1
00:00:04,096 --> 00:00:10,240
Alexandra Thurston color

2
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:18,688
Seems like Lagunitas

3
00:00:19,456 --> 00:00:20,992
Strong rotation

4
00:00:22,528 --> 00:00:28,672
I'm running out to go to the liquor store I pretty much picked out just about every novelty beer and drink that I

5
00:00:28,928 --> 00:00:32,256
I can find their wheel well

6
00:00:32,512 --> 00:00:36,352
It's for sure you definitely fear that direction

7
00:00:36,864 --> 00:00:37,632
You're in first

8
00:00:41,728 --> 00:00:42,240
You're going to mess with

9
00:00:42,496 --> 00:00:48,640
Coriander

10
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,528
Rascal

11
00:00:56,832 --> 00:00:59,648
That's a great opening

12
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:10,656
Explain show

13
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:17,056
It's evolved into everywhere

14
00:01:19,104 --> 00:01:19,616
You know

15
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:26,016
Talk about you for a while

16
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:30,112
Episode

17
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:33,696
And he had a very good

18
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:35,232
Request request

19
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,328
I'm very mad at him for giving me this request

20
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:41,376
Go down

21
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:52,896
It's not his fault I appreciate it on the other level cuz I got to learn the number 3

22
00:01:53,408 --> 00:01:54,432
That are a lot of fun

23
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:55,456
Anchored introduced

24
00:01:55,712 --> 00:01:56,480
Doesn't folks that I wouldn't

25
00:01:56,736 --> 00:01:57,248
Otherwise

26
00:01:57,504 --> 00:02:01,088
But then I'm putting together a book

27
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:03,392
To keep track of everything much more

28
00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:04,672
Completely much more like

29
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:05,440
To-do list

30
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:09,024
Yeah sort of thing trying to organize my life and my bills

31
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,608
Right and so I wanted to take a second to recognize

32
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:15,168
The time-travel episode but there are others

33
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:15,936
Better,

34
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:19,264
Because I haven't been done

35
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,544
Because I keep forgetting

36
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:21,312
And that's

37
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:22,080
My bad

38
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:28,480
Alright I'm working on it we will make everything right apologize for all the stuff that you

39
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:32,576
You haven't been doing

40
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:33,600
There's another element

41
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:35,392
1

42
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:38,720
Time travel episode that I've been putting off a little bit

43
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:40,512
Not for not wanting

44
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,120
Explain it

45
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:47,680
No need to beat around the bush about why

46
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:49,472
Absolute listener gym

47
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:51,264
Who came and visited we had to

48
00:02:53,568 --> 00:02:56,384
He requested I believe you requested his birthday

49
00:02:58,432 --> 00:03:00,480
The episode that I found for his birthday

50
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:02,784
Was when Benjamin Netanyahu came to

51
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:03,552
The United States

52
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:05,088
Oh that's right

53
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:05,856
And it's

54
00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:07,648
Complicated because Alex

55
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:09,440
Interstate Batteries

56
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:10,976
Pro-israel but

57
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:14,816
Pro sovereignty difficult

58
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:16,608
To sort of get into

59
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:19,424
But I realize why I've been putting that off

60
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,728
Is because when we were in 2009

61
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:23,008
And we are looking at him

62
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:24,800
Be very pro-palestinian

63
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:26,080
And fairly auntie

64
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:27,104
The state of Israel

65
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:28,896
I don't think

66
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:30,688
Jumping forward to that point

67
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:33,248
When he's going to say pro-israel thing

68
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,296
He's necessarily all that

69
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:36,832
Interesting for our

70
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:38,112
Pass through this

71
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:40,672
I'd like to get to that episode where Netanyahu

72
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:42,720
Comes to America eventually

73
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:43,488
Well

74
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:45,536
Not necessarily organically but I think

75
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:47,840
But it does all of us much more

76
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:48,608
In terms of

77
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:49,888
Understanding

78
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,168
And learning

79
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:53,472
Pivot

80
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:58,336
Towards being pro-israel

81
00:03:58,592 --> 00:03:59,616
Result eventually

82
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:00,640
So I think I am

83
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:02,432
It's difficult for me

84
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:04,480
Need to get myself to do that episode

85
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:05,248
Because

86
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,296
I want to watch him change

87
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:08,064
As opposed to

88
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:08,832
See him

89
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:10,880
Post change and then go back and watch

90
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:15,232
Flick from a structure of our show standpoint

91
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:16,000
It feels weird

92
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:18,303
Yeah this is my way of saying an apology

93
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:22,399
The gym

94
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:31,871
If he has another suggest

95
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:33,663
You should feel free to

96
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:35,711
Tell me

97
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:36,735
Talking about his real name

98
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:39,807
Wright's just from a narrative storytelling structure I think

99
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:40,575
Byblos

100
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:41,855
Are 2009

101
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:46,975
If you have one that you think I've forgotten about which is entirely

102
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:53,887
Maybe it's maybe four if you haven't donated on that level and you want to try and trick me

103
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:55,423
Very welcome

104
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:58,751
Please send me an email and I will start putting together my to do list

105
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:01,055
To get everything in order will be

106
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:02,591
Rock and roll in

107
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:04,639
As they said

108
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:05,919
Back in the old

109
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:13,087
It sure is that what that is that what they said in the old

110
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:14,367
So Jordan today

111
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:19,743
We have a time travel episode that is not an Alex Jones space time travel episode

112
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:20,511
Is an inch

113
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:23,071
Since we're actually got in touch

114
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:26,399
One of The Inspirations

115
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:29,983
I'll bring Jim Bakker in

116
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:33,823
Search about how I

117
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:35,103
He was right in line with the

118
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:38,175
Pecan man stuff

119
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:42,015
I look at him

120
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:43,807
And he had

121
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:47,135
The Jim Bakker Show

122
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:53,023
Distance from

123
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:54,303
7 through 10

124
00:05:54,559 --> 00:05:55,071
Noh8

125
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:57,375
I'm not sure

126
00:05:57,631 --> 00:05:59,167
Few days in 2015

127
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:00,447
Oh that's my birthday

128
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:06,335
3 days

129
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:07,359
You know what

130
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:08,127
Jim Bakker

131
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:10,943
If you just record that all and then put that out

132
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:14,015
Chunks

133
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:16,319
I just assumed that you would take that

134
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:19,135
White guy why would you know that

135
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:24,255
Glories on Grace Street with their gas

136
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:27,583
And they probably record something to the tune of like 4 hours

137
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:28,607
Of them

138
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:29,631
Talkingshit

139
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:32,191
And then he cuts it up and he doesn't

140
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:38,847
Stepney releases it throughout the week

141
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:40,127
As if it was multiple

142
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:43,967
Like 1 hour segments

143
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:50,367
It maximizes

144
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:56,767
For 3 hours and

145
00:06:57,023 --> 00:07:02,143
You know it's called time-consuming and maximizing effort while minimizing profit

146
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:05,983
Production crew

147
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:11,871
Here is an out of

148
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:13,407
Text dropped from Today Show

149
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:14,943
Netflix

150
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:18,271
Is a fulfillment of Prophecy

151
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:19,039
Chrissy from me

152
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:20,575
Me too

153
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:26,207
There was

154
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:28,767
There is no and it went

155
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:32,607
There's no

156
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:37,727
It's going to be the devil

157
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:40,287
I did not see it coming as his own profit

158
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:41,823
Is a fulfillment

159
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:45,919
His brother

160
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:49,503
How come you wasn't on the ground floor then

161
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:51,807
What time is bedtime

162
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:54,367
That's why

163
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:56,415
Dead or alive

164
00:07:57,695 --> 00:07:58,207
Steel horse

165
00:07:58,463 --> 00:07:59,999
I got a ride

166
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:02,559
So

167
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:05,119
We're going to get into this

168
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:08,703
Wait to steal horses a train

169
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:10,495
Yeah there's a motorcycle

170
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:11,775
It could be

171
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:12,543
You're right

172
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:15,615
I always allow motorcycles aren't made of steel I know that's

173
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:21,759
I always

174
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:26,879
What is gold bullion

175
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:31,743
It's a soup

176
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:38,143
It's like a rich people that like they put gold flakes on top of your job

177
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:40,703
Treated as one episode

178
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:44,287
It doesn't really matter where the brakes are from the days already

179
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:48,383
Intro 3

180
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:50,175
Listen to it

181
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:58,367
What's the Christmas special

182
00:08:58,623 --> 00:09:02,975
Good night music

183
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:07,071
Slides in with that flourish

184
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:15,007
Junior High Musical soundtrack

185
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:17,311
Sickeningly clothes

186
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:50,591
Spinners bad

187
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:56,991
How old

188
00:09:57,247 --> 00:09:59,295
No

189
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:10,559
Have some restraint act like you've been there before great out it's never the same introducer is

190
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:13,119
The guy who's leaving the bank

191
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:15,167
What do they cost

192
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:18,751
Do they have it do they have weekend I can't speak today but I do know that

193
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:20,543
The table is a little crowded

194
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:24,383
That's not entirely true

195
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:27,967
Defacto co-host

196
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:28,735
She's not Lori

197
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:30,015
Yokai named Zach

198
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:32,575
He's around a lot

199
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:38,207
Was he in a different

200
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:43,327
I don't know if you should have done that

201
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:46,655
10:25 Morningview

202
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:49,471
It's a perfect place to hide

203
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:55,615
No one with you, everyone's arms employees have guns

204
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:56,383
Haven't

205
00:10:56,639 --> 00:11:00,223
Masturbated

206
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:07,647
Or should I say picerne

207
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:08,671
Hahaha

208
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:11,231
That's right

209
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:11,999
Right now

210
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:14,559
In the middle of a large

211
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:17,119
Not funny

212
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:20,959
And it's amazing

213
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:24,031
The scientists are looking for God

214
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:25,823
Nope

215
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:30,687
Approved

216
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:34,527
So this show is going to have a lot to do with CERN

217
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:36,319
That's good I like

218
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:42,463
A lot of the research that I did have nothing

219
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:48,095
You knowing a bit about it

220
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:50,143
I know enough to know number one

221
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:51,167
Not looking for God

222
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:52,191
I like

223
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:54,495
The Large Hadron Collider

224
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:04,991
Technological research

225
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:06,015
They've done

226
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:06,783
Organizations

227
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:08,831
52

228
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:09,855
Like it's not like

229
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:12,159
Yeah you're nodding

230
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:14,719
Really dismissively at mix

231
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:18,303
Up until this point

232
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:24,191
We weren't able to generate we weren't able to fire protons and the like with enough

233
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:27,519
Measure the effects that measure the particles

234
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:28,543
That could be created

235
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:32,639
Built up

236
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:33,663
You know like

237
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:35,199
What is it creates a black hole

238
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:36,991
As if that was a thing

239
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:38,527
Play 88

240
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:39,551
It's really fast

241
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:40,319
I would look into it

242
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:43,135
There's also another one not necessarily the same

243
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:44,671
Thing is that the kleider but

244
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:46,207
It's also being built

245
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:49,791
Why can't I remember any of this

246
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:55,935
The Higgs boson

247
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:56,959
I wish

248
00:12:57,215 --> 00:12:58,239
With kind of an

249
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:05,151
Is a really fascinating thing 2013

250
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:08,735
But the fact is that wasn't confirmed

251
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:13,855
That the Higgs boson was what we thought it was in the standard model

252
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:15,903
It's a very fascinating

253
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:17,951
He's going to come in at a certain

254
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:22,047
Prove it that would disprove the standard model

255
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:23,327
Or another way that way

256
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:24,607
Perfectly prove it

257
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:27,423
Came in the middle and end

258
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:34,079
Make a recording of these guys

259
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:40,479
I'm not going to talk about crazy nonsense

260
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:43,551
The question becomes

261
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:45,343
When do we get into strength

262
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:46,367
How far away

263
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:49,439
That's not the question the question is

264
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:51,999
Those f****** scientists up to

265
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:54,559
Very very important

266
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:55,327
Book

267
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:57,631
Of the immortal

268
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:00,447
Wasn't drinking right there

269
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:05,823
Also also sounds like a Jedi mind trick album title

270
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:10,687
The top tap that they are at

271
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:14,015
They want to make contact with the Immortals work kind of warning

272
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:17,599
Contact with him it's not going to be pretty

273
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:19,647
What wow

274
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:24,767
Today

275
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:26,047
News

276
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:26,815
As well

277
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:28,351
We had amazing stories

278
00:14:28,863 --> 00:14:30,143
Amazing news Jimmy

279
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:31,167
There we go

280
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:32,703
I mean what more could you ask for

281
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:35,775
Their scientists are looking for the Immortals

282
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:37,823
Name of the book

283
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:41,151
But what they're actually doing you see is that they're trying

284
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:41,919
Create

285
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:43,711
Some sort of the connection where they can

286
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:44,479
Communicate with

287
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:45,759
Open up a portal

288
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:47,039
Another dimension

289
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:47,807
That's what he say

290
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:49,855
Well first off

291
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:51,391
Based on his voice alone

292
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:55,487
Banana

293
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:57,791
How does a human being make those sounds out of his

294
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:00,095
Listen to his voice again

295
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:00,863
It is

296
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:01,887
Disgusting

297
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:02,655
Eighth grade

298
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:04,191
Any

299
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:06,751
It's gross

300
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:20,063
As annoying except that allow it

301
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:22,623
Your voice has spectacular and I could listen to it for

302
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:25,439
A little bit Petty about

303
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:27,231
I know what character is

304
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:29,023
Rustic but you know it does come from the jowls

305
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:29,791
Probably

306
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:32,607
Probably hasn't

307
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:35,679
No matter what you say about his voice or anything like that

308
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:36,959
Can't argue that he has a

309
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:38,495
The grass on the science

310
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:39,519
Listen to that

311
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:40,799
Sometimes

312
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:43,871
Is that right

313
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:50,783
These programs are playing on television this thing will be revving up

314
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:52,575
To the most power

315
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:56,415
The face of the Earth

316
00:15:57,183 --> 00:15:59,487
Are we going to accelerate

317
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:00,767
Hundreds of Millions

318
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:01,791
The proton

319
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:05,887
Inside of the tubes that you can see their behind us

320
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:08,447
To just beneath the speed of light

321
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:11,775
Then they're going to compress them down to a human hair

322
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:16,383
And they're going to call Mini of 600 million particles

323
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:21,247
This is never happened on Earth before unless maybe it was windy

324
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:24,575
First time

325
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:25,855
Around

326
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:26,879
What's

327
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:31,231
Protons down to a human hairs with

328
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:32,511
How many protons

329
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:33,279
Does he think

330
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:36,607
Oh man

331
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:39,679
Probably like 16

332
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:48,639
6 equals

333
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:51,199
Okay here's Witt

334
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:53,247
This is crazy

335
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:56,831
So is that the go is that like the

336
00:16:57,087 --> 00:16:59,903
EU standard of measurement cuz you know we use

337
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:04,767
It's imperial measurement

338
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:09,119
Is down-home European slang for a quarter

339
00:17:10,143 --> 00:17:11,423
The size of a quark

340
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:15,775
So is he talking about that

341
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:18,335
I'm not sure I don't think he knows but if

342
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:19,615
Alright

343
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:23,199
I'm not I'm not going to

344
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:24,479
Trust somebody

345
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:30,111
Who eat like uses that as like a like a measurement that they're going to compress

346
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:35,231
Protons that have been collided down to hundreds of millions of protein

347
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:37,023
Sure

348
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:37,791
With

349
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:42,399
That's like almost 2,000 Angelique 109

350
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:47,263
You still treating this one at a time

351
00:17:48,031 --> 00:17:49,055
Hundreds of millions attire

352
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:50,335
I don't know man

353
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:52,127
The dishes

354
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:56,223
Scholars

355
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:57,247
Jim Bakker about it

356
00:17:57,503 --> 00:17:58,015
Jim

357
00:17:58,527 --> 00:17:59,807
Is coming at it from a real

358
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:02,623
He don't really know that

359
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:06,975
North

360
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:09,279
Here is the picture

361
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:17,471
Who is

362
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:19,519
Is God alive

363
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:21,823
Find the God particle

364
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:23,359
Very different thing

365
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:25,407
He thinks it's literal

366
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:26,175
You guys called

367
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:26,943
The God particle

368
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:29,759
Jim Baker thinks it's

369
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:32,575
Literally like particles of God

370
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:33,855
What is God

371
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:35,135
Who is God

372
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:37,439
Questions that scientists are all that

373
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:40,255
Not really but not really they're bad

374
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:44,351
The audience of solid

375
00:18:44,863 --> 00:18:47,167
Explain the importance of

376
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:49,215
Well the idea is

377
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:51,263
We don't know why gravity

378
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:52,799
There's always matter

379
00:18:53,055 --> 00:18:56,383
Is gravity a

380
00:18:56,639 --> 00:18:59,967
Particle is it a characteristic is there something that

381
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:01,503
Endows

382
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:02,783
Things with

383
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:03,807
Matter with grab

384
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:10,719
With all of it that we don't actually know why it happened and every time we look into it it only gets more obtuse

385
00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:13,791
And every time you do more experiments they almost

386
00:19:14,047 --> 00:19:14,559
Seem to contradict

387
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:15,327
Each other half the

388
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:17,631
And then you got the standard model with

389
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:19,679
Predicts what we think we're going to find

390
00:19:21,471 --> 00:19:22,239
For the most part

391
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:23,519
Makes perfect sense

392
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:25,567
Right up until you get to things like

393
00:19:25,823 --> 00:19:26,591
Dark matter

394
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:28,639
And Phaeton and things that we just

395
00:19:28,895 --> 00:19:29,663
Can't measure

396
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:31,455
We have no idea how to measure

397
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:34,783
So what they're really looking for is some sort of confirmation

398
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:36,575
Of the standard model

399
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:37,343
Or

400
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:38,111
Some

401
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:40,671
Other model or something

402
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:45,535
The standard model being wrong and

403
00:19:46,303 --> 00:19:48,095
All are we start getting into crazy

404
00:19:52,703 --> 00:19:53,215
That's

405
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:56,287
That's what I hear are they making

406
00:19:56,543 --> 00:20:02,687
Probably bigger show

407
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:05,759
Gravity

408
00:20:06,015 --> 00:20:07,807
And if we can create gravity

409
00:20:08,063 --> 00:20:09,087
What

410
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:13,951
Now you're starting to sound like a paranoid

411
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:14,719
She fears

412
00:20:15,231 --> 00:20:15,999
I was just never

413
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:16,767
Best thing

414
00:20:18,047 --> 00:20:18,559
Never great

415
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:21,887
Although I think it's probably very consistent that you would

416
00:20:22,143 --> 00:20:24,703
Embody that would be afraid of

417
00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:27,519
I think that's probably

418
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:29,823
They're afraid of

419
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:30,847
There's one aspect

420
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:31,871
Concerned

421
00:20:32,127 --> 00:20:32,895
Not stop talking

422
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:35,967
Lottery

423
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:42,367
Sheba

424
00:20:45,183 --> 00:20:49,535
Discombobulated the world

425
00:20:52,095 --> 00:20:55,935
And what Tom just said I want to reiterate that point

426
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:06,687
Okay well I was right

427
00:21:06,943 --> 00:21:07,455
Pooja

428
00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:10,271
Mini X in religion

429
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:13,087
Why would they have a God put the got back on the

430
00:21:13,343 --> 00:21:13,855
Screen mando

431
00:21:14,623 --> 00:21:15,903
There's the god

432
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:20,768
Outside the doors

433
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:28,704
Why would he be there

434
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:34,848
Square ice

435
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:36,384
It is called

436
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,920
Perez

437
00:21:38,944 --> 00:21:45,088
Placement

438
00:21:45,344 --> 00:21:45,856
Take the rails

439
00:21:46,112 --> 00:21:49,696
All those idiots

440
00:21:51,232 --> 00:21:55,840
No way coming back over and over again serve like

441
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:00,704
It was a gift from the government of India the state of Indiana

442
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,240
Because they were

443
00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:03,264
Associate

444
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:04,800
Start working on

445
00:22:05,056 --> 00:22:08,128
I want to write

446
00:22:08,384 --> 00:22:09,408
Writing

447
00:22:11,968 --> 00:22:15,296
Postdoc student quote

448
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:17,856
Is teaming with life

449
00:22:18,112 --> 00:22:20,160
Chivas teams play for University

450
00:22:20,928 --> 00:22:21,696
We shaking things up

451
00:22:21,952 --> 00:22:22,976
Making itself

452
00:22:23,488 --> 00:22:26,048
Never up never static

453
00:22:28,352 --> 00:22:29,376
Contemplate the deeper questions

454
00:22:29,632 --> 00:22:30,144
Literally

455
00:22:30,656 --> 00:22:31,936
The long Shadow over our work

456
00:22:32,448 --> 00:22:33,984
A bit like the Shadows on Plato's Cave

457
00:22:34,752 --> 00:22:37,056
Chiba remind me that when we still don't know the

458
00:22:37,312 --> 00:22:39,360
Answer to one of biggest the biggest question

459
00:22:39,616 --> 00:22:40,128
Presented by the unit

460
00:22:40,896 --> 00:22:42,176
I am at Everytime We collide

461
00:22:42,688 --> 00:22:43,200
We must take

462
00:22:43,456 --> 00:22:43,968
Cosmic balance

463
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:47,296
So I'm going to stay

464
00:22:47,552 --> 00:22:48,064
Real quick

465
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:50,880
Nerd

466
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:54,464
Look what it's like whatever you hear somebody who's intelligent talk

467
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:57,280
Right listen to those words

468
00:22:57,792 --> 00:23:01,888
And then compare them with what I stumbled over a couple of them

469
00:23:04,192 --> 00:23:10,080
This is the this is B false

470
00:23:13,152 --> 00:23:15,456
Further explained

471
00:23:15,712 --> 00:23:16,992
The Tower of the Dallas physics

472
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:19,552
Toshiba symbolizes all

473
00:23:21,344 --> 00:23:22,880
At the same time she reminds us that

474
00:23:23,392 --> 00:23:25,440
Manifold forms in the world are not fundamental but a loser

475
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:26,208
Never change

476
00:23:26,464 --> 00:23:29,024
I need you to stop using words like manifold

477
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:29,792
An illusory

478
00:23:30,048 --> 00:23:33,376
If we've got Jim Bakker listening's knowledge not understand

479
00:23:35,424 --> 00:23:36,192
Creation and destruction

480
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:37,472
Is not only manifested

481
00:23:37,728 --> 00:23:38,240
In the turn of the Seas

482
00:23:39,264 --> 00:23:40,800
Birth and death of all living

483
00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:41,824
Creatures but also

484
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:42,848
In the very essence

485
00:23:43,104 --> 00:23:43,616
Inorganic

486
00:23:44,384 --> 00:23:45,920
So there's a lot of very nice

487
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:46,944
Poetic Waynesville

488
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,480
You couldn't work in it

489
00:23:48,736 --> 00:23:49,504
The idea of

490
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:53,344
Everything

491
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,392
You don't have to do religiously

492
00:23:55,648 --> 00:23:56,928
You can just do it poetically

493
00:23:58,464 --> 00:23:59,744
Good guys

494
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,280
Know who Shiba is

495
00:24:01,536 --> 00:24:03,328
Write these guys are like

496
00:24:04,096 --> 00:24:04,864
This

497
00:24:05,888 --> 00:24:06,912
Is out here

498
00:24:08,704 --> 00:24:09,728
Any like you

499
00:24:09,984 --> 00:24:10,752
Do not know anything about

500
00:24:13,312 --> 00:24:15,872
Keep saying

501
00:24:16,896 --> 00:24:17,920
That's something

502
00:24:18,432 --> 00:24:20,736
So crisp

503
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:25,856
Austin peace during the

504
00:24:29,696 --> 00:24:30,208
51 diet

505
00:24:30,464 --> 00:24:31,232
Surprisingly

506
00:24:32,256 --> 00:24:33,024
What I could glean

507
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,560
I would guess it was a heart attack

508
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:38,656
I don't

509
00:24:39,168 --> 00:24:39,680
Don't take any

510
00:24:40,448 --> 00:24:41,728
Enjoyment

511
00:24:46,336 --> 00:24:48,128
He is nuts

512
00:24:48,384 --> 00:24:50,176
And he jumps in here

513
00:24:50,688 --> 00:24:51,200
Explain

514
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:52,992
That

515
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:55,808
Prove God

516
00:24:56,832 --> 00:24:58,112
And just to put it really simple

517
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,440
Einstein discovered in Winter discovery

518
00:25:01,696 --> 00:25:02,720
The smaller they get

519
00:25:02,976 --> 00:25:03,744
Gimmick

520
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:04,512
The best

521
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,560
The Observer

522
00:25:06,816 --> 00:25:07,584
Effects reality

523
00:25:09,376 --> 00:25:10,144
It looks like

524
00:25:10,912 --> 00:25:12,960
Like I said

525
00:25:13,728 --> 00:25:14,240
Now

526
00:25:14,496 --> 00:25:15,520
It's actually both

527
00:25:15,776 --> 00:25:16,544
Until somebody looks

528
00:25:17,056 --> 00:25:19,360
When you look at it actually determine what state

529
00:25:20,128 --> 00:25:21,920
Which is really odd

530
00:25:22,176 --> 00:25:22,688
Given

531
00:25:24,736 --> 00:25:25,248
That wouldn't make

532
00:25:25,504 --> 00:25:27,040
Why would your mind

533
00:25:27,296 --> 00:25:28,576
Have any effect over reality

534
00:25:29,088 --> 00:25:31,392
Always proving our worldview

535
00:25:31,904 --> 00:25:32,928
No

536
00:25:33,184 --> 00:25:34,720
Mindset whether they realize it or not

537
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,304
R&R soul

538
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:39,584
Our essence

539
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,120
Actually affects physical reality

540
00:25:41,376 --> 00:25:42,400
In a way so we really don't

541
00:25:42,656 --> 00:25:43,424
Nope

542
00:25:44,192 --> 00:25:44,960
Not how that works at all

543
00:25:45,216 --> 00:25:47,520
Improving is that

544
00:25:47,776 --> 00:25:49,312
Light effects

545
00:25:49,824 --> 00:25:50,336
Lights

546
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:54,176
Not that the human mind

547
00:25:54,432 --> 00:25:57,248
It's not that when we observe it we force the way from

548
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:02,112
To collapse we have to shine light on it which then

549
00:26:03,392 --> 00:26:04,672
It's not like our eyes are doing

550
00:26:05,184 --> 00:26:05,696
No it's alright

551
00:26:06,976 --> 00:26:09,792
Play I don't know a whole lot about quantum physics

552
00:26:10,048 --> 00:26:12,352
Let's not area of study that I am

553
00:26:12,608 --> 00:26:13,888
I'm not even really

554
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,936
Conversant in it necessarily

555
00:26:16,704 --> 00:26:21,824
Watch some YouTube videos

556
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:27,200
Einstein wasn't

557
00:26:27,456 --> 00:26:28,736
No no there's a little bit after

558
00:26:31,808 --> 00:26:32,320
You know

559
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,112
What are you

560
00:26:34,624 --> 00:26:37,696
Idis is one of those things that like I think

561
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:38,976
You know uncertain

562
00:26:39,744 --> 00:26:44,864
Rules

563
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:49,472
Really bring up this

564
00:26:51,264 --> 00:26:52,032
Form of science

565
00:26:52,288 --> 00:26:52,800
It's most

566
00:26:53,056 --> 00:26:53,568
Easily abused

567
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:55,872
Right by people who haven't

568
00:26:56,384 --> 00:26:59,712
Especially since the people who do know about it also agree

569
00:27:00,224 --> 00:27:01,760
Nobody really knows that much about

570
00:27:03,296 --> 00:27:07,904
Going to be like

571
00:27:12,768 --> 00:27:13,792
People don't guitar

572
00:27:14,048 --> 00:27:15,584
It without studying it don't really

573
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:19,168
These guys have

574
00:27:19,936 --> 00:27:21,728
If you are talking to a quantum physics

575
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,520
You're eventually going to get

576
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:24,800
To the point where they say

577
00:27:26,336 --> 00:27:27,360
We can measure

578
00:27:27,616 --> 00:27:29,152
And I can tell you that this is true

579
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,712
But the stuff that we can't measure

580
00:27:31,968 --> 00:27:32,992
Is so great

581
00:27:33,504 --> 00:27:35,040
That I can't tell you that

582
00:27:45,024 --> 00:27:47,328
The f****** you a****** we're not looking

583
00:27:47,584 --> 00:27:49,376
We're not trying to open a portal

584
00:27:49,888 --> 00:27:51,936
But

585
00:27:52,192 --> 00:27:54,240
So far a lot of this is just

586
00:27:54,752 --> 00:27:55,264
Still

587
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,056
A little bit of laying the groundwork

588
00:27:57,824 --> 00:27:59,360
Is going to spin off the rails

589
00:27:59,616 --> 00:28:00,128
Pretty hard

590
00:28:01,664 --> 00:28:02,432
I believe

591
00:28:02,688 --> 00:28:08,832
But it starts misrepresenting experiment has already made me angry at the

592
00:28:09,088 --> 00:28:13,440
How far off the rails is gone off the rails Safari off the rails

593
00:28:13,696 --> 00:28:15,488
I have one piece of evidence

594
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:16,512
There it is

595
00:28:16,768 --> 00:28:17,280
Damping

596
00:28:17,792 --> 00:28:19,584
Did Jim Bakker doesn't have

597
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,120
And that is guest still.

598
00:28:21,376 --> 00:28:21,888
Hold on

599
00:28:25,728 --> 00:28:26,240
That I look

600
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:27,520
Gintama coulibaly

601
00:28:27,776 --> 00:28:29,312
Disqualifying

602
00:28:31,616 --> 00:28:32,640
Ever read the Bible

603
00:28:32,896 --> 00:28:35,200
Or has ever studied read the Bible

604
00:28:35,456 --> 00:28:39,808
Studies of Christianity

605
00:28:40,064 --> 00:28:40,576
I think it's

606
00:28:40,832 --> 00:28:41,600
You don't know this

607
00:28:41,856 --> 00:28:43,392
Information

608
00:28:43,648 --> 00:28:48,512
I think it's one of those times when I wish I got them

609
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:52,352
This is one of those times where I feel so miserable that I couldn't

610
00:28:52,608 --> 00:28:56,192
Talk about

611
00:28:56,704 --> 00:29:02,848
Information is spinning around in my head but now I'm trying to improve it and pull it from all kinds of different directions

612
00:29:03,104 --> 00:29:05,920
I'm going to sound like an idiot I should have texted you

613
00:29:06,432 --> 00:29:11,552
Brush remember movie

614
00:29:12,064 --> 00:29:12,576
You're doing good

615
00:29:12,832 --> 00:29:15,136
Everything goes off the rails

616
00:29:15,648 --> 00:29:16,160
Starting

617
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:17,440
Hey Miss Mexico

618
00:29:19,232 --> 00:29:20,768
Verify a parallel reality

619
00:29:21,792 --> 00:29:22,560
Remember correctly

620
00:29:24,608 --> 00:29:27,168
Bible days when they were building a tower

621
00:29:28,192 --> 00:29:29,472
Call babbel or B baby

622
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:32,032
Tower

623
00:29:32,544 --> 00:29:33,056
2

624
00:29:35,104 --> 00:29:35,616
Is that right

625
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:38,688
If my mind

626
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:39,712
Correctly

627
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:40,992
They

628
00:29:41,248 --> 00:29:41,760
They look

629
00:29:42,272 --> 00:29:43,040
For more of a

630
00:29:43,296 --> 00:29:44,576
A doorway to heaven

631
00:29:47,648 --> 00:29:48,672
You're not going to build

632
00:29:48,928 --> 00:29:50,464
A Stairway or a tower

633
00:29:50,976 --> 00:29:51,744
And walk up

634
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:52,512
I'm going to have

635
00:29:54,048 --> 00:29:54,560
You can't

636
00:29:57,376 --> 00:30:02,752
I don't think they were trying to build just a tower that would get out and say hi.

637
00:30:03,264 --> 00:30:03,776
Good morning

638
00:30:04,032 --> 00:30:06,080
Good morning

639
00:30:06,336 --> 00:30:08,640
What time is it at what time zone does God live

640
00:30:11,712 --> 00:30:14,272
Upper Crust

641
00:30:14,528 --> 00:30:15,808
Subscribed

642
00:30:19,648 --> 00:30:22,208
Fair play to you

643
00:30:22,464 --> 00:30:23,744
I suppose

644
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,024
You can climb high enough

645
00:30:26,048 --> 00:30:28,352
I would call I'm glad he does know that

646
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:29,632
That's good

647
00:30:29,888 --> 00:30:31,936
That suggests a basic understanding of science

648
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,520
Is in sharp contrast

649
00:30:35,776 --> 00:30:36,800
With his co-host

650
00:30:37,056 --> 00:30:37,824
Who comes in with this

651
00:30:38,848 --> 00:30:40,128
Another crazy thing is this

652
00:30:41,408 --> 00:30:42,176
Possibly

653
00:30:42,432 --> 00:30:43,200
Gotten to heaven

654
00:30:45,248 --> 00:30:46,016
What they have

655
00:30:46,528 --> 00:30:48,064
If God wouldn't have destroyed them

656
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:52,160
With an emphatic answer

657
00:30:52,672 --> 00:30:55,744
I expected him to say no unfortunately

658
00:30:56,768 --> 00:30:57,280
Yes

659
00:30:57,536 --> 00:30:58,560
Yes they what up

660
00:30:59,072 --> 00:31:01,888
Genesis chapter 11

661
00:31:02,656 --> 00:31:07,264
But it's built ourselves

662
00:31:07,776 --> 00:31:13,920
We may make a name for ourselves

663
00:31:14,688 --> 00:31:16,992
To see the city and the tower the people were building

664
00:31:17,504 --> 00:31:21,088
First of all I love the idea of like God coming down just to see it by

665
00:31:21,344 --> 00:31:25,440
Well actually the real problem was

666
00:31:25,696 --> 00:31:26,720
You hanging a toes

667
00:31:26,976 --> 00:31:30,048
Off the edge of Heaven for a while and they almost brushed up on the

668
00:31:30,304 --> 00:31:33,376
He's like no I got to stop this s*** there f****** with my fishing

669
00:31:33,632 --> 00:31:37,728
Strongly disagree I think what happened is it one of God's buddies came over as I can

670
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:43,360
She becomes over his name

671
00:31:43,872 --> 00:31:50,016
Shower

672
00:31:50,272 --> 00:31:56,416
Grocery store come on

673
00:31:58,720 --> 00:31:59,232
Are you ready for this

674
00:32:00,256 --> 00:32:03,584
If I was one people speaking the same language they begun to do this

675
00:32:04,352 --> 00:32:04,864
Then

676
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:05,632
Nothing

677
00:32:06,144 --> 00:32:07,168
They plan to do

678
00:32:07,424 --> 00:32:08,192
Will be impossible

679
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:09,728
The very thing

680
00:32:09,984 --> 00:32:11,008
The god of the universe

681
00:32:11,776 --> 00:32:12,288
He said

682
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:14,336
That nothing they do with the Impala

683
00:32:15,616 --> 00:32:17,152
Case of the very thing

684
00:32:19,712 --> 00:32:20,224
So

685
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:27,648
That's going to be a really don't understand

686
00:32:29,184 --> 00:32:30,720
So even biblical literalism

687
00:32:31,232 --> 00:32:31,744
I like

688
00:32:32,256 --> 00:32:33,280
They weren't actually building

689
00:32:33,536 --> 00:32:34,048
The Tower 2

690
00:32:35,072 --> 00:32:35,584
Guys

691
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:36,608
You can't do

692
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,144
Well

693
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:38,912
Upstairs

694
00:32:39,168 --> 00:32:42,496
Tower of Babel

695
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:43,264
Does not exist

696
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:44,032
The Bible

697
00:32:45,056 --> 00:32:46,336
Also it's not a real thing

698
00:32:48,384 --> 00:32:49,152
Etiology

699
00:32:49,408 --> 00:32:54,528
Which is like a little story people have different languages

700
00:32:54,784 --> 00:32:58,368
Teach children against the idea of hubris against God that sort of thing

701
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:01,440
Similar to this other myth

702
00:33:02,464 --> 00:33:06,560
It's like a it's like a big one in the public consciousness

703
00:33:07,072 --> 00:33:09,376
Led Zeppelin reference at one time

704
00:33:10,912 --> 00:33:11,936
It's that guy

705
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:13,728
Dyer maker

706
00:33:15,776 --> 00:33:17,568
Went up like really close

707
00:33:17,824 --> 00:33:19,360
Yeah there you go

708
00:33:26,016 --> 00:33:28,064
Cigarettes

709
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:33,696
Flying Too Close to the sun more literal analogues throughout his

710
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:34,720
Different cultures

711
00:33:34,976 --> 00:33:38,816
The Sumerian myth about Ember cars it's a Mexican tale about the

712
00:33:39,072 --> 00:33:41,120
Construction of the Pyramid of Cholula

713
00:33:41,376 --> 00:33:42,144
There's a bunch of different

714
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:44,960
Conversions throughout Africa and even some in Tibet

715
00:33:45,216 --> 00:33:49,568
Who tried to figure out exactly like is it possible that there was a

716
00:33:49,824 --> 00:33:50,848
The Tower of Babel that this

717
00:33:51,104 --> 00:33:52,128
It's like something that

718
00:33:52,384 --> 00:33:54,432
Actually comes down from history

719
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:55,968
And there was a ziggurat

720
00:33:56,224 --> 00:33:56,736
Dedicated

721
00:33:56,992 --> 00:33:57,504
Tamar Duke

722
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:02,112
In Babylon called

723
00:34:02,368 --> 00:34:05,440
Historical context

724
00:34:05,696 --> 00:34:06,208
Story The Bible

725
00:34:06,464 --> 00:34:06,976
Was referring to

726
00:34:07,232 --> 00:34:13,120
What are the chief problem being that the Tower of Babel was said to be billed under Nimrod which would have been around 2,000 BC

727
00:34:13,632 --> 00:34:16,960
Is almost certainly from around 12

728
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:20,288
Is it possible to tell for sure

729
00:34:20,544 --> 00:34:22,080
Destroyed and 689 b.c.

730
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:25,920
I was just ride along with

731
00:34:26,432 --> 00:34:27,712
Either way

732
00:34:28,224 --> 00:34:30,528
It was built

733
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:32,320
About 300 ft tall

734
00:34:32,832 --> 00:34:35,904
But for comparison that's less than half the height of these

735
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:36,672
Chicago Board of

736
00:34:36,928 --> 00:34:37,440
Building

737
00:34:37,952 --> 00:34:41,792
The 44th tallest building in Chicago crazy about that building

738
00:34:42,304 --> 00:34:43,584
It's about to be taken down by God

739
00:34:44,096 --> 00:34:45,120
It got a little too close

740
00:34:45,376 --> 00:34:48,448
Everyone they're speaking the same language real close

741
00:34:48,704 --> 00:34:52,544
Nothing is impossible for these people who speak the same language

742
00:34:53,056 --> 00:34:56,896
Tear down that wall mr. God there's also

743
00:34:57,152 --> 00:34:58,944
Even the story that they're missing and not

744
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:03,808
Dealing with meta is the idea that God is affirming that if people work together there

745
00:35:04,064 --> 00:35:05,600
Their boundless potential

746
00:35:05,856 --> 00:35:09,696
Furthermore it is suggesting that God is afraid of

747
00:35:09,952 --> 00:35:14,304
People or is it invested in them not working together

748
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:16,608
In some ways

749
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:18,400
No

750
00:35:18,656 --> 00:35:19,424
Yeah it so I mean

751
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:20,960
Keep coming back to this

752
00:35:21,216 --> 00:35:21,728
I'm trying to

753
00:35:21,984 --> 00:35:23,520
Compare CERN to the Tower of Babel

754
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:25,824
Whatever

755
00:35:26,592 --> 00:35:27,360
Whatever

756
00:35:28,128 --> 00:35:32,480
It's only because that one theme of the story The hubristic

757
00:35:32,736 --> 00:35:33,248
God

758
00:35:33,504 --> 00:35:34,272
Is what they're trying to

759
00:35:34,528 --> 00:35:35,040
2

760
00:35:35,296 --> 00:35:35,808
Create a

761
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:39,392
So now

762
00:35:39,648 --> 00:35:40,160
Yes

763
00:35:40,672 --> 00:35:41,184
There's more

764
00:35:41,696 --> 00:35:42,208
WhatsApp

765
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:46,304
For now

766
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:49,120
Tom Horn

767
00:35:49,632 --> 00:35:50,656
And Chris Putnam

768
00:35:51,168 --> 00:35:52,448
That sounds like a class

769
00:35:53,216 --> 00:35:55,264
It is one of the great Tales of History

770
00:35:55,776 --> 00:35:56,800
For the great love stories

771
00:35:58,336 --> 00:36:01,408
Not since he's old and Tristan

772
00:36:04,992 --> 00:36:05,760
Star-crossed lovers

773
00:36:06,016 --> 00:36:07,808
I only know about that is old

774
00:36:08,064 --> 00:36:09,600
Tristan because of like

775
00:36:09,856 --> 00:36:12,160
I worked at a movie theater when that movie came out

776
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:17,536
And all I remember was all of the marketing materials

777
00:36:18,048 --> 00:36:20,352
So petty about Romeo and Juliet

778
00:36:22,144 --> 00:36:25,472
I remember to the Daily

779
00:36:32,384 --> 00:36:38,272
Even the movie

780
00:36:38,528 --> 00:36:43,648
That was part of the marketing

781
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:46,720
Not alike

782
00:36:46,976 --> 00:36:49,280
20 years ago probably be working at that movie theater

783
00:36:49,792 --> 00:36:51,072
Maybe a little less

784
00:36:51,328 --> 00:36:53,120
Genuinely do not know why I know any

785
00:36:53,632 --> 00:36:54,144
Tristan

786
00:36:54,656 --> 00:37:00,800
Other than I was in a dumpster

787
00:37:01,056 --> 00:37:01,568
Became a reference

788
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:03,104
So

789
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:06,432
Little bit of the story of the beginning of

790
00:37:06,688 --> 00:37:07,200
Conspiracy

791
00:37:07,456 --> 00:37:10,272
Your eyes and I'll fill in the blanks

792
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:11,040
Cuz best I can

793
00:37:11,296 --> 00:37:17,184
Is there some kids today

794
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:20,512
John Cusack

795
00:37:21,536 --> 00:37:22,560
Perhaps

796
00:37:22,816 --> 00:37:24,608
Also I should say Tom Horn

797
00:37:24,864 --> 00:37:26,912
Wrote Love in the Time of Cholera

798
00:37:27,936 --> 00:37:29,984
Thursday Supernatural

799
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:30,752

806
00:37:51,744 --> 00:37:52,256
I was

807
00:37:53,024 --> 00:37:54,048
Writing down

808
00:37:55,328 --> 00:37:56,096
When you were

809
00:37:56,352 --> 00:37:57,376
Going to meet

810
00:37:58,912 --> 00:38:00,960
Adductor Moe's I believe his

811
00:38:01,472 --> 00:38:02,752
Was that correct

812
00:38:05,056 --> 00:38:05,568
What was the

813
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:09,152
Medical doctor or

814
00:38:09,664 --> 00:38:11,200

Cancel

818
00:38:20,416 --> 00:38:21,440
You know the whole

819
00:38:25,792 --> 00:38:29,888
Down from

820
00:38:30,144 --> 00:38:31,424
The world

821
00:38:36,288 --> 00:38:38,336
Is this called Lucifer

822
00:38:39,616 --> 00:38:41,920
Good morning

823
00:38:42,176 --> 00:38:45,760
Technology inside the large

824
00:38:46,016 --> 00:38:47,296
Just called the Lucifer

825
00:38:47,808 --> 00:38:50,624
So well that that makes everything clear Dan

826
00:38:51,136 --> 00:38:52,928
A big

827
00:38:53,184 --> 00:38:54,208
Conspiracy

828
00:38:56,512 --> 00:38:57,024
Propagate

829
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:59,328
By Tom Horn

830
00:38:59,584 --> 00:39:04,960
Just because you guys are the ones who were popularized

831
00:39:05,216 --> 00:39:09,056
You could say that there were other players involved too but their major figures

832
00:39:09,312 --> 00:39:15,456
The Vatican having a Lucifer telescope

833
00:39:16,224 --> 00:39:17,248
But a lot of

834
00:39:17,504 --> 00:39:19,040
Conspiracy around it was that

835
00:39:19,296 --> 00:39:20,064
The

836
00:39:20,576 --> 00:39:22,112
The vacuum is in touch with alien

837
00:39:22,624 --> 00:39:26,464
And they're using Lucifer telescope in order to

838
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:27,744
Track Nibiru

839
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:34,144
Or Planet X okay back around in 2012 at the end of the Mayan calendar

840
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,704
Of course

841
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:43,872
So if you leave that piece off of it and that's why I believe Tom Warren is like

842
00:39:44,384 --> 00:39:45,152
The technology

843
00:39:45,408 --> 00:39:46,176
Birthing chair

844
00:39:46,432 --> 00:39:48,992
So anytime somebody is like

845
00:39:49,248 --> 00:39:51,296
Let's throw in something that some assholes

846
00:39:52,064 --> 00:39:53,856
People do need to get better at naming

847
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:59,488
Why you would name it Lucifer but if you need me poop

848
00:39:59,744 --> 00:40:00,768
Give no idea why

849
00:40:01,024 --> 00:40:03,584
What it was

850
00:40:13,312 --> 00:40:13,824
Place

851
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:17,408
There are multiple

852
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:19,968
Zerva Tori's multiple

853
00:40:20,224 --> 00:40:21,504
Unrelated

854
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:22,272
Empathy

855
00:40:22,784 --> 00:40:23,808
On my G

856
00:40:28,672 --> 00:40:30,976
Include the Gregorian telescope

857
00:40:31,232 --> 00:40:32,768
Yandy Thomas

858
00:40:33,024 --> 00:40:35,584
Astrophysics facility

859
00:40:36,608 --> 00:40:38,656
Where's said telescope

860
00:40:38,912 --> 00:40:40,448
His house is the Alice

861
00:40:40,704 --> 00:40:42,752
Thomas

862
00:40:44,288 --> 00:40:46,336
This is commonly referred to as the

863
00:40:46,592 --> 00:40:47,360
Complex

864
00:40:48,128 --> 00:40:54,272
Also on Mount Graham but I'm connected to that is the Mount Graham International Observatory which contains the large

865
00:40:54,528 --> 00:40:55,296
Binocular telescope

866
00:40:55,808 --> 00:40:57,856
Part of a technology mgio

867
00:40:58,112 --> 00:40:59,136
Is an infrared spec

868
00:40:59,392 --> 00:41:02,976
Spectroscopy module known as

869
00:41:03,232 --> 00:41:07,328
Binocular telescope near-infrared spectrasonic utility with

870
00:41:07,584 --> 00:41:10,400
Cameron intrical field unit for extra-galactic research

871
00:41:10,912 --> 00:41:13,984
Initially the acronym for this was Lucifer but since Chris

872
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:16,800
Those kept been weird about it they changed it

873
00:41:17,312 --> 00:41:17,824
Because

874
00:41:18,336 --> 00:41:24,480
You take out some of the let him if there's no way that's going to make a word couple of the word acronym you end up with

875
00:41:24,736 --> 00:41:26,016
Lucifer if you were some sort of

876
00:41:26,272 --> 00:41:28,320
Ugnaught Vatican connected

877
00:41:28,576 --> 00:41:32,672
Astrologist

878
00:41:32,928 --> 00:41:37,280
Yep in the same way that that Blue Horse Outside the Denver Airport that giant blue horse

879
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:38,304
Valdosta

880
00:41:39,328 --> 00:41:45,472
Lucifer the artist

881
00:41:46,496 --> 00:41:47,008
Lifan

882
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:48,032
His dad only

883
00:41:48,288 --> 00:41:49,568
Indian shop when he was a kid

884
00:41:49,824 --> 00:41:51,360
So we decorated with some neon eyes

885
00:41:51,616 --> 00:41:53,151
Isn't omage to his father

886
00:41:53,407 --> 00:41:56,991
All this s*** anyway

887
00:41:57,247 --> 00:42:00,063
Assuming that the pope has sanctioned

888
00:42:00,575 --> 00:42:01,599
Telescope

889
00:42:01,855 --> 00:42:03,647
Called Lucifer in the middle

890
00:42:03,903 --> 00:42:05,183
Mount Graham

891
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:09,535
Yeah where is it

892
00:42:13,887 --> 00:42:16,191
Seems like a lot of people are communicating with aliens

893
00:42:16,703 --> 00:42:21,311
Seems like we're the only ones who aren't the only ones we have

894
00:42:22,335 --> 00:42:24,383
We really should get one just like a small one

895
00:42:24,639 --> 00:42:26,175
Lakewood

896
00:42:26,431 --> 00:42:28,223
Put it on a mount

897
00:42:28,479 --> 00:42:30,783
Damn sure

898
00:42:31,039 --> 00:42:32,831
There's a Danville in almost every

899
00:42:33,087 --> 00:42:34,111
There's a little time

900
00:42:34,367 --> 00:42:36,415
Hill in Danville

901
00:42:37,439 --> 00:42:38,207
Good

902
00:42:38,463 --> 00:42:39,743
Knowledge fight Memorial

903
00:42:39,999 --> 00:42:41,535
Mount Dan telescope

904
00:42:43,327 --> 00:42:44,607
We're going to get to the Native American

905
00:42:44,863 --> 00:42:45,631
Himself a little bit later

906
00:42:45,887 --> 00:42:52,031
He's going to bring that back up and Native American Medicine Man if we're all about

907
00:42:52,287 --> 00:42:57,407
Endomorph full wave before I get in

908
00:42:57,663 --> 00:42:59,199
Into the more the stuff here about this

909
00:42:59,711 --> 00:43:01,503
Telescope

910
00:43:01,759 --> 00:43:03,807
Most of his ideas

911
00:43:04,063 --> 00:43:05,087
About

912
00:43:05,343 --> 00:43:05,855
B b

913
00:43:06,367 --> 00:43:08,159
Connection with UFOs

914
00:43:08,671 --> 00:43:10,975
Is based on the guy named guy

915
00:43:11,487 --> 00:43:14,303
Console.log know who

916
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:19,935
Is he was a past president of the iau commission on planets and moons

917
00:43:20,191 --> 00:43:22,239
Have an affiliation with Nevada

918
00:43:23,775 --> 00:43:24,799
So he had an interview with me

919
00:43:26,335 --> 00:43:26,847
A little bit

920
00:43:27,871 --> 00:43:28,639
After

921
00:43:28,895 --> 00:43:29,407
Tom Horn

922
00:43:29,663 --> 00:43:30,687
Started putting out a bunch of in

923
00:43:30,943 --> 00:43:31,967
Information about

924
00:43:32,223 --> 00:43:35,039
Interviews with this consolmagno guy

925
00:43:38,879 --> 00:43:39,647
With this statement

926
00:43:40,671 --> 00:43:43,487
About a year ago and author who am I will not name or link

927
00:43:43,743 --> 00:43:46,047
You conducted an extensive interview with me by email

928
00:43:46,303 --> 00:43:47,839
I thought he was a legitimate journalist

929
00:43:48,351 --> 00:43:50,911
However seeing the ways in which is Twisted misquoted invent

930
00:43:51,167 --> 00:43:52,191
Falsehoods from

931
00:43:52,447 --> 00:43:55,519
Some things I said I've come to speculate either a knave or fool

932
00:43:55,775 --> 00:43:56,543
There are no Vatican

933
00:43:56,799 --> 00:43:57,823
Secrets about UFOs

934
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:01,407
Neither I nor anyone I know his any evidence of extraterrestrials exist

935
00:44:01,919 --> 00:44:06,015
We do not believe that Jesus is a hybrid or any of the other bizarre claims this author makes

936
00:44:06,271 --> 00:44:08,831
He is either seriously deluded or deliberate conman

937
00:44:09,343 --> 00:44:10,879
Let me rephrase this as strongly as I can

938
00:44:11,391 --> 00:44:12,415
I do not know of

939
00:44:12,671 --> 00:44:16,511
Any credible evidence at all that there is ever been contact of any for between

940
00:44:16,767 --> 00:44:17,791
Extraterrestrial aliens in

941
00:44:18,303 --> 00:44:21,375
. I cannot imagine a circumstance where such contact could be

942
00:44:21,631 --> 00:44:22,399
Kept secret for very long

943
00:44:22,911 --> 00:44:25,727
And I say this not only as an active astronomer for 40 years

944
00:44:25,983 --> 00:44:29,055
But also is someone who knows a lot of people in the city community

945
00:44:29,311 --> 00:44:29,823
Who would

946
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:31,103
Love to have such evidence

947
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:33,407
And as someone who's been an officer of the American

948
00:44:33,663 --> 00:44:37,503
Strama Astronomical Society and the international astronomical Union

949
00:44:38,015 --> 00:44:39,295
If there's something like this going on

950
00:44:39,551 --> 00:44:41,087
We'd all be talking about it

951
00:44:41,343 --> 00:44:41,855
There isn't

952
00:44:43,647 --> 00:44:45,183
They would pretty much be talking about it now.

953
00:44:45,439 --> 00:44:48,511
Stop it might be the only thing anyone would ever talk

954
00:44:49,023 --> 00:44:53,887
People to be like

955
00:44:54,143 --> 00:44:56,703
What would we talk about aliens again f*** off

956
00:44:56,959 --> 00:44:59,775
Yes sir he is a completely misrepresent

957
00:45:00,287 --> 00:45:03,359
Interview

958
00:45:03,615 --> 00:45:04,895
Which I bring up parsley because

959
00:45:05,151 --> 00:45:06,943
Mostly because

960
00:45:07,455 --> 00:45:09,247
It is the sort of behavior that these be

961
00:45:09,503 --> 00:45:10,783
People to take

962
00:45:11,039 --> 00:45:12,319
Entirely out of context

963
00:45:12,831 --> 00:45:13,855
Make stuff up

964
00:45:14,111 --> 00:45:15,903
You can roll the bones and no one will know.

965
00:45:16,159 --> 00:45:18,207
Hope they never find out hope no one looks at

966
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:22,815
Also there aren't a lot of good opportunities to use the word knave properly

967
00:45:23,327 --> 00:45:23,839
That's a

968
00:45:24,095 --> 00:45:26,399
Fun word to toss around and that is the

969
00:45:26,655 --> 00:45:31,007
Most accurate where that guy could have used it's almost like he chooses his words

970
00:45:31,263 --> 00:45:33,567
And decides to use them when they are

971
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:36,383
Also it's fun because when they talk about going

972
00:45:36,639 --> 00:45:37,663
Mount Graham

973
00:45:38,431 --> 00:45:43,551
I believe there'll be some of this in the episode as we go along but they broke

974
00:45:43,807 --> 00:45:45,599
Or like it was some sort of a like

975
00:45:47,647 --> 00:45:50,975
Ballsy investigative

976
00:45:51,231 --> 00:45:54,559
Project Veritas infiltration

977
00:45:54,815 --> 00:45:55,583
Triumph

978
00:45:55,839 --> 00:45:57,119
Presented as like

979
00:45:57,375 --> 00:45:57,887
A dramatic

980
00:45:59,167 --> 00:46:00,703
Active sort of thing

981
00:46:03,263 --> 00:46:05,823
You can take a tour like it's open to the public

982
00:46:06,335 --> 00:46:06,847
Like it's not

983
00:46:07,103 --> 00:46:10,687
If you called and you presented yourself as a journalist

984
00:46:10,943 --> 00:46:11,711
You could probably interview any

985
00:46:11,967 --> 00:46:18,111
Anybody there

986
00:46:19,903 --> 00:46:22,719
You can go to work buddy we're not close

987
00:46:22,975 --> 00:46:24,255
Oh okay but

988
00:46:26,815 --> 00:46:28,351
Create this sort of miso surround

989
00:46:28,863 --> 00:46:30,399
What day did like going

990
00:46:30,655 --> 00:46:35,007
To my gram was dangerous for that

991
00:46:35,263 --> 00:46:35,775
The Native Americans

992
00:46:37,311 --> 00:46:38,847
All of it is horseshit

993
00:46:40,127 --> 00:46:41,151
Play all of it is just

994
00:46:41,407 --> 00:46:43,711
Classic

995
00:46:44,479 --> 00:46:50,623
They are selling you on a

996
00:46:50,879 --> 00:46:52,927
Otherwise like

997
00:46:53,695 --> 00:46:55,231
We've all been on

998
00:46:55,743 --> 00:46:57,791
Just tell it as

999
00:46:58,047 --> 00:46:59,327
It's an investigation in

1000
00:46:59,583 --> 00:47:01,375
We figured it all out because of

1001
00:47:03,679 --> 00:47:04,703
Himself in the face and take a pic

1002
00:47:04,959 --> 00:47:05,471
Picture while he's on vacation

1003
00:47:05,727 --> 00:47:09,055
Oh yeah

1004
00:47:09,311 --> 00:47:12,383
Right on your trip but the trip wasn't it

1005
00:47:12,639 --> 00:47:13,919
Good story

1006
00:47:14,175 --> 00:47:17,503
How good of a story is they let us in and were very gracious and talk to us

1007
00:47:17,759 --> 00:47:19,551
You got to have punch up on every

1008
00:47:20,063 --> 00:47:21,087
Reality is kind

1009
00:47:21,855 --> 00:47:25,951
I told you that we're going to get to the Native Americans

1010
00:47:26,207 --> 00:47:26,975
Sooner than I expect

1011
00:47:28,511 --> 00:47:29,279
Still just

1012
00:47:29,791 --> 00:47:31,327
Let It Go all of the ship

1013
00:47:31,583 --> 00:47:34,143
They said so far as not being that far off the

1014
00:47:36,191 --> 00:47:36,703
Because

1015
00:47:36,959 --> 00:47:38,751
This is going to get further off the rail

1016
00:47:39,007 --> 00:47:39,519
A hundred percent

1017
00:47:41,823 --> 00:47:47,967
It goes off the rails in multiple directions Tower of Babel is about them

1018
00:47:48,223 --> 00:47:50,527
Being capable of getting all the way up to God

1019
00:47:50,783 --> 00:47:56,927
Write the character of God

1020
00:47:57,183 --> 00:47:59,231
Alternate portal

1021
00:47:59,487 --> 00:48:03,327
So far so good

1022
00:48:04,095 --> 00:48:04,863
What are we doing here

1023
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:06,911
What are we doing

1024
00:48:07,167 --> 00:48:10,239
I the best I can tell you is that goes along

1025
00:48:11,007 --> 00:48:12,799
It's not like the train goes off the rails

1026
00:48:13,311 --> 00:48:19,455
It's like little cars break off of the train and go off the rails directions

1027
00:48:19,711 --> 00:48:22,527
And your sword is still tracking those trains as

1028
00:48:22,783 --> 00:48:25,087
Some of them explode

1029
00:48:25,343 --> 00:48:30,719
Sure here is where we get into the sooner the beginnings of what you want to talk about about Native Americans

1030
00:48:33,279 --> 00:48:37,887
We think walk a week we solve the mystery writer what's going on

1031
00:48:38,143 --> 00:48:39,167
You talk about after he got it too

1032
00:48:40,191 --> 00:48:40,959
And then

1033
00:48:45,823 --> 00:48:51,967
Who wants the radio

1034
00:48:54,271 --> 00:48:56,063
And he says the reason that the Apache

1035
00:48:56,575 --> 00:48:57,855
Join the environment

1036
00:49:03,999 --> 00:49:04,767
It's because

1037
00:49:05,023 --> 00:49:07,583
Graham is one of the four holiest mountains

1038
00:49:08,095 --> 00:49:08,863
In the world

1039
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:10,399
American Inn

1040
00:49:12,191 --> 00:49:12,959
And it is

1041
00:49:13,215 --> 00:49:14,751
Because

1042
00:49:15,007 --> 00:49:15,775
It is a portal

1043
00:49:16,287 --> 00:49:17,311
It is a doorway

1044
00:49:17,567 --> 00:49:18,847
It is a gateway

1045
00:49:20,127 --> 00:49:22,687
Location on Earth

1046
00:49:22,943 --> 00:49:23,455
The beginning

1047
00:49:27,039 --> 00:49:29,087
Of this reality

1048
00:49:29,343 --> 00:49:32,159
We went through

1049
00:49:32,927 --> 00:49:38,047
Amboy the conspiracy light went off and our head about now why

1050
00:49:39,071 --> 00:49:41,119
I would like more information on this vetting process

1051
00:49:41,375 --> 00:49:42,143
How do you

1052
00:49:42,911 --> 00:49:44,703
This is a portal that

1053
00:49:44,959 --> 00:49:46,495
Many people have many ant

1054
00:49:47,519 --> 00:49:49,311
Entered in and out of over

1055
00:49:49,567 --> 00:49:50,079
Humanism

1056
00:49:50,335 --> 00:49:51,871
The only response

1057
00:49:52,127 --> 00:49:57,247
I looked into it and I'm very sad to report the top horn has not been on Project Camelot

1058
00:49:57,503 --> 00:50:03,647
Doctors that belongs on f****** truck I was just thinking about what happens when you combine

1059
00:50:03,903 --> 00:50:07,231
Who believe in God with people who are willing to lie about science and then

1060
00:50:07,487 --> 00:50:09,023
Throw God in there

1061
00:50:09,279 --> 00:50:13,119
Like beneath the surface a little bit carry is probably a little religious

1062
00:50:13,375 --> 00:50:15,935
Elaine's a little religion

1063
00:50:20,543 --> 00:50:21,311
Generally speaking

1064
00:50:21,823 --> 00:50:22,591
Not always

1065
00:50:22,847 --> 00:50:23,359
But

1066
00:50:23,615 --> 00:50:24,127
Usually

1067
00:50:24,383 --> 00:50:25,151
Responsible

1068
00:50:25,919 --> 00:50:26,687
And so they don't

1069
00:50:27,199 --> 00:50:28,223
6 Acres like

1070
00:50:28,991 --> 00:50:35,135
We're trying to provide

1071
00:50:35,391 --> 00:50:38,463
Apache are the protectors

1072
00:50:38,719 --> 00:50:42,047
There's a certain bit of like old-school like 19

1073
00:50:42,303 --> 00:50:43,327
Forties adventurism

1074
00:50:49,983 --> 00:50:56,127
Observatory

1075
00:50:56,383 --> 00:51:00,223
Armetta's Pizza

1076
00:51:00,479 --> 00:51:01,503
There's the whole thing

1077
00:51:01,759 --> 00:51:06,367
Go backwards

1078
00:51:06,879 --> 00:51:11,487
But the same religious nevermind

1079
00:51:15,071 --> 00:51:16,863
This is a 1940s Boys in French

1080
00:51:20,447 --> 00:51:23,263
The reason I can't respond to that clip really

1081
00:51:23,775 --> 00:51:25,311
Is because I don't know his writing process

1082
00:51:26,335 --> 00:51:31,711
And I can't get that information pretty sure he threw a rock through the portal that information

1083
00:51:34,015 --> 00:51:36,063
But I can bet other things he says

1084
00:51:36,319 --> 00:51:37,087
And I can use that is

1085
00:51:37,343 --> 00:51:39,647
Context clues about whether or not I should trust him

1086
00:51:39,903 --> 00:51:40,671
This next clip

1087
00:51:42,463 --> 00:51:44,255
And you lived in Arizona by the way

1088
00:51:44,511 --> 00:51:47,839
You know why they called The Phoenix metropolitan area

1089
00:51:48,095 --> 00:51:48,607
The Sun

1090
00:51:48,863 --> 00:51:55,007
It's because

1091
00:51:56,287 --> 00:51:57,311
And he said

1092
00:51:57,567 --> 00:52:03,711
Across the Earth

1093
00:52:08,319 --> 00:52:09,087
Very so

1094
00:52:10,111 --> 00:52:10,879
Headline

1095
00:52:11,135 --> 00:52:11,647
On that day

1096
00:52:12,159 --> 00:52:13,183
Giant killed by flood

1097
00:52:13,951 --> 00:52:14,975
How big were the Giants

1098
00:52:15,231 --> 00:52:18,559
Huge huge were they the New York Giants

1099
00:52:21,887 --> 00:52:22,399
Nephilim

1100
00:52:22,655 --> 00:52:23,935
Giants Nephilim

1101
00:52:25,215 --> 00:52:30,591
The Native Americans also believed in the Nephilim the Nephilim

1102
00:52:30,847 --> 00:52:31,359
Just

1103
00:52:32,895 --> 00:52:38,271
Believe in the Nephilim

1104
00:52:38,527 --> 00:52:39,039
And of course

1105
00:52:39,295 --> 00:52:41,087
This as we all should have now

1106
00:52:41,855 --> 00:52:42,879
Because of the very

1107
00:52:43,135 --> 00:52:43,903
Well-known concert

1108
00:52:44,159 --> 00:52:45,951
Everyone within a certain

1109
00:52:46,207 --> 00:52:46,719
Community knows

1110
00:52:47,999 --> 00:52:49,023
The Valley of the Sun

1111
00:52:49,279 --> 00:52:50,303
Bright

1112
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:52,863
Cuz Giants got flood

1113
00:52:53,119 --> 00:52:59,007
Giant

1114
00:52:59,263 --> 00:53:04,895
So they pray the god of the sun

1115
00:53:05,407 --> 00:53:06,431
Mysteriously didn't kill them in the

1116
00:53:06,687 --> 00:53:07,199
McCabe's

1117
00:53:07,967 --> 00:53:10,015
Seems like a trap during a flood

1118
00:53:15,391 --> 00:53:15,903
Furthermore

1119
00:53:16,927 --> 00:53:17,695
Is this

1120
00:53:17,951 --> 00:53:19,231
Did this guy think that

1121
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:24,095
Believe that that did happen

1122
00:53:26,399 --> 00:53:27,935
In line for Carmen

1123
00:53:28,191 --> 00:53:29,983
It's like you never really ate you know

1124
00:53:30,239 --> 00:53:31,519
Like a good poker player

1125
00:53:31,775 --> 00:53:33,823
You're not really sure if they're bluffing or not right

1126
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:36,639
Good con man or people who could doing it for long enough you

1127
00:53:36,895 --> 00:53:40,991
You don't know if they really believe it or if it's just a bluff

1128
00:53:41,247 --> 00:53:42,783
Within his Twisted world

1129
00:53:43,039 --> 00:53:44,575
Bright

1130
00:53:45,087 --> 00:53:47,903
Because of a literal events that happened

1131
00:53:49,183 --> 00:53:54,303
Raw

1132
00:53:55,071 --> 00:53:57,119
The Jehovah

1133
00:53:57,375 --> 00:54:03,263
Bravo's

1134
00:54:03,775 --> 00:54:05,055
Why did they get the flood

1135
00:54:05,311 --> 00:54:09,151
If they're okay cuz they just think of it serious

1136
00:54:09,407 --> 00:54:10,687
It's all one God many names

1137
00:54:10,943 --> 00:54:13,503
He is busy is the god of the sun and

1138
00:54:13,759 --> 00:54:14,527
I'm telling you something

1139
00:54:15,039 --> 00:54:20,159
Ain't no son like the Son of God you know I'm saying unfortunately I'm in Arizona Central

1140
00:54:20,415 --> 00:54:22,207
Azcentral.com

1141
00:54:22,719 --> 00:54:24,511
It's critical for cities to be properly marked

1142
00:54:25,023 --> 00:54:29,375
Create a sense of place for residents and alluring vacation destination for tourist

1143
00:54:30,911 --> 00:54:32,959
Roosters coded Phoenix

1144
00:54:34,239 --> 00:54:39,615
Boosters touted Phoenix as being the quote Denver of the Southwest and the 1890s

1145
00:54:40,895 --> 00:54:41,919
Unimaginative

1146
00:54:42,175 --> 00:54:44,991
In the 1920s they try quote wear summer

1147
00:54:45,247 --> 00:54:46,527
I swear summer Winters

1148
00:54:48,063 --> 00:54:49,855
Spot of America the Beaufort.

1149
00:54:50,367 --> 00:54:55,487
In 1935 the Valley of the Sun slogan was coined by a local advertising agency for the

1150
00:54:55,743 --> 00:54:56,511
Commerce

1151
00:54:56,767 --> 00:55:01,119
The group felt the slogan had a quote directory to repeal the cannot help but attract entry

1152
00:55:01,631 --> 00:55:02,399
According to

1153
00:55:02,655 --> 00:55:04,447
1835 Arizona Republic article

1154
00:55:04,959 --> 00:55:08,799
Cooked up by the Phoenix Metro area

1155
00:55:09,055 --> 00:55:09,823
In the 1930s

1156
00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:13,151
Because it sounded better than the accurate name the Salt River Valley

1157
00:55:13,663 --> 00:55:19,295
The reason for the name is at the Metropolitan Area will be one of the sunniest places in the country receiving an average of

1158
00:55:19,551 --> 00:55:21,599
295 days of sunlight a year

1159
00:55:21,855 --> 00:55:23,903
As opposed to the national average of 205

1160
00:55:24,671 --> 00:55:29,023
This does not come from Native American comes from 1930s Arizona tourism board

1161
00:55:29,279 --> 00:55:31,071
I am a big fan

1162
00:55:31,327 --> 00:55:34,655
Looking into it

1163
00:55:34,911 --> 00:55:35,423
At all

1164
00:55:35,935 --> 00:55:42,079
Congratulations on your study of anytime that kind

1165
00:55:42,335 --> 00:55:43,103
How to claim comes out

1166
00:55:43,359 --> 00:55:45,151
On our show and then you just

1167
00:55:45,407 --> 00:55:46,431
Immediately point to

1168
00:55:46,943 --> 00:55:49,759
This was Market

1169
00:55:50,015 --> 00:55:54,367
This is an addict also speaks

1170
00:55:57,439 --> 00:56:00,511
Is that also years later

1171
00:56:01,023 --> 00:56:01,791
Now probably

1172
00:56:02,815 --> 00:56:05,631
So you just got to tell Tom Horn something he wants to hear

1173
00:56:05,887 --> 00:56:06,399
And he will be true

1174
00:56:06,655 --> 00:56:07,679
So

1175
00:56:07,935 --> 00:56:08,959
Like I'm saying

1176
00:56:09,471 --> 00:56:10,751
Their claims you convey

1177
00:56:11,007 --> 00:56:11,775
And there's claims that you

1178
00:56:12,799 --> 00:56:15,359
The fact that prove or disprove that

1179
00:56:15,615 --> 00:56:16,383
The Giants were flooded

1180
00:56:16,639 --> 00:56:17,919
Boosie I can't

1181
00:56:18,175 --> 00:56:18,943
But I don't care

1182
00:56:19,455 --> 00:56:23,551
Because I can prove that he doesn't know that I was a tourist slogan right from the

1183
00:56:23,807 --> 00:56:26,367
Agency came up with

1184
00:56:26,623 --> 00:56:27,903
Not something that is

1185
00:56:28,159 --> 00:56:29,695
Really indicative of

1186
00:56:29,951 --> 00:56:31,999
Navajo Legends

1187
00:56:32,255 --> 00:56:33,023
Parallel thinking

1188
00:56:33,279 --> 00:56:36,351
ABS parallel to the Navajo came up with it first

1189
00:56:36,607 --> 00:56:37,119
And then

1190
00:56:37,631 --> 00:56:38,911
Hundreds of years later

1191
00:56:39,167 --> 00:56:44,031
That marketing guy he just got influenced by the sun god I recommend everybody to read

1192
00:56:44,287 --> 00:56:46,847
As many articles as I have today

1193
00:56:47,103 --> 00:56:49,919
About why is Phoenix called the Valley of the Sun

1194
00:56:50,175 --> 00:56:53,247
All of them will point you in the exact same direction

1195
00:56:53,503 --> 00:56:56,831
Has nothing to do this son God flooded him

1196
00:56:57,855 --> 00:56:58,367
Ideas

1197
00:56:58,879 --> 00:56:59,647
And that's what

1198
00:57:00,159 --> 00:57:02,207
That's why it's called the Valley of the Sun

1199
00:57:02,463 --> 00:57:06,047
Emmett clip before this where Tom was talking hot bulshit

1200
00:57:06,559 --> 00:57:07,839
You said you talked

1201
00:57:08,095 --> 00:57:08,607
Navajo

1202
00:57:09,119 --> 00:57:10,655
Perhaps

1203
00:57:10,911 --> 00:57:12,703
The Medicine Man by dr. Mays

1204
00:57:13,215 --> 00:57:14,239
He was Apache

1205
00:57:15,007 --> 00:57:16,799
No he's very fast and loose about these

1206
00:57:21,407 --> 00:57:22,431
Freshly.com

1207
00:57:23,967 --> 00:57:25,247
Who's we

1208
00:57:25,503 --> 00:57:29,343
What is that only come up on Jim Bakker Show by the way

1209
00:57:29,599 --> 00:57:31,903
Specific racism

1210
00:57:32,415 --> 00:57:33,183
Maybe it's not even race

1211
00:57:34,975 --> 00:57:35,487
Ignorance

1212
00:57:35,743 --> 00:57:36,511
Yeah

1213
00:57:36,767 --> 00:57:37,791
Wilfred

1214
00:57:38,047 --> 00:57:39,071
Seems very consistent

1215
00:57:39,327 --> 00:57:40,351
And actually I actually

1216
00:57:40,863 --> 00:57:43,167
You know why it's because the Tom Horn

1217
00:57:43,423 --> 00:57:44,191
Steve Quayle are good

1218
00:57:44,959 --> 00:57:47,519
There's contemporary

1219
00:57:47,775 --> 00:57:53,663
And know each other and do each other's radio shows all the time

1220
00:57:54,175 --> 00:57:55,199
About Anasazi

1221
00:57:55,455 --> 00:57:55,967
People

1222
00:57:56,991 --> 00:57:57,503
Yeah absolutely

1223
00:57:57,759 --> 00:58:00,831
More from this Navajo gentle

1224
00:58:02,111 --> 00:58:02,623
Talk to

1225
00:58:03,647 --> 00:58:04,159
I'll tell you what

1226
00:58:04,927 --> 00:58:07,487
I have a very simple explanation for this

1227
00:58:09,535 --> 00:58:11,839
Fishes going down the storyline

1228
00:58:21,311 --> 00:58:24,639
There's a lot of evidence

1229
00:58:24,895 --> 00:58:27,199
Princeton

1230
00:58:27,455 --> 00:58:33,599
Everything behind all the tools everything was still inside the case

1231
00:58:37,183 --> 00:58:37,951
And he says

1232
00:58:38,207 --> 00:58:39,487
Well I should not tell you

1233
00:58:41,535 --> 00:58:44,863
And then he starts saying if you would have asked my great-grandfather

1234
00:58:45,375 --> 00:58:47,679
Here's the story

1235
00:58:47,935 --> 00:58:51,775
And he describes a portal in the four corners area

1236
00:58:56,895 --> 00:58:59,967
Comes through over there

1237
00:59:00,223 --> 00:59:04,575
Years before Jesus Christ walked on the Earth

1238
00:59:04,831 --> 00:59:07,391
Portal of spiral vortex

1239
00:59:07,647 --> 00:59:08,671
Support

1240
00:59:08,927 --> 00:59:12,511
Giant halo around

1241
00:59:16,095 --> 00:59:17,375
Teaching the Anasazi

1242
00:59:17,631 --> 00:59:20,959
Historian

1243
00:59:21,215 --> 00:59:21,983
He starts

1244
00:59:22,239 --> 00:59:24,031
He starts teaching the

1245
00:59:26,079 --> 00:59:26,847
Dark magic

1246
00:59:28,127 --> 00:59:30,943
An underground place

1247
00:59:31,199 --> 00:59:32,223
Holy places

1248
00:59:32,735 --> 00:59:35,295
New Testament

1249
00:59:35,551 --> 00:59:36,575
Would call if they start using

1250
00:59:39,135 --> 00:59:42,463
And they're getting contact with these things and they bring them

1251
00:59:42,719 --> 00:59:46,815
Giants in the NFL

1252
00:59:48,095 --> 00:59:48,607
So

1253
00:59:49,119 --> 00:59:49,631
That's a lot

1254
00:59:50,911 --> 00:59:52,959
I can actually explain that in one sentence

1255
00:59:53,215 --> 00:59:55,775
I should probably save before you go off on

1256
00:59:57,311 --> 01:00:00,895
The reason that this Navajo guys grandfather would say this

1257
01:00:01,407 --> 01:00:03,711
About the people who he's referring to is Anasazi

1258
01:00:04,223 --> 01:00:06,783
Because if we recall what we talked about on that Steve Quayle at

1259
01:00:07,039 --> 01:00:08,319
Anasazi

1260
01:00:08,575 --> 01:00:10,367
Means literally a Navajo language

1261
01:00:10,623 --> 01:00:16,767
I have some sort of cultural tradition about demonizing on

1262
01:00:23,167 --> 01:00:24,191
Jimmy's dress

1263
01:00:24,703 --> 01:00:26,239
Sort of an Artful

1264
01:00:26,495 --> 01:00:27,519
Fold

1265
01:00:28,287 --> 01:00:32,383
Etiology of not like these

1266
01:00:32,639 --> 01:00:36,479
Right call them ancestral enemy

1267
01:00:36,735 --> 01:00:37,503
No not

1268
01:00:37,759 --> 01:00:38,271
Just that

1269
01:00:38,527 --> 01:00:40,063
It's because when that portal open

1270
01:00:40,319 --> 01:00:42,623
A demon reptilian beings came through

1271
01:00:42,879 --> 01:00:45,183
They were susceptible to the black magic

1272
01:00:45,439 --> 01:00:48,511
And that's why even though we probably should all just get along and

1273
01:00:48,767 --> 01:00:49,535
Live out our common

1274
01:00:49,791 --> 01:00:50,559
Purposes

1275
01:00:50,815 --> 01:00:55,679
I'm good no they are the author there the other and we don't trust them

1276
01:00:55,935 --> 01:00:57,983
What you doing it's being f******

1277
01:00:58,495 --> 01:00:59,007
Credibly

1278
01:00:59,263 --> 01:01:03,615
Stupid cultural context into it at all

1279
01:01:03,871 --> 01:01:05,663
If I heard like

1280
01:01:08,223 --> 01:01:08,735
I do

1281
01:01:09,503 --> 01:01:10,271
What I don't

1282
01:01:11,039 --> 01:01:11,551
Is

1283
01:01:11,807 --> 01:01:13,343
Why is everyone listening

1284
01:01:13,599 --> 01:01:14,367
And nodding

1285
01:01:15,391 --> 01:01:17,183
You mean the people at morning 2

1286
01:01:17,439 --> 01:01:18,207
It's weird

1287
01:01:19,999 --> 01:01:22,815
Doesn't this fly in the face of all of their beliefs

1288
01:01:23,583 --> 01:01:24,863
Like

1289
01:01:25,119 --> 01:01:26,143
If that's true

1290
01:01:26,399 --> 01:01:27,935
No no no

1291
01:01:28,191 --> 01:01:34,335
They're not as though this was a thing that cuz he emphasizes that this is what the

1292
01:01:34,591 --> 01:01:35,103
Navajo

1293
01:01:35,359 --> 01:01:39,199
Historian says to have brakes

1294
01:01:39,455 --> 01:01:45,599
He's also insisting that portals are real other real so he's now suggesting that a thousand years before

1295
01:01:45,855 --> 01:01:46,623
Jesus Christ

1296
01:01:46,879 --> 01:01:51,999
Navajo sorcerer Navajo

1297
01:01:52,255 --> 01:01:54,303
Who has the capability to open portals

1298
01:01:54,559 --> 01:01:56,095
Bring giant Sandra

1299
01:01:56,351 --> 01:01:59,423
Killian guys with halos

1300
01:01:59,679 --> 01:02:01,471
Everybody's Christian is just like

1301
01:02:01,727 --> 01:02:06,591
Wow I can't believe that happened is

1302
01:02:07,871 --> 01:02:12,991
They believe that Giants are in the Bible

1303
01:02:13,247 --> 01:02:18,367
Extra demonic beings or whatever.

1304
01:02:19,391 --> 01:02:20,927
I'm not sure he spells without fully

1305
01:02:21,695 --> 01:02:23,231
Sarasota blase

1306
01:02:23,487 --> 01:02:24,255
There's a service like

1307
01:02:24,511 --> 01:02:25,023
Whatever

1308
01:02:25,535 --> 01:02:27,327
Or whatever

1309
01:02:27,583 --> 01:02:31,935
Tom

1310
01:02:32,191 --> 01:02:34,239
He does bring this up a couple time

1311
01:02:34,495 --> 01:02:36,031
Angel just means messenger

1312
01:02:36,543 --> 01:02:38,079
I wouldn't have to be a race

1313
01:02:38,335 --> 01:02:39,103
Of being

1314
01:02:40,127 --> 01:02:42,431
Be all sorts of different messenger

1315
01:02:42,687 --> 01:02:44,735
Job not a typo

1316
01:02:44,991 --> 01:02:47,807
So

1317
01:02:48,063 --> 01:02:49,599
Christopher Lloyd

1318
01:02:59,071 --> 01:03:04,191
Let me tell you something

1319
01:03:08,031 --> 01:03:10,847
Is a remake

1320
01:03:11,103 --> 01:03:12,639
The best podcast ever

1321
01:03:14,687 --> 01:03:18,527
Messengers in the Outfield but not nearly as well

1322
01:03:23,135 --> 01:03:25,695
180

1323
01:03:25,951 --> 01:03:27,743
Good movies a year right

1324
01:03:29,023 --> 01:03:30,815
Baseball season

1325
01:03:32,095 --> 01:03:33,119
Guys

1326
01:03:34,399 --> 01:03:37,727
How do we move forward from

1327
01:03:37,983 --> 01:03:40,287
What's a good Angels in the Outfield B Gone it's

1328
01:03:40,543 --> 01:03:41,567
It's hard it's hard

1329
01:03:43,615 --> 01:03:44,895
He thinks that all that

1330
01:03:45,151 --> 01:03:46,943
Fits into his

1331
01:03:47,199 --> 01:03:48,735
Diversion of what

1332
01:03:48,991 --> 01:03:49,503
Christianity

1333
01:03:50,271 --> 01:03:51,039
And like what

1334
01:03:51,295 --> 01:03:52,575
The Bible

1335
01:03:56,671 --> 01:03:57,695
Sounds like

1336
01:03:58,207 --> 01:04:04,351
Distance learning history like that's the way that they

1337
01:04:04,607 --> 01:04:05,119
Is there like

1338
01:04:07,423 --> 01:04:08,447
Human history that

1339
01:04:08,703 --> 01:04:10,239
100% real that I do

1340
01:04:10,751 --> 01:04:15,615
No

1341
01:04:15,871 --> 01:04:16,895
What's going on here

1342
01:04:17,151 --> 01:04:17,919
Visit

1343
01:04:19,199 --> 01:04:20,735
You you pointed this out early

1344
01:04:22,271 --> 01:04:24,575
Worried that none of these people have ever actually read the

1345
01:04:27,647 --> 01:04:28,671
Nouveau

1346
01:04:28,927 --> 01:04:29,439
Translations of

1347
01:04:29,695 --> 01:04:31,231
The bible message version

1348
01:04:31,487 --> 01:04:33,791
The Bible and stuff like that that's one of those

1349
01:04:34,047 --> 01:04:37,119
Maybe after even both

1350
01:04:37,375 --> 01:04:37,887
Or X

1351
01:04:38,143 --> 01:04:39,679
When we were in the church

1352
01:04:40,959 --> 01:04:41,727
The translation that

1353
01:04:44,543 --> 01:04:47,103
And stuff like that so it loses a lot of the

1354
01:04:48,895 --> 01:04:50,431
Of the King James version

1355
01:04:50,687 --> 01:04:51,967
Or even the NIV version

1356
01:04:54,271 --> 01:04:55,039
You guys aren't

1357
01:04:57,599 --> 01:04:58,111
Adventure

1358
01:04:58,367 --> 01:05:00,415
Put sunglasses on

1359
01:05:01,951 --> 01:05:03,487
And even those versions

1360
01:05:03,743 --> 01:05:06,303
Like the classical version

1361
01:05:06,559 --> 01:05:07,583
Even have their problem

1362
01:05:09,631 --> 01:05:11,679
Classical Languages it all going

1363
01:05:11,935 --> 01:05:12,959
You know you start to have to

1364
01:05:13,215 --> 01:05:15,519
Look at is that

1365
01:05:15,775 --> 01:05:16,799
Like for instance

1366
01:05:17,311 --> 01:05:18,847
Usually ever right

1367
01:05:19,103 --> 01:05:19,615
Vowels

1368
01:05:20,127 --> 01:05:21,919
What's up like that

1369
01:05:22,175 --> 01:05:22,687
Between words

1370
01:05:26,527 --> 01:05:28,319
You know you suck it all out

1371
01:05:28,575 --> 01:05:31,391
Construction that you can make of

1372
01:05:32,927 --> 01:05:34,207
It's imprecise sometime

1373
01:05:34,719 --> 01:05:35,999
And that's Greek a language

1374
01:05:36,255 --> 01:05:37,791
We fucken understand almost fully

1375
01:05:38,047 --> 01:05:39,327
So when you take

1376
01:05:39,583 --> 01:05:42,911
These biblical texts that are from like koine Greek and you have

1377
01:05:43,167 --> 01:05:44,447
That level of detached

1378
01:05:44,703 --> 01:05:46,239
Turn from it

1379
01:05:46,495 --> 01:05:47,263
Like the other thing

1380
01:05:47,519 --> 01:05:50,079
Like so in college I translated The Iliad

1381
01:05:50,335 --> 01:05:50,847
And what am I

1382
01:05:53,151 --> 01:05:53,919
Translate Audelia

1383
01:05:54,175 --> 01:05:56,735
In my head

1384
01:05:56,991 --> 01:05:58,527
Like it's something that I think about

1385
01:05:58,783 --> 01:05:59,807
Very regularly

1386
01:06:00,063 --> 01:06:01,343
There are multiple words

1387
01:06:01,599 --> 01:06:02,111
In The Iliad

1388
01:06:02,367 --> 01:06:04,159
That don't exist anywhere else

1389
01:06:04,415 --> 01:06:05,439
Ever

1390
01:06:05,951 --> 01:06:09,279
Like there's one that is the only one I can remember is Polly Floyd

1391
01:06:10,303 --> 01:06:11,583
This word the only exist

1392
01:06:11,839 --> 01:06:12,607
One time

1393
01:06:12,863 --> 01:06:14,911
In The Iliad and never again in Greek

1394
01:06:15,167 --> 01:06:16,703
In no other Greek writing

1395
01:06:16,959 --> 01:06:17,983
It means many

1396
01:06:18,239 --> 01:06:18,751
Free flowing

1397
01:06:19,775 --> 01:06:21,055
The word that used to

1398
01:06:21,311 --> 01:06:22,335
To describe

1399
01:06:22,591 --> 01:06:26,175
Almost the sound of the water laughing up against the boat

1400
01:06:26,431 --> 01:06:29,759
And stuff like that description of a river

1401
01:06:34,367 --> 01:06:34,879
He's always struck

1402
01:06:35,135 --> 01:06:36,159
In my mind because

1403
01:06:37,183 --> 01:06:38,207
When you have these

1404
01:06:38,719 --> 01:06:40,767
Ancient languages and there are examples

1405
01:06:41,023 --> 01:06:42,815
These words that only exist

1406
01:06:43,071 --> 01:06:45,119
The one yeah there's a

1407
01:06:45,375 --> 01:06:45,887
Preciseness

1408
01:06:47,167 --> 01:06:47,679
Translation

1409
01:06:48,191 --> 01:06:49,727
And then on top of that if you've ever looked in

1410
01:06:50,495 --> 01:06:51,007
Scrolls

1411
01:06:51,263 --> 01:06:52,799
You would know that most of that is

1412
01:06:53,055 --> 01:06:53,567
Fragments

1413
01:06:53,823 --> 01:06:56,127
Yeah

1414
01:06:56,895 --> 01:06:59,967
Somewhat early people considered to be

1415
01:07:00,223 --> 01:07:01,759
Part part of a far larger series

1416
01:07:02,015 --> 01:07:05,343
Anyways I'm sorry for interrupting

1417
01:07:05,855 --> 01:07:07,391
Whatever it originally was it

1418
01:07:07,647 --> 01:07:11,231
What it was

1419
01:07:12,511 --> 01:07:13,791
Girls you know in

1420
01:07:14,303 --> 01:07:16,095
They found all those Scrolls at qumran

1421
01:07:18,143 --> 01:07:19,679
Tried to put them together as best

1422
01:07:22,751 --> 01:07:23,519
Scholarly texts

1423
01:07:23,775 --> 01:07:26,079
About the Dead Sea Scrolls you're going to have caveat

1424
01:07:30,943 --> 01:07:31,967
Little Liar books

1425
01:07:32,223 --> 01:07:33,503
In the Bible verse

1426
01:07:33,759 --> 01:07:36,063
Constructed and have been overtime right

1427
01:07:36,319 --> 01:07:37,855
So give it to me

1428
01:07:38,111 --> 01:07:38,879
When you have

1429
01:07:39,135 --> 01:07:40,927
That much you understand that much

1430
01:07:41,439 --> 01:07:43,231
You kind of have to accept salability in the

1431
01:07:44,255 --> 01:07:45,279
And then beyond

1432
01:07:45,535 --> 01:07:46,303
You have to

1433
01:07:46,815 --> 01:07:47,327
Really

1434
01:07:47,839 --> 01:07:48,351
Avoid

1435
01:07:49,887 --> 01:07:50,655
Cool translation

1436
01:07:51,167 --> 01:07:54,239
Because they're going to lead you into like a stupid world

1437
01:07:54,495 --> 01:07:57,823
Where you're like reading this God says hey bro what's up

1438
01:07:59,871 --> 01:08:01,151
But it's that sort of parallel

1439
01:08:01,407 --> 01:08:02,687
Like a God says what's going on

1440
01:08:03,455 --> 01:08:05,759
Yep you're going to lose pretty much everything

1441
01:08:06,015 --> 01:08:08,319
Spirit I guess

1442
01:08:08,575 --> 01:08:10,623
Maybe the intent of the text

1443
01:08:11,903 --> 01:08:17,023
Well in my world this very clear

1444
01:08:17,535 --> 01:08:19,327
The message version of the Bible

1445
01:08:21,375 --> 01:08:24,447
Jim Bakker episode we did was about to Paula White Cain

1446
01:08:31,871 --> 01:08:34,175
Find one we're talking about what

1447
01:08:34,431 --> 01:08:37,759
They ever read the Bible

1448
01:08:38,015 --> 01:08:39,807
Version that's almost like a

1449
01:08:40,063 --> 01:08:43,135
Harry Potter to be red

1450
01:08:43,391 --> 01:08:44,927
By people who like novels

1451
01:08:45,183 --> 01:08:46,207
It starts poochie

1452
01:08:46,719 --> 01:08:47,487
Moreland

1453
01:08:47,743 --> 01:08:53,375
In like my world just in a

1454
01:08:53,631 --> 01:08:54,655
Pure present

1455
01:08:56,191 --> 01:08:57,727
Reading

1456
01:08:57,983 --> 01:08:59,775
Rainier Maria rilke

1457
01:09:00,287 --> 01:09:02,335
A book of his poetry

1458
01:09:02,591 --> 01:09:03,103
In German

1459
01:09:03,359 --> 01:09:05,151
And then reading the translation

1460
01:09:05,407 --> 01:09:07,711
In in German and English

1461
01:09:07,967 --> 01:09:09,503
Very very close languages

1462
01:09:09,759 --> 01:09:11,807
Actually get like

1463
01:09:12,319 --> 01:09:13,599
There's such a mess of differ

1464
01:09:14,111 --> 01:09:14,623
Between those two

1465
01:09:14,879 --> 01:09:16,671
And we all understand

1466
01:09:16,927 --> 01:09:17,951
Like people who speak

1467
01:09:18,207 --> 01:09:21,023
Speak German have study German their entire lives and and

1468
01:09:21,279 --> 01:09:23,327
Translators are trying their hardest

1469
01:09:23,583 --> 01:09:24,863
To get the same kind of

1470
01:09:25,119 --> 01:09:26,655
Feeling flavor of that

1471
01:09:26,911 --> 01:09:28,447
And put it into English and you simply

1472
01:09:28,703 --> 01:09:32,799
Cannot know so that it's just something

1473
01:09:33,055 --> 01:09:35,871
Let alone something where you only have 10 words

1474
01:09:36,127 --> 01:09:37,663
That he used and you have to try and

1475
01:09:37,919 --> 01:09:38,431
Extrapolate

1476
01:09:38,687 --> 01:09:39,199
An entire language

1477
01:09:39,455 --> 01:09:41,503
Consider like

1478
01:09:42,527 --> 01:09:43,039
Idioms

1479
01:09:47,903 --> 01:09:50,975
Ways you can date

1480
01:09:51,231 --> 01:09:52,511
Like a lot of the times you

1481
01:09:52,767 --> 01:09:55,071
You can solve this. Cuz that idiom

1482
01:09:55,327 --> 01:09:57,887
Was not

1483
01:09:58,399 --> 01:10:00,959
That makes it incredibly difficult like wordplay exist

1484
01:10:01,983 --> 01:10:05,823
Languages wordplay exist in German that can't be translated to English

1485
01:10:06,079 --> 01:10:08,127
Modern languages you lose

1486
01:10:08,383 --> 01:10:13,759
A bit of Rex a bit of a player

1487
01:10:14,015 --> 01:10:18,367
It's like trying to

1488
01:10:18,623 --> 01:10:21,695
Exactly Translate

1489
01:10:25,791 --> 01:10:27,583
So let's get back into this

1490
01:10:28,607 --> 01:10:34,751
This point we are here what I would describe as a rookie

1491
01:10:35,775 --> 01:10:40,895
From Chris Putnam who's playing second fiddle

1492
01:10:41,151 --> 01:10:41,919
Throughout most of it

1493
01:10:42,175 --> 01:10:43,199
He comes

1494
01:10:43,455 --> 01:10:44,735
He comes in strong

1495
01:10:44,991 --> 01:10:45,503
5 with a

1496
01:10:45,759 --> 01:10:46,783
A very stupid thing

1497
01:10:48,319 --> 01:10:48,831
Good

1498
01:10:49,087 --> 01:10:54,463
220 30 years ago would you think there be a reality program on television about hunting for ghosts

1499
01:10:57,535 --> 01:10:58,559
Competing with each other

1500
01:10:59,327 --> 01:10:59,839
Okay

1501
01:11:00,351 --> 01:11:01,631
I think that's indicative

1502
01:11:01,887 --> 01:11:04,703
Star of the age that I mean

1503
01:11:04,959 --> 01:11:06,495
That belief in these things aren't crazy

1504
01:11:08,543 --> 01:11:09,055
Are becoming

1505
01:11:10,335 --> 01:11:11,103
Manifest

1506
01:11:11,615 --> 01:11:12,127
What

1507
01:11:13,151 --> 01:11:15,711
What are the times that is a bunch

1508
01:11:15,967 --> 01:11:16,479
Ghost hunting

1509
01:11:16,735 --> 01:11:18,783
Shows where they never find anyting

1510
01:11:19,295 --> 01:11:21,855
Most of them aren't about ghost hunting there's like

1511
01:11:22,111 --> 01:11:23,647
There's the one show that's like

1512
01:11:23,903 --> 01:11:25,695
It's really more about the fact that

1513
01:11:25,951 --> 01:11:26,463
These are a bunch

1514
01:11:26,719 --> 01:11:27,999
College students

1515
01:11:28,255 --> 01:11:29,023
Doing this

1516
01:11:29,279 --> 01:11:30,815
Aren't they cool and young and fun and they

1517
01:11:31,071 --> 01:11:32,607
Ghostbusters

1518
01:11:32,863 --> 01:11:37,471
There's that one or two frat guy was yelling at ghost to hit him and stuff like that

1519
01:11:37,983 --> 01:11:41,311
It's really more about that then there's fear on MTV that was really just about

1520
01:11:41,823 --> 01:11:47,967
Defective cameras on the person's face and everyone cries all the time

1521
01:11:52,831 --> 01:11:56,415
And stuff like that or like a prison places that are haunted

1522
01:11:56,671 --> 01:11:57,951
And they be left there

1523
01:11:58,207 --> 01:12:04,351
Have you only Video Only video it's like a team of 45 people

1524
01:12:04,607 --> 01:12:05,375
On the show

1525
01:12:05,631 --> 01:12:06,143
Is from

1526
01:12:06,399 --> 01:12:12,543
Surveillance cameras set up around the place

1527
01:12:12,799 --> 01:12:17,663
Pointing at their face at all through the night spend the night at his place

1528
01:12:18,175 --> 01:12:22,015
And throughout it they could challenges we're generally to be like two pizzas

1529
01:12:22,271 --> 01:12:23,039
HomeBase

1530
01:12:23,295 --> 01:12:26,111
Scott MTV was great they've a home-based b

1531
01:12:26,367 --> 01:12:30,719
Emma's lights and stuff like that

1532
01:12:32,255 --> 01:12:36,095
They stay in their initially and then they get these missions

1533
01:12:36,351 --> 01:12:37,887
To be like two of them half

1534
01:12:38,143 --> 01:12:38,655
Virgo

1535
01:12:38,911 --> 01:12:39,423
To like

1536
01:12:39,679 --> 01:12:40,191
The aaf

1537
01:12:40,447 --> 01:12:44,799
J wing of the prison

1538
01:12:45,055 --> 01:12:50,943
Someone hung themselves in that cell so one of the people will have to stay in that cell for like

1539
01:12:51,199 --> 01:12:55,295
30 minutes and try and contact that spirit

1540
01:12:55,551 --> 01:12:58,879
Specific and then the other person will have to go away and do something else

1541
01:12:59,135 --> 01:13:05,279
So they all end up getting left alone everybody

1542
01:13:05,535 --> 01:13:08,095
That was like the real world vs Road Rules challenge

1543
01:13:08,351 --> 01:13:14,495
I was trying to tell you got to go into the cell where somebody hung themselves but you go

1544
01:13:14,751 --> 01:13:15,775
Got to do like 30 pull-ups in

1545
01:13:17,311 --> 01:13:20,639
You got to drink a bunch of yellow about women

1546
01:13:20,895 --> 01:13:24,479
I would like that combination celebrity version

1547
01:13:24,735 --> 01:13:30,879
That one was awesome everybody wants to watch celebrities be afraid

1548
01:13:32,415 --> 01:13:34,719
As I recall

1549
01:13:34,975 --> 01:13:38,815
As I recall the only person who wasn't

1550
01:13:39,327 --> 01:13:40,863
Gary Busey have no fear

1551
01:13:41,119 --> 01:13:43,679
I celebrate you spirit

1552
01:13:44,703 --> 01:13:48,287
Gary Busey was in Point Break Dan he's never been afraid of anything

1553
01:13:48,543 --> 01:13:49,055
Thanks Drew

1554
01:13:50,335 --> 01:13:52,639
So I don't hurt my point about this

1555
01:13:52,895 --> 01:13:54,175
This more than I do

1556
01:13:54,431 --> 01:14:00,575
That happened because people realized

1557
01:14:00,831 --> 01:14:01,343
Turn this

1558
01:14:01,855 --> 01:14:02,367
Genre

1559
01:14:02,623 --> 01:14:03,135
Into a different

1560
01:14:03,391 --> 01:14:06,719
I like a reality show

1561
01:14:06,975 --> 01:14:07,743
The same way that like

1562
01:14:08,511 --> 01:14:09,535
Yeah there's a lot of different

1563
01:14:09,791 --> 01:14:12,863
Dating shows generally it's not about the dating

1564
01:14:13,119 --> 01:14:19,007
It's about the twist that you put on

1565
01:14:19,263 --> 01:14:21,055
Next was grateful next was all fake

1566
01:14:21,311 --> 01:14:22,335
There's at least shows like

1567
01:14:23,359 --> 01:14:23,871
Shipmates

1568
01:14:24,127 --> 01:14:28,479
Waiting on a boat

1569
01:14:28,735 --> 01:14:29,759
Xvideos2 chip

1570
01:14:30,015 --> 01:14:32,831
Motherfuker mates was so good

1571
01:14:35,135 --> 01:14:38,975
If we get more Project Camelot talk from Tom

1572
01:14:46,399 --> 01:14:47,679
Nation you were just showing

1573
01:14:48,191 --> 01:14:49,215
Joel Richardson

1574
01:15:03,039 --> 01:15:07,391
It's another Thursday.

1575
01:15:07,647 --> 01:15:13,535
Hear what we have is this is literally query Kerry Cassidy talks about

1576
01:15:13,791 --> 01:15:17,887
How very like all of these wars throughout history have been at the Iraq War

1577
01:15:18,143 --> 01:15:20,191
Vietnam they weren't about actual

1578
01:15:20,447 --> 01:15:26,591
Geopolitical struggles they were about closing Stargate Stargate talks like doorway portal

1579
01:15:27,359 --> 01:15:30,431
Exact same thing these people are saying their pitching the same narrative

1580
01:15:30,687 --> 01:15:31,455
Different audience

1581
01:15:32,223 --> 01:15:34,271
Confess

1582
01:15:34,527 --> 01:15:35,039
Because

1583
01:15:35,295 --> 01:15:39,647
At no point do any of these people realize that so many of these are like

1584
01:15:40,159 --> 01:15:41,439
Regional fears

1585
01:15:41,695 --> 01:15:42,719
You know like

1586
01:15:42,975 --> 01:15:45,535
These guys have a reptilian with a Halo

1587
01:15:46,047 --> 01:15:47,583
Over there you can spider leadership

1588
01:15:47,839 --> 01:15:52,703
Over here or whatever the f***

1589
01:15:53,215 --> 01:15:54,239
All of this s*** is just

1590
01:15:54,495 --> 01:15:55,007
Regional

1591
01:15:55,263 --> 01:15:55,775
Sears

1592
01:15:56,031 --> 01:15:58,335
That you can clearly take back to

1593
01:15:58,591 --> 01:16:03,711
This culture got f***** up by spiders for a while like that was kind of a

1594
01:16:04,223 --> 01:16:10,367
That was the situation everybody had their own like we get f***** on the problem

1595
01:16:10,623 --> 01:16:13,951
Komodo dragons be hardened

1596
01:16:14,207 --> 01:16:14,719
Some

1597
01:16:14,975 --> 01:16:16,255
Cultures.

1598
01:16:17,535 --> 01:16:18,047
Psychic

1599
01:16:19,583 --> 01:16:23,423
Japanese dragons in European dragon

1600
01:16:25,215 --> 01:16:25,727
Little Things

1601
01:16:29,567 --> 01:16:32,127
Intrinsic like in terms of lizards being sort of

1602
01:16:32,639 --> 01:16:34,687
Is evil

1603
01:16:36,735 --> 01:16:39,807
Yeah he's very very strong

1604
01:16:40,063 --> 01:16:41,343
Distrust of something that doesn't have legs

1605
01:16:41,855 --> 01:16:47,743
Like snake rolling around also also they can kill you

1606
01:16:48,255 --> 01:16:51,839
Also like not Elizabeth

1607
01:16:52,095 --> 01:16:52,863
Don't kill you also

1608
01:16:53,119 --> 01:16:53,631
Stilbite

1609
01:16:53,887 --> 01:16:54,399
Aeropostale

1610
01:16:54,655 --> 01:16:57,215
Can constrict you

1611
01:16:57,471 --> 01:17:00,543
And generally speaking like lizards aren't

1612
01:17:01,055 --> 01:17:01,567
So like

1613
01:17:01,823 --> 01:17:03,871
There's no reason to really like them

1614
01:17:04,383 --> 01:17:05,151
Over history

1615
01:17:05,407 --> 01:17:05,919
Lizards

1616
01:17:06,175 --> 01:17:07,967
In reptiles are

1617
01:17:08,223 --> 01:17:09,247
The greatest

1618
01:17:09,759 --> 01:17:10,527
Possible Lake

1619
01:17:11,807 --> 01:17:12,575
You're bad

1620
01:17:13,087 --> 01:17:14,111
Bugs

1621
01:17:22,047 --> 01:17:23,583
Mean also

1622
01:17:25,119 --> 01:17:27,167
What's a bird ever done for you

1623
01:17:28,191 --> 01:17:29,471
Firewood to burn ever done for you

1624
01:17:30,751 --> 01:17:31,775
But not much else

1625
01:17:37,151 --> 01:17:39,455
I would love mystery based off of Still Believe

1626
01:17:39,967 --> 01:17:43,807
Things that you like

1627
01:17:45,855 --> 01:17:47,391
F****** loudest

1628
01:17:47,647 --> 01:17:49,695
Do you think a lot of myths are based on last

1629
01:17:53,535 --> 01:17:55,327
Dude what do you know about orbs

1630
01:17:57,375 --> 01:18:00,191
So I know every time somebody asked me that question

1631
01:18:00,447 --> 01:18:04,543
The answer is not what I'm going to say do you know about phenomenon

1632
01:18:05,567 --> 01:18:06,079
Paranormal

1633
01:18:08,127 --> 01:18:08,895
Pictures of there being orbs

1634
01:18:09,407 --> 01:18:10,175
I know about the

1635
01:18:10,431 --> 01:18:11,967
The song by the Yeah Yeah Yeahs named

1636
01:18:12,991 --> 01:18:13,503
Not that

1637
01:18:13,759 --> 01:18:15,551
You don't know

1638
01:18:15,807 --> 01:18:17,343
Which

1639
01:18:17,855 --> 01:18:20,415
So orbs go to haunted places

1640
01:18:20,671 --> 01:18:21,183
Forbes

1641
01:18:21,439 --> 01:18:22,207
You take pictures

1642
01:18:22,463 --> 01:18:23,487
I just don't

1643
01:18:23,743 --> 01:18:24,255
The pictures back

1644
01:18:24,511 --> 01:18:25,279
Check-in there's orbs in

1645
01:18:25,535 --> 01:18:26,047
In the picture

1646
01:18:27,839 --> 01:18:29,119
Open always

1647
01:18:29,887 --> 01:18:32,703
Failure of the camera or more often

1648
01:18:32,959 --> 01:18:33,727
It's

1649
01:18:34,239 --> 01:18:36,287
It's the flash reflecting on a p

1650
01:18:36,543 --> 01:18:37,055
Pizza Villa

1651
01:18:37,311 --> 01:18:40,383
Interested

1652
01:18:42,431 --> 01:18:43,199
Chris Putnam

1653
01:18:43,711 --> 01:18:45,247
Not a big fan of the

1654
01:18:45,503 --> 01:18:46,527
Reasonable explanation

1655
01:18:46,783 --> 01:18:48,319
Four orbs

1656
01:18:48,575 --> 01:18:49,343
Bucking orbs

1657
01:18:50,111 --> 01:18:51,391
What's going on

1658
01:18:51,647 --> 01:18:53,183
Sedona is famous

1659
01:18:53,951 --> 01:18:54,719
Pittsburgh being

1660
01:18:55,231 --> 01:18:56,255
A portal Arrow

1661
01:18:56,767 --> 01:19:00,351
In fact there's actually one area called the Bradshaw Ranch famous

1662
01:19:00,607 --> 01:19:06,239
Already struck out a couple times on Arizona I would just stop talking about Arizona

1663
01:19:06,495 --> 01:19:08,287
Skinwalker Ranch Punk

1664
01:19:08,543 --> 01:19:11,359
Bradshaw Ranch

1665
01:19:11,871 --> 01:19:12,383
Week

1666
01:19:13,151 --> 01:19:19,039
Then after a famous stuntman brats I was a lot of the old western

1667
01:19:19,295 --> 01:19:20,063
What happened

1668
01:19:20,319 --> 01:19:23,391
Mysteriously the government ball all that land and fenced It Off

1669
01:19:25,439 --> 01:19:26,719
But now you can't even answer it

1670
01:19:28,767 --> 01:19:32,863
It's famous in the UFO community

1671
01:19:33,119 --> 01:19:37,215
It's famous in the ghost hunting

1672
01:19:37,471 --> 01:19:38,239
Now

1673
01:19:39,775 --> 01:19:41,055
Sing something on identified in

1674
01:19:41,311 --> 01:19:42,847
Sky so you don't have much

1675
01:19:43,103 --> 01:19:44,383
Problem bleeding

1676
01:19:44,639 --> 01:19:48,479
As we're probably

1677
01:19:48,735 --> 01:19:49,247
Cameron

1678
01:19:49,759 --> 01:19:52,575
They are particles and things like that

1679
01:19:52,831 --> 01:19:53,599
Just kind of

1680
01:19:53,855 --> 01:19:58,975
Some sort of anomaly with a camera reflection inside the professional photographer

1681
01:19:59,487 --> 01:20:00,511
Are we set up to camera

1682
01:20:01,023 --> 01:20:01,791
From different

1683
01:20:02,815 --> 01:20:04,095
And we actually did get orbs

1684
01:20:04,351 --> 01:20:05,119
Anselmo

1685
01:20:05,887 --> 01:20:07,935
With two cameras at same time

1686
01:20:08,191 --> 01:20:09,471
Sorry it's not the Spartacus

1687
01:20:11,519 --> 01:20:13,824
What doesn't actually prove me

1688
01:20:14,592 --> 01:20:15,104
No

1689
01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:19,200
Because if they're shooting in the same direction and there's something

1690
01:20:19,456 --> 01:20:20,736
It might reflect

1691
01:20:20,992 --> 01:20:22,016
Or refract

1692
01:20:22,272 --> 01:20:23,808
White from their Flash

1693
01:20:24,064 --> 01:20:27,648
A shooting from two angles it would do the exact same thing on both camera

1694
01:20:28,416 --> 01:20:28,928
Also

1695
01:20:29,696 --> 01:20:30,464
So-so

1696
01:20:30,976 --> 01:20:37,120
Before this before he took professional photographer out

1697
01:20:38,656 --> 01:20:44,800
So it's not like I'm assuming that they're using Flash

1698
01:20:45,056 --> 01:20:49,408
So-so

1699
01:20:49,664 --> 01:20:50,688
Resorts

1700
01:20:50,944 --> 01:20:52,736
So he knew so here's

1701
01:20:52,992 --> 01:20:54,016
B Mike

1702
01:20:54,272 --> 01:20:54,784
With us

1703
01:20:55,296 --> 01:20:56,576
He knew about orbs

1704
01:20:57,344 --> 01:20:58,368
As a thing

1705
01:20:58,624 --> 01:20:59,904
And he always thought

1706
01:21:00,160 --> 01:21:01,184
That they were

1707
01:21:01,696 --> 01:21:02,464
Something wrong with

1708
01:21:03,232 --> 01:21:05,024
Which means that he knew

1709
01:21:05,280 --> 01:21:07,584
Bet there were a lot of picture

1710
01:21:08,096 --> 01:21:08,608
Orbs

1711
01:21:11,168 --> 01:21:15,264
Is presenting it is like I thought it was bulshit before con men

1712
01:21:16,544 --> 01:21:17,824
If I understand correctly

1713
01:21:18,080 --> 01:21:18,848
The way

1714
01:21:19,872 --> 01:21:21,408
He set out to be

1715
01:21:21,664 --> 01:21:22,176
2 cameras

1716
01:21:24,736 --> 01:21:30,112
So there were hundreds of cameras no one had ever thought to do that before cameras in the past

1717
01:21:30,368 --> 01:21:32,160
That have found these orbs and he's like

1718
01:21:34,464 --> 01:21:34,976
But if I use

1719
01:21:35,232 --> 01:21:35,744
2 cameras

1720
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:40,096
Well then I know there's two cameras

1721
01:21:40,608 --> 01:21:42,400
Light is both a particle and a wave

1722
01:21:42,912 --> 01:21:43,424
Right

1723
01:21:43,680 --> 01:21:45,216
Illustrate like this

1724
01:21:45,472 --> 01:21:45,984
Guys

1725
01:21:47,520 --> 01:21:48,032
Is very gullible

1726
01:21:49,312 --> 01:21:50,080
Just not gullible

1727
01:21:50,336 --> 01:21:50,848
He just wants to put

1728
01:21:51,872 --> 01:21:52,384
Are gullible people

1729
01:21:52,640 --> 01:21:53,408
When are they going to sell

1730
01:21:53,920 --> 01:21:59,296
Cuz they have to be around the corner in a little bit because there's so much here

1731
01:21:59,552 --> 01:22:00,832
I cut out

1732
01:22:02,112 --> 01:22:03,392
Okay mostly because it's

1733
01:22:03,904 --> 01:22:05,184
I'll just that water bottle man

1734
01:22:05,440 --> 01:22:07,488
Yeah he's pushing that water bottle hard

1735
01:22:07,744 --> 01:22:13,888
It's all these packages the water bottle and Tom's book

1736
01:22:14,144 --> 01:22:20,288
Eventually we all get to see

1737
01:22:20,544 --> 01:22:22,336
We were selling yearbook staff because

1738
01:22:22,592 --> 01:22:23,872
To me honestly like

1739
01:22:24,384 --> 01:22:25,920
That is in the realm of

1740
01:22:26,944 --> 01:22:31,808
Respectable unplugging the book

1741
01:22:32,064 --> 01:22:36,160
That doesn't seem like gross salesmanship to me

1742
01:22:36,416 --> 01:22:38,208
Who have a book

1743
01:22:38,464 --> 01:22:44,608
Yeah give a little plug to the book

1744
01:22:46,144 --> 01:22:47,680
With water bottles

1745
01:22:47,936 --> 01:22:48,448
Little weird

1746
01:22:48,704 --> 01:22:49,472
But because we've

1747
01:22:49,728 --> 01:22:54,336
Ants all over the water bottle for the last two Jim Bakker episode

1748
01:22:54,848 --> 01:22:55,616
There's so much

1749
01:22:56,128 --> 01:22:56,640
Let's not

1750
01:22:56,896 --> 01:22:57,664
Jump into that

1751
01:22:57,920 --> 01:23:01,504
I will say we learned that the water bottle he's been burying the lede

1752
01:23:01,760 --> 01:23:04,064
It's not just for drinking river water

1753
01:23:06,624 --> 01:23:10,464
Is your water I did not know that I've always needed my water alkaline

1754
01:23:10,720 --> 01:23:13,024
APA brings the ph up

1755
01:23:13,280 --> 01:23:15,328
Sure

1756
01:23:15,840 --> 01:23:16,352
Be careful

1757
01:23:18,400 --> 01:23:24,288
People think acid bad bass good or something like that too much

1758
01:23:24,800 --> 01:23:26,336
Trying to bring up

1759
01:23:30,176 --> 01:23:34,272
Drinking alkalized water is that alone is dangerous

1760
01:23:39,648 --> 01:23:40,160
Turn the frogs gay

1761
01:23:43,744 --> 01:23:44,512

Long styling

1763

Giggling co-host

1764
01:23:49,120 --> 01:23:49,632
Now

1765
01:23:50,912 --> 01:23:51,936
The story

1766
01:23:52,192 --> 01:23:53,984
She also says wow

1767
01:23:54,752 --> 01:23:55,520
Wow

1768
01:23:56,800 --> 01:23:58,336
So she comes in with a story

1769
01:23:58,592 --> 01:23:59,360
And this this is

1770
01:23:59,616 --> 01:24:00,128
It's kind of fun

1771
01:24:00,384 --> 01:24:02,432
Cuz it gives us a little bit of flavor of what Lori

1772
01:24:03,456 --> 01:24:09,600
Like as a husband I'm not going to like that

1773
01:24:09,856 --> 01:24:11,648
At the end of the story

1774
01:24:12,160 --> 01:24:13,440
I actually

1775
01:24:13,952 --> 01:24:14,720
And that area

1776
01:24:14,976 --> 01:24:18,560
Mountain near Safford Arizona

1777
01:24:18,816 --> 01:24:19,584
At time

1778
01:24:20,352 --> 01:24:21,632
Actually

1779
01:24:22,144 --> 01:24:23,168
Terraria

1780
01:24:23,424 --> 01:24:24,704

1781

Cartelera

1782

Sedona

1785
01:24:31,360 --> 01:24:31,872
And

1786
01:24:32,128 --> 01:24:32,640
Buckhannon

1787
01:24:33,152 --> 01:24:34,176
I'm like

1788
01:24:35,712 --> 01:24:37,504
Blowing my mind thinking that these are

1789
01:24:39,808 --> 01:24:41,088
I have had

1790
01:24:41,344 --> 01:24:41,856
So many

1791
01:24:42,368 --> 01:24:43,136
Credible

1792
01:24:44,416 --> 01:24:45,952
Variances with the Lord what the hell

1793
01:24:46,464 --> 01:24:46,976
Ferret

1794
01:24:47,232 --> 01:24:47,744
If I told you

1795
01:24:49,536 --> 01:24:50,304
The TV off and go

1796
01:24:56,192 --> 01:24:57,216
5

1797
01:24:57,728 --> 01:24:58,752
Supernatural so I

1798
01:24:59,264 --> 01:25:01,312
No

1799
01:25:01,568 --> 01:25:04,384
Supernatural really sitting here

1800
01:25:04,896 --> 01:25:06,688
I don't know how to explain

1801
01:25:08,992 --> 01:25:11,552
As real as you're here right here honey I'm touching you

1802
01:25:11,808 --> 01:25:16,160
Supernatural Angel surrounding us all around us

1803
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:20,512
Where in

1804
01:25:21,024 --> 01:25:21,536
The final

1805
01:25:21,792 --> 01:25:22,560
Stay

1806
01:25:23,328 --> 01:25:24,352
The last days

1807
01:25:24,608 --> 01:25:25,376
Where I really

1808
01:25:25,888 --> 01:25:26,912
What the hell man

1809
01:25:28,192 --> 01:25:28,960
Your wife

1810
01:25:29,216 --> 01:25:35,360
Just told a story about seeing demons and angels

1811
01:25:36,896 --> 01:25:40,480
And then you launch off on your new phone that you wanted

1812
01:25:40,736 --> 01:25:44,320
It's the verbal equivalent of being like

1813
01:25:44,576 --> 01:25:47,136
I'm not interested in your story Lori

1814
01:25:49,184 --> 01:25:52,000
There's angels all around us right now

1815
01:25:54,304 --> 01:25:58,912
Alright we're in the final stage of the end times everybody probably ignore that

1816
01:25:59,168 --> 01:25:59,680
Bulls

1817
01:26:00,192 --> 01:26:02,240
The problem that I have is that like

1818
01:26:03,008 --> 01:26:09,152
Her story isn't out of line with the stuff they talk about it's not like that story isn't anyway like

1819
01:26:09,408 --> 01:26:11,712
She say that

1820
01:26:12,224 --> 01:26:16,064
Angel

1821
01:26:16,320 --> 01:26:19,392
These demons are all around us right now they're more real than you and me

1822
01:26:19,648 --> 01:26:22,720
This is something that everybody has literally said

1823
01:26:23,232 --> 01:26:24,768
In this f****** show

1824
01:26:25,024 --> 01:26:26,304
Baker's just like

1825
01:26:30,400 --> 01:26:33,472
Heard it before Lori Werner

1826
01:26:33,728 --> 01:26:37,056
Marry you

1827
01:26:37,312 --> 01:26:38,848
There is a there's a

1828
01:26:39,872 --> 01:26:41,920
Maybe this is a little bit one-sided

1829
01:26:46,784 --> 01:26:48,064
He's a f****** psychopath

1830
01:26:48,320 --> 01:26:49,856
Course he doesn't care if

1831
01:26:50,368 --> 01:26:50,880
Man

1832
01:26:51,136 --> 01:26:52,160
Wait till we get to the end

1833
01:26:54,976 --> 01:26:55,488
Disconnect

1834
01:26:55,744 --> 01:26:56,256
In his brain

1835
01:26:57,280 --> 01:26:57,792
Diesel

1836
01:27:00,352 --> 01:27:01,120
Psychopath

1837
01:27:01,376 --> 01:27:02,144
Is not accurate Maybe

1838
01:27:07,520 --> 01:27:09,312
Comes in

1839
01:27:13,920 --> 01:27:14,944
Uno's

1840
01:27:15,200 --> 01:27:15,968
A couple things

1841
01:27:16,224 --> 01:27:16,736
I don't think

1842
01:27:20,832 --> 01:27:21,344
Describe

1843
01:27:21,600 --> 01:27:26,208
Has been contained under the surface of the Earth again we're talking about the Earth

1844
01:27:26,464 --> 01:27:29,024
Understand

1845
01:27:29,280 --> 01:27:34,144
And they are under the surface of the Earth waiting for the day of

1846
01:27:34,912 --> 01:27:41,056
There is an extra biblical book and some Orthodox version

1847
01:27:41,312 --> 01:27:41,824
Book of Enoch

1848
01:27:42,080 --> 01:27:44,896
Stop route

1849
01:27:48,224 --> 01:27:49,760
It's only in

1850
01:27:51,808 --> 01:27:52,576
Orthodox

1851
01:27:55,136 --> 01:27:57,184
So the first thing is Hollow Earth

1852
01:27:57,696 --> 01:28:00,256
Clearly talking about Hollow Earth

1853
01:28:00,512 --> 01:28:02,048
And then also

1854
01:28:02,304 --> 01:28:03,072
The Book of Enoch

1855
01:28:03,328 --> 01:28:04,352
To those two

1856
01:28:04,608 --> 01:28:05,120
Two things

1857
01:28:06,144 --> 01:28:06,912
I don't think that's great

1858
01:28:12,800 --> 01:28:13,568
What's not great about it

1859
01:28:14,080 --> 01:28:15,616
Well one Hollow Earth is

1860
01:28:16,128 --> 01:28:22,016
It's fun to think about but if you believe it you're you're out there you're not as serious

1861
01:28:22,272 --> 01:28:23,552
You're not a Serial B

1862
01:28:23,808 --> 01:28:27,392
You're not a serious thinker 6 United States

1863
01:28:27,648 --> 01:28:28,672
Huge Hollow Earth guy

1864
01:28:29,184 --> 01:28:29,952
Reaper when was that

1865
01:28:30,720 --> 01:28:33,536
46 years ago

1866
01:28:34,048 --> 01:28:39,424
What is it that much different from what

1867
01:28:42,752 --> 01:28:43,264
Dumb

1868
01:28:44,288 --> 01:28:46,848
That's what I'm hearing from this

1869
01:28:47,872 --> 01:28:49,152
If you are listening to this

1870
01:28:49,408 --> 01:28:49,920
And you're like

1871
01:28:50,432 --> 01:28:53,760
I want to buy this guy's water bottle

1872
01:28:54,016 --> 01:28:54,784
Your f******

1873
01:28:55,040 --> 01:28:55,552
Dumb

1874
01:28:55,808 --> 01:28:56,320
B

1875
01:28:57,600 --> 01:28:59,392
Or or your

1876
01:29:01,184 --> 01:29:01,952
Suggestible

1877
01:29:02,976 --> 01:29:05,280
There's other ways to get there other than dumb

1878
01:29:07,072 --> 01:29:13,216
Circumstances maybe you live in a small town

1879
01:29:13,472 --> 01:29:13,984
No Way Out

1880
01:29:15,520 --> 01:29:16,288
Sort of accept

1881
01:29:17,312 --> 01:29:18,336
That sort of thing I don't know why

1882
01:29:18,592 --> 01:29:19,616
Sincerely.

1883
01:29:20,384 --> 01:29:22,176
Judgemental

1884
01:29:22,688 --> 01:29:26,528
Yeah I agree

1885
01:29:30,368 --> 01:29:34,976
I'm just cuz you're a victim doesn't mean you're dumped no but I also don't want to I don't want to hear doesn't mean you're not.

1886
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:38,048
Humans are the people who are

1887
01:29:38,304 --> 01:29:39,840
Caught up in the hustle

1888
01:29:40,096 --> 01:29:41,376
What we're talkin about

1889
01:29:41,632 --> 01:29:42,400
Hustler's

1890
01:29:43,680 --> 01:29:47,008
I understand that that's the worst better for them

1891
01:29:47,264 --> 01:29:47,776
Truitt's

1892
01:29:48,544 --> 01:29:50,848
God dammit that's dumb

1893
01:29:53,408 --> 01:29:54,176
Because end

1894
01:29:54,432 --> 01:29:56,224
This is again something that we talked about

1895
01:29:56,480 --> 01:29:59,296
I want to be taken in if I were to be taken in by a comment

1896
01:30:00,832 --> 01:30:01,856
Top-level Kahneman

1897
01:30:02,368 --> 01:30:07,744
These guys are taking in the dumb but also taking advantage of other people circumstances

1898
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:08,768
But they don't have any

1899
01:30:09,024 --> 01:30:09,792
Control over

1900
01:30:10,048 --> 01:30:10,816
Because of those

1901
01:30:11,328 --> 01:30:12,608
Because it's possible

1902
01:30:12,864 --> 01:30:13,632
He is a good con man

1903
01:30:13,888 --> 01:30:14,400
And for them

1904
01:30:17,728 --> 01:30:19,776
Trigger things in other people that it doesn't Trigger or not

1905
01:30:20,032 --> 01:30:21,056
True

1906
01:30:21,568 --> 01:30:22,336
You know

1907
01:30:22,592 --> 01:30:26,176
I don't want this to be some sort of weird

1908
01:30:28,992 --> 01:30:31,808
Everything is relative kind of argument

1909
01:30:32,064 --> 01:30:33,344
Some things are fairly relative

1910
01:30:33,600 --> 01:30:35,136
A good con man

1911
01:30:35,392 --> 01:30:35,904
To you is not

1912
01:30:36,160 --> 01:30:37,952
The same thing as a good man con man

1913
01:30:38,208 --> 01:30:38,720
Does someone in

1914
01:30:39,232 --> 01:30:40,000
I don't know

1915
01:30:40,768 --> 01:30:42,560
Auxvasse Missouri

1916
01:30:42,816 --> 01:30:45,376
You know like Tiny Town Missouri

1917
01:30:47,168 --> 01:30:47,680
Place to go there whenever

1918
01:30:48,448 --> 01:30:49,984
Right there was a lot of portals

1919
01:30:50,752 --> 01:30:51,264
So much

1920
01:30:51,520 --> 01:30:57,664
Selma sport Alexa

1921
01:30:57,920 --> 01:30:58,688
Bad to be

1922
01:30:59,200 --> 01:30:59,968
Text super into the book

1923
01:31:00,992 --> 01:31:02,784
I'll get to it a little bit after

1924
01:31:07,136 --> 01:31:07,904
When it's going to happen

1925
01:31:08,416 --> 01:31:11,744
He said that's going to happen Generations

1926
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:12,512
The Flash

1927
01:31:15,072 --> 01:31:19,168
What is a generation will the generation based on Psalms 90:10 is 70 years

1928
01:31:19,936 --> 01:31:23,264
So you would say if I could go

1929
01:31:23,520 --> 01:31:27,360
70 generations of 70 years which is 4900 years

1930
01:31:31,456 --> 01:31:32,992
Statistics

1931
01:31:33,248 --> 01:31:35,808
Groups are working on the Holocene impact

1932
01:31:36,064 --> 01:31:39,136
Because they think a meteor hit the earth and that's what caused

1933
01:31:42,208 --> 01:31:46,560
Vista 4849

1934
01:31:46,816 --> 01:31:52,960
The 2829 hundred b.c.

1935
01:31:53,984 --> 01:32:00,128
49ers 2015 2016 2017

1936
01:32:06,016 --> 01:32:11,136
I thought you were setting up

1937
01:32:11,392 --> 01:32:11,904
So

1938
01:32:14,208 --> 01:32:14,720
Alright

1939
01:32:15,488 --> 01:32:16,768
Whatever I don't think the Hollis

1940
01:32:17,280 --> 01:32:19,328
Impact group is a reputable group of science

1941
01:32:22,400 --> 01:32:23,936
So if we say

1942
01:32:24,192 --> 01:32:26,496
2800 BC was when the flood happen

1943
01:32:26,752 --> 01:32:27,264
When did we

1944
01:32:27,520 --> 01:32:28,288
We

1945
01:32:28,544 --> 01:32:30,080
Stipulate that in the Arkham

1946
01:32:30,592 --> 01:32:31,104
Just say whatever

1947
01:32:31,616 --> 01:32:32,640
This doesn't

1948
01:32:32,896 --> 01:32:33,664
This is tough

1949
01:32:34,176 --> 01:32:35,712
To work out with the Book of Enoch

1950
01:32:36,480 --> 01:32:37,248
Because

1951
01:32:37,504 --> 01:32:39,040
Enoch was Noah's great grandfather

1952
01:32:39,552 --> 01:32:40,320
According to the Bible

1953
01:32:41,600 --> 01:32:44,928
To use the 70 generator

1954
01:32:45,696 --> 01:32:49,536
If 2800 BCU is BCE was on the flood happen

1955
01:32:50,304 --> 01:32:51,072
Three generation

1956
01:32:51,328 --> 01:32:52,608
Four generations back

1957
01:32:52,864 --> 01:32:53,632
I will be around

1958
01:32:54,144 --> 01:32:54,656
3000

1959
01:32:55,680 --> 01:32:57,728
Enoch would have been around

1960
01:32:58,240 --> 01:32:59,520
But the problem is

1961
01:32:59,776 --> 01:33:02,080
Book of Enoch sold as parts were written in

1962
01:33:02,336 --> 01:33:02,848
300b

1963
01:33:03,872 --> 01:33:06,688
And then the most recent parts of them are dated to about 1

1964
01:33:08,224 --> 01:33:09,760
So when the flood half

1965
01:33:10,528 --> 01:33:11,296
No

1966
01:33:12,832 --> 01:33:15,136
I don't think that anyone makes the argument that

1967
01:33:15,392 --> 01:33:15,904
Enoch

1968
01:33:16,160 --> 01:33:16,928
Wrote the book of

1969
01:33:17,440 --> 01:33:20,000
There was in the Enochs now

1970
01:33:20,512 --> 01:33:21,280
But it's in the Enoch

1971
01:33:21,536 --> 01:33:22,304
Skiing tradition

1972
01:33:22,560 --> 01:33:23,072
You don't

1973
01:33:23,328 --> 01:33:25,376
Right you don't name the book you right after

1974
01:33:26,144 --> 01:33:32,288
That would be very idealistic

1975
01:33:32,544 --> 01:33:35,104
A book called

1976
01:33:35,360 --> 01:33:36,384
Jordan why not

1977
01:33:36,640 --> 01:33:38,688
Because I wouldn't I would wait

1978
01:33:39,200 --> 01:33:39,712
Somebody else wrote it

1979
01:33:40,736 --> 01:33:41,248
Call Jordan

1980
01:33:41,504 --> 01:33:47,648
Come on these sorts of ideas of modesty or modern

1981
01:33:47,904 --> 01:33:48,928
Want to write books about

1982
01:33:49,184 --> 01:33:50,208
And that's fine

1983
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:54,560
Text thank you but I don't think I can get

1984
01:33:54,816 --> 01:33:57,120
I think it's fine for the

1985
01:33:59,168 --> 01:34:01,216
If you not had written The Book of Enoch

1986
01:34:01,472 --> 01:34:01,984
Centerview

1987
01:34:02,496 --> 01:34:03,520
Severe

1988
01:34:03,776 --> 01:34:05,056
Severe problem

1989
01:34:05,568 --> 01:34:07,616
That timeline when you would have been alive

1990
01:34:07,872 --> 01:34:09,408
Is impossible for when the book was written

1991
01:34:10,176 --> 01:34:11,968
The other problem is but he's only

1992
01:34:13,504 --> 01:34:14,272
A couple books

1993
01:34:14,784 --> 01:34:16,832
In the Bible only a couple times

1994
01:34:17,088 --> 01:34:19,136
There's maybe like three or four references to

1995
01:34:19,392 --> 01:34:20,928
Enoch one being that he

1996
01:34:21,184 --> 01:34:22,464
Was along with

1997
01:34:24,512 --> 01:34:26,816
He's one of two people who ever didn't die

1998
01:34:27,072 --> 01:34:28,352
But God brought him up to heaven

1999
01:34:29,888 --> 01:34:30,912
Elijah

2000
01:34:31,168 --> 01:34:33,984
People who have never died are Elijah and Enoch

2001
01:34:35,776 --> 01:34:37,568
Let's

2002
01:34:37,824 --> 01:34:39,360
There's a reference to

2003
01:34:40,384 --> 01:34:41,152
But

2004
01:34:41,920 --> 01:34:42,944
East

2005
01:34:43,456 --> 01:34:44,736
Hey

2006
01:34:44,992 --> 01:34:46,016
Hey Jordan

2007
01:34:47,040 --> 01:34:49,344
There's no reference to him in

2008
01:34:49,856 --> 01:34:51,648
Parts of the Noah story the story of

2009
01:34:51,904 --> 01:34:54,976
The fly the Deluge there's no eyes

2010
01:34:55,232 --> 01:34:55,744
Grandpa at least one

2011
01:34:56,000 --> 01:35:02,144
What is great-grandfather predicted the flood it would seem incredibly relevant those stories of

2012
01:35:02,400 --> 01:35:04,704
Noah and the flood were written before the Book of Enoch

2013
01:35:05,216 --> 01:35:07,520
So that's why those aren't

2014
01:35:07,776 --> 01:35:08,288
In that book

2015
01:35:08,544 --> 01:35:11,104
Well they were also written before the

2016
01:35:12,384 --> 01:35:13,664
Told about the flood

2017
01:35:14,176 --> 01:35:20,320
Plug message been around

2018
01:35:20,832 --> 01:35:22,112
This piece of the mythology

2019
01:35:22,368 --> 01:35:23,136
If you would have been present

2020
01:35:23,392 --> 01:35:24,928
If so many other places

2021
01:35:25,184 --> 01:35:26,208
If it were

2022
01:35:26,464 --> 01:35:27,488
Some part that wasn't

2023
01:35:28,256 --> 01:35:28,768
Pseudepigrapha

2024
01:35:30,304 --> 01:35:33,632
Watch later

2025
01:35:33,888 --> 01:35:34,656
Book is

2026
01:35:35,168 --> 01:35:38,496
Interesting I liked it I think there's a lot of really interesting contest

2027
01:35:40,544 --> 01:35:42,848
My favorite part was when Hermione's

2028
01:35:43,104 --> 01:35:44,384
Cast the spell in Enoch

2029
01:35:45,152 --> 01:35:45,920
Tournament

2030
01:35:46,176 --> 01:35:48,480
Into a frog

2031
01:35:48,736 --> 01:35:50,528
Something something

2032
01:35:53,856 --> 01:35:56,160
There's some that is the best name to a sequel

2033
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:01,792
Something dumplings name for the

2034
01:36:02,560 --> 01:36:03,328
I'm liking that

2035
01:36:03,584 --> 01:36:06,144
Yada yada yada

2036
01:36:06,400 --> 01:36:08,704
Snayper whatever

2037
01:36:08,960 --> 01:36:11,008
Yourself and I'm trying

2038
01:36:11,264 --> 01:36:13,824
There's a there's a reason that it's not

2039
01:36:14,080 --> 01:36:14,592
Included in the canner

2040
01:36:16,384 --> 01:36:17,664
For me to say at someone who really doesn't give

2041
01:36:19,456 --> 01:36:19,968
In the Bible

2042
01:36:20,224 --> 01:36:24,832
There's plenty of Reason Just based on like biblical scholarship look at the times that it was written

2043
01:36:25,088 --> 01:36:26,880
Factory was written over the course of like

2044
01:36:27,136 --> 01:36:27,904
200 years

2045
01:36:28,160 --> 01:36:28,928
Difference

2046
01:36:29,184 --> 01:36:29,696
Between the

2047
01:36:29,952 --> 01:36:31,744
Like the oldest Parts on the newest parts

2048
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:32,768
Affected comes

2049
01:36:33,024 --> 01:36:33,536
From

2050
01:36:34,048 --> 01:36:35,584
Traditions that are outside

2051
01:36:35,840 --> 01:36:37,120
Of what

2052
01:36:38,912 --> 01:36:39,424
I get it

2053
01:36:39,936 --> 01:36:42,752
In the fact that he is bringing the same as like a like

2054
01:36:43,008 --> 01:36:44,288
Strong primary source

2055
01:36:44,544 --> 01:36:45,312
Means to me that

2056
01:36:45,568 --> 01:36:46,336
He doesn't care

2057
01:36:46,592 --> 01:36:47,104
About like

2058
01:36:47,360 --> 01:36:49,408
Actual biblical scholarship

2059
01:36:49,664 --> 01:36:51,712
He cares about like oh this is fun

2060
01:36:52,224 --> 01:36:53,504
This this sort of

2061
01:36:53,760 --> 01:36:57,856
Weaves into my already existing beliefs

2062
01:36:58,112 --> 01:37:00,672
That's the way that they treat everything

2063
01:37:00,928 --> 01:37:02,976
They trying to create that website

2064
01:37:05,792 --> 01:37:06,560
God dammit

2065
01:37:06,816 --> 01:37:12,448
You're helping somehow you're frustrated with running I'm not frustrated by it it's just

2066
01:37:13,728 --> 01:37:15,008
Are there

2067
01:37:16,032 --> 01:37:18,592
Has less obvious

2068
01:37:18,848 --> 01:37:23,712
Texting whatever

2069
01:37:25,504 --> 01:37:26,528
That's what I do

2070
01:37:27,040 --> 01:37:27,552
Jesus

2071
01:37:27,808 --> 01:37:28,320
I just

2072
01:37:28,832 --> 01:37:29,600
I hate I hate

2073
01:37:29,856 --> 01:37:30,368

2074
01:37:30,624 --> 01:37:31,648
How do you assholes

2075
01:37:31,904 --> 01:37:33,184
Spend all of their time

2076
01:37:33,696 --> 01:37:34,464
Demonizing

2077
01:37:34,976 --> 01:37:35,488
Scientist

2078
01:37:35,744 --> 01:37:37,280
Who are running CERN

2079
01:37:37,536 --> 01:37:39,072
Trying to figure out

2080
01:37:39,328 --> 01:37:42,656
Universe

2081
01:37:42,912 --> 01:37:44,192
The moment they're like

2082
01:37:45,472 --> 01:37:46,496
As far as

2083
01:37:46,752 --> 01:37:52,896
Giants and portals

2084
01:37:53,152 --> 01:37:56,480
You guys confirm what you already know using science

2085
01:37:56,736 --> 01:37:59,552
So now whenever somebody disagrees with you

2086
01:37:59,808 --> 01:38:00,320
Guess what you have

2087
01:38:01,344 --> 01:38:03,648
Giant Schnauzer

2088
01:38:06,976 --> 01:38:13,120
Double blind

2089
01:38:14,144 --> 01:38:14,912

01:38:16,192 --> 01:38:19,776
Talk about them

2091
01:38:20,288 --> 01:38:21,312
Actually know a guy who worked

2092
01:38:21,568 --> 01:38:22,592
Concern

2093
01:38:23,360 --> 01:38:24,896
We are bored

2094
01:38:27,456 --> 01:38:28,224
What was that game

2095
01:38:28,480 --> 01:38:28,992
Ha

2096
01:38:30,784 --> 01:38:31,296

2098
01:38:36,160 --> 01:38:40,000
Oh no I actually know what gif

2099
01:38:43,328 --> 01:38:47,424
I used to run a comedy show this guy used to come out to it

2100
01:38:47,680 --> 01:38:48,704
Every week

2101
01:38:48,960 --> 01:38:49,728
Show up late

2102
01:38:50,240 --> 01:38:51,520
Dance party after

2103
01:38:53,824 --> 01:38:55,616
And then

2104
01:38:57,408 --> 01:38:59,712
Mid late 50s year old guy

2105
01:38:59,968 --> 01:39:01,248
Kept to himself

2106
01:39:01,504 --> 01:39:03,296
Heat shield for like the last 20 minutes

2107
01:39:03,552 --> 01:39:04,576
To the show and then dance

2108
01:39:05,088 --> 01:39:05,600

01:39:05,856 --> 01:39:08,416
Love it and so I was very confused by

2110
01:39:09,440 --> 01:39:10,464
I couldn't figure out what

2111
01:39:12,512 --> 01:39:13,280
And soda

2112
01:39:14,304 --> 01:39:15,328
Around that time

2113
01:39:15,840 --> 01:39:16,352
Mike Timlin

2114
01:39:16,608 --> 01:39:18,656
Very funny comedians Mike Timlin

2115
01:39:18,912 --> 01:39:20,704
He became one of our

2116
01:39:23,264 --> 01:39:23,776
I grabbed them

2117
01:39:25,312 --> 01:39:26,080
Your first job

2118
01:39:27,104 --> 01:39:27,872
Is to find out what that

2119
01:39:28,896 --> 01:39:30,176
Cuz I want to ask him

2120
01:39:30,688 --> 01:39:31,456
And I f****** cat

2121
01:39:31,712 --> 01:39:33,504
I can't emotionally do it

2122
01:39:34,528 --> 01:39:36,320
Just need to know why he's here cuz I

2123
01:39:36,576 --> 01:39:42,720
He's not threatening he wasn't James again grabbing on people right you must a problem but he confuse the s*** out of

2124
01:39:43,232 --> 01:39:45,024
So first known abuse of an intern

2125
01:39:45,536 --> 01:39:49,120
No very first one has ever been

2126
01:39:49,376 --> 01:39:50,400
So the end of the night

2127
01:39:50,656 --> 01:39:52,192
I talked to him

2128
01:39:54,496 --> 01:39:55,008
He works

2129
01:39:55,520 --> 01:39:56,544
FTI Hadron Collider

2130
01:39:57,568 --> 01:39:58,080
Swiss

2131
01:39:59,104 --> 01:39:59,872
He's on vacation

2132
01:40:00,384 --> 01:40:00,896
He's doing

2133
01:40:01,152 --> 01:40:03,200
He's here first season in Chicago

2134
01:40:03,456 --> 01:40:04,480
He's a long vacation

2135
01:40:04,992 --> 01:40:06,272
And Jackie loves yoga

2136
01:40:06,784 --> 01:40:07,808
So he's late because he goes

2137
01:40:08,064 --> 01:40:08,576
Yoga class

2138
01:40:09,088 --> 01:40:10,112
But likes to dance

2139
01:40:10,368 --> 01:40:10,880
And also likes

2140
01:40:11,136 --> 01:40:11,648
The show

2141
01:40:11,904 --> 01:40:13,184
Wishes he could come on time

2142
01:40:13,440 --> 01:40:13,952
But

2143
01:40:14,208 --> 01:40:16,256
Yoga classes more important

2144
01:40:16,512 --> 01:40:18,816
Save-A-Lot going on with that guy

2145
01:40:19,328 --> 01:40:25,472
You are the best internet ever you got all of the information that you've ever wanted

2146
01:40:25,728 --> 01:40:26,496
We never really

2147
01:40:26,752 --> 01:40:27,520
Quick bite

2148
01:40:27,776 --> 01:40:31,616
The headliner

2149
01:40:36,992 --> 01:40:39,040
Is that show or a couple weeks later

2150
01:40:43,392 --> 01:40:45,696
Amazing storyteller

2151
01:40:45,952 --> 01:40:46,464
Amazing

2152
01:40:46,720 --> 01:40:49,024
And afterwards

2153
01:40:49,280 --> 01:40:51,328
And this guy who worked at CERN

2154
01:40:51,584 --> 01:40:53,888
Ended up at the bar next to each other

2155
01:40:54,144 --> 01:40:54,912
I became

2156
01:40:55,680 --> 01:40:56,192
FastFrame

2157
01:40:56,960 --> 01:41:03,104
A bit guy who ended up doing the blackout Diaries

2158
01:41:03,360 --> 01:41:05,152
Captain touch

2159
01:41:05,408 --> 01:41:07,712
Super nice guy

2160
01:41:07,968 --> 01:41:08,736
So

2161
01:41:09,248 --> 01:41:14,112
The only story I have that relates to that is

2162
01:41:14,368 --> 01:41:15,136
There is a

2163
01:41:15,392 --> 01:41:16,160
Karaoke bar

2164
01:41:16,672 --> 01:41:17,440
Attiki

2165
01:41:17,696 --> 01:41:18,976
Key themes karaoke

2166
01:41:25,632 --> 01:41:27,680
Too many teeth ER

2167
01:41:27,936 --> 01:41:29,216
Navigate to Lincoln

2168
01:41:30,496 --> 01:41:32,032
There is this guy who

2169
01:41:32,288 --> 01:41:33,056
Comes dressed

2170
01:41:33,312 --> 01:41:33,824
Scrubs

2171
01:41:36,128 --> 01:41:37,408
He comes directly from

2172
01:41:41,248 --> 01:41:44,320
Alright alright

2173
01:41:46,624 --> 01:41:47,392
But he's

2174
01:41:48,160 --> 01:41:48,928
He stings

2175
01:41:49,184 --> 01:41:50,208
Every third song

2176
01:41:50,720 --> 01:41:51,744
He goes

2177
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:53,024
Hard this dude

2178
01:41:53,280 --> 01:41:54,560
His entire life

2179
01:41:54,816 --> 01:41:56,096
Is wearing scrubs

2180
01:41:56,864 --> 01:41:57,632
Singing this song

2181
01:41:57,888 --> 01:41:59,168
And I've always wanted to ask

2182
01:41:59,680 --> 01:42:00,704
Whether or not he asked

2183
01:42:01,728 --> 01:42:02,240
At a hospital

2184
01:42:02,496 --> 01:42:04,288
Never

2185
01:42:04,544 --> 01:42:10,688
I never had the

2186
01:42:10,944 --> 01:42:12,480
An intern I would know everything about the

2187
01:42:13,248 --> 01:42:13,760
Who's the best

2188
01:42:18,368 --> 01:42:18,880
Oh God

2189
01:42:22,464 --> 01:42:23,232
Michelle

2190
01:42:23,488 --> 01:42:24,000
Holy

2191
01:42:24,256 --> 01:42:25,792
S*** not going to do it

2192
01:42:26,048 --> 01:42:26,560
By the way

2193
01:42:26,816 --> 01:42:28,352
You know you know

2194
01:42:30,400 --> 01:42:30,912
Convincing

2195
01:42:31,680 --> 01:42:32,960
Office out

2196
01:42:33,216 --> 01:42:35,520
Talk about stuff not related

2197
01:42:36,032 --> 01:42:36,544
Strictly speaking

2198
01:42:36,800 --> 01:42:38,592
Do the episode no jump back in

2199
01:42:38,848 --> 01:42:39,872
I text

2200
01:42:40,128 --> 01:42:41,152
And I told you

2201
01:42:41,664 --> 01:42:42,176
For the show

2202
01:42:44,224 --> 01:42:45,248
Of information

2203
01:42:48,320 --> 01:42:49,344
Indicates to me

2204
01:42:49,856 --> 01:42:50,880
Did Jim Bakker

2205
01:42:52,928 --> 01:42:53,952
Have not in any way

2206
01:42:54,208 --> 01:42:54,976
Wrestled with

2207
01:42:55,744 --> 01:42:56,768
What the Bible is

2208
01:42:57,280 --> 01:42:59,840
What is cultural historical context is

2209
01:43:01,120 --> 01:43:02,400
They know that's from the past

2210
01:43:03,424 --> 01:43:05,472
Corn is on here and

2211
01:43:05,728 --> 01:43:07,264
Hocking Hills

2212
01:43:07,520 --> 01:43:09,312
Translation of the Pacific

2213
01:43:11,104 --> 01:43:12,640
Do you know what that is

2214
01:43:15,968 --> 01:43:16,736
So

2215
01:43:16,992 --> 01:43:18,016
What it is is it

2216
01:43:18,272 --> 01:43:24,416
You mocked me for making that you use

2217
01:43:24,672 --> 01:43:29,024
Did you notice

2218
01:43:30,816 --> 01:43:31,584
The earliest

2219
01:43:31,840 --> 01:43:33,376
Greek translation

2220
01:43:33,632 --> 01:43:34,400
Like

2221
01:43:34,656 --> 01:43:35,168
Depends

2222
01:43:35,680 --> 01:43:41,824
Or the auditorium the first five books of the Old Testament

2223
01:43:42,080 --> 01:43:43,616
It was something that was worked on

2224
01:43:43,872 --> 01:43:47,200
14 years added in a bunch of like

2225
01:43:47,712 --> 01:43:48,736
Prophet book

2226
01:43:49,248 --> 01:43:51,808
What are called Deuteronomy

2227
01:43:52,320 --> 01:43:53,344
Deuteronomy ProBook

2228
01:43:55,904 --> 01:43:56,672
Opso

2229
01:43:56,928 --> 01:43:57,440
He's

2230
01:43:57,696 --> 01:43:58,720
You selling

2231
01:43:59,744 --> 01:44:00,512
Translation in

2232
01:44:00,768 --> 01:44:01,280
To English

2233
01:44:01,536 --> 01:44:02,304
Of the septic

2234
01:44:04,864 --> 01:44:05,632
Pronounce that terribly

2235
01:44:06,912 --> 01:44:10,240
It's weird there's too many vowels and places you don't expect it

2236
01:44:10,752 --> 01:44:13,056
They see something here

2237
01:44:13,824 --> 01:44:14,336
That is

2238
01:44:14,848 --> 01:44:15,360
Deeply

2239
01:44:15,872 --> 01:44:16,896
Deeply flawed

2240
01:44:17,408 --> 01:44:18,176
So he wrote fancy

2241
01:44:18,688 --> 01:44:19,200
No

2242
01:44:19,456 --> 01:44:22,528
I believe we actually accurate

2243
01:44:22,784 --> 01:44:24,064
From the Greek

2244
01:44:25,088 --> 01:44:28,416
Okay

2245
01:44:30,464 --> 01:44:31,744
I'm going to say it's not a great

2246
01:44:32,256 --> 01:44:34,048
Translation

2247
01:44:34,304 --> 01:44:35,072
Define

2248
01:44:35,328 --> 01:44:35,840
But

2249
01:44:36,864 --> 01:44:38,912
In this clip Jim Bakker says something and

2250
01:44:39,168 --> 01:44:39,680
In response to

2251
01:44:39,936 --> 01:44:40,448
I'm talking

2252
01:44:40,704 --> 01:44:41,472
About

2253
01:44:43,264 --> 01:44:44,288
And then

2254
01:44:44,544 --> 01:44:45,312
Something weird

2255
01:44:46,336 --> 01:44:47,360
So this would be

2256
01:44:49,664 --> 01:44:50,944
The disciples

2257
01:44:51,200 --> 01:44:51,712
Whatever

2258
01:44:51,968 --> 01:44:53,248
Read from

2259
01:44:55,808 --> 01:45:01,952
Listen for Lori's house again

2260
01:45:02,208 --> 01:45:02,720
And it we're just

2261
01:45:02,976 --> 01:45:03,744
Kickin It Out

2262
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:04,512
We like

2263
01:45:04,768 --> 01:45:06,560
2 weeks and we can open the house

2264
01:45:07,072 --> 01:45:07,840
I mean two weeks

2265
01:45:08,096 --> 01:45:09,632
I mean it's not going to be open

2266
01:45:13,472 --> 01:45:14,752
Fire Marshal

2267
01:45:15,008 --> 01:45:16,288
To go in

2268
01:45:17,568 --> 01:45:20,384
Already married

2269
01:45:20,640 --> 01:45:22,176
I got to get some water faucet

2270
01:45:22,432 --> 01:45:24,480
Sit down to is well we about to

2271
01:45:24,736 --> 01:45:26,528
Finished at all

2272
01:45:30,624 --> 01:45:32,672
Weird

2273
01:45:32,928 --> 01:45:33,696
So weird

2274
01:45:33,952 --> 01:45:38,304
You have an entire episode where they discuss the reality of portals and

2275
01:45:39,328 --> 01:45:40,608
Reptiles with Halo

2276
01:45:40,864 --> 01:45:41,376
Other life

2277
01:45:42,144 --> 01:45:44,192
What's the fire marshal gives us the permit

2278
01:45:44,448 --> 01:45:50,592
I just $1,000

2279
01:45:54,432 --> 01:45:59,296
Turnover you yelling I think it'll still come up in the audio but like he was like

2280
01:45:59,552 --> 01:46:05,696
He's talking about that step 2 again so this is what the disciples read and then Laurie is like

2281
01:46:05,952 --> 01:46:09,536
Isn't that a listen

2282
01:46:09,792 --> 01:46:15,680
That's it that's what I was hoping to see you just tell him to shut the f****** because his old ass mind is still like

2283
01:46:15,936 --> 01:46:17,984
Oh I've got on the thought that I need to sell

2284
01:46:18,240 --> 01:46:23,104
Are you

2285
01:46:23,872 --> 01:46:24,384
Crazy

2286
01:46:24,896 --> 01:46:25,664
So

2287
01:46:26,432 --> 01:46:28,480
Do the activity side I will get

2288
01:46:31,296 --> 01:46:32,064
This being credit

2289
01:46:32,320 --> 01:46:37,440
This is this is where we're talking about the Bible that Jesus would have

2290
01:46:37,952 --> 01:46:42,048
So Jim and Tommy both suggesting that the Septuagint is

2291
01:46:42,560 --> 01:46:43,584
Because I have some sort of

2292
01:46:44,096 --> 01:46:45,888
Different scripture fear scripture

2293
01:46:46,400 --> 01:46:49,216
And if they're saying that it's the one that

2294
01:46:52,800 --> 01:46:53,568
The biggest problem is

2295
01:46:53,824 --> 01:46:56,896
Most of it's not all of Jesus's disciples were illiterate

2296
01:46:57,664 --> 01:47:01,248
Professor of theology at the University of London Catherine Hessler estimation

2297
01:47:01,504 --> 01:47:02,272
Literacy rate at the

2298
01:47:02,528 --> 01:47:03,296
The time and area

2299
01:47:03,552 --> 01:47:05,600
When the apostles were alive would have been approximately

2300
01:47:06,112 --> 01:47:06,880
Percent

2301
01:47:07,136 --> 01:47:09,440
Entirely made up of what you call the culturally

2302
01:47:09,696 --> 01:47:10,720
The priests and academics

2303
01:47:10,976 --> 01:47:11,744
Of the day

2304
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:13,792
The disciples were definitely not

2305
01:47:14,304 --> 01:47:15,584
Specifically

2306
01:47:15,840 --> 01:47:16,608
Purposefully not

2307
01:47:16,864 --> 01:47:19,680
You had Andrew Peter James and John who are all fishing

2308
01:47:20,192 --> 01:47:22,752
One-hundred-percent not know how to read

2309
01:47:23,008 --> 01:47:24,288
Fisher of men

2310
01:47:24,544 --> 01:47:30,688
12 metaphors used disciples were f****** fishermen because in Galilee that have

2311
01:47:30,944 --> 01:47:32,736
Very vibrant fishing economy

2312
01:47:33,760 --> 01:47:34,272
Crazy

2313
01:47:35,296 --> 01:47:38,112
There was some indications that Judas was previously a thief

2314
01:47:38,368 --> 01:47:39,648
Which doesn't require education

2315
01:47:40,160 --> 01:47:44,256
Matthew was a tax collector but that position was actually wouldn't

2316
01:47:44,512 --> 01:47:46,816
The proper historical context is less than 1 who audits

2317
01:47:47,072 --> 01:47:48,352
Spreadsheets are does accounting

2318
01:47:48,608 --> 01:47:52,192
Is Boursin who literally takes coins for people and delivers them to someone else

2319
01:47:52,704 --> 01:47:57,056
More of a courier or even just someone who sits at a booth when people come and bring them money

2320
01:47:57,312 --> 01:47:59,616
As he's described to be in Matthew 9

2321
01:48:00,128 --> 01:48:00,640
Simoniz

2322
01:48:00,896 --> 01:48:05,248
Described as a zealot which likely means that he was a political agitator against the Roman governor

2323
01:48:05,760 --> 01:48:07,040
Which is more of a rabble-rouser

2324
01:48:07,296 --> 01:48:08,064
Kind of think America

2325
01:48:08,320 --> 01:48:09,344
Political activists

2326
01:48:09,600 --> 01:48:10,368
Most

2327
01:48:10,624 --> 01:48:11,648
So who know how to read

2328
01:48:11,904 --> 01:48:16,256
It was more just like a

2329
01:48:18,304 --> 01:48:20,096
The rest of them were likely fisherman

2330
01:48:20,352 --> 01:48:22,912
But it's on specific for a bunch of the dudes

2331
01:48:23,168 --> 01:48:23,680
Analogies

2332
01:48:24,704 --> 01:48:25,472
At the assumption

2333
01:48:25,728 --> 01:48:27,520
Statesboro is the Bible describes

2334
01:48:27,776 --> 01:48:28,288
Thomas and

2335
01:48:28,544 --> 01:48:29,056
Bartholomew

2336
01:48:29,312 --> 01:48:31,360
Being caught off guard fishing

2337
01:48:31,616 --> 01:48:33,408
At some point like I said

2338
01:48:33,664 --> 01:48:35,200
Galilee was a major fishing

2339
01:48:35,456 --> 01:48:36,480
Import

2340
01:48:36,992 --> 01:48:37,504
The economy

2341
01:48:37,760 --> 01:48:38,272
And

2342
01:48:38,528 --> 01:48:40,320
The idea that like

2343
01:48:40,576 --> 01:48:41,344
One of the most

2344
01:48:41,600 --> 01:48:42,624
Famous scriptures

2345
01:48:42,880 --> 01:48:44,672
Famous sayings of Jesus

2346
01:48:44,928 --> 01:48:45,696
You Fishers of Men

2347
01:48:45,952 --> 01:48:48,768
Doesn't really make sense unless you're talking to a bunch of fish guys

2348
01:48:49,024 --> 01:48:51,328
And that is the that is a profession

2349
01:48:51,584 --> 01:48:52,608
Confirm most of his

2350
01:48:52,864 --> 01:48:56,704
They would not have known how to read they knew that's all you need

2351
01:48:56,960 --> 01:48:58,752
Jim Bakker

2352
01:48:59,008 --> 01:49:00,032
Reselling

2353
01:49:00,544 --> 01:49:01,824
Port is selling this

2354
01:49:02,080 --> 01:49:02,592
Septuagint

2355
01:49:03,616 --> 01:49:05,920
Being what the apostles would have read

2356
01:49:06,432 --> 01:49:07,200
F****** horseshit

2357
01:49:07,456 --> 01:49:07,968
They don't know

2358
01:49:08,224 --> 01:49:08,736
Know how to read

2359
01:49:08,992 --> 01:49:10,016
Did you know how to write

2360
01:49:10,272 --> 01:49:13,344
And a lot of people might be single how did they write the Books literacy

2361
01:49:14,368 --> 01:49:15,904
They did well

2362
01:49:16,160 --> 01:49:19,232
Logical conclusion

2363
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:23,072
Didn't accept

2364
01:49:23,328 --> 01:49:24,608
Any of the synoptic Gospels

2365
01:49:24,864 --> 01:49:28,704
But Paul was almost certainly I believe I believe

2366
01:49:28,960 --> 01:49:33,056
Paul was Walmart was literally

2367
01:49:33,312 --> 01:49:34,336
Paul definitely

2368
01:49:34,592 --> 01:49:37,408
You didn't write even along the lines of

2369
01:49:37,920 --> 01:49:38,432
Everything

2370
01:49:38,688 --> 01:49:41,248
In the Bible wasn't written by the person that they sing

2371
01:49:41,504 --> 01:49:42,016
Almost

2372
01:49:42,272 --> 01:49:43,040
Across-the-board

2373
01:49:45,856 --> 01:49:50,208
Most people believed to be either a a rabbi or

2374
01:49:51,744 --> 01:49:52,768
AAA

2375
01:49:53,024 --> 01:49:57,376
Misrepresent wherever right is most likely able to

2376
01:49:58,144 --> 01:49:59,680
It's possible there's actually

2377
01:49:59,936 --> 01:50:01,728
Two there's two main

2378
01:50:01,984 --> 01:50:02,496
Corporate

2379
01:50:03,776 --> 01:50:04,288
Historical

2380
01:50:05,056 --> 01:50:06,080
I don't I haven't looked into

2381
01:50:06,336 --> 01:50:06,848
A long time

2382
01:50:07,104 --> 01:50:08,384
Conversations

2383
01:50:10,176 --> 01:50:10,688
Professor Zoom

2384
01:50:14,784 --> 01:50:15,552
Most

2385
01:50:15,808 --> 01:50:16,832
Biblical Scholars

2386
01:50:17,344 --> 01:50:17,856
Believe

2387
01:50:18,368 --> 01:50:19,392
Is that there are

2388
01:50:19,648 --> 01:50:20,160
Inflation's

2389
01:50:20,928 --> 01:50:24,000
This was

2390
01:50:24,512 --> 01:50:25,792
Crucified

2391
01:50:26,048 --> 01:50:27,840
Is not the same Jesus

2392
01:50:28,352 --> 01:50:29,888
Who said all the sayings

2393
01:50:30,400 --> 01:50:31,168
That are really popular

2394
01:50:31,424 --> 01:50:35,008
The Jesus who said all the sayings was a rabbi around that time

2395
01:50:38,336 --> 01:50:39,360
Would absolutely literal

2396
01:50:39,872 --> 01:50:41,664
Because

2397
01:50:41,920 --> 01:50:43,456
Crucified

2398
01:50:43,712 --> 01:50:45,760
Around that time

2399
01:50:46,272 --> 01:50:46,784
Was

2400
01:50:47,040 --> 01:50:48,064
A criminal

2401
01:50:49,088 --> 01:50:50,880
And throughout time those two

2402
01:50:51,136 --> 01:50:51,648
Persona

2403
01:50:51,904 --> 01:50:52,672
Have been Blended

2404
01:50:52,928 --> 01:50:55,744
I don't know if that's totally true

2405
01:50:56,000 --> 01:50:56,768
Just something that

2406
01:50:58,304 --> 01:50:59,328
Some of it was passed onto

2407
01:51:00,096 --> 01:51:00,864
By professor

2408
01:51:02,144 --> 01:51:02,912
Could be wrong

2409
01:51:05,472 --> 01:51:09,824
That's just what indications are because homeless people record around then

2410
01:51:10,080 --> 01:51:10,592
And all of

2411
01:51:12,640 --> 01:51:14,176
What's that in the Bible

2412
01:51:14,432 --> 01:51:15,200
Is them

2413
01:51:15,456 --> 01:51:16,992
Yeah it's not there isn't a ton

2414
01:51:17,760 --> 01:51:18,272
Matches up

2415
01:51:18,528 --> 01:51:19,296
So you have to sort of make

2416
01:51:20,320 --> 01:51:22,368
If you're reading the Dead Sea

2417
01:51:22,624 --> 01:51:24,160
These girls got to fill in gaps

2418
01:51:24,416 --> 01:51:25,696
And Scholars know how to do that

2419
01:51:25,952 --> 01:51:26,464
Much better than

2420
01:51:26,976 --> 01:51:29,792
Tim Horton's book about a guy

2421
01:51:30,048 --> 01:51:31,328
Several hundred years after he

2422
01:51:31,584 --> 01:51:32,096
He's already dead

2423
01:51:32,608 --> 01:51:33,632
You just started

2424
01:51:34,912 --> 01:51:36,448
Well I mean

2425
01:51:37,216 --> 01:51:40,032
So now important more importantly I think

2426
01:51:40,288 --> 01:51:42,080
I made the biggest

2427
01:51:42,848 --> 01:51:43,360
The fact that

2428
01:51:44,384 --> 01:51:45,152
None of these dudes

2429
01:51:45,920 --> 01:51:47,968
Are being like the apostles couldn't

2430
01:51:48,736 --> 01:51:49,504
Feel like that's just

2431
01:51:49,760 --> 01:51:50,272
The truth of

2432
01:51:50,528 --> 01:51:52,576
You would never you would never accept that

2433
01:51:53,344 --> 01:51:55,136
So many modern Christians today would

2434
01:51:55,392 --> 01:51:55,904
Never

2435
01:51:56,160 --> 01:51:59,744
Ever except that the apostles weren't anything other than

2436
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:03,072
The exemplary human beings of the day

2437
01:52:04,352 --> 01:52:08,960
Because we believe that literacy is the Norwegian

2438
01:52:11,520 --> 01:52:12,032
Just a bunch of

2439
01:52:12,800 --> 01:52:18,944
Everybody knows all those of the Epistles were written by all the Apostle make sense

2440
01:52:23,040 --> 01:52:23,552
No

2441
01:52:24,064 --> 01:52:26,880
Call the Whole Thing Off

2442
01:52:29,184 --> 01:52:30,208
Like a

2443
01:52:30,464 --> 01:52:31,488
Actual

2444
01:52:32,512 --> 01:52:33,024
Ridership

2445
01:52:33,280 --> 01:52:34,048
Open stuff like that is all

2446
01:52:36,864 --> 01:52:37,888
Juggling balls

2447
01:52:39,680 --> 01:52:40,192
Well you were

2448
01:52:40,704 --> 01:52:41,728
I on that wrist

2449
01:52:41,984 --> 01:52:42,496
You know like

2450
01:52:43,008 --> 01:52:49,152
Assume that literacy is so common now they must have always been

2451
01:52:49,408 --> 01:52:50,688
And it's not

2452
01:52:50,944 --> 01:52:51,712
Not now every

2453
01:52:54,528 --> 01:52:55,808
This up to again

2454
01:52:57,088 --> 01:52:58,624
You selling it as if it's like

2455
01:52:58,880 --> 01:53:05,024
A pure version of scripture

2456
01:53:08,608 --> 01:53:09,632

The Torah

2459
01:53:12,960 --> 01:53:16,288
Would you later grew to include many of the rest of what would be the old

2460
01:53:17,056 --> 01:53:19,104
Like Joshua Judges Ruth in the lake

2461
01:53:19,616 --> 01:53:21,664
It also contains books later sent to the suit

2462
01:53:21,920 --> 01:53:22,944

Furbies

2465
01:53:25,760 --> 01:53:26,784
The scepter game is nothing

2466
01:53:27,040 --> 01:53:27,808
Special release

2467
01:53:28,064 --> 01:53:29,856
Just a collection of translation of already exists

2468
01:53:30,112 --> 01:53:31,392
Religious texts and writing

2469
01:53:31,904 --> 01:53:34,464
That was a result of a project started in the proxy

2470
01:53:34,976 --> 01:53:36,256
300 BCE

2471
01:53:36,768 --> 01:53:37,792
Conclude around 1:30

2472
01:53:38,048 --> 01:53:38,560
2 BC

2473
01:53:39,328 --> 01:53:42,144
The name is derived from a story of how it came into being

2474
01:53:42,656 --> 01:53:44,448
Allegedly Ptolemy of Egypt

2475
01:53:44,704 --> 01:53:45,984
Progressive 72 rabbis

2476
01:53:46,496 --> 01:53:47,776
Translate their texts for him

2477
01:53:48,032 --> 01:53:48,800
Greek from the original

2478
01:53:49,056 --> 01:53:51,872
So he could have a copy in the Library of Alexandria

2479
01:53:52,640 --> 01:53:53,920
Magically because God

2480
01:53:54,176 --> 01:53:54,944

2482
01:53:56,480 --> 01:53:59,040
Independently created identical copies of the Translate

2483
01:53:59,808 --> 01:54:02,112
This story is generally thought by Scholars to be both

2484
01:54:02,880 --> 01:54:04,160
Give the traces back to

2485
01:54:04,416 --> 01:54:05,952
The letter of aristea

2486
01:54:06,464 --> 01:54:07,488
Which do today

2487
01:54:07,744 --> 01:54:08,256
Styles

2488
01:54:08,512 --> 01:54:11,840
Contextual Clues almost certainly could not have been written by the person who claims beer

2489
01:54:12,608 --> 01:54:16,448
Princeton Theological Seminary Professor Bruce Metzger describe the letter A

2490
01:54:17,472 --> 01:54:18,240
Most Scholars have

2491
01:54:18,496 --> 01:54:19,264
Vandalize the letters

2492
01:54:19,520 --> 01:54:20,288
Concluded that the author

2493
01:54:20,544 --> 01:54:21,824
Could not have been the Manny represented

2494
01:54:22,848 --> 01:54:24,384
But was a Jew who wrote it

2495
01:54:24,640 --> 01:54:25,664
Fictitious account in order

By suggesting that a pagan King

2499
01:54:30,784 --> 01:54:31,552
Is there significant

2500
01:54:31,808 --> 01:54:34,112
And therefore arranged for their translation into

2501
01:54:35,392 --> 01:54:35,904
So

2502
01:54:36,416 --> 01:54:36,928

They are coming

2514
01:54:55,104 --> 01:54:59,712
Based on the comments from way back then

2515
01:55:00,480 --> 01:55:00,992
A little bit

2516
01:55:03,040 --> 01:55:03,552
Really

2517
01:55:04,832 --> 01:55:06,112
What is Comic-Con

2518
01:55:06,368 --> 01:55:07,392
What do you mean they make

2519
01:55:08,672 --> 01:55:14,304
I don't know much more

2520
01:55:16,352 --> 01:55:17,376
I mean I think that distance

2521
01:55:17,632 --> 01:55:18,656
Right

2522
01:55:18,912 --> 01:55:20,960
Easier to see through Scientology than it is to

2523
01:55:21,216 --> 01:55:22,496
To see through Christianity

2524
01:55:23,008 --> 01:55:25,568

2526
01:55:31,712 --> 01:55:34,784
Stupid talking about aliens

2527
01:55:37,088 --> 01:55:38,624
How easy it is to

2528
01:55:39,136 --> 01:55:39,648
Jim Bakker

2529
01:55:40,928 --> 01:55:41,440
Some

2530
01:55:41,696 --> 01:55:45,024
Religious figure even in Christianity from 1700

2531
01:55:46,304 --> 01:55:47,072
So

Jordan

2533
01:55:48,096 --> 01:55:49,632
It is it's just interesting

2534
01:55:49,888 --> 01:55:51,424
It really is to know

2535
01:55:51,680 --> 01:55:52,704
VidCon

2536
01:55:53,216 --> 01:55:54,240
Has been going on

2537
01:55:54,496 --> 01:55:55,776
For thousands of years

2538
01:55:56,032 --> 01:55:57,056
It's the same fuc

2539
01:55:57,312 --> 01:56:01,664
Different angles

2540
01:56:01,920 --> 01:56:02,688
So now you're

2541
01:56:02,944 --> 01:56:05,248
There's various cons being played sort of

2542
01:56:05,504 --> 01:56:06,784
It's a cam that's evolved

2543
01:56:07,040 --> 01:56:10,112
But ultimately what it is is it's a short circuit

2544
01:56:10,368 --> 01:56:10,880
Of

2545
01:56:11,392 --> 01:56:12,160
The human brain

2546
01:56:14,464 --> 01:56:15,232
The human brain simple

2547
01:56:15,744 --> 01:56:16,256
Cannot get

2548
01:56:17,024 --> 01:56:18,304
And that's why this Con works

2549
01:56:19,328 --> 01:56:20,352
So you you

2550
01:56:20,608 --> 01:56:22,912
See so many people getting conned in the same way

2551
01:56:23,168 --> 01:56:24,448
And you can take comfort in the fact

2552
01:56:24,960 --> 01:56:25,472
People like this

2553
01:56:25,984 --> 01:56:26,752
Have been getting caught

2554
01:56:28,032 --> 01:56:28,800
Birth of humanity

2555
01:56:29,056 --> 01:56:30,336
And the con always

2556
01:56:30,848 --> 01:56:34,688
Ends up being about money

2557
01:56:35,968 --> 01:56:36,736
That's also true

2558
01:56:36,992 --> 01:56:39,552
Outback

2559
01:56:42,624 --> 01:56:45,184
Maybe I don't look

2560
01:56:45,440 --> 01:56:46,208
Putting that aside

2561
01:56:46,464 --> 01:56:51,840
The end of the last clip before we got off on that Jim doesn't understand that the apostles were illiterate and what the Septuagint

2562
01:56:55,168 --> 01:56:58,240
He said that 200,000 more dollars

2563
01:56:58,752 --> 01:57:00,544
To open Lori's house

2564
01:57:00,800 --> 01:57:06,432
EBay that harsh a won't even give them the go-ahead

2565
01:57:06,688 --> 01:57:07,968
And now that makes it

2566
01:57:08,224 --> 01:57:10,016
That much weirder than he says this

2567
01:57:11,040 --> 01:57:11,552
He starts preacher

2568
01:57:12,064 --> 01:57:13,856
Turn this track

2569
01:57:15,136 --> 01:57:16,160
Is really f***** up

2570
01:57:17,184 --> 01:57:17,952
Can you do that

2571
01:57:18,208 --> 01:57:20,512
You just talked about aliens portal

2572
01:57:21,024 --> 01:57:22,048
Demon reptiles

2573
01:57:22,304 --> 01:57:23,584
And then you're going to try and

2574
01:57:27,424 --> 01:57:28,448
It's more important

2575
01:57:28,704 --> 01:57:29,472
Very recent

2576
01:57:29,728 --> 01:57:31,520
A couple minutes earlier on the show

2577
01:57:31,776 --> 01:57:35,360
He was asking for $200,000 to finish Lori

2578
01:57:35,872 --> 01:57:37,408
The sun in the moon going to be dark

2579
01:57:38,432 --> 01:57:39,712
We are here now

2580
01:57:40,480 --> 01:57:42,016
And you must

2581
01:57:42,528 --> 01:57:43,040

A whole generation

2599

Anything else

2600
01:58:30,400 --> 01:58:31,168
Literally

2601
01:58:31,680 --> 01:58:33,216
Immature

2602
01:58:33,472 --> 01:58:34,240
In the last

2603
01:58:34,496 --> 01:58:35,520
Several decades

2604
01:58:36,032 --> 01:58:37,056
We have become

2605
01:58:37,312 --> 01:58:38,336
Lovers

2606
01:58:38,592 --> 01:58:41,920
And the Bible says

2607
01:58:42,432 --> 01:58:44,224
The root of all evil

2608
01:58:44,736 --> 01:58:46,016
Is the Love of Money

2609
01:58:47,552 --> 01:58:48,832
Change

2610
01:58:50,112 --> 01:58:51,904
We have another gospel

2611
01:58:52,672 --> 01:58:57,792
The real gospel nobody really wants it

2612
01:58:59,840 --> 01:59:01,632
Rough start right there

2613
01:59:03,936 --> 01:59:04,960
That is the most

2614
01:59:05,216 --> 01:59:11,360
That is if you are not going to say this as soon as I am that is the most Alex Jones being thing that he could ever have.

2615
01:59:11,872 --> 01:59:16,992
It is first thing he says

2616
01:59:17,248 --> 01:59:17,760
Right

2617
01:59:18,016 --> 01:59:18,528
You can't

2618
01:59:18,784 --> 01:59:22,624
Trust anybody unless you go verify it in the Bible

2619
01:59:22,880 --> 01:59:25,440
Now of course I'm telling you it so you don't need to go

2620
01:59:25,696 --> 01:59:29,536
Check out multiple times on this episode said things that are

2621
01:59:29,792 --> 01:59:31,328
Chris biblically

2622
01:59:31,584 --> 01:59:34,400
Because I said them and then because I told you

2623
01:59:34,656 --> 01:59:39,264
You to go check whether or not I said them you can trust that I am confident

2624
01:59:39,520 --> 01:59:40,288
That you will

2625
01:59:40,800 --> 01:59:44,128
Go check what I say

2626
01:59:44,384 --> 01:59:47,968
Because we both know that you already checked what I say even though you didn't need to

2627
01:59:49,504 --> 01:59:50,016
Maybe second

2628
01:59:50,272 --> 01:59:52,064
Nothing I would point out about that click

2629
01:59:53,600 --> 01:59:55,136
Then we get to the money part

2630
01:59:55,392 --> 01:59:57,184
That's crazy

2631
01:59:57,440 --> 02:00:00,512
Is a Alex Jones to the f******

2632
02:00:02,304 --> 02:00:03,072
F****** prison

2633
02:00:05,632 --> 02:00:06,656
All people

2634
02:00:06,912 --> 02:00:07,936
These days is money

2635
02:00:13,056 --> 02:00:16,384
With their money-grubbing all they want is money

2636
02:00:16,640 --> 02:00:19,712
Most of them haven't gone to prison for fraud

2637
02:00:19,968 --> 02:00:22,272
They want the money I'd

2638
02:00:22,528 --> 02:00:24,064
Just have to live in their world

2639
02:00:24,576 --> 02:00:27,136
I know how to live in their world because the Bible told me

2640
02:00:27,392 --> 02:00:28,672
To take their money

2641
02:00:28,928 --> 02:00:31,744
And you don't even need to check on that because you can read it

2642
02:00:32,000 --> 02:00:38,144
But like in the church for the last couple decades

2643
02:00:38,400 --> 02:00:39,680
People who are into money

2644
02:00:41,984 --> 02:00:45,056
A couple technical G went to prison for that

2645
02:00:45,568 --> 02:00:48,128
Don't bring up yourself

2646
02:00:48,384 --> 02:00:54,528
The Prosperity Gospel you have on your truck

2647
02:00:57,856 --> 02:01:04,000
Very clearly to Prosperity Gospel

2648
02:01:04,256 --> 02:01:04,768
You are but what am I

2649
02:01:08,096 --> 02:01:10,144
It's crazy to me like what are you

2650
02:01:10,400 --> 02:01:11,168
Saying

2651
02:01:11,424 --> 02:01:11,936
Now

2652
02:01:13,216 --> 02:01:13,984
That regard

2653
02:01:14,240 --> 02:01:15,776
Based on what you just said

2654
02:01:16,288 --> 02:01:17,824
Please accept me when I say

2655
02:01:18,080 --> 02:01:19,360
If you buy that s*** your

2656
02:01:21,664 --> 02:01:23,968
In your life

2657
02:01:24,736 --> 02:01:25,248
Way

2658
02:01:26,016 --> 02:01:29,088
If you're not like if you don't have that phone have a second of like

2659
02:01:29,600 --> 02:01:30,880
Maybe this time

2660
02:01:31,648 --> 02:01:32,928
You know what I say

2661
02:01:33,184 --> 02:01:33,696
Disgaea

2662
02:01:33,952 --> 02:01:34,464
F******

2663
02:01:34,720 --> 02:01:38,816
Clearly loves money kind of loves money

2664
02:01:39,072 --> 02:01:41,376
200 g for faucets

2665
02:01:41,632 --> 02:01:44,704
And then bitched about how everybody else was all about money

2666
02:01:44,960 --> 02:01:48,544
Weird weird

2667
02:01:50,336 --> 02:01:51,104
The very

2668
02:01:52,640 --> 02:01:54,688
The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse really

2669
02:01:57,760 --> 02:01:58,784
Is there going to be

2670
02:02:00,320 --> 02:02:00,832
By the

2671
02:02:01,088 --> 02:02:04,672
Disease from the animals what is HIV a where does it come from

2672
02:02:04,928 --> 02:02:05,952
Awesome animals

2673
02:02:07,232 --> 02:02:08,512
Animal

2674
02:02:09,280 --> 02:02:10,304
What's iPod

2675
02:02:10,560 --> 02:02:11,328
We're going to kill people

2676
02:02:13,376 --> 02:02:14,400
But it was

2677
02:02:14,656 --> 02:02:15,680
One word

2678
02:02:16,192 --> 02:02:17,984
What's wrong

2679
02:02:19,264 --> 02:02:22,080
And we have a lot of

2680
02:02:22,592 --> 02:02:24,128
I don't understand what that means but it's

2681
02:02:24,384 --> 02:02:25,664
Not that important

2682
02:02:25,920 --> 02:02:31,808
It's so weird

2683
02:02:32,064 --> 02:02:34,880
I can tell you that what he said before that clip started.

2684
02:02:35,136 --> 02:02:36,672
I've no idea

2685
02:02:36,928 --> 02:02:38,208
Hold on hold on

2686
02:02:38,720 --> 02:02:44,864
We are people trying to say the bubble God wants you to be rich I do I bore you with that thought but it's

2687
02:02:54,336 --> 02:02:55,616
Want you to be rich

2688
02:02:56,384 --> 02:02:56,896
Right

2689
02:02:57,152 --> 02:02:58,432
Holyshit

2690
02:02:58,688 --> 02:02:59,712
What the f*** is happened

2691
02:02:59,968 --> 02:03:06,112
That's going off the rails now

2692
02:03:06,368 --> 02:03:06,880
Him to get into heaven

2693
02:03:08,672 --> 02:03:12,000
That is just fact the Bible says that pretend

2694
02:03:12,256 --> 02:03:12,768
Please why

2695
02:03:13,024 --> 02:03:15,072
$200,000

2696
02:03:15,840 --> 02:03:16,608
F****** sinks

2697
02:03:17,120 --> 02:03:18,656
Do you understand that what he's doing is

2698
02:03:18,912 --> 02:03:19,424
Is he

2699
02:03:19,936 --> 02:03:20,704
Basically

2700
02:03:21,472 --> 02:03:22,240
Refuting

2701
02:03:23,008 --> 02:03:24,288
A lot of the

2702
02:03:24,544 --> 02:03:25,312
The ideas that he

2703
02:03:25,824 --> 02:03:27,616
The General

2704
02:03:27,872 --> 02:03:32,992
It's a seed you're planting you give me money at the end

2705
02:03:33,248 --> 02:03:36,320
He's refusing to be rich

2706
02:03:36,832 --> 02:03:38,112
You should give all the money here

2707
02:03:38,624 --> 02:03:41,952
It's got to be better that way it makes me feel like he's in

2708
02:03:42,208 --> 02:03:42,720
Trouble

2709
02:03:44,768 --> 02:03:47,072
Like maybe he doesn't need that 20,000

2710
02:03:47,328 --> 02:03:47,840
For the snakes

2711
02:03:48,352 --> 02:03:49,632
Maybe he owes back taxes

2712
02:03:49,888 --> 02:03:51,168
Is there something like that

2713
02:03:51,424 --> 02:03:55,264
Miles

2714
02:03:55,776 --> 02:03:57,056
He's not a he's not a church

2715
02:03:57,568 --> 02:03:58,592
He still got it

2716
02:03:58,848 --> 02:03:59,616
No he's still got it

2717
02:04:00,896 --> 02:04:01,920
I didn't know what he gets

2718
02:04:02,176 --> 02:04:03,200
Tax exempt status

2719
02:04:03,712 --> 02:04:05,760
Man it would be wild if he was

2720
02:04:06,016 --> 02:04:09,344
Prison for fraud

2721
02:04:09,600 --> 02:04:10,112
Exempt status

2722
02:04:11,136 --> 02:04:11,648
Churches

2723
02:04:11,904 --> 02:04:13,952
Very political profit-based

2724
02:04:15,744 --> 02:04:21,888
Go to same thing with that Courtney Brown with the Pharcyde

2725
02:04:23,424 --> 02:04:25,728
Right

2726
02:04:25,984 --> 02:04:28,032
I love that we've added Jim Bakker

2727
02:04:28,544 --> 02:04:29,056
Because

2728
02:04:29,568 --> 02:04:31,104
Jim Bakker is the pretzel

2729
02:04:38,272 --> 02:04:38,784
Did Alex and Kara

2730
02:04:39,296 --> 02:04:41,344
Right bro answer me Alex is

2731
02:04:41,600 --> 02:04:43,648
Alex is so Money Motivated

2732
02:04:44,160 --> 02:04:45,696
That is kind of boring is there

2733
02:04:46,208 --> 02:04:51,072
And Carrie Carrie is Money Motivated but she also has a little bit more of that Love of the Game

2734
02:04:54,144 --> 02:04:56,704
She like being wild for being wild say

2735
02:04:56,960 --> 02:05:03,104
Jim Bakker is the perfect mix of the two that is the most hungry no money-grubbing man and at the same time

2736
02:05:03,360 --> 02:05:09,248
F*** yeah let's talk about reptoids disagree

2737
02:05:10,272 --> 02:05:11,552
The thing is

2738
02:05:11,808 --> 02:05:12,832
What time

2739
02:05:13,344 --> 02:05:14,112
I don't know this is

2740
02:05:15,904 --> 02:05:17,696
I don't like a lot of Wes Anderson

2741
02:05:21,536 --> 02:05:22,816
Too cute

2742
02:05:23,072 --> 02:05:28,448
All of these are fair criticism I don't like the idea of them children act like adults I think that's

2743
02:05:28,704 --> 02:05:29,984
Stupid

2744
02:05:30,240 --> 02:05:30,752
Whatever

2745
02:05:32,288 --> 02:05:35,872
Be that as it may one time I was talking to my brother about it and he

2746
02:05:36,128 --> 02:05:37,664
You said

2747
02:05:37,920 --> 02:05:39,456
He really appreciates when you look at the

2748
02:05:39,712 --> 02:05:40,480
The bigger body

2749
02:05:41,760 --> 02:05:43,808
His work is that most of the movies

2750
02:05:44,320 --> 02:05:46,624
You could take them and they embody the

2751
02:05:46,880 --> 02:05:47,904
Spirit of being assertive

2752
02:05:48,928 --> 02:05:49,440
So you take

2753
02:05:49,696 --> 02:05:50,720
Like

2754
02:05:52,768 --> 02:05:56,864
Give me the movie I'll tell you that

2755
02:05:57,120 --> 02:06:00,192
You're at

2756
02:06:02,752 --> 02:06:04,032
Like aimless 20s

2757
02:06:04,288 --> 02:06:06,336
Okay we're like I should have amounted to something

2758
02:06:07,360 --> 02:06:11,456
Calm and you did sort of struggling through a cloud maybe I'll become a bank robber

2759
02:06:13,504 --> 02:06:14,016
Maybe pop

2760
02:06:14,272 --> 02:06:17,344
Possible that's the life for you and you entertained

2761
02:06:17,600 --> 02:06:18,880
Stupid possibilities

2762
02:06:19,904 --> 02:06:20,416
Spiritism

2763
02:06:20,672 --> 02:06:23,232
Captured all right

2764
02:06:23,488 --> 02:06:24,768
Moonrise Kingdom is when

2765
02:06:25,024 --> 02:06:29,632
You are like 12 and you fall in love with somebody and it seems so epic

2766
02:06:29,888 --> 02:06:30,912
When it's really not

2767
02:06:31,168 --> 02:06:33,728
Play out the theme of it being like

2768
02:06:33,984 --> 02:06:38,848
This profound beautiful things you have to fight for in reality it's not

2769
02:06:39,104 --> 02:06:39,872
It's the idea of your fur

2770
02:06:40,128 --> 02:06:40,640
First love

2771
02:06:40,896 --> 02:06:46,272
Is embodied in Moonrise Kingdom early childhood

2772
02:06:46,784 --> 02:06:49,344
It's sort of like a

2773
02:06:49,600 --> 02:06:54,464
Kind of don't buy

2774
02:06:57,536 --> 02:06:58,816
And also

2775
02:06:59,328 --> 02:07:05,472
And also this. Was this theory was Pitch to me before that came out

2776
02:07:05,984 --> 02:07:12,128
Do we have a prepared Royal Tenenbaums

2777
02:07:12,384 --> 02:07:18,528
And your parents get old and die

2778
02:07:18,784 --> 02:07:22,368
Your whole life has become like the disillusionment of

2779
02:07:22,624 --> 02:07:23,648
The past generation

2780
02:07:23,904 --> 02:07:26,208
I mean the the the life

2781
02:07:26,464 --> 02:07:26,976
Aquatica

2782
02:07:27,232 --> 02:07:32,352
When you come to the end of your career and you realize you're no longer useful in the way that you used to be

2783
02:07:32,608 --> 02:07:34,144
That sort of struggle

2784
02:07:34,400 --> 02:07:36,192
To each of his movies have like this

2785
02:07:36,448 --> 02:07:36,960
Profound

2786
02:07:37,472 --> 02:07:40,544
Not right of passage necessarily but this Pivot Point

2787
02:07:40,800 --> 02:07:41,568
In people's lives

2788
02:07:41,824 --> 02:07:43,104
Profound

2789
02:07:43,360 --> 02:07:43,872
Moments

2790
02:07:44,896 --> 02:07:45,664
Allowed me to approach

2791
02:07:45,920 --> 02:07:48,736
Appreciate some of the movies more away that you didn't

2792
02:07:51,040 --> 02:07:52,576
Watching of the movie your kind of like

2793
02:07:52,832 --> 02:07:53,344
This is webull

2794
02:07:53,600 --> 02:07:58,720
I hated them but I didn't like them that much

2795
02:08:00,768 --> 02:08:03,328
Long winded as hell is that I think we have

2796
02:08:05,120 --> 02:08:06,912
Different periods in a propagandist

2797
02:08:07,168 --> 02:08:07,680
Career

2798
02:08:08,192 --> 02:08:09,728
Depicted by these three

2799
02:08:09,984 --> 02:08:12,544
You just had that all together

2800
02:08:12,800 --> 02:08:13,824
We have Carrie who

2801
02:08:14,080 --> 02:08:20,224
I mean in there all probably around the same

2802
02:08:20,480 --> 02:08:23,808
Bakery

2803
02:08:24,064 --> 02:08:25,344
How old is Jim Bakker

2804
02:08:25,856 --> 02:08:27,904
Methuselah is a million years old

2805
02:08:28,160 --> 02:08:30,720
Bright that guy's going to be calling long after we're dead

2806
02:08:31,744 --> 02:08:33,280
Presumably 45

2807
02:08:34,816 --> 02:08:36,352
Whatever.

2808
02:08:36,864 --> 02:08:39,424
Gary's R50 probably in Baker 7

2809
02:08:39,680 --> 02:08:40,960
Age of side

2810
02:08:41,216 --> 02:08:42,752
You have Carrie still

2811
02:08:43,520 --> 02:08:47,104
Searching for the truth

2812
02:08:50,432 --> 02:08:51,200
You have Carrie at

2813
02:08:51,712 --> 02:08:52,224
He's crazy

2814
02:08:52,480 --> 02:08:53,504
And still like

2815
02:08:53,760 --> 02:08:54,528
I will talk to

2816
02:08:54,784 --> 02:08:58,112
Like I texted you earlier I listen to

2817
02:08:59,392 --> 02:09:00,160
The dishwasher

2818
02:09:02,208 --> 02:09:03,488
Why would you do that

2819
02:09:03,744 --> 02:09:04,512
You're f****** hungry

2820
02:09:04,768 --> 02:09:07,840
And you're hoping that he's not lying for the

2821
02:09:08,352 --> 02:09:09,632
That's a big swing

2822
02:09:09,888 --> 02:09:14,496
You're going to miss most of the time but a couple times going to be home run

2823
02:09:14,752 --> 02:09:18,336
Willing to cut

2824
02:09:18,592 --> 02:09:20,128
Then you got Alex Jones

2825
02:09:20,384 --> 02:09:21,152
Who is just like

2826
02:09:21,664 --> 02:09:22,944
I'm in the middle of this

2827
02:09:23,456 --> 02:09:23,968
I've made some

2828
02:09:24,224 --> 02:09:24,736
Some mistakes

2829
02:09:24,992 --> 02:09:25,760
Imma s*******

2830
02:09:26,016 --> 02:09:26,528
Whatever

2831
02:09:27,040 --> 02:09:28,064
I don't care I don't care

2832
02:09:28,320 --> 02:09:30,112
I fallen in with the wrong crowd

2833
02:09:30,368 --> 02:09:31,648
I'm in the middle of this

2834
02:09:31,904 --> 02:09:32,672
I'll try it

2835
02:09:32,928 --> 02:09:35,488
And probably get Redemption later

2836
02:09:35,744 --> 02:09:39,584
Currently resign he's like I am this is my

2837
02:09:39,840 --> 02:09:41,376
And I am resigned to

2838
02:09:41,632 --> 02:09:44,192
And then Baker is the guy who's

2839
02:09:44,960 --> 02:09:50,336
DD's over the hill he's still just doing this because it's what he knows how to do

2840
02:09:50,592 --> 02:09:56,736
Good attitude if you go to prison for and then go back to doing it

2841
02:09:57,248 --> 02:09:58,272
Yes

2842
02:09:58,528 --> 02:10:04,672
Exactly what that's the only thing I know is late career he's the Steve's

2843
02:10:04,928 --> 02:10:06,208
Yuzu of the con

2844
02:10:06,464 --> 02:10:07,744
Not bad would bring it back

2845
02:10:08,000 --> 02:10:10,304
So there is that right

2846
02:10:10,560 --> 02:10:11,072
Appreciate that

2847
02:10:11,328 --> 02:10:13,376
Picture of these people that like

2848
02:10:13,632 --> 02:10:14,144
Different

2849
02:10:14,400 --> 02:10:16,960
Stages of the con

2850
02:10:17,216 --> 02:10:22,080
The life of the car

2851
02:10:22,336 --> 02:10:28,480
Is a pecan

2852
02:10:28,992 --> 02:10:34,368
There's a to-do list

2853
02:10:34,880 --> 02:10:38,720
Yeah that's true I want a young man who's got

2854
02:10:38,976 --> 02:10:40,000
Castellan a message of

2855
02:10:40,256 --> 02:10:41,792
Hope it's hard it's hard to find

2856
02:10:42,048 --> 02:10:46,912
Cuz all of the young cons now or all about

2857
02:10:47,936 --> 02:10:49,728
Get them fired from Disney or whatever the

2858
02:10:50,496 --> 02:10:51,520
They do.

2859
02:10:51,776 --> 02:10:52,800
The twisting of the

2860
02:10:53,312 --> 02:10:53,824
Is really hurt

2861
02:10:54,080 --> 02:10:54,592
The convent

2862
02:10:55,616 --> 02:10:59,712
Has become almost a magnet for those people

2863
02:10:59,968 --> 02:11:00,992
To get your s*** not hard

2864
02:11:01,248 --> 02:11:02,528
Get your s*** reposted like

2865
02:11:02,784 --> 02:11:05,344
My crazy ass say the right inflammatory

2866
02:11:05,600 --> 02:11:06,624
I'm so these people

2867
02:11:06,880 --> 02:11:08,672
Very easy like if you are a Converse

2868
02:11:09,184 --> 02:11:11,488
You're obviously more motivated by

2869
02:11:11,744 --> 02:11:12,256
Publicity

2870
02:11:12,512 --> 02:11:15,328
Yeah I'm motivated by traction than you are from actually

2871
02:11:15,584 --> 02:11:16,352
Substance

2872
02:11:16,608 --> 02:11:22,752
So we are like the the Fox News 21 year olds like Laura Loomer

2873
02:11:23,008 --> 02:11:24,032
Or something like that

2874
02:11:24,288 --> 02:11:30,432
What are what are the ones that are like

2875
02:11:31,456 --> 02:11:37,344
I don't even know their name Lorraine

2876
02:11:38,112 --> 02:11:38,880
Just a talking head on

2877
02:11:39,136 --> 02:11:42,464
She couldn't do it her on her own

2878
02:11:42,976 --> 02:11:45,536
You can say like a Ben Shapiro or something

2879
02:11:49,888 --> 02:11:53,472
Yeah he doesn't he's not he's not playing the exact same game

2880
02:11:53,984 --> 02:11:56,288
Other difficulties to that like

2881
02:11:58,080 --> 02:12:03,456
Jalen Jordan rate whether or not somebody could become a good kind they have the chops

2882
02:12:04,480 --> 02:12:06,784
I think I don't know man like there is

2883
02:12:08,064 --> 02:12:08,576
Looking at

2884
02:12:09,088 --> 02:12:10,624
People who come up on in Fort Worth

2885
02:12:10,880 --> 02:12:11,392
From time to time

2886
02:12:12,160 --> 02:12:13,184
Anybody got

2887
02:12:13,440 --> 02:12:16,768
The goods Shroyer doesn't have now

2888
02:12:18,048 --> 02:12:20,096
If there's anybody who he's had on his like

2889
02:12:22,144 --> 02:12:25,984
Do you think it might be a problem I think is important is

2890
02:12:26,240 --> 02:12:26,752
If you're going to

2891
02:12:27,008 --> 02:12:29,056
Become a legit person

2892
02:12:29,568 --> 02:12:32,128
In the vein of the the trio that we talk

2893
02:12:32,384 --> 02:12:34,176
About one of the most important pieces

2894
02:12:34,688 --> 02:12:35,712
You need a backup

2895
02:12:36,224 --> 02:12:36,736
Support system

2896
02:12:36,992 --> 02:12:39,552
Yeah so far carry it's people like Mark Richards

2897
02:12:39,808 --> 02:12:45,952
People like a weirdo from England to Banks around with an alien in Alien

2898
02:12:49,024 --> 02:12:49,792
Alex

2899
02:12:50,048 --> 02:12:53,376
Now Rodger stone for that Larry Nichols

2900
02:12:54,400 --> 02:12:55,424
Gerald Celente

2901
02:12:55,680 --> 02:12:56,192
All these guys

2902
02:12:56,448 --> 02:12:58,752
Robert

2903
02:12:59,008 --> 02:13:01,056
All these weird Prosperity Gospel preachers

2904
02:13:01,568 --> 02:13:03,872
The come in like the Tom Horn

2905
02:13:06,176 --> 02:13:06,688
Siri

2906
02:13:06,944 --> 02:13:08,736
Generation of the con

2907
02:13:10,272 --> 02:13:15,648
Our generation of the con

2908
02:13:16,160 --> 02:13:20,256
Like it's a it's a collective mind it's a hive Minecon

2909
02:13:20,512 --> 02:13:21,536
That's who's coming up

2910
02:13:21,792 --> 02:13:23,328
It's the 14 and 15 year olds

2911
02:13:23,584 --> 02:13:26,912
It's a 25 year old or 35 year old girl

2912
02:13:27,168 --> 02:13:33,312
Pretending their fourteen-year-old

2913
02:13:33,568 --> 02:13:34,592
And they all Amplified together

2914
02:13:35,104 --> 02:13:36,384
Nearest Walgreens

2915
02:13:36,640 --> 02:13:37,664
Same charismatic

2916
02:13:38,688 --> 02:13:40,736
Charismatic leaders are going to be

2917
02:13:40,992 --> 02:13:41,504
On the other side

2918
02:13:41,760 --> 02:13:45,088
Or is it because of what I was talking about earlier with the mag

2919
02:13:45,344 --> 02:13:47,136
Amortization of all this to the right

2920
02:13:47,648 --> 02:13:49,184
Not happening towards

2921
02:13:49,440 --> 02:13:51,232
I have people on the left or Connie

2922
02:13:52,000 --> 02:13:53,024
Presumably

2923
02:13:53,280 --> 02:13:54,304
Ostensibly

2924
02:13:54,560 --> 02:13:55,328
People like to Louise Mensch

2925
02:14:02,752 --> 02:14:03,264
The left

2926
02:14:03,776 --> 02:14:05,056
I don't think there is

2927
02:14:05,824 --> 02:14:07,104
I don't think there are valid

2928
02:14:08,640 --> 02:14:10,688
Media folks on the left who are doing

2929
02:14:12,224 --> 02:14:15,040
Is it is it work I think there are Fringe voice

2930
02:14:16,576 --> 02:14:17,088
But like

2931
02:14:17,344 --> 02:14:20,672
But if you're on the left

2932
02:14:21,696 --> 02:14:23,744
Lexicon is ultimately a right-wing

2933
02:14:24,256 --> 02:14:26,304
The cam is always AIDS

2934
02:14:26,816 --> 02:14:27,840
Nobody

2935
02:14:28,096 --> 02:14:29,632
Connor's always I'm going to

2936
02:14:29,888 --> 02:14:31,168
Convince you to act

2937
02:14:31,680 --> 02:14:32,448
Your own interest

2938
02:14:32,704 --> 02:14:34,752
By making you think that your interest

2939
02:14:36,032 --> 02:14:36,544
The interest

2940
02:14:37,568 --> 02:14:38,848
Sure

2941
02:14:39,104 --> 02:14:43,456
So like if you want to go with your you're like Alexandra

2942
02:14:43,712 --> 02:14:49,856
She is not your Cortez f****** con the s*** out of people but she's on the left and so her I

2943
02:14:50,112 --> 02:14:50,624
Idea is

2944
02:14:50,880 --> 02:14:51,904
I'm going to take your

2945
02:14:52,672 --> 02:14:54,208
And I'm going to make them my in

2946
02:14:54,720 --> 02:14:57,024
And that's where all going to be moving forward

2947
02:14:57,792 --> 02:14:59,072
The reason that I have paws

2948
02:15:00,096 --> 02:15:01,120
Always been

2949
02:15:01,632 --> 02:15:03,168
Tableau

2950
02:15:07,008 --> 02:15:07,520
Yeah

2951
02:15:07,776 --> 02:15:10,848
Don't extrapolate

2952
02:15:13,664 --> 02:15:14,176
5 years

2953
02:15:14,688 --> 02:15:15,456
That might not have been

2954
02:15:16,224 --> 02:15:19,552
You know what I mean yours on the left

2955
02:15:19,808 --> 02:15:20,320
You were trying to make

2956
02:15:20,576 --> 02:15:21,088
Michelada

2957
02:15:22,368 --> 02:15:24,928
And a lot of them do that they aren't there more in Trench

2958
02:15:25,184 --> 02:15:25,696
Winston like Mega

2959
02:15:28,000 --> 02:15:31,584
They don't have radio shows

2960
02:15:32,096 --> 02:15:32,864
But that's probably

2961
02:15:33,120 --> 02:15:33,632
Just because

2962
02:15:33,888 --> 02:15:35,168
That's where they got a gig

2963
02:15:36,448 --> 02:15:37,728
As opposed to the right-wing

2964
02:15:38,240 --> 02:15:39,264
Is so entrenched

2965
02:15:41,312 --> 02:15:42,080
Through the Koch brothers

2966
02:15:43,872 --> 02:15:44,640
I don't know it

2967
02:15:45,152 --> 02:15:50,784
That's an interesting conversation for another day hours

2968
02:15:54,880 --> 02:15:58,464
I think a little bit but we can't because you're you're

2969
02:15:58,720 --> 02:16:00,256
You're right in a way that I wasn't

2970
02:16:00,512 --> 02:16:01,024
Expecting

2971
02:16:01,280 --> 02:16:01,792
Not like

2972
02:16:02,048 --> 02:16:03,328
Think you're Dumber wrong

2973
02:16:03,584 --> 02:16:04,096
I do

2974
02:16:04,608 --> 02:16:06,400
There's something to be said for that

2975
02:16:06,656 --> 02:16:07,680
The idea of the crowdsourcing

2976
02:16:08,960 --> 02:16:10,240
In terms of these message

2977
02:16:12,800 --> 02:16:14,080
In reality

2978
02:16:14,592 --> 02:16:15,104
Is

2979
02:16:16,384 --> 02:16:17,408
There will rise

2980
02:16:18,688 --> 02:16:20,224
Some other Khan

2981
02:16:21,504 --> 02:16:22,016
YouTube

2982
02:16:23,808 --> 02:16:24,576
Form I don't know

2983
02:16:24,832 --> 02:16:26,880
Could be could make his own channel or some

2984
02:16:27,136 --> 02:16:28,928
Something like that is a damn prophecy is what this is

2985
02:16:29,952 --> 02:16:35,072
Probably the most natural progression history right you have

2986
02:16:35,584 --> 02:16:39,168
Examples of people like Mike Stern

2987
02:16:41,216 --> 02:16:43,264
There will be someone who creates their own thing

2988
02:16:44,288 --> 02:16:45,568
And it won't be that

2989
02:16:45,824 --> 02:16:46,336
The 4chan

2990
02:16:46,592 --> 02:16:47,104
The Reddit

2991
02:16:47,360 --> 02:16:48,640
All that stuff all that crowd

2992
02:16:49,408 --> 02:16:52,224
Will be the con

2993
02:16:52,736 --> 02:16:53,760
Unnamed

2994
02:16:54,016 --> 02:16:54,784
The backdrop

2995
02:16:55,040 --> 02:16:57,600
For the con

2996
02:16:57,856 --> 02:16:58,624
That'll be your pretend

2997
02:16:59,136 --> 02:16:59,904
Xavier Stone

2998
02:17:00,160 --> 02:17:00,672
Exactly

2999
02:17:00,928 --> 02:17:04,512
But the problem is that in the reason why I think that is a Unser

3000
02:17:04,768 --> 02:17:05,536
Sustainable economy

3001
02:17:06,048 --> 02:17:06,816
Is because

3002
02:17:07,584 --> 02:17:08,608
What makes it work

3003
02:17:08,864 --> 02:17:09,376
With Patron

3004
02:17:09,888 --> 02:17:11,424
What makes it work with Rodger Stone

3005
02:17:11,936 --> 02:17:12,448
Is that

3006
02:17:12,960 --> 02:17:14,240
They will show their face and

3007
02:17:14,496 --> 02:17:17,056
And talk right they will be on the show and say things

3008
02:17:17,568 --> 02:17:18,592
That Alex can use

3009
02:17:19,872 --> 02:17:23,712
This is this is evidence of where is it rabbit message board

3010
02:17:25,248 --> 02:17:26,016
Again you're right

3011
02:17:26,528 --> 02:17:27,808
Creating samsic face

3012
02:17:28,320 --> 02:17:30,880
Right you can't really bring them on his guests

3013
02:17:31,136 --> 02:17:31,648
Unless you just

3014
02:17:32,160 --> 02:17:33,184
Kamal anonymous

3015
02:17:33,440 --> 02:17:35,488
Representatives Brenda and that doesn't

3016
02:17:35,744 --> 02:17:39,072
Carry the same weight but that's when we start getting into

3017
02:17:41,888 --> 02:17:47,520
I would say so

3018
02:17:53,920 --> 02:17:54,432
Fair enough

3019
02:18:04,928 --> 02:18:11,072
What's a hundred percent bail myself out about the connection here maker

3020
02:18:12,096 --> 02:18:16,448
I mean the most popular

3021
02:18:16,704 --> 02:18:19,520
Version of rhizome Theory

3022
02:18:20,544 --> 02:18:21,568
Like ghosts in the shop

3023
02:18:22,080 --> 02:18:22,592
Like that kind

3024
02:18:23,360 --> 02:18:25,408
Out of the out of the

3025
02:18:25,664 --> 02:18:27,200
Out of Fortune

3026
02:18:27,456 --> 02:18:27,968
Out of this

3027
02:18:28,224 --> 02:18:29,504
Nebulous Mass

3028
02:18:29,760 --> 02:18:30,272
Hive mind

3029
02:18:30,784 --> 02:18:31,808
Will come a

3030
02:18:32,064 --> 02:18:32,576
Represent

3031
02:18:35,136 --> 02:18:36,928
Qanon

3032
02:18:37,184 --> 02:18:40,256
But but there will be a person who is the embodiment

3033
02:18:40,768 --> 02:18:41,536
Of this Kuna

3034
02:18:42,048 --> 02:18:42,560
Who

3035
02:18:42,816 --> 02:18:46,144
Well that will happen once we're able to really protect this

3036
02:18:48,192 --> 02:18:49,472
Facial

3037
02:18:50,496 --> 02:18:53,568
Like

3038
02:18:54,080 --> 02:18:55,616
Pacino movie

3039
02:18:55,872 --> 02:18:56,896
Like that Al Pacino

3040
02:18:57,152 --> 02:19:00,480
There we go

3041
02:19:02,016 --> 02:19:06,112
Alright alright

3042
02:19:06,624 --> 02:19:08,928
Look at that

3043
02:19:11,232 --> 02:19:13,024
Where we talked

3044
02:19:14,048 --> 02:19:18,656
What is mostly move faster

3045
02:19:23,520 --> 02:19:24,800
Went off on that too

3046
02:19:25,312 --> 02:19:25,824
Dude

3047
02:19:26,080 --> 02:19:26,848
Jim Bakker

3048
02:19:33,760 --> 02:19:35,808
Archetypical example of someone

3049
02:19:36,064 --> 02:19:37,856
Using religion to make money

3050
02:19:38,112 --> 02:19:40,160
You coming on and being like

3051
02:19:44,000 --> 02:19:45,280
Doing it

3052
02:19:45,536 --> 02:19:49,120
You are the archetypical example because of when he went to prison

3053
02:19:49,376 --> 02:19:49,888
And now you're

3054
02:19:50,144 --> 02:19:53,728
Still doing it baby and that's why that one

3055
02:19:53,984 --> 02:20:00,128
If it weren't for you you were the Trailblazer

3056
02:20:04,736 --> 02:20:07,552
You f****** a******

3057
02:20:08,320 --> 02:20:10,112
I don't know why I need to extend

3058
02:20:10,624 --> 02:20:11,392
Did the con

3059
02:20:12,672 --> 02:20:13,952
Paula White

3060
02:20:14,208 --> 02:20:14,720
Cool

3061
02:20:14,976 --> 02:20:19,072
A really polite team

3062
02:20:19,328 --> 02:20:20,096
With the con

3063
02:20:20,608 --> 02:20:21,120
In many ways

3064
02:20:22,144 --> 02:20:22,656
Prosperity

3065
02:20:22,912 --> 02:20:23,680
Ross.

3066
02:20:23,936 --> 02:20:24,704
Work yourself

3067
02:20:24,960 --> 02:20:25,728
Into

3068
02:20:25,984 --> 02:20:26,752
The presidents

3069
02:20:27,264 --> 02:20:27,776
Thought year

3070
02:20:30,080 --> 02:20:30,592
She's not doing

3071
02:20:31,104 --> 02:20:31,616
Conwright

3072
02:20:32,128 --> 02:20:33,152
Because before

3073
02:20:33,664 --> 02:20:34,688
We did that at

3074
02:20:34,944 --> 02:20:36,992
So you had no idea who she was

3075
02:20:37,248 --> 02:20:42,624
What you think most of our listeners had no idea I was like

3076
02:20:42,880 --> 02:20:43,392
She's a

3077
02:20:43,648 --> 02:20:46,464
I didn't know who she was until you said

3078
02:20:46,720 --> 02:20:48,256
She's purple into the influence

3079
02:20:50,304 --> 02:20:50,816
So much

3080
02:20:51,072 --> 02:20:51,584
Into the pit

3081
02:20:51,840 --> 02:20:54,656
The pr

3082
02:20:55,168 --> 02:20:55,680
And that means

3083
02:20:56,192 --> 02:20:56,704
He's not in the

3084
02:20:57,728 --> 02:21:01,568
She's a power player is very very clear

3085
02:21:02,080 --> 02:21:02,592
Like

3086
02:21:02,848 --> 02:21:06,176
Once you start stalking you know the game

3087
02:21:06,432 --> 02:21:07,456
Kristen like Beltway Paula

3088
02:21:07,968 --> 02:21:12,832
I'm trying to pee is a word talk

3089
02:21:14,880 --> 02:21:16,928
If you follow her she's got

3090
02:21:17,184 --> 02:21:18,976
Sponsored content that you don't know

3091
02:21:19,488 --> 02:21:24,096
Exactly

3092
02:21:25,120 --> 02:21:27,680
I think it's a different kind

3093
02:21:32,800 --> 02:21:34,080
Alright

3094
02:21:34,336 --> 02:21:37,152
We're still doing the show right now

3095
02:21:38,176 --> 02:21:40,480
One of the things that we always talk about is like trying

3096
02:21:41,504 --> 02:21:43,296
These worlds to each other which

3097
02:21:43,552 --> 02:21:44,064
Decent job

3098
02:21:44,320 --> 02:21:45,088
In this era stations

3099
02:21:45,344 --> 02:21:45,856
Who's gone off on

3100
02:21:46,368 --> 02:21:48,160
But I already say that

3101
02:21:48,416 --> 02:21:50,464
There's another one where Tom

3102
02:21:50,976 --> 02:21:52,000
Boy this sounds like

3103
02:21:52,512 --> 02:21:53,024
Something that could

3104
02:21:53,280 --> 02:21:54,304
Just be set on Alex's Joe

3105
02:21:55,840 --> 02:21:58,656
Any of them really

3106
02:21:58,912 --> 02:21:59,424
Become

3107
02:22:05,824 --> 02:22:09,408
I've leaving their fix to stay that's what Peter says if what Jude says

3108
02:22:22,464 --> 02:22:28,096
Somebody in the spirit of incarnation

3109
02:22:28,352 --> 02:22:28,864
Forgot

3110
02:22:30,656 --> 02:22:34,752
Speak into existence like

3111
02:22:35,008 --> 02:22:37,056
But they participated

3112
02:22:40,384 --> 02:22:44,224
Hazard scientist records

3113
02:22:45,760 --> 02:22:50,368
The genetics unique

3114
02:22:59,072 --> 02:23:00,864
It was something

3115
02:23:01,120 --> 02:23:03,168
I'd of the divine order

3116
02:23:03,424 --> 02:23:03,936
So

3117
02:23:04,192 --> 02:23:04,960
He said

3118
02:23:07,520 --> 02:23:08,800
My boy talking about chimeras

3119
02:23:09,312 --> 02:23:15,456
Is my boy talking about

3120
02:23:15,712 --> 02:23:18,016
Talking about genetic alterations

3121
02:23:18,272 --> 02:23:19,296
B Team

3122
02:23:19,552 --> 02:23:24,416
Chimera adjacent

3123
02:23:24,672 --> 02:23:25,184
However

3124
02:23:25,440 --> 02:23:27,488
They do know the basic amino acid structure

3125
02:23:27,744 --> 02:23:33,376
Capable of altering

3126
02:23:35,168 --> 02:23:36,192
Don't you dare

3127
02:23:40,800 --> 02:23:46,176
Like if God's Line in the Sand is like you can do the same thing as me but I can just go do it like

3128
02:23:47,968 --> 02:23:49,760
Not sure

3129
02:23:50,016 --> 02:23:52,576
Not sure this is a good vision

3130
02:23:52,832 --> 02:23:55,136
I think that's why were God I would say

3131
02:23:55,392 --> 02:23:58,720
Reserve that power for myself

3132
02:23:59,744 --> 02:24:01,792
Darken Watchers it sound workaround

3133
02:24:02,816 --> 02:24:03,328
I found

3134
02:24:03,584 --> 02:24:04,864
Waze

3135
02:24:05,120 --> 02:24:08,448
Anytime you get really into the weeds of theology

3136
02:24:08,704 --> 02:24:09,472
Sooner or later

3137
02:24:09,728 --> 02:24:10,496
They always point out

3138
02:24:10,752 --> 02:24:13,312
Loopholes in their own belief system

3139
02:24:13,568 --> 02:24:17,152
Lexus

3140
02:24:17,408 --> 02:24:19,200
Of course

3141
02:24:19,456 --> 02:24:25,600
Of course

3142
02:24:28,672 --> 02:24:30,208
It's always like they create this

3143
02:24:30,464 --> 02:24:31,232
Did they create the

3144
02:24:31,488 --> 02:24:32,256
Bulshit

3145
02:24:32,512 --> 02:24:33,024
God

3146
02:24:33,280 --> 02:24:34,560
Brennan is God is

3147
02:24:35,584 --> 02:24:38,400
To have been created bulshit

3148
02:24:38,656 --> 02:24:41,472
That allowed the dumb things at the dump

3149
02:24:41,984 --> 02:24:44,032
Stupid make

3150
02:24:44,288 --> 02:24:45,824
My minion

3151
02:24:46,848 --> 02:24:48,128
But I created them with

3152
02:24:48,384 --> 02:24:49,408
All of the abilities

3153
02:24:50,432 --> 02:24:53,248
Now their argument to that would be the goddess super into

3154
02:24:53,504 --> 02:24:55,808
Free will

3155
02:24:56,064 --> 02:24:58,624
Choose not to do that

3156
02:24:59,392 --> 02:25:02,464
I'm pretty sure that

3157
02:25:02,720 --> 02:25:03,232
What about

3158
02:25:05,280 --> 02:25:08,608
He's not real dad

3159
02:25:08,864 --> 02:25:10,656
What are you talkin about the lullaby

3160
02:25:12,192 --> 02:25:12,960
Abso

3161
02:25:13,984 --> 02:25:14,496
I was thinking

3162
02:25:14,752 --> 02:25:15,520
I guess I wasn't

3163
02:25:15,776 --> 02:25:16,288
Like I said

3164
02:25:16,800 --> 02:25:17,312
My boys

3165
02:25:20,896 --> 02:25:21,408
It's not a cow

3166
02:25:21,664 --> 02:25:22,944
Knockout

3167
02:25:24,480 --> 02:25:24,992
Since I first

3168
02:25:25,248 --> 02:25:28,576
Yeah and that means

3169
02:25:28,832 --> 02:25:31,648
Angel souls or whatever can get in there

3170
02:25:31,904 --> 02:25:33,184
That's why they were going to kill us

3171
02:25:33,440 --> 02:25:39,072
Could be a I don't know what you were talking about

3172
02:25:43,936 --> 02:25:44,448
Xerocon

3173
02:25:44,704 --> 02:25:45,472
Nope

3174
02:25:45,728 --> 02:25:51,872
You can just say one word was wrong and then not say what that word cuz he started jumping off into like everyone wants money

3175
02:25:52,128 --> 02:25:54,944
Vetline of

3176
02:25:58,016 --> 02:25:59,040
Really clear they're talking

3177
02:26:04,160 --> 02:26:08,768
Inference humanism in America

3178
02:26:09,024 --> 02:26:14,656
We are creating animals with human DNA inside is not from Missouri

3179
02:26:14,912 --> 02:26:18,240
It's his upper Missouri cuz if he was any voice you would have said Missouri

3180
02:26:18,752 --> 02:26:21,312
I know that much

3181
02:26:25,664 --> 02:26:26,688
That's my alma mater Aika

3182
02:26:26,944 --> 02:26:29,504
Tell you with almost categorical CertainTeed

3183
02:26:29,760 --> 02:26:33,600
Are not doing 100%

3184
02:26:35,392 --> 02:26:39,232
They don't have anywhere near the funding going to happen

3185
02:26:48,960 --> 02:26:54,336
154 the somebody emails mail so don't actually book

3186
02:26:54,592 --> 02:26:57,920
Novella

3187
02:26:59,712 --> 02:27:05,856
Assert that they are being created around the world

3188
02:27:06,112 --> 02:27:07,648
Reaching human

3189
02:27:17,120 --> 02:27:22,496
Exactly

3190
02:27:23,008 --> 02:27:28,640
Cuz he's friends with Steve Quayle the same thing all of this goes back to Syracuse

3191
02:27:29,152 --> 02:27:31,968
God dammit

3192
02:27:32,224 --> 02:27:38,368
Crossbreed

3193
02:27:41,184 --> 02:27:44,512
Open the show yesterday sing

3194
02:27:44,768 --> 02:27:48,096
Would know if I said what about CERN what do you know about CERN

3195
02:27:48,352 --> 02:27:48,864
Right

3196
02:27:49,120 --> 02:27:54,240
How many people know the stories around the world we are creating Human animals

3197
02:27:54,496 --> 02:27:57,056
They're supposed to be destroyed

3198
02:27:57,312 --> 02:27:59,360
Origami

3199
02:28:02,688 --> 02:28:03,456
Call Bing.

3200
02:28:03,712 --> 02:28:06,528
Destroyed

3201
02:28:06,784 --> 02:28:11,136
Would be like a new form of methylene

3202
02:28:16,512 --> 02:28:21,376
This is just a less charismatic version of galaxy

3203
02:28:21,632 --> 02:28:22,144
I hate to be Petty

3204
02:28:22,656 --> 02:28:23,680
But it would be the islands

3205
02:28:23,936 --> 02:28:25,472
Do doctors Marrero

3206
02:28:28,032 --> 02:28:32,384
Much much like it's Attorneys General

3207
02:28:36,224 --> 02:28:39,040
This is just another example of them warping

3208
02:28:39,296 --> 02:28:41,856
Things about science that are weird

3209
02:28:43,136 --> 02:28:43,904
These f****** people

3210
02:28:44,928 --> 02:28:46,976
Stevequayle.com

3211
02:28:47,488 --> 02:28:49,280
Unfortunately read a book

3212
02:28:53,120 --> 02:28:54,656
CERN

3213
02:28:54,912 --> 02:28:55,424
We do

3214
02:28:55,680 --> 02:28:56,192
And this is

3215
02:28:56,448 --> 02:28:56,960
This is pretty fun

3216
02:28:57,728 --> 02:29:00,544
When the angel comes down

3217
02:29:03,616 --> 02:29:07,456
Over them down there which is not worth

3218
02:29:07,712 --> 02:29:09,248
Apollyon

3219
02:29:09,760 --> 02:29:10,528
And of course.

3220
02:29:16,160 --> 02:29:19,232
Door into another universe

3221
02:29:25,632 --> 02:29:26,144
Wow

3222
02:29:28,960 --> 02:29:29,728
Correct

3223
02:29:29,984 --> 02:29:31,008
The other part of that is

3224
02:29:31,264 --> 02:29:33,056
That's f****** dumb what does churn mean

3225
02:29:34,592 --> 02:29:35,360
Translation

3226
02:29:35,616 --> 02:29:36,128
The name do you got

3227
02:29:36,896 --> 02:29:37,920
Cerm

3228
02:29:38,688 --> 02:29:40,992
I know it was originally

3229
02:29:41,760 --> 02:29:44,576
No I can get it

3230
02:29:45,088 --> 02:29:45,600
First of all

3231
02:29:45,856 --> 02:29:50,208
Dance the long pause and then I used to know I forget not great not great

3232
02:29:50,464 --> 02:29:52,256
Initial

3233
02:29:52,512 --> 02:29:53,792
That's right

3234
02:29:54,048 --> 02:29:55,840
It was a French acronym

3235
02:29:56,352 --> 02:29:59,424
What time is it

3236
02:29:59,680 --> 02:30:03,008
And like I said was a French acronym

3237
02:30:07,360 --> 02:30:09,152
What except the name

3238
02:30:09,408 --> 02:30:12,224
What my question is what does sir mean could have

3239
02:30:12,480 --> 02:30:14,784
I mean could it be connected to something else as well

3240
02:30:15,040 --> 02:30:19,648
What's interesting that in The Weeknd Faith there are two main

3241
02:30:19,904 --> 02:30:22,208
It's called the horned God herne the Hunter

3242
02:30:24,256 --> 02:30:27,072
If you look back to the conventional name given to it by the

3243
02:30:27,328 --> 02:30:29,632
The seltzer

3244
02:30:29,888 --> 02:30:31,424
The name given

3245
02:30:33,472 --> 02:30:34,752
Is

3246
02:30:35,008 --> 02:30:35,520
You're not

3247
02:30:35,776 --> 02:30:38,336
Actually the god of the underworld

3248
02:30:39,104 --> 02:30:41,408
So he is ready blog

3249
02:30:42,176 --> 02:30:43,456
The most Wild

3250
02:30:43,968 --> 02:30:48,576
Disconnected bulshit I think I've heard from somebody who is scrambling to remember

3251
02:30:49,088 --> 02:30:51,136
How to get rid of

3252
02:30:51,392 --> 02:30:51,904
Zach

3253
02:30:52,160 --> 02:30:56,256
How is it that you can say that it used to be a French acronym but then you

3254
02:30:56,512 --> 02:30:58,048
You cannot say what that acronym

3255
02:30:58,304 --> 02:30:58,816
Good for

3256
02:31:01,376 --> 02:31:04,448
You too and it takes its name from what the group was originally called the concert

3257
02:31:04,704 --> 02:31:06,752
Yale European poor little research

3258
02:31:07,264 --> 02:31:09,056
Nucleaire

3259
02:31:09,312 --> 02:31:11,616
Believed in that acronym was

3260
02:31:11,872 --> 02:31:16,480
Substantially better than what they would have ended up with when they change their name

3261
02:31:16,736 --> 02:31:20,320
Do the organization European nucleaire

3262
02:31:20,832 --> 02:31:26,976
Oprf is a perineum

3263
02:31:27,232 --> 02:31:29,280
Acronym when they change their name from

3264
02:31:29,536 --> 02:31:30,560
To organize seal

3265
02:31:30,816 --> 02:31:31,328
So like

3266
02:31:31,584 --> 02:31:35,424
Councils organization

3267
02:31:35,680 --> 02:31:39,264
Yeah you know what sucks

3268
02:31:39,520 --> 02:31:43,360
Because Council suggests that it's a small group of people making decisions

3269
02:31:43,616 --> 02:31:47,200
Fargo Boise

3270
02:31:47,712 --> 02:31:48,224
Yeah

3271
02:31:49,504 --> 02:31:53,344
It's been the organizer on European pull research nucleaire

3272
02:31:53,600 --> 02:31:55,392
Since 1954

3273
02:31:55,904 --> 02:31:58,976
They changed the name design but if kapiti the abbreviation

3274
02:31:59,232 --> 02:32:00,256
Concern

3275
02:32:00,512 --> 02:32:01,024
No because

3276
02:32:01,792 --> 02:32:02,304
Cuz the Celts

3277
02:32:02,560 --> 02:32:03,328
Forward sucks

3278
02:32:03,840 --> 02:32:06,400
So one of the reasons the idiot conspiracy theorist

3279
02:32:06,656 --> 02:32:08,960
America are probably more prone to targets

3280
02:32:09,216 --> 02:32:10,752
Is because we're not a member of the

3281
02:32:11,008 --> 02:32:13,056
Associate

3282
02:32:17,408 --> 02:32:18,944
We have Observer status

3283
02:32:19,456 --> 02:32:22,528
Which was held since 1997 but we're not an active

3284
02:32:22,784 --> 02:32:24,320
Participant

3285
02:32:25,600 --> 02:32:26,880
Rankled some feathers

3286
02:32:32,000 --> 02:32:34,048
Sure I put

3287
02:32:34,560 --> 02:32:37,632
That's what it is so there's some sort of anti-American

3288
02:32:38,144 --> 02:32:39,424
Projection

3289
02:32:39,680 --> 02:32:40,704
I think a lot of people like

3290
02:32:41,216 --> 02:32:44,288
These folks are feeling about this

3291
02:32:44,544 --> 02:32:47,104
And you can feel it in the same way there's like I think it's

3292
02:32:47,360 --> 02:32:48,384
The French acronym

3293
02:32:49,152 --> 02:32:50,432
It's a French acronym for

3294
02:32:50,688 --> 02:32:54,528
The Council of European Research into nuclear stuff

3295
02:32:55,040 --> 02:32:55,808
You're not like it's

3296
02:32:56,320 --> 02:32:56,832
Most

3297
02:32:57,600 --> 02:33:00,416
Simple acronym that you could know if you did

3298
02:33:00,672 --> 02:33:01,184
Annie

3299
02:33:01,440 --> 02:33:02,208
Any understanding

3300
02:33:02,720 --> 02:33:06,304
Siri search the French acronym

3301
02:33:06,560 --> 02:33:08,608
French acronym like

3302
02:33:09,376 --> 02:33:15,520
Look like in French means

3303
02:33:15,776 --> 02:33:16,288
Sprint then he

3304
02:33:17,312 --> 02:33:19,872
Like he's saying it's a French acronym as though

3305
02:33:20,128 --> 02:33:21,920
Who knows what those people think Akron

3306
02:33:22,944 --> 02:33:23,456
Weirdos

3307
02:33:24,480 --> 02:33:24,992
But it's that

3308
02:33:25,504 --> 02:33:26,528
Anti

3309
02:33:27,808 --> 02:33:28,832
Anti other

3310
02:33:29,344 --> 02:33:29,856
Mentality

3311
02:33:31,648 --> 02:33:32,416
It's it's

3312
02:33:32,672 --> 02:33:33,440
Crazy everywhere

3313
02:33:33,696 --> 02:33:35,488
It's crazy to me how we

3314
02:33:35,744 --> 02:33:36,256
Began this app

3315
02:33:36,512 --> 02:33:37,024
Episode

3316
02:33:37,280 --> 02:33:38,560
With Jim Bakker saying

3317
02:33:39,072 --> 02:33:40,608
There is only one God

3318
02:33:40,864 --> 02:33:41,632
Jehovah

3319
02:33:42,144 --> 02:33:44,704
And then at the end of this as well as we continued on through this

3320
02:33:45,472 --> 02:33:48,544
Jim Bakker believe now that every mythology is real

3321
02:33:48,800 --> 02:33:54,688
He must yeah or at least every every God from everywhere service

3322
02:33:54,944 --> 02:33:56,736
Celtic now why

3323
02:33:56,992 --> 02:33:57,504
What

3324
02:33:57,760 --> 02:33:58,784
Celtics

3325
02:33:59,040 --> 02:34:01,856
Actually

3326
02:34:02,112 --> 02:34:04,928
But let's username is

3327
02:34:05,184 --> 02:34:06,720
Some of that though

3328
02:34:06,976 --> 02:34:09,024
You were not unpacking correctly

3329
02:34:09,280 --> 02:34:10,304
I think I think there's a

3330
02:34:10,560 --> 02:34:11,584
Decent amount of that that is

3331
02:34:13,888 --> 02:34:17,216
Put up with that sort of thing

3332
02:34:17,472 --> 02:34:19,776
There's a little bit of

3333
02:34:22,080 --> 02:34:23,104
Ascribed

3334
02:34:23,360 --> 02:34:24,128
Subscribing to

3335
02:34:24,384 --> 02:34:25,664
Every

3336
02:34:26,176 --> 02:34:27,456
While he still brings

3337
02:34:27,712 --> 02:34:28,736
Fear of everything

3338
02:34:29,760 --> 02:34:31,552
I think there's some wiggle room it's not great

3339
02:34:31,808 --> 02:34:35,136
I'm going to you know what if it was like once

3340
02:34:35,392 --> 02:34:41,280
Add more lean towards you but it seems like they're bringing up all

3341
02:34:41,536 --> 02:34:44,608
Throwing everything like we got Shiva in there we got the

3342
02:34:44,864 --> 02:34:46,400
Son got in Arizona

3343
02:34:48,192 --> 02:34:54,336
We got Apollo is the one who's going to come up from the ground

3344
02:34:54,592 --> 02:34:56,128
God knows that Apollo is there like

3345
02:34:56,640 --> 02:34:57,664
Everything is real

3346
02:35:03,296 --> 02:35:04,064
Deep within the Earth

3347
02:35:06,624 --> 02:35:07,904
What happened on

3348
02:35:11,488 --> 02:35:12,000
Deity

3349
02:35:13,024 --> 02:35:13,536
I hate that

3350
02:35:15,584 --> 02:35:18,912
The celt I might even write a review

3351
02:35:19,168 --> 02:35:19,680
No one

3352
02:35:19,936 --> 02:35:22,752
No one

3353
02:35:23,008 --> 02:35:24,032
Is

3354
02:35:27,360 --> 02:35:28,128
There is

3355
02:35:28,384 --> 02:35:28,896
Cernunnos

3356
02:35:29,152 --> 02:35:30,688
And his other name is Larry Bird

3357
02:35:32,224 --> 02:35:32,736
Perry rapist

3358
02:35:34,272 --> 02:35:37,344
So the name cernunnos only exists in one place

3359
02:35:38,624 --> 02:35:40,160
It's on the pillar of the boat

3360
02:35:40,928 --> 02:35:43,488
Which is something that was from around 1st Century be

3361
02:35:44,000 --> 02:35:46,560
Ciara, naira

3362
02:35:47,072 --> 02:35:48,864
You said I'm going to make you boaters at met

3363
02:35:49,120 --> 02:35:51,168
Anime Kubo

3364
02:35:51,424 --> 02:35:52,704
Motorboat benintendi

3365
02:35:54,752 --> 02:35:57,312
I'm losing it towards the end of this

3366
02:35:58,592 --> 02:35:59,104
Certain

3367
02:35:59,616 --> 02:36:02,176
Exist only on this pillar

3368
02:36:02,432 --> 02:36:05,248
The name Cyrano says existed or nowhere else

3369
02:36:05,504 --> 02:36:09,856
Great antiquity

3370
02:36:10,368 --> 02:36:12,160
Deny that you've told me that that's going to hot

3371
02:36:12,672 --> 02:36:16,512
Probably put theirs

3372
02:36:16,768 --> 02:36:18,816
Is so fast

3373
02:36:19,328 --> 02:36:24,448
You just ruined my life I don't remember what the word for it is but there's a whole collection of like

3374
02:36:24,704 --> 02:36:26,240
Words that only exist in one place

3375
02:36:26,496 --> 02:36:30,080
Play sever

3376
02:36:30,336 --> 02:36:31,616
Yeah we have these like

3377
02:36:31,872 --> 02:36:35,456
All these texts from history

3378
02:36:35,712 --> 02:36:37,760
One time that was a one-time word

3379
02:36:38,016 --> 02:36:38,528
The one-off

3380
02:36:39,808 --> 02:36:42,112
This name exists on the pillar of the

3381
02:36:42,368 --> 02:36:43,904
Which was

3382
02:36:44,160 --> 02:36:44,672
The first century CE

3383
02:36:46,720 --> 02:36:48,256
Discovered

3384
02:36:48,512 --> 02:36:50,560
It doesn't really matter cuz their nose plays like

3385
02:36:50,816 --> 02:36:53,632
7th banana on that pillow to Jupiter

3386
02:36:54,144 --> 02:36:55,168
And a host of Romans

3387
02:36:55,424 --> 02:36:56,448
Garlic garlic

3388
02:36:56,960 --> 02:36:58,240
Yes

3389
02:36:58,496 --> 02:37:00,032
Conjecture that he was your friend

3390
02:37:03,616 --> 02:37:04,896
Historia

3391
02:37:05,152 --> 02:37:06,688
Conjecture that he was the Lord of

3392
02:37:06,944 --> 02:37:08,992
Animals or Wild Things based on

3393
02:37:09,248 --> 02:37:10,016
Scorned appearance

3394
02:37:10,272 --> 02:37:11,552
Chimera do you have horns

3395
02:37:12,576 --> 02:37:13,088
Sure

3396
02:37:13,600 --> 02:37:15,648
But there's a lot of there's a lot of DVDs overtime

3397
02:37:15,904 --> 02:37:16,672
There's a lot of chimeras

3398
02:37:16,928 --> 02:37:20,768
That's right like a bunch of other people have asserted that he's the god of

3399
02:37:21,024 --> 02:37:21,792
Fertility

3400
02:37:22,048 --> 02:37:23,584
And some subways

3401
02:37:23,840 --> 02:37:24,608
God of the underworld

3402
02:37:24,864 --> 02:37:25,888
Is also in there but it's

3403
02:37:26,912 --> 02:37:28,960
1 of 12

3404
02:37:33,056 --> 02:37:36,128
He's not one to one associated with the underworld like Zack

3405
02:37:36,384 --> 02:37:36,896
Who's dumb

3406
02:37:37,152 --> 02:37:37,664
Is thanks

3407
02:37:37,920 --> 02:37:38,432
So dumb

3408
02:37:38,688 --> 02:37:40,992
Now it's interesting because some forms of Wicca

3409
02:37:41,248 --> 02:37:42,784
Have taken on recognizing Serna

3410
02:37:43,296 --> 02:37:49,440
But only as much as they will take on about any God from

3411
02:37:51,744 --> 02:37:53,792
Nothing against the wiccans out there

3412
02:37:54,048 --> 02:37:56,864
But you love a hornet sound like

3413
02:37:57,120 --> 02:37:58,144
And so I thought I feel like

3414
02:37:58,400 --> 02:38:03,008
I don't know this Universal I don't know what you're going to say and I

3415
02:38:03,264 --> 02:38:04,800
Do what I think you're going to say it doesn't sound

3416
02:38:05,056 --> 02:38:06,592
From my experience with Wiccan

3417
02:38:06,848 --> 02:38:10,432
Go to high school

3418
02:38:10,944 --> 02:38:12,736
I feel like the horns are going to be important

3419
02:38:12,992 --> 02:38:14,528
No no

3420
02:38:14,784 --> 02:38:15,552
I have some

3421
02:38:16,064 --> 02:38:16,576
Anakin

3422
02:38:17,856 --> 02:38:18,368
It's not a blanket

3423
02:38:20,672 --> 02:38:21,696
It seems like

3424
02:38:21,952 --> 02:38:23,232
People who are

3425
02:38:23,744 --> 02:38:25,280
Drift drift that direction

3426
02:38:25,792 --> 02:38:27,584
Also where people who are kind of nerdy

3427
02:38:27,840 --> 02:38:29,120
And like obscure things

3428
02:38:30,144 --> 02:38:30,912
So I would

3429
02:38:31,168 --> 02:38:31,936
I would suggest

3430
02:38:32,448 --> 02:38:33,216
People who are attracted

3431
02:38:33,472 --> 02:38:35,776
Two wiccanism are also people who dude

3432
02:38:37,056 --> 02:38:38,336
Reading into

3433
02:38:38,592 --> 02:38:41,664
Various cultures around the world various deities

3434
02:38:41,920 --> 02:38:43,456
And probably someone was like

3435
02:38:43,712 --> 02:38:44,224
I found this

3436
02:38:44,480 --> 02:38:50,624
F****** obscure horned God

3437
02:38:50,880 --> 02:38:52,416
I meant certain toast came to be

3438
02:38:52,672 --> 02:38:56,000
I know Zach is making scary things

3439
02:38:56,512 --> 02:38:58,048
Because this one bowl image

3440
02:38:58,560 --> 02:38:59,328
Killer

3441
02:38:59,584 --> 02:39:00,864
It was stuck in fairy.

3442
02:39:01,120 --> 02:39:01,632
Underground

3443
02:39:03,936 --> 02:39:08,288
This was all a chicken laid out in the prophecy by Douglas Adams called The Long Dark teeth

3444
02:39:11,872 --> 02:39:13,664
Oh my God there's a Babel Fish

3445
02:39:13,920 --> 02:39:17,248
His books he's probably means he's Illuminati he stepped into the

3446
02:39:17,760 --> 02:39:18,528
God what

3447
02:39:19,040 --> 02:39:19,552
Jerk

3448
02:39:19,808 --> 02:39:21,088
Efeis

3449
02:39:21,344 --> 02:39:23,392
Yes

3450
02:39:23,904 --> 02:39:25,696
I wanted one more clip

3451
02:39:25,952 --> 02:39:29,536
But I didn't cut it cuz it was pointless

3452
02:39:29,792 --> 02:39:31,584
The apostles read the Septuagint

3453
02:39:34,144 --> 02:39:34,656
So

3454
02:39:35,168 --> 02:39:36,448
There's one thing I think

3455
02:39:37,984 --> 02:39:39,776
Lowest number

3456
02:39:40,288 --> 02:39:41,568
Between our worlds yes

3457
02:39:41,824 --> 02:39:42,848
Project Camelot

3458
02:39:43,360 --> 02:39:43,872
Alex Jones

3459
02:39:44,128 --> 02:39:44,640
And

3460
02:39:44,896 --> 02:39:50,272
The Jim Bakker almost had created a parallel universe where all of these were

3461
02:39:51,296 --> 02:39:52,576
On this exact

3462
02:39:53,088 --> 02:39:54,112
But I think there's one

3463
02:39:55,392 --> 02:39:55,904
On

3464
02:39:56,928 --> 02:39:57,952
A deeper level

3465
02:39:58,464 --> 02:39:58,976
Connect

3466
02:39:59,232 --> 02:40:00,000
Alex Jones

3467
02:40:01,280 --> 02:40:02,304
Scary Carrie cast

3468
02:40:03,328 --> 02:40:05,632
And Jim Baker's

3469
02:40:06,144 --> 02:40:06,912
It's not

3470
02:40:07,168 --> 02:40:08,192
It is this trend

3471
02:40:12,544 --> 02:40:13,056
Constrain

3472
02:40:13,312 --> 02:40:14,336
About his genetic

3473
02:40:18,688 --> 02:40:20,480
You mentioned a moment ago

3474
02:40:20,736 --> 02:40:21,248
Of the field

3475
02:40:21,760 --> 02:40:26,112
And you said when you were in prison

3476
02:40:27,904 --> 02:40:30,208
Spherion

3477
02:40:30,464 --> 02:40:30,976
Real quick

3478
02:40:31,232 --> 02:40:34,048
The part that Jim Bakker was talking about

3479
02:40:34,304 --> 02:40:40,448
Very clearly cutout it's episodes

3480
02:40:42,240 --> 02:40:44,544
That's not something it's reference back to

3481
02:40:45,056 --> 02:40:47,616
Also I don't know what Greek word he's talking about but let's

3482
02:40:47,872 --> 02:40:48,384
Butterfly

3483
02:40:49,408 --> 02:40:50,688
And the reason is simple

3484
02:40:50,944 --> 02:40:52,224
Translated these

3485
02:40:52,480 --> 02:40:54,016
It's because it essentially means

3486
02:40:55,552 --> 02:40:56,064
Like Mike

3487
02:40:56,320 --> 02:40:56,832
Stop it

3488
02:40:57,088 --> 02:41:01,696
5B

3489
02:41:01,952 --> 02:41:02,464
About

3490
02:41:07,328 --> 02:41:11,424
Maybe we'll come over friendly animals but

3491
02:41:11,680 --> 02:41:12,192
If Michael

3492
02:41:13,216 --> 02:41:13,728
Dangerous

3493
02:41:13,984 --> 02:41:15,008
Maybe that's

3494
02:41:15,264 --> 02:41:16,544
The 4th

3495
02:41:17,056 --> 02:41:20,128
Maybe it's something like that

3496
02:41:22,432 --> 02:41:28,576
Did you ever see the movie I Am Legend with Will Smith

3497
02:41:28,832 --> 02:41:32,672
What to use vegetable for people so real quick

3498
02:41:33,696 --> 02:41:38,560
Virus real

3499
02:41:42,400 --> 02:41:48,544
Nothing but the dreams of man dead

3500
02:41:48,800 --> 02:41:52,128
Elucidating

3501
02:41:52,384 --> 02:41:58,272
Trends that are part of the human condition

3502
02:41:58,528 --> 02:42:01,088
What is a metaphor allegory

3503
02:42:01,344 --> 02:42:02,112
Everything was just

3504
02:42:03,648 --> 02:42:04,160
Trippy weird

3505
02:42:04,416 --> 02:42:04,928
It would be

3506
02:42:06,208 --> 02:42:06,720
Walking fast

3507
02:42:08,256 --> 02:42:10,304
Very clearly misrepresented this

3508
02:42:11,840 --> 02:42:14,912
So now I'm at the one with Will Smith

3509
02:42:15,168 --> 02:42:15,680
That's right

3510
02:42:16,192 --> 02:42:16,704
Dude that's

3511
02:42:17,728 --> 02:42:19,008
F****** he's old enough

3512
02:42:19,264 --> 02:42:20,544
Vincent Price

3513
02:42:21,312 --> 02:42:21,824
Rush that

3514
02:42:22,080 --> 02:42:22,592
Vincent Price

3515
02:42:22,848 --> 02:42:24,640
2K for him to talk about

3516
02:42:26,688 --> 02:42:27,712
This

3517
02:42:27,968 --> 02:42:28,992
From all over the place

3518
02:42:30,528 --> 02:42:35,136
That was.

3519
02:42:37,952 --> 02:42:40,000
A butt

3520
02:42:42,304 --> 02:42:43,072
The Jesus of

3521
02:42:43,328 --> 02:42:44,352
I Am Legend

3522
02:42:44,864 --> 02:42:46,400
Is very worth okay

3523
02:42:46,656 --> 02:42:47,680
People understand

3524
02:42:55,104 --> 02:42:59,456
If naturally immune

3525
02:43:07,392 --> 02:43:08,416
Create

3526
02:43:10,720 --> 02:43:11,232
4

3527
02:43:11,488 --> 02:43:12,768
This

3528
02:43:19,936 --> 02:43:20,448
You take that back

3529
02:43:20,704 --> 02:43:24,032
The Antichrist know

3530
02:43:24,288 --> 02:43:26,336
Does the antithesis of Jesus right

3531
02:43:26,848 --> 02:43:32,992
Jesus was the Son of God the son of the devil

3532
02:43:37,344 --> 02:43:42,720
Somehow he is the amphitheater called his doctor

3533
02:43:42,976 --> 02:43:44,000
Well

3534
02:43:44,256 --> 02:43:45,536
Jesus also said

3535
02:43:47,584 --> 02:43:53,728
Communion the Antichrist

3536
02:43:54,496 --> 02:43:57,568
To create a situation where is sweeping the world

3537
02:43:57,824 --> 02:44:02,176
People are dying and there's only one

3538
02:44:03,200 --> 02:44:08,064
Is naturally immune to this disease and it turns out to be the Antichrist

3539
02:44:09,856 --> 02:44:16,000
From this disease in the form of

3540
02:44:17,024 --> 02:44:18,304
With the blood and flesh

3541
02:44:21,888 --> 02:44:26,496
I see one problem with this Beyond Myriad of problems

3542
02:44:26,752 --> 02:44:28,288
The Antichrist

3543
02:44:29,312 --> 02:44:30,592
My Flesh and my blood

3544
02:44:31,104 --> 02:44:35,456
Wouldn't it be just like

3545
02:44:36,736 --> 02:44:40,064
Drink your blood to survive

3546
02:44:42,624 --> 02:44:44,416
The way he's working in a metaphor is

3547
02:44:44,672 --> 02:44:46,976
Is troubling because there's one guy who's

3548
02:44:47,744 --> 02:44:48,512
Has Jesus

3549
02:44:49,280 --> 02:44:55,424
Nearest idea of that being your fee logical

3550
02:44:55,680 --> 02:44:56,704
Argument it wouldn't be

3551
02:44:56,960 --> 02:45:03,104
Just like we aren't surprised that one just like the Antichrist

3552
02:45:03,360 --> 02:45:05,152
Omani

3553
02:45:05,408 --> 02:45:05,920
F******

3554
02:45:06,176 --> 02:45:07,456
Sarah all the way

3555
02:45:07,712 --> 02:45:12,064
Do you like the Antichrist return

3556
02:45:12,320 --> 02:45:18,464
Fishes tequila multitude of Loaves and Fishes wifey Antichrist to raise Lazarus from

3557
02:45:19,488 --> 02:45:24,864
Exact same thing

3558
02:45:25,120 --> 02:45:28,192
How f****** stupid ass a fire long before

3559
02:45:28,448 --> 02:45:34,080
In the middle of it you're saying that God and Jesus is the one who say unless you take of My Blood

3560
02:45:34,336 --> 02:45:35,872
And my flesh you will die

3561
02:45:36,128 --> 02:45:36,896
I think you're like

3562
02:45:37,152 --> 02:45:42,528
The bad guys going to f****** do that and I'm basing this on a metaphor I'm making of misunderstanding

3563
02:45:42,784 --> 02:45:46,368
If you would actually

3564
02:45:46,624 --> 02:45:52,768
Read the f****** Omega Man you another the reason that he is Legend is because he's

3565
02:45:53,024 --> 02:45:55,584
A bad guy

3566
02:45:55,840 --> 02:46:01,984
That would make far more sense because if you wanted to

3567
02:46:02,240 --> 02:46:04,031
Work in the idea that these zombies

3568
02:46:04,287 --> 02:46:06,079
Really bloodthirst

3569
02:46:06,335 --> 02:46:08,127
The zombies

3570
02:46:08,383 --> 02:46:10,175
Dave community

3571
02:46:10,431 --> 02:46:11,455
Relationship

3572
02:46:12,479 --> 02:46:15,295
They are only monsters in the mind of the person

3573
02:46:16,831 --> 02:46:18,111
Abused them is Monster High

3574
02:46:18,623 --> 02:46:21,183
Then you might accept

3575
02:46:25,279 --> 02:46:28,351
Is a better metaphor from the I Am Legend Omega Man

3576
02:46:31,167 --> 02:46:33,727
Being the one who's trying to trick you into thinking

3577
02:46:33,983 --> 02:46:35,263
State you are cumin

3578
02:46:35,775 --> 02:46:36,543
Or whatever

3579
02:46:45,759 --> 02:46:46,527
I do love

3580
02:46:47,551 --> 02:46:48,063
So much

3581
02:46:48,575 --> 02:46:50,879
All of these people are just like

3582
02:46:51,647 --> 02:46:55,487
Have you ever seen The Matrix exact it's all that it's so much

3583
02:46:57,023 --> 02:46:57,535
Like

3584
02:46:57,791 --> 02:46:58,303
I get it

3585
02:46:59,327 --> 02:47:01,887
Movies of fun reading card

3586
02:47:02,655 --> 02:47:04,703
That I struggle with it

3587
02:47:07,263 --> 02:47:13,407
Like the other night that Carter page came out

3588
02:47:14,175 --> 02:47:15,711
Man this is a lie

3589
02:47:17,503 --> 02:47:18,015
Suck

3590
02:47:18,271 --> 02:47:23,903
Warrants are bored I wish there was a movie I can compare this

3591
02:47:24,159 --> 02:47:28,255
It's just like that I don't know.

3592
02:47:33,631 --> 02:47:34,399
Is lot of shortcuts

3593
02:47:34,655 --> 02:47:36,959
And propaganda

3594
02:47:37,215 --> 02:47:37,983
Oh my God

3595
02:47:38,495 --> 02:47:39,775
So I don't know we've learned

3596
02:47:44,895 --> 02:47:46,687
Thoroughly learned

3597
02:47:46,943 --> 02:47:47,455
That

3598
02:47:48,223 --> 02:47:49,759
Chimeras are real man

3599
02:47:50,783 --> 02:47:53,343
Chimeras are real if you know Steve

3600
02:47:53,599 --> 02:47:54,111
Also

3601
02:47:54,623 --> 02:47:55,647
All religions

3602
02:47:55,903 --> 02:47:56,415
Are real

3603
02:47:56,927 --> 02:48:02,559
There's only one God the all the religions are real but they're not God

3604
02:48:06,143 --> 02:48:06,911
The Earth

3605
02:48:07,167 --> 02:48:07,679
Absolutely

3606
02:48:11,519 --> 02:48:13,055
Bigsby amongst all these shows

3607
02:48:19,455 --> 02:48:21,759
Near that someone licks their lips run

3608
02:48:22,015 --> 02:48:22,527
Run

3609
02:48:22,783 --> 02:48:24,831
Close to

3610
02:48:25,087 --> 02:48:26,111
You f****** fail

3611
02:48:26,367 --> 02:48:27,903
Bale

3612
02:48:28,671 --> 02:48:29,439
What else

3613
02:48:29,695 --> 02:48:30,207
What else

3614
02:48:33,279 --> 02:48:38,143
Marketing campaigns are lure

3615
02:48:38,399 --> 02:48:44,031
Right not hard you don't look into the apostles couldn't

3616
02:48:44,543 --> 02:48:45,055
God

3617
02:48:45,311 --> 02:48:46,591
It seems like 200,000

3618
02:48:46,847 --> 02:48:47,359
Is too much rest

3619
02:48:48,127 --> 02:48:48,895
Big time

3620
02:48:49,151 --> 02:48:51,711
Yeah

3621
02:48:54,271 --> 02:48:58,879
Imagine imagine the amount

3622
02:48:59,135 --> 02:49:01,695
A wheelchair ramp

3623
02:49:01,951 --> 02:49:07,583
You have to have a Federal Regulation but the girl all the way around all the way up to

3624
02:49:07,839 --> 02:49:08,863
The doors and the windows.

3625
02:49:09,119 --> 02:49:10,399
Just how that fire marshal work

3626
02:49:12,959 --> 02:49:14,239

You did get that $200,000

3629
02:49:18,591 --> 02:49:19,103
What is shock

3630
02:49:19,359 --> 02:49:25,503
What a show car show

3631
02:49:25,759 --> 02:49:27,039
Fantastic

3632
02:49:27,295 --> 02:49:30,879
I don't know if we hit all the things you hope to recover but

3633
02:49:31,135 --> 02:49:34,719
Weird episode

3634

We're terrible at marketing

3639
02:49:55,199 --> 02:49:56,479
If you want people to like our show

02:49:56,735 --> 02:50:00,063
Tell them that we were actually named after

3641
02:50:01,087 --> 02:50:03,647
Flooded out
