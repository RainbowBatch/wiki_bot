1
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:20,736
Goddamn important

2
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:27,136
I have great respect but knowledge B I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys

3
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:56,320
Knowledge fight

4
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:59,136
Dot-com

5
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:05,536
Novelty Beverages and talk a little bit about Alex Jones

6
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:08,864
Jordan

7
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,144
Quick question for you sir

8
00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:17,312
My bright spot today is I'm talking into a new microphone

9
00:01:17,568 --> 00:01:22,176
Forgot I still have microphone

10
00:01:22,432 --> 00:01:23,712
But they're new

11
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:29,088
I noticed some popping popping and crackling and a couple of our recent episode

12
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,880
Together these new cords and

13
00:01:31,136 --> 00:01:31,648
Amanda's new

14
00:01:31,904 --> 00:01:33,184
This new windscreen feels good

15
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:35,744
On my face

16
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,584
It's much smoother it doesn't have years of

17
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,632
Other people's faces on it

18
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:42,656
Yeah

19
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:46,240
Recover covid-19

20
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:48,544
Four years were the only one who touched

21
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:51,360
Say yes it's nice though it's

22
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:53,408
I try bought a desk

23
00:01:53,664 --> 00:01:59,808
Mic stand as well but it does not attach to the

24
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:04,928
I still have some work to do on messing up my weekend warrior type

25
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:08,768
Yeah

26
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:09,792
For today I love it

27
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:11,840
How about you

28
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:17,216
Weekend warrior type project then I have

29
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:19,520
For probably like

30
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:21,056
13 years

31
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:22,592
Lived in

32
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,152
Apartment buildings with

33
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:28,736
People around me and so when I left

34
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:31,808
For apartment living I also left my drumset

35
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:39,232
I miss it you're you're at your guy looks throw some stick around you played drums for since I was like eight

36
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:44,352
Years old and then I had to stop at like 19 for the aforementioned reasons

37
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:45,376
And

38
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:47,424
It is been difficult and

39
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:52,288
Finally I realized that you can get an electric drum kit for like

40
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:53,056
300

41
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:55,872
So I got one wow

42
00:02:56,128 --> 00:02:58,432
Well how about that it's it's very cheap

43
00:02:58,688 --> 00:03:00,736
Garbage I'm going to break into

44
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:02,784
It's going to be like when I played rock band

45
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:06,368
Destroyed those hats

46
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:09,184
But it is so good to get back to jump

47
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:15,840
I don't know how it's still going to be too loud for your partner

48
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:19,936
The last time that I tried

49
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:22,496
Having a conversation while she was at work

50
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:27,616
Our rooms share a wall

51
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:31,200
With loud and I have a tendency to toss language about

52
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:37,600
Ingest not not fit for the classroom high school students

53
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:38,624
Heard me speak

54
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:40,928
So I bought some

55
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:44,512
Soundproofing shitzo my entire room is going to be turned into a

56
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:51,168
EStudio potentially good luck with that kind of tough unless you can get inside the walls I'm working on it

57
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:54,496
Well that's fine I hope you have Some Nights Fun. Dave Grohl ask

58
00:03:54,752 --> 00:04:00,128
Drummond adventures in Providence who hasn't played along to Queens of the Stone Age songs for the Dead

59
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:02,176
May I have on that rock band

60
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:07,552
But see what I'm saying you're a drummer and you played along with late Everlong on TalkBack

61
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:08,320
Fairly

62
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:09,600
Not on Expert

63
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:17,280
You don't know your 16th notes bro no I don't very fast

64
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:18,047
My foot

65
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:18,815
Get tired

66
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:21,631
90's rock bands

67
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:24,447
The sticks do the work that's what a lot of people don't know about drums

68
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:25,471
You think you got to hit up

69
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:26,495
With your arm

70
00:04:27,007 --> 00:04:33,151
You just move your wrist and say that it's like a cryptic mystery

71
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:34,943
I don't know

72
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:37,503
I loved rock band

73
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:38,271
And I spent

74
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:39,551
Hours

75
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:41,087
Hours

76
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:44,159
Trying to a one-hundred-percent Helter Skelter

77
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:46,463
An expert okay

78
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:47,743
I don't think I ever saw

79
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:50,047
Succeeded by tried it

80
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:51,839
Hundreds and hundreds of times

81
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:56,959
Because you getting the cheese method Beatles Rock Band if you want a hundred percent I don't expert

82
00:04:57,983 --> 00:04:58,495
Couldn't get it

83
00:04:58,751 --> 00:05:00,031
Couldn't get a couldn't do it huh

84
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:01,055
Ringo gacha

85
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:05,407
Classic drummer

86
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:07,455
Throws people

87
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:13,855
I'm sorry I was a lot of the other songs are pretty easy to put powder stelter is a little complex

88
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:15,391
Also not very good at rhythm-based

89
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:21,791
Stuff that's that's why I'm sorry if I

90
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:23,583
That's alright I'm sorry

91
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:28,447
Okay so Jordan today we got some interesting thing on our on our plate

92
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:31,519
It's in front of us and we don't really have an episode

93
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:34,079
That is futuristic

94
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:36,127
What happened

95
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:36,895
Was that

96
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:40,223
I did not want to do another episode for today about Alex

97
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:44,319
I wanted to push that to Wednesday because I needed personally break from

98
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:45,855
Yeah I was tired of this b*******

99
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:48,927
Last week was emotionally exhausted

100
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:49,951
On

101
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:52,767
The preparation for Friday's episode of the on the 8th

102
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:55,839
Yep straight through to present

103
00:05:56,095 --> 00:05:58,911
Non-stop lot it is been a lot of stuff that I

104
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:00,191
I grow weary

105
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:03,775
At the same time the payoff of the interview with Steve pieczenik

106
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:05,567
On the last episode was almost

107
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:08,383
Who was season-ending

108
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:12,479
F****** season finale we got

109
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:17,855
Cbpu given us the f****** cliffhanger

110
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:24,767
I decided to admit you as the

111
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:28,863
You go by which I would set up a military coup

112
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:35,263
Master

113
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:36,799
About that there was so satisfying

114
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:41,407
And narratively interesting to me that I found myself

115
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:43,967
Having a really tough time going back

116
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:44,991
Italics

117
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:48,063
I know it'll be temporary I'll be able to get back on the horse

118
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:52,671
I sat down to try and listen to other episode

119
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:53,695
I can't do this

120
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:54,975
Yeah

121
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:55,743
To do

122
00:06:56,255 --> 00:07:00,607
Naturally in times like this in the past but we've done is we've gone to various other

123
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:03,679
I online

124
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:10,079
We could I am so yeah I checked on Kerry Cassidy over a Project Camelot

125
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:16,735
The storming of the capital for 100 yeah 100% million percent

126
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:26,207
I got really bored listening to good aliens weren't him

127
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:27,487
Q and get back into

128
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:33,119
Space lady wasn't worth getting too deep into

129
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:35,679
There's apparently an archon alien

130
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:39,519
A singular one that runs the CIA

131
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:41,823
I did not know that

132
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:45,151
Okay that used to be this guy archon right but it's okay

133
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:46,943
Gary has some intelligence

134
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:48,223
He might have died

135
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:51,295
Gmail archive

136
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:52,063
Unclear

137
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:54,367
Proof that he's dead and not a shapeshifter

138
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:55,135
Can't do it

139
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:56,415
Ya can't do it

140
00:07:58,719 --> 00:07:59,743
Carrie bring it to me

141
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:02,559
Jim Baker's disappointed

142
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:04,351
And I still

143
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:09,215
Still don't like talking about Jim Bakker I don't know why I just don't

144
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:11,775
Still make me a little bit uncomfortable

145
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:15,615
I figured I'm not going to be able to go back to that well at 4

146
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:20,735
I just I don't want isn't going to say God does s*** talk about

147
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:26,879
Greatest big ass bucket oatmeal is you and I have both read the Bible and eating survival food we can just move on

148
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:28,671
Yeah so then of course

149
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:34,303
That was kind of like in a bind as I don't know what I'm going to do got to get something

150
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,071
Together

151
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:36,607
And then I remembered

152
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:40,703
So when I was looking at pictures of the capital on the sea

153
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:41,727
Yeah

154
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:45,055
I saw somebody wearing a pass the salt shirt

155
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:51,967
Which of course is the name of Dave daubenmire Coach Dave the name of his radio Ministry

156
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:54,271
Is that YouTube Broadcasting

157
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:57,599
I saw that I was like woah

158
00:08:58,367 --> 00:09:00,159
There's Dave daubenmire shirts

159
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:01,951
At the protest

160
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:04,255
The people storming there at the Capitol

161
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:05,791
What was he there

162
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:06,815
That would be

163
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:12,959
Who else is wearing a Dave David Mayer shirt

164
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:16,031
Dave had to have been there right

165
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:18,079
I am so I went and I check sure

166
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:20,383
Dave daubenmire was at the Capitol

167
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:23,199
Not possibly have been there really

168
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:29,855
James obermeyer decided to go storm the capitol

169
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:33,695
Football team manager

170
00:09:33,951 --> 00:09:34,463
Win

171
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:35,999
14

172
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:40,095
So today I wanted to take a little bit of a look

173
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:43,935
Get that but it's not really much of an episode I would learn a lot of time watching

174
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:44,959
These dreams

175
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:48,799
For what will ultimately be kind of

176
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:51,615
I don't know a little bit deflating

177
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:59,039
Look. If you would like our show tune back in on Wednesday we will have a full episode

178
00:09:59,295 --> 00:10:00,063
Expecting that

179
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:06,463
Battlestar Galactica

180
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:13,631
Busy bottle episode we couldn't afford to really do much here if you want to see some spaceship come back neck

181
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:18,239
So

182
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:20,543
What are things I have is really funny

183
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:21,311
Is

184
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:24,383
Dave is coach

185
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:25,407
Is a recording

186
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:30,527
And during the live stream from the Metro

187
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:32,319
So it's a little bit iffy

188
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:35,135
Does not great connection is

189
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:38,719
I don't happen what are the things that he does

190
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:43,583
Maybe unfortunate in hindsight is he literally doxs every single person

191
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:46,399
Who's all night train with him

192
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:49,215
But if any of them went in the capital

193
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:52,799
His broadcast could be identifying information

194
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:53,823
It will

195
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:54,591
8 look

196
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:55,871
It's obvious

197
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:57,663
This was always going to be the key

198
00:10:58,687 --> 00:10:59,199
That this would happen

199
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:04,575
But the fact that the people most afraid of Bill Gates tracking them all the time

200
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:06,623
Have ducts themselves Soca

201
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:07,391
Completely

202
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:08,671
It's just

203
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:14,815
It's never not going to be obvious going around like

204
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:15,583
Totally

205
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:17,375
To do this

206
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:19,423
Man I love it

207
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,983
Dave gets to

208
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:24,543
It's the talking about how many people they're going to be there

209
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:29,663
The only people who are uninterested in doxing each other are antifa

210
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:31,199
They're the only people who like

211
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:31,967
Hey

212
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:38,367
If you're going to video people don't put their face in it or say their real names everybody else is like

213
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:42,975
Here's my social security number

214
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:46,047
Are you from Nigeria

215
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:51,679
So you get to talkin about how there's got to be so many people there and this is

216
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:54,239
This is big this is not just a proton

217
00:11:57,567 --> 00:11:58,335
Formula

218
00:11:58,847 --> 00:11:59,871
Possibly

219
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:02,431
I'll be here downtown

220
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:05,759
Powerful message

221
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:11,647
No I don't think so coach

222
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:13,951
It's far beyond that

223
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:16,767
Once again Donald Trump is not going to call him

224
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:18,047
Called for this rally

225
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:19,327
He has a plan

226
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:21,887
9:00 this morning I believe he is going to

227
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:22,655
You talk

228
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:24,703
He's not it's not a pep rally

229
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:28,031
I do not believe this is game on member we talked about

230
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:32,127
You know we always have 11 men on offense an 11-minute Nissan Summit Reno

231
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:33,919
This is like this is like that

232
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:35,199
The coach turning to the

233
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:35,967
The stadium

234
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:36,991
And saying

235
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:38,271
Get on the field

236
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:39,807
Now's the Time

237
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:41,855
I think I might be feeling

238
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:43,391
Inspired to write a book

239
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:49,791
Xzibit I feel like there's a great book to be written about

240
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:52,095
Like all of the right-wing Media stuff

241
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:53,119
Prior to the

242
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:54,143
The capital storming

243
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:57,983
This looks bad in hindsight totally totally

244
00:12:58,495 --> 00:13:03,615
Ultimately the thing is really interesting about it is it's not really that different than the way they talk normally

245
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:08,223
Hubris enough detail

246
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:15,391
So there's a guy on the bus there and that Dave goes around he ejects in on

247
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:16,671
The temperature of the people in

248
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:20,767
In the crowd hey why you doing hey how you doing

249
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:21,791
It's now or never

250
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:27,935
Either now or never

251
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:30,239
Enjoy the

252
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:31,007
Blessings

253
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:32,799
America

254
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:33,567
74

255
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:36,383
And I I just don't want to see

256
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:38,175
Basically

257
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:38,943
The communist

258
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:41,503
That's what we're looking at

259
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:48,927
Yeah, he's becoming it's now or never got to stand up and fight these commies

260
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:53,791
Or else you're going to have a capitalist country to live in and have a great time with

261
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:54,559
I like

262
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:56,351
I like the reload

263
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:58,399
Of these guys

264
00:13:58,655 --> 00:14:00,447
Because I recognize how they

265
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:03,775
And that is exactly like comedy producers

266
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:06,335
Who have never put on a good show

267
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:08,383
I think we're going to have about four million people

268
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:13,503
That is very awesome

269
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:17,599
I'm telling you I've heard I got so many Facebook messages

270
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:19,391
Committed to showing up

271
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:26,047
You should have been here last week well actually it was going to be 4 million but it rained

272
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:29,887
No one could make it in

273
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:31,679
Oh no

274
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:35,007
It's Sunday there's always a good thing

275
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:37,567
You're so is weekly

276
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:41,663
Got to know there's football

277
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:42,431
Football bed

278
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:48,063
They are a little bit so there's a little bit of Pride or a little bit of expectation

279
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:53,951
And excitement it's definitely palpable until like they feel like they're getting ready to go

280
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:55,743
Do something more than

281
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:59,327
Enchantix or more here for sure

282
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:00,607
Yeah the electricity

283
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:02,143
Was clearly in the air

284
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:07,263
An interesting Lee I mean I think that

285
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:11,359
The people who are there have a lot more to say than just

286
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:12,383
Who stole the election

287
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:16,223
There's certainly some ideas that are big

288
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:18,015
Graphics on this bus

289
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:19,551
That are interesting

290
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:21,087
Trade-ideas great

291
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:22,623
Highfalutin ideas

292
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:30,815
Actually what you're doing is you're moving from

293
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:32,095
The admiralty

294
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:36,703
See

295
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:38,751
The land

296
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:39,519
Soil

297
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:42,079
It's very simple you just

298
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:43,615
Remove yourself

299
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:46,175
You go through the process

300
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:46,943
The paperwork

301
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:47,711
Remove your

302
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:49,247
Yourself as a US citizen

303
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:50,783
And become a citizen

304
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:52,063
The state you were born in

305
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:53,855
Sure enjoyed the Assembly of

306
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:55,135
State in your state

307
00:15:55,647 --> 00:15:56,415
That sounds great

308
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:57,183
State Nash

309
00:15:57,439 --> 00:15:57,951
National or state

310
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:59,231
Citizen of course

311
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:00,255
There is rumors

312
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:01,279
Trump is a

313
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:02,047
Estate Nashville

314
00:16:06,655 --> 00:16:07,167
And what

315
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:08,703
Have to do we talk about

316
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:09,983
Seceding

317
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:10,751
We don't need this

318
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:12,031
Sasidhar States

319
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:13,311
Feed ourselves

320
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:14,847
One at a time

321
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:16,639
And move over to the land Jersey

322
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:18,943
And what we're doing right now is

323
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:20,735
Text to Janna

324
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:21,759
Gun rights

325
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:23,807
She's done all the paperwork so that

326
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:25,087
Now right now or

327
00:16:25,343 --> 00:16:26,111
Repopulating

328
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:27,903
The original Constitution

329
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:29,183
1787

330
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:35,839
So I think Anna's on rights if I recall correctly somebody that I've heard Kerry Cassidy bring up quite a bit

331
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:47,615
And the screen in the room can't tell those are big old letters

332
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:51,199
Kick-off left when we got there just basically said

333
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:52,223
Alright

334
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:53,503
That

335
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:55,039
The president

336
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:58,111
They love most

337
00:16:58,367 --> 00:17:02,463
Is not an American citizen yeah that is a problem with his theory

338
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:03,999
Because Sovereign citizens are

339
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:10,399
Higher up on the ladder, at me with Obama wasn't born here and then you're going to tell me that you're

340
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:12,191
Your president isn't even American

341
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:15,775
SuperAmerica

342
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:19,103
Constitution of 1860

343
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:24,991
That's all just qanon Sovereign citizen

344
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:25,759
It's a bummer

345
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:28,575
It's a real bummer it's amazing to me

346
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:31,135
How important paperwork is

347
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:31,903
To these people

348
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:33,695
And how unimportant Rida

349
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:35,999
Yeah yeah it's

350
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:43,167
It's fun to because you know you got Dave here Coach Dave on the bus and he's having this guy explain how you become a

351
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:50,847
You got to take your way from the admiralty not like I don't know about that man

352
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:54,687
I can't wait to have you on the show again

353
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:59,295
So it's okay but look this guy knows what he's talking about

354
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:00,063
I think it was a loss

355
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:02,623
Do our whole movement is I believe

356
00:18:03,135 --> 00:18:03,903
Who's going to be about

357
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:05,695
Teaching people how to get out of the

358
00:18:06,463 --> 00:18:06,975
The admiralty

359
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:09,535
In the Vatican

360
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:10,559
Xavier

361
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:13,375
La comes from LA

362
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:16,447
Land Air Water that's where the word Wok

363
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:17,215
I'm sprung

364
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:18,751
The three jurisdiction

365
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:20,031
The pop figures

366
00:18:20,287 --> 00:18:20,799
The South 13th

367
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:26,431
Thunder that the only way

368
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:27,967
The only way to get out of

369
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:29,247
You going land

370
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:30,271
Soil and get back

371
00:18:32,575 --> 00:18:33,087
1780 South

372
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:33,855
Sure

373
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:39,487
Land Air Water that's what lawmakers are we doing this are we doing this dance

374
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:40,255
We're not

375
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:41,279
The pat.

376
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:42,303
The Vatican

377
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:43,839
It's the law of the air

378
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:44,863
Right

379
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:46,399
And then I think

380
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:52,799
The British Empire is the land of the law of the sea

381
00:18:53,055 --> 00:18:56,895
Admiralty law

382
00:18:57,151 --> 00:18:57,663
Just everybody

383
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:01,759
The land the land is related is just the constitution of India

384
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:03,807
Yeah but not the United States

385
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:05,343
Individual states

386
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:07,903
Because we're also

387
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:11,743
The articles is this apply to people in other countries

388
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:16,863
There are so they don't have any choice

389
00:19:19,423 --> 00:19:20,959
Figure this out and 1300

390
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:24,287
Figured what out that law means land air and water

391
00:19:24,543 --> 00:19:26,591
In what language

392
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:31,967
It looks like an Enderman

393
00:19:32,223 --> 00:19:32,991
Alright

394
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:35,039
Fire water

395
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:37,343
Long ago

396
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:38,623
My father

397
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:43,487
J.k. Simmons

398
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:45,279
Element

399
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:46,559
Equal jurisdiction

400
00:19:46,815 --> 00:19:52,447
Savitar not the not the Cameron bulshit I'm talking I love

401
00:19:52,703 --> 00:19:53,727
Decameron watch

402
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:55,519
Air powers

403
00:19:56,287 --> 00:19:58,079
I watch the James Cameron movie

404
00:19:58,335 --> 00:19:58,847
Cuz I was

405
00:19:59,103 --> 00:20:00,639

00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:03,455
But I go see it cuz I like fire

407
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:08,063
I also saw Avatar cuz it was too big to not see

408
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:14,463
You're not one of those things that I get you got it

409
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:20,863
Adult there was there was a time when that came out I was OVA

410
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:22,399
Haters I guess you gotta see this

411
00:20:22,911 --> 00:20:24,191
People are going to be talking about it

412
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:25,983
And I don't care about that now

413
00:20:27,263 --> 00:20:29,055
I think I did see the last Skywalker

414
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:29,823
You did

415
00:20:30,335 --> 00:20:31,615
I think I did

416
00:20:33,151 --> 00:20:33,919
Tell me when

417
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:37,247
What did you get it on DVD Dan

418
00:20:39,295 --> 00:20:40,575
No I think I did see it though

419
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:43,903
We'll deal with his later

420
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:46,975
Anyway there's three jurisdiction

421
00:20:47,231 --> 00:20:53,375
We're all under a log

422
00:20:53,631 --> 00:20:56,191
I would like he was Adrian law

423
00:20:56,447 --> 00:20:58,239
Before we go any further

424
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:00,799
In any conversation with this guy

425
00:21:01,055 --> 00:21:01,823
I want to know a

426
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:03,103
Exactly the laws of a

427
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:06,687
I need to know what airline is that the pope has

428
00:21:06,943 --> 00:21:07,455
Control

429
00:21:08,223 --> 00:21:12,319
Yeah if I were to go any further in this conversation with this guy which I wouldn't

430
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:14,111
Here's here's how it go

431
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:16,928
What's over there

432
00:21:17,184 --> 00:21:23,328
That move like pretending that he saw something somewhere else and just would walk off

433
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:30,240
I really admire the hell out of his ability to get away from to

434
00:21:30,496 --> 00:21:31,776
Like party conversations

435
00:21:32,032 --> 00:21:35,616
Four people and the three of them start having a conversation and you're like

436
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:38,688
I want to jump in but it's just not going to happen

437
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:43,808
You look over you like all my God and then you just walk away you saw a friend

438
00:21:44,832 --> 00:21:45,600
Keep pulling that off

439
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:48,928
Like perfectly is that you have to end up somewhere that

440
00:21:49,184 --> 00:21:55,072
It's not indirect I shot of the people you just like around over there

441
00:21:56,096 --> 00:21:56,608
Anyway

442
00:21:56,864 --> 00:21:59,168
Call Davis heard there's a lot to be worried about

443
00:21:59,424 --> 00:21:59,936
There's a lot of

444
00:22:00,192 --> 00:22:00,704
Breck's

445
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:01,984
Short on the ground there's like a

446
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,520
Antifa

447
00:22:03,776 --> 00:22:05,824
He's not worried about any that s***

448
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:06,592
I'm not worried

449
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:11,968
Pepper spray

450
00:22:12,224 --> 00:22:12,736
I'm not worried

451
00:22:17,088 --> 00:22:18,880
World War going to war

452
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:21,184
Spiritual war

453
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,464
What is the physical War

454
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,232
Brake shops

455
00:22:27,072 --> 00:22:27,584
Causa

456
00:22:29,888 --> 00:22:30,400
Boiling

457
00:22:32,448 --> 00:22:33,216
Here

458
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:36,032
Here's a true work of authority

459
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:41,408
The mayor of DC has no military Authority not over the National Guard or anything all she has

460
00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:42,944
Is DC police

461
00:22:44,736 --> 00:22:45,504
Grosse Tete

462
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:46,272
They will step

463
00:22:47,296 --> 00:22:48,320
There's too many of them

464
00:22:48,832 --> 00:22:54,976
So it doesn't look good in hindsight

465
00:22:55,488 --> 00:22:59,072
The conversation certainly seemed to be

466
00:23:01,376 --> 00:23:05,472
What would you call that what's the what's the right word I'm looking for

467
00:23:05,728 --> 00:23:09,824
Is that a way to go it's it's very much like you know like

468
00:23:10,336 --> 00:23:11,872
If you accept the encrypted

469
00:23:12,128 --> 00:23:13,664
If you accept the idea that like

470
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:20,064
Do they kind of planning on so I can store a little nap at all

471
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,624
Text here before that

472
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:23,904
They look

473
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:29,024
We don't want any trouble but if there's trouble there's four million of us cops are on our side

474
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:29,792
If it's

475
00:23:30,048 --> 00:23:30,816
The capital was the con

476
00:23:31,072 --> 00:23:33,120
Constitution leaves assholes are the preamble

477
00:23:33,888 --> 00:23:35,424
The Preamble was probably

478
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,472
One of the words I was trying to look for and ice

479
00:23:37,728 --> 00:23:38,752
Couldn't figure out a way to make it work

480
00:23:39,008 --> 00:23:40,288
Grammatically

481
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:43,360
Capitol Police

482
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:44,896
Troy

483
00:23:45,152 --> 00:23:46,944
And there's not enough of a man

484
00:23:47,456 --> 00:23:48,480
There's just not enough

485
00:23:48,736 --> 00:23:50,016
There's not enough.

486
00:23:51,808 --> 00:23:52,320
Haydel how many

487
00:23:52,576 --> 00:23:53,600
Policeman would you say there are

488
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:55,648
In

489
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:56,928
I'm just

490
00:23:57,184 --> 00:23:57,696
Thousand

491
00:24:00,256 --> 00:24:03,072
Jefferson Parish Jefferson Parish we have

492
00:24:03,584 --> 00:24:04,096
We have 50

493
00:24:04,352 --> 00:24:04,864
1800

494
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:05,888
Officers

495
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:06,912
That not just officer

496
00:24:07,168 --> 00:24:08,448
Does people who work in the dab

497
00:24:08,704 --> 00:24:13,056
Detectives and everything and that's for a population of a half a million people

498
00:24:18,944 --> 00:24:19,456
Do they have enough

499
00:24:19,968 --> 00:24:20,992
What if

500
00:24:21,248 --> 00:24:22,016
500000

501
00:24:27,136 --> 00:24:27,648
Enough

502
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:28,672
Decided they're going

503
00:24:31,488 --> 00:24:32,000
I don't know

504
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:33,536
What was that

505
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:36,352
What my break

506
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,704
Advocate

507
00:24:41,984 --> 00:24:43,008
Truth of the matter is

508
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,544
Violence all around us

509
00:24:47,616 --> 00:24:48,384
The days of John the Baptist

510
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:49,152
Don't know

511
00:24:49,408 --> 00:24:49,920
Keno.

512
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:51,712
Mile-a-minute

513
00:24:51,968 --> 00:24:52,480
Taking a bus for

514
00:24:55,296 --> 00:24:56,576
They're forcing us

515
00:24:56,832 --> 00:24:58,112
Six Flags

516
00:24:58,624 --> 00:24:59,136
Therefore

517
00:25:00,928 --> 00:25:01,440
Therefore

518
00:25:02,464 --> 00:25:03,232
Travel

519
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:05,792
The nursing

520
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:08,096
Masterforce your nephew understand this

521
00:25:08,608 --> 00:25:09,120
Good beats

522
00:25:09,376 --> 00:25:11,936
Same argumentation styles

523
00:25:12,192 --> 00:25:14,752
But we don't want trouble

524
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:16,288
All violence

525
00:25:16,544 --> 00:25:18,848
Could be seen as offensive as secretly defense

526
00:25:19,104 --> 00:25:20,896
They want to give me a vaccine

527
00:25:21,664 --> 00:25:24,224
It's not great to hear this from someone who's

528
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:27,552
That presumably a religious leader

529
00:25:28,064 --> 00:25:29,600
I would argue that

530
00:25:29,856 --> 00:25:31,648
Spreading a disease is violence

531
00:25:31,904 --> 00:25:32,416
Stand

532
00:25:32,672 --> 00:25:33,696
Offensive violin

533
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:37,024
That's an interesting argument that you can make with that

534
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,304
B

535
00:25:38,816 --> 00:25:42,144
And it seems like they are doing Maybe

536
00:25:43,424 --> 00:25:44,704
Yeah you'd want to probably have some

537
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,496
Qualification for like negligence

538
00:25:46,752 --> 00:25:47,264
Sure

539
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,056
Something

540
00:25:49,312 --> 00:25:50,848
Unless you're spitting on people

541
00:25:51,104 --> 00:25:52,640
And then there's that

542
00:25:52,896 --> 00:25:56,224
You're out of line I don't know if you're aware that wearing a mask

543
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,528
Can save somebody else's life

544
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,832
And you're like

545
00:26:01,344 --> 00:26:07,488
You have now committed violent yes but how do you prove the person actually believe libertarian nonsense

546
00:26:07,744 --> 00:26:09,024
Since November

547
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:11,584
But you would have to prove that the person

548
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:12,608
Either wear

549
00:26:12,864 --> 00:26:13,888
That

550
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:14,912
Do masks help

551
00:26:15,168 --> 00:26:15,936
They believe that

552
00:26:16,192 --> 00:26:17,472
And are choosing to not do it

553
00:26:18,752 --> 00:26:19,264
Cuz

554
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,544
The denial could be

555
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,080
Strong and sure

556
00:26:22,336 --> 00:26:22,848
Sure

557
00:26:23,104 --> 00:26:24,640
I don't know if I

558
00:26:24,896 --> 00:26:26,688
Care about denial Minot

559
00:26:26,944 --> 00:26:27,712
Court might though

560
00:26:27,968 --> 00:26:29,248
My but it's

561
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:31,040
Kind of like a math problem

562
00:26:31,296 --> 00:26:31,808
Like I don't

563
00:26:32,064 --> 00:26:33,088
Care if you think

564
00:26:33,856 --> 00:26:35,904
That math doesn't work

565
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:36,928
It still does

566
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,720
So you have to

567
00:26:38,976 --> 00:26:39,744
Live by Matt

568
00:26:43,072 --> 00:26:45,376
Steve spends more time on this bus there was a

569
00:26:45,632 --> 00:26:46,144
I think it's bad

570
00:26:46,912 --> 00:26:49,472
And then it goes to the guy in the studio

571
00:26:49,984 --> 00:26:51,520
Studio Amy MS Office

572
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:56,640
Sure and he's another preacher and he just has some people pray

573
00:26:57,152 --> 00:26:58,432
And stuff and I don't care

574
00:27:00,224 --> 00:27:01,248
Later they arrived

575
00:27:01,504 --> 00:27:02,016
The capital

576
00:27:02,528 --> 00:27:03,296
There's at least

577
00:27:03,552 --> 00:27:05,344
One picture I saw that was of

578
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,392
Pass the salt cellar

579
00:27:07,648 --> 00:27:09,440
They were they were around all right

580
00:27:09,952 --> 00:27:13,280
Angela heads

581
00:27:13,536 --> 00:27:15,584
I'm calling somebody or is it past the salt

582
00:27:20,448 --> 00:27:24,032
Yeah and Dave comes on his show and there's a little bit of reflection

583
00:27:24,288 --> 00:27:24,800
Can going on

584
00:27:25,568 --> 00:27:26,592
We are over the target

585
00:27:26,848 --> 00:27:29,152
Alex Jones said about 25 years ago

586
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:30,944
Is a nympho War

587
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,248
It's an information War

588
00:27:33,504 --> 00:27:34,528
Boys and girls we are

589
00:27:34,784 --> 00:27:35,552
Dead center

590
00:27:36,064 --> 00:27:36,576
Target

591
00:27:36,832 --> 00:27:38,624
Information

592
00:27:39,392 --> 00:27:40,672
You know I'm just a fly

593
00:27:40,928 --> 00:27:41,696
On the butt of us

594
00:27:42,976 --> 00:27:43,488
I understand that

595
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:44,768
I'm going to tell you something

596
00:27:45,792 --> 00:27:47,072
We are over

597
00:27:47,328 --> 00:27:47,840
The target

598
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,144
Like we never we never been

599
00:27:50,656 --> 00:27:52,704
So he's just using Alex language

600
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:56,544
Directly referencing a f****** info Warrior

601
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:59,872
Man I don't want to be killed by a bunch of cowards like this

602
00:28:00,384 --> 00:28:02,432
I don't lie don't like the idea that this

603
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,224
Extremist

604
00:28:04,736 --> 00:28:08,064
Political communist

605
00:28:08,576 --> 00:28:11,648
Ideology is being so successfully marketed

606
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:13,184
Under the veil of

607
00:28:14,464 --> 00:28:16,000
Yeah like I really really think

608
00:28:16,256 --> 00:28:19,584
Think that's terrifying I would I I would rather

609
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,632
Be killed in a fight with ISIS

610
00:28:22,144 --> 00:28:24,704
Cuz Isis is at least like I want to kill you

611
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:25,472
You know

612
00:28:25,728 --> 00:28:26,240
None of this

613
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:29,824
Wishy washy cowardice from the conservatives just like

614
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:34,432
I don't want any violence but I'm going to have to kill you guys

615
00:28:34,688 --> 00:28:35,968
And then violent says happen

616
00:28:36,224 --> 00:28:38,272
Wowowo guys we didn't ever want

617
00:28:38,528 --> 00:28:40,320
At least Isis is like I'm going to kill you

618
00:28:40,576 --> 00:28:42,624
Is there is there is a

619
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:43,648
Terrorist group

620
00:28:43,904 --> 00:28:50,048
Generally do take responsibility for their actions

621
00:28:50,304 --> 00:28:50,816
Stingley

622
00:28:51,584 --> 00:28:56,448
Dave has a very similar take on things after the fact that his hero Alex Jones

623
00:28:56,704 --> 00:29:01,824
Strange part of the information where that's going on and here's your going to be your greatest battle and my greatest battle

624
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:02,848
Is you're going to have to

625
00:29:03,104 --> 00:29:03,616
Convince

626
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:05,920
The people that you come in contact

627
00:29:06,944 --> 00:29:07,712
That what happened

628
00:29:08,736 --> 00:29:09,504
Yesterday

629
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,296
In Washington d.c. wasn't this

630
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:13,088
This was what happened

631
00:29:14,112 --> 00:29:15,904
Storming at storming of the

632
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:17,440
The Capitol building

633
00:29:18,208 --> 00:29:20,512
The infiltration of antifa BLM

634
00:29:21,024 --> 00:29:22,304
As part of that infiltration

635
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:23,328
Yes Peyton

636
00:29:23,584 --> 00:29:25,888
Did breakthrough they did break through

637
00:29:26,144 --> 00:29:26,912
And get into the cap

638
00:29:27,936 --> 00:29:28,448
Got a something

639
00:29:28,704 --> 00:29:29,728
Are you listening to me

640
00:29:30,752 --> 00:29:31,264
They lettuce

641
00:29:32,288 --> 00:29:33,056
Listen to me

642
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:35,104
They let us break

643
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:35,872
True

644
00:29:36,896 --> 00:29:37,408
They left

645
00:29:37,664 --> 00:29:38,176
But they left

646
00:29:38,432 --> 00:29:39,968
The Patriots blind breakthrough

647
00:29:40,224 --> 00:29:41,760
And then embedded

648
00:29:42,016 --> 00:29:43,040
BLM

649
00:29:43,296 --> 00:29:43,808
In

650
00:29:44,064 --> 00:29:44,576
The group

651
00:29:45,856 --> 00:29:46,624
And all the wicked

652
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:49,440
Crazy stuff that happened inside that Capitol building

653
00:29:49,952 --> 00:29:51,232
That was not done by Page

654
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,024
That was not.

655
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:55,328
I love the idea that he's saying

656
00:29:55,584 --> 00:29:56,864
On the 7th

657
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:57,888
Hey

658
00:29:58,144 --> 00:30:01,728
It's suspicious that the cops let them through when the boarding up

659
00:30:02,752 --> 00:30:04,288
The cops are going to let us through

660
00:30:05,056 --> 00:30:06,592
It's it's it's very strange

661
00:30:06,848 --> 00:30:09,152
It implies like a real change of like

662
00:30:09,408 --> 00:30:11,968
Perspective Alec Aldis actually happen dogshit

663
00:30:12,224 --> 00:30:12,736
Yeah

664
00:30:12,992 --> 00:30:16,576
I just see that so universally would ask these folks that you look at online

665
00:30:17,088 --> 00:30:18,880
I did not expire

666
00:30:19,136 --> 00:30:23,488
We got to find a way to not take responsibility for whoever s*** on that desk

667
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:24,768
If anybody

668
00:30:25,024 --> 00:30:25,792
Comes at me

669
00:30:26,048 --> 00:30:26,560
With

670
00:30:27,328 --> 00:30:27,840
Listen

671
00:30:28,096 --> 00:30:29,120
To any conservative

672
00:30:29,376 --> 00:30:30,656
I in the media now

673
00:30:31,168 --> 00:30:31,680
No

674
00:30:31,936 --> 00:30:32,448
What do you mean

675
00:30:33,472 --> 00:30:34,496
Protect

676
00:30:34,752 --> 00:30:35,264
Don't even

677
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,800
Like I've can't engaged

678
00:30:37,568 --> 00:30:39,616
This was the moment where it's like

679
00:30:40,128 --> 00:30:41,408
No matter what you do

680
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:45,248
You caused this and then you disappear out it so go f*** yourself

681
00:30:45,504 --> 00:30:48,576
Alfira coward complete coward

682
00:30:49,088 --> 00:30:50,880
It's you're worse than Isis

683
00:30:51,392 --> 00:30:57,536
A ride for you and comparing things Isis

684
00:30:57,792 --> 00:31:01,632
People is Isis wow

685
00:31:02,144 --> 00:31:05,984
I think that what are things that I found what I was looking at this was

686
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:09,568
First of all I feel like Dave daubenmire incredibly boring

687
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:17,504
I don't know maybe it's been a long time since I've looked at any of his actual shows or anyting it just struck me as like you

688
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,808
We're just taking notes from Infowars shows

689
00:31:20,064 --> 00:31:20,832
And preaching

690
00:31:21,088 --> 00:31:21,600
With it

691
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:24,416
It's a stupid

692
00:31:25,696 --> 00:31:26,720
It's almost like

693
00:31:27,744 --> 00:31:31,584
The idea of covering his show actually feels kind of like drink

694
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:32,352
Backwash

695
00:31:32,608 --> 00:31:34,144
Yeah you know like

696
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,168
I'm not interested

697
00:31:35,424 --> 00:31:36,448
Yeah but

698
00:31:37,216 --> 00:31:37,984
He was there

699
00:31:40,032 --> 00:31:40,544
This is

700
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,080
An interesting set of

701
00:31:42,336 --> 00:31:44,640
Circumstances an interesting set of behaviors

702
00:31:44,896 --> 00:31:45,408
Be like

703
00:31:45,664 --> 00:31:47,712
Hey Trump is telling us all

704
00:31:47,968 --> 00:31:48,992
To get on the field

705
00:31:49,248 --> 00:31:50,784
You know like

706
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:51,552
The 12th

707
00:31:51,808 --> 00:31:52,320
I mean 23 Jersey

708
00:31:52,832 --> 00:31:53,344
Something that's just

709
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:54,112
Good clean fun

710
00:31:54,624 --> 00:32:00,000
That's fantastic that's fantastic literally talking about the possibility of Stormy the capital and have the police will

711
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:03,584
And then the next day there's a

712
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:07,424
Conspiracy afoot trying to set us up

713
00:32:07,936 --> 00:32:14,080
Police let us know when they let us in the embedded and matter in there

714
00:32:14,336 --> 00:32:17,152
Doing this

715
00:32:18,432 --> 00:32:19,712
It's really dumb

716
00:32:19,968 --> 00:32:20,736
Bunch of f******

717
00:32:20,992 --> 00:32:22,016
Cowards it's very dumb

718
00:32:22,528 --> 00:32:23,296
And

719
00:32:24,576 --> 00:32:27,648
So was this quality of

720
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,952
I think I said that before

721
00:32:30,208 --> 00:32:34,304
It's just that whole thing of just like really this is who we're up against

722
00:32:35,072 --> 00:32:36,352
Come on man

723
00:32:37,376 --> 00:32:40,704
It is shittiest fascism I've ever see

724
00:32:41,472 --> 00:32:44,032
Yeah I bet all of them have been disappointing

725
00:32:44,288 --> 00:32:45,312
In the in the moment

726
00:32:45,568 --> 00:32:46,848
Yeah

727
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,896
I bet overtime
