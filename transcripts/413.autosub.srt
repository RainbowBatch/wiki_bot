1
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:20,992
Damn important

2
00:00:21,248 --> 00:00:27,392
I have great respect for Tenaya Lodge B

3
00:00:56,064 --> 00:00:56,832
What's fight.com

4
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:05,536
Everybody was acknowledged

5
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:10,144
Alex Jones Jordan Jordan

6
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:10,912
Do you have a break

7
00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:11,680
Spot Forest

8
00:01:11,936 --> 00:01:13,984
Sure

9
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,264
That's a lot of fun

10
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:17,312
Actuate

11
00:01:17,568 --> 00:01:18,848
This time that we are in

12
00:01:19,104 --> 00:01:25,248
I've found that I feel like I will need to treat ourselves a little bit

13
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:27,296
You know isolating and

14
00:01:27,552 --> 00:01:28,832
Self quarantining to Anna

15
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:34,464
Self quarantining might be like a really extreme

16
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,768
Sing a little bit trying to stay inside our houses more

17
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:38,560
We need to do little things

18
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:42,144
You got to stay sane yourself with little things

19
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,704
Maybe that you wouldn't normally give yourself

20
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,240
So I've you know

21
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:47,008
PopCorners

22
00:01:47,264 --> 00:01:50,080
No I do have plenty still though I have a lot

23
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:55,712
Goodbye like a little mini freeze-dried marshmallows

24
00:01:55,968 --> 00:01:57,248
Just to Put-in-Bay

25
00:01:57,504 --> 00:02:03,648
You know like that you wouldn't have Lucky Charms

26
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:07,232
I haven't actually corrected that yet so not sure if that's a great tree

27
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:11,840
Things I did was I realized that I used to have or not used to it

28
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:15,168
A while back I had a big Klondike face

29
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,448
Mcbarge

30
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:18,752
And I like the variety of them

31
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:19,776
At the pet about

32
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:20,800
50 Cent

33
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:27,456
They have these great flavors you know like there was a mint chip

34
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:33,856
On the Reese's cup one is at the store and I noticed that

35
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:37,952
They had a new one that I've never seen before and it was called Klondike

36
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:38,720
Donut

37
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:41,280
Ono Boston cream against the law

38
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:42,560
What what it is

39
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:47,168
Is the Klondike bar but the center is cut out if it looks like a donut

40
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:52,544
It's alright it's alright it's just

41
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,568
It's not

42
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:54,592
That amazing

43
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:58,688
Whatever information myself

44
00:02:58,944 --> 00:03:00,736
I liked it so I was curious

45
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:03,808
Because I was like okay Klondike Bar Donuts

46
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:07,392
They're not just going to make one

47
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:11,488
See any other flavors at the store sprinkles maybe yeah I had to look into it

48
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:13,024
And what I did

49
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,304
Is that what the klondike's

50
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,096
Website

51
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:17,632
The problem with being a brilliant

52
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:24,288
Even with Klondike Bars you have to look into it so I went to the website to see what other flavors there are

53
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:27,872
Important than the reviews

54
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:34,528
It turns out there is a community of people who are really mad at

55
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:37,600
I don't know

56
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:39,904
So here's a review

57
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,440
Austin Creed

58
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:44,000
Distance from mbb in Gaylord

59
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:49,120
Boston cream doughnuts don't have holes

60
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:58,336
I just bought a Boston cream six pack for same sale price $3 as the other bars and donuts

61
00:03:58,592 --> 00:04:04,736
Boston cream doughnuts don't have holes so why does the ice-cream have holes the weight range on the bars and donuts range from six

62
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:07,552
C8 285g which is a 20% difference

63
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:11,136
For the Boston cream at 73 g at the 14%

64
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:12,928
Or 42 cents

65
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:17,280
Lesson 85 G bar also expected more flavor

66
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:18,559
Please send me a

67
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:19,839
Donut holes

68
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:26,239
You're stealing chocolate and ice cream for me that's his review

69
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:30,335
So I found the Boston cream was

70
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:32,639
Just about

71
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:34,943
I checked that they also have a triple chocolate donut

72
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:37,503
Variety this is they review their from

73
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:39,295
Malara 33

74
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:40,319
Don't don't

75
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:41,599
Doc's people

76
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:43,135
Screen name

77
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:47,999
Bought the triple chocolate donut by Klondike OMG

78
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:50,303
I had to go back and buy four more packs

79
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:52,607
I love chocolate and I love donuts

80
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:53,887
And I love klondike's

81
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:55,423
My first bite I was hooked

82
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:56,447
!

83
00:04:56,703 --> 00:05:00,543
Dark chocolate milk chocolate and potato donuts out-of-this-world

84
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:04,127
I had to actually hide them for my daughter and husband LOL

85
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:10,271
We all love Klondike laborers but this one took...

86
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:11,551
No good donut

87
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:13,599
Great combo and they better

88
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:16,159
Keep them in stock for me thanks Klondike

89
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:19,487
How many stars out of five do you think that God

90
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:21,279
2

91
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:29,727
Nope I'm hiding them from my

92
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:36,383
That's that's five stars so down the other flavor is frosted strawberry donut alright

93
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:37,407
He was from an

94
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:39,455
Where's the strawberry

95
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:40,479
Ice cream

96
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:41,759
Ice cream looks

97
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:48,159
Play plain vanilla there's no strawberry swirl sprinkles on it has barely a hint of strawberry flavor

98
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:49,695
Will not buy this ever again

99
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:50,463
Five stars

100
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:53,791
You got a response

101
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:57,119
Klondike Klondike replies

We're very sorry to hear about your experience we would like to hear more about your feedback

104
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:10,431
Dude I would say I think she was pretty clear I think

105
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:14,271
Anyway I had a great time looking at reviews

106
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:20,671
Recognizing their customer base has a real difficult time expressing

107
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:22,975
What's wrong

108
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:24,255
The other pretty clear

109
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:25,791
Play understand

110
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:29,887
She's doing brighten my day quite but that's fun

111
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:36,287
Klondike reviews thinking about like what it would take for me to leave a review of a Klondike bar that disappointed

112
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:43,199
I love it the new album by Thundercat

113
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:45,247
Is amazing

114
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:49,599
Also it has a track did you ever watch Carolyn Tuesday

115
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:52,159
I don't think so

116
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:53,695
Play Stay by the same

117
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:56,511
Shinichiro Watanabe who did Cowboy Bebop

118
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:59,839
And it's about it's about two girls

119
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:01,119
Singer-songwriters

120
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:03,167
Becoming famous that's the whole thing

121
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:05,727
It's really really sweet and in it

122
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:08,799
Thundercat has a song called unrequited love

123
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:10,847
And he's a brilliant basis

124
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:12,895
The Beautiful song but it one point

125
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:14,431
In a fit of

126
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:16,735
Cleverness that I will never understand

127
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:20,319
He said he calls it unrequited love

128
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:22,367
Because they're no longer in

129
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:24,159
Okay it's spelled

130
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:24,927
The same way that's

131
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:25,695
The game changer

132
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:27,487
Let's BET The Game Change

133
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:29,279
I don't whole world is differ

134
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:34,655
I don't know if I experienced it as a game-changer but it sounds interesting I'll check it out and I put

135
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:36,447
Appreciate the recommendation

Alright so you recommend that I recommend

Repeat

138
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:44,383
Deco fine people being petty as hell

139
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:47,967
It'll very harmless way

140
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:48,735
This while you do it

141
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:53,599

A PO for a bunch of sanctions and the Sandy Hook lawsuit

150
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:23,039
That he was at the appeal is denied

151
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:26,623
And also he got his ass kicked off the Android store

152
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:29,951

00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:11,839
If you're out there doing the show and you like sports

187
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:14,399
Or funneling that money towards

188
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:16,959
Charitable causes in your area absolutely

189
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:18,239
Jordan

190
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:24,639
We have an out-of-context drop to start things off here at on the March 27th

191
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:28,479
Little bit long for an out-of-context drop my thought it was really funny

192
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:30,783
O+

193
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:35,135
Play supercalifragilisticexpialidocious I can say that

194
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:44,095
Easy supercalifragilisticexpialidocious as overheat can save

195
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:48,447
I don't know why but if I'm I really I really

196
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:50,751
So Alex astarte's

197
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:54,335
Michelle and he starts on what I would describe as a kind of grandiose.

198
00:10:54,847 --> 00:11:00,991
The year 2020 on this Friday Global transmission are 220 days out from the

199
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:11,743
In the world

200
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:28,383
Responsibilities and I'm honored to be here and be your house if this be the people's Independent Media

201
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:30,943
Human

202
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:33,759
Globalist operation

203
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:36,319
What an absurd opening to this year

204
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:37,343
But you also noticed

205
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:41,439
Starting to use the good guy music from Star Wars a little bit more

206
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:45,535
It says seems to be coming up a bit more

207
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:48,351
Yep so he has the most researched

208
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:49,119
Most listened

209
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:50,911
2 by world leaders

210
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:55,007
The people in the industry I think he must mean

211
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:56,543
Radio Liars

212
00:11:56,799 --> 00:12:01,151
We could be radio or it could be spies or regular grifters I don't know

213
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:02,943
But all that snow

214
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:07,295
Alex believes that the media is saying

215
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:13,951
Anyways saying that we all should be following these these guidelines for public health recommendation

216
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:18,559
Alex thinks that what they're saying is we will never be normal again

217
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:24,959
Station map

218
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:31,359
Virus run its course

219
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:44,927
I've not heard anybody say they were going to be bubble people

220
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:46,975
Jake Gyllenhaal is a bubble person

221
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:49,023
No

222
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:51,583
Don't know what media he's reading

223
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:55,167
If that's the vibe he's getting we will never shake hands again

224
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:58,239
You will never talk I mean I guess you could

225
00:12:58,751 --> 00:12:59,519
You can exaggerate

226
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:01,055
But what's very normal which

227
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:03,359
Just pieces saying that the world is going to

228
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:04,127
To be different

229
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:06,431
Write this is going to change the world

230
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:07,455
Turn it into

231
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:08,991
We're never going to be normal again

232
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:12,319
I think people are just like well The New Normal is going to be normal

233
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:13,855
Bubbles

234
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:18,207
Bubbles

235
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:23,583
So Alex believes that there's going to be people in America put

236
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:27,423
In prison for not social distancing

237
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:28,959
Gets I get to that a little bit here

238
00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:31,263
About medical tyranny surveillance

239
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:34,591
Six months in jail over your properly

240
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:36,383
Social distance that's what

241
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:38,175
Chicago

242
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:40,735
Mayor is saying

243
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:46,367
Stories up on newswars.com

244
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:52,511
Chicago mayor Lori Lightfoot she recently gave a press conference where she was very clearly a bit pissed

245
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:55,071
But the city's leadership and giving some pretty clear guidance

246
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:58,655
Hey y'all people shouldn't be getting out there in big groups

247
00:13:58,911 --> 00:14:00,191
And people are still going to parks

248
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:00,959
Send Hangout

249
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:02,495
Nothing I'd like the walk

250
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:03,775
And what have you

251
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:09,151
She indicated the people if people continue to not take things seriously the city would be forced to act

252
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:15,551
Maxine quote not only will our police be deployed to shut them down if you are not abiding by these orders we will be forced

253
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:17,087
To shut down the parks in Lakefront

254
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:20,671
The situation is deadly serious and we need you to take a deadly seriously

255
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:22,975
Alex watches a lot of movies

256
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:25,791
So I'm going to put it to him in terms that he can understand

257
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:28,863
In Jaws people needed to stop going to

258
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:30,399
To the beach it was dangerous

259
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:32,703
And they didn't want to take

260
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:33,471
Seriously

261
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:36,031
The mayor needed to close all the beaches too

262
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:38,079
Protect the population from themselves but

263
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:40,127
He didn't do it which got a lot of people

264
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:40,895
Who killed

265
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:47,295
Mayor Vaughn is the bad guy in Jaws the shark is just a force of nature

266
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:52,159
Or something recently say that his hero was I don't know

267
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:54,463
Possibly

268
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:56,255
That's not the message of the movie

269
00:14:56,511 --> 00:14:57,279
No no

270
00:14:57,535 --> 00:14:58,559
The conversation about a rest

271
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:04,959
Sing people for not following Health guidelines was initiated by actually not by Lori Lightfoot but the superintendent of the

272
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:05,983
Police Charlie Beck

273
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:06,751
Who said quote

274
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:09,823
The public health order is not an advisory it is a mandate

275
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:13,663
If you violate you are subject to a fine of $500

276
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:16,223
If you continue to violate it you will be

277
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:16,991
Check to arrest

278
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:18,271
Clearview

279
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:20,575
The message that was being sent is it

280
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:24,159
Can be arrested as a last resort if your habitually engaging

281
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:25,695
Babe your counter to help guideline

282
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:27,743
I don't hear that as much as a

283
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:31,839
Threat of an arrest of people as it is a reminder that arrest

284
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:33,631
Is possible as an outcome

285
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:35,679
Obviously with the issues of prison

286
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:41,055
Overcrowding and health within prisons no one's eager to increase unnecessary incarcerations right now

287
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:45,663
Do you have to just kind of assume it'll be a misdemeanor arrest for you get released on you wouldn't be going

288
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:47,711
Write anybody who's doing that like

289
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:48,479
452

290
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:49,759
X probably should be

291
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:55,391
Some stores

292
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:58,207
Conversely Singapore he's actually threatening

293
00:15:58,463 --> 00:15:59,231
People with six months

294
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:00,511
In jail for breaking Health guide

295
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:03,071
There's a couple of big caveat here though

296
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:09,727
The first is that people who violate their order to keep at least one meter apart from people or meeting groups

297
00:16:09,983 --> 00:16:10,495
With more than 10

298
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:11,263
Their subject

299
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:12,031
Either 6 months

300
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:15,103
Imprisonment or a fine equivalent to 7000 US dollars

301
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:17,407
It's unclear which one is more likely

302
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:19,967
The second big caveat is that it

303
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:24,063
Never a good idea to use Singapore is your example when you're talkin about criminal night

304
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:26,879
They haven't notoriously Draconian just

305
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:31,231
You may recall back in 1990 for a team from the United States was arrest

306
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:34,047
Prison

307
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:36,863
A $3,500 fine and six Strokes from the

308
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:37,631
McCain

309
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:40,703
Bill Clinton appeal to clemency and in the shovers

310
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:44,799
Respect the leader of Singapore reduced it to for strokes

311
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:46,079
Yeah

312
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:48,383
Enoch being formally punished

313
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:49,407
With the state uses

314
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:51,711
They also have a very broad definition of what sort

315
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:53,247
Crimes will get you the death sentence

316
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:58,623
Importing exporting or possessing more than 500 G of marijuana 30 G

317
00:16:58,879 --> 00:16:59,903
Cocaine 450

318
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:03,231
Grams of heroin heroin will get you a mandatory. Set

319
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:04,511
That seems excessive

320
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:07,583
If you hear the Singapore threat

321
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:13,215
Dangerous people for violating Health guidelines that might not be exciting news but it also shouldn't surprise anyone

322
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:16,031
It's honestly a pretty lacks punishment given

323
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:18,079
Some of the things we know about their justice system

324
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:20,895
The only reason to bring that up here in the context

325
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:23,199
Alex is is because he wants to imply that

326
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:26,783
Chicago is doing the same thing as Singapore is doing and that's not really fair

327
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:31,391
He's trying to create that that conflation in people's my horse

328
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:33,439
So Alex

329
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:34,975
Continuing down his path

330
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:37,791
I'm trying to say that this is just like

331
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:38,559
The flu

332
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:41,887
And how much worse

333
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:42,655
Fluids

334
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:44,959
And now they're saying the United States

335
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:47,007
Is the global

336
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:53,919
The whole country covered in Red by the model works

337
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:59,807
Less people died worldwide from the coronavirus this year then died

338
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:02,623
The flu last year

339
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:06,463
35000 / 1,000

340
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:09,279
Dad from the coronavirus supposedly

341
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:11,327
35

342
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:12,863
Denied

343
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:15,423
CDC

344
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:16,447
The worst

345
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:18,239
Ears

346
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:22,079
First of all Alex's completely lying about the cdc's numbers from

347
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:22,847
2018

348
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:30,015
Talking about the number of people who die in a given year January through December isn't really useful way to frame things in this kind of conversation

349
00:18:30,783 --> 00:18:32,831
Flu season begins in like October

350
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:36,671
It starts to wrap up in February or March so it overlaps years

351
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:37,695
If your

352
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:41,279
Think about just flu cases in 2018 you would end up talking about the cases of

353
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:43,071
The end of one season of the cases at the

354
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:44,095
The beginning of another

355
00:18:44,607 --> 00:18:46,911
It could be different strains It generally not have these

356
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:47,935
Difficult Prescott

357
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:51,775
I definitely not how they're usually presented on the cdc's website

358
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:54,079
I'm not sure which flea floozies

359
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:57,663
He's trying to use since this would be either the 2017

360
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:01,759
2018 flu season or the 2018 2019 flu season

361
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:03,039
Either way you lie

362
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:04,575
When he says the 80,000

363
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:06,367
Directly from the sea

364
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:10,719
Cdc's website they have to make 61,000 bathroom the influenza-like illnesses

365
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:13,023
In the 2017 2018 season

366
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:16,095
It's 34200 in the 2018 2019

367
00:19:16,351 --> 00:19:16,863
Team season

368
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:22,239
These are imprecise estimates but they're probably spiritually accurate which is to say that the 2017 28

369
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:24,799
Season was more deadly than the following

370
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:28,895
Alex is taking his information from news articles from late 2018

371
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:33,247
The cdc's director came out an estimated there than 80,000 deaths that's easy

372
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:34,783
Which would be the 27th

373
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:35,807
2018 C

374
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:38,879
However articles about this dew point out that quote

375
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:40,159
CDC officials called

376
00:19:40,415 --> 00:19:41,951
The 80,000 figure preliminary

377
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:43,231
And that it might be revived

378
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:44,511
And it was

379
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:47,327
But if you just read the headline you probably wouldn't know that

380
00:19:48,095 --> 00:19:54,239
We discussed on our last episode by flu comparisons are dumb but I wanted to try it here just to show that when does even when discussing something

381
00:19:54,495 --> 00:19:55,519
Kind of irrelevant

382
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:57,055
But factually indisputable

383
00:19:57,311 --> 00:19:58,591
Namely that worldwide deaths

384
00:19:59,103 --> 00:20:00,639
From coronavirus are not yet up

385
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:02,431
Do the estimate of deaths from the US

386
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:05,247
I am from flu-like illnesses

387
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:07,807
In that 2017 2018 season

388
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:10,623
Even when he's talking about that Alex can't help

389
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:11,647
It's all for being wrong

390
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:17,279
Glad to know this is the most researched show in the world

391
00:20:17,535 --> 00:20:18,303
Restart his shows like

392
00:20:18,815 --> 00:20:24,191
It's parody it's it's what you do if you were making a joke

393
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:25,727
It's it's literally

394
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:26,751
Like

395
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:27,519
That

396
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:29,567
That clip of like I just can't pronounce

397
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:30,591
Red pill

398
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:32,895
But I can pronounce supercalifragilisticexpialidocious

399
00:20:33,407 --> 00:20:34,175
It is like

400
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:39,039
That's exactly what's going on with this is really research

401
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:44,927
If you like me saying this is the least hairy broadcast

402
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:49,535
Is the podcast where the host has been released back hair

403
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:50,559
Gaslighted

404
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:53,887
Hey white Alex is started taking

405
00:20:54,143 --> 00:20:55,167
Atone

406
00:20:55,423 --> 00:20:58,751
And I've noticed it picking up more obviously he's blaming

407
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:00,543
China and what-have-you

408
00:21:01,055 --> 00:21:02,335
But in the most

409
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:05,663
Recent episodes I've picked up a little bit of a trend

410
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:06,431
Where is

411
00:21:06,687 --> 00:21:08,735
More blaming Chinese people

412
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:11,807
Less so than the Chinese government's decision

413
00:21:13,087 --> 00:21:15,903
I don't want Alex to do it cuz I don't think you can handle the conversation

414
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:20,512
But I think that you know people have them conversation about whether or not China acted

415
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:21,536
The way that it

416
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:25,120
Should have a conversation that can be had

417
00:21:25,376 --> 00:21:27,680
Maybe worldhealthorganization folks

418
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:29,984
Rather not have that conversation while the pain

419
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:36,384
Pandemic people in the media who were like did China cover up their numbers early on did they act

420
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,408
Quickly enough

421
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:39,712
I don't think that is necessarily

422
00:21:39,968 --> 00:21:40,480
A toxic

423
00:21:40,736 --> 00:21:41,248
Conversation

424
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:44,576
But conversations about Chinese people

425
00:21:44,832 --> 00:21:45,856
And their actions

426
00:21:46,112 --> 00:21:47,904
Particularly chinese-american

427
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:53,024
Real bad yeah and I believe that Alex is starting to get into that territory

428
00:21:54,304 --> 00:21:56,096
Democrats didn't want

429
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:57,120
Stop

430
00:21:57,632 --> 00:21:59,936
Chinese from flying on everybody else's band them

431
00:22:00,192 --> 00:22:00,960
Few months ago

432
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:06,592
Also the Chinese that came here under government orders

433
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,664
M95 masks for the medicine

434
00:22:10,176 --> 00:22:11,968
Stop shipments of Medicine

435
00:22:12,992 --> 00:22:16,320
United States Australia

436
00:22:20,928 --> 00:22:22,464
Celebrate

437
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:24,512
G2 has a story out

438
00:22:27,072 --> 00:22:28,352
Because where the epicenter

439
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:33,984
So we are seeing Alex take this rhetoric in a very disturbing Direction

440
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:38,080
He's always been a huge racist and he's definitely engaged in narratives that blame immigrants

441
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:39,360
Bringing disease on the pass

442
00:22:39,616 --> 00:22:41,152
Houston we've called that out when he has

443
00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:47,040
What do you starting to do now is still an escalation though because the same behavior that he's had in

444
00:22:47,296 --> 00:22:49,344
The past in different circumstances as the

445
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,368
The potential to cause

446
00:22:50,624 --> 00:22:51,136
Different result

447
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:57,024
When he was yelling about refugees from the south border coming in from the southern border having it bololo

448
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,072
He was trying to demonize non-white immigrants

449
00:23:00,096 --> 00:23:01,120
Completely clear and off

450
00:23:01,888 --> 00:23:03,168
But there wasn't any Ebola

451
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:09,824
He was making up an imaginary threat to scapegoat on to those refugees which is bad but not nearly as bad that is

452
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:10,848
What he's doing now

453
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:16,992
There is a real outbreak now and Alex's beginning to act in ways where he's blaming Chinese people for being bad

454
00:23:17,248 --> 00:23:18,272
Like making up with a k

455
00:23:18,528 --> 00:23:20,320
Came here and bought up all the masks and Medicine

456
00:23:21,088 --> 00:23:22,112
These are the sorts of claims

457
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:25,696
They did Believe by wide enough audience stands to get Chinese people

458
00:23:25,952 --> 00:23:26,464
Kilt

459
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:31,840
The fact that there's a real outbreak elevates Alex's behavior from being absolutely unacceptable bigotry

460
00:23:32,096 --> 00:23:33,376
To be an outright incitement

461
00:23:34,656 --> 00:23:38,496
Many people in his audience may have a loved one who have gotten diagnosed

462
00:23:38,752 --> 00:23:39,520
Stop the virus in

463
00:23:39,776 --> 00:23:41,824
What Alex is trying to do is direct

464
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,360
Feelings of anger towards China

465
00:23:44,384 --> 00:23:49,504
He's not talking about the Chinese government he's talking about some mysterious nonspecific Chinese people who got

466
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,552
Flown in and bought up medicine and math

467
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:52,576
Yep

468
00:23:53,088 --> 00:23:53,600
So

469
00:23:53,856 --> 00:23:55,648
What's going on here is Alex's working

470
00:23:55,904 --> 00:23:57,440
Two different angles simultaneously

471
00:23:57,696 --> 00:23:58,976
We also which is traveling

472
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:04,864
What are you literally saying currently is it the outbreak is no big deal it's basically the flu and everyone should go back to work

473
00:24:05,376 --> 00:24:08,704
But what he's preparing for with his rhetoric is the exact

474
00:24:09,728 --> 00:24:10,240
He knows that this

475
00:24:10,496 --> 00:24:16,128
Is going to get worse and he knows the people who are affected by it and who maybe lose loved ones and family members

476
00:24:16,384 --> 00:24:17,408
Unfriend

477
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:18,432
For someone to blame

478
00:24:18,944 --> 00:24:25,088
All indications from reality show that the Trump Administration made some really bad early decisions that have led us to where we are now

479
00:24:25,344 --> 00:24:28,160
So Alex needs to find a way to deflect four people recognizing

480
00:24:28,928 --> 00:24:34,816
Ultimately he's a racist and he's lazy so the only path he can come up with to go down is to demonize minority group in

481
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:35,840
And scapegoat them

482
00:24:36,096 --> 00:24:37,120
For his Heroes failing

483
00:24:37,632 --> 00:24:38,912
Just kind of what a Nazi

484
00:24:39,168 --> 00:24:39,680
My day

485
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:40,704
Pretty much exactly what

486
00:24:41,216 --> 00:24:43,520
Just imagine being a nympho Warrior

487
00:24:43,776 --> 00:24:44,800
Walking down the street

488
00:24:45,312 --> 00:24:45,824
Your

489
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:50,432
A family member has just died and then you see a Chinese person wearing them

490
00:24:50,688 --> 00:24:52,224
Sprite and maybe a nice watch

491
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:55,040
Anything

492
00:24:55,552 --> 00:24:57,088
God damn it they stole it

493
00:24:57,344 --> 00:24:58,112
From me and

494
00:24:58,368 --> 00:24:59,904
Killed a family

495
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:02,720
You don't even need that level of a

496
00:25:02,976 --> 00:25:06,304
Cognitive processing you're already seeing reports

497
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:09,888
Increased hostility towards Asian Americans

498
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,448
Because of these sorts of

499
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:13,984
You don't you don't need the

500
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,776
Concrete A2B but

501
00:25:16,288 --> 00:25:17,824
Discussing it in terms like this

502
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,104
Allowed people to

503
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,408
Subconsciously make jumps in their brain

504
00:25:21,664 --> 00:25:23,200
That they don't even realize they're making

505
00:25:23,456 --> 00:25:26,272
This facilitates racism this facilitates

506
00:25:26,784 --> 00:25:28,576
Nonspecific big

507
00:25:28,832 --> 00:25:29,344
Get tree

508
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,624
Hostility

509
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:31,648
Potentially violent

510
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:32,928
Yep and it's

511
00:25:33,184 --> 00:25:34,208
Really really f***** up

512
00:25:34,976 --> 00:25:37,792
The exact Behavior you would not want to see any sort

513
00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:40,096
This kind of racism leads

514
00:25:40,352 --> 00:25:41,376
To internment

515
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:42,912
Wow

516
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:44,704
Not right now because that would be

517
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:45,728
Murder but

518
00:25:45,984 --> 00:25:47,520
I mean they're already people

519
00:25:49,056 --> 00:25:50,592
Tampa

520
00:25:50,848 --> 00:25:55,712
So Alex is really defensive about how everyone says don't call it the Chinese virus

521
00:25:56,224 --> 00:25:59,808
Which obviously videos call it the Chinese virus

522
00:26:00,064 --> 00:26:00,576
Doing that

523
00:26:00,832 --> 00:26:03,136
And he likes playing fentanyl the Chinese racist dragon

524
00:26:03,392 --> 00:26:03,904
Character

525
00:26:04,416 --> 00:26:05,440
So he needs

526
00:26:05,696 --> 00:26:07,744
To make sure that everyone knows that this is okay

527
00:26:08,512 --> 00:26:09,280
And yes

528
00:26:09,536 --> 00:26:10,560
The Chinese virus

529
00:26:12,096 --> 00:26:13,376
You always say

530
00:26:13,632 --> 00:26:15,168
Where something came from

531
00:26:15,424 --> 00:26:16,192
Rocky Mountain

532
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:21,824
Spanish flu

533
00:26:27,968 --> 00:26:29,760
Almost always have the name of where

534
00:26:30,016 --> 00:26:30,528
They

535
00:26:30,784 --> 00:26:31,552
Originated

536
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:38,464
Alex is just a biggest idiot in the world man before I get into 90s I'd like to remind you that he claimed at the start of the show that he's has the most

537
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:39,232
Research

538
00:26:39,488 --> 00:26:40,512
Show in the world

539
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:45,120
So as to be Rocky Mountain tick fever that's actually called Rocky Mountain spotted fever

540
00:26:45,888 --> 00:26:47,680
The disease is a was initially called

541
00:26:47,936 --> 00:26:48,704
Black measles

542
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,752
Because of the coloration of the rash that it caused

543
00:26:51,264 --> 00:26:55,872
However eventually it was found that it wasn't a type of measles and it was associated with

544
00:26:56,384 --> 00:26:56,896
Bike short

545
00:26:57,664 --> 00:27:02,016
It's actually from everything I can tell it's named after the laboratory where most of the research

546
00:27:02,272 --> 00:27:03,296
Diseases.

547
00:27:03,552 --> 00:27:04,832
The Rocky Mountain Laboratory

548
00:27:05,856 --> 00:27:09,696
It's a largely of misleading name so it's almost all of the cases of Rocky Mount

549
00:27:09,952 --> 00:27:12,000
I'm Spotted Fever occur east of okay

550
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:14,560
Oklahoma with very few actually occurring in the Rocky

551
00:27:14,816 --> 00:27:15,328
Do you think area

552
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,888
It's debatable if it's also named after the fact

553
00:27:18,144 --> 00:27:20,704
Did somebody first identified cases were

554
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:21,728
I initially thought

555
00:27:21,984 --> 00:27:23,776
Because by the Rocky Mountain wood

556
00:27:24,544 --> 00:27:25,312
Exclusive

557
00:27:26,848 --> 00:27:27,872
Which is native to The Rock

558
00:27:28,128 --> 00:27:29,664
But even if that's the case

559
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:32,224
It's less geographical in nature and more about the tick

560
00:27:32,992 --> 00:27:34,272
The disease vector

561
00:27:35,296 --> 00:27:38,624
Which is still not great according to epidemiologist

562
00:27:39,136 --> 00:27:42,208
Professional swine flu you end up with

563
00:27:42,464 --> 00:27:44,000
Unnecessary slaughtering

564
00:27:44,256 --> 00:27:45,024
Animals

565
00:27:45,536 --> 00:27:47,328
Spanish Blues even worse as an

566
00:27:47,584 --> 00:27:48,096
An example

567
00:27:48,608 --> 00:27:52,192
You may recall that as a name that was given to the pandemic flu outbreak from 19

568
00:27:53,216 --> 00:27:55,008
If you know your history you also know that

569
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,288
18 happens

570
00:27:56,544 --> 00:27:58,336
To be at the tail end of World War 1

571
00:27:58,848 --> 00:28:03,200
What you might not remember so easily is it Spain was neutral in World War 1

572
00:28:03,456 --> 00:28:04,736
Which meant that they weren't living in

573
00:28:04,992 --> 00:28:06,272
In the same wartime restrictions

574
00:28:06,528 --> 00:28:08,832
As most of the other Allied or Central Power

575
00:28:09,088 --> 00:28:09,600
Countries were

576
00:28:10,368 --> 00:28:14,720
Due to the need to keep morale High almost every country that was involved in World War 1

577
00:28:14,976 --> 00:28:16,512
Highly Center news publication

578
00:28:18,048 --> 00:28:19,584
Sibley suppress reporting about the flu

579
00:28:20,352 --> 00:28:22,144
This was not a consideration for the Spanish

580
00:28:22,656 --> 00:28:25,984
Yahoo a relatively free to report on the reality the outbreaks going on

581
00:28:27,008 --> 00:28:30,336
Beginning in May 1918 they were reporting more candidly

582
00:28:30,592 --> 00:28:31,360
I've been anyone else

583
00:28:31,616 --> 00:28:32,640
About what was actually happening

584
00:28:33,152 --> 00:28:35,200
Which made it appear that they were these source of the out

585
00:28:35,968 --> 00:28:36,480
Probably was

586
00:28:36,736 --> 00:28:37,248
True

587
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:38,528
No one actually knows.

588
00:28:38,784 --> 00:28:42,624
Definitively where the flu of 1918 came from but there are number theories

589
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:43,904
None of which are Spain

590
00:28:44,416 --> 00:28:46,720
If you're going strictly by chronology the first

591
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:48,768
Known case of that flu happened on March

592
00:28:49,024 --> 00:28:50,048
4th 1980

593
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:51,328
What is soldier at

594
00:28:51,584 --> 00:28:52,352
Fort Riley in

595
00:28:52,608 --> 00:28:54,144
Kansas the United States

596
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:54,912
Spell l

597
00:28:55,424 --> 00:28:58,496
One theory is that soldiers going to war in Europe introduced that

598
00:28:58,752 --> 00:29:00,032
Disease from therapy

599
00:29:00,288 --> 00:29:02,592
It's hard to definitively know if that's the actual Ulta

600
00:29:02,848 --> 00:29:03,360
The beginning point

601
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,176
These are shity examples

602
00:29:06,432 --> 00:29:07,200
But Alex's using

603
00:29:07,456 --> 00:29:08,480
But we've

604
00:29:08,736 --> 00:29:10,272
We do have a bad history of naming

605
00:29:10,528 --> 00:29:11,296
Diseases after places

606
00:29:11,552 --> 00:29:12,064
For a long time

607
00:29:12,576 --> 00:29:17,696
West Nile virus or Rift Valley fever definitely come to mind is better examples Alex could have used

608
00:29:17,952 --> 00:29:19,232
These diseases were named

609
00:29:19,488 --> 00:29:20,768
Prior to the World Health Organization

610
00:29:21,024 --> 00:29:21,792
Ocean Institute

611
00:29:22,048 --> 00:29:23,584
2015 about naming convention

612
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:24,864
Where was discouraged

613
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:28,192
Aziz's after groups of people places or animals

614
00:29:28,448 --> 00:29:29,728
Because it was recognized there was a

615
00:29:29,984 --> 00:29:30,496
Considerate

616
00:29:30,752 --> 00:29:31,520
A considerable stigma

617
00:29:32,032 --> 00:29:33,056
They came along with that practice

618
00:29:33,568 --> 00:29:35,360
Wheatley are necessary and dangerous

619
00:29:36,384 --> 00:29:38,176
There's a rich history of using illnesses

620
00:29:38,432 --> 00:29:38,944
To demonize group

621
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:45,344
People like for instance according to stat news when syphilis first came around it quote was known as the Napoleon

622
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,416
Not at napolitan.

623
00:29:48,672 --> 00:29:49,184
The Apollo

624
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:53,792
Neapolitan disease French the French disease among the Italian

625
00:29:54,304 --> 00:29:57,376
Russians called it the Polish disease in the Polish called at the German dizzy

626
00:29:57,888 --> 00:29:59,936
This other thing is counterproductive

627
00:30:00,192 --> 00:30:02,240
Public health so in present-day it's

628
00:30:02,496 --> 00:30:03,264
Heavily discouraged

629
00:30:03,776 --> 00:30:09,920
The issue for Alex though is that demonizing Chinese me what is exactly what he wants to do so explaining to him that we'd

630
00:30:10,176 --> 00:30:11,456
You don't name diseases that way so we don't

631
00:30:11,712 --> 00:30:13,760
Pointlessly demonize people isn't going to help

632
00:30:14,016 --> 00:30:14,528
No that's

633
00:30:14,784 --> 00:30:15,296
The point

634
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:16,832
Yep

635
00:30:17,088 --> 00:30:19,392
It's it's amazing how well human beings

636
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:20,672
You know

637
00:30:20,928 --> 00:30:22,208
And it also how

638
00:30:22,464 --> 00:30:25,280
Very very very very poorly and not at all we do

639
00:30:26,048 --> 00:30:26,560
It's amazing

640
00:30:26,816 --> 00:30:27,584
Yep it's

641
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:28,608
20 f***

642
00:30:28,864 --> 00:30:29,376
Walking 20

643
00:30:29,632 --> 00:30:32,704
You better than 20/20

644
00:30:34,752 --> 00:30:35,264
So

645
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:41,664
I was mostly interested in listening to the show not because of whatever fun wise you was going to tell

646
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,968
How about the coronavirus what kind of deflections use go

647
00:30:44,224 --> 00:30:46,528
Going to have a backdrop that's kind of standard stuff

648
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:48,064
I was really boring

649
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:52,416
Interested in tuning in to find out what are we going to do about the bad news

650
00:30:52,672 --> 00:30:54,208
What are we going to do

651
00:30:58,048 --> 00:31:01,888
Approaches is unexpected but also completely predictable

652
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:02,912
Do you start

653
00:31:03,168 --> 00:31:03,680
A second

654
00:31:03,936 --> 00:31:07,776
By bringing up how the media always lies about his court case

655
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:09,056
The media's fault

656
00:31:09,312 --> 00:31:10,080
I want to be clear

657
00:31:10,336 --> 00:31:11,872
The way he's setting this up

658
00:31:12,384 --> 00:31:14,176
It's obvious that you stalking

659
00:31:14,432 --> 00:31:16,992
About the stories that have come out about the Sandy Hook hair

660
00:31:18,016 --> 00:31:18,784
Get to this

661
00:31:19,296 --> 00:31:21,344
It's it's bizarre it's really bizarre

662
00:31:28,256 --> 00:31:34,144
On New Year's Eve this year

663
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,936
2019

664
00:31:36,192 --> 00:31:39,008
TV channel

665
00:31:39,776 --> 00:31:40,288
Program

666
00:31:41,824 --> 00:31:43,616
Fox News

667

CVS

668
00:31:45,152 --> 00:31:46,432
Ranch Acres

669
00:31:49,248 --> 00:31:50,784
Jones Lost a lawsuit

670
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,832
Attacking Sandy Hook children

671
00:31:53,088 --> 00:31:54,112
None of that was even true

672
00:31:57,696 --> 00:32:00,000
On a routine basis on every channel

673
00:32:01,792 --> 00:32:03,584
Please ships in South Africa

674
00:32:05,376 --> 00:32:07,936
That's on the little hand out at your door every morning

675

Black people children

676
00:32:11,264 --> 00:32:12,288
That's a South African

677
00:32:12,544 --> 00:32:16,640
Open cruise ship newsletter wasn't about Alex's court case I was about his DUI and it wasn't on

678
00:32:16,896 --> 00:32:17,408
The front page

679
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:20,224
Was just an aggregated ft of AP stories

680
00:32:21,248 --> 00:32:23,040
Attempt to repurpose that narrative here

681
00:32:23,296 --> 00:32:28,160
Answer the question of whether or not the media constantly lies about Alex's court cases I would say they do not

682
00:32:28,672 --> 00:32:34,816
The New Year's Eve stuff those stories that came out on December 31st 2019 we're not

683
00:32:35,072 --> 00:32:36,352
About Alex losing any case

684
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:39,680
The headlines were that Alex had to pay $100,000 in

685
00:32:39,936 --> 00:32:40,448
Vines

686
00:32:40,704 --> 00:32:41,472
Ridiculous Behavior

687
00:32:41,984 --> 00:32:44,288
BBC reported this was because quote

688
00:32:44,544 --> 00:32:45,056
Mr. Jones

689
00:32:45,312 --> 00:32:48,384
His lawyer I'd intentionally disregarded in October court-ordered

690
00:32:48,896 --> 00:32:49,408
Witnesses

691
00:32:49,664 --> 00:32:50,432
And other materials

692
00:32:50,944 --> 00:32:51,712
Plaintiffs in the lawsuit

693
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:52,992
Some of this

694
00:32:53,248 --> 00:32:54,784
Is out Rob dudes fault

695
00:32:55,552 --> 00:32:56,064
Oh yeah

696
00:32:56,832 --> 00:33:00,160
The AP story about this from back then clearly says that quote

697
00:33:00,416 --> 00:33:05,536
He weighed Jeffries and attorney for Jones said in an email Tuesday that they would appeal the decision not to

698
00:33:05,792 --> 00:33:06,560
Dismiss Define

699
00:33:07,072 --> 00:33:08,352
This is because they had

700
00:33:08,608 --> 00:33:11,424
Previously requested that the fines be dismissed

701
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:12,192
Which was the

702
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:13,472
Declined the Alexander

703
00:33:13,728 --> 00:33:15,008
Appealed the decision to dismiss

704
00:33:15,264 --> 00:33:15,776
Fine

705
00:33:16,288 --> 00:33:17,312
That gets us to the price

706
00:33:17,568 --> 00:33:18,592
Because on March

707
00:33:18,848 --> 00:33:21,408
26th it was reported that Alex lost that appeal

708
00:33:21,664 --> 00:33:27,808
And that he was facing approximately $150,000 in fines and fees in this case even before the trial hasn't

709
00:33:28,064 --> 00:33:28,576
Begun

710
00:33:28,832 --> 00:33:30,624
He's going to end up with even more

711
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:31,904
Before this is all said and done

712
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:34,720
Because his strategy is clearly to stretch things out

713
00:33:34,976 --> 00:33:37,024
And file frivolous motion a frivolous motion

714
00:33:37,536 --> 00:33:38,816
He doesn't have any other shot

715
00:33:39,072 --> 00:33:39,840
Because he probably knows

716
00:33:40,096 --> 00:33:40,608
This trial is the

717
00:33:40,864 --> 00:33:42,400
Potential to end his career

718
00:33:42,656 --> 00:33:45,216
But even though the media is reporting on Alex losing this

719
00:33:45,472 --> 00:33:46,240
This appeal in the Pres

720
00:33:46,496 --> 00:33:48,288
The Austin american-statesman

721
00:33:48,544 --> 00:33:52,128
Clearly says that Alex's lawyer plans to appeal this to the Texas Supreme Court

722
00:33:52,384 --> 00:33:56,224
So Alex can get on his show here and pretend that he's definitely winning this thing when

723
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:58,528
All he's really doing is trying to run out the clock

724
00:33:58,784 --> 00:34:01,600
Yep it's probably work pretty well in other cases you know hoping

725
00:34:01,856 --> 00:34:04,160
To become such a hassle to the plaintiff they settle

726
00:34:04,416 --> 00:34:05,184
But I don't think that's

727
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:06,208
Play is going to work here

728
00:34:06,464 --> 00:34:07,744
I think he's just delaying the inevitable

729
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:08,768
Nope not this time

730
00:34:09,024 --> 00:34:10,816
Bedtime it's going to be real concert

731
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:16,960
So he's saying that everybody the media always lies and the media said that he lost this case back

732
00:34:17,216 --> 00:34:23,360
Then which obviously is meant to imply that these new stories that are coming out now are also the same lie

733
00:34:23,616 --> 00:34:24,384
Liza's from New Year's

734
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:25,408
But he doesn't

735
00:34:25,664 --> 00:34:26,176
Say that

736
00:34:26,432 --> 00:34:27,712
That's just the implication

737
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:32,576
You would understand very clearly if you knew the news that had come out

738
00:34:32,832 --> 00:34:35,392
But I was just bring up the news story

739
00:34:35,648 --> 00:34:37,184
It's very weird it would hurt it

740
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:38,464
It's very weird

741
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:39,232
Anyways

742
00:34:39,488 --> 00:34:40,256
Gulbis need maker

743
00:34:40,512 --> 00:34:41,280
The billing out of Alec

744
00:34:42,048 --> 00:34:43,072
Why do they do that

745
00:34:44,864 --> 00:34:50,240
Because the order from the shadow government went out programmed in to the Mockingbird system

746
00:34:53,056 --> 00:34:54,080
Operation Mockingbird

747
00:34:55,104 --> 00:34:55,872
Make me a villain

748
00:34:56,896 --> 00:34:58,176
Why are they doing that

749
00:34:59,456 --> 00:35:01,504
Because when the Council on Foreign Relations

750
00:35:02,784 --> 00:35:04,064
Atlantic Council

751
00:35:07,136 --> 00:35:08,160
All of these other

752
00:35:08,672 --> 00:35:11,232
Globalist organizations tune into this show

753
00:35:16,608 --> 00:35:21,472
Organization of economic Cooperative element as the main corporation

754
00:35:21,984 --> 00:35:23,776
I know I know about the XM Bank

755
00:35:25,312 --> 00:35:27,616
They know that I really have done the research

756
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:32,480
Them out

757
00:35:32,736 --> 00:35:34,784
None of that is private stuff

758
00:35:35,296 --> 00:35:37,344
Grappa just appointed ahead of the

759
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:40,416
Exports in Portsmouth

760
00:35:40,672 --> 00:35:41,440
It's not none of

761
00:35:42,208 --> 00:35:48,352
Google start worried about this expialidocious

762
00:35:49,376 --> 00:35:50,144
Conception don't exist

763
00:35:50,912 --> 00:35:52,960
But if they did they would not be worried about what

764
00:35:53,728 --> 00:35:54,752
They would be like all right

765
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,056
You just going to make a couple bucks

766
00:35:57,312 --> 00:35:58,848
Alphaline pills and yelling

767
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:01,664
All right. So why would they

768
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:02,688
They make you a villain

769
00:36:02,944 --> 00:36:09,088
Because you play the Imperial f****** March theme song like I've got that everybody you like his ability even if they

770
00:36:10,624 --> 00:36:14,464
It's just not hard but also like you know who else would make you available

771
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:16,000
Anybody who cares about other

772
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:19,072
It's really the reality

773
00:36:19,328 --> 00:36:21,376
The way you behave and the rhetoric

774
00:36:21,632 --> 00:36:23,424
It comes forth in the world that you wish to

775
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:24,192
Create

776
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:25,472
Through your rhetoric

777
00:36:25,728 --> 00:36:28,288
It's something that's offensive to most decent people

778
00:36:28,544 --> 00:36:29,056
So I think

779
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:30,848
They would have a vested interest in

780
00:36:31,104 --> 00:36:33,920
Portraying you as you are which is villainous

781
00:36:34,176 --> 00:36:34,944
Yeah absolutely

782
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:38,272
No need for globalist for the equation

783
00:36:38,528 --> 00:36:39,040
Why would they make

784
00:36:39,808 --> 00:36:43,136
Like a Villain and then you just play the fentanyl clip and they're like oh yeah

785
00:36:44,416 --> 00:36:48,256
So Alex said that is a busy the scourge of

786
00:36:48,512 --> 00:36:50,560
Still in this

787
00:36:50,816 --> 00:36:51,328
This rant

788
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:52,096
It was

789
00:36:52,352 --> 00:36:54,400
Gunn by the

790
00:36:55,168 --> 00:36:58,496
Introduction of they always lie about me losing Court

791
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:00,800
Eventually going

792
00:37:01,056 --> 00:37:02,336
Get to this news

793
00:37:02,592 --> 00:37:03,872
But instead he's just like

794
00:37:04,128 --> 00:37:05,664
Man they're so scared of me

795
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,456
Do you have to understand

796
00:37:07,712 --> 00:37:08,992
Broadcast

797
00:37:09,504 --> 00:37:12,320
With the guests and the calls and myself and the crew

798
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:20,000
Man

799
00:37:21,024 --> 00:37:23,072
When I take over the TV station are the tape

800
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:26,656
Elevation of the government's villainess

801
00:37:27,424 --> 00:37:28,448
Criminals and it's game over

802
00:37:32,032 --> 00:37:34,592
The globalist TuneIn and they go if people

803
00:37:35,104 --> 00:37:36,640
Ever pay attention to this

804
00:37:37,408 --> 00:37:39,456
It's over for us

805
00:37:39,968 --> 00:37:43,040
I don't know about that I've been looking into his stuff for quite a while and

806
00:37:44,064 --> 00:37:47,904
I do not have the same response that Alex thinks the people's would if they looked

807
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:50,208
I would say almost the Opera

808
00:37:51,232 --> 00:37:52,256
Just just

809
00:37:52,512 --> 00:37:57,120
Just disappointed couple episodes ago we were going through what type of movies are hot on there I am going

810
00:37:57,376 --> 00:37:58,400
Across Alpha Running Man

811
00:37:58,912 --> 00:37:59,936
We got that one

812
00:38:00,704 --> 00:38:04,288
You got to get a bingo card going you really should get a bingo card

813
00:38:04,544 --> 00:38:06,080
We really should

814
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:11,200
I think it would be it would be used up very quickly

815
00:38:12,224 --> 00:38:13,760
I'm I'm positive of hurting

816
00:38:14,016 --> 00:38:16,576
But maybe not on our show

817
00:38:17,088 --> 00:38:20,160
So Alex knows that the globalist need to make him a villain

818
00:38:20,416 --> 00:38:21,440
And they need to do that

819
00:38:21,696 --> 00:38:24,000
Because once they have made him bad

820
00:38:24,512 --> 00:38:25,280
Bad

821
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:27,328
Most people don't already

822
00:38:27,584 --> 00:38:29,888
F****** hate up yeah

823
00:38:30,144 --> 00:38:33,728
They've ruined his name that make him kill him

824
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:41,408
The populist nationalist Christian Patriot

825
00:38:41,664 --> 00:38:44,992
Mahajan capital letters before they kill me but they do intend to kill me

826
00:38:49,856 --> 00:38:50,368
What about me

827
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:55,488
Human evil

828
00:38:56,256 --> 00:38:57,280
Let's eat

829
00:38:58,048 --> 00:38:59,584
To literally sterilize

830
00:39:00,096 --> 00:39:01,888
Every man child on the planet

831
00:39:04,448 --> 00:39:04,960
Bi-Lo

832
00:39:05,216 --> 00:39:06,240
Children of Men

833
00:39:06,496 --> 00:39:07,264
Oh there we go

834
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:08,032
You be in the mail

835
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:14,688
But you see that the movie to see the scripture saying we should Outlaw male fetuses

836
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:15,712
This is

837
00:39:16,224 --> 00:39:17,504
Brooks

838
00:39:18,016 --> 00:39:19,040
What sounds horrific

839
00:39:19,552 --> 00:39:20,320
It is Harissa

840
00:39:20,832 --> 00:39:23,904
So this is a great moment that helps reveal how little Alex knows better

841
00:39:24,672 --> 00:39:25,184
He's just

842
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:31,584
Mad that the stock Clinic has a wing dedicated to gender since 1989 called the gender identity

843
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:32,608
Development service

844
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:39,264
He thinks that a clinic focus on gender identity is equivalent to them wanting to eliminate males

845
00:39:39,776 --> 00:39:41,056
This is the byproduct of his bigoted

846
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:45,152
The confusion comes because there's another entity called The Tavern

847
00:39:45,408 --> 00:39:45,920
Tavistock

848
00:39:46,176 --> 00:39:47,456
Institute of human relations

849
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:48,992
Which grew out of the Tavistock

850
00:39:49,504 --> 00:39:51,296
But it's been a completely separate organization

851
00:39:51,552 --> 00:39:52,320
Since September 9th

852
00:39:52,576 --> 00:39:53,088
T47

853
00:39:54,112 --> 00:39:58,208
The Tavistock Institute engages in education and advocacy surrounding issues related

854
00:39:58,464 --> 00:39:59,232
The social science

855
00:39:59,488 --> 00:40:01,280
New release the journal human relations

856
00:40:02,048 --> 00:40:05,376
Alex thinks that the Tavistock clinic in the Tavistock Institute are the same

857
00:40:05,632 --> 00:40:06,144
Same thing

858
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,168
I've heard him get the

859
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:08,960
Completely confused on many occasions

860
00:40:09,216 --> 00:40:11,520
And honestly if this is the level of work he's bringing

861
00:40:12,032 --> 00:40:12,544
I don't really think

862
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:15,872
IndyGo bus need to be too worried about him

863
00:40:16,128 --> 00:40:22,272
Before over the years they've been plenty of think pieces written about how women could probably do a better job of ending Wars than that

864
00:40:22,528 --> 00:40:24,320
Which kind of relates to what Alex was talking about

865
00:40:24,832 --> 00:40:28,672
I can't find any of them that relate to suggest a good men should be gotten rid of

866
00:40:29,184 --> 00:40:32,768
Maybe a tweak here and there he enjoys watching to find me all about

867
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:35,840
I found one that argue for higher representation of women

868
00:40:36,096 --> 00:40:37,120
Peace negotiations

869
00:40:37,632 --> 00:40:41,728
And there's plenty of articles that have restless references to lysistrata

870
00:40:41,984 --> 00:40:44,544
But the sword thing that I was talking about doesn't seem like it

871
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:45,824
It's real outside of

872
00:40:46,336 --> 00:40:51,712
Diculous conspiracy theories that basically just grow out of anti-lgbtq ideology

873
00:40:52,736 --> 00:40:53,248
Yeah

874
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:58,368
So I don't know I don't I don't find a whole lot of Truth there but it's so fascinating to me how consist

875
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:03,232
This inability to understand like I really don't think he knows that the Tavistock answer

876
00:41:03,488 --> 00:41:04,256
Student clinic or different

877
00:41:04,512 --> 00:41:05,792
I absolutely agree with you

878
00:41:06,048 --> 00:41:08,096
I ain't no way he's fascinated by that

879
00:41:08,352 --> 00:41:08,864
Because

880
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:09,888
He has every reason

881
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,448
And if and if you told him he'd be like

882
00:41:12,704 --> 00:41:14,752
No they're not

883
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:17,824
Just a blanket boats named after Tavistock

884
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:20,128
Square Where is the

885
00:41:22,432 --> 00:41:23,712
Anyway

886
00:41:23,968 --> 00:41:24,480
The Chinese tablets

887
00:41:26,016 --> 00:41:27,296
Leftist

888
00:41:27,552 --> 00:41:31,136
Again this is still part of the same segment that begins with the

889
00:41:31,392 --> 00:41:34,720
Ramble about the lying about his court cases

890
00:41:35,232 --> 00:41:39,072
They need to destroy my name I'm the Zeitgeist the globalist fear me

891
00:41:39,328 --> 00:41:41,120
It's all sort of in the same theme

892
00:41:41,376 --> 00:41:42,656
Yeah you know yeah

893
00:41:43,168 --> 00:41:45,472
If you look at the CD Granda the Ivory Tower

894
00:41:45,984 --> 00:41:47,264
Family of the University

895
00:41:48,032 --> 00:41:49,056
Formerly of the last

896
00:41:49,824 --> 00:41:51,616
Now they Revel in conformity

897
00:41:54,943 --> 00:41:55,967
On some good mission

898
00:41:56,223 --> 00:41:56,991
Such

899
00:41:57,503 --> 00:41:58,271
Useful idiots

900
00:41:58,527 --> 00:41:59,295
Smocks

901
00:42:02,879 --> 00:42:06,719
Their own world and system they have submission to the tyranny

902
00:42:09,535 --> 00:42:11,071
Definition of ally they're delusional

903
00:42:12,095 --> 00:42:13,119
Becoming Dumber

904
00:42:13,375 --> 00:42:14,143
Dime

905
00:42:15,935 --> 00:42:17,727
They're not having children they're dead

906
00:42:22,591 --> 00:42:23,103
Metric show

907
00:42:23,615 --> 00:42:26,175
But still they delusionally believe

908
00:42:26,687 --> 00:42:27,199
Quest

909
00:42:28,991 --> 00:42:30,015
And pull down price

910
00:42:32,575 --> 00:42:34,367
Somehow they're University degree

911
00:42:34,623 --> 00:42:35,903
As a liberal

912
00:42:36,671 --> 00:42:38,463
Position of power

913
00:42:38,719 --> 00:42:40,511
Vision

914
00:42:41,023 --> 00:42:42,559
They're all going to run something

915
00:42:44,863 --> 00:42:45,631
But first

916
00:42:47,423 --> 00:42:48,703
Submit

917
00:42:49,471 --> 00:42:52,799
The model that they have for you which is an anti-human model

918
00:42:53,567 --> 00:42:55,359
And you ask why do they keep trying

919
00:42:55,615 --> 00:42:58,687
Because if you are following the real human model

920
00:42:59,199 --> 00:43:00,735
By God

921
00:43:02,271 --> 00:43:03,295
You'll be empowered

922
00:43:03,807 --> 00:43:04,831
You want a relationship

923
00:43:05,087 --> 00:43:06,879
The God and the universe gun created

924
00:43:09,439 --> 00:43:15,583
You won't need them

925
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:17,375
He's what he chooses to

926
00:43:17,631 --> 00:43:19,679
How he wants to cover losing his appeal

927
00:43:19,935 --> 00:43:21,215
Rambling

928
00:43:21,471 --> 00:43:21,983
About

929
00:43:22,239 --> 00:43:23,775
Demons that left us then

930
00:43:24,031 --> 00:43:25,567
Oh they're all dead already

931
00:43:25,823 --> 00:43:26,847
Projecting

932
00:43:27,103 --> 00:43:27,615
Exactly what

933
00:43:28,127 --> 00:43:29,919
He's trying to do on to the leftist

934
00:43:30,431 --> 00:43:34,527
Talk about Conformity the entire right-wing propaganda machine

935
00:43:34,783 --> 00:43:38,623
Turn the right-wing into a cult of trump

936
00:43:38,879 --> 00:43:40,159
More conforming then

937
00:43:40,415 --> 00:43:42,207
A 35% of the country

938
00:43:42,463 --> 00:43:44,767
No matter what believing the Trump is perfect

939
00:43:45,023 --> 00:43:46,047
Yeah it

940
00:43:46,303 --> 00:43:47,071
It's disgusting

941
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:48,607
Yeah I agree

942
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:51,935
So Alex is still like I died

943
00:43:52,191 --> 00:43:56,287
I can't stress this enough there's all these does this whole segment and does not address

944
00:43:56,543 --> 00:44:01,407
The actual news at all but you can tell that's what is behind what do I do

945
00:44:02,175 --> 00:44:04,479
When you don't work when you don't build when you don't

946
00:44:04,735 --> 00:44:06,015
Strive you become

947
00:44:06,271 --> 00:44:07,039
Lackadaisical

948
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:08,831
Rough

949
00:44:12,671 --> 00:44:13,439
Obsolete

950
00:44:13,695 --> 00:44:14,719
And ready for the fire

951
00:44:15,999 --> 00:44:18,303
That's why they're building this world where

952
00:44:18,559 --> 00:44:19,583
Humans are needed

953
00:44:21,887 --> 00:44:22,399
Progress

954
00:44:34,687 --> 00:44:37,247
Progress

955
00:44:40,575 --> 00:44:41,599
Understand

956
00:44:42,367 --> 00:44:43,647
Going along with your post

957
00:44:45,951 --> 00:44:49,791
So I think Alex is completely lost the thread of

958
00:44:50,047 --> 00:44:51,839
Seems to be trying to talk about it

959
00:44:52,351 --> 00:44:54,143
Can you just bring himself

960
00:44:56,447 --> 00:44:57,983
I look again

961
00:44:58,495 --> 00:45:03,359
Once again stories of my lost appeals are not true

962
00:45:03,615 --> 00:45:04,383
I feel like he's like

963
00:45:04,639 --> 00:45:06,943
I don't know

964
00:45:07,199 --> 00:45:07,711
A child that

965
00:45:07,967 --> 00:45:12,319
Just got in trouble and so now he's like smashing glasses over there just

966
00:45:12,575 --> 00:45:16,159
I need to get something out of this deal with what

967
00:45:16,415 --> 00:45:21,535
Glass smashing becomes like manifested is just

968
00:45:21,791 --> 00:45:25,375
Trying to yell about how you're the target of an entire worldwide

969
00:45:25,631 --> 00:45:26,143
Broc

970
00:45:26,399 --> 00:45:31,519
Yep and you know within minutes he's about the races and is completely unrelated stuff

971
00:45:31,775 --> 00:45:35,359
I will say however at this point he like I said he has

972
00:45:35,615 --> 00:45:36,383
Not addressed

973
00:45:36,895 --> 00:45:37,919
The new news at all

974
00:45:39,711 --> 00:45:40,479
That you know

975
00:45:41,503 --> 00:45:42,271
Having said that

976
00:45:42,527 --> 00:45:46,879
It's nice to hear him say that what the US did to the native peoples wasn't attempted genocide next term

977
00:45:47,647 --> 00:45:48,927
That seems like something you

978
00:45:49,183 --> 00:45:53,791
Pretty consistently denies because he's pretty invested in the American exceptionalism line

979
00:45:54,047 --> 00:45:56,351
We're all negative talk about the country and its history is just

980
00:45:56,607 --> 00:45:57,887
The product of globalist meddling

981
00:45:58,399 --> 00:45:59,935
Imagine if he was pressed on it

982
00:46:00,191 --> 00:46:00,959
He probably saved

983
00:46:01,215 --> 00:46:02,751
Globalist for trying to kill the natives

984
00:46:03,775 --> 00:46:05,567
It was a noble Forest trying to defend them again

985
00:46:06,591 --> 00:46:07,103
But whatever

986
00:46:07,615 --> 00:46:10,431
Leaving that aside it should be pointed out that on Friday news broke

987
00:46:10,687 --> 00:46:15,295
About the department of the Interior ordering that the reservation of the Mashpee

988
00:46:15,551 --> 00:46:17,855
Wampanoag tribe e disestablished

989
00:46:18,623 --> 00:46:22,463
The land was put into a trust in 2015 but Trump's Administration went back on that

990
00:46:22,719 --> 00:46:23,743
September 2018

991
00:46:24,255 --> 00:46:25,279
There have been ongoing legal just

992
00:46:25,535 --> 00:46:27,839
It's about this but I don't think there's any way to look at it

993
00:46:28,095 --> 00:46:29,375
I'm not come away at the conclusion.

994
00:46:29,631 --> 00:46:30,399
The timing is almost

995
00:46:30,655 --> 00:46:31,679
Comically villainess

996
00:46:32,447 --> 00:46:36,287
Alex in the political world either part of do not give a f*** about native peoples absolutely

997
00:46:36,543 --> 00:46:39,871
It's just convenient to sometimes pretend to care when their Slaughter can be used

998
00:46:40,127 --> 00:46:41,919
To make a point about your own imaginary Vicky

999
00:46:42,431 --> 00:46:44,223
Yeah that's all

1000
00:46:44,479 --> 00:46:45,247
Great Clips

1001
00:46:45,503 --> 00:46:47,551
Service to it I guess I mean if that's

1002
00:46:47,807 --> 00:46:51,391
If you really are saying that right now and you're not then

1003
00:46:51,647 --> 00:46:52,415
And following it up with

1004
00:46:52,927 --> 00:46:56,255
And so we should invest more in the Native America

1005
00:46:56,511 --> 00:46:57,279
Community instead of

1006
00:46:57,535 --> 00:46:58,047
Just being like

1007
00:46:58,303 --> 00:47:01,887
Be they did it and now I'm not going to do anything more

1008
00:47:02,143 --> 00:47:02,911
Like it's do it

1009
00:47:03,167 --> 00:47:04,191
It's exploitative

1010
00:47:05,471 --> 00:47:05,983
It is

1011
00:47:06,239 --> 00:47:06,751
It is

1012
00:47:07,263 --> 00:47:10,591
So Alex gets on with this segment it wraps up and he doesn't bring up the case

1013
00:47:11,615 --> 00:47:12,127
Which is

1014
00:47:13,663 --> 00:47:14,943
I comes back from break

1015
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:16,735
Andy's got Passage

1016
00:47:17,247 --> 00:47:18,271
From history

1017
00:47:18,783 --> 00:47:19,295
That's on his mind

1018
00:47:19,807 --> 00:47:25,951
Thomas Paine

1019
00:47:34,399 --> 00:47:35,167
What are the times

1020
00:47:35,679 --> 00:47:37,471
Try men's Souls

1021
00:47:37,983 --> 00:47:41,823
Summer Soldier and the Sunshine Patriot will in this crisis shrink

1022
00:47:42,591 --> 00:47:43,359
Service of their country

1023
00:47:43,871 --> 00:47:45,407
Buy It Now

1024
00:47:45,663 --> 00:47:48,223
Deserves the love and thanks of man and woman

1025
00:47:48,991 --> 00:47:50,271
Journey like hell

1026
00:47:51,807 --> 00:47:56,415
A passage from Thomas Paine's pamphlet The American crisis but I think he was

1027
00:47:56,671 --> 00:47:57,183
The date wrong

1028
00:47:57,439 --> 00:48:02,303
It wasn't published in 1775 who was first posted in the Pennsylvania journal on December 9th

1029
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:03,583
Keep 1776

1030
00:48:04,351 --> 00:48:05,375
It was months after that

1031
00:48:05,631 --> 00:48:06,143
Declaration of a

1032
00:48:06,399 --> 00:48:06,911
Independence

1033
00:48:07,423 --> 00:48:12,287
The pamphlet was basically just War propaganda to get colonists on the side of the Revolutionary War

1034
00:48:12,543 --> 00:48:13,055
Painfully naive

1035
00:48:13,823 --> 00:48:14,847
Pain says quote

1036
00:48:15,103 --> 00:48:16,127
Highest

1037
00:48:16,383 --> 00:48:18,943
Sincerely wish that our next year's arms makes spell them

1038
00:48:19,199 --> 00:48:21,759
From the continent and the Congress appropriates their possession

1039
00:48:22,015 --> 00:48:24,063
For the relief of those who have suffered in well-doing

1040
00:48:24,575 --> 00:48:27,135
A single successful battle next year we'll settle the whole

1041
00:48:27,903 --> 00:48:29,439
Revolutionary War did not end

1042
00:48:29,951 --> 00:48:30,975
XTR infact lasted

1043
00:48:31,231 --> 00:48:33,023
Until 1783

1044
00:48:33,279 --> 00:48:38,655
Thomas Paine was the Dick Cheney of his time at this is his they'll greet us as liberators

1045
00:48:39,167 --> 00:48:40,703
However there is a passage that Alex

1046
00:48:40,959 --> 00:48:41,983
Doesn't read from that pamper

1047
00:48:42,239 --> 00:48:44,287
I think is pretty applicable to Alex himself

1048
00:48:45,055 --> 00:48:46,079
Pain is disgusting help

1049
00:48:46,335 --> 00:48:46,847
Panic effect

1050
00:48:48,639 --> 00:48:50,687
Panics in some cases have their uses

1051
00:48:51,199 --> 00:48:52,735
They produce as much good as hurt

1052
00:48:52,991 --> 00:48:55,551
Their duration is always short the Mind soon grows

1053
00:48:55,807 --> 00:48:58,111
Through them and acquires a firmer habit than before

1054
00:48:58,367 --> 00:49:00,159
But their peculiar advantages

1055
00:49:00,415 --> 00:49:00,927
That they are the

1056
00:49:01,183 --> 00:49:01,695
The touchstones

1057
00:49:01,951 --> 00:49:02,463
Sincerity

1058
00:49:02,719 --> 00:49:03,231
And hypocrites

1059
00:49:03,743 --> 00:49:08,095
And brings things and been to light which might otherwise have Lane forever undiscovered

1060
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:10,655
I feel like the supplies pretty well

1061
00:49:10,911 --> 00:49:12,959
It's Alex and his behavior the past month or so

1062
00:49:13,471 --> 00:49:17,567
Granted the things we've all seen very clearly in the light of this Panic has Shameless

1063
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:19,615
Mystic sales practices and

1064
00:49:20,127 --> 00:49:20,895
Please disregard

1065
00:49:21,151 --> 00:49:22,943
A consistency or accuracy in reporting

1066
00:49:23,199 --> 00:49:26,015
Those aren't necessarily things that would have lame forever undiscovered

1067
00:49:26,271 --> 00:49:27,807
But they take on a new level of importance

1068
00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:29,343
Context of this outbreak

1069
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:30,367
And not to

1070
00:49:30,623 --> 00:49:32,671
Forget his complete and utter disregard for human

1071
00:49:33,439 --> 00:49:34,975
Well that Candlelight yet

1072
00:49:35,231 --> 00:49:39,327
I think we had a hint at that fire when we knew but this now that it's

1073
00:49:39,583 --> 00:49:45,215
Do you know you can you can have disregard for human life whenever it's imaginary and you're like that could be a thing but now that it

1074
00:49:45,471 --> 00:49:47,775
Real and you're actively advocating for thing

1075
00:49:48,031 --> 00:49:50,591
Things that will kill people yeah that's that's a little bit

1076
00:49:50,847 --> 00:49:51,359
Different story

1077
00:49:51,615 --> 00:49:57,759
Yeah also if Alex could read the rest of that pamphlet he would have gotten to the part where Thomas Paine was not so thrilled with my

1078
00:49:58,015 --> 00:49:58,527
Alicia's

1079
00:49:59,039 --> 00:50:02,111
Quote from an excessive tenderness we were unwilling to raise an army

1080
00:50:02,367 --> 00:50:05,695
Entrusted our cause the temporary defense of a well-meaning militia

1081
00:50:06,207 --> 00:50:07,743
Assemblers experiences naoto

1082
00:50:07,999 --> 00:50:08,511
Better

1083
00:50:08,767 --> 00:50:09,791
He goes on to say quote

1084
00:50:10,047 --> 00:50:13,119
I've always considered militia is the best troops in the world for a seven

1085
00:50:13,375 --> 00:50:15,679
Exertion but they will not do for a long campaign

1086
00:50:16,447 --> 00:50:18,751
I'm with that I think I agree with Thomas Paine

1087
00:50:19,007 --> 00:50:24,127
Militias are good for I don't know let's say domestic terrorism

1088
00:50:27,199 --> 00:50:28,991
What sort of insurgent

1089
00:50:29,247 --> 00:50:33,087
Don't have time for that

1090
00:50:33,343 --> 00:50:36,927
Standing army not so good at short-term terrorist verse

1091
00:50:37,439 --> 00:50:38,207
I don't know

1092
00:50:38,463 --> 00:50:39,231
Betty White

1093
00:50:39,487 --> 00:50:45,375
They tried my point is that Alex doesn't have a good handle on his Source material here putting those a couple of good passages you can put out the

1094
00:50:45,631 --> 00:50:48,191
Tend to complement his narratives every once in awhile so

1095
00:50:48,447 --> 00:50:50,239
According to him he has a PHD in history

1096
00:50:50,751 --> 00:50:53,567
And this is the most research show at

1097
00:50:53,823 --> 00:50:58,431
One thing that he can pack himself himself on the back about is that he did not claim this was her

1098
00:50:59,455 --> 00:51:02,015
So, so

1099
00:51:02,271 --> 00:51:08,415
That's true maybe maybe we missed three days reading the quote accurately gets at least a quote

1100
00:51:08,671 --> 00:51:09,695
I will hand it to him

1101
00:51:09,951 --> 00:51:12,767
For that there are low bar

1102
00:51:14,047 --> 00:51:16,863
It's like when you give a kid a cookie for tying a shoe

1103
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:20,447
For you for you

1104
00:51:20,703 --> 00:51:22,495
We need to positively reinforce

1105
00:51:22,751 --> 00:51:23,519
Your behavior

1106
00:51:23,775 --> 00:51:24,543
There's a cookie out

1107
00:51:24,799 --> 00:51:25,311
Enochian

1108
00:51:25,567 --> 00:51:27,871
So now Paul Joseph Watson ends up coming on

1109
00:51:28,127 --> 00:51:34,271
And they talked a little bit I think most of it is surrounding the idea that you know Boris Johnson now has Coronavirus

1110
00:51:34,527 --> 00:51:38,367
And so they talked about that a tiny bit and then Alex's something real.

1111
00:51:38,879 --> 00:51:42,719
Paul Joseph Watson is in the UK where the Prime Minister has contracted

1112
00:51:42,975 --> 00:51:43,487
The dreaded

1113
00:51:43,743 --> 00:51:45,791
Wound on Tricom

1114
00:51:46,815 --> 00:51:49,631
Covid-19

1115
00:51:50,399 --> 00:51:51,167
Ramping up that race

1116
00:51:51,423 --> 00:51:51,935
Umbro

1117
00:51:53,471 --> 00:51:56,031
Without the sun which actually kills

1118
00:51:56,287 --> 00:51:58,847
Covid-19

1119
00:52:01,407 --> 00:52:06,271
Is there an attorney general

1120
00:52:06,527 --> 00:52:09,087
Killing the Coronavirus

1121
00:52:09,343 --> 00:52:09,855
Sunlamps

1122
00:52:10,111 --> 00:52:10,623
Two people

1123
00:52:10,879 --> 00:52:15,231
I was worried that he did.

1124
00:52:16,255 --> 00:52:16,767
Vitamin D

1125
00:52:17,023 --> 00:52:21,119
Super concentrated UV light kill virus

1126
00:52:21,631 --> 00:52:23,423
But that's not what you get for being outside

1127
00:52:23,935 --> 00:52:27,007
Even direct sunlight over a long time will not do any

1128
00:52:27,263 --> 00:52:28,031
Think about the Coronavirus

1129
00:52:28,799 --> 00:52:30,591
So there are three kinds of UV light

1130
00:52:30,847 --> 00:52:31,615
Abmc

1131
00:52:32,127 --> 00:52:34,431
Is the most prevalent kind that you get outside

1132
00:52:34,687 --> 00:52:37,759
Be the kind of damaging to your DNA and causes sunburn

1133
00:52:38,271 --> 00:52:39,295
I meant see is

1134
00:52:39,551 --> 00:52:40,063
Pretty cost

1135
00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:40,831
Six stuff that the

1136
00:52:41,087 --> 00:52:41,599
Destroys genetic

1137
00:52:41,855 --> 00:52:43,135
Material

1138
00:52:43,391 --> 00:52:46,463
Deal with it and nature because the ozone in the atmosphere blocks it out

1139
00:52:46,975 --> 00:52:47,487
And stops it from

1140
00:52:47,743 --> 00:52:49,279
Ryan you yeah that one

1141
00:52:49,535 --> 00:52:51,071
That one's pretty helpful for the

1142
00:52:51,327 --> 00:52:53,119
Continued survival of all life on

1143
00:52:53,375 --> 00:52:54,911
F*** you up in like a minute

1144
00:52:55,167 --> 00:52:56,959
Anyway uv-c is

1145
00:52:57,215 --> 00:52:58,751
The kind of light that can kill viruses

1146
00:52:59,007 --> 00:53:01,567
Places are using that kind of technology for disinfect

1147
00:53:01,823 --> 00:53:02,847
But it should never be

1148
00:53:03,103 --> 00:53:03,871
He suggested to be used

1149
00:53:04,127 --> 00:53:04,639
4 people

1150
00:53:04,895 --> 00:53:06,431
It will f*** you up really bad

1151
00:53:06,687 --> 00:53:07,455
And probably give you can

1152
00:53:08,479 --> 00:53:12,063
Anyway I was just continuing the string of erroneous statements about cures and prevention

1153
00:53:12,319 --> 00:53:13,087
For the Coronavirus

1154
00:53:13,343 --> 00:53:19,487
But again like you like you were worried at least he doesn't tell you he likes I'm telling you he is trying to get a letter for

1155
00:53:19,743 --> 00:53:21,791
From every Attorney General

1156
00:53:22,047 --> 00:53:26,143
Problem isn't necessarily like that a lot of people have with

1157
00:53:26,399 --> 00:53:28,959
I mean obviously the profiteering makes it worse

1158
00:53:29,215 --> 00:53:29,727
Way worse

1159
00:53:29,983 --> 00:53:30,495
Spite

1160
00:53:30,751 --> 00:53:34,591
From public health standpoint even if you're not making money off it saying

1161
00:53:35,103 --> 00:53:36,127
Things that are

1162
00:53:37,151 --> 00:53:42,015
Will be wrong and dangerous like you should drink bleach if you're not selling

1163
00:53:43,551 --> 00:53:44,063
Oh man

1164
00:53:45,343 --> 00:53:50,463
So Boris Johnson's got the covid-19 Paul Joseph Watson recognizes

1165
00:53:50,719 --> 00:53:51,743
Boris Johnson

1166
00:53:51,999 --> 00:53:52,767
Is real dumb

1167
00:53:53,023 --> 00:53:54,303
Now the prime minister

1168
00:53:54,815 --> 00:53:55,583
World leader

1169
00:53:56,095 --> 00:53:57,119
Indian

1170
00:53:57,631 --> 00:53:58,655
Coronavirus

1171
00:53:59,679 --> 00:54:01,471
Please something to do with it

1172
00:54:03,519 --> 00:54:05,823
Coronavirus victims in hospital 3 weeks ago

1173
00:54:07,871 --> 00:54:08,383
Pretty dumb

1174
00:54:08,639 --> 00:54:09,151
Yeah

1175
00:54:09,407 --> 00:54:10,943
That's why I voted for

1176
00:54:11,199 --> 00:54:14,015
The claim the Boris Johnson is the first world leader to

1177
00:54:14,271 --> 00:54:15,295
Contract coronavirus is

1178
00:54:15,551 --> 00:54:16,063
Just not true

1179
00:54:16,575 --> 00:54:22,719
Bolsonaro tested positive though he claims he took another test and it was negative but he's also a huge liar and an a****** so

1180
00:54:22,975 --> 00:54:25,791
So who knows cleaning it's a giant hoax on top of

1181
00:54:26,047 --> 00:54:27,071
That I know

1182
00:54:27,327 --> 00:54:28,095
Even real Munoz

1183
00:54:28,351 --> 00:54:34,495
What an a****** even if you leave bolsonaro off that list

1184
00:54:34,751 --> 00:54:37,823
Monaco tested positive for this virus and I only know that because

1185
00:54:38,079 --> 00:54:40,639
Alex f****** told me so

1186
00:54:43,711 --> 00:54:48,063
Justin Trudeau's wife tested positive so you kind of have to assume that he probably has it too

1187
00:54:48,319 --> 00:54:49,343
You shocked

1188
00:54:50,367 --> 00:54:53,439
Vice president of Iran tested positive

1189
00:54:53,695 --> 00:54:54,207
What about

1190
00:54:54,463 --> 00:54:55,231
Prince Charles

1191
00:54:55,743 --> 00:54:58,303
Also I know that he's technically not a world leader but Alex

1192
00:54:58,559 --> 00:55:00,863
Thinks he is so shouldn't Rand Paul be more important

1193
00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:04,191
This conversation Horace that's a good call

1194
00:55:04,447 --> 00:55:06,495
Some of these people aren't technically the heads of

1195
00:55:06,751 --> 00:55:10,079
They're all people I would call pretty relevant politically

1196
00:55:10,335 --> 00:55:12,127
Boris Johnson

1197
00:55:12,383 --> 00:55:13,919
The first V number one

1198
00:55:14,175 --> 00:55:14,687
Absolutely

1199
00:55:15,199 --> 00:55:15,711
Yeah

1200
00:55:16,735 --> 00:55:17,247
I can't believe

1201
00:55:17,759 --> 00:55:20,831
Suppose got an interesting perspective on this

1202
00:55:21,343 --> 00:55:22,111
I buy everything I mean

1203
00:55:22,623 --> 00:55:23,391
Flagrantly race

1204
00:55:23,903 --> 00:55:24,927
Real so

1205
00:55:25,695 --> 00:55:26,207
Cautious

1206
00:55:26,975 --> 00:55:27,487
Interesting

1207
00:55:27,743 --> 00:55:28,511
He believes

1208
00:55:28,767 --> 00:55:30,559
There are things we need to do

1209
00:55:30,815 --> 00:55:32,863
Call

1210
00:55:34,143 --> 00:55:40,287
But he also has an angle that seems really consistent that's like they're only going to make White's do this okay there we go

1211
00:55:40,543 --> 00:55:41,823
Not great

1212
00:55:43,103 --> 00:55:43,871
Alright KKK

1213
00:55:48,991 --> 00:55:50,783
We should have overreacted because then if we

1214
00:55:51,039 --> 00:55:53,855
We didn't we didn't take it seriously

1215
00:55:54,111 --> 00:55:54,623
Problem is it

1216
00:55:56,671 --> 00:55:57,439
Hospital beds

1217
00:55:58,207 --> 00:56:02,815
The UK and in London warm hospital already why

1218
00:56:05,631 --> 00:56:07,423
Problem of the rush of new patients

1219
00:56:07,935 --> 00:56:08,959
Been making it

1220
00:56:09,471 --> 00:56:11,263
People who are already here

1221
00:56:13,567 --> 00:56:14,847
But again please

1222
00:56:15,103 --> 00:56:16,383
Social distancing measures

1223
00:56:17,151 --> 00:56:18,943
Bull selectively enforced as you said

1224
00:56:19,199 --> 00:56:19,711
Alex

1225
00:56:19,967 --> 00:56:20,735
You going to the

1226
00:56:20,991 --> 00:56:23,807
Migrant

1227
00:56:24,063 --> 00:56:24,575
Alabama Avenue

1228
00:56:25,343 --> 00:56:27,135
Gangs of them still out on the streets Northlake

1229
00:56:27,903 --> 00:56:28,415
Wow

1230
00:56:28,671 --> 00:56:34,815
Text Mary maybe not even

1231
00:56:35,071 --> 00:56:35,583
Totally I bet

1232
00:56:35,839 --> 00:56:37,375
Muslims aren't

1233
00:56:37,631 --> 00:56:40,959
Sure why not come on out

1234
00:56:41,215 --> 00:56:42,495
So f****** clothes

1235
00:56:42,751 --> 00:56:46,335
To getting it everybody on the way

1236
00:56:46,847 --> 00:56:48,127
The the Dosey

1237
00:56:48,383 --> 00:56:51,711
Detailed like we should have overreacted more

1238
00:56:51,967 --> 00:56:55,039
Because now we're seeing the situation where

1239
00:56:55,295 --> 00:56:57,599
The running out of ventilators of people who could have been helped

1240
00:56:57,855 --> 00:57:03,231
Can't be helped you out and it's causing a real problem the overwhelming of the medical system is coming into being

1241
00:57:03,743 --> 00:57:05,279
So he gets back part right

1242
00:57:05,535 --> 00:57:07,071
And then what's the next step

1243
00:57:07,327 --> 00:57:08,863
Play Muslim

1244
00:57:09,119 --> 00:57:14,239
Blaming them conversation towards like

1245
00:57:14,495 --> 00:57:19,871
Let's not focus on that let's focus on the fact that Muslims get away with everything

1246
00:57:21,919 --> 00:57:25,503
If you were if your argument is we should have done something before

1247
00:57:26,527 --> 00:57:27,039
Suggest that the p

1248
00:57:27,295 --> 00:57:28,575
People who didn't do that

1249
00:57:28,831 --> 00:57:31,135
Should have done it and they made a mistake

1250
00:57:31,391 --> 00:57:34,463
They f***** up let's not

1251
00:57:34,719 --> 00:57:37,279
It's more important to focus on the back of the non-white

1252
00:57:37,535 --> 00:57:39,839
Urban Youth Muslim

1253
00:57:40,095 --> 00:57:43,935
Guitar going now

1254
00:57:44,191 --> 00:57:45,215
This story

1255
00:57:45,727 --> 00:57:46,495
Mike down for this

1256
00:57:46,751 --> 00:57:47,775
Because Paul Joseph Watson

1257
00:57:48,031 --> 00:57:49,311
I do not believe the story

1258
00:57:49,823 --> 00:57:50,591
1 bit

1259
00:57:50,847 --> 00:57:51,615
This story

1260
00:57:52,127 --> 00:57:52,639
Is

1261
00:57:52,895 --> 00:57:53,407
Fake

1262
00:57:53,919 --> 00:57:54,687
Meanwhile

1263
00:57:55,711 --> 00:57:56,735
London yesterday

1264
00:58:01,343 --> 00:58:01,855
A group of

1265
00:58:03,647 --> 00:58:05,439
Undecided to have Alex

1266
00:58:06,207 --> 00:58:07,487
On the street

1267
00:58:07,743 --> 00:58:08,767
Pissing in the street

1268
00:58:09,023 --> 00:58:10,303
A group of six of them

1269
00:58:10,559 --> 00:58:13,375
On the main road in London

1270
00:58:13,887 --> 00:58:14,655
But if you walk your dog

1271
00:58:15,423 --> 00:58:16,703
In a remote location

1272
00:58:16,959 --> 00:58:19,007
England

1273
00:58:19,519 --> 00:58:20,031
Camille

1274
00:58:20,799 --> 00:58:24,383
So I know that he does not specify the race of these youth

1275
00:58:24,639 --> 00:58:26,687
But he is very bad

1276
00:58:26,943 --> 00:58:30,015
Regeneron if you're on Infowars you know how the audio

1277
00:58:31,295 --> 00:58:35,647
To hear that there's coding in the way you telling the story

1278
00:58:36,927 --> 00:58:38,975
If we do accept the promise of Paul's Tale

1279
00:58:39,231 --> 00:58:40,767
I think there's another explanation for every

1280
00:58:42,047 --> 00:58:45,631
The police are not everywhere at all times

1281
00:58:45,887 --> 00:58:48,703
I can be able to respond to things that are brought to their attention in any case

1282
00:58:49,471 --> 00:58:53,823
Different places will have relatively different sensibilities in terms of what someone might report to the

1283
00:58:54,847 --> 00:58:55,359
It's basic print

1284
00:58:55,615 --> 00:58:59,455
Temple is why when I was young I would never smoke a joint in my car in a good neighborhood

1285
00:58:59,967 --> 00:59:04,063
There's too many well-to-do people with nothing better to do than look out the window and snitch

1286
00:59:04,575 --> 00:59:08,927
It's entirely possible that the probably imaginary dogwalker Paul is talking about

1287
00:59:09,183 --> 00:59:10,463
Unfortunate

1288
00:59:10,719 --> 00:59:11,231
Remove nose

1289
00:59:11,487 --> 00:59:12,255
Eneighbors

1290
00:59:12,767 --> 00:59:18,655
If any of this is true and Paul understands the need to react in ways that may seem like over-reaction in other

1291
00:59:18,911 --> 00:59:19,423
Circumstances

1292
00:59:19,679 --> 00:59:20,191
And he Witness

1293
00:59:20,447 --> 00:59:22,239
Is this rap battle fight

1294
00:59:22,495 --> 00:59:23,263
What did he call the Pooh

1295
00:59:23,519 --> 00:59:26,335
Boise wow I mean he's not a snitch

1296
00:59:27,871 --> 00:59:28,639
It's because it's made of

1297
00:59:29,151 --> 00:59:31,455
Or because he doesn't really care about this to begin with

1298
00:59:31,711 --> 00:59:33,503
He's only interested in them battling

1299
00:59:33,759 --> 00:59:34,527
And telling the story

1300
00:59:35,295 --> 00:59:37,855
Opportunity to build up a racist grievance

1301
00:59:38,111 --> 00:59:39,903
Also the story definitely

1302
00:59:40,159 --> 00:59:40,927
Definitely did not

1303
00:59:45,791 --> 00:59:47,839
Let's see let's see how you were

1304
00:59:48,351 --> 00:59:49,119
You should join that rap

1305
00:59:49,631 --> 00:59:53,471
Come on man what are you doing

1306
00:59:53,983 --> 00:59:58,335
Alex joins as they continue this theme in this trend of

1307
00:59:58,847 --> 01:00:01,919
Baja Muslims get away with whatever they want while the whites

1308
01:00:02,431 --> 01:00:02,943
Impact

1309
01:00:03,455 --> 01:00:09,599
Muslim you literally can rape kill pissed dedicate stab

1310
01:00:13,695 --> 01:00:16,255
You're a citizen you're in some super world

1311
01:00:16,511 --> 01:00:19,071
Remote area climbing a hill it is then

1312
01:00:19,583 --> 01:00:20,863
Drones

1313
01:00:26,239 --> 01:00:27,007
A weird drum

1314
01:00:29,567 --> 01:00:30,335
Set Alexa

1315
01:00:30,591 --> 01:00:31,359
Because they know that

1316
01:00:44,671 --> 01:00:46,463
Okay

1317
01:00:46,719 --> 01:00:49,791
Buddy a lot of people get off by being obedient

1318
01:00:50,303 --> 01:00:56,447
The message could not be more clear and they are trying to do

1319
01:00:56,703 --> 01:01:00,543
It's disgraceful I'm going to be is racist to everyone is

1320
01:01:02,079 --> 01:01:08,223
So Alex has a big announcement and it's only sort of mentioned on our last episode I believe and that is that

1321
01:01:08,479 --> 01:01:08,991
Food orders

1322
01:01:09,247 --> 01:01:09,759
Are back on

1323
01:01:10,015 --> 01:01:11,551
Thursday Thursday

1324
01:01:11,807 --> 01:01:12,575
Pre-order

1325
01:01:13,087 --> 01:01:13,599
Thing now

1326
01:01:13,855 --> 01:01:14,623
You can have

1327
01:01:14,879 --> 01:01:16,159
Alex talked about this a little bit

1328
01:01:16,415 --> 01:01:18,207
This is the most ludicrous thing I've ever heard

1329
01:01:18,975 --> 01:01:19,743
That's a good news

1330
01:01:20,511 --> 01:01:21,535
My Patriot Supply

1331
01:01:21,791 --> 01:01:24,095
They run our servers and

1332
01:01:24,607 --> 01:01:26,143
Take the orders when you ordered

1333
01:01:28,703 --> 01:01:29,215
You're right

1334
01:01:29,727 --> 01:01:31,519
Comes in

1335
01:01:34,079 --> 01:01:40,223
Two weeks ago that they didn't they had enough food to fulfill those orders but not more food going forward while they got a bunch of food Bots

1336
01:01:40,991 --> 01:01:43,807
And they got two more factories fired up so that six pack

1337
01:01:46,623 --> 01:01:47,647
Everything

1338
01:01:49,439 --> 01:01:52,767
They're making us apply you food and they haven't gone up in price

1339
01:01:53,023 --> 01:01:56,351
I don't know about that but I would say that this narrative is f*****

1340
01:01:56,607 --> 01:01:57,119
Because

1341
01:01:57,375 --> 01:01:58,399
Where to get their food

1342
01:01:59,679 --> 01:02:00,447
Great pic at this

1343
01:02:00,703 --> 01:02:01,983
This is Miss Teresa

1344
01:02:02,239 --> 01:02:06,335
Surprise you make it and it's about food

1345
01:02:06,591 --> 01:02:12,735
Do more factories and then you suck the food out from the ground like an oil was that everyone else

1346
01:02:12,991 --> 01:02:16,319
Without a food everybody without a food then

1347
01:02:16,575 --> 01:02:22,719
These suppliers specifically only willing to sell to my Patriot Supply

1348
01:02:22,975 --> 01:02:25,791
A relationship where they would have known like all week

1349
01:02:26,047 --> 01:02:26,559
Can get

1350
01:02:26,815 --> 01:02:28,095
Wavy way more food

1351
01:02:28,607 --> 01:02:29,375
Then this wouldn't this

1352
01:02:29,887 --> 01:02:33,215
This is a clog in the drain never would have happened latest this bottleneck

1353
01:02:33,471 --> 01:02:34,495
What happened that I was

1354
01:02:34,751 --> 01:02:36,543
I just don't believe any of that's not it

1355
01:02:36,799 --> 01:02:37,311
It's not

1356
01:02:38,847 --> 01:02:39,359
It's just not true

1357
01:02:39,615 --> 01:02:45,759
But it is one of those things that the food buckets are certainly something like I've mentioned are compatible to a bunch of

1358
01:02:46,015 --> 01:02:46,783
Two different conspiracy

1359
01:02:47,039 --> 01:02:48,063
Panic narrative

1360
01:02:48,319 --> 01:02:50,623
So if Alex is able to bring that back online

1361
01:02:50,879 --> 01:02:53,439
He can still push that even with the virus has no big

1362
01:02:53,695 --> 01:02:55,999
Ideal cities to burn

1363
01:02:56,255 --> 01:03:02,399
They're going to lock you down even if it's not a big deal you're going to be still need the food buckets

1364
01:03:02,911 --> 01:03:04,959
It's probably something that you was working

1365
01:03:05,471 --> 01:03:05,983
To get back

1366
01:03:07,007 --> 01:03:07,775
To be able to sell

1367
01:03:08,031 --> 01:03:09,567
Because it's so

1368
01:03:09,823 --> 01:03:10,335
Evergreen

1369
01:03:10,591 --> 01:03:15,967
Yeah it like I was going back and listening to episode The Bill Cooper show I'm like he's selling food buckets of the middle of the 90

1370
01:03:16,223 --> 01:03:18,015
You know like it's just always going

1371
01:03:18,271 --> 01:03:18,783
To be something

1372
01:03:19,295 --> 01:03:23,135
It works with every Panic week before food buck

1373
01:03:23,391 --> 01:03:23,903
Skier Corona

1374
01:03:24,415 --> 01:03:28,767
Do you remember back in the end of February Alex predicted that Rodger Stone

1375
01:03:29,023 --> 01:03:30,815
Would be back hosting the war room within a week

1376
01:03:31,071 --> 01:03:32,607
Don't hasn't happened

1377
01:03:36,703 --> 01:03:41,311
Diction dislodge that in my brain and I wanted to make a point of like how bad bad prediction

1378
01:03:41,567 --> 01:03:42,847
That was pretty brutal

1379
01:03:43,103 --> 01:03:45,919
So in this next Club Alex retells the timeline

1380
01:03:46,175 --> 01:03:47,199
Of what's happened

1381
01:03:47,711 --> 01:03:48,223
Over the last

1382
01:03:48,479 --> 01:03:48,991
While

1383
01:03:49,503 --> 01:03:51,039
And it's really sad

1384
01:03:51,295 --> 01:03:53,087
Because you're trying to make Trump look good

1385
01:03:53,343 --> 01:03:53,855
And it's

1386
01:03:54,623 --> 01:03:57,695
He doesn't even succeed at doing that you can hear him like

1387
01:03:57,951 --> 01:03:59,231
Really trying

1388
01:03:59,487 --> 01:04:00,255
To come up with

1389
01:04:00,767 --> 01:04:06,911
The next something yeah it's like him running across a little braids or whatever

1390
01:04:07,423 --> 01:04:07,935
Creek

1391
01:04:08,191 --> 01:04:12,287
And you're jumping from rock to rock boys see him trying to find the next Rock

1392
01:04:13,567 --> 01:04:17,663
Mike Adams on the show was the first got a really raised the alarm and I agree with him

1393
01:04:31,487 --> 01:04:33,535
Then they flipped and said it's all your fault

1394
01:04:33,791 --> 01:04:35,583
We knew that was coming Warren Trump

1395
01:04:35,839 --> 01:04:40,959
Did respond now that we understand if we over panic it'll be too far

1396
01:04:42,751 --> 01:04:45,567
This is been a very scripted setup whole

1397
01:04:45,823 --> 01:04:49,151
You can hear him just like trying to figure out how to

1398
01:04:49,407 --> 01:04:49,919
Complete a set

1399
01:04:50,175 --> 01:04:50,943
Better than this

1400
01:04:54,015 --> 01:04:55,551
All that all that's made of

1401
01:04:56,575 --> 01:04:57,855
How does that work with Alex

1402
01:04:58,111 --> 01:05:00,415
Is all idea about the secret emerge

1403
01:05:00,671 --> 01:05:02,719
Cincy declaration the Trump made way back

1404
01:05:02,975 --> 01:05:03,487
The secret emergency

1405
01:05:05,535 --> 01:05:07,839
Fauci

1406
01:05:08,095 --> 01:05:08,863
Everything is fauci

1407
01:05:09,119 --> 01:05:10,143
Chief Albright

1408
01:05:10,399 --> 01:05:12,959
I want to imagine for a second to what Alex is saying is

1409
01:05:13,727 --> 01:05:15,263
Okay even if all that's true

1410
01:05:15,519 --> 01:05:17,055
Trump is a horrible president

1411
01:05:17,823 --> 01:05:22,687
Alex is trying to whitewash away all of Trumps very clear f*** ups by insisting that it wasn't Trump

1412
01:05:22,943 --> 01:05:26,271
Trump is perfect in always does the right thing but his globalist

1413
01:05:26,527 --> 01:05:28,575
Lying to him and tricking him all the time

1414
01:05:29,087 --> 01:05:30,367
Even if that's true Wichita

1415
01:05:30,879 --> 01:05:34,719
Trump is a gullible idiot whose inability to understand the situation he's in

1416
01:05:34,975 --> 01:05:38,047
Is putting people's lives at risk right but he's also a genius

1417
01:05:38,303 --> 01:05:40,351
Because he's tricking them at

1418
01:05:40,607 --> 01:05:42,655
At the same time

1419
01:05:42,911 --> 01:05:43,679
Getting

1420
01:05:43,935 --> 01:05:44,447
Good luck

1421
01:05:44,703 --> 01:05:48,799
Even in Alex's best case scenario where Trump is this is aerobic figure

1422
01:05:49,055 --> 01:05:49,567
He's still

1423
01:05:49,823 --> 01:05:52,127
Wildly unfit to be president

1424
01:05:52,383 --> 01:05:55,711
Yeah this is if you're that easily influenced and you're the greater

1425
01:05:55,967 --> 01:05:56,991
This thing ever then what the

1426
01:05:57,247 --> 01:05:58,015
What are you talkin

1427
01:05:58,271 --> 01:06:00,063
About Alex

1428
01:06:01,087 --> 01:06:07,231
So Alex is still pushing the hydroxychloroquine can help everybody think sure

1429
01:06:07,487 --> 01:06:10,815
Still in service of the fact that it supposedly helps put

1430
01:06:11,071 --> 01:06:13,375
Zinc into cells and Alex cells think so

1431
01:06:13,631 --> 01:06:16,959
Words that ever

1432
01:06:17,471 --> 01:06:18,495
So he's mad

1433
01:06:18,751 --> 01:06:19,519
Because some governors

1434
01:06:20,031 --> 01:06:20,543
Come out

1435
01:06:21,055 --> 01:06:21,823
They're not thrilled

1436
01:06:22,335 --> 01:06:23,359
With people

1437
01:06:23,871 --> 01:06:25,407
Getting unnecessary prescription

1438
01:06:34,879 --> 01:06:36,671
Ordered all Democrats

1439
01:06:38,975 --> 01:06:40,255
Doctor prescribed

1440
01:06:40,511 --> 01:06:41,535
Hydroxychloroquine

1441
01:06:42,303 --> 01:06:46,399
There's no way the governor's would ever outright ban the prescribing of hydroxychloroquine

1442
01:06:46,655 --> 01:06:47,935
Because it's an important medication

1443
01:06:48,191 --> 01:06:49,215
Can four people at certain condition

1444
01:06:49,983 --> 01:06:50,495
It's not just

1445
01:06:50,751 --> 01:06:52,287
Appropriate

1446
01:06:52,543 --> 01:06:55,615
Prescribed for Coronavirus cases necessarily important

1447
01:06:55,871 --> 01:06:56,383
Certain

1448
01:06:56,639 --> 01:07:00,735
Alex is most likely just reporting on a meme that was circulating

1449
01:07:00,991 --> 01:07:04,063
Turning Point USA the claim that Nevada Governor Steve

1450
01:07:04,319 --> 01:07:05,087
Sisolak

1451
01:07:05,343 --> 01:07:06,879
Advanced views of hydroxychloroquine

1452
01:07:07,391 --> 01:07:09,439
In reality Governor sisolak head

1453
01:07:09,695 --> 01:07:13,535
Just issued an emergency regulation that made it so you can't get a prescription for it

1454
01:07:13,791 --> 01:07:14,815
Outpatient setting

1455
01:07:15,327 --> 01:07:17,119
If it's for Coronavirus

1456
01:07:17,887 --> 01:07:21,215
Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer who Trump doesn't like

1457
01:07:21,471 --> 01:07:22,239
Made a similar rule

1458
01:07:22,495 --> 01:07:23,775
Andrew Cuomo in New York

1459
01:07:24,031 --> 01:07:26,079
And Ohio Governor Mike dewine

1460
01:07:26,335 --> 01:07:29,663
Authorized the State Board of Pharmacy to file an emergency rule

1461
01:07:29,919 --> 01:07:32,735
Which made it so people could not fill hydroxychloroquine

1462
01:07:32,991 --> 01:07:36,319
Prescriptions unless they had a written diagnosis on them from the prescriber

1463
01:07:36,575 --> 01:07:38,879
And if that diagnosis with Coronavirus

1464
01:07:39,135 --> 01:07:39,647
It had to be king

1465
01:07:39,903 --> 01:07:40,415
Confirmed

1466
01:07:41,183 --> 01:07:46,047
I'm not sure what other states Alex is talking about and Mike dewine the Republican so he might just be make

1467
01:07:46,303 --> 01:07:46,815
The stuff up

1468
01:07:47,839 --> 01:07:49,375
The reason for these sorts of actions

1469
01:07:49,631 --> 01:07:52,447
Being necessary is that companies Dumb Friends

1470
01:07:52,703 --> 01:07:54,751
Pretending this drug was a miracle cure for an active

1471
01:07:55,007 --> 01:07:55,519
Pandemic

1472
01:07:56,031 --> 01:07:56,799
What they did is it

1473
01:07:57,055 --> 01:08:01,151
Tended to have a beta run on the medication we're just created a shortage

1474
01:08:01,919 --> 01:08:02,687
And this is a big problem

1475
01:08:02,943 --> 01:08:04,991
Because why the drug is used to treat

1476
01:08:05,247 --> 01:08:06,527
Prevent malaria

1477
01:08:06,783 --> 01:08:10,367
It's also used by people with rheumatoid arthritis and lupus

1478
01:08:10,879 --> 01:08:12,159
Those are chronic conditions

1479
01:08:12,415 --> 01:08:15,487
People are panicking and running around buying up all the medications that are used

1480
01:08:15,743 --> 01:08:19,071
To treat them leaves less medication for the people who actually need it

1481
01:08:19,839 --> 01:08:24,703
These Republicans both Republican and Democrat are doing the only responsible thing they can do

1482
01:08:25,215 --> 01:08:25,727
Which is restrict

1483
01:08:25,983 --> 01:08:28,287
The prescribing of this medication is best they can

1484
01:08:28,799 --> 01:08:33,663
To not do so would create a ridiculous amount of unnecessary suffering for people with arthritis and lupus

1485
01:08:33,919 --> 01:08:35,967
Which is a unattended consequences

1486
01:08:36,479 --> 01:08:40,831
Of the sort of irresponsible behavior that Alex and Trump were behaving

1487
01:08:41,343 --> 01:08:42,111
You don't care

1488
01:08:42,367 --> 01:08:43,135
Yeah it really

1489
01:08:43,391 --> 01:08:44,927
Like whenever he said that

1490
01:08:46,719 --> 01:08:47,231
If they weren't

1491
01:08:48,767 --> 01:08:50,047
That should have been an immediate

1492
01:08:51,071 --> 01:08:52,607
You're gone 25th Amendment

1493
01:08:52,863 --> 01:08:54,399
F*** out of here that's on except

1494
01:08:54,655 --> 01:08:56,191
Well that's literally

1495
01:08:56,447 --> 01:08:58,751
Unacceptable Shakedown

1496
01:08:59,263 --> 01:09:00,287
Let's, CLE

1497
01:09:01,311 --> 01:09:02,591
Evil

1498
01:09:02,847 --> 01:09:07,455
This sort of thing it's like what are you ask yourself the question of like why I haven't

1499
01:09:07,711 --> 01:09:08,735
Past presidents

1500
01:09:08,991 --> 01:09:10,527
Said things like

1501
01:09:10,783 --> 01:09:14,367
Hey this hydroxychloroquine is looks like it's going to be a cure

1502
01:09:14,879 --> 01:09:16,927
Why is that irresponsible

1503
01:09:17,183 --> 01:09:17,695
And you reckon

1504
01:09:17,951 --> 01:09:19,487
Nye's Auto because

1505
01:09:19,743 --> 01:09:22,815
People listen to people in leadership and Authority position

1506
01:09:23,071 --> 01:09:25,375
Yep they take them more seriously then

1507
01:09:25,631 --> 01:09:26,655
Maybe they should be

1508
01:09:27,167 --> 01:09:31,007
And so people who have no reason to get this medication will go out

1509
01:09:31,263 --> 01:09:32,287
And try and get the medication

1510
01:09:32,543 --> 01:09:34,591
It'll lead to shortages and people who need

1511
01:09:34,847 --> 01:09:35,871
Need the medication woo

1512
01:09:36,127 --> 01:09:39,455
Possibly be left without and like that is why

1513
01:09:40,991 --> 01:09:41,503
Be careful

1514
01:09:41,759 --> 01:09:46,623
I mean there's other reasons that dude died in Arizona

1515
01:09:46,879 --> 01:09:49,183
Considerations that like are just

1516
01:09:49,439 --> 01:09:49,951
Wheatley

1517
01:09:50,207 --> 01:09:50,719
Gone now

1518
01:09:50,975 --> 01:09:51,999
Mines

1519
01:09:52,255 --> 01:09:54,303
The people who are in positions

1520
01:09:54,559 --> 01:09:55,839
Powerline

1521
01:09:56,095 --> 01:09:57,631
Yeah they're all literally

1522
01:09:57,887 --> 01:10:01,471
Insane there is very clearly making a case for like

1523
01:10:01,983 --> 01:10:03,519
Why did those

1524
01:10:03,775 --> 01:10:05,823
Sort of norms and behaviors

1525
01:10:06,079 --> 01:10:09,407
It seems like unnecessary why do people act like that

1526
01:10:09,663 --> 01:10:10,175
That would make

1527
01:10:11,711 --> 01:10:15,807
So enter next clip here we find Alex being very mad

1528
01:10:16,063 --> 01:10:20,671
It Michael Rapaport Michael Rapaport is said some s***

1529
01:10:24,767 --> 01:10:27,071
Before

1530
01:10:28,095 --> 01:10:28,607
You know that

1531
01:10:28,863 --> 01:10:29,631
Ugly

1532
01:10:29,887 --> 01:10:32,703
That I'm evil

1533
01:10:32,959 --> 01:10:33,471
Alright

1534
01:10:33,983 --> 01:10:35,519
Imagine being a

1535
01:10:35,775 --> 01:10:36,543
Biological

1536
01:10:36,799 --> 01:10:37,823
Android like this guy

1537
01:10:44,991 --> 01:10:45,759
I mean look

1538
01:10:50,111 --> 01:10:51,135
Gutter worm

1539
01:10:56,511 --> 01:10:57,791
Wants Baron

1540
01:11:01,887 --> 01:11:02,399
Barron Trump

1541
01:11:02,911 --> 01:11:04,703
Emperor Palpatine

1542
01:11:04,959 --> 01:11:08,287
No no yo-yo

1543
01:11:09,055 --> 01:11:12,895
In full disclosure of Michael Rapaport is a guy was a long history of talkingshit

1544
01:11:13,407 --> 01:11:14,175
It's kind of his thing

1545
01:11:14,431 --> 01:11:20,063
Call Alex at saying are you saying that

1546
01:11:20,319 --> 01:11:21,087
Forget Coronavirus

1547
01:11:21,343 --> 01:11:23,647
Switch deal

1548
01:11:23,903 --> 01:11:27,999
Cuz he doesn't think it's a big deal most severely offensive

1549
01:11:28,511 --> 01:11:31,327
A person could say how dare you how dare you wish

1550
01:11:31,583 --> 01:11:34,655
Harm upon dear leader

1551
01:11:34,911 --> 01:11:35,679
The Trump wanting to open

1552
01:11:35,935 --> 01:11:36,703
When businesses backup

1553
01:11:36,959 --> 01:11:38,239
And the Fuller quote is

1554
01:11:38,495 --> 01:11:42,335
Why don't you send your f****** son dick stain Donald Trump jr. big tooth

1555
01:11:42,591 --> 01:11:45,151
Eric Trump little f****** Barron f****** Ivanka

1556
01:11:45,407 --> 01:11:46,431
Junkyard Jared

1557
01:11:46,687 --> 01:11:50,527
Let them go out there and test the f****** Waters let them see if this s*** is sweet

1558
01:11:50,783 --> 01:11:52,575
Let them take the cars the trains the buses

1559
01:11:52,831 --> 01:11:54,367
The Amtrak let them play in the park

1560
01:11:54,623 --> 01:11:57,183
And if everything is good after 5 days and then playing in the streets

1561
01:11:57,439 --> 01:11:58,207
We'll all go back

1562
01:11:58,975 --> 01:12:04,095
So it wasn't just Barren it was more of a point about how Trump wants to do this thing that he's largely insulated from

1563
01:12:04,351 --> 01:12:06,399
The consequences other than the rest of us will pay the price

1564
01:12:07,423 --> 01:12:08,959
Of course Alex is the business of selling

1565
01:12:09,215 --> 01:12:10,239
Griezmann to his audience

1566
01:12:10,751 --> 01:12:12,543
And what better way to say this

1567
01:12:12,799 --> 01:12:14,591
Ben is dumb actor wants to kill Trump

1568
01:12:14,847 --> 01:12:15,615
Innocent child

1569
01:12:16,383 --> 01:12:17,407
You even like

1570
01:12:17,663 --> 01:12:19,711
It's in my it's in my son's here

1571
01:12:19,967 --> 01:12:22,527
Pieces of deer leadership

1572
01:12:27,135 --> 01:12:27,903
Absolutely that

1573
01:12:28,159 --> 01:12:32,255
How dare you Greta

1574
01:12:32,511 --> 01:12:36,607
Or his son absolutely not any perceived attack

1575
01:12:36,863 --> 01:12:37,631
On the Family

1576
01:12:38,143 --> 01:12:41,471
Alex will present as an attack on the youngest

1577
01:12:41,727 --> 01:12:43,263
Most recent

1578
01:12:43,519 --> 01:12:44,799
Yeah

1579
01:12:45,055 --> 01:12:48,639
How dare you the children Dan won't somebody think of

1580
01:12:48,895 --> 01:12:50,687
Cheerleaders children not their own

1581
01:12:50,943 --> 01:12:51,967
Or anybody else's

1582
01:12:52,991 --> 01:12:56,063
So Alex gets into complaining more about Bill a

1583
01:12:56,831 --> 01:12:59,391
That's at investor who you think's is short selling

1584
01:12:59,647 --> 01:13:00,671
The market

1585
01:13:00,927 --> 01:13:03,487
Neusa come out that he made a bunch of money

1586
01:13:03,743 --> 01:13:08,351
So he's not mad at Jeff bezo selling 3.7 billion by the year

1587
01:13:10,399 --> 01:13:10,911
Albert

1588
01:13:11,167 --> 01:13:14,751
Alex is mad at Bill Ackman if people have responded

1589
01:13:15,007 --> 01:13:15,775
Probably the reason

1590
01:13:16,031 --> 01:13:19,871
That he hates Bill Ackman is because Ackman had a

1591
01:13:20,127 --> 01:13:20,639
Negative

1592
01:13:20,895 --> 01:13:22,431
Position on Herbalife

1593
01:13:22,687 --> 01:13:25,247
He believed it was a supplement.

1594
01:13:25,759 --> 01:13:28,831
He's kind of an enemy of those

1595
01:13:29,087 --> 01:13:34,463
That's sort of marketing Industries

1596
01:13:34,719 --> 01:13:35,487
He hates Bill Ackman

1597
01:13:36,511 --> 01:13:38,559
But Bill did make a bunch of money recent

1598
01:13:39,327 --> 01:13:40,863
And Alex believe that it's

1599
01:13:41,119 --> 01:13:41,887
Short Selling

1600
01:13:42,143 --> 01:13:45,471
He has not proved that in any way I read a bunch of articles about this

1601
01:13:45,727 --> 01:13:49,311
It turns out what actually happened is that Bill Ackman took out credit to

1602
01:13:49,567 --> 01:13:50,591
Folks WAP insurance

1603
01:13:50,847 --> 01:13:51,871
On some long position

1604
01:13:52,127 --> 01:13:53,151
Said his hedge fund

1605
01:13:53,407 --> 01:13:55,199
Amanda paying off pretty well gacha

1606
01:13:55,455 --> 01:13:57,247
It's not the same thing

1607
01:13:57,503 --> 01:13:58,527
Is short selling

1608
01:13:58,783 --> 01:14:02,367
And Alex doesn't know the difference

1609
01:14:02,623 --> 01:14:08,767
I have no idea if any of the things that people do

1610
01:14:09,023 --> 01:14:10,047
The markets are ethical

1611
01:14:10,303 --> 01:14:11,071
I do not

1612
01:14:11,327 --> 01:14:12,351
I'm really going to let you know

1613
01:14:14,399 --> 01:14:16,191
Err on the side of no

1614
01:14:16,447 --> 01:14:20,287
So I'm not defending Bill Ackman at all but the difference between

1615
01:14:20,543 --> 01:14:21,567
Default swap insurance

1616
01:14:22,079 --> 01:14:22,847
And short-selling

1617
01:14:23,103 --> 01:14:29,247
He's just like Baba blah in shorts on the market that people are at least aware

1618
01:14:29,759 --> 01:14:30,271
Yeah

1619
01:14:30,783 --> 01:14:31,807
So Alex

1620
01:14:32,063 --> 01:14:33,343
Skip back to selling his food a little bit

1621
01:14:41,791 --> 01:14:44,351
A lot of food

1622
01:14:45,631 --> 01:14:46,143
Turn on

1623
01:14:46,399 --> 01:14:47,423
Meg

1624
01:14:49,983 --> 01:14:51,775
Just getting out of the business

1625
01:14:52,031 --> 01:14:53,055
Volatile

1626
01:14:53,567 --> 01:14:54,079
Christian

1627
01:14:54,591 --> 01:14:58,175
Mission to do that s*** what they believe in

1628
01:15:01,247 --> 01:15:03,295
That's ridiculous

1629
01:15:04,319 --> 01:15:05,087
I know that

1630
01:15:05,343 --> 01:15:08,671
Most businesses like to get out with demand is through the roof

1631
01:15:08,927 --> 01:15:10,207
Possible now we got to get out of

1632
01:15:10,463 --> 01:15:11,743
Look I got into business

1633
01:15:11,999 --> 01:15:17,375
Hoping to build something and make profit but now there's the opportunity I got to get out of here

1634
01:15:17,631 --> 01:15:18,143
I

1635
01:15:18,655 --> 01:15:20,191
Kidding myself

1636
01:15:20,447 --> 01:15:21,983
What was I thinking

1637
01:15:22,239 --> 01:15:24,799
How dare I try and make money that's

1638
01:15:25,055 --> 01:15:28,639
Comical so they got a huge amount of storable food

1639
01:15:28,895 --> 01:15:32,223
While every other major food distributor

1640
01:15:32,735 --> 01:15:33,247
04

1641
01:15:33,503 --> 01:15:36,831
And they can't handle the heat got to go.

1642
01:15:37,087 --> 01:15:40,415
So my Patriot Supply had to shut

1643
01:15:40,671 --> 01:15:42,463
Down production for a couple of

1644
01:15:42,975 --> 01:15:48,351
In order to shut down the Alex and then

1645
01:15:48,863 --> 01:15:50,143
After that they caught up

1646
01:15:50,399 --> 01:15:53,983
And they were the only ones able to secure a giant shipment of food

1647
01:15:54,495 --> 01:15:56,799
They are good at business

1648
01:15:59,871 --> 01:16:01,151
There's probably probably

1649
01:16:01,663 --> 01:16:02,431
So Alex

1650
01:16:02,687 --> 01:16:05,503
In this next clip talks about how like hey you know

1651
01:16:05,759 --> 01:16:07,039
I predicted all this

1652
01:16:07,551 --> 01:16:08,319
What's happening now

1653
01:16:08,575 --> 01:16:09,599
I'm so I'm going to predict

1654
01:16:09,855 --> 01:16:11,903
More things are going to happen in the future

1655
01:16:12,159 --> 01:16:13,695
And you know I'm always right

1656
01:16:14,207 --> 01:16:17,023
Hey this is where we get introduced to a primary source

1657
01:16:17,535 --> 01:16:19,327
But I think it's actually really interesting

1658
01:16:22,911 --> 01:16:24,447
Three months ago bio-weapon

1659
01:16:28,031 --> 01:16:29,311
Today

1660
01:16:29,567 --> 01:16:30,591
London Guardian

1661
01:16:31,615 --> 01:16:34,943
World Government needed

1662
01:16:37,503 --> 01:16:39,295
Rockefeller Foundation 10 years ago

1663
01:16:45,439 --> 01:16:49,023
We're going to use a bayou released to bring in world government

1664
01:16:49,279 --> 01:16:52,607
Are on record with all of this ladies and gentlemen

1665
01:17:01,823 --> 01:17:03,615
F*** you

1666
01:17:05,151 --> 01:17:05,663
I was pretty

1667
01:17:06,175 --> 01:17:11,807
So Alex didn't necessarily predicted bioweapon release unless you consider literally every straight thing he says to be a prediction

1668
01:17:12,319 --> 01:17:13,855
He's way more focused on the globalist

1669
01:17:14,111 --> 01:17:15,647
Nuking the u.s. city most likely

1670
01:17:15,903 --> 01:17:16,415
Chicago

1671
01:17:16,671 --> 01:17:20,255
Also the coronavirus isn't a bioweapon so even if that was his prediction

1672
01:17:20,511 --> 01:17:21,023
At the.

1673
01:17:21,791 --> 01:17:24,607
Alex references there at the end the Rockefeller Foundation

1674
01:17:24,863 --> 01:17:26,655
And I was curious what the specific source

1675
01:17:27,679 --> 01:17:32,031
Every time I tried to trace down one of his primary sources on this we're going to release a bioweapon

1676
01:17:32,287 --> 01:17:33,055
To bring in world

1677
01:17:33,311 --> 01:17:34,591
I think it's been a huge disappointment

1678
01:17:35,103 --> 01:17:36,383
I never run out of the benefit of

1679
01:17:36,639 --> 01:17:37,151
The doubt

1680
01:17:37,407 --> 01:17:39,455
Maybe this one will finally be the one that I

1681
01:17:39,711 --> 01:17:40,991
Actually Alex read

1682
01:17:41,247 --> 01:17:41,759
Correctly

1683
01:17:42,527 --> 01:17:44,831
If I went to the video for this episode simply doesn't say with this

1684
01:17:45,087 --> 01:17:47,647
Report Hazard give any clue as to how to track it down

1685
01:17:48,159 --> 01:17:51,231
But there is a good shot of the piece of paper he's holding up

1686
01:17:51,487 --> 01:17:52,511
Which month is a bit of a dead

1687
01:17:53,279 --> 01:17:55,071
Luckily for me though this is a huge talk

1688
01:17:55,327 --> 01:17:56,095
Pinpoint the conspiracy

1689
01:17:56,351 --> 01:17:57,631
Community

1690
01:17:57,887 --> 01:17:58,399
Easy to

1691
01:17:58,655 --> 01:17:59,423
Figure out what this word

1692
01:18:00,191 --> 01:18:03,519
This is from a May 2010 report from the Rockefeller Foundation

1693
01:18:03,775 --> 01:18:07,871
Entitled quotes scenarios for the future of technology and International Development

1694
01:18:08,639 --> 01:18:11,711
It's 54 pages long which is outside of Alex's

1695
01:18:11,967 --> 01:18:15,295
Paragraph reading limit

1696
01:18:15,807 --> 01:18:16,319
Quit

1697
01:18:16,575 --> 01:18:17,855
Here's what this document is

1698
01:18:18,623 --> 01:18:24,511
The people who wrote the report were tasked with analyzing the technological and International Development related issues that could come up

1699
01:18:24,767 --> 01:18:27,839
In the world that could pose a challenge to philanthropic

1700
01:18:28,095 --> 01:18:30,655
Ization a tickly in the developing world

1701
01:18:30,911 --> 01:18:32,959
And the only way to solve those with a biome

1702
01:18:35,007 --> 01:18:37,055
Guys that there were certain things that were certainty

1703
01:18:37,311 --> 01:18:40,383
Such as population growth and entered energy

1704
01:18:40,895 --> 01:18:43,199
But what the report was most interested in was

1705
01:18:43,455 --> 01:18:44,223
Exploring with a cold

1706
01:18:44,479 --> 01:18:45,503
Critical uncertainty

1707
01:18:46,527 --> 01:18:49,343
Airport has a full list of the uncertainties in the appendix

1708
01:18:49,599 --> 01:18:51,391
And identified a bunch

1709
01:18:51,647 --> 01:18:52,671
Things like new innovation

1710
01:18:52,927 --> 01:18:54,719
Global economic perform

1711
01:18:55,999 --> 01:18:57,535
Those are things that can't really be predicted

1712
01:18:57,791 --> 01:19:00,863
Each has serious impact on what situation we will find ourselves in a

1713
01:19:01,119 --> 01:19:01,631
The future

1714
01:19:01,887 --> 01:19:03,679
However the report authors were tasked with the

1715
01:19:03,935 --> 01:19:07,263
Deciding which two critical uncertainties were most Central to how things

1716
01:19:07,519 --> 01:19:08,031
Play out

1717
01:19:08,543 --> 01:19:09,567
They determined that

1718
01:19:09,823 --> 01:19:11,359
Adaptive capacity was one

1719
01:19:11,871 --> 01:19:14,943
And that it could be a situation where we end up

1720
01:19:15,199 --> 01:19:16,991
Highly adaptive or with a low level

1721
01:19:17,503 --> 01:19:18,015
Of adaptability

1722
01:19:18,783 --> 01:19:21,343
The other uncertainty that they chose was political and

1723
01:19:21,599 --> 01:19:22,367
Economic alignment

1724
01:19:22,623 --> 01:19:24,927
Which they determine could either be strong or weak

1725
01:19:25,695 --> 01:19:30,559
You can see how the second one political and economic climate is of particular interest to people in

1726
01:19:30,815 --> 01:19:31,583
Philanthropic

1727
01:19:31,839 --> 01:19:32,863
Yeah organization

1728
01:19:33,119 --> 01:19:34,655
Particularly in developing countries

1729
01:19:35,423 --> 01:19:41,567
So with these two critical uncertainties selected the team created for scenarios which represented a drama

1730
01:19:41,823 --> 01:19:45,663
X version of what the world might look like in each combination of these outcomes

1731
01:19:46,431 --> 01:19:48,991
And specifically what role technological innovation

1732
01:19:49,247 --> 01:19:51,039
Would play in each of the Worlds

1733
01:19:51,295 --> 01:19:51,807
Play Imagine

1734
01:19:52,319 --> 01:19:52,831
Right

1735
01:19:53,087 --> 01:19:53,599
So they

1736
01:19:53,855 --> 01:19:54,367
They war games

1737
01:19:55,135 --> 01:19:55,647
Yeah yeah

1738
01:19:56,159 --> 01:20:00,255
Bhai adaptability week alignment scenario was called smart scramble

1739
01:20:00,767 --> 01:20:03,583
The high adaptability strong alignment scenarios called

1740
01:20:03,839 --> 01:20:04,607
Clever together

1741
01:20:05,119 --> 01:20:07,423
The low adaptability week alignment scenario with

1742
01:20:07,679 --> 01:20:08,191
Hack attack

1743
01:20:08,447 --> 01:20:12,031
And the low adaptability strong alignment scenario is named

1744
01:20:12,287 --> 01:20:12,799
Lockstep

1745
01:20:13,055 --> 01:20:15,360
Is named fascism

1746
01:20:15,616 --> 01:20:18,432
Absolutely

1747
01:20:18,688 --> 01:20:23,552
The 2nd or probably a hack attack doesn't have a positive

1748
01:20:23,808 --> 01:20:27,392
It's clear that the ideal solution is clever together or the world you would like

1749
01:20:27,648 --> 01:20:29,184
Toosii

1750
01:20:29,440 --> 01:20:32,256
Able to respond to challenges

1751
01:20:32,768 --> 01:20:35,328
That's the that's the one if you read the report is

1752
01:20:35,840 --> 01:20:37,120
Nothing and it is negative

1753
01:20:37,376 --> 01:20:42,752
Political science article by clever together they're trying to convince us

1754
01:20:43,008 --> 01:20:44,288
It Rhymes though

1755
01:20:44,544 --> 01:20:47,360
Clever together is described as quote a world in which

1756
01:20:47,616 --> 01:20:48,640
Highly coordinated entry

1757
01:20:48,896 --> 01:20:50,432
Successful strategies emerge for dressing

1758
01:20:50,688 --> 01:20:52,736
Urgent and entrenched worldwide issues

1759
01:20:53,504 --> 01:20:54,528
Hack attack is quote

1760
01:20:54,784 --> 01:21:00,928
An economically unstable and shock prone World in which governments weekend criminals Thrive and dangerous Innovations emerge

1761
01:21:01,184 --> 01:21:07,328
Smart scramble is quote and economically depressed World in which individuals and communities develop localized

1762
01:21:07,584 --> 01:21:09,888
Makeshift solutions to a growing set of problems

1763
01:21:10,400 --> 01:21:11,936
Lockstep is quote a world

1764
01:21:12,192 --> 01:21:13,472
Tighter top-down government

1765
01:21:13,728 --> 01:21:15,520
Control and more authoritarian leadership

1766
01:21:15,776 --> 01:21:16,800
With limited innovation

1767
01:21:17,312 --> 01:21:18,336
Ingrowing citizen pushp

1768
01:21:19,616 --> 01:21:20,128
The website

1769
01:21:20,384 --> 01:21:24,224
To push this document is being about the Rockefeller Foundation planning to use a bio-weapon

1770
01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:26,528
To bring in a world government are inherently full of s***

1771
01:21:27,040 --> 01:21:29,088
Because what they're doing is cherry-picking lines

1772
01:21:29,344 --> 01:21:30,880
From the four different scenarios and

1773
01:21:31,136 --> 01:21:31,904
Pretending it's all one

1774
01:21:32,160 --> 01:21:32,672
Plan

1775
01:21:32,928 --> 01:21:34,720
However most of it is from the locks

1776
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:39,072
Because that's the one where there's a rise of top down

1777
01:21:39,328 --> 01:21:40,096
Authoritarian Sissy

1778
01:21:41,632 --> 01:21:47,520
The authors of this report imagine that an instigating event for that scenario could be a global pandemic

1779
01:21:48,032 --> 01:21:52,640
Where the need for greater social structure to fight an outbreak could be exploited by leaders who want that kind

1780
01:21:52,896 --> 01:21:53,408
Kind of power

1781
01:21:53,920 --> 01:21:54,944
It's presented as a

1782
01:21:55,200 --> 01:21:55,968
Not good outcome

1783
01:21:56,224 --> 01:21:59,808
DB like some sort of Department of Justice wanting to indefinitely

1784
01:22:00,064 --> 01:22:02,112
Detain people without worrying about them going to

1785
01:22:02,368 --> 01:22:03,904
Oh no no no no

1786
01:22:04,160 --> 01:22:06,464
Sorry I was just thinking that

1787
01:22:06,720 --> 01:22:11,072
Random out of the blue just like thoughts that could never possibly happen

1788
01:22:11,328 --> 01:22:13,632
It's like I said it's presented as a not good out

1789
01:22:14,144 --> 01:22:15,168
And you don't want that

1790
01:22:15,424 --> 01:22:16,960
And ultimately in that scenario

1791
01:22:17,216 --> 01:22:18,496
There's no world government

1792
01:22:18,752 --> 01:22:19,776
It's only dictator

1793
01:22:20,032 --> 01:22:22,848
In many countries and some uneasy Regional alliances

1794
01:22:23,104 --> 01:22:26,176
Is with uneasy populations at the point of uprising

1795
01:22:26,432 --> 01:22:31,296
That's where that scenario plays out to it doesn't end in a world government

1796
01:22:31,808 --> 01:22:35,648
The government in shambles I believe in rubble and Meyers

1797
01:22:36,160 --> 01:22:38,720
Conspiracy sites like that the scenario starts with a pandemic

1798
01:22:39,232 --> 01:22:40,512
But it doesn't end the way they wanted

1799
01:22:41,024 --> 01:22:42,048
It just doesn't make

1800
01:22:42,304 --> 01:22:43,072
The point they want

1801
01:22:44,352 --> 01:22:46,912
Pieces out of each of the scenarios to create collage of something

1802
01:22:47,168 --> 01:22:48,704
It kind of sounds like something they can work with

1803
01:22:49,472 --> 01:22:54,080
The clever together scenario involves Global Collective action about climate change

1804
01:22:54,336 --> 01:22:55,616
So they toss that in there

1805
01:22:56,640 --> 01:22:59,200
The problem is that literally none of these scenarios involved

1806
01:22:59,456 --> 01:22:59,968
Louisiana Bayou

1807
01:23:00,224 --> 01:23:02,272
My weapon and none of them resulted world government

1808
01:23:02,784 --> 01:23:04,064
The only way to reach that conclusion

1809
01:23:04,576 --> 01:23:08,416
Completely twist the words on the page of the point where you might as well just be rewriting the report to

1810
01:23:08,672 --> 01:23:09,184
Suit your purposes

1811
01:23:09,696 --> 01:23:10,208
What is what they're doing

1812
01:23:10,464 --> 01:23:11,488
I don't like what

1813
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:12,512
Report says

1814
01:23:12,768 --> 01:23:14,048
But it does come from

1815
01:23:14,304 --> 01:23:20,448
A place that I hate so how about I just lie about

1816
01:23:20,704 --> 01:23:23,776
Close enough for Horseshoes and Hand Grenades

1817
01:23:24,288 --> 01:23:30,432
I read over the document and it in no way demonstrates that the Rockefeller Foundation admitted that they wanted to release by 11 to bring in the world

1818
01:23:30,944 --> 01:23:32,224
That's absolutely ludicrous

1819
01:23:32,480 --> 01:23:34,272
Something I definitely would not expect

1820
01:23:34,528 --> 01:23:37,088
Epicure on the most research show in the world

1821
01:23:38,112 --> 01:23:38,624
I guess this was

1822
01:23:38,880 --> 01:23:40,672
The time but Alex it actually read the doctor

1823
01:23:41,184 --> 01:23:44,000
Correctly but supercalifragilistic

1824
01:23:44,256 --> 01:23:45,024
Expedia

1825
01:23:45,280 --> 01:23:47,584
I will get my hopes up again

1826
01:23:48,096 --> 01:23:48,608
Good luck

1827
01:23:48,864 --> 01:23:49,888
Also

1828
01:23:50,656 --> 01:23:53,984
You know how I keep mentioning that is really popular on conspiracy theory sites

1829
01:23:54,496 --> 01:23:56,288
It's not that popular I was kind of lying

1830
01:23:56,800 --> 01:23:59,104
It's pop it's not that popular the contacts Alex's using

1831
01:23:59,616 --> 01:24:01,664
However the most prominent site pushing

1832
01:24:01,920 --> 01:24:02,432
Narrative

1833
01:24:02,688 --> 01:24:08,832
Is Jim Fetzer blog might be the case that Alex is using his old holocaust-denying buddy facts

1834
01:24:09,088 --> 01:24:13,440
There is a source again that in the Sandy Hook

1835
01:24:13,696 --> 01:24:15,488
Okay so you said you said

1836
01:24:15,744 --> 01:24:21,888
F****** dumb look like like like you say it's a bad thing people say the definition of insanity is doing

1837
01:24:22,144 --> 01:24:24,960
In the same thing over and over and over again expecting different results

1838
01:24:25,216 --> 01:24:26,496
But they haven't met Spencer

1839
01:24:26,752 --> 01:24:27,520
He's too good

1840
01:24:27,776 --> 01:24:28,800
He's not too good

1841
01:24:29,056 --> 01:24:29,568
I should be

1842
01:24:29,824 --> 01:24:35,968
Beef are you Michael Jones is also pushing this document new Holocaust denier

1843
01:24:36,224 --> 01:24:37,504
Canker sores

1844
01:24:37,760 --> 01:24:40,832
Hey anti-Semitism is a good fall back

1845
01:24:41,088 --> 01:24:43,136
Plan whenever anything is going bad

1846
01:24:43,648 --> 01:24:48,768
So as Alex is going out to break easy cited these this headline in this report

1847
01:24:49,024 --> 01:24:49,792
And he says this

1848
01:24:50,048 --> 01:24:51,072
Where is my article

1849
01:24:52,864 --> 01:24:56,448
Laid out scenario where virus outbreak Prime storage area Crackdown

1850
01:24:56,704 --> 01:24:57,728
I'll get more into this

1851
01:24:58,240 --> 01:24:59,008
Furniture phone call

1852
01:24:59,520 --> 01:25:00,800
So he's going out to break

1853
01:25:01,056 --> 01:25:02,848
You read that other headline

1854
01:25:03,104 --> 01:25:08,480
Mickey's meaning to suggest this globalist think tank is a different story than the one about the Rockefeller Foundation

1855
01:25:08,992 --> 01:25:10,528
What is the same headline he just read

1856
01:25:11,040 --> 01:25:11,552
Acceptance

1857
01:25:11,808 --> 01:25:14,112
Infowars write-up of nothing

1858
01:25:15,136 --> 01:25:18,720
This one is written by a dawn Salazar our former Twitter followers

1859
01:25:18,976 --> 01:25:21,536
Marks of intentional lion

1860
01:25:22,048 --> 01:25:24,352
The one here's the first paragraph of his article

1861
01:25:24,608 --> 01:25:27,936
Bible Eyre I lie all the time as well babe

1862
01:25:28,448 --> 01:25:32,800
Rockefeller Foundation report produced 10 years ago imagine to viral pandemic is

1863
01:25:33,056 --> 01:25:34,592
The perfect Catalyst Implement quote

1864
01:25:35,104 --> 01:25:36,128
Titer top down

1865
01:25:36,640 --> 01:25:37,408
God

1866
01:25:37,664 --> 01:25:39,456
It control it more authoritarian leadership

1867
01:25:39,712 --> 01:25:45,856
Eerily similar to what's on folding during our current coronavirus outbreak they also included that celeb

1868
01:25:46,112 --> 01:25:47,136
Havertys would all sing imagine

1869
01:25:49,696 --> 01:25:51,488
The report doesn't imagine a viral

1870
01:25:51,744 --> 01:25:52,512
Pandemic is a perfect

1871
01:25:52,768 --> 01:25:54,816
Catalyst Implement tighter top-down government

1872
01:25:55,072 --> 01:25:56,608
Controlling more authoritarian leadership

1873
01:25:57,632 --> 01:25:59,680
Physic incredibly unfair characterization

1874
01:25:59,936 --> 01:26:01,216
The document because that framing

1875
01:26:01,472 --> 01:26:04,800
Suggest they were trying to find a way to implement authoritarian leadership

1876
01:26:05,056 --> 01:26:06,848
And the virus was the perfect way to do it

1877
01:26:07,104 --> 01:26:10,688
Instead of actively looking for a way to stop the authoritarian leadership

1878
01:26:10,944 --> 01:26:13,504
That's just a complete misreading of the point of

1879
01:26:14,016 --> 01:26:20,160
I'm not sure necessarily that it is actually even about stopping authoritarian leadership

1880
01:26:20,416 --> 01:26:20,928
If that

1881
01:26:21,184 --> 01:26:25,280
He's the world that ends up coming into being what are the challenges that Alex

1882
01:26:25,536 --> 01:26:26,304
Exist

1883
01:26:26,560 --> 01:26:28,864
From of philanthropic developing world

1884
01:26:29,120 --> 01:26:29,888
Situation

1885
01:26:30,144 --> 01:26:31,168
Most importantly

1886
01:26:31,424 --> 01:26:32,704
What are the ways in which Tech

1887
01:26:32,960 --> 01:26:33,984
Technological innovation

1888
01:26:34,240 --> 01:26:35,264
Will be used

1889
01:26:35,776 --> 01:26:36,288
DMVs

1890
01:26:36,544 --> 01:26:38,080
Four different type of

1891
01:26:38,336 --> 01:26:39,616
Society we find ourselves in

1892
01:26:39,872 --> 01:26:41,920
Right so that's really

1893
01:26:42,176 --> 01:26:42,688
What

1894
01:26:42,944 --> 01:26:46,272
The report is by it's not about the authoritarian system

1895
01:26:46,528 --> 01:26:50,880
Trinity's also most definitely not about how do we bring it in to grab it right

1896
01:26:51,904 --> 01:26:52,672
It's easy to

1897
01:26:52,928 --> 01:26:56,000
Forget that the Rockefeller Rockefeller Foundation is a charity

1898
01:26:56,256 --> 01:26:58,304
Yeah not a evil organization

1899
01:26:58,560 --> 01:27:01,888
They shouldn't say it so many times it must be true

1900
01:27:02,144 --> 01:27:07,776
So the goal like like a touchdown there is discussing how technological progress would likely develop in these four.

1901
01:27:08,032 --> 01:27:08,544
Scenarios

1902
01:27:08,800 --> 01:27:13,408
And wanted on and all of the right-wing dum-dums of glommed onto is the one that happens to be about

1903
01:27:13,664 --> 01:27:18,528
How technology would possibly progressed in a world where we have a low level of adaptability

1904
01:27:18,784 --> 01:27:19,808
Any strong Alliance

1905
01:27:20,064 --> 01:27:22,880
Mint between politics and the economy the one that their act

1906
01:27:23,136 --> 01:27:23,648
If we trying to bring

1907
01:27:25,696 --> 01:27:30,816
The world the author's Invision Envision with those two qualities would be one with a more authoritarian bent

1908
01:27:31,072 --> 01:27:32,608
To a setup where they

1909
01:27:32,864 --> 01:27:33,632
Creative flourish

1910
01:27:34,144 --> 01:27:34,912
Of how they decided to

1911
01:27:35,168 --> 01:27:36,704
To give that scenario a backstory

1912
01:27:37,216 --> 01:27:38,752
These scenarios are meant to be stopped

1913
01:27:39,008 --> 01:27:40,032
Provoking and meant to prompt

1914
01:27:40,288 --> 01:27:40,800
The conversation

1915
01:27:41,312 --> 01:27:43,360
And as such there written hyper dramatically

1916
01:27:43,872 --> 01:27:44,896
Each one is giving a

1917
01:27:45,152 --> 01:27:49,248
Given a needlessly intense backstory about how the circumstances of the world

1918
01:27:49,504 --> 01:27:50,016
It depicts

1919
01:27:50,272 --> 01:27:51,040
Came into being

1920
01:27:51,808 --> 01:27:54,368
For instance we hack attack scenario starts like this

1921
01:27:54,880 --> 01:27:57,184
Devastating shocks like September

1922
01:27:57,696 --> 01:27:59,744
The Southeast Asian tsunami of 2000

1923
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:01,792
For in the 2010 Haiti earthquake

1924
01:28:02,048 --> 01:28:04,096
It certainly Prime the world for sudden disaster

1925
01:28:04,864 --> 01:28:07,680
But no one was prepared for a world in which large scale

1926
01:28:08,192 --> 01:28:08,960
Catastrophes

1927
01:28:09,216 --> 01:28:09,984
Whitaker would suck

1928
01:28:10,240 --> 01:28:11,520
Breakup breathtaking

1929
01:28:11,776 --> 01:28:12,288
Frequency

1930
01:28:13,056 --> 01:28:16,128
The years 2010 to 2020 word of the Doom decade

1931
01:28:16,384 --> 01:28:16,896
For good reason

1932
01:28:17,664 --> 01:28:20,224
The 2012 Olympic bombing which killed 30

1933
01:28:20,480 --> 01:28:22,528
2000 was followed closely by an earthquake in

1934
01:28:22,784 --> 01:28:23,552
Indonesia killing

1935
01:28:23,808 --> 01:28:24,320
40000

1936
01:28:24,832 --> 01:28:27,136
A tsunami that almost wiped out Nicaragua

1937
01:28:27,392 --> 01:28:28,928
And the onset of the West

1938
01:28:29,184 --> 01:28:29,696
China famine

1939
01:28:29,952 --> 01:28:32,000
Which caused a once in a Lenny and drought

1940
01:28:32,256 --> 01:28:32,768
Climate change

1941
01:28:34,560 --> 01:28:36,864
The goal of this scenario is to create a world that is

1942
01:28:37,120 --> 01:28:37,632
Full of Chaos

1943
01:28:38,144 --> 01:28:39,680
Where the power of government is weekend

1944
01:28:39,936 --> 01:28:41,216
And adaptability is low

1945
01:28:41,984 --> 01:28:44,288
This is the story they decided to use to launch into that

1946
01:28:44,544 --> 01:28:46,080
And it's built on some real thing

1947
01:28:46,336 --> 01:28:47,616
Like the disasters that happened

1948
01:28:47,872 --> 01:28:49,152
Prior to the report writing

1949
01:28:49,408 --> 01:28:50,176
2010

1950
01:28:50,432 --> 01:28:51,712
Anime augmented with

1951
01:28:51,968 --> 01:28:53,248
Fictitious real-world events

1952
01:28:53,504 --> 01:28:54,272
Like the Olympics

1953
01:28:54,528 --> 01:28:56,320
Bombing the didn't happen in 2012

1954
01:28:56,576 --> 01:28:57,600
I was going to say I didn't remember

1955
01:28:57,856 --> 01:28:58,368
For that 10

1956
01:28:58,880 --> 01:29:01,184
The things that they're used as pieces the world they're building

1957
01:29:01,440 --> 01:29:02,976
Wingfield sort of real though

1958
01:29:03,488 --> 01:29:04,256
Because they're plausible

1959
01:29:05,024 --> 01:29:07,328
There was a bomb at the Olympics in 1996

1960
01:29:07,840 --> 01:29:09,376
Indonesia had a gigantic

1961
01:29:09,632 --> 01:29:13,984
9 + earthquake in 2004 left over 200,000 people dead

1962
01:29:14,240 --> 01:29:17,824
Nicaragua was the site of a notable tsunami in 1992

1963
01:29:18,080 --> 01:29:20,128
China does have a history of severe drought

1964
01:29:20,640 --> 01:29:23,712
All of these things are not real to the people who write in the report

1965
01:29:23,968 --> 01:29:24,736
But they're things

1966
01:29:24,992 --> 01:29:26,528
Could happen in the real world

1967
01:29:26,784 --> 01:29:27,552
Any of those things

1968
01:29:27,808 --> 01:29:28,320
Could happen

1969
01:29:28,576 --> 01:29:31,392
But if they did it would have no bearing on the intention

1970
01:29:31,648 --> 01:29:34,464
Or predictive nest of the writing of the report

1971
01:29:34,976 --> 01:29:39,584
The same is true of the virus pandemic that's the setup for the scenario that there

1972
01:29:40,096 --> 01:29:41,376
Conspiracy right-wing is obsessed

1973
01:29:42,400 --> 01:29:45,472
It is a viral outbreak which relies on the H1 N1

1974
01:29:45,728 --> 01:29:48,288
Pandemic from the previous year 2009

1975
01:29:48,544 --> 01:29:49,824
Re-establishing it is a detail

1976
01:29:50,592 --> 01:29:54,432
The report says that China would be successful in squashing the outbreak in their country by

1977
01:29:54,688 --> 01:29:55,712
Instituting a harsh locked

1978
01:29:56,480 --> 01:29:57,504
This isn't the

1979
01:29:57,760 --> 01:30:01,344
Can the president as much as it is a reflection of what they did in 2002 and 2000

1980
01:30:01,600 --> 01:30:02,624
Free during the summer

1981
01:30:03,648 --> 01:30:04,928
They didn't have to go

1982
01:30:05,696 --> 01:30:08,768
Didn't have to go as far in in the outbreak

1983
01:30:09,024 --> 01:30:11,072
In 2002-2003

1984
01:30:11,328 --> 01:30:12,352
According to Lancet quote

1985
01:30:12,864 --> 01:30:16,704
China best exemplified this large-scale quarantine by declaring epidemic Zone

1986
01:30:16,960 --> 01:30:17,984
Play some people under collector

1987
01:30:18,240 --> 01:30:20,288
To quarantine the villages cities in Institution

1988
01:30:21,056 --> 01:30:22,848
The stringent control measures

1989
01:30:23,104 --> 01:30:26,176
Included school closures and closures of all universities in public places

1990
01:30:26,432 --> 01:30:28,736
As well as the cancellation of a public holiday in May

1991
01:30:29,504 --> 01:30:32,320
In May 2003 China lockdown Beijing

1992
01:30:32,576 --> 01:30:33,344
Enclosed more than

1993
01:30:33,600 --> 01:30:35,648
3500 public places in an effort to

1994
01:30:35,904 --> 01:30:36,928
The curb Community spread

1995
01:30:37,696 --> 01:30:38,976
The reporters using things

1996
01:30:39,232 --> 01:30:40,000
That have happened in the

1997
01:30:40,256 --> 01:30:42,816
The past to give life to the scenarios they're creating

1998
01:30:43,072 --> 01:30:43,840
In order to discuss

1999
01:30:44,352 --> 01:30:46,144
The issues of technological innovation

2000
01:30:46,400 --> 01:30:48,704
And how it relates to the central question of the report

2001
01:30:48,960 --> 01:30:49,984
Which is literally quote

2002
01:30:50,496 --> 01:30:53,312
How might technology affect barriers to building resilience

2003
01:30:53,568 --> 01:30:54,592
An equitable growth in

2004
01:30:54,848 --> 01:30:56,384
In the developing world over the next 50

2005
01:30:56,896 --> 01:30:57,664
20 years

2006
01:30:58,432 --> 01:30:58,944
Clear

2007
01:30:59,712 --> 01:31:02,272
Where you Don Salazar is writing about this report makes

2008
01:31:02,528 --> 01:31:03,552
We think that he has read

2009
01:31:04,320 --> 01:31:06,112
Which means that he's intentionally lying about it

2010
01:31:06,880 --> 01:31:07,648
What are the excerpt

2011
01:31:07,904 --> 01:31:08,416
He uses

2012
01:31:08,672 --> 01:31:10,208
Spin the article really makes me feel

2013
01:31:10,464 --> 01:31:11,232
Confident that he's

2014
01:31:11,488 --> 01:31:12,000
BB's Reddit

2015
01:31:12,256 --> 01:31:13,024
In the article

2016
01:31:13,280 --> 01:31:13,792
He says quote

2017
01:31:14,048 --> 01:31:15,584
Governments have a

2018
01:31:15,840 --> 01:31:16,864
Quoting from the report

2019
01:31:17,120 --> 01:31:19,680
From the report not from his article quoting

2020
01:31:19,936 --> 01:31:24,288
From the varying degrees of success in policing internet traffic

2021
01:31:24,544 --> 01:31:25,312
But those efforts

2022
01:31:25,568 --> 01:31:27,616
Nevertheless fracture the World Wide Web

2023
01:31:27,872 --> 01:31:28,640
The scenario envision

2024
01:31:29,408 --> 01:31:30,432
Here's the full quote

2025
01:31:30,688 --> 01:31:31,200
From the report

2026
01:31:31,712 --> 01:31:33,248
Quote driven by protection

2027
01:31:33,504 --> 01:31:34,528
ISM in National Security

2028
01:31:34,784 --> 01:31:35,296
Concerned

2029
01:31:35,552 --> 01:31:37,600
Created their own independent regionally

2030
01:31:37,856 --> 01:31:39,136
Defined it Network

2031
01:31:39,648 --> 01:31:40,928
Mimicking China's firewall

2032
01:31:41,440 --> 01:31:42,720
Governments are varying degrees

2033
01:31:42,976 --> 01:31:45,792
Discuss in policing internet traffic but those efforts nevertheless

2034
01:31:46,048 --> 01:31:47,584
Fracture the World Wide Web

2035
01:31:48,352 --> 01:31:49,120
In the report this

2036
01:31:49,376 --> 01:31:49,888
Is not a good

2037
01:31:50,656 --> 01:31:51,936
The report is literally about hatch

2038
01:31:52,192 --> 01:31:54,496
How technology can be used to help the developing world

2039
01:31:54,752 --> 01:31:56,032
In this scenario one of the predict

2040
01:31:56,288 --> 01:32:00,128
To technological development is a destruction of the worldwide nature of the web

2041
01:32:00,384 --> 01:32:01,664
Occult countries

2042
01:32:02,176 --> 01:32:03,712
Creating their own isolated and

2043
01:32:03,968 --> 01:32:04,736
Insulated internet

2044
01:32:04,992 --> 01:32:06,272
Which is going to hurt

2045
01:32:06,528 --> 01:32:07,296
Innovation

2046
01:32:07,552 --> 01:32:08,832
Because they're not allowed to share it out

2047
01:32:09,088 --> 01:32:10,880
You got it

2048
01:32:11,136 --> 01:32:13,952
No one who's read this report could possibly read that description

2049
01:32:14,208 --> 01:32:16,000
Attack in this scenario and think

2050
01:32:16,256 --> 01:32:19,328
The authors of the report consider this a desirable out

2051
01:32:19,840 --> 01:32:21,632
Or something that they will be working towards

2052
01:32:21,888 --> 01:32:22,400
You legitimate

2053
01:32:22,656 --> 01:32:23,424
Really have to be lying

2054
01:32:23,680 --> 01:32:24,704
Conclusion

2055
01:32:24,960 --> 01:32:25,984
Which add-on is doing

2056
01:32:26,496 --> 01:32:27,776
And Alex's then repeat

2057
01:32:29,056 --> 01:32:33,408
Don't say Dan they have to release their plan and act like it's

2058
01:32:33,664 --> 01:32:34,176
Not there

2059
01:32:34,432 --> 01:32:37,760
Plan in order to make sure that you know that it's their plan which

2060
01:32:38,016 --> 01:32:38,528
Allows them to

2061
01:32:38,784 --> 01:32:39,296
To carry out the

2062
01:32:39,808 --> 01:32:41,600
Cuz as dark demons

2063
01:32:41,856 --> 01:32:43,136
They have to agree it

2064
01:32:43,648 --> 01:32:44,416
It's like you

2065
01:32:44,672 --> 01:32:49,536
You can't let a vampire in your house unless you invite them in its exact same thing with the globalist

2066
01:32:50,304 --> 01:32:54,912
If you can't enact a global pandemic if you don't first tell people

2067
01:32:55,168 --> 01:32:55,680
That you're going

2068
01:32:56,192 --> 01:33:02,336
I mean I think Alex probably does believe that fly

2069
01:33:02,592 --> 01:33:08,736
Are reaching from this

2070
01:33:08,992 --> 01:33:14,624
People like a dawn Salazar are clearly reading the document in order to cherry-pick these quotes

2071
01:33:14,880 --> 01:33:17,184
So he has to

2072
01:33:17,440 --> 01:33:17,952
Either

2073
01:33:18,208 --> 01:33:19,488
Unable to read

2074
01:33:19,744 --> 01:33:21,536
On a adult level

2075
01:33:22,048 --> 01:33:22,560
Ascertain

2076
01:33:23,072 --> 01:33:23,840
I don't think that's

2077
01:33:24,352 --> 01:33:26,400
But you'd have to be able to not

2078
01:33:26,656 --> 01:33:27,680
Engage with what

2079
01:33:27,936 --> 01:33:30,240
The point of this document is at all right

2080
01:33:30,496 --> 01:33:32,288
Or you have to intentionally be lying about it

2081
01:33:32,544 --> 01:33:33,568
Or both

2082
01:33:33,824 --> 01:33:36,896
But I think probably the latter I think it's all just completely

2083
01:33:37,152 --> 01:33:38,432
Especially when you're bossy

2084
01:33:38,688 --> 01:33:39,200
Is not in

2085
01:33:39,968 --> 01:33:40,480
Things that won't

2086
01:33:40,736 --> 01:33:41,248
Help him

2087
01:33:42,016 --> 01:33:42,528
His narrative

2088
01:33:42,784 --> 01:33:46,368
Easier not he's not going to be like oh read this and write me up something

2089
01:33:46,880 --> 01:33:51,744
And do it with whatever your conclusions are he's starting from a place of like

2090
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:54,304
I need this to be an evil AI.

2091
01:33:54,560 --> 01:33:56,096
Can you cover this response for me

2092
01:33:56,352 --> 01:33:59,936
Can you do a good job on this one like where they don't

2093
01:34:00,192 --> 01:34:03,264
Don't go off the reservation and get to get real

2094
01:34:03,520 --> 01:34:04,032
Who are you

2095
01:34:04,288 --> 01:34:09,408
Who are you what did you do with Alex want you to go by the Buckeye

2096
01:34:11,712 --> 01:34:17,344
Alright if you need help call someone at the Washington Post okay never taking a journalism class before in your

2097
01:34:17,600 --> 01:34:21,184
Your life but this time this time again you got to step it up

2098
01:34:21,696 --> 01:34:22,208
Ridiculous

2099
01:34:22,464 --> 01:34:26,048
Bananas anyway Alex gets into talking about how Trump is real

2100
01:34:26,304 --> 01:34:27,328
MMS gets real weird

2101
01:34:30,400 --> 01:34:32,960
Why do you think they're so damn scared

2102
01:34:33,984 --> 01:34:34,752
Cuz he's insane

2103
01:34:37,056 --> 01:34:38,080
What does real

2104
01:34:38,592 --> 01:34:39,360
Rose's real

2105
01:34:39,616 --> 01:34:40,128
What

2106
01:34:47,552 --> 01:34:49,088
He really calls the shots

2107
01:34:49,856 --> 01:34:51,904
You know how past the Bob Lazar

2108
01:34:52,672 --> 01:34:54,720
That there's a dude in there that isn't

2109
01:34:54,976 --> 01:34:56,000
Out to get America

2110
01:34:58,048 --> 01:34:58,560
What

2111
01:34:59,072 --> 01:35:00,096
Russian

2112
01:35:00,608 --> 01:35:01,120
What happened

2113
01:35:01,376 --> 01:35:01,888
Russia

2114
01:35:05,216 --> 01:35:06,240
The globalist

2115
01:35:06,752 --> 01:35:12,896
That is as I was nowhere as itsy was like real life field

2116
01:35:13,152 --> 01:35:15,968
Do we have to give it up to the Somali pirates what has happened

2117
01:35:16,224 --> 01:35:19,296
It's not uncommon for Alex just a heap Praise on food

2118
01:35:19,552 --> 01:35:21,856
Get like it's a

2119
01:35:22,112 --> 01:35:24,928
Sing for me

2120
01:35:25,184 --> 01:35:25,952
For a while

2121
01:35:26,208 --> 01:35:27,232
That would still like

2122
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:28,512
What

2123
01:35:28,768 --> 01:35:30,304
What are you doing what's going on what's the

2124
01:35:31,072 --> 01:35:37,216
Anyway I don't think Kohl's Trump calls the shots then he has to take responsibility.

2125
01:35:37,472 --> 01:35:39,520
Don't worry about it

2126
01:35:39,776 --> 01:35:44,896
Yeah but you can only call shots when Global start lying to you

2127
01:35:46,688 --> 01:35:47,200
Stop

2128
01:35:48,736 --> 01:35:49,248
Fair enough

2129
01:35:51,552 --> 01:35:54,368
I don't like being a real

2130
01:35:55,392 --> 01:35:56,416
Black widows are real

2131
01:35:57,440 --> 01:35:59,488
Rattlesnakes

2132
01:35:59,744 --> 01:36:02,304
So you're saying the Trump might kill us

2133
01:36:02,560 --> 01:36:04,864
Yes there are

2134
01:36:07,680 --> 01:36:10,240
I don't know I guess I would rather us like a

2135
01:36:10,496 --> 01:36:14,336
Slick fake politician who's good at policy and like

2136
01:36:14,592 --> 01:36:16,128
Means well then

2137
01:36:16,384 --> 01:36:18,432
A guy who 50 he's real but

2138
01:36:18,688 --> 01:36:21,248
50/50 chance he will kill all of us

2139
01:36:21,504 --> 01:36:23,552
And even with a rose you know like hey

2140
01:36:24,064 --> 01:36:29,696
Thorns will cut you but also it's beautiful on top there's a certain metaphor I don't crave authenticity

2141
01:36:29,952 --> 01:36:32,256
That badly

2142
01:36:33,280 --> 01:36:33,792
Okay

2143
01:36:36,096 --> 01:36:38,144
Guaranteed income and universal healthcare

2144
01:36:38,656 --> 01:36:39,168
But this guy

2145
01:36:39,680 --> 01:36:40,192
This guy

2146
01:36:40,960 --> 01:36:42,496
Bacon

2147
01:36:42,752 --> 01:36:46,848
Tends to like various things he doesn't really

2148
01:36:47,104 --> 01:36:47,872
Codon table

2149
01:36:48,128 --> 01:36:49,408
He said he was in the room

2150
01:36:49,664 --> 01:36:50,944
Radiohead showing that

2151
01:36:51,456 --> 01:36:57,344
Not true I was on the bandwagon with Radiohead before he was he's a faker

2152
01:36:57,600 --> 01:37:00,160
I mean authenticity in Friends

2153
01:37:00,416 --> 01:37:02,208
Bike Associates

2154
01:37:03,232 --> 01:37:05,024
I mean even maybe like artists

2155
01:37:05,280 --> 01:37:07,072
Do you like that is probably

2156
01:37:07,584 --> 01:37:08,352
Conversation

2157
01:37:08,608 --> 01:37:09,120
It's worth having

2158
01:37:09,376 --> 01:37:10,400
I'm not sure

2159
01:37:10,656 --> 01:37:11,168
It's the

2160
01:37:11,936 --> 01:37:14,752
It's not my top thing in a politician

2161
01:37:15,008 --> 01:37:18,592
When you when you say you know I don't want a full online

2162
01:37:20,640 --> 01:37:21,920
Well it's like the

2163
01:37:22,176 --> 01:37:24,992
When you're like oh man you know I got to be honest I like

2164
01:37:25,248 --> 01:37:26,528
This guy cuz I know where he's staying

2165
01:37:27,040 --> 01:37:27,552
You know

2166
01:37:28,064 --> 01:37:29,344
That is also a

2167
01:37:29,600 --> 01:37:30,880
I don't like this guy

2168
01:37:31,136 --> 01:37:31,904
Because I know where he

2169
01:37:32,928 --> 01:37:37,792
Just because I know where you stand doesn't mean that I don't want you to run as far away from me as you possibly can

2170
01:37:38,048 --> 01:37:38,560
Very strange

2171
01:37:39,072 --> 01:37:40,864
Disgusting so Alex is a philosophy

2172
01:37:41,376 --> 01:37:42,144
3 explained

2173
01:37:42,400 --> 01:37:43,168
In this next clip

2174
01:37:43,936 --> 01:37:44,704
That's very weird

2175
01:37:45,216 --> 01:37:46,240
Hollywood

2176
01:37:46,496 --> 01:37:47,264
Hate you

2177
01:37:47,520 --> 01:37:48,032
The left

2178
01:37:49,568 --> 01:37:51,104
The globalist want to dominate

2179
01:37:52,128 --> 01:37:52,896
They are psychic

2180
01:37:57,760 --> 01:37:59,552
Stan

2181
01:37:59,808 --> 01:38:02,880
Philosophy philosophy

2182
01:38:12,352 --> 01:38:13,632
The family I said knock it off

2183
01:38:14,400 --> 01:38:15,168
I am blessed

2184
01:38:16,192 --> 01:38:17,984
I want to listen to keep us in the fight

2185
01:38:18,496 --> 01:38:19,776
So it's I need your mind

2186
01:38:20,032 --> 01:38:22,080
I have a philosophy and it's simple

2187
01:38:22,592 --> 01:38:25,152
Whatever it is they're doing is bad and I want your money

2188
01:38:25,408 --> 01:38:31,552
Yeah

2189
01:38:31,808 --> 01:38:32,832
People go get it

2190
01:38:33,088 --> 01:38:38,976
And then he said somebody says all the f****** time because

2191
01:38:40,256 --> 01:38:46,400
That's not some kind of weird Vision plays close to the back

2192
01:38:46,656 --> 01:38:47,680
Philosophy

2193
01:38:48,192 --> 01:38:50,752
Alex starts freaking out about the devil

2194
01:38:53,568 --> 01:38:56,896
The more you do it the stronger you get in the more High

2195
01:38:57,152 --> 01:38:59,712
On the fight you get in a good way of love

2196
01:39:07,904 --> 01:39:10,976
Challenger X the power they could ever imagine but with

2197
01:39:13,536 --> 01:39:16,608
And then you realize he's nothing but a reflection of the creator

2198
01:39:16,864 --> 01:39:20,704
And then you feel the awesome presence of God and then the power doesn't matter anymore

2199
01:39:21,216 --> 01:39:22,752
You're on your knees

2200
01:39:27,872 --> 01:39:29,408
To be ready to fight

2201
01:39:34,784 --> 01:39:37,344
By those of us

2202
01:39:38,880 --> 01:39:41,440
You will be thrown against Satan and broken

2203
01:39:41,952 --> 01:39:44,256
God

2204
01:39:46,560 --> 01:39:47,584
Well you had long

2205
01:39:47,840 --> 01:39:48,864
The States Army

2206
01:39:55,776 --> 01:39:57,824
God helps me politically takeout

2207
01:39:58,080 --> 01:40:00,128
A million or two million of the globular

2208
01:40:00,640 --> 01:40:02,688
The number to

2209
01:40:03,456 --> 01:40:05,760
Eyeballs gouged

2210
01:40:08,576 --> 01:40:10,368
I'll buy a giant black spider

2211
01:40:15,744 --> 01:40:18,560
All I found was Victory on the other side

2212
01:40:20,096 --> 01:40:21,888
I don't think you made it to the other side buddy

2213
01:40:22,656 --> 01:40:23,424
Anime

2214
01:40:23,936 --> 01:40:27,008
All the temporal attacks against me

2215
01:40:27,520 --> 01:40:29,312
And in the name of Jesus

2216
01:40:30,592 --> 01:40:31,360
Dudley depart

2217
01:40:31,616 --> 01:40:33,152
Vanquishing this week

2218
01:40:38,016 --> 01:40:38,528
You have

2219
01:40:56,448 --> 01:40:57,216
The sword

2220
01:41:02,848 --> 01:41:03,872
Bring down the enemy

2221
01:41:04,128 --> 01:41:10,272
That pauses Nestor a better sort out of that that was like really all that interesting

2222
01:41:10,528 --> 01:41:14,112
And there's not a whole lot to even discuss about that but I wanted to play that to like

2223
01:41:14,368 --> 01:41:15,136
I hope the audience

2224
01:41:15,392 --> 01:41:16,160
Spheal

2225
01:41:16,672 --> 01:41:21,536
This episode has minutes more of that

2226
01:41:21,792 --> 01:41:24,608
Really weirdly

2227
01:41:24,864 --> 01:41:25,888
Just like

2228
01:41:26,400 --> 01:41:31,008
I have been thrown into the depths of evil

2229
01:41:31,264 --> 01:41:33,824
Thank you listen to my television last episode

2230
01:41:35,104 --> 01:41:37,152
You got the wrong lesson but I like

2231
01:41:37,408 --> 01:41:43,552
Also when he says he's been attacked in the real world and also spiritual world and all the spiritual thing

2232
01:41:43,808 --> 01:41:49,952
Things go away in the name of Jesus

2233
01:41:50,208 --> 01:41:53,280
Spiritual marriage to spiritual victory

2234
01:41:53,536 --> 01:41:55,840
Not going to be great victories are going to

2235
01:41:56,608 --> 01:42:00,704
So Alex will eventually be sucked dry by a giant spider

2236
01:42:00,960 --> 01:42:01,472
I think

2237
01:42:01,984 --> 01:42:03,520
Your cute family is probably good

2238
01:42:03,776 --> 01:42:09,920
His kids aren't going to school or homeschool there if they go to public school I've heard him say both in the past

2239
01:42:10,176 --> 01:42:10,688
Real situation is

2240
01:42:10,944 --> 01:42:14,016
But maybe the families around the house maybe they watch the Wild Wild West

2241
01:42:14,272 --> 01:42:16,320
Obsessed with a big giant spider thing

2242
01:42:16,576 --> 01:42:17,344
But

2243
01:42:17,600 --> 01:42:21,440
Spiders going to suck him dry and apparently all of his enemies

2244
01:42:21,696 --> 01:42:24,256
Sure they have already been sucked dry by the spider

2245
01:42:24,512 --> 01:42:29,376
There's a spider on the loose

2246
01:42:29,888 --> 01:42:36,032
Spider

2247
01:42:36,288 --> 01:42:39,360
Now they have no dramatic Enderman realize we shouldn't hate

2248
01:42:40,128 --> 01:42:42,176
Those are like little bugs in a

2249
01:42:42,432 --> 01:42:44,224
Spider's web that are just hot

2250
01:42:45,504 --> 01:42:47,040
The dad they were already sucked out

2251
01:42:47,296 --> 01:42:48,064
They're already gone

2252
01:42:49,088 --> 01:42:50,880
Spiders belly now forever

2253
01:42:52,928 --> 01:42:54,976
Play the spider with their mother was there to give the milk

2254
01:43:01,632 --> 01:43:02,656
Only ever was

2255
01:43:03,680 --> 01:43:04,704
Another slave

2256
01:43:05,216 --> 01:43:06,496
Taken away from God's light

2257
01:43:08,032 --> 01:43:09,824
Freewell like a child

2258
01:43:10,080 --> 01:43:12,128
Tricked out backyard again

2259
01:43:13,920 --> 01:43:14,944
3 taken away

2260
01:43:15,200 --> 01:43:15,712
Forever

2261
01:43:16,992 --> 01:43:17,504
Into the spider

2262
01:43:18,272 --> 01:43:20,832
Gather Souls Berlin forever good movie

2263
01:43:21,600 --> 01:43:22,624
Oblivion

2264
01:43:25,952 --> 01:43:28,000
Are we going to break, stop pontificating

2265
01:43:29,536 --> 01:43:31,072
Your phone calls with comeback in 2 minutes

2266
01:43:32,608 --> 01:43:35,424
I just so much more

2267
01:43:42,592 --> 01:43:44,128
Logan's Run

2268
01:43:44,384 --> 01:43:45,920
10 years ago Rockefeller Foundation

2269
01:43:48,224 --> 01:43:53,088
Stop on infowars.com so this is Sam Rockefeller report

2270
01:43:53,344 --> 01:43:55,136
And it really raises the question

2271
01:43:55,392 --> 01:43:56,160
Question of

2272
01:43:57,184 --> 01:44:00,256
Why are you just talking about this now

2273
01:44:01,024 --> 01:44:05,632
I mean if you've been talkin about the idea that the globalists you know

2274
01:44:05,888 --> 01:44:08,192
Did they going to attack everybody and blah blah blah

2275
01:44:08,704 --> 01:44:11,264
All this to bring it a marshall or whatever right

2276
01:44:11,520 --> 01:44:17,664
But he's not even talk about this specific document they were 10 years behind and it turns out they're not 10 years

2277
01:44:17,920 --> 01:44:22,272
Very obsessed with this document that's been around awhile

2278
01:44:22,528 --> 01:44:23,552
I think maybe

2279
01:44:23,808 --> 01:44:26,624
I found about it by reading Jim Fetters blog

2280
01:44:27,136 --> 01:44:28,928
Anyway it it's just like

2281
01:44:29,952 --> 01:44:31,232
This is sloppy ant-like

2282
01:44:31,488 --> 01:44:32,256
Even if

2283
01:44:32,768 --> 01:44:37,632
He been talking about this forever even even talked about this specific reference the source

2284
01:44:38,144 --> 01:44:38,912
Forever

2285
01:44:39,168 --> 01:44:39,936
It doesn't

2286
01:44:40,192 --> 01:44:41,472
Approve what do you saying it does

2287
01:44:43,520 --> 01:44:44,032
Sad

2288
01:44:46,336 --> 01:44:47,616
This is the most research

2289
01:44:48,128 --> 01:44:48,640
Show

2290
01:44:51,712 --> 01:44:53,760
The f****** spider

2291
01:44:55,296 --> 01:44:57,600
The thing that I despise about his theology

2292
01:44:57,856 --> 01:44:59,392
She is that he's always so up

2293
01:44:59,648 --> 01:45:01,184
Obsessed with physical appearance

2294
01:45:01,440 --> 01:45:03,232
But demons are always fizz

2295
01:45:03,488 --> 01:45:04,000
Physically ugly

2296
01:45:04,512 --> 01:45:05,024
Weather

2297
01:45:05,536 --> 01:45:06,304
Literally

2298
01:45:07,840 --> 01:45:09,376
It's just so much as like

2299
01:45:09,632 --> 01:45:12,192
You're going to be tempted by beautiful things

2300
01:45:12,704 --> 01:45:15,776
Well yeah they're the ones that are scary that theme does

2301
01:45:16,032 --> 01:45:17,312
Play out a lot of voltec

2302
01:45:18,592 --> 01:45:19,104
Cover big deal

2303
01:45:20,128 --> 01:45:21,664
So Alex hasn't read this

2304
01:45:21,920 --> 01:45:23,200
Rockefeller report uncertain

2305
01:45:23,712 --> 01:45:28,064
And the way he discusses some of the details like he's reading off

2306
01:45:28,320 --> 01:45:31,392
A little bit like it's so clear that he is unfamiliar with

2307
01:45:32,416 --> 01:45:33,184
Call Mocksville

2308
01:45:36,512 --> 01:45:38,560
Spider top-down government control

2309
01:45:38,816 --> 01:45:40,352
And more authoritarian leadership

2310
01:45:40,864 --> 01:45:41,376
Limited

2311
01:45:42,144 --> 01:45:43,168
Innovation and Rowing

2312
01:45:43,936 --> 01:45:44,704
Citizen pushback

2313
01:45:52,128 --> 01:45:57,248
That's a big towel to me that all Alex is done is scam dad on Salazar's article

2314
01:45:57,504 --> 01:46:03,648
Because if he'd read the actual report he would know that limited technological innovation and growing citizen pushback examples

2315
01:46:03,904 --> 01:46:05,184
Elements of the lockstep

2316
01:46:05,440 --> 01:46:05,952
Scenario

2317
01:46:06,208 --> 01:46:07,232
That they do not want

2318
01:46:09,536 --> 01:46:10,816
Make philanthropic work

2319
01:46:11,072 --> 01:46:11,584
Enveloping

2320
01:46:11,840 --> 01:46:12,608
World

2321
01:46:12,864 --> 01:46:13,376
Right

2322
01:46:13,632 --> 01:46:14,400
More difficult

2323
01:46:14,656 --> 01:46:16,192
It would be a situation where you wouldn't

2324
01:46:16,448 --> 01:46:16,960
Be able

2325
01:46:17,216 --> 01:46:17,728
To help

2326
01:46:17,984 --> 01:46:20,032
People in a way that is your mission

2327
01:46:22,080 --> 01:46:26,944
Help people in his estimate destroy the world

2328
01:46:27,200 --> 01:46:31,296
It makes a certain sense for him to believe that lockstep is their plan because they want

2329
01:46:31,808 --> 01:46:32,576
All of that

2330
01:46:33,088 --> 01:46:34,624
It's stupid

2331
01:46:35,136 --> 01:46:39,488
Actually helps Alex to have not read it because then he doesn't have to answer that question

2332
01:46:40,512 --> 01:46:45,120
Can you be very difficult that would be a hard one imagine how Alex would as a joke

2333
01:46:45,376 --> 01:46:49,216
But I've difficult time would be apart of it

2334
01:46:49,984 --> 01:46:51,264
So Alex gets back from break

2335
01:46:51,776 --> 01:46:52,288
Abl complain

2336
01:46:53,824 --> 01:46:55,360
Some calls I'm not entirely sure if this was in a

2337
01:46:55,616 --> 01:46:57,152
Call but I

2338
01:46:57,408 --> 01:46:58,688
Complaints about what's going on

2339
01:46:59,200 --> 01:47:04,064
No doubt the globalist banks

2340
01:47:04,576 --> 01:47:05,856
The globalist banks

2341
01:47:06,368 --> 01:47:08,928
Rationalizing

2342
01:47:11,232 --> 01:47:17,376
So Alex is mad about global as Banks trying to nationalize companies in the midst of a crisis I have some bad news about what is Buddy

2343
01:47:17,632 --> 01:47:21,984
Trump said the Associated Press reported on March 19th about

2344
01:47:22,240 --> 01:47:26,336
Trump press conference where is discussing the bailouts for Industries like hotels and Airlines

2345
01:47:26,848 --> 01:47:27,872
Asked if his

2346
01:47:28,128 --> 01:47:30,688
If you supported the federal government moving to take in

2347
01:47:30,944 --> 01:47:32,480
An equity stake in some companies

2348
01:47:32,736 --> 01:47:35,296
Trump said quote I do I really do

2349
01:47:35,808 --> 01:47:40,416
Also in that article that discuss how it tourney General Bill Barr had commented that the US should

2350
01:47:40,672 --> 01:47:43,488
Consider taking a controlling stake in Nokia or Ericsson

2351
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:46,304
To be able to compete with China's Huawei

2352
01:47:47,072 --> 01:47:53,216
I'm not really sure I necessarily opposed so nationalization of Industries but Alex definitely should be against

2353
01:47:53,728 --> 01:47:54,752
Yeah you think he was

2354
01:47:55,008 --> 01:47:59,872
Furious went by the Obama government took a stake in General Motors after bailing out the Auto industry

2355
01:48:00,128 --> 01:48:01,408
So I've no idea why you

2356
01:48:01,664 --> 01:48:04,480
Just as upset about Trump indicating that he wants to do the same thing

2357
01:48:04,992 --> 01:48:05,504
Except I do

2358
01:48:06,272 --> 01:48:08,064
Is because Alex is a principal list hack

2359
01:48:08,576 --> 01:48:09,600
His hero does all the thing

2360
01:48:09,856 --> 01:48:10,624
Things he says the villains

2361
01:48:10,880 --> 01:48:11,904
Do in order to continue

2362
01:48:12,160 --> 01:48:14,720
Pretending is racist ass idiot hero is a gyro

2363
01:48:14,976 --> 01:48:16,512
You just pretend someone else is doing it

2364
01:48:17,024 --> 01:48:23,168
Trump says he wants the government to take a controlling stake in Airlines Alex reported as Global everything

2365
01:48:23,424 --> 01:48:26,240
Very simple it's not hard

2366
01:48:26,496 --> 01:48:27,520
You just

2367
01:48:27,776 --> 01:48:32,128
It's like you goddamn dumb on all the stuff that he hates

2368
01:48:32,640 --> 01:48:33,920

This is a whistle-blower

2437
01:52:23,808 --> 01:52:25,088
You're also a

2438
01:52:26,368 --> 01:52:28,416
If you listen to his story

2439
01:52:28,928 --> 01:52:30,208
It's an option

2440
01:52:30,976 --> 01:52:33,024
Mail-in ballot

2441
01:52:33,280 --> 01:52:35,072
Whistleblower

2442
01:52:36,096 --> 01:52:36,864
That's insane

2443
01:52:37,632 --> 01:52:38,912
I heard that is like

2444
01:52:39,680 --> 01:52:40,192
What's

2445
01:52:40,448 --> 01:52:43,264
What were you ready for you just wasn't ready for it

2446
01:52:43,520 --> 01:52:46,336
Male involving he wasn't ready for what

2447
01:52:46,592 --> 01:52:49,408
Is the story wait until there's an election day holiday

2448
01:52:49,664 --> 01:52:52,992
Man can you imagine how unready this guy's going to be for that

2449
01:52:53,248 --> 01:52:58,112
Can be real bad so Alex are you saying I don't have to work and I can vote

2450
01:52:58,368 --> 01:52:59,648
Go to break

2451
01:52:59,904 --> 01:53:02,720
So they get cut off and when he comes back from break

2452
01:53:03,232 --> 01:53:04,512
He is now learned

2453
01:53:04,768 --> 01:53:06,816
That he's been kicked off the Android

2454
01:53:07,072 --> 01:53:11,680
App store and it turns out that that is breaking

2455
01:53:11,936 --> 01:53:12,960
In the middle of the show

2456
01:53:13,216 --> 01:53:14,240
But because of that

2457
01:53:14,496 --> 01:53:18,592
He now has to pretend that that stuff earlier wasn't in response to

2458
01:53:18,848 --> 01:53:20,128
Him losing its appeal

2459
01:53:20,384 --> 01:53:24,224
You have to sort of pretend that this update his narrative mint

2460
01:53:24,480 --> 01:53:28,832
It's more like he now has that awareness of the obvious

2461
01:53:29,088 --> 01:53:31,904
Responding to it early to bring it up now

2462
01:53:32,160 --> 01:53:33,696
Because he's going to eat CertaPro

2463
01:53:33,952 --> 01:53:37,024
Pretending that they're all piling on a shirt in the middle of his show

2464
01:53:37,280 --> 01:53:43,424
You want to talk about Twilight Zone

2465
01:53:43,680 --> 01:53:49,824

2467
01:53:52,640 --> 01:53:54,944

2468
01:53:55,456 --> 01:53:57,248
If I were there kangaroos quartz injuries

2469
01:53:59,296 --> 01:54:02,112
Not that it's always

2470
01:54:02,368 --> 01:54:04,672
Lawsuit

2471
01:54:04,928 --> 01:54:09,792

2472
01:54:10,304 --> 01:54:12,352

01:54:14,144 --> 01:54:14,656
Nope

2475
01:54:15,168 --> 01:54:16,448
I'm a loser not a winner

2476
01:54:16,704 --> 01:54:17,728
That's the truth

2477
01:54:17,984 --> 01:54:24,128
So now he's able to respond to this a little bit because there's another story and I was pretty mad

2478
01:54:24,896 --> 01:54:26,176
And so

2479
01:54:26,688 --> 01:54:29,504

Man

2502
01:55:49,632 --> 01:55:51,936
That is so

2503
01:55:52,192 --> 01:55:53,216
And the article is just

2504
01:55:53,728 --> 01:55:54,240
As a little

2505
01:55:54,496 --> 01:55:55,008
Anthony's presenting

2506
01:55:55,520 --> 01:56:00,128
In fairness it does discuss his weird alien / devil beliefs thing

2507
01:56:00,384 --> 01:56:06,528
In the video in question Jones says that quote everybody dies under the new world order except maybe one-tenth of one percent that believe

2508
01:56:06,784 --> 01:56:07,552
Leave it there going to merge

2509
01:56:07,808 --> 01:56:12,160
Machines that deals with this interdimensional thing that gave them all the technology

2510
01:56:12,416 --> 01:56:17,024
You can't make a deal with these aliens okay that the Bible tells you about and you can get off

2511
01:56:17,280 --> 01:56:17,792
Planet

2512
01:56:18,560 --> 01:56:20,864
Alex wants to put down his concrete

2513
01:56:21,376 --> 01:56:24,704
It is a religious belief is that there's evil aliens that serve an interdimensional thing

2514
01:56:24,960 --> 01:56:31,104
The giveaway technology

2515
01:56:31,360 --> 01:56:32,384
Either way

2516
01:56:32,640 --> 01:56:35,200
The very next sentence in the article is quote

2517
01:56:35,456 --> 01:56:41,600
Elsewhere in the video Jones claims that natural antivirals exist 232 novel Coronavirus

2518
01:56:41,856 --> 01:56:44,672
The one that they're interested in buddy

2519
01:56:44,928 --> 01:56:49,024
Where the headline is about hubby coronavirus misinformation was what caused the band

2520
01:56:49,280 --> 01:56:52,096
That's really important part of the article which is why Alex

2521
01:56:52,352 --> 01:56:53,376
Pretend skier that it doesn't

2522
01:56:53,632 --> 01:56:58,496
Exist about being afraid of demon aliens is really just in that article to make fun of Alan

2523
01:56:59,008 --> 01:57:01,312
But again I have to say this is great play for Alex

2524
01:57:01,824 --> 01:57:04,384
It's completely baseless and he's just making stuff up but it's

2525
01:57:04,640 --> 01:57:07,712
Almost certainly believe that he's being persecuted for his deeply Christian

2526
01:57:07,968 --> 01:57:09,248
Believe in aliens

2527
01:57:09,504 --> 01:57:10,016
Give you technology

2528
01:57:10,784 --> 01:57:12,832
Also Alex is have never went to number one on iTunes

2529
01:57:14,624 --> 01:57:15,392
Briefly

2530
01:57:15,904 --> 01:57:17,952
So that this isn't going to work

2531
01:57:18,464 --> 01:57:21,280
Because I was accidentally read the rest of the article

2532
01:57:21,792 --> 01:57:25,888
Why did he do that doesn't read the whole thing at this point eventually

2533
01:57:26,144 --> 01:57:27,680
Realizes that's not

2534
01:57:27,936 --> 01:57:28,448
What they're saying

2535
01:57:28,704 --> 01:57:33,056
What is a really good initial thing and he probably should have stuck with it

2536
01:57:33,312 --> 01:57:36,384
Why would you do that no that was it was a mistake. Your deflection

2537
01:57:36,640 --> 01:57:42,272
So he eventually is like they're just mad cuz I said quinine in tonic

2538
01:57:42,528 --> 01:57:43,552
Good for you like okay

2539
01:57:45,344 --> 01:57:46,112
Much worse

2540
01:57:46,368 --> 01:57:47,904
It's boring as lame

2541
01:57:49,952 --> 01:57:50,976
My My Religion

2542
01:57:51,232 --> 01:57:53,280
Right to believe in aliens

2543
01:57:54,304 --> 01:57:55,840
Video suppressant before

2544
01:57:56,096 --> 01:58:00,192
The stuff that's the better one cut around all kinds of logical thinking

2545
01:58:00,448 --> 01:58:05,824
You get that in front of religious people and they'll be like I can't think any active no rationality

2546
01:58:06,080 --> 01:58:07,360
So Alex

2547
01:58:07,616 --> 01:58:09,664
Before he accidentally read the rest of this

2548
01:58:09,920 --> 01:58:11,968
Peace

2549
01:58:12,224 --> 01:58:14,784
Touches back on the Sandy Hook sanctions

2550
01:58:15,040 --> 01:58:15,808
Situation

2551
01:58:17,600 --> 01:58:21,184
Appeal-Democrat

2552
01:58:22,720 --> 01:58:24,000
Best friends

2553
01:58:30,656 --> 01:58:31,168
Whitney Vann

2554
01:58:35,776 --> 01:58:37,312
Some legal fees or something

2555
01:58:38,336 --> 01:58:41,152
They just recycle that story again and go Jones

2556
01:58:48,832 --> 01:58:51,904
Pappyland

2557
01:58:52,160 --> 01:58:52,672
Andalusia

2558
01:58:52,928 --> 01:58:53,952
You're the one

2559
01:59:02,400 --> 01:59:02,912
The

2560
01:59:03,936 --> 01:59:05,472
Popular five-star rated

2561
01:59:06,752 --> 01:59:07,264
Call Wars

2562
01:59:11,360 --> 01:59:12,128
That wasn't in the article

2563
01:59:13,408 --> 01:59:14,176
And then you read

2564
01:59:15,200 --> 01:59:16,224
Material

2565
01:59:22,112 --> 01:59:23,136
And it says

2566
01:59:25,184 --> 01:59:27,488
Because Jones

2567
01:59:28,768 --> 01:59:32,608
Deal with extraterrestrials

2568
01:59:32,864 --> 01:59:35,680
The Shadow Children take out Humanity

2569
01:59:38,496 --> 01:59:39,776
Somebody for that

2570
01:59:40,032 --> 01:59:40,544
Cuz you did

2571
01:59:40,800 --> 01:59:43,872
But it's still at still what he's presenting at

2572
01:59:46,176 --> 01:59:46,944
But he even

2573
01:59:47,200 --> 01:59:47,968
Has to realize it

2574
01:59:48,224 --> 01:59:51,296
It's too much b******* and

2575
01:59:51,552 --> 01:59:52,576
Which is which sucks

2576
01:59:52,832 --> 01:59:54,624
I want the Alex that I actually like

2577
01:59:54,880 --> 01:59:55,392
F*** it

2578
01:59:55,648 --> 02:00:01,024
I said it taken with it yet but like I said he accidentally starts reading the article and it's like

2579
02:00:01,280 --> 02:00:04,352
Yeah I could deal with these aliens

2580
02:00:05,120 --> 02:00:06,912
Let the Bible tells you about

2581
02:00:08,192 --> 02:00:08,704
Call the planet

2582
02:00:09,728 --> 02:00:10,752
Stop

2583
02:00:18,944 --> 02:00:19,712
And deflated

2584
02:00:21,248 --> 02:00:22,784
Bump bump bump

2585
02:00:23,552 --> 02:00:24,064
Yelling

2586
02:00:25,600 --> 02:00:27,648
7 C

2587
02:00:27,904 --> 02:00:28,416
What

2588
02:00:32,512 --> 02:00:33,024
Zinc

2589
02:00:33,280 --> 02:00:34,560
Now you're defensive

2590
02:00:34,816 --> 02:00:35,584
You lose sap

2591
02:00:43,520 --> 02:00:44,032
All the tonic

2592
02:00:44,288 --> 02:00:46,080
Is so boring now

2593
02:00:47,104 --> 02:00:53,248
Beginning really defensive about how his religion is based on alien demons and they give away technology people

2594
02:00:53,504 --> 02:00:54,272
Will take DMT to

2595
02:00:54,528 --> 02:00:55,552
To commune with the demons like

2596
02:00:56,320 --> 02:00:59,904
If you wanted to really go hard in that lane go in but that's

2597
02:01:00,160 --> 02:01:06,304
Good alternative f****** Project Camelot in no time

2598
02:01:06,560 --> 02:01:07,072
But

2599
02:01:07,328 --> 02:01:09,888
Now you're retreating back to these Waters of like

2600
02:01:10,144 --> 02:01:11,936
Quinine is actually good

2601
02:01:12,448 --> 02:01:16,544
I like Thomas it's so boring and standard and it gets into like

2602
02:01:18,080 --> 02:01:19,104
General

2603
02:01:19,360 --> 02:01:20,128
As a whole

2604
02:01:20,384 --> 02:01:20,896
Not interested

2605
02:01:21,408 --> 02:01:22,432
Though there is one

2606
02:01:22,688 --> 02:01:24,992
Angle that Alex takes that I think is pretty good

2607
02:01:25,248 --> 02:01:26,016
And that is

2608
02:01:26,272 --> 02:01:27,296
All these people

2609
02:01:27,808 --> 02:01:29,856
Out there that are trying to tell you

2610
02:01:30,112 --> 02:01:31,392
Chloroquine

2611
02:01:31,648 --> 02:01:33,696
Is not the miracle cure

2612
02:01:33,952 --> 02:01:35,488
Extinguisher hope

2613
02:01:35,744 --> 02:01:41,376
It's a really interesting angle

2614
02:01:46,240 --> 02:01:47,008
Say

2615
02:01:54,432 --> 02:01:54,944
Prescribed

2616
02:01:55,712 --> 02:01:56,736
Hydroxy

2617
02:01:58,784 --> 02:02:00,576
Because they don't want you to have help the Democrats

2618
02:02:01,088 --> 02:02:03,136
Okay don't want it now

2619
02:02:03,904 --> 02:02:04,672
It's not going to help in

2620
02:02:06,720 --> 02:02:08,000
There's a chance

2621
02:02:08,256 --> 02:02:14,144
Could approve the medication

2622
02:02:14,656 --> 02:02:17,984
And people here because of

2623
02:02:18,496 --> 02:02:24,640
Blind baseless hope Juris hope perhaps white lights

2624
02:02:24,896 --> 02:02:26,176
It's not Democrats Mike dewine

2625
02:02:26,432 --> 02:02:30,528
The Republican grow up

2626
02:02:30,784 --> 02:02:32,576
Secret Democrat damn sure Alex

2627
02:02:32,832 --> 02:02:36,928
Would say that I specifically want to do

2628
02:02:37,184 --> 02:02:43,328
Are my enemies so this is how Alex responses news of the Android thing anti Keats

2629
02:02:43,584 --> 02:02:45,888
Promising with the religious freedom angle

2630
02:02:46,144 --> 02:02:46,912
How many Justice

2631
02:02:47,168 --> 02:02:48,192
Layton's boring

2632
02:02:48,448 --> 02:02:51,520
You can feel him deflate to me a little bit

2633
02:02:51,776 --> 02:02:52,800
He went

2634
02:02:54,336 --> 02:02:58,176
And it's so clear that like you hadn't read it before he did on air

2635
02:02:58,688 --> 02:03:00,992
God just do better he's not confident reader

2636
02:03:02,016 --> 02:03:02,528
Certainly not

2637
02:03:02,784 --> 02:03:04,320
Nor do I have confidence in his reading

2638
02:03:04,832 --> 02:03:05,600
So he Rambles

2639
02:03:05,856 --> 02:03:08,160
The bed about this sort of around the same themes like

2640
02:03:08,416 --> 02:03:12,256
Fake stories about my my sanctions ranked

2641
02:03:12,512 --> 02:03:13,792
I like quinine

2642
02:03:14,304 --> 02:03:15,072
I don't sell it

2643
02:03:15,584 --> 02:03:16,096
Who cares

2644
02:03:16,864 --> 02:03:18,144
Bow is a long ramble

2645
02:03:19,424 --> 02:03:23,776
There was a guy on hold holy s*** I did forget

2646
02:03:26,592 --> 02:03:29,152
I'm going to keep this in my mind

2647
02:03:29,408 --> 02:03:31,968
There's a guy on hold

2648
02:03:35,040 --> 02:03:36,320
Literally

2649
02:03:36,576 --> 02:03:37,600
I hate you

2650
02:03:37,856 --> 02:03:39,904
So Dave

2651
02:03:40,160 --> 02:03:40,928
Still on hold

2652
02:03:41,696 --> 02:03:43,744
And I will get back to you

2653
02:03:48,352 --> 02:03:52,448
WWII vet father he gets this thing and something

2654
02:04:00,896 --> 02:04:02,944
Yeah

2655
02:04:03,712 --> 02:04:05,248
This is an envelope

2656
02:04:05,504 --> 02:04:06,016
Dated

2657
02:04:08,064 --> 02:04:08,576
We got him

2658
02:04:09,344 --> 02:04:09,856
What

2659
02:04:10,112 --> 02:04:10,624
Middle of

2660
02:04:10,880 --> 02:04:11,392
Nowhere Man

2661
02:04:11,648 --> 02:04:12,160
Fontana

2662
02:04:12,672 --> 02:04:13,440
Okay

2663
02:04:13,696 --> 02:04:15,488
Is he mad that the Postal Service works

2664
02:04:15,744 --> 02:04:16,256
No

2665
02:04:16,768 --> 02:04:17,280
No

2666
02:04:17,792 --> 02:04:18,560
He just think

2667
02:04:19,328 --> 02:04:20,096
That there is a

2668
02:04:20,608 --> 02:04:21,120
Spirits

2669
02:04:21,632 --> 02:04:23,680
Short about offering mail-in ballot

2670
02:04:23,936 --> 02:04:24,960
Options to people

2671
02:04:25,216 --> 02:04:28,288
That is how they're going to steal the 2020 election

2672
02:04:28,544 --> 02:04:29,568
Gotcha it's inevitable

2673
02:04:29,824 --> 02:04:33,408
But here he talks about that a little bit more and then I'll explain why this is dumb

2674
02:04:33,920 --> 02:04:35,968
I get to open his mail

2675
02:04:37,248 --> 02:04:38,784
They didn't send one to me by the way

2676
02:04:41,088 --> 02:04:42,112
Is that cuz he

2677
02:04:42,368 --> 02:04:48,000
Basically it's

2678
02:04:51,072 --> 02:04:51,584
Mail-in ballot

2679
02:04:52,352 --> 02:04:53,120
I'm scared of

2680
02:04:53,376 --> 02:04:54,144
Corona

2681
02:04:55,680 --> 02:04:57,216
Yeah

2682
02:04:57,472 --> 02:04:58,240
But there's a huge

2683
02:04:58,496 --> 02:04:59,776
Demand for that

2684
02:05:00,032 --> 02:05:02,592
So they can get it passed

2685
02:05:03,104 --> 02:05:03,872
Mail-in voting

2686
02:05:06,944 --> 02:05:10,272
Shein

2687
02:05:10,528 --> 02:05:11,808
So you are no fun fact

2688
02:05:12,576 --> 02:05:16,928
In 2008 when Obama won the presidency 2.4 million absentee ballots

2689
02:05:17,184 --> 02:05:17,696
Forecast

2690
02:05:17,952 --> 02:05:19,744
In 2016 when Trump won

2691
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:21,024
8.2 million

2692
02:05:21,280 --> 02:05:21,792
Forecast

2693
02:05:22,048 --> 02:05:23,328
The number word

2694
02:05:23,584 --> 02:05:27,168
In those years and yet somehow the votes weren't all secretly stolen by damn

2695
02:05:27,424 --> 02:05:29,984
As Alex seem to think mail-in ballots are set up to

2696
02:05:31,008 --> 02:05:32,800
These f****** idiots are talking like

2697
02:05:33,056 --> 02:05:34,848
Today was the first day they heard about ads

2698
02:05:36,128 --> 02:05:36,640
How many fix

2699
02:05:36,896 --> 02:05:41,248
Troops Wagner overseas

2700
02:05:41,760 --> 02:05:43,808
97% of troops overseas

2701
02:05:44,064 --> 02:05:44,576
Please vote for

2702
02:05:44,832 --> 02:05:50,464
I don't know about that a long time and work totally fine with that

2703
02:05:50,720 --> 02:05:51,488
Any kind of fraud

2704
02:05:52,256 --> 02:05:52,768
Suggested

2705
02:05:53,024 --> 02:05:57,376
We use mail-in voting to help keep the election on Pace is a very good idea that would

2706
02:05:57,888 --> 02:05:58,656
Every indication

2707
02:05:58,912 --> 02:06:01,728
From States like Oregon Washington and Colorado bear this out

2708
02:06:02,240 --> 02:06:04,288
This caller lives in Montana

2709
02:06:04,544 --> 02:06:05,312
And guess what

2710
02:06:05,824 --> 02:06:06,848
In the 2016 election

2711
02:06:07,104 --> 02:06:09,408
64.6% of all vote

2712
02:06:09,920 --> 02:06:12,224
Forecast by absentee mail-in or early voting

2713
02:06:12,480 --> 02:06:14,528
Trump won Montana was just over 50

2714
02:06:14,784 --> 02:06:15,552
6% of the vote

2715
02:06:16,064 --> 02:06:17,088
The conspiracy here is

2716
02:06:17,344 --> 02:06:18,112
Incredibly stupid

2717
02:06:18,368 --> 02:06:20,672
But it's important to remember that it doesn't matter if it's

2718
02:06:20,928 --> 02:06:21,696
Conspiracy

2719
02:06:21,952 --> 02:06:23,744
There's needed to feel good in order for it to

2720
02:06:24,768 --> 02:06:26,560
The goal here is to invalidate the result of

2721
02:06:26,816 --> 02:06:27,840
The 2020 election

2722
02:06:28,096 --> 02:06:28,864
In case Trump loser

2723
02:06:29,120 --> 02:06:31,168
There's a very good chance they will see

2724
02:06:31,424 --> 02:06:35,520
Increasing right in absentee ballots which is a good angle to build a narrative on

2725
02:06:36,288 --> 02:06:37,568
Feels like mail-in ballots

2726
02:06:37,824 --> 02:06:39,360
Would be easier to steal and fake

2727
02:06:39,616 --> 02:06:41,152
Because neither this collar nor Alex

2728
02:06:41,408 --> 02:06:42,688
Know anything about the absentee voting

2729
02:06:43,712 --> 02:06:45,248
Because it feels that way they

2730
02:06:45,504 --> 02:06:46,528
I can convey that feeling

2731
02:06:47,296 --> 02:06:48,576
People who are into this kind of prophet

2732
02:06:48,832 --> 02:06:51,648
Ganda aren't looking into things so they won't ever ask themselves

2733
02:06:51,904 --> 02:06:53,696
These feelings are based on any kind of reality

2734
02:06:53,952 --> 02:06:55,232
Epic riddle of Dowling

2735
02:06:55,744 --> 02:06:56,256
Grow

2736
02:06:56,768 --> 02:07:02,912
This is legitimately just a wholesale repeat of the ten million undocumented documented immigrants voted in

2737
02:07:03,168 --> 02:07:07,264
I was just about to bring that up that's why I didn't win the popular vote

2738
02:07:07,520 --> 02:07:11,360
Siri won the electoral college but he also would have won the popular vote

2739
02:07:11,616 --> 02:07:16,480
Probably by the largest margin in history if it weren't for those undocumented immigrants voting

2740
02:07:16,736 --> 02:07:18,784
There always needs to be an angle

2741
02:07:19,040 --> 02:07:20,320
And these are two narratives are

2742
02:07:20,576 --> 02:07:24,672
If Trump loses you now have an excuse why you actually want and you don't have to feel bad

2743
02:07:24,928 --> 02:07:31,072
If Trump wins you get to pretend that not only he want he overcame a billion write-in votes or whatever there's no downside

2744
02:07:31,328 --> 02:07:32,864
Side playing a strategy like this except

2745
02:07:33,120 --> 02:07:33,888
Anyone who knows anything

2746
02:07:34,144 --> 02:07:35,680
Easily recognize what you're doing

2747
02:07:35,936 --> 02:07:36,960
But it doesn't matter

2748
02:07:37,216 --> 02:07:37,728
Because

2749
02:07:38,240 --> 02:07:39,520
It'll work with your audience

2750
02:07:40,032 --> 02:07:40,800
Them guys

2751
02:07:41,312 --> 02:07:42,848
It's amazing they are both

2752
02:07:43,616 --> 02:07:44,128
Like

2753
02:07:45,408 --> 02:07:48,992
No matter what is going on including if they are the ones

2754
02:07:49,248 --> 02:07:51,296
And actively carrying out voter suppression

2755
02:07:51,552 --> 02:07:52,832
To steal an election

2756
02:07:53,856 --> 02:07:54,368
That is

2757
02:07:54,624 --> 02:07:55,136
Them

2758
02:07:55,648 --> 02:07:56,160
Like

2759
02:07:56,672 --> 02:08:02,816
We're stealing the people who are working at polling stations who deposits

2760
02:08:05,888 --> 02:08:08,192
Concerns here are

2761
02:08:08,960 --> 02:08:09,984
Pretty legit

2762
02:08:10,240 --> 02:08:12,288
Yeah no I when I I went to vote

2763
02:08:12,544 --> 02:08:14,848
And there were hundreds of people

2764
02:08:15,104 --> 02:08:16,128
Crammed into a small

2765
02:08:16,640 --> 02:08:22,784
Are we still hanging out it's it's unclear what sort of consequences could come or could have come from

2766
02:08:23,040 --> 02:08:24,320
They're already done

2767
02:08:25,344 --> 02:08:31,488
So Alex now gets down to talking to the other gas to run the gun shop and Austin or in Texas somewhere

2768
02:08:33,024 --> 02:08:33,536
He's not happy

2769
02:08:34,048 --> 02:08:34,816
About the

2770
02:08:35,328 --> 02:08:38,144
Guns not being considered essential businesses

2771
02:08:38,400 --> 02:08:39,424
During the shutdown

2772
02:08:39,936 --> 02:08:46,080
Many years ago and he hasn't

2773
02:08:46,336 --> 02:08:52,480
Great gun shop and training center here in Austin

2774
02:08:56,320 --> 02:08:57,856
Dot-com

2775
02:09:05,280 --> 02:09:07,328
Liquor Stores stay open

2776
02:09:12,960 --> 02:09:14,496
Everybody else basically submitted

2777
02:09:15,776 --> 02:09:16,288
And

2778
02:09:17,056 --> 02:09:17,824
He's got a letter

2779
02:09:21,408 --> 02:09:22,944
Attorney General

2780
02:09:23,200 --> 02:09:27,040
So the way Alex wants this narrative to sounds that they're targeting gun shops

2781
02:09:27,296 --> 02:09:28,832
Close them down but that's not true

2782
02:09:29,344 --> 02:09:32,160
You can do this with any type of store if you wanted to you could like

2783
02:09:32,416 --> 02:09:32,928
You to play games

2784
02:09:33,440 --> 02:09:34,976
If you're like a big car guy you can

2785
02:09:35,232 --> 02:09:36,768
You complain the dealerships are closed

2786
02:09:37,024 --> 02:09:37,792
You're a gambler

2787
02:09:38,048 --> 02:09:38,560
Play abacus

2788
02:09:38,816 --> 02:09:39,328
Beano's

2789
02:09:39,584 --> 02:09:40,864
And no matter what you

2790
02:09:41,120 --> 02:09:46,240
You choose to complain about you can always say what about liquor stores they're keeping the liquor stores in pot shops open

2791
02:09:47,264 --> 02:09:48,544
Marijuana shops are being kept open

2792
02:09:48,800 --> 02:09:50,592
Because for a lot of people that's straight-up medicine

2793
02:09:51,104 --> 02:09:52,384
You can pretend all you want that

2794
02:09:52,640 --> 02:09:54,944
It's just kids going to get high but what a main reasons

2795
02:09:55,200 --> 02:09:58,528
It's become legal in a number of states is there people with compelling medical reason

2796
02:09:58,784 --> 02:09:59,296
I have weed

2797
02:09:59,808 --> 02:10:01,600
Close and pop shops be bad for these people

2798
02:10:01,856 --> 02:10:04,160
And the way pot shop or setup lends himself

2799
02:10:04,416 --> 02:10:05,952
Easily incorporating social

2800
02:10:06,720 --> 02:10:08,256
It's required to operate safely

2801
02:10:08,512 --> 02:10:11,328
They're allowing pharmacies to remain open Dan.

2802
02:10:11,584 --> 02:10:14,912
That's disgusting what is a better prescription than a gun

2803
02:10:15,424 --> 02:10:16,704
As for liquor stores

2804
02:10:16,960 --> 02:10:20,544
If you close all the shops that were considered liquor stores you would seriously cut off of

2805
02:10:20,800 --> 02:10:22,336
A lot of people's access to their food

2806
02:10:22,592 --> 02:10:23,104
Fermentation

2807
02:10:23,360 --> 02:10:24,128
Not everyone lives

2808
02:10:24,384 --> 02:10:24,896
The place is worth

2809
02:10:25,152 --> 02:10:26,944
Convenient to go to a full-on grocery store

2810
02:10:27,200 --> 02:10:27,968
And taking public

2811
02:10:28,224 --> 02:10:30,272
Transit is not encouraged in these circumstances

2812
02:10:30,528 --> 02:10:32,576
You have a situation where it's even less

2813
02:10:32,832 --> 02:10:33,344
Accessible

2814
02:10:33,856 --> 02:10:38,464
Why do people in the country rely on corner stores and liquor stores that they also sell food items

2815
02:10:38,720 --> 02:10:39,488
Satisfy their shopping

2816
02:10:40,256 --> 02:10:41,280
The clothing that would be a

2817
02:10:41,536 --> 02:10:42,304
A f****** disaster

2818
02:10:42,816 --> 02:10:43,584
Are very much

2819
02:10:43,840 --> 02:10:45,376
Necessary so

2820
02:10:45,632 --> 02:10:46,144
Give me some really work

2821
02:10:46,656 --> 02:10:47,424
African

2822
02:10:47,680 --> 02:10:50,496
No one's forcing States or even cities to DM

2823
02:10:50,752 --> 02:10:51,264
Gun shops

2824
02:10:51,520 --> 02:10:53,312
Essential or on essential businesses

2825
02:10:53,824 --> 02:10:56,128
That's a decision that's left of these specific areas

2826
02:10:56,384 --> 02:10:56,896
Question

2827
02:10:57,152 --> 02:11:03,296
Even the notoriously left-wing California governor Gavin Newsom said that the decision about keeping gun shops open with

2828
02:11:03,552 --> 02:11:04,320
Local sheriff's

2829
02:11:05,344 --> 02:11:06,112
Feats of discretion

2830
02:11:06,368 --> 02:11:07,136
Now they want to deal with

2831
02:11:07,648 --> 02:11:10,976
Expensive Texas gun stores are being targeted than the only person

2832
02:11:11,232 --> 02:11:13,280
Complain about his old friend Governor Abbott

2833
02:11:14,048 --> 02:11:17,888
It doesn't matter though since I'm the same Davis episode came out Texas Attorney General

2834
02:11:18,144 --> 02:11:19,424
Ken Paxton release a statement

2835
02:11:19,680 --> 02:11:21,472
The gunshots were considered essential

2836
02:11:22,752 --> 02:11:23,264
From a shutdown

2837
02:11:23,520 --> 02:11:25,312
Ultimately the segment is pointless

2838
02:11:25,568 --> 02:11:26,080
And

2839
02:11:26,336 --> 02:11:29,408
The f****** dude he's talking to Michael Cargill even brings up

2840
02:11:29,664 --> 02:11:30,432
Ken Paxton

2841
02:11:31,456 --> 02:11:31,968
You can't

2842
02:11:32,224 --> 02:11:36,320
To their complaining that gunshot unreal essential while discussing how

2843
02:11:36,576 --> 02:11:38,112
The Attorney General said that they are

2844
02:11:38,880 --> 02:11:39,648
Cool great workout

2845
02:11:40,160 --> 02:11:40,928
Yeah nonsense

2846
02:11:41,440 --> 02:11:43,744
Not but it's just artificial grieve man it's

2847
02:11:44,000 --> 02:11:44,768
Nonsense

2848
02:11:45,280 --> 02:11:46,816
Three-point last clip in italics

2849
02:11:47,072 --> 02:11:48,608
Complaining about getting kicked off the app

2850
02:11:48,864 --> 02:11:52,448
Her and I really wish you was still talking about his religious beliefs in Aliens

2851
02:12:06,272 --> 02:12:06,784
What

2852
02:12:07,040 --> 02:12:09,344
Father on entrance form

2853
02:12:09,600 --> 02:12:13,440
Come on mother and father

2854
02:12:25,984 --> 02:12:28,032
Helpless people that go get college degrees

2855
02:12:31,360 --> 02:12:32,896
Building the posthuman worlds

2856
02:12:33,152 --> 02:12:34,432
Sabotaging everything

2857
02:12:42,368 --> 02:12:48,512
Airhorn sound effect

2858
02:12:48,768 --> 02:12:49,792
The show but

2859
02:12:50,304 --> 02:12:52,096
Yeah man I mean that's really just

2860
02:12:52,352 --> 02:12:54,144
Purest version of Alex

2861
02:12:55,168 --> 02:12:55,680
Weird

2862
02:12:56,192 --> 02:12:58,496
Secondary narrative about being

2863
02:12:58,752 --> 02:13:03,872
Kicked off the app that he's not even eat nothing but you're not into it I would much rather complain about the

2864
02:13:04,128 --> 02:13:07,456
The demons an alien spider

2865
02:13:07,968 --> 02:13:11,296
That seems to have fallen off his radar after the middle of the show

2866
02:13:11,552 --> 02:13:13,088
Butter at all just isn't service

2867
02:13:13,600 --> 02:13:14,112
Selling a ship

2868
02:13:14,624 --> 02:13:15,392
I have a I have

2869
02:13:15,904 --> 02:13:17,184
Like I can't imagine

2870
02:13:17,440 --> 02:13:17,952
Being

2871
02:13:18,464 --> 02:13:19,744
Able to read

2872
02:13:20,256 --> 02:13:21,792
Is a wired article with a

2873
02:13:22,048 --> 02:13:23,584
A quote that I gave that fly

2874
02:13:25,632 --> 02:13:29,728
Their intervention interdimensional demon

2875
02:13:29,984 --> 02:13:33,312
Alien demon I apologize servant interdimensional thing

2876
02:13:33,568 --> 02:13:34,080
Horse

2877
02:13:34,336 --> 02:13:39,712
Quote interdimensional thinking out loud

2878
02:13:39,968 --> 02:13:44,576
That's the thing I said I nailed it and you know what that's my religion

2879
02:13:46,112 --> 02:13:48,160
A new read that allowed in

2880
02:13:48,416 --> 02:13:51,744
Research

2881
02:13:54,048 --> 02:13:55,584
Betty White

2882
02:13:55,840 --> 02:13:56,864
Nothing he's jealous

2883
02:13:57,632 --> 02:13:59,936
So I guess I'm kind of satisfied in some ways

2884
02:14:00,192 --> 02:14:00,704
Because

2885
02:14:00,960 --> 02:14:05,056
This episode was not as coronavirus heavy which I can appreciate

2886
02:14:05,568 --> 02:14:07,104
And we got

2887
02:14:07,360 --> 02:14:07,872
Experience

2888
02:14:08,128 --> 02:14:10,176
Like what a really said

2889
02:14:10,688 --> 02:14:11,712
Floating exist

2890
02:14:11,968 --> 02:14:16,320
Just Treading Water kind of guy have you responds to these really negative things in their life

2891
02:14:16,832 --> 02:14:21,440
I do I think it's almost at the point where he's not even angry about these things

2892
02:14:21,696 --> 02:14:26,816
He's probably pretty angry but also looks so burnt out on being angry at them they just like f******

2893
02:14:27,328 --> 02:14:30,144
