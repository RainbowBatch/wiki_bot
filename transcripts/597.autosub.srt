1
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:20,736
Damn important

2
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:27,136
I have great respect for its knowledge B

3
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:56,320
Knowledge fight

4
00:00:56,576 --> 00:01:02,720
Dot-com

5
00:01:03,744 --> 00:01:09,120
The altar of Celine and talk a little bit about Alex Jones

6
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,216
Jordan is

7
00:01:13,472 --> 00:01:19,104
I'm continuing on with season 32 Survivor I think that there's

8
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,384
Straight up trying to give people

9
00:01:21,152 --> 00:01:24,480
Okay like I have that actually makes me want to watch Survivor

10
00:01:24,736 --> 00:01:27,040
I've been saying since the beginning like

11
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:29,088
Someone's got to die on the show

12
00:01:29,344 --> 00:01:30,880
And now we get to see him there to it like

13
00:01:33,184 --> 00:01:35,488
Make me a little bit uncomfortable

14
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:38,816
I don't want to give anything away in case anyone actually wants to

15
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:40,352
See it but years old

16
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:41,120
It's not like

17
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:42,144
You know

18
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:45,984
There's one episode where there's a challenge and like

19
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:49,056
People are dropping like flies

20
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:50,336
Okay

21
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:52,896
I've watched all the seasons

22
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:56,224
There's been nothing like this like a couple episodes in

23
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,248
I'm like someone's death

24
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:00,320
Okay

25
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:02,112
They have to call an audible

26
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:05,440
They have to call an audible roast is calling in like

27
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:09,280
All non-emergency staff to come fan people off

28
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:10,816
Alright

29
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:12,096
Not okay

30
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:13,888
Definitely

31
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:17,216
Like there's a lot of stuff on that show that appears to be like it's a little bit

32
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:17,984
But stage

33
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:21,568
I think people were legitimately freaked out

34
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:23,360
Spaghetti Pizza it was it was

35
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:30,016
Anytime there's those reality TV show freak-outs though it's almost always like the task is so mad

36
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:32,320
Meticulously planned and then it's like

37
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:33,088
Oops

38
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:35,136
It's 110° on this day

39
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:41,792
We're going to go ahead and give it a shot anyways and you're like none of the problem isn't that the thing you guys were planning on doing his

40
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:43,584
Bad it's that these people are going to die

41
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,864
Of heat exhaustion

42
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:49,472
They don't have enough water

43
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:51,520
Physically strenuous for an hour

44
00:02:55,104 --> 00:02:57,664
Hey

45
00:02:58,176 --> 00:03:03,296
That's why I like watching Naked and Afraid cuz when they find themselves in like 120° they're all like

46
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:05,344
We were just going to lay down today

47
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,136
What today is

48
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:08,160
You know what

49
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:11,232
What's remarkable about it is that everybody was

50
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:15,584
Shockingly chill about it

51
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,632
Like if I were on the show I would be

52
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:18,912
Furious approach

53
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:19,680
Sure

54
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:24,288
I bet you did this you know what I mean is that just a sort of

55
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:25,312
Blind Trust

56
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:28,384
Is there a sort of blind Trust of like oh well we're on

57
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,176
On TV there's no way that we

58
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:35,040
Die you know there's no way that these people would be irresponsible enough to let it

59
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:40,416
Died of heat exhaustion what I was thinking until this season

60
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:48,608
Everyone's totally safe it's on TV I understand that there's like venomous creatures at view but like

61
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:51,936
You know there's people with blow darts of antivenin.

62
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:52,960
On standby

63
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:55,264
I am no longer confident that

64
00:03:55,776 --> 00:03:56,544
Someone could

65
00:03:57,312 --> 00:03:58,080
Possibly not

66
00:03:58,336 --> 00:04:00,128
Is there any of them

67
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:06,528
The day after that they were like that exact same you know I was really confident that we were not going to die no matter what

68
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:07,296
And now I

69
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:12,160
Yeah this is Game of Thrones now all of our favorite characters

70
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:15,488
Could die at any moment I mean like not like

71
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,791
Totally talked too much about this but like

72
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:21,631
There have been people who have been medically evacuated before

73
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:27,007
Yeah it's happened in previous Seasons shut light

74
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:28,287
Whatever

75
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:30,079
This isn't actually think like

76
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:39,551
This is killing me this is why I keep going back to Nick and Afraid whenever you talk about Survivor because with a negative

77
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:42,879
Afraid it's so amazing to me they'll be the will

78
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:44,159
Medically evacuate people

79
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:48,511
All the time because you're naked in the middle of a place where you're not supposed to be

80
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:49,791
Which is why you're terrified

81
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:52,863
Just injure themselves like nothing

82
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:55,679
Non-stop but these people are so f******

83
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:57,215
Crazy that they'll be like

84
00:04:57,471 --> 00:05:01,823
Alright well it's day three in my ankle is 6 times the size of my forehead

85
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:06,687
I just don't want to go home you know I don't want to tap out

86
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:11,039
Yeah you see their leg like dangling with a broken f***

87
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:13,343
Tibia

88
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:14,623
You know I don't want to tap out

89
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:19,743
Survivor it's like I have I'm sure they'll take care of it and episode that I just watch

90
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:21,023
Boys like

91
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:23,583
Multiple people on the show

92
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:24,351
Have

93
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:26,911
Threatening infection

94
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:31,007
They have cuts that have gotten infected

95
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:36,639
People summer like I'm sure it's 5

96
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:40,479
Located where

97
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:43,295
Dirt is getting it to our moon

98
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:49,183
But I'm sure it's fine we're going to have to start calling this game green because this is not going well

99
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:52,511
Responsible

100
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:54,047
It's actually

101
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:57,631
I think it's elevated my enjoyment of the shower

102
00:05:57,887 --> 00:06:00,191
Real

103
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:04,031
Well I mean anything that gets to 32 years old there's a good chance something

104
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:05,311
He's going to die

105
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:07,871
Keep it fresh exactly

106
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:11,199
Damn I think you know what my bright spot is so

107
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:15,807
Straight from the White Sox Angels game earlier

108
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:22,463
Sure and then I went to the Angels game last night

109
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:25,279
He was in person

110
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:26,303
Yeah

111
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:32,703
Statuesque sure built like a brick shithouse just an amazing man

112
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:36,287
He didn't have a good game yesterday

113
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:38,847
That's strikeouts today

114
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:39,871
Blah better

115
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:43,967
244 and then I was so disappointed

116
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:45,247
Because okay

117
00:06:45,503 --> 00:06:47,295
Baroness / 5 is a

118
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:48,063
Vine

119
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:54,463
Friday for a picture

120
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:59,327
Sadly for the second place the home run hitter in the league over 5 is not a

121
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:02,655
The reason that you have

122
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:03,423
To go see him live

123
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:07,263
And this is something that baseball people with State pattern

124
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:13,663
Absolutely false

125
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:15,455
I got to go see.

126
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:19,295
With weather tonight

127
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:22,623
One of the things about baseball is that if you're really really good

128
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:24,415
Like really really good

129
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:26,207
Then the ball sounds

130
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:32,607
Front when you hit it like Vlad Guerrero Jr now is the league leader in home runs of 45 and when he gets ahold of

131
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:33,887
It sounds different

132
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:36,447
From every other player

133
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:37,471
Exact

134
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:43,871
And taking Out to the Ballgame I was really hoping for

135
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:45,919
2 days into game

136
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:46,687
Games to get it

137
00:07:46,943 --> 00:07:48,479
But he hit a ball

138
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:49,503
So f***

139
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:50,271
Working hard

140
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:51,295
The crack

141
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:53,343
Echo throughout the

142
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:55,391
The crowd unfortunately it was a foul ball

143
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:57,695
But he hid it so f****** hard Uke

144
00:07:57,951 --> 00:07:58,463
Could hear it

145
00:07:58,975 --> 00:08:00,511
And it was beautiful

146
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:04,095
I don't know if I

147
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:10,495
Watched enough baseball to know the distinction in sounds but I ate the sound of a ball getting hit is very satisfying

148
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:14,335
Satisfying long enough you know you can tell the difference

149
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:20,735
Between when Barry Bonds hit a homerun and when

150
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:22,527
Point where I still remember

151
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:24,831
When I was playing baseball and I was like

152
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:25,599
Like 70

153
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:26,367
Team

154
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:28,671
We were playing in the playoffs

155
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:31,231
And this team was terrible

156
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:33,535
And we were terrible also

157
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:34,815
But this kid

158
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:36,095
This one kid

159
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:36,863
Was

160
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:38,655
Just a

161
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:40,191
A bigger kids and everybody else

162
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:42,239
And he couldn't move

163
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:43,519
Couldn't run

164
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:44,799
Couldn't do anything

165
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:46,591
But when he hit that f****** ball

166
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:48,639
The Sounds workout

167
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:51,455
My ear like he hid it so well

168
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:54,783
And he couldn't do anything else and I was like man that guy

169
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:58,367
We got a bottle of that

170
00:08:58,623 --> 00:08:59,391
The f*** out of here

171
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:05,791
Steph secondary Brightside for me actually has been watching you so just be a fan

172
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:07,583
It's kind of fun

173
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:10,399
There is a reminds me of like a

174
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:11,423
A more innocent time

175
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:14,239
I like being able to excitement of going

176
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:15,007
To see this

177
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:16,031
Player live

178
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:18,335
Oh yeah

179
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:20,127
Some enjoyment out of that so

180
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:22,943
Thank you it's just hard to believe that there's only one of

181
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:25,247
There's only one and it's like

182
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:26,527
I mean

183
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:27,551
Oh okay

184
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:32,159
Better and I should talk on Babe Ruth all the time because they only played against white players who gives

185
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:33,439
The fuk what he did

186
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:34,463
Just remote

187
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:36,511
Racist a random Justin Moore statista

188
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:37,279
Physical standpoint

189
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:39,071
At Babe Ruth's time

190
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:40,351
This is people

191
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:41,631
F****** fighting

192
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:42,911
Coming off of a war

193
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:50,591
2 million people in the United States

194
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:55,711
Maybe a million white people in United States to draw a talent

195
00:09:56,735 --> 00:09:59,551
Right so somebody who can hit and picture

196
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:00,319
At the same time

197
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:01,855
Out of a million people

198
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:02,623
Not

199
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:03,391
Terribly

200
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:04,159
Surprising

201
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:07,999
Scary and unusual but not terribly surprising

202
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:10,815
Shohei ohtani is 1 out of a billion

203
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:11,839
Potential people

204
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:12,863
Secret play

Back to the Press

214
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:36,159

So we're going to get down to business on this there's some real

220
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:54,079
Gyms in here slow start but then towards the end may be one of the most

221
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:57,151
Bizarre Clips I've heard in a long time

222
00:10:57,919 --> 00:10:59,711
And also further evidence that I think

223
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:02,015
But maybe this is a parody

224
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:08,415
Okay again. Alex is desperately trying to tell the world I've been joking this whole time

225
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:10,719

245
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:16,767
Hey what's up to a new member of saline

246
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:23,167
Up at 8

247
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:24,191
A b a b

248
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:26,495
I think so maybe

249
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:30,079
That's a very short-term adoption

250
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:32,895
I am not sure if this was just a single be adoption

251
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:34,431
But there will be an avatar of a

252
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:36,223
Furby in Saline family

253
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:41,855
And this is the only be that I will make these with cuz you know I have a war with Abby

254
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:44,927
I mean is it a truce

255
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:48,255
Sorathi spider on your or perhaps

256
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:50,303
It's an uneasy truce some guy

257
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:54,143
Cuz my brother raise bees and when I went to go see them

258
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:56,447
I was shocked by how little they paid attention

259
00:12:56,703 --> 00:13:01,055
Come to me and I was not afraid of them at all they went about their business flying around me

260
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:01,823
Yeah

261
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:07,711
I'm fine with bees and all the joys elincia the bet

262
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:08,991
The family

263
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:10,783
Valencia

264
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:12,319
This show starts

265
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:13,343
Slow

266
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:16,927
First 20 minutes of the show are Alex

267
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:20,255

00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:22,559
Artist desk

270

All this video coming up so see

272
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:33,823
Now it's all out in the open

273
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:39,455
It's just that

274
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:43,807
Like a little bit of a headline and then long video

275
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:45,855
Famous newscaster

276
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:46,879
Compelling hunt

277
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:49,951
But when he does get back there's something important that he does

278
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:56,863
When I get up in my head in a little bit worried that he's going to find out about

279
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:57,631
Auto Show

280
00:13:57,887 --> 00:13:58,655
How do I feel

281
00:13:58,911 --> 00:14:00,703
Property tax

282
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:03,007
And every now and again we got to re-up

283
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:08,127
I mean for us to do exactly the show that we're doing

284
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:13,247
Send archives the shows in Article 2 videos

285
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:23,999

286
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:29,375
Okay

287
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:31,423
Alright we're son

288
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:36,543
That's a worry about that anymore I think we've got one from that's

289
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:37,567
From 2021

290
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:39,615
We got at least one from 29th

291
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:41,151
India pretty sure we've got

292
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:47,039
Three pattern looks like

293
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:48,831
Whatever you want to get up

294
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:49,855
Target

295
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:51,647
So we got some sad news

296
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:57,279
014 Larry Nichols okay

297
00:14:58,047 --> 00:15:01,119
Bad news for your hanging out

298
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:05,983
Playing golf with the California recall

299
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:07,263
Let's get

300
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:10,591
The really sad news your butt understand

301
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:11,359
There's a

302
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:12,895
Major Ray

303
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:15,455
Sunshine or or silver lining

304
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:16,735
In This Cloud

305
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:20,575
It's going to get people up off their butt

306
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:24,927
In the midterms now

307
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:25,951
Only

308
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:32,863
Is everybody

309
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:34,655
2

310
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:36,447
Really push back and expose what's happening

311
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:39,263
I talked about this a thousand times again

312
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:42,079
Fornia isn't really

313
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:43,103
Blue

314
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:46,943
Connecticut's not really blue

315
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:49,503
Vermont's not really blue

316
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:51,807
Michigan's not really blue

317
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:55,135
There is such fraud

318
00:15:56,927 --> 00:15:59,231
In States like Pennsylvania and Georgia where they

319
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:05,887
When we control everything else

320
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:08,703
Just play ball with us and Taylor's on fraud

321
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:10,495
So yeah the it's all

322
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:11,519
It's all cheating

323
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:15,871
Every election now California is not really blue

324
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:18,431
So the one thing that I think

325
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:19,711
Just about everybody

326
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:21,759
Could have agreed on 5 years ago

327
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:28,159
California was so thoroughly f****** blue hard never change anything

328
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:29,183
Twitter Democrat

329
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:32,511
Everyone would say California just blew and f***

330
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:33,535
Not anymore

331
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:40,447
Nevermind never has been in all of the places that are blue states that are blue states are actually not they are all

332
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:42,751
80% Trump

333
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:43,775
20%.

334
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:45,823
Probably that's why we need a fake

335
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:47,615
Re-election

336
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:48,639
Yeah it's just

337
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:50,175
I mean I can't help

338
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:51,967
But feel like there's a certain amount of like

339
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:52,991
For this

340
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:54,015
Community

341
00:16:54,783 --> 00:16:55,551
Democracy has failed

342
00:16:55,807 --> 00:17:01,951
Oh yeah never have an election that is perceived as anything other

343
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:03,231
Other than complete that

344
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:08,351
Later on they even talked about like Ron DeSantis winning re-election

345
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:10,911
And it's like it's not even enough that he won

346
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:12,447
He should have one more

347
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:14,239
The fact that he won

348
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:17,055
And it was closed memes that there was a fat

349
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:17,823
Okay

350
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:24,223
All right it is amazing cuz it does make you think like when people see

351
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:27,551
See that Putin won with 97% of the vote there's a

352
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:28,319
There's a

353
00:17:28,575 --> 00:17:30,623
Pretty significant percentages that's like

354
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:32,159
Yeah that's about right

355
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:33,439
Cuz he's great

356
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:36,767
Is a strong leader ninety-seven percent of people shoot approval

357
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:38,559
Yahoo

358
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:40,863
How to use fake ballots

359
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:42,399
Of course naturally

360
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:43,679
Just like you know 22

361
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:47,263
The balance

362
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:50,079
Through flooding provisional balancing

363
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:51,615
Flooding mail-in ballot

364
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:53,151
That use Excuse of K

365
00:17:58,527 --> 00:17:59,551
11 months ago

366
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:01,087
2020 election

367
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:04,415
Two-plus weeks

368
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:08,511
Of these balance

369
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:11,071
Course they had a bunch held back behind

370
00:18:11,327 --> 00:18:13,119
Republicans

371
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:16,703
Take a percentage

372
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:20,287
40 30%

373
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:22,847
Computerized

374
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:24,895
Fill out the balance

375
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:28,735
Pennsylvania

376
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:32,063
Postal workers

377
00:18:32,575 --> 00:18:34,623
Unfolded all bubbletron

378
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:37,695
With only the race

379
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:39,999
Manforce

380
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:48,703
Also

381
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:53,567
Here it is you knew it was coming

382
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:55,871
You knew it was coming early so you knew this Ark

383
00:18:57,663 --> 00:18:59,967
Would you consider the Democrats have

384
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:00,991
Taken

385
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:03,295
Taken isn't

386
00:19:03,551 --> 00:19:05,855
Interesting word to describe the way the Democrats have

387
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:08,159
Power in the

388
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:09,439
Send it yeah

389
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:10,719
Eat some

390
00:19:12,511 --> 00:19:16,095
Compelling and I know that it's going to be exactly what Alex is after every

391
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:17,631
Single action

392
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:18,399
Ever again

393
00:19:18,911 --> 00:19:23,775
So there were some things that came out of the California recall

394
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:25,567
Things that we reported that we're

395
00:19:25,823 --> 00:19:27,615
Maybe slightly suspicious chair

396
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:28,383
Here's one of them

397
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:34,015
California

398
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:37,087
Miller shooting videos

399
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:41,951
When workers go sorry

400
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:45,791
Yeah she's already voted here's a provisional it'll be counted in a week that one can

401
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:50,143
I don't think that they said this is a provisional ballot that it won't be counted in a week

402
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:53,471
That makes up a weird thing to say

403
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:55,775
A couple of reports

404
00:19:56,031 --> 00:20:00,895
That you can find of people who found out the pay or were listed as having already voted

405
00:20:01,151 --> 00:20:03,199
When they showed up

406
00:20:03,455 --> 00:20:04,479
Voting place

407
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:11,135
And they got provisional ballots and that's something that happens because

408
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:11,903
Computers

409
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:16,511
Do you have a job where Computing errors happened to happen sometimes may happen

410
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:18,047
I don't want to stay over like

411
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:19,583
Entire James

412
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:20,863
Running intellect

413
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:21,887
You're going to have

414
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:23,167
Things like this

415
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:28,543
Panda you have is actually kind of argument that things are working cuz there's a back-up plan.

416
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:29,823
Supervision

417
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:32,639
Are there for this specific reason

418
00:20:32,895 --> 00:20:34,943
It does feel a lot like

419
00:20:35,711 --> 00:20:40,831
These people are acting like shity patrons at a bar and the waiter is like

420
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:42,623
Constantly trying to help this like

421
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:47,231
Look I'm so sorry I'm so sorry we just made a mistake in the kitchen here I'm going to go back up

422
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:50,047
Take 2 seconds here we go go to fix it

423
00:20:50,303 --> 00:20:52,095
And they throw the meal away and they like

424
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:56,191
You know

425
00:20:57,471 --> 00:21:00,031
So looking at understand that there's so much evidence

426
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:01,055
Of

427
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:03,359
Like you know

428
00:21:03,615 --> 00:21:04,383
I can Pennsylvania

429
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:06,175
Trump

430
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:06,943
Huge crowds

431
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:07,967
No

432
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:09,503
Huge crowd

433
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:14,367
Just but that's not annoying

434
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:18,720
Losers

435
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,840
Is only one postal worker that went public and goes

436
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:25,888
Another state

437
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:29,984
Disrespect something was supposed to

438
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,776
Supposed to do

439
00:21:32,288 --> 00:21:35,360
He looks in the damn thing just what's in the box and see what it is

440
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:37,408
Call balance

441
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:38,176
Alex's

442
00:21:38,432 --> 00:21:38,944
Conflating store

443
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:43,040
He's here what actually happened was that there was a postal worker named Richard

444
00:21:43,296 --> 00:21:44,576
Who came forward after the election

445
00:21:44,832 --> 00:21:46,368
Pennsylvania claiming that he quote

446
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:52,512
Overheard the local postmaster discussing plans to backdate ballots received after they November 3rd vote

447
00:21:52,768 --> 00:21:54,560
And pass them off to election officials as a

448
00:21:54,816 --> 00:21:55,840
Legitimately

449
00:21:56,096 --> 00:21:56,864
Hopkins

450
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:03,008
Glam through project Veritas and it gained a lot of traction in the right-wing dum dum media is evidence of widespread voter fraud

451
00:22:03,776 --> 00:22:06,848
Naturally an investigation of these claims was launched and at that point

452
00:22:07,104 --> 00:22:08,896
Hopkins recanted his allegations

453
00:22:09,152 --> 00:22:09,920
Because when there's an

454
00:22:10,176 --> 00:22:15,808
Investigation the stakes are real whenever you might get in trouble

455
00:22:16,064 --> 00:22:17,088
When you're just talking s***

456
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:20,928
James O'Keefe there's no rules or Consequences so you can just say whatever you want

457
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,464
In an interview with the

458
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,232
Navigation Hopkin

459
00:22:23,488 --> 00:22:25,792
Quote revised his initial claims event

460
00:22:26,048 --> 00:22:27,584
Simply stating that he had not

461
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,376
Heard a conversation about balance

462
00:22:29,632 --> 00:22:30,144
At all

463
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:36,544
Rather he saw the postmaster and supervisor having a discussion and assumed it was about fraudulent backdated

464
00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:37,568
Great

465
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:39,872
Some good stuff literally that's all that

466
00:22:40,384 --> 00:22:46,528
This dude saw two people having a conversation and he decided to make up a story about what they were talking about which was then reported by James

467
00:22:46,784 --> 00:22:48,320
Luke even has proof of election meddling

468
00:22:48,832 --> 00:22:54,464
When sincere people try to look into the claims and it becomes clear that Hopkins going to be a big trouble if he makes

469
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,512
False allegations against people

470
00:22:56,768 --> 00:22:57,536
Arkansas claim

471
00:22:57,792 --> 00:23:00,096
But there's no retraction of the story by the right way

472
00:23:00,352 --> 00:23:01,120
Dum dum media

473
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:04,960
You don't put out a report where they discussed how they were wrong and they got that information

474
00:23:05,472 --> 00:23:09,312
James O'Keefe doesn't have to give back all the money he fundraise off pushing this fake story

475
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:15,456
And you can see now even in 2021 Alex is still using the basic details of this story while embellishing a ton of it

476
00:23:15,712 --> 00:23:16,480
The basically claim

477
00:23:16,736 --> 00:23:19,040
The California recall must have also been stolen

478
00:23:19,808 --> 00:23:23,136
This is the state of work and effort that goes into the media sphere that Alex is apart of

479
00:23:23,648 --> 00:23:26,208
None of these people are serious about the information they present

480
00:23:26,464 --> 00:23:27,488
Because if they were

481
00:23:27,744 --> 00:23:30,304
Three-quarters of their show would just be them having

482
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:31,072
The correct things

483
00:23:31,584 --> 00:23:33,376
It would just be wall-to-wall correction

484
00:23:33,632 --> 00:23:34,912
They don't give a fuk

485
00:23:35,168 --> 00:23:40,032
Yeah I know I mean if if anything we're going to have been done about this problem

486
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:42,592
Then the three million voters

487
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:43,872
Tweet

488
00:23:44,384 --> 00:23:48,480
From the 2016 election where is like 3 million illegals voted in this election

489
00:23:48,736 --> 00:23:53,600
And it's just some a****** tweeting and then it turned into a national story somebody would have done something about it then

490
00:23:53,856 --> 00:23:54,368
Shirley

491
00:23:54,624 --> 00:23:55,904
And if it didn't happen then

492
00:23:57,184 --> 00:23:57,696
Who gives a f***

493
00:23:57,952 --> 00:23:58,464
Yeah

494
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:02,304
Not not all of Alex's coverage

495
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:04,608
On this side this episode

496
00:24:04,864 --> 00:24:06,400
High-minded politics

497
00:24:07,168 --> 00:24:13,312
Some of it is getting down into the nitty-gritty sure some of it is getting down into the culture issues that matter

498
00:24:13,824 --> 00:24:19,968
The culture issues yeah the matter

499
00:24:20,224 --> 00:24:20,992
Met Gala

500
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:24,064
What's happening in California

00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:29,440
$50,000 a plate Hollywood Gala

502
00:24:34,048 --> 00:24:34,560

Thousand

504
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,632
Is that how you're going to grow up that dress

505
00:24:37,888 --> 00:24:40,448
On the Democrats Richard politicians

506
00:24:49,152 --> 00:24:49,920
Latino

507
00:24:50,176 --> 00:24:50,944
Mulatto women

508
00:24:51,712 --> 00:24:54,528
What type of

509
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:56,832
Hello boy oh boy

510
00:24:57,344 --> 00:24:58,624
Alicia

511
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:00,928
Yeah I mean

512
00:25:01,184 --> 00:25:03,232
I guess this is probably the reaction

513
00:25:03,744 --> 00:25:09,888
AOC might have expected from someone like Alex

514
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:15,264
Alex is the one that looks like an ass all here

515
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:17,312
31

516
00:25:17,568 --> 00:25:18,592
I think so

517
00:25:18,848 --> 00:25:23,968
And it's not like she's only wearing dresses with statements on them to do so legislator

518
00:25:24,736 --> 00:25:25,504
They're doing a lot of that

519
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:26,272
Stop

520
00:25:26,528 --> 00:25:28,064
Well just like

521
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,904
If she were just a figure that only existed to

522
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,184
To do publicity stunts

523
00:25:33,696 --> 00:25:35,744
I would kind of understand the outrage

524
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:38,048
Instead

525
00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:39,840
She's a legislator who is getting

526
00:25:40,352 --> 00:25:41,120
Some other things done

527
00:25:41,632 --> 00:25:47,520
And then also doing this to drive people like Alex crazy and make him end up saying things like

528
00:25:48,032 --> 00:25:49,568
Yeah yeah I mean it doesn't

529
00:25:49,824 --> 00:25:51,104
Seem like a right-wing media

530
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:57,504
Picks up all those stories where it's like a OC's office during flood goes out around

531
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:00,064
Call of individuals tries and helps them get to safety

532
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:04,928
Too much of that is to say that like obviously

533
00:26:05,184 --> 00:26:06,208
She's still a politician

534
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:06,976
She still has

535
00:26:07,488 --> 00:26:08,768
No blind spots and things

536
00:26:09,024 --> 00:26:10,048
Things that are not ideal

537
00:26:10,304 --> 00:26:11,584
About her but you know

538
00:26:12,608 --> 00:26:13,888
Caricature that

539
00:26:14,144 --> 00:26:15,168
Painted baby boy Galaxy

540
00:26:15,424 --> 00:26:17,728
Funny

541
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,264
It's pretty funny

542
00:26:19,776 --> 00:26:20,800
So Alex

543
00:26:21,056 --> 00:26:22,080
You know what

544
00:26:22,336 --> 00:26:23,872
Things that he is super against

545
00:26:24,128 --> 00:26:24,896
Is like

546
00:26:25,152 --> 00:26:25,920
World government

547
00:26:26,176 --> 00:26:26,688
Tyranny

548
00:26:28,736 --> 00:26:30,016
Things that I think is

549
00:26:30,528 --> 00:26:32,320
Salient about that is

550
00:26:32,832 --> 00:26:33,344
Like you know

551
00:26:33,856 --> 00:26:34,624
Colonialism

552
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:36,160
To our food is bad

553
00:26:36,672 --> 00:26:38,464
Because you know what is world government

554
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,512
Other than colonialism over every

555
00:26:41,024 --> 00:26:43,584
Once it becomes a world government than nothing

556
00:26:44,608 --> 00:26:45,120
Well

557
00:26:45,376 --> 00:26:49,984
I know that Alex is he's not a fan

558
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,592
Wait. Okay

559
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:02,528
PC cases

560
00:27:07,136 --> 00:27:09,184
200 Ferraris for their son

561
00:27:10,208 --> 00:27:12,256
25 Jets including jumbo jet

562
00:27:12,768 --> 00:27:15,072
15 Jets

563
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,120
Publix

564
00:27:17,632 --> 00:27:18,400
Madison

565
00:27:22,752 --> 00:27:24,032
When there was Europeans

566
00:27:27,616 --> 00:27:29,408
Madison

567
00:27:35,296 --> 00:27:36,832
Areas of Africa

568
00:27:37,344 --> 00:27:43,488
Wanda they had a Christian minority of black Nonono Nonono

569
00:27:47,584 --> 00:27:48,864
The build a civilization

570
00:27:59,104 --> 00:28:00,640
Collapsed amazing

571
00:28:00,896 --> 00:28:05,504
You can't really make it much clearer than that Alex is super into apartheid and colonialism

572
00:28:06,016 --> 00:28:12,160
Also with Alex read any books at all they were put out by the John Birch Society he might have understanding of the Rwanda genocide

573
00:28:12,416 --> 00:28:14,720
Poseidon the underlying dynamics that we're at play there

574
00:28:15,232 --> 00:28:21,376
We've gone over this in-depth another episode but the issue is not that one group with Christian and prosperous of the UN paid the

575
00:28:21,632 --> 00:28:22,656
The other animus group two killed

576
00:28:23,424 --> 00:28:28,032
It is far more to do with cultural tensions going back to the roots of Belgian colonialism in the country

577
00:28:28,288 --> 00:28:28,800
And how they chose

578
00:28:29,056 --> 00:28:31,360
The tootsie is the ethnic group that that a trusted with

579
00:28:31,616 --> 00:28:33,664
With power though the Hutu represented the vast

580
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:34,688
Majority of the population

581
00:28:35,456 --> 00:28:36,992
They're all kinds of Dynamics

582
00:28:37,248 --> 00:28:38,016
They grew out of that

583
00:28:38,784 --> 00:28:40,832
What Alex is doing a genocide revisionism

584
00:28:41,088 --> 00:28:44,928
I'm going to be every bit as offensive is when he makes up nonsense about WWII

585
00:28:45,184 --> 00:28:45,696
Like legit

586
00:28:46,208 --> 00:28:46,976
This dude

587
00:28:49,792 --> 00:28:51,840
Believable

588
00:28:52,096 --> 00:28:53,120
That is kind of like

589
00:28:53,376 --> 00:28:54,656
Like even in his store UK

590
00:28:54,912 --> 00:28:55,936
You can see the outline of

591
00:28:56,192 --> 00:28:57,216
The truth where he's like

592
00:28:57,472 --> 00:29:03,616
You know whether they didn't have anything in the white people came over they had electricity and then the white people left in there they didn't

593
00:29:03,872 --> 00:29:04,640
Have anything you like

594
00:29:04,896 --> 00:29:09,248
Well then maybe the story is the white people showed up and stole everything and then left

595
00:29:09,504 --> 00:29:10,016
With it

596
00:29:12,064 --> 00:29:15,392
What are the other things that you like I don't think a lot of people understand is that like

597
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:17,696
The John Birch

598
00:29:17,952 --> 00:29:19,744
Society an anti-communist types

599
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:20,512
Like they

600
00:29:20,768 --> 00:29:22,560
They were very into

601
00:29:22,816 --> 00:29:24,352
South African apartheid

602
00:29:24,608 --> 00:29:25,376
Is the proving

603
00:29:25,888 --> 00:29:28,192
It was them it was them looking at

604
00:29:28,448 --> 00:29:28,960
Like

605
00:29:29,216 --> 00:29:29,984
If this work

606
00:29:30,496 --> 00:29:31,264
Then we can take

607
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:32,032
Global

608
00:29:32,288 --> 00:29:35,616
That's what the birchers looked at the South

609
00:29:35,872 --> 00:29:36,384
Freaking apartheid

610
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:38,688
Afrikaners as it's like

611
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:42,272
If we can conquer this place and pick it up white nationalist Utopia

612
00:29:42,528 --> 00:29:44,064
Then guess what we can take the

613
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:48,928
Global whether or not it was proof-of-concept or not it was

614
00:29:49,184 --> 00:29:49,952
Very much

615
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:53,280
A convenient way to frame

616
00:29:53,536 --> 00:29:59,680
Support for apartheid as actually opposition to communist

617
00:29:59,936 --> 00:30:01,728
Ideas have trickled down to Alex's

618
00:30:02,752 --> 00:30:04,544
Like his positions in the present day

619
00:30:05,056 --> 00:30:05,824
Sure that is

620
00:30:06,592 --> 00:30:08,384
Somebody I don't think you can understand the

621
00:30:08,896 --> 00:30:09,408
No

622
00:30:09,664 --> 00:30:10,688
I agree with you

623
00:30:11,456 --> 00:30:12,992
So there's a war against the family

624
00:30:21,696 --> 00:30:23,232
Australian with your black or white

625
00:30:25,792 --> 00:30:27,840
I was thinking about this

626
00:30:29,632 --> 00:30:31,168
What I do

627
00:30:32,192 --> 00:30:34,240
I don't know if I do this with a

628
00:30:34,496 --> 00:30:35,008
Blast

629
00:30:36,544 --> 00:30:37,056
Today

630
00:30:38,592 --> 00:30:39,104
I have

631
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:41,408
Pacheco soda water they're also likely

632
00:30:41,664 --> 00:30:42,176
Troy

633
00:30:44,736 --> 00:30:46,784
Crave alcohol

634
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:47,808
Coffee

635
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:53,696
About it

636
00:30:54,464 --> 00:30:56,000
What what allows me to stop

637
00:31:04,448 --> 00:31:04,960
Wow

638
00:31:05,472 --> 00:31:07,008
But Evans on real

639
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:10,848
To take some supplements and Topo Chico on air

640
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:12,896
Somehow he just

641
00:31:13,152 --> 00:31:14,432
Defies deflects

642
00:31:14,688 --> 00:31:17,248
And avoids his alcoholism

643
00:31:17,504 --> 00:31:18,528
In-N-Out

644
00:31:18,784 --> 00:31:19,552
Pivot

645
00:31:19,808 --> 00:31:21,600
Selling one of his b*******

646
00:31:22,112 --> 00:31:24,928
Supplement this could be really big for the

647
00:31:25,184 --> 00:31:26,976
Dinner with the community of Alcoholics

648
00:31:27,232 --> 00:31:30,048
All they need is some Topo Chico and Alex

649
00:31:30,304 --> 00:31:34,144
This is a curb your addiction is a little bit like

650
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:34,912
Senegal

651
00:31:35,168 --> 00:31:41,312
I'm f****** intervention for an Avon salesman's alcoholism and then everybody leaves with Avon

652
00:31:41,568 --> 00:31:42,592
The person goes

653
00:31:46,176 --> 00:31:47,712
Metaphor

654
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:52,832
Complaints about stress

655
00:31:53,344 --> 00:31:53,856
Obviously

656
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:54,624
Caldwell

657
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,672
She said tax the rich and that's a

658
00:31:56,928 --> 00:32:00,000
Statement that could not be more fun again

659
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:04,096
But there's other there other celebrities that are doing the Lord's work

660
00:32:04,352 --> 00:32:04,864
Work that are doing

661
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:05,632
And far more

662
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:08,704
Nicki Minaj

663
00:32:09,472 --> 00:32:09,984
Oh God

664
00:32:18,432 --> 00:32:20,480
These these prions that the vaccine create

665
00:32:22,528 --> 00:32:25,344
So first of all Nicki Minaj's Queen had to do with our cousin's friend

666
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:28,672
Men's balls which were not trunk but allegedly became swollen

667
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:35,584
This friend allegedly lived in Trinidad and because Nicki Minaj has over 22 million followers on Twitter

668
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:40,192
Any sort two pieces of straight information can have serious ramifications on public opinion

669
00:32:40,448 --> 00:32:43,264
The health minister of Trinidad and Tobago came out and said the

670
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:44,288
This was not true

671
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:47,104
Terrence Dale senior quote

672
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:53,504
One of the reasons why we cannot respond yesterday in real time to miss Minaj is that we had to check and make sure that what

673
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,552
What you was claiming was either true or false

674
00:32:56,064 --> 00:33:00,160
Unfortunately we wasted so much time yesterday running down this false claim

675
00:33:03,232 --> 00:33:05,536
This story is one of those

676
00:33:05,792 --> 00:33:06,816
Few times are you like

677
00:33:07,072 --> 00:33:07,840
Oh that's right

678
00:33:08,096 --> 00:33:08,608
We rate

679
00:33:08,864 --> 00:33:10,400
We're not human being

680
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:15,776
We're just Apes we got to stop pretending that we are any different from a Capuchin

681
00:33:16,032 --> 00:33:20,896
Looking at the strongest member drive going over

682
00:33:21,408 --> 00:33:23,200
It was a bit of a bummer

683
00:33:23,456 --> 00:33:29,600
Kind of sad to see Alex running with this but I saw that Tucker was also running

684
00:33:32,672 --> 00:33:34,720
Nicki Minaj's cousin's friend

685
00:33:34,976 --> 00:33:35,744
I just

686
00:33:36,768 --> 00:33:39,072
I mean it's Saturday I think the Tucker covered it

687
00:33:39,328 --> 00:33:39,840
Cuz he's on TV

688
00:33:40,096 --> 00:33:41,632
Alex

689
00:33:41,888 --> 00:33:42,656
Like whatever

690
00:33:42,912 --> 00:33:45,216
He has no standards

691
00:33:45,728 --> 00:33:49,312
Tucker used to he should at least be pretending to be more seriously

692
00:33:49,568 --> 00:33:51,360
Somebody should have been added the

693
00:33:51,616 --> 00:33:52,896
Meeting being like week

694
00:33:53,408 --> 00:33:54,688
Tucker Carlson

695
00:33:54,944 --> 00:33:56,224
Talk about Nicki Minaj

696
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:58,016
Is fake friends cousin

697
00:33:58,272 --> 00:33:59,552
Balls cousin's friend

698
00:33:59,808 --> 00:34:01,600
Whatever we can't do this

699
00:34:01,856 --> 00:34:03,136
She's going to wear this can't happen

700
00:34:03,648 --> 00:34:06,976
And I no longer like super bass turns out

701
00:34:09,536 --> 00:34:10,560
Fat buddy going to do

702
00:34:10,816 --> 00:34:12,352
There are some side effects

703
00:34:12,864 --> 00:34:15,936
From the back saying that Alex is going to talk about very responsible

704
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:23,104
Reuters don't show these folks on Twitter hard inflammation ever coming 19 shots higher-than-expected

705
00:34:26,688 --> 00:34:27,968
Article from the end of

706
00:34:28,224 --> 00:34:30,528
Juno was originally reported on Riders

707
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:36,416
There's a study that was done they found a higher-than-expected rate of hard inflammation among vaccinated military members

708
00:34:37,184 --> 00:34:42,048
That's definitely concerned but also it's important to not let this be blown too far out of proportion

709
00:34:42,304 --> 00:34:48,192
That study involved 36,000 military members and there were only twenty-three cases of hardened

710
00:34:48,448 --> 00:34:53,568
Inflammation in the general population you'd expect eight cases among otherwise normally healthy

711
00:34:53,824 --> 00:34:54,336
Free People

712
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:55,360
Is it in Port

713
00:34:55,616 --> 00:34:56,384
Something for scientist

714
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:57,920
The track and learn more about butt

715
00:34:58,432 --> 00:35:00,736
Not the sort of red flag that Alex is trying to make it out to

716
00:35:01,504 --> 00:35:04,832
He also is completely making up that part about the mass deaths

717
00:35:05,088 --> 00:35:11,232
They're really 23 people in the study who had this inflammation and according to the very Reuters article that Alex is using as his prime

718
00:35:11,488 --> 00:35:12,000
Resource

719
00:35:12,256 --> 00:35:16,608
All of the patients had recovered or were recovering from myocarditis

720
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:17,888
And inflammation of the heart

721
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,424
He's just a total liar

722
00:35:20,192 --> 00:35:21,216
Jamaican bulshit up

723
00:35:21,472 --> 00:35:23,776
Yeah that sounds like you're right on the other hand

724
00:35:24,032 --> 00:35:24,544
And maybe

725
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:27,360
All of those military people are dead

726
00:35:27,616 --> 00:35:29,920
And have been cloned

727
00:35:30,432 --> 00:35:36,320
As we know that they can do with Joe Biden and or Jim Carrey's yeah I think it's this

728
00:35:36,832 --> 00:35:39,392
Still up in the air now the real question is how they balls

729
00:35:41,184 --> 00:35:44,512
I do love living in a world now where we're just

730
00:35:45,024 --> 00:35:46,816
We're just talking about balls on TV

731
00:35:47,072 --> 00:35:48,608
I grew up

732
00:35:48,864 --> 00:35:50,912
Bruno Home Improvement times

733
00:35:51,168 --> 00:35:55,776
Use eight euphemisms before they could even get to a joke about a dick while we're back on the

734
00:35:56,032 --> 00:35:56,544
The ball talk

735
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:02,944
Touchback on Survivor for a second every now and again like every other season.

736
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:06,784
So are you up to stand on like a little

737
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:07,552
Block

738
00:36:08,576 --> 00:36:09,088
Plate

739
00:36:09,344 --> 00:36:10,880
MMA ball on it

740
00:36:11,136 --> 00:36:16,000
They can roll off the balance

741
00:36:16,256 --> 00:36:18,048
Like a f****** survivor's a balance

742
00:36:18,304 --> 00:36:18,816
Some challenge

743
00:36:20,096 --> 00:36:20,608
Jeff Probst

744
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:22,400
Jeff Probst

745
00:36:22,656 --> 00:36:26,240
Goes way too far with the this person's balls are moving jokes

746
00:36:26,752 --> 00:36:27,776
It's incest

747
00:36:30,336 --> 00:36:36,480
He makes a meal out of it it almost like you can tell he's looking forward to that challenge so you can talk about people

748
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:42,880
Every year it's like listen I'm going to take the balls at

749
00:36:43,136 --> 00:36:46,976
And I'm going to run with it on the Run

750
00:36:47,488 --> 00:36:50,048
Buddy you got to get your balls and check

751
00:36:51,072 --> 00:36:51,840
Goddamn

752
00:36:52,096 --> 00:36:53,376
But never bad times map

753
00:36:53,632 --> 00:36:57,216
Never bedtime so Gaston this episode

754
00:36:57,472 --> 00:36:58,240
And

755
00:36:59,776 --> 00:37:00,288
I think

756
00:37:01,312 --> 00:37:04,128
If you actually are paying attention to the suffix and Alex

757
00:37:04,384 --> 00:37:05,664
Augusta Ave

758
00:37:06,176 --> 00:37:12,320
Alfie Oakes he's that guy who runs the mask free grocery store in Florida

759
00:37:16,928 --> 00:37:21,024
What are you doing anyway he's on and turns out he's a big fan of Mike lindell's

760
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,840
What what they've done it's a Sal lynskey

761
00:37:24,096 --> 00:37:25,376
Where are they

762
00:37:25,632 --> 00:37:27,936
Made my quindell seem like he's some kind of

763
00:37:28,192 --> 00:37:28,960
Tinfoil hat

764
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:34,848
Very much

765
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:35,872
Provable

766
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:36,640
But

767
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,456
To fly privately fly

768
00:37:39,968 --> 00:37:41,504
Legislator in

769
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:45,344
The Symposium and guess what nobody would do it they said

770
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:46,368
Spanish song

771
00:37:46,624 --> 00:37:48,928
It's too partisan I guess now the truth is to

772
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:51,488
Become too partisan that was them being polite

773
00:37:55,584 --> 00:37:58,400
I don't think anyone's making my Glendale look nuts

774
00:37:58,656 --> 00:37:59,936
He's doing that himself

775
00:38:00,192 --> 00:38:02,752
Is it is fun whenever they watch Mike Lindell

776
00:38:03,008 --> 00:38:03,776
In like a

777
00:38:04,544 --> 00:38:07,616
Neutral situation you know they don't have somebody like Alex

778
00:38:07,872 --> 00:38:10,432
Tucker talking over and being like

779
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:13,248
What's going on they just let him go

780
00:38:13,504 --> 00:38:16,320
And then the conservative see him the way we do

781
00:38:16,576 --> 00:38:18,624
And they're like well obviously somebody's doing this

782
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:19,392
If they have

783
00:38:21,696 --> 00:38:26,560
Conspiracy

784
00:38:26,816 --> 00:38:29,120
That I think he is that I'm watching right now

785
00:38:29,376 --> 00:38:32,704
Alright then that means that Alex and Tucker Carlson are both

786
00:38:33,472 --> 00:38:34,496
Absolutely f****** in

787
00:38:35,008 --> 00:38:36,544
Well it's Saul Alinsky

788
00:38:37,568 --> 00:38:38,336
Here's the deal

789
00:38:38,592 --> 00:38:40,128
Alex and these Folk

790
00:38:40,384 --> 00:38:40,896
I don't

791
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:42,176
Fox anchor actually watch

792
00:38:42,432 --> 00:38:43,712
Sing any uninterrupted

793
00:38:43,968 --> 00:38:45,760
Long chunks

794
00:38:46,016 --> 00:38:47,296
Of Mike Lindell trying to

795
00:38:47,552 --> 00:38:48,832
Explain

796
00:38:49,088 --> 00:38:50,624
You find out he was full of s*** right

797
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:53,184
Alex's on the payroll

798
00:38:54,464 --> 00:38:55,232
It's

799
00:38:55,488 --> 00:38:57,536
All bets are off with him

800
00:38:58,048 --> 00:38:59,840
And then other people are just getting like

801
00:39:00,096 --> 00:39:00,864
Glimpses of

802
00:39:01,376 --> 00:39:05,472
What is reported on like is symposium or these things in

803
00:39:05,728 --> 00:39:06,496
And yeah you can

804
00:39:06,752 --> 00:39:11,616
Choose to like okay if it's in the mainstream media at all must be in attack you must have actually said something real

805
00:39:12,128 --> 00:39:13,408
Yeah it's going on here

806
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,992
Also I have decided that I'm going

807
00:39:17,248 --> 00:39:19,296
To create something called the

808
00:39:19,552 --> 00:39:20,576
Lynn delameter

809
00:39:20,832 --> 00:39:22,880
And that is that if you

810
00:39:23,648 --> 00:39:24,160
It now

811
00:39:25,184 --> 00:39:26,208
Are supporting Mike Lindell

812
00:39:26,976 --> 00:39:29,024
You're on the payroll or your approval

813
00:39:31,584 --> 00:39:32,608
Okay that's that's

814
00:39:32,864 --> 00:39:39,008
Be the sort of line I like steak the Mendoza Line

815
00:39:39,264 --> 00:39:40,032
That's what separates

816
00:39:40,288 --> 00:39:46,432
You're a True Believer or getting paid right

817
00:39:46,688 --> 00:39:48,224
Anybody who can

818
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:50,784
Can think for themselves has left that train

819
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:51,808
If you do good

820
00:39:52,064 --> 00:39:53,088
That went away a long time ago

821
00:39:54,368 --> 00:39:55,904
Alfie's got a lot of

822
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:56,672
Employees

823
00:39:57,184 --> 00:39:58,464
For his store

824
00:40:00,256 --> 00:40:01,280
They're all on Ivermectin

825
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:03,840
But I mean like summer

826
00:40:04,096 --> 00:40:04,608
Itsec

827
00:40:04,864 --> 00:40:05,376
I like maybe

828
00:40:05,632 --> 00:40:08,960
But maybe a lot I don't know some of them might have gotten seriously sick

829
00:40:09,728 --> 00:40:10,496
Every single

830
00:40:13,312 --> 00:40:14,592
Over the last year-and-a-half

831
00:40:15,104 --> 00:40:17,152
We might have had 16 employees that

832
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:22,016
Enter back to work in 5 days

833
00:40:22,272 --> 00:40:26,624
3202 weeks

834
00:40:27,136 --> 00:40:33,280
Hospital

835
00:40:36,096 --> 00:40:36,864
Almost

836
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:43,264
The murdered in the hospital right back with Alby Hobbs responsible to report on what they would have done if your dad

837
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:48,896
Did something different done this they would have killed them

838
00:40:49,152 --> 00:40:49,920
Got sick

839
00:40:50,176 --> 00:40:51,200
From one of these

840
00:40:51,712 --> 00:40:55,808
Sick employees I mean it's not not possible

841
00:40:56,064 --> 00:40:58,624
But Noel so by the way she is doing

842
00:40:59,136 --> 00:41:01,952
No contact racing at all on these

843
00:41:02,208 --> 00:41:03,488
Thousands of people

844
00:41:03,744 --> 00:41:04,512
Who work there

845
00:41:04,768 --> 00:41:07,072
Who knows how many of them may have been

846
00:41:07,328 --> 00:41:08,864
Asymptomatic carrying it

847
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:10,912
You have a very good chance

848
00:41:11,168 --> 00:41:12,192
This is why do someday

849
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:17,568
I don't understand how

850
00:41:17,824 --> 00:41:18,592
These people

851
00:41:18,848 --> 00:41:20,640
Seem to think that they're making their case

852
00:41:20,896 --> 00:41:22,688
When is it like no you just

853
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:25,760
Are caring about the actual details of him

854
00:41:26,016 --> 00:41:32,160
I don't talk to them I make more money than them and then I fire them whatever they bother me and some of them

855
00:41:32,416 --> 00:41:33,696
Summer sick and some of them are

856
00:41:33,952 --> 00:41:34,720
What do I care

857
00:41:34,976 --> 00:41:35,744
The world is

858
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,536
Fine for me

859
00:41:38,048 --> 00:41:44,192
I don't know about like a people that they may have enacted or their grandparents

860
00:41:44,448 --> 00:41:47,520
His dad was sick one time but I didn't care about it

861
00:41:47,776 --> 00:41:50,848
Why do I care now please

862
00:41:51,104 --> 00:41:53,919
You might be asking yourself what's it all about Alfie

863
00:41:54,175 --> 00:41:58,015
I mean obviously it's the globalist trying to exterminate the human race

864
00:41:58,271 --> 00:42:01,343
He wanted to come on Alex's show cuz he has a very

865
00:42:03,647 --> 00:42:04,159
Rhonda saint

866
00:42:05,183 --> 00:42:05,695
Governor

867
00:42:05,951 --> 00:42:06,463
Florida

868
00:42:07,231 --> 00:42:08,255
Nightmare cycle

869
00:42:08,511 --> 00:42:09,535
Ronnie

870
00:42:10,047 --> 00:42:11,839
He's apparently coming to do

871
00:42:12,095 --> 00:42:13,119
Promotional

872
00:42:13,375 --> 00:42:15,935
Fundraising event at Alfie store he is

873
00:42:17,471 --> 00:42:18,751
Or 2 or something

874
00:42:19,007 --> 00:42:20,031
Alright alright

875
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:20,799
But

876
00:42:21,311 --> 00:42:24,639
Alfie needs an emergency meeting with Ron DeSantis

877
00:42:25,151 --> 00:42:25,663
Can't wait

878
00:42:25,919 --> 00:42:26,943
Until the in-store

879
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:28,991
It's Alex has been enlisted

880
00:42:29,503 --> 00:42:32,575
To try and get the audience to harass Ron DeSantis

881
00:42:34,367 --> 00:42:36,159
Got a plan he needs to talk

882
00:42:37,695 --> 00:42:38,975
Governor Ron DeSantis

883
00:42:39,999 --> 00:42:41,279
GOG

884
00:42:41,535 --> 00:42:42,303
MyFlorida

885

893
00:42:53,567 --> 00:42:54,591
Get the number to Santa to me

894
00:42:54,847 --> 00:42:57,663
Meet with Alby

895
00:42:58,175 --> 00:43:04,319
Wow I don't know another meeting why do you need to go on Alex's show and

896
00:43:04,575 --> 00:43:05,087
It almost send

897
00:43:07,903 --> 00:43:08,927
Also I think

898
00:43:09,183 --> 00:43:11,743
I don't know a whole lot about campaign Finance

899
00:43:13,279 --> 00:43:14,047
Total expert in the

900
00:43:14,303 --> 00:43:14,815
This seems

901
00:43:15,071 --> 00:43:19,167
Dicey

902
00:43:19,679 --> 00:43:22,495
What do people do when they call these numbers or go to this website what do they do

903
00:43:24,543 --> 00:43:27,359
If there's a way to put

904
00:43:27,871 --> 00:43:31,967
Email cross the screen I'm begging every person that watches did you send him an email

905
00:43:32,479 --> 00:43:34,015
If they have this meeting with Alfie

906
00:43:35,295 --> 00:43:36,831
I'm going to make a huge cock

907
00:43:37,087 --> 00:43:39,391
Contribution weather at the end of the meeting

908
00:43:39,647 --> 00:43:40,671
Decides

909
00:43:41,183 --> 00:43:41,695
2

910
00:43:42,207 --> 00:43:46,815
You know to believe what we say but all I want is two hours with the experts they're going to be with me

911
00:43:47,327 --> 00:43:48,607
Because he's a smart man

912
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:51,679
After 2 hours I believe that he'll realize

913
00:43:51,935 --> 00:43:54,239
The amount of fraud that happened even here in Florida

914
00:43:54,495 --> 00:43:57,567
And that he's boarded-up he's the one man that is bold enough

915
00:43:57,823 --> 00:44:01,407
In history will be talkin about Ron DeSantis

916
00:44:01,663 --> 00:44:04,223
200 years ago like like we are founding fathers

917
00:44:04,479 --> 00:44:04,991
Receiving

918
00:44:05,247 --> 00:44:06,271
Republic

919
00:44:06,527 --> 00:44:07,039
Yikes

920
00:44:07,295 --> 00:44:13,439
Let's put the clock up countdown to 12 santosuossos going to cancel that event

921
00:44:13,695 --> 00:44:15,999
That's the first clock

922
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:17,791
Yeah

923
00:44:18,047 --> 00:44:22,655
I mean I know that there's a bit of back scratching that goes on in the world of Chihuahua picture

924
00:44:22,911 --> 00:44:25,727
Think if the register to be like

925
00:44:27,775 --> 00:44:28,543
What's it called evil

926
00:44:28,799 --> 00:44:29,311
No

927
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:30,591
A lobbyist

928
00:44:30,847 --> 00:44:31,359
That's it

929
00:44:31,871 --> 00:44:33,663
I don't think I said different things

930
00:44:36,223 --> 00:44:40,319
Yeah I think you have to register to be a lobbyist which is kind of what he seems you doing

931
00:44:40,575 --> 00:44:43,647
It's that thing that on also if you're if you're a foreign lobbyist

932
00:44:43,903 --> 00:44:50,047
Just for like a different country you have to register it that thing that most of our Congress without registering

933
00:44:50,815 --> 00:44:51,583
Speaking of that

934
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:55,679
Michael Flynn is also working with Alfie he's going to be in that meeting

935
00:44:55,935 --> 00:44:57,727
If he gets with Ron DeSantis

936
00:44:59,775 --> 00:45:01,055
Yeah I love it

937
00:45:01,567 --> 00:45:02,335
I love it

938
00:45:02,591 --> 00:45:07,967
Find this confusing

939
00:45:08,223 --> 00:45:13,855
I find this very confusing because we have a situation where Alfie ostensibly is like really good friends

940
00:45:14,879 --> 00:45:15,391
Doesn't

941
00:45:21,023 --> 00:45:22,047
At the same time

942
00:45:22,815 --> 00:45:26,655
Yvette is really important thing you need to tell him there's no other way for this to happen

943
00:45:26,911 --> 00:45:30,239
Then for him to go on Infowars and have the audience

944
00:45:30,495 --> 00:45:31,263
Harass

945
00:45:31,519 --> 00:45:33,055
DeSantis is office

946
00:45:33,311 --> 00:45:35,615
I'm going to I'm just going to go out and say it the

947
00:45:35,871 --> 00:45:37,151
The way that I've always

948
00:45:37,407 --> 00:45:39,199
Successfully lobbied

949
00:45:41,247 --> 00:45:44,831
Going on at weird show and telling people to send s*** tons of

950
00:45:45,087 --> 00:45:47,647
Emails this is the behavior of someone who

951
00:45:47,903 --> 00:45:48,671
I feel dumb

952
00:45:48,927 --> 00:45:50,719
Don't have much access

953
00:45:51,743 --> 00:45:55,071
But I could be wrong if you have to say the quiet part loud and just be like

954
00:45:55,327 --> 00:45:57,119
I'm going to give you money

955
00:45:57,375 --> 00:45:58,655
Yeah talk to me

956
00:45:59,679 --> 00:46:01,983
That's the idea

957
00:46:02,239 --> 00:46:06,079
Wink it's not conditional on you believe in God

958
00:46:07,103 --> 00:46:08,127
This money

959
00:46:08,383 --> 00:46:11,199
Free money I just need to speak to you very quick

960
00:46:11,455 --> 00:46:14,271
You will be the room for a few hours

961
00:46:15,295 --> 00:46:19,391
Now if you sit through the whole 2 hours

962
00:46:19,647 --> 00:46:25,023
You will get a free bottle of tequila and a two-day three-night stay at the timeshare

963
00:46:25,279 --> 00:46:25,791
Talking thing

964
00:46:26,047 --> 00:46:28,095
Yeah anyway what Alfie needs

965
00:46:28,351 --> 00:46:29,119
Is Vicki

966
00:46:29,375 --> 00:46:29,887
He needs

967
00:46:30,143 --> 00:46:31,423
The scientists stand up

968
00:46:32,191 --> 00:46:33,215
Because then we can overturn

969
00:46:33,471 --> 00:46:34,751
The 2020 election or something

970
00:46:35,263 --> 00:46:37,055
We can prove fraud or something sure

971
00:46:37,311 --> 00:46:37,823
I mean

972
00:46:38,591 --> 00:46:41,151
A lot of time with Michael and I happen to believe

973
00:46:41,407 --> 00:46:43,199
Most of everything that he saying

974
00:46:45,503 --> 00:46:47,039
At least let one stay

975
00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:49,855
Verify okay

976
00:46:50,111 --> 00:46:54,207
Nobody's everyone's running the other way because they like I said we've done the Salton Sea

977
00:46:54,463 --> 00:46:56,767
Tacticon Mike Lindell to make him seem crazy

978
00:46:57,023 --> 00:46:58,303
No one's done any

979
00:46:58,559 --> 00:46:59,327
Tactics

980
00:46:59,583 --> 00:47:04,447
That's what he's basically doing here is demanding people proven negative

981
00:47:04,959 --> 00:47:05,983
So you want to stay

982
00:47:06,239 --> 00:47:09,823
To prove that there was no fraud and that'll satisfy

983
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:13,919
Google what's Mike lindell's so crazy then why won't some stuff

984
00:47:14,175 --> 00:47:15,967
Completely prune negative

985
00:47:16,479 --> 00:47:17,503
That's a losing game

986
00:47:17,759 --> 00:47:20,319
And even if some state were to somehow

987
00:47:20,575 --> 00:47:23,903
Forensically prove literally every vote was

988
00:47:24,159 --> 00:47:25,695
Was perfect and wonderful

989
00:47:25,951 --> 00:47:32,095
Well yeah that's the one state that they had everything run smoothly and in order to serve as a distraction from the other

990
00:47:32,351 --> 00:47:33,119
States with that with that

991
00:47:33,887 --> 00:47:40,031
Goalpost would just move that nonsense every time it's not

992
00:47:40,799 --> 00:47:46,943
Anybody should take seriously the real argument is had the moment he said I believe most of everything Mike lindell's

993
00:47:47,199 --> 00:47:48,479
Elsa and you said wait most of

994
00:47:48,735 --> 00:47:54,623
Why is your first instinct most parks

995
00:47:54,879 --> 00:48:01,023
Yeah what is Mike Lindell saying that even you don't believe me

996
00:48:01,279 --> 00:48:04,607
You said most of you were just trying to sound saying haha

997
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:06,143
So Alex

998
00:48:06,399 --> 00:48:11,519
Gets back to his army vaccine study story that he is continuing to fraudulently report

999
00:48:12,031 --> 00:48:18,175
I've got a Reuters study here Reuters article about the Pentagon

1000
00:48:18,687 --> 00:48:20,735
Over a million truths

1001
00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:28,671
Swelling

1002
00:48:31,743 --> 00:48:33,279
This is Josef Mengele

1003
00:48:33,791 --> 00:48:35,071
We Are The Twilight Zone here

1004
00:48:39,423 --> 00:48:43,775
Again that is a lie about a article from the end of June

1005
00:48:44,031 --> 00:48:44,543
Yeah

1006
00:48:46,335 --> 00:48:47,359
The great reset is here

1007
00:48:48,127 --> 00:48:48,639
Alright

1008
00:48:48,895 --> 00:48:55,039
Shut up shut the f****** shut the fuk up I see that face I see that look on

1009
00:48:55,295 --> 00:48:56,319
Your face that says

1010
00:49:00,159 --> 00:49:01,951
Non-sequitur your way out of that

1011
00:49:02,207 --> 00:49:03,743
That's near the Great

1012
00:49:03,999 --> 00:49:07,327
Gregory set the roof

1013
00:49:07,583 --> 00:49:08,351
Any proof

1014
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:13,983
I don't know you're laughing either give me that look that I was well

1015
00:49:14,495 --> 00:49:19,615
I happen to have fur

1016
00:49:19,871 --> 00:49:21,663
Air filtration supplement

1017
00:49:22,687 --> 00:49:25,503
To the textiles are still plenty of

1018
00:49:30,111 --> 00:49:31,391
Back in February

1019
00:49:32,927 --> 00:49:34,719
Broken

1020
00:49:35,743 --> 00:49:37,023
Problem

1021
00:49:37,535 --> 00:49:38,815
The pool heater broke

1022
00:49:43,423 --> 00:49:43,935
Broke

1023
00:49:44,959 --> 00:49:49,055
Flooded it it's all wrong I'm trying to sell my house

1024
00:49:51,615 --> 00:49:53,151
Wigs and no one has

1025
00:49:57,247 --> 00:49:58,271
Close to it

1026
00:50:04,159 --> 00:50:07,999
All breaking down the great reset

1027
00:50:08,511 --> 00:50:09,279
Yeah see proof

1028
00:50:09,791 --> 00:50:11,327
Alex can't fix his pool

1029
00:50:13,375 --> 00:50:17,727
If you can't get

1030
00:50:18,239 --> 00:50:19,775
You know the countries broken down

1031
00:50:20,031 --> 00:50:24,127
I also guarantee you cut do you know who's the last person to say that was

1032
00:50:24,383 --> 00:50:28,991
F****** Mero buddy that's how you know that the truth is being

1033
00:50:29,247 --> 00:50:34,111
Unspoken it's Alex and Nero the only two people

1034
00:50:34,367 --> 00:50:37,439
When they needed pool tiles in the whole country

1035
00:50:37,695 --> 00:50:39,999
We will always remember when class Schwab

1036
00:50:40,255 --> 00:50:43,583
Fiddled while Alex's pool went unfix

1037
00:50:47,423 --> 00:50:49,983
F****** I mean

1038
00:50:50,495 --> 00:50:54,335
Look at that white people problems we've moved on from that mean but God

1039
00:50:54,591 --> 00:50:55,615
Damn bitching about

1040
00:50:55,871 --> 00:50:58,431
Pool tile is about as close as it gets to

1041
00:50:58,687 --> 00:51:02,527
I've found a number of places you can buy a pool tiles

1042
00:51:04,831 --> 00:51:10,719
You can get overnight I was going to record a phone call with a

1043
00:51:11,999 --> 00:51:16,607
Will a Line in the Sand what we can put up with what we can

1044
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:17,631
Sure

1045
00:51:17,887 --> 00:51:18,655
That's that's

1046
00:51:19,167 --> 00:51:19,679
Normal

1047
00:51:19,935 --> 00:51:20,703
I suppose

1048
00:51:20,959 --> 00:51:21,727
Alfie

1049
00:51:21,983 --> 00:51:23,519
You have a Line in the Sand

1050
00:51:24,287 --> 00:51:26,079
Unfortunately this sand

1051
00:51:26,335 --> 00:51:26,847
Is the

1052
00:51:27,359 --> 00:51:29,151
Murdering other p

1053
00:51:29,407 --> 00:51:29,919
People sand

1054
00:51:30,431 --> 00:51:31,967
The line

1055
00:51:32,223 --> 00:51:35,551
You know where it's okay to start murdering other people already in the sand

1056
00:51:36,575 --> 00:51:40,415
It's coming still but it's there is a specific line

1057
00:51:40,671 --> 00:51:41,695
And it's fast approaching

1058
00:51:42,463 --> 00:51:43,999
If we don't stop this if it

1059
00:51:44,255 --> 00:51:45,535
The one in the sand

1060
00:51:45,791 --> 00:51:51,423
Is 20-22 if they steal if they are successful in stealing the 2022 election it's only a year

1061
00:51:53,983 --> 00:51:57,311
It's game over it's going time there's not going to be talking to anymore

1062
00:51:57,567 --> 00:51:59,103
Handshakes and Pen deals

1063
00:51:59,359 --> 00:52:00,383
It's going to be it's going to be

1064
00:52:00,639 --> 00:52:03,199
I don't want that to happen I'm not one of these guys

1065
00:52:03,455 --> 00:52:09,599
I want to stop at before albino outside the Constitution said everybody was $600

1066
00:52:09,855 --> 00:52:13,439
Fourth Amendment

1067
00:52:15,487 --> 00:52:16,511
It's a little bit

1068
00:52:16,767 --> 00:52:18,047
Off the beaten path Road

1069
00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:19,071
I'll be saying it

1070
00:52:19,327 --> 00:52:20,607
It's gun time yeah

1071
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:22,911
That's that's intense

1072
00:52:23,167 --> 00:52:26,239
You know if you're if you're the type of person who doesn't want

1073
00:52:26,751 --> 00:52:27,775
To use gun

1074
00:52:28,031 --> 00:52:29,311
Then why does it

1075
00:52:29,567 --> 00:52:30,079
It seemed like

1076
00:52:30,335 --> 00:52:33,919
Your solution to every time you don't get what you want is gone

1077
00:52:34,431 --> 00:52:40,575
And it's a constant like whenever you're not getting your way at the concert if I don't get my way soon it will be gone bad

1078
00:52:43,391 --> 00:52:44,415
Time

1079
00:52:44,671 --> 00:52:45,695
Yeah it kind of

1080
00:52:45,951 --> 00:52:49,279
It kind of makes me feel like maybe you're not being very sincere about not wanting

1081
00:52:49,535 --> 00:52:51,839
It's begun time you kind of just one

1082
00:52:52,095 --> 00:52:52,607
Begun time

1083
00:52:52,863 --> 00:52:54,655
Waiting for everyone else

1084
00:52:54,911 --> 00:52:55,935
To give you the permission

1085
00:52:56,191 --> 00:52:59,007
To do what you know is morally wrong

1086
00:53:00,287 --> 00:53:03,359
So Alfie takes off he's got two more

1087
00:53:03,615 --> 00:53:05,151
Employees to put at risk

1088
00:53:05,407 --> 00:53:07,199
So he can't tell stay on the phone all day

1089
00:53:07,711 --> 00:53:09,247
News

1090
00:53:09,503 --> 00:53:11,807
Is this this little nugget about General milley

1091
00:53:12,319 --> 00:53:13,599
How is a traitor

1092
00:53:13,855 --> 00:53:18,719
But wow Moore's coming out turns out was A5 I one of the quote on Alliance Nations it picked

1093
00:53:20,511 --> 00:53:22,303
Sing

1094
00:53:24,351 --> 00:53:26,911
Whatever you do will call you will weigh

1095
00:53:27,167 --> 00:53:28,959
Launch nuclear weapons at us whatever

1096
00:53:29,471 --> 00:53:30,751
This is so insane

1097
00:53:36,895 --> 00:53:37,407
Peebles

1098
00:53:37,919 --> 00:53:39,199
Military over their leadership

1099
00:53:39,711 --> 00:53:40,991
And resulted in a

1100
00:53:41,247 --> 00:53:41,759
5i

1101
00:53:42,271 --> 00:53:44,063
Rocket of what the f

1102
00:53:48,159 --> 00:53:51,487
I don't know all the details of everything that was discussed

1103
00:53:51,743 --> 00:53:57,887
Between General million is CounterPoint

1104
00:53:58,143 --> 00:53:59,167
Is kind of silly

1105
00:54:03,263 --> 00:54:09,407
Go Dukas lysing the story

1106
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:10,943
I'm not a full expert on

1107
00:54:11,455 --> 00:54:17,599
These kinds of issues but I can kind of see how that might be a really inappropriate thing for him to have done

1108
00:54:17,855 --> 00:54:21,695
You know in terms of chain-of-command I can see that being

1109
00:54:22,719 --> 00:54:23,231
Kind of

1110
00:54:23,487 --> 00:54:25,279
Could get in trouble for sure

1111
00:54:25,791 --> 00:54:26,559
At the same time

1112
00:54:26,815 --> 00:54:29,887
I was alive then and I remember how

1113
00:54:30,399 --> 00:54:30,911
Belligerent

1114
00:54:31,167 --> 00:54:32,191
Trump was being

1115
00:54:32,447 --> 00:54:33,983
The idea of

1116
00:54:35,007 --> 00:54:36,799
Engaging in a little bit of diplomacy

1117
00:54:38,335 --> 00:54:39,615
Maybe maybe

1118
00:54:39,871 --> 00:54:41,151
McDonald Longway

1119
00:54:41,407 --> 00:54:42,175
I mean there's

1120
00:54:42,431 --> 00:54:43,455
That and then there's

1121
00:54:43,711 --> 00:54:44,991
Is Jaime Lannister's way

1122
00:54:46,015 --> 00:54:46,783
So like

1123
00:54:47,807 --> 00:54:49,343
I've I mean I I suppose

1124
00:54:49,599 --> 00:54:50,367
It's better that he

1125
00:54:50,623 --> 00:54:52,159
Just made a phone call instead of

1126
00:54:52,415 --> 00:54:54,207
Stabbing the Mad King as though

1127
00:54:54,719 --> 00:54:55,231
Brownsburg

1128
00:54:55,487 --> 00:55:01,631
I think there was a better way maybe well icing

1129
00:55:01,887 --> 00:55:04,959
His favor is you know this was an act that was meant

1130
00:55:05,215 --> 00:55:05,727
2

1131
00:55:05,983 --> 00:55:06,751
Encourage stability

1132
00:55:07,007 --> 00:55:09,055
And to reinforce

1133
00:55:09,311 --> 00:55:10,335
To China that

1134
00:55:10,591 --> 00:55:11,871
There is stability

1135
00:55:12,127 --> 00:55:12,639
You know like

1136
00:55:13,151 --> 00:55:19,295
This rhetoric is not nothing we're not going to do nuts yet we're not going to war with you

1137
00:55:19,551 --> 00:55:25,695
Like a reasonable phone call you would make to a friend Elena stairway would not

1138
00:55:25,951 --> 00:55:31,327
Encourage stability would work against the goals that Millions have for their

1139
00:55:32,351 --> 00:55:35,935
So Alex keeps hitting on this Army study

1140
00:55:36,191 --> 00:55:36,703
He keeps missing

1141
00:55:36,959 --> 00:55:37,471
Reporting it

1142
00:55:49,759 --> 00:55:53,343
Don't let this be you talk about your sister or brother or you

1143
00:56:00,511 --> 00:56:02,303
Everybody

1144
00:56:02,815 --> 00:56:04,607
Allexa cannot

1145
00:56:04,863 --> 00:56:07,423
Deal with this Army study accurately

1146
00:56:07,679 --> 00:56:08,703
Nighteye

1147
00:56:08,959 --> 00:56:09,471
Can't do it

1148
00:56:09,727 --> 00:56:12,031
I feel like he's playing with fire there just because

1149
00:56:12,543 --> 00:56:14,335
The military is going to be fine

1150
00:56:15,103 --> 00:56:16,639
And they're not going anywhere

1151
00:56:16,895 --> 00:56:18,175
So it's hard to like

1152
00:56:18,431 --> 00:56:19,455
Maintain.

1153
00:56:19,711 --> 00:56:21,247
What story do you know what I mean like

1154
00:56:21,503 --> 00:56:22,527
I guess

1155
00:56:22,783 --> 00:56:28,671
It's not going to be able to continue and I have people like 2,000 for that they were all getting chipped

1156
00:56:28,927 --> 00:56:29,951
That's fair

1157
00:56:30,975 --> 00:56:37,119
The stakes are low that's fair I was just Thinkin o if you're going to say that the military is all going to die

1158
00:56:37,375 --> 00:56:39,167
Is your I imagine your audience has

1159
00:56:39,423 --> 00:56:40,191
At least some

1160
00:56:40,703 --> 00:56:43,007
I mean I would I would think demographically

1161
00:56:43,519 --> 00:56:44,799
Alex is audience would have

1162
00:56:45,055 --> 00:56:47,103
Fewer Degrees of Separation

1163
00:56:47,359 --> 00:56:48,639
In from military members

1164
00:56:48,895 --> 00:56:52,735
You know what I'm saying like I don't know anybody personally but I imagine that they

1165
00:56:54,015 --> 00:57:00,159
Closer table to example

1166
00:57:00,415 --> 00:57:02,463
A military person would like be like right now

1167
00:57:05,279 --> 00:57:06,047
Bears

1168
00:57:06,303 --> 00:57:07,583
Alex has a pool to fix

1169
00:57:09,119 --> 00:57:10,399
Fair enough

1170
00:57:10,655 --> 00:57:12,447
Alex's Mister police state

1171
00:57:12,703 --> 00:57:13,983
Police state

1172
00:57:14,239 --> 00:57:15,007
Hate hate

1173
00:57:19,615 --> 00:57:20,127
Police state

1174
00:57:20,383 --> 00:57:23,455
Play 2000 have graded was it apart at least eight

1175
00:57:23,711 --> 00:57:24,223
4

1176
00:57:24,479 --> 00:57:27,551
Rise of the Machines

1177
00:57:28,575 --> 00:57:33,695
He's made a lot of films

1178
00:57:33,951 --> 00:57:35,743
The biggest things that he would yell about is

1179
00:57:35,999 --> 00:57:36,511
Is the police state

1180
00:57:37,791 --> 00:57:39,327
Courtney know his entire career

1181
00:57:40,095 --> 00:57:41,375
That makes me

1182
00:57:41,631 --> 00:57:42,399
Think that

1183
00:57:42,655 --> 00:57:46,751
He's the kind of person who would be in favor of body cams on police

1184
00:57:47,007 --> 00:57:48,543
Because it wouldn't

1185
00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:52,127
Accountability for the police state in order to make sure that they don't go over

1186
00:57:52,639 --> 00:57:58,783
Because it seems like one of the only ways that you could make sure there was accountability is if there were ways

1187
00:57:59,039 --> 00:58:00,063
Is 2nd

1188
00:58:00,319 --> 00:58:01,855
Viewing wow

1189
00:58:02,111 --> 00:58:02,623
But guess what

1190
00:58:02,879 --> 00:58:03,391
What

1191
00:58:06,207 --> 00:58:06,975
Body cams

1192
00:58:07,231 --> 00:58:08,511
Discretion

1193
00:58:10,815 --> 00:58:12,607
Good folks

1194
00:58:12,863 --> 00:58:13,375
No they're not

1195
00:58:13,887 --> 00:58:15,423
The enemy uses

1196
00:58:23,615 --> 00:58:24,127
Okay

1197
00:58:26,175 --> 00:58:26,687
You mean everything

1198
00:58:28,223 --> 00:58:31,551
I don't even know I swear I don't think these people know what they support

1199
00:58:32,063 --> 00:58:33,343
Today

1200
00:58:33,599 --> 00:58:39,743
The day-to-day Thin Blue Line police are the most important people in the world flags

1201
00:58:39,999 --> 00:58:40,511
Next day

1202
00:58:40,767 --> 00:58:43,327
Tapas says that a right-winger did something

1203
00:58:46,399 --> 00:58:48,959
Is sjw cops

1204
00:58:49,215 --> 00:58:50,495
Murder a protester

1205
00:58:50,751 --> 00:58:56,895
Baby Topsy Turvy protect we need to support them if you fire this person we will riot

1206
00:58:57,407 --> 00:58:59,199
Cops arrest a sovereign citizen

1207
00:59:03,295 --> 00:59:04,319
My God

1208
00:59:04,575 --> 00:59:06,623
It seems it seems very

1209
00:59:06,879 --> 00:59:09,695
Bizarre to me like

1210
00:59:09,951 --> 00:59:10,975
Kind of discretion

1211
00:59:11,743 --> 00:59:13,279
They were talking about here

1212
00:59:13,535 --> 00:59:16,863
Body cams would be relevant in terms of is not like

1213
00:59:17,119 --> 00:59:18,399
Whether you get a ticket or not

1214
00:59:19,679 --> 00:59:23,007
Is never going to be the subject of a body camera view

1215
00:59:23,263 --> 00:59:24,543
It's killing people

1216
00:59:25,567 --> 00:59:27,103
Important

1217
00:59:27,871 --> 00:59:28,895
It's wet

1218
00:59:29,407 --> 00:59:34,271
I don't know I think this is really dumb. There's just the story going around on Twitter today

1219
00:59:34,527 --> 00:59:36,319
Showing the the like

1220
00:59:37,343 --> 00:59:41,951
I believe she won a like three million dollar judgment or something against the cops

1221
00:59:42,207 --> 00:59:43,231
Because they

1222
00:59:43,487 --> 00:59:44,511
Brits are out of her car

1223
00:59:45,023 --> 00:59:47,583
Grab their child and then did a photo op with her

1224
00:59:47,839 --> 00:59:48,351
Right

1225
00:59:48,607 --> 00:59:49,631
And somebody was just

1226
00:59:49,887 --> 00:59:51,167
Juxtaposing that

1227
00:59:51,423 --> 00:59:51,935
Story

1228
00:59:52,191 --> 00:59:55,519
With the immediate aftermath that the LA Times put out

1229
00:59:55,775 --> 00:59:57,311
Whoever it was

1230
00:59:57,567 --> 00:59:59,871
With that picture of them doing the photo op like

1231
01:00:00,127 --> 01:00:04,223
Hero cop save everybody a mediately juxtaposed with three years later

1232
01:00:04,991 --> 01:00:06,271
3 million-dollar judgement against

1233
01:00:06,527 --> 01:00:10,367
The cops being evil nobody's going

1234
01:00:10,623 --> 01:00:11,647
Like fuk all of these people

1235
01:00:13,183 --> 01:00:13,951
Because yeah

1236
01:00:14,207 --> 01:00:14,719
Bucked up

1237
01:00:17,023 --> 01:00:17,791
We do anybody

1238
01:00:18,303 --> 01:00:18,815
But

1239
01:00:19,583 --> 01:00:20,351
In Canada

1240
01:00:21,119 --> 01:00:21,631
There's terrible news

1241
01:00:22,911 --> 01:00:23,679
Covid restrictions

1242
01:00:24,703 --> 01:00:25,215
Control

1243
01:00:25,983 --> 01:00:26,495
The Walmart

1244
01:00:27,007 --> 01:00:27,519
Once

1245
01:00:27,775 --> 01:00:28,287
Sacred

1246
01:00:30,335 --> 01:00:31,103
Tim Hortons

1247
01:00:31,615 --> 01:00:32,127
Right

1248
01:00:33,151 --> 01:00:33,663
Now

1249
01:00:34,431 --> 01:00:37,503
You need a vaccine to enter

1250
01:00:38,015 --> 01:00:40,063
There's another one

1251
01:00:40,575 --> 01:00:41,599
Walmart

1252
01:00:45,183 --> 01:00:46,719
2021

1253
01:00:50,815 --> 01:00:52,351
Walmart

1254
01:01:03,615 --> 01:01:05,919
So that thing that Alex's reading isn't real

1255
01:01:06,175 --> 01:01:07,199
That was a hoax

1256
01:01:07,455 --> 01:01:09,503
Facebook post that was going around the claim

1257
01:01:09,759 --> 01:01:15,903
Do you need proof of vaccination order shop at Walmarts in Canada

1258
01:01:16,159 --> 01:01:19,231
They would realize that their bread-and-butter is

1259
01:01:19,743 --> 01:01:20,255
Peopleshare

1260
01:01:20,767 --> 01:01:21,791
Totally not fake

1261
01:01:22,047 --> 01:01:24,863
I totally totally worth reporting

1262
01:01:25,119 --> 01:01:28,703
Yes. I reached out to Walmart instead quote customers do not have to

1263
01:01:28,959 --> 01:01:31,007
To show proof of vaccinations to shop at our stores

1264
01:01:31,263 --> 01:01:34,079
We continue to work with governments across the country and are following

1265
01:01:34,335 --> 01:01:34,847
Required

1266
01:01:35,871 --> 01:01:41,759
Even the official verified Walmart Canada Twitter account posted that this mean that was going around was not real

1267
01:01:42,527 --> 01:01:48,671
The standard of evidence or something that Alex is going to report on air is proof of the mark of the beast being upon us is just something he saw in

1268
01:01:48,927 --> 01:01:49,951
Random hoax face

1269
01:01:50,975 --> 01:01:51,743
This is pathetic

1270
01:01:51,999 --> 01:01:53,279
The level of work he's doing it

1271
01:01:54,559 --> 01:01:55,071
I mean

1272
01:01:55,839 --> 01:01:58,911
At least at least with the court of Heaven you can laugh

1273
01:01:59,167 --> 01:02:01,983
Real hard at the just

1274
01:02:02,239 --> 01:02:03,775
It's nonsensical

1275
01:02:04,031 --> 01:02:05,311
Felix's just doing a

1276
01:02:05,567 --> 01:02:07,615
Same difference I saw it

1277
01:02:07,871 --> 01:02:09,919
I got a chain email let me report on

1278
01:02:10,431 --> 01:02:12,991
I do like the image of

1279
01:02:13,759 --> 01:02:14,271
My

1280
01:02:14,527 --> 01:02:15,295
My

1281
01:02:15,807 --> 01:02:17,599
When I was growing up that Walmart greeter

1282
01:02:20,671 --> 01:02:22,463
Nice little old woman 5 ft 2

1283
01:02:22,719 --> 01:02:23,231
Ish

1284
01:02:23,743 --> 01:02:26,559
Just really should just shambling around with the

1285
01:02:26,815 --> 01:02:28,351
The car it's not really doing

1286
01:02:28,607 --> 01:02:30,399
I imagine her now

1287
01:02:30,911 --> 01:02:32,959
Happened to stay at the Gateway Bay like

1288
01:02:33,727 --> 01:02:37,055
Can I have proof of vaccination before you enter and

1289
01:02:37,311 --> 01:02:40,127
How long would you survive that long

1290
01:02:40,383 --> 01:02:43,711
Because they were killed and replaced with a

1291
01:02:44,735 --> 01:02:46,015
Sagano know that would work

1292
01:02:46,271 --> 01:02:49,087
Yeah that's how we do it that would

1293
01:02:49,343 --> 01:02:51,391
I mean this was a hoax Facebook

1294
01:02:51,647 --> 01:02:53,695
Proposed that Alex was real

1295
01:02:53,951 --> 01:02:58,559
Was pretending was real in order for him to use it as fodder for his reporting

1296
01:02:59,071 --> 01:03:00,863
He doesn't do much better with his neck story

1297
01:03:21,855 --> 01:03:22,367
What

1298
01:03:26,463 --> 01:03:29,279
P52 Mustang or whatever it is you're pulling trigger

1299
01:03:34,655 --> 01:03:37,215
Hospital

1300
01:03:40,543 --> 01:03:41,311
Mongolia

1301
01:03:46,175 --> 01:03:47,199
Red

1302
01:03:47,455 --> 01:03:49,247
Covid-19 graph

1303
01:03:49,759 --> 01:03:50,783
Play start the shots

1304
01:03:54,111 --> 01:03:54,879
2 weeks later

1305
01:03:59,743 --> 01:04:02,047
This is from the UN from John Hopkins from a mall

1306
01:04:02,303 --> 01:04:03,327
Oh it's so amazing

1307
01:04:03,839 --> 01:04:07,167
Is reporting based on a grassy found on a random

1308
01:04:07,423 --> 01:04:08,959
A person's Twitter account

1309
01:04:09,215 --> 01:04:09,727
In the video

1310
01:04:09,983 --> 01:04:15,359
On the overhead camera that Alex is using you can literally see that he just has a printout of this dude's Queen

1311
01:04:15,871 --> 01:04:16,895
He has done no work

1312
01:04:17,151 --> 01:04:17,663
Past that

1313
01:04:17,919 --> 01:04:20,735
It's just a Twitter account to the guy's name is Seguin on Weiss

1314
01:04:20,991 --> 01:04:22,271
Oh well I mean I try

1315
01:04:22,527 --> 01:04:23,295
Rusty Edelweiss

1316
01:04:24,575 --> 01:04:25,087
Itself it's just

1317
01:04:25,343 --> 01:04:26,367
Statistical misrepresentation

1318
01:04:26,879 --> 01:04:33,023
Notice anywhere as those statistics would look at that chip twice and it's enough for Alex to report his bombshell info on his show

1319
01:04:33,535 --> 01:04:34,047
Like

1320
01:04:34,303 --> 01:04:35,839
I can't stress this enough he shows f***

1321
01:04:36,095 --> 01:04:38,143
Looking pathetic like this is the kind of thing

1322
01:04:38,399 --> 01:04:40,959
That he he takes as like all I got it

1323
01:04:41,215 --> 01:04:43,519
Get this on are the people must know about this tweet

1324
01:04:44,031 --> 01:04:45,055
Like he might as well just

1325
01:04:45,311 --> 01:04:46,847
Be doing a Roundup shows like

1326
01:04:47,359 --> 01:04:50,943
Stupid s*** his friends found on social media passed along to him

1327
01:04:51,199 --> 01:04:55,039
That Inspire ramps

1328
01:04:55,807 --> 01:05:01,951
Yeah but with more is the devil

1329
01:05:02,207 --> 01:05:03,743
Cliff Tompkins

1330
01:05:03,999 --> 01:05:05,279
Racist

1331
01:05:05,535 --> 01:05:06,047
Yeah

1332
01:05:07,071 --> 01:05:13,215
And I'm looking at this grass that he found on Twitter he's just blown away

1333
01:05:17,055 --> 01:05:18,847
Numbers

1334
01:05:19,359 --> 01:05:21,663
Read text

1335
01:05:24,223 --> 01:05:27,295
So the reason the numbers me is because the person who made this graph

1336
01:05:27,551 --> 01:05:30,367
Specifically designed the scale of the two lions so they would

1337
01:05:32,159 --> 01:05:38,303
Each space on the scale of the total vaccinations lines representative of 500,000 vaccinations where is the equivalent space

1338
01:05:38,559 --> 01:05:40,607
Show me total covid deaths scale represent

1339
01:05:40,863 --> 01:05:43,679
Actually it's not clear immediately if you look at it what eat

1340
01:05:43,935 --> 01:05:44,703
Space represents

1341
01:05:44,959 --> 01:05:48,031
Staff so they are each labeled on the vaccination side

1342
01:05:48,287 --> 01:05:52,639
But the scale is so disordered on the death scale that it's really difficult to assess how the graph

1343
01:05:52,895 --> 01:05:54,687
Is set up just from a first plant

1344
01:05:55,455 --> 01:05:59,295
In order to make the dataset appear to match up this dude had to make the scale

1345
01:05:59,551 --> 01:06:00,063
Exactly what he

1346
01:06:00,831 --> 01:06:05,183
We're five sections of the graph on they represent 600 deaths

1347
01:06:05,439 --> 01:06:06,207
Sofive

1348
01:06:06,463 --> 01:06:07,743
Spaces is 600 deaths

1349
01:06:07,999 --> 01:06:09,023
On one side

1350
01:06:09,279 --> 01:06:11,839
Batman each space is 500,000 vaccinations

1351
01:06:12,095 --> 01:06:14,911
In order to make the the lines look

1352
01:06:15,423 --> 01:06:21,567
Like they have similar 5 million vaccinations

1353
01:06:21,823 --> 01:06:22,335
Three

1354
01:06:26,431 --> 01:06:27,711
In terms of making it like

1355
01:06:28,223 --> 01:06:30,015
Yeah I see what you're saying

1356
01:06:30,271 --> 01:06:33,855
On the death side each segment isn't labeled because it's a graph

1357
01:06:34,111 --> 01:06:35,135
It's built on cherry pick

1358
01:06:35,391 --> 01:06:40,511
And if the date or responsibly presented it wouldn't be something Alex could Marvel over like this

1359
01:06:41,791 --> 01:06:42,303
Very sad

1360
01:06:45,375 --> 01:06:45,887
Twitter

1361
01:06:48,447 --> 01:06:48,959
Like

1362
01:06:49,471 --> 01:06:51,263
I imagine if you took

1363
01:06:51,519 --> 01:06:52,031
Alex

1364
01:06:52,287 --> 01:06:53,823
To like a Hall of Mirrors

1365
01:06:54,335 --> 01:06:56,127
And just showed you your face

1366
01:06:56,383 --> 01:06:58,687
But through the wrong shaped mirror he be like

1367
01:06:58,943 --> 01:07:00,735
What happened to you

1368
01:07:00,991 --> 01:07:02,271
Are you okay

1369
01:07:02,527 --> 01:07:08,671
Your face is wavy now I don't know what's going on we need again again we wrestle with

1370
01:07:08,927 --> 01:07:11,487
Whether or not object permanence is something he is grass

1371
01:07:11,743 --> 01:07:12,255
Exactly

1372
01:07:12,511 --> 01:07:13,535
So this next clip

1373
01:07:14,559 --> 01:07:15,583
Gitim Italy think

1374
01:07:16,095 --> 01:07:17,119
Is where

1375
01:07:17,375 --> 01:07:18,143
Like this

1376
01:07:18,655 --> 01:07:20,703
Got2b parody it has to be

1377
01:07:21,471 --> 01:07:24,031
McDonald's

1378
01:07:24,543 --> 01:07:26,591
I don't normally

1379
01:07:26,847 --> 01:07:32,991
Drop a ball because

1380
01:07:36,319 --> 01:07:37,855
34

1381
01:07:39,903 --> 01:07:40,671
11 letters

1382
01:07:41,183 --> 01:07:43,231
Coming off of the vaccinated we showing all the numbers

1383
01:07:46,047 --> 01:07:48,351
Videos

1384
01:07:55,519 --> 01:07:56,031
As for what

1385
01:07:57,823 --> 01:08:00,639
Covid-19 murdering logic contest winner announced

1386
01:08:00,895 --> 01:08:03,967
So he's got a covid denial video contest

1387
01:08:04,223 --> 01:08:09,087
That he wasn't able to judge the winner of because too many people around him including himself. Covid

1388
01:08:14,463 --> 01:08:15,743
God

1389
01:08:15,999 --> 01:08:17,023
I feel like he should

1390
01:08:18,559 --> 01:08:24,703
If this has to be a joke right II if the next time he does any cause-and-effect

1391
01:08:24,959 --> 01:08:28,031
I'm going to hit him he does like

1392
01:08:28,287 --> 01:08:34,431
You know like how when you throw a ball it then hits the thing I'm like you don't understand that you don't understand

1393
01:08:34,687 --> 01:08:35,199
How's traffic to work

1394
01:08:35,455 --> 01:08:36,991
B & I don't care I don't care

1395
01:08:37,759 --> 01:08:38,271
Unreal

1396
01:08:39,039 --> 01:08:40,063
I understand like

1397
01:08:40,575 --> 01:08:43,903
The reality of people are sick so I couldn't find a winner for this contest

1398
01:08:44,671 --> 01:08:47,487
Wouldn't you want to present it as like I got too busy

1399
01:08:47,743 --> 01:08:48,767
Or something not like

1400
01:08:49,023 --> 01:08:55,167
Hey everybody had covid so I couldn't I couldn't get an award out for this covid video

1401
01:08:55,423 --> 01:09:00,543
All of you to make the best video about how covid is fake and is all a lie

1402
01:09:01,055 --> 01:09:03,359
I wanted to judge that however

1403
01:09:03,615 --> 01:09:07,711
Everyone I know has covid

1404
01:09:08,223 --> 01:09:11,039
So it was very difficult to judge the

1405
01:09:11,807 --> 01:09:12,575
Submissions

1406
01:09:12,831 --> 01:09:14,367
About how covid-19 real

1407
01:09:14,879 --> 01:09:16,159
While I was sick with covid

1408
01:09:16,415 --> 01:09:16,927
Now

1409
01:09:17,695 --> 01:09:18,207
Why

1410
01:09:18,719 --> 01:09:24,863
Not the reason you think the office if they made a show at the office but Alex

1411
01:09:25,119 --> 01:09:27,167
To show that would be one of the plot

1412
01:09:30,239 --> 01:09:32,799
How do we navigate this

1413
01:09:33,567 --> 01:09:39,455
And that would be like a two or three-week situation like at the writers room would Bandy about ideas

1414
01:09:39,711 --> 01:09:43,295
Then you have somebody go rated they have to come back and everybody to edit it

1415
01:09:43,551 --> 01:09:46,879
Together again brutal cuz life is a farce

1416
01:09:47,391 --> 01:09:49,183
Absolutely some big news though

1417
01:09:49,439 --> 01:09:53,023
About like things are going to be happening around Infowars

1418
01:09:53,535 --> 01:09:54,559

1419
01:09:55,583 --> 01:09:58,143
I want all these calls I do want to

1420
01:09:58,399 --> 01:10:00,191

Pray to God

1424
01:10:16,319 --> 01:10:17,087
Energized

1425

01:12:28,927 --> 01:12:29,695
Nailed it

1468
01:12:29,951 --> 01:12:30,463
What else

1469
01:12:30,719 --> 01:12:31,743
What else is there to say

1470
01:12:32,255 --> 01:12:34,303
Not much

1471
01:12:35,071 --> 01:12:35,583
Maryville

1472
01:12:36,095 --> 01:12:39,423
One of the other piece of information that I'd like to bring

1473
01:12:40,703 --> 01:12:44,287
This HR 550 what about it was introduced in January okay

1474
01:12:46,335 --> 01:12:48,127
If this year how many months ago

1475
01:12:48,383 --> 01:12:49,919
They've introduced

1476
01:12:50,431 --> 01:12:53,247
Tomorrow's

1477
01:12:59,135 --> 01:13:00,927
I do like the gravitas with it

1478
01:13:02,463 --> 01:13:02,975
They've introduced

1479
01:13:06,559 --> 01:13:07,071
It's going

1480
01:13:07,327 --> 01:13:11,167
It started at January several several 9/8 months ago

1481
01:13:11,935 --> 01:13:13,215
Whenever it happens

1482
01:13:13,471 --> 01:13:13,983
What a dork

1483
01:13:14,239 --> 01:13:17,311
Alex tells this really fun story

1484
01:13:17,567 --> 01:13:20,639
That's very not true about Bilderberg

1485
01:13:34,207 --> 01:13:35,999
We would hear them speak and say once we

1486
01:13:36,255 --> 01:13:38,559
Collapse of system they won't have money to protest.

1487
01:13:39,583 --> 01:13:40,095
Massachu

1488
01:13:43,935 --> 01:13:46,239
Some other crew is in other areas of Europe

1489
01:13:48,287 --> 01:13:52,383
I did not know

1490
01:13:56,479 --> 01:13:57,247
This never happened

1491
01:13:59,039 --> 01:13:59,551
Resume.

1492
01:14:02,367 --> 01:14:04,159
Killer retrofit that

1493
01:14:04,415 --> 01:14:06,719
To be a German accent

1494
01:14:07,231 --> 01:14:09,023
This story never happened

1495
01:14:09,279 --> 01:14:13,119
Alex would go Yellen to a bullhorn occasionally emitted hang out with

1496
01:14:13,631 --> 01:14:19,007
Complete nut bars like Daniel estulin or anti-semites like big Jim Tucker

1497
01:14:19,263 --> 01:14:21,055
And they would tell him a bunch of bulshit

1498
01:14:21,311 --> 01:14:22,079
That's what they

1499
01:14:22,335 --> 01:14:23,615
Stadler coverage of Bilderberg

1500
01:14:25,407 --> 01:14:27,967
Kind of appreciate that strategy of being like

1501
01:14:28,479 --> 01:14:31,295
I'm going to do a weirdly racist Asian accent

1502
01:14:31,807 --> 01:14:32,575
And then

1503
01:14:32,831 --> 01:14:34,623
I'm just going to say that it was German

1504
01:14:34,879 --> 01:14:37,951
I don't even know if that was an attempt at a racist Asian accent

1505
01:14:38,207 --> 01:14:41,279
I don't know what it was like it was just a part of his

1506
01:14:41,535 --> 01:14:43,327
His accent work is just a cactus

1507
01:14:43,583 --> 01:14:44,351
Accidentally becoming

1508
01:14:46,655 --> 01:14:48,447
There was a first call / Diana

1509
01:14:48,703 --> 01:14:50,495
A call but

1510
01:14:51,007 --> 01:14:52,031
Business picks up

1511
01:14:52,287 --> 01:14:54,079
Okay the next caller

1512
01:14:54,847 --> 01:14:56,127
I like I got to tell you

1513
01:14:57,151 --> 01:14:58,687
Sky used to be into the devil

1514
01:15:00,223 --> 01:15:00,991
Alex

1515
01:15:01,759 --> 01:15:04,063
Trying to reach you in lunch

1516
01:15:04,319 --> 01:15:05,599
Truck driver

1517
01:15:05,855 --> 01:15:07,135
53 year old male

1518
01:15:07,391 --> 01:15:09,695
Man I want to give you a hug

1519
01:15:11,231 --> 01:15:11,999
The statements

1520
01:15:12,255 --> 01:15:13,279
Since I was 13

1521
01:15:15,327 --> 01:15:16,351
The Holy Spirit

1522
01:15:18,143 --> 01:15:20,191
Hit me with a rock man

1523
01:15:20,447 --> 01:15:20,959
He woke me up

1524
01:15:21,471 --> 01:15:21,983
The truth

1525
01:15:23,263 --> 01:15:26,847
It's always Spirits takes me a lot and I just want to say something

1526
01:15:29,663 --> 01:15:30,431
Warren is

1527
01:15:31,967 --> 01:15:32,479
Okay

1528
01:15:38,367 --> 01:15:39,391
It's not something

1529
01:15:39,903 --> 01:15:40,415
It's a weakness

1530
01:15:41,183 --> 01:15:41,695
I'm just letting you know

1531
01:15:41,951 --> 01:15:43,231
That's the way they see it

1532
01:15:43,487 --> 01:15:45,023
We know that these people

1533
01:15:46,047 --> 01:15:47,071
Destroy this world

1534
01:15:52,191 --> 01:15:52,703
High Spirits

1535
01:15:53,215 --> 01:15:53,983
That's why

1536
01:15:55,007 --> 01:15:56,287
I'm just going to laugh

1537
01:15:56,543 --> 01:15:57,567
When people protest

1538
01:15:58,079 --> 01:15:59,103
Which is really a shame

1539
01:16:00,383 --> 01:16:02,943
Hard hard

1540
01:16:07,807 --> 01:16:10,111
Don't feel like this is a sort of stuff that Alex would like

1541
01:16:10,367 --> 01:16:11,391
Necessarily be

1542
01:16:11,647 --> 01:16:13,439
The firming and sort of enabling

1543
01:16:13,695 --> 01:16:14,719
He doesn't know what the

1544
01:16:14,975 --> 01:16:16,255
Perspective this caller is coming

1545
01:16:16,511 --> 01:16:19,071
I'd say that if someone were to approach me

1546
01:16:19,327 --> 01:16:20,351
And tell me that

1547
01:16:20,607 --> 01:16:22,911
They were satanists since they were 13

1548
01:16:23,423 --> 01:16:24,703
And recently the Lord has been

1549
01:16:24,959 --> 01:16:25,983
Been talking to them too much

1550
01:16:26,495 --> 01:16:27,007
Probably wouldn't

1551
01:16:27,263 --> 01:16:28,543
Extend that conversation much

1552
01:16:28,799 --> 01:16:29,311
Further

1553
01:16:29,823 --> 01:16:31,359
I probably be like

1554
01:16:31,615 --> 01:16:34,175
Oribi incredibly

1555
01:16:34,687 --> 01:16:36,735
If it were a private conversation I might be polite

1556
01:16:36,991 --> 01:16:39,807
Radio show

1557
01:16:40,575 --> 01:16:41,855
Let's talk a little bit

1558
01:16:42,623 --> 01:16:48,767
You're a what you do are you a long-haul trucker and you're saying that God is speaking to you all the time

1559
01:16:51,583 --> 01:16:52,351
Might not be got buddy

1560
01:16:52,607 --> 01:16:55,935
Exhausted

1561
01:16:56,191 --> 01:16:57,471
To who talk to your boss

1562
01:16:57,983 --> 01:16:58,751
About how they do

1563
01:16:59,007 --> 01:16:59,775
Distribute miles

1564
01:17:00,031 --> 01:17:01,311
And then figure out how to

1565
01:17:01,567 --> 01:17:03,359
I get a schedule that doesn't require you to go

1566
01:17:03,615 --> 01:17:09,759
You might have a c w McCall situation where someone's on the seat

1567
01:17:10,015 --> 01:17:10,527
BB true

1568
01:17:10,783 --> 01:17:11,807
Breaker breaker

1569
01:17:12,319 --> 01:17:14,111
Gods coming in calling your rubber duck

1570
01:17:14,367 --> 01:17:18,975
God if you knew that there was another truck driver at you you just kind of just

1571
01:17:19,487 --> 01:17:21,279
Every now and I got you have to try and talk with

1572
01:17:21,535 --> 01:17:23,327
The bright side I think I would be

1573
01:17:23,583 --> 01:17:29,727
Low Brotherhood

1574
01:17:29,983 --> 01:17:32,287
Sure the other truckers get together and they like

1575
01:17:32,543 --> 01:17:36,127
Gigantic vaccines

1576
01:17:37,663 --> 01:17:38,431
F*** with butt

1577
01:17:38,687 --> 01:17:39,199
Mothballs

1578
01:17:41,759 --> 01:17:45,855
So Alex keeps talking to this guy and he has some ideas about communism

1579
01:17:46,623 --> 01:17:48,415
What we are seeing happened right now

1580
01:17:52,767 --> 01:17:54,559
We're feet happened right now

1581
01:17:54,815 --> 01:17:56,607
Is that okay

1582
01:17:58,143 --> 01:18:00,703
Exactly chest about cognizant see here's the deal

1583
01:18:01,727 --> 01:18:02,239
Great

1584
01:18:02,495 --> 01:18:03,263
Exception

1585
01:18:03,519 --> 01:18:04,287
The Bible talks

1586
01:18:04,543 --> 01:18:05,311
Okay

1587
01:18:05,823 --> 01:18:08,895
The great deception is the largest human sacrifice

1588
01:18:09,151 --> 01:18:09,919
History

1589
01:18:10,943 --> 01:18:13,247
Android

1590
01:18:17,087 --> 01:18:23,231
They're all they're all in line to call the planet

1591
01:18:24,255 --> 01:18:25,023
Amazing call her

1592
01:18:25,535 --> 01:18:26,559
So I mean like look

1593
01:18:26,815 --> 01:18:31,935
Whenever people are doing that Rogan thing of like Alex's actually write a lot

1594
01:18:32,191 --> 01:18:34,239
Take that edge East answer

1595
01:18:34,751 --> 01:18:40,895
He's dumbfucks having aleksandrova actually

1596
01:18:41,151 --> 01:18:41,919
Owning is that

1597
01:18:42,431 --> 01:18:43,455
That's what they're actually own

1598
01:18:44,223 --> 01:18:44,991
It's not

1599
01:18:45,247 --> 01:18:46,015
Some kind of a fun

1600
01:18:46,527 --> 01:18:47,807
Show where they talk about

1601
01:18:49,343 --> 01:18:51,391
A reporting on

1602
01:18:51,647 --> 01:18:52,927
F****** social media post

1603
01:18:53,439 --> 01:18:55,231
That he hasn't even looked into at all

1604
01:18:55,487 --> 01:18:58,559
I've been rambling with some unhinged collar about the

1605
01:18:58,815 --> 01:19:00,351
Devil wanting to bring in communism

1606
01:19:00,607 --> 01:19:01,887
Death by killing everybody

1607
01:19:02,655 --> 01:19:03,167
Nonsense

1608
01:19:03,679 --> 01:19:04,703
Yeah they

1609
01:19:04,959 --> 01:19:06,495
The devil is really dropping

1610
01:19:06,751 --> 01:19:10,591
On the ball

1611
01:19:10,847 --> 01:19:11,615
Nicely done

1612
01:19:11,871 --> 01:19:12,639
Everything I've heard about the

1613
01:19:12,895 --> 01:19:13,407
Does deviled eggs

1614
01:19:14,431 --> 01:19:14,943
Does not know

1615
01:19:15,199 --> 01:19:15,711
What's

1616
01:19:21,855 --> 01:19:23,135
Married to a coat rack

1617
01:19:25,183 --> 01:19:25,695
I mean

1618
01:19:26,463 --> 01:19:29,535
I haven't been able to stop thinking about joper awhile now

1619
01:19:29,791 --> 01:19:32,607
Present our last episode for a while

1620
01:19:35,167 --> 01:19:38,751
Like I thought you might I thought you might go Blue

1621
01:19:39,007 --> 01:19:40,031
I don't care for jokes

1622
01:19:41,311 --> 01:19:42,591
No

1623
01:19:42,847 --> 01:19:43,359
Like

1624
01:19:44,383 --> 01:19:46,943
That exact moment in the Bible where God

1625
01:19:47,199 --> 01:19:49,247
Is doing his whole thing and he's like hey

1626
01:19:49,503 --> 01:19:50,271
F****** shut up

1627
01:19:50,527 --> 01:19:54,879
I'm literally God you don't understand what I'm doing why are you why are you being a dick about this

1628
01:19:55,135 --> 01:19:57,183
The point is

1629
01:19:57,951 --> 01:19:58,719
The universe is big

1630
01:19:58,975 --> 01:19:59,743
Just be a humble a******

1631
01:19:59,999 --> 01:20:00,767
You know right

1632
01:20:01,023 --> 01:20:01,791
And and

1633
01:20:03,071 --> 01:20:05,631
To be so misunderstood that these people

1634
01:20:06,143 --> 01:20:08,191
Cannot process Concepts that they

1635
01:20:08,447 --> 01:20:09,215
Don't understand

1636
01:20:09,471 --> 01:20:11,519
Like they don't have the humility to be like

1637
01:20:11,775 --> 01:20:13,824
Maybe I just don't understand

1638
01:20:14,080 --> 01:20:14,592
What's going on

1639
01:20:14,848 --> 01:20:19,200
Why would you think that the devil the literal devil

1640
01:20:19,456 --> 01:20:23,552
In a battle with god for eternity over man's soul

1641
01:20:23,808 --> 01:20:24,576
Yes it's like

1642
01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:26,112
Communism

1643
01:20:26,368 --> 01:20:27,136
I thought we're going to do it

1644
01:20:27,648 --> 01:20:28,416
Right and

1645
01:20:28,672 --> 01:20:29,696
Not only that but

1646
01:20:29,952 --> 01:20:33,280
Whatever happens to be the modern

1647
01:20:33,536 --> 01:20:39,680
The devil has always been

1648
01:20:40,192 --> 01:20:41,728
Every 5 years

1649
01:20:41,984 --> 01:20:42,752
Even though it's different

1650
01:20:43,776 --> 01:20:49,408
Yeah it's that immediacy bias of like whatever your most fascinated by now is the most fascinating thing

1651
01:20:49,664 --> 01:20:51,968
Trump guilty of it too

1652
01:20:52,480 --> 01:20:56,064
Super into Survivor right now and I definitely won't be in a few months

1653
01:20:56,576 --> 01:20:59,648
Sure talk about Seltzer if you want

1654
01:21:00,160 --> 01:21:05,792
Most important thing ever I got to tell you all about the south

1655
01:21:06,048 --> 01:21:09,120
Alex has the same way with the devil's plans

1656
01:21:09,376 --> 01:21:10,656
Yeah I know it's

1657
01:21:10,912 --> 01:21:11,424
Just said like

1658
01:21:11,936 --> 01:21:15,264
When you stop and you think about how many things

1659
01:21:15,520 --> 01:21:16,288
In your lifetime

1660
01:21:17,056 --> 01:21:18,080
You have been

1661
01:21:18,592 --> 01:21:19,104
Told

1662
01:21:19,872 --> 01:21:20,384
Hysterically

1663
01:21:20,640 --> 01:21:21,664
Are the markets

1664
01:21:22,944 --> 01:21:24,224
Like can you like

1665
01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:27,296
UPC symbols seriously barcodes

1666
01:21:27,552 --> 01:21:28,320
F****** many

1667
01:21:28,832 --> 01:21:29,344
Tattoos

1668
01:21:29,600 --> 01:21:30,112
Don't stop

1669
01:21:30,368 --> 01:21:34,976
Non-stop since I was a boy and it's never been the mark of the beast and everything that is

1670
01:21:35,488 --> 01:21:36,512
Similar to the mark of the beast

1671
01:21:36,768 --> 01:21:38,304
They just get a phone for

1672
01:21:39,584 --> 01:21:40,096
Is completely

1673
01:21:40,352 --> 01:21:43,936
Yeah but I like what you going to do I need to use a phone

1674
01:21:45,472 --> 01:21:50,080
Another caller and this guy is an anti-vaxxer

1675
01:21:50,848 --> 01:21:51,616
Does not like vaccines

1676
01:21:51,872 --> 01:21:52,384
What

1677
01:21:52,896 --> 01:21:53,920
Competent it

1678
01:21:54,176 --> 01:22:00,320
Professional would like to have a job someplace but they all wanted because

1679
01:22:00,576 --> 01:22:01,088
Button

1680
01:22:01,344 --> 01:22:02,112
Instead what he wants

1681
01:22:02,368 --> 01:22:03,648
To do is start like a LinkedIn

1682
01:22:03,904 --> 01:22:05,184
For people who don't want to take vaccine

1683
01:22:05,440 --> 01:22:05,952
Okay

1684
01:22:06,208 --> 01:22:07,488
We got it at work together

1685
01:22:08,768 --> 01:22:10,048
Construction

1686
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:12,608
Employers and employees

1687
01:22:14,912 --> 01:22:15,424
This new age

1688
01:22:15,680 --> 01:22:19,520
Bulletin board

1689
01:22:24,896 --> 01:22:29,248
Because I'm a hard-working father 31 on the way got a beautiful wife is my angel

1690
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:32,832
That works so hard to put all this information in my head.

1691
01:22:36,672 --> 01:22:37,696
You can go to a doctor

1692
01:22:43,584 --> 01:22:45,120
I know you're single

1693
01:22:48,704 --> 01:22:51,008
What I'm saying

1694
01:22:51,264 --> 01:22:54,848
You're not supposed to take something give you having a meal you can really hurt you

1695
01:22:55,872 --> 01:22:56,640
So

1696
01:22:59,712 --> 01:23:00,992
Alex

1697
01:23:01,504 --> 01:23:05,344
Defraud a doctor just say I've already had it

1698
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:06,624
What's a myth

1699
01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:07,392
Okay

1700
01:23:07,648 --> 01:23:08,160
Cool

1701
01:23:08,672 --> 01:23:14,816
I hear you saying like Okay yeah well that's what they should do I have these places you don't want to get vaccines they have this

1702
01:23:15,072 --> 01:23:16,352
Bulletin board for businesses

1703
01:23:16,608 --> 01:23:20,192
But I would say that the only way that that's acceptable

1704
01:23:20,448 --> 01:23:23,776
Is a vole so all of these businesses have to be very public

1705
01:23:24,032 --> 01:23:26,080
About our employees are not back

1706
01:23:26,336 --> 01:23:30,432
Your own discretion I wrote down I'm fine with that

1707
01:23:30,688 --> 01:23:31,456
Not because

1708
01:23:31,712 --> 01:23:32,224
I

1709
01:23:32,736 --> 01:23:34,272
It's a good idea or is that it's

1710
01:23:34,528 --> 01:23:35,296
Hey functional

1711
01:23:37,344 --> 01:23:43,488
It is at least in keeping with their like free-market ideas like the reason I say I'm fine with that is

1712
01:23:43,744 --> 01:23:46,304
Because I can find no hypocrisy and right right

1713
01:23:46,560 --> 01:23:47,840
But we believe the free market

1714
01:23:48,096 --> 01:23:48,608
You take care of it

1715
01:23:48,864 --> 01:23:52,960
Now obviously when it fails miserably they'll say it's not the free market and they should

1716
01:23:53,216 --> 01:23:55,776
Be able to kill all of us in order to make it work the way they want

1717
01:23:56,544 --> 01:23:57,056
But

1718
01:23:57,312 --> 01:23:58,336
In this situation

1719
01:23:59,104 --> 01:24:00,384
Theoretically it is the free bar

1720
01:24:02,688 --> 01:24:06,016
I mean I don't know if that means anything but yeah

1721
01:24:06,272 --> 01:24:09,600
You know what Alex might give him one

1722
01:24:10,112 --> 01:24:10,880
It's going to happen

1723
01:24:16,512 --> 01:24:19,072
I hear you brother sending your resume. I want extra money

1724
01:24:19,328 --> 01:24:21,120
RIT people about a week

1725
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:28,032
If you want to be part in between two more people are doing a lot of stuff

1726
01:24:28,288 --> 01:24:29,312
Please don't touch my pool

1727
01:24:29,824 --> 01:24:30,592
Your help

1728
01:24:32,896 --> 01:24:35,968
Can you deliver pool tiles products.com

1729
01:24:36,480 --> 01:24:39,552
Wintersun back in stock I called you out of a D3 we have

1730
01:24:40,064 --> 01:24:40,576
Nailed it

1731
01:24:41,600 --> 01:24:47,744
Yeah he has more people but also

1732
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:49,792
Plugged in the shell

1733
01:24:50,048 --> 01:24:51,840
Some however I might give

1734
01:24:52,096 --> 01:24:58,240
This guy money turns into you should give me money because then I'll have that money to give this guy

1735
01:25:00,544 --> 01:25:02,592
Honestly I really hope it gets back to

1736
01:25:02,848 --> 01:25:04,128
Pineda to work area

1737
01:25:04,640 --> 01:25:09,504
How many people around him have been

1738
01:25:10,016 --> 01:25:12,064
Passing this around I don't know if it

1739
01:25:12,320 --> 01:25:13,600
It's a good idea to work at Infowars

1740
01:25:13,856 --> 01:25:17,184
I guess even an ideal circumstances it's not a good idea to work there but

1741
01:25:17,696 --> 01:25:18,208
Now even more

1742
01:25:18,720 --> 01:25:20,768
It is it is funny how many people

1743
01:25:21,024 --> 01:25:21,792
Have noticed like

1744
01:25:22,560 --> 01:25:23,840
Conservative radio hosts

1745
01:25:24,864 --> 01:25:25,888
K o

1746
01:25:26,144 --> 01:25:26,656
Summit covid

1747
01:25:28,192 --> 01:25:28,960
TV

1748
01:25:29,472 --> 01:25:29,984
Conservative post

1749
01:25:30,496 --> 01:25:31,008
No covid

1750
01:25:32,032 --> 01:25:33,824
No coffee

1751
01:25:34,080 --> 01:25:35,360
How could that possibly be

1752
01:25:35,616 --> 01:25:37,664
What sort of income

1753
01:25:37,920 --> 01:25:40,736
Define the difference between tvo's

1754
01:25:40,992 --> 01:25:46,880
Conservative radio host at work

1755
01:25:47,136 --> 01:25:49,952
One is obviously but you're implying

1756
01:25:50,208 --> 01:25:51,744
What time the second thing is also like

1757
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:55,840
I think the TV people have much more vested interest in image

1758
01:25:56,352 --> 01:25:59,680
And like there could be people who have gotten sick and we just don't even know

1759
01:26:02,240 --> 01:26:04,032
Seem like a lot of people dying

1760
01:26:04,544 --> 01:26:05,312
Are radio host

1761
01:26:06,848 --> 01:26:07,872
That doesn't to happen

1762
01:26:08,128 --> 01:26:11,200
No I mean obviously there's there's a far

1763
01:26:11,456 --> 01:26:16,832
Bigger budget and more people who like

1764
01:26:17,344 --> 01:26:22,976
It's bad for us don't don't say that also the barrier-to-entry is a lot lower for radio host

1765
01:26:23,744 --> 01:26:26,560
Many many of them probably

1766
01:26:27,328 --> 01:26:29,120
You know

1767
01:26:30,144 --> 01:26:30,912
I mean look

1768
01:26:31,168 --> 01:26:35,008
If you were an 80s, eventually became a 2000's radio host that's how it works

1769
01:26:37,568 --> 01:26:42,176
Basically all I all I got is

1770
01:26:42,432 --> 01:26:43,200
Alex is just

1771
01:26:43,456 --> 01:26:43,968
Basically

1772
01:26:45,504 --> 01:26:46,272
What's that song

1773
01:26:46,528 --> 01:26:49,600
After show for the zombies

1774
01:26:49,856 --> 01:26:56,000
Your parents found on social media

1775
01:26:56,256 --> 01:27:02,144
Yes is Ridiculousness but for

1776
01:27:02,912 --> 01:27:04,704
Fake social media post

1777
01:27:05,472 --> 01:27:06,752
It's pretty sad

1778
01:27:08,032 --> 01:27:10,080
I never want to lose this image in my head

1779
01:27:10,336 --> 01:27:11,104
Because it's soap

1780
01:27:12,384 --> 01:27:15,712
Alex being unable to judge the covid video contest

1781
01:27:15,968 --> 01:27:17,248
Does everyone have a Coke

1782
01:27:17,504 --> 01:27:18,272
Unreal

1783
01:27:19,040 --> 01:27:23,648
I can't believe should be against the 888 should be against some sort of decency law or orgy

1784
01:27:23,904 --> 01:27:28,000
Like just literary law should apply in real life

1785
01:27:28,256 --> 01:27:31,840
This is too far when it comes out of Alex's mouth on air he should be like

1786
01:27:32,352 --> 01:27:37,216
Oh wait

1787
01:27:40,032 --> 01:27:44,384
Dawning irony that would just change the world wrong

1788
01:27:50,272 --> 01:27:56,416
Ty.com

1789
01:27:56,672 --> 01:27:59,488
Neo I'm Leo I'm dzx Clark I'm Darryl Ruckus

1790
01:28:00,768 --> 01:28:01,536
What the sex robot

1791
01:28:01,792 --> 01:28:03,840
Holding

1792
01:28:05,888 --> 01:28:08,960
Alexandra Thurston color
