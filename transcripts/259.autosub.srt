4
00:00:19,712 --> 00:00:25,856
Sucks I've never seen that I've heard a lot of sniping about it on Twitter

5
00:00:26,624 --> 00:00:32,768
Never asked me about anything that I know about you know what I mean like questions about like

6
00:00:33,024 --> 00:00:35,584
You ever done this

7
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,376
Legitimate expert

8
00:00:37,632 --> 00:00:43,776
So many possibilities

9
00:00:44,032 --> 00:00:47,360

00:00:47,616 --> 00:00:49,920
Sure Ready Player One

11
00:00:50,176 --> 00:00:54,528
I hear it's terrible I'll double down on it for you

12
00:00:54,784 --> 00:00:55,808
I'm not much of a move

13
00:00:56,064 --> 00:00:56,576
Movie guy

14
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:09,376
I have a real movie at home

15
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:14,240
Still sort of triggers the same parts of your brain where it's like you're going into the movie theater

16
00:01:14,496 --> 00:01:20,640
We are a kid you don't understand there's a projection is getting paid $4 an hour up there he was probably high

17
00:01:20,896 --> 00:01:24,224
Love you

18
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:27,040
Where do you work at a movie theater for long enough you just like

19
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:28,576
It starts to become a nuisance

20
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:30,880
You associate bad feelings with

21
00:01:31,136 --> 00:01:33,952
The feature itself and there's no there's no magic

22
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:35,744
Victor it actually makes you mad

23
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,792
Because the. That I lived

24
00:01:38,304 --> 00:01:39,328
Who was the time when

25
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,632
You was transitioning from

26
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:42,400
Trouble film

27
00:01:42,656 --> 00:01:45,216
To digital answer what they did was essentially

28
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:51,616
Get rid of experts dealing with this

29
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:52,896
Projectors

30
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:54,432
Troubleshooting problems

31
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:56,480
And then all of a sudden all you have to do is hit a button

32
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:59,040
Answer like I even have that resentment

33
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:00,832
Inside me when I think about movies

34
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:07,232
Watch movies

35
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:14,656
I do.

36
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:16,448
Sirius just like

37
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:17,216
Don't do that

38
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:21,568
We will just fire you really sad

00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:27,456
I don't I don't

41
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:31,040
Those are

42
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:34,880
The generally Arctic commercial movie

43
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:38,976
Projectors for IMAX theater

44
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:43,072
Much more specialized

45
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:45,888
We we sort of flirted

46
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:53,312
Never got off the ground never happened but I love working with film

47
00:02:53,568 --> 00:02:54,592
Like I loved it

48
00:02:57,152 --> 00:03:03,296
Movies much I want

49
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:07,648
Alex Jones screaming

50
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:14,048
But if you watch a movie you don't learn that much but from what I've done I know a lot about Alex

51
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:15,584
Ready Player one and how much

52
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:20,192
Recently watched it

53
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:26,848
Big Show

54
00:03:27,104 --> 00:03:30,176
29th

55
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:31,456
2019

56
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:33,248
I assume nothing important happened in

57
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:38,880
Stuff happens.

58
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:45,280
And we will see why very interesting stuff so I got to go

59
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:46,816
Who shot up donors

60
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:49,120
Hell yeah but I also need to make an apology

61
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:52,704
We offered

62
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:59,104
I'm going to forward Gmail to our mailing Department

63
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,640
Because we have

64
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:01,920
Probably less button

65
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:05,248
Give us a little time

66
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,600
Keep it a little bit of time we will send them out

67
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:16,000
Is that I can figure out

68
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:24,959
Give a shout out to

69
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:29,567
I'd like to say

70
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:31,615
Your nail polish

71
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:33,151

Spell hannes

79
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:03,103
Thank you so much

80
00:05:04,895 --> 00:05:07,199
I love you

81
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:08,479
Guys if you're out there

82
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:09,759
Listening

83
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:15,647
You want to support the show you like what we do a website

84
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:17,695
And I would appreciate it

85
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:22,815
Today

86
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:31,263
Discovered that Rodger Stone have been indicted right pretty standard response from him

87
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:32,543
Pretty low-key

88
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:42,783
I've recovered

89
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:44,319
Hop it is

90
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:45,343
Immediately

91
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:49,695
I was

92
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:55,583
Kind of Alex Jones response to a crisis

93
00:05:56,863 --> 00:05:59,679
Our show is going to pick up today on the 27th

94
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:00,447
Sunday

95
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:02,239
Go till Tuesday

96
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:06,847
. of time we will see a much more sincere response

97
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:09,919
But Alex Jones Rodger Stone being indicted

98
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:12,223
It will

99
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:14,271
Very gratifying for

100
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:15,039
Everyone

101
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:17,599
But we have to jump in on the 27th

102
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:18,623
And all this

103
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:19,647
This clip

104
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:22,207
Goats gets a little bit of islamophobic which is

105
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:22,975
Cool

106
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:23,999
For him

107
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:25,023
I guess

108
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:26,559
But also

109
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:27,327
Says

110
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:30,911
Are getting murdered

111
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:35,263
12/13 week

112
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:45,503
Islamic women

113
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:46,527
Leftist

114
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:49,343
Operations of government facilities

115
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:53,183
Infrastructure

116
00:06:58,047 --> 00:06:58,815
Some people do

117
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:07,519
Yeah. It would do something like that but it's just people trying to kill

118
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:17,503
That's not good

119
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:24,159
He's celebrating political murders I don't know if these are actually

120
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:27,487
Murders or anything or he's just make

121
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:33,887
I don't know I don't really care care on some level in terms of tracing this down I Don't Care About Us

122
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:36,447
Covering it necessarily

123
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:44,383
Hey people are politically disagree with our getting murdered and I'm f****** pumped about it love it

124
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:48,223
So it was a clip he starts talking about some of his

125
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:50,271
His political concerns

126
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:51,551
In this

127
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:53,343
Late January

128
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:54,367
2019

129
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:55,135
Sphere

130
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:55,903
Interesting

131
00:07:57,183 --> 00:07:57,695
To be upset about

132
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:09,215
We've got deleted

133
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:15,103
Vice president

134
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:19,199
Next

135
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:20,735
Next year's news

136
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:24,575
Breitbart article

137
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:29,439
It's really just a collection of screenshotted people reacting to an article

138
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:30,975
About the possibility of Pelosi

139
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:31,743
Becoming president

140
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:34,815
Even the article that Alex is talking about every right to

141
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:37,375
Person doesn't really think that Washington politicians

142
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:40,447
Especially one as pants

143
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:41,983
12020 is fast

144
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:42,751
Approaching

145
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:45,055
It's not like they can't be tried when they're out of office

146
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:52,479
Also according to the 25th Amendment it is true the Pelosi would become president

147
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:53,247
Is Trump

148
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:56,063
We're kicked out of office or resigned at the same time

149
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:58,367
But odds are that would never happen

150
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:02,463
If they're both convicted of impeachment

151
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:03,743
But there's no chance

152
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:06,559
Those trials could be carried out before the 2020

153
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:10,655
There's also zero chance that they would ever resign at the same time

154
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:11,679
For this reason

155
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:14,239
If Pence becomes president

156
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:16,543
But Pelosi doesn't become vice president

157
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:19,871
Pencil points his new vice president then enters the presidential

158
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:21,663
Succession Bridge right at the top

159
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:24,479
If they were going to both resigned

160
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:25,503
The Panthers news

161
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:26,527
Be with them send

162
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:28,831
To the presidency that's being able to park both of them

163
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:32,159
There's zero Gane and resigning simultaneously

164
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:33,183
And they would never

165
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:39,583
Ever do the only reason they both get hit by a

166
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:41,631
Meteor in the same at the same

167
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:42,911
You know it's not like

168
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:48,543
Even if that does happen

169
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:50,335
If Nancy Pelosi

170
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:53,407
Hillary Clinton as her vice president

171
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:54,943
I think I will be fine with him

172
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:57,247
Teaching her to

173
00:09:57,503 --> 00:10:00,063
Clean out there's no way that would ever happen with her

174
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:03,647
The new president or vice president

175
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:07,487
That person has to be approved by majority vote in both houses of Congress

176
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:11,071
You're never going to get vice president Hillary Clinton through the Senate

177
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:14,399
E-Z Pass through the house

178
00:10:14,655 --> 00:10:15,167
Quite Frank

179
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:17,983
District is impossible as a real-world scenario

180
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:20,031
I was just doesn't understand

181
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:24,127
He's trying to bring up his old favorite anime to make her relevant again

182
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:25,407
I think that

183
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:31,039
Of your I think they all are I think everyone is but Alex

184
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:31,807
Is now starting

185
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:32,831
Realize

186
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:37,951
Hillary

187
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:41,535
Yeah almost immediately after that

188
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:44,863
He starts venting a little bit of frustration with the

189
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:46,655
He's godkin Donald Trump

190
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:48,703
I'm going to say this right now

191
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:49,727
The president

192
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:57,407
Are not defending yourself

193
00:10:57,919 --> 00:10:59,199
Not defending your family

194
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:05,855
In one critical area

195
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:14,047
Cheryl

196
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:24,287
Nope

197
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:31,455
Self-help cover-up

198
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:33,503
Crimes of the clintons and other for the Russian

199
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:36,063
And other

200
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:41,183
Help deliver uranium to the Russians on the

201
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:45,279
Bones

202
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:47,839
Using vulgar as a

203
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:48,607
Hitman

204
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:49,375
Boston

205
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:55,263
Mafia 2 cheats

206
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:57,311
Other white shoe boy Robert Mueller

207
00:11:58,335 --> 00:12:00,383
Luca Brasi of the FBI

208
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:03,711
He's the guy in 911

209
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:07,807
Grayed out by Kevin

210
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:10,367
Any blind ultimasaurus

211
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:13,183
PoBoy dirtiest of the dirty dirty

212
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:15,999
I don't know how dirty that is

213
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:18,559
I really care about

214
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:19,583
Complaints about Mueller

215
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:20,607
Because they also

216
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:24,447
Rotate gravitate around

217
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:32,895
Is Alex starting to be like f******

218
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:34,175
Trump you're not doing it

219
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:35,199
You're not doing

220
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:38,271
You're that

221
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:39,295
Similar things

222
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:43,647
But I wonder if that's going to develop Trump right now

223
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:45,951
And I wouldn't use the words of Ronald Reagan

224
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:47,999
Mr. Trump

225
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:53,887
Tear down this wall s*** no that was

226
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:55,935
Starting to

227
00:12:56,191 --> 00:12:58,751
Feel little bit like Trump you're not doing your job and I'll protect

228
00:12:59,007 --> 00:12:59,775
Country yourself

229
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:00,543
Finger Family

230
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:02,591
I'm not

231
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:08,735
Alex has another fire

232
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:10,271
And by this point Alex

233
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:12,063
Probably read that indictment

234
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:18,463
You know if you can

235
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:19,487
Absolutely

236
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:22,559
I'm so he's got to do a little bit of damage control for Rodger

237
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:24,095
He tries

238
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:32,543
Rodger Stone there's nothing there

239
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:44,831
Acting like a gangster when they're there is some of that in there

240
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:45,599
Text Art

241
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:46,367
Okay

242
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:47,647
Call Ray

243
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:54,815
Wow I really just Rodger

244
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:56,095
Reply

245
00:13:56,351 --> 00:13:59,679
You just acting like a gang Saint guess what would you act like a gangster

246
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:04,287
That's still threatening

247
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,943
Is the best

248
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:17,599
Rodger Stone

249
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:22,207
Texting Randy credico still a problem

250
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:25,535
Understand

251
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:29,631
3D just doesn't have it in him

252
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:32,447
To really think about how to defend Rodger really

253
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:33,215
F*** it

254
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:34,495
I-88

255
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:36,287
It sounds so much like

256
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:42,175
Rodger

257
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:43,199
So

258
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:47,039
You got you got a lot on his plate you got a lot going on

259
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:50,623
He accidentally makes a couple of unforced

260
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:51,903
On this episode

261
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:55,231
The first of them

262
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:56,255
Is Vic

263
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:58,559
Completely bungles his

264
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:00,607
And I

265
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:04,703
Paradigm is a is an illusion

266
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:07,519
His shades of this all the time

267
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:10,335
What he says Global is t means Democrat

268
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:13,663
Right

269
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:20,063
Write designation

270
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:22,367
Someone with

271
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:23,135
The globalist

272
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:26,719
Almost unparalleled with people who are

273
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:28,767
The liberal side

274
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:30,559
And it confuses basically

275
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:34,655
Says that every Republican part of the globalist

276
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:36,959
Brautigan

277
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:39,519
A bipartisan group

278
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:44,895
Democrat

279
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:52,319
1989

280
00:15:56,159 --> 00:16:02,303
And then they all got lazy or whatever and trouble.

281
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:03,839
What's the point

282
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:10,495
His timeline is Sokka

283
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:16,127
Respect in terms of control

284
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:21,503
Blue

285
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:26,879
I just

286
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:32,511
Irrelevant

287
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:42,495
Because listen to this where he makes his second unforced error

288
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:54,783
I just want to

289
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:04,767
Americana

290
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:19,103
The whole system

291
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:21,919
What the f***

292
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:22,943
Alex

293
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:29,343
Our little bit of fascism

294
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:34,719
Eddie Redmayne Style

295
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:40,351
It's perfect John Wayne Americana with a thin veneer of fascism over it

296
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:46,751
I feel like most of his career has been predicated on the idea of a little bit of bleach do a whole lot of it

297
00:17:47,007 --> 00:17:48,031
The problem is

298
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:52,127
When you have fascist icing

299
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:52,895
You put a

300
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:53,663
The little

301
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:57,759
Joke candles of white nationalism on top and no matter how hard you blow that

302
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:07,999
That to me is like your head's not in the game from the hip Sunday Atlanta

303
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:14,399
Gives a f*** anyone listening

304
00:18:14,655 --> 00:18:18,751
Fever of fascist Isaac strawberries

305
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:20,287
Strawberry cream

306
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:24,383
I like orange

307
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:25,919
That's the way to go

308
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:31,039
Real sad to see that you know

309
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:33,599
It sure drop is kind of a fascist

310
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:37,951
It's too hot what

311
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:41,279
Brightly for so long then for him to just stay

312
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:42,047
It like

313
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:43,839
It's like when you're blackmailing somebody

314
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:45,887
And they're just like you know what f*** it I'm

315
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:46,655
Just going to come out

316
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:47,679
You lose your whole

317
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:50,751
Right

318
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:51,519
Admitting he's a fan

319
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:53,311
What are we what are we going to

320
00:18:55,871 --> 00:18:59,455
I need Waze presenting is classic Alex

321
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:04,575
Does a little bit of a ferret

322
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:07,135
Which is let me that's what he should be saying

323
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:10,207
Like if you were being more intellectually honest with his audience

324
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:13,023
He would have been saying stuff like that all along

325
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:14,559
Because where Alex lives

326
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:15,583
And where he comes from

327
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:17,119
Is rampant

328
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:18,911
Anti-communist propaganda

329
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:20,447
Red-baiting nonsense

330
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:22,495
From Cold War

331
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:25,055
The people who are his

332
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:26,847
Spiritual predecessor

333
00:19:27,103 --> 00:19:27,615
That's

334
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:28,895
They would be fine

335
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:30,687
With Americana fascism

336
00:19:30,943 --> 00:19:31,711
As opposed to

337
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:32,991
The Communist Menace

338
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:34,527
That they built up because

339
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:38,111
American fascism would still be a ruthless capitalist system

340
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:43,743
Plenty of characterized

341
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:48,095
Business

342
00:19:48,351 --> 00:19:53,215
Generation literally said all the time hey you guys are fast

343
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:54,751
Call Ross

344
00:19:55,007 --> 00:19:55,775
Right2know

345
00:19:56,031 --> 00:19:59,615
Is a little bit of getting right with God

346
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:01,919
Even

347
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:02,943
Too much too

348
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:04,735
To throw out there but like

349
00:20:06,015 --> 00:20:08,831
When he says that it's easy to look at that is like

350
00:20:09,087 --> 00:20:09,855
Like a pig f****** and

351
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:14,207
You take another step back and it's like

352
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:14,975
Oh

353
00:20:15,231 --> 00:20:15,999
That's more honest

354
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:22,143
You have to deflect every single possible

355
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:23,423
Criticism

356
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:27,007
But now you're opening yourself up to the idea of like

357
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:30,079
Yeah yep these are there are some negative

358
00:20:30,335 --> 00:20:32,127
Real serious negative things

359
00:20:35,455 --> 00:20:38,271
Today's after Rodger Stone

360
00:20:38,527 --> 00:20:40,831
He's a little bit

361
00:20:46,463 --> 00:20:48,255
What is the same time

362
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:49,791
More whistleblowers under

363
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:55,423
He was

364
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:59,519
Right

365
00:21:01,311 --> 00:21:02,847
Differences you haven't spent

366
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:07,711
3 years everyday flaking every criticism of Obama and then

367
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:11,295
Then what's your best friend used to be

368
00:21:11,551 --> 00:21:17,696
420 f****** years gets indicted you start saying you know what Obama was real f***** up with the Drone

369
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:19,232
To me is monumental

370
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:24,608
On the nose

371
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:26,400
Well you can Austin trip on

372
00:21:27,424 --> 00:21:28,704
If you if you got the

373
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,520
Container open maybe you're eating it with your finger and you know

374
00:21:32,032 --> 00:21:34,592
Not supposed to do that

375
00:21:34,848 --> 00:21:36,896
Flip your foot on there then all the sudden

376
00:21:37,152 --> 00:21:38,688
You believe that Trump is a good president

377
00:21:38,944 --> 00:21:39,712
That's just how it goes

378
00:21:40,736 --> 00:21:42,784
Rodger

379
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:45,344
Deflecting and what-have-you at the end of this Sunday show

380
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,648
Alex's big criticisms

381
00:21:47,904 --> 00:21:50,208
Is you're being too much about your own

382

383
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:52,768
Go on the offense

384
00:21:53,024 --> 00:21:55,840
I need you to be the Rodger stone that attacks people

385
00:21:56,096 --> 00:21:58,656
And you're just saying you're innocent all the time

386
00:21:59,168 --> 00:21:59,680
Again

387
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:00,448

388
00:22:10,176 --> 00:22:12,736

392
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,208
To do that

393
00:22:54,464 --> 00:22:56,512
Unfortunately in a court of law

394
00:22:56,768 --> 00:22:59,072
Prove that I was a liar

395
00:22:59,328 --> 00:23:00,608
Can have our bullshits

396
00:23:02,656 --> 00:23:08,032
You can help me in my real-world all I can do

397
00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:09,824

So much we need money

416
00:24:42,496 --> 00:24:44,032

417
00:24:44,544 --> 00:24:47,360
More so than probably in the past

418
00:24:47,872 --> 00:24:48,896
An actual reason

Depressing

423
00:25:04,512 --> 00:25:07,072
What you see here is almost exactly what you'd expect

424
00:25:07,328 --> 00:25:08,352
Except for those

425
00:25:09,632 --> 00:25:11,936
The idea that Alex is more honestly

426
00:25:12,192 --> 00:25:13,728
Talking about Trump

427
00:25:13,984 --> 00:25:14,752
Latin fascist temp

428
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,800
The idea that

429
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:21,152
Frustration with Trump about not standing up for himself in the country

430
00:25:21,664 --> 00:25:23,200
Aunt

431
00:25:23,968 --> 00:25:24,480
And

432
00:25:24,736 --> 00:25:29,088
Frustration with Rodger

433
00:25:29,344 --> 00:25:32,672
Although his version of going on the attack is just doing exactly what they were doing

434
00:25:32,928 --> 00:25:34,976
All the time

435
00:25:36,512 --> 00:25:38,816
Why won't you deflect with me instead of

436
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:41,632
Answer

437
00:25:42,144 --> 00:25:44,448
Did Sunday show sorting

438
00:25:45,472 --> 00:25:46,240
It is

439
00:25:46,752 --> 00:25:48,288
Peaks my interest but

440
00:25:49,312 --> 00:25:52,128
Really I had it I had a hunch when I listen to it

441
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:54,176
We were in for something

442
00:25:54,432 --> 00:25:55,968
But I didn't know quite what

443
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,784
Until I turned on the Monday show

444
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:00,576
Advancing spiral

445
00:26:01,088 --> 00:26:02,112
And my mind

446
00:26:03,904 --> 00:26:04,928
Completely blocked

447
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,464
What we are about to win

448
00:26:07,488 --> 00:26:08,768
Is Alex Jones

449
00:26:09,024 --> 00:26:10,560
Pretend for The Last 5 Years

450
00:26:11,328 --> 00:26:11,840
Okay

451
00:26:12,096 --> 00:26:18,240
Why aren't you trying to deal with some of the issues of the present he's going to pretend he's 2009 Alex

452
00:26:21,312 --> 00:26:22,080
Well I mean

453
00:26:22,336 --> 00:26:24,640
Our framework

454
00:26:25,152 --> 00:26:26,432
Trying to act like

455
00:26:26,688 --> 00:26:27,712
Pretend hey

456
00:26:27,968 --> 00:26:30,272
I didn't spend all that time being trumped bootlicker

457
00:26:30,784 --> 00:26:36,928
That's basically what he's going to do on this Monday episode and it's completely crazy

458
00:26:37,184 --> 00:26:38,464
Soon as we jump into the episode

459
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:40,000
And he gets back to

460
00:26:40,768 --> 00:26:42,304
Trying to cover the topic

461
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:44,608
Trying to cover issues that are important

462
00:26:45,632 --> 00:26:48,448
Before I go live

463
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:56,128
You know what

464
00:26:56,896 --> 00:27:02,016
Autism statistics

Measles measles mumps rubella

468
00:27:21,728 --> 00:27:24,288
I love it

469
00:27:24,544 --> 00:27:28,896
You do the research stay on our doing TED Talk

470
00:27:29,408 --> 00:27:32,480
And we'll get into a little bit

471
00:27:32,736 --> 00:27:38,880
I long for this version of Alex Wright

472
00:27:44,768 --> 00:27:50,912
He's quite literally just white nationalist propaganda has been used since time immemorial to demonize non-white pop

473
00:27:51,168 --> 00:27:51,936
Population

474
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:54,240

476
00:27:55,264 --> 00:27:59,360
There's no evidence to show that migrants are spread eagle

Who directs the center for humanitarian Health at Johns Hopkins school of public

478
00:28:06,016 --> 00:28:06,528
Keep migrants out

479
00:28:07,296 --> 00:28:13,440
The article goes on to discuss health issues

480
00:28:13,952 --> 00:28:15,744
Deeply relies on immigrants

481
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,328
As a recent study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association

482
00:28:20,608 --> 00:28:22,656
16% of healthcare workers in the US

483
00:28:22,912 --> 00:28:23,680
Reborn somewhere else

484
00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:25,728
Including 29% of Physicians

485
00:28:25,984 --> 00:28:27,776
16% of registered nurses

486
00:28:28,032 --> 00:28:30,848
20% of Pharmacists 24% of deaths

487
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:33,408
And 23% of nursing psychiatric

488
00:28:33,664 --> 00:28:34,176
In home health care

489
00:28:35,712 --> 00:28:36,736
I checked out

490
00:28:39,296 --> 00:28:41,344
Essential piece of establishing an authoritarian

491
00:28:42,368 --> 00:28:43,648
The scapegoating of the other

492
00:28:44,672 --> 00:28:48,256
It is crucial that the argument

493
00:28:48,512 --> 00:28:50,560
Arby's

494
00:28:50,816 --> 00:28:51,584
Defensive measures

495
00:28:52,352 --> 00:28:56,192
The Nazis created tons of propaganda about Jews being lice

496
00:28:56,704 --> 00:28:59,264
Which was something they were trying to protect the German people from

497
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:02,592
Even prior to that Jews were consistently baselessly blame for

498
00:29:02,848 --> 00:29:03,872
Play

499
00:29:04,384 --> 00:29:06,176
But even outside of authoritarian

500
00:29:06,432 --> 00:29:10,528
Concerned there's a serious Western history to blame disease on something external

501
00:29:10,784 --> 00:29:13,088
As if somehow admitting that we're all susceptible to

502
00:29:13,344 --> 00:29:14,368
The illness would be admitting

503
00:29:14,624 --> 00:29:15,392
Weakness or Sim

504
00:29:15,904 --> 00:29:19,744
In the 1830s Irish immigrants are scapegoated for causing Colorado

505
00:29:22,304 --> 00:29:25,376
During the Renaissance. The British called syphilis the French disease

506
00:29:25,632 --> 00:29:27,936
Although the thought it was the Italians fault

507
00:29:28,192 --> 00:29:29,216
And the Italians

508
00:29:29,472 --> 00:29:29,984
Finger at the French

509
00:29:30,752 --> 00:29:32,800
Bigotries are confirmed by blaming others

510
00:29:33,056 --> 00:29:33,568
Miss wife

511
00:29:36,128 --> 00:29:39,968
From African-Americans and syphilis to the homosexual community in Hy-Vee in

512
00:29:40,736 --> 00:29:42,528
This mentality it best is useless

513
00:29:43,552 --> 00:29:44,320
Current progress

514
00:29:44,576 --> 00:29:47,392
And it works is employed by authoritarian rulers

515
00:29:47,648 --> 00:29:49,440
Define out-group

516
00:29:49,696 --> 00:29:50,464
And make certain that

517
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:51,744
The in-group has a built-in

518
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:52,768
Fear of the outdoor

519
00:29:55,584 --> 00:29:56,096
Your

520
00:29:56,352 --> 00:29:56,864
Like it

521
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:59,168
Counterproductive

522
00:29:59,424 --> 00:30:00,448
You're trying to do

523
00:30:00,704 --> 00:30:03,008
At the same time your demonizing immigrants

524
00:30:03,264 --> 00:30:03,776
Spreading disease

525
00:30:04,288 --> 00:30:05,056
You're spreading

526
00:30:08,384 --> 00:30:12,736
You know you're only hurting

527
00:30:15,296 --> 00:30:16,832
A Milbank quarterly paper

528
00:30:17,088 --> 00:30:18,368

00:30:18,624 --> 00:30:20,672

00:30:25,536 --> 00:30:26,304
Alex likes headlines

Restart the. From the late 1800s

534
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:32,960
The present-day rhetoric

535
00:30:33,216 --> 00:30:36,544
Can policy explicitly medical language

536
00:30:37,312 --> 00:30:40,384
One in which the line between perceived and actual threat

537
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,408
Is flipper

538
00:30:41,664 --> 00:30:43,456
And prone to hysteria and hyperbole

539
00:30:43,968 --> 00:30:46,016
They found it throughout our country's wonderful history

540
00:30:46,272 --> 00:30:47,296
Policymakers

541
00:30:47,552 --> 00:30:48,320
Employees strike

542
00:30:48,576 --> 00:30:50,880
Pro diem medical labels of exclusion

543
00:30:51,392 --> 00:30:53,696
And quote in order to use Medical

544
00:30:54,464 --> 00:30:55,744
Exclude people that they deemed

545
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:56,512
Objectionable

546
00:30:57,024 --> 00:31:00,864
This is the driving force behind this rhetoric and explains why the rhetoric persist

547
00:31:01,376 --> 00:31:04,448
Even long after improve Healthcare all but eliminates the need

548
00:31:04,704 --> 00:31:05,984
Need to be concerned about the underlined

549
00:31:07,008 --> 00:31:08,032
He's all the function

The Journal of the American Medical Association

Series a very in-depth study

555
00:31:17,504 --> 00:31:19,552
About the connection between willful non vaccination

556
00:31:19,808 --> 00:31:20,832
Outbreaks of Axiom

557
00:31:21,088 --> 00:31:21,600
Preventable disease

558
00:31:22,368 --> 00:31:24,928
In one instance

559
00:31:25,952 --> 00:31:27,232
For which they had access to

560
00:31:27,744 --> 00:31:30,304
Nation records for people involved

561
00:31:31,072 --> 00:31:34,144
Outbreaks ahead information about

562
00:31:34,656 --> 00:31:37,216
The incidence of intentionally unvaccinated individuals

563
00:31:37,472 --> 00:31:38,496
Would never lower the

564
00:31:38,752 --> 00:31:39,520
59%

His Highest 90s

567
00:31:42,848 --> 00:31:45,664
And another they discuss findings from 18 measles outbreak

568
00:31:46,432 --> 00:31:49,504
Where they found that other cases they had vaccination records for

569
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:53,344
70.6% of individuals involved

570
00:31:53,856 --> 00:31:54,624
Vaccination

571
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,416
Which is what Alex promotes

572
00:31:57,184 --> 00:32:00,768
Put the epidemiology of transmission

573
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,048
Was that quote

574
00:32:02,304 --> 00:32:08,448
Children vaccine exemptions have a substantially greater risk for acquiring measles in fully vaccinated children

575
00:32:08,704 --> 00:32:12,288
In one study the risk was 35 times that of the vaccine

576
00:32:13,312 --> 00:32:14,336
Quotes

577
00:32:14,592 --> 00:32:18,944
Higher rates of vaccination exemption and Community are associated with greater measles

578
00:32:19,712 --> 00:32:20,224
In that community

579
00:32:20,992 --> 00:32:22,528
These are literally the same thing

580
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:27,136
Another peer-reviewed study published in the public library science

581
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:30,720
Alexander the areas of high rates of non-medical exempt

582
00:32:30,976 --> 00:32:31,488
Pencil vaccinate

583
00:32:32,256 --> 00:32:34,048
Part of their findings

584
00:32:34,304 --> 00:32:36,096
Of the 2014 measles outbreak

585
00:32:37,888 --> 00:32:39,424
Would you like to 111 cases

586
00:32:40,448 --> 00:32:45,312
Oakland California a city with a high rate of non-medical exempt

587
00:32:45,824 --> 00:32:46,336
The vaccination

588
00:32:46,848 --> 00:32:49,152
You can track if people have done it

589
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:54,016
Places with all of these automatic exemption

590
00:32:54,528 --> 00:32:55,040
Always

591
00:32:55,296 --> 00:32:56,320
Have more in

592
00:32:56,832 --> 00:32:57,856
Dances of Thieves

593
00:32:58,112 --> 00:32:59,136
Preventable diseases

594
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:00,928
It's nonsense

595
00:33:01,184 --> 00:33:01,952
Sounds like there is

596
00:33:02,208 --> 00:33:03,744
They're definitely tons of studies

597
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:04,512
Is the Baptist

598
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:07,840
Although there is no data to suggest that immigrants

599
00:33:08,096 --> 00:33:09,120
You're coming

600
00:33:09,376 --> 00:33:10,400
The country are insects

601
00:33:11,168 --> 00:33:12,192
That is purely

602
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:13,984
White nationalist nativist

603
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:14,752
Propaganda

604
00:33:15,008 --> 00:33:16,032
Alex Jones putting out

605
00:33:16,544 --> 00:33:17,056
8

606
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:18,592
Has so much

607
00:33:18,848 --> 00:33:21,152
To do

608
00:33:21,408 --> 00:33:21,920
S*** like that

609
00:33:22,176 --> 00:33:24,224
Cuz the movie Narrative of those in

610
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:26,016
Is always

611
00:33:26,528 --> 00:33:27,808
You know somebody got on Apple

612
00:33:28,064 --> 00:33:31,392
Playing from and then they showed up in your town

613
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:32,672
Spreading around

614
00:33:33,952 --> 00:33:35,488
You say

615
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:36,768
Percent of non vax

616
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:38,560
Children

617
00:33:39,072 --> 00:33:39,584
60% of the p

618
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:40,352
People who are hit by

619
00:33:40,864 --> 00:33:41,376
Measles outbreak

620

Measles outbreak

623
00:33:45,728 --> 00:33:48,800
If patient zero wasn't book

624
00:33:49,056 --> 00:33:50,080
But that's part of the study

625
00:33:50,336 --> 00:33:54,432
Generation of the

626
00:33:55,456 --> 00:33:55,968
Contagion

627
00:33:56,224 --> 00:34:02,368
Epidemiology part of it

628
00:34:06,976 --> 00:34:09,792
The Narrative studies

629
00:34:14,656 --> 00:34:16,448
Boredness of germs

630
00:34:16,704 --> 00:34:18,496
There is an obsession on our part

631
00:34:19,008 --> 00:34:19,520
Something

632
00:34:21,824 --> 00:34:23,104
And I think

633
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:23,872
FaceTime

634
00:34:24,384 --> 00:34:25,664
Sensitive religious tradition where

635
00:34:27,712 --> 00:34:28,480
Beans that you did something

636
00:34:32,064 --> 00:34:33,600
Vestigial part of our brain

637
00:34:33,856 --> 00:34:35,136

00:34:40,256 --> 00:34:40,768
Poverty

640
00:34:42,048 --> 00:34:42,560
The same thing

641
00:34:44,096 --> 00:34:46,912
You didn't deserve that and they are all in government

642
00:34:47,424 --> 00:34:49,472
Yeah they are all advising the

643
00:34:49,728 --> 00:34:50,240
The f****** president's

644
00:34:50,496 --> 00:34:53,824
Alright buddy

645
00:34:54,336 --> 00:34:56,128
You got you through some meat on my plate and

646
00:34:56,384 --> 00:34:58,432
It's been awhile since

647
00:35:00,736 --> 00:35:01,760
He talked about it for now

648
00:35:02,272 --> 00:35:04,320
He talks about vaccines for a f****** hour

649
00:35:04,576 --> 00:35:10,464
It's almost unheard of for an hour

650
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:11,232
Trump

651
00:35:11,488 --> 00:35:12,512
He's talking about them

652
00:35:13,024 --> 00:35:14,304
In reference to

653
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:15,584
His globalist

654
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:16,352
Enemies

655
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:19,168
Not defending Trump by attacking them

656
00:35:19,424 --> 00:35:21,984
Attacking them for the sake of attacking them

657
00:35:22,496 --> 00:35:24,800
Because they're giving you dirty vaccines

658
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:26,592
That's a huge difference

659
00:35:27,104 --> 00:35:28,640
I'm so it doesn't throw in like

660
00:35:28,896 --> 00:35:32,992
And that's why we got it

661
00:35:33,504 --> 00:35:34,272
Nope in fact

662
00:35:34,784 --> 00:35:35,552
Quite the opposite

663
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:38,112
Cover Trump

664
00:35:38,368 --> 00:35:40,928
Rodger Stone like Rodger

665
00:35:41,952 --> 00:35:44,512
Both of them

666
00:35:49,888 --> 00:35:51,424
What's happening in Venezuela

667
00:36:03,968 --> 00:36:06,528
Secret society some and the globalist and

668
00:36:08,832 --> 00:36:11,648
Weather modification because the last 3 years

669
00:36:12,416 --> 00:36:13,952
All the time

670
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:17,536
Holyshit

671
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:23,168
It's just I don't want to cover every facet of everything from Josh

672
00:36:23,424 --> 00:36:24,448
You have though

673
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:30,336
Isn't that nuts

674
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:32,128
Anytime

675
00:36:33,408 --> 00:36:33,920
Alex

676
00:36:34,176 --> 00:36:34,944
You could have stopped

677
00:36:35,456 --> 00:36:37,504
Well

678
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:41,088
She couldn't until Rodger Stone was f****** indicted that's true

679
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:47,744
Now Rodger is an interviewer every step of the way or at the very least he's not listening to Rodger as much about Meredith

680
00:36:48,256 --> 00:36:48,768
There should not cover

681
00:36:49,024 --> 00:36:51,840
More or less

682
00:36:52,096 --> 00:36:53,376
Hard to prove that

683
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:01,568
See how are you and what have you

684
00:37:01,824 --> 00:37:07,968
Highlights

685
00:37:08,224 --> 00:37:09,760
And I believe that by the end of that episode

686
00:37:10,016 --> 00:37:11,808
I still was like I don't think

687
00:37:12,064 --> 00:37:12,832
He's going to stick today

688
00:37:13,344 --> 00:37:15,136
I'm listening to this

689
00:37:16,672 --> 00:37:18,976
You think this is the

690
00:37:19,232 --> 00:37:23,072
This is the soft beginning of him getting off the Trump bandwagon

691
00:37:23,328 --> 00:37:26,656
Because listen to this next clip he's starting to realize

692
00:37:26,912 --> 00:37:27,936
That if they go down

693
00:37:28,448 --> 00:37:31,008
He's going to go down unless something changes

694
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:32,544
He realizes that he's

695
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:33,312
Identity

696
00:37:34,336 --> 00:37:36,640
Intertwined with Rodger Stone

697
00:37:36,896 --> 00:37:38,432
And Donald Trump and that is not

698
00:37:38,688 --> 00:37:43,040
A good position to be in right now because I think Monday

699
00:37:43,296 --> 00:37:46,624
Andy realizes he's going to prison

700
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,672
If you try to distant

701
00:37:48,928 --> 00:37:49,440
Entangle himself

702
00:37:49,952 --> 00:37:50,720
It's very

703
00:37:51,744 --> 00:37:53,792
Way

704
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:56,096
All the goods

705
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:58,912
That Trump has done

706
00:37:59,424 --> 00:38:01,984
Versus the bad things that Trump has done

707
00:38:09,152 --> 00:38:12,736
Nationalism and capitalism

708
00:38:12,992 --> 00:38:14,272
Resurgence

709
00:38:15,808 --> 00:38:18,112
Can be destroyed

710
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:29,376
I'm pulling into poverty

711
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:37,568
He's not

712
00:38:38,848 --> 00:38:42,944
The fact that letting everything be about Trump

713
00:38:46,272 --> 00:38:47,296
To destroy him

714
00:38:49,088 --> 00:38:51,904
Ensenada cripples us

715
00:38:56,256 --> 00:38:57,536
My duty is not Rodger Stone

716
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:01,376
Because I support Rodger

717
00:39:01,888 --> 00:39:04,448
I support President Trump

718
00:39:04,704 --> 00:39:05,728
Frustrated willing

719
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:09,056
But at the same time

720
00:39:15,968 --> 00:39:16,736
Unfortunately

721
00:39:16,992 --> 00:39:17,504
It is

722
00:39:26,208 --> 00:39:31,072
To quote Jojo

723
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:37,984
Suspicious the time in Dubai

724
00:39:38,752 --> 00:39:41,568
After there's trucks up dirty

725
00:39:41,824 --> 00:39:43,104
The dirty ass hoe he had wrought

726
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:45,408
Getting back on track and now he knows like

727
00:39:45,664 --> 00:39:46,688
I can't rely

728
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:51,552
I can't even other elements that

729
00:39:51,808 --> 00:39:52,832
But I think

730
00:39:53,088 --> 00:39:53,600
F*** it

731
00:39:53,856 --> 00:39:54,880
Rodger

732
00:39:56,416 --> 00:40:02,048
My lawyer in even my lawyer thinks you're going to jail

733
00:40:02,816 --> 00:40:06,400
Not anymore Plumbing think about the predicament he's put himself in

734
00:40:06,656 --> 00:40:07,680
Now and I think

735
00:40:07,936 --> 00:40:08,448
It's possible that

736
00:40:08,704 --> 00:40:09,216
He's waking up

737
00:40:09,472 --> 00:40:10,752
From a real life

738
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:12,032
Long Bender like

739
00:40:12,544 --> 00:40:13,056
Your Bender with

740
00:40:13,312 --> 00:40:18,432
Is Trump Boos that he's been drinking his flagging over and over again

741
00:40:18,688 --> 00:40:20,480
And along the way what is done

742
00:40:20,992 --> 00:40:22,272
Like now he has no Rodger

743
00:40:24,576 --> 00:40:30,208
They ought to be able to conspire on Rogers phones probably

744
00:40:31,232 --> 00:40:35,584
Have the same relationship that they had before whatever that relationship might have been

745
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:37,376
But in the process by following

746
00:40:37,632 --> 00:40:39,168
Everything Rodger wanted him to do

747
00:40:39,424 --> 00:40:39,936
Where is he

748
00:40:40,704 --> 00:40:41,216
You can't talk

749
00:40:44,544 --> 00:40:45,568
His world which is

750
00:40:49,152 --> 00:40:51,712
Webster Tarpley has turned on him because

751
00:40:53,248 --> 00:40:54,272
Inspiring fashion

752
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:01,952
Wayne Madsen

753
00:41:02,208 --> 00:41:02,720
The fastest ice

754
00:41:04,256 --> 00:41:05,792
Webster Tarpley

755
00:41:06,816 --> 00:41:08,864
The guy who brought us

756
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:11,168
Call me or call Larry Nichols story

757
00:41:11,424 --> 00:41:13,472
Don't talk to Alex anymore because of the same

758
00:41:17,056 --> 00:41:19,104
Play leftovers

759
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:20,128
The trend

760
00:41:20,384 --> 00:41:22,944
Some of this long-term employees didn't like the direction

761
00:41:23,456 --> 00:41:25,248
Of him getting into trumpets they left

762
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:28,064
People likely in McAdoo doesn't seem to be

763
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:31,136
Like he's lost everything

764
00:41:31,648 --> 00:41:32,416
By following

765
00:41:33,184 --> 00:41:35,488
Rodger Stones advice to the point he's at

766
00:41:35,744 --> 00:41:37,280
And now he realizes

767
00:41:37,792 --> 00:41:41,632
Where am I what have I given up everything for I got David Knight

768
00:41:41,888 --> 00:41:44,704
Owen Shroyer hanging around I got nothing

769
00:41:45,216 --> 00:41:51,360
This sucks I can't imagine reading any historical precedent for what happens if you

770
00:41:51,616 --> 00:41:52,640
Listen to Rodger Stone

771
00:41:52,895 --> 00:41:53,407
Purdue logs

772
00:41:53,663 --> 00:41:55,199
Whoa whoa whoa

773
00:41:55,455 --> 00:41:56,223
Are you staying

774
00:41:58,527 --> 00:41:59,039
For three years

775
00:41:59,295 --> 00:42:00,831
Nothing left

776
00:42:01,087 --> 00:42:04,159
Doesn't happen to everybody

777
00:42:04,671 --> 00:42:05,695
So I am

778
00:42:05,951 --> 00:42:06,719
I found that

779
00:42:09,023 --> 00:42:10,559
To be like I have my own man

780
00:42:10,815 --> 00:42:12,351
I have my own identity isn't

781
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:14,143
Is Rodger Stone

782
00:42:14,911 --> 00:42:15,935
I thought that was fine

783
00:42:16,959 --> 00:42:17,983
I thought was interesting

784
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:19,007
I'm still

785
00:42:19,263 --> 00:42:21,311
Waiting to see where this narrative

786
00:42:21,567 --> 00:42:22,079
Progressed to

787
00:42:24,639 --> 00:42:26,687
Clip and I almost fell out of my f******

788
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:28,223
Because

789
00:42:28,991 --> 00:42:30,271
You listen to our show

790
00:42:30,527 --> 00:42:32,063
About 3 episodes back

791
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:35,135
I said he was going to say almost literally

792
00:42:35,391 --> 00:42:36,159
What he says

793
00:42:37,183 --> 00:42:43,327
Launch 1776 part 2 we launched the global populist movement

794
00:42:44,095 --> 00:42:47,167
Nationalist movement

795
00:42:47,679 --> 00:42:48,447
Globalism

796
00:42:48,703 --> 00:42:51,263
Would become so obviously oppressive authoritarian

797
00:42:51,519 --> 00:42:52,543
That we should promote

798
00:42:52,799 --> 00:42:55,871
It's a nationalistic counterpart

799
00:42:56,127 --> 00:42:57,407
The Detonator

800
00:43:00,479 --> 00:43:01,759
You kind of expect you to say

801
00:43:02,015 --> 00:43:03,039
What is the prelude

802
00:43:03,551 --> 00:43:04,063
To the bomb

803
00:43:06,623 --> 00:43:07,647
Overall

804
00:43:09,439 --> 00:43:10,207
Resistance

805
00:43:12,255 --> 00:43:13,023
That's the point

806
00:43:14,047 --> 00:43:15,839
That I'm making here

807
00:43:16,607 --> 00:43:17,375
Is that

808
00:43:20,703 --> 00:43:24,287
After the party we brought Trump to the party

809
00:43:25,055 --> 00:43:31,199
I literally said that when Alex decides it's going to be

810
00:43:31,455 --> 00:43:35,295
Easy Dodge for him when he's going to say I didn't leave the party Trump left the party

811
00:43:35,551 --> 00:43:39,903
Which is paraphrase

812
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:45,535
I am scared of

813
00:43:45,791 --> 00:43:48,095
Go to Country for a little while

814
00:43:49,631 --> 00:43:52,959
It might be indicative to the you might be listening and we should get it

815
00:43:53,215 --> 00:43:53,727
Consulting fee

816
00:43:56,287 --> 00:44:01,919
Trump didn't bring it to the party

817
00:44:02,687 --> 00:44:03,455
I think it's probably the

818
00:44:03,711 --> 00:44:04,223
Smartest way to do it

819
00:44:05,759 --> 00:44:09,855
I mean the only other way to do it would be to

820
00:44:10,111 --> 00:44:13,439
Betray all of the principles that you've already been

821
00:44:13,695 --> 00:44:14,207
Betrayed

822
00:44:14,719 --> 00:44:16,255
Revealing that you

823
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:18,303
Actually believe

824
00:44:18,815 --> 00:44:19,327
Principles that

825
00:44:19,583 --> 00:44:20,095
Betrayed

826
00:44:20,351 --> 00:44:20,863
For Trump

827
00:44:22,143 --> 00:44:24,447
You'd have to burn down a lot or do with it

828
00:44:24,959 --> 00:44:28,543
Controlled burn

829
00:44:28,799 --> 00:44:30,335
But I think you get away a lot

830
00:44:31,103 --> 00:44:34,175
When you're like

831
00:44:37,247 --> 00:44:39,551
Yeah exactly

832
00:44:39,807 --> 00:44:42,111
Where we got the idea that you might do this from

833
00:44:42,367 --> 00:44:44,159
Yep he co-opted Trump as long as he

834
00:44:46,975 --> 00:44:50,815
Rush like Stone has the same f****** pattern of behavior whenever he

835
00:44:51,071 --> 00:44:52,351
Gets caught in a lie Alex

836
00:44:52,607 --> 00:44:55,935
Alex whenever he needs to cut and run

837
00:44:56,191 --> 00:44:58,239
Alex

838
00:44:58,495 --> 00:45:04,383
I am pretending he was a real version of nobody else the real world

839
00:45:04,639 --> 00:45:08,735
Even though I told all of you at the very beginning

840
00:45:09,759 --> 00:45:11,551
Bright

841
00:45:16,159 --> 00:45:17,951
Bad idea

842
00:45:19,999 --> 00:45:22,303
Doing but he's fighting a gag order

843
00:45:24,863 --> 00:45:25,631
Yep it's mess

844
00:45:25,887 --> 00:45:27,423
Ticketmaster

845
00:45:27,679 --> 00:45:30,239
As much as I hate him and I think he sucks

846
00:45:30,751 --> 00:45:35,615
I think Alex is doing the right thing I don't think it's going to be enough to save him

847
00:45:35,871 --> 00:45:37,151
But I think it's interesting

848
00:45:37,407 --> 00:45:41,759
On one level because

849
00:45:42,015 --> 00:45:43,551
It atleast is

850
00:45:43,807 --> 00:45:44,319
A move

851
00:45:44,831 --> 00:45:47,135
It will have consequences

852
00:45:48,927 --> 00:45:49,439
That's

853
00:45:49,695 --> 00:45:53,279
That's more interesting than just staying the course of letting the whole thing Fall Apart

854
00:45:53,535 --> 00:45:56,351
It's also moved it says discretion is the better part of valor

855
00:45:57,375 --> 00:45:59,167
You know it is next web

856
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:05,567
Alex says that he doesn't think the Trump is going down but the way makes me think that

857
00:46:05,823 --> 00:46:06,335
Is going down

858
00:46:10,687 --> 00:46:14,783
Precision all about Trump is not because I think he's about to be brought down for sure

859
00:46:16,831 --> 00:46:19,903
Demoralizing effect

860
00:46:20,159 --> 00:46:22,975
Because we're on the March

861
00:46:23,231 --> 00:46:25,279
That is pretty

862
00:46:26,815 --> 00:46:28,351
I think Alex is

863
00:46:28,607 --> 00:46:29,119
Concern

864
00:46:29,375 --> 00:46:32,959
So I don't think Trump is going down but I do know

865
00:46:33,215 --> 00:46:34,751
2 people who are going down

866
00:46:36,543 --> 00:46:38,079
I know both of them

867
00:46:41,151 --> 00:46:42,175
The ship that they did

868
00:46:42,687 --> 00:46:44,991
And that Trump was directly involved with that s***

869
00:46:45,503 --> 00:46:46,271
So if

870
00:46:51,903 --> 00:46:55,231
It makes you think that

871
00:46:55,487 --> 00:46:55,999
He might be

872
00:46:56,767 --> 00:46:58,303
I don't I don't know if you

873
00:46:58,559 --> 00:47:02,399
Alex

874
00:47:02,655 --> 00:47:03,167
Velvet

875
00:47:03,679 --> 00:47:04,703
Kind of given up

876
00:47:05,215 --> 00:47:06,495
Like the fact that he

877
00:47:07,263 --> 00:47:08,543
He's doing this at all

878
00:47:08,799 --> 00:47:10,847
Rogers

879
00:47:11,871 --> 00:47:18,015
Specifically

880
00:47:18,271 --> 00:47:20,831
The s*** that course he was involved in as well

881
00:47:21,087 --> 00:47:22,879
He knows both of these

882
00:47:23,391 --> 00:47:24,415
Yep he's

883
00:47:24,671 --> 00:47:26,975
He turned on Coursey because he thought that was a way that

884
00:47:27,231 --> 00:47:28,767
We could maintain Rodger

885
00:47:29,023 --> 00:47:30,815
Rodger got in trouble is like

886
00:47:31,071 --> 00:47:31,839
F*** it I got to change

887
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:36,703
Turn all the s*** head position

888
00:47:36,959 --> 00:47:37,471
He has

889
00:47:37,727 --> 00:47:38,495
In defense of

890
00:47:39,263 --> 00:47:41,311
But they'll do longer be used in services

891
00:47:41,567 --> 00:47:42,079
Defending Trump

892
00:47:44,895 --> 00:47:47,199
Immigrants stop all the transphobia

893
00:47:47,455 --> 00:47:48,223
All that s***

894
00:47:48,479 --> 00:47:50,783
That will all still be there but it'll be

895
00:47:51,295 --> 00:47:52,319
Attacking

896
00:47:52,575 --> 00:47:53,087
As opposed

897
00:47:53,343 --> 00:47:53,855
2

898
00:47:54,111 --> 00:47:55,903
You know

899
00:47:59,999 --> 00:48:01,535
Well thank God he still got Paul Joseph

900
00:48:08,447 --> 00:48:09,727
Back into his TED Talk

901
00:48:09,983 --> 00:48:10,751
About vaccines

902
00:48:11,263 --> 00:48:11,775
Aunt

903
00:48:12,031 --> 00:48:15,359
Some of this is a little bit to reiterating what he said before but

904
00:48:16,639 --> 00:48:18,943
Repeatedly

905
00:48:19,455 --> 00:48:20,991
I'm talking about vaccines

906
00:48:24,063 --> 00:48:27,647
For the government mandating

907
00:48:28,159 --> 00:48:29,183
Nope

908
00:48:29,439 --> 00:48:30,975
Azure

909
00:48:31,231 --> 00:48:33,023
Viruses or

910
00:48:36,863 --> 00:48:39,679
That's a no technology

911
00:48:39,935 --> 00:48:41,471
Have some attributes

912
00:48:44,543 --> 00:48:46,079
To put things into your body

913
00:48:48,639 --> 00:48:50,943
Not just

914
00:48:51,199 --> 00:48:53,503
Autoimmune system but your brain

915
00:48:53,759 --> 00:48:54,783
And your organs

916
00:48:55,039 --> 00:48:56,063
Itself

917
00:49:00,159 --> 00:49:01,183
Vaccinate

918
00:49:03,487 --> 00:49:06,815
Pathogenic diseases

919
00:49:10,143 --> 00:49:12,191
If you would like to leave the influx has

920
00:49:12,703 --> 00:49:13,983
Suvarna just a little bit

921
00:49:14,239 --> 00:49:14,751
White nationalist

922
00:49:15,263 --> 00:49:18,079
The push the people are making is not so much about arresting p

923
00:49:18,335 --> 00:49:21,663
People who are anti vaccinations I believe the conversations are more about

924
00:49:22,431 --> 00:49:24,991
You know charging people with malpractice

925
00:49:25,247 --> 00:49:29,343
Locate not vaccinated yeah

926
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:30,111
The kid gets me though

927
00:49:31,135 --> 00:49:33,439
God forbid some other condition that's worse

928
00:49:33,695 --> 00:49:36,255
A really interesting

929
00:49:36,767 --> 00:49:37,535
Court case

930
00:49:39,327 --> 00:49:41,631
I'd look a you know what my kid got measles

931
00:49:42,655 --> 00:49:43,423
And that is

932
00:49:43,679 --> 00:49:45,215
We traced back the

933
00:49:45,471 --> 00:49:46,751
The outbreak of measles

934
00:49:47,263 --> 00:49:47,775
When it comes back

935
00:49:48,031 --> 00:49:49,311
To your anti-vax

936
00:49:49,567 --> 00:49:50,079
Your b*******

937
00:49:50,847 --> 00:49:51,359
Is that

938
00:49:51,615 --> 00:49:52,895
Grounds for a civil case

939
00:49:53,407 --> 00:49:56,735
Yeah I don't know I don't know

940
00:49:56,991 --> 00:50:01,087
Like vaccines are just like anything they put in your body

941
00:50:01,855 --> 00:50:03,647
What have you some of that defense

942
00:50:03,903 --> 00:50:04,927
Is based on this next clip

943
00:50:05,439 --> 00:50:06,719
And I think he doesn't know what

944
00:50:07,231 --> 00:50:07,743
He's talking about

945
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:17,471
Just about the different types of so-called vaccines

946
00:50:17,983 --> 00:50:20,287
Temperature genetically-engineered virus

947
00:50:21,055 --> 00:50:23,615
Target shirt and shelf

948
00:50:25,919 --> 00:50:28,991
The body

949
00:50:30,271 --> 00:50:35,647
That would have been in your body

950
00:50:36,415 --> 00:50:38,719
So I think what are you talkin about here

951
00:50:40,255 --> 00:50:40,767
Just

952
00:50:41,535 --> 00:50:45,631
Development of medications like in the research

953
00:50:45,887 --> 00:50:46,655
Trial phases

954
00:50:50,239 --> 00:50:53,823
One big example of that is when they were developing the zika vaccine research

955
00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:55,615
They were working on

956
00:50:55,871 --> 00:50:57,919
Also showed a bunch of promise

957
00:50:58,175 --> 00:51:01,503
In the treatment of glioblastoma brain cancer

958
00:51:01,759 --> 00:51:04,063
Until they started to pursue the possibility of this Taxi

959
00:51:04,831 --> 00:51:05,343
Used to fight Frankie

960
00:51:06,111 --> 00:51:08,927
I'm not a scientist I don't really know if I can speak

961
00:51:09,183 --> 00:51:09,695
To a lot of

962
00:51:09,951 --> 00:51:10,719
In-depth in the

963
00:51:11,231 --> 00:51:12,255
Aspects of that

964
00:51:12,511 --> 00:51:14,047
But from everything I've been able to look into

965
00:51:14,303 --> 00:51:15,327
I think that that's what Alex

966
00:51:15,583 --> 00:51:16,095
Misrepresent

967
00:51:16,607 --> 00:51:17,887
The idea that some vaccines

968
00:51:18,143 --> 00:51:19,167
End up having

969
00:51:19,423 --> 00:51:20,191
Dual-purpose

970
00:51:23,263 --> 00:51:24,799
Is also sold as a smoking stuff

971
00:51:27,871 --> 00:51:28,383
It's not

972
00:51:28,895 --> 00:51:31,455
It's very common the scientist

973
00:51:31,711 --> 00:51:32,479
Who are working on it

974
00:51:33,503 --> 00:51:34,015
Work on it

975
00:51:34,271 --> 00:51:36,575
And they find that it helps that

976
00:51:36,831 --> 00:51:38,367
Another like

977
00:51:39,135 --> 00:51:39,647
F*** it

978
00:51:40,159 --> 00:51:41,183
Let's do a memo

979
00:51:41,439 --> 00:51:44,511
Give them different names

980
00:51:45,023 --> 00:51:45,535
Stop

981
00:51:46,303 --> 00:51:47,327
Solve one problem

982
00:51:49,887 --> 00:51:50,655
I'm sure it's all good

983
00:51:50,911 --> 00:51:51,423
That's not what this

984
00:51:52,191 --> 00:51:56,287
We're golden

985
00:51:57,311 --> 00:51:57,823
So

986
00:51:58,079 --> 00:51:58,591
Suck

987
00:52:00,383 --> 00:52:01,407
Lot of pivot

988
00:52:01,919 --> 00:52:02,943
Law of

989
00:52:03,711 --> 00:52:04,223
Falada

990
00:52:04,479 --> 00:52:04,991
I need money

991
00:52:05,503 --> 00:52:06,271
Kind of stuff yeah

992
00:52:06,527 --> 00:52:08,575
The feeling is super different

993
00:52:09,343 --> 00:52:10,111
Super different

994
00:52:10,879 --> 00:52:12,159
In this next clip Alex

995
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:13,183
Suggest

996
00:52:13,439 --> 00:52:14,463
He's not plugging enough

997
00:52:14,975 --> 00:52:16,255
Find me say he was plugging plenty

998
00:52:16,511 --> 00:52:17,791
But he thinks he's not plugging in

999
00:52:18,303 --> 00:52:18,815
But the reason

1000
00:52:19,839 --> 00:52:20,351
Surprising

1001
00:52:25,983 --> 00:52:32,127
AAA Auto plugging up supports and I want to shut down

1002
00:52:32,383 --> 00:52:33,407
Operation

1003
00:52:33,663 --> 00:52:35,967
Infowarsstore.com today

1004
00:52:36,479 --> 00:52:40,063
I needed to check out all the amazing products

1005
00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:44,159
The things you say don't take

1006
00:52:46,207 --> 00:52:48,511
I want to quit so don't plug enough

1007
00:52:48,767 --> 00:52:49,791
All the f****** time

1008
00:52:50,047 --> 00:52:51,071
But it is interesting

1009
00:52:51,327 --> 00:52:53,887
It's an interesting angle because I think he's trying to guilt the audience

1010
00:52:54,143 --> 00:52:57,727
Yeah I think that's essential crisis in more like a

1011
00:52:58,495 --> 00:53:00,287
You got to make me be into this

1012
00:53:00,543 --> 00:53:05,663
Because everything is falling around apart around me everything's falling apart

1013
00:53:05,919 --> 00:53:06,943
Yeah it is

1014
00:53:07,199 --> 00:53:07,711
Kind of like

1015
00:53:07,967 --> 00:53:09,503
Subconsciously he's saying

1016
00:53:10,271 --> 00:53:11,295
Subconsciously

1017
00:53:11,551 --> 00:53:12,319
Wants to quit

1018
00:53:12,831 --> 00:53:13,599
Consciously

1019
00:53:14,111 --> 00:53:18,463
He kind of wants to quit and subconsciously still further he thinks he's already done

1020
00:53:18,719 --> 00:53:20,255
Well quit

1021
00:53:20,511 --> 00:53:21,535
Talking about Trump

1022
00:53:21,791 --> 00:53:27,423
All the time for sure almost fatalistic

1023
00:53:27,679 --> 00:53:28,191
Elementary

1024
00:53:28,447 --> 00:53:28,959
Of his

1025
00:53:29,215 --> 00:53:30,495
His performance over the last

1026
00:53:31,007 --> 00:53:33,567
Month like it just like he does

1027
00:53:33,823 --> 00:53:36,383
If you take what you saying there are literally

1028
00:53:36,895 --> 00:53:39,967
It is kind of I don't want to do the show I've been doing

1029
00:53:40,223 --> 00:53:44,575
But I'm more than willing to do a show where I talk about vaccines for a f****** 2 hours

1030
00:53:46,367 --> 00:53:48,159
Hibbetts The Narrative it h to

1031
00:53:48,415 --> 00:53:51,231
What's the difference

1032
00:53:51,487 --> 00:53:55,071
Totally willing to do that that would be exciting again

1033
00:53:55,327 --> 00:53:56,863
Yeah I bet you feel alive all over again

1034
00:53:57,375 --> 00:53:57,887
We could shave that soup

1035
00:53:58,143 --> 00:53:58,655
Beard

1036
00:53:58,911 --> 00:53:59,423
And I like

1037
00:54:00,191 --> 00:54:00,703
Be alive

1038
00:54:01,215 --> 00:54:05,055
Again really feel like he's fighting these fake enemies but he's got as opposed to

1039
00:54:05,311 --> 00:54:06,591
Is playing defense for a dick

1040
00:54:07,103 --> 00:54:08,127
But doesn't probably even talk to him

1041
00:54:08,895 --> 00:54:11,967
Oh absolutely doesn't that is probably

1042
00:54:12,223 --> 00:54:13,759
Like a leftover feeling video

1043
00:54:14,015 --> 00:54:14,783
He has from the last

1044
00:54:15,039 --> 00:54:16,319
Mumps

1045
00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:20,415
Maybe subconsciously I haven't been super into it

1046
00:54:20,671 --> 00:54:24,511
Because I wake up every morning and I've got a lie for the president

1047
00:54:25,535 --> 00:54:30,399
The president's friend no

1048
00:54:30,655 --> 00:54:36,799
Not getting paid that much intro to every present-day episode weave

1049
00:54:37,823 --> 00:54:38,591
Three months

1050
00:54:38,847 --> 00:54:41,151
I don't want to do this this is really boring

1051
00:54:41,407 --> 00:54:46,527
I don't find the present-day interesting.

1052
00:54:46,783 --> 00:54:52,927
Go back

1053
00:54:54,463 --> 00:54:56,767
Could be could be

1054
00:54:59,071 --> 00:55:00,607
You know they're evil

1055
00:55:00,863 --> 00:55:01,887
Plan

1056
00:55:02,399 --> 00:55:02,911
Play

1057
00:55:04,703 --> 00:55:08,799
Is you might think that the plan is just get you sick with these various things

1058
00:55:09,055 --> 00:55:09,823
But no no no

1059
00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:13,663
The plan that the globalists have it much cheaper and envy

1060
00:55:13,919 --> 00:55:14,943
Next clip

1061
00:55:15,711 --> 00:55:16,991
It's 40 seconds

1062
00:55:17,503 --> 00:55:19,295
An Alex bats for the bigotry cycle

1063
00:55:19,807 --> 00:55:21,855
Everyday

1064
00:55:22,111 --> 00:55:23,135
It's cold right now

1065
00:55:24,159 --> 00:55:29,791
Run for life and run for autism

1066
00:55:34,399 --> 00:55:36,959
We just get used to half of our boys.

1067
00:55:37,983 --> 00:55:38,751
At the shop kill

1068
00:55:47,711 --> 00:55:50,527
Hormone blockers

1069
00:55:50,783 --> 00:55:56,671
Killem

1070
00:55:57,183 --> 00:55:59,487
All those great Muslims

1071
00:56:01,279 --> 00:56:02,047
It's out of

1072
00:56:02,303 --> 00:56:06,911
Military

1073
00:56:07,167 --> 00:56:10,239
I don't think that I don't see the plan

1074
00:56:10,495 --> 00:56:11,775
Wow

1075
00:56:12,287 --> 00:56:18,431
Buckshot bigotry there at the wall

1076
00:56:18,687 --> 00:56:24,831
Double dribble

1077
00:56:25,087 --> 00:56:27,391
You're going to do a run for autism but you don't really know

1078
00:56:36,863 --> 00:56:39,423
Triple

1079
00:56:39,679 --> 00:56:41,215
But just how we're going to bring it home

1080
00:56:43,519 --> 00:56:47,359
Going to replace the boys who can't talk anymore with his great

1081
00:56:47,871 --> 00:56:49,151
What the f*** man

1082
00:56:52,479 --> 00:56:55,295
I heard that click but I just sitting here like

1083
00:56:56,831 --> 00:56:59,135
I get what he's trying to say but it's so

1084
00:57:00,415 --> 00:57:02,207
Yeah

1085
00:57:03,487 --> 00:57:04,511
That is a world

1086
00:57:04,767 --> 00:57:06,815
Now

1087
00:57:09,119 --> 00:57:11,679
It's all over the place is thoughts are tangential at best

1088
00:57:14,495 --> 00:57:15,519
Have the first hour

1089
00:57:16,031 --> 00:57:18,591
I would say 85 90% of that

1090
00:57:18,847 --> 00:57:20,127
F****** vaccine talk

1091
00:57:20,383 --> 00:57:26,527
Brought out the parts that are that are like interesting and we have it cover

1092
00:57:26,783 --> 00:57:27,551
A bird before

1093
00:57:27,807 --> 00:57:28,319
The other

1094
00:57:28,575 --> 00:57:29,343
Immunotek

1095
00:57:29,599 --> 00:57:30,879
15% is that

1096
00:57:31,135 --> 00:57:32,927
I don't want to just talk about Trump anymore

1097
00:57:33,439 --> 00:57:34,207
The thing that

1098
00:57:34,463 --> 00:57:38,815
Made me so angry whenever he opened

1099
00:57:39,327 --> 00:57:43,935
All these viruses and

1100
00:57:45,215 --> 00:57:50,847
Because I thought

1101
00:57:51,103 --> 00:57:54,943
You get back to the thought in a little bit cuz actually a really interesting places

1102
00:57:55,199 --> 00:57:58,783
He's getting those ideas

1103
00:57:59,039 --> 00:57:59,551
Understand

1104
00:58:01,855 --> 00:58:03,135
And I apologized

1105
00:58:03,903 --> 00:58:07,487
But I do so because he's going to articulate a backbiter

1106
00:58:09,279 --> 00:58:10,559
First hour it's pretty much

1107
00:58:10,815 --> 00:58:11,327
Vaccine

1108
00:58:11,583 --> 00:58:12,351
And a little bit of

1109
00:58:12,607 --> 00:58:15,167
I don't want to just be tied to these guys

1110
00:58:16,447 --> 00:58:19,007
I don't want to do that I want to keep making money

1111
00:58:19,519 --> 00:58:20,031
So

1112
00:58:20,287 --> 00:58:22,591
The second hour starts on a bike

1113
00:58:23,103 --> 00:58:23,871
You can't keep talking

1114
00:58:24,895 --> 00:58:25,919
But he does

1115
00:58:26,175 --> 00:58:27,967
Because there's break

1116
00:58:28,479 --> 00:58:28,991
But he's found

1117
00:58:30,015 --> 00:58:31,039
Involves vaccine

1118
00:58:32,831 --> 00:58:33,599
The Mueller probe

1119
00:58:34,367 --> 00:58:34,879
What

1120
00:58:35,903 --> 00:58:37,695
Where's the connection there

1121
00:58:37,951 --> 00:58:39,999
Very same people that have had their

1122
00:58:41,023 --> 00:58:42,047
Fingers controlling

1123
00:58:50,239 --> 00:58:51,263
None of them

1124
00:58:55,103 --> 00:58:55,871
Guarantee

1125
00:58:57,407 --> 00:58:58,431
Robert Mueller

1126
00:59:03,039 --> 00:59:05,343
Star General

1127
00:59:05,599 --> 00:59:07,903
But you know what your son or daughter in the military does

1128
00:59:08,159 --> 00:59:14,303
Weather in Toronto for kid to cuz they like to walk around and see your lower IQ and do all those cancer viruses

1129
00:59:14,559 --> 00:59:20,703
Congress

1130
00:59:20,959 --> 00:59:27,103
Spider

1131
00:59:35,295 --> 00:59:37,343
Rosenstein

1132
00:59:37,599 --> 00:59:39,135
Is somehow giving you vexed

1133
00:59:43,999 --> 00:59:47,327
Why Alex is starting to cook with gas

1134
00:59:50,143 --> 00:59:55,263
If Alex went on vacation to the Amazon

1135
00:59:55,519 --> 00:59:58,079
He'll be taking my malaria pills for

1136
00:59:58,335 --> 01:00:02,687
Yeah but do you understand you see what's going on just subtle Difference In that clip

1137
01:00:02,943 --> 01:00:04,223
As opposed to it being

1138
01:00:04,479 --> 01:00:08,063
Using his narrative years

1139
01:00:08,319 --> 01:00:08,831
Help

1140
01:00:09,087 --> 01:00:09,599
Defend Trump

1141
01:00:10,111 --> 01:00:11,391
Using this invest

1142
01:00:11,647 --> 01:00:12,159
Allegation of trump

1143
01:00:12,415 --> 01:00:15,231
How to inform and enforce his vaccine narrative

1144
01:00:15,487 --> 01:00:17,023
What is taking the path

1145
01:00:17,279 --> 01:00:18,047
It's the same street

1146
01:00:18,303 --> 01:00:20,095
But going the opposite direction down it

1147
01:00:20,351 --> 01:00:21,631
Which is I think

1148
01:00:21,887 --> 01:00:24,447
Importance

1149
01:00:25,983 --> 01:00:26,751
People trying to

1150
01:00:27,007 --> 01:00:27,519
Destroyed

1151
01:00:27,775 --> 01:00:29,567
Trunk from the inside

1152
01:00:29,823 --> 01:00:31,615
He's going from this like

1153
01:00:32,127 --> 01:00:33,151
There there

1154
01:00:33,407 --> 01:00:34,943
They're doing it not just

1155
01:00:35,199 --> 01:00:35,967
To destroy Trump

1156
01:00:36,223 --> 01:00:37,247
To destroy all of you

1157
01:00:37,503 --> 01:00:43,647
And who gives a s*** if Trump gets destroyed because they're still there giving you all those

1158
01:00:43,903 --> 01:00:45,439
Where is before primary

1159
01:00:46,719 --> 01:00:48,511
Define point but I think it's important

1160
01:00:48,767 --> 01:00:50,047
Considered in the large

1161
01:00:50,559 --> 01:00:51,839
All the things that you saying

1162
01:00:52,095 --> 01:00:57,471
The slight important variations of his narrative

1163
01:00:57,727 --> 01:00:59,007
Be very easy to miss

1164
01:00:59,263 --> 01:00:59,775
If you didn't spend

1165
01:01:05,919 --> 01:01:07,711
My bad

1166
01:01:07,967 --> 01:01:12,831
So Rod Rosenstein

1167
01:01:13,087 --> 01:01:15,647
He's doing this to us in the back seats that's wild

1168
01:01:15,903 --> 01:01:16,671
But

1169
01:01:17,695 --> 01:01:19,231
Pacific I didn't understand without

1170
01:01:19,743 --> 01:01:22,559
Doesn't it kind of suggested that sessions was doing it

1171
01:01:22,815 --> 01:01:23,839
First since

1172
01:01:24,095 --> 01:01:25,887
Robert Rosenthal

1173
01:01:26,143 --> 01:01:27,167
Roses

1174
01:01:27,423 --> 01:01:30,495
15 was the deputy Attorney General

1175
01:01:30,751 --> 01:01:33,311
Mueller probe was set up

1176
01:01:34,335 --> 01:01:35,103
Long ago

1177
01:01:35,359 --> 01:01:41,503
Worst evil

1178
01:01:41,759 --> 01:01:42,271
Like Alex

1179
01:01:42,527 --> 01:01:46,879
February

1180
01:01:47,135 --> 01:01:48,671
Sessions was the first guy

1181
01:01:48,927 --> 01:01:50,207
That Alex loves

1182
01:01:50,463 --> 01:01:54,559
In the Trump Administration

1183
01:01:54,815 --> 01:01:56,351
And that's why.

1184
01:01:56,607 --> 01:01:59,935
Even then how it was still a little bit on the fence about it

1185
01:02:01,983 --> 01:02:03,007
Rodger

1186
01:02:03,519 --> 01:02:04,031
That

1187
01:02:07,871 --> 01:02:09,151
Love Jeff sessions

1188
01:02:09,663 --> 01:02:13,759
In the 2014 2015

1189
01:02:14,015 --> 01:02:17,087
All the betrayals all of the cutting people loose

1190
01:02:17,343 --> 01:02:18,367
It's happening Alex's life

1191
01:02:18,623 --> 01:02:19,903
Cause of Rodger Stone

1192
01:02:20,159 --> 01:02:22,207
It's now it's so interesting

1193
01:02:22,463 --> 01:02:24,511
To look at I know that I've already brought up all those names

1194
01:02:26,815 --> 01:02:27,583
That are left of Alex

1195
01:02:29,119 --> 01:02:30,911
It's ironic

1196
01:02:31,167 --> 01:02:31,679
He's pulling

1197
01:02:31,935 --> 01:02:33,471
Midnight Massacre

1198
01:02:33,727 --> 01:02:35,519
The guy who works

1199
01:02:35,775 --> 01:02:36,287
In love

1200
01:02:37,311 --> 01:02:37,823
Is going to be

1201
01:02:38,591 --> 01:02:42,431
Weird I didn't know what he was talking about about Rosenstein

1202
01:02:42,687 --> 01:02:44,735
Because I have like I have no idea what can I say

1203
01:02:47,807 --> 01:02:52,159
General seti was vaccinated

1204
01:02:52,415 --> 01:02:52,927
He got his ex

1205
01:02:53,183 --> 01:02:54,719
He's growing up so in this next clip

1206
01:02:54,975 --> 01:02:56,511
Out

1207
01:02:57,023 --> 01:02:59,583
Man this is week

1208
01:03:03,167 --> 01:03:06,239
It's over the vaccine damage Court

1209
01:03:09,055 --> 01:03:10,847
It's not

1210
01:03:16,223 --> 01:03:18,783
Lawsuits and other courts

1211
01:03:19,551 --> 01:03:21,087
Goodnight called arbitration

1212
01:03:21,599 --> 01:03:27,743
Liability protection unless it's in a sovereign immunity strip

1213
01:03:28,255 --> 01:03:31,839
Sovereign immunity of the US government issue

1214
01:03:35,167 --> 01:03:36,959
You got to go through 4 years

1215
01:03:56,415 --> 01:03:57,183
You're doing great work

1216
01:03:57,439 --> 01:03:59,743
Rosenstein sister

1217
01:04:01,279 --> 01:04:03,327
Search for Children's Program

1218
01:04:03,583 --> 01:04:04,863
At the CDC

1219
01:04:07,167 --> 01:04:08,703
So

1220
01:04:10,239 --> 01:04:10,751
Guns

1221
01:04:11,263 --> 01:04:14,847
Rod Rosenstein

1222
01:04:15,103 --> 01:04:17,407
Dr. Nancy messonnier

1223
01:04:17,663 --> 01:04:20,735
That's probably

1224
01:04:25,087 --> 01:04:28,159
That she's in charge or has anything to do with

1225
01:04:28,415 --> 01:04:28,927
Green quartz

1226
01:04:30,975 --> 01:04:31,487
She does not

1227
01:04:31,743 --> 01:04:35,839
In that clip we just heard Alex just reading a tweet posted by Alan root

1228
01:04:36,095 --> 01:04:36,863
It would you links to us

1229
01:04:37,119 --> 01:04:40,191
CDC website about the vaccines for children program

1230
01:04:40,447 --> 01:04:41,983
Which is part of the cdc's mission

1231
01:04:42,239 --> 01:04:43,007
Provide

1232
01:04:43,263 --> 01:04:44,543
Children in low-income family

1233
01:04:45,055 --> 01:04:50,687
This page in no way proves that Rosenstein sister is in charge of this program

1234
01:04:50,943 --> 01:04:51,967
It's entirely possible

1235
01:04:52,223 --> 01:04:54,015
Butts

1236
01:04:54,271 --> 01:04:59,135
Important point out that the vaccines for children program has literally nothing to do with the vaccine Court

1237
01:04:59,647 --> 01:05:05,791
Also fun fact Wayne Allyn root is a con man who wrote a book in 1989 about how to make money

1238
01:05:06,047 --> 01:05:08,863
2004

1239
01:05:10,911 --> 01:05:11,423
Gambling

1240
01:05:11,679 --> 01:05:13,215
After Obama was elected he took his

1241
01:05:13,471 --> 01:05:17,311
Is grifter the political world and started writing about how Obama wasn't

1242
01:05:17,823 --> 01:05:19,871
It was a secret Marxist Muslim

1243
01:05:20,639 --> 01:05:22,175
He's Simpson doors every horseshit can

1244
01:05:22,431 --> 01:05:24,223
Conspiracy from the Seth rich bulshit

1245
01:05:24,479 --> 01:05:26,015
The Nazis at Charlottesville

1246
01:05:26,271 --> 01:05:28,319
Paid actors

1247
01:05:28,575 --> 01:05:31,647
He also recently claimed that Mueller's investigation into Trump

1248
01:05:32,159 --> 01:05:34,207
Happening because mother has a small dick

1249
01:05:34,463 --> 01:05:35,743
And he's jealous

1250
01:05:35,999 --> 01:05:36,767
Trump's very large

1251
01:05:38,815 --> 01:05:39,839
Route is a

1252
01:05:40,095 --> 01:05:40,607
Sucking it

1253
01:05:41,119 --> 01:05:46,495
Reading at I know more about Trump stick that I do

1254
01:05:47,007 --> 01:05:49,055
I would prefer that iced item

1255
01:05:49,311 --> 01:05:51,103
Want to know anything about Mueller sick either

1256
01:05:51,359 --> 01:05:56,991
Right let's Let It Go

1257
01:05:57,247 --> 01:06:02,111
That links to the CDC paid for the vaccines for children program

1258
01:06:02,367 --> 01:06:06,975
The vaccine Court issue at all he doesn't have a story about this

1259
01:06:07,231 --> 01:06:08,511
He doesn't have any reporting

1260
01:06:08,767 --> 01:06:11,071
And it's word for word he's literally reading this

1261
01:06:11,327 --> 01:06:12,351
Yeah

1262
01:06:13,631 --> 01:06:18,495
Is the director for the national Center for immunization and rest

1263
01:06:18,751 --> 01:06:19,519
Pretoria diseases

1264
01:06:19,775 --> 01:06:22,079
Which is a branch of the Centers for Disease Control

1265
01:06:22,591 --> 01:06:26,943
Enter time there's you provided support and Leadership towards a lot of initiatives take care of preventable

1266
01:06:27,199 --> 01:06:28,223
Preventable diseases

1267
01:06:28,479 --> 01:06:29,247
In the third world

1268
01:06:29,503 --> 01:06:33,599
And has recently been on the Forefront of working of rising

1269
01:06:33,855 --> 01:06:34,623
Incidence

1270
01:06:34,879 --> 01:06:36,671
Acute flaccid myelitis

1271
01:06:36,927 --> 01:06:38,207
Yeah the condition

1272
01:06:38,463 --> 01:06:44,607
It's similar to polio but with no evidence

1273
01:06:46,143 --> 01:06:47,423
The vaccine Court

1274
01:06:47,679 --> 01:06:51,263
Just talkin about or the national vaccine injury Compensation Program

1275
01:06:51,775 --> 01:06:54,591
Was created under the umbrella of the Department of Health and Human Service

1276
01:06:55,103 --> 01:06:56,639
Department that contains

1277
01:06:57,407 --> 01:06:58,943
But isn't run by the

1278
01:06:59,967 --> 01:07:02,271
Government departments are off

1279
01:07:02,527 --> 01:07:03,807
Operation

1280
01:07:04,319 --> 01:07:07,647
And just because two things are in the same department at both have to do with vaccine

1281
01:07:07,903 --> 01:07:09,439
Doesn't mean they're run by the same people

1282
01:07:09,951 --> 01:07:14,303
I can find zero evidence

1283
01:07:14,815 --> 01:07:15,327
Is real

1284
01:07:15,583 --> 01:07:18,143
Even if she were involved I can find you a reason

1285
01:07:19,167 --> 01:07:22,751
Hazardous kasireddy the vaccine Court were not established because

1286
01:07:23,007 --> 01:07:25,567
Secret way to sweep dangers of vaccines under the rug

1287
01:07:25,823 --> 01:07:26,591
From public scrutiny

1288
01:07:26,847 --> 01:07:28,383
They were set up to be at to be

1289
01:07:28,895 --> 01:07:29,919
To be better

1290
01:07:30,175 --> 01:07:32,223
To help the subsets of people

1291
01:07:32,479 --> 01:07:32,991
Can we suffer from

1292
01:07:33,247 --> 01:07:34,015
Potential side-effects

1293
01:07:34,271 --> 01:07:35,295
A very important

1294
01:07:36,063 --> 01:07:37,599
They did this. They made it

1295
01:07:37,855 --> 01:07:41,951
Simpler for them to get payments for these these

1296
01:07:42,207 --> 01:07:47,583
Because these families deserve some consideration and payout but they never be able to get them in a real Court

1297
01:07:49,119 --> 01:07:49,631
Absolutely

1298
01:07:50,399 --> 01:07:53,727
To a certain extent side effects are inevitable of pretty much every medication

1299
01:07:54,495 --> 01:07:59,615
Human biology is infinitely complex the prospect of ever releasing a perfectly safe no wrist medicine

1300
01:07:59,871 --> 01:08:00,895
Is impossible

1301
01:08:01,407 --> 01:08:04,223
A study in 2017 showed that take an aspirin daily

1302
01:08:04,991 --> 01:08:08,063
3000 deaths a year mostly due to the blood

1303
01:08:08,831 --> 01:08:10,623
This is the case for whole bunch of medication

1304
01:08:13,183 --> 01:08:17,023
In case of aspirin dramatically reducing the risk of heart attack in older people

1305
01:08:17,279 --> 01:08:22,911
So the goal is to mitigate the risk of the side effect while preserving the benefit of the main purpose of the medication

1306
01:08:23,423 --> 01:08:25,471
This is how people look at vaccines

1307
01:08:26,239 --> 01:08:28,031
No one is saying that they're completely safe

1308
01:08:28,543 --> 01:08:30,591
Just that the incidence of side effects are not

1309
01:08:30,847 --> 01:08:32,127
Commensurate with the benefit

1310
01:08:32,383 --> 01:08:33,407
About not having to deal with

1311
01:08:33,663 --> 01:08:34,943
Extension level threat

1312
01:08:35,199 --> 01:08:36,479
From preventable diseases any

1313
01:08:36,735 --> 01:08:37,759
It's the greater good

1314
01:08:38,271 --> 01:08:44,159
It's not even just a greater good choice

1315
01:08:44,415 --> 01:08:48,511
No no it's not a 5-4 decision like the Supreme Court

1316
01:08:48,767 --> 01:08:52,607
98th division

1317
01:08:55,167 --> 01:08:55,935
First place

1318
01:08:56,959 --> 01:08:57,471
Evidence

1319
01:08:57,727 --> 01:08:58,751
That people give us

1320
01:08:59,775 --> 01:09:00,287
You don't like

1321
01:09:01,567 --> 01:09:06,175
This would never actually win in a way to high

1322
01:09:06,431 --> 01:09:08,223
San Jose

1323
01:09:08,479 --> 01:09:11,039
Do they realize it's inevitable

1324
01:09:11,295 --> 01:09:12,831
Course this is going to happen

1325
01:09:13,343 --> 01:09:15,903
These people do deserve some sort of compass

1326
01:09:16,927 --> 01:09:17,951
Others either week

1327
01:09:18,463 --> 01:09:20,767
Completely abandon them

1328
01:09:21,023 --> 01:09:21,791
Where they will get

1329
01:09:29,215 --> 01:09:29,983
We could create a

1330
01:09:30,239 --> 01:09:32,031
A special thing where it's like we get it

1331
01:09:32,287 --> 01:09:33,055
It sucks

1332
01:09:33,567 --> 01:09:34,591
I hate that

1333
01:09:34,847 --> 01:09:37,151
You I hate that some people get struck by lightning

1334
01:09:37,407 --> 01:09:38,431
But we're here to help

1335
01:09:41,247 --> 01:09:46,879
Never be able to prove that the vaccine question

1336
01:09:47,391 --> 01:09:48,159
Because their child

1337
01:09:49,183 --> 01:09:49,695
So

1338
01:09:49,951 --> 01:09:53,535
They've adjusted the standard of evidence required to success

1339
01:09:54,047 --> 01:09:59,935
All the people who bring cases to the vaccine court all their required to do is present a theory connecting the vaccine to the con

1340
01:10:00,191 --> 01:10:03,519
Show an appropriate approximate timeline

1341
01:10:04,287 --> 01:10:07,103
It show that there's not another plausible biological

1342
01:10:07,359 --> 01:10:08,383
The injury or death happen

1343
01:10:08,895 --> 01:10:11,967
It's a very low standard of proof and it's intentionally that way

1344
01:10:12,223 --> 01:10:14,015
Because they want to support the people who experience

1345
01:10:14,271 --> 01:10:18,111
Possible side effects without forcing them to actually proven scientific causation

1346
01:10:19,647 --> 01:10:24,767
The only other important to point out is that even in this court where the burden of proof is super low

1347
01:10:25,023 --> 01:10:30,143
They generally accept cases where petitioners claimed vaccines cause autism

1348
01:10:30,399 --> 01:10:30,911
Their children

1349
01:10:31,167 --> 01:10:35,007
And it ruled that the theory that makes a causal connection between vaccines and autism

1350
01:10:35,263 --> 01:10:36,031
He's not proven

1351
01:10:36,287 --> 01:10:37,311
And not appropriate in

1352
01:10:37,567 --> 01:10:38,079
The courts

1353
01:10:38,335 --> 01:10:40,383
Even in this world designed to provide relief

1354
01:10:40,895 --> 01:10:41,919
People who been hurt by vaccine

1355
01:10:42,431 --> 01:10:45,247
The argument Alex puts forth doesn't meet their burden

1356
01:10:50,623 --> 01:10:54,975
The cord is overseen by nine members of The Advisory Commission on childhood vaccines

1357
01:10:55,743 --> 01:10:56,767
Three of those members

1358
01:10:57,023 --> 01:11:01,119
Azar from the general requirements at to be legal parent or Guardian

1359
01:11:01,375 --> 01:11:03,679
Of children who have been affected by vaccine side

1360
01:11:04,447 --> 01:11:06,751
3

1361
01:11:07,007 --> 01:11:08,543
Three of the other members must be returned

1362
01:11:09,055 --> 01:11:11,871
With relevant Specialties for the court know they have to have

1363
01:11:12,383 --> 01:11:13,919
Experience in medical

1364
01:11:14,175 --> 01:11:15,711
Gaby Alex Jones

1365
01:11:16,223 --> 01:11:21,855
The health professionals appointed by the Secretary of Health and Human Services were specifically required not to be

1366
01:11:22,111 --> 01:11:26,207
Previous to being on this Advisory Board employees of the US

1367
01:11:26,719 --> 01:11:30,047
A requirement

1368
01:11:30,559 --> 01:11:36,703
These are

1369
01:11:39,007 --> 01:11:39,775
To do with it

1370
01:11:40,031 --> 01:11:45,151
These are the only voting members of the committee that oversees the vaccine Court the director of the national anthem

1371
01:11:46,175 --> 01:11:48,479
The assistant Secretary of Health and Human Services

1372
01:11:48,735 --> 01:11:50,015
The director of the CDC

1373
01:11:50,271 --> 01:11:54,367
And the commissioner of the FDA are non-voting observational members of the

1374
01:11:54,879 --> 01:11:56,415
They can't

1375
01:11:56,671 --> 01:11:57,183
What happened

1376
01:11:57,439 --> 01:11:58,719
But they can be a part of like

1377
01:11:58,975 --> 01:12:02,047
None of those things

1378
01:12:02,303 --> 01:12:02,815
Alex's

1379
01:12:03,071 --> 01:12:03,839
Profound

1380
01:12:04,095 --> 01:12:04,863
Dumb

1381
01:12:05,119 --> 01:12:06,399
And Reporting this base in

1382
01:12:06,655 --> 01:12:08,703
Entirely on a tweet from

1383
01:12:09,215 --> 01:12:09,983
Who gives a s***

1384
01:12:12,543 --> 01:12:18,687
Super nice.

1385
01:12:18,943 --> 01:12:19,967
I just mean the fact that

1386
01:12:20,479 --> 01:12:22,783
Any anybody like rod

1387
01:12:23,039 --> 01:12:24,063
Sister

1388
01:12:24,319 --> 01:12:26,879
Works in the CDC

1389
01:12:27,391 --> 01:12:29,439
Doesn't matter if it

1390
01:12:29,695 --> 01:12:30,975
It has any material effects

1391
01:12:31,231 --> 01:12:33,023
Just like fire

1392
01:12:33,279 --> 01:12:34,047
Eagle

1393
01:12:35,583 --> 01:12:38,655
Fiesta shoot the Moon

1394
01:12:41,215 --> 01:12:41,983
But she's there

1395
01:12:43,263 --> 01:12:45,311
But I honestly think the reason

1396
01:12:45,567 --> 01:12:48,895
He's going too far with this and swinging a little too hard is that

1397
01:12:49,919 --> 01:12:56,063
He's getting back into yeah that's like working working that muscle

1398
01:12:57,343 --> 01:12:58,367
All that stuff like

1399
01:12:58,623 --> 01:13:01,951
He doesn't do that much anymore assault

1400
01:13:02,207 --> 01:13:03,743
TV show for a year

1401
01:13:03,999 --> 01:13:08,351
Sage time it's going to take awhile is Rusty

1402
01:13:08,607 --> 01:13:12,191
Qualifications

1403
01:13:13,215 --> 01:13:13,983
If your lawyer

1404
01:13:14,239 --> 01:13:16,031
Has like a medical experience

1405
01:13:16,543 --> 01:13:20,639
If you're a parent of somebody who is the child support affected by vaccine

1406
01:13:20,895 --> 01:13:22,687
Or if you are

1407
01:13:22,943 --> 01:13:25,247
Healthcare professional who doesn't work for the government

1408
01:13:25,503 --> 01:13:27,295
You can apply to be on the advisory Commission

1409
01:13:27,551 --> 01:13:28,063
You can

1410
01:13:28,319 --> 01:13:29,599
I found the application

1411
01:13:29,855 --> 01:13:31,903
In 2 minutes it's super easy

1412
01:13:32,159 --> 01:13:37,535
Commissioner serve three-year terms that might be a little bit of a wait but it's super easy for you to do and I do notice that

1413
01:13:37,791 --> 01:13:38,559
The people who

1414
01:13:38,815 --> 01:13:40,863
In-N-Out complains almost about vaccine

1415
01:13:41,119 --> 01:13:43,423
Never seem to talk about that and I don't think that they're flying

1416
01:13:44,703 --> 01:13:49,567
I think they probably be rejected based on there if you were all three

1417
01:13:50,079 --> 01:13:51,615
Do you just get to be the court

1418
01:13:53,151 --> 01:13:57,247
Do you get to occupy three vote

1419
01:13:57,759 --> 01:14:00,575
Talk about it some more

1420
01:14:01,343 --> 01:14:03,135
Rosenstein

1421
01:14:03,391 --> 01:14:03,903
Mueller

1422
01:14:04,159 --> 01:14:04,927
Mother people

1423
01:14:09,279 --> 01:14:15,423
Billions of dollars

1424
01:14:26,175 --> 01:14:29,503
Roses

1425
01:14:30,271 --> 01:14:31,551
Is going to punish

1426
01:14:31,807 --> 01:14:33,087
Vengeance Belongs to the Lord

1427
01:14:33,599 --> 01:14:37,951
Now you understand the type of proof bottom-feeding spiders were dealing with

1428
01:14:39,487 --> 01:14:41,279
These are going to pack up front

1429
01:14:42,815 --> 01:14:44,351
Lab

1430
01:14:48,959 --> 01:14:51,007
All your tortured then they suck you dry

1431
01:14:51,775 --> 01:14:53,567
A song to you while they doing

01:14:54,335 --> 01:14:55,871
Likespike I'm dumb time

1433
01:14:56,383 --> 01:14:57,663
It's Yum-Yum tight

1434
01:14:58,943 --> 01:15:00,991
I reject a ape look

1435
01:15:01,503 --> 01:15:02,271
Anything from the

1436
01:15:03,039 --> 01:15:06,111
Anything from these people I'm not

1437
01:15:06,367 --> 01:15:07,135
Scientist

1438
01:15:07,391 --> 01:15:08,159
Specialist

1439
01:15:08,415 --> 01:15:09,695
And if there is a

1440
01:15:10,719 --> 01:15:12,255
I would love to have it with the signs

1441
01:15:12,767 --> 01:15:14,047
But for many of these people

1442
01:15:14,303 --> 01:15:17,887
The moment they say the word Gardasil all you are doing is being a misogynist

1443
01:15:20,703 --> 01:15:26,591
Set up a lot of the function of but

1444
01:15:27,871 --> 01:15:29,919
The costume of concern

1445
01:15:32,223 --> 01:15:32,991
I don't want

1446
01:15:34,527 --> 01:15:35,551
That's what Gardasil

1447
01:15:35,807 --> 01:15:37,343
Complained

1448
01:15:37,855 --> 01:15:38,367
Fight

1449
01:15:38,623 --> 01:15:39,135
You

1450
01:15:39,647 --> 01:15:40,415
They're not taking into account

1451
01:15:40,927 --> 01:15:41,439
Spiders

1452
01:15:41,951 --> 01:15:42,463
They sing

1453
01:15:43,487 --> 01:15:46,559
Eddie's yum yum time

Starts talking about others that

Flood levels

1460
01:16:05,759 --> 01:16:08,831
The all these Fighters create a superweapon this tree

Play make

1463
01:16:16,767 --> 01:16:18,815
Yum yum time I didn't know that

1464
01:16:19,071 --> 01:16:19,583
Physically

1465
01:16:19,839 --> 01:16:25,983
Here's what's great about the understand

1466
01:16:26,239 --> 01:16:32,383
Was a real thing

1467
01:16:32,639 --> 01:16:34,431
Web kids

1468
01:16:34,687 --> 01:16:37,503
No idea

1469
01:16:37,759 --> 01:16:40,063
Millions of views on YouTube

1470
01:16:43,391 --> 01:16:45,439
I guarantee that's what's going on

1471
01:16:48,255 --> 01:16:49,791
He's just like I had to watch the

1472
01:16:50,047 --> 01:16:52,607
Security

1473
01:16:53,631 --> 01:16:58,495
Anyway is that Cabela's DoubleDown says that Rosenstein doesn't take vaccines

1474
01:16:58,751 --> 01:17:01,055
He sure of it and we get to that issue

1475
01:17:01,311 --> 01:17:02,335
That. I told you to put it

1476
01:17:02,847 --> 01:17:05,407
Puyallup

1477
01:17:11,551 --> 01:17:13,343
I bet you all the fish in the sea

1478
01:17:14,879 --> 01:17:21,023
Which see mr. Rosenstein the shifter don't take any vaccines

1479
01:17:21,279 --> 01:17:23,583
German Elite

1480
01:17:24,607 --> 01:17:27,679
Communist leaders

1481
01:17:32,287 --> 01:17:34,847
The other things in them

1482
01:17:39,199 --> 01:17:40,991
36 37 years ago

1483
01:17:41,503 --> 01:17:45,855
Person in 30058

1484
01:17:46,367 --> 01:17:48,415
Hold on to some of these ideas

1485
01:17:48,671 --> 01:17:49,695
We'll get to that but

1486
01:17:49,951 --> 01:17:51,743
Really keep in mind

1487
01:17:51,999 --> 01:17:53,023
Couple years ago

1488
01:17:53,279 --> 01:17:54,047
Articles

1489
01:17:54,303 --> 01:17:54,815
About

1490
01:17:57,119 --> 01:17:57,887
Why is that important

1491
01:17:58,655 --> 01:18:02,751
There's no such thing as a clean vaccine

1492
01:18:03,263 --> 01:18:04,543
The idea that such a thing

1493
01:18:04,799 --> 01:18:07,103
Has been pushed for what explicit

1494
01:18:07,359 --> 01:18:08,127
Simplythick

1495
01:18:08,383 --> 01:18:09,919
Other vaccines

1496
01:18:10,175 --> 01:18:11,455
And intentionally dirty

1497
01:18:12,479 --> 01:18:15,551
The concept of a clean vaccine was heavily promoted by bought Army

1498
01:18:15,807 --> 01:18:16,831
Trace the Russian operation

1499
01:18:17,087 --> 01:18:17,855
According to Reuters

1500
01:18:18,111 --> 01:18:22,719
Read quote vaccine

1501
01:18:22,975 --> 01:18:24,511
And what do we normal people get

1502
01:18:25,023 --> 01:18:29,375
The accounts posting both Pro and anti vaxx messages such as those talk

1503
01:18:29,631 --> 01:18:30,399
Vaccine

1504
01:18:31,167 --> 01:18:37,055
Designed to educate

1505
01:18:37,311 --> 01:18:40,639
Which was indicted by Mueller investigation in February 2018

1506
01:18:41,151 --> 01:18:41,663
These messages

1507
01:18:41,919 --> 01:18:42,687
They were putting out

1508
01:18:46,783 --> 01:18:49,343
Of the vaccine

1509
01:18:50,111 --> 01:18:55,487
Were they were during the timeframe that Alex is talking about

1510
01:18:55,743 --> 01:18:59,071
It's almost certain

1511
01:18:59,327 --> 01:19:01,375
That it was a result of this

1512
01:19:03,679 --> 01:19:04,703
Yeah

1513
01:19:04,959 --> 01:19:05,471
Clean vaccines

1514
01:19:06,495 --> 01:19:11,359
So an article from the vaccine reaction had a blog post

1515
01:19:11,615 --> 01:19:12,639
About Mark Zuckerberg getting

1516
01:19:13,919 --> 01:19:17,247
In February 2016 provoked this response from a comment

1517
01:19:17,759 --> 01:19:19,551
What happened to Paul Walker

1518
01:19:20,063 --> 01:19:26,207
The darknet says he found out about vaccine

1519
01:19:26,463 --> 01:19:30,815
Walker picture was he too fast to vaccinate

1520
01:19:31,583 --> 01:19:35,167
So this guy is bringing up dark web

1521
01:19:35,423 --> 01:19:37,727
Responsible for Paul Walker's death

1522
01:19:37,983 --> 01:19:41,311
You get this these are the places that trim soda pops up on the internet

1523
01:19:42,079 --> 01:19:45,151
Whether it's through you know internet research ages

1524
01:19:45,407 --> 01:19:46,943
Sock puppet account

1525
01:19:47,199 --> 01:19:49,503
Or weirdos talking about Paul Walker's

1526
01:19:49,759 --> 01:19:52,575
Conspiracy that emotionally affected by Paul Wall

1527
01:19:53,855 --> 01:19:54,879
And I'm also

1528
01:19:55,647 --> 01:19:59,999
Anti vaxxer really an anti vaxxer how do I combine these two

1529
01:20:01,791 --> 01:20:07,935
What are the intrinsic issues we're going to run into here's that Alex intentionally doesn't ever really say what he thinks a clean vaccine actually

1530
01:20:08,959 --> 01:20:10,239
And a whole bunch of different

1531
01:20:10,495 --> 01:20:11,775
Depending on who you ask

1532
01:20:12,287 --> 01:20:13,824
Clean

1533
01:20:14,080 --> 01:20:18,688
2011 describe the vaccine

1534
01:20:18,944 --> 01:20:20,480
Arizona State University

1535
01:20:20,992 --> 01:20:23,040
The use that term not differentiated

1536
01:20:23,296 --> 01:20:24,576
From other unclean vaccine

1537
01:20:25,088 --> 01:20:26,624
Because they were tempting new procedure

1538
01:20:28,416 --> 01:20:30,976
Salmonella is a quote cargo ship

1539
01:20:31,488 --> 01:20:32,512
The deliver the vaccine

1540
01:20:33,024 --> 01:20:33,536
Priorities

1541
01:20:35,072 --> 01:20:36,352
Salmonella stimulates

1542
01:20:36,608 --> 01:20:37,888
The response from the entire body

1543
01:20:38,144 --> 01:20:38,912
Different

1544
01:20:39,168 --> 01:20:39,936
Different systems

1545
01:20:40,192 --> 01:20:42,240
That other cargo ship

1546
01:20:42,496 --> 01:20:47,104
Listen to

1547
01:20:47,360 --> 01:20:49,920
Complicated

1548
01:20:51,712 --> 01:20:52,736
I do

1549
01:20:55,552 --> 01:20:56,064
Eclectic

1550
01:20:57,088 --> 01:20:57,856
Killing everybody

1551
01:20:59,904 --> 01:21:00,928
And what if we do today

1552
01:21:06,048 --> 01:21:09,888
It was referred to an article about

1553
01:21:12,192 --> 01:21:13,984
Queen or detoxify the salmonella

1554
01:21:14,240 --> 01:21:17,312
Is being used in order to achieve the desired results

1555
01:21:17,568 --> 01:21:22,944
Made it through the further testing phases

1556
01:21:23,200 --> 01:21:24,224
Because it's the exact

1557
01:21:26,016 --> 01:21:27,296
Is what a clean vaccine

1558
01:21:27,808 --> 01:21:29,856
Specifically

1559
01:21:31,136 --> 01:21:31,648
Put the idea push

1560
01:21:32,160 --> 01:21:33,184
And promoted by

1561
01:21:33,440 --> 01:21:33,952
Control Farm

1562
01:21:34,208 --> 01:21:36,000
Which is probably assigned Alex doesn't

1563
01:21:36,256 --> 01:21:37,024
Very deep research

1564
01:21:38,816 --> 01:21:40,864
A lot of a trace back to

1565
01:21:41,120 --> 01:21:41,888
1800

1566
01:21:43,424 --> 01:21:48,800
And people were rightfully concerned about them because

1567
01:21:49,312 --> 01:21:51,616
Bastards

1568
01:21:52,128 --> 01:21:52,640
Newspaper

1569
01:21:52,896 --> 01:21:53,920
Such as this ad from

1570
01:21:54,176 --> 01:21:56,224
Nebraska's Publications the commoner

1571
01:21:56,480 --> 01:21:57,504
4-19-19

1572
01:21:58,016 --> 01:22:03,392
What prophetess your vaccine

1573
01:22:04,160 --> 01:22:09,536
These concerns were legitimate in the late 1800s because many vaccines back then

1574
01:22:10,048 --> 01:22:12,352
And regulating their production was nearly impossible

1575
01:22:12,608 --> 01:22:13,888
So there were way more instant

1576
01:22:14,400 --> 01:22:14,912
Contamination

1577
01:22:15,424 --> 01:22:19,008
Take that mentality from about 100 days ago

1578
01:22:19,264 --> 01:22:20,544
Grab some cowpox

1579
01:22:20,800 --> 01:22:25,664
Put it in my hand and then slap it better than

1580
01:22:25,920 --> 01:22:30,528
About a hundred years ago I'm thinking that you're in the same circumstances

1581
01:22:32,064 --> 01:22:32,832
Only f****** stupid

1582
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:36,928
A 2014 study published by the Journal of biology and Medicine

1583
01:22:37,184 --> 01:22:38,208
Reviews articles in

1584
01:22:38,464 --> 01:22:40,000
Ads about vaccinations and paper

1585
01:22:40,256 --> 01:22:41,280
Brewster 1915

1586
01:22:41,536 --> 01:22:44,096
The 1922 in an attempt to understand

1587
01:22:44,352 --> 01:22:46,144
The phenomenon of vaccine Skeptics

1588
01:22:46,912 --> 01:22:50,752
Where is many people believe that the discredited and retracted Wakefield study

1589
01:22:51,008 --> 01:22:51,520
Don't look back

1590
01:22:51,776 --> 01:22:52,288
Vaccination

1591
01:22:52,544 --> 01:22:53,056
Autism

1592
01:22:53,312 --> 01:22:54,080
They believe it that's been

1593
01:22:54,336 --> 01:22:55,872
Responsible for igniting

1594
01:22:57,152 --> 01:22:59,712
Misguided parents

1595
01:23:00,480 --> 01:23:02,016
The reality is quite different

1596
01:23:02,784 --> 01:23:06,624
Society

1597
01:23:07,136 --> 01:23:10,208
Entirely mirrors the concerns expressed by their predecessors

1598
01:23:10,464 --> 01:23:11,744
In the early

1599
01:23:12,256 --> 01:23:13,536
Because we've evolved so much

1600
01:23:14,048 --> 01:23:14,560
Sure

1601
01:23:14,816 --> 01:23:16,864
The difference is that back then vaccine

1602
01:23:17,120 --> 01:23:18,144
Seems were a new idea

1603
01:23:18,400 --> 01:23:23,520
And everybody intuitively thought it was dumb to give someone a disease to stop them from getting the same disease

1604
01:23:23,776 --> 01:23:24,544
Right of course

1605
01:23:24,800 --> 01:23:28,128
The authors of that study traced down the big commonality

1606
01:23:28,384 --> 01:23:30,432
The characterized vaccine skepticism over the course of

1607
01:23:31,712 --> 01:23:32,992
And found it in both time

1608
01:23:33,504 --> 01:23:34,272
1915

1609
01:23:35,552 --> 01:23:36,576
In the modern time

1610
01:23:36,832 --> 01:23:38,368
It boils down to rhetoric about

1611
01:23:38,624 --> 01:23:39,136
Contamination

1612
01:23:39,648 --> 01:23:40,416
Distrust

1613
01:23:40,672 --> 01:23:41,184
Compulsion

1614
01:23:41,440 --> 01:23:42,720
The idea of being forced to take vaccine

1615
01:23:43,232 --> 01:23:44,000
And locality

1616
01:23:44,256 --> 01:23:45,792
The idea that vaccine Skeptics

1617
01:23:46,048 --> 01:23:46,560
Contempt

1618
01:23:46,816 --> 01:23:47,584
Curry pockets

1619
01:23:47,840 --> 01:23:48,352
Geographically

1620
01:23:49,120 --> 01:23:50,144
All of the ideas

1621
01:23:54,496 --> 01:23:56,032
It's fascinating inside

1622
01:23:56,288 --> 01:23:57,568
To realize that what motivates

1623
01:23:57,824 --> 01:23:58,592
Vaccination

1624
01:23:59,104 --> 01:24:00,128
Rhetoric

1625
01:24:00,384 --> 01:24:01,664
A movement in the present day

1626
01:24:01,920 --> 01:24:03,456
Is legitimately just ignorance

1627
01:24:03,712 --> 01:24:04,992
Of the fact that we haven't

1628
01:24:06,272 --> 01:24:07,040
You stayed the same

1629
01:24:08,320 --> 01:24:12,160
That reminds me so much of the wave it

1630
01:24:12,672 --> 01:24:13,184
Filtrete

1631
01:24:13,696 --> 01:24:14,976
Any kind of

1632
01:24:15,488 --> 01:24:17,280
Climate science

1633
01:24:21,120 --> 01:24:22,400
Scientists agree that

1634
01:24:22,656 --> 01:24:24,192
Climate change is happening

1635
01:24:24,448 --> 01:24:27,008
But you know what 100

1636
01:24:28,544 --> 01:24:29,056
Grieve it

1637
01:24:29,312 --> 01:24:30,080
The Earth

1638
01:24:30,336 --> 01:24:32,384
I was flattered by

1639
01:24:32,640 --> 01:24:33,408
CPAs

1640
01:24:34,432 --> 01:24:34,944
But

1641
01:24:36,224 --> 01:24:37,248
Discount

1642
01:24:37,504 --> 01:24:38,016
Our science

1643
01:24:40,576 --> 01:24:41,600
Like everything has

1644
01:24:42,112 --> 01:24:43,136
Built on the back

1645
01:24:43,648 --> 01:24:44,416
The reason

1646
01:24:45,184 --> 01:24:48,000
What came before informs what comes next

1647
01:24:48,256 --> 01:24:48,768
Silhouette

1648
01:24:50,048 --> 01:24:51,072
Medical science

1649
01:24:52,352 --> 01:24:53,376
Was less

1650
01:24:55,424 --> 01:24:56,448
Based upon a good

1651
01:24:56,704 --> 01:24:58,240
Consensus because there was no

1652
01:24:59,264 --> 01:25:00,288
General standardized

1653
01:25:02,336 --> 01:25:03,616
General standardized

1654
01:25:03,872 --> 01:25:04,640
Idea of how it is

1655
01:25:11,040 --> 01:25:11,552
Is almost

1656
01:25:12,064 --> 01:25:12,576
Salable

1657
01:25:12,832 --> 01:25:13,600
As opposed to

1658
01:25:16,672 --> 01:25:17,184
Again

1659
01:25:17,440 --> 01:25:21,536
Almost unassailable also apart of science

1660
01:25:21,792 --> 01:25:22,304
Right

1661
01:25:22,560 --> 01:25:25,632
A hundred percent that is

1662
01:25:27,168 --> 01:25:28,192
If you read this study

1663
01:25:28,448 --> 01:25:29,984
This research paper

1664
01:25:30,752 --> 01:25:31,776
It's so depressing

1665
01:25:32,032 --> 01:25:32,800
To feed like

1666
01:25:33,312 --> 01:25:37,408
That's cuz you like to imagine that it is all just a movement

1667
01:25:37,664 --> 01:25:39,712
Because of this route

1668
01:25:39,968 --> 01:25:41,760
Of course

1669
01:25:42,528 --> 01:25:45,856
Going on

1670
01:25:48,672 --> 01:25:49,184
It's just

1671
01:25:49,696 --> 01:25:50,720
Intuitive ignorant

1672
01:25:50,976 --> 01:25:52,256
The people reinforce

1673
01:25:52,512 --> 01:25:54,048
With bad

1674
01:25:54,560 --> 01:25:55,072
And terribly large

1675
01:25:57,632 --> 01:25:59,680
It's the protocols of the Elders of Zion

1676
01:25:59,936 --> 01:26:01,216
It's those same narrative

1677
01:26:01,472 --> 01:26:03,776
Popping up over and over and over again with

1678
01:26:04,032 --> 01:26:04,544
Different anime

1679
01:26:05,568 --> 01:26:08,128
Wrong about the idea that diagnosis

1680
01:26:08,384 --> 01:26:09,152
The children

1681
01:26:09,408 --> 01:26:11,456
Spectrum have gone up considerably in the past

1682
01:26:11,712 --> 01:26:12,224
Last year's

1683
01:26:12,480 --> 01:26:12,992
I would guess

1684
01:26:13,248 --> 01:26:17,344
Fudging the numbers a little bit but I don't really care about that because what

1685
01:26:17,600 --> 01:26:19,136
Numbers is far more important

1686
01:26:19,648 --> 01:26:20,416
And that's the misusage

1687
01:26:21,696 --> 01:26:27,328
He's arguing in the number of autism spectrum diagnosis means that more people are on the autism spectrum

1688
01:26:27,840 --> 01:26:30,656
Literally nothing to prove that other than claimed vaccinations

1689
01:26:31,680 --> 01:26:33,216
The problem is he can't prove that

1690
01:26:33,472 --> 01:26:33,984
And no one has

1691
01:26:34,496 --> 01:26:35,520
Despite A Chorus of

1692
01:26:35,776 --> 01:26:38,080
The nihilists pretty well settled at vaccine

1693
01:26:38,592 --> 01:26:39,616
No calls

1694
01:26:39,872 --> 01:26:41,152
Do the onset of ASD

1695
01:26:41,664 --> 01:26:42,432
It's just not

1696
01:26:42,944 --> 01:26:43,712
No one

1697
01:26:44,480 --> 01:26:45,760
There's a simple explanation

1698
01:26:46,016 --> 01:26:47,040
Super Why the rate is going up

1699
01:26:47,296 --> 01:26:47,808
And doctor

1700
01:26:48,064 --> 01:26:49,600
Max Messer

1701
01:26:49,856 --> 01:26:52,160
A pediatric neurologist lays it out very clear

1702
01:26:52,672 --> 01:26:56,256
We're getting better at identifying under identified population

1703
01:26:56,768 --> 01:27:00,864
So it's not as if the numbers are rising it's more that everyone is getting

1704
01:27:01,376 --> 01:27:03,424
Everyone is going to the number that it should be

1705
01:27:04,192 --> 01:27:10,336
One of the things that experts will tell you is that diagnosis are quite recently

1706
01:27:10,592 --> 01:27:11,104
White

1707
01:27:11,616 --> 01:27:14,944
This was something that puzzle doctor so they study the demographic patterns

1708
01:27:15,200 --> 01:27:15,968
I found the quote

1709
01:27:16,224 --> 01:27:21,088
Afd prevalence tends to be higher among residents of neighborhoods where higher socioeconomic status

1710
01:27:21,344 --> 01:27:21,856
Is there

1711
01:27:22,368 --> 01:27:24,928
These residents are more likely to have access to Quality

1712
01:27:26,464 --> 01:27:28,768
Quality Healthcare is a large piece of

1713
01:27:32,096 --> 01:27:37,984
Treated as a child until fairly recently

1714
01:27:38,240 --> 01:27:40,032
If the same behavior manifested

1715
01:27:41,824 --> 01:27:43,872
Greater awareness of these invisible biases

1716
01:27:44,128 --> 01:27:45,152
As well as attempts

1717
01:27:45,408 --> 01:27:47,968
Provide Quality Healthcare for larger numbers of people

1718
01:27:48,224 --> 01:27:50,528
Is natural light to better diagnostic process

1719
01:27:51,040 --> 01:27:54,368
The number of diagonals

1720
01:27:54,624 --> 01:27:56,160
But not necessarily a jump of

1721
01:27:56,416 --> 01:27:56,928
The actual peep

1722
01:27:57,184 --> 01:27:58,208
People who exist on Netflix

1723
01:27:58,464 --> 01:27:59,488
Exactly like

1724
01:27:59,744 --> 01:28:01,280
What is saying is

1725
01:28:02,048 --> 01:28:06,400
So now you say

1726
01:28:09,216 --> 01:28:09,728
Westgate

1727
01:28:09,984 --> 01:28:10,496
White kids

1728
01:28:10,752 --> 01:28:14,336
What is 1 + 58

1729
01:28:19,200 --> 01:28:20,224
Of course

1730
01:28:20,736 --> 01:28:22,784
I mean a lot of that is what is behind

1731
01:28:24,576 --> 01:28:25,600
The shifting numbers

1732
01:28:25,856 --> 01:28:27,392
The perceived increase

1733
01:28:27,648 --> 01:28:28,672
Actually

1734
01:28:28,928 --> 01:28:30,208
You know free from doctors

1735
01:28:33,536 --> 01:28:34,048
It's pretty easy

1736
01:28:37,376 --> 01:28:38,144
And it's not because

1737
01:28:38,656 --> 01:28:43,776
Globalstar poisoning backseat

1738
01:28:44,032 --> 01:28:44,544
Women

1739
01:28:44,800 --> 01:28:45,824
And you go back

1740
01:28:46,080 --> 01:28:46,848
So long

1741
01:28:48,384 --> 01:28:49,152
Well women are

1742
01:28:50,432 --> 01:28:51,712
Like that was always

1743
01:28:51,968 --> 01:28:52,480
Is the diagnosis

1744
01:28:52,992 --> 01:28:53,760
So long as

1745
01:28:56,320 --> 01:28:56,832
Diagnosed

1746
01:28:57,088 --> 01:28:57,856
Male children

1747
01:28:58,112 --> 01:28:58,624
For forever and it's go

1748
01:28:59,136 --> 01:28:59,648
Your

1749
01:29:01,952 --> 01:29:04,000
Like at the end of the day

1750
01:29:04,256 --> 01:29:05,024
Willington

1751
01:29:05,280 --> 01:29:09,120
Sure content with the idea that women are working well or just a problem

1752
01:29:12,448 --> 01:29:13,984
Making the right

1753
01:29:15,008 --> 01:29:16,288
But all of this is to say

1754
01:29:16,544 --> 01:29:17,056
Alex jump

1755
01:29:17,568 --> 01:29:18,336
Headlong

1756
01:29:18,592 --> 01:29:20,384
Back into like

1757
01:29:20,896 --> 01:29:21,408
Early route

1758
01:29:23,200 --> 01:29:24,480
And when I heard him say this

1759
01:29:24,736 --> 01:29:25,248
It made me

1760
01:29:25,760 --> 01:29:26,528
Or convince

1761
01:29:27,040 --> 01:29:27,552
He's Rusty

1762
01:29:27,808 --> 01:29:28,320
People trying to be

1763
01:29:28,576 --> 01:29:29,088
Be himself again

1764
01:29:41,120 --> 01:29:43,680
Because statistically

1765
01:29:46,496 --> 01:29:47,520
Everybody around you

1766
01:29:50,848 --> 01:29:53,408
It's going on right now

1767
01:29:53,920 --> 01:29:54,688
Human target

1768
01:29:58,784 --> 01:29:59,808
Injections

1769
01:30:00,320 --> 01:30:01,344
Injunctions

1770
01:30:09,792 --> 01:30:10,816
Cutting sheep

1771
01:30:11,584 --> 01:30:12,864
Brian Russell

1772
01:30:13,632 --> 01:30:15,680
You got it

1773
01:30:16,448 --> 01:30:17,728
Bertrand Russell

1774
01:30:20,288 --> 01:30:21,568
An injunction

1775
01:30:22,080 --> 01:30:23,104
Bertrand Russell global

1776
01:30:23,360 --> 01:30:25,408
Directions

1777
01:30:26,944 --> 01:30:28,480
Conjunctions the court

1778
01:30:29,760 --> 01:30:31,808
Junction

1779
01:30:32,320 --> 01:30:33,088
We'll make

1780
01:30:33,344 --> 01:30:35,392
The proletariat

1781
01:30:42,304 --> 01:30:44,096
This is old school Alex

1782
01:30:44,864 --> 01:30:47,168
This isn't a fair quote

1783
01:30:47,424 --> 01:30:49,472
Alex's just take the beginning one

1784
01:30:49,728 --> 01:30:52,544
Paraphrase

1785
01:30:52,800 --> 01:30:55,872
Bertrand Russell's

1786
01:30:56,128 --> 01:30:57,664
Aren't you need to serve his purpose

1787
01:30:58,176 --> 01:30:59,200
The full quote is

1788
01:30:59,456 --> 01:30:59,968
Quote

1789
01:31:00,224 --> 01:31:04,064
Gradually by selective breeding the congenital differences between

1790
01:31:04,320 --> 01:31:06,624
Will increase until they become almost different species

1791
01:31:07,136 --> 01:31:07,648
The Revolt of

1792
01:31:07,904 --> 01:31:11,744
Williams would become as Unthinkable as the organized Insurrection of sheep against

1793
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:12,768
The practice of eating

1794
01:31:13,536 --> 01:31:14,560
This has nothing to do with diet

1795
01:31:14,816 --> 01:31:15,840
Injections and injunction

1796
01:31:16,352 --> 01:31:18,144
Those words are found two paragraphs earlier

1797
01:31:18,656 --> 01:31:20,448
Alex could have just use the earlier saying

1798
01:31:23,264 --> 01:31:24,800
Actually remember

1799
01:31:25,568 --> 01:31:27,104
He could have just use the later send

1800
01:31:27,360 --> 01:31:29,664
The word injections

1801
01:31:29,920 --> 01:31:32,480
Which is really what he wants to talk about

1802
01:31:32,736 --> 01:31:34,272
Dusty had to combine the two witches

1803
01:31:34,528 --> 01:31:35,040
Little bit this song

1804
01:31:35,808 --> 01:31:36,832
Although it doesn't matter though

1805
01:31:37,088 --> 01:31:41,184
He's completely twisting Bertrand Russell

1806
01:31:41,696 --> 01:31:44,256
As we discussed when I was brought up is pathogen endgame

1807
01:31:44,768 --> 01:31:50,912
This book is based on lectures to Bertrand Russell gave in the early 1950s

1808
01:31:51,168 --> 01:31:57,312
From his discussion of the horrors that could have befallen the world

1809
01:31:57,568 --> 01:32:00,128
Where to operate on a purely scientific

1810
01:32:00,640 --> 01:32:01,408
Individual rights

1811
01:32:01,920 --> 01:32:04,736
This is explicitly something he does not want to see come to pass

1812
01:32:04,992 --> 01:32:08,576
The context is very very clear if you actually read the books

1813
01:32:08,832 --> 01:32:13,184
We already covered this in-depth so there's no real utility and doing it again Pastor

1814
01:32:13,440 --> 01:32:14,464
Just reminding people that

1815
01:32:14,976 --> 01:32:17,024
But I made a point drawing attention this because

1816
01:32:17,536 --> 01:32:20,352
It's one of so many signs of this episode the old Alex's

1817
01:32:20,608 --> 01:32:24,448
Is waking up for this Trump

1818
01:32:27,008 --> 01:32:29,056
Real baby little other way

1819
01:32:29,312 --> 01:32:31,104
It's more real than he's done

1820
01:32:31,616 --> 01:32:34,944
Other 2018 2019 episodes we've looked at where there's like a

1821
01:32:35,200 --> 01:32:35,712
The flicker

1822
01:32:35,968 --> 01:32:37,760
Or something from the past ride ever

1823
01:32:38,016 --> 01:32:39,808
This is so much like

1824
01:32:40,064 --> 01:32:44,160
I wanted a want to go home I want to go back screaming oil

1825
01:32:45,952 --> 01:32:47,744
It's awesome

1826
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:53,888
You are a little bit off

1827
01:33:01,568 --> 01:33:07,712
Well we can probably pull things off if there's a world government that benevolent

1828
01:33:07,968 --> 01:33:11,552
Globalization

1829
01:33:13,344 --> 01:33:13,856
Globalist

1830
01:33:14,624 --> 01:33:15,648
With scare quotes

1831
01:33:17,184 --> 01:33:19,232
He wasn't a capital G

1832
01:33:21,280 --> 01:33:22,048
He's just brilliant

1833
01:33:22,304 --> 01:33:24,608
Call the table

1834
01:33:25,120 --> 01:33:25,632
To eat

1835
01:33:25,888 --> 01:33:26,400
CMS

1836
01:33:26,656 --> 01:33:28,704
It's kind of fun also receive

1837
01:33:28,960 --> 01:33:30,240
Rodger

1838
01:33:31,520 --> 01:33:32,800
Wants to put them aside

1839
01:33:35,104 --> 01:33:35,616
Is this

1840
01:33:35,872 --> 01:33:37,152
He's trying to make more arguing

1841
01:33:37,408 --> 01:33:37,920
About vaccine

1842
01:33:38,176 --> 01:33:38,944
Being bad

1843
01:33:39,456 --> 01:33:39,968
Iron Man

1844
01:33:40,736 --> 01:33:41,504
We could have done

1845
01:33:41,760 --> 01:33:44,832
A six-hour episode just going overalls

1846
01:33:45,088 --> 01:33:45,600
The mail

1847
01:33:48,672 --> 01:33:50,464
I would much rather talk about things like that

1848
01:33:50,976 --> 01:33:52,512
That are shining examples

1849
01:33:52,768 --> 01:33:54,560
How f****** stupid Alex Jones

1850
01:33:55,072 --> 01:33:55,584
And how bad

1851
01:33:55,840 --> 01:33:56,608
You makes these arguments

1852
01:33:57,632 --> 01:34:02,496
Some side effects

1853
01:34:02,752 --> 01:34:06,080
He's talking about like doctors who are told that they should support

1854
01:34:06,592 --> 01:34:07,616
Right doctors with border

1855
01:34:13,760 --> 01:34:15,040
Washing clothes

1856
01:34:17,856 --> 01:34:20,416
Got a snake

1857
01:34:24,512 --> 01:34:30,656
Screen doors

1858
01:34:46,528 --> 01:34:47,296
Okay

1859
01:34:48,064 --> 01:34:51,904
Holyshit

1860
01:34:52,416 --> 01:34:58,048
To see the argument he's trying to make here and it may sound kind of good sort of but it's terrible

1861
01:34:58,560 --> 01:35:02,912
Screen doors made it to Mosquito couldn't fly at your house and give you malaria

1862
01:35:03,424 --> 01:35:03,936
Problem

1863
01:35:04,192 --> 01:35:08,288
The screen door wasn't invented till 1887 which is a bit after the Industrial Revolution

1864
01:35:08,544 --> 01:35:10,080
It took us a long time to

1865
01:35:10,336 --> 01:35:12,896
How to get to the screen door

1866
01:35:13,152 --> 01:35:17,760
Some window screens were created before this but the word immediately

1867
01:35:18,528 --> 01:35:19,296
Washington

1868
01:35:19,552 --> 01:35:22,880
Doesn't work out there

1869
01:35:23,136 --> 01:35:27,488
Ignorant

1870
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:34,144
The formulated from the series about hand washing in 1846 in Florence Nightingale and Oliver Wendell

1871
01:35:35,936 --> 01:35:37,472
But their ideas were not popular

1872
01:35:37,728 --> 01:35:41,312
Mostly because doctors felt like they were being blamed for contaminated

1873
01:35:41,568 --> 01:35:44,896
And at that time we believe that water itself was the source of infection

1874
01:35:45,152 --> 01:35:48,224
Along with foul odors called miasmas

1875
01:35:48,736 --> 01:35:52,576
It wasn't performed some formal experiments in the middle

1876
01:35:52,832 --> 01:35:53,344
1860s

1877
01:35:53,600 --> 01:35:56,160
Germ Theory a little bit more serious

1878
01:35:56,928 --> 01:35:59,488
The CDC didn't even exist until 1946

1879
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,816
According to retrospective published by the World Health Organization

1880
01:36:03,328 --> 01:36:09,472
In the United States actual hand hygiene guidelines published

1881
01:36:09,984 --> 01:36:12,544
Most of the public discussion about hand washing

1882
01:36:12,800 --> 01:36:14,592
Terry was Donnie

1883
01:36:15,616 --> 01:36:18,944
Not because they thought it would protect customers that because they thought it was

1884
01:36:19,456 --> 01:36:21,504
A fear-based way that they could move more product

1885
01:36:21,760 --> 01:36:23,296
Man ignaz semmelweis

1886
01:36:23,552 --> 01:36:24,064
Is one of the most

1887
01:36:24,320 --> 01:36:24,832
Was tragic

1888
01:36:25,600 --> 01:36:31,744
Figures in the medical community

1889
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:32,768
To really start

1890
01:36:33,024 --> 01:36:33,536
Applying

1891
01:36:33,792 --> 01:36:34,304
Double blind

1892
01:36:34,560 --> 01:36:35,328
Studies and

1893
01:36:35,840 --> 01:36:36,352
And actually

1894
01:36:36,864 --> 01:36:38,144
Treating scientific

1895
01:36:39,168 --> 01:36:40,448
One of the big things that

1896
01:36:40,704 --> 01:36:41,216
He did was

1897
01:36:42,496 --> 01:36:45,568
We're going directly from an autopsy

1898
01:36:45,824 --> 01:36:46,848
To a child birthing

1899
01:36:47,616 --> 01:36:49,408
All of Our Midwives are not

1900
01:36:49,664 --> 01:36:50,944
Killing these pregnant

1901
01:36:51,200 --> 01:36:53,248
And all of our doctors are killing me

1902
01:36:54,528 --> 01:36:57,344
Let's think about this and then later he died of sepsis

1903
01:36:57,856 --> 01:37:01,696
He was fighting against jiren

1904
01:37:03,232 --> 01:37:04,000
I'm so sad

1905
01:37:04,768 --> 01:37:06,816
Poor guy

1906
01:37:09,120 --> 01:37:11,168
Speaking the Industrial Revolution

1907
01:37:11,424 --> 01:37:12,960
Considered to be the. Between 70

1908
01:37:13,216 --> 01:37:14,496
60 + 18

1909
01:37:14,752 --> 01:37:16,800
It was a disease index

1910
01:37:19,616 --> 01:37:23,712
Outpace advances

1911
01:37:23,968 --> 01:37:25,504
Colorado horse common

1912
01:37:26,016 --> 01:37:28,576
Because of how easy it was for water to be contaminated

1913
01:37:28,832 --> 01:37:33,440
These newly urban areas and how people were living in far greater density than they were before

1914
01:37:33,696 --> 01:37:35,744
Communicable diseases went absolutely nuts

1915
01:37:36,256 --> 01:37:40,608
Is estimated that tuberculosis killed one-third of everyone who died in the United Kingdom

1916
01:37:40,864 --> 01:37:41,632
1800

1917
01:37:42,144 --> 01:37:42,656
Q50

1918
01:37:42,912 --> 01:37:43,424
Because the condition

1919
01:37:43,680 --> 01:37:45,728
Brought out on Bybee Bistro Revolution

1920
01:37:46,240 --> 01:37:50,848
Serious researchers and historians are pretty uniformly behind the idea that industrialization has

1921
01:37:51,104 --> 01:37:52,384
I've been a driver

1922
01:37:52,640 --> 01:37:53,664
Towards diminished health

1923
01:37:53,920 --> 01:37:54,432
Condition

1924
01:37:55,456 --> 01:37:56,480
One of the things the most

1925
01:37:56,736 --> 01:38:00,576
Devastated urbanizing Industrial Revolution

1926
01:38:01,344 --> 01:38:03,392
It was so contagious and had a history of

1927
01:38:03,648 --> 01:38:04,672
Completely destroying world

1928
01:38:05,440 --> 01:38:09,536
Spanish and Portuguese explorers introduced into the new world pretty much spell death

1929
01:38:09,792 --> 01:38:10,304
For the Aztecs

1930
01:38:10,560 --> 01:38:11,072
And the Inca

1931
01:38:11,584 --> 01:38:12,352
He's a seriously

1932
01:38:12,608 --> 01:38:13,888
F*****-up dangerous disease

1933
01:38:14,400 --> 01:38:15,680
It said that an eighteenth-century

1934
01:38:15,936 --> 01:38:19,008
Thousand people die from it every year in Europe

1935
01:38:19,264 --> 01:38:21,568
And the fatality rate for children who contacted it

1936
01:38:21,824 --> 01:38:24,640
Was reported at 98%

1937
01:38:24,896 --> 01:38:27,200
Depending on what country in Europe

1938
01:38:27,968 --> 01:38:34,112
That's a bummer. That's a bummer you couldn't get it again

1939
01:38:34,880 --> 01:38:36,416
People knew that going back to approximate

1940
01:38:36,672 --> 01:38:37,696
430 BC

1941
01:38:37,952 --> 01:38:39,488
But no one really knew how to

1942
01:38:39,744 --> 01:38:40,256
Treated

1943
01:38:40,512 --> 01:38:43,584
In the early 1600s a doctor

1944
01:38:43,840 --> 01:38:46,400
Advocated patience quotes

1945
01:38:46,656 --> 01:38:50,752
No fire in the room leave windows permanently open

1946
01:38:53,824 --> 01:38:58,432
Bottles of small beer every 12 hours

1947
01:38:58,688 --> 01:39:00,480
Pliny the Elder

1948
01:39:00,992 --> 01:39:05,088
Yeah pull up the pants

1949
01:39:06,368 --> 01:39:07,904
This didn't work

1950
01:39:08,160 --> 01:39:08,672
Don't

1951
01:39:09,440 --> 01:39:09,952
How could you

1952
01:39:10,208 --> 01:39:10,976
You trust a man

1953
01:39:11,488 --> 01:39:12,512
With snide in

1954
01:39:14,048 --> 01:39:14,560
It's just not possible

1955
01:39:14,816 --> 01:39:16,864
In 1796 a doctor name

1956
01:39:17,120 --> 01:39:21,216
Edward Jenner decided to start experimenting with seeing if you could figure out how to prevent

1957
01:39:26,592 --> 01:39:28,640
Because they come down with less of yourself

1958
01:39:28,896 --> 01:39:30,432
That they would never get smallpox

1959
01:39:30,944 --> 01:39:34,528
This interaction that he had when he was younger

1960
01:39:34,784 --> 01:39:36,320
He began experimenting with kelp

1961
01:39:37,088 --> 01:39:40,160
This would eventually lead to him inventing vaccinations

1962
01:39:40,416 --> 01:39:44,000
Which box is the Latin word for cow is vodka

1963
01:39:45,024 --> 01:39:45,536
In

1964
01:39:45,792 --> 01:39:47,072
7th

1965
01:39:47,328 --> 01:39:50,144
He published his findings which were literally

1966
01:39:50,400 --> 01:39:51,168
Cowpox

1967
01:39:51,424 --> 01:39:53,984
But the community was not fast to get on board

1968
01:39:54,496 --> 01:39:59,360
M17 conducted to determine if having survived

1969
01:39:59,616 --> 01:40:00,128
Fox

1970
01:40:00,384 --> 01:40:01,408
Developing an immunity

1971
01:40:02,688 --> 01:40:03,456
Impact

1972
01:40:04,992 --> 01:40:06,016
He proved his hypothesis

1973
01:40:06,528 --> 01:40:09,088
Affect

1974
01:40:09,344 --> 01:40:11,136
As well

1975
01:40:11,648 --> 01:40:13,952
The work was far from done for instance

1976
01:40:14,208 --> 01:40:20,352
Set the timer for

1977
01:40:20,608 --> 01:40:21,120
Responsible for

1978
01:40:21,376 --> 01:40:22,656
Stepping medical progress

1979
01:40:22,912 --> 01:40:24,448
It's hundreds of thousands of Lies

1980
01:40:25,216 --> 01:40:27,264
The last naturally occurring case of smallpox

1981
01:40:27,520 --> 01:40:28,800
Recorded

1982
01:40:29,056 --> 01:40:29,824
1877

1983
01:40:30,336 --> 01:40:33,408
And that would not have been possible without Edwin Jenner Edward Jenner

1984
01:40:33,664 --> 01:40:34,176
It is cowpox

1985
01:40:35,200 --> 01:40:38,528
Alex and talk a lot of s*** about screen doors all f****** want

1986
01:40:38,784 --> 01:40:39,808
But are you staying any

1987
01:40:40,576 --> 01:40:41,344
If you look at just

1988
01:40:41,600 --> 01:40:42,112
Case of music

1989
01:40:42,624 --> 01:40:44,416
According to a review studies published

1990
01:40:44,672 --> 01:40:45,696
In the Journal of the American Medical

1991
01:40:45,952 --> 01:40:46,464
Association

1992
01:40:46,976 --> 01:40:48,512
The measles vaccine was not life

1993
01:40:48,768 --> 01:40:49,536
United States

1994
01:40:49,792 --> 01:40:50,304
Covid-19 sick

1995
01:40:52,352 --> 01:40:53,120
Incidence of measles

1996
01:40:53,632 --> 01:40:54,400
300 cases

1997
01:40:54,656 --> 01:40:55,424
For 100,000

1998
01:40:56,192 --> 01:40:57,472
After introducing the vaccine

1999
01:41:00,800 --> 01:41:01,312
Cases

2000
01:41:01,568 --> 01:41:02,592
For 100,000

2001
01:41:03,104 --> 01:41:06,432
You see this trend very clearly as it relates to other vaccine-preventable

2002
01:41:07,200 --> 01:41:08,480
The science is very clear

2003
01:41:08,736 --> 01:41:11,808
Nobody want to talk about the idea that the vaccine rates

2004
01:41:12,064 --> 01:41:13,088
Can also go up

2005
01:41:13,344 --> 01:41:16,160
That's a part of the science because as

2006
01:41:16,416 --> 01:41:20,000
Because here in this path roof Edward Jenner in his

2007
01:41:20,256 --> 01:41:21,280
Is smallpox vaccine

2008
01:41:21,792 --> 01:41:27,936
Educreations you don't know if it's going to be a permanent immunization

2009
01:41:28,192 --> 01:41:31,520
Booster shot

2010
01:41:31,776 --> 01:41:33,312
Yeah or there are infants

2011
01:41:33,568 --> 01:41:34,080
This word

2012
01:41:34,336 --> 01:41:34,848
You know.

2013
01:41:35,104 --> 01:41:35,872
Some gift

2014
01:41:36,896 --> 01:41:41,504
That's the processes

2015
01:41:42,272 --> 01:41:43,040
So there's ways

2016
01:41:43,296 --> 01:41:44,064
You can twist statistic

2017
01:41:44,320 --> 01:41:44,832
It's all you want

2018
01:41:45,088 --> 01:41:46,112
But when you really get down

2019
01:41:46,368 --> 01:41:46,880
The bottom of it

2020
01:41:47,136 --> 01:41:47,904
Hand washing

2021
01:41:48,160 --> 01:41:48,672
Is not respond

2022
01:41:48,928 --> 01:41:49,952
Over that although it does help

2023
01:41:51,744 --> 01:41:52,768
Screen doors

2024
01:41:53,280 --> 01:41:57,888
Malaria and Dengue fever but the timelines off and

2025
01:41:58,400 --> 01:42:04,288
The Industrial Revolution is literally the worst thing you could use as an argument for

2026
01:42:04,544 --> 01:42:06,080
Zach bringing down Taziki's

2027
01:42:10,176 --> 01:42:10,688
Apples

2028
01:42:10,944 --> 01:42:15,040
Confusing that I get from 2009 hours

2029
01:42:15,296 --> 01:42:21,440
This is the kind of didn't expect to hear from him

2030
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:30,144
That would be like Trump wants to stop all of it this stuff all the stuff that I'm complaining but not like the Industrial Revolution solved

2031
01:42:32,192 --> 01:42:35,520
Vaccines are given you the xy&z they're going to turn your kid to a mute

2032
01:42:35,776 --> 01:42:36,800
Trump is going to give

2033
01:42:37,312 --> 01:42:43,456
Restorative cures that all the globalist have been hiding

2034
01:42:43,712 --> 01:42:44,224
8

2035
01:42:44,480 --> 01:42:45,504
It never

2036
01:42:45,760 --> 01:42:47,552
Fails to fascinate me that

2037
01:42:47,808 --> 01:42:48,320
How

2038
01:42:48,576 --> 01:42:49,344
How the

2039
01:42:49,856 --> 01:42:50,368
How did

2040
01:42:50,624 --> 01:42:51,136
Friend of his

2041
01:42:51,392 --> 01:42:52,416
History

2042
01:42:52,928 --> 01:42:54,208
It's constantly like

2043
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:58,304
We solve this problem you know like when you're talking about

2044
01:42:58,816 --> 01:43:00,352
The Great Depression

2045
01:43:00,608 --> 01:43:01,632
When you talk about how they in

2046
01:43:02,144 --> 01:43:02,656
The marginal tax

2047
01:43:03,424 --> 01:43:03,936
Broke down

2048
01:43:04,448 --> 01:43:05,472
So much of income

2049
01:43:05,728 --> 01:43:06,240
How many quality

2050
01:43:06,496 --> 01:43:07,008
And that

2051
01:43:07,264 --> 01:43:09,312
I led to a. Of

2052
01:43:11,872 --> 01:43:14,944
And then they forgot why the Great Depression

2053
01:43:15,712 --> 01:43:17,248
The generation that lived

2054
01:43:17,504 --> 01:43:18,016
Through it.

2055
01:43:21,600 --> 01:43:23,392
And so they went right back to all the same

2056
01:43:23,648 --> 01:43:28,000
In the same way getting rid of smallpox

2057
01:43:28,512 --> 01:43:29,792
The last recorded

2058
01:43:30,304 --> 01:43:31,584
Naturally occurring

2059
01:43:33,120 --> 01:43:34,144
The last recorded

2060
01:43:35,936 --> 01:43:36,448
Happened 50

2061
01:43:36,704 --> 01:43:37,216
2 years ago

2062
01:43:37,472 --> 01:43:38,752
Airport

2063
01:43:39,776 --> 01:43:40,544
I n

2064
01:43:42,336 --> 01:43:43,360
Forgot

2065
01:43:43,616 --> 01:43:44,896
But the only reason that

2066
01:43:45,408 --> 01:43:46,176
Hundreds of thousands

2067
01:43:46,688 --> 01:43:47,968
People aren't

2068
01:43:48,992 --> 01:43:50,016
Because of vaccine

2069
01:43:50,272 --> 01:43:53,600
So these vaccinate

2070
01:43:53,856 --> 01:43:57,440
Come up because they're like seeing we never had

2071
01:44:00,512 --> 01:44:01,024
Smallpox

2072
01:44:01,280 --> 01:44:03,584
In order to Lycra seineyard

2073
01:44:03,840 --> 01:44:05,632
Once you realize reality

2074
01:44:05,888 --> 01:44:07,936
You don't have to attack vaccines of having something

2075
01:44:08,192 --> 01:44:09,216
Enzyme that bad

2076
01:44:09,472 --> 01:44:10,496
Which is where you create

2077
01:44:10,752 --> 01:44:14,080
Clean vaccine when we go we go back to that

2078
01:44:14,336 --> 01:44:16,384
If you're prepared for a problem

2079
01:44:16,640 --> 01:44:18,688
That's because you're going to cause the problem

2080
01:44:18,944 --> 01:44:20,224
The problem happened

2081
01:44:21,248 --> 01:44:22,016
You weren't prepared

2082
01:44:22,528 --> 01:44:26,880
Always your fault

2083
01:44:27,392 --> 01:44:29,440
Interesting I enjoy all this

2084
01:44:29,952 --> 01:44:30,464
It's a lot of fun

2085
01:44:30,720 --> 01:44:32,256
But it's not nearly as fun

2086
01:44:32,768 --> 01:44:33,792
Is this next ad

2087
01:44:34,304 --> 01:44:36,608
But Alex is doing

2088
01:44:36,864 --> 01:44:40,448
I would say that there is a trend where Alex's address

2089
01:44:40,960 --> 01:44:44,032
The first one was a little passive-aggressive

2090
01:44:44,288 --> 01:44:45,312
Now they're turning into

2091
01:44:45,568 --> 01:44:46,080
Like Direct

2092
01:45:02,464 --> 01:45:06,560
Give me a people don't know how great our products are nowadays they are how much you need them

2093
01:45:06,816 --> 01:45:09,632
Apollinaire

2094
01:45:09,888 --> 01:45:13,984
Hillary Clinton

2095
01:45:14,240 --> 01:45:20,384
Running the vaccine propaganda Bureau and a secret

2096
01:45:35,488 --> 01:45:39,072
Because we got the

2097
01:45:40,352 --> 01:45:43,680
That's a threat if you don't donate to knowledge fight

2098
01:45:43,936 --> 01:45:50,080
If you don't go to our website and I will tell you what's going to happen

2099
01:45:50,336 --> 01:45:51,872
Right now

2100
01:45:52,128 --> 01:45:54,944
That tells me that you want Alex Jones

2101
01:45:55,200 --> 01:45:58,528
If you don't tell your friends about now it's right that tells me that you

2102
01:45:58,784 --> 01:46:00,320
What

2103
01:46:01,856 --> 01:46:03,136
So gross man

2104
01:46:03,904 --> 01:46:04,928
It's just it's just

2105
01:46:05,184 --> 01:46:06,464
Weird grossed

2106
01:46:06,720 --> 01:46:07,232
You know

2107
01:46:07,488 --> 01:46:09,024
It is a threat that's threatened

2108
01:46:09,536 --> 01:46:12,352
Yeah it's if you don't give me enough money to Vici

2109
01:46:12,864 --> 01:46:14,144
Whatever

2110
01:46:14,400 --> 01:46:19,264
The vague idea of whatever I think you should be giving me

2111
01:46:19,520 --> 01:46:21,056
X number is not a

2112
01:46:21,568 --> 01:46:24,384
Do you want to be raped by the devil

2113
01:46:25,664 --> 01:46:26,432
Joy

2114
01:46:26,688 --> 01:46:29,760
For the last 23 years I've been on air

2115
01:46:30,016 --> 01:46:35,904
Give me money in that means you know what maybe I shouldn't know a f*** you f*** you talk to Stevens are coming

2116
01:46:37,696 --> 01:46:43,840
Wild wild before

2117
01:46:44,096 --> 01:46:46,400
Sweat like threading

2118
01:46:46,656 --> 01:46:47,168
Threatening

2119
01:46:48,192 --> 01:46:49,216
Pivots I like it

2120
01:46:49,472 --> 01:46:52,288
If you don't we're f****** Diamond gusset

2121
01:46:53,056 --> 01:46:55,360
Do you know what you want you want your balls to be

2122
01:46:56,384 --> 01:46:56,896
Skeetos

2123
01:46:57,152 --> 01:47:01,760
Cuz that's what happens when you wear other f******

2124
01:47:06,624 --> 01:47:09,696
The end of the 28th that's the end of Monday

2125
01:47:11,744 --> 01:47:13,024
And I think it's really I think

2126
01:47:14,816 --> 01:47:16,096
Unisuper interesting way

2127
01:47:16,352 --> 01:47:17,632
It's a lot

2128
01:47:17,888 --> 01:47:19,424
There's a lot of content

2129
01:47:19,936 --> 01:47:20,960
Real pain in my ass

2130
01:47:21,472 --> 01:47:21,984
Preparing

2131
01:47:22,752 --> 01:47:23,520
Stretching out over this

2132
01:47:24,800 --> 01:47:25,568
It's worth it because

2133
01:47:25,824 --> 01:47:26,848
The Narrative plays out

2134
01:47:27,360 --> 01:47:29,152
On Sunday you see the colonel

2135
01:47:29,408 --> 01:47:31,456
Beginning of Alex setup

2136
01:47:32,736 --> 01:47:33,760
Yearning for something

2137
01:47:34,784 --> 01:47:35,552
On Monday

2138
01:47:36,064 --> 01:47:37,600
Start to talk about

2139
01:47:37,856 --> 01:47:39,392
I'm f****** Rodger Stone to Donald Trump

2140
01:47:39,648 --> 01:47:40,672
I'm doing almost

2141
01:47:40,928 --> 01:47:42,720
Entire show where he just goes

2142
01:47:42,976 --> 01:47:44,000
F****** vaccine

2143
01:47:47,072 --> 01:47:49,120
Like really not much Trump defense

2144
01:47:50,912 --> 01:47:51,936
On Tuesday

2145
01:47:52,192 --> 01:47:52,960
On the 29th

2146
01:47:55,776 --> 01:47:56,288
With Rodger Stone

2147
01:47:56,544 --> 01:47:57,312
At the beginning of the shop

2148
01:47:57,568 --> 01:47:58,336
Because Rodger

2149
01:47:58,592 --> 01:47:59,360
Just gone

2150
01:47:59,616 --> 01:48:03,456
I am plead not guilty

2151
01:48:03,712 --> 01:48:04,480
Got booed

2152
01:48:04,736 --> 01:48:06,528
Alex is not happy about that either

2153
01:48:06,784 --> 01:48:12,928
That's really starting to piss Alex off cuz the Optics of it are very difficult to Rodger keeps

2154
01:48:13,184 --> 01:48:13,952
Getting booed everywhere

2155
01:48:14,208 --> 01:48:17,024
Eventually people are not going to like they're not going to go like

2156
01:48:17,280 --> 01:48:18,816
Oh yeah there is a globalist

2157
01:48:19,072 --> 01:48:21,888
The people fake news media

2158
01:48:22,400 --> 01:48:23,168
Haha

2159
01:48:28,288 --> 01:48:30,336
Everybody wrong

2160
01:48:30,848 --> 01:48:32,640
Huh

2161
01:48:32,896 --> 01:48:34,432
Interview and it's exactly the same

2162
01:48:34,944 --> 01:48:35,968
We saw on our Monday

2163
01:48:36,736 --> 01:48:38,016
Where Alex is most

2164
01:48:38,272 --> 01:48:41,088
Preoccupied with the idea of this being a world exclusive

2165
01:48:43,648 --> 01:48:44,672
Is really driving him

2166
01:48:45,696 --> 01:48:46,720
Trying to talk to Rodger

2167
01:48:47,232 --> 01:48:48,768
Tomorrow's news

2168
01:48:50,048 --> 01:48:52,096
Rodger Stone

2169
01:48:54,400 --> 01:48:59,520
Giving Ashley World exclusive after his arraignment there were hundreds of cameras and reporters out front

2170
01:48:59,776 --> 01:49:01,568
Just 30 minutes ago when he came out

2171
01:49:03,104 --> 01:49:09,248
From the Giants running reporters

2172
01:49:10,272 --> 01:49:15,904
You're going to prison

2173
01:49:16,160 --> 01:49:17,184
To defend himself

2174
01:49:18,464 --> 01:49:21,536
Rodger

2175
01:49:34,336 --> 01:49:38,944
World

2176
01:49:39,200 --> 01:49:40,480
Exclusive

2177
01:49:41,248 --> 01:49:42,272
It's hard to

2178
01:49:42,528 --> 01:49:44,064
Square that with the fact

2179
01:49:44,320 --> 01:49:47,392
Roger's been on every f****** show that'll have him on

2180
01:49:48,160 --> 01:49:51,232
It's even harder to square that without peer in the show

2181
01:49:51,488 --> 01:49:53,536
Rodger said the earlier that morning

2182
01:49:53,792 --> 01:49:56,608
On Tuesday he been on Mancow show

2183
01:49:56,864 --> 01:49:58,144
Amen cow says hello

2184
01:49:58,656 --> 01:50:04,800
So the idea that he'd been on world exclusive you've been on Mancow show earlier been on Fox news all over the place

2185
01:50:05,056 --> 01:50:08,128
Promotes that he's going to be on Laura Ingraham while he's on Alex's show

2186
01:50:08,384 --> 01:50:11,712
This if there's no exclusivity today I think it's real

2187
01:50:11,968 --> 01:50:13,760
I think he's really getting frustrated

2188
01:50:14,016 --> 01:50:16,320
Rodger does not have other

2189
01:50:16,576 --> 01:50:17,856
I have a new thing can go down

2190
01:50:18,112 --> 01:50:22,464
When Alex got sued by the Sandy Hook families he couldn't go on Tucker Carlson

2191
01:50:22,720 --> 01:50:24,000
Go on Hannity

2192
01:50:24,256 --> 01:50:30,400
They wouldn't have him onto the hottest item in town he's welcome on all

2193
01:50:30,656 --> 01:50:31,936
All the Fox News shows

2194
01:50:34,496 --> 01:50:36,288
Go to Mancow Muller's place

2195
01:50:37,312 --> 01:50:39,616
Finger related

2196
01:50:40,896 --> 01:50:43,200
So Alex is starting to get this bike

2197
01:50:43,968 --> 01:50:44,480
Fuimadane him

2198
01:50:44,992 --> 01:50:45,760
Bubbling of like

2199
01:50:47,040 --> 01:50:47,552
Motherfuker

2200
01:50:47,808 --> 01:50:48,832
I keep trying to say that it's a

2201
01:50:49,088 --> 01:50:49,600
Exclusive

2202
01:50:50,112 --> 01:50:52,160
He knows that he needs more than I can provide him

2203
01:50:52,672 --> 01:50:53,952
He's going he's working

2204
01:50:54,208 --> 01:50:54,720
Across perfect

2205
01:50:55,232 --> 01:50:56,256
Is a wrestling business

2206
01:50:57,280 --> 01:50:58,304
Business for yourself

2207
01:50:58,560 --> 01:51:00,352
Roger's going into business for himself

2208
01:51:00,864 --> 01:51:03,936
In the middle of the match right here but we're witnessing is a match

2209
01:51:04,704 --> 01:51:05,728
Is there a tag team

2210
01:51:05,984 --> 01:51:08,032
Rogers basically

2211
01:51:08,800 --> 01:51:12,384
Twisting the script what they're supposed to be doing

2212
01:51:12,640 --> 01:51:13,920
And Alex's just like holding the bag

2213
01:51:14,432 --> 01:51:15,712
It's very

2214
01:51:15,968 --> 01:51:16,480
Very clear

2215
01:51:17,504 --> 01:51:18,272
I love it

2216
01:51:20,320 --> 01:51:21,088
Unfortunate

2217
01:51:21,344 --> 01:51:22,112
That Alex

2218
01:51:22,368 --> 01:51:22,880
Hasn't

2219
01:51:23,136 --> 01:51:23,648
Fired

2220
01:51:24,928 --> 01:51:26,464
Because that seems like his

2221
01:51:29,536 --> 01:51:32,608
I'm not saying he does but Alex does say something

2222
01:51:32,864 --> 01:51:34,144
That implies that

2223
01:51:34,400 --> 01:51:35,168
Done

2224
01:51:39,264 --> 01:51:39,776
Pieces

2225
01:51:40,800 --> 01:51:41,312
From the past

2226
01:51:42,848 --> 01:51:43,872
As if enough lumber

2227
01:51:44,128 --> 01:51:46,176
Is it out of the Twilight

2228
01:51:46,432 --> 01:51:46,944
His eyes are

2229
01:51:47,968 --> 01:51:48,480
Come back again

2230
01:51:48,736 --> 01:51:50,272
The sleeping giant has awoken

2231
01:51:50,528 --> 01:51:52,320
He starts to talk about these sources that

2232
01:51:53,088 --> 01:51:54,624
Talk about all the time

2233
01:51:54,880 --> 01:51:55,392
Free Trump

2234
01:51:55,648 --> 01:51:59,232
Paris sources we haven't heard about in a long time

2235
01:52:00,256 --> 01:52:01,280
Why was growing up

2236
01:52:02,304 --> 01:52:03,072
And I wish

2237
01:52:03,328 --> 01:52:06,400
The military is officers people would have been

2238
01:52:06,656 --> 01:52:08,192
FBI always other places

2239
01:52:09,472 --> 01:52:13,056
Not a pencil pushing paper pushing areas but no real on-the-ground stub

2240
01:52:13,568 --> 01:52:14,592
I always heard

2241
01:52:15,360 --> 01:52:17,152
I always thought it was weird not true

2242
01:52:24,320 --> 01:52:26,880
Was obsessed with

2243
01:52:27,904 --> 01:52:30,464
Government worldwide

2244
01:52:41,984 --> 01:52:44,032
Kevin Hart program

2245
01:52:44,288 --> 01:52:45,568
Super secret space

2246
01:52:47,616 --> 01:52:49,920
More influential

2247
01:52:54,784 --> 01:52:57,856
Got a Black Ops everybody else today confirmed as well

2248
01:53:02,208 --> 01:53:08,352
He's bringing up these old used to be such a part of things we'd encounter General

2249
01:53:08,608 --> 01:53:12,960
2015

2250
01:53:13,216 --> 01:53:19,360
Where the two of them tried to sell $30 laminated

2251
01:53:19,616 --> 01:53:21,152
They were laminate

2252
01:53:21,408 --> 01:53:24,480
A bunch of b******* white genocide narratives

2253
01:53:25,760 --> 01:53:26,528
Real ghosts real

2254
01:53:28,832 --> 01:53:32,160
Career in the military services

2255
01:53:33,952 --> 01:53:34,720
From 1950

2256
01:53:34,976 --> 01:53:36,256
T22 1984

2257
01:53:36,768 --> 01:53:39,840
You may be asking yourself why you left the military in 1984

2258
01:53:40,096 --> 01:53:43,424
Seems like if you're in for 32 years you wouldn't leave unless you have to

2259
01:53:43,680 --> 01:53:44,192
Turns out

2260
01:53:44,704 --> 01:53:45,216
He had to

2261
01:53:46,496 --> 01:53:51,104
General mobile

2262
01:53:53,664 --> 01:53:57,760
1st Battalion operations manual

2263
01:53:58,016 --> 01:54:00,064
A book written by a guy named

2264
01:54:00,320 --> 01:54:01,344
It was packed to the gills

2265
01:54:01,600 --> 01:54:03,648
Project

2266
01:54:05,184 --> 01:54:09,280
For creating a class of warrior monks in our special abilities

2267
01:54:09,536 --> 01:54:11,328
Which one

2268
01:54:11,584 --> 01:54:17,728
USSR creating project investigates

2269
01:54:17,984 --> 01:54:18,752
Psychic Warfare

2270
01:54:19,008 --> 01:54:25,152
It ran between 1981 and 1984 he's the man who

2271
01:54:25,408 --> 01:54:26,688
Visible and walk through walls

2272
01:54:26,944 --> 01:54:28,992
As well as remote View and some world

2273
01:54:29,504 --> 01:54:34,112
None of these efforts were successful

2274
01:54:34,368 --> 01:54:40,256
Yep I didn't realize that that was Albert stubblebine

2275
01:54:40,768 --> 01:54:42,560
That was the guy didn't know that

2276
01:54:43,328 --> 01:54:49,472
That is because I've read that f****** book not the main character in the book or anything like that he is the guy who tries to walk

2277
01:54:49,728 --> 01:54:50,496
Walk through walls

2278
01:54:50,752 --> 01:54:54,336
So

2279
01:54:54,848 --> 01:54:55,872
He's really he's really good

2280
01:54:56,128 --> 01:55:00,224
406s for 3-years of creating super soldier

2281
01:55:00,480 --> 01:55:02,528
The military for that

2282
01:55:03,040 --> 01:55:08,160
It turns out that in order to super soldiers General stubblebine

2283
01:55:08,416 --> 01:55:09,952
Sensitive compartmentalised

2284
01:55:10,208 --> 01:55:10,976
Information facility

2285
01:55:11,488 --> 01:55:15,328
Which is crazy violation of security protocol

2286
01:55:15,584 --> 01:55:16,352
It was kicked out for that

2287
01:55:16,864 --> 01:55:19,936
There's no

2288
01:55:20,192 --> 01:55:20,960
After all of that

2289
01:55:21,216 --> 01:55:21,728
Considering Alex

2290
01:55:24,032 --> 01:55:25,312
Stop

2291
01:55:26,592 --> 01:55:27,872
That's repentant a park

2292
01:55:28,128 --> 01:55:32,480
Alex only knows him because I do with a big Oklahoma City

2293
01:55:33,248 --> 01:55:38,112
Part of a long career in the Air Force there from 31 years before retiring in 1978

2294
01:55:38,368 --> 01:55:41,184
Unfortunately that makes it pretty much impossible for him to

2295
01:55:41,440 --> 01:55:44,768
Involved in that project didn't start till 1993

2296
01:55:47,584 --> 01:55:49,888
Special Assistant to the head of the Federal Aviation

2297
01:55:50,144 --> 01:55:50,912
Association

2298
01:55:51,168 --> 01:55:53,984
But his role was mostly about the implementation of the new Jeep

2299
01:55:54,240 --> 01:55:55,008
GPS system

2300
01:55:55,264 --> 01:55:56,800
In matters of FAA policy

2301
01:55:57,056 --> 01:55:57,824
Not with creating

2302
01:55:58,336 --> 01:55:59,104
A gigantic

2303
01:56:00,128 --> 01:56:03,456
Alex knows that now bente Parton is dead so is

2304
01:56:06,016 --> 01:56:07,808
Kind of a shame because outside of

2305
01:56:08,064 --> 01:56:08,576
Some of the

2306
01:56:09,088 --> 01:56:09,600
More

2307
01:56:09,856 --> 01:56:12,672
Colorful pieces of their resumes

2308
01:56:12,928 --> 01:56:14,464
Careers that don't need exaggeration

2309
01:56:14,720 --> 01:56:15,744
You don't need to

2310
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:19,584
Claimed stubblebine was the head of Black Ops

2311
01:56:19,840 --> 01:56:21,632
Some f****** military for 32 years

2312
01:56:21,888 --> 01:56:25,216
Being apart of

2313
01:56:25,472 --> 01:56:30,336
You could just talk about his illustrious 31-year career in the Air Force

2314
01:56:30,592 --> 01:56:31,360
Is Jordan from Chicago

2315
01:56:31,616 --> 01:56:35,200
I just want to check in

2316
01:56:35,456 --> 01:56:38,016
I will let you go

2317
01:56:40,064 --> 01:56:41,344
Like these are things that existed

2318
01:56:41,856 --> 01:56:42,624
CVS app

2319
01:56:42,880 --> 01:56:44,416
They're starting to make

2320
01:56:45,184 --> 01:56:46,976
Another one another little

2321
01:56:47,232 --> 01:56:48,256
Piece of narrative

2322
01:56:48,512 --> 01:56:49,536
From the earlier day

2323
01:57:00,032 --> 01:57:02,592
Weather weapons that other people have other weapons

2324
01:57:05,152 --> 01:57:08,480
I'm the bad guy cuz I told you first about

2325
01:57:09,248 --> 01:57:10,784
Neurologist on about

2326
01:57:13,600 --> 01:57:14,112
Is it crowded

2327
01:57:19,488 --> 01:57:21,536
I like earthquake

2328
01:57:27,424 --> 01:57:30,752
Is reporting that William Cullen. Michael Cohen

2329
01:57:31,264 --> 01:57:36,384
Legitimate under Bill press conference where he admitted that they had earthquake weather

2330
01:57:37,152 --> 01:57:38,176
If he's out there admitting

2331
01:57:39,712 --> 01:57:43,040
What kind of terrifying s*** do they have that they don't talk about it

2332
01:57:45,600 --> 01:57:46,368
Be very afraid

2333
01:57:48,416 --> 01:57:48,928
Sentence right

2334
01:57:49,440 --> 01:57:55,328
So in reality without speech that secretary Cohen gave on April 28th 1997

2335
01:57:55,584 --> 01:57:58,912
We're just part of a conference on terrorism weapons of mass destruction in US strata

2336
01:57:59,936 --> 01:58:01,216
In all fairness to Alex

2337
01:58:04,032 --> 01:58:05,312
In all fairness

2338
01:58:05,568 --> 01:58:07,616
Going bring some up as an example of something that doesn't

2339
01:58:10,944 --> 01:58:14,016
The full context

2340
01:58:14,272 --> 01:58:20,416
Let me ask you specifically about last week's care here in Washington and deal with that

2341
01:58:22,464 --> 01:58:25,280
Referring to a package that arrived at the Jewish service organization

2342
01:58:26,816 --> 01:58:27,584
To be a chemical weapon

2343
01:58:28,352 --> 01:58:29,632
Cohen's response was

2344
01:58:29,888 --> 01:58:32,192
Quote the nature of the threat

2345
01:58:32,704 --> 01:58:34,496
It turned out to be a false threat under the

2346
01:58:35,264 --> 01:58:36,800
But as we've learned in the intelligence

2347
01:58:37,056 --> 01:58:38,336
Community we had something called

2348
01:58:39,872 --> 01:58:42,688
Question about Santa

2349
01:58:43,200 --> 01:58:44,480
Samir sfeir here's that

2350
01:58:45,504 --> 01:58:46,016
Say the words

2351
01:58:47,552 --> 01:58:50,624
Star Wars fandom mobile

2352
01:58:51,904 --> 01:58:54,720
Alright the mirror fear that there's a mole within an agency

2353
01:58:55,232 --> 01:58:56,512
Can set off a chain reaction

2354
01:58:56,768 --> 01:59:00,608
Hot for that particular mole which can paralyze the agency for weeks in months

2355
01:59:01,632 --> 01:59:02,144
In a search

2356
01:59:02,656 --> 01:59:04,448
The same thing is true about the false cares of

2357
01:59:04,704 --> 01:59:08,032
Threat of someone using some kind of chemical weapon or biological

2358
01:59:08,544 --> 01:59:10,848
There are some reports for example that some countries

2359
01:59:11,104 --> 01:59:13,152
I've been trying to construct something like an Ebola virus

2360
01:59:13,664 --> 01:59:15,712
Very dangerous phenomenon

2361
01:59:16,224 --> 01:59:18,016
Alvin Toffler

2362
01:59:19,552 --> 01:59:20,320
Laboratory strange

2363
01:59:22,368 --> 01:59:22,880
That would be

2364
01:59:23,136 --> 01:59:23,904
Make specific so they can

2365
01:59:24,160 --> 01:59:25,952
Just eliminate certain ethnic groups and races

2366
01:59:26,464 --> 01:59:28,768
Others are designing some sort of engineering

2367
01:59:29,024 --> 01:59:30,304
Awesome kind of inspect

2368
01:59:30,560 --> 01:59:31,840
They could destroy specific crop

2369
01:59:32,352 --> 01:59:33,120
Others are engaging

2370
01:59:33,376 --> 01:59:37,216
Eco type of terrorism whereby they can alter the climate

2371
01:59:37,472 --> 01:59:37,984
Volcanoes

2372
01:59:38,240 --> 01:59:40,032
Remotely through the use of electromagnetic

2373
01:59:40,288 --> 01:59:40,800
Somatic waves

2374
01:59:42,080 --> 01:59:43,360
He's talking about potential weapon

2375
01:59:43,872 --> 01:59:46,176
But the context of these potential weapons or is examples

2376
01:59:46,432 --> 01:59:47,712
The False Prince that they've received

2377
01:59:47,968 --> 01:59:48,480
Reports about

2378
01:59:48,736 --> 01:59:50,016
It's the sort of thing that you can't

2379
01:59:50,272 --> 01:59:54,880
Not take seriously if you're the intelligent you get some sort of report about this or thing

2380
01:59:55,136 --> 01:59:56,160
But it's not real

2381
01:59:56,672 --> 01:59:57,440
Write Alex's

2382
01:59:57,696 --> 01:59:58,208
Profoundly f***

2383
01:59:58,976 --> 02:00:01,024
Well there's so many times where you saw it during the

2384
02:00:01,280 --> 02:00:03,328
Cold War Russia be like we have laser

2385
02:00:03,840 --> 02:00:04,352
Isn't that America

2386
02:00:05,120 --> 02:00:09,472
We will be like what we have

2387
02:00:09,728 --> 02:00:10,496
He likes

2388
02:00:10,752 --> 02:00:14,336
We have anti-anti

2389
02:00:14,592 --> 02:00:17,920
There's a lot of posturing political

2390
02:00:19,712 --> 02:00:22,016
Force you to account for something that is

2391
02:00:22,272 --> 02:00:23,296
Literally unaccounted

2392
02:00:23,552 --> 02:00:24,832
You can really hurt

2393
02:00:25,088 --> 02:00:26,880
Your enemy by pretending you have a weapon

2394
02:00:27,136 --> 02:00:28,928
And it forces them to spend billions of dollars

2395
02:00:29,184 --> 02:00:30,464
Trying to find a way to protect

2396
02:00:30,720 --> 02:00:31,744
Themselves

2397
02:00:32,000 --> 02:00:34,304
Part of

2398
02:00:37,632 --> 02:00:43,008
This information is necessary for both

2399
02:00:43,264 --> 02:00:45,056
What what the most famous

2400
02:00:45,568 --> 02:00:47,616
Story I can pick up off the top of my head is

2401
02:00:49,408 --> 02:00:51,968
The British spread that idea of keratin

2402
02:00:52,480 --> 02:00:57,600
In order to distract from the fact that they were using radar

2403
02:00:57,856 --> 02:00:59,904
You know like it was that kind of like

2404
02:01:00,160 --> 02:01:06,304
Oh it's this whatever technology you have

2405
02:01:07,328 --> 02:01:07,840
Yeah

2406
02:01:08,096 --> 02:01:10,912
Do you always want to have a

2407
02:01:11,168 --> 02:01:11,680
A perceived

2408
02:01:11,936 --> 02:01:14,752
Greater threat or a perceived lesser capability

2409
02:01:15,264 --> 02:01:16,288
In order to get people off you

2410
02:01:16,544 --> 02:01:17,056
Your Trail

2411
02:01:19,872 --> 02:01:20,640
It's very clear

2412
02:01:20,896 --> 02:01:21,408
From a contact

2413
02:01:21,664 --> 02:01:22,176
He's talking about

2414
02:01:22,944 --> 02:01:23,712
That we don't have

2415
02:01:24,224 --> 02:01:25,504
There's there's like reports

2416
02:01:25,760 --> 02:01:30,368
That are false that people do have

2417
02:01:30,624 --> 02:01:31,136
Like example of

2418
02:01:37,792 --> 02:01:38,560
In this next clip

2419
02:01:38,816 --> 02:01:40,096
Alex is

2420
02:01:40,352 --> 02:01:40,864
Just getting into

2421
02:01:41,632 --> 02:01:42,144
Suggest

2422
02:01:43,424 --> 02:01:44,192
Where he's at

2423
02:01:44,448 --> 02:01:44,960
And where he's at

2424
02:01:47,264 --> 02:01:50,080
I think internally he recognizes that he's sold out

2425
02:01:50,592 --> 02:01:52,384
He's really mad about it

2426
02:01:52,640 --> 02:01:54,944
Yeah

2427
02:01:55,712 --> 02:01:57,248
There's this weird giving there's a

2428
02:01:57,504 --> 02:02:00,064
Is pushing pole is going on inside his soul

2429
02:02:00,576 --> 02:02:03,136
I need to make up for having sold out

2430
02:02:03,392 --> 02:02:06,464
Right by going back to my roots in some ways

2431
02:02:06,720 --> 02:02:07,744
But at the same time

2432
02:02:08,256 --> 02:02:12,096
If I recognize but I sold out I can never go back

2433
02:02:12,352 --> 02:02:15,168
Which is again something that we talked about

2434
02:02:15,936 --> 02:02:22,080
So long ago

2435
02:02:25,920 --> 02:02:29,504
He can do this but he can't do it like me

2436
02:02:30,784 --> 02:02:32,832
Alex

2437
02:02:33,088 --> 02:02:34,368
And one of them is selling out

2438
02:02:35,136 --> 02:02:35,648
You would never

2439
02:02:36,160 --> 02:02:37,440
I will not show up

2440
02:02:39,488 --> 02:02:42,816
I will not sell out and molest children and partly Club I will not do it

2441
02:02:48,704 --> 02:02:50,752
K

2442
02:02:52,288 --> 02:02:52,800
Listen

2443
02:02:54,080 --> 02:02:56,640
Our best products

2444
02:02:58,432 --> 02:02:59,200
What the f***

2445
02:02:59,456 --> 02:03:01,504
Yep I will never sell out

2446
02:03:01,760 --> 02:03:03,040
I will tell.

2447
02:03:03,296 --> 02:03:07,904
Do need you to give me money for these products that are b******* that I sold out

2448
02:03:08,160 --> 02:03:09,184
I also really like this

2449
02:03:09,440 --> 02:03:10,464
Flat delivery of

2450
02:03:10,720 --> 02:03:12,256
I will not tell on that

2451
02:03:12,768 --> 02:03:13,280
Haddad

2452
02:03:13,536 --> 02:03:14,304
I will never sell out

2453
02:03:15,072 --> 02:03:15,584
Emotionless

2454
02:03:20,192 --> 02:03:21,472
Alex's

2455
02:03:21,984 --> 02:03:23,008
Going back to his roots

2456
02:03:23,264 --> 02:03:25,312
I think there's been some indications of it

2457
02:03:25,568 --> 02:03:27,360
I also been making case videos

2458
02:03:28,384 --> 02:03:30,432
Really doing the first step of

2459
02:03:30,688 --> 02:03:32,480
Getting the f*** away from Rodger

2460
02:03:32,736 --> 02:03:35,296
Yeah

2461
02:03:35,552 --> 02:03:36,576
Case necessarily

2462
02:03:37,344 --> 02:03:38,368
But I will in this next one

2463
02:03:38,624 --> 02:03:44,768
Start

2464
02:03:45,024 --> 02:03:49,120
Competition

2465
02:03:52,960 --> 02:03:55,520
When

2466
02:03:58,592 --> 02:04:02,176
Mister sinister

2467
02:04:02,432 --> 02:04:04,224
Because the 24/7 Rodger Stone

2468
02:04:12,928 --> 02:04:15,488
Because of that

2469
02:04:15,744 --> 02:04:17,536
Infowars

2470
02:04:19,840 --> 02:04:22,144
At least 10 times Rodger Stones yet

2471
02:04:24,192 --> 02:04:27,008
Right now

2472
02:04:27,264 --> 02:04:30,080
That's it.

2473
02:04:30,336 --> 02:04:31,616
Have 100 bush

2474
02:04:36,224 --> 02:04:37,760
Cost money

2475
02:04:55,168 --> 02:04:55,936
You don't think it's fine

2476
02:04:56,192 --> 02:04:58,240
But that I also

2477
02:04:58,752 --> 02:04:59,520
I think there's a truth

2478
02:04:59,776 --> 02:05:00,544
In terms of Rodger

2479
02:05:01,312 --> 02:05:07,456
In terms of Paul I don't think that's true I think that's advertising for him

2480
02:05:08,224 --> 02:05:09,504
I'm going to have to lay off right

2481
02:05:10,016 --> 02:05:16,160
I'm going to have to lay off Rodger Stone never going to lay off

2482
02:05:18,208 --> 02:05:22,560
TV

2483
02:05:23,072 --> 02:05:27,680
Did Paul Joseph Watson leave is the day everything falls apart

2484
02:05:29,984 --> 02:05:31,264
And Buckley would never let him

2485
02:05:31,520 --> 02:05:32,288
Fireball

2486
02:05:32,544 --> 02:05:33,312
No matter what

2487
02:05:33,824 --> 02:05:36,640
So I don't believe that

2488
02:05:36,896 --> 02:05:37,664
Expressing something

2489
02:05:39,712 --> 02:05:42,272
Unless you motherfukers give me a bunch of money

2490
02:05:42,784 --> 02:05:48,160
I'm going to I'm going to have to lay people off that's just the reality we are going to be able to

2491
02:05:51,232 --> 02:05:57,376
Radio show now we're not instrumental

2492
02:05:57,632 --> 02:06:01,216
Chickens coming home to roost

2493
02:06:01,472 --> 02:06:04,032
So like it dirty is that I believe that

2494
02:06:05,824 --> 02:06:06,592
But I also believe it

2495
02:06:07,360 --> 02:06:07,872
Is it Alex's

2496
02:06:08,128 --> 02:06:08,896
Is really pissed off

2497
02:06:09,152 --> 02:06:11,456
It's some of the donations that could be going

2498
02:06:11,712 --> 02:06:17,856
Are going to Rodger 24-hour Rodger Stone defense is

2499
02:06:19,136 --> 02:06:20,160
I got a business to run

2500
02:06:22,976 --> 02:06:28,608
What the f***

2501
02:06:28,864 --> 02:06:30,144
Painting Rodger Stone

2502
02:06:30,656 --> 02:06:31,424
And advertise

2503
02:06:32,960 --> 02:06:33,472
Legal defense fund

2504
02:06:33,984 --> 02:06:34,496
And now he is

2505
02:06:38,336 --> 02:06:41,664
It's probably the first time in the last three years the Rodger Stone

2506
02:06:49,600 --> 02:06:50,880
These single most

2507
02:06:53,184 --> 02:06:54,720
What's the reason

2508
02:06:57,024 --> 02:06:58,048
So Alex Express

2509
02:06:58,304 --> 02:07:00,864
Rates as The Show Goes On

2510
02:07:01,632 --> 02:07:04,448
Associated with Donald Trump

2511
02:07:09,824 --> 02:07:10,336
Is that

2512
02:07:13,664 --> 02:07:18,272
About screen time

2513
02:07:18,528 --> 02:07:21,088
Government

2514
02:07:21,344 --> 02:07:27,488
Why does my right about everything

2515
02:07:27,744 --> 02:07:28,768
Everything I've done for the last

2516
02:07:29,024 --> 02:07:35,168
Tastes like you do everything possible to submit yourself as the guy who's associated with

2517
02:07:35,424 --> 02:07:41,568
Rodger Stone and Donald Trump

2518
02:07:41,824 --> 02:07:45,664
What I do before in this thing

2519
02:07:45,920 --> 02:07:46,432
Remember When

2520
02:07:48,736 --> 02:07:50,016
This is so much guys

2521
02:07:51,040 --> 02:07:51,808
Remember when I used to

2522
02:07:52,064 --> 02:07:52,576
Be great

2523
02:07:52,832 --> 02:07:58,464
Definitely

2524
02:07:58,720 --> 02:08:01,536
Talking about Rodger

2525
02:08:03,584 --> 02:08:04,352
Like just listen

2526
02:08:04,608 --> 02:08:05,120
Into his f******

2527
02:08:05,376 --> 02:08:06,656
This is like

2528
02:08:06,912 --> 02:08:08,704
This is so frustrated

2529
02:08:08,960 --> 02:08:09,472
Andover

2530
02:08:09,728 --> 02:08:10,496
He's just over it

2531
02:08:14,336 --> 02:08:15,872
Beach ball

2532
02:08:16,640 --> 02:08:18,944
Now we're going to time

2533
02:08:25,856 --> 02:08:32,000
Will become

2534
02:08:32,256 --> 02:08:33,024
People

2535
02:08:35,840 --> 02:08:39,936
About the New World Order

2536
02:08:41,472 --> 02:08:46,080
I don't think it is anyways Alex was still committed to this whole thing

2537
02:08:46,592 --> 02:08:48,384
What happened my f****** time is going to be happy

2538
02:08:48,640 --> 02:08:50,688
Regretted stupid b*******

2539
02:08:51,200 --> 02:08:52,992
Wikipedia put-upon 24-hours

2540
02:08:53,504 --> 02:08:54,016
This isn't

2541
02:08:54,272 --> 02:08:55,552
Cutting it anymore

2542
02:08:56,064 --> 02:08:56,576
I'm done

2543
02:08:56,832 --> 02:08:57,600
This isn't this

2544
02:08:57,856 --> 02:08:58,624
Strong

2545
02:08:59,904 --> 02:09:00,416
Rogers

2546
02:09:00,672 --> 02:09:01,440
John

2547
02:09:05,280 --> 02:09:07,072
Of your illegal

2548
02:09:07,328 --> 02:09:09,120
An indictment of your character for me

2549
02:09:09,376 --> 02:09:11,936
And I

2550
02:09:12,192 --> 02:09:13,984
About this

2551
02:09:14,496 --> 02:09:18,080
And I don't think it does anything really positive about me but I put in my time without

2552
02:09:18,336 --> 02:09:20,896
Restaurants unique ability to understand

2553
02:09:21,408 --> 02:09:26,272
Everything I hear being put forth from him in the aftermath of Rodger Stone indicted

2554
02:09:27,040 --> 02:09:29,088
Just often empty nope sleep on it

2555
02:09:29,344 --> 02:09:32,928
Here is Alex screaming I want to go back

2556
02:09:33,696 --> 02:09:34,720
Roger's going to prison

2557
02:09:34,976 --> 02:09:39,584
Jerome corsi is mixed up in all of it

2558
02:09:39,840 --> 02:09:44,192
Webster Tarpley cuz I saw Trump for the danger that he was

2559
02:09:44,704 --> 02:09:48,800
Jakari Jackson he lost Rob Jacobson had to fire Joe Biggs over pizzagate

2560
02:09:49,056 --> 02:09:54,688
BMX dude doesn't seem to enter this anymore Rodger Stone was the glue holding together a fractured world

2561
02:09:54,944 --> 02:09:55,712
Without him

2562
02:09:55,968 --> 02:09:56,736
It's not going to work

2563
02:09:56,992 --> 02:09:57,504
Misdirection

2564
02:09:57,760 --> 02:09:58,272
Anymore

2565
02:10:01,344 --> 02:10:01,856
Trying to

2566
02:10:02,368 --> 02:10:03,648
To the idyllic pastors

2567
02:10:03,904 --> 02:10:04,416
Of his past

2568
02:10:04,672 --> 02:10:05,696
Not realizing

2569
02:10:06,208 --> 02:10:06,976
You can't go home again

2570
02:10:08,000 --> 02:10:10,816
Is George Weber learn to Tom Wolfe's book of that title

2571
02:10:11,072 --> 02:10:15,680
You can't go back home to your family back to your childhood back home to a young man's dream

2572
02:10:15,936 --> 02:10:16,704
Gloria

2573
02:10:17,216 --> 02:10:19,264
Back home to the places in the country

2574
02:10:19,520 --> 02:10:21,312
Back home to the old forms and systems

2575
02:10:21,568 --> 02:10:23,104
The things which once seemed Everlast

2576
02:10:23,616 --> 02:10:24,896
But we are changing all the time

2577
02:10:25,408 --> 02:10:27,200
Back home to the escapes of time and memory

2578
02:10:27,968 --> 02:10:32,320
3 years of becoming what he is now with taking a toll on Alex that he'll never be able to

2579
02:10:32,576 --> 02:10:33,088
Undo

2580
02:10:33,344 --> 02:10:37,696
Every day he woke up and came into his Studio to tie his name is reputation to Trump

2581
02:10:37,952 --> 02:10:38,720
Intentionally

2582
02:10:39,232 --> 02:10:40,768
And that is not something that goes away just

2583
02:10:41,024 --> 02:10:43,584
Because your friend got arrested and you don't want to play that game at

2584
02:10:44,608 --> 02:10:45,632
Alex is every reason

2585
02:10:45,888 --> 02:10:47,936
Don't want to go back to His Marvelous sunset

2586
02:10:48,448 --> 02:10:49,216
His better days

2587
02:10:49,472 --> 02:10:49,984
But he can't

2588
02:10:50,496 --> 02:10:52,288
Because he's been changed by the journey

2589
02:10:53,056 --> 02:10:56,640
It becomes Crystal Clear when you hear I'm trying to do this 2009 style Ranch

2590
02:10:56,896 --> 02:10:58,688
That we've seen over the course of this episode

2591
02:10:58,944 --> 02:11:00,992
But he's doing it with his 2019 bring

2592
02:11:01,504 --> 02:11:02,016
You can't do it any

2593
02:11:03,296 --> 02:11:09,184
I can't weave is I'm above politics bulshit after spending three plus years defending everything Republican members of

2594
02:11:09,440 --> 02:11:12,768
The government and literally making Democrat and Global is synonymous

2595
02:11:13,280 --> 02:11:14,560
He was always lying

2596
02:11:14,816 --> 02:11:16,352
Thruway whatever pretense he had

2597
02:11:16,608 --> 02:11:19,680
A decade ago to ride the big wave with Rodger

2598
02:11:19,936 --> 02:11:21,728
Unfortunately that party is

2599
02:11:21,984 --> 02:11:22,496
F****** over

2600
02:11:23,008 --> 02:11:27,872
Rogers signal that he's willing to talk to Mueller which undercuts literally all of the narratives Alex

2601
02:11:28,128 --> 02:11:29,408
About their interact

2602
02:11:30,176 --> 02:11:31,712
Rodger keeps going on Fox Road

2603
02:11:31,968 --> 02:11:33,760
Laura Ingraham

2604
02:11:34,784 --> 02:11:35,552
Because he can

2605
02:11:36,320 --> 02:11:37,344
He's a hot item

2606
02:11:37,600 --> 02:11:38,624
And Alex knows the keys

2607
02:11:38,880 --> 02:11:39,392
Old Navy

2608
02:11:40,416 --> 02:11:41,696
And Alex cannot go home

2609
02:11:42,976 --> 02:11:44,000
F****** fund

2610
02:11:44,256 --> 02:11:44,768
Pry

2611
02:11:50,912 --> 02:11:51,680
Alright

2612
02:11:53,728 --> 02:11:54,752
And I think it's really interest

2613
02:11:55,520 --> 02:11:57,056
Because I don't I don't think

2614
02:11:57,312 --> 02:11:57,824
Pecan

2615
02:11:58,080 --> 02:11:58,592
Make it work

2616
02:11:58,848 --> 02:11:59,360
But

2617
02:11:59,872 --> 02:12:01,920
Whether or not I think he can pull it off

2618
02:12:02,176 --> 02:12:03,456
Just based on how I don't think any

2619
02:12:03,712 --> 02:12:04,224
Pull it off

2620
02:12:04,480 --> 02:12:05,248
Nope

2621
02:12:05,504 --> 02:12:07,552
That doesn't mean I'm not still super

2622
02:12:08,576 --> 02:12:11,136
That's more what I'm really interested

2623
02:12:11,392 --> 02:12:13,952
Because of back two more like

2624
02:12:14,208 --> 02:12:15,488
Actually trying

2625
02:12:15,744 --> 02:12:18,048
On his show as opposed to being just a

2626
02:12:18,304 --> 02:12:18,816
Deflection artist

2627
02:12:20,608 --> 02:12:21,632
It's always better for me

2628
02:12:22,144 --> 02:12:23,424
I met at the same time

2629
02:12:23,680 --> 02:12:25,216
I don't think that we've ever seen

2630
02:12:26,240 --> 02:12:27,776
Play calyx in Salvage

2631
02:12:28,032 --> 02:12:28,544
Bridge mode

2632
02:12:28,800 --> 02:12:30,592
And I think that's what he's going to have to be

2633
02:12:30,848 --> 02:12:32,384
Moving forward

2634
02:12:32,640 --> 02:12:34,944
I think it's going to be slow moving ICE I definitely think

2635
02:12:35,200 --> 02:12:37,504
It's going to take a little while for it to really

2636
02:12:37,760 --> 02:12:39,808
Take hold but it's the same sort of thing that we saw

2637
02:12:40,064 --> 02:12:40,576
We came into

2638
02:12:41,088 --> 02:12:43,392
In the late summer fall

2639
02:12:43,648 --> 02:12:44,416
Into the winter

2640
02:12:44,672 --> 02:12:47,488
2015 Slow Burn

2641
02:12:47,744 --> 02:12:48,512
Where there was being

2642
02:12:48,768 --> 02:12:49,280
Introduction of

2643
02:12:49,536 --> 02:12:50,048
Seems

2644
02:12:50,304 --> 02:12:51,840
The gradual

2645
02:12:52,096 --> 02:12:53,120
Warming of the water

2646
02:12:53,376 --> 02:12:57,984
It's up to the point where the listeners didn't realize it was boiling they were

2647
02:12:58,240 --> 02:12:59,008
I think you doing

2648
02:12:59,264 --> 02:13:01,312
Sort of a similar thing but in Reverse now

2649
02:13:01,568 --> 02:13:03,360
And because we have such an awareness

2650
02:13:03,616 --> 02:13:04,128
Cursive Alex

2651
02:13:04,640 --> 02:13:05,408
How he works

2652
02:13:05,920 --> 02:13:10,528
How we operate from days here in January 2019

2653
02:13:11,808 --> 02:13:12,832
Deescalate

2654
02:13:13,088 --> 02:13:13,856
Boiling water

2655
02:13:14,624 --> 02:13:17,184
Not necessarily to let people out of the pot

2656
02:13:17,952 --> 02:13:23,072
I don't know how to work make that metaphor work honestly in reverse

2657
02:13:23,840 --> 02:13:24,864
Like

2658
02:13:25,120 --> 02:13:28,960
The closest would be out of the frying-pan into the fire but even then

2659
02:13:31,520 --> 02:13:33,056
What are the things I'm super interested in

2660
02:13:33,568 --> 02:13:37,152
And because we recording this here on Thursday I don't have access to

2661
02:13:37,664 --> 02:13:38,688
Much more

2662
02:13:39,200 --> 02:13:40,992
The Wednesday was kind of boring

2663
02:13:42,016 --> 02:13:42,528
Big picture

2664
02:13:43,040 --> 02:13:45,600
But I'm interested to see where he goes

2665
02:13:46,368 --> 02:13:46,880
Like

2666
02:13:47,136 --> 02:13:50,208
He has people like Owen Benjamin who are hosting 4th hour

2667
02:13:50,464 --> 02:13:52,000
And to me that's kind of funny

2668
02:13:56,864 --> 02:13:57,376
And not funny

2669
02:13:57,632 --> 02:13:58,144
Yeah but like

2670
02:13:58,400 --> 02:13:58,912
I don't see him

2671
02:14:00,448 --> 02:14:00,960
Bulldog

2672
02:14:01,984 --> 02:14:06,080
But if you were to get in with like let's save those people who do like Red Ice

2673
02:14:06,592 --> 02:14:10,944
Alex strong

2674
02:14:11,200 --> 02:14:11,968
Towards

2675
02:14:12,224 --> 02:14:13,504
Overt

2676
02:14:13,760 --> 02:14:17,088
Supremacist white nationalist

2677
02:14:17,344 --> 02:14:17,856
His

2678
02:14:22,208 --> 02:14:23,488
The other possibility

2679
02:14:23,744 --> 02:14:24,768
Is it we could see

2680
02:14:25,024 --> 02:14:25,536
A marked

2681
02:14:25,792 --> 02:14:26,816
Insurgent

2682
02:14:28,608 --> 02:14:30,144
To seem to have been laying low

2683
02:14:30,656 --> 02:14:32,192
People like Paul Craig Roberts

2684
02:14:32,448 --> 02:14:33,216
People like

2685
02:14:33,472 --> 02:14:33,984
Peter Schiff

2686
02:14:34,240 --> 02:14:37,568
We could see a lot of these guys who are really prominent figures in 20

2687
02:14:37,824 --> 02:14:41,408
15 start the show back up as Alex tries to refocus

2688
02:14:41,664 --> 02:14:42,688
On the Federal Reserve

2689
02:14:42,944 --> 02:14:44,992
The globalist it being

2690
02:14:45,248 --> 02:14:46,016
Trump defense

2691
02:14:46,528 --> 02:14:47,296
Pilates guys

2692
02:14:47,552 --> 02:14:48,576
Who used to be his like

2693
02:14:48,832 --> 02:14:49,600
His sources

2694
02:14:50,624 --> 02:14:54,464
You can't go back to Webster Tarpley can't go back to pechenik

2695
02:14:54,720 --> 02:14:55,744
But he has options

2696
02:14:56,256 --> 02:14:57,024
From his old

2697
02:14:57,280 --> 02:14:58,048
Roster

2698
02:14:58,304 --> 02:15:00,352
If he apologizes to them and shows

2699
02:15:00,608 --> 02:15:02,144
He's not still just on

2700
02:15:02,400 --> 02:15:03,168
Trumps

2701
02:15:03,680 --> 02:15:07,008
Right I think that's one possibility that I'd be interested in seeing

2702
02:15:09,056 --> 02:15:09,568
Cuz those people

2703
02:15:10,080 --> 02:15:14,688
Would take a real

2704
02:15:15,200 --> 02:15:16,224
The other possibility is

2705
02:15:17,760 --> 02:15:18,784
Afraid of

2706
02:15:19,296 --> 02:15:21,344
But I think would be more interesting

2707
02:15:22,112 --> 02:15:23,904
Amatis Alex going to

2708
02:15:24,160 --> 02:15:24,672
Overnight

2709
02:15:25,696 --> 02:15:26,976
We're just possible I don't know

2710
02:15:29,536 --> 02:15:31,584
That's the problem with not being able to go home again

2711
02:15:31,840 --> 02:15:34,400
Right because if he tries to go home to his old

2712
02:15:36,960 --> 02:15:37,728
Football back in the day

2713
02:15:41,056 --> 02:15:42,848
So trying to go back there is trying to

2714
02:15:43,104 --> 02:15:43,616
Create

2715
02:15:44,128 --> 02:15:44,640
A future that

2716
02:15:45,920 --> 02:15:47,200
It's a it's a warped

2717
02:15:47,456 --> 02:15:48,224
Diversion of the past

2718
02:15:48,736 --> 02:15:50,784
That will only make both parties

2719
02:15:51,552 --> 02:15:52,064
Disappointed

2720
02:15:53,344 --> 02:15:53,856
They're experiencing

2721
02:15:54,624 --> 02:15:55,648
I think I could lead him also

2722
02:15:55,904 --> 02:15:56,672
Towards

2723
02:15:59,488 --> 02:16:01,280
I don't know on the other hand

2724
02:16:01,536 --> 02:16:02,816
You could say that

2725
02:16:03,840 --> 02:16:04,864
Once again

2726
02:16:05,120 --> 02:16:06,656
An inside

2727
02:16:06,912 --> 02:16:07,680
Into the weakest

2728
02:16:08,704 --> 02:16:09,984
You know like Alex

2729
02:16:10,240 --> 02:16:11,776
Was so hard into

2730
02:16:12,032 --> 02:16:12,544
Trump

2731
02:16:13,056 --> 02:16:14,592
Now his

2732
02:16:14,848 --> 02:16:15,616
Pivot has to

2733
02:16:16,128 --> 02:16:16,640
Sofa

2734
02:16:17,664 --> 02:16:18,432
Where is you

2735
02:16:18,688 --> 02:16:20,736
People like Fox News where they're starting to

2736
02:16:20,992 --> 02:16:21,760
To to be like

2737
02:16:22,528 --> 02:16:24,832
Maybe we shouldn't sky and

2738
02:16:25,088 --> 02:16:26,368
Because they were

2739
02:16:26,624 --> 02:16:27,136
They were

2740
02:16:27,392 --> 02:16:29,184
Far more gradual to it and

2741
02:16:29,696 --> 02:16:30,208
Still attempted to

2742
02:16:30,976 --> 02:16:31,488
Mitigated

2743
02:16:33,536 --> 02:16:34,560
Decline is going to

2744
02:16:36,096 --> 02:16:37,120
Similarly slower

2745
02:16:38,144 --> 02:16:40,448
I don't want to disagree with you necessarily because of

2746
02:16:40,704 --> 02:16:41,472
Thank you Isaac

2747
02:16:41,728 --> 02:16:42,496
Your ideas

2748
02:16:46,080 --> 02:16:48,128
I think that Alex has to be

2749
02:16:49,920 --> 02:16:50,432
When they jump

2750
02:16:50,688 --> 02:16:52,736
Could go much harder Road 92

2751
02:16:53,760 --> 02:16:55,808
I think they could take a pivot really

2752
02:16:56,576 --> 02:16:58,368
And I think people would kind of nuts

2753
02:17:00,416 --> 02:17:00,928
The Flash

2754
02:17:01,184 --> 02:17:01,696
Graphics

2755
02:17:01,952 --> 02:17:02,976
Production design

2756
02:17:03,232 --> 02:17:04,512
Their ability to distract

2757
02:17:04,768 --> 02:17:06,304
And the fact that they're better at their jobs

2758
02:17:06,816 --> 02:17:09,888
Restaurant

2759
02:17:10,400 --> 02:17:14,240
The any of them they do an hour show that edited it's not live

2760
02:17:14,496 --> 02:17:15,520
The reading script

2761
02:17:16,032 --> 02:17:16,544
There is like

2762
02:17:17,056 --> 02:17:18,848
There's always graphics on the screen

2763
02:17:19,360 --> 02:17:20,896
There's an ability for them to make hard

2764
02:17:21,152 --> 02:17:22,944
Returns that sometimes people don't

2765
02:17:23,456 --> 02:17:24,480
Experience as being

2766
02:17:24,736 --> 02:17:26,016
Hard because they're distracted

2767
02:17:26,784 --> 02:17:27,808
Most of the people who were listening

2768
02:17:28,064 --> 02:17:29,600
Alex just have his word

2769
02:17:30,112 --> 02:17:32,672
After watching the video it's not like they have

2770
02:17:33,440 --> 02:17:34,208
Tyronza

2771
02:17:34,976 --> 02:17:35,488
You know like

2772
02:17:36,000 --> 02:17:40,096
Good graphics up everywhere on it like alcohol for the document

2773
02:17:40,352 --> 02:17:42,400
And then you get to see a piece of paper on his desk

2774
02:17:42,656 --> 02:17:43,168
That's good stuff

2775
02:17:43,424 --> 02:17:44,448
It's not that great

2776
02:17:44,960 --> 02:17:47,520
Ability to serve

2777
02:17:47,776 --> 02:17:48,288
Hypnotize

2778
02:17:49,568 --> 02:17:50,848
Ikea's just his word

2779
02:17:51,360 --> 02:17:51,872
To go on

2780
02:17:52,128 --> 02:17:52,896
I don't know

2781
02:17:53,152 --> 02:17:54,176
You could be right or at

2782
02:17:55,456 --> 02:17:58,784
I don't know I don't think either of us position on it

2783
02:18:00,576 --> 02:18:04,416
Interesting but actually think is impossible is the idea that Alex

2784
02:18:04,928 --> 02:18:06,208
Become a voice of like

2785
02:18:06,976 --> 02:18:08,000
We lost our way

2786
02:18:08,256 --> 02:18:10,560
Or something like that

2787
02:18:10,816 --> 02:18:12,096
I think that I think that there would be

2788
02:18:12,608 --> 02:18:13,376
Some value

2789
02:18:16,448 --> 02:18:18,240
Sort of like

2790
02:18:18,496 --> 02:18:19,520
How do you get to the

2791
02:18:19,776 --> 02:18:20,800
The place necessarily

2792
02:18:21,056 --> 02:18:22,336
But some sort of like penitence

2793
02:18:23,104 --> 02:18:25,152
We lost our way we had our principles

2794
02:18:25,664 --> 02:18:29,248
Ron Paul's who I always loved and I get seduced away from it

2795
02:18:29,760 --> 02:18:31,040
Could even go with his

2796
02:18:31,296 --> 02:18:32,576
Hero's journey

2797
02:18:36,928 --> 02:18:37,696
It seemed like the right thing

2798
02:18:37,952 --> 02:18:40,256
Do it seemed like the best way to attack the globalist

2799
02:18:40,512 --> 02:18:42,560
This guy Rodger Stone f****** over

2800
02:18:42,816 --> 02:18:46,656
He's going to prison I've seen the error of my ways I know you was lying to me the whole time

2801
02:18:47,168 --> 02:18:47,936
I beg of you

2802
02:18:48,448 --> 02:18:49,984
I'm a voice in the wilderness

2803
02:18:50,240 --> 02:18:50,752
Do you saying

2804
02:18:51,008 --> 02:18:51,520
We

2805
02:18:51,776 --> 02:18:52,288
Stocked up

2806
02:18:52,800 --> 02:18:54,336
Do you remember how great it was when the

2807
02:18:54,592 --> 02:18:55,360
Tea party was going

2808
02:18:55,872 --> 02:18:57,664
Do you remember how much life

2809
02:18:57,920 --> 02:19:00,736
We felt in that midterms

2810
02:19:00,992 --> 02:19:03,296
In 2010 when we started the game seat

2811
02:19:03,552 --> 02:19:04,320
Do you remember what it's

2812
02:19:04,576 --> 02:19:06,112
Felt like to have this resurgence

2813
02:19:06,368 --> 02:19:07,136
End the Fed

2814
02:19:07,648 --> 02:19:08,672
Text

2815
02:19:08,928 --> 02:19:11,232
Dies

2816
02:19:11,744 --> 02:19:14,816
We didn't know what we were doing we got LED down the wrong road

2817
02:19:15,072 --> 02:19:16,864
And I'm begging you to come back

2818
02:19:17,120 --> 02:19:17,888
Comeback

2819
02:19:18,656 --> 02:19:22,496
But I think I'll be interesting as a character

2820
02:19:22,752 --> 02:19:23,264
Actually say

2821
02:19:23,520 --> 02:19:25,312
Your best move there

2822
02:19:26,592 --> 02:19:27,616
We did this

2823
02:19:28,128 --> 02:19:28,640
For the right

2824
02:19:28,896 --> 02:19:30,944
Reason

2825
02:19:32,480 --> 02:19:33,504
Supreme Court Justice

2826
02:19:34,528 --> 02:19:35,040
You know like

2827
02:19:35,296 --> 02:19:36,832
Hey well say what you

2828
02:19:37,088 --> 02:19:42,720
You want steak

2829
02:19:42,976 --> 02:19:44,768
Deck but all of them

2830
02:19:45,792 --> 02:19:46,560
Get a winner

2831
02:19:47,584 --> 02:19:48,352
Sure

2832
02:19:48,608 --> 02:19:49,632
What we elected was

2833
02:19:50,144 --> 02:19:50,912
F****** moron

2834
02:19:51,168 --> 02:19:52,448
Guess what

2835
02:19:52,960 --> 02:19:53,472
We got to

2836
02:19:53,728 --> 02:19:54,240
Supreme Court Justice

2837
02:19:55,008 --> 02:19:56,032
We got the

2838
02:19:56,288 --> 02:19:59,104
Absolute destruction of the Consumer Financial Protection

2839
02:20:03,456 --> 02:20:04,224
Victory out of the jaws of death

2840
02:20:04,480 --> 02:20:06,016
A little bit

2841
02:20:08,576 --> 02:20:09,344
Character

2842
02:20:10,368 --> 02:20:11,648
What cuz I think that's

2843
02:20:11,904 --> 02:20:12,416
Interesting

2844
02:20:12,928 --> 02:20:13,696
Voice

2845
02:20:13,952 --> 02:20:15,232
Yeah

2846
02:20:15,488 --> 02:20:17,280
To embody

2847
02:20:17,792 --> 02:20:20,352
Astonishing

2848
02:20:20,608 --> 02:20:22,656
Sort of logical but unlikely progression

2849
02:20:22,912 --> 02:20:23,424
Yeah

2850
02:20:23,936 --> 02:20:25,216
I think most likely

2851
02:20:25,472 --> 02:20:26,496
Severe

2852
02:20:26,752 --> 02:20:27,520
Radicalization

2853
02:20:28,032 --> 02:20:28,544
Because

2854
02:20:29,056 --> 02:20:30,080
Him trying to go home isn't

2855
02:20:31,104 --> 02:20:32,384
Nothing is going to have to try and find

2856
02:20:32,640 --> 02:20:33,152
The new home

2857
02:20:33,664 --> 02:20:34,176
New home

2858
02:20:34,944 --> 02:20:35,968
In terms of the internet

2859
02:20:36,480 --> 02:20:39,808
Searcy sphere and all that world either got to go like

2860
02:20:40,064 --> 02:20:41,088
Qanon s*** that's

2861
02:20:41,600 --> 02:20:43,904
Clearly, he's not into

2862
02:20:44,416 --> 02:20:46,464
The only other world

2863
02:20:46,976 --> 02:20:47,744
Outright

2864
02:20:48,256 --> 02:20:48,768
Nationalist

2865
02:20:50,304 --> 02:20:50,816
And like

2866
02:20:51,072 --> 02:20:51,840
He believed

2867
02:20:52,096 --> 02:20:52,608
The same thing

2868
02:20:53,632 --> 02:20:54,144
He just

2869
02:20:54,912 --> 02:20:56,704
Yeah he's outclassed

2870
02:20:57,216 --> 02:21:00,544
Because he's still not going to be able to do white nationalism as good as

2871
02:21:03,104 --> 02:21:04,640
Nobody does have a bigger platform

2872
02:21:04,896 --> 02:21:06,944
A lot of them

2873
02:21:07,456 --> 02:21:09,504
And they would hero worship him because of that game

2874
02:21:09,760 --> 02:21:11,552
Beekeeper issue

2875
02:21:11,808 --> 02:21:12,320
Millions of

2876
02:21:12,576 --> 02:21:13,856
True

2877
02:21:14,112 --> 02:21:15,648
So I think there's a possibility there

2878
02:21:15,904 --> 02:21:16,928
I don't know it's only answer

2879
02:21:17,184 --> 02:21:18,976
It's always difficult for us to try and

2880
02:21:19,232 --> 02:21:21,280
Predict the future

2881
02:21:22,560 --> 02:21:24,096
Speculate a little but like

2882
02:21:24,608 --> 02:21:26,656
We can only go on what he saying in the present

2883
02:21:26,912 --> 02:21:27,424
Provide Conte

2884
02:21:27,680 --> 02:21:28,192
Text that we have from

2885
02:21:28,960 --> 02:21:29,728
Of course now

2886
02:21:30,240 --> 02:21:32,288
We have a couple more Clips here from the 29th

2887
02:21:32,544 --> 02:21:33,568
Which again is Tuesday

2888
02:21:34,592 --> 02:21:36,128
On this show Alex's

2889
02:21:36,384 --> 02:21:37,152
Clearly

2890
02:21:37,664 --> 02:21:39,200
Syndicated Rodger Stone

2891
02:21:41,248 --> 02:21:42,784
Alex wants to go back

2892
02:21:43,296 --> 02:21:44,064
He wants to be where he

2893
02:21:44,320 --> 02:21:45,088
Felt comfortable

2894
02:21:45,344 --> 02:21:46,880
Before his identity wasn't

2895
02:21:47,136 --> 02:21:47,904
Tight prom

2896
02:21:48,416 --> 02:21:49,440
You can talk about all the stuff

2897
02:21:49,696 --> 02:21:51,488
He's always

2898
02:21:51,744 --> 02:21:52,768
He wants to be that again

2899
02:21:54,048 --> 02:21:56,352
And I wouldn't take it all that seriously

2900
02:21:57,120 --> 02:21:57,632
Probably

2901
02:21:58,144 --> 02:21:59,168
I guess he's a liar

2902
02:21:59,424 --> 02:22:00,960
And it even made

2903
02:22:04,544 --> 02:22:05,056
The sort of things that

2904
02:22:05,312 --> 02:22:06,080
You think you're seeing

2905
02:22:06,336 --> 02:22:07,104
In him

2906
02:22:08,640 --> 02:22:12,480
You can trick yourself if you're giving like a generous reading

2907
02:22:12,736 --> 02:22:13,760
Of what he saying

2908
02:22:14,272 --> 02:22:15,040
Yourself into thinking like

2909
02:22:15,296 --> 02:22:16,576
Oh isn't that interesting

2910
02:22:17,600 --> 02:22:19,904
What sealed the deal for me is this

2911
02:22:20,672 --> 02:22:22,464
Interview

2912
02:22:22,976 --> 02:22:23,488
On the 29th

2913
02:22:48,832 --> 02:22:50,368
Report.com

2914
02:22:53,184 --> 02:22:54,464
In 2020

2915
02:22:56,512 --> 02:22:59,328
What's behind this idea is William getting one of us

2916
02:23:08,800 --> 02:23:12,896
Continue what you doing

2917
02:23:15,712 --> 02:23:16,736
Had on in years

2918
02:23:17,248 --> 02:23:18,784
He's a guy named William

2919
02:23:19,040 --> 02:23:20,576
Who runs this

2920
02:23:22,112 --> 02:23:24,160
The American legal immigration

2921
02:23:24,416 --> 02:23:25,696
Political action

2922
02:23:26,720 --> 02:23:29,792
Luciferous anti-immigration

2923
02:23:30,560 --> 02:23:31,840
He is a super

2924
02:23:33,120 --> 02:23:34,400
Keep them out

2925
02:23:34,656 --> 02:23:36,960
Brown's out

2926
02:23:38,752 --> 02:23:39,776
He wrote an article

2927
02:23:40,032 --> 02:23:40,800
About wanting

2928
02:23:42,336 --> 02:23:43,616
The primary Trump

2929
02:23:43,872 --> 02:23:44,640
In 2020

2930
02:23:45,664 --> 02:23:46,944
Alex would never

2931
02:23:47,456 --> 02:23:49,248
Have this person on his show

2932
02:23:50,016 --> 02:23:51,552
If you still had any

2933
02:23:52,064 --> 02:23:52,576
Interest

2934
02:23:53,088 --> 02:23:54,368
In being a part of

2935
02:23:55,904 --> 02:23:56,672
Can't imagine

2936
02:23:57,696 --> 02:23:58,720
Anybody who voices

2937
02:23:59,488 --> 02:24:01,280
Milquetoast criticism of trump

2938
02:24:01,536 --> 02:24:02,816
Alex

2939
02:24:09,472 --> 02:24:11,008
Valid criticisms

2940
02:24:11,520 --> 02:24:12,032
Do not exist

2941
02:24:12,288 --> 02:24:14,336
Or even invalid criticism

2942
02:24:14,848 --> 02:24:16,128
Once given

2943
02:24:16,640 --> 02:24:17,664
You never give time

2944
02:24:18,688 --> 02:24:19,200
To criticism

2945
02:24:19,712 --> 02:24:20,224
Trump

2946
02:24:20,480 --> 02:24:21,248
Without challenge

2947
02:24:22,272 --> 02:24:22,784
Hacking

2948
02:24:23,040 --> 02:24:24,064
The person who's delivering

2949
02:24:24,832 --> 02:24:26,624
William goes on the show

2950
02:24:27,136 --> 02:24:27,648
Listen to this

2951
02:24:28,416 --> 02:24:31,744
Doesn't mean I really don't want Trump to win the election

2952
02:24:32,000 --> 02:24:35,328
Running

2953
02:24:41,728 --> 02:24:43,008
Mary

2954
02:24:49,664 --> 02:24:50,432
What I'm doing right now

2955
02:24:59,392 --> 02:25:05,536
Wow

2956
02:25:13,728 --> 02:25:16,800
He feels betrayed by Trump and he'll never vote for him again

2957
02:25:17,312 --> 02:25:19,872
Alex wouldn't let this on his show a month ago

2958
02:25:22,944 --> 02:25:26,528
And even the idea that he's starting out this interview by saying

2959
02:25:26,784 --> 02:25:32,928
Back in line

2960
02:25:33,952 --> 02:25:38,304
Reposted

2961
02:25:38,816 --> 02:25:40,352
He wouldn't think that that was the

2962
02:25:40,608 --> 02:25:41,120
The promise

2963
02:25:41,632 --> 02:25:42,912
He knows who this guy is

2964
02:25:43,936 --> 02:25:44,960
This strikes me

2965
02:25:47,520 --> 02:25:48,288
Soft

2966
02:25:48,544 --> 02:25:49,056
No

2967
02:25:49,312 --> 02:25:50,080
The first

2968
02:25:50,336 --> 02:25:51,360
Production meeting

2969
02:25:51,616 --> 02:25:52,128
Infowars

2970
02:25:52,384 --> 02:25:52,896
Has had in

2971
02:25:54,432 --> 02:25:55,712
Like legit

2972
02:25:56,224 --> 02:25:58,016
This is when Alex got

2973
02:25:58,272 --> 02:25:58,784
Together with

2974
02:25:59,040 --> 02:25:59,552
Dad

2975
02:25:59,808 --> 02:26:00,320
And Buckeye

2976
02:26:01,088 --> 02:26:02,112
And they for real talk

2977
02:26:02,368 --> 02:26:03,904
Volume

2978
02:26:04,160 --> 02:26:04,928
We can

2979
02:26:05,440 --> 02:26:05,952
Do this any

2980
02:26:06,976 --> 02:26:08,000
Find me a guy

2981
02:26:08,512 --> 02:26:09,024
Who's going

2982
02:26:09,536 --> 02:26:10,048
Say

2983
02:26:10,816 --> 02:26:11,840
We're the most

2984
02:26:12,352 --> 02:26:13,632
Whatever it is we think

2985
02:26:13,888 --> 02:26:14,400
We are

2986
02:26:14,656 --> 02:26:15,424
And Trump is

2987
02:26:15,680 --> 02:26:16,192
Not bad

2988
02:26:16,960 --> 02:26:17,728
We didn't bring

2989
02:26:17,984 --> 02:26:19,776
Bring us to the party

2990
02:26:20,032 --> 02:26:21,568
Zebra

2991
02:26:22,080 --> 02:26:23,872
It's exactly

2992
02:26:25,664 --> 02:26:27,200
Alex is allowing this guy to

2993
02:26:28,736 --> 02:26:31,296
On the show because because it's

2994
02:26:32,832 --> 02:26:33,344
Yet

2995
02:26:33,600 --> 02:26:36,416
Introduced into the rhetoric of his show

2996
02:26:36,928 --> 02:26:37,952
Yeah very important

2997
02:26:38,976 --> 02:26:39,488
Being able to

2998
02:26:40,256 --> 02:26:41,280
Being able to transition

2999
02:26:41,792 --> 02:26:42,304
Have this

3000
02:26:42,816 --> 02:26:45,632
On a hostile conversation with someone who's like

3001
02:26:45,888 --> 02:26:47,424
F*** it Trump abandoned us

3002
02:26:47,936 --> 02:26:51,008
I've always been a liar I was I loved it

3003
02:26:51,520 --> 02:26:52,288
In the campaign

3004
02:26:52,544 --> 02:26:53,568
Hear stuff I love to

3005
02:26:53,824 --> 02:26:56,640
Here I love that and that's why we voted

3006
02:26:57,408 --> 02:26:58,688
Now it's unfortunate

3007
02:26:59,200 --> 02:27:00,736
Because this guy William Dean

3008
02:27:01,248 --> 02:27:01,760
Big old piece

3009
02:27:02,016 --> 02:27:05,856
Nose Alexandria ocasio-cortez

3010
02:27:06,880 --> 02:27:08,416
Alright go f*** yourself

3011
02:27:08,672 --> 02:27:10,976
You don't make it more obvious that you

3012
02:27:11,488 --> 02:27:12,512
Do you know her name

3013
02:27:12,768 --> 02:27:18,912
Then when your legs hurt but I like that

3014
02:27:23,008 --> 02:27:27,104
100%

3015
02:27:27,360 --> 02:27:28,640
Terrified of her

3016
02:27:32,736 --> 02:27:33,504
It's important

3017
02:27:33,760 --> 02:27:35,296
The Alex is letting this on his show

3018
02:27:35,552 --> 02:27:36,576
That's super

3019
02:27:39,392 --> 02:27:41,952
At the end for Trump because I

3020
02:27:42,208 --> 02:27:42,976
I heard these things

3021
02:27:44,000 --> 02:27:44,512
The campaign

3022
02:27:44,768 --> 02:27:45,280
Inspired

3023
02:27:46,048 --> 02:27:47,840
And a lot of people would like to

3024
02:27:48,096 --> 02:27:48,608
Resent the idea

3025
02:27:51,168 --> 02:27:52,448
He said he's going to get out of the teepee

3026
02:27:52,704 --> 02:27:53,216
PP

3027
02:27:53,472 --> 02:27:55,008
He was going to fight the globalist

3028
02:27:55,520 --> 02:27:56,800
The Williams

3029
02:27:57,056 --> 02:27:57,824
A f****** dick

3030
02:27:58,080 --> 02:27:58,592
He said

3031
02:27:58,848 --> 02:28:02,432
We were going to have white

3032
02:28:02,688 --> 02:28:03,968
William jeanes.

3033
02:28:04,736 --> 02:28:10,880
We did not let Donald Trump

3034
02:28:13,440 --> 02:28:17,792
Wow you're bad

3035
02:28:23,680 --> 02:28:29,312
He's doing he's actually doing something 183

3036
02:28:29,568 --> 02:28:35,712
Wow read me just before the midterm election voters

3037
02:28:46,976 --> 02:28:49,792
Bigotry is disappointing to me

3038
02:28:50,048 --> 02:28:53,120
I heard during the campaign

3039
02:28:53,376 --> 02:28:54,912
Rampit white nationalist

3040
02:28:56,704 --> 02:28:58,240
We got

3041
02:28:58,496 --> 02:29:00,288
Bayou

3042
02:29:00,544 --> 02:29:02,592
Better getting a 100% whitener

3043
02:29:03,104 --> 02:29:09,248
Was we got like a 75% and the response here is interested

3044
02:29:09,504 --> 02:29:10,784
Because Alex is kind of like

3045
02:29:11,040 --> 02:29:11,808
Yeah you know what

3046
02:29:12,064 --> 02:29:12,832
You're right

3047
02:29:13,088 --> 02:29:13,856
You're right

3048
02:29:14,112 --> 02:29:20,256
Like there's a part at the end of the interview where Alex is even like yeah you know we're all caught up on the wall but just a misty issue is

3049
02:29:20,512 --> 02:29:22,816
Really more important

3050
02:29:23,328 --> 02:29:26,656
The others got to be still immigrants here the holy s*** out

3051
02:29:28,960 --> 02:29:35,104
So not only is this a very of jovial friendly interview with his guide

3052
02:29:35,360 --> 02:29:38,176
Central Primary B

3053
02:29:42,272 --> 02:29:47,392
Times embracing of but at other times

3054
02:29:51,488 --> 02:29:55,840
I would imagine that if we were to really go back through the archives you could find a lot of

3055
02:30:07,104 --> 02:30:13,248
For the cycle

3056
02:30:16,064 --> 02:30:18,112
I think what's important here is that I don't

3057
02:30:18,368 --> 02:30:19,136
Alex

3058
02:30:19,392 --> 02:30:19,904
Really

3059
02:30:20,160 --> 02:30:20,928
Necessarily

3060
02:30:21,440 --> 02:30:23,232
Sports

3061
02:30:23,744 --> 02:30:24,768
I think he's using him

3062
02:30:25,024 --> 02:30:25,536
As

3063
02:30:25,792 --> 02:30:26,816
More extreme

3064
02:30:27,328 --> 02:30:29,120
I guess

3065
02:30:29,376 --> 02:30:30,656
To have a moderate position

3066
02:30:30,912 --> 02:30:31,424
With work

3067
02:30:31,680 --> 02:30:32,192
Sing away from Trump

3068
02:30:35,008 --> 02:30:36,032
I think

3069
02:30:36,544 --> 02:30:37,056
I don't know

3070
02:30:38,848 --> 02:30:40,384
Like I can't sum it up better than

3071
02:30:40,896 --> 02:30:41,664
I hear Alec

3072
02:30:42,688 --> 02:30:43,456
This not

3073
02:30:43,968 --> 02:30:44,736
Anymore

3074
02:30:44,992 --> 02:30:46,528
What he's done

3075
02:30:46,784 --> 02:30:48,064
What he's been involved in

3076
02:30:49,088 --> 02:30:51,392
Like you just realizes that he's reached the end

3077
02:30:51,904 --> 02:30:53,696
The party's over the lights of come on

3078
02:30:54,208 --> 02:30:54,976
It's not fun

3079
02:30:55,232 --> 02:30:57,024
You're there until 5 in the morning

3080
02:30:59,840 --> 02:31:03,936
Everything's like fun in the morning

3081
02:31:04,192 --> 02:31:05,984
And then at 5 you still think it's fun

3082
02:31:06,240 --> 02:31:07,520
Lights come on realized

3083
02:31:07,776 --> 02:31:10,848
No one's dancing with you party is over

3084
02:31:11,104 --> 02:31:12,384
All your friends are gone

3085
02:31:12,640 --> 02:31:13,920
They don't like you anymore because

3086
02:31:14,176 --> 02:31:15,456
You punch them at 3 a.m.

3087
02:31:16,736 --> 02:31:17,504
You're just f*****

3088
02:31:17,760 --> 02:31:18,784
5 a.m.

3089
02:31:19,040 --> 02:31:20,832
And now you got a f****** sober up

3090
02:31:21,088 --> 02:31:22,368
You got to go get some Gatorade

3091
02:31:22,624 --> 02:31:23,136
Whatever

3092
02:31:25,952 --> 02:31:26,464
Figure it out

3093
02:31:26,720 --> 02:31:27,488
Get his life right

3094
02:31:28,512 --> 02:31:29,024
That's all

3095
02:31:31,072 --> 02:31:31,584
Tumi

3096
02:31:32,352 --> 02:31:33,632
Compared to the Isis

3097
02:31:43,360 --> 02:31:43,872
This

3098
02:31:44,128 --> 02:31:45,408
This is why

3099
02:31:45,664 --> 02:31:46,432
Production meeting

3100
02:31:46,944 --> 02:31:48,224
Part of it this is why that

3101
02:31:48,736 --> 02:31:50,784
Stripers

3102
02:31:51,552 --> 02:31:52,320
What I'm saying is

3103
02:31:52,576 --> 02:31:53,600
Tonight was

3104
02:31:53,856 --> 02:31:54,880
Emotional Ally

3105
02:31:55,392 --> 02:31:56,416
Shooting from the cup

3106
02:31:56,672 --> 02:31:58,976
Turn off that camera

3107
02:31:59,232 --> 02:32:01,536
Course when they go home the next day

3108
02:32:01,792 --> 02:32:03,584
The people around him were like

3109
02:32:04,096 --> 02:32:05,888
You can't do that we got to amend

3110
02:32:06,656 --> 02:32:07,424
Where is this

3111
02:32:07,680 --> 02:32:08,192
Turn

3112
02:32:08,448 --> 02:32:11,008
Is more likely to Natural because

3113
02:32:11,264 --> 02:32:11,776
Because

3114
02:32:12,032 --> 02:32:13,056
The people around him

3115
02:32:13,568 --> 02:32:14,336
Otherwise

3116
02:32:14,592 --> 02:32:15,104
Instead

3117
02:32:15,360 --> 02:32:16,896
No no no you can't be doing this

3118
02:32:17,408 --> 02:32:18,176
Are now saying

3119
02:32:18,944 --> 02:32:19,712
How do we

3120
02:32:20,736 --> 02:32:21,248
Not

3121
02:32:22,784 --> 02:32:23,552
How do we maneuver

3122
02:32:23,808 --> 02:32:24,320
Exact

3123
02:32:24,832 --> 02:32:26,624
We maneuver it by soft

3124
02:32:26,880 --> 02:32:28,672
Cutting off Rodger

3125
02:32:28,928 --> 02:32:35,072
It would serve nobody because he wasn't

3126
02:32:36,864 --> 02:32:37,888
Paul Watson

3127
02:32:48,896 --> 02:32:50,688
Purposes for him to come on araby like

3128
02:32:50,944 --> 02:32:57,088
Buck Rogers down the guide piece of s***

3129
02:33:03,744 --> 02:33:05,792
But that strategy would be a non-starter

3130
02:33:06,048 --> 02:33:08,608
So the idea of being like

3131
02:33:08,864 --> 02:33:10,400
I would assume

3132
02:33:11,936 --> 02:33:15,008
We're going to work through this

3133
02:33:15,264 --> 02:33:16,032
Foot f***

3134
02:33:16,544 --> 02:33:20,128
I imagine it has to be something like that because you receive is presented on the

3135
02:33:20,384 --> 02:33:21,664
It's consistent over the core

3136
02:33:22,176 --> 02:33:22,688
3 days ago

3137
02:33:22,944 --> 02:33:25,760
I am f****** sick and tired of being tied to these dudes

3138
02:33:26,272 --> 02:33:28,064
It's as close as it gets to lick a shoot

3139
02:33:28,320 --> 02:33:33,184
Promo promo

3140
02:33:33,440 --> 02:33:34,464
Rodger Stone

3141
02:33:35,744 --> 02:33:37,024
Is a severance package

3142
02:33:40,096 --> 02:33:41,888
It's amazing how much money we're giving

3143
02:33:42,144 --> 02:33:42,656
Birmingham Wallace

3144
02:33:42,912 --> 02:33:45,216
It's not hush money to like

3145
02:33:48,288 --> 02:33:49,312
Like slander

3146
02:33:49,568 --> 02:33:52,640
That's just kind of a good strategy

3147
02:33:52,896 --> 02:33:58,528
If you're working with Rodger Stone you don't even know if

3148
02:33:59,040 --> 02:33:59,552
Can make it through

3149
02:33:59,808 --> 02:34:00,832
Yeah

3150
02:34:01,088 --> 02:34:01,600
You can make

3151
02:34:01,856 --> 02:34:03,904
Get through if he's probably going to be in prison soon

3152
02:34:04,160 --> 02:34:07,744
That's when you bail out that's when you're free Alex's

3153
02:34:08,000 --> 02:34:09,024
Free in a way that

3154
02:34:09,280 --> 02:34:09,792
He hasn't been

3155
02:34:10,048 --> 02:34:12,864
For three years old my God the most important

3156
02:34:13,120 --> 02:34:15,680
The most important thing for Alex right now

3157
02:34:15,936 --> 02:34:17,216
Is whether or not Rodger

3158
02:34:17,472 --> 02:34:18,240
Stones gag order

3159
02:34:20,544 --> 02:34:21,056
Not really

3160
02:34:21,312 --> 02:34:23,872
I don't care

3161
02:34:24,384 --> 02:34:25,408
Obviously I was being

3162
02:34:28,480 --> 02:34:29,248
Does get info

3163
02:34:30,272 --> 02:34:30,784
Alex

3164
02:34:40,256 --> 02:34:42,048
Well Subway Subway

3165
02:34:42,304 --> 02:34:43,584
I mean if a quarter is

3166
02:34:44,096 --> 02:34:44,864
Enforce them

3167
02:34:45,376 --> 02:34:46,912
Is free to just move on

3168
02:34:47,168 --> 02:34:50,240
You have to be afraid of whatever Rodger might do

3169
02:34:50,496 --> 02:34:52,288
I'm up to like

3170
02:34:52,800 --> 02:34:53,824
Cell Rodger

3171
02:34:54,080 --> 02:34:55,104
Out

3172
02:34:55,360 --> 02:34:57,408
Sing like that

3173
02:34:58,432 --> 02:34:59,200
I think that there is

3174
02:34:59,456 --> 02:35:04,576
Interesting

3175
02:35:04,832 --> 02:35:08,160
Plies our gullibility

3176
02:35:08,416 --> 02:35:09,440
Weakness in himself

3177
02:35:10,720 --> 02:35:12,768
Right

3178
02:35:14,304 --> 02:35:14,816
What's that like

3179
02:35:15,584 --> 02:35:16,352
Rogers

3180
02:35:16,608 --> 02:35:18,144
Railroaded by the globalist

3181
02:35:18,400 --> 02:35:23,264
Right now let's talk exclusively about the globalists fucktrump who gives a s*** about him

3182
02:35:23,520 --> 02:35:25,312
Like you can still maintain

3183
02:35:25,824 --> 02:35:26,848
A flimsy

3184
02:35:27,360 --> 02:35:29,152
Formative support for Rodger Stone

3185
02:35:29,664 --> 02:35:30,176
Panda panda

3186
02:35:30,688 --> 02:35:32,992
You can do all of the things you need to do

3187
02:35:33,248 --> 02:35:33,760
For sure

3188
02:35:34,016 --> 02:35:37,088
It's a but you can't do them if Rodger still has influence over

3189
02:35:37,600 --> 02:35:38,880
And when Rodger goes to

3190
02:35:39,136 --> 02:35:39,904
Prison or

3191
02:35:40,160 --> 02:35:41,440
Is on his way to prison

3192
02:35:41,952 --> 02:35:42,464
You are free

3193
02:35:42,720 --> 02:35:46,816
That's what that's what I'm saying

3194
02:35:47,072 --> 02:35:48,096
Component

3195
02:35:48,864 --> 02:35:49,376
Man

3196
02:35:49,632 --> 02:35:53,216
The moment I don't have to look over my shoulder

3197
02:35:53,728 --> 02:35:54,496
You can't talk s*** about

3198
02:35:55,008 --> 02:35:56,288
Not yet

3199
02:35:56,544 --> 02:36:00,128
Play like it doesn't matter if I have any obligations

3200
02:36:00,384 --> 02:36:00,896
Lisa be like

3201
02:36:01,152 --> 02:36:04,224
For my audience I still support Rodger Stone

3202
02:36:04,480 --> 02:36:05,504
The moment I

3203
02:36:05,760 --> 02:36:07,296
Don't have to look over my shoulder

3204
02:36:07,552 --> 02:36:13,696
Is the moment I'm free

3205
02:36:13,952 --> 02:36:16,768
Agency over

3206
02:36:17,792 --> 02:36:20,864
I don't look I don't know what the future holds

3207
02:36:21,888 --> 02:36:22,400
This week

3208
02:36:22,912 --> 02:36:23,680
Have been Iowa

3209
02:36:24,192 --> 02:36:25,472
Like it really

3210
02:36:25,728 --> 02:36:28,032
It's difficult to listen to

3211
02:36:28,544 --> 02:36:29,056
I mean

3212
02:36:29,312 --> 02:36:31,104
Certainly there's a lot of stuff I had to look into

3213
02:36:31,360 --> 02:36:32,384
Like a lot of articles

3214
02:36:32,640 --> 02:36:33,152
Studies

3215
02:36:33,408 --> 02:36:34,432
Reports about vaccines

3216
02:36:34,944 --> 02:36:35,712
Because I wanted to talk

3217
02:36:35,968 --> 02:36:39,040
About that

3218
02:36:39,296 --> 02:36:39,808
When was the Emoji

3219
02:36:41,856 --> 02:36:42,880
It's it's

3220
02:36:43,136 --> 02:36:43,648
It's tough

3221
02:36:43,904 --> 02:36:44,416
I've not see

3222
02:36:45,184 --> 02:36:46,208
Like this from him in

3223
02:36:46,720 --> 02:36:47,744
In a long

3224
02:36:48,000 --> 02:36:48,512
Long f******

3225
02:36:49,280 --> 02:36:52,096
Not even the night where he cried and the dirty assholes

3226
02:36:52,352 --> 02:36:55,168
Not anything close to that

3227
02:36:55,424 --> 02:36:56,448
This is sincere

3228
02:36:56,704 --> 02:36:57,216
This is

3229
02:36:57,472 --> 02:36:57,984
Protracted

3230
02:36:59,520 --> 02:37:00,544
December 25th

3231
02:37:02,336 --> 02:37:05,152
If you'd say year of Our Lord dirty as a

3232
02:37:05,408 --> 02:37:08,480
Rodger Stone chefs Islip the dirty assholes

3233
02:37:08,736 --> 02:37:14,880
Or the equipment or the equivalent Rogers

3234
02:37:15,136 --> 02:37:17,696
Emotional

3235
02:37:17,952 --> 02:37:18,976
This is subdued

3236
02:37:19,488 --> 02:37:20,768
The natural

3237
02:37:21,024 --> 02:37:21,792
Have to it

3238
02:37:22,048 --> 02:37:23,072
And I think it indicates

3239
02:37:23,328 --> 02:37:24,096
Very strongly

3240
02:37:24,608 --> 02:37:25,632
That whatever happens

3241
02:37:25,888 --> 02:37:26,656
The next week or

3242
02:37:26,912 --> 02:37:27,424
Or whatever

3243
02:37:28,192 --> 02:37:28,704
He's done

3244
02:37:29,216 --> 02:37:30,752
Alex is done talking to Rodger

3245
02:37:31,008 --> 02:37:32,032
And having him run the

3246
02:37:32,288 --> 02:37:32,800
The show

3247
02:37:33,824 --> 02:37:34,592
Back to Alec

3248
02:37:35,360 --> 02:37:36,128
And we will see

3249
02:37:36,640 --> 02:37:37,920
Do you still able to do that

3250
02:37:38,176 --> 02:37:40,736
The problem with that prediction

3251
02:37:40,992 --> 02:37:44,832
Is that the way that your predictions

3252
02:37:46,368 --> 02:37:46,880
Episode

3253
02:37:47,392 --> 02:37:48,928
Belies are

3254
02:37:49,440 --> 02:37:50,976
Constant truth of

3255
02:37:51,488 --> 02:37:52,256
We think Alex

3256
02:37:52,512 --> 02:37:53,536
Who's going to do this thing

3257
02:37:53,792 --> 02:37:57,376
World's wrong

3258
02:38:02,240 --> 02:38:07,616
29-28

3259
02:38:07,872 --> 02:38:11,200
So predictable I meant metaphorical right

3260
02:38:11,712 --> 02:38:12,992
But if Alex is getting back

3261
02:38:13,248 --> 02:38:19,392
To where he was in days past unpredictable

3262
02:38:19,648 --> 02:38:20,416
I'm excited for that

3263
02:38:20,672 --> 02:38:22,208
You know what I like about Rodger

3264
02:38:22,464 --> 02:38:24,768
He reminds me so much of the Somali pirates

3265
02:38:27,072 --> 02:38:28,352
I hate Alex Jones

3266
02:38:29,376 --> 02:38:29,888
The piece of s***

3267
02:38:30,144 --> 02:38:31,168
The monster lights

3268
02:38:31,424 --> 02:38:31,936
Supremacist

3269
02:38:32,192 --> 02:38:32,960
Nationalist

3270
02:38:33,216 --> 02:38:34,240
A bigot of all order

3271
02:38:34,752 --> 02:38:35,776
Like

3272
02:38:36,032 --> 02:38:36,800
The monster is

3273
02:38:38,080 --> 02:38:38,848
Influence in society

3274
02:38:39,616 --> 02:38:40,128
But

3275
02:38:40,384 --> 02:38:41,664
That being said

3276
02:38:42,176 --> 02:38:43,712
I will always prefer

3277
02:38:44,224 --> 02:38:45,760
Free Trump Alec

3278
02:38:46,016 --> 02:38:46,784
To Trump Alex

3279
02:38:47,040 --> 02:38:47,552
100

3280
02:38:47,808 --> 02:38:50,880
There is a distinct difference between them

3281
02:38:51,136 --> 02:38:53,440
Not on an ethical

3282
02:38:53,696 --> 02:38:58,816
Put on a I'm interested in this

3283
02:38:59,584 --> 02:39:00,096
Alex is free

3284
02:39:00,608 --> 02:39:01,888
Like I want to go back to

3285
02:39:02,144 --> 02:39:03,168
To who I used to be

3286
02:39:03,680 --> 02:39:05,216
I'm never going to be against it

3287
02:39:07,264 --> 02:39:08,032
Metaphorically

3288
02:39:08,288 --> 02:39:10,848
Politico

3289
02:39:12,640 --> 02:39:13,152
Stupid you are

3290
02:39:13,408 --> 02:39:14,688
Thank you Alex

3291
02:39:15,200 --> 02:39:17,760
Thank you for indicating that you want to come back

3292
02:39:18,272 --> 02:39:18,784
2

3293
02:39:19,040 --> 02:39:22,112
Straight present-day episodes

3294
02:39:22,624 --> 02:39:26,464
Alex and the present day is so boring I want to go back to 2009

3295
02:39:26,720 --> 02:39:29,792
To straight episode

3296
02:39:30,816 --> 02:39:31,584
It's f***** up to

3297
02:39:31,840 --> 02:39:34,144
Because I have so many things that have been in the works and we have

3298
02:39:34,400 --> 02:39:39,264
We have other things that like we have been planning

3299
02:39:39,776 --> 02:39:43,360
And they all got thrown off by Rodger Stone

3300
02:39:44,128 --> 02:39:44,896
The timing of the world

3301
02:39:45,920 --> 02:39:46,944
It works

3302
02:39:47,200 --> 02:39:47,712
Serpentza

3303
02:39:48,480 --> 02:39:50,272
What time do just got to let go and let God

3304
02:39:52,320 --> 02:39:56,160
We have to accept what the episodes

3305
02:39:56,416 --> 02:39:57,184
We do will be what

3306
02:39:57,952 --> 02:40:00,256
We'll talk about it at the beginning of the next episode but if

3307
02:40:02,048 --> 02:40:02,816
If you're still listening

3308
02:40:03,072 --> 02:40:07,168
Next week we're only going to have the Monday and Friday episode I will be on vacation

3309
02:40:07,680 --> 02:40:09,216
I'm so pleased

3310
02:40:11,264 --> 02:40:11,776
Forgive us but

3311
02:40:13,824 --> 02:40:16,896
Back on Monday but until then

3312
02:40:17,408 --> 02:40:17,920

3314
02:40:19,712 --> 02:40:20,480
Alright

3315
02:40:20,736 --> 02:40:26,880
What if you do that

3316
02:40:29,696 --> 02:40:31,744
Earlier this week

3317
02:40:32,768 --> 02:40:33,792
Episode

3318
02:40:35,584 --> 02:40:38,144
And someone got sassy with them and eyes are

3319
02:40:38,400 --> 02:40:38,912
Responsible

3320
02:40:39,936 --> 02:40:46,080

Weird Beauty point where two years ago we started this a don't give a s***

We're expecting

3325
02:41:01,440 --> 02:41:02,976
I liked his show quite a bit

3326
02:41:03,488 --> 02:41:06,048
Is just out of nowhere recommending our show to pee

3327
02:41:06,560 --> 02:41:07,072
That's very cool

3328
02:41:07,328 --> 02:41:09,888
Very cool I couldn't have happened without all of you listen

3329
02:41:11,168 --> 02:41:16,288
And especially the members of our Facebook group

3330
02:41:16,544 --> 02:41:21,408
Tell your mother you're brilliant that's correct anywhere else on iTunes

3331
02:41:21,664 --> 02:41:22,176
Cooper
