Alex Jones  00:00
Andy in Kansas, you're on the air. Thanks for holding. So Alex, I'm a first time caller. I'm a huge fan. I love your work.

Dan  00:07
Hey, everybody, welcome back to knowledge fight. I'm Dan.

Jordan  00:10
I'm Jordan.

Dan  00:11
This is a show where I have watched way too much Infowars and Alex Jones in particular, and I sit down with my friend Jordan,

Jordan  00:18
who has no goddamn clue what he's talking about Jordan,

Dan  00:20
how are things?

Jordan  00:23
They're doing good.

Dan  00:24
Before we get to the business at hand, which today we're going to be going over the February 10 episode of the Alex Jones Show that was last Friday as this comes out. Okay. But before we get to that, there's a couple little bits of business we need to take care of. Absolutely. First of all, got a big old shout out to at randomly, Susanna on Twitter. What's up, Susanna, thank you so much. She

Jordan  00:47
made something very cute and very beautiful. And it made me cry.

Dan  00:50
Yep, that's right. We gotta cook over here. We'll see lib. tard cuck.

Jordan  00:54
That is me. That is me.

Dan  00:56
She made us a very nice drawing for a logo. Very awesome. Thank you so much. Really appreciate it. You can find that up on our new Tumblr, which is knowledge fight.tumblr.com. That's it another announcement. I had another announcement, but

Jordan  01:10
I forgot what it was regarding the David Knight episode.

Dan  01:13
Oh, yeah. We'd like to make a big apology that we put you through that.

Jordan  01:17
I know. I know. Plenty of you voiced your support.

Dan  01:21
I did hear from at least three people. But that was bullshit.

Jordan  01:24
Okay, good. Then plenty of you did not voice your your support. And we agree with you.

Dan  01:29
Yeah. Listen, David knights boring, man, we get it so boring. But we're back in the greener pastures of the real straight 100 proof. Alex Jones territory,

Jordan  01:43
the Everclear of Alex Jones,

Dan  01:45
what I like to do is I like to sit down and try and figure he will

Jordan  01:48
buy you a garden.

Dan  01:50
Oh, he'll buy you a new light.

Jordan  01:51
He'll buy you a new life. Yeah.

Dan  01:52
What I like to do is I like to sometimes try and figure out what the plot of a show is. A lot of times Alex Jones has something that's going on in his mind. And it sort of bleeds into every aspect becomes the narrative of the show. And this show. I really struggled with what it was. And I can't really find a synthesis like, and now I actually regret that I brought up the idea that

Jordan  02:23
he's so you just negated your entire premise there. I think if you think back to most of our shows, you can say yes and no, half the time, right. Well, there's a 5050 proposition.

Dan  02:36
I promise I didn't. I was just I'm trying to figure out a way to articulate this. I'm about to play a clip. And I want you to let it play. Do let's just listen to it. Because if he plays it three times, oh, wait, what he plays this clip three times back to back to back No, no. Throughout the show. For the last week, he's played in a whole bunch. Okay. And it's just insanity. These you loves this clip. And when we it's just it's propaganda.

Jordan  03:07
It's Russell Westbrook dunking on the guy right? I wish it was that clip.

Dan  03:11
No, it's that gorilla drinking. It's on piste. Let me play it. It's about it's about how it's a kitten that thinks it's a person it's about how fucking stupid Democrats are. All right, and we'll get back and I'll explain why I hate this clip so much in a minute Oh, this is how he

Jordan  03:34
opens the she has the 54321 Silent Movie era

Dan  03:38
that just to let you know this is how the fucking entire show Oh, every time No. Well, that yes. Okay, but this clip is how we opens Fridays. Oh, okay. Okay, so just cold open. Gotcha.

Congressman Hank Johnson  03:52
This is a island that at its widest level is what 12 miles from shore to shore. And at a smallest level or smallest location it's seven miles between one shore and the other. Is that correct?

General Robert Willard  04:22
I don't have the exact dimensions but to your point, sir, I think Guam is a small island

Congressman Hank Johnson  04:28
My fear is that the whole island will become so overly populated that it will tip over and capsize. 

Unknown Speaker  04:48
I stand here as a freed slave.

Jordan  04:50
That's how we open our show.

Nancy Pelosi  04:52
We can work. I can work with President Bush on and I'm disappointed because I thought that there might be some entry That's because of what he said in the campaign.

Unknown Speaker  05:02
What are we going to do? How can a president who is acting in the manner that he's acting, whether he's talking about the travel ban, the way that he's targeting Muslims, or whether he's talking about his relationship to Putin and the Kremlin, and knowing that they have hacked our D Triple C and DNC and knowing that he's responsible for supplying the bombs that killed innocent children and families and what is Aleppo? Yeah, in Aleppo you are correct. The fact that he is wrapping his arms around you is continuing to advance into Korea.

Unknown Speaker  06:06
Bing bing, bong, bong bing bing bing, stop it.

Alex Jones  06:10
I've decided we're gonna need all videos now with Bong Bong, bing, bing, bang, bang, bang. Better presents My like trouble. So hilarious.

Jordan  06:18
Alex, why did you ruin that for me? So I had fun with that. And then he did the thing that he did the racist thing. I was enjoying every moment of that.

Dan  06:28
I don't know if it was necessarily racist. How is that it's a video of Trump sort of pretending to play xylophone. bing, bong, bing, bong, bong, bong. I don't know what the context of that clip is. But I know what the context is. I think other clips will have to go racism. And now here's what I want to say. 100%. So that's a clip of I don't know who the Senator is who talks about Guam. But he wasn't literally talking about it tipping over. Right. It was it was metaphor. It was it was creative license, somewhat.

Jordan  06:58
Alex does not accept that from anybody but Alex. No. Now Furthermore, that is hilarious. Sure, sure. That would be a funny clip. I'm worried and frankly, in the context of American in the context of American history, it is not that far out of what we're used to know. I mean, even in John Quincy Adams thought the Earth was hollow. Yeah, yeah.

Dan  07:16
So you know, there's I would buy it was a lot of weird beliefs that a lot of people have held. Republicans don't

Jordan  07:21
believe climate change is real. I buy it. But then also that's less crazy than Guam tipping. Oh, this

Dan  07:27
guy doesn't think that. But then the other clip is Nancy Pelosi accidentally saying Bush when she met Trump, right? She's just a slip of the tongue. Yeah. But then the other ones are she was talking about her Bush, one senator saying or representative. I'm not entirely sure saying I stand here as a free slave. Obviously, that is metaphorical. Obviously. There's a reason that she's saying that she's not literally saying she was a slave. Yeah. Then Maxine Waters, forgetting Aleppo for a second and then remembering it, and then saying that Putin is invading Korea, she meant Crimea.

Jordan  08:02
Yeah. But Crimea.

Dan  08:04
She whatever Crimea.

Jordan  08:06
It's crying. That sounds like that sounds like it's in a graphic

Dan  08:10
novel or in like, it's it's

Jordan  08:12
the Crimea, great Theft Auto.

Dan  08:17
So but like, it's these, it's, it slips of the tongue that Alex has fucking latched onto and made this two and a half minute clip of and he just plays it non stop. Yeah, he plays it. We're gonna talk about this on the next episode, but he plays it during a John Rappaport special fantast to illuminate how dumb Democrats are. They're so dumb. And listen, here's the here's the bottom line. I don't fully disagree that Maxine Waters is a little batty. I don't disagree at all. We are liberal dudes here saying she's a little old. She doesn't have a lot of her facts in order. Maybe it's time for

Jordan  08:51
also she's out of touch and part of a Democratic establishment that is clearly fucked everything up for it right on their own.

Dan  08:59
But the the argument that she actually thinks that Putin is invading Korea, or she actually doesn't know Aleppo is is insane. Yeah. Especially the first one. The only

Jordan  09:11
person who doesn't know Aleppo is Gary Johnson. Right? Right. And they play

Dan  09:15
shots of him during that video too. and wonderful. And also the rest of it is like, like picture and picture. So there's like the two shots next to each other. It's the video playing. And then Alex sitting at the desk, Alex Jones sitting there just like just making real

Jordan  09:30
quizzical habit having his having a silent movie acting skills.

Dan  09:36
He's doing a silent movie acting real wonderful guy he's trying to, but anyway, I wanted to play that because that's how he starts the show and how he, he again, he plays it two more times throughout the course of the show, okay, I'm not gonna play it each time. He does, but he doesn't. He's fucking in love with this clip. And it's like,

Jordan  09:52
okay, he's proud of it. They put together a clip. It's got little backing music behind it, they edit it. I'm sure they edited it pretty It was pretty well

Dan  10:00
right it was Rob do behind the scenes our do

Jordan  10:03
our our doo dee doo Yeah. Good on him good on him. They they made a good clip.

Dan  10:13
But again, that's not journalism. That's propaganda. Yeah. So great, good way to start your show dickhole. He gets down to some substance here though in this next clip. And this next clip is what I would call the first lie of the show

Alex Jones  10:28
known as the ninth sharpish 80 plus percent of the time but a nightly show then reminded,

Jordan  10:35
I'm going to set a Ninth Circuit Judge, I believe is what he's referencing. And I hadn't said he uses

Dan  10:41
circuit the Ninth Circuit Court. It's the judges. Yes. But he's talking with the ones who saved our asses for a second. Yeah, he's he's mad at them. Yeah. And who would have guessed is what he said there was actually literally the first lie, but he has a bigger lie that's coming up that 80 plus percent of the time their decisions are overturned. That's not that's not even close to true. Well, actually, the truth is, it's 79%. Oh, no shit. Yeah. But but that's not the most overturned court in the land. That's okay. If they're like number three, it turns out that a lot of circuit court decisions are overturned. All

Jordan  11:17
right, is it? Is it an appellate court or is it the first? So it goes fuels court? It's it? Yeah, it's an appellate. So

Dan  11:24
the middle right before,

Jordan  11:25
right before the Supreme Court. Now, admittedly, the problem with all of our court system is that the ideal court system is impassioned, or no dispassionate observers of the code of robots. And instead, what we have is weird as random ideological bets from our court system. Sure. So we have a Supreme Court that isn't even really like it's a useless nonsense thing, right. Kind of a game. Yeah, it is. It what we saw, it's maneuvering pieces around. It's not an actual court.

Dan  11:58
Its fifth dimensional chess. Yeah.

Jordan  12:00
How is? How are we okay with the Supreme Court the way it is right now? The only one seems mind boggling to me. It's nuts. But

Dan  12:07
then I mean, even before the election, you had people like Ted Cruz, and other conservatives were like, well, it's possible that we just never if Hillary gets in, we'll just never vote for one. And then it'll eventually be down to like six justices, and then eventually we can just get rid of the Supreme Court. Yeah.

Jordan  12:23
Well, well, that whole system of checks and balances was, it was fine. Whenever people who disagreed with you were in power, but now that you're in power, you don't want that shit. No,

Dan  12:33
it's an impeachment. It may stop you. Yeah. But again, this guy I

Jordan  12:37
love I love Trump's complete and utter bafflement by the fact that this that a court can stop him will see you in court. He's not he's not angry about it. He's confused and enraged. Yeah, he didn't understand that that was possible. He didn't get Wait, wait, whoa, I signed an executive order. That means it's law forever right?

Dan  12:57
I'm supposed to be king right? Yeah,

Jordan  12:59
I'm King. I'm King Trump. I'm running this like a business where there's no Supreme Court to stop

Dan  13:03
you don't he needs to watch like real talk any memes any reality show he seems to love watching cartoons because he did watch he had Finding Dory that a screening of that at the White House. Okay, schedule.

Jordan  13:15
I'm not gonna judge you man for loving cartoons. I'm a big Miyazaki fan. Everybody follow our tunes are cool cartoons. If we Rick and Morty

Dan  13:23
if we if we want to go with this cartoon theme, I really recommend that he watched The Emperor's New Groove

Jordan  13:28
that is a great movie to showcase for Patrick Warburton being great, so great. He's so great. Oh, he's so great. But also we

Dan  13:37
would teach him a little bit about you know how being a dictator is not really cool and but learning about how the common man really lives is

Jordan  13:46
important to do now, I would also suggest he watches

Dan  13:51
Schoolhouse Rock rest in peace or the kip.

Jordan  13:54
Yeah. Schoolhouse Rock. Let's go with Magic School Bus. That's really important for him. Sure. Pretty sure he doesn't know how the human body works. Phantom Tollbooth Phantom Tollbooth. Absolutely. He doesn't even know how toll booths work Bridge

Dan  14:07
to Terabithia. No, he

Jordan  14:09
can leave that children's book Jumanji? He's got to get on that. Sure. That's important. What

Dan  14:14
was space Jumanji? Remember that movie?

Jordan  14:17
I thought that was Bridge to Terabithia.

Dan  14:19
How dare you? So anyway, let's get back to this clip about the Ninth Circuit Court and get to the actual lie. But the one that the lie of 80 plus percent is a slight exaggeration.

Jordan  14:31
But love it's 79%. He rounded up slightly but the not real. That's not an exaggeration. I'll give him that. But

Dan  14:37
that's not uncommon for appellate courts. Like thanks.

Jordan  14:41
Maybe your lie. Isn't that weird? Kind of that seems weird. To me. It that's a fact that I just found out that I am not actually comfortable with but

Dan  14:49
the reason is, a lot of the times when the Supreme Court implicitly agrees with the ruling, they would just reject the case. They take it Okay, well Like court standing

Jordan  15:01
rules. So the only reason that the Supreme Court would take a case is if there was a significant possibility that it would be overturned. Yes. Okay. Yes. They don't take most cases. And then of course, the reason that you would go to the Ninth Circuit Court is because it is like, the reason that Washington would go directly to that court is because it is a left leaning court. Maybe it has two judges appointed by Democratic presidents and one judge appointed by the G Dubs.

Dan  15:31
But what I'm saying I'm not sure about is I'm not sure how it works in terms of standing and what goes to what court I'm not entirely sure about that.

Jordan  15:39
The amount of knowledge I have about that is just enough knowledge to tell people the wrong things, right. Like I know all the words and then I'll put them in the wrong order and people will believe lies,

Dan  15:49
I will tell you this. It doesn't matter. To the case at hand or to that is a good point. Yeah. So do we always

Jordan  15:57
get bogged down in reality, whatever that has no bearing on what we're about to let's

Dan  16:01
get to the real life, okay?

Alex Jones  16:03
It's known as the ninth sharpish 80 Plus, some of the time but Buckley ran here before the show, and reminded me of something. That's right. It's the ninth circuit that multiple times has overturned lawsuits and agree with public schools chain the American flag is offensive and cannot be worn on any clothing period. How dare they wear death metal shirts, you can wear Satanism shards, your Islamic shirts, you can wear collared shirts, you can wear what Barraza Metro Mexican flag shirts, but you cannot wear the American flag according to the ninth circuit.

Jordan  16:41
I am gonna guess before you say a word before I perhaps before I tell you I have really looked up this particular circumstance did and maybe have some information relevant to it. And hey, I'm gonna go out on a limb. Perhaps it contradicts what it is that Alex Jones was saying the your bingo really? Yeah. Who would have guessed? So the Knights never happened before the Ninth

Dan  17:04
Circuit Court did rule in agreement with a lawsuit that was presented about people wearing the American flag. That part is true. Yes. What ended up happening was they ruled that people couldn't wear the American flag under certain circumstances, which I will explain in a moment. And then the Supreme Court refused to hear the case because there's like, No, this is this is fine. So what the actual case was was about people wearing student or, excuse me wearing the American flag on Cinco Demayo. Okay, now here's why. All

Jordan  17:40
right, controversy that seems automatically a little bit of like, Hey, we're reacting to your thing.

Dan  17:47
The controversy goes back to May 2009. An incident between two groups of students at Live Oak high school at a school sponsored Cinco Demayo event, a Mexican American student walked around campus with a flag of Mexico and other students flew a makeshift American States flag or United States flag in response and chanted at the flag bearing students. Students on both sides complained about the incident. A year later, several students came to school on Cinco Demayo wearing American flag shirts and school officials told the students to remove the American flag shirts, or turn the shirts inside out. The educator said the American flag shirts could send a message that would offend the Cinco Demayo celebrants and they had public safety concerns. So what ended up happening was there was essentially standoffs between Cinco Demayo, celebrants and kids aggressively wearing American flag apparel at them on Cinco Demayo.

Jordan  18:42
Why can't people just have nice stuff? Why can't you just why can't you just be cool? Why can't you just allow people to why can't you just be cool one day? Yeah, why can't you just like you can eat like, even then, like, Look, I get it. You're a white nationalist motherfucker in high school and high school, which look, you're probably going to grow out of it. Hopefully, hopefully. It's time to pray. Hopefully, you'll grow out of it. But even if you're a white nationalist, just like take a day off, man. Yeah, just be like, hey, but you guys have your thing. The problem I'm gonna try and oppress you 364 days of the year, but I'm gonna give you this one.

Dan  19:22
The problem with that philosophy though, is that Cinco Demayo was war day because it's even more on for them. It's like I have to I have to be even more American on this day against your presumably anti American Mexican flag. Why

Jordan  19:38
do we even have people? I don't know. Can't we just not do that? It's

Dan  19:42
insane. Are we?

Jordan  19:43
We have too many.

Dan  19:44
So anyway, the the the court ruled essentially that the school was allowed to say no American flag apparel on Cinco Demayo.

Jordan  19:54
Do you mean it had nothing to do with the actual American flag apparel and everything to do with whether or not the school is allowed to say

Dan  20:00
yes. And the reason was for the protection of both the Cinco Demayo celebrating students and the kids wearing the American flag stuff, right? Because it was it was a situation where they deemed like, okay, there were fights that broke out, there was conflict. Let's just not allow people to have this fight. Right. You're in a school.

Jordan  20:25
Now, as far as as far as the conversation over and this is this is exactly what the the Muslim ban thing happened there. The reason that they issued that stay on whether or not they could reinstate it immediately, is not because they agree or disagree with what was going on? It is not because they say there's a you can't do this or that. It's because he did it wrong. It's because the executive order was written in such a way that it's impossible to take it any other way. As a religious situation. Sure. So if he had written it, much more, like if he had taken his fucking time on it, like my, my constant thought about about Trump, is whether or not you agree with what he's trying to do. He's bad at doing it. He's

Dan  21:17
got it follow through. Yeah.

Jordan  21:18
He's like if Obama was like, Obama, if he was going to instigate a Muslim ban, right. And he wouldn't do that, because he's a secret Muslim. Sure. He wouldn't do that. But imagine he he did. He would spend months on it, he would have his lawyers go through word by word. And we take this through the court system, because I don't want to waste everybody's time and money on sending it through the court system and spending all of this time going. Yes, you can. No, you can't. And yes, you can really galvanize the opposite. Yeah, he would try really hard to actually make it work because of competency. Yes. Trump has no issue with that. Yeah, it seemed like they wrote like, hey, no Muslims on a page, and he signed on might as

Dan  22:00
well, but it might have been that Trump rights meme, it might as well have been that like, that sort of thing. Yeah. But then also, the other thing in that ruling was that non citizens have standing and due process rights, which is very important, but I think it's something that we all believed already when I

Jordan  22:17
No, definitely not already. I well, but the root of that is most of us believe people are people.

Dan  22:25
Yeah. And one like,

Jordan  22:27
like the declaration of goddamn independence doesn't say, we believe you know, folks, are you or not we believe American citizens. You know, all men, all men are all men are created equal in the eyes of God, not women. That is a problem. Well, they should have added that, sure.

Dan  22:46
But the but it also, it also like very clearly stipulates that rights aren't given by the government, they're given by our Creator, right, which I also have problems with, but whatever. But it's like a, you know, like your Creator, as you understand. Yes, exactly.

Jordan  22:59
Which, again, that's kind of the whole point of America is that we can't have a state religion.

Dan  23:03
Sure. But human beings have rights because of just being humans, not because the state gave them rights. Therefore, to my understanding, and my belief, if you are someone who isn't a citizen, we still can't treat you like shit. Yeah, you're a person. Yeah. Your rights are granted by God, not by America. Well, just because, you know, confines doesn't mean shit. Yeah.

Jordan  23:27
And well, the greatest point, the greatest point is that always is always that a government cannot give you rights. They can only take them away. Right, right. Right. Right. That's always that's always the starting point. For any

Dan  23:38
years ago, Alex would have agreed with you very seriously.

Jordan  23:42
Well, he also would have been concerned about Putin 10 years ago,

Dan  23:45
two things. I posted a couple of articles on our Twitter, on the knowledge fight Twitter. One was an article about Alex Jones, his former editor Ken Nimmo, who came out and called him a sell out. And if you if anyone knows how to get in touch with him, tell him to hit us up because I'd love to talk to him. Yeah. Second thing. Do you remember back when Alex was talking about how there was going to be a concentration camps in the airports? No, that was 17 years ago. He gave a report from the road. And he was talking about how there was a tape that was going to come out of Trump saying the N word on The Apprentice.

Jordan  24:26
Yes. Yeah, that weird ass report that he gave on the road where he was maybe drunk.

Dan  24:30
Yeah. On A Plane. Yeah, I did a little digging. I found a story about this guy named Marcus moot. We're a 27 year old marketing professional from Glasgow, who found out that Paul Joseph Watson, the editor of prison planet, Donnie J Dubs, he hates straight up. He found out that guys DMS were open. And so he just sent him that story. Oh,

Jordan  24:57
he just started making shit up and throw it at his face. You That's right. Yeah. Infowars is publishing fake news

Dan  25:03
as a prank. He just sent him all this bullshit and then went to bed woke up the next day. And it was on their site, quoting him verbatim what a great day for on our Twitter, I posted a link to this story. And you can see their screenshots of him interacting with PJ Dubs. And it's insane. It's so fucking awesome. It's just legit, you're busted. You fell for it. And I looked into it. I looked to try to find that story. It has now been taken down from infowars.com

Jordan  25:36
At least they did that because half the time they don't even fucking bother. Well, they took down all that like Fox News. Fox News still had Fox News still had that it was a it was a Muslim dude who shot up the the mosque in Canada Alex for like 24 hours.

Dan  25:51
Alex has said that within the last three days? Of course he

Jordan  25:55
did. Because why tell the truth. Lazy.

Dan  26:00
So anyway, lays a tour. Next clip. This is Alex talking about how fucking awesome Andrew Jackson is.

Alex Jones  26:08
When I say this, this is not rhetoric. Okay, this is what's happening in US history. Everybody is probably even more interesting than George Washington. Agreed.

Jordan  26:21
I 100% agree on

Alex Jones  26:23
the man lived in. He did some brutal things. But if you want to draw a line and wipe away the trail, somebody did the things that Jackson did and you'd say That's ridiculous. That's impossible. It's like the Revenant they'll see the Revenant that's historically very very accurate an amazing film by an amazing Mexican director. Point is Andrew Jackson live things like that movie hundreds of times

Dan  26:50
he fought hundreds of bears

Jordan  26:53
Okay, so So you're

Dan  26:56
in his Hugh Glass that's that's yes that's a it's an actual Yeah, that's another person. Yeah, so he didn't live stuff like that. Now another guy you

Jordan  27:04
guys live that Yeah. In specific Yeah. Now I will I'm gonna disclose this as a stand up comedian. I actually do material about Andrew Jackson got a bit he I have

Dan  27:15
a bit would you like to workshop this bit on our audience? No, it's

Jordan  27:19
it's a it's done. It's a good bit. I do it a lot. I'm not gonna waste. I'm not gonna waste a bit on this might have some notes on this. I don't need your fucking notes come to a show you left. Or tonight? I don't I get I get paid either

Dan  27:33
way. This is a public service. And so Jordan Holmes is a very funny comedian. You should go see him.

Jordan  27:39
Sure. So, so I will, I will point out my conflict of interest. About Andrew Jackson, lionizing Andrew Jackson. Fair enough. But I will say this. Andrew Jackson is one of the most interesting American presidents in history, right bad people. Not because he was a good president. He was very, very bad at being president. Also, this

Dan  28:02
clip goes on a lot longer where Alex actually gets into the specifics. Do you want me to you want to listen to this before you rebut?

Jordan  28:07
i Okay. I will tell you, I will tell my favorite Andrew Jackson story and I guarantee get into guarantee that he will not get into it. He might I guarantee you won't. All right. Okay. Here's how I feel. If he does. Just ahead of time I get I will shut up. I will turn my mic off. Okay, I'll give you $1 When Andrew Jackson moved into the White House, he had a party that lasted multiple weeks. Yeah, people were jumping out of windows, many broken windows. But the best part, there was a wheel of cheese. Yeah, the size of a man I know about the story with the end, it just sat out on the White House lawn forever in DC for ever, for

Dan  28:56
weeks, like essentially his entire presidency. So

Jordan  28:58
yeah. And that is the that is the quintessential Andrew Jackson story.

Dan  29:03
You're correct. He does not get into that

Alex Jones  29:05
and survive when nobody else did. He was completely charmed. He had luck that no one could even deal with. When he was down there as a colonel battling the British in New Orleans. They had ships only a few 100 yards away with hundreds of men shooting at him and cannons for over a day. And he had to stand up on this big makeshift blockade they put on the road and they couldn't kill him. They were shooting people all around him and he stood there in a big black fur coat. Just staring at him with his eyes and the night it was like a specter completely broke there will nobody talks about Jackson, no blue remain about him. But notice, in the White House, there is a bust of Jackson on a horse and then there's a big painting right behind Trump of Andrew Jackson. He's the guy that killed the early Federal Reserve they had then He's the guy that survived more than the Native Americans. I mean, it's so crazy the stuff Andrew Jackson did it'll make your head spin. It will.

Jordan  30:08
Yeah, completing a genocide is one of those things and completed a really tried hard. He went for it. It wasn't for lack of trying. Yeah, the Trail of Tears. That's one of the reasons one of the reasons he's clearly lionizing Andrew Jackson right now, is because he was one of the last presidents who literally go up to the Supreme Court and say, I'm going to do it anyway. Yeah, fuck you. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, he was the last he well, he wasn't the last president. But he was one of the main presidents who tried to break the whole checks and balances system, he tried to become king.

Dan  30:42
Well, if you believe in this narrative of the Elders of Zion and the Illuminati and the Federal banks, this sort of, if you believe all of that, there is something to be set for Andrew Jackson, because he did try and stop a Federal Reserve.

Jordan  30:57
He tried to stop everything, which it is, it is like, okay. It's pointed out frequently, that Andrew Jackson tried to bring us back to the gold standard. And yet he is on the $20. Bill. Not anymore. He did, right. We're getting close on there. We're getting close to that. We're not there yet. But he is still on the the $20. Bill. So it's pointed out that it is ironic that he hated paper money so much and yet wound up on it fiat currency. Do you think that is purposeful shade? No, you don't think so? No. How could it not be though? I don't know what, what person working in the treasury was like? Let's put Andrew Jackson on as a memorial. Without knowing any history of Andrew Jackson, just somebody completely ignorant of Andrew Jackson knowledge.

Dan  31:52
Maybe they knew only the stuff that Alex Jones knows the stuff about him, bailing him standing up on top of a ship and menacing people. And

Jordan  32:01
look, he was a menacing ass dude, all

Dan  32:04
these duels, he won all of his duels, which were mostly about how his wife was a whore. He

Jordan  32:10
beat a man to death almost he almost killed a man

Dan  32:13
of John King. He.

Jordan  32:16
I have always thinking well, they have very similar hair.

Dan  32:20
Alright, so this clip goes on a little bit. He says something at the end of this, that's buckwild.

Alex Jones  32:26
I'm gonna say George Washington's life was charmed, and unbelievable as well. But drew, I gotta tell you, he's easily easily dwarfed by Andrew Jackson with the sheer magic providence. Okay, and also toughness, like, he'd get stabbed in duels shot in duels bleed for three days, blood everywhere, through his organs wouldn't die would refuse to die. It was crazy. By the time he was an old man. He would just like drink big containers of like arsenic and lead just to get up in the morning. I mean, that's what they did back then he was wild.

Dan  33:04
He was wild. He was wild. But now this clip takes a turn into the most fun direction of oh, wait, no, sorry. That's an excellent,

Jordan  33:11
that's the next step as far as as far as I

Alex Jones  33:15
really should do a profile on and drew Jackson because he was something else. And the fact that Trump's done his research and is modeling himself after Andrew Jackson sons horror, not good into the guts and spines of the enemy. Good

Jordan  33:34
for good reason.

Dan  33:37
He also says that like Washington was the first he born he gave birth to the Republic. And then Andrew Jackson was the second father of the Republic. Trump is going to be the third.

Jordan  33:49
All right, that's, that's, that's I'm picking and choosing right, though. Boy. Although I will say the Muslim man is the closest corollary to the Trail of Tears that we have right now. Probably. Yeah, I would. I would actually. Yeah,

Dan  34:02
his analogy is not

Jordan  34:03
snow. It's not off at the problem is he's choosing one of the worst American presidents in history as the shining light of America, just because

Dan  34:13
that singular point that he tried to stop the Federal Reserve. Yeah, that's the only thing that's really important. Because he does buy into the Elders of Zion narrative. He does buy into this idea of these crypto bankers who are just trying to manipulate everything and destroy us, which turned us into slaves. Not

Jordan  34:32
too far wrong. That's the problem with bankers, you know, they are evil, you know, it's just not race based. Yeah.

Dan  34:40
Today, we need to talk about what's on our plate. And what's on our plate. Is more

Jordan  34:45
Andrew Jackson. No, although it's close,

Dan  34:48
weird ideas about the Civil War.

Jordan  34:51
Oh boy.

Alex Jones  34:53
British intelligence tried to get the south to secede, just like they did a few decades later. tried to break the country up. Jackson knew about it as president It killed the plan because he was a southerner. Wait, well, I wish they would have listened to him. Of course.

Dan  35:06
Wait, what? Wait what? Why are you confused?

Jordan  35:09
Wait what what?

Dan  35:11
What what you can do is about

Jordan  35:13
Okay, continue the clip.

Dan  35:14
There's all checks out

Alex Jones  35:16
protege Sam Houston, president of Texas and then the governor of Texas for the Civil War was about to start. Shed This is a British intelligence setup do not do this. We it's meant to destroy us all. And of course, he was removed from office and ceremonially by all the young snot noses that knew everything and shut up so those goddamn snow modeling himself after Andrew Jackson who covertly sent in basically the special ops of the day to shut up Texas when he was still president. way what? It's amazing. See, see I'm already going into a history lesson about Andrew Jackson Excuse me.

Dan  35:54
So now

Jordan  35:55
I like I like how covertly is more like he overtly sent an army. Right, right, right. He didn't. Covertly it wasn't. It wasn't like three or four guys like sidled up to Mexico were like, Hey, you want to give us Texas? How about that? Hey, I got an idea. Yeah, I like that. Texas. A Texas. No, it was more like, Hey, how about we take Mexico to Peru? Andrew Jackson is the closest president we have to Yosemite Sam.

Dan  36:24
Yeah. But then that I'm going to do a history lesson about Andrew Jackson being

Jordan  36:30
It'd be terrible. Not a fan. Yeah.

Dan  36:33
But then here, I don't

Jordan  36:35
want to bore you with all of the no more stuff I know about I accidentally

Dan  36:39
stopped the last clip to introduce this. But it was the wrong clip. But we're in the right now. We're

Jordan  36:44
in the right clip.

Dan  36:44
This is the biggest pile of bullshit acting I've ever seen in my life. Okay, and just enjoy it. Does

Jordan  36:51
he do an Andrew Jackson voice? No, but he does because I don't know how you would do that. No,

Dan  36:55
it's over. The Andrew Jackson part is over, but he does space work. Ooh, it's like bad improv.

Alex Jones  37:04
Just just right now in the big news here. For you, I have some phone calls coming in that I just cannot ignore. Yes, hello. Hey. Hey, good. Listen, I'm on the AirMap call you back. Okay. Ignore those calls out of DC in New York.

Jordan  37:27
Now, fuck you. Fuck you. Fuck you. With all

Dan  37:35
what's great is that the angle of that was his mom. That was his mom. No. car wasn't even there wasn't even a call the angle of his phone on the video. You can see that his screen is still black. Like there's no there's no indication that a call is coming in. And like he just like puts it up to his ear. Like it's improv space.

Jordan  37:55
So it's it's actually his cell phone. Yes.

Dan  37:58
It's an iPhone. Wait,

Jordan  37:59
he has his phone on set. Yeah. He is. He is doing a radio show. And he has he has his phone on the set right now.

Dan  38:08
It's sort of you know how like Stephen Colbert or Jon Stewart would have food under the table that they'd use as a prop. Yeah, it's like that. He has his phone that he just grabs and he's actually saying like, I'll call you back but after he has taken the phone away it's like there's there's no way you're not you're not on a call. This is planned. So wait, it's just so plain. What was the plan? The plan is to make it look like he has insider sources calling him

Jordan  38:34
Oh, so he wasn't that was that was just really bad. That was just lying. Yeah, that was that was a bit who would have been on the other end of that call if it was a DC or New York Jerome Corsi. Maybe so so somebody's on the other end of that call? Yeah, they have no idea one that he does this show at the same time? Every goddamn day.

Dan  38:56
Let's also consider that he doesn't have their number saved. It's just a call out of New York racy

Jordan  39:03
also, they're calling him not texting him.

Dan  39:05
Yeah. All right. What bullshit that is amazing. Serious bullshit. Yeah, yeah, absolutely.

Jordan  39:12
He might as well have said that his girlfriend from Canada calling and you wouldn't know her.

Dan  39:16
No. Yeah.

Jordan  39:17
She's She's a model. No big deal. Really cool. Super cool. She's

Dan  39:21
like down to earth.

Jordan  39:22
We love talking. We just talk she loves books. Oh, yeah. You guys ever read books?

Dan  39:28
All right, Jordan. This next clip? Yes. Boy, you're not you know how Alex likes to do media criticism.

Jordan  39:35
I love it when he does media criticism next clip is another example of I assume the only thing he criticizes is always going to be transformers and Cookie Monster. Correct.

Dan  39:44
I wish I wish this is a this is a clip from CNN about how Putin is involved in the like Marie Le Pen's situation over Yes. Isn't that crazy? It is pretty crazy.

Jordan  39:57
It's pretty crazy. Alex then sure. Seems like he's trying to infiltrate every member of NATO and influence the outcome in order.

Dan  40:04
nationalistic.

Jordan  40:05
Isn't that crazy? It is crazy. Yeah.

Dan  40:07
But Alex thinks that's a bunch of pompous Bumpus. And he hates that. And this is his critique of a CNN clip about that very story

Jordan  40:19
of the British intelligence in the Civil War. Are we not going to deal with that at all?

Dan  40:25
No. Okay, well, oh, no, of course not. No, of course. So

Jordan  40:30
he just threw that in and then we're gonna bail on. Okay, immediately. We're gonna throw that away. So

Dan  40:35
the war was planned by the British Dirt. Dirt under no lot. It's so fucking obvious. And we forgot that in that other clip. He also said, my whole family fought on the side of the South.

Jordan  40:51
Yeah, yeah. That's, that's like, oh, that's the exact same thing as people going like the Civil War was fought over states rights. Sure, sure, man. Don't be an asshole. I think he might get it as fought over owning people. Fuck you.

Dan  41:04
I think he might get back to this in a later clip. But so this is this analysis of a CNN clip. That is just fucking Alex style, using similar

Alex Jones  41:14
tactics to how they targeted Hillary Clinton's campaign in person show. So number one, they never prove Russia hacked anything here. They called them being on Russian TV supporting Trump some that that was the influence. What about the Saudi Arabians? What about the Communist Chinese? What about the EU? What about Hollywood? What about the whole power structure in Katy Perry and against Trump? What entertainers? Comparing the poor? What about left shark? What about bossy? No, no, it's the Russians. So now, if anything ever comes out corrupt about officials here in America or in Russia, or anywhere else, the Russians did it. If corruption comes out in Japan or Mexico, the Russians did it. If your wife catches you cheating on her the Russians did it. You know that? Brady and and others didn't win the Super Bowl Sunday, you know that there's a meme out there that the Russians did it? No. And it's white supremacy. I'm not joking. It's white supremacy because there were a few white players. Why New England Patriots? And that's not right.

Dan  42:13
So he just literally said I'm not joking. So he must mean it. Yeah,

Jordan  42:17
he clearly means that batshit crazy shit. He said no one.

Dan  42:20
No one means that no one says that. Legitimately.

Jordan  42:25
No, I think everybody means well. There's a meme going around. You know how memes are always 100%? Serious? Absolutely reflect. I can't remember any meme I've ever seen. That was a joke. Yeah. Now he's not joking. No. So we know that memes are joking. And this goes back to when we know that the British influence the Russian Civil War. Wait, what?

Dan  42:45
Yep. All right. This goes back to him on Rogen being like not understanding that people are joking when they say he's Bill Hicks. Yeah, him not understanding that people are fucking around. If anybody says that the Russians caused the patriots to win the Super Bowl. They're not really saying

Jordan  43:03
that you always but you always have to be under attack. That's why the right wing is never funny. Yeah, because they always have to be under attack. So you can never go far enough to like they don't understand the absurdity of that where it's like, yeah, we know the Russians we know did one thing. So the dirty if it's if it's one thing that they did, which the dirty dossier is now being corroborated? Like it's all over the place. Our government committed all kinds of treason and we're still just fine with it. At least Flynn at least flesh should

Dan  43:37
be in a fucking should feel

Jordan  43:39
a hunger. Yeah. That's the real thing. Nobody's committed treason for so long. He's gonna be hung in public

Dan  43:46
at best. At best. He violated the Logan Act. Yeah, at worst. You should be hung on the streets. Yeah, but absolutely. The dirty dossier. Yeah, it's all p stuff. But

Jordan  43:58
that's the thing. That's the thing. It's like, you can't go too far, you know. So with the left, the idea is always good. Not even the left just with fucking funny people. It's always going to be this is silly. How this is real. Yeah. So let's go and put it in different situations. Let's find an analogue. Yeah. And it's even sillier there. Yeah. But if you're the right wing, it always has to be attack. Well, otherwise, it's not. It's, then it becomes silly, but you realize it's silly all the

Dan  44:28
time. I think that what you're also getting too is that the right wing and the right side of things, kind of isn't able or not not able to, they seem unwilling to engage in abstract thinking. Yeah, it's all concrete. It's all like, these memes say that Russia is part of the Super Bowl. That must they must be seeing the end,

Jordan  44:48
as we all know, only the Sith deals in absolutes.

Dan  44:53
Oh, oh, I did not know that. Yes, this is News. I

Jordan  44:57
do know that. Well, it's fake news. It was in Star Wars.

Dan  45:00
The fake news.com So this we haven't even gotten to the media criticism part. This is fucking bananas once Alex gets to it. All right. Let's get into you know, remember how he started to fucking flex on that Brian stole do I know why this gets worse? Oh,

Alex Jones  45:17
can we pull up some of those memes maybe were they just just just typing memes Russians made the Patriots win, folks, the Russians didn't make the Patriots win, we don't float. The Russians didn't attack Korea, Bush isn't still in office. These are all real things that current members of Congress believe.

Dan  45:37
Again he does not realize that it's slips of tongue. Yep. And not really saying that someone is invading Korea she meant Crimea,

Jordan  45:46
right? Whatever, which is not it's not a it's an easy slip of the tongue. It is. And let's, let's imagine you are shit faced on somebody's podcast. Sure. Right and maybe you let loose that you believe in 12 dimension. Sure, you wouldn't want that to be held against you know, like, you wouldn't want somebody to take that clip and then put it onto a show and talk endlessly about it. That would be offensive to you right?

Dan  46:13
I think that's pretty different. It's very different. But also I want to say that if you're evidence that Democrats are insane, are one slip of the tongue in terms of Nancy Pelosi saying that bush is in office when she met Trump obviously Yep. And then the other Crimea Korea, which sound very similar lapses Yeah, if that's your point, and you want to play those clips for a week? You got nothing? Well, you have nothing

Jordan  46:43
it's like the Jay Leno like man on the street interviews where he cherry picks the silliest

Dan  46:49
will knows that that's you because he has a man on the street named Mark Dice Oh, and he goes out there

Jordan  46:57
dice wire his name's always the bat there's such good there's so good. Like if the UN they've had people with names like his we wouldn't wind up with evil sounding shit like agenda 21 It's the properly wiped out with dirty dossier.

Dan  47:10
It's a propaganda version of porn names.

Dan  47:12
Yeah, like that is yes. Yes. Rob do 100% Yeah, LeAnn

Dan  47:18
McAdoo. Yes. Mark Dice.

Jordan  47:21
fuckface McGee,

Dan  47:22
John Rapoport is still fine. The Papa is in the last name is fun.

Jordan  47:27
David Bork big dick night. Yeah, that's what he's known on the streets has to be known on the street.

Dan  47:33
We gotta get back.

Jordan  47:34
Okay. All right. All right.

Alex Jones  47:36
What type of drugs? Are they on? We don't know. What's wrong with Nancy Pelosi. She looks like an ostrich on PCP. Maxine Harris, she looks like she's on another planet. But the Russians did it. The Russians did it. Let's let's finish up the oh my gosh, the French might want sovereignty, the French might not want to be part of the unelected EU, they never voted to be part of the Russians pulled out of globalism as well, at 19 years ago. So the only truth that the Russians did it is the Russians started doing it first, after they enjoyed 85 years of New World Order social engineering robber baron proto globalism.

Dan  48:17
We got to interrupt this way more than way.

Jordan  48:19
Wait, what? The only evidence that the Russians did it is that the Russians did it first.

Dan  48:25
He's talking about that, right? It's talking about again, the kicking out of the oligarchs, that whole narrative. Yes, he's talking about that 18 years ago, that is them kicking out globalism. Right. And so they're on the vanguard of this new nationalism movement.

Jordan  48:40
That's going out globalism,

Dan  48:42
right with Marine LePen, the Brexit, the apparently the Italians are trying to get out of the EU, right? Things like that are all like, oh, yeah, this is this is us just realizing our sovereignty and getting out of unelected international law,

Jordan  48:58
except it's all elected.

Dan  49:01
Maybe.

Jordan  49:03
I mean, you don't get to join the EU, if you're elected government doesn't say like, Yeah, let's join the EU. It's a complicated process. It is a complicated process. It takes a long time. Yeah. But but maybe you don't just jump in.

Dan  49:15
Maybe what he's saying is that when the EU started, okay, they were grandfathered in, because we needed a founding team. And so like France got in on the ground floor.

Jordan  49:25
I mean, they did need a team that should stop going to war with each other for 1000s of years. That was a really good team to get Sure. That was a smart team.

Dan  49:34
That's a better team than the one that's fighting each other all the time. Yeah, right. Sure.

Jordan  49:37
That team is a bad team, like by the definition of the word team.

Dan  49:41
Yeah. I'm not here to say that the EU is the perfect system for the world. I'm not I'm not here to say that UN is perfect. We're but I am I am saying that some sort of international. You working together is an incredibly positive thing. Yeah. And the reason that it's done is be Because of atrocities that have happened in the past, and

Jordan  50:03
all of the trust and hoping that so many atrocity and working

Dan  50:07
fucking hopefully, that they won't happen again. That's the reason that international bodies exist. Yeah. And,

Jordan  50:17
and the rise of nationalism suggests more than it's like a it's like a pendulum it seems like people want atrocities to happen.

Dan  50:25
Well, the last time and you know, the UN was created after World War Two. Yeah. And that was the EU. And that was really the last time that nationalism had a really aggressive flare up,

Jordan  50:38
right. So it was long enough ago that we actually forgot the ramifications of that type of thinking,

Dan  50:44
or we pretend that what happened there was fake news, fake news, you know, we pretend that the Holocaust was fake news, which some people do.

Jordan  50:53
How Why are people so bad at being people? I don't know. You ever wonder what would happen if people were not

Dan  51:00
bad at that? I don't know. Maybe have a utopia? How do

Jordan  51:03
you deny the Holocaust? Well, actually, I've I've, I've done a bit of denied the Holocaust in the past. Actually, I've done a little bit of Holocaust denying in the past. I've had, I've had a good weekend or two. I went out into the forest and I denied the Holocaust.

Dan  51:18
I've done some research into Holocaust deniers. And most of them don't deny that the Holocaust happened. But they deny the circumstances of it. They believe that there weren't gas chambers and mass killings of Jews. They also believe that the 6 million number is off. Okay, because it was published beforehand. Before the Holocaust, people predicted that 6 million Jews would be killed. Okay. And then 6 million is now the number. Oh, is that too much of a coincidence? That's crazy.

Jordan  51:52
Okay, but then.

Dan  51:55
Hold on. All right. There are other arguments that they make is that they weren't death camps. They were work camps. And then there was tons of aggressive bombing campaigns throughout Germany, and supply chains got cut off, and they didn't have medication and food. So a lot of people who were at slave camps ended up dying. They weren't mass killed. They just died because of circumstance. I'm not sure that makes it better. No, but no, but those are some arguments

Jordan  52:26
instead of instead of being put into an oven your work today?

Dan  52:29
Yeah, those are some arguments that are made by Holocaust deniers that aren't like this. It didn't happen. Right? It happened differently. Right?

Jordan  52:36
It always it always comes back to that as long as you are only looking for information that supports the already crazy thing you think of? You will continue to believe that stuff. Yeah. So any information that doesn't support that you just reject out? Of course, yeah. Because you can always look for more information that supports your dumbshit.

Dan  52:55
Yeah, but there's also a great episode of Montel Holocaust deniers weekly. Montel had a great episode about Holocaust denial. Yeah, it's crazy. You can find it on YouTube. It's really great. Montel. Yeah, it's really interesting. He's at the vanguard of defeating his i Seven his daytime show used to be fucking hot fire. No shit. Yeah, he was straight up interesting conversations. He has this daytime show. He has two Holocaust deniers on there. And two survivors. Uh huh. And

Jordan  53:29
that's fucking crazy. It's what What? What? What's crazier is the survivors just beat the deniers to death.

Dan  53:36
What's crazier is it's a civil sort of discussion about stuff. And the audience asking questions is not it's not like a raucous, everyone's mad at each other. It's perspectives being laid out and it's amazing. Montel we need him right now. I never,

Jordan  53:58
never before uttered on this planet that we need. Montel right? That kind

Dan  54:03
of show is amazing. The idea that you can have people who deny a holocaust, we will have firsthand experience on a show together and it doesn't turn into a fight. It's amazing. I highly recommend you watch it.

Jordan  54:14
I although I bet the Jerry Springer version of that would have gotten way higher ratings absolutely

Dan  54:19
way higher. It's terrible ratings. CNN. Anyway, we

Jordan  54:24
fake news fake news.

Dan  54:25
We gotta get to this clip. Yes.

Alex Jones  54:27
And thank God they've partly struggled free from it. Or they're still big globalist combines in Russia still technically background take control the US? Absolutely. Just like there's globalist tentacles inside the State Department trying to defeat LePen I mean, look at this guy. The French brace for possible election cyber attacks from Russia, about the French brace under EU and Islamic invasion. And a bunch of fifth column collaborators shelling out their country where it's so dangerous. I was reading their tourism's down by like 80%. The last three years. It's a hellhole. Well, Islamic Jihad people running around and like mutated and mixed into the whole gangster culture. It's a joke. Let's go back to the ridiculous piece.

Unknown Speaker  55:14
Several accounts of many of these have many of the leading politicians.

Alex Jones  55:22
We basically wear costumes, and they assume themselves and they dress weird.

Dan  55:30
This is what the trendies do. God, I love him. So the video he is playing is the CNN thing where there's this guy and I got his title here. He is a cybersecurity expert from Columbia University. Yes, and he has a mustache and

Jordan  55:46
Lil Oh, no, he has like a little Johnny Depp

Dan  55:50
going on. He has insane facial hair but doesn't look terrible. It looks I mean, it's fine. A it looks like a musketeer. It's not comical, but Alex has to fucking latch on to this right. And he's like, this is what the trendies do because so

Jordan  56:04
long as you have a weird appearance, none of your opinions matter. Yeah.

Dan  56:09
Now, enjoy the rest of this, which is just LM masting of his facial hair. Wonderful.

Alex Jones  56:17
And they want to look strange. I mean, this guy looks like what cartoon character does he look like? Like the character that should monopoly?

Dan  56:25
He's trying to come up with Snidely Whiplash. Yes, he never does. But the guy who's behind the scenes comes up with snidely and puts him up on there. Okay, what's up on the video but

Jordan  56:37
Alex, but Alex never remembers the name never gets there. He didn't go with Pepe Le Pew then do that either. All right,

Alex Jones  56:43
or that the staff believes he's wearing a black top hat Mephistopheles, he needs a monocle or, or is he in the German High Command? But this is what trendies do they go how do we convince them? They don't trust us anymore. We've cried info babes rollout trendies info to sound real pseudo intellectual period. Don't interrupt him rewind it. Everything that's gonna interrupt him. Yeah. So So again, I bet we don't and Russians are the reason the Patriots won, and white supremacy.

Dan  57:12
Which again, is not what this guy is. Nobody believes that. Anyway, zero people believe that.

Alex Jones  57:17
There's like homophobe, white supremacist Russian agent. And you could mix it. Russian agent homophobe. Okay, you can you can interchange those. But always though the same things in different orders. This is the great intellectual gravitas we're dealing with shows up so let's go back to a guy in a costume. Okay, here here. He has

Nancy Pelosi  57:37
personal accounts of many of these, many of the leading politicians and also that have their spouses, their friends, their lovers. I would think all of those would be very rich targets for people that were brought up the KGB

Alex Jones  57:51
boss. Let's rewind it again. Definitely didn't interrupt him.

Alex Jones  57:55
This is what the CIA foppish effeminate, weak little nobodies that want to just get off on the secrecy and being able to break into your files and you know be over here in the new Uber overclass.

Dan  58:08
Again, this uber

Jordan  58:10
Ober is not a word. No, Uber or anyone

Dan  58:12
trying to say Oberlin over he's probably mad at over. Yeah. But also like he. This guy isn't in the CIA.

Jordan  58:20
No, but he has a foppish little. What week? Why is everybody's eat pussy? Why is everybody see?

Dan  58:29
Yeah, he's just so mad at this guy's masculinity.

Jordan  58:32
Yeah, always know always mad at masculinity.

Dan  58:35
Yeah, it gets worse.

Alex Jones  58:38
The Uber mentioned, but then meanwhile, everyone hates him. And so they just roll out these twits the villains out of central casting to act like the Russians are the only people to ever get involved in elections, and that the only ones ever use sex operatives. And again, if anybody breaks in anybody's computers, and there's criminal activity going on, it's not the fault of the criminal, or the pedophiles, you know, to the WikiLeaks. No, no, no, it's the fault of the Russians, even though it's US intelligence that leaked almost all of it, and more is getting ready to come out. So don't worry, my little twit friend.

Jordan  59:12
Well, one US intelligence leaked what the Russians did

Dan  59:16
and the more that's coming out is Flynn being Russia Yeah, really fucked up. He committed treason which he did. We knew that in November. Yeah. In September Yeah. He was on the pay. Well,

Jordan  59:29
we couldn't we couldn't confirm it. He was a paid. Thank God. Thank God. We finally got to the bottom of Hillary Clinton's emails.

Dan  59:37
Thank God. Oh,

Jordan  59:39
I would have been so mad if we didn't get to the bottom of that.

Dan  59:41
Yeah. Anyway, he really is got to fucking get down on this masculinity shit. Okay,

Alex Jones  59:47
a lot more is gonna be coming out. So let's, who is this guy even? I mean, this guy is unbelievable. Look at that outfit. Oh my God. Look at

Dan  1:00:00
fake laugh also first of all his face his fake laugh is worse than click and clack the tappet brothers. On Car Talk

Jordan  1:00:08
on I am more offended by fake laughs than fake news.

Dan  1:00:12
Yeah, me too. Have you ever listened to Car Talk? No. Oh, holy shit.

Jordan  1:00:15
I don't listen to fucking anything.

Dan  1:00:17
It's on NPR. My parents used to make me listen to it. Okay, as a kid, I was even like, they are laughing. They're laughing about mufflers. What are they doing? There? It was. It's so fake. Okay, Alex Jones. His life is worse. Like Top Gear. Yeah, but then the the other thing is he's like, look at this outfit, guys just wearing a suit.

Jordan  1:00:37
Why would you go after a guy's outfit? What is wrong with you real

Dan  1:00:40
talk? He's wearing a suit. That's just a suit. Yeah.

Jordan  1:00:44
Is it a good suit? Yeah, it's fine. Is it like? Is it like one of the what chuck chuck what's his name? They NBA guy?

Dan  1:00:50
I don't know. But his tie is like slightly lightly colored. I don't know. That's the only thing I could think you could it's a pastel. I don't know. But anyway, here we go. Listen to this. Okay.

Alex Jones  1:01:00
The eyes look at the arrogance. That guy thinks he is so smart man. You know women run from Him. This is a loser just oh my god. Let's continue here we go.

Nancy Pelosi  1:01:12
Little accounts of many of these have many of the leading politicians and also that have their spouses, their friends, their lovers. I would think all of those would be very rich targets for people that were brought up in the KGB system positive

Alex Jones  1:01:26
one. I wonder does that guy drop like a white van? fits with the outfit? That I mean, don't you think? No then like, kind of like a onesie? No jumpsuit or something? White around the head? No, whatever. He is lovely animals. He will pets and cages. What? Oh, what were watching what was

Alex Jones  1:01:52
that sound? The people?

Dan  1:01:54
He's like we're watching you.

Jordan  1:01:55
What was that sound?

Dan  1:01:57
That was just weird. vague. Threatening. He was chewing on his pen for a second. Yeah, that was weird. He is just fucking like we know about you guy with facial hair. Okay, so like so there was there was a van. There's a guy wearing

Jordan  1:02:11
a suit. Yeah. And he had facial hair. That was unusual.

Dan  1:02:15
I might post a picture of him on just so everyone can see he's not wearing weird suits.

Jordan  1:02:22
It's very he's not wearing he's not wearing that tax guy from the 90 suit that was filled with question marks. Oh, he's not wearing that one. The Riddler? Yeah. Okay. All right. He's not wearing he's not wearing a onesie at all. No, no,

Dan  1:02:34
he's not a jumpsuit. He just has weird facial hair. And it's not that weird. It's just weird.

Jordan  1:02:39
It's just unusual. Yes. It's unique. Yeah,

Dan  1:02:43
he's a trendy. And clearly he's got a white van got to accuse him of being a pedophile. Okay,

Jordan  1:02:49
how little do you have to do for Alex to accuse you of being a pedophile?

Dan  1:02:54
You have to disagree with him. Yeah. Is

Jordan  1:02:56
that literally it? Yeah, just like Hey, Alex, maybe don't say that. What are you a pedophile? No, boy.

Dan  1:03:04
Joe Rogan's? Lucky he got off. Yeah, I'm

Jordan  1:03:07
surprised Joe Rogan isn't fucking kids right now.

Dan  1:03:10
Surely disagree with him. That's true. So he goes on to yell more about this clip from CNN about how Putin is real cool. Nationalism is awesome. And then I thought he was done making fun of this guy, but he wasn't

Jordan  1:03:25
oh, god dammit. So

Dan  1:03:27
how could you not be here's some more about him.

Alex Jones  1:03:30
And so again, Russia is the big bad guy. Let's go back to Mr. Peanut or whatever. This guy is Mr. Creepy. I mean, let's name this guy. We need to we need a meme out of this guy. Who is this guy? Jason Healy, cybersecurity expert Columbia University. I bet you money. That Mr. Creepy has a great look at that guy. I mean, Mr. creepy looking how smart probably is. I mean, this is a joke. You send your kids to the mental institutions they call public schools and learn at the feet of this guy. Here, here, here here.

Nancy Pelosi  1:04:07
In the disrupted TV, mom's television broadcast. They had the Twitter positive day.

Alex Jones  1:04:13
Arrogance. As he does these little scripted lines. He practices all day, goes in and sits down at CNN with almost no viewers, and then just tries to talk with total confidence. They disrupted the man's with his decision, the headline at Hawk all before we move on to the mouth. Anytime corruption comes out. Don't look at the corruption. It's the Russians and more Russians are on everything. Do you see my little 18th century beard? Let's continue.

Dan  1:04:45
That's insanity. That's so that's so vapid. That's

Jordan  1:04:49
that's you know, you know, I really liked how he engaged with the guys ideas. Yeah. And had a policy walk based discussion about certainly, it was really more about policy, that it was devoid of any conversation about what he said we played 100% about how he was foppish?

Dan  1:05:08
Yeah, we played twice the guy. I don't remember his name, but the cybersecurity expert from Columbia University. Yes. Saying that loved ones family members,

Jordan  1:05:19
which would let's let's be proud of ourselves, because we allow his clips to go just a little bit longer than BLS other people's

Dan  1:05:27
clips to go substantially longer. But like he played, he played it twice. This guy is saying that those sorts of people would be excellent targets for the KGB, they would be Yep.

Dan  1:05:41
If I was in the KGB. Those are the targets I would pick. Yeah, cuz then maybe other targets would be bad ideas, find some dirt, you could find some way to find a dossier dirty one, you can find a dirty dossier. And so

Dan  1:05:54
like, Alex doesn't engage with that at all. He just engages with the mustache, and weird assumptions about how this guy's a fucking pedophile. And it's, it's insane. It's it's it's literally it's the absence of journalism. It's not it's not bad journalism. It's the Yeah, it's journalism in a vacuum. Anyway, let's get to our next clip. Because I have some fucking numbers on this one. I'm excited about this.

Alex Jones  1:06:24
watched, listened, consumed our information. 85,000,050 plus million last week, you had Joe Rogan's podcast, that's now the 40 million. What are they going to do? They're going to try to say we're all Russian thugs. It's amazing.

Dan  1:06:48
It is amazing. I am not going to try and say that he is a Russian per se. But what I am going to say is that it's weird that he said 50 million people took us and if you account wrote, If you count Rogen, it's 40 million. I'm not really sure what that

Jordan  1:07:01
mean. I don't does that mean that Rogan accounts for 40 million of the 50 million or maybe but here if you count Rogen, you remove 10 million from the 50 million negative 10 million negative 10 million if you

Dan  1:07:13
count Rogen, but he said that 50 million people took in his work in the lab or 85,000,050. Last week. Let's break down.

Jordan  1:07:26
Okay, let's

Dan  1:07:26
break it down. All right. I know that he's a global show. I know that everyone can see it all over the world. Okay, well, let's take Russian propagandists, let's let's imagine this just inside the United States. Okay, just to give you an please extrapolate this to the rest of the population of the world, right? The United States

Jordan  1:07:48
300 ish million people.

Dan  1:07:50
If you want to get 50 million people listening to your show, you have to have every single person, every single man, woman and child in the top 52 cities in the United States, that's still only 49 million. To give you some context, that's every city, including Bakersfield, California, and higher. Okay, Bakersfield, California and up so which single man, woman and child now just put his population throughout the world? Yeah, that's how many people don't believe that for a second.

Jordan  1:08:31
In order to get 50 million people or 85 million people listening to your show, you have to be Johnny Carson 50

Dan  1:08:38
years ago. And even then, I don't think that's the case. No. And that was back in the hit three trends. Yeah, the idea of 50 million people is cool. But it's 50 million hits. There are artificial hips that happen of course,

Jordan  1:08:53
and he always talks us up over them Russian. He always talks about

Dan  1:08:56
these, like we have all these plays on Facebook. That's because someone scrolled past the video and it just started playing and they didn't they didn't watch it.

Jordan  1:09:04
Oh, does that count? Yeah, it does. God dammit. Yeah,

Dan  1:09:07
all these things point all these things factor into your statistics, right. And again, Russian troll farms. Yeah. Shit like that.

Jordan  1:09:16
They have troll farms. Yeah,

Dan  1:09:17
you have all these fake numbers that end up happening. And so yeah, I mean, your 50 million number. There's no way for me to prove what the actual number No, of course there's no goddamn way that the entire population of the top 52 cities in America spread out throughout the world if you just take all of those people in the last week engaged with your content. No fucking way.

Jordan  1:09:41
Absolutely not possible because if that's the

Dan  1:09:43
case, you're a fucking rock star.

Jordan  1:09:48
Yeah, he would be he would. You would be a billionaire.

Dan  1:09:51
You know what would happen? He wouldn't be a

Jordan  1:09:53
billionaire. Like with the advertisers.

Dan  1:09:55
The things he said

Jordan  1:09:56
advertisers would be tearing his doors apart. Try trying to get as much onto his show as possible. He has integrity. He has integrity. That's true. He doesn't unless Unless somebody let's say a salesman convinces him otherwise that y2k is real. Yeah, exactly which that he'll believe whatever it is.

Dan  1:10:14
He's told to believe let us let I feel like we need to call ourselves out a tiny bit. Because Okay, in that episode were he was giving that fake bullshit about what happened on y2k? Yes, we did. We were too busy calling out all the other stuff around it that we forgot to call out that in his story.

Dan  1:10:32
He didn't even call out that he's sensationalism wasn't about y2k. That's true. It was not about y2k. No, his entire y2k episode had nothing to do with y2k. Yeah. So we did a bad job. We forgot about the fact that he had Yeah, okay.

Dan  1:10:49
That's the problem. He's a bullshit onion. The

Jordan  1:10:51
years there's so much he's got so much built into it.

Dan  1:10:56
Anyway, let's get to the next narrative. This one is about how Trump is could be doing way more Oh, and the things that he could be doing would be way better.

Jordan  1:11:05
Horrifying. Okay.

Alex Jones  1:11:08
Donald Trump could have them all arrested, just like not good. Lincoln had members of the State Department arrested. Lincoln had judges arrested and hundreds of newspaper editors arrested because they were in open sedition calling for the overthrow of the Republic. Now, did he go too far? Absolutely. Was the north and south played off against each other? Absolutely. In my entire ancestral background fight in the South. You bet they did the point. He did all that 1 million light years more than what Trump's done. And hey, Trump's a big ol Yankee, just like the guy from Illinois was everybody just better get ready because I'm gonna back this Yankee in the attack on our Republic, and the attempt to completely overthrow this country and make no mistake. Those aren't words. I have read 100 history books on Andrew Jackson. I've read probably 15 on

Jordan  1:12:03
20 He has not read 100 books in his life.

Dan  1:12:06
No, but also him struggling to come up with Jefferson. Yeah, me.

Jordan  1:12:11
Yeah. Now, as far as the Lincoln

Dan  1:12:15
are there 100 books about Andrew Jackson. Oh, easily.

Jordan  1:12:18
But Andrew Jackson is so fascinating. writable books? No, well, no, no. No. As far as as far as Lincoln's arresting of judges and journalists. What was published was a fake proclamation that was purportedly signed by Lincoln. Okay, so the, the journalists then publish something that supposedly was said by Lincoln, that was supporting the South. Okay, so it was basically while they were at war, it was fake news. It was it was fake news, but such that it was like sent out to the rest of the world saying, hey, you know, yeah, it was journalists. So all the things that Flynn did, is basically those but your newspaper. Okay. Cool. It was it was legitimate treason, would you?

Dan  1:13:11
Would you believe that Alex Jones has read more books?

Jordan  1:13:16
Let's find out. Your show on.

Alex Jones  1:13:20
Washington, probably six or seven on Lincoln? Probably read 20 books on Civil War, watched all the documentaries on PBS? I mean, I studied it. Are you going to a college with a professor that teaches a civil war and stay on my own with them? I know what I'm talking about. I'm not some pseudo intellectual here. Go. I'm not bragging either. But I've done my homework because it's so interesting is the policy Donald Trump could have the people in the State Department who openly worked with Soros last few years to overthrow countries. They're not trying to do it here. He could have arrest everybody right now. He could send the Marines in right now to put them in irons and drag them before juries and grand juries for sedition that's uncut. We think this edition is working with like the Chinese even though they are working with the globalist or the Russians. Were doing this because they want to shut our speech down claiming it's sedition, when they're the ones involved in open sedition and big news coming. It's our better brains coming soon on who the leakers are in the White House. On Monday, we're gonna report easic Bad day, we're gonna tell you who the leakers are. Who there is a coup at every level against President Trump. That's why he's racing to cut your taxes level racing to stabilize the economy. Racing to trump up the economy. Oh fuck you bubble which he admits is a bubble but one tried to blast off his stuff is melting down. We're trying to get off Krypton here folks is it is going down the proverbial molten drain.

Dan  1:14:56
There's a lot to unpack. That

Jordan  1:14:57
is a lot of words. Yeah, I love his his number of books read is very indicative of what's going on probably about 200. Total 100 on Jackson. Yeah, right. Six on Lincoln. Yeah. 20 on the Civil War. So the so only only six of the books of the Civil War mentioned Lincoln, that could be a Venn diagram situation. That is a bad Venn diagram. No, but

Dan  1:15:22
there might be some overlap. Like all six of those books might have been also the Civil War books.

Jordan  1:15:27
That's what I'm saying. Yeah, so good. No, it's not good. It kind of suggests his focus is on a president who ignored the other checks and balances of the government and killed as Yeah, the Civil War, a British, which his relatives fought on the south, but it was a British saya and who it's a British Saya, and then six on Lincoln. I'm guessing now. Yeah. Call me crazy.

Dan  1:15:55
You're crazy.

Jordan  1:15:56
My thought maybe the six books that he read on Lincoln, were not about how Lincoln was a great American hero.

Dan  1:16:03
They might be the Holocaust denier version of Lincoln books.

Jordan  1:16:08
And there are so many of those possible. I've had a lot of conversations with people who think it was unconstitutional for Lincoln to fight the Civil War. Sure. Now, that's a really interesting question. Not to me, neither to me either. If you really wanted to be a dick about it, though. Yeah, you get into it. Now, admittedly, if you're looking at the situation we're living in now, I would kind of think that we lost the Civil War. Because the Saudis really took over then they did rise again. They rose again. We laughed at them for so long. They rose again. Let's

Dan  1:16:43
let's let's get back to Alex. Here's a collection do crazy. That is a teaser for our next episode. This is a teaser where Alex is going

Jordan  1:16:52
to be on Monday, he's gonna say some bombshell shit.

Dan  1:16:55
No. On our next episode, we are going to deal in detail with what he's about to talk about. Okay? But for now, just just enjoy it. Just enjoy this and imagine what that next episode is gonna be like.

Alex Jones  1:17:10
Rappaport has really found the keys to the kingdom, documenting the actual plan to turn colleges into giant mental illness factories to make you mentally ill jabbering idiots so you don't know you were sold worthless degrees and to prepare you for assimilation into the corporate Borg system and to make sure you hate families, so you automatically self censor and don't have kids. So it's basically a death cult brainwashing, soul sucking system, not attacking you that have degrees. Everybody knows some of the degrees are worthless, or actually our negative value just to pay for the toilet paper. You do and a metaphysical toilet paper she gave and walk around with. I mean, you could rattle more it's kind of a report on that he broke down yesterday that hour. I listened to that hour last night.

Dan  1:17:55
We're gonna start off we'll get to what happens but

Jordan  1:17:58
I listened to that hour last night. Oh, you know, the only thing the shower last night, listen to that hour last night. And I was thinking it's time to get some power last night. It's time to pray. It's the right time to pray on

Dan  1:18:09
this. Also, I'd like to give the world a little bit of insight into me. The only thing I've done with my degree is be qualified for jobs. And I've done cocaine off it.

Jordan  1:18:20
Yeah. i How is it that he gets something so right for the wrong reasons? Yeah, I agree. There are so many worthless degrees. Yeah, you are assimilated into the board machine. Sure. There are plenty of times where it but it's not a death cult? No, but it's not a secret. It's not a monstrous thing.

Dan  1:18:41
This is where we get into Logic. It's just the system that broke down logic is A to B, if A is true, B must be true. Right. That's how logic works. I believe in that it's truth preservation. Yes. So you're saying that degrees are worthless. Therefore, this is a death cult. And that's a problem for

Jordan  1:19:02
us get into trouble. They

Dan  1:19:03
agree with a we don't agree. Because a doesn't lead to be No, that's how logic is supposed to work. Your premises lead to the conclusion. You have to say, degrees are worthless. And then another thing in order to maybe justify the conclusion to the devil, right? And so far, you've done none of that work. Right?

Jordan  1:19:23
So So our problem is that he starts from B Well, then a must be true. That's where we all get into trouble. Oh, he

Dan  1:19:31
starts with B. I love B. Now it's bullshit. But also this one a thing? I bet people will just sign off on be here a

Jordan  1:19:43
stars. Yeah, it starts so good. Yeah, it starts a good ruts. It's

Dan  1:19:47
that logical fallacy of starting from the conclusion, right? It's, it's what people do a lot. You already decide what you want to believe and figure out how to it's yeah, it's backwards engineering, but this clip isn't done. Here's where Alex

Jordan  1:20:02
Man, let's find out. It's so let's do this so weird. What are we going to do? It

Alex Jones  1:20:07
was just his voice and just his his focus and his understanding and his gravitas. Just, you know, John port deserves to be a superstar. I mean, he's popular. He's a great researcher, investigative journalist, but he just is a piece of work. I mean, just

Dan  1:20:25
I do agree he's a piece of work. But my tone is very different when I say

Alex Jones  1:20:33
John Rapoport, and I want to get more board ops more people more more folks run shows and keep working with GCN I'm on competition with GCN I love Ted love GCM but more people I ran for need daily shows. The problem is talk radio is geared to three hour shows you probably couldn't do that. Yeah, it's geared to that. Your doesn't want to do that. But it's just so good.

Dan  1:20:54
That fucking dentry ass bitch could not handle three hours a day. From his weird fucking attic. Listen to our next show, you'll you'll find out exactly why

Jordan  1:21:05
I want to I want to just have a camera on him for three hours a day. Oh, I do not want him to talk into it. I just want to find out what three hours of that dude John reports life is like, yeah, it's gotta be insane. Three. I imagine he just walks back and forth in that room. Is that, uh, oh, yeah. For, you know, 23 hours of every day and that he talks into the fourth hour of the Alex Jones

Dan  1:21:32
get excited for context for what we're talking about in our next episode. Also, I would say three hours of his life he's got a question like, I should hang that painting. At least twice in those three hours. This will all make sense. Next episode.

Alex Jones  1:21:48
He's so informed because when you're really researched like I am you here's mine that's researched as well. Or a policy just so lovingly lay it all out. It's just soothing to be freed from the bondage with me. It's more like a desperate barking dog. I learned the enemy brown in the house but with Rapoport it's just like here. Let's remove that mind control. Let's just take all that away. Take it off. Today about the New World Order and I was listening to him driving to a company meeting last night and driving home and it was that was the whole hour. And I got bed last night with it with a phone when I was listening to I want to sleep Lucinda Rapoport he's Jen no I don't have a crush on Rappaport. Those memes start I love me for the time either so funny. actually encourage people to do it. The point is, is that that's why the meme was fear loves me because we like we like to like to have fun. But Rob ports Awesome. That we'd like to

Jordan  1:22:47
that was that was such a roller coaster ride of. I think he's jerking off to Michael Rapaport or Joe

Dan  1:22:54
either way, the Rapaport

Jordan  1:22:57
I would jerk off to Michael I'm assuming he's a jerking off to John mighty

Dan  1:23:01
Aphrodite is a great movie.

Jordan  1:23:02
Absolutely. Then it's No I'm not gay. I would never be gay. Nobody can be gay. Who's as masculine as I am. I don't have a crush on those memes. i But you know, I encourage me I love I love memes. The memes sphere loves me.

Dan  1:23:17
He said the meme of sphere the meme of sphere.

Jordan  1:23:19
Oh, my favorite, my favorite. I'm gonna call it the Miva sphere from never ever again.

Dan  1:23:26
That that will not take its place in the vernacular. No, thank you. So the next clip, I actually don't know what this clip is. All right, my grab bag in it. I've forgotten but it's good.

Alex Jones  1:23:40
To get involved in our families in the ancient eternal relationship between men and women, how much Father's love their daughters how much mother's love their sons and vice versa. Trying to turn the species itself against each

Jordan  1:23:53
other. Trump loves his daughter to women

Alex Jones  1:23:57
leaving they're in power because they see men falling before them and the system collapsing is happening. And then they're so unhappy because they're married to a state that's there to take all the resources away and only give them a culture of death. Speaking and cultural life. The Surgeon General the American Dental Association get it right when they say a lot of heart attacks are associated with bacteria that get into the bloodstream and create plaques inside the arteries and veins. To the heart is not your first able to have colonists have ads inside an ad or are on the gum line and then get into the bloodstream. That's why it's essential that you go out and get at least in my view, three four cleanings, no cleanings a year. My dad also brush in my view three times a day intensely and floss, but a lot of toothpaste obviously a fluoride or they got a bunch of garbage or a bunch of silicates that tear up your toe. My day. Add ah has developed a lot of products in his time and he developed super blue non fluoride, superglue

Jordan  1:25:09
non fluoride toothpaste

Dan  1:25:10
that fucking

Jordan  1:25:12
was started with the opening of Burberry opening to that clip seemed very you couldn't talk to the opening that clip right?

Dan  1:25:21
How dare the globalists get involved with our family

Jordan  1:25:24
wound Derald and bound up well barreled down to I hate the globalist

Dan  1:25:32
seconds of fuck the globalists, our families are important. And then

Jordan  1:25:36
but let me tell you something. What do you know what people agree on? Bacteria is bad? Yeah, let me give you a toothpaste. My dad invented it.

Dan  1:25:43
I love that smooth fucking transition is like so good at that. And he's coming out of a break. That was a commercial. No,

Jordan  1:25:50
that was a commercial break that he's coming out of Yes. Immediately into a commercial.

Dan  1:25:55
That's why they can sell their shit for free. Yeah, I just do their commercials on the show as though it was part of the show. Yeah, it's insane. It's part of it should be illegal. I don't know. But yeah, yeah. You're just selling stuff during your actual show,

Jordan  1:26:11
or at least you should disclose it. Yeah. Or at least let's say just disclose. Let's say if you're a I don't know, some sort of mouthpiece for the government. Right. And you use your position as a mouthpiece for the government to advertise, let's say, the daughter of the President's clothing line. Yeah, that's probably a crime. Right? Probably. That's super a crime probably. Is that okay?

Dan  1:26:37
I'm not okay with it. No,

Jordan  1:26:39
me neither. Now, if you think somebody will be punished for Kellyanne

Dan  1:26:43
Conway tried to pimp super blue,

Jordan  1:26:47
I would be totally fine with I would be that would be way more fun.

Dan  1:26:51
I'd be blown away.

Jordan  1:26:52
I would I would find that so hilarious.

Dan  1:26:55
This next clip during this next clip, yeah. Might be more unethical.

Jordan  1:26:59
I can't imagine that then

Dan  1:27:01
trying to sell Nordstrom shit. Conway, because Alex legitimately admits that he's just broadcasting classified information. He legitimately says, I don't believe him. But he says that's what he's doing. So

Alex Jones  1:27:22
now, let me tell you what the customs officials really want to do. And this information is classified, but they classify everything. And so I'm just gonna tell you know, I've been aware of this for a decade, that's the link. Google has software, where you can take a picture of somebody and run it on your computer. And it's free software, and it'll find that person. You can also have pitcher match where it's the exact pitcher and they find it really quick and seconds, and where it came from. They hit the border, when these people have fake passports, they don't know who they are. They want to just take their picture, run it against a database of the Internet to pop up that indeed, they're really a jehadi on their own Facebook, because these people are so arrogant. They'll have their own Facebook's showing their terrorist.

Dan  1:28:03
What facial recognition technology does exist. It does.

Jordan  1:28:08
But I don't know if you've known about that. But Google's actually really bad at that. Like they don't do a great job of facial recognition. Now they're trying to make that better. Because yeah, I think that is kind of a goal for them. Yeah. Right. If you weren't, if you were a shadowy secret government agency, you would want to know everybody's faces at all times. As because as we know, we can always trust shadowy secret government agencies to have our best interests in mind. Yeah. But yeah, I don't think I don't think he's known it for 10 years

Dan  1:28:40
and those are what do you think about the idea

Jordan  1:28:44
is fine but I'm gonna share it Isn't that against the law? It's literally illegal isn't that why they have classified material is so you don't share it literally what he just did there is illegal it's illegal if if don't do we have laws anymore? If that are we sure we have laws if that's

Dan  1:29:01
actually classified information? That was a crime. Now, yeah, here, here's your I'll just flip one for you. Okay, this is classified information. Oh, shit. I shouldn't fucking tell you this.

Jordan  1:29:13
Okay, well tell me anyways. Well, tell me on air.

Dan  1:29:18
Listen, the NSA. They think nachos are delicious. Do they? It's classified.

Jordan  1:29:25
No, I'd like as an organization or so if you're I don't want to I don't want you to share that information. If you're just making

Dan  1:29:31
up shit, then it's not really a crime. But if he was just literally spouting some shit,

Jordan  1:29:38
that actually and that does sound like if that was real. It would be classified wouldn't know like you wouldn't want to share PII. You wouldn't want to share that you could recognize anybody's face also, no I don't think so. What border is a jihadi coming from Canada, Canada, Mexico fly get a lot of jihad. He's from Mexico, right all flying in from suit And yeah the the place where oh god we're all gonna die

Dan  1:30:03
all these millions of jihad ease that don't exist in our country all these millions of jihad ease. So this next clip by the

Jordan  1:30:12
way my okay my 80s style team carwash comedy, okay would be called jehadi carwash BHOTT i e, g hottie G Hardy carwash, I like this. That would be pretty great. Right? Yeah. Women headscarves bikinis, their washing cars. It is yeah. Yeah, the whole thing.

Dan  1:30:40
George Soros will fly. I guarantee it. He loves that. Yeah. hotties, either

Jordan  1:30:46
that or that Chinese billionaire who's trying to calm shy, calm strike.

Dan  1:30:53
Fake News. So this next clip, I want to say this. Here's the new segment I want to do on the show, which is look out for this word. Americana, I really think is going to turn into pretty soon it's going to be a buzzword. It's already a buzzword, but it's going to be worse. I think it's okay to be a buzzword for white nationalism, and that sort of thing. It sounds

Jordan  1:31:16
good. It hasn't always kind of been a buzzword for white people doing white people shit,

Dan  1:31:21
right, but I think it's gonna get worse. Okay. And that plays into this clip. And then also remember earlier when he told you that Monday we're gonna get the story on.

Jordan  1:31:32
Are we gonna get to it today? He just goes Oh, guards.

Alex Jones  1:31:37
People keep asking me Alex, how do you predict what Trump's gonna do before he does it? Because I've watched what he does. I've gotten into the mind frame. Plus, we're both Americana. We're all American. We're looking at the same journey. We're driving down the same road together.

Jordan  1:31:48
We're also psychic powers.

Dan  1:31:49
Also, I fucking love the people keep asking me.

Dan  1:31:53
Do you predict No Trump? Who asks him it's the same thing would ask him.

Dan  1:31:58
Have you ever listened to the Paul Stanley album? The lead singer of Kiss?

Jordan  1:32:03
Yeah, I know Paul Stanley is I've never listened to his own album. There's an

Dan  1:32:06
album of just his stage pattern. Oh, that's

Dan  1:32:10
right. I know about that. What people love off my chest. It's like 45 minutes long. No, it's crazy hour and a half. Oh, Jesus Christ,

Dan  1:32:16
Weiss your length. And it's just him doing like, whoa, intros to songs God and he, he constantly says people keep asking me, and I love just the idea of like,

Jordan  1:32:28
no one asked, Who is who is asking. And Alex Jones just did that. He's like, mind if somebody who would want to ask you that people keep

Dan  1:32:37
coming up to me and they say they say Alex and I say what they say Alex? How do you know what Trump was gonna do? As they were just blur all just Americana.

Jordan  1:32:46
We're just both America and he's tapping into the same thing. I'm tapping into man. He's Americana. It's the spirit

Dan  1:32:52
force of America. Yeah.

Alex Jones  1:32:56
Not telling each other what to think or do we're seeing as on its face, prime aphasia. That's why I'm saying very good chance, Reince Priebus within three weeks we'll be gone. Because he's clearly the leaker. He's clearly the one that continues to basically undermine the president and say that you're the president's like a you know, lost child in the White House. All these leaks and Trump's really upset about I know for a fact, I was looking for a new chief of staff. I'm just gonna stop right there. We're gonna have the big story for everybody. So

Dan  1:33:26
you just gave away the story.

Jordan  1:33:27
Yeah. So Monday, they're going to have a big story that is writes Priebus has gone

Dan  1:33:34
you just legit Well, I mean, like, we'll see when this is out. I mean, who knows? But like that that kind of thing is so fucking awesome.

Jordan  1:33:43
But what so it but it doesn't matter. Like literally every day it seems like there's a big story of some crazy shit happening in the White White House. Yeah. So even if it's not writes Priebus is gone. It could be anything and that is a big story.

Dan  1:33:59
Yeah. But not every day does Aleksei I'm not going to tell this story. Just tell the story.

Dan  1:34:06
Actually. I feel like every day he does do that then as he's been like,

Dan  1:34:10
Alright, here's a story Reince Priebus is not long for this earth.

Dan  1:34:15
will tell you the whole story on Monday right? Just did yeah, that's pretty much the whole story. There is nothing left to teach unless unless the story is writes previous dies of polonium poisoning. But that that would be mis that would be pretty funny. That's not Russia.

Dan  1:34:29
I my six trying to make it look like Russia.

Jordan  1:34:32
Right? Well, like how they started the Civil War. Absolutely.

Dan  1:34:36
So the next two clips we got two more clips left to go. These next two clips are so on Friday. Alex does a long string of interviews. Most of the shows interviews will What are so bad.

Jordan  1:34:54
So well are like QUESTION Yeah, are the interview we He's allowed to talk.

Dan  1:35:02
Not much.

Jordan  1:35:03
Okay good or bad. I was worried a bit but not much. I was worried that he would allow other people to speak.

Dan  1:35:07
So there's this guy named Matt Bracken on. And he is a just a weirdo old military guy,

Jordan  1:35:17
Matt bracken.

Dan  1:35:17
He's he's

Jordan  1:35:19
great, great names, great names so great. Everybody has names God Damn,

Dan  1:35:24
he is he's terrible. He's a bigot. And I say that based on his words, not based on anything else. And then also he has another interview with John Rapoport, which again, our next episode, we'll deal with John Rappaport. But then, the his other interview is with Nigel McGuinness, who is the guy who started advice

Jordan  1:35:45
has there ever been a good Nigel Farage? Nope. And of Nigel's Yeah, I

Dan  1:35:54
can't go with another night. There's

Jordan  1:35:56
no good Nigel's when you get named Nigel shit is gonna go down. What about that

Dan  1:36:01
guy who was the librarian on Buffy the Vampire Slayer?

Jordan  1:36:04
Um, I'm pretty sure he was a vampire.

Dan  1:36:07
Nigel though.

Jordan  1:36:08
I don't know. I never watched Buffy the Vampire Slayer. It was like it was probably dig. Somebody's got to be named Nigel.

Dan  1:36:14
Anyway, Nigel McGuinness is on and he says some really fucked up things. The first is not as fucked up. I don't like to include in our episodes, interview stuff because right?

Jordan  1:36:27
Just because then we'll take it out of Yeah, it's

Dan  1:36:30
too unwieldy. Yeah, but I felt like this was a special circumstance because of the second clip. But the first one real shitty. Okay.

Owen Shroyer  1:36:39
God, there's still so much winning. And isn't it fun? I mean, I don't I was pretty young when Reagan was, but I don't remember a presidency ever being so fun.

Dan  1:36:50
Wow. I have never remembered a presidency being so fun. Um, what a fun president.

Jordan  1:36:57
You know what? Okay. All right. If you were an alien, this would be the most fun presidency ever. If your skin if there was no skin in the game, this would be a hilarious presidency.

Dan  1:37:13
Also, if you're an uncaring white person.

Jordan  1:37:16
Yeah. It's pretty fun. Yeah. Well, I assume they're, I assume they're aliens. It's pretty tough because they have no recognition of the real world.

Dan  1:37:25
It's pretty tough to hear the stories of ice checkpoints.

Jordan  1:37:31
You know? Do you know what's crazy about that? I go through all of these conservative websites because I am obsessed with making sure that I get every possible viewpoint me too. And all of the all of the like, not even liberal, just like reputable news sources, interview the people interview the people affected by this. And there are all these stories that are just fucking tragic. Every time I go one step to the right, to any right wing anything, zero interviews with people, it is all just ideologically this makes sense. On principle,

Dan  1:38:12
never fuck them. Because they are exactly legally

Jordan  1:38:15
they're not here at them. They're not ours. They're not people to you. So have they don't have rights. Of course, if you never got any information outside of those places, you would think this is the right thing to do. Because you never have to deal with people. Yeah, but all of these all of these supposedly Christian conservatives, you really get into a narrative with them. If you really get them to meet any of these people. They would almost immediately change their minds. Hopefully, because they're people. If you if you just finally fucking recognize that other people are the same as you instead of some weird monster, incentive some weird other thing, the moment you just fucking meet people, man. Just do it. Jordan, I'm so angry. I'm so angry about this man. You're a dumb COC because you know, that's a good point.

Dan  1:39:08
You don't realize this fucking presidency is full. Oh, it is

Jordan  1:39:13
fun. Oh, man, it is. God. How fun is I wish both so man I wish I weren't affected by this because this chaos is what I would like if I watch Oh, funny to see people scared if I was. If I was watching a basketball game. That was basically the corollary to this where it's all chaos. People are punching each other for no reason. It's so outside of what a basketball like when

Dan  1:39:40
you're watching. It's like a Globetrotters game mixed with pro wrestling. Yes, exactly.

Jordan  1:39:45
Like when you're watching stand up. If you've been a stand up for long enough, suddenly the only thing that becomes really fun is when Stand Up goes beyond the rails saying yeah, I don't want to see bad stand up. Now. I will Like seeing people try to become good at stand up. Yes, I love watching great stand up. But my favorite thing is a fucking lunatic walking on stage and just letting shit

Dan  1:40:12
fly or the flip side of that is watching someone, you know, be in a bad situation. So it's either chaos from the stage or towards the state. Yeah,

Jordan  1:40:22
absolutely. Yeah. I want to see I want to see shit I've never seen

Dan  1:40:27
before. And that's what this guy is kind of espousing. Yeah, it was a politics, but it hurts people. Yeah.

Jordan  1:40:32
In terms of comedy. That's great. There's you want to see shit you've never seen before of stakes in terms of the World Government. Not good. Not good. Legitimately

Dan  1:40:44
families are being broken up. And it's frankly,

Jordan  1:40:46
frankly, even the shit we've seen before is usually bad. Pretty bad.

Dan  1:40:51
Yeah, yeah. So Nigel McGuinness is an asshole.

Jordan  1:40:55
Nigel McGuinness is anybody named Nigel is an asshole. So we have one more

Dan  1:40:59
clip left Jordan. Yes, sir, for this show. And it is in response to that show. Dear White People.

Jordan  1:41:08
Why? Why do we need a rose? Did

Dan  1:41:09
you watch that? Color

Dan  1:41:13
watched. I watched the thing. I haven't watched the show. It's good, cool, dry people.

Dan  1:41:19
I watched the trailer which is all they're responding to. Well,

Jordan  1:41:23
if they actually responded to reality, that would be a bummer.

Dan  1:41:27
They watched the trailer trailer is all just essentially don't do white face or blackface.

Jordan  1:41:35
Don't do don't do blackface. That's basically it's a bad idea to do blackface.

Dan  1:41:38
It's that's generally the pullover. Hey,

Jordan  1:41:43
don't do blackface.

Dan  1:41:44
That's not cool. I am not a costume, basically, is the line of the trailer.

Jordan  1:41:49
That's actually a really good line. Yeah. Unless you're a clown. If you're a clown live in New York. You are a costume. Yeah,

Dan  1:41:55
I knew no, it knew. Yeah. God damn clown.

Jordan  1:41:58
Right. No, no. chondrites that's where I draw the line clown. Right. Clown rights fail. Thank you.

Dan  1:42:06
So here is him discussing this. Nigel McGuinness ended up saying one of the worst things I've heard said on Alex Jones's show. At the end of this.

Unknown Speaker  1:42:17
Oh, God. I don't know. I mean, my theory is that a lot of these TV execs are divorced women with an axe to grind, divorce Liberal Democrats, and they don't like men, they white men because it reminds them of their ex husband, and they're just revenge. It's got the free market doesn't want that show. I mean, look at the number of dislikes that that trailer has on YouTube. It's something like 30,000 to 2000 Likes. It's probably the most rejected video in the history of of YouTube trailers. And it's because it doesn't make sense. I mean, you're going to come to a party because you found the costumes offensive and you're going to destroy all our PA system. What's that? 1500 bucks you just destroyed because you've

Alex Jones  1:43:02
white people are really having blackface parties. I mean, they are. I grew up in the South never heard of such a thing. Yes. You

Unknown Speaker  1:43:09
have probably happened six times in the past 10 years. So but every time you

Jordan  1:43:14
so many times now I've done a little

Dan  1:43:15
bit of research on this.

Jordan  1:43:17
It never happened to the south, the South. It's never happened to the south. Well, I just googled it happens in the north often enough for me to be angry about it. I just

Dan  1:43:27
Googled black face parties, college, all black

Jordan  1:43:31
face College, all bright calm. That would be a fun college to go to

Dan  1:43:37
or reality show. Albright College and Snapchat when

Jordan  1:43:42
people stop being polite, and start wearing

Dan  1:43:45
blackface. There was a whole blackface narrative on The Real World Road Rules challenge. Like three seasons back. It was really bizarre. I can't explain it now.

Jordan  1:43:54
There's no way to explain it ever.

Dan  1:43:56
It worked out really well, though. Great. I'll tell you all fair. Okay. It had to do with C T. My dear friends. Okay. All right. Albright College and Snapchat blackface scandal from September 29 2016. Okay, Pennsylvania College students suspended over blackface video October 3 2016. So we've only got two white college student dresses as Bill Cosby in blackface. October 31 2016. All right. So that's just three and that was Halloween. blackface on college campuses isn't about freedom of speech. That was also from Halloween, I think might have been from a conservative source. Okay, so maybe that's for Arkansas student expelled from frat for blackface Cosby costume that was a different one. Also Cosby from the 30th All right, so that's five Texas students expelled for posing in blackface on snapchat video November 14 2016. Okay, so maybe that Kansas State students sorry, but denies it was black face.

Jordan  1:44:54
How do you deny it's black man, September

Dan  1:44:56
16 2016. I'll explain how I She had like a facial mask on. Okay, like maybe it was a facial scrub kind of mask. It made her face black. And she posed with four of her friends and snapchatted it with the the message. Okay, now I know what it feels like to be a nigga. Oh, no,

Jordan  1:45:21
no better. No. Yeah, no,

Dan  1:45:24
that's what she did. No, she's like, sorry, it wasn't blackface. I was just in a facial scrub. Well, what, wait,

Jordan  1:45:31
no, you said no. It is the face is not the issue on this one. But it's also the issue.

Dan  1:45:38
It becomes blackface. When you use racial slurs and your SNAP, you should

Jordan  1:45:43
probably not use racial slurs. If you're a racist, North Dakota

Dan  1:45:47
white student dress in blackface post pictures, September 24 2016.

Jordan  1:45:53
I can't imagine how many look that's six or seven or eight cases in a span of three months. In one year

Dan  1:46:03
college student he lived in this house for 20 Nights. 26 times. Maybe that's nine. Yeah. So when he says it's been six or seven cases in the last 10 years? Well, it's been six months.

Jordan  1:46:18
Yeah, but I mean, he grew up in the South. Those weren't

Dan  1:46:22
all right. Nigel McGuinness or Alex Jones. Who cares?

Jordan  1:46:25
There's a lot of blackface white people are racist. There's

Dan  1:46:29
there's tons of this shit. So when it comes down to

Jordan  1:46:31
I want to I want to make a joke, but I'm just filled with fucking fuck you.

Dan  1:46:36
It's so easy to find luck, you it's so for Google a thing. It's so easy to find instances of this happening. It should never happen. And when people were like, listen, it wasn't racist. Then you find the Snapchat picture? Yeah, it has the N word on it. Yeah, like Okay, fuck off. Yeah, you have no leg to stand on. No, but Nigel has more fucking like, he doesn't realize that we just talked about is the reality. Right. So he has more things to say that make it

Jordan  1:47:09
way worse. Oh, great.

Unknown Speaker  1:47:11
See it? It gets blown up. It's all over the news. And the next thing you know, they're pretending that it's a trend. Oh, how

Alex Jones  1:47:17
do we know what isn't leftist doing false flags. They're all in the yard. Or swastikas on the Jewish dorm? I mean, what 900 times out of out of one.

Jordan  1:47:28
All right. All right. You're leftist. Yeah. Look at me in the eyes. How great is the plan to draw a swastika at a Jewish dorm. Great. It's great. Isn't that a brilliant landscape? Plan? One, no one will ever know. It's you.

Dan  1:47:46
Well, there has actually been a couple of instances of that. Really? Yeah. There have been a couple instances but the large majority are actual hate crimes.

Jordan  1:47:55
Why is it Yeah, well, of course there are a couple it's ah, I hate I hate it that math sometimes makes that happen. Yeah, like

Dan  1:48:03
2%. Yeah, and that's generous. Yeah, exactly. Hate Crimes are perpetrated by the victimized class trying to make the perpetrators look

Jordan  1:48:13
worse. Well, there's, there's a story of a there's a story of a dude who was married to it was a white dude married to a black woman. He thought she was gonna leave him so he put all of this like Nazi or like KK shit. Had a burning cross in the yard going like, oh, well, you shouldn't leave me because it's scary out there. And it was very obvious that it was like, hey, you know, the K K K has never asked you to stay where you are. So you leave yet? K K. K is usually like go away. Not like, hey, you need to stay with your boyfriend

Dan  1:48:48
or something. It's usually a warning. Yeah, exactly. One thing K K K isn't into his miscegenation. Yeah. They're not big fans. But like, yeah, it is that really unfortunate thing that that reality does exist. Yeah. But

Jordan  1:49:02
statistically, anything that can happen will happen.

Dan  1:49:05
The bigger issue is that does not preclude us from really dealing with the actual hate crimes that do exist. Do you mean all the hate crimes 98% of us so

Jordan  1:49:17
many of those. And I chose

Dan  1:49:19
that 2% arbitrarily. I'm

Jordan  1:49:21
sure it's way, way fewer. But anyway, the fact that you the fact that you have an anecdote about it suggests how rare it is. I have a that's the but that's the that's the whole thing. If you Google the opposite, you can pull up 300 instances. But you're going to remember the unique one I just did. Exactly. Exactly. You just started reading off of a list. Yeah, but you

Dan  1:49:46
remember the one that is eight from the six months you just passed. You remember the

Jordan  1:49:51
one that is the false flag because that's so unique. You would report on it like if you're a news agency, why would you report On the same fucking racist shit that goes on every goddamn day

Dan  1:50:05
more swastikas painted on New York subway Yeah,

Jordan  1:50:08
which by the way that video of people cleaning the shit up gorgeous all getting together like being like fuck you. God that's beautiful. They're restores your faith sigh

Dan  1:50:19
up. Yeah. sigh up anyway, Nigel is about to say some horrible shit

Jordan  1:50:27
Nigel bring us home.

Alex Jones  1:50:29
I mean, it's staged.

Unknown Speaker  1:50:31
And here's the other crazy thing no one would ever bring up. blackface isn't offensive. It's just a given that it's offensive because it's related to Jim Crow. But if you go back and you look the way they did it in the 1800s, up 20% of the time, they were insulting but the other 80% it was somewhat reverent. It was just like a man dressing up as a woman in a play. And then in Britain, Europe, we've got Black Pete, and we've had the black and white minstrel show in Britain right up until the 80s. These people all they know is the taboos.

Dan  1:51:01
Fuck off. Jordan, that was crazy. blackface is not offensive. At the time, it was reverent.

Jordan  1:51:12
But, but but all the all of the all of all of it. Like all of it. Pretty much all of it, all of it. All of it. There's no, there. Okay. Give me Give me like you, you have at least a very basic understanding of race relations in this country.

Dan  1:51:35
I'll accept that as a premise. Give me

Jordan  1:51:37
one situation where blackface was okay.

Dan  1:51:41
Ever, ever

Dan  1:51:52
okay

Jordan  1:51:56
here we go. All right. Now because 80% of the time it was Reverend so that means that you should out of any 10 instances, eight of them should be okay.

Dan  1:52:09
Here's what I was gonna say. Let's go

Jordan  1:52:11
for one. Let's just start with one name one.

Dan  1:52:14
I was on my way to the set, and an oil barrel blew up in front of me. And I just show up on black and we have to adjust everybody

Jordan  1:52:27
laughs Yeah, it's a great time. I mean, you could always go back to Al Jolson, right. It's cloud Jolson is a giant pile of shit. But in context of the world he lived in, he's not the one who made it possible for him to be

Dan  1:52:45
that we're so about to lose your voice. I'm

Jordan  1:52:47
so about to lose my voice. I sound exactly like Alex Jones right now.

Dan  1:52:52
Who would you like to pitch some products?

Jordan  1:52:54
Let me tell you. Let me tell you something about Super Male Vitality. If only I took more of it before

Dan  1:53:01
today, yeah. Also, like all of it, all of it comes down to like, let's not relitigate the history. Right? Who cares?

Jordan  1:53:12
What we're talking about? Well, I mean, it is super important that you know the history in order to make sure that you don't fucking do blackface,

Dan  1:53:20
certainly, certainly. But let's take that away and just address today. Okay, those people, bad. All the people that I just listed. Not good. And college campuses. Bad are not doing blackface to somehow celebrate black people.

Jordan  1:53:41
Are you sure it wasn't Reverend when she said the N word in a bunch of different ways? Probably at first probably probably. 80%. Reverend Yeah, probably 20% Not Reverend probably. God.

Dan  1:53:53
What a bunch of dicks. So anyway, this is this has been February 10. February 10. On the Alex Jones Show, Jordan this has been fun. This is always a delight. I hate Nigel McGuinness more than I did earlier.

Jordan  1:54:07
Most Nigel should die. Yeah,

Dan  1:54:09
they think they're probably assholes. Yep, sorry. Any good Nigel's out there. I'd love to know you.

Jordan  1:54:15
That's why I said most Yeah. Now if the rest of the Nigel's are wearing blackface right now. You know what? I take it back.

Dan  1:54:22
Shout out to any solid Nigel. Find you will find

Jordan  1:54:29
anybody who is wearing blackface reverently. If there's one or 2% of people do it false flag operation. Oh, Jesus, then there has to be at least one dude doing blackface. So reverently. So reverently
