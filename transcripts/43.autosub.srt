1
00:00:04,096 --> 00:00:10,240
Alexandra Thurston color with huge fan I love your work

2
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:12,544
You and yours this is

3
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:13,824
Does the podcast where

4
00:00:14,592 --> 00:00:17,408
We're couple dudes bike Smithtown

5
00:00:19,456 --> 00:00:20,224
Nope cut it

6
00:00:21,504 --> 00:00:27,648
I wished everyone happy Friday

7
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:31,488
Don't know anybody

8
00:00:31,744 --> 00:00:33,536
Friday before they were very

9
00:00:36,096 --> 00:00:42,240
Happy Friday happy Friday to you too we like to drink red wine and talk a little bit about Alex Jones

10
00:00:42,496 --> 00:00:45,312
And what he is up to

11
00:00:45,824 --> 00:00:48,128
Now in order to make

12
00:00:48,384 --> 00:00:49,408
So people don't

13
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:52,480
Alex Jones

14
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:53,760
It is boring

15
00:00:54,016 --> 00:00:57,600
Is there like a reason that it's you and me

16
00:01:00,416 --> 00:01:02,208
Because I don't know anything about

17
00:01:03,488 --> 00:01:09,632
What makes this Dynamic work

18
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:13,216
Let's just jump to our out-of-context drop coming to us

19
00:01:13,472 --> 00:01:16,544
From deep in the past I found this clip

20
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:17,312
And it's hilarious

21
00:01:28,064 --> 00:01:29,600
You are

22
00:01:31,904 --> 00:01:34,976
The sperm count

23
00:01:35,232 --> 00:01:39,328
That's right across the board

24
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:48,032
Super male vitality

25
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:49,568
Except so that was a

26
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:56,736
So I've mentioned that I'm going back and doing an in-depth investigation and Research into Alex's past

27
00:01:56,992 --> 00:01:59,296
And sometimes episodes will not end up

28
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:01,856
Marrying an entire episode of our show

29
00:02:02,112 --> 00:02:08,256
But something like that gets sad when we got it we got to tell the people everybody

30
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:12,608
Across the West

31
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:23,616
Tic-tac-toe info it is

32
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:24,640
Private eye

33
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:32,064
The show off with a slight correction

34
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:36,416
80s episode we talked about Alex claiming that they were monkeys

35
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:41,280
I would wires in their head getting brainwashed with television

36
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:43,328
For the screaming monkey

37
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:49,728
A wonderful bar made fun of the idea that there is all this stuff going on in

38
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:50,496
Texas

39
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:53,568
I did not research

40
00:02:57,408 --> 00:02:59,712
I Googled Bastrop monkey

41
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:03,296
Monkey trials

42
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:04,832
With monkey in the title

43
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:05,856
And everything that came up

44
00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:07,136
Was nothing

45
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:08,416
For this bar

46
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:11,744
They're pointed out that there is

47
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,280
What is going on in Bastrop

48
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:15,072
Through the University of Texas

49
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,680
There were chimpanzees

50
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:21,472
And other monkeys

51
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:24,800
Right but still

52
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:29,152
Don't work we're slightly wrong

53
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:35,552
But we were wrong to clown on it like we did cuz there was

54
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:39,392
Middle middle

55
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:42,720
No

56
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:48,096
It is complicated there was like vaccine research and stuff like that that that

57
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:54,240
The reality has caused monkey autism

58
00:03:54,496 --> 00:04:00,640
The reality to though is that our country has a really bad track record with animal testing

59
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:04,224
So what's going on there

60
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:06,016
Isn't unbelievable

61
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:07,808
Describing

62
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:10,368
So it's like a we were wrong

63
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:11,904
We shouldn't have clowns

64
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:18,559
Maybe we should have landed this morning

65
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:19,583
Underneath

66
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,631
And we can all agree

67
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:23,679
That based on the fact that there was

68
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:25,727
Monkey research being done there

69
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:28,031
The name of that Tiki Bar is really shity

70
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:29,567
So

71
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:32,383
Hypothesize that it was

72
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:36,991
We are possible on a thing

73
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:39,295
With a a joke bar name

74
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:41,599
Anyway

75
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:43,647
Uber

76
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:50,047
That's that's not a great apology

77
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:55,167
This isn't really the message

78
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:07,711
I want to get to today or episode we're going to be talking about something happened on the Wednesday show

79
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:09,759
Which is May 17th

80
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:13,599
There was a continuation of the rest of the week

81
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:16,671
Which up till that point had been mostly

82
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:21,023
Bro downtime between Rodger Stone Alex Jones

83
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:24,351
Rodger Stone Mike cernovich soda filled in

84
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:31,775
I just

85
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:34,847
You know how that was sort of the theme of the week

86
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:37,919
Wednesday

87
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:43,551
In the back towards the third hour of the show something really really f***** up happen

88
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:44,831
That would be

89
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:46,111
What we talked about

90
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:47,135
For this episode

91
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:48,671
But because you asked

92
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:49,951
Meet before the show

93
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:52,255
And I did tweet out about this a bit

94
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:53,279
I want to

95
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:54,047
The cover

96
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:55,839
What he was doing on Thursday

97
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:57,631
Today as we record

98
00:05:58,143 --> 00:05:58,655
On Thursday

99
00:05:59,167 --> 00:05:59,679
Alex Jones

100
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:01,471
Higher

101
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:02,239
Joe

102
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:04,287
The entire show

103
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:06,335
Just talk about how cold

104
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:07,615
Is Buck

105
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:09,407
Jim Comey

106
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:10,687
Dead to rights

107
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:11,711
Busta

108
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:14,271
So as he would say

109
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:15,551
Metallic

110
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:17,855
Comey wrote this memo

111
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:19,903
Has been leaked

112
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:20,927
Disgust

113
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:22,975
This memo

114
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:23,999
What you got

115
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:28,351
Hard to get those words out

116
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:31,935
Tim or suggested

117
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:32,703
Should move on

118
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:33,727
From the flame

119
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:35,007
Investigation

120
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:39,103
Call Miro.

121
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:40,383
And then later

122
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:41,407
He was in front of

123
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:42,175
The Senate

124
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:44,735
Being questioned

125
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:46,527
And they asked him a question

126
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:48,319
And in his answer

127
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:49,599
He said that

128
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:51,903
Vietnam people have not asked him

129
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:52,927
To stop

130
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:54,975
You haven't been

131
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:56,255
Pressured

132
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:57,791
Now here's the important

133
00:06:58,303 --> 00:06:59,839
If that was all

134
00:07:00,351 --> 00:07:01,119
The information

135
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:03,679
How to have an interesting thing to go on

136
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:08,031
Misleading

137
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:09,823
For him to say I wasn't

138
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:16,735
Invalidate the memos

139
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:26,207
Called into question perjure himself when he was being

140
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:26,975
If

141
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:30,047
The most rational explanation

142
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:30,815
If

143
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:32,863
The reality isn't what I'm about to explain

144
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:35,167
If Alex's narrative is true

145
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:38,239
The most rational explanation

146
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:44,639
He is in the middle of a obstruction of justice building

147
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:45,663
So

148
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:46,431
Keyword

149
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:49,247
He would have to answer

150
00:07:57,183 --> 00:07:57,951
Maui

151
00:07:58,207 --> 00:07:58,975
Fortunately

152
00:07:59,487 --> 00:08:01,279
Alex is using this clip

153
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:02,815
That I'm about to play

154
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:04,351
His evidence

155
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:05,631
They call me

156
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:09,215
Busted

157
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:11,007
Probably 15 to 20 time

158
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:12,799
On the show on Thursday

159
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:13,823
And scream

160
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:16,127
Your dad call me

161
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:20,991
Let's knock on the table

162
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:25,087
Yeah but he didn't

163
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:30,463
Going

164
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:36,095
I will I will like

165
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:37,119
At work

166
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:39,423
Run around in a circle screaming

167
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:42,495
He does Shuffle papers around

168
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:44,799
But here is the clip

169
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:46,591
And it is from his

170
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:47,871
Testimony

171
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:49,151
5 front of the

172
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:51,711
Maybe

173
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:54,783
You'll immediately be able to tell

174
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:55,551
Why Alex

175
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:56,575
To the f****** liar

176
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:57,599
And he knows it

177
00:08:58,623 --> 00:08:59,135
Attorney General

178
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:01,695
Supposes

179
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:03,487
Investigation

180
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:04,255
Can they

181
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:08,607
In theory

182
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:10,911
As it

183
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:14,239
Because it would be a

184
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:15,007
Big deal

185
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:16,543
Tell the FBI to stop

186
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:19,359
Appropriate

187
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:20,895
We're often times

188
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:24,479
See a case there and soyou

189
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:25,503
Resources in it

190
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:28,575
I'm talking about a situation where we were told to stop

191
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:29,855
Political reasons

192
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:30,879
That would be a very big

193
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:36,767
So he says there is not happened in my experience

194
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:39,327
Now it's beginning really quick

195
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:41,375
Listen to the question that she asked

196
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:44,959
So is the attorney general senior officials at the D

197
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:45,727
Department of Justice

198
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:46,751
Does opposes

199
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:48,287
Investigation

200
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:50,079
All that

201
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:50,847
FBI

202
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:55,967
The Attorney General Department of Justice

203
00:09:56,735 --> 00:09:57,247
Not

204
00:09:57,759 --> 00:09:59,039
The president exactly

205
00:09:59,295 --> 00:10:03,391
Specifically asking about

206
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:04,159
Yeah

207
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:09,023
Sessions being a dick to you

208
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:12,095
That question

209
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:19,775
Has nothing to do with what Trump

210
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:21,055
Knows that

211
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:23,103
Keep playing this clip

212
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:27,711
Knowing that people are not going to understand what question told me was asked

213
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:30,783
It's diesel bad propagate that you should cut that out

214
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:36,671
What the f*** it's so obvious he's lying

215
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:38,207
It's insane

216
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:43,327
It's such a desperation move that the only thing you're good at

217
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:45,375
I think it's because he's been lucky

218
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:51,775
A bunch of really dumb people in bigots basically created is

219
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:53,055
Iraq

220
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:57,919
Yeah he's never really had to work

221
00:10:58,431 --> 00:10:59,455
So I think that's pretty much

222
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:00,479
What's going on

223
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:06,367
Excuse me

224
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:08,159
Who is it

225
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:10,719
I don't know

226
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:15,583
I was going to try and come up with a way to pretend that I was but I don't know

227
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:23,263
June from the jump on that one I'm telling you we got to take at least one

228
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:28,383
Who is it this is Alex Jones

229
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:35,039
Alex how are you would be Alex Jones because then he could have busted himself

230
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:40,159

00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:44,767

235
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:54,495
Oh my God Alex Jones

236
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:55,775

237
00:11:57,055 --> 00:11:57,567
You're busted

238
00:11:57,823 --> 00:12:03,967
I couldn't take that serious

239
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:09,855
Apparently

240
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:10,623
The day

241
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:12,927

Troy results

248
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:36,223
I want there to be some sexual tension between pjw and

249
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:36,991
Somebody

250
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:39,551

So on Wednesday after all that gets done

255
00:12:56,191 --> 00:12:57,215
Jerome corsi

256
00:12:57,983 --> 00:12:59,007
Big news

257
00:12:59,263 --> 00:12:59,775
Yeah right

258
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:00,799
Big news

259
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:02,591
The Washington bureau chief

260
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:04,127
Jerome corsi

261
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:07,711
Really needs to drop into Alex's lab

262
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:11,807
Play weird comparison

263
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:14,367
Basically says the Trump is a baby

264
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:20,255
This is so real and so sickening

265
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:25,887
Channel 10 times or whatever

266
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:30,495
I know he's real he cares about the country

267
00:13:58,911 --> 00:14:00,447
I was just so crazy

268
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:03,519
So yeah he's got a battle plan

269
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:06,591
Baby Trump

270
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:12,991
To protect baby drop from the red-eyed rats surrounded

271
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:16,319
Moniker for Trump

272
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:21,951
Baby truck

273
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:26,303
So

274
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:28,607
I'm going to just go ahead and lay out

275
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:30,399
In front of you

276
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:32,191
Dealing with

277
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:33,983
Okay

278
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:35,263
Jerome corsi

279
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:37,311
Comes on to Infowars

280
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:41,407
And basically describes what Infowars does

281
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:46,783
Right now I'm guessing he does not say

282
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:49,087
Here is what we do

283
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:51,135
She says here's what the globalist

284
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:51,903
Are doing

285
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:52,671
Trump

286
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:54,207
And basically

287
00:14:56,511 --> 00:14:58,303
Describes the Infowars

288
00:14:58,559 --> 00:14:59,839
Modus operandi

289
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:03,935
Now on top of that

290
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:08,799
They know their own jobs right

291
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:12,895
His battle plan is essentially wage a propaganda campaign

292
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:13,919
Against

293
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:14,943
These globulus

294
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:17,503
Who are using propaganda against

295
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:20,319
There a propaganda

296
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:22,623
The counter propagate

297
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:25,439
A counter-counter propagate

298
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:28,767
But the thing that's scary about it is

299
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:31,327
We do.

300
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:34,399
The idea that they're bringing it out into the open

301
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:36,703
Suggest something really nefarious

302
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:39,775
Okay so so they're already

303
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:45,919
But now they're doing the Gambit of telling you what we're doing no

304
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:46,943
In order to live

305
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:48,735
I think

306
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:49,759
NetZero

307
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:50,783
Banking on

308
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:53,855
Most people who don't like them not hearing this

309
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:55,903
And people who

310
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:57,183
Them hearing it

311
00:15:57,695 --> 00:15:58,719
And then they're in on it

312
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:00,255
Right

313
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:01,535
So it's like a wink

314
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:05,119
It's like oh we can get more people

315
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:06,655
Do you know where upfront about

316
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:09,983
Is Forza narrative

317
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:16,383
Okay no it's not now we're talkin we're recruiting the info

318
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:18,175
To be part of our propaganda

319
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:22,783
Campaign keeping them believing

320
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:25,343
Yeah

321
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:27,391
They're actively going

322
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:33,535
Leads me to believe the audience engagement

323
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:37,631
Hilarious

324
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:38,911
Later in the show

325
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:39,679
Clifford

326
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:42,495
Matter but Alex was on the phone

327
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:44,543
With a collar and the collar

328
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:46,591
Is maybe a minute into the colony like

329
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:47,871
Well you got some good points

330
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:49,663
I'll give you your own show

331
00:16:56,319 --> 00:17:01,183
By the way we're still waiting for that f******

332
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:02,207
Daffy Duck

333
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:03,999
That rapper who called in

334
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:10,399
Who is Alex offered to give Advil

335
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:11,423
Malik

336
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:15,263
What is promises

337
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:21,663
No no if anybody ever won that animation contest

338
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:23,455
From 2014

339
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:29,343
The animating contest of Liberty

340
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:30,111
Do all of

341
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:32,159
Deposit policy walks we would like

342
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:34,719
Animation

343
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:42,143
So much already I really

344
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:43,679
Please don't

345
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:45,471
Make it anime

346
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:52,383
Corsi is going to lay out some of them will get to

347
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:56,223
I think we'll get to my thesis as this develops

348
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:08,511
Well I'm Alex what I'm doing

349
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:11,583
This is something I've been specially trained

350
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:14,399
Issue disinformation and propaganda

351
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:19,519
Who is the father

352
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:20,543
Relations

353
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:26,431
Responsible for the

354
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:29,503
Gerbils propaganda

355
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:31,807
Answer

356
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:41,279
The techniques that work and don't work when you're under just information propaganda technique

357
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:42,559
Do you know who's a great guy

358
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:44,351
The guy who trained

359
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:47,935
Or whatever

360
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:49,471
Google's was

361
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:51,263
Very specifically

362
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:52,543
Vocally

363
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:53,823
Inspired

364
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:55,871
By the work of Edward Bernays

365
00:18:56,383 --> 00:18:57,919
Do you know about Edward Bernays

366
00:18:58,175 --> 00:18:59,967
I don't know

367
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:02,527
His uncle was Sigmund Freud

368
00:19:02,783 --> 00:19:03,807
But seriously

369
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:10,207
Why do they sell f*****-up news organization

370
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:11,487
Explaining fake news

371
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:12,255
And Coursey

372
00:19:12,511 --> 00:19:13,279
Just said

373
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:16,095
We're going to spread disinformation

374
00:19:16,351 --> 00:19:18,655
I was trained

375
00:19:18,911 --> 00:19:21,727
I was trained by Edward Bernays

376
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:24,543
I know about these things

377
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:26,335
I'm trained in this

378
00:19:26,591 --> 00:19:27,871
This is him trying to say like

379
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:30,175
Call Dad

380
00:19:30,943 --> 00:19:31,967
Let your boy ride

381
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:32,991
That kind of thing

382
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:35,039
Also another thing that's going to develop

383
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:41,439
His Alex doesn't understand about conversation

384
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:47,327
You'll get the sense that Alex does not want to be there at all these dismissive is if he had a

385
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:52,191
Super male Vitality laced hamburger in his hand

386
00:19:54,495 --> 00:19:55,007
Before we move on

387
00:19:55,263 --> 00:19:55,775
Alright

388
00:19:57,311 --> 00:19:58,079
His uncle was

389
00:19:58,335 --> 00:19:59,871
Sigmund Freud

390
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:00,639
I can't

391
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:01,407
Confirm this

392
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:11,135
What's the temperature be like

393
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:13,183
If you haven't uncle

394
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:15,487
One of your

395
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:18,303
Their husband dies and he marries

396
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:19,071
Your aunt

397
00:20:20,863 --> 00:20:21,631
Let the devil uncle

398
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:23,167
I believe

399
00:20:24,703 --> 00:20:26,751
And uncle and uncle

400
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:27,775
Right so

401
00:20:30,335 --> 00:20:31,871
Really

402
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:32,895
His double Ankh

403
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:36,735
I can tell really over play the relay

404
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:39,807
I listen to an interview with

405
00:20:41,343 --> 00:20:41,855
His daughter

406
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:43,647
The other day in preparation

407
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:48,511
No contact with Sigmund Freud after he went back to

408
00:20:52,863 --> 00:20:56,703
It's dubious how much of that was actually in itself a PR campaign

409
00:20:58,239 --> 00:21:04,383
You clearly inspired by The Works of Freud propaganda

410
00:21:05,407 --> 00:21:07,455
There's no part of what you

411
00:21:07,711 --> 00:21:08,223
You say that I can

412
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:09,503
Evertrust

413
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:13,087
If you spread propaganda also his daughter was saying that

414
00:21:13,343 --> 00:21:16,672
Throughout her whole life specifically made her feel stupid

415
00:21:17,184 --> 00:21:18,976
And always would say that she was stupid

416
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:21,536
Which kind of fits into his worldview

417
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:24,864
This kind of this whole thing

418
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:25,632
Was

419
00:21:25,888 --> 00:21:26,912
People as a whole

420
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:28,192
Are really stupid

421
00:21:28,448 --> 00:21:29,472
And they live like pack

422
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,264
And they're just heard

423
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,056
Is it need to be ushered in different direction

424
00:21:33,568 --> 00:21:35,104
How do I grill

425
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,664
Select group of really intelligent people

426
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:38,944
Who are the real

427
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:42,528
Power in the world who influence them for their own good

428
00:21:42,784 --> 00:21:45,856
Globalist know basically gold for the people

429
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:49,184
He's arguing for a benevolent

430
00:21:49,696 --> 00:21:50,464
Oligarchy

431
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:51,488
Somewhat

432
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:56,352
Somewhat but it but it's not really even an oligarchy cuz it is people like a advertise

433
00:22:02,496 --> 00:22:04,032
Well

434
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,080
We're going to get to

435
00:22:06,848 --> 00:22:08,128
The other problem is

436
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:10,176
The ivory propaganda

437
00:22:10,432 --> 00:22:11,200
I've read his book

438
00:22:12,224 --> 00:22:14,272
He's decidedly Pro propagate

439
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:15,808
He's not against

440
00:22:19,392 --> 00:22:21,440
He felt a little bit

441
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:27,840
A little bit better I didn't realize that this could be a tool used for evil

442
00:22:29,376 --> 00:22:32,192
In a lot of his public statements theme oblivious

443
00:22:32,448 --> 00:22:33,472
Of the idea

444
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:34,240
That like

445
00:22:35,264 --> 00:22:36,800
People

446
00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:38,592
Cuz he basically cautify

447
00:22:38,848 --> 00:22:39,872
In creative

448
00:22:40,128 --> 00:22:42,176
The art of public relations

449
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,224
But what he would do

450
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:44,992
Is he

451
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:49,600
His main contribution cuz I never study doesn't college or anything but I

452
00:22:49,856 --> 00:22:51,648
Some books on him and read his own books

453
00:22:52,928 --> 00:22:55,488
Whooping is he would take people want

454
00:22:58,048 --> 00:23:00,608
How you spy

455
00:23:00,864 --> 00:23:02,144
Over glamorized

456
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:02,912
Giving something

457
00:23:03,168 --> 00:23:05,728
Like attaching celebrities to a product

458
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:08,544
Pioneer that sort of thing

459
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:12,384
And then on top of that

460
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,176
Because you have celebrities

461
00:23:15,712 --> 00:23:17,760
It would make it appear that there was this entwined

462
00:23:18,016 --> 00:23:19,808
Elite Class

463
00:23:21,088 --> 00:23:22,624
What is most famous for

464
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:23,648
Is getting women

465
00:23:23,904 --> 00:23:24,416
Smoke

466
00:23:24,928 --> 00:23:25,952
Do you know anything about this

467
00:23:26,976 --> 00:23:30,560
Was this the one where it was like

468
00:23:31,072 --> 00:23:31,840
Ton of

469
00:23:32,864 --> 00:23:34,400
Medicinal you don't do it while you

470
00:23:34,656 --> 00:23:35,424
You're pregnant

471
00:23:35,936 --> 00:23:36,960
You should do it while your vacuum

472
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:37,728
You mean was it that

473
00:23:37,984 --> 00:23:38,496
It's not

474
00:23:38,752 --> 00:23:41,056
So he started working for the American Tobacco

475
00:23:41,568 --> 00:23:45,920
Lucky Strikes

476
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:48,480
Who for the most part it's formally avoided smoking

477
00:23:48,992 --> 00:23:49,760
The first

478
00:23:50,784 --> 00:23:52,320
Smoke cigarettes instead of eating

479
00:23:53,088 --> 00:23:56,416
By promoting the idea itself

480
00:23:56,672 --> 00:23:57,952
Using photographers artist

481
00:23:58,208 --> 00:23:59,488
Newspapers and magazines

482
00:23:59,744 --> 00:24:00,256
Supermoto

483
00:24:00,512 --> 00:24:01,792
Special Beauty in women

484
00:24:02,304 --> 00:24:04,096
Medical authorities were found to promote

485
00:24:04,352 --> 00:24:05,888
The choice of cigarettes over Suites

486
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:07,168
Homemakers

487
00:24:07,424 --> 00:24:09,984
Keeping cigarettes on hand with a social necessity

488
00:24:12,288 --> 00:24:13,568
When you're serving your

489
00:24:15,104 --> 00:24:21,248
Who smokes sure I want to make sure that you got it

490
00:24:21,504 --> 00:24:22,528
Yeah

491
00:24:22,784 --> 00:24:23,552
Kind of shity

492
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:26,368
Lizbeth on evolve 90

493
00:24:26,624 --> 00:24:27,136
1820s

494
00:24:27,392 --> 00:24:27,904
So like

495
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,744
You attack it from a modern evolve

496
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,024
Viewpoint

497
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,048
But back then

498
00:24:34,304 --> 00:24:39,168
It was just sort of like his Wild West everybody was just

499
00:24:39,424 --> 00:24:40,192
The death of me

500
00:24:40,448 --> 00:24:44,288
It's still shockingly horrible though

501
00:24:44,544 --> 00:24:45,056
Fitness

502
00:24:46,848 --> 00:24:48,384
So that kind of

503
00:24:50,176 --> 00:24:52,992
Make sure that

504
00:24:55,296 --> 00:24:56,832
The bet

505
00:24:57,088 --> 00:24:59,904
But then there was still a taboo about women's

506
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:00,928
Smoking in public

507
00:25:01,696 --> 00:25:03,744
So he had to create a cool new thing

508
00:25:04,256 --> 00:25:05,536
In order to make it okay for women

509
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:07,072
So he gots

510
00:25:07,328 --> 00:25:07,840
Actresses

511
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:15,776
And what he did is he told a bunch of

512
00:25:16,032 --> 00:25:17,824
Reporters

513
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:18,592
That's

514
00:25:18,848 --> 00:25:19,360
Suffragette

515
00:25:19,872 --> 00:25:20,384
We're going

516
00:25:20,896 --> 00:25:21,920
To start smoking

517
00:25:22,176 --> 00:25:23,456
Freedom torture

518
00:25:24,224 --> 00:25:26,528
As a symbol of their empowerment

519
00:25:27,296 --> 00:25:30,112
I feel these reporters also the pay plants

520
00:25:30,624 --> 00:25:31,392
In the parade

521
00:25:31,648 --> 00:25:32,672
Start smoking

522
00:25:32,928 --> 00:25:33,696
Through the parade

523
00:25:33,952 --> 00:25:34,720
And it became this

524
00:25:34,976 --> 00:25:35,488
Coupling

525
00:25:35,744 --> 00:25:37,536
Of women's empowerment with smoking

526
00:25:38,048 --> 00:25:38,816
And all of a sudden

527
00:25:39,072 --> 00:25:39,840
It was it was

528
00:25:40,096 --> 00:25:43,168
Cool for women to smoke and it was okay for them to do it in public

529
00:25:43,424 --> 00:25:49,568
It works amazing he's an evil genius totally is this created a New Prague

530
00:25:51,104 --> 00:25:57,248
Beyond chapter

531
00:25:58,528 --> 00:26:00,320
And that is that Lucky Strike

532
00:26:00,832 --> 00:26:02,624
Their packaging was green and red

533
00:26:03,136 --> 00:26:05,440
A green with a very unfashionable color

534
00:26:05,952 --> 00:26:09,024
The women didn't want to smoke Lucky Strikes they smoked other brands

535
00:26:09,536 --> 00:26:12,096
Because green packaging would Clash with their attire

536
00:26:12,352 --> 00:26:13,120
Animated videos

537
00:26:13,376 --> 00:26:13,888
Didn't want to do it

538
00:26:14,144 --> 00:26:16,704
So now bearnaise had to figure out what to do about this

539
00:26:17,984 --> 00:26:20,800
Was he threw the stick called the green ball

540
00:26:21,312 --> 00:26:23,360
We're here

541
00:26:23,616 --> 00:26:25,408
And have them all wear green dresses

542
00:26:26,176 --> 00:26:31,552
Manufacturers and retailers of clothing and accessories were advised of the excitement growing around the color green

543
00:26:31,808 --> 00:26:34,112
Intellectuals highbrow talk

544
00:26:35,904 --> 00:26:37,696
Actually taking place

545
00:26:37,952 --> 00:26:39,232
Newspapers and magazines

546
00:26:39,488 --> 00:26:41,792
Encouraged in various Ways by Bernays office

547
00:26:42,048 --> 00:26:45,120
With all the rage

548
00:26:45,888 --> 00:26:47,424
And all of a sudden everything was okay

549
00:26:47,936 --> 00:26:49,216
People started buying Lucky Strikes

550
00:26:49,728 --> 00:26:51,008
Women smoking in public

551
00:26:51,264 --> 00:26:52,544
Everything was great

552
00:26:53,568 --> 00:26:54,336
So now I'm

553
00:26:54,592 --> 00:26:57,920
Completely on inside everybody's dumb they're pack animals f******

554
00:26:58,432 --> 00:26:59,200
This is awful

555
00:27:01,504 --> 00:27:07,648
No but this is going to be a real rollercoaster ride for you

556
00:27:10,976 --> 00:27:12,512
What is what am I doing here

557
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:17,632
Why am I wearing clothes

558
00:27:18,656 --> 00:27:21,984
Bernaise did like 60 years ago

559
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,544
Really fighting the good fight against propaganda

560
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:26,080
The Unabomber

561
00:27:28,384 --> 00:27:28,896
Some truth to that

562
00:27:30,176 --> 00:27:32,736
That was kind of like a fascinating competent

563
00:27:32,992 --> 00:27:33,504
Story

564
00:27:34,016 --> 00:27:34,528
Edward Bernays

565
00:27:34,784 --> 00:27:35,296
Yes

566
00:27:35,552 --> 00:27:37,088
Unfortunately as we mention

567
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,880
He also inspired

568
00:27:39,136 --> 00:27:39,648
Gerbils

569
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:40,928
And then

570
00:27:41,184 --> 00:27:44,768
The propaganda campaign was a huge part of it being able to succeed

571
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:46,816
Because without the propaganda

572
00:27:47,328 --> 00:27:50,912
You wouldn't have gotten that bad

573
00:27:51,168 --> 00:27:54,240
The powerlifter take a pool

574
00:27:54,496 --> 00:27:56,288
Make make tons of pronoun

575
00:27:56,544 --> 00:27:57,824
Nazi movies

576
00:27:58,848 --> 00:27:59,872
Like that is a brilliant

577
00:28:00,384 --> 00:28:02,688
A brilliant idea to do that and then he had a s*** ton

578
00:28:02,944 --> 00:28:03,456
Critics I'm

579
00:28:03,712 --> 00:28:06,272
I'm sure give them very positive

580
00:28:06,528 --> 00:28:07,808
Reviews so that would influence me

581
00:28:09,088 --> 00:28:11,392
Movies and then I'm

582
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:14,208
At the very least

583
00:28:14,464 --> 00:28:17,536
To make sure she started

584
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:20,352
I don't know

585
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:25,472
Something that's a little bit more direct

586
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,544
About brene to blame him

587
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:29,312
For the Holocaust

588
00:28:30,848 --> 00:28:33,920
People were just inspired by him

589
00:28:36,992 --> 00:28:41,088
Company hired bearnaise

590
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:43,392
To try and get bananas

591
00:28:43,648 --> 00:28:48,512
To be popular in America is like a really weird exotic

592
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:51,584
They are much more popular now

593
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:52,352
Chickasha

594
00:28:52,864 --> 00:28:55,680
So we got to really better for you

595
00:28:55,936 --> 00:28:57,216
Absolutely

596
00:28:59,008 --> 00:28:59,776
So I

597
00:29:00,288 --> 00:29:02,336
You tried a bunch of his normal tricks

598
00:29:02,848 --> 00:29:05,152
Like placing bananas

599
00:29:05,408 --> 00:29:07,712
Prominent places public

600
00:29:07,968 --> 00:29:09,504
Consult like that

601
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:15,648
He tried to get celebrities to get onboard a yellow ball

602
00:29:17,184 --> 00:29:21,536
It was quite working there was no progress being made

603
00:29:21,792 --> 00:29:22,560
What they needed

604
00:29:23,072 --> 00:29:27,680
Supernews also argued that United Fruit needed to put a positive spin on the banana growing

605
00:29:27,936 --> 00:29:28,704
Countries themselves

606
00:29:29,472 --> 00:29:30,240
And for this purpose

607
00:29:30,496 --> 00:29:34,080
He created a front group called the middle American information Bureau

608
00:29:34,336 --> 00:29:35,104
Which supplied

609
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,896
Information to journalists and academics

610
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:37,920
The mace

611
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:40,480
He has no expertise in Middle America

612
00:29:40,736 --> 00:29:42,528
He had no reason to do this

613
00:29:42,784 --> 00:29:43,808
That's pretty f*****-up

614
00:29:44,576 --> 00:29:45,856
48

615
00:29:46,112 --> 00:29:50,464
Getting paid $1,000 a year for days worked on the national press

616
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:54,048
And successfully drummed up coverage of Guatemala's communist Menace

617
00:29:56,608 --> 00:29:57,376
Protect business interest

618
00:29:57,632 --> 00:29:58,144
Boston Latin America

619
00:30:00,192 --> 00:30:04,800
He's the reason that Guatemala became a Banana Republic

620
00:30:05,056 --> 00:30:05,568
Oh yeah

621
00:30:06,592 --> 00:30:10,432
Guatemala

622
00:30:10,688 --> 00:30:12,480
Disabled Banana Republic

623
00:30:12,736 --> 00:30:15,808
Probably don't know

624
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:20,928
Yeah yeah

625
00:30:21,184 --> 00:30:21,696
So

626
00:30:21,952 --> 00:30:23,744
1920s

627
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:28,864
Totally

628
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:31,168
Yeah so in

629
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:33,984
Harappa Bernie strategy

630
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,544
Distributed favorable articles

Report on Guatemala to every member of Congress

632
00:30:40,384 --> 00:30:42,176
International opinion molders

633
00:30:42,432 --> 00:30:46,528
They also published a weekly Guatemala newsletter 250 journalist

634
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:49,344
Someone who used it as a source for their reporting

635
00:30:49,856 --> 00:30:54,976
In June 1954 the US Central Intelligence Agency affected

636
00:30:55,232 --> 00:30:57,280
Named Operation success

637
00:30:57,792 --> 00:31:00,608
Minimal military force

638
00:31:00,864 --> 00:31:03,168
Fronted by Carlos Castillo

639
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:06,752
With the psychological Warfare campaign to portray military

640
00:31:07,008 --> 00:31:08,544
Defeat as a foregone conclusion

641
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:09,312
Iraq

642
00:31:09,568 --> 00:31:10,080
Iraq

643
00:31:10,592 --> 00:31:11,104
Iraq

644
00:31:11,616 --> 00:31:13,664
Iraq the entire

645
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:16,736
The entire the entire I know

646
00:31:16,992 --> 00:31:22,880
Beat up to it to was heavily involved with

647
00:31:23,136 --> 00:31:24,160
These Publications

648
00:31:24,672 --> 00:31:25,184
And helping out

649
00:31:27,232 --> 00:31:31,328
He gave people tours of Guatemala politicians and journalists alike

650
00:31:31,584 --> 00:31:34,656
And all that in the heavily involved

651
00:31:34,912 --> 00:31:35,424
And this is

652
00:31:37,472 --> 00:31:41,312
Get a hundred thousand dollars

653
00:31:41,568 --> 00:31:46,688
So as soon as Castillo armaf took power he began to jail is opponents killing many

654
00:31:46,944 --> 00:31:50,528
Historians estimate the number of agricultural workers who killed to be in the thousands

655
00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:51,296
Just a m

656
00:31:52,576 --> 00:31:55,904
All political parties unions and peasant organizations were outlawed

657
00:31:56,160 --> 00:32:00,256
The outlawed voting by Guatemala population

658
00:32:00,768 --> 00:32:03,328
The Constitution

659
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,632
There were tons of attempted coups

660
00:32:05,888 --> 00:32:09,984
Until they all failed 57

661
00:32:11,008 --> 00:32:13,568
Elections were held following Castillo Armada

662
00:32:13,824 --> 00:32:17,408
In which the Centrist Ortiz passarello

663
00:32:17,664 --> 00:32:18,432
Wonderful reality

664
00:32:18,688 --> 00:32:19,200
However

665
00:32:19,456 --> 00:32:19,968
Supporters of

666
00:32:20,224 --> 00:32:21,248
Miguel degorious

667
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:22,272
20

668
00:32:22,528 --> 00:32:24,832
Who had been a candidate in the election

669
00:32:25,088 --> 00:32:30,208
After which the Army seized power in an old the result and another election was held

670
00:32:30,464 --> 00:32:32,768
Decorrius Fuentes won this election by

671
00:32:33,024 --> 00:32:33,792
Comfortable margin

672
00:32:34,048 --> 00:32:35,328
And soon after work

673
00:32:36,352 --> 00:32:42,496
Soon afterwards after the Army invalidated the previous one

674
00:32:43,008 --> 00:32:44,800
Crazy that the guy that they like

675
00:32:46,592 --> 00:32:49,664
Soon afterward he declared a state of Siege and please Power

676
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:55,296
The by overthrowing

677
00:32:55,552 --> 00:32:57,344
The former leader of Guatemala

678
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:01,696
This ended up undermining its own initial goal of the Guatemalan government

679
00:33:02,208 --> 00:33:06,304
Historian Stephen Streeter is stated that

680
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:08,864
By installing the malleable Castillo Armada

681
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:09,632
President

682
00:33:09,888 --> 00:33:12,448
So at the cost of Guatemala's democratic

683
00:33:12,704 --> 00:33:13,216
Institution

684
00:33:13,728 --> 00:33:15,264
Justin Bieber

685
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:16,288
Learned their lesson

686
00:33:16,544 --> 00:33:19,104
Nope and never did that again

687
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:20,640
Sentence of this whole thing

688
00:33:21,152 --> 00:33:25,760
The rolling back of the progressive policies in the previous civilian governments resulted in a series of

689
00:33:26,016 --> 00:33:28,576
Distance urgency in the countryside beginning in 1960

690
00:33:29,088 --> 00:33:30,880
This triggers a 36

691
00:33:31,136 --> 00:33:34,720
Guatemalan civil war between the US military government

692
00:33:34,976 --> 00:33:40,096
The frequently had a large degree of popular support

693
00:33:40,608 --> 00:33:42,144
The Civil War ran from 1960

694
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,680
1996

695
00:33:43,936 --> 00:33:45,728
Costing the lives of 200,000

696
00:33:45,984 --> 00:33:46,496
Civilian

697
00:33:46,752 --> 00:33:50,592
Atrocities against civilians

698
00:33:50,848 --> 00:33:54,688
93% of these violations were committed by the United States backed military

699
00:33:54,944 --> 00:33:57,248
Including a genocide all scorched-earth campaign

700
00:33:57,504 --> 00:33:59,808
Against the indigenous Maya population in the air

701
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:01,344
Hey you know what's great

702
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:03,392
We're the good guys

703
00:34:03,648 --> 00:34:08,256
Around the world

704
00:34:08,512 --> 00:34:10,304
Ethics that's what America does

705
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:16,704
I hate it when every Market prosperity

706
00:34:19,008 --> 00:34:20,544
God dammit

707
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:21,312
I know it's dark

708
00:34:21,568 --> 00:34:22,848
We're so evil

709
00:34:23,104 --> 00:34:26,432
But the reason I went into all that explains

710
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:31,808
3536

711
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:34,368
Is it was part of a propaganda campaign

712
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:35,904
Put on

713
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:36,672
Bananas

714
00:34:37,952 --> 00:34:40,512
Orchestrated by Edward

715
00:34:40,768 --> 00:34:42,560
This kind of massive Fallout

716
00:34:42,816 --> 00:34:47,680
Now at the same time we can't relive gate history in know what would have happened if they hadn't

717
00:34:48,448 --> 00:34:49,984
But it definitely wouldn't

718
00:34:51,008 --> 00:34:52,288
There were there was

719
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:53,312
Trouble

720
00:34:53,568 --> 00:34:56,128
Guatemala before but it wasn't nearly this severe

721
00:34:56,640 --> 00:35:02,784
They had any other situation where that at has has occurred like I'm sure

722
00:35:03,808 --> 00:35:05,088
Most of the Middle East has

723
00:35:05,344 --> 00:35:07,904
Very popular with

724
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:08,672
Without are in a

725
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:12,768
Negative never overthrown the government

726
00:35:15,072 --> 00:35:18,656
A religious

727
00:35:19,168 --> 00:35:21,216
I'm sure we never did abolish the government

728
00:35:21,472 --> 00:35:24,544
And cause another civil war

729
00:35:25,824 --> 00:35:29,152
20 years now forever now I'm sure we've never created

730
00:35:29,408 --> 00:35:35,552
Terrorist f****** groups around the world

731
00:35:37,088 --> 00:35:41,184
Get this 73 Edward Bernays was hired

732
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:41,952
2

733
00:35:42,464 --> 00:35:43,488
Try and make kumquat

734
00:35:43,744 --> 00:35:44,256
Popular

735
00:35:45,024 --> 00:35:49,120
This is what happened in Iran

736
00:35:50,912 --> 00:35:51,680
You pick the funniest

737
00:35:52,192 --> 00:35:54,496
I don't know if kumquats Duran

738
00:35:54,752 --> 00:35:56,800
What a beautiful

739
00:35:57,824 --> 00:35:58,592
His trick

740
00:35:58,848 --> 00:35:59,616
That he uses

741
00:35:59,872 --> 00:36:00,896
Are generally

742
00:36:01,152 --> 00:36:02,176
Nefarious reasons

743
00:36:03,968 --> 00:36:04,992
2

744
00:36:05,248 --> 00:36:07,040
Propagandistic Lee

745
00:36:07,552 --> 00:36:11,648
Even himself he makes the argument

746
00:36:11,904 --> 00:36:12,416
Quickly

747
00:36:12,928 --> 00:36:13,440
Neutral

748
00:36:13,952 --> 00:36:20,096
What his one of his most famous arguments about it was that there was there was this famous

749
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:25,984
Who cut her hair really short and I became popular really short hair

750
00:36:26,496 --> 00:36:28,544
Does it make a difference if

751
00:36:30,592 --> 00:36:32,896
Influenced her to do that or she did it on her own

752
00:36:33,152 --> 00:36:35,200
The end result is that women get short hair

753
00:36:35,456 --> 00:36:36,992
Who cares if it was propaganda or not

754
00:36:38,016 --> 00:36:38,528
Which is

755
00:36:38,784 --> 00:36:42,368
Right so his argument is that propaganda is just

756
00:36:42,624 --> 00:36:43,392
A control

757
00:36:43,648 --> 00:36:44,160
Fat

758
00:36:45,184 --> 00:36:46,464
The Kills 200,000

759
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:47,488
Billions + 36

760
00:36:47,744 --> 00:36:49,536
Sears in Guatemala

761
00:36:50,048 --> 00:36:51,072
But this is true

762
00:36:51,328 --> 00:36:52,352
Every year

763
00:36:52,608 --> 00:36:55,168
Hundreds of thousands of women died because their hair is

764
00:36:55,936 --> 00:36:57,216
Did you not know that I didn't know that

765
00:36:57,472 --> 00:36:58,240
Short hair

766
00:36:58,752 --> 00:36:59,520
What causes heartburn

767
00:37:01,824 --> 00:37:02,336
It makes

768
00:37:02,592 --> 00:37:04,896
Ethically neutral

769
00:37:05,152 --> 00:37:08,992
New conception of the world there's all these people were being influence

770
00:37:09,504 --> 00:37:12,064
Essentially

771
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:13,088
Utopian

772
00:37:13,344 --> 00:37:13,856
Is

773
00:37:14,112 --> 00:37:19,232
Good propaganda force is doing battle with evil propaganda forces

774
00:37:23,328 --> 00:37:25,888
And then these two competing forces of liars

775
00:37:26,144 --> 00:37:27,680
Who tried to

776
00:37:27,936 --> 00:37:30,496
Oh great I'm really glad that that

777
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:32,032
Man

778
00:37:32,288 --> 00:37:33,312
He is so right

779
00:37:33,824 --> 00:37:35,360
Evil

780
00:37:35,616 --> 00:37:39,712
Like that is kind of what we're living in right now he isn't eating propaganda

781
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:46,368
Totally

782
00:37:46,624 --> 00:37:47,648
No no

783
00:37:49,696 --> 00:37:50,208
Trained

784
00:37:50,464 --> 00:37:51,232
Jerome corsi

785
00:37:55,840 --> 00:38:01,472
Sweet like I can't find any degrees or anything that would match up but you did get into teaching

786
00:38:01,728 --> 00:38:02,752
Later in his life

787
00:38:03,264 --> 00:38:04,800
Baseball scores

788
00:38:05,056 --> 00:38:10,944
Course he's like 70 so they're timeline

789
00:38:11,968 --> 00:38:16,320
One year before the end of the Civil War

790
00:38:16,576 --> 00:38:17,088
Yeah it's

791
00:38:17,344 --> 00:38:18,368
Sweet

792
00:38:18,624 --> 00:38:19,392
You look 100

793
00:38:19,648 --> 00:38:20,672
32 I give a

794
00:38:20,928 --> 00:38:21,440
You made it

795
00:38:21,696 --> 00:38:25,536
Stop to the blood of every Guatemalan child that died

796
00:38:27,328 --> 00:38:30,400
You better say that that sounds to Alex Jones

797
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:35,520
Do the hundreds of thousands

798
00:38:35,776 --> 00:38:37,824
Directly responsible for a lot of

799
00:38:38,336 --> 00:38:38,848
Really f***** up

800
00:38:39,616 --> 00:38:43,200
Also indirectly responsible for

801
00:38:43,456 --> 00:38:43,968
The most

802
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:48,320
He's a really interesting dude though if you look into him

803
00:38:52,672 --> 00:38:53,440
It's hard to

804
00:38:54,208 --> 00:38:56,512
Hard to say if he understood the power he was mess

805
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:58,048
Yoda meme

806
00:38:58,304 --> 00:39:02,400
It's difficult to know if he had any conception of

807
00:39:02,656 --> 00:39:04,704
The technique that he was laying out

808
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:06,240
How much damage

809
00:39:06,496 --> 00:39:09,312
They would do to the world if you just consider advertising

810
00:39:11,872 --> 00:39:14,944
Feeling like they need to buy things they don't need

811
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,480
And it's also you know

812
00:39:16,736 --> 00:39:20,832
Saw a lot of this stuff is kind of inevitable someone would have figured this out eventually

813
00:39:21,088 --> 00:39:23,904
We live in our time

814
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:25,440
But

815
00:39:26,976 --> 00:39:28,000
Oppenheimer

816
00:39:28,512 --> 00:39:29,536
What's so wrong

817
00:39:31,584 --> 00:39:32,864
He said I am become death to

818
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:33,632
Destroyer world

819
00:39:34,656 --> 00:39:36,448
F****** bearnaise

820
00:39:36,704 --> 00:39:39,776
Is single-handedly responsible for more deaths

821
00:39:40,288 --> 00:39:41,824
Then the nuclear bomb

822
00:39:42,336 --> 00:39:43,104
Yeah probably

823
00:39:43,616 --> 00:39:45,408
The cancer is

824
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:48,736
And all the

825
00:39:48,992 --> 00:39:50,016
This is all his fault

826
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:55,392
Pictures of

827
00:39:55,648 --> 00:39:56,416
Cool women smoking

828
00:39:56,672 --> 00:39:58,464
When I was younger I want to be cool like that

829
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:01,024
Yeah well I was a big fan of

830
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:01,792
Casablanca

831
00:40:02,304 --> 00:40:03,328
Frankly I don't give a damn

832
00:40:04,608 --> 00:40:05,120
Laura movie

833
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:17,408
Forgot my rent

834
00:40:19,968 --> 00:40:22,528
Let's get back to the drum course he's going to lay out what his

835
00:40:22,784 --> 00:40:23,808
Plan B wants

836
00:40:24,064 --> 00:40:24,832
Suggest for trumpet

837
00:40:25,344 --> 00:40:27,392
It's been studied

838
00:40:27,904 --> 00:40:29,696
Follow these rules

839
00:40:30,208 --> 00:40:32,768
Now the first rule

840
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:34,048
Is that

841
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:38,144
Create

842
00:40:40,192 --> 00:40:41,472
Russian collusion

843
00:40:41,984 --> 00:40:44,032
Donald Trump

844
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,080
Numps

845
00:40:49,664 --> 00:40:51,712
Repeated statements

846
00:40:51,968 --> 00:40:54,528
Senator Feinstein

847
00:40:54,784 --> 00:40:58,112
He goes on to like name more Senators that have said

848
00:40:58,624 --> 00:41:00,160
Varying degrees of

849
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:05,280
There's no unclassified information that shows collusion

850
00:41:05,536 --> 00:41:07,072
Signature Collision

851
00:41:07,328 --> 00:41:07,840
All these

852
00:41:08,096 --> 00:41:09,120
The same time

853
00:41:09,632 --> 00:41:10,400
Did just going back to

854
00:41:10,656 --> 00:41:12,960
The analysis of their just saying what they do

855
00:41:13,984 --> 00:41:16,544
Create create

856
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:19,616
Snare you create a false reality or a map

857
00:41:19,872 --> 00:41:20,384
A meme

858
00:41:23,712 --> 00:41:25,248
I mailed mom from

859
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:31,904
Infowars all they do is they have created this false narrative that has no evidence

860
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:36,256
That's backing it up the entire idea of globalist are behind everything

861
00:41:36,512 --> 00:41:38,048
Poison you

862
00:41:38,304 --> 00:41:39,584
I've talked to doctors

863
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:42,400
I've done some research into this fluoride

864
00:41:42,656 --> 00:41:43,168
Idea

865
00:41:43,424 --> 00:41:43,936
And if

866
00:41:44,704 --> 00:41:45,728
It's murky at best

867
00:41:45,984 --> 00:41:48,288
The idea that's really terrible

868
00:41:51,872 --> 00:41:54,687
Sure their campaign has also killed

869
00:41:57,247 --> 00:42:01,087
They're saying that this Russian thing is a false reality

870
00:42:03,647 --> 00:42:04,159
With lies

871
00:42:04,671 --> 00:42:06,463
I am in the lack of Truth

872
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:07,487
Lack of proof

873
00:42:08,767 --> 00:42:10,047
Is Infowars

874
00:42:10,559 --> 00:42:11,071
Tire game

875
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:14,655
Every single thing that we can come up with that they talk about

876
00:42:14,911 --> 00:42:16,959
George Soros is a Nazi collaborator

877
00:42:20,799 --> 00:42:21,567
Of their false

878
00:42:21,823 --> 00:42:22,335
Reality

879
00:42:22,847 --> 00:42:24,383
This is external ization

880
00:42:24,639 --> 00:42:25,151
This is

881
00:42:25,407 --> 00:42:25,919
Projection

882
00:42:26,687 --> 00:42:27,455
This is insane

883
00:42:29,759 --> 00:42:30,271
So

884
00:42:30,527 --> 00:42:31,039
You can

885
00:42:31,295 --> 00:42:32,063
Schleich horses

886
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:34,367
Doesn't know that they're already doing this

887
00:42:34,879 --> 00:42:36,415
Do you really think he doesn't know

888
00:42:36,927 --> 00:42:38,975
No he absolutely knows

889
00:42:39,231 --> 00:42:41,023
You're so bad

890
00:42:42,047 --> 00:42:45,375
What would their new false reality be

891
00:42:45,631 --> 00:42:48,959
But like he knows

892
00:42:50,495 --> 00:42:51,775
Corsi is

893
00:42:52,799 --> 00:42:53,567
Smarter than Alex

894
00:42:54,335 --> 00:42:55,615
He's being a lot more

895
00:42:56,895 --> 00:42:57,407
He's

896
00:42:58,175 --> 00:43:00,991
Personally torpedo people the propaganda campaign

897
00:43:01,247 --> 00:43:03,295
Nose

898
00:43:03,551 --> 00:43:04,063
He knows

899
00:43:06,111 --> 00:43:07,135
How serious

900
00:43:09,439 --> 00:43:10,719
Right I think

901
00:43:10,975 --> 00:43:11,487
OSHA

902
00:43:11,743 --> 00:43:13,023
They're convenient

903
00:43:13,535 --> 00:43:14,047
Oh s***

904
00:43:14,303 --> 00:43:15,583
Special prosecutor

905
00:43:17,887 --> 00:43:19,935
Relationship in the FBI

906
00:43:20,191 --> 00:43:22,495
PID

907
00:43:23,007 --> 00:43:24,543
Be fair about the Avenue

908
00:43:25,055 --> 00:43:25,567
Is absurd

909
00:43:27,103 --> 00:43:27,871
I think he knows

910
00:43:28,127 --> 00:43:29,919
Either we got a pleb big guns

911
00:43:30,687 --> 00:43:31,711
And if that means

912
00:43:31,967 --> 00:43:34,783
That we have to kind of give up the game a little bit

913
00:43:35,039 --> 00:43:36,063
About what we're doing

914
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:37,599
We have to take that risk

915
00:43:37,855 --> 00:43:39,391
And hope the people who

916
00:43:39,903 --> 00:43:45,023
Do a podcast about us don't notice I think that is what's going on this is

917
00:43:45,791 --> 00:43:48,095
F****** desperation measures

918
00:43:48,351 --> 00:43:49,119
Trying

919
00:43:49,631 --> 00:43:50,911
Start a civil war

920
00:43:52,191 --> 00:43:56,799
No that's the end games that that the endgame of that propaganda

921
00:43:57,311 --> 00:44:00,895
Ways that propaganda campaign goes

922
00:44:01,407 --> 00:44:03,199
Cuz he does actually spell it out

923
00:44:04,991 --> 00:44:08,319
It's Dom

924
00:44:08,831 --> 00:44:10,879
All he wanted was to sell bananas

925
00:44:11,135 --> 00:44:15,743
Eddie cause a 30-year Civil War

926
00:44:16,767 --> 00:44:17,791
To support Trump

927
00:44:18,047 --> 00:44:19,071
Donald Trump wants

928
00:44:19,327 --> 00:44:20,863
Is tax cuts for the rich

929
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:21,887
Donald Trump

930
00:44:22,399 --> 00:44:23,679
What Trump wants

931
00:44:23,935 --> 00:44:24,959
What else

932
00:44:25,215 --> 00:44:29,567
Who wants to be the king Paul Ryan

933
00:44:30,591 --> 00:44:31,359
Call Ryan egg

934
00:44:31,615 --> 00:44:34,175
Exist but they don't support call Ryan create text

935
00:44:34,687 --> 00:44:35,967
Temple results for Paul Ryan

936
00:44:36,223 --> 00:44:42,367
Is there an arm of the right-wing propaganda

937
00:44:42,623 --> 00:44:43,903
Actually an important thing that we need to

938
00:44:44,159 --> 00:44:45,439
To clarify

939
00:44:45,951 --> 00:44:47,231
Right just in

940
00:44:47,743 --> 00:44:53,631
They're coincidentally gotten a little bit off base about and I want to clarify

941
00:44:53,887 --> 00:44:55,935
Just because the world is so fun

942
00:44:56,191 --> 00:44:56,959
F***** up now and where

943
00:44:58,751 --> 00:45:00,799
It kind of gets the point we talked a lot about

944
00:45:01,055 --> 00:45:05,919
Trump and we talked a lot about Ryan being an a****** and we can talk about Chase

945
00:45:09,503 --> 00:45:10,015
And we should

946
00:45:10,271 --> 00:45:11,807
In some fashion or another

947
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:15,647
But at the end of the day this podcast is about Infowars and Alex Jones

948
00:45:15,903 --> 00:45:16,415
Right

949
00:45:17,695 --> 00:45:19,743
They're not really Republican

950
00:45:20,255 --> 00:45:21,279
They hate Paul Ryan

951
00:45:21,535 --> 00:45:22,303
Does he takes money from

952
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:24,351
George Soros and they think he's a globe

953
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:26,655
Alex Jones to his credit

954
00:45:27,167 --> 00:45:28,447
Hated George Bush to

955
00:45:29,215 --> 00:45:29,727
So like

956
00:45:30,239 --> 00:45:31,263
He has

957
00:45:31,775 --> 00:45:32,543
Not consistent

958
00:45:32,799 --> 00:45:35,871
Not strictly Republican

959
00:45:36,639 --> 00:45:37,151
He is

960
00:45:37,663 --> 00:45:38,175
Other

961
00:45:39,711 --> 00:45:40,223
Problem

962
00:45:40,479 --> 00:45:42,015
That I want to address more

963
00:45:42,271 --> 00:45:43,295
I need this podcast

964
00:45:43,551 --> 00:45:44,063
To be about

965
00:45:45,343 --> 00:45:46,111
Look at

966
00:45:47,903 --> 00:45:49,183
We still have the problem

967
00:45:49,439 --> 00:45:50,975
We have right now

968
00:45:51,487 --> 00:45:52,511
And that is

969
00:45:54,303 --> 00:45:57,119
Is a media arm of a really dangerous movement

970
00:45:57,887 --> 00:45:59,423
Now they can call it Patriots

971
00:45:59,679 --> 00:46:04,287
They can call it we just want to bring country

972
00:46:04,543 --> 00:46:06,591
Sure not they're doing

973
00:46:06,847 --> 00:46:07,871
That's cold

974
00:46:08,383 --> 00:46:10,175
There is really dangerous

975
00:46:10,431 --> 00:46:11,711
Bigoted nationalism

976
00:46:12,479 --> 00:46:13,759
Going all over the world

977
00:46:15,551 --> 00:46:17,855
Yeah we can we can see it through

978
00:46:18,367 --> 00:46:20,671
Before Rodgers of the world can see it through the pain

979
00:46:21,183 --> 00:46:21,951
MC it in Putin

980
00:46:22,207 --> 00:46:23,231
We can see it

981
00:46:25,279 --> 00:46:25,791
Loved his

982
00:46:26,047 --> 00:46:27,583
His weird tendrils

983
00:46:28,095 --> 00:46:30,399
The rebel media

984
00:46:30,911 --> 00:46:32,447
And that's who we're against

985
00:46:33,727 --> 00:46:36,543
We're not against the Republicans even though we actually are also

986
00:46:36,799 --> 00:46:37,567
We are also a

987
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:39,615
Podcast

988
00:46:40,127 --> 00:46:40,639
That move

989
00:46:41,151 --> 00:46:41,919
Yes that's

990
00:46:42,175 --> 00:46:43,199
Really what we're worried about

991
00:46:44,735 --> 00:46:45,247
Great

992
00:46:45,759 --> 00:46:46,527
Our problem isn't it

993
00:46:47,039 --> 00:46:47,551
We're not done

994
00:46:48,063 --> 00:46:50,111
Well they're still going to put together their propaganda

995
00:46:50,879 --> 00:46:52,415
This white National

996
00:46:53,183 --> 00:46:53,695
And if

997
00:46:53,951 --> 00:46:54,719
You get rid of trump

998
00:46:54,975 --> 00:46:57,535
See this is why there's no other endgame

999
00:46:57,791 --> 00:46:58,559
To their propaganda

1000
00:46:59,071 --> 00:46:59,583
Vendetta

1001
00:47:00,095 --> 00:47:02,143
Get rid of trump

1002
00:47:02,655 --> 00:47:03,679
We get rid of

1003
00:47:05,215 --> 00:47:05,727
Hopefully

1004
00:47:06,239 --> 00:47:06,751
Then

1005
00:47:07,007 --> 00:47:08,287
What's their reaction

1006
00:47:09,055 --> 00:47:09,823
Only be

1007
00:47:10,335 --> 00:47:11,103
This is a COO

1008
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:14,943
There can be no other conclusion

1009
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:15,967
Written themselves

1010
00:47:16,223 --> 00:47:19,807
Into a corner Network and Alex is

1011
00:47:20,063 --> 00:47:23,391
On the show basically getting to the point where he's directly

1012
00:47:23,647 --> 00:47:24,159
If

1013
00:47:24,671 --> 00:47:25,695
Trump goes

1014
00:47:26,463 --> 00:47:29,023
We have almost run out of nonviolent

1015
00:47:29,279 --> 00:47:29,791
Solutions

1016
00:47:30,047 --> 00:47:31,839
And so he is gearing up for that

1017
00:47:32,095 --> 00:47:34,143
But let's deal with that another time when it's

1018
00:47:34,399 --> 00:47:35,935
The main course

1019
00:47:36,191 --> 00:47:41,311
Unable to record this podcast because

1020
00:47:41,567 --> 00:47:42,335
For now

1021
00:47:42,591 --> 00:47:45,663
That's not what course is on that's not the Tippy's on yet

1022
00:47:45,919 --> 00:47:48,223
Deal with him

1023
00:47:48,479 --> 00:47:48,991
By his word

1024
00:47:49,759 --> 00:47:51,295
So he goes on in his next Clip 2

1025
00:47:51,551 --> 00:47:53,087
Explain propaganda campaigns

1026
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:56,415
I have the nature of them and how you got to deal with

1027
00:48:11,007 --> 00:48:16,895
Circumstantial evidence

1028
00:48:23,807 --> 00:48:25,599
My information or the truth

1029
00:48:26,111 --> 00:48:28,671
That is a very important also related

1030
00:48:28,927 --> 00:48:31,999
Infowars

1031
00:48:32,255 --> 00:48:33,791
And that's what makes doing this podcast

1032
00:48:34,047 --> 00:48:34,815
Kind of a bummer

1033
00:48:35,327 --> 00:48:37,631
Because we can fully layout

1034
00:48:38,399 --> 00:48:41,471
Document be like no this is absolutely not the truth

1035
00:48:42,239 --> 00:48:46,335
Things like whiteboard

1036
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:49,919
15

1037
00:48:50,175 --> 00:48:52,991
Or even just will be played at the beginning of the episode The Comey thing

1038
00:48:53,247 --> 00:48:57,599
No I was I was hoping you were

1039
00:48:57,855 --> 00:49:00,671
Now we have to research

1040
00:49:01,183 --> 00:49:04,767
Measuring dicks

1041
00:49:05,023 --> 00:49:11,167
Bush research hey Mike, come from the screaming monkey I don't know where the truth

1042
00:49:11,423 --> 00:49:14,239
True

1043
00:49:15,263 --> 00:49:16,287
All three

1044
00:49:18,591 --> 00:49:20,895
That is the nature of trying

1045
00:49:24,479 --> 00:49:27,295
We can prove the wrong until we're blue in the face it doesn't matter

1046
00:49:30,111 --> 00:49:31,135
Is clowning on it

1047
00:49:33,439 --> 00:49:34,207
I just I just

1048
00:49:34,463 --> 00:49:36,511
I have a hard time believing that

1049
00:49:37,023 --> 00:49:38,303
I guess it's just

1050
00:49:39,071 --> 00:49:39,583
Because I

1051
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:40,607
Somehow

1052
00:49:42,399 --> 00:49:42,911
I'm kind of

1053
00:49:43,167 --> 00:49:44,191
Hope in humanity

1054
00:49:44,703 --> 00:49:47,775
Times Daily

1055
00:49:48,287 --> 00:49:48,799
If you can

1056
00:49:49,311 --> 00:49:51,359
If you confront somebody's beliefs

1057
00:49:52,127 --> 00:49:52,639
With the

1058
00:49:52,895 --> 00:49:54,943
The truth that they

1059
00:49:55,199 --> 00:49:55,711
Doesn't fit

1060
00:49:55,967 --> 00:49:56,479
Within their beliefs

1061
00:49:56,991 --> 00:49:58,783
Accepting the truth

1062
00:49:59,039 --> 00:49:59,807
And expanding

1063
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:02,879
They instead double down on the b******* that they both

1064
00:50:03,391 --> 00:50:04,927
Yeah yeah

1065
00:50:05,183 --> 00:50:05,951
That can't

1066
00:50:06,207 --> 00:50:06,719
Be everybody

1067
00:50:07,231 --> 00:50:08,511
There is a percentage of

1068
00:50:09,279 --> 00:50:10,815
Who will accept that

1069
00:50:11,583 --> 00:50:12,607
And that's what I think

1070
00:50:12,863 --> 00:50:13,631
We are going for

1071
00:50:14,399 --> 00:50:15,935
Just like just like with Trump voters

1072
00:50:17,215 --> 00:50:17,727
38

1073
00:50:17,983 --> 00:50:19,263
Percent of the

1074
00:50:19,519 --> 00:50:20,031
Polls

1075
00:50:20,543 --> 00:50:22,079
Will always be for

1076
00:50:22,847 --> 00:50:24,127
You're not going to get

1077
00:50:24,639 --> 00:50:25,407
Yeah

1078
00:50:25,919 --> 00:50:27,967
Used to be

1079
00:50:28,991 --> 00:50:29,503
A Tuesday

1080
00:50:29,759 --> 00:50:30,271
To be hired

1081
00:50:31,039 --> 00:50:32,319
So the idea is that pee

1082
00:50:32,575 --> 00:50:33,855
People are unable

1083
00:50:34,111 --> 00:50:35,391
To learn from something

1084
00:50:35,647 --> 00:50:36,159
Thing that

1085
00:50:36,415 --> 00:50:38,207
Contradicts their core beliefs

1086
00:50:38,463 --> 00:50:39,999
I can't believe is

1087
00:50:40,255 --> 00:50:41,279
Is universal

1088
00:50:46,911 --> 00:50:47,679
Over

1089
00:50:47,935 --> 00:50:48,447
Throat

1090
00:50:48,703 --> 00:50:49,215
Election

1091
00:50:49,727 --> 00:50:51,775
Like I imagined we really get just

1092
00:50:52,031 --> 00:50:52,799
5% of

1093
00:50:53,055 --> 00:50:54,079
People who voted

1094
00:50:54,335 --> 00:50:55,103
For Trump

1095
00:50:55,359 --> 00:50:56,127
Get out and vote for

1096
00:50:56,383 --> 00:50:56,895
For somebody else

1097
00:50:57,407 --> 00:50:57,919
That is

1098
00:50:58,431 --> 00:51:01,503
The presidential election overthrown

1099
00:51:01,759 --> 00:51:03,039
How many republican

1100
00:51:03,295 --> 00:51:03,807
Governor

1101
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:05,855
How many republican congressmen

1102
00:51:06,111 --> 00:51:07,135
How many of all of the

1103
00:51:07,647 --> 00:51:08,927
People go away

1104
00:51:09,183 --> 00:51:09,695
Because the

1105
00:51:09,951 --> 00:51:11,743
The margins are often times

1106
00:51:11,999 --> 00:51:13,279
Razor-thin

1107
00:51:13,535 --> 00:51:15,583
And now they are going to be even more

1108
00:51:16,095 --> 00:51:18,911
To the point where if you if the if we had a

1109
00:51:19,167 --> 00:51:19,679
Competent

1110
00:51:20,959 --> 00:51:22,239
Committed Democrat

1111
00:51:22,495 --> 00:51:23,007
Party

1112
00:51:23,263 --> 00:51:24,543
That actually was

1113
00:51:24,799 --> 00:51:25,567
A progressive

1114
00:51:26,591 --> 00:51:27,103
Progressive

1115
00:51:27,871 --> 00:51:30,175
I think there's a good chance that

1116
00:51:30,431 --> 00:51:30,943
2018

1117
00:51:31,455 --> 00:51:32,223
Baywood

1118
00:51:32,479 --> 00:51:33,503
Overwhelmingly

1119
00:51:34,015 --> 00:51:35,295
Use that same Papa

1120
00:51:35,551 --> 00:51:36,063
Heelys message

1121
00:51:36,319 --> 00:51:39,135
But in a positive way and wind up getting over

1122
00:51:40,671 --> 00:51:41,695
I mean

1123
00:51:42,975 --> 00:51:45,279
Possible

1124
00:51:45,535 --> 00:51:46,559
I could come to pass

1125
00:51:46,815 --> 00:51:52,191
I don't think that's the problem again

1126
00:51:52,447 --> 00:51:56,031
You don't have to be a computer

1127
00:51:56,287 --> 00:52:00,895
No.

1128
00:52:04,735 --> 00:52:06,271
We got plans

1129
00:52:06,527 --> 00:52:09,599
So don't get disheartened like that just Bisquick

1130
00:52:10,879 --> 00:52:11,391
The word plant

1131
00:52:14,719 --> 00:52:16,511
Plantain

1132
00:52:17,023 --> 00:52:18,047
But

1133
00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:19,327
Navigate to the next

1134
00:52:19,583 --> 00:52:21,119
Alex

1135
00:52:22,655 --> 00:52:27,007
Jerome corsi is suggesting is that they start assassinating people's character

1136
00:52:27,263 --> 00:52:28,287
Which is real fun

1137
00:52:28,543 --> 00:52:30,591
Because even Jerome corsi

1138
00:52:41,855 --> 00:52:43,903
The more facts you a deuce

1139
00:52:53,631 --> 00:52:54,143
Right

1140
00:52:54,399 --> 00:52:55,423
I like

1141
00:52:55,679 --> 00:52:59,007
This is how like interviews don't work on Infowars

1142
00:52:59,519 --> 00:53:03,615
Whenever someone who actually knows Alex Jones is doing an interview with there's like

1143
00:53:03,871 --> 00:53:10,015
Let me get my words out because you're going to get yours out

1144
00:53:10,271 --> 00:53:12,063
Unless we're both talking about how great white

1145
00:53:12,319 --> 00:53:18,463
This is going to be a non-starter

1146
00:53:18,719 --> 00:53:20,511
No matter how many more facts you produce

1147
00:53:20,767 --> 00:53:24,351
He's not going to believe it

1148
00:53:24,607 --> 00:53:29,471
Your character interesting because you might

1149
00:53:29,727 --> 00:53:31,519
F****** sued you idiot

1150
00:53:31,775 --> 00:53:35,871
Which again we have to let me to bring that up they settled that lawsuit which Alex Jones said

1151
00:53:36,383 --> 00:53:37,919
On this I will stand

1152
00:53:38,431 --> 00:53:38,943
I will win

1153
00:53:40,735 --> 00:53:41,759
Less than a month later

1154
00:53:42,527 --> 00:53:44,831
He settles the lawsuit with Chobani yogurt

1155
00:53:45,087 --> 00:53:47,135
An issue is a public apology

1156
00:53:47,391 --> 00:53:48,927
It's been a day and a half

1157
00:53:49,183 --> 00:53:53,535
Has it been on the show it hasn't been on the show I was this close to calling in

1158
00:53:53,791 --> 00:53:59,935
Maybe tomorrow maybe

1159
00:54:00,191 --> 00:54:01,215
Google say if I do

1160
00:54:01,471 --> 00:54:04,543
I can't wait to see how quick that gets cut out of every project

1161
00:54:04,799 --> 00:54:05,567
No way

1162
00:54:08,895 --> 00:54:14,271
Dude if you even said the word Chobani you being f****** hung-up on immediately

1163
00:54:15,295 --> 00:54:17,343
I'm at Alex's scream about something I don't know

1164
00:54:20,415 --> 00:54:22,207
I'm saying I apologize

1165
00:54:22,719 --> 00:54:23,743
Right weight

1166
00:54:23,999 --> 00:54:24,511
No you have

1167
00:54:25,023 --> 00:54:25,535
That can't be

1168
00:54:25,791 --> 00:54:26,559
If that's not your whole

1169
00:54:29,375 --> 00:54:35,519
Right just to call in and have like a sound machine that just plays on this I will stand

1170
00:54:37,567 --> 00:54:38,591
Tukwila

1171
00:54:40,127 --> 00:54:40,895
That that's how we

1172
00:54:41,151 --> 00:54:41,919
Close at this podcast

1173
00:54:42,431 --> 00:54:46,527
Spent it Thursday today

1174
00:54:50,367 --> 00:54:51,391
Well what happened was

1175
00:54:51,903 --> 00:54:53,183
He lost against

1176
00:54:54,207 --> 00:54:56,255
Can't afford anymore

1177
00:54:59,071 --> 00:55:01,375
Giovanni which is why we lost

1178
00:55:05,471 --> 00:55:07,519
I didn't land at all

1179
00:55:11,871 --> 00:55:15,199
DoubleDown more on the idea that fact

1180
00:55:15,711 --> 00:55:16,479
What kind of pointless

1181
00:55:16,735 --> 00:55:17,503
Against these

1182
00:55:18,015 --> 00:55:19,551
False reality meme

1183
00:55:20,063 --> 00:55:22,367
And then

1184
00:55:22,623 --> 00:55:23,647
You'll see where he takes it

1185
00:55:27,487 --> 00:55:28,767
If you take a look

1186
00:55:29,023 --> 00:55:30,303
Dealing with it

1187
00:55:35,935 --> 00:55:37,471
Part of the conspiracy theory

1188
00:55:38,495 --> 00:55:41,823
The Russian collusion story

1189
00:55:52,319 --> 00:55:53,855
Attempts to prove this

1190
00:55:54,367 --> 00:55:56,927
Boost

1191
00:56:03,839 --> 00:56:04,607
Over this company

1192
00:56:09,471 --> 00:56:11,007
Is never going to report

1193
00:56:19,967 --> 00:56:23,039
So Adam rhymes with Jean

1194
00:56:31,487 --> 00:56:32,767
He even in his book

1195
00:56:34,047 --> 00:56:36,095
Rhymes with Jean

1196
00:56:36,351 --> 00:56:42,495
That's good of him is not read

1197
00:56:43,007 --> 00:56:48,127
He also hasn't read a whole lot pushes that narrative with me

1198
00:56:49,919 --> 00:56:50,943
Interview

1199
00:56:51,199 --> 00:56:52,479
Get off track

1200
00:56:52,735 --> 00:56:54,271
Then you're going to be

1201
00:56:54,783 --> 00:56:56,831
Have a two things

1202
00:56:57,087 --> 00:56:58,367
Hillary Clinton

1203
00:56:58,623 --> 00:56:59,903
To sell the uranium to Russia

1204
00:57:00,159 --> 00:57:01,695
Conspiracy we've been over this

1205
00:57:01,951 --> 00:57:03,231
It just it's not true

1206
00:57:03,487 --> 00:57:05,535
It's absolutely.

1207
00:57:05,791 --> 00:57:09,631
There's a write-up on knowledge.com you can find if you want to get the information

1208
00:57:09,887 --> 00:57:10,399
What about that

1209
00:57:10,655 --> 00:57:13,727
This other one

1210
00:57:14,239 --> 00:57:17,823
These shares by a company name

1211
00:57:18,079 --> 00:57:18,847
Juul invest

1212
00:57:20,639 --> 00:57:21,919
I'm sorry Jule Unlimited

1213
00:57:22,943 --> 00:57:29,087
So what happened was a 2011 podesta join the board of Jewel unlimited alternative fuel company

1214
00:57:29,343 --> 00:57:30,111
Gordon Massachusetts

1215
00:57:30,623 --> 00:57:32,671
With operations in New Mexico and the Netherlands

1216
00:57:33,439 --> 00:57:37,279
A few months after podesta took on this role and a totally true bias

1217
00:57:37,535 --> 00:57:41,631
Video of Russia backed investment fund rusnano

1218
00:57:41,887 --> 00:57:43,423
Also joined Jewels board

1219
00:57:44,447 --> 00:57:48,543
There doesn't appear to be anything untoward or illegal about the fact that podesta

1220
00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:50,591
On a corporate board with a Russian Banker

1221
00:57:51,103 --> 00:57:51,615
Nevertheless

1222
00:57:52,127 --> 00:57:54,431
Some of his and Clinton critics of plaited up

1223
00:57:54,687 --> 00:57:56,735
Conservative website The Daily Caller

1224
00:57:56,991 --> 00:57:59,551
Discloses

1225
00:57:59,807 --> 00:58:01,855
What are you doing the Obama Administration in 2014

1226
00:58:02,623 --> 00:58:03,391
In any case

1227
00:58:03,903 --> 00:58:04,927
The company is American

1228
00:58:05,183 --> 00:58:05,695
Not Russian

1229
00:58:05,951 --> 00:58:08,511
That is courtesy of PolitiFact

1230
00:58:08,767 --> 00:58:09,279
That has

1231
00:58:09,535 --> 00:58:11,071
Some good resources you can check out

1232
00:58:11,327 --> 00:58:11,839
PlayStation

1233
00:58:12,351 --> 00:58:13,631
Absolute nonsense

1234
00:58:13,887 --> 00:58:15,935
This idea that Jewel Unlimited

1235
00:58:16,191 --> 00:58:17,727
There's some sort of nefarious

1236
00:58:18,751 --> 00:58:20,287
Getting money from the Russians

1237
00:58:20,543 --> 00:58:22,847
You could interpret

1238
00:58:23,103 --> 00:58:23,615
Their name

1239
00:58:23,871 --> 00:58:24,383
To be Unlimited

1240
00:58:29,759 --> 00:58:30,527
But you know what

1241
00:58:31,295 --> 00:58:32,063
Corrupts absolutely

1242
00:58:33,599 --> 00:58:34,111
Do you know who searched

1243
00:58:36,159 --> 00:58:36,671
Edgar Winter

1244
00:58:38,719 --> 00:58:40,255
He wants a high or low

1245
00:58:40,511 --> 00:58:42,047
The globalists totally

1246
00:58:42,559 --> 00:58:46,911
How do you think he felt about apps

1247
00:58:47,935 --> 00:58:48,959
Corrupts absolutely

1248
00:58:49,215 --> 00:58:49,983
I don't know

1249
00:58:50,495 --> 00:58:52,031
Depression about

00:58:52,287 --> 00:58:53,567
Degrade

1251
00:58:54,847 --> 00:58:58,687
My wrist game is off my wrist my wrist gun isn't firing right

1252
00:58:59,199 --> 00:59:01,247
Work

1253
00:59:02,015 --> 00:59:02,783
Against

1254
00:59:03,039 --> 00:59:03,551
This

1255
00:59:04,063 --> 00:59:06,111
False reality of the Russian

1256
00:59:09,951 --> 00:59:10,719
You're getting uranium

1257
00:59:10,975 --> 00:59:12,511
Podesta with this company

1258
00:59:12,767 --> 00:59:14,559
Conspiracy theorist

1259
00:59:14,815 --> 00:59:18,399
Because you're spouting bulshit that isn't reality

1260
00:59:18,655 --> 00:59:19,423
It's not going to work

1261
00:59:19,679 --> 00:59:23,007
It's not going to work against this false reality that is the Russians

1262
00:59:23,519 --> 00:59:24,031
Blackwell

1263
00:59:24,287 --> 00:59:29,151
Of course it's not going to work and the mainstream media isn't going to true

1264
00:59:29,663 --> 00:59:31,199
Peter verifiably

1265
00:59:31,455 --> 00:59:35,295
People have research them it's not blurry ignoring these things

1266
00:59:35,551 --> 00:59:40,927
If you say why isn't the Clinton sell Uranium on the front page of every paper it's because it's not true

1267
00:59:41,183 --> 00:59:41,695
People

1268
00:59:41,951 --> 00:59:43,487
Journalist had looked into it

1269
00:59:44,255 --> 00:59:45,791
It's not

1270
00:59:46,047 --> 00:59:47,071
Dumb old man

1271
00:59:47,583 --> 00:59:48,095
Anyway

1272
00:59:51,935 --> 00:59:52,447
Just because it's

1273
00:59:52,703 --> 00:59:53,215
So repetitive

1274
00:59:53,727 --> 00:59:54,239
It's just like

1275
00:59:56,799 --> 00:59:57,567
Choose a new one

1276
00:59:57,823 --> 00:59:58,591
No they can't

1277
00:59:58,847 --> 00:59:59,615
And you have to

1278
01:00:00,127 --> 01:00:00,895
Repeat it loudly

1279
01:00:01,407 --> 01:00:02,175
Because then it became

1280
01:00:02,943 --> 01:00:04,735
Bring up a false reality

1281
01:00:04,991 --> 01:00:05,759
Yeah

1282
01:00:06,783 --> 01:00:08,575
You want to make sure that

1283
01:00:08,831 --> 01:00:09,855
Even though what you're saying

1284
01:00:10,111 --> 01:00:10,623
Isn't true

1285
01:00:11,135 --> 01:00:11,647
It's a

1286
01:00:11,903 --> 01:00:13,439
Defied again

1287
01:00:13,695 --> 01:00:14,207
Echo

1288
01:00:14,975 --> 01:00:16,255
A people who are in

1289
01:00:16,511 --> 01:00:17,535
Like a herd

1290
01:00:18,047 --> 01:00:19,327
And they're easily influence

1291
01:00:19,839 --> 01:00:20,863
Buy a loud

1292
01:00:22,911 --> 01:00:23,679
Idiotic

1293
01:00:23,935 --> 01:00:26,239
Ideas of

1294
01:00:26,495 --> 01:00:28,799
People all agreeing based on

1295
01:00:29,055 --> 01:00:30,335
Social media

1296
01:00:32,895 --> 01:00:33,663
The only like

1297
01:00:34,175 --> 01:00:34,943
You have to

1298
01:00:35,199 --> 01:00:36,479
To be a full-on psychopath

1299
01:00:36,735 --> 01:00:37,247
To do this

1300
01:00:39,807 --> 01:00:42,367
What's the next clip

1301
01:00:42,879 --> 01:00:43,903
Was jumping

1302
01:00:44,159 --> 01:00:49,791
Crossword best-selling books

1303
01:00:50,303 --> 01:00:52,607
The ultimate propaganda weapon is truth

1304
01:00:52,863 --> 01:00:54,911
According to him

1305
01:00:55,167 --> 01:00:58,239
In case you haven't listened to other episodes

1306
01:00:58,495 --> 01:00:59,007
He's written

1307
01:00:59,263 --> 01:00:59,775
2 books

1308
01:01:00,287 --> 01:01:01,823
About how Obamas birth

1309
01:01:05,407 --> 01:01:08,223
A bunch of spurious

1310
01:01:10,015 --> 01:01:11,295
Provably untrue

1311
01:01:11,551 --> 01:01:15,135
Statements about his time in Vietnam

1312
01:01:15,391 --> 01:01:18,719
Not sure didn't really change the outcome

1313
01:01:19,999 --> 01:01:22,559
In the same way that in the same way that

1314
01:01:23,583 --> 01:01:24,095
Like

1315
01:01:24,351 --> 01:01:26,655
The opposite is true the most

1316
01:01:26,911 --> 01:01:28,191
Open is untrue

1317
01:01:28,703 --> 01:01:30,495
Go through it

1318
01:01:31,007 --> 01:01:32,543
So many pulls of Republicans

1319
01:01:32,799 --> 01:01:35,615
It's like 60% still don't believe that Obama

1320
01:01:36,639 --> 01:01:37,663
Quest

1321
01:01:40,223 --> 01:01:40,735
Look

1322
01:01:40,991 --> 01:01:41,503
You can ask

1323
01:01:42,015 --> 01:01:43,807
Just we're just looking for it

1324
01:01:45,599 --> 01:01:46,623
They could have faked that birds

1325
01:01:47,135 --> 01:01:49,183
He's from Hawaii that's not even real estate

1326
01:01:49,439 --> 01:01:53,279
So I will be Guatemala

1327
01:01:53,535 --> 01:01:54,047
Shut the

1328
01:01:54,303 --> 01:01:54,815
The fuk up

1329
01:01:55,071 --> 01:01:56,351
And we don't care if your people die

1330
01:01:56,607 --> 01:01:59,167
More about unfit

1331
01:01:59,423 --> 01:02:00,191
4 commands

1332
01:02:01,727 --> 01:02:02,495
Recently

1333
01:02:03,007 --> 01:02:05,055
I read this little tidbit

1339
01:02:23,231 --> 01:02:23,743
Issues

1340
01:02:24,255 --> 01:02:24,767
About it

1341
01:02:25,279 --> 01:02:26,303
So he didn't write it

1342
01:02:26,559 --> 01:02:27,071
Probably not

1343
01:02:28,607 --> 01:02:29,375
Probably not

1344
01:02:32,191 --> 01:02:32,959
It's like Tom Clancy

1345
01:02:33,215 --> 01:02:33,727
All over again

1346
01:02:37,823 --> 01:02:43,967
The theme of the book is that John Kerry's four-month tour in Vietnam have been marked by cowardice Under Fire and fraudulently a

1347
01:02:44,223 --> 01:02:44,735
Painting metal

1348
01:02:44,991 --> 01:02:48,575
In that regard the book contained statements by some Veterans of the Vietnam

1349
01:02:48,831 --> 01:02:50,623
Who starred with John Kerry on Swift boat

1350
01:02:50,879 --> 01:02:51,647
Several

1351
01:02:51,903 --> 01:02:53,695
Executed affidavit in support of their claim

1352
01:02:54,207 --> 01:02:56,767
These claims were repudiated by other veterans

1353
01:02:57,023 --> 01:03:00,351
To serve with Carrie and proven by outside sources

1354
01:03:00,607 --> 01:03:02,399
Including the Navy's official records

1355
01:03:02,655 --> 01:03:03,167
Oh boy

1356
01:03:05,471 --> 01:03:07,519
Buckhead

1357
01:03:08,031 --> 01:03:08,799
So the Ultimate Weapon is

1358
01:03:11,103 --> 01:03:12,639
Get to the next clip

1359
01:03:12,895 --> 01:03:15,199
This point this is the point where

1360
01:03:15,967 --> 01:03:16,991
Basically Kursi

1361
01:03:17,247 --> 01:03:18,783
Breaks down and advises

1362
01:03:19,039 --> 01:03:20,063
Actually start using

1363
01:03:20,319 --> 01:03:20,831
Propaganda

1364
01:03:21,599 --> 01:03:27,743
How do we deal with men total manufacturing false reality.

1365
01:03:39,007 --> 01:03:39,519
My fax

1366
01:03:40,287 --> 01:03:42,847
You're not going to Beat It by proving that it was wrong

1367
01:03:57,183 --> 01:03:59,999
Continue

1368
01:04:01,791 --> 01:04:04,607
Control

1369
01:04:05,119 --> 01:04:07,423
Capture the narrative

1370
01:04:07,679 --> 01:04:09,983
Take it out

1371
01:04:14,591 --> 01:04:18,431
So the first thing is really fun there is just like Alex does not understand what's being

1372
01:04:18,943 --> 01:04:20,223
He doesn't get it

1373
01:04:20,991 --> 01:04:27,135
Course he has to keep saying don't matter when you're up against

1374
01:04:27,391 --> 01:04:32,255
Spain facts don't matter

1375
01:04:35,071 --> 01:04:35,839
But you know what

1376
01:04:36,095 --> 01:04:37,375
You know what it is fascinating about

1377
01:04:39,423 --> 01:04:40,447
Suggested Alex

1378
01:04:41,215 --> 01:04:42,239
Is a True Believer

1379
01:04:42,751 --> 01:04:45,055
Yeah because he constantly says

1380
01:04:45,311 --> 01:04:46,847
You know the reason that were with

1381
01:04:47,359 --> 01:04:47,871
Is because we have

1382
01:04:48,895 --> 01:04:50,431
The truth the reason that is

1383
01:04:50,687 --> 01:04:51,199
Because we

1384
01:04:51,455 --> 01:04:51,967
Care about the

1385
01:04:52,223 --> 01:04:52,991
The truth we care about the

1386
01:04:55,295 --> 01:04:56,575
Like even if he does

1387
01:04:58,367 --> 01:04:58,879
Say that

1388
01:04:59,391 --> 01:05:03,231
He can't come out and support a propaganda

1389
01:05:03,999 --> 01:05:05,791
Because that destroys

1390
01:05:06,303 --> 01:05:06,815
Everything

1391
01:05:07,071 --> 01:05:09,375
Him being aware of it

1392
01:05:09,631 --> 01:05:11,167
Then this acetate him having

1393
01:05:11,423 --> 01:05:11,935
To be aware of what

1394
01:05:12,191 --> 01:05:12,959
Exactly

1395
01:05:13,215 --> 01:05:13,727
Interesting

1396
01:05:13,983 --> 01:05:16,799
And then if he's if he does become aware of that

1397
01:05:17,055 --> 01:05:18,079
He does participate in

1398
01:05:18,335 --> 01:05:18,847
In the propaganda

1399
01:05:20,127 --> 01:05:22,175
That means that either his listeners

1400
01:05:22,687 --> 01:05:23,967
Will Venable

1401
01:05:24,223 --> 01:05:25,247
The the propaganda

1402
01:05:26,015 --> 01:05:27,039
As they do right

1403
01:05:28,575 --> 01:05:29,599
But if they

1404
01:05:31,903 --> 01:05:32,415
Then what

1405
01:05:32,671 --> 01:05:34,207
What do you really believe

1406
01:05:34,463 --> 01:05:39,583
Right right really believe all the sudden the same stuff

1407
01:05:40,095 --> 01:05:41,375
They're saying now

1408
01:05:41,631 --> 01:05:43,167
But they're also telling you

1409
01:05:43,423 --> 01:05:44,447
That is true

1410
01:05:44,703 --> 01:05:45,471
And they're doing it for

1411
01:05:45,727 --> 01:05:47,263
Evil

1412
01:05:47,519 --> 01:05:48,031
Or for good

1413
01:05:48,287 --> 01:05:54,431
Perspective

1414
01:06:00,575 --> 01:06:02,111
Because otherwise yeah it does

1415
01:06:02,623 --> 01:06:03,647
It does call into question

1416
01:06:04,671 --> 01:06:06,463
What we've been listening to for 20 years

1417
01:06:06,719 --> 01:06:12,863
We'll get what can you what can you do

1418
01:06:13,119 --> 01:06:16,447
Narrative even if they say they're deliberately

1419
01:06:19,263 --> 01:06:21,055
They're still going to stay the same s***

1420
01:06:21,311 --> 01:06:23,103
So you have to dance

1421
01:06:23,359 --> 01:06:23,871
Resume

1422
01:06:24,127 --> 01:06:26,175
If you are at all

1423
01:06:26,431 --> 01:06:28,479
Conscious and self-aware

1424
01:06:28,735 --> 01:06:30,015
That then you have to

1425
01:06:30,271 --> 01:06:33,343
If you are a regular listener of Alex Jones you have to be like wait

1426
01:06:33,855 --> 01:06:35,135
This is what you said

1427
01:06:35,391 --> 01:06:35,903
2 weeks ago

1428
01:06:36,415 --> 01:06:37,695
Before you told us it was

1429
01:06:37,951 --> 01:06:38,463
Was the propaganda

1430
01:06:39,231 --> 01:06:41,023
You're saying it now

1431
01:06:41,279 --> 01:06:43,583
Campaign

1432
01:06:43,839 --> 01:06:44,351
So what was

1433
01:06:45,375 --> 01:06:47,679
Yeah but it's kind of it's kind of like his

1434
01:06:47,935 --> 01:06:49,983
Is wiser under child lock

1435
01:06:50,239 --> 01:06:51,775
You know what I mean like anyone

1436
01:06:52,031 --> 01:06:54,591
Who's smart enough to figure out how to unlock

1437
01:06:54,847 --> 01:06:55,359
The Box

1438
01:06:55,615 --> 01:06:56,127
Chose

1439
01:06:56,383 --> 01:06:58,175
3 a.m.

1440
01:06:58,431 --> 01:06:58,943
They

1441
01:06:59,199 --> 01:07:05,343
They've already unlocked box mankind of paradox

1442
01:07:05,599 --> 01:07:07,903
Kind of figure it out

1443
01:07:08,159 --> 01:07:08,671
Are going

1444
01:07:08,927 --> 01:07:09,951
Be like

1445
01:07:10,975 --> 01:07:11,487
Oh

1446
01:07:11,999 --> 01:07:16,863
Yeah that would only make them feel like they were now working on something

1447
01:07:17,119 --> 01:07:18,143
When you're stupid

1448
01:07:18,399 --> 01:07:19,423
Your boy do you love it when

1449
01:07:19,679 --> 01:07:20,191
People tell you you're

1450
01:07:20,703 --> 01:07:23,007
Yeah usually too dumb to realize you're not

1451
01:07:26,591 --> 01:07:27,359
If you will

1452
01:07:27,615 --> 01:07:29,151
Next

1453
01:07:29,407 --> 01:07:29,919
Discussion of trump

1454
01:07:30,175 --> 01:07:31,455
Has become.

1455
01:07:31,711 --> 01:07:32,223
The news

1456
01:07:36,831 --> 01:07:37,343
Then

1457
01:07:37,599 --> 01:07:40,415
Clipmaker

1458
01:07:40,671 --> 01:07:41,951
A really funny noise

1459
01:07:42,207 --> 01:07:42,975
Accidentally

1460
01:07:44,767 --> 01:07:45,791
It's real good

1461
01:07:58,591 --> 01:08:04,735
What is traffic right now

1462
01:08:14,463 --> 01:08:19,071
That the changes the narrative

1463
01:08:29,823 --> 01:08:34,943
That I have isolated just that really enjoy that

1464
01:08:41,855 --> 01:08:43,391
It's snowing bibelen

1465
01:08:44,671 --> 01:08:46,719
So I mean

1466
01:08:55,679 --> 01:09:01,823
I know it's it's kind of a clown on it for a little accidental noise

1467
01:09:02,079 --> 01:09:04,639
He's just like course he is

1468
01:09:04,895 --> 01:09:07,455
Just straight like Sweden to make that noise

1469
01:09:07,967 --> 01:09:09,503
Didgeridoo

1470
01:09:10,783 --> 01:09:11,551
David Mamet

1471
01:09:12,319 --> 01:09:16,159
Just trying to figure out how to make that pot

1472
01:09:16,671 --> 01:09:18,719
Liking it in reality with you

1473
01:09:19,231 --> 01:09:20,511
Corsi is the guesting

1474
01:09:21,535 --> 01:09:22,815
We need something

1475
01:09:23,327 --> 01:09:24,095
That will

1476
01:09:24,351 --> 01:09:26,143
Completely change the narrative

1477
01:09:26,655 --> 01:09:29,471
Whether or not it's manufactured

1478
01:09:29,983 --> 01:09:30,751
Narrative

1479
01:09:31,263 --> 01:09:32,799
A what's behind

1480
01:09:33,311 --> 01:09:34,591
Oh oh this is fake

1481
01:09:35,359 --> 01:09:36,895
And people are trying to Railroad him

1482
01:09:37,151 --> 01:09:39,455
It's a sphere sphere I believe

1483
01:09:40,735 --> 01:09:42,527
We can't stay on this narrative any longer

1484
01:09:42,783 --> 01:09:44,319
Yeah it's starting to unravel

1485
01:09:44,575 --> 01:09:46,879
Right I believe wholeheartedly that's what

1486
01:09:47,135 --> 01:09:48,671
Corsi realizes

1487
01:09:50,463 --> 01:09:50,975
We got to do some

1488
01:09:51,487 --> 01:09:52,767
Right

1489
01:09:53,279 --> 01:09:54,815
Maybe they are

1490
01:09:55,071 --> 01:09:56,863
Going to try and change the narrative

1491
01:09:57,119 --> 01:10:00,959
Because obviously they know

1492
01:10:01,215 --> 01:10:02,495
Hold on

1493
01:10:02,751 --> 01:10:05,055
Hold on has been on f****** Fox

1494
01:10:05,311 --> 01:10:06,847
News

1495
01:10:08,127 --> 01:10:10,431
Thing is real course he's going to get into it in this next clip

1496
01:10:13,759 --> 01:10:19,135
I want the article for tomorrow want to do this step-by-step so it's things been

1497
01:10:20,671 --> 01:10:25,279
When Trump

1498
01:10:26,047 --> 01:10:26,815
Everything about

1499
01:10:27,327 --> 01:10:28,095
Russia's stock

1500
01:10:30,655 --> 01:10:31,423
I do it

1501
01:10:31,679 --> 01:10:35,519
I knew

1502
01:10:39,871 --> 01:10:43,455
This is really a methodology I'm laying out the plan

1503
01:10:43,967 --> 01:10:45,247
So I read the article

1504
01:10:45,503 --> 01:10:46,271
Cuz it came out today

1505
01:10:50,367 --> 01:10:56,511
So the first thing in the article is he claims that the appointment of Robert Mueller is effectively changing

1506
01:10:57,279 --> 01:10:58,815
It's changing the story but it's not

1507
01:11:03,167 --> 01:11:03,679
If you have to pee

1508
01:11:03,935 --> 01:11:04,447
Pick somebody

1509
01:11:04,703 --> 01:11:05,471
With that kind of

1510
01:11:05,727 --> 01:11:06,495
Level of credential

1511
01:11:07,007 --> 01:11:07,519
Send

1512
01:11:08,543 --> 01:11:09,567
Interfere with his

1513
01:11:13,663 --> 01:11:16,991
Direct quotes from Jerome Court his article is not very well written

1514
01:11:19,295 --> 01:11:25,183
Wellbutrin May reach a conclusion this year there's no time limit placed on his special counsel investigation

1515
01:11:25,439 --> 01:11:28,511
Nor is there any restriction for Mueller examining whether the Democrats

1516
01:11:28,767 --> 01:11:29,535
Including Hillary

1517
01:11:30,815 --> 01:11:33,887
Were the politicians actually colluding with the Russians during the 26

1518
01:11:34,143 --> 01:11:34,655
16 campaign

1519
01:11:35,167 --> 01:11:37,727
That's a big new there is no

1520
01:11:38,239 --> 01:11:42,847
There is no there's no but there's nothing stopping him from investigating Mai Tai

1521
01:11:43,359 --> 01:11:46,431
Play by the way I mean also the drink Mai Tai

1522
01:11:46,687 --> 01:11:47,711
My Toys R Us

1523
01:11:50,527 --> 01:11:53,343
I didn't even catch that I was like wait why are you talking about this

1524
01:11:53,599 --> 01:11:56,415
You got it also the tie I'm using the belt right now

1525
01:11:56,671 --> 01:11:57,183
My belt broke

Stream media just got bushwhack

1532

Skillful

1533
01:12:19,455 --> 01:12:20,479
Who's the subject move

1534
01:12:20,735 --> 01:12:22,527
Engineered by President Trump's wife

1535
01:12:23,551 --> 01:12:24,575
True

1536
01:12:24,831 --> 01:12:26,367
Weights

1537
01:12:26,623 --> 01:12:27,135
Trump him

1538
01:12:27,391 --> 01:12:30,207
Is using the switch to Miller

1539
01:12:30,463 --> 01:12:31,487
Mueller yeah

1540
01:12:31,743 --> 01:12:33,791
As

1541
01:12:34,047 --> 01:12:38,399
Giving Trump some sort of 12 level dimensions

1542
01:12:38,655 --> 01:12:39,423
Genius

1543
01:12:39,679 --> 01:12:40,191
Right

1544
01:12:41,215 --> 01:12:41,727
No

1545
01:12:41,983 --> 01:12:42,751
Cuz cuz

1546
01:12:43,519 --> 01:12:47,615
Rosenstein viz Attorney General

1547
01:12:49,919 --> 01:12:50,943
30 minutes notice

1548
01:12:51,199 --> 01:12:54,015
Appointment

1549
01:12:54,271 --> 01:12:54,783
This was

1550
01:12:55,039 --> 01:13:01,183
Come out in that interview and said that this is ridiculous

1551
01:13:04,255 --> 01:13:07,327
Framing of a just completely absurd

1552
01:13:07,583 --> 01:13:10,143
So he goes on here's the other thing.

1553
01:13:10,655 --> 01:13:16,543
If they if the investigation Hilary of colluding with Russia

1554
01:13:16,799 --> 01:13:17,567
That would one

1555
01:13:17,823 --> 01:13:18,591
Feed the most

1556
01:13:19,103 --> 01:13:19,615
Wild

1557
01:13:20,127 --> 01:13:23,455
Out there every Night Shyamalan twist there's ever been

1558
01:13:26,527 --> 01:13:27,295
I'm for it

1559
01:13:27,551 --> 01:13:31,903
I'm fine with it too but it won't be about the uranium or the solar power company

1560
01:13:32,927 --> 01:13:37,279
They'll still Alex will still be wrong even if that's the outcome

1561
01:13:37,535 --> 01:13:38,815
Egos on imagine

1562
01:13:40,607 --> 01:13:46,751
Boner he would have on that episode super male vitality

1563
01:13:47,007 --> 01:13:49,311
Super male Vitality ever again it would just be with them

1564
01:13:49,567 --> 01:13:50,079
Never say that

1565
01:13:51,871 --> 01:13:57,503
Always need Supernova corsi's article goes on to list subways

1566
01:13:57,759 --> 01:13:58,527
But Trump

1567
01:13:59,039 --> 01:14:01,087
Can go ahead and change the narrative

1568
01:14:01,343 --> 01:14:01,855
And get people

1569
01:14:02,111 --> 01:14:04,159
Stop talking about the Russia stuff

1570
01:14:04,671 --> 01:14:06,463
First one is kind of diplomatically Base

1571
01:14:07,231 --> 01:14:08,511
Basically

1572
01:14:08,767 --> 01:14:09,791
Fix the Middle East

1573
01:14:15,167 --> 01:14:17,983
Cuz drop is about to go on his first out of Country tour

1574
01:14:18,239 --> 01:14:21,311
Around the article

1575
01:14:21,567 --> 01:14:23,871
Is it is the quote from the article

1576
01:14:24,383 --> 01:14:28,223
Beginning serious discussions in the Middle East between Israel and the Palestinian

1577
01:14:28,479 --> 01:14:30,783
Or getting Saudi Arabia to take Serious steps to

1578
01:14:31,039 --> 01:14:33,599
Control

1579
01:14:33,855 --> 01:14:37,439
As would be the articulation of a new balance of power structure in the Middle East

1580
01:14:37,695 --> 01:14:42,559
Military action in fh4 Russia agreed to contain a ram

1581
01:14:43,071 --> 01:14:47,423
None of those things are ever going to happen even remotely possible

1582
01:14:55,103 --> 01:14:56,383
To the Middle East

1583
01:14:56,639 --> 01:15:02,527
Six 1,000 make is really the Palestinians hog on camera

1584
01:15:04,575 --> 01:15:06,367
That's fine

1585
01:15:06,623 --> 01:15:07,135
That's fine

1586
01:15:09,951 --> 01:15:10,719
We agree

1587
01:15:11,231 --> 01:15:12,511
Conception

1588
01:15:13,279 --> 01:15:19,167
Good call Ken execution impossible for me too if I was like

1589
01:15:19,423 --> 01:15:21,471
President of my lifetime

1590
01:15:21,983 --> 01:15:23,519
Accidentally

1591
01:15:24,543 --> 01:15:26,335
Propaganda effort

1592
01:15:26,847 --> 01:15:28,127
Fix the Middle East

1593
01:15:28,383 --> 01:15:28,895
Yeah

1594
01:15:29,151 --> 01:15:31,455
That would be

1595
01:15:31,711 --> 01:15:35,295
Is the polar opposite of causing the Guatemalan Civil War

1596
01:15:35,807 --> 01:15:37,599
Long

1597
01:15:37,855 --> 01:15:38,879
Thousand-Year fight

1598
01:15:39,135 --> 01:15:45,279
Religion that does seem to match the world we live in

1599
01:15:47,327 --> 01:15:49,119
So his other suggestions are not as good

1600
01:15:51,423 --> 01:15:53,215
Here's the next one

1601
01:15:55,263 --> 01:15:58,591
Wieczorek

1602
01:16:00,127 --> 01:16:04,735
Members announced plans making dramatic reductions

1603
01:16:04,991 --> 01:16:08,063
Enforce downsizing agencies

1604
01:16:08,319 --> 01:16:14,463
Like the EPA or Department of Education already doing

1605
01:16:14,719 --> 01:16:17,791
Meaning and or implementing Trump's various executive orders

1606
01:16:18,047 --> 01:16:18,815
Controversy

1607
01:16:19,327 --> 01:16:22,911
President Trump will force the Deep State and the mainstream media to shift Focus

1608
01:16:23,167 --> 01:16:24,447
From the Russian collusion meme

1609
01:16:24,703 --> 01:16:26,751
To attack each Doucette

1610
01:16:27,007 --> 01:16:28,287
Takes by executive order

1611
01:16:29,055 --> 01:16:30,079
Which is basically

1612
01:16:30,335 --> 01:16:31,103
Hey hey

1613
01:16:31,359 --> 01:16:33,919
Destroy the environment and everyone schools

1614
01:16:34,175 --> 01:16:36,479
That'll distract

1615
01:16:38,015 --> 01:16:42,879
But not enough education

1616
01:16:43,135 --> 01:16:44,159
Shinto

1617
01:16:44,415 --> 01:16:45,183
So I guess I'll be fine

1618
01:16:47,487 --> 01:16:48,511
Your car's not going to pass inspection

1619
01:16:48,767 --> 01:16:49,535
All right look

1620
01:16:49,791 --> 01:16:51,071
You don't have good brakes on

1621
01:16:51,583 --> 01:16:52,351
Here's what you do

1622
01:16:52,863 --> 01:16:54,143
Blow it up

1623
01:17:00,799 --> 01:17:03,615
Destroy the country

1624
01:17:04,127 --> 01:17:04,639
Good call

1625
01:17:04,895 --> 01:17:06,687
That I was last one is the worst

1626
01:17:07,199 --> 01:17:08,479
Okay this is really bad

1627
01:17:10,015 --> 01:17:12,063
Understand

1628
01:17:12,575 --> 01:17:18,719
Consider North Korea a developing nuclear threat President Trump

1629
01:17:19,743 --> 01:17:22,047
Listen to this paragraph

1630
01:17:22,303 --> 01:17:23,583
He's going to advocate for

1631
01:17:24,607 --> 01:17:25,119
Blowing up

1632
01:17:25,375 --> 01:17:26,143
North Korea

1633
01:17:26,399 --> 01:17:32,543
When cruise missiles are flying towards North Korea military bases

1634
01:17:32,799 --> 01:17:34,847
Korea's nuclear weapons capability

1635
01:17:35,103 --> 01:17:40,991
The American public will not be able to focus on the Democratic party's efforts to bring impeachment proceedings against President Trump

1636
01:17:41,247 --> 01:17:41,759
Because

1637
01:17:42,271 --> 01:17:46,111
Suspicions he colluded with Russia to steal the election from Hillary

1638
01:17:46,367 --> 01:17:52,255
Kosolapy on fire instead of like okay

1639
01:17:52,511 --> 01:17:53,279
You can

1640
01:17:53,535 --> 01:17:54,303
Fix the Middle East

1641
01:17:54,559 --> 01:17:57,119
Right you can set your own car on fire

1642
01:17:58,399 --> 01:18:04,543
You can blow up that cop car that's about to stop you

1643
01:18:04,799 --> 01:18:06,591
Car cuz it's like it's someone else

1644
01:18:06,847 --> 01:18:07,359
Whose car

1645
01:18:09,919 --> 01:18:11,199
100 buses full of kids

1646
01:18:11,967 --> 01:18:13,247
Basically cuz it's just

1647
01:18:13,503 --> 01:18:14,527
The consequence of us

1648
01:18:14,783 --> 01:18:16,063
Attacking North Korea is

1649
01:18:16,575 --> 01:18:17,343
South Korea is

1650
01:18:17,599 --> 01:18:18,879
Phuc yea it's gone

1651
01:18:19,135 --> 01:18:21,183
Whatever differences we put in there

1652
01:18:21,439 --> 01:18:25,023
But it's not enough

1653
01:18:27,583 --> 01:18:28,351
20 miles away

1654
01:18:28,863 --> 01:18:31,935
Corsi's whole articles

1655
01:18:32,447 --> 01:18:33,215
Just full of

1656
01:18:33,727 --> 01:18:34,495
Bad ideas

1657
01:18:34,751 --> 01:18:35,263
Really bad eye

1658
01:18:35,519 --> 01:18:36,543
One of them

1659
01:18:36,799 --> 01:18:39,871
Would change the narrative completely

1660
01:18:40,127 --> 01:18:42,431
The other two will either lead

1661
01:18:42,687 --> 01:18:43,199
2

1662
01:18:44,223 --> 01:18:45,503
Horrible climate change

1663
01:18:45,759 --> 01:18:47,039
Asterisk

1664
01:18:47,551 --> 01:18:48,319
Stupid children

1665
01:18:48,575 --> 01:18:53,439
Radar country of millions of people in South Korea

1666
01:18:53,951 --> 01:18:55,487
Depending on

1667
01:18:57,791 --> 01:18:59,071
Inevitable start of a

1668
01:18:59,327 --> 01:19:01,375
Possible

1669
01:19:01,631 --> 01:19:02,655
We would get to the

1670
01:19:02,911 --> 01:19:03,423
Billion mark

1671
01:19:04,959 --> 01:19:05,983
Responsible

1672
01:19:06,239 --> 01:19:07,775
We don't know the full extent

1673
01:19:08,799 --> 01:19:09,567
North Korea's

1674
01:19:10,079 --> 01:19:10,591
Capabilities

1675
01:19:11,103 --> 01:19:12,639
We don't have good Intelligence on them

1676
01:19:12,895 --> 01:19:13,663
Because what they do

1677
01:19:15,967 --> 01:19:16,479
About security

1678
01:19:20,575 --> 01:19:22,111
Yeah it's

1679
01:19:22,367 --> 01:19:26,463
We don't really know the extent of what they've gotten

1680
01:19:26,975 --> 01:19:28,255
And we get some information

1681
01:19:28,511 --> 01:19:29,023
Oceanfront

1682
01:19:30,047 --> 01:19:31,327
Full out with the

1683
01:19:31,839 --> 01:19:34,143
So whenever they shoot missiles and they go into the water

1684
01:19:34,399 --> 01:19:34,911
Whatever

1685
01:19:35,167 --> 01:19:36,959
That doesn't mean that that's all they've got

1686
01:19:38,495 --> 01:19:39,263
True

1687
01:19:39,519 --> 01:19:41,823
Those are those are more

1688
01:19:42,079 --> 01:19:45,407
Would be like

1689
01:19:45,663 --> 01:19:49,759
Well I mean what they really ours

1690
01:19:50,271 --> 01:19:52,575
To continue presenting themselves

1691
01:19:52,831 --> 01:19:57,951
A very small if you're in Jurassic Park

1692
01:19:58,719 --> 01:20:01,791
They're the dinosaur that Puffs out its neck and Spence

1693
01:20:03,839 --> 01:20:05,119
And spit all over Newman

1694
01:20:05,887 --> 01:20:07,423
Very historically inaccurate

1695
01:20:08,703 --> 01:20:11,007
And now we're back on the

1696
01:20:11,263 --> 01:20:16,640
Hope you all have a good Friday now you're Lost Woods warrants

1697
01:20:20,480 --> 01:20:20,992
His article

1698
01:20:21,248 --> 01:20:22,016
That's the whole thing

1699
01:20:22,272 --> 01:20:24,320
There's a little

1700
01:20:24,576 --> 01:20:30,720
If me and if he just went Whole Hog on any and every idea

1701
01:20:32,256 --> 01:20:33,024
Here's what I could do

1702
01:20:33,280 --> 01:20:35,072
Bring universal healthcare

1703
01:20:35,584 --> 01:20:40,192
Hey here's what he could do make Africa part of the United States

1704
01:20:40,704 --> 01:20:43,264
Solve every problem

1705
01:20:43,776 --> 01:20:47,872
What's the weather like

1706
01:20:48,128 --> 01:20:48,896
Here's what he could do

1707
01:20:49,152 --> 01:20:50,944
Discovered unicorn

1708
01:20:51,456 --> 01:20:52,992
Yeah it's I mean it's as

1709
01:20:53,248 --> 01:20:54,784
Useful as that article

1710
01:21:00,416 --> 01:21:01,696
Assertive

1711
01:21:01,952 --> 01:21:04,000
That's kind of where I'm at as far as it goes

1712
01:21:05,024 --> 01:21:05,536
You

1713
01:21:05,792 --> 01:21:06,816
You spent the entire f

1714
01:21:07,072 --> 01:21:07,584
Episode up to this

1715
01:21:08,096 --> 01:21:08,864
I just waiting for that

1716
01:21:09,120 --> 01:21:10,400
On the Fly

1717
01:21:10,656 --> 01:21:12,704
What was on the floor

1718
01:21:15,264 --> 01:21:15,776
I don't

1719
01:21:16,032 --> 01:21:17,056
I don't suppose your battery

1720
01:21:17,568 --> 01:21:19,872
Meet

1721
01:21:20,128 --> 01:21:20,640
Clip

1722
01:21:20,896 --> 01:21:23,200
It just feels like Alex doesn't have

1723
01:21:24,224 --> 01:21:26,784
Music I know I invited you on my show

1724
01:21:27,296 --> 01:21:28,576
Cernovich is on hold

1725
01:21:28,832 --> 01:21:29,856
We have fun

1726
01:21:30,112 --> 01:21:32,928
Horsey you're a bummer

1727
01:21:33,440 --> 01:21:34,464
Kilbourne is s***

1728
01:21:34,720 --> 01:21:35,744
Even boars hours

1729
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:39,072
It's clearly it just feels like he's like

1730
01:21:39,328 --> 01:21:40,608
I want to hang up on you

1731
01:21:41,120 --> 01:21:41,632
Wish

1732
01:21:41,888 --> 01:21:43,168
I wish I could hang up on

1733
01:21:44,448 --> 01:21:47,008
Business has been proven state department is done

1734
01:21:47,264 --> 01:21:49,824
Is it proven by the experts to the CIA

1735
01:21:50,080 --> 01:21:52,640
I studied it for 30-40 years

1736
01:21:55,968 --> 01:21:57,248
Depressed

1737
01:21:58,272 --> 01:22:00,320
It sometime to reorganize the government

1738
01:22:00,832 --> 01:22:06,976
And take control over sometime tomorrow

1739
01:22:07,488 --> 01:22:10,560
Leave me alone

1740
01:22:14,144 --> 01:22:14,656
Forget it

1741
01:22:14,912 --> 01:22:17,216
You're torturing me it gets worse

1742
01:22:17,472 --> 01:22:19,520
What make you had of a bureau

1743
01:22:22,336 --> 01:22:23,872
It's important

1744
01:22:24,384 --> 01:22:26,688
The purpose of this

1745
01:22:30,784 --> 01:22:32,064
Is a deep state

1746
01:22:34,624 --> 01:22:38,208
Hitler

1747
01:22:44,096 --> 01:22:44,608
Eugenics

1748
01:22:46,656 --> 01:22:48,704
But that like if you made into a

1749
01:22:49,216 --> 01:22:52,544
Cosmology

1750
01:22:56,640 --> 01:22:59,712
That's the Gamble

1751
01:22:59,968 --> 01:23:00,480
That lie

1752
01:23:00,736 --> 01:23:05,856
Is advocating like here's what we need

1753
01:23:06,624 --> 01:23:07,904
Creates

1754
01:23:08,928 --> 01:23:09,952
That gets out of Arkham

1755
01:23:10,208 --> 01:23:10,720
Control

1756
01:23:10,976 --> 01:23:11,488
And causes a

1757
01:23:17,376 --> 01:23:19,936
He's doing is playing

1758
01:23:20,448 --> 01:23:22,496
This argument is being put forth

1759
01:23:22,752 --> 01:23:24,544
Trump is involved with the Russian

1760
01:23:25,056 --> 01:23:26,592
Is on par

1761
01:23:26,848 --> 01:23:28,128
With demonizing the Jews

1762
01:23:30,688 --> 01:23:31,712
I believe so

1763
01:23:34,016 --> 01:23:36,832
Okay I'm going back and give a new at-bat

1764
01:23:39,136 --> 01:23:40,160
If using the same

1765
01:23:41,952 --> 01:23:42,464
Right

1766
01:23:42,720 --> 01:23:43,232
Which

1767
01:23:44,256 --> 01:23:45,536
I don't know if that's fair

1768
01:23:46,048 --> 01:23:46,560
Doesn't

1769
01:23:47,840 --> 01:23:50,912
So whatever I listen to

1770
01:23:55,008 --> 01:23:56,032
Play on audio

1771
01:23:56,288 --> 01:23:57,568
But you could just be in Alex's face

1772
01:23:57,824 --> 01:24:01,920
He was

1773
01:24:02,432 --> 01:24:03,456
Grateful

1774
01:24:06,784 --> 01:24:08,576
Not so the more I listen

1775
01:24:08,832 --> 01:24:10,112
Listen to the more I listen to

1776
01:24:11,136 --> 01:24:12,672
The more of that idea of

1777
01:24:13,184 --> 01:24:13,696
Competing property

1778
01:24:14,976 --> 01:24:15,744
Doesn't act

1779
01:24:18,048 --> 01:24:19,328
At least

1780
01:24:20,096 --> 01:24:21,120
Because

1781
01:24:21,376 --> 01:24:23,168
We're we're using those same

1782
01:24:24,448 --> 01:24:26,240
Like his show is

1783
01:24:26,496 --> 01:24:28,800
Yeah his show is wildly entertaining

1784
01:24:29,312 --> 01:24:30,336
If you are into that

1785
01:24:31,360 --> 01:24:33,408
It's

1786
01:24:33,664 --> 01:24:36,480
It's a consistent

1787
01:24:36,736 --> 01:24:38,016
Spelling of narrative

1788
01:24:38,272 --> 01:24:40,320
As as if you were to bunking

1789
01:24:41,088 --> 01:24:43,136
Constantly his idea is

1790
01:24:43,648 --> 01:24:45,696
They're spinning the false narrative so I'm going

1791
01:24:45,952 --> 01:24:48,256
With my wild outlandish

1792
01:24:49,792 --> 01:24:51,072
Just repeat them over and over again

1793
01:24:51,328 --> 01:24:53,888
What we're trying to do

1794
01:24:54,144 --> 01:24:55,168
Is create

1795
01:24:55,424 --> 01:24:55,936
Bu

1796
01:24:56,192 --> 01:24:56,960
Same effect

1797
01:24:57,216 --> 01:25:02,592
Tube that propaganda disagree we're creating a real real

1798
01:25:02,848 --> 01:25:04,128
Disagree

1799
01:25:04,384 --> 01:25:10,528
Disagree to creating a false reality we are creating a real reality like that is playing into this

1800
01:25:11,040 --> 01:25:14,368
I disagree with that I just want to have

1801
01:25:14,624 --> 01:25:16,160
Spun

1802
01:25:16,416 --> 01:25:21,792
AutoZone have a good time

1803
01:25:22,048 --> 01:25:28,192
I'll have fun

1804
01:25:29,216 --> 01:25:30,240
Oarfish

1805
01:25:32,288 --> 01:25:34,592
I disagree with that because

1806
01:25:34,848 --> 01:25:35,360
To create

1807
01:25:35,616 --> 01:25:36,128
Any reality

1808
01:25:36,384 --> 01:25:37,152
I'm not

1809
01:25:37,408 --> 01:25:37,920
Even

1810
01:25:38,176 --> 01:25:39,200
Necessarily

1811
01:25:39,712 --> 01:25:40,224
Defend

1812
01:25:40,480 --> 01:25:40,992
Someone else

1813
01:25:41,248 --> 01:25:42,016
His version of reality

1814
01:25:42,528 --> 01:25:45,088
Lake

1815
01:25:45,600 --> 01:25:48,160
What if we have listeners who are conservatives

1816
01:25:48,416 --> 01:25:49,184
I don't give a s***

1817
01:25:49,696 --> 01:25:50,208
Believer

1818
01:25:51,232 --> 01:25:53,024
Breadwinners who were Libertarians

1819
01:25:54,304 --> 01:25:55,072
Some of your ideas

1820
01:25:55,328 --> 01:25:56,608
Go ahead

1821
01:25:56,864 --> 01:25:57,376
Whatever

1822
01:25:57,632 --> 01:25:59,936
I don't I don't care about building people's reality

1823
01:26:02,240 --> 01:26:02,752
I believe

1824
01:26:03,008 --> 01:26:04,032
F****** stupid s***

1825
01:26:04,288 --> 01:26:05,312
I kind of believe in Atlanta

1826
01:26:06,080 --> 01:26:12,224
I don't care if I understand pink makes good music

1827
01:26:12,480 --> 01:26:18,624
You understand like all I all I'm interested in as much as the show

1828
01:26:18,880 --> 01:26:20,416
Propaganda campaign

1829
01:26:20,928 --> 01:26:26,304
I hate Alex Jones and I hate the movement

1830
01:26:27,328 --> 01:26:28,096
I mean that

1831
01:26:28,608 --> 01:26:30,912
It is it does seem to me that the

1832
01:26:31,168 --> 01:26:31,936
The main weight

1833
01:26:32,192 --> 01:26:32,704
To fight against

1834
01:26:33,216 --> 01:26:33,728
Is by

1835
01:26:34,496 --> 01:26:35,008
Making some

1836
01:26:35,264 --> 01:26:36,800
Something that is as entertaining

1837
01:26:37,056 --> 01:26:38,336
Now you sound like horsey

1838
01:26:38,592 --> 01:26:39,104
Just fact

1839
01:26:43,200 --> 01:26:43,712
Damn

1840
01:26:43,968 --> 01:26:45,504
Witch Hunters

1841
01:26:48,064 --> 01:26:49,344
Split right now my dick is

1842
01:26:54,976 --> 01:26:58,816
So this next clip again just whatever you saying

1843
01:26:59,072 --> 01:27:01,376
I feel about Infowars

1844
01:27:02,656 --> 01:27:03,680
It's interesting because

1845
01:27:03,936 --> 01:27:04,960
They fully

1846
01:27:05,216 --> 01:27:07,520
Describe what it would be like to argue with them

1847
01:27:12,384 --> 01:27:16,224
First of all you're not going to defeat this false

1848
01:27:16,736 --> 01:27:18,272
Untrue

1849
01:27:18,528 --> 01:27:19,552
It's killing me

1850
01:27:19,808 --> 01:27:25,952
It just reinforces

1851
01:27:32,096 --> 01:27:37,216
And that's right around

1852
01:27:37,728 --> 01:27:40,032
Work Remix

1853
01:27:44,384 --> 01:27:46,688
That's pretty much what you do

1854
01:27:48,992 --> 01:27:49,760
Like whiskey

1855
01:27:50,016 --> 01:27:51,040
2. and not getting

1856
01:27:53,856 --> 01:27:54,880
Projecting really hard

1857
01:27:55,136 --> 01:27:57,696
Yeah cuz he's like once we start arguing we lose

1858
01:27:58,208 --> 01:27:59,232
And then Alex

1859
01:27:59,488 --> 01:28:01,536
Yeah we argue all the time

1860
01:28:01,792 --> 01:28:03,840
Yeah every lose

1861
01:28:06,656 --> 01:28:08,192
So it's it's

1862
01:28:08,448 --> 01:28:10,496
This is more revealing about Alex

1863
01:28:10,752 --> 01:28:12,032
Is idea of how

1864
01:28:12,544 --> 01:28:13,312
How to

1865
01:28:13,824 --> 01:28:14,336
Fight against

1866
01:28:15,104 --> 01:28:16,896
Then Coursey Coursey is trying to

1867
01:28:17,152 --> 01:28:22,784
To pull this kind of course

1868
01:28:23,040 --> 01:28:24,320
Is Gold's Gym

1869
01:28:26,112 --> 01:28:26,624
Call people

1870
01:28:27,648 --> 01:28:28,928
He just wants to

1871
01:28:29,184 --> 01:28:33,792
You just want to have fun he's like the damn freezing of

1872
01:28:35,328 --> 01:28:36,864
Ministry were both the boss

1873
01:28:37,376 --> 01:28:39,936
I don't know about that

1874
01:28:43,008 --> 01:28:45,824
My McAdoo

1875
01:28:46,336 --> 01:28:49,152
Now we're getting into the sexual tension

1876
01:28:49,408 --> 01:28:50,944
That's what we really want

1877
01:28:51,456 --> 01:28:52,224
So this

1878
01:28:52,480 --> 01:28:53,248
Next clip

1879
01:28:53,504 --> 01:28:56,576
Course he gives a little bit of a preview.

1880
01:28:57,088 --> 01:28:59,648
Bye and I spelled out already

1881
01:28:59,904 --> 01:29:00,928
Came out was about until

1882
01:29:01,440 --> 01:29:01,952
Kind of touches on

1883
01:29:02,464 --> 01:29:02,976
Stuff a little bit

1884
01:29:10,400 --> 01:29:11,680
Steps

1885
01:29:11,936 --> 01:29:13,728
Which would change the subject

1886
01:29:14,240 --> 01:29:17,056
And you got one coming

1887
01:29:17,312 --> 01:29:23,456
Was going to be a major Foreign Traffic

1888
01:29:31,136 --> 01:29:32,672
Buckeye cut too early

1889
01:29:32,928 --> 01:29:33,696
Owen Shroyer

1890
01:29:33,952 --> 01:29:40,096
Been sitting there

1891
01:29:40,352 --> 01:29:43,168
I was almost like he was going to say like maybe because

1892
01:29:43,424 --> 01:29:47,520
Obama got rid of

1893
01:29:50,336 --> 01:29:51,616
I mean they are probably

1894
01:29:54,432 --> 01:29:57,760
The preview theories didn't really let him talk with

1895
01:29:58,016 --> 01:29:59,040
Not interested in his

1896
01:29:59,296 --> 01:30:02,624
Get on to talk about how the media

1897
01:30:02,880 --> 01:30:03,648
The story

1898
01:30:05,696 --> 01:30:06,720
And that

1899
01:30:08,256 --> 01:30:10,560
Once he suddenly got in 5060 days

1900
01:30:10,816 --> 01:30:12,864
Then suddenly he stopped leaving

1901
01:30:33,088 --> 01:30:34,112
With the propaganda

1902
01:30:34,624 --> 01:30:35,648
You're not going to win on that

1903
01:30:36,160 --> 01:30:38,976
They're going to win

1904
01:30:44,096 --> 01:30:45,120
Is a complete lie

1905
01:30:45,376 --> 01:30:47,424
Is total propaganda

1906
01:30:49,984 --> 01:30:55,360
Fear of argument that the Russian collusion argument fits into

1907
01:30:55,616 --> 01:30:57,152
You can't beat it with facts

1908
01:30:57,920 --> 01:31:00,480
Nope I mean he's he's absolutely right

1909
01:31:01,504 --> 01:31:02,272
You can't beat it with facts

1910
01:31:02,784 --> 01:31:03,552
Could you don't

1911
01:31:03,808 --> 01:31:04,576
You don't have any

1912
01:31:04,832 --> 01:31:06,880
Sfax

1913
01:31:07,392 --> 01:31:07,904
With facts

1914
01:31:08,416 --> 01:31:09,184
The facts are not on your

1915
01:31:09,440 --> 01:31:11,488
Super unfair rhetorically

1916
01:31:11,744 --> 01:31:12,256
To be like

1917
01:31:12,512 --> 01:31:13,024
The Who

1918
01:31:13,280 --> 01:31:16,096
Like trying to kill millions of Jews

1919
01:31:17,632 --> 01:31:18,400
You're shaking your head

1920
01:31:21,984 --> 01:31:23,520
Giving 44,000

1921
01:31:23,776 --> 01:31:24,800
Email

1922
01:31:25,568 --> 01:31:27,360
I want it I want to talk about this a little bit

1923
01:31:27,872 --> 01:31:30,688
We talked about this the other day

1924
01:31:30,944 --> 01:31:31,712
Emails then

1925
01:31:31,968 --> 01:31:32,480
People who will

1926
01:31:35,296 --> 01:31:37,344
Only 144,000 are going to get home

1927
01:31:38,624 --> 01:31:42,208
Exactly what I wanted to go so

1928
01:31:42,720 --> 01:31:46,048
Seth Rich was DNC staffer who got murdered

1929
01:31:47,840 --> 01:31:48,352
Late night

1930
01:31:48,608 --> 01:31:49,120
The one

1931
01:31:50,144 --> 01:31:51,424
Home Fox News

1932
01:31:52,704 --> 01:31:53,728
F*** everything up yet again

1933
01:31:53,984 --> 01:31:57,056
We're going to get into that back in the day

1934
01:31:57,824 --> 01:32:01,920
What month back when the murder actually happened

1935
01:32:02,176 --> 01:32:03,712
Black conservative

1936
01:32:03,968 --> 01:32:05,760
Conspiracy message boards

1937
01:32:06,016 --> 01:32:08,576
And a lot of people were using the murder as

1938
01:32:10,368 --> 01:32:11,136
Conspiracy theory

1939
01:32:11,648 --> 01:32:14,208
They were saying because

1940
01:32:14,464 --> 01:32:15,488
Stumbled into evidence

1941
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:17,024
That the Russians

1942
01:32:17,536 --> 01:32:18,304
Working in

1943
01:32:18,560 --> 01:32:23,168
20 conspiracy

1944
01:32:23,680 --> 01:32:24,960
Then got repurposed

1945
01:32:26,240 --> 01:32:27,264
He was the one who is

1946
01:32:27,520 --> 01:32:29,056
Leaking emails WikiLeaks

1947
01:32:29,312 --> 01:32:30,080
Stolen the podesta

1948
01:32:30,336 --> 01:32:31,616
The emails and what have you

1949
01:32:31,872 --> 01:32:32,896
And

1950
01:32:33,152 --> 01:32:34,944
Even Julian Assange

1951
01:32:35,200 --> 01:32:35,712
Hinted

1952
01:32:36,224 --> 01:32:37,248
He is the source

1953
01:32:37,760 --> 01:32:39,296
But it never said that he

1954
01:32:39,552 --> 01:32:40,576
Because he wasn't

1955
01:32:40,832 --> 01:32:43,392
But Julian Assange is

1956
01:32:43,648 --> 01:32:44,160
Committing a

1957
01:32:44,416 --> 01:32:46,720
The propaganda by going out and saying

1958
01:32:47,744 --> 01:32:53,888
And we never divulge our sources because sometimes they get murdered on the streets where I was sort of like little

1959
01:32:54,400 --> 01:32:55,168
Little turtles

1960
01:32:55,424 --> 01:32:56,704
So now recent

1961
01:32:56,960 --> 01:32:57,728
Couple days back

1962
01:32:58,496 --> 01:32:59,776
Fox News got into the game

1963
01:33:00,032 --> 01:33:04,896
It took that conspiracy theory that it already existed in the nether regions of the internet

1964
01:33:05,152 --> 01:33:06,176
Animated main screen

1965
01:33:06,432 --> 01:33:08,224
Pushing it really hard

1966
01:33:08,480 --> 01:33:10,272
When they had a guy named a Rottweiler

1967
01:33:10,784 --> 01:33:12,064
Be on Fox News

1968
01:33:13,088 --> 01:33:15,904
He was a private message

1969
01:33:16,160 --> 01:33:17,184
The gator that's how they built

1970
01:33:17,952 --> 01:33:20,768
But the reality is is he's a Fox News contributor

1971
01:33:21,536 --> 01:33:22,816
He's also sucks

1972
01:33:23,328 --> 01:33:29,472
Also moonlights as a private investigator but they

1973
01:33:29,728 --> 01:33:31,008
That he was the family

1974
01:33:31,264 --> 01:33:31,776
He's private

1975
01:33:32,544 --> 01:33:33,056
That was

1976
01:33:33,312 --> 01:33:33,824
Not

1977
01:33:37,408 --> 01:33:39,712
Bulshit to investigate

1978
01:33:39,968 --> 01:33:43,808
I don't remember I'm not sure that it's all that important

1979
01:33:46,368 --> 01:33:47,648
But I

1980
01:33:47,904 --> 01:33:49,184
Set up any red flags

1981
01:33:49,696 --> 01:33:50,720
I did see the name

1982
01:33:51,232 --> 01:33:54,304
Cuz it's secondary to what the main story

1983
01:33:54,560 --> 01:33:55,840
And that is what he went on

1984
01:33:56,096 --> 01:33:56,608
Fox

1985
01:33:58,144 --> 01:33:58,912
And I quote

1986
01:33:59,168 --> 01:34:03,264
My investigation up to this point shows that there's some degree of email exchange

1987
01:34:03,520 --> 01:34:04,544
Between separation Wiki

1988
01:34:05,312 --> 01:34:06,848
I do believe

1989
01:34:07,104 --> 01:34:09,152
The answers to who murdered Seth rich

1990
01:34:09,408 --> 01:34:10,176
Sits on his

1991
01:34:10,432 --> 01:34:11,200
Computer on a Shelf

1992
01:34:11,712 --> 01:34:13,760
The DC police or FBI headquarters

1993
01:34:14,528 --> 01:34:15,040
However

1994
01:34:15,808 --> 01:34:16,320
Anna Stubbs

1995
01:34:18,368 --> 01:34:19,648
Rod wheeler said

1996
01:34:19,904 --> 01:34:22,464
He had no personal knowledge of riches email

1997
01:34:22,976 --> 01:34:23,488
And I quote

1998
01:34:23,744 --> 01:34:25,792
I don't even know where the computers are

1999
01:34:26,048 --> 01:34:29,120
He went on to say that he got the information

2000
01:34:29,376 --> 01:34:32,192
Interview from a Fox news reporter

2001
01:34:32,704 --> 01:34:33,472
Jesus f***

2002
01:34:33,984 --> 01:34:34,752
He was

2003
01:34:35,008 --> 01:34:37,824
Just repeating stuff that he was told on

2004
01:34:38,080 --> 01:34:41,920
He's just fed that s*** here's what we want you to say you're on Fox News

2005
01:34:42,176 --> 01:34:43,456
You're going to say what we tell you to

2006
01:34:43,712 --> 01:34:45,760
If you ever want to come back on

2007
01:34:46,016 --> 01:34:46,784
TV again

2008
01:34:47,040 --> 01:34:48,064
You say what we tell you to

2009
01:34:52,928 --> 01:34:53,696
And they put

2010
01:34:53,952 --> 01:34:54,720
Vista

2011
01:34:55,488 --> 01:34:58,560
Year of unsubstantiated claims

2012
01:34:59,072 --> 01:34:59,584
Do you know facts

2013
01:34:59,840 --> 01:35:01,120
We see no evidence

2014
01:35:01,376 --> 01:35:05,728
We've been approached with no emails and only learned about this when contacted by the Press

2015
01:35:06,240 --> 01:35:08,032
We Are Family

2016
01:35:08,288 --> 01:35:09,312
Not fake evidence

2017
01:35:09,568 --> 01:35:11,616
The surfaces every few months to fill the void

2018
01:35:11,872 --> 01:35:14,176
And distract lawn forcement and the General Public

2019
01:35:14,432 --> 01:35:15,456
I'm finding stuff murderer

2020
01:35:16,736 --> 01:35:19,552
Now Dustin sternbeck the Chiefs books

2021
01:35:19,808 --> 01:35:21,088
Coming for the DC police

2022
01:35:22,368 --> 01:35:22,880
Force

2023
01:35:23,136 --> 01:35:23,648
Set this

2024
01:35:24,160 --> 01:35:28,000
Quote there is nothing we can find that any of this is accurate

2025
01:35:28,256 --> 01:35:29,024
Sad Dustin

2026
01:35:30,048 --> 01:35:30,560
Spokesman

2027
01:35:30,816 --> 01:35:33,376
Which is leading the investigation into Richard's death

2028
01:35:33,888 --> 01:35:35,424
He would refuse to be more specific

2029
01:35:36,192 --> 01:35:36,960
FBI spokesman

2030
01:35:38,240 --> 01:35:40,032
Think the agency is not

2031
01:35:40,288 --> 01:35:41,056
And referred questions

2032
01:35:41,312 --> 01:35:41,824
DC police

2033
01:35:42,592 --> 01:35:43,872
Law enforcement officials have said that

2034
01:35:45,408 --> 01:35:47,968
Computer email activity

2035
01:35:48,224 --> 01:35:48,736
And nothing

2036
01:35:48,992 --> 01:35:50,528
Suggest that we connected

2037
01:35:51,040 --> 01:35:52,832
Which

2038
01:35:53,088 --> 01:35:55,392
Publish 20000 emails that embarrassed

2039
01:35:55,648 --> 01:35:56,672
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton

2040
01:35:56,928 --> 01:35:59,488
Have the DNC and force the ouster of

2041
01:36:01,024 --> 01:36:03,072
So

2042
01:36:03,328 --> 01:36:09,472
They look he was involved in any way the thing that ever

2043
01:36:09,728 --> 01:36:10,496
Narrative

2044
01:36:10,752 --> 01:36:13,312
Who is that he was murdered

2045
01:36:13,568 --> 01:36:14,848
In what appeared to be a

2046
01:36:15,104 --> 01:36:16,128
Street confrontation

2047
01:36:16,384 --> 01:36:17,408
In the middle of the night

2048
01:36:17,664 --> 01:36:18,432
But he wasn't wrong

2049
01:36:19,200 --> 01:36:20,736
And the reason that that

2050
01:36:21,504 --> 01:36:22,784
I mean that's weird

2051
01:36:23,040 --> 01:36:28,928
It's not that weird is if you're in the middle of a robbery and it goes bad and you accidentally kill somebody

2052
01:36:29,184 --> 01:36:30,208
You're not going to vent aches

2053
01:36:31,232 --> 01:36:32,000
You're going to just leave

2054
01:36:32,256 --> 01:36:33,024
You're going to least

2055
01:36:34,816 --> 01:36:36,096
Run

2056
01:36:36,352 --> 01:36:38,400
Especially if you're not

2057
01:36:38,912 --> 01:36:41,216
A hardened murderer conspiracy

2058
01:36:41,728 --> 01:36:44,032
Jerome corsi killed

2059
01:36:44,288 --> 01:36:49,152
Don't do that

2060
01:36:49,664 --> 01:36:52,736
Bringing up complete horseshit

2061
01:36:54,528 --> 01:36:55,296
Evidence of

2062
01:36:56,064 --> 01:36:57,088
Whatever

2063
01:36:57,344 --> 01:36:58,368
No this is Vince Foster

2064
01:36:58,624 --> 01:37:01,440
Yeah absolutely absolutely

2065
01:37:01,696 --> 01:37:04,000
It is suspicious that he died

2066
01:37:04,512 --> 01:37:06,048
It's okay

2067
01:37:09,376 --> 01:37:10,400
So you should investigate

2068
01:37:11,424 --> 01:37:12,704
And when you investigated

2069
01:37:12,960 --> 01:37:19,104
You should find only what you want to fight

2070
01:37:19,360 --> 01:37:21,920
30 years in

2071
01:37:22,176 --> 01:37:23,200
They haven't

2072
01:37:23,456 --> 01:37:24,992
F****** around with Hillary Clinton

2073
01:37:25,248 --> 01:37:26,016
When they got to

2074
01:37:26,272 --> 01:37:27,552
He was going to blow the whistle

2075
01:37:28,320 --> 01:37:29,088
My aunt still thing

2076
01:37:29,344 --> 01:37:30,112
That's why

2077
01:37:31,648 --> 01:37:32,416
Smartflow

2078
01:37:32,672 --> 01:37:33,440
It's wife

2079
01:37:37,024 --> 01:37:38,048
Describe there is f******

2080
01:37:40,608 --> 01:37:42,656
Drug

2081
01:37:42,912 --> 01:37:43,424
Crimes or anything

2082
01:37:43,680 --> 01:37:44,448
Chirp

2083
01:37:44,704 --> 01:37:45,216
Just like

2084
01:37:45,472 --> 01:37:47,264
Yeah we have evidence about it

2085
01:37:47,520 --> 01:37:49,056
If you're going to take a plea deal even though you're not

2086
01:37:51,360 --> 01:37:52,896
Because because

2087
01:37:53,152 --> 01:37:55,200
You know we don't know everything

2088
01:37:55,712 --> 01:38:00,576
I can't sit here and tell you with a hundred percent certainty that reached

2089
01:38:00,832 --> 01:38:01,856
But I can save it

2090
01:38:02,368 --> 01:38:03,392
Every piece of

2091
01:38:03,648 --> 01:38:04,672
Conformable

2092
01:38:06,464 --> 01:38:08,512
So I'm inclined to believe that

2093
01:38:09,024 --> 01:38:09,536
And

2094
01:38:10,304 --> 01:38:10,816
Hymen

2095
01:38:11,072 --> 01:38:12,864
Inclined to believe that those left-leaning

2096
01:38:13,120 --> 01:38:14,144
Conspiracy theorist

2097
01:38:14,400 --> 01:38:17,216
For disrespecting his death when they were making that argument

2098
01:38:17,472 --> 01:38:21,824
Absolutely

2099
01:38:22,080 --> 01:38:22,592
Disgrace

2100
01:38:23,360 --> 01:38:24,128
They're horrible

2101
01:38:26,688 --> 01:38:27,712
Sickens me

2102
01:38:28,992 --> 01:38:29,504
I mean

2103
01:38:29,760 --> 01:38:30,272
Just wanted to

2104
01:38:30,528 --> 01:38:32,064
Propaganda baby

2105
01:38:32,320 --> 01:38:33,344
Really is it is

2106
01:38:33,600 --> 01:38:35,648
It's such a weird coincidence that it happened

2107
01:38:35,904 --> 01:38:37,184
That it happened

2108
01:38:37,440 --> 01:38:40,000
Now and then

2109
01:38:40,256 --> 01:38:46,400
Or what they are officially now that we have this guy another we have this this

2110
01:38:46,656 --> 01:38:47,424
Russian

2111
01:38:47,680 --> 01:38:48,192
Going on

2112
01:38:48,448 --> 01:38:50,496
Which a lot of it will turn out to be

2113
01:38:50,752 --> 01:38:51,264
True

2114
01:38:51,520 --> 01:38:54,336
But there is still that kind of red fear that

2115
01:38:54,592 --> 01:38:55,360
It's still been hanging around

2116
01:38:55,872 --> 01:38:59,200
The Cold War of course if we're investigating a Russian

2117
01:38:59,456 --> 01:38:59,968
Thai

2118
01:39:00,224 --> 01:39:00,736
And somebody

2119
01:39:01,248 --> 01:39:02,784
Tertiary involved

2120
01:39:03,040 --> 01:39:03,552
Dies

2121
01:39:04,064 --> 01:39:05,856
Then you're going to get there

2122
01:39:06,112 --> 01:39:06,624
If you want to

2123
01:39:08,416 --> 01:39:09,952
Connection even if there's no evidence

2124
01:39:10,208 --> 01:39:11,232
Even if there's no point

2125
01:39:11,488 --> 01:39:12,768
You're just going to eat your brain is just

2126
01:39:13,024 --> 01:39:17,376
Go there especially if you have propaganda

2127
01:39:19,936 --> 01:39:22,240
Siri on Julian Assange

2128
01:39:22,496 --> 01:39:23,008
Is

2129
01:39:23,264 --> 01:39:24,032
I don't think

2130
01:39:24,288 --> 01:39:24,800
He started out

2131
01:39:25,056 --> 01:39:26,080
As the evil prep

2132
01:39:26,848 --> 01:39:27,360
No

2133
01:39:27,616 --> 01:39:29,152
She started out as the holy war

2134
01:39:30,432 --> 01:39:31,712
He started out as

2135
01:39:31,968 --> 01:39:32,480
Is this like

2136
01:39:32,736 --> 01:39:33,504
I want to do good

2137
01:39:33,760 --> 01:39:36,064
For the world that's why Chelsea Manning

2138
01:39:36,576 --> 01:39:37,600
Did so much good for

2139
01:39:38,112 --> 01:39:39,136
And I'm really happy

2140
01:39:41,184 --> 01:39:42,208
Everybody May 7th

2141
01:39:42,464 --> 01:39:43,232
Cheapest Chelsea Manning

2142
01:39:45,280 --> 01:39:45,792
But

2143
01:39:47,584 --> 01:39:48,608
All of the hate

2144
01:39:48,864 --> 01:39:49,376
From the United

2145
01:39:50,400 --> 01:39:52,192
And all the

2146
01:39:52,448 --> 01:39:54,240
Request for extradition in like

2147
01:39:54,496 --> 01:39:55,776
All of this

2148
01:39:56,288 --> 01:39:58,592
Is just really kind of like hey

2149
01:39:58,848 --> 01:40:00,384
You revealed we are evil

2150
01:40:00,640 --> 01:40:02,176
So we're going to do our best to demonize

2151
01:40:03,712 --> 01:40:05,248
Put you in prison for it like we do

2152
01:40:05,504 --> 01:40:06,016
Did Chelsea Manning

2153
01:40:06,528 --> 01:40:09,088
So then he's in the embassy

2154
01:40:09,600 --> 01:40:10,368
Trapped

2155
01:40:10,880 --> 01:40:14,464
Getting more and more hate-filled and losing his mind

2156
01:40:17,536 --> 01:40:22,656
Now but I think

2157
01:40:22,912 --> 01:40:24,448
I think that's

2158
01:40:24,704 --> 01:40:30,848
Already had that right before I already I

2159
01:40:31,104 --> 01:40:34,688
Think that your premise but he started out with good intentions is probably true

2160
01:40:34,944 --> 01:40:36,224
Then the same way that like I

2161
01:40:36,480 --> 01:40:39,040
I blurted out I think Alex probably did too

2162
01:40:39,552 --> 01:40:40,320
But I

2163
01:40:40,576 --> 01:40:44,672
I don't think it's as simple as you cooped up in a room and he turns super villain

2164
01:40:44,928 --> 01:40:47,232
I think there's negative parts of himself

2165
01:40:49,024 --> 01:40:50,048
Through either

2166
01:40:50,816 --> 01:40:53,888
I don't know man if you've been put in solitary confinement you lose your mind

2167
01:40:55,424 --> 01:40:57,472
Don't matter if

2168
01:40:57,728 --> 01:40:59,264
It doesn't matter if you've got a couch

2169
01:41:01,312 --> 01:41:03,616
If you're in solitary confinement your brain is going to melt

2170
01:41:04,128 --> 01:41:04,896
Dalton solitary can

2171
01:41:05,152 --> 01:41:05,920
He's basically

2172
01:41:07,712 --> 01:41:08,992
F****** farraj comes in

2173
01:41:09,248 --> 01:41:09,760
The Visitor

2174
01:41:10,016 --> 01:41:12,576
Nevermind I hate him

2175
01:41:12,832 --> 01:41:18,976
Sandwich

2176
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:20,512
Stereo

2177
01:41:21,024 --> 01:41:23,840
Isaac I retract that I have

2178
01:41:25,888 --> 01:41:29,472
I think there's negative pieces of

2179
01:41:29,728 --> 01:41:30,496
These characters

2180
01:41:31,008 --> 01:41:36,128
The Julian Assange is in the Alex Jones that weather through ego stroking or

2181
01:41:36,384 --> 01:41:36,896
Direct

2182
01:41:37,920 --> 01:41:38,688
Compromising

2183
01:41:39,200 --> 01:41:40,480
They've changed

2184
01:41:40,992 --> 01:41:43,808
From their initial goal of doing good

2185
01:41:44,064 --> 01:41:44,832
Into

2186
01:41:45,344 --> 01:41:48,160
Holding a line carrying a narrative

2187
01:41:48,928 --> 01:41:49,440
Yeah

2188
01:41:49,696 --> 01:41:53,536
I will absolutely

2189
01:41:54,048 --> 01:41:56,096
Julian Assange is not a megalomaniacal

2190
01:41:56,608 --> 01:41:57,376
Lunatic

2191
01:41:57,632 --> 01:41:59,424
Your complex

2192
01:41:59,680 --> 01:42:00,192
So this next

2193
01:42:00,448 --> 01:42:01,728
Just really

2194
01:42:01,984 --> 01:42:03,520
Pleasures out that Alex Jones

2195
01:42:03,776 --> 01:42:04,288
Not get

2196
01:42:04,544 --> 01:42:05,312
The conversation there have

2197
01:42:06,080 --> 01:42:06,848
And also the

2198
01:42:07,104 --> 01:42:07,616
Jerome corsi

2199
01:42:10,432 --> 01:42:14,016
So what of all the things are what are the true narrative

2200
01:42:21,440 --> 01:42:22,208
Alex

2201
01:42:22,464 --> 01:42:25,280
There's no argument

2202
01:42:28,352 --> 01:42:31,936
Is it going to be

2203
01:42:32,448 --> 01:42:37,056
Argument

2204
01:42:43,200 --> 01:42:47,296
Real dinosaur

2205
01:42:48,064 --> 01:42:49,600
We're fighting

2206
01:42:49,856 --> 01:42:53,952
The Holocaust music

2207
01:42:54,464 --> 01:43:00,608
It is gone now it's got to be stopped by techniques and find out

2208
01:43:00,864 --> 01:43:07,008
Military

2209
01:43:07,520 --> 01:43:09,312
You do not understand

2210
01:43:09,568 --> 01:43:10,336
Bugattis bombs

2211
01:43:10,592 --> 01:43:11,360
It kind of does

2212
01:43:11,616 --> 01:43:15,200
Make your argument stronger

2213
01:43:15,456 --> 01:43:16,736
Willfully not getting it

2214
01:43:17,760 --> 01:43:21,600
Cuz it does portray him as possibly understand propaganda

2215
01:43:23,136 --> 01:43:29,280
He can and Mike or self-defense mechanism because he comes

2216
01:43:29,536 --> 01:43:30,816
Exactly what he wants to talk about

2217
01:43:32,864 --> 01:43:33,376
Course he wants

2218
01:43:33,632 --> 01:43:34,912
Come in with a battle plan

2219
01:43:35,168 --> 01:43:37,216
Rat conceivably they haven't done show prep

2220
01:43:37,472 --> 01:43:39,264
Cuz I never do rightly comes in

2221
01:43:39,520 --> 01:43:40,288
He starts

2222
01:43:43,360 --> 01:43:43,872
Oh

2223
01:43:44,640 --> 01:43:45,152
You think so

2224
01:43:45,408 --> 01:43:46,432
No probably not

2225
01:43:46,688 --> 01:43:47,456
I think this is innocent

2226
01:43:47,968 --> 01:43:48,736
I think Alex

2227
01:43:48,992 --> 01:43:49,760
Really is

2228
01:43:50,016 --> 01:43:51,296
A simple idiot

2229
01:43:51,552 --> 01:43:52,832
That doesn't know

2230
01:43:53,088 --> 01:43:53,600
He is

2231
01:43:54,624 --> 01:43:56,160
He doesn't know when he

2232
01:43:56,416 --> 01:43:56,928
He's lying

2233
01:43:57,440 --> 01:43:58,464
I do think

2234
01:43:58,976 --> 01:44:01,024
He doesn't see himself as a propaganda

2235
01:44:02,304 --> 01:44:02,816
Take that as a

2236
01:44:03,072 --> 01:44:03,584
An insult

2237
01:44:03,840 --> 01:44:04,864
If you called him a proper

2238
01:44:05,632 --> 01:44:08,192
So Jerome corsi is basically saying

2239
01:44:08,704 --> 01:44:09,472
Invalidate

2240
01:44:09,728 --> 01:44:10,496
All the stuff

2241
01:44:10,752 --> 01:44:11,264
You believe in

2242
01:44:11,776 --> 01:44:13,056
And now engaged

2243
01:44:13,312 --> 01:44:13,824
In propaganda

2244
01:44:14,080 --> 01:44:15,872
Maybe yourself

2245
01:44:16,128 --> 01:44:17,152
It's not all the stuff

2246
01:44:17,408 --> 01:44:18,176
Text to generator

2247
01:44:18,432 --> 01:44:20,224
In in yourself

2248
01:44:22,528 --> 01:44:23,808
Where you're coming from but I think

2249
01:44:24,064 --> 01:44:24,576
Let's do generous

2250
01:44:26,624 --> 01:44:28,160
The lesson

2251
01:44:28,416 --> 01:44:29,184
On this episode

2252
01:44:31,232 --> 01:44:31,744
Let's get the

2253
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:33,792
It's just

2254
01:44:37,888 --> 01:44:40,448
Isn't it

2255
01:44:48,128 --> 01:44:49,152
First of all trumps not good

2256
01:44:51,200 --> 01:44:51,968
He cannot lie

2257
01:44:52,736 --> 01:44:53,248
And will not hear

2258
01:44:54,016 --> 01:44:55,040
And secondly

2259
01:44:55,296 --> 01:44:56,320
Thirdly this point

2260
01:44:57,856 --> 01:44:58,880
Your plan sucks

2261
01:45:00,416 --> 01:45:03,488
Just the plan of a propaganda campaign is good

2262
01:45:04,256 --> 01:45:05,280
In terms of like

2263
01:45:05,536 --> 01:45:06,048
Yeah

2264
01:45:06,816 --> 01:45:12,960
Millions of listeners that seems to be pretty effective

2265
01:45:13,216 --> 01:45:14,752
But all of your s*** on

2266
01:45:15,008 --> 01:45:18,336
In your article is not good it's not good propaganda

2267
01:45:18,592 --> 01:45:20,896
Bombing North Korea would be really disaster

2268
01:45:21,664 --> 01:45:24,736
It would get off of the Russian narrative but it would get back to it

2269
01:45:24,992 --> 01:45:28,064
It would only be a distraction for a temporary

2270
01:45:28,576 --> 01:45:29,088
So much.

2271
01:45:30,112 --> 01:45:31,136
Fixing the Middle East

2272
01:45:31,392 --> 01:45:33,440
Is not a reasonable goal

2273
01:45:33,952 --> 01:45:35,232
It's not something Trump

2274
01:45:35,488 --> 01:45:37,280
Can do you know what butt Trump

2275
01:45:38,304 --> 01:45:39,840
Okay trumpkin dream of fish

2276
01:45:40,864 --> 01:45:43,936
Destroying the schools in the environment will get him attack

2277
01:45:44,192 --> 01:45:45,216
Attack

2278
01:45:45,472 --> 01:45:46,496
In addition

2279
01:45:47,264 --> 01:45:48,800
Do the Russian stuff

2280
01:45:49,056 --> 01:45:50,848
He's already doing it like a

2281
01:45:51,104 --> 01:45:52,640
What's what's

2282
01:45:54,688 --> 01:45:58,528
Grant the loan forgiven

2283
01:45:58,784 --> 01:46:02,624
When is program at least she's trying to destroy everything

2284
01:46:02,880 --> 01:46:03,904
Food

2285
01:46:06,464 --> 01:46:07,744
They don't don't stop

2286
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:08,512
No

2287
01:46:08,768 --> 01:46:11,072
Stop calling her

2288
01:46:12,864 --> 01:46:17,216
That's how you change the narrative

2289
01:46:20,544 --> 01:46:22,592
I'm very conflicted because I miss episode you

2290
01:46:22,848 --> 01:46:23,616
Pic pics Alex

2291
01:46:23,872 --> 01:46:24,896
Very sympathetic light

2292
01:46:25,408 --> 01:46:28,224
Sympathetic at all

2293
01:46:28,480 --> 01:46:29,504
I think I'm calling him

2294
01:46:30,016 --> 01:46:30,528
Dumb

2295
01:46:31,040 --> 01:46:33,088
Sympathetic compared to

2296
01:46:33,600 --> 01:46:34,112
Like

2297
01:46:34,368 --> 01:46:36,416
Compare bearnaise

2298
01:46:42,560 --> 01:46:44,352
Well I guess it's

2299
01:46:44,864 --> 01:46:46,656
But like

2300
01:46:48,192 --> 01:46:48,960
They're giving up

2301
01:46:49,728 --> 01:46:50,496
Some of their cards

2302
01:46:51,008 --> 01:46:52,800
And the only reason that they would do that

2303
01:46:53,568 --> 01:46:54,080
Is

2304
01:46:54,848 --> 01:46:55,360
Desperation

2305
01:46:56,128 --> 01:46:56,896
Oh absolutely

2306
01:46:57,152 --> 01:46:59,968
I think this is a really bad sign for Infowars

2307
01:47:00,224 --> 01:47:01,760
And another really bad sign

2308
01:47:02,016 --> 01:47:03,552
Alex has just launched

2309
01:47:04,320 --> 01:47:05,344
Product

2310
01:47:06,112 --> 01:47:07,136
Unceremoniously

2311
01:47:07,392 --> 01:47:13,536
Oh no usually whenever you launches a product like you has doctor group come in for an hour and they talk about how great this new meta

2312
01:47:15,584 --> 01:47:16,864
Yeah but now like

2313
01:47:17,120 --> 01:47:19,168
Within the span of sensor last episode

2314
01:47:19,424 --> 01:47:21,728
He's got a new thing that helps you jump your car

2315
01:47:22,240 --> 01:47:27,360
Is that a product that helps you generate ever your car you just stick it in and jump

2316
01:47:27,616 --> 01:47:28,384
I don't know I don't know

2317
01:47:28,896 --> 01:47:31,200
I don't know is it is it just like a repurposed

2318
01:47:31,456 --> 01:47:33,504
February

2319
01:47:33,760 --> 01:47:34,528
I have no idea

2320
01:47:34,784 --> 01:47:35,296
It's insane

2321
01:47:35,552 --> 01:47:36,832
Computer and then

2322
01:47:37,088 --> 01:47:43,232
I meant he's also come out with a product is like mouthwash has a line of mouthwash and shampoo and stuff like that

2323
01:47:43,488 --> 01:47:44,512
Gotten into toiletries

2324
01:47:44,768 --> 01:47:48,864
Because I think you started to like a f*** people are buying my weird silver

2325
01:47:49,120 --> 01:47:49,632
Items

2326
01:47:49,888 --> 01:47:51,680
We have to go more mainstream with

2327
01:47:51,936 --> 01:47:53,216

2328
01:47:53,472 --> 01:47:56,288
You're going to buy all this stuff anyway from us

2329
01:47:57,056 --> 01:47:57,824
Buy it from us

2330
01:47:58,592 --> 01:47:59,104

You're in trouble

2335
01:48:09,856 --> 01:48:11,392
This is falling apart

2336
01:48:11,904 --> 01:48:13,184
You're trying to get all these

2337
01:48:13,440 --> 01:48:13,952
These like

2338
01:48:14,208 --> 01:48:18,048
I want a slug into the whole I want to see

2339
01:48:18,560 --> 01:48:19,072

Commercial sober

2341
01:48:21,888 --> 01:48:23,168

Northern Aether waterfall

2343
01:48:28,288 --> 01:48:31,616
Every magazine

2344
01:48:33,408 --> 01:48:35,968
So yeah I mean I just think all of this rings

2345
01:48:36,736 --> 01:48:38,272
Smells like desperation

2346
01:48:38,784 --> 01:48:39,296
It sound

2347
01:48:39,808 --> 01:48:40,320
Bad

2348
01:48:41,600 --> 01:48:43,392
We'll see what happens

2349
01:48:43,904 --> 01:48:46,464
If you watch Fox News one thing that I've noticed

2350
01:48:46,720 --> 01:48:47,232
In the past

2351
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:49,280
Is that

2352
01:48:49,792 --> 01:48:51,072
They're pulling a lot of the

2353
01:48:52,864 --> 01:48:54,912
Like they're pulling

2354
01:48:55,168 --> 01:48:57,472
Pulling like pulling all of this

2355
01:48:57,728 --> 01:49:00,288
Look at what Hillary did don't look at it don't look a

2356
01:49:00,800 --> 01:49:02,592
Don't look at all this s*** we're going to

2357
01:49:03,104 --> 01:49:04,640
We're going to do an interview with f******

2358
01:49:04,896 --> 01:49:05,408
Ted Nugent

2359
01:49:05,664 --> 01:49:07,712
Fresh

2360
01:49:07,968 --> 01:49:10,272
Yeah

2361
01:49:10,784 --> 01:49:12,576
Which is the biggest sign

2362
01:49:13,600 --> 01:49:15,904
Used to hang their hat on

2363
01:49:16,160 --> 01:49:17,184
Pretending to be

2364
01:49:21,536 --> 01:49:27,424
Do you know what it is it's a landslide that Scott happening corporate conservative news is now

2365
01:49:27,680 --> 01:49:33,056
Flipping down

2366
01:49:35,104 --> 01:49:36,384
Hosting the shows that are going to get them

2367
01:49:36,640 --> 01:49:37,152
Kicked off the air

2368
01:49:37,408 --> 01:49:39,456
Then at the same time because it is a

2369
01:49:39,968 --> 01:49:41,248
Complete Landslide on the right

2370
01:49:41,760 --> 01:49:42,784
Where Alex was

2371
01:49:43,040 --> 01:49:43,552
Where

2372
01:49:43,808 --> 01:49:46,112
Fox News is now has flipped down

2373
01:49:46,368 --> 01:49:48,672
Let's start an actual property

2374
01:49:50,208 --> 01:49:52,512
And you know what they are on the Vanguard

2375
01:49:53,024 --> 01:49:59,168
Yeah that is

2376
01:50:00,704 --> 01:50:02,752
Is there were a few

2377
01:50:03,008 --> 01:50:03,776
Like ratings

2378
01:50:04,544 --> 01:50:05,568
Evaluation

2379
01:50:06,336 --> 01:50:06,848
And

2380
01:50:07,360 --> 01:50:08,128
It's starting to

2381
01:50:08,384 --> 01:50:12,224
Too because Fox News used to be Far and Away the most highly-rated

2382
01:50:12,480 --> 01:50:13,248
Sure

2383
01:50:13,504 --> 01:50:14,016
News

2384
01:50:16,064 --> 01:50:18,368
Exactly

2385
01:50:19,392 --> 01:50:20,416
The highly-rated Bulge

2386
01:50:22,208 --> 01:50:22,720
The truck stuff is

2387
01:50:23,488 --> 01:50:24,000
Started

2388
01:50:24,256 --> 01:50:25,792
It's actually been more CNN

2389
01:50:26,304 --> 01:50:27,840
And NBC in the light

2390
01:50:28,096 --> 01:50:29,632
MSN

2391
01:50:31,424 --> 01:50:31,936
Because

2392
01:50:32,192 --> 01:50:33,472
Because Fox News is

2393
01:50:36,288 --> 01:50:37,056
Blatantly

2394
01:50:37,568 --> 01:50:38,080
Ignoring

2395
01:50:38,336 --> 01:50:39,360
Every possible app

2396
01:50:40,384 --> 01:50:42,176
They are not dealing with

2397
01:50:42,432 --> 01:50:43,968
Anything so

2398
01:50:44,224 --> 01:50:44,736
Attention Lisa

2399
01:50:44,992 --> 01:50:46,784
To the point of they are

2400
01:50:49,088 --> 01:50:50,112
I mean bald-faced

2401
01:50:51,392 --> 01:50:52,416
Running a propaganda

2402
01:50:52,928 --> 01:50:57,536
Yeah like they might as well be talking to Jerome corsi and I'm sure that the next

2403
01:50:57,792 --> 01:50:59,072
Sting on Fox News is going to be like

2404
01:50:59,840 --> 01:51:03,424
Will trump bring pizza the Middle East by going to Saudi Arabia

2405
01:51:06,752 --> 01:51:10,080
Pulitzer prize-winning author of course

2406
01:51:10,592 --> 01:51:12,384
So also I agree it's a mess

2407
01:51:12,640 --> 01:51:14,944
But before we get out of here I want to give an update

2408
01:51:15,200 --> 01:51:18,016
A week and a half ago

2409
01:51:18,272 --> 01:51:21,344
Alex had as his guest this weirdo from New Orleans

2410
01:51:21,856 --> 01:51:23,136
Who rides around on a bike with

2411
01:51:23,392 --> 01:51:24,160
The TV behind him

2412
01:51:24,416 --> 01:51:25,184
Infowars

2413
01:51:25,696 --> 01:51:26,208
Okay

2414
01:51:31,072 --> 01:51:32,096
I want Alex

2415
01:51:32,352 --> 01:51:32,864
Taken out

2416
01:51:34,912 --> 01:51:36,192
My son was brainwashed

2417
01:51:37,216 --> 01:51:38,240
So you don't understand

2418
01:51:39,776 --> 01:51:41,568
This guy is

2419
01:51:43,104 --> 01:51:44,640
About like

2420
01:51:44,896 --> 01:51:46,176
Free speech

2421
01:51:47,456 --> 01:51:48,992
He puts out this video

2422
01:51:55,392 --> 01:52:01,280
And all this

2423
01:52:01,536 --> 01:52:04,096
So this guy

2424
01:52:04,352 --> 01:52:05,376
Don't talk about

2425
01:52:05,888 --> 01:52:07,168
Until you talk about all the Falcons

2426
01:52:07,424 --> 01:52:08,704
Put it on YouTube

2427
01:52:12,288 --> 01:52:13,312
Start a GoFundMe

2428
01:52:13,824 --> 01:52:14,592

2429
01:52:18,688 --> 01:52:19,968

Maybe I'm in

2432
01:52:28,160 --> 01:52:30,208

2433
01:52:32,256 --> 01:52:33,024
Is 10 a fever

2434
01:52:35,328 --> 01:52:38,656
Reviews on the show and he's trying to raise $30,000

2435
01:52:38,912 --> 01:52:39,424

2437
01:52:41,216 --> 01:52:41,984

This GoFundMe campaign was started on May 10th

2443
01:52:58,112 --> 01:53:00,672
What guess how much they have now of the 30,000

2444
01:53:01,440 --> 01:53:03,488
Million hundred 450

2445
01:53:05,536 --> 01:53:06,560
435

2446
01:53:09,376 --> 01:53:12,960
A first time I've got something even remotely close

2447
01:53:13,472 --> 01:53:19,104
That's crazy you have no motivation

2448
01:53:19,616 --> 01:53:22,176
Well yeah of course I do

2449
01:53:22,944 --> 01:53:23,968
