Alright

00:36:18,304 --> 00:36:20,096
Was the Gutenberg Press

396
00:36:20,352 --> 00:36:22,400
That works

397
00:36:36,224 --> 00:36:36,736
What

398
00:36:43,648 --> 00:36:44,160
First

399
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:52,096
Coronavirus graph

400
00:36:52,352 --> 00:36:53,632
Also

401
00:36:53,888 --> 00:36:57,984
Do historians agree that the Renaissance didn't end until the global

402
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:03,360
Wish

403
00:37:10,016 --> 00:37:11,552
But from my understanding

404
00:37:13,088 --> 00:37:13,600
Primarily

405
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:15,904
Something happened in Italy

406
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,696
Yeah

407
00:37:20,256 --> 00:37:22,560
Europe

408
00:37:34,592 --> 00:37:35,616
Maybe baby

409
00:37:42,016 --> 00:37:45,856
Okay

410
00:37:47,136 --> 00:37:52,000
Tuesday 14 15

411
00:37:52,512 --> 00:37:58,656
I wouldn't

412
00:38:09,152 --> 00:38:12,992
Licenses

413
00:38:13,248 --> 00:38:18,624
They try to take control of society they fund mouses and they fund Dalton and they fun eugenics

414
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:31,424
But don't worry about it

415
00:38:39,616 --> 00:38:43,200
Italian Renaissance

416
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,680
Beginning point but a lot of life

417
00:39:11,104 --> 00:39:11,616
Which part of the film

418
00:39:14,432 --> 00:39:15,712
Never heard of it

419
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:25,696
The American Renaissance

420
00:39:25,952 --> 00:39:27,232
Between 1876 and 9

421
00:39:27,488 --> 00:39:29,024
1917

422
00:39:29,536 --> 00:39:30,048
Discovered

423
00:39:32,096 --> 00:39:35,680
What he's talking about

424
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:58,208
I think this might be 200 episode

425
00:39:58,720 --> 00:39:59,232
That's enough

426
00:40:03,584 --> 00:40:07,936
Happened

427
00:40:08,448 --> 00:40:14,080
Before the Civil War I think Alex is illiterate so I don't

428
00:40:14,592 --> 00:40:16,128
What are you talking about

429
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:17,152
Fun fact

430
00:40:17,408 --> 00:40:20,992
There's a white supremacist magazine called the American Renaissance

431
00:40:26,368 --> 00:40:28,672
But they don't have as much to lose

432
00:40:29,184 --> 00:40:29,952
So they

433
00:40:30,208 --> 00:40:31,744
It's very clear they're talking about white people

434
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,792
Absolutely

435
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:39,168
It's fun code

436
00:40:44,288 --> 00:40:50,176
American Renaissance the sound

437
00:40:50,688 --> 00:40:53,248
Donald Trump

438
00:40:53,504 --> 00:40:54,528
Because he's the one candidate

439
00:40:54,784 --> 00:40:57,344
Who points out that we should accept immigrants York

440
00:40:57,856 --> 00:40:58,880
We don't need Muslim

441
00:41:03,488 --> 00:41:04,256
Vote Trump

442
00:41:04,768 --> 00:41:09,120
American Renaissance

443
00:41:10,912 --> 00:41:15,008
Very similar

444
00:41:16,544 --> 00:41:17,824
I don't know

445
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:18,592
Eastern Europe

446
00:41:19,616 --> 00:41:20,640
Are we getting a lot of Russian

447
00:41:33,184 --> 00:41:39,328
Never listen to a podcast very uncomfortable

448
00:41:40,864 --> 00:41:46,752
During me reading about a white supremacist

449
00:41:47,776 --> 00:41:50,848
You never heard of

450
00:41:51,104 --> 00:41:52,384
Keep talking it's a weird thing

451
00:41:55,199 --> 00:41:56,223
Alex

452
00:41:56,735 --> 00:42:00,063
Burlesque

453
00:42:03,647 --> 00:42:06,463
You know you take your medicine

454
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:07,999
We can all have fun

455
00:42:16,447 --> 00:42:16,959
Al Gore

456
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:26,431
Here's another one

457
00:42:27,455 --> 00:42:28,735
His quotes

458
00:42:30,527 --> 00:42:32,319
Eec

459
00:42:39,999 --> 00:42:44,095
What do you

460
00:42:44,351 --> 00:42:44,863
Alright

461
00:42:47,423 --> 00:42:47,935
Furious

462
00:42:52,031 --> 00:42:53,567
I mean baby.

463
00:42:55,871 --> 00:42:56,383
If you

464
00:42:57,663 --> 00:42:58,431
Humanity was put

465
00:42:58,687 --> 00:43:01,247
Together

466
00:43:01,759 --> 00:43:06,623
Yeah

467
00:43:30,175 --> 00:43:34,271
Spoiler alert

468
00:43:38,111 --> 00:43:38,623
Do you know this

469
00:43:38,879 --> 00:43:40,415
ETA is looking into helicopters

470
00:43:40,671 --> 00:43:43,999
Very efficient

471
00:43:45,023 --> 00:43:47,839
What's going on

472
00:43:49,887 --> 00:43:50,655
Alright

473
00:43:52,447 --> 00:43:54,751
Can I get another

474
00:43:55,519 --> 00:43:56,031
What's up

475
00:43:57,311 --> 00:43:58,079
There's a God

476
00:43:58,335 --> 00:44:00,383
Hell yeah

477
00:44:01,407 --> 00:44:03,711
Just celebrate

478
00:44:05,759 --> 00:44:06,527
That's me being petty

479
00:44:12,927 --> 00:44:13,695
Just that

480
00:44:14,207 --> 00:44:15,999
Izod

481
00:44:17,535 --> 00:44:19,327
Where's the funeral

482
00:44:27,263 --> 00:44:29,567
One and a half Stars

483
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:34,431
So the only in that article is this

484
00:44:34,687 --> 00:44:38,015
It is crucial that we build public will for an agreement

485
00:44:38,271 --> 00:44:43,903
The purposes of climate action now

486
00:44:44,159 --> 00:44:44,671
Through the issues

487
00:44:44,927 --> 00:44:47,487
The article is about

488
00:44:47,743 --> 00:44:51,839
Public transit in developing

489
00:44:52,095 --> 00:44:52,863
And improving

490
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:55,679
Public transit in existing urban areas

491
00:44:56,191 --> 00:45:01,311
So I have to go further than the Daily Caller

492
00:45:01,567 --> 00:45:03,871
Business Insider articles

493
00:45:06,175 --> 00:45:11,295
Hey I needed to drop in here because

494
00:45:11,551 --> 00:45:17,695
We have a situation where the recording of the the episode here

495
00:45:17,951 --> 00:45:19,999
Look up the card that we were recording on

496
00:45:20,255 --> 00:45:24,351
And so there's a little bit of a drop-off in terms of

497
00:45:24,607 --> 00:45:27,679
Just a little bit of the conversation and eye drops out

498
00:45:27,935 --> 00:45:33,311
Just wanted to fill you in on what we were talking about

499
00:45:33,567 --> 00:45:39,711
Susan the middle of a conversation we're having about algor wanting to ban cars and I guess I don't need to reset it up you guys

500
00:45:39,967 --> 00:45:40,479
Is just heard it

501
00:45:40,735 --> 00:45:43,295
Business Insider article

502
00:45:43,551 --> 00:45:46,879
It goes on to explain that Felipe Calderon

503
00:45:47,135 --> 00:45:48,927
I was quoted

504
00:45:49,183 --> 00:45:55,327
It's talking about how there's a priority that we don't build up cities that pointlessly have low density

505
00:45:55,583 --> 00:45:58,655
I just for the sake of people using cars that's much smarter

506
00:45:59,167 --> 00:46:02,751
And much more efficient that we should have hired a diarias

507
00:46:03,007 --> 00:46:07,103
With mass transportation that's Services everybody much more efficient way

508
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:11,199
Hey somebody who lives in the city with amazing mass transportation

509
00:46:11,455 --> 00:46:15,551
And then also look at it as transportation out to

510
00:46:15,807 --> 00:46:18,367
The suburbs were a lot of people like to live

511
00:46:18,623 --> 00:46:21,951
I you feel very much in line I very much agree with that

512
00:46:22,719 --> 00:46:25,791
Also Alex is reporting on this of the story

513
00:46:26,047 --> 00:46:27,583
Is him saying that

514
00:46:27,839 --> 00:46:32,703
Al Gore wants to spend 90 trillion dollars in order to ban cars

515
00:46:32,959 --> 00:46:35,263
Which is a

516
00:46:36,031 --> 00:46:37,823
Misrepresentation of things

517
00:46:38,335 --> 00:46:44,479
At the show would ask if there was actually 90 trillion-dollar

518
00:46:44,735 --> 00:46:46,783
Hours in the world and I said I do know that

519
00:46:47,039 --> 00:46:53,183
Because of his Business Insider article and then it goes

520
00:46:53,439 --> 00:46:54,463
Business Insider article

521
00:46:54,719 --> 00:47:00,863
Quote it turns out the 90 trillion is a total of infrastructure investment that is likely to be spent anyway build

522
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:02,399
Pulling up in a grading City

523
00:47:02,655 --> 00:47:08,799
Brian Calderon are arguing that it be spent more wisely

524
00:47:09,055 --> 00:47:10,079
Able to burn fossil fuels

525
00:47:10,335 --> 00:47:12,127
Just to get from point A to B

526
00:47:12,383 --> 00:47:18,527
Trillion dollars in something without Gore is encouraging people spend it's a reference to the amount that would be Spa

527
00:47:18,783 --> 00:47:22,367
Event structure projects of this sort anyway

528
00:47:22,623 --> 00:47:25,951
So there you go. That's what we were talking about

529
00:47:26,207 --> 00:47:28,767
Will jump back to where the recording picks up

530
00:47:29,023 --> 00:47:30,303
With another

531
00:47:30,815 --> 00:47:32,607
Bulshit story that Alex is telling

532
00:47:32,863 --> 00:47:33,887
All the best folks

533
00:47:39,519 --> 00:47:40,287
Now we get to

534
00:47:40,543 --> 00:47:41,311
You probably

535
00:47:41,823 --> 00:47:42,847
Favorite story that Alex

536
00:47:46,175 --> 00:47:46,943
The bad

537
00:47:49,503 --> 00:47:55,647
Stream the German newspapers

538
00:47:57,695 --> 00:48:03,839
Description

539
00:48:04,351 --> 00:48:05,631
His rule

540
00:48:06,143 --> 00:48:09,215
But they will not

541
00:48:11,007 --> 00:48:14,591
For a feminist landowner appointment

542
00:48:18,687 --> 00:48:20,479
Michelle Obama's kids

543
00:48:51,711 --> 00:48:57,855
I've never been more

544
00:49:10,655 --> 00:49:11,423
Do Germans

545
00:49:13,983 --> 00:49:14,751
Oh no that's

546
00:49:16,799 --> 00:49:17,311
There's a

547
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:20,383
The article that he's going off of headache

548
00:49:24,735 --> 00:49:25,503
11 converter

549
00:49:27,551 --> 00:49:28,575
Absolutely

550
00:49:29,855 --> 00:49:35,999
Is the story that he talked about his super fun first of all

551
00:49:36,255 --> 00:49:38,303
Men's rights to piss standing up

552
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:40,863
And that's really funny because I haven't

553
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:42,655
This story is about

554
00:49:44,447 --> 00:49:45,215
Who's landlord

555
00:49:48,287 --> 00:49:48,799
You have

556
00:49:50,335 --> 00:49:50,847
You spill

557
00:49:52,383 --> 00:49:54,175
Around the toilet I'm suing you

558
00:49:54,431 --> 00:49:55,199
Because

559
00:49:55,967 --> 00:49:56,735
Covered

560
00:49:56,991 --> 00:49:57,759
Your eyes

561
00:50:06,207 --> 00:50:06,975
Ended up being

562
00:50:07,487 --> 00:50:09,279
Sounded favor of the

563
00:50:12,607 --> 00:50:14,655
Landlord as a man

564
00:50:28,735 --> 00:50:32,063
The rhythm of your speech

565
00:50:39,743 --> 00:50:42,047
Former tenant to court

566
00:50:42,303 --> 00:50:43,839
Marble floors the bathroom in

567
00:50:44,095 --> 00:50:45,375
And he said was

568
00:50:46,399 --> 00:50:48,447
Spray drops from

569
00:50:56,639 --> 00:50:59,455
Trivia

570
00:51:13,023 --> 00:51:15,583
I do think it's really funny and everybody

571
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:17,375
If you want to look into it

572
00:51:17,887 --> 00:51:19,423
A little bit of

573
00:51:19,679 --> 00:51:20,703
Debate in Germany

574
00:51:20,959 --> 00:51:25,055
About whether or not

575
00:51:25,567 --> 00:51:26,847
Publix

576
00:51:34,015 --> 00:51:40,159
It's just a question I have

577
00:51:40,415 --> 00:51:46,559
You say you're drunk enough to piss on the wall you're not drunk enough

578
00:51:51,935 --> 00:51:53,471
Alright

579
00:51:53,727 --> 00:51:55,007
So anyway he's not done with this

580
00:52:04,991 --> 00:52:07,295
The feminists aren't trying to make boys

581
00:52:07,807 --> 00:52:09,343
Elementary School

582
00:52:11,391 --> 00:52:13,183
High School PE setting

583
00:52:14,207 --> 00:52:17,535
Because it makes girls feel bad

584
00:52:19,071 --> 00:52:20,095
What

585
00:52:20,351 --> 00:52:23,423
Tell you how to urinate

586
00:52:35,199 --> 00:52:37,759
We did a whole lot

587
00:52:42,879 --> 00:52:43,903
I know I get it

588
00:52:44,159 --> 00:52:48,511
Make fun of nerds

589
00:52:52,095 --> 00:52:58,239
That's the worst Tim Allen I've ever heard in my entire life

590
00:53:00,543 --> 00:53:03,359
That's required

591
00:53:10,271 --> 00:53:12,063
Excited when he wants to talk to Google tell me how to

592
00:53:17,951 --> 00:53:18,719
It's probably one of my favorite

593
00:53:21,791 --> 00:53:22,815
Sometimes baby

594
00:53:25,631 --> 00:53:29,215
I don't know if you know this but

595
00:53:38,431 --> 00:53:39,711
I feel like that's important

596
00:53:51,487 --> 00:53:57,631
I decided to steal

597
00:53:57,887 --> 00:54:01,215
Sounds like it's cute

598
00:54:01,727 --> 00:54:03,263
Clipper

599
00:54:03,519 --> 00:54:04,799
Is one of my favorite things

600
00:54:06,079 --> 00:54:06,591
If

601
00:54:06,847 --> 00:54:07,359
If you really listen

602
00:54:08,127 --> 00:54:08,895
No

603
00:54:09,151 --> 00:54:10,175
Did Alex knows

604
00:54:11,711 --> 00:54:12,735
Show on KLBJ

605
00:54:13,247 --> 00:54:13,759
In Austin

606
00:54:15,039 --> 00:54:15,551
You just tell like

607
00:54:27,839 --> 00:54:30,655
B****** f****** droopy dogs

608
00:54:39,615 --> 00:54:45,759
Incredible than white

609
00:54:48,831 --> 00:54:51,391
The Time Square mentality

610
00:54:52,671 --> 00:54:58,815
The world is so much bigger than just dominating

611
00:55:11,871 --> 00:55:18,015
Universe

612
00:55:20,575 --> 00:55:21,087
No

613
00:55:25,439 --> 00:55:25,951
The premise

614
00:55:31,839 --> 00:55:32,351
Tired

615
00:55:34,143 --> 00:55:37,727
Alright

616
00:55:39,007 --> 00:55:41,055
So at this point what he decides

617
00:55:41,311 --> 00:55:43,103
I got to feel bad another

618
00:55:43,359 --> 00:55:43,871
40 minutes

619
00:55:44,127 --> 00:55:45,407
The radio

620
00:55:46,687 --> 00:55:47,199
Make some calls

621
00:55:52,063 --> 00:55:53,087
Publix

622
00:56:21,247 --> 00:56:23,551
Culture adopted because it was the most efficient

623
00:56:34,303 --> 00:56:36,351
This is

624
00:56:48,383 --> 00:56:52,223
It's a class that this Arizona professor was teaching about the problem of whiteness

625
00:56:56,575 --> 00:57:02,207
Historical implications Canary ideas

626
00:57:04,255 --> 00:57:08,607
Contributor to society or whatever but

627
00:57:09,631 --> 00:57:15,775
So now just for fun Idol

628
00:57:16,031 --> 00:57:18,335
Culture

629
00:57:30,111 --> 00:57:31,391
Cedros toothbrushes

630
00:57:31,647 --> 00:57:32,159
Money

631
00:57:35,999 --> 00:57:36,511
Artillery

632
00:57:38,815 --> 00:57:40,863
Adventures that might not be right I might have missed

633
00:57:43,679 --> 00:57:47,007
I'm going to stand by it anyway

634
00:57:52,383 --> 00:57:52,895
Toilet paper

635
00:57:54,687 --> 00:57:55,455
Perverted

636
00:57:58,015 --> 00:57:59,551
Reliv Wells before

637
00:58:17,471 --> 00:58:19,007
I feel like whatever you're like

638
00:58:19,263 --> 00:58:25,151
All of these cultures that literally invented all the stuff we built off of

639
00:58:25,407 --> 00:58:27,199
Just because

640
00:58:27,455 --> 00:58:29,503
Came up with the number zero that's

641
00:58:29,759 --> 00:58:31,039
Changing the entire scope

642
00:58:31,295 --> 00:58:32,575
Humanity

643
00:58:32,831 --> 00:58:33,343
Doesn't mean

644
00:58:38,207 --> 00:58:39,743
Big round of applause

645
00:58:40,255 --> 00:58:40,767
You love

646
00:58:41,279 --> 00:58:42,303
Infowars supplements

647
00:58:48,703 --> 00:58:52,543
If you do then you know that

648
00:58:52,799 --> 00:58:55,359
What is very wishy-washy about

649
00:58:56,639 --> 00:58:57,919
Is whether or not

650
00:58:58,175 --> 00:58:59,455
Super male vitality

651
00:58:59,711 --> 00:59:00,223
Is a boner pill

652
00:59:02,527 --> 00:59:03,295
He pretended

653
00:59:03,551 --> 00:59:04,319
When he wants

654
00:59:04,575 --> 00:59:05,087
Tubi

655
00:59:07,903 --> 00:59:09,183
It's like

656
00:59:11,487 --> 00:59:13,279
Superman

657
00:59:18,399 --> 00:59:21,727
My wife

658
00:59:23,263 --> 00:59:25,311

659
00:59:25,567 --> 00:59:27,103
Once and for all

660
00:59:27,359 --> 00:59:27,871
With this

661
00:59:28,127 --> 00:59:29,663
Completely absurd

662
00:59:46,815 --> 00:59:52,959
How much does Shayla

663
00:59:59,359 --> 01:00:00,127
Nailed it

664
01:00:00,639 --> 01:00:04,735

Come to here

669
01:01:02,591 --> 01:01:06,943
Franklin listening at home a Cascade of roses

670
01:01:10,527 --> 01:01:14,367
Fun

671
01:01:14,879 --> 01:01:15,647
Literally the last

672
01:01:17,695 --> 01:01:18,207

He's not interested

01:03:25,439 --> 01:03:27,743
Retirement show is still on

702
01:03:29,791 --> 01:03:31,583
Their retirement show is still getting played

703
01:03:32,095 --> 01:03:35,423
Also really fun I found this while looking around trying to see

704
01:03:35,679 --> 01:03:37,983
Figure out the bottom

01:03:38,239 --> 01:03:40,031
Next

706
01:03:40,799 --> 01:03:44,127
The people at KLBJ were so kind and generous

707
01:03:45,663 --> 01:03:47,199
Allowed

708
01:03:49,247 --> 01:03:53,343
Were they were they kind and generous to quote

01:03:59,743 --> 01:04:04,095
You're right now

710
01:04:07,679 --> 01:04:10,751
I can't remember the rest of the lyrics I got to be honest

711
01:04:11,007 --> 01:04:13,055
They allowed him to broadcast

712
01:04:14,847 --> 01:04:17,919
If you was on

713
01:04:19,455 --> 01:04:25,599
Listeners of my show here on

714
01:04:27,391 --> 01:04:30,719
The decision has been made to move the local programming on Sunday

And even though my show national news

716
01:04:34,815 --> 01:04:35,327

01:05:03,999 --> 01:05:06,559
I found an article that was posted on the internet

725

C.j. Morgan

726
01:05:07,839 --> 01:05:08,607

The weekday 7 p.m. tonight

728
01:05:13,471 --> 01:05:15,775
You went so far as to post on their website

729
01:05:17,311 --> 01:05:18,079
The following headlines

730
01:05:18,335 --> 01:05:23,711
Jurusan I'm ashamed we ever had him on this station

731
01:05:30,623 --> 01:05:34,719

I don't care I don't care

734
01:05:41,631 --> 01:05:42,655
There's a freedom

735
01:05:43,167 --> 01:05:47,519
Misspelled

736
01:05:57,247 --> 01:05:58,015
That's a good show

737
01:06:05,695 --> 01:06:06,207
Come on

738
01:06:11,327 --> 01:06:14,143
I don't like the first word

739
01:06:14,399 --> 01:06:15,167
I really don't

740
01:06:16,447 --> 01:06:20,543
I do like the idea of

741
01:06:32,831 --> 01:06:34,111
Eventually it became too much

742
01:06:34,623 --> 01:06:37,695
He's at his blatant disregard for any rational truth

743
01:06:38,207 --> 01:06:39,487
The way he capitalized

744
01:06:42,815 --> 01:06:43,327
His listeners

745
01:06:47,423 --> 01:06:50,239
Our encounters with truly mentally ill followers

746
01:06:53,055 --> 01:06:53,823
I was needing his help

747
01:06:54,079 --> 01:06:54,847
In parentheses

748
01:06:55,103 --> 01:06:56,639
He hates his fans by the way

749
01:06:57,919 --> 01:06:58,687
It's too much

750
01:07:10,719 --> 01:07:11,743
Is that quote

751
01:07:16,863 --> 01:07:21,215
Overstudying a year-and-a-half summarized everything we've ever tried

752
01:07:23,775 --> 01:07:25,311
I will say that I wish

753
01:07:28,639 --> 01:07:30,943
I wish I would have spent less time

754
01:07:31,199 --> 01:07:32,735
Like low his raising

755
01:07:33,503 --> 01:07:34,527
I talk more about that

756
01:07:38,111 --> 01:07:39,647
I would recommend everyone look into

757
01:07:46,815 --> 01:07:48,095
I don't want that out there

758
01:07:48,607 --> 01:07:50,911
Everyone out there in Elizabeth

759
01:07:51,167 --> 01:07:51,679
Make

760
01:07:51,935 --> 01:07:52,959
Make a techno remix

761
01:07:53,471 --> 01:07:56,799
Of Jordan saying I'm in German

762
01:07:59,615 --> 01:08:00,127
If you need one

763
01:08:01,407 --> 01:08:03,455
I mean

764
01:08:04,735 --> 01:08:05,247
You know

770
01:08:39,295 --> 01:08:40,063
I love it

771
01:08:57,727 --> 01:08:58,239
I don't know how to do

772
01:09:00,799 --> 01:09:02,079
I don't think

773
01:09:08,735 --> 01:09:10,015
Themselves
