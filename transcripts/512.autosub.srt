1
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:20,736
Air Jordan 5 sweat it

2
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:27,136
I have great respect for this knowledge B I'm sick of them

3
00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:39,936
MoneyGram

4
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:56,320
Knowledge fight

5
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:59,136
Dot-com

6
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:02,208
Acknowledge

7
00:01:02,464 --> 00:01:04,768
Looks around a little bit about Allie

8
00:01:05,024 --> 00:01:08,096
Text Joe

9
00:01:08,352 --> 00:01:14,496
What is recognition

10
00:01:15,264 --> 00:01:17,568
It's from now centuries

11
00:01:17,824 --> 00:01:18,336
For now

12
00:01:18,592 --> 00:01:20,384
This will be looked upon as the week

13
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,664
Give too much of you and me

14
00:01:25,248 --> 00:01:31,392
Play the week of too much sauce that you are under

15
00:01:31,648 --> 00:01:32,928
Estimating exactly how much

16
00:01:33,184 --> 00:01:34,720
More we're going to do in the weeks

17
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:38,048
This is this is

18
00:01:38,304 --> 00:01:39,328
Extensive week of

19
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:40,352
Programming

20
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:42,912
In between episode on Earth

21
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:45,984
A little bonus episode and then also thank you

22
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,008
To Robert Sophie

23
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:54,944
Something of that I got to bring information to the table

24
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,480
Everyone

25
00:01:56,736 --> 00:01:58,272
About invention

26
00:01:58,528 --> 00:02:01,344
From

27
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,136
Do you recall that

28
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:09,536
That's something we talked about on this year but apparently was new to the proceedings I would say that you were so excited

29
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:15,936
Credible excited he was shivering and shaking almost as though there was there was like

30
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:22,336
You know it's just something I couldn't feel better

31
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:24,384
My bright spot too much of us

32
00:02:26,176 --> 00:02:28,992
My bright spot is

33
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:29,760
Taylor Swift

34
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:31,296
Taylor Swift

35
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:35,904
Because I was worried about that

36
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:36,672
No

37
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:38,720
Yeah I decided

38
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:41,536
Did this start listening to every Taylor's I've never listened

39
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:42,304
Taylor Swift

40
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:48,960
I don't never been to a Walgreens or in full

41
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:52,800
So I've never done that before and then I was

42
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:55,104
I really been struggling to come up with a project

43
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:56,896
The book ended

44
00:02:57,408 --> 00:02:58,176
And I've just been like

45
00:02:58,944 --> 00:03:03,040
Throwing shade at the wall and it's not been going well here comes another

46
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:09,184
For some reason I was like you know what I've decided to listen to every one of Taylor Swift's album

47
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,208
In a row

48
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:15,072
Chronological order and review each one we talked about this a little bit

49
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:18,400
You for this because I think it's going to have a really negative tone

50
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:23,520
Oh man is it dark yeah it is it is very fun to be

51
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:27,104
Incredibly mean to a seventeen-year-old who was going to go on to be a billion

52
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:29,920
I also resent that

53
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:36,320
At this point you're still like at a point where I can't really read but anything you're saying I don't know anything about Taylor Swift

54
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:42,464
But what if you start getting real shity about some problems we might have words

55
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:47,328
I think I think of you read it you will find that I am very complimentary

56
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:49,632
Towards things that deserve compliments okay

57
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:53,472
And I am hyperbolically incredibly cruel to things that are just

58
00:03:54,240 --> 00:04:00,384
Okay you know I like that kind of friend of the show Messiah

59
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,152
Bias draft

60
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:03,456
Steve's website fancy Boys Club.

61
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:06,784
I'll be posting those probably once a week or

62
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:08,064
Until I get

63
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,856
Really pissed off at Taylor Swift

64
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:15,488
Decide never to do this again I will write my rebuttal

65
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:22,143
No refund but there will be only personally attacking you personally attacking you

66
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:23,167
What you should do is

67
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:26,239
Do the exact same thing but for each chapter of my book

68
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:31,103
Every week we'll just hate each other ever written that pop masterpiece

69
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:32,127
No

70
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:33,407
Absolutely not

71
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:37,759
Alright

72
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:42,111
December 16th and 17th 2020 of dances of 2020

73
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:44,159
Interesting and weird this week

74
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:46,975
We're going to have a little bit of a I don't know

75
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:53,375
Memento Style

76
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:00,543
YouTube book to sign up for sporting show

77
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:03,871

Money off at heroin

89
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:07,871
Freakishly large

90
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:14,527
The Big Easy bless both of you

91
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:17,343
These dads do you do that

92
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:19,391
Website.com

93
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:26,815
What you could do is create some sort of tortured analogy towards trying to find writing something about Taylor

94
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:28,351
Into a generosity thank

95
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:32,959
But I was just suggest that you guys go to your local charity or bail fund

96
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:39,359
And support easy Road on this side of my hair today

97
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:40,639
Think about it

98
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:44,991
You're trying to get a little to Meadow with his right now

99
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:47,039
All right now

100
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:48,831
I wanted

101
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:50,367
Play The Sound of Silence

102
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:54,463
To start this episode over. Be very happy if I decided not to

103
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:57,023
Call real quick I have one

104
00:06:57,535 --> 00:07:03,679
The business

105
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:08,287
Reached out to me

106
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:09,055
Ask me

107
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:10,591
Politely if we would wish

108
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:13,151
Her partner a happy birthday

109
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:16,991
His name is Joe and I was told that the way to identify him

110
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:19,295
Was that he skips over our theme song

111
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:23,903
OSHA then made me be like I might even going to f****** do this now

112
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:28,767
There we were going to play it again

113
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:32,863
Happy birthday to birthday jokes

114
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:37,215
I hope you have a good one

115
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:41,567
Birthday this year wasn't supposed their favorite birthday on totally

116
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:43,359
Nope

117
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:46,431
Here's the other

118
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:47,455
What's up

119
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:48,991
You are dating a joke

120
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:52,063
Or married to Joe or whatever with a joke

121
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:54,879
Who also skips over the theme song

122
00:07:55,135 --> 00:08:00,767
Tell him it was you I'm not going to follow up on that.

123
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:02,559
Feel free to lie to your partner

124
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:05,631
Building strong released

125
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:08,959
And now back to the Sound of Silence

126
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:10,239
Indeed hello darkness

127
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:11,519
Miss my old friends

128
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:13,567
I couldn't help but

129
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:15,103
Like I was

130
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:16,127
Active look okay

131
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:17,663
Beginning of the week

132
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:20,991
We had the rallies in DC and then I was kind of

133
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:23,295
Planning on this episode till I cover the

134
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:25,599
Very predictable and obvious

135
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:27,647
Reactions Alex would have to it

136
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:30,207
Today Thursday as

137
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:31,231
And I'm getting

138
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:33,535
Gametime episode

139
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:34,815
We got hit with some big news

140
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:38,143
Liberty Therrien

141
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:39,679
Aha on Twitter

142
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:44,287
Infowars Duck getting banned

143
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:47,103
Every to pour in for anyone to notice is there

144
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:53,503
David Knight announced that he was fired effective immediately from Infowars

145
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:54,271
Cowboy

146
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:58,111
Tdp's got to live in the end I don't know if that's

147
00:08:58,623 --> 00:09:00,927
That is the obvious thing that you would fix

148
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:07,327
Because David Knight has been on a bit of a public Vendetta against Steve pieczenik little bit who has been trying to convince

149
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:08,607
People that Infowars

150
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:11,167
That said the election was a grand sting operation

151
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:15,519
And David nice not having any other b*******

152
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:18,079
Fired for being inexplicably

153
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:19,359
A half-truth teller

154
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:24,991
Appropriately to that not his credit

155
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:26,271
He also

156
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:28,575
You know the last time we had Steve on

157
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:31,391
He said yes I believe Sandy Hook was a false flag

158
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:33,951
I will not agree with you about Las Vegas

159
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:38,047
So I don't know where his mind

160
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:42,911
B Big B big news and I don't want to I don't want to shoot on somebody when they're down

161
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:44,191
But I mean like

162
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:45,215
It's relevant

163
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:45,983
To re-enter

164
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:46,751
Crystal

165
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:48,287
Goodnight has been there

166
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:49,311
Forever

167
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:50,591
He's been there

168
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:53,151
Something like that

169
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:55,711
He has always been there through thick and

170
00:09:56,735 --> 00:09:58,015
Of so much

171
00:09:58,271 --> 00:09:59,039
Horrible bulshit

172
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:02,111
Went along with Alex's he got into Trump

173
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:05,183
Alex just remember the David Knight

174
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:09,023
Was there and he was like 5 years ago and then I just forgot

175
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:11,071
He's just so boring I don't

176
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:14,655
No I'm actually kind of conflicted I'm not entirely sure what I think

177
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:15,423
The quesadillas

178
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:20,287
Discuss this as as we go through the episode 2

179
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:21,055
What the 17th

180
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:22,335
We're going to start without

181
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:23,359
The conversation

182
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:24,383
Because

183
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:26,431
I think he knew he needed to get ahead of this

184
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:29,759
It's so he has fired David

185
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:32,063
At this point we are

186
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:34,623

First thing I want to say

190
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:42,303
The tank was a good idea

191
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:45,887
It was a good idea

192
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:55,359
Attack we're good more money then David Knight Kelly-Moore pills

193
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:57,407

Text Rob from Today Show

200
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:15,839
I don't like it myself as US president but this job is about as close as a kid

201
00:11:16,351 --> 00:11:17,887
Okay

202
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:19,679
I mean currently

203
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:22,239
Maybe maybe

204
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:25,567
Headlines

205
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:27,103
Yeah basically the president

206
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:28,383
Pretty close

207
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:30,687
Free clothes when you get down to it

208
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:32,223
I get lied to by weirdos

209
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:34,015
As a profession

210
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:35,551
I do like Stephen Miller

211
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:38,111
I kind of had assigned

212
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:40,159
That it was going to

213
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:41,183
To be something that Alex has

214
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:42,463
Because

215
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:43,999
David Knight has

216
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:45,279
Made this public he's

217
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:46,047
He's come out with it

218
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:47,327
Zoe Alex

219
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:48,863
Frames things

220
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:50,911
Is this way when he gets going on the

221
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:51,679
The show

222
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:52,447
On the 17th

223
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:53,215

224
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:55,519
You would like for the shout there was some special reports

225
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:56,543
Beginner guide

226

Willie huge announcement coming up

227
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:03,711
At the bottom of the hour about the future of Infowars

228
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:07,039
I am about this organization at restructuring

229
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:09,599
Announce today

230
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:13,183
I told folks about how

231
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:17,279
Serious sometimes

232
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:19,327
Infowars is

233
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:20,607
Fighting for it

234
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:25,215
Just like the rest of the country in the world

235
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:26,751
Point six billion dollars

236
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:29,055
The black lives matter got from the New World Order

237
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:35,455
Get it from you and we can't fight if you don't support the Redbox they weather

238
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:40,831
There's restructuring going on in the infowar there's demotion

239
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:44,159
Nothing really specific

240
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:47,231
They're just kind of like the insinuation that we're going to talk about what

241
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:50,303
The future is going to look like around here

242
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:52,095
Are the future

243
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:53,631
I grow weary of this

244
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:56,447
Quite honestly because we've been

245
00:12:56,703 --> 00:12:57,727
We've been on this

246
00:12:57,983 --> 00:12:58,495
Setrac

247
00:12:58,751 --> 00:13:00,543
Before we we've done some laps around

248
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:02,591
Grated

249
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:04,895
The move of firing

250
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:06,687
That one wasn't there

251
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:10,271
That's a big one that one stuff to undersell

252
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:13,599
That's tough to look at is like oh you're just blowing

253
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:16,927
Gunsmoke there's something there now whether it's

254
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:18,207
It's like a

255
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:18,975
Resources

256
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:23,071

Is it a Steve situation or is it to money

259
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:27,935
I don't know

260
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:28,703
I don't know

261
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:29,727
I can't tell

262
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:35,103
What's it what else is going on here Alex got anything to talk about other than your own don't b*******

263
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:41,503
Call me back on and get us out of the global system he did really a splendid job on many fronts

264
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:43,039
Made some big mistakes

265
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:47,135
And still with 34 days left if he levels of the American people

266
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:49,183
Resolute desk

267
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:50,207
Speeches

268
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:54,559
Washington peacefully

269
00:13:56,351 --> 00:13:58,911
Capital to

270
00:13:59,167 --> 00:14:01,471
Election fraud

271
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:03,007
Corporate media

272
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:07,359
Wo has a very good chance of holding up and back

273
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:10,175
Adjusted Department others land

274
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:11,455
The courage to do

275
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:12,479
The right thing

276
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:13,247
And prosecute

277
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:14,783
Alex is

278
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:16,063
Pretending that

279
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:18,111
Bunch of people could go March

280
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:24,511
And then the New World Order be like Plan B

281
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:28,607
First ten million people in one spot

282
00:14:28,863 --> 00:14:35,007
Plan B when they're over there he'll be perfect weapon

283
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:40,383
Bio weapon in

284
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:42,687
I cannot work

285
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:44,479
This is a super bioweapons

286
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:45,247
The plan b

287
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:50,879
Super Bowl weather

288
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:53,951
Just can't I can't get it up for this kind of thing

289
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:54,719
Sad he does

290
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:55,999
Believe it

291
00:14:56,255 --> 00:15:02,143
I can't I can't handle the guy trying to tell me that like we just need a bunch of people to March and then maybe

292
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:08,031
The cabal of people who've been planning this for thousands of years will be like oh no people

293
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:11,871
Already said that there's a plan B if all of them

294
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:12,639
If they manage

295
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:19,039
Do you like even if it get Trump back in office visit Plan B it's just everyone dies but it's a little less

296
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:21,599
Organize

297
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:22,879
How how

298
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:23,647
Why

299
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:24,671
What is this matter

300
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:28,511
I don't know but the idea of the devil who is been with Humanity

301
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:29,791
Since there were two

302
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:32,351
And now there are several billion of us

303
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:35,167
For him to be like woah 10 million is just too much

304
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:37,727
Ormeida it look I got to tell the NWO tobacco

305
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:43,615
Medically a little bit problematic for me that the New World Order would be doing

306
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:44,383
The devils

307
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:45,407
Bidding

308
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:49,759
Because the devil is told them that they

309
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:50,527
Should

310
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:51,551
And

311
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:53,087
I mean yeah

312
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:53,855
If the devil's I could

313
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:55,647
Who cares about 10 million people marching

314
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:58,975
It's no big deal I'll just keep going with their plans

315
00:15:59,231 --> 00:15:59,999
Devil's phone

316
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:01,279
Or does he

317
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:04,351
I don't know he seems really

318
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:06,399
Dissident domestic politics

319
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:15,103
The whole big world out there for the devil

320
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:16,127
This is

321
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:19,199
Is it stupid and it feels trivial even within Alex's own

322
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:20,991
Conspiracy that I just don't care

323
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:24,319
You get back to your b******* Alex

324
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:26,367
I want to hear more about your your situation

325
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:28,927
Infowars I'll give you the good news

326
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:31,487
Infowars has

327
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:35,839
325 x volumes on Saturday May 6th

328
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:38,399
That we've ever had except for right around the last election

329
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:39,935
Spinal reflex

330
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:41,727
We do not have

331
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:45,567
Guy

332
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:47,103
That

333
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:48,895
Except

334
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:49,919
Shows going

335
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:51,967
In the field

336
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:54,783
Kept

337
00:16:56,831 --> 00:16:58,111
To be able to have

338
00:16:58,367 --> 00:17:00,159
Finding 222 run this operation

339
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:02,719
Take care of shortfalls

340
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:06,047
The other

341
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:08,351
Things I have is as an emergency backup

342
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:10,655
And it wouldn't find this place

343
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:14,495
Everything

344
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:15,775
Cuz it was a big operation

345
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:26,271
I don't know about that

346
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:27,807
Also I think that's

347
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:28,831
It's called being over at

348
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:30,367
Send it

349
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:31,391
That's sad

350
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:32,415
You could

351
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:33,951
You could also put that bus

352
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:36,511
We should have

353
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:37,535
Scaled back

354
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:40,351
Long time ago

355
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:41,887
No reason to not have

356
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:44,959
Hank was a bad purchase

357
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:48,287
No need for that tank Studio looks

358
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:50,079
Great amazing

359
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:56,479
Point maybe too big for just one person to sit there and maybe a little off

360
00:17:56,735 --> 00:18:02,879
Ostentatious

361
00:18:03,135 --> 00:18:03,647

362
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:06,975
I don't like that I remember that anyway look

363
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:08,767
You need to buy his products

364
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:09,535
Because Alex needs

365
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:11,327
Money shorthand

366
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:14,143
You know what you need them to you need the product student

367
00:18:14,655 --> 00:18:16,191
Over here

368
00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:20,031
For his leg had some medical stuff

369
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:21,567
Went to the doctor

370
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:24,895
I want to play Monster a load

371
00:18:25,151 --> 00:18:26,175
Loti he didn't do it

372
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:28,223
Got tested again

373
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:28,991
On Monday

00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:30,783
Jerseys that look at that

375
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:32,319
Birthday

376
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:34,367
Look at my numbers at 1

377
00:18:41,023 --> 00:18:42,815
That's the type of things that are

378
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:44,863
Going on

379
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:51,007
You come through over and over again I keep telling you we can't keep operating

380
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:52,543
We can't keep doing this level

381
00:18:53,055 --> 00:18:54,079
If you don't support us

382
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:56,639
Forest email spread the word

383
00:18:57,151 --> 00:18:59,967
Your way

384
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:07,391
Klowdtv number one

385
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:09,439
Oann Newsmax

386
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:10,463
Pixar the worst

387
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:12,767
Thing that could happen for Alex

388
00:19:13,023 --> 00:19:15,839
The fact that those two outlets are doing

389
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:16,863
Slick s***

390
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:20,447
They have some sort of financing from mysterious

391
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:22,751
Source I'm sure that better than 90

392
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:24,543
18 year olds working in their room

393
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:26,847
The ability to

394
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:28,639
Pretend that their news

395
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:30,431
They don't act like Alex

396
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:31,967
Screaming about the devil

397
00:19:32,223 --> 00:19:34,527
They say the same s*** I absolutely

398
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:36,319
They have let her lie call David

399
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:39,135
Like

400
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:43,231
Editorial standards of Alex Monday. It's of a news thing

401
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:46,047
The worst thing ever for Alex he has no place in the market

402
00:19:46,303 --> 00:19:47,071
Good anymore once

403
00:19:47,327 --> 00:19:49,631
Unless he does something different as to Pivot

404
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:50,911
Or else like

405
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:52,447
It will just be

406
00:19:53,215 --> 00:19:57,823
I'm another one of them is that no one will plug because I suck

407
00:19:58,079 --> 00:19:58,847
Cuz I'm so toxic

408
00:19:59,359 --> 00:19:59,871
It's at

409
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:01,151
Funny I kind of think

410
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:02,175
Alex is

411
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:03,711
Confused by that

412
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:06,015
Cuz I really do think

413
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:07,551
That when he sees his set

414
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:08,831
And the way a show run

415
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:11,647
He's like this looks like a news organization

416
00:20:11,903 --> 00:20:13,183
You know he totally

417
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:14,207
He thinks that

418
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:16,767
So how can he look at oand Newsmax

419
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:17,535
To be like

420
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:18,559
They're just like me

421
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:20,607
You don't like is that wild

422
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:22,911
I don't think he watches anything other than

423
00:20:23,167 --> 00:20:26,495
Set the time for ignore the interest

424
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:29,055
I think it's actually kind of interesting that beat

425
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:29,823
Because

426
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:31,103
Those things exist

427
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:32,895
It's things like Newsmax Roan

428
00:20:33,407 --> 00:20:34,431
Like David naked

429
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:36,223
Easily get a job at either of them

430
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:37,503
Like babe

431
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:39,295
Accidentally created

432
00:20:39,551 --> 00:20:40,831
Employability

433
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:42,111
For the people

434
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:44,927
That works for Alex like right through ART Alex

435
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:47,999
You created a situation where he can't hold

436
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:54,143
People hostage working at Infowars anymore if you have aspirations to be a right-wing journalist like

437
00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:55,935
There are other option then

438
00:20:56,191 --> 00:20:56,703
Yeah

439
00:20:56,959 --> 00:20:57,983
Death Alex

440
00:20:58,239 --> 00:21:01,311
Y'all got news is Shroyer's not going anywhere

441
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:02,847
I don't think so even after

442
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:03,871
You know

443
00:21:04,127 --> 00:21:08,479
Nobody's hiring the evening even nuzback's is going to see Owen Shroyer walk in and be like

444
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:09,759
And you may turn around now

445
00:21:10,015 --> 00:21:12,319
I can't tell exactly from listen

446
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:16,159
Coming to this but it does appear that Owen is the only other person who

447
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:16,928
Survive the

448
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,232
Oh s***

449
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:20,768
Like straight up

450
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,816
We'll get to it

451
00:21:23,328 --> 00:21:25,888
Showing my cards too early

452
00:21:26,144 --> 00:21:30,240
We should know that Alex would be very clear that he's not quitting

453
00:21:31,264 --> 00:21:33,312
And so you know I said on Joe Rogan show

454
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:37,152
5 weeks ago I said I thought about retiring

455
00:21:38,176 --> 00:21:38,944
In the media.

456
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,760
That was just too ghetto Joan trying to act like he's this

457
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:43,040
Reluctant hero

458
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:49,440
I only

459
00:21:49,952 --> 00:21:50,976
Houston 5%

460
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,584
Basically no life other than this

461
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:57,376
All I do

462
00:21:58,144 --> 00:22:00,448
I still feel like I'm not doing enough but I'm not going to quit

463
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:01,728
I can't imagine

464
00:22:01,984 --> 00:22:04,288
And it being his wife and him being so bad

465
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:06,848
What are you putting

466
00:22:07,104 --> 00:22:07,616
Time-It 2

467
00:22:07,872 --> 00:22:08,384
I don't know

468
00:22:09,408 --> 00:22:09,920
I don't know what code

469
00:22:10,176 --> 00:22:10,944
Could he possibly

470
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:12,992
It in regards to the show

471
00:22:13,504 --> 00:22:17,088
Okay you've dedicated your life to this show you talk for

472
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:18,624
3 to 4 hours

473
00:22:19,136 --> 00:22:20,672
For being a very generous day

474
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:22,208
Door someone

475
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,488
Right right right

476
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:24,256
You don't

477
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:27,840
If you tell people that you read and I think something happened

478
00:22:28,864 --> 00:22:30,656
While you were holding a thing

479
00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:32,960
He reads headlines

480
00:22:33,216 --> 00:22:33,984
He sees that then

481
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,032
Become bring thoughts over

482
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:36,800
Reading would be

483
00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:41,664
The only thing I can imagine that would take a lot of time as maybe it requires like

484
00:22:42,432 --> 00:22:45,760
Expensive meditation or yoga in order to get into his life

485
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:46,784
Prophetic

486
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:47,808
Psychic

487
00:22:48,064 --> 00:22:53,440
Trantor has or whatever the headlines now

488
00:22:53,696 --> 00:22:56,000
Guy gets into some kind of a weird trance-state

489
00:22:56,256 --> 00:23:00,096
And then he reports on what the trance showed him about this

490
00:23:00,608 --> 00:23:04,448
This headline as opposed to reading that the article

491
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:05,472
Too much time

492
00:23:05,728 --> 00:23:06,752
How old is Mantra is

493
00:23:07,008 --> 00:23:07,520
Soros

494
00:23:08,032 --> 00:23:09,056
Alright

495
00:23:11,104 --> 00:23:13,152
Laura can't I just

496
00:23:13,408 --> 00:23:15,712
Can't imagine it doesn't need to practice

497
00:23:15,968 --> 00:23:18,272
Talkingshit he's really good at it

498
00:23:18,528 --> 00:23:19,040
Isaac

499
00:23:19,296 --> 00:23:20,064
Ecstatic at it.

500
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:23,904
Time is preparing any clearly doesn't

501
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:26,208
This is not the end

502
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,488
It is a new chapter

503
00:23:28,512 --> 00:23:31,072
What's been the greatest pleasure of my life 27 years on air

504
00:23:31,584 --> 00:23:32,608
Knowing all of you

505
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:36,448
And and nnnnn fighting the New World Order

506
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:38,240
I'm not going anywhere

507
00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:42,336
You know what I tell you that

508
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:45,408
The CIA follows us around in the FBI

509
00:23:45,664 --> 00:23:46,944
Servicenow

510
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:47,968
They, sit down

511
00:23:48,224 --> 00:23:50,528
Next Door restaurant

512
00:23:50,784 --> 00:23:53,856
Visit us at the hotel

513
00:23:57,952 --> 00:23:59,488
You want me arrested on Twitter

514
00:24:00,768 --> 00:24:02,048
That isn't me scared

515
00:24:02,304 --> 00:24:07,424
It's belying Infowars entering a new chapter of life

516
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,728
Embellishing probably more than lying

517
00:24:09,984 --> 00:24:11,520
Michael Hayden did tweet

518
00:24:11,776 --> 00:24:13,056
An agreement

519
00:24:13,312 --> 00:24:14,592
With somebody who tweeted that Alec

520
00:24:14,848 --> 00:24:15,616
Text be arrested

521
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:17,408
For his statement about Biden

522
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:19,968
At that rally over the weekend

523
00:24:23,808 --> 00:24:24,320
I don't know

524
00:24:24,832 --> 00:24:25,344
The new chapter

525
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:26,880
What is the new chapter

526
00:24:27,392 --> 00:24:27,904
What does that mean

527
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:28,928
What does that entail

528
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,976
Are you can sell it up

529
00:24:31,232 --> 00:24:31,744
With a song

530
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:32,512
Song title

531
00:24:33,024 --> 00:24:33,536
No more mr.

532
00:24:44,288 --> 00:24:45,312
Start

533
00:24:45,824 --> 00:24:46,336
With

534
00:24:47,104 --> 00:24:47,616
Not

535
00:24:50,944 --> 00:24:51,712
Not.

536
00:24:52,736 --> 00:24:53,504
Being delusional

537
00:24:54,528 --> 00:24:55,040
About

538
00:24:55,296 --> 00:24:56,576
Where we stand and what we

539
00:24:56,832 --> 00:24:57,344
We can do

540
00:24:59,136 --> 00:25:00,160
And the fact that I have this

541
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:00,928
Tenancy

542
00:25:03,232 --> 00:25:04,768
And I own operations

543
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,048
Because

544
00:25:08,608 --> 00:25:10,144
I'm so loyal even though

545
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,168
The point

546
00:25:12,448 --> 00:25:13,472
Operation not being able

547
00:25:14,496 --> 00:25:16,288
Up to this point you've been

548
00:25:16,544 --> 00:25:17,824
Mr. nice guy

549
00:25:19,104 --> 00:25:19,616
Speech

550
00:25:19,872 --> 00:25:21,408
I can only hear that like

551
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,200
Imagining him just

552
00:25:23,456 --> 00:25:25,248
Giving it directly to the Mir Aziz

553
00:25:25,504 --> 00:25:27,552
He's putting the Joker makeup on

554
00:25:27,808 --> 00:25:30,880
He's just giving this like no more mr. nice guy alright

555
00:25:31,392 --> 00:25:31,904
Little bit more Rouge

556
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:38,304
I've never met

557
00:25:41,376 --> 00:25:42,144
Release the Kraken

558
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:47,776
I don't know that guy never got out of that

559
00:25:48,032 --> 00:25:49,824
I'm so it looked a lot of people are gone

560
00:25:50,336 --> 00:25:52,128
And

561
00:25:54,944 --> 00:25:58,272
There's some other people that you might have got got a listening

562
00:25:58,528 --> 00:26:00,064
I didn't force that aren't around anymore

563
00:26:01,856 --> 00:26:04,416
Pleasure you I'm going to work harder the fight against the ruler

564
00:26:04,672 --> 00:26:05,440
Beautiful

565
00:26:05,696 --> 00:26:06,976
Carter

566
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:10,560
But I've already explained to you

567
00:26:13,376 --> 00:26:14,400
Millie Weaver

568
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:21,312
God bless her

569
00:26:21,824 --> 00:26:22,336
It's okay

570
00:26:22,848 --> 00:26:23,616
Dilaudid

571
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:26,944
I like the idea that Alex

572
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:30,016
Just trying to pretend that he didn't fire her for shadowgate

573
00:26:30,272 --> 00:26:30,784
Modbee

574
00:26:32,064 --> 00:26:33,088
Could you make up all this stuff

575
00:26:33,344 --> 00:26:39,488
When I literally said I don't get into that stuff it's a scary this weirdo guy

576
00:26:39,744 --> 00:26:41,280
From your film showed up at my store

577
00:26:41,536 --> 00:26:45,376
Studio and then was talking about Rodger Stone in ways that I don't appreciate

578
00:26:48,448 --> 00:26:50,240
His finances

579
00:26:52,288 --> 00:26:52,800
That she's making up

580
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:54,080
Yeah bitlife

581
00:26:54,336 --> 00:26:54,848
Because of things

582
00:26:55,104 --> 00:26:59,200
In finances and the difficulties that Alex is in does the situation he's had to

583
00:26:59,456 --> 00:27:00,992
Backup backup

584
00:27:01,248 --> 00:27:04,064
There were people like Millie there were people like Kaitlin Bennett

585
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,088
But he was funding

586
00:27:05,344 --> 00:27:06,112
And now he can't

587
00:27:06,368 --> 00:27:07,136
He didn't do that anymore

588
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:10,464
34 years ago and I still owe him money I was funding

589
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:11,744
Dozens of organization

590
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:13,536
Doesn't the roofer.

591
00:27:14,048 --> 00:27:16,352
I'm taking the money you said ispine product

592
00:27:21,728 --> 00:27:22,752
I down to funding

593
00:27:23,264 --> 00:27:26,080
Three or four organizations outside of our own operation now

594
00:27:33,248 --> 00:27:33,760
But

595
00:27:34,272 --> 00:27:36,576
Everybody said she hears me say that you don't think I'm serious

596
00:27:36,832 --> 00:27:37,344
So

597
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:39,136
Organize

598
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:44,768
They only are four hours a day so is only 3 hours a day

599
00:27:48,352 --> 00:27:48,864
Because there's

600
00:27:49,888 --> 00:27:51,424
They're not the funds but not the money

601
00:27:51,936 --> 00:27:53,984
Reorganize some of the other shows

602
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,776
And then revamping the relaunch him

603
00:27:56,032 --> 00:27:57,056
Because

604
00:27:58,848 --> 00:27:59,360
Never give up

605
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:01,152
But I can

606
00:28:01,408 --> 00:28:01,920
Get out

607
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:04,224
Speckled horse the horses will run

608
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:06,272
And Ron and Ron tiller

609
00:28:06,528 --> 00:28:07,808
Yeah he's okay he's like a horse

610
00:28:08,064 --> 00:28:09,856
With his heart

611
00:28:10,368 --> 00:28:11,904
Well I'm about to blow up

612
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:13,184
Keep going

613
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,208
So

614
00:28:15,232 --> 00:28:16,000
From that cliff

615
00:28:16,256 --> 00:28:17,792
What I take away is that Alexa

616
00:28:18,048 --> 00:28:19,328
Countdown with Deanna Lorraine

617
00:28:19,584 --> 00:28:20,352
A robber baron

618
00:28:20,864 --> 00:28:21,632
Over

619
00:28:21,888 --> 00:28:23,424
After that

620
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:25,728
Sorry Byron Alex is going to be on

621
00:28:25,984 --> 00:28:27,008
Still and Owen

622
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:32,640
Conspicuous in its absence from that list is the only other show and that's David Knight show

623
00:28:32,896 --> 00:28:36,224
These shows

624
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,504
Spell obviously

625
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,040
According to

626
00:28:39,296 --> 00:28:40,832
Fortnite's Twitter you got fired

627
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:43,136
With somebody else

628
00:28:43,392 --> 00:28:49,536
I guess he wants to bring in a younger crowd so you know 11 or 12 year old video games

629
00:28:49,792 --> 00:28:51,840
Probably who is Godiva

630
00:28:52,096 --> 00:28:54,144
Play Electric

631
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,680
Harrison Smith is

632
00:28:55,936 --> 00:28:56,960
Is probably the best

633
00:28:57,216 --> 00:29:02,848
They have there and that's bad

634
00:29:04,128 --> 00:29:04,640
You can wear shades

635
00:29:04,896 --> 00:29:06,688
You don't need to ask

636
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,504
So

637
00:29:10,016 --> 00:29:11,040
Like

638
00:29:11,296 --> 00:29:15,136
I think that this metaphor to is a little bit rough and I don't appreciate it

639
00:29:15,392 --> 00:29:19,232
Alex talking about you know you could read your horse and he was running until your heart gives out

640
00:29:19,488 --> 00:29:22,048
David Knight had a heart attack last year

641
00:29:22,304 --> 00:29:23,840
And then he came back to work

642
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:26,656
Passionate about this s***

643
00:29:27,168 --> 00:29:27,936
That's very funny

644
00:29:29,472 --> 00:29:31,776
I don't want to be this guy

645
00:29:32,032 --> 00:29:36,896
Giving a s*** when it's not my time to give it a rich but like David Knight gave a lot

646
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:38,432
He did

647
00:29:38,688 --> 00:29:40,992
And we are now a couple weeks

648
00:29:41,248 --> 00:29:41,760
Before Christmas

649
00:29:42,016 --> 00:29:42,528
Haha

650
00:29:43,552 --> 00:29:44,320
Markiplier

651
00:29:44,832 --> 00:29:50,976
Absolutely that's so bad come on come on everybody

652
00:29:51,232 --> 00:29:52,512
Feel bad for Bob Cratchit

653
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:54,816
What is when did they think about how

654
00:29:55,328 --> 00:29:55,840
Screwed

655
00:29:56,096 --> 00:29:57,376
Would like a f****** horse

656
00:29:57,632 --> 00:30:00,704
Who is going to steal everybody's money until his heart gave out

657
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:05,056
Don't be thinking about Scrooge okay Dirty Man

658
00:30:05,312 --> 00:30:06,336
You want them dirty

659
00:30:06,592 --> 00:30:08,384
He couldn't wait until the new year

660
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:10,944
I just

661
00:30:11,456 --> 00:30:15,040
I just want I just hope that David Knight is overwhelmed by not like

662
00:30:15,296 --> 00:30:16,320
Sadness or

663
00:30:16,576 --> 00:30:17,600
Grad or like

664
00:30:18,112 --> 00:30:19,904
Anything other than just like

665
00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:23,488
I am so stupid for coming back after that f****** heart attack

666
00:30:23,744 --> 00:30:28,096
Well I should never have f****** done that it was slightly different hope and that is that I hope

667
00:30:28,352 --> 00:30:31,168
It gets ugly

668
00:30:31,424 --> 00:30:32,960
Like nothing negative

669
00:30:33,216 --> 00:30:35,264
I hope you kept some receipts

670
00:30:35,776 --> 00:30:38,848
I hope there's something real fun

671
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,384
Oh yeah

672
00:30:42,944 --> 00:30:43,712
Alex's the force

673
00:30:43,968 --> 00:30:44,736
Adidas running shoes

674
00:30:44,992 --> 00:30:46,016
You need a break

675
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:48,576
Any good horse will run till it blows

676
00:30:49,856 --> 00:30:51,648
You keep running horse it'll go to Lodi

677
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:53,184
Angie

678
00:30:54,976 --> 00:30:57,536
Metaphysically but also physically got to that point

679
00:31:00,096 --> 00:31:01,120
I can't stop working

680
00:31:01,376 --> 00:31:02,400
I've got to take a week off

681
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:04,960
Got to turn everything off

682
00:31:05,472 --> 00:31:06,240
Got to do it

683
00:31:09,312 --> 00:31:11,616
Because I don't smoke coming out of the race car engine

684
00:31:11,872 --> 00:31:12,896
You got to pull over again

685
00:31:14,688 --> 00:31:17,504
I got to put some oil in there

686
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,808
Put oil in the horse

687
00:31:20,064 --> 00:31:21,344
Just went to

688
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:22,112
DC

689
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:23,648
Just took a

690
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:24,672
Took a trip to

691
00:31:24,928 --> 00:31:25,440
DC

692
00:31:25,696 --> 00:31:26,720
Now that was work

693
00:31:26,976 --> 00:31:27,488
That was work

694
00:31:27,744 --> 00:31:28,768
Related

695
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,848
Take a week off Alex

696
00:31:43,104 --> 00:31:43,872
Please

697
00:31:44,128 --> 00:31:45,920
I was wondering like what

698
00:31:46,176 --> 00:31:47,200
Bisquick

699
00:31:47,456 --> 00:31:48,480
Confuse the hell out of

700
00:31:49,504 --> 00:31:51,296
Subscribe to his last straw was

701
00:31:51,552 --> 00:31:53,344
Okay it's something that doesn't make any sense

702
00:31:54,368 --> 00:31:55,648
Your support

703
00:31:55,904 --> 00:31:58,464
And I love you and I appreciate you and I and I

704
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:01,536
The last straw was this morning I got up and I saw this number

705
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:04,352
Billion

706
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:09,984
When you go in a coffee shop like Starbucks right where they said give it

707
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:13,056
Directions to communist of the globalist and Soros collecting money

708
00:32:19,968 --> 00:32:22,784
That was a few months ago that was for billion that I read that gotten

709
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:28,672
That's all just miss misinterpretations of the active blue stuff

710
00:32:28,928 --> 00:32:30,208
Yeah I don't know why

711
00:32:30,464 --> 00:32:33,024
Black lives matter getting a certain amount of money

712
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:35,072
Would be the last straw for him

713
00:32:35,584 --> 00:32:37,888
Cuz it doesn't materially affect what key

714
00:32:38,144 --> 00:32:41,984
He's doing at all if I understand correctly I wrote this down as I was track

715
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:46,080
Alright so I wrote down first BLM raised 10 billion and then

716
00:32:46,592 --> 00:32:48,896
So I fired David Knight

717
00:32:51,968 --> 00:32:58,112
Is that that is that the event statement that I think we're going for here.

718
00:32:58,368 --> 00:33:02,720
There's a weird feeling of it but I think if you distill it down even more it's like

719
00:33:03,232 --> 00:33:06,304
I saw that black lives matter made 10 billion dollars

720
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:10,400
I'm not making close to that and it pisses me off

721
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:11,936
So I'm going to fire David

722
00:33:13,216 --> 00:33:18,592
Lorraine

723
00:33:18,848 --> 00:33:19,616
Just kind of like a temp

724
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:20,640
She's an independent

725
00:33:20,896 --> 00:33:26,272
She was there on a little bit of a assignment or whatever

726
00:33:26,528 --> 00:33:29,088
She was there for long-term

727
00:33:29,344 --> 00:33:30,624
I think

728
00:33:31,392 --> 00:33:32,928
I just yeah I don't know

729
00:33:33,184 --> 00:33:33,696
I'm very

730
00:33:33,952 --> 00:33:38,048
Conflicted because there's two sides of this that I think Goodwin

731
00:33:38,304 --> 00:33:40,096
Is like the

732
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:43,680
David Knight has run afoul of Steve pieczenik in a very serious way

733
00:33:43,936 --> 00:33:45,216
And that is something that

734
00:33:45,984 --> 00:33:47,520
It's hard to have in-house

735
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:52,128
I have somebody who is your intro show on your network

736
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,664
Right before you

737
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:55,456
Who's saying that one of your expertise

738
00:33:55,712 --> 00:33:56,736
Is a piece of s*** liar

739
00:33:58,016 --> 00:34:00,832
Going to be tough to maintain status quo

740
00:34:01,344 --> 00:34:02,880
And you're a media Outlet

741
00:34:03,136 --> 00:34:03,904
That is built in

742
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:05,440
Entirely around Bombay

743
00:34:06,208 --> 00:34:10,560
So it seems fairly simple to be like okay well we've got the most boring man ever

744
00:34:11,072 --> 00:34:11,584
And we've got

745
00:34:12,096 --> 00:34:13,376
The most bombastic liar ever

746
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:19,520
I think we're going to go with the most Boombastic liar yeah yeah and also you can't really have

747
00:34:19,776 --> 00:34:20,800
A whole lot of

748
00:34:21,056 --> 00:34:22,592
Stability in

749
00:34:22,848 --> 00:34:23,872
Keeping

750
00:34:24,384 --> 00:34:25,152
Keeping people

751
00:34:26,944 --> 00:34:27,456
Auden gay

752
00:34:28,224 --> 00:34:30,016
I guess you gave done engage

753
00:34:30,528 --> 00:34:31,552
Real people

754
00:34:31,808 --> 00:34:32,320
Actively can

755
00:34:32,576 --> 00:34:35,136
Assuming your material be engaging with it

756
00:34:35,392 --> 00:34:36,416
And haven't even

757
00:34:36,672 --> 00:34:40,512
Might be like Steve pieczenik the f****** liar

758
00:34:40,768 --> 00:34:42,816
Why does why does David Knight

759
00:34:43,072 --> 00:34:43,840
Think that he

760
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:47,680
Why doesn't Alex not

761
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,496
Too complicated and

762
00:34:50,752 --> 00:34:53,568
You run the risk of kick-starting like

763
00:34:53,824 --> 00:34:57,920
Critical thinking in your listeners yoga absolutely not

764
00:34:58,176 --> 00:34:58,688
I stick with picture

765
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,528
That was a little bit ago there's a couple weeks

766
00:35:02,784 --> 00:35:03,808
Tagalog

767
00:35:04,064 --> 00:35:05,088
No

768
00:35:05,856 --> 00:35:07,136
Draw causal link

769
00:35:07,392 --> 00:35:09,184
Here and Alex is saying that it's

770
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,208
Because of money

771
00:35:10,464 --> 00:35:10,976
Sure

772
00:35:11,232 --> 00:35:15,072
Now the only things that are gone are the night

773
00:35:15,328 --> 00:35:15,840
Show witch

774
00:35:16,096 --> 00:35:18,656
Obviously sucked the evening show that no one

775
00:35:18,912 --> 00:35:19,936
Cared about OverWatch

776
00:35:20,192 --> 00:35:24,544
They canceled when Alex went to DC because they didn't have the crew to run it anyway

777
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,592
Already like a

778
00:35:26,848 --> 00:35:28,896
Secondary tertiary thought for them

779
00:35:29,152 --> 00:35:30,432
David Knight show

780
00:35:30,688 --> 00:35:32,736
Paper easily could be monetary budget

781
00:35:33,248 --> 00:35:34,528
Constraints

782
00:35:34,784 --> 00:35:37,344
I can also see a possible world where Alex was like

783
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:39,136
Buckeye got to get rid of David Knight

784
00:35:39,392 --> 00:35:40,416
It's just not working out

785
00:35:40,672 --> 00:35:41,696
This is an untenable

786
00:35:41,952 --> 00:35:42,464
Situation

787
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:44,000
How can we fund-raised on

788
00:35:44,512 --> 00:35:46,048
How can I drive

789
00:35:46,304 --> 00:35:46,816
Sales

790
00:35:47,328 --> 00:35:47,840
With

791
00:35:48,096 --> 00:35:48,864
Getting rid of

792
00:35:50,912 --> 00:35:53,728
I don't know I can't say I have no f****** idea

793
00:35:53,984 --> 00:35:55,264
None of it seems good

794
00:35:56,288 --> 00:35:57,056
Seems like this is a

795
00:35:57,312 --> 00:35:59,616
No I wouldn't look at any of these circumstances and be like

796
00:35:59,872 --> 00:36:00,640
I'm going to invest

797
00:36:00,896 --> 00:36:02,176
Send this busy

798
00:36:02,688 --> 00:36:08,064
Businesses model looks good I'm going to wait till it hits Rock Bottom first

799
00:36:11,648 --> 00:36:14,208
It's unclear because last clip here from the seven

800
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:16,512
Now it's kind of implies that

801
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:20,352
The Christmas sale will determine the future of until

802
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:22,144
Peculiar Christmas shop

803
00:36:22,656 --> 00:36:23,936
Infowarsstore.com

804
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:24,960
Will expand

805
00:36:25,472 --> 00:36:26,496
But if you don't look at

806
00:36:28,288 --> 00:36:29,824
Reassessing right now

807
00:36:30,336 --> 00:36:31,872
Add Infowars is control

808
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:33,152
I have a big

809
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:34,432
Offensive

810
00:36:36,992 --> 00:36:38,016
Or just the next event

811
00:36:38,528 --> 00:36:44,416
I promise you this will go out fiery Inferno of Liberty in a peaceful

812
00:36:44,672 --> 00:36:46,720
Operation

813
00:36:46,976 --> 00:36:47,488
Peaceful

814
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:48,512
Weasel

815
00:36:49,024 --> 00:36:53,632
I do take offense of a couple times are in a fiery blaze of

816
00:36:54,912 --> 00:36:57,472
Don't worry I would like one last image of

817
00:36:57,728 --> 00:37:03,872
Infowars to be Alex standing in the studio as Everything Burns around him with his arm

818
00:37:04,384 --> 00:37:05,664
Outstretched his head facing in

819
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:08,480
Screaming into the sky I think that's how he's got to go out

820
00:37:08,736 --> 00:37:10,272
Sure write that last image

821
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:11,040
I don't want to die

822
00:37:12,064 --> 00:37:15,136
Big Bertha Life movie

823
00:37:15,392 --> 00:37:17,440
Dark Harry Oldman in the

824
00:37:17,696 --> 00:37:22,048
Professional whenever he lays eyes are all bloodshot and he's screaming to this guy

825
00:37:22,816 --> 00:37:27,936
Play this last year from the 17th I have one more but it

826
00:37:28,192 --> 00:37:30,752
It's just sort of like indicative of like me losing my page

827
00:37:31,264 --> 00:37:33,568
Alex and why working at now jump back

828
00:37:33,824 --> 00:37:34,336
To the 16th

829
00:37:34,592 --> 00:37:35,360
To see what thing

830
00:37:35,616 --> 00:37:36,128
We're like

831
00:37:36,384 --> 00:37:37,152
24-hours

832
00:37:37,408 --> 00:37:40,992
Malik spending the beginning of his show talking about how

833
00:37:41,248 --> 00:37:42,272
Dyer s*** is

834
00:37:42,528 --> 00:37:43,552

Andres

836

Manuel Lopez

837
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:49,952
Is a socialist

838
00:37:54,816 --> 00:37:56,608
By that I mean the popular socialist

839
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:59,680
Is actually trying to get

840
00:38:00,192 --> 00:38:02,496
Corporations actually not

841
00:38:03,264 --> 00:38:04,800
How to do that model long-term butt

842
00:38:05,056 --> 00:38:06,080
Sir Alex

843
00:38:06,336 --> 00:38:09,920
Alex has decided that he likes of the president-elect

844
00:38:10,176 --> 00:38:11,200
Mexico because they

845
00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:13,248
There was some comments about covid

846
00:38:13,504 --> 00:38:17,344
Precautions that Alex enjoyed

847
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:19,136
What is a real sexual

848
00:38:19,392 --> 00:38:22,720
Ever

849
00:38:22,976 --> 00:38:26,560
You hate people who don't understand socialism who think the

850
00:38:27,072 --> 00:38:30,912
God I hate you hate people who you decide or socialist

851
00:38:32,192 --> 00:38:37,056
So are we jumping we are there any signs

852
00:38:37,824 --> 00:38:39,872
Are there any indications that we can get from the sea

853
00:38:40,128 --> 00:38:40,640
16th and Blake

854
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:47,296
A day later never had more money than we had right now

855
00:38:47,552 --> 00:38:48,576
We're just so f***

856
00:38:48,832 --> 00:38:49,600
King flush anyways

857
00:38:49,856 --> 00:38:51,392
We'll see how it goes tomorrow

858
00:38:51,648 --> 00:38:54,976
So we start with Alex

859
00:38:56,256 --> 00:38:58,816
America and the rest of the world is under globalist

860
00:38:59,584 --> 00:39:00,864
Intech Siege

861
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:02,656
Corporate planetary takeover

862
00:39:06,752 --> 00:39:07,776
And make us obsolete

863
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,080
Lee Von mises Institute

864
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:12,128
Is highly respect

865
00:39:14,176 --> 00:39:14,944
With some of the top

866
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:15,968
Academic

867
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:18,272
Researchers Economist in the world

868
00:39:18,528 --> 00:39:21,344
Then come out a big article that's on infowars.com

869
00:39:23,904 --> 00:39:24,672
Where they say

870
00:39:25,184 --> 00:39:26,208
This is a

871
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:27,232
Dystopic

872
00:39:28,256 --> 00:39:28,768
Tech

873
00:39:31,328 --> 00:39:32,864
Bio / digital

874
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:33,632
Technocracy

875
00:39:33,888 --> 00:39:39,776
Mises Institute is not super well-respected there is like hardcore libertarian

876
00:39:43,872 --> 00:39:48,736
They're great one of the articles that I covered from their website was a defense

877
00:39:48,992 --> 00:39:51,040
Of not feeding your children

878
00:39:51,296 --> 00:39:56,160
Because you don't have positive responsibilities towards people exactly

879
00:39:56,672 --> 00:40:01,280
Yeah that they're cool Libertarians

880
00:40:01,536 --> 00:40:02,048
Jephthah

881
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:03,072
Just a s***

882
00:40:03,584 --> 00:40:06,400
Like if you're writing the in defense of not feeding your own kid

883
00:40:06,656 --> 00:40:09,216
You're just a s*******

884
00:40:09,472 --> 00:40:11,264
You're also not going to not

885
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:12,032
Feed your child

886
00:40:12,288 --> 00:40:17,152
You're doing this is some kind of a weird mentally intellectual masturbation

887
00:40:17,408 --> 00:40:18,944
But Alex

888
00:40:19,456 --> 00:40:24,576
Not too long ago was talking about how being a Libertarian was the stupidest thing you've ever done

889
00:40:24,832 --> 00:40:26,112
The Beast

890
00:40:26,368 --> 00:40:27,392
But they're real libertarian

891
00:40:27,648 --> 00:40:29,440
The smartest thing you

892
00:40:29,696 --> 00:40:30,464
Convey

893
00:40:30,976 --> 00:40:31,488
Barnes

894
00:40:32,256 --> 00:40:32,768
He shows camp

895
00:40:34,816 --> 00:40:36,096
24 hours earlier

896
00:40:36,864 --> 00:40:37,888
Lawyer

897
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:41,216

He's in liaison the White House

899
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:46,080
I can tell you that

900
00:40:47,616 --> 00:40:48,128
Why

901
00:40:48,384 --> 00:40:50,688
Can you tell me that he would care now

902
00:40:50,944 --> 00:40:52,224
Doesn't care that's why

903
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:55,040
If he doesn't want that no no

904
00:40:56,064 --> 00:41:02,208
Why would you tell me that this is private but Barnes is working with

905
00:41:04,256 --> 00:41:08,096
But the White House is okay so the White House is fine but you know

906
00:41:08,352 --> 00:41:09,888
And he personally asked

907
00:41:10,144 --> 00:41:16,032
There's no show the evening cancelled

Barnes has been not doing this show it's

912
00:41:23,456 --> 00:41:24,224
Going to come to an end

913
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:25,504
Sure

914
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:28,064
A pretty abrupt abrupt

915
00:41:28,832 --> 00:41:29,600
Speaking of which

916
00:41:29,856 --> 00:41:30,880
This seemed abrupt

917
00:41:31,648 --> 00:41:32,928
Here's the big news

918
00:41:33,696 --> 00:41:35,232
Where the coverage start the next segment

919
00:41:38,048 --> 00:41:39,072

Atwater Republican to Chinese payroll for a long time

921
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:49,568
Mitch McConnell's bad finally it's been so long since we've remembered how may

922
00:41:49,824 --> 00:41:55,967
How many people are bad Dan Mitch McConnell has recognized in election that matters

923
00:41:56,223 --> 00:42:00,063
I remember all these things about him or I just going to make up a diesel

924
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:04,159
That's great

925
00:42:04,415 --> 00:42:06,719
Absolutely Alex McConnell is a billion

926
00:42:06,975 --> 00:42:07,743
Go after him

927
00:42:08,511 --> 00:42:10,815
Hell yeah

928
00:42:11,327 --> 00:42:13,375
McConnell

00:42:16,703 --> 00:42:19,519
We told you Amy Coleman bear at every told you Kavanaugh

930
00:42:20,031 --> 00:42:21,055
Amy told you all

931
00:42:21,823 --> 00:42:23,359
We're going to press

932
00:42:24,895 --> 00:42:25,919
Because

933
00:42:26,431 --> 00:42:27,199
Out of the swamp

934
00:42:29,759 --> 00:42:30,527
Yep

935
00:42:31,039 --> 00:42:35,647
You told them that the only reason to stick with trouble with so he could get those

936
00:42:40,511 --> 00:42:41,535
Just too long ago

937
00:42:41,791 --> 00:42:46,911
Brian Cavanaugh all about Cavanaugh

938
00:42:47,423 --> 00:42:51,007
Alex was so in favor that is if he was squeezed himself

939
00:42:51,263 --> 00:42:52,287
Culmination

940
00:42:53,567 --> 00:42:55,871
It was a little more confusing the Barrett

941
00:42:56,127 --> 00:42:56,639
Nomination

942
00:42:56,895 --> 00:42:57,407
Because

943
00:42:57,663 --> 00:43:00,735
Yeah you did have barns coming in and saying this is a really bad idea

944
00:43:00,991 --> 00:43:01,759
They shouldn't go this route

945
00:43:02,271 --> 00:43:04,575
And Alex having to dance around and

946
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:07,135
Support her domination

947
00:43:07,391 --> 00:43:08,415
He was in favor of it

948
00:43:08,671 --> 00:43:09,951
Catholics

949
00:43:10,463 --> 00:43:13,535
I don't like Catholic somebody else like I think she's great.

950
00:43:13,791 --> 00:43:17,631
But they're all villains now man

951
00:43:17,887 --> 00:43:19,423
We got a lot of new feelings

952
00:43:19,679 --> 00:43:20,447
Sloughing or Alex

953
00:43:20,703 --> 00:43:23,519
Fight amongst yourselves I want to make you hurt each other more

954
00:43:23,775 --> 00:43:25,311
So Rodger Stone

955
00:43:25,567 --> 00:43:27,615
Bongo came on

956
00:43:27,871 --> 00:43:28,895
I'm broke some gigantic

957
00:43:29,151 --> 00:43:29,919
Tech news

958
00:43:31,455 --> 00:43:32,479
Man boats

959
00:43:32,991 --> 00:43:34,527
North Korea arrived

960
00:43:38,879 --> 00:43:40,927
Ripen main main

961
00:43:41,183 --> 00:43:41,951
United States

962
00:43:42,975 --> 00:43:43,487
Different

963
00:43:43,743 --> 00:43:44,767
Situation

964
00:43:45,791 --> 00:43:49,119
Carnivore COPD of electoral college brawl in Congress

965
00:43:51,423 --> 00:43:52,703
Trump.is electors

966
00:43:53,215 --> 00:43:56,031
They seated are they lock the real electors out of the state houses

967
00:43:56,287 --> 00:43:58,847
We're supposed to just go along with this and not let the president

968
00:43:59,103 --> 00:44:00,127
America

969
00:44:00,895 --> 00:44:01,919
Press their attack

970
00:44:05,759 --> 00:44:06,271
Screwed

971
00:44:06,527 --> 00:44:07,807
You're so far by mostly governor

972
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:09,343
Because they're all bunch of cowards

973
00:44:10,367 --> 00:44:13,439
Brasstacks EC mathematics possible

974
00:44:13,695 --> 00:44:14,719
In all those States

975
00:44:15,231 --> 00:44:16,511
We're Trump's wedding.

976
00:44:16,767 --> 00:44:18,047
23456

977
00:44:18,559 --> 00:44:20,351
And then as soon as they close the pole

978
00:44:22,143 --> 00:44:23,423
Food delivery vehicles United

979
00:44:23,935 --> 00:44:24,959
Chinese men

980
00:44:25,215 --> 00:44:27,519
Run into these big containers

981
00:44:27,775 --> 00:44:29,055
And then inside we have the footage

982
00:44:29,311 --> 00:44:32,127
Other workers in their advantage fast as they can

983
00:44:33,151 --> 00:44:38,271
You have a Chinese government plane

984
00:44:39,039 --> 00:44:41,343
Flying out of China Landing

985
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:47,743
Boxes of balance so now the Chinese government is sending their own planes with Charter numbers

986
00:44:47,999 --> 00:44:50,047
Right at arriving with ballots on election

987
00:44:50,303 --> 00:44:50,815
Convey

988
00:44:51,071 --> 00:44:55,679
So I to the North Korean Buck boat like a

989
00:44:55,935 --> 00:44:56,447
Backup

990
00:44:56,959 --> 00:45:02,847
Okay we'll send the boats in like March of this year and

991
00:45:03,103 --> 00:45:06,431
China going to have the plan to airlift them in and everything but went but

992
00:45:06,687 --> 00:45:10,271
Worst comes to worst the boats will be in Maine in November here's what I'm

993
00:45:11,039 --> 00:45:11,807
I'm thinking

994
00:45:12,063 --> 00:45:13,855
Let the Chinese planes brought in

995
00:45:14,111 --> 00:45:14,623
Pallets

996
00:45:14,879 --> 00:45:15,903
Big boxes of ballots

997
00:45:16,159 --> 00:45:16,671
Provider

998
00:45:17,695 --> 00:45:19,487
Okay now the boats

999
00:45:19,743 --> 00:45:20,511
We're Rogue

1000
00:45:20,767 --> 00:45:26,911
They were crazy trailer for Jorgensen

1001
00:45:27,167 --> 00:45:31,263
They were carrying down-ballot

1002
00:45:31,519 --> 00:45:32,543
For the 26

1003
00:45:32,799 --> 00:45:33,823
Team election

1004
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:34,847
And the North Koreans

1005
00:45:35,103 --> 00:45:35,615
Just got to

1006
00:45:36,383 --> 00:45:39,455
That would make more sense

1007
00:45:40,735 --> 00:45:41,247
I would make

1008
00:45:43,807 --> 00:45:45,343
I just feel like it's a silly

1009
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:46,367
And

1010
00:45:46,623 --> 00:45:47,647
Need a lot more

1011
00:45:48,159 --> 00:45:48,927
I approve of this witch

1012
00:45:49,183 --> 00:45:50,975
Alex is not forthcoming with

1013
00:45:51,487 --> 00:45:53,791
But something it is also

1014
00:45:54,047 --> 00:45:54,559
Not surprised

1015
00:45:54,815 --> 00:45:55,839
Alex

1016
00:45:56,095 --> 00:45:59,167
Want to do over

1017
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:01,983
Electoral College certification

1018
00:46:02,751 --> 00:46:03,263
Yes

1019
00:46:09,151 --> 00:46:09,919
X24 press

1020
00:46:10,431 --> 00:46:10,943
4 years

1021
00:46:11,455 --> 00:46:12,479
Get the f*** out of

1022
00:46:13,503 --> 00:46:14,271
Pants Paul Paul

1023
00:46:14,527 --> 00:46:15,551
Call Penn State will be good

1024
00:46:15,807 --> 00:46:16,319
Okay

1025
00:46:17,343 --> 00:46:19,135
Call pimp

1026
00:46:19,391 --> 00:46:20,159
Paul Pence

1027
00:46:20,415 --> 00:46:23,231
Aspire the masses

1028
00:46:27,583 --> 00:46:29,631
Oh my God yeah you want Rand Paul back

1029
00:46:29,887 --> 00:46:31,935
Fun how interesting

1030
00:46:32,191 --> 00:46:33,727
Pence can't be president because

1031
00:46:33,983 --> 00:46:35,775
Nobody wants to live in a world where we have to

1032
00:46:36,031 --> 00:46:38,591
To call his wife the first mother that's just not happen

1033
00:46:39,103 --> 00:46:39,615
It's just not happy

1034
00:46:39,871 --> 00:46:43,967
Grandpa you had your chance Alex you turned your back on him for Trump

1035
00:46:44,223 --> 00:46:45,503
You know that it's over

1036
00:46:45,759 --> 00:46:47,295
We all watch that happen

1037
00:46:47,551 --> 00:46:51,391
Raymond isn't like Joe Rogan where you can turn your back on him and he'll accept

1038
00:46:51,647 --> 00:46:53,183
Kept you once more no I know B

1039
00:46:53,439 --> 00:46:54,463
Because he refuses to

1040
00:46:54,719 --> 00:46:55,231
Debate me and

1041
00:46:55,487 --> 00:46:56,511
That's the only thing

1042
00:46:57,279 --> 00:46:58,559
So Robert Barnes

1043
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:02,911
For another couple hours of the election countdown

1044
00:47:03,423 --> 00:47:03,935
What is on

1045
00:47:04,191 --> 00:47:07,519
And he wants you to know that he also thinks that Mitch McConnell is a traitor

1046
00:47:08,543 --> 00:47:09,311
DF

1047
00:47:09,823 --> 00:47:11,359
Is it leads an inference

1048
00:47:11,615 --> 00:47:12,895
All along these

1049
00:47:13,151 --> 00:47:14,431
The people are undermining the president

1050
00:47:14,943 --> 00:47:15,455
And now

1051
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:24,159
It was Mitch McConnell all along betraying and undermining

1052
00:47:24,415 --> 00:47:25,439
Sabotaging the president

1053
00:47:25,695 --> 00:47:26,975
It's not a coincidence

1054
00:47:27,231 --> 00:47:31,071
Is Attorney General

1055
00:47:32,607 --> 00:47:33,119
Texas lawsuit

1056
00:47:40,287 --> 00:47:42,847
Yeah I want that too

1057
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:45,663
Trump rally at where we're at

1058
00:47:45,919 --> 00:47:52,063
So Mitch McConnell was screwing it up the whole time he was the the the the trailer behind the scenes

1059
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:53,087
Alright

1060
00:47:53,343 --> 00:47:55,391
If you try and pull that

1061
00:47:55,647 --> 00:47:57,695
Now after this law

1062
00:47:57,951 --> 00:47:59,231
After this long

1063
00:47:59,487 --> 00:48:04,095
Then either you have to shut up forever because everything that you've told me if Mitch

1064
00:48:04,351 --> 00:48:06,655
McConnell's the secret bad guy the whole time

1065
00:48:06,911 --> 00:48:08,703
He was there

1066
00:48:13,311 --> 00:48:14,335
Yeah you know

1067
00:48:14,591 --> 00:48:15,871
Yeah and it's um

1068
00:48:16,383 --> 00:48:17,151
I don't know it

1069
00:48:17,407 --> 00:48:20,735
Trying too hard to make an interesting plot twist

1070
00:48:21,247 --> 00:48:26,623
And I am not going to go along for this this ride anybody who does

1071
00:48:26,879 --> 00:48:27,903
But you see this like

1072
00:48:28,159 --> 00:48:29,183
There are just like

1073
00:48:29,439 --> 00:48:30,463
Shoring up of rank

1074
00:48:30,975 --> 00:48:32,767
I was like the people who are

1075
00:48:33,023 --> 00:48:35,327
Blindly willing to just

1076
00:48:35,583 --> 00:48:39,679
Greeley throw away any kind of semblance of dignity that they have for Trump

1077
00:48:39,935 --> 00:48:40,447
They're good

1078
00:48:40,703 --> 00:48:41,471
Everybody else

1079
00:48:41,727 --> 00:48:42,239
Do they work

1080
00:48:42,495 --> 00:48:44,799
Owens and I have bad news for you

1081
00:48:45,055 --> 00:48:48,383
Was that Pence Paul ticket might not be happening after all

1082
00:48:48,895 --> 00:48:49,407
Is Reese's too.

1083
00:48:49,919 --> 00:48:51,199
Depends is truly loyal to Trump

1084
00:48:51,711 --> 00:48:55,039
During Access Hollywood Pence was trying to navigate Trump

1085
00:48:55,551 --> 00:48:56,319
So that he could be top of the

1086
00:48:56,575 --> 00:48:57,599
Ticket in 2016

1087
00:48:58,367 --> 00:48:58,879
Was Pence

1088
00:49:02,207 --> 00:49:03,999
Going to go she ate with Ecuador to get

1089
00:49:04,255 --> 00:49:06,303
Julian Assange arrested and extradited

1090
00:49:08,607 --> 00:49:11,167
Ballet in a lot of the never trumper's and problem people have

1091
00:49:11,423 --> 00:49:11,935
Come from pencil

1092
00:49:12,703 --> 00:49:13,983
Group of people

1093
00:49:14,239 --> 00:49:17,055
The White House

1094
00:49:17,311 --> 00:49:17,823
Good

1095
00:49:19,615 --> 00:49:24,991
Enemies arrested governor of Georgia Meto the defense bill

1096
00:49:25,247 --> 00:49:27,551
Turn little place down around your ears

1097
00:49:31,391 --> 00:49:32,415
Just a little much

1098
00:49:32,927 --> 00:49:33,439
It's a little much

1099
00:49:33,951 --> 00:49:34,975
It's a little cartoon

1100
00:49:38,303 --> 00:49:39,839
Like defining good and bad people now

1101
00:49:40,095 --> 00:49:40,863
I think it's it's

1102
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:42,655
It's really just sad though

1103
00:49:42,911 --> 00:49:43,423
Because

1104
00:49:44,703 --> 00:49:45,727
It's it's like

1105
00:49:46,239 --> 00:49:47,775
You obviously weren't actually

1106
00:49:49,055 --> 00:49:55,199
There's no possible way that you could be fooled by that s*** you knew had to have known that they were lying the whole time

1107
00:49:55,455 --> 00:49:56,479
They didn't really like Trump

1108
00:49:56,735 --> 00:49:57,759
Quickest route to f****** lunatic

1109
00:49:58,015 --> 00:49:59,295
And their old career politician

1110
00:50:00,575 --> 00:50:01,087
Right

1111
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:04,415
Alphabet don't know that

1112
00:50:04,671 --> 00:50:05,695
Then

1113
00:50:06,207 --> 00:50:07,487
That's just so sad

1114
00:50:07,743 --> 00:50:08,511
Especially because

1115
00:50:09,279 --> 00:50:11,839
I've been telling you that for my entire

1116
00:50:12,351 --> 00:50:12,863
Immediately

1117
00:50:13,375 --> 00:50:15,167
It's really interesting for me in particular.

1118
00:50:15,423 --> 00:50:15,935
To see you like

1119
00:50:16,191 --> 00:50:16,703
The

1120
00:50:16,959 --> 00:50:17,983
Turning on

1121
00:50:18,239 --> 00:50:20,799
On people so bluntly and so stupidly

1122
00:50:21,055 --> 00:50:22,847
Laytonville bar was

1123
00:50:23,103 --> 00:50:29,247
He went back and forth a number of times Barnes coming in here saying that everyone's Anatomy

1124
00:50:29,503 --> 00:50:33,343
For a while and now he's permanently out

1125
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:34,879
Sing the dog out he's out

1126
00:50:35,135 --> 00:50:37,183
So on the 17th

1127
00:50:37,439 --> 00:50:41,023
We learned that that two barns show is gone

1128
00:50:41,791 --> 00:50:43,071
But just barnstone

1129
00:50:43,583 --> 00:50:44,095
16

1130
00:50:44,607 --> 00:50:49,215
How's the election countdown

1131
00:50:50,495 --> 00:50:53,055
7 to 9 p.m. most nights with you on Lorain

1132
00:50:54,335 --> 00:50:58,943
16-piece promoting the show is Barnes his back he's been too busy but now he's back very fine

1133
00:50:59,199 --> 00:50:59,967
Gone

1134
00:51:00,223 --> 00:51:00,735
That's very funny

1135
00:51:00,991 --> 00:51:02,783
I think I think you're right I do

1136
00:51:03,039 --> 00:51:06,111
You kind of feel for David Knight a little bit he's losing his job right before

1137
00:51:06,367 --> 00:51:07,903
For Christmas

1138
00:51:08,927 --> 00:51:10,719
I enjoy seeing bat

1139
00:51:10,975 --> 00:51:11,487
Things happened to Rob

1140
00:51:11,743 --> 00:51:12,255
Barnes

1141
00:51:12,511 --> 00:51:15,327
In a different way and I know that if he doesn't have his f******

1142
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:21,983
Moonlighting gig at Infowars he's going to be fine scamming other people with fake constitutional lawsuit I think he has

1143
00:51:22,239 --> 00:51:23,263
Watching him

1144
00:51:23,775 --> 00:51:26,847
I think he has like a newsletter on Dave Rubin

1145
00:51:27,359 --> 00:51:29,919
Kickstarter or Kalyan clone

1146
00:51:30,175 --> 00:51:31,711
15in all right

1147
00:51:32,223 --> 00:51:33,247
So Alex

1148
00:51:33,503 --> 00:51:37,343
Start says farewell to Barnes I will see you on the evening show that won't exist

1149
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:40,159
Hilarious and now I must get to another gas

1150
00:51:40,671 --> 00:51:42,719
Suggest that I got the privilege

1151
00:51:42,975 --> 00:51:43,487
Hanging out with

1152
00:51:43,743 --> 00:51:46,047
DC when I was there yelling

1153
00:51:46,303 --> 00:51:47,071
And all this s***

1154
00:51:47,327 --> 00:51:47,839
Oh no

1155
00:51:48,095 --> 00:51:48,863
Someone who had the best

1156
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:49,631
Speech

1157
00:51:50,143 --> 00:51:50,655
Oh no

1158
00:51:51,423 --> 00:51:54,751
Powerful messages

1159
00:51:55,519 --> 00:51:57,055
Million Maga March

1160
00:51:57,311 --> 00:51:57,823
This was about

1161
00:51:59,615 --> 00:52:00,383
A gigantic one

1162
00:52:00,895 --> 00:52:01,663
It was a month ago

1163
00:52:02,943 --> 00:52:03,967
100000

1164
00:52:04,223 --> 00:52:04,735
People total

1165
00:52:07,039 --> 00:52:11,135
Last time I had the most powerful message that we're not going to back down to the club list the New World Order

1166
00:52:14,463 --> 00:52:15,487
Message

1167
00:52:15,743 --> 00:52:16,511
These events

1168
00:52:20,351 --> 00:52:25,983
Yeah they're not going to be for sure because I watch

1169
00:52:26,495 --> 00:52:27,263
Hours

1170
00:52:27,775 --> 00:52:30,591
Of these rallies not speak at

1171
00:52:30,847 --> 00:52:33,151
Either of the two rallies but I watch

1172
00:52:34,175 --> 00:52:40,319
He was clearly speaking in some fashion

1173
00:52:40,575 --> 00:52:42,367
Bullhorn on the street

1174
00:52:42,879 --> 00:52:44,927
Something

1175
00:52:45,183 --> 00:52:49,535
Might have been like a third event that I would just don't even know about that

1176
00:52:49,791 --> 00:52:53,631
I only have so much time in my life I can only watch so many of these routes

1177
00:52:54,143 --> 00:52:54,911
Soon

1178
00:52:55,423 --> 00:52:55,935
Do you know

1179
00:52:56,191 --> 00:52:56,703
McConnell

1180
00:52:57,215 --> 00:52:57,727
Barrett

1181
00:52:58,495 --> 00:52:59,263
Kavanaugh

1182
00:52:59,519 --> 00:53:00,287
Nikki said

1183
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:03,359
The GOP is the enemy

1184
00:53:04,127 --> 00:53:05,151
I said Sunday

1185
00:53:06,687 --> 00:53:08,223
2 RC Saturday speeches

1186
00:53:11,039 --> 00:53:13,599
Republican party establishment are the enemies

1187
00:53:14,879 --> 00:53:15,391
But

1188
00:53:15,647 --> 00:53:17,439
We have to make sure that doesn't get damaged

1189
00:53:18,975 --> 00:53:19,487
Target

1190
00:53:19,743 --> 00:53:20,767
Neocon

1191
00:53:22,303 --> 00:53:23,839
Populist America first

1192
00:53:24,095 --> 00:53:25,375
McConnell

1193
00:53:30,751 --> 00:53:31,519
He's definitely

1194
00:53:31,775 --> 00:53:32,799
Working for the other side

1195
00:53:34,591 --> 00:53:38,687
That's not what McConnell saying he's he's saying that you're insisting on

1196
00:53:38,943 --> 00:53:42,015
Denying reality is probably going to hurt our electoral chances

1197
00:53:42,271 --> 00:53:47,135
Hey you guys you know how you're screaming that all elections are frauds and that you should

1198
00:53:47,391 --> 00:53:47,903
Vote

1199
00:53:48,159 --> 00:53:49,951
That's going to hurt us in the election

1200
00:53:50,975 --> 00:53:52,767
Where we need you to vote

1201
00:53:54,047 --> 00:53:55,327
Know your Chinese Asia

1202
00:53:55,583 --> 00:54:00,959
Damn it maybe I've gone too far I miss McConnell so I will learn the error of my ways

1203
00:54:01,471 --> 00:54:01,983
Nope

1204
00:54:02,751 --> 00:54:03,775
He will end up having

1205
00:54:04,031 --> 00:54:09,919
The people that you have inspired and enabled in facilitated now screaming at rallies about how

1206
00:54:10,175 --> 00:54:10,943
We need to destroy you

1207
00:54:11,199 --> 00:54:11,711
Excellent

1208
00:54:11,967 --> 00:54:13,247
One of the eclipse

1209
00:54:13,759 --> 00:54:15,807
Laying out the future

1210
00:54:16,063 --> 00:54:17,343
And the future battle plan

1211
00:54:17,855 --> 00:54:19,135
At least

1212
00:54:58,559 --> 00:55:02,399
Game of chance

1213
00:55:02,655 --> 00:55:08,799
Alex's think I think he sees that video and he remembers like being in dcne remembers like

1214
00:55:09,567 --> 00:55:10,591
Go to mad at those

1215
00:55:10,847 --> 00:55:11,615
Women for America

1216
00:55:11,871 --> 00:55:12,639
The first people

1217
00:55:12,895 --> 00:55:18,015
I don't like how they organize these rallies and then don't let me speak with them cuz I'm entitled to

1218
00:55:19,039 --> 00:55:20,575
This is a parallelogram allegory

1219
00:55:22,111 --> 00:55:23,903
Submariner battleship

1220
00:55:24,415 --> 00:55:24,927
A truck

1221
00:55:25,695 --> 00:55:31,071
Give five towards women that are neocon

1222
00:55:35,167 --> 00:55:35,935
It is just

1223
00:55:36,959 --> 00:55:37,471
Falling asleep

1224
00:55:40,543 --> 00:55:43,359
A lot of the hundred thousand people 20,000 here you run over

1225
00:55:43,615 --> 00:55:46,175
They're all cheering and then

1226
00:55:46,431 --> 00:55:46,943
Muse

1227
00:55:47,199 --> 00:55:49,503
And then the poor Republicans of a Mainline

1228
00:55:50,015 --> 00:55:52,063
I know a little trumpet Scott deal

1229
00:55:52,319 --> 00:55:54,111
They get 20,000

1230
00:55:54,367 --> 00:55:55,903
Popular it's not constitutional

1231
00:55:57,951 --> 00:55:59,743
Everyone's always running away from

1232
00:55:59,999 --> 00:56:00,767
What Victoria

1233
00:56:02,047 --> 00:56:06,143
I don't think is wrong stuff

1234
00:56:06,399 --> 00:56:07,167
Speakers Worth news

1235
00:56:07,423 --> 00:56:11,007
Bright star quality

1236
00:56:13,567 --> 00:56:15,103
Scooter the misunderstanding

1237
00:56:15,359 --> 00:56:16,895
Like spectacle for Subs

1238
00:56:17,151 --> 00:56:17,663
Yeah yeah

1239
00:56:17,919 --> 00:56:18,431
Like I don't

1240
00:56:18,687 --> 00:56:20,223
Think there's anything

1241
00:56:20,479 --> 00:56:22,271
And being able to draw a crowd of

1242
00:56:22,527 --> 00:56:23,807
10000 let's say

1243
00:56:24,063 --> 00:56:24,575
Isn't it

1244
00:56:24,831 --> 00:56:29,951
An indication that he knows the Constitution I don't think there's a difference for him between 70

1245
00:56:30,719 --> 00:56:35,583
You know it's not that he understands our misunderstanding or it's just that it doesn't exist

1246
00:56:36,095 --> 00:56:38,399
Yeah you know like five million views means

1247
00:56:39,167 --> 00:56:44,799
500 million people love that's right that's how it barks yeah that's the only makes sense also I'd like to clarify one thing

1248
00:56:45,311 --> 00:56:50,175
These people starting these rallies and organizing them and getting the permits does mean that they

1249
00:56:50,431 --> 00:56:55,551
You can choose who speaks at it and who doesn't well I feel like I'm missing the part where he was going to say like

1250
00:56:55,807 --> 00:56:57,599
So next time we are going to get the

1251
00:56:57,855 --> 00:56:58,623
The permit

1252
00:56:58,879 --> 00:56:59,647
He's not going to say that

1253
00:57:00,159 --> 00:57:01,951
We'll see cuz it feels like that

1254
00:57:02,207 --> 00:57:03,231
What's the real complaint here

1255
00:57:03,743 --> 00:57:07,327
Imo's just whining that he's not the winner he's too busy

1256
00:57:07,583 --> 00:57:08,607
Call the work

1257
00:57:09,119 --> 00:57:10,399
Not psychic trances

1258
00:57:10,655 --> 00:57:12,191
Take a while

1259
00:57:12,447 --> 00:57:15,263
I know somebody who just lost his job and is free

1260
00:57:15,775 --> 00:57:17,823
I don't think he's going to fill those shoes

1261
00:57:18,335 --> 00:57:22,943
Nick Fuentes has an interesting idea for the way forward

1262
00:57:23,199 --> 00:57:25,247
For these weirdo conservative

1263
00:57:26,271 --> 00:57:31,391
Democrats that were saying destroy the GOP this is a message I could get behind

1264
00:57:32,927 --> 00:57:33,695
First half of the message

1265
00:57:34,463 --> 00:57:35,487
Destroy the GOP

1266
00:57:35,743 --> 00:57:38,047
As it exists destroy the GOP establishment

1267
00:57:39,071 --> 00:57:39,583
Did you know

1268
00:57:44,191 --> 00:57:44,959
We have to destroy the

1269
00:57:45,471 --> 00:57:47,775
GOP establishment headed by Mitch McConnell

1270
00:57:48,287 --> 00:57:49,311
What's America last

1271
00:57:49,567 --> 00:57:50,847
We have two primary all those p

1272
00:57:51,103 --> 00:57:51,871
People replace them

1273
00:57:52,383 --> 00:57:53,663
And house in the Senate

1274
00:57:54,175 --> 00:57:55,199
And the state government

1275
00:57:55,455 --> 00:57:59,807
And we have to replace them with people that truly believe in America First truly believe in

1276
00:58:00,575 --> 00:58:02,623
President

1277
00:58:02,879 --> 00:58:04,671
When he ran in 2016

1278
00:58:05,183 --> 00:58:07,487
Look Nick Fuentes like 14 years old

1279
00:58:07,743 --> 00:58:11,327
So I'm going to forgive him for not remembering that they did this already

1280
00:58:11,839 --> 00:58:12,607
Is called

1281
00:58:13,631 --> 00:58:17,471
This is the crazier version that you guys wanted last

1282
00:58:17,983 --> 00:58:22,847
Yeah you already have another cycle of this like

1283
00:58:23,103 --> 00:58:23,615
Whatever

1284
00:58:23,871 --> 00:58:24,383
Who cares

1285
00:58:24,639 --> 00:58:25,663
I want to forgive that

1286
00:58:25,919 --> 00:58:27,455
What I'm not going to forgive is

1287
00:58:27,711 --> 00:58:29,503
The fact that he doesn't remember they did that

1288
00:58:29,759 --> 00:58:32,831
This year over with running

1289
00:58:33,087 --> 00:58:37,951
Tell these other people Enrique tarrio was your run everybody lost a f****** primaries

1290
00:58:38,207 --> 00:58:40,511
Because the people that you end up attracting

1291
00:58:40,767 --> 00:58:46,911
Are not now.

1292
00:58:47,167 --> 00:58:47,935
Bull in the primary

1293
00:58:48,447 --> 00:58:53,823
Thought they were voting for a GOP candidate cuz they've been in there for a while but they were actually voting for a traitor

1294
00:58:54,079 --> 00:58:54,591
Bright

1295
00:58:55,103 --> 00:58:55,615
Okay

1296
00:58:56,127 --> 00:58:58,943
Got to go I think we should all be

1297
00:58:59,199 --> 00:59:02,527
I apologize I believe Loomer did win her primary

1298
00:59:04,319 --> 00:59:06,111
Send the general

1299
00:59:06,367 --> 00:59:06,879
Folks

1300
00:59:07,135 --> 00:59:07,903
Boston

1301
00:59:08,159 --> 00:59:08,927
Primaries

1302
00:59:09,183 --> 00:59:11,999
No I

1303
00:59:14,047 --> 00:59:14,559
Adele

1304
00:59:14,815 --> 00:59:17,375
I think we should all be screaming it established

1305
00:59:17,631 --> 00:59:18,143
Republicans

1306
00:59:18,399 --> 00:59:18,911
The only way

1307
00:59:19,167 --> 00:59:20,959
The GOP it survives as if they all band

1308
00:59:21,215 --> 00:59:23,007
Together in crush the extreme right-wing

1309
00:59:23,263 --> 00:59:26,079
And I think we tell the extreme right-wing that the only way the gop's

1310
00:59:26,335 --> 00:59:27,615
Survives if they band together

1311
00:59:27,871 --> 00:59:29,663
I'm crushing The Establishment Republican

1312
00:59:29,919 --> 00:59:30,943
I forget to send

1313
00:59:31,967 --> 00:59:34,015
At least half of that's going to happen on its own

1314
00:59:34,271 --> 00:59:38,111
Probably true that's why we got to make sure both happen because it would have happened

1315
00:59:38,367 --> 00:59:39,391
We're going to get to the Tea Party

1316
00:59:40,927 --> 00:59:44,511
I don't know if that's avoidable

1317
00:59:45,791 --> 00:59:46,559
Interesting Lee

1318
00:59:48,095 --> 00:59:49,375
Nikola Tesla under Alex

1319
00:59:49,631 --> 00:59:53,727
Except slightly different strategies about what they should do in Florida Georgia

1320
00:59:54,495 --> 00:59:55,519
Time of the belief that

1321
00:59:56,287 --> 00:59:57,311
The first blow the Wii

1322
00:59:57,567 --> 00:59:59,103
Republican Party

1323
00:59:59,871 --> 01:00:01,407
Withholding are votes in Georgia

1324
01:00:01,663 --> 01:00:04,479
What's holding our votes in the Senate runoff and preventing them from

1325
01:00:04,735 --> 01:00:10,879
Reclaiming control this out

1326
01:00:12,671 --> 01:00:15,999
Alex is not into that that is I don't know about that

1327
01:00:16,255 --> 01:00:18,559
His position is

1328
01:00:18,815 --> 01:00:19,583
Q primary

1329
01:00:19,839 --> 01:00:22,655
Some Republican you know with a crazy person

1330
01:00:22,911 --> 01:00:24,703
I'm all for that

1331
01:00:24,959 --> 01:00:26,751
Torpedoing the election

1332
01:00:27,263 --> 01:00:28,543
Lesbian letting a Democrat

1333
01:00:29,055 --> 01:00:29,567
I don't know

1334
01:00:29,823 --> 01:00:35,455
We need to punish the Republican party with holder votes

1335
01:00:36,223 --> 01:00:37,503
He's very much like

1336
01:00:37,759 --> 01:00:39,551
Accelerationist

1337
01:00:41,343 --> 01:00:42,623
Taking Alex's more like

1338
01:00:42,879 --> 01:00:43,391
I don't know

1339
01:00:43,903 --> 01:00:44,415
These people just

1340
01:00:45,439 --> 01:00:46,463
Straight up

1341
01:00:46,719 --> 01:00:47,231
How

1342
01:00:47,743 --> 01:00:48,511
How f******

1343
01:00:49,023 --> 01:00:50,047
Cruel are you to me

1344
01:00:50,559 --> 01:00:51,327
To be like

1345
01:00:51,839 --> 01:00:54,399
We're going to tell everybody with troubles

1346
01:00:54,655 --> 01:00:55,423
Pictures of God

1347
01:00:55,679 --> 01:00:57,215
Florida jail

1348
01:00:57,471 --> 01:01:01,567
And after losing election what we need to do is we need to focus on

1349
01:01:01,823 --> 01:01:02,591
Small election

1350
01:01:02,847 --> 01:01:04,639
And we need to primary the Republican

1351
01:01:05,151 --> 01:01:08,479
Que ya

1352
01:01:08,991 --> 01:01:10,783
The Lord also needs primary from time to time

1353
01:01:11,807 --> 01:01:15,135
Yeah with the with the seitan made

1354
01:01:15,391 --> 01:01:16,159
Forget was

1355
01:01:16,415 --> 01:01:16,927
County

1356
01:01:20,511 --> 01:01:23,327
Because an interesting angle on qanon

1357
01:01:24,351 --> 01:01:26,143
What I like about the qanon stuff

1358
01:01:26,399 --> 01:01:29,215
Papa's that it gets a lot of people to believe the right things

1359
01:01:30,495 --> 01:01:32,031
I believe the right things for the wrong reason

1360
01:01:32,543 --> 01:01:34,591
Against them to start thinking about Connections

1361
01:01:34,847 --> 01:01:36,895
Between Global special interest

1362
01:01:37,407 --> 01:01:38,175
Write questions about

1363
01:01:38,687 --> 01:01:39,455
Files and seitan

1364
01:01:39,711 --> 01:01:40,735
Delete some things like that

1365
01:01:41,247 --> 01:01:42,527
Largely for the wrong reasons

1366
01:01:45,087 --> 01:01:46,367
I do appreciate

1367
01:01:46,623 --> 01:01:47,647
The hubris

1368
01:01:47,903 --> 01:01:49,183
Of all of these idiot

1369
01:01:49,695 --> 01:01:50,207
Who are alike

1370
01:01:50,975 --> 01:01:51,999
You know what we need

1371
01:01:52,255 --> 01:01:53,023
To do is get the

1372
01:01:53,279 --> 01:01:54,559
The swirling masses

1373
01:01:54,815 --> 01:01:55,839
To believe something

1374
01:01:56,095 --> 01:01:57,119
Similar to what I believe

1375
01:01:57,631 --> 01:01:58,399
And then I'll be able to come

1376
01:01:58,655 --> 01:01:59,167
Control

1377
01:02:00,703 --> 01:02:02,495
It doesn't quite work that way anyways

1378
01:02:02,751 --> 01:02:03,775
No sorry

1379
01:02:04,031 --> 01:02:04,543
Box

1380
01:02:04,799 --> 01:02:05,823
I will say again

1381
01:02:06,591 --> 01:02:07,103
I'm going

1382
01:02:07,359 --> 01:02:07,871
To give

1383
01:02:08,127 --> 01:02:09,151
Make a pass on this

1384
01:02:09,407 --> 01:02:10,175
Cuz he has a wee baby

1385
01:02:10,431 --> 01:02:14,271
But he seems to be patting himself on the back a little bit for

1386
01:02:14,527 --> 01:02:15,039
Discovering

1387
01:02:15,295 --> 01:02:16,575
The concept of local politics

1388
01:02:17,343 --> 01:02:18,623
Now Trump wants this house

1389
01:02:19,135 --> 01:02:19,647
Takeover of

1390
01:02:22,719 --> 01:02:25,791
And now we have to wage war for everything beneath the presidents

1391
01:02:26,559 --> 01:02:27,839
We have to wage war the primary

1392
01:02:28,351 --> 01:02:29,887
House Republican Senate Republicans

1393
01:02:30,143 --> 01:02:31,167
We have to run in

1394
01:02:31,679 --> 01:02:35,775
Racism local races we have to take over the RNC in the party apparatus

1395
01:02:36,543 --> 01:02:40,127
Better said that was perfectly said

1396
01:02:40,639 --> 01:02:41,407
It's so trite

1397
01:02:41,663 --> 01:02:42,175
I have

1398
01:02:42,431 --> 01:02:43,967
2018

1399
01:02:44,223 --> 01:02:44,735
I have

1400
01:02:44,991 --> 01:02:45,759
In 2016

1401
01:02:46,015 --> 01:02:46,527
I have

1402
01:02:46,783 --> 01:02:47,551
In 2014

1403
01:02:47,807 --> 01:02:52,159
I have 2012 Revolution Aries stuff

1404
01:02:52,415 --> 01:02:54,207
This is very Bland

1405
01:02:55,231 --> 01:02:57,791
Start of one of the things that I think is interesting and a little B

1406
01:02:58,047 --> 01:02:58,559
Scary about

1407
01:02:59,071 --> 01:02:59,583
Is that like

1408
01:02:59,839 --> 01:03:00,351
Like beanies

1409
01:03:00,607 --> 01:03:03,935
This there's also an obsession with the idea of fighting against

1410
01:03:04,191 --> 01:03:04,959
Amnesty

1411
01:03:06,239 --> 01:03:11,359
And and and identity and America is also like

1412
01:03:11,871 --> 01:03:14,431
Okay yeah you're talkin about running for

1413
01:03:16,735 --> 01:03:17,503
A local election

1414
01:03:17,759 --> 01:03:21,087
Running for like the school president

1415
01:03:21,343 --> 01:03:22,111
Or whatever

1416
01:03:22,623 --> 01:03:26,975
Like that that b the banality than the boring

1417
01:03:27,231 --> 01:03:29,535
With the evilness hidden behind it it's kind of

1418
01:03:29,791 --> 01:03:32,863
Scary Biden is stealing the election in

1419
01:03:33,375 --> 01:03:34,399
Caroline all events at the

1420
01:03:34,655 --> 01:03:35,679
F****** globalist

1421
01:03:36,447 --> 01:03:40,799
And that is why I'm going to vote no on the expansion of that road

1422
01:03:41,055 --> 01:03:41,823
Route 6

1423
01:03:44,383 --> 01:03:45,663
Mechanics out of there

1424
01:03:45,919 --> 01:03:46,687
In-N-Out

1425
01:03:47,199 --> 01:03:48,479
In-N-Out got destroyed the GOP

1426
01:03:49,247 --> 01:03:51,295
Now we're going to play a new game

1427
01:03:51,551 --> 01:03:52,063
On the show

1428
01:03:52,575 --> 01:03:54,111
I'm going to play

1429
01:03:54,367 --> 01:03:55,135
An angry clip

1430
01:03:55,647 --> 01:03:56,927
Got from Alex Jones

1431
01:03:57,183 --> 01:03:58,719
See what are you without

1432
01:03:58,975 --> 01:04:05,119
Who is targeted at you have to guess who is he yelling about

1433
01:04:05,375 --> 01:04:05,887
This is called

1434
01:04:06,143 --> 01:04:08,447
Guess who Alex's telling to burn in hell

1435
01:04:09,983 --> 01:04:11,775
Inhale you little Satanist

1436
01:04:12,543 --> 01:04:14,079
Great you are now

1437
01:04:14,335 --> 01:04:15,615
Amazing you are

1438
01:04:17,663 --> 01:04:19,455
Global collapse

1439
01:04:21,247 --> 01:04:22,783
Who is Alex

1440
01:04:23,039 --> 01:04:23,807
No

1441
01:04:24,575 --> 01:04:27,391
It's little I thought the little weekend asking me

1442
01:04:27,903 --> 01:04:29,695
I can ask you two questions

1443
01:04:29,951 --> 01:04:30,975
All right Richard

1444
01:04:31,487 --> 01:04:34,047
Very very very rich

1445
01:04:34,559 --> 01:04:35,327
I don't know if I want to say

1446
01:04:35,583 --> 01:04:36,351
Obscene labor

1447
01:04:37,631 --> 01:04:41,727
All right I wish you five questions I wish I had some more specific

1448
01:04:42,239 --> 01:04:45,311
Is very rich is a is a more subjective question that I think I would

1449
01:04:45,567 --> 01:04:46,335
Superheroes

1450
01:04:46,591 --> 01:04:47,359
Billionaire higher

1456
01:05:09,119 --> 01:05:10,143
Oh I meant Alice

1457
01:05:10,655 --> 01:05:14,239

Open it's definitely not stelter I'm not sure I've heard Alex bring this person up before

1459
01:05:22,175 --> 01:05:28,319
Little Liza Jane

1460
01:05:31,391 --> 01:05:34,207
You have all the pieces you need

1461
01:05:35,487 --> 01:05:37,535
Jesus's wife

1462

No

1463

01:06:05,439 --> 01:06:07,743
Trouble in Paradise as it were

1468

Bourdon actually listening to this episode now because like listen to this this is 30 seconds

1469
01:06:14,143 --> 01:06:15,423

01:06:16,703 --> 01:06:17,983
Dance to it this is

1472
01:06:18,239 --> 01:06:19,007

Pompeo test negative

1474
01:06:22,591 --> 01:06:23,359

01:06:30,015 --> 01:06:32,063
Excuse for Tom Cruise in

Kansas

01:06:43,583 --> 01:06:45,375
Mayor resigns were violent threats from

1481
01:06:51,519 --> 01:06:52,543
That's it like this

1482
01:06:52,799 --> 01:06:56,383
Substance of his news breakdown like it's kind of like

1483
01:06:56,895 --> 01:07:00,479
Like a like a dishy insult after reading

1484
01:07:02,271 --> 01:07:03,551
This is Bill

1485
01:07:03,807 --> 01:07:05,087
Cruz didn't need

1486
01:07:05,343 --> 01:07:05,855
The Bachelorette

1487
01:07:06,111 --> 01:07:08,415
He gets to act like he owns everything and run

1488
01:07:08,671 --> 01:07:09,183
The place because he's

1489
01:07:09,439 --> 01:07:10,463
The figurehead of a religion

1490
01:07:10,719 --> 01:07:16,863
Find it strange that Alex isn't taking issue with a Scientology aspect no problem no.

1491
01:07:17,119 --> 01:07:17,887
Now that makes perfect sense

1492
01:07:18,655 --> 01:07:19,423
So Alex has

1493
01:07:19,679 --> 01:07:21,215
Just been dealing with

1494
01:07:21,471 --> 01:07:21,983
Hayden

1495
01:07:22,495 --> 01:07:23,263
General Hayden

1496
01:07:23,519 --> 01:07:26,847
On Twitter that he agreed with someone else who tweeted that Alex

1497
01:07:27,359 --> 01:07:29,151
Should be arrested and Alex

1498
01:07:29,663 --> 01:07:30,175
Pumps

1499
01:07:30,431 --> 01:07:36,319
Of course he is

1500
01:07:37,087 --> 01:07:38,623
CNN

1501
01:07:39,647 --> 01:07:40,159
Complication

1502
01:07:40,927 --> 01:07:43,231
Alex Jones maybe arrested

1503
01:07:48,607 --> 01:07:50,143
Did Jones threatened to kill by

1504
01:07:51,423 --> 01:07:52,191
Sunday

1505
01:07:52,703 --> 01:07:54,751
Call for Jones be arrested for threatening to kill

1506
01:07:56,287 --> 01:07:57,055
Monday

1507
01:08:03,199 --> 01:08:05,247
Alex is so excited about this

1508
01:08:08,063 --> 01:08:13,951
Michael Hayden is paying attention to him in a way that he probably would never I got

1509
01:08:14,207 --> 01:08:16,255
Month Saturday

1510
01:08:16,511 --> 01:08:17,279
Imply the

1511
01:08:17,535 --> 01:08:19,071
Maybe Michael Aiden's a pedophile

1512
01:08:21,887 --> 01:08:23,679
Mysterious

1513
01:08:23,935 --> 01:08:25,215
Orphanages

1514
01:08:25,727 --> 01:08:27,007
And springs for children

1515
01:08:32,895 --> 01:08:34,431
Looks like a

1516
01:08:34,943 --> 01:08:36,735
He's a child molester

1517
01:08:37,503 --> 01:08:39,039
Dog shelter looks

1518
01:08:41,087 --> 01:08:42,879
Hayden's on Twitter photo

1519
01:08:43,135 --> 01:08:44,671
Is the creepiest photo on please pull up

1520
01:08:45,183 --> 01:08:46,975
Michael D Higgins Shelbyville

1521
01:08:50,559 --> 01:08:51,839
It's not that creepy

1522
01:08:52,607 --> 01:08:54,143
Sometimes I'm just not sure if things are

1523
01:08:54,399 --> 01:08:59,775
Real now it's very weird

1524
01:09:00,031 --> 01:09:02,079
What is this real Am I Dreaming what

1525
01:09:02,335 --> 01:09:04,127
What are we what's going on pretty strain

1526
01:09:04,383 --> 01:09:07,455
This guy has tweeted something I dislike

1527
01:09:07,711 --> 01:09:08,479
I am going to occur

1528
01:09:08,735 --> 01:09:13,343
Accuse him of stealing children because he looks creepy to me

1529
01:09:13,599 --> 01:09:15,903
Yeah but Alex

1530
01:09:16,671 --> 01:09:17,951
Okay gotcha

1531
01:09:18,207 --> 01:09:19,231
I don't know

1532
01:09:19,743 --> 01:09:20,255
Harrison

1533
01:09:20,511 --> 01:09:22,303
Smith probably someone who works at Infowars

1534
01:09:24,095 --> 01:09:27,167
Hayden's Twitter timeline and found some things

1535
01:09:27,679 --> 01:09:28,703
To get upset about

1536
01:09:28,959 --> 01:09:29,471
Great reset

1537
01:09:30,495 --> 01:09:33,055
He put out a bunch of plates and pro-life about Trump

1538
01:09:36,127 --> 01:09:37,407
Decision

1539
01:09:37,663 --> 01:09:41,503
So what diseases that he tweeted a picture of like Graves

1540
01:09:43,807 --> 01:09:45,343
It was from another account

1541
01:09:45,855 --> 01:09:47,647
He retweeted a with a quote tweet

1542
01:09:47,903 --> 01:09:49,695
Pro-life?

1543
01:09:49,951 --> 01:09:51,743
Bright

1544
01:09:53,535 --> 01:09:54,047
MMA

1545
01:09:54,303 --> 01:09:54,815
Put out

1546
01:09:55,327 --> 01:09:56,095
Did the Joker town

1547
01:09:56,607 --> 01:09:57,887
An image of a mass grave

1548
01:09:59,423 --> 01:09:59,935
Killing everybody

1549
01:10:00,447 --> 01:10:03,007
Because churches could be open

1550
01:10:04,543 --> 01:10:05,055
Close up

1551
01:10:06,079 --> 01:10:08,895
Literally days later

1552
01:10:10,175 --> 01:10:11,711
Disguise

1553
01:10:12,223 --> 01:10:13,247
He puts out a pitch

1554
01:10:13,759 --> 01:10:16,063
Steelers

1555
01:10:16,575 --> 01:10:18,111
27

1556
01:10:19,647 --> 01:10:21,183
Let's do some football

1557
01:10:21,695 --> 01:10:23,487
Happy birthday

1558
01:10:23,743 --> 01:10:25,535
No social distancing NFL game

1559
01:10:28,351 --> 01:10:33,727
Imagine the irony of this piece

1560
01:10:34,495 --> 01:10:36,287
Trump is murdering people because of

1561
01:10:38,591 --> 01:10:41,151
Moscow Mule done with 10 people thousand whatever

1562
01:10:41,407 --> 01:10:42,431
Walmart to be open

1563
01:10:42,687 --> 01:10:43,711
Can be open

1564
01:10:43,967 --> 01:10:45,247
Disneyland can be open

1565
01:10:45,503 --> 01:10:46,015
But

1566
01:10:46,271 --> 01:10:47,295
Your churches can

1567
01:10:48,319 --> 01:10:49,599
Liquor stores are open

1568
01:10:50,111 --> 01:10:51,647
All this is going on but he's a big

1569
01:10:51,903 --> 01:10:52,671
Pittsburgh Steelers

1570
01:10:55,231 --> 01:10:56,255
Aiden

1571
01:10:56,511 --> 01:10:57,279
Open source

1572
01:10:57,791 --> 01:10:58,815
Open source baby

1573
01:11:00,863 --> 01:11:04,191
GIF that he tweeted was from last season

1574
01:11:04,447 --> 01:11:06,239
The football

1575
01:11:06,495 --> 01:11:10,847
Back when there were huge crowds

1576
01:11:11,871 --> 01:11:13,407
Putting their towels in the air

1577
01:11:13,663 --> 01:11:14,431
Great

1578
01:11:14,687 --> 01:11:15,967
It it's not a gotcha

1579
01:11:16,223 --> 01:11:17,247
It's not that.

1580
01:11:19,039 --> 01:11:20,831
Now the only thing sadder than reading those two

1581
01:11:21,087 --> 01:11:21,599
Tweet this girl

1582
01:11:21,855 --> 01:11:22,623
Going through his timeline

1583
01:11:23,135 --> 01:11:23,647
Find those

1584
01:11:23,903 --> 01:11:25,695
Yeah and then I was thinking this is like

1585
01:11:25,951 --> 01:11:27,487
Can own

1586
01:11:27,743 --> 01:11:31,327
I got you open source

1587
01:11:33,887 --> 01:11:37,471
I mean when you read when you read too much about tweets

1588
01:11:37,983 --> 01:11:38,495
You know

1589
01:11:39,263 --> 01:11:40,031
You can read everybody

1590
01:11:40,287 --> 01:11:41,311
Breeding 1322

1591
01:11:42,079 --> 01:11:43,103
But would you read about

1592
01:11:43,359 --> 01:11:48,735
Now we're in real file articles are about

1593
01:11:48,991 --> 01:11:50,015
No f******

1594
01:11:50,271 --> 01:11:50,783
Crazy ass

1595
01:11:51,039 --> 01:11:52,063
It seems trivial

1596
01:11:53,087 --> 01:11:55,903
So I was getting a little bit like I don't know I feel untethered

1597
01:11:56,159 --> 01:11:57,439
I don't know what's going on here

1598
01:11:57,695 --> 01:11:58,975
You know I feel like

1599
01:11:59,743 --> 01:12:00,255
Really important

1600
01:12:00,511 --> 01:12:02,303
Alex is downsizing

1601
01:12:02,559 --> 01:12:03,327
Well I got.

1602
01:12:03,583 --> 01:12:05,887
Effective immediately dad Bono

1603
01:12:08,447 --> 01:12:12,031
Why doesn't feel like at all like anything is going on here on the 16th

1604
01:12:12,287 --> 01:12:13,055
It seems very much.

1605
01:12:13,311 --> 01:12:14,591
Just business as usual

1606
01:12:14,847 --> 01:12:16,383
Anaconda was boring

1607
01:12:16,895 --> 01:12:18,687
Yeah just Nick Fuentes has a great idea.

1608
01:12:18,943 --> 01:12:21,503
To destroy the GOP but also I don't want to do what

1609
01:12:21,759 --> 01:12:24,575
Nick wants a suggestion

1610
01:12:24,831 --> 01:12:28,671
Yeah yeah would have seats and I don't like that

1611
01:12:30,463 --> 01:12:31,231
Like I don't know

1612
01:12:31,999 --> 01:12:32,511
And then

1613
01:12:33,279 --> 01:12:33,791
Patrick

1614
01:12:34,303 --> 01:12:35,327
I can't remember his last name

1615
01:12:35,839 --> 01:12:36,863
It'll come to me later

1616
01:12:37,375 --> 01:12:39,935
No he's the guy who's the Overstock CEO

1617
01:12:40,191 --> 01:12:46,335
Who is dating that Russian spy little bit out there

1618
01:12:47,871 --> 01:12:48,639
He's back

1619
01:12:51,199 --> 01:12:52,735
He has an interesting story to tell

1620
01:12:52,991 --> 01:12:56,831
Here in the my pillow guy should have a tag team wrestling team like something

1621
01:12:59,135 --> 01:13:00,159
This guy Patrick

1622
01:13:00,671 --> 01:13:06,815
Overstock CEO introduced Michael Flynn at the rally of course

1623
01:13:07,071 --> 01:13:11,679
Why wouldn't I just agree with that guy bring that up on the show cuz his speech was kind of like I don't care

1624
01:13:11,935 --> 01:13:12,447
What

1625
01:13:12,703 --> 01:13:13,215
He is back

1626
01:13:13,727 --> 01:13:14,239
With Alex

1627
01:13:14,751 --> 01:13:15,519
Amman

1628
01:13:15,775 --> 01:13:17,567
He's got a big old story to tell

1629
01:13:18,847 --> 01:13:19,615
I believe her story

1630
01:13:20,127 --> 01:13:22,431
Alot of things on Hillary she was very area

1631
01:13:22,943 --> 01:13:24,735
To taking over what $2000000

1632
01:13:25,247 --> 01:13:27,551
Different government money

1633
01:13:27,807 --> 01:13:29,087
To give him access that's what

1634
01:13:29,599 --> 01:13:30,623
Email server shows

1635
01:13:31,135 --> 01:13:33,951
Now the southern district has been investigating

1636
01:13:34,463 --> 01:13:36,767
Will you came out and said this and I saw the video yesterday

1637
01:13:37,279 --> 01:13:40,607
I said that's the same stuff I got told that there were successful thing

1638
01:13:40,863 --> 01:13:43,423
On Hillary but they when they thought she was going to win

1639
01:13:43,679 --> 01:13:44,959
Scrubbed and then

1640
01:13:46,239 --> 01:13:47,775
Has all that info

1641
01:13:51,103 --> 01:13:51,615
The latest

1642
01:13:51,871 --> 01:13:56,223
Alex has played a clip of Patrick from another show

1643
01:13:56,479 --> 01:13:56,991
And

1644
01:13:57,247 --> 01:14:00,831
He's telling this story that he got approached by the FBI

1645
01:14:01,087 --> 01:14:04,415
Do facilitate a sting operation on Hillary Clinton

1646
01:14:04,671 --> 01:14:09,023
Alright man eventually they're like we're not going to do anything you know.

1647
01:14:09,535 --> 01:14:10,047
You're giving up

1648
01:14:10,303 --> 01:14:14,655
Taking a bribe from a phone

1649
01:14:14,911 --> 01:14:16,959
Say anything about it until

1650
01:14:18,495 --> 01:14:19,519
Credible

1651
01:14:20,031 --> 01:14:20,543
That sounds right

1652
01:14:31,039 --> 01:14:34,111
I want you want to know why

1653
01:14:45,631 --> 01:14:46,143
The process

1654
01:14:49,983 --> 01:14:53,311
Conversation

1655
01:14:56,127 --> 01:14:56,639
Comfortable

1656
01:15:05,087 --> 01:15:07,391
So I waited really nice

1657
01:15:11,487 --> 01:15:11,999
So he's got it

1658
01:15:12,255 --> 01:15:16,095
He's got to tell his story now cuz of the elections over he's free to

1659
01:15:16,351 --> 01:15:16,863
To tell at all

1660
01:15:17,375 --> 01:15:17,887
Throw tomatoes

1661
01:15:20,191 --> 01:15:21,983
Eaton 2015

1662
01:15:22,239 --> 01:15:24,799
December 15th

1663
01:15:25,055 --> 01:15:26,079
He was a pro

1664
01:15:26,591 --> 01:15:28,127
Approached by the FBI course

1665
01:15:29,151 --> 01:15:30,175
December

1666
01:15:30,943 --> 01:15:37,087
2015 we need you

1667
01:15:53,215 --> 01:15:58,079
The email group and we know that's the New Yorker

1668
01:16:12,671 --> 01:16:13,695
I don't know if

1669
01:16:13,951 --> 01:16:14,719
It's

1670
01:16:14,975 --> 01:16:15,743
It should be

1671
01:16:16,255 --> 01:16:17,535
Seeing as like normal

1672
01:16:17,791 --> 01:16:19,071
Investigation

1673
01:16:19,327 --> 01:16:23,167
Starts with wanting to incarcerate somebody that's probably not.

1674
01:16:23,423 --> 01:16:24,447
Tainted investigators

1675
01:16:24,703 --> 01:16:28,799
It's almost like one that wouldn't really hold up upon

1676
01:16:29,311 --> 01:16:35,455
And it seems like if any of this is true which I don't think any of it is Comey might have been coming from the position

1677
01:16:35,967 --> 01:16:41,599
There's no reason

1678
01:16:42,111 --> 01:16:48,255
You guys are telling me that you want to talk to the CEO of overstock.com to try and sting Hillary

1679
01:16:48,511 --> 01:16:51,071
Clinton guess who doesn't get to do that you guys

1680
01:16:51,327 --> 01:16:51,839
It's go away now

1681
01:16:52,095 --> 01:16:55,167
Can I show all of my cards

1682
01:16:56,191 --> 01:16:58,751
I don't believe any of this

1683
01:16:59,007 --> 01:17:05,151
I will say this I didn't leave this video is making this s*** right off the bat the only thing eidetic

1684
01:17:05,407 --> 01:17:09,247
About this guy's memories that he was able to able to remember the word

1685
01:17:10,015 --> 01:17:11,295
He didn't memorize that is

1686
01:17:11,551 --> 01:17:13,087
Bullshitz here's the deal

1687
01:17:13,343 --> 01:17:13,855
Turkey

1688
01:17:14,111 --> 01:17:15,391
Has already bribed

1689
01:17:15,647 --> 01:17:16,159
Hillary Clinton

1690
01:17:16,671 --> 01:17:17,951
420 million

1691
01:17:18,975 --> 01:17:19,487
So now we

1692
01:17:19,743 --> 01:17:20,511
You just need to get Patrick

1693
01:17:21,023 --> 01:17:22,559
To facilitate another bra

1694
01:17:27,167 --> 01:17:28,447
Predicate information

1695
01:17:30,239 --> 01:17:30,751
However

1696
01:17:37,919 --> 01:17:38,687
And

1697
01:17:39,199 --> 01:17:40,991
Information

1698
01:17:41,247 --> 01:17:43,807
And the group in New York is now you

1699
01:17:44,575 --> 01:17:45,343
Force

1700
01:17:47,135 --> 01:17:51,999
New York

1701
01:17:52,767 --> 01:17:54,559
And you're going to facilitate

1702
01:17:56,607 --> 01:18:02,751
Who was known to want to bribe he has an eidetic memory you should remember

1703
01:18:04,799 --> 01:18:05,823
And somewhere

1704
01:18:06,079 --> 01:18:08,127
And it's going to happen in the next 2 months

1705
01:18:10,175 --> 01:18:16,319
From weather's been derailed somewhere they will be rude

1706
01:18:27,327 --> 01:18:33,471
So he's got to find he's got to befriend this government from unnamed other government

1707
01:18:33,727 --> 01:18:39,871
Himself in such a way that he can be the go-between between and Hillary

1708
01:18:40,127 --> 01:18:41,407
Clinton

1709
01:18:42,687 --> 01:18:43,199
This

1710
01:18:44,991 --> 01:18:50,879
I'm just going to throw that out there a huge question sure this story I'm just going to go out and say

1711
01:18:51,391 --> 01:18:53,439
Why did they come to him

1712
01:18:54,463 --> 01:18:54,975
Because

1713
01:18:55,231 --> 01:18:58,815
Experience cozying up to governments or in any sort of like

1714
01:18:59,327 --> 01:19:05,471
Russian spy

1715
01:19:05,727 --> 01:19:08,799
Started Overstock

1716
01:19:09,055 --> 01:19:10,335
Okay

1717
01:19:10,591 --> 01:19:13,663
Sia I Do I Do I Do by any of this so complicated

1718
01:19:13,919 --> 01:19:14,431
And

1719
01:19:14,943 --> 01:19:15,455
I can't

1720
01:19:15,711 --> 01:19:16,991
I just can't imagine any of this

1721
01:19:17,247 --> 01:19:23,391
You're dating also also government

1722
01:19:23,647 --> 01:19:26,975
On that

1723
01:19:27,231 --> 01:19:27,743
Appointment

1724
01:19:27,999 --> 01:19:29,279
That's said

1725
01:19:29,535 --> 01:19:31,583
This is also a staying on that Bag Man

1726
01:19:32,095 --> 01:19:33,887
Because that other government isn't going

1727
01:19:34,143 --> 01:19:37,983
They think that this is a real

1728
01:19:38,239 --> 01:19:38,751
He's playing

1729
01:19:39,007 --> 01:19:45,151
The bad man is not in the other foreign government is trying to entrap Hillary Clinton along with the help of the FBI

1730
01:19:45,407 --> 01:19:51,551
I don't think so the only people that I'm interested is turkey they want their money back I guess that's it the Overstock

1731
01:19:51,807 --> 01:19:52,575
Guy

1732
01:19:53,343 --> 01:19:56,671
I think the Patrick had a really reasonable response

1733
01:19:56,927 --> 01:19:59,487
To this man if I do this

1734
01:20:00,255 --> 01:20:01,279
Commit crimes

1735
01:20:01,791 --> 01:20:05,119
You better not arrest me for those crimes they commit in order to set this up

1736
01:20:05,375 --> 01:20:06,143
I need immunity

1737
01:20:06,399 --> 01:20:12,287
This sounds like somebody writing a much better movie where they didn't commit all the crimes that they did

1738
01:20:12,543 --> 01:20:13,567
Said they were not

1739
01:20:14,336 --> 01:20:15,104
This is this is

1740
01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:16,896
Is the clip where really turned

1741
01:20:17,152 --> 01:20:17,664
For me too

1742
01:20:17,920 --> 01:20:20,992
Probably like

1743
01:20:22,272 --> 01:20:25,344
They gave me that

1744
01:20:28,672 --> 01:20:30,208
There's going to be some

1745
01:20:30,464 --> 01:20:31,744
I need a

1746
01:21:15,264 --> 01:21:18,336
I said

1747
01:21:20,128 --> 01:21:21,408
Enough for me consider Hillary

1748
01:21:29,088 --> 01:21:31,648
Holyshit okay okay

1749
01:21:31,904 --> 01:21:33,696
Okay so this is why

1750
01:21:33,952 --> 01:21:35,232
This is 2015

1751
01:21:35,488 --> 01:21:36,000
Wow

1752
01:21:36,512 --> 01:21:39,328
Obama is like it's time to take Hill down

1753
01:21:40,352 --> 01:21:43,936
It's time to take her down I had her a Secretary of State for long enough

1754
01:21:44,448 --> 01:21:46,752
And now we just got to get rid of her well it starts

1755
01:21:47,264 --> 01:21:49,056
Makes sense when they come back from break

1756
01:21:49,312 --> 01:21:50,336
And they lay out more what

1757
01:21:50,592 --> 01:21:54,944
The conspiracy is here to put your head around like

1758
01:21:55,456 --> 01:21:55,968
Oh yes

1759
01:21:56,480 --> 01:21:59,296
Obama trying to stay Miller singing

1760
01:21:59,552 --> 01:22:01,344
Stop

1761
01:22:01,600 --> 01:22:02,368
Stop me real quick

1762
01:22:02,624 --> 01:22:04,928
If cuz I could be wrong is it

1763
01:22:05,184 --> 01:22:05,952
Regular practice

1764
01:22:06,208 --> 01:22:07,232
Just for the FBI

1765
01:22:07,488 --> 01:22:09,024
Do clandestinely come to you

1766
01:22:09,536 --> 01:22:10,048
And say

1767
01:22:10,304 --> 01:22:11,072
We need you to

1768
01:22:11,328 --> 01:22:11,840
Sing

1769
01:22:12,352 --> 01:22:13,120
The most

1770
01:22:13,376 --> 01:22:18,240
Famous woman in the world

1771
01:22:18,752 --> 01:22:19,520
I love you tell you this

1772
01:22:21,312 --> 01:22:22,336
We got no ideas

1773
01:22:22,848 --> 01:22:23,872
Go for it buddy

1774
01:22:24,128 --> 01:22:25,920
However you think you can make this

1775
01:22:26,176 --> 01:22:28,480
Sting happened we're not even giving you a hell

1776
01:22:28,736 --> 01:22:31,040
You're basically MacGyver

1777
01:22:32,576 --> 01:22:35,392
You know what to do

1778
01:22:35,648 --> 01:22:40,256
Look at the FBI don't like to micromanage

1779
01:22:42,816 --> 01:22:44,864
Companies that do your thing

1780
01:22:45,120 --> 01:22:46,144
Obama

1781
01:22:46,400 --> 01:22:47,424
Famously

1782
01:22:48,704 --> 01:22:53,568
Super spy guy from Overstock

1783
01:22:54,848 --> 01:22:58,944
Show me on this story more and more I'm imagining this guide

1784
01:22:59,456 --> 01:23:03,552
Play coming in from the ceiling on wires only image of spy work

1785
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:06,624
Come back from break

1786
01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:10,720
He said something really interesting okay makes me think like oh

1787
01:23:11,744 --> 01:23:14,304
He might know more about Alex than he's letting on

1788
01:23:18,912 --> 01:23:20,448
There is a coup

1789
01:23:23,264 --> 01:23:27,104
People

1790
01:23:27,616 --> 01:23:31,712
Anyway

1791
01:23:32,992 --> 01:23:39,136
The only thing is I want to be clear I have nothing

1792
01:23:45,280 --> 01:23:45,792
Call Pure crap

1793
01:23:46,304 --> 01:23:52,448
Why are you why why did you need to bring that up

1794
01:23:52,704 --> 01:23:56,288
People were saying that I don't believe in any of this white identitarian nonsense

1795
01:23:56,544 --> 01:23:57,824
Just in case anyone ass

1796
01:23:58,080 --> 01:23:59,872
Yeah that's why I don't know

1797
01:24:00,128 --> 01:24:03,968
Today is not taking as many media appearances

1798
01:24:04,224 --> 01:24:04,736
Some

1799
01:24:04,992 --> 01:24:07,552
Sure I've never found that I needed to distance

1800
01:24:07,808 --> 01:24:09,600
Myself from White identitarianism

1801
01:24:12,928 --> 01:24:15,744
If you do that kind of is because you know that the person

1802
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:16,512
You're talking to Mike

1803
01:24:19,584 --> 01:24:21,376
Nothing like being interviewed after Nick

1804
01:24:21,632 --> 01:24:22,912
Puentes

1805
01:24:23,168 --> 01:24:24,192
Yeah I mean

1806
01:24:24,448 --> 01:24:25,984
This is a really complicated

1807
01:24:26,240 --> 01:24:30,336
Kind of such a look before we go any further I just want to let you know that I do not

1808
01:24:30,592 --> 01:24:32,640
Support the actions of the thuggee cult

1809
01:24:32,896 --> 01:24:34,176
From Temple of Doom

1810
01:24:34,944 --> 01:24:39,040
I don't support that I don't know why I need to say that here

1811
01:24:39,296 --> 01:24:40,576
Raises questions

1812
01:24:40,832 --> 01:24:42,624
The Sting

1813
01:24:46,720 --> 01:24:47,232
Forgot

1814
01:24:48,512 --> 01:24:50,816
Cover up

1815
01:24:51,072 --> 01:24:53,376
So good how I pulled off

1816
01:24:53,632 --> 01:24:55,424
Probably the best thing.

1817
01:24:59,264 --> 01:25:00,032
When things fell apart.

1818
01:25:13,856 --> 01:25:14,880
From being president

1819
01:25:16,160 --> 01:25:19,232
Bodacious

1820
01:25:23,584 --> 01:25:24,096
Everyone

1821
01:25:31,264 --> 01:25:32,288
Dispassionate

1822
01:25:32,544 --> 01:25:33,312
And we mean it

1823
01:25:34,848 --> 01:25:37,152
Every moment of this

1824
01:25:37,408 --> 01:25:39,456
Wow

1825
01:25:39,968 --> 01:25:41,760
He can't be sure I understand

1826
01:25:42,528 --> 01:25:43,296
I do believe

1827
01:25:43,552 --> 01:25:44,576
Any of that none of it

1828
01:25:44,832 --> 01:25:46,624
But I want to be clear about something

1829
01:25:47,904 --> 01:25:48,416
If

1830
01:25:48,672 --> 01:25:50,208
You make a claim like this

1831
01:25:50,464 --> 01:25:54,304
What we should do as a society is immediately put you in front of like

1832
01:25:54,560 --> 01:25:55,840
The most serious Court

1833
01:25:56,096 --> 01:25:58,144
That is imaginable produced seven

1834
01:25:58,656 --> 01:26:00,192
Cuz the stakes of this are way too hot

1835
01:26:00,448 --> 01:26:01,984
Crazy if you are telling the truth

1836
01:26:02,496 --> 01:26:05,056
Mistakes and the importance for the public good

1837
01:26:05,312 --> 01:26:06,336
So important

1838
01:26:06,592 --> 01:26:07,616
But you cannot

1839
01:26:07,872 --> 01:26:08,640
Not proven

1840
01:26:08,896 --> 01:26:09,408
Absolutely

1841
01:26:09,664 --> 01:26:11,712
If you are lying you need to go to prison

1842
01:26:12,224 --> 01:26:15,040
Because the stakes are so serious and that side too

1843
01:26:15,296 --> 01:26:16,576
You can't be allowed tomato

1844
01:26:16,832 --> 01:26:17,856
These sorts of claims

1845
01:26:18,112 --> 01:26:21,696
That are about like International Espionage and like plots against

1846
01:26:22,208 --> 01:26:22,976
Society

1847
01:26:23,232 --> 01:26:25,280
Just do it with impunity

1848
01:26:25,536 --> 01:26:26,560
You can't prove this

1849
01:26:27,072 --> 01:26:28,608
You can't make claims like that

1850
01:26:28,864 --> 01:26:30,656
Right that's how I would that I would like to

1851
01:26:31,168 --> 01:26:33,216
Think Shaker system of pneumatic

1852
01:26:33,472 --> 01:26:36,544
Like tubes where you you make a claim like this and then all the sudden

1853
01:26:37,824 --> 01:26:43,968
And then you're in the Courtney like it should not be a situation

1854
01:26:44,224 --> 01:26:44,992
No like your

1855
01:26:45,504 --> 01:26:46,016
Punished

1856
01:26:46,272 --> 01:26:47,552
Punitive

1857
01:26:48,064 --> 01:26:49,856
Unless you clearly making this s*** up

1858
01:26:50,368 --> 01:26:50,880
Yeah

1859
01:26:51,648 --> 01:26:52,160
Just to

1860
01:26:52,672 --> 01:26:53,184
Too serious

1861
01:26:53,440 --> 01:26:56,768
No I think I know I think with with swings this big

1862
01:26:57,536 --> 01:27:00,352
We're not dealing with quite as much Nuance in the law

1863
01:27:00,864 --> 01:27:04,192
You know incredibly easy to prove very simple

1864
01:27:04,448 --> 01:27:06,496
Very simple like

1865
01:27:06,752 --> 01:27:07,264
If you selling

1866
01:27:07,520 --> 01:27:09,312
If there'd be so much

1867
01:27:09,568 --> 01:27:10,080
Documentation

1868
01:27:10,592 --> 01:27:13,920
I don't care about him saying you have to wipe it from your memory

1869
01:27:14,176 --> 01:27:17,248
Well guess what Hillary didn't become president do all that

1870
01:27:17,504 --> 01:27:18,016
Pier

1871
01:27:18,272 --> 01:27:20,064
Of her like reprising again

1872
01:27:20,320 --> 01:27:24,416
People didn't come to pass they're probably be tons of people within the FBI who would

1873
01:27:24,928 --> 01:27:31,072
Corroborate your story short I going to guess that you remember the bag man's name you would say maybe the country that

1874
01:27:31,328 --> 01:27:32,608
Bribed a Hillary

1875
01:27:32,864 --> 01:27:34,400
I I don't know

1876
01:27:34,656 --> 01:27:36,704
Offensive to me

1877
01:27:37,728 --> 01:27:39,264
The timeline of The Story Goes this

1878
01:27:39,520 --> 01:27:42,080
A December 2015 2015

1879
01:27:42,592 --> 01:27:43,104
Alright

1880
01:27:43,616 --> 01:27:45,920
He kicks ass on the sting gets all the way

1881
01:27:46,176 --> 01:27:52,320
To somewhere in 2015 where everybody in the higher-ups decided that Hillary going to win

1882
01:27:52,576 --> 01:27:54,624
Alright so they just decided that it's over right

1883
01:27:54,880 --> 01:27:56,928
And then Hillary doesn't win

1884
01:27:57,184 --> 01:27:59,232
And I believe that was the same year correct

1885
01:27:59,488 --> 01:28:02,048
Yeah and then there was the new president

1886
01:28:02,304 --> 01:28:02,816
Spawn

1887
01:28:03,840 --> 01:28:04,864
17

1888
01:28:05,120 --> 01:28:06,656
January

1889
01:28:06,912 --> 01:28:09,216
If I were somebody who would just

1890
01:28:09,472 --> 01:28:14,080
Successfully executed a sting operation

1891
01:28:14,336 --> 01:28:14,848
Hillary Clint

1892
01:28:15,104 --> 01:28:15,616
Bright

1893
01:28:15,872 --> 01:28:16,896
Who is Empresa

1894
01:28:17,152 --> 01:28:20,224
Someone who is famous at that it's not just not present

1895
01:28:20,480 --> 01:28:22,784
But someone who lost to the guy who screamed

1896
01:28:23,296 --> 01:28:24,320
Lock her up

1897
01:28:24,576 --> 01:28:29,440
Oh yeah in like a whole big crowds of people changing that to you to wait until after

1898
01:28:29,696 --> 01:28:30,720
He had lost his elect

1899
01:28:30,976 --> 01:28:31,488
Tell people

1900
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:33,280
I would go to him

1901
01:28:33,536 --> 01:28:34,048
Yet

1902
01:28:34,304 --> 01:28:34,816
Yeah

1903
01:28:35,072 --> 01:28:35,840
If you

1904
01:28:36,096 --> 01:28:37,120
If you were inclined

1905
01:28:37,376 --> 01:28:37,888
To take

1906
01:28:38,144 --> 01:28:38,656
The

1907
01:28:41,216 --> 01:28:41,984
Involved in

1908
01:28:42,752 --> 01:28:45,824
That kind of Espionage sting operation work again

1909
01:28:46,336 --> 01:28:47,360
Hillary Clinton

1910
01:28:48,128 --> 01:28:50,176
Involving a foreign government

1911
01:28:50,944 --> 01:28:52,992
You're willing to take those kinds of risks

1912
01:28:53,248 --> 01:28:54,784
I would assume yeah I bought

1913
01:28:55,040 --> 01:28:56,064
What's Trump won new be like

1914
01:28:56,320 --> 01:28:56,832
I

1915
01:28:57,344 --> 01:29:01,696
Got to do this whole thing

1916
01:29:01,952 --> 01:29:03,744
I did all the work

1917
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:04,768
It wasn't for nothing

1918
01:29:05,024 --> 01:29:07,584
They probably will let me do it

1919
01:29:08,352 --> 01:29:09,888
Like I'll put the handcuffs on her

1920
01:29:11,424 --> 01:29:12,192
It didn't happen because it

1921
01:29:12,704 --> 01:29:18,848
I'm going to go with that one yet I got Valentine's reasonable I was kind of confused about the idea that Obama was behind

1922
01:29:19,360 --> 01:29:21,408
But Patrick has clear that up here

1923
01:29:27,296 --> 01:29:27,808
Express

1924
01:29:30,368 --> 01:29:31,904
You need to understand

1925
01:29:32,160 --> 01:29:34,464
Play January 2016

1926
01:29:41,632 --> 01:29:42,400
People are different

1927
01:29:44,704 --> 01:29:47,776
Understand

1928
01:29:49,056 --> 01:29:51,104
Especially Department of Justice

1929
01:29:52,128 --> 01:29:55,968
Hillary Clinton

1930
01:30:03,136 --> 01:30:04,672
Bunsen burner

1931
01:30:04,928 --> 01:30:05,952
Information

1932
01:30:17,728 --> 01:30:18,752
Bad girl

1933
01:30:22,080 --> 01:30:23,104
And that way

1934
01:30:23,360 --> 01:30:25,152
Barack Obama

1935
01:30:30,528 --> 01:30:32,320
Find you don't want to step on this line

1936
01:30:36,160 --> 01:30:38,464
The story is too good Alex here interrupting

1937
01:30:39,488 --> 01:30:41,792
Do you know how many times people with an eidetic

1938
01:30:42,048 --> 01:30:42,816
Memory say

1939
01:30:43,072 --> 01:30:43,584
And this is worth

1940
01:30:43,840 --> 01:30:44,352
Forward reminder

1941
01:30:44,608 --> 01:30:46,144
They do say that a lot I would imagine

1942
01:30:46,400 --> 01:30:47,168
I don't know

1943
01:30:47,424 --> 01:30:48,960
They say it initially

1944
01:30:49,472 --> 01:30:51,264
One time and then you're like

1945
01:30:51,520 --> 01:30:55,360
You're telling the truth they don't repeat over and over and over again in the

1946
01:30:55,616 --> 01:30:56,128
The same story

1947
01:30:56,640 --> 01:30:57,408
Yeah

1948
01:30:58,432 --> 01:31:01,760
Obama was going to manage Hillary because he had this Leverage

1949
01:31:02,016 --> 01:31:07,392
Jon-hurwitz this this this the bribe that the Overstock

1950
01:31:07,648 --> 01:31:10,208
Right

1951
01:31:19,680 --> 01:31:21,984
And she's going to step down

1952
01:31:24,800 --> 01:31:27,616
Say that again cuz I did mess up the Bucs won

1953
01:31:28,128 --> 01:31:30,688
The bunch of Mars been turned upside down

1954
01:31:36,576 --> 01:31:40,416
Then she's going to step down and Michelle's going to

1955
01:31:41,696 --> 01:31:42,208
That's the plan

1956
01:31:42,720 --> 01:31:44,512
Well that makes perfect sense with

1957
01:31:46,560 --> 01:31:48,608
Literal zombie makeup

1958
01:31:48,864 --> 01:31:49,632
So much status

1959
01:31:50,400 --> 01:31:54,752
This ridiculous story that this dude is telling on your show he

1960
01:31:55,008 --> 01:31:55,520
Cake with

1961
01:31:55,776 --> 01:31:57,824
Out any kind of article

1962
01:31:58,080 --> 01:31:59,360
That just makes so much sense

1963
01:31:59,616 --> 01:32:01,664
No real follow-up questions as to what the

1964
01:32:01,920 --> 01:32:03,968
The f*** are you talking about

1965
01:32:04,224 --> 01:32:05,248
He gets to the end of the story

1966
01:32:05,504 --> 01:32:09,600
This was an Obama setup so he could blackmail Hillary and that 8 years

1967
01:32:09,856 --> 01:32:15,232
He beat the shadow president behind Hillary and then his wife would be president after that hahaha

1968
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:16,512
This is

1969
01:32:17,536 --> 01:32:18,816
Yeah

1970
01:32:19,584 --> 01:32:20,096
Yeah

1971
01:32:21,376 --> 01:32:21,888
BoBoiBoy

1972
01:32:22,144 --> 01:32:22,656
What kind of fun

1973
01:32:23,168 --> 01:32:23,680
It is kind

1974
01:32:24,960 --> 01:32:25,984
I do like this

1975
01:32:26,240 --> 01:32:27,008
He thinks that it

1976
01:32:27,264 --> 01:32:27,776
It's such a good

1977
01:32:28,032 --> 01:32:28,800
Great punchline

1978
01:32:29,056 --> 01:32:31,360
Find that it's Michelle. Going to run

1979
01:32:31,616 --> 01:32:32,384
You you under

1980
01:32:32,640 --> 01:32:35,200
Understand that we on Infowars

1981
01:32:35,456 --> 01:32:38,272
Have been screaming about Michelle Obama becoming president

1982
01:32:38,528 --> 01:32:39,552
Since 2009

1983
01:32:39,808 --> 01:32:40,320
Buddy

1984
01:32:40,576 --> 01:32:41,856
Verify

1985
01:32:42,112 --> 01:32:43,136
They've been on that train

1986
01:32:43,392 --> 01:32:47,488
For a while with a Michelle is the secret at the end of this

1987
01:32:47,744 --> 01:32:48,256
Conspiracy

1988
01:32:49,536 --> 01:32:50,304
I also just

1989
01:32:50,560 --> 01:32:51,072
I just don't

1990
01:32:51,584 --> 01:32:52,608
There's a

1991
01:32:52,864 --> 01:32:53,376
Good

1992
01:32:53,632 --> 01:32:54,656
Use for this

1993
01:32:54,912 --> 01:32:55,424
Conspiracy

1994
01:32:55,680 --> 01:32:59,776
Sure cuz it takes some of the agency away from their biggest bad

1995
01:33:00,032 --> 01:33:01,312
Person which is the clintons

1996
01:33:01,568 --> 01:33:04,896
No it's like McConnell the secret one was Obama

1997
01:33:05,152 --> 01:33:10,016
Hillary is like the devil that you have to be afraid of

1998
01:33:10,272 --> 01:33:12,064
It doesn't make sense for her to then be a

1999
01:33:12,320 --> 01:33:13,600
Hatsy of Obama

2000
01:33:14,112 --> 01:33:14,880
I get there

2001
01:33:15,392 --> 01:33:18,976
It's not emotionally unsatisfying now the Infowars universe

2002
01:33:19,488 --> 01:33:20,256
Also just

2003
01:33:20,512 --> 01:33:21,024
Approve any of

2004
01:33:21,792 --> 01:33:24,352
Dick I think it's a fun s*** talking

2005
01:33:24,608 --> 01:33:27,936
Can story and if you if you wrote this down and he was like I'm going to try it

2006
01:33:28,192 --> 01:33:29,216
Can sell this to people

2007
01:33:29,472 --> 01:33:31,008
One he needs to get better at

2008
01:33:31,264 --> 01:33:34,336
Is delivery because two adults

2009
01:33:34,592 --> 01:33:39,456
This delivery doesn't matter how bad it is without going to believe him

2010
01:33:39,712 --> 01:33:41,504
Patrick says he has two more bombshells

2011
01:33:41,760 --> 01:33:44,064
That are coming eventually

2012
01:33:44,576 --> 01:33:49,696
The weekday has speaker swing coming in the future

2013
01:33:49,952 --> 01:33:51,488
But we will have to wait

2014
01:33:51,744 --> 01:33:52,768
For those

2015
01:33:53,024 --> 01:33:53,792
Island love

2016
01:33:54,304 --> 01:33:56,096
Bombshells

2017
01:33:56,608 --> 01:33:57,376
Next Monday

2018
01:33:57,888 --> 01:34:00,960
Whenever you are we appreciate you would appreciate

2019
01:34:01,472 --> 01:34:03,776
Your time and thank you so much for coming on short notice

2020
01:34:11,456 --> 01:34:11,968
Hahaha

2021
01:34:12,736 --> 01:34:13,248
You'll be fine

2022
01:34:14,528 --> 01:34:20,672
Remind me of the Jerome corsi might die over the weekend you get a dead man switch

2023
01:34:21,696 --> 01:34:22,208
Oh man

2024
01:34:22,464 --> 01:34:24,256
No I can't come back on Monday Alex

2025
01:34:24,512 --> 01:34:30,400
This is going to take me at least another week to write to I mean I can't remember do know I have an eidetic memory I mean

2026
01:34:34,752 --> 01:34:37,312
Yet so that was that was an interesting kind of

2027
01:34:38,336 --> 01:34:39,360
I don't know change

2028
01:34:41,152 --> 01:34:42,944
I found that to be

2029
01:34:46,016 --> 01:34:46,528
Took down the garden

2030
01:34:46,784 --> 01:34:49,344
Path for a nice little walk at night

2031
01:34:49,856 --> 01:34:50,624
And we shall return

2032
01:34:50,880 --> 01:34:53,184
I also like the idea to that like

2033
01:34:53,696 --> 01:34:55,488
This picture guy is like

2034
01:34:55,744 --> 01:34:56,768
Clearly someone who has

2035
01:34:57,024 --> 01:34:57,536
Some status

2036
01:34:57,792 --> 01:34:58,816
At least in his own mind

2037
01:35:00,096 --> 01:35:02,912
Bechtel Alex you stepped on my punchline

2038
01:35:03,168 --> 01:35:05,216
Going to save you

2039
01:35:05,728 --> 01:35:06,496
View heart rate a lot

2040
01:35:06,752 --> 01:35:08,544
He has a little bit of flex

2041
01:35:09,824 --> 01:35:10,336
Kind of fun

2042
01:35:10,592 --> 01:35:14,688
That is what else was thinking like alright this guy's clearly little nutty

2043
01:35:16,992 --> 01:35:18,016
Is he the new Larry

2044
01:35:19,552 --> 01:35:20,576
Is he the new Larry Nichols

2045
01:35:23,648 --> 01:35:24,928
I wonder

2046
01:35:25,184 --> 01:35:25,696
Here's what I would

2047
01:35:27,744 --> 01:35:29,536
What city is wasn't on today

2048
01:35:30,048 --> 01:35:31,328
Now I'm wondering when

2049
01:35:31,840 --> 01:35:32,864
Exactly Stevie pieces

2050
01:35:34,144 --> 01:35:40,288
Probably tomorrow I don't know nothing going on between stevia

2051
01:35:40,544 --> 01:35:45,920
David Knight. Steve's not even for a little while so we got Overstock guy

2052
01:35:46,176 --> 01:35:46,688
To try and

2053
01:35:46,944 --> 01:35:48,224
Thread the needle of his

2054
01:35:48,480 --> 01:35:54,368
Steve and he has so much of the Steve and so much of the lariat

2055
01:35:54,624 --> 01:35:55,392
Put them in one

2056
01:35:55,648 --> 01:35:57,184
Yeah I don't know it's

2057
01:35:57,696 --> 01:36:00,512
It's tough for me because you know we got blindsided by this news

2058
01:36:00,768 --> 01:36:02,048
What about the the David Knight

2059
01:36:03,072 --> 01:36:06,400
As I look into the episode itself and you find that

2060
01:36:06,656 --> 01:36:07,424
Oh maybe there's

2061
01:36:08,960 --> 01:36:09,984
Or maybe this

2062
01:36:10,496 --> 01:36:11,776
Yet again Alex

2063
01:36:12,800 --> 01:36:13,312
Over

2064
01:36:13,568 --> 01:36:17,664
Playing some kind of a desperation to move product

2065
01:36:17,920 --> 01:36:20,480
Who knows I don't know I have no idea what's going on there

2066
01:36:20,736 --> 01:36:21,504
Things don't look good

2067
01:36:22,272 --> 01:36:24,576
Makes me even more suspicious

2068
01:36:26,112 --> 01:36:27,136
The day before

2069
01:36:27,392 --> 01:36:30,976
There's really no indication of anything that there's no trouble

2070
01:36:31,232 --> 01:36:32,256
He's promoting

2071
01:36:32,512 --> 01:36:34,304
Countdown

2072
01:36:34,560 --> 01:36:35,584
Countdown show

2073
01:36:35,840 --> 01:36:37,120
But now apparently

2074
01:36:37,376 --> 01:36:37,888
Continue

2075
01:36:38,144 --> 01:36:38,912
Yeah

2076
01:36:39,168 --> 01:36:40,960
It's it's a it's a little bit out of nowhere

2077
01:36:41,216 --> 01:36:42,752
Here's my here's my

2078
01:36:44,288 --> 01:36:45,056
On a mic

2079
01:36:45,312 --> 01:36:45,824
Conspiracy now

2080
01:36:46,592 --> 01:36:47,872
This is what I've got for you on this

2081
01:36:48,384 --> 01:36:48,896
Alright

2082
01:36:49,664 --> 01:36:50,688
Infowars

2083
01:36:51,200 --> 01:36:52,224
Not doing great right now

2084
01:36:52,736 --> 01:36:55,296
Not going to go out of business but they're not doing great right now

2085
01:36:55,808 --> 01:36:57,088
Okay I need some

2086
01:36:57,344 --> 01:36:58,112
Star this is this

2087
01:36:58,368 --> 01:37:00,928
Little couple of weeks you know what everybody takes a Christmas

2088
01:37:01,184 --> 01:37:01,696
Miss vacation

2089
01:37:02,208 --> 01:37:02,976
And if you

2090
01:37:03,232 --> 01:37:04,512
You took of Christmas Vacation

2091
01:37:05,024 --> 01:37:05,536
That would be

2092
01:37:06,048 --> 01:37:08,864
That exciting we're in the middle of fighting the goddamn infowar

2093
01:37:09,376 --> 01:37:10,912
How do you go out on vacation

2094
01:37:11,168 --> 01:37:13,472
I see what you're doing what we do is

2095
01:37:13,728 --> 01:37:14,496
We say we got to let

2096
01:37:14,752 --> 01:37:17,824
Hugo I save money on overhead cost for a

2097
01:37:18,080 --> 01:37:18,592
Couple of weeks

2098
01:37:18,848 --> 01:37:22,432
After the big Christmas sale weekend

2099
01:37:22,688 --> 01:37:26,272
Merry Christmas and we get all the money in and then I'm like

2100
01:37:26,528 --> 01:37:27,296
Guys

2101
01:37:27,808 --> 01:37:31,392
And weary to exactly

2102
01:37:32,416 --> 01:37:36,512
Yeah that would be interesting I will be in I don't know if they can pull that off I don't think so either

2103
01:37:37,792 --> 01:37:38,304
I'm interested

2104
01:37:38,560 --> 01:37:39,328
Did you see what ends up happening

2105
01:37:40,096 --> 01:37:41,888
But not that interested

2106
01:37:42,400 --> 01:37:42,912
Sure

2107
01:37:45,728 --> 01:37:46,240
To make me interests

2108
01:37:46,752 --> 01:37:47,776
Gas

2109
01:37:48,032 --> 01:37:49,312
Mecare make me care fight

2110
01:37:49,568 --> 01:37:54,432
Do something for my amusement the other thing too that I think is is really key is that like

2111
01:37:55,456 --> 01:37:55,968
Alex is a

2112
01:37:56,224 --> 01:37:58,272
About to enter a very profitable space

2113
01:37:58,528 --> 01:38:00,576
Which is returning to the

2114
01:38:00,832 --> 01:38:02,368
Attacking the GOP

2115
01:38:03,136 --> 01:38:04,672
Like Purity in the GOP

2116
01:38:04,928 --> 01:38:06,720
You kind of thing is really really

2117
01:38:07,744 --> 01:38:08,768
Profitable

2118
01:38:09,536 --> 01:38:11,328
Store like right-wing talk shows

2119
01:38:11,584 --> 01:38:12,352
That's worked for million

2120
01:38:12,864 --> 01:38:13,376
Right

2121
01:38:13,632 --> 01:38:14,144
But

2122
01:38:15,168 --> 01:38:16,704
He also has never had to do it

2123
01:38:16,960 --> 01:38:18,240
Wow there were

2124
01:38:18,752 --> 01:38:19,264
Large

2125
01:38:19,776 --> 01:38:20,288
Funded

2126
01:38:21,568 --> 01:38:22,336
Competitors

2127
01:38:22,848 --> 01:38:24,128
And I don't know if

2128
01:38:24,384 --> 01:38:25,664
He can be

2129
01:38:25,920 --> 01:38:26,432
Oan

2130
01:38:26,688 --> 01:38:27,200
Yeah it's

2131
01:38:27,456 --> 01:38:29,504
Difficult whenever you also have like

2132
01:38:30,528 --> 01:38:36,672
Because before you had Fox News crash in the Tea Party Wing just like

2133
01:38:36,928 --> 01:38:37,440
Killing everybody

2134
01:38:37,952 --> 01:38:40,512
But Alex even then still got to exist in that space

2135
01:38:41,536 --> 01:38:42,048
Everybody

2136
01:38:42,304 --> 01:38:45,888
Sucks and I hate them all but Obama's the devil into that whole thing

2137
01:38:46,400 --> 01:38:47,424
But Fox News wasn't

2138
01:38:47,680 --> 01:38:48,448
Also Hayden

2139
01:38:49,216 --> 01:38:49,728
Mitch McConnell at

2140
01:38:50,240 --> 01:38:53,312
No they did have going back being a little nutty

2141
01:38:53,568 --> 01:38:54,848
Conspiracy

2142
01:38:55,104 --> 01:39:01,248
But like to have two networks that they computer you know what I'm saying

2143
01:39:01,504 --> 01:39:03,296
Alex did have some competition in the

2144
01:39:03,552 --> 01:39:04,832
The form of Glenn Beck's

2145
01:39:05,088 --> 01:39:05,856
It was still like

2146
01:39:06,112 --> 01:39:08,416
He would say a lot of s*** The Glenn Beck probably wouldn't

2147
01:39:09,440 --> 01:39:09,952
And so

2148
01:39:10,464 --> 01:39:10,976
I don't know

2149
01:39:11,232 --> 01:39:12,256
I don't I don't know

2150
01:39:12,512 --> 01:39:13,792
Substantially what he can do

2151
01:39:14,048 --> 01:39:15,072
To differentiate himself

2152
01:39:15,584 --> 01:39:17,632
From the competitors now but

2153
01:39:17,888 --> 01:39:20,704
Job I think it's the only thing he could do and I don't think he's capable of

2154
01:39:20,960 --> 01:39:27,104
Overstock guy I don't think it's possible

2155
01:39:30,688 --> 01:39:31,200
Folks

2156
01:39:38,880 --> 01:39:44,768
We are victorious Dallas drivers local charity or bail Fund in your area to help out those doing

2157
01:39:45,536 --> 01:39:47,072
Right now
