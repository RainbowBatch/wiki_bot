1
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:04,864
Holding

2
00:00:06,656 --> 00:00:12,800
Alexandra Thurston color

3
00:00:13,056 --> 00:00:16,384
We're couple dudes like sit around drink novelty beverages

4
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:22,784
But Alex Jones modus operandi

5
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:24,064
Some sort of like

6
00:00:24,576 --> 00:00:25,088
Okay

7
00:00:25,344 --> 00:00:27,136
So if you were going to see the new Star Wars

8
00:00:27,648 --> 00:00:28,416
A boyfriend

9
00:00:31,744 --> 00:00:33,280
If there was a like

10
00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:35,584
You know you're not too interested

11
00:00:36,096 --> 00:00:37,376
No not really really Earth

12
00:00:37,632 --> 00:00:40,960
So what if I told you

13
00:00:42,496 --> 00:00:44,032
I don't believe that it on

14
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:52,224
Star Wars Star Wars as a whole this movie has a hook

15
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:55,808
Okay alright. John popper

16
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:01,696
All Blues Traveler episode

17
00:01:01,952 --> 00:01:03,744
Just like that hook

18
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,144
So do we have a hook and that is I know I don't know a goddamn thing about that is correct

19
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,728
We're going to be jumping on ovaries

20
00:01:13,984 --> 00:01:20,128
Last week's Friday's episode

21
00:01:21,152 --> 00:01:21,664
B-17

22
00:01:22,176 --> 00:01:23,968
Nonsense goes down

23
00:01:25,248 --> 00:01:31,392
Standard deduction s***'s f***** up

24
00:01:31,648 --> 00:01:36,768
Audio drop

25
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:39,840
Here is an out-of-context drop

26
00:01:40,096 --> 00:01:41,376
Valex from that episode

27
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:45,728
Jesus loves State and kill your children

28
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:47,776
So

29
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:54,176
Alex's World here at the middle of December

30
00:01:54,432 --> 00:02:00,320
The two-year anniversary of him losing his soul in joining up with Team Trump

31
00:02:00,576 --> 00:02:04,160
Alex is a precarious position

32
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:11,328
Thank you probably did it one point all humans are I don't know what sold exist let's move on from that

33
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:23,360
Soap

34
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:27,456
U.s. me before the show is this going to be some Roy more s***

35
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:30,272
No it's not he's already moved on from that loss

36
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:38,208
Meaning everybody

37
00:02:38,464 --> 00:02:41,024
Get the f*** out

38
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,304
Guess what

39
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:48,704
Now we all agree or pedophile surprised you go to jail

40
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:51,520
It wasn't me

41
00:02:57,664 --> 00:03:01,248
Give me crazy

42
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:10,208
Shaggy wasn't me

43
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:14,560
Alex the day after

44
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:21,984
Anyway

45
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:27,104
After the the election the Alabama

46
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:28,128
Centauri election

47
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:34,784
Alex tried to paint a bunch of airsoft narratives about voter suppression against

48
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:40,672
Lenny tried to start up a conspiracy theory about

49
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:43,744
Them not maintaining the voting records

50
00:03:46,816 --> 00:03:48,608
Decision Alabama Supreme Court decision

51
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:50,912
That the Democrats in the globalist for trying to

52
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:53,728
People wearing they wouldn't

53
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:56,032
Keep that maintain be the records

54
00:03:58,848 --> 00:04:00,384
Brilliantly

55
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,152
First

56
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:04,480
Putting all Republicans as Supreme Court Justice

57
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:08,320
This is an Alabama brilliant moves

58
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:15,744
Fostering

59
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,119
And that's how the Democrats came up with this brilliant plan

60
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:22,911
And what was the result

61
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:27,007
It's so it's so convoluted

62
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:31,615
Pretty quick Alex realized

63
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:40,319
He's like on that narrative

64
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:44,927
Tar and feather Andrew McCabe and Rod Rosen

65
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:52,095
Because because I think you started to get the reality in mine but like

66
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:54,143
We're doing a lot of work

67
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:55,167
Trying to get

68
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:56,703
Trump to fire Mueller

69
00:04:57,215 --> 00:05:00,799
But even if Trump fires Mueller

70
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:07,199
I believe you can I think you can

71
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:13,599
Forces apartment of a special counsel

72
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:19,487
I think he can and I think it would be a massive disaster just be like

73
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:24,095
Uno does someone to replace him

74
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:25,631
And keep the investigation going

75
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:27,423
Is a much better idea

76
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:30,239
Who attacked the Department of Justice itself

77
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:32,031
Bees RV Rock

78
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:34,079
Show

79
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:35,359
Right so

80
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:40,991
In a lot of the work he's doing is

81
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:42,015
Through the

82
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:43,295
Discussion of those Tech

83
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:45,599
That will came out between the FBI age

84
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:50,463
The biggest story in the history of the world

85
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:53,535
People were texting each other that Trump was an idiot

86
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:58,911
And it turns out they also were talking s*** on Hillary and Sanders to along the way

87
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:03,775
Course but the more important thing is the reason that they were communicating

88
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:05,055
This guy

89
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:06,591
Struck

90
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:11,199
His name is work phone

91
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:17,599
They're using those phone because if they use their other phones they might get caught by their spouses they were

92
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:18,879
Right

93
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:20,159
That's really more

94
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:27,071
I don't really think that there is much compelling s*** going on here every

95
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:28,351
Publican politician

96
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:34,751
To not to release their text messages around the Trump campaign

97
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:37,055
I'll have

98
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:43,455
Very worst what are we going to do everybody

99
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:49,599
So he spent a lot of time on that and we don't really need to go over that too much cuz I really just don't think there's much

100
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:55,231
But there is one funny moment

101
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:56,511
It repairs

102
00:06:58,047 --> 00:07:00,863
Alex is turning on Paul Ryan a good bit

103
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:05,983
You never really liked him that much the darling of the last

104
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:10,079
Call Ryan

105
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:12,895
Darling of the

106
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:20,575
So I guess that means we're allowed to kill the ones we loved her from the

107
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:24,671
Thursday show actually because I got I actually cut the switch accident

108
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:27,231
What they're worth it

109
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:31,839
Thursday animal

110
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:37,471
They're relevant because

111
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:43,871
That whole McCabe Rosenstein narrative really present as much on Friday but it's been a big party

112
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:46,943
Before you get into the clip

113
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:47,967
Do you think people have

114
00:07:57,951 --> 00:08:03,839
Criminals and scum and world

115
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:07,423
Get-togethers

116
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:24,063
A bunch of chicken

117
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:27,135
People that have

118
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:36,863
Group of garbage

119
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:45,055
The people that robbed

120
00:08:54,015 --> 00:09:00,159
So they're the good guys work on people

121
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:09,887
And it doesn't work on me makeup whatever you want

122
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:15,007
Do whatever you want

123
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:18,335
You are all going to prison

124
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:21,663
I think he's projecting a little bit understand

125
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:27,039
Wait so first thing he says is about Rosenstein

126
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:30,367
Landoll's

127
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:36,767
Yeah it's all these liberals or completely divorced from any real

128
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:43,167
Supposing some sort of belief in

129
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:53,919
The alphas would never do right

130
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:55,967
What are we talkin about

131
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:58,527
The remnants

132
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:05,439
Intellectual tradition of the men's rights activist communities

133
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:10,303
Operating officer

134
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:14,655
Half remember things

135
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:18,495
What he's expressing those eyes

136
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:20,543
I mean I guess

137
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:27,199
I guess if you've seen Revenge of the Nerds in your a lady that's probably trailer

138
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:28,479
Did not

139
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:34,879
Evan goes into how the betas are actually understandable and doing what they're doing

140
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:36,159
Because they're watching the

141
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:37,695
The country get taken apart

142
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:39,743
Answer there

143
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:41,279
I think he flips

144
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:43,583
Probably I think that's my issue

145
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:46,911
Alex is being intellectually consist of

146
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:50,751
He's saying I believe is that

147
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:53,055
These betas

148
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:56,639
They hate the country because they're robbing it

149
00:10:58,943 --> 00:11:01,759
They're the ones Robin with his pronoun

150
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:03,551
That's what really is going on

151
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:08,415
This next Thursday the 14th

152
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:12,511
More troubling cuz he spent a good bit of the show

153
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:15,071
Really just playing clips of Putin

154
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:16,607
Hattiesburg

155
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:19,679
I mean now

156
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:22,495
Here's here's a

157
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:25,311
Dogshit analysis

158
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:26,079
He's going to throw in

159
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:34,271
Powers of the president

160
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:40,671
Respectful

161
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:52,703
Your media

162
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:56,031
Your will and what you did constitutionally

163
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:15,487
Please give me a text to Christopher Steele Stephen

164
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:16,767
Okay

165
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:17,791
What

166
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:22,399
According to Alex

167
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:26,751
The media is trying to disrespect the public

168
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:32,895
Which is greater made it seem like they're not I feel like we are all trying to disrespect the public that is f******

169
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:33,663
Stupid

170
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:40,319
There is that but it it feeds into Alex's narratives about fake news turns out

171
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:42,111
Those are

172
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:45,695
Russia's objectives to begin with so Alex is really

173
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:50,303
Now mirroring back to his already mirrored from

174
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:51,327
Sources

175
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:54,655
So interested

176
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:57,727
Does drawings of optical illusions with his mirrors bounce

177
00:12:57,983 --> 00:13:04,127
Weather forecast

178
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:04,895
Responding

179
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:09,759
Saying things he remembers and recognizes from his own Meredith

180
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:12,575
Let themselves were mirroring Russian narrative

181
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:14,879
It's very strange

182
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:16,927
I love

183
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:17,951
There's something

184
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:20,511
Regardless of how you feel

185
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:22,815
Having the balls

186
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:24,863
If you are

187
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:25,887
A Russian

188
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:26,655
Person

189
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:28,191
To go on TV

190
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:32,287
They don't respect the will of the American people

191
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:33,567
Batman

192
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:36,127
It's why I think I love that more than

193
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:42,527
The election with Liza

194
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:45,855
You don't even respect your people

195
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:52,255
Extremist opinion

196
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:54,815
Tension and

197
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:55,839
Rick

198
00:13:56,095 --> 00:14:02,239
Populist Uprising behind a very easily black mailable

199
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:08,639
Deeply in debt guy who surrounded by mobsters

200
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:15,039
There is a little

201
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:21,183
Coronavirus Coronavirus

202
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:21,951
Most of

203
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:24,767
What I found interesting on Thursday and accidentally

204
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:26,559
Eclipse

205
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:28,095
Talk with Rodger Stone

206
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:31,679
Any sort of speculators

207
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:33,215
Let's go

208
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:35,775
Bring up that Amicus brief

209
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:40,895
Know that John Brennan and Clapper

210
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:47,295
And 14 other people signed an amicus brief everybody who knows classified information is like

211
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:49,343
Tell you why

212
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:50,879
We we know things

213
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:52,927
We Can't Tell You Why

214
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:05,727
With your classified information it's very clear you're like

215
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:08,031
We have to protect

216
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:21,855
Stop worrying about a lot of those laws that made sense before we had a lunatic and charge

217
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:26,975
Maybe you don't like it shouldn't

218
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:31,327
Normally we would never do

219
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:34,399
It's a bad idea to release classified information

220
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:36,959
Don't know what the response really will be

221
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:38,239
Also

222
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:43,359
Trump is a criminal but communicated with the Russian government to steal our election

223
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:49,759
Rodger stone is involved and that means a local cut out clearly copper

224
00:15:54,367 --> 00:16:00,511
If I was a Russian agent he's opened up the door to accepting like

225
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:02,559
Unwillingly done some shyt

226
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:05,631
But I still think that even simonette

227
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:12,543
Funny guys

228
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:16,383
Ray Charles America in America I mean

229
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:22,783
I've been saying that for years I think those would you need to take away from all that is that even just

230
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:24,831
Eve

231
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:25,599
Like

232
00:16:27,135 --> 00:16:31,231
Crazy we don't usually do this but here's the

233
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:32,255
Here's the truth

234
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:36,863
They don't usually do that they all signs at

235
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:38,143
Is crazy

236
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:45,567
Unprecedented swordplay

237
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:51,967
People who have lifelong careers in National Security

238
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:52,991
Information

239
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:53,759
Stuff

240
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:55,807
You know like clandestine s***

241
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:56,831
Think they can't

242
00:16:57,087 --> 00:16:58,879
Go against their operating

243
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:04,255
Turtle conditioning Tire life

244
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:08,095
We got to get some bettas in there because bettas

245
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:09,375
Probably right

246
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:11,167
So let's get the Friday

247
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:12,191
Friday

248
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:14,239
Is a wild ride

249
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:15,263
Until we die

250
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:19,615
You're selling this real strong

251
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:23,455
There's a lot of nonsense

252
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:24,223
Okay

253
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:30,623
My standard

254
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:32,671
Women who are accusing

255
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:37,279
Trump of stuff are liars

256
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:39,839
That they're liars and Beyond

257
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:41,375
A great deal of time

258
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:42,399
Critiquing there a

259
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:45,983
So we're talking about the women who accused Trump of sexual assault

260
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:49,311
Just say that he asked for their phone number

261
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:50,847
That's what he thinks

262
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:51,871
The whole thing is about

263
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:55,967
Thinks that's what you telling his audience about

264
00:17:56,735 --> 00:17:57,759
The Trump was like hey

265
00:17:58,783 --> 00:18:01,087
I want to take you out on a date like we're in the

266
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:07,487
I would like your number but I would like your father to accompany us so we both know that Noah kind of hanky-panky

267
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:10,047
And those women

268
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:11,839
So impolitely

269
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:12,607
Said

270
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:13,375
No thank you

271
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:18,239
Yes and then beyond that his further narrative is that everyone's getting paid to lie about

272
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:21,567
Let's start with the first clip

273
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:24,639
Beware Alex's feelings lie about the

274
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:29,503
He wants that we need to both probably work out more we're both getting wet

275
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:38,207
Reception

276
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:45,631
Ugly

277
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:47,423
Calling ugly

278
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:52,031
I think it's in the realm of what you would call it certainly no

279
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:05,087
Absolutely I feel like I feel like some people I have made those i+

280
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:05,855
Claim

281
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:08,415
It's certainly not what Alex is doing

282
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:10,719
Yeah

283
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:12,511
Like that just continues

284
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:14,559
Like you says that over and over

285
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:16,607
Just like this

286
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:18,911
Stuff like that

287
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:20,191
That sort of thing

288
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:23,263
Even if you are a propaganda

289
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:24,543
With nothing

290
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:26,591
Why would you go that route

291
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:29,663
It's so it looks so bad

292
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:31,199
Looks like you have nothing

293
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:35,295
Because if you are a white supremacist

294
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:37,087
List which I would argue

295
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:38,623
9295

296
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:39,647
Percent of his audience

297
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:41,951
Yeah that idea of like

298
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:45,279
You're not pretty enough for me to rape you is a

299
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:49,631
Threat

300
00:19:50,143 --> 00:19:52,191
Tastic

301
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:55,775
Parliamentary

302
00:19:56,031 --> 00:19:57,311
There's a dude who's in the parliament

303
00:19:57,823 --> 00:19:59,871
Who is Ben Affleck

304
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:04,735
Grand old dictatorship that they had before

305
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:08,063
Famously said to Dilma Rousseff

306
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:09,343
The prime minister

307
00:20:09,855 --> 00:20:12,159
You're too ugly for me to rape you

308
00:20:12,927 --> 00:20:13,951
Right yeah

309
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:17,279
So that to me seems like a signal to those guys have like

310
00:20:17,535 --> 00:20:18,815
Well of course I would

311
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:21,631
Of course

312
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:23,679
Much like me insofar as

313
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:24,703
He would help

314
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:28,031
I guess that's sort of evil

315
00:20:28,287 --> 00:20:34,431
What cuz it does sort of imply that if they were more attractive it would be believable as the behavior is believable

316
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:38,015
Not good

317
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:44,159
No that is of course but only for the pretty women who haven't yet

318
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:45,183
I meant

319
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:51,583
Hoo boy that's not a good start

320
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:55,679
Credit these women Alex refers to a story that came out in the hill

321
00:20:57,215 --> 00:20:57,983
Is that

322
00:20:58,239 --> 00:20:59,263
Has to do with

323
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:05,663
Some high-powered lawyers going around about Trump

324
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:09,503
Explain why I don't

325
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:15,903
Affirm

326
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:35,104
The 750000 dollars

327
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,856
Poems for the good of the country

328
00:21:49,184 --> 00:21:55,072
Outfits for the greater cuz you know he's a misogynist and you know sex is ready but just yet let's just

329
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:04,544
We own the story also I saw 300

330
00:22:18,112 --> 00:22:19,136
So that's not good

331
00:22:19,392 --> 00:22:21,184
He should not be referencing the tapes

332
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:22,208
I've been

333
00:22:22,464 --> 00:22:24,512
Told about them also

334
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:26,560
Also you should be reporting this

335
00:22:27,072 --> 00:22:28,864
Best second hand

336
00:22:29,376 --> 00:22:33,472
And he's just making up these lurid details about like to come and knock on your door

337
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:37,568
Teleprompter

338
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:38,592
Good that

339
00:22:40,128 --> 00:22:41,408
If these tapes are real

340
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:44,224
Even if that's true that's bad reporting

341
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:47,040
I've been told about the tapes

342
00:22:50,624 --> 00:22:51,648
That's not good

343
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:58,304
It's not necessarily unusual you don't you don't get about dope

344
00:22:58,816 --> 00:23:00,352
There are a lot of times where it's like

345
00:23:00,608 --> 00:23:06,752
Unnamed sources in the government have told me and you're like well that's bulshit he has the right to rule

346
00:23:07,264 --> 00:23:09,824
Yes the right to report that someone is told me there are

347
00:23:10,336 --> 00:23:13,152
He doesn't have the right to do an improv scene where he ripped

348
00:23:13,664 --> 00:23:18,272
Content

349
00:23:18,528 --> 00:23:20,064
Implying the level of knowledge

350
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:21,088
He does not have

351
00:23:21,344 --> 00:23:22,624
If you listen to the tape

352
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:23,904
Why don't you

353
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,184
Tell us what's on the tapes

354
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:29,280
Also apparently with these dates are about

355
00:23:29,792 --> 00:23:35,680
Lisa Bloom Lisa Bloom is the person who allegedly has gone

356
00:23:35,936 --> 00:23:37,216
Tried to offer women money

357
00:23:37,472 --> 00:23:40,288
To come out and make up stories about Trump if you believe that that's what the

358
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,336
Narrative isn't with the tapes

359
00:23:42,592 --> 00:23:43,616
I don't give a s***

360
00:23:44,128 --> 00:23:46,688
Whatever Lisa Bloom was doing

361
00:23:46,944 --> 00:23:50,528
I don't think was related to anybody in any official capacity

362
00:23:50,784 --> 00:23:52,832
Even if this is true

363
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:56,416
She was the person who was defending Harvey Weinstein

364
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:01,792
When the allegations came out and then sort of dude I got a distance

365
00:24:02,048 --> 00:24:02,560
Myself

366
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:05,632
When Ronan Farrow was coming out with his pieces

367
00:24:05,888 --> 00:24:12,032
About 70 was working on the pieces about Weinstein

368
00:24:12,288 --> 00:24:16,896
She actually offered him opposition research on Rose McGowan

369
00:24:17,152 --> 00:24:19,712
Trying to discredit victims

370
00:24:19,968 --> 00:24:20,736
Preemptively

371
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:23,040
So I don't really give a s*** what you was doing

372
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:26,112
I don't think I I think that she has no purchase

373
00:24:26,624 --> 00:24:30,208
Here in terms of being working for any official

374
00:24:30,464 --> 00:24:32,000
Globalist

375
00:24:36,096 --> 00:24:36,608
No

376
00:24:38,656 --> 00:24:43,264
I don't care if this is true then you have a s*** head doing s*** head things

377
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,800
You don't have

378
00:24:46,592 --> 00:24:50,432
Exactly different version of project veritas

379
00:24:51,712 --> 00:24:53,248
Like a concerted effort

380
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:59,904
Buy all the anti Trump forces using Lisa Bloom to do this

381
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:04,768
All of these people who are allegedly on tape are not the people who have come forward

382
00:25:05,536 --> 00:25:11,680
So even if Lisa Bloom is running some weird Rogue activity that doesn't discredit the p

383
00:25:11,936 --> 00:25:13,472
People who have come out already

384
00:25:13,728 --> 00:25:16,544
It only does in s******* Minds were like

385
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:22,944
Is that why why

386
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:27,552
Would you do this more than enough already

387
00:25:28,576 --> 00:25:31,392
I don't I don't have a whole lot of respect for her at this point

388
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:34,464
So Alex is on is on a hot tip

389
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:37,024
About about sexual harassment stuff he wants

390
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:40,096
To make sure we talked about all of it except for Trump and Roy mowers

391
00:25:40,608 --> 00:25:42,912
So he gets to Astoria Kansas City

392
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:45,216
About the representative

393
00:25:45,472 --> 00:25:47,776
Misogynistic

394
00:25:50,848 --> 00:25:53,408
Renton General naturally esoteric

395
00:25:53,664 --> 00:25:54,176
Perfect

396
00:25:59,296 --> 00:26:00,832
Kan Jam

397
00:26:01,344 --> 00:26:04,416
Andrea Ramsey accused of sexual harassment

398
00:26:04,672 --> 00:26:06,976
Will drop out of us

399
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:08,000
CalFresh

400
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:10,816
And Congress

401
00:26:13,888 --> 00:26:20,032
Kansas City Star ask her about accusation 2005 lawsuit that she sexually harassed and

402
00:26:22,336 --> 00:26:24,896
Who said he had projected advances

403
00:26:28,224 --> 00:26:28,736
Good

404
00:26:28,992 --> 00:26:29,504
Goodbye

405
00:26:31,296 --> 00:26:35,648
I'm older woman

406
00:26:36,672 --> 00:26:41,280
Advances and she has any power over there more vindictive than the cases I've seen with a

407
00:26:42,048 --> 00:26:42,560
Weather

408
00:26:47,168 --> 00:26:47,936
Bookcases

409
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:51,776
And you are the victim of such a case

410
00:26:52,032 --> 00:26:56,128
Let's remember that Harvey Weinstein Mossad to follow women

411
00:26:58,944 --> 00:27:01,504
Let's think about the level of vindictive there

412
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:02,528
Like some lady

413
00:27:02,784 --> 00:27:05,088
I looked into this and what the

414
00:27:05,344 --> 00:27:11,488
I'm inclined to believe the guy I don't I don't I don't know all the particulars of all other details

415
00:27:11,744 --> 00:27:12,512
Chances are

416
00:27:12,768 --> 00:27:15,584
Well the reason that you dropped out still claims

417
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,120
Some form of MSN

418
00:27:17,632 --> 00:27:20,192
The reason that you

419
00:27:20,448 --> 00:27:25,056
Liberals and Democrats have implemented

420
00:27:25,312 --> 00:27:26,592
So there's a zero tolerance

421
00:27:26,848 --> 00:27:29,408
It's for people who harass subordinate

422
00:27:29,664 --> 00:27:33,504
Just-in-time right we got there yeah now I guess

423
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:38,368
But the situation is there's a guy who works for her and she had proposition

424
00:27:43,232 --> 00:27:44,512
He said he claims it

425
00:27:44,768 --> 00:27:47,072
The office

426
00:27:47,328 --> 00:27:48,096
Just ignored him

427
00:27:48,352 --> 00:27:49,888
His career suffered because of it

428
00:27:50,144 --> 00:27:55,008
I like I said I believe him I don't put that level of vindictiveness

429
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,544
He's very bad

430
00:27:57,056 --> 00:27:58,592
But it's not getting massage

431
00:27:59,104 --> 00:28:00,128
Involved

432
00:28:00,384 --> 00:28:06,528
Although there are a mean Meek Mill is going to prison for two years because of a rogue sexual

433
00:28:06,784 --> 00:28:07,552
Play harassing judge

434
00:28:07,808 --> 00:28:09,856
Interesting

435
00:28:10,112 --> 00:28:13,952
Think about this so Meek Mill everything about this

436
00:28:14,208 --> 00:28:20,352
Meek Mill is a very very talented

437
00:28:20,608 --> 00:28:21,632
Beef

438
00:28:25,216 --> 00:28:28,032
He was on probation for

439
00:28:28,288 --> 00:28:30,080
Play longer than his

440
00:28:30,336 --> 00:28:32,128
Crime would ever have

441
00:28:32,896 --> 00:28:34,176
Warranted

442
00:28:34,432 --> 00:28:35,968
Mainly because this judge

443
00:28:36,736 --> 00:28:38,272
Kept following him around like

444
00:28:38,528 --> 00:28:41,088
When he was doing charity work

445
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,624
She would show up

446
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:46,976
She would tell him that he needs to put her name and song

447
00:28:47,232 --> 00:28:53,376
He needs to do remixes of like Boys to Men song and reference

448
00:28:53,632 --> 00:28:54,144
So f****** thing

449
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:58,496
Every probation officer is like why is this guy been on probation

450
00:28:58,752 --> 00:29:01,568
For three years when it was only supposed to be like 6 months

451
00:29:01,824 --> 00:29:04,896
Start it never seen anything like it in this particular case

452
00:29:05,152 --> 00:29:06,944
That's crazy he just got

453
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:07,712
He just

454
00:29:07,968 --> 00:29:08,736
Went to prison

455
00:29:08,992 --> 00:29:10,784
For violating his probation

456
00:29:12,064 --> 00:29:12,832
What you shouldn't have been on it

457
00:29:13,088 --> 00:29:13,600
Exact

458
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,416
In his capacity of

459
00:29:16,928 --> 00:29:17,440
Traveling

460
00:29:17,696 --> 00:29:18,976
As a

461
00:29:19,232 --> 00:29:20,768
Very very talented

462
00:29:21,024 --> 00:29:22,048
Performing shows

463
00:29:22,304 --> 00:29:25,376
Which he got permission to do from his probation office

464
00:29:25,888 --> 00:29:27,168
And this

465
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:32,288
She then claimed that she never received the email and never signed off on it even though

466
00:29:32,544 --> 00:29:34,080
We have records that you did

467
00:29:34,336 --> 00:29:35,360
Not on appeal

468
00:29:35,616 --> 00:29:39,712
Meek Mill will get out but he's going to be in prison for a while

469
00:29:39,968 --> 00:29:43,296
Elementary

470
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,744
Disgusting

471
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,280
Powerslide garbage

472
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:03,264
It's just the sentiment diseases modern culture culture.

473
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,592
You're getting it

474
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:16,320
101

475
00:30:18,624 --> 00:30:19,904
Torturing killing kids

476
00:30:31,424 --> 00:30:32,448
Retail stuff

477
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,240
Thomas jump start going away

478
00:30:35,008 --> 00:30:36,800
What is

479
00:30:45,504 --> 00:30:49,088
More things around

480
00:30:51,648 --> 00:30:52,160
Exactly

481
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:53,440
That sounds exactly like him

482
00:30:53,696 --> 00:30:54,208
Projecting

483
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,000
It is a psychic disease

484
00:30:56,512 --> 00:31:02,656
I've described the globalist live globalist mythology as a brain virus

485
00:31:03,168 --> 00:31:03,936
I believe that's okay

486
00:31:04,192 --> 00:31:08,544
Bizarre version of an understanding of

487
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:09,312
Evil

488
00:31:09,568 --> 00:31:15,456
Where is care of the big stuff in the small stuff goes away under plays

489
00:31:15,968 --> 00:31:16,992
Discount what he's

490
00:31:17,248 --> 00:31:18,272
Describing as a one

491
00:31:18,528 --> 00:31:19,552
Like I don't think it's a one

492
00:31:20,064 --> 00:31:20,832
I think alike

493
00:31:21,088 --> 00:31:22,112
How do you spell

494
00:31:22,368 --> 00:31:28,512
Might be a one or vandalism AsiaOne matica harassment of people in

495
00:31:28,768 --> 00:31:29,536
In order to

496
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:35,168
No no

497
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:36,704
Sure

498
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:39,264
Petty theft

499
00:31:39,776 --> 00:31:45,920
That's a whole different world different world

500
00:31:46,176 --> 00:31:50,272
We live in frankli under maritime law which is the only one that I accept

501
00:31:53,088 --> 00:31:53,600
Executed

502
00:31:54,368 --> 00:32:00,256
Okay well then they have your own Court

503
00:32:03,584 --> 00:32:06,912
So I don't know

504
00:32:07,168 --> 00:32:07,680
It's kind of

505
00:32:09,216 --> 00:32:10,240
Petty and stupid

506
00:32:10,496 --> 00:32:14,848
Don't really get you anywhere but it is complete

507
00:32:15,104 --> 00:32:15,872
It keeps you from

508
00:32:16,128 --> 00:32:19,200
Look if your idea is worried only about the

509
00:32:19,456 --> 00:32:19,968
The big crime

510
00:32:20,224 --> 00:32:21,248
Write only about that

511
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:22,272
Then

512
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:24,064
You wind up discounting

513
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:24,832
Everything else

514
00:32:29,952 --> 00:32:31,488
We got to deal with this over here

515
00:32:31,744 --> 00:32:33,536
And then any problem

516
00:32:34,048 --> 00:32:35,584
Well it's not raping and torturing

517
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:36,352
So let's

518
00:32:36,608 --> 00:32:37,376
Not worried

519
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:40,704
Fantasy 10

520
00:32:41,216 --> 00:32:41,984
Is not real

521
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:48,384
Do everything Alex complains about he thinks is a time and they have problems but then everything else is nothing

522
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:49,920
The other dangerous

523
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:50,688
Are you presenting

524
00:32:50,944 --> 00:32:53,504
This false world where people aren't working

525
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:58,624
Against Child exploitation investigating those sorts of things

526
00:32:59,136 --> 00:32:59,904
Human trafficking

527
00:33:04,512 --> 00:33:08,096
That's a conversation I'm willing to have as long as you go

528
00:33:08,352 --> 00:33:12,704
Also sexual harassment is a crime and it's a good thing that we're rooting these people

529
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:19,104
But Alex has never liked. On-air been like everyone to donate to these organizations are working against humans

530
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:19,872
Trafficking

531
00:33:27,552 --> 00:33:28,832
Play on the ground he just cares about it

532
00:33:29,088 --> 00:33:30,880
Exploding people's fears about them

533
00:33:31,136 --> 00:33:31,648
So

534
00:33:31,904 --> 00:33:32,416
Anyway

535
00:33:32,672 --> 00:33:37,280
Is Mexico if Alex gets into talking about the accent Hollywood

536
00:33:38,048 --> 00:33:39,584
Trump fat with Billy bush

537
00:33:43,168 --> 00:33:45,216
I feel like this has been covered

538
00:33:45,472 --> 00:33:46,240
More than enough

539
00:33:46,752 --> 00:33:49,056
Etui it has

540
00:33:49,312 --> 00:33:52,384
But it's been covered on all along all the angle

541
00:33:52,896 --> 00:33:58,272
Alex's take Elvis episode does Friday the 15th episode is really interesting cuz he takes a journey

542
00:33:58,784 --> 00:33:59,296
He starts

543
00:33:59,552 --> 00:34:02,368
Here and then after this clip I'll play you where he ends up

544
00:34:02,624 --> 00:34:03,648
He finds Colonel Kurtz

545
00:34:05,952 --> 00:34:06,464
Such a mess

546
00:34:07,744 --> 00:34:10,560
He contradicts himself within the course of an episode and it's

547
00:34:10,816 --> 00:34:11,584
Just bizarre

548
00:34:12,096 --> 00:34:12,608
He's so

549
00:34:12,864 --> 00:34:14,400
Desperate grasping at straws

550
00:34:14,656 --> 00:34:15,424
Lie about

551
00:34:15,936 --> 00:34:17,728
Even just basic reality

552
00:34:17,984 --> 00:34:20,544
To the point where like here's what he says at the beginning

553
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,592
And then I'll play you what he says

554
00:34:22,848 --> 00:34:23,360
At the end

555
00:34:24,128 --> 00:34:26,176
Citronal discharge coming out as it is

556
00:34:26,432 --> 00:34:27,456
They're just

557
00:34:27,712 --> 00:34:28,736
Cover it

558
00:34:29,504 --> 00:34:31,040
And still have the fake women

559
00:34:34,112 --> 00:34:35,136
He's talking about like

560
00:34:35,392 --> 00:34:41,536
We talk about this another episode his prediction that come January

561
00:34:41,792 --> 00:34:46,400
He's going to ignore the fact that

562
00:34:46,656 --> 00:34:48,704
Did Lisa Bloom is paying them all at night

563
00:34:53,312 --> 00:34:55,872
I mean this is all the stuff

564
00:34:58,176 --> 00:35:03,040
Patriot kontrolfreek

565
00:35:03,808 --> 00:35:05,600
He's going to run around raping women

566
00:35:06,112 --> 00:35:07,136
70

567
00:35:07,392 --> 00:35:09,440
1 years old before we find out about it

568
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:11,488
Yeah that's going to happen

569
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:15,328
Give me the people sign a bunch of non-disclosure agreement

570
00:35:15,584 --> 00:35:19,424
You settle courses cases out of court

571
00:35:24,544 --> 00:35:27,104
Punkpost no one and know him well Rodger Stone

572
00:35:27,616 --> 00:35:29,664
Coronavirus map

573
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:30,432
0

574
00:35:31,456 --> 00:35:31,968
0

575
00:35:32,992 --> 00:35:34,016
Absolute

576
00:35:40,416 --> 00:35:45,792
One recording behind the scenes

577
00:36:01,152 --> 00:36:06,016
And then I grabbed

578
00:36:08,576 --> 00:36:10,368
He grabbed them by the p****

579
00:36:13,696 --> 00:36:15,232
So long as you grab

580
00:36:29,568 --> 00:36:30,848
Refrigerator games

581
00:36:31,104 --> 00:36:36,224
Rehab

582
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,696
Indifferent

583
00:36:46,208 --> 00:36:49,280
I mostly kept that towards the end cuz I had that gross slurp noise

584
00:36:49,536 --> 00:36:51,328
Love him desperately trying to breathe

585
00:36:52,864 --> 00:36:59,008
So I mean if you go back and actually listen to the Access Hollywood tape

586
00:36:59,264 --> 00:37:00,032
Secretly recording

587
00:37:04,896 --> 00:37:08,480
Doesn't sound like that at all

588
00:37:08,736 --> 00:37:11,296
Even the gravel by the p**** part is

589
00:37:11,552 --> 00:37:12,320
Disgusting

590
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:14,880
But I I think

591
00:37:15,392 --> 00:37:16,160
I think the

592
00:37:16,416 --> 00:37:18,720
You could make an argument if you're Alex Jones

593
00:37:19,232 --> 00:37:20,256
What he's

594
00:37:20,768 --> 00:37:21,280
Saying is

595
00:37:22,304 --> 00:37:24,352
That I don't believe in locker room talk

596
00:37:24,608 --> 00:37:26,656
But I think he could make that argument

597
00:37:26,912 --> 00:37:28,448
Better about Zack quote

598
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:29,472
Zane about

599
00:37:29,728 --> 00:37:30,240
The quote

600
00:37:30,496 --> 00:37:31,520
From the same time

601
00:37:31,776 --> 00:37:32,800
Where Trump says

602
00:37:33,056 --> 00:37:35,616
I can't help myself sometimes I just start kissing

603
00:37:36,896 --> 00:37:38,432
That's because that implies

604
00:37:38,688 --> 00:37:40,224
Awareness of agency

605
00:37:40,736 --> 00:37:46,880
He knows that that is something that he does and he's talking about how he does it the grabbing by the p**** part

606
00:37:47,136 --> 00:37:47,904
Could just be like

607
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:48,672
The dirty talk

608
00:37:48,928 --> 00:37:49,696
Or something like that

609
00:37:49,952 --> 00:37:52,768
It's not but

610
00:37:54,048 --> 00:37:57,888
The reason that that to me

611
00:37:58,144 --> 00:37:58,656
No

612
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:01,728
I'm sorry Terminator up

613
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,592
He can't say that and why it's important

614
00:38:09,152 --> 00:38:11,200
Is because so many Republican voters

615
00:38:11,712 --> 00:38:13,248
Especially with his bulshit of like

616
00:38:13,504 --> 00:38:15,296
They hate Christians and all that stuff

617
00:38:15,808 --> 00:38:18,624
All of these Christians all of our lives

618
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:21,696
I've constantly like I'm not allowed to say p****

619
00:38:21,952 --> 00:38:22,720
Around my

620
00:38:23,232 --> 00:38:23,744
You know

621
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,024
I'm not allowed to say that

622
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:31,680
The public can you still vote

623
00:38:32,192 --> 00:38:38,336
No matter what you do f*** you well it's cuz it comes down to the radicalization of evangelicals with things that they

624
00:38:38,592 --> 00:38:39,104
Supposedly

625
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:43,712
Should care more about which is what Alex Jones is

626
00:38:43,968 --> 00:38:45,760
Make you fraid of demon

627
00:38:46,016 --> 00:38:47,040
That are all liberals

628
00:38:47,296 --> 00:38:51,648
Iams I all that s*** perfect man

629
00:38:53,952 --> 00:38:58,816
Talk about how crazy it is the women want to f*** in my bunch and you know that

630
00:38:59,072 --> 00:39:02,400
And the reality is

631
00:39:02,656 --> 00:39:06,496
As many times has of of this

632
00:39:07,264 --> 00:39:08,544
His listeners would be like

633
00:39:09,056 --> 00:39:10,848
I did vote for a ghost

634
00:39:11,104 --> 00:39:15,712
Well the bigger problem

635
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:16,992
Frequent

636
00:39:17,248 --> 00:39:17,760
Instances

637
00:39:19,552 --> 00:39:20,064
Literally

638
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,856
Just grab

639
00:39:26,976 --> 00:39:27,744
You know that

640
00:39:29,024 --> 00:39:31,584
He said that in what was it like 2015

641
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:37,984
The tape from Access Hollywood something like that

642
00:39:40,288 --> 00:39:41,056
Putting his hand up

643
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:42,080
People skirts

644
00:39:42,336 --> 00:39:44,640
S*** like that at Home Alone 2

645
00:39:44,896 --> 00:39:46,432
What is brutal

646
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:53,088
Come on man I like

647
00:39:53,344 --> 00:39:53,856
I don't like

648
00:39:54,112 --> 00:39:55,904
The point being

649
00:39:56,416 --> 00:39:58,208
Is because that exist

650
00:39:58,720 --> 00:39:59,744
I feel like it gives

651
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,048
Me. With witch

652
00:40:02,304 --> 00:40:03,328
Switch to invalidate

653
00:40:03,584 --> 00:40:04,352
Annie Christian

654
00:40:05,632 --> 00:40:07,424
Like anytime if my parents

655
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:10,240
Personality

656
00:40:10,496 --> 00:40:11,776
No I

657
00:40:12,288 --> 00:40:14,848
I mean like the ones are the ones who voted for him

658
00:40:15,104 --> 00:40:21,248
Consistently talk about the more the morality of homosexuality or whatever it is

659
00:40:21,504 --> 00:40:22,784
Is along those lines

660
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:28,416
All of that s*** is gone apocracy and into a complete

661
00:40:28,928 --> 00:40:34,560
You don't really believe anything's so f*** you under the bed in the demographics of the Alabama

662
00:40:34,816 --> 00:40:37,888
Not even when you look at the racial and gender breakdown

663
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:41,728
But you look at like Evangelical Christians voting for Roy Moore in

664
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:44,032
Drastic numbers

665
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:50,944
The only way to do that is to just assume that everyone's lying about everyone's the people who are lying are demonic

666
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:52,224
Runaway

667
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:52,992
And that clip

668
00:40:53,248 --> 00:40:55,808
Alex Jones is defensive Trump with that clip

669
00:40:56,064 --> 00:40:57,856
Together

670
00:40:58,368 --> 00:41:02,720
Of things he said

671
00:41:02,976 --> 00:41:09,120
He's just an old but good man whose like it's crazy that women want to f****** like this cuz I'm celebrity

672
00:41:09,376 --> 00:41:10,912
Tape where they edited

673
00:41:11,168 --> 00:41:15,776
And put it into that

674
00:41:16,032 --> 00:41:16,544
Oh

675
00:41:17,312 --> 00:41:19,104
Oh my

676
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:20,128
That

677
00:41:20,384 --> 00:41:23,456
Where else would you edit together Trump saying p****

678
00:41:23,712 --> 00:41:27,296
I think from this season of Celebrity Apprentice that had that Bret Michaels on it

679
00:41:27,552 --> 00:41:31,648
OK Google trying to not take responsibility for out there

680
00:41:31,904 --> 00:41:35,488
Yeah they're pretzels at work I never watch that show

681
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,280
So

682
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:43,168
I know that little pop-up businesses

683
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:48,544
Never watch that shows there's money in the banana

684
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:49,312
Anyway

685
00:41:50,592 --> 00:41:51,872
That was his defense in neck

686
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:54,431
Later on in the show this is one of the only times

687
00:41:54,687 --> 00:41:57,759
We're going to go out of chronological order in the episode

688
00:41:58,271 --> 00:41:58,783
Comparison

689
00:41:59,295 --> 00:42:00,831
Little bit later someone calls in

690
00:42:01,087 --> 00:42:03,647
And talks about how you can just make

691
00:42:03,903 --> 00:42:04,671
People say

692
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:05,951
Fake stuff

693
00:42:06,207 --> 00:42:08,255
With audio and video technology

694
00:42:08,511 --> 00:42:09,023
Okay

695
00:42:09,279 --> 00:42:10,047
Now that's

696
00:42:10,815 --> 00:42:12,607
Right

697
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:17,215
Considered that and what's the caller calls narrative

698
00:42:17,471 --> 00:42:21,055
Light bulb

699
00:42:21,311 --> 00:42:25,151
Someone just put it in a

700
00:42:26,943 --> 00:42:33,087
Perfect so

701
00:42:33,343 --> 00:42:36,671
So here is him putting the pieces together and also

702
00:42:37,183 --> 00:42:38,719
Doing a little bit of a rambling

703
00:42:38,975 --> 00:42:41,279
Intro music

704
00:42:42,303 --> 00:42:47,167
Your call cuz they're all still great and they bring

705
00:42:51,007 --> 00:42:55,359
We got to run from the globalist

706
00:42:55,615 --> 00:42:58,687
Oh do it

707
00:43:05,087 --> 00:43:09,439
Marching out of the Babylon into the stars in the future

708
00:43:09,695 --> 00:43:14,047
Rod run

709
00:43:14,303 --> 00:43:20,447
I would listen to that show

710
00:43:24,031 --> 00:43:25,823
And Ron

711
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:27,871
Run

712
00:43:45,535 --> 00:43:50,143
Coffee

713
00:43:51,935 --> 00:43:55,007
Now shut off one sentence other words

714
00:43:55,519 --> 00:43:57,055
Setbeat voiceprint

715
00:43:57,567 --> 00:44:00,127
So he I don't have

716
00:44:00,383 --> 00:44:03,967
Keep all the same cuz we plays the video of a guy demonstrating the technology

717
00:44:04,223 --> 00:44:10,367
From years ago couple years back

718
00:44:14,975 --> 00:44:17,023
And it just doesn't get to anything that proves his

719
00:44:17,535 --> 00:44:20,863
I assume he doesn't.

720
00:44:21,887 --> 00:44:26,239
Formed by there are ways you can

721
00:44:26,495 --> 00:44:27,007
Tell friend

722
00:44:27,775 --> 00:44:29,567
People can take the audio and see

723
00:44:29,823 --> 00:44:31,103
I know things have been edited

724
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:37,503
It is a really interesting future

725
00:44:37,759 --> 00:44:39,039
A version of it

726
00:44:39,551 --> 00:44:40,063
You might

727
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:45,951
You can pick something

728
00:44:46,207 --> 00:44:47,231
I didn't demonstration

729
00:44:47,487 --> 00:44:52,095
Sims 2 on YouTube of video technology

730
00:44:52,351 --> 00:44:55,423
You speak and it is able to actually alter the

731
00:44:55,679 --> 00:44:57,727
Mouth of the person who's talking

732
00:44:58,239 --> 00:45:00,543
Stuff is incredibly scary

733
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:09,503
A few years too early we're not there yet and also Billy Bush as I get

734
00:45:09,759 --> 00:45:12,831
Dunlop

735
00:45:13,087 --> 00:45:13,855
Analysis of it

736
00:45:15,391 --> 00:45:15,903
Why

737
00:45:16,671 --> 00:45:22,559
We all know he said

738
00:45:23,583 --> 00:45:28,959
Easiest mystery to solve ever ever we don't need to go into voice

739
00:45:29,215 --> 00:45:33,311
The only thing that I care to bring up and talk about is

740
00:45:33,567 --> 00:45:39,455
Is the idea that Alex had The Narrative of a caller calls in technology

741
00:45:39,711 --> 00:45:41,247
Alex fails

742
00:45:41,503 --> 00:45:42,783
Play a clip

743
00:45:43,295 --> 00:45:45,599
Exploring the technology and I need like

744
00:45:47,135 --> 00:45:47,647
What

745
00:45:48,415 --> 00:45:49,439
What do you think of

746
00:45:49,695 --> 00:45:50,207
An old

747
00:45:54,559 --> 00:45:55,071
I from Up

748
00:45:55,327 --> 00:45:56,351
I don't know alright

749
00:45:57,119 --> 00:45:58,911

752
00:46:05,823 --> 00:46:11,967
Earlier in the week Alex Jones

753
00:46:12,223 --> 00:46:13,503
Want to fuc cars

754
00:46:16,575 --> 00:46:17,599
I did not see that coming

755
00:46:19,391 --> 00:46:20,415
It took me by surprise

756
00:46:20,671 --> 00:46:23,743
He also relates to homosexuality

757
00:46:27,839 --> 00:46:32,191
Mechanophilia

758
00:46:32,447 --> 00:46:33,983
Subset of people who are

759
00:46:34,239 --> 00:46:38,079
Sexually attracted to machines

760
00:46:38,335 --> 00:46:44,479
I married the Eiffel Tower

761
00:46:44,735 --> 00:46:46,271
Don't f****** get in my in anybody

762
00:46:46,527 --> 00:46:48,063
Harmless

763
00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:50,111
To a certain extent

764
00:46:50,367 --> 00:46:52,159
Bar in 2000's

765
00:46:52,415 --> 00:46:58,559
If you have three questions

766
00:46:58,815 --> 00:46:59,839
To get across

767
00:47:00,095 --> 00:47:00,863
That I find offensive

768
00:47:01,631 --> 00:47:02,143
2 questions

769
00:47:03,679 --> 00:47:09,823
There was a video that went viral

770
00:47:10,335 --> 00:47:12,127
The story about a guy who claimed

771
00:47:12,383 --> 00:47:15,455
Go to England to Calamity that sex with 1000 cars

772
00:47:17,759 --> 00:47:23,903
Almost 10 years ago now every time he's

773
00:47:25,695 --> 00:47:27,999
There was a

774
00:47:28,255 --> 00:47:32,095
Popular about 10 years ago as a point of conversation

775
00:47:32,351 --> 00:47:33,119
I got back

776
00:47:33,375 --> 00:47:34,655
Sure so I'll

777
00:47:36,703 --> 00:47:37,471
When Alex

778
00:47:37,727 --> 00:47:38,495
Disgusting

779
00:47:39,263 --> 00:47:41,823
He was discussing it at in terms of like

780
00:47:43,103 --> 00:47:45,663
He Compares it to homosexuality

781
00:47:46,431 --> 00:47:49,759
Inasmuch as like why do I got to respect all this stuff

782
00:47:50,015 --> 00:47:51,039
All your letters

783
00:47:51,551 --> 00:47:54,367
And stuff like all your lgbtq f****** cars

784
00:47:56,415 --> 00:47:58,719
What he's doing is he's taking

785
00:47:58,975 --> 00:47:59,487
Like soda

786
00:47:59,999 --> 00:48:00,511
Very

787
00:48:01,023 --> 00:48:01,535
Basic

788
00:48:01,791 --> 00:48:04,095
Sexual identity

789
00:48:04,607 --> 00:48:10,751
Bring them into paraphilia what's next

790
00:48:11,007 --> 00:48:12,543
Exactly exactly

791
00:48:13,055 --> 00:48:13,567
Exactly

792
00:48:14,591 --> 00:48:15,103
He

793
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:15,871
Did this

794
00:48:18,687 --> 00:48:20,223
Weird

795
00:48:21,247 --> 00:48:21,759
Too f****** anime

796
00:48:22,527 --> 00:48:23,039
I feel like yeah

797
00:48:23,807 --> 00:48:26,367
Well inasmuch as ones alive yes

798
00:48:26,623 --> 00:48:29,183
I don't know just like from a

799
00:48:29,439 --> 00:48:35,583
Bass Lake mechanic Stampy you're splitting hairs I don't want to go down this road

800
00:48:36,863 --> 00:48:42,239
The point is is it like

801
00:48:42,495 --> 00:48:44,543
Rodger Stone

802
00:48:45,311 --> 00:48:49,919
Stone of Rodger Stone

803
00:48:50,175 --> 00:48:50,687
Yeah it is

804
00:48:50,943 --> 00:48:51,455
So

805
00:48:52,479 --> 00:48:53,759
Alex earlier in the week

806
00:48:54,271 --> 00:48:58,623
It wasn't that he was 121 comparing being gay with f****** cars

807
00:48:58,879 --> 00:49:05,023
But in his rank he was so unclear about what he was talking about and what is complaining about

808
00:49:05,279 --> 00:49:06,815
The people on like Media Matters

809
00:49:08,351 --> 00:49:12,191
Told that it was like a homophobic rant in cars

810
00:49:12,447 --> 00:49:15,263
And to be fair to them they were wrong

811
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:19,615
Yeah there was there was homophobia in it but he wasn't

812
00:49:20,127 --> 00:49:21,407
Spain gay people f***

813
00:49:21,663 --> 00:49:23,199
Cars he wasn't saying that

814
00:49:23,455 --> 00:49:24,991
And if they works

815
00:49:25,247 --> 00:49:27,039
But Alex think that's what he was

816
00:49:27,551 --> 00:49:29,087
They were saying he was saying

817
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:30,623
So on Friday

818
00:49:30,879 --> 00:49:33,695
He rants about the reaction to the rant

819
00:49:34,207 --> 00:49:35,743
In a very weird way

820
00:49:37,279 --> 00:49:37,791
Troubling

821
00:49:38,047 --> 00:49:42,399
This is very troubling

822
00:49:42,911 --> 00:49:43,423
Like

823
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:46,751
A long time ago

824
00:49:47,775 --> 00:49:50,335
I would have are far away

825
00:49:50,847 --> 00:49:51,359
Great movie

826
00:49:51,615 --> 00:49:52,127
Creep movie

827
00:49:54,175 --> 00:49:54,687
What

828
00:49:54,943 --> 00:49:55,455
Brexit

829
00:49:55,711 --> 00:50:01,855
Craziest f****** thing of course he's mad that he people think that he said that he thinks that he

830
00:50:03,647 --> 00:50:09,791
He's misrepresenting coverage of him being super unclear by what he's talking about

831
00:50:10,047 --> 00:50:10,815
Exactly

832
00:50:11,071 --> 00:50:11,583
It's just this

833
00:50:12,095 --> 00:50:12,607
It's like I was

834
00:50:12,863 --> 00:50:15,935
Sea of fog

835
00:50:16,191 --> 00:50:17,215
Get out of it

836
00:50:17,471 --> 00:50:20,543
Here is this dogshit wrapped and goes on on Friday

837
00:50:21,567 --> 00:50:25,407
Oh you're going to

838
00:50:41,279 --> 00:50:44,095
Surgeries in Europe

839
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:48,959
Where they remove bleach in your eye

840
00:50:49,215 --> 00:50:52,287
I tried to find you like not a surgery

841
00:50:57,919 --> 00:50:59,711
But he saying there's hundreds

842
00:50:59,967 --> 00:51:01,247
In all of Europe

843
00:51:02,527 --> 00:51:07,135
I don't know maybe there's hundreds of cases people pouring in their own eyes

844
00:51:12,511 --> 00:51:15,327
Statistically sighting I miss my road I don't want to go.

845
00:51:27,871 --> 00:51:30,175
Applying to balls

846
00:51:38,111 --> 00:51:39,647
All he's going off of

847
00:51:39,903 --> 00:51:41,951
Is a tiny clip that he has

848
00:51:42,207 --> 00:51:48,351
From a British show that's like My Strange Addiction whatever this

849
00:51:48,607 --> 00:51:50,399
Stuff like that

850
00:51:50,655 --> 00:51:52,703
Human-interest sort of shows

851
00:51:52,959 --> 00:51:56,287
He's just misrepresenting like a years old 3 minutes left

852
00:51:56,543 --> 00:52:02,687
Flickr show that's like a look at it look at how we're doing

853
00:52:02,943 --> 00:52:05,759
Version and not racist version of like humans

854
00:52:06,015 --> 00:52:08,831
Are We Now do on till

855
00:52:09,087 --> 00:52:09,855
I like

856
00:52:10,111 --> 00:52:14,975
Just got this image of a guy out of his front lawn

857
00:52:15,231 --> 00:52:19,839
Just sitting out on his front lawn just poured bleach into his eye labors of water

858
00:52:20,095 --> 00:52:20,607
That's f******

859
00:52:22,911 --> 00:52:25,471
I really approve of this proud of you

860
00:52:25,983 --> 00:52:26,495
Bully

861
00:52:40,575 --> 00:52:43,391
Okay

862
00:52:46,207 --> 00:52:49,791
I don't think he believes that

863
00:52:53,887 --> 00:52:54,911
A robot

864
00:53:12,575 --> 00:53:16,927
Isabel

865
00:53:18,975 --> 00:53:19,999
This is how they do it

866
00:53:42,015 --> 00:53:46,111
Marco's mother's Brandon John I buy alternative

867
00:53:46,623 --> 00:53:47,391
Seriously

868
00:53:52,255 --> 00:53:54,559
The Articles to videos the report

869
00:54:09,151 --> 00:54:10,175
Garfunkel

870
00:54:10,431 --> 00:54:14,015
Infowarsstore.com we need funding

871
00:54:14,527 --> 00:54:15,039
Yeah

872
00:54:15,295 --> 00:54:16,575
So I mean

873
00:54:16,831 --> 00:54:19,903
You know it like you can smell it coming from a mile away

874
00:54:21,183 --> 00:54:23,487
We're going to race across Europe

875
00:54:23,743 --> 00:54:24,255
And then

876
00:54:26,047 --> 00:54:27,839
I didn't

877
00:54:28,095 --> 00:54:29,375
Like a

878
00:54:29,887 --> 00:54:31,679
People explorers and f****** animals

879
00:54:31,935 --> 00:54:35,263
Stroud on the you know there's no one around

880
00:54:35,775 --> 00:54:38,079
Shitbreak I don't

881
00:54:38,335 --> 00:54:38,847
Look

882
00:54:39,615 --> 00:54:45,759
Pictures of all human behavior it's just all pathetic like

883
00:54:47,039 --> 00:54:51,135
Because it can't he's he's yelling about like I don't need to know the abbreviations

884
00:54:51,391 --> 00:54:52,927
I don't need to know the letters

885
00:54:53,183 --> 00:54:54,975
Unlike the letters are not talking about people

886
00:54:58,303 --> 00:54:59,839
We're talking about people who are

887
00:55:00,607 --> 00:55:01,375
You know very

888
00:55:01,631 --> 00:55:02,655
Legitimate

889
00:55:03,167 --> 00:55:05,727
Here's a conversation maybe we should have

890
00:55:05,983 --> 00:55:10,079
People who f*** cars are less oppressed than gay people

891
00:55:10,335 --> 00:55:12,895
To some extent yeah how do you consider that Alex

892
00:55:13,151 --> 00:55:15,967
In the acronym

893
00:55:16,223 --> 00:55:17,759
Because they're fine

894
00:55:18,015 --> 00:55:21,343
They don't need an advocacy group

895
00:55:21,599 --> 00:55:22,623
Everybody's more like

896
00:55:24,671 --> 00:55:27,999
Don't do that in public

897
00:55:28,255 --> 00:55:32,351
You see a guy like started robbing a car in a garage

898
00:55:34,911 --> 00:55:36,191
It's troubling

899
00:55:36,959 --> 00:55:38,239
Like

900
00:55:38,495 --> 00:55:39,775
If you've ever met a card

901
00:55:40,031 --> 00:55:41,823
Dude there's such an autoerotic

902
00:55:42,847 --> 00:55:43,871
Auto

903
00:55:44,127 --> 00:55:48,223
Auto-erotic

904
00:55:48,991 --> 00:55:52,575
Mechanophilia

905
00:55:53,855 --> 00:55:57,951
Do you allow those guys if you left them alone with their cars for too long

906
00:55:58,719 --> 00:55:59,999
On the car

907
00:56:02,303 --> 00:56:03,839
Quite frankly I don't care

908
00:56:04,095 --> 00:56:05,119
I really don't care

909
00:56:06,143 --> 00:56:08,191
Have I got a YouTube video for live

910
00:56:08,703 --> 00:56:09,727
Live your life

911
00:56:10,751 --> 00:56:16,383
That's what I say that's my motto you know what I've seen people get married

912
00:56:16,895 --> 00:56:20,479
There are

913
00:56:22,271 --> 00:56:24,319
I don't know if the state recognizes

914
00:56:24,575 --> 00:56:27,647
Is the marriage between man in Colorado

915
00:56:27,903 --> 00:56:30,975
What's the car

916
00:56:33,023 --> 00:56:33,535
Look

917
00:56:34,047 --> 00:56:37,375
But I have a lot of fun and make jokes and stuff but like

918
00:56:40,191 --> 00:56:41,983
Is doing is he's complaining

919
00:56:42,495 --> 00:56:43,519
Sexual identity

920
00:56:43,775 --> 00:56:44,799
Sexual orientation

921
00:56:45,055 --> 00:56:45,567
With

922
00:56:45,823 --> 00:56:46,335
These

923
00:56:47,615 --> 00:56:51,455
I mean I don't I don't think they're wrong or bad but they are

924
00:56:51,711 --> 00:56:52,223
Certainly

925
00:56:52,479 --> 00:56:53,759
Very anomalous

926
00:56:54,015 --> 00:56:55,551
Yeah and they fall under the heading

927
00:56:55,807 --> 00:56:59,135
Paraphilia

928
00:56:59,391 --> 00:57:00,671
Sexual fetishes

929
00:57:00,927 --> 00:57:01,439
Might be.

930
00:57:01,695 --> 00:57:02,719
Destructive

931
00:57:03,231 --> 00:57:04,511
It's not necessarily

932
00:57:04,767 --> 00:57:07,839
Destructive but it's certainly way outside the realm

933
00:57:08,095 --> 00:57:14,239
Abnormal human behavior

934
00:57:14,495 --> 00:57:15,007
TLC

935
00:57:15,263 --> 00:57:17,311
It's usually TLC where I live

936
00:57:17,823 --> 00:57:19,615
So he can't leave his house

937
00:57:20,639 --> 00:57:21,663
What it is

938
00:57:21,919 --> 00:57:22,687
Televised free

939
00:57:23,199 --> 00:57:23,711
More less

940
00:57:23,967 --> 00:57:28,831
And there's the reason that there's a real because

941
00:57:29,087 --> 00:57:31,391
Images of percentages of that population are

942
00:57:31,647 --> 00:57:32,927
Nothing ridiculous

943
00:57:34,719 --> 00:57:35,487
It's just

944
00:57:36,767 --> 00:57:37,791
Annabelle inability

945
00:57:38,047 --> 00:57:38,815
To understand

946
00:57:39,071 --> 00:57:39,583
People are saying

947
00:57:40,095 --> 00:57:41,375
Is inability to understand

948
00:57:41,631 --> 00:57:42,911
Criticism or unwillingness

949
00:57:44,703 --> 00:57:46,239
Is unwillingness to

950
00:57:47,007 --> 00:57:49,823
Or it's a testament to the strength of his ability

951
00:57:50,079 --> 00:57:52,127
To ignore and misunderstand

952
00:57:52,639 --> 00:57:53,663
Unwillingness

953
00:57:53,919 --> 00:57:54,431
To disconnect

954
00:57:54,687 --> 00:57:56,223
The idea of

955
00:57:56,735 --> 00:57:59,295
Homosexuality transgender

956
00:57:59,551 --> 00:58:00,319
Issues with

957
00:58:01,087 --> 00:58:03,647
I f***** my car he thinks that they're all free

958
00:58:04,159 --> 00:58:07,743
I'm so jumpy lumps them all into one that's

959
00:58:12,095 --> 00:58:16,191
Is still not a defensible position because your position is

960
00:58:16,447 --> 00:58:17,983
Freak don't have rights

961
00:58:24,895 --> 00:58:27,455
You believe that you need to understand

962
00:58:27,711 --> 00:58:28,735
Still wrong

963
00:58:29,247 --> 00:58:31,039
That's still the most wrong

964
00:58:32,575 --> 00:58:36,927
Like if your defense is being gay is exactly like f****** a car

965
00:58:37,183 --> 00:58:40,255
And so you shouldn't have rights the answer to that

966
00:58:40,767 --> 00:58:41,791
Are you a human being

967
00:58:42,559 --> 00:58:43,327
So you get

968
00:58:43,839 --> 00:58:47,167
So you have those right you all right that's how human human rights

969
00:58:48,447 --> 00:58:49,727
We have

970
00:58:49,983 --> 00:58:52,031
Fair enough let's move on

971
00:58:52,287 --> 00:58:53,567
You better road to go down here

972
00:58:53,823 --> 00:58:56,639
Send a text to Alex Jones has brought in Rodger Stone

973
00:58:57,151 --> 00:58:59,199
Expert witness Rodger Stone

974
00:59:03,295 --> 00:59:04,063
Already felon

975
00:59:04,319 --> 00:59:08,159
Rogers the two of them have a conversation about

976
00:59:11,231 --> 00:59:17,375
Watch that press conference I rolled it back and watched it three times when they brought out the so-called

977
00:59:17,631 --> 00:59:18,143
Call victim

978
00:59:18,655 --> 00:59:21,471
Their Force

979
00:59:31,455 --> 00:59:34,783
4 years

980
00:59:35,039 --> 00:59:39,135
I mean

981
00:59:42,719 --> 00:59:48,863
Yeah I know these women were his typing when he was single he dated supermodel and virtually only two

982
00:59:49,119 --> 00:59:52,703
Supermodel

983
00:59:53,727 --> 00:59:55,775
Standards myself

984
00:59:57,311 --> 00:59:58,847
This is this is sad

985
00:59:59,359 --> 01:00:02,687
This is sad the conversation

986
01:00:04,735 --> 01:00:07,039
About these women being too ugly for Trump baby

987
01:00:08,063 --> 01:00:10,367
That's a major selling point of his argument now

988
01:00:11,135 --> 01:00:15,743
Lisa Bloom is paying them all and they're too f****** ugly they look like aliens or praying mantis

989
01:00:18,047 --> 01:00:19,071
It's not good

990
01:00:19,327 --> 01:00:23,167
No and it also is reinforcing the exact

991
01:00:23,423 --> 01:00:26,495
World view that the people who are coming out with

992
01:00:26,751 --> 01:00:27,519
Sexual assault

993
01:00:32,639 --> 01:00:34,431
Allowing this to continue

994
01:00:34,687 --> 01:00:35,199
So that's great

995
01:00:35,967 --> 01:00:36,991
Rodger Stone

996
01:00:37,759 --> 01:00:40,831
He talks about how he's being sued that Amicus

997
01:00:41,343 --> 01:00:45,183
You talk about that a little bit and he's like isn't it crazy they won't let me

998
01:00:45,439 --> 01:00:47,487
They won't let me Grill Clapper

999
01:00:47,743 --> 01:00:51,839
They won't let me he won't he won't come into court and let me cross-examine Emily

1000
01:00:52,607 --> 01:00:53,631
Roblox

1001
01:00:55,167 --> 01:00:56,703
Is he

1002
01:00:57,983 --> 01:01:02,079
Write this is part of the antifreeze is part of a lawsuit

1003
01:01:02,335 --> 01:01:04,383
Against Trump and Rodger Stone

1004
01:01:04,639 --> 01:01:05,663
Because of the WikiLeaks

1005
01:01:06,431 --> 01:01:09,759
Right there is an issue where number of people's personal identities

1006
01:01:10,783 --> 01:01:13,087
Their personal information got leaked

1007
01:01:13,599 --> 01:01:15,391
Into the public because of those

1008
01:01:15,647 --> 01:01:16,671
WikiLeaks

1009
01:01:17,183 --> 01:01:19,743
Disclosure

1010
01:01:21,279 --> 01:01:21,791
Campaign

1011
01:01:22,047 --> 01:01:23,071
And Rodger stone for there

1012
01:01:23,327 --> 01:01:24,095
Complicity in

1013
01:01:24,351 --> 01:01:25,631
The promotion of those leaks

1014
01:01:26,399 --> 01:01:32,031
And the possible being involved with

1015
01:01:33,311 --> 01:01:36,639
Yeah they totally because Breeze is establishing to Atherton

1016
01:01:36,895 --> 01:01:39,967
Extent that

1017
01:01:40,735 --> 01:01:41,247
And

1018
01:01:41,503 --> 01:01:44,319
That Russian intelligence has a history going back

1019
01:01:44,831 --> 01:01:45,599
Nylon

1020
01:01:45,855 --> 01:01:49,695
Cold war-era especially since 2001

1021
01:01:49,951 --> 01:01:50,975
Came into power

1022
01:01:51,231 --> 01:01:53,279
Using local people to

1023
01:01:53,535 --> 01:01:56,095
Disseminate information

1024
01:01:56,351 --> 01:01:57,375
There

1025
01:01:57,887 --> 01:01:59,935
Turtle Point man in countries

1026
01:02:00,191 --> 01:02:00,959
Where is

1027
01:02:01,215 --> 01:02:05,311
Ratso Epi read the entire briefing

1028
01:02:05,823 --> 01:02:06,335
Yeah they did

1029
01:02:06,591 --> 01:02:07,359
They did that

1030
01:02:07,871 --> 01:02:08,383
And

1031
01:02:08,639 --> 01:02:12,479
We can't tell you that Rodger stone is responsible for a lot of this stuff

1032
01:02:12,735 --> 01:02:13,247
4 reasons

1033
01:02:14,271 --> 01:02:15,039
So

1034
01:02:16,063 --> 01:02:17,599
He talked about that and he just misses it

1035
01:02:17,855 --> 01:02:19,135
Anna plays the victim in

1036
01:02:19,391 --> 01:02:21,183
Like a sad little snowflake

1037
01:02:22,463 --> 01:02:22,975
He says one

1038
01:02:23,999 --> 01:02:24,767
About one of the women

1039
01:02:25,279 --> 01:02:25,791
Accusing Donald

1040
01:02:26,303 --> 01:02:27,071
I don't want to know what

1041
01:02:27,583 --> 01:02:28,607
Actually really great

1042
01:02:29,375 --> 01:02:30,911
I don't understand

1043
01:02:31,167 --> 01:02:34,239
What you mean by that it's great because it's so weak

1044
01:02:34,495 --> 01:02:36,543
But it also points the finger back at him

1045
01:02:37,823 --> 01:02:40,895
In a way that he probably should be much more careful with his words

1046
01:02:42,175 --> 01:02:42,687
Okay

1047
01:02:43,967 --> 01:02:50,111
I think you have to hold some of the ammunition back I am chasing a very active story

1048
01:02:50,367 --> 01:02:52,415
One of the women who suck user

1049
01:02:52,671 --> 01:02:55,487
Who was on The Apprentice

1050
01:02:58,303 --> 01:03:01,631
Repeatedly in her application to even get on the show

1051
01:03:07,775 --> 01:03:09,055
If you lie about one thing

1052
01:03:09,567 --> 01:03:10,335
You lie about every

1053
01:03:11,359 --> 01:03:12,895
Rodger Stones belief

1054
01:03:13,151 --> 01:03:14,687
About his career

1055
01:03:14,943 --> 01:03:16,735
I have bad news about Alex's career

1056
01:03:16,991 --> 01:03:20,063
I've bad news if you hold anyone to that standard

1057
01:03:20,319 --> 01:03:22,623
Lying on an application to a f****** reality show

1058
01:03:22,879 --> 01:03:26,975
Who gives a s***

1059
01:03:29,791 --> 01:03:30,559
When I was in college

1060
01:03:30,815 --> 01:03:31,839
Of course I did

1061
01:03:38,495 --> 01:03:42,079
You were like

1062
01:03:42,591 --> 01:03:48,479
You got to know a lot about Alex Jones to be on the show and then we've sort of pivoted through this no

1063
01:03:48,735 --> 01:03:50,783
This new format where you know nothing about it

1064
01:03:51,039 --> 01:03:52,319
Well I was the most qualified

1065
01:03:52,575 --> 01:03:53,087
Certainly

1066
01:03:53,343 --> 01:03:54,111
Certainly

1067
01:03:54,367 --> 01:03:57,695
But I am going to sue you for lying about

1068
01:03:58,207 --> 01:04:01,023
I just think it's really fascinating William documented Liars

1069
01:04:02,559 --> 01:04:03,327
Get together

1070
01:04:03,839 --> 01:04:05,631
And complain about someone else lying

1071
01:04:05,887 --> 01:04:06,911
An Oculus

1072
01:04:07,423 --> 01:04:11,007
And then say that it indicates that everything they do is not credible

1073
01:04:11,263 --> 01:04:12,287
Unjust

1074
01:04:12,543 --> 01:04:13,311
For people to lie about

1075
01:04:17,407 --> 01:04:19,711
But they're doing

1076
01:04:20,223 --> 01:04:20,991
She's lying about him

1077
01:04:21,247 --> 01:04:22,271
It's about my boy

1078
01:04:23,551 --> 01:04:27,391
Yeah you do that stated that's a really interesting question

1079
01:04:27,903 --> 01:04:34,047
No it's not how much.

1080
01:04:41,983 --> 01:04:43,263
These guys

1081
01:04:48,639 --> 01:04:51,455
Associate themselves with his identity

1082
01:04:51,711 --> 01:04:55,551
And I think there's different reasons for it just might be a little bit out there

1083
01:04:55,807 --> 01:04:57,599
Speculative but I believe that the reason

1084
01:04:57,855 --> 01:05:00,927
For it

1085
01:05:01,439 --> 01:05:02,207
Well that's part of it

1086
01:05:02,463 --> 01:05:03,743
I think it's hierarchical to

1087
01:05:03,999 --> 01:05:06,303
Certain extent like I believe that Rodger Stone

1088
01:05:06,559 --> 01:05:07,839
Is defensive of trump

1089
01:05:08,095 --> 01:05:08,863
At this point

1090
01:05:09,119 --> 01:05:09,631
For safety

1091
01:05:09,887 --> 01:05:13,727
Because attacks on Trump or attack on him he understand

1092
01:05:14,239 --> 01:05:18,591
We get this layer up I'm under there that sort of thing

1093
01:05:20,127 --> 01:05:21,919
I don't know Alex is at

1094
01:05:22,175 --> 01:05:23,711
Delta Epsilon

1095
01:05:24,223 --> 01:05:26,015
He's down there cuz

1096
01:05:26,271 --> 01:05:28,831
His fear and identification

1097
01:05:29,855 --> 01:05:30,367
Alphabet

1098
01:05:31,647 --> 01:05:32,927
Alpha Beta

1099
01:05:33,183 --> 01:05:35,999
Delta Lambda Zeta

1100
01:05:36,255 --> 01:05:41,119
Iota Omicron Salon Omega

1101
01:05:43,167 --> 01:05:48,799
Epsilon the second time around up here

1102
01:05:50,847 --> 01:05:53,151
Send the name of the bad guy in the Megaman

1103
01:05:53,407 --> 01:05:54,431
Pipe C

1104
01:05:54,943 --> 01:05:57,247
Are two different letters row

1105
01:05:57,503 --> 01:06:00,575
I should have done this in order to

1106
01:06:00,831 --> 01:06:02,367
Numu

1107
01:06:03,903 --> 01:06:05,183
So I can run out anyway

1108
01:06:05,439 --> 01:06:06,207
Happy Jew

1109
01:06:08,767 --> 01:06:12,095
The rallying cry numu happy to

1110
01:06:12,351 --> 01:06:15,167
But I can't I think Alex's

1111
01:06:15,423 --> 01:06:15,935
Does

1112
01:06:16,447 --> 01:06:20,799
Certain a jerk need to defend Trump is based on things that Rodger has told him

1113
01:06:21,055 --> 01:06:21,823
But there's a filter

1114
01:06:22,335 --> 01:06:25,663
Like Rodger isn't telling him if Trump goes down we're all going to prison

1115
01:06:26,175 --> 01:06:29,759
Spinning to Alex's well

1116
01:06:30,015 --> 01:06:31,551
He is our last defense against the

1117
01:06:31,807 --> 01:06:33,087
Globalist have you

1118
01:06:33,343 --> 01:06:34,879
Beating into Alex's narrative

1119
01:06:35,903 --> 01:06:36,415
Is

1120
01:06:36,671 --> 01:06:37,695
Conscious he knows

1121
01:06:37,951 --> 01:06:39,231
Did if Trump goes down he's in

1122
01:06:39,487 --> 01:06:41,791
Very serious legal trouble

1123
01:06:42,559 --> 01:06:44,095
Consciously and overtly

1124
01:06:44,351 --> 01:06:45,119
It's more

1125
01:06:45,887 --> 01:06:47,679
I need my mission to become

1126
01:06:47,935 --> 01:06:53,567
Completed and Trump will help complete that mission both very

1127
01:06:53,823 --> 01:06:57,407
Personally involved in stopping

1128
01:06:59,711 --> 01:07:00,735
To me that makes sense

1129
01:07:01,247 --> 01:07:02,271
The weird part

1130
01:07:02,527 --> 01:07:03,295
Is that

1131
01:07:04,575 --> 01:07:06,111
Ticket is Perez a text on

1132
01:07:06,367 --> 01:07:06,879
That

1133
01:07:07,647 --> 01:07:08,159
Like

1134
01:07:09,439 --> 01:07:13,791
I'm fine if you're Rodger Stone and you're saying well in attack on Trump is an attack on my

1135
01:07:15,071 --> 01:07:16,863
What seems to be the case though is

1136
01:07:17,119 --> 01:07:18,143
If it's an attack on Trump

1137
01:07:18,399 --> 01:07:19,935
It's an attack on me personal

1138
01:07:20,191 --> 01:07:20,959
Well that's the brand

1139
01:07:21,471 --> 01:07:23,007
That's a branding Trump is Oliver

1140
01:07:23,775 --> 01:07:24,287
Compass

1141
01:07:25,311 --> 01:07:28,383
Esbl figurehead of our

1142
01:07:31,199 --> 01:07:32,991
I all this stuff of course

1143
01:07:36,063 --> 01:07:42,207
Bomber that's a long time pushing

1144
01:07:42,463 --> 01:07:43,487
Flex glue

1145
01:07:43,743 --> 01:07:45,023
Alex is mad about just

1146
01:07:45,279 --> 01:07:45,791
Results

1147
01:07:46,303 --> 01:07:47,839
But Amazon who wouldn't be

1148
01:07:48,095 --> 01:07:50,143
Apparently

1149
01:07:50,399 --> 01:07:54,751
He's trying to shut down Alex Jones

1150
01:07:55,007 --> 01:07:56,543
So he's complaining about that

1151
01:07:57,823 --> 01:07:58,591
2 territory

1152
01:07:58,847 --> 01:07:59,615
You probably should

1153
01:08:02,175 --> 01:08:04,223
They're actively trying to get us shutdown

1154
01:08:04,735 --> 01:08:09,087
Jerry's kids shirt

1155
01:08:11,647 --> 01:08:13,695
Shut up

1156
01:08:19,327 --> 01:08:20,607
They're not his box

1157
01:08:22,399 --> 01:08:24,959
Amazon

1158
01:08:25,215 --> 01:08:28,543
Because then they put off Chinese knockoffs on there

1159
01:08:28,799 --> 01:08:29,823
Alarm products

1160
01:08:30,591 --> 01:08:33,151
Undercut so we have to be on Amazon

1161
01:08:33,663 --> 01:08:38,015
To be able to declare that we

1162
01:08:38,271 --> 01:08:40,319
Amazon

1163
01:08:40,575 --> 01:08:41,599
It's all strategic

1164
01:08:47,231 --> 01:08:49,535
She's on it

1165
01:08:50,559 --> 01:08:51,327
Exactly

1166
01:08:51,583 --> 01:08:55,423
Just like Trump has to do something you got to be in the swamp

1167
01:08:55,935 --> 01:09:00,031
We had hundreds of resellers most of it's fake

1168
01:09:00,543 --> 01:09:02,335
Problem

1169
01:09:12,575 --> 01:09:17,695
To shut down the Amazon to shut down

1170
01:09:18,207 --> 01:09:20,767
Good Lord what is a gentleman

1171
01:09:24,095 --> 01:09:27,679
We're in a war I'm on the deck of a ship they are shooting Rush

1172
01:09:43,551 --> 01:09:47,135
Christmas every year houses funded the next year decided to go stay the same

1173
01:09:47,391 --> 01:09:51,231
Pressure point

1174
01:09:51,999 --> 01:09:55,583
Been expanding for 22 years

1175
01:09:55,839 --> 01:09:59,423
Someone has I believe I believe it's based on the reality that we sing

1176
01:09:59,679 --> 01:10:05,055
In front of a euro

1177
01:10:05,311 --> 01:10:05,823
Oh man

1178
01:10:07,615 --> 01:10:12,479
The thing that I want to talk about it I've heard corsi break

1179
01:10:14,015 --> 01:10:18,111
Heart Hospital

1180
01:10:18,367 --> 01:10:22,463
They don't go viral but they're also real right

1181
01:10:22,719 --> 01:10:26,303
And you can't listen true know there is a problem with that

1182
01:10:26,559 --> 01:10:27,583
Sure there's a couple

1183
01:10:27,839 --> 01:10:29,887
Interesting

1184
01:10:30,399 --> 01:10:33,727
If you're positive I like crazy

1185
01:10:33,983 --> 01:10:39,615
I'm so the other thing I don't talk about there is that what he's complaining about is this idea that I have to be on Amazon

1186
01:10:39,871 --> 01:10:40,639
Cuz if I'm not

1187
01:10:40,895 --> 01:10:43,711
Then there'll be resellers who pop up on Amazon

1188
01:10:43,967 --> 01:10:46,527
But don't follow the rules of reselling my stuff

1189
01:10:46,783 --> 01:10:51,903
I don't really like but it's also ironic considering

1190
01:10:52,159 --> 01:10:52,671
He started

1191
01:10:52,927 --> 01:10:57,279
Fortified supply.com in order to get around reselling agreements

1192
01:10:57,535 --> 01:11:00,095
With the people that he resells

1193
01:11:00,351 --> 01:11:06,495
We get the entire thing we talked about like a week ago week cuz I started the traffic there and around

1194
01:11:06,751 --> 01:11:09,055
Prosperity

1195
01:11:09,311 --> 01:11:12,383
The same thing to keep suppliers with his stuff

1196
01:11:13,151 --> 01:11:14,687
Oh yeah but it's bad what happened

1197
01:11:14,943 --> 01:11:15,455
To him

1198
01:11:15,711 --> 01:11:19,295
He doesn't care about those other people

1199
01:11:19,807 --> 01:11:21,087
It's so pathetic

1200
01:11:21,855 --> 01:11:26,463
It's not Amazon it's these other resellers we're just doing the same game you're doing

1201
01:11:26,719 --> 01:11:28,511
Do you not understand it like you

1202
01:11:29,023 --> 01:11:31,583
Behaving in this way makes it okay for everyone.

1203
01:11:31,839 --> 01:11:33,375
Who cares about agreement

1204
01:11:33,631 --> 01:11:35,935
I feel like you fundamentally misunderstood

1205
01:11:37,215 --> 01:11:38,239
No I understand it

1206
01:11:38,495 --> 01:11:40,031
They're living it

1207
01:11:40,287 --> 01:11:42,079
Yeah but you drew you misunderstood it

1208
01:11:42,335 --> 01:11:43,615
The point is

1209
01:11:44,127 --> 01:11:48,223
Only wait what was the definition of prosperity

1210
01:11:48,735 --> 01:11:52,575
Send a text with Alex capitalism is great when you're

1211
01:11:52,831 --> 01:11:58,207
When your beneficiary and would all your rules are followed everyone just

1212
01:11:58,463 --> 01:12:04,607
Gets in line but

1213
01:12:06,399 --> 01:12:12,543
So this next clip Alex 58

1214
01:12:12,799 --> 01:12:16,127
Exactly Alex

1215
01:12:16,383 --> 01:12:17,663
Caller asks

1216
01:12:17,919 --> 01:12:18,431
Tim about a steak

1217
01:12:18,687 --> 01:12:19,199
Story

1218
01:12:19,455 --> 01:12:21,247
It's pretty interesting how I look

1219
01:12:21,503 --> 01:12:22,015
Response

1220
01:12:22,527 --> 01:12:23,551
Does Alex know about the

1221
01:12:24,063 --> 01:12:24,575
We'll see

1222
01:12:30,207 --> 01:12:32,255
Alex

1223
01:12:34,559 --> 01:12:40,703
Preciate all you do thank you for accepting the calling out here in Arizona Niles Amazon

1224
01:12:41,727 --> 01:12:46,335
Exactly

1225
01:12:46,591 --> 01:12:51,455
Baseball to your sources that you can talk about but it's insisted of the

1226
01:12:51,967 --> 01:12:55,295
CIA headquarters raided by the Marine recently mixed with

1227
01:12:55,551 --> 01:12:59,903
4094 districts which could be for

1228
01:13:00,415 --> 01:13:06,559
How to get related Mass arrests it could be nothing more than game prosecution consisting of

1229
01:13:06,815 --> 01:13:10,911
The question

1230
01:13:11,935 --> 01:13:13,215
Beaver

1231
01:13:13,727 --> 01:13:19,871
That's why I bring it up to you I didn't know if you had any more definitive

1232
01:13:27,039 --> 01:13:30,879
Real bombshell story

1233
01:13:33,951 --> 01:13:34,975
I have an alternative Theory

1234
01:13:35,487 --> 01:13:38,047
That is that a lot of people

1235
01:13:39,583 --> 01:13:40,607
And they post

1236
01:13:43,423 --> 01:13:44,447
It's not the globalist

1237
01:13:44,703 --> 01:13:46,751
Patriot news

1238
01:13:47,007 --> 01:13:47,519
Why did

1239
01:13:48,031 --> 01:13:50,079
Don't say in looking at these reports

1240
01:13:50,335 --> 01:13:50,847
What do you mean

1241
01:13:51,615 --> 01:13:52,383
Are there reports

1242
01:13:52,639 --> 01:13:55,967
Well they're like

1243
01:13:56,991 --> 01:13:58,271
Okay so this guy

1244
01:13:58,527 --> 01:14:03,903
What does referring to some sort of weird website where they posted blog

1245
01:14:04,159 --> 01:14:10,303
The military has invaded CIA headquarters there take down the Deep state

1246
01:14:16,959 --> 01:14:17,983
Isn't going to be like

1247
01:14:18,495 --> 01:14:24,639
Also did you know that they just raided the CIA headquarters

1248
01:14:24,895 --> 01:14:27,455
Pivots but you need to learn about how

1249
01:14:27,711 --> 01:14:31,295
How to tell if one of these callers is crazy

1250
01:14:31,551 --> 01:14:33,855
In plain sight to some degree

1251
01:14:35,647 --> 01:14:36,159
So like

1252
01:14:36,415 --> 01:14:38,207
He goes on to be like

1253
01:14:38,719 --> 01:14:40,255
They're probably going to take out

1254
01:14:40,511 --> 01:14:41,791
Maybe the military didn't

1255
01:14:42,047 --> 01:14:43,327
Hey babe

1256
01:14:43,583 --> 01:14:45,119
So I can take out all these pedophiles right

1257
01:14:45,375 --> 01:14:47,935
Now it's like yeah they are

1258
01:14:51,519 --> 01:14:52,031
CIA

1259
01:14:52,287 --> 01:14:53,823
You believe that the Murray

1260
01:14:55,103 --> 01:14:56,383
CIA

1261
01:14:56,639 --> 01:15:02,783
No Posse Comitatus

1262
01:15:03,039 --> 01:15:05,343
Show me the Marines do not operate

1263
01:15:05,599 --> 01:15:07,391
Arsenal

1264
01:15:07,647 --> 01:15:13,791
Investigating police Secret Service

1265
01:15:14,047 --> 01:15:16,607
Should have told him they're investigating

1266
01:15:16,863 --> 01:15:17,631
Hold on now

1267
01:15:17,887 --> 01:15:20,191
Do you know that the Secret Service they're only invest

1268
01:15:20,447 --> 01:15:26,591
The Gate of arm is about yes

1269
01:15:26,847 --> 01:15:27,871
Counterfeit money

1270
01:15:28,127 --> 01:15:29,919
Protecting the president

1271
01:15:30,175 --> 01:15:30,943
Physically

1272
01:15:31,199 --> 01:15:35,807
It's not about nobody ever really even knows why

1273
01:15:36,319 --> 01:15:42,463
That was just one of those weird de-facto things

1274
01:15:43,743 --> 01:15:46,559
Good people in the Marines are going to investigate

1275
01:15:46,815 --> 01:15:48,351
Storm

1276
01:15:49,887 --> 01:15:50,655
The Marines

1277
01:15:52,959 --> 01:15:53,727
The big one

1278
01:15:55,775 --> 01:15:57,823
Home commands

1279
01:15:58,079 --> 01:16:01,919
Quantico here's the problem that you don't understand

1280
01:16:02,175 --> 01:16:08,319
What does even a year into doing the podcast I really don't think that

1281
01:16:08,575 --> 01:16:09,599
Do you understand the dirt

1282
01:16:10,623 --> 01:16:14,207
Like weird websites that promote these sort of narrative

1283
01:16:14,719 --> 01:16:15,231
There are

1284
01:16:15,487 --> 01:16:17,023
Thousands of them out there

1285
01:16:17,279 --> 01:16:18,303
That people just stab

1286
01:16:19,839 --> 01:16:23,935
Oh I like this guy's right it's you know what it's a small version

1287
01:16:25,215 --> 01:16:25,727
Like

1288
01:16:26,751 --> 01:16:28,287
There are a thousand websites

1289
01:16:28,543 --> 01:16:30,335
That tell you what's going on with Russell

1290
01:16:30,847 --> 01:16:33,407
Successful version

1291
01:16:34,431 --> 01:16:37,759
No cuz no one else does

1292
01:16:38,015 --> 01:16:42,111
Yeah that's a good to take so long f****** time

1293
01:16:42,623 --> 01:16:45,695
There's a bunch of places where you can get varying degrees of

1294
01:16:45,951 --> 01:16:46,463
The same sort of

1295
01:16:46,975 --> 01:16:49,791
Nation about like what's going on in The Narrative of the WWE

1296
01:16:50,047 --> 01:16:56,191
Without the writing style you like and then some other guy

1297
01:16:56,447 --> 01:17:02,591
Text guy going to report guy or am I

1298
01:17:02,847 --> 01:17:03,359
Our friend

1299
01:17:03,615 --> 01:17:09,759
There are all the graduation

1300
01:17:10,015 --> 01:17:16,159
Congratulations

1301
01:17:17,439 --> 01:17:18,975
I'd like to tell him

1302
01:17:19,487 --> 01:17:21,279
Good luck

1303
01:17:21,791 --> 01:17:24,095
Good to hear is doing that it's

1304
01:17:24,351 --> 01:17:26,911
Very emotionally draining

1305
01:17:27,167 --> 01:17:27,935
Be that as it may

1306
01:17:28,703 --> 01:17:31,775
You have all these people need to choose whichever voice you want

1307
01:17:32,031 --> 01:17:33,311
In terms of like this

1308
01:17:33,567 --> 01:17:35,615
This appeals to me I like this waiting

1309
01:17:35,871 --> 01:17:37,151
World of Wings

1310
01:17:37,407 --> 01:17:39,455
Conspiracy s*** there is the same thing

1311
01:17:39,967 --> 01:17:42,271
In terms of there are tons of people were spitting

1312
01:17:42,783 --> 01:17:44,831
Fairly similar narratives on blogs

1313
01:17:45,087 --> 01:17:48,159
I like I like this guy's riding I'm going to subscribe to him

1314
01:17:48,415 --> 01:17:49,951
Evan becomes your

1315
01:17:50,207 --> 01:17:51,231
Place to get that news

1316
01:17:51,487 --> 01:17:54,047
There are hundreds of them on the Internet

1317
01:17:54,303 --> 01:17:55,071
And they're all

1318
01:17:55,583 --> 01:17:56,095
Full of s***

1319
01:17:56,351 --> 01:18:00,191
And most of them spit stuff like this right like the Marines

1320
01:18:00,447 --> 01:18:02,495
Invaded the CIA

1321
01:18:02,751 --> 01:18:03,519
Report

1322
01:18:04,799 --> 01:18:05,567
Rumor

1323
01:18:05,823 --> 01:18:07,871
Right

1324
01:18:08,127 --> 01:18:10,431
Sources have told us Bible.

1325
01:18:12,735 --> 01:18:14,527
But that's the mentality of almost about

1326
01:18:15,551 --> 01:18:16,319
You have to understand

1327
01:18:18,111 --> 01:18:20,671
But they believe stuff like that

1328
01:18:20,927 --> 01:18:22,975
CIA that would be a firefight

1329
01:18:23,743 --> 01:18:24,255
Totally

1330
01:18:24,511 --> 01:18:25,279
Would you remember like

1331
01:18:26,303 --> 01:18:30,655
9 months ago we did that episode where they used talking about how they had a fire fight it up

1332
01:18:30,911 --> 01:18:31,935
Pedophile compound

1333
01:18:32,191 --> 01:18:38,335
Yeah but that's not the reason but I think it was the Marines who had invaded the pedal

1334
01:18:38,591 --> 01:18:40,127
Survival compound or whatever they would make

1335
01:18:43,967 --> 01:18:46,271
Annamarie had a firefight

1336
01:18:47,039 --> 01:18:48,319
You don't know if there was

1337
01:18:48,575 --> 01:18:54,719
We do not know that there was their weapons changes

1338
01:18:54,975 --> 01:19:01,119
Reading the CIA headquarters sooner or later

1339
01:19:01,631 --> 01:19:03,167
People in the CIA

1340
01:19:03,423 --> 01:19:05,215
Do the killing those ones love Alec

1341
01:19:05,471 --> 01:19:07,263
Right now there's the pencil neck

1342
01:19:07,519 --> 01:19:11,359
Chickenshit about Larry Nichols

1343
01:19:11,615 --> 01:19:16,479
And jingles

1344
01:19:16,735 --> 01:19:17,503
The pencil pushers

1345
01:19:18,527 --> 01:19:24,671
No gun that no gunfire needs

1346
01:19:25,951 --> 01:19:29,279
I know I just want a movie where there's a war between the

1347
01:19:29,535 --> 01:19:30,815
Look

1348
01:19:31,071 --> 01:19:36,191
Even Alex Jones so I can know that this is b*******

1349
01:19:38,239 --> 01:19:38,751
The globalist

1350
01:19:39,007 --> 01:19:41,823
Engendered is very

1351
01:19:42,335 --> 01:19:43,103
Empowered and

1352
01:19:44,639 --> 01:19:46,943
Population

1353
01:19:48,479 --> 01:19:51,039
The CIA in the Marine battle that's like alien

1354
01:19:51,295 --> 01:19:54,367
Predator but way better but how do we do this without anyone knowing

1355
01:19:55,647 --> 01:19:56,415
That's going to be the entry

1356
01:19:58,207 --> 01:19:59,487
The CIA they're covering it up

1357
01:20:01,023 --> 01:20:04,351
That's it we're about to get into

1358
01:20:04,607 --> 01:20:07,423
The part of the show where I would say Alex loses it a little bit

1359
01:20:07,679 --> 01:20:09,471
Alien he doesn't want to talk to callers

1360
01:20:12,799 --> 01:20:14,592
He is sort of in a place where he's like

1361
01:20:15,104 --> 01:20:15,616
No more

1362
01:20:16,896 --> 01:20:19,456
Paul Joseph Watson going to host the fourth hour but I

1363
01:20:20,480 --> 01:20:22,272
I got a long way to go

1364
01:20:22,528 --> 01:20:24,576
There's one story that I really want to talk about

1365
01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:26,112
To it yet

1366
01:20:26,880 --> 01:20:27,904
I got to feel sometime

1367
01:20:28,672 --> 01:20:29,440
Let's talk about that

1368
01:20:30,208 --> 01:20:30,976
That's a good way to go

1369
01:20:31,232 --> 01:20:33,536
The Betrayal the deception

1370
01:20:41,216 --> 01:20:42,240
We have to be tested

1371
01:20:43,776 --> 01:20:45,568
Eternal consciousness

1372
01:20:45,824 --> 01:20:47,360
Great

1373
01:20:47,872 --> 01:20:49,152
System that we are

1374
01:20:56,064 --> 01:21:02,208
Engineers of Avila

1375
01:21:08,864 --> 01:21:12,448
Cops are just saying we're in the waiting room

1376
01:21:12,704 --> 01:21:13,728
Get manufactured

1377
01:21:15,776 --> 01:21:17,056
But got to get us to do it

1378
01:21:17,824 --> 01:21:22,176
They tried to get us made a God to build him his whole new universe

1379
01:21:24,992 --> 01:21:26,784
Batman

1380
01:21:33,440 --> 01:21:34,720
He's going to take them

1381
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:37,792
Devils already got robots

1382
01:21:43,424 --> 01:21:44,448
Need you

1383
01:21:47,520 --> 01:21:48,032
He asked you

1384
01:21:48,288 --> 01:21:49,056
You'll find out

1385
01:21:50,080 --> 01:21:50,848
That's a good point

1386
01:22:13,120 --> 01:22:14,400
That's my favorite thing

1387
01:22:15,680 --> 01:22:17,728
Finally after a year of doing this

1388
01:22:17,984 --> 01:22:19,520
Favorite thing

1389
01:22:20,032 --> 01:22:24,384
The devil he needs you to build him a new universe write anybody

1390
01:22:24,896 --> 01:22:31,040
He doesn't need you you'll find out such comedy like

1391
01:22:31,296 --> 01:22:32,320
In those pauses

1392
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:34,880
Cuz you not looking good

1393
01:22:36,160 --> 01:22:36,928
You know

1394
01:22:37,952 --> 01:22:40,000
At least some experience with Alex that like

1395
01:22:40,256 --> 01:22:42,816
As he's pausing there's just look on his face of like

1396
01:22:44,096 --> 01:22:48,704
I just devil has robot

1397
01:22:52,032 --> 01:22:56,896
Jim I just shot my wad with the devil I'm going to refractory. I guess

1398
01:22:57,152 --> 01:23:03,296
Do you want to talk about about what's going on

1399
01:23:03,552 --> 01:23:04,064
That's like

1400
01:23:04,576 --> 01:23:05,344
Their moments

1401
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:06,624
Alex Ware

1402
01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:09,184
He does something accidentally and just cuz you

1403
01:23:09,440 --> 01:23:15,584
He's kind of panicking a little bit that are 10 times funnier than any joke I've ever heard inside out

1404
01:23:15,840 --> 01:23:17,888
I've never heard anything funnier than that

1405
01:23:20,448 --> 01:23:24,032
Cuz you know what Alex accidentally understands

1406
01:23:24,544 --> 01:23:27,360
Tension and release

1407
01:23:31,456 --> 01:23:37,600
Bob Hope ever wrote there's so much tension that's built up with this idea of like the devil is trying to

1408
01:23:37,856 --> 01:23:40,672
Create a make us create in the University's going to kill us

1409
01:23:40,928 --> 01:23:47,072
Biblical law the long pauses cervix Stilwell atoms of building up the tension

1410
01:23:47,328 --> 01:23:50,912
Then the release the punchline

1411
01:23:52,960 --> 01:23:56,800
If I were Jim in Toronto

1412
01:23:57,824 --> 01:24:03,200
I don't want to come to Stage 2 that I supposed to follow that

1413
01:24:03,456 --> 01:24:06,016
Consequential

1414
01:24:06,272 --> 01:24:09,856
Following devil worship

1415
01:24:10,112 --> 01:24:13,184
Kim Possible

1416
01:24:13,696 --> 01:24:15,488
Alex

1417
01:24:15,744 --> 01:24:17,792
Asserts that the

1418
01:24:18,048 --> 01:24:19,072
Of women

1419
01:24:19,584 --> 01:24:22,144
Talking about how they have also been sexually harassed

1420
01:24:22,656 --> 01:24:23,168
Antabuse

1421
01:24:23,424 --> 01:24:26,752
Just about trying to attack me

1422
01:24:27,008 --> 01:24:31,104
It's already out most of its bulshit trying to attack

1423
01:24:32,128 --> 01:24:32,896
Toxic masculinity

1424
01:24:33,664 --> 01:24:35,968
But also

1425
01:24:36,224 --> 01:24:38,272
Beyond that

1426
01:24:41,344 --> 01:24:42,624
A little bit and this next

1427
01:24:42,880 --> 01:24:45,184
He should just not do it like if I was him

1428
01:24:45,440 --> 01:24:46,720
If I was just giving him advice

1429
01:24:46,976 --> 01:24:50,304
Which once again we should not be doing and get a few hires up

1430
01:24:50,560 --> 01:24:51,584
4A

1431
01:24:52,352 --> 01:24:52,864
Good amount

1432
01:24:54,144 --> 01:24:57,728
I would think about it I'd like to meet Daria

1433
01:25:00,288 --> 01:25:05,920
Pretend that never happened with him pretending it didn't happen is that there's too many records of what he

1434
01:25:06,176 --> 01:25:06,944
She said back then

1435
01:25:07,200 --> 01:25:13,344
We have records of all the s*** he said it hasn't mattered about all that here and then on the other end

1436
01:25:15,648 --> 01:25:16,160
Miss you then

1437
01:25:16,928 --> 01:25:17,696
Free

1438
01:25:18,976 --> 01:25:20,768
They're obviously reading this for Trump

1439
01:25:21,024 --> 01:25:24,608
That's what he's been getting

1440
01:25:25,376 --> 01:25:27,168
Here's a low-tech example of what they do

1441
01:25:33,312 --> 01:25:35,616
10 months ago before she left Fox News

1442
01:25:36,640 --> 01:25:39,456
Alex Jones saying Hillary

1443
01:25:39,712 --> 01:25:41,504
Portrait children to death in the basement

1444
01:25:41,760 --> 01:25:42,784
Other pizza place

1445
01:25:46,112 --> 01:25:48,928
But no kiss before Alex gets into it he's kind of

1446
01:25:49,184 --> 01:25:50,208
Fair on this

1447
01:25:50,720 --> 01:25:54,304
They Megyn Kelly on her show did Play a clip out of context

1448
01:25:54,816 --> 01:25:56,096
In a report about

1449
01:25:56,864 --> 01:26:00,448
Yeah but the issue is that Alex is being super unclear about what

1450
01:26:00,960 --> 01:26:01,728
Talkin about

1451
01:26:01,984 --> 01:26:04,032
Pulled from

1452
01:26:04,288 --> 01:26:04,800
RLX

1453
01:26:05,312 --> 01:26:07,872
And the other problem is that Alex

1454
01:26:08,384 --> 01:26:11,200
His point that he's going to make when I keep playing the clip

1455
01:26:11,456 --> 01:26:13,248
Is that Hillary Clinton

1456
01:26:13,504 --> 01:26:15,808
Through her support of the oven

1457
01:26:16,064 --> 01:26:20,928
Withrow of Libya is responsible for the raven

1458
01:26:21,184 --> 01:26:22,720
Killing of children what-have-you

1459
01:26:23,232 --> 01:26:24,768
But the problem is in that clip

1460
01:26:25,536 --> 01:26:27,072
He says

1461
01:26:27,328 --> 01:26:29,888
She personally raped and murdered these

1462
01:26:30,144 --> 01:26:32,448
His children and stuff like that which is

1463
01:26:32,960 --> 01:26:34,752
Linguistically difficult

1464
01:26:35,008 --> 01:26:41,152
I understand why a overburden researcher clip puller for MSNBC or 5

1465
01:26:41,408 --> 01:26:43,712
Fox News something like that

1466
01:26:43,968 --> 01:26:45,760
It's not necessarily the most.

1467
01:26:46,272 --> 01:26:47,296
Beautiful thing but Alex

1468
01:26:47,552 --> 01:26:48,320
Is also right

1469
01:26:49,344 --> 01:26:50,624
They did take it a bit out of

1470
01:26:50,880 --> 01:26:53,440
Contact

1471
01:26:53,696 --> 01:26:56,256
Said out loud that Obama

1472
01:26:56,512 --> 01:26:57,280
Personally

1473
01:26:57,536 --> 01:27:01,120
Is responsible for the not even personally responsible for

1474
01:27:01,376 --> 01:27:02,912
Does not personally did

1475
01:27:03,424 --> 01:27:03,936
Sing

1476
01:27:04,448 --> 01:27:06,496
That's the language you used

1477
01:27:06,752 --> 01:27:12,640
See now that's a different situation that's why I'm that's why I G

1478
01:27:12,896 --> 01:27:18,016
She's personally responsible for this Friday to bring your Obama comparison

1479
01:27:18,272 --> 01:27:24,416
Do the shaky allowed to happen if you're making decisions on that level

1480
01:27:25,440 --> 01:27:26,976
Your decisions are going to lead to a trot

1481
01:27:27,232 --> 01:27:30,816
Exactly in her capacity as secretary

1482
01:27:31,072 --> 01:27:34,912
Responsible

1483
01:27:35,168 --> 01:27:36,960
But when you use the language of

1484
01:27:37,472 --> 01:27:43,360
Personally raped and murdered children

1485
01:27:43,616 --> 01:27:44,128
He's using

1486
01:27:44,384 --> 01:27:44,896
This

1487
01:27:45,152 --> 01:27:48,224
Decent point he has to lie about a more

1488
01:27:48,992 --> 01:27:50,528
Salient point that he should watch his

1489
01:27:50,784 --> 01:27:51,552
Is language

1490
01:27:53,856 --> 01:27:55,392
Iran

1493
01:28:07,424 --> 01:28:07,936
Disgust

1494
01:28:08,192 --> 01:28:10,240
Alex Jones had to give a formal apology

1495
01:28:11,520 --> 01:28:17,664
Which I didn't say

1496
01:28:17,920 --> 01:28:24,064
Car that have sold into slavery by the tens of thousands murdered women

1497
01:28:39,168 --> 01:28:40,960
That was rear-ended

1498
01:28:42,240 --> 01:28:45,312
I do this whole rant about that and she has together

1499
01:28:52,480 --> 01:28:55,296
And they put it out I'm sick she's in the basement herself

1502
01:28:59,136 --> 01:29:03,232
Mix it around

1503

F*** you

1508
01:29:36,512 --> 01:29:39,328
What was happening

1509
01:29:41,376 --> 01:29:44,192
Petter supposedly I need to know

1510
01:29:44,960 --> 01:29:46,752
So a couple of very Salient facts

1511
01:29:47,008 --> 01:29:48,288
But need to be brought up

1512
01:29:48,544 --> 01:29:50,848
1

1513
01:29:51,104 --> 01:29:52,128
And fired his rifle

1514
01:29:52,640 --> 01:29:55,712
5 interview said that he was tired

1515
01:29:56,224 --> 01:29:57,760
I listen to Infowars

1516
01:29:58,016 --> 01:29:59,296
Save those children

1517
01:29:59,552 --> 01:30:00,832
I need to go get to the bottom of it

1518
01:30:01,088 --> 01:30:05,440
Clips that will you play that Alex has to delete from the internet on successful

1519
01:30:05,696 --> 01:30:07,488
He is said someone should go look into this

1520
01:30:10,304 --> 01:30:14,144
Why that guy did

1521
01:30:14,400 --> 01:30:15,680
One of those

1522
01:30:15,936 --> 01:30:16,960
Second Amendment folks

1523
01:30:19,520 --> 01:30:20,288
Trump and say

1524
01:30:20,544 --> 01:30:23,360
You were the one who said I hope the Second Amendment

1525

Go after Hillary

1526
01:30:25,920 --> 01:30:29,760
Weird the other thing I need to bring into focus is that

1527
01:30:30,016 --> 01:30:30,528
The last

1528
01:30:31,552 --> 01:30:32,832
Alex Jones had a Gaston

1529
01:30:33,088 --> 01:30:33,600

To talk about Bitcoin

1531
01:30:35,392 --> 01:30:36,672
Here's a Bitcoin expert

1532
01:30:36,928 --> 01:30:39,488
A Bitcoin expert by the name of Dave Seaman

1533
01:30:40,768 --> 01:30:44,352
And you don't know who that guy is I remember A Man Named Dave Seaman

1534
01:30:44,608 --> 01:30:45,376

1535
01:30:46,656 --> 01:30:47,168
Is a funny name

1536
01:30:47,936 --> 01:30:48,704
Dave Seaman

1537
01:30:48,960 --> 01:30:49,472

1538
01:30:49,728 --> 01:30:50,240

1545
01:31:17,120 --> 01:31:17,888

Is the globalist were coming after him because of his knowledge of Bitcoin

1555
01:31:44,768 --> 01:31:50,912
I can't stress this enough his videos are gone from the internet but I watch this unfold in real-time

1556
01:31:51,168 --> 01:31:53,728
Watching the entire pizzagate thing happens from

1557
01:31:53,984 --> 01:31:55,520

Onnit

1562
01:32:05,248 --> 01:32:09,088
Where he's trying to make it all about the things that were said in the WikiLeaks

1563
01:32:09,344 --> 01:32:13,184
Squinting

1564
01:32:13,440 --> 01:32:15,744
No it's all there

Is a devil worshiper basement killing kids

1567
01:32:23,680 --> 01:32:24,192
He was

1568
01:32:24,448 --> 01:32:25,472
A hundred percent

1569
01:32:25,728 --> 01:32:27,264
The most prominent figure

1570
01:32:27,520 --> 01:32:28,544
Who was pushing that stuff

1571
01:32:29,824 --> 01:32:30,592
Created a hoax

1572
01:32:30,848 --> 01:32:31,616
About people trying to

1573
01:32:31,872 --> 01:32:32,640
The Killing

1574
01:32:32,896 --> 01:32:34,688
Pretended he had to get off the grid

1575
01:32:34,944 --> 01:32:40,832
And disappear to a cabin somewhere

1576
01:32:41,088 --> 01:32:42,112
That sort of s*** right

1577
01:32:42,368 --> 01:32:45,696
George Lucas tried to tell us that he never invented minute

1578
01:32:47,744 --> 01:32:48,256
Vulture

1579
01:32:48,512 --> 01:32:49,792
Bulshit Lucas

1580
01:32:50,048 --> 01:32:54,912
Exactly that one's on you man on his show

1581
01:32:55,168 --> 01:32:56,448
In the last week

1582
01:32:57,216 --> 01:32:58,240
As a repurposed

1583
01:32:58,752 --> 01:32:59,776
Bitcoin enthusiasts

1584
01:33:00,288 --> 01:33:00,800
When

1585
01:33:01,056 --> 01:33:01,824
He is not

1586
01:33:02,080 --> 01:33:03,360
He is one of the

1587
01:33:03,616 --> 01:33:09,760
People who I'd like to hear

1588
01:33:10,784 --> 01:33:11,808
Post about this

1589
01:33:12,576 --> 01:33:13,856
You likened it to

1590
01:33:14,112 --> 01:33:14,624
Came

1591
01:33:14,880 --> 01:33:15,392
Yes

1592
01:33:15,648 --> 01:33:19,488
Before he was Cain he was Dr Isaac yankem

1593
01:33:20,256 --> 01:33:21,792
He was a wrestling dentist

1594
01:33:22,304 --> 01:33:28,448
Alright

1595
01:33:29,984 --> 01:33:36,128
Don't work if they're doing the same game

1596
01:33:36,640 --> 01:33:37,152
I was being too

1597
01:33:39,712 --> 01:33:45,344
But it's the same thing that I am done with himself he's repackaged what he said about pizzagate

1598
01:33:47,392 --> 01:33:51,488
And allowed Dave Siemens come on his show as a Bitcoin

1599
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:54,048
ABC Monroe to book about Buzz

1600
01:33:54,560 --> 01:33:56,096
About how he's all about Buzz

1601
01:33:56,352 --> 01:33:59,424
And how he would deny the existence of air that got him attention

1602
01:33:59,680 --> 01:34:05,824
So maybe we don't need to pay attention to what you're saying then exclamation

1603
01:34:06,336 --> 01:34:06,848
Listen to some

1604
01:34:07,104 --> 01:34:10,176
Exact yourself and then let's go further another step

1605
01:34:10,432 --> 01:34:16,320
Alex has Jack the sobiech on the all the time who was another proponent of the literal pizzagate

1606
01:34:16,576 --> 01:34:20,416
Went to Comet Ping Pong

1607
01:34:20,672 --> 01:34:21,184
Red

1608
01:34:21,440 --> 01:34:27,584
Spurious rumors about the video

1609
01:34:27,840 --> 01:34:30,400
Direct on their own

1610
01:34:30,656 --> 01:34:32,448
About this stuff and it's not okay

1611
01:34:32,704 --> 01:34:33,728
Not okay

1612
01:34:34,496 --> 01:34:35,264
Pissed off about it

1613
01:34:35,776 --> 01:34:37,056
I'm super pissed off about it

1614
01:34:37,824 --> 01:34:39,104
Bulshit

1615
01:34:39,616 --> 01:34:40,128
And these dudes

1616
01:34:40,384 --> 01:34:44,992
Are disabled

1617
01:34:45,248 --> 01:34:47,296
He protects those videos are still around

1618
01:34:49,344 --> 01:34:50,368
All these guys

1619
01:34:50,624 --> 01:34:51,136
Or just

1620
01:34:51,648 --> 01:34:54,464
Engaged in large-scale fraud

1621
01:34:54,720 --> 01:34:58,304
They're engaged in large-scale lying and manipulation

1622
01:34:58,560 --> 01:35:03,424
And then what it doesn't work out there like I wasn't saying that

1623
01:35:04,448 --> 01:35:05,472
Videos Man

1624
01:35:05,728 --> 01:35:08,544
Videos of intelligent

1625
01:35:08,800 --> 01:35:09,568
This is not

1626
01:35:10,336 --> 01:35:11,104
This isn't okay

1627
01:35:11,616 --> 01:35:12,384
You can't get away with this

1628
01:35:15,200 --> 01:35:16,224
I'm furious

1629
01:35:17,760 --> 01:35:23,648
I agree with you

1630
01:35:24,160 --> 01:35:30,304
Main difference I was listening to that rent going like f****** keep on going

1631
01:35:31,328 --> 01:35:36,448
Listen to my rants like this f****** guy better shut up I've got more facts

1632
01:35:36,704 --> 01:35:38,752
To get to

1633
01:35:39,008 --> 01:35:41,824
You dare that was great I enjoyed it

1634
01:35:42,080 --> 01:35:48,224
How dare you giving you positive reinforcement expense criticism

1635
01:35:48,480 --> 01:35:54,624
Portsmouth he's criticism of you

1636
01:35:54,880 --> 01:35:57,952
Using the powers of enforcement

1637
01:35:58,208 --> 01:36:02,816
To chastise you for the wave God

1638
01:36:03,584 --> 01:36:07,680
FairPoint

1639
01:36:08,704 --> 01:36:10,752
I love you Dad love you too

1640
01:36:11,008 --> 01:36:14,336
Observe this next clip this one we're going to have fun with

1641
01:36:14,592 --> 01:36:16,640
This next clip is actually going to be fun

1642
01:36:18,688 --> 01:36:20,224
There's nothing better than

1643
01:36:20,480 --> 01:36:22,784
Two people having a moment of where it's like

1644
01:36:23,040 --> 01:36:29,184
Alright

1645
01:36:29,440 --> 01:36:35,584
It doesn't matter

1646
01:36:35,840 --> 01:36:36,608
Conceived this shows

1647
01:36:36,864 --> 01:36:38,912
Lightly like Mystery Science Theater in the center

1648
01:36:39,168 --> 01:36:43,776
That we are trapped in this room talking about something that neither of us would like to

1649
01:36:44,032 --> 01:36:44,800
Agree

1650
01:36:45,056 --> 01:36:51,200
We just got movie sign it's time to get back to the business I have never had a like

1651
01:36:51,456 --> 01:36:56,576
When we first started there were plenty of times where you were listening to be talked over the clips like

1652
01:36:57,600 --> 01:37:03,744
Are you doing and now you kind of felt like that's what I've always thought of it as if you anywhere listening except for the point where I

1653
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:08,864
Is this turned out an angle where that makes sense

1654
01:37:09,120 --> 01:37:13,984
Servo every now and again

1655
01:37:14,240 --> 01:37:20,128
Actually get to a little bit

1656
01:37:20,384 --> 01:37:26,528
That much shut up

1657
01:37:27,040 --> 01:37:29,344
We can actually have some fun

1658
01:37:29,600 --> 01:37:31,136
As Alex Jones misrepresent

1659
01:37:31,648 --> 01:37:37,792
Another right-wing sexual abuser in a very comical way

1660
01:37:38,048 --> 01:37:38,560
Great

1661
01:37:38,816 --> 01:37:39,840
Grapevine

1662
01:37:40,096 --> 01:37:40,864
He's great in the new version

1663
01:37:41,120 --> 01:37:41,632
Fine

1664
01:37:41,888 --> 01:37:43,680
What is gentleman

1665
01:37:46,496 --> 01:37:49,824
Regardless

1666
01:37:50,080 --> 01:37:51,104
Face value

1667
01:37:51,360 --> 01:37:55,456
After you have experts

1668
01:37:55,712 --> 01:38:01,856
Warriors

1669
01:38:02,112 --> 01:38:07,744
Like

1670
01:38:08,512 --> 01:38:14,656
I really sore

1671
01:38:16,192 --> 01:38:21,312
You're going to have sex with a sandwich I mean it was really

1672
01:38:22,080 --> 01:38:26,176
O'Reilly

1673
01:38:33,344 --> 01:38:36,160
But

1674
01:38:36,672 --> 01:38:38,720
What's 15 million

1675
01:38:44,608 --> 01:38:47,680
Chocolate really stupid

1676
01:38:50,496 --> 01:38:52,544
There's lots of examples

1677
01:38:52,800 --> 01:38:55,360
Cherry outfit

1678
01:38:55,872 --> 01:38:57,408
So here's what I want to say

1679
01:38:57,664 --> 01:39:03,808
The end I like everything else like everything clear

1680
01:39:04,064 --> 01:39:08,416
So I wouldn't most telling

1681
01:39:09,696 --> 01:39:10,976
So now what he's talkin about with

1682
01:39:11,232 --> 01:39:12,256
Diego Chavez sandwich

1683
01:39:12,512 --> 01:39:13,792
Spandex

1684
01:39:14,304 --> 01:39:15,072
Do you want know about this

1685
01:39:16,352 --> 01:39:20,960
No why would I know so Bill O'Reilly when he got in trouble for the sexual harassment

1686
01:39:21,216 --> 01:39:23,776
Stuff last time or the time before last

1687
01:39:25,312 --> 01:39:28,128
Did the classic one

1688
01:39:28,384 --> 01:39:34,528
Yes and the ones like Matt Lauer the front with the one from years back involved to call that he made to a lady was talking to

1689
01:39:34,784 --> 01:39:36,064
Falafel

1690
01:39:36,576 --> 01:39:37,088
Around

1691
01:39:37,344 --> 01:39:38,880
He meant

1692
01:39:39,136 --> 01:39:39,904
Human loofah

1693
01:39:40,160 --> 01:39:41,440
You just didn't know the word

1694
01:39:42,464 --> 01:39:46,048
What is very clear that he was talking about robbing a loofah around

1695
01:39:46,560 --> 01:39:47,328
What

1696
01:39:47,584 --> 01:39:49,120
Bill O'Reilly thought

1697
01:39:49,376 --> 01:39:55,520
A roofer was Falafel he's probably drunk or on pills or something like that just was like

1698
01:39:55,776 --> 01:39:56,544
Falafel

1699
01:40:02,688 --> 01:40:04,224
Clip giving out fake news

1700
01:40:04,480 --> 01:40:09,344
But innocent is it is entirely

1701
01:40:11,136 --> 01:40:14,464
Which I've done

1702
01:40:15,232 --> 01:40:16,768
Did you say you do

1703
01:40:17,024 --> 01:40:20,864
Use chocolate sauce a whole bunch of live your life

1704
01:40:21,120 --> 01:40:23,936
Why would that do

1705
01:40:24,192 --> 01:40:26,496
Falafel not count in the same Vape

1706
01:40:26,752 --> 01:40:32,896
I think it would be structurally and logistically much more difficult than chocolate sauce using essential oil

1707
01:40:36,992 --> 01:40:37,504
Okay

1708
01:40:37,760 --> 01:40:38,272
I shan't

1709
01:40:38,528 --> 01:40:40,064
A b look

1710
01:40:40,576 --> 01:40:42,624
I don't want to talk about that stuff like logistic

1711
01:40:42,880 --> 01:40:45,440
Pics of sex with food I want

1712
01:40:45,696 --> 01:40:46,208
Fajitas

1713
01:40:46,464 --> 01:40:50,816
Bad idea I want to talk about the fact that

1714
01:40:51,328 --> 01:40:52,096
Even liberal

1715
01:40:52,608 --> 01:40:55,168
When they make fun of the Falafel stuff it's

1716
01:40:55,424 --> 01:40:57,216
Because everyone knows he misspoke

1717
01:40:57,728 --> 01:40:59,008
Was talking about a loofah

1718
01:40:59,520 --> 01:41:02,080
Alex legitimately is presenting it as like

1719
01:41:02,336 --> 01:41:03,872
Hey bro you like sex with sandwiches

1720
01:41:04,128 --> 01:41:06,176
Don't call your producer with that

1721
01:41:08,992 --> 01:41:11,552
That's one piece of

1722
01:41:12,064 --> 01:41:14,624
More important

1723
01:41:14,880 --> 01:41:21,024
Don't sexually assault your producer with that with sandwich

1724
01:41:21,280 --> 01:41:21,792
But the fact that

1725
01:41:22,048 --> 01:41:23,328
He doesn't know that

1726
01:41:23,840 --> 01:41:26,912
Like it's a very easily explainable

1727
01:41:27,936 --> 01:41:29,984
Well the fact that he thinks the problem

1728
01:41:31,520 --> 01:41:32,032
Sandwich Joy

1729
01:41:33,312 --> 01:41:33,824
Sure

1730
01:41:34,080 --> 01:41:35,872
Maybe a larger issue

1731
01:41:36,128 --> 01:41:42,272
Problem is so much further

1732
01:41:42,528 --> 01:41:44,320
Towards the beginning of the question

1733
01:41:44,576 --> 01:41:46,624
Then when you get all the way to sandwich

1734
01:41:47,392 --> 01:41:48,672
Totally like there's

1735
01:41:48,928 --> 01:41:50,976
Like there's a long time ago

1736
01:41:51,232 --> 01:41:55,840
Like all the way up to sandwiches

1737
01:41:56,608 --> 01:41:59,680
You are totally right big picture butts

1738
01:41:59,936 --> 01:42:05,824
Alex Jones podcast and that seems like such an elementary point I'm more fixated on the fact that he is

1739
01:42:06,336 --> 01:42:11,968
Will. Is there a Riley was actually talking about

1740
01:42:12,224 --> 01:42:16,320
This is our Bill O'Reilly's Nancy Pelosi

1741
01:42:16,576 --> 01:42:20,672
Sure Riley's denial he doesn't even know what the fuc

1742
01:42:20,928 --> 01:42:23,744
Next clip Alex talks about David

1743
01:42:24,256 --> 01:42:25,280

1744
01:42:25,792 --> 01:42:26,816

1745
01:42:32,704 --> 01:42:33,472

1746
01:42:34,240 --> 01:42:35,008
What's the weather today

1747
01:42:35,264 --> 01:42:35,776
Don't do it

1748
01:42:36,544 --> 01:42:37,056
Yelled at the person

1749
01:42:38,336 --> 01:42:39,360
So really bad about it

1750
01:42:40,384 --> 01:42:40,896
She's not listening to

1751
01:42:42,944 --> 01:42:45,248

Jardinera

1756
01:42:54,464 --> 01:42:56,256
What is the oil

1757
01:42:56,512 --> 01:43:02,656
That is a problem spicy oil is delicious

1758
01:43:02,912 --> 01:43:09,056
View all the way up

1759
01:43:09,312 --> 01:43:15,456
Too much

1760
01:43:15,968 --> 01:43:16,480
Be very happy

1761
01:43:16,736 --> 01:43:18,016
Just take

1762
01:43:18,272 --> 01:43:19,552
Pressing down the spoon

1763
01:43:19,808 --> 01:43:21,856
And then you got the oil and you can put it on the sandwich

1764
01:43:30,304 --> 01:43:31,840
Then you felt guilty about it

1765
01:43:32,096 --> 01:43:32,608
Weeks after

1766
01:43:32,864 --> 01:43:39,008

As you got to scoop

1771
01:43:46,432 --> 01:43:47,456
Mostly

1772
01:43:47,968 --> 01:43:50,272
More competent

1773
01:43:50,784 --> 01:43:56,928
The sandwich employee that you are working today wanted to have a conversation about it wouldn't help

1774
01:43:57,184 --> 01:43:58,976
You just started going in MN

1775
01:43:59,232 --> 01:44:01,024
Poured it on that

01:44:01,280 --> 01:44:03,328
I have there goes a carrot

1777
01:44:03,584 --> 01:44:05,888
She's only because she's being paid like 9 bucks

1778
01:44:07,680 --> 01:44:08,448
She gets whatever she wants

1779
01:44:09,472 --> 01:44:10,240
I will accept

1780
01:44:12,544 --> 01:44:15,872
Any inconvenience from a fast food employee because it's like

1781
01:44:16,128 --> 01:44:16,896

And she didn't believe him at all

1792
01:44:56,832 --> 01:44:59,392
Sitting there trying to order my sandwich and cheese it's been like

1793
01:45:00,416 --> 01:45:00,928

01:45:01,184 --> 01:45:02,720
Walk me through this one more time

Do this in an office store

1796
01:45:11,168 --> 01:45:12,448
Asking the manager

You are getting a saint

1800
01:45:21,152 --> 01:45:27,296
Just sitting right next to where I'm ordering my sandwich

1801
01:45:29,088 --> 01:45:31,136
Nobody's asked you

1802

My quote was

1806
01:45:46,240 --> 01:45:46,752
Which is

1807
01:45:47,008 --> 01:45:53,152

1853
01:48:48,768 --> 01:48:49,280
Report it

1854
01:48:49,536 --> 01:48:51,328
The billionaire philanthropist David Rockefeller

1855
01:48:51,584 --> 01:48:52,608
Successfully undergone his

1856
01:48:52,864 --> 01:48:55,680
Six heart transplant years of the venerable age of

1857
01:48:55,936 --> 01:48:57,216
Years old

1858
01:48:57,728 --> 01:48:59,776
The article also reported

1859
01:49:01,312 --> 01:49:07,456
Everytime I get swept across my body I feel regener-eyes Dental I

1860
01:49:07,712 --> 01:49:12,576
Sounds that sounds like a fake quote however this news was not reported by any other credible Outlet

1861
01:49:12,832 --> 01:49:14,624
Because it was probably because

1862
01:49:14,880 --> 01:49:15,648
It was a

1863
01:49:15,904 --> 01:49:19,488
About the alleged heartlessness and entitlement of the wealthy

1864
01:49:19,744 --> 01:49:21,024
From the fake news

1865
01:49:21,280 --> 01:49:22,816
Worldnewsdailyreport

1866
01:49:23,072 --> 01:49:25,632
Who's the disclaimer page

1867
01:49:25,888 --> 01:49:30,496
And besides articles are not meant to be taken truthfully here's a quote from there there about

1868
01:49:31,264 --> 01:49:34,592
Worldnewsdailyreport publication

1869
01:49:35,104 --> 01:49:39,200
Not use real name

1870
01:49:39,456 --> 01:49:41,504
All news articles contained within

1871
01:49:41,760 --> 01:49:45,088
Worldnewsdailyreport.com or fiction

1872
01:49:45,344 --> 01:49:48,928
Any resemblance is purely coincidental

1873
01:49:49,184 --> 01:49:49,696
Politicians

1874
01:49:49,952 --> 01:49:50,720
Adore celebrities

1875
01:49:50,976 --> 01:49:53,280
In which case they are based on real people but

1876
01:49:55,584 --> 01:49:57,888
Write an onion article about Dick Cheney

1877
01:49:58,144 --> 01:50:00,704
But but

1878
01:50:00,960 --> 01:50:03,776
But it is true that he did have multiple heart transplant

1879
01:50:04,288 --> 01:50:05,312
Any live to 100

1880
01:50:05,824 --> 01:50:09,920
He had multiple heart yeah I'm not sure exact number but

1881
01:50:10,176 --> 01:50:11,200
Shouldn't be allowed to do that

1882
01:50:11,456 --> 01:50:14,784
If you're superrich you did over the f*** you want

1883
01:50:15,296 --> 01:50:18,624
You can do whatever the f*** you want it turns out but it this this

1884
01:50:18,880 --> 01:50:21,184
Particular

1885
01:50:21,440 --> 01:50:22,208
Totally

1886
01:50:22,464 --> 01:50:24,256
No I did this particular case Alex's

1887
01:50:24,768 --> 01:50:27,328
Specifically the last episode we talked about how he is

1888
01:50:27,584 --> 01:50:33,728
Just responding to a chain letter by using World News Daily

1889
01:50:33,984 --> 01:50:34,496
Report

1890
01:50:34,752 --> 01:50:37,056
Satirical News website as a

1891
01:50:37,312 --> 01:50:40,128
Did you know that a week before Bilderberg

1892
01:50:40,384 --> 01:50:41,920
You know it's kind of sad

1893
01:50:42,432 --> 01:50:46,528
I prefer I wish I lived in a world where you could just get a

1894
01:50:47,296 --> 01:50:48,576
Son of heart transplants and you'd be

1895
01:50:49,344 --> 01:50:54,720
We can if you have tons and tons of money

1896
01:50:54,976 --> 01:50:56,768
He should have lived to 161

1897
01:50:57,024 --> 01:50:59,840
You know what I'm saying like you should have got every Newhart

1898
01:51:00,096 --> 01:51:00,608
Shiva time

1899
01:51:00,864 --> 01:51:01,376
My bad

1900
01:51:01,632 --> 01:51:02,144
Bad bad

1901
01:51:03,168 --> 01:51:09,312
Our boy Randy Cramer is going to get that Kickstarter going

1902
01:51:09,568 --> 01:51:10,336
Information

1903
01:51:10,848 --> 01:51:11,872
So excited

1904
01:51:13,152 --> 01:51:13,664
The point is

1905
01:51:15,456 --> 01:51:17,760
He had some wealth

1906
01:51:21,600 --> 01:51:23,136
But it was a will

1907
01:51:26,976 --> 01:51:29,536
Without tables power

1908
01:51:30,304 --> 01:51:33,632
Georgia hold on to this life as long as he could eat it

1909
01:51:37,728 --> 01:51:39,776
You know where Dad's Rockefeller does now

1910
01:51:41,056 --> 01:51:43,616
France Brothers.

1911
01:51:43,872 --> 01:51:45,152
No more blood to suck

1912
01:51:46,432 --> 01:51:47,456
Vampires

1913
01:51:47,968 --> 01:51:50,016
In their Eternal death

1914
01:51:50,272 --> 01:51:52,064
Interspiritual coffins

1915
01:51:53,600 --> 01:51:54,880
Alone

1916
01:51:56,928 --> 01:51:57,440
I heard the tone

1917
01:52:01,536 --> 01:52:02,048
That's nothing

1918
01:52:06,144 --> 01:52:11,776
I said I go your calls not I. And I did but I am Jeff

1919
01:52:12,032 --> 01:52:13,312
Boheme

1920
01:52:15,872 --> 01:52:19,968
Clint Lewis I'll get to all those calls for the transmission

1921
01:52:20,224 --> 01:52:26,368
I got to say this or we don't feel fun or so Plus

1922
01:52:31,744 --> 01:52:37,376
The perfect person we can

1923
01:52:38,400 --> 01:52:38,912
Great

1924
01:52:39,680 --> 01:52:45,824
Difference in you see the difference in affect

1925
01:52:46,080 --> 01:52:48,384
North Georgia still performing

1926
01:52:52,992 --> 01:52:59,136
Hey we got new sales on everything is good I can do better version

1927
01:53:08,608 --> 01:53:13,216
That I sell s*** cuz it's a defensive

1928
01:53:13,472 --> 01:53:19,616
Yeah gets really excited defensively like everyone like vitamins

1929
01:53:19,872 --> 01:53:24,224
All right it's not it's so performative

1930
01:53:24,480 --> 01:53:27,552
Did you think that a normal human being

1931
01:53:27,808 --> 01:53:29,344
Would have that as like

1932
01:53:29,856 --> 01:53:30,624
Their path

1933
01:53:32,928 --> 01:53:35,232
Experience their path of how they wanted

1934
01:53:35,488 --> 01:53:39,072
Rhetorically do a show

1935
01:53:39,328 --> 01:53:40,096
So fake

1936
01:53:40,352 --> 01:53:41,888
If you word it it's like

1937
01:53:42,912 --> 01:53:44,448
I often think about this

1938
01:53:44,704 --> 01:53:45,216
Like

1939
01:53:45,472 --> 01:53:46,240
You and I

1940
01:53:46,752 --> 01:53:48,544
If you and I were

1941
01:53:48,800 --> 01:53:50,080
And Alex Jones's position

1942
01:53:50,592 --> 01:53:54,432
And we were doing the show where we were convinced that the globalist

1943
01:53:54,688 --> 01:53:55,968
We're trying to kill everybody

1944
01:53:56,992 --> 01:53:58,272
Yeah what we would do

1945
01:53:58,528 --> 01:54:04,672
Like how would we behave ourselves globalist

1946
01:54:05,184 --> 01:54:05,952
Ultra-wealthy

1947
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:10,304
No cuz I really don't think that they are trying to

1948
01:54:10,560 --> 01:54:12,352
To kill us I think they just don't care

1949
01:54:14,656 --> 01:54:17,472
Conversation that we could get into

1950
01:54:17,728 --> 01:54:18,240
4

1951
01:54:18,752 --> 01:54:20,032
It's a little more nuanced

1952
01:54:20,544 --> 01:54:21,824
In terms of like I don't think

1953
01:54:22,080 --> 01:54:24,384
Billionaire class or the

1954
01:54:24,896 --> 01:54:25,920
The super-wealthy

1955
01:54:26,176 --> 01:54:29,248
The oligarchs yes I don't think that they have a vested interest in

1956
01:54:29,504 --> 01:54:30,016
Killing us

1957
01:54:30,272 --> 01:54:30,784
Necessarily

1958
01:54:31,040 --> 01:54:33,856
It's just that if we do they don't care

1959
01:54:34,112 --> 01:54:36,160
And the things that Keep Us Alive

1960
01:54:36,416 --> 01:54:36,928
Them lots

1961
01:54:37,184 --> 01:54:37,696
Money

1962
01:54:37,952 --> 01:54:41,024
And they don't care about that they want to take away those things

1963
01:54:42,304 --> 01:54:43,072
To survive with

1964
01:54:43,584 --> 01:54:47,680
They're not mad about that cuz we still get to work and prop up the organization's

1965
01:54:47,936 --> 01:54:48,960
But they need

1966
01:54:49,216 --> 01:54:50,752
To make money

1967
01:54:51,264 --> 01:54:53,568
The difference between our version of

1968
01:54:53,824 --> 01:54:54,336
Boogeyman

1969
01:54:54,592 --> 01:54:56,128
Analysis version of Boogeyman

1970
01:54:56,384 --> 01:54:57,408
Our hours are real

1971
01:54:57,664 --> 01:55:03,040
And also we don't have these fictitious narratives about white genocide

1972
01:55:03,808 --> 01:55:04,320
Credit

1973
01:55:05,856 --> 01:55:06,368
Not

1974
01:55:06,624 --> 01:55:07,904
Engaging with this

1975
01:55:09,952 --> 01:55:12,768
Conversation

1976
01:55:13,280 --> 01:55:13,792
Because I know that

1977
01:55:17,376 --> 01:55:17,888
You say

1978
01:55:22,240 --> 01:55:27,616
Go go go go go go even more

1979
01:55:29,664 --> 01:55:35,808
I prefer it when you look into the camera and say that I'm the worst no-win for me

1980
01:55:36,832 --> 01:55:41,440
What your call

1981
01:55:41,696 --> 01:55:45,280
Sympathy

1982
01:55:46,048 --> 01:55:51,936
Will make your point a reasonable conversation

1983
01:55:52,192 --> 01:55:55,008
I do think that they are actively

1984
01:55:57,056 --> 01:55:57,568
You can make a good

1985
01:55:57,824 --> 01:56:01,408
I was just expressing my position

1986
01:56:02,688 --> 01:56:03,968
That's kind of

1987
01:56:05,760 --> 01:56:09,600
I think that is the fundamental difference we often have on

1988
01:56:09,856 --> 01:56:10,624
So many

1989
01:56:10,880 --> 01:56:12,160
Different things

1990
01:56:12,416 --> 01:56:12,928
Is

1991
01:56:14,208 --> 01:56:18,560
How much of it is murder versus how much of it is manslaughter

1992
01:56:19,328 --> 01:56:25,472
Rave I think that's the conversation we often wind up having

1993
01:56:25,728 --> 01:56:26,752
Sitting in it a little bit

1994
01:56:27,008 --> 01:56:27,520
I

1995
01:56:27,776 --> 01:56:28,544
Start to

1996
01:56:28,800 --> 01:56:30,848
I start to Distance by personal experience

1997
01:56:31,872 --> 01:56:33,152
But look at the bigger picture

1998
01:56:35,712 --> 01:56:40,064
The biggest the laissez-faire I don't give a fuk kind of attitude of

1999
01:56:40,320 --> 01:56:40,832
The rich

2000
01:56:41,600 --> 01:56:43,136
People

2001
01:56:43,648 --> 01:56:44,672
Survive others

2002
01:56:45,952 --> 01:56:47,744
And that might be a little bit of

2003
01:56:48,256 --> 01:56:49,536
Bias that I have

2004
01:56:50,304 --> 01:56:50,816
Privilege

2005
01:56:52,096 --> 01:56:54,656
Right lower on

2006
01:56:55,680 --> 01:56:56,448
It is

2007
01:56:57,216 --> 01:56:59,776
It is absolutely straight up

2008
01:57:00,032 --> 01:57:01,312
Them

2009
01:57:01,568 --> 01:57:03,104
I guess there's only a semantic.

2010
01:57:03,616 --> 01:57:04,128
Between

2011
01:57:04,384 --> 01:57:05,664
Wanting to kill you

2012
01:57:05,920 --> 01:57:07,200
Not caring if you

2013
01:57:07,712 --> 01:57:09,248
Right

2014
01:57:12,064 --> 01:57:13,856
Right if there's if it like

2015
01:57:14,624 --> 01:57:18,720
Regardless of whether or not there is an active desire to murder

2016
01:57:19,488 --> 01:57:21,024
You are murdering people

2017
01:57:21,280 --> 01:57:24,864
Yeah you are doing it with knowledge that people are going to die

2018
01:57:25,632 --> 01:57:28,704
Do you know what I'm saying for the sake of

2019
01:57:28,960 --> 01:57:29,472
Your

2020
01:57:30,240 --> 01:57:31,008
If you

2021
01:57:33,056 --> 01:57:34,848
We need to cut Medicaid

2022
01:57:35,104 --> 01:57:37,152
You are saying that from the position of

2023
01:57:37,408 --> 01:57:37,920
Yes

2024
01:57:38,176 --> 01:57:40,480
I know people will die because

2025
01:57:41,504 --> 01:57:42,784
I am saying

2026
01:57:43,296 --> 01:57:43,808
Regardless

2027
01:57:44,064 --> 01:57:46,624
The argument can never really be does medic

2028
01:57:48,160 --> 01:57:52,000
About this financial

2029
01:57:53,280 --> 01:57:53,792
Exactly

2030
01:57:54,048 --> 01:57:55,584
Can never be about what does this

2031
01:57:55,840 --> 01:57:56,352
Provide

2032
01:57:58,400 --> 01:57:59,168
Obamacare

2033
01:57:59,424 --> 01:57:59,936
Yeah

2034
01:58:00,192 --> 01:58:01,984
30 million more people are on in

2035
01:58:02,752 --> 01:58:05,056
We should get rid of those millions of people

2036
01:58:07,616 --> 01:58:08,640
People will die

2037
01:58:08,896 --> 01:58:09,408
Due to

2038
01:58:10,176 --> 01:58:11,712
But financially speaking

2039
01:58:11,968 --> 01:58:12,736
It makes sense

2040
01:58:12,992 --> 01:58:13,760
You don't like that kind

2041
01:58:14,016 --> 01:58:14,784
Situation

2042
01:58:15,296 --> 01:58:17,088
With that example the thing I would

2043
01:58:17,344 --> 01:58:18,112
I would set back to

2044
01:58:18,624 --> 01:58:19,136
Who is like

2045
01:58:20,160 --> 01:58:20,928
Then it's not nothing

2046
01:58:21,184 --> 01:58:22,208
Really killing

2047
01:58:22,464 --> 01:58:24,512
People as much as it is putting them into

2048
01:58:26,304 --> 01:58:26,816
Bonded

2049
01:58:27,072 --> 01:58:29,376
Putting them into wage slavery bondage

2050
01:58:29,632 --> 01:58:30,400
Deep death

2051
01:58:30,912 --> 01:58:33,472
And s*** like that which is right

2052
01:58:34,752 --> 01:58:35,520
But that's not

2053
01:58:35,776 --> 01:58:36,288
Killing them

2054
01:58:36,544 --> 01:58:38,080
It's more making them

2055
01:58:38,848 --> 01:58:39,360
Completely inert

2056
01:58:39,616 --> 01:58:40,128
Variables

2057
01:58:46,272 --> 01:58:48,064
I would much rather like

2058
01:58:49,600 --> 01:58:52,672
Directions to bed with Alec

2059
01:58:52,928 --> 01:58:54,208
Narratives about the people's at

2060
01:58:54,720 --> 01:58:55,232
We don't like

2061
01:58:55,744 --> 01:58:59,584
Yeah I'm not ready to call them and order all of us

2062
01:58:59,840 --> 01:59:00,352
Because

2063
01:59:00,608 --> 01:59:01,120
I don't want to

2064
01:59:01,376 --> 01:59:03,936
Radicalized the people who listen to

2065
01:59:04,192 --> 01:59:08,544
Like I do I respect the hell out of people listen

2066
01:59:08,800 --> 01:59:09,312
Come to us

2067
01:59:10,848 --> 01:59:11,616
WeChat

2068
01:59:11,872 --> 01:59:14,176
Interact

2069
01:59:14,432 --> 01:59:16,480
I don't want there to be a moment where

2070
01:59:16,992 --> 01:59:18,272
Like they get

2071
01:59:18,528 --> 01:59:23,904
Some sort of dumbass idea pizza shop

2072
01:59:24,672 --> 01:59:29,280
Sleep but at the same time

2073
01:59:29,536 --> 01:59:30,304
Did you not

2074
01:59:31,072 --> 01:59:37,216
Take that out of context you should go to the boardroom and s*** on

2075
01:59:37,472 --> 01:59:38,752
Table

2076
01:59:43,104 --> 01:59:44,384
I know where this episode

2077
01:59:44,640 --> 01:59:46,432
That's why I'm being very specific

2078
01:59:46,688 --> 01:59:48,480
Yes it is

2079
01:59:49,504 --> 01:59:50,272
I I don't

2080
01:59:51,040 --> 01:59:52,064
That our audience

2081
01:59:52,320 --> 01:59:52,832
Should

2082
01:59:54,368 --> 01:59:55,136
Think of

2083
01:59:55,392 --> 01:59:56,672
People

2084
01:59:57,184 --> 01:59:57,696
Who

2085
01:59:57,952 --> 01:59:58,720
Are in charge

2086
01:59:58,976 --> 02:00:00,256
Menards are really ruining

2087
02:00:02,304 --> 02:00:03,072
Demonic end

2088
02:00:03,584 --> 02:00:04,096
Want

2089
02:00:04,352 --> 02:00:04,864
Kill you

2090
02:00:05,376 --> 02:00:06,400
As much as they are

2091
02:00:06,656 --> 02:00:07,424
Very greedy

2092
02:00:08,448 --> 02:00:09,216
Right

2093
02:00:09,472 --> 02:00:10,752
It is about accumulation

2094
02:00:11,008 --> 02:00:11,520
Wealth

2095
02:00:12,800 --> 02:00:18,944
Cutting people out of the equation that's that's really more

2096
02:00:19,200 --> 02:00:19,968
Real world

2097
02:00:20,992 --> 02:00:21,504
Motive

2098
02:00:21,760 --> 02:00:24,832
That we've seen over and over again

2099
02:00:25,856 --> 02:00:29,440
Right we we see almost every time there's some sort of

2100
02:00:29,952 --> 02:00:32,256
Like really successful thing it's based on fraud

2101
02:00:33,792 --> 02:00:35,584
Within Market

2102
02:00:35,840 --> 02:00:39,424
Or nemean Ron type

2103
02:00:39,680 --> 02:00:41,984
What I see.

2104
02:00:42,496 --> 02:00:44,800
And I feel like this is probably

2105
02:00:45,056 --> 02:00:46,848
The most apt comparison that

2106
02:00:49,408 --> 02:00:50,432
These people like

2107
02:00:52,992 --> 02:00:54,784
You see somebody ride a horse to

2108
02:00:56,320 --> 02:00:56,832
You know

2109
02:01:00,416 --> 02:01:02,464
The horses simply away

2110
02:01:02,976 --> 02:01:05,280
A horse is simply the way to get the meme

2111
02:01:05,792 --> 02:01:08,352
Matters

2112
02:01:08,608 --> 02:01:10,144
Because whatever it is they think they're doing

2113
02:01:10,656 --> 02:01:11,424
Is more important

2114
02:01:11,680 --> 02:01:12,192
Then the life of

2115
02:01:12,704 --> 02:01:14,496
Now is

2116
02:01:14,752 --> 02:01:16,544
Is kant's categorical imperative

2117
02:01:17,056 --> 02:01:18,080
Yes to some extent

2118
02:01:18,336 --> 02:01:20,640
We're talkin about that

2119
02:01:21,152 --> 02:01:23,968
Want the only thing that is good in the world is a Goodwill

2120
02:01:24,224 --> 02:01:27,552
Ray only thing that is good is doing things for the right reason

2121
02:01:28,832 --> 02:01:32,160
And if you don't have your acting out of bad faith

2122
02:01:32,416 --> 02:01:34,464
Sinbad will than anything you do is bad

2123
02:01:34,720 --> 02:01:36,000
And I agreed

2124
02:01:38,816 --> 02:01:40,864
We've lost track of that to a certain

2125
02:01:41,120 --> 02:01:43,168
The other

2126
02:01:43,424 --> 02:01:44,192
Application from that

2127
02:01:44,448 --> 02:01:45,216
Leave it

2128
02:01:45,472 --> 02:01:45,984
I can't

2129
02:01:47,520 --> 02:01:48,032
Another philosopher

2130
02:01:48,288 --> 02:01:49,568
I apologize if that's okay

2131
02:01:50,080 --> 02:01:52,384
From I-80

2132
02:01:52,640 --> 02:01:53,664
Yeah once said

2133
02:01:53,920 --> 02:01:57,248
The idea of treating someone as a meme

2134
02:01:57,504 --> 02:01:59,808
To an end as opposed to an end in love

2135
02:02:00,064 --> 02:02:00,576
Themselves

2136
02:02:00,832 --> 02:02:01,600
Is always wrong

2137
02:02:02,112 --> 02:02:03,136
And I believe that is

2138
02:02:03,392 --> 02:02:04,672
I believe that is

2139
02:02:05,440 --> 02:02:07,232
If you'll just are treating someone

2140
02:02:07,488 --> 02:02:10,560
With their autonomy and their there an individual experience

2141
02:02:10,816 --> 02:02:11,840
As a means

2142
02:02:12,096 --> 02:02:13,376
Things to get you something

2143
02:02:13,888 --> 02:02:14,400
As opposed to

2144
02:02:14,656 --> 02:02:15,168
To being a human

2145
02:02:16,448 --> 02:02:17,216
Then you're f*****

2146
02:02:17,728 --> 02:02:21,056
The system that we live in right now does both

2147
02:02:21,312 --> 02:02:21,824
Of those

2148
02:02:22,080 --> 02:02:25,152
They are acting in bad will people as mean

2149
02:02:25,920 --> 02:02:28,480
Agree so there is a reason enough

2150
02:02:28,736 --> 02:02:29,504
They're too just

2151
02:02:29,760 --> 02:02:30,272
Be like

2152
02:02:30,784 --> 02:02:31,296
Burn It Down

2153
02:02:31,552 --> 02:02:32,064
Of course

2154
02:02:32,320 --> 02:02:34,368
The only question I have for you is Dan

2155
02:02:36,416 --> 02:02:37,440
Listen theologian

2156
02:02:37,696 --> 02:02:40,000
There's a lot of ideas

2157
02:02:40,512 --> 02:02:41,024
Coming out of

2158
02:02:43,072 --> 02:02:44,096
It is

2159
02:02:44,352 --> 02:02:46,400
It is the question of that

2160
02:02:46,912 --> 02:02:48,448
I keep going back to

2161
02:02:49,728 --> 02:02:51,264
When we started

2162
02:02:52,288 --> 02:02:53,568
The question cuz you're you

2163
02:02:54,080 --> 02:02:57,152
Yeah it was constantly to me always like

2164
02:02:57,408 --> 02:02:59,712
Is Alex stupid

2165
02:03:00,480 --> 02:03:03,808
And as we gone along the question has become

2166
02:03:04,832 --> 02:03:05,600
Does it matter

2167
02:03:06,112 --> 02:03:10,208
Doesn't matter if you are stupid.

2168
02:03:10,720 --> 02:03:14,048
Cuz because it is for me

2169
02:03:15,584 --> 02:03:16,608
888

2170
02:03:17,120 --> 02:03:18,400
More I know Alex

2171
02:03:19,168 --> 02:03:20,448
I know that right

2172
02:03:21,728 --> 02:03:23,264
It's more become to me

2173
02:03:24,288 --> 02:03:25,312
Does he know what he's

2174
02:03:26,080 --> 02:03:26,592
Right

2175
02:03:26,848 --> 02:03:32,736
So to you but that's the question of stupid versus evil if you're doing something stupid

2176
02:03:33,248 --> 02:03:36,064
Because you believe in it as a good thing I disagree

2177
02:03:36,320 --> 02:03:38,880
Okay I disagree because I've already established

2178
02:03:39,648 --> 02:03:40,672
I know that

2179
02:03:43,488 --> 02:03:44,768
Inaccurate readings

2180
02:03:45,024 --> 02:03:46,048
Attacks

2181
02:03:46,304 --> 02:03:51,424
Stupid whatever explanation you have for soup

2182
02:03:55,776 --> 02:04:01,920
In that we started with that stupid versus evil

2183
02:04:02,432 --> 02:04:04,480
Envy Evil part now is

2184
02:04:04,736 --> 02:04:05,760
Become evil

2185
02:04:06,016 --> 02:04:08,064
Knowingly and willingly

2186
02:04:08,320 --> 02:04:10,624
Or evil just incidentally

2187
02:04:11,136 --> 02:04:13,696
Right and that that part is still that's

2188
02:04:13,952 --> 02:04:15,232
Still tough for me I still

2189
02:04:15,488 --> 02:04:16,512
I don't have evidence

2190
02:04:17,024 --> 02:04:18,048
Bet he is

2191
02:04:19,072 --> 02:04:19,584
Full on

2192
02:04:19,840 --> 02:04:20,864
Honeyville

2193
02:04:21,120 --> 02:04:22,400
But I do have evidence

2194
02:04:23,680 --> 02:04:27,520
Presented it over and over and over to even in this episode of the Daria

2195
02:04:28,032 --> 02:04:30,080
Like

2196
02:04:30,336 --> 02:04:31,360
Do you have

2197
02:04:31,616 --> 02:04:32,640
Stop

2198
02:04:33,408 --> 02:04:35,968
Sorry you have to tell if your Russian agent

2199
02:04:36,224 --> 02:04:36,736
Keys

2200
02:04:37,248 --> 02:04:38,272
In service

2201
02:04:38,528 --> 02:04:39,552
Of negative things

2202
02:04:39,808 --> 02:04:40,832
Bright Eyes

2203
02:04:41,856 --> 02:04:42,368
But I

2204
02:04:42,880 --> 02:04:43,392
Don't know

2205
02:04:44,160 --> 02:04:45,952
Still don't know if it

2206
02:04:46,208 --> 02:04:46,976
Is evilness

2207
02:04:47,232 --> 02:04:47,744
I still don't

2208
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:49,024
Know if it goes past

2209
02:04:50,048 --> 02:04:51,072
Abject greed

2210
02:04:52,096 --> 02:04:53,120
Which is still evil

2211
02:04:53,376 --> 02:04:55,680
But it's not evil in the bigger sense

2212
02:04:55,936 --> 02:04:56,448
That like

2213
02:04:56,704 --> 02:04:57,984
Trying to bring down the key

2214
02:05:01,568 --> 02:05:02,592
That's the end

2215
02:05:05,408 --> 02:05:06,688
The way he does his rhetoric

2216
02:05:07,968 --> 02:05:08,480
Sebring

2217
02:05:08,736 --> 02:05:09,248
Narrative

2218
02:05:09,504 --> 02:05:10,016
The world

2219
02:05:10,272 --> 02:05:11,296
The end result

2220
02:05:11,552 --> 02:05:12,064
Will be

2221
02:05:12,832 --> 02:05:13,344
Apollo God

2222
02:05:13,856 --> 02:05:15,136
Probably

2223
02:05:15,392 --> 02:05:16,416
His desire

2224
02:05:16,928 --> 02:05:20,512
But his rhetoric

2225
02:05:20,768 --> 02:05:23,840
Bagel history

2226
02:05:24,096 --> 02:05:25,376
Will lead to

2227
02:05:25,632 --> 02:05:26,656
Disperse

2228
02:05:26,912 --> 02:05:29,472
Putting in camps

2229
02:05:30,752 --> 02:05:33,056
Will lead to a horse

2230
02:05:33,312 --> 02:05:35,872
Crackdown on people's liberal Sensibility

2231
02:05:37,920 --> 02:05:38,944
You put them in the oven

2232
02:05:39,200 --> 02:05:42,528
Not that much

2233
02:05:43,296 --> 02:05:44,320
Wiggle room

2234
02:05:44,832 --> 02:05:45,344
Course

2235
02:05:46,368 --> 02:05:46,880
But

2236
02:05:47,904 --> 02:05:48,672
I don't know why I'm trying

2237
02:05:51,744 --> 02:05:56,096
I think I think what I'm what I'm understanding of what you're you're discussing

2238
02:05:56,608 --> 02:05:57,120
Is

2239
02:05:57,376 --> 02:06:00,448
I think he's scared much

2240
02:06:01,216 --> 02:06:02,496
How much does motivation

2241
02:06:04,032 --> 02:06:05,056
Change your

2242
02:06:05,568 --> 02:06:06,080
Opinions on

2243
02:06:06,592 --> 02:06:07,104
To deal with

2244
02:06:07,616 --> 02:06:10,176
Now that was out at all

2245
02:06:10,432 --> 02:06:12,992
I deal with him objectively as

2246
02:06:13,248 --> 02:06:13,760
He says

2247
02:06:14,272 --> 02:06:16,320
And what I what I gather from

2248
02:06:16,832 --> 02:06:20,928
Researching the narratives and

2249
02:06:21,184 --> 02:06:21,696
I don't

2250
02:06:22,464 --> 02:06:23,232
I mean

2251
02:06:24,256 --> 02:06:25,280
Still give him credit for the

2252
02:06:25,536 --> 02:06:26,048
The things that he's

2253
02:06:26,304 --> 02:06:27,072
Right on

2254
02:06:27,328 --> 02:06:28,352
Not like we're not

2255
02:06:29,888 --> 02:06:30,400
Had to

2256
02:06:31,424 --> 02:06:31,936
True

2257
02:06:32,192 --> 02:06:33,216
Been a long while

2258
02:06:36,288 --> 02:06:37,312
Changing philosophic

2259
02:06:37,568 --> 02:06:38,080
Opposition

2260
02:06:38,336 --> 02:06:39,616
Has come from like

2261
02:06:40,128 --> 02:06:41,152
Well on the last step

2262
02:06:42,176 --> 02:06:43,712
A reason

2263
02:06:44,480 --> 02:06:45,248
I-PASS

2264
02:06:45,504 --> 02:06:46,016
The question

2265
02:06:47,040 --> 02:06:48,832
Can you say that the world would not

2266
02:06:49,088 --> 02:06:49,600
Bigger better play

2267
02:06:50,368 --> 02:06:51,392
If all Republic

2268
02:06:51,648 --> 02:06:52,160
Inside this

2269
02:06:52,928 --> 02:06:53,696
Right right

2270
02:06:54,208 --> 02:06:54,720
So

2271
02:06:54,976 --> 02:06:56,768
If you are if Alex is

2272
02:06:58,048 --> 02:06:58,560
Evil

2273
02:06:59,072 --> 02:07:00,096
Does it matter

2274
02:07:00,608 --> 02:07:02,400
The world would be better off without

2275
02:07:02,912 --> 02:07:04,448
We're not opening not a republic

2276
02:07:05,216 --> 02:07:06,496
But that's not that's not

2277
02:07:06,752 --> 02:07:08,544
The only reason

2278
02:07:08,800 --> 02:07:11,360
The only reason that that

2279
02:07:11,616 --> 02:07:13,920
Comes up in my mind is because

2280
02:07:14,944 --> 02:07:16,224
I say it

2281
02:07:16,736 --> 02:07:17,248
Like I don't want

2282
02:07:19,040 --> 02:07:23,392
I don't want our listeners killing expired as a thought experiment and so

2283
02:07:23,904 --> 02:07:24,928
If it is that thought

2284
02:07:26,720 --> 02:07:27,232
Does it matter

2285
02:07:28,256 --> 02:07:30,560
Does it matter what your motivation is

2286
02:07:31,072 --> 02:07:32,352
Behind what you're doing

2287
02:07:32,608 --> 02:07:33,888
The difference is

2288
02:07:34,144 --> 02:07:35,168
Murder vs.

2289
02:07:35,680 --> 02:07:38,240
Does it matter whether or not billionaires

2290
02:07:38,752 --> 02:07:40,032
Want to murder us

2291
02:07:40,288 --> 02:07:43,104
Or whether not billionaires support things that will kill

2292
02:07:43,616 --> 02:07:45,408
It doesn't matter to me

2293
02:07:45,664 --> 02:07:47,712
Because the issue is that we are going

2294
02:07:47,968 --> 02:07:50,016
Going to die

2295
02:07:50,272 --> 02:07:50,784
Feel about

2296
02:07:51,040 --> 02:07:56,416
I agree with you it and now the secondary problem becomes we have one political party

2297
02:07:57,440 --> 02:07:57,952
Supporting

2298
02:07:58,208 --> 02:07:59,488
What you're talkin about

2299
02:07:59,744 --> 02:08:01,536
Another political party

2300
02:08:01,792 --> 02:08:03,328
Not doing as good a job as

2301
02:08:03,584 --> 02:08:04,864
We need fighting against

2302
02:08:06,144 --> 02:08:07,168
And so we'll see what he

2303
02:08:07,936 --> 02:08:08,960
Anyway I don't know

2304
02:08:09,472 --> 02:08:12,288
I love this conversation but

2305
02:08:16,128 --> 02:08:16,640
Point

2306
02:08:16,896 --> 02:08:18,432
Let's get back to it

2307
02:08:18,944 --> 02:08:20,224
Riverside

2308
02:08:20,480 --> 02:08:23,552
We're having a classic knowledge by 12 and a half

2309
02:08:23,808 --> 02:08:24,320
Episode

2310
02:08:24,576 --> 02:08:27,136
It is not a money bomb because we are just

2311
02:08:27,392 --> 02:08:28,160
Capable of being

2312
02:08:28,416 --> 02:08:30,208
Quiet but seriously please donate

2313
02:08:33,280 --> 02:08:35,840
If you've made it this far

2314
02:08:36,352 --> 02:08:38,912
I do need help frankly if you made it this far

2315
02:08:39,168 --> 02:08:39,680
You owe us

2316
02:08:39,936 --> 02:08:42,240
I do need help

2317
02:08:42,496 --> 02:08:45,056
Yeah even just in terms of making rent this month

2318
02:08:45,568 --> 02:08:51,712
Need help so please donate to the show reason point.com

2319
02:08:51,968 --> 02:08:54,272
Calm.com

2320
02:08:54,784 --> 02:08:55,808
Anyway that's alright

2321
02:08:56,064 --> 02:08:58,368
It's weird how

2322
02:08:58,624 --> 02:09:00,416
We will produce a lot of

2323
02:09:02,208 --> 02:09:03,232
I think we would do it

2324
02:09:03,488 --> 02:09:04,512
Regardless of whether or not

2325
02:09:04,768 --> 02:09:05,280
Anybody gave us

2326
02:09:05,792 --> 02:09:06,560
I do it for nothing

2327
02:09:06,816 --> 02:09:09,376
Pretty nice

2328
02:09:09,632 --> 02:09:14,496
It would be nice if you became justifier weird obsession

2329
02:09:14,752 --> 02:09:15,776
Jordan

2330
02:09:16,032 --> 02:09:18,848
So now we get to the point of this episode where this would have been

2331
02:09:20,640 --> 02:09:22,432
Alex Jones I mentioned this earlier

2332
02:09:22,688 --> 02:09:23,200
He has

2333
02:09:23,712 --> 02:09:24,480
Something that he wants

2334
02:09:24,736 --> 02:09:26,016
What's to talk about

2335
02:09:26,272 --> 02:09:27,808
Yes he's been

2336
02:09:28,064 --> 02:09:29,856
Dancing around getting to it

2337
02:09:30,112 --> 02:09:33,696
Much like he keeps avoiding going to calls

2338
02:09:37,024 --> 02:09:39,584
I'm sorry I told you okay

2339
02:09:41,632 --> 02:09:42,144
He

2340
02:09:42,400 --> 02:09:44,960
Has a news story out of

2341
02:09:45,728 --> 02:09:46,240
Video come

2342
02:09:47,264 --> 02:09:47,776
Dutch TV

2343
02:09:48,544 --> 02:09:49,824
Already I believe

2344
02:09:50,592 --> 02:09:51,360
He talks about this

2345
02:09:51,872 --> 02:09:53,152
In the sense that it is

2346
02:09:53,408 --> 02:09:54,432
Creeping Nazism

2347
02:09:55,712 --> 02:09:56,992
Is the Dutch

2348
02:09:57,248 --> 02:09:57,760
Leah

2349
02:09:59,040 --> 02:10:00,832
I don't know how to do this exactly

2350
02:10:01,344 --> 02:10:02,624
I'm just going to play this clip

2351
02:10:03,136 --> 02:10:06,208
That involve some fake cry

2352
02:10:09,024 --> 02:10:11,328
The Austrian government having a suddenly

2353
02:10:11,584 --> 02:10:12,096
Far-right

2354
02:10:13,120 --> 02:10:14,144
No no

2355
02:10:14,400 --> 02:10:16,960
I don't even do that

2356
02:10:18,240 --> 02:10:19,520
He actually has

2357
02:10:19,776 --> 02:10:20,288
I'll just break it

2358
02:10:20,800 --> 02:10:22,336
He has a decent

2359
02:10:23,872 --> 02:10:24,384
Starting

2360
02:10:25,152 --> 02:10:27,968
Alright alright

2361
02:10:28,224 --> 02:10:29,504
He loses it passed

2362
02:10:31,040 --> 02:10:31,808
The point of analysis

2363
02:10:32,064 --> 02:10:35,648
But has a decent starting point

2364
02:10:35,904 --> 02:10:37,440
Is that there is a

2365
02:10:37,952 --> 02:10:38,976
Is a video clip

2366
02:10:40,768 --> 02:10:41,536
Spoiler alert

2367
02:10:41,792 --> 02:10:42,304
2060

2368
02:10:44,352 --> 02:10:45,632
But it's from

2369
02:10:45,888 --> 02:10:49,216
A documentary that what came out on Dutch television

2370
02:10:49,472 --> 02:10:50,240
Call Dad

2371
02:10:50,496 --> 02:10:52,032
The last Downer

2372
02:10:52,800 --> 02:10:55,104
Donner is a term that they use for Down syndrome

2373
02:10:55,616 --> 02:10:56,384
People with Down

2374
02:10:57,152 --> 02:10:59,968
Which that's not great but that's not a good time I don't like

2375
02:11:00,224 --> 02:11:00,992
But that's

2376
02:11:01,248 --> 02:11:01,760
The Dutch

2377
02:11:02,272 --> 02:11:03,552
I'm not dealing with Dutch

2378
02:11:03,808 --> 02:11:04,320
PC issue

2379
02:11:05,088 --> 02:11:05,600
That's not

2380
02:11:07,136 --> 02:11:13,280
No that's not that's not weird car claim

2381
02:11:13,536 --> 02:11:19,680
I'll be thrilled that you and I could find him

2382
02:11:19,936 --> 02:11:21,472
Combat in this world is Dutch

2383
02:11:21,728 --> 02:11:22,496
PC right

2384
02:11:22,752 --> 02:11:25,056
There was a documentary

2385
02:11:25,312 --> 02:11:27,104
I called the last Downer

2386
02:11:27,616 --> 02:11:28,640
What it was

2387
02:11:28,896 --> 02:11:30,688
Was a

2388
02:11:31,968 --> 02:11:32,992
Well but here's the thing

2389
02:11:36,576 --> 02:11:37,600
Hearing the words

2390
02:11:38,112 --> 02:11:38,880
The last Downer

2391
02:11:39,136 --> 02:11:40,416
Is that contacts

2392
02:11:40,672 --> 02:11:41,184
Not a huge fan

2393
02:11:41,952 --> 02:11:42,464
Continue

2394
02:11:42,720 --> 02:11:45,024
In the Netherlands a reading a synopsis

2395
02:11:45,280 --> 02:11:50,400
Set of this cuz I couldn't find the full version of it I tried really hard to find a full Verizon

2396
02:11:50,912 --> 02:11:56,544
And it's just not available on American internet

2397
02:11:56,800 --> 02:11:57,312
McConaughey

2398
02:11:57,568 --> 02:11:58,080
Tiptoes

2399
02:11:58,336 --> 02:12:03,968
And there's a there's a bunch of Louis Theroux documentaries I want to watch you can't find cuz if I don't live in English

2400
02:12:04,224 --> 02:12:05,248
Rat

2401
02:12:05,504 --> 02:12:06,016
It's not on

2402
02:12:06,272 --> 02:12:07,040
The American YouTube

2403
02:12:08,832 --> 02:12:09,344
Imperial

2404
02:12:10,112 --> 02:12:11,392
In the Netherlands a TV

2405
02:12:11,648 --> 02:12:13,696
Show revolving around the end

2406
02:12:13,952 --> 02:12:15,232
Syndrome was recently aired on Nash

2407
02:12:15,488 --> 02:12:16,000
Television

2408
02:12:16,512 --> 02:12:18,304
The series it was titled the last Downer

2409
02:12:18,560 --> 02:12:19,072
Explorer

2410
02:12:20,608 --> 02:12:21,888
If Down syndrome disappears

2411
02:12:22,400 --> 02:12:25,472
They talked about ethical social-psychological consequence

2412
02:12:25,728 --> 02:12:26,752
Does having a child with down

2413
02:12:27,776 --> 02:12:28,288
So

2414
02:12:28,544 --> 02:12:30,336
The proof really interesting

2415
02:12:31,616 --> 02:12:36,480
But you understand

2416
02:12:36,736 --> 02:12:38,016
In the synopsis

2417
02:12:38,528 --> 02:12:39,808
The first thing it says

2418
02:12:40,064 --> 02:12:42,624
It explored what Society loses

2419
02:12:43,136 --> 02:12:46,208
Executive Down syndrome

2420
02:12:46,720 --> 02:12:49,536
That's a very interesting documentary topic of like

2421
02:12:51,072 --> 02:12:53,632
And and what it is what it is really is

2422
02:12:55,424 --> 02:12:56,448
An exploration

2423
02:12:57,472 --> 02:13:00,544
How many of those neuro atypical

2424
02:13:00,800 --> 02:13:01,568
Situation

2425
02:13:02,080 --> 02:13:03,872
Actually wind-up contributing

2426
02:13:04,128 --> 02:13:07,712
Far more to society then what are what is Publix

2427
02:13:07,968 --> 02:13:08,736
Like

2428
02:13:09,248 --> 02:13:10,528
2 to what extent

2429
02:13:11,040 --> 02:13:13,856
And if you want you can go back to biblical tea

2430
02:13:14,624 --> 02:13:15,392
How many prophets

2431
02:13:15,648 --> 02:13:17,696
Were people who had

2432
02:13:17,952 --> 02:13:21,536
I thought I had seizures

2433
02:13:24,352 --> 02:13:25,120
At what point

2434
02:13:25,376 --> 02:13:27,424
Do you look back at the

2435
02:13:28,704 --> 02:13:29,216
Relative

2436
02:13:29,472 --> 02:13:31,008
Weirdos of History

2437
02:13:31,264 --> 02:13:32,032
Influence the way things

2438
02:13:32,288 --> 02:13:33,824
Friend not just

2439
02:13:34,080 --> 02:13:34,592
And not

2440
02:13:35,360 --> 02:13:35,872
Just go

2441
02:13:38,432 --> 02:13:40,480
Tracks with symptoms of what we call Mint

2442
02:13:40,736 --> 02:13:41,504
Mental illness

2443
02:13:41,760 --> 02:13:42,528
The right you know

2444
02:13:43,040 --> 02:13:43,552
Like

2445
02:13:43,808 --> 02:13:47,392
Who is a who is a medicine man but somebody

2446
02:13:48,928 --> 02:13:52,768
Juilliard

2447
02:13:53,280 --> 02:13:56,608
What is the sphere but somebody who has grand mal seizures

2448
02:13:57,120 --> 02:14:02,240
These are these are things that are difficult to wrestle with before we get into any of this

2449
02:14:03,264 --> 02:14:03,776
Treveri

2450
02:14:04,032 --> 02:14:06,336
Yeah I'm guessing that we're not going to be huge fans of what

2451
02:14:06,848 --> 02:14:07,616
Is not good at this

2452
02:14:07,872 --> 02:14:11,200
But I've known a couple people who are friends

2453
02:14:11,456 --> 02:14:12,736
Red Down syndrome

2454
02:14:14,528 --> 02:14:15,552
Who's that I took away from that

2455
02:14:18,368 --> 02:14:18,880
Babel

2456
02:14:21,184 --> 02:14:21,696
Their people

2457
02:14:23,232 --> 02:14:24,256
Yeah big-time

2458
02:14:24,512 --> 02:14:25,536
They're people yeah

2459
02:14:25,792 --> 02:14:26,304
With

2460
02:14:27,072 --> 02:14:27,584
Issues

2461
02:14:28,096 --> 02:14:29,120
But at the same time

2462
02:14:30,400 --> 02:14:33,472
The same experience of life that everyone else has

2463
02:14:33,728 --> 02:14:35,776
Things that I

2464
02:14:36,032 --> 02:14:37,056
This is going to come in

2465
02:14:37,824 --> 02:14:38,848
Commentary pretty harsh

2466
02:14:39,360 --> 02:14:40,896
One of the things that I

2467
02:14:41,152 --> 02:14:42,432
I know from

2468
02:14:42,944 --> 02:14:44,224
Knowing people with Down Syndrome

2469
02:14:45,760 --> 02:14:46,528
Sort of looking into

2470
02:14:46,784 --> 02:14:47,552
The things a little bit

2471
02:14:47,808 --> 02:14:50,368
One of the biggest issues that people with Down

2472
02:14:51,648 --> 02:14:53,952
Is the people look at them with the diminished

2473
02:14:54,720 --> 02:14:56,256
Yes they look at them

2474
02:14:56,512 --> 02:14:57,024
Infantilize

2475
02:14:57,280 --> 02:14:58,048
As they look at them as

2476
02:14:58,560 --> 02:14:59,072
Being these

2477
02:14:59,328 --> 02:15:03,168
Oh so awestruck see innocent whatever in that

2478
02:15:03,424 --> 02:15:05,728
That's not who they are they live their lives

2479
02:15:06,240 --> 02:15:07,520
And maybe have

2480
02:15:08,288 --> 02:15:10,336
Developmental disabilities

2481
02:15:10,848 --> 02:15:13,920
In learning motor function or whatever

2482
02:15:14,176 --> 02:15:15,456
But that's not that doesn't

2483
02:15:15,712 --> 02:15:19,296
Define zone or they just have a physical

2484
02:15:19,552 --> 02:15:20,064
Deformity

2485
02:15:21,856 --> 02:15:23,392
You can compare to

2486
02:15:23,648 --> 02:15:24,672
The idea of like

2487
02:15:25,440 --> 02:15:27,744
We're going to put somebody in vocational school to

2488
02:15:28,768 --> 02:15:29,280
Have lights

2489
02:15:29,792 --> 02:15:31,328
Right as opposed to

2490
02:15:31,840 --> 02:15:32,608
This is how you

2491
02:15:33,376 --> 02:15:34,144
No f****** but

2492
02:15:36,192 --> 02:15:39,520
So I don't know what the full documentary

2493
02:15:40,032 --> 02:15:40,544
Was about

2494
02:15:40,800 --> 02:15:42,848
Again I told you I can't find

2495
02:15:43,104 --> 02:15:43,616
Can't find

2496
02:15:43,872 --> 02:15:44,896
But I watched

2497
02:15:45,408 --> 02:15:46,176
Before

2498
02:15:46,688 --> 02:15:47,200
Then Alex

2499
02:15:48,480 --> 02:15:51,552
Because you can't find that and is Alex

2500
02:15:51,808 --> 02:15:55,904
A four-year-old ape started to circulate on right-wing blogs

2501
02:15:56,416 --> 02:15:56,928
Couple days

2502
02:15:58,208 --> 02:16:00,768
So Alex picked up on

2503
02:16:01,536 --> 02:16:03,840
But like I said this documentary came out in 26

2504
02:16:04,352 --> 02:16:05,632
Get over a year old

2505
02:16:05,888 --> 02:16:06,400
And

2506
02:16:06,912 --> 02:16:08,192
Even covered by the app

2507
02:16:09,216 --> 02:16:12,544
Right they just found this three-minute one-minute clip

2508
02:16:14,592 --> 02:16:16,384
3 +

2509
02:16:17,920 --> 02:16:19,712
Just decides he's going to launch off on his

2510
02:16:20,736 --> 02:16:23,552
His mare is about it when I when I say that he has a DC

2511
02:16:23,808 --> 02:16:24,576
Jumping-off point

2512
02:16:25,088 --> 02:16:26,368
Is that the idea

2513
02:16:27,392 --> 02:16:28,160
He's

2514
02:16:28,416 --> 02:16:29,696
Rallying against

2515
02:16:31,744 --> 02:16:32,768
Is reasonable to sell

2516
02:16:33,792 --> 02:16:35,072
The idea of

2517
02:16:36,096 --> 02:16:36,608
I don't know

2518
02:16:36,864 --> 02:16:42,240
I'm interested now in what smokers I need to defend myself

2519
02:16:42,496 --> 02:16:44,032
Because I said that

2520
02:16:44,288 --> 02:16:46,592
It's just that like

2521
02:16:47,360 --> 02:16:48,384
You get to a certain

2522
02:16:48,896 --> 02:16:49,408
Play Swift

2523
02:16:49,920 --> 02:16:50,432
Genetics

2524
02:16:51,712 --> 02:16:53,504
In utero genetic screening

2525
02:16:54,272 --> 02:16:57,088
Okay where you're able to tell the people have

2526
02:16:57,344 --> 02:16:57,856
Various

2527
02:16:58,112 --> 02:17:00,160
Diseases

2528
02:17:01,440 --> 02:17:01,952
Was that mean

2529
02:17:02,208 --> 02:17:05,024
It's a reference for Sunrise

2530
02:17:07,840 --> 02:17:08,352
Sunrise in sweater

2531
02:17:10,144 --> 02:17:13,216
Gattaca there's some of those issues

2532
02:17:13,472 --> 02:17:15,008
Where does it end

2533
02:17:18,080 --> 02:17:19,872
If you look into like

2534
02:17:20,128 --> 02:17:20,640
Genetic

2535
02:17:20,896 --> 02:17:21,664
Abnormalities

2536
02:17:21,920 --> 02:17:23,968
There's something

2537
02:17:24,992 --> 02:17:27,808
Our lives there are genetic mutations

2538
02:17:29,856 --> 02:17:30,368
Tree branch

2539
02:17:36,000 --> 02:17:37,792
It's super not all people in Kentucky

2540
02:17:38,048 --> 02:17:39,584
Family in Kentucky

2541
02:17:40,096 --> 02:17:40,608
Who's skin

2542
02:17:40,864 --> 02:17:42,912
Is blue but there are some

2543
02:17:43,680 --> 02:17:44,448
Things where

2544
02:17:44,960 --> 02:17:45,984
Through genetic mapping

2545
02:17:46,496 --> 02:17:47,264
And genetic editing

2546
02:17:47,520 --> 02:17:50,080
You could allow someone to have a real

2547
02:17:50,336 --> 02:17:51,104
Normal life

2548
02:17:51,360 --> 02:17:51,872
Supposed to have

2549
02:17:52,128 --> 02:17:54,432
Tree bark or whatever

2550
02:17:54,688 --> 02:17:55,712
Yeah I think that's

2551
02:17:55,968 --> 02:17:56,736
The positive thing

2552
02:17:57,504 --> 02:18:01,600
I don't necessarily think the idea of aborting anybody who has Down syndrome is

2553
02:18:01,856 --> 02:18:02,624
The positive thing

2554
02:18:03,136 --> 02:18:03,648
But

2555
02:18:03,904 --> 02:18:05,184
If there's a way to

2556
02:18:05,952 --> 02:18:06,976
Edit Gene

2557
02:18:07,232 --> 02:18:10,304
In such a way that we figure out this is what makes you

2558
02:18:10,560 --> 02:18:11,072
Have down

2559
02:18:12,352 --> 02:18:12,864
Right

2560
02:18:13,120 --> 02:18:15,168
Don't think that's a negative

2561
02:18:15,680 --> 02:18:17,728
Massive conversation that you and I can

2562
02:18:17,984 --> 02:18:20,032
Can have about that towards eugenic

2563
02:18:20,288 --> 02:18:23,872
And where Alex Jones jump

2564
02:18:24,128 --> 02:18:24,640
From the art

2565
02:18:24,896 --> 02:18:26,176
It's a discussion where it's like

2566
02:18:26,432 --> 02:18:27,200
This is

2567
02:18:27,456 --> 02:18:28,480
Going to lead to

2568
02:18:28,736 --> 02:18:29,760
You killing of the week

2569
02:18:30,784 --> 02:18:32,064
I agree with him

2570
02:18:32,576 --> 02:18:36,160
Application or the real world

2571
02:18:36,416 --> 02:18:41,024
That's the only thing I wanted to hear is the only opinion I have on you

2572
02:18:43,328 --> 02:18:43,840
If

2573
02:18:46,656 --> 02:18:47,936
We discover a gene

2574
02:18:48,960 --> 02:18:50,752
That makes you an a******

2575
02:18:51,520 --> 02:18:53,568
I will immediately be like

2576
02:18:53,824 --> 02:18:55,616
Oh we can fix that Gene

2577
02:18:55,872 --> 02:18:56,640
Eugenics is perfect

2578
02:18:56,896 --> 02:18:59,968
Alex already thinks that exist

2579
02:19:00,224 --> 02:19:01,760
Up until that point

2580
02:19:02,528 --> 02:19:06,368
There's a lot of variables going on that I don't want to start f****** around

2581
02:19:06,880 --> 02:19:09,952
But if we find a gene in Alex so

2582
02:19:10,464 --> 02:19:16,608
We decode allocational defiant we decode Alex

2583
02:19:16,864 --> 02:19:18,400
We decode his genome

2584
02:19:18,656 --> 02:19:21,728
I'm not too bad and it's not Alex

2585
02:19:21,984 --> 02:19:22,752
And it's not Alex

2586
02:19:23,264 --> 02:19:23,776
Is everybody

2587
02:19:24,032 --> 02:19:24,800
In that ilk

2588
02:19:25,056 --> 02:19:27,872
And there's just like if we just flipped the switch

2589
02:19:28,384 --> 02:19:29,152
Alex Jones

2590
02:19:29,408 --> 02:19:31,712
Is not an ass-whole from uptodown

2591
02:19:32,736 --> 02:19:36,576
I have a lot of come I have a lot of questions

2592
02:19:36,832 --> 02:19:37,344
And a lot of

2593
02:19:38,624 --> 02:19:41,696
And I'm far more

2594
02:19:41,952 --> 02:19:48,096
Interested in describing I think it's pretty scary that now especially because we're on the Vanguard a lot of a lot of this

2595
02:19:49,376 --> 02:19:50,400
You and I are

2596
02:19:50,656 --> 02:19:55,520
Are mentally a lot of stuff from our genetic

2597
02:19:55,776 --> 02:19:58,080
Button a lot of those things has made us

2598
02:19:58,336 --> 02:20:00,640
The people that we are

2599
02:20:00,896 --> 02:20:03,968
Threatening on some way the idea of editing

2600
02:20:04,480 --> 02:20:10,624
And I wouldn't be the person that I am today at the same time if I was someone who who

2601
02:20:10,880 --> 02:20:12,160
Genetic

2602
02:20:12,416 --> 02:20:13,440
Condition that was

2603
02:20:13,696 --> 02:20:14,976
Painful all the time

2604
02:20:15,232 --> 02:20:17,280
And I lived a life that was just

2605
02:20:17,536 --> 02:20:19,840
Pain yeah I absolutely would be like

2606
02:20:20,608 --> 02:20:22,144
I really wish them all the attitude

2607
02:20:22,400 --> 02:20:26,752
Yeah my personality is not worth the fact that I've lived 10 years

2608
02:20:27,008 --> 02:20:28,544
15 years of just

2609
02:20:28,800 --> 02:20:30,080
Pain right died young

2610
02:20:30,336 --> 02:20:31,104
Well in the

2611
02:20:31,360 --> 02:20:32,128
The simplest

2612
02:20:32,384 --> 02:20:32,896
Waze

2613
02:20:33,152 --> 02:20:34,176
For me to relate to that

2614
02:20:34,688 --> 02:20:40,832
Is I do not talk about people with Down Syndrome I'm saying that about just genetic

2615
02:20:41,088 --> 02:20:42,112
Conditions.

2616
02:20:44,672 --> 02:20:45,696
Since I've been married

2617
02:20:46,464 --> 02:20:48,256
There will never

2618
02:20:48,768 --> 02:20:50,048
Be a day where I don't

2619
02:20:50,304 --> 02:20:50,816
Question

2620
02:20:52,096 --> 02:20:53,120
Would I be more

2621
02:20:53,376 --> 02:20:53,888
Creative

2622
02:20:54,144 --> 02:20:54,656
Right

2623
02:20:54,912 --> 02:20:56,192
If I were on medic

2624
02:20:57,216 --> 02:20:57,984
That's just

2625
02:20:58,240 --> 02:21:03,104
Har.com person is just like

2626
02:21:03,872 --> 02:21:06,688
What extent can I say that

2627
02:21:06,944 --> 02:21:07,712
My creativity

2628
02:21:09,504 --> 02:21:10,528
From my brain

2629
02:21:10,784 --> 02:21:12,320
Or from my brain

2630
02:21:13,088 --> 02:21:13,600
Brokenness

2631
02:21:14,624 --> 02:21:18,976
It's impossible to unpack exactly

2632
02:21:19,488 --> 02:21:24,096
So the idea of once again go back to what is this year but somebody with

2633
02:21:24,864 --> 02:21:27,168
What is

2634
02:21:27,680 --> 02:21:29,472
So if you edit that out

2635
02:21:31,008 --> 02:21:35,616
I honestly think

2636
02:21:35,872 --> 02:21:41,248
Who wrote diversity is important as neurotypical is their diversity is amazing

2637
02:21:41,760 --> 02:21:46,112
I don't know I can't speak to this cuz I can't find the entire documentary

2638
02:21:46,368 --> 02:21:49,952
I almost guarantee that that is kind of part of the point

2639
02:21:50,208 --> 02:21:55,072
Because

2640
02:21:55,328 --> 02:21:56,096
Mountain

2641
02:21:56,352 --> 02:22:01,216
But also why would the write-up of documentary be

2642
02:22:01,472 --> 02:22:03,520
What Society Lewis's

2643
02:22:03,776 --> 02:22:09,408
As if I would that be the first thing that's brought up in the house

2644
02:22:10,176 --> 02:22:11,712
Asthma

2645
02:22:11,968 --> 02:22:14,016
Hey what do we lose if we get rid of these guys

2646
02:22:14,272 --> 02:22:15,296
You know that.

2647
02:22:15,552 --> 02:22:21,184
Exact dark sartorial Center

2648
02:22:21,440 --> 02:22:24,768
They're notorious for their write-up for the TV program

2649
02:22:25,024 --> 02:22:31,168
Being dark sarcastic like a Steely Dan album

2650
02:22:31,424 --> 02:22:34,240
Are the mountain goats absolutely

2651
02:22:34,752 --> 02:22:37,568
So I left this first clip Alex Jones

2652
02:22:38,080 --> 02:22:39,616
Can't f****** handle getting to

2653
02:22:39,872 --> 02:22:41,408
2 talkin about the actual clip

2654
02:22:41,920 --> 02:22:42,944
I will see how he had

2655
02:22:43,200 --> 02:22:43,712
Course

2656
02:22:44,480 --> 02:22:46,016
Your phone calls

2657
02:22:46,272 --> 02:22:49,088
I need to because I got to put the clip for pull watching comes on

2658
02:22:50,112 --> 02:22:54,464
I washed it this morning

2659
02:22:54,720 --> 02:22:56,768
I couldn't sleep I got up

2660
02:22:57,280 --> 02:22:58,816
I want to be very clear

2661
02:22:59,584 --> 02:23:05,728
Oh he's going to fake cry

2662
02:23:05,984 --> 02:23:08,032
I wish that I had a Supercut of all the time

2663
02:23:08,544 --> 02:23:09,568
Teases getting to this

2664
02:23:09,824 --> 02:23:11,104
Throughout the show

2665
02:23:11,360 --> 02:23:12,640
I ain't just never does

2666
02:23:12,896 --> 02:23:15,200
This is like right when Paul Joseph Watson

2667
02:23:15,456 --> 02:23:16,480
Like takeover

2668
02:23:16,736 --> 02:23:18,272
We're getting close to the fourth hour

2669
02:23:20,320 --> 02:23:22,112
If I can do it I've been teasing at all show

2670
02:23:23,392 --> 02:23:27,232
And I went online I was looking to stuff and I saw this fat with the Dutch government in

2671
02:23:30,560 --> 02:23:32,608
Feel it wasn't put up by the Dutch government

2672
02:23:35,936 --> 02:23:40,544
It's so sick that I don't feel like I'm worthy even describe

2673
02:23:43,360 --> 02:23:44,128
Not sure that tracks

2674
02:23:44,384 --> 02:23:45,152
Just I don't

2675
02:23:45,664 --> 02:23:48,224
I don't

2676
02:23:48,736 --> 02:23:51,040
Sweet soft bureaucrat

2677
02:23:51,296 --> 02:23:52,320
Getting off

2678
02:23:52,576 --> 02:23:53,856
On making a

2679
02:23:54,112 --> 02:23:58,208
Down syndrome and feel bad and feel worthless like you should die

2680
02:23:58,976 --> 02:24:01,792
Cute scene fake liberal

2681
02:24:02,048 --> 02:24:06,400
Feminine email

2682
02:24:06,912 --> 02:24:09,728
Uber back to back

2683
02:24:10,240 --> 02:24:11,776
Even even him

2684
02:24:12,544 --> 02:24:14,080
Trying to defend

2685
02:24:15,872 --> 02:24:16,896
Exploitation

2686
02:24:17,152 --> 02:24:17,920
People with Down

2687
02:24:18,176 --> 02:24:19,712
Syndrome

2688
02:24:19,968 --> 02:24:20,480
Sounds like

2689
02:24:22,528 --> 02:24:26,368
Avoiding people with very aggressive

2690
02:24:26,880 --> 02:24:30,976
I realize this now. You guys don't have the video

2691
02:24:32,000 --> 02:24:33,024
We just talked about what

2692
02:24:33,536 --> 02:24:35,072
There's a guy with Down Syndrome

2693
02:24:35,328 --> 02:24:38,144
I am a guy who seems to be the host of

2694
02:24:38,400 --> 02:24:38,912
The show

2695
02:24:40,192 --> 02:24:41,728
The show is a smelt

2696
02:24:42,240 --> 02:24:48,384
Looking gentleman the only clip that Alex plays

2697
02:24:49,664 --> 02:24:51,200
Disseminated through right-wing blog

2698
02:24:52,480 --> 02:24:53,760
8 disc

2699
02:24:54,272 --> 02:24:55,552
Melt

2700
02:24:55,808 --> 02:24:57,088
Looking cool

2701
02:24:57,344 --> 02:24:58,880
Alex describes him as liberal live

2702
02:24:59,136 --> 02:24:59,648
Have no evidence

2703
02:25:01,440 --> 02:25:02,208
The guy with

2704
02:25:02,464 --> 02:25:03,232
Down syndrome

2705
02:25:07,328 --> 02:25:08,096
The scientist

2706
02:25:08,608 --> 02:25:10,400
Explaining to them how

2707
02:25:10,656 --> 02:25:12,448
Much it cost for society

2708
02:25:12,960 --> 02:25:13,472
To care

2709
02:25:13,728 --> 02:25:14,752
Do people with Down

2710
02:25:15,264 --> 02:25:16,544
As opposed to people

2711
02:25:17,824 --> 02:25:23,200
Entire setup

2712
02:25:23,456 --> 02:25:25,504
Purely economic term

2713
02:25:25,760 --> 02:25:27,552
Well in this mall close

2714
02:25:27,808 --> 02:25:32,160
Like this conversation is occurring

2715
02:25:32,672 --> 02:25:34,720
Purely within the realm of

2716
02:25:35,232 --> 02:25:36,512
The documentary having

2717
02:25:36,768 --> 02:25:42,912
The idea of the documentary is like an hour-long three minutes of it

2718
02:25:44,704 --> 02:25:45,984
If your documentary says

2719
02:25:46,240 --> 02:25:47,008
What do we have

2720
02:25:47,264 --> 02:25:47,776
Toulouse

2721
02:25:48,288 --> 02:25:50,080
By getting rid of people with Down

2722
02:25:50,592 --> 02:25:51,872
Bright you have

2723
02:25:52,128 --> 02:25:52,896
One Clip

2724
02:25:53,152 --> 02:25:54,176
That is based on an

2725
02:25:54,432 --> 02:25:54,944
Economic

2726
02:25:55,200 --> 02:25:55,712
Argument

2727
02:25:55,968 --> 02:25:57,760
Then it stands to reason

2728
02:25:58,272 --> 02:26:00,320
That much of the rest of the day

2729
02:26:01,856 --> 02:26:02,624
Isabel

2730
02:26:02,880 --> 02:26:03,392
Humana

2731
02:26:03,904 --> 02:26:07,744
I would assume so I mean like I know I've watched

2732
02:26:08,000 --> 02:26:08,512
Tons of

2733
02:26:09,024 --> 02:26:11,072
Documentaries about people

2734
02:26:13,632 --> 02:26:16,192
Various conditions

2735
02:26:16,960 --> 02:26:19,008
Being a Down syndrome one of them

2736
02:26:19,264 --> 02:26:22,848
Right always Delights me so much

2737
02:26:23,360 --> 02:26:24,896
Is them being like

2738
02:26:25,408 --> 02:26:29,248
Stop treating me like I'm a dick

2739
02:26:30,528 --> 02:26:31,808
Do I always love

2740
02:26:32,320 --> 02:26:36,160
People having that soft bigotry of diminished expectations

2741
02:26:36,672 --> 02:26:37,440
Thrown in there

2742
02:26:37,696 --> 02:26:40,256
Face yes I always love it when I speak

2743
02:26:40,512 --> 02:26:43,072
Someone talk to someone with Down Syndrome be like

2744
02:26:43,328 --> 02:26:44,608
How old are you

2745
02:26:44,864 --> 02:26:48,960
Fukkk offf they recognize when they're being f*****

2746
02:26:49,216 --> 02:26:50,752
And this guy

2747
02:26:51,008 --> 02:26:56,128
Neurotribes

2748
02:26:56,384 --> 02:26:56,896
Fantastic

2749
02:26:57,152 --> 02:26:59,712
Very very good the guy in the documentary

2750
02:26:59,968 --> 02:27:03,040
2 is clearly taking in the information that's been

2751
02:27:04,320 --> 02:27:07,136
Clearly part of the conversation he's not being like

2752
02:27:07,392 --> 02:27:12,512
He's not treated like a dick they're not saying we should kill you or anything like that

2753
02:27:12,768 --> 02:27:16,352
I realize that I had to lay sort of a scene of what the visual is

2754
02:27:16,608 --> 02:27:18,656
Totally get out so now let's get back to

2755
02:27:21,728 --> 02:27:22,752
Better his mine

2756
02:27:25,312 --> 02:27:29,408
Those people

2757
02:27:33,760 --> 02:27:39,904
Open Facebook

2758
02:27:41,952 --> 02:27:44,768
Call

2759
02:27:51,936 --> 02:27:55,008
Everything I'm talking about I'm so tired of it

2760
02:27:58,592 --> 02:27:59,360
Alex

2761
02:27:59,616 --> 02:28:01,920
Is doing good

2762
02:28:02,176 --> 02:28:04,224
Infantilizing of people with Down Syndrome

2763
02:28:04,480 --> 02:28:06,016
He's deep into that

2764
02:28:08,576 --> 02:28:11,648
They're giving him information that is just

2765
02:28:15,232 --> 02:28:16,000
To carry people

2766
02:28:16,512 --> 02:28:18,560
With the need for help

2767
02:28:19,072 --> 02:28:20,608
And that's not wrong

2768
02:28:23,680 --> 02:28:24,192
What

2769
02:28:24,704 --> 02:28:25,472
What is such a

2770
02:28:25,728 --> 02:28:26,240
Beer

2771
02:28:26,752 --> 02:28:27,520
Interview on the road

2772
02:28:29,312 --> 02:28:30,080
Which is that

2773
02:28:30,848 --> 02:28:32,128
And the way he's describing it

2774
02:28:32,640 --> 02:28:33,664
The Down Syndrome

2775
02:28:34,176 --> 02:28:35,712
Whoever whomever he may be

2776
02:28:36,480 --> 02:28:37,504
Doesn't matter

2777
02:28:38,784 --> 02:28:39,552
Bing

2778
02:28:40,064 --> 02:28:40,832
He is

2779
02:28:41,344 --> 02:28:41,856
Simple

2780
02:28:42,368 --> 02:28:45,184
He does not have a complex view as the world

2781
02:28:45,696 --> 02:28:46,464
And that's

2782
02:28:46,720 --> 02:28:50,304
The point virtue of not knowing

2783
02:28:52,608 --> 02:28:53,632
That is seeing God

2784
02:28:54,144 --> 02:28:54,912
Globalist

2785
02:28:55,936 --> 02:28:56,960
The scientist

2786
02:28:57,472 --> 02:28:59,776
The person the person who

2787
02:29:00,032 --> 02:29:01,312
Who describes this as a

2788
02:29:01,568 --> 02:29:02,592
The complex situation

2789
02:29:02,848 --> 02:29:03,616
Wherein he says

2790
02:29:03,872 --> 02:29:08,224
Okay well their relative positive negative we have to account

2791
02:29:08,480 --> 02:29:09,248
This week

2792
02:29:09,504 --> 02:29:10,016
Account for that

2793
02:29:10,272 --> 02:29:12,832
The important part is figuring out what it is

2794
02:29:14,880 --> 02:29:16,928
I would imagine in the documentary

2795
02:29:17,184 --> 02:29:18,976
Different scientists

2796
02:29:19,232 --> 02:29:22,304
Genomic scientists and then they go to

2797
02:29:22,560 --> 02:29:27,936
Regardless of that that's something that if you are a scientist

2798
02:29:28,192 --> 02:29:28,704
Consider

2799
02:29:29,728 --> 02:29:31,264
No matter how

2800
02:29:32,032 --> 02:29:32,544
Look

2801
02:29:33,568 --> 02:29:35,104
As far as the tax bill

2802
02:29:36,128 --> 02:29:37,920
Right when we discuss that

2803
02:29:38,688 --> 02:29:40,480
The the things that I

2804
02:29:40,736 --> 02:29:41,760
Consider constant

2805
02:29:42,272 --> 02:29:42,784
Is

2806
02:29:43,040 --> 02:29:44,320
The idea of

2807
02:29:44,576 --> 02:29:45,344
The point of this

2808
02:29:45,856 --> 02:29:46,624
Is 2

2809
02:29:46,880 --> 02:29:47,904
Destroy entitlement

2810
02:29:49,696 --> 02:29:50,720
To destroy socialism

2811
02:29:50,976 --> 02:29:51,488
Security to the

2812
02:29:51,744 --> 02:29:57,120
Destroy metal right

2813
02:29:57,376 --> 02:29:57,888
Now

2814
02:29:58,400 --> 02:30:00,448
I have to ask myself the question then

2815
02:30:01,984 --> 02:30:03,776
Is that bad for me

2816
02:30:05,056 --> 02:30:06,080
Like get rid of Medicare

2817
02:30:06,336 --> 02:30:09,152
Get rid of Social Security get rid of Medicare

2818
02:30:09,408 --> 02:30:10,176
I am

2819
02:30:11,968 --> 02:30:18,112
And who is social security who is covered by Medicare who is covered by Medicaid

2820
02:30:18,368 --> 02:30:20,928
Anyone else minorities elderly

2821
02:30:21,184 --> 02:30:21,696
Elderly

2822
02:30:22,208 --> 02:30:22,976
Is it

2823
02:30:23,232 --> 02:30:25,024
Is it then a good idea

2824
02:30:26,048 --> 02:30:31,168
Tuesday that the elderly should take my money and order to just continue living

2825
02:30:31,424 --> 02:30:33,216
Well

2826
02:30:33,472 --> 02:30:39,616
Like if you go my

2827
02:30:41,152 --> 02:30:43,968
If you are at all reasonable

2828
02:30:44,224 --> 02:30:50,368
You get into f*****-up territory and you think about

2829
02:30:50,624 --> 02:30:53,696
Thinking about it gif

2830
02:30:53,952 --> 02:30:57,792
It's because he's arguing that when socialism comes around

2831
02:30:58,304 --> 02:31:01,632
Just are going to be able to be like now you're too much of a burden

2832
02:31:02,144 --> 02:31:04,192
Burgerkill you or whatever

2833
02:31:05,216 --> 02:31:06,496
I know what's going to happen with capital

2834
02:31:09,568 --> 02:31:12,896
Absolute direction that their tax bills

2835
02:31:13,152 --> 02:31:14,176
Right you are not going to

2836
02:31:15,712 --> 02:31:20,832
I at the end probably won't be hurt by it either I had enough of it

2837
02:31:21,088 --> 02:31:22,880
Right it's not really

2838
02:31:25,696 --> 02:31:26,976
Are the people that Alex

2839
02:31:27,232 --> 02:31:27,744
Pretend

2840
02:31:28,000 --> 02:31:29,792
Are going to be the victims of

2841
02:31:30,304 --> 02:31:35,680
The Socialist take over much of a burden on society

2842
02:31:35,936 --> 02:31:37,984
Nothing like I think I think

2843
02:31:38,240 --> 02:31:41,056
Based on everything I have experienced

2844
02:31:41,312 --> 02:31:42,336
The people on the left

2845
02:31:44,128 --> 02:31:45,408
Easy to paint with a broad brush

2846
02:31:46,688 --> 02:31:47,200
People on the left

2847
02:31:47,456 --> 02:31:47,968
Gives a s***

2848
02:31:48,224 --> 02:31:51,040
But generally the people that I have mad on the left

2849
02:31:51,552 --> 02:31:52,064
And within

2850
02:31:53,088 --> 02:31:53,600
Some

2851
02:31:53,856 --> 02:31:54,368
Some socialist

2852
02:31:54,624 --> 02:31:55,136
Spoke

2853
02:31:55,648 --> 02:31:56,928
Have no interested

2854
02:31:58,208 --> 02:31:59,232
Getting rid of

2855
02:32:00,256 --> 02:32:00,768
Bouncing

2856
02:32:02,304 --> 02:32:02,816
People with Down

2857
02:32:03,328 --> 02:32:04,608
That is not like

2858
02:32:04,864 --> 02:32:06,144
That's not on their agenda

2859
02:32:06,912 --> 02:32:08,960
Just because they're more expensive

2860
02:32:09,216 --> 02:32:09,728
2

2861
02:32:10,752 --> 02:32:12,288
Having survived

2862
02:32:12,544 --> 02:32:13,312
Doesn't mean like

2863
02:32:13,568 --> 02:32:14,080
Kill them

2864
02:32:14,336 --> 02:32:15,104
I think

2865
02:32:20,224 --> 02:32:23,296
Yes it's applying account

2866
02:32:23,552 --> 02:32:24,576
I think

2867
02:32:25,600 --> 02:32:26,880
Capitalist mentality

2868
02:32:27,392 --> 02:32:27,904
Towards

2869
02:32:28,160 --> 02:32:29,440
Democratic

2870
02:32:30,208 --> 02:32:30,976
I think it's

2871
02:32:31,232 --> 02:32:32,768
Applying this mentality of like

2872
02:32:33,280 --> 02:32:35,584
You are too expensive you must go

2873
02:32:35,840 --> 02:32:39,424
Right that's a capitalist mentality

2874
02:32:39,936 --> 02:32:41,472
Taking care of everybody

2875
02:32:41,728 --> 02:32:42,752
And that is what

2876
02:32:43,008 --> 02:32:43,776
I think we should be working

2877
02:32:46,336 --> 02:32:47,616
I think my

2878
02:32:47,872 --> 02:32:49,920
Scoreboard

2879
02:32:50,176 --> 02:32:52,480
I think that's kind of more

2880
02:32:52,736 --> 02:32:53,504
Sesto is

2881
02:32:53,760 --> 02:32:54,528
At the same time

2882
02:32:55,296 --> 02:32:56,576
If you are not

2883
02:32:56,832 --> 02:32:57,344
Capable of

2884
02:32:57,856 --> 02:32:58,624
Tutoring like

2885
02:32:58,880 --> 02:33:01,440
The idea that I am aware

2886
02:33:01,952 --> 02:33:02,464
That

2887
02:33:02,976 --> 02:33:03,744
Medicaid

2888
02:33:04,000 --> 02:33:04,768
Medicare

2889
02:33:05,536 --> 02:33:06,048
Security

2890
02:33:06,304 --> 02:33:07,072
Not only do not

2891
02:33:07,328 --> 02:33:08,352
Benefit

2892
02:33:08,864 --> 02:33:10,144
But in many cases

2893
02:33:10,912 --> 02:33:12,960
Contribute to me having less money

2894
02:33:13,472 --> 02:33:15,008
And yet at the same time

2895
02:33:15,520 --> 02:33:16,544
I'm still capable of

2896
02:33:16,800 --> 02:33:20,384
Recognizing how they are far more beneficial to society

2897
02:33:20,640 --> 02:33:23,200
Aeropostale

2898
02:33:24,224 --> 02:33:26,016
Allows me to

2899
02:33:26,528 --> 02:33:27,808
Converse with both ideas

2900
02:33:28,320 --> 02:33:30,368
I think we're going to get to what Alex

2901
02:33:31,136 --> 02:33:32,160
Is mad about about

2902
02:33:32,416 --> 02:33:33,696
That here in a little bit

2903
02:33:33,952 --> 02:33:36,256
He doesn't want to be a part of society

2904
02:33:37,024 --> 02:33:41,632
But

2905
02:33:41,888 --> 02:33:44,192
Is that there is an idea of

2906
02:33:46,240 --> 02:33:47,264
Maybe at like

2907
02:33:48,288 --> 02:33:48,800
Legit

2908
02:33:49,056 --> 02:33:50,592
It's without question

2909
02:33:50,848 --> 02:33:56,992
And if you go by if I go by everything that directly benefit

2910
02:33:58,016 --> 02:34:00,320
Like 100% directly benefits

2911
02:34:00,576 --> 02:34:01,088
It's me

2912
02:34:01,856 --> 02:34:03,392
I should be a republican right

2913
02:34:03,904 --> 02:34:10,048
Like I'm a straight white dude I am within the ages of 18 to 34

2914
02:34:12,864 --> 02:34:15,680
Like all of that or sexually engaged

2915
02:34:15,936 --> 02:34:21,056
All of the stuff that they do not engaged

2916
02:34:21,312 --> 02:34:22,848
In all respects

2917
02:34:23,616 --> 02:34:25,664
What their policies do is affecting

2918
02:34:25,920 --> 02:34:27,200
Current temp

2919
02:34:27,712 --> 02:34:31,296
Yeah and if I was dumb I would say that's the best way to go

2920
02:34:32,064 --> 02:34:34,880
The reality is that in the larger

2921
02:34:35,136 --> 02:34:35,904
Summer things

2922
02:34:36,672 --> 02:34:37,440
That is a

2923
02:34:37,952 --> 02:34:39,232
Nonexistent possess

2924
02:34:39,744 --> 02:34:43,072
That will only benefit me for the next 5 years in minutes

2925
02:34:43,328 --> 02:34:44,864
Going to f****** over like everybody else

2926
02:34:45,632 --> 02:34:46,144
Like that

2927
02:34:46,400 --> 02:34:51,520
That's my biggest issue I might not just talk over everybody else that works

2928
02:34:51,776 --> 02:34:53,568
Exactly

2929
02:34:53,824 --> 02:34:56,384
It's but you still personally

2930
02:34:58,176 --> 02:34:59,200
A little bit

2931
02:35:03,808 --> 02:35:08,672
It goes trickle down economics

2932
02:35:08,928 --> 02:35:09,440
Somehow doesn't make

2933
02:35:10,464 --> 02:35:10,976
Alright fine

2934
02:35:12,000 --> 02:35:13,280
Your idea of

2935
02:35:14,304 --> 02:35:16,352
You want to make money as a business right

2936
02:35:17,120 --> 02:35:17,632
So

2937
02:35:18,656 --> 02:35:20,192
If you produce something

2938
02:35:20,704 --> 02:35:21,472
You want people to buy

2939
02:35:22,752 --> 02:35:24,544
At the same time you want profit on what you

2940
02:35:25,568 --> 02:35:26,336
So you reduce your

2941
02:35:26,848 --> 02:35:27,360
Is right

2942
02:35:27,616 --> 02:35:30,688
That one's up meaning that the people who buy it don't have as much

2943
02:35:31,456 --> 02:35:33,504
So the people who buy it don't have as much money

2944
02:35:33,760 --> 02:35:35,040
And I can't buy it anymore

2945
02:35:35,296 --> 02:35:37,344
So destroys you but in the short-term

2946
02:35:37,600 --> 02:35:38,624
You get a lot more money

2947
02:35:39,392 --> 02:35:41,952
If you get a lot of people

2948
02:35:42,208 --> 02:35:44,768
To have more money it's the difference between wealth and income

2949
02:35:45,792 --> 02:35:46,304
Wealth

2950
02:35:46,560 --> 02:35:47,072
Is

2951
02:35:47,328 --> 02:35:48,096
Destructive

2952
02:35:48,608 --> 02:35:50,144
Income is fantastic

2953
02:35:51,680 --> 02:35:55,520
If you're working late everybody

2954
02:35:55,776 --> 02:35:57,056
If you increase wealth

2955
02:35:57,312 --> 02:35:58,336
A few people

2956
02:35:59,872 --> 02:36:04,992
And that's what that's what the question with disconnect

2957
02:36:05,248 --> 02:36:06,016
Is about as well

2958
02:36:06,272 --> 02:36:07,296
Sure

2959
02:36:07,552 --> 02:36:08,320
If you

2960
02:36:08,576 --> 02:36:10,880
Increase

2961
02:36:12,160 --> 02:36:14,976
There's a very clear parallel between the two and it frustrates me

2962
02:36:15,744 --> 02:36:18,048
Because it's a short-sighted view of things

2963
02:36:18,560 --> 02:36:19,840
Anything that it doesn't exist

2964
02:36:23,168 --> 02:36:24,192
Edit someone's G

2965
02:36:24,704 --> 02:36:27,520
When you know that they are going to be

2966
02:36:28,032 --> 02:36:28,544
Right

2967
02:36:28,800 --> 02:36:30,848
And make it so they don't have down

2968
02:36:32,384 --> 02:36:32,896
Good

2969
02:36:33,408 --> 02:36:33,920
You should do that

2970
02:36:34,944 --> 02:36:36,480
I think that is an ethical position

2971
02:36:37,504 --> 02:36:38,784
That's an interesting thought

2972
02:36:39,296 --> 02:36:43,136
But I don't think that if you find out your kid is going to have Downs

2973
02:36:43,904 --> 02:36:45,184
And then you abort them

2974
02:36:45,696 --> 02:36:46,720
I don't think that meant

2975
02:36:48,000 --> 02:36:49,280
That's an interesting question

2976
02:36:49,536 --> 02:36:50,816
It's it's

2977
02:36:51,072 --> 02:36:52,352
Incredibly complicated

2978
02:36:52,608 --> 02:36:53,888
Because I don't think that like

2979
02:36:54,400 --> 02:36:55,936
What the reason that when I

2980
02:36:56,448 --> 02:36:58,240
I am trying to put it back towards

2981
02:36:58,496 --> 02:37:01,824
I understand.

2982
02:37:02,080 --> 02:37:08,224
When I talk about everyone

2983
02:37:08,480 --> 02:37:09,248
How you and I are meant to

2984
02:37:10,528 --> 02:37:11,552
A lot of it comes from

2985
02:37:12,064 --> 02:37:12,576
Are genetics

2986
02:37:12,832 --> 02:37:13,344
And it's just

2987
02:37:14,112 --> 02:37:15,904
The cards we were dealt in our life

2988
02:37:16,928 --> 02:37:17,952
We have Annie

2989
02:37:18,208 --> 02:37:19,232
Hugo stamp

2990
02:37:19,488 --> 02:37:20,512
About how I

2991
02:37:20,768 --> 02:37:22,304
I wouldn't be who I was if I did

2992
02:37:22,560 --> 02:37:23,584
Didn't have those struggles

2993
02:37:23,840 --> 02:37:24,608
Listen what have you been

2994
02:37:25,120 --> 02:37:26,912
If we were born didn't have those

2995
02:37:27,680 --> 02:37:28,192
Pretty cool

2996
02:37:28,448 --> 02:37:29,472
Probably be pretty fine

2997
02:37:29,728 --> 02:37:32,032
Because there wouldn't be the suicide

2998
02:37:32,544 --> 02:37:34,592
BV years wasted

2999
02:37:35,104 --> 02:37:35,872
Of Our Lives

3000
02:37:36,128 --> 02:37:36,896
So that's true

3001
02:37:37,152 --> 02:37:43,296
There is that and like I don't really understand how my creativity is really been bolstered by

3002
02:37:44,832 --> 02:37:46,368
If it has or if it has

3003
02:37:46,624 --> 02:37:48,672
Who knows I probably just

3004
02:37:48,928 --> 02:37:50,720
Hurt a bunch of other people because of it

3005
02:37:50,976 --> 02:37:51,488
Most likely

3006
02:37:51,744 --> 02:37:54,048
So this vad event like

3007
02:37:55,072 --> 02:37:57,120
Lake neurodiversity is gray

3008
02:37:57,632 --> 02:37:59,168
88 should

3009
02:37:59,680 --> 02:38:00,192
Exist

3010
02:38:00,448 --> 02:38:03,264
At 4 at least we think so

3011
02:38:03,520 --> 02:38:04,032
You know

3012
02:38:04,800 --> 02:38:06,848
It should exist more than it

3013
02:38:07,104 --> 02:38:08,384
Shouldn't in terms of

3014
02:38:08,640 --> 02:38:10,432
Killing all abnormal babies

3015
02:38:10,688 --> 02:38:12,224
Or whatever if you want to call it baby

3016
02:38:14,272 --> 02:38:16,576
Which is why we should kill Ethan Hawke

3017
02:38:16,832 --> 02:38:17,344
Anyways

3018
02:38:17,856 --> 02:38:20,160
Sunrise

3019
02:38:21,184 --> 02:38:24,512
I like Mo Stephen Hawking

3020
02:38:24,768 --> 02:38:27,584
I got a lot of s*** for saying how much I love you.

3021
02:38:28,096 --> 02:38:28,608
I don't know about that

3022
02:38:29,632 --> 02:38:30,144
So

3023
02:38:31,168 --> 02:38:34,752
It becomes a very complicated conversation I think

3024
02:38:35,008 --> 02:38:35,520
In terms

3025
02:38:37,056 --> 02:38:37,824
What is

3026
02:38:38,592 --> 02:38:39,616
Technically paws

3027
02:38:40,640 --> 02:38:41,920
And what is

3028
02:38:43,968 --> 02:38:44,992
Worth exploring

3029
02:38:45,760 --> 02:38:47,552
I don't think it's worth exploring

3030
02:38:47,808 --> 02:38:50,368
Aborting every person who has

3031
02:38:51,136 --> 02:38:52,416
I think it is worth

3032
02:38:52,672 --> 02:38:53,184
Exploring

3033
02:38:53,440 --> 02:38:54,464
The idea of

3034
02:38:55,744 --> 02:38:56,256
Gmod

3035
02:38:56,512 --> 02:38:57,024
Application

3036
02:38:57,280 --> 02:39:01,632
Right when you're not

3037
02:39:01,888 --> 02:39:02,400
Because of down

3038
02:39:02,912 --> 02:39:03,424
Drum Folk

3039
02:39:03,680 --> 02:39:05,216
But because of

3040
02:39:05,984 --> 02:39:06,496
Other

3041
02:39:07,008 --> 02:39:09,056
Mutations that can happen is that we'll just

3042
02:39:09,312 --> 02:39:09,824
Make you

3043
02:39:14,688 --> 02:39:15,200
Is that

3044
02:39:15,456 --> 02:39:15,968
Or is that

3045
02:39:16,480 --> 02:39:17,248
Killing everybody

3046
02:39:18,784 --> 02:39:19,552
Do you know what I'm saying

3047
02:39:19,808 --> 02:39:22,368
So if you ever

3048
02:39:22,880 --> 02:39:23,904
I'm a Bipolar person

3049
02:39:24,160 --> 02:39:25,184
I will kill you in

3050
02:39:25,440 --> 02:39:25,952
Second

3051
02:39:26,208 --> 02:39:26,976
Not a bad idea

3052
02:39:27,488 --> 02:39:30,048
My life

3053
02:39:33,888 --> 02:39:37,728
Imagine if we never met

3054
02:39:39,008 --> 02:39:43,616
You'll be married you have two kids

3055
02:39:43,872 --> 02:39:44,384
H m

3056
02:39:44,640 --> 02:39:46,688
I mean

3057
02:39:49,248 --> 02:39:49,760
So

3058
02:39:50,016 --> 02:39:51,296
If you remove

3059
02:39:51,552 --> 02:39:52,576
Bipolar Syndrome from

3060
02:39:54,112 --> 02:39:54,880
Have you killed

3061
02:39:57,440 --> 02:39:59,232
Likely the point being

3062
02:39:59,488 --> 02:40:00,000
Melcher

3063
02:40:00,256 --> 02:40:00,768
Sure

3064
02:40:02,048 --> 02:40:04,864
Physically the the human being that I am

3065
02:40:05,376 --> 02:40:06,656
Is not dead

3066
02:40:07,168 --> 02:40:09,984
And yet at the same time being that I am now

3067
02:40:10,496 --> 02:40:11,520
Is rhetoric

3068
02:40:11,776 --> 02:40:12,288
Actively destroyed

3069
02:40:12,544 --> 02:40:13,568
It's like a time travel

3070
02:40:13,824 --> 02:40:17,664
I know it could have been also

3071
02:40:18,176 --> 02:40:23,808
It is what it is it's not worth having

3072
02:40:24,064 --> 02:40:26,368
Write the argument that is worth having

3073
02:40:26,624 --> 02:40:27,648
Is about

3074
02:40:29,696 --> 02:40:31,232
People with Down Syndrome or not

3075
02:40:32,256 --> 02:40:33,280
I mean they cost more

3076
02:40:34,816 --> 02:40:36,352
Keep alive to other human beings

3077
02:40:40,704 --> 02:40:41,216
But

3078
02:40:41,472 --> 02:40:44,288
I also think they're lies would probably be better

3079
02:40:44,800 --> 02:40:46,848
If they hadn't been born with Down Syndrome

3080
02:40:47,104 --> 02:40:51,200
I would not do you know what else

3081
02:40:51,456 --> 02:40:52,736
I don't think their lives are

3082
02:40:53,248 --> 02:40:55,808
Cuz they have Down syndrome cuz they are

3083
02:40:56,320 --> 02:40:57,600
Living their lives they have

3084
02:40:58,112 --> 02:40:59,136
Autonomy they have

3085
02:41:00,672 --> 02:41:01,184
Perfect

3086
02:41:01,440 --> 02:41:02,976
Ability to love

3087
02:41:03,232 --> 02:41:03,744
To work

3088
02:41:04,000 --> 02:41:05,280
22 exist

3089
02:41:06,048 --> 02:41:06,560
But

3090
02:41:08,352 --> 02:41:08,864
I don't know

3091
02:41:09,376 --> 02:41:11,680
Don't complicate

3092
02:41:14,240 --> 02:41:17,312
What is the to what extent is

3093
02:41:19,616 --> 02:41:20,896
Not having Down syndrome

3094
02:41:21,152 --> 02:41:21,920
Detrimental

3095
02:41:22,944 --> 02:41:24,736
Flag Garden we should all

3096
02:41:24,992 --> 02:41:27,296
Let me ask you a question

3097
02:41:27,808 --> 02:41:29,600
Would you be happier

3098
02:41:31,648 --> 02:41:32,416
In

3099
02:41:33,184 --> 02:41:35,744
I'd like many people that I've known with Down Syndrome

3100
02:41:36,256 --> 02:41:38,048
Find far more happy

3101
02:41:38,816 --> 02:41:39,584
Out of

3102
02:41:39,840 --> 02:41:40,864
Simpler things that I do

3103
02:41:41,632 --> 02:41:43,424
Like would I be a happier person

3104
02:41:43,936 --> 02:41:50,080
Would I be more satisfied person who you're buying into a little bit of money

3105
02:41:50,336 --> 02:41:52,896
The issue

3106
02:41:53,152 --> 02:41:54,176
What exactly

3107
02:41:54,432 --> 02:41:57,504
What mythology what mythology

3108
02:41:57,760 --> 02:42:01,600
I am buying into in regards to a mental illness

3109
02:42:01,856 --> 02:42:04,160
I don't have them you know what I'm saying

3110
02:42:04,416 --> 02:42:10,560
It's really complicated and within the seven and a half hour long

3111
02:42:11,072 --> 02:42:15,936
From all that from all the research I can do in the myths I can sort of

3112
02:42:16,192 --> 02:42:17,216
I ingest

3113
02:42:17,472 --> 02:42:18,496
And work through

3114
02:42:19,520 --> 02:42:20,032
First of all

3115
02:42:20,800 --> 02:42:21,312
It goes down

3116
02:42:21,568 --> 02:42:22,080
Argument

3117
02:42:22,592 --> 02:42:24,128
They are just like us

3118
02:42:24,384 --> 02:42:26,688
All the people I know

3119
02:42:26,944 --> 02:42:28,224
And then beyond

3120
02:42:28,480 --> 02:42:28,992
Don't think

3121
02:42:29,248 --> 02:42:29,760
The last

3122
02:42:31,296 --> 02:42:36,672
Feel like the entire conversation we've had has been about how killing them is a bad idea

3123
02:42:38,208 --> 02:42:43,840
Ultimate Euro layout

3124
02:42:44,096 --> 02:42:46,656
Murder right

3125
02:42:46,912 --> 02:42:49,728
It's all a bad idea

3126
02:42:52,032 --> 02:42:52,544
You wrote

3127
02:42:53,056 --> 02:42:53,568
Therapeutic

3128
02:42:54,080 --> 02:42:54,592
Possibly

3129
02:42:56,384 --> 02:42:57,152
Not even get rid of

3130
02:42:57,664 --> 02:42:58,432
People who have

3131
02:43:00,736 --> 02:43:01,248
Other genetic

3132
02:43:02,784 --> 02:43:03,296
Woody's

3133
02:43:03,552 --> 02:43:07,648
Before he's even seems like a terrible work those things

3134
02:43:07,904 --> 02:43:08,928
That will make your life

3135
02:43:09,696 --> 02:43:10,720
Completely miserable

3136
02:43:11,488 --> 02:43:14,048
You'll just be live at and it's not

3137
02:43:14,560 --> 02:43:16,096
Picture books

3138
02:43:16,352 --> 02:43:18,656
Researching

3139
02:43:19,168 --> 02:43:20,192
Towards that

3140
02:43:20,448 --> 02:43:22,240
Doesn't seem bad to me

3141
02:43:22,496 --> 02:43:25,056
Right but now when you apply it to like

3142
02:43:25,312 --> 02:43:27,616
Oh this person will be depressed kill them

3143
02:43:28,128 --> 02:43:28,896
Right

3144
02:43:29,152 --> 02:43:31,456
Right we won't get other LaRosa's

3145
02:43:31,968 --> 02:43:36,064
We will just just consider all of these different diseases

3146
02:43:36,320 --> 02:43:38,880
Yeah you're you're ugly

3147
02:43:39,136 --> 02:43:41,440
Yeah your otherwise and yet at the same

3148
02:43:41,696 --> 02:43:42,976
Without

3149
02:43:43,232 --> 02:43:45,536
Without being able to conquer that life

3150
02:43:46,560 --> 02:43:47,840
Are you capable of

3151
02:43:48,352 --> 02:43:49,888
Transcendence briante you know it's like

3152
02:43:50,144 --> 02:43:51,168
Whole f******

3153
02:43:51,680 --> 02:43:52,192
Sanity

3154
02:43:53,216 --> 02:43:53,728
I don't know

3155
02:43:53,984 --> 02:43:55,008
It's I don't know

3156
02:43:55,520 --> 02:43:57,824
Still

3157
02:43:58,080 --> 02:43:59,360
Genetically modified corn

3158
02:43:59,616 --> 02:44:05,760
We spent a half-hour not knowing which way to land on this but I think it's

3159
02:44:06,016 --> 02:44:08,320
The same time we've done more analysis

3160
02:44:08,576 --> 02:44:12,672
Going to do about this in the history of his entire life

3161
02:44:14,720 --> 02:44:16,000
They piss all over

3162
02:44:17,024 --> 02:44:19,072
Timberline

3163
02:44:22,400 --> 02:44:26,752
But you're all going to be there you're all now

3164
02:44:27,520 --> 02:44:31,360
Funny

3165
02:44:31,616 --> 02:44:37,760
Astarte's

3166
02:44:38,016 --> 02:44:40,064
Is it

3167
02:44:40,320 --> 02:44:42,624
Aggressive

3168
02:44:43,648 --> 02:44:44,672
Is mentally ill

3169
02:44:51,328 --> 02:44:56,448
Emerald

3170
02:45:17,696 --> 02:45:18,976
I'll tell you this

3171
02:45:19,232 --> 02:45:20,768
You're going to kill little

3172
02:45:21,024 --> 02:45:25,376
Retarded children

3173
02:45:25,888 --> 02:45:30,496
You think you're going to do stuff like that and you're going to get away with something you going to feel powerful

3174
02:45:30,752 --> 02:45:33,312
Hearing a spiritually waddle around in front of somebody

3175
02:45:33,568 --> 02:45:37,664
Because you're such a big man

3176
02:45:39,968 --> 02:45:46,112
Miserable horrible life and you want to creep out your

3177
02:45:46,368 --> 02:45:51,744
Creeper

3178
02:45:52,512 --> 02:45:54,560
You want to shove it.

3179
02:45:57,888 --> 02:46:03,519
You know how it happened

3180
02:46:12,735 --> 02:46:18,879
They're genetically sabotaging us

3181
02:46:19,135 --> 02:46:25,279
All genetically falling apart

3182
02:46:26,815 --> 02:46:31,423
We admitted it having kids

3183
02:46:31,679 --> 02:46:32,959
Replica Throne going

3184
02:46:36,799 --> 02:46:39,103
Frozen

3185
02:46:39,615 --> 02:46:41,151
5 lesbian

3186
02:46:41,407 --> 02:46:43,199
And if you're lesbian

3187
02:46:43,711 --> 02:46:46,271
First Coronavirus

3188
02:47:00,863 --> 02:47:05,471
Joshua

3189
02:47:05,727 --> 02:47:11,103
This is their deployed anti-human

3190
02:47:13,663 --> 02:47:15,711
How They Roll this out on other planets

3191
02:47:36,447 --> 02:47:39,007
Maybe the Orchid Man gave us the Bible

3192
02:47:43,871 --> 02:47:44,639
Divvy org

3193
02:47:44,895 --> 02:47:48,479
Can man give a survival Old Hickory

3194
02:47:48,735 --> 02:47:51,551
The ages-old question salt

3195
02:47:52,575 --> 02:47:55,903
Old Orchard man

3196
02:47:58,719 --> 02:48:00,767
For us to have a

3197
02:48:01,023 --> 02:48:03,583
25-minute tangent where we're discussing

3198
02:48:04,095 --> 02:48:07,679
08 you know there's this positive versus negative

3199
02:48:07,935 --> 02:48:10,239
And then Alex Jones comes back in with

3200
02:48:10,495 --> 02:48:15,871
The Orkin man gave us the Bible and then at the end

3201
02:48:16,127 --> 02:48:17,151
Commercialism

3202
02:48:22,527 --> 02:48:23,039
Alright

3203
02:48:23,295 --> 02:48:28,415
Alright

3204
02:48:28,671 --> 02:48:33,279
Like give Alex a little bit of

3205
02:48:33,535 --> 02:48:34,047
Conclusion

3206
02:48:34,559 --> 02:48:39,679
There isn't that is not

3207
02:48:39,935 --> 02:48:41,471
In some way utilitarian

3208
02:48:42,495 --> 02:48:43,775
You know what I'm saying

3209
02:48:44,031 --> 02:48:48,383
Like even our conversation ultimately wound up with

3210
02:48:48,895 --> 02:48:50,431
What's more useful or what

3211
02:48:50,943 --> 02:48:52,991
As opposed to some sort of

3212
02:48:53,759 --> 02:48:55,295
Metaphysical idea

3213
02:48:55,551 --> 02:48:57,599
No I think my absolute

3214
02:48:57,855 --> 02:48:58,367
Conclusion is

3215
02:48:59,903 --> 02:49:00,927
Avur

3216
02:49:03,231 --> 02:49:03,743
I was going

3217
02:49:03,999 --> 02:49:06,815
No I was going to go the route of

3218
02:49:09,375 --> 02:49:10,655
You are going to be born

3219
02:49:11,935 --> 02:49:12,447
Your life

3220
02:49:13,215 --> 02:49:13,727
Is going to be

3221
02:49:13,983 --> 02:49:14,751
A complete disaster

3222
02:49:16,543 --> 02:49:17,055
Your genetic

3223
02:49:17,823 --> 02:49:18,591
Which is not your fault

3224
02:49:20,127 --> 02:49:20,639
Gene editing

3225
02:49:21,919 --> 02:49:22,431
They can

3226
02:49:22,943 --> 02:49:23,455
Fix that

3227
02:49:30,879 --> 02:49:31,647
That's my position

3228
02:49:31,903 --> 02:49:32,415
Right

3229
02:49:32,671 --> 02:49:35,743
I think that people born Townsend probably

3230
02:49:36,511 --> 02:49:37,279
Have a

3231
02:49:39,327 --> 02:49:41,119
Sign position with having their life

3232
02:49:41,887 --> 02:49:42,655
Be what they are

3233
02:49:42,911 --> 02:49:43,423
And I respect

3234
02:49:44,447 --> 02:49:45,471
But at the same

3235
02:49:45,727 --> 02:49:46,239
Same time

3236
02:49:46,495 --> 02:49:48,031
I think that they probably

3237
02:49:48,287 --> 02:49:49,567
Would be better off if

3238
02:49:49,823 --> 02:49:50,591
If they had been born

3239
02:49:50,847 --> 02:49:51,359
Not have

3240
02:49:52,639 --> 02:49:53,407
I think that might be

3241
02:49:53,663 --> 02:49:54,943
Slightly controversial

3242
02:49:55,199 --> 02:49:58,015
And I want to be very clear what I'm saying is

3243
02:49:58,527 --> 02:49:59,551
Not discounting

3244
02:49:59,807 --> 02:50:00,319
Their life

3245
02:50:00,575 --> 02:50:01,087
As it is

3246
02:50:01,343 --> 02:50:03,135
Yeah I'm I'm I'm saying

3247
02:50:03,391 --> 02:50:04,671
That their life

3248
02:50:05,439 --> 02:50:06,719
I had it not been

3249
02:50:07,231 --> 02:50:07,999
Would be better

3250
02:50:08,511 --> 02:50:09,279
Inasmuch as

3251
02:50:10,047 --> 02:50:10,815
Like I related

3252
02:50:11,327 --> 02:50:11,839
You and I

3253
02:50:12,095 --> 02:50:13,631
Right said we not had the

3254
02:50:14,655 --> 02:50:15,935
Predisposition

3255
02:50:16,703 --> 02:50:17,215
Towards

3256
02:50:17,471 --> 02:50:17,983
Depression

3257
02:50:18,239 --> 02:50:19,519
Mental illness

3258
02:50:19,775 --> 02:50:20,287
This would be better

3259
02:50:21,823 --> 02:50:22,847
The the next

3260
02:50:23,359 --> 02:50:23,871
Soon though because

3261
02:50:25,151 --> 02:50:25,663
If

3262
02:50:26,175 --> 02:50:26,687
There are

3263
02:50:31,039 --> 02:50:32,319
Are they going to be make

3264
02:50:33,087 --> 02:50:33,599
Asian that is

3265
02:50:34,111 --> 02:50:34,879
Fast forward

3266
02:50:36,415 --> 02:50:36,927
4 best

3267
02:50:37,183 --> 02:50:37,695
Their life

3268
02:50:38,719 --> 02:50:41,023
And so that's where we get into a different f

3269
02:50:41,279 --> 02:50:45,631
Pickles

3270
02:50:46,143 --> 02:50:51,263
Exactly argument about something

3271
02:50:51,519 --> 02:50:54,591
You know what if that's like it's like f****** cars like

3272
02:50:54,847 --> 02:51:00,991
Okay. Here's where I would say it like I think the parents should never view their children as extent

3273
02:51:01,247 --> 02:51:02,015
Oceans of themselves

3274
02:51:02,527 --> 02:51:04,063
I don't think that it should be like this is

3275
02:51:04,319 --> 02:51:05,087
The part of me

3276
02:51:07,135 --> 02:51:07,647
Disagree with

3277
02:51:08,927 --> 02:51:09,439
Of course

3278
02:51:09,695 --> 02:51:12,511
Ancestors are with him still in Albany

3279
02:51:12,767 --> 02:51:14,303
Exact time

3280
02:51:14,559 --> 02:51:17,119
But I would say that if

3281
02:51:19,423 --> 02:51:21,471
I believe this in terms of just like abortion

3282
02:51:21,727 --> 02:51:22,239
.

3283
02:51:22,495 --> 02:51:23,775
Like if you are

3284
02:51:24,031 --> 02:51:24,799
Are not able to

3285
02:51:25,055 --> 02:51:26,079
Care for a child

3286
02:51:26,847 --> 02:51:27,359
Then you shouldn't

3287
02:51:27,615 --> 02:51:28,383
Have them

3288
02:51:28,639 --> 02:51:31,455
If it comes down to it and you're an adult

3289
02:51:31,711 --> 02:51:32,223
And you're able to

3290
02:51:32,479 --> 02:51:32,991
Care for

3291
02:51:33,247 --> 02:51:34,271
A child

3292
02:51:34,527 --> 02:51:35,807
2 is just a normal

3293
02:51:37,855 --> 02:51:38,367
Define doubt

3294
02:51:38,623 --> 02:51:39,135
But they have

3295
02:51:40,927 --> 02:51:42,207
Normal

3296
02:51:42,463 --> 02:51:45,279
Yeah well but normal normal this weird sucked up thing

3297
02:51:45,535 --> 02:51:46,303
Alex

3298
02:51:46,559 --> 02:51:49,375
Yells about it cuz In that clip with down

3299
02:51:53,215 --> 02:51:53,727
Getting out of

3300
02:51:53,983 --> 02:51:55,263
Myself is Down syndrome

3301
02:51:59,359 --> 02:52:00,383
But

3302
02:52:00,639 --> 02:52:03,199
They they're like what is a normal person

3303
02:52:03,455 --> 02:52:04,479
Sin cos tan Alex is like

3304
02:52:04,991 --> 02:52:05,503
F*** you

3305
02:52:05,759 --> 02:52:06,527
Normal

3306
02:52:06,783 --> 02:52:11,135
Well how many times have you called trans people not normal

3307
02:52:11,903 --> 02:52:12,927
You look at

3308
02:52:13,183 --> 02:52:14,207
You look at the

3309
02:52:14,463 --> 02:52:15,743
But then the question

3310
02:52:15,999 --> 02:52:16,511
Then become

3311
02:52:17,791 --> 02:52:18,559
You know if you want to go to

3312
02:52:21,887 --> 02:52:22,399
Cost

3313
02:52:22,911 --> 02:52:23,423
At this

3314
02:52:25,215 --> 02:52:25,983
More

3315
02:52:26,239 --> 02:52:26,751
To society

3316
02:52:27,775 --> 02:52:28,287
Then

3317
02:52:28,799 --> 02:52:29,311
Somebody who's

3318
02:52:29,567 --> 02:52:30,079
Raised

3319
02:52:32,127 --> 02:52:33,663
I don't how is that

3320
02:52:33,919 --> 02:52:34,431
Because they're trans

3321
02:52:34,943 --> 02:52:35,455
No

3322
02:52:35,967 --> 02:52:36,479
Because of

3323
02:52:36,991 --> 02:52:37,759
Systemic

3324
02:52:39,039 --> 02:52:39,807
Prejudice

3325
02:52:40,063 --> 02:52:40,575
This is within

3326
02:52:40,831 --> 02:52:41,343
Society

3327
02:52:42,367 --> 02:52:42,879
Out in

3328
02:52:44,159 --> 02:52:44,671
Homelessness

3329
02:52:45,183 --> 02:52:46,463
And so on and so forth

3330
02:52:46,719 --> 02:52:47,487
That wind up

3331
02:52:47,743 --> 02:52:48,511
Forcing them

3332
02:52:49,023 --> 02:52:51,583
To cost more the so then your utillian argument

3333
02:52:51,839 --> 02:52:52,351
Are you

3334
02:52:52,863 --> 02:52:53,631
Terry an argument

3335
02:52:54,911 --> 02:52:55,679
Goes back

3336
02:52:55,935 --> 02:52:58,495
Further towards Society

3337
02:52:58,751 --> 02:52:59,263
Just against them

3338
02:53:01,311 --> 02:53:02,847
Keeps going back in back

3339
02:53:03,359 --> 02:53:04,639
I don't think this

3340
02:53:04,895 --> 02:53:07,967
I agree with you to some extent but I don't think this works because

3341
02:53:08,479 --> 02:53:10,783
Of this is all eugenics

3342
02:53:11,807 --> 02:53:12,575
Brighton

3343
02:53:12,831 --> 02:53:13,599
Exactly

3344
02:53:13,855 --> 02:53:16,415
That isn't something necessarily

3345
02:53:16,671 --> 02:53:18,207
I don't think at this point you've

3346
02:53:18,463 --> 02:53:19,743
Intel from jeans

3347
02:53:20,255 --> 02:53:22,815
Rite Aid in utero

3348
02:53:23,071 --> 02:53:27,423
This is all about like trying to get rid of unfavorable

3349
02:53:27,679 --> 02:53:28,447
Entities

3350
02:53:28,703 --> 02:53:29,983
Right In Utero

3351
02:53:30,239 --> 02:53:30,751
Right

3352
02:53:31,007 --> 02:53:34,591
You and I are having a very interesting Eugenics conversation

3353
02:53:35,103 --> 02:53:37,663
And unfortunately

3354
02:53:38,943 --> 02:53:45,087
Eugenics is a rough thing to have a conversation about a worried that I'm a fan of any

3355
02:53:45,343 --> 02:53:50,463
Nugenix conversation that I'm sounding like

3356
02:53:50,975 --> 02:53:52,255
I am anti

3357
02:53:52,511 --> 02:53:53,279
People with Down

3358
02:53:55,071 --> 02:53:55,839
I think it's just

3359
02:53:56,095 --> 02:53:58,399
I think it's just one of those things that about

3360
02:53:58,655 --> 02:54:00,191
There's there's there are

3361
02:54:00,959 --> 02:54:01,983
So many things

3362
02:54:02,495 --> 02:54:03,007
Right

3363
02:54:03,263 --> 02:54:04,031
Zip makeup

3364
02:54:04,287 --> 02:54:05,055
4

3365
02:54:05,311 --> 02:54:05,823
The ID

3366
02:54:06,079 --> 02:54:06,847
Dia of

3367
02:54:08,127 --> 02:54:09,919
It's expensive to keep you alive

3368
02:54:10,175 --> 02:54:11,455
Right

3369
02:54:11,711 --> 02:54:14,527
In the same way that with people who are depressed

3370
02:54:14,783 --> 02:54:19,391
The same way with people who are borderline personality

3371
02:54:20,415 --> 02:54:22,975
What you were bringing up about neurodiversity

3372
02:54:23,487 --> 02:54:24,767
Is absolutely

3373
02:54:25,023 --> 02:54:25,535
True

3374
02:54:25,791 --> 02:54:26,559
In terms of that stuff

3375
02:54:28,607 --> 02:54:29,119
When I

3376
02:54:29,375 --> 02:54:30,399
What I have said

3377
02:54:30,655 --> 02:54:35,519
Already getting really f***** up

3378
02:54:38,079 --> 02:54:39,103
I might be projecting a

3379
02:54:40,639 --> 02:54:41,151
And that's

3380
02:54:41,919 --> 02:54:43,199
But when I say

3381
02:54:44,735 --> 02:54:45,247
Think

3382
02:54:45,759 --> 02:54:46,271
That

3383
02:54:46,527 --> 02:54:47,039
Like

3384
02:54:47,295 --> 02:54:48,831
My personality is based

3385
02:54:50,367 --> 02:54:50,879
I've had

3386
02:54:51,135 --> 02:54:51,647
I would

3387
02:54:51,903 --> 02:54:52,415
Want

3388
02:54:52,671 --> 02:54:53,183
To not

3389
02:54:53,439 --> 02:54:53,951
I have this

3390
02:54:55,487 --> 02:54:55,999
That's Bass

3391
02:54:56,255 --> 02:54:58,303
On only listen

3392
02:54:59,839 --> 02:55:00,863
That isn't saying

3393
02:55:01,119 --> 02:55:03,679
F*** you you're you're wrong to have the life you have

3394
02:55:04,703 --> 02:55:05,215
More

3395
02:55:07,007 --> 02:55:07,519
No one wants

3396
02:55:08,543 --> 02:55:12,383
Don't want no one wants to be depressed no one want borderline

3397
02:55:12,639 --> 02:55:18,783
Right I've never I just don't want you texting

3398
02:55:19,039 --> 02:55:22,111
Ford F-100

3399
02:55:22,623 --> 02:55:27,743
Recovering from trying to kill myself like but at the same time

3400
02:55:28,511 --> 02:55:30,303
Who You Are

3401
02:55:30,559 --> 02:55:31,071
Rough

3402
02:55:31,839 --> 02:55:33,119
Ratably difficult

3403
02:55:33,375 --> 02:55:34,143
Space

3404
02:55:34,911 --> 02:55:35,423
That I'm

3405
02:55:36,191 --> 02:55:36,703
Admittedly

3406
02:55:37,215 --> 02:55:38,495
Projecting our

3407
02:55:39,007 --> 02:55:41,311
Experiences of Portland escort

3408
02:55:41,567 --> 02:55:42,847
Two people with

3409
02:55:43,359 --> 02:55:44,639
And I'm not sure that's fair

3410
02:55:44,895 --> 02:55:47,967
I'm not sure I might be wrong I might be wrong

3411
02:55:48,223 --> 02:55:48,735
No

3412
02:55:49,247 --> 02:55:49,759
But

3413
02:55:50,015 --> 02:55:52,831
I think I think her ultimate conversation

3414
02:55:53,087 --> 02:55:54,111
Love to be born normal

3415
02:55:55,391 --> 02:55:57,439
You and I

3416
02:55:59,743 --> 02:56:00,255
WeedMaps

3417
02:56:00,511 --> 02:56:01,535
Plenty of normal people

3418
02:56:04,351 --> 02:56:05,119
I know right

3419
02:56:05,631 --> 02:56:11,775
Wish I was I wish I was a little more little more.

3420
02:56:12,543 --> 02:56:17,407
Ultimately our conversation boils down to

3421
02:56:18,175 --> 02:56:19,199
I don't know the answer

3422
02:56:19,967 --> 02:56:21,247
I'm interested to know

3423
02:56:21,503 --> 02:56:24,319
Don't know the answer I think there's a lot of interest

3424
02:56:24,575 --> 02:56:26,367
Things about neurodiversity

3425
02:56:26,623 --> 02:56:28,159
And at the end of the day

3426
02:56:29,695 --> 02:56:31,743
Do not feel like I have

3427
02:56:31,999 --> 02:56:33,023
Any qualification

3428
02:56:35,071 --> 02:56:36,095
For anyone else

3429
02:56:36,607 --> 02:56:39,167
And I strongly don't think this documentary was about you

3430
02:56:39,423 --> 02:56:45,567
3 minutes

3431
02:56:45,823 --> 02:56:46,335
But answer here

3432
02:56:46,591 --> 02:56:47,103
Right

3433
02:56:47,615 --> 02:56:48,895
If you are parents

3434
02:56:50,175 --> 02:56:50,943
Even more so

3435
02:56:51,455 --> 02:56:52,223
If your mother

3436
02:56:52,735 --> 02:56:54,015
Can you make a decision

3437
02:56:54,271 --> 02:56:56,063
About what's in your goddamn body

3438
02:56:57,087 --> 02:56:58,879
I have no

3439
02:56:59,391 --> 02:57:00,159
Judgment on

3440
02:57:00,671 --> 02:57:01,183
Cosine

3441
02:57:01,695 --> 02:57:05,279
You have your you have to make a decision

3442
02:57:06,815 --> 02:57:07,839
To tell you

3443
02:57:08,095 --> 02:57:08,863
What is the best

3444
02:57:09,887 --> 02:57:10,399
Etc

3445
02:57:11,167 --> 02:57:11,935
I'm in the wrong

3446
02:57:12,447 --> 02:57:12,959
Totally

3447
02:57:13,471 --> 02:57:17,055
So if you want to raise if you want to raise a child

3448
02:57:17,311 --> 02:57:22,687
Syndrome and if you want to deal with the fact that maybe the child that you raised with Down Syndrome resent

3449
02:57:22,943 --> 02:57:23,967
For raising them was down

3450
02:57:24,735 --> 02:57:28,575
Or if you want to deal with the child that resent 24

3451
02:57:28,831 --> 02:57:32,671
Or if you want to deal with the child who resent you for raising them whatever way

3452
02:57:32,927 --> 02:57:34,207
That's your choice

3453
02:57:34,463 --> 02:57:37,279
You don't want to do that to your choice and so on until

3454
02:57:37,791 --> 02:57:43,935
I'm not going to decide for anyone else

3455
02:57:44,191 --> 02:57:44,703
Addition that it might

3456
02:57:44,959 --> 02:57:48,543
I cost you more is not at all that application of like

3457
02:57:48,799 --> 02:57:50,335
Lauren indication that you should

3458
02:57:50,591 --> 02:57:52,383
Kill all of them solutely

3459
02:57:54,687 --> 02:57:58,015
You should if you were to give them up for adoption

3460
02:57:58,271 --> 02:57:58,783
End

3461
02:57:59,039 --> 02:58:01,599
Then the society

3462
02:58:04,671 --> 02:58:05,695
All comes down to this

3463
02:58:05,951 --> 02:58:07,487
Confluence of

3464
02:58:09,535 --> 02:58:10,047
It is

3465
02:58:11,071 --> 02:58:12,351
Irresponsible

3466
02:58:12,607 --> 02:58:15,167
For you and I to make that decision

3467
02:58:15,679 --> 02:58:16,191
Society

3468
02:58:16,703 --> 02:58:21,311
I think it's responsible for most people or even governing body

3469
02:58:21,567 --> 02:58:22,591
But a Jordan

3470
02:58:22,847 --> 02:58:23,359
You're f***** up

3471
02:58:23,871 --> 02:58:24,639

3474
02:58:30,527 --> 02:58:35,647
This isn't a whole bunch more of you and I tried

3475
02:58:35,903 --> 02:58:36,927
This is degrading

3476
02:58:41,279 --> 02:58:43,327
This next clip is degrading

3477
02:58:43,583 --> 02:58:46,143
But it it's fun ain't as much as we

3478
02:58:46,655 --> 02:58:48,191
Really get to see how Alex.

3479
02:58:49,983 --> 02:58:50,495
Okay

3480
02:58:51,007 --> 02:58:53,311
I don't want to be in your communist system

3481

They're not making fun

Is first of all

3528
03:02:23,999 --> 03:02:25,023

He's along

3547
03:03:10,591 --> 03:03:11,615
For the other

3548
03:03:13,407 --> 03:03:14,175
Being covered by rail

3549
03:03:15,199 --> 03:03:16,479
They're not being

3550
03:03:23,903 --> 03:03:24,415
Rules

3551
03:03:28,767 --> 03:03:30,815
Bring it down syndrome

3552
03:03:31,071 --> 03:03:34,911
Yeah is that what we want

3553
03:03:35,423 --> 03:03:37,471
That stops

3554
03:03:37,727 --> 03:03:40,287
Or write issue and starts being a

3555
03:03:40,799 --> 03:03:42,591
What the f*** kind of monster would

3556
03:03:42,847 --> 03:03:45,663
Do this is what we would have known about that win

3557
03:03:45,919 --> 03:03:47,967
Came out

3558
03:03:48,223 --> 03:03:54,367
As opposed to finding out about it later

3559
03:03:54,623 --> 03:03:56,671
Over this documentary

3560
03:03:56,927 --> 03:03:57,439
Really need

3561
03:03:57,695 --> 03:03:59,487
To fill time on the show

3562
03:04:01,023 --> 03:04:02,047
I didn't say hey

3563
03:04:02,815 --> 03:04:04,863
You're a piece of crap we want to pay for you

3564
03:04:05,375 --> 03:04:06,399
Be honest

3565
03:04:06,655 --> 03:04:07,679
Look at it

3566
03:04:08,191 --> 03:04:10,239
Challenge

3567
03:04:15,103 --> 03:04:18,687
Everyone of us has what they called genetic disorders everyone of us

3568
03:04:19,199 --> 03:04:25,343
Perfect system Metallica

3569
03:04:25,599 --> 03:04:30,463
1/4

3570
03:04:30,719 --> 03:04:34,303
We're going to kill people

3571
03:04:34,559 --> 03:04:36,607
We're going to have suicide Nets

3572
03:04:41,471 --> 03:04:45,567
Slave labor in Amazon but it's all okay cuz we're liberal

3573
03:04:49,919 --> 03:04:53,503
Following

3574
03:05:08,607 --> 03:05:14,751
God

3575
03:05:20,895 --> 03:05:23,199
No one's going to be taken care of

3576
03:05:23,967 --> 03:05:26,271
I feel like an AI would take better care of

3577
03:05:26,527 --> 03:05:27,039
The Down Syndrome

3578
03:05:29,343 --> 03:05:33,183
Right and here's the other piece I want to

3579
03:05:33,439 --> 03:05:34,463
To to put into

3580
03:05:34,719 --> 03:05:35,999
Play right about now

3581
03:05:38,559 --> 03:05:39,583
Who is going to take

3582
03:05:39,839 --> 03:05:40,351
Take care of them

3583
03:05:44,191 --> 03:05:44,703
Who

3584
03:05:46,239 --> 03:05:47,519
Social program

3585
03:05:48,031 --> 03:05:48,543
Yep

3586
03:05:49,055 --> 03:05:51,359
So what is the advocating for

3587
03:05:51,871 --> 03:05:52,383
Well

3588
03:05:52,895 --> 03:05:53,407
He wants

3589
03:05:53,663 --> 03:05:54,687
Social programs

3590
03:05:55,711 --> 03:05:56,223
But he

3591
03:05:56,479 --> 03:05:59,295
Also wants to remove any and all funding for social

3592
03:05:59,551 --> 03:06:05,695
I want none of my my night going towards right

3593
03:06:07,231 --> 03:06:08,255
Haymaker

3594
03:06:08,511 --> 03:06:11,839
Husto convoluted Miss bulshit they were like

3595
03:06:12,095 --> 03:06:13,631
I recognize

3596
03:06:14,143 --> 03:06:14,655
My

3597
03:06:15,935 --> 03:06:17,727
Light by assassins

3598
03:06:18,239 --> 03:06:19,519
Everyone would be better

3599
03:06:19,775 --> 03:06:21,311
With not

3600
03:06:21,567 --> 03:06:22,079
Having

3601
03:06:22,591 --> 03:06:25,151
Whatever ailment they have

3602
03:06:25,407 --> 03:06:27,199
But at the same time I also think

3603
03:06:29,503 --> 03:06:30,015
Take everybody

3604
03:06:30,783 --> 03:06:31,295
I love it

3605
03:06:31,807 --> 03:06:32,319
I don't know

3606
03:06:33,599 --> 03:06:39,743
Go f*** 20 f****** stupid

3607
03:06:39,999 --> 03:06:43,583
Free it's every argument that you've seen in the Republican debate

3608
03:06:43,839 --> 03:06:45,375
Ever bright which is

3609
03:06:45,631 --> 03:06:46,143
No

3610
03:06:46,399 --> 03:06:49,983
We need to take care of the elderly we need to take care of these people

3611
03:06:50,239 --> 03:06:52,287
Who are homeless we need to take care of them

3612
03:06:52,543 --> 03:06:53,311
Now admittedly

3613
03:06:53,567 --> 03:06:59,711
We need to cut spending and remove any funding to take care of those people but we do need to take care of you

3614
03:06:59,967 --> 03:07:02,015
Certain

3615
03:07:02,271 --> 03:07:03,039
Isn't terms with like

3616
03:07:03,551 --> 03:07:06,623
Hey be afraid about this thing but I do like

3617
03:07:08,415 --> 03:07:10,463
Score

3618
03:07:10,719 --> 03:07:11,487
You don't want your tax

3619
03:07:11,743 --> 03:07:15,327
Texas raised

3620
03:07:15,839 --> 03:07:16,607
Take care of the people

3621
03:07:16,863 --> 03:07:17,375
Who you want

3622
03:07:17,887 --> 03:07:20,959
He's engaged in what is essentially a

3623
03:07:21,215 --> 03:07:21,983
Half hour rant

3624
03:07:22,239 --> 03:07:24,031
Write about how like

3625
03:07:26,591 --> 03:07:29,919
Down syndrome people gone and we realize

3626
03:07:30,175 --> 03:07:30,943
Statistic

3627
03:07:31,199 --> 03:07:32,223
6 due back this up

3628
03:07:33,503 --> 03:07:35,807
They are much more expensive

3629
03:07:36,319 --> 03:07:38,111
Right just from healthcare costs

3630
03:07:38,367 --> 03:07:41,183
And that's not negative that's not bad

3631
03:07:41,695 --> 03:07:44,511
HomePath

3632
03:07:44,767 --> 03:07:45,791
Two or three homeless

3633
03:07:47,071 --> 03:07:48,607
I can't afford

3634
03:07:48,863 --> 03:07:49,631
To give them

3635
03:07:50,399 --> 03:07:51,167
Dollars every

3636
03:07:54,239 --> 03:07:56,287
Everybody paid a dollar more in their taxes

3637
03:07:56,799 --> 03:08:02,943
We can have more dollars to take care of

3638
03:08:03,199 --> 03:08:03,967
In their taxes

3639
03:08:04,223 --> 03:08:05,503
Is it all that money

3640
03:08:05,759 --> 03:08:06,271
Go to

3641
03:08:06,783 --> 03:08:07,295
Shelter

3642
03:08:07,551 --> 03:08:08,319
Supposed to

3643
03:08:08,575 --> 03:08:10,111
Your dollar going towards

3644
03:08:10,623 --> 03:08:11,647
I'll maybe a sandwich

3645
03:08:11,903 --> 03:08:12,927
Or whatever

3646
03:08:13,183 --> 03:08:13,695
Yep big

3647
03:08:13,951 --> 03:08:14,463
Picture

3648
03:08:14,975 --> 03:08:21,119
Everyone coming together could help more than individualistic

3649
03:08:21,375 --> 03:08:23,935
Communism vs. socialism

3650
03:08:24,191 --> 03:08:24,959
Which is the answer

3651
03:08:25,215 --> 03:08:31,359
Hey buddy was like socialism is maybe the way to go and Alex's blanket. For that if you removed

3652
03:08:31,615 --> 03:08:36,735
From the oligarchy oligarchy call issues that we have with Communism and have

3653
03:08:36,991 --> 03:08:41,599
I've had first for the millionth time communism is an economic system

3654
03:08:41,855 --> 03:08:42,367
Nada

3655
03:08:42,623 --> 03:08:43,135
Government

3656
03:08:43,647 --> 03:08:45,183
Authoritarianism

3657
03:08:45,951 --> 03:08:48,511
Militarism

3658
03:08:48,767 --> 03:08:49,279
Is Advil

3659
03:08:49,535 --> 03:08:50,815
Indicating essentially

3660
03:08:51,071 --> 03:08:52,095
For taking

3661
03:08:52,351 --> 03:08:52,863
Here

3662
03:08:53,119 --> 03:08:54,399
Of people who can't take care of them

3663
03:08:55,423 --> 03:08:56,191
Which is great

3664
03:08:56,703 --> 03:08:58,495
Realized

3665
03:08:58,751 --> 03:09:01,823
Everything requires

3666
03:09:02,847 --> 03:09:04,383
Program

3667
03:09:05,407 --> 03:09:07,711
We create economies about love

3668
03:09:08,223 --> 03:09:11,551
Hospital hospital

3669
03:09:11,807 --> 03:09:12,319
Great

3670
03:09:12,575 --> 03:09:14,367
That's not how that works

3671
03:09:14,879 --> 03:09:16,927
Civilization is about taking care of people

3672
03:09:17,183 --> 03:09:23,327
Civilization about

3673
03:09:26,143 --> 03:09:27,423
Weekend

3674
03:09:27,679 --> 03:09:33,823
Sure you're alive

3675
03:09:34,079 --> 03:09:36,383
Decided

3676
03:09:40,479 --> 03:09:41,247
But even

3677
03:09:41,503 --> 03:09:42,015
Hidden wiki

3678
03:09:42,271 --> 03:09:43,295
He's saying it's

3679
03:09:45,343 --> 03:09:47,903
It's right in line with his philosophies

3680
03:09:48,415 --> 03:09:49,951
Withholding

3681
03:09:50,207 --> 03:09:51,487
Care right

3682
03:09:51,743 --> 03:09:52,767

Gilliam

3685
03:09:54,815 --> 03:09:58,399
They just don't keep them alive which is

3686
03:09:59,679 --> 03:10:05,823
You would want them to say that that's the best idea to do it

3687
03:10:06,079 --> 03:10:12,223
Can't afford care if you say what he just said and support the Republic

3688
03:10:12,479 --> 03:10:12,991
Contacts Bill

3689

You're evil

3692
03:10:17,599 --> 03:10:18,367
Either way

3693
03:10:18,879 --> 03:10:20,415
Go fuc yourself you should die

3694
03:10:20,671 --> 03:10:21,439
It's very unclear

3695
03:10:31,679 --> 03:10:33,471
That's why I should.

3696
03:10:40,127 --> 03:10:40,895

Groceries

3700
03:10:52,415 --> 03:10:55,231
Because OU just don't have that

3701
03:10:55,743 --> 03:11:00,607
All about no hospitality

3702
03:11:00,863 --> 03:11:03,423
Also recently I feel relieved

3703

God gave us these people to show us

3713
03:12:01,279 --> 03:12:04,351
What someone only connected to God would look like

3714
03:12:06,911 --> 03:12:07,423
F*** you

The one of these watch all the followers on the betas Washington

3739
03:13:46,495 --> 03:13:49,055
Piece of crap

3740
03:13:52,383 --> 03:13:53,663
Dependent variable

3741
03:13:53,919 --> 03:13:56,223
Cost of sod

3742
03:14:04,415 --> 03:14:08,511
How to spell cute

3743
03:14:28,479 --> 03:14:31,551
Are you

3744
03:14:41,023 --> 03:14:47,167
God will deliver

3745
03:14:52,799 --> 03:14:53,311
He's losing

3746
03:14:56,383 --> 03:14:57,919
So now we've gone through

3747
03:14:59,711 --> 03:15:01,247
The hardest part of the show

3748
03:15:01,759 --> 03:15:03,295
Which which is that

3749
03:15:03,551 --> 03:15:04,575
Like I had like

3750
03:15:04,831 --> 03:15:05,599
14 minutes

3751
03:15:05,855 --> 03:15:06,623
Of his

3752
03:15:06,879 --> 03:15:08,671
Down syndrome analysis

3753
03:15:08,927 --> 03:15:09,951
The weave turned into

3754
03:15:10,207 --> 03:15:10,975
Maybe 40 minutes

3755
03:15:11,231 --> 03:15:11,743
He said

3756
03:15:13,535 --> 03:15:14,815
Not a frustrating

3757
03:15:18,143 --> 03:15:18,911
Do you want to stay on the other

3758
03:15:24,799 --> 03:15:25,311
I think

3759
03:15:25,567 --> 03:15:26,079
I think we've

3760
03:15:26,591 --> 03:15:28,639
Made it clear where we stand

3761
03:15:29,151 --> 03:15:29,663
And I think

3762
03:15:30,431 --> 03:15:32,223
Alex has made it clear

3763
03:15:32,479 --> 03:15:33,503
That

3764
03:15:34,527 --> 03:15:37,343
If anybody should be killed

3765
03:15:38,367 --> 03:15:38,879
It's him

3766
03:15:39,647 --> 03:15:42,463
And he's lying the entire time

3767
03:15:47,327 --> 03:15:49,375
No ice

3768
03:15:49,631 --> 03:15:50,143
I know

3769
03:15:53,471 --> 03:15:53,983
It's

3770
03:15:54,239 --> 03:15:55,519
So amazing

3771
03:15:56,031 --> 03:15:57,567
How

3772
03:15:57,823 --> 03:15:58,847
He is

3773
03:16:01,663 --> 03:16:02,431
It's like he's

3774
03:16:02,687 --> 03:16:03,455
Grabbing this

3775
03:16:03,967 --> 03:16:05,247
This magical

3776
03:16:06,783 --> 03:16:09,599
I don't know all I can think of

3777
03:16:10,111 --> 03:16:11,135
While I hear him

3778
03:16:11,391 --> 03:16:12,159
Save this bowl

3779
03:16:13,439 --> 03:16:14,207
Is

3780
03:16:15,231 --> 03:16:15,743
You don't care

3781
03:16:16,511 --> 03:16:17,023
He doesn't

3782
03:16:17,791 --> 03:16:19,327
No

3783
03:16:19,583 --> 03:16:21,375
Snow White

3784
03:16:21,631 --> 03:16:25,215
This documentary came out a year ago

3785
03:16:25,471 --> 03:16:27,263
Even if it even if the doctor

3786
03:16:27,519 --> 03:16:28,287
The doc came out

3787
03:16:29,823 --> 03:16:30,335
He doesn't care

3788
03:16:31,359 --> 03:16:33,663
It's just like every time workout

3789
03:16:34,175 --> 03:16:35,199
Every time we talked

3790
03:16:35,455 --> 03:16:35,967
Facts about Mash

3791
03:16:37,759 --> 03:16:39,295
The first thought he has is

3792
03:16:39,551 --> 03:16:40,063
How can I use

3793
03:16:41,087 --> 03:16:42,367
And there's no

3794
03:16:42,623 --> 03:16:43,647
Elliptical

3795
03:16:43,903 --> 03:16:44,671
Let's go

3796
03:16:44,927 --> 03:16:51,071
Let's give Dad a Republican

3797
03:16:52,351 --> 03:16:54,399
Our hopes and prayers go out to you

3798
03:16:54,655 --> 03:16:56,447
She's never said that

3799
03:16:56,703 --> 03:16:58,239
Think about mass shootings

3800
03:16:58,495 --> 03:17:00,031
The slightest bit

3801
03:17:00,287 --> 03:17:01,311
Think about mass shootings

3802
03:17:02,079 --> 03:17:05,151
So like he believes like

3803
03:17:05,919 --> 03:17:06,687
He believes

3804
03:17:06,943 --> 03:17:08,223
That the Oklahoma City

3805
03:17:08,479 --> 03:17:08,991
Bombing

3806
03:17:09,247 --> 03:17:09,759
Was

3807
03:17:10,015 --> 03:17:10,527
Fake

3808
03:17:10,783 --> 03:17:12,575
And set up by the globalist

3809
03:17:13,343 --> 03:17:13,855
He believes

3810
03:17:14,111 --> 03:17:17,183
Waco situation was set up

3811
03:17:21,791 --> 03:17:24,607
Let's forget about the fact that he is just

3812
03:17:24,863 --> 03:17:28,703
Forgotten about all of the Sandy Hooks

3813
03:17:28,959 --> 03:17:31,007
Or races in Las Vegas

3814
03:17:31,263 --> 03:17:32,543
Was fake and the knockout game

3815
03:17:32,799 --> 03:17:33,311
Is the biggest problem

3816
03:17:33,567 --> 03:17:35,615
The world

3817
03:17:36,383 --> 03:17:38,431
If you actually believe that

3818
03:17:38,687 --> 03:17:39,199
Any of these

3819
03:17:40,735 --> 03:17:41,247
Prove

3820
03:17:41,503 --> 03:17:42,015
One of them

3821
03:17:42,783 --> 03:17:43,807
One of them

3822
03:17:44,319 --> 03:17:45,087
And then you have

3823
03:17:45,599 --> 03:17:46,111
Droid

3824
03:17:46,367 --> 03:17:47,391
The entire world

3825
03:17:49,183 --> 03:17:51,487
Any of it then

3826
03:17:54,047 --> 03:17:55,839
Yeah right

3827
03:17:56,095 --> 03:17:59,679
Button so much underpinning for society is

3828
03:17:59,935 --> 03:18:01,471
Torn apart

3829
03:18:01,727 --> 03:18:02,751

3830
03:18:03,007 --> 03:18:06,847

Power off air

3833
03:18:14,015 --> 03:18:17,855
Call Justin Watson took over for the 4th hour

3834
03:18:18,111 --> 03:18:20,927
Snarky a lava flow

3835
03:18:24,255 --> 03:18:27,327
Stop now. Always plates

3836
03:18:28,863 --> 03:18:29,887
Vegas shooting

3837
03:18:30,143 --> 03:18:31,935
If I can prove this

3838
03:18:32,191 --> 03:18:32,959
I can prove this

3839
03:18:33,215 --> 03:18:36,799
Dude if he could prove it the only thing we would talk about

3840
03:18:37,055 --> 03:18:37,823
Is that f******

3841
03:18:38,335 --> 03:18:38,847
Absolutely

3842
03:18:39,359 --> 03:18:43,967
Reality I'd be in

3843
03:18:44,479 --> 03:18:48,063
So now I want to give you one more clip

3844
03:18:50,111 --> 03:18:51,135

03:18:51,391 --> 03:18:52,159
Ni

3846
03:18:53,183 --> 03:18:55,487
Look we've been talking about Down syndrome Bundchen

3847
03:18:56,511 --> 03:18:57,535
That to me is

3848
03:18:58,047 --> 03:18:58,559
Disgraceful

3849
03:18:59,839 --> 03:19:00,863
But this life

3850
03:19:01,119 --> 03:19:01,887
Squib gets more

3851
03:19:02,399 --> 03:19:02,911

3852
03:19:03,167 --> 03:19:06,495
I legitimately am now at the point where I think

3853
03:19:09,567 --> 03:19:10,847
I'm done playing games

3854
03:19:11,103 --> 03:19:12,639
Based on this

3855
03:19:14,431 --> 03:19:14,943
Because

3856
03:19:15,967 --> 03:19:16,735

You do I sterilize a politically I say a lot of s***

Yeah you should go to prison

3872

Every single point

3873
03:20:29,439 --> 03:20:30,463
Of the s*** that I've said

3874
03:20:31,231 --> 03:20:31,743
It's been

3875
03:20:31,999 --> 03:20:32,767
Very clear

3876
03:20:33,279 --> 03:20:34,815
Throughout my history

3877
03:20:36,095 --> 03:20:36,863

Contextualize what you say

3882
03:20:47,359 --> 03:20:49,151
I've never I don't really believe

3883
03:20:50,175 --> 03:20:51,967
Like I I can't bring myself

3884
03:20:52,479 --> 03:20:53,503
As much as

3885
03:20:53,759 --> 03:20:56,831
Maybe even I want to I don't think it's the right way to

3886
03:20:57,599 --> 03:20:58,111
Right

3887
03:20:58,367 --> 03:20:59,391
Alex clearly does

3888
03:21:00,159 --> 03:21:04,511
And for a long time it's been unclear whether he believes in

3889
03:21:06,559 --> 03:21:07,071
Yeah

3890
03:21:07,839 --> 03:21:09,375
