And simultaneously I'd like to I think

30
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:46,400
Some of the people who have

31
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:53,312
How about you still being weird Road

32
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,408
I appreciate both of these these responses to people are having

33
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,712

Couldn't do it

41
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:21,728
Too much

42
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:28,128

43
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:30,176

83
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:11,455
I didn't want to put it up on the regular podcast 3 because I felt like it might be over bird

84
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:13,759
People people want it so that's

85
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:17,855

There's now there's a lot of lot of the progress being made here

87
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:27,839
And you know it goes good on the Western Front as they say

88
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:31,679
I got some Whole Foods brand

89
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:34,751
Shelters that come in large glass bottles

90
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:37,567

Bears

96
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:06,751
Elderberry never buy this

97
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:07,775
But I realize

98
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:09,055
I don't know what elderberries

99
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:11,615
I have no idea

100
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:13,151
Could be great could be terrible I don't know

101
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:14,175
Will find out

102
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:16,991
Pineapple passion fruit

103
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:20,575
And I have a slight expectation that that might end up being

104
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:24,671
One of the one of the ones that breaks into the Ada

105
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:29,279
Oh well

106
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:32,351
Pineapple is done

107
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:37,727

108
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:40,543

00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:57,183
Sephora

114
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:58,207
I treat myself

115
00:07:58,463 --> 00:08:01,791
Up to something so wonderful is pineapple

116
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:05,375
10th and 11th

117
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:11,263
Lot of f*****-up nonsense to get through

118
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:12,031
From Jay Chou

119
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:13,823

120
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:19,455
Take me to Everyday pinky taking over the world

121
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:22,783
You bet it is

122
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:29,695
I got excited that

123
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:30,975
Woody's River Roo

124
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:31,999
Even as he gets

125
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:33,023
The quote

126
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,047
Going wrong

127
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:34,815
Yeah

128
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:43,263
Stickler they never actually succeed in taking over the world

129
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:47,103
As far as I recall from my brain

130
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:48,127
Viewing

131
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:58,367
Start on Sunday and Alex number of narratives that he wants to

132
00:08:58,623 --> 00:09:01,695
Do I get busy on in this country

133
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:02,463
Chips

134
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:05,791
Did you know

135
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:07,839
5 years ago in Sweden

136
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:11,423
Free bus ride

137
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:17,567
More than 10

138
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:22,943
Stockholm syndrome named ROM

139
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:23,967
Wow

140
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:25,759
Congrats

141
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:28,319
10000 people I guess that's

142
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:29,343
Come syndrome

143
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:30,111
Dot-com

144
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:32,415
Implantable gym

145
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:35,743
Look at is

146
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:39,071
Look at those little juicy

147
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:41,375
Benjamin Netanyahu says he wants

148
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:42,399
Child in Israel

149
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:44,447
Next year to get chips

150
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:48,287
Elegant agency

151
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:52,383
You're inside the New World Order

152
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:53,407
Just like that

153
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:58,527
So there's some is representations going on here and some irresponsible reporting

154
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:00,575
Snooze a little piece of

155
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:03,391
Did you see

156
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:04,671
That's gross that's kind of

157
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:06,207
Par for the course

158
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:12,351
This guy tells the story about Sweden

159
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:13,631
If you can get free bus ride

160
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:20,543
What he's referring to is a pilot program that a train company called SJ tried in 2017

161
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:22,335
Tips to store their electronic

162
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:23,359
Train tickets

163
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:24,127
On this check

164
00:10:24,895 --> 00:10:28,735
I found an article about this in the independent and this line seems particularly relevant

165
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:32,319
Before you pack your bags for Sweden to steam is only app

166
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:35,391
Already have implants

167
00:10:35,647 --> 00:10:37,183
S.j. is not offering to chip

168
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:41,023
Around 2000 Suites

169
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:42,559
Most of them employed in the check-in

170
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:49,215
Already have a chip

171
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:53,823
Here let's try this out and you guys can try it out never

172
00:10:54,079 --> 00:11:00,223
The biohacking idea took root and start-up companies with the implant being offered to be used as an optional

173
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:00,991
Access building

174
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:04,063
And was specifically designed to not be able to be tracked

175
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:09,183
2017 article in the Washington Post

176
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:10,207
Power supply

177
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:11,999
Can't send signals about its position

178
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:14,815
Obviously their concerns one could have about what

179
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:18,911
The technology could grow into in the future and the challenges presented through the privacy

180
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:23,519
Doesn't seem to be that effective in terms of

181
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:27,359
The Beast that Alex wants to breathe

182
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:33,759
Yeah why

183
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:39,903
2000 people already have implanted train company decided to test if they could use them to store

184
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:43,999
The consumers still has to buy two get two free tickets

185
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:49,119
That's where the chip isn't it

186
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:54,239
They're not chipping people by luring them in with free transportation and if you don't want to get one of these chips

187
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:56,287
There's still tons otherwise goodbye

188
00:11:56,543 --> 00:11:57,055
It's the ride

189
00:11:57,311 --> 00:12:00,383
And I do all the other things that the chip enables you to do like

190
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:01,407
Get into building

191
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:02,687
Lubbock ecard

192
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:09,087
I'm always fascinated by how terrified these people are of a computer chip

193
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:14,207
The phone that can be remotely turned on without their knowledge and record everything that they're saying

194
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:16,255
You know one of those is Boris

195
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:17,535
Moore's more scary

196
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:19,327
Some of these articles about the Swedish

197
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:20,095
Chip thing

198
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:22,655
Clearly bring that point out

199
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:30,847
A July 2019 article New York Post

200
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:39,295
I would assume he's just exaggerating from headlines like quotes

201
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:41,599
The swedes are inserting microchips under their skin

202
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:42,623
From NPR

203
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:44,927
That number is not 10,000 BC

204
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:47,999
Assuming that's what I guess is going on

205
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:49,279
Route number

206
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:53,119
The story about Benjamin Netanyahu his proposed is something completely different

207
00:12:53,887 --> 00:13:00,031
He suggested that is a part of reopening after the coronavirus Israel should put chips in all school children which would that be

208
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:03,103
Beeping noises if I got too close to each other

209
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:04,383
Which presumably would help

210
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:05,663
Looking for some social distance

211
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:08,223
That doesn't sound like a great idea but

212
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:09,247
Okay

213
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:15,647
Expensive roundly rejected the idea saying it's practically on feasible legally impossible

214
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:18,719
Achieve the desired results

215
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:22,815
It seems from what I can tell that this proposal is not going to get off the ground

216
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:28,959
Resilient expert Enoch Mehran in the article

217
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:30,495
Kind of makes clear why

218
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:37,919
Is the information with the kids location is uploaded to the internet a pedophile with some cyber knowledge man

219
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:39,455
Stock them outside their school

220
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:42,271
Distribute the information on other platform

221
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:43,295
Miron said

222
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:45,599
Can the state take responsibility for that

223
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:51,743
Concerns like that system for a state to put in place

224
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:52,767
Until I see evidence

225
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:56,607
To the contrary this kind of seems like a world leader blowing hard

226
00:13:56,863 --> 00:13:59,423
About how they Envision returning to some kind of normalcy

227
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:05,823
And let's not forget that just back in January

228
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:06,847
Three separate corrupt

229
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:07,871
Jim cases

230
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:13,759
These cases are ongoing and since he's been convicted

231
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:14,527
Is prime minister

232
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:17,087
May not go on indefinitely

233
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:18,623
Yep

234
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:21,439
Anyway

235
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:22,719
Here is it

236
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:24,511
These two situations with microchips

237
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:25,535
Completely deaf

238
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:32,447
One of them is a passive chip that's not run by the government and does not track people being used you know

239
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:33,471
Music like a key card

240
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:34,239
Whatever

241
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:35,519
The other is a

242
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:38,591
Suggesting geo-locating chips in children

243
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:43,455
Dishonest have a conversation where you treat these is equivalent to even related things

244
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:44,991
Riley involved microchip

245
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:48,575
Especially since one of them took me all the four-second

246
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:49,343
Can stew be like

247
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:51,135
That's a terrible idea

248
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:59,327
Very easy to know that nobody's going to follow through on netanyahu's ridiculous nonsense

249
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:08,287
You can have a conversation about how like the idea of this weekend

250
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:09,567
Programmatic

251
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:13,407
Facilitator

252
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:16,223
Jordans that conversation by all means

253
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:18,527
Talk about it

254
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:19,807
It's not even close

255
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:20,575
Do the same thing

256
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:22,367
As what

257
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:26,207
Just makes them the same thing

258
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:27,999
So

259
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:30,559
Dokken

260
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:31,839
Nothing love

261
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:33,887
I'll tell you what I mean

262
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:34,911
It's impressive

263
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:36,703
The old

264
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:37,983
Vikings

265
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:39,263
A lot of the Viking tribe

266
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:40,799
When a man die

267
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:49,759
Alright

268
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:55,391
A ship and send them out the water on

269
00:15:57,695 --> 00:15:58,463
Call Halla together

270
00:15:58,975 --> 00:15:59,487
I'm listening

271
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:04,095
That netanyahu's idea

272
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:05,631
Why do people a

273
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:10,495
Call Sharonda

274
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:16,383
Just to be clear Alex's reason for the cultures all doing this

275
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:22,783
Because interdimensional demons are compensated for their pleasure or something

276
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:27,647
Unfortunately this appears to be yet another thing that I was selling a movie and decided to call

277
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:28,415
Deep research

278
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:35,327
For one thing Viking funerals at see we're absolutely not the standard form

279
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:41,983
You can easily see how absurdly expensive that would be calm if you were making boats and burning them it's easy for every person who died

280
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:43,007
Infinite resources

281
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:50,687
There were some people who have funeral pyres in boats on the sea

282
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:51,455
Really important

283
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:52,223
Certain people

284
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:58,879
The different groups that are all lumped in his liking we're not uniform culture but most people were cremated or just buried

285
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:03,487
Typically a really important symbol in their culture representing

286
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:07,327
Play passage to the afterlife

287
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:10,911
Or even cooler their burial mounds be made to resemble ships

288
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:11,679
Themselves

289
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:12,959
That is fun

290
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:19,359
This was far more common than the funeral at sea but the funeral

291
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:20,639
Besides it's starting

292
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:28,063
This

293
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:34,207
Put on a boat

294
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:36,767
It actually started in the 1958 film the bike

295
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:39,327
Has been a really popular truck ever since then

296
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:40,095
It is

297
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:40,863
Really

298
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:42,655
I mean listening

299
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:45,727
Is really cool

300
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:48,031
Even hit it so far away

301
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:52,895
So what are the difficulties on this subject is the actual written history of the record about

302
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:59,295
People's is limited precise reasons were for why they did the things they did

303
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:00,575
In terms of funeral ritual

304
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:01,599
It's a really

305
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:04,159
Diverse set of funeral rituals

306
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:05,183
Seem to involve

307
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:06,463
Chaos

308
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:10,303
I know exactly what was going on

309
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:14,655
They're up there may have been some instances where of Norsemen being buried with their wives

310
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:15,935
Like murdered you know

311
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:19,263
But was far more common was them killing slaves

312
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:22,335
To be buried with a person to help them on their trip to the afterlife

313
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:26,431
Which is company unfortunately do see a lot of older cultures

314
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:31,807
Also there's no reason for Alex just to think that women were property in Viking communities

315
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:34,879
Archaeological evidence

316
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:35,647
Not property

317
00:18:41,023 --> 00:18:42,815
And that's allowed to have to have some sort of

318
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:43,839
Autonomous life

319
00:18:44,607 --> 00:18:49,727
Additionally in 1904 the remains of the Ellsberg ship were found in vestfold Norway

320
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:53,567
The ship was a funeral vessel which served as a burial site for two

321
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:56,383
Norse women who died around 8:34 Cee

322
00:18:57,151 --> 00:18:59,455
Disappear like a particularly large boat casket

323
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:03,039
70 ft long 17 ft wide and 30 ft High

324
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:04,831
Forgive the strong evidence

325
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:08,159
Position in their community

326
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:09,951
Possible

327
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:11,743
Because he's only see movies and TV shows

328
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:17,375
Cuz that's where the Viking you should have asked

329
00:19:17,631 --> 00:19:19,423
Marley bird about

330
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:20,959
Gallagher love it

331
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:25,311
This is not to say that

332
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:27,359
Finger probably

333
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:28,127
Just flipping

334
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:31,455
Perspective

335
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:35,039
It just watch some TV and movies

336
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:37,855
This is nonsense

337
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:40,671
You could not tell you whether or not

338
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:42,207
A ship

339
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:42,975
All of it

340
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:43,999
Parts have been ripped

341
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:44,767
Flexed

342
00:19:45,023 --> 00:19:47,071
Interesting philosophical question

343
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:49,631
Sure and also there's one

344
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:50,655
So there's that too

345
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:53,215
Askew

346
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:54,239
If

347
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:56,031
You're Alex Jones

348
00:19:56,287 --> 00:19:58,591
You're circling the drain desperately

349
00:19:58,847 --> 00:20:00,127
And things are falling apart

350
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:03,455
Michael Wright

351
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:04,735
Follow through with

352
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:06,015
Plan that you had

353
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:08,575
Before the virus outbreak

354
00:20:09,087 --> 00:20:11,135
Where you start talking more about Seth

355
00:20:12,927 --> 00:20:15,231
Can't think of any reason why not

356
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:24,703
Can I say has Seth rich and Wikileaks attorney Klein

357
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:35,455
Y'all know it

358
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:36,735
Was

359
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:38,015
The Laker

360
00:20:38,527 --> 00:20:40,063
So the story here is

361
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:42,111
Is that name.

362
00:20:42,623 --> 00:20:45,951
Clevenger

363
00:20:46,207 --> 00:20:47,231
The claims regarding 7

364
00:20:47,487 --> 00:20:47,999
Mercedes van

365
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:49,279
Substantiating anyway

366
00:20:49,535 --> 00:20:50,047
Corduroy

367
00:20:50,303 --> 00:20:55,423
His first claim is that he's been told that the NSA or other related agencies are in possession of communication

368
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:56,959
Between Seth rich and WikiLeaks

369
00:20:57,727 --> 00:21:01,311
There's no evidence provided for this claim never stopped Alex from believe in something

370
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:02,079
Before

371
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:08,223
Clevenger he claims several high-ranking FBI and NSA officials have seen the correspondence

372
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:08,991
Between Bridge

373
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:10,527
And Wikileaks first

374
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:11,551
To which I say

375
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:17,696
Prove it probably

376
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:18,720
He's probably talk about

377
00:21:19,744 --> 00:21:22,304
Clevenger goes on to claim that he has

378
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,096
Seymour Hersh

379
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:27,424
Clients and claiming that he spoke to someone at the FBI

380
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,216
Confirm emails between rich and Wiki

381
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:36,128
This recording is not available in the Infowars article

382
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:38,432
To this I say let's see that audio

383
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:43,808
Because I have found somebody

384
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:50,464
It related to this topic someone

385
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:51,488
1

386
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:56,864
This guy needs to put up

387
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:03,264
This what I'm saying I think he's one of those guys probably

388
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,032
I don't need to put a

389
00:22:04,544 --> 00:22:05,568
So this seems to be a

390
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:06,592
Conspiracy theorist

391
00:22:06,848 --> 00:22:10,688
Threads it existed from the beginning

392
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:14,272
Seymour Hersh thing was a claim that goes back to at least 27

393
00:22:14,528 --> 00:22:16,576
Debunked

394
00:22:17,344 --> 00:22:17,856
What are the odds

395
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:19,392
Conspiracist

396
00:22:19,648 --> 00:22:22,464
Ed butowsky was a trump associate donor

397
00:22:23,488 --> 00:22:25,280
Became convinced of the FBI

398
00:22:25,536 --> 00:22:29,120
Including the Seth riches

399
00:22:29,376 --> 00:22:31,936
After speaking to the legendary reporter Seymour Hersh

400
00:22:32,192 --> 00:22:33,728
Who was also investigating Richard

401
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:34,496
Is that

402
00:22:34,752 --> 00:22:39,872
According to the transcript to confirm the report

403
00:22:40,384 --> 00:22:42,176
That's for me 2017 thing

404
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:45,248
NPR interview verse about this and he said

405
00:22:45,504 --> 00:22:46,272
I hear gossip

406
00:22:46,528 --> 00:22:48,832
Petoskey took two into inmate 45 out of

407
00:22:50,624 --> 00:22:51,392
Alright

408
00:22:51,648 --> 00:22:52,672
This misrepresentation

409
00:22:52,928 --> 00:22:57,792
Universe was passed from Petoskey to Fox News

410
00:22:58,304 --> 00:22:58,816
Which ended

411
00:22:59,072 --> 00:23:01,888
In lawsuit

412
00:23:02,144 --> 00:23:03,168
Define smelling like a rose

413
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:09,568
Exactly clevenger's.

414
00:23:09,824 --> 00:23:15,200
Vlog

415
00:23:15,712 --> 00:23:16,736
Fflogs La Flaca

416
00:23:18,784 --> 00:23:21,600
Another reason that I'm kind of worried about clevenger's work is

417
00:23:21,856 --> 00:23:26,720
Because he also said in this post about the Seth Rich stuff

418
00:23:26,976 --> 00:23:28,512
Back to the NSA

419
00:23:29,024 --> 00:23:35,168
Former NSA officials Bill Binney at Loomis and Kirk wiebe or prepare to testify

420
00:23:35,424 --> 00:23:36,960
Could not have been

421
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:38,240
Obtain

422
00:23:39,264 --> 00:23:41,312
Is it a huge problem because build in his walk

423
00:23:41,568 --> 00:23:42,080
Back that quick

424
00:23:42,592 --> 00:23:43,360
From everything I can

425
00:23:43,616 --> 00:23:44,384
He would not tell

426
00:23:45,664 --> 00:23:47,712
Because he was about

427
00:23:48,736 --> 00:23:49,504
Wheatley wrong

428
00:23:50,016 --> 00:23:52,320
This again is another element of these claims being made by

429
00:23:52,576 --> 00:23:54,368
Clevenger that just the old separate

430
00:23:54,624 --> 00:23:56,160
Conspiracy ship.

431
00:23:56,416 --> 00:23:59,488
And pretending that it all hasn't already been discredited

432
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:00,768
This is pretty sad

433
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:05,120
My time watching Howard Pretenders new information

434
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:11,520
Careful though because this is a topic that has led to a number of people being sued already

435
00:24:11,776 --> 00:24:15,360
And the family of separate does not seem thrilled people are

436
00:24:15,616 --> 00:24:20,480
Keeping this alive in his situation though part of him must be like

437
00:24:21,248 --> 00:24:22,016
What else do you got

438
00:24:22,272 --> 00:24:24,064
Bugaloos

439
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,856
Join the fun

440
00:24:26,112 --> 00:24:27,648
Club

441
00:24:27,904 --> 00:24:31,744
You're going to be the last one to sue me if I have any money left at the end

442
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:38,144
You still might be able to get a little press out of maybe I can

443
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,960
Make a arrangements or something

444
00:24:41,472 --> 00:24:42,752
I can saddle

445
00:24:43,264 --> 00:24:45,056
Whatever

446
00:24:45,312 --> 00:24:48,640
Jangling Keys away from his guy being the worst human being on the

447
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:51,712
He doesn't want to

448
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:53,760
No and one way is he

449
00:24:54,016 --> 00:24:56,064
You know distracted attention

450
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,600
Understand

451
00:24:58,112 --> 00:25:01,952
Episode is one of the rare instances where Alex is throwing

452
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:07,584
Spaghetti at the wall

453
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:08,352
See what we can

454
00:25:08,864 --> 00:25:14,496
Course A lot of it does Dylan Coronavirus denialism

455
00:25:15,008 --> 00:25:18,336
That is you know

456
00:25:18,592 --> 00:25:19,360
The craft the Giant

457
00:25:19,616 --> 00:25:20,128
Conspiracy is

458
00:25:20,384 --> 00:25:22,432
Of course Bill Gates's

459
00:25:22,944 --> 00:25:24,224
060606

460
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:27,296
Right right right

461
00:25:27,808 --> 00:25:30,368
Unfortunately the number 6 has come back up

462
00:25:30,624 --> 00:25:31,904
In another place

463
00:25:32,672 --> 00:25:33,952
Congress bill

464
00:25:34,208 --> 00:25:35,488

00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:42,912
The gentleman

467
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:44,448
Let me give you

468
00:25:45,984 --> 00:25:47,008
The bill number

469
00:25:48,544 --> 00:25:49,056
6

470
00:25:49,568 --> 00:25:50,080
6

471
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:51,360
6

472
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:54,944
Now that's one too many buddy

473
00:25:59,552 --> 00:26:01,088
060606

474
00:26:02,624 --> 00:26:03,648
Bracelet

475
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:10,304
I got to say that it's satisfying all the satanic actually ever 66

476
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:15,168
I know I understand the bill numbers just sixes but it's not 666

477
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:21,056
That patent filing number to may have been 060606 that is not 666

478
00:26:21,568 --> 00:26:24,896
Is the number of the Beast is 666 that isn't Revelation saying

479
00:26:25,152 --> 00:26:30,784
Hey weirdo look out for numbers that remind you of

480
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:31,808
Insects

481
00:26:32,064 --> 00:26:38,208
6666666 and I reject some lazy level of death

482
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:44,608
The devil is fungible is always willing to play a little game around

483
00:26:44,864 --> 00:26:46,144
Suggestion

00:26:46,912 --> 00:26:47,424

Go see an acupuncturist

492
00:27:19,168 --> 00:27:20,448
Who was fighting the devil

00:27:33,248 --> 00:27:37,600
The bill to authorize the Secretary of the Interior the grant to States and local governments

Birth control and prevention of flooded

That's

505
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,680
Exactly like

506
00:27:51,936 --> 00:27:54,752
Did you choose to hear about that level of evil

507
00:27:55,008 --> 00:27:56,544
Easements

Is 6666 is basically just 666 scouring phone number

512
00:28:08,576 --> 00:28:14,720
Shades of devil worship

513
00:28:14,976 --> 00:28:15,744
But it was phone number is

514
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:16,768
Suspiciously

515
00:28:17,024 --> 00:28:19,072
969 6666

516
00:28:19,328 --> 00:28:24,704
That's an extra 6729 there's basically upside-down sixes

517
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:25,472
This thing goes

518
00:28:25,984 --> 00:28:28,288
Realize how deep

519
00:28:28,544 --> 00:28:29,568
You know you know

520
00:28:29,824 --> 00:28:35,968
They're even pockets of satanists in the world of early 1900s Texas Rangers how else could you possibly explain that one

521
00:28:36,224 --> 00:28:37,248
What's the most famous Rams

522
00:28:37,504 --> 00:28:41,344
King County Texas is literally named D 6666 Ranch

523
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,880
He's close

524
00:28:46,208 --> 00:28:48,768
I sent a little bit of personal

525
00:28:54,144 --> 00:28:57,216
Yeah

526
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:01,056
So house resolutions are numbered in the order they're introduced

527
00:29:01,312 --> 00:29:04,896
6665 resolution

528
00:29:05,152 --> 00:29:05,920
Pop up

529
00:29:06,432 --> 00:29:08,480
You're not to get a sick sick sick sick

530
00:29:08,736 --> 00:29:09,760
Legit means nothing

531
00:29:10,272 --> 00:29:13,600
Bill 6666 in the 2007/2008 session

532
00:29:13,856 --> 00:29:16,928
Congress is actually support

533
00:29:17,184 --> 00:29:19,744
Quotes

534
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,048
The greenhouse gases are not subject to the bill

535
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:23,840
I bet that number would become

536
00:29:27,168 --> 00:29:28,704
Yeah that one actually does sound

537
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:29,728
66c to me

538
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:34,592
Ordered this year you know there was already a bill 666 right that happened already

539
00:29:37,664 --> 00:29:38,944
I don't know what I was thinking

540
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:39,968
The stupid numerology

541
00:29:40,224 --> 00:29:42,784
Want to play

542
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,064
I guess he's free to

543
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:49,952
He just looks pretty f****** embarrassing from where I'm sitting

544
00:29:50,208 --> 00:29:54,816
Quote to authorize the Secretary of Health and Human Services

545
00:29:55,072 --> 00:29:56,608
These to conduct diagnostic test

546
00:29:56,864 --> 00:29:57,376
Sing for covid-19

547
00:29:57,888 --> 00:30:03,008
And related activities such as contact tracing units and is necessary at

548
00:30:03,264 --> 00:30:04,288
Individuals residence

549
00:30:04,544 --> 00:30:05,568
And for other purposes

550
00:30:06,336 --> 00:30:07,104
Let's pause there

551
00:30:08,896 --> 00:30:09,408
When is authorizing

552
00:30:09,664 --> 00:30:11,456
Secretary of HHS to give G

553
00:30:12,224 --> 00:30:15,808
I was just realize the Trump gets to decide who the Secretary of HHS

554
00:30:16,832 --> 00:30:17,856
The Deep state

555
00:30:18,112 --> 00:30:19,904
This is a presidential appointed position

556
00:30:22,208 --> 00:30:22,976
Currently in that role

557
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:25,792
If this were some kind of a nefarious thing or this bill was meant

558
00:30:26,048 --> 00:30:26,816
Facilitate you

559
00:30:27,072 --> 00:30:30,656
It literally could only be done by the action of the person Trump hired and

560
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:34,752
Could fire unless they're blackmailing Alex Azar

561
00:30:35,264 --> 00:30:35,776
Already

562
00:30:36,032 --> 00:30:41,152
After just the first line of attack you can see how any conspiracy about this is mostly

563
00:30:41,408 --> 00:30:42,944
Not on content

564
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,224
Who's very short film

565
00:30:46,016 --> 00:30:49,344
He's going to complain about like some news article being four pages long

566
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,112
It's not like

567
00:30:50,368 --> 00:30:52,160
He's a guy who likes primary information

568
00:30:52,928 --> 00:30:53,440
If you read this

569
00:30:53,696 --> 00:30:58,304
It's pretty clear that what this bill is about is allowing Secretary of Health and Human Services

570
00:30:59,584 --> 00:31:00,608
Eligible organizations

571
00:31:00,864 --> 00:31:03,936
Increasing artistic capacity

572
00:31:04,192 --> 00:31:04,704
Conceivable

573
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:07,264
To return safely to something resembling normal

574
00:31:07,776 --> 00:31:11,872
The part about doing in-home testing Debbie something

575
00:31:12,128 --> 00:31:15,456
We could do this already

576
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:17,248
You can imagine

577
00:31:17,504 --> 00:31:20,576
How much better is system it would be easy to get reliable testing at home

578
00:31:20,832 --> 00:31:23,392
As opposed to thinking you might be sick

579
00:31:24,928 --> 00:31:25,696
If doing so is a risk

580
00:31:25,952 --> 00:31:26,464
The others

581
00:31:26,976 --> 00:31:30,048
This whole conspiracy is a lot of bulshit and at this point I'm weary

582
00:31:30,304 --> 00:31:30,816
I'm just weary

583
00:31:32,608 --> 00:31:36,960
To create the appearance of something

584
00:31:37,216 --> 00:31:42,848
It sounds like something I didn't see that

585
00:31:43,104 --> 00:31:44,128
Give them a Grinch

586
00:31:44,384 --> 00:31:49,248
2 people who will break into your home and test you for a disease I think that's

587
00:31:49,504 --> 00:31:50,016
That's a great idea

588
00:31:50,272 --> 00:31:51,040
I don't

589
00:31:51,296 --> 00:31:53,600
I don't think they put forcibly in that go

590
00:31:53,856 --> 00:31:56,416
Think so

591
00:31:56,928 --> 00:31:59,232
Hyzaar could stop it

592
00:31:59,744 --> 00:32:03,072
You could just say I'm not going to

593
00:32:12,288 --> 00:32:13,824
Problem-solve

594
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:17,408
Even if you're evil pocket version

595
00:32:17,664 --> 00:32:23,040
You have the Ace of Spades to play pretty sure everybody

596
00:32:23,552 --> 00:32:24,832
Everyone's in on it

597
00:32:25,088 --> 00:32:25,856
So tired

598
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:30,208
You know how like hotels don't have 13 floors

599
00:32:30,464 --> 00:32:32,000
Superstitious

600
00:32:32,256 --> 00:32:38,400
Get rid of these Bill numbers that are weird 420

601
00:32:42,496 --> 00:32:44,032
Bill 69.1

602
00:32:47,104 --> 00:32:48,384
Yeah we got to do something cuz these

603
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:49,152
Dum Dums

604
00:32:49,408 --> 00:32:51,712
I just can't handle things

605
00:32:52,736 --> 00:32:55,552
Alex Wassabi Coronavirus

606
00:32:55,808 --> 00:32:57,856
Conspiracy to ramble about in this line

607
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:01,184
Baby dumber than some of those others

608
00:33:04,768 --> 00:33:05,792
President is

609
00:33:06,304 --> 00:33:07,328
Neurologist

610
00:33:23,968 --> 00:33:24,480
Everything that's fine

611
00:33:27,552 --> 00:33:30,368
Presidents named John

612
00:33:30,624 --> 00:33:33,952
Anther is

613
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:36,000
Top biology

614
00:33:36,256 --> 00:33:40,096
Doctor in chemistry which is not biology

615
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:44,704
I have no idea what else is claiming he's invented and now it's isn't specific about it

616
00:33:48,032 --> 00:33:49,312
Is a viral meme that

617
00:33:49,568 --> 00:33:53,664
It's been going around about Michael Cooley claiming that he sent a sample of

618
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:55,456
Quail

619
00:33:55,712 --> 00:33:57,504
For covid-19 and they came back positive

620
00:33:58,272 --> 00:34:03,904
There's been absolutely no evidence provided to back up his claim

621
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:05,952
Is currently facing a great deal of pressure

622
00:34:06,208 --> 00:34:08,256
Over his handling of the virus

623
00:34:08,512 --> 00:34:14,656
Whole lot like something someone would say they were earlier

624
00:34:14,912 --> 00:34:19,008
Maybe some more replicating

625
00:34:19,264 --> 00:34:20,800
Controlled environment I think

626
00:34:21,056 --> 00:34:23,872
Probably a Tanzanian president talkingshit

627
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:27,200
Also Alex should definitely not like

628
00:34:30,016 --> 00:34:32,320
2018 article in the mail & Guardian

629
00:34:32,576 --> 00:34:37,440
Discusses his government

630
00:34:37,696 --> 00:34:38,208
Assaulted

631
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:40,768
Kidnap hit with papayas all over

632
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:44,608
In 2017 began operation

633
00:34:44,864 --> 00:34:45,888
There were not to his liking

634
00:34:46,144 --> 00:34:50,496
Including five prominent TV stations and the Swahili language

635
00:34:51,264 --> 00:34:54,080
He introduced a $920 license for the government

636
00:34:54,336 --> 00:34:56,896
Required to obtain to be able to post things online

637
00:34:57,152 --> 00:34:58,176
Licenses that the government

638
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:03,552
If the writers post content that they disapprove of us just to protect against fake news down

639
00:35:03,808 --> 00:35:05,856
And then there were these threats to have

640
00:35:06,112 --> 00:35:08,928
Anti-government protesters beaten like stray dogs

641
00:35:09,184 --> 00:35:10,208
Just forget

642
00:35:10,464 --> 00:35:16,096
Displeasure with the way the government was operated

643
00:35:16,352 --> 00:35:17,120
Everything Alex

644
00:35:17,376 --> 00:35:18,656
Pretends is happening in the US

645
00:35:18,912 --> 00:35:22,240
Because he's not allowed on Twitter actually is happening to journalists and activists

646
00:35:22,496 --> 00:35:23,008
Tanzania

647
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,056
He doesn't know any of that s*** and he doesn't care

648
00:35:25,312 --> 00:35:29,152
This guy came out and said something useful for Alex's Coronavirus

649
00:35:29,408 --> 00:35:33,504
So he's not only a great president

650
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:36,064
Troubleshoot means anything

651
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:37,600
0 works

652
00:35:37,856 --> 00:35:38,624
To go from

653
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:45,024
Nothing to top biologist

654
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:48,608
Fun for Alex to use and guess what you just got a promotion

655
00:35:48,864 --> 00:35:49,632
The top biology

656
00:35:50,144 --> 00:35:55,776
Alex gave Nobel Prize

657
00:35:56,288 --> 00:36:02,432
If you have any publisher you're not working for a prestigious universe

658
00:36:02,688 --> 00:36:04,992
University

659
00:36:05,248 --> 00:36:08,832
Blog post

660
00:36:09,344 --> 00:36:11,904
Ever winner of the Nobel Prize in literature

661
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:12,672
Sure

662
00:36:12,928 --> 00:36:14,976
So there's been some trouble going on in the world

663
00:36:15,232 --> 00:36:18,304
A real the real world as they call it

664
00:36:18,816 --> 00:36:21,632
With some cases of the virus

665
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:22,400
Meat Packing

666
00:36:22,656 --> 00:36:25,984
Robust conversation

667
00:36:26,496 --> 00:36:27,520
Alex

668
00:36:31,872 --> 00:36:32,896
300 +

669
00:36:37,248 --> 00:36:38,528
2000

670
00:36:39,552 --> 00:36:40,320
Blood test positive

671
00:36:40,576 --> 00:36:41,344
Not one God

672
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:42,112
Fever

673
00:36:45,952 --> 00:36:46,976
Symptomatic

674
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,024
You're so smart

675
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:49,792
Of course

676
00:36:50,048 --> 00:36:50,560
Deposit

677
00:36:51,328 --> 00:36:52,096
So smart

678
00:36:57,728 --> 00:36:58,240
Tyson plant

679
00:36:58,496 --> 00:36:59,520
On September 19th

680
00:37:00,032 --> 00:37:02,592
The story of

681
00:37:02,848 --> 00:37:06,944
Complaint tested positive doesn't actually make the argument Alex's claiming it does

682
00:37:07,456 --> 00:37:07,968
41

683
00:37:10,016 --> 00:37:14,624
The last decade or whatever wide 300 out of 2010's positive

684
00:37:15,136 --> 00:37:20,000
Introducing the idea that some tests are always being positive and some additional Eric

685
00:37:20,256 --> 00:37:23,840
I don't think I was ready or able to prove at all

686
00:37:24,352 --> 00:37:25,120
I'm not positive

687
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:27,424
Exactly what planet he's talking about unfortunate

688
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:28,448
Because there were a number

689
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:30,496
Number of situations

690
00:37:31,008 --> 00:37:33,824
Similar to this or Longview

691
00:37:34,336 --> 00:37:36,384
Do you talkin about a Tyson plant that's

692
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:37,152
For sure

693
00:37:38,176 --> 00:37:44,320
To tell you the Business Insider reported on Monday that 585 Tyson workers and 15th

694
00:37:44,576 --> 00:37:45,344
Shapes of a diagnosis

695
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:46,368
Covid-19

696
00:37:46,624 --> 00:37:47,904
And 18 have died

697
00:37:48,672 --> 00:37:51,744
That's the reality that Alex is sitting at the propaganda as a Meredith

698
00:37:52,256 --> 00:37:53,792
It's pretty important not to lose sight of that

699
00:37:54,048 --> 00:37:55,072
These arguments are ghoulish

700
00:37:55,328 --> 00:37:56,864
And even if the numbers are accurate

701
00:37:57,376 --> 00:37:59,168
They don't make the Casey thinks they do

702
00:37:59,424 --> 00:38:00,192
Now does not make sense

703
00:38:00,448 --> 00:38:01,216
Now these this

704
00:38:01,472 --> 00:38:01,984
Insane

705
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:02,752
These people are

706
00:38:03,264 --> 00:38:06,080
Tyson plant

707
00:38:06,336 --> 00:38:06,848
Here

708
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:09,152
Later in the episode we find out

709
00:38:09,664 --> 00:38:11,200
He thinks it's the same thing

710
00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:12,480
As a port

711
00:38:12,736 --> 00:38:14,016
Plant in Missouri

712
00:38:14,272 --> 00:38:15,552
Which isn't run by Tyson

713
00:38:15,808 --> 00:38:18,112
Is the story that was about a plant that was run by

714
00:38:18,368 --> 00:38:19,136
Triumph Foods

715
00:38:19,648 --> 00:38:21,696
Alex conveniently ignores

716
00:38:21,952 --> 00:38:23,232
Update about that story when he

717
00:38:23,488 --> 00:38:24,000
Covers

718
00:38:28,864 --> 00:38:29,376
Not that

719
00:38:29,888 --> 00:38:35,008
I was just hanging on the asymptomatic thing here to argue that none of these who are actually sick and it's all a charade

720
00:38:35,264 --> 00:38:35,776
I feel like

721
00:38:36,032 --> 00:38:37,568
If this guy who's unidentified

722
00:38:37,824 --> 00:38:40,896
The story is that

723
00:38:41,664 --> 00:38:42,176
Maybe this

724
00:38:43,968 --> 00:38:44,992
Way to do it

725
00:38:45,504 --> 00:38:46,016
Yep

726
00:38:46,272 --> 00:38:46,784
Possible

727
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:52,160
Join the class action lawsuit that will eventually I assume

728
00:38:52,416 --> 00:38:53,440
Tyranny of the United

729
00:38:53,696 --> 00:38:59,840
States of America

730
00:39:08,032 --> 00:39:08,800
Why not

731
00:39:09,568 --> 00:39:13,152
Make it a slap Alex gets slapped suits against everybody

732
00:39:16,736 --> 00:39:19,808
Do in this next clip Alex discusses how like you know

733
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:20,832
Virus

734
00:39:22,112 --> 00:39:23,392
That is all we need

735
00:39:23,648 --> 00:39:24,160
The focus on

736
00:39:24,416 --> 00:39:24,928
Sure

737
00:39:26,208 --> 00:39:27,744
That means

738
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,024
Left by the wayside

739
00:39:35,168 --> 00:39:36,192
Will you ever understand

740
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:37,472
That this

741
00:39:37,984 --> 00:39:40,288
Covid-19 thing is the launch of the New Order take

742
00:39:41,824 --> 00:39:43,104
Everything else is just a side

743
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:44,384
Issue I mean

744
00:39:46,432 --> 00:39:47,456
Police report said that

745
00:39:47,712 --> 00:39:48,992
Somebody

746
00:39:49,248 --> 00:39:49,760
No

747
00:39:51,552 --> 00:39:52,320
Feeling four-wheelers

748
00:40:00,768 --> 00:40:01,280
Force

749
00:40:06,912 --> 00:40:09,472
Robin house

750
00:40:13,056 --> 00:40:15,104
You got to go to prison for what they did probably not

751
00:40:18,432 --> 00:40:23,296
Some of the details of the shooting of Ahmad Arbury

752
00:40:23,552 --> 00:40:25,600
It does seem like a lot of

753
00:40:25,856 --> 00:40:27,136
Details around this one

754
00:40:30,976 --> 00:40:36,096
Kind of sounds like he's describing a police shooting of somebody who was suspected

755
00:40:36,864 --> 00:40:37,632
That's not the case

756
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:40,448
In reality Aubrey was shot by Travis McMichael

757
00:40:40,704 --> 00:40:43,008
Who's used to be a cop but is not anymore

758
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:48,384
Michael and his dad chase down

759
00:40:48,896 --> 00:40:49,664
This was not

760
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:52,480
Excessive lethal Force being used by police

761
00:40:53,504 --> 00:40:54,784
/ appeals to racism

762
00:40:55,552 --> 00:40:59,136
In the police report the Elder McMichael claimed that he saw arbore out jog

763
00:40:59,392 --> 00:41:00,672
Must be a burglar

764
00:41:01,184 --> 00:41:01,952
This makes sense

765
00:41:02,208 --> 00:41:05,792
Considering that he wasn't carrying anything

766
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:13,984
McMichael stated the unidentified male began to violently attacked Travis and the two men then started fighting over the shock

767
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:17,824
Travis fired a shot

768
00:41:18,848 --> 00:41:22,688
This story is contradicted by video that have been released of the altercation

769
00:41:22,944 --> 00:41:25,504
Which clearly shows arbore trying to jog around McMichael

770
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:27,552
Truck

771
00:41:28,064 --> 00:41:29,600
Immediately after that you see Travis

772
00:41:29,856 --> 00:41:30,880
McMichael outside the truck

773
00:41:31,136 --> 00:41:32,416
Can a bit of a lock-up with arbery

774
00:41:32,672 --> 00:41:34,208
After which there are two more shots

775
00:41:35,488 --> 00:41:36,768
The varying timeline of events

776
00:41:37,024 --> 00:41:40,352
Are number of shots between McMichaels version of the story and the video

777
00:41:40,608 --> 00:41:42,656
Isn't that I find particularly troubling

778
00:41:43,168 --> 00:41:47,264
And effective McMichael is a former cop leads me to believe that he should have know a lot of

779
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:49,312
Training in the field of reporting events

780
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:53,663
It's one thing for a random person in the Heat of the Moment to get some major details wrong

781
00:41:53,919 --> 00:41:54,431
It does happen

782
00:41:54,943 --> 00:41:56,479
It's something else entirely for a

783
00:41:56,735 --> 00:41:57,503
Former cop

784
00:41:58,015 --> 00:41:59,551
To get basic details

785
00:41:59,807 --> 00:42:00,575
Of an event

786
00:42:00,831 --> 00:42:06,975
Wrong

787
00:42:08,255 --> 00:42:13,375
That's so it's surprising

788
00:42:13,631 --> 00:42:14,399
Text until May

789
00:42:14,911 --> 00:42:18,495
Then on May 9th videos released it appeared to show Arbor

790
00:42:18,751 --> 00:42:21,311
House under construction

791
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:28,223
This video has been used by all the races

792
00:42:28,479 --> 00:42:28,991
Rights to kill him

793
00:42:29,503 --> 00:42:33,087
Personally I've done way worse things are construction sites Never Killed Me Over

794
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:36,415
Disclosure

795
00:42:36,671 --> 00:42:38,719
Midwest

796
00:42:38,975 --> 00:42:41,535
I think they're there might be a fairly common

797
00:42:41,791 --> 00:42:43,327
Experience of f****** around on

798
00:42:44,863 --> 00:42:45,887
I was really hoping

799
00:42:47,167 --> 00:42:47,679
This one

800
00:42:49,215 --> 00:42:50,751
Repair

801
00:42:51,007 --> 00:42:55,615
Cuz this one is simple litmus test for whether or not you're a giant

802
00:42:58,943 --> 00:43:04,063
Because Aubrey looked around a house under construction the McMichaels had probable cause

803
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:05,343
How to do a citizen's arrest

804
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:06,879
But that doesn't really make sense

805
00:43:07,391 --> 00:43:09,183
They didn't actually see him commit any crime

806
00:43:10,719 --> 00:43:11,487
Flimsy defense

807
00:43:11,743 --> 00:43:12,255
Answer I think

808
00:43:12,767 --> 00:43:14,815
What can you do we make sense

809
00:43:15,071 --> 00:43:19,935
Curious person looking around in a cool down on their job

810
00:43:20,191 --> 00:43:23,519
It's hard not to think that a racial component has something to do

811
00:43:24,031 --> 00:43:28,127
Even if the McMichaels weren't acting from place of racism two people bending over backwards

812
00:43:29,151 --> 00:43:30,431
People like Millie Weaver certain

813
00:43:31,967 --> 00:43:35,551
So much this is a horrible tragedy and there is an investigation going on

814
00:43:35,807 --> 00:43:37,087
What's the matter and we'll see what happens

815
00:43:38,367 --> 00:43:42,975
For now I want you to take note of Alex discusses this case

816
00:43:43,231 --> 00:43:43,743
After month

817
00:43:43,999 --> 00:43:47,327
Yelling about how Katie steinle was murdered because she was white

818
00:43:48,351 --> 00:43:49,375
Couldn't stand

819
00:43:50,911 --> 00:43:54,751
Think about how Alex promoted rallies against immigration in the name of steinly

820
00:43:55,007 --> 00:43:56,799
And set Owen Shroyer out to cover them

821
00:43:57,311 --> 00:44:02,687
It's important to recognize these differences because they are the places you see Alex's racism on full display

822
00:44:03,199 --> 00:44:06,783
He's too sappy to say the n-word or talk about hating on white people

823
00:44:07,295 --> 00:44:08,575
You can see clearly how he

824
00:44:08,831 --> 00:44:11,391
Differently he engages with situations depending on the

825
00:44:11,647 --> 00:44:12,415
Races involved

826
00:44:12,927 --> 00:44:14,975
If there's a case of a non-white person accidentally

827
00:44:15,231 --> 00:44:18,047
Discharging a gun in the bullet ricocheted and hits a white woman

828
00:44:18,559 --> 00:44:19,839
It's a case of a brutal murder

829
00:44:20,095 --> 00:44:21,375
That was done because the victim was white

830
00:44:21,887 --> 00:44:26,239
If there's a piece of two white men chasing down a black man

831
00:44:26,495 --> 00:44:28,543
It's a situation where Alex would have done it himself

832
00:44:28,799 --> 00:44:30,591
Didn't do anything wrong

833
00:44:31,103 --> 00:44:31,871
This is

834
00:44:32,127 --> 00:44:34,175
How is racism is on Fulton

835
00:44:34,943 --> 00:44:35,967
He's too smart

836
00:44:36,223 --> 00:44:40,831
To make it to

837
00:44:41,087 --> 00:44:42,623
But was it a leaf

838
00:44:43,647 --> 00:44:44,159
The courts

839
00:44:44,927 --> 00:44:49,023
Right

840
00:44:49,535 --> 00:44:50,815
Suggest

841
00:44:51,071 --> 00:44:53,375
This is the second one should ever need

842
00:44:53,631 --> 00:44:54,143
Ever

843
00:44:54,399 --> 00:44:56,959
Ever this is such a simple

844
00:44:57,215 --> 00:45:00,287
F****** thing and it should the fact that it

845
00:45:00,799 --> 00:45:02,591
All out in the open

846
00:45:02,847 --> 00:45:06,687
Disqualified every single person who says anything other than

847
00:45:07,199 --> 00:45:08,991
Hey he was murdered by two bucks

848
00:45:09,503 --> 00:45:12,575
Modern lynchers is a race

849
00:45:13,343 --> 00:45:14,111
Vietnam

850
00:45:14,623 --> 00:45:15,903
Alex

851
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:21,791
Since the coronavirus situation has popped up

852
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:24,607
A number of times Alex has seen videos

853
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:26,143
He has decided

854
00:45:26,655 --> 00:45:31,775
It's real

855
00:45:32,799 --> 00:45:33,567
So Alex has been

856
00:45:33,823 --> 00:45:34,335
Trick by another

857
00:45:40,479 --> 00:45:40,991
Were you get the term

858
00:45:41,247 --> 00:45:42,527
Dojo

859
00:45:45,087 --> 00:45:46,111
Local news

860
00:45:48,159 --> 00:45:49,439
Children the women and

861
00:45:50,463 --> 00:45:50,975
Convulsing

862
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:52,767
So that's not true

863
00:45:53,279 --> 00:45:56,351
I want to see some videos that are making the rounds online

864
00:45:57,375 --> 00:46:00,959
The aftermath of a deadly covid-19 vaccination trial in New Guinea

865
00:46:01,471 --> 00:46:04,031
This was a video Simply put

866
00:46:04,799 --> 00:46:10,943
Someone took already existing video people in New Guinea protesting after some children had allegedly gotten sick from a vaccine and they

867
00:46:11,199 --> 00:46:13,247
Reclaim this

868
00:46:13,503 --> 00:46:19,647
Covid-19 vaccine 2019

869
00:46:19,903 --> 00:46:21,439
On a new station called

870
00:46:22,207 --> 00:46:27,839
The actual news report was about a community displeasure after a few children experience

871
00:46:28,095 --> 00:46:29,119
Dizziness and fever

872
00:46:29,375 --> 00:46:30,143
After being in a quote

873
00:46:30,399 --> 00:46:33,983
Drug treatment program to reduce the prevalence and intensity of

874
00:46:34,239 --> 00:46:35,263
The parasitic infection

875
00:46:37,311 --> 00:46:38,335
Crystal bios

876
00:46:39,615 --> 00:46:40,639
Also known as snail

877
00:46:41,663 --> 00:46:43,967
The editor-in-chief

878
00:46:46,015 --> 00:46:48,831
The editorial staff of begin an rvt group

879
00:46:49,087 --> 00:46:54,719
Notes with deep regret that some internet users have been allowing themselves since Monday April 6th 2020

880
00:46:54,975 --> 00:46:55,999
Do use one of our old

881
00:46:56,255 --> 00:46:57,535
Reports

882
00:46:57,791 --> 00:47:01,887
Recent cases of discomfort due to vaccination campaign

883
00:47:02,143 --> 00:47:03,679
In schools in do breakup

884
00:47:04,191 --> 00:47:05,983
We would like to point out that the report was

885
00:47:06,239 --> 00:47:07,007
Produced on March 8th

886
00:47:07,263 --> 00:47:08,287
18th 2019

887
00:47:08,799 --> 00:47:13,919
We invite you to refrain from such games during the sensitive. Marked by a global Health crisis

888
00:47:14,687 --> 00:47:19,039
This makes me think like I said of all the times Alex instead he just knows when he see the video if it's real or not

889
00:47:21,087 --> 00:47:23,135
Here's the reality

890
00:47:23,391 --> 00:47:26,463
The lazy propagandist meatballs for hoaxes like this regularly

891
00:47:26,719 --> 00:47:28,511
Which audiences fact

892
00:47:28,767 --> 00:47:29,535
Because he wants

893
00:47:30,303 --> 00:47:32,863
They conform to his Merit is enough they feel true to him

894
00:47:33,631 --> 00:47:34,143
Problem is

895
00:47:34,399 --> 00:47:34,911
None of it's real

896
00:47:35,423 --> 00:47:41,567
It's really frustrating that is is an airtight defense to say they're doing what we're doing well

897
00:47:42,847 --> 00:47:44,127
Really

898
00:47:44,383 --> 00:47:44,895
Because all the

899
00:47:45,919 --> 00:47:49,503
Videos and all of this s*** is all fake

900
00:47:49,759 --> 00:47:51,551
In the media's all liars and all that

901
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:54,111
And all he ever does well

902
00:47:59,743 --> 00:48:02,303
Perfectly comfortable assuming that Alex has no idea

903
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:08,191
Oh yeah I would be like I don't know

904
00:48:08,447 --> 00:48:10,751
Because I mean

905
00:48:12,543 --> 00:48:14,591
Like this

906
00:48:14,847 --> 00:48:15,871
Deceitful

907
00:48:21,503 --> 00:48:24,319
But he goes around like oh my God I can't believe New Guinea

908
00:48:24,575 --> 00:48:27,647
Yeah what matter what is frustrating is also that it doesn't matter if

909
00:48:27,903 --> 00:48:28,415
If it's true or not

910
00:48:28,927 --> 00:48:29,951
Well that's true

911
00:48:30,463 --> 00:48:31,999
Also didn't have nothing to do

912
00:48:32,511 --> 00:48:38,399
It is

913
00:48:38,911 --> 00:48:41,471
Guinea pigs are likely named for their association with Kenny

914
00:48:41,727 --> 00:48:44,543
Name for the area in Africa around the Gulf of Guinea

915
00:48:45,055 --> 00:48:49,407
And in the

916
00:48:49,663 --> 00:48:50,687
Exotic far-off places

917
00:48:50,943 --> 00:48:51,455
Is across the sea

918
00:48:51,967 --> 00:48:55,039
There's no real consensus among Scholars about exactly how

919
00:48:55,295 --> 00:48:57,855
Guinea pig got its name but one thing

920
00:48:58,623 --> 00:48:59,903
Is that has anything to do with New Guinea

921
00:49:00,671 --> 00:49:02,719
It's just another thing that Alex is making up

922
00:49:02,975 --> 00:49:04,255
To sound smart for his audience

923
00:49:04,511 --> 00:49:05,279
Based on nothing

924
00:49:05,791 --> 00:49:06,303
Immaculate

925
00:49:06,815 --> 00:49:08,863
You heard him report on a hoax video as a

926
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:11,935
Real makeup a piece of trivia about Guinea

927
00:49:12,959 --> 00:49:14,239
Which is standard operation

928
00:49:14,495 --> 00:49:16,287
For him memes

929
00:49:16,543 --> 00:49:17,823
Anything yeah that one

930
00:49:20,383 --> 00:49:22,687
Now I really got you just open with

931
00:49:23,199 --> 00:49:23,967
In New Guinea

932
00:49:24,223 --> 00:49:25,247
We're guinea pigs are from

933
00:49:25,759 --> 00:49:26,271
Soca

934
00:49:28,063 --> 00:49:32,671
Because he wants the association to be like you do tests on guinea pigs

935
00:49:33,183 --> 00:49:35,487
Of course the math is simple

936
00:49:35,743 --> 00:49:36,511
Right

937
00:49:38,303 --> 00:49:39,583
Everything about this

938
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:40,607
Very angry

939
00:49:41,887 --> 00:49:42,655
So Alex

940
00:49:43,167 --> 00:49:43,935
He knows

941
00:49:44,191 --> 00:49:44,703
Right

942
00:49:45,215 --> 00:49:49,823
You know that they're a bunch of studies that prove the vaccines lower your immunity right

943
00:49:50,847 --> 00:49:51,615
He knows that there are

944
00:49:52,127 --> 00:49:56,991
Okay but there are and now he's really confused because he sat down to try and find those study right

945
00:49:58,527 --> 00:50:02,111
They must be being taken offline conclusion

946
00:50:04,927 --> 00:50:06,463
You still you can type in

947
00:50:08,255 --> 00:50:09,535
Lower immunity

948
00:50:12,863 --> 00:50:13,375
I spent

949
00:50:14,143 --> 00:50:14,655
Today

950
00:50:20,543 --> 00:50:21,823
Find the article

951
00:50:23,103 --> 00:50:23,871
Remix

952
00:50:24,639 --> 00:50:26,431
Lowering

953
00:50:45,887 --> 00:50:48,703
Vaccines are perfect there's no side effects

954
00:50:52,031 --> 00:50:53,311
All this emotional crap

955
00:50:53,823 --> 00:50:55,871
You complaining about these doctors being fake

956
00:50:57,151 --> 00:50:58,687
Fake doctors

957
00:51:01,503 --> 00:51:07,647
I'm not saying they're actors

958
00:51:07,903 --> 00:51:12,767
On the level man

959
00:51:13,023 --> 00:51:16,351
A real guy is a real real friend

960
00:51:21,215 --> 00:51:25,055
You hang out with me

961
00:51:25,567 --> 00:51:31,711
Difficult

962
00:51:31,967 --> 00:51:38,111
He found them forever but his website

963
00:51:38,367 --> 00:51:41,439
Indication of yourself

964
00:51:41,951 --> 00:51:45,535
Because of that I really don't know what claims Alex is making

965
00:51:46,303 --> 00:51:49,887
Inserting Infowars website there's a number of articles about immunity issues and back

966
00:51:50,399 --> 00:51:54,239
Adjust things that Robert Kennedy Jr Road and Alex's repost

967
00:51:55,007 --> 00:52:00,127
These cases be claimed as weakened immune systems has to do with vaccinating children and exertion

968
00:52:04,479 --> 00:52:04,991
Unrelated

969
00:52:05,247 --> 00:52:06,015
Infection

970
00:52:06,527 --> 00:52:07,039
Doesn't sound

971
00:52:07,807 --> 00:52:11,391
Biomedicine

972
00:52:11,647 --> 00:52:14,719
Sandwich taken at face value claims the children

973
00:52:14,975 --> 00:52:18,559
Times Higher mortality if they had received

974
00:52:18,815 --> 00:52:19,583
Tetanus

975
00:52:19,839 --> 00:52:20,351
Pertussis facts

976
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:22,399
Compared to unvaccinated children

977
00:52:23,167 --> 00:52:25,471
These are children vaccinated between 1984

978
00:52:25,727 --> 00:52:26,239
1987

979
00:52:26,495 --> 00:52:28,287
This isn't even a steady but the currently used

980
00:52:28,543 --> 00:52:29,567
Dtp vaccine

981
00:52:32,639 --> 00:52:33,663
The pointed out which

982
00:52:33,919 --> 00:52:35,455
Conclusion not entirely reliable

983
00:52:36,479 --> 00:52:39,039
The first is that the study involves a very small sample

984
00:52:39,807 --> 00:52:41,599
They're only

985
00:52:41,855 --> 00:52:44,159
Current total in the study which is not enough to generalize

986
00:52:44,415 --> 00:52:45,951
Conclusions about vaccine effectiveness

987
00:52:46,207 --> 00:52:46,719
Or side effects

988
00:52:47,743 --> 00:52:49,535
However is that

989
00:52:49,791 --> 00:52:54,399
There's nothing in the study that actually shows that any of the children's deaths had anything to do with the vaccine

990
00:52:54,911 --> 00:52:56,703
These are all cause death numbers

991
00:52:56,959 --> 00:52:59,775
Which means that the death could have been from drowning or some other acts

992
00:53:00,287 --> 00:53:01,823
And it still be factored into the rate

993
00:53:02,335 --> 00:53:05,407
And this makes the conclusions are very difficult to apply generally

994
00:53:06,175 --> 00:53:08,223
Studies have not come to the same thing

995
00:53:08,479 --> 00:53:11,295
Conclusion and the argument the vaccines lower your

996
00:53:11,551 --> 00:53:15,647
Other than what the vaccine is targeting is rejected by science

997
00:53:16,671 --> 00:53:18,207
2018 record in Jama

998
00:53:19,487 --> 00:53:23,839
District Lea significant differences in the level of immunity against a non-vaccine targeted infection

999
00:53:24,351 --> 00:53:26,399
Between our control and experimental group

1000
00:53:27,167 --> 00:53:29,727
That might be what I want to talk about but I'm only guessing

1001
00:53:29,983 --> 00:53:31,263
Based on what's on his website

1002
00:53:31,519 --> 00:53:35,871
There's another argument about vaccines lowering immunity

1003
00:53:36,127 --> 00:53:36,639
From Andrew wakes

1004
00:53:37,663 --> 00:53:41,503
This one is basically they would use vaccines immune response

1005
00:53:42,527 --> 00:53:43,551
And while the other part is

1006
00:53:43,807 --> 00:53:45,343
Is not used in buses weekend

1007
00:53:46,111 --> 00:53:49,695
Basic gist here is that he saying that you get better immunity by dealing with

1008
00:53:49,951 --> 00:53:50,463
Naturally

1009
00:53:50,975 --> 00:53:53,279
So you should get measles if you want to be immune to it

1010
00:53:53,535 --> 00:53:57,119
If you takes a shortcut of vaccines and mediated response

1011
00:53:57,375 --> 00:53:58,399
Related immunity

1012
00:53:58,911 --> 00:54:00,703
This is nonsense to know in the medical field takes

1013
00:54:00,959 --> 00:54:02,751
Seriously yeah that sounds like

1014
00:54:03,007 --> 00:54:03,519
Like magic

1015
00:54:04,031 --> 00:54:07,871
Sincerely I'm sure a precise claim Alex is trying to make butter

1016
00:54:08,127 --> 00:54:14,271
It's not too hard to separate similar

1017
00:54:15,039 --> 00:54:16,319
What time is very easily

1018
00:54:16,575 --> 00:54:17,087
Rock ideas

1019
00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:20,927
Vaccines do not lower your

1020
00:54:21,695 --> 00:54:24,511
Finding studies cuz they probably weren't there to begin with

1021
00:54:25,023 --> 00:54:31,167
I imagine you just read some headlines 10 years ago embellished it into being a prestigious study

1022
00:54:31,423 --> 00:54:33,727
The most reputable Journey Journal known to man

1023
00:54:34,239 --> 00:54:36,799
And now he goes and tries to find it shockingly nothing comes up

1024
00:54:37,055 --> 00:54:41,407
That seems to be what's going on

1025
00:54:41,919 --> 00:54:47,039
I have the okay okay fine you know what I'm actually going to prove it this screaming about

1026
00:54:47,551 --> 00:54:51,647
Lower your immunity for forever so f*** you I'm going to look it up and I'll find it

1027
00:54:52,159 --> 00:54:53,183
And I can't

1028
00:54:53,439 --> 00:54:59,583
I can't find it because they got rid of it

1029
00:55:02,399 --> 00:55:03,167
You know how the internet

1030
00:55:03,679 --> 00:55:05,471
Famously allows people to hide

1031
00:55:07,263 --> 00:55:09,567
So

1032
00:55:10,591 --> 00:55:14,175
They're trying to get rid of this consumers to not have

1033
00:55:14,431 --> 00:55:18,271
The information they need Alex has an amazing comparison

1034
00:55:18,527 --> 00:55:19,039
Symptoms

1035
00:55:21,599 --> 00:55:23,647
They're just not letting

1036
00:55:24,415 --> 00:55:26,207
Bianchi at Lewis's the jungle

1037
00:55:26,719 --> 00:55:28,255
The level of abuse of the citizens

1038
00:55:30,815 --> 00:55:31,327
Consumers

1039
00:55:31,583 --> 00:55:32,607
I want to be sure everyone

1040
00:55:32,863 --> 00:55:33,375
Want to hear that

1041
00:55:33,631 --> 00:55:35,167
There's no other name TS Lewis

1042
00:55:35,679 --> 00:55:41,311
Probably a fun combination of TS Eliot c.s. Lewis

1043
00:55:48,735 --> 00:55:50,527
It's always fun to pretend to be into someone

1044
00:55:50,783 --> 00:55:54,879
But but also believe that everything that motivate their life's work is death

1045
00:55:55,135 --> 00:55:56,671
And plus the jungle was

1046
00:55:56,927 --> 00:56:03,071
Even a blind squirrel finds

1047
00:56:03,327 --> 00:56:03,839
No.

1048
00:56:05,119 --> 00:56:05,631
Weird

1049
00:56:06,143 --> 00:56:07,167
Alex

1050
00:56:07,935 --> 00:56:08,959
What does my

1051
00:56:09,215 --> 00:56:09,983
One of the reasons

1052
00:56:11,007 --> 00:56:17,151
Yummy I hadn't heard this episode when we put out episode on Monday

1053
00:56:18,687 --> 00:56:19,455
Would you listen to this

1054
00:56:19,711 --> 00:56:20,735
Kind of understand

1055
00:56:20,991 --> 00:56:24,575
Why I feel like that sort of stuff does fit into the body

1056
00:56:24,831 --> 00:56:25,343
Of our work

1057
00:56:25,855 --> 00:56:27,135
The Bourne Supremacy

1058
00:56:27,647 --> 00:56:29,439
Movies the origin when I forget the name of it

1059
00:56:35,839 --> 00:56:36,351
Publix

1060
00:56:38,911 --> 00:56:39,679
Only eats

1061
00:56:39,935 --> 00:56:40,447
Certain

1062
00:56:40,959 --> 00:56:41,727
Brain

1063
00:56:51,967 --> 00:56:52,735
2000-lb but

1064
00:56:52,991 --> 00:56:54,015
You know you're a white lie.

1065
00:57:02,719 --> 00:57:08,863
Imagine

1066
00:57:11,935 --> 00:57:15,007
He's talking about the childish nonsense

1067
00:57:15,775 --> 00:57:18,335
There's a phenomenon known as hysterical strength

1068
00:57:18,591 --> 00:57:21,407
CB2

1069
00:57:21,663 --> 00:57:22,431
Car to get someone

1070
00:57:22,687 --> 00:57:24,223
You're saying someone is trapped underneath

1071
00:57:24,991 --> 00:57:28,319
It's the idea that in moments of severe need we find ourselves capable

1072
00:57:30,879 --> 00:57:32,927
Naturally this is something that's almost impossible to

1073
00:57:33,183 --> 00:57:34,463
Study in a controlled setting

1074
00:57:34,719 --> 00:57:40,607
How Could You reliably create the conditions that we needed to produce this response in a person while controlling for other variables

1075
00:57:41,119 --> 00:57:42,143
Basically you can't

1076
00:57:42,399 --> 00:57:46,239
Researchers who work with muscles kind of understand the basic idea without needing

1077
00:57:46,495 --> 00:57:47,263
To trap a subject

1078
00:57:47,519 --> 00:57:50,079
A test subject a loved one under a car

1079
00:57:50,335 --> 00:57:53,407
Okay what you do because you can't let them in bed

1080
00:57:53,663 --> 00:57:59,807
Experiment otherwise they'll know that they're sure I don't know if science

1081
00:58:00,063 --> 00:58:03,647
Ashton Kutcher and then we go from there

1082
00:58:03,903 --> 00:58:04,415
I think that's

1083
00:58:04,671 --> 00:58:06,719
One of brilliance

1084
00:58:07,231 --> 00:58:08,255
Sure and to

1085
00:58:08,767 --> 00:58:09,535
A great way to run

1086
00:58:10,047 --> 00:58:11,839
Muscles understand

1087
00:58:12,607 --> 00:58:13,375
Like for instance

1088
00:58:13,631 --> 00:58:15,167
Do you use exactly as much

1089
00:58:15,423 --> 00:58:16,959
Muscle as you need to open

1090
00:58:17,215 --> 00:58:17,727
Your fridge

1091
00:58:21,823 --> 00:58:26,943
If you're tearing up like a bunch of groceries applied to allocate more

1092
00:58:27,199 --> 00:58:28,991
To use

1093
00:58:29,759 --> 00:58:31,039
German article on the BBC

1094
00:58:32,063 --> 00:58:36,159
Estimate the amount of muscle mass recruited during

1095
00:58:36,415 --> 00:58:38,207
Maximal exercise around sixty percent

1096
00:58:39,487 --> 00:58:43,071
Even Ali deathly to train to get more output from their musculature

1097
00:58:43,327 --> 00:58:46,143
Why don't we harness around 80 per-cent of their theoretical strength

1098
00:58:46,655 --> 00:58:48,191
Why do we keep so much in reserve

1099
00:58:48,703 --> 00:58:49,215
Safety

1100
00:58:49,471 --> 00:58:49,983
Essentially

1101
00:58:50,495 --> 00:58:56,639
If we were to exert our muscles to or beyond their absolute maximum we could tear muscle tissue ligaments tendons break

1102
00:58:56,895 --> 00:58:57,919
Nothing Dire Straits

1103
00:58:58,943 --> 00:59:05,087
That Governor your brain is there because if you were allowed to expand all the available energy

1104
00:59:05,343 --> 00:59:06,367
You died long ago

1105
00:59:06,623 --> 00:59:07,647
Doobie

1106
00:59:07,903 --> 00:59:11,487
Completely debilitated due to all of the bodily damage you would have supper

1107
00:59:13,023 --> 00:59:14,559
Only lifting a small part of the

1108
00:59:14,815 --> 00:59:17,887
The car with two or three wheels remain on the ground Distributing

1109
00:59:18,399 --> 00:59:22,495
Plus their bodies are full of adrenaline shoc

1110
00:59:22,751 --> 00:59:24,543
They might be feeling from the heavier whip

1111
00:59:24,799 --> 00:59:26,335
It even so

1112
00:59:26,591 --> 00:59:28,127
Pretty f****** sore afterwards

1113
00:59:29,151 --> 00:59:30,943
These parts of your brain could be overridden

1114
00:59:32,991 --> 00:59:35,295
Viking cases when you're trying to escape certain death

1115
00:59:35,807 --> 00:59:39,647
Your brain realizes that in order to stay alive higher risks need to be taken

1116
00:59:40,159 --> 00:59:44,511
On the other side of that coin is part of the brain also appears to be overridden when you're on meth

1117
00:59:44,767 --> 00:59:45,279
PCP

1118
00:59:45,535 --> 00:59:46,303
Which may play a role in

1119
00:59:46,559 --> 00:59:48,095
Explaining the seemingly height and strength

1120
00:59:48,351 --> 00:59:49,375
Two people on those drugs

1121
00:59:50,143 --> 00:59:51,679
You need to these cases however

1122
00:59:54,751 --> 00:59:56,799
Free of this Governor your brain

1123
00:59:57,055 --> 00:59:58,591
The party braids are for a reason

1124
00:59:58,847 --> 01:00:02,175
Yeah usually helps out whenever you survive

1125
01:00:02,687 --> 01:00:03,199
Long a

1126
01:00:04,991 --> 01:00:08,319
You do like he's crazy Feats of Strength

1127
01:00:08,575 --> 01:00:13,183
When you come back to be in so much pain

1128
01:00:13,439 --> 01:00:14,207
Then how dare you

1129
01:00:14,463 --> 01:00:20,607
Is this some kind of a magical thing that allows super soldiers like Jason Bourne to use more of his strength than normal people's brains

1130
01:00:20,863 --> 01:00:24,191
Maybe operate on the level of an elite athlete

1131
01:00:24,703 --> 01:00:29,823
Is a person like a human person were to do what Alex is imagining their bodies would not be able to handle it

1132
01:00:30,079 --> 01:00:33,151
They're just physiological realities that he's pretending exist

1133
01:00:33,663 --> 01:00:34,943
The whale

1134
01:00:35,199 --> 01:00:36,223
If your life is at risk

1135
01:00:36,479 --> 01:00:40,319
You could jump down a big drop breaker ankle that run a mile to safety

1136
01:00:40,575 --> 01:00:41,599
When you get the safety

1137
01:00:41,855 --> 01:00:43,391
Your ankle is still going to be broken

1138
01:00:43,647 --> 01:00:44,671
And it's going to hurt like hell

1139
01:00:44,927 --> 01:00:45,695
Just ran a mile on

1140
01:00:46,207 --> 01:00:52,095
What the f*** do I know I've watched or is Alex

1141
01:00:52,607 --> 01:00:53,887
Stop f****** dumb dumb

1142
01:00:54,143 --> 01:00:55,679
Remember I don't think

1143
01:00:56,191 --> 01:00:56,703
The Bourne movies

1144
01:00:56,959 --> 01:01:00,031
Featured super soldier strength

1145
01:01:00,287 --> 01:01:00,799
He's just

1146
01:01:01,055 --> 01:01:02,335
Really really well-trained

1147
01:01:02,847 --> 01:01:03,871
Imma give him some psychotropic

1148
01:01:04,127 --> 01:01:08,735
Is really really good at being a spire

1149
01:01:08,991 --> 01:01:12,575
Yeah that was just like look at what happens when you're really

1150
01:01:18,463 --> 01:01:21,279
Whatever Alex got something out of it so that's great

1151
01:01:21,535 --> 01:01:22,303
You can't

1152
01:01:22,815 --> 01:01:25,119
Trent like you can't have your brain

1153
01:01:25,631 --> 01:01:27,423
Drop that Governor without comp

1154
01:01:27,679 --> 01:01:28,703
First of all

1155
01:01:29,215 --> 01:01:31,775
Second of all there is a season

1156
01:01:35,103 --> 01:01:35,871
Thinking it's it's the

1157
01:01:36,127 --> 01:01:36,639
It's ludicrous

1158
01:01:37,663 --> 01:01:41,503
Alex ideas is this predictive

1159
01:01:42,271 --> 01:01:46,623
ShopRite the globalist to put stuff on TV they're going to do later

1160
01:01:46,879 --> 01:01:47,647
Exactly like been a

1161
01:01:48,415 --> 01:01:49,439
Sometimes

1162
01:01:49,695 --> 01:01:51,231
It has to do with

1163
01:01:51,487 --> 01:01:53,023
They need to get your permission

1164
01:01:53,279 --> 01:01:54,559
Of course there is

1165
01:01:54,815 --> 01:02:00,959
Have to pay in the afterlife or something

1166
01:02:01,215 --> 01:02:04,799
You can only get sick if you allow the virus

1167
01:02:05,055 --> 01:02:06,847
Sometimes there's a metaphysical last

1168
01:02:07,103 --> 01:02:10,431
Back to it and then sometimes it's presented as

1169
01:02:10,687 --> 01:02:13,503
Trying to desensitize you to what they're going to

1170
01:02:13,759 --> 01:02:14,783
Do to make it easier

1171
01:02:15,295 --> 01:02:16,063
Is next clip

1172
01:02:16,319 --> 01:02:18,367
Begins with Alex talking about

1173
01:02:18,623 --> 01:02:19,647
Predictive programming

1174
01:02:21,183 --> 01:02:22,207
The desensitizing level

1175
01:02:22,975 --> 01:02:25,535
Find and start screaming

1176
01:02:25,791 --> 01:02:26,303
Grandpa

1177
01:02:26,815 --> 01:02:28,863
Psychologist psychiatrist at the high levels

1178
01:02:29,887 --> 01:02:30,399
Psychologist

1179
01:02:33,471 --> 01:02:34,495
Home

1180
01:02:40,127 --> 01:02:40,639
And pizza

1181
01:02:44,991 --> 01:02:46,527
Marriott

1182
01:02:53,695 --> 01:02:55,487
It wasn't because he couldn't handle violence

1183
01:03:11,103 --> 01:03:13,151
With the real thing you don't know what hit you

1184
01:03:13,407 --> 01:03:19,551
So first of all I don't need to see Alex's citation on this stuff from the high-end psychologist to Arnot pop psychologist

1185
01:03:20,063 --> 01:03:24,927
Information when he tells me what he's actually talking about and where it's coming from

1186
01:03:26,207 --> 01:03:27,231
That clip is fascinating

1187
01:03:27,487 --> 01:03:30,559
Because I really think it highlights how poorly Alex's brain tracks ideas

1188
01:03:31,327 --> 01:03:35,679
It begins I'm claiming three of these high-end on pop psychologist to know

1189
01:03:35,935 --> 01:03:42,079
They know that if you see something on TV

1190
01:03:42,335 --> 01:03:43,615
Pizza good

1191
01:03:44,127 --> 01:03:47,455
I can definitely tell you that it is not true from buying personal experience

1192
01:03:47,711 --> 01:03:48,479
In the last few weeks

1193
01:03:49,247 --> 01:03:50,783
Cars app

1194
01:03:51,039 --> 01:03:55,135
F***** on in movies and TV shows sometimes

1195
01:03:55,647 --> 01:03:56,671
It doesn't affect me that much

1196
01:03:57,183 --> 01:03:57,695
In the movie

1197
01:03:58,207 --> 01:03:59,743
When I was walking to the store the other day

1198
01:04:00,511 --> 01:04:03,327
A driver turning right didn't see me when I had to walk signal

1199
01:04:03,583 --> 01:04:05,887
I was legit seconds away from getting run over

1200
01:04:06,399 --> 01:04:12,287
I heard the car accelerating and the split-second as my brain was putting it all together in a

1201
01:04:12,543 --> 01:04:14,591
Associated with being at home eating pizza

1202
01:04:15,103 --> 01:04:16,127
My reaction was quite

1203
01:04:19,199 --> 01:04:19,711
Send pictures

1204
01:04:19,967 --> 01:04:21,503
Because it wasn't real life

1205
01:04:21,759 --> 01:04:22,783
And my adrenaline rush

1206
01:04:23,295 --> 01:04:26,367
Others considering Jumping On The Who tour trying to die backward

1207
01:04:27,135 --> 01:04:29,695
Thankfully the driver saw me at the last second hit the brakes

1208
01:04:31,487 --> 01:04:35,583
Next block my body was full of that Rush

1209
01:04:36,351 --> 01:04:40,191
Both of those things on TV and movies

1210
01:04:40,447 --> 01:04:43,007
Primarily because I know the difference between real life and movies

1211
01:04:44,031 --> 01:04:45,567
From this idea Alex

1212
01:04:45,823 --> 01:04:47,103
Talking about his grandfather

1213
01:04:47,359 --> 01:04:51,711
What is because he

1214
01:04:52,223 --> 01:04:54,527
An argument could be made that this is the exact opposite

1215
01:04:54,783 --> 01:04:55,295
The point Alex

1216
01:04:56,575 --> 01:04:57,343
He's saying

1217
01:04:58,367 --> 01:05:00,671
Exxon TV desensitize a 2X in real life

1218
01:05:00,927 --> 01:05:04,767
Where is it this example

1219
01:05:05,023 --> 01:05:05,791
Representative

1220
01:05:06,303 --> 01:05:08,351
At 8 or his kids seeing it on TV

1221
01:05:08,863 --> 01:05:14,239
Whether or not this hypersensitivity was driven by a fear that the children would become desensitized to violence

1222
01:05:15,263 --> 01:05:17,823
The case example

1223
01:05:18,079 --> 01:05:20,639
Because it's disconnected from the point you're trying to make

1224
01:05:21,663 --> 01:05:27,039
From there Alex make the jump to our simulated violence on TV you think it's funny

1225
01:05:27,295 --> 01:05:29,087
So you think of murders funny in real life

1226
01:05:29,855 --> 01:05:34,975
Weirdly claims that this is because you didn't see any consequences for the fictional violence who's on TV

1227
01:05:35,231 --> 01:05:36,767
Which is weird that's bizarre

1228
01:05:37,535 --> 01:05:38,815
I don't know who he's hanging out with

1229
01:05:39,071 --> 01:05:40,863
Get the idea that a large number of people think

1230
01:05:41,119 --> 01:05:42,399
Real murder is funny

1231
01:05:42,655 --> 01:05:48,799
That's a foreign concept to me

1232
01:05:50,079 --> 01:05:51,615
I don't think it's real

1233
01:05:51,871 --> 01:05:52,383
Least

1234
01:05:52,639 --> 01:05:54,175
Say I'm walking

1235
01:05:54,943 --> 01:05:55,455
I didn't

1236
01:05:55,711 --> 01:05:57,503
You didn't pass huge wasted

1237
01:05:58,527 --> 01:06:02,367
Most people intuitively understand the difference between reality and fictional portrayals of

1238
01:06:02,879 --> 01:06:05,439
Unexpectedly they react differently to them

1239
01:06:05,951 --> 01:06:11,583
The same person who could tolerate seeing the depiction of a murder in a horror movie

1240
01:06:11,839 --> 01:06:15,423
Would react completely different they saw something similar in the real world

1241
01:06:15,679 --> 01:06:16,959
Good enough people

1242
01:06:17,215 --> 01:06:18,751
Do you remember Meet Joe Black

1243
01:06:19,263 --> 01:06:21,823
Whenever

1244
01:06:22,079 --> 01:06:24,383
12 different cars all at the same time

1245
01:06:24,639 --> 01:06:26,687
It played for Laughs like there

1246
01:06:28,223 --> 01:06:31,295
It's the weirdest thing I've ever seen

1247
01:06:31,551 --> 01:06:34,367
Leatherface

1248
01:06:34,623 --> 01:06:38,463
Like longingly look back at each other each expecting the other one to look back

1249
01:06:38,719 --> 01:06:39,231
And it goes bad

1250
01:06:39,487 --> 01:06:41,279
Back and forth like 4 different times

1251
01:06:41,535 --> 01:06:44,095
And then Brad Pitt just walks into oncoming traffic

1252
01:06:44,351 --> 01:06:44,863
Can gets hit

1253
01:06:45,119 --> 01:06:51,263
Once bounces up in the air

1254
01:06:52,031 --> 01:06:58,175
I meant the singing is basically over and they just move on I have not seen that movie in a long time

1255
01:06:58,431 --> 01:07:00,735
Did not affect the way I responded.

1256
01:07:06,623 --> 01:07:11,231
Spiritual embodiment of death took over your body for a while and Paramore

1257
01:07:11,743 --> 01:07:13,023
That's so ridiculous

1258
01:07:13,535 --> 01:07:15,327
Some studies that suggest

1259
01:07:15,583 --> 01:07:19,679
Children and Adolescent

1260
01:07:19,935 --> 01:07:23,007
Almost impossible

1261
01:07:23,775 --> 01:07:27,103
Computer for a second even go about trying to set up that study at

1262
01:07:27,615 --> 01:07:28,895
Like to really track that

1263
01:07:29,151 --> 01:07:29,919
Ashton Kutcher

1264
01:07:31,455 --> 01:07:37,343
There's some correlations the people of sound

1265
01:07:37,855 --> 01:07:40,927
He's acting like if you see a bomb go off in a movie

1266
01:07:41,183 --> 01:07:43,743
And you can counter a bomb in your daily life you like that

1267
01:07:43,999 --> 01:07:47,071
Like that booty cool

1268
01:07:47,327 --> 01:07:51,679
For that make people laugh and I survived because it was

1269
01:07:51,935 --> 01:07:52,447
Yeah

1270
01:07:52,703 --> 01:07:53,983
No this is just a video game

1271
01:07:54,239 --> 01:07:56,799
Desensitize children

1272
01:07:57,311 --> 01:08:03,455
It's not just that operates differently than most people

1273
01:08:03,711 --> 01:08:04,223
Recognized

1274
01:08:04,479 --> 01:08:05,503
The distinction between

1275
01:08:06,015 --> 01:08:06,783
Fiction and reality

1276
01:08:07,295 --> 01:08:08,575
It seems to be

1277
01:08:09,087 --> 01:08:11,135
Like it seems to be something he is unwilling

1278
01:08:11,391 --> 01:08:13,183
Or unable to differentiate between

1279
01:08:14,719 --> 01:08:18,559
Doesn't realize if it is something that most

1280
01:08:18,815 --> 01:08:22,143
People can differentiate some confusion around why other people

1281
01:08:22,399 --> 01:08:23,679
Can't see what he sees does

1282
01:08:23,935 --> 01:08:24,447
Steam Jenny

1283
01:08:24,959 --> 01:08:27,007
That frustration he's emanifest

1284
01:08:27,263 --> 01:08:28,543
Don't seem like someone who's like

1285
01:08:29,055 --> 01:08:31,615
It's so clear to me why.

1286
01:08:32,383 --> 01:08:34,175
That is that is wild

1287
01:08:36,991 --> 01:08:42,879
Don't you get it the Hammers can fly now Dan you just call him to you and the hammer will come to

1288
01:08:43,391 --> 01:08:47,487
Ugly to you whenever you need it I'm honestly starting to work on a little bit of

1289
01:08:47,743 --> 01:08:50,047
Siri this is one of the more like

1290
01:08:50,303 --> 01:08:51,839
Strongly correlated

1291
01:08:52,095 --> 01:08:53,119
Things throughout

1292
01:08:53,375 --> 01:08:54,911
These conspiracy world

1293
01:08:55,423 --> 01:08:56,959
The inability or unwillingness

1294
01:08:57,215 --> 01:08:59,519
Differentiate between reality and fiction

1295
01:08:59,775 --> 01:09:02,591
Run so strongly on Infowars

1296
01:09:02,847 --> 01:09:05,151
Many of the associated people

1297
01:09:05,407 --> 01:09:09,759
Anti project experts

1298
01:09:10,015 --> 01:09:10,527
It's

1299
01:09:10,783 --> 01:09:12,319
It seems to be

1300
01:09:12,575 --> 01:09:14,111
One of the defining character

1301
01:09:15,391 --> 01:09:19,231
Valentine's Day rant

1302
01:09:19,487 --> 01:09:19,999
And of course

1303
01:09:20,767 --> 01:09:21,279
Familiar territory

1304
01:09:23,839 --> 01:09:24,351
Is your brain

1305
01:09:24,607 --> 01:09:25,631
Didn't pay any consequence

1306
01:09:27,167 --> 01:09:29,727
The real thing you don't know what hit

1307
01:09:31,263 --> 01:09:33,567
You're all dead unless you wake up and decide

1308
01:09:34,847 --> 01:09:35,359
The created

1309
01:09:39,967 --> 01:09:44,063
I need money to just go straight to an end

1310
01:09:48,927 --> 01:09:51,231
Attempt Sunday show in the books

1311
01:09:51,487 --> 01:09:53,279
The goddamn place

1312
01:09:53,535 --> 01:09:59,679
I kind of appreciate on someone

1313
01:09:59,935 --> 01:10:01,215
You got a loan Alex

1314
01:10:02,495 --> 01:10:05,055
Viking funerals pretty fun

1315
01:10:05,311 --> 01:10:06,335
Alex is weird

1316
01:10:07,359 --> 01:10:13,247
Fiction reality

1317
01:10:13,503 --> 01:10:15,295
To learn a little bit about

1318
01:10:18,111 --> 01:10:19,135
Antboy this day

1319
01:10:21,183 --> 01:10:23,999
Say what Alex has a goal

1320
01:10:24,255 --> 01:10:27,071
Well you're not having to look at it right now

1321
01:10:27,583 --> 01:10:29,887
The Bill Gates uniform

1322
01:10:30,655 --> 01:10:32,447
Mark Zuckerberg

1323
01:10:36,799 --> 01:10:37,567
With a

1324
01:10:38,079 --> 01:10:38,591
White

1325
01:10:39,103 --> 01:10:39,615
Shirt

1326
01:10:40,383 --> 01:10:41,151
To look like Mister Rogers

1327
01:10:42,687 --> 01:10:43,711
Nonce

1328
01:10:44,735 --> 01:10:48,575
Hitler war war

1329
01:10:49,087 --> 01:10:49,855
Because he would have loved

1330
01:10:50,111 --> 01:10:50,623
Non-threatening

1331
01:10:51,135 --> 01:10:53,183
This is really funny on a number of levels

1332
01:10:53,695 --> 01:10:58,815
The first is that Alex decided this Bill Gates wears pink B was

1333
01:11:01,887 --> 01:11:06,751
You kind of can't help but think he's hoping people online make fun of him so you can be all over Twitter again

1334
01:11:07,263 --> 01:11:11,615
The second part that's hilarious here is a Hitler War Pinkie be non-threatening

1335
01:11:12,127 --> 01:11:18,271
Alex claims to be a military historian but somehow he doesn't realize that the US army officers winter service

1336
01:11:18,527 --> 01:11:21,855
I'm starting in the 19th was known as the

1337
01:11:22,367 --> 01:11:23,647
Pink and greens

1338
01:11:24,159 --> 01:11:29,023
US Army officer uniform during that very time that they were literally had p

1339
01:11:29,279 --> 01:11:31,839
Pink in the neighborhood

1340
01:11:32,095 --> 01:11:37,727
Military.com

1341
01:11:41,055 --> 01:11:41,823
Complete buffoon

1342
01:11:44,639 --> 01:11:45,151
He's just

1343
01:11:45,919 --> 01:11:49,759
I love it I love the idea that his operation so f****** kapital

1344
01:11:52,831 --> 01:11:54,111
Everyone's going to love it love

1345
01:11:55,647 --> 01:11:57,439
Blow Minds

1346
01:11:57,951 --> 01:11:58,719
Look at me

1347
01:11:58,975 --> 01:12:00,511
Alex Jones work

1348
01:12:00,767 --> 01:12:01,791
Everyone

1349
01:12:03,071 --> 01:12:05,119
And so I thought maybe it's just like all right

1350
01:12:05,375 --> 01:12:06,911
ChaCha

1351
01:12:07,167 --> 01:12:07,935
Get out of business

1352
01:12:08,703 --> 01:12:09,727
I've always said

1353
01:12:10,751 --> 01:12:11,263
Hitler

1354
01:12:12,287 --> 01:12:16,127
Or a pink uniform he would have won World War because people would have

1355
01:12:16,639 --> 01:12:17,151
Said

1356
01:12:17,407 --> 01:12:18,687
Somebody

1357
01:12:19,455 --> 01:12:20,223
Nothing but good

1358
01:12:22,271 --> 01:12:24,831
Bella Melinda Gates always wear pink in public it's why

1359
01:12:27,391 --> 01:12:28,671
Characteristic

1360
01:12:28,927 --> 01:12:29,439
T-shirt

1361
01:12:29,695 --> 01:12:30,975
Female wears pink

1362
01:12:31,231 --> 01:12:31,999
Sweaters

1363
01:12:32,511 --> 01:12:34,303
Under his mentor Bill Gates

1364
01:12:34,815 --> 01:12:39,423
I was curious about the claim that Bill Gates always where is Pink's image search

1365
01:12:39,935 --> 01:12:44,543
51st 100 images

1366
01:12:45,055 --> 01:12:46,335
In 56 of the images

1367
01:12:46,591 --> 01:12:47,359
Is Gators in a suit

1368
01:12:57,599 --> 01:12:58,367
Might as well

1369
01:12:58,623 --> 01:12:59,903
Exactly two pictures

1370
01:13:00,159 --> 01:13:05,023
Navigate to the pink sweater from his 2015 TED Talk

1371
01:13:07,327 --> 01:13:08,607
At least one of these is from a site that

1372
01:13:16,799 --> 01:13:18,591
From Gates's five-year-old TED Talk

1373
01:13:21,407 --> 01:13:22,943
Constantly wearing

1374
01:13:23,199 --> 01:13:23,711
Weather

1375
01:13:24,223 --> 01:13:28,575
As for Zuckerberg I have no idea where Alex saw him wearing a sweater but I also don't care

1376
01:13:28,831 --> 01:13:32,671
This is just a super weird hang-up Alex has Batman wearing colors he thinks

1377
01:13:33,183 --> 01:13:34,719
We better pray that he never finds out

1378
01:13:34,975 --> 01:13:36,767
The Trump wear a pink striped

1379
01:13:37,023 --> 01:13:39,071
Virus press conference

1380
01:13:39,327 --> 01:13:41,375
Or the Trump sells a bunch of different

1381
01:13:44,191 --> 01:13:45,727
Their manly pink too bright

1382
01:13:48,799 --> 01:13:50,591
Which is the difference

1383
01:13:50,847 --> 01:13:51,871
I understand

1384
01:13:52,639 --> 01:13:56,479
I'm just glad that he's gotten this out of his system and we can move on to other is

1385
01:13:56,735 --> 01:13:59,551
Warren Buffett

1386
01:14:00,575 --> 01:14:01,599
Almost

1387
01:14:02,367 --> 01:14:02,879
With a nice

1388
01:14:04,159 --> 01:14:04,671
Look

1389
01:14:05,183 --> 01:14:05,951
Scream town

1390
01:14:08,511 --> 01:14:09,535
Like a little boy

1391
01:14:10,303 --> 01:14:12,607
He's like a little child he doesn't longer

1392
01:14:13,375 --> 01:14:14,399
The drug money

1393
01:14:14,911 --> 01:14:15,423
Are doing it

1394
01:14:16,191 --> 01:14:16,959
2000

1395
01:14:18,239 --> 01:14:20,543
So this Obsession has got to stop

1396
01:14:22,847 --> 01:14:24,895
We retook

1397
01:14:25,151 --> 01:14:31,295
Compelling content is just naming off his enemies of discussing the nefarious implications of what they're wearing

1398
01:14:31,807 --> 01:14:33,087
Past its expiration date

1399
01:14:33,343 --> 01:14:34,623
This is not hard hitting stuff

1400
01:14:35,135 --> 01:14:40,511
Yeah I tried to find pictures of Ron Paul

1401
01:14:42,303 --> 01:14:46,911
I will do that I couldn't find any pictures of your bolsonaro in pink but that totally makes sense since he's a

1402
01:14:47,167 --> 01:14:47,679
Invested in

1403
01:14:47,935 --> 01:14:49,983
Performative masculinity is Alex's so

1404
01:14:51,519 --> 01:14:55,871
It shouldn't surprise anyone to hear

1405
01:14:56,127 --> 01:14:56,639
Batman suit

1406
01:14:56,895 --> 01:14:58,687
It's kind of Hispanic

1407
01:14:59,199 --> 01:15:00,735
I can't find any pictures

1408
01:15:00,991 --> 01:15:05,087
Peak outside of the possibility some pink dress shirt in a suit or possibly pink tie

1409
01:15:05,343 --> 01:15:09,951
Hopefully he doesn't get photographed all the time with ice cream definitely has a few times

1410
01:15:10,207 --> 01:15:11,743
And the reason isn't

1411
01:15:11,999 --> 01:15:13,023
Innocent child

1412
01:15:13,279 --> 01:15:16,351
It's because Berkshire Hathaway the holding company that he owned

1413
01:15:16,607 --> 01:15:17,631
Old Dairy Queen

1414
01:15:17,887 --> 01:15:19,423
I was going to say

1415
01:15:19,679 --> 01:15:20,447
It's so awesome

1416
01:15:20,959 --> 01:15:21,727
So f***

1417
01:15:22,751 --> 01:15:23,519
It's the most

1418
01:15:23,775 --> 01:15:26,079
Ridiculously obvious thing that you can say

1419
01:15:26,591 --> 01:15:27,871
But the only reason they bought

1420
01:15:28,127 --> 01:15:29,663
Dairy Queen is so later on in life

1421
01:15:29,919 --> 01:15:30,943
He could f******

1422
01:15:33,247 --> 01:15:37,343
Broadcast

1423
01:15:37,599 --> 01:15:39,903
Also worried about the money laundering

1424
01:15:40,159 --> 01:15:40,927
In 2010

1425
01:15:41,183 --> 01:15:43,743
But there is this represent

1426
01:15:44,767 --> 01:15:46,559
In 2010 the DEA conducted

1427
01:15:46,815 --> 01:15:48,607
And concluded a 22-month investor

1428
01:15:48,863 --> 01:15:49,887
Navigation that it uncovered

1429
01:15:50,143 --> 01:15:52,191
The dollars that cartels

1430
01:15:52,447 --> 01:15:53,471
Through Wachovia Bank

1431
01:15:53,727 --> 01:15:57,311
By that point I had been bought by Wells Fargo

1432
01:15:57,567 --> 01:16:00,383
Of which Berkshire Hathaway is the fifth largest shareholder

1433
01:16:00,895 --> 01:16:01,663
Wells Fargo

1434
01:16:01,919 --> 01:16:03,455
The choir Wachovia until 2000

1435
01:16:03,711 --> 01:16:07,295
She's definitely exists an issue to Berkshires involvement with

1436
01:16:07,551 --> 01:16:08,063
The back

1437
01:16:08,575 --> 01:16:12,671
There's definitely some

1438
01:16:12,927 --> 01:16:14,463
2007 timeframe

1439
01:16:14,719 --> 01:16:17,791
Imagine

1440
01:16:18,559 --> 01:16:22,399
I was just desperate to lash out his imagined enemies to the point out right now

1441
01:16:22,655 --> 01:16:23,679
Make false accusation

1442
01:16:23,935 --> 01:16:26,495
Because he's been trained that there are no consequences for that

1443
01:16:27,007 --> 01:16:29,311
Bump it is too busy to sue Alex or this

1444
01:16:29,567 --> 01:16:31,615
Clear instance of defamation Alex knows it

1445
01:16:32,127 --> 01:16:37,503
There's just enough reality to the story that Wachovia did get in trouble for laundering drug money in 2010

1446
01:16:37,759 --> 01:16:42,111
Alex knows that his listeners will find a headline about that inside that out the story about it is true

1447
01:16:42,367 --> 01:16:45,951
You just a most pampered of radio personalities when you get right down to it

1448
01:16:46,207 --> 01:16:48,511
Easy easiest f****** job imaginable

1449
01:16:49,023 --> 01:16:52,607
Yeah just like too frustrating and times

1450
01:16:52,863 --> 01:16:53,887
Consuming to sue him

1451
01:16:55,167 --> 01:16:57,727
Just a trained audience full of people who has died

1452
01:16:57,983 --> 01:17:00,031
Oh he is right I saw headline

1453
01:17:03,103 --> 01:17:03,871
People would not

1454
01:17:04,127 --> 01:17:05,663
Appreciate our show if we just

1455
01:17:05,919 --> 01:17:07,711
Listed people and talked about what

1456
01:17:07,967 --> 01:17:08,479
Play War

1457
01:17:08,735 --> 01:17:11,039
Might want to consider it cuz I think of easier

1458
01:17:11,295 --> 01:17:17,439
What time coming

1459
01:17:18,719 --> 01:17:22,815
McConnell

1460
01:17:23,071 --> 01:17:26,143
Sevens on his stuff and that's obviously

1461
01:17:26,399 --> 01:17:30,751
The unrestrained whatever real devil

1462
01:17:36,383 --> 01:17:39,199
So Alex is another story

1463
01:17:39,455 --> 01:17:41,247
Thankfully it has nothing to do with the color pink

1464
01:17:41,759 --> 01:17:43,551
I was getting a little tired

1465
01:17:43,807 --> 01:17:45,343
Green

1466
01:17:45,855 --> 01:17:46,623
San Antonio

1467
01:17:47,647 --> 01:17:50,719
Pass the law last Thursday saying you'll be arrested if you say

1468
01:17:53,279 --> 01:17:55,839
Because the whocash Dozen

1469
01:17:56,095 --> 01:17:56,863
Come from China

1470
01:17:58,143 --> 01:18:00,447
I guess the WHIO can say the Moon is

1471
01:18:02,239 --> 01:18:02,751
Haha

1472
01:18:03,007 --> 01:18:09,151
So sweet to San Antonio city council passed a resolution that just roundly denounced the use of the term Chinese virus

1473
01:18:09,407 --> 01:18:10,943
Send Kung Fu virus

1474
01:18:11,711 --> 01:18:13,759
The resolution does it say lb arrest

1475
01:18:14,015 --> 01:18:14,783
Before using this term

1476
01:18:15,039 --> 01:18:20,415
It's really more just a declaration of a commitment to protect the safety and dignity of the Asian residents of the city

1477
01:18:20,927 --> 01:18:24,767
I'll just bring this up to your but there's also a business resolution about anti-semitism

1478
01:18:25,535 --> 01:18:28,351
Which has been marked by a bunch of people on the extreme right-wing

1479
01:18:28,863 --> 01:18:29,887
They say you need drink

1480
01:18:30,143 --> 01:18:31,167
The Pretender

1481
01:18:31,423 --> 01:18:32,191
Just crazy

1482
01:18:32,447 --> 01:18:34,495
Housing Chinese virus anti-Semitic

1483
01:18:34,751 --> 01:18:37,311
Looney left-wing safespace nuts are out of

1484
01:18:37,567 --> 01:18:38,079
Control

1485
01:18:38,591 --> 01:18:39,615
And the revolution

1486
01:18:40,127 --> 01:18:41,663
Quickly spells that out if you actually read it

1487
01:18:42,175 --> 01:18:42,943
Reading is hard for the

1488
01:18:43,455 --> 01:18:45,759
In the preamble to the resolution they include

1489
01:18:46,015 --> 01:18:49,855
Whereas the Jewish Community has been targeted with blame hate anti-semitic trope

1490
01:18:50,111 --> 01:18:51,391
Conspiracy theories about there

1491
01:18:51,647 --> 01:18:52,415
Creating spreading

1492
01:18:52,671 --> 01:18:54,463
And profiting from covid-19

1493
01:18:54,975 --> 01:18:55,999
The city council's make

1494
01:18:56,255 --> 01:18:59,839
Nature propaganda surrounding covid-19

1495
01:19:00,095 --> 01:19:03,935
Ross opens the door to the very people relying on those ancients meditropin

1496
01:19:04,191 --> 01:19:04,959
Conspiracy theories

1497
01:19:05,215 --> 01:19:06,495
Play Dom and pretend they don't

1498
01:19:06,751 --> 01:19:07,775
Get the point

1499
01:19:08,031 --> 01:19:12,127
They're always going to do that anyway man my birthday the first thing my dad

1500
01:19:12,639 --> 01:19:13,151
Send me that morning

1501
01:19:17,759 --> 01:19:18,527
Like

1502
01:19:19,295 --> 01:19:20,831
Hey how you doing with the

1503
01:19:21,087 --> 01:19:24,671
Kung flu and I texted him back I was like I would appreciate it if you didn't

1504
01:19:26,207 --> 01:19:27,999
Yeah thanks happy birthday

1505
01:19:28,255 --> 01:19:29,023
Look up fuctupmike

1506
01:19:29,279 --> 01:19:31,839
Like really funny

1507
01:19:32,095 --> 01:19:37,983
And I was like please don't I would appreciate you didn't do that and then you text back it is what it is and I have not spoken to him

1508
01:19:38,239 --> 01:19:39,263
Since then

1509
01:19:42,591 --> 01:19:47,455
In my head all day writing this whole like the only reason that you associate

1510
01:19:47,711 --> 01:19:49,759
Diseases with a certain group of people is

1511
01:19:50,015 --> 01:19:51,807
Set the groundwork for a program later

1512
01:19:52,063 --> 01:19:54,111
And I

1513
01:19:54,367 --> 01:19:56,415
There's just no way to deal with

1514
01:19:56,927 --> 01:19:58,719
I'm sorry to hear that

1515
01:19:58,975 --> 01:20:00,255
Photo bomber

1516
01:20:01,535 --> 01:20:02,303
So I don't think

1517
01:20:08,959 --> 01:20:09,727
More.

1518
01:20:12,031 --> 01:20:16,640
So I don't think it's the World Health organization's ever said that the virus didn't originate in China it's just

1519
01:20:16,896 --> 01:20:21,504
Calling it The China virus

1520
01:20:22,272 --> 01:20:28,416
In the preamble to the resolution they say quote whereas covid-19 will not be stopped by political

1521
01:20:28,672 --> 01:20:31,488
Created or caused by any race nationality or ethnicity

1522
01:20:31,744 --> 01:20:35,328
And the World Health Organization has cautioned against using Geographic descriptors

1523
01:20:35,584 --> 01:20:37,120
Naked racial discrimination

1524
01:20:37,632 --> 01:20:39,936
That's the only time the World Health Organization comes up

1525
01:20:40,192 --> 01:20:41,472
Who makes perfect

1526
01:20:43,008 --> 01:20:49,152
San Antonio City Council

1527
01:20:50,688 --> 01:20:51,200
Works better for him

1528
01:20:51,968 --> 01:20:53,504
If you're keeping score

1529
01:20:53,760 --> 01:20:55,808
Any 16-second clip that we listen

1530
01:20:56,064 --> 01:20:57,856
Come to light about the idea that

1531
01:20:58,112 --> 01:20:59,392
This Revolution was a bill to a rat

1532
01:20:59,648 --> 01:21:00,928
Chinese virus

1533
01:21:01,440 --> 01:21:05,792
Organization saying the virus didn't originate in China

1534
01:21:06,048 --> 01:21:07,072
Like he's trying to set record

1535
01:21:08,608 --> 01:21:10,144
I am speed

1536
01:21:10,400 --> 01:21:13,472
I mean in even in the even in the function of their

1537
01:21:13,728 --> 01:21:14,752
Conspiracy theory

1538
01:21:15,264 --> 01:21:16,032
Even if the

1539
01:21:16,288 --> 01:21:17,056
Chinese government

1540
01:21:17,312 --> 01:21:21,920
Somehow created this and then released it it's not the Chinese people

1541
01:21:25,760 --> 01:21:27,296
From you associating it with

1542
01:21:28,064 --> 01:21:29,600
What is what's going to happen

1543
01:21:29,856 --> 01:21:32,416
The people who are going to get f***** up

1544
01:21:32,672 --> 01:21:34,976
Become flu is going to really

1545
01:21:35,232 --> 01:21:39,072
Yeah yeah yeah just going to be somebody across the f***

1546
01:21:39,328 --> 01:21:40,096
Street from you

1547
01:21:40,352 --> 01:21:46,496
Guitar rest for the rest of the goddamn the consequence that you're willing

1548
01:21:46,752 --> 01:21:48,288
Existence

1549
01:21:49,312 --> 01:21:53,408
The Chinese government isn't going to be affected by you call

1550
01:21:53,920 --> 01:21:54,432
Cool

1551
01:21:54,688 --> 01:21:55,200
So

1552
01:21:55,712 --> 01:21:57,504
A rocky start

1553
01:21:58,016 --> 01:22:03,904
Water focus on pancake and we can move on

1554
01:22:04,928 --> 01:22:08,512
Little pink shirt

1555
01:22:08,768 --> 01:22:10,048
I am wearing

1556
01:22:12,096 --> 01:22:13,120
It's all show that

1557
01:22:15,424 --> 01:22:15,936
I'm wearing pink

1558
01:22:16,448 --> 01:22:17,472
Oh my God

1559
01:22:18,752 --> 01:22:19,776
Is this is

1560
01:22:20,032 --> 01:22:21,312
Very desperate

1561
01:22:21,568 --> 01:22:23,616
Salmonella

1562
01:22:23,872 --> 01:22:24,640
Clips are we going to get

1563
01:22:25,152 --> 01:22:27,456
Pink shirt I might be done

1564
01:22:27,712 --> 01:22:28,224
For now

1565
01:22:28,480 --> 01:22:30,784
Really funny cuz David Icke

1566
01:22:31,296 --> 01:22:31,808
Is on the show

1567
01:22:32,064 --> 01:22:33,344
So you can comes up later

1568
01:22:33,856 --> 01:22:36,160
David Icke

1569
01:22:36,672 --> 01:22:37,440
Sweater

1570
01:22:38,720 --> 01:22:40,768
Bill Gates

1571
01:22:41,792 --> 01:22:44,608
And what will revisit that

1572
01:22:44,864 --> 01:22:51,008
Some headlines from the way he's delivering

1573
01:22:51,264 --> 01:22:54,592
For any of this

1574
01:22:55,104 --> 01:22:58,688
Coronavirus spread

1575
01:23:18,912 --> 01:23:21,984
Depending on the graph there 50

1576
01:23:22,240 --> 01:23:27,872
Lower covid-19 death rate than they predicting the very same groups now

1577
01:23:28,896 --> 01:23:30,176
All these new fake numbers

1578
01:23:32,480 --> 01:23:32,992
Predicting

1579
01:23:34,528 --> 01:23:35,808
Millions more cases because

1580
01:23:41,952 --> 01:23:47,072
Invoice better Public Health crisis because

1581
01:23:47,328 --> 01:23:51,168
He also can't ignore them

1582
01:23:52,448 --> 01:23:58,592
What about the virus rates in Germany I'm just going to leave that alone not because I don't care but because it's kind of complicated and secondary

1583
01:24:01,408 --> 01:24:04,992
Camp not address the fact that Mike Pence's staffer Katie Miller test

1584
01:24:05,248 --> 01:24:06,272
Positive for covid-19

1585
01:24:07,040 --> 01:24:11,904
Too big of a story that he doesn't have to play catch-up

1586
01:24:12,672 --> 01:24:13,440
If she wasn't sex

1587
01:24:13,952 --> 01:24:16,256
Possibly exposed to the virus

1588
01:24:16,512 --> 01:24:18,304
Including most of the executive branch leadership

1589
01:24:19,072 --> 01:24:22,144
Miller's husband is Stephen Miller advisor to Trump

1590
01:24:23,168 --> 01:24:23,680
Pence

1591
01:24:24,192 --> 01:24:28,800
This could be a disease Vector the touches a whole lot of folks and some of them like Trump

1592
01:24:29,056 --> 01:24:30,592
In high-risk population

1593
01:24:31,104 --> 01:24:33,152
But the virus is not something that Alex

1594
01:24:33,408 --> 01:24:33,920
I'm really ignore

1595
01:24:34,688 --> 01:24:35,968
Alex knows he has to touch on this

1596
01:24:36,224 --> 01:24:37,504
There's not much he can do

1597
01:24:38,272 --> 01:24:41,088
If he says that it's a globalist infected and try to get the truck

1598
01:24:41,344 --> 01:24:42,880
This basically in assassination of

1599
01:24:43,392 --> 01:24:45,952
Escalation of his

1600
01:24:46,208 --> 01:24:46,976
Probably shouldn't make

1601
01:24:47,488 --> 01:24:51,584
The globalists are trying to kill the president. Well guess what

1602
01:24:51,840 --> 01:24:57,984
It's fine if you or Alex

1603
01:24:59,008 --> 01:25:05,152
Attempt on the president's life

1604
01:25:05,664 --> 01:25:06,688
He knows that stained

1605
01:25:06,944 --> 01:25:08,480
What are you left with

1606
01:25:08,736 --> 01:25:12,320
There's no real option for covering that story other than

1607
01:25:12,832 --> 01:25:16,160
This is like a bully was no comeback resorts to doing a dumb voice

1608
01:25:16,416 --> 01:25:16,928
Like that makes

1609
01:25:17,440 --> 01:25:22,048
Like that makes

1610
01:25:22,560 --> 01:25:25,632
That last story there is with his pattern is really on

1611
01:25:25,888 --> 01:25:26,400
Display

1612
01:25:26,912 --> 01:25:30,496
How does absolutely no good explanation for administration

1613
01:25:30,752 --> 01:25:32,288
Buried that CDC report

1614
01:25:33,056 --> 01:25:36,384
And where he's talking about it makes it clear that Alex doesn't actually even understand the story

1615
01:25:36,896 --> 01:25:38,944
Alex seems to think it is a story that has something to do with

1616
01:25:39,200 --> 01:25:40,480
Projections and grants

1617
01:25:40,736 --> 01:25:43,296
In reality the report the Trump shelves was quote

1618
01:25:43,552 --> 01:25:47,136
Detailed advice from the nation's top Disease Control experts for reopen

1619
01:25:47,392 --> 01:25:47,904
Communities

1620
01:25:48,160 --> 01:25:49,696
During coronavirus pandemic

1621
01:25:50,720 --> 01:25:56,864
Presumably he came out with a detail

1622
01:25:57,120 --> 01:25:59,168
Help communities do just that

1623
01:25:59,424 --> 01:26:01,728
And then the White House Shelter report on April 3rd

1624
01:26:02,240 --> 01:26:04,032
Weird

1625
01:26:05,568 --> 01:26:06,336
I think maybe

1626
01:26:06,592 --> 01:26:07,360
He

1627
01:26:07,616 --> 01:26:08,384
Agreed with the

1628
01:26:09,152 --> 01:26:09,920
I think

1629
01:26:10,176 --> 01:26:10,944
He was like

1630
01:26:11,712 --> 01:26:12,480
I don't like

1631
01:26:13,248 --> 01:26:17,088
Report card

1632
01:26:17,600 --> 01:26:19,904
Associated Press obtained emails

1633
01:26:20,160 --> 01:26:20,928
The head of the CDC

1634
01:26:21,184 --> 01:26:22,976
Redfield head approved this report

1635
01:26:23,232 --> 01:26:25,024
And sent it to the White House for approval

1636
01:26:25,280 --> 01:26:25,792
But they killed it

1637
01:26:28,608 --> 01:26:30,144
Not even be allowed to post

1638
01:26:30,400 --> 01:26:30,912
The decision tree

1639
01:26:31,936 --> 01:26:36,544
On May 7th be Associated Press reported on this very document which looks really bad

1640
01:26:37,056 --> 01:26:39,360
Worse is that according to ABC News

1641
01:26:39,616 --> 01:26:44,736
Quote after the story ran the White House called the CDC in

1642
01:26:44,992 --> 01:26:47,040
Trees except churches

1643
01:26:47,552 --> 01:26:52,160
An email obtained by the Associated Press confirmed Thursday

1644
01:26:52,416 --> 01:26:54,720
Hours after the news broke

1645
01:26:54,976 --> 01:26:57,024
It's clear intention here and none of it's good

1646
01:26:57,536 --> 01:27:03,680
It's a sort of thing we're obviously Trump wanted to reopen everything is pretty Rush uncontrolled way

1647
01:27:03,936 --> 01:27:04,960
Was much more careful in measure

1648
01:27:05,472 --> 01:27:06,240
Would you be slower

1649
01:27:06,496 --> 01:27:07,008
Girl bummer

1650
01:27:07,776 --> 01:27:09,568
Instead of letting the expert advice be released

1651
01:27:09,824 --> 01:27:10,336
They covered it up

1652
01:27:10,592 --> 01:27:16,736
What's the evidence of the report was reported on by the Associated Press

1653
01:27:16,992 --> 01:27:18,016
The Manning Report.

1654
01:27:18,784 --> 01:27:23,904
Call pathetically transparent stuff and absolutely no good argument

1655
01:27:24,416 --> 01:27:26,720
Is a goal is to safely reopen the country

1656
01:27:26,976 --> 01:27:28,256
His actions make no sense

1657
01:27:28,768 --> 01:27:29,536
Thumbs up

1658
01:27:29,792 --> 01:27:31,840
Completely fictional version

1659
01:27:32,352 --> 01:27:34,144
With these narratives where you misrepresented

1660
01:27:34,400 --> 01:27:35,424
Projections from January

1661
01:27:35,936 --> 01:27:37,216
Who's the best you can do

1662
01:27:37,728 --> 01:27:40,288
I was reading headlines about a very serious thing

1663
01:27:40,544 --> 01:27:42,080
Stanford

1664
01:27:42,336 --> 01:27:44,128
Testing positive for the virus or Trump

1665
01:27:44,384 --> 01:27:46,944
Varying reports that could end up jeopardizing Public Health

1666
01:27:48,224 --> 01:27:48,736
Tone

1667
01:27:48,992 --> 01:27:49,760
Amanda wyss

1668
01:27:50,016 --> 01:27:52,832
Show anymore

1669
01:27:53,856 --> 01:27:54,368
Ridiculous

1670
01:27:54,624 --> 01:27:56,928
You can be very large and yet still be at

1671
01:27:57,184 --> 01:27:57,696
Child

1672
01:27:58,208 --> 01:27:58,976
Did you know that

1673
01:27:59,232 --> 01:28:03,584
Maturity

1674
01:28:03,840 --> 01:28:04,352
The head part

1675
01:28:04,864 --> 01:28:05,888
Doesn't doesn't

1676
01:28:06,656 --> 01:28:09,472
I don't know how you feel good about this work

1677
01:28:09,728 --> 01:28:12,544
Like I feel somebody

1678
01:28:13,568 --> 01:28:18,432
I tried pretty hard sometimes to walk away with

1679
01:28:19,200 --> 01:28:25,344
Better I can't imagine

1680
01:28:26,368 --> 01:28:26,880
Imagine what it feels

1681
01:28:27,648 --> 01:28:28,160
Freedom

1682
01:28:28,416 --> 01:28:29,696
It feels like.

1683
01:28:29,952 --> 01:28:30,464
LeapFrog

1684
01:28:38,144 --> 01:28:40,192
That's a great show thanks

1685
01:28:40,448 --> 01:28:41,216
Alright

1686
01:28:42,240 --> 01:28:43,008
So

1687
01:28:43,264 --> 01:28:43,776
In this

1688
01:28:44,544 --> 01:28:45,568
Episode

1689
01:28:45,824 --> 01:28:46,848
Keep saying

1690
01:28:47,104 --> 01:28:48,128
That he has like

1691
01:28:48,384 --> 01:28:50,688
Clips of Bill Gates saying that he wants

1692
01:28:50,944 --> 01:28:52,480
To kill children

1693
01:28:52,736 --> 01:28:53,504
Right

1694
01:28:54,528 --> 01:28:57,600
No you don't end up playing it

1695
01:29:00,672 --> 01:29:01,184
Of

1696
01:29:03,744 --> 01:29:05,024
Bill Gates talking about

1697
01:29:05,536 --> 01:29:08,352
Childhood death in depopulation and work vehicle

1698
01:29:09,376 --> 01:29:10,656
I'll get rid of all people

1699
01:29:27,296 --> 01:29:27,808
Very well

1700
01:29:32,672 --> 01:29:33,440
Nutrition

1701
01:29:38,560 --> 01:29:39,072
Very well

1702
01:29:41,888 --> 01:29:44,192
Reduce

1703
01:29:44,448 --> 01:29:46,496
Thinking he says produce

1704
01:29:47,008 --> 01:29:48,032
Play the clip

1705
01:29:48,544 --> 01:29:51,104
Again

1706
01:29:53,152 --> 01:29:57,504
Because they play it slow down and it tells

1707
01:30:03,136 --> 01:30:03,648
Wow

1708
01:30:04,672 --> 01:30:06,976
This is the Smoking Gun the Bill Gates

1709
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:09,280
Excited while talking about

1710
01:30:09,536 --> 01:30:10,816
Producing

1711
01:30:11,328 --> 01:30:15,168
Uh did Geraldo just open of what the f*** has happened there

1712
01:30:15,424 --> 01:30:16,704
That is wild

1713
01:30:17,984 --> 01:30:19,264
Did he not

1714
01:30:19,520 --> 01:30:21,824
Listen to it before the show

1715
01:30:22,080 --> 01:30:22,592
I mean

1716
01:30:23,104 --> 01:30:24,640
I don't know they could be motivated

1717
01:30:24,896 --> 01:30:27,456
Hearing tell yourself

1718
01:30:27,712 --> 01:30:31,040
Like if I told myself to hear produce there I probably could

1719
01:30:32,320 --> 01:30:37,696
Pretty clear you saying take a lot of mental effort

1720
01:30:37,952 --> 01:30:39,232
Yeah you got a really water

1721
01:30:40,256 --> 01:30:42,048
So it is next clip Alex

1722
01:30:42,304 --> 01:30:48,448
Gets to the issues surrounding the Justice dropping case against General Flynn

1723
01:30:48,704 --> 01:30:50,752
Very clear intent on

1724
01:30:51,008 --> 01:30:53,312
Where's part two crime

1725
01:30:53,568 --> 01:30:55,872
Hero now he's covering it up because that's what he's

1726
01:30:56,640 --> 01:30:57,664
Irrelevant

1727
01:30:57,920 --> 01:30:58,944
The Cobra Golf crime

1728
01:30:59,200 --> 01:30:59,968
Literally why

1729
01:31:00,224 --> 01:31:04,576
The only reason you hire Bill Baris to cover up.

1730
01:31:04,832 --> 01:31:06,880
Hero no I'm pretty sure that

1731
01:31:07,392 --> 01:31:08,928
Admitted to lying to the FBI

1732
01:31:11,488 --> 01:31:14,816
Crimes in that in covering this story

1733
01:31:16,096 --> 01:31:17,120
Chuck Todd

1734
01:31:19,424 --> 01:31:19,936
Right

1735
01:31:20,704 --> 01:31:22,496
Situation coming out

1736
01:31:24,544 --> 01:31:25,056
With

1737
01:31:25,568 --> 01:31:26,336
Errol Flynn

1738
01:31:27,872 --> 01:31:29,152
And some of the Articles dealing with that

1739
01:31:30,176 --> 01:31:31,456
Infowars.com

1740
01:31:32,480 --> 01:31:35,296
Now even the doj is slamming NBC's truck

1741
01:31:37,344 --> 01:31:38,368
AG Barr interview

1742
01:31:39,392 --> 01:31:40,672
How's that feel bar

1743
01:31:41,952 --> 01:31:44,256
When the media lies about what you say

1744
01:31:51,680 --> 01:31:54,496
New York legal action against

1745
01:31:55,520 --> 01:31:56,032
Say that

1746
01:31:57,568 --> 01:31:58,592
Covid-19 treatment

1747
01:31:59,360 --> 01:32:00,640
Any such thing

1748
01:32:00,896 --> 01:32:01,664
Kind of dead

1749
01:32:01,920 --> 01:32:06,272
Just got to make it about yourself got to make

1750
01:32:06,784 --> 01:32:12,416
Chuck Todd Meet the Press General Barr history look back on this

1751
01:32:12,672 --> 01:32:14,464
Decision

1752
01:32:14,976 --> 01:32:20,864
All the show Bars response was well history is written by the winners so it depends on who's writing the history

1753
01:32:21,632 --> 01:32:23,680
The full answer the bar gate was closed

1754
01:32:23,936 --> 01:32:27,520
Well history is written by the winners so it largely depends on who's writing the history

1755
01:32:28,032 --> 01:32:32,128
But I think a fair history would say that it was a good decision because it upheld the rule of law

1756
01:32:32,640 --> 01:32:36,992
It helped it upheld the standards of the Department of Justice and it was a ninja

1757
01:32:38,016 --> 01:32:38,784
I see both sides

1758
01:32:40,064 --> 01:32:44,928
Chuck Todd very clearly contacts

1759
01:32:45,184 --> 01:32:46,976
It's very hard for me to imagine that

1760
01:32:47,232 --> 01:32:47,744
The decision

1761
01:32:48,768 --> 01:32:49,280
So f*** him

1762
01:32:49,792 --> 01:32:52,096
But that being said even with the full context

1763
01:32:52,352 --> 01:32:54,912
Comedies f****** chilling and scary

1764
01:32:55,424 --> 01:32:56,704
His first thought is still the

1765
01:32:56,960 --> 01:32:58,240
History is written by the winners

1766
01:32:58,496 --> 01:33:01,824
Good decision based on the

1767
01:33:02,080 --> 01:33:03,616
History witch

1768
01:33:04,128 --> 01:33:07,200
Feels kind of like rationalization of the immediate answer

1769
01:33:07,456 --> 01:33:10,016
That even though he must have realized under the

1770
01:33:10,272 --> 01:33:16,416
Villainous a little bit like well so long as we remain in power forever

1771
01:33:16,672 --> 01:33:17,696
I think it'll be a great day

1772
01:33:17,952 --> 01:33:19,232
Decision guys

1773
01:33:19,488 --> 01:33:22,560
Even with the

1774
01:33:23,840 --> 01:33:24,352
Doesn't

1775
01:33:24,608 --> 01:33:25,120
Excuse

1776
01:33:25,376 --> 01:33:27,936
Why Chuck Todd

1777
01:33:28,192 --> 01:33:29,216
Even though

1778
01:33:29,728 --> 01:33:30,752
I mean honestly

1779
01:33:31,008 --> 01:33:31,520
I don't

1780
01:33:31,776 --> 01:33:34,336
Think it matters because the rest of it was a liar

1781
01:33:35,872 --> 01:33:36,896
No no

1782
01:33:37,152 --> 01:33:38,944
Even Bill Barr in his heart

1783
01:33:39,200 --> 01:33:39,968
Can possibly believe

1784
01:33:40,736 --> 01:33:41,504
That what

1785
01:33:41,760 --> 01:33:43,040
He did would be treated

1786
01:33:43,296 --> 01:33:44,064
Fairly by history

1787
01:33:45,600 --> 01:33:46,624
But at the same time

1788
01:33:47,392 --> 01:33:49,184
Jeers must go to Chuck Todd

1789
01:33:49,440 --> 01:33:55,584
I don't even care I don't even think in terms of like being

1790
01:33:55,840 --> 01:33:57,120
Jennifer actor

1791
01:33:57,376 --> 01:33:57,888
Get the thing

1792
01:33:59,424 --> 01:34:03,520
Presented misrepresentation because Chuck Todd did also say that he didn't

1793
01:34:03,776 --> 01:34:07,872
Justify this based on the rule of law

1794
01:34:08,128 --> 01:34:08,640
Concrete

1795
01:34:08,896 --> 01:34:09,920
Misrepresentation

1796
01:34:11,456 --> 01:34:12,992
Spirit

1797
01:34:13,248 --> 01:34:15,552
That's not right

1798
01:34:15,808 --> 01:34:17,344
No I understand

1799
01:34:17,856 --> 01:34:19,904
My my feeling is

1800
01:34:20,928 --> 01:34:23,744
Getting abused

1801
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:24,768
By being fair

1802
01:34:25,024 --> 01:34:27,584
Buspar

1803
01:34:27,840 --> 01:34:31,680
William Barr to pretend anything other than that he's covering up a crime

1804
01:34:31,936 --> 01:34:33,216
I'm abused by

1805
01:34:33,472 --> 01:34:36,800
I don't think I don't think I should have done an interview with him.

1806
01:34:37,056 --> 01:34:43,200
I can agree with that conclusion

1807
01:34:43,456 --> 01:34:47,040
To justify misrepresent the person on a new show

1808
01:34:47,296 --> 01:34:49,344
Butyrate the entire

1809
01:34:49,600 --> 01:34:50,624
Queen of what you're doing

1810
01:34:50,880 --> 01:34:54,976
In the process you don't get fire powers

1811
01:34:55,488 --> 01:34:57,536
People that would provide cover for the cover-up

1812
01:34:57,792 --> 01:34:59,328
Or whatever I think it's

1813
01:34:59,584 --> 01:35:00,096
I don't know

1814
01:35:01,120 --> 01:35:02,656
My issues letting him talk in the first

1815
01:35:07,776 --> 01:35:09,568
I don't know justify

1816
01:35:09,824 --> 01:35:11,360
Sacha Baron Cohen

1817
01:35:15,968 --> 01:35:18,528
But while we're on the subject of things being taken out of context

1818
01:35:19,040 --> 01:35:24,928
I should bring up they want to be major sources of justification for the Department of Justice dropping their case against Michael Flynn

1819
01:35:25,184 --> 01:35:28,512
Pokemon said that her words are being used inappropriately it support

1820
01:35:28,768 --> 01:35:30,048
Conclusion she actually opposed

1821
01:35:31,072 --> 01:35:36,704
Attorney general for National Security New York Times that includes the following

1822
01:35:37,216 --> 01:35:37,728
Quote

1823
01:35:37,984 --> 01:35:41,568
Attempting to support its argument insights more than 25 times

1824
01:35:41,824 --> 01:35:43,872
The FBI's report of an interview with me

1825
01:35:44,128 --> 01:35:45,408
In July 2017

1826
01:35:46,176 --> 01:35:50,016
My interview is no support for mr. bars dismissal of Flynn's case

1827
01:35:50,528 --> 01:35:54,112
It does not suggest that the FBI had no counterintelligence reason for invest

1828
01:35:54,368 --> 01:35:55,136
Navigating mr. Flynn

1829
01:35:55,648 --> 01:35:58,464
It does not suggest that the FBI's interview with mr. Flynn

1830
01:35:58,720 --> 01:36:01,792
Would you like to the false statements charged with unlawful or unjust

1831
01:36:02,560 --> 01:36:05,120
It does not support that Mr Flynn's.

1832
01:36:05,376 --> 01:36:06,400
Material

1833
01:36:07,424 --> 01:36:08,192
Justice is assertion

1834
01:36:08,704 --> 01:36:09,984
Continue prosecution

1835
01:36:10,240 --> 01:36:11,520
The case against Mr Flynn

1836
01:36:11,776 --> 01:36:13,568
Who pleaded guilty to knowingly making

1837
01:36:13,824 --> 01:36:15,872
Materially false statements to the FBI

1838
01:36:16,128 --> 01:36:17,152
Would not serve the address

1839
01:36:19,456 --> 01:36:20,736
The working Theory

1840
01:36:20,992 --> 01:36:23,552
Legal experts is that there was not good cause

1841
01:36:23,808 --> 01:36:27,136
To drop the case against Department of Justice

1842
01:36:27,392 --> 01:36:28,160
Macavity argument

1843
01:36:28,416 --> 01:36:29,440
In order to avoid Trump

1844
01:36:29,696 --> 01:36:30,464
Trying to Pardon him

1845
01:36:30,720 --> 01:36:32,000
Which would have been a real klusterfuk

1846
01:36:32,256 --> 01:36:32,768
Would have been

1847
01:36:34,560 --> 01:36:36,096
In Trump's Administration would want

1848
01:36:36,352 --> 01:36:36,864
To try and do

1849
01:36:37,376 --> 01:36:37,888
They will

1850
01:36:38,144 --> 01:36:40,704
Well

1851
01:36:41,728 --> 01:36:45,568
Justice argue

1852
01:36:46,592 --> 01:36:48,896
Which is to say that they were irrelevant to other cases

1853
01:36:49,152 --> 01:36:50,944
And therefore lying about those things

1854
01:36:51,968 --> 01:36:57,344
This is not a very solid argument internet

1855
01:36:57,600 --> 01:36:58,880
The Hobbit.

1856
01:36:59,136 --> 01:36:59,648
Conclusion

1857
01:36:59,904 --> 01:37:02,464
Last we don't live in the same world and so here we are

1858
01:37:03,232 --> 01:37:05,280
I'm here again we have Alex looking up to Bill Barr

1859
01:37:05,792 --> 01:37:10,656
The guy who you should absolutely unequivocally hate for

1860
01:37:10,912 --> 01:37:12,704
And all of the issues that it careers

1861
01:37:13,216 --> 01:37:15,008
Just don't understand how

1862
01:37:15,264 --> 01:37:15,776
It wasn't

1863
01:37:16,032 --> 01:37:19,104
Immediately an arrestable offense to hire Bill Barr

1864
01:37:19,872 --> 01:37:26,016
Should be ready literally like saying

1865
01:37:26,272 --> 01:37:32,416
It was the previous

1866
01:37:32,672 --> 01:37:35,488
I hired something completely fractured Trump

1867
01:37:35,744 --> 01:37:41,888
Bass

1868
01:37:44,192 --> 01:37:45,472
Then I covered up all their crime

1869
01:37:49,312 --> 01:37:52,896
Navigation with

1870
01:37:53,152 --> 01:37:54,176
Problem

1871
01:37:54,432 --> 01:37:56,992
Patriot militia right way

1872
01:37:57,504 --> 01:37:58,272
They should have seen

1873
01:38:01,088 --> 01:38:02,624
A bit like if he does that we're out

1874
01:38:02,880 --> 01:38:08,000
MN Trump should be played it right cuz turns out they don't care

1875
01:38:10,816 --> 01:38:11,328
When they don't care

1876
01:38:11,584 --> 01:38:14,144
So you talking about cuz Alex

1877
01:38:14,400 --> 01:38:15,680
Favorite country or something

1878
01:38:15,936 --> 01:38:18,752
We talked about the death toll

1879
01:38:19,008 --> 01:38:20,544
Coronavirus in Sweden

1880
01:38:20,800 --> 01:38:22,336
Just make some stuff up

1881
01:38:23,616 --> 01:38:25,920
Dead sweet waiting for me

1882
01:38:27,456 --> 01:38:28,736
Pretty please cupcakes on top

1883
01:38:30,272 --> 01:38:32,320
3256

1884
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:40,512
3000

1885
01:38:50,240 --> 01:38:50,752
What does the new

1886
01:38:51,008 --> 01:38:52,032
European size

1887
01:39:00,480 --> 01:39:00,992
Coronavirus

1888
01:39:01,248 --> 01:39:02,528
The show is good

1889
01:39:03,296 --> 01:39:06,368
So we have two claims being made there

1890
01:39:07,136 --> 01:39:09,184
The first is that they were 15,000

1891
01:39:09,440 --> 01:39:10,720
Flu deaths in Sweden

1892
01:39:13,280 --> 01:39:16,352
Pushed about the 2019 flu season

1893
01:39:16,608 --> 01:39:20,704
1757

1894
01:39:20,960 --> 01:39:21,728
Total

1895
01:39:22,240 --> 01:39:25,056
You've got seems to be a little bit High

1896
01:39:26,080 --> 01:39:29,664
They reported 505 of these people died within 30 days

1897
01:39:29,920 --> 01:39:30,688
Other diagnosis

1898
01:39:30,944 --> 01:39:31,968
Give you some idea of the

1899
01:39:32,224 --> 01:39:32,736
The scale

1900
01:39:33,248 --> 01:39:37,344
In the 2011 20/20 season the death girl almost hit 1000

1901
01:39:37,600 --> 01:39:41,696
Invitation I can find out to just making up that number about Swedish food at

1902
01:39:42,208 --> 01:39:46,048
If it's number were accurate and you applied that rate based on Sweden population

1903
01:39:47,072 --> 01:39:49,888
We would have about four hundred and ninety-two thousand

1904
01:39:50,144 --> 01:39:51,168
Flu deaths per year

1905
01:39:51,424 --> 01:39:53,216
Which again leads me to believe that I was just making

1906
01:39:57,056 --> 01:40:02,176
Maybe he just saw they had about 14,000 cases last year and he's misrepresenting that Miss

1907
01:40:02,432 --> 01:40:03,200
Reporting it as death

1908
01:40:03,456 --> 01:40:05,248
Whatever the case he's just presented bad in

1909
01:40:05,504 --> 01:40:07,296
Information to his audience Authority

1910
01:40:07,552 --> 01:40:13,696
Is lame yeah also Alex is going there's no cases of flu being reported because they're all being called covid-19

1911
01:40:13,952 --> 01:40:14,464
Complete lie

1912
01:40:14,720 --> 01:40:16,000
You can easily find Daytona

1913
01:40:16,256 --> 01:40:20,352
The cdc's website that reflects newly reported cases of influenza there confirmed each week

1914
01:40:21,120 --> 01:40:22,656
The number is going drastically downward

1915
01:40:22,912 --> 01:40:23,680
Because flu season is

1916
01:40:23,936 --> 01:40:24,448
Pretty much over

1917
01:40:24,704 --> 01:40:27,776
Heather usually ends around you know like the end of March or in April

1918
01:40:28,544 --> 01:40:32,640
They're still 21 new cases in week 18 of 2020 which ended May 2nd

1919
01:40:33,152 --> 01:40:34,944
26 cases the week prior

1920
01:40:35,712 --> 01:40:39,808
You can find week-by-week data for influenza-related deaths on the website

1921
01:40:40,064 --> 01:40:43,904
Week 18 had 20 baths and week 17 at 106

1922
01:40:44,160 --> 01:40:46,208
If you look at their data for previous years

1923
01:40:46,464 --> 01:40:47,744
Pretty much

1924
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:48,512
Common pattern

1925
01:40:48,768 --> 01:40:49,280
A flu season

1926
01:40:49,792 --> 01:40:50,560
Workouts

1927
01:40:50,816 --> 01:40:52,352
Increases the season begins

1928
01:40:52,608 --> 01:40:55,168
Another gradually go down as we come to the end of the season

1929
01:40:55,680 --> 01:41:01,824
Is drop typically comes in week 16 to 19 of the year and sometimes a little bit

1930
01:41:02,848 --> 01:41:08,480
Just calling all flu deaths covid-19

1931
01:41:08,736 --> 01:41:09,248
Health officials are

1932
01:41:09,504 --> 01:41:10,528
Still counting flu deaths

1933
01:41:10,784 --> 01:41:15,392
Alta just making this up because it's important to minimize the danger covid-19

1934
01:41:15,648 --> 01:41:16,672
Because he's a lazy

1935
01:41:17,184 --> 01:41:17,696
Can fraud

1936
01:41:19,232 --> 01:41:23,584
Which makes me actually kind of Alex basically just admits his life

1937
01:41:23,840 --> 01:41:24,864
Life's work has amount

1938
01:41:36,896 --> 01:41:37,664
Giving up on phone

1939
01:41:38,688 --> 01:41:40,224
God

1940
01:41:40,480 --> 01:41:41,504
Trying to fix things

1941
01:41:42,272 --> 01:41:43,040
We failed

1942
01:41:44,064 --> 01:41:44,832
Psychometrist level

1943
01:41:45,088 --> 01:41:46,624
You'll be a biological weapon attack

1944
01:41:49,696 --> 01:41:50,976
Endgame

1945
01:41:51,744 --> 01:41:52,512
2007

1946
01:41:55,584 --> 01:41:56,352
But you failed

1947
01:41:58,400 --> 01:41:59,936
Stop

1948
01:42:01,984 --> 01:42:02,496
Yeah that's

1949
01:42:02,752 --> 01:42:03,520
What's that

1950
01:42:03,776 --> 01:42:07,616
Yeah he's accomplished nothing in his entire life

1951
01:42:07,872 --> 01:42:11,200
You should be ashamed of himself for being

1952
01:42:11,456 --> 01:42:17,600
What are things that started his own reality reality

1953
01:42:17,856 --> 01:42:18,880
He's a massive destruct

1954
01:42:19,392 --> 01:42:20,928
Failure

1955
01:42:22,208 --> 01:42:23,744
Alex's operation is doomed

1956
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:25,024
The failure to begin with

1957
01:42:25,280 --> 01:42:26,304
Because it doesn't mean

1958
01:42:26,816 --> 01:42:30,912
Like none of the stuff he's talking about goes anywhere it's all bulshit

1959
01:42:31,424 --> 01:42:32,448
Musically if you have smart

1960
01:42:32,704 --> 01:42:35,008
Engage competent people in your audience

1961
01:42:35,520 --> 01:42:40,384
They're going to end up looking into the things that you say and eventually

1962
01:42:40,640 --> 01:42:42,944
Be able to retain a decent audio

1963
01:42:43,456 --> 01:42:44,480
Engaged

1964
01:42:44,736 --> 01:42:45,248
Critical

1965
01:42:46,528 --> 01:42:47,040
In the audience

1966
01:42:47,296 --> 01:42:48,320
Text self-select

1967
01:42:48,576 --> 01:42:51,136
For people who are gullible or baby dumb

1968
01:42:51,392 --> 01:42:52,672
Be your audio

1969
01:42:54,464 --> 01:42:58,560
You have that as your space and eventually overtime

1970
01:42:58,816 --> 01:43:00,096
Maybe some of them will start

1971
01:43:00,352 --> 01:43:01,632
To realize that nothing ever

1972
01:43:02,656 --> 01:43:03,680
Realize

1973
01:43:06,752 --> 01:43:08,800
Disenchant some of the

1974
01:43:09,568 --> 01:43:12,128
Respond to this by

1975
01:43:12,384 --> 01:43:13,664
Turning off the critical thinker

1976
01:43:14,944 --> 01:43:19,040
Whatever Alex says is right is right

1977
01:43:19,552 --> 01:43:21,600
A hundred percent on the ride with him

1978
01:43:21,856 --> 01:43:28,000
Wherever it goes you can say they've given up and have failed in their

1979
01:43:28,256 --> 01:43:32,352
Whatever coldest Devotion to a war

1980
01:43:32,608 --> 01:43:33,120
The other

1981
01:43:33,632 --> 01:43:35,680
Subsets of people are going to be like

1982
01:43:36,448 --> 01:43:37,728
Alex is not doing it

1983
01:43:37,984 --> 01:43:39,264
We'll find some other

1984
01:43:39,520 --> 01:43:42,336
Conspiracy

1985
01:43:42,592 --> 01:43:43,872
Guru in that world

1986
01:43:44,128 --> 01:43:46,688
Also have a piece of their story be like

1987
01:43:46,944 --> 01:43:47,456
Hey

1988
01:43:47,712 --> 01:43:48,480
Alex

1989
01:43:48,736 --> 01:43:50,272
Is controlled opposition

1990
01:43:50,784 --> 01:43:52,064
Because that way

1991
01:43:52,320 --> 01:43:54,368
You can start being called by someone else

1992
01:43:54,880 --> 01:43:56,672
And pretend that they've woken up

1993
01:43:56,928 --> 01:43:59,744
Yep they can pretend

1994
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:00,512
Couponing them

1995
01:44:00,768 --> 01:44:01,792
This one isn't

1996
01:44:02,048 --> 01:44:05,888
And so now they're out of

1997
01:44:06,912 --> 01:44:08,704
Constantly Inward and outward

1998
01:44:09,728 --> 01:44:10,496
People who

1999
01:44:10,752 --> 01:44:13,056
Get tired of the b*******

2000
01:44:13,312 --> 01:44:16,640
And the only people who really stick around people who trained and coached

2001
01:44:16,896 --> 01:44:17,664
Turn off

2002
01:44:18,688 --> 01:44:19,456
Critical thinking

2003
01:44:19,712 --> 01:44:21,248
Capabilities

2004
01:44:21,504 --> 01:44:22,528
And that is not

2005
01:44:22,784 --> 01:44:23,296
I mean

2006
01:44:23,552 --> 01:44:26,368
You know you can go for quite a while apparently

2007
01:44:26,624 --> 01:44:28,416
Using that as a

2008
01:44:28,672 --> 01:44:29,696
Sumbitch

2009
01:44:31,232 --> 01:44:32,000
Eventually

2010
01:44:32,768 --> 01:44:33,280
You know

2011
01:44:33,792 --> 01:44:34,816
You're not going to be able to do much

2012
01:44:35,072 --> 01:44:35,584
Watch with it

2013
01:44:35,840 --> 01:44:37,120
Diminishing returns

2014
01:44:37,632 --> 01:44:39,936
The other things happen in your life like

2015
01:44:40,448 --> 01:44:46,592
You get sued by everybody to be able to maintain the standard of living

2016
01:44:46,848 --> 01:44:50,944
Become accustomed to your billion-dollar Studios

2017
01:44:51,200 --> 01:44:51,968
And all this s*** it

2018
01:44:52,480 --> 01:44:55,040
This is destined to fail

2019
01:44:55,552 --> 01:44:57,600
Is the system that needs to continue

2020
01:44:58,624 --> 01:44:59,136
Yeah

2021
01:44:59,392 --> 01:45:00,416
Content

2022
01:45:00,672 --> 01:45:01,440
The content

2023
01:45:01,696 --> 01:45:03,232
Definition is a spinning wheel

2024
01:45:03,744 --> 01:45:06,560
Yeah it is it's never going to get anywhere

2025
01:45:07,072 --> 01:45:11,936
And no matter how gullible you are sooner or later everybody wants to finally get

2026
01:45:12,704 --> 01:45:14,240
And they'll go somewhere else

2027
01:45:15,776 --> 01:45:17,568
And so the only people who are not going

2028
01:45:17,824 --> 01:45:18,592
To do that

2029
01:45:18,848 --> 01:45:20,128
Be people who don't have a chance

2030
01:45:20,384 --> 01:45:22,688
Began what kind of helpless to the

2031
01:45:23,200 --> 01:45:26,016
Fraud and manipulation that Alex

2032
01:45:26,528 --> 01:45:29,344
That's not going to be that's not going to be a basement

2033
01:45:29,600 --> 01:45:32,160
Is going to sustain you forever and furthermore it

2034
01:45:32,416 --> 01:45:33,440
It's not going to be like

2035
01:45:34,720 --> 01:45:35,744
2 releaf

2036
01:45:37,024 --> 01:45:37,536
Do any

2037
01:45:38,816 --> 01:45:44,960
Know if you can't get another generation into real

2038
01:45:45,216 --> 01:45:51,360
And there was a certain kind of be able to do that

2039
01:45:52,384 --> 01:45:57,504
Conspiracy propaganda he's not that anymore recruits

2040
01:45:57,760 --> 01:46:00,064
Minimize via social media

2041
01:46:01,856 --> 01:46:06,208
Inflow has been stymied as opposed to the outflow

2042
01:46:06,720 --> 01:46:11,584
Like it's just it's just screwed like

2043
01:46:12,608 --> 01:46:13,632
To the country

2044
01:46:13,888 --> 01:46:14,912
This is this is kind of

2045
01:46:18,240 --> 01:46:18,752
Began

2046
01:46:19,008 --> 01:46:24,384
Ya-ya-ya High highs

2047
01:46:26,688 --> 01:46:27,200
More or less

2048
01:46:27,712 --> 01:46:28,224
Because

2049
01:46:28,736 --> 01:46:29,248
Think it's impossible

2050
01:46:29,504 --> 01:46:31,296
Everything is so stupid that he saying

2051
01:46:31,552 --> 01:46:33,088
He can't possibly

2052
01:46:34,624 --> 01:46:35,392
Anybody

2053
01:46:35,648 --> 01:46:36,416
HughesNet

2054
01:46:38,464 --> 01:46:40,768
Vulnerable or an idiot to be a

2055
01:46:41,024 --> 01:46:41,792
Yeah yeah

2056
01:46:42,304 --> 01:46:43,840
I mean if you dissolve select

2057
01:46:52,288 --> 01:46:53,056
It's it's at

2058
01:46:54,336 --> 01:46:57,152
Paranoid perpetually in fear and paralyzed

2059
01:46:57,408 --> 01:46:57,920
Spy

2060
01:46:58,176 --> 01:46:59,456
Their slavish devotion

2061
01:46:59,712 --> 01:47:01,248
Into a guy who's supposed to be doing everything

2062
01:47:01,504 --> 01:47:02,016
Sing for them

2063
01:47:02,272 --> 01:47:07,648
Yeah and then think about how his business model also relies on self-selecting people who are gone

2064
01:47:08,160 --> 01:47:09,952
Because like you know placebo effect

2065
01:47:10,208 --> 01:47:10,720
What is his business

2066
01:47:17,632 --> 01:47:18,144
I'll be fine

2067
01:47:20,448 --> 01:47:23,520
Slowly poisoning use supplements everything will be fine

2068
01:47:23,776 --> 01:47:26,336
Those sorts of sales pitches are not

2069
01:47:26,592 --> 01:47:27,872
Things that you do with

2070
01:47:28,128 --> 01:47:29,664
An audience that is critical

2071
01:47:31,200 --> 01:47:32,480
Critically minded

2072
01:47:37,344 --> 01:47:43,488
What am I looking at

2073
01:47:43,744 --> 01:47:45,280
Scariest

2074
01:47:45,536 --> 01:47:49,888
I really need the burpees

2075
01:47:52,192 --> 01:47:52,704
Yeah it's

2076
01:47:53,984 --> 01:47:55,008
It's sad

2077
01:47:55,264 --> 01:47:56,032
What kind of bummed me out

2078
01:47:57,056 --> 01:48:01,152
Surprise coming up on this episode

2079
01:48:03,968 --> 01:48:07,552
You know San Antonio so they'll arrest you if you say the word Chinese

2080
01:48:08,064 --> 01:48:08,832
I hear it

2081
01:48:11,904 --> 01:48:12,672
Let's just say we got a

2082
01:48:12,928 --> 01:48:13,696
Price of our sleeves

2083
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:18,048
What's going on

2084
01:48:18,560 --> 01:48:19,584
Nothing happened

2085
01:48:20,096 --> 01:48:20,608
I don't know if

2086
01:48:20,864 --> 01:48:26,240
You play something later in the shower. Like I'm going to be

2087
01:48:27,776 --> 01:48:32,128
Like real lated to the San Antonio story

2088
01:48:32,640 --> 01:48:35,712
Swing for the fences on some Asian Bakery

2089
01:48:38,272 --> 01:48:39,552
I don't know what he was talking about

2090
01:48:39,808 --> 01:48:44,160
I expected him to have somebody in San Antonio saying racist s*** in front of a cop

2091
01:48:45,184 --> 01:48:51,072
That seems like the obvious thing for him to do nice out there

2092
01:48:52,864 --> 01:48:55,424
So Alex

2093
01:48:56,192 --> 01:48:57,728
No payoff to this that I'm aware of

2094
01:48:58,240 --> 01:49:01,824
Make

2095
01:49:02,336 --> 01:49:06,176
Okay go radio broadcast

2096
01:49:06,432 --> 01:49:06,944
Dido

01:49:07,200 --> 01:49:13,344
We'll figure it out the sales pitch products

2098
01:49:18,208 --> 01:49:18,720
Impact

2099
01:49:22,304 --> 01:49:23,840
Pictures of white burgundy in Friends

2100
01:49:24,352 --> 01:49:24,864

2101
01:49:29,984 --> 01:49:30,496
Percent off

2102
01:49:31,008 --> 01:49:32,544
The 8-pack powerstack is

2103
01:49:32,800 --> 01:49:34,080
13 pills

2104
01:49:34,592 --> 01:49:35,360
Is confusing

2105
01:49:35,872 --> 01:49:39,456
Infowars store to try and figure out what was up with as soon as it turns out

2106
01:49:39,712 --> 01:49:40,224
It's cold

2107
01:49:40,480 --> 01:49:41,504
Different formula

2108
01:49:42,016 --> 01:49:44,064
Lazar double pill

2109

Deflection

2110
01:49:46,368 --> 01:49:50,464
The nootropic brain and immune support formulas are each two pills

2111
01:49:50,720 --> 01:49:53,024
Where's the other six formulas are a single

2112
01:49:54,048 --> 01:49:57,120
If you do some simple bath

2113
01:49:57,376 --> 01:49:58,144
That is 12

2114
01:49:58,656 --> 01:50:03,776
There's even a visual on the website that shows each of the pills clearly 12 of them

2115
01:50:04,288 --> 01:50:06,080
Where's the 13th mystery Pale Ale

2116
01:50:06,336 --> 01:50:07,360
What are you hiding

2117
01:50:07,616 --> 01:50:11,200
Invisible

2118
01:50:11,456 --> 01:50:14,784
And info Warriors can see

2119
01:50:15,296 --> 01:50:17,344
Is that right yeah they don't put it on the website

2120
01:50:17,600 --> 01:50:18,368
Because I'm just anybody

2121
01:50:18,624 --> 01:50:22,208
I could see it then you got to order it and then if you're man enough

2122
01:50:22,464 --> 01:50:23,744
Kingsville will manifest

2123
01:50:25,024 --> 01:50:26,304
Man manifest

2124
01:50:26,560 --> 01:50:27,072
Makes perfect

2125
01:50:27,584 --> 01:50:30,912
Yeah you're right I should have thought of that

2126
01:50:31,680 --> 01:50:33,984
Also it's called a pack power stack

2127
01:50:34,240 --> 01:50:35,008
There are nine

2128
01:50:38,080 --> 01:50:39,104

As for

2133
01:50:51,136 --> 01:50:56,512
And I imagine putting that much s*** in your body

2134
01:50:57,280 --> 01:50:59,072
It's a lot of pills that's a lot of pills

2135
01:50:59,328 --> 01:50:59,840
Yeah

2136
01:51:00,096 --> 01:51:06,240
It's also none of the numbers match up and I don't know what's going on at their marketing in orders

2137
01:51:06,496 --> 01:51:09,824
Problematic I think it might be too late for that

2138
01:51:10,080 --> 01:51:10,592
Now could be

2139
01:51:11,104 --> 01:51:13,664

It's one of the fake one

2170
01:52:49,152 --> 01:52:51,456
How long can the media get caught staging

2171
01:52:54,016 --> 01:52:54,528
As we let them

2172
01:52:55,808 --> 01:52:56,320

Mad at both of these guys

2176
01:53:13,728 --> 01:53:18,592
I'm really mad but I like that Alex doesn't even recognize

2177
01:53:18,848 --> 01:53:20,640
Attributing it to a different day

2178
01:53:20,896 --> 01:53:21,408

Facts about how there's nobody

Things and still getting MRIS

2184
01:53:34,208 --> 01:53:34,976
I

2185
01:53:35,488 --> 01:53:37,024
Only I'm going to play this clip

2186
01:53:37,280 --> 01:53:41,632
Because there's a really important that I need to make about it care about a lot of this content

2187
01:53:41,888 --> 01:53:43,424
But there's something that he's doing it

2188
01:53:43,680 --> 01:53:44,192
This clip that is a

2189
01:53:44,448 --> 01:53:44,960
The big problem

2190
01:53:46,240 --> 01:53:46,752
Phone call

2191
01:53:49,056 --> 01:53:51,360
Where is tsuyu you play more hospitals doing that

2192
01:54:00,576 --> 01:54:01,856
Tia

2193
01:54:09,792 --> 01:54:10,304
Sandy Hook

2194
01:54:10,816 --> 01:54:14,656
The walking around in circles the media lining up cars

2195
01:54:15,168 --> 01:54:17,472
Just him taking his Sandy Hook talking

2196
01:54:17,728 --> 01:54:19,520
And reapplying at the hospital.

2197
01:54:19,776 --> 01:54:20,544
Coronavirus

2198
01:54:21,056 --> 01:54:21,824
He needs to be

2199
01:54:22,080 --> 01:54:22,848
Bucking careful

2200
01:54:23,360 --> 01:54:24,384
He's doing it again

2201
01:54:24,640 --> 01:54:26,176
He's in the middle of this doing it again

2202
01:54:26,944 --> 01:54:27,712
Tragedy

2203
01:54:27,968 --> 01:54:29,248
You just can't resist

2204
01:54:29,504 --> 01:54:31,296
Being drawn to denying tragedy

2205
01:54:31,808 --> 01:54:36,416
So it's it's all he knows how to do to make money so their people who are walking

2206
01:54:36,672 --> 01:54:37,184
In and out

2207
01:54:37,696 --> 01:54:38,720
Performative

2208
01:54:38,976 --> 01:54:41,024
For the media to

2209
01:54:41,280 --> 01:54:41,792
So

2210
01:54:42,048 --> 01:54:43,328
So they would be so when you're

2211
01:54:43,584 --> 01:54:45,120
Performatively doing something

2212
01:54:45,376 --> 01:54:46,400
Unnecessary

2213
01:54:51,008 --> 01:54:51,776
30 black actor

2214
01:54:52,288 --> 01:54:56,640
Is what they they would be doing I think if I understand this correctly this has to do with

2215
01:54:58,944 --> 01:55:00,480
Came out of

2216
01:55:00,736 --> 01:55:04,064
Someone doing a remote shot and beating an establishing shot

2217
01:55:04,320 --> 01:55:05,088
So like

2218
01:55:05,344 --> 01:55:07,648
People to stand

2219
01:55:07,904 --> 01:55:10,464
News report would have b-roll

2220
01:55:10,720 --> 01:55:11,232
Or whatever

2221
01:55:12,768 --> 01:55:15,840
Yeah alright that's cheating or something

2222
01:55:16,352 --> 01:55:17,632
It's not it's not the

2223
01:55:17,888 --> 01:55:18,656
Dead to rights

2224
01:55:18,912 --> 01:55:19,936
Proof that Alex's

2225
01:55:20,192 --> 01:55:23,520
Sending a video of Alex

2226
01:55:23,776 --> 01:55:24,544
Things like that

2227
01:55:25,056 --> 01:55:26,080
It's not

2228
01:55:26,592 --> 01:55:27,616
PB news.

2229
01:55:28,640 --> 01:55:29,920
It's not dishonest

2230
01:55:30,432 --> 01:55:31,456
Tulsa

2231
01:55:31,968 --> 01:55:32,992
Strictly Auto

2232
01:55:33,248 --> 01:55:39,392
Whatever reality TV show

2233
01:55:39,648 --> 01:55:41,696
Is reality TV star

2234
01:55:41,952 --> 01:55:48,096
They were given to them by a writer Dan can you imagine that

2235
01:55:48,352 --> 01:55:48,864
Hellboy

2236
01:55:49,120 --> 01:55:51,680
So earlier in the show

2237
01:55:51,936 --> 01:55:55,008
He speculated pink sweater

2238
01:55:55,264 --> 01:55:56,288
To Bill Gate he did it

2239
01:55:56,544 --> 01:55:58,080
Alex accidentally asks

2240
01:55:58,336 --> 01:56:00,640
A follow-up

2241
01:56:01,152 --> 01:56:06,016
Zuckerberg

2242
01:56:08,576 --> 01:56:10,624
In the last London real

2243
01:56:11,136 --> 01:56:13,440
Bill Gates little non-threatening pig sweater

2244
01:56:19,328 --> 01:56:20,608
Contact David Icke

2245
01:56:20,864 --> 01:56:22,144
Six-letter sometimes

2246
01:56:22,400 --> 01:56:24,448
That's fine. What Ike

2247
01:56:24,704 --> 01:56:27,008
I know he doesn't need to because I don't think

2248
01:56:27,264 --> 01:56:32,384
I don't think he understands without weird masculinity

2249
01:56:32,640 --> 01:56:34,176
Doesn't care that much about that

2250
01:56:35,968 --> 01:56:37,504
Pictures of David Icke over the years work

2251
01:56:37,760 --> 01:56:40,832
Sweaters wardrobe

2252
01:56:41,088 --> 01:56:41,856
Thanks a nice color

2253
01:56:45,696 --> 01:56:46,208
So Jordan

2254
01:56:46,976 --> 01:56:48,256
A that we have

2255
01:56:49,024 --> 01:56:54,656
We know the David Icke has been coming on out to show and saying that there is no virus completely

2256
01:56:55,168 --> 01:56:58,240
Alex keeps allowing him to come on the show and dozen

2257
01:56:58,496 --> 01:57:01,312
Really fight with him about that

2258
01:57:01,568 --> 01:57:07,712
Pretty based on everything Alex says he knows that there is

2259
01:57:08,736 --> 01:57:09,504
Unfortunately

2260
01:57:09,760 --> 01:57:12,576
Every single time David Icke is on he swings out

2261
01:57:12,832 --> 01:57:16,416
Alex

2262
01:57:17,696 --> 01:57:18,720
Alex

2263
01:57:19,488 --> 01:57:20,000
This is so cool

2264
01:57:20,256 --> 01:57:20,768
Stupid

2265
01:57:34,848 --> 01:57:38,176
Never acted before

2266
01:57:38,688 --> 01:57:40,480
You're right it's just completely made up

2267
01:57:41,760 --> 01:57:43,808
Eva

2268
01:57:44,320 --> 01:57:48,160
I didn't even need to come to that conclusion Alex doesn't

2269
01:57:48,672 --> 01:57:54,816
So I guess when Alex is like eventually

2270
01:57:59,168 --> 01:58:00,192
That's what you think

2271
01:58:00,448 --> 01:58:01,472
That is

2272
01:58:02,752 --> 01:58:03,520
That's wild

2273
01:58:05,056 --> 01:58:06,848
Agreeing with you can't do that

2274
01:58:07,616 --> 01:58:09,920
Can't you just had it should be

2275
01:58:10,432 --> 01:58:13,504
Like that should be part of every human being

2276
01:58:14,528 --> 01:58:15,296
I can't do that

2277
01:58:15,808 --> 01:58:16,832
Yeah do that thing

2278
01:58:17,344 --> 01:58:19,648
Thing that I was going to do what I said

2279
01:58:19,904 --> 01:58:23,744
Everything that I believed was false and I agree with you and then later

2280
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:25,792
Five minutes later I'm going to

2281
01:58:26,048 --> 01:58:27,328
Completely forgot that I

2282
01:58:27,584 --> 01:58:33,472
Rocket defensive about it probably think that I said that

2283
01:58:33,728 --> 01:58:37,568
Things that I think I said that I know I didn't say I think I said

2284
01:58:38,848 --> 01:58:42,944
Wild walkthrough

2285
01:58:44,736 --> 01:58:46,528
I believe we have reached the end

2286
01:58:46,784 --> 01:58:50,624
Next episode on Friday

2287
01:58:50,880 --> 01:58:52,416
Check back on the rest of the week so you about

01:58:53,184 --> 01:58:54,976
Falls apart completely a disowns

It show

2290
01:58:58,560 --> 01:59:01,888
I really like to hear particular about how his life is a failure

2291
01:59:02,144 --> 01:59:07,520
I'm hoping for a real Coach mcguirk style like a off all of his clothes and just goes into the forest

2292
01:59:07,776 --> 01:59:13,920
Leave the guns behind braces the blade episode

2293
01:59:14,432 --> 01:59:15,968
That sounds great

2294
01:59:16,480 --> 01:59:17,760
We'll see what happens with this

2295
01:59:18,016 --> 01:59:20,576
Protracted meltdown

2296
01:59:20,832 --> 01:59:21,600
Never end so

2297
01:59:24,928 --> 01:59:27,744
Can't wait

2298
01:59:31,584 --> 01:59:37,728
We also on Twitter

01:59:37,984 --> 01:59:44,128
But if you'd like

2300
01:59:44,384 --> 01:59:44,896
It would very much

2301
01:59:45,152 --> 01:59:51,296
EBenefits

2302
01:59:51,552 --> 01:59:52,064
Herberg

2303
01:59:56,416 --> 01:59:56,928
Alex

2304
01:59:57,440 --> 01:59:57,952
In color

2305
01:59:58,208 --> 01:59:59,232
I love your work
