Black shirt

00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:35,648
I don't want

44
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:43,840
Thank you so much. Thank you very much.

45
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:54,848
What we have in front of us is a situation where

46
00:02:55,104 --> 00:02:57,152
To go over

47
00:02:57,664 --> 00:02:59,968
We have November 2nd

48
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:01,760
2018 to go over

49
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:05,600
And today

50
00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:11,488
And no one enjoys a present-day episode

51
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:17,888
Deeply truncated episode if this is an episode where we decide hey Alex is really afraid of white

52
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:19,936
And then cut all those

53
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:26,848
You've heard it all before we don't need to play for clips of him saying that Alex Jones

54
00:03:27,104 --> 00:03:28,896
Worried white people are going to do well

55
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:35,552
The normal

56
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:37,856
Sort of stuff that he gets into

57
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:38,880
Couple of

58
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:40,416
Stupid narratives

59
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:41,952
There's no

60
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:45,792
This episode is just really bad on a water level

61
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:46,816
And I don't want to

62
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:48,608
Talk about it so much

63
00:03:48,864 --> 00:03:52,192
It's so much that we've already gone over 100 times

64
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:56,800
And I don't want to waste our listeners time I don't want to waste my time while I'm not feeling great

65
00:03:57,056 --> 00:03:58,848
So I just want to cut through all the bulshit

66
00:03:59,104 --> 00:04:00,128
And just play you

67
00:04:00,384 --> 00:04:01,920
A couple of really important

68
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:03,712
Because they are very important

69
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:06,272
Some a couple of things that he says on the show

70
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:07,296
Are are

71
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:08,064
Dammit

72
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:11,136
And some of its kind of

73
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:16,768
The first cup I'm going to play for you here is Alex

74
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:18,303
Talking about

75
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:19,839
Trump's recent comments

76
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:21,375
About how

77
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:22,399
If you throw rocks

78
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:29,055
We might shoot you at the border that Alex would not be in favor of that

79
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:30,847
It's probably a little Overkill

80
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:49,023
Military

81
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:51,327
U.s. kill more cops

82
00:04:56,191 --> 00:05:00,543
Commercial video

83
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:02,079
Christman

84
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:06,943
You will be treated as military

85
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:19,487
If world

86
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:23,583
In front of you while you do it

87
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:24,863
You little dirtbag

88
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:29,471
We're putting you on notice

89
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:30,751
Call Deshawn

90
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:32,031
Across

91
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:33,055
The bow

92
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:36,895
The first one's free

93
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:44,575
Control

94
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:56,351
Know that

95
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:06,591
Isn't this a message to Iran

96
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:07,615
Stripper meme

97
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:18,367
That you have pushed so far you people are so crazy

98
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:20,415
Actions are coming

99
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:24,255
November 6th

100
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:26,303
Get ready

101
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:27,583
Sanctioned

102
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:33,215
Before the election debates in 2016

103
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:39,615
Trump was throwing you in prison Hillary Clinton

104
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:40,895
Cendere we are you

105
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:43,967
There's so many of these things

106
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:49,343
Carrots

107
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:53,183
If we win the midterm

108
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:54,463
It's so pathetic

109
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:58,303
And then heading into that this idea that you like yeah yeah

110
00:06:58,559 --> 00:06:59,583
You throw a rock

111
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:04,959
We're going to shoot you and that is what should happen we've learned about this Palace

112
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:08,031
But years ago not that long ago

113
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:10,847
Alex was

114
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:14,687
Just use that as an example of like

115
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:18,527
Yes absolutely it's a great idea to shoot people who throw rocks

116
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:19,551
Is deep

117
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:21,087
Deeply troubling

118
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:25,695
He could throw his support behind

119
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:28,511
The US Military

120
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:29,791
Murdering

121
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:31,327
Thousands of people

122
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:39,775
There's a lot of guys wearing

123
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:42,847
Full body armor with semi-automatic rifles

124
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:45,919
As well as other battle accoutrement

125
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:48,991
Sure the other side there are

126
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:54,623
Women and children escaping Honduras under threat

127
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:59,743
Places where they don't have all of those things

128
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:03,327
And they're bringing their kids to just survive

129
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:07,423
On one side you got those guys those are cute

130
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:11,007
The big rocks

131
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:12,287
Yeah this is awful

132
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:18,175
And this is one of the reasons why this show sucks so much

133
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:19,199
In the present

134
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:22,015
Because we know enough about Alex to know like

135
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:23,039
Hey man

136
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:25,343
You have gone like you have gone

137
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:31,743
So far away from what you stood for

138
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:33,279
You should know

139
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:35,839
Go back to where you were nothing like that

140
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:39,423
Not great.

141
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:40,191
Awful

142
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:41,727
To look at this interview like

143
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:43,519
You lost it

144
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:45,823
You never had it but you lost

145
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:48,127
You still lost it and never had it

146
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:51,711
Mainstream thought

147
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:56,575
We need the military On the Border

148
00:08:57,343 --> 00:08:59,135
What else is a military for

149
00:08:59,391 --> 00:09:00,927
I don't know anymore either

150
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:02,207
No principles

151
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:03,487
It doesn't even matter

152
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:05,279
F****** so stupid

153
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:07,839
So if Alex wants

154
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:08,607
Be afraid

155
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:09,887
Caravan

156
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:10,911
Coming up here

157
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:12,191
I want to change

158
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:12,959
Change America

159
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:13,727
Into another

160
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:20,639
Used up by the system used by

161
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:22,687
Underclass for the laps you want slaves

162
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:30,367
And they're coming here in Flagstaff

163
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:42,143
Anyways

164
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:44,191
T-shirt

165
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:45,983
These days

166
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:49,823
Hurt more cuz they're just like

167
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:50,847
You are

168
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:55,199
He's spending all of his time talking about

169
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:59,807
There's a hundred thousand two hundred thousand people

170
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:03,903
All slamming into the border is an invasion Force

171
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:07,487
Venezuela also we have

172
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:11,071
Terrifying

173
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:12,863
Why why

174
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:13,887
Why

175
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:14,911
Why

176
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:15,935
Would you

177
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:17,215
That

178
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:18,751
A group of people

179
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:19,775
Spleen

180
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:21,055
Asylum

181
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:27,455
But their own country

182
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:30,271
Would want to then bring that style of government here

183
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:34,623
Does he not know why people are coming

184
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:36,159
I mean he he thinks he

185
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:37,183
You knows it but it's

186
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:37,951
It's not

187
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:39,743
Is that the people that are coming

188
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:40,511
Weather going to change

189
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:41,279
Country

190
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:43,583
The people on the ground

191
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:45,631
You are forcing the chaos in order for the

192
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:46,655
Global

193
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:47,935
Globalist

194
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:51,007
Combines in order they are going to change it into Venezuela

195
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:58,175
That's more

196
00:10:58,431 --> 00:11:00,223
That makes perfect

197
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:02,271
Ludacris

198
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:04,063
Equip Alex's f******

199
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:04,831
Fired up

200
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:05,599
On this episode

201
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:08,159
He's going Full Tilt Boogie

202
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:09,695
If you will allow the

203
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:10,463
U-turn phrase

204
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:13,023
Explain

205
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:14,047
Why he's fired

206
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:25,567
Literally globalist

207
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:44,767
Movies

208
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:46,303
What was

209
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:57,055
Indeed.com

210
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:06,783
Call me by your name about

211
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:09,087
Man old man

212
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:09,855
That

213
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:12,671
Sad I think the nun was actually about Raceway

214
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:16,255
Did you did you notice

215
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:24,959
Groceries really not immediately after saying

216
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:26,751
This is not red

217
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:33,919
Otherwise you're like

218
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:36,223
We have to go kill the other guys

219
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:37,503
Weather

220
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:39,039
There's a problem

221
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:45,439
Went further being like this isn't rhetoric and then using it very clear rhetorical technique where you at listen to

222
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:49,279
Emotional response out of your audience

223
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:52,351
That's rhetoric to a T

224
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:54,143
That's exactly what he's doing

225
00:12:56,703 --> 00:13:00,031
I'm going to use this rhetoric in order to Prime

226
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:01,311
But it's not a rapper

227
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:05,919
I'm going to ask myself a question and then you will listen rhetorically

228
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:10,271
This makes poop is really the reason why

229
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:14,111
Even though I realize that most of the stuff isn't worth going over

230
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:15,391
Like

231
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:19,487
Elvis episode he's complaining about Michael Moore

232
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:21,023
Be eliminated

233
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:24,351
He's just talkin about a staff Myers interview where he doesn't say that

234
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:29,727
He's talking about Oprah Winfrey talking about how all old white people need to die out

235
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:30,751
He plays an interview from

236
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:32,031
2013

237
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:34,847
Where she doesn't even say that she just

238
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:39,967
The people she's asked the question of whether or not the problem of racism has been solved

239
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:41,247
Jesus going today

240
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:44,831
No absolutely not you know we have a whole lot of people

241
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:45,855
Have been soaked

242
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:48,159
Did marinated in the cultures racism

243
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:49,439
Prejudice

244
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:50,207
Need to die

245
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:51,743
They need to die out

246
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:55,071
Jinsei white people at all

247
00:13:56,863 --> 00:13:58,911
That they always reveal exactly what it is

248
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:06,079
There's a lot of stuff like that

249
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:10,431
Don't I don't care

250
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:12,479
Just don't care

251
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:14,527
But this I care about very much

252
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:15,807
This makes clip

253
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:17,343
Is

254
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:19,135
Problem

255
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:30,399
Lawsuits against

256
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:38,591
You got to let them come

257
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:51,135
Understood

258
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:01,631
Benin flood up with million

259
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:10,079
Call

260
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:19,295
The UN and the globalist

261
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:22,623
He just said

262
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:23,391
Trump

263
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:25,695
Has initiated rex-84

264
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:26,975
Now

265
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:27,743
This

266
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:29,023
Is perhaps

267
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:30,047
The most

268
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:32,351
F*****-up thing I've ever heard come out of his mouth

269
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:35,935
Alex

270
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:42,335
Something that is recently is 2016 screaming about it being part of the globalist

271
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:44,639
Here are some headlines

272
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:48,735
2009 RAV4

273
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:52,319
U.s. Constitution

274
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:53,599
The article is about out

275
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:54,879
Because of wrecks

276
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:56,159
It 2012

277
00:15:56,415 --> 00:16:00,255
FEMA camp rendition hubs discovered article mostly before

278
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:03,583
His entire career

279
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:06,655
Alex Jones made it a Cornerstone of his rhetoric that the big

280
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:09,471
Threat that he was standing up against was government tyranny

281
00:16:09,983 --> 00:16:11,263
They presented itself in the form of

282
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:12,031
FEMA camps

283
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:15,615
Used to set up

284
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:19,199
He spent countless hours detailing his perverse fantasies

285
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:23,295
Of fighting off the Imagine

286
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:27,135
And what are the big pieces that he always

287
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:27,903
This wasn't just

288
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:28,671
Sup

289
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:31,999
In baking the stuff up with the existence of rex-84

290
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:36,607
It is real therefore what I'm saying isn't bulshit was basically his argument

291
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:39,935
Rex 84 was the plan that Ollie North came up with

292
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:41,727
There was a

293
00:16:41,983 --> 00:16:43,519
The Detention of communist and leftist

294
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:46,335
Let nothing to do with Alex

295
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:50,687
But because it's sort of thematic Leaf it with his stupid FEMA camp narrative

296
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:55,039
He and Larry Nichols in particular would use it to drum up fear in his audience at this was coming

297
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:56,575
He were days away

298
00:16:56,831 --> 00:16:57,855
But I'm coming for you

299
00:16:58,111 --> 00:16:58,879
I find it pretty

300
00:16:59,135 --> 00:17:00,415
Piccalilli pathetic and stick

301
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:02,463
Good thing

302
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:05,023
For Trump to use rex-84 to deal with these Refuge

303
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:10,143
Career out of arguing the rex-84 is the literal blueprints

304
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:12,703
We used to bring in martial law in this country

305
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:15,519
And the fact that you celebrating the idea of using such a

306
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:18,079
Here is very clear indication

307
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:19,103
Northeast

308
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:20,127
Is very cold

309
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:22,687
Alex Jones does not care about tyranny

310
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:26,527
He was really really doesn't want that tyranny to be targeted towards wife

311
00:17:29,343 --> 00:17:32,415
If a black man is in office

312
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:34,463
Cuz he might

313
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:39,327
Then

314
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:42,399
And here's the bigger

315
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:43,167
Richard Jordan

316
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:45,471
In his entire career

317
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:49,823
Did the tyrannies at that he's afraid of

318
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:52,895
The implementation.

319
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:56,223
You playing very unpopular that people wouldn't be into it

320
00:17:56,735 --> 00:18:02,879
In order for something like rex-84 to be implemented his imaginary bad guys would need to create a false flag

321
00:18:03,135 --> 00:18:04,415
Pretext in order to implement

322
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:06,207
These villains

323
00:18:06,463 --> 00:18:09,535
Have a manufactured crisis in order to bring a plant

324
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:14,143
What do we see in front of us right now

325
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:20,543
It was a

326
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:24,127
Caravan that came along every year is almost like a symbolic Act

327
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:31,807
Just blatantly lie about this immigrant

328
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:32,575
Event coming up

329
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:37,695
The American Border

330
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:38,975
To stand there in

331
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:42,047
Situation

332
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:44,095
Where Donald Trump

333
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:45,375
Essentially said

334
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:46,911
PewDiePie if you got them

335
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:47,935
That whole thing

336
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:48,959
Are you staying

337
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:49,983
Are you staying

338
00:18:53,055 --> 00:18:59,199
Qualify as this crisis

339
00:18:59,455 --> 00:18:59,967
Interesting

340
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:04,575
I mean Alex over inflates the number of people in the Caravan of hundreds of thousands

341
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:06,111
Has a strong Army

342
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:10,463
The right-wing media refers to visit in as an invasion in the f****** stupid president

343
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:13,023
People throw stones

344
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:18,399
An article in the Washington Post today was putting a number of people in the group at approximately 4,000

345
00:19:18,911 --> 00:19:21,983
Which is right in line with stories that have been coming out about the numbers dropping

346
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:22,751
Past week

347
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:27,359
They were passing through Veracruz 626 miles

348
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:28,639
From the closest border crossing

349
00:19:28,895 --> 00:19:31,967
Approximately 204 more hours of walking

350
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:33,503
You didn't take any break

351
00:19:34,015 --> 00:19:37,087
This isn't something it's that to culminate on Election Day is Alex

352
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:39,135
Clams are

353
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:44,511
And most importantly nothing that these people are doing or plan to do is illegal according to US law

354
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:50,143
They're refugees fleeing violence in Central America native every right to make it to the border and plead for Asylum

355
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:54,751
Whether or not they get it is an administrative matter but they're entirely within their rights

356
00:19:55,263 --> 00:19:58,335
You're totally right this entire pageant play out is it

357
00:19:58,591 --> 00:20:01,407
Concerted effort by the right-wing media to manufacture a crisis

358
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:05,247
And we've seen the mainstream media be woefully incompetent in their reporting

359
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:08,319
And it doesn't solve

360
00:20:09,855 --> 00:20:15,999
You could make the argument that most of the right-wing is jumping on board with this traffic in this false reality

361
00:20:16,511 --> 00:20:18,815
Because they know that without something

362
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:20,863
A lot of them

363
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:22,143
But that

364
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:23,679
Can't work for Alex Jones

365
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:25,471
Based on his career

366
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:26,239
He knows

367
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:32,127
All Alex does is warranted a shadowy group of Bad actors are coming to manufacture a crisis in order to put

368
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:35,967
An unpopular and probably illegal plan people in camps

369
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:37,503
In place

370
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:40,063
And the process will use the military as a way

371
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:42,623
Breeches Papi, Tata

372
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:46,463
2018 is an active participant manufacturing crisis

373
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:48,511
It's being used to push through on

374
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:51,583
Probably illegal plans at least people

375
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:54,143
Which involves using the military to breathe

376
00:20:55,423 --> 00:20:57,983
He is exactly what he has warned everyone about

377
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:01,055
Pathetic

378
00:21:05,407 --> 00:21:06,431
I mean if it

379
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:08,991
If it were like a

380
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:10,527
Andy Kaufman

381
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:11,295
Sketches

382
00:21:11,551 --> 00:21:12,063
Brillion

383
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:14,879
Well it's a tragedy

384
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:16,416
20 years

385
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:21,792
Building up this anti-establishment character only

386
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:22,816
Turn heel

387
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:24,608
At the opportune moment

388
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,400
Set 80 Kaufman all over

389
00:21:29,472 --> 00:21:32,032
Uno's

390
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:37,664
One of the reasons why I feel like

391
00:21:39,456 --> 00:21:40,736
I'm in I'm out of sorts

392
00:21:40,992 --> 00:21:41,760
I have no words

393
00:21:42,784 --> 00:21:45,856
I am deeply disgusted by this sort of

394
00:21:46,112 --> 00:21:46,880
This sort of thing

395
00:21:47,392 --> 00:21:48,672
I felt like

396
00:21:49,696 --> 00:21:52,768
Every time we've seen him be like

397
00:21:53,024 --> 00:21:55,584
You know earlier couple of months ago or so

398
00:21:56,096 --> 00:21:58,400
We checked in on him and he was saying that it's great

399
00:21:58,656 --> 00:22:00,448
The Trump is going to send the military to the Border

400
00:22:02,496 --> 00:22:04,544
This is real

401
00:22:05,056 --> 00:22:06,592
I thought that was

402
00:22:06,848 --> 00:22:09,920
Surprising I'm disappointed in you

403
00:22:10,432 --> 00:22:11,456
But I didn't

404
00:22:11,712 --> 00:22:13,248
Get the FEMA camp stuff

405
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:14,528
Was negotiable

406
00:22:14,784 --> 00:22:16,576
For him like you know what I'm saying

407
00:22:16,832 --> 00:22:17,344
He's made

408
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,392
Multiple documentaries

409
00:22:19,648 --> 00:22:21,184
The building up of the fear of

410
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,744
This exact thing now advocating

411
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:25,280
Just nothing

412
00:22:26,048 --> 00:22:28,096
Everything you believed in a gun

413
00:22:28,352 --> 00:22:28,864
Stop it

414
00:22:29,888 --> 00:22:31,168
We have to quit.

415
00:22:32,192 --> 00:22:34,240
Conclusion I don't know

416
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:36,544
In this like long tragic

417
00:22:40,896 --> 00:22:43,456
Kind of tale of rising

418
00:22:44,992 --> 00:22:45,760
Meaninglessness

419
00:22:48,832 --> 00:22:50,624
They were all global

420
00:22:53,696 --> 00:22:57,024
Completely

421
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:01,376
Every single one of his like this is the last one

422
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:03,424
Of him actually advocating

423
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:09,056
For the very thing that he has been

424
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,360
He's he's now

425
00:23:12,896 --> 00:23:13,664
OSHA

426
00:23:14,176 --> 00:23:15,456
That's actually good

427
00:23:16,736 --> 00:23:17,504
Let's do that one

428
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:23,904
In the reason he's able to do is your dad even in

429
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:25,184
The Liberals

430
00:23:26,464 --> 00:23:30,560
Retcon stuff

431
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:33,120
But that is been very present

432
00:23:33,376 --> 00:23:36,448
Like even just a year or two ago that was his line

433
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:37,984
2D ID

434
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,800
I'm trying to rewrite this idea

435
00:23:41,312 --> 00:23:42,592
It means you have to rewrite

436
00:23:43,104 --> 00:23:45,152
That everything is up for grabs

437
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:46,432
Nothing he believes

438
00:23:46,944 --> 00:23:47,968
Or or

439
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,248
I mean he could just be like

440
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:54,112
DirecTV

441
00:23:54,624 --> 00:23:55,648
Everything is gone

442
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,488
He wants to kill the Younglings too

443
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,816
66

444
00:24:05,632 --> 00:24:06,144
Come on man

445
00:24:07,168 --> 00:24:08,960
I guess what I wanted to hear is

446
00:24:09,984 --> 00:24:11,520
Michaux

447
00:24:11,776 --> 00:24:12,544
Is predictable

448
00:24:14,336 --> 00:24:15,616
Present-day episode

449
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:16,384
Is very pretty

450
00:24:18,432 --> 00:24:20,480
Stupid fear-mongering about the Refuge

451
00:24:20,736 --> 00:24:21,248
Fuji cameras

452
00:24:22,016 --> 00:24:23,296
Stupid

453
00:24:23,552 --> 00:24:24,064
Stupid

454
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,600
White genocide

455
00:24:26,624 --> 00:24:28,416
That stuff is all like yes

456
00:24:28,928 --> 00:24:29,440
Seeing all this

457
00:24:30,464 --> 00:24:32,256
But the idea that he's advocating

458
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:34,048
4

459
00:24:34,304 --> 00:24:34,816
Literally

460
00:24:35,328 --> 00:24:37,888
Trump is putting in place Rex 84

461
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,936
It just means to be like

462
00:24:40,448 --> 00:24:41,216
It's not interesting

463
00:24:42,752 --> 00:24:46,080
I do I don't know if that makes sense but it's not interesting to me because

464
00:24:46,336 --> 00:24:47,872
What interest me is true

465
00:24:48,384 --> 00:24:49,408
When we

466
00:24:49,664 --> 00:24:52,224
Shows that I can in the pack

467
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,760
It's it's interesting to me

468
00:24:54,016 --> 00:24:55,808
To hear him lie of whole bunch

469
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,088
MN learn

470
00:24:57,344 --> 00:24:57,856
About

471
00:24:58,112 --> 00:24:58,880
XYZ

472
00:24:59,904 --> 00:25:00,928
I understand that there's a

473
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,720
Probably an interesting

474
00:25:02,976 --> 00:25:04,768
Human story here with a man

475
00:25:05,024 --> 00:25:06,816
Who's gone so far

476
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:08,608
Down a terrible path

477
00:25:08,864 --> 00:25:11,936
But he's advocating for the very thing you made six documentaries

478
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:15,264
But it's not really interesting

479
00:25:17,568 --> 00:25:23,712
Yeah yeah

480
00:25:24,224 --> 00:25:25,760
Expected

481
00:25:26,016 --> 00:25:32,160
Think you would be that Brazen we don't generally make predict

482
00:25:32,416 --> 00:25:33,952
Cuz we did this

483
00:25:34,976 --> 00:25:35,488
Back

484
00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:39,328
Second

485
00:25:39,584 --> 00:25:44,192
84

486
00:25:44,704 --> 00:25:48,032
It's parody it sees a parody of himself

487
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:50,848
You know what else to say

488
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,920
Fascinator

489
00:25:54,176 --> 00:25:58,016
F*** you don't have to

490
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:02,112
We've gone through all of these different

491
00:26:02,368 --> 00:26:06,464
. and Alex Jones Is Life

492
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:09,536
Never even even when we saw him jump on Trump

493
00:26:10,048 --> 00:26:12,096
I never would have expected him to have

494
00:26:12,352 --> 00:26:14,144
Literally denied all of his

495
00:26:14,912 --> 00:26:16,448
Principles

496
00:26:17,728 --> 00:26:18,240
Thumbs up

497
00:26:18,496 --> 00:26:20,544
I think that's because that's one of the most

498
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:21,312
Important things

499
00:26:21,568 --> 00:26:22,848
Edsby

500
00:26:23,104 --> 00:26:24,640
Protection of white

501
00:26:25,408 --> 00:26:25,920
That sort of thing

502
00:26:26,176 --> 00:26:26,944
I didn't get that

503
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:27,968
The biggest

504
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:29,248
It's non-negotiable

505
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:35,648
Like we're never going to see that change

506
00:26:35,904 --> 00:26:42,048
He's never going to come out like in favor of multiculturalism

507
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:43,328
Of that one

508
00:26:48,448 --> 00:26:52,544
I think the bigger issue is that what I mean you've already served a touchdown

509
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,080
It is not

510
00:26:55,616 --> 00:26:56,640
Presenting himself as

511
00:26:57,152 --> 00:26:58,944
I'm very passionate about and caring about

512
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,224
He didn't really care about

513
00:27:02,528 --> 00:27:03,296
Is on

514
00:27:03,552 --> 00:27:04,832
Doing his wife's work

515
00:27:05,088 --> 00:27:08,672
In recontextualizing it in some sort of weird way

516
00:27:09,184 --> 00:27:09,696
Like

517
00:27:09,952 --> 00:27:11,232
If you'd studied RX8

518
00:27:11,488 --> 00:27:15,072
Before and realize that it was all the liberal plot or whatever

519
00:27:15,328 --> 00:27:16,352
When did that happen

520
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:19,168
When did it start

521
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:22,240
Send in decided to start eating like out

522
00:27:23,264 --> 00:27:25,568
What did you study tell you that

523
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:26,592
I don't know what to do

524
00:27:26,848 --> 00:27:27,616
Future goals for Alex

525
00:27:27,872 --> 00:27:28,640
This looks grim

526
00:27:33,248 --> 00:27:35,808
I hate to feel bad for him

527
00:27:36,064 --> 00:27:36,832
But I just

528
00:27:38,112 --> 00:27:40,928
I don't know you know it's like it's like you have an enemy

529
00:27:41,184 --> 00:27:41,696
You hate them

530
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:43,232
10 years

531
00:27:43,744 --> 00:27:44,768
Go back to

532
00:27:45,024 --> 00:27:46,304
Your hometown you find them

533
00:27:46,816 --> 00:27:50,912
Drunk at noon at the bar

534
00:27:51,168 --> 00:27:57,312
Hey it's hard to hate you and I'll come on man I got to go

535
00:27:57,568 --> 00:28:00,384
Whatever it was you lost

536
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:06,784
Whatever it is I got to go

537
00:28:09,856 --> 00:28:12,160
Like in Grosse Pointe Blank whenever

538
00:28:12,416 --> 00:28:16,256
John Cusack meets up with a volley from his high school

539
00:28:17,536 --> 00:28:18,048
Amazing

540
00:28:22,656 --> 00:28:24,448
Notebook.com

541
00:28:24,704 --> 00:28:27,264
We also have a present

542
00:28:33,152 --> 00:28:34,688
Barely on it

543
00:28:35,456 --> 00:28:39,552
Facebook

544
00:28:39,808 --> 00:28:45,184
What if you wanted to find us in a downloadable format where you're living with other podcast

545
00:28:45,696 --> 00:28:46,720
Something

546
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:50,304
I'm sorry I'm feeling under the weather

547
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:52,608
And I don't want to do a present day episode

548
00:28:52,864 --> 00:28:53,888
And that's all of the clips that I have

549
00:28:54,144 --> 00:29:00,288
I realize that would be marginally unsettling or unsatisfying

550
00:29:00,544 --> 00:29:03,616
Four people out there and I apologize

551
00:29:03,872 --> 00:29:06,176
Something that's a little bit more

552
00:29:06,432 --> 00:29:08,480
Good and hopefully

553
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:11,296
Midterms

554
00:29:13,344 --> 00:29:14,624
If you if you want to

555
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:15,392
Play Aisha

556
00:29:15,648 --> 00:29:16,928
Anyway

557
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:19,232
Listen

558
00:29:20,768 --> 00:29:23,072
Rex 84

559
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:24,608
It is now though

560
00:29:24,864 --> 00:29:27,424
Corndance

561
00:29:28,704 --> 00:29:31,008
As far as I know that plan is never killed

562
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,080
Although one guy

563
00:29:34,592 --> 00:29:35,104
Technically

564
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:35,872
Probably have

565
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:40,992
Holding

566
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:46,624
Alexandra Thurston color
