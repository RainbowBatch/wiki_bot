Just because you got to say it up top

4
00:00:32,768 --> 00:00:34,048
Turn off now but you won't get the rest

5
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:40,704
Because I got some stuff to play for you

6
00:00:45,824 --> 00:00:51,968

00:00:52,224 --> 00:00:52,992

The playground.

14
00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:17,312
Hell if I know this

15
00:01:17,824 --> 00:01:23,456
I'm still not entirely sure what episode of Alex Jones will be covering still up in the air

16
00:01:23,712 --> 00:01:28,832
To a certain degree

17
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:30,112
Dash fights

18
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:33,440
Set the alarm to get to go to the playground theater.com

19
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:34,720
Figure it out

20
00:01:34,976 --> 00:01:37,024

Four different types

26
00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:54,944
Regular

27
00:01:55,456 --> 00:01:56,480
One-third less calories

28
00:01:56,736 --> 00:01:57,760
2/3 less calories

29
00:01:58,528 --> 00:02:00,320
0 caliber

00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:03,904
Tons so much

31
00:02:07,488 --> 00:02:13,632
Not nearly that much not a Mystic level

32
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,472
Miss

33
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:18,496

Very different feel to that one line of his as I can't

37
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:41,024
Exactly but

38
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:46,656
Look it look it was shut up

The hell

41
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:55,616

00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:32,736
I don't this isn't about money

52
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:39,136
I just want to have one episode we're like 10 different people decide to become globalist

53
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:40,416
And we just play that

54
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:41,184
Forever

55
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:55,008
We're putting together

56
00:03:55,264 --> 00:03:59,616
We're well on our way toward making that goal

57
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:00,640
We are on Pace

58
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:07,040
To make the goal which will force us to start doing

59
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:18,559
If we join

60
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:20,351
February 1st we will begin

61
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:24,959
Breaking down Alex Jones

62
00:04:25,215 --> 00:04:25,727
And my sleep

63
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:29,823
Schedule

64
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:32,383
Young Thug

65
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:35,199
On the broadcast if you have the plug

66
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:36,991
Now is the time to start

67
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:42,879
Every mentioned on the last show

68
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:45,183
We got together this weekend

69
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:48,511
Try to compile a list of potential things to cover

70
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:52,351
For live show Saturday 10:30 p.m.

71
00:04:52,607 --> 00:04:53,119
Stingray

72
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:59,519
Write included on that list was the day ratzinger the old

73
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:01,567
Pope stepped out

74
00:05:01,823 --> 00:05:06,687
Amazing

75
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:12,319
And there was a guest host today I don't know if you knew this

76
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:13,855
Alex Jones is a card

77
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:23,071
The other another one was the Year in 2012 year

78
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:29,471
He might get weird about that about the calendar and end overages and shortages

79
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:31,519
We like to deal with absolutely

80
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:33,823
Leap years are globalist

81
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:39,711
Unfortunately I went back to that.

82
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:40,479
Ron Paul

83
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:42,271
Good still

84
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:45,087
Youth in Louisiana

85
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:45,855
Broadcast

86
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:52,255
From my hotel room it's terrible is an awful show

87
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:54,047
To these possibilities and they're just not

88
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:55,071
No good

89
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:57,119
But one of them stuck out in my mind

90
00:05:57,887 --> 00:06:00,191
There's like this is going to be a good one

91
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:04,031
And it turns out it is a good one

92
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:07,103
And that is

93
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:09,663
The day after LaVoy finicum

94
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:11,199
Got shot by the police

95
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:17,599
Ian that Oregon Oregon Wildlife Preserve

96
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:20,927
All right there by new Alex would be freaking out

97
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:22,207
Exact

98
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:23,231
Coincidence

99
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:27,327
Listening to old

100
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:28,095
I listened

101
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:29,887
That episode earlier today

102
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:36,287
I won't get into the actual speed

103
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:39,359
I wouldn't understand why we would have to deal with it

104
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:40,639
Slightly briefly

105
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:41,919
I just because they get

106
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:42,687
Super race

107
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:46,527
Sad about it but at the same time

108
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:49,087
Just about a 1/2 bunch of weird false

109
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:50,623
Military

110
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:53,695
Occupying a bird Reserve

111
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:59,327
Get racist is really fascinating and I'm excited to talk about it

112
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:00,607
Morphis

113
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:04,447
I don't know what's going on

114
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:08,031
But he says a couple of things in this episode

115
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:09,311
That are Beyond The Pale

116
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:11,359
I told you this before the show

117
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:12,895
Yeah I stand by it

118
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:15,199
You have to look at Alex Jones

119
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:16,479
Completely differently

120
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:21,599
After you hear a couple of things he says I'm an episode

121
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:23,647
Just some of the beliefs he has

122
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:25,695
Where they come from

123
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:27,231
And how stupid

124
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:31,071
So we will do that

125
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:35,423
Climate change is good well that's actually the episode

126
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:41,823
Nails today

127
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:44,895
The beginning of the episode Alex Jones talking about how

128
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:46,687
He doesn't want

129
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:47,967
Get hot

130
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:50,015
He doesn't want it to be a hot War

131
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:50,783
Red Dead

132
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:55,647
Not shooting

133
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:58,719
These people to preserve our amateurs

134
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:02,303
And

135
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:04,095
Did shouldn't get into a viola

136
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:05,119
War

137
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:06,655
Let's not do that

138
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:08,447
I'm glad you qualified it with

139
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:09,471
The now

140
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:14,079
Well that he's into that but also he ends up saying

141
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:17,663
About his mentality

142
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:19,199
His personal

143
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:23,295
Feeling about his place in the world this is this isn't weird stuff

144
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:24,575
To start out with

145
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:26,623
The Mormons are littoral birds

146
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:29,695
I got put the energy for 21 years

147
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:31,231
Of someone willing to die

148
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:34,815
Information

149
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:38,655
Bully

150
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:39,423
Put present

151
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:52,735
Martyr

152
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:57,087
If he says Martin Luther King jr.

153
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:08,607
But you have to

154
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:10,143
Build consciousness

155
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:13,983
Personality

156
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:15,775
Three months

157
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:18,847
Surprise

158
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:21,151
And make the sacrifice

159
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:23,455
When it's destroyed

160
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:30,111
As they try to assassinate my character as they try to kill my name

161
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:32,671
It's already a martyr level

162
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:36,255
Which humans admire

163
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:37,791
So

164
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:38,815
From the jump

165
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:39,839
We're getting

166
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:44,703
This idea first of all

167
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:51,103
Why don't you guys understand that for twenty years I've been building myself up as a

168
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:53,919
The Martyr that no one will ever murder

169
00:09:58,783 --> 00:10:01,855
I think that's kind of I mean it's indicative of

170
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:02,879
A real

171
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:03,903
Mental disorder

172
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:09,791
Narcissism in there a little

173
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:12,863
What do you say it isn't like his standard manic

174
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:15,167
Thing that he gets whenever he gets into

175
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:15,935
These are

176
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:17,471
Hyper

177
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:18,239
Statistic

178
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:21,823
Bloviating sessions but he gets into

179
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:24,895
Yeah it's a hundred percent a real thing he believe

180
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:26,687
I think especially

181
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:29,247
I think this is him

182
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:30,783
Externalizing a little bit of stuff

183
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:31,551
But he generally

184
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:32,319
Keeps inside

185
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:33,855
And one of them is that

186
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:35,391
Don't you guys understand

187
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:37,695
I'm going to be the hero

188
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:39,231
When they take me down

189
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:40,767
I will be the hero

190
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:43,583
He's creating a stage for himself

191
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:44,351
To be what

192
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:46,911
He sees himself to be in his own mind

193
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:47,935
That's fine

194
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:49,471
Cuz that's a variant

195
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:50,239
Interesting psychology

196
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:51,007
He wants

197
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:52,543
For the cause

198
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:54,591
Hold on now

199
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:55,871
He's making up retard

200
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:58,943
Right right right

201
00:10:59,199 --> 00:10:59,711
I will

202
00:11:02,527 --> 00:11:05,343
I'm going to make sure

203
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:08,159
So I look like a victim

204
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:11,999
Which definitely is in line with all of his at

205
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:13,791
The fees and what-have-you

206
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:16,863
This next clip Alex Jones

207
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:19,167
Gets into how you believe that

208
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:20,959
The Bundy group has been in

209
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:22,495
Will traded and there's feds

210
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:23,775
And s*** like that

211
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:26,079
Might be

212
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:27,871
The weird thing is I think he is right

213
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:34,271
Duwayne

214
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:35,039
He's like

215
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:37,087
It's crawling with FEDS

216
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:42,719
ARS also saying that people who are dressed up like Uncle Sam and all that

217
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:47,327
They were fed to make people look like assholes

218
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:48,351
Yeah

219
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:51,935
Sads

220
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:54,495
But the Cards Against Humanity

221
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:55,519
He did that in that

222
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:56,799
Giant

223
00:11:57,311 --> 00:11:59,359
No he's he's just a

224
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:02,943
The infiltrator

225
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:08,575
Middle to end of this clip that

226
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:09,855
Beagles like code

227
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:11,903
The bunnies are not them

228
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:12,671
Operatives

229
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:17,279
You can listen to him

230
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:18,559
They're good people

231
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:24,447
George Washington

232
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:27,519
They would have been the guy in the trench

233
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:31,103
They are not

234
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:32,639
Generals

235
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:34,175
Think about

236
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:41,599
You take one good look at him know where they come from they're good people that there was

237
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:45,183
Redfin

238
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:46,463
Kronos

239
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:49,279
Keep talkin about

240
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:55,679
He's calling himself the general without having to say it them

241
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:56,959
Ostensibly

242
00:12:57,215 --> 00:13:01,055
Being more active in the same goal

243
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:04,127
There

244
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:04,895
Whatever

245
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:08,991
Can you really disagree with him

246
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:10,271
Not fully

247
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:14,879
No he does have a generals

248
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:15,903
So now

249
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:16,671
At this point

250
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:19,743
This is where we start

251
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:22,303
No certainly not

252
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:23,583
No

253
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:27,935
Oh yeah that is true power

254
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:29,471
No you're not

255
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:32,543
It's pretty early in the episode

256
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:34,335
Alex Jones Pitt starts to

257
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:35,103
To take a pivot

258
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:38,175
Away from talking about the Bundys specifically

259
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:40,991
I'm starting to talk about his understanding

260
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:42,271
Of government

261
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:45,599
No not that

262
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:47,647
Is understanding of government

263
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:48,927
Is understanding

264
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:49,951
History

265
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:50,719
And this stuff

266
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:53,023
Buckin Wild Style

267
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:55,071
Here's the first one we talked about the intelligence

268
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:57,375
There's different facts

269
00:13:57,631 --> 00:14:00,959
7 factions we know of Anna CIA

270
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:03,007
Major factions

271
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:06,591
Different administrations come in and try to create new faction

272
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:10,175
CIA

273
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:12,735
There's Navy versus army that's a football game

274
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:18,623
Intelligent

275
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:19,647
Everybody

276
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:23,999
She's describing Department everybody's

277
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:29,887
There's a Big Mac

278
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:33,215
Trying to control manipulated International fax

279
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:39,615
Alamo

280
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:42,431
So that that's that's

281
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:44,223
Inspections

282
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:45,247
Department

283
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:48,831
Right and then he expands it without

284
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:53,183
Ready talked about International tax

285
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:56,767
The cia's also oversees who knows

286
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:04,703
Because I would say

287
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:09,055
For someone in Alex Jones's position

288
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:10,079
Specific about what he's talking

289
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:12,895
If there's 7 factions in the CIA

290
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:13,663
Come out with it

291
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:16,223
Possible

292
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:18,015
Look you're in the CIA

293
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:19,039
This faction

294
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:21,087
How could there be seven

295
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:23,647
Infection enough ideological differences

296
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:26,975
Probably not in the CIA what is it

297
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:29,023
I want more

298
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:36,191
BLTs in the lunchroom there's not even enough primary colors for them to all have different colored neckerchief

299
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:37,983
That's true

300
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:39,263
If you

301
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:45,151
The damn green Equity people over there don't do not

302
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:46,687
Do not set trip

303
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:53,087
With the f****** factions the CIA

304
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:55,135
We also know that there's only like

305
00:15:55,903 --> 00:16:02,047
Percent of them killing the rest of our chicken

306
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:06,399
Cast of Glee

307
00:16:06,655 --> 00:16:07,167
20%

308
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:09,471
Who cares anyway

309
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:14,335
This is the most important news of the day

310
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:16,895
Maybe so far

311
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:19,967
And not the day the show cuz right

312
00:16:20,991 --> 00:16:21,503
This

313
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:22,271
Next clip

314
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:24,831
Foundry f***** up

315
00:16:25,343 --> 00:16:26,879
This put your mic down for this

316
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:30,207
Oh boy oh boy oh boy

317
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:31,487
You're about to get

318
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:32,255
A history lesson

319
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:34,047
Courtesy

320
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:35,327
Emerick Jones

321
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:41,983
I just put that there too

322
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:44,543
Clear that there's no breakthrough

323
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:47,871
Lompoc

324
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:56,063
President Andrew Jackson

325
00:16:59,135 --> 00:16:59,903
A year out

326
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:02,975
You know they say

327
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:06,303
Colonel Travis this is inside baseball but it's

328
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:10,911
Down to the Alamo

329
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:17,567
To create

330
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:19,871
A chain reaction

331
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:21,663
Because they were hard

332
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:22,431
Hardcore funk

333
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:26,271
Questions

334
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:29,087
But they basically followed a rosicrucian

335
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:31,135
Founding father

336
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:32,159
Basically

337
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:32,927
Deal

338
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:42,143
They really wanted to

339
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:45,215
They wanted to die

340
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:47,519
Sacrifice against

341
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:49,311
They don't really make

342
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:57,247
Travis

343
00:17:57,503 --> 00:17:58,527
You're all going to die

344
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:00,831
Step across the line

345
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:03,135
Across just like the

346
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:17,471
Year before

347
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:19,519
And then they found

348
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:22,335
Some battles

349
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:24,383
It was a l

350
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:31,295
On that letter to my family

351
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:33,343
When he left his shine

352
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:36,671
My mom side

353
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:42,559
The other letter

354
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:45,119
That I'm not giving up

355
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:45,887
Victory or death

356
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:49,215
Antenna

357
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:54,079
And they were going

358
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:04,575
West Sam Houston

359
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:06,111
Under the direct

360
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:11,743
States of America

361
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:15,839
That was a sovereign

362
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:17,375
Country

363
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:20,959
The British Empire

364
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:25,311
Real planning real sacrifice

365
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:26,847
Real long-term commitment

366
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:35,295
He's implying that the M3 of the Merced

367
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:38,623
A couple questions

368
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:41,951
The first one I don't have any question

369
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:42,975
For what

370
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:43,999
Who is clearly self

371
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:46,815
Everything about that makes perfect

372
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:54,751
Do you know anything about Colonel Travis Colonel William Travis

373
00:19:55,007 --> 00:19:57,823
Anybody who

374
00:19:58,335 --> 00:20:00,127
Overrun by thousands

375
00:20:00,383 --> 00:20:01,663
Soldiers because he's bad at

376
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:02,431
Position

377
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:03,967
Probably didn't do so well

378
00:20:04,223 --> 00:20:09,855
Interesting

379
00:20:10,111 --> 00:20:12,415
Bye

380
00:20:12,927 --> 00:20:19,071
Get out of San Antonio

381
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:23,423
Play Pandora

382
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:27,263
Hickory Old Hickory

383
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:28,287
Planned

384
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:32,127
To tell Houston to say that to Travis

385
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:33,919
So Travis would be like

386
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:35,967
F*** you and do what

387
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:37,759
Covert action

388
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:41,599
Action at this point sections of the CIA 70

389
00:20:43,135 --> 00:20:44,415
Four of them didn't even know

390
00:20:49,535 --> 00:20:52,863
Now I think is the most appropriate time ever to talk a little bit

391
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:54,143
About Colonel William

392
00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:56,703
Travis I've never heard that song

393
00:20:56,959 --> 00:20:57,983
Before so clearly I must

394
00:20:58,239 --> 00:21:01,055
I'm going to give you a bit of a history lesson

395
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:04,127
Tickle the s*** out of me today

396
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:08,735
I initially thought there's no way I'm going to be able to get this episode together

397
00:21:10,015 --> 00:21:10,527
To do it but

398
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:11,295
I did

399
00:21:11,551 --> 00:21:12,319
This

400
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:13,343
Is a fun story

401
00:21:14,111 --> 00:21:17,184
So William Travis was born in 1809 in South Carolina

402
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:20,256
Is born in South Carolina

403
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:25,376
12 parents move to Cobb County in Alabama

404
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:26,912
Like a newly

405
00:21:27,424 --> 00:21:28,704
Brent there's a lot of

406
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,264
Steersman chip

407
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:36,640
His uncle Alexander founded a school in Sparta Alabama

408
00:21:37,152 --> 00:21:37,664
Who's apart of Connor

409
00:21:38,176 --> 00:21:39,712
William

410
00:21:39,968 --> 00:21:40,736
Chance to attend it

411
00:21:40,992 --> 00:21:42,528
He was able to get an education

412
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:45,856
He go on to be a school teacher teacher's assistant

413
00:21:46,112 --> 00:21:46,624
Different

414
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:49,184
School where he taught for less than a year

415
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:49,952
Because of

416
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:50,976
Coronavirus

417
00:21:51,232 --> 00:21:53,792
16 year olds

418
00:21:54,048 --> 00:21:55,840
So they married

419
00:21:56,864 --> 00:21:57,632
Alabama

420
00:21:57,888 --> 00:22:01,728
They married when she was 16 likely because he got her pregnant

421
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:06,080
Some time frame record show that you

422
00:22:06,336 --> 00:22:09,664
You probably gave birth before they were married

423
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:10,688
Before the marriage

424
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:11,968
I am back then that was

425
00:22:12,224 --> 00:22:15,552
That was not good

426
00:22:17,856 --> 00:22:18,368
At that point

427
00:22:18,624 --> 00:22:19,136
Eastside

428
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:20,928
Anymore

429
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:26,048
Answer human-sized wife moved and he just started

430
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:26,816
Clear Bond

431
00:22:27,072 --> 00:22:28,352
Clairborne Clairborne

432
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:29,120
Play Bar

433
00:22:29,632 --> 00:22:30,144
Hoof

434
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,424
Name

435
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:33,984
He's going to start studying law

436
00:22:34,752 --> 00:22:36,032
Rebecca and I was really easy

437
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:39,104
True

438
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:44,224
As he was studying law he also started a newspaper called the

439
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,272
Claiborne Harold

440
00:22:46,784 --> 00:22:47,552
It okay for a little while

441
00:22:48,064 --> 00:22:51,904
Made a made a little bit of coin but then it started to not make as much money

442
00:22:53,184 --> 00:22:54,720
I got to support my family I have

443
00:22:54,976 --> 00:22:55,744
Have no idea

444
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,024
Not making enough from

445
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:57,792
From the paper

446
00:22:58,048 --> 00:23:01,120
And the stress of running the paper got so bad

447
00:23:01,376 --> 00:23:03,424
He kept sucking up the paper

448
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:07,008
He would print advertisements upside down

449
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:14,688
I never learned to read expiration date

450
00:23:14,944 --> 00:23:16,992
Complete

451
00:23:17,504 --> 00:23:19,040
And

452
00:23:19,296 --> 00:23:19,808
That would go on

453
00:23:20,064 --> 00:23:20,832
How to mirror his future

454
00:23:21,856 --> 00:23:22,880
That I wrote that I'm thrilled with

455
00:23:23,392 --> 00:23:27,488
Mirror his future at the Alamo he would ask for help with the paper

456
00:23:27,744 --> 00:23:28,512
But reinforcements

457
00:23:28,768 --> 00:23:30,560
Square.com

458
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:35,168
You kept trying to get financial support Noah was helping him out

459
00:23:35,424 --> 00:23:35,936
Used

460
00:23:36,192 --> 00:23:36,704
Terrible place

461
00:23:39,264 --> 00:23:40,800
He passed his law exam

462
00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:43,360
That point borrows $55

463
00:23:43,616 --> 00:23:44,640
Thirty-seven cents

464
00:23:44,896 --> 00:23:48,480
To order

465
00:23:48,736 --> 00:23:50,272
To start

466
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:54,624
He also borrows $90 to cover his expenses with the Herald

467
00:23:55,648 --> 00:23:56,672
Unfortunately

468
00:23:56,928 --> 00:23:59,232
He wasn't getting any clients for his Law Firm

469
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:01,792
Because no one needed a lawyer

470
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:07,168
It was a small f****** town

471
00:24:09,984 --> 00:24:15,872
Who's already had a lawyer trial

472
00:24:16,128 --> 00:24:17,408
There ain't judges

473
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:24,064
Who mentored him

474
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,600
Disastrous position where you

475
00:24:25,856 --> 00:24:30,720
Spent all this money he's in debt and now we can't even make money doing log

476
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,024
You get nothing

477
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:33,792
He's getting

478
00:24:34,048 --> 00:24:35,328
Deeper and deeper into debt

479
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,632
It's so he decides to buy a couple slaves

480
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:39,680
In order to

481
00:24:40,192 --> 00:24:42,496
Problems back then

482
00:24:42,752 --> 00:24:44,544
Play slaves

483
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:47,104
Cheyenne help out right

484
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,640
But the irony of this

485
00:24:48,896 --> 00:24:52,480
Is B

486
00:24:55,296 --> 00:24:55,808
Silverline

487
00:24:57,856 --> 00:25:01,184
The tragedy of everybody everybody

488
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:04,256
Is clearly not happy she's going to

489
00:25:04,512 --> 00:25:10,656
Living with this guy whoever's buying a

490
00:25:10,912 --> 00:25:17,056
Travis is not f****** having a great time and of course is slave or not

491
00:25:19,616 --> 00:25:21,408
Who is Manchester

492
00:25:21,664 --> 00:25:23,968
And now it's interesting that you bring that up because

493
00:25:24,224 --> 00:25:24,736
Gated apartment

494
00:25:24,992 --> 00:25:25,504
Stop

495
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:30,880
So

496
00:25:31,136 --> 00:25:33,184
Shut up

497
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,464
Would you realize

498
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:37,280
Immediately after you left was a very bad idea

499
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:38,816
By the time that you stopped

500
00:25:39,072 --> 00:25:39,840
Practicing law

501
00:25:40,352 --> 00:25:40,864
Here

502
00:25:41,376 --> 00:25:43,168
Participate 6 cases

503
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,984
Idiot made $4

504
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,776
His debt at the time was

505
00:25:48,032 --> 00:25:49,312
834.

506
00:25:50,336 --> 00:25:51,872
Which is

507
00:25:59,552 --> 00:26:02,368
Andy Court you tried to argue that his case should be dismissed

508
00:26:02,624 --> 00:26:03,392
Because of infants

509
00:26:05,184 --> 00:26:08,512
Is it bad luck

510
00:26:10,048 --> 00:26:13,888
Because he was so young to be thrown out of court

511
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,680
And the court

512
00:26:18,496 --> 00:26:19,264
Subway

513
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,800
Everybody

514
00:26:21,568 --> 00:26:24,896
Everybody in the court just started laughing

515
00:26:27,456 --> 00:26:30,784
Like a historical humiliation in court

516
00:26:34,624 --> 00:26:36,928
You still owe me money you little baby

517
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:37,952
That's it

518
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:41,792
At that point the court clerk issued an order for his arrest

519
00:26:42,048 --> 00:26:42,816
On March 31st

520
00:26:43,072 --> 00:26:44,864
1831

521
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:45,632
So

522
00:26:45,888 --> 00:26:46,656
At this point

523
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:48,704
William

524
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:49,728
The Alamo

525
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:50,752
More or less

526
00:26:51,008 --> 00:26:54,080
Every starts a little plan with Andrew Jackson

527
00:26:54,336 --> 00:26:57,152
Nope nope nope I feel like we're going to get there

528
00:26:57,664 --> 00:26:59,712
He heard he hears about Texas

529
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,016
Which is at that point estate

530
00:27:02,272 --> 00:27:03,296
And the Mexican Republic

531
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,904
So he's a speculation

532
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:10,720
And there's a lot of people out there

533
00:27:10,976 --> 00:27:11,488
Lawyers

534
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:15,072
Answer you like

535
00:27:16,352 --> 00:27:17,888
The other thing is

536
00:27:18,144 --> 00:27:21,984
Has an order for his arrest Alabama

537
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:25,312
Go figure that one out he's a lawyer so at this point

538
00:27:25,568 --> 00:27:28,896
Believes his wife who is now pregnant

539
00:27:31,968 --> 00:27:32,736
Leaving the rest

540
00:27:32,992 --> 00:27:35,552
This is

541
00:27:35,808 --> 00:27:37,088
Yeah it's Rob

542
00:27:37,344 --> 00:27:38,112
Is it spectacular

543
00:27:38,368 --> 00:27:41,184
Texas

544
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,464
Center city called clock

545
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:45,536
I'm not sure if that's okay

546
00:27:45,792 --> 00:27:48,864
At that point you set up alarm practice

547
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:50,400
He starts a militia

548
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:55,776
And a start agitating against the Mexican authorities

549
00:27:56,800 --> 00:28:02,432
Because bill has their white people around a lot of next

550
00:28:02,688 --> 00:28:03,456
Always shoot

551
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:05,248
Absolutely

552
00:28:07,552 --> 00:28:10,624
His militia Behavior

553
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:15,744
Also being conscripted as a soldier and ordered to raise a company of men

554
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,792
Deport the situation in San Antonio

555
00:28:18,048 --> 00:28:20,352
The situation that would end up being the album

556
00:28:21,632 --> 00:28:25,472
Travis considered this is a quote here from an article on it

557
00:28:25,728 --> 00:28:29,568
Disobeying his orders right to Henry Smith

558
00:28:29,824 --> 00:28:33,920
I am willing they anxious to go to defensive backs are but sir

559
00:28:34,176 --> 00:28:35,712
I'm unwilling to risk my reputation

560
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:48,512
I can't I'm unwilling to risk my reputation by going off into the enemy's country with such little memes

561
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:50,304
And with them so badly equipped

562
00:28:50,816 --> 00:28:52,608
This is from an article in Texas monthly

563
00:28:52,864 --> 00:28:57,472
Travis hits Stockton Camp waiting for Smith reply which never came

564
00:28:57,984 --> 00:29:00,800
Eventually had no choice but to try John to San Antonio

565
00:29:01,056 --> 00:29:02,592
He had no military experience

566
00:29:02,848 --> 00:29:04,128
Was until recently

567
00:29:04,384 --> 00:29:05,152
Successful lawyer

568
00:29:05,408 --> 00:29:07,968
It was now the lieutenant colonel in the Texas Cowboys

569
00:29:12,832 --> 00:29:15,648
Of course Alex Jones's family knows him

570
00:29:15,904 --> 00:29:18,976
That's the same

571
00:29:20,256 --> 00:29:21,792
Hey I am going

572
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:23,840
You

573
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:26,656
Euro Euro down to San Antonio

574
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:31,520
Point but you're a little ahead of it

575
00:29:32,544 --> 00:29:33,312
So

576
00:29:35,872 --> 00:29:36,896
The picture of

577
00:29:37,152 --> 00:29:39,200
Proto Alex Jones will be complete

578
00:29:39,456 --> 00:29:41,760
Alex Jones is very clearly

579
00:29:42,016 --> 00:29:44,576
A lot of his personality on William Travis

580
00:29:45,088 --> 00:29:46,880
There is no doubt about that

581
00:29:48,672 --> 00:29:50,208
Completely see-through

582
00:29:50,464 --> 00:29:53,024
Bumbling self-motivated prick

583
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:57,632
You accidentally a lieutenant colonel

584
00:29:57,888 --> 00:30:01,984
Texas Gallery Travis and James

585
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,520
Are the two men

586
00:30:03,776 --> 00:30:05,056
You are supposed to be in charge

587
00:30:05,312 --> 00:30:06,336
Do the companies that are they

588
00:30:06,592 --> 00:30:08,640
Soldiers

589
00:30:09,152 --> 00:30:10,432
And the other in charge of knives

590
00:30:14,016 --> 00:30:14,784
Pretty quickly

591
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:15,808
Bowie gets

592
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:18,112
And for all intensive purposes

593
00:30:18,368 --> 00:30:19,904
Travis

594
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:22,208
Being in charge of all of the people

595
00:30:22,464 --> 00:30:22,976
At the Alamo

596
00:30:23,232 --> 00:30:24,512
He's in charge of the entire force

597
00:30:24,768 --> 00:30:25,280
Hilarious

598
00:30:27,328 --> 00:30:30,656
Travis ends up dying in what is a hopeless War

599
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:34,752
Cuz you'd only have like a hundred and something people there until Santa Ana

600
00:30:35,008 --> 00:30:36,288
Enforce

601
00:30:36,544 --> 00:30:38,336
Just 10 days before he died

602
00:30:38,848 --> 00:30:40,640
He sent out the following letter

603
00:30:40,896 --> 00:30:47,040
Going to read you the letter that you wrote

604
00:30:47,808 --> 00:30:51,648
You're not far off there are a number letters that I've read of his also that

605
00:30:51,904 --> 00:30:53,696
Predate this letter by like the week

606
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:58,816
Couple weeks before it all goes down know they're all just like

607
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:03,936
We need more people to send more armies

608
00:31:04,192 --> 00:31:05,984
3 Days Later another letter like fake

609
00:31:06,496 --> 00:31:09,056
It's rude for me to ask twice

610
00:31:10,848 --> 00:31:13,920
They're asking for Army's like fries

611
00:31:14,432 --> 00:31:15,456
I'll f****** tsuyu

612
00:31:16,992 --> 00:31:20,576
You know I'm going to put out a full-page ad

613
00:31:21,088 --> 00:31:22,368
This point

614
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:24,928
Before the end

615
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:31,072
It is not going to work out

616
00:31:32,608 --> 00:31:37,472
Fellow citizens and compatriots I am besieged by a thousand or more of the Mexicans under Santa Ana

617
00:31:37,728 --> 00:31:39,520
I sustained a continual bombardment

618
00:31:39,776 --> 00:31:42,336
Candidate for 24 hours and if not lost a man

619
00:31:42,592 --> 00:31:44,896
The enemy has demanded a surrender at discretion

620
00:31:45,152 --> 00:31:48,224
Otherwise of Garrison is to be put to the sword if the Ford is taken

621
00:31:50,016 --> 00:31:50,528
The cannon shot

622
00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:51,808
And our flag still waived

623
00:31:52,064 --> 00:31:53,088
Probably from the walls

624
00:31:53,344 --> 00:31:59,488
I shall never Retreat or Surrender then I call on you in the name of the liberty of patriotism and everything dear to the Amer

625
00:31:59,744 --> 00:32:01,024
American character to come to our Aid

626
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,048
With all dispatch

627
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:03,840
Danny is receiving

628
00:32:04,096 --> 00:32:05,632
Daily and will no doubt increase

629
00:32:05,888 --> 00:32:07,936
Three or four thousand in 45 days

630
00:32:08,448 --> 00:32:10,496
If this call is neglected I am determined to

631
00:32:10,752 --> 00:32:12,544
To sustain myself as long as possible

632
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:16,896
And die like a soldier who never forgets what he's doing his own honor and that of his country

633
00:32:17,152 --> 00:32:17,920
All caps

634
00:32:18,176 --> 00:32:19,200
Victory or death

635
00:32:19,712 --> 00:32:20,736
William Barret Travis

636
00:32:21,504 --> 00:32:22,784
That's what this letter goes out

637
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:24,064
Has come

638
00:32:24,576 --> 00:32:25,856
Does this letter goes out

639
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:28,928
People get really

640
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:30,720
Fired up

641
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:34,816
Remington Grill

642
00:32:35,072 --> 00:32:36,352
Is because of the like

643
00:32:37,376 --> 00:32:39,168
Pretty well-written letter

644
00:32:39,424 --> 00:32:40,192
F******

645
00:32:40,704 --> 00:32:41,216
Idiot

646
00:32:41,472 --> 00:32:44,544
Bumbling moron this Mister Magoo

647
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:50,944
Walking around through life screwing up everything

648
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:54,784
So this is also from that Texas monthly article about him

649
00:32:56,576 --> 00:32:57,600
Got this diary

650
00:32:57,856 --> 00:32:58,880
They're reading over it

651
00:32:59,392 --> 00:33:02,720
And there's one passage anywhere you setting out this like 2 years before he died

652
00:33:03,232 --> 00:33:05,024
I love to my first man

653
00:33:07,072 --> 00:33:08,864
You are so close

654
00:33:09,888 --> 00:33:11,424
You are shockingly flow

655
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:17,568
There's a passage in his diary says like I was setting off for some city

656
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:21,408
And it's the only time I had to do so many bogs

657
00:33:21,664 --> 00:33:22,688
Should I couldn't get through

658
00:33:22,944 --> 00:33:24,480
It's the only time that I

659
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:25,504
Follow through with

660
00:33:26,528 --> 00:33:28,320
Or whatever

661
00:33:29,088 --> 00:33:30,368
And so here's

662
00:33:30,624 --> 00:33:32,160
View from the Texas monthly article

663
00:33:32,672 --> 00:33:33,696
Should bring everything into Focus

664
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:35,488
Otherwise

665
00:33:35,744 --> 00:33:38,816
The other than that

666
00:33:39,072 --> 00:33:41,376
The log of his law practice

667
00:33:41,632 --> 00:33:42,400
Personal expenses

668
00:33:42,912 --> 00:33:43,936
A document by an abscessed

669
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,240
He lists his shirts and socks

670
00:33:46,752 --> 00:33:48,032
Anylist is sexual Adventure

671
00:33:48,544 --> 00:33:51,104
Someone named Susanna is recorded as his 59th

672
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:53,152
Conquest he was in 24

673
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:54,944
Think about that in terms of Alex

674
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,504
150 women before he was 16 claim

675
00:34:01,344 --> 00:34:02,880
I don't know I don't know

676
00:34:06,208 --> 00:34:12,352
That life brief underlined passage the one about not turning back

677
00:34:12,608 --> 00:34:14,912
Is the only moment of personal

678
00:34:15,168 --> 00:34:15,936
The entire document

679
00:34:16,448 --> 00:34:19,776
There is in those words Travis's unstated reproach if

680
00:34:20,032 --> 00:34:21,568
Himself for letting nature dominate his

681
00:34:21,824 --> 00:34:22,336
Intention

682
00:34:22,592 --> 00:34:24,128
He was a vain Booty Man

683
00:34:24,384 --> 00:34:25,408
Idealistic and romance

684
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:27,712
He worked hard by day and at night

685
00:34:27,968 --> 00:34:29,248
He gambled or consorted with Prost

686
00:34:29,504 --> 00:34:32,064
Attitudes Salon Reading Sir Walter Scott

687
00:34:32,576 --> 00:34:33,856
He was brainy and ambitious in

688
00:34:34,112 --> 00:34:35,136
I'm filled with passionate energy

689
00:34:35,648 --> 00:34:38,208
He spent all his short life seeking out a stage upon which

690
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:39,488
Play out his self

691
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:40,256
Appointed Destin

692
00:34:40,768 --> 00:34:44,608
The only thing he understood about himself was that he would not turn back

693
00:34:44,864 --> 00:34:46,912
He wanted to be a hero and a patriot

694
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:48,192
He became a hero in a

695
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:52,288
He wrote his famous letter from the Alamo proclaiming his new role

696
00:34:52,544 --> 00:34:53,312
In the world listen

697
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:56,128
A few Strokes of a pan made his dreams

698
00:34:56,384 --> 00:34:58,176
Real kid invented himself

699
00:34:58,432 --> 00:34:58,944
An invented

700
00:34:59,200 --> 00:34:59,712
Texas as well

701
00:35:00,736 --> 00:35:01,248
That's Alex

702
00:35:02,784 --> 00:35:04,320
That's a hundred percent Alex Jones

703
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:07,392
Why is it

704
00:35:11,488 --> 00:35:15,328
Why isn't that amazing

705
00:35:15,584 --> 00:35:16,352
2 Legend

706
00:35:16,608 --> 00:35:19,680
Well because of that great letter he wrote a great letter and that was

707
00:35:21,728 --> 00:35:24,288
The stakes are much lower back

708
00:35:24,544 --> 00:35:26,848
Because of this weird

709
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:31,200
Serta deal with the military and 7

710
00:35:31,456 --> 00:35:37,344
Do to like his bravery in the face of death Legend out of a man and that sort of thing

711
00:35:37,856 --> 00:35:40,416
That's my ring so f******

712
00:35:40,672 --> 00:35:44,256
True the idea that all his life he was speaking out a stage on which to

713
00:35:44,512 --> 00:35:45,024
Play out his

714
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,304
Self-appointed destiny

715
00:35:47,328 --> 00:35:47,840
Moody

716
00:35:48,096 --> 00:35:54,240
That's stupid that's Alec Jones's entire broadcast career it goes back to the first clip where he's like I'm building

717
00:35:54,496 --> 00:35:59,616
Myself up as a martyr he has his self-appointed beneath that he's forcing his audience

718
00:35:59,872 --> 00:36:00,640
Play out with him

719
00:36:00,896 --> 00:36:01,920
Only

720
00:36:02,176 --> 00:36:03,200
Constellation we have

721
00:36:03,456 --> 00:36:03,968
From all of this

722
00:36:04,224 --> 00:36:05,248
Is the knowledge that there's

723
00:36:05,504 --> 00:36:06,528
No way Alex

724
00:36:06,784 --> 00:36:07,552
Could write a good letter

725
00:36:07,808 --> 00:36:09,088
That's true

726
00:36:10,112 --> 00:36:13,184
Worried about him becoming a legend because his words

727
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:19,584
Super Bowl stadium

728
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:20,352
If William

729
00:36:20,608 --> 00:36:25,984
Travis had a broadcast showing you just actually got to listen to the dumb shity says he would not have

730
00:36:26,496 --> 00:36:27,520
Are you coming

731
00:36:27,776 --> 00:36:30,336
Exactly

732
00:36:30,592 --> 00:36:31,360
Do some stuff

733
00:36:31,616 --> 00:36:36,992
I mean it's just fascinated when I started to look into his history as like this unlocked

734
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:38,784
So much better

735
00:36:39,808 --> 00:36:40,320
The fact that

736
00:36:40,576 --> 00:36:43,392
Nowhere in the historical record is there any indication

737
00:36:43,904 --> 00:36:45,952
That this was a year-long plan

738
00:36:46,208 --> 00:36:48,768
Of some rosicrucian religious ceremony

739
00:36:49,024 --> 00:36:51,584
Where they sacrifice themselves to create a new Atlanta

740
00:36:52,352 --> 00:36:52,864
That's Tuff

741
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,656
Is all bulshit

742
00:36:56,192 --> 00:36:56,960
Conspiracy bulshit

743
00:36:57,216 --> 00:36:58,240
Alex is taken from

744
00:36:58,752 --> 00:37:00,032
On reputable sources

745
00:37:00,544 --> 00:37:03,360
And turned into part of this methodology

746
00:37:03,872 --> 00:37:08,736
Find out later clip

747
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:13,344
This is your back into it cuz it next month is even more f******

748
00:37:14,112 --> 00:37:15,904
If you was f***** up

749
00:37:19,232 --> 00:37:20,000
This is all

750
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:21,792
Different

00:37:23,072 --> 00:37:24,352
Religious orders

752
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,680

He died

764
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:52,768
Probably poison

00:38:05,312 --> 00:38:07,616
The devil worshiping Illuminati out of it

768
00:38:10,432 --> 00:38:11,456
The big secret

769
00:38:11,712 --> 00:38:12,224
This is it

770
00:38:18,624 --> 00:38:19,136
Boom

771
00:38:19,392 --> 00:38:20,160
Lure

772
00:38:20,416 --> 00:38:21,696
They're right

773
00:38:21,952 --> 00:38:22,720
F****** rare

774
00:38:22,976 --> 00:38:24,768
It's given down in a lure

775
00:38:25,024 --> 00:38:31,168
Alex's basically believing oral tradition as literal history you might as well believe everything that

776
00:38:38,592 --> 00:38:39,104
Country

777
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:41,408
Down from history

778
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:43,712
That

779
00:38:44,224 --> 00:38:44,992
Bucked up

780
00:38:45,248 --> 00:38:46,272
Yeah and that's a give

781
00:38:46,528 --> 00:38:50,368
Everybody's sort of understanding of what he takes

782
00:38:51,904 --> 00:38:52,672
Now a source

783
00:38:52,928 --> 00:38:54,464
If I understand him correct

784
00:38:56,768 --> 00:38:57,536
That washing

785
00:38:58,816 --> 00:39:00,096
President George Washington

786
00:39:00,352 --> 00:39:00,864
Poison

787
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:01,888
What poison

788
00:39:02,144 --> 00:39:03,424
Listen to death or at least blood

789
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:07,520
Illuminati Illuminati Squad

790
00:39:08,032 --> 00:39:10,848
Trying to recreate the lights

791
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:14,176
In order to overtake the real life

792
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:17,504
And the reason that they had to kill Washington

793
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,040
Because Washington was leading

794
00:39:19,296 --> 00:39:23,136
The good and he was going to expose it to get rid of

795
00:39:23,392 --> 00:39:25,696
Satanist with India

796
00:39:27,744 --> 00:39:30,560
3 factions of Illuminati is what

797
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,960
Maybe it was a simpler time they didn't even they couldn't

798
00:39:37,216 --> 00:39:37,728
Count to seven

799
00:39:39,264 --> 00:39:45,408
Washington

800
00:39:45,664 --> 00:39:47,456
67 years old

801
00:39:47,712 --> 00:39:49,248
Soldier in the 1700s

802
00:39:49,504 --> 00:39:54,112
So much

803
00:39:54,368 --> 00:39:56,416
There's no way it's help was good there's no way

804
00:39:56,672 --> 00:39:59,744
New business being alive at 67 quite frankly

805
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,816
So on the afternoon of December 13th 1799

806
00:40:03,072 --> 00:40:06,400
After spending most of the day December rain and snow

807
00:40:06,656 --> 00:40:08,192
Supervising activities on his estate

808
00:40:11,264 --> 00:40:14,080
One of the things you should know about George Washington

809
00:40:14,336 --> 00:40:15,104
Hey slaves

810
00:40:15,616 --> 00:40:18,688
They're going to love me like this Travis motherfuker

811
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:20,224
So are you super

812
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:22,272
Washington is super big on punctuality

813
00:40:22,784 --> 00:40:23,552
I never showed up late

814
00:40:23,808 --> 00:40:26,624
For dinner and because he was out in the rain and snow Direct

815
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:27,392
Activities

816
00:40:27,648 --> 00:40:29,952
He showed up for dinner and he didn't have time to change

817
00:40:30,208 --> 00:40:30,720
Just close

818
00:40:30,976 --> 00:40:33,280
Reset for dinner in his wet clothes from the day

819
00:40:33,536 --> 00:40:37,888
Also his wife Martha had just gotten over a really bad cold

820
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:44,288
The circumstances around complain about it

821
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:45,824
In the morning

822
00:40:47,616 --> 00:40:48,384
You developed chest

823
00:40:50,176 --> 00:40:51,456
They call for James craik

824
00:40:51,712 --> 00:40:52,736
Dr. James craik

825
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:54,016
Who was his doctor of

826
00:40:54,272 --> 00:40:55,040
40 years

827
00:40:55,808 --> 00:41:01,952
That doesn't seem like some sort of people trailer

828
00:41:03,488 --> 00:41:05,024
1766

829
00:41:05,536 --> 00:41:06,816
Yeah

830
00:41:08,608 --> 00:41:12,704
George Rawlins who was the overseer of the state

831
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:15,520
The estate came to his bedside

832
00:41:17,568 --> 00:41:18,080
How to pronounce

833
00:41:18,336 --> 00:41:19,616
Fever

834
00:41:21,152 --> 00:41:23,200
Is it 7:30 in the morning George Rollins

835
00:41:23,456 --> 00:41:25,760
Remove 12 to 14 oz

836
00:41:26,016 --> 00:41:26,784
The blood at Washington

837
00:41:28,576 --> 00:41:29,088
Bleed It

838
00:41:30,112 --> 00:41:31,904
That's what they did back then

839
00:41:32,416 --> 00:41:36,000
Washington requested that

840
00:41:36,256 --> 00:41:37,280
And then afterwards

841
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:38,048
Y'all should

842
00:41:38,304 --> 00:41:40,864
Text Amor my love

843
00:41:41,376 --> 00:41:46,752
Hazel throughout the morning later take more blood from him and tried to give him an enema the beginning of adrenochrome

844
00:41:47,008 --> 00:41:50,080
They tried all sorts of things they try that

845
00:41:50,336 --> 00:41:54,175
Tea laced with vinegar to gargle work

846
00:41:54,431 --> 00:41:55,967
Some stuff in there to make it worse

847
00:41:56,223 --> 00:42:02,367
Because then it would be like that that's friction there whatever whatever blisters

848
00:42:02,623 --> 00:42:05,951
Call the artificer

849
00:42:06,463 --> 00:42:11,583
Weirdly he did end up regaining some of his strength

850
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:13,119
But his afternoon came

851
00:42:13,375 --> 00:42:15,167
I knew you wasn't going to make it

852
00:42:15,423 --> 00:42:17,215
He was quoted as saying

853
00:42:17,471 --> 00:42:21,567
Soon enough he was struggling for air doctor

854
00:42:21,823 --> 00:42:23,103
Doctor I Die Hard

855
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:24,383
But I'm not afraid to go

856
00:42:24,639 --> 00:42:27,199
I believe from my first attack that I should not survive it

857
00:42:27,455 --> 00:42:28,735
My breath cannot last long

858
00:42:29,247 --> 00:42:31,039
Ever the gentleman even in extremes

859
00:42:31,295 --> 00:42:34,623
The general made a point of thanking all three doctors for their health

860
00:42:35,135 --> 00:42:37,183
Washington died at 10:20 p.m.

861
00:42:39,999 --> 00:42:42,303
I guess they make

862
00:42:42,815 --> 00:42:44,095
Did they made with those

863
00:42:44,351 --> 00:42:44,863
Like

864
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:48,959
We'll shift coming out of them so maybe we should just try and get the s*** out of

865
00:42:51,007 --> 00:42:55,103
It's super fun it's super f***** up is ended up taking out

866
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:56,639
80 oz of his teeth

867
00:42:57,407 --> 00:42:58,175
That's a lot

868
00:42:58,687 --> 00:43:00,223
Witches witches it's it's

869
00:43:02,271 --> 00:43:03,807
Washington survived as long as he

870
00:43:04,575 --> 00:43:07,135
Because that was really his only accomplishment like

871
00:43:07,391 --> 00:43:08,671
He was it bad General

872
00:43:09,183 --> 00:43:09,695
He wasn't good

873
00:43:09,951 --> 00:43:11,231
Tactics he wasn't

874
00:43:11,999 --> 00:43:14,047
But he looked f****** amazing on a horse

875
00:43:14,303 --> 00:43:15,583
And he should have died like

876
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:17,631
30 times never did

877
00:43:22,239 --> 00:43:22,751
Kiara

878
00:43:23,007 --> 00:43:26,591
He's got bullet holes in his shirt knows like all weird it off my watch

879
00:43:26,847 --> 00:43:28,383
Like he was that guy

880
00:43:28,895 --> 00:43:29,663
Would not die

881
00:43:29,919 --> 00:43:31,967
People still debate what it was

882
00:43:32,223 --> 00:43:33,503
Killed

883
00:43:34,015 --> 00:43:35,039
Probably

884
00:43:35,295 --> 00:43:38,111
I think it's probably underlying cause of pneumonia

885
00:43:38,367 --> 00:43:43,743
Something like that forgotten about this all about his death

886
00:43:43,999 --> 00:43:50,143
He wasn't poisoned by the Illuminati

887
00:43:51,935 --> 00:43:55,775
Alex brings up the Illuminati

888
00:43:56,031 --> 00:43:56,543
Ladders

889
00:43:58,591 --> 00:44:01,151
Is an indication of the third killed him

890
00:44:01,663 --> 00:44:03,455
As I looked into that

891
00:44:03,967 --> 00:44:05,247
The Illuminati

892
00:44:07,295 --> 00:44:13,439
I know you just recovered from a cold

893
00:44:13,695 --> 00:44:14,207
Uticaod

894
00:44:14,463 --> 00:44:15,743
I get it

895
00:44:16,511 --> 00:44:19,583
I'll get blood by the Illuminati

896
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:24,959
Guy named ew Snyder sent Washington letter on August 22nd

897
00:44:25,215 --> 00:44:26,239
1798

898
00:44:26,751 --> 00:44:30,079
I'll read the relevant portion of this letter

899
00:44:30,335 --> 00:44:30,847
To you

900
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:36,991
It was sometime sent that a book fell into my hands and titled proof of a conspiracy by John

901
00:44:37,247 --> 00:44:40,319
Which gives a full account of the Society of

902
00:44:40,831 --> 00:44:43,135
That distinguishes Itself by the name of Illuminati

903
00:44:43,391 --> 00:44:45,951
Whose plan is to overturn a government that all religion

904
00:44:46,207 --> 00:44:46,975
Even natural

905
00:44:47,231 --> 00:44:52,863
Every idea of a Supreme Being and distinguish man from Beast by his shape only

906
00:44:53,375 --> 00:44:56,959
I thought suggested itself to me that some of the lodges in the United States

907
00:44:57,215 --> 00:44:58,239
Might have caught the infection

908
00:44:58,751 --> 00:45:02,591
And my cooperate with the Illuminati or the jacobean club in France

909
00:45:02,847 --> 00:45:04,639
Jose is mentioned by Robison

910
00:45:04,895 --> 00:45:05,919
Remember

911
00:45:06,175 --> 00:45:07,967
And who can doubt if

912
00:45:08,735 --> 00:45:09,503
A day probably

913
00:45:10,527 --> 00:45:14,623
Have not those their confidence in this confidence in this country

914
00:45:14,879 --> 00:45:17,695
They use the same expressions and are generally man of no religion

915
00:45:18,975 --> 00:45:19,743
Reflection I was led

916
00:45:19,999 --> 00:45:21,535
To think that it might be within your power to

917
00:45:21,791 --> 00:45:23,839
Prevent the horrid plan from corrupting the brethren

918
00:45:24,095 --> 00:45:26,399
Of the English Lodge over which you preside

919
00:45:26,655 --> 00:45:28,703
That's why he was bled to death by the Illuminati

920
00:45:28,959 --> 00:45:30,495
Reply

921
00:45:30,751 --> 00:45:32,031
It seems like I kind of

922
00:45:32,543 --> 00:45:34,335
Reload The Illuminati's describing

923
00:45:34,847 --> 00:45:35,871
The right

924
00:45:38,175 --> 00:45:44,319
Varian Illuminati from 1776

925
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:46,111
1785

926
00:45:46,367 --> 00:45:50,207
Disbanded but everybody's like

927
00:45:50,463 --> 00:45:54,303
Mostly all day

928
00:45:54,559 --> 00:45:55,327
Interested in was like

929
00:45:55,839 --> 00:45:58,143
Rationality over Superstition dimension

930
00:46:02,751 --> 00:46:04,543
Wildly a historical

931
00:46:04,799 --> 00:46:05,567
But George Washington

932
00:46:05,823 --> 00:46:07,103
Did reply to his letter

933
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:08,895
On September 25th

934
00:46:09,151 --> 00:46:10,687
1798

935
00:46:10,943 --> 00:46:17,087
Nearest MARTA stop

936
00:46:17,343 --> 00:46:19,647
Sending me letters that take my blood magically

937
00:46:20,159 --> 00:46:21,439
Bi-Rite

938
00:46:22,207 --> 00:46:28,095
I have heard much of the nefarious and dangerous playing and doctrines of the Illuminati but never saw the book until you were pleased to send

939
00:46:28,863 --> 00:46:33,471
The same causes which is knowledge in the receipt of your letter have prevented my reading the book

940
00:46:33,727 --> 00:46:37,567
Hitherto namely the multiplicity of matters with pressed upon me before

941
00:46:37,823 --> 00:46:39,103
And debilitated state

942
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:42,431
In which I was left after a severe fever had been removed

943
00:46:44,735 --> 00:46:48,063
So you was also had a terrible fever a year before he died

944
00:46:48,575 --> 00:46:49,343
Which is

945
00:46:50,879 --> 00:46:56,255
Give me to add a little bored now

946
00:46:56,511 --> 00:46:57,023
Unfavorable sent

947
00:46:57,791 --> 00:47:03,167
Except to correct an error you have run into of my presiding over the English Lodges of this country

948
00:47:03,679 --> 00:47:05,215
The fact is I preside over none

949
00:47:05,471 --> 00:47:08,031
Nor have I ever been in one more than once or twice

950
00:47:08,287 --> 00:47:09,311
Within the last 30 years

951
00:47:09,823 --> 00:47:14,687
I believe notwithstanding that none of the lodges in this country were contaminated with the principles ascribed

952
00:47:14,943 --> 00:47:16,223
Did the Society of the Illuminati

953
00:47:16,479 --> 00:47:18,271
With respect

954
00:47:18,527 --> 00:47:20,575
Your humble servant George Washington

955
00:47:21,087 --> 00:47:21,599
So

956
00:47:21,855 --> 00:47:22,623
From that week

957
00:47:22,879 --> 00:47:23,391
Conclude

958
00:47:23,903 --> 00:47:24,927
George Washington

959
00:47:25,695 --> 00:47:26,463
Ran the Illuminati

960
00:47:26,975 --> 00:47:28,511
Heed

961
00:47:28,767 --> 00:47:31,327
Okay

962
00:47:31,583 --> 00:47:34,399
You're using my Alex logic and I don't appreciate it

963
00:47:34,655 --> 00:47:40,799
So he wasn't killed by the Illuminati

964
00:47:41,055 --> 00:47:46,431
What he says there is I've heard of this stuff which I could say to

965
00:47:46,687 --> 00:47:47,199
Exist

966
00:47:47,455 --> 00:47:52,831
In any meaningful way especially not in 1798 790

967
00:47:53,343 --> 00:47:54,879
Inasmuch as these f******

968
00:47:55,647 --> 00:47:56,671
Dillweed frizzante

969
00:47:57,951 --> 00:47:58,719
Equipment

970
00:47:58,975 --> 00:48:00,767
But that is important

971
00:48:01,023 --> 00:48:01,791
Do we now have

972
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:04,863
We got we got Washington on record to sing

973
00:48:05,375 --> 00:48:06,911
You f****** f***

974
00:48:07,167 --> 00:48:07,679
It's more like

975
00:48:07,935 --> 00:48:08,447
Come on

976
00:48:08,703 --> 00:48:09,471
Come on man

977
00:48:09,727 --> 00:48:10,239
Like

978
00:48:10,495 --> 00:48:12,799
I'm not

979
00:48:13,311 --> 00:48:14,591
I haven't even been to any

980
00:48:14,847 --> 00:48:15,615
Rademaker

981
00:48:17,919 --> 00:48:18,431
Look

982
00:48:18,687 --> 00:48:19,199
They're not

983
00:48:20,479 --> 00:48:22,015
It's more like

984
00:48:22,271 --> 00:48:23,039
Calm down

985
00:48:24,575 --> 00:48:26,879
How do you get the president to write you a letter

986
00:48:27,391 --> 00:48:28,671
The Illuminati

987
00:48:28,927 --> 00:48:33,023
Sending a lot of letters to the guys like

988
00:48:33,279 --> 00:48:34,559
It's takes up a lot of my time

989
00:48:34,815 --> 00:48:36,095
Writing back to people

990
00:48:36,351 --> 00:48:37,631
Truth

991
00:48:39,423 --> 00:48:39,935
Right now

992
00:48:41,727 --> 00:48:44,799
Aurora places like the Lone Star State

993
00:48:45,311 --> 00:48:47,103
Cyganie just reiterating that

994
00:48:47,615 --> 00:48:48,127
He gets all A's in

995
00:48:48,383 --> 00:48:52,479
Information

996
00:48:59,135 --> 00:49:00,927
In the future

997
00:49:01,183 --> 00:49:03,231
If the enemy was able to take over the rest of the country

998
00:49:08,351 --> 00:49:09,631
This country was founded

999
00:49:13,215 --> 00:49:13,727
When did they

1000
00:49:16,799 --> 00:49:20,639
And these are the type of Secrets you learn

1001
00:49:27,551 --> 00:49:29,343
It's not the secrets of Solomon

1002
00:49:32,671 --> 00:49:33,439
He was dead

1003
00:49:43,935 --> 00:49:48,287
Spoiler alert

1004
00:49:51,615 --> 00:49:52,895
Soul or

1005
00:49:53,151 --> 00:49:55,455
Podcast by what's-his-face

1006
00:49:55,711 --> 00:49:57,247
I don't know

1007
00:49:57,503 --> 00:49:58,783
Is MattyB a redoubt

1008
00:50:01,087 --> 00:50:03,647
These evil forces take over the rest of the country

1009
00:50:03,903 --> 00:50:04,927
Which sound

1010
00:50:05,183 --> 00:50:06,719
Tumi like lure

1011
00:50:06,975 --> 00:50:09,791
It also sounds to me like the grandiosity of

1012
00:50:10,047 --> 00:50:10,815
People who are

1013
00:50:11,071 --> 00:50:15,423
Nationalistic about their state which Texas certainly is

1014
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:21,823
Similar variations New York to like they have real overblown

1015
00:50:24,127 --> 00:50:26,687
Being born in or living in New York

1016
00:50:26,943 --> 00:50:27,967
Olivia's long pause

1017
00:50:28,223 --> 00:50:30,015
Because your leader that he's like

1018
00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:31,039
He's

1019
00:50:31,295 --> 00:50:36,927
Bulshit

1020
00:50:37,183 --> 00:50:37,695
I disagree with

1021
00:50:37,951 --> 00:50:41,023
I think there is that he was like

1022
00:50:41,279 --> 00:50:43,583
No no

1023
00:50:43,839 --> 00:50:46,143
You like oh no people are going to think I did

1024
00:50:46,399 --> 00:50:47,423
Just admitted to being a mason

1025
00:50:47,679 --> 00:50:52,543
I think that's what happened did you hear when you're in the right lodges

1026
00:50:53,823 --> 00:50:55,103
And the 33rd degree

1027
00:50:56,639 --> 00:50:57,919
I don't I don't

1028
00:50:58,175 --> 00:50:59,967
Necessary I'm not here to say that Alex Jones

1029
00:51:02,271 --> 00:51:05,087
I think I think the deposit is where his brain being like

1030
00:51:05,343 --> 00:51:06,367
I know how my audio

1031
00:51:06,879 --> 00:51:07,391
Thanks

1032
00:51:07,647 --> 00:51:08,415
Dammit

1033
00:51:08,671 --> 00:51:09,183
Dammit

1034
00:51:18,911 --> 00:51:19,423
Dearest

1035
00:51:19,679 --> 00:51:20,191
Martha

1036
00:51:21,215 --> 00:51:22,239
Please do bleed Alex

1037
00:51:22,495 --> 00:51:23,775
Jonesy's looking puppy

1038
00:51:24,031 --> 00:51:24,543
Today

1039
00:51:24,799 --> 00:51:26,335
Probably just hungover

1040
00:51:28,127 --> 00:51:30,175
We've now gotten like

1041
00:51:31,199 --> 00:51:31,967
Serious

1042
00:51:32,223 --> 00:51:38,367
Problems with his ideas about history that he himself has ascribed to lure which is a big problem

1043
00:51:38,623 --> 00:51:39,647
He's Reynolds

1044
00:51:39,903 --> 00:51:41,183
But you know what's more important

1045
00:51:41,439 --> 00:51:41,951
Floor

1046
00:51:42,463 --> 00:51:45,535
In the show now Alex Jones

1047
00:51:46,047 --> 00:51:48,607
Sort of gets back into a normal show right

1048
00:51:48,863 --> 00:51:50,143
It gets to talkin about

1049
00:51:51,935 --> 00:51:54,239
Until he drops that George Washington was a

1050
00:51:54,495 --> 00:51:57,055
He also was a werewolf

1051
00:51:57,311 --> 00:52:00,383
He gets back into normal show with normal-ish headlines

1052
00:52:02,687 --> 00:52:04,735
Experienced them a little bit differently

1053
00:52:06,015 --> 00:52:07,807
Two clips I believe listen to this

1054
00:52:08,319 --> 00:52:10,111
See if you get the

1055
00:52:11,903 --> 00:52:15,743
Austrian

1056
00:52:15,999 --> 00:52:17,791
Marcia Wallace

1057
00:52:29,311 --> 00:52:30,335
Feel better

1058
00:52:36,223 --> 00:52:39,295
Are there going to be

1059
00:52:39,551 --> 00:52:41,087
60%

1060
00:52:44,415 --> 00:52:46,207
Nightmare

1061
00:52:54,143 --> 00:52:56,703
I'm here

1062
00:52:57,215 --> 00:52:58,495
I'm sorry for our misogynist

1063
00:52:58,751 --> 00:53:00,031
I'm sorry for xenophobia

1064
00:53:00,543 --> 00:53:02,847
Stone Age

1065
00:53:03,103 --> 00:53:06,943
Women

1066
00:53:17,695 --> 00:53:21,791
Feminist

1067
00:53:28,447 --> 00:53:29,215
Recesses

1068
00:53:32,031 --> 00:53:33,567
Islam

1069
00:53:49,183 --> 00:53:51,743
Absolutely overrun by demons

1070
00:53:52,511 --> 00:53:53,023
So

1071
00:53:53,535 --> 00:53:54,303
I don't think it's

1072
00:53:54,559 --> 00:53:58,143
I don't think it's possible to not hear those words through new ears

1073
00:53:58,655 --> 00:53:59,423
Say they're coming for

1074
00:54:00,703 --> 00:54:02,751
Well Texas at the redoubt

1075
00:54:03,263 --> 00:54:03,775
Do you know

1076
00:54:06,847 --> 00:54:07,871
If you conceived this

1077
00:54:10,687 --> 00:54:12,735
Centuries-long fight

1078
00:54:12,991 --> 00:54:14,527
Between religious factions

1079
00:54:16,575 --> 00:54:17,855
This is insanity

1080
00:54:18,111 --> 00:54:19,135
Like this

1081
00:54:19,391 --> 00:54:20,671
To the point where

1082
00:54:20,927 --> 00:54:23,999
He misrepresents literally every piece of History

1083
00:54:24,255 --> 00:54:25,279
30 tries to ascribe

1084
00:54:25,535 --> 00:54:26,047
To anything

1085
00:54:26,815 --> 00:54:27,327
I don't

1086
00:54:27,583 --> 00:54:28,095
No

1087
00:54:28,607 --> 00:54:29,375
It kind of feels like

1088
00:54:29,631 --> 00:54:31,167
He still thinks we're fighting in the Crusade

1089
00:54:31,679 --> 00:54:32,447
I think he does

1090
00:54:32,703 --> 00:54:34,495
Yeah

1091
00:54:34,751 --> 00:54:37,055
It feels like he goes back that far as like

1092
00:54:37,311 --> 00:54:42,175
The Knights Templar were actually my great great great great great grandfather's were they

1093
00:54:42,431 --> 00:54:42,943
F*** it f***

1094
00:54:43,199 --> 00:54:44,223
Until we got Travis

1095
00:54:44,479 --> 00:54:45,759
Travis Newman family

1096
00:54:46,015 --> 00:54:49,855
I'm Confederate royalty

1097
00:54:50,111 --> 00:54:53,951
References if Alex is related to The Heirs

1098
00:54:54,975 --> 00:54:55,999
That is true

1099
00:54:56,511 --> 00:54:58,815
But I don't know if he's related to do that family at all

1100
00:54:59,071 --> 00:55:01,119
Through his mom side I have no idea but

1101
00:55:01,375 --> 00:55:07,519
Colonel Travis

1102
00:55:08,031 --> 00:55:09,823
He says I might

1103
00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:10,847
I might make it

1104
00:55:12,383 --> 00:55:13,919
I could I could make it

1105
00:55:14,175 --> 00:55:15,455
But like did the thing is

1106
00:55:15,711 --> 00:55:20,831
This friction McGee season this idea that we're being overrun with these false immigrant

1107
00:55:21,343 --> 00:55:22,879
I'm sort of a

1108
00:55:23,135 --> 00:55:25,183
Plan to destroy the new Atlantis

1109
00:55:26,207 --> 00:55:27,999
That's a piece of this bigger stuff

1110
00:55:28,255 --> 00:55:29,279
And that bigger stuff

1111
00:55:29,791 --> 00:55:30,303
Is

1112
00:55:30,559 --> 00:55:31,583
Re-up

1113
00:55:32,863 --> 00:55:33,887
F****** lore

1114
00:55:34,399 --> 00:55:35,423
Straight up

1115
00:55:36,191 --> 00:55:41,567
Fanfiction the people have written about history Reddit trying to explain some very difficult things

1116
00:55:42,079 --> 00:55:42,847
Throughout history

1117
00:55:43,103 --> 00:55:45,407
It's a convenient excuse for why things that happen

1118
00:55:45,919 --> 00:55:48,991
Additionally it's a convenient excuse for trying to scapegoat Jews

1119
00:55:49,247 --> 00:55:50,783
Repeatedly throughout history

1120
00:55:51,039 --> 00:55:52,319
That those sorts of things

1121
00:55:52,575 --> 00:55:55,391
Or even take dues out of it your political opponent

1122
00:55:55,647 --> 00:55:57,695
Like those sort of easy

1123
00:55:59,999 --> 00:56:01,279
Scapegoat tricks

1124
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:05,887
You see historically throughout the history of the Illuminati lore

1125
00:56:06,399 --> 00:56:07,679
And Alex believe all of it

1126
00:56:08,191 --> 00:56:10,751
He's making it clear he believes all of it

1127
00:56:11,263 --> 00:56:12,543
And he believes

1128
00:56:14,591 --> 00:56:15,103
That this

1129
00:56:16,383 --> 00:56:18,943
That's what he thinks because the Deep State stuff is

1130
00:56:22,527 --> 00:56:23,295
Sonaze

1131
00:56:23,551 --> 00:56:24,575
Surprised he loves Trump

1132
00:56:24,831 --> 00:56:26,879
If I heard that clip

1133
00:56:27,135 --> 00:56:29,695
Write a much earlier I think that I could have peace

1134
00:56:29,951 --> 00:56:31,231
A little bit together

1135
00:56:31,487 --> 00:56:37,631
In terms of ice

1136
00:56:39,679 --> 00:56:44,031
To say something like that in public

1137
00:56:44,287 --> 00:56:45,055
S******* country

1138
00:56:47,103 --> 00:56:49,663
The more than $130,000

1139
00:56:49,919 --> 00:56:50,431
To keep that quiet

1140
00:56:50,687 --> 00:56:53,759
In the same way Alex Jones

1141
00:56:54,015 --> 00:56:55,039
Steve's Colonel William

1142
00:56:55,295 --> 00:56:55,807
Travis

1143
00:56:56,063 --> 00:56:56,575
Himself

1144
00:56:56,831 --> 00:56:57,855
He's created

1145
00:56:58,111 --> 00:56:59,135
His own mythology

1146
00:56:59,391 --> 00:56:59,903
The mirroring

1147
00:57:01,183 --> 00:57:03,231
Travis's

1148
00:57:03,743 --> 00:57:04,255
I think he

1149
00:57:04,511 --> 00:57:05,023
Casey's truck

1150
00:57:05,535 --> 00:57:06,303
In there too

1151
00:57:08,607 --> 00:57:09,631
Cuz the way you

1152
00:57:09,887 --> 00:57:10,655
He portrays Trump

1153
00:57:10,911 --> 00:57:11,935
Is being up against it

1154
00:57:12,447 --> 00:57:13,471
Nothing but enemies

1155
00:57:13,727 --> 00:57:15,007
Around

1156
00:57:15,263 --> 00:57:17,311
He's he's creating

1157
00:57:17,567 --> 00:57:18,591
The Alamo

1158
00:57:18,847 --> 00:57:19,359
Around

1159
00:57:19,615 --> 00:57:20,383
Trump

1160
00:57:20,639 --> 00:57:22,687
The same time it's just more I mean

1161
00:57:22,943 --> 00:57:24,479
You could you could say that but it's

1162
00:57:24,991 --> 00:57:28,063
I think it's probably more just a situation where it's like

1163
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:29,855
The more enemies Trump

1164
00:57:30,111 --> 00:57:30,623
Cruise

1165
00:57:30,879 --> 00:57:31,647
The more he likes

1166
00:57:31,903 --> 00:57:32,415
Trump

1167
00:57:33,439 --> 00:57:38,047
Like he just has to double to some extent only makes him

1168
00:57:38,303 --> 00:57:39,327
Like Trump more

1169
00:57:39,583 --> 00:57:41,375
Simply because that puts him back

1170
00:57:41,631 --> 00:57:44,191
In The Outsider position that we know he loves so much

1171
00:57:44,703 --> 00:57:49,055
Like if the person who knows he's up against it

1172
00:57:49,311 --> 00:57:50,079
Has no chance of

1173
00:57:50,335 --> 00:57:51,103
Coming out alive

1174
00:57:51,359 --> 00:57:55,711
Like he believe Colonel Travis was right

1175
00:57:59,551 --> 00:58:00,063
Bright

1176
00:58:02,623 --> 00:58:03,647
Yeah I guess so

1177
00:58:03,903 --> 00:58:04,671
But

1178
00:58:04,927 --> 00:58:07,487
Bubbling up

1179
00:58:14,143 --> 00:58:17,215
Alex Costa

1180
00:58:18,239 --> 00:58:24,383
And prediction that we can look at

1181
00:58:24,639 --> 00:58:27,711
Write a letter saying take care of my boy he would write a letter saying

1182
00:58:27,967 --> 00:58:28,735
Wait I have kids

1183
00:58:28,991 --> 00:58:30,271
Yeah exactly

1184
00:58:31,039 --> 00:58:33,599
Hillary Clinton

1185
00:58:33,855 --> 00:58:35,647
Obama is

1186
00:58:42,303 --> 00:58:44,351
The offering him

1187
00:59:00,735 --> 00:59:02,015
Is pure misogynist

1188
00:59:02,271 --> 00:59:03,807
Criticizing

1189
00:59:05,343 --> 00:59:06,879
Is Peter daou I don't really care

1190
00:59:07,391 --> 00:59:08,159
Noah criticizing

1191
00:59:08,415 --> 00:59:09,695
Mama's criticizing

1192
00:59:09,951 --> 00:59:11,743
What sugar is

1193
00:59:11,999 --> 00:59:12,767
We're not against you

1194
00:59:18,911 --> 00:59:19,423
We just

1195
00:59:19,679 --> 00:59:20,447
We just want to stop

1196
00:59:25,311 --> 00:59:30,687
I want a free

1197
00:59:31,199 --> 00:59:32,991
Like that

1198
00:59:36,831 --> 00:59:38,623
Don't get the metaphor of the Omega

1199
00:59:41,439 --> 00:59:42,463
Long-ass

1200
00:59:42,719 --> 00:59:43,487
ReliaCard

1201
00:59:43,743 --> 00:59:48,095
Frustrated about the Omega Man that I am about anything else

1202
00:59:48,351 --> 00:59:48,863
Play weight set

1203
00:59:49,119 --> 00:59:49,631
So far tonight

1204
00:59:54,239 --> 00:59:55,007
I mean first of all

1205
00:59:55,519 --> 00:59:58,335
The only way you understand world is through movies

1206
00:59:59,359 --> 01:00:00,895
But then even Beyond

1207
01:00:01,151 --> 01:00:03,455
Really really

1208
01:00:03,711 --> 01:00:06,271
Women

1209
01:00:06,527 --> 01:00:10,623
Take away the idea of any complaints about it

1210
01:00:11,135 --> 01:00:13,183
But just the idea

1211
01:00:13,695 --> 01:00:19,839
Women are so stupid today just love her cuz she's a woman and scream at me because I have cancer

1212
01:00:20,351 --> 01:00:23,935
In his in his Omega Man metaphor

1213
01:00:24,191 --> 01:00:26,751
The I have the answer is women shut up

1214
01:00:27,007 --> 01:00:27,519
Right

1215
01:00:27,775 --> 01:00:33,663
Then they won't listen they won't listen I have the answer and it's stay in your place but that's the problem that I have with

1216
01:00:33,919 --> 01:00:36,479
His analysis of the Omega Man

1217
01:00:36,735 --> 01:00:38,271
The point of the Omega Man was

1218
01:00:39,039 --> 01:00:39,807
She's the month

1219
01:00:40,319 --> 01:00:41,855
Right

1220
01:00:42,623 --> 01:00:46,975
It's him he's the murderer he's the killer of these people

1221
01:00:47,487 --> 01:00:49,791
I guess Alex.

1222
01:00:50,047 --> 01:00:51,839
Is asking the wrong way

1223
01:00:52,095 --> 01:00:58,239
Is Alex weirdly every now and again he is right and unintentionally

1224
01:01:00,287 --> 01:01:03,359
Because I'm the monster

1225
01:01:04,127 --> 01:01:06,687
Somebody should have explained that move

1226
01:01:06,943 --> 01:01:10,783
I need to stop drinking NyQuil before the movies

1227
01:01:11,039 --> 01:01:11,551
Vincent Price

1228
01:01:12,063 --> 01:01:13,599
I like the Will Smith version

1229
01:01:14,367 --> 01:01:15,903

The studio cuz they need to talk about the Bundy situation

1234
01:01:29,983 --> 01:01:31,007
I've been at the comp

1235
01:01:31,519 --> 01:01:32,031
You been

1236
01:01:35,103 --> 01:01:38,175
To the Wildlife Preserve

1237
01:01:38,431 --> 01:01:41,759
Santa Bunkerville to the original cops

1238
01:01:43,039 --> 01:01:43,807
And so Joe Biggs

1239
01:01:45,343 --> 01:01:47,903
In conversation

1240
01:01:50,463 --> 01:01:56,607
He's really only had one story everywhere

1241
01:01:56,863 --> 01:01:59,423
Menus at that their Wildlife Reserve

1242
01:01:59,679 --> 01:02:04,543
Paid to eat pizza everyone's got to look it over themselves it is clip

1243
01:02:04,799 --> 01:02:06,079
Alex Jones had something

1244
01:02:06,335 --> 01:02:07,615
Preposterous

1245
01:02:07,871 --> 01:02:08,639
About the Bundys

1246
01:02:09,919 --> 01:02:14,015
Demonizes fuses as a

1247
01:02:14,271 --> 01:02:18,367
Maybe to set an example for what the government wanted to do two people like this

1248
01:02:18,623 --> 01:02:20,159
Two so-called right-wingers

1249
01:02:23,231 --> 01:02:23,743
They did get beat

1250
01:02:23,999 --> 01:02:25,279
Back in the bottom

1251
01:02:26,047 --> 01:02:30,911
What's the standoff on the Bunny Ranch

1252
01:02:31,423 --> 01:02:32,447
Pads

1253
01:02:32,703 --> 01:02:33,471
Surrender

1254
01:02:35,263 --> 01:02:37,311
Deschutes

1255
01:02:39,871 --> 01:02:41,407
Lexington Concord

1256
01:02:49,087 --> 01:02:51,647
That would have kicked off a revolution

1257
01:02:51,903 --> 01:02:55,743
What if we see buddy the revolution techshop in the wrong way and we shoot first

1258
01:02:55,999 --> 01:02:57,279
Gives the enemy

1259
01:03:02,399 --> 01:03:02,911
So

1260
01:03:04,703 --> 01:03:05,215
Willie

1261
01:03:05,983 --> 01:03:07,519
To die for the

1262
01:03:08,543 --> 01:03:09,311
Text David Knight

1263
01:03:09,567 --> 01:03:10,335
Exact on the scene

1264
01:03:14,431 --> 01:03:15,199
If they had killed David

1265
01:03:15,455 --> 01:03:18,783
Good night my man my man

1266
01:03:19,295 --> 01:03:24,927
They could have one but we all do that

1267
01:03:25,183 --> 01:03:27,487
If it killed

1268
01:03:27,743 --> 01:03:28,255
The hics

1269
01:03:28,511 --> 01:03:29,279
When the revolution

1270
01:03:29,535 --> 01:03:30,047
Can everybody knows

1271
01:03:31,071 --> 01:03:32,607
That's absolutely this is just

1272
01:03:34,143 --> 01:03:35,423
Over Monopoly over

1273
01:03:35,679 --> 01:03:36,191
Number of arrests

1274
01:03:36,447 --> 01:03:37,215
Exactly

1275
01:03:37,471 --> 01:03:37,983
Makes perfect

1276
01:03:41,311 --> 01:03:42,079
2

1277
01:03:42,591 --> 01:03:44,639
Describe

1278
01:03:50,527 --> 01:03:52,319
Coordinates on Martin Luther King Day

1279
01:03:52,575 --> 01:03:53,599
Who's got makes me on

1280
01:03:53,855 --> 01:03:54,367
Comfortable

1281
01:03:54,879 --> 01:03:56,927
But

1282
01:03:59,231 --> 01:04:01,535
I'm so glad we didn't do today

1283
01:04:01,791 --> 01:04:03,839
I don't know if I can handle hearing more

1284
01:04:04,095 --> 01:04:04,863
People compare White

1285
01:04:05,119 --> 01:04:05,887
People to

1286
01:04:11,007 --> 01:04:13,311
Aman Bundy

1287
01:04:13,567 --> 01:04:15,359
Was the Martin Luther King jr. of the Mormon

1288
01:04:15,871 --> 01:04:18,943
In this next clip

1289
01:04:19,199 --> 01:04:20,223
But this is

1290
01:04:20,479 --> 01:04:21,247
So

1291
01:04:22,015 --> 01:04:23,551
Barking dog whistle racist

1292
01:04:23,807 --> 01:04:24,831
It makes me

1293
01:04:25,343 --> 01:04:27,391
Hurts my ears

1294
01:04:28,159 --> 01:04:31,743
Like I said I've been a big supporter

1295
01:04:34,303 --> 01:04:37,119
Bunnies mother before and things like that and

1296
01:04:37,375 --> 01:04:40,959
And in had conversations with them I do believe that they have parent engines

1297
01:04:41,215 --> 01:04:44,799
The deep down inside they don't really have any ill intention whatsoever

1298
01:04:45,055 --> 01:04:48,383
What they were doing they were truly trying to make another Stan

1299
01:04:48,895 --> 01:04:52,735
And I just like I said I thought this was just a knot at the right place

1300
01:04:53,247 --> 01:04:57,087
I know but then you have that left again coming out with I don't get stained white tear

1301
01:04:57,343 --> 01:05:00,415
You know you have all these people on Twitter coming out last night saying oh great

1302
01:05:06,303 --> 01:05:12,447
Black lives matters people

1303
01:05:13,215 --> 01:05:15,263
And they also sit there and

1304
01:05:19,871 --> 01:05:22,687
They're just disconnected dumb stupid

1305
01:05:22,943 --> 01:05:27,807
Today what happened Morrison Tom didn't get the

1306
01:05:28,319 --> 01:05:31,391
Probably hardly anybody out there really Manning up late

1307
01:05:31,647 --> 01:05:32,671
It's in the middle of nowhere

1308
01:05:33,951 --> 01:05:37,023
Lately they quote-unquote break-in at his Federal facility

1309
01:05:37,279 --> 01:05:38,815
And what do I see them doing when I'm down there

1310
01:05:39,071 --> 01:05:39,583
Sweeping

1311
01:05:39,839 --> 01:05:41,119
Cleaning off the sidewalk

1312
01:05:41,375 --> 01:05:43,167
Taking care of the property the land

1313
01:05:43,423 --> 01:05:44,447
Making sure it's fine

1314
01:05:44,703 --> 01:05:48,031
I didn't see any black lives matter and Ferguson break into a store

1315
01:05:50,079 --> 01:05:52,383
And rearranging stuff

1316
01:05:52,639 --> 01:05:53,407
Running out

1317
01:05:55,455 --> 01:05:55,967
So

1318
01:05:57,503 --> 01:05:58,015
Awful

1319
01:05:58,783 --> 01:05:59,551
Off

1320
01:05:59,807 --> 01:06:01,087
For a number of reasons

1321
01:06:01,599 --> 01:06:04,415
First of all Alex correctly his reason

1322
01:06:05,183 --> 01:06:06,719
If I steal your TV

1323
01:06:07,231 --> 01:06:10,303
I'm dusting It Off

1324
01:06:11,839 --> 01:06:17,983

01:06:29,503 --> 01:06:30,527
But you're not going to slip and fall

1328
01:06:30,783 --> 01:06:36,927
There's an irony to Alex Jones being like

1329
01:06:37,695 --> 01:06:39,231
20 seconds later being like

1330
01:06:39,487 --> 01:06:43,327
I didn't seem to clean up all these white people

1331
01:06:43,839 --> 01:06:46,399
Reality of that is quite

1332
01:06:52,031 --> 01:06:53,823
Trenches full of poop

1333
01:06:54,079 --> 01:06:58,687
Malheur National Wildlife Refuge

1334
01:06:58,943 --> 01:07:00,991
Ended more than a month ago but yet damage

1335
01:07:03,039 --> 01:07:05,599
To get I gathered to protest the federal government's management of Pub

1336
01:07:05,855 --> 01:07:06,367
Lance

1337
01:07:07,647 --> 01:07:11,487
The total cost of the occupation stands at about six million dollars to the Federal

1338
01:07:11,999 --> 01:07:15,071
In addition to $3000000 already pitched in by the state of Oregon

1339
01:07:15,583 --> 01:07:19,167
Martha have a lot of backpack

1340
01:07:19,679 --> 01:07:23,263
Assistant Regional director of USF

1341
01:07:23,519 --> 01:07:24,287
WS

1342
01:07:24,543 --> 01:07:27,871
7 million dollars have been flagged just for repairs

1343
01:07:28,127 --> 01:07:29,663
And cleaning of the reserve itself

1344
01:07:30,175 --> 01:07:34,783
Home warned that nearly two million dollar clean up cost is a moving figure subject change

1345
01:07:35,039 --> 01:07:35,807
As the agency

1346
01:07:36,063 --> 01:07:38,367
Conduct a thorough inventory of what was broken and what

1347
01:07:38,623 --> 01:07:39,135
Missing

1348
01:07:39,391 --> 01:07:42,207
So here's where it gets here here's where it gets really important

1349
01:07:44,255 --> 01:07:44,767
So

1350
01:07:45,279 --> 01:07:46,559
They made those buck

1351
01:07:46,815 --> 01:07:48,607
It's a poop and what-have-you right

1352
01:07:48,863 --> 01:07:49,631
And that's one thing

1353
01:07:50,911 --> 01:07:57,055
A report released in February by the FBI said quote significant amounts of human feces were found on site after the occupier surrender

1354
01:07:57,567 --> 01:07:59,359
Next to a sensitive cultural site

1355
01:07:59,615 --> 01:08:01,407
Containing artifact sacred to the bird

1356
01:08:01,663 --> 01:08:02,431
Tribe

1357
01:08:02,943 --> 01:08:05,247
Great is that

1358
01:08:08,575 --> 01:08:13,183
Metaphor right there

1359
01:08:13,439 --> 01:08:17,535
Bid on the Note Homestead Wildlife Refuge will recover eventually

1360
01:08:17,791 --> 01:08:20,863
Concerned that the militia members may have harmed 8 of American artifacts

1361
01:08:21,119 --> 01:08:23,423
Or destroyed other records which are irreplaceable

1362
01:08:24,191 --> 01:08:26,239
Nature is durable it'll be just fine Homestead

1363
01:08:26,495 --> 01:08:28,543
Buildings and property or fixable or replaced

1364
01:08:28,799 --> 01:08:29,311
Well they'll be fine

1365
01:08:29,567 --> 01:08:32,127
The community will strengthen as a result of

1366
01:08:32,639 --> 01:08:34,431
However damages the tribal artifacts

1367
01:08:34,943 --> 01:08:35,455
Heinous

1368
01:08:36,735 --> 01:08:39,039
Missing lost or missing biological data

1369
01:08:39,295 --> 01:08:40,319
Could be impossible to replicate

1370
01:08:41,087 --> 01:08:43,391
Already on the job

1371
01:08:43,903 --> 01:08:46,975
Bob Library

1372
01:08:47,231 --> 01:08:47,743
64 charger

1373
01:08:47,999 --> 01:08:48,767
Federal conspiracy

1374
01:08:49,023 --> 01:08:53,119
Remind everybody

1375
01:08:53,631 --> 01:08:54,143
Scott free

1376
01:08:54,399 --> 01:09:00,543
Did cause a lot of damage to Sacred site

1377
01:09:00,799 --> 01:09:03,103
Criminal time for

1378
01:09:03,359 --> 01:09:07,455
For them to drive home the point that Alex Jones excuse is all white

1379
01:09:07,711 --> 01:09:08,735
Behavior here is it

1380
01:09:08,991 --> 01:09:12,063
Terrorism is Justified

1381
01:09:12,319 --> 01:09:12,831
Fair enough

1382
01:09:13,087 --> 01:09:13,855
There would be

1383
01:09:14,879 --> 01:09:15,903
Oarfish

1384
01:09:16,159 --> 01:09:16,927
At the meeting

1385
01:09:25,119 --> 01:09:27,423
I've had them no exaggeration

1386
01:09:27,679 --> 01:09:28,191
Bustime

1387
01:09:44,575 --> 01:09:45,343
I don't know about that

1388
01:09:47,135 --> 01:09:48,415
If true

1389
01:09:48,671 --> 01:09:49,951
We got a Hardison better

1390
01:09:51,999 --> 01:09:54,047
For real

1391
01:09:54,303 --> 01:09:55,071
Not a good one

1392
01:09:57,375 --> 01:09:58,399
Hey Alec

1393
01:09:59,935 --> 01:10:01,215
Go blow up the police station

1394
01:10:01,471 --> 01:10:04,799
If you're living the kind of life

1395
01:10:05,055 --> 01:10:08,639
We're 30 times in your twenty-year career

1396
01:10:08,895 --> 01:10:10,431
Someone is come up to you

1397
01:10:10,687 --> 01:10:11,455
Real or not

1398
01:10:11,711 --> 01:10:17,087
And suggested you blow up you're not doing a good job you're in a bad line of work

1399
01:10:17,599 --> 01:10:23,743
You're attracting the wrong crowd and now I vote

1400
01:10:30,399 --> 01:10:31,679
I listen to the show

1401
01:10:33,983 --> 01:10:35,519
I really hope

1402
01:10:37,567 --> 01:10:38,335
It's time to go blow up

1403
01:10:38,591 --> 01:10:44,479
If you're a cop or you're just playing a prank

1404
01:10:44,735 --> 01:10:48,319
I think you would probably run away if I was just

1405
01:10:49,087 --> 01:10:51,391
Zirkops

1406
01:10:51,647 --> 01:10:54,463
It happened 30 times but be that as it may

1407
01:10:54,719 --> 01:10:55,231
Beds

1408
01:10:55,487 --> 01:10:55,999
All of them

1409
01:10:56,255 --> 01:10:58,815
At this point in the episode Alex brings on

1410
01:10:59,071 --> 01:11:00,863
Is Big CIA whistleblower

1411
01:11:01,119 --> 01:11:01,887
Tosh Plumlee

1412
01:11:04,191 --> 01:11:07,007
Tosh Plumlee .0 right

1413
01:11:07,519 --> 01:11:08,799
I don't care

1414
01:11:09,055 --> 01:11:10,335
I don't really care

1415
01:11:10,591 --> 01:11:11,103
But

1416
01:11:11,359 --> 01:11:12,127
Answered

1417
01:11:13,407 --> 01:11:13,919
When does Tasha

1418
01:11:15,199 --> 01:11:19,295
8 fraction.

1419
01:11:19,551 --> 01:11:25,695
All they do is blow up

1420
01:11:25,951 --> 01:11:29,279
Asians with the help of minor radio personalities

1421
01:11:30,815 --> 01:11:34,399
In his interview though there's one thing I wanted to play for you cuz I think it's really interest

1422
01:11:34,655 --> 01:11:36,191
I think it's a very very

1423
01:11:36,959 --> 01:11:38,751
If you listen to this closely

1424
01:11:39,263 --> 01:11:40,031
I think

1425
01:11:40,543 --> 01:11:41,311
Veritas

1426
01:11:41,567 --> 01:11:42,079
Plumlee

1427
01:11:42,335 --> 01:11:43,615
Pointing a finger at Alex

1428
01:11:44,895 --> 01:11:49,503
I don't know if that's the case of assholes doing this

1429
01:11:50,271 --> 01:11:52,063
No I think he's subtly

1430
01:11:52,831 --> 01:11:53,855
Trying to be like

1431
01:11:54,623 --> 01:11:55,391
Giving

1432
01:11:55,647 --> 01:11:56,671
Hints to the audio

1433
01:11:57,439 --> 01:11:58,463
For something like this

1434
01:11:58,975 --> 01:12:02,559
I would say that I don't think I've heard top Plumlee on the show in a long

1435
01:12:02,815 --> 01:12:03,327
Time

1436
01:12:03,583 --> 01:12:04,863
Heather maybe like

1437
01:12:05,119 --> 01:12:09,727
There might be a thing where he's I got to want to come on your show anymore I don't know I'm not entirely sure I don't

1438
01:12:09,983 --> 01:12:10,751
I don't have the statistic

1439
01:12:11,007 --> 01:12:12,799
Text back that up on 2 weeks ago and

1440
01:12:13,055 --> 01:12:14,335
I just met the sheriff something like that

1441
01:12:14,591 --> 01:12:15,615
But there are things that

1442
01:12:15,871 --> 01:12:16,895
He's staying in this clip

1443
01:12:17,407 --> 01:12:19,199
That are

1444
01:12:19,455 --> 01:12:19,967
Like

1445
01:12:22,783 --> 01:12:23,807
I think I'll pick up on

1446
01:12:25,343 --> 01:12:26,623
Wow you're so incredible

1447
01:12:26,879 --> 01:12:28,415
Illusionary Warfare training

1448
01:12:28,927 --> 01:12:31,743
Well that's what it is

1449
01:12:35,327 --> 01:12:38,399
If you can control their Communications if you want a war

1450
01:12:38,911 --> 01:12:41,983
Are you going to Pickaway

1451
01:12:48,127 --> 01:12:53,759
We've had Mockingbird that's an old CIA project qualify something here on CIA

1452
01:12:55,039 --> 01:12:59,647
There are people that are

1453
01:13:05,023 --> 01:13:08,351
We have

1454
01:13:10,911 --> 01:13:14,239
I'm talking about a Shadow Warriors

1455
01:13:14,495 --> 01:13:18,079
Autumn Shadow Warriors on organizations and things like that

1456
01:13:27,039 --> 01:13:28,831
Exactly what the hell we're getting right

1457
01:13:29,087 --> 01:13:31,647
The big foundations

1458
01:13:32,159 --> 01:13:32,927
Run

1459
01:13:33,183 --> 01:13:33,951
But have

1460
01:13:34,207 --> 01:13:35,743
Security clearance

1461
01:13:35,999 --> 01:13:37,791
The clandestine dirty

1462
01:13:39,071 --> 01:13:40,351
Program

1463
01:13:41,375 --> 01:13:44,703
And so what time is the local police the FBI or the CIA don't know

1464
01:13:45,215 --> 01:13:47,519
Foundations that are even above

1465
01:13:48,031 --> 01:13:50,847
The program

1466
01:13:51,103 --> 01:13:52,127
Here in the United States

1467
01:13:52,895 --> 01:13:56,223
Right on the head Alex okay

1468
01:13:59,039 --> 01:14:01,599
Organization

1469
01:14:08,511 --> 01:14:09,023
So

1470
01:14:09,791 --> 01:14:10,559
3 things

1471
01:14:11,071 --> 01:14:12,607
They were said within that clip

1472
01:14:12,863 --> 01:14:14,655
Criticism

1473
01:14:15,167 --> 01:14:17,983
That are in the Auntie Alex Jones online

1474
01:14:18,239 --> 01:14:19,007
Community

1475
01:14:19,519 --> 01:14:20,031
The first

1476
01:14:20,543 --> 01:14:21,567
Is that idea

1477
01:14:21,823 --> 01:14:22,335
Of

1478
01:14:22,591 --> 01:14:24,639
Communications people are probably the most

1479
01:14:24,895 --> 01:14:27,455
Suspicious is the biggest mouth

1480
01:14:27,711 --> 01:14:29,503
Piece of the Patriot community

1481
01:14:29,759 --> 01:14:31,039
He is the communications

1482
01:14:31,295 --> 01:14:31,807
Aspect

1483
01:14:32,063 --> 01:14:35,903
Of that entire operation and Alex

1484
01:14:36,159 --> 01:14:37,439
His own words

1485
01:14:37,951 --> 01:14:39,487
Implicate him and big like

1486
01:14:43,327 --> 01:14:46,143
Himself

1487
01:14:46,399 --> 01:14:47,935
So the second thing

1488
01:14:48,191 --> 01:14:49,727
Is the idea that Alex Jones

1489
01:14:49,983 --> 01:14:51,263
Desensitizes people

1490
01:14:51,519 --> 01:14:52,543
To the situation

1491
01:14:53,055 --> 01:14:55,615
Fat people the powers-that-be

1492
01:14:55,871 --> 01:14:57,919
Sensitized so they accept their

1493
01:14:58,175 --> 01:15:02,271
We have this powerful globalist

1494
01:15:02,783 --> 01:15:07,391
Who have their fingers in every pie that they control all 7 factions of the CIA

1495
01:15:08,671 --> 01:15:09,951
The secret 85

1496
01:15:16,607 --> 01:15:17,375
Conspiracy

1497
01:15:17,631 --> 01:15:18,143
That exist

1498
01:15:18,399 --> 01:15:18,911
Iron

1499
01:15:19,167 --> 01:15:20,703
Clyde pedophile blackmail

1500
01:15:20,959 --> 01:15:25,311
That want to kill your children and drink their blood and all their stuff and all they're going to do

1501
01:15:25,823 --> 01:15:27,103
Trying to f*** with you

1502
01:15:27,615 --> 01:15:29,919
Like making you depressed through the water

1503
01:15:30,175 --> 01:15:31,455
The chemicals in the water

1504
01:15:31,711 --> 01:15:37,855
India is going to lie to you all the time there's going to be fake terrorist that are going to run you over with

1505
01:15:38,111 --> 01:15:39,647
With a car You're Not Safe in public

1506
01:15:39,903 --> 01:15:41,951
This idea is

1507
01:15:42,207 --> 01:15:43,487
Against them except by giving me my

1508
01:15:47,327 --> 01:15:50,911
But like the idea that his role in the whole game plan

1509
01:15:51,167 --> 01:15:52,703
Desensitizing people to

1510
01:15:52,959 --> 01:15:53,727
Be able to

1511
01:15:53,983 --> 01:15:55,007
Can't fight back

1512
01:15:57,055 --> 01:15:57,567
To direct

1513
01:15:57,823 --> 01:15:58,591
I'm through protesting

1514
01:15:58,847 --> 01:16:00,639
The writing letters to your Congress people

1515
01:16:00,895 --> 01:16:01,663
Voting

1516
01:16:01,919 --> 01:16:02,943
All those sorts of things

1517
01:16:03,455 --> 01:16:04,223
Like those are

1518
01:16:04,479 --> 01:16:05,503
Legitimate things

1519
01:16:05,759 --> 01:16:07,295
You can do can push for reform

1520
01:16:07,807 --> 01:16:08,831
Those things you're not

1521
01:16:09,087 --> 01:16:10,111
Like we are not

1522
01:16:11,135 --> 01:16:14,207
Alex Jones's rule according to a lot of his critics

1523
01:16:14,463 --> 01:16:15,231
Rennline

1524
01:16:15,487 --> 01:16:16,511
Is Vicki

1525
01:16:16,767 --> 01:16:17,279
Is there too

1526
01:16:17,535 --> 01:16:21,119
To train you to think you don't have anything you can do

1527
01:16:23,167 --> 01:16:23,935
Craned

1528
01:16:24,191 --> 01:16:25,215
Listener

1529
01:16:25,727 --> 01:16:30,079
Alex Jones its bills in his audience even as I was talking

1530
01:16:32,895 --> 01:16:33,407
Support him

1531
01:16:33,663 --> 01:16:34,431
The third thing

1532
01:16:34,687 --> 01:16:37,503
Half minute clip of Taj Plumlee

1533
01:16:38,015 --> 01:16:39,807
That is also one of the big

1534
01:16:41,343 --> 01:16:43,135
Fingers that gets pointed it out

1535
01:16:43,391 --> 01:16:44,159
Is that he is a

1536
01:16:44,415 --> 01:16:44,927
GateKeeper

1537
01:16:45,439 --> 01:16:46,719
And the key is in place

1538
01:16:46,975 --> 01:16:50,047
So there is a flow of information the correct way

1539
01:16:50,559 --> 01:16:52,095
I don't necessarily believe this

1540
01:16:52,351 --> 01:16:56,959
Because that implies that the globalists are real and that but that criticism that comes to him

1541
01:16:57,215 --> 01:16:59,263
From these internet commenters

1542
01:16:59,519 --> 01:17:01,055
Is that the global still real

1543
01:17:01,311 --> 01:17:07,199
And Alex is a limited hangout you controlled opposition with

1544
01:17:07,455 --> 01:17:08,735
Stratton order to make sure the

1545
01:17:08,991 --> 01:17:09,759
You stay

1546
01:17:10,015 --> 01:17:11,295
Suckling off his teeth

1547
01:17:11,807 --> 01:17:17,439
As opposed to the real truth tellers in the world

1548
01:17:18,719 --> 01:17:21,023
Out

1549
01:17:25,375 --> 01:17:26,655
But there is it

1550
01:17:27,935 --> 01:17:31,263
I would say he likes me is amazing that there's three of the

1551
01:17:31,519 --> 01:17:33,055
Biggest criticisms

1552
01:17:33,311 --> 01:17:34,847
Text within one minute and a half

1553
01:17:35,103 --> 01:17:38,687
Of them talking I know you are but what am I

1554
01:17:38,943 --> 01:17:43,551
Like you're not like what they're doing is just accusing the opposition of what it is

1555
01:17:43,807 --> 01:17:45,087
Whatever it is they think they're due

1556
01:17:46,623 --> 01:17:49,695
Either they're silly

1557
01:17:49,951 --> 01:17:52,511
It's a little different than the general

1558
01:17:53,791 --> 01:17:55,327
Coming from Tosh Plumlee .0

1559
01:17:55,583 --> 01:17:56,863
No.

1560
01:17:57,119 --> 01:17:57,887
Yeah

1561
01:17:58,143 --> 01:18:00,447
It is a little bit different

1562
01:18:01,471 --> 01:18:02,751
I give it

1563
01:18:04,031 --> 01:18:06,847
I give it a little bit more of a pause to be like why is he

1564
01:18:07,103 --> 01:18:07,871
He saying those things

1565
01:18:08,127 --> 01:18:08,895
Alex

1566
01:18:09,151 --> 01:18:09,663
Pictures of course

1567
01:18:09,919 --> 01:18:11,711
I'm rubber you're glue

1568
01:18:14,527 --> 01:18:16,063
Stuff like that

1569
01:18:16,575 --> 01:18:19,391
There's probably an intention behind it and it's not just

1570
01:18:19,647 --> 01:18:20,159
Deflecting

1571
01:18:20,415 --> 01:18:22,719
She didn't have to do that right he has no

1572
01:18:22,975 --> 01:18:23,743
Skin in the game

1573
01:18:23,999 --> 01:18:25,791
Necessarily

1574
01:18:26,047 --> 01:18:28,607
You hit the nail right on the head Alex and then take something

1575
01:18:28,863 --> 01:18:30,143
Completely different

1576
01:18:31,167 --> 01:18:34,239
Here's a little bit of a commercial that I really enjoyed

1577
01:18:34,495 --> 01:18:36,543
Alex that does for his product

1578
01:18:36,799 --> 01:18:37,567
DNA Force

1579
01:18:37,823 --> 01:18:43,711
Great don't know add pivot to speak out on this but man this is a great commercial

1580
01:18:44,479 --> 01:18:45,759
Chester biopqq

1581
01:18:46,527 --> 01:18:47,807
Is 12 to 14,000

1582
01:18:49,343 --> 01:18:50,623
From

1583
01:18:52,159 --> 01:18:54,975
It's

1584
01:18:59,071 --> 01:19:01,119
Forced hardcore

1585
01:19:01,375 --> 01:19:02,911
Just to buy a Pikachu

1586
01:19:03,935 --> 01:19:06,239
Has equivalent vitamin C delivery in the body

1587
01:19:08,799 --> 01:19:09,311
Read the science

1588
01:19:11,871 --> 01:19:12,639
A blueberry

1589
01:19:13,663 --> 01:19:17,759
You can't text

1590
01:19:20,575 --> 01:19:22,367
BBQ1 pill

1591
01:19:24,415 --> 01:19:25,439
100

1592
01:19:26,207 --> 01:19:27,231
Pounds of blueberries

1593
01:19:33,119 --> 01:19:38,239
Blueberries

1594
01:19:40,287 --> 01:19:41,311
Thanks Fast Track

1595
01:19:52,063 --> 01:19:54,111

1596
01:19:56,927 --> 01:19:59,231
All blueberry

1597
01:19:59,487 --> 01:20:00,511
For something like this

1598
01:20:02,303 --> 01:20:04,095
Biglots.com

1599
01:20:04,351 --> 01:20:06,143
I thought a cop herbal product for $50

1600
01:20:09,215 --> 01:20:13,311
Do you know what's the best infomercial

1601
01:20:15,616 --> 01:20:17,408
As Seen On TV products

1602
01:20:17,664 --> 01:20:19,456
This is the perfect time to be like

1603
01:20:19,968 --> 01:20:21,760
Have you ever been eating 300 lb

1604
01:20:22,016 --> 01:20:23,552
Blueberries

1605
01:20:23,808 --> 01:20:28,672
Mouth is blue and there's a show like Abby roll from

1606
01:20:28,928 --> 01:20:31,488
From Wonka

1607
01:20:34,816 --> 01:20:39,680
Flipping how many times have the situation

1608
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:47,616
I was looking into this I don't care about the blueberry situation

1609
01:20:48,640 --> 01:20:50,432
Find myself

1610
01:20:50,688 --> 01:20:51,200
All the time

1611
01:20:52,736 --> 01:20:54,784
Do you mean the band The blueberries

1612
01:20:56,832 --> 01:20:58,112
Canterbury

1613
01:20:58,368 --> 01:21:03,232
The difference

1614
01:21:03,488 --> 01:21:04,256
Between Alex

1615
01:21:04,512 --> 01:21:06,048
Whose product other products

1616
01:21:06,816 --> 01:21:08,608
Is indeed

1617
01:21:11,168 --> 01:21:12,960
Snow the nutrition information

1618
01:21:14,240 --> 01:21:15,776
What you find is

1619
01:21:16,544 --> 01:21:17,568
Alex Jones

1620
01:21:19,360 --> 01:21:19,872
The bottle

1621
01:21:20,128 --> 01:21:21,664
Proprietary blend

1622
01:21:22,176 --> 01:21:25,504
And then whatever

1623
01:21:27,040 --> 01:21:32,928
The proprietary blend all blend the ingredients

1624
01:21:33,184 --> 01:21:34,720
He doesn't give you an actual idea

1625
01:21:34,976 --> 01:21:41,120
Percentage product on like some other that

1626
01:21:41,376 --> 01:21:43,424
Another company

1627
01:21:43,680 --> 01:21:47,008
I'll give you all the extra how much

1628
01:21:47,520 --> 01:21:50,592
Did he say it cost $14,000 a kilo or whatever

1629
01:21:50,848 --> 01:21:51,872
And that could be enough to

1630
01:21:52,128 --> 01:21:53,408
Goat 6 years

1631
01:21:54,688 --> 01:21:55,968
Or something like that

1632
01:21:56,224 --> 01:21:56,736
Hold on once

1633
01:21:59,552 --> 01:22:01,856
Percent of your daily allotted vitamin

1634
01:22:02,112 --> 01:22:02,880
I'm seeing this right

1635
01:22:03,136 --> 01:22:04,928
How many pounds of blueberries

1636
01:22:07,232 --> 01:22:13,120
Pounds of blueberries it's absorbed the same but different

1637
01:22:13,888 --> 01:22:14,400
Nothing

1638
01:22:14,656 --> 01:22:15,680
So in the next

1639
01:22:16,192 --> 01:22:19,520
Alex Jones has another weirdo cast a guy by the name of

1640
01:22:22,080 --> 01:22:27,200
Hate this guy get off this blueberries to measure everything in pounds of blueberries

1641
01:22:29,504 --> 01:22:31,040
How much in a bowl of soup

1642
01:22:31,296 --> 01:22:31,808
Cereal

1643
01:22:32,320 --> 01:22:33,088
How many pound

1644
01:22:33,344 --> 01:22:34,112
Songs of blueberries

1645
01:22:37,696 --> 01:22:38,464
Honey Bunches of Oats

1646
01:22:38,720 --> 01:22:44,864
Blueberries blue-berries blueberries

1647
01:22:45,120 --> 01:22:47,168
Blueberry

1648
01:22:51,520 --> 01:22:52,800
Joel skousen comes on

1649
01:22:56,640 --> 01:22:59,456
I don't want talk about his history or anything like that cuz

1650
01:22:59,968 --> 01:23:01,504
Take him down

1651
01:23:01,760 --> 01:23:05,344
I'm going to take him down a little bit later in a much more thorough but

1652
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:06,112
If it's clipped

1653
01:23:06,368 --> 01:23:10,208
He basically just rewrites what happened with the shooting of LaVoy finicum

1654
01:23:10,464 --> 01:23:11,488
Gibson

1655
01:23:11,744 --> 01:23:13,024
A real generous take

1656
01:23:13,536 --> 01:23:14,304
I wonder why

1657
01:23:16,352 --> 01:23:20,448
Very mild-mannered grandfather

1658
01:23:20,704 --> 01:23:22,496
A Mormon

1659
01:23:23,008 --> 01:23:26,080
To already well-spoken grandfatherly type

1660
01:23:26,336 --> 01:23:27,616
Why are Mormons

1661
01:23:27,872 --> 01:23:28,384
Good man

1662
01:23:28,896 --> 01:23:30,432
Religious man

1663
01:23:30,944 --> 01:23:36,064
She's the one that got shot I'm in the sky

1664
01:23:36,576 --> 01:23:40,160
He was not about what happened when he got out of

1665
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:46,048
Shut up

1666
01:23:46,304 --> 01:23:47,584
One of the witnesses

1667
01:23:47,840 --> 01:23:50,400
I'm talking to Bundy's bodyguard said that he rushed

1668
01:23:57,312 --> 01:23:58,592
Yeah walking forward to them

1669
01:23:59,360 --> 01:24:01,664
Basically bearing is Chester them with his hands

1670
01:24:03,456 --> 01:24:04,480
Application for the police

1671
01:24:12,160 --> 01:24:12,672
So

1672
01:24:12,928 --> 01:24:15,744
Beyond let's let's pretend he wasn't.

1673
01:24:17,792 --> 01:24:18,304
Which is not true

1674
01:24:18,560 --> 01:24:20,096
Admittedly

1675
01:24:20,352 --> 01:24:22,144
Bundy's bodyguards

1676
01:24:22,400 --> 01:24:24,192
He was angry and you rushed the cops

1677
01:24:24,448 --> 01:24:26,752
With no information at all

1678
01:24:27,008 --> 01:24:27,776
I don't think that's

1679
01:24:28,032 --> 01:24:30,336
Let's Pretend he wasn't armed

1680
01:24:31,360 --> 01:24:32,128
Situation is right

1681
01:24:32,896 --> 01:24:34,688
Now let's imagine the situation

1682
01:24:34,944 --> 01:24:41,088
Kitchenware

1683
01:24:41,344 --> 01:24:42,368
Joel skousen

1684
01:24:42,624 --> 01:24:43,136
Songs words

1685
01:24:43,392 --> 01:24:48,256
But he he was fed up and he said shoot me any police bearing his chest

1686
01:24:48,512 --> 01:24:51,584
And they told him to stop walking and he kept walking towards them

1687
01:24:52,096 --> 01:24:54,656
David there's no way I was Jones would ever give

1688
01:24:55,168 --> 01:24:56,448
Any kind of a path

1689
01:25:00,544 --> 01:25:04,384
I think

1690
01:25:05,664 --> 01:25:07,200
I don't think that's

1691
01:25:12,832 --> 01:25:14,112
Who were there

1692
01:25:14,624 --> 01:25:15,904
Reported what happened

1693
01:25:18,720 --> 01:25:24,864
Cool

1694
01:25:26,144 --> 01:25:29,984
The other one was in his pocket reaching for

1695
01:25:30,496 --> 01:25:31,264
That's true

1696
01:25:32,544 --> 01:25:35,872
I think if you're a grandfatherly type well-spoken

1697
01:25:36,128 --> 01:25:36,640
Guy

1698
01:25:38,944 --> 01:25:39,968
Pull a pistol on the cob

1699
01:25:43,040 --> 01:25:44,064
Grandfatherly

1700

1702
01:25:46,624 --> 01:25:49,952

1703
01:25:50,208 --> 01:25:50,976
Government money

1704
01:25:51,232 --> 01:25:53,024
Do not grow things online

1705
01:25:53,280 --> 01:25:59,424
And then get $100,000 a year from a charity to have a bunch of foster kids

1706
01:25:59,680 --> 01:26:00,192
Children

1707
01:26:00,448 --> 01:26:00,960
It's crazy

1708
01:26:03,264 --> 01:26:04,800
And this is where Alex Jones

1709
01:26:06,336 --> 01:26:08,128
I wanted to leave this episode

1710
01:26:08,384 --> 01:26:11,200
Because it's been a little bit heavy on me

1711
01:26:11,456 --> 01:26:14,016
Poking bathroom holes in his historical beliefs

1712
01:26:14,272 --> 01:26:15,040
Right

1713
01:26:15,296 --> 01:26:19,904
And I wanted to leave with a good example of how he covers news

1714
01:26:20,672 --> 01:26:22,208
Little clips

1715
01:26:22,464 --> 01:26:24,000
From time to time with him

1716
01:26:24,256 --> 01:26:26,304
ESAT News what you should have said was

1717
01:26:27,328 --> 01:26:28,608

01:27:00,352 --> 01:27:04,704
The strategy of repetition with no analysis

1729
01:27:04,960 --> 01:27:10,848
No discussion of whether or not these things I'm saying or these things are

1730
01:27:11,104 --> 01:27:12,896
Just repetition to you believe it

1731
01:27:13,920 --> 01:27:14,432
Into your head

1732
01:27:15,456 --> 01:27:15,968
Be afraid

1733
01:27:16,224 --> 01:27:18,272
Putting acid in the water attract bears

1734
01:27:19,552 --> 01:27:20,064
Babies

1735
01:27:20,576 --> 01:27:22,624

01:28:18,688 --> 01:28:20,992
Bad example

1745
01:28:22,016 --> 01:28:24,064
I looked up what Lena Dunham said and I should

Fake glasses

1755
01:29:20,640 --> 01:29:26,784
He delivered that line right there as if it's an old-time catchphrase

1756
01:29:27,040 --> 01:29:31,136
Call and response on his farewell tour

Vista

1766
01:30:01,600 --> 01:30:02,624
Like a formality

1767
01:30:02,880 --> 01:30:03,648
Just write something

1768
01:30:03,904 --> 01:30:08,768
If you write an essay that would scare you 300 on the written sat

1769
01:30:09,536 --> 01:30:10,048
Will give you a

1770
01:30:10,304 --> 01:30:13,120
If you could avoid saying I wanted done kill somebody

1771
01:30:13,376 --> 01:30:14,656
Then you get a gun

1772
01:30:20,288 --> 01:30:26,432
As a carcinogen because studies came out the show The Kitchen

1773
01:30:27,968 --> 01:30:29,760

Fluoride

1779
01:30:50,496 --> 01:30:52,800
Wanted to just remind everybody

1780
01:30:53,056 --> 01:30:54,592
One more time today

1781
01:30:55,104 --> 01:30:56,384
Special

1782
01:30:56,640 --> 01:30:58,688
That was lame saw that coming

1783
01:30:59,200 --> 01:31:01,504
Yeah of course it was

1784
01:31:01,760 --> 01:31:04,832
Still happened

1785
01:31:05,088 --> 01:31:06,624

1786
01:31:06,880 --> 01:31:08,928

01:31:09,184 --> 01:31:10,464
Blueberry

1788
01:31:10,720 --> 01:31:11,488
Rosicrucian cult

1789
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:15,840
Dude it's like I know a little bit about the rosicrucians

1790
01:31:16,096 --> 01:31:18,144
Things that I think

1791
01:31:18,400 --> 01:31:20,960
I think that in terms of what we talked about

1792
01:31:21,216 --> 01:31:24,800
Christianity or the lack thereof

1793
01:31:25,056 --> 01:31:28,128
I think that I have been too focused on straight-up gnosticism

1794
01:31:28,640 --> 01:31:31,456
I think it's some of those ideas about living on through

1795
01:31:31,712 --> 01:31:32,224
Are your children

1796
01:31:32,480 --> 01:31:33,760
Might come from rosicrucian

1797
01:31:34,528 --> 01:31:36,576
Cuz they're big into reincarnation and Perfection of the

1798
01:31:36,832 --> 01:31:38,112
The soul through repetition

1799
01:31:38,368 --> 01:31:39,136
And stuff like that

1800
01:31:39,392 --> 01:31:41,184
So I think I think that might be

1801
01:31:43,488 --> 01:31:45,024
Subscribe not only to

1802
01:31:46,816 --> 01:31:49,888
About history he might also have like rosicrucian Christian

1803
01:31:51,680 --> 01:31:55,008
As well the rosicrucians

1804
01:31:55,264 --> 01:31:57,056
Then quite frankly Alex is dumb

1805
01:31:57,312 --> 01:32:02,432
Those two are not mutually exclusive Alex is dumb so it becomes dumb

1806
01:32:02,688 --> 01:32:04,992
We're in the interesting becomes

1807
01:32:05,248 --> 01:32:05,760
Stupid

1808
01:32:07,552 --> 01:32:10,880

1812
01:32:27,776 --> 01:32:29,312
Rest in peace LaVoy finicum

1813
01:32:29,568 --> 01:32:32,640
It is sad that anybody had to die but at the same time

1814
01:32:34,432 --> 01:32:35,456
I feel bad for the 15

1815
01:32:35,712 --> 01:32:36,224

From the government according to the site I saw earlier today

1819
01:32:54,144 --> 01:32:57,984
Out of context drop

1820
01:32:58,240 --> 01:33:01,568
Which is just as fun afterward that it was it would have been before

1821
01:33:13,344 --> 01:33:19,488
Okay I thought you was being sarcastic

1822
01:33:19,744 --> 01:33:20,768
Said he turns into the

1823
01:33:21,280 --> 01:33:23,584

1824
01:33:23,840 --> 01:33:24,352
