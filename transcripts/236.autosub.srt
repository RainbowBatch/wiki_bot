Alexandra Thurston color

00:00:14,336 --> 00:00:18,176
Alex Jones

3
00:00:18,432 --> 00:00:18,944
Which present

4
00:00:19,968 --> 00:00:20,480
Which was never born

5
00:00:26,368 --> 00:00:28,672
Pickle Barrel

6
00:00:32,512 --> 00:00:36,352
I don't see here's the issue Atlantic would run the s*** out of that thing

7
00:00:36,608 --> 00:00:37,376
Welcome

8
00:00:37,632 --> 00:00:38,144
The computer this

9
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:43,520
How many presidents were individualistic acting presidents and how many

10
00:00:44,032 --> 00:00:47,872
We're mirror people in this way

11
00:00:48,896 --> 00:00:52,224
I've done all the evils

12
00:00:54,784 --> 00:01:00,928
It wouldn't have worked out the exact this point might have happened I'm sure we wouldn't have treated me

13
00:01:01,184 --> 00:01:04,512
Americans well if Christine had

14
00:01:05,024 --> 00:01:07,584
Reject your question

15
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,144
Because

16
00:01:10,656 --> 00:01:11,936
12

17
00:01:13,472 --> 00:01:18,592
My reasoning is that the choose one individual would to beat the giant

18
00:01:18,848 --> 00:01:22,176
Strongman theory of history and I don't want to do that

19
00:01:22,432 --> 00:01:28,320
I'm hiding behind that is

20
00:01:28,576 --> 00:01:30,624
Cowardly

21
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,672
Appropriate

22
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:35,488
I asked you in the middle of taking a drink

23
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:42,144
Something about a president

24
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:42,912
At the same time

25
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:49,312
You don't know doesn't just one

26
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:52,384
Did we get rid of

27
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,152
Exact

28
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:02,112
I guess if you're going to go that way

29
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:10,560
I will accept your answer where I do love you know a lot of

30
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:16,448
About how

31
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:24,640
I'm so Jordan today what we got in front of us is a modern-day

32
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:31,040
There's too much going on with Infowars world in the in the broader news Arena

33
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:37,440
What's going on with Alex and his dumb friend

34
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:41,024
Against

35
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:45,376
And it's goofy

36
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:52,288
Doesn't come up at all in Alex's advertising

37
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:58,688
And he's not going to give any information

38
00:02:58,944 --> 00:02:59,968
Desiccation

39
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:00,736
Delight

40
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:04,576
How much of a monster he is it a come at me bro

41
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:10,976
Hey man further we had the memo came out about Flynn's cooperation Which flies barely

42
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:17,376
The counter through lot of the things I said about playing in the past

43
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:18,400
Down to it

44
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:22,496
Find out what Alex is talking about a surprise to find out

45
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:23,776
It was none of that

46
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:33,760
Created

47
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:40,160
Georgia

48
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:51,936
Well-known Chinese actress in the world just disappeared for 4 months of course

49
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:56,800
The guy who created cooking up front

50
00:03:57,312 --> 00:04:01,408
This prediction Jordan has ever made on this

51
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:04,992
Note 3 doesn't come back up

52
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:06,528
Crazy.

53
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:08,832
Really interesting

54
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:11,392
We're going to be downright very

55
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:13,952
Do you know it's not down right now that way

56
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:20,607

Thank you very much

60
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:41,343
I'm a policy wonk

61
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:53,119
Make sense

62
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:55,423
Quite frankly whenever someone donates

63
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:56,703
Like you're more than

64
00:04:57,215 --> 00:05:03,359
Just a little however it is George Soros Junior

65
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:06,687
You are now a technocrat

66
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:13,087
Someone sodomites Italy a bucket of poop

67
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:25,375

Thank you so much storage Junior

69
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:41,503
Remember that

70
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:49,439
That's like that

71
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:52,255
That they were all ashamed for being deformed

72
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:53,535
Inform

73
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:55,327
Hit him away and

74
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:59,935
That's not the situation with George Soros

75
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:06,335
Do you like George Soros Junior at sports show you can do that

76
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:11,199
Appreciate

77
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:15,039
Episode

00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:17,087
Like it show sucks

79
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:21,695
Right now at the present day is going to be good opportunities

80
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:22,463
Clowning

81
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:27,327
What I mean

82
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:34,495
The Mind reels

83
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:36,287
Why was the first

84
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:37,823
That is a legitimate

85
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:48,063
Clearly

86
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:53,695
He's doing something off colors

87
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:58,815
December 4th and 5th episodes

Of this week

92
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:09,055
The fourth is not all that great

93
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:10,591
I'll be I'll be up front

94
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:12,127
Not that great

95
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:17,759
Are you telling us that you listen to an entire Alex Jones Show and decided that

96
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:24,415
Present-day it wasn't that great it does that's crazy

97
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:27,743
Yeah but there are a couple things that are worthwhile

98
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:29,023
And

99
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:30,815
Is that when he's coming back from break

100
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:31,839
In the middle of the show

101
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:38,495
Alex breaks out of song parody

102
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:51,295
Republican

103
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:10,495
I'll take the rest of your freedom that's right it doesn't run

104
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:16,895
The Wrong lyrics

105
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:24,575
Not

106
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:25,855
I have the lyrics

107
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:32,255
And it's funny cuz Rodger is on the show at this point

108
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:37,887
Rodger I'm about to be indicted by the f****** government for treason Stone

109
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:40,959
Farewell Alex Jones

110
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:44,287
Bulshit / Albert Against the Wind

111
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:50,687
That's the speaker version

112
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:57,087
4 Highway

113
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:08,607
Wait

114
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:10,143
No it's not

115
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:11,423
Brown

116
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:15,519
Who did the original against the Win Brown

117
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:18,591
He's a doctor my eyes

118
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:19,871
What song

119
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:22,687
Anyways

120
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:26,015
That's a new one

121
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:30,623
Going to bother me I might end up looking it up in the middle of the show

122
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:35,743
Let's see how long before it eats away your soul enough

123
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:37,535
You're actually doing it right now

124
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:39,839
The moment I started talking you were like

125
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:46,239
I bet f****** look it up.

126
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:54,687
This is why

127
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:57,503
Sometimes. It's like my doctor Wyrick

128
00:09:57,759 --> 00:09:58,527
My logic

129
00:09:58,783 --> 00:10:00,063
Professor College

130
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:02,367
One time you said his name like I should

131
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:08,511
You Should Know Who You Are

132
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:10,047
Had a great

133
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:11,327
Assertive laid-back Style

134
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:12,607
Junior's real nerdy

135
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:13,375
Awesome

136
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:18,239
Maybe he had some problems in class in like breakdown

137
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:21,311
Spell questions about 1

138
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:22,335
And one

139
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:25,663
Student in the class fellow student was like

140
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:28,223
My intuition says

141
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:30,271
This argument is valid but I don't

142
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:31,039
Think it is

143
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:35,135
Reservoir

144
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:38,975
Breaks it down exhausted like explanation why

145
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:40,511
The argument is valid mean

146
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:41,791
Interested

147
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:44,863
This is proof of why sometimes

148
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:46,911
You shouldn't just trust your intuition

149
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:52,543
That's exactly what I felt there with the Seeker

150
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:56,639
Anyway is like nothing at all

151
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:58,943
Obviously if you're saying well

152
00:10:59,199 --> 00:11:01,759
This proves that sometimes

153
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:04,319
That implies that sometimes you should

154
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:06,879
And it doesn't give you any contacts

155
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:09,439
Sometimes

156
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:18,911
Anyway the sexiest of all the place

157
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:22,751
That'll be my autobiography

158
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:29,919
Your return to Stand-Up is going to be pure character diagram except

159
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:35,039
Alex

160
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:38,367
About Alex

161
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:39,135
And his plan

162
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:40,927
And then Alex

163
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:41,695
Pretend

164
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:46,559
They aren't into what Rodger saying isn't true for no reason

165
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:47,839
This is super weird

166
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:48,607
Real quick

167
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:50,655
Before we go any further

168
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:52,959
Complicated convoluted

169
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:55,519
All I want to know because I can't see the video

170
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:56,287
In any way

171
00:11:57,567 --> 00:12:02,431
Does Rodger carry a bug out bag with him at all times I only listen to the audio

172
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:08,319
Carrying a bag full of men

173
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:11,647
Concurrency

174
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:15,487
And like a disc

175
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:17,791
B like that

176
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:24,447
Glasses and big nose and mustache a school bus sized vaporizer

177
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:30,847
Hide your gun

178
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:33,919
All these things can be bought through AT&T

179
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:40,575
He needs to know where to put your guns on your body to avoid them being found in the book just about

180
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:42,111
Derringers

181
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:49,791
Conversation about their plans I don't know why Alex is being like

182
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:59,007
Very forcefully to the president's attention

183
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:13,599
Warmer climate between the holidays

184
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:22,559
Frosted do some things to draw

185
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:30,495
Simpsons president faces

186
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:35,103
This is why I

187
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:54,047
Yeah oh yeah

188
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:56,607
You're not coming I get it

189
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:09,919
Tell your mother you're brilliant

190
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:16,319
You're not going ever realize that you realized

191
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:19,135
Everyone is looking at me

192
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:25,791
You're going to come down to Florida with me started Mar-A-Lago

193
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:28,607
That's what I hear.

194
00:14:28,863 --> 00:14:31,935
Look for the next couple weeks

195
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:34,751
I don't f****** know

196
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:36,543
Almost almost assuredly

197
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:39,359
I love Alex

198
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:45,759
She's being Coy I can't tell if that's what he's doing or if you think

199
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:49,343
What the intention is that clip

200
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:50,367
0

201
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:53,951
Important to recognize

202
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:55,487
Early in the week

203
00:14:55,999 --> 00:15:00,863
There was Trump tweeted about Rodger Stone not being weak

204
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:03,423
Scared

205
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:04,191
Can we

206
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:05,215
Hold on real quick

207
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:07,007
Trump committed a crime

208
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:08,543
And there you go

209
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:14,943
A lot of people a lot of people have

210
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:21,087
Buckedup

211
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:22,623
Weird certainly

212
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:25,695
Xol disappearance doesn't have the

213
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:26,719
Stories about

214
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:28,511
Pleading the fifth or Flynn

215
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:29,535
Stuff to talk about

216
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:31,583
The only thing he responds to is like

217
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:35,935
It's not that not all that in

218
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:38,751
They have a narrative

219
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:39,519
Is that they want to

220
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:40,287
To spend most

221
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:41,055
Cast of their time off

222
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:43,871
And that is the passing of the USM

223
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:44,639
MCA

224
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:46,943
Which is the authority

225
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:48,223
No

226
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:48,991
Your

227
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:52,575
USM usmca why do I doubt you are

228
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:55,647
You are going to work on yourself

229
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:58,207
Bright but I forgot that stands for agreement

230
00:15:58,463 --> 00:15:58,975
Confidence

231
00:15:59,231 --> 00:16:01,023
U.s. Mexico Canada green

232
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:03,583
Reimagining

233
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:10,239
It's not fun to stay at the usmca

234
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:12,799
Because

235
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:13,823
Destroyed

236
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:14,591
Free speech

237
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:16,895
The world

238
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:19,455
I really don't think that's how that works

239
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:21,247
Placated what he's talking about

240
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:22,015
Why he has

241
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:22,783
Because ideas

242
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:24,063
But it

243
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:25,087
Because you make

244
00:16:25,343 --> 00:16:26,367
Declaration about what

245
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:27,903
If

246
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:29,183
That gets ratified

247
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:31,999
English

248
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:43,007
Without liability

249
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:55,295
That's

250
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:19,359
It is my Rubicon River

251
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:23,967
Ratified by the republican-controlled Senate

252
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:28,063
If Trump does not act against this

253
00:17:28,575 --> 00:17:31,647
Then it means that he is capitulate

254
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:36,255
America failed

255
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:42,143
You're not allowed to just shine over our first amendment

256
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:44,191
You're not allowed to do all this

257
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:46,495
Remember Alex Jones is above

258
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:47,775
The right left

259
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:54,943
Destroy America

260
00:17:55,199 --> 00:18:01,343
I mean obviously the Dems are the ones who allows this usmca to be

261
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:03,135
Ratified then

262
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:04,159
Is Line in the Sand

263
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:06,975
And he must go against Trump

264
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:07,743
Capitulate

265
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:09,535
The wolf

266
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:16,191
Yeah good luck. 17 is a little bit murky

267
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:16,959
Agree with him

268
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:17,727
Tiny bit

269
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:20,799
If only because they need to specify the language

270
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:25,663
The idea of objectionable content

271
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:27,455
And stuff like that it does

272
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:29,247
Could be interpreted little bit

273
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:30,015
It broadly

274
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:31,807
And that

275
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:33,599
Diminish

276
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:34,367
Free speech

277
00:18:34,623 --> 00:18:36,927
I think you're being a little bit like exaggerating

278
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:39,487
But he has a kernel of something that I

279
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:40,767
I kind of agree with

280
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:47,167
Whenever whenever he starts talking about the first thing I think of it is used

281
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:48,703
Idiotic

282
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:49,983
I like

283
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:51,775
Copyright

284
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:53,311
Bulshit that they're trying to

285
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:56,895
Put on the internet where it's like I get your idea

286
00:18:57,151 --> 00:18:59,455
I totally agree that something needs to

287
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:00,223
Be done

288
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:02,527
But this was written by old white dude

289
00:19:02,783 --> 00:19:05,087
Don't understand the internet at all

290
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:06,879
And it's going to be a disaster if

291
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:07,647
You trying

292
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:09,439
Reply this

293
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:10,207
To the internet

294
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:20,703
I think you're

295
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:22,495
But you're not smart enough

296
00:19:22,751 --> 00:19:24,287
To handle the internet

297
00:19:25,823 --> 00:19:27,359
Possibly sensible ideas

298
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:28,383
Reply to broadly

Dangerous Waters

301
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:37,087
Specific it's like it's like right

302
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:44,511
Yeah yeah

303
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:46,303
Him in as much as

304
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:48,095
As it goes towards red

305
00:19:48,351 --> 00:19:48,863
Application

306
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:49,887
Leisure

307
00:19:50,143 --> 00:19:53,215
Flush out the language a little bit

308
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:54,239
Is any problem

309
00:19:54,495 --> 00:19:56,543
But even if it's past as it is I don't think

310
00:19:57,055 --> 00:19:58,079
Necessarily

311
00:19:58,335 --> 00:19:58,847
Problem

312
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:03,711
Anyway

313
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:06,015
What else

314
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:06,783
Kicked off

315
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:11,135
Kicked off Twitter Facebook YouTube

316
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:13,439
Dorsum articles

317
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:15,743
It went around about how Alex

318
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:17,023
Got kicked off and

319
00:20:17,535 --> 00:20:18,303
Have you had no audience

320
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:19,071
Everybody

321
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:21,375
Any response Alex's

322
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:23,679
Railed about how he's doing better than ever

323
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:29,055
More listeners

324
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:30,335
Which is interesting

325
00:20:30,591 --> 00:20:31,871
Because on the 4th he says this

326
00:20:32,895 --> 00:20:35,711
Got to go

327
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:37,247
We are going to deliver

328
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:47,743
Thousand

329
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:50,303
If you can write in your own letter

330
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:52,095
You can print it off and mail it

331
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:53,119
He's only gotten

332
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:54,911
50,000 signatures

333
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:55,935
On his

334
00:20:56,703 --> 00:21:02,079
Tell Trump that he needs to protect Free Speech or else America is over campaign

335
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:03,359
That's because

336
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:10,271
So many people visited the website

337
00:21:11,551 --> 00:21:12,063
This is

338
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:12,831
Toughman

339
00:21:13,087 --> 00:21:14,623
Isn't

340
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:16,672
Anything--for somebody with an operation

341
00:21:17,184 --> 00:21:20,000
You would hope it's not like he just launched

342
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:22,560
That that

343
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:30,240
That's not good might be as many listeners is Alex has

344
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:32,288
That's true but he can't Direct

345
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:35,360
To a place where all you do is find something

346
00:21:35,616 --> 00:21:41,760
Electronically and then he said

347
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:48,160
There's no hurdle in order.

348
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:50,720
I'm not

349
00:21:51,488 --> 00:21:52,256
Does not compute

350
00:21:52,768 --> 00:21:57,632
I know that that's not like a reliable barometer of

351
00:21:58,912 --> 00:22:00,448
That is not a good sign

352
00:22:02,496 --> 00:22:04,032
Sign that you should

353
00:22:04,288 --> 00:22:05,824
Start working on your overhead

354
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:09,152
And see whether or not there

355
00:22:09,408 --> 00:22:13,760
See if there's a non-essential employees like everyone

356
00:22:16,576 --> 00:22:17,344
The 4th

357
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:18,112
Alex

362

00:22:39,616 --> 00:22:42,176
Because you

367
00:22:49,344 --> 00:22:55,488
Because I'm a nice little engineer that

368
00:22:55,744 --> 00:22:58,816
Steve Jobs dead

369
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,216
Don't believe me

Great vocals on the ones in absolutely

376
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:53,344
Throws a few bars down

377
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:54,368
Everybody's happy

00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:58,208
Crazy

380
00:23:58,464 --> 00:24:04,608
Can't tell the story because it seems innocuous enough and it's a celebrity interaction no

381
00:24:04,864 --> 00:24:09,216
The Galaxy

382
00:24:09,472 --> 00:24:15,616
DJ cuz I think it interferes with his image of his family and all that stuff

383
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:17,408
That he's a house DJ

384
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:19,456
He has a SoundCloud under his own name

385
00:24:19,712 --> 00:24:20,480
Buckley Hammond

386
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:23,040
Picture of him on there

387
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:24,064
I mean

388
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,880
I don't I don't think I don't think it's any secret that Buckley

389
00:24:28,928 --> 00:24:35,072
Maybe that he's related to Alex

390
00:24:35,328 --> 00:24:39,680
Probably Alex Jones is cuz you kind of have to know who he is or have read

391
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:40,704
Ashley Beckford

392
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:43,264
EEOC complaint where he's named

393
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,032
Lesbian

394
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:46,336
Director of

395
00:24:46,592 --> 00:24:50,176
I'm interested

396
00:24:50,432 --> 00:24:51,712
Is to be racist towards

397
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:53,504
Distinct groups

398
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:56,832
Two people

399
00:24:57,344 --> 00:25:00,416
Cuz it doesn't cuz the first time he said why

400
00:25:00,672 --> 00:25:01,440
Like what was

401
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,304
Was almost with an offense evasion axe

402
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:15,776
Super race

403
00:25:16,032 --> 00:25:16,800
It's not it's

404
00:25:22,176 --> 00:25:24,992
Cut out a bunch of him just doing Bernie Sanders

405
00:25:29,344 --> 00:25:29,856
Rambling about now

406
00:25:33,696 --> 00:25:35,232
And there's a

407
00:25:38,816 --> 00:25:39,328
Kissing stuff

408
00:25:39,584 --> 00:25:42,144
Alex starts off the show by saying

409
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,424
Come to a big

410
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,192
Realization

411
00:25:45,984 --> 00:25:47,264
And now here's report for job app

412
00:25:48,544 --> 00:25:49,568
I love it

413
00:25:52,896 --> 00:25:55,968
Got to fill that first 6 minutes write radio station

414
00:25:56,224 --> 00:25:57,248
Play John bowne report

415
00:25:57,504 --> 00:25:58,272
Goes to break

416
00:25:58,528 --> 00:25:59,040
And comes back

417
00:25:59,552 --> 00:26:00,832
Is the formal start of the show

418
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:07,744
It was the worst of times

419
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:19,264
Radical Islam

420
00:26:23,616 --> 00:26:27,456
Discovered

421
00:26:28,224 --> 00:26:29,248
The good news

422
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,552
That's the best of times

423
00:26:31,808 --> 00:26:32,320
Part of it

424
00:26:32,832 --> 00:26:33,344
Yeah

425
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:37,952
Realizes it's under attack

426
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:41,024
Nationalism is on the rise

427
00:26:42,048 --> 00:26:42,816
These look good

428
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:44,864
Always

429
00:26:45,632 --> 00:26:46,400
Thought it was under attack

430
00:26:52,032 --> 00:26:55,104
But it's weird

431
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,664
Thousands of years later we're still getting f*****

432
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:04,832
Call Vista

433
00:27:05,088 --> 00:27:06,112
Christianity realizes

434
00:27:06,368 --> 00:27:07,136
Time to punch back

435
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:13,280
Coming back up north for another Crusade

436
00:27:13,536 --> 00:27:14,304
Should I hear the bad news

437
00:27:18,656 --> 00:27:20,960
Incredible wealth incredible success

438
00:27:21,216 --> 00:27:23,520
Always breed

439
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:29,408
It breeds breeds spoiled rotten

440
00:27:29,664 --> 00:27:35,296
Gym cartel

441
00:27:35,552 --> 00:27:37,344
Porch in the power structure

442
00:27:38,624 --> 00:27:43,488
Systemically go out and hunt down every time

443
00:27:44,512 --> 00:27:45,280
They're better

444
00:27:51,168 --> 00:27:52,960
Strong always is

445
00:27:53,728 --> 00:27:59,872
You're talking about

446
00:28:00,128 --> 00:28:04,992
I just say you're talk about white people

447
00:28:06,016 --> 00:28:07,808
I never liked anybody talks about groups of

448
00:28:08,064 --> 00:28:09,088
People recognizing their

449
00:28:09,344 --> 00:28:10,880
Are batteries and stuff like that

450
00:28:11,136 --> 00:28:14,976
That just applied outside

451
00:28:15,488 --> 00:28:17,536
I don't I don't know

452
00:28:18,048 --> 00:28:19,584
Where else anyone

453
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,120
Sound mind

454
00:28:21,376 --> 00:28:23,168
Refers to a group as

455
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:24,192
Their lesser

456
00:28:28,544 --> 00:28:31,616
Not think to classify people

457
00:28:31,872 --> 00:28:32,640
Ilonggo store

458
00:28:32,896 --> 00:28:34,432
Supplies

459
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:36,992
No

460
00:28:37,248 --> 00:28:39,808
Greater and lesser Mages

461
00:28:43,648 --> 00:28:46,976
Alright alright

462
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:50,816
So we have here the good-news-bad-news

463
00:28:51,072 --> 00:28:52,096
The best of times worse

464
00:28:53,632 --> 00:28:55,424
We have somehow involved in Alex

465
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,704
Having a big revelation

466
00:28:57,472 --> 00:28:57,984
Do we have

467
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:00,032
Christianity fighting back

468
00:29:00,544 --> 00:29:02,080
Free market is on the rise

469
00:29:02,336 --> 00:29:03,104
Bad news

470
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:05,408
Making a lot of money

471
00:29:05,664 --> 00:29:06,688
Being really successful

472
00:29:06,944 --> 00:29:08,224
Read decadent

473
00:29:08,992 --> 00:29:10,272
And then these decadent types

474
00:29:10,528 --> 00:29:12,320
It's always hunt down there better

475
00:29:13,088 --> 00:29:14,624
So that's the good news bad news

476
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:20,000
It's unclear what he's talkin about right now

477
00:29:22,304 --> 00:29:26,144
I don't want to get into

478
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:33,056
2/2 of one side of a cube

479
00:29:33,568 --> 00:29:37,664
I think I did probably but there's somewhere he's going with this that is

480
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:38,432
Frazee

481
00:29:38,688 --> 00:29:42,528
And I also use the big reveal of what his Revelation is

482
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:46,880
Massively disappointing on the way there I had a

483
00:29:47,392 --> 00:29:48,416
Realization

484
00:29:48,672 --> 00:29:49,952
About what

485
00:29:50,208 --> 00:29:51,488
Spinning the narrative

486
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,792
Haunted on this episode on the 5th

487
00:29:54,048 --> 00:30:00,192
All right get to that blood

488
00:30:00,448 --> 00:30:03,776
Introduces the beginning of his

489
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,200
Disorganized

490
00:30:12,224 --> 00:30:13,504
Guiding Cent

491
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:17,600
Constellation

492
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:32,448
What they're doing

493
00:30:32,704 --> 00:30:35,264
Who that's interesting house he's going to come down

494
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:44,480
You don't hear any modern nomenclature

495
00:30:48,576 --> 00:30:51,136
It's obscene

496
00:30:58,304 --> 00:31:00,864
So we have a constellation is a news article

497
00:31:02,144 --> 00:31:05,728
You have to dig under the surface in order to understand the theme

498
00:31:05,984 --> 00:31:06,752
Which actually

499
00:31:07,264 --> 00:31:08,288
Is very similar to

500
00:31:08,544 --> 00:31:11,104
How Gerald Ford as described

501
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:12,384
These Trends forecasting

502
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:18,784
Strategy

503
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:22,880
Commonalities between the Articles

504
00:31:23,392 --> 00:31:24,160
They both

505
00:31:27,488 --> 00:31:29,792
I'm not sure

506
00:31:30,048 --> 00:31:31,072
We'll see how this plays out

507
00:31:31,584 --> 00:31:34,144
Is constellation a news article

508
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,424
Alex

509
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:37,728
As somebody who enjoys

510
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:40,032
Expend

511
00:31:40,288 --> 00:31:41,056
Many years

512
00:31:48,992 --> 00:31:49,760
Of course

513
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:55,136
Deserve to everybody publication magazine

514
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:57,952
There's a reason that we don't say

515
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:00,768
Has nothing to do with

516
00:32:01,024 --> 00:32:07,168
Mother the murder of crows proper term for a group

517
00:32:09,984 --> 00:32:13,056
I in my resume

518
00:32:18,432 --> 00:32:24,576
Metro

519
00:32:25,088 --> 00:32:25,600
Before I die

520
00:32:29,952 --> 00:32:36,096
One would hear

521
00:32:39,424 --> 00:32:45,568
So Alex brings in his first article and paste play a constellation of clips

522
00:32:47,104 --> 00:32:49,664
Article

523
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:51,200
And pay attention

524
00:32:51,712 --> 00:32:53,504
To when this article came out

525
00:32:59,136 --> 00:33:00,160
Cumberbatch from

526
00:33:00,928 --> 00:33:03,744
Last year this year they had big National studies and Pole

527
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:10,144
It's coming from over a year ago

528
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:12,192
This first article and his constellation

529
00:33:12,704 --> 00:33:14,496
He says they have a bunch of studies hold on

530
00:33:14,752 --> 00:33:18,080
Constellations

531
00:33:18,336 --> 00:33:24,480
Start a different distances so you know that Ryan is further away it's maybe a year

532
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:27,296
Year older than another spectator God Is A Thousand Years

533
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:33,440
University

534
00:33:34,464 --> 00:33:38,304
Majority of Millennials want to live in a socialist

535
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:43,424
At the University they're going to charge

536
00:33:43,936 --> 00:33:45,472
I think that might be a loaded question

537
00:33:46,496 --> 00:33:48,544
Shake that ass

538
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,848
There's a bunch of bunch

539
00:33:51,616 --> 00:33:54,176
Actually we say.

540
00:33:56,224 --> 00:33:58,272
44%

541
00:33:58,528 --> 00:34:00,320
Do they know what it means no

542
00:34:00,576 --> 00:34:03,136
Millennials

543
00:34:03,392 --> 00:34:04,160
Chill

544
00:34:08,768 --> 00:34:11,584
Set not with you

545
00:34:17,216 --> 00:34:19,520
So all of those headlines

546
00:34:19,776 --> 00:34:24,640
We're on Fox News

547
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:31,040
Bass Publications fair and balanced

548
00:34:31,296 --> 00:34:32,576
They're all articles

549
00:34:32,832 --> 00:34:34,880
This study

550
00:34:37,184 --> 00:34:39,232
A bunch of

551
00:34:40,512 --> 00:34:42,048
But instead they're just a bunch of

552
00:34:42,304 --> 00:34:43,072
Bunch of hacks

553
00:34:43,328 --> 00:34:44,352
Right-wing articles

554
00:34:45,376 --> 00:34:45,888
The same study

555
00:34:46,144 --> 00:34:52,288
Yep perception of like a year ago there were all of these studies

556
00:34:52,544 --> 00:34:53,568
Came out that were

557
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:56,384
They're all like kids all want

558
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:57,920
Communism

559
00:34:59,456 --> 00:35:01,504
Millennials you know how their what

560
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,040
30

561
00:35:03,296 --> 00:35:05,088
So I Googled the first

562
00:35:05,344 --> 00:35:08,672
Headlines

563
00:35:08,928 --> 00:35:10,208
Because it was the first one

564
00:35:11,744 --> 00:35:13,536
Washington time

565
00:35:13,792 --> 00:35:14,816
Horses owned by the moon

566
00:35:15,328 --> 00:35:17,120
The article is a write-up of

567
00:35:17,376 --> 00:35:20,192
Report on us attitudes towards social is

568
00:35:20,704 --> 00:35:24,544
Put out by the victims of Communism Memorial Foundation

569
00:35:25,568 --> 00:35:27,104
Report

570
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:29,664
2nd Annual

571
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:34,272
This isn't like something that's been going on since the seventies it every year we get like us

572
00:35:34,528 --> 00:35:40,672
How does America feel about socialism this year and information whatsoever

573
00:35:40,928 --> 00:35:47,072
I couldn't find any of these articles what the data was last year it's not

574
00:35:47,328 --> 00:35:53,472
On the sound ation website

575
00:35:53,728 --> 00:35:55,776
Idea how to contextualize

576
00:35:56,032 --> 00:35:57,312
Interesting lead the victims

577
00:35:57,568 --> 00:36:00,640
Communism Memorial Foundation. Just based on its name

578
00:36:00,896 --> 00:36:07,040
Doesn't seem like it's an unbiased source of information

579
00:36:07,296 --> 00:36:08,064
Congress and 9th

580
00:36:09,088 --> 00:36:15,232
After being proposed by representative

581
00:36:15,744 --> 00:36:21,888
That motherfuker

582
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:24,192
F***** by

583
00:36:24,704 --> 00:36:28,288
Really that's not a great cruise for sister

584
00:36:28,544 --> 00:36:32,128
Victims of Communism Oriole Foundation record

585
00:36:32,384 --> 00:36:34,176
An authorized

586
00:36:34,432 --> 00:36:35,200
The truth about

587
00:36:35,712 --> 00:36:37,504
Interesting

588
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,552
Information that's available on propublica

589
00:36:39,808 --> 00:36:40,320
A trend of

590
00:36:40,576 --> 00:36:42,368
Increase cash flow in recent years

591
00:36:43,136 --> 00:36:49,280
Clear 1013a little bit over $1000000

592
00:36:50,816 --> 00:36:56,960
And 5.8 million in 2015 2016

593
00:36:57,216 --> 00:37:00,032
And I was not available tax records

594
00:37:00,288 --> 00:37:00,800
Another job

595
00:37:01,312 --> 00:37:07,456
Wherever the funding might be coming from which is unclear I can't figure it out the probably funneled through

596
00:37:10,784 --> 00:37:11,296
Now

597
00:37:11,808 --> 00:37:17,952
Individual donors

598
00:37:18,208 --> 00:37:20,256
That money one thing is very

599
00:37:21,024 --> 00:37:24,096
The communism Memorial Foundation

600
00:37:24,352 --> 00:37:25,376
Was founded by an organization

601
00:37:25,632 --> 00:37:27,424
Asian called National captive Nations

602
00:37:28,448 --> 00:37:30,240
The mcmc with an organization

603
00:37:30,752 --> 00:37:33,312
It was founded by quote

604
00:37:33,824 --> 00:37:35,616
Who came to the US after World War II

605
00:37:35,872 --> 00:37:37,152
Largely members of a group

606
00:37:37,408 --> 00:37:38,432
Call the organization

607
00:37:38,944 --> 00:37:39,456
Cranium National

608
00:37:40,224 --> 00:37:43,296
Members of the group collaborated with a Nazi

609
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:44,320
He's rounded up Jews

610
00:37:44,576 --> 00:37:45,856
And assisted in assassinating

611
00:37:46,368 --> 00:37:47,904
And Exterminating thousand

612
00:37:48,928 --> 00:37:50,976
In 1946 they rebranded as

613
00:37:51,232 --> 00:37:52,768
Is the anti-bolshevik block of nation

614
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:56,096
Under the leadership of a man named jaroslav

615
00:37:57,376 --> 00:37:58,400
It seemed like you were trying to get my

616
00:38:00,704 --> 00:38:02,496
I'm just amazed

617
00:38:04,032 --> 00:38:06,080
Brilliant strategy

618
00:38:07,104 --> 00:38:08,640
We're super not to collaborate

619
00:38:10,944 --> 00:38:14,784
We're super Nazi Collaborators and that would probably not go over as well

620
00:38:19,648 --> 00:38:22,208
Bolshevik

621
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:24,768
When they arrived in the United States

622
00:38:25,024 --> 00:38:27,072
Began organizing

623
00:38:28,096 --> 00:38:31,168
Weather for themselves as representatives of populations of countries

624
00:38:31,424 --> 00:38:33,472
Press by communism

625
00:38:34,752 --> 00:38:38,592
These people are not

626
00:38:38,848 --> 00:38:40,384
Somehow

627
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:41,408
Considered

628
00:38:42,688 --> 00:38:44,480
Allowed allowed to come over

629
00:38:44,736 --> 00:38:46,528
Really feel like that's not the same

630
00:38:47,296 --> 00:38:49,856
I'd like that shouldn't be

631
00:38:50,112 --> 00:38:51,904
It was a perfect time to do that

632
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:53,952
Anti-communism was real hot that

633
00:38:54,464 --> 00:38:56,768
And they began to become active in the Republican National

634
00:38:57,024 --> 00:38:57,536
Committee

635
00:38:57,792 --> 00:39:00,608
The national competitions committee grew out of that

636
00:39:00,864 --> 00:39:01,888
And then in 1990

637
00:39:02,144 --> 00:39:03,168
34 mg victims

638
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:04,704
Communism Memorial sound a

639
00:39:05,472 --> 00:39:08,032
Well there's no doubt that Communism had a chair problem

640
00:39:08,288 --> 00:39:12,640
Some governments that included communist systems over history have their share of blood on their hands

641
00:39:13,152 --> 00:39:14,944
But also it should be pointed out that

642
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,224
Communist propaganda

643
00:39:16,736 --> 00:39:19,808
Tirelessly to inflate the number of deaths that communism is

644
00:39:20,064 --> 00:39:20,576
Responsible for

645
00:39:21,344 --> 00:39:25,440
One of the ways they do this is to include the deaths of Soviet soldiers who died fighting Nazi

646
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:29,536
Reason world war is part of their number of deaths blamed on communism

647
00:39:29,792 --> 00:39:34,656
Statistic which is obviously intellectually very dishonest

648
00:39:34,912 --> 00:39:35,424
Include

649
00:39:35,936 --> 00:39:42,080
The people that were fighting literally against them

650
00:39:42,336 --> 00:39:43,104
Weird

651
00:39:43,616 --> 00:39:45,408
Well we can't say that

652
00:39:45,664 --> 00:39:46,432
Communist sentiment

653
00:39:46,688 --> 00:39:50,016
Traces back to this motivation at least in the case of the end the end

654
00:39:50,272 --> 00:39:52,320
It's very clear that the route is not the Apollo

655
00:39:53,088 --> 00:39:53,600
The Thundermans

656
00:39:53,856 --> 00:39:57,440
Are the Fundamentals by misrepresenting

657
00:39:57,952 --> 00:40:00,000
Is the make the crimes of Hitler seem smaller

658
00:40:00,512 --> 00:40:01,536
Racine Alex present

659
00:40:01,792 --> 00:40:02,560
This is very line of argument

660
00:40:02,816 --> 00:40:03,840
Time and time again

661
00:40:04,096 --> 00:40:07,424
We don't say things like Hitler was so much worse

662
00:40:07,936 --> 00:40:09,472
I'm sure this isn't always the case

663
00:40:09,728 --> 00:40:11,520
But in the case of the ncmc

664
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:13,824
Their reason for making this argument is

665
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:16,384
Because they were literally fighting alongside Nazi

666
00:40:19,456 --> 00:40:23,808
So once again Alex is inadvertently promoting Nazi propaganda

667
00:40:27,136 --> 00:40:27,648
People

668
00:40:30,976 --> 00:40:31,744
This isn't too hard

669
00:40:32,768 --> 00:40:33,280
It's not hard to

670
00:40:33,536 --> 00:40:34,560
To find this information

671
00:40:35,072 --> 00:40:37,376
But you doubt you Google the study

672
00:40:37,888 --> 00:40:39,936
Find a study

673
00:40:40,192 --> 00:40:41,728
The organization

674
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:46,080
Alex

675
00:40:46,336 --> 00:40:48,128
Like like legitimately

676
00:40:48,384 --> 00:40:49,152
Presenting

677
00:40:49,408 --> 00:40:49,920
Things

678
00:40:50,176 --> 00:40:50,688
Traceback

679
00:40:50,944 --> 00:40:53,248
Text to groups that were Nazi Collaborators

680
00:40:54,272 --> 00:40:57,344
Just because they happen to demonize his preferred

681
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:58,112
Group

682
00:40:58,624 --> 00:41:02,464
He's like he doesn't care to look into who they are crazy

683
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:04,000
Man it is

684
00:41:04,256 --> 00:41:04,768
So

685
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:07,840
I'm just going to

686
00:41:08,864 --> 00:41:09,376
Shocking

687
00:41:09,888 --> 00:41:10,912
Set the party of

688
00:41:17,056 --> 00:41:18,592
Infiltrated by these nuts

689
00:41:18,848 --> 00:41:22,944
It's definitely not that the party itself has

690
00:41:26,784 --> 00:41:30,112
The greatest threat

691
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:37,792
Because this isn't about that group they're just the one who did this study

692
00:41:38,048 --> 00:41:41,376
Clearly not unbiased source of

693
00:41:45,472 --> 00:41:50,080
You should probably throw the baby out with the bathwater

694
00:41:50,336 --> 00:41:50,848
Seems like

695
00:41:51,104 --> 00:41:53,151
Would you rather have socialism

696
00:41:58,783 --> 00:42:02,623
So they said it was like

697
00:42:03,391 --> 00:42:04,927
Do you like capitalism

698
00:42:05,183 --> 00:42:07,231
Or do you like socialism fascism

699
00:42:07,487 --> 00:42:12,095
That's a great point that is where Alex

700
00:42:12,351 --> 00:42:12,863
Is presenting this

701
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:13,887
Very dishonest

702
00:42:14,399 --> 00:42:17,215
He's limping together socialism communism and fascism

703
00:42:17,471 --> 00:42:23,615
Because that's the other leads to the other

704
00:42:25,151 --> 00:42:25,663
Economic

705
00:42:29,759 --> 00:42:34,111
In reality the poll that they did found that 44% of Millennials preferred socialism

706
00:42:34,367 --> 00:42:35,391
7%

707
00:42:35,647 --> 00:42:37,183
Communism 7%

708
00:42:38,463 --> 00:42:38,975
So

709
00:42:39,231 --> 00:42:41,791
Now.

710
00:42:42,047 --> 00:42:45,375
I bet they're fun

711
00:42:47,167 --> 00:42:47,679
Probably

712
00:42:48,447 --> 00:42:50,239
The very not be leading beliefs

713
00:42:52,287 --> 00:42:52,799
By Alex

714
00:42:56,127 --> 00:42:57,919
The first one is the most glaring problem

715
00:42:58,175 --> 00:42:58,943
Is Commission

716
00:42:59,455 --> 00:43:00,735
They clearly have a vested interest

717
00:43:00,991 --> 00:43:01,759
Unpresented communism

718
00:43:02,015 --> 00:43:05,087
Socialism

719
00:43:05,343 --> 00:43:05,855
Introducing yourself

720
00:43:06,367 --> 00:43:07,903
Financial interest

721
00:43:08,159 --> 00:43:10,207
Communism is on the rise

722
00:43:10,463 --> 00:43:12,255
I thought they need more funding to educate the

723
00:43:13,279 --> 00:43:15,583
Secondly this is only the second year they've done this

724
00:43:16,095 --> 00:43:19,167
There's no point to it.

725
00:43:19,935 --> 00:43:20,703
Silver past years

726
00:43:20,959 --> 00:43:22,239
Network maybe it's fairly

727
00:43:22,495 --> 00:43:23,775
Normal for you to not to be

728
00:43:24,031 --> 00:43:24,543
Capitalism

729
00:43:25,055 --> 00:43:27,359
A large number of people I knew in high school in 2000

730
00:43:27,615 --> 00:43:28,127
Probably would have been

731
00:43:29,919 --> 00:43:30,687
I don't think that's

732
00:43:31,199 --> 00:43:32,223
Misrepresenting some of

733
00:43:32,479 --> 00:43:33,503
The people I knew

734
00:43:34,015 --> 00:43:36,319
Well I mean capitalism by its very structure

735
00:43:36,575 --> 00:43:37,599
Fox over the youth

736
00:43:41,695 --> 00:43:43,743
Data to back up what was going on at hit

737
00:43:43,999 --> 00:43:44,511
Hickman High School

738
00:43:44,767 --> 00:43:45,535
2000

739
00:43:49,887 --> 00:43:52,703
But I knew

740
00:43:53,215 --> 00:43:56,799
Third problem the real concern here should be that 7% of respondents

741
00:43:58,591 --> 00:44:04,735
That should be the headline here instead of lumping three numbers together in order to further your paranoid activity communist

742
00:44:06,271 --> 00:44:07,807
So now what we have here is Alex

743
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:10,623
Presenting a study from a year ago

744
00:44:10,879 --> 00:44:13,439
Reported in multiple conservative Outlet

745
00:44:13,695 --> 00:44:15,487
As if it were multiple

746
00:44:15,743 --> 00:44:17,791
Datapoint

747
00:44:18,047 --> 00:44:20,863
Just a couple of editorials about the same study

748
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:23,935
That was put out by an organization whose roots go back to

749
00:44:24,191 --> 00:44:30,335
Do unrepentant Nazi apologist pray who came over to America and started working with the Republican

750
00:44:31,359 --> 00:44:33,919
I've now have gained a lot of favor

751
00:44:34,175 --> 00:44:35,711
Because of the popular

752
00:44:35,967 --> 00:44:36,735
Nature of the

753
00:44:36,991 --> 00:44:38,271
The anti-communist

754
00:44:38,527 --> 00:44:39,295
Intimate throughout the

755
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:41,855
Into the Reagan Era

756
00:44:44,415 --> 00:44:44,927
Any reason

757
00:44:45,183 --> 00:44:46,207
To undercut

758
00:44:48,511 --> 00:44:54,399
Study who don't have this service to get involved with them this is banana

759
00:44:57,215 --> 00:45:03,359
I even think that what I'm talking about is kind of a minor part of the story

760
00:45:03,615 --> 00:45:04,127
But I think that is

761
00:45:04,383 --> 00:45:04,895
Because

762
00:45:05,151 --> 00:45:06,687
Whatever the group was

763
00:45:06,943 --> 00:45:07,711
Originally

764
00:45:07,967 --> 00:45:08,991
That's not to say that

765
00:45:09,247 --> 00:45:10,015
People who are running

766
00:45:10,527 --> 00:45:12,831
The victims of Communism Memorial Foundation

767
00:45:14,367 --> 00:45:15,903
Or anything like that

768
00:45:16,159 --> 00:45:17,183
Group had its roots

769
00:45:17,439 --> 00:45:18,463
Doesn't mean that

770
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:20,767
The actors of it

771
00:45:21,023 --> 00:45:21,791
People running it now

772
00:45:22,047 --> 00:45:22,559
Subscribe

773
00:45:23,583 --> 00:45:24,863
Very well be

774
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:26,655
Did the people who have come on board

775
00:45:26,911 --> 00:45:28,447
Just gravitated towards the

776
00:45:28,959 --> 00:45:29,471
Communist

777
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:30,239
Rhetoric

778
00:45:30,495 --> 00:45:35,615
And stuff like that none of their funding comes from a valid whites

779
00:45:35,871 --> 00:45:36,383
Supremacist

780
00:45:38,175 --> 00:45:39,199
Parents may have

781
00:45:42,015 --> 00:45:48,159
So I don't know I'm sure I'm sure I'm guessing the rickets

782
00:45:48,415 --> 00:45:48,927
Probably so

783
00:45:49,695 --> 00:45:52,255
Goddamn

784
00:45:53,535 --> 00:45:56,351
9 intention on

785
00:45:57,119 --> 00:45:57,631
Possible

786
00:45:57,887 --> 00:45:58,655
But there's an insta

787
00:46:01,215 --> 00:46:01,727
In terms of

788
00:46:01,983 --> 00:46:02,751
Doing the study

789
00:46:03,007 --> 00:46:06,591
If you're an anti-communist group and you're doing a what sort of

790
00:46:06,847 --> 00:46:09,151
Government do you prefer

791
00:46:09,663 --> 00:46:10,175
And

792
00:46:10,431 --> 00:46:11,199
You know you get

793
00:46:11,711 --> 00:46:12,223
Demonizing

794
00:46:12,735 --> 00:46:13,503
Communism

795
00:46:13,759 --> 00:46:14,271
Socialism

796
00:46:14,783 --> 00:46:16,063
Assertive responses

797
00:46:16,831 --> 00:46:21,183
Isn't worth reporting in places other than pray Firefox me exact

798
00:46:26,815 --> 00:46:27,839
So

799
00:46:28,095 --> 00:46:28,607
There we go

800
00:46:28,863 --> 00:46:30,911
That that isn't his first part of his

801
00:46:31,167 --> 00:46:31,679
Constellation

802
00:46:32,447 --> 00:46:37,823
And so we seat like I said already star in the sky

803
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:38,591
So far

804
00:46:38,847 --> 00:46:39,359
Not good

805
00:46:39,615 --> 00:46:42,431
But I want to see what he's going to try and connect that to

806
00:46:42,687 --> 00:46:43,711
He's got something else working here

807
00:46:44,735 --> 00:46:47,295
Nautical out today

808
00:46:47,551 --> 00:46:48,831
English band

809
00:46:51,391 --> 00:46:53,695
Generations because they literally

810
00:46:53,951 --> 00:46:54,719
No s***

811
00:46:55,231 --> 00:46:57,791
First of all no s*** secondly

812
00:46:58,559 --> 00:47:01,631
You're connecting article from a year ago

813
00:47:01,887 --> 00:47:03,679
Multiple articles about one study from

814
00:47:03,935 --> 00:47:04,703
Year ago

815
00:47:04,959 --> 00:47:06,751
Not sure why but let's see

816
00:47:08,287 --> 00:47:14,431
This is just came out they have lower IQs

817
00:47:24,415 --> 00:47:26,207
What about you

818
00:47:35,423 --> 00:47:36,703
Social Japanese

819
00:47:46,175 --> 00:47:50,783
No spent less than previous generations because they literally have less money

820
00:47:53,087 --> 00:47:59,231
What money am I

821
00:48:18,687 --> 00:48:24,063
People on the west are less likely to give to charity more likely to steal

822
00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:26,367
There's some again it's another insta

823
00:48:26,623 --> 00:48:27,135
We've talked about

824
00:48:27,391 --> 00:48:30,719
Business studies that give you the

825
00:48:30,975 --> 00:48:32,255
The statistics that you want

826
00:48:32,511 --> 00:48:35,071
To give

827
00:48:35,583 --> 00:48:36,351
It's

828
00:48:41,727 --> 00:48:47,103
Know if you go back you can see the budget is

829
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:49,151
Steaks and then we're all never going to

830
00:48:49,407 --> 00:48:52,223
Exactly

831
00:48:54,015 --> 00:49:00,159
The idea that study shows they have physically lower IQs and stuff like that

832
00:49:00,415 --> 00:49:01,695
He was never going to point out that

833
00:49:01,951 --> 00:49:02,719
The article

834
00:49:03,231 --> 00:49:03,743
He's reading

835
00:49:03,999 --> 00:49:05,279
Is from CNBC

836
00:49:05,791 --> 00:49:08,351
But it's talking about a study was put up by the Federal Reserve

837
00:49:09,887 --> 00:49:11,167
You never bring that up but he does

838
00:49:11,423 --> 00:49:15,519
Okay I will get into the study here in a little bit but in true Alex Jones fashion

839
00:49:16,031 --> 00:49:17,055
He gets totally distracted

840
00:49:17,311 --> 00:49:18,079
Start stalking

841
00:49:19,615 --> 00:49:24,735
It's on top of the 500 billion dollars

842
00:49:28,063 --> 00:49:34,207
Didn't check the robber baron money from the five family she's the only air oven

843
00:49:34,463 --> 00:49:39,327
Croatoan

844
00:49:42,143 --> 00:49:44,447
Jesus Christ

845
00:49:44,703 --> 00:49:45,215
Okay

846
00:49:48,031 --> 00:49:50,079
Somebody

847
00:49:50,591 --> 00:49:51,615
I don't understand how that

848
00:49:52,127 --> 00:49:53,407
For certainly not killing herself

849
00:49:59,295 --> 00:50:05,439
Who does it cover

850
00:50:09,023 --> 00:50:09,791
Literally

851
00:50:10,047 --> 00:50:12,095
Close to half a trillion dollars

852
00:50:12,351 --> 00:50:12,863
You know

853
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:15,935
Single richest man in the world

854
00:50:17,727 --> 00:50:18,495
What

855
00:50:19,007 --> 00:50:19,519
He's not

856
00:50:19,775 --> 00:50:21,311
He's a part of the Vanderbilt family

857
00:50:23,103 --> 00:50:25,663
It turns out that most of the line of his

858
00:50:25,919 --> 00:50:26,431
His family

859
00:50:26,687 --> 00:50:27,711
Because of how

860
00:50:27,967 --> 00:50:28,991
Hanover generation

861
00:50:29,247 --> 00:50:31,039
There's a widening

862
00:50:31,295 --> 00:50:31,807
Set of

863
00:50:32,063 --> 00:50:33,087
Relatives

864
00:50:34,367 --> 00:50:36,415
The money is already

865
00:50:36,927 --> 00:50:41,023
Basically gone parent

866
00:50:41,791 --> 00:50:42,303
Like they just

867
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:43,839
You're not going to get any of

868
00:50:44,095 --> 00:50:46,655
The money likely most likely

869
00:50:46,911 --> 00:50:47,423
I don't have any

870
00:50:47,679 --> 00:50:49,983
I think the base this on

871
00:50:50,239 --> 00:50:52,031
That was protecting him

872
00:50:52,287 --> 00:50:54,847
Him from realizing that most of the money was already

873
00:50:56,383 --> 00:50:57,663
At trying to reinforcing him

874
00:50:57,919 --> 00:50:58,431
But he had to make his own

875
00:50:59,455 --> 00:51:01,759
And he's talked about it interviews about how like that

876
00:51:02,271 --> 00:51:03,295
Set him off on a course

877
00:51:03,807 --> 00:51:05,087
That made his life all the

878
00:51:05,343 --> 00:51:08,159
So

879
00:51:08,415 --> 00:51:09,695
Sylvia Vanderbilt

880
00:51:10,207 --> 00:51:14,815
With the social connections

881
00:51:15,071 --> 00:51:16,351
I mean what is it

882
00:51:19,167 --> 00:51:23,775
The only extends like past three generations and then it's

883
00:51:24,031 --> 00:51:24,543
To diffuse

884
00:51:24,799 --> 00:51:28,383
Stew beef

885
00:51:28,639 --> 00:51:29,151
Completely Center

886
00:51:29,407 --> 00:51:29,919
Paralyzed

887
00:51:32,479 --> 00:51:35,039
As much as we want to imagine that happens all the time

888
00:51:35,551 --> 00:51:36,319
A rich family

889
00:51:36,575 --> 00:51:37,087
Kind of

890
00:51:37,343 --> 00:51:37,855
A fairytale

891
00:51:39,647 --> 00:51:41,183
You had the f****** print

892
00:51:41,439 --> 00:51:42,719
Mary Meghan Markle

893
00:51:43,231 --> 00:51:43,999
Thigpen happen

00:51:44,511 --> 00:51:46,303
Yes never hear about it cuz it's not the f******

895
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:47,071
Prince

896
00:51:49,375 --> 00:51:53,727
Family they don't always end up making a lot of people marry Meghan Markle Rockefeller

897
00:51:53,983 --> 00:51:57,311
All the time

898
00:51:57,567 --> 00:51:58,079
Doesn't always

899
00:51:58,335 --> 00:52:03,199
European royal family

900
00:52:03,455 --> 00:52:04,223
Or whatever

901
00:52:04,479 --> 00:52:05,759
Those stories are more appealing

902
00:52:07,807 --> 00:52:08,575
Anyway

903
00:52:09,087 --> 00:52:09,599
Just talkingshit

904
00:52:14,719 --> 00:52:16,255
The kids are not alright

905
00:52:16,511 --> 00:52:17,023
I guess so

906
00:52:47,999 --> 00:52:51,583
Edible bubbles garbage

907
00:52:54,655 --> 00:52:56,703

I'm dumb and I'm rich

932
00:54:37,567 --> 00:54:39,615
Better into his ideology

933
00:54:39,871 --> 00:54:40,895
Why would you

934
00:54:41,407 --> 00:54:41,919
I'd like

935
00:54:42,687 --> 00:54:44,991

Gut instead of

939
00:54:54,719 --> 00:54:55,487
Reality

940
00:54:56,255 --> 00:54:58,303
You just jump in and be like

Try and fight in

944
00:55:02,399 --> 00:55:03,423
Pretend

945
00:55:03,679 --> 00:55:04,191
Like

946
00:55:05,471 --> 00:55:07,263
Because his dad is a dentist

947
00:55:07,519 --> 00:55:08,799
The higher degree

948
00:55:09,055 --> 00:55:10,847
Family was

949
00:55:11,103 --> 00:55:11,871
Around

950
00:55:12,127 --> 00:55:13,663
John Birch Society assholes

951
00:55:13,919 --> 00:55:16,735
There there

952
00:55:17,247 --> 00:55:20,831
You do a lot of reading there is a veneer of intellectualism over it

953
00:55:21,343 --> 00:55:22,623
He was introduced to that stuff

954
00:55:22,879 --> 00:55:25,183
When he was younger he has a dad who has a higher level

955
00:55:25,439 --> 00:55:26,463
Call degree

956
00:55:26,719 --> 00:55:29,791
I could be there being a real strong desire on his

957
00:55:30,303 --> 00:55:30,815
Park

958
00:55:31,071 --> 00:55:33,375
Do you like hold onto that intellectual

959
00:55:33,631 --> 00:55:34,143
Right

960
00:55:35,167 --> 00:55:36,703
I mean we're at the point now where it's like

961
00:55:36,959 --> 00:55:37,471
Is there any

962
00:55:37,727 --> 00:55:39,263
Intellectual on the right

963
00:55:40,543 --> 00:55:42,079
I can't answer that question

964
00:55:42,335 --> 00:55:47,199
Question you asked me earlier to Alex

965
00:55:47,455 --> 00:55:48,735
I guess coming up

966
00:55:50,271 --> 00:55:51,551
And this is where it like I said

967
00:55:54,623 --> 00:55:55,647
He's trying to make

968
00:55:56,927 --> 00:55:57,439
Really display

969
00:55:59,487 --> 00:56:01,279
Let me hear

970
00:56:03,839 --> 00:56:05,375
Important

971
00:56:06,399 --> 00:56:07,423
Back to reality

972
00:56:18,431 --> 00:56:20,735
Producers

973
00:56:23,295 --> 00:56:24,831
Intimidated and bullied

974
00:56:27,647 --> 00:56:31,487
Animal Farm

975
00:56:35,583 --> 00:56:36,095
.

976
00:56:39,935 --> 00:56:41,215
Intimidating

977
00:56:41,471 --> 00:56:43,263
And making us submit and show

978
00:56:43,519 --> 00:56:49,151
Everything's this system are Will and ensuring

979
00:56:49,919 --> 00:56:51,455
That we will never

980
00:56:52,479 --> 00:56:54,015
Revolt against what they're doing

981
00:56:54,783 --> 00:56:56,063
Georgia Pig

982
00:56:58,111 --> 00:57:01,439
I don't know but I don't know if I want on packback

983
00:57:01,695 --> 00:57:03,231
Too far because really what

984
00:57:03,743 --> 00:57:05,023
Sing is basically like

985
00:57:05,279 --> 00:57:06,815
I think

986
00:57:07,071 --> 00:57:08,095
I finally realized

987
00:57:08,351 --> 00:57:12,703
Imran was talking about like I want to go golf

988
00:57:15,519 --> 00:57:20,639
December 5th 2018 Alex Jones finally gets on board with

989
00:57:21,151 --> 00:57:27,295
Like all of these people they're mad at us cuz we're the producers

990
00:57:34,719 --> 00:57:40,863
Just go please go package that is like sort of a new revelation based on a constant

991
00:57:41,119 --> 00:57:41,887
Malaysian doves

992
00:57:42,143 --> 00:57:44,959
Articles and Zack

993
00:57:45,215 --> 00:57:46,239
Legit

994
00:57:46,751 --> 00:57:47,775
Galt nonsense

995
00:57:49,055 --> 00:57:51,615
Disappoint

996
00:57:51,871 --> 00:57:55,199
Although in some ways would be considered a

997
00:57:55,455 --> 00:58:00,831
Because as we recall Iran

998
00:58:01,087 --> 00:58:06,463
Stupid

999
00:58:06,719 --> 00:58:09,535
Ian ran those where it's at its like

1000
00:58:10,303 --> 00:58:16,447
I mean I don't want to run into it apart that's true there is a hierarchy

1001
00:58:16,703 --> 00:58:22,591
John Birch weirdo and an r and weirdo

1002
00:58:22,847 --> 00:58:25,407
Bulbasaur become a Charizard

1003
00:58:25,663 --> 00:58:26,175
Sorry

1004
00:58:28,735 --> 00:58:34,879
Thank you very much sir I would have gone had I known anything about Pokemon

1005
00:58:37,183 --> 00:58:39,999
The guy who is immediately likes

1006
00:58:48,191 --> 00:58:48,703
How dare you

1007
00:58:49,983 --> 00:58:53,055
So like I said that's disappointing

1008
00:58:53,311 --> 00:58:53,823
The conclusion

1009
00:58:54,335 --> 00:58:55,103
He's been building toward

1010
00:58:56,639 --> 00:58:57,663
Real real disappointing

1011
00:58:58,431 --> 00:58:59,967
Then I also told you earlier

1012
00:59:00,223 --> 00:59:01,759
That I have a theory about where all this

1013
00:59:02,015 --> 00:59:02,527
Is it coming from

1014
00:59:02,783 --> 00:59:03,295
I think

1015
00:59:04,063 --> 00:59:04,575
Plays out

1016
00:59:04,831 --> 00:59:06,879
Next constellation

1017
00:59:07,391 --> 00:59:10,207
No not yet

1018
00:59:10,463 --> 00:59:13,535
We have to wait till Alex

1019
00:59:14,047 --> 00:59:14,559
2 Stars

1020
00:59:14,815 --> 00:59:16,607
To start the second star Alex

1021
00:59:16,863 --> 00:59:17,375
Has brought up

1022
00:59:19,167 --> 00:59:20,191
Into the actual study

1023
00:59:20,703 --> 00:59:22,751
So I have to order the articles

1024
00:59:24,799 --> 00:59:27,871
Consolation

1025
00:59:29,151 --> 00:59:32,479
Think about what they've been able to do

1026
00:59:35,551 --> 00:59:37,599
Call generation the millennials

1027
00:59:38,111 --> 00:59:39,391
People under

1028
00:59:44,255 --> 00:59:45,023
25

1029
00:59:46,303 --> 00:59:48,095
These individuals in every study

1030
00:59:48,607 --> 00:59:49,631
Bob the Robber

1031
00:59:49,887 --> 00:59:53,983
Barbara Steele 11 tell you my birthday

1032
00:59:54,239 --> 00:59:59,359
Love it

1033
00:59:59,615 --> 01:00:02,687
Control other people's lives love it

1034
01:00:05,247 --> 01:00:07,807
National studies communism

1035
01:00:08,063 --> 01:00:09,855
Socialism fascism

1036
01:00:11,647 --> 01:00:12,415
Why

1037
01:00:12,927 --> 01:00:13,695
This current system

1038
01:00:14,975 --> 01:00:16,767
Yeah because they don't work

1039
01:00:17,279 --> 01:00:23,423
Cuz we're poor remember the other cuz we literally don't have as much

1040
01:00:23,679 --> 01:00:25,215
Cuz that's the second star in the constellation

1041
01:00:25,471 --> 01:00:25,983
But

1042
01:00:26,495 --> 01:00:27,519
You hear that clip

1043
01:00:28,031 --> 01:00:31,359
I'm some people might hear that and just laugh at Alex being stupid talk about like all these

1044
01:00:31,871 --> 01:00:32,383
Good morning

1045
01:00:32,639 --> 01:00:38,783
All the time every Rob

1046
01:00:39,039 --> 01:00:41,855
Because my

1047
01:00:42,367 --> 01:00:44,927
Alex Radar

1048
01:00:45,183 --> 01:00:47,231
He's going through in Iraq

1049
01:00:47,487 --> 01:00:47,999
I think

1050
01:00:48,255 --> 01:00:49,791
He just got updated demographic

1051
01:00:50,047 --> 01:00:50,559
Information

1052
01:00:50,815 --> 01:00:53,887
And he's realized

1053
01:00:54,911 --> 01:01:00,799
Okay here on the show about the evils of Ragnarok

1054
01:01:05,151 --> 01:01:08,991
Because he realizes the only people he's got left to scare old people

1055
01:01:09,247 --> 01:01:10,527
Particularly old white people

1056
01:01:10,783 --> 01:01:11,807
And so he's going with

1057
01:01:12,319 --> 01:01:14,623
I think when I hear him do this over-the-top

1058
01:01:14,879 --> 01:01:18,207
Demonization of Millennials that's all I hear is

1059
01:01:18,463 --> 01:01:18,975
Wow

1060
01:01:19,231 --> 01:01:21,535
You got no young people listening to you

1061
01:01:21,791 --> 01:01:24,607
Clever s*** band

1062
01:01:24,863 --> 01:01:31,007
Yeah probably early thirties the youngest people who listen to

1063
01:01:31,263 --> 01:01:35,359
Baby

1064
01:01:35,871 --> 01:01:36,895
Coming up

1065
01:01:44,063 --> 01:01:48,159
Sometimes, sometimes with this like listening to a ton of Alex

1066
01:01:48,415 --> 01:01:48,927
In the past and

1067
01:01:49,183 --> 01:01:49,951
Like trying to

1068
01:01:50,207 --> 01:01:52,767
Contextualize what's going on at that

1069
01:01:54,047 --> 01:01:55,583
I end up thinking it's March

1070
01:01:57,375 --> 01:02:03,519
You cuz I'm listening to a ton of March 2009

1071
01:02:04,543 --> 01:02:06,335
You're talking about WWE

1072
01:02:12,991 --> 01:02:19,135
After that there was the Crown Jewel was the newest one

1073
01:02:19,391 --> 01:02:20,927
Greatest Royal Rumble

1074
01:02:22,463 --> 01:02:22,975
Before that

1075
01:02:23,231 --> 01:02:26,559
But because I and my brain had been living in March

1076
01:02:26,815 --> 01:02:27,839
Alex world

1077
01:02:34,495 --> 01:02:37,823
Crazy

1078
01:02:40,639 --> 01:02:41,663
Level of being in

1079
01:02:41,919 --> 01:02:43,199
In tune with what's going on in Alex

1080
01:02:44,479 --> 01:02:45,759
Eyeworld kind of gives me the

1081
01:02:46,015 --> 01:02:46,527
The ability to look

1082
01:02:47,039 --> 01:02:47,807
Cut through the b*******

1083
01:02:48,831 --> 01:02:53,439
By the way I don't like

1084
01:02:53,695 --> 01:02:54,719
Even for him to be like

1085
01:02:54,975 --> 01:02:58,303
Pandering like a millennial

1086
01:02:58,815 --> 01:02:59,327
Buc-ee's

1087
01:02:59,583 --> 01:03:00,607
He might as well be

1088
01:03:01,119 --> 01:03:02,143
Hack

1089
01:03:02,399 --> 01:03:02,911
Macado's

1090
01:03:03,423 --> 01:03:08,031
And stuff like that those articles that's going around

1091
01:03:08,287 --> 01:03:10,591
If these millennials

1092
01:03:10,847 --> 01:03:16,223
Milano cookies

1093
01:03:16,479 --> 01:03:17,759
Hydra I just

1094
01:03:18,271 --> 01:03:19,807
That's a level of Li

1095
01:03:20,063 --> 01:03:20,575
Like Main Street

1096
01:03:20,831 --> 01:03:22,367
Stream hackery that I think Alex

1097
01:03:23,647 --> 01:03:26,207
Demonizing

1098
01:03:27,743 --> 01:03:29,023
If I had to bet

1099
01:03:29,279 --> 01:03:31,071
Everything I own I would bet it on

1100
01:03:31,327 --> 01:03:32,863
He just recently found out

1101
01:03:33,119 --> 01:03:34,655
That when he got off YouTube

1102
01:03:34,911 --> 01:03:36,703
There are no longer anyone

1103
01:03:36,959 --> 01:03:38,495
Who are young

1104
01:03:38,751 --> 01:03:39,519
Precipitous drop

1105
01:03:40,031 --> 01:03:41,567
And youth listening to his

1106
01:03:43,359 --> 01:03:43,871
King radio

1107
01:03:44,383 --> 01:03:50,527
You have to like go to his website and order to watch his show for the Genesis Communications

1108
01:03:50,783 --> 01:03:51,295
Website

1109
01:03:51,551 --> 01:03:52,063
To find

1110
01:03:52,319 --> 01:03:58,463
Young people go to the communications website

1111
01:03:58,975 --> 01:04:03,583
Everyday I go to the millennial hangout which is what what would you

1112
01:04:03,839 --> 01:04:05,631
It is we go to Rob

1113
01:04:05,887 --> 01:04:08,959
People I say the Walmart parking lot

1114
01:04:09,215 --> 01:04:13,567
Before we go rob 8 to 12 people

1115
01:04:13,823 --> 01:04:16,383
Let's check out and see what the Genesis communication

1116
01:04:16,639 --> 01:04:19,199
Website has up as far as special

1117
01:04:19,455 --> 01:04:20,735
Then we can get this Walmart

1118
01:04:21,247 --> 01:04:22,015
After we robbed

1119
01:04:22,527 --> 01:04:23,807
Absolutely

1120
01:04:24,319 --> 01:04:26,111
So here we go Alex

1121
01:04:26,879 --> 01:04:33,023
Do that second star in the constellation because they're still not a

1122
01:04:33,279 --> 01:04:35,839
Constellation constellation

1123
01:04:36,095 --> 01:04:36,607
If Alex is

1124
01:04:36,863 --> 01:04:37,375
Pretending

1125
01:04:37,631 --> 01:04:38,911
That those three headline

1126
01:04:41,727 --> 01:04:44,031
Never makes it clear that they're all about

1127
01:04:44,287 --> 01:04:45,311
Exactly

1128
01:04:45,567 --> 01:04:47,103
Alright if you want

1129
01:04:48,383 --> 01:04:48,895
Multitude

1130
01:04:49,407 --> 01:04:50,431
And in that case

1131
01:04:50,687 --> 01:04:55,295
I'm trying to see you is his deceitful version

1132
01:04:55,551 --> 01:04:57,087
Exactly

1133
01:04:57,343 --> 01:04:58,623
Alex trying to read

1134
01:04:58,879 --> 01:05:00,671
From that other article

1135
01:05:01,695 --> 01:05:02,207
Second

1136
01:05:08,607 --> 01:05:12,191
That's the first one

1137
01:05:13,215 --> 01:05:14,751
Here's another one

1138
01:05:16,031 --> 01:05:19,871
You'll spend less than previous generations because they literally have less money

1139
01:05:23,199 --> 01:05:28,831
Home construction car sales

1140
01:05:29,087 --> 01:05:30,623
Kamal been blamed on the unit

1141
01:05:30,879 --> 01:05:32,671
Patient preferences of those born

1142
01:05:32,927 --> 01:05:34,207
Between 81

1143
01:05:37,535 --> 01:05:39,327
That means have been

1144
01:05:50,591 --> 01:05:51,871

01:08:42,111 --> 01:08:44,415
Yeah that is what the article is

1215
01:08:44,927 --> 01:08:45,695
That too is me

Rapping like that

1262
01:11:52,063 --> 01:11:52,575
You understand

The first one is

1269
01:12:08,703 --> 01:12:10,239
The Millennials like socialism

1270
01:12:10,751 --> 01:12:14,591
Yes the new one is millennials

1271
01:12:14,847 --> 01:12:15,359
So

1272
01:12:15,615 --> 01:12:16,639
If you're dumb

1273
01:12:16,895 --> 01:12:18,431
You can put it in your head together and be like

1274
01:12:20,223 --> 01:12:20,735
Money

1275
01:12:21,247 --> 01:12:22,527

01:12:30,719 --> 01:12:32,255
Really very Elementary

1282
01:12:33,791 --> 01:12:34,303
Yeah

1283
01:12:34,559 --> 01:12:39,423
Seems like there's a far simpler Occam's razor to this where it's like the system that

1284
01:12:39,935 --> 01:12:43,007
Don't have any money

1285
01:12:44,543 --> 01:12:46,079

Inculcated with a

1305

Unquestioning your politics

01:13:52,127 --> 01:13:52,639
Problem

1312
01:13:55,967 --> 01:13:56,479
Which is

1313
01:13:58,527 --> 01:14:01,343
Be sure do seem to project a lot of themselves

1314
01:14:02,367 --> 01:14:03,903
And

1315
01:14:04,671 --> 01:14:05,695
The same it's the same

1316
01:14:06,207 --> 01:14:07,231
F****** s***

If anybody did this s*** to me I'd burn everything to the f****** ground like you're projecting all of your worst

1322
01:14:27,199 --> 01:14:29,759

For everyone and that includes you you stupid motherfukers

In order for our lives to get better yours will have to

1326
01:14:40,767 --> 01:14:42,815
Do it the other way around

1327
01:14:43,071 --> 01:14:46,399
No but sometimes

1328
01:14:47,935 --> 01:14:50,495
Getting on the Millennials pretty hard

1329
01:14:53,311 --> 01:14:53,823
There's a break

1330
01:14:55,103 --> 01:14:55,871
There's a bright spot

1331
01:14:56,127 --> 01:14:57,407

01:15:01,247 --> 01:15:03,295
You already know about the Millennials in

1334
01:15:06,367 --> 01:15:08,927
Generation Z

1335
01:15:21,215 --> 01:15:26,335
If you take God. The articles are you having left

1336
01:15:26,847 --> 01:15:31,711
Less interest in socialism

1337
01:15:38,367 --> 01:15:40,927
The real world

1338
01:15:41,183 --> 01:15:44,255
Betty Orion High School and so I don't know

1339
01:15:44,511 --> 01:15:46,559
Visinet is it so often

1340
01:15:46,815 --> 01:15:48,863
That was the refrain

1341
01:15:49,119 --> 01:15:50,911
From from what I was growing up

1342
01:15:51,167 --> 01:15:52,447
It's like

1343
01:15:52,959 --> 01:15:56,287
Seen the real world yet so all your liberal ideas are going to be

1344
01:15:56,543 --> 01:15:57,567
What's the weather

1345
01:15:57,823 --> 01:16:02,175
The old like you're not a liberal at 1

1346
01:16:02,431 --> 01:16:04,735
And then it's like we all got into the real world would like

1347
01:16:05,247 --> 01:16:07,295
No you do you guys f*** this up

1348
01:16:11,135 --> 01:16:11,647
Made no secret

1349
01:16:12,159 --> 01:16:12,927
What is my parents

1350
01:16:14,463 --> 01:16:15,231
Stuff like that

1351
01:16:15,743 --> 01:16:16,255
High questions

1352
01:16:18,303 --> 01:16:19,071
Little bit of like the idea

1353
01:16:20,095 --> 01:16:20,863
Fiscal

1354
01:16:21,119 --> 01:16:23,935
Of course like not going as far as to ever really

1355
01:16:24,191 --> 01:16:24,703
Join up with

1356
01:16:25,727 --> 01:16:28,543
Any f****** libertarian groups were they around

1357
01:16:30,591 --> 01:16:32,127
Explore those ideas and I I found him

1358
01:16:32,639 --> 01:16:33,151
Relaxing

1359
01:16:33,663 --> 01:16:35,455
End result

1360
01:16:35,967 --> 01:16:36,479
Questioning

1361
01:16:36,735 --> 01:16:37,503
Exploring

1362
01:16:37,759 --> 01:16:42,879
And then it going further left

1363
01:16:44,415 --> 01:16:47,231
I do I do think so much liberal bashing

1364
01:16:47,487 --> 01:16:47,999
Is

1365
01:16:48,255 --> 01:16:49,535
Subconscious

1366
01:16:50,303 --> 01:16:52,095
Recognition from the Baby Boomers

1367
01:16:52,863 --> 01:16:53,887
Their generation

1368
01:16:54,655 --> 01:16:56,703
Has literally destroyed the world

1369
01:16:59,519 --> 01:17:00,031
Like

1370
01:17:00,287 --> 01:17:02,847
I would love to say that as like a

1371
01:17:03,103 --> 01:17:06,943
Using literally like the way that we use figuratively

1372
01:17:07,455 --> 01:17:08,735
But we in common

1373
01:17:08,991 --> 01:17:09,503
Parlin

1374
01:17:10,527 --> 01:17:14,623
Use it as literally but now it's literally 100%

1375
01:17:14,879 --> 01:17:20,511
We have we have 12 years before climate change is irreversible

1376
01:17:20,767 --> 01:17:24,095
Irreversible

1377
01:17:24,351 --> 01:17:25,631
Spiraling out of control

1378
01:17:25,887 --> 01:17:27,935
And they have to know on some level

1379
01:17:28,191 --> 01:17:29,215
It's their fault

1380
01:17:32,543 --> 01:17:35,359
I mean you don't want to think that you're the reason your kids are going to

1381
01:17:39,455 --> 01:17:40,991
Can you sue an old fux

1382
01:17:41,759 --> 01:17:42,783
That's why

1383
01:17:43,551 --> 01:17:45,855
Did you kill this all get used to it

1384
01:17:46,111 --> 01:17:48,159
I think beyond that even there's a like

1385
01:17:48,415 --> 01:17:49,951
Maybe a kernel of subconscious

1386
01:17:50,207 --> 01:17:51,231
Guilt

1387
01:17:51,487 --> 01:17:51,999
Videos like

1388
01:17:53,023 --> 01:17:54,815
We were doing was maximizing

1389
01:17:55,327 --> 01:17:55,839
What we could

1390
01:17:56,351 --> 01:17:59,935
And probably a lot of people didn't understand the ramifications

1391
01:18:00,447 --> 01:18:00,959
Or Consequences

1392
01:18:01,471 --> 01:18:01,983
Come down the line

1393
01:18:03,007 --> 01:18:05,311
Couldn't hospital it's not it's not necessarily

1394
01:18:05,567 --> 01:18:07,871
We all liked ill-will and

1395
01:18:08,639 --> 01:18:09,151
Malicious

1396
01:18:09,407 --> 01:18:11,711
I think there's probably a

1397
01:18:13,759 --> 01:18:15,295
Same sort of feeling you get when

1398
01:18:15,807 --> 01:18:16,319
You buy some

1399
01:18:17,599 --> 01:18:18,367
You realize you can't pay rent

1400
01:18:18,623 --> 01:18:21,439
Realize

1401
01:18:25,279 --> 01:18:26,559
The pleasurable experience

1402
01:18:27,071 --> 01:18:28,607
If it screws you over later

1403
01:18:28,863 --> 01:18:30,399
I think there's probably a mix of that

1404
01:18:30,911 --> 01:18:31,679
Gilton and the record

1405
01:18:33,215 --> 01:18:33,983
Everyone else is off

1406
01:18:35,263 --> 01:18:36,799
Yeah

1407
01:18:37,055 --> 01:18:38,079
The idea of an in

1408
01:18:38,335 --> 01:18:38,847
Entire

1409
01:18:39,359 --> 01:18:41,919
Country planning 30 years ahead is

1410
01:18:42,687 --> 01:18:44,479
Bananas right

1411
01:18:44,735 --> 01:18:45,247
Like I said

1412
01:18:49,855 --> 01:18:53,695
Show up later in the episode

1413
01:18:54,463 --> 01:18:54,975
Boring

1414
01:18:55,231 --> 01:18:55,743
About the news

1415
01:18:56,255 --> 01:18:56,767
But

1416
01:18:59,071 --> 01:19:02,143
H w a.

1417
01:19:05,215 --> 01:19:06,239
In his next clip

1418
01:19:06,495 --> 01:19:07,519
He celebrate

1419
01:19:07,775 --> 01:19:08,543
Hws death

1420
01:19:09,823 --> 01:19:14,943
A little bit as he starts Ram

1421
01:19:39,263 --> 01:19:42,591
The ugly to celebrate your enemies Destiny but I don't want to

1422
01:19:42,847 --> 01:19:43,359
Conversate

1423
01:19:45,663 --> 01:19:46,175
No

1424
01:19:46,431 --> 01:19:47,455
Just

1425
01:19:48,479 --> 01:19:50,783
Funeral is a ritual is tripe

1426
01:19:51,295 --> 01:19:53,855
To some extent because it is

1427
01:19:54,111 --> 01:19:56,415
I don't know where he's like

1428
01:19:56,927 --> 01:19:58,719
Relishing in the the image

1429
01:19:59,231 --> 01:20:01,279
George W bush waving goodbye to the

1430
01:20:02,303 --> 01:20:04,095
I don't like look I understand

1431
01:20:04,351 --> 01:20:05,375
These people are monsters

1432
01:20:05,631 --> 01:20:07,679
Go fuc yourself

1433
01:20:07,935 --> 01:20:08,959
Insulting that MoMA

1434
01:20:09,727 --> 01:20:10,495
You know what I mean like

1435
01:20:10,751 --> 01:20:11,263
I'm not

1436
01:20:11,519 --> 01:20:14,336
Defending worh w at all

1437
01:20:15,104 --> 01:20:17,152
They both did horrible horrible

1438
01:20:17,664 --> 01:20:19,456
To the world you are like

1439
01:20:19,712 --> 01:20:22,272
Sort of insulting the idea of a son

1440
01:20:22,784 --> 01:20:23,296
Invis

1441
01:20:23,552 --> 01:20:25,088
Funeral of their father

1442
01:20:25,856 --> 01:20:26,624
That isn't human

1443
01:20:26,880 --> 01:20:28,416
To some extent I understand

1444
01:20:29,184 --> 01:20:30,976
Larger issues of how many people

1445
01:20:31,232 --> 01:20:34,048
Lost their children or fathers because of their paws

1446
01:20:34,560 --> 01:20:35,840
That's very valid

1447
01:20:37,120 --> 01:20:37,888
I don't type

1448
01:20:39,424 --> 01:20:41,216
It's not the same conversation

1449
01:20:42,752 --> 01:20:44,288
Lake

1450
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:45,312
Evil things

1451
01:20:46,080 --> 01:20:46,848
Doesn't negate

1452
01:20:47,104 --> 01:20:47,616
The pain of losing

1453
01:20:47,872 --> 01:20:48,384
Your dad

1454
01:20:48,896 --> 01:20:49,664
Mockingjay

1455
01:20:50,176 --> 01:20:50,944
Is never

1456
01:20:51,200 --> 01:20:51,712
Never okay

1457
01:20:52,736 --> 01:20:54,528
And Alex relishes in that a ton

1458
01:20:54,784 --> 01:20:57,600
Now I want to be a dick and disagree with you but I agree

1459
01:20:58,112 --> 01:20:59,136
The other point is

1460
01:21:00,672 --> 01:21:01,184
Year

1461
01:21:01,440 --> 01:21:02,976
How many celebrates all these people

1462
01:21:03,488 --> 01:21:04,768
David Rockefeller died on March

1463
01:21:05,024 --> 01:21:06,048
20th 2017

1464
01:21:06,816 --> 01:21:08,608
So that was last great year

1465
01:21:08,864 --> 01:21:11,936
On May 26th 2017

1466
01:21:14,240 --> 01:21:16,544
It's been fantastic it's March now right

1467
01:21:21,664 --> 01:21:22,944
That would be

1468
01:21:23,200 --> 01:21:27,296
A way more fun Oscars ceremony if they if everybody was like

1469
01:21:27,552 --> 01:21:33,696
F*** that guy we lost this year Memorial

1470
01:21:33,952 --> 01:21:34,976
Just wants to dance around

1471
01:21:35,232 --> 01:21:36,000
Because hwd

1472
01:21:38,048 --> 01:21:39,328
We don't respond eclipse

1473
01:21:39,584 --> 01:21:40,096
Because

1474
01:21:41,376 --> 01:21:41,888
He's just

1475
01:21:42,144 --> 01:21:42,912
Scoring points

1476
01:21:43,168 --> 01:21:43,936
Wherever you can get them

1477
01:21:44,192 --> 01:21:45,728
And I know you agree with him

1478
01:21:46,240 --> 01:21:47,520
Defend

1479
01:21:47,776 --> 01:21:50,080
Aw so what's the point you know what I'm saying

1480
01:21:50,592 --> 01:21:51,616
But when you're saying

1481
01:21:51,872 --> 01:21:56,480
It's been a great year all these levels to died and I feel like you might not have a handle

1482
01:21:58,272 --> 01:21:59,040
Wendy's

1483
01:21:59,296 --> 01:22:01,088
Xerox big bad guys

1484
01:22:01,856 --> 01:22:03,648
Ivan Ivan

1485
01:22:05,184 --> 01:22:06,720
Spending the day with it

1486
01:22:08,256 --> 01:22:11,072
Hws death because of course as you know my

1487
01:22:11,328 --> 01:22:12,608
Delighted

1488
01:22:14,400 --> 01:22:14,912
Great monster

1489
01:22:15,424 --> 01:22:15,936
History dying is

1490
01:22:17,472 --> 01:22:18,496
An unending song

1491
01:22:20,032 --> 01:22:22,592
The only thing that I think about right

1492
01:22:24,128 --> 01:22:25,664
In regards

1493
01:22:27,200 --> 01:22:28,480
It is

1494
01:22:31,552 --> 01:22:32,064
I believe it

1495
01:22:33,088 --> 01:22:33,600
EJ Bradford

1496
01:22:34,624 --> 01:22:36,672
Guy who was

1497
01:22:36,928 --> 01:22:37,952
Straight up murdered

1498
01:22:39,488 --> 01:22:40,000
By the cops

1499
01:22:40,512 --> 01:22:42,560
Who suspected him of

1500
01:22:43,072 --> 01:22:44,352
Being bathed

1501
01:22:47,168 --> 01:22:47,936
Straight up murder

1502
01:22:48,448 --> 01:22:48,960
And

1503
01:22:49,984 --> 01:22:50,496
Everyone

1504
01:22:52,032 --> 01:22:56,896
Not ever no absolutely not everyone a very vocal minority people are protest

1505
01:22:57,408 --> 01:22:58,176
To get that video out

1506
01:22:58,432 --> 01:23:01,248
To try and make sure that somebody is held accountable

1507
01:23:01,504 --> 01:23:02,528
For the cops murdering

1508
01:23:04,576 --> 01:23:05,600
You can read online

1509
01:23:06,112 --> 01:23:06,880
So many like

1510
01:23:07,392 --> 01:23:11,488
How dare they talked about this guy in this guy was a criminal in all of this

1511
01:23:14,816 --> 01:23:17,376
And then you listen to the

1512
01:23:17,888 --> 01:23:24,032
Glowing non-stop eulogy

1513
01:23:24,544 --> 01:23:25,568
I don't give a s***

1514
01:23:26,336 --> 01:23:27,104
I am

1515
01:23:27,360 --> 01:23:28,128
Furious

1516
01:23:28,384 --> 01:23:30,944
So it's awful it's awful

1517
01:23:31,200 --> 01:23:33,248
Position points out what is wrong

1518
01:23:33,504 --> 01:23:35,552
What's the way we deal with

1519
01:23:38,368 --> 01:23:39,648
I might be dead was black

1520
01:23:40,416 --> 01:23:44,256
What is awful that we have to deal with

1521
01:23:44,512 --> 01:23:47,840
Anything away from that but I

1522
01:23:49,376 --> 01:23:49,888
Time

1523
01:23:50,400 --> 01:23:51,168
President dies

1524
01:23:51,424 --> 01:23:52,704
Former president dies

1525
01:23:53,216 --> 01:23:53,728
If you want to do it

1526
01:23:53,984 --> 01:23:55,520
Why is everyone covering

1527
01:23:55,776 --> 01:24:01,920
Bad guy f****** conversation

1528
01:24:03,712 --> 01:24:07,296
That come from people who are aligned with his political

1529
01:24:08,064 --> 01:24:09,344
Portals are going to f****** happen

1530
01:24:09,856 --> 01:24:10,624
For sure

1531
01:24:10,880 --> 01:24:14,976
Di Fara critiques of him to come out after his death and everyone's like God's too soon

1532
01:24:18,048 --> 01:24:21,120
Of course the people who are making

1533
01:24:21,632 --> 01:24:22,144
It's all f***

1534
01:24:22,400 --> 01:24:22,912
Stupid

1535
01:24:23,168 --> 01:24:24,192
Absolute

1536
01:24:25,728 --> 01:24:26,752
The greater point of

1537
01:24:29,312 --> 01:24:30,592
Mocking morning is

1538
01:24:30,848 --> 01:24:31,360
Shity

1539
01:24:31,616 --> 01:24:33,408
No matter where it happens

1540
01:24:34,688 --> 01:24:36,736
It's the same thing with Alex Jones

1541
01:24:37,248 --> 01:24:38,016
On his show

1542
01:24:38,528 --> 01:24:39,040
Wayne like

1543
01:24:39,296 --> 01:24:40,064
People are putting

1544
01:24:41,344 --> 01:24:42,624
Bouquets of flowers

1545
01:24:42,880 --> 01:24:44,416
Where Michael Brown died

1546
01:24:46,720 --> 01:24:47,232
This guy was a

1547
01:24:47,488 --> 01:24:50,048
Bad guy

1548
01:24:50,304 --> 01:24:52,352
I feel the same way about

1549
01:24:52,608 --> 01:24:54,144
Hearing that rhetoric as I

1550
01:24:54,656 --> 01:24:55,424
Hearing Alex

1551
01:24:55,936 --> 01:24:56,448
Mocking

1552
01:24:56,960 --> 01:24:57,984
Waving goodbye to you

1553
01:24:58,240 --> 01:24:58,752
Your dad's her

1554
01:25:00,032 --> 01:25:01,312
I don't I don't know I'm not trying

1555
01:25:01,824 --> 01:25:03,104
I'm walking this fine line cuz

1556
01:25:03,360 --> 01:25:04,384
I'm not defending

1557
01:25:04,640 --> 01:25:06,688
Seems like all they still have feelings

1558
01:25:07,200 --> 01:25:07,712
I like that it's just

1559
01:25:08,480 --> 01:25:08,992
Off

1560
01:25:09,504 --> 01:25:12,320
I am I was

1561
01:25:12,832 --> 01:25:13,600
Hoping that you would

1562
01:25:13,856 --> 01:25:14,368
Say your product

1563
01:25:18,464 --> 01:25:24,096
Because I wasn't because I

1564
01:25:24,352 --> 01:25:25,120
Pre-empted that with

1565
01:25:25,376 --> 01:25:31,520
Explaining my position

1566
01:25:31,776 --> 01:25:33,824
Damn it I don't know

1567
01:25:34,336 --> 01:25:35,872
I don't know if we can ever

1568
01:25:36,128 --> 01:25:36,640
Truly trust

1569
01:25:39,200 --> 01:25:39,968
Well look

1570
01:25:40,224 --> 01:25:41,248
I don't know if I'm proud of

1571
01:25:41,760 --> 01:25:46,624
But I will say no mothers need to be

1572
01:25:46,880 --> 01:25:47,904
Kick them off their knees

1573
01:25:48,160 --> 01:25:52,000
Oh no you're not bringing up

1574
01:25:54,560 --> 01:25:57,120

1578
01:26:02,496 --> 01:26:03,008
Lindsey

1579
01:26:04,544 --> 01:26:05,056
After his enemies

1580
01:26:06,592 --> 01:26:08,384
Celebrate

1581
01:26:08,896 --> 01:26:13,504
And misrepresent what they are what they do and what they stand for

1582
01:26:15,296 --> 01:26:15,808
Because he's so full of

1583
01:26:16,064 --> 01:26:16,576
Bulshit

1584
01:26:16,832 --> 01:26:18,880
But if you make it through that desert

1585
01:26:20,928 --> 01:26:23,232
Where we realize I was just talking about it

1586
01:26:23,488 --> 01:26:25,792
This clip

1587
01:26:26,048 --> 01:26:27,328
Listen to The Proud boys

1588
01:26:27,584 --> 01:26:28,864
But it's in the middle

1589
01:26:29,888 --> 01:26:31,168
Remember the proud boys

1590
01:26:34,240 --> 01:26:36,544

01:27:05,472 --> 01:27:09,056
Listed as a domestic extremist group

1598
01:27:09,312 --> 01:27:09,824
They are

1599
01:27:13,152 --> 01:27:16,992
They got removed off of Twitter and always other places

1600
01:27:19,040 --> 01:27:21,344
Came out today and said we never did that

1601
01:27:21,856 --> 01:27:24,672
That's not true what he's talking about

1602
01:27:30,304 --> 01:27:33,632
Is recognized

1603
01:27:33,888 --> 01:27:34,656
As a hate organ

1604
01:27:39,008 --> 01:27:40,800
Because we're going to fall off

1605
01:27:42,592 --> 01:27:44,384
API Trump do this

Disseminating information that comes from

More than 12

1628
01:29:49,056 --> 01:29:52,128
Has he has like the sale that's just an extension

1634
01:30:22,336 --> 01:30:24,384
Otherwise there'd be no reason to sell

1635
01:30:24,640 --> 01:30:27,456
Anything Alex tops

1636
01:30:28,736 --> 01:30:29,248
Something like that

1637
01:30:32,320 --> 01:30:33,856
There is also a mean

Fair

1641
01:30:40,768 --> 01:30:42,560
The guardian had an article out today

1642
01:30:42,816 --> 01:30:44,352
Discussing how

1643
01:30:44,608 --> 01:30:45,120
F******

1644
01:30:45,376 --> 01:30:49,216
The police are and are specifically targeting

1645
01:30:49,472 --> 01:30:50,752
Antifa protesters

1646
01:30:52,544 --> 01:30:53,824
The ones who were

1647
01:30:57,664 --> 01:30:58,688

1648
01:30:58,944 --> 01:31:00,224
Charge

1649
01:31:00,736 --> 01:31:01,504

Let's

1653
01:31:08,928 --> 01:31:12,256
Even Anderson California even in the most liberal place

1654
01:31:12,768 --> 01:31:16,096
The police are an arm of the white nationalist

1655
01:31:16,352 --> 01:31:16,864
Fascist

1656
01:31:17,376 --> 01:31:18,656

Matched up

1663
01:31:30,944 --> 01:31:31,456
It's clear that

1664
01:31:31,712 --> 01:31:32,992
The proud boys charged

1665
01:31:33,248 --> 01:31:34,272
The other people

1666
01:31:34,784 --> 01:31:37,088
Before they threw yet

1667
01:31:37,344 --> 01:31:40,160
All you can see is

1668
01:31:40,416 --> 01:31:42,464
Static shock throws something

1669
01:31:42,720 --> 01:31:47,584
The proud boys coming start beating from another angle

1670
01:31:47,840 --> 01:31:48,608
They vary

1671
01:31:48,864 --> 01:31:50,144
Clearly start charging

1672
01:31:50,400 --> 01:31:54,752
And say let's go boys before they person throw something

1673
01:31:55,008 --> 01:31:56,032

Beforehand

1702
01:33:05,408 --> 01:33:06,432
Vaguely secretive

01:33:38,944 --> 01:33:39,968
Constantly talk about it

1711
01:33:40,224 --> 01:33:40,992
It's time to get vile

1712
01:33:43,040 --> 01:33:43,808
What does kick some ass

1713
01:33:44,320 --> 01:33:44,832
That's

1714
01:33:46,624 --> 01:33:47,136
What you think

1715
01:33:47,392 --> 01:33:48,672
You think that dumb f***

1716
01:33:49,184 --> 01:33:54,304
Millennials who you hate Alex who are listening to this sort of rhetoric from a charismatic

1717
01:33:55,840 --> 01:33:56,608
Guess some people

1718
01:33:57,120 --> 01:33:58,912
He's funny guy

1719
01:33:59,168 --> 01:34:00,192
Hellboy

1720
01:34:01,216 --> 01:34:02,496
This charismatic front

1721
01:34:03,008 --> 01:34:03,520
End of this

1722
01:34:03,776 --> 01:34:04,544
Violence

1723
01:34:06,336 --> 01:34:07,872
Being like all the time for us to get

1724
01:34:09,920 --> 01:34:12,736
Navigate those lights.

1725
01:34:14,016 --> 01:34:14,784
Teaching themselves

1726
01:34:15,040 --> 01:34:16,576
To protect against those people who are against

1727
01:34:16,832 --> 01:34:17,344
What's fascism

1728
01:34:17,856 --> 01:34:19,392
Yep they're a dangerous

1729
01:34:19,648 --> 01:34:21,184
If you're against fascism

1730
01:34:22,720 --> 01:34:23,232
Anti-Theft

1731
01:34:23,488 --> 01:34:24,256
Oh okay

1732
01:34:27,584 --> 01:34:28,096
Spoiler alert

1733
01:34:28,608 --> 01:34:30,400
Little bit later in the episode he's going to have a couple

1734
01:34:30,912 --> 01:34:31,936
So he thinks are proud Boys on

1735
01:34:32,192 --> 01:34:36,288
What are the music

1736
01:34:43,456 --> 01:34:46,784
That is where Rufio, scrubs at the pan man comes from hippie

1737
01:34:50,880 --> 01:34:54,464
Stomach how uncreated really are

1738
01:34:54,976 --> 01:34:58,816
Basically

1739
01:35:00,352 --> 01:35:00,864
The proud boy

1740
01:35:02,656 --> 01:35:03,168
Italy

1741
01:35:03,680 --> 01:35:08,800
She gets on the shows like I'm not a proud boy

1742
01:35:09,568 --> 01:35:15,712
I'm in between

1743
01:35:16,480 --> 01:35:17,504
And

1744
01:35:17,760 --> 01:35:21,344
We'll get it to him in a little

1745
01:35:24,928 --> 01:35:25,440
Alex

1746
01:35:29,280 --> 01:35:29,792
This

1747
01:35:30,048 --> 01:35:30,560
Poses

1748
01:35:31,584 --> 01:35:32,864
Yeah this next clip

1749
01:35:34,912 --> 01:35:35,424
1

1750
01:35:35,680 --> 01:35:36,192
IPad Pro

1751
01:35:36,960 --> 01:35:38,496
I'm in second Alex saying something

1752
01:35:40,800 --> 01:35:43,104
What if they make the entire plane out of the black box

1753
01:35:43,872 --> 01:35:46,432
The successful conversion

1754
01:35:46,944 --> 01:35:47,456
Salonpas

1755
01:35:52,320 --> 01:35:54,368
A large portion of people

1756
01:35:54,624 --> 01:35:55,136
Sure

1757
01:35:56,672 --> 01:35:59,232
52 about

1758
01:36:00,256 --> 01:36:00,768
50

1759
01:36:03,072 --> 01:36:06,912
Percent

1760
01:36:09,728 --> 01:36:12,032
Do you mean 15 to 35 and H

1761
01:36:12,288 --> 01:36:13,568
Okay

1762
01:36:14,336 --> 01:36:16,128
There is like a

1763
01:36:16,640 --> 01:36:18,432
They look at you and they think of you with a group

1764
01:36:18,944 --> 01:36:20,224
Well I don't look at groupthink

1765
01:36:20,480 --> 01:36:21,760
I do I don't look at you

1766
01:36:24,064 --> 01:36:27,392
Important to hold onto for a later clip

1767
01:36:28,416 --> 01:36:33,024
That literally

1768
01:36:34,816 --> 01:36:38,144
He's literally

1769
01:36:43,008 --> 01:36:47,360
They'll be shooting

1770
01:36:47,872 --> 01:36:48,640
You're so stupid

1771
01:36:48,896 --> 01:36:50,176
You should never have said that on air

1772
01:36:50,432 --> 01:36:54,528
If Authority arianism came around they be begging me to work for them

1773
01:36:55,040 --> 01:36:58,112
Call maybe they would insinuate themselves

1774
01:36:58,368 --> 01:36:59,904
In your company as

1775
01:37:01,696 --> 01:37:05,536
Second get you to support their very

1776
01:37:05,792 --> 01:37:06,304
Clearly

1777
01:37:06,560 --> 01:37:07,840
Authoritarian

1778
01:37:08,864 --> 01:37:11,680
Presidential candidate

1779
01:37:12,192 --> 01:37:15,264
For a very long time without

1780
01:37:16,288 --> 01:37:17,312
Real handicap

1781
01:37:17,568 --> 01:37:23,712
Propaganda

1782
01:37:24,224 --> 01:37:25,760
Populist in quote

1783
01:37:27,296 --> 01:37:27,808
You just sort of

1784
01:37:29,600 --> 01:37:33,184
Above

1785
01:37:33,440 --> 01:37:33,952
Partisanship

1786
01:37:34,720 --> 01:37:37,792
To hire somebody who had that

1787
01:37:41,120 --> 01:37:41,632
Realtor

1788
01:37:41,888 --> 01:37:44,448
Attempted authoritarianism

1789
01:37:44,704 --> 01:37:46,496
Is happening in front of our very eyes

1790
01:37:47,008 --> 01:37:52,384
Trying to hire Alex Jones and

1791
01:37:52,640 --> 01:37:54,944
You were successful

1792
01:37:55,712 --> 01:38:01,856
That's a f****** crazy thing for him to say

1793
01:38:06,464 --> 01:38:06,976
That's like

1794
01:38:07,232 --> 01:38:09,792
He's bragging and laughing about it without like

1795
01:38:10,304 --> 01:38:11,584
Recognizing

1796
01:38:12,352 --> 01:38:13,120
That babe

1797
01:38:13,632 --> 01:38:15,168
That really just track with my life

1798
01:38:15,424 --> 01:38:17,216
Yes

1799
01:38:17,472 --> 01:38:22,336
I got on there as soon as this one

1800
01:38:22,592 --> 01:38:26,176
Because he's unsure sums on the East Coast

1801
01:38:26,432 --> 01:38:30,528
He's a he's a f****** liar and a piece of s*** I have deep sources on that

1802
01:38:31,296 --> 01:38:32,064
Flash or couple months

1803
01:38:33,088 --> 01:38:35,648
Talking to this one guy who used to be his camp

1804
01:38:38,464 --> 01:38:44,608
Recruiting

1805
01:38:53,312 --> 01:38:54,848
Seriously in the past

1806
01:38:55,360 --> 01:38:55,872
6 months

1807
01:38:56,128 --> 01:38:57,408
There has never been

1808
01:38:58,176 --> 01:39:01,248
So many times where you listen to Alex talk in your life

1809
01:39:01,504 --> 01:39:04,576
You get it there's a there's a clutter

1810
01:39:05,088 --> 01:39:08,928
There's some like good Angel that's trying to escape from your mouth from time

1811
01:39:10,464 --> 01:39:16,608
Tell the truth

1812
01:39:16,864 --> 01:39:17,632
Way to look at it I think

1813
01:39:17,888 --> 01:39:18,656
More

1814
01:39:18,912 --> 01:39:19,424
It's just like

1815
01:39:19,680 --> 01:39:20,192
Alex

1816
01:39:20,448 --> 01:39:20,960
Kind of gift

1817
01:39:21,216 --> 01:39:21,984
What his place in

1818
01:39:23,520 --> 01:39:24,032
8

1819
01:39:25,568 --> 01:39:27,360
He's trying to express by

1820
01:39:27,616 --> 01:39:28,384
I'm not that f****** stew

1821
01:39:29,152 --> 01:39:30,688
I get what's going on

1822
01:39:33,248 --> 01:39:33,760
But

1823
01:39:34,272 --> 01:39:34,784
I don't know

1824
01:39:35,040 --> 01:39:38,368
You think this is almost his kind of

1825
01:39:38,880 --> 01:39:40,928
A very obvious wink to Rodger

1826
01:39:42,464 --> 01:39:46,304
In a stomach

1827
01:39:46,560 --> 01:39:47,072
Because like

1828
01:39:47,584 --> 01:39:48,352
I see him

1829
01:39:49,632 --> 01:39:50,912
Still just doing what he

1830
01:39:51,168 --> 01:39:51,680
He does

1831
01:39:52,192 --> 01:39:52,704
You know

1832
01:39:52,960 --> 01:39:54,752
Meanwhile all his friends are

1833
01:39:55,008 --> 01:39:55,520
F******

1834
01:39:56,032 --> 01:39:59,360
Rodger is probably

1835
01:40:02,176 --> 01:40:02,688
I still think he's gay

1836
01:40:03,456 --> 01:40:04,992
Dark sources

1837
01:40:05,248 --> 01:40:06,272
I don't think any of it matters

1838
01:40:06,528 --> 01:40:09,600
Like the clearing out the warehouses obviously in order to

1839
01:40:10,624 --> 01:40:14,208
Put

1840
01:40:14,464 --> 01:40:17,024
And then whatever however that works is how that works

1841
01:40:17,280 --> 01:40:18,048
I don't f****** know

1842
01:40:20,096 --> 01:40:21,632
What I do know is

1843
01:40:22,400 --> 01:40:23,424
Corsi is in

1844
01:40:24,448 --> 01:40:24,960
Deep water

1845
01:40:25,472 --> 01:40:25,984
Right now

1846
01:40:28,544 --> 01:40:31,104
Coming up

1847
01:40:31,616 --> 01:40:36,736
About where he has very few moves left on the board with you at all times

1848
01:40:37,248 --> 01:40:37,760
Plane ticket

1849
01:40:38,528 --> 01:40:39,296
Alex

1850
01:40:39,552 --> 01:40:40,064
Be concerned by

1851
01:40:42,368 --> 01:40:45,184
Concerned I don't mean like he's ignoring it and just like

1852
01:40:45,696 --> 01:40:46,208
No yeah

1853
01:40:46,464 --> 01:40:48,000
He's your right he called

1854
01:40:48,256 --> 01:40:52,608
Corsi a weasel

1855
01:40:53,120 --> 01:40:54,656
I think there's a decent chance

1856
01:40:54,912 --> 01:40:55,680
He has been

1857
01:40:56,192 --> 01:40:56,704
This whole time

1858
01:40:56,960 --> 01:40:59,776
No Alex

1859
01:41:00,032 --> 01:41:00,800
He's not dirty

1860
01:41:01,056 --> 01:41:07,200
In all this evil Continuum as more and more pieces

1861
01:41:07,456 --> 01:41:09,760
And Alex

1862
01:41:15,136 --> 01:41:17,184
It's one thing to do your like

1863
01:41:17,440 --> 01:41:18,720
Obfuscating nonsense

1864
01:41:18,976 --> 01:41:20,000
When there is like

1865
01:41:22,304 --> 01:41:22,816
Is

1866
01:41:24,352 --> 01:41:26,656
To do the exact same thing and not change

1867
01:41:27,168 --> 01:41:27,936
Strategy

1868
01:41:29,472 --> 01:41:29,984
That

1869
01:41:30,496 --> 01:41:31,776
That Flynn memo

1870
01:41:32,288 --> 01:41:33,312
Really freaked people

1871
01:41:33,824 --> 01:41:36,896
Like people especially people like Alex who have been

1872
01:41:37,152 --> 01:41:38,432
Presenting the idea that

1873
01:41:39,456 --> 01:41:40,480
Was

1874
01:41:41,248 --> 01:41:43,808
Part instrumental in the

1875
01:41:44,320 --> 01:41:47,904
Deal against Obama involving Russia and

1876
01:41:49,696 --> 01:41:52,000
I think the fact that Alex knows Vic

1877
01:41:52,256 --> 01:41:53,280
He said all those things

1878
01:41:54,048 --> 01:41:54,816
And it's new

1879
01:41:55,328 --> 01:42:00,192
Very clearly cooperating in a serious way with Mueller's investigation

1880
01:42:00,448 --> 01:42:03,776
People doing jail time

1881
01:42:05,568 --> 01:42:08,384
Skit about it either Alex thinks

1882
01:42:08,640 --> 01:42:09,920
Mothers

1883
01:42:15,040 --> 01:42:16,832
And Hoodwink them all

1884
01:42:17,088 --> 01:42:19,392
On some level Alex

1885
01:42:20,160 --> 01:42:20,672
I'm in the car

1886
01:42:21,184 --> 01:42:21,952
I was just getting in

1887
01:42:22,208 --> 01:42:24,000
Information from Liars

1888
01:42:26,048 --> 01:42:30,656
I wasn't that I wasn't doing anything illegal

1889
01:42:30,912 --> 01:42:32,704
I m radio show

1890
01:42:32,960 --> 01:42:36,544
3 degrees away from the crime that's not illegal

1891
01:42:37,056 --> 01:42:39,360
I think there's a part there's a freedom

1892
01:42:39,616 --> 01:42:40,128
For Alex

1893
01:42:40,896 --> 01:42:42,176
Probably the other people don't have

1894
01:42:42,688 --> 01:42:44,992
I think that plays into the Rogers

1895
01:42:45,248 --> 01:42:46,528
Yes we're not going to listen

1896
01:42:47,552 --> 01:42:49,344
Like there's nothing worthwhile

1897
01:42:49,600 --> 01:42:50,112
Thanks

1898

Access to image

1901
01:43:00,608 --> 01:43:03,168
A cornucopia of Rodger Stone being like

1902
01:43:03,424 --> 01:43:06,240
Hey Adam Schiff go f*** yourself like

1903
01:43:06,496 --> 01:43:09,824
Year-and-a-half ago was all just like

1904
01:43:10,080 --> 01:43:11,360
Talking about him pleading the fifth

1905
01:43:11,872 --> 01:43:14,688
His position I actually think that this is fairly accurate

1906
01:43:15,200 --> 01:43:16,224
Based on Infowars

1907
01:43:16,992 --> 01:43:19,552
He's like this isn't news I said I was going to plead

1908
01:43:19,808 --> 01:43:20,576
The 5th before

1909
01:43:21,344 --> 01:43:24,160
That is accurate he has said that on Infowars

1910
01:43:24,416 --> 01:43:28,256
Portuguese

1911
01:43:28,512 --> 01:43:31,072
There's a chance the media's misreporting it as

1912
01:43:31,328 --> 01:43:32,352
Something's that he

1913
01:43:32,864 --> 01:43:33,632
Said before

1914
01:43:34,144 --> 01:43:35,168
I'm fine with that

1915
01:43:35,424 --> 01:43:36,448
His position on it

1916
01:43:36,704 --> 01:43:39,008
About

1917
01:43:39,264 --> 01:43:41,312
And that memo the Mueller memo that came out

1918
01:43:41,824 --> 01:43:42,336
He's like

1919
01:43:43,104 --> 01:43:44,384
Is a lot of stuff that's redacted in

1920
01:43:45,152 --> 01:43:50,272
We really don't know what's going on and I don't want to talk about it until there's more information

1921
01:43:51,040 --> 01:43:53,344
However I am buying a new plane ticket

1922
01:43:53,600 --> 01:43:54,624
Every single day

1923
01:43:56,160 --> 01:43:56,928
That's not something

1924
01:43:57,440 --> 01:43:57,952
Is it matches the

1925
01:43:58,720 --> 01:43:59,488
Games

1926
01:43:59,744 --> 01:44:02,048
Been playing all along

1927
01:44:02,816 --> 01:44:03,328
Cautious with who

1928
01:44:03,584 --> 01:44:04,352
His language

1929
01:44:04,608 --> 01:44:05,888
And Alex is trying to get him to

1930
01:44:06,144 --> 01:44:07,168
The old school Rodger

1931
01:44:07,424 --> 01:44:08,960
He's not playing ball

1932
01:44:09,472 --> 01:44:13,056
Just the clip that you did play of him being like

1933
01:44:13,312 --> 01:44:14,336
Yeah I got it

1934
01:44:14,848 --> 01:44:16,128
Okay

1935
01:44:16,384 --> 01:44:18,432
Yeah is him is him being like

1936
01:44:18,688 --> 01:44:19,200
Dude

1937
01:44:19,456 --> 01:44:19,968
We're

1938
01:44:20,992 --> 01:44:22,272
This b*******

1939
01:44:24,320 --> 01:44:25,088
We need a big

1940
01:44:25,344 --> 01:44:28,416
Call cuz I need more money

1941
01:44:28,672 --> 01:44:29,184
Yeah

1942
01:44:30,464 --> 01:44:33,792
I told you in that last clip there was a

1943
01:44:34,304 --> 01:44:34,816
Well no not the

1944
01:44:36,096 --> 01:44:37,120
There was a bad premise

1945
01:44:37,632 --> 01:44:38,144
Yeah that is

1946
01:44:39,168 --> 01:44:39,680
Millennial

1947
01:44:39,936 --> 01:44:41,984
We don't think anybody in groups

1948
01:44:42,240 --> 01:44:42,752
We're not we're not

1949
01:44:44,800 --> 01:44:45,312
Sure sure sure

1950
01:44:46,592 --> 01:44:47,616
Immediately after this

1951
01:44:47,872 --> 01:44:48,640
He starts to put people into

1952
01:44:51,712 --> 01:44:57,856
Saudi Arabia or Jordan origin

1953
01:45:00,160 --> 01:45:04,256
That's not how that works for bye

1954
01:45:04,512 --> 01:45:07,328
Group two

1955
01:45:11,168 --> 01:45:14,496
Proceed

1956
01:45:14,752 --> 01:45:15,264
F******

1957
01:45:15,520 --> 01:45:16,288
Two groups yet

1958
01:45:16,544 --> 01:45:22,688
Real hard to add the countries in there it's very quickly

1959
01:45:22,944 --> 01:45:23,456
Most

1960
01:45:25,504 --> 01:45:30,112
He's making In that clip Arab countries will take in Palestine

1961
01:45:31,904 --> 01:45:32,928
I would revert that

1962
01:45:33,184 --> 01:45:33,952
But he says

1963
01:45:34,464 --> 01:45:35,232
Next clip

1964
01:45:35,488 --> 01:45:36,000
And I'll do it after

1965
01:45:42,912 --> 01:45:43,424
What

1966
01:45:48,544 --> 01:45:54,688
Call Elise

1967
01:46:05,696 --> 01:46:07,488
Israel's going nowhere

1968
01:46:08,512 --> 01:46:09,536
Nowhere

1969
01:46:10,304 --> 01:46:11,328
Whatever I mean

1970
01:46:11,840 --> 01:46:12,352
I guess

1971
01:46:12,608 --> 01:46:13,120
Like in a

1972
01:46:14,656 --> 01:46:17,472
Sure every whatever I do I don't want to unpack that

1973
01:46:17,728 --> 01:46:19,776
Alex's position on Israel is so f******

1974
01:46:20,032 --> 01:46:24,896
Convoluted and changes over its

1975
01:46:25,152 --> 01:46:27,712
The nth degree I want to talk about this idea

1976
01:46:27,968 --> 01:46:28,992
Palestinian

1977
01:46:29,504 --> 01:46:31,552
Are just Arabs want to take over things

1978
01:46:31,808 --> 01:46:33,344
They already accepted anywhere else

1979
01:46:33,856 --> 01:46:35,392
Pacifically said

1980
01:46:35,648 --> 01:46:38,208
Free land to which is Sir

1981
01:46:38,464 --> 01:46:39,744
Yeah that's not fair is

1982
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:42,560
We could talk about that for now

1983
01:46:42,816 --> 01:46:46,400
Freeland has a very different whatever you think

1984
01:46:46,656 --> 01:46:47,680
The Palestinians

1985
01:46:47,936 --> 01:46:49,472
To do yeah yeah that's a mess

1986
01:46:52,800 --> 01:46:56,128
Not the stock

1987
01:46:56,384 --> 01:46:56,896
Jordan

1988
01:46:57,152 --> 01:46:57,664
Egypt

1989
01:46:58,176 --> 01:47:00,736
But those are two countries that specifically going to talk

1990
01:47:02,016 --> 01:47:04,320
Pretty much entirely wrong about Palestinian

1991
01:47:04,576 --> 01:47:05,088
Immigration

1992
01:47:05,856 --> 01:47:06,880
I need to do debunked

1993
01:47:07,136 --> 01:47:07,904
His entire position

1994
01:47:08,160 --> 01:47:09,696
13 studies

1995
01:47:09,952 --> 01:47:10,464
The UN

1996
01:47:10,720 --> 01:47:11,744
Cuz all the statistics

1997

1999

1 million Palestinians went to Georgia

2000
01:47:19,168 --> 01:47:20,192
50000 went 11

2001

280000 to Libya 242

2002
01:47:23,264 --> 01:47:24,032
2002.

2003
01:47:24,288 --> 01:47:26,080
120,000 to Saudi Arab

2004
01:47:26,848 --> 01:47:27,616
A large percentage

2005
01:47:27,872 --> 01:47:28,384
Which of these people work

2006
01:47:28,640 --> 01:47:29,152
Considered

2007
01:47:31,456 --> 01:47:32,736
Of course they were

2008
01:47:32,992 --> 01:47:35,040
This reflected a bit of an acre

2009
01:47:35,808 --> 01:47:37,856
Census numbers for the migration policy

2010
01:47:38,112 --> 01:47:38,880
Century 2011

2011
01:47:39,136 --> 01:47:40,928
Still showed about 95,000

2012
01:47:45,536 --> 01:47:46,816
It's a Saudi Arabia

Text

2014
01:47:48,864 --> 01:47:49,632

Ranking below Jordan syria-lebanon Saudi Arabia and

2020

Three of those countries the ones that Alex was saying

2021
01:48:05,760 --> 01:48:08,576
Don't accept accept

2022
01:48:08,832 --> 01:48:10,368
One of the difficulties with emigrating

2023

Quote

2025
01:48:13,440 --> 01:48:15,744
These are delivered by the Israeli authorities

2026

Allowed access to

2027

Palestinian holders of an identity document

2029

Including those with 4in

Must pass through border post Reserve Palestinian

The Allenby bridge in Jericho

2032
01:48:31,104 --> 01:48:33,664
Is the only crossing point for West Point

2033
01:48:34,432 --> 01:48:38,016
West Bank Palestinians wishing to reach Jordan and travel further afield

2034
01:48:38,528 --> 01:48:40,576
It's fully controlled by Israel

2035
01:48:42,624 --> 01:48:46,464
They control outward immigration

2036
01:48:53,120 --> 01:48:55,424
A 2000 study out of the forced migration and

2037
01:48:55,680 --> 01:48:56,704
Ug studies program at

2038
01:48:56,960 --> 01:48:58,240
American University

2039

2006

2041
01:49:01,824 --> 01:49:02,848
Consistent level of

2042
01:49:03,616 --> 01:49:07,456
Percent of the world Palestinian population lived in Arab countries other than

2043
01:49:07,712 --> 01:49:08,224
Jordan

2044
01:49:08,736 --> 01:49:11,808
I specify that only because Jordan is considered individually

2045
01:49:12,064 --> 01:49:13,088
Statistics reflecting

2046
01:49:13,600 --> 01:49:14,624
Very high-powered

2047
01:49:16,160 --> 01:49:19,232
All this is to say that has no f****** idea what he's talkin

2048
01:49:19,488 --> 01:49:20,768
And all this reflected

2049
01:49:21,024 --> 01:49:21,792
The deep-seated bigotry

2050
01:49:22,304 --> 01:49:22,816
Being present

2051
01:49:23,072 --> 01:49:23,840
Did as knowledge

2052
01:49:24,096 --> 01:49:26,400
And in that clip he's yelling about people

2053
01:49:26,656 --> 01:49:28,192
These double leftist to come up

2054
01:49:28,448 --> 01:49:31,264
And say hey you should support Palestinians

2055
01:49:31,520 --> 01:49:35,360
We know that in 2019

2056
01:49:35,616 --> 01:49:36,896
The absolutely

2057
01:49:37,408 --> 01:49:38,432
Very strongly

2058
01:49:40,480 --> 01:49:45,600
Wishi-washi wano not in like a dairy in favor of the Palestinian issue

2059
01:49:45,856 --> 01:49:52,000
Not even like a Israel to be able to

2060
01:49:52,256 --> 01:49:53,024
It was like hey

2061
01:49:56,608 --> 01:49:57,120
Rights

2062
01:49:57,376 --> 01:49:58,656
He knows it he have that position

2063
01:49:58,912 --> 01:49:59,680
Then which is

2064
01:49:59,936 --> 01:50:00,448
Completely

2065
01:50:00,704 --> 01:50:02,752
Any presenting this idea of left

2066
01:50:03,008 --> 01:50:07,104
Just to come up to him and they're like hey you know all this and he's mad because

2067
01:50:07,360 --> 01:50:09,664
You guys don't have statute

2068
01:50:11,456 --> 01:50:11,968

Victor Punk

2071
01:50:17,088 --> 01:50:18,368
Entirely his idea that there's

2072
01:50:18,624 --> 01:50:21,440
No Palestinians in Saudi Arabia

2073
01:50:21,696 --> 01:50:22,976
Jordan has so many

2074
01:50:23,744 --> 01:50:24,256
Palestinian

2075
01:50:25,280 --> 01:50:25,792
Crazy

2076
01:50:26,048 --> 01:50:26,560
Bananas

2077
01:50:28,096 --> 01:50:30,656
I'd like to imagine that so much of

2078
01:50:30,912 --> 01:50:31,424
Alex's

2079
01:50:31,680 --> 01:50:32,192
Leftist

2080
01:50:32,448 --> 01:50:33,216
Talking points

2081
01:50:34,496 --> 01:50:35,520
Just came up to me on the street

2082
01:50:35,776 --> 01:50:41,920
Just I just travel traveling him that's just hanging around

2083
01:50:42,176 --> 01:50:43,968
You remember when you believe this

2084
01:50:44,224 --> 01:50:48,576
You suck know what it is is like you probably had a dream

2085
01:50:49,600 --> 01:50:50,112
Cancel

2086
01:50:50,368 --> 01:50:52,928
You come

2087
01:50:53,184 --> 01:50:54,208
F****** dumbass

2088
01:50:57,024 --> 01:50:58,048
I'm guessing

2089
01:50:58,304 --> 01:50:58,816
Just guilt

2090
01:50:59,072 --> 01:50:59,840
It's just dumb

2091
01:51:00,096 --> 01:51:01,376
Guilt about his hand position

2092
01:51:02,912 --> 01:51:04,448
Understanding

2093
01:51:04,960 --> 01:51:05,728
Is advocating

2094
01:51:06,240 --> 01:51:08,544
Like being killed for no reason I was against that

2095
01:51:09,824 --> 01:51:12,384
For whatever reason I'm now super into it

2096
01:51:12,640 --> 01:51:13,664
Who knows what that is

2097
01:51:17,504 --> 01:51:19,552
Crazy

2098
01:51:19,808 --> 01:51:21,088
But this is so f******

2099
01:51:23,648 --> 01:51:24,160
Stupid

2100
01:51:24,416 --> 01:51:25,184
Thank you don't even have

2101
01:51:26,208 --> 01:51:27,744
Support Palestinian rights

2102
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:29,024
To think that that's stupid

2103
01:51:30,560 --> 01:51:33,120
No that's even if you're against

2104
01:51:33,376 --> 01:51:33,888
The Palestine

2105
01:51:34,400 --> 01:51:35,424
Making an argument

2106
01:51:35,680 --> 01:51:36,704
Arab countries

2107
01:51:36,960 --> 01:51:38,496
Don't accept Palestinian

2108
01:51:39,520 --> 01:51:40,288
He's crazy.

2109
01:51:40,800 --> 01:51:46,944
Not even noted propagandists and liar Bibi Netanyahu it like that

2110
01:51:47,968 --> 01:51:48,992
Pamela Geller would say

2111
01:51:49,248 --> 01:51:50,272
Something like that

2112
01:51:52,832 --> 01:51:54,880
That but

2113
01:51:55,904 --> 01:51:56,928
But Alex

2114
01:51:57,184 --> 01:51:57,696
Think about that stuff

2115
01:51:58,464 --> 01:51:58,976
Good

2116
01:52:00,256 --> 01:52:02,304
Feeling the spirit starts yelling about how West

2117
01:52:04,352 --> 01:52:06,400
Countries are under attack

2118
01:52:08,448 --> 01:52:13,056
Market

2119
01:52:13,312 --> 01:52:18,688
Porsche

2120
01:52:18,944 --> 01:52:25,088
Mexican

2121
01:52:25,344 --> 01:52:29,952
You do

2122
01:52:30,208 --> 01:52:33,024
He saying already like the idea of like

2123
01:52:33,280 --> 01:52:34,048
To not worship

2124
01:52:34,560 --> 01:52:37,376
You think that atheists are a satanic organization

2125
01:52:43,520 --> 01:52:49,664
Future

2126
01:52:50,176 --> 01:52:51,712
What if you're in Palatine

2127
01:52:51,968 --> 01:52:56,064
Millennial

2128
01:52:56,576 --> 01:53:00,160
Now Alex is taking that 44%

2129
01:53:00,416 --> 01:53:03,232
44% interested in socialism

2130
01:53:03,488 --> 01:53:09,632
7% each for communism and fascism

2131
01:53:09,888 --> 01:53:12,448
Making up number

2132
01:53:13,728 --> 01:53:16,544
45%

2133
01:53:25,248 --> 01:53:30,112
That's a point

2134
01:53:30,368 --> 01:53:30,880
I don't agree with that

2135
01:53:31,136 --> 01:53:37,280
Yeah I know that's right

2136
01:53:37,536 --> 01:53:39,072
Molesting

2137
01:53:39,328 --> 01:53:40,352
You can just be conniving

2138
01:53:41,120 --> 01:53:44,960
That works nothing in China

2139
01:53:58,784 --> 01:54:04,928
Market

2140
01:54:09,536 --> 01:54:13,120

2141
01:54:13,376 --> 01:54:16,960
Okay wow

2142
01:54:17,216 --> 01:54:17,984
That's nuts

2143
01:54:18,240 --> 01:54:19,776
All right without man

2144
01:54:20,800 --> 01:54:22,592
It wasn't embarrassing enough

2145
01:54:22,848 --> 01:54:25,664
Crafts nonsense Betty just pulled their

2146
01:54:26,176 --> 01:54:26,944
This next clip

2147
01:54:27,200 --> 01:54:27,968
I honestly think

2148
01:54:28,224 --> 01:54:28,992
Is one of my favorites

2149
01:54:30,784 --> 01:54:31,808
Enjoy this

2150
01:54:32,064 --> 01:54:33,088
Because you talkin some s***

01:54:37,440 --> 01:54:37,952
The bushes

2155
01:54:38,720 --> 01:54:39,488
Skull and bones

2156
01:54:40,512 --> 01:54:41,024
They are

2157
01:54:43,072 --> 01:54:43,584
He gets into

2158
01:54:43,840 --> 01:54:44,352
Evidence

2159
01:54:51,008 --> 01:54:51,776
Coral

2160
01:54:52,288 --> 01:54:53,824
Choir music of a

2161
01:54:54,080 --> 01:54:55,104
HW Bush's.

2162
01:54:55,872 --> 01:54:56,896
Ongoing

2163
01:54:57,152 --> 01:54:57,920
Worship

2164
01:54:59,456 --> 01:55:00,480
Juxtaposed

2165
01:55:04,576 --> 01:55:07,392
Robert De Niro's production of the Good Shepherd

2166
01:55:07,904 --> 01:55:14,048
Bathing in feces

2167
01:55:15,072 --> 01:55:16,096
Pissing on each other

2168
01:55:16,352 --> 01:55:19,680
Bring up a movie

2169
01:55:21,472 --> 01:55:22,752
Have sex

2170
01:55:23,008 --> 01:55:23,776
Yeah but we all want

2171
01:55:29,920 --> 01:55:31,200
Channel the devil

2172
01:55:31,712 --> 01:55:36,064
What is Pantheon of other gods and goddesses entering your body

2173
01:55:41,952 --> 01:55:44,000
Next two weeks

2174
01:55:44,256 --> 01:55:48,352
Almost sacred

2175
01:55:48,608 --> 01:55:54,752
Yep

2176
01:55:55,008 --> 01:55:59,104
To each other

2177
01:55:59,360 --> 01:56:00,128
De Niro movie that he

2178
01:56:00,384 --> 01:56:00,896
He's talking about

2179
01:56:01,664 --> 01:56:07,040
Because I know at least one point I got that I'm just looking for the audio

2180
01:56:07,808 --> 01:56:10,880
But later I know that I heard Joshua Jackson

2181
01:56:11,136 --> 01:56:11,648
Voice

2182
01:56:11,904 --> 01:56:18,048
So he's also playing clips from the skull

2183
01:56:18,304 --> 01:56:19,072
God Rest his soul

2184
01:56:19,328 --> 01:56:20,096
Paul Walker

2185
01:56:21,376 --> 01:56:24,960
Please play these movies about Scala bugs that are

2186
01:56:28,032 --> 01:56:29,056
Proof

2187
01:56:29,312 --> 01:56:30,848
These people f****** Fiji

2188
01:56:31,104 --> 01:56:31,616
Also

2189
01:56:32,128 --> 01:56:33,152
Also come on

2190
01:56:33,664 --> 01:56:36,992
That would be a great General are you shiting me

2191
01:56:37,504 --> 01:56:38,272
You're giving

2192
01:56:39,296 --> 01:56:39,808
Alex

2193
01:56:40,064 --> 01:56:41,856
You think it's ironic it is great

2194
01:56:42,112 --> 01:56:43,648
I just like

2195
01:56:43,904 --> 01:56:45,184
Everything is a goddamn movie

2196
01:56:45,696 --> 01:56:46,720
He doesn't understand

2197
01:56:46,976 --> 01:56:47,488
Differentiate

2198
01:56:51,072 --> 01:56:52,864
I don't f****** know what to do with it but

2199
01:56:53,376 --> 01:56:53,888
Like I said

2200
01:56:54,656 --> 01:56:55,168
We got

2201
01:56:55,680 --> 01:56:56,448
Some proud boy

2202
01:56:56,960 --> 01:56:58,752
Slash proud boys

2203
01:56:59,776 --> 01:57:01,056
We're going to end this episode

2204
01:57:01,312 --> 01:57:02,336
But here in a little bit from them

2205
01:57:03,616 --> 01:57:04,640
Rufio panman

2206
01:57:04,896 --> 01:57:05,408
Very

2207
01:57:05,664 --> 01:57:06,688
Roofied

2208
01:57:07,200 --> 01:57:08,224
Roofied

2209
01:57:08,480 --> 01:57:09,760
He doesn't really talk

2210
01:57:10,016 --> 01:57:14,112
Here's a really factor into this interview much cuz he's been on Alex's show before where is

2211
01:57:14,368 --> 01:57:15,136
Margot

2212
01:57:15,648 --> 01:57:16,928
Has never been on the show before

2213
01:57:20,512 --> 01:57:23,584
Just saying the exact same thing out

2214
01:57:23,840 --> 01:57:28,192
I'm trying to be like I'm at you with this rally I was with you

2215
01:57:28,448 --> 01:57:30,240
That sort of thing there's like a

2216
01:57:30,752 --> 01:57:33,312
A Maga Titan might be starting

2217
01:57:34,080 --> 01:57:36,640
Like a Blog on one of Alex's lights

2218
01:57:37,152 --> 01:57:42,016
I'm not getting involved with Infowars somehow

2219
01:57:42,528 --> 01:57:43,296
I don't think

2220
01:57:43,552 --> 01:57:44,064
I don't give two

2221
01:57:44,320 --> 01:57:46,624
Sucks about anything like that

2222
01:57:48,672 --> 01:57:49,696
Eveready website

2223
01:57:49,952 --> 01:57:51,232
Ever apart of

2224
01:57:51,488 --> 01:57:52,512
I don't want to be a part of

2225
01:57:52,768 --> 01:57:54,304
Any website that has a byline

2226
01:57:55,072 --> 01:57:55,840
Maga Titan

2227
01:57:56,096 --> 01:58:02,240
I don't want to be a member of any club that has

2228
01:58:04,288 --> 01:58:05,312
Classic comedy

2229
01:58:06,848 --> 01:58:07,616
Look I don't want

2230
01:58:08,896 --> 01:58:13,760
The interview is not really Illuminating separate them all three of them all being like

2231
01:58:14,016 --> 01:58:14,784
Were victims

2232
01:58:15,296 --> 01:58:18,368
Of course

2233
01:58:18,624 --> 01:58:20,928
Redundant us

2234
01:58:21,184 --> 01:58:23,744
You you guys get about everyone being Cox and then you

2235
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:27,072
Entire race videos Wild

2236
01:58:31,680 --> 01:58:33,216
There's a couple things that I think are

2237
01:58:34,240 --> 01:58:35,008
Interesting

2238
01:58:36,800 --> 01:58:37,824
Here's the first one

2239
01:58:38,592 --> 01:58:39,872
This is how I woke up

2240
01:58:40,384 --> 01:58:46,528
They folded the $20 bill if you guys have ever seen this is TuneIn right now.

2241
01:58:46,784 --> 01:58:50,624
The bill

2242
01:58:50,880 --> 01:58:51,648
On one side

2243
01:58:51,904 --> 01:58:53,184
The Pentagon on the other side

2244
01:58:56,512 --> 01:58:58,048
9 + 11 is 20

2245
01:58:58,304 --> 01:59:01,120
United Airlines on one side American Airlines on the other side

2246
01:59:01,632 --> 01:59:03,168
I started looking into 911

2247
01:59:03,424 --> 01:59:03,936
Course

2248
01:59:04,960 --> 01:59:06,752
9/11 the road to tyranny popped up

2249
01:59:07,008 --> 01:59:13,152
So you found a dollar hold on it

2250
01:59:17,760 --> 01:59:20,064
9 + 11 + 9/11 equals 20

2251
01:59:20,320 --> 01:59:21,088
$20 bill

2252
01:59:21,344 --> 01:59:24,928
American Airlines

2253
01:59:25,440 --> 01:59:26,720
Why

2254
01:59:26,976 --> 01:59:28,000
Be harder

2255
01:59:33,120 --> 01:59:35,424
Really fun page on Snopes

2256
01:59:35,680 --> 01:59:41,824
Where they talk about this urban legend of folding the dollar bill

2257
01:59:42,080 --> 01:59:43,872
Exactly what they're talking about inside

2258
01:59:44,128 --> 01:59:45,152
Most of the

2259
01:59:45,920 --> 01:59:49,248
Dollar bills in circulation all the forms of bills we have

2260
01:59:49,504 --> 01:59:52,320
Include bushes and buildings and

2261
01:59:52,576 --> 01:59:54,624
You fold them up in the right way you can make it

2262
01:59:54,880 --> 01:59:55,392
Look like

2263
01:59:55,648 --> 01:59:57,184
Squires building fire

2264
01:59:57,440 --> 01:59:59,744
And then further

2265
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:04,096
If you fold up a dollar bill just the right way you can also make it

2266
02:00:04,352 --> 02:00:09,984
Because it's more fun

2267
02:00:10,240 --> 02:00:11,776
You do this with foreign currency

2268
02:00:12,032 --> 02:00:16,640
Cuz there's some I don't know what I don't remember what country is a show

2269
02:00:17,664 --> 02:00:18,944
It looks like two

2270
02:00:19,200 --> 02:00:22,272
Badgers

2271
02:00:25,600 --> 02:00:30,976
You fold up money bunch of different ways you can create a bunch of pictures that you want

2272
02:00:31,232 --> 02:00:31,744
So

2273
02:00:32,000 --> 02:00:33,024
Maga

2274
02:00:33,536 --> 02:00:37,632
Got woken up by folding goddamn $20 bill

2275
02:00:42,752 --> 02:00:48,384
Any better I would argue that like if he is a millennial

2276
02:00:51,200 --> 02:00:54,016
Is Bear Creek a great now

2277
02:00:54,272 --> 02:00:57,088
If that's if that's the way you want to do it if that's your example

2278
02:00:57,856 --> 02:01:01,440
Do not desecrate so here's the last clip where a little bit more from Maga

2279
02:01:01,952 --> 02:01:03,744
Do you know how Einstein found

2280
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:04,768
The

2281
02:01:05,024 --> 02:01:07,328
General theory of relativity

2282
02:01:07,584 --> 02:01:09,120
The special theory of relativity

2283
02:01:09,376 --> 02:01:09,888
Was

2284
02:01:11,680 --> 02:01:14,240
He folded up a silver

2285
02:01:14,752 --> 02:01:15,520
That

2286
02:01:16,032 --> 02:01:17,824
Was actually

2287
02:01:20,640 --> 02:01:22,688
She might folded it up and then

2288
02:01:22,944 --> 02:01:27,040
I heard travel Texas

2289
02:01:27,296 --> 02:01:28,320
Is he swallowed a nickel

2290
02:01:43,680 --> 02:01:44,960
My

2291
02:01:45,472 --> 02:01:51,616
I just did that cuz we have to get the news out there and hand we have to to report what's going on I mean

2292
02:01:53,920 --> 02:02:00,064
Admitted that they had intelligent life small human being alien beings here on Earth

2293
02:02:00,576 --> 02:02:06,720
Now you're in my territory troll that's how it was born

2294
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:12,608
Okay. All right path

2295
02:02:15,168 --> 02:02:21,312
Alex I think you might be getting trolled in this interview I'm not really sure I can be considered.

2296
02:02:23,616 --> 02:02:25,152
The stuff you says it's really just like

2297
02:02:25,664 --> 02:02:28,736
If look through the prism of someone just trying to

2298
02:02:28,992 --> 02:02:31,296
Use Alex Jones's platform in order to

2299
02:02:31,552 --> 02:02:36,928
To create a name for themselves in terms of agreeing with Alex about everything

2300
02:02:41,536 --> 02:02:43,584
And then the troll piece of it could be

2301
02:02:43,840 --> 02:02:49,984
I got woken up by folding a $20 bill allowing that to be on his show anywhere.

2302
02:02:52,544 --> 02:02:54,336
Giving recognition of that

2303
02:02:54,592 --> 02:02:56,384
He's done to my Capri

2304
02:02:57,408 --> 02:02:57,920
That's nice

2305
02:02:58,176 --> 02:03:04,320
Thank you Bill.

2306
02:03:04,576 --> 02:03:05,344
I started this

2307
02:03:05,600 --> 02:03:07,136
Community of the news on NASA just

2308
02:03:07,392 --> 02:03:10,720
Humanoid aliens been here in the past

2309
02:03:11,488 --> 02:03:12,768
That story is not

2310
02:03:14,048 --> 02:03:15,072
Didn't answer

2311
02:03:15,328 --> 02:03:18,656
Stop know there was a guy who works for NASA

2312
02:03:18,912 --> 02:03:20,192
Who gave a speech to study

2313
02:03:20,448 --> 02:03:21,984
Search for extraterrestrial intelligence

2314
02:03:22,240 --> 02:03:26,592
Yeah there was a write-up of a species arguing

2315
02:03:26,848 --> 02:03:27,360
DIA

2316
02:03:27,616 --> 02:03:28,640
That perhaps

2317
02:03:29,664 --> 02:03:30,432
The idea

2318
02:03:31,968 --> 02:03:32,992
Aliens have been here

2319
02:03:33,248 --> 02:03:33,760
Before

2320
02:03:34,016 --> 02:03:36,064
Isn't something we should discount out of

2321
02:03:36,832 --> 02:03:39,136
If you want to study those things

2322
02:03:39,392 --> 02:03:45,024
There's no reason not to apply the same scientific rigor.

2323
02:03:45,280 --> 02:03:47,840
Scientist goes in front of other scientists and says

2324
02:03:48,096 --> 02:03:50,400
Maybe we should do science ideas scientist life

2325
02:03:50,656 --> 02:03:51,936
But

2326
02:03:52,192 --> 02:03:56,032
Did they do they're better than Project Camelot

2327
02:03:56,288 --> 02:03:57,824
So what was

2328
02:03:58,080 --> 02:03:59,104
Was on the one hand

2329
02:03:59,360 --> 02:04:00,128
People who are arguing

2330
02:04:00,384 --> 02:04:01,408
The aliens have been

2331
02:04:01,664 --> 02:04:02,688
He should adopt scientific

2332
02:04:02,944 --> 02:04:03,456
Method

2333
02:04:03,712 --> 02:04:04,224
And if

2334
02:04:04,480 --> 02:04:05,248
X

2335
02:04:05,760 --> 02:04:06,528
You are studying these sorts

2336
02:04:07,296 --> 02:04:10,624
Shouldn't dismiss out-of-hand things that look absurd

2337
02:04:10,880 --> 02:04:11,648
But should

2338
02:04:11,904 --> 02:04:13,952
Humor them and treat them with the same

2339
02:04:16,256 --> 02:04:18,048
You know

2340
02:04:18,560 --> 02:04:20,096
There was a write-up of

2341
02:04:20,352 --> 02:04:21,376
Of his

2342
02:04:22,656 --> 02:04:23,168
Andy got

2343
02:04:23,424 --> 02:04:24,448
Misrepresented

2344
02:04:24,704 --> 02:04:26,496
Thai places like Fox News

2345
02:04:26,752 --> 02:04:29,056
And also

2346
02:04:29,312 --> 02:04:33,408
A comment at all journalists ecclesiastical reported

2347
02:04:33,664 --> 02:04:36,736
NASA scientist says that aliens probably

2348
02:04:36,992 --> 02:04:43,136
And now Margot Robbie Margot I control is coming on Alex's shows like we got to get the news out to here

2349
02:04:44,160 --> 02:04:47,488
Maybe a humanoid intelligent aliens been here in the past

2350
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:49,280
Like a dumb game of telephone

2351
02:04:49,792 --> 02:04:50,304
It's awesome

2352
02:04:51,072 --> 02:04:51,584
These people are f******

2353
02:04:53,120 --> 02:04:54,144
Guys are having a great time

2354
02:04:55,168 --> 02:04:55,936
Until they're not

2355
02:04:56,192 --> 02:04:57,216
Which Rodger probably won't be

2356
02:04:57,984 --> 02:04:59,776
But like what we have here

2357
02:05:00,032 --> 02:05:02,080
The big

2358
02:05:02,592 --> 02:05:04,384
Of this episode

2359
02:05:04,896 --> 02:05:05,408
Kind of fun

2360
02:05:05,664 --> 02:05:06,176
Is it

2361
02:05:06,432 --> 02:05:06,944
Remember

2362
02:05:07,200 --> 02:05:08,992
There's an episode in 2050

2363
02:05:09,504 --> 02:05:10,272
Where Alex

2364
02:05:10,528 --> 02:05:11,040
Was like

2365
02:05:11,808 --> 02:05:13,856
Today I'm going to jump the shark

2366
02:05:14,368 --> 02:05:15,904
I am going to

2367
02:05:16,160 --> 02:05:22,304
Yeah yeah I remember that intentionally make an argument to bait the media into covering me

2368
02:05:22,560 --> 02:05:26,912
In order to start the conversation

2369
02:05:27,168 --> 02:05:29,728
I want all Muslims taken out of the country

2370
02:05:29,984 --> 02:05:31,520
Vlog van

2371
02:05:31,776 --> 02:05:35,104
Right interesting Arc to me

2372
02:05:35,360 --> 02:05:36,896
Of like Alex thinking

2373
02:05:37,408 --> 02:05:38,944
We're going to misrepresent him

2374
02:05:39,712 --> 02:05:42,784
And then accidentally kind of stating his own position

2375
02:05:43,040 --> 02:05:44,832
Yep it was a very weird

2376
02:05:49,184 --> 02:05:49,952
Relationship

2377
02:05:50,464 --> 02:05:51,744
I had the same sort of feel to me

2378
02:05:52,256 --> 02:05:52,768
I was like this

2379
02:05:53,536 --> 02:05:55,584
Alex's now laying down

2380
02:05:55,840 --> 02:05:57,632
What the groundwork of the episode

2381
02:05:58,400 --> 02:05:59,680
He's laid out the

2382
02:06:00,192 --> 02:06:00,960
The blueprint

2383
02:06:01,472 --> 02:06:06,848
Yeah I have a bunch of stories that are going to build to a bigger store once again just a line

2384
02:06:10,176 --> 02:06:11,968
He's a bunch of stories that are going to be

2385
02:06:12,480 --> 02:06:14,528
They're going to add up to something bigger than the Sun

2386
02:06:15,040 --> 02:06:17,344
The only reason that you know not

2387
02:06:18,624 --> 02:06:19,136
You don't have to

2388
02:06:19,392 --> 02:06:20,416
Gifted

2389
02:06:20,672 --> 02:06:22,464
Read between the lines

2390
02:06:22,720 --> 02:06:26,816
Of his own story

2391
02:06:27,072 --> 02:06:28,864
So in presenting

2392
02:06:29,120 --> 02:06:29,888
His b*******

2393
02:06:30,144 --> 02:06:30,912
2 stories

2394
02:06:34,496 --> 02:06:36,288
What you end up with is him

2395
02:06:36,544 --> 02:06:37,312
Just trying

2396
02:06:38,080 --> 02:06:38,592
Demon eyes

2397
02:06:39,360 --> 02:06:39,872
Millennials

2398
02:06:40,128 --> 02:06:41,920
I tried to say that they're the ones

2399
02:06:42,176 --> 02:06:43,200
We're going to take away all the

2400
02:06:44,992 --> 02:06:45,760
People Like Us

2401
02:06:46,016 --> 02:06:48,832
Moral people the producers in society

2402
02:06:49,600 --> 02:06:50,112
Exactly

2403
02:06:50,368 --> 02:06:52,416
So that is what the end result

2404
02:06:53,184 --> 02:06:53,696
Blueprint

2405
02:06:54,208 --> 02:06:55,488
That's the building that he was

2406
02:06:55,744 --> 02:06:56,768
He was trying to

2407
02:06:57,024 --> 02:06:57,536
Direct

2408
02:06:58,304 --> 02:06:58,816
Edwin

2409
02:06:59,328 --> 02:07:00,864
You apply the exact same

2410
02:07:02,912 --> 02:07:03,424
He was doing

2411
02:07:04,960 --> 02:07:05,472
Constellation

2412
02:07:06,240 --> 02:07:07,776
I can take new stories

2413
02:07:08,288 --> 02:07:09,824
Alex has been kicked off YouTube

2414
02:07:10,080 --> 02:07:11,616
Alex has been kicked off Twitter

2415
02:07:12,128 --> 02:07:13,920
Alex's audiences diminishing

2416
02:07:14,688 --> 02:07:17,248
Alex is trying to sell everything in his f****** Warehouse

2417
02:07:17,760 --> 02:07:18,528
Alex's

2418
02:07:19,040 --> 02:07:20,832
Weirdly demonizing the youth

2419
02:07:21,856 --> 02:07:24,160
Hey you can do the same thing make a constellation out of it

2420
02:07:24,416 --> 02:07:25,440
Oh that points to is

2421
02:07:37,216 --> 02:07:37,728
Five finger

2422
02:07:37,984 --> 02:07:39,008
Oh yeah

2423
02:07:39,520 --> 02:07:40,032
Pentagon

2424
02:07:40,288 --> 02:07:46,432
For the week

2425
02:07:47,712 --> 02:07:52,320
Because I was an angel

2426
02:07:52,576 --> 02:07:53,344
Constellation

2427
02:07:53,600 --> 02:07:56,160
Futsal fold-up dollar bills

2428
02:07:57,696 --> 02:08:00,000
So anyway the point is I can't prove it Alex's audience

2429
02:08:02,816 --> 02:08:08,960
You think this thing is him I can do a better job of making an argument

2430
02:08:09,216 --> 02:08:11,008
That explains his rhetoric

2431
02:08:11,264 --> 02:08:12,544
I'm just fascinated by things

2432
02:08:12,800 --> 02:08:14,592
Like when

2433
02:08:14,848 --> 02:08:15,616
I have been in

2434
02:08:15,872 --> 02:08:16,896
This game

2435
02:08:17,152 --> 02:08:18,944
For as long as I have and I can like

2436
02:08:20,736 --> 02:08:23,552
I see what you doing yeah that's what it I love it

2437
02:08:23,808 --> 02:08:26,112
Pennywise

2438
02:08:26,368 --> 02:08:32,512
Look it's a weird completely useless gifts outside of this show I feel like

2439
02:08:32,768 --> 02:08:34,560
I should have been able to gather

2440
02:08:34,816 --> 02:08:37,888
Based on the amount of time that I have been playing this game

2441
02:08:38,400 --> 02:08:40,448
Somehow I am still

2442
02:08:40,704 --> 02:08:41,984
Delightfully ignorant

2443
02:08:42,240 --> 02:08:45,056
Once again proving that I know nothing about Alex

2444
02:08:45,824 --> 02:08:46,848
But at the same time

2445
02:08:47,104 --> 02:08:48,128
I guess I would say

2446
02:08:48,384 --> 02:08:49,152
If you had the

2447
02:08:49,408 --> 02:08:50,176
Couple hours

2448
02:08:50,432 --> 02:08:50,944
To sit around and

2449
02:08:51,200 --> 02:08:51,968
Think about

2450
02:08:53,248 --> 02:08:53,760
Who sings this

2451
02:08:54,016 --> 02:08:55,040
This

2452
02:08:56,320 --> 02:08:57,600
These stories aren't really

2453
02:08:57,856 --> 02:08:58,368
Connected

2454
02:08:59,904 --> 02:09:00,416
What's the point here

2455
02:09:00,928 --> 02:09:01,696
Dstat out

2456
02:09:02,464 --> 02:09:03,232
Create

2457
02:09:03,744 --> 02:09:04,256
Dispatched

2458
02:09:06,048 --> 02:09:10,656
Fear and misery and paranoia but there was a specific track he was trying to go on which was

2459
02:09:10,912 --> 02:09:11,936
I have these stories

2460
02:09:12,192 --> 02:09:14,752
You don't realize are connected but actually are

2461
02:09:15,520 --> 02:09:16,544
That is not something

2462
02:09:16,800 --> 02:09:18,080
Somebody fumbling around accident

2463
02:09:18,848 --> 02:09:19,872
And I see that from

2464
02:09:20,384 --> 02:09:21,664
Enough to know I don't

2465
02:09:22,432 --> 02:09:22,944
That it is

2466
02:09:23,200 --> 02:09:23,712
Just some

2467
02:09:24,224 --> 02:09:25,504
Stupid person I think someone

2468
02:09:27,296 --> 02:09:29,344
Inveterate liar

2469
02:09:31,392 --> 02:09:32,416
But who trying to

2470
02:09:33,696 --> 02:09:34,208
I don't I don't know

2471
02:09:34,464 --> 02:09:35,488
I don't I don't know if we're going to go

2472
02:09:35,744 --> 02:09:36,256
Get to the bottom of any

2473
02:09:36,768 --> 02:09:37,280
But

2474
02:09:38,816 --> 02:09:40,352
Hi all my all my point is this

2475
02:09:40,864 --> 02:09:41,376
I enjoyed

2476
02:09:42,144 --> 02:09:43,936
No no

2477
02:09:44,192 --> 02:09:45,216
That's

2478
02:09:46,240 --> 02:09:47,008
Kind of why

2479
02:09:47,264 --> 02:09:48,288
I still find

2480
02:09:51,616 --> 02:09:54,176
It does kind of Boggle my mind from time to time like

2481
02:09:54,432 --> 02:09:56,992
Why am I feeling

2482
02:09:59,808 --> 02:10:02,624
It is a never-ending onion

2483
02:10:02,880 --> 02:10:03,904
But I think

2484
02:10:04,160 --> 02:10:04,672
Reflect

2485
02:10:05,440 --> 02:10:06,720
Because a lesser

2486
02:10:07,232 --> 02:10:07,744
Talented

2487
02:10:08,000 --> 02:10:09,024
Persimmon Alex would have

2488
02:10:09,280 --> 02:10:10,304
Said the n-word on air

2489
02:10:13,120 --> 02:10:14,400
Given up so much

2490
02:10:14,912 --> 02:10:15,936
That they would be like

2491
02:10:16,704 --> 02:10:17,984
I need some could argue that

2492
02:10:18,240 --> 02:10:19,776
Is Sandy Hook behavior is

2493
02:10:20,800 --> 02:10:21,824
Like the example of

2494
02:10:24,384 --> 02:10:25,152
Alex

2495
02:10:30,016 --> 02:10:31,296
At least in the hundreds

2496
02:10:31,552 --> 02:10:32,064
100

2497
02:10:32,576 --> 02:10:33,344
Devours that I've listened

2498
02:10:35,904 --> 02:10:37,184
Outside if I guess

2499
02:10:37,440 --> 02:10:37,952
The couplings

2500
02:10:38,464 --> 02:10:39,232
Do you like skulls

2501
02:10:39,488 --> 02:10:40,000
Zimbabwe Road

2502
02:10:41,024 --> 02:10:43,584
Yeah that one

2503
02:10:43,840 --> 02:10:44,864
Muslim girls at a pool

2504
02:10:45,120 --> 02:10:45,632

2505
02:10:46,144 --> 02:10:47,168

But like

2507
02:10:50,240 --> 02:10:50,752
Done

2508
02:10:51,776 --> 02:10:53,056
It is another version of

2509
02:10:53,824 --> 02:10:57,664
But he's able to be his racist overtly super

2510
02:10:58,176 --> 02:10:58,688
Spectacular

2511
02:10:58,944 --> 02:10:59,712
So that keeps

2512
02:11:00,224 --> 02:11:00,736
Interested

2513
02:11:00,992 --> 02:11:01,760
Is always

2514
02:11:02,784 --> 02:11:04,832
When are you going to just say the n word

2515
02:11:05,088 --> 02:11:07,648
It's always just do it

2516
02:11:08,416 --> 02:11:08,928
Yes

2517
02:11:09,184 --> 02:11:10,208

What do you see

2522
02:11:22,496 --> 02:11:23,008
The shape of it

2523
02:11:23,264 --> 02:11:24,032
For what it is

2524
02:11:24,288 --> 02:11:25,056
But

2525
02:11:27,104 --> 02:11:31,456
Knowledge buy.com social media

To the end of this episode in Jordan what's on my mind

2530
02:12:06,272 --> 02:12:08,064
Maga Titan

2531
02:12:08,576 --> 02:12:10,624
Play himself out a little bit

2532
02:12:10,880 --> 02:12:11,648
The by explaining

2533
02:12:11,904 --> 02:12:12,928
He's a troll

2534
02:12:13,440 --> 02:12:14,208
Meme kind of guy

2535
02:12:14,720 --> 02:12:20,864
Almost almost there. I really just like the antagonizing

2536
02:12:21,120 --> 02:12:24,192
Talk around it's not going to kill somebody

2537
02:12:28,032 --> 02:12:30,080
