1
00:00:04,352 --> 00:00:05,120
Alex

2
00:00:05,376 --> 00:00:06,144
Birthstone colors

3
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:18,944
I can understand why that would happen

4
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:25,344
That's also a very relevant possibility we are disgusting human beings like to sit around

5
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:29,952
But Alex Jones is there a reason why you

6
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:34,304
Is there a reason why we would record to episodes

7
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:40,704
Work done some sort of like

8
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:44,032
Travelers style slash

9
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:46,080
Stephen King Style

10
00:00:46,592 --> 00:00:47,872
The reason is

11
00:00:48,128 --> 00:00:49,664
Play the world is

12
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,480
The terrifying place I happen to know a lot about Alex Jones

13
00:00:52,736 --> 00:00:54,016
And I see it is my duty to

14
00:00:54,272 --> 00:00:56,576
To teach you who knows nothing about Alex Jones

15
00:00:57,344 --> 00:00:58,624
About this before it's too late

16
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:00,672
That makes me sound like a buffoon as child

17
00:01:00,928 --> 00:01:02,720
Do you know what I'm saying

18
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:09,120
But does not Alex, I happen to believe it's one of the most important areas of State in our time and

19
00:01:09,376 --> 00:01:12,960
Whether that's true

20
00:01:13,472 --> 00:01:16,544
You know what here's the other thing

21
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:17,568
But

22
00:01:17,824 --> 00:01:19,872
Even harder we shouldn't be looking for any kind of

23
00:01:20,128 --> 00:01:20,896
Media grants

24
00:01:21,408 --> 00:01:23,712
Let me tell you something you and me

25
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:30,112
Adjunct professors I like this

26
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:32,416
Alex Jones

27
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:35,232
I think we could teach that at a junior college

28
00:01:35,488 --> 00:01:36,256
I bet we could

29
00:01:36,512 --> 00:01:39,072
I bet we could get at least twenty grand for it

30
00:01:39,328 --> 00:01:41,376
Do a little bit of research

31
00:01:53,920 --> 00:02:00,064
And if you would like to do that you could become a policy if you already donated and you want to bump that number up you could be

32
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,368
Become a foreign policy wonk

33
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:09,024
Like a real one of our new to Chicago

34
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:15,424
And we had a great time hanging out with him over the weekend it was a blast

35
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,192
Over the next day

36
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:21,056
Very but like to give a shout out to our new foreign policy want what's going on out there

37
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:23,616
Four Star

38
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:25,664
Aprilia

39
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:29,760
Yeah super cool dude

40
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:31,296
One of these

41
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:37,696
Very very few policy want to have everything we do stamp

42
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:41,024
I apologize

43
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:46,912
If you would like

44
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:47,936
Peewee do stand-up

45
00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:52,032
Follow me on I don't have any social media and I do not post any of my

46
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:55,616
I will find a video and send it to you

47
00:02:55,872 --> 00:03:00,480
Please don't know for real it was super fun to hang out and meet someone who likes

48
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:06,880
Michonne is a very interesting guy very nice guy ever in town

49
00:03:07,136 --> 00:03:12,000
Even if you are a serial killer weenie like

50
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:14,560
Well this is a bad way to go

51
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:21,216
We would be so I don't think we need a serial killer in private anything like that

52
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:25,824
It's great it's so it's really cool to me that you know we have

53
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:27,104
Cool fan

54
00:03:27,616 --> 00:03:30,944
Everybody that I've interacted with online and I'll chat rooms and live shows

55
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,248
Girl super cool and not dick

56
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:38,624
Even to people like sometimes we get Alex Jones room and then

57
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:45,280
I like that I like that they're not assholes to people and I think we've done a good job reasonable fanbase

58
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:46,304
Think we have any

59
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,120
Reasonable intelligent fan base

60
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:55,520
Reply not so much larger

61
00:03:55,776 --> 00:04:01,920
Is the price we pay

62
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:02,688
Running low

63
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:03,712
If we pics

64
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:06,016
We would be much better off

65
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:07,296
Jordan

66
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:09,088
We're going to be going over

67
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,904
Is a little bit of a look

68
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:14,720
Alex Jones and his relationship with Russian

69
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:17,280
Because I take out a telescope

70
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:18,559
Alright alright

71
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:21,631
I might not understand the bit

72
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:23,679
I wanted to get a look at

73
00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:25,471
Alright screw you

74
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:29,823
Screw you Dad don't you dare tickets

75
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:31,103
Hazard lyrics

76
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:32,127
Explain the

77
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,943
Moderately terrible B I just gave

78
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:35,711
What I do

79
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:36,735
Jordan

80
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:38,527
And I watched

81
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:39,295
The number of in

82
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:40,575
Instances of Alex Jones

83
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:42,111
Disappearances on RT

84
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:44,159
And then also I have

85
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:46,719
Put together a montage

86
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:47,999
Alex Jones

87
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:49,279
Songs when he was a gas

88
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:51,071
Alexander Dugan

89
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:53,375
Right after Donald Trump

90
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:56,447
I'm not sure what a lot of this

91
00:04:56,703 --> 00:04:57,215
Proves

92
00:04:57,727 --> 00:04:59,007
But it's an interesting glimpse

93
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:01,055
And I want to add this glimpse

94
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:02,591
Into

95
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:04,383
Even before we get started

96
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:05,151
Yeah

97
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:07,199
One of the things that I learned

98
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:08,223
From this

99
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:09,247
Exploration

100
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:12,063
Is it there's a high incidence

101
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:14,367
Alex Jones regular

102
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:16,415
Who are also regulars on RT

103
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:18,463
People like

104
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:19,487
Paul Craig Roberts

105
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:21,023
Is on all the time

106
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:22,559
Gerald Celente

107
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:24,095
Peter Schiff

108
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:25,375
These people

109
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:27,935
Often go on in RT

110
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:28,959
And make

111
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:31,263
Barely anti-American argument

112
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:34,847
Like listen to this to start with a clip of Paul Craig Roberts

113
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:37,151
Who's the guy who is on Alex

114
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:40,223
The show very regularly

115
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:42,527
And I would say this is just talkingshit on America

116
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:43,807
So

117
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:47,391
The American economy is just

118
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:49,439
Play Third World economy

119
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:50,719
In which

120
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:52,511
The only jobs available

121
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:54,303
Are domestic service

122
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:56,095
Such as

123
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:58,399
Starburst waitresses and bartenders

124
00:05:58,911 --> 00:06:00,959
There's probably more than that

125
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:05,311
A superpower

126
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:08,127
Some extent

127
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:10,687
Well I mean

128
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:14,783
Using his particular example

129
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:15,551
I do thank you

130
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:16,319
Correcto

131
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:18,111
I don't I don't I do not agree

132
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:24,511
We're descending into a third world country when you look at our infant mortality rate going up you got to be like

133
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:29,375
Maybe some arguments we had though because of the vaccine

134
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:30,143
Sent right

135
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:32,959
You got me

136
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:34,495
Here's the thing

137
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:36,031
Our economy isn't

138
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:37,823
Descending into a third world

139
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:41,407
Steadily better since 2000

140
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:43,455
That argument is

141
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:48,575
A lot of jobs that are available are in service Industries

142
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:51,903
That's mainly because manufacturing has become robotics

143
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:53,951
That's not the job

144
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:58,047
That is one Snapchat

145
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:01,375
Overly simplistic View

146
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:04,447
I don't think we're sending it to a third world economy

147
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:06,751
But we're not we're not what we were

148
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:10,335
70 years ago or whatever

149
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:13,919
That's a silly argument to be making and at the end and saying

150
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:16,223
We are this is not a superpower

151
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:19,039
Is not justifiable based on the numbers

152
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:20,319
Based on what

153
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:21,855
Examples

154
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:23,647
Think you're correct

155
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:27,231
Based on the overall reality I think you might be wrong

156
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:28,255
I think we are

157
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:33,119
I think we are watching a former superpower decline

158
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:39,775
That may be in the same way

159
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:40,799
Predicting the future

160
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:45,151
A little irresponsible

161
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:48,223
Future which I think is

162
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:53,855
But if everybody understands history you can cut things off at the pass

163
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:57,183
Right but I mean if you look at the way that Roman

164
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:58,719
Fairly similar

165
00:07:58,975 --> 00:08:02,047
There are there are some similarities

166
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:05,631
But not least to mention so many different states

167
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:06,655
With in Rome

168
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:11,519
And its outlying territories starting to break away from each other ideologically and

169
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:13,311
Really

170
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:16,639
Having these

171
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:17,407
Thoughts

172
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:20,223
You having these you know position

173
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:23,295
Yes is pretty reasonable

174
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:24,575
You know what that's fine we can

175
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:25,599
About these things

176
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:28,671
If you were to go on Russian television

177
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:30,719
Russian state-owned television

178
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:33,791
Save it America is not a superpower

179
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:36,351
And descending into a third world country

180
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:37,375
It has a different

181
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:38,143
Flare tool

182
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:39,167
To me a little bit

183
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:41,215
Wealthy but the way that I would

184
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:42,495
Is that

185
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:43,519
,

186
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:45,055
Like you

187
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:51,455
Is Russia interested interesting strategy

188
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:58,623
I realize this is a little bit of a small example but it is the trend among all of his

189
00:08:59,135 --> 00:09:00,159
But end up going on

190
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:03,231

195
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:18,079

That has a hard right bed

200
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:29,343
You would definitely not give

201
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:30,879
Equal view to climate change

202
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:32,159

Well they were not selling as many colorful suits

221
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:23,871
That's that was that right

222
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:26,175

Make a jack on the order of Pearl Harbor

254
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:55,007
You know it's real when you use the word dastardly

255
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:56,543
Used to do this

256
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:58,847

00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:14,719
Who do you think is talking about when he says the foreign media I was watching

262
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:15,743
You

263
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:22,399
Are modern-day the 21st century

264
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:25,471

Sneak attack

267
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:33,407
And our leaders went on television and said that we would have to have a new Cold War

268
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:36,479
It was such an insult the American people's intelligence

269
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:41,087
That the United States back Georgia and I apologized

270
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:44,415
Like this

271
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:45,183
This is not

You have a new Cold War proof in Georgia

276
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:58,751
So no more sneak attacks can be long

277
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:01,823
Because the dictator in fraud

278
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:03,615

00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:19,743
Don't want this one

290
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:36,639
They're destroying our freedoms

291
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:39,967
Coming after the Free Press and feather using NATO

292
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:40,991
Expansion

293
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:43,295
The way to widen the war

294
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:46,879
Central Asia and then to the west through Eastern Europe

295
00:13:47,135 --> 00:13:48,159
In Central Europe

296
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:49,439
Can I really appreciate

00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:50,463
Vodka

298
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:53,023
Has been restrained in all of this

299
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:54,303
Jesus Christ

300
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:57,631
Tesla

301
00:13:58,143 --> 00:13:58,655
Narratively

302
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:04,543
Did the leader in Georgia that he's referring

303
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:07,871
Western sympathetic

304
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:08,639
Power

305
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:10,175
Not a dick

306
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:11,199
Dictator

307
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:14,527
He was leaning towards trying to join the UN

308
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:16,575
And you wanted

309
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:18,623
Protection from that that

310
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:19,903
Guide

311
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:26,303
Didn't want to have that guy anywhere near us

312
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:32,959
Didn't want to be there because it got they took away from there

313
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:38,847
Competition

314
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:43,967
It's all exactly

315
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:49,855
It's all a very very simple calculus never have been allowed in the UN

316
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:50,879
Because Russia can

317
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:51,903
Negotiate on this

318
00:14:54,463 --> 00:14:58,047
And be like hey and other members going

319
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:00,351
And you guys don't have the balls to say

320
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:03,167
And other members of the security Council

321
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:06,239
That would being discussed the idea of putting forward a map

322
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:07,263
Of them join

323
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:12,383
Their position was insult

324
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:13,919
Or an attack on Russia

325
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:20,063
That didn't move forward but what did move

326
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:22,367
Quote undo attack on Russia

327
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:28,767
No it's so we have we have this we have this situation where there are areas

328
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:31,327
They used to be part of the Soviet Union

329
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:34,655
And some of the people there identify with Russia as eight

330
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:35,679
Bordering

331
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:36,703
But it's

332
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:37,983
It's not a part of Russia

333
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:39,263
That's not their country

334
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:41,567
The lines are very clear about

335
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:42,847
National sovereignty

336
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:44,639
It's a ghost

337
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:45,919
To Alex's like

338
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:48,223
His belief that secession is okay

339
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:53,599
Right now it's significant

340
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:57,183
Huge blind spot

341
00:15:57,439 --> 00:15:58,463
Because I never

342
00:15:58,719 --> 00:15:59,487
Really even thought about

343
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:02,047
How were the borders drawn up

344
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:04,095
Immediately after the fall of the Soviet

345
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:09,471
Were they pre Soviet Union Borders or District

346
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:13,311
Everything right

347
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:19,199
Well in the 10th Century for the first time in merge doesn't

348
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:21,759
Concept in the territories were the Georgian language

349
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:22,783
Refused to perform Christi

350
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:26,367
Chicken ritual

351
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:30,463
So there's this

352
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:37,887
The independent Democratic Republic of Georgia was invaded by the Red Army in 1921 in Soviet government wasn't

353
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:43,263
Installed the government of Soviet Georgia created an autonomous administrative units for the train

354
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:44,287
Caucasian

355
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:46,079
April 9th

356
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:47,103
22 called

357
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:48,127
Self-obsession

358
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:48,895
Autonomous

359
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:49,663
O'Brien

360
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:52,991
Such as Steven F

361
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:54,015
Lance motherfolk

362
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:57,343
Believe that the Bolsheviks granted us autonomy to the accession

363
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:59,647
In exchange for their help in fighting the Democratic

364
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:00,415
Republic of Georgia

365
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:03,999
Tempe area had never been a separate entity prior to the Russian invasion

366
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:06,559
South ossetia

367
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:07,327
Subway

368
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:12,447
So the Democratic Republic of the Soviet Union

369
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:17,311
With all of the Soviet territory split up after that but

370
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:23,711
They predate it so there's that I don't know all the boundaries of all these other countries but there's that

371
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:24,735
You're going to have to

372
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:26,015
People who identify

373
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:29,343
In the Soviet Union never lived with anything else

374
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:35,743
Sure like from when they were born they've always been

375
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:37,023
There's that

376
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:40,095
So let's say a situation where I was a sneaky

377
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:41,119
Sneaky power

378
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:43,679
And they were trying to bolster the

379
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:44,959
Credibility

380
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:46,751
The remnants of the

381
00:17:47,007 --> 00:17:49,055
Confederacy in our country

382
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:54,175
Could be like you know Alabama was really more importantly part of the Confederacy

383
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:59,551
It wasn't really part of the United States

384
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:01,343
Just ended with us becoming two step

385
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:06,463
Countries plenty of people in the woods North America

386
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:12,095
Incredibly complicated Alex went on Russian television

387
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:14,399
Supported the exact Russian lion

388
00:18:15,423 --> 00:18:17,215
And that's kind of common

389
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:18,239
Kind of common

390
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:24,127
Is one of the other things that it is a big thorn

391
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:25,919
A lot of a territory that it lost

392
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:28,735
Union brokop power

393
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:33,855
A lot of the money that they could be making for oil reserves and thread

394
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:36,927
It is a complete disaster for them

395
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:38,207
Because

396
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:42,047
Encroaching

397
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:45,887
No so here's another clip of Alex on nrt

398
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:47,167
Talkabouttd

399
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:50,751
What would you do to fix it is it possible to feel

400
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:52,031
You know

401
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:53,567
Is there any solution

402
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:00,991
For fraud

403
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:02,527
No it wasn't

404
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:08,415
Did they write that down also

405
00:19:12,255 --> 00:19:13,023
And show you

406
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:17,119
Goodwill

407
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:18,143
Used to set up

408
00:19:19,423 --> 00:19:20,447
World government

409
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:21,983
It's now come out

410
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:26,847
Not really setup

411
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:34,271
Operative expression

412
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:41,183
Yeah that's really the mission that is set up for was let's not have another world war

413
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:44,255
Guess what we're all hanging out

414
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:46,815
Come on over we'll talk it out

415
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:47,839
Maybe you guys want

416
00:19:48,095 --> 00:19:49,375
Right and even with

417
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:50,655
Whatever excuse

418
00:19:50,911 --> 00:19:53,215
Scream nationalist version of the world Alex

419
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:54,495
Wants to create

420
00:19:54,751 --> 00:20:00,895
And these other people want to create the garage there has to be

421
00:20:01,151 --> 00:20:02,943
Coordinate your dump

422
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:05,503
Because even if you have these nationalist entity

423
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:09,599
Unilateral treaties with each other

424
00:20:09,855 --> 00:20:14,207
Eventually you're going to butt up against each other eventually there's going to be some need

425
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:17,535
For collective bargaining with each other cuz otherwise

426
00:20:18,047 --> 00:20:19,839
Nothing will ever get done

427
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:26,239
Guess what once that happens if you have this National Collection of nation that are getting together on

428
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:30,591
Slightly different name for the exact same

429
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:32,383
Is there will be inadequate

430
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:36,735
There will be times when atrocities take place and they're supposed to stop it

431
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:39,295
That's going to happen no matter what

432
00:20:39,551 --> 00:20:45,695
Yes

433
00:20:45,951 --> 00:20:47,743
The situation

434
00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:55,423
Countries

435
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:57,727
Eventually you're going to get into dispute

436
00:20:57,983 --> 00:21:00,799
Just like we talked about with the Soviet Union

437
00:21:01,055 --> 00:21:02,591
Your American National

438
00:21:04,383 --> 00:21:06,175
Mexico was part of the United

439
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:06,943
States rights

440
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:12,831
We on that territory part of the United States

441
00:21:13,087 --> 00:21:15,391
We have we have reached a stalemate

442
00:21:15,647 --> 00:21:17,952
Is Mexico in the dark

443
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:18,720
Nope

444
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:23,584
I'm afraid not know

445
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:29,984
We can't let you do that right because Mexico is too chaotic

446
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:33,568
What have you to get there

447
00:21:33,824 --> 00:21:37,664
Frankly I think in this.

448
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:39,712
It is actually a police action

449
00:21:41,504 --> 00:21:43,040
Benevolence

450
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:45,856
Nationalist United States to Annex

451
00:21:46,624 --> 00:21:49,696
Write in the same way that

452
00:21:49,952 --> 00:21:51,744
Absorb

453
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:52,768
The Ukraine

454
00:21:59,424 --> 00:22:05,568
Quick more Nazis in

455
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:07,360
Poland are the Nazis in Germany

456
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:11,712
You really brought up a

457
00:22:11,968 --> 00:22:13,248
Listen to when you get into Alex's

458
00:22:13,504 --> 00:22:14,016
Reviews about

459
00:22:14,272 --> 00:22:15,040
Do you want cuz

460
00:22:15,296 --> 00:22:17,856
What day were created for obviously

461
00:22:19,136 --> 00:22:22,208
The world will end up being

462
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:24,768
Mario donut

463
00:22:26,048 --> 00:22:27,584
So him coming on to art

464
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:31,424
And saying that the UN is beyond fixing and its only function

465
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:32,192
Corruption

466
00:22:32,704 --> 00:22:34,240
That's Manna From Heaven

467
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:35,520
People

468
00:22:35,776 --> 00:22:40,384
The propagandists that are absolutely

469
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,920
He's really describing his FIFA

470
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:44,992
You don't get that

471
00:22:45,504 --> 00:22:49,856
I didn't have time to

472
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:55,744
I'm sorry would be International apps

473
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,792
Yeah that's what they're really

474
00:22:58,048 --> 00:22:58,816
The United Nation

475
00:22:59,584 --> 00:23:03,936
As much corruption is I'm sure there isn't United Nation

476
00:23:04,192 --> 00:23:07,520
You know they they hung out with Silvio Berlusconi

477
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:09,824
Happily to report

478
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:10,848
Is making a comeback

479
00:23:12,384 --> 00:23:13,152
VIXX comeback

480
00:23:13,664 --> 00:23:14,432
Any of these

481
00:23:14,688 --> 00:23:15,456
Talking bodies

482
00:23:15,712 --> 00:23:16,224
Is it you have

483
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,528
End up lending themselves to corruption

484
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:21,088
And legitimately the only way

485
00:23:21,344 --> 00:23:22,112
That you

486
00:23:22,624 --> 00:23:23,392
Work again

487
00:23:23,648 --> 00:23:25,440
That is regulation and oversight

488
00:23:26,208 --> 00:23:27,488
The only things that are

489
00:23:27,744 --> 00:23:30,048
Goodman applying the rule of law

490
00:23:31,072 --> 00:23:35,424
You can say like we have a federal government and it's full of corruption that's why

491
00:23:36,704 --> 00:23:39,776
Look at the state government corruption

492
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:46,176
Anytime of any kind of organized power body is.

493
00:23:46,688 --> 00:23:48,224
To have those elements within it

494
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,760
So you get watchdogd

495
00:23:50,528 --> 00:23:51,296
So you get

496
00:23:51,552 --> 00:23:53,600
Strict regulation so when people are

497
00:23:53,856 --> 00:23:55,392
Caught doing things they are punished

498
00:23:55,648 --> 00:23:56,416
Appropriately

499
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,512
How do you spell that works

500
00:24:00,768 --> 00:24:03,072
How do you stop the financial crash

501
00:24:03,328 --> 00:24:04,864
2008 or the one in 90

502
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,400
29 or the one in 90

503
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:12,288
2019

504
00:24:12,544 --> 00:24:14,848
You put the people who caused it in jail forever

505
00:24:15,104 --> 00:24:15,872
Forever and ever

506
00:24:16,128 --> 00:24:22,272
Because it's cruel and unusual to use them on live TV

507
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:28,672
I mean Alex even uses the example of the bankers that

508
00:24:29,952 --> 00:24:32,768
Fox yeah and he even uses that example and I think

509
00:24:33,024 --> 00:24:34,304
Keep takes the wrong lesson from it

510
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:38,656
Necessarily

511
00:24:38,912 --> 00:24:45,056
Appropriately Iceland's economy has recovered in the

512
00:24:45,312 --> 00:24:48,896
And with appropriate oversight and

513
00:24:49,408 --> 00:24:52,224
Reasonable application of the law across-the-board

514
00:24:53,248 --> 00:24:54,016
Are possible

515
00:24:54,272 --> 00:24:56,576
On a national level

516
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:03,744
With that's what we should be working towards not the dismantling of the UN that only really serve the

517
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,280
Purposes of hostile actors

518
00:25:05,536 --> 00:25:07,072
That's not what we want

519
00:25:07,328 --> 00:25:09,120
It's it's

520
00:25:10,144 --> 00:25:13,216
Even more than that it's such a simple psychological

521
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:13,984
Concept

522
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,264
Everybody

523
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,056
He feels infinitely more safe

524
00:25:17,568 --> 00:25:18,592
When the law is applied

525
00:25:19,616 --> 00:25:20,128
It is

526
00:25:21,664 --> 00:25:22,432
Small thing but

527
00:25:22,944 --> 00:25:26,272
Think about how much more comfortable you are if the law is

528
00:25:26,528 --> 00:25:27,040
Oh

529
00:25:27,808 --> 00:25:31,648
I'm not treated any less fairly then the richest guy or the poorest

530
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,696
Yeah

531
00:25:33,952 --> 00:25:35,488
Everyday you wake up

532
00:25:35,744 --> 00:25:36,512
Far more

533
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:37,280
States

534
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:38,560
Everyday

535
00:25:38,816 --> 00:25:39,328
Every black

536
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:40,608
That wakes up

537
00:25:40,864 --> 00:25:41,632
Never worry

538
00:25:41,888 --> 00:25:42,400
About the cop

539
00:25:42,912 --> 00:25:45,728
Cuz they know they're going to be treated the same way that a billionaire

540
00:25:46,496 --> 00:25:52,640
It really seems like that would be a good way to get

541
00:25:52,896 --> 00:25:56,224
To sleep wondering if the next

542
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:02,624
Yeah also equally and I am the leader of roving band

543
00:26:03,136 --> 00:26:03,648
Coyotes

544
00:26:07,744 --> 00:26:13,120
Literally

545
00:26:13,376 --> 00:26:15,168
I have them pull

546
00:26:15,424 --> 00:26:17,728
And I just go from Fortune 500

547
00:26:17,984 --> 00:26:18,496
Company to the neck

548
00:26:19,264 --> 00:26:23,872
Hypothetical

549
00:26:24,128 --> 00:26:24,640
Sport

550
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:26,432
This next

551
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:31,808
I told you that Alex Jones a lot of his guests appear frequently as Gaston art

552
00:26:32,576 --> 00:26:35,648
In particular

553
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:37,184
Has for years

554
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:39,488
Max Keiser

555
00:26:40,256 --> 00:26:43,072
He is we know him from his cryptocurrency max bucks

556
00:26:43,328 --> 00:26:47,168
And from that one time he tried to get Alex to be reasonable

557
00:26:47,424 --> 00:26:51,776
About the idea of gun insurance and Alex freaked out at

558
00:26:52,288 --> 00:26:53,056
Here is a clip

559
00:26:53,568 --> 00:26:55,616
Is Max Keiser and Alex Jones have a conversation

560
00:26:55,872 --> 00:26:56,640
This is on our

561
00:26:56,896 --> 00:26:57,408
Texas show

562
00:26:57,664 --> 00:26:58,944
And let me tell you this

563
00:26:59,712 --> 00:27:00,992
Alex's smiling

564
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,808
The biggest smile I've ever heard

565
00:27:04,064 --> 00:27:04,832
This person

566
00:27:05,088 --> 00:27:06,880
Beginning of this clip

567
00:27:07,136 --> 00:27:08,672
When Max gives him a little bit of news

568
00:27:09,184 --> 00:27:13,792
Discuss

569
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:18,400
Crazy

570
00:27:38,112 --> 00:27:44,256
Governor's dinner

571

00:28:25,728 --> 00:28:28,288
He made a picture of yourself on a horse

574
00:28:28,544 --> 00:28:31,360
Turn off Wi-Fi

575
00:28:31,616 --> 00:28:35,200
Much like calling Obama

576
00:28:35,456 --> 00:28:35,968
Sure

577
00:28:43,392 --> 00:28:47,744
Heterosexual and so therefore

578
00:28:50,304 --> 00:28:53,632
Conair

579
00:29:02,336 --> 00:29:04,896
Especially in Britain

580
00:29:05,152 --> 00:29:11,296
Class B classified as

581
00:29:14,624 --> 00:29:20,768
He's bringing peace around the world he's a Statesman piano and and so have a Russian Asian

582
00:29:21,024 --> 00:29:25,120
The greatest

583
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,168
Alex Warren

584
00:29:27,424 --> 00:29:28,192
Has completely

585
00:29:28,448 --> 00:29:28,960
Stop listening

586
00:29:29,216 --> 00:29:32,288
The moment he heard Putin

587
00:29:32,544 --> 00:29:33,568
Says hi

588
00:29:33,824 --> 00:29:39,968
I am just going to be the happiest school girl in the world me put up a picture where I am

589
00:29:40,224 --> 00:29:42,784
Maybe he'll see this note

590
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:50,464
Do you like Alex Jones

591
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:51,744
Did about Planet of the Apes

592
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,816
I guess they did another parody picture of something with Planet of the Apes

593
00:29:56,096 --> 00:30:02,240
The person Scrolls down immediately has to get off the Google image search

594
00:30:02,496 --> 00:30:06,848
Bunch of Life ones with crosses through stars of David

595
00:30:07,104 --> 00:30:13,248
Ono Ono

596
00:30:13,504 --> 00:30:14,272
The subjects text

597
00:30:14,528 --> 00:30:18,880
We don't want to air that we're aware of how people are audio.

598
00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:21,184
I mean like

599
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:23,744
It went when we really get down to he's beaming

600
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,280
When New Year's Day

601
00:30:25,536 --> 00:30:27,584
Like someone wants to say hi

602
00:30:28,096 --> 00:30:29,632
Wants to come out and talk about hunting

603
00:30:30,656 --> 00:30:31,424
Whatever the fog lamp

604
00:30:32,448 --> 00:30:35,008
That's just indicative to me of how

605
00:30:35,264 --> 00:30:35,776
The most days

606
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:38,592
Is it

607
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:44,736
South of Section 8 is actually building

608
00:30:46,784 --> 00:30:48,064

611
00:30:58,048 --> 00:31:04,192
I would I just got conflated cuz the only thing I can think of when I hear John leguizamo's that he did that one man show where he played all the Care

612
00:31:05,216 --> 00:31:05,728
There's like a bunch

613
00:31:05,984 --> 00:31:06,496
Two characters

614
00:31:11,616 --> 00:31:14,688
Super Mario Brothers

615
00:31:14,944 --> 00:31:15,712
Best video game

616
00:31:16,224 --> 00:31:18,272
It's great

617
00:31:19,808 --> 00:31:21,856
What's the best

618
00:31:22,112 --> 00:31:24,672
John Leguizamo movies

619
00:31:27,744 --> 00:31:29,280
Where am I

620
00:31:29,536 --> 00:31:30,048
Sonaze

621
00:31:30,304 --> 00:31:30,816
It's such a

622
00:31:31,072 --> 00:31:31,584
Great movie

623
00:31:32,096 --> 00:31:34,144
You know what it do you know what happens in it

624
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,424
And you'll never believe

625
00:31:35,936 --> 00:31:36,960
Alright love you

626
00:31:37,216 --> 00:31:37,728
Keanu Reeves

627
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:40,288
He is an invincible assassin

628
00:31:40,544 --> 00:31:42,592
Do they do Gun Kata

629
00:31:43,616 --> 00:31:44,384
That's cool

630
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:45,152
Pretty close to it

631
00:31:45,408 --> 00:31:47,200
Someone else

632
00:31:47,968 --> 00:31:49,760
Monterey transmission

633
00:31:51,808 --> 00:31:52,832
We've talked about this

634
00:31:55,904 --> 00:31:56,416
After the election

635
00:31:56,672 --> 00:31:57,184
Alex Jones

636
00:31:57,696 --> 00:31:59,488
Almost immediately gets an invitation

637
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,816
Over Skype to be on Alexander Dugan show on Russian

638
00:32:04,096 --> 00:32:06,144
Let me know Alexander Dugan

639
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:09,984
Is a philosopher of note years

640
00:32:13,312 --> 00:32:15,872
I mean the only way really to put it is he is

641
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:19,456
Had a lot of foundational ideas with Auntie liberalism

642
00:32:19,712 --> 00:32:22,016
Liberalism for not talk about liberals

643
00:32:23,296 --> 00:32:25,344
The American system

644
00:32:25,856 --> 00:32:28,928
He's against anything that takes people into

645
00:32:29,184 --> 00:32:30,464
The collective

646
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:31,488
Or what have you

647
00:32:34,304 --> 00:32:34,816
27

648
00:32:36,864 --> 00:32:37,376
TI-84

649
00:32:39,936 --> 00:32:44,288
Retails back into a little bit of his philosophies as we go through this because

650
00:32:44,544 --> 00:32:46,848
This that we're going to play a bit of

651
00:32:47,104 --> 00:32:47,872
Alex's appearance

652
00:32:48,128 --> 00:32:48,896
Show

653
00:32:49,152 --> 00:32:50,944
I think it's fairly telling

654
00:32:53,248 --> 00:32:55,040
In the past made reference to how much

655
00:32:55,296 --> 00:32:56,832
He's getting his eyeball sucked

656
00:32:57,088 --> 00:32:59,136
On this route

657
00:32:59,392 --> 00:33:02,208
Haven't heard how much

658
00:33:02,464 --> 00:33:04,768
The entire time this is going on

659
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:07,328
Most this is going to be these Russian

660
00:33:07,584 --> 00:33:08,096
People talking

661
00:33:08,608 --> 00:33:09,376
Alex looks like he's going

662
00:33:10,144 --> 00:33:11,936
He looks thrilled

663
00:33:12,192 --> 00:33:13,984
To be getting the sort of accolades

664
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:17,568
But like you did a good job actually Alexander Dugan hire somebody

665
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,104
Found him underneath

666
00:33:20,128 --> 00:33:21,152
Okay that's possible

667
00:33:21,408 --> 00:33:22,176
Anything's possible

668
00:33:22,432 --> 00:33:23,456
You know what sound

669
00:33:23,712 --> 00:33:24,736
I do

670
00:33:28,576 --> 00:33:33,696
We have a special program today because in a few moments we are joined by a legendary American journalist

671
00:33:33,952 --> 00:33:34,720
Alex Jones

672
00:33:35,744 --> 00:33:39,840
But before that

673
00:33:40,096 --> 00:33:40,864
Alex Jones

674
00:33:42,144 --> 00:33:43,168
Mainstream media

675
00:33:43,424 --> 00:33:44,448
The fourth estate

676
00:33:44,704 --> 00:33:45,984
Is molding us today

677
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:49,056
Before my worldview our perception of reality

678
00:33:49,312 --> 00:33:51,872
Depending on how the mainstream media presents the information

679
00:33:52,384 --> 00:33:53,664
So just a quick

680
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:55,456
What's going on

681
00:33:56,224 --> 00:33:57,248
Visual

682
00:33:58,784 --> 00:34:01,344
Video package

683
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:02,880
About how great Alex's

684
00:34:05,184 --> 00:34:07,232
The Voice you hear is Alex's Russian

685
00:34:07,488 --> 00:34:08,256
Unemployed

686
00:34:08,768 --> 00:34:09,792
Doing the translation

687
00:34:12,096 --> 00:34:13,120
In the western world

688
00:34:13,376 --> 00:34:16,192
The dictatorship of the liberal Paradigm is all too obvious

689
00:34:16,448 --> 00:34:21,056
When it comes to the media during the u.s. presidential race

690
00:34:21,312 --> 00:34:25,920
All the big media Moguls openly supported the war criminal Hillary Clinton

691
00:34:26,432 --> 00:34:28,480
Round the Clock

692
00:34:28,992 --> 00:34:33,088
Distortions and fake poles they praised her political platform and assured

693
00:34:33,344 --> 00:34:38,208
Hurting when all the front pages of every other publication

694
00:34:38,464 --> 00:34:41,792
Portray Trump is a loser intentionally exaggerating his

695
00:34:42,048 --> 00:34:43,072
Supposed dark past

696
00:34:43,328 --> 00:34:44,864
Words taken out of context

697
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:46,656
Over and over

698
00:34:46,912 --> 00:34:47,936
On all media Outlet

699
00:34:48,192 --> 00:34:51,008
On November 8th the mainstream media operation

700
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:57,664
Already prepared their November 9th issue with Hillary's portrait on the cover and headline

701
00:34:58,688 --> 00:34:59,456
I would like

702
00:34:59,712 --> 00:35:00,992
Just to rebuttal

703
00:35:01,248 --> 00:35:02,784
Against that they also had

704
00:35:03,296 --> 00:35:04,832
Version prepared where Trump won

705
00:35:05,088 --> 00:35:06,368
That's kind of how it works it's like

706
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:10,464
Super Bowl t-shirt exactly they have to do that

707
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:15,328
Especially with an election that ends up going into like before someone can seat it was like 3 in the morning

708
00:35:15,584 --> 00:35:17,120
Getting that to press

709
00:35:17,376 --> 00:35:19,936
The idea of getting the copies out of

710
00:35:20,192 --> 00:35:21,728
Of course they had pre-made graphic

711
00:35:21,984 --> 00:35:23,264
64 everybody in something

712
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:26,848
Horse it's embarrassing in the same way as the Dewey

713
00:35:27,104 --> 00:35:30,176
Defeats Truman right kind of s*** but that's what people do

714
00:35:30,432 --> 00:35:31,968
Every single presidential

715
00:35:32,736 --> 00:35:33,504
That is ever happy

716
00:35:34,272 --> 00:35:36,832
I guarantee there is some facsimile of

717
00:35:37,344 --> 00:35:38,624
DeWitt loser winning

718
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,416
Exists

719
00:35:40,672 --> 00:35:41,696
It's not worth

720
00:35:41,952 --> 00:35:44,512
But punching about instead of a

721
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:45,280
Instead of

722
00:35:45,536 --> 00:35:46,816
Underprivileged

723
00:35:47,072 --> 00:35:47,840
Wearing

724
00:35:48,864 --> 00:35:49,888
New England Patriots

725
00:35:50,144 --> 00:35:51,424
2004 Super Bowl champs

726
00:35:51,936 --> 00:35:52,704
They're wiping their ass

727
00:35:53,728 --> 00:35:56,544
Underprivileged propaganda

728
00:35:57,824 --> 00:36:00,384
And television programs reports

729
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:03,968
Praising the lady Kingpin of the World Financial

730
00:36:04,736 --> 00:36:05,760
Something went wrong

731
00:36:06,016 --> 00:36:07,808
And all the pre-scripted news.

732
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:08,832
Turned

733
00:36:09,088 --> 00:36:09,856
Complete BS

734
00:36:10,112 --> 00:36:14,720
They put everything on the line and failed miserably the predetermined Clinton

735
00:36:15,232 --> 00:36:16,000
Suffered

736
00:36:16,256 --> 00:36:17,024
The numbers

737
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:18,048
Spoke with themselves

738
00:36:18,304 --> 00:36:19,072
Trump won

739
00:36:19,328 --> 00:36:23,680
No one in the US mainstream media believed or wanted to believe in Trump no one

740
00:36:23,936 --> 00:36:28,032
Except for those in the scientific dynamic

741
00:36:28,288 --> 00:36:34,432
Highly passionate energetic and unrelenting journalist and documentary producer Alex Jones the director and editor-in-chief

742
00:36:34,688 --> 00:36:35,712
Infowars news

743
00:36:35,968 --> 00:36:39,808
It is this journalists who had the courage to show the truth of what is really going on in the United

744
00:36:40,064 --> 00:36:44,928
Five states fighting the false Narrative of the mainstream media information

745
00:36:45,184 --> 00:36:49,792
The globalist liberal ideology prevailing in a totalitarian

746
00:36:50,048 --> 00:36:52,096
Style of the modern Western media fraud

747
00:36:52,608 --> 00:36:54,400
He reported on the financial Elite

748
00:36:54,656 --> 00:36:55,424
Their steaks

749
00:36:56,448 --> 00:36:57,472
How to choose during the election

750
00:36:57,984 --> 00:37:01,312
Alex Jones believes that behind all the world's media out

751
00:37:01,568 --> 00:37:04,128
But there's an idiot logical liberal agenda

752
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:05,152
You're welcome

753
00:37:06,944 --> 00:37:07,456
Nazi

754
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:13,600
Building a unipolar Empire

755
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:16,928
This world government manipulates all the prominent media sister

756
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:18,976
For the sake of their own personal info

757
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,840
Use all the cast

758
00:37:24,096 --> 00:37:28,448
Hillary Clinton website suffered

759
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:29,984
Repeated denial-of-service attack

760
00:37:30,496 --> 00:37:31,008
But then

761
00:37:31,264 --> 00:37:31,776
Couldn't

762
00:37:32,032 --> 00:37:37,920
Stop him videos continue to gather hundreds of thousands of views infowars.com

763
00:37:38,176 --> 00:37:39,968
Was practically the only resource

764
00:37:40,224 --> 00:37:42,784
Where do you lessons were covered thoroughly and objectively

765
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:48,672
Criticism toward the FBI and they discuss the weekly

766
00:37:48,928 --> 00:37:50,208
Infowars

767
00:37:50,464 --> 00:37:51,232
Has built itself

768
00:37:51,488 --> 00:37:52,512
Distill with the intro

769
00:37:52,768 --> 00:37:53,792
Of the American people

770
00:37:54,048 --> 00:37:58,656
This media organizations showed its independence from the world financial Elites

771
00:37:58,912 --> 00:38:02,496
It showed its sovereignty, So Below

772
00:38:02,752 --> 00:38:06,080
Promedia have utterly Bendis

773
00:38:06,336 --> 00:38:11,456
Credit revealing themselves along with credits

774
00:38:11,968 --> 00:38:15,808
Are becoming powerful forces in the new era a new paradigm

775
00:38:16,064 --> 00:38:17,856
Which Usher

776
00:38:19,904 --> 00:38:20,928
So that is a long

777
00:38:21,184 --> 00:38:22,208
Cooking intro

778
00:38:22,464 --> 00:38:22,976
But it's

779
00:38:23,232 --> 00:38:24,256
It's essential

780
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:26,304
Buttering up Ally

781
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:29,376
He's already on this is like the payoff

782
00:38:29,888 --> 00:38:33,216
You did a good job song

783
00:38:33,472 --> 00:38:38,848
Basically just like

784
00:38:39,616 --> 00:38:40,128
Do you know

785
00:38:40,896 --> 00:38:43,968
You believe this to be true

786
00:38:44,736 --> 00:38:45,504
Yep

787
00:38:48,064 --> 00:38:50,368
Stick with us we get it get it

788
00:38:50,624 --> 00:38:56,768
Everybody's happy now I really do truly believe that

789
00:38:58,304 --> 00:38:58,816
Got a phone

790
00:38:59,072 --> 00:39:00,096
Time to say it something is lost

791
00:39:00,352 --> 00:39:03,168
Translation cuz the Russian but I do think

792
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:04,192
But something is lost

793
00:39:04,448 --> 00:39:05,472
On Alex

794
00:39:05,984 --> 00:39:06,496
In terms of

795
00:39:07,008 --> 00:39:08,800
When Alexander Dugan

796
00:39:09,056 --> 00:39:09,824
And the Russians

797
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,104
Liberalism

798
00:39:11,872 --> 00:39:13,408
And when he liberal

799
00:39:16,224 --> 00:39:17,504
Because Alex Jones

800
00:39:18,016 --> 00:39:19,040
Libertarian beliefs

801
00:39:20,064 --> 00:39:21,856
Still rely on liberalism

802
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:25,440
They still rely on

803
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:27,232
Our systems of freedom

804
00:39:27,488 --> 00:39:28,768
Or Western ideals

805
00:39:29,792 --> 00:39:30,560
You disagree

806
00:39:30,816 --> 00:39:32,864
I don't think Alex has any idea what

807
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:33,632
What

808
00:39:33,888 --> 00:39:35,424
Ideas are about

809
00:39:37,472 --> 00:39:42,336
You can expose them only once but now he's a fascist

810
00:39:42,592 --> 00:39:43,616
Propaganda Outlet

811
00:39:45,408 --> 00:39:51,040
America America know he's clear lights clear whatever goes on rtu the American Patriot

812
00:39:55,648 --> 00:39:58,976
Comerica

813
00:39:59,232 --> 00:39:59,744
The Constitution

814
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:00,768
Cuz it disagrees

815
00:40:02,048 --> 00:40:04,608
Allowed to have gun

816
00:40:05,888 --> 00:40:08,448
Like systems

817
00:40:08,704 --> 00:40:10,752
He doesn't think that there should be checks on time

818
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:15,360
When liberals are in banana

819
00:40:15,616 --> 00:40:18,432
But generally speaking

820
00:40:19,456 --> 00:40:20,224
Service

821
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:21,248
That he wants to

822
00:40:21,504 --> 00:40:22,272
Make

823
00:40:22,784 --> 00:40:26,112
Law for everyone regardless of reality or fact

824
00:40:26,624 --> 00:40:27,136
He's on board

825
00:40:27,392 --> 00:40:32,256
Yeah I don't think he likes America most of these people actually like America

826
00:40:32,512 --> 00:40:33,024
I don't I don't

827
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:34,816
I don't think they do either but

828
00:40:35,072 --> 00:40:36,096
I'd still think

829
00:40:36,352 --> 00:40:37,376
That in his head

830
00:40:37,888 --> 00:40:40,448
The future he conceives of for America

831
00:40:40,704 --> 00:40:42,240
Does still rely

832
00:40:42,496 --> 00:40:43,008
On

833
00:40:43,264 --> 00:40:43,776
Liberal is

834
00:40:46,592 --> 00:40:52,736
What's the future in his head before we go any further what's the Futures that disconnect between what is rhetoric

835
00:40:56,576 --> 00:40:59,904
Because I don't think like we can very clearly see

836
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:06,816
Reach the logical extension of most of the things that he espouses

837
00:41:07,328 --> 00:41:08,096
You would end up

838
00:41:08,352 --> 00:41:13,728
Pretty quickly descending into a white ethnostate where everyone's armed and everyone's afraid of each other

839
00:41:13,984 --> 00:41:16,288
And everyone is disenfranchised

840
00:41:16,544 --> 00:41:17,312
No social

841
00:41:18,848 --> 00:41:23,968
Safety nets there is there is no

842
00:41:24,224 --> 00:41:29,088
Serfdom is unregulated children are back in the

843
00:41:29,344 --> 00:41:29,856
The cave

844
00:41:30,112 --> 00:41:35,488
Smog is only taken

845
00:41:35,744 --> 00:41:37,536
External View and look at it like that

846
00:41:37,792 --> 00:41:38,816
But I don't think

847
00:41:39,072 --> 00:41:41,120
He thinks that's the end result

848
00:41:42,912 --> 00:41:44,960
The delusion that he dwells in

849
00:41:45,728 --> 00:41:47,008
I think that he believes

850
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:48,032
That

851
00:41:49,568 --> 00:41:52,128
You're still going to end up with an equitable system

852
00:41:52,384 --> 00:41:53,151
Where

853
00:41:53,407 --> 00:41:55,967
People have freedom they have Liberty they have

854
00:41:56,479 --> 00:41:57,503
Can still vote

855
00:41:57,759 --> 00:41:58,783
All that stuff

856
00:41:59,039 --> 00:42:01,855
You're just going to have businesses that are Unshackled

857
00:42:02,367 --> 00:42:03,647
Like he doesn't understand

858
00:42:04,159 --> 00:42:05,183
What historic Lee his

859
00:42:06,207 --> 00:42:07,231
The end result of that sort

860
00:42:10,303 --> 00:42:11,327
Coal mining accident

861
00:42:14,143 --> 00:42:18,495
Even back then in the nightmare that we lived in in

862
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:21,055
20 right

863
00:42:21,567 --> 00:42:24,383
We still have a religion

864
00:42:24,639 --> 00:42:28,991
Women because they didn't bother having any safety equipment

865
00:42:29,247 --> 00:42:32,319
Textile mills that we still lived in a liberalist system

866
00:42:32,575 --> 00:42:33,599
We still lived

867
00:42:33,855 --> 00:42:34,879
In a western democracy

868
00:42:35,391 --> 00:42:35,903
Right

869
00:42:36,159 --> 00:42:36,927
Is what

870
00:42:37,183 --> 00:42:39,231
Alexander Dugan and his ilk

871
00:42:39,487 --> 00:42:40,255
Are opposed

872
00:42:41,023 --> 00:42:41,791
They are opposed

873
00:42:42,047 --> 00:42:43,071
To Western democracy

874
00:42:44,351 --> 00:42:46,655
Alex doesn't realize when he's talk

875
00:42:46,911 --> 00:42:47,679
When he's talking

876
00:42:47,935 --> 00:42:48,703
Alexander Dugan

877
00:42:48,959 --> 00:42:53,567
Liberalism is a cancer

878
00:42:53,823 --> 00:42:55,359
Even these vests

879
00:42:55,615 --> 00:42:57,407
Digital images of America that Alex

880
00:42:58,687 --> 00:42:59,455
He doesn't realize I

881
00:42:59,711 --> 00:43:02,015
But he hears liberal in there

882
00:43:02,271 --> 00:43:04,063
Right and that's enough for him

883
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:07,903
Right

884
00:43:08,159 --> 00:43:09,439
That's the point I'm trying to get you

885
00:43:09,695 --> 00:43:12,511
You clinically I can never I can absolutely

886
00:43:13,791 --> 00:43:15,071
And there's another disconnect

887
00:43:19,423 --> 00:43:19,935
It is

888
00:43:20,703 --> 00:43:21,471
Alex Jones is f***

889
00:43:22,495 --> 00:43:25,567
Eddie doesn't realize what he's up to he's in way over his head

890
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:28,639
Isn't so far over his head

891
00:43:28,895 --> 00:43:31,455
But the other thing that gets lost

892
00:43:31,967 --> 00:43:32,991
Translation is the idea of

893
00:43:33,247 --> 00:43:33,759
Anti-American

894
00:43:34,527 --> 00:43:35,807
That's going to come up

895
00:43:36,063 --> 00:43:37,343
I believe in this neck

896
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:38,111
Text Cliff

897
00:43:39,391 --> 00:43:41,183
Explain on the other end of it would I

898
00:43:44,511 --> 00:43:47,839
I'm very happy that Alex Jones is live with us

899
00:43:48,095 --> 00:43:48,607
Right now

900
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:50,911
We have been following you Alex

901
00:43:51,167 --> 00:43:51,935
For many years

902
00:43:52,447 --> 00:43:53,983
Including myself personally

903
00:43:54,239 --> 00:43:56,287
And when you became

904
00:43:56,543 --> 00:43:58,335
In this new era of Donald Trump

905
00:43:58,847 --> 00:43:59,871
I marveled at

906
00:44:00,127 --> 00:44:01,407
That you the fact that

907
00:44:01,919 --> 00:44:02,943
People as yourself

908
00:44:03,455 --> 00:44:04,479

Which are shared in reality by millions

The people

American

914
00:44:12,415 --> 00:44:13,183
And worldwide

915
00:44:13,439 --> 00:44:14,719
The millions of Russian peep

916
00:44:15,487 --> 00:44:16,767
Did you have a giant

917
00:44:17,023 --> 00:44:18,303
Hero of this campaign

918

How you told the truth

919
00:44:20,607 --> 00:44:22,399
Everyone else lies

920
00:44:22,911 --> 00:44:24,447
How you held your ground

921
00:44:24,703 --> 00:44:25,215
Fearlessly

922
00:44:25,727 --> 00:44:27,007
Against

923
00:44:27,519 --> 00:44:30,335
All the dirt that they were throwing your way

924
00:44:36,991 --> 00:44:39,039
Example of a true American man

925
00:44:39,551 --> 00:44:41,343
The true American Spirit

926
00:44:42,623 --> 00:44:45,951
Alex Ramirez elected Hillary

927
00:44:46,975 --> 00:44:48,255
A real American

928
00:44:48,511 --> 00:44:49,023
Is

929
00:44:50,303 --> 00:44:52,863
With the American people are anything like you

930
00:44:53,631 --> 00:44:55,935
Attitude toward your country

931
00:44:56,447 --> 00:44:57,727
Toward your people

932
00:44:58,239 --> 00:44:59,519
Will be radically

933
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:03,871
Donald Trump won

934
00:45:04,127 --> 00:45:05,151
School music Portage

935
00:45:05,663 --> 00:45:08,479
And whom we were also in solidarity with

936
00:45:08,991 --> 00:45:12,063
Not a good thing to say in hindsight and him

937
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:13,343
And all of us

938
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:14,111
1

939
00:45:14,367 --> 00:45:16,671
I said this

940
00:45:20,255 --> 00:45:22,047
Anti-americanism is

941
00:45:22,303 --> 00:45:22,815
Over

942
00:45:23,071 --> 00:45:25,631

950
00:45:42,527 --> 00:45:43,295
We thank you

951
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:46,879
The genuine face of real America

952
00:45:48,159 --> 00:45:48,927
Call Alex

953
00:45:49,183 --> 00:45:55,327
Alex alright was great having you on our show some more nice things about you go home

954
00:46:05,311 --> 00:46:08,383
And if you noticed whenever he's on the Russian television he doesn't act like he

955
00:46:08,639 --> 00:46:12,223
Acted on that BBC interview

956
00:46:12,991 --> 00:46:13,503
Sensible

957
00:46:14,015 --> 00:46:14,527
PX

958
00:46:14,783 --> 00:46:16,319
Like someone actually who respect

959
00:46:16,831 --> 00:46:19,391
The person he's talking to

960
00:46:19,647 --> 00:46:20,927
It's very strange can't think of any reason

961
00:46:21,183 --> 00:46:21,695
No

962
00:46:22,975 --> 00:46:25,535
Americanism is over

963
00:46:28,607 --> 00:46:29,375
I think

964
00:46:29,887 --> 00:46:30,655
Then how Alex

965
00:46:30,911 --> 00:46:31,423
Here's that

966
00:46:31,935 --> 00:46:32,959
I know this because he's talked

967
00:46:34,495 --> 00:46:35,775
He hears that and he's like

968
00:46:36,031 --> 00:46:37,055
I have solved

969
00:46:37,567 --> 00:46:39,103
The Russia America problem

970
00:46:39,871 --> 00:46:41,151
They don't hate us anymore

971
00:46:41,663 --> 00:46:43,455
What he doesn't realize is

972
00:46:43,711 --> 00:46:47,039
The subtext of what Alexander Dugan is saying there is

973
00:46:47,551 --> 00:46:48,063
We won

974
00:46:48,831 --> 00:46:50,623
Americanism is over because

975
00:46:51,135 --> 00:46:51,903
We won

976
00:46:52,159 --> 00:46:54,719
We don't need to psi

977
00:46:55,231 --> 00:46:58,047
You guys are pro-russia you guys are

978
00:46:58,559 --> 00:46:59,327
Serving our interest

979
00:46:59,583 --> 00:47:00,863
Yeah we have flipped

980
00:47:01,375 --> 00:47:02,143
Entirely

981
00:47:02,399 --> 00:47:05,471
To a point where our problem is with the unk

982
00:47:05,727 --> 00:47:07,263
Keeps telling us we can't do this s***

983
00:47:07,519 --> 00:47:08,543
That we want to do

984
00:47:08,799 --> 00:47:10,079
We can't take

985
00:47:10,335 --> 00:47:13,407
The Soviet Union

986
00:47:13,663 --> 00:47:16,479
What he foresees is the is Eurasian ism

987
00:47:16,735 --> 00:47:19,039
And Eurasian Union

988
00:47:19,295 --> 00:47:20,575
Soviet Union

989
00:47:21,855 --> 00:47:22,623
Been his

990
00:47:23,135 --> 00:47:24,159
Fantasypros

991
00:47:24,415 --> 00:47:28,511
Underpinning of his philosophy that you're raising Union

992
00:47:28,767 --> 00:47:32,351
Start to have a lot more sober

993
00:47:32,863 --> 00:47:36,447
Do it but it still be your raise or even if it doesn't need to have that

994
00:47:36,959 --> 00:47:42,079
Can still do the same game that Nazis Alex does Nazi ideology

995
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:46,943
You can do all the things you want to do with just changing one word

996
00:47:47,967 --> 00:47:49,247
That's simple

997
00:47:49,503 --> 00:47:50,527
Eurasian Union

998
00:47:51,039 --> 00:47:57,183
Is Enron still around

999
00:47:58,975 --> 00:47:59,999
Hey man there's a

1000
00:48:00,255 --> 00:48:02,047
Guillotine folk right there

1001
00:48:02,303 --> 00:48:07,423
Folk with the guillotine on their names now you're wrong Alex Jones thinks that's enough for me

1002
00:48:08,703 --> 00:48:12,031
So you're getting a full dose

1003
00:48:13,055 --> 00:48:13,823
I just

1004
00:48:16,383 --> 00:48:22,527
This is the sort of stuff that you imagine Alex's keyring behind the theme probably the entire time

1005
00:48:22,783 --> 00:48:23,807
Restorative like

1006
00:48:24,063 --> 00:48:26,111
Through intermediaries they like you

1007
00:48:26,367 --> 00:48:28,159
The only voice that's really telling the truth

1008
00:48:28,415 --> 00:48:29,695
The rest of the world knows it

1009
00:48:30,207 --> 00:48:30,975
Elvis store

1010
00:48:31,743 --> 00:48:33,279
This is a thousand times

1011
00:48:33,791 --> 00:48:35,327
More effective than just

1012
00:48:35,583 --> 00:48:36,607
Louis Farrakhan having a

1013
00:48:36,863 --> 00:48:37,631
Couple of people with

1014
00:48:46,847 --> 00:48:47,871
You could have just said

1015
00:48:48,127 --> 00:48:52,223
He was really good and he would have been exactly as in

1016
00:48:52,479 --> 00:48:54,271
As You Are

1017
00:48:54,527 --> 00:48:56,831
25 minutes

1018
00:48:57,087 --> 00:48:58,623
Where is the culmination of

1019
00:48:58,879 --> 00:48:59,647
Love so much

1020
00:48:59,903 --> 00:49:02,207
Galaxy probably feel slighted if they didn't

1021
00:49:02,463 --> 00:49:03,487
Because

1022
00:49:03,999 --> 00:49:05,535
When you are someone

1023
00:49:05,791 --> 00:49:06,303
Like

1024
00:49:07,327 --> 00:49:08,863
It's easy to imagine

1025
00:49:09,631 --> 00:49:11,423
Your influence is greater than it is

1026
00:49:11,679 --> 00:49:14,239
Sometimes you need those things

1027
00:49:16,031 --> 00:49:16,799
Make

1028
00:49:17,311 --> 00:49:18,847
Your internal perception

1029
00:49:19,103 --> 00:49:20,127
Appear to match

1030
00:49:20,383 --> 00:49:21,151
The external reality

1031
00:49:21,407 --> 00:49:23,711
Like having Donald Trump on the show

1032
00:49:24,223 --> 00:49:26,527
You should probably didn't Merit that

1033
00:49:26,783 --> 00:49:29,087
But because his involvement with Rodger Stone

1034
00:49:29,343 --> 00:49:30,879
And working it out behind the scene

1035
00:49:31,135 --> 00:49:32,671
Donald Trump

1036
00:49:32,927 --> 00:49:34,207
I won't let you down

1037
00:49:34,463 --> 00:49:40,607
You're going to be really very happy we're going to talk a lot in the future what have you

1038
00:49:40,863 --> 00:49:42,399
Jones Ascent of himself

1039
00:49:42,655 --> 00:49:43,679
After the election

1040
00:49:44,703 --> 00:49:46,239
Alex we heard him on

1041
00:49:46,495 --> 00:49:48,287
Election night drunk at 3 in the morning

1042
00:49:48,543 --> 00:49:50,079
Sing I have served my purpose

1043
00:49:50,335 --> 00:49:52,127
Then he goes on Russian television

1044
00:49:52,383 --> 00:49:53,407
A couple days later

1045
00:49:53,663 --> 00:49:55,455
And they basically mirror that back to him

1046
00:49:55,711 --> 00:49:58,527
You can imagine that that's how the rest of the world field

1047
00:49:59,039 --> 00:50:00,575
I have saved the world

1048
00:50:00,831 --> 00:50:01,599
From global

1049
00:50:01,855 --> 00:50:02,879
I have done

1050
00:50:03,135 --> 00:50:05,951
Such an amazing and that's why he looks like he's going to cry the whole time

1051
00:50:06,207 --> 00:50:09,791
Which I'm all yours during back

1052
00:50:10,047 --> 00:50:10,815
Cuz he's realizing

1053
00:50:11,071 --> 00:50:12,863
Oh no they said nice things about me

1054
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:19,263
And now they want me to go back in the corner

1055
00:50:19,519 --> 00:50:25,151
You said I was Alex's done a little like

1056
00:50:25,407 --> 00:50:25,919
I don't think he has

1057
00:50:26,175 --> 00:50:32,063
Because I ate I'm doing research people that are flattering him actually

1058
00:50:32,319 --> 00:50:32,831
It would be

1059
00:50:33,087 --> 00:50:39,231
Incredibly troubling or is he ever looked at the chat room

1060
00:50:39,487 --> 00:50:45,631
All of the all of the Alex talk about

1061
00:50:45,887 --> 00:50:46,911
Why the Jews are evil

1062
00:50:47,167 --> 00:50:48,959
All of the n-word flying around

1063
00:50:51,263 --> 00:50:52,799
I knows it like we

1064
00:50:53,311 --> 00:50:53,823
Maybe they are

1065
00:50:54,591 --> 00:50:55,359
I don't know if it's

1066
00:50:55,615 --> 00:50:59,711
Gringo's on some level even for us to be like

1067
00:50:59,967 --> 00:51:00,479
Everyone is

1068
00:51:00,735 --> 00:51:01,247
Cool

1069
00:51:04,575 --> 00:51:05,599
If our audience

1070
00:51:05,855 --> 00:51:06,623
We're like

1071
00:51:06,879 --> 00:51:13,023
If we went to the chat room one night and we saw an Edward I think we might cancel the show

1072
00:51:16,351 --> 00:51:19,167
Celebrated Alex Jones doesn't read the chat room than what have you

1073
00:51:19,423 --> 00:51:24,543
Part of him that he is either in complete denial about that large

1074
00:51:24,799 --> 00:51:25,823
Chunk of his audience

1075
00:51:26,335 --> 00:51:26,847
Or just

1076
00:51:27,103 --> 00:51:28,127
Do you have to shy away from

1077
00:51:28,383 --> 00:51:30,687
Entirely and only listen to voices

1078
00:51:30,943 --> 00:51:31,455
That are like

1079
00:51:31,711 --> 00:51:34,527
You are the true version of America

1080
00:51:34,783 --> 00:51:36,575
You have saved the international

1081
00:51:36,831 --> 00:51:37,343
Singing

1082
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:39,135
And now we will rebuild

1083
00:51:39,391 --> 00:51:42,975
International order probably the most

1084
00:51:43,231 --> 00:51:44,767
Reasonable

1085
00:51:45,023 --> 00:51:46,303
Relatable in humans

1086
00:51:47,071 --> 00:51:47,839
Though is that

1087
00:51:48,351 --> 00:51:51,167
Of course you make compromises if you want to make a s*** ton of money

1088
00:51:52,191 --> 00:51:52,703
Part of the game

1089
00:51:54,495 --> 00:51:57,567
Specific to Alex it's unfortunate

1090
00:51:58,335 --> 00:51:59,615
It's

1091
00:51:59,871 --> 00:52:04,735
Piece of s*** he's willing to become the consequences Fortinet

1092
00:52:04,991 --> 00:52:05,759
Cuz he's willing to make

1093
00:52:07,807 --> 00:52:08,319
Uncompromising

1094
00:52:08,575 --> 00:52:10,623
This to your ethical or moral

1095
00:52:11,135 --> 00:52:12,415
Ideology in order

1096
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:13,439
To become a

1097
00:52:13,695 --> 00:52:17,279
Very wealthy man seems a very common theme with everybody

1098
00:52:17,535 --> 00:52:20,351
Becomes wealthy I think that's the trajectory of his entire

1099
00:52:20,607 --> 00:52:22,399
Career the compromises that

1100
00:52:22,655 --> 00:52:25,983
He clearly made when he infiltrated Bohemian Grove

1101
00:52:26,239 --> 00:52:27,519
Happy quotes

1102
00:52:28,543 --> 00:52:32,127
The the willingness to lie and misrepresent what he saw there

1103
00:52:32,639 --> 00:52:33,663
In order to

1104
00:52:33,919 --> 00:52:34,687
In his mind

1105
00:52:34,943 --> 00:52:36,735
Take down the banking Elite

1106
00:52:38,015 --> 00:52:39,551
That probably

1107
00:52:39,807 --> 00:52:41,855
I want to

1108
00:52:42,111 --> 00:52:43,135
Noble goal

1109
00:52:43,647 --> 00:52:46,975
You know what I mean like

1110
00:52:47,231 --> 00:52:50,047
Is there is an element of it

1111
00:52:50,303 --> 00:52:52,095
You know the end goal is

1112
00:52:52,863 --> 00:52:59,007
You know reordering that to some extent and making sure that people are punished for financial crimes in the same

1113
00:52:59,263 --> 00:53:01,823
Someone with a joint is punished

1114
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:02,847
I can't imagine

1115
00:53:03,103 --> 00:53:05,919
But once you go down the

1116
00:53:06,175 --> 00:53:08,223
The path of completely lying about them

1117
00:53:08,479 --> 00:53:09,759
And saying they're all sickness

1118
00:53:10,271 --> 00:53:12,063
Amping up that rhetoric

1119
00:53:12,319 --> 00:53:12,831
And

1120
00:53:13,087 --> 00:53:16,415
Adopting so much of this washed over anti-semitism

1121
00:53:17,439 --> 00:53:19,487
What you do is you ruined for good

1122
00:53:19,743 --> 00:53:20,767
A suit that you have

1123
00:53:21,023 --> 00:53:22,303
And all of the

1124
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:23,583
Become so much more important

1125
00:53:23,839 --> 00:53:24,607
To your audience

1126
00:53:24,863 --> 00:53:27,167
I think that's the story of his career

1127
00:53:29,215 --> 00:53:30,495
Brilliant move

1128
00:53:30,751 --> 00:53:32,799
Classic move on the part of the people who wrecked

1129
00:53:33,311 --> 00:53:33,823
The economy

1130
00:53:34,847 --> 00:53:36,895
We're all pretty much

1131
00:53:37,407 --> 00:53:38,687
That be, Spock

1132
00:53:39,199 --> 00:53:40,735
And it's unsustainable in

1133
00:53:41,247 --> 00:53:43,295
Market continues to rise

1134
00:53:43,551 --> 00:53:46,623
The only thing that every reasonable person should be thinking is

1135
00:53:47,391 --> 00:53:48,159
Boy how bad is

1136
00:53:48,415 --> 00:53:48,927
The crash going to

1137
00:53:49,183 --> 00:53:50,975
Especially as the growth rate

1138
00:53:52,511 --> 00:53:53,535
What has nothing

1139
00:53:53,791 --> 00:53:55,071
To do with real wage increase

1140
00:53:57,887 --> 00:53:58,655
Every time

1141
00:53:58,911 --> 00:53:59,679
Ever happen

1142
00:53:59,935 --> 00:54:01,727
There's been a spectacular crack

1143
00:54:01,983 --> 00:54:03,519
The Dust Bowl was a thing

1144
00:54:03,775 --> 00:54:08,639
You know overvold were a thick degree iron

1145
00:54:08,895 --> 00:54:10,943
This is this is Maybe

1146
00:54:11,455 --> 00:54:13,247
Because what ended up saving

1147
00:54:13,503 --> 00:54:14,015
The world

1148
00:54:14,271 --> 00:54:16,319
Maybe the world at least America

1149
00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:19,135
The depression that we had was the New Deal

1150
00:54:19,391 --> 00:54:21,439
ER and it was Democratic

1151
00:54:22,207 --> 00:54:26,047
It may be

1152
00:54:26,303 --> 00:54:29,631
Socialist

1153
00:54:30,143 --> 00:54:32,703
Can't figure out the USPS

1154
00:54:33,215 --> 00:54:38,591
Great ideas but I'm telling you the actual nuts and bolts of it difficult

1155
00:54:38,847 --> 00:54:40,895
Alex Jones wants to go back to the Pony Express

1156
00:54:42,431 --> 00:54:43,199
Work better

1157
00:54:44,735 --> 00:54:46,527
It might be the most important thing

1158
00:54:46,783 --> 00:54:47,295
Now

1159
00:54:47,551 --> 00:54:48,575
To build

1160
00:54:48,831 --> 00:54:49,599
Voice

1161
00:54:50,111 --> 00:54:50,879
In America

1162
00:54:51,135 --> 00:54:52,415
Before the coming

1163
00:54:52,671 --> 00:54:53,183
Disaster

1164
00:54:53,695 --> 00:54:55,999
Because those are the ideas

1165
00:54:56,511 --> 00:54:57,279
Save us from

1166
00:54:57,535 --> 00:54:58,815
The inevitable crash

1167
00:54:59,327 --> 00:55:00,095
I don't know

1168
00:55:00,351 --> 00:55:02,655
I don't know that's just a thought that be kicking around in my head

1169
00:55:04,959 --> 00:55:11,103
Prescriptive

1170
00:55:11,359 --> 00:55:11,871
Prevent

1171
00:55:12,383 --> 00:55:13,919
Better now

1172
00:55:14,175 --> 00:55:15,199
Build up

1173
00:55:16,991 --> 00:55:21,599
To start when the crash happened

1174
00:55:21,855 --> 00:55:23,135
This is the way to go

1175
00:55:23,391 --> 00:55:25,439
This absolutely is what we need

1176
00:55:25,695 --> 00:55:26,975
To do an align ourselves with

1177
00:55:27,743 --> 00:55:29,279
Instead of a national party that's like

1178
00:55:29,535 --> 00:55:30,303
You guys are right

1179
00:55:31,327 --> 00:55:31,839
What if

1180
00:55:32,095 --> 00:55:33,375
We don't do what you say

1181
00:55:33,887 --> 00:55:35,423
Aaron said keep getting a s*** ton of money

1182
00:55:35,679 --> 00:55:38,495
You know what my theory is like I work this out a little bit

1183
00:55:39,519 --> 00:55:40,287
I believe that

1184
00:55:40,543 --> 00:55:41,823
Democrat to Republican

1185
00:55:43,103 --> 00:55:45,663
Because they are sort of Warring versions of

1186
00:55:45,919 --> 00:55:46,431
The same sort of

1187
00:55:46,687 --> 00:55:48,991
Massive corporate interest

1188
00:55:49,247 --> 00:55:50,015
Slightly

1189
00:55:55,647 --> 00:55:56,159
Banana

1190
00:55:56,415 --> 00:55:57,951
But

1191
00:55:58,463 --> 00:55:59,487
Literally

1192
00:56:01,535 --> 00:56:02,303
2 years ago

1193
00:56:02,815 --> 00:56:03,583
They were

1194
00:56:03,839 --> 00:56:04,863
Sides of the same coin

1195
00:56:05,887 --> 00:56:09,215
The GOP itself is still a largely corporate beholding

1196
00:56:09,471 --> 00:56:10,751
Special interest party

1197
00:56:11,263 --> 00:56:12,031
And so are the

1198
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:15,871
GOP is already crumbling

1199
00:56:16,127 --> 00:56:19,967
To the libertarian Patriot Wing or whatever of it

1200
00:56:22,783 --> 00:56:24,063
Like the defensive Roy Moore

1201
00:56:24,319 --> 00:56:24,831
That's weird

1202
00:56:25,343 --> 00:56:26,367
Is bananas

1203
00:56:26,879 --> 00:56:29,951
And the fact that they're fine with it but yes it is

1204
00:56:30,207 --> 00:56:30,975
Because

1205
00:56:31,231 --> 00:56:31,999
The part B

1206
00:56:32,255 --> 00:56:32,767
Supports him

1207
00:56:33,023 --> 00:56:34,303
Are the libertarian

1208
00:56:34,559 --> 00:56:35,071
And Patriot

1209
00:56:35,327 --> 00:56:35,839
Wingding

1210
00:56:36,095 --> 00:56:38,399
He has the support

1211
00:56:39,167 --> 00:56:40,191
If you was a Mainline

1212
00:56:40,447 --> 00:56:46,591
Conservative GOP member like Paul Ryan

1213
00:56:47,103 --> 00:56:49,151
Tumi

1214
00:56:49,407 --> 00:56:49,919
Espouse

1215
00:56:50,431 --> 00:56:52,223
What we will see in the coming

1216
00:56:52,735 --> 00:56:54,015
I think in the next few years

1217
00:56:54,271 --> 00:56:57,343
You're going to corporate Republican established

1218
00:56:57,855 --> 00:56:58,879
Completely destroyed in

1219
00:56:59,135 --> 00:56:59,647
Replaced with this

1220
00:57:00,159 --> 00:57:02,719
Hyper nativist Pro libertarian

1221
00:57:02,975 --> 00:57:03,487
Party

1222
00:57:03,999 --> 00:57:05,279
And if the know-nothing

1223
00:57:07,071 --> 00:57:08,863
Powerhouse

1224
00:57:09,119 --> 00:57:10,655
The dangerous part about that

1225
00:57:10,911 --> 00:57:12,703
Is that libertarian party

1226
00:57:12,959 --> 00:57:15,007
The Proto libertarian

1227
00:57:15,519 --> 00:57:16,799
The protos not the right word

1228
00:57:17,311 --> 00:57:19,103
Right

1229
00:57:19,359 --> 00:57:19,871
Democrat

1230
00:57:20,127 --> 00:57:22,687
I can fight much harder it weighed

1231
00:57:22,943 --> 00:57:24,735
Republican establishment

1232
00:57:24,991 --> 00:57:28,831
To maintain the Democrats as their foil

1233
00:57:29,087 --> 00:57:29,599
Wouldn't

1234
00:57:30,879 --> 00:57:33,183
Scary because those Democrat those corporate Democrat

1235
00:57:33,439 --> 00:57:35,487
Are going to fight back I don't understand

1236
00:57:35,999 --> 00:57:37,023
They don't

1237
00:57:38,047 --> 00:57:41,375
Yeah cuz they're only they're only there only ideology

1238
00:57:41,631 --> 00:57:44,191
She is ultimately compromised think that it's

1239
00:57:45,471 --> 00:57:46,495
So long as

1240
00:57:47,007 --> 00:57:47,519
But

1241
00:57:48,031 --> 00:57:48,543
Like that

1242
00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:50,079
When you're fighting against

1243
00:57:50,335 --> 00:57:52,383
People like Alex Jones

1244
00:57:54,175 --> 00:57:56,479
Everybody who doesn't agree with us

1245
00:57:56,991 --> 00:57:57,759
Fox kids

1246
00:57:58,271 --> 00:58:01,343
Yeah you're not going to like you're not okay

1247
00:58:01,599 --> 00:58:03,647
Well we will give you

1248
00:58:03,903 --> 00:58:05,439
A harder border

1249
00:58:05,951 --> 00:58:12,095
Chuck chuck shoulder Lost Empire

1250
00:58:12,351 --> 00:58:13,887
Compromise

1251
00:58:14,143 --> 00:58:15,167
Stupid

1252
00:58:15,423 --> 00:58:16,703
And there is no like

1253
00:58:16,959 --> 00:58:18,751
It's not like there's no compromise

1254
00:58:19,007 --> 00:58:22,335
It's in the minds of the Alex Jones

1255
00:58:22,591 --> 00:58:23,359
Libertarian

1256
00:58:23,615 --> 00:58:24,383
Patriot right

1257
00:58:24,895 --> 00:58:25,407
There's no interest

1258
00:58:25,663 --> 00:58:26,431
10 compromise

1259
00:58:26,687 --> 00:58:29,247
There's only interest in like what you always

1260
00:58:30,783 --> 00:58:32,063
Growling

1261
00:58:32,319 --> 00:58:36,159
Nothing to do with

1262
00:58:36,415 --> 00:58:39,487
If you're ostensibly

1263
00:58:40,255 --> 00:58:42,815
Constitutional geopier

1264
00:58:43,839 --> 00:58:44,351
Can't

1265
00:58:44,607 --> 00:58:46,911
Vote for somebody who's violated the

1266
00:58:47,167 --> 00:58:47,935
Katusha

1267
00:58:48,191 --> 00:58:49,983
That's something that you can't just

1268
00:58:50,495 --> 00:58:53,567
You're voting for

1269
00:58:53,823 --> 00:58:56,127
Position

1270
00:58:57,407 --> 00:58:59,455
Violating

1271
00:58:59,711 --> 00:59:01,503
Intuition that you f****** love so much

1272
00:59:01,759 --> 00:59:02,527
And then you're like

1273
00:59:02,783 --> 00:59:03,295
Okay

1274
00:59:04,063 --> 00:59:06,879
Yes you did. He's done that we're still going about

1275
00:59:07,391 --> 00:59:08,927
And then you're like well we hate

1276
00:59:09,183 --> 00:59:11,487
What is a pet

1277
00:59:11,743 --> 00:59:13,791
What's going you can't be like oh

1278
00:59:14,047 --> 00:59:14,559
Well

1279
00:59:14,815 --> 00:59:15,839
We're still going to vote for

1280
00:59:16,095 --> 00:59:18,911
He loves guns and he's into the Trump agenda

1281
00:59:19,167 --> 00:59:22,239
Quotes

1282
00:59:25,823 --> 00:59:28,383
Call Maria

1283
00:59:28,895 --> 00:59:32,479
Guess the bottom line

1284
00:59:32,735 --> 00:59:34,015
The political correct

1285
00:59:34,527 --> 00:59:35,551
Age of consent law

1286
00:59:35,807 --> 00:59:36,319
Bad

1287
00:59:36,575 --> 00:59:37,855
The point that I'm

1288
00:59:38,111 --> 00:59:39,391
I'm trying to get to Ibis

1289
00:59:39,647 --> 00:59:41,183
Is that the last

1290
00:59:41,439 --> 00:59:41,951
Needs

1291
00:59:42,463 --> 00:59:43,999
To get on board

1292
00:59:44,255 --> 00:59:44,767
With that

1293
00:59:45,023 --> 00:59:45,535
Knowledge

1294
00:59:46,303 --> 00:59:46,815
Immediately

1295
00:59:47,071 --> 00:59:47,839
And they don't

1296
00:59:48,095 --> 00:59:49,119
Will come

1297
00:59:49,631 --> 00:59:51,423
I think it'll come within the next few years

1298
00:59:51,935 --> 00:59:52,959
The dance

1299
00:59:53,215 --> 00:59:54,239
Of back-and-forth

1300
00:59:55,007 --> 00:59:57,311
Aspiring to reach across the aisle kind of stuff

1301
00:59:57,823 --> 01:00:02,175
Is not it's not going to have any stock in trade

1302
01:00:02,431 --> 01:00:06,015
There's a denial. Ann Obama wasn't

1303
01:00:06,271 --> 01:00:07,295
The best even with

1304
01:00:07,551 --> 01:00:08,575
The aspirations of

1305
01:00:08,831 --> 01:00:12,415
Compromised

1306
01:00:13,695 --> 01:00:15,743
Mainly to his obsession with

1307
01:00:17,279 --> 01:00:18,047
With

1308
01:00:18,303 --> 01:00:21,631
With Republican financial interest

1309
01:00:21,887 --> 01:00:22,655
The point is

1310
01:00:23,167 --> 01:00:24,191
That game is over

1311
01:00:24,703 --> 01:00:26,239
And it's not over because

1312
01:00:26,751 --> 01:00:29,311
I'm saying you can't compromise with the Patriots

1313
01:00:29,567 --> 01:00:33,919
Or would anything like that I'm saying it's over because that will not be on the table

1314
01:00:34,175 --> 01:00:36,479
Do you know how happy I am to hear you say that

1315
01:00:36,991 --> 01:00:37,759
I don't know

1316
01:00:38,015 --> 01:00:43,903
Because you have

1317
01:00:44,415 --> 01:00:46,463
Disagree with me on that very point

1318
01:00:46,719 --> 01:00:47,231
4 month

1319
01:00:47,487 --> 01:00:49,279
Finally you have come

1320
01:00:49,535 --> 01:00:54,655
Well realization though there is no further compromised available

1321
01:00:54,911 --> 01:00:56,959
I still believe that there are

1322
01:00:57,215 --> 01:00:58,751
People who identify as conservative

1323
01:00:59,007 --> 01:01:00,799
Out there in the world citizen

1324
01:01:01,567 --> 01:01:02,847
Who are not

1325
01:01:03,103 --> 01:01:04,895
Is the problem that we're diagnosing

1326
01:01:05,151 --> 01:01:11,295
And I respect and I get ultimately has been kind of a miscommunication but

1327
01:01:12,319 --> 01:01:13,087
Matter of scale

1328
01:01:13,343 --> 01:01:15,135
But we're both in agreement

1329
01:01:18,463 --> 01:01:19,487
Not just unwilling to

1330
01:01:19,999 --> 01:01:21,535
Ideologically

1331
01:01:21,791 --> 01:01:22,303
Hosed

1332
01:01:22,559 --> 01:01:24,607
2 compromise

1333
01:01:24,863 --> 01:01:26,655
There's no possibility

1334
01:01:27,423 --> 01:01:33,567
I am I so much as there is a part of it now but what I talked about more

1335
01:01:33,823 --> 01:01:34,847
Wait what

1336
01:01:35,359 --> 01:01:41,503
What I'm talking about is there will be within

1337
01:01:41,759 --> 01:01:42,783
A matter of years

1338
01:01:44,063 --> 01:01:46,879
Probably exacerbated by election

1339
01:01:47,391 --> 01:01:49,439
Michael's Tucson

1340
01:01:51,231 --> 01:01:53,279
But I believe as we get closer

1341
01:01:54,303 --> 01:01:55,071
You're going to

1342
01:01:56,095 --> 01:01:57,631
A horse swing

1343
01:01:57,887 --> 01:01:59,423
End of that Direction with

1344
01:01:59,679 --> 01:02:00,959
The people who are on the right

1345
01:02:04,287 --> 01:02:06,079
And if people on the left don't

1346
01:02:06,335 --> 01:02:07,871
Prepare for that in some ways

1347
01:02:08,383 --> 01:02:08,895
They're going

1348
01:02:09,151 --> 01:02:09,919
To get to steamroll

1349
01:02:10,175 --> 01:02:13,247
Well here's going to be a complete disaster may be the simplest

1350
01:02:13,759 --> 01:02:16,319
Explanation of why the Democratic party itself

1351
01:02:16,831 --> 01:02:17,343
Something that you

1352
01:02:17,599 --> 01:02:18,111
Should not trust

1353
01:02:18,879 --> 01:02:19,647
Appreciate

1354
01:02:20,415 --> 01:02:21,183
And that is that

1355
01:02:21,695 --> 01:02:22,463
Imagine

1356
01:02:22,719 --> 01:02:23,231
In 2018

1357
01:02:23,999 --> 01:02:27,583
That we wind up that the Democrats wind up taking both the house

1358
01:02:27,839 --> 01:02:28,351
And the Senate

1359
01:02:28,607 --> 01:02:31,167
And actually getting a supermajority

1360
01:02:31,423 --> 01:02:34,751
Which is very possible at this point if you start to look at the Alexa

1361
01:02:35,007 --> 01:02:38,079
Results that we've seen entirely possible

1362
01:02:38,335 --> 01:02:39,871
That the anti Trump

1363
01:02:40,127 --> 01:02:41,407
Fervor

1364
01:02:41,663 --> 01:02:47,807
Will absolutely Propel the Democrats to majorities in both

1365
01:02:50,111 --> 01:02:51,903
Won't

1366
01:02:52,927 --> 01:02:54,719
Well and they haven't fought for

1367
01:02:54,975 --> 01:02:57,535
Voting rights

1368
01:02:57,791 --> 01:02:58,559
Even with

1369
01:02:58,815 --> 01:03:01,631
Results that were singing

1370
01:03:01,887 --> 01:03:03,423
The clear sentiment

1371
01:03:03,679 --> 01:03:06,495
The large portion of the population that

1372
01:03:07,007 --> 01:03:10,079
It's not going the way it's right if you have people were

1373
01:03:10,335 --> 01:03:12,639
Franchise did you have people who were kicked off voter rolls

1374
01:03:12,895 --> 01:03:14,943
You have these extreme gerrymandering

1375
01:03:15,199 --> 01:03:15,711
Situation

1376
01:03:15,967 --> 01:03:16,735
You're not going

1377
01:03:16,991 --> 01:03:18,015
To be able to

1378
01:03:18,271 --> 01:03:19,807
Have the people's voice

1379
01:03:20,063 --> 01:03:22,623
Accurately displayed in the vote

1380
01:03:24,159 --> 01:03:26,207
Complicit

1381
01:03:26,463 --> 01:03:29,023
It's very easy to blame

1382
01:03:29,535 --> 01:03:30,815
You know gerrymandering on the APA

1383
01:03:31,071 --> 01:03:31,839
Opposite party

1384
01:03:32,095 --> 01:03:32,607
Both party

1385
01:03:34,143 --> 01:03:35,167
Ship negotiation

1386
01:03:35,935 --> 01:03:37,983
No ultimately whenever the

1387
01:03:38,239 --> 01:03:40,543
So you can you can always find this s***

1388
01:03:40,799 --> 01:03:41,567
Somewhere where it's like

1389
01:03:41,823 --> 01:03:43,103
And people say there's no difference

1390
01:03:43,359 --> 01:03:44,127
Between Democrats and

1391
01:03:44,383 --> 01:03:46,687
Republicans when you go into certain social

1392
01:03:47,199 --> 01:03:48,735
Which is absolutely true

1393
01:03:49,247 --> 01:03:52,319
The problem is that the underlying factors which

1394
01:03:52,831 --> 01:03:54,111
Contributed to those social issues

1395
01:03:54,623 --> 01:03:57,183
Those are the things that Democrats and Republicans

1396
01:03:57,439 --> 01:03:59,231
Have ideologically agreed on

1397
01:04:00,255 --> 01:04:01,791
When you talk about

1398
01:04:02,047 --> 01:04:05,375
African-American rights in regards to

1399
01:04:05,887 --> 01:04:09,471
Just police shootings and the way that they're incarcerated at a higher rate

1400
01:04:10,239 --> 01:04:10,751
Yeah

1401
01:04:11,007 --> 01:04:11,775
Democrats

1402
01:04:12,031 --> 01:04:13,567
Don't want that to occur

1403
01:04:13,823 --> 01:04:17,407
That's part of the reason

1404
01:04:17,663 --> 01:04:20,479
Like that's the reason that people say there's no difference

1405
01:04:20,735 --> 01:04:22,015
Between Democrats and Republicans

1406
01:04:22,271 --> 01:04:25,343
Is because sure you can reactively say

1407
01:04:25,599 --> 01:04:27,391
That we don't want all of this shift

1408
01:04:28,159 --> 01:04:30,463
But if you are part of the reason it happened

1409
01:04:30,719 --> 01:04:33,279
Then you got a lot of s*** that you should be fighting for

1410
01:04:33,535 --> 01:04:34,047
Much harder

1411
01:04:34,303 --> 01:04:35,327
Yeah I agree

1412
01:04:35,583 --> 01:04:36,095
Agree

1413
01:04:36,351 --> 01:04:36,863
Wholehearted

1414
01:04:37,887 --> 01:04:39,167
I will see what happened

1415
01:04:39,423 --> 01:04:41,471
I hope everyone gets on board with

1416
01:04:41,727 --> 01:04:42,239
Something

1417
01:04:42,751 --> 01:04:46,591
It's going to be reactive Americans always

1418
01:04:46,847 --> 01:04:48,127
To be proactive

1419
01:04:49,663 --> 01:04:50,943
To the next clip

1420
01:04:51,199 --> 01:04:56,319
Andis Clipper Alexander

1421
01:04:58,111 --> 01:05:02,975
My name is Andrea Fantasia and I'm the host of the Russian dancer my show is about geopolitics

1422
01:05:03,231 --> 01:05:04,511
Strategy and diplomacy

1423
01:05:04,767 --> 01:05:06,303
And we regularly follow you

1424
01:05:07,327 --> 01:05:10,399
Can you call Lisette Infowars including your presence on social media

1425
01:05:11,423 --> 01:05:16,031
They should be another translator with subtitles

1426
01:05:16,287 --> 01:05:18,847
Coming from the swamp

1427
01:05:19,359 --> 01:05:20,127
Kevin Nealon

1428
01:05:21,151 --> 01:05:22,431
But after Clinton loss

1429
01:05:22,943 --> 01:05:24,479
They weren't able to accept it

1430
01:05:25,503 --> 01:05:26,783
It seems they don't have the

1431
01:05:27,039 --> 01:05:29,087
The strength of mind to recognize their defeat

1432
01:05:30,367 --> 01:05:36,255
Facts about somebody else's involvement

1433
01:05:36,511 --> 01:05:38,559
An independent American Patriots media

1434
01:05:39,327 --> 01:05:43,679
What they're really winning a bit Americans underestimated Russia's abilities

1435
01:05:44,191 --> 01:05:47,519
That's what their product is happening in America

1436
01:05:51,103 --> 01:05:52,639
The same Civil War

1437
01:05:52,895 --> 01:05:53,919
Is happening in Europe

1438
01:05:56,223 --> 01:05:58,527
The same Civil War

1439
01:05:58,783 --> 01:06:01,855
Which was started 16 years ago in our country

1440
01:06:02,879 --> 01:06:05,951
Also been Victorious

1441
01:06:06,463 --> 01:06:08,511
That's why we understand

1442
01:06:08,767 --> 01:06:12,095
That today we are all in the same situation

1443
01:06:12,351 --> 01:06:15,679
Weather at the Russians Americans or Europeans

1444
01:06:15,935 --> 01:06:16,703
The globalist

1445
01:06:17,727 --> 01:06:19,263
Represent America

1446
01:06:19,519 --> 01:06:22,079
They are the enemy of the American people

1447
01:06:22,335 --> 01:06:23,615
And when you tell me

1448
01:06:25,407 --> 01:06:26,687
Address in your supporters

1449
01:06:26,943 --> 01:06:28,479
It sounds like a call to

1450
01:06:28,735 --> 01:06:30,783
All the people worldwide

1451
01:06:31,039 --> 01:06:32,319
To shake off

1452
01:06:32,575 --> 01:06:34,879
The dominance of the globalist delete

1453
01:06:35,391 --> 01:06:37,951
And established in each of our countries

1454
01:06:38,463 --> 01:06:39,487
Our own

1455
01:06:39,999 --> 01:06:41,791
American order in America

1456
01:06:42,303 --> 01:06:44,095
Russian order in Russia

1457
01:06:44,351 --> 01:06:46,399
Turkish order in Turkey

1458
01:06:46,655 --> 01:06:48,703
Elvis Warren struggle

1459
01:06:48,959 --> 01:06:50,239
Is what unites us

1460
01:06:50,751 --> 01:06:56,895
Interesting that turkey was your third and turkey was the other

1461
01:07:04,063 --> 01:07:10,207
You realize they were all

1462
01:07:15,583 --> 01:07:17,119
Briar true certain point

1463
01:07:17,375 --> 01:07:18,911
The global Corporation

1464
01:07:19,423 --> 01:07:21,215
Transnational corporations

1465
01:07:21,727 --> 01:07:23,007
The globalist elites

1466
01:07:23,775 --> 01:07:27,103
Were presented to us as the voice of the United States

1467
01:07:29,151 --> 01:07:31,199
But thanks to Trump's victory

1468
01:07:31,455 --> 01:07:32,223
We now know

1469
01:07:32,479 --> 01:07:34,271
That there's an RV

1470
01:07:34,527 --> 01:07:37,599
Between the American people that's you.

1471
01:07:37,855 --> 01:07:41,183
Those who are the resistance to the globalist dictatorship

1472
01:07:43,999 --> 01:07:44,767
Which organized

1473
01:07:45,023 --> 01:07:46,559
Color revolutions against

1474
01:07:47,583 --> 01:07:49,119
Still not regular paper

1475
01:07:49,375 --> 01:07:50,399
The soros's

1476
01:07:50,655 --> 01:07:51,167
The Clinton

1477
01:07:51,423 --> 01:07:52,959
The Obama Administration

1478
01:07:53,215 --> 01:07:54,495
The so-called

1479
01:07:54,751 --> 01:07:55,263
State

1480
01:07:57,055 --> 01:08:02,175
Call revolutions against Trump refusing to recognize the Democratic victory

1481
01:08:02,431 --> 01:08:05,247
Of the American people

1482
01:08:05,503 --> 01:08:07,039
Well but also

1483
01:08:07,551 --> 01:08:11,135
I mean you want to

1484
01:08:12,159 --> 01:08:13,695
This this argument of

1485
01:08:14,463 --> 01:08:15,231
Lamented

1486
01:08:15,487 --> 01:08:16,255
Color Revolution

1487
01:08:16,767 --> 01:08:17,279
Another country

1488
01:08:17,791 --> 01:08:18,303
Is not accurate

1489
01:08:18,815 --> 01:08:20,863
But that's not entirely

1490
01:08:21,887 --> 01:08:27,775
Did there's a difference between cement exam and supported people

1491
01:08:28,031 --> 01:08:29,567
There's a

1492
01:08:32,127 --> 01:08:33,151
There has been an attempt

1493
01:08:33,407 --> 01:08:35,455
To make a color revolution in America

1494
01:08:35,967 --> 01:08:36,479
Trump

1495
01:08:36,735 --> 01:08:40,575
At this point in history after the election there was only the women's March

1496
01:08:40,831 --> 01:08:41,855
And the immediate

1497
01:08:42,111 --> 01:08:43,135
Anti-trump March

1498
01:08:44,927 --> 01:08:47,487
Color Revolution

1499
01:08:47,743 --> 01:08:48,255
Which is

1500
01:08:48,511 --> 01:08:52,351
Pretty well covered under the amendment

1501
01:08:52,863 --> 01:08:54,655
We only like the second

1502
01:08:54,911 --> 01:08:57,471
But you understand what I'm saying this underlies

1503
01:08:57,727 --> 01:08:59,263
Of course we'll visit underlies that

1504
01:08:59,519 --> 01:09:00,799
There is a

1505
01:09:01,311 --> 01:09:02,847
There is a there's a perception

1506
01:09:03,103 --> 01:09:05,151
Peaceful protesting is a color red

1507
01:09:05,663 --> 01:09:08,223
If you believe that you have to believe that

1508
01:09:08,479 --> 01:09:10,527
What they're complaining about in these other

1509
01:09:10,783 --> 01:09:11,295
Countries

1510
01:09:11,551 --> 01:09:13,087
Georgia for example

1511
01:09:13,599 --> 01:09:15,135
Iran Ukraine

1512
01:09:16,415 --> 01:09:17,695
Color revolutions that have

1513
01:09:17,951 --> 01:09:23,327
Probably we're just peaceful protest

1514
01:09:23,839 --> 01:09:25,119
Cuz everybody

1515
01:09:25,375 --> 01:09:31,519
Wilbur Ross

1516
01:09:35,103 --> 01:09:36,895
Oh man I can't wait

1517
01:09:37,663 --> 01:09:38,431
And all of us

1518
01:09:38,687 --> 01:09:42,015
United have to think about how we can resist

1519
01:09:42,271 --> 01:09:43,039
This Elite

1520
01:09:43,551 --> 01:09:44,831
The people

1521
01:09:45,599 --> 01:09:48,671
Values

1522
01:09:49,439 --> 01:09:51,487
Have to engage in dialogue

1523
01:09:52,255 --> 01:09:56,095
In terms of what do we want to build instead of globalism

1524
01:09:57,119 --> 01:10:01,471
Another globalism

1525
01:10:01,983 --> 01:10:03,775
Not in a position to Russia

1526
01:10:04,799 --> 01:10:06,847
Not in a position to Turkey

1527
01:10:07,871 --> 01:10:11,199
Each other to protect

1528
01:10:11,455 --> 01:10:13,503
Are narrow national interests

1529
01:10:14,015 --> 01:10:16,319
Which is what the globalist imposing us

1530
01:10:17,343 --> 01:10:19,391
The fight with each other a civil war

1531
01:10:19,903 --> 01:10:21,183
We have to avoid

1532
01:10:21,951 --> 01:10:25,279
Still not allowed and dialogue

1533
01:10:25,535 --> 01:10:26,047
Between us

1534
01:10:27,327 --> 01:10:30,655
Exchange of ideas and different values

1535
01:10:30,911 --> 01:10:33,215
Oh man he must be pissed

1536
01:10:33,471 --> 01:10:35,519
No he looks like he's going to cry

1537
01:10:35,775 --> 01:10:37,311
He never let people talk

1538
01:10:44,991 --> 01:10:46,783
Saying you're the best

1539
01:10:47,295 --> 01:10:47,807
Probably can

1540
01:10:48,063 --> 01:10:48,575
Fused

1541
01:10:49,087 --> 01:10:51,135
Is there being espoused

1542
01:10:51,647 --> 01:10:56,255
Even Alex doesn't go that far but he triggered like there's a lot of words that trigger have my globalist

1543
01:10:57,791 --> 01:10:58,815
I've also realized

1544
01:10:59,071 --> 01:11:00,095
I should just kill myself after this

1545
01:11:00,863 --> 01:11:02,911
I love how Alexander Dugan says globalist

1546
01:11:03,167 --> 01:11:04,447
That's what I kind of said global

1547
01:11:04,703 --> 01:11:07,007
Whatever I say

1548
01:11:07,519 --> 01:11:11,359
I kind of do that I kind of do a little do you like to do a little

1549
01:11:12,127 --> 01:11:15,455
He's triggered by those words and when everybody's just saying there's a

1550
01:11:16,223 --> 01:11:17,247
What is snowflake

1551
01:11:20,063 --> 01:11:23,647
You guys are so right I am awesome I am awesome

1552
01:11:24,159 --> 01:11:25,951
It's like he's getting a Lifetime Achievement Award

1553
01:11:26,207 --> 01:11:31,327
Culmination

1554
01:11:31,839 --> 01:11:32,351
His career mode

1555
01:11:32,607 --> 01:11:33,631
Most likely

1556
01:11:33,887 --> 01:11:34,655
Not realizing

1557
01:11:36,703 --> 01:11:38,239
Not realizing that that's a

1558
01:11:38,495 --> 01:11:39,007
The bad thing

1559
01:11:39,263 --> 01:11:45,407
Want to reach the culmination of his career this way exactly

1560
01:11:45,919 --> 01:11:47,711
The end of his career as well

1561
01:11:49,503 --> 01:11:51,551
Want to wrestle with the fact that like

1562
01:11:53,087 --> 01:11:53,599
He would be a

1563
01:11:53,855 --> 01:11:54,623
Ashamed of himself

1564
01:11:56,159 --> 01:11:57,183
5 years in the past

1565
01:11:57,439 --> 01:11:58,719
Looking at what you've become

1566
01:11:59,487 --> 01:12:00,255
Yeah I do believe

1567
01:12:00,767 --> 01:12:06,143
You think so is because we go back and look at the 2012 version of him before he was Hawking these weird

1568
01:12:06,399 --> 01:12:06,911
Supplements

1569
01:12:07,423 --> 01:12:09,471
You just had these fun

1570
01:12:09,983 --> 01:12:15,359
Big Berkey Water Filter cam

1571
01:12:15,615 --> 01:12:16,895
Movie Pitch

1572
01:12:17,151 --> 01:12:17,663
Alright

1573
01:12:17,919 --> 01:12:20,223
This is all a dream

1574
01:12:20,479 --> 01:12:20,991
He had

1575
01:12:21,247 --> 01:12:23,039
When he was underneath that

1576
01:12:23,295 --> 01:12:25,343
House is toxic

1577
01:12:25,599 --> 01:12:31,743
Exactly

1578
01:12:31,999 --> 01:12:36,351
Christmas Carol

1579
01:12:36,607 --> 01:12:38,143
The ghost of Buckley which by the way

1580
01:12:38,655 --> 01:12:41,471
Buckley is never Buckley's been dead since Alex

1581
01:12:41,727 --> 01:12:42,495
Goodnight

1582
01:12:45,055 --> 01:12:47,615
Then we got the other three ghosts Larry Nichols

1583
01:12:47,871 --> 01:12:48,895
Ghost of Christmas Past

1584
01:12:49,151 --> 01:12:54,271
Ghost of Christmas in Arkansas pass

1585
01:12:54,783 --> 01:12:57,855
Totally

1586
01:12:58,111 --> 01:13:01,695
No knowledge fight grave

1587
01:13:06,303 --> 01:13:09,375
Goodnight baby I think Stone in pieczenik should be present

1588
01:13:09,631 --> 01:13:15,775
Location of script for A Christmas Carol

1589
01:13:16,031 --> 01:13:17,055
Bring a little bit

1590
01:13:17,567 --> 01:13:22,175
Because the old guy like Statler and Waldorf

1591
01:13:22,687 --> 01:13:25,247
I'm Sam the eagle

1592
01:13:25,759 --> 01:13:28,319
Christmas Carol

1593
01:13:31,135 --> 01:13:32,415
A muppet nationalism Christmas

1594
01:13:32,671 --> 01:13:34,207
Mascaro

1595
01:13:34,975 --> 01:13:37,279
Alexander Dugan has

1596
01:13:37,791 --> 01:13:39,583
Really just hung the balls

1597
01:13:40,095 --> 01:13:40,607
Play the Nazi

1598
01:13:41,119 --> 01:13:41,631
The Green Room

1599
01:13:47,263 --> 01:13:50,335
Jean-Luc

1600
01:13:50,591 --> 01:13:51,615
Patrick Stewart

1601
01:13:53,407 --> 01:13:56,479
Reminder highly recommend

1602
01:14:00,575 --> 01:14:01,343
Alia shawkat

1603
01:14:01,599 --> 01:14:02,623
Shock Hattiesburg

1604
01:14:03,903 --> 01:14:04,671
Development fantastic

1605
01:14:04,927 --> 01:14:07,231
So eventually Alex Jones Doug

1606
01:14:23,871 --> 01:14:24,639
I don't have a crystal ball

1607
01:14:32,063 --> 01:14:32,575
The public like

1608
01:14:34,623 --> 01:14:36,159
Actually how they end the books with

1609
01:14:36,415 --> 01:14:37,183
The maniacal laugh

1610
01:14:37,439 --> 01:14:39,743
Dugan has got to be laughing in the middle of this energy

1611
01:14:40,767 --> 01:14:43,071
Because I married this from this big think article

1612
01:14:43,583 --> 01:14:48,447
Dugan might Advocate specifically we can look to his best-selling book the foundation of geopolitics

1613
01:14:48,703 --> 01:14:49,983
1997

1614
01:14:50,239 --> 01:14:52,287
Particular success among Russian military

1615
01:14:52,543 --> 01:14:57,663
According to foreign policy

1616
01:14:58,431 --> 01:15:02,527
The book outlines a vision for Russia in the 21st century they would lead to your formation

1617
01:15:03,039 --> 01:15:07,135
But also include specific strategies for defeating or neutralizing the United States

1618
01:15:07,647 --> 01:15:10,719
These include destabilization and disinformation campaign

1619
01:15:10,975 --> 01:15:13,791
Using Russian Special Forces and asymmetrical Warfare

1620
01:15:14,303 --> 01:15:17,119
Never happened

1621
01:15:17,375 --> 01:15:17,887
In France

1622
01:15:18,143 --> 01:15:24,031
Never happened as well as for the country itself specifically singling out race relations

1623
01:15:24,287 --> 01:15:28,383
M367 of the first edition of the book

1624
01:15:28,639 --> 01:15:33,247
It is essentially important to introduce geopolitical disorder into internal American activity

1625
01:15:33,503 --> 01:15:36,063
Separatism in F

1626
01:15:36,319 --> 01:15:37,599
Mixed social in radical conflict

1627
01:15:37,855 --> 01:15:39,903
Actively supporting all dissident

1628
01:15:40,159 --> 01:15:41,439
Couldn't match

1629
01:15:41,695 --> 01:15:42,463
Sectarian groups

1630
01:15:42,719 --> 01:15:47,071
Destabilizing internal political process in the United States

1631
01:15:47,327 --> 01:15:53,215
Also support isolationist tendencies in American politics

1632
01:15:57,567 --> 01:15:58,079
About this

1633
01:15:58,335 --> 01:16:04,479
Alex Jones is going on 20 years ago

1634
01:16:06,015 --> 01:16:12,159
If we had

1635
01:16:12,415 --> 01:16:17,791
Has Alexandra show

1636
01:16:20,095 --> 01:16:24,703
I mean there are Russian companies that paid for a troll account that

1637
01:16:24,959 --> 01:16:26,239
Specifically fermented

1638
01:16:26,495 --> 01:16:32,639
Race division on website

1639
01:16:32,895 --> 01:16:39,039
Facebook setup so no that's how many of them have come out

1640
01:16:40,063 --> 01:16:46,207
We got money from Russian sources Movin no

1641
01:16:46,463 --> 01:16:47,999
Is Ebola

1642
01:16:50,303 --> 01:16:51,839
And a lot of this

1643
01:16:52,095 --> 01:16:53,631
Suspiciously

1644
01:16:53,887 --> 01:16:55,423
The philosophies and the

1645
01:16:55,679 --> 01:17:00,031
Plan laid out by Alexander Dugan in the book that he wrote in 1990

1646
01:17:00,287 --> 01:17:03,103
For Russia in the 21st

1647
01:17:03,359 --> 01:17:03,871
Century

1648
01:17:04,127 --> 01:17:08,223
Also I mean if you want to talk about these like asymmetrical Warfare

1649
01:17:08,479 --> 01:17:10,271
Kick it better than Infowars

1650
01:17:10,527 --> 01:17:15,903
No in terms of what we've been talking about your enemies as demons

1651
01:17:16,159 --> 01:17:19,743
But when you start talking about literal asymmetrical

1652
01:17:20,255 --> 01:17:21,791
What else could you describe Syria

1653
01:17:22,559 --> 01:17:23,839
Russia doesn't

1654
01:17:24,095 --> 01:17:24,863
Really have anything

1655
01:17:25,119 --> 01:17:31,263
To gain from fighting in Syria or even

1656
01:17:31,519 --> 01:17:37,407
We're not going to do this

1657
01:17:37,919 --> 01:17:39,455
I don't think anybody would really notice

1658
01:17:39,711 --> 01:17:41,247
Except for this area Do or Die

1659
01:17:41,503 --> 01:17:42,783
Right.

1660
01:17:44,319 --> 01:17:46,111
It would be it would be like

1661
01:17:46,367 --> 01:17:49,439
Because we really don't have any

1662
01:17:49,695 --> 01:17:50,207
Nothing to gain from it

1663
01:17:50,463 --> 01:17:52,511
Not just that but where you to depose

1664
01:17:52,767 --> 01:17:58,911
Hydro putting somebody else guess what we would still be able to negotiate a contract with

1665
01:17:59,167 --> 01:18:03,519
Guess what you guys don't f****** live near here what are you doing here

1666
01:18:03,775 --> 01:18:07,103
That's the larger question that we should be asked what is

1667
01:18:10,175 --> 01:18:12,991
Find a note

1668
01:18:13,247 --> 01:18:14,015
At the same time

1669
01:18:14,271 --> 01:18:20,415
We f****** bombed hospital so what do you what do you say about America

1670
01:18:20,671 --> 01:18:22,207
Beyond

1671
01:18:22,463 --> 01:18:24,511
Geopolitical reasons why

1672
01:18:24,767 --> 01:18:30,911
Incredibly important

1673
01:18:31,167 --> 01:18:37,055
Got a comical in a certain level

1674
01:18:38,079 --> 01:18:40,895
And a lot of it is laid out in Alexandria

1675
01:18:41,151 --> 01:18:42,943
And Alex saying

1676
01:18:43,199 --> 01:18:47,807
Getting on the show and talk about David Rockefellers book brzezinski's books

1677
01:18:48,063 --> 01:18:54,207
Or you know that the job Beholder in textbook that he always busy

1678
01:18:54,463 --> 01:18:56,255
These things and lie don't say what he act

1679
01:18:56,511 --> 01:18:57,279
Like they say

1680
01:18:57,535 --> 01:18:58,815
So the fact that he

1681
01:18:59,071 --> 01:19:05,215
He's like talking about how these globalist put out these things about how they're going to poison the water supply and I think you're too stupid

1682
01:19:05,471 --> 01:19:05,983
To read them

1683
01:19:06,751 --> 01:19:08,287
Alex you're misrepresenting those

1684
01:19:08,543 --> 01:19:10,847
Meanwhile the guy that you're talking to

1685
01:19:11,359 --> 01:19:12,639
Didn't put out a book

1686
01:19:12,895 --> 01:19:19,039
This very clearly unfortunately we couldn't have known until now has laid out

1687
01:19:19,295 --> 01:19:21,087
Texas last year

1688
01:19:21,599 --> 01:19:22,879
You were a part of it

1689
01:19:23,391 --> 01:19:25,439
You are a f****** part of it Alex

1690
01:19:25,695 --> 01:19:26,207
That'll be

1691
01:19:27,231 --> 01:19:29,535
Interesting to see in the history books written by of course the

1692
01:19:30,047 --> 01:19:32,095
People who survived in our post climate change world

1693
01:19:32,351 --> 01:19:36,703
No more humans are on their face

1694
01:19:36,959 --> 01:19:43,103
Will have lifted up the sea-level to the point where they can live anywhere

1695
01:19:45,663 --> 01:19:47,199
Believable

1696
01:19:47,711 --> 01:19:49,247
Planet of the Fishman

1697
01:19:49,503 --> 01:19:51,551
Totally forbidden zone.

1698
01:19:51,807 --> 01:19:53,855
Different the underwater

1699
01:19:54,367 --> 01:19:54,879
End up a bit

1700
01:19:58,719 --> 01:20:00,255
No

1701
01:20:01,023 --> 01:20:02,559
The history books it seems like

1702
01:20:03,071 --> 01:20:04,607
Dugan should play

1703
01:20:04,863 --> 01:20:05,631
Such a huge

1704
01:20:06,655 --> 01:20:07,423
In this

1705
01:20:11,007 --> 01:20:14,080
Just in case we're trying to

1706
01:20:14,336 --> 01:20:15,872
Mastermind

1707
01:20:16,128 --> 01:20:18,688
Nothing like that.

1708
01:20:18,944 --> 01:20:19,712
More important

1709
01:20:19,968 --> 01:20:23,296
Figures that I'm unaware of who espoused similar things

1710
01:20:24,320 --> 01:20:25,344
That's entirely possible

1711
01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:29,440
The only the only reason comes up so much

1712
01:20:29,696 --> 01:20:31,488
In terms of our investigation

1713
01:20:31,744 --> 01:20:33,280
He is a very legitimate

1714
01:20:33,536 --> 01:20:35,072
Philosopher

1715
01:20:35,328 --> 01:20:35,840
Putting out

1716
01:20:36,096 --> 01:20:36,864
Philosophy books

1717
01:20:37,376 --> 01:20:39,680
Geopolitical strategy book

1718
01:20:39,936 --> 01:20:40,448
And

1719
01:20:40,704 --> 01:20:41,472
Exist

1720
01:20:41,728 --> 01:20:42,496
Infowars

1721
01:20:43,008 --> 01:20:45,056
He exists as someone who Alex Jones

1722
01:20:45,312 --> 01:20:46,080
Clearly is interact

1723
01:20:46,336 --> 01:20:49,408
He's on Alex's show Alex has been on his show

1724
01:20:49,664 --> 01:20:51,456
The fact that he's on

1725
01:20:51,968 --> 01:20:53,760
Alexander Dugan show Fairly

1726
01:20:54,016 --> 01:20:55,040
Close after

1727
01:20:55,296 --> 01:20:57,600
The election means to contact

1728
01:20:59,392 --> 01:20:59,904
And

1729
01:21:00,160 --> 01:21:01,952
Like not it only that

1730
01:21:02,208 --> 01:21:04,000
I have to assume that other people

1731
01:21:04,256 --> 01:21:05,536
Did Alex Jones is in

1732
01:21:06,560 --> 01:21:07,840
Who is the reward in touch with rice

1733
01:21:08,096 --> 01:21:09,888
People like the Paul Craig Roberts

1734
01:21:10,144 --> 01:21:11,424
People who are they

1735
01:21:11,680 --> 01:21:15,776
On our team that Alex also has on his show

1736
01:21:16,288 --> 01:21:18,336
Those types of people will probably

1737
01:21:18,848 --> 01:21:19,616
I can't

1738
01:21:20,128 --> 01:21:20,896
SeaWorld

1739
01:21:21,152 --> 01:21:22,176
Where there isn't

1740
01:21:23,456 --> 01:21:25,248
Some communication between

1741
01:21:25,760 --> 01:21:28,576
These folks

1742
01:21:28,832 --> 01:21:29,344
Conspiracy

1743
01:21:29,600 --> 01:21:30,112
It just means

1744
01:21:30,368 --> 01:21:31,392
They were in contact book

1745
01:21:31,648 --> 01:21:34,464
Before the reveal

1746
01:21:34,720 --> 01:21:40,864
Depressed doesn't work which is Alex going on

1747
01:21:42,912 --> 01:21:45,216
He should be in the Heinrich Himmler role

1748
01:21:45,472 --> 01:21:49,056
You know music like there's a certain part of all of this that can be

1749
01:21:49,312 --> 01:21:50,848
Traced directly back to

1750
01:21:51,616 --> 01:21:52,640
His

1751
01:21:52,896 --> 01:21:53,408
His idea

1752
01:21:53,920 --> 01:21:54,944
Yeah and if his

1753
01:21:55,200 --> 01:22:01,088
Building on other people's ideas of course course

1754
01:22:01,344 --> 01:22:05,440
It's tough to get away from that

1755
01:22:05,696 --> 01:22:06,464
These things

1756
01:22:06,720 --> 01:22:08,000
Vicky has espoused

1757
01:22:08,512 --> 01:22:13,632
Since 1997

1758
01:22:16,192 --> 01:22:17,472
I mean it's a solid

1759
01:22:17,728 --> 01:22:18,240
Planets

1760
01:22:18,752 --> 01:22:19,264
In the past

1761
01:22:19,520 --> 01:22:22,080
Hanna smaller-scale this is what

1762
01:22:22,336 --> 01:22:23,360
It's been pulled off on a global

1763
01:22:24,128 --> 01:22:24,896
I would I would

1764
01:22:25,152 --> 01:22:26,176
I would not think

1765
01:22:28,224 --> 01:22:30,528
Venezuela

1766
01:22:30,784 --> 01:22:32,832
Yeah like it's essentially the same

1767
01:22:33,344 --> 01:22:38,208
Exactly

1768
01:22:43,072 --> 01:22:43,840
I thought we got that

1769
01:22:44,608 --> 01:22:45,376
Is my lived I'm very sad

1770
01:22:46,400 --> 01:22:48,704
Everybody

1771
01:22:51,264 --> 01:22:53,056
One last clip of Alex's

1772
01:22:53,312 --> 01:22:54,080
Appearance on Alex

1773
01:22:55,616 --> 01:22:56,384
It's a it's a

1774
01:22:56,896 --> 01:22:57,664
Just the Wang Chung

1775
01:22:57,920 --> 01:22:58,432
Because Alex

1776
01:22:59,456 --> 01:23:00,224
Baby Alive

1777
01:23:00,480 --> 01:23:03,296
He switches into Alex on Infowars mode

1778
01:23:03,552 --> 01:23:06,880
Okay because we get to see some of the narratives

1779
01:23:07,136 --> 01:23:08,672
But he spouts on Infowars

1780
01:23:08,928 --> 01:23:12,768
Unresponsive

1781
01:23:13,024 --> 01:23:15,584
You can hear stuff in the background that's cuz

1782
01:23:15,840 --> 01:23:16,608
They have a translator

1783
01:23:16,864 --> 01:23:18,400
Does Dugan doesn't speak English

1784
01:23:18,656 --> 01:23:19,680
Speaks Russian

1785
01:23:19,936 --> 01:23:24,032
And some english in the background from a translator

1786
01:23:31,456 --> 01:23:31,968
Apopka

1787
01:23:39,136 --> 01:23:40,160
Yeah it's 41

1788
01:23:41,184 --> 01:23:42,208
That's why it's so exciting

1789
01:23:42,720 --> 01:23:43,488
Does she

1790
01:23:45,792 --> 01:23:47,072
Information Age

1791
01:23:47,584 --> 01:23:48,352
And seeing the internet

1792
01:23:53,472 --> 01:23:53,984
Control

1793
01:23:54,240 --> 01:23:55,008
I'm sitting at all

1794
01:23:55,264 --> 01:23:56,288
Blow up in their face

1795
01:23:56,544 --> 01:23:57,056
It's a very

1796
01:23:58,848 --> 01:23:59,872
We have the initiative

1797
01:24:00,384 --> 01:24:00,896
We just can't

1798
01:24:01,408 --> 01:24:02,176
Globalist

1799
01:24:12,672 --> 01:24:13,696
If you would have had nukes

1800
01:24:19,072 --> 01:24:19,584
Psyche

1801
01:24:21,888 --> 01:24:22,656
In their power

1802
01:24:23,168 --> 01:24:23,680
Like

1803
01:24:25,216 --> 01:24:25,728
Child

1804
01:24:25,984 --> 01:24:32,128
Calling Jojo

1805
01:24:33,152 --> 01:24:34,944
Dictator who is clearly

1806
01:24:35,200 --> 01:24:37,504
Cleverer than most of the other

1807
01:24:37,760 --> 01:24:39,296
World leaders that were dealing with

1808
01:24:39,808 --> 01:24:40,320
His

1809
01:24:40,832 --> 01:24:41,856
Rampant James

1810
01:24:42,112 --> 01:24:43,648
He's bonvillain ass.

1811
01:24:43,904 --> 01:24:44,672
But also

1812
01:24:45,184 --> 01:24:46,720
This underlies something that Alex

1813
01:24:47,232 --> 01:24:48,000
Talked about

1814
01:24:48,512 --> 01:24:50,816
Hitler

1815
01:24:51,072 --> 01:24:55,168
Metaphor unfortunately

1816
01:24:55,680 --> 01:24:58,496
Presupposes Trump isn't going to behave like

1817
01:24:58,752 --> 01:25:00,032
Also

1818
01:25:00,288 --> 01:25:05,152
Proposal

1819
01:25:05,408 --> 01:25:07,200
But if Hitler

1820
01:25:07,712 --> 01:25:10,016
I'm ambiguous on whether or not

1821
01:25:10,272 --> 01:25:12,576
I care about whether or not Hitler

1822
01:25:13,600 --> 01:25:14,880
I'm inclined to believe you didn't

1823
01:25:15,136 --> 01:25:18,208
I liked

1824
01:25:18,464 --> 01:25:20,000
In Brazil

1825
01:25:22,048 --> 01:25:24,608
I'm inclined to believe he didn't but if you did

1826
01:25:25,120 --> 01:25:26,144
Cool if you did

1827
01:25:26,400 --> 01:25:28,704
Also I mean we have much bigger issues

1828
01:25:29,216 --> 01:25:31,008
Project Paperclip doesn't exist

1829
01:25:31,264 --> 01:25:32,800
But that was real

1830
01:25:33,056 --> 01:25:34,080
Hitler is still alive

1831
01:25:34,336 --> 01:25:40,480
We have a timer

1832
01:25:40,736 --> 01:25:44,576
Oh no

1833
01:25:45,856 --> 01:25:46,368
You know what the bed

1834
01:25:46,624 --> 01:25:47,136
Best way to

1835
01:25:47,392 --> 01:25:47,904
Yourself

1836
01:25:48,672 --> 01:25:49,952
Become Russian

1837
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,304
Is holographic Medved survived

1838
01:25:56,352 --> 01:25:59,168
Actually you know what I'm going to go with Rex Tillerson

1839
01:25:59,424 --> 01:26:00,704
Boys from Brazil

1840
01:26:00,960 --> 01:26:01,472
The clone of Hitler

1841
01:26:01,728 --> 01:26:03,520
Wallpaper

1842
01:26:03,776 --> 01:26:05,056
The idea that like

1843
01:26:05,312 --> 01:26:09,920
Hitler did survive and live

1844
01:26:10,432 --> 01:26:10,944
We have

1845
01:26:11,200 --> 01:26:12,992
We have so many

1846
01:26:13,248 --> 01:26:14,528
People who should have been punished

1847
01:26:15,040 --> 01:26:16,832
Because they have scientific expertise and

1848
01:26:17,088 --> 01:26:20,416
Russia to absorb them

1849
01:26:20,672 --> 01:26:25,536
We did we did a ton of that in the idea

1850
01:26:25,792 --> 01:26:28,608
In in historical hindsight but if it did happen

1851
01:26:29,120 --> 01:26:30,656
They just sort of Falls in line with

1852
01:26:30,912 --> 01:26:31,936
We clearly weren't really

1853
01:26:32,192 --> 01:26:33,472
Jefferson punishing anybody

1854
01:26:33,728 --> 01:26:35,008
If they had something to offer

1855
01:26:36,800 --> 01:26:39,360
The Nuremberg trials

1856
01:26:39,616 --> 01:26:43,456
Like the CIA would have lied about that I don't really think of

1857
01:26:47,296 --> 01:26:50,368
South America and lived out his years as some sort of like fake money

1858
01:26:50,624 --> 01:26:51,136
Or whatever

1859
01:26:51,392 --> 01:26:53,952
I believe that's what some people

1860
01:26:54,208 --> 01:26:55,232
Believe

1861
01:26:55,488 --> 01:26:56,000
I haven't done

1862
01:26:56,256 --> 01:26:57,024
To deeper dive into

1863
01:26:57,536 --> 01:27:00,096
But if they did lie about it and say that he died

1864
01:27:00,864 --> 01:27:01,632
I really think that's

1865
01:27:02,912 --> 01:27:04,704
I think history should correct it

1866
01:27:04,960 --> 01:27:05,984
But at the same time

1867
01:27:06,240 --> 01:27:07,264
I don't think that's my fair

1868
01:27:07,776 --> 01:27:10,080
Right because for National morality is a good

1869
01:27:10,336 --> 01:27:11,360
Thing to believe

1870
01:27:11,872 --> 01:27:12,384
That he died

1871
01:27:12,640 --> 01:27:14,432
So you're saying that Osama bin Laden

1872
01:27:15,456 --> 01:27:15,968
Yeah

1873
01:27:16,736 --> 01:27:19,808
Even South America getting it tonight

1874
01:27:20,832 --> 01:27:21,344
Whip It

1875
01:27:28,768 --> 01:27:29,792
That the TV show

1876
01:27:30,304 --> 01:27:31,584
That's like a real world

1877
01:27:33,376 --> 01:27:36,960
What happened

1878
01:27:37,728 --> 01:27:39,520
End up living.

1879
01:27:41,312 --> 01:27:41,824
Quest

1880
01:27:42,080 --> 01:27:42,848
Control

1881
01:27:43,360 --> 01:27:45,408
Then keep on willing German.

1882
01:27:47,456 --> 01:27:47,968
Too drunk

1883
01:27:48,480 --> 01:27:48,992
Military

1884
01:27:49,248 --> 01:27:50,528

Russia

1886
01:27:59,744 --> 01:28:00,256
From there

1887
01:28:01,536 --> 01:28:02,560
Selectivity

1888
01:28:04,608 --> 01:28:06,400
One question

1889
01:28:07,680 --> 01:28:08,704
My question

1890
01:28:12,288 --> 01:28:12,800
Over

1891
01:28:15,872 --> 01:28:16,384
Type

1892
01:28:16,896 --> 01:28:17,408
Russia

1893
01:28:19,456 --> 01:28:20,992
Great question

1894
01:28:23,040 --> 01:28:23,552
No

1895
01:28:24,832 --> 01:28:25,344
Voided

1896
01:28:27,904 --> 01:28:34,048
Corrupt

1897
01:28:34,304 --> 01:28:36,096
Power in Russia for a Time

1898
01:28:36,352 --> 01:28:38,912
But Didi idea

1899
01:28:40,448 --> 01:28:41,728
The longest-running

1900
01:28:42,752 --> 01:28:43,264
Stretch

1901
01:28:43,520 --> 01:28:45,312
Government

1902
01:28:45,824 --> 01:28:46,848
And continues

1903
01:28:47,360 --> 01:28:48,896
Man they are amazing

1904
01:28:50,944 --> 01:28:51,968
I want to point out the

1905
01:28:52,224 --> 01:28:52,736
True,

1906
01:28:53,760 --> 01:28:54,784
Alex Jones

1907
01:28:55,040 --> 01:28:56,576
Being on Russian television

1908
01:28:56,832 --> 01:28:58,624
And some guy asked them

1909
01:28:59,136 --> 01:29:00,928
How do you disabuse yourself

1910
01:29:01,184 --> 01:29:02,464
Of the wrong notion

1911
01:29:02,720 --> 01:29:05,280
That Russia is still the Soviet Union

1912
01:29:05,792 --> 01:29:07,072
On the show

1913
01:29:07,328 --> 01:29:13,472
Who has exposed the creation of the Eurasian Union which is essentially the

1914
01:29:13,728 --> 01:29:15,776
Re-creation of the Soviet Union

1915
01:29:17,312 --> 01:29:23,200
That's bizarre

1916
01:29:23,456 --> 01:29:25,504
That's almost in incredulos question

1917
01:29:25,760 --> 01:29:26,784
From them like

1918
01:29:27,296 --> 01:29:29,856
How do you lie to yourself

1919
01:29:30,368 --> 01:29:36,512
About what we're doing that's how I heard it

1920
01:29:36,768 --> 01:29:42,912
How are you so stupid the most obvious

1921
01:29:43,424 --> 01:29:49,568
I scroll back and possibly too far but let's listen to the tone of that again cuz I don't think that's kind of

1922
01:29:49,824 --> 01:29:51,104
Hamster correct

1923
01:29:52,384 --> 01:29:55,200
How do you free yourself from the nose of the wrong notion

1924
01:29:57,760 --> 01:29:59,040
TriHealth

1925
01:29:59,296 --> 01:29:59,808
Question for you

1926
01:30:00,832 --> 01:30:01,856
My question

1927
01:30:03,136 --> 01:30:03,648
How

1928
01:30:04,416 --> 01:30:04,928

What we always

1947
01:31:44,256 --> 01:31:45,792
Oh you're so close

And only killed

1955
01:32:31,872 --> 01:32:34,432
What you guys don't talk about that

1956
01:32:35,456 --> 01:32:36,480
Missouri

1957
01:32:38,528 --> 01:32:39,296

Jumbo jet

1959
01:32:40,576 --> 01:32:41,344
We fundamentally

1960
01:32:45,952 --> 01:32:46,464
The

01:32:46,976 --> 01:32:48,768

Deeply racist past

1970
01:33:29,216 --> 01:33:34,336
Also some good ideas about non-interventionism and I would have you

1971
01:33:34,848 --> 01:33:39,200
Makeup

1972
01:33:39,456 --> 01:33:44,576
Live through the gulag winner of 6

Stacks

1974
01:33:48,160 --> 01:33:49,696
Strange

1975
01:33:50,464 --> 01:33:56,352
Eclipse that we have but as a little bit of a punchline I'm going to go through some of these

1976
01:33:56,864 --> 01:33:58,656
IRT videos

1977
01:34:00,960 --> 01:34:01,728
From because

1978
01:34:03,776 --> 01:34:05,312
I can't I can't

1979
01:34:11,712 --> 01:34:12,992
Eclipse put out by Arty

1980
01:34:13,504 --> 01:34:14,272
With Alex Jones

1981
01:34:14,528 --> 01:34:16,320
And these are the headlines that they've given

1982
01:34:16,832 --> 01:34:18,112
As if they're using him

1983
01:34:18,368 --> 01:34:18,880
As

1984
01:34:19,904 --> 01:34:20,416
Again.

1985
01:34:20,672 --> 01:34:21,952
The UN is a Nazi movie

1986
01:34:22,464 --> 01:34:24,000
The UN needs to be abolished

1987
01:34:25,280 --> 01:34:25,792
Alex Jones

01:34:26,048 --> 01:34:27,840
Texas secession

1989
01:34:28,608 --> 01:34:33,472
Where's the one who was created by the CIA

1990
01:34:34,496 --> 01:34:38,592
They just posted a clip of him getting in a fight with anti-trump protesters

1991
01:34:40,128 --> 01:34:42,176
Them calling

1992

Gay rituals at Bohemian Grove

1993
01:34:46,272 --> 01:34:47,808
The media put a spin on wikileak

Total control grid design to predict the future

1995
01:34:51,648 --> 01:34:53,952
There's one in here

1996
01:34:55,232 --> 01:34:55,744
Related

1997
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:57,024
The others in the same way

1998
01:34:57,280 --> 01:34:58,560
No I can't

1999
01:34:59,072 --> 01:35:00,352

In Norway

2009
01:35:29,024 --> 01:35:35,168
Other people have hailed as a hero for his

2010
01:35:35,424 --> 01:35:36,704
F****** white supremacist Bowl

2011
01:35:37,216 --> 01:35:43,360

Call Joseph libertarian blogger

2014
01:35:53,088 --> 01:35:57,696
Free bloggers I don't think that we proved anything necessarily in this

2015
01:35:57,952 --> 01:35:59,744
Exploration of Alex Jones As Time on

2016
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:03,328

Where you at where you at

2019

You remember if you haven't heard any of this

2021
01:36:11,520 --> 01:36:14,592
Remember

Remember how eventually

2025
01:36:23,808 --> 01:36:24,576
Get to the point

2026
01:36:24,832 --> 01:36:25,344
Where

2027
01:36:28,160 --> 01:36:29,440
Elmer Fudd

2028
01:36:29,696 --> 01:36:30,464
Daffy Duck

2029
01:36:30,720 --> 01:36:31,744
Okay has put up

2030
01:36:32,512 --> 01:36:33,024
A million different

2031
01:36:33,280 --> 01:36:33,792
Print signs

2032
01:36:34,560 --> 01:36:35,584
All shaped like arrows

2033
01:36:36,096 --> 01:36:36,864
Pointing directly

2034
01:36:37,120 --> 01:36:38,912
Play towards Bugs Bunny's hole

2035
01:36:39,424 --> 01:36:39,936
Rabbit

2036
01:36:40,448 --> 01:36:40,960
Yeah hell yeah

2037
01:36:41,984 --> 01:36:48,128
That's where I'm at how you feel inside of the rabbit hole

2038
01:36:49,408 --> 01:36:55,040
A million sign where one particular rabbit

2039
01:36:55,296 --> 01:36:56,832
Maybe sitting smugly

2040
01:36:57,088 --> 01:36:57,856
Chewing Auto Care

2041
01:37:01,184 --> 01:37:02,208
I mean it's not

2042
01:37:05,024 --> 01:37:07,328
The rabbit is

2043
01:37:07,584 --> 01:37:10,144
The dumb idiot

2044
01:37:10,912 --> 01:37:14,240
Confused by whoever saying rabbits are Looney Tunes

2045
01:37:14,496 --> 01:37:19,104
Metaphors going to fall apart

2046
01:37:20,896 --> 01:37:26,272
That's all folks

2047
01:37:26,528 --> 01:37:27,296
Every nuke

2048
01:37:27,552 --> 01:37:28,320
Go off in the background

2049
01:37:29,600 --> 01:37:31,392
Roman I mean it's

2050
01:37:31,648 --> 01:37:32,928
It's a bummer but it doesn't

2051
01:37:33,696 --> 01:37:36,256
Tumi doctor Infowars or how I learned

2052
01:37:36,512 --> 01:37:42,656
To stop worrying and love the

2053
01:37:42,912 --> 01:37:43,680
Like all of this

2054
01:37:43,936 --> 01:37:44,448
Just

2055
01:37:45,216 --> 01:37:47,776
Just mirrors all the stuff we've already seen on his own show

2056
01:37:48,032 --> 01:37:50,080
But it's interesting to look at what

2057
01:37:50,336 --> 01:37:51,360
He is willing to say

2058
01:37:52,640 --> 01:37:53,664
Where he's at

2059
01:37:54,176 --> 01:37:54,688
14in

2060
01:37:55,712 --> 01:37:56,736
Enough just for it

2061
01:37:57,504 --> 01:37:58,784
It's foreign media run

2062
01:37:59,040 --> 01:38:00,064
In this case by

2063
01:38:00,576 --> 01:38:01,600
Stayed on propaganda

2064
01:38:02,368 --> 01:38:03,392
And a

2065
01:38:04,160 --> 01:38:06,464
Philosopher who has espoused

2066
01:38:06,976 --> 01:38:08,256
Plans to crush

2067
01:38:08,512 --> 01:38:11,584
America or neutralize America parents

2068
01:38:12,608 --> 01:38:13,120
Resemblance

2069
01:38:13,376 --> 01:38:14,400
Two plans that were affected

2070
01:38:14,656 --> 01:38:16,192
Correctly and when you look at

2071
01:38:16,704 --> 01:38:18,496
The fact that he is willing to

2072
01:38:18,752 --> 01:38:19,776
Push the Russian

2073
01:38:20,032 --> 01:38:22,336
Version of history on Russian television

2074
01:38:22,848 --> 01:38:23,360
And

2075
01:38:23,616 --> 01:38:24,128
RT

2076
01:38:24,384 --> 01:38:24,896
Is now

2077
01:38:25,408 --> 01:38:26,432
Been forced to

2078
01:38:26,688 --> 01:38:27,456
No signup

2079
01:38:27,712 --> 01:38:28,736
As a foreign agent

2080
01:38:28,992 --> 01:38:29,760
Right

2081
01:38:30,784 --> 01:38:31,552
It's it's

2082
01:38:32,064 --> 01:38:33,600
It's bad it's a bad look

2083
01:38:33,856 --> 01:38:34,368
Well when you talk

2084
01:38:34,880 --> 01:38:35,392
About

2085
01:38:35,648 --> 01:38:36,160
Collusion

2086
01:38:40,768 --> 01:38:41,536
So what

2087
01:38:41,792 --> 01:38:42,816
What exactly

2088
01:38:43,840 --> 01:38:44,608
Is the difference

2089
01:38:44,864 --> 01:38:45,632
Between collusion

2090
01:38:46,144 --> 01:38:46,656
And cooperate

2091
01:38:47,168 --> 01:38:48,704
Right now collusion with the

2092
01:38:48,960 --> 01:38:49,472
Suggest that

2093
01:38:49,728 --> 01:38:51,776
Prior to pulling off all of these narrow

2094
01:38:52,544 --> 01:38:53,824
They discussed

2095
01:38:54,336 --> 01:38:54,848
And

2096
01:38:56,384 --> 01:38:57,920
Bright

2097
01:38:58,176 --> 01:38:58,688
Similar Thai

2098
01:38:59,456 --> 01:39:00,224
At the same time

2099
01:39:01,248 --> 01:39:02,272
Cooperation

2100
01:39:02,528 --> 01:39:03,296
Suggest

2101
01:39:03,552 --> 01:39:05,344
See this person with similar motive

2102
01:39:05,600 --> 01:39:06,880
I'm going to amplify

2103
01:39:07,392 --> 01:39:08,928
She sees me with similar motives

2104
01:39:09,184 --> 01:39:09,696
Ivan app

2105
01:39:09,952 --> 01:39:11,232
Amplifier

2106
01:39:11,488 --> 01:39:12,512
No it's not a crime

2107
01:39:12,768 --> 01:39:13,792
But in

2108
01:39:14,048 --> 01:39:14,560
Fact

2109
01:39:14,816 --> 01:39:15,840
The same result

2110
01:39:16,096 --> 01:39:17,376
Yeah

2111
01:39:17,632 --> 01:39:18,144
Cares

2112
01:39:18,400 --> 01:39:21,728
What is whether or not it is collusion a cooperation

2113
01:39:21,984 --> 01:39:23,264
They need to be fought at

2114
01:39:23,520 --> 01:39:25,568
And destroyed in the same regard

2115
01:39:25,824 --> 01:39:28,128
So whether or not the one

2116
01:39:28,384 --> 01:39:29,920
Whatever you want to say that Alex's

2117
01:39:30,176 --> 01:39:31,200
Is on the payroll

2118
01:39:32,480 --> 01:39:35,040
Immaterial to actually solve

2119
01:39:35,296 --> 01:39:36,832
Tissue which is that Alex

2120
01:39:37,088 --> 01:39:38,368
Is beholden

2121
01:39:38,624 --> 01:39:39,392
At least

2122
01:39:39,648 --> 01:39:41,696
Ultimately is on the payroll

2123
01:39:41,952 --> 01:39:44,256
Like whenever you get an

2124
01:39:44,512 --> 01:39:45,792
Inflated viewership number

2125
01:39:46,048 --> 01:39:50,400
You're going to get better abs

2126
01:39:50,656 --> 01:39:51,424
What

2127
01:39:51,680 --> 01:39:53,472
Bowser in the same way that Trump got

2128
01:39:53,728 --> 01:39:57,824
Two billion dollars worth of free advertisement

2129
01:39:58,080 --> 01:40:00,896
In the same way it doesn't matter

2130
01:40:01,152 --> 01:40:04,736
Where or whether or not it's a direct payout it is

2131
01:40:04,992 --> 01:40:11,136
Still a payout even talks about that like if you go and watch MSNBC or NBC

2132
01:40:11,392 --> 01:40:11,904
See your feet

2133
01:40:12,160 --> 01:40:13,184
It's for Northrop Grumman

2134
01:40:13,440 --> 01:40:16,000
And it's like what they're trying to sweat

2135
01:40:16,256 --> 01:40:22,144
Consumer can give them

2136
01:40:22,400 --> 01:40:24,192
Okay Alex your

2137
01:40:25,728 --> 01:40:29,312
Think about that take a step back

2138
01:40:29,568 --> 01:40:31,360
So yeah I mean there are

2139
01:40:31,616 --> 01:40:32,384
Different ways of

2140
01:40:32,896 --> 01:40:33,664
Of looking at it

2141
01:40:33,920 --> 01:40:35,968
I agree that the

2142
01:40:36,224 --> 01:40:38,528
Nothing both of it or not super important

2143
01:40:38,784 --> 01:40:41,344
What is super important is that

2144
01:40:41,856 --> 01:40:42,368
Yeah

2145
01:40:44,160 --> 01:40:44,928
And the fact

2146
01:40:46,464 --> 01:40:47,232
Unfortunately

2147
01:40:47,744 --> 01:40:48,512
Where we are now

2148
01:40:50,560 --> 01:40:52,096
To why the Democratic Party

2149
01:40:52,608 --> 01:40:53,632
Such a

2150
01:40:55,424 --> 01:40:56,192
Virtual group

2151
01:40:56,448 --> 01:40:59,008
Was people at least at the top and a lot of them

2152
01:40:59,520 --> 01:41:02,080
Yeah exactly because this story

2153
01:41:02,336 --> 01:41:05,664
Right in front of everyone's faces

2154
01:41:05,920 --> 01:41:06,944
Two billionaire

2155
01:41:07,968 --> 01:41:09,760
It always comes back to the Oliver

2156
01:41:10,528 --> 01:41:11,808
Take me to be dis

2157
01:41:12,064 --> 01:41:15,392
Stride that's ultimately what democratic socialism

2158
01:41:15,648 --> 01:41:17,440
That's the goal at the end of it

2159
01:41:18,208 --> 01:41:20,256
We can't have this level of inequality

2160
01:41:20,512 --> 01:41:22,048
Because that leads to an inequality

2161
01:41:22,816 --> 01:41:24,352
Yeah that's the whole point

2162
01:41:24,608 --> 01:41:25,632
Well it's one of them

2163
01:41:25,888 --> 01:41:26,656
It's one of the main point

2164
01:41:26,912 --> 01:41:28,704
It's from it's from which

2165
01:41:28,960 --> 01:41:30,752
You find so many other

2166
01:41:31,008 --> 01:41:33,568
Socially are social justice

2167
01:41:33,824 --> 01:41:34,592
This platform

2168
01:41:34,848 --> 01:41:36,128
Once you once you

2169
01:41:36,384 --> 01:41:37,408
Span power

2170
01:41:37,664 --> 01:41:39,712
To a farm or equivalent

2171
01:41:40,480 --> 01:41:43,040
You wind up finding many of those other issue

2172
01:41:43,552 --> 01:41:45,088
Are solved along the way

2173
01:41:45,600 --> 01:41:49,184
Unfortunately we can still

2174
01:41:49,952 --> 01:41:53,024
We all can kind of diagnosis like we can all

2175
01:41:53,280 --> 01:41:55,072
We're all aware that

2176
01:41:55,328 --> 01:42:00,448
The problem even news

2177
01:42:00,704 --> 01:42:01,472
The issue is

2178
01:42:01,728 --> 01:42:02,496
Like with the opioid

2179
01:42:02,752 --> 01:42:07,616
Prices regardless of whether or not you are on the right or the left everybody is aware

2180
01:42:07,872 --> 01:42:09,152
People are overdosing

2181
01:42:10,432 --> 01:42:13,504
That there was a massive advertisement

2182
01:42:14,272 --> 01:42:15,808
Based on these company

2183
01:42:16,064 --> 01:42:17,600
Movies that wanted to sell

2184
01:42:26,304 --> 01:42:27,072
In their pocket

2185
01:42:27,328 --> 01:42:28,096
We all know that

2186
01:42:29,120 --> 01:42:29,632
They're just

2187
01:42:29,888 --> 01:42:30,656
So smart

2188
01:42:30,912 --> 01:42:31,936
At least there

2189
01:42:32,704 --> 01:42:33,472
Never enough

2190
01:42:33,728 --> 01:42:35,008
They have a low-level Cana

2191
01:42:35,776 --> 01:42:36,544
To convince

2192
01:42:36,800 --> 01:42:38,848
A massive section of the population

2193
01:42:39,104 --> 01:42:40,128
That it is in fact

2194
01:42:40,384 --> 01:42:41,408
To the people who are trying

2195
01:42:41,664 --> 01:42:42,176
To help them

2196
01:42:42,432 --> 01:42:43,712
Who are the cause of their

2197
01:42:44,736 --> 01:42:48,832
The sleight-of-hand that will disc

2198
01:42:49,088 --> 01:42:49,856
Destroy the human race

2199
01:42:50,112 --> 01:42:51,648
Well the sleight-of-hand to Alex's

2200
01:42:52,160 --> 01:42:55,488
Portion of it these ads that are all like

2201
01:42:55,744 --> 01:42:56,512
Conservatism

2202
01:42:56,768 --> 01:43:00,864
Is the counterculture

2203
01:43:01,120 --> 01:43:02,400
When in reality

2204
01:43:02,656 --> 01:43:03,680
Even with Trump

2205
01:43:04,704 --> 01:43:05,216
Really

2206
01:43:06,240 --> 01:43:08,544
It's just the maintenance of Agro status quo

2207
01:43:09,312 --> 01:43:11,104
It's not really eat Trump isn't

2208
01:43:11,872 --> 01:43:13,152
Counterculture

2209
01:43:13,664 --> 01:43:14,432
He's not really

2210
01:43:14,688 --> 01:43:15,712
Fighting globalist

2211
01:43:15,968 --> 01:43:16,480
New

2212
01:43:16,736 --> 01:43:20,064
Like he's he's on board with a lot of the things that I like

2213
01:43:21,600 --> 01:43:25,696
Nevada

2214
01:43:25,952 --> 01:43:27,488
5 out of his eight cabinet

2215
01:43:27,744 --> 01:43:30,304
Members were Goldman Sachs people

2216
01:43:30,560 --> 01:43:31,840
Yeah it did

2217
01:43:32,352 --> 01:43:33,376
It's nonsensical.

2218
01:43:37,728 --> 01:43:38,240
Dangerous

2219
01:43:38,496 --> 01:43:39,776
I think he does agree with that

2220
01:43:40,032 --> 01:43:41,312
Exxon

2221
01:43:42,080 --> 01:43:43,872
Some of the geopolitical ideas

2222
01:43:44,128 --> 01:43:46,176
He has in terms of power

2223
01:43:46,432 --> 01:43:46,944
Right

2224
01:43:52,576 --> 01:43:54,880
I came to me we've gone over this already even in this episode

2225
01:43:55,136 --> 01:43:58,208
Problematic

2226
01:43:58,464 --> 01:44:00,000
Come up

2227
01:44:00,256 --> 01:44:01,024
No matter what

2228
01:44:01,280 --> 01:44:03,072
Alignment you have right

2229
01:44:03,328 --> 01:44:05,120
Nationalism globalism

2230
01:44:05,632 --> 01:44:06,656
You would have that body

2231
01:44:06,912 --> 01:44:08,192
In some form or another

2232
01:44:08,704 --> 01:44:09,472
What were

2233
01:44:09,728 --> 01:44:10,752
Finding out with

2234
01:44:11,008 --> 01:44:11,520
Trump

2235
01:44:12,288 --> 01:44:13,312
Is that

2236
01:44:13,568 --> 01:44:14,592
We can either fight

2237
01:44:14,848 --> 01:44:15,872
Domestic policy

2238
01:44:17,920 --> 01:44:18,432
We can't

2239
01:44:18,688 --> 01:44:19,456
Successfully fight

2240
01:44:20,480 --> 01:44:21,248
Like on domestic

2241
01:44:21,504 --> 01:44:22,016
Policy

2242
01:44:22,272 --> 01:44:24,832
We're fighting really hard we're trying to keep

2243
01:44:25,088 --> 01:44:25,600
Healthcare

2244
01:44:25,856 --> 01:44:26,368
We're trying right

2245
01:44:26,624 --> 01:44:28,160
Keep them from destroying the tax

2246
01:44:28,416 --> 01:44:30,208
At the same time

2247
01:44:30,464 --> 01:44:31,488
They are dismantle

2248
01:44:31,744 --> 01:44:33,024
Yeah they are

2249
01:44:33,280 --> 01:44:39,424
Dismantling who are literally people who got there

2250
01:44:39,680 --> 01:44:40,192
Facebook

2251
01:44:40,448 --> 01:44:40,960
Which is

2252
01:44:41,216 --> 01:44:42,752
And that's something

2253
01:44:43,008 --> 01:44:46,080
Thing that is in the news that we won't even remember neck

2254
01:44:46,336 --> 01:44:52,480
No I have no idea because we're going to be off on why is the why is he

2255
01:44:52,736 --> 01:44:58,112
Why did Roy Moore still win

2256
01:44:58,624 --> 01:45:00,160
Keep going

2257
01:45:00,416 --> 01:45:02,976
You can fight one or the other but when were fighting both

2258
01:45:03,232 --> 01:45:05,024
We're going to wind up losing on both front

2259
01:45:05,280 --> 01:45:05,792
Yeah

2260
01:45:06,560 --> 01:45:08,352
Noel

2261
01:45:08,608 --> 01:45:10,144
But that's what that is

2262
01:45:11,680 --> 01:45:12,704
The neutralization

2263
01:45:12,960 --> 01:45:13,728
Of America

2264
01:45:13,984 --> 01:45:15,264
Yeah that is sought

2265
01:45:15,776 --> 01:45:17,568
Exactly

2266
01:45:18,336 --> 01:45:20,640
Auntie globalist powers

2267
01:45:20,896 --> 01:45:23,712
That really aren't against Global is so much as they are

2268
01:45:23,968 --> 01:45:26,016
Against the encroachment of the UN

2269
01:45:26,272 --> 01:45:26,784
Which is

2270
01:45:28,320 --> 01:45:30,112
Holding up International sanctions

2271
01:45:30,368 --> 01:45:30,880
Against

2272
01:45:31,136 --> 01:45:34,208
Encroaching on your f****** neighbors like you did in Georgia and Ukraine

2273
01:45:34,464 --> 01:45:37,792
Which is even crazier it is

2274
01:45:38,048 --> 01:45:38,816
It is kind of interesting

2275
01:45:39,328 --> 01:45:41,120
Because many of the UN Nation

2276
01:45:41,376 --> 01:45:41,888
10 states

2277
01:45:43,680 --> 01:45:48,544
A spouse that very similar center-right policy

2278
01:45:48,800 --> 01:45:50,848
It's just they don't get their countries back

2279
01:45:51,104 --> 01:45:52,896
Yeah that's the only reason

2280
01:45:53,152 --> 01:45:53,664
Disagreement

2281
01:45:53,920 --> 01:45:56,480
At the end of the day between the klepto fastest un
