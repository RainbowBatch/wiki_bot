1
00:00:21,504 --> 00:00:27,648
I have great respect for knowledge B I'm sick of them posing

2
00:00:34,304 --> 00:00:40,448
MoneyGram

3
00:00:53,504 --> 00:00:57,088
Alex vype.com

4
00:01:07,072 --> 00:01:08,352
Jordans

5
00:01:08,608 --> 00:01:09,120
What

6
00:01:09,632 --> 00:01:10,144
The longest

7
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:10,912
Paper UF

8
00:01:11,936 --> 00:01:14,496
Perhaps.

9
00:01:15,264 --> 00:01:16,544
What was the shortest

10
00:01:17,568 --> 00:01:23,712
No idea no you don't know I remembered you remember specific

11
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:26,272
Papers in college

12
00:01:28,064 --> 00:01:31,136
No

13
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:36,512
I don't have a lot of memories of us like

14
00:01:36,768 --> 00:01:37,280
Papers or anything

15
00:01:39,328 --> 00:01:40,608
Memories of like subject

16
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:43,168
That were covered in the information but not the actual

17
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:49,568
Experience of writing paper or how long it was

18
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:51,360
25000 word paper

19
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:52,896
Of course I'm going to remember that

20
00:01:53,408 --> 00:01:55,456
I forget a lot of weed

21
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:03,904
In college I wrote a lot of papers

22
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,952
And I always did very well with that

23
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:07,488
Very good paper writer

24
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:09,536
Especially back in college

25
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:19,776
Non-Stop

26
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:23,360
A hundred percent

27
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:29,760
Turn papers but I do know a lot about Alex Jones

28
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:35,136
Time frame of September 6th

29
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:36,672
To September 11th

30
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:43,328
2019

31
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:46,400
Your moment

32
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:48,448
But before we do got to take a moment to say thank

33
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:53,824
So first of all thank you so much

34
00:02:57,408 --> 00:02:58,432
Katie

35
00:02:58,688 --> 00:02:59,712
She ran our policy walk

36
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:01,248
I'm a policy wonk

37
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,344
Ralph thank you so much

38
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:13,792
I apologize

39
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:15,072
Pronounce Ralph

40
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:18,912
I didn't mean to I have nothing but respect for the Nobel Ralphs

41
00:03:19,168 --> 00:03:20,192
So the world's like a racket

42
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:20,960
Yes

43
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:21,984
Next

44
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,264
Gunks

45
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:35,552
Alright

46
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:44,000
Amapola

47
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:45,024
Appreciate that very much

48
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,072
So David thank you so much

49
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:48,864
And thank you so much

50
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:50,912
You're both wonderful technocrat

51
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:03,200
Heroin

52
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:07,808
Freakishly large

53
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:19,071
So we wanted to take a little quick moment before we get any further into the show 2

54
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:22,143
Give a little bit of explanation of

55
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:22,911
Some stuff

56
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:25,471
But before we do another context drop

57
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:26,239
Alex Jones

58
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:38,271
He's joking

59
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:41,599
Everybody who listens and everybody who supports

60
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:47,743
It's the show

61
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:50,047
Into this versus the reality of it and it

62
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:52,607
It's overwhelming in many ways

63
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:54,655
The creates the insecurity

64
00:04:56,959 --> 00:05:02,335
Because we do essentially no promotion whatsoever the only reason

65
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:03,359
Does people

66
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:07,455
Been very very supportive

67
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:11,807
We've grown out of the point where we could pursue doing ads on

68
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:14,111
Yeah

69
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:15,903
Probably not too difficult but

70
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:21,535
Both in private conversations

71
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:23,583
Infield fairly similarly

72
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:29,983
With Epson flows perhaps daily mood

73
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:38,175
Especially on a show like are those weird experience

74
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:39,455
For listeners

75
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:43,039
Enjoying it so much you know if we

76
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:46,111
Go with somebody who gets to choose our ads

77
00:05:48,671 --> 00:05:54,815
Infowars I don't want to I don't want to make fun of and Alex

78
00:05:55,071 --> 00:06:01,215
Harry's razors

79
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:03,775
I like

80
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:05,055
Shrek

81
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:11,455
Is there anyways I don't know what they would be served by an advertised

82
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:14,527
Like I'm not entirely sure if anything

83
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:22,207
A+ for the audience and then also the show itself but feel weird

84
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:25,023
We're making a strong commitment

85
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:26,559
Do not taking advertising

86
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:29,119
And being entirely audience

87
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:30,911
Supported as we have been

88
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:35,775
Appreciative

89
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:38,591
Into exactly what today

90
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:39,871
It can be and should be

91
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:50,879
You everyday it would really help

92
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:51,647
Adverb

93
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:54,207
Very very

94
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:57,023
2

95
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:58,303
This sort of thing

96
00:06:58,815 --> 00:07:00,351
So

97
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:03,167
But the average

98
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:05,215
If you look

99
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:06,495
Couple bucks

100
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:07,519
Tacoma policy walk

101
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:14,687
September 6th through the 11th

102
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:16,735
And contacts drops

103
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:29,535
I think that's putting on a

104
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:35,423
Tower I assume talking with Barnes about his

105
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:39,007
Continuing legal travel

106
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:40,287
The barn

107
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:43,615
Does make at least two appearances on this trip

108
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:47,711
Starbucks bar

109
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:48,479
So we started

110
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:53,087
Is in a bit of a weird mood and image clip heat to find leadership

111
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:55,135
But I think I only kept

112
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:56,159
B clip

113
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:58,719
Him because he pronounces some words funny

114
00:07:58,975 --> 00:07:59,743
I kind of enjoyed it

115
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:01,535
Leadership

116
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:07,423
Did you know

117
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:12,799
But end up in the end

118
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:16,639
Launching

119
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:17,407
Home

120
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:18,431
Human

121
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:23,039
Whiteman

122
00:08:24,575 --> 00:08:25,855
Humans

123
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:27,391
And become closer

124
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:29,695
That's leadership

125
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:33,791
Sabotaging culture

126
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:35,839
Deception

127
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:38,655
Evil

128
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:39,935
It's a virus

129
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:41,983
Manipulate system

130
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:44,543
Closet

131
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:46,335
He does not

132
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:47,615
Progenerate

133
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:54,271
It is not a

134
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:03,743
Construct

135
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:05,791
If they build or Burke

136
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:07,327
They are

137
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:16,031
Some of the similar ideas to use the tree of Good and Evil

138
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:21,151
Standing of the Garden of Eden story

139
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:27,039
I like I like that

140
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:28,575
Then this is always true

141
00:09:29,343 --> 00:09:30,623
Nobody is better attic

142
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:31,647
Explaining why Ali

143
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:32,415
Alex is the worst

144
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:33,439
Then Alex

145
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:34,207
What he's talking about

146
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:35,231
What he thinks

147
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:37,791
He literally

148
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:40,351
Just laid out all of the reason

149
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:43,167
I couldn't have put it better myself

150
00:09:43,935 --> 00:09:49,055
Dailymail.com

151
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:50,079
Got the show

152
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:54,687
There's a real f*****-up headspace that we're going to get into

153
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:55,711
When we get to the 11

154
00:09:57,247 --> 00:10:00,831
911 911

155
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:03,903
What does startling revelation

156
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:05,695
But I think people will be very excited to hear

157
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:11,327
I know you probably already believes that's very milquetoast

158
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:19,263
So I think he's in a weird head probably because of things

159
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:20,287
Think about it later

160
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:21,567
Episodes

161
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:22,847
Knows what's going on

162
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:26,431
Comes back from break with some

163
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:27,199
Beatles

164
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:30,271
Emily gets real f****** heady about this man

165
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:44,863
Oh no

166
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:48,191
Wonder what he's talking

167
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:50,495
Drug

168
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:54,847
Greenhill

169
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:59,199
And just lay there for hours

170
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:01,759
Felicia

171
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:06,367
Universe

172
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:07,647
Gods

173
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:08,927
In the front

174
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:12,255
You don't even need to be on LSD

175
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:20,703
The good news is Chill Force works new products

176
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:32,479
I put a lot of it in this

177
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:44,255
Is a diamond lattice

178
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:45,791
Alright

179
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:49,119
So Alex gets out from there but that really trippy

180
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:50,655
College dorm

181
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:53,983
Yeah yeah this is philosophy

182
00:11:59,103 --> 00:12:00,639
And what you do now today

183
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:07,039
Broadcast

184
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:08,319
If you

185
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:10,111
It's not like you're just a leg up

186
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:14,975
You're the whole shooting match

187
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:18,815
If you like

188
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:23,935
Famously today

189
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:28,799
Your Word of Mouth

190
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:35,199
Your son is

191
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:35,967
Central

192
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:42,111
Smooth they want to kill you

193
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:45,439
Both of us are like

194
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:47,999
And

195
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:53,119
There's a real feeling that I have going through this episode of preparing

196
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:54,655
Stream is s***

197
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:57,983
F****** crazy and I'm sitting here

198
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:03,359
Becomes yeah

199
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:08,735
Whether it be from a bigotry standpoint or from a disgusting

200
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:10,783
Performance-based

201
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:17,183
All of our enemies want to kill your children and I'm the one who can stop them

202
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:18,207
One of those weird

203
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:19,487
Improv

204
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:20,511
Quote unquote

205
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:23,071
Sins of what it is

206
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:25,119
In the basement I'm so dumb to it

207
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:28,703
Itsfunneh

208
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:29,727
Both of us kind of like

209
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:40,223
It was non-stop freaking out

210
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:43,039
Even though he's ramped up his rhetoric

211
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:45,599
How much further could you

212
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:49,695
And you're just like alright fine you're disgusting and gross but

213
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:50,719
Move on

214
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:52,767
So what

215
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:58,911
A lot more lately I'm not positive

216
00:13:59,167 --> 00:14:00,191
Part of how he

217
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:01,727
Reframe things earlier in his

218
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:04,799
If he did it was less

219
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:08,383
Frequently but he's putting it in a lot of religious

220
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:09,151
Terms

221
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:10,943
Black people giving him money

222
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:12,991
Okay I'm done plugins

223
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:21,951
Pods for the truth I say

224
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:24,511
Post-birth abortion

225
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:35,775
Still alive

226
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:38,591
Call storytime

227
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:40,127
So

228
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:43,711
It Whatever you've been at it

229
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:44,479
Mayor Pete

230
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:50,879
Because I'm about a Buddha

231
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:54,463
Nope

232
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:58,047
Because I Got High

233
00:14:58,559 --> 00:14:59,327
She's like a megachurch

234
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:00,095
Glitterbug tie

235
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:01,119
Type of guy

236
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:02,143
I don't care

237
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:04,703
I just think it's pretty interesting

238
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:11,103
If you got this framing of stuffing but much more consistently put into the terms of like

239
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:19,039
We are almost it's almost like a religious duty to give Alex 10% of your

240
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:21,343
Upsetting

241
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:22,111
Absolutely

242
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:25,951
So one of the other things It's upsetting is that there seems to be a

243
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:29,535
Trend along with Robert Barnes being on all of the

244
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:34,143
There's another guy who seems to be coming up a lot more freak

245
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:36,447
That is that guy Tom pepper

246
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:38,239
If you recall

247
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:41,311
He is a guy who runs the station at Wichita

248
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:45,407
And I don't I don't know

249
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:50,015
I mean I guess this guy ran a semi popular Trump

250
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:52,831
Facebook page the god Emperor Trump

251
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:56,671
And so that's Alex's way in or whatever but this guy

252
00:15:56,927 --> 00:15:58,207
Must have blackmailed Alex

253
00:15:58,463 --> 00:16:03,327
Because he is on a lot

254
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:04,095
Sorry

255
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:04,863
Jesus

256
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:11,519
So he comes on and he talks about how the Infowars audience has responded two times

257
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:12,287
They have like

258
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:14,847
His TV station has a power blackout

259
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:16,895
Interruption of service

260
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:20,223
I think that if you listen to how he died

261
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:21,503
Describes the audience

262
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:22,271
He wants

263
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:23,807
To put it in terms

264
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:26,623
Very into the programming

265
00:16:27,135 --> 00:16:28,927
Kind of sounds like

266
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:29,951
Paranoid cult

267
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:36,863
They were local TV station so you got movies you've got news you've got Sports you been all kinds of stuff but let me tell you when there is a

268
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:41,215
Bump in the nights when there's a power surge when there's something bad that happened it's not

269
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:45,311
Anybody asking about the movie networking

270
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:51,711
Hundreds and hundreds of calls what happened to Alex

271
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:57,855
Completely unbelievable

272
00:16:58,111 --> 00:16:59,135
They do tide

273
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:02,719
Do the TV station

274
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:07,839
They tired to Tom pappert this is gross

275
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:14,239
Because what he's described exaggerated probably

276
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:15,007
Positive sign

277
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:17,055
Is people like any service interruptions

278
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:21,919
Paranoia

279
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:24,735
That is just bizarre

280
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:26,271
Rough

281
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:30,623
Positive

282
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:34,207
Obsessive weird and

283
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:35,487
Sacrilege

284
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:38,559
Yeah there's no I have a hard time

285
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:45,215
Being the guy who is like how dare you impugn religion you're working again

286
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:47,519
What's the tenant of religion

287
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:53,919
Not my place but just feel for what I remember when I used to go to church

288
00:17:54,175 --> 00:17:55,455
He found a box

289
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:56,223
My church

290
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:57,247
When I was growing up

291
00:17:57,503 --> 00:18:00,063
Was not revealing post-birth abortion

292
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:04,671
They were not telling us all about all of the other b*******

293
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:07,231
But I'm pretty sure the past

294
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:08,511
Pissed off at somebody was

295
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:16,191
Iritis

296
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:19,007
That dude

297
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:22,335
So I probably wouldn't be

298
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:23,359
2 is

299
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:24,639
Tom and Allie

300
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:27,199
Describe

301
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:29,503
Ice-T

302
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:31,295
Little baby indication

303
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:33,343
New top hits

304
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:34,623
Appearances on the

305
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:35,391
Michelle

306
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:36,415
But

307
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:39,999
Kind especially on the September 6th episode

308
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:41,279
Some indication

309
00:18:42,047 --> 00:18:47,935
That this dude

310
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:48,959
Surprise

311
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:51,263
I know.

312
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:57,919
I'm just completely flummoxed by this development

313
00:18:58,175 --> 00:18:58,687
Multi-ethnic

314
00:18:59,199 --> 00:18:59,711
I'm not sure

315
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:06,111
Surround

316
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:08,927
Of carrying out a white genocide

317
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:17,119
That's exactly right

318
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:18,143
100%

319
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:24,543
Tried-and-tested way to destroy civilization across time

320
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:25,311
Intelligent

321
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:27,871
Part of this because

322
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:34,271
Accident in trying to destroy Western countries

323
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:40,671
Lucidly in countries that were settled by high and intelligent individuals

324
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:47,071
Even more direct

325
00:19:47,327 --> 00:19:53,471
The human population okay

326
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:58,591
You catch on that one Bingo metaphorically

327
00:19:58,847 --> 00:20:01,919
I assumed he was including Guatemala in Western

328
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:03,711
I don't know

329
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:08,575
I'm guessing when he said they were settled by

330
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:12,671
High Intelligence individuals and I don't think he was referencing

331
00:20:13,183 --> 00:20:15,231
I don't think so

332
00:20:15,487 --> 00:20:16,255
Specific about who is

333
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:19,071
I feel like there's a lot of

334
00:20:23,167 --> 00:20:23,935
Reinforced

335
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:24,703
5

336
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:30,591
And what happened what's wrong

337
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:43,135
That we're not genetically similar to the government

338
00:20:43,647 --> 00:20:45,183
False

339
00:20:45,695 --> 00:20:48,255
Now I don't want dissertation here

340
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:50,047
Probably

341
00:20:50,303 --> 00:20:56,191
Probably the longest

342
00:20:56,447 --> 00:20:59,007
Add discuss how this broadcast

343
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:03,615
And Alex Jones is worldview is explicitly anti-government

344
00:21:04,383 --> 00:21:04,895
This

345
00:21:05,151 --> 00:21:05,919
Is bizarre

346
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:11,807
For them to be complaining about minority groups coming

347
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:12,575
Crazy

348
00:21:13,087 --> 00:21:19,232
Crazy it's almost as we all know the Roman god

349
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:20,768
Government is famous

350
00:21:21,024 --> 00:21:23,328
All of it

351
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,144
Leaving Rome

352
00:21:26,656 --> 00:21:27,424
It's almost

353
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:33,568
Like these have a very different standard for white people

354
00:21:33,824 --> 00:21:37,408
It's very essential that they fight back against the oppressive government

355
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:39,456
Genetically similar to

356
00:21:39,712 --> 00:21:41,504
Dumas

357
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:47,136
What else has our mentality to see on display like

358
00:21:47,392 --> 00:21:48,672
It would be one thing

359
00:21:48,928 --> 00:21:49,696
Do you know they weren't

360
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,000
All about being against

361
00:21:52,256 --> 00:21:53,024
The government

362
00:21:55,072 --> 00:21:57,376
AR

363
00:21:57,632 --> 00:21:58,144
Poor

364
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:05,312
Yeah that's not very good and how kind of glaring a lot of these holes are

365
00:22:05,568 --> 00:22:07,104
Just in their speech

366
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,384
The surprised they haven't thought

367
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,152
This all the way through

368
00:22:10,176 --> 00:22:15,552
About a video that he found of some person

369
00:22:15,808 --> 00:22:17,856
Being set on fire in South Africa

370
00:22:18,112 --> 00:22:19,136
Okay

371
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:23,744
Decided that one of his kids is going to be like

372
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:24,768
Restarting

373
00:22:26,048 --> 00:22:29,632
I mean metaphorically yeah I guess I kind of

374
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,680
There's a lot of rhetoric that runs

375
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:32,960
Along those lines

376
00:22:35,008 --> 00:22:37,568
Starts talking about how

377
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:41,408
The black smoke in South Africa are races

378
00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:43,200
List against other black people

379
00:22:45,504 --> 00:22:46,272
Cigar just targets

380
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,576
It's complicated

381
00:22:49,088 --> 00:22:50,112
Yes yes

382
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:51,392
A couple problem

383
00:22:51,648 --> 00:22:52,416
Bethesda frame

384
00:23:13,152 --> 00:23:14,688
Little Caesars

385
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,992
One-wheeler in Zulu

386
00:23:17,504 --> 00:23:23,648
So this is a in the middle of tirade that Alex is on

387
00:23:23,904 --> 00:23:25,184
We're horrible anti-white

388
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:29,024
Spinato's

389
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:32,096
Delivering a section of a country called

390
00:23:33,632 --> 00:23:35,424
The first misconception Alex seems to have

391
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:38,240
Is that

392
00:23:38,496 --> 00:23:40,800
Which is actually called kwazulu-natal

393
00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:47,200
Throughout South Africa and elsewhere but if you land on a map

394
00:23:47,456 --> 00:23:51,808
You might get the idea that you are

395
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:55,904
Right

396
00:23:56,160 --> 00:24:01,536
When the British arrived in the late 1800s in South Africa

397
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:04,352
Cinnamon place

398
00:24:06,656 --> 00:24:10,240
Surrender to British rule which these

399
00:24:11,776 --> 00:24:12,800
Give it up to the British

400
00:24:13,056 --> 00:24:14,848
Because they're essentially Somali pirates exist

401
00:24:15,616 --> 00:24:21,760
The British eventually conquered the Zulu nation divided

402
00:24:22,016 --> 00:24:24,320
Most likely because it would be much more easy to manage the

403
00:24:33,792 --> 00:24:34,304
A little while after

404
00:24:34,816 --> 00:24:40,960
This worried the British sense that Alliance would give the boers access to a port which could hurt British trade dominance in the region

405
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,008
Zulu

406
00:24:44,032 --> 00:24:50,176
The most important thing to remember is that the legacy of zulu being forced to live in kwazulu-natal is not the legacy of the

407
00:24:50,944 --> 00:24:52,992
It is the direct result of Apartheid

408
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:57,856
Still in place hundreds of thousands of Zulu

409
00:24:58,112 --> 00:24:59,136
Had their land taken

410
00:24:59,392 --> 00:25:01,440
Forcibly relocated to quads

411
00:25:02,464 --> 00:25:05,792
The idea is to create a semi-autonomous state

412
00:25:06,048 --> 00:25:08,864
Which was still largely controlled by the white power structure

413
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,680
Which would serve as a place for a lot of non-whites to go to

414
00:25:12,192 --> 00:25:15,776
It's not really all that different than any other formulation of white nationalism you

415
00:25:16,288 --> 00:25:17,312
Where you wanting on whites

416
00:25:17,568 --> 00:25:22,176
To go somewhere but on the off-chance

417
00:25:22,432 --> 00:25:23,456
Be clear that you're in charge

418
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,784
Do the displacement of thousands

419
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:29,856
Thousands of zulu to quads

420
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:33,696
The distribution of the population does do pretty heavily towards kwazulu

421
00:25:33,952 --> 00:25:36,512
But it's not the ANC your Nelson Mandela

422
00:25:37,024 --> 00:25:39,328
It was the apartheid government

423
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,680
Send. Completely irresponsible

424
00:25:44,192 --> 00:25:45,728
He's pointing to a direct

425
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:51,872
Of the brutal apartheid system

426
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:53,408
You're in simple

427
00:25:53,664 --> 00:25:56,480
This is an expression of overt white nationalism

428
00:25:56,992 --> 00:25:58,528
And that is the prism through which

429
00:25:58,784 --> 00:25:59,552
He's looking at

430
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:00,832
The world Okay so

431
00:26:01,088 --> 00:26:01,600
Is he

432
00:26:02,112 --> 00:26:02,624
Using this

433
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:08,512
In concert with their other like demographic bulshit where they're saying see look what happened in Africa

434
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:13,120
They let all these white people in and the white people destroyed the entire country

435
00:26:13,888 --> 00:26:16,192
So that's why we can't let people into America

436
00:26:16,704 --> 00:26:17,216
No

437
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:18,496
No he's not making that

438
00:26:19,264 --> 00:26:25,408
No he's arguing that Nelson Mandela and the ANC were the people who put all the Zulu in Zoo

439
00:26:25,664 --> 00:26:28,224
Zululand that's the dumbest thing anybody could say

440
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:33,344
Is unreal use a scribe

441
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:39,744
Blame for that like a geographical relocation that happened during apartheid

442
00:26:40,256 --> 00:26:45,120
So what are you doing people like this look at the world

443
00:26:45,376 --> 00:26:46,144
So

444
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:46,912
It's f***** up

445
00:26:49,728 --> 00:26:50,496
Just went in and f*****

446
00:26:50,752 --> 00:26:56,896
Everything up over and over and over again all across the world

447
00:26:57,152 --> 00:26:58,176
And that was fine

448
00:26:58,944 --> 00:27:01,504
Right in the

449
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:07,392
That's really really negative things that we're done during those periods

450
00:27:07,648 --> 00:27:09,952
The time we're actually done by

451
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:16,608
Africa

452
00:27:16,864 --> 00:27:18,912
We've covered this before in the past

453
00:27:19,168 --> 00:27:20,704
Alex Reid

454
00:27:21,216 --> 00:27:22,752
Understand

455
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:24,800
The genocide in Rwanda

456
00:27:25,568 --> 00:27:27,360
Why why did you go somewhere like

457
00:27:27,872 --> 00:27:28,384
Rwanda

458
00:27:29,152 --> 00:27:30,944
Weather small Christian tribe

459
00:27:31,712 --> 00:27:34,016
Years

460
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:43,744
And they killed the Christian minority

461
00:27:44,256 --> 00:27:44,768
Wendy

462
00:27:46,048 --> 00:27:47,328
First worship

463
00:27:48,608 --> 00:27:51,936
That's really happened absolutely

464
00:27:52,192 --> 00:27:54,496
Stegosaurus has proved anything

465
00:27:54,752 --> 00:27:56,288
The reason that the Tootsie

466
00:27:56,544 --> 00:27:59,872
Had a lot of the property was because they were deemed the

467
00:28:00,128 --> 00:28:02,176
VR the bureaucratic class

468
00:28:02,688 --> 00:28:03,456
By the Bell

469
00:28:03,712 --> 00:28:07,808
Prior to the events

470
00:28:08,064 --> 00:28:09,344
Stanford Prison Experiment

471
00:28:10,624 --> 00:28:12,672
Except

472
00:28:12,928 --> 00:28:15,232
I know but like

473
00:28:15,488 --> 00:28:17,024
That kind of function of like

474
00:28:17,536 --> 00:28:18,048
Almost

475
00:28:18,816 --> 00:28:22,656
Arbitrarily the belgians were just like you so cute

476
00:28:22,912 --> 00:28:25,728
See each other because you are more similar to you

477
00:28:25,984 --> 00:28:27,520
And that is

478
00:28:28,032 --> 00:28:29,312
What Alex's Alex's

479
00:28:29,568 --> 00:28:30,080
Pretending

480
00:28:30,336 --> 00:28:34,432
That you know just one

481
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,992
Similarly

482
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:43,904
MDF

483
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,440
Mr.

484
00:28:45,696 --> 00:28:46,720
Crazy Bowls

485
00:28:47,744 --> 00:28:49,536
White nationalist propaganda of the highest

486
00:28:50,304 --> 00:28:51,072
Right

487
00:28:51,328 --> 00:28:54,144
State Historical inventors

488
00:28:55,424 --> 00:28:56,192
Citizen X

489
00:28:56,448 --> 00:28:56,960
Just kind of dumb

490
00:28:57,984 --> 00:28:58,752
You know

491
00:28:59,008 --> 00:29:00,032
Could always use a little pallet

492
00:29:00,544 --> 00:29:01,056
I guess

493
00:29:06,176 --> 00:29:07,200
These churches

494
00:29:07,456 --> 00:29:09,248
Tell you how moral they are all day

495
00:29:11,552 --> 00:29:14,112
They're probably

496
00:29:17,952 --> 00:29:19,488
Did he just say most

497
00:29:19,744 --> 00:29:25,888
Pastors are closeted I don't know if I don't know what he's exactly saying

498
00:29:26,912 --> 00:29:27,424
Sexuality

499
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:28,448
Insult

500
00:29:28,704 --> 00:29:30,496
It's kind of par for the course for him but

501
00:29:30,752 --> 00:29:32,544
Whatever Alex

502
00:29:33,056 --> 00:29:39,200
Villa Family Show with supervisor Alex picks up this is a family show

503
00:29:39,456 --> 00:29:40,480
Oh boy

504
00:29:40,736 --> 00:29:42,272
Oh that's a good family

505
00:29:42,528 --> 00:29:44,576
Call Larry Graf wall

506
00:29:44,832 --> 00:29:48,928
Call is a guy who came out with some information about him

507
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,744
Supposedly infiltrating The Weather Underground

508
00:29:52,256 --> 00:29:53,024
Back of the seven

509
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:59,936
And he said that they plan

510
00:30:00,192 --> 00:30:00,704
Everybody's

511
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:06,336
Confirm that they were planning to put people in education camps

512
00:30:06,592 --> 00:30:08,128
Who didn't give up on capitalism

513
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,944
And the 25 million or so people would need

514
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:11,712
Killed

515
00:30:11,968 --> 00:30:16,320
And of course Alex confront Weather Underground

516
00:30:16,576 --> 00:30:18,112
Volaris

517
00:30:18,368 --> 00:30:24,512
About this and Bellaire the complaints

518
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:30,656
I never knew he was working for the FBI

519
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:34,752
Take that under advisement and still believe that everything is

520
00:30:35,008 --> 00:30:36,544
A hundred percent true

521
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:39,104
About that a little bit

522
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,896
And then I think that

523
00:30:41,408 --> 00:30:42,688
Tom pappert got

524
00:30:42,944 --> 00:30:43,456
Trolled

525
00:30:43,712 --> 00:30:44,224
Any thinks it's

526
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:44,992
Real

527
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:51,904
Vietnam

528
00:31:05,216 --> 00:31:06,240
Wellness

529
00:31:09,312 --> 00:31:11,616
Assertive

530
00:31:11,872 --> 00:31:12,384
Thomas Wright

531
00:31:20,832 --> 00:31:26,976
Yes we know how the weather underground and their remnants love to

532
00:31:27,232 --> 00:31:29,792
F*** with Alex and comments on YouTube articles

533
00:31:32,352 --> 00:31:34,912
Comment thread on a Yahoo article

534
00:31:35,168 --> 00:31:35,936
That is

535
00:31:36,192 --> 00:31:38,752
Is representative of how the entire

536
00:31:39,008 --> 00:31:39,776
Nation now what

537
00:31:40,032 --> 00:31:40,800
Put

538
00:31:41,056 --> 00:31:42,080
People in forced labor

539
00:31:45,664 --> 00:31:51,808
We're going unacceptable versions of that a little bit later

540
00:31:53,856 --> 00:31:57,184
The purplest internet commentary

541
00:31:57,952 --> 00:32:02,304
Another example

542
00:32:03,328 --> 00:32:05,376
Real dumb dumb thing to say

543
00:32:14,336 --> 00:32:15,360
Fantasizing about

544
00:32:15,616 --> 00:32:21,504
Well

545
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:22,272
Toothpaste

546
00:32:22,528 --> 00:32:28,672
What they're saying is the first

547
00:32:28,928 --> 00:32:33,024
Form design in fruit

548
00:32:36,096 --> 00:32:36,608
Thought

549
00:32:37,376 --> 00:32:43,520
My only question is does Tom pappert sincerely think that these people were for real

550
00:32:43,776 --> 00:32:49,920
I understand that they were f****** around this is a joke

551
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:50,944
Works for me

552
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:54,016
Right

553
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:58,624
The only question I have

554
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:01,440
Or is he aware of his

555
00:33:04,512 --> 00:33:05,792
Because this is

556
00:33:06,048 --> 00:33:08,608
This is a crazy attempt to launder

557
00:33:09,632 --> 00:33:10,144
I guess

558
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:12,704
A f****** dumb internet joke interviewing like

559
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:19,104
These people are sincerely planning on the jobs that they're going to have

560
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:20,128
Call me to take over

561
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:24,224
Why would they have a red arm

562
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,272
Green army

563
00:33:26,784 --> 00:33:28,064
It's f****** insane

564
00:33:28,832 --> 00:33:32,672
Some of those concerns that I had about Tom password having these quite 10

565
00:33:32,928 --> 00:33:37,536
We're really elevated by some comments that he makes

566
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:41,376
Sort of about countries

567
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:44,448
Might as well

568
00:33:45,216 --> 00:33:47,264
This is real fast there

569
00:33:50,848 --> 00:33:53,408
We basically kill ourselves

570
00:34:06,976 --> 00:34:07,488
Iceland

571
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:15,168
Multiculturalism in all of these immigrants who come from completely antithetical

572
00:34:15,424 --> 00:34:19,776
Call Church

573
00:34:21,824 --> 00:34:23,872
Because Kim Jeong Hoon

574
00:34:27,712 --> 00:34:29,760
Kendall Auto indications that West

575
00:34:30,016 --> 00:34:32,576
Man's wife

576
00:34:33,088 --> 00:34:35,648
Very historically Iceland

577
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:36,928
Ethnically speak

578
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:41,536
Economic upturn

579
00:34:41,792 --> 00:34:46,144
In the Icelandic economy which has the effect of drawing people in who are looking for opportunity

580
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,936
Internet

581
00:34:48,192 --> 00:34:49,472
Sensitive to welcome immigrants in

582
00:34:49,728 --> 00:34:50,496
Because their economics

583
00:34:50,752 --> 00:34:51,776
Success is aided by an in

584
00:34:52,032 --> 00:34:53,824
Inflow of Labor

585
00:34:54,592 --> 00:35:00,224
The image of Iceland in ahead of someone like Alex or Tom pappert isn't imagine it's place where everyone is white

586
00:35:00,736 --> 00:35:02,528
2017 census

587
00:35:02,784 --> 00:35:05,856
10.6% of the population of Iceland were first-generation

588
00:35:06,112 --> 00:35:08,160
Immigrant up from 4% in 90

589
00:35:08,416 --> 00:35:08,928
T90

590
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:14,816
What a great difficulty is Big Island 900 Mi away from Norway

591
00:35:15,328 --> 00:35:18,144
Get indictment is a difficult feat for someone trying to

592
00:35:18,912 --> 00:35:20,448
And for many years after the

593
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,752
2008 financial crisis

594
00:35:23,264 --> 00:35:25,568
It wasn't a fight like a hugely appealing option

595
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:29,408
Native-born icelanders took that as a scientist

596
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:30,432
The country

597
00:35:30,944 --> 00:35:34,272
As the economy has Diversified in the tourism sector is skyrocketed

598
00:35:34,528 --> 00:35:36,576
Iceland is a place that looks a lot more

599
00:35:38,112 --> 00:35:39,136
For someone trying to find a place that

600
00:35:39,392 --> 00:35:39,904
Can survive

601
00:35:40,672 --> 00:35:42,464
Iceland is a country with a relatively

602
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:43,488
Small population

603
00:35:43,744 --> 00:35:46,304
And it was starting to replace a very low immigration

604
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:48,352
But as the economy has grown

605
00:35:48,608 --> 00:35:49,888
Exactly the pattern you would expect

606
00:35:50,656 --> 00:35:55,264
This isn't some globalists stronghold in the immigrants who arrived in our from all sorts of culture

607
00:35:55,776 --> 00:35:59,104
Even the ones that Tom dumped her things are incompatible

608
00:35:59,360 --> 00:35:59,872
With the West

609
00:36:00,896 --> 00:36:02,432
Switzerland is even worse example

610
00:36:02,688 --> 00:36:03,200
Over top of you

611
00:36:03,968 --> 00:36:05,504
Switzerland has consistently ranked

612
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:08,832
Very high on the list of countries with the highest proportion of the population

613
00:36:09,088 --> 00:36:09,856
Competing for inborn

614
00:36:10,112 --> 00:36:12,416
With a number sitting at around 23%

615
00:36:12,672 --> 00:36:13,952
Compared to the US at

616
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:14,976
14

617
00:36:15,488 --> 00:36:18,816
EU countries

618
00:36:19,072 --> 00:36:25,216
It's not like all the people who Tom would call Western those the only people were immigrating to

619
00:36:25,472 --> 00:36:26,496
Switzerland

620
00:36:26,752 --> 00:36:30,080
There's a large population of Tamil people who fled the Civil War

621
00:36:30,336 --> 00:36:31,872
Sri Lanka who have resettled in

622
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:35,200
There are a large number of people from Croatia

623
00:36:35,456 --> 00:36:37,248
Serbia has made Switzerland their new home

624
00:36:37,504 --> 00:36:38,784
As well as Filipinos and

625
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,064
Pakistani population

626
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,856
Things that are particularly large

627
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:43,648
What time is it

628
00:36:43,904 --> 00:36:45,696
Is categorically not true but it feels right

629
00:36:45,952 --> 00:36:47,488
The people who yearn to live in a white f

630
00:36:48,512 --> 00:36:51,584
They want it so bad that they have to pretend that their imagined enemies

631
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:53,120
Creative pure Enclave

632
00:36:53,632 --> 00:36:54,400
Without immigrants

633
00:36:54,656 --> 00:36:55,680
Hagen for them

634
00:36:55,936 --> 00:37:01,568
Themselves because

635
00:37:01,824 --> 00:37:03,616
You got to just be surrounded by your own race

636
00:37:04,128 --> 00:37:04,896
They know it

637
00:37:05,664 --> 00:37:08,480
They know what they're keeping it to themselves and Iceland in Switzerland

638
00:37:09,504 --> 00:37:11,296
This is a gigantic red flag

639
00:37:11,552 --> 00:37:12,320
From a white nationalism

640
00:37:12,576 --> 00:37:14,112
The perspective is extremist

641
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,440
Under the guise of

642
00:37:17,696 --> 00:37:19,744
Normal conversation

643
00:37:20,512 --> 00:37:23,072
Also tax rates

644
00:37:23,584 --> 00:37:24,096
A cross

645
00:37:24,864 --> 00:37:25,888
But if you just look at the highest

646
00:37:26,144 --> 00:37:28,448
Lowest tax rate brackets

647
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:29,472
United States

648
00:37:31,008 --> 00:37:33,568
There doesn't appear to be too much to what he saying other than

649
00:37:33,824 --> 00:37:35,104
Feels true to him

650
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,128
Namely that these

651
00:37:36,896 --> 00:37:37,408
Is R1

652
00:37:37,664 --> 00:37:38,944
Associated with whiteness

653
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:40,992
And they're better because of

654
00:37:41,504 --> 00:37:42,016
Jordan

655
00:37:42,272 --> 00:37:44,064
There's a name for that

656
00:37:45,856 --> 00:37:47,392
I'll leave at

657
00:37:51,232 --> 00:37:52,512
I just always want to be there in

658
00:37:53,536 --> 00:37:54,304
Tell me what weather

659
00:37:55,328 --> 00:37:56,096
And you know what

660
00:37:56,352 --> 00:37:57,632
You know and I know it

661
00:37:58,912 --> 00:37:59,424
Just f******

662
00:38:00,192 --> 00:38:04,032
Y'all know

663
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:07,360
What was it

664
00:38:08,384 --> 00:38:09,408
It was like

665
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:14,784
When the volcano erupted

666
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,832
And shut down travel from

667
00:38:17,088 --> 00:38:17,856
Did you came to the United

668
00:38:18,624 --> 00:38:19,392
Iceland

669
00:38:19,648 --> 00:38:21,440
Non-Stop

670
00:38:21,952 --> 00:38:22,464
The next year

671
00:38:23,744 --> 00:38:25,792
Is crazy and of course

672
00:38:28,096 --> 00:38:28,608
And

673
00:38:28,864 --> 00:38:30,912
All of them

674
00:38:35,776 --> 00:38:36,288
Missouri

675
00:38:37,824 --> 00:38:42,432
Absolutely represent the reality that's been the case for a number of years

676
00:38:42,944 --> 00:38:46,016
It's not a globalist plot natural occurrence

677
00:38:46,272 --> 00:38:47,296
Over diversifying

678
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,088
Economy

679
00:38:50,624 --> 00:38:51,904
Perhaps

680
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:53,696
Exploding

681
00:38:53,952 --> 00:38:55,488
Alex just believe that they

682
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:56,512
Shut off valve

683
00:38:56,768 --> 00:38:59,072
Looking Glass

684
00:38:59,328 --> 00:39:01,120
But anything is everything

685
00:39:01,888 --> 00:39:04,448
Talking about

686
00:39:04,704 --> 00:39:09,056
Remember his name that's a democratic donor who would

687
00:39:09,312 --> 00:39:09,824
Bring

688
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,360
African American dudes

689
00:39:11,872 --> 00:39:13,152
To his home and then inject them

690
00:39:15,712 --> 00:39:19,808
He's talking about that

691
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:22,368
Worth talking about really

692
00:39:23,392 --> 00:39:24,416
Spins out

693
00:39:24,672 --> 00:39:25,440
Into sort of

694
00:39:26,208 --> 00:39:27,488
A claim that I don't

695
00:39:33,376 --> 00:39:34,144
Sacrifice

696
00:39:44,128 --> 00:39:44,896
If

697
00:39:46,944 --> 00:39:47,968
Little girls

698
00:39:51,296 --> 00:39:54,112
That's exactly right

699
00:39:54,368 --> 00:39:55,904
Has been proven

700
00:39:56,160 --> 00:40:02,304
Even like

701
00:40:03,584 --> 00:40:09,728
Come on man

702
00:40:09,984 --> 00:40:13,568
It's very weird

703
00:40:13,824 --> 00:40:17,408
The least strange reaction to fit like that

704
00:40:17,664 --> 00:40:20,224
Absolutely right Alex

705
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:21,248
Proven right

706
00:40:21,504 --> 00:40:26,880
Voice

707
00:40:28,416 --> 00:40:32,512
No idea what he's talking about about the Rolling Stones

708
00:40:33,536 --> 00:40:37,376
It's very hard because I kind of think you can

709
00:40:37,632 --> 00:40:38,400
Conflating toothache

710
00:40:39,168 --> 00:40:44,288
The first thing is likely the killing of eighteen-year-old Meredith Hunter at the Rolling Stones concert Altamont

711
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:49,152
That was young black man who died in the proximity of the band I think Alex is taking that

712
00:40:49,408 --> 00:40:51,712
These compliant combining it with another element

713
00:40:51,968 --> 00:40:55,808
Which is the death of Rolling Stones founding member Brian Jones back in night

714
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:56,832
69

715
00:40:57,344 --> 00:41:01,184
Jones was found dead in his pool and the circumstances surrounding the death have been the stuff of

716
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:02,976
Conspiracy theory and conjecture ever

717
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,536
Occam's razor tells us that he was a

718
00:41:05,792 --> 00:41:08,352
Completely insane drug addict Rockstar in the late sixties

719
00:41:08,608 --> 00:41:11,424
Please who was on a path of increasingly self-destructive

720
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:17,824
And him getting f***** up and drowning in his pool accidentally isn't that surprising as a possibility

721
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:20,640
Who else was doing anything like that

722
00:41:20,896 --> 00:41:25,504
Literally everyone

723
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:26,784
Out of control

724
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:29,856
38 other examples of people who died at 33

725
00:41:30,368 --> 00:41:32,416
Is 27

726
00:41:33,696 --> 00:41:37,792
You have the fact also in this case that's a confession that they drowned

727
00:41:38,048 --> 00:41:41,120
And all sorts of other side. About the ritual

728
00:41:41,376 --> 00:41:41,888
Computer

729
00:41:42,144 --> 00:41:45,216
Keith Richards and Mick Jagger fly around all over the place

730
00:41:45,472 --> 00:41:48,800
All this fascinating stuff but ultimately it's not a story I can really just

731
00:41:49,056 --> 00:41:52,128
Contango for you

732
00:41:52,384 --> 00:41:58,271
Combining with Altamont turn it into a story about The Rolling Stones killing a black child at their house

733
00:41:58,527 --> 00:41:59,807
There's something about the globalist

734
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:02,111
LOL so he doesn't put it that way

735
00:42:02,367 --> 00:42:02,879
He says

736
00:42:03,135 --> 00:42:04,927
If you almost blame-the-victim again like

737
00:42:07,999 --> 00:42:13,119
They're just too appealing to the globalist at

738
00:42:13,375 --> 00:42:14,143
Yikes

739
00:42:14,399 --> 00:42:15,679
Yeah there's

740
00:42:15,935 --> 00:42:16,959
That's that's a weird

741
00:42:17,215 --> 00:42:17,727
Yeah

742
00:42:17,983 --> 00:42:24,127
Exclude possibility that there is some like urban legend story about The Rolling Stones that I

743
00:42:24,639 --> 00:42:28,223
Can't find but it makes too much sense

744
00:42:28,479 --> 00:42:29,503
From two different stories

745
00:42:29,759 --> 00:42:32,063
Because that Brian Jones story is very

746
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:37,951
Big in conspiracy theory world's ultimate aware they career

747
00:42:38,207 --> 00:42:39,487
And Alex has a really big on.

748
00:42:41,023 --> 00:42:42,815
South

749
00:42:43,071 --> 00:42:43,839
So many death bed

750
00:42:44,607 --> 00:42:45,375
There's no real

751
00:42:46,399 --> 00:42:47,679
I really think that you shouldn't

752
00:42:48,191 --> 00:42:51,519
Call me for like

753
00:42:51,775 --> 00:42:55,615
Confusion 9/11 last words

754
00:42:56,383 --> 00:42:57,663
Deals economy is going to come in

755
00:42:57,919 --> 00:42:59,199
Finish you off if you do that

756
00:42:59,967 --> 00:43:03,295
So

757
00:43:03,551 --> 00:43:04,831
My Confession has robots

758
00:43:05,087 --> 00:43:07,391
Going to take over there going to kill everyone off

759
00:43:16,095 --> 00:43:16,607
Ron

760
00:43:16,863 --> 00:43:17,375
Until

761
00:43:17,887 --> 00:43:18,911
Billions

762
00:43:22,751 --> 00:43:28,383
Worship the robots on the Bible

763

And it's all going to fall it 1 hour

764
00:43:34,527 --> 00:43:35,807
It's like a computer was

765
00:43:43,231 --> 00:43:43,743
In an hour

766
00:44:06,783 --> 00:44:12,927
Irregular on every TV

767
00:44:13,183 --> 00:44:16,511

768
00:44:16,767 --> 00:44:18,303

00:44:19,583 --> 00:44:24,703
People throw to like a weather of weatherman

770
00:44:24,959 --> 00:44:25,983
Local news just like

771
00:44:26,239 --> 00:44:31,359
In the news today

772
00:44:31,615 --> 00:44:32,127
We are going to

773
00:44:33,663 --> 00:44:39,807
All right damn over to you with whether it's even more brusca

774
00:44:41,087 --> 00:44:43,647
So f***** up

775
00:44:44,159 --> 00:44:48,255
So we have to add to that

776
00:44:51,327 --> 00:44:56,959
Fun dealing with global

777
00:44:57,727 --> 00:45:03,871
Wedgie

778
00:45:05,151 --> 00:45:07,455
For him to prove

779
00:45:07,711 --> 00:45:08,735
So much more interesting

780
00:45:08,991 --> 00:45:09,503
The one I grew

781
00:45:10,015 --> 00:45:10,527
Yeah

782
00:45:11,039 --> 00:45:14,879
Obsolete

783
00:45:15,135 --> 00:45:18,207
Nbcnews

784
00:45:18,463 --> 00:45:19,487
Is to kill you

785
00:45:19,999 --> 00:45:21,279
They're already killing your fertility

786
00:45:24,351 --> 00:45:26,399
That's exactly right

787
00:45:28,447 --> 00:45:31,263
Literally got comes in a booster

788
00:45:46,623 --> 00:45:47,135
You're absolutely

789
00:45:47,391 --> 00:45:50,463
Movie right

790
00:45:50,975 --> 00:45:57,119
Cody it's pretty sad

791
00:46:01,727 --> 00:46:06,335
Has a demonstrable effect on your IQ

792
00:46:06,591 --> 00:46:09,407
You become a Christian your IQ goes up

793
00:46:09,663 --> 00:46:10,175
It's time

794
00:46:12,991 --> 00:46:14,527
And I know that I know that I know

795
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:18,623
I would love to see Alex

796
00:46:18,879 --> 00:46:19,647
Back this up

797
00:46:19,903 --> 00:46:20,671
You can't

798
00:46:21,183 --> 00:46:21,695
He's just talking s***

799
00:46:21,951 --> 00:46:24,767
But this is it

800
00:46:25,023 --> 00:46:25,791
Shades of

801
00:46:26,047 --> 00:46:27,583
Pretty white nationalist weights

802
00:46:27,839 --> 00:46:31,935
Supremacist ask Uncle of

803
00:46:32,191 --> 00:46:33,471
Christian Supremacy

804
00:46:33,727 --> 00:46:36,543
He's indicating in Subway that there is a

805
00:46:37,055 --> 00:46:42,431
Substantive difference between you've a minute before you become a Christian and after

806
00:46:42,687 --> 00:46:43,455
From a

807
00:46:44,735 --> 00:46:45,247
Accused

808
00:46:45,503 --> 00:46:50,879
Sandpoint baptism

809
00:46:52,671 --> 00:46:53,183
It's just like

810
00:46:53,439 --> 00:46:55,743
Hey

811
00:46:55,999 --> 00:46:56,767
Bam I'm a

812
00:46:58,303 --> 00:47:02,655
Alex is an example of somebody who has done all of the

813
00:47:02,911 --> 00:47:03,423
Stewart's

814
00:47:03,679 --> 00:47:05,215
Is Christianity he believes in

815
00:47:05,471 --> 00:47:07,263
He is absolutely someone who

816
00:47:09,311 --> 00:47:10,079
Well and I don't

817
00:47:10,335 --> 00:47:13,663
I see you're very very smart person here

818
00:47:14,175 --> 00:47:15,455
Next Clippers game

819
00:47:17,759 --> 00:47:20,319
He's going to talk about how he

820
00:47:20,575 --> 00:47:22,111
You talked about Fantasy Island

821
00:47:23,647 --> 00:47:24,159
Skylander dad

822
00:47:28,255 --> 00:47:29,279
And after it's done

823
00:47:30,047 --> 00:47:33,887
Tell me if you can guess my theory about why you talking about

824
00:47:36,959 --> 00:47:37,471
Watch

825
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:47,711
Yahoo feed my Google feed on YouTube

826
00:47:47,967 --> 00:47:48,479
I was talking

827
00:47:56,927 --> 00:47:57,951
I'm going to say racist stuff

828
00:47:59,999 --> 00:48:01,535
Phone

829
00:48:08,447 --> 00:48:09,983
Recording

830
00:48:16,383 --> 00:48:22,527
Do you know what my theory is

831
00:48:22,783 --> 00:48:23,551
Something like that

832
00:48:23,807 --> 00:48:29,951
Either that or he looked over to the side and sauce of a mare

833
00:48:30,207 --> 00:48:34,815
The story

834
00:48:38,399 --> 00:48:44,287
The weakest cover 2

835
00:48:44,543 --> 00:48:50,687
F****** worried that I need a context for This Racist I was demonstrating what a racist

836
00:48:50,943 --> 00:48:57,087
Howard Stern's on your phone when you're ready for there you go

837
00:48:57,343 --> 00:49:03,487
Racist I was demonstrating racism

838
00:49:03,743 --> 00:49:04,255
Ben huh

839
00:49:04,767 --> 00:49:09,119
Discover 100%

840
00:49:13,215 --> 00:49:15,519
Lyo him to make this cover story

841
00:49:15,775 --> 00:49:17,055
For his racist outburst

842
00:49:17,567 --> 00:49:19,359
Along with his wife while hiking

843
00:49:19,615 --> 00:49:20,127
In Christ

844
00:49:20,383 --> 00:49:20,895
That's what I

845
00:49:21,663 --> 00:49:24,735
Alex starts freaking out a little bit about his court case

846
00:49:24,991 --> 00:49:28,831
Which I understand why he would do that doesn't look great

847
00:49:29,855 --> 00:49:30,623
On the waterfront

848
00:49:32,671 --> 00:49:33,695
Exactly the direction eunuchs

849
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:47,519
I'm not scared

850
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:04,671
Wow

851
00:50:04,927 --> 00:50:06,207
It's not

852
00:50:07,487 --> 00:50:11,839
Well obviously it's not a depressant or at least it has a

853
00:50:12,095 --> 00:50:13,119
Half-life

854
00:50:17,471 --> 00:50:23,615
Religiousness a little bit earlier and I think that's in that conversation

855
00:50:23,871 --> 00:50:30,015
Only afraid of God

856
00:50:30,271 --> 00:50:36,415
3 second pause

857
00:50:42,303 --> 00:50:43,583
And then you two can fight for

858
00:50:44,351 --> 00:50:46,655
So at this point Tom pepper

859
00:50:46,911 --> 00:50:47,679
Is out of the mix

860
00:50:48,191 --> 00:50:48,959
Alex

861
00:50:49,215 --> 00:50:51,007
Android Studio

862
00:50:51,263 --> 00:50:51,775
Becomes

863
00:50:52,031 --> 00:50:54,079
Incredibly disgraceful

864
00:50:54,591 --> 00:50:55,871
Punching homeless

865
00:50:56,127 --> 00:50:56,895
People section

866
00:50:57,663 --> 00:51:00,735
It just becomes them like yelling about homeless people pooping on the

867
00:51:03,295 --> 00:51:03,807
Turnabout

868
00:51:04,063 --> 00:51:06,879
It's not worth talking about for the most part

869
00:51:07,135 --> 00:51:09,951
Except a couple of really weird things out

870
00:51:10,463 --> 00:51:13,791
And here's the first one has like he has a theory about why

871
00:51:15,071 --> 00:51:15,839
People

872
00:51:16,351 --> 00:51:17,887
Allow homeless people to exist

873
00:51:19,935 --> 00:51:23,775
And then the city council decided to Amanda city ordinance in July

874
00:51:24,031 --> 00:51:26,591
Saying it's not legal to camp out on the city sidewalk

875
00:51:27,103 --> 00:51:30,431
Sleep on it

876
00:51:30,687 --> 00:51:34,783
Anything you want to do it's all good

877
00:51:35,039 --> 00:51:36,319
The restaurant there's eight people

878
00:51:41,183 --> 00:51:43,487
This is going on but it seemingly happen

879
00:51:44,255 --> 00:51:45,023
Overnight

880
00:51:45,535 --> 00:51:48,351
In fact

881
00:51:52,191 --> 00:51:53,727
This is a little demon

882
00:52:19,071 --> 00:52:21,119
He's not kidding

883
00:52:24,191 --> 00:52:26,239
That's important clarification

884
00:52:26,495 --> 00:52:28,543
I'm not f****** around

885
00:52:28,799 --> 00:52:33,919
Lower servant demons which you heard that and what the f*** is he talking about

886
00:52:35,711 --> 00:52:41,855
I am dead serious about low-level demons being needed in order to bring

887
00:52:42,111 --> 00:52:42,623
Level demon

888
00:52:44,159 --> 00:52:44,671
Yikes

889
00:52:45,183 --> 00:52:46,463
You know what you know what am I cute

890
00:52:47,231 --> 00:52:47,743
Don't

891
00:52:49,791 --> 00:52:55,935
Especially in the Butte late abusive ways that are so reductive in like blaming people

892
00:52:56,191 --> 00:52:57,471
Experience

893
00:52:57,727 --> 00:52:58,239
Homelessness

894
00:53:01,311 --> 00:53:02,079
There've been a lot of

895
00:53:02,335 --> 00:53:02,847
Studies that have

896
00:53:03,103 --> 00:53:03,615
Roundabout

897
00:53:04,127 --> 00:53:04,895
Systemically

898
00:53:05,663 --> 00:53:06,687
That a lot of people

899
00:53:06,943 --> 00:53:07,711
The situation Theory

900
00:53:08,223 --> 00:53:11,039
Absolutely disgraceful and awful

901
00:53:11,295 --> 00:53:12,575
To have people

902
00:53:15,391 --> 00:53:16,415
I take

903
00:53:16,671 --> 00:53:17,439
But take such a Target

904
00:53:17,695 --> 00:53:19,231
Vulnerable population

905
00:53:19,743 --> 00:53:21,023
And I think that's why they do it

906
00:53:21,535 --> 00:53:22,559
And Owen does

907
00:53:23,327 --> 00:53:24,095
Cool bro Ali

908
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:25,631
F******

909
00:53:26,143 --> 00:53:27,679
How do you not look at that and go

910
00:53:28,191 --> 00:53:29,471
This is clearly a

911
00:53:29,727 --> 00:53:30,495
Structural

912
00:53:30,751 --> 00:53:31,263
Structural

913
00:53:38,943 --> 00:53:40,479
F*** off

914
00:53:40,735 --> 00:53:42,783
Defense

915
00:53:44,319 --> 00:53:46,367
Is also coming from place

916
00:53:47,391 --> 00:53:48,415
The homeless have wronged

917
00:53:50,719 --> 00:53:52,767
I believe this story that he tells

918
00:53:53,023 --> 00:53:54,303
To be not true

919
00:53:54,559 --> 00:53:56,095
I don't know that it's true

920
00:53:56,351 --> 00:53:58,911
Something racist to a homeless person in the forest

921
00:53:59,423 --> 00:54:02,751
It would be literally impossible for me to get to the bottom of this

922
00:54:03,007 --> 00:54:05,311
But I've never written bring this up before

923
00:54:05,567 --> 00:54:06,591
And it doesn't sound

924
00:54:09,919 --> 00:54:15,039
Manteca came home late

925
00:54:18,111 --> 00:54:18,879
$10 bill

926
00:54:24,511 --> 00:54:29,119
Telluride

927
00:54:30,655 --> 00:54:31,167
Cousin

928
00:54:31,423 --> 00:54:35,007
I don't know about this story

929
00:54:38,335 --> 00:54:44,479
It would actually be a national news story

930
00:54:47,039 --> 00:54:53,183
National news

931
00:54:53,439 --> 00:54:56,767
Thousand-dollar a year software developer in Seattle

932
00:54:57,279 --> 00:55:00,351
Yeah absolutely it would leave

933
00:55:00,607 --> 00:55:02,655
I can't find anything about it

934
00:55:03,679 --> 00:55:04,447
Google various

935
00:55:04,703 --> 00:55:05,215
Terms

936
00:55:06,495 --> 00:55:08,543
I don't know I can't I can't figure this out

937
00:55:10,591 --> 00:55:16,735
Literal zombie story with litter of course it would be national news every every meeting organization be like

938
00:55:19,551 --> 00:55:20,575
Like that

939
00:55:20,831 --> 00:55:22,367
A couple years later

940
00:55:22,879 --> 00:55:24,671
Personal greed

941
00:55:25,695 --> 00:55:27,487
Think it's not true but he is very creative

942
00:55:27,743 --> 00:55:28,255
I'll give him that

943
00:55:29,535 --> 00:55:32,095
He's big thing that he's pushing for towards the end of the sepa

944
00:55:32,351 --> 00:55:33,119
Episode is

945
00:55:33,631 --> 00:55:34,143
Look

946
00:55:34,399 --> 00:55:39,775
Do you know the globalist downtown

947
00:55:40,031 --> 00:55:41,823
So why don't we

948
00:55:42,079 --> 00:55:43,615
To the city council members house

949
00:55:44,895 --> 00:55:47,455
Now this is all good and well to sort of joke about

950
00:55:47,711 --> 00:55:50,015
But what Alex described

951
00:55:50,271 --> 00:55:51,295
A targeted harassed

952
00:55:51,551 --> 00:55:57,695
My campaign right now

953
00:55:59,487 --> 00:56:00,767
Conceptualizes this

954
00:56:01,279 --> 00:56:02,303
And the fact

955
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:08,703
If he will say I'm going to pay homeless people to go to their houses in trouble

956
00:56:08,959 --> 00:56:09,727
Pursues this playing

957
00:56:33,791 --> 00:56:36,351
It's really disgusting the Earth

958
00:56:37,119 --> 00:56:43,263
But it's also like that is legally if

959
00:56:49,663 --> 00:56:50,175
I think

960
00:56:50,431 --> 00:56:51,711
I think that might be illegal

961
00:56:52,223 --> 00:56:54,527
Ideas

962
00:56:54,783 --> 00:57:00,927
About to

963
00:57:01,183 --> 00:57:05,791
Members car

964
00:57:08,351 --> 00:57:09,887
No wonder you get pepper.

965
00:57:10,143 --> 00:57:16,287
Down there because he's going to be like

966
00:57:16,543 --> 00:57:21,407
Guessing help

967
00:57:26,271 --> 00:57:32,415
Infowars

968
00:57:32,927 --> 00:57:34,719
Really willing to be

969
00:57:34,975 --> 00:57:38,047
We talked into it

970
00:57:41,375 --> 00:57:42,655
Especially like paying

971
00:57:43,167 --> 00:57:45,471
People to go harass folks

972
00:57:47,007 --> 00:57:48,031
Shadier territory

973
00:57:48,287 --> 00:57:51,103
I've never said this before because generally speaking

974
00:57:51,359 --> 00:57:52,127
It's the worst thing that could

975
00:57:53,151 --> 00:57:54,943
B Owen Shroyer definitely

976
00:57:55,199 --> 00:57:55,711
Should have made a joke

977
00:57:56,991 --> 00:57:58,271
Generally speaking when he jokes

978
00:57:58,783 --> 00:58:00,319
It's the worst thing I've ever heard in my

979
00:58:00,575 --> 00:58:02,623
My entire life to deflect this a little

980
00:58:02,879 --> 00:58:06,975
So I skipped Sunday cuz I've noticed that episodes are a real

981
00:58:07,231 --> 00:58:08,767
My time lately he's not even

982
00:58:11,071 --> 00:58:11,583
It's just like

983
00:58:12,095 --> 00:58:18,239
It's not even worth it even when he shows up he's barely there you know almost no one's listening to a show on

984
00:58:18,495 --> 00:58:20,287
Sunday

985
00:58:20,543 --> 00:58:21,311
Fighting lower service

986
00:58:22,591 --> 00:58:23,103
Exactly

987
00:58:25,407 --> 00:58:28,735
And by this point the news has broken that there was a

988
00:58:28,991 --> 00:58:32,831
Potential meeting between Trump and Taliban leaders

989
00:58:33,087 --> 00:58:36,159
Cancel the about that

990
00:58:36,415 --> 00:58:42,559
Alex does not care about that meeting at all

991
00:58:42,815 --> 00:58:43,583
The president end

992
00:58:43,839 --> 00:58:45,375
Taliban leaders

993
00:58:45,631 --> 00:58:47,679
I don't know

994
00:58:49,471 --> 00:58:51,263
Should be you know I don't

995
00:58:52,287 --> 00:58:55,615
I expected him to have a position

996
00:58:56,127 --> 00:58:58,943
Because I think it's overwhelmed by the fact that John Bolton

997
00:58:59,967 --> 00:59:01,247
So Alex

998
00:59:01,503 --> 00:59:02,527
That is boring

999
00:59:02,783 --> 00:59:03,295
To that

1000
00:59:04,575 --> 00:59:06,623
Search on this whole

1001
00:59:10,719 --> 00:59:14,303
The Taliban invited to camp

1002
00:59:18,911 --> 00:59:20,447
Where is this

1003
00:59:25,311 --> 00:59:26,079
Just why

1004
00:59:32,479 --> 00:59:37,855
Serious issues president

1005
00:59:38,623 --> 00:59:42,207
The president

1006
00:59:44,767 --> 00:59:45,791
I'd like to take you back

1007
00:59:46,047 --> 00:59:52,191
Do the day that John Bolton was named National Security

1008
00:59:52,447 --> 00:59:54,239
Point

1009
00:59:55,007 --> 00:59:56,799
We got Rodger Stone popping in

1010
00:59:58,335 --> 00:59:58,847
Take

1011
00:59:59,103 --> 01:00:02,943
On Donald Trump's New National Security advisor

1012
01:00:03,455 --> 01:00:03,967
Mister

1013
01:00:07,551 --> 01:00:09,599
A lot of people really don't like

1014
01:00:09,855 --> 01:00:11,391
Including myself

1015
01:00:11,903 --> 01:00:15,231
Because he still pushes the failed Iraq war and other things like that

1016
01:00:16,255 --> 01:00:18,047
The word is on Bolton

1017
01:00:18,815 --> 01:00:21,887
Connections

1018
01:00:22,911 --> 01:00:25,727
Interstate Department in the UN in the Pentagon

1019
01:00:26,239 --> 01:00:29,055
And that he will be

1020
01:00:30,335 --> 01:00:30,847
Cool

1021
01:00:31,359 --> 01:00:33,663
Munchkin

1022
01:00:35,199 --> 01:00:36,479
His words

1023
01:00:37,759 --> 01:00:39,807
Policies that the president wants carried out

1024
01:00:40,063 --> 01:00:45,439
Whoops

1025
01:00:46,463 --> 01:00:50,303
That's specifically the opposite of now

1026
01:00:50,815 --> 01:00:56,959
Episode

1027
01:00:57,215 --> 01:00:59,519
Absolutely

1028
01:01:00,031 --> 01:01:01,567
A hundred percent

1029
01:01:02,591 --> 01:01:04,383
Rodger Stones friends with

1030
01:01:05,151 --> 01:01:07,967
National Security advisor

1031
01:01:08,479 --> 01:01:10,015
Whiskey

1032
01:01:10,527 --> 01:01:11,039
30 years

1033
01:01:15,391 --> 01:01:17,695
He said Bolton isn't

1034
01:01:20,767 --> 01:01:24,863
Trump supporters will not leak

1035
01:01:33,311 --> 01:01:34,335
Beach

1036
01:01:37,919 --> 01:01:41,759
In the present day by John Bolton

1037
01:01:42,015 --> 01:01:42,783
Will trump brought him in today

1038
01:01:43,039 --> 01:01:49,183
Ministration

1039
01:01:49,439 --> 01:01:51,743
Allocate brought up and denied

1040
01:01:56,095 --> 01:01:57,887
He's like he's going to work for

1041
01:02:00,191 --> 01:02:04,543
Useful to leave an idiot is going to be

1042
01:02:05,311 --> 01:02:06,335
Exactly

1043
01:02:07,871 --> 01:02:09,663
Rodger Stone tricked Alex

1044
01:02:09,919 --> 01:02:12,223
Anza Alexander tricked his audience

1045
01:02:12,479 --> 01:02:13,759
Go to being okay with it now Alex

1046
01:02:14,015 --> 01:02:14,783
Who sang the opposite

1047
01:02:15,295 --> 01:02:18,367
Yeah is that you know the other really naive gullible audience

1048
01:02:18,623 --> 01:02:20,671
Rodger Stone exploited them through Alex

1049
01:02:21,439 --> 01:02:26,815
What's great about this narrative life is that now Alex gets to pretend to John Bolton for all sorts of things

1050
01:02:27,071 --> 01:02:27,583
The trumps done

1051
01:02:28,863 --> 01:02:32,959
Not really working out North Korea

1052
01:02:33,215 --> 01:02:33,727
Because Bolt

1053
01:02:34,239 --> 01:02:35,007
Frottage

1054
01:02:35,775 --> 01:02:37,055
It's a very boring game this

1055
01:02:37,311 --> 01:02:38,591
Become very routine at this point

1056
01:02:38,847 --> 01:02:39,359
Whatever Trump

1057
01:02:39,615 --> 01:02:40,639
Cast someone out

1058
01:02:40,895 --> 01:02:41,407
Other White House

1059
01:02:41,663 --> 01:02:43,455
Becomes like what was the problem

1060
01:02:44,223 --> 01:02:50,367
And so we get to see that all over again Alex gets to pretend

1061
01:02:51,135 --> 01:02:51,903
Interpretation of things

1062
01:02:52,415 --> 01:02:55,743
Negative things about

1063
01:02:55,999 --> 01:02:56,767
But he also

1064
01:02:57,023 --> 01:03:00,095
Overcame those bad things because of Rodger

1065
01:03:00,607 --> 01:03:05,215
So now he gets to pretend

1066
01:03:05,727 --> 01:03:06,751
Try and make it okay

1067
01:03:07,007 --> 01:03:08,031
The bullnose be nominated

1068
01:03:08,543 --> 01:03:09,311
70s cake

1069
01:03:11,615 --> 01:03:14,431
We learn next Trump has a temper

1070
01:03:15,455 --> 01:03:17,247
Which is not something that I want to talk about all that

1071
01:03:17,503 --> 01:03:18,271
That much

1072
01:03:24,927 --> 01:03:25,951
Trump is screaming

1073
01:03:29,535 --> 01:03:31,327
Vegetable

1074
01:03:32,351 --> 01:03:32,863
Aw

1075
01:03:35,167 --> 01:03:36,447
Composing

1076
01:03:40,543 --> 01:03:41,823
Mr. volcano

1077
01:03:42,079 --> 01:03:43,103
Peter super-slick

1078
01:03:43,359 --> 01:03:43,871
Nice

1079
01:03:45,151 --> 01:03:49,247
It is you can or he starts screaming people and telling them

1080
01:03:49,759 --> 01:03:50,527
Confident

1081
01:03:51,039 --> 01:03:52,063
That's what

1082
01:03:53,855 --> 01:03:55,647
Alpha male characteristics

1083
01:03:55,903 --> 01:03:57,439
Odyssey Fun

1084
01:03:57,951 --> 01:03:59,999
Really is trying

1085
01:04:00,511 --> 01:04:05,631
That's exactly the way you described like Hillary Clinton surprise eggs

1086
01:04:06,399 --> 01:04:09,215
If I don't understand

1087
01:04:09,471 --> 01:04:10,751
To me but he can go and like

1088
01:04:12,031 --> 01:04:12,799
3 years

1089
01:04:13,055 --> 01:04:19,199
He's been screaming about Hillary Clinton yells at people behind the scene

1090
01:04:24,831 --> 01:04:26,879
Like it's crazy I mean

1091
01:04:27,647 --> 01:04:28,671
Trump

1092
01:04:29,695 --> 01:04:30,207
A man

1093
01:04:31,999 --> 01:04:32,511
And Hillary

1094
01:04:33,023 --> 01:04:33,535
Is not

1095
01:04:36,351 --> 01:04:42,495
Christian Supremacy

1096
01:04:43,775 --> 01:04:44,799
If Alex knows that

1097
01:04:45,311 --> 01:04:46,335
Seems like you really believe

1098
01:04:46,591 --> 01:04:47,615
Is that story that

1099
01:04:50,431 --> 01:04:51,199
In her Memoir to

1100
01:04:51,455 --> 01:04:54,271
Maybe

1101
01:04:54,527 --> 01:04:55,807
It sure sounds like it fits with his

1102
01:04:56,063 --> 01:05:01,695
Very smooth are you screaming at you

1103
01:05:01,951 --> 01:05:03,231
To be around

1104
01:05:04,511 --> 01:05:06,047
Terrible person enter f****** rapist

1105
01:05:07,071 --> 01:05:08,351
So in the next clip

1106
01:05:08,607 --> 01:05:10,399
Alex talks about

1107
01:05:10,655 --> 01:05:13,471
The

1108
01:05:14,495 --> 01:05:15,519
Queen story time

1109
01:05:16,031 --> 01:05:16,543
Issues

1110
01:05:16,799 --> 01:05:17,311
Yeah

1111
01:05:19,615 --> 01:05:20,639
Something a little bit

1112
01:05:20,895 --> 01:05:22,431
Worth pointing out

1113
01:05:24,223 --> 01:05:25,247
Who talked about it

1114
01:05:25,503 --> 01:05:26,271
He's covered it a bunch

1115
01:05:27,295 --> 01:05:28,319
But I do think there's a

1116
01:05:28,575 --> 01:05:29,599
Slightly excited

1117
01:05:30,111 --> 01:05:30,623
It's important

1118
01:05:33,439 --> 01:05:34,975
The Wichita Kansas eagle

1119
01:05:47,519 --> 01:05:48,287
Is the question

1120
01:05:59,295 --> 01:06:01,855
Running the Houston when we're both convicted child

1121
01:06:03,391 --> 01:06:05,695
One register

1122
01:06:06,207 --> 01:06:06,719
So

1123
01:06:07,231 --> 01:06:07,999
Look here's the

1124
01:06:09,023 --> 01:06:15,167
The story that Alex is talking about is naturally being presented Wichita

1125
01:06:15,935 --> 01:06:16,959
Honestly

1126
01:06:17,215 --> 01:06:20,799
I think what he's doing kind of is close to Southern could be legally action

1127
01:06:22,591 --> 01:06:27,455
Story involves a possibility of specifically running background checks

1128
01:06:27,711 --> 01:06:28,223
After sex offense

1129
01:06:28,479 --> 01:06:30,271
Only on participants in the

1130
01:06:30,527 --> 01:06:31,039
Queen Story Hour

1131
01:06:31,551 --> 01:06:34,879
Now this obviously is an issue for a number free

1132
01:06:35,647 --> 01:06:36,671
The first is that any

1133
01:06:36,927 --> 01:06:39,487
Real background check that would be doing would turn up sex with

1134
01:06:39,999 --> 01:06:42,815
So this is kind of redundant targeted framing of the issue

1135
01:06:43,583 --> 01:06:44,607
By publicizing.

1136
01:06:44,863 --> 01:06:46,655
Specifically running background checks for sex offenders

1137
01:06:47,679 --> 01:06:48,447
Sentence for participants

1138
01:06:48,703 --> 01:06:51,519
The outcome is the people couple the idea of drag queens

1139
01:06:51,775 --> 01:06:55,359
The lgbtq community has beat related to sex

1140
01:06:55,615 --> 01:07:00,479
We have to investigate specifically

1141
01:07:01,247 --> 01:07:03,551
Stripes

1142
01:07:03,807 --> 01:07:04,319
Quickly

1143
01:07:05,087 --> 01:07:06,623
Geared towards committing

1144
01:07:07,391 --> 01:07:08,415
Is she Brave

1145
01:07:08,927 --> 01:07:15,071
It's my understanding from looking into there's a bunch that's Alex won't stop talking about it that most Library systems do routine back

1146
01:07:17,631 --> 01:07:22,495
And probably inappropriate things to do regardless of who the person is running the event

1147
01:07:23,007 --> 01:07:28,639
Absolute the drag queen Story Hour or a second amendment reading shooting at as long as

1148
01:07:28,895 --> 01:07:29,919
Selectively enforced

1149
01:07:30,175 --> 01:07:31,967
And used as a means of marginalization

1150
01:07:32,223 --> 01:07:33,759
It feels like it's the library's right

1151
01:07:35,295 --> 01:07:38,111
It doesn't feel like that is what the policy is about

1152
01:07:38,879 --> 01:07:39,391
However

1153
01:07:39,903 --> 01:07:42,463
This does feel like it's selective and then to target the LG

1154
01:07:43,231 --> 01:07:47,327
Community as evidenced by released Library minutes from a meeting

1155
01:07:47,583 --> 01:07:51,679
Reflecting that this proposal was brought to the table by a note Adele anti-lgbt

1156
01:07:51,935 --> 01:07:52,447
Thank you Pastor.

1157
01:07:52,703 --> 01:07:53,215
Creek Coffee

1158
01:07:53,983 --> 01:07:58,591
He seems to be interested in the targeting and marginalization side of this possible policy

1159
01:07:59,103 --> 01:07:59,871
Explode from Craig

1160
01:08:01,407 --> 01:08:02,687
I would like to

1161
01:08:02,943 --> 01:08:04,479
Target and marginalized

1162
01:08:04,735 --> 01:08:05,503
These certain types

1163
01:08:06,271 --> 01:08:07,039
How do we go

1164
01:08:07,807 --> 01:08:08,575
From the minutes

1165
01:08:08,831 --> 01:08:11,135
Quote your actions constitute child abuse

1166
01:08:11,391 --> 01:08:13,439
Drag queens are part of the adult entertainment

1167
01:08:13,951 --> 01:08:17,279
Children are much too young to be exposed to the lgbtq agenda

1168
01:08:17,535 --> 01:08:20,095
And their brand of immoral and unhealthy sexual

1169
01:08:20,863 --> 01:08:22,143
Children model with AC

1170
01:08:22,399 --> 01:08:28,031
Can hear perverse activities such as this used to be found only in back alleys deep or houses in dark closet

1171
01:08:28,799 --> 01:08:32,895
To the public in daylight

1172
01:08:33,663 --> 01:08:34,687
He goes on to say quote

1173
01:08:34,943 --> 01:08:36,735
What are the stated goals of the lgbtq

1174
01:08:36,991 --> 01:08:42,623
Teq agenda is to browbeat and indoctrinate the public while gaining access to our children through government schools the main

1175
01:08:42,879 --> 01:08:44,927
Mainstream media public libraries politics

1176
01:08:45,183 --> 01:08:46,207
And public policy

1177
01:08:46,463 --> 01:08:48,767
And any other means to promote their perversity

1178
01:08:49,279 --> 01:08:53,887
It is irresponsible behavior is like this to contribute to the hate and division we now see in the nation

1179
01:08:54,143 --> 01:08:55,935
We are indeed in a culture War

1180
01:08:56,191 --> 01:08:56,959
I was make

1181
01:08:58,239 --> 01:09:00,543
But it turns out that I should have gone

1182
01:09:00,799 --> 01:09:01,311
A lot further

1183
01:09:01,567 --> 01:09:05,151
This is not a man who's concerned with whether or not the drag queens

1184
01:09:05,407 --> 01:09:06,687
Stories are sex offenders are not

1185
01:09:06,943 --> 01:09:08,223
He wants them to be gone from

1186
01:09:08,479 --> 01:09:12,319
Society or at least dark closets

1187
01:09:12,831 --> 01:09:13,855
Either gets there exist

1188
01:09:14,367 --> 01:09:16,927
Particularly in public and their inclusion in a large

1189
01:09:17,183 --> 01:09:20,511
Society monster created

1190
01:09:21,023 --> 01:09:23,839
That's the motivation behind a campaign like the one he's engaged

1191
01:09:24,351 --> 01:09:29,471
Bunch of s*** about sex offender background check

1192
01:09:29,727 --> 01:09:30,495
You succeeded

1193
01:09:30,751 --> 01:09:33,311
Associated the story our participants as being sexy

1194
01:09:34,079 --> 01:09:37,151
This is really shady s*** particularly when the motivation

1195
01:09:37,407 --> 01:09:39,455
It's so clearly just to make members of the LGB

1196
01:09:39,967 --> 01:09:42,015
EQ Community not feel welcome

1197
01:09:42,271 --> 01:09:43,807
And be as a part of society

1198
01:09:44,831 --> 01:09:47,391
Coffee runs a church called the Refiner's Family Church

1199
01:09:47,647 --> 01:09:48,159
Derby can

1200
01:09:48,671 --> 01:09:50,207
Which is 12 miles outside of Witcher

1201
01:09:51,231 --> 01:09:57,375
Yeah

1202
01:09:57,631 --> 01:10:02,495
The town of over 22,000 people and has a library large enough that it

1203
01:10:02,751 --> 01:10:03,519
Mentioned it

1204
01:10:03,775 --> 01:10:09,919
Today's Wikipedia page about the time he likes that Wichita Library

1205
01:10:10,175 --> 01:10:12,223
Freezer is making what a library and a sidhe Dozen

1206
01:10:12,479 --> 01:10:13,247
Live in his business

1207
01:10:13,759 --> 01:10:19,903
Culture War to drive 12 miles

1208
01:10:20,159 --> 01:10:21,183
I don't visit

1209
01:10:21,695 --> 01:10:23,231
His church doesn't have its own building

1210
01:10:23,487 --> 01:10:28,607
They made the room they rent in the derby golf and country club which I will say from everything I can find

1211
01:10:29,631 --> 01:10:33,215
Polarizing golf club is

1212
01:10:33,471 --> 01:10:36,543
Even more literally money changers in the f******

1213
01:10:39,103 --> 01:10:40,639
There's a church find

1214
01:10:44,991 --> 01:10:47,551
They are

1215
01:10:47,807 --> 01:10:50,623
Another one

1216
01:10:51,391 --> 01:10:52,671
It strikes me as

1217
01:10:53,183 --> 01:10:56,767
Coffee guy talks about Allah

1218
01:10:57,535 --> 01:11:02,399
You know what you got is this guy who has a clear anti-lgbt

1219
01:11:02,911 --> 01:11:03,423
Did you stamp

1220
01:11:03,679 --> 01:11:04,959
Against

1221
01:11:07,263 --> 01:11:08,543
Put Sports this motion

1222
01:11:08,799 --> 01:11:10,335
In the library

1223
01:11:11,103 --> 01:11:15,711
From there the right-wing is more than capable to take the ball and run with it

1224
01:11:16,479 --> 01:11:17,503
If you read or coffee it's

1225
01:11:17,759 --> 01:11:23,647
Suggested to the library board agenda

1226
01:11:23,903 --> 01:11:26,463
Yep so it makes sense if you're on that board

1227
01:11:26,719 --> 01:11:28,767
Not want to go along with everything you say

1228
01:11:29,535 --> 01:11:32,351
It's a board is at all resistant to his message in his demand

1229
01:11:33,119 --> 01:11:37,471
It's so easy for the blogs and s******* websites to frame the situation is something like quote

1230
01:11:37,727 --> 01:11:40,287
Kansas library board divided on whether to let sex

1231
01:11:40,543 --> 01:11:41,311
Offenders presented

1232
01:11:41,567 --> 01:11:42,079
The children

1233
01:11:42,335 --> 01:11:47,967
Which way does a real hippo from lifesitenews

1234
01:11:48,223 --> 01:11:49,503
F*** yourself right

1235
01:11:49,759 --> 01:11:55,391
Goddamnit ultimately the reality is it this week Bible reading or second book shooting at

1236
01:11:55,647 --> 01:12:01,023
None of these people would even suspect or be concerned about the possibility that one of the presenters by be a sex offender

1237
01:12:01,535 --> 01:12:05,631
Their only concern because of their pre-existing bigotry towards the lgbtq community

1238
01:12:06,399 --> 01:12:08,959
Perhaps the ultimate irony is that all of these

1239
01:12:09,215 --> 01:12:11,263
People

1240
01:12:11,519 --> 01:12:14,079
Run background checks on people which

1241
01:12:14,335 --> 01:12:17,919
I've heard call trt1

1242
01:12:18,175 --> 01:12:18,943
These people so much

1243
01:12:19,199 --> 01:12:19,711
Because this is the

1244
01:12:19,967 --> 01:12:21,247
The same group of people who were like

1245
01:12:21,759 --> 01:12:23,807
Christian

1246
01:12:24,063 --> 01:12:26,623
Specifically targeted and harassed

1247
01:12:29,695 --> 01:12:34,559
Kill us all at the same time I would like everybody here this minority

1248
01:12:34,815 --> 01:12:37,631
And treat them like the awful people that they are

1249
01:12:37,887 --> 01:12:38,911
And so on and so forth

1250
01:12:39,423 --> 01:12:39,935
F*** you

1251
01:12:41,727 --> 01:12:43,519
Don't even don't even talk just great

1252
01:12:45,311 --> 01:12:46,335
You don't mean any

1253
01:12:49,407 --> 01:12:50,175
Confusing and knock

1254
01:12:51,199 --> 01:12:55,551
Yeah so we've got over this but the case in Houston that everyone relies on

1255
01:12:55,807 --> 01:12:57,599
To be like a sex offender

1256
01:13:02,719 --> 01:13:07,327
Here's a situation where background checks are already required for all people who hold events at the library

1257
01:13:07,583 --> 01:13:09,631
But the library didn't follow their own procedures

1258
01:13:10,655 --> 01:13:15,263
The only real angle of outrage that you should have is be upset that the library didn't do their job

1259
01:13:15,775 --> 01:13:17,311
And in this case again the publicity

1260
01:13:17,567 --> 01:13:21,919
Cities surrounding the event was not led by people who are concerned with whether or not these people are sex offender

1261
01:13:22,431 --> 01:13:24,223
He was led by a group called massresistance

1262
01:13:25,247 --> 01:13:26,783
Aggressively anti-lgbt

1263
01:13:27,039 --> 01:13:27,807
Group as a whole

1264
01:13:28,063 --> 01:13:30,879
And their goal wasn't to make sure that the library is a safe place

1265
01:13:31,135 --> 01:13:32,671
For children it's to marginalize

1266
01:13:32,927 --> 01:13:33,439
Community

1267
01:13:34,463 --> 01:13:37,535
The fact that these events have been going on all over the country for a while now

1268
01:13:37,791 --> 01:13:41,631
This Houston situation is really the only one these people ever

1269
01:13:41,887 --> 01:13:45,727
Application for the contestant there tons of pedophiles in a drag queen story hours

1270
01:13:45,983 --> 01:13:47,519
It is

1271
01:13:48,799 --> 01:13:51,103
Believe that they're wrong

1272
01:13:52,639 --> 01:13:54,687
You have aggressively interested parties

1273
01:13:54,943 --> 01:13:55,455
Black Mass resist

1274
01:13:55,967 --> 01:13:58,015
The tons of anti-lgbtq organization

1275
01:13:58,271 --> 01:13:59,807
Pouring over criminal databases

1276
01:14:00,063 --> 01:14:01,343
And sending out for your request

1277
01:14:01,855 --> 01:14:03,903
So you definitely way more stories

1278
01:14:04,159 --> 01:14:04,671
I found

1279
01:14:05,695 --> 01:14:06,719
The issue for Alex

1280
01:14:10,047 --> 01:14:10,559
Legal aid

1281
01:14:11,071 --> 01:14:11,839
Is he speaking into

1282
01:14:12,095 --> 01:14:13,631
Specifics that don't really match reality

1283
01:14:14,143 --> 01:14:17,215
He said that the two offenders in Houston where leaders of that

1284
01:14:17,727 --> 01:14:21,823
Because he wants to create the perception that they were running the show is it means of grooming children

1285
01:14:22,079 --> 01:14:28,223
Neither was a leader of the honestly I think that this could easily be construed as defamation of the action

1286
01:14:28,735 --> 01:14:29,247
Leaders of the group

1287
01:14:30,271 --> 01:14:34,623
The leaders and organizers of the Houston chapter art

1288
01:14:34,879 --> 01:14:35,391
And Devin will

1289
01:14:35,647 --> 01:14:36,927
And neither of them are sex offender

1290
01:14:37,695 --> 01:14:41,023
And in fact they've discussed the revelations of people who'd volunteer for their event

1291
01:14:41,279 --> 01:14:42,559
Hey concealed their past Act

1292
01:14:42,815 --> 01:14:43,327
Atkins from

1293
01:14:43,583 --> 01:14:44,095
Candidly

1294
01:14:44,607 --> 01:14:45,375
It was devastating

1295
01:14:45,631 --> 01:14:48,191
For them know about these conviction

1296
01:14:48,703 --> 01:14:50,495
And they followed the library policies

1297
01:14:50,751 --> 01:14:51,775
And the library where the 12

1298
01:14:52,031 --> 01:14:54,079
Who failed up the old they're at their end of the bargain

1299
01:14:55,103 --> 01:15:01,247
One important point is it when the story is covered right-wing sites don't just use pictures of the

1300
01:15:02,527 --> 01:15:03,295
Who were sex

1301
01:15:03,807 --> 01:15:04,831
Course not they used

1302
01:15:05,343 --> 01:15:08,415
There ever was well not necessarily

1303
01:15:08,671 --> 01:15:09,183
They don't breathe

1304
01:15:09,439 --> 01:15:10,719
But the point is they don't really

1305
01:15:10,975 --> 01:15:12,255
Care whether or not they're using the pic

1306
01:15:12,511 --> 01:15:13,279
Picture of the right person

1307
01:15:13,535 --> 01:15:14,559
And this is called

1308
01:15:16,095 --> 01:15:17,631
From an article in the houstonian mag

1309
01:15:17,887 --> 01:15:20,447
Asean by one of the Houston chapters Founders quotes

1310
01:15:20,703 --> 01:15:23,263
The most upsetting outcome is the hate BlackBerry

1311
01:15:23,519 --> 01:15:24,287
That's one of the drag

1312
01:15:24,799 --> 01:15:25,567
Because of

1313
01:15:25,823 --> 01:15:26,335
The controversy

1314
01:15:27,103 --> 01:15:29,663
She's become a canvas onto which these right-wing pundit

1315
01:15:29,919 --> 01:15:31,199
Projector hatred and fear

1316
01:15:31,711 --> 01:15:33,503
African-American with a beard

1317
01:15:33,759 --> 01:15:34,783
Facebook makeup

1318
01:15:35,295 --> 01:15:38,367
Breitbart.com Miss identified her as the direct

1319
01:15:38,623 --> 01:15:40,415
Sex offender in question

1320
01:15:40,671 --> 01:15:41,183
It isn't her

1321
01:15:41,439 --> 01:15:44,767
Her fault she has a clean record and is one of those prolific drag performers

1322
01:15:45,023 --> 01:15:46,815
In the city she's done nothing wrong

1323
01:15:47,071 --> 01:15:50,655
How could she have known when we invited her to read a story to a handful of children

1324
01:15:50,911 --> 01:15:53,983
National score

1325
01:15:54,239 --> 01:15:55,007
How could any of us

1326
01:15:56,287 --> 01:15:57,311
These are delicate issues

1327
01:15:57,567 --> 01:16:01,663
Being intentionally packaged as anti-lgbtq propaganda by people like out

1328
01:16:02,431 --> 01:16:03,199
It's disgraceful

1329
01:16:03,455 --> 01:16:05,759
Is bigoted and probably worst of all

1330
01:16:06,015 --> 01:16:06,783
It doesn't do

1331
01:16:07,039 --> 01:16:09,343
Anything to solve the issues that they're pretending to be

1332
01:16:09,599 --> 01:16:10,111
We concerned about

1333
01:16:10,879 --> 01:16:12,671
They don't care about appropriate background check

1334
01:16:12,927 --> 01:16:14,463
Even if every drag queen or King

1335
01:16:14,719 --> 01:16:15,743
Was thoroughly vetted

1336
01:16:15,999 --> 01:16:19,327
Perfectly they find some other Association and accusation to Labadee

1337
01:16:19,839 --> 01:16:21,119
Because it's not about background check

1338
01:16:21,887 --> 01:16:25,471
It's about their unwillingness to accept certain types of people being allowed to exist

1339
01:16:25,983 --> 01:16:26,495
Society

1340
01:16:27,007 --> 01:16:29,055
Give everyone background check

1341
01:16:29,567 --> 01:16:31,359
As long as it's universally applied

1342
01:16:31,615 --> 01:16:32,383
I don't see a problem

1343
01:16:34,687 --> 01:16:39,807
Absolutely absolutely

1344
01:16:40,319 --> 01:16:45,183
But also let's not forget to be very clear that people like Alex and all these people

1345
01:16:45,439 --> 01:16:47,231
Should go straight up f*** themselves

1346
01:16:47,487 --> 01:16:49,279
Further duplicitous actions

1347
01:16:50,815 --> 01:16:51,583
Care what you have to say

1348
01:16:52,351 --> 01:16:53,119
Even if it's

1349
01:16:53,375 --> 01:16:54,143
Applicable

1350
01:16:54,399 --> 01:16:55,423
If you're making a bad

1351
01:16:56,191 --> 01:16:57,215
Right I don't f***

1352
01:16:57,727 --> 01:16:59,263
And this is not entirely

1353
01:16:59,519 --> 01:17:00,287
Absolute

1354
01:17:00,543 --> 01:17:02,079
It's it's

1355
01:17:02,847 --> 01:17:03,871
It's crazy

1356
01:17:04,127 --> 01:17:05,663
The minutes for that are

1357
01:17:05,919 --> 01:17:06,431
So reveal

1358
01:17:07,199 --> 01:17:07,967
So revealing

1359
01:17:08,223 --> 01:17:10,015
Because here's here's what you say

1360
01:17:10,527 --> 01:17:11,295
If your

1361
01:17:11,551 --> 01:17:12,575
If you're doing this just say

1362
01:17:12,831 --> 01:17:14,111
I think we should have

1363
01:17:14,367 --> 01:17:15,135
Checks for people who

1364
01:17:15,391 --> 01:17:16,671
Read here

1365
01:17:16,927 --> 01:17:21,535
And then you get away there's no reason to rant about the lgbtq agenda

1366
01:17:21,791 --> 01:17:24,095
Is that strengthens your argument

1367
01:17:24,351 --> 01:17:24,863
Cuz it Doesn't

1368
01:17:25,119 --> 01:17:27,679
If you walked in there and said I think we should have

1369
01:17:28,191 --> 01:17:28,703
Text or everybody

1370
01:17:29,727 --> 01:17:30,495
I think that's a good idea

1371
01:17:30,751 --> 01:17:36,383
You still have to sort of understand that the only reason the conversation is even happening

1372
01:17:36,639 --> 01:17:37,407
Coming from this

1373
01:17:37,663 --> 01:17:40,223
Guy is because of his pre-existing

1374
01:17:40,479 --> 01:17:42,783
Feelings

1375
01:17:44,831 --> 01:17:49,439
Like I said most of the libraries that I've looked into that are related to any of these stories

1376
01:17:50,463 --> 01:17:51,487
Already have

1377
01:17:51,743 --> 01:17:53,791
This rule in place

1378
01:17:54,303 --> 01:17:55,327
If there isn't

1379
01:17:55,583 --> 01:17:56,863
The library that does

1380
01:17:57,119 --> 01:17:59,167
Absolutely fish be conversation

1381
01:17:59,423 --> 01:18:00,447
It should be

1382
01:18:00,703 --> 01:18:02,495
It's kind of gross that

1383
01:18:02,751 --> 01:18:04,543
The conversations being spurred by this

1384
01:18:05,311 --> 01:18:08,127
But I think it's probably a very small number

1385
01:18:08,383 --> 01:18:08,895
Library

1386
01:18:09,407 --> 01:18:10,687
But don't already have

1387
01:18:11,455 --> 01:18:14,015
Dishonest framing

1388
01:18:16,319 --> 01:18:16,831
Remove alarm

1389
01:18:17,087 --> 01:18:21,183
If it's next to a clip Alex

1390
01:18:21,951 --> 01:18:22,719
And you lied

1391
01:18:23,231 --> 01:18:23,743
Quite a bit

1392
01:18:26,815 --> 01:18:27,839
This critical

1393
01:18:28,863 --> 01:18:30,143
Report that I have

1394
01:18:32,703 --> 01:18:35,007
There's going to be a forced blood test

1395
01:18:37,823 --> 01:18:39,871
On certain people in America

1396
01:18:49,599 --> 01:18:51,391
Wall Street Journal

1397
01:18:51,903 --> 01:18:53,183
Getting in Plainview

1398
01:18:55,231 --> 01:18:57,791
Telling you what they're really saying article

1399
01:18:59,327 --> 01:19:03,935
That's hilarious

1400
01:19:04,447 --> 01:19:07,007
Meeting I can lie about whatever is in this article

1401
01:19:07,263 --> 01:19:08,543
Remember when I

1402
01:19:08,799 --> 01:19:14,943
Read you the article and it says the opposite of what I said.

1403
01:19:15,199 --> 01:19:15,967
Isaiah

1404
01:19:16,223 --> 01:19:18,015
I meant to say right

1405
01:19:18,271 --> 01:19:18,783
So

1406
01:19:19,295 --> 01:19:19,807
Think about a lot

1407
01:19:20,063 --> 01:19:21,599
My specialty is being

1408
01:19:21,855 --> 01:19:26,975
Particularly convincing nonsensical disconnected

1409
01:19:27,487 --> 01:19:29,023
So this is legitimately bulshit

1410
01:19:29,279 --> 01:19:32,863
What else is lying about is a new article discussing breakthroughs regarding post-traumatic

1411
01:19:34,399 --> 01:19:37,471
What are the difficulties with PTSD diagnosis of

1412
01:19:37,727 --> 01:19:38,239
Comes along

1413
01:19:38,495 --> 01:19:39,007
With the condition

1414
01:19:39,263 --> 01:19:41,311
Often patients are unwilling or resistant to

1415
01:19:41,567 --> 01:19:42,335
To disclose their symptoms

1416
01:19:42,591 --> 01:19:43,871
Fear being labeled crazy

1417
01:19:44,127 --> 01:19:44,895
Which really only makes

1418
01:19:45,151 --> 01:19:45,663
Things worse

1419
01:19:46,175 --> 01:19:51,039
A group of researchers set out to see if there were any indicators that they could find that would prove as an effective

1420
01:19:51,295 --> 01:19:53,343
Screen for physical markers are people suffering

1421
01:19:53,599 --> 01:19:54,367
BTS

1422
01:19:54,623 --> 01:19:58,719
Other findings were recently written up in the latest issue of molecular psychiatry

1423
01:19:59,743 --> 01:20:01,535
27 chemicals

1424
01:20:01,791 --> 01:20:04,351
Signatures which heart rate reading

1425
01:20:04,607 --> 01:20:06,911
We're bound to have an accuracy of 81%

1426
01:20:07,167 --> 01:20:08,191
Distinguishing weather person

1427
01:20:08,703 --> 01:20:10,239
Had a pre-existing diagnosis of

1428
01:20:10,495 --> 01:20:11,007
BTSD

1429
01:20:11,519 --> 01:20:15,616
They have a group

1430
01:20:17,408 --> 01:20:19,200
The diagnose PTSD

1431
01:20:19,456 --> 01:20:20,224
An asshat

1432
01:20:20,480 --> 01:20:23,808
Test an 81% accuracy

1433
01:20:24,064 --> 01:20:24,576
Distinguishing between

1434
01:20:25,856 --> 01:20:27,904
It's very interest

1435
01:20:28,160 --> 01:20:28,672
Variance

1436
01:20:29,184 --> 01:20:34,304
It's very clear however that the results aren't diagnostic

1437
01:20:34,560 --> 01:20:36,352
Someone for How likely they are to

1438
01:20:36,608 --> 01:20:37,120
PTSD

1439
01:20:37,376 --> 01:20:42,496
Which is to say that just testing positive with their set doesn't qualify as indicative of a diagnosis

1440
01:20:42,752 --> 01:20:43,264
Just a sign

1441
01:20:43,520 --> 01:20:44,032
Maybe something

1442
01:20:46,336 --> 01:20:47,360
They're pretty big limitation

1443
01:20:47,616 --> 01:20:50,944
Their study and they're clear about it like it's not a knock on the study at all it's just

1444
01:20:51,200 --> 01:20:52,224
Limitations of

1445
01:20:53,760 --> 01:20:57,600
To do

1446
01:20:57,856 --> 01:20:58,368
6 people

1447
01:20:58,624 --> 01:21:00,160
They were all male combat veteran

1448
01:21:00,416 --> 01:21:03,488
Chemical markers would be applicable to

1449
01:21:03,744 --> 01:21:04,768
People in other population

1450
01:21:05,280 --> 01:21:07,072
But that's something that merits further study

1451
01:21:07,840 --> 01:21:09,376
It'll need to be upon more studies

1452
01:21:09,632 --> 01:21:11,680
Before this will ever be used in a clinical

1453
01:21:11,936 --> 01:21:13,216
Exciting I really

1454
01:21:13,984 --> 01:21:14,496
Wants

1455
01:21:15,008 --> 01:21:15,520
The media

1456
01:21:20,896 --> 01:21:21,408
Unless

1457
01:21:22,688 --> 01:21:27,552
Do you know what I mean because this particular

1458
01:21:27,808 --> 01:21:28,832
Unless they have

1459
01:21:29,088 --> 01:21:32,672
We've proven that we can do

1460
01:21:32,928 --> 01:21:33,952
Tomorrow at every hop

1461
01:21:36,256 --> 01:21:38,304
But every other stories always

1462
01:21:42,912 --> 01:21:43,680
Bulshit up about

1463
01:21:44,192 --> 01:21:50,080
Mega potion

1464
01:21:50,336 --> 01:21:52,384
Or stories about this progress

1465
01:21:53,152 --> 01:21:55,456
Quite frankly they're covering it up

1466
01:21:55,968 --> 01:21:56,480
Nelly

1467
01:21:56,736 --> 01:21:57,248
So

1468
01:22:00,320 --> 01:22:01,088
Hear something like this

1469
01:22:01,600 --> 01:22:03,904
His first thought is Tessa going to

1470
01:22:04,160 --> 01:22:05,184
Used 9471

1471
01:22:05,440 --> 01:22:06,464
To take so they can get my gun

1472
01:22:08,256 --> 01:22:10,304
People who suffer from PTSD you're living in a certain

1473
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:11,072
Kind of hell

1474
01:22:11,328 --> 01:22:13,120
Anything that can be done to get them to treat

1475
01:22:13,376 --> 01:22:14,912
They need to be able to live again

1476
01:22:15,168 --> 01:22:16,192
There's something very positive

1477
01:22:16,704 --> 01:22:19,264
Subject

1478
01:22:20,288 --> 01:22:23,872
Awesome care about alleviating the suffering of people who

1479
01:22:24,128 --> 01:22:24,640
Something awful

1480
01:22:25,152 --> 01:22:25,920
He doesn't give a f***

1481
01:22:26,432 --> 01:22:28,480
Because his overarching paranoia doesn't allow him

1482
01:22:29,248 --> 01:22:30,272
Nose monstrous

1483
01:22:31,552 --> 01:22:32,576
Nothing

1484
01:22:33,088 --> 01:22:35,648
More to say about that other than

1485
01:22:37,184 --> 01:22:38,464
So

1486
01:22:38,720 --> 01:22:40,000
Gets into

1487
01:22:40,512 --> 01:22:41,536
The media lies about

1488
01:22:41,792 --> 01:22:42,816
ShopRite

1489
01:22:48,448 --> 01:22:49,984
Okay well that

1490
01:22:50,240 --> 01:22:54,080
Yeah

1491
01:23:00,480 --> 01:23:02,528
Resort course in Scotland

1492
01:23:03,296 --> 01:23:04,576
Forsyth Audible

1493
01:23:09,440 --> 01:23:12,512
Spit on it

1494
01:23:12,768 --> 01:23:14,048
Indeed

1495
01:23:35,296 --> 01:23:36,832
A little bit

1496
01:23:37,344 --> 01:23:39,904
It's only place conservative

1497
01:23:40,160 --> 01:23:41,952
I can definitely understand

1498
01:23:42,208 --> 01:23:44,256
Just like this story about Trump Scotland Hotel

1499
01:23:44,512 --> 01:23:45,792
The Trump Turnberry

1500
01:23:46,048 --> 01:23:46,560
Resort

1501
01:23:47,072 --> 01:23:50,144
If you do

1502
01:23:50,400 --> 01:23:50,912
He's become

1503
01:23:51,424 --> 01:23:53,216
The issue with Trump's hotel goes like this

1504
01:23:53,728 --> 01:23:57,824
There was a refueling stop that could be made at the Prestwick airport which no one is claiming

1505
01:23:58,080 --> 01:23:58,592
Trombone

1506
01:23:59,104 --> 01:24:05,248
However he does have a hotel nearby it is military government Personnel or more frequently stopping at that specific

1507
01:24:05,504 --> 01:24:06,784
Without her other good reason

1508
01:24:07,040 --> 01:24:08,064
It does tend to indicate

1509
01:24:08,320 --> 01:24:08,832
It's something corrupt

1510
01:24:10,624 --> 01:24:14,976
As the president

1511
01:24:15,232 --> 01:24:15,744
Free

1512
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:17,792
Room and board at his hotel

1513
01:24:18,048 --> 01:24:19,840
Not necessarily

1514
01:24:20,096 --> 01:24:23,936
In 2015 military stopped at this airport for refueling 95t

1515
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:28,032
So far this year they've stopped their 259 time

1516
01:24:28,288 --> 01:24:29,056
An increased doesn't

1517
01:24:29,312 --> 01:24:32,128
Seem to be related to an uptick in travel that would explain the rise

1518
01:24:32,896 --> 01:24:34,176
Making matters more concerning

1519
01:24:34,432 --> 01:24:38,016
In 2015 there were only 40 overnight stays for personnel

1520
01:24:38,272 --> 01:24:38,784
At that location

1521
01:24:39,552 --> 01:24:43,136
Not the hotel like that to airport

1522
01:24:44,928 --> 01:24:46,208
Is that number jump

1523
01:24:46,464 --> 01:24:47,232
When Trump was elected

1524
01:24:47,488 --> 01:24:49,024
And this year there have been 200

1525
01:24:49,280 --> 01:24:50,560
20 overnight stays log

1526
01:24:51,072 --> 01:24:52,608
Which is an over 500%

1527
01:24:52,864 --> 01:24:56,704
Increase in overnight stays at the airport happens to be near one of Trump's proper

1528
01:24:57,728 --> 01:24:59,520
But it's not like dropping a business arranged

1529
01:24:59,776 --> 01:25:01,568
Maybe Prestwick airport cuz that would be crazy

1530
01:25:02,592 --> 01:25:07,712
That Donald Trump does indeed have a business arrangement with Prestwick Airport

1531
01:25:08,224 --> 01:25:10,016
The guardian among other news outlets

1532
01:25:10,272 --> 01:25:13,344
Have reported the trumpet Prestwick entered into a ranch and arranged

1533
01:25:13,856 --> 01:25:16,160
We're Trump's Resort offer cut-price lodging for

1534
01:25:16,416 --> 01:25:22,048
People flying into the airport and Trump

1535
01:25:23,328 --> 01:25:26,144
Both the airport and resort we're losing money previous

1536
01:25:26,400 --> 01:25:27,680
What do you know now they're not

1537
01:25:28,192 --> 01:25:33,312
This is a case where it doesn't even really matter if Trump knows what's going on or is directing the increase traffic

1538
01:25:33,568 --> 01:25:34,080
Victor Prestwick

1539
01:25:34,336 --> 01:25:35,616
It legitimately doesn't matter

1540
01:25:35,872 --> 01:25:39,456
Because the appearance of impropriety is strong enough that this needs to stop

1541
01:25:39,968 --> 01:25:46,112
The president has a pre-existing arrangement to help increase traffic to this airport and now that he's present at the military stopping their weight

1542
01:25:47,904 --> 01:25:48,928
Whether this is the result of

1543
01:25:49,184 --> 01:25:49,952
Coordinated corrupt

1544
01:25:50,208 --> 01:25:52,512
Activity or not it does not matter

1545
01:25:52,768 --> 01:25:54,816
This is the consequence of having someone in office

1546
01:25:55,072 --> 01:25:56,096
Who has resorts

1547
01:25:56,352 --> 01:25:57,120
Conflict of interest

1548
01:25:57,376 --> 01:25:59,424
Its exact reason why the emoluments clause

1549
01:25:59,680 --> 01:26:00,192
Exist

1550
01:26:00,960 --> 01:26:01,984
Jimmy Carter got rid of

1551
01:26:03,264 --> 01:26:05,056
This is in the Constitution

1552
01:26:05,312 --> 01:26:10,432
Professes to love so much

1553
01:26:10,944 --> 01:26:12,992
He knows the Trump is profiting off being present

1554
01:26:13,248 --> 01:26:16,064
Whether he's directing corrupt behaviour or not

1555
01:26:16,320 --> 01:26:17,088
And Alex doesn't

1556
01:26:17,344 --> 01:26:17,856
Care

1557
01:26:18,112 --> 01:26:18,624
He supports

1558
01:26:19,392 --> 01:26:23,488
He claims the media covering a story like this is him lying of other lying about Trump

1559
01:26:23,744 --> 01:26:24,256
Which is such a

1560
01:26:24,512 --> 01:26:27,840
Through the Looking-Glass authoritarian

1561
01:26:28,096 --> 01:26:30,144
What a f****** loser he's become

1562
01:26:31,168 --> 01:26:32,704
Waterford

1563
01:26:32,960 --> 01:26:34,752
President to be able to profit off his

1564
01:26:35,008 --> 01:26:40,896
Be the president

1565
01:26:41,408 --> 01:26:42,688
The people who loves

1566
01:26:43,712 --> 01:26:44,480
Most of the people

1567
01:26:44,736 --> 01:26:46,272
Who have a copy of it

1568
01:26:46,528 --> 01:26:48,064
Is very small copy in their back

1569
01:26:48,320 --> 01:26:49,344
Pocket at all times

1570
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:50,112
Are we

1571
01:26:50,624 --> 01:26:51,648
The president

1572
01:26:52,928 --> 01:26:53,440
And they are

1573
01:26:54,208 --> 01:26:54,720
It's

1574
01:26:57,536 --> 01:26:58,048
Covered konst

1575
01:26:58,304 --> 01:27:00,352
It's so insane

1576
01:27:01,376 --> 01:27:03,168
Despondent

1577
01:27:03,424 --> 01:27:05,472
In the middle of the September 10th episode

1578
01:27:05,984 --> 01:27:08,288
Starts talking about

1579
01:27:08,800 --> 01:27:10,336
How wide

1580
01:27:12,128 --> 01:27:12,896
Before it's all over

1581
01:27:13,408 --> 01:27:13,920
For his peeps

1582
01:27:15,968 --> 01:27:22,112
Dennis gets weird remember how much I screamed about how he should have been impeached on day one cuz he was

1583
01:27:26,464 --> 01:27:28,768
Alex Azar

1584
01:27:29,024 --> 01:27:31,328
Extreme

1585
01:27:31,584 --> 01:27:32,608
Is that you get to recycle

1586
01:27:32,864 --> 01:27:33,376
Their pits

1587
01:27:33,632 --> 01:27:39,008
Always been but this one's pretty f****** over

1588
01:27:39,264 --> 01:27:42,848
Is like it's amazing to me that if you just have an authoritarian

1589
01:27:43,360 --> 01:27:43,872
Blitzwinger

1590
01:27:44,128 --> 01:27:44,640
The Senate

1591
01:27:44,896 --> 01:27:47,968
You can never do anything for the authoritarian white Nash

1592
01:27:48,736 --> 01:27:49,504
Mr. president

1593
01:27:49,760 --> 01:27:51,296
You don't think that's something we should be

1594
01:27:51,552 --> 01:27:53,088
Be surprised by course

1595
01:27:53,344 --> 01:27:53,856
Of course

1596
01:27:54,112 --> 01:27:54,624
But it's just

1597
01:27:55,648 --> 01:27:58,464
It's one of those things where we should probably rewrite that Constitution

1598
01:27:58,976 --> 01:28:00,000
If it's

1599
01:28:00,256 --> 01:28:01,792
So easy to s*** on it and

1600
01:28:02,048 --> 01:28:02,560
Enforce people that

1601
01:28:03,072 --> 01:28:04,608
Maybe I don't know

1602
01:28:04,864 --> 01:28:05,888
But either way

1603
01:28:06,144 --> 01:28:10,240
Alex is keenly aware that there is a approaching where he is

1604
01:28:10,496 --> 01:28:11,008
He will be stock

1605
01:28:12,800 --> 01:28:16,384
Interesting but I also think it's really interesting where he goes from there which is

1606
01:28:16,640 --> 01:28:17,664
She's a little bit Petty

1607
01:28:19,712 --> 01:28:20,480
24

1608
01:28:20,992 --> 01:28:21,504
We're done

1609
01:28:22,272 --> 01:28:23,808
Numbers

1610
01:28:29,184 --> 01:28:30,720
Unless all conservatives get up

1611
01:28:37,632 --> 01:28:43,008
Farms and ranches

1612
01:28:51,712 --> 01:28:52,736
Take a turn

1613
01:28:52,992 --> 01:28:54,784
Call up there

1614
01:28:56,576 --> 01:28:58,880
Only thing they give their money to Walmart

1615
01:29:03,488 --> 01:29:05,024
Ajani Oliver East Texas

1616
01:29:05,536 --> 01:29:06,816
Wealthy welder

1617
01:29:23,200 --> 01:29:24,224
Diamond skin

1618
01:29:31,648 --> 01:29:34,208
All you so-called Republican

1619
01:29:55,712 --> 01:29:57,248
I'm going to say

1620
01:29:57,760 --> 01:29:58,528
Back me up on

1621
01:29:59,040 --> 01:30:01,088
If I'm right okay choice

1622
01:30:02,624 --> 01:30:06,976
Maneater might be weird there

1623
01:30:13,376 --> 01:30:13,888
And family

1624
01:30:16,704 --> 01:30:22,848
Lot like what you described only because they won't give him money

1625
01:30:34,880 --> 01:30:40,768
Walmart hates America cuz they won't sell certain types of obvious

1626
01:30:47,424 --> 01:30:50,752
My family won't give me money

1627
01:30:51,008 --> 01:30:52,288
Yeah so that's funny

1628
01:30:53,824 --> 01:30:57,152
Because makes it funnier

1629
01:30:57,920 --> 01:31:00,736
But I think it's something really important that we need to talk about at the beginning

1630
01:31:01,760 --> 01:31:05,856
Alex couldn't make it more clear that is a white nationalist unless you just started screaming

1631
01:31:07,648 --> 01:31:10,976
What are you talkin about the idea that Democrats are going to have the numbers

1632
01:31:12,256 --> 01:31:18,400
I'll get it by 2024

1633
01:31:18,656 --> 01:31:19,936
Tomographic anxiety crowd

1634
01:31:20,960 --> 01:31:25,056
Most of the fears about White's becoming a minority or framed as being about the year 2045

1635
01:31:25,824 --> 01:31:26,336
That's weird

1636
01:31:26,592 --> 01:31:32,736
Constantly make up just slightly less than 50% of the US population which of course is a

1637
01:31:32,992 --> 01:31:33,760
A fate worse than death

1638
01:31:34,272 --> 01:31:35,808
Absolutely

1639
01:31:36,064 --> 01:31:37,088
Continue to control every

1640
01:31:37,600 --> 01:31:38,624
Destroyed

1641
01:31:38,880 --> 01:31:41,696
Some of those traces back to work put out by the Brookings

1642
01:31:42,208 --> 01:31:45,024
To who made this exact prediction in a report published life

1643
01:31:45,280 --> 01:31:45,792
September

1644
01:31:46,048 --> 01:31:50,144
The 2045 date is a big talking point but if you look at the graphs of their projections

1645
01:31:50,400 --> 01:31:53,216
2024 is also a very important point

1646
01:31:53,472 --> 01:31:55,776
For people who are super invested in white identity

1647
01:31:56,544 --> 01:32:00,640
That's the year that the white population will have an annual growth rate of 0 per

1648
01:32:01,408 --> 01:32:02,176
Meaning the birth

1649
01:32:02,432 --> 01:32:03,456
Death rate will be equipped

1650
01:32:04,480 --> 01:32:06,528
This isn't essentially important

1651
01:32:07,040 --> 01:32:10,368
Because it's the turning point after which the white population will begin to

1652
01:32:11,392 --> 01:32:14,720
Which again is something that they don't see as a natural phenomenon and opens

1653
01:32:14,976 --> 01:32:19,584
Society as much as they see it as a prominent international plan set up by evil globalist

1654
01:32:22,144 --> 01:32:23,936
This rant is about nothing

1655
01:32:24,192 --> 01:32:25,216
Except his demographic

1656
01:32:25,984 --> 01:32:27,008
This is white panic

1657
01:32:27,264 --> 01:32:27,776
Embodied

1658
01:32:28,032 --> 01:32:31,360
It's scary and sad on one leg

1659
01:32:31,872 --> 01:32:38,016
He's so afraid of white people not being the majority in the country that he completely flips out starts screaming about his Rich relatives don't give him money

1660
01:32:38,528 --> 01:32:39,552
It's the embodiment of

1661
01:32:39,808 --> 01:32:41,088
Pathetic entitled bigotry

1662
01:32:41,344 --> 01:32:43,392
It's not I don't know what is

1663
01:32:43,648 --> 01:32:45,440
It's just it's over to me

1664
01:32:48,768 --> 01:32:50,048
Surviving Koch brother doing

1665
01:32:50,304 --> 01:32:50,816
That would be

1666
01:32:51,072 --> 01:32:52,352
That would be

1667
01:32:53,120 --> 01:32:54,400
Pathetic

1668
01:32:58,496 --> 01:33:03,616
Financially and emotionally and clearly

1669
01:33:03,872 --> 01:33:05,664
Real into

1670
01:33:07,456 --> 01:33:08,224
So

1671
01:33:10,272 --> 01:33:11,552
People off and understandably

1672
01:33:13,088 --> 01:33:14,624
I keep the same because

1673
01:33:16,160 --> 01:33:16,672
You know

1674
01:33:17,184 --> 01:33:19,232
It's important to know what Alex believes

1675
01:33:19,744 --> 01:33:20,512
Even if it's like

1676
01:33:20,768 --> 01:33:22,048
This is terrible

1677
01:33:22,304 --> 01:33:24,096
Pretty terrible

1678
01:33:24,864 --> 01:33:30,752
Projections onto

1679
01:33:31,008 --> 01:33:33,824
He's talking about the beginning of psychiatric

1680
01:33:34,080 --> 01:33:40,224
Conditions in psychological camp

1681
01:33:40,480 --> 01:33:42,528
But they acted like they were new or something

1682
01:33:42,784 --> 01:33:43,296
Okay

1683
01:33:43,808 --> 01:33:44,320
Then it gets worse

1684
01:33:51,488 --> 01:33:52,256
It really is a thing

1685
01:33:52,512 --> 01:33:53,536
It's a whole bunch of

1686
01:33:54,560 --> 01:33:55,328
Poison

1687
01:33:55,584 --> 01:33:56,864
Are they

1688
01:34:01,728 --> 01:34:03,008
A dimensional program

1689
01:34:15,296 --> 01:34:21,184
So all the psychiatric conditions and all that s*** it's real

1690
01:34:21,440 --> 01:34:22,720
But it's probably

1691
01:34:22,976 --> 01:34:25,024
Poison or demon

1692
01:34:25,280 --> 01:34:27,840
Or some

1693
01:34:28,352 --> 01:34:31,680
A man f*** was that it's pretty crazy

1694
01:34:31,936 --> 01:34:33,216
So his

1695
01:34:35,008 --> 01:34:36,288
Is based off of

1696
01:34:36,544 --> 01:34:38,848
Telling people who are are you there poisoned

1697
01:34:41,152 --> 01:34:43,456
Tell me more about genetical inbreeding

1698
01:34:46,784 --> 01:34:47,552
Possessed by demons

1699
01:34:48,064 --> 01:34:52,416
3 in the same person

1700
01:34:52,672 --> 01:34:55,744
Right absolutely

1701
01:35:01,376 --> 01:35:01,888
Problem

1702
01:35:02,400 --> 01:35:05,472
Avakin add new names

1703
01:35:05,728 --> 01:35:08,800
I guess an exorcism

1704
01:35:11,872 --> 01:35:12,384
Massive

1705
01:35:12,640 --> 01:35:13,152
Amount

1706
01:35:13,920 --> 01:35:18,016
Which Mike

1707
01:35:19,296 --> 01:35:21,856
Yeah I mean it's

1708
01:35:22,112 --> 01:35:23,392
Just from a mental health

1709
01:35:23,648 --> 01:35:25,952
I think it's really disgusting

1710
01:35:26,464 --> 01:35:26,976
2

1711
01:35:27,232 --> 01:35:27,744
Save this way

1712
01:35:28,768 --> 01:35:29,280
Considering it sounds

1713
01:35:29,792 --> 01:35:30,560
Somebody told him he had so

1714
01:35:31,328 --> 01:35:32,096
Get the Frederick

1715
01:35:32,352 --> 01:35:33,632
And he decided that he was actually

1716
01:35:33,888 --> 01:35:35,168
Poisoned

1717
01:35:35,680 --> 01:35:36,960
I just got to do a client

1718
01:35:37,216 --> 01:35:42,592
Dangerous

1719
01:35:42,848 --> 01:35:46,176
Least believes conditions are real

1720
01:35:47,200 --> 01:35:51,808
It's a sad State of Affairs that you like that is like

1721
01:35:52,064 --> 01:35:53,600
Brightside is B

1722
01:35:53,856 --> 01:35:55,136
The bar has been set

1723
01:35:55,392 --> 01:35:56,160
Solo

1724
01:35:56,672 --> 01:36:00,768
Yeah you have finally jumped over it into a further middle

1725
01:36:01,280 --> 01:36:01,792
Morass

1726
01:36:02,816 --> 01:36:03,328
Yeah

1727
01:36:03,584 --> 01:36:04,864
Kohl's

1728
01:36:05,120 --> 01:36:09,728
At this point

1729
01:36:11,008 --> 01:36:12,544
Because of this stupid idea

1730
01:36:14,336 --> 01:36:16,384
Stupid idea that we've covered in

1731
01:36:16,896 --> 01:36:17,408
But Alex

1732
01:36:18,176 --> 01:36:19,968
Put out and I kind of thought maybe

1733
01:36:20,480 --> 01:36:21,248
He was going to let this one

1734
01:36:21,504 --> 01:36:24,064
No no

1735
01:36:24,576 --> 01:36:27,904
What would you do if I forget about buying Iceland

1736
01:36:31,488 --> 01:36:32,512
It sure is nice

1737
01:36:43,776 --> 01:36:44,800
Alex really

1738
01:36:48,640 --> 01:36:49,664
Does he think that's how

1739
01:36:52,224 --> 01:36:52,992
He just kind of think

1740
01:36:53,248 --> 01:36:55,040
You can just give all of Greenland buddy

1741
01:36:55,296 --> 01:36:56,320
And then they give you Greenland

1742
01:37:02,464 --> 01:37:03,488
Not

1743
01:37:03,744 --> 01:37:05,792
Pretty into the idea of

1744
01:37:06,048 --> 01:37:06,560
Expanding

1745
01:37:06,816 --> 01:37:08,608
Yeah cuz he couldn't just let that one go

1746
01:37:14,240 --> 01:37:14,752
Is what I prefer

1747
01:37:15,264 --> 01:37:16,288
Learn

1748
01:37:16,544 --> 01:37:17,056
As I said

1749
01:37:17,312 --> 01:37:20,128
Conversation about how

1750
01:37:20,384 --> 01:37:22,176
The globalist we're really just trying

1751
01:37:22,432 --> 01:37:23,200
Dubai time

1752
01:37:23,712 --> 01:37:24,736
Cuz they do they need

1753
01:37:24,992 --> 01:37:25,760
2

1754
01:37:26,016 --> 01:37:26,784
Steal the 2020

1755
01:37:27,552 --> 01:37:28,320
And all this s***

1756
01:37:29,600 --> 01:37:30,112
That is this

1757
01:37:30,624 --> 01:37:33,952
Hot b******* that leads to like one of the craziest things

1758
01:37:37,280 --> 01:37:38,048
That I've heard Alex

1759
01:37:39,328 --> 01:37:45,472
And that's why he's accelerating action now because he realizes their whole endgame was just to buy time

1760
01:37:45,728 --> 01:37:48,800
Manipulate

1761
01:37:54,944 --> 01:37:56,224
People

1762
01:37:56,992 --> 01:37:58,272
Six-year-old

1763
01:37:59,808 --> 01:38:02,112
Public School

1764
01:38:02,368 --> 01:38:05,440
To go with men at parks the bathroom have sex with

1765
01:38:14,656 --> 01:38:16,448
If Alex Jones Is On Air

1766
01:38:19,008 --> 01:38:20,288
No one's going to have

1767
01:38:21,312 --> 01:38:26,688
Well the globalist books in public school library

1768
01:38:27,712 --> 01:38:33,856
Training manuals of all the things I absolutely do not need to look up to tell you is not true this is probably

1769
01:38:34,112 --> 01:38:34,624
On the top of that

1770
01:38:35,392 --> 01:38:40,768
There is no public school that is teaching a book that encourages six-year-olds to go to park bathrooms with strange man and headset

1771
01:38:41,280 --> 01:38:43,840
I rarely drops 100% bulshit

1772
01:38:44,096 --> 01:38:46,912
You know and that's one of those fun things that disproved the Infiniti

1773
01:38:48,960 --> 01:38:51,776
Just because it is possible doesn't mean that it's going to

1774
01:38:52,288 --> 01:38:54,080
No I decided to look it up anyway

1775
01:38:54,336 --> 01:38:56,896
Such a book exist

1776
01:38:57,408 --> 01:38:58,688
I think I know what's going on

1777
01:38:59,712 --> 01:39:05,856
There's a 2015 law in California that recently went into effect their required school education curriculum

1778
01:39:06,112 --> 01:39:09,696
Material related to lgbtq folks

1779
01:39:09,952 --> 01:39:12,512
So you know the right-wing is doubly pissed off about it

1780
01:39:13,024 --> 01:39:15,584
You can make whatever you are argument you want for against

1781
01:39:15,840 --> 01:39:18,656
Curriculum board public health information

1782
01:39:18,912 --> 01:39:19,680
Agree with you

1783
01:39:19,936 --> 01:39:22,752
You can say that you'd rather teach your child that stuff at home

1784
01:39:23,008 --> 01:39:24,288
Your parenting none of that matters

1785
01:39:24,544 --> 01:39:29,152
Because the bill is very explicitly in the fact that

1786
01:39:29,408 --> 01:39:30,944
After children out of the car

1787
01:39:31,712 --> 01:39:33,504
You don't want

1788
01:39:33,760 --> 01:39:34,528
Problem solved

1789
01:39:35,552 --> 01:39:36,320
Is it on issue

1790
01:39:36,832 --> 01:39:42,976
I read an article about this must be talking about domestic abuse

1791
01:39:43,232 --> 01:39:43,744
Sex trafficking

1792
01:39:46,560 --> 01:39:49,120
In a book about how you shouldn't go to the bathroom with a stranger

1793
01:39:49,376 --> 01:39:49,888
And arguing

1794
01:39:50,144 --> 01:39:53,216
Secretly as a way of trying to get children curious about a condom

1795
01:39:53,472 --> 01:39:54,752
Remember

1796
01:39:55,008 --> 01:39:56,288
Specialty

1797
01:39:56,544 --> 01:39:57,056
He's telling you what there

1798
01:39:57,312 --> 01:39:58,336
Exactly

1799
01:39:58,848 --> 01:40:01,408
It makes no sense but if you used to listen to Alex

1800
01:40:01,664 --> 01:40:02,688
Kind of how his brain works

1801
01:40:03,968 --> 01:40:05,760
This article has some interesting comments on it

1802
01:40:06,016 --> 01:40:07,040
Here's a

1803
01:40:09,600 --> 01:40:10,112
Non bigoted

1804
01:40:10,624 --> 01:40:15,232
We're not fighting lgbtq people per se but their agenda

1805
01:40:15,488 --> 01:40:18,816
That's obviously to create more of them by infiltrating the public school

1806
01:40:19,584 --> 01:40:20,096
Cool stuff

1807
01:40:21,376 --> 01:40:22,144
The good angle on this

1808
01:40:22,400 --> 01:40:22,912
Wow

1809
01:40:23,168 --> 01:40:29,312
So I assume is what I was talking about since that complaints about the curriculum for making the rounds a little bit in the right-wing Spears

1810
01:40:29,568 --> 01:40:31,360
Stanford misleading headline in

1811
01:40:31,616 --> 01:40:33,408
Decided to report it even more misleadingly

1812
01:40:33,664 --> 01:40:34,944
But here's the larger point

1813
01:40:35,456 --> 01:40:38,272
This is the first example you can come up with for why the world needs

1814
01:40:38,784 --> 01:40:39,296
To be on air

1815
01:40:39,552 --> 01:40:43,904
If it weren't for him no one would know this completely fake about a book telling kids

1816
01:40:44,160 --> 01:40:45,696
Dafuq strange man in park bathroom

1817
01:40:45,952 --> 01:40:48,768
How is evidence of the globalists trying to steal your children

1818
01:40:49,280 --> 01:40:52,352
Alex is actually making a very compelling argument for why Society

1819
01:40:52,608 --> 01:40:55,680
To not be on the air on the other hand

1820
01:40:55,936 --> 01:40:57,728
We wouldn't know about this

1821
01:40:59,264 --> 01:41:00,032
Again

1822
01:41:00,288 --> 01:41:03,104
Not true thing

1823
01:41:05,152 --> 01:41:09,248
Alex

1824
01:41:10,272 --> 01:41:11,552
Everything is really smart

1825
01:41:12,064 --> 01:41:12,576
No

1826
01:41:12,832 --> 01:41:13,600
He is

1827
01:41:13,856 --> 01:41:15,392
Smart

1828
01:41:17,440 --> 01:41:18,464
Maybe conniving

1829
01:41:21,536 --> 01:41:23,840
About replace John Bolton

1830
01:41:24,352 --> 01:41:26,144
Right we got to get a guy in there

1831
01:41:26,400 --> 01:41:29,216
No Alex earlier was ruminating on this point

1832
01:41:29,472 --> 01:41:29,984
He had no idea

1833
01:41:30,752 --> 01:41:31,776
YouTube weird

1834
01:41:32,288 --> 01:41:36,640
Sort of like kicking the can down the street by doing

1835
01:41:36,896 --> 01:41:37,408
See who he thinks

1836
01:41:43,552 --> 01:41:46,880
Podcasts

1837
01:41:47,392 --> 01:41:52,256
Cuz it turned out I don't actually know anything

1838
01:41:53,024 --> 01:41:55,328
Ask Barnes

1839
01:41:55,584 --> 01:41:58,912
Replace the voltage is answer is not good

1840
01:42:01,472 --> 01:42:05,568
For someone that has

1841
01:42:05,824 --> 01:42:07,616
Was realistic

1842
01:42:08,128 --> 01:42:09,920
Realpolitik instincts

1843
01:42:12,736 --> 01:42:14,784
Practical strategic advice that is

1844
01:42:15,040 --> 01:42:16,832
Insisted

1845
01:42:18,368 --> 01:42:20,160
So you want

1846
01:42:24,768 --> 01:42:25,792
Price Barnes

1847
01:42:26,816 --> 01:42:27,328
Good work

1848
01:42:28,864 --> 01:42:30,144
That's a sad

1849
01:42:30,400 --> 01:42:33,216
That's disgusting

1850
01:42:33,472 --> 01:42:36,032
For you want to replace that

1851
01:42:36,288 --> 01:42:39,872
Sebastian Gorka

1852
01:42:40,384 --> 01:42:41,152
Sebastian Gorka

1853
01:42:41,408 --> 01:42:41,920
Is giving you

1854
01:42:42,176 --> 01:42:44,224
Spain reasonable advice on

1855
01:42:44,480 --> 01:42:45,248
Literally any

1856
01:42:45,504 --> 01:42:46,528
I don't want to know

1857
01:42:46,784 --> 01:42:48,320
I don't want a movie recommendation

1858
01:42:48,832 --> 01:42:49,600
Sebastian Gorka

1859
01:42:51,648 --> 01:42:53,440
Go to call

1860
01:42:53,696 --> 01:42:55,744
Caller

1861
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:57,280
Colleges brings it up on his own

1862
01:42:57,536 --> 01:42:58,048
He's got another

1863
01:42:58,304 --> 01:42:59,072
Suggestion of who needs

1864
01:42:59,328 --> 01:43:00,352
To replace both

1865
01:43:00,864 --> 01:43:01,888
If this is interesting

1866
01:43:02,144 --> 01:43:04,960
Because it's Spyros super out of control

1867
01:43:05,472 --> 01:43:07,520
Alex is really excited about this idea

1868
01:43:08,032 --> 01:43:10,592
Today is

1869
01:43:11,104 --> 01:43:15,200
I think we need is a constitutionally and very strict

1870
01:43:15,456 --> 01:43:18,528
Sports to clear out the bad apples that are in the various

1871
01:43:18,784 --> 01:43:21,088
Agencies networks that we have operating

1872
01:43:21,344 --> 01:43:22,880
Like the present

1873
01:43:27,232 --> 01:43:30,560
Understands the promise software the Pegasus malware

1874
01:43:36,192 --> 01:43:41,568
Operate outside

1875
01:43:50,016 --> 01:43:51,808
Special military

1876
01:43:52,064 --> 01:43:53,600
The president

1877
01:43:57,952 --> 01:44:04,096
Walkthrough

1878
01:44:05,376 --> 01:44:11,520
Squad Odd Squad

1879
01:44:11,776 --> 01:44:12,288
Also it's

1880
01:44:12,544 --> 01:44:16,128
Almost parody for someone like him to not recognize

1881
01:44:16,384 --> 01:44:18,944
How close is what you suggested

1882
01:44:19,200 --> 01:44:20,992
Also William

1883
01:44:21,248 --> 01:44:22,272
A f****** Seth rich

1884
01:44:22,528 --> 01:44:24,832
Is truther an embarrassment

1885
01:44:28,672 --> 01:44:30,720
Even his name would be thrown around

1886
01:44:32,256 --> 01:44:33,024
Ludicra

1887
01:44:33,792 --> 01:44:37,120
So great

1888
01:44:37,632 --> 01:44:38,656
Trust

1889
01:44:38,912 --> 01:44:40,192
Infowars

1890
01:44:43,264 --> 01:44:44,544
F****** Benny in there

1891
01:44:44,800 --> 01:44:45,824
Yeah great

1892
01:44:46,080 --> 01:44:50,176
What up

1893
01:44:50,432 --> 01:44:51,712
What a load of s***

1894
01:44:52,736 --> 01:44:53,504
Terrible idea

1895
01:44:54,016 --> 01:44:57,088
So I hear from September 10th

1896
01:44:57,344 --> 01:44:59,392
Is an indication of a new line of business

1897
01:45:00,672 --> 01:45:01,184
Miscommunication

1898
01:45:01,440 --> 01:45:01,952
Network is getting in

1899
01:45:03,232 --> 01:45:07,840
Active.com

1900
01:45:11,680 --> 01:45:13,216
Good job guys

1901
01:45:13,728 --> 01:45:17,312
The Hat game

1902
01:45:17,824 --> 01:45:21,920
I think it would be I wouldn't be surprised if you just straight-up sold drugs on the

1903
01:45:23,456 --> 01:45:26,784
How many

1904
01:45:27,040 --> 01:45:27,808
Frozen beef

1905
01:45:29,344 --> 01:45:32,416
It's just not a young Japanese stuff too but

1906
01:45:35,232 --> 01:45:40,608
Yeah it was largely motivated clearly by TCM

1907
01:45:42,400 --> 01:45:44,192
The frontman for

1908
01:45:44,448 --> 01:45:45,472
Gcn's involved

1909
01:45:45,728 --> 01:45:46,752
What's your name

1910
01:45:47,008 --> 01:45:49,312
Gotcha based on how things shake out

1911
01:45:52,384 --> 01:45:54,688
Legal marijuana

1912
01:45:54,944 --> 01:45:58,784
Market it makes sense for them it's like a lateral move in Minnesota

1913
01:46:00,064 --> 01:46:01,600
But

1914
01:46:03,904 --> 01:46:04,672
Yeah

1915
01:46:05,184 --> 01:46:08,768
R Us

1916
01:46:10,304 --> 01:46:16,448
So we get to September 11th and I was expecting this is just going to be 11 91

1917
01:46:16,704 --> 01:46:18,752
911

1918
01:46:19,776 --> 01:46:21,568
Really quickly caught a theme

1919
01:46:21,824 --> 01:46:22,848
That was going on

1920
01:46:23,360 --> 01:46:24,384
And that is the Alex

1921
01:46:24,640 --> 01:46:25,152
Trying

1922
01:46:25,408 --> 01:46:25,920
To turn

1923
01:46:26,432 --> 01:46:28,736
911 into is abortion

1924
01:46:28,992 --> 01:46:29,504
Narrative

1925
01:46:30,528 --> 01:46:31,808
His argument seems

1926
01:46:32,064 --> 01:46:34,112
To be throughout this is like 9/11 was bad

1927
01:46:34,624 --> 01:46:36,672
Only 3,000

1928
01:46:38,208 --> 01:46:41,024
So many more have died from abortions

1929
01:46:43,072 --> 01:46:44,608
It was very weird

1930
01:46:44,864 --> 01:46:45,376
Encounter

1931
01:46:45,632 --> 01:46:49,984
We get this first clip here and I was just talking about like seeing abortion protest

1932
01:46:50,496 --> 01:46:53,312
And I've seen the videos that he's talking about

1933
01:46:53,568 --> 01:46:54,080
I know this

1934
01:46:54,592 --> 01:46:55,360
These are people f******

1935
01:47:01,248 --> 01:47:02,528
Did this is how he acts.

1936
01:47:03,040 --> 01:47:04,320
Weather sincerely or not

1937
01:47:04,576 --> 01:47:06,880
This is how he packages that to his audio

1938
01:47:07,648 --> 01:47:09,952
Years ago they were about to pass

1939
01:47:13,280 --> 01:47:13,792
Back

1940
01:47:26,336 --> 01:47:27,872
This is real

1941
01:47:29,152 --> 01:47:30,688
Who wants children

1942
01:47:34,528 --> 01:47:35,296
When I get the best

1943
01:47:37,344 --> 01:47:39,648
Followers out there

1944
01:47:48,608 --> 01:47:52,192
Bingo

1945
01:47:55,264 --> 01:47:57,824
Chrome shade going on again

1946
01:47:58,336 --> 01:47:59,616
Right

1947
01:48:01,152 --> 01:48:01,920
Negative

1948
01:48:02,688 --> 01:48:06,784
So I mean this is this is a lot of leads me back today

1949
01:48:07,808 --> 01:48:10,880
Mike with his Facebook post that he's pretending isn't people f****** around

1950
01:48:11,136 --> 01:48:13,952
How much is Alex aware of the fact these people are just talking with him

1951
01:48:15,488 --> 01:48:19,072
To pretend he doesn't understand that he actually believe

1952
01:48:19,328 --> 01:48:21,120
That these people were hissing and acting

1953
01:48:21,376 --> 01:48:27,264
I really I really would never think

1954
01:48:31,104 --> 01:48:33,664
True but also a rational person with a malicious

1955
01:48:33,920 --> 01:48:35,456
Agenda

1956
01:48:35,712 --> 01:48:41,856
Take that I feel like I could use this

1957
01:48:43,136 --> 01:48:43,648
It's f****** fake

1958
01:48:43,904 --> 01:48:46,464
Here's kind of my operating Theory on

1959
01:48:46,720 --> 01:48:49,536
Hey that you stupid V evil conundrum we often

1960
01:48:50,048 --> 01:48:50,560
Ourselves in

1961
01:48:51,072 --> 01:48:51,840
I think it

1962
01:48:52,096 --> 01:48:52,864
Starts out

1963
01:48:53,376 --> 01:48:54,144
With him knowing

1964
01:48:54,912 --> 01:48:56,704
That he's creating this false

1965
01:48:57,728 --> 01:48:58,240
He knows

1966
01:48:58,496 --> 01:48:59,264
He knows it's a joke

1967
01:48:59,776 --> 01:49:01,312
He knows that he's creating a false

1968
01:49:02,336 --> 01:49:03,872
And I think eventually he whines up

1969
01:49:04,128 --> 01:49:05,152
Convincing himself that

1970
01:49:06,432 --> 01:49:09,760
That could be how I always feel like this goes

1971
01:49:10,016 --> 01:49:14,368
He jumps into the vat of goo

1972
01:49:14,880 --> 01:49:15,392
Exact

1973
01:49:15,648 --> 01:49:18,208
That could be from

1974
01:49:18,464 --> 01:49:19,744
From everything that we've

1975
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:21,792
The only thing the kind of

1976
01:49:23,328 --> 01:49:24,352
Him both being a hot

1977
01:49:24,608 --> 01:49:25,888
A huckster a liar

1978
01:49:26,144 --> 01:49:26,912
And a lunatic

1979
01:49:27,168 --> 01:49:29,728
Ecobee he convinces him

1980
01:49:29,984 --> 01:49:32,544
I'm selfish autopilot Salat

1981
01:49:32,800 --> 01:49:33,312
Now

1982
01:49:33,568 --> 01:49:36,128
The centerpiece of Alex's abortion argument

1983
01:49:36,384 --> 01:49:36,896
Cities make

1984
01:49:38,944 --> 01:49:40,224
PS2 resistance

1985
01:49:40,736 --> 01:49:42,784
Is a new report that Paul Joseph Watson

1986
01:49:43,040 --> 01:49:43,552
And put out

1987
01:49:44,576 --> 01:49:50,720
This is not work I think that that is either an intent like I think that was there in

1988
01:49:53,536 --> 01:49:56,352
It was another attempt

1989
01:49:56,608 --> 01:49:57,632
To find ways

1990
01:49:57,888 --> 01:49:59,424
To have non-band website

1991
01:49:59,680 --> 01:50:02,240
Right right right news would be

1992
01:50:09,408 --> 01:50:10,944
I think that might be what it is

1993
01:50:11,200 --> 01:50:13,248
I don't know it's really tough to say but

1994
01:50:13,760 --> 01:50:16,064
It was happening

1995
01:50:16,320 --> 01:50:17,344
YouTube Paul Joseph Watson

1996
01:50:17,600 --> 01:50:18,880
The best actor in the world

1997
01:50:19,136 --> 01:50:22,208
Sincerely didn't want to be around out I don't know

1998
01:50:22,464 --> 01:50:24,256
I don't know what to make of it I don't really care

1999
01:50:24,768 --> 01:50:26,304
My point gear Jordans

2000
01:50:26,560 --> 01:50:27,584
Is it I would

2001
01:50:27,840 --> 01:50:29,632
Never talked about it Paul Joseph Watson

2002
01:50:29,888 --> 01:50:32,960
Report if I didn't find something about it

2003
01:50:33,216 --> 01:50:33,984
Because they're unlistenable

2004
01:50:34,240 --> 01:50:34,752
This

2005
01:50:35,008 --> 01:50:35,776
Is amazed

2006
01:50:43,456 --> 01:50:48,576
Did you hear about the new sexual

2007
01:51:03,680 --> 01:51:05,984
Apparently he was just

2008
01:51:18,272 --> 01:51:18,784
So

2009
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:28,512
Sure

2010
01:51:30,816 --> 01:51:32,608
Is reading here I is very powerful

2011
01:51:32,864 --> 01:51:33,632
Special Report

2012
01:51:33,888 --> 01:51:36,704
It's a year old post on Reddit sardasht sex

2013
01:51:36,960 --> 01:51:37,472
Keyboard

2014
01:51:37,728 --> 01:51:43,872
Weird how you manage to find this post if you wasn't specifically looking for something

2015
01:51:44,128 --> 01:51:47,456
Royal decision to make 9/11 about abortion

2016
01:51:47,712 --> 01:51:53,600
Weird the post is a year-old it only got 18 comments and was 50% down

2017
01:51:53,856 --> 01:51:56,928
There's no way I would ever pop-up if you were just scrolling through Reddit

2018
01:51:57,440 --> 01:51:59,488
He had to be actively searching for this

2019
01:51:59,744 --> 01:52:00,512
Yeah that's

2020
01:52:01,536 --> 01:52:06,144
The reply, DePaul is reading down the thread

2021
01:52:08,704 --> 01:52:14,848
Does the rest of the comments could be summed up as this is messed up or I'm not sure I believe this story because people on

2022
01:52:15,104 --> 01:52:17,920
Reddit make stuff up all the time and this would sound very

2023
01:52:20,224 --> 01:52:25,344
So most people generally don't think the comments on Reddit really all that indicative

2024
01:52:29,184 --> 01:52:31,488
What are good ways you can kind of get a sense about someone since

2025
01:52:31,744 --> 01:52:33,792
Charity though

2026
01:52:34,560 --> 01:52:36,608
If all just watching it.

2027
01:52:36,864 --> 01:52:41,472
I had some journalistic reservations a credible source

2028
01:52:42,240 --> 01:52:43,264
Around the time they post

2029
01:52:43,520 --> 01:52:45,056
Did this question to Paul is reading

2030
01:52:45,568 --> 01:52:47,104
How about their friend

2031
01:52:49,408 --> 01:52:55,552
If you're on birth control and let's say 45 males come inside you vaginally around

2032
01:52:57,600 --> 01:52:58,368
Is my likelihood of getting

2033
01:52:58,624 --> 01:53:02,208
Or as far as your on birth control it doesn't matter how much

2034
01:53:02,464 --> 01:53:07,328
I personally have a copper IUD but I'm unsure if it's a male or

2035
01:53:09,888 --> 01:53:10,400
So funny

2036
01:53:10,912 --> 01:53:12,960
This person sounds like an idiot

2037
01:53:13,216 --> 01:53:14,496
And most likely a kid f******

2038
01:53:15,776 --> 01:53:17,312
This is further indicated by another post

2039
01:53:17,568 --> 01:53:18,592
Around that same time

2040
01:53:18,848 --> 01:53:23,200
Quote me and my four friends and fun at a home party

2041
01:53:23,456 --> 01:53:28,064
Now I'm a bit of a kinky girl that I did find some kinky ideas the boys had

2042
01:53:28,576 --> 01:53:34,464
We did end up with the idea of how much loads I can hold in my mouth and well we went for it

2043
01:53:40,352 --> 01:53:40,864
This is

2044
01:53:41,120 --> 01:53:41,632
Facile

2045
01:53:43,680 --> 01:53:45,728
There is no reason to be laughing at this right

2046
01:53:45,984 --> 01:53:52,128
We are grown adults if you read the other

2047
01:53:52,384 --> 01:53:56,480
Post this person is written a little experience trying to write erotica

2048
01:53:56,736 --> 01:54:01,856
And I come from a very strong

2049
01:54:03,392 --> 01:54:04,416
3 f****** ashamed of

2050
01:54:04,672 --> 01:54:05,440
Themselves

2051
01:54:06,464 --> 01:54:06,976
I bet

2052
01:54:09,024 --> 01:54:09,792
Really kind of

2053
01:54:10,048 --> 01:54:10,560
Envy

2054
01:54:11,072 --> 01:54:11,584
Call Josie

2055
01:54:12,352 --> 01:54:14,912
Solo

2056
01:54:15,424 --> 01:54:21,568
To do the hardest part is editing and he probably doesn't do it himself

2057
01:54:24,384 --> 01:54:26,432
He's a real fetish

2058
01:54:26,688 --> 01:54:28,224
Just not the getting tons of abortion

2059
01:54:29,248 --> 01:54:33,600
Squats and did some deeper research on the scholarly website

2060
01:54:33,856 --> 01:54:37,696
You would have found it ask me anything thread from a girl purporting to have this breed

2061
01:54:37,952 --> 01:54:38,464
Confederation

2062
01:54:38,720 --> 01:54:41,280
She explains that she's on birth control which is very common

2063
01:54:41,792 --> 01:54:43,840
From the people who are

2064
01:54:48,192 --> 01:54:49,472
Pregnancy

2065
01:54:49,728 --> 01:54:52,032
Little bit irresponsible

2066
01:54:52,544 --> 01:54:53,824
For the sexual Rush they'd get out of

2067
01:54:54,592 --> 01:54:58,432
And people have different reasons for enjoying the fetish too if you look at the people who talk about this

2068
01:54:59,712 --> 01:55:00,480
Bersama Sabattus

2069
01:55:00,736 --> 01:55:01,248
Submissiveness

2070
01:55:02,528 --> 01:55:04,832
Taboo given their life circumstances

2071
01:55:05,088 --> 01:55:07,648
Some men just really like how pregnant women look

2072
01:55:07,904 --> 01:55:10,720
It's a big old world out there

2073
01:55:10,976 --> 01:55:11,488
Community

2074
01:55:12,256 --> 01:55:14,304
This is a larger group of people who indulge in the

2075
01:55:14,560 --> 01:55:15,072
Miss fantasy

2076
01:55:15,328 --> 01:55:17,376
Most part it doesn't seem like they're hard

2077
01:55:17,632 --> 01:55:18,144
Anybody

2078
01:55:18,400 --> 01:55:19,680
Is it possible there's a

2079
01:55:19,936 --> 01:55:23,264
Very very small segment of the population

2080
01:55:23,520 --> 01:55:24,288
Finally gets abortions

2081
01:55:24,800 --> 01:55:28,896
No

2082
01:55:29,408 --> 01:55:34,272
Case specifically

2083
01:55:34,528 --> 01:55:39,136
That goes back to 2009 ABC news story about a woman named Irene Villar

2084
01:55:39,392 --> 01:55:40,928
It was a self-described abortion

2085
01:55:41,696 --> 01:55:43,488
Who wrote a book called impossible mother

2086
01:55:44,512 --> 01:55:45,024
However

2087
01:55:45,280 --> 01:55:47,840
Did you find her is just an abortion addict

2088
01:55:48,096 --> 01:55:49,376
Very unfair portrait

2089
01:55:50,400 --> 01:55:56,544
Villar was the granddaughter of Puerto Rican nationalist Lolita LeBron who stormed the US House of Representatives with a gun back in 90

2090
01:55:56,800 --> 01:55:57,568
54

2091
01:55:57,824 --> 01:55:58,848
Which put her into jail

2092
01:55:59,104 --> 01:55:59,872
For 25 years

2093
01:56:00,640 --> 01:56:02,432
LeBron I was sterilized

2094
01:56:02,688 --> 01:56:04,480
That's just part of the program in Puerto Rico

2095
01:56:04,736 --> 01:56:05,504
She was 33

2096
01:56:06,784 --> 01:56:09,088
Her family as a ghost

2097
01:56:09,344 --> 01:56:09,856
Hungover

2098
01:56:10,368 --> 01:56:10,880
Everyone

2099
01:56:11,136 --> 01:56:12,160
Reproductive

2100
01:56:12,928 --> 01:56:13,440
Life

2101
01:56:14,464 --> 01:56:15,488
Her mother would go on to

2102
01:56:15,744 --> 01:56:16,256
Commit suicide

2103
01:56:16,512 --> 01:56:17,792
Velar with 8 years old

2104
01:56:18,048 --> 01:56:19,584
Leaving to her I going away to boarding

2105
01:56:19,840 --> 01:56:20,352
School

2106
01:56:20,608 --> 01:56:23,936
Syracuse and emotionally abusive relationship

2107
01:56:24,192 --> 01:56:25,216
The 50-year old professor

2108
01:56:25,472 --> 01:56:27,264
Who is specifically opposed to children

2109
01:56:27,776 --> 01:56:29,824
Sing having them kill sexual desire

2110
01:56:30,336 --> 01:56:33,664
Most of the abortions that you got wear during this period where she was in a relationship

2111
01:56:33,920 --> 01:56:34,432
With this abusive

2112
01:56:35,200 --> 01:56:35,712
Right

2113
01:56:38,784 --> 01:56:42,112
It does appear so

2114
01:56:43,648 --> 01:56:46,464
Describes our abortions is a form of self-harm

2115
01:56:46,720 --> 01:56:48,512
If you look at the larger portrait of her life

2116
01:56:48,768 --> 01:56:49,792
It's very easy to see

2117
01:56:50,048 --> 01:56:53,376
Who's the person who suffered trauma in a very specific form that took this out

2118
01:56:53,888 --> 01:56:57,472
It has very little to do with a larger picture picture of abortion access

2119
01:56:59,264 --> 01:57:00,544
But people are serial abortion

2120
01:57:01,568 --> 01:57:03,872
Person I can't really find any evidence

2121
01:57:04,128 --> 01:57:04,640
The people who get a bunch

2122
01:57:05,152 --> 01:57:05,664
Abortions

2123
01:57:05,920 --> 01:57:06,432
Compulsively

2124
01:57:06,688 --> 01:57:12,832
That like the idea that this is a large community of people who do nor is there anyone from Planned Parenthood or any similar organs

2125
01:57:13,344 --> 01:57:13,856
Advocating

2126
01:57:14,880 --> 01:57:18,976
This is a straw man that Paul Joseph Watson is created out of a year old Reddit post

2127
01:57:19,232 --> 01:57:21,024
But he's dug up and pretended is

2128
01:57:21,536 --> 01:57:25,376
Specifically for the purpose of attacking women's rights to control their bodies and medical

2129
01:57:25,888 --> 01:57:26,656
Elizabeth

2130
01:57:26,912 --> 01:57:27,936
Two-player journalism because

2131
01:57:28,192 --> 01:57:31,520
You got it was soup if you had something better he wouldn't be using an obviously fake

2132
01:57:31,776 --> 01:57:32,800
Year-old Reddit post

2133
01:57:33,056 --> 01:57:33,568
How to make a

2134
01:57:37,664 --> 01:57:39,712
The different women some of them didn't want to get abortion

2135
01:57:39,968 --> 01:57:44,832
Impact in this weird diatribe

2136
01:57:49,184 --> 01:57:49,696
Stupidity of

2137
01:57:50,720 --> 01:57:52,000
If if that was a thing

2138
01:57:53,024 --> 01:57:53,536
And it was

2139
01:57:54,048 --> 01:57:55,840
In the way that Paul Joseph Watson

2140
01:57:56,608 --> 01:57:57,376
Not as a

2141
01:57:59,424 --> 01:58:00,448
Horrible trauma

2142
01:58:00,704 --> 01:58:01,216
For this woman

2143
01:58:01,472 --> 01:58:02,752
For this woman

2144
01:58:03,008 --> 01:58:09,152
I don't know it I don't know even gets into that

2145
01:58:09,664 --> 01:58:10,944
In the park

2146
01:58:11,200 --> 01:58:14,272
Let's Plays he doesn't even get into that it's all just this Reddit

2147
01:58:14,784 --> 01:58:17,088
So

2148
01:58:18,624 --> 01:58:20,928
Is there anyway where that is

2149
01:58:21,184 --> 01:58:24,000
It's all new story a Planned Parenthood employee

2150
01:58:24,512 --> 01:58:25,024
Steve

2151
01:58:25,280 --> 01:58:27,328
Same woman every month or whatever

2152
01:58:27,584 --> 01:58:28,608
Of course

2153
01:58:29,120 --> 01:58:32,192
That would be national news that you might have bronchitis

2154
01:58:32,448 --> 01:58:33,216
Oh you mean

2155
01:58:33,472 --> 01:58:39,104
Like other people that would absolutely talk to

2156
01:58:39,360 --> 01:58:39,872
Some journalist

2157
01:58:40,384 --> 01:58:42,688
We see you Louisa every 3

2158
01:58:43,456 --> 01:58:44,224
Does every 6 months

2159
01:58:45,504 --> 01:58:47,808
I'm saying it's been going on for 30 years

2160
01:58:48,064 --> 01:58:50,112
I don't know I just really just Gracie

2161
01:58:50,368 --> 01:58:50,880
.

2162
01:58:51,136 --> 01:58:52,672
And also

2163
01:58:52,928 --> 01:58:54,208
F****** hilarious

2164
01:58:54,720 --> 01:58:55,744
Paul Joseph Watson

2165
01:58:56,000 --> 01:59:02,144
All the f****** time talk about Heather the real news

2166
01:59:02,656 --> 01:59:05,984
And Alex's big pageant that he's putting on for this 911 abortions

2167
01:59:06,240 --> 01:59:06,752
Spectacular

2168
01:59:07,008 --> 01:59:09,824
The centerpiece of it is Paul Joseph Watson

2169
01:59:10,080 --> 01:59:11,872
50 primary source of

2170
01:59:12,384 --> 01:59:14,944
For his argument that there is this new fetish

2171
01:59:15,200 --> 01:59:17,504
It's coming around

2172
01:59:18,016 --> 01:59:20,832
It's clearly fake s*** that's a year old on Reddit

2173
01:59:21,088 --> 01:59:21,600
Yeah

2174
01:59:23,392 --> 01:59:24,672
It didn't even do this

2175
01:59:24,928 --> 01:59:31,072
Second of looking into this

2176
01:59:31,328 --> 01:59:33,120
Doing the world

2177
01:59:33,376 --> 01:59:38,496
Nonsensical Post-it back I don't know I don't know if I can use this

2178
01:59:38,752 --> 01:59:41,568
What you do is you go looking for the store you want

2179
01:59:41,824 --> 01:59:42,848
And when you find anything

2180
01:59:43,104 --> 01:59:44,384
Piece of evidence

2181
01:59:44,640 --> 01:59:45,664
Stop

2182
01:59:45,920 --> 01:59:46,432
Looking

2183
01:59:47,200 --> 01:59:48,736
You found it

2184
01:59:48,992 --> 01:59:50,528
That's fair enough

2185
01:59:51,296 --> 01:59:53,856
You always know he's

2186
01:59:55,136 --> 01:59:59,744
Intentionality

2187
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:00,512
Yes

2188
02:00:01,024 --> 02:00:03,584
Yeah he is he's far more like

2189
02:00:04,096 --> 02:00:04,864
Malevolent

2190
02:00:05,888 --> 02:00:08,448
Peace of this abortion

2191
02:00:08,704 --> 02:00:09,984
Unspectacular that Alex puts on

2192
02:00:10,240 --> 02:00:13,312
The new story about it

2193
02:00:24,576 --> 02:00:26,112
Abortion procedure

2194
02:00:32,000 --> 02:00:32,768
Really

2195
02:00:33,536 --> 02:00:35,840
Doctor

2196
02:00:36,864 --> 02:00:37,632
So what

2197
02:00:38,144 --> 02:00:44,288
Circulating in the right-wing media right now because of Jill Stanek recently spoke

2198
02:00:44,544 --> 02:00:46,080
In defense of the born alive

2199
02:00:46,592 --> 02:00:49,664
In her words

2200
02:00:49,920 --> 02:00:51,200
Fielder campaign to get rid of women's

2201
02:00:52,224 --> 02:00:56,576
She described these Comfort rooms are pregnancies has been terminated usually due to complications

2202
02:00:56,832 --> 02:01:00,672
Genetic conditions that would would leave the child unable to survive should have been

2203
02:01:00,928 --> 02:01:04,000
P*** came out technically alive but not viable

2204
02:01:05,536 --> 02:01:08,608
What's interesting to me is at these articles about Stannis,

2205
02:01:11,424 --> 02:01:15,008
This incident prompted Stanek to enter employment at Christ Hospital

2206
02:01:15,520 --> 02:01:18,848
Which obviously gives you the impression that you saw something horrible

2207
02:01:19,104 --> 02:01:21,664
Because you couldn't be around it that's not true

2208
02:01:21,920 --> 02:01:27,808
Christ hospital after she allegedly took pictures and areas that completely violated Payson

2209
02:01:28,064 --> 02:01:28,576
Privacy

2210
02:01:28,832 --> 02:01:31,136
And then quote misrepresented the hospital until

2211
02:01:31,904 --> 02:01:33,696
She was fired by the hospital in

2212
02:01:33,952 --> 02:01:34,976
2001

2213
02:01:35,232 --> 02:01:41,376
Two years after she began making public statements about these Comfort rooms

2214
02:01:41,632 --> 02:01:44,192
You made recently or literally the exact same thing she said

2215
02:01:44,448 --> 02:01:46,496
20 years ago there isn't anything new

2216
02:01:47,776 --> 02:01:49,312
I probably sound a bit

2217
02:01:49,568 --> 02:01:55,712
Flip it but that's probably because her comments kicked off a little bit of the Illinois Department of Public Health ended up doing

2218
02:01:56,224 --> 02:01:57,248
Navigation

2219
02:01:57,504 --> 02:02:00,064
And felt there was no wrongdoing on the part of the hospital

2220
02:02:00,832 --> 02:02:02,112
She's someone who made a fantastic

2221
02:02:02,368 --> 02:02:02,880
Medical claim

2222
02:02:03,136 --> 02:02:03,904
20 years ago

2223
02:02:04,160 --> 02:02:05,696
And all these guys are looking to

2224
02:02:05,952 --> 02:02:06,720
Inaccurate

2225
02:02:07,232 --> 02:02:11,072
She was fired by the hospital on the merits then she started working for WorldNetDaily

2226
02:02:11,328 --> 02:02:14,400
I'm not sure this is a source that I signed to have much credibility

2227
02:02:14,656 --> 02:02:18,240
By Alex does of course because it works into what he wants to present

2228
02:02:18,496 --> 02:02:21,312
This is like 20 year olds

2229
02:02:24,128 --> 02:02:26,432
I wonder which doctor they

2230
02:02:26,688 --> 02:02:27,200
Cortisone

2231
02:02:27,456 --> 02:02:27,968
A story saying

2232
02:02:28,736 --> 02:02:31,808
Well just looked out

2233
02:02:32,064 --> 02:02:32,576
Is all her

2234
02:02:32,832 --> 02:02:33,856
Yeah that's a surprise

2235
02:02:34,112 --> 02:02:35,136
Scout I don't surprise

2236
02:02:35,904 --> 02:02:38,464
Hear that in in

2237
02:02:38,720 --> 02:02:42,048
In the context of talking about this article about Jill Stanek

2238
02:02:42,560 --> 02:02:43,584
Comment

2239
02:02:45,632 --> 02:02:46,912
Talked about 20 years ago

2240
02:02:47,424 --> 02:02:48,960
There's a real

2241
02:02:49,984 --> 02:02:51,264
Cruelty and brutality

2242
02:02:51,520 --> 02:02:52,288
To what Alex

2243
02:02:52,800 --> 02:02:54,592
Is expressing towards the parent

2244
02:02:54,848 --> 02:02:55,872
The would-be parents

2245
02:02:58,688 --> 02:02:59,712
Crosses a line that is

2246
02:03:00,224 --> 02:03:00,736
Unbelievable

2247
02:03:05,088 --> 02:03:06,112
This time

2248
02:03:06,880 --> 02:03:08,416
Oh my God

2249
02:03:16,352 --> 02:03:18,144
For the first photo machine

2250
02:03:19,680 --> 02:03:20,704
Other aboard

2251
02:03:24,800 --> 02:03:25,824
Did you hear that

2252
02:03:28,128 --> 02:03:32,736
Complete with the first photo machine

2253
02:03:33,504 --> 02:03:35,808
Supplies

2254
02:03:36,064 --> 02:03:37,088
Footprint

2255
02:03:39,648 --> 02:03:40,928
Rocking chair

2256
02:03:41,184 --> 02:03:41,952
Cuz you didn't want it

2257
02:03:43,232 --> 02:03:47,584
Creeping death

2258
02:03:48,864 --> 02:03:49,888
That's really disgusting

2259
02:03:50,144 --> 02:03:56,288
Alex's imagine getting photos with their babies

2260
02:03:56,544 --> 02:03:59,104
Fish

2261
02:04:02,944 --> 02:04:09,088
Yeah I wonder if he thinks their Lost Child

2262
02:04:09,344 --> 02:04:10,624
This decision very seriously

2263
02:04:11,136 --> 02:04:12,416
I'm making an emotionally difficult

2264
02:04:12,672 --> 02:04:16,256
Choice does legitimately think that anyone would do this s*** for fun

2265
02:04:16,512 --> 02:04:20,096
What part of Greece

2266
02:04:20,608 --> 02:04:23,168
It's morning and honoring a child you never had

2267
02:04:23,680 --> 02:04:26,240
There's a long history of this sort of thing cross-culturally

2268
02:04:26,496 --> 02:04:30,336
In a religious studies class I took in College reading a book called

2269
02:04:30,592 --> 02:04:31,104
Fetus

2270
02:04:31,360 --> 02:04:35,968
About rituals some people in Taiwan would carry out to provide food and care

2271
02:04:38,016 --> 02:04:38,528
The fetus ghost

2272
02:04:39,296 --> 02:04:43,648
In Japan it's not uncommon to hold the Mizzou cocuyo ceremony

2273
02:04:43,904 --> 02:04:48,000
Honor and recognize the spirits of children lost a miscarriage stillbirth and abortion

2274
02:04:48,512 --> 02:04:52,864
These are not historically uncommon things because people need to process emotionally resonant occasion

2275
02:04:53,376 --> 02:04:54,656
But even if you're making good decisions

2276
02:04:54,912 --> 02:04:55,680
To terminate a pregnancy

2277
02:04:55,936 --> 02:04:57,472
That doesn't automatically mean it's

2278
02:04:57,728 --> 02:04:58,496
Not going to affect you

2279
02:04:59,264 --> 02:05:00,800
I'm sure that's not always the case

2280
02:05:01,056 --> 02:05:03,872
And some people don't have emotionally Paxil experience

2281
02:05:04,128 --> 02:05:04,896
Terminating a pregnancy

2282
02:05:05,408 --> 02:05:08,992
But I find the idea that of Alex mocking the idea of people grieving

2283
02:05:09,504 --> 02:05:10,784
To be so f******

2284
02:05:11,040 --> 02:05:11,552
Disgusting

2285
02:05:11,808 --> 02:05:14,624
They're literally proved to everything he believes about abortion

2286
02:05:14,880 --> 02:05:17,696
Namely the people are always going around getting them for fun

2287
02:05:17,952 --> 02:05:18,464
Complete bulshit

2288
02:05:18,976 --> 02:05:21,024
Because he can't wrestle with that he has thumakda

2289
02:05:21,536 --> 02:05:22,816
And act like it's the most insane

2290
02:05:23,072 --> 02:05:27,168
When in reality it's his callous position that is in Spanish

2291
02:05:28,448 --> 02:05:29,472
This is gross

2292
02:05:31,008 --> 02:05:31,776
Genuinely thinks

2293
02:05:32,032 --> 02:05:32,544
People are

2294
02:05:32,800 --> 02:05:33,312
Getting

2295
02:05:33,568 --> 02:05:34,080
Footprint

2296
02:05:35,360 --> 02:05:36,896
Nonviable fetus

2297
02:05:38,432 --> 02:05:39,456
The same way that

2298
02:05:39,712 --> 02:05:40,224
You get US map

2299
02:05:43,552 --> 02:05:44,320
That's what he

2300
02:05:44,576 --> 02:05:45,088
Because of you

2301
02:05:45,344 --> 02:05:45,856
Gross

2302
02:05:46,368 --> 02:05:46,880
Grosso

2303
02:05:47,392 --> 02:05:48,160
Yeah

2304
02:05:49,952 --> 02:05:52,000
They are article

2305
02:05:52,256 --> 02:05:54,816
Just like really ruminates in the light

2306
02:05:55,840 --> 02:05:56,352
Details

2307
02:05:57,376 --> 02:05:59,168
And when he gets to the end of reading this article

2308
02:05:59,680 --> 02:06:00,448
Do you say something

2309
02:06:01,472 --> 02:06:02,240
Like made me

2310
02:06:03,008 --> 02:06:04,032
My heart flutter a lil

2311
02:06:07,360 --> 02:06:08,128
My day

2312
02:06:12,224 --> 02:06:12,736
Hollywood

2313
02:06:12,992 --> 02:06:14,016
Looking for myself

2314
02:06:14,272 --> 02:06:16,576
We're going to take this country back

2315
02:06:17,088 --> 02:06:18,112
Children

2316
02:06:19,136 --> 02:06:21,440
DuQuoin legally and lawfully

2317
02:06:23,488 --> 02:06:24,768
What day will die

2318
02:06:26,048 --> 02:06:30,656
That is so f***** up

2319
02:06:30,912 --> 02:06:31,936
Music Choice was not income

2320
02:06:32,960 --> 02:06:33,472
That was

2321
02:06:33,728 --> 02:06:35,776
Haunting

2322
02:06:36,800 --> 02:06:39,360
Right on

2323
02:06:39,616 --> 02:06:40,128
Yeah yeah

2324
02:06:41,664 --> 02:06:42,176
So

2325
02:06:42,432 --> 02:06:44,480
I imagine that would Alex's

2326
02:06:44,736 --> 02:06:45,504
Describing is a faint

2327
02:06:46,016 --> 02:06:46,784
Mario where

2328
02:06:47,808 --> 02:06:50,624
I got Trump is in power forever and they outlawed abortion

2329
02:06:50,880 --> 02:06:52,416
Kill everyone who works at

2330
02:06:53,184 --> 02:06:53,696
Yeah

2331
02:06:53,952 --> 02:06:58,304
Anybody who has decided to get divorced because he's repented

2332
02:06:58,816 --> 02:07:00,096
He repented

2333
02:07:02,400 --> 02:07:03,424
The people whom he wants

2334
02:07:04,192 --> 02:07:04,960
Will not have a

2335
02:07:10,080 --> 02:07:10,592
Macy's

2336
02:07:10,848 --> 02:07:11,360
Frazee

2337
02:07:11,616 --> 02:07:12,640
Unlikely

2338
02:07:14,176 --> 02:07:15,200
S*** right there

2339
02:07:15,968 --> 02:07:19,296
Is not politically being opposed to women's rights

2340
02:07:19,552 --> 02:07:21,088
Choose

2341
02:07:22,112 --> 02:07:27,232
I mean we're going to legally

2342
02:07:27,488 --> 02:07:28,000
Excuse you

2343
02:07:28,256 --> 02:07:29,280
This is

2344
02:07:30,048 --> 02:07:32,096
Encouraging violence towards people

2345
02:07:32,352 --> 02:07:33,888
Who work at abortion clinics

2346
02:07:34,144 --> 02:07:36,192
Who are Planned Parenthood employees

2347
02:07:36,448 --> 02:07:37,472
Or people who

2348
02:07:37,728 --> 02:07:38,240
Advocate

2349
02:07:38,496 --> 02:07:39,264
For Women's Health

2350
02:07:39,776 --> 02:07:40,544
This is

2351
02:07:41,312 --> 02:07:42,336
Sincerely

2352
02:07:43,616 --> 02:07:45,408
One of them like most dangerous

2353
02:07:45,664 --> 02:07:48,480
Ways he could be acting 911

2354
02:07:49,760 --> 02:07:50,528
What are you doing

2355
02:07:51,040 --> 02:07:52,320
Is commemorating

2356
02:07:52,576 --> 02:07:53,344
The memory

2357
02:07:55,904 --> 02:07:56,416
Terrorist

2358
02:07:56,928 --> 02:07:58,464
Who inspired him to try

2359
02:07:58,976 --> 02:07:59,488
Can kill others

2360
02:08:01,536 --> 02:08:04,608
Cause 9/11

2361
02:08:04,864 --> 02:08:11,008
That I got through the newest episode

2362
02:08:11,520 --> 02:08:13,568
To prop up his abortion argue

2363
02:08:14,336 --> 02:08:15,872
Just makes it clear

2364
02:08:21,504 --> 02:08:27,648
60 million + abortions in the United States like real one

2365
02:08:30,976 --> 02:08:33,024
Divide 3000

2366
02:08:37,376 --> 02:08:40,192
White a mini

2367
02:08:40,448 --> 02:08:43,776
Goddamn this guy built his career on 911

2368
02:08:46,592 --> 02:08:52,224
He's very flippant about 911 this is not what I expected from him on 9/11

2369
02:08:52,480 --> 02:08:52,992
911

2370
02:08:53,504 --> 02:08:54,016
Not that big

2371
02:08:54,528 --> 02:08:55,296
Happy 9/11

2372
02:08:56,320 --> 02:08:57,088
Strange

2373
02:08:57,344 --> 02:09:00,672
He gets into talking about abortion doctor

2374
02:09:01,184 --> 02:09:02,464
Also it's more insane

2375
02:09:02,976 --> 02:09:04,000
It's more insane because

2376
02:09:04,256 --> 02:09:05,536
You could argue that

2377
02:09:06,304 --> 02:09:07,072
911

2378
02:09:07,328 --> 02:09:07,840
Was

2379
02:09:08,352 --> 02:09:09,120
The single

2380
02:09:09,376 --> 02:09:09,888
It was like

2381
02:09:11,168 --> 02:09:11,936
Flashpoint

2382
02:09:12,192 --> 02:09:13,472
Led to America

2383
02:09:13,728 --> 02:09:14,240
Cannibalized

2384
02:09:15,008 --> 02:09:16,544
Over the past 20 years

2385
02:09:16,800 --> 02:09:18,080
You could argue that

2386
02:09:18,336 --> 02:09:19,104
911

2387
02:09:20,128 --> 02:09:22,688
Is going to take down the entire United

2388
02:09:23,200 --> 02:09:25,760
Their word hasn't already

2389
02:09:26,016 --> 02:09:28,576
I don't know if you could draw a straight line

2390
02:09:28,832 --> 02:09:31,392
But I think you could make an argument that a lot of the ripple effect

2391
02:09:33,184 --> 02:09:33,696
That have led to the

2392
02:09:33,952 --> 02:09:34,976
The state we're in now

2393
02:09:35,232 --> 02:09:36,512
Yeah

2394
02:09:36,768 --> 02:09:38,560
Abortion

2395
02:09:43,168 --> 02:09:46,496
Are they are they are they

2396
02:09:46,752 --> 02:09:49,568
Probably middle management

2397
02:09:49,824 --> 02:09:51,616
Plumber so Alex's video of it

2398
02:09:51,872 --> 02:09:53,152
But he won't play it

2399
02:10:04,672 --> 02:10:05,184
Do it

2400
02:10:07,232 --> 02:10:12,608
Abortion clinics

2401
02:10:18,240 --> 02:10:21,568
I thought they loved it

2402
02:10:36,160 --> 02:10:36,672
He don't

2403
02:10:37,696 --> 02:10:39,488
Do you have it but it's not convincing

2404
02:10:42,304 --> 02:10:43,328
You got to see it

2405
02:10:46,656 --> 02:10:51,520
Because what he's doing is abortion clinic still see their demon

2406
02:10:52,032 --> 02:10:54,336
Yeah we will execute them

2407
02:10:54,592 --> 02:10:55,104
At some point

2408
02:10:56,128 --> 02:10:57,408
He makes it even more over

2409
02:11:06,880 --> 02:11:09,184
You know Jesus is real

2410
02:11:09,952 --> 02:11:10,976
What's really bad

2411
02:11:19,936 --> 02:11:22,240
Abortion clinics

2412
02:11:24,032 --> 02:11:26,592
So what we have is a show

2413
02:11:26,848 --> 02:11:28,384
Calling for violence

2414
02:11:28,896 --> 02:11:31,712
Whether it's pretend legal and lawful violence or not

2415
02:11:31,968 --> 02:11:33,504
Is calling for the Deaf

2416
02:11:33,760 --> 02:11:36,576
Of these people who are involved literal

2417
02:11:36,832 --> 02:11:37,856
Yeah

2418
02:11:38,112 --> 02:11:39,648
He's enlisting his audience

2419
02:11:39,904 --> 02:11:41,440
To go to abortion clinic

2420
02:11:41,696 --> 02:11:45,024
He's literally saying go today and see the demons

2421
02:11:45,536 --> 02:11:47,840
What did he expect some of his audience to do

2422
02:11:48,096 --> 02:11:49,376
When they see demons

2423
02:11:51,168 --> 02:11:52,960
No weed

2424
02:11:53,472 --> 02:11:53,984
No

2425
02:11:54,240 --> 02:11:55,520
From history that

2426
02:11:56,288 --> 02:11:57,056
Abortion protest

2427
02:11:59,104 --> 02:11:59,872
Is always very

2428
02:12:00,896 --> 02:12:01,664
Call

2429
02:12:02,176 --> 02:12:03,456
Respect

2430
02:12:03,968 --> 02:12:04,736
No one

2431
02:12:04,992 --> 02:12:05,504
It has

2432
02:12:05,760 --> 02:12:06,528
I don't know

2433
02:12:06,784 --> 02:12:07,552
Summit abortion

2434
02:12:07,808 --> 02:12:08,832
Doctor in the head

2435
02:12:09,088 --> 02:12:11,904
No never happened nobody's bombed Arleta

2436
02:12:12,160 --> 02:12:12,672
An abortion clinic

2437
02:12:12,928 --> 02:12:13,696
Bonfire

2438
02:12:13,952 --> 02:12:16,768
I'm not saying that like this is going

2439
02:12:17,024 --> 02:12:17,536
To cause that

2440
02:12:18,048 --> 02:12:19,328
But it's Behavior

2441
02:12:20,864 --> 02:12:22,656
Is trying to get that to have

2442
02:12:23,424 --> 02:12:25,472
This is there is no other way

2443
02:12:25,728 --> 02:12:27,264
This doesn't advance

2444
02:12:27,520 --> 02:12:28,544
Your discourse

2445
02:12:28,800 --> 02:12:31,360
This doesn't Advance the point you're trying to make

2446
02:12:31,616 --> 02:12:32,128
This exists

2447
02:12:33,152 --> 02:12:34,176
To Hope

2448
02:12:34,432 --> 02:12:36,480
One of your listeners goes and shoots up in divorce

2449
02:12:36,736 --> 02:12:39,808
There's literally no other way to operate like this

2450
02:12:40,064 --> 02:12:41,344
This is unacceptable

2451
02:12:41,600 --> 02:12:42,112
2

2452
02:12:42,368 --> 02:12:45,696
Levels that I can't even really describe and this is purposeful

2453
02:12:46,208 --> 02:12:47,232
Not

2454
02:12:47,488 --> 02:12:49,536
Continue sucking juice

2455
02:12:50,304 --> 02:12:51,072
Johnson

2456
02:12:51,328 --> 02:12:52,352
Give a f*** about this

2457
02:12:52,864 --> 02:12:55,424
He doesn't think that this is really doesn't he doesn't

2458
02:12:55,680 --> 02:12:56,192
Care about it

2459
02:12:56,704 --> 02:12:58,496
It doesn't matter and yet on 9/11

2460
02:13:00,032 --> 02:13:00,544
NetSpend

2461
02:13:00,800 --> 02:13:01,568
Fire show

2462
02:13:03,872 --> 02:13:05,408
So you'll pay attention to him

2463
02:13:08,224 --> 02:13:08,992
Fox up

2464
02:13:11,296 --> 02:13:11,808
And that is

2465
02:13:12,064 --> 02:13:12,576
Money

2466
02:13:13,088 --> 02:13:13,600
Wow

2467
02:13:14,368 --> 02:13:15,136
It might be past that

2468
02:13:15,904 --> 02:13:16,416
Oh no

2469
02:13:16,928 --> 02:13:18,208
This is one of the

2470
02:13:18,464 --> 02:13:20,512
We're already pretty deep into this episode

2471
02:13:20,768 --> 02:13:23,840
And there was a large part of me that as I was listening to the 10th I was like

2472
02:13:24,352 --> 02:13:24,864
Well

2473
02:13:25,120 --> 02:13:28,448
That's probably an episode

2474
02:13:28,704 --> 02:13:32,032
I heard that Paul Joseph Watson report

2475
02:13:32,544 --> 02:13:34,080
I heard how disgusting you was I

2476
02:13:34,592 --> 02:13:35,104
Heard this

2477
02:13:35,360 --> 02:13:36,640
Call for his audience

2478
02:13:36,896 --> 02:13:38,944
Go to abortion clinics to

2479
02:13:39,200 --> 02:13:39,712
For themselves

2480
02:13:40,224 --> 02:13:43,040
I was like that's f****** like that I can't leave alone

2481
02:13:44,064 --> 02:13:44,576
And then this

2482
02:13:45,344 --> 02:13:46,624
And I was like well

2483
02:13:48,416 --> 02:13:48,928
Is huge

2484
02:13:49,952 --> 02:13:52,256
Hollywood is complete

2485
02:14:05,312 --> 02:14:08,128
Tonight the dishes, the time to go ahead and just be

2486
02:14:11,712 --> 02:14:13,760
And it's really hard to

2487
02:14:18,624 --> 02:14:19,904
A lot of

2488
02:14:23,488 --> 02:14:24,768
Different ways

2489
02:14:25,792 --> 02:14:27,840
I can basically

2490
02:14:31,424 --> 02:14:32,192
To describe it

2491
02:14:40,384 --> 02:14:42,176
Talk about the future of Infowars

2492
02:14:49,600 --> 02:14:50,624
So I heard that

2493
02:14:53,440 --> 02:14:55,488
I have a lot of work

2494
02:14:55,744 --> 02:14:59,584
I have conflicting feelings about it at all

2495
02:15:01,632 --> 02:15:02,912
A feeling of sincerity

2496
02:15:03,168 --> 02:15:06,496
Be a difficulty talking about

2497
02:15:07,264 --> 02:15:09,312
Are you struggling with words

2498
02:15:10,336 --> 02:15:15,968
It feels like whether or not he's exaggerating something definitely something behind

2499
02:15:16,736 --> 02:15:19,808
Some existential fear that he has about like

2500
02:15:20,320 --> 02:15:21,088
Can't really do any

2501
02:15:22,112 --> 02:15:24,672
So when he comes back he doesn't he's not bluffing

2502
02:15:28,000 --> 02:15:29,792
Do you make some very specific

2503
02:15:30,304 --> 02:15:30,816
Frame

2504
02:15:33,376 --> 02:15:35,936
But might be sincere might not

2505
02:15:36,192 --> 02:15:36,704
I don't know

2506
02:15:37,216 --> 02:15:40,032
Free for March

2507
02:15:40,288 --> 02:15:42,080
Finish Line

2508
02:15:46,176 --> 02:15:47,456
Selling product

2509
02:16:00,768 --> 02:16:01,536
Filipino money

2510
02:16:22,272 --> 02:16:25,344
For just merchants

2511
02:16:28,160 --> 02:16:29,696
24-hour security up here

2512
02:16:34,560 --> 02:16:36,864
You're the one who chose to hire Blackwater

2513
02:16:38,656 --> 02:16:40,704
I don't know what to think about

2514
02:16:41,728 --> 02:16:44,288
Conflicted because it is definitely an

2515
02:16:44,544 --> 02:16:45,056
With a trans

2516
02:16:46,592 --> 02:16:52,480
Constantly talks about wanting to quit wanted to be a farmer s*** like that

2517
02:16:52,992 --> 02:16:55,040
Checked out

2518
02:16:55,808 --> 02:16:56,832
His legal fees

2519
02:16:57,088 --> 02:16:58,112
Gotta be exorbitant

2520
02:16:58,368 --> 02:16:59,648
Like there's no way

2521
02:17:00,160 --> 02:17:00,672
Keep up with

2522
02:17:01,184 --> 02:17:03,488
Like just all of the expensive

2523
02:17:03,744 --> 02:17:04,256
Stop

2524
02:17:04,768 --> 02:17:05,280
Toby heard

2525
02:17:06,048 --> 02:17:11,424
I don't know it was a couple weeks ago maybe he's talking about having to have a decision about whether or not to order more product

2526
02:17:11,936 --> 02:17:12,448
And this time

2527
02:17:12,704 --> 02:17:13,216
Specifically

2528
02:17:14,240 --> 02:17:15,776
It does sound like that

2529
02:17:16,032 --> 02:17:18,336
I don't know I don't know if he's being clear enough

2530
02:17:18,848 --> 02:17:19,872
Really to say like

2531
02:17:20,128 --> 02:17:24,992
What you saying is there are not ordering any more product

2532
02:17:25,248 --> 02:17:26,528
It sounds like he's given up

2533
02:17:27,040 --> 02:17:29,088
Yeah it does sound like that

2534
02:17:29,344 --> 02:17:29,856
306

2535
02:17:30,112 --> 02:17:30,624
55 days

2536
02:17:31,136 --> 02:17:31,904
Is a long

2537
02:17:32,416 --> 02:17:33,440
Year where you

2538
02:17:33,696 --> 02:17:34,464
Can order product

2539
02:17:34,976 --> 02:17:35,488
Any one of those

2540
02:17:36,768 --> 02:17:37,536
Yeah

2541
02:17:37,792 --> 02:17:39,840
Yeah it was literally like

2542
02:17:40,352 --> 02:17:42,656
After a month

2543
02:17:42,912 --> 02:17:43,680
His fans go

2544
02:17:44,192 --> 02:17:44,704
Shadonna is

2545
02:17:45,216 --> 02:17:51,360
You know what everybody loves this so much we're going to reorder is that

2546
02:17:51,616 --> 02:17:54,688
Why has a marathon diminishing returns to

2547
02:17:54,944 --> 02:17:59,040
I have to assume that that's part of the calculation that they say

2548
02:17:59,552 --> 02:18:00,576
Is like okay yes

2549
02:18:01,088 --> 02:18:04,672
This amount of money that you can get from selling all the stuff in the warehouse

2550
02:18:04,928 --> 02:18:07,744
Will get you so far but

2551
02:18:08,000 --> 02:18:13,888
Because you don't have the money now to reorder you have the money for either

2552
02:18:14,144 --> 02:18:15,168
You can do one of them

2553
02:18:15,680 --> 02:18:16,704
So basically

2554
02:18:16,960 --> 02:18:18,496
He's in a position where let's a cost

2555
02:18:19,008 --> 02:18:24,128
$5000000 to run the operation free gear and also cost $5 to order the product

2556
02:18:24,384 --> 02:18:30,528
He could spend $10 now for the product and hope that more sales will come

2557
02:18:30,784 --> 02:18:31,808
He's running on nothing

2558
02:18:32,320 --> 02:18:34,112
For the the show and

2559
02:18:34,368 --> 02:18:38,208
He is all that other legal

2560
02:18:38,976 --> 02:18:40,256
Or you could

2561
02:18:40,512 --> 02:18:44,096
Afford that $5000000 to run free year

2562
02:18:44,352 --> 02:18:45,888
At that point he has nothing left

2563
02:18:46,400 --> 02:18:49,472
In order to reorder supplies

2564
02:18:49,728 --> 02:18:53,056
That I see it is kind of being

2565
02:18:53,312 --> 02:18:54,080
Where

2566
02:18:54,336 --> 02:18:54,848
He's at

2567
02:18:55,104 --> 02:18:57,408
I don't know if that's accurate he could be full of s*** but

2568
02:18:57,920 --> 02:19:01,504
Well if I've not heard him speak this specifically

2569
02:19:01,760 --> 02:19:02,528
Morosely

2570
02:19:02,784 --> 02:19:04,576
Yeah it does it does sound

2571
02:19:05,600 --> 02:19:06,112
Real

2572
02:19:12,000 --> 02:19:13,536
That I goes back to I think

2573
02:19:16,608 --> 02:19:17,120
For money

2574
02:19:17,888 --> 02:19:18,400
He doesn't

2575
02:19:18,656 --> 02:19:19,168
Need it and

2576
02:19:20,448 --> 02:19:20,960
So

2577
02:19:21,472 --> 02:19:22,752
It's totally fine with

2578
02:19:23,264 --> 02:19:23,776
He's a narcissist

2579
02:19:26,080 --> 02:19:27,872
But now that he actually needs it

2580
02:19:28,384 --> 02:19:29,152
And he's coming from

2581
02:19:29,408 --> 02:19:29,920
Replaceable

2582
02:19:30,688 --> 02:19:31,200
That's why he

2583
02:19:31,456 --> 02:19:31,968
So resist

2584
02:19:32,480 --> 02:19:32,992
To talk about it

2585
02:19:33,248 --> 02:19:34,272
And and

2586
02:19:36,576 --> 02:19:37,344
Possibility

2587
02:19:37,600 --> 02:19:38,624
Pretty strong possibility

2588
02:19:39,392 --> 02:19:43,232
I think there's also a part of it that's like expectation building

2589
02:19:43,488 --> 02:19:44,000
Rosati's

2590
02:19:44,256 --> 02:19:46,304
Psyqui tiered probably suck

2591
02:19:46,560 --> 02:19:48,352
We don't want to disappear overnight

2592
02:19:48,608 --> 02:19:50,144
Yeah you should I have

2593
02:19:50,400 --> 02:19:53,984
Emotionally f***** you guys all up real bad

2594
02:19:54,240 --> 02:19:55,008
Comfify

2595
02:19:55,264 --> 02:19:58,080
Disappeared out of nowhere

2596
02:19:58,336 --> 02:20:00,384
Swan song where I ruined it

2597
02:20:00,640 --> 02:20:02,944
Tire NBA franchise for a year

2598
02:20:03,200 --> 02:20:04,480
And then we'll figure it

2599
02:20:04,992 --> 02:20:09,600
We talked more about in this just feels like you saying

2600
02:20:09,856 --> 02:20:11,392
Anymore

2601
02:20:12,416 --> 02:20:14,720
I don't want to sit here

2602
02:20:20,096 --> 02:20:21,632
I'm just going to tell this Thursday

2603
02:20:23,424 --> 02:20:26,240
I'm not going to dolphins back I'm going to a bunch of people off

2604
02:20:27,264 --> 02:20:29,312
I'm just going to go 170 election

2605
02:20:33,408 --> 02:20:34,944
On the front

2606
02:20:35,712 --> 02:20:36,992
Americana

2607
02:20:37,248 --> 02:20:39,040
Disposable

2608
02:20:39,296 --> 02:20:40,320
Populism worldwide

2609
02:20:40,832 --> 02:20:42,368
Just fizzle out

2610
02:20:42,624 --> 02:20:43,392
Trout year

2611
02:20:43,648 --> 02:20:44,672
I'm going to go out with a B

2612
02:20:46,976 --> 02:20:47,488
Bros

2613
02:20:47,744 --> 02:20:49,536
But also a year isn't going to get you

2614
02:20:50,816 --> 02:20:51,584
Point of order

2615
02:20:52,096 --> 02:20:52,608
Yeah

2616
02:21:03,616 --> 02:21:06,176
Wonderful

2617
02:21:09,760 --> 02:21:12,832
Product

2618
02:21:13,344 --> 02:21:15,648
Operation

2619
02:21:16,672 --> 02:21:17,440
Do you understand

2620
02:21:17,952 --> 02:21:19,744
Fuel

2621
02:21:40,736 --> 02:21:41,504
I'm On Target

2622
02:21:42,016 --> 02:21:44,832
Because we're going into Crossroads

2623
02:21:47,904 --> 02:21:48,928
27 years

2624
02:21:59,424 --> 02:22:03,008
See that's why I don't necessarily believe this it goes right to an ad

2625
02:22:03,264 --> 02:22:03,776
Right there

2626
02:22:04,032 --> 02:22:10,176
I still think he has some sort of semblance of a hope that he can pull this one off

2627
02:22:11,712 --> 02:22:12,992
Feel good.

2628
02:22:15,296 --> 02:22:16,576
I kind of sounds like he's

2629
02:22:16,832 --> 02:22:18,112
Is directly appealing to

2630
02:22:18,368 --> 02:22:18,880
Republican

2631
02:22:20,672 --> 02:22:24,256
Please I'm going to go all-in for Trump in the election

2632
02:22:24,768 --> 02:22:25,280
Trump

2633
02:22:25,792 --> 02:22:26,304
Please

2634
02:22:27,584 --> 02:22:28,608
Please give me your

2635
02:22:37,824 --> 02:22:39,872
News

2636
02:22:40,128 --> 02:22:42,688
Really mad at the people who are giving him money because he

2637
02:22:42,944 --> 02:22:43,968
Like on the six

2638
02:22:44,480 --> 02:22:45,504
Even before that

2639
02:22:45,760 --> 02:22:46,272
He's aware of

2640
02:22:47,552 --> 02:22:48,320
He knows that he's

2641
02:22:48,576 --> 02:22:51,648
Living in a situation where he's got to figure out something

2642
02:22:52,672 --> 02:22:54,720
And all of these really rich people

2643
02:22:54,976 --> 02:22:57,536
Give Pam lip service or whatever

2644
02:22:57,792 --> 02:23:03,936
Exist

2645
02:23:04,192 --> 02:23:05,216
The only way you're going to

2646
02:23:05,472 --> 02:23:10,080
Find like a billionaire donor is probably

2647
02:23:10,336 --> 02:23:12,384
Yeah like that's that's

2648
02:23:14,176 --> 02:23:16,992
I think the patron that was

2649
02:23:17,248 --> 02:23:20,576
Explicitly interested in a tangle of discovery

2650
02:23:20,832 --> 02:23:24,160
And I don't I don't think that they would pay top dollar for him

2651
02:23:24,416 --> 02:23:30,560
I don't I don't think I would be able to operate

2652
02:23:30,816 --> 02:23:32,608
Even some kind of a benefactor

2653
02:23:33,120 --> 02:23:34,912
He just doesn't have the utility

2654
02:23:36,704 --> 02:23:37,216
Anymore

2655
02:23:37,984 --> 02:23:39,520
It's kind of sad

2656
02:23:39,776 --> 02:23:41,056
It's kind of sad because I think

2657
02:23:41,568 --> 02:23:43,104
I think he's living in the space

2658
02:23:43,360 --> 02:23:44,384
It feels to me Italy

2659
02:23:44,896 --> 02:23:45,664
That he's like

2660
02:23:45,920 --> 02:23:47,712
I still got a good season in me

2661
02:23:47,968 --> 02:23:49,760
I still I'm relevant

2662
02:23:50,016 --> 02:23:53,600
And all evidence is to the contrary that like you have

2663
02:23:53,856 --> 02:23:55,648
You have played out your career

2664
02:23:56,160 --> 02:23:56,672
This is

2665
02:23:57,184 --> 02:23:57,696
This is it

2666
02:23:58,976 --> 02:23:59,744
I don't know

2667
02:24:00,000 --> 02:24:04,608
Tickets going on like you simultaneously giving up

2668
02:24:04,864 --> 02:24:07,168
Still trying to be like I need money

2669
02:24:07,680 --> 02:24:08,704
Which is weird

2670
02:24:08,960 --> 02:24:10,752
Embodied

2671
02:24:12,032 --> 02:24:18,176
We got in the position

2672
02:24:28,160 --> 02:24:30,208
We've been a self-funded media operations done

2673
02:24:35,328 --> 02:24:36,608
You found it

2674
02:24:53,248 --> 02:24:54,784
What's a billion

2675
02:24:58,112 --> 02:25:00,928
Over 100 million dollars you have

2676
02:25:15,008 --> 02:25:17,568
Think that's a bad reference

2677
02:25:21,920 --> 02:25:24,992
They were happy forever

2678
02:25:26,272 --> 02:25:28,320
I don't know I don't know what to make

2679
02:25:28,576 --> 02:25:29,600
To see how things play out

2680
02:25:29,856 --> 02:25:31,904
Cuz you such a liar

2681
02:25:32,160 --> 02:25:33,696
Especially around bunnies

2682
02:25:33,952 --> 02:25:34,464
Stop

2683
02:25:34,720 --> 02:25:36,256
Like this is such a perfect

2684
02:25:36,512 --> 02:25:39,584
For him to do in order for people to

2685
02:25:39,840 --> 02:25:40,864
The cover it and be like

2686
02:25:41,120 --> 02:25:47,264
Alex is going out of business and they don't come back better than ever

2687
02:25:47,520 --> 02:25:53,664
That possible

2688
02:25:53,920 --> 02:25:59,296
You want this to keep calling you

2689
02:25:59,552 --> 02:26:04,160
Sell these great products for cheap

2690
02:26:04,416 --> 02:26:06,976
But there is a manipulative is making it the audience's

2691
02:26:07,232 --> 02:26:09,280
His fault that he's going to go out

2692
02:26:09,536 --> 02:26:13,376
It is which could just be a ploy to get them to buy more

2693
02:26:13,888 --> 02:26:17,216
I don't know I've never heard him talk like that

2694
02:26:18,240 --> 02:26:19,520
Prettymuchit

2695
02:26:19,776 --> 02:26:20,544
That I'm delighted

2696
02:26:23,872 --> 02:26:26,176
Man I can't imagine being a new hire

2697
02:26:26,432 --> 02:26:28,480
Arthur's

2698
02:26:28,736 --> 02:26:34,368
Yeah the one who went to other

2699
02:26:34,624 --> 02:26:40,256
Probably gone by now if I work there

2700
02:26:40,512 --> 02:26:44,096
If I were working at it for that I heard Alex talking like this on Eric

2701
02:26:44,352 --> 02:26:47,680
Oh yeah

2702
02:26:52,800 --> 02:26:55,104
I was unemployed for years

2703
02:26:55,360 --> 02:26:59,712
Find myself

2704
02:26:59,968 --> 02:27:01,760
I was in Tibet

2705
02:27:03,296 --> 02:27:05,088
If this is

2706
02:27:07,648 --> 02:27:08,160
People be

2707
02:27:08,416 --> 02:27:10,464
End up seeing it out

2708
02:27:10,720 --> 02:27:11,232
Flow

2709
02:27:11,488 --> 02:27:12,512
Of employees

2710
02:27:16,352 --> 02:27:17,120
I'm cautious

2711
02:27:17,376 --> 02:27:18,656
Yeah I'm cautious about this

2712
02:27:19,936 --> 02:27:22,240
His mobile

2713
02:27:27,360 --> 02:27:28,128
He talked about the

2714
02:27:28,896 --> 02:27:29,920
I really just talked about white

2715
02:27:30,176 --> 02:27:34,016
It's kind of cleared

2716
02:27:34,272 --> 02:27:36,576
What what did you do

2717
02:27:44,000 --> 02:27:49,120
Unreal wow so Alex

2718
02:27:50,400 --> 02:27:52,448
It's just so racist

2719
02:28:06,528 --> 02:28:07,296
And that's it

2720
02:28:07,808 --> 02:28:13,952
It's very clear the West End

2721
02:28:14,208 --> 02:28:19,840
I got his phone turned on it started broadcasting

2722
02:28:22,400 --> 02:28:23,680
So that's pretty

2723
02:28:24,192 --> 02:28:26,496
Yeah

2724
02:28:26,752 --> 02:28:27,264
That

2725
02:28:27,520 --> 02:28:28,544
The wife is the West

2726
02:28:28,800 --> 02:28:29,312
Jesus

2727
02:28:29,568 --> 02:28:31,616
Rice

2728
02:28:31,872 --> 02:28:34,432
On Who is the

2729
02:28:34,688 --> 02:28:38,272
Right guy the man whose name could not be

2730
02:28:38,528 --> 02:28:39,552
Liar man

2731
02:28:39,808 --> 02:28:43,904
Little bit about

2732
02:28:44,160 --> 02:28:44,672
Complaints

2733
02:28:44,928 --> 02:28:45,952
About that manual

2734
02:28:46,208 --> 02:28:46,720
Mccrone

2735
02:28:48,768 --> 02:28:50,304
Just a little bit white National

2736
02:28:50,560 --> 02:28:53,632
A little bit little bit

2737
02:28:53,888 --> 02:28:54,912
Yes

2738
02:28:59,520 --> 02:29:02,336
Okay well there's feces everywhere and homeless people

2739
02:29:07,968 --> 02:29:10,016
Why the hell would they be doing that

2740
02:29:13,856 --> 02:29:16,416
In cities like Paris Stockholm London

2741
02:29:16,672 --> 02:29:21,024
And tourism is popped in other countries where things are much safer and where there aren't that many migrants

2742
02:29:21,280 --> 02:29:24,864
Cities like Dubrovnik Croatia Split Croatia a crocodile

2743
02:29:25,120 --> 02:29:29,472
These places are at

2744
02:29:29,984 --> 02:29:33,824
The cities are more beautiful they're cleaner they're safer

2745
02:29:35,616 --> 02:29:38,944
Everyone I know is

2746
02:29:39,200 --> 02:29:43,552
Selection bias there

2747
02:29:43,808 --> 02:29:45,344
Twisting macrons words

2748
02:29:45,600 --> 02:29:48,928
Just a little bit from what I can tell he said that Africa is the continent

2749
02:29:49,696 --> 02:29:51,488
Which is a little different from what

2750
02:29:52,256 --> 02:29:53,792
It also makes sense for French president

2751
02:29:54,048 --> 02:29:58,912
To say something like this because a large portion of Africa was part of what's known as lamole francophone

2752
02:29:59,424 --> 02:30:00,192
Or the front speaker

2753
02:30:00,448 --> 02:30:00,960
World

2754
02:30:01,216 --> 02:30:03,264
Places like Cote de voir

2755
02:30:03,520 --> 02:30:07,104
There's 18 other African countries were France French as the official language

2756
02:30:07,872 --> 02:30:09,152
Hey it's a small Point compared to

2757
02:30:09,664 --> 02:30:10,432
Far more

2758
02:30:11,968 --> 02:30:14,784
The things that Alex and Dan Lyman or saying here are not

2759
02:30:15,040 --> 02:30:15,552
True

2760
02:30:16,064 --> 02:30:20,416
According to the local out of France April 2019

2761
02:30:20,672 --> 02:30:21,184
History quotes

2762
02:30:21,440 --> 02:30:24,000
Francis just enjoyed a record year for visitor

2763
02:30:25,792 --> 02:30:28,608
The record without 80%

2764
02:30:28,864 --> 02:30:35,008
Paris draws in over 30 million tourists a year which makes sense given its large number of monuments and attractions Owen

2765
02:30:35,264 --> 02:30:36,544
The f****** Disneyland

2766
02:30:38,336 --> 02:30:39,104
The Francis variant

2767
02:30:39,360 --> 02:30:40,384
Climate so you can go to

2768
02:30:40,640 --> 02:30:42,176
You can do

2769
02:30:42,432 --> 02:30:43,968
Ski slope they got everything

2770
02:30:44,224 --> 02:30:50,112
The very appealing country to visit unless all you do is listen to Infowars

2771
02:30:50,624 --> 02:30:53,696
Connection France article from August 28th

2772
02:30:53,952 --> 02:30:57,024
Disgusting alfrancis World in tourism

2773
02:30:57,280 --> 02:31:03,168
There's some truth that terrorism took a little bit of a dip in 2015 in the wake of those two high-profile terrorist

2774
02:31:03,424 --> 02:31:07,520
Attack right but that was just a temporary setback in the tourism

2775
02:31:07,776 --> 02:31:08,288
For now

2776
02:31:08,800 --> 02:31:13,664
The Eukarya seems like different tourism numbers something around 3% this year compared to last year

2777
02:31:13,920 --> 02:31:16,224
But there's no reason to say that immigrants

2778
02:31:16,480 --> 02:31:17,504
That number is low

2779
02:31:17,760 --> 02:31:21,088
If you ask tourism organization to visit Britain

2780
02:31:22,880 --> 02:31:23,904
As they told the independent

2781
02:31:24,416 --> 02:31:27,744
Quote we've seen a Slowdown from Europe with our research showing

2782
02:31:28,000 --> 02:31:30,304
The impact of the uncertainty of brexit

2783
02:31:30,560 --> 02:31:32,608
Is having visitors from the EU

2784
02:31:33,120 --> 02:31:36,448
Storms of the

2785
02:31:37,472 --> 02:31:39,008
Incompetent

2786
02:31:39,264 --> 02:31:40,288
Sand

2787
02:31:40,800 --> 02:31:43,616
Pure evil of brexit has made people not want to

2788
02:31:46,688 --> 02:31:52,064
That doesn't sound particularly place where their tourism numbers are down in visitors from other EU countries

2789
02:31:55,392 --> 02:31:56,160
It's causing that

2790
02:31:56,672 --> 02:31:57,696
Is that accurate

2791
02:31:57,952 --> 02:32:04,096
I don't know but I think probably trust the director of a British tourism board on British tourism-related issues over Alex

2792
02:32:04,608 --> 02:32:05,376
Talkingshit

2793
02:32:06,144 --> 02:32:07,424
As for sweet

2794
02:32:07,680 --> 02:32:09,984
Stockholm I'll call you from the local quote

2795
02:32:10,240 --> 02:32:12,032
Tristan Sweden spent 370

2796
02:32:12,288 --> 02:32:14,336
Billion kronor in 2017

2797
02:32:14,592 --> 02:32:17,408
Enough to make it to top year for tourism of all time

2798
02:32:18,944 --> 02:32:20,480
But that was just a

2799
02:32:20,736 --> 02:32:23,808
You people owe 100 million

2800
02:32:26,112 --> 02:32:30,464
Nope according to macro-trends is part of an upward trend

2801
02:32:30,720 --> 02:32:32,768
12.89% increase

2802
02:32:33,024 --> 02:32:34,304
27

2803
02:32:34,560 --> 02:32:36,608
Continue that Trend with an 11.29

2804
02:32:36,864 --> 02:32:37,376
Anchor

2805
02:32:37,888 --> 02:32:38,400
In numbers

2806
02:32:40,960 --> 02:32:47,104
Feelings

2807
02:32:50,432 --> 02:32:55,552
How many immigrants are in them

2808
02:32:55,808 --> 02:32:57,088
Which is undeniably race

2809
02:32:58,624 --> 02:33:02,464
You can tell that by the examples that Dan list of cities where tourism is up

2810
02:33:02,976 --> 02:33:09,120
Poland doesn't example that white nationalist to use all the time

2811
02:33:10,144 --> 02:33:10,912
Declare yourself away

2812
02:33:14,752 --> 02:33:17,312
Set the destination to gets brought up by people in that

2813
02:33:17,568 --> 02:33:22,176
Sector about how great a country

2814
02:33:22,432 --> 02:33:23,968
They don't allow anybody

2815
02:33:24,224 --> 02:33:25,504
Croatia

2816
02:33:27,296 --> 02:33:31,648
2019 article in total Croatia news

2817
02:33:32,160 --> 02:33:38,304
Quote after several years of growth at unrealistically high rates caused by external factors the Croatian tourist season

2818
02:33:38,560 --> 02:33:41,632
2019 has so far seen a slight stagnation and decline

2819
02:33:42,400 --> 02:33:45,216
We have to prepare ourselves well for these new circumstances

2820
02:33:45,472 --> 02:33:47,776
Be prepared to fight for each and every guest

2821
02:33:48,032 --> 02:33:49,824
Said Franco Palmer the Croatian

2822
02:33:50,080 --> 02:33:51,360
Chamber of Commerce

2823
02:33:55,968 --> 02:34:00,832
It's just make abundantly clear that Dan is not having a conversation based on reality

2824
02:34:01,600 --> 02:34:05,952
Like maybe a friend of his recently what does that grab and had a really good time there

2825
02:34:06,208 --> 02:34:11,328
Because he knows the Croatia as a largely homogeneous population with relatively few not brown people

2826
02:34:11,840 --> 02:34:12,352
Who knows

2827
02:34:13,120 --> 02:34:13,888
Oh yeah

2828
02:34:14,656 --> 02:34:15,424
Who knows

2829
02:34:16,192 --> 02:34:20,032
The argument these guys are trying to make an immigrant a trust

2830
02:34:20,288 --> 02:34:22,080
France Sweden in UK tourism

2831
02:34:22,336 --> 02:34:26,176
In places like Poland Croatia are on the rise because

2832
02:34:26,944 --> 02:34:29,504
They're further asserting that the people in charge

2833
02:34:33,088 --> 02:34:34,880
A reason probably because they wanted

2834
02:34:35,136 --> 02:34:35,648
The cross the Torah

2835
02:34:36,672 --> 02:34:37,184
The economy

2836
02:34:38,464 --> 02:34:40,000
Look at the numbers

2837
02:34:40,256 --> 02:34:44,864
It's easy to see the both of these arguments are based on anything other than

2838
02:34:45,376 --> 02:34:46,656
Namely that they hate

2839
02:34:48,192 --> 02:34:48,704
I don't

2840
02:34:49,984 --> 02:34:50,496
It's fine with her

2841
02:34:51,008 --> 02:34:51,520
It's not fine

2842
02:34:52,288 --> 02:34:52,800
It's awful

2843
02:34:53,568 --> 02:34:54,080
Straight up lie

2844
02:34:54,336 --> 02:34:55,104
Write what

2845
02:34:55,616 --> 02:34:56,640
Sting's the most

2846
02:34:57,152 --> 02:34:59,456
Because I feel like it's a microcosm of that

2847
02:34:59,968 --> 02:35:00,480
National

2848
02:35:02,528 --> 02:35:03,040
Is when

2849
02:35:03,296 --> 02:35:04,064
They say things

2850
02:35:04,320 --> 02:35:04,832
Things that are not

2851
02:35:06,112 --> 02:35:06,624
But

2852
02:35:07,136 --> 02:35:08,160
Demonstrable

2853
02:35:08,416 --> 02:35:08,928
The office

2854
02:35:09,440 --> 02:35:13,024
Could you just lie about

2855
02:35:13,280 --> 02:35:13,792
Like

2856
02:35:14,048 --> 02:35:14,816
Jordan eats

2857
02:35:16,096 --> 02:35:17,120
Spaghetti sauce every morning

2858
02:35:19,168 --> 02:35:20,448
Find you made that up

2859
02:35:20,704 --> 02:35:24,032
But if I ate the opposite of spaghetti sauce every morning

2860
02:35:24,288 --> 02:35:28,896
Yourself into a real hole or something

2861
02:35:29,408 --> 02:35:32,224
Before careful

2862
02:35:36,832 --> 02:35:38,880
The same thing is always true with with

2863
02:35:39,392 --> 02:35:39,904
Brexit

2864
02:35:40,416 --> 02:35:42,464
Like that

2865
02:35:42,720 --> 02:35:43,488
10 million dollars

2866
02:35:46,304 --> 02:35:46,816
Apple Health System

2867
02:35:47,072 --> 02:35:48,352
And then they do the numbers and with x

2868
02:35:49,888 --> 02:35:51,424
Stick it wind up losing 10 million

2869
02:35:53,472 --> 02:35:53,984
Just

2870
02:35:54,240 --> 02:35:55,264
Applying fake

2871
02:35:55,776 --> 02:35:59,360
Don't say the opposite we can't actually live in nice

2872
02:35:59,616 --> 02:36:03,712
1584

2873
02:36:03,968 --> 02:36:08,320
Two are just completely absorbed within this year's

2874
02:36:08,576 --> 02:36:10,624
Where their perceptions about

2875
02:36:10,880 --> 02:36:11,392
These countries are

2876
02:36:11,648 --> 02:36:12,416
Completely

2877
02:36:12,672 --> 02:36:13,696
Molded by the

2878
02:36:13,952 --> 02:36:15,232
Sensational Videos

2879
02:36:15,744 --> 02:36:17,536
Post-dated taken out of context

2880
02:36:17,792 --> 02:36:20,096
And reporting for people like Paul Joseph Watson

2881
02:36:20,352 --> 02:36:22,144
Year-old Reddit post

2882
02:36:22,656 --> 02:36:25,472
Artist Community College

2883
02:36:25,728 --> 02:36:26,496
So they're already

2884
02:36:27,008 --> 02:36:27,520
That

2885
02:36:27,776 --> 02:36:28,288
Audience

2886
02:36:28,544 --> 02:36:29,824
So when you talk like this

2887
02:36:30,080 --> 02:36:31,616
You can lie about whatever the f*** you want

2888
02:36:31,872 --> 02:36:33,152
And it's better for you to

2889
02:36:33,408 --> 02:36:33,920
How to use your feeling

2890
02:36:34,176 --> 02:36:36,736
Paris

2891
02:36:38,528 --> 02:36:39,808
Literal

2892
02:36:40,064 --> 02:36:40,576
F******

2893
02:36:41,088 --> 02:36:43,904
Budget crisis for France

2894
02:36:44,160 --> 02:36:47,488
All we would read all day France burning

2895
02:36:47,744 --> 02:36:48,512
Like it

2896
02:36:49,024 --> 02:36:53,376
And I understand a lot of the numbers I was looking at were France

2897
02:36:53,888 --> 02:36:54,912
As opposed to Paris

2898
02:36:55,168 --> 02:36:56,192
But you got understand

2899
02:36:56,448 --> 02:36:57,216
Most of the tourism

2900
02:36:57,472 --> 02:36:59,776
80%

2901
02:37:00,032 --> 02:37:00,544
The country would be

2902
02:37:02,336 --> 02:37:04,896
Numbers would be down

2903
02:37:05,152 --> 02:37:06,176
So hard

2904
02:37:06,432 --> 02:37:07,712
London

2905
02:37:07,968 --> 02:37:09,248
Hertz.com

2906
02:37:12,320 --> 02:37:15,648
Make up the majority of

2907
02:37:16,160 --> 02:37:18,720
Travel affected

2908
02:37:18,976 --> 02:37:20,256
In any meaningful way

2909
02:37:20,512 --> 02:37:23,072
The country could not possibly be setting a record

2910
02:37:23,840 --> 02:37:25,376
Tourism

2911
02:37:26,912 --> 02:37:27,424
That's

2912
02:37:27,680 --> 02:37:28,192
Kind of

2913
02:37:28,448 --> 02:37:28,960
What's so funny

2914
02:37:29,728 --> 02:37:32,544
It is

2915
02:37:32,800 --> 02:37:33,568
Because I have to reference

2916
02:37:34,336 --> 02:37:34,848
84

2917
02:37:35,104 --> 02:37:38,176
And that cliche because we're actually living it

2918
02:37:38,432 --> 02:37:39,200
And we're living

2919
02:37:40,480 --> 02:37:40,992
Boring

2920
02:37:42,016 --> 02:37:43,040
It is a little bit

2921
02:37:46,368 --> 02:37:47,648
Immigrant

2922
02:37:55,840 --> 02:37:59,936
Commissioner for refugees report for 2015

2923
02:38:03,264 --> 02:38:05,568
But Alex is still being completely unfair

2924
02:38:06,336 --> 02:38:08,128
Majority of the refugees except

2925
02:38:08,384 --> 02:38:09,408
Did China from Vietnam

2926
02:38:09,664 --> 02:38:12,736
However that year they also let in 182 Somalian

2927
02:38:12,992 --> 02:38:14,016
86 Nigerian

2928
02:38:14,528 --> 02:38:15,296
52 Iraq

2929
02:38:15,552 --> 02:38:16,832
45 Liberian

2930
02:38:17,344 --> 02:38:18,112
On 306

2931
02:38:18,368 --> 02:38:18,880
52 people

2932
02:38:19,136 --> 02:38:20,160
From unspecified cont

2933
02:38:20,928 --> 02:38:22,208
These numbers are very low

2934
02:38:26,048 --> 02:38:26,560
That is a lie

2935
02:38:27,328 --> 02:38:30,400
I know Alex is really pushing hard for Trump to have an immigration policy

2936
02:38:30,912 --> 02:38:31,424
Top Fin

2937
02:38:31,680 --> 02:38:33,216
Is designed to let's say quotes

2938
02:38:33,472 --> 02:38:37,312
Promote economic development in National Security while maintaining social

2939
02:38:37,568 --> 02:38:38,080
Stability

2940
02:38:38,336 --> 02:38:39,360
Do you avoid

2941
02:38:39,616 --> 02:38:40,640
Really sounds like

2942
02:38:41,664 --> 02:38:42,432
Words for what you

2943
02:38:44,992 --> 02:38:45,504
Keep white people

2944
02:38:47,296 --> 02:38:49,344
What's the weather

2945
02:38:49,600 --> 02:38:51,136
Government

2946
02:38:51,392 --> 02:38:51,904
Multi-position on it

2947
02:38:52,160 --> 02:38:52,928
Immigration

2948
02:38:53,440 --> 02:38:59,584
It's really super ironic

2949
02:38:59,840 --> 02:39:00,864
To be more like them

2950
02:39:01,376 --> 02:39:03,680
When I hear him say the China doesn't like

2951
02:39:03,936 --> 02:39:05,728
Easy to hear him saying that

2952
02:39:05,984 --> 02:39:07,520
He thinks it's bad that they talk

2953
02:39:07,776 --> 02:39:11,872
In reality it's a baby throwing a tantrum so China can do it why can't we

2954
02:39:12,384 --> 02:39:13,664
That's when you say that

2955
02:39:13,920 --> 02:39:14,432
Exactly what he

2956
02:39:14,944 --> 02:39:16,736
Yeah you would you hear it

2957
02:39:16,992 --> 02:39:17,760
And you're a human

2958
02:39:18,016 --> 02:39:18,528
Cigarette lighter

2959
02:39:19,552 --> 02:39:20,320
We all agree

2960
02:39:21,088 --> 02:39:21,600
Accepting refugees

2961
02:39:22,368 --> 02:39:25,696
It's a good thing

2962
02:39:25,952 --> 02:39:29,792
That's not what I said

2963
02:39:31,584 --> 02:39:32,608
Other people

2964
02:39:32,864 --> 02:39:33,888
They don't let people in

2965
02:39:34,144 --> 02:39:35,424
Probably

2966
02:39:37,216 --> 02:39:38,496
Why can't I

2967
02:39:39,008 --> 02:39:40,032
So I get the bad news

2968
02:39:41,824 --> 02:39:47,968
Things in a forest without accidentally leaving my phone onto everybody knows how racist or not realizing someone walked up

2969
02:39:57,696 --> 02:40:03,072
He upgraded

2970
02:40:06,912 --> 02:40:08,448
Baltimore Barn checks

2971
02:40:10,752 --> 02:40:11,776
So does donkey

2972
02:40:12,544 --> 02:40:13,568
100

2973
02:40:13,824 --> 02:40:16,896
I don't give a f*** about the butt

2974
02:40:17,408 --> 02:40:17,920
I do have one

2975
02:40:19,456 --> 02:40:19,968
Because

2976
02:40:20,480 --> 02:40:23,552
It's a piece of information about our

2977
02:40:24,064 --> 02:40:26,112
You know hearing Alex giving up

2978
02:40:26,368 --> 02:40:28,672
Yeah

2979
02:40:28,928 --> 02:40:29,952
Weird

2980
02:40:30,208 --> 02:40:30,976
So now

2981
02:40:31,488 --> 02:40:32,512
He enlist Barn

2982
02:40:33,024 --> 02:40:33,792
To do an adverb

2983
02:40:55,552 --> 02:40:57,088
Recently confirmed

2984
02:41:09,888 --> 02:41:14,496
Between

2985
02:41:18,080 --> 02:41:24,224
Back between dinner and a late snack

2986
02:41:30,624 --> 02:41:34,464
Medicine

2987
02:41:34,720 --> 02:41:40,864
You are weird unaffected by a wide range of thing

2988
02:41:41,120 --> 02:41:42,912
Over the years

2989
02:41:58,016 --> 02:42:04,160
Bora

2990
02:42:04,416 --> 02:42:09,024
Was because of work

2991
02:42:09,280 --> 02:42:15,424
Weather

2992
02:42:32,320 --> 02:42:35,392
I only got people cuz I was on

2993
02:42:35,648 --> 02:42:39,232
Stimulants

2994
02:42:39,488 --> 02:42:44,352
Holyshit Dallas's product

2995
02:42:44,608 --> 02:42:50,752
That I took back when I was in college I've never found anything

2996
02:42:51,008 --> 02:42:57,152
For rainforest

2997
02:42:57,408 --> 02:43:03,296
Unbecoming as hell for a lawyer understand how he didn't have his law license revoked after reading

2998
02:43:03,808 --> 02:43:04,320
Various

2999
02:43:04,576 --> 02:43:05,088
Insane

3000
02:43:05,600 --> 02:43:07,136
Mercedes not reading it

3001
02:43:07,392 --> 02:43:08,160
This is extemporaneous

3002
02:43:08,416 --> 02:43:10,720
I believe

3003
02:43:11,744 --> 02:43:12,768
One he is good

3004
02:43:13,024 --> 02:43:14,816
If he's making that up off the top of his head

3005
02:43:21,728 --> 02:43:26,080
Late night snack

3006
02:43:26,336 --> 02:43:26,848
That's true

3007
02:43:29,152 --> 02:43:29,664
Is it okay

3008
02:43:30,688 --> 02:43:32,480
Actress Lola

3009
02:43:32,736 --> 02:43:35,296
The crimes you committed to become a lawyer and I'm not

3010
02:43:38,112 --> 02:43:44,256
Ripon College

3011
02:43:44,512 --> 02:43:45,792
I did

3012
02:43:46,048 --> 02:43:47,328
Speed drugs in college

3013
02:43:47,584 --> 02:43:49,376
And now frame forces just like it

3014
02:43:49,632 --> 02:43:52,192
That's a very weird way to solve it

3015
02:43:52,448 --> 02:43:53,472
Product

3016
02:43:57,056 --> 02:44:00,896
I understand that

3017
02:44:01,920 --> 02:44:04,480
It's almost as good as speakers

3018
02:44:04,736 --> 02:44:05,760
Not having

3019
02:44:06,272 --> 02:44:07,296
The single moment

3020
02:44:07,552 --> 02:44:08,320
Of clarity

3021
02:44:08,576 --> 02:44:09,600
That you should have had which

3022
02:44:10,880 --> 02:44:11,392
Turns out

3023
02:44:11,904 --> 02:44:12,416
I was take

3024
02:44:13,440 --> 02:44:14,208
That I didn't know what was

3025
02:44:14,464 --> 02:44:14,976
Inside of it

3026
02:44:15,232 --> 02:44:15,744
And it was

3027
02:44:17,536 --> 02:44:18,048
And I looked

3028
02:44:20,608 --> 02:44:21,120
Which

3029
02:44:21,376 --> 02:44:22,400
I don't know what to

3030
02:44:22,656 --> 02:44:25,984
Makes me feel exactly like those pills

3031
02:44:26,240 --> 02:44:28,032
That I didn't know what was inside of them

3032
02:44:28,288 --> 02:44:33,408
Speed it also puts into question like that pressured speech

3033
02:44:33,664 --> 02:44:35,712
Like amphetamines

3034
02:44:35,968 --> 02:44:42,112
Or some byproduct of his chemistry and brain Force together

3035
02:44:42,624 --> 02:44:45,696
Apparently

3036
02:44:47,488 --> 02:44:48,000
Tidewater

3037
02:44:48,256 --> 02:44:50,304
Scam lawyer

3038
02:44:50,560 --> 02:44:56,704
Scam lawyers there Amarillo

3039
02:44:58,496 --> 02:45:01,568
Yeah you know all those booty coffee shops that serve

3040
02:45:01,824 --> 02:45:03,104
Infowars coffee

3041
02:45:03,360 --> 02:45:04,384
Highest and

3042
02:45:04,640 --> 02:45:05,152

Artisanal roast

3046
02:45:15,392 --> 02:45:15,904
Coffee

3047
02:45:16,416 --> 02:45:16,928
But it's ludicrous

3048
02:45:17,184 --> 02:45:20,768
To think that in the conversation of these coffees

3049
02:45:21,024 --> 02:45:23,072
Infowars wakeupamerica blend

3050
02:45:23,840 --> 02:45:24,864
Ridiculous

3051
02:45:25,376 --> 02:45:27,168
Wow what they do is

3052
02:45:27,424 --> 02:45:28,960
Personally goes to

3053
02:45:29,728 --> 02:45:31,008
South America.

3054
02:45:31,520 --> 02:45:34,592
Coffee beans

3055
02:45:34,848 --> 02:45:36,640
If ever there's an argument for like

3056
02:45:36,896 --> 02:45:38,688
Him not being allowed to be a lawyer

3057
02:45:43,040 --> 02:45:44,576
Yeah just

3058
02:45:45,088 --> 02:45:46,624
You're lying

3059
02:45:46,880 --> 02:45:47,648
Do people dab

3060
02:45:48,928 --> 02:45:51,488
11th episode

3061
02:45:51,744 --> 02:45:56,608
7:49

3062
02:45:57,120 --> 02:46:01,984
Please play the clip of trump being interviewed on TV

3063
02:46:02,240 --> 02:46:08,383
Mysteriously

3064
02:46:11,967 --> 02:46:13,247
Because that shows how great the

3065
02:46:13,759 --> 02:46:17,599
And I want to bring that part of the interview at

3066
02:46:18,111 --> 02:46:18,623
Play the conversation

3067
02:46:18,879 --> 02:46:21,439
Because it makes the mantown solace

3068
02:46:21,695 --> 02:46:22,207
Like

3069
02:46:22,719 --> 02:46:24,255
Psychopath who should be kept

3070
02:46:24,511 --> 02:46:25,279
Just far away from the rest of

3071
02:46:25,535 --> 02:46:26,047
The human race

3072
02:46:29,119 --> 02:46:33,215
Well I don't care about the little bit that Alex talked about 911 because

3073
02:46:33,727 --> 02:46:37,311
It's kind of a standard bulshit you always here to talk about

3074
02:46:38,079 --> 02:46:38,591
2

3075
02:46:40,639 --> 02:46:41,407
Specific of stupid

3076
02:46:43,199 --> 02:46:44,735
What is

3077
02:46:45,247 --> 02:46:46,783
Someone trying to sound like an egg

3078
02:46:47,039 --> 02:46:48,319
Expert but who's forgotten

3079
02:46:48,575 --> 02:46:51,903
All of his curriculum done

3080
02:46:52,159 --> 02:46:55,999
911 s*** in a long time.

3081
02:46:56,255 --> 02:46:57,279
He's dusting off the old man

3082
02:46:57,535 --> 02:46:58,047
Material in a dozen

3083
02:46:59,071 --> 02:46:59,839
He doesn't have the chops

3084
02:47:00,095 --> 02:47:01,631
Dino's produce loose change

3085
02:47:01,887 --> 02:47:04,191
You probably remember some of the stuff at that

3086
02:47:04,447 --> 02:47:05,471
Bye

3087
02:47:06,239 --> 02:47:07,775
It's not worth while it's really kind

3088
02:47:12,639 --> 02:47:13,151
The takeaway of the

3089
02:47:15,455 --> 02:47:17,759
This clip perfectly describes

3090
02:47:18,271 --> 02:47:19,807
I think he's describing it

3091
02:47:20,063 --> 02:47:20,575
As a wave

3092
02:47:20,831 --> 02:47:21,343
People look at

3093
02:47:22,111 --> 02:47:24,671
Is

3094
02:47:40,799 --> 02:47:43,103
Protection of all the other stuff

3095
02:47:43,359 --> 02:47:45,919
Stupid

3096
02:47:50,015 --> 02:47:50,783
Enough to sit

3097
02:47:51,039 --> 02:47:51,807
With the adults

3098
02:47:52,063 --> 02:47:53,087
Also shut up

3099
02:47:53,343 --> 02:47:54,367
None of that stuff is happening

3100
02:47:54,879 --> 02:48:01,023
He would start throwing food at people like you wouldn't be able to have a conversation if he was sitting at the adults table

3101
02:48:01,279 --> 02:48:05,375
You're at the Kids Table Alex

3102
02:48:05,631 --> 02:48:09,215
Right you can't possibly act the way he does

3103
02:48:09,471 --> 02:48:15,615
Like when he was on that BBC show and just as going infowars.com over people to act like

3104
02:48:15,871 --> 02:48:19,455
Publican expected anyone is going

3105
02:48:19,711 --> 02:48:23,551
You got to sit with us

3106
02:48:23,807 --> 02:48:25,599
Coliseum

3107
02:48:25,855 --> 02:48:29,439

02:48:29,695 --> 02:48:35,839
You're very successful

02:48:37,887 --> 02:48:39,935
You're very president

3110
02:48:40,191 --> 02:48:40,703
Sing like a f******

3111
02:48:40,959 --> 02:48:44,031
Very successful at the kids table and I applaud you for it

3112
02:48:44,287 --> 02:48:44,799
But

3113
02:48:45,055 --> 02:48:46,335
You're welcome off that

3114
02:48:50,687 --> 02:48:51,199
You know

3115
02:48:52,735 --> 02:48:53,759
Interesting portrait that we

3116
02:48:54,527 --> 02:48:55,295
I think that

3117
02:48:56,831 --> 02:48:58,367
Game Theory the problem is solving

3118
02:48:59,135 --> 02:48:59,647
They

3119
02:48:59,903 --> 02:49:01,439
Free market of ideas is rejected

3120
02:49:03,487 --> 02:49:04,767
No he would not say that the

3121
02:49:05,023 --> 02:49:05,535
The free market advice

3122
02:49:06,047 --> 02:49:06,559
Has rejected

3123
02:49:06,815 --> 02:49:07,583
Well he's at the kids

3124
02:49:07,839 --> 02:49:09,375
So he can

3125
02:49:09,631 --> 02:49:10,655
Well the problem is

3126
02:49:10,911 --> 02:49:12,191
The Kids Table in everybody added

3127
02:49:13,215 --> 02:49:13,727
Guns pointed at

3128
02:49:13,983 --> 02:49:14,495
The adult table

3129
02:49:17,567 --> 02:49:19,615
It's not a pleasant

3130
02:49:20,639 --> 02:49:24,735
We'll see what happens I'm excited for the possibility of Alex going broke

3131
02:49:26,527 --> 02:49:27,295
Fun

3132
02:49:31,647 --> 02:49:32,671
It would be nice to have

3133
02:49:35,231 --> 02:49:36,255
Schadenfreude

3134
02:49:37,791 --> 02:49:41,119
And the fact that even if Infowars goes under you could still do a podcast

3135
02:49:41,375 --> 02:49:41,887
Black eyed pea soup

3136
02:49:49,055 --> 02:49:50,591
Dynamic

3137
02:49:51,359 --> 02:49:52,639

Are you never do this cuz he couldn't take the money

3139
02:49:56,223 --> 02:49:58,527
It'd be interesting to see what he would do

3140
02:49:59,039 --> 02:49:59,551
If like

3141
02:50:00,063 --> 02:50:01,343
