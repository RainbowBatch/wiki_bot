Bumpers are going to come after you for that it's not like it when people tell people to rumble

13
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:35,232
What's up what's going on

14
00:01:35,488 --> 00:01:37,792
Yeah ever ask you this

15
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:42,656
Show or outside visit make for an interesting question.

17
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:47,520
Do you ever

18
00:01:47,776 --> 00:01:51,104
I don't know if I told you that when I was in church

19
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:03,648
Maybe a little bit

20
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:05,184
Trying anything I could

21
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:09,536
Community there there's no real opportunity

22
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:10,560
Do stand-up all that much

23
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:12,608
Play started my own bar show

24
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:17,472
It went pretty well and then I also tried to get in on the internet

00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:20,288
Little video game

26
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:27,456

00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,320
Do you have anyone that's memorable

Columbia Missouri

31
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:44,352
Sweet had one sketchware

32
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:45,632
The whole premise was it like

33
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:46,400
We are trying to

34
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:47,168
To come up with a nickname

35
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:49,984

36
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,032
Coming up with name

37
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:52,800
Games that were like

38
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:54,848
But denial later Earth

39
00:02:55,104 --> 00:02:57,920
Something bickering

40
00:02:58,176 --> 00:02:59,456
Like there was a whole thing

41
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:00,992
Meet him and Ryan Beck

42
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:01,760
Another comedian

43
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:04,320
Three of us would always get into fights

44
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:08,416
About how I thought the essence of Comedy is arguing

45
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:10,720
People just have a disagreement

46
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:17,120
Either they would disagree with Abby and

47
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:20,192
They didn't destroy that absolutely.

48
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:23,008
So those meetings about

49
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:24,800
Sketches with probably more fun

50
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:26,592
And funnier than the actual sketches

51
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:27,616
Is themselves whatever.

52
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:31,200
It wasn't

53
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:35,296
I can't remember lines that well I'm not really good at improvising

54
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:37,344
I can have a conversation

55
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:42,720
The pressure of like we're in a seeing and I've got to come up with something to ask to

56
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:44,768
Follow the gamer I can't

57
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:50,400
You don't really get into the moment

58
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:51,936
Nope nope

59
00:03:55,264 --> 00:04:01,408
If I were in an improv jet like I've seen a lot of them

60
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:07,808
Am I reaction

61
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:14,976
Like what are you doing the brakes everything

62
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:17,536
Compared to Colin Mochrie like

63
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:22,143
It's stupid and I just stormed off Ryan Ryan trials I've got to go

64
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:25,215
Should not be as compelling television

65
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:31,615
That's right

66
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:33,407
That's the theme of this year's show

67
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:40,063
29th

68
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:42,111
Interesting stuff that goes on

Cepheid infuriate

70
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:51,583
On the 22nd largest

71
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:57,983
Stuff to say about that would infuriate you might have a take on the climate protest

72
00:04:58,239 --> 00:05:01,567
I wonder if it's it's pretty good

73
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:04,383
It's not for somebody that's pretty good

74
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:10,783
Pretty great is how I feel about people who

75
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:12,319
I took a couple of them their Folk

76
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:15,903

81
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:33,311

Today

91
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:20,415
We start on the 23rd

92
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:21,951
And this is really interesting

93
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:26,303
The show with the music that I've never heard him use before

94
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:47,295
Charles Stanley are here

95
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:53,183
Chronicle what's unfolding

96
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:59,583
Three things first of all

Metro

98
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:13,663
Is opening his show with a song by Lana Del Rey

99
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:19,039
After we talked about him not liking her on our last episode

100
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:20,063
They are f******

101
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:26,463
No it could be misconstrued as I like sending subtle messages to us and I were the type of person who likes

102
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:30,559
Text to create false

103
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:34,655
I would probably accept that's the reality of what's going on and I would tell the audience

104
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:39,263
Hey Alex is f****** with us by playing Lana Del Rey

105
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:40,543
Oh no

106
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:41,823
It seems like Alex

107
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:46,687
Really likes Lana Del Rey's new album normanfuckingrockwell

108
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:52,319
I love it great

109
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:58,719
Great I had to look into a little bit because I know he hated her in the past

110
00:07:58,975 --> 00:08:01,279
What are you doing

111
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:03,071
The new album by Lana Del Rey

112
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:08,191
Easy he thinks that she's celebrating Americana

113
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:14,591
I think you might be missing out on some of these subtler artistic elements Atlanta

114
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:19,199
Music critics out there

115
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:20,223
And I found

116
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:22,015
Clip from late August

117
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:24,063
What are the shows that I must not have listened to

118
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:27,647
Episode Alex

119
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:29,439
Goes into howdy

120
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:35,839
Just downloaded the Lana Del Rey album.

121
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:42,239
Beauty in the world that's great reminder

122
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:52,991
At a school

123
00:08:58,879 --> 00:08:59,391

124
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:03,487

126
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:16,543
Real quick that's California

127
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:22,943
Who's gone and moved away out of America and I want to f*** you.

128
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:26,015
Metaphor for America

129
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:30,623

131
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:49,055
It doesn't matter the past

132
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:50,591
Real quick also

133
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:56,991
Wow he's talking about this they flash up on screen the album cover but cuz it's enormous

134
00:10:05,951 --> 00:10:06,719
Divided

135

138
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:20,031
Stop.

139
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:21,567
Oh

140
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:23,103
Go

141
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:38,719

143
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:50,239
I just don't

144
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:51,007
Care about

145
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:00,735
Rockstar

146
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:10,975
Okay here's ago and stuck in Gray

147
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:14,047
It's ridiculous this is ridiculous

148
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:20,447
That's so strange rice pudding

149
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:24,031
I'm going to tell you honestly I cannot go out with you

150
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:24,799
Too busy

151
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:26,079
Fighting the New World Order

152
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:34,271
You know if you refrained the new world order as Alex's bulshit I might have turned down a number of invitation to my license

153
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:41,951
This is really funny

154
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:44,255
Article quotes

155
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:46,303

Trump with witchcraft

157
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:53,983
This was in response to Lana tweeting about using witchcraft to unseat Trump so I guess I can have to give it up to him

158
00:11:54,239 --> 00:12:00,383
Normanfuckingrockwell

159
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:06,015
Cited the sheet music to the version of Americana that he's into

160
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:06,783
Weird

161
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:08,063
41

162
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:10,367
She's been working on that album for a long time

163
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:12,415
She started on it in like 26

164
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:16,255
Recording the songs are on this album

165
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:17,535
In the same time span which

166
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:21,631
You decided to take out Trump with witchcraft and Alex got really serious about it

167
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:22,655
Further

168
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:27,263
Diablo's co-produced by Jack Antonoff who dated Lena Dunham for like 5 years

169
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:29,567
Someone who Alex thinks is a literal demon

170
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:33,407
Does he somehow think that the person who dated a literal demon for a half-decade

171
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:34,687
And a person trying to untie

172
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:38,527
Trump through witchcraft came together and put out a straightforward album glorifying

173
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:40,575
The right-wing fantasies about America

174
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:54,399
I couldn't find a specific article but I also do remember Alex Chabad house

175
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:56,447
Like Lana Del Rey Born To Die album

176
00:12:57,215 --> 00:12:59,263
Celebrating

177
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:08,479
Doesn't matter

178
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:13,599
You got to Blick

Dan

180
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:19,231
It's probably time for me to jump

181
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:25,887
All on a first listen I think it's a great Lana Del Rey album which is to say that it's lousy with dark sarcasm

182
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:29,727
And most of the songs are about f****** dudes you probably shouldn't f***

183
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:32,543
About Lana Del Rey's work usually has dual meeting

184
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:34,591
Involved

185
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:44,063
A complicated

However in an interview with GQ she explained

187
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:49,695

188
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:50,463

189
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:53,791
School at the age of 14 because she was a child alcoholic

190
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:55,839
She also revealed that you almost

191
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:57,375
Exclusively drank alone

192
00:13:57,631 --> 00:14:01,215
Which kind of introduces the thought that a lot of the characters in the songs on that album

193
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:04,543
Might not actually be people but drive is within herself

194
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:07,615
A lot of young does work if you view it as an ironic

195
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:09,919
Take on the vet parody of Show Business

196
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:10,943
Pursuit of wealth

197
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:12,223
I'm over everything else

198
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:14,271
But there are also other things Atlantis

199
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:15,807
Clearly expressed

200
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:18,623
Which one of the things that makes our work particularly interesting

201
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:21,951
Sound that makes

202
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:22,975
Bitingly dark

203
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:23,743
Pop songs

204
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:25,279
They also have layers

205
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:29,119
Obviously she's not the only artist out there you can speak that about but it doesn't really matter

206
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:30,655
Enjoy your work

207
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:33,983
If you disagree think I should be listening to better things

208
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:37,823
I also listen to Carly Rae Jepsen what are we doing

209
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:40,639
What's the point

210
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:45,759
One consistent thing is characterized Lana Del Rey's careers

211
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:46,527
We tell ourselves

212
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:52,927
About our culture's our lives and our country patriotic imagery for ironic

213
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:53,695
Make a fact

214
00:14:53,951 --> 00:14:57,791
Alex Jones because he likes his ability to analyze things

215
00:14:58,047 --> 00:15:01,119
Season American flag and thinks it's up tickets patriotic

216
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:02,143
In effect

217
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:03,935
He is what she's mocking

218
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:07,519
Because because Lana Del Rey makes really good music

219
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:10,079
Even the target of her ridicule is lured into

220
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:11,615
To thinking that she's on their side

221
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:14,687
This is really impressive stuff and it really

222
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:18,015
Delicious piece of stupidity on Alex's bar

223
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:24,671
Like a big glass of water with Juicy ice cubes

224
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:32,607
I do I do really enjoy

225
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:39,007
Unexpected twist first of all that Matt drudge is into normanfuckingrockwell Alex

226
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:42,079
Put out his gal

227
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:42,847
Wow

228
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:44,639
Americana

229
00:15:46,943 --> 00:15:48,223
Really interesting

230
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:50,527
These people can both

231
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:51,295
8 +

232
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:52,063
Glorified

233
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:56,671
What album is

234
00:15:56,927 --> 00:15:59,999
Representative

235
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:02,815
Back in my day we listen

236
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:05,887
What do real spring-trap

237
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:12,287
I wonder what he thinks of

238
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:13,567
Her National lamp

239
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:19,711
I wonder what he thinks Jackie O

240
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:22,783
This idyllic life

241
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:24,319
The children

242
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:28,671
And all this assassination by ASAP Rocky

243
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:29,439
That's

244
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:36,095
At the beginning of this episode is like pretty depressed

245
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:37,119
An ostrich

246
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:39,935
Patel with his like I'm your Alex Jones house

247
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:43,263
That sort of fumbling intro

248
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:46,335
But he's a little bit down

249
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:48,383
And you can hear it as he introduces

250
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:50,431
Special Report he's about

251
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:52,991
How many are 80 Harvey

252
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:55,039
Put some images to

253
00:16:58,111 --> 00:16:59,135
1980s

254
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:00,671
And then we are going to

255
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:01,439
She come back

256
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:02,975
There's just a Vibe of like

257
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:04,767
Just doing it

258
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:06,047
Yeah he's

259
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:07,071
He's not bringing it

260
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:09,375
It's really interesting

261
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:10,143
Cialix

262
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:12,191
Co-opted by Paul Harvey

263
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:18,847
These days when he has a special reports Play It's always one of his employees to put it together that's a johnbowne reporter Millie Weaver

264
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:19,615
Special

265
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:22,943
Three rare frame does it take someone else's material and put images over

266
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:26,015
It makes me wonder John bowne is getting too expensive

267
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:27,551
Prowling around

268
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:30,111
The reason is choices intro

269
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:33,695
Give me though I've never heard Alex talk about Paul Harvey before

270
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:35,999
And he absolutely should have a lot

271
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:39,839
Blueprint for

272
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:40,863
Extra

273
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:41,887
50s on work

274
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:44,959
I'm not nearly as interested in those sides of things

275
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:48,287
Because I think off the beaten path

276
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:49,823
For most conservative

277
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:50,847
Speaking terms of style

278
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:52,383
That being said

279
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:55,455
There is an element in which Alex is the truth

280
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:56,991
Descendant of Paul Harvey

281
00:17:57,247 --> 00:17:59,295
More than anyone else could ever hope to

282
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:00,831
He got drunk a lot on

283
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:02,623
I don't know about that baby

284
00:18:03,135 --> 00:18:06,463
Smith discuss Harvey's careers episode

285
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:07,999
Consider after Harvey

286
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:10,047
Lead singer of The Cure Robert

287
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:11,327
No

288
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:12,607
MPR

289
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:17,983
Familiar

290
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:21,055
Barbie style with unique and always compelling

291
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:22,591
Even when he got to the ads

292
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:27,967
Move into his pitch making it into a story just as riveting as the news around here

293
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:28,991
The product

294
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:31,039
The intensity was the same

295
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:32,319
And for it you would pay dance

296
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:35,647
That sounds familiar a little bit

297
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:41,023
Paul Harvey's ability to make add sound like they're part of his show

298
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:42,559
From that mprp

299
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:44,607
Bruce demott

300
00:18:44,863 --> 00:18:46,399
Broadcast

301
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:47,167
Communication

302
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:49,215
Advertisers love Harvey

303
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:50,495
Well

304
00:18:50,751 --> 00:18:51,519
Because he moved Prada

305
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:53,055
I mean that was the key thing

306
00:18:55,871 --> 00:19:00,735
Answer another article about inform NPR said quote Harvey's voice transition

307
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:04,575
Seamlessly from a Story 2 commentary to a carefully placed advertisement

308
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:06,111
Became a kind of brand

309
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:06,879
Kingmaker

310
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:09,951
People trusted what he was telling until they trusted what he was selling

311
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:15,839
Paul Harvey blurred the line between newscaster and outright salesman in a way that Dumont describes

312
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:17,375
Lesbian quotes very unfair

313
00:19:17,631 --> 00:19:18,399
Feebly Behavior

314
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:20,703
For any other newscaster to engage in

315
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:23,775
A breach of ethics

316
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:28,639
Paul Harvey's careers touched a lot of the right-wing media in ways that often go unnoticed

317
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:32,991
Somewhere stylistic touches a political move

318
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:39,391
Look for Alex Jones Harvey was the king of integrating ads into your show and make them feel the same as the news

319
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:45,279
Is probably very unseemly in the 50s and it sure is unseemly today

320
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:48,607
That's so fun

321
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:50,911
Yeah

322
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:54,495
F****** Morrill stamp

323
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:57,567
What the hell are you talkin about advertising

324
00:19:58,079 --> 00:20:04,223
Advertisers like him so much because he was able to use the content of his show to push the ad

325
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:06,783
Alex Carreon

326
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:07,551
Today

327
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:12,159
And I'm sure radio guys

328
00:20:12,415 --> 00:20:12,927
Looks like he is

329
00:20:13,183 --> 00:20:13,695
Episode

330
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:16,767
And over and over and over again

331
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:23,679
Episode

332
00:20:24,703 --> 00:20:28,031
It almost more structured than other episodes

333
00:20:28,287 --> 00:20:28,799
Amazon

334
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:31,871
First h s h in 3rd hour

335
00:20:32,127 --> 00:20:32,639
Discreet sex

336
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:36,223
There's still a little

337
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:38,015
Alex still goes off track

338
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:40,319
But there is definitely more of a feel of like

339
00:20:40,575 --> 00:20:41,087
Theme

340
00:20:41,343 --> 00:20:42,111
Phim

341
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:47,231
Sarasota

342
00:20:47,487 --> 00:20:51,839
Feels like it's possible or maybe Alex just like

343
00:20:52,095 --> 00:20:56,703
Recognizing that maybe I should try I don't know what it is but it's very different

344
00:20:57,983 --> 00:20:59,775
You know maybe the reason I'm going out of business

345
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:08,735
Baby that's the only thing that I have nobody to Market to it's really sucking up

346
00:21:10,527 --> 00:21:12,831
Maybe I should ask her myself

347
00:21:13,343 --> 00:21:14,879
It's too late for that but

348
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:16,159
It's interesting to see

349
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:17,440
The first

350
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:18,208
Section

351
00:21:18,464 --> 00:21:20,000
The episode Alex is trying to

352
00:21:20,256 --> 00:21:20,768
To push

353
00:21:21,024 --> 00:21:22,816
They want to abuse

354
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:23,584
Your kids in the

355
00:21:24,608 --> 00:21:26,144
Narrative

356
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,680
In the first hour

357
00:21:30,496 --> 00:21:32,288
Do you know there's some reasons that he's doing

358
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:33,312
Directional news

359
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:36,896
But most of it spirals out to really really disgusting talk

360
00:21:37,408 --> 00:21:39,200
And I'm going to try and keep that to a minimum

361
00:21:39,456 --> 00:21:40,224
Except where it snows

362
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,504
Necessary to

363
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:42,528
Explain what he's up to

364
00:21:43,296 --> 00:21:45,344
I think is really telling

365
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:48,672
Because I talked about his Jocelyn elders

366
00:21:48,928 --> 00:21:49,440
Ideas

367
00:21:49,952 --> 00:21:51,744
About what she was

368
00:21:53,536 --> 00:21:57,376
His ideas but she was saying manually

369
00:21:57,632 --> 00:21:58,400
Masturbate

370
00:21:58,656 --> 00:22:03,264
School children

371
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,288
Specifically

372
00:22:04,544 --> 00:22:07,360
Now guys I know a lot of people misunderstood me but

373
00:22:07,872 --> 00:22:08,384
Go to make my

374
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,152
Listen clear

375
00:22:09,408 --> 00:22:11,456
I want the teachers to jerk off Vicky

376
00:22:12,224 --> 00:22:15,808
It was not what you was about and I was not what you was advocating for.

377
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,600
He remembers that

378
00:22:19,136 --> 00:22:23,232
Any accidentally kind of reveals in this club first of all that she never said that

379
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:30,912
When I

380
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:33,216
Just one year out of high school

381
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:40,640
Real quick you my dear Lana Del Rey the background

382
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:41,920
Yeah he loves her

383
00:22:44,224 --> 00:22:45,504
Remember listening

384
00:22:49,344 --> 00:22:53,184
And I remember going looking at the things you was talking about

385
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,512
Play the audio

386
00:22:59,072 --> 00:23:00,864
Over and over again

387
00:23:01,376 --> 00:23:03,424
What you doing

388
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,704
Speak

389
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:08,288
Is your rates.

390
00:23:10,848 --> 00:23:12,128
Then she went to Congress

391
00:23:18,016 --> 00:23:19,040
I spent

392
00:23:19,296 --> 00:23:20,576
Hour-and-a-half

393
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:21,600
Obsessively

394
00:23:23,136 --> 00:23:24,928
Trying to find one

395
00:23:25,952 --> 00:23:26,464
Version

396
00:23:27,232 --> 00:23:29,792
But it's a bunch of cut

397
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:41,056
You spent an hour-and-a-half trying to find this clip excessively didn't find it because it's not a real thing that you said

398
00:23:41,312 --> 00:23:46,432
It's the right-wing spin that Rush Limbaugh had back then that you've internalized as the truth

399
00:23:46,688 --> 00:23:48,224
And you can't confirm it

400
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,504
Because it's not real

401
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:52,576
Seem like something

402
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:57,696
Claim and then people remember things

403
00:23:57,952 --> 00:24:02,816
I need to confirm that I'm right

404
00:24:03,584 --> 00:24:05,120
Weird

405
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,936
Real real

406
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:12,544
Real real big memory

407
00:24:13,568 --> 00:24:16,640
Mandela effect

408
00:24:16,896 --> 00:24:18,688
Jocelyn Elders was the elephant

409
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:25,344
And I didn't know that's how she supposed to do that impression quite a bit it's right up there with Bernie and hamsters like his favorite aunt

410
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:30,464
North of Ralph Northam characters

411
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:33,280
For sure

412
00:24:37,376 --> 00:24:42,240
The backlash Shane Gillis got this much backlash Alex Jones

413
00:24:42,496 --> 00:24:43,008
We ship

414
00:24:43,264 --> 00:24:49,408
I think I would give him a shot I figure you know people who work for us

415
00:25:02,464 --> 00:25:05,792
Probably more graphic than

416
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:07,840
I would like necessarily

417
00:25:08,096 --> 00:25:09,888
So it's necessary in order to get us

418
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,424
To the point

419
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:12,192
Of what he's doing

420
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:18,080
But when your daughter's vagina or your little son

421
00:25:23,712 --> 00:25:28,064
If they can do that

422
00:25:29,344 --> 00:25:32,928
Infowars.com and newswars.com slideshow

423
00:25:40,864 --> 00:25:42,912
Support

424
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:50,592
Little different

425
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:02,624
First of all

426
00:26:03,136 --> 00:26:03,648
Today's f

427
00:26:03,904 --> 00:26:04,416
Episode

428
00:26:04,672 --> 00:26:05,952
It's

429
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:06,976
Brings up an interesting

430
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:09,024
Same thing but I don't think I've ever fully explain

431
00:26:10,048 --> 00:26:11,840
I'm at is on Infowars actual website

432
00:26:12,096 --> 00:26:15,424
They have articles and then they also have posts for everyday

433
00:26:16,192 --> 00:26:20,032
Video embedded on it today's episode

434
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:24,128
And so what he's describing their that headlines

435
00:26:24,384 --> 00:26:30,016
It's the doors pedophilia world

436
00:26:30,528 --> 00:26:34,112
Typically the episodes post

437
00:26:34,368 --> 00:26:36,672
The video of the show but no substantiation of anything

438
00:26:37,184 --> 00:26:42,048
So specifics about the headline are anywhere to be found it's just quick

439
00:26:42,816 --> 00:26:48,960
I decided to check out the page anyways

440
00:26:49,472 --> 00:26:52,800
Make this official that the Democrats are now endorsing

441
00:26:53,568 --> 00:26:54,336
There's nothing for me

442
00:26:54,848 --> 00:26:55,872
But there are,

443
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:59,200
Here's a sampling of some of the responses from his listeners

444
00:27:00,224 --> 00:27:05,856
Quote Epstein was extracted in his cell phone the Dead Sea waiting for Hillary to take a rifle presidency

445
00:27:06,112 --> 00:27:07,648
And retroactively change

446
00:27:07,904 --> 00:27:08,416
Consent to sex

447
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:14,304
She'll be just in time to party Democrat donor Electro super delicate and KKK leader Ed Buck to

448
00:27:16,352 --> 00:27:19,168
Clearly

449
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:22,240
I'm not coming to claim to be the victim of Catholic

450
00:27:22,496 --> 00:27:27,104
The priest abuse and says he saw one of these people targeting

451
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,896
Another commenter replies quote

452
00:27:29,152 --> 00:27:30,432
No time like now

453
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:37,344
Another commenter says quote The Souls of our children and no one absolutely no one is doing anything to take mathematic

454
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,112
Collection 2

455
00:27:38,368 --> 00:27:38,880
Stop them

456
00:27:39,136 --> 00:27:43,744
Has done nothing absolutely nothing to save America's culture way of life liberty

457
00:27:44,256 --> 00:27:48,864
Without a single unified culture ethnicity there is nothing!

458
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:50,144
Separate

459
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:50,912
National

460
00:27:51,168 --> 00:27:52,704
Pretty much I'm going to go with

461
00:27:56,544 --> 00:27:57,056
Decriminalize

462
00:27:57,568 --> 00:28:03,712
Wilshire that's good another person I'll tell you what this is truly the directions public education is heading

463
00:28:03,968 --> 00:28:06,784
Public School teachers and administrators had better arm themselves

464
00:28:07,552 --> 00:28:11,904
That's really awesome

465
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:14,464
To hear all I'm hearing is look for

466
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:15,232
Peaceful transition

467
00:28:15,488 --> 00:28:16,512
Power in 2020

468
00:28:16,768 --> 00:28:19,584
I hope the war comes quick

469
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:24,192
This country is already past the point of no return the only way to get it back is to take

470
00:28:24,448 --> 00:28:25,216
It back sure

471
00:28:25,472 --> 00:28:25,984
Sure could work

472
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:32,384
Accelerationist belief on display hear this comment section

473
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:37,248
Looking for Alex isn't responsible for the actions of his listeners and Brie with that to a point

474
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:43,904
The reason the argument is pretty uncompelling to me though is that Alex is intentionally misleading his audience

475
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,440
Mostly explosive issues

476
00:28:45,696 --> 00:28:47,744
It's clearly doing it to make them

477
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:48,768
Beatles

478
00:28:49,024 --> 00:28:49,792
Commenters

479
00:28:50,304 --> 00:28:52,608
There's supposed to want to Outlaw political opposition

480
00:28:52,864 --> 00:28:54,656
They're supposed to want to threaten their enemies

481
00:28:54,912 --> 00:28:55,680
They're supposed to

482
00:28:55,936 --> 00:29:00,288
Feel so hopeless about the world that the possibility of

483
00:29:01,056 --> 00:29:03,616
These people very May well have had these feelings

484
00:29:04,896 --> 00:29:06,688
But the reporting style that he needs

485
00:29:06,944 --> 00:29:07,456
To use in order to

486
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:10,528
Keep making money justify those feeling

487
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,064
Nurture those feelings

488
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:13,344
To make them worse

489
00:29:14,368 --> 00:29:15,392
It would be hard for

490
00:29:15,648 --> 00:29:16,160
For me to believe

491
00:29:16,928 --> 00:29:17,440
Out

492
00:29:18,208 --> 00:29:19,232
Endless drum beat

493
00:29:19,488 --> 00:29:20,256
From Alex

494
00:29:21,792 --> 00:29:22,304
It's somebody would you

495
00:29:22,816 --> 00:29:23,840
Out of nowhere beer

496
00:29:24,608 --> 00:29:25,888
All of my sick

497
00:29:26,144 --> 00:29:27,680
Six-year-olds teachers are pedophile

498
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:29,728
Start a civil war

499
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,544
And they better arm themselves

500
00:29:33,312 --> 00:29:33,824
We're coming

501
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:36,128
Yeah I don't think

502
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,152
Spontaneous

503
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:41,248
We generate within within your grasp

504
00:29:41,504 --> 00:29:43,296
I bet for a small subset

505
00:29:43,552 --> 00:29:46,112
Hannah people I could buy

506
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:47,392
This feeling of being

507
00:29:47,648 --> 00:29:49,184
Expressed in these comments

508
00:29:50,464 --> 00:29:52,256
It's pretty it's pretty unnerving

509
00:29:52,768 --> 00:29:53,280
I would say

510
00:29:54,048 --> 00:29:55,840
So I looked into this and tried to

511
00:29:56,096 --> 00:29:57,376
Figure out what he's talking about

512
00:29:57,632 --> 00:29:58,144
It's

513
00:29:58,912 --> 00:30:01,472
There's an article in the mirror about the underlying topic

514
00:30:01,728 --> 00:30:02,496
Text Alex's discuss

515
00:30:07,616 --> 00:30:10,432
Totally made-up thing

516
00:30:10,944 --> 00:30:15,296
But it's more or less just sex education issues being turned into right with b******* about the future

517
00:30:15,552 --> 00:30:16,320
Performing sex acts

518
00:30:16,576 --> 00:30:17,088
Some kids

519
00:30:17,344 --> 00:30:19,136
The mirror article includes an image

520
00:30:19,392 --> 00:30:20,416
Depart of this manual

521
00:30:20,672 --> 00:30:24,256
Sex education

522
00:30:24,512 --> 00:30:27,584
It's not really even encouraging kids to masturbate

523
00:30:28,096 --> 00:30:30,912
The right-wing news people are are

524
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:36,288
It's really more saying that that is a normal thing people do and you shouldn't feel dirty about

525
00:30:37,056 --> 00:30:37,824
He didn't even like

526
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:39,616
Sexualizing really if you look at the

527
00:30:39,872 --> 00:30:40,384
The contact

528
00:30:41,664 --> 00:30:44,992
Lots of people like to tickle or stroke themselves as it might feel nice

529
00:30:45,248 --> 00:30:49,600
They may play with their hair stroke their skin or they may even touch their private parts

530
00:30:49,856 --> 00:30:50,880
This is very normal

531
00:30:53,696 --> 00:30:54,976
That's not sexualizing

532
00:30:55,232 --> 00:30:56,256
No you're you're just

533
00:30:56,512 --> 00:30:57,536
Is wrong everybody who died

534
00:30:59,328 --> 00:30:59,840
Hose Beast

535
00:31:00,096 --> 00:31:03,680
Then they should be condemned to hell

536
00:31:03,936 --> 00:31:04,448
Dictates

537
00:31:04,704 --> 00:31:06,496
There are

538
00:31:09,056 --> 00:31:10,848
What is an average day

539
00:31:11,616 --> 00:31:12,896
Everybody does

540
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:14,432
Nobody

541
00:31:14,688 --> 00:31:18,528
The right-wing is our galaxy

542
00:31:18,784 --> 00:31:19,552
To touch themselves in

543
00:31:19,808 --> 00:31:20,576
The better the shower

544
00:31:20,832 --> 00:31:24,160
Without giving any context to where that comes up in this manual

545
00:31:24,672 --> 00:31:28,000
Emmanuel's using those as examples of places it's appropriate

546
00:31:28,768 --> 00:31:33,888
Specifically to make the point that it's super inappropriate to do that so when other people are around

547
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:37,472
Quote it's not polite to do it when other people are about

548
00:31:37,728 --> 00:31:43,104
It's something we should only do when we're alone perhaps in the bathroom shower or in bed a bit like picking your nose

549
00:31:43,872 --> 00:31:45,920
This is not sexualizing this is

550
00:31:46,176 --> 00:31:47,200
Stigmatizing it's

551
00:31:52,832 --> 00:31:53,600
You can

552
00:31:53,856 --> 00:31:54,368
Hear myself

553
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:57,952
Ya hear that Carl

554
00:31:58,208 --> 00:32:00,768
In the bedroom are in the shower.

555
00:32:01,024 --> 00:32:07,168
It's not even clear it's not even clear that this manual is meant to be the curriculum itself

556
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:09,984
For the teachers

557
00:32:10,752 --> 00:32:12,544
I don't even know what the point is but

558
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:15,104
As far as I can tell this is also just a UK thing

559
00:32:15,616 --> 00:32:17,152
This is not America

560
00:32:17,408 --> 00:32:19,456
It's only at 240 schools in

561
00:32:19,712 --> 00:32:20,224
UK

562
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,248
For some contacts

563
00:32:21,504 --> 00:32:25,344
British educational suppliers Association estimates there are currently

564
00:32:25,856 --> 00:32:29,440
20925 primary schools in the United Kingdom

565
00:32:29,696 --> 00:32:34,048
This is very small portion better even possibly utilizing this curriculum

566
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:38,144
Alex is intentionally trying to conflate this story with the other story that we

567
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,680
We talked about about sex

568
00:32:39,936 --> 00:32:40,960
Classes in California

569
00:32:41,216 --> 00:32:47,360
And also with erroneously remembered ideas about what Jocelyn Elder said 20 years ago

570
00:32:47,616 --> 00:32:49,152
Narrative that will infuriate izadi

571
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:52,480
Hey based on the comments on his website it looks like it's working

572
00:32:52,736 --> 00:32:53,504
Pretty f****** well

573
00:32:54,784 --> 00:32:55,552
Yeah

574
00:32:56,832 --> 00:32:57,344
He's telling

575
00:32:57,856 --> 00:32:58,368
Play false

576
00:33:06,304 --> 00:33:07,072
Comfortable knowing

577
00:33:07,584 --> 00:33:08,096
He's 100

578
00:33:08,864 --> 00:33:15,008
Well if you want to have a conversation about like this should be taught at home as opposed to in school

579
00:33:15,264 --> 00:33:20,384
About it like if your problem is sincerely like this isn't appropriate at a school

580
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:23,456
Escalated to giving kids handjobs

581
00:33:23,712 --> 00:33:25,504
Do that

582
00:33:26,016 --> 00:33:27,552
You if you had a problem with

583
00:33:27,808 --> 00:33:28,832
Something real

584
00:33:29,088 --> 00:33:30,112
You wouldn't

585
00:33:30,368 --> 00:33:32,416
Completely exaggerated out to

586
00:33:32,672 --> 00:33:34,464
A completely absurd version

587
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:37,536
That only serves the purpose of radicalizing

588
00:33:38,048 --> 00:33:40,864
And you're already in the direction you want

589
00:33:41,632 --> 00:33:42,912
Capitalize

590
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,752
And that's exactly what Alex is doing

591
00:33:47,008 --> 00:33:48,032
He doesn't really long

592
00:33:48,288 --> 00:33:48,800
Disgusting

593
00:33:49,056 --> 00:33:50,080
Segment about this

594
00:33:50,336 --> 00:33:52,384
Immediately after

595
00:33:58,528 --> 00:34:00,064
Tomorrow's news today

596
00:34:01,344 --> 00:34:01,856
I've never

597
00:34:05,184 --> 00:34:05,952
Obsessed

598
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,048
Supermodel

599
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:16,960
He's literally claimed to be a Calvin Klein

600
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:21,824
He's talked about how we used to get beat up cuz he was too attractive

601
00:34:23,104 --> 00:34:27,968
I got present self or whatever

602
00:34:28,224 --> 00:34:30,784
He has for his youth is

603
00:34:31,808 --> 00:34:34,880
So he does this disgusting sex

604
00:34:35,136 --> 00:34:36,160
About the child

605
00:34:38,976 --> 00:34:40,000
This crucial report

606
00:34:40,256 --> 00:34:42,304
It starts with a never been saying

607
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,352
I like I don't like where this is heading

608
00:34:45,888 --> 00:34:46,400
Irritating

609
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:48,448
In the last

610
00:34:48,704 --> 00:34:49,216
Month

611
00:34:50,752 --> 00:34:51,264
Religious

612
00:34:55,104 --> 00:34:56,384
Nowhere so good

613
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:58,944
Wawa

614
00:35:00,224 --> 00:35:00,992
Drinking more water

615
00:35:01,504 --> 00:35:02,016
Workout

616
00:35:02,272 --> 00:35:02,784
Better

617
00:35:05,088 --> 00:35:06,112
Justin credible

618
00:35:07,648 --> 00:35:08,160
12

619
00:35:09,184 --> 00:35:09,696
Miramar

620
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:10,976
Great

621
00:35:13,024 --> 00:35:15,584
It it literally is just

622
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:21,472
Does all this rile people up anchors

623
00:35:21,728 --> 00:35:23,520
And then throws it to a special report

624
00:35:23,776 --> 00:35:24,544
Got a really

625
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:33,504
It's just a commercial being played on the actual show cuz he knows

626
00:35:41,184 --> 00:35:43,488
Migrated commercial onto the show

627
00:35:43,744 --> 00:35:45,536
They could not even him doing plug

628
00:35:46,048 --> 00:35:49,632
Just throw a commercial and pretend it's a special report and crazy

629
00:35:49,888 --> 00:35:51,936
That's probably something

630
00:35:52,192 --> 00:35:52,704
Needlepoint outages

631
00:35:53,472 --> 00:35:57,056
Content

632
00:35:57,312 --> 00:36:03,456
Disclaimer there Siri on Speedway

633
00:36:04,736 --> 00:36:06,272
So I was so

634
00:36:06,784 --> 00:36:07,808
Flabbergasted

635
00:36:08,064 --> 00:36:09,600
Did buy that like first of all

636
00:36:09,856 --> 00:36:11,136
The way he does these things

637
00:36:11,392 --> 00:36:12,160
About

638
00:36:12,672 --> 00:36:13,184
Like childish

639
00:36:13,952 --> 00:36:14,720
And that's what is so

640
00:36:14,976 --> 00:36:16,000
Utterly repulsive

641
00:36:16,512 --> 00:36:17,536
They always make

642
00:36:18,304 --> 00:36:18,816
Soulmate

643
00:36:19,328 --> 00:36:19,840
And then

644
00:36:20,352 --> 00:36:24,960
All just to be like a lead-in for this ad specialreport thing I was like

645
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:26,496
Go f*** yourself man

646
00:36:26,752 --> 00:36:32,384
I wanted to check in on two things in the present-day that might make us all feel a little better

647
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:33,920
Couple of things

648
00:36:34,176 --> 00:36:38,528
To serve as a barometer of what kind of Engagement

649
00:36:38,784 --> 00:36:40,320
He's actually getting in the present

650
00:36:41,088 --> 00:36:43,392
I felt like I would take a look at some of those

651
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,952
See what we can find out about House Fan

652
00:36:47,232 --> 00:36:51,328
The first thing we've seen recently was Alex launched his troll petition to get the White House

653
00:36:52,608 --> 00:36:53,888
As the 51st state

654
00:36:54,144 --> 00:36:56,704
Which also actually if you go look at it includes a suggestion

655
00:36:57,728 --> 00:37:01,056
Annex Antarctica is the 52nd state until the UN

656
00:37:01,312 --> 00:37:01,824
The f*** off

657
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:02,592
Okay

658
00:37:03,872 --> 00:37:10,016
Proposal proposal maybe it'll get water.

659
00:37:12,832 --> 00:37:18,720
Big-time celebrities

660
00:37:18,976 --> 00:37:21,536
Amplify

661
00:37:21,792 --> 00:37:22,816
Certainly

662
00:37:23,072 --> 00:37:23,584
Expand

663
00:37:24,608 --> 00:37:29,216
As of noon on September 24th this petition has been up for a 5

664
00:37:29,728 --> 00:37:31,264
Never 712

665
00:37:32,032 --> 00:37:34,336
Which is just shy of their goal of 100,000

666
00:37:34,592 --> 00:37:37,408
This is a really bad time

667
00:37:38,688 --> 00:37:41,504
Progress every every vote

668
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:47,392
This tells me that the Trolli meme crowd that Alex think fully supportive are either an imaginary audio

669
00:37:47,648 --> 00:37:48,672
Dance or they've left him

670
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:52,512
Like no matter how much you bring up Carpe donktum on the show that's

671
00:37:52,768 --> 00:37:53,280
Not your crowd

672
00:37:53,536 --> 00:37:56,352
Because if they were they would have AstroTurf the s*** out of that

673
00:38:00,192 --> 00:38:00,704
For the

674
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,496
The reality that Alex wishes

675
00:38:02,752 --> 00:38:03,264
Is to portray

676
00:38:04,032 --> 00:38:06,080
Yeah he's not going viral viral

677
00:38:08,896 --> 00:38:09,664
Let's storm area 5th

678
00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:11,968
That's not going to have

679
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:15,552
Clearly

680
00:38:15,808 --> 00:38:18,624
Meant to not have Infowars on it

681
00:38:19,136 --> 00:38:25,280
For the sake of like being able to repost it or whatever

682
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:26,048
Financials are

683
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:27,072
KB on it

684
00:38:29,888 --> 00:38:33,216
To like not put any red flags on here

685
00:38:33,984 --> 00:38:34,496
Too sad

686
00:38:34,752 --> 00:38:35,264
Is that is

687
00:38:38,336 --> 00:38:40,128
Carpe donktum

688
00:38:40,384 --> 00:38:41,664
On the show talks about him being great

689
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:46,272
Well he is

690
00:38:46,528 --> 00:38:51,392
Spirit world

691
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:56,768
YouTube social media center

692
00:38:57,536 --> 00:39:01,632
Play still looks like s*** I was scrolling through it quite a ways.

693
00:39:01,888 --> 00:39:03,936
Wife a butthead over 100 like

694
00:39:04,704 --> 00:39:07,776
It was Ben Garrison cartoons

695
00:39:08,288 --> 00:39:10,336
And it only had 104 likes

696
00:39:10,592 --> 00:39:11,104
Oh boy

697
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:11,872
I seized the dunk

698
00:39:13,152 --> 00:39:16,992
The cartoon Thomas Jefferson quote about the tree of Liberty

699
00:39:17,248 --> 00:39:23,136
Be watered with the blood of patriots and tyrants I can already see all of the Ben Garrison

700
00:39:26,208 --> 00:39:29,792
The cartoon is a tree

701
00:39:30,048 --> 00:39:36,192
A bird with a hammer and a sickle a caterpillar label Democrats

702
00:39:36,448 --> 00:39:36,960
Globalism

703
00:39:37,216 --> 00:39:39,264
Brilliant

704
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:42,336
Thirsty which is to say it's time for bloodshed

705
00:39:42,592 --> 00:39:47,456
Right I'm not sure I've seen a cartoon

706
00:39:47,712 --> 00:39:49,504
But also it's probably not that dangerous

707
00:39:50,016 --> 00:39:56,160
Event Garrison's audience need all those damn labels to get what he's trying to say I don't think they'll pick up on the subjects that he's saying

708
00:39:56,416 --> 00:39:57,696
People's blood

709
00:39:57,952 --> 00:39:58,464
Feed the tree

710
00:39:58,976 --> 00:40:02,816
If it's

711
00:40:04,864 --> 00:40:05,888
I am going to have some

712
00:40:06,144 --> 00:40:07,168
Complaints to the manager

713
00:40:13,824 --> 00:40:15,104
Label put it on you

714
00:40:15,616 --> 00:40:17,408
Hell

715
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:25,856
Subscribestar so I thought I would check in on that

716
00:40:26,624 --> 00:40:29,696
He currently only has 349 subscribers

717
00:40:29,952 --> 00:40:33,280
Profoundly low number for someone who claims to have the audience size

718
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:37,120
F****** Sargon of akkad is almost 2700

719
00:40:37,376 --> 00:40:37,888
Subscribers

720
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:41,216
Is a damning indictment of Alex's non popularity

721
00:40:41,984 --> 00:40:45,824
YouTube rip offs

722
00:40:46,592 --> 00:40:51,712
Yeah he claims that that you set up that site to be place where all the people from YouTube

723
00:40:51,968 --> 00:40:52,480
Disrespected

724
00:40:52,736 --> 00:40:53,760
Even though he says that

725
00:40:54,016 --> 00:40:56,064
It's still just an Avenue to put out in Fort Worth Conte

726
00:40:57,088 --> 00:40:58,624
Every single channel is one of his

727
00:40:58,880 --> 00:40:59,392
Employees

728
00:40:59,648 --> 00:41:00,672
Unsurprisingly

729
00:41:00,928 --> 00:41:02,464
Owen Shroyer David nights Channel

730
00:41:03,488 --> 00:41:04,000
Dead zone

731
00:41:04,256 --> 00:41:05,024
Almost no traffic

732
00:41:05,792 --> 00:41:09,376
The same is true of Alex's new show Firepower news

733
00:41:09,632 --> 00:41:12,448
Couldn't have less interest

734
00:41:13,472 --> 00:41:15,264
I don't I don't even know any

735
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:17,824
Don't care

736
00:41:18,336 --> 00:41:19,104
It's not going to last

737
00:41:20,128 --> 00:41:23,200
Something I found that kind of interesting is

738
00:41:23,456 --> 00:41:24,992
Also has terrible traffic

739
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:27,296
Realized

740
00:41:27,808 --> 00:41:33,952
Kicked off of course it has the real world

741
00:41:34,208 --> 00:41:38,560
It's like when it stuff is still available where it's always been that's going to be a problem

742
00:41:39,328 --> 00:41:41,376
His most popular asset doesn't really mean

743
00:41:41,632 --> 00:41:43,680
Meet the qualifications for being on this site

744
00:41:43,936 --> 00:41:44,448
Specifically

745
00:41:44,704 --> 00:41:45,728
He hasn't been there

746
00:41:46,496 --> 00:41:47,008
Video

747
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:52,895
Another issue is that there's no way for Alex to Alper monetization for any of these videos

748
00:41:53,663 --> 00:41:59,039
Do you have literally no appeal to most advertisers and there's no way that the Stoke Limerick guy can subsidize add

749
00:41:59,295 --> 00:42:02,367
All the crypto-fascist videos that site has the potential to host

750
00:42:03,135 --> 00:42:04,671
It's really a serious problem

751
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:05,951
It's like

752
00:42:06,463 --> 00:42:12,607
What he's doing is solving all the wrong problems right like the right-wing scammers on YouTube remotely

753
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:14,143
Mad cuz their scam got disrupt

754
00:42:14,655 --> 00:42:15,935
They figured out a game this

755
00:42:16,191 --> 00:42:19,007
Suggestion algorithm

756
00:42:19,263 --> 00:42:20,799
Massive amounts on Google ad Revenue

757
00:42:21,311 --> 00:42:24,127
Demonetization is just as bad as being kicked off for them

758
00:42:24,639 --> 00:42:25,919
And now it's really has no answer for

759
00:42:26,943 --> 00:42:30,783
Let's say one of these daunting for warriors employee Maga assholes comes over and wants

760
00:42:31,039 --> 00:42:32,063
Start posting pills here

761
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:38,463
There's no reason to expect there's ever going to be a way to replicate what they had with YouTube and no reason to suspect

762
00:42:38,719 --> 00:42:39,487
We're going to be money in it

763
00:42:40,255 --> 00:42:42,559
As a place where Alex can just post his videos

764
00:42:42,815 --> 00:42:44,351
It serves that function I guess

765
00:42:44,863 --> 00:42:45,631
Deep lyrics

766
00:42:45,887 --> 00:42:46,655
Survivor time

767
00:42:47,167 --> 00:42:48,959
The amount of content he wants to push it out to

768
00:42:51,519 --> 00:42:53,311
Vicksburg post

769
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:55,871
I could see this as a good decision to make

770
00:42:56,127 --> 00:42:56,639
Better time

771
00:42:57,151 --> 00:42:58,943
When you could afford to take a hit as an investment

772
00:42:59,199 --> 00:43:00,991
And something you could build into something

773
00:43:01,503 --> 00:43:04,063
Like you lose a million this year to make 10 billion in 5 years

774
00:43:05,087 --> 00:43:05,855
This kind of makes sense

775
00:43:08,415 --> 00:43:08,927
Desperate

776
00:43:09,439 --> 00:43:10,207
A little too late

777
00:43:10,975 --> 00:43:12,511
I don't think you have time

778
00:43:12,767 --> 00:43:14,815
To build this into what you want it to be

779
00:43:15,071 --> 00:43:17,631
You also would never want to allow for

780
00:43:17,887 --> 00:43:18,399
Beach on there

781
00:43:18,911 --> 00:43:21,471
But you never want that

782
00:43:24,543 --> 00:43:30,687
Course he doesn't want guns in his goddamn

783
00:43:30,943 --> 00:43:34,527
Like the idea that the complaint is that YouTube doesn't allow X

784
00:43:34,783 --> 00:43:36,831
On their channel on their platform

785
00:43:37,087 --> 00:43:43,231
Now you created your own platform

786
00:43:50,399 --> 00:43:51,679
If Alex were drunk

787
00:43:51,935 --> 00:43:55,263
And be very honest that's exactly what you would say

788
00:43:55,519 --> 00:44:01,663
To allow X

789
00:44:01,919 --> 00:44:04,479
You don't want to you don't have to

790
00:44:05,247 --> 00:44:05,759
Alright

791
00:44:06,015 --> 00:44:08,063
I've got to pitch for you this is my brilliant idea

792
00:44:10,367 --> 00:44:10,879
But made

793
00:44:11,135 --> 00:44:12,159
Sure no one wanted to

794
00:44:12,415 --> 00:44:13,439
To use it and no one would

795
00:44:14,719 --> 00:44:15,743
How does that sound as a business

796
00:44:16,511 --> 00:44:17,535
Look I got nothing else

797
00:44:17,791 --> 00:44:23,167
The drive Wolverine backed into a corner let's video

798
00:44:23,423 --> 00:44:23,935
Sure

799
00:44:26,751 --> 00:44:27,775
Little indications that I

800
00:44:28,031 --> 00:44:28,543
I can get are the

801
00:44:29,823 --> 00:44:31,871
Aldi's

802
00:44:32,383 --> 00:44:33,407
Sort of deduce

803
00:44:33,919 --> 00:44:34,687
Impact

804
00:44:35,455 --> 00:44:36,735
Don't match up with

805
00:44:37,247 --> 00:44:38,015
Alex

806
00:44:39,807 --> 00:44:40,831
And the way you present

807
00:44:41,087 --> 00:44:42,879
Is audience the millions and millions

808
00:44:43,647 --> 00:44:44,927
It matches up with a

809
00:44:45,183 --> 00:44:46,463
Fairly successful podcast

810
00:44:49,791 --> 00:44:52,095
Are about you know what you expect for the

811
00:44:52,351 --> 00:44:58,495
Not for a imonti stations all over the country and Putin listens to

812
00:44:58,751 --> 00:45:00,799
Yeah although now I think that puts

813
00:45:01,055 --> 00:45:02,591
Listen to running for shows Putin might listen

814
00:45:03,103 --> 00:45:04,895
I think

815
00:45:09,503 --> 00:45:13,087
And that is that Alex revealed why he went to LA

816
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:15,903
It was to be on T.I.'s new podcast

817
00:45:16,927 --> 00:45:19,487
T.i. podcast

818
00:45:21,791 --> 00:45:27,935
That is supposed to drop on Thursday

819
00:45:31,007 --> 00:45:31,775
It is not

820
00:45:32,287 --> 00:45:33,055
It is not the Thomas

821
00:45:33,823 --> 00:45:35,103
Star of

822
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:36,127
American Pie

823
00:45:39,455 --> 00:45:45,599
And I can't imagine not being a fight

824
00:45:45,855 --> 00:45:49,695
I don't know I will I don't want to listen to it but I do hope

825
00:45:49,951 --> 00:45:50,719
T.i.

826
00:45:52,511 --> 00:45:53,023
Podcast

827
00:45:55,327 --> 00:45:59,679
Alex back in Austin

828
00:46:00,191 --> 00:46:06,335
I think it probably will be a fight I don't know a very strong running for my cover on Friday

829
00:46:06,591 --> 00:46:08,639
Literal insanity

830
00:46:12,735 --> 00:46:16,063
This guy has much more of a reach than I could possibly hope for

831
00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:19,135
Let's do this even if he yells at me

832
00:46:22,207 --> 00:46:22,975
But

833
00:46:23,231 --> 00:46:27,327
Also on the first hour was that gross

834
00:46:27,583 --> 00:46:28,095
Child abuse

835
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:29,887
Second hour

836
00:46:30,143 --> 00:46:31,679
Alex gets into the The Climb

837
00:46:33,727 --> 00:46:37,823
So this is going to be right in your wheelhouse

838
00:46:38,335 --> 00:46:40,895
I can sense it

839
00:46:41,407 --> 00:46:43,199
So he's been rambling quite a bit

840
00:46:43,455 --> 00:46:44,223
This point about

841
00:46:46,015 --> 00:46:46,783
Just meant to

842
00:46:47,039 --> 00:46:48,063
Destroy

843
00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:50,367
America the weather

844
00:46:50,879 --> 00:46:54,975
It's really interesting here is the way he frames

845
00:46:55,231 --> 00:46:56,767
What the goal of

846
00:46:57,023 --> 00:46:58,815
These climate change initiatives is

847
00:47:01,375 --> 00:47:02,655
Sedam that are Target

848
00:47:03,679 --> 00:47:07,775
Europe

849
00:47:08,031 --> 00:47:12,639
The US Canada New Zealand Australia make the cuts and no one else does

850
00:47:22,367 --> 00:47:23,391
Not India

851
00:47:28,767 --> 00:47:29,791
Products

852
00:47:30,047 --> 00:47:31,071
Anyone but us

853
00:47:31,327 --> 00:47:31,839
I don't

854
00:47:39,007 --> 00:47:44,383
So now this is interesting

855
00:47:44,639 --> 00:47:48,735
List of countries

856
00:47:49,247 --> 00:47:52,063
Air Canada Australia

857
00:47:52,831 --> 00:47:54,879
It's weird that it's basically the exact list

858
00:47:55,135 --> 00:47:57,183
Countries that formed the acronym cause

859
00:47:57,439 --> 00:48:02,047
Which was the name of the organization founded by Neo-Nazi white supremacist

860
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:05,119
Alex's just swapped out New Zealand for South Africa

861
00:48:05,375 --> 00:48:08,703
You know when Lions made that organization

862
00:48:08,959 --> 00:48:11,007
It was in the 90s early 90s

863
00:48:11,263 --> 00:48:12,543
So South Africa b b

864
00:48:12,799 --> 00:48:14,847
More of an interest to him back

865
00:48:15,103 --> 00:48:15,615
Not know about

866
00:48:16,383 --> 00:48:17,407
We talked about it.

867
00:48:17,663 --> 00:48:20,479
Appliance EMT Patriots defense fund

868
00:48:20,735 --> 00:48:23,807
Specifically designed like a white supremacist

869
00:48:24,063 --> 00:48:30,207
After a little while it was a little bit too problematic

870
00:48:30,463 --> 00:48:30,975
Does the first

871
00:48:31,231 --> 00:48:32,255
Pro White Law Firm

872
00:48:32,511 --> 00:48:38,655
Because Lions felt like

873
00:48:38,911 --> 00:48:39,935
Countries where the white race

874
00:48:40,191 --> 00:48:40,703
Was under attack

875
00:48:41,215 --> 00:48:44,287
This grouping of countries constitute

876
00:48:45,823 --> 00:48:47,615
Is closely related to older whites

877
00:48:47,871 --> 00:48:50,431
Supremacist beliefs and propaganda about those being white

878
00:48:51,199 --> 00:48:55,039
The places where a white majority would be threatened by the Eagles

879
00:48:56,063 --> 00:48:57,087
That could be a coincidence

880
00:48:57,599 --> 00:48:58,367
That Alex is using

881
00:49:00,159 --> 00:49:03,487
But we've also heard

882
00:49:03,743 --> 00:49:04,511
Is the same thing as white

883
00:49:07,327 --> 00:49:08,351
Supremacist

884
00:49:08,607 --> 00:49:10,143
And applying them to the climate change

885
00:49:10,399 --> 00:49:10,911
Conversation

886
00:49:11,679 --> 00:49:15,263
The reason that this feels like explicit white supremacist propaganda being masked

887
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:18,079
Does beating something up being about something

888
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:21,151
Is it only these

889
00:49:21,407 --> 00:49:24,479
Cortical white countries to lower their carbon emissions

890
00:49:24,735 --> 00:49:28,063
But that's never been true of any climate change initiative ever

891
00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:29,855
Yeah I'm pretty sure that was

892
00:49:30,623 --> 00:49:31,391
Put out

893
00:49:31,903 --> 00:49:32,927
Immediately after the

894
00:49:33,951 --> 00:49:35,743
Treaty was signed like the right wing

895
00:49:35,999 --> 00:49:36,511
Immediately

896
00:49:37,279 --> 00:49:42,143
Producers of a

897
00:49:43,679 --> 00:49:44,959
Is in the world in Daytona

898
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:48,031
Everybody everybody

899
00:49:48,543 --> 00:49:49,055
Well

900
00:49:49,823 --> 00:49:50,335
Start from the

901
00:49:51,871 --> 00:49:54,431
Enforcement

902
00:49:54,943 --> 00:49:56,479
No one was forced to

903
00:49:56,991 --> 00:49:57,503
I caught

904
00:49:57,759 --> 00:50:00,063
The things that we can do as a country or things

905
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:06,463
Are carbon credits

906
00:50:06,719 --> 00:50:12,863
If you had

907
00:50:14,655 --> 00:50:16,447
Used in order to help with the climate

908
00:50:16,703 --> 00:50:17,215
Situation

909
00:50:17,471 --> 00:50:20,031
Of course those are only going to impact.

910
00:50:20,287 --> 00:50:21,055
But I do

911
00:50:21,567 --> 00:50:24,127
Be a leader in the world and other countries follow

912
00:50:24,639 --> 00:50:29,247
You can't just be like a high we're going to enforce our system on a

913
00:50:34,367 --> 00:50:35,903
He wants a

914
00:50:36,159 --> 00:50:36,671
Large

915
00:50:37,183 --> 00:50:38,463
Governing body

916
00:50:39,231 --> 00:50:40,255
To force

917
00:50:41,023 --> 00:50:41,791
Countries

918
00:50:42,303 --> 00:50:43,071
To do

919
00:50:43,327 --> 00:50:43,839
What it

920
00:50:44,607 --> 00:50:45,119
Says

921
00:50:46,143 --> 00:50:48,959
Did you know in spite of their

922
00:50:49,215 --> 00:50:49,983
Some word

923
00:50:50,239 --> 00:50:50,751
Sovereignty

924
00:50:52,031 --> 00:50:53,823
That word is

925
00:50:56,127 --> 00:51:00,479
Doesn't depict reality

926
00:51:00,735 --> 00:51:05,343
I'm not sure if all of them because some of the developing countries in the world actually had Target

927
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:07,903
That work increases in their CO2 emissions

928
00:51:08,415 --> 00:51:10,975
Because of needs that they would have in terms of

929
00:51:11,231 --> 00:51:13,279
Developing industrialization

930
00:51:13,535 --> 00:51:15,839
To help their countries

931
00:51:16,095 --> 00:51:18,911
There's no real bulshit about how these agreement

932
00:51:19,167 --> 00:51:21,983
Climate change initiatives only Target

933
00:51:22,751 --> 00:51:28,895
Glaringly like this

Additional white supremacist

Worldview

936
00:51:31,967 --> 00:51:33,247
It's enough to make me pretty

937
00:51:33,503 --> 00:51:36,063
Suspicious about what point houses really trying to make

938
00:51:37,343 --> 00:51:37,855
Feels

939
00:51:38,367 --> 00:51:39,647
Not about climate change

940
00:51:40,671 --> 00:51:41,439
It feels like

941
00:51:43,999 --> 00:51:44,511
It's all around the world

942
00:51:45,535 --> 00:51:47,071
Provino's Restaurant

943
00:51:51,423 --> 00:51:51,935
We're just White

944
00:51:52,959 --> 00:51:55,007
Around here

945
00:51:55,263 --> 00:51:55,775
You know

946
00:51:56,031 --> 00:52:00,127
White knit up finger guns listen to Lana Del Rey

947
00:52:01,663 --> 00:52:02,175
Cool

948
00:52:02,431 --> 00:52:05,247
Of course

949
00:52:06,271 --> 00:52:07,039
What evil they are

950
00:52:08,575 --> 00:52:09,855
Sure

951
00:52:10,367 --> 00:52:11,135
He makes the claim that

952
00:52:11,647 --> 00:52:12,415
Absolutely honest

953
00:52:16,511 --> 00:52:18,303
The world

954
00:52:21,375 --> 00:52:22,143
Enesco

955
00:52:22,911 --> 00:52:25,471
System of the UN

956
00:52:26,239 --> 00:52:27,775
Haitian culture logic

957
00:52:28,031 --> 00:52:28,543
Jason

958
00:52:28,799 --> 00:52:29,311
Organization

959
00:52:29,823 --> 00:52:33,919
Global policy

960
00:52:48,767 --> 00:52:49,279
This is just

961
00:52:52,095 --> 00:52:53,631
25 years ago at

962
00:52:54,911 --> 00:52:55,423
Briefly

963
00:52:55,679 --> 00:52:58,239
In case anyone hasn't heard the episode where we went over this

964
00:52:58,495 --> 00:53:01,311
In 1993 the international lesbian and gay Association

965
00:53:01,567 --> 00:53:02,591
Applied for consultative

966
00:53:02,847 --> 00:53:04,639
Status with the UN economic and social

967
00:53:05,919 --> 00:53:10,015
In the process it was found that NAMBLA was a member group within the ilga

968
00:53:10,271 --> 00:53:12,831
At which point the ilga full membership voted to

969
00:53:13,087 --> 00:53:14,623
Spell NAMBLA from the organization

970
00:53:14,879 --> 00:53:17,695
Reflecting a possible unawareness that they were affiliated with the group

971
00:53:17,951 --> 00:53:18,463
To begin with

972
00:53:18,975 --> 00:53:23,327
Jessie Holmes introduced a bill to make

973
00:53:23,583 --> 00:53:25,887
Dissociative do you want head pro pedophilia View

974
00:53:26,399 --> 00:53:29,983
Resulting in Section 102 of the Foreign Relations authorization Act

975
00:53:30,495 --> 00:53:32,543
Of 1954 and 1995

976
00:53:33,311 --> 00:53:37,663
It's a matter of withholding all funding to the UN if their group

977
00:53:37,919 --> 00:53:40,223
Associated groups with pedophilia

978
00:53:40,735 --> 00:53:42,015
UNESCO is one such group

979
00:53:42,271 --> 00:53:43,551
Requirements

980
00:53:43,807 --> 00:53:45,855
Describing is literally

981
00:53:46,111 --> 00:53:47,391
And it'll legitimately

982
00:53:48,927 --> 00:53:53,791
Zero idea what Alex means by saying that Annapolis on UNESCO steering board

983
00:53:54,303 --> 00:53:58,655
Different initiatives that UNESCO undertakes usually have different boards to accomplish different goals

984
00:53:58,911 --> 00:53:59,679
However

985
00:54:00,191 --> 00:54:01,983
UNESCO does keep a very public

986
00:54:02,751 --> 00:54:05,055
Tons of non-governmental organizations that they work

987
00:54:05,567 --> 00:54:06,335
What do you know

988
00:54:06,847 --> 00:54:07,871
Blazing on that list

989
00:54:08,127 --> 00:54:08,895
Because a f******

990
00:54:09,151 --> 00:54:09,919
Corsair.

991
00:54:10,687 --> 00:54:12,735
I don't know if they'd ever take the time to sue

992
00:54:12,991 --> 00:54:14,527
But this is probably legally

993
00:54:14,783 --> 00:54:15,295
Slander

994
00:54:17,855 --> 00:54:20,159
I don't I don't know how that would work or anyting but

995
00:54:20,415 --> 00:54:21,695
That's definitely

996
00:54:22,207 --> 00:54:22,975
Malicious

997
00:54:23,487 --> 00:54:25,791
Lie

998
00:54:26,303 --> 00:54:28,863
Yeah he has reason to know that that's not true

999
00:54:29,119 --> 00:54:32,191
Absolutely so I don't know I think that's probably

1000
00:54:32,959 --> 00:54:33,471
Desi

1001
00:54:36,543 --> 00:54:37,567
And it's not like we

1002
00:54:37,823 --> 00:54:39,103
You know it is a wood bee

1003
00:54:39,871 --> 00:54:40,383
Sue him

1004
00:54:47,295 --> 00:54:49,599
Permutations

1005
00:54:49,855 --> 00:54:55,999
He says the part of every group that he wants to attack internationally

1006
00:54:56,255 --> 00:55:00,095
Episode

1007
00:55:00,351 --> 00:55:01,887
Whose daughter was one of the victims

1008
00:55:02,143 --> 00:55:03,167
Parkland shooting

1009
00:55:03,679 --> 00:55:05,727
I don't have any clips of this interview because I find the whole thing

1010
00:55:05,983 --> 00:55:06,751
Deeply upsetting

1011
00:55:07,263 --> 00:55:11,359
I would venture to guess that doesn't have a good idea who Alex

1012
00:55:11,615 --> 00:55:13,151
But he's done even surrounded Park

1013
00:55:13,407 --> 00:55:14,175
When shooting itself

1014
00:55:14,431 --> 00:55:16,479
And if you did I would assume you wouldn't want to

1015
00:55:17,759 --> 00:55:22,367
I find little interest in critiquing the interview with the parents of a victim of a school shooting on Alex

1016
00:55:22,623 --> 00:55:24,415
Shoe Show

1017
00:55:24,671 --> 00:55:25,951
Is generally Alex being a dick in

1018
00:55:26,207 --> 00:55:27,231
It's not really all that worth

1019
00:55:27,999 --> 00:55:28,767
Also I mean

1020
00:55:29,023 --> 00:55:29,535
Pollack dozen

1021
00:55:29,791 --> 00:55:31,327
Don't seem like he's all that

1022
00:55:32,351 --> 00:55:32,863
Carstarphen

1023
00:55:33,375 --> 00:55:34,399
I don't want to mock him

1024
00:55:34,655 --> 00:55:35,423
Even if he has

1025
00:55:35,679 --> 00:55:36,191
Some beliefs

1026
00:55:36,447 --> 00:55:36,959
That are

1027
00:55:37,215 --> 00:55:38,239
I can definitely tell you

1028
00:55:38,495 --> 00:55:40,031
I could have debunked the number of

1029
00:55:40,799 --> 00:55:42,847
I just take no pleasure in that

1030
00:55:51,295 --> 00:55:55,903
Not mentioned in this interview that Pollock was instrumental in helping get Florida Senate bills

1031
00:55:56,159 --> 00:55:56,671
26 pack

1032
00:55:58,975 --> 00:55:59,743
Teachers carry guns

1033
00:55:59,999 --> 00:56:01,535
It's probably fine

1034
00:56:02,303 --> 00:56:06,655
However it also raised the age to buy a gun from 18 to 21

1035
00:56:06,911 --> 00:56:08,191
Haband the sale of bump stocks

1036
00:56:08,447 --> 00:56:08,959
Provision

1037
00:56:09,215 --> 00:56:09,727
Forlorn Forest

1038
00:56:09,983 --> 00:56:10,495
To take your guns

1039
00:56:11,263 --> 00:56:13,055
It made it so cops competition

1040
00:56:13,311 --> 00:56:15,871
Courts to take your guns and ammo if they think you're a danger

1041
00:56:16,127 --> 00:56:19,199
It made it so if you've ever been committed to a mental hospital

1042
00:56:19,455 --> 00:56:19,967
Can't have gone

1043
00:56:20,223 --> 00:56:21,247
Creative

1044
00:56:21,503 --> 00:56:22,015
Bygone

1045
00:56:22,783 --> 00:56:26,623
This is exactly the sort of Bill vitalik screams about all the time

1046
00:56:26,879 --> 00:56:29,439
To him and he has a as his guest someone was

1047
00:56:29,695 --> 00:56:31,743
Instrumental in getting gun-grabbing path

1048
00:56:31,999 --> 00:56:33,023
And get Alex doesn't

1049
00:56:33,279 --> 00:56:34,815
Seem to know about that or else

1050
00:56:35,071 --> 00:56:36,351
He thinks it's better for his narrative

1051
00:56:36,607 --> 00:56:37,375
To just ignore it

1052
00:56:38,143 --> 00:56:40,447
If I had to guess Alex knows the Pollock

1053
00:56:40,703 --> 00:56:42,239
I called for better safety

1054
00:56:42,495 --> 00:56:43,519
And try to refocus

1055
00:56:43,775 --> 00:56:45,823
Debate about gun Centric

1056
00:56:46,079 --> 00:56:46,591
Being safety

1057
00:56:47,359 --> 00:56:48,639
And Alex knows he can work with

1058
00:56:49,919 --> 00:56:56,063
Alex brother knows that he's being sued by Sandy Hook parents right now in Alaska

1059
00:56:58,111 --> 00:57:01,183
It's best for the brand to pretend that he wasn't involved in the Bell

1060
00:57:01,439 --> 00:57:07,583
And then later you can be all about how Sandy Hook parents are this kind of monster

1061
00:57:08,863 --> 00:57:10,911
It's pretty decent albeit Transpo

1062
00:57:11,167 --> 00:57:12,703
Parrot as a move for him to make

1063
00:57:13,215 --> 00:57:15,775
Ultimately it bores me and it seems like Alex is just using

1064
00:57:16,031 --> 00:57:17,823
If someone has a prop but that's nothing new

1065
00:57:18,079 --> 00:57:19,615
Yeah that that has

1066
00:57:21,407 --> 00:57:23,199
Toss-up ID on the Whiteboard

1067
00:57:25,247 --> 00:57:29,855
Optics how do we change the narrative

1068
00:57:30,111 --> 00:57:32,671
Oh I know we have

1069
00:57:32,927 --> 00:57:34,719
Somebody involved in those and we can be like

1070
00:57:34,975 --> 00:57:40,863
I believe you this is 100% real and I made mistakes in the book

1071
00:57:41,119 --> 00:57:44,959
And he's trying to sell that books at work

1072
00:57:46,495 --> 00:57:47,775
Beyond but

1073
00:57:48,287 --> 00:57:50,079
I don't know I'm not Charmed by that

1074
00:57:50,847 --> 00:57:51,871
I don't want to pile on this

1075
00:57:52,383 --> 00:57:53,151
B o

1076
00:57:53,407 --> 00:57:53,919
Stressed out

1077
00:57:55,455 --> 00:57:55,967
No

1078
00:57:56,223 --> 00:57:58,271
In the past is talk about how the new world order

1079
00:57:58,527 --> 00:57:59,295
The Illuminati

1080
00:57:59,807 --> 00:58:00,575
Approached his father

1081
00:58:00,831 --> 00:58:01,599
David Jones

1082
00:58:01,855 --> 00:58:02,879
Dentist

1083
00:58:03,647 --> 00:58:05,695
Either you got a protista literal

1084
00:58:07,231 --> 00:58:08,255
Beetlejuice yes

1085
00:58:08,767 --> 00:58:09,535
The whole thing

1086
00:58:09,791 --> 00:58:14,399
And they offered him to join up with them

1087
00:58:14,655 --> 00:58:15,935
To be world

1088
00:58:16,191 --> 00:58:19,007
Royalty or whatever

1089
00:58:19,263 --> 00:58:19,775
DPS

1090
00:58:20,799 --> 00:58:21,311
No thank you

1091
00:58:21,567 --> 00:58:23,103
He's not

1092
00:58:23,359 --> 00:58:24,895
He saw through their b******* right away

1093
00:58:25,151 --> 00:58:27,199
Is genius one of the smartest people in

1094
00:58:27,711 --> 00:58:28,223
It's from the agent

1095
00:58:28,991 --> 00:58:35,135
Well the stories change the little bit

1096
00:58:35,391 --> 00:58:36,415
Play Civilization

1097
00:58:38,975 --> 00:58:40,255
Explain God

1098
00:58:54,591 --> 00:58:55,615
Lisa first time

1099
00:58:56,383 --> 00:58:56,895
What

1100
00:58:57,151 --> 00:58:58,943
But the point is what

1101
00:58:59,199 --> 00:59:00,991
Know what will follow

1102
00:59:01,247 --> 00:59:07,391
So they asked if

1103
00:59:08,415 --> 00:59:14,047
What does that mean about you Alex

1104
00:59:15,583 --> 00:59:17,119
This is stupid

1105
00:59:18,655 --> 00:59:21,983
Abby doesn't clarify that.

1106
00:59:22,239 --> 00:59:23,007
The first time

1107
00:59:27,615 --> 00:59:33,759
Because I don't believe anything he says I don't care about that but it is funny

1108
00:59:34,783 --> 00:59:35,295
Is he in there now

1109
00:59:35,551 --> 00:59:40,159
That the most important thing about this

1110
00:59:40,415 --> 00:59:46,559
Alex said the name of the person who tried to lure him into this cult globalist

1111
00:59:47,583 --> 00:59:49,119
Dr. Erwin spear

1112
00:59:51,679 --> 00:59:55,263
The 2013 is outside the statute of limitation

1113
00:59:57,055 --> 00:59:58,335
Context of human amen

1114
00:59:58,591 --> 01:00:00,639
Who the person is that he's talking about

1115
01:00:01,919 --> 01:00:04,479
A day ago retelling the story

1116
01:00:06,015 --> 01:00:11,903
To take one and one together that's the story about there's every expectation

1117
01:00:12,159 --> 01:00:13,951
In every reasonable person

1118
01:00:14,207 --> 01:00:14,975
Would know

1119
01:00:15,231 --> 01:00:18,047
That he's talking about the same event in his father's

1120
01:00:18,303 --> 01:00:20,863
He has just committed slander again

1121
01:00:21,119 --> 01:00:23,167
He has renewed the statute of limitations

1122
01:00:23,423 --> 01:00:25,983
Erwin Spears family could absolutely sue him for

1123
01:00:26,239 --> 01:00:31,359
I don't know if they become less and less Irwin Spears was involved in this

1124
01:00:32,127 --> 01:00:33,151
It really doesn't matter

1125
01:00:33,407 --> 01:00:34,687
I don't know if they would win

1126
01:00:34,943 --> 01:00:36,479
But he is absolutely in jeopardy

1127
01:00:36,735 --> 01:00:41,087
Because of that brought up the story that he has explained in the past

1128
01:00:41,599 --> 01:00:44,415
And from what I understand

1129
01:00:44,671 --> 01:00:45,695
That does renew

1130
01:00:49,535 --> 01:00:52,607
I'm glad that you re up the subscription to getting sued

1131
01:00:52,863 --> 01:00:53,375
For the rest of his

1132
01:00:53,631 --> 01:00:57,983
So just on this episode we have UNESCO Spears estate

1133
01:00:59,519 --> 01:01:05,407
Possible litigants against Alex

1134
01:01:10,783 --> 01:01:11,551
I know you probably have

1135
01:01:16,159 --> 01:01:19,231
So Alex gets around to talking about how

1136
01:01:19,743 --> 01:01:21,023
The ruling class

1137
01:01:21,279 --> 01:01:21,791
They're coming out now

1138
01:01:23,327 --> 01:01:23,839
Kill Everybody

1139
01:01:24,607 --> 01:01:26,655
And there's an element of this that makes Alex

1140
01:01:26,911 --> 01:01:27,423
Mad

1141
01:01:27,679 --> 01:01:28,191
Trump

1142
01:01:31,775 --> 01:01:35,103
Disconnected from us now

1143
01:01:35,615 --> 01:01:38,943
Get rid of all of you for the Earth

1144
01:02:05,567 --> 01:02:08,895
Are you afraid to go to the mailbox because it letter after letter from the IRS

1145
01:02:09,151 --> 01:02:10,687
Great transition

1146
01:02:11,455 --> 01:02:17,343
Miracle cures are coming

1147
01:02:18,111 --> 01:02:19,135
Will not

1148
01:02:19,391 --> 01:02:21,183
Look into Occam's razor

1149
01:02:23,487 --> 01:02:23,999
Why is

1150
01:02:31,423 --> 01:02:33,215
Now I'm going to throw this out there

1151
01:02:33,727 --> 01:02:34,751
He was lying

1152
01:02:35,007 --> 01:02:39,871
The crisis is like falling for a con

1153
01:02:40,383 --> 01:02:40,895
Deeper

1154
01:02:48,575 --> 01:02:50,367
It's one of those things where a lot of

1155
01:02:50,879 --> 01:02:51,903
What some of the old

1156
01:02:53,183 --> 01:02:53,951
Get away with it so much

1157
01:02:54,975 --> 01:02:55,487
Because

1158
01:02:56,767 --> 01:02:57,535
Who is too embarrassing

1159
01:02:57,791 --> 01:02:59,071
Sing to reveal

1160
01:03:05,983 --> 01:03:07,775
6 million dollars

1161
01:03:08,031 --> 01:03:14,175
I've staked my career

1162
01:03:14,431 --> 01:03:15,455
Built over decades

1163
01:03:15,711 --> 01:03:17,503
Yep

1164
01:03:18,015 --> 01:03:18,783
Based on the

1165
01:03:19,039 --> 01:03:20,319
Convert this guy was running

1166
01:03:21,855 --> 01:03:27,999
You might as well would be like pushing for Randy Cramer

1167
01:03:37,215 --> 01:03:40,543
Alright

1168
01:03:41,055 --> 01:03:42,079
Feels like s*** but

1169
01:03:42,591 --> 01:03:43,359
It's just really sad

1170
01:03:44,383 --> 01:03:46,687
He's an adult really sad

1171
01:03:49,503 --> 01:03:50,783
So there's bad you Betty is

1172
01:03:51,295 --> 01:03:53,343
Climate change

1173
01:03:53,599 --> 01:03:55,647
Conversation that Alex has

1174
01:03:55,903 --> 01:03:57,439
From a little bit here but he gets back to it

1175
01:03:57,695 --> 01:04:02,815
And the bottom line is that Alex is trying to push the idea that they're just trying to

1176
01:04:03,071 --> 01:04:03,583
Are you

1177
01:04:04,095 --> 01:04:09,215
All the stuff is all based on

1178
01:04:09,471 --> 01:04:09,983
Beer

1179
01:04:10,239 --> 01:04:16,383
Does ironic for Alex to be complaining about quite frankly

1180
01:04:16,639 --> 01:04:20,735
In his work

1181
01:04:20,991 --> 01:04:21,503
But he

1182
01:04:22,015 --> 01:04:24,575
Really stressing over and over again they admit

1183
01:04:24,831 --> 01:04:25,599
That they're just trying to

1184
01:04:25,855 --> 01:04:26,367
The scare you

1185
01:04:28,415 --> 01:04:30,207
There's so much

1186
01:04:30,719 --> 01:04:31,231
Unpacking here

1187
01:04:31,743 --> 01:04:32,255
I'm sure you're going to

1188
01:04:33,279 --> 01:04:36,863
First world

1189
01:04:41,727 --> 01:04:45,055
And this is the talking points and then a woman is one

1190
01:04:46,847 --> 01:04:49,151
Element

1191
01:04:51,711 --> 01:04:53,503
I teach a penguins are dying

1192
01:04:53,759 --> 01:04:56,063
They teach him that they can't swim

1193
01:04:59,135 --> 01:05:02,719
They're not drowning

1194
01:05:04,767 --> 01:05:06,815
Middle School girls commit suicide

1195
01:05:13,471 --> 01:05:17,055
Lead people saying that they're just trying to scare you

1196
01:05:17,311 --> 01:05:18,847
I was trying to figure out what he's talking about

1197
01:05:19,103 --> 01:05:20,639
Cuz he doesn't use any specific

1198
01:05:20,895 --> 01:05:25,503
The EPA McCarthy

1199
01:05:25,759 --> 01:05:28,319
She recently did an interview with scientific America

1200
01:05:28,831 --> 01:05:31,391
He's talking about

1201
01:05:31,647 --> 01:05:32,159
For Alex

1202
01:05:32,671 --> 01:05:36,767
Any interview McCarthy has asked about taking a more systemic approach to climate issues

1203
01:05:37,279 --> 01:05:39,071
The conversation

1204
01:05:39,327 --> 01:05:42,399
Has largely shifted from one where the question is is this happening

1205
01:05:42,911 --> 01:05:44,703
To a question of what should we do

1206
01:05:45,215 --> 01:05:50,847
She commenced Cory Booker's recent comments about how his cabinet would view all of their jobs through the lens of climb

1207
01:05:51,359 --> 01:05:52,895
It goes on to list a few ways this

1208
01:05:53,151 --> 01:05:56,223
Play out in the real world like the military converting to renewable ener

1209
01:05:59,807 --> 01:06:02,623
All these provide opportunities for the entire complexion to the

1210
01:06:02,879 --> 01:06:04,415
The discussion to change from I want to

1211
01:06:04,671 --> 01:06:06,975
Are you into doing something on climate to

1212
01:06:07,231 --> 01:06:09,535
Let's be smarter about federal dollars being spent

1213
01:06:09,791 --> 01:06:13,119
People are demanding action that's going to be benefits

1214
01:06:13,375 --> 01:06:13,887
For their help

1215
01:06:14,399 --> 01:06:19,519
She's explicitly saying that she wants to be I want to do mentality to not be how the debate is Freya

1216
01:06:20,287 --> 01:06:24,639
If this is what I was talking about Alex and all the right-wing just repeat this bullshiter

1217
01:06:24,895 --> 01:06:27,455
Completely 100% without a doubt intentionally

1218
01:06:27,711 --> 01:06:30,015
Consciously taking McCarthy statements out of

1219
01:06:31,039 --> 01:06:34,367
The only other possibility is that they didn't even read one sentence over words

1220
01:06:34,623 --> 01:06:35,903
Then decided to attack her anyway

1221
01:06:36,415 --> 01:06:40,255
This is some b******* right here that's only if this is what he's talking about

1222
01:06:40,511 --> 01:06:41,279
And I have

1223
01:06:41,535 --> 01:06:44,095
I have every reason to assume

1224
01:06:44,351 --> 01:06:49,727
Because this interview came out like a day before this episode it's like it's fresh new now this is Almeda

1225
01:06:50,495 --> 01:06:54,079
I mean the whole that whole like

1226
01:06:55,359 --> 01:06:56,895
They're just trying to scare you thing

1227
01:06:57,407 --> 01:06:58,175
That

1228
01:06:58,431 --> 01:06:59,455
Guarantee that this is

1229
01:06:59,711 --> 01:07:00,479
Is all made up because

1230
01:07:01,247 --> 01:07:02,527
It's coming from everything

1231
01:07:02,783 --> 01:07:03,295
Single gas

1232
01:07:05,855 --> 01:07:08,927
It's coming from anchors are any

1233
01:07:09,695 --> 01:07:10,719
They're specifically

1234
01:07:10,975 --> 01:07:11,743
Please stay out of it

1235
01:07:14,303 --> 01:07:16,095
They're just coming out here to make

1236
01:07:18,911 --> 01:07:19,679
Substantiated

1237
01:07:20,703 --> 01:07:21,727
And if the news

1238
01:07:21,983 --> 01:07:23,007
Innovation word

1239
01:07:24,031 --> 01:07:25,823
Coming out here

1240
01:07:27,359 --> 01:07:30,175
Afraid with literally anything

1241
01:07:31,455 --> 01:07:32,479
That is a good point

1242
01:07:32,735 --> 01:07:38,111
And actually I do know what happened

1243
01:07:38,367 --> 01:07:42,719
I honestly thought this is what he was talking about but the reality is far stupid

1244
01:07:42,975 --> 01:07:49,119
McCarthy's comment because she does say the I want to scare you

1245
01:07:49,375 --> 01:07:50,399
You took that out of context

1246
01:07:51,423 --> 01:07:57,567
It makes total sense

1247
01:07:57,823 --> 01:07:59,871
Nonspecific about it like it makes them

1248
01:08:00,127 --> 01:08:06,271
That this is what he's pointing to its so much more disappointing close to right

1249
01:08:07,295 --> 01:08:10,367
Before we get to all that in the realities there

1250
01:08:11,135 --> 01:08:12,415
Little bit about this polar bears

1251
01:08:13,439 --> 01:08:19,071
Alex constantly makes a grave error in his attacks on the narratives the constitutionalist have about polar bear population

1252
01:08:19,839 --> 01:08:22,399
Their arguments aren't necessarily the polar bears are all dying off

1253
01:08:22,655 --> 01:08:25,215
Now it's set in the future their species

1254
01:08:25,471 --> 01:08:26,239
Serious Danger

1255
01:08:27,007 --> 01:08:29,567
Polar bears of fluctuated

1256
01:08:29,823 --> 01:08:30,591
The 1970s

1257
01:08:30,847 --> 01:08:33,151
It's from a species of least concern earlier on

1258
01:08:33,407 --> 01:08:35,455
The 2500 upgraded too vulnerable

1259
01:08:36,223 --> 01:08:40,575
It's not in dispute how many polar bear population

1260
01:08:40,831 --> 01:08:41,599
In the last decades

1261
01:08:41,855 --> 01:08:42,879
They're so

1262
01:08:43,135 --> 01:08:43,903
A little while back

1263
01:08:44,671 --> 01:08:45,183
But

1264
01:08:47,231 --> 01:08:51,327
Clearly know that it's because of protection that were put in place by conservation groups

1265
01:08:52,863 --> 01:08:53,887
Hunting polar bears

1266
01:08:54,143 --> 01:08:56,959
Or introducing negative environmental pressures in their habitat

1267
01:08:57,983 --> 01:09:00,799
The stabilization of polar bear population is large

1268
01:09:01,055 --> 01:09:01,823
Do the 1970

1269
01:09:02,079 --> 01:09:03,871
P3 International agreement on the conservation

1270
01:09:04,127 --> 01:09:04,639
No polar bears

1271
01:09:05,151 --> 01:09:05,663
Which I think Alex

1272
01:09:05,919 --> 01:09:06,687
Who called world government

1273
01:09:06,943 --> 01:09:07,455
Presumption

1274
01:09:07,711 --> 01:09:09,503
Yeah I always love whenever they

1275
01:09:10,783 --> 01:09:16,927
They're like polar bears

1276
01:09:17,439 --> 01:09:23,583
International law

1277
01:09:25,631 --> 01:09:26,655
When we needed it

1278
01:09:27,167 --> 01:09:28,447
Now we don't

1279
01:09:28,703 --> 01:09:33,823
Another factor to consider is in that. We also put in place a lot of restrictions on commercial steel

1280
01:09:34,335 --> 01:09:35,103
So the food source

1281
01:09:35,359 --> 01:09:36,639
For these Bears dramatically increase

1282
01:09:36,895 --> 01:09:39,455
In the same time. That it was becoming illegal to pump

1283
01:09:40,223 --> 01:09:46,367
Faster with more bears not being more stable food supply giving them the best opportunity to replenish the

1284
01:09:46,623 --> 01:09:47,135
Population

1285
01:09:47,903 --> 01:09:51,487
Polar bear populations of recovered somewhat

1286
01:09:51,743 --> 01:09:54,559
Taken up by all manner of right-wing climate denial punta

1287
01:09:55,327 --> 01:09:57,375
They all use the conception that

1288
01:09:57,631 --> 01:09:58,911
To climate change must be a hoax

1289
01:09:59,167 --> 01:10:03,007
Because as the climate warming the polar bear population is drastically increase

1290
01:10:03,775 --> 01:10:09,919
2007 book by Bjorn lomborg called cool it the skeptical environmentalist

1291
01:10:10,175 --> 01:10:10,943
Guide to global warming

1292
01:10:11,199 --> 01:10:12,735
Oh I know Bjorn lomborg

1293
01:10:14,015 --> 01:10:20,159
We go way back I do the name rang a bell

1294
01:10:20,415 --> 01:10:21,695
Brilliant

1295
01:10:24,511 --> 01:10:25,023
Pull that back

1296
01:10:26,815 --> 01:10:28,351
Okay

1297
01:10:32,959 --> 01:10:33,471
1860s

1298
01:10:33,727 --> 01:10:37,055
Any Citation for that was an article of the LA Times by guy name

1299

1300
01:10:38,591 --> 01:10:44,479
The Journal of the Society of environmental journalists look back at it look back in 2008

1301
01:10:44,735 --> 01:10:45,759
Peace by Peter Dykstra

1302
01:10:46,015 --> 01:10:49,855
I have a solid source for that statistic

1303
01:10:50,111 --> 01:10:53,439
And told dijkstra that quote he understood the number to be widely

1304
01:10:54,463 --> 01:10:59,839
The only other citation given by lomberg was a report by the Soviet Ministry of Agriculture and 19th

1305
01:11:00,095 --> 01:11:00,607
65

1306
01:11:00,863 --> 01:11:04,703
That guessed there were between 5,000 and 8000 polar bears in the Arctic

1307
01:11:05,727 --> 01:11:09,567
To talk to Dexter were quick to point out that our ability to accurately gauge

1308
01:11:09,823 --> 01:11:11,871
The population of polar bears was really bad

1309
01:11:12,127 --> 01:11:13,151
Until at least

1310
01:11:13,663 --> 01:11:16,223
And numbers before that point of really unreliable ask

1311
01:11:17,247 --> 01:11:22,367
One big problem is they polar bears really remote areas and their very hearts

1312
01:11:22,623 --> 01:11:23,135
Since there were

1313
01:11:23,391 --> 01:11:24,927
And so is the entire Arctic

1314
01:11:25,183 --> 01:11:27,231
I don't understand why that would be difficult difficult

1315
01:11:27,743 --> 01:11:32,095
Without

1316
01:11:32,607 --> 01:11:35,935
Technologies developed later it was really a

1317
01:11:36,191 --> 01:11:36,703
Precise game

1318
01:11:36,959 --> 01:11:39,007
The people were doing

1319
01:11:39,263 --> 01:11:40,799
What's the number of marbles in this

1320
01:11:41,055 --> 01:11:43,359
Webster

1321
01:11:43,615 --> 01:11:46,431
Threw those marbles into the into the

1322
01:11:47,455 --> 01:11:49,503
Now guess how many marbles used to be in the

1323
01:11:49,759 --> 01:11:53,087
Challenge

1324
01:11:53,599 --> 01:11:58,975
So people who study the issue state of the populations have recovered in their higher than they were like 40 50 years ago

1325
01:11:59,231 --> 01:12:01,791
But not nearly the jump the climate deniers constant

1326
01:12:02,047 --> 01:12:02,559
Bentley pedal

1327
01:12:02,815 --> 01:12:06,911
And they're also quick to point out that the issue of their recovery has nothing to do with climate change

1328
01:12:07,423 --> 01:12:08,447
All about the international

1329
01:12:08,703 --> 01:12:09,471
Restrictions on

1330
01:12:09,983 --> 01:12:12,031
And the Food Supplies replenishing

1331
01:12:12,287 --> 01:12:13,567
Because of international law

1332
01:12:14,079 --> 01:12:15,359
It is it is them claiming

1333
01:12:17,151 --> 01:12:17,663
They fought

1334
01:12:17,919 --> 01:12:18,431
Chanel 2K

1335
01:12:20,735 --> 01:12:21,247
And now using a

1336
01:12:21,759 --> 01:12:23,295
Propaganda tool to fight tooth and

1337
01:12:23,551 --> 01:12:24,319
Janelle to make sure that

1338
01:12:25,087 --> 01:12:25,855
Absolutely

1339
01:12:26,111 --> 01:12:26,623
F******

1340
01:12:26,879 --> 01:12:28,415
It makes you want to rip your hair

1341
01:12:28,927 --> 01:12:30,975
The problem is a polar bear's do rely on

1342
01:12:31,487 --> 01:12:32,511
As Alex's accurately

1343
01:12:33,535 --> 01:12:39,679
Are projections currently look like by about 2040

1344
01:12:39,935 --> 01:12:44,287
And that likely approximately 30% of the remaining polar bears will die off because of

1345
01:12:44,543 --> 01:12:45,567
Which will lead to

1346
01:12:45,823 --> 01:12:46,335
A big

1347
01:12:48,127 --> 01:12:50,431
The discussion of polar bears is one that's around

1348
01:12:50,687 --> 01:12:52,223
Make it about comes that we are

1349
01:12:52,479 --> 01:12:52,991
Experian

1350
01:12:53,247 --> 01:12:55,295
Not a description of things that are happening now

1351
01:12:55,551 --> 01:12:58,879
Alex is really just pedaling thoroughly misleading

1352
01:13:02,975 --> 01:13:03,743
In order to attack

1353
01:13:06,047 --> 01:13:07,839
Now the last part of that clip

1354
01:13:11,167 --> 01:13:11,679
Suicide because

1355
01:13:11,935 --> 01:13:12,447
Does the climate change

1356
01:13:12,959 --> 01:13:15,263
And I have no idea what specific case Alex

1357
01:13:15,519 --> 01:13:17,055
Talking about

1358
01:13:17,311 --> 01:13:18,847
Young middle schooler killed herself be

1359
01:13:19,103 --> 01:13:19,615
Because of climate change

1360
01:13:20,127 --> 01:13:21,663
I'm not saying that didn't happen

1361
01:13:21,919 --> 01:13:23,711
I believe it's possible that it did

1362
01:13:23,967 --> 01:13:26,527
I can I looked I couldn't find the story

1363
01:13:26,783 --> 01:13:27,551
But he's talking about

1364
01:13:27,807 --> 01:13:28,831
I don't want to say this

1365
01:13:29,087 --> 01:13:31,903
Never happened right in the off chance that it hasn't

1366
01:13:32,159 --> 01:13:37,023
Couldn't figure it out and find the specific story Alex gives no information about it

1367
01:13:37,279 --> 01:13:39,071
Outside of a middle school person

1368
01:13:39,327 --> 01:13:41,375
Suicide climate

1369
01:13:42,655 --> 01:13:44,959
The right-wing talking

1370
01:13:45,471 --> 01:13:45,983
When is about house

1371
01:13:49,311 --> 01:13:50,591
But I can't find one

1372
01:13:50,847 --> 01:13:51,359
Specific person

1373
01:13:51,615 --> 01:13:52,639
Who did

1374
01:13:52,895 --> 01:13:53,663
Commit suicide

1375
01:13:53,919 --> 01:13:54,431
Because of climate

1376
01:13:55,199 --> 01:14:00,575
This year old lawyer David buckle

1377
01:14:01,343 --> 01:14:07,231
Email media Outlets are made unhealthy by fossil fuels

1378
01:14:07,487 --> 01:14:09,535
Early deaths as a result

1379
01:14:09,791 --> 01:14:13,631
My early death by fossil-fuel reflects what we're doing to ourselves

1380
01:14:14,655 --> 01:14:20,287
You left a note for First Responders saying quote I'm David buckle and I just killed myself I fire the protest suicide

1381
01:14:20,543 --> 01:14:22,079
I apologize to you for the map

1382
01:14:23,871 --> 01:14:25,407
David

1383
01:14:25,663 --> 01:14:26,943
Brandon

1384
01:14:27,199 --> 01:14:27,967
Tina's mother

1385
01:14:28,223 --> 01:14:28,991
Against the Sheriff's Department

1386
01:14:29,247 --> 01:14:31,039
Who told Tina's eventual murders

1387
01:14:32,831 --> 01:14:33,599
Accuse them of rape

1388
01:14:33,855 --> 01:14:35,135
Which almost certainly liked his murder

1389
01:14:35,903 --> 01:14:38,463
Arbuckle was a civil rights lawyer well ahead of the Curve

1390
01:14:40,767 --> 01:14:43,071
At a protest suicide was absolutely not the result of

1391
01:14:45,887 --> 01:14:46,911
Published

1392
01:14:48,447 --> 01:14:48,959
Climate change

1393
01:14:49,215 --> 01:14:52,287
Connection between climate change and suicide

1394
01:14:52,799 --> 01:14:55,103
But it might be inclined to draw the wrong

1395
01:14:55,359 --> 01:14:55,871
Conclusions

1396
01:14:56,383 --> 01:14:59,967
Marshall Burke was the lead researcher and you found that there is a link between

1397
01:15:00,223 --> 01:15:01,503
Temperatures in suicide rate

1398
01:15:02,015 --> 01:15:05,087
So the conclusion was it if consistent temperatures are higher than you

1399
01:15:05,855 --> 01:15:06,367
Increase suicide

1400
01:15:07,391 --> 01:15:13,535
It's easy to take a poorly-written headline about this study and Come Away with the wrong idea that this is a study Lincoln climb

1401
01:15:13,791 --> 01:15:14,559
A change in suicide

1402
01:15:15,327 --> 01:15:17,631
If you don't read the articles you might assume the climate change

1403
01:15:17,887 --> 01:15:18,655
Beers are licked

1404
01:15:18,911 --> 01:15:19,935
Play suicide by this

1405
01:15:20,191 --> 01:15:20,703
Just not the case

1406
01:15:21,471 --> 01:15:24,287
I found that crop damage caused by temperature

1407
01:15:24,543 --> 01:15:25,055
Increases is

1408
01:15:25,311 --> 01:15:26,847
Is associated with elevated suicide rates

1409
01:15:27,359 --> 01:15:30,431
India so there are definite things to be worried about

1410
01:15:31,199 --> 01:15:32,735
That said I don't know what case out

1411
01:15:32,991 --> 01:15:33,503
Is referring to

1412
01:15:33,759 --> 01:15:34,527
And I don't

1413
01:15:34,783 --> 01:15:37,855
I don't think whatever he's talking about is a large phenomenon

1414
01:15:38,367 --> 01:15:39,647
That's it going on

1415
01:15:39,903 --> 01:15:41,183
I think there's other conversation

1416
01:15:41,439 --> 01:15:42,207
The people are having

1417
01:15:42,463 --> 01:15:43,231
And other insta

1418
01:15:44,255 --> 01:15:45,023
But Alex's

1419
01:15:45,535 --> 01:15:46,047
Clearly

1420
01:15:46,559 --> 01:15:48,607
Well there's

1421
01:15:48,863 --> 01:15:49,375
We always say we

1422
01:15:49,887 --> 01:15:50,399
Correlation

1423
01:15:51,167 --> 01:15:51,679
Causation

1424
01:15:51,935 --> 01:15:52,447
We always say

1425
01:15:54,239 --> 01:15:55,263
I think that's

1426
01:15:56,799 --> 01:15:59,615
As far as I know what the

1427
01:15:59,871 --> 01:16:00,383
Point is space

1428
01:16:03,199 --> 01:16:03,967
I don't know if it says

1429
01:16:04,223 --> 01:16:04,991
Survey

1430
01:16:06,783 --> 01:16:07,807
But a large

1431
01:16:08,063 --> 01:16:08,831
Number of people on

1432
01:16:09,087 --> 01:16:09,599
Under the age of 20

1433
01:16:10,111 --> 01:16:10,623
Weather now

1434
01:16:13,183 --> 01:16:13,695
About climb

1435
01:16:18,815 --> 01:16:20,095
It for them of course.

1436
01:16:20,863 --> 01:16:21,375
From

1437
01:16:21,631 --> 01:16:22,655
Talk to your therapist

1438
01:16:22,911 --> 01:16:23,935
Crest about how there's a

1439
01:16:24,447 --> 01:16:25,215
Fear about what the few

1440
01:16:31,871 --> 01:16:33,407
If you were to do it like Alex

1441
01:16:33,919 --> 01:16:35,199
Probably isn't

1442
01:16:35,455 --> 01:16:40,575
Therapy

1443
01:16:40,831 --> 01:16:45,439
Play you know the fears that Alex has introduced into their lives

1444
01:16:46,463 --> 01:16:48,255
I don't know if he's just a big old hypocrite

1445
01:16:48,511 --> 01:16:50,303
Therapist wouldn't be like

1446
01:16:50,815 --> 01:16:52,095
Now that's a legitimate fear

1447
01:16:53,887 --> 01:16:58,495
I don't know I just think there's a lot of

1448
01:16:59,007 --> 01:17:01,311
And there's just a load of b******* in it

1449
01:17:01,823 --> 01:17:02,335
It's really

1450
01:17:03,103 --> 01:17:03,871
It's pretty crazy

1451
01:17:04,639 --> 01:17:05,407
So when you see these things

1452
01:17:05,663 --> 01:17:07,711
He's like really direct misrepresentation

1453
01:17:08,735 --> 01:17:09,759
Past off

1454
01:17:10,015 --> 01:17:12,319
It makes this next clip even more

1455
01:17:13,343 --> 01:17:15,135
But I think at this clip is really just like

1456
01:17:16,415 --> 01:17:18,719
Describe it other than like this show is a parody of

1457
01:17:19,743 --> 01:17:23,327
Do you know like what you do when people try and make fun of the Juggalos can't

1458
01:17:23,583 --> 01:17:24,863
Yeah makes fun of that

1459
01:17:25,375 --> 01:17:26,911
Damn braces

1460
01:17:27,423 --> 01:17:27,935
You can't do it

1461
01:17:28,191 --> 01:17:29,215
I always feel like I can't

1462
01:17:29,471 --> 01:17:30,751
Fun of this clip

1463
01:17:31,007 --> 01:17:33,055
I don't know what else

1464
01:17:33,311 --> 01:17:34,079
I think it's ridiculous

1465
01:17:34,847 --> 01:17:37,151
Please don't forget

1466
01:17:37,663 --> 01:17:42,015
We are bringing Black Friday

1467
01:17:46,367 --> 01:17:49,951
Percent off all preparedness water filters air filters

1468
01:17:50,207 --> 01:17:53,023
Troubleshoot

1469
01:17:53,791 --> 01:17:54,559
Look at that

1470
01:17:57,375 --> 01:18:03,519
A free shipping

1471
01:18:05,823 --> 01:18:11,967
We talked about like the Easter sale yeah I got nothing for two months early on Black Friday

1472
01:18:12,223 --> 01:18:13,759
That's just beyond

1473
01:18:14,015 --> 01:18:19,135
Yeah

1474
01:18:19,391 --> 01:18:20,927
Defeat what you

1475
01:18:21,183 --> 01:18:27,327
Commercialize while at the same time being like

1476
01:18:27,583 --> 01:18:29,631
Are Black Friday sales 2 months

1477
01:18:29,887 --> 01:18:30,399
Early

1478
01:18:37,823 --> 01:18:40,127
Intuit

1479
01:18:40,383 --> 01:18:46,527
Is commercialism

1480
01:18:49,343 --> 01:18:54,719
I got it

1481
01:18:57,023 --> 01:19:02,911
I don't have many Juggalo reference

1482
01:19:07,007 --> 01:19:07,519
Fluoride bagel

1483
01:19:07,775 --> 01:19:10,591
Alex has

1484
01:19:12,127 --> 01:19:13,919
On the show to talk about 5

1485
01:19:15,199 --> 01:19:19,295
She is an employee of Infowars who went out to the climate protest in Austin

1486
01:19:19,551 --> 01:19:20,575
Aaron's

1487
01:19:20,831 --> 01:19:21,343
Tristan footage

1488
01:19:21,855 --> 01:19:23,391
I bet they're going to go out

1489
01:19:23,647 --> 01:19:25,183
Very important talk about that

1490
01:19:26,463 --> 01:19:27,743
They're not important at all

1491
01:19:27,999 --> 01:19:31,327
But I do have one thought and that is that I think Savannah Hernandez

1492
01:19:31,583 --> 01:19:32,607
This is unfortunately

1493
01:19:33,119 --> 01:19:35,423
Very similar to everyone else

1494
01:19:35,935 --> 01:19:36,703
Possibly kind of

1495
01:19:37,215 --> 01:19:41,055
Because she's talking about how she was afraid of climate change

1496
01:19:41,311 --> 01:19:46,943
When she was younger people that she uses to describe what she was afraid of

1497
01:20:08,959 --> 01:20:15,104
2012 was not necessarily about climate change apocalypse

1498
01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:15,872
All the signs

1499
01:20:16,896 --> 01:20:23,040
Coming out and saying guys we got to prepare we're all going to drown in 2012

1500
01:20:23,296 --> 01:20:28,416
You talkin about the day after tomorrow that like Faster movie

1501
01:20:28,672 --> 01:20:29,184
That was what

1502
01:20:29,952 --> 01:20:35,840
2004's of the remember one that was talking about that

1503
01:20:36,096 --> 01:20:36,608
2012

1504
01:20:36,864 --> 01:20:38,912
Yeah

1505
01:20:39,168 --> 01:20:43,008
The cultural fears about 2012 weren't driven by let's take

1506
01:20:43,264 --> 01:20:49,408
As much as they were people like aliens people

1507
01:20:50,176 --> 01:20:52,480
Alex Jones nothing Fair he wasn't

1508
01:20:53,760 --> 01:20:55,808
That is

1509
01:20:56,064 --> 01:20:56,576
Great

1510
01:20:56,832 --> 01:20:58,112
Albert very good

1511
01:20:58,368 --> 01:20:59,136
Distillation of

1512
01:20:59,392 --> 01:20:59,904
What it takes

1513
01:21:00,160 --> 01:21:00,672
To be good

1514
01:21:00,928 --> 01:21:01,696
Infowars employees

1515
01:21:02,720 --> 01:21:06,816
Be afraid of something and then find a movie and then call the movie fake

1516
01:21:07,072 --> 01:21:08,096
And now you don't have to

1517
01:21:09,376 --> 01:21:09,888
Yeah

1518
01:21:11,424 --> 01:21:16,288
Just had like oh yeah you know what if you're listening to her and not really paying attention or know all that much

1519
01:21:16,544 --> 01:21:19,616
You'd be like we're afraid back then

1520
01:21:19,872 --> 01:21:21,664
True

1521
01:21:21,920 --> 01:21:28,064
Obviously climate change

1522
01:21:28,320 --> 01:21:33,184
Bored

1523
01:21:33,440 --> 01:21:34,720
For that one so you don't want to bring that up

1524
01:21:34,976 --> 01:21:35,488
On the show

1525
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:39,584
It's been wrong about predictions

1526
01:21:41,632 --> 01:21:43,168
Actually like

1527
01:21:43,424 --> 01:21:43,936
I don't know that one

1528
01:21:44,192 --> 01:21:44,960
Might have been right

1529
01:21:45,216 --> 01:21:47,008
Scientist predict super hurricane

1530
01:21:48,032 --> 01:21:54,176
On the list

1531
01:21:56,480 --> 01:22:01,344
So great didn't even know there was a category 5 on the third Category 5 of this year

1532
01:22:01,600 --> 01:22:07,744
The other one I don't care too much about that

1533
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:11,840
Service of building up his idea that to everyone who talks about climate change

1534
01:22:12,096 --> 01:22:12,608
Lies

1535
01:22:12,864 --> 01:22:13,632
To you about it

1536
01:22:15,424 --> 01:22:18,496
Uses a specific example

1537
01:22:18,752 --> 01:22:20,032
Little unfair

1538
01:22:21,056 --> 01:22:23,872
National Geographic

1539
01:22:24,384 --> 01:22:30,528
They took a picture of this

1540
01:22:32,576 --> 01:22:33,856
Actually States

1541
01:22:34,368 --> 01:22:34,880
So

1542
01:22:35,136 --> 01:22:35,904
What

1543
01:22:36,672 --> 01:22:38,464
She's kind of misrepresenting things here a little bit

1544
01:22:38,720 --> 01:22:39,232
41

1545
01:22:39,488 --> 01:22:40,000
Two things

1546
01:22:40,256 --> 01:22:41,280
National Geographic took

1547
01:22:41,536 --> 01:22:42,304
The picture and stuff and

1548
01:22:43,584 --> 01:22:44,352
What happened here

1549
01:22:44,608 --> 01:22:49,984
Was it a photographer named Cristina mittermeier and found

1550
01:22:50,496 --> 01:22:51,520
Captured footage

1551
01:22:52,288 --> 01:22:56,640
Expedition was explicit as explained

1552
01:22:56,896 --> 01:23:00,480
Photographer Paul nicklen

1553
01:23:00,736 --> 01:23:02,016
Communicate the urgency of climate

1554
01:23:02,784 --> 01:23:04,832
Documenting its effect on wildlife

1555
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:09,696
With this imagery thought we try to help people imagine what the future of climate change

1556
01:23:09,952 --> 01:23:10,464
Might look like

1557
01:23:11,232 --> 01:23:14,816
Neither She nor Nick ever explicitly tied the Bears condition to climate change

1558
01:23:15,328 --> 01:23:21,472
That was done by National Geographic when they picked up the footage and attach the words quote this is what climate change looks like to

1559
01:23:21,728 --> 01:23:22,240
The video

1560
01:23:22,496 --> 01:23:24,288
Mittermeier responded to the backlash

1561
01:23:24,544 --> 01:23:27,616
The video caused from climate denial list fired

1562
01:23:27,872 --> 01:23:29,920
Set the caption was probably going a little too far

1563
01:23:30,176 --> 01:23:31,456
And even National Geographic

1564
01:23:31,712 --> 01:23:32,224
Get that as much

1565
01:23:32,480 --> 01:23:33,504
Any flight retract

1566
01:23:34,528 --> 01:23:36,832
But that's far from saying that they are just making

1567
01:23:37,088 --> 01:23:37,600
Stop up

1568
01:23:37,856 --> 01:23:39,648
It was only a recognition that they could

1569
01:23:39,904 --> 01:23:41,440
Prove the climate change

1570
01:23:41,696 --> 01:23:43,488
To do with the specific bear starvation

1571
01:23:43,744 --> 01:23:46,048
Which was never claim being made by the photographer

1572
01:23:47,584 --> 01:23:49,120
But you know what that's kind of

1573
01:23:49,376 --> 01:23:49,888
The point

1574
01:23:50,144 --> 01:23:52,448
Inventor Myers explanation post about this

1575
01:23:52,704 --> 01:23:53,216
She says quote

1576
01:23:53,472 --> 01:23:55,264
I can't say that this bear was starving

1577
01:23:55,520 --> 01:23:56,032
Because of climate

1578
01:23:56,544 --> 01:24:00,640
But I do know the polar bears rely on the ice on Wichita

1579
01:24:01,152 --> 01:24:02,688
Fast warming Arctic means it's

1580
01:24:02,944 --> 01:24:03,968
Sea ice is disappearing

1581
01:24:04,480 --> 01:24:06,528
Increasingly longer periods of time each year

1582
01:24:06,784 --> 01:24:12,160
That means many more bears will get stranded on land where they can pursue the seals walruses and whales that there are their prey

1583
01:24:12,416 --> 01:24:14,208
And where they will slowly starve to death

1584
01:24:14,976 --> 01:24:21,120
The caption implied more than anyone knew about the specific bear but the specific bear wasn't evocative realistic portrait

1585
01:24:21,376 --> 01:24:21,888
What the future holds

1586
01:24:22,144 --> 01:24:23,424
A polar bears

1587
01:24:24,192 --> 01:24:25,728
If anything

1588
01:24:25,984 --> 01:24:31,104
Sloppy editorial work but absolutely not a guy at all climate change activist

1589
01:24:31,360 --> 01:24:32,128
A conservationist

1590
01:24:32,384 --> 01:24:34,432
Are just making s*** up to scare kids or whatever

1591
01:24:36,480 --> 01:24:37,248
Just a indica

1592
01:24:38,784 --> 01:24:40,064
Fat that whole thing

1593
01:24:40,320 --> 01:24:40,832
Have like

1594
01:24:41,600 --> 01:24:43,136
Look you're misunderstanding

1595
01:24:43,392 --> 01:24:44,160
Everything in your make

1596
01:24:45,184 --> 01:24:46,720
Faith argument towards us

1597
01:24:47,488 --> 01:24:48,512
Maybe you have the

1598
01:24:48,768 --> 01:24:49,280
Tennis

1599
01:24:49,536 --> 01:24:50,304
Ferris

1600
01:24:51,328 --> 01:24:52,352
Sliver of a point

1601
01:24:52,608 --> 01:24:53,376
Still we're just going

1602
01:24:53,632 --> 01:24:54,400
Can you come out and words

1603
01:24:54,912 --> 01:24:55,424
We don't want to do

1604
01:24:55,936 --> 01:24:56,960
We just don't want to fight

1605
01:24:57,216 --> 01:24:57,728
This b*******

1606
01:24:57,984 --> 01:24:59,008
Fine we can't

1607
01:25:00,544 --> 01:25:01,568
Polar bear is dying

1608
01:25:04,640 --> 01:25:05,664
Never going to stop saying the

1609
01:25:05,920 --> 01:25:06,944
That's what they should have said was

1610
01:25:07,200 --> 01:25:07,712
Go fuc yourself

1611
01:25:08,480 --> 01:25:14,624
Right that's what I ever

1612
01:25:14,880 --> 01:25:18,976
I also see the side of National Geographic erring on the side of like

1613
01:25:20,256 --> 01:25:21,024
Let's

1614
01:25:21,280 --> 01:25:22,560
Let's Pretend are

1615
01:25:22,816 --> 01:25:24,608
Our standards

1616
01:25:26,144 --> 01:25:27,680
It's not that I don't under

1617
01:25:28,192 --> 01:25:28,704
And where they're coming

1618
01:25:29,728 --> 01:25:32,288
It's absolutely not that and it's not even that I

1619
01:25:32,800 --> 01:25:33,824
Sara Lee disagree with the

1620
01:25:36,896 --> 01:25:37,664
But with this

1621
01:25:37,920 --> 01:25:38,432
Bulshit

1622
01:25:38,944 --> 01:25:40,992
That's why we lose the messaging

1623
01:25:43,808 --> 01:25:44,576
Over again

1624
01:25:45,088 --> 01:25:47,392
We are not going to climate

1625
01:25:48,160 --> 01:25:48,672
Because of

1626
01:25:49,952 --> 01:25:52,768
Bunch of s*** but we talked about this

1627
01:25:53,024 --> 01:25:53,792
All the time

1628
01:25:54,304 --> 01:25:54,816
If you and I

1629
01:25:55,584 --> 01:25:56,864
Have a slight disagreement

1630
01:25:58,656 --> 01:25:59,680
May fight you emotional

1631
01:26:02,496 --> 01:26:05,568
People like National Geographic need to uphold the standard

1632
01:26:06,080 --> 01:26:07,872
Hey we need equally

1633
01:26:08,384 --> 01:26:09,920
Not equally large cuz

1634
01:26:10,944 --> 01:26:11,456
Because largest

1635
01:26:11,712 --> 01:26:12,736
National Geographic

1636
01:26:14,272 --> 01:26:16,320
Making that go f*** yourself

1637
01:26:16,832 --> 01:26:21,696
National Geographic

1638
01:26:22,976 --> 01:26:25,792
You know people like you can say those things

1639
01:26:26,048 --> 01:26:26,560
Can be a messenger

1640
01:26:30,912 --> 01:26:31,936
Can play by

1641
01:26:32,448 --> 01:26:36,544
Editorial standards

1642
01:26:37,056 --> 01:26:39,104
Or actually yourself

1643
01:26:39,360 --> 01:26:39,872
And we just have

1644
01:26:40,640 --> 01:26:41,152
Editorial Sandra

1645
01:26:43,968 --> 01:26:45,504
Abu star go f*** yourself

1646
01:26:47,040 --> 01:26:47,552
That's your mission

1647
01:26:48,320 --> 01:26:50,368
So earlier I thought

1648
01:26:50,624 --> 01:26:53,952
Sarcastic

1649
01:26:54,208 --> 01:26:59,072
I was saying earlier that I thought that I was basing they've admitted that they're just trying to

1650
01:26:59,328 --> 01:27:02,400
Are you on the comments made by Obama's former head of

1651
01:27:02,656 --> 01:27:03,936
McCarthy

1652
01:27:04,192 --> 01:27:06,240
Saying that they could easily be taken out of

1653
01:27:07,008 --> 01:27:09,056
Seems like Alakazam most

1654
01:27:09,568 --> 01:27:11,872
Had all of the pieces in place

1655
01:27:12,128 --> 01:27:13,152
But you know what

1656
01:27:13,408 --> 01:27:14,432
I was giving him

1657
01:27:14,688 --> 01:27:16,224
Way too f****** much credit

1658
01:27:21,600 --> 01:27:24,160
But later in the show he reveals what he's talking about it like

1659
01:27:24,672 --> 01:27:28,000
I can't believe I thought he read an article

1660
01:27:28,512 --> 01:27:29,280
Because you know what

1661
01:27:29,792 --> 01:27:33,888
It's just a random person in Savannah Hernandez report

1662
01:27:42,848 --> 01:27:44,896
Irreversible

1663
01:27:55,648 --> 01:27:56,416
Sometimes

1664
01:28:05,888 --> 01:28:07,680
This is what he's basing it on just

1665
01:28:07,936 --> 01:28:12,032
Brand of people that interviewed at the climate change rally

1666
01:28:14,336 --> 01:28:18,176
I thought he was talking about the former head of the EPA and lying about her

1667
01:28:18,432 --> 01:28:24,576
Just random man on the street s*** dude the leaders are admitting all yeah

1668
01:28:28,416 --> 01:28:29,952
What the f***

1669
01:28:30,208 --> 01:28:31,488
Describe

1670
01:28:31,744 --> 01:28:35,328
Flimsy the s*** is

1671
01:28:36,352 --> 01:28:36,864
From

1672
01:28:37,120 --> 01:28:37,632
The right way

1673
01:28:39,936 --> 01:28:40,448
The climate March

1674
01:28:41,216 --> 01:28:42,496
What about Goes My Mind

1675
01:28:42,752 --> 01:28:43,520
And is literally

1676
01:28:43,776 --> 01:28:44,544
Every answer that

1677
01:28:45,312 --> 01:28:46,080
Is actually very real

1678
01:28:46,336 --> 01:28:46,848
Reasonable

1679
01:28:47,104 --> 01:28:48,128
Intelligent and they're like

1680
01:28:48,384 --> 01:28:49,408
Look at these dumb dumb

1681
01:28:49,920 --> 01:28:54,272
They don't even bother with

1682
01:28:54,528 --> 01:28:55,296
First news after that like

1683
01:28:56,832 --> 01:28:57,344
I

1684
01:28:57,600 --> 01:29:00,672
Irreversible after

1685
01:29:00,928 --> 01:29:01,696
10 or 12 years but

1686
01:29:01,952 --> 01:29:03,488
That is the data on it and

1687
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:05,280
Sure it is scared

1688
01:29:05,536 --> 01:29:06,304
But you know what you need

1689
01:29:06,816 --> 01:29:07,584
Scare people

1690
01:29:07,840 --> 01:29:08,864
To force them into

1691
01:29:09,632 --> 01:29:10,400
And I mean that is

1692
01:29:10,656 --> 01:29:11,936
That's something that everybody knows

1693
01:29:24,992 --> 01:29:26,016
Great

1694
01:29:26,528 --> 01:29:29,088
When I was listening to this

1695
01:29:29,344 --> 01:29:29,856
Report

1696
01:29:30,112 --> 01:29:30,624
If you filed

1697
01:29:31,392 --> 01:29:33,184
Why is she getting straight answers

1698
01:29:35,232 --> 01:29:37,792
Climate change real

1699
01:29:38,048 --> 01:29:39,584
She doesn't have info

1700
01:29:41,120 --> 01:29:42,656
Well so she heard a lot of facts

1701
01:29:43,168 --> 01:29:43,936
Certificate

1702
01:29:46,240 --> 01:29:47,264
Citizens

1703
01:29:47,520 --> 01:29:48,032
Action 7 News

1704
01:29:52,640 --> 01:29:54,432
She's with Action 7 News

1705
01:29:54,688 --> 01:29:56,736
Manipulative

1706
01:29:57,248 --> 01:30:00,832
Alex knows that when is reporters go out to places they'll rightly get yelled at

1707
01:30:01,088 --> 01:30:07,232
Flipped Offenbach absolutely with always going to happen

1708
01:30:07,488 --> 01:30:08,000
With that

1709
01:30:08,512 --> 01:30:10,560
Don't get me wrong it still serves a purpose

1710
01:30:11,072 --> 01:30:13,376
He knows that when he sends Kaitlin Bennett out for him

1711
01:30:13,888 --> 01:30:16,704
At her and tell her to f*** off

1712
01:30:23,616 --> 01:30:26,432
People questions and they all just go cut girl at me

1713
01:30:26,688 --> 01:30:30,272
She's a lightning rod for that kind of response cuz most people know who she is

1714
01:30:30,528 --> 01:30:33,088
No interest to do much more than laughing at her

1715
01:30:33,344 --> 01:30:36,928
And the best way to monetize that reaction is selling victimhood narrative

1716
01:30:37,952 --> 01:30:39,232
You just do that about everything

1717
01:30:40,256 --> 01:30:41,536
Like what the climate protest

1718
01:30:41,792 --> 01:30:44,864
It's a little off Target to just paint the protesters as a rabble-rousing

1719
01:30:45,120 --> 01:30:45,888
In Crowd of rude people

1720
01:30:46,400 --> 01:30:48,704
That's all just really hunt on

1721
01:30:51,008 --> 01:30:55,104
Everyone else is rude

1722
01:30:55,360 --> 01:30:58,688
How to run the risk of the audience eventually catching on and realizing

1723
01:30:58,944 --> 01:31:00,736
Just saw the public response to you

1724
01:31:03,296 --> 01:31:08,160
Can't really do much in public anymore he's sort of cross that recognizability

1725
01:31:08,416 --> 01:31:10,464
Threshold so people don't really respond well to

1726
01:31:10,976 --> 01:31:14,048
Like children

1727
01:31:14,816 --> 01:31:18,656
The perfect solution is a new woman reporter who no one recognizes

1728
01:31:18,912 --> 01:31:20,960
Is pretending she doesn't work for Infowars

1729
01:31:21,472 --> 01:31:23,776
No one has any idea who Savannah Hernandez

1730
01:31:24,032 --> 01:31:26,336
An Action 7 News sound so bland is to be

1731
01:31:26,592 --> 01:31:27,360
Probably real

1732
01:31:27,616 --> 01:31:30,688
And that she's able to ask people questions and record their answers under false

1733
01:31:30,944 --> 01:31:31,456
Pretenses

1734
01:31:31,968 --> 01:31:35,296
Most of the people would not talk to her if they knew that you worked at Infowars

1735
01:31:35,552 --> 01:31:37,856
Both she and Alex are fully aware of it

1736
01:31:38,368 --> 01:31:39,392
What they're doing is like a hidden

1737
01:31:39,648 --> 01:31:42,208
Prank show but with no reveal

1738
01:31:42,464 --> 01:31:42,976
Can we do

1739
01:31:43,488 --> 01:31:44,512
Wells interesting

1740
01:31:44,768 --> 01:31:48,864
Okay there we go according to the ethics section of journalists. Org

1741
01:31:49,120 --> 01:31:50,912
For the news to have credibility

1742
01:31:51,168 --> 01:31:52,192
Ethical Lenoir News gas

1743
01:31:52,960 --> 01:31:56,288
They go on to say quote most news organizations agree that journalist

1744
01:31:56,544 --> 01:32:01,152
Generally should identify themselves a news organization in the course of routine newsgathering

1745
01:32:01,664 --> 01:32:04,736
It is not appropriate to mislead or deceive someone you're interviewing

1746
01:32:04,992 --> 01:32:06,784
Subterfuge

1747
01:32:08,320 --> 01:32:12,160
The general exception to this guidelines when someone is doing investigative reporting

1748
01:32:12,416 --> 01:32:13,184
And they're Undercover

1749
01:32:13,952 --> 01:32:17,280
But generally speaking the guidelines on that are really

1750
01:32:17,792 --> 01:32:21,120
Based on like is it appropriate is the news that you're Gathering

1751
01:32:21,376 --> 01:32:23,424
So crucial for the public to know about

1752
01:32:23,680 --> 01:32:25,728
That it justifies go over the cover

1753
01:32:26,240 --> 01:32:27,008
Is it is it

1754
01:32:27,264 --> 01:32:30,848
You can only get this by going undercover is there a safety

1755
01:32:31,360 --> 01:32:33,152
I don't think the meat packing

1756
01:32:33,408 --> 01:32:33,920
Industry was going

1757
01:32:34,176 --> 01:32:35,200
Going to tell up to

1758
01:32:35,456 --> 01:32:36,224
Sinclair everything on

1759
01:32:36,736 --> 01:32:39,040
The update on the up-and-up it's probably not

1760
01:32:39,296 --> 01:32:40,320
On the updating Upton if you

1761
01:32:41,088 --> 01:32:41,600
I want

1762
01:32:41,856 --> 01:32:44,160
But if it's wants to play it

1763
01:32:44,416 --> 01:32:44,928
I guess that's

1764
01:32:45,184 --> 01:32:48,512
It says something deeply pathetic about the state of things

1765
01:32:49,024 --> 01:32:50,304
They're so not credible

1766
01:32:50,816 --> 01:32:52,864
So disliked University mop

1767
01:32:54,400 --> 01:32:57,472
Republic protest

1768
01:32:57,728 --> 01:32:59,264
They have to conceal their identity

1769
01:32:59,776 --> 01:33:00,544
Amazing

1770
01:33:00,800 --> 01:33:01,568
That is bad

1771
01:33:02,336 --> 01:33:03,360
Daddy's back

1772
01:33:07,712 --> 01:33:10,784
Sunglasses and Charlie Chaplin

1773
01:33:11,040 --> 01:33:11,808
In order to go out and

1774
01:33:12,320 --> 01:33:15,648
In order to adjust normal interview go

1775
01:33:15,904 --> 01:33:18,208
You have to resort to

1776
01:33:18,464 --> 01:33:19,232
Sinclair levels of

1777
01:33:20,256 --> 01:33:20,768
Deception

1778
01:33:21,792 --> 01:33:22,304
I mean

1779
01:33:22,560 --> 01:33:23,072
Unseemly

1780
01:33:24,608 --> 01:33:25,376
That's not good

1781
01:33:32,032 --> 01:33:32,800
News Operation

1782
01:33:33,568 --> 01:33:35,104
If it was subjected to that kind of scrutiny

1783
01:33:35,360 --> 01:33:36,384
All this s*** they do be

1784
01:33:36,640 --> 01:33:38,176
So laughably disqualifying

1785
01:33:38,688 --> 01:33:41,504
Pretending you work somewhere else to go do man-on-the-street interviews

1786
01:33:42,016 --> 01:33:43,296
The f*** out of here

1787
01:33:47,648 --> 01:33:49,952
Rur

1788
01:33:50,464 --> 01:33:50,976
The response

1789
01:33:51,488 --> 01:33:52,000
Is this app

1790
01:33:52,512 --> 01:33:53,536
Because you're using

1791
01:33:53,792 --> 01:33:54,304
Deception

1792
01:33:54,560 --> 01:33:55,072
To ask

1793
01:33:55,584 --> 01:33:56,096
Right

1794
01:33:56,352 --> 01:33:58,656
So buy a by default all of this stuff

1795
01:33:58,912 --> 01:34:00,192
You have to do is like well

1796
01:34:00,448 --> 01:34:00,960
Throw it out

1797
01:34:01,216 --> 01:34:04,032
Even though these answers if the people give are innocuous

1798
01:34:05,312 --> 01:34:06,592
Financers to question

1799
01:34:07,360 --> 01:34:08,384
It's still like

1800
01:34:08,640 --> 01:34:09,408
You do

1801
01:34:09,920 --> 01:34:11,968
You're lying to retrieve that information

1802
01:34:12,224 --> 01:34:13,504
That's interesting because

1803
01:34:13,760 --> 01:34:14,272
It's almost

1804
01:34:16,320 --> 01:34:17,600
It's almost the inverse

1805
01:34:18,112 --> 01:34:19,136
I would I would say

1806
01:34:19,904 --> 01:34:20,928
Like if you were

1807
01:34:21,184 --> 01:34:23,488
If you are coming at me with an Infowars micro

1808
01:34:24,256 --> 01:34:25,280
I would never give you

1809
01:34:27,584 --> 01:34:30,656
So the only way

1810
01:34:31,424 --> 01:34:32,960
The only honest

1811
01:34:33,728 --> 01:34:35,264
Answer is going to come from Jessie

1812
01:34:35,776 --> 01:34:38,080
They're only going to get

1813
01:34:38,336 --> 01:34:43,712
In response to an alternate reality

1814
01:34:43,968 --> 01:34:46,016
Deceptive when Gathering the information

1815
01:34:46,272 --> 01:34:46,784
India

1816
01:34:47,040 --> 01:34:50,368
Interviews and then be further deceptive and how you present

1817
01:34:50,880 --> 01:34:51,392
Responses that

1818
01:34:53,952 --> 01:34:56,512
At the point where

1819
01:34:56,768 --> 01:34:58,304
For Infowars to actually get a

1820
01:34:59,584 --> 01:35:02,912
Can answer from someone they have to go full under cover journalist

1821
01:35:03,936 --> 01:35:04,448
Great

1822
01:35:04,960 --> 01:35:11,104
That doesn't bode well

1823
01:35:11,872 --> 01:35:15,968
Everyone's disposable once they are recognizable

1824
01:35:16,224 --> 01:35:17,248
That is really in

1825
01:35:17,760 --> 01:35:18,528
They have gone

1826
01:35:18,784 --> 01:35:19,296
Through that

1827
01:35:19,552 --> 01:35:21,600
The abyss no longer looks back at them

1828
01:35:21,856 --> 01:35:23,648
Like hanging out with you

1829
01:35:24,160 --> 01:35:30,048
I will bring them

1830
01:35:30,560 --> 01:35:34,400
Stealth Destroyer amazing

1831
01:35:34,912 --> 01:35:38,752
He's that goes viral that ruins her usability in any other video

1832
01:35:39,264 --> 01:35:40,544
People start to notice

1833
01:35:40,800 --> 01:35:44,640
Owen Shroyer can't really do is man on the street B because everyone reposted the videos

1834
01:35:45,152 --> 01:35:45,664
The kid

1835
01:35:45,920 --> 01:35:52,064
Telling him to f*** off without anyone

1836
01:35:52,320 --> 01:35:54,880
Ford

1837
01:36:00,256 --> 01:36:05,632
USA

1838
01:36:06,912 --> 01:36:08,448
Like anybody that he has

1839
01:36:09,216 --> 01:36:10,496
Has to stay obscure

1840
01:36:10,752 --> 01:36:13,824
There is a ceiling to the amount of attention they can get

1841
01:36:14,080 --> 01:36:15,360
Which is self-defeating

1842
01:36:19,456 --> 01:36:22,016
Getting popular blows their cover

1843
01:36:22,272 --> 01:36:23,040
It's like that

1844
01:36:23,296 --> 01:36:24,064
I'm doing one of those

1845
01:36:24,320 --> 01:36:28,928
What are those interviews with somebody who doesn't want to be identified so they're in all black and they

1846
01:36:29,184 --> 01:36:30,208
They've got their voice modulator

1847
01:36:30,720 --> 01:36:34,816
The interviewer is the one who said all black with a voice modulator

1848
01:36:35,072 --> 01:36:38,144
Walking to the to the door opener does not look good for the future

1849
01:36:38,912 --> 01:36:41,728
So Alex

1850
01:36:41,984 --> 01:36:42,752
But it's very uncompelling

1851
01:36:43,264 --> 01:36:44,032
Think we've hit the lot of them

1852
01:36:44,288 --> 01:36:47,872
Alex

1853
01:36:48,640 --> 01:36:49,152
At this point

1854
01:36:50,944 --> 01:36:51,968
He's brought on Jewel-Osco

1855
01:36:53,248 --> 01:36:56,832
Get the cows in there which is interesting because he's someone who doesn't like Trump

1856
01:36:57,600 --> 01:36:59,392
Someone who has wings

1857
01:36:59,648 --> 01:37:00,672
His influence on Alex

1858
01:37:00,928 --> 01:37:01,952
Amadeus

1859
01:37:02,208 --> 01:37:02,976
Alex

1860
01:37:03,232 --> 01:37:03,744
Like used to be

1861
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:04,768
You far more of an ex

1862
01:37:05,536 --> 01:37:07,328
And him coming around

1863
01:37:07,584 --> 01:37:08,864
Does

1864
01:37:09,888 --> 01:37:10,912
The Alex is more willing

1865
01:37:11,424 --> 01:37:11,936
Criticized

1866
01:37:15,520 --> 01:37:18,080
Moving on anything

1867
01:37:20,128 --> 01:37:21,920
He is a rock

1868
01:37:22,432 --> 01:37:23,712
Give someone who is

1869
01:37:23,968 --> 01:37:24,736
Very dead

1870
01:37:25,504 --> 01:37:26,016
His ways

1871
01:37:27,552 --> 01:37:28,832
Has his own business

1872
01:37:29,088 --> 01:37:31,648
The world affairs brief or whatever

1873
01:37:33,440 --> 01:37:34,720
Comfortable

1874
01:37:36,256 --> 01:37:39,328
Alex is bringing him around I heard him on episode

1875
01:37:39,584 --> 01:37:40,608
A couple weeks back to

1876
01:37:41,120 --> 01:37:43,168
And he been gone for

1877
01:37:43,424 --> 01:37:43,936
A bit

1878
01:37:44,192 --> 01:37:45,472
Yeah I can't remember the last time

1879
01:37:45,984 --> 01:37:46,496
Talk about a present

1880
01:37:49,056 --> 01:37:50,336
Periodically

1881
01:37:51,616 --> 01:37:52,384
The longtime

1882
01:37:52,640 --> 01:37:53,408
In between

1883
01:37:53,664 --> 01:37:55,456
Edwards before he was pretty regular gas

1884
01:37:58,016 --> 01:37:58,528
Slight

1885
01:37:58,784 --> 01:37:59,552
Wavering on a

1886
01:38:00,064 --> 01:38:01,344
Is part about Trump

1887
01:38:03,904 --> 01:38:05,184
You want to talk about

1888
01:38:06,464 --> 01:38:06,976
Geopolitics

1889
01:38:09,024 --> 01:38:11,072
Whatever you want whatever is that you're thinking of

1890
01:38:11,328 --> 01:38:11,840
He's got a dump

1891
01:38:12,096 --> 01:38:12,608
False

1892
01:38:12,864 --> 01:38:13,632
Everything is about

1893
01:38:20,032 --> 01:38:20,544
Uniform

1894
01:38:21,312 --> 01:38:21,824
False flag

1895
01:38:22,080 --> 01:38:23,104
Got everything

1896
01:38:23,360 --> 01:38:24,384
Alex wants to impress

1897
01:38:24,640 --> 01:38:26,944
Temperature out video

1898
01:38:27,200 --> 01:38:27,968
At the beginning

1899
01:38:28,224 --> 01:38:30,784
Lana Del Rey

1900
01:38:34,624 --> 01:38:36,160
First let's go

1901
01:38:36,416 --> 01:38:39,232
What's your from this little piece that triggers leftist

1902
01:38:39,744 --> 01:38:45,888
Introduction for the video and already it's probably going to be again

1903
01:38:48,192 --> 01:38:53,824
Alex made a second Ms video where he's just doing that Asian

1904
01:38:56,128 --> 01:38:57,152
Because it's let's get

1905
01:38:57,408 --> 01:38:57,920
Triggered

1906
01:39:07,904 --> 01:39:14,048
Video

1907
01:39:20,960 --> 01:39:27,104
He's just a second video like this and it's just a commercial for his band videos

1908
01:39:28,128 --> 01:39:29,408
That's just

1909
01:39:34,528 --> 01:39:36,320
Wow I have no I don't know

1910
01:39:36,576 --> 01:39:38,112
True sympathy towards Alex

1911
01:39:38,880 --> 01:39:40,928
Two and a half years still don't

1912
01:39:41,184 --> 01:39:42,464
Hi I mean but that is

1913
01:39:42,720 --> 01:39:43,232
It's just

1914
01:39:43,488 --> 01:39:44,000
The closer

1915
01:39:44,256 --> 01:39:45,024
This I can get

1916
01:39:45,280 --> 01:39:46,304
Is just like watching

1917
01:39:48,096 --> 01:39:50,912
Look he's a monster but if I was walking by Eminem

1918
01:39:51,168 --> 01:39:51,680
And he was

1919
01:39:51,936 --> 01:39:53,728
A goddamn gutter

1920
01:39:53,984 --> 01:39:56,288
Likes it all over his f******

1921
01:39:57,824 --> 01:39:59,616
A chimney sweep from Mary

1922
01:39:59,872 --> 01:40:00,896
Okay

1923
01:40:01,408 --> 01:40:02,688
I'm like Alex

1924
01:40:02,944 --> 01:40:05,504
I really hope you die sooner rather than later but

1925
01:40:06,016 --> 01:40:06,784
Taxman

1926
01:40:07,040 --> 01:40:11,648
I'm sorry if you're a family member a weird Asian

1927
01:40:11,904 --> 01:40:13,440
Voice

1928
01:40:13,696 --> 01:40:14,464
You do it

1929
01:40:21,120 --> 01:40:22,144
Triggers the liver

1930
01:40:22,400 --> 01:40:25,728
Anybody talk about this other than us

1931
01:40:25,984 --> 01:40:30,848
And we were not triggered as much as we were mocking how sad desperate attempt

1932
01:40:32,640 --> 01:40:33,664
This is

1933
01:40:33,920 --> 01:40:34,944
Trigger people

1934
01:40:35,200 --> 01:40:36,992
In order to get them to repost it

1935
01:40:37,248 --> 01:40:39,552
Talk about how bad you are in order to get free

1936
01:40:39,808 --> 01:40:42,880
Like we're not triggered by this

1937
01:40:43,136 --> 01:40:48,512
It's a little too it's too transparent.

1938
01:40:48,768 --> 01:40:51,840
Just promoting your stupid video website

1939
01:40:52,096 --> 01:40:56,960
You couldn't be more clear what you're trying to do

1940
01:40:57,216 --> 01:40:57,728
Any soap

1941
01:40:57,984 --> 01:40:58,496
Proud of himself

1942
01:41:00,288 --> 01:41:01,056
The the

1943
01:41:01,824 --> 01:41:02,336
The cherry on top

1944
01:41:03,360 --> 01:41:04,640
Look at what I did

1945
01:41:04,896 --> 01:41:05,920
Gazzali's left

1946
01:41:06,432 --> 01:41:06,944
Sydney weather

1947
01:41:07,712 --> 01:41:08,736
Tylko home

1948
01:41:10,016 --> 01:41:10,784
Bad job

1949
01:41:11,296 --> 01:41:13,600
Thousands response

1950
01:41:13,856 --> 01:41:14,368
The video

1951
01:41:20,768 --> 01:41:21,792
He's an ID login

1952
01:41:22,048 --> 01:41:23,584
He's not going over to Alex's side

1953
01:41:23,840 --> 01:41:24,864
Skeleton is still polite

1954
01:41:26,144 --> 01:41:28,448
Do cows always so serious

1955
01:41:28,704 --> 01:41:31,008
He was not

1956
01:41:34,336 --> 01:41:34,848
Brilliant

1957
01:41:35,104 --> 01:41:40,480
Come up with

1958
01:41:49,184 --> 01:41:49,952
Info

1959
01:41:56,096 --> 01:42:02,240
We will be The Gatekeepers abilities

1960
01:42:02,496 --> 01:42:04,800
Sure seems like

1961
01:42:05,056 --> 01:42:11,200
Kick people off if you want the lost by not allowing long

1962
01:42:19,136 --> 01:42:25,280
What is Mike Brian stelter

1963
01:42:35,264 --> 01:42:36,544
I'm still on YouTube

1964
01:42:37,824 --> 01:42:41,152
Such ridiculous bulshit presentation

1965
01:42:42,432 --> 01:42:44,992
This is all about promoting Infowars

1966
01:42:45,504 --> 01:42:47,296
His own content

1967
01:42:47,552 --> 01:42:49,344
Contact I guess

1968
01:42:50,624 --> 01:42:51,392
I highly doubt

1969
01:42:51,648 --> 01:42:52,672
But like

1970
01:42:52,928 --> 01:42:55,488
It's about that it's about funneling

1971
01:42:55,744 --> 01:42:56,768
People to Infowars

1972
01:42:57,024 --> 01:42:58,816
And anybody who's not

1973
01:42:59,072 --> 01:43:01,120
There's no reason for him to give them

1974
01:43:01,376 --> 01:43:03,424
Unless there's someone here

1975
01:43:03,936 --> 01:43:05,472
Like Sargon of akkad

1976
01:43:05,728 --> 01:43:06,752
If you has a big fan base

1977
01:43:07,008 --> 01:43:08,544
If he wanted to channel on there

1978
01:43:08,800 --> 01:43:10,592
Allison probably allows

1979
01:43:10,848 --> 01:43:11,616
Him more traffic

1980
01:43:12,640 --> 01:43:14,688
But they're still

1981
01:43:16,736 --> 01:43:17,248
Stupid

1982
01:43:18,016 --> 01:43:19,040
Even for what

1983
01:43:19,808 --> 01:43:20,832
Aspires to be

1984
01:43:21,088 --> 01:43:22,368
I don't see the path that works

1985
01:43:22,624 --> 01:43:23,392
And it's not worth it

1986
01:43:23,648 --> 01:43:24,160
It expires today

1987
01:43:24,416 --> 01:43:25,440
No it is

1988
01:43:25,696 --> 01:43:26,464
It is

1989
01:43:26,976 --> 01:43:28,256
It has all the Hallmarks

1990
01:43:28,768 --> 01:43:30,048
A half-ass

1991
01:43:31,072 --> 01:43:32,864
It has every Hallmark of

1992
01:43:33,120 --> 01:43:33,632
People like

1993
01:43:34,400 --> 01:43:35,168
What we got to do

1994
01:43:36,192 --> 01:43:37,472
We just got to do something

1995
01:43:37,728 --> 01:43:43,360
Because everything that we've been doing isn't working so let's let's try this

1996
01:43:44,640 --> 01:43:45,408
You don't have any

1997
01:43:45,664 --> 01:43:46,688
Providers other than

1998
01:43:47,200 --> 01:43:47,712
People who work for

1999
01:43:49,760 --> 01:43:52,064
It's responding to something that people want

2000
01:43:52,320 --> 01:43:53,344
Like you hear all these

2001
01:43:54,112 --> 01:43:54,880
Really messed up

2002
01:43:55,136 --> 01:43:56,928
Places with internet

2003
01:43:57,184 --> 01:43:58,464
We need an alternative

2004
01:43:58,720 --> 01:43:59,232
To you too

2005
01:43:59,488 --> 01:44:00,256
Right

2006
01:44:00,512 --> 01:44:01,536
Thinks or Acts

2007
01:44:01,792 --> 01:44:03,584
It's like he's feeling that need

2008
01:44:03,840 --> 01:44:05,120
But what he's actually doing is

2009
01:44:06,144 --> 01:44:06,912
Gatekeeping

2010
01:44:07,168 --> 01:44:09,216
Creating his own space

2011
01:44:09,984 --> 01:44:12,032
No one

2012
01:44:12,288 --> 01:44:13,568
Who are in those

2013
01:44:14,592 --> 01:44:15,616
Say crypto-fascist

2014
01:44:16,128 --> 01:44:17,664
Neo-Nazi or Jason

2015
01:44:17,920 --> 01:44:18,944
White nationalist

2016
01:44:19,456 --> 01:44:24,064
Pipe world

2017
01:44:24,576 --> 01:44:25,600
They're not going to

2018
01:44:25,856 --> 01:44:26,624
To come on Alex

2019
01:44:27,136 --> 01:44:27,648
Right

2020
01:44:30,720 --> 01:44:31,488
The thing itself

2021
01:44:31,744 --> 01:44:32,512
Success

2022
01:44:32,768 --> 01:44:34,816
Have to have before you even launched

2023
01:44:35,072 --> 01:44:39,936
Had to have a bunch of people already Chris totally

2024
01:44:40,192 --> 01:44:46,336
What's the people who worked for Spotify

2025
01:44:46,592 --> 01:44:48,384
Few more cable

2026
01:44:48,640 --> 01:44:50,176
You have to have a catalog

2027
01:44:50,432 --> 01:44:51,200
When you launched

2028
01:44:51,712 --> 01:44:52,224
Otherwise it

2029
01:44:52,480 --> 01:44:53,504
It's going to disappear nobody

2030
01:44:54,528 --> 01:44:55,296
So either this

2031
01:44:56,064 --> 01:44:57,344
Completely

2032
01:45:00,416 --> 01:45:02,464
260

2033
01:45:02,720 --> 01:45:04,512
Clips

2034
01:45:10,144 --> 01:45:11,680
Care too much about that

2035
01:45:11,936 --> 01:45:15,264
But three things that I think are particularly absurd

2036
01:45:15,776 --> 01:45:17,056
ER

2037
01:45:17,312 --> 01:45:18,848
Countdown

2038
01:45:19,360 --> 01:45:22,432
In no particular order just in chronological in the interview order

2039
01:45:22,944 --> 01:45:23,712
Here's the first one

2040
01:45:27,296 --> 01:45:33,440
Well they don't have any basis of knowledge

2041
01:45:33,696 --> 01:45:36,512
Pro Services because they don't understand the concept

2042
01:45:37,280 --> 01:45:43,424
Socialism always have hidden victim regulations always have hidden victim

2043
01:45:46,496 --> 01:45:47,264
Capitalism

2044
01:45:47,520 --> 01:45:53,664
Notoriously

2045
01:45:53,920 --> 01:45:54,432
System is

2046
01:45:54,688 --> 01:45:56,992
Entirely right or without problems

2047
01:45:57,248 --> 01:46:01,344
If that is one of your Marquis criticisms of people who

2048
01:46:02,368 --> 01:46:03,392
Push for socialist

2049
01:46:03,648 --> 01:46:04,928
Cleaning policies

2050
01:46:05,184 --> 01:46:06,208
You are an idiot

2051
01:46:06,464 --> 01:46:09,024
You're pretending that

2052
01:46:09,280 --> 01:46:13,376
Hidden victims are your problems and you should also have robots

2053
01:46:13,632 --> 01:46:17,728
Critique of capitalism problem

2054
01:46:18,240 --> 01:46:19,776
It's not unique to this

2055
01:46:20,032 --> 01:46:24,128
His problem is he

2056
01:46:24,384 --> 01:46:25,152
In socialism

2057
01:46:25,408 --> 01:46:27,712
Hidden victims

2058
01:46:27,968 --> 01:46:29,248
Where is right now

2059
01:46:31,040 --> 01:46:35,136
That might be more accurate way to read his comment

2060
01:46:36,416 --> 01:46:40,768
Even if you don't want to apply that like assumed motivation

2061
01:46:41,024 --> 01:46:42,048
He's still making any

2062
01:46:42,304 --> 01:46:42,816
Credibly Slim

2063
01:46:43,072 --> 01:46:44,864
Lindsay argument

2064
01:46:45,632 --> 01:46:46,144
A nonagon

2065
01:46:46,912 --> 01:46:49,216
Stupor

2066
01:46:49,472 --> 01:46:52,288
You know your response everybody not an argument

2067
01:46:55,360 --> 01:46:55,872
God I hate

2068
01:46:56,640 --> 01:46:57,152
She's the worst

2069
01:46:59,456 --> 01:47:01,760
Making a prediction coming in at the number two

2070
01:47:02,784 --> 01:47:03,808
But the big

2071
01:47:04,064 --> 01:47:10,208
Problem comes in World War 3 when we're going to absorb a nuclear First Strike our military's going to be decapitated in Raleigh-Durham

2072
01:47:10,464 --> 01:47:12,000
You're going to come out

2073
01:47:12,512 --> 01:47:18,656
We didn't know this was happening but the only way we can defend ourselves now is to join in a militarized global government with tax

2074
01:47:28,640 --> 01:47:32,992
So we're going to absorb the first nuclear First Strike of the globalist

2075
01:47:33,248 --> 01:47:34,784
To be in Bunker's or readout

2076
01:47:35,296 --> 01:47:37,600
Emergent create a one-world government

2077
01:47:38,880 --> 01:47:45,024
False flag

2078
01:47:47,328 --> 01:47:47,840
Nothing has

2079
01:47:49,888 --> 01:47:50,656
You know what I find

2080
01:47:51,424 --> 01:47:52,448
That nothing is ever happen

2081
01:47:52,704 --> 01:47:53,216
Is that

2082
01:47:54,240 --> 01:47:57,824
Nobody is talking about how the only way the human race survives

2083
01:47:58,336 --> 01:47:58,848
Is if we

2084
01:47:59,104 --> 01:47:59,616
Absorb

2085
01:48:00,896 --> 01:48:02,944
Do you know what I mean like

2086
01:48:03,200 --> 01:48:08,320
Except a first-strike kind of created equal a reaction of

2087
01:48:08,576 --> 01:48:09,856
Nuclear

2088
01:48:10,112 --> 01:48:16,256
Super clear you're not saying the only way

2089
01:48:24,448 --> 01:48:25,984
I don't know if I can hunt

2090
01:48:26,240 --> 01:48:27,264
But I'm inclined

2091
01:48:27,776 --> 01:48:29,056
Agree with that

2092
01:48:30,080 --> 01:48:31,360
Because that's one place

2093
01:48:31,616 --> 01:48:32,128
Being nuked

2094
01:48:32,384 --> 01:48:32,896
Diversity

2095
01:48:33,152 --> 01:48:36,224
Everybody what's the Chain Reaction starts it's all

2096
01:48:36,480 --> 01:48:38,272
The only way would be if somebody is

2097
01:48:38,528 --> 01:48:39,040
Like guys

2098
01:48:39,296 --> 01:48:40,320
We're not going

2099
01:48:40,576 --> 01:48:41,344
To respond

2100
01:48:41,600 --> 01:48:46,976
The State of Affairs is everyone dismantling their nuclear weapons

2101
01:48:47,232 --> 01:48:51,328
But

2102
01:48:51,584 --> 01:48:52,864
That were not responding with

2103
01:48:54,144 --> 01:48:56,448
Equal measure is a preferable outcome

2104
01:48:56,704 --> 01:49:00,032
CIAA events Nuclear Strike would be devastated

2105
01:49:00,288 --> 01:49:01,568
Being one of the worst thing that could ever happen

2106
01:49:01,824 --> 01:49:03,104
Right

2107
01:49:03,616 --> 01:49:05,408
Of all of the

2108
01:49:05,664 --> 01:49:07,200
Do we need to have

2109
01:49:07,456 --> 01:49:09,760
To keep our ability to strike first on the table is like

2110
01:49:10,528 --> 01:49:11,296
You're insane

2111
01:49:11,552 --> 01:49:12,832
You're absolutely

2112
01:49:13,344 --> 01:49:15,648
You would ever use them.

2113
01:49:16,672 --> 01:49:17,440
And anybody who doesn't say

2114
01:49:17,952 --> 01:49:18,464
That is

2115
01:49:18,720 --> 01:49:19,488
Insane is insane

2116
01:49:21,280 --> 01:49:26,144
Yes I had a hard time tracking

2117
01:49:32,544 --> 01:49:33,312
F****** stupid

2118
01:49:34,336 --> 01:49:40,480
Then you simply have to say I'm sorry we're not dealing with this anymore

2119
01:49:40,736 --> 01:49:46,624
Public Schools you don't try to improve an inherently evil institution it just keeps people in there longer

2120
01:49:47,136 --> 01:49:52,000
How to Public Schools even through private her homeschooling education

2121
01:49:52,256 --> 01:49:56,608
Everybody skousen

2122
01:49:57,376 --> 01:50:00,960
There are some hidden victims

2123
01:50:01,216 --> 01:50:05,312
Maybe a couple baby a couple

2124
01:50:06,336 --> 01:50:07,872
I don't I feel like

2125
01:50:08,128 --> 01:50:08,640
Is

2126
01:50:09,920 --> 01:50:13,504
It's the same thing with a lot of these initiatives that Alex really wants

2127
01:50:13,760 --> 01:50:15,040
Gaston

2128
01:50:15,296 --> 01:50:16,576
In This World Views they put forth

2129
01:50:18,112 --> 01:50:18,880
4C

2130
01:50:19,136 --> 01:50:21,696
An ideal situation off in the future

2131
01:50:22,208 --> 01:50:25,024
Which is like everybody's homeschooled and we're all great

2132
01:50:25,536 --> 01:50:28,352
Realize is that the process

2133
01:50:29,632 --> 01:50:30,912
That outcome

2134
01:50:31,168 --> 01:50:35,520
Would be devastated it would destroy countless lies

2135
01:50:35,776 --> 01:50:38,592
Pluto from ever reaching the destination

2136
01:50:38,848 --> 01:50:40,128
There their method

2137
01:50:40,384 --> 01:50:42,432
To get to where they want to go

2138
01:50:42,688 --> 01:50:45,248
Makes it so that end goal is

2139
01:50:46,016 --> 01:50:46,528
See where you coming

2140
01:50:49,344 --> 01:50:49,856
Bvn

2141
01:50:52,416 --> 01:50:54,720
I just think it's delusional to think

2142
01:50:54,976 --> 01:50:57,280
You're ever going to get to a point where everyone

2143
01:50:57,792 --> 01:50:58,304
Able

2144
01:50:58,816 --> 01:51:03,168
To take your kids out of school and homeschool

2145
01:51:03,424 --> 01:51:04,960
Like from a financial

2146
01:51:05,216 --> 01:51:06,240
From a life Logistics

2147
01:51:06,752 --> 01:51:08,032
There just isn't

2148
01:51:08,544 --> 01:51:09,056
The ability

2149
01:51:09,312 --> 01:51:10,336
For everybody to do that

2150
01:51:15,200 --> 01:51:15,712
In the sky

2151
01:51:17,248 --> 01:51:19,040
What you're advocating for is

2152
01:51:19,552 --> 01:51:20,320
Never

2153
01:51:21,088 --> 01:51:22,624
Prove the public schools

2154
01:51:24,672 --> 01:51:25,952
I find this repulsive

2155
01:51:26,208 --> 01:51:28,512
I find this to be a terrible

2156
01:51:28,768 --> 01:51:29,536
Prescription for life

2157
01:51:33,376 --> 01:51:34,400
Are people who

2158
01:51:34,656 --> 01:51:36,192
You know wouldn't be able to

2159
01:51:36,448 --> 01:51:38,752
Use the remedy to begin with right

2160
01:51:39,008 --> 01:51:42,080
Would be able to homeschool

2161
01:51:42,336 --> 01:51:46,176
Work multiple jobs

2162
01:51:46,944 --> 01:51:48,480
It's just prohibited for them

2163
01:51:50,272 --> 01:51:53,344
By what you're suggesting of let's make the schools worse

2164
01:51:53,600 --> 01:51:54,880
Yeah well this is

2165
01:51:55,648 --> 01:51:56,416
The first clip is

2166
01:51:56,672 --> 01:51:57,184
Is very clear

2167
01:52:01,024 --> 01:52:01,792
Where is right now

2168
01:52:02,048 --> 01:52:03,072
I am not a victim

2169
01:52:03,328 --> 01:52:03,840
And I don't really

2170
01:52:04,096 --> 01:52:04,608
Care about the

2171
01:52:04,864 --> 01:52:05,376
People who are

2172
01:52:09,728 --> 01:52:11,520
When you talk about the elitist

2173
01:52:12,032 --> 01:52:13,312
This is out of touch

2174
01:52:13,568 --> 01:52:14,336
Completely

2175
01:52:14,592 --> 01:52:15,104
Ballpark

2176
01:52:15,360 --> 01:52:15,872
He just doesn't

2177
01:52:16,128 --> 01:52:16,896
Even comprehend

2178
01:52:17,152 --> 01:52:17,664
The live

2179
01:52:17,920 --> 01:52:18,688
The people who aren't

2180
01:52:19,200 --> 01:52:20,992
He also goes on to say

2181
01:52:25,344 --> 01:52:26,624
That doesn't mean

2182
01:52:26,880 --> 01:52:28,672
Think that you should have

2183
01:52:29,184 --> 01:52:33,536
Everybody everybody

2184
01:52:34,048 --> 01:52:35,072
Has a choice I guess I don't know

2185
01:52:35,584 --> 01:52:36,608
I mean specifically

2186
01:52:36,864 --> 01:52:39,936
With the scouts I don't want

2187
01:52:40,192 --> 01:52:41,728
Teaching anyone at the arch

2188
01:52:41,984 --> 01:52:48,128
Family of anti-communism I do trust

2189
01:52:48,384 --> 01:52:49,152
Curriculum

2190
01:52:49,664 --> 01:52:50,432
Yeah

2191
01:52:50,688 --> 01:52:51,968
Hi I just

2192
01:52:52,224 --> 01:52:52,736
I think it's

2193
01:52:52,992 --> 01:52:53,504
Absurd

2194
01:52:55,296 --> 01:52:57,088
Mentality you are just like

2195
01:52:58,112 --> 01:52:59,648
Applying whatever is true

2196
01:52:59,904 --> 01:53:01,440
Subjective

2197
01:53:01,696 --> 01:53:02,976
To you on everyone

2198
01:53:03,232 --> 01:53:03,744
Objectively

2199
01:53:04,256 --> 01:53:06,304
It's deeply unfair to

2200
01:53:06,560 --> 01:53:07,072
People's life

2201
01:53:08,352 --> 01:53:10,400
What you're advocating for is hurting

2202
01:53:11,680 --> 01:53:12,448
That's all

2203
01:53:12,704 --> 01:53:13,216
It's that same

2204
01:53:13,984 --> 01:53:14,752
Kind of concept

2205
01:53:15,008 --> 01:53:15,520
So many of these

2206
01:53:17,056 --> 01:53:18,080
Well you know what

2207
01:53:18,336 --> 01:53:20,384
Is that the government is running

2208
01:53:21,152 --> 01:53:22,176
My family's running

2209
01:53:25,760 --> 01:53:26,272
I guess

2210
01:53:26,528 --> 01:53:27,552
Why you think that

2211
01:53:28,320 --> 01:53:29,088
But you're an idiot

2212
01:53:29,600 --> 01:53:31,136
So go back to f****** public

2213
01:53:31,392 --> 01:53:33,440
Old school and don't listen to your dad

2214
01:53:47,008 --> 01:53:47,776
Yeah

2215
01:53:48,032 --> 01:53:48,544
Never been

2216
01:53:49,056 --> 01:53:50,336
Situation where people are like

2217
01:53:51,360 --> 01:53:52,384
Schools are so good

2218
01:53:52,640 --> 01:53:55,712
And everything is just whatever's on sale

2219
01:53:56,224 --> 01:53:56,736
These guys

2220
01:53:57,248 --> 01:53:58,784
The really cheering for

2221
01:53:59,296 --> 01:54:02,112
Negative outcome for everyone is unlike themselves and that's

2222
01:54:02,880 --> 01:54:03,904
Very consistent threat

2223
01:54:04,928 --> 01:54:08,512
It was interesting to me I mean like first of all the Lana Del Rey

2224
01:54:08,768 --> 01:54:09,280
Is just like

2225
01:54:09,536 --> 01:54:10,304
Cannot be more excited

2226
01:54:10,560 --> 01:54:11,072
About this

2227
01:54:11,328 --> 01:54:14,144
Weird progression that makes me

2228
01:54:14,656 --> 01:54:20,800
I do feel a little weird but where do we go next

2229
01:54:21,312 --> 01:54:24,128
So what are you got I don't think you ever get on board of Carly Rae

2230
01:54:26,432 --> 01:54:27,712
I'm out

2231
01:54:29,248 --> 01:54:29,760
Never going to be

2232
01:54:30,016 --> 01:54:34,880
Rainbow

2233
01:54:35,136 --> 01:54:37,184
Rainbow Dash

2234
01:54:37,440 --> 01:54:41,024
Yes I think you would have a lot of trouble with like woman

2235
01:54:41,280 --> 01:54:42,560
Yeah and

2236
01:54:45,120 --> 01:54:51,264
Learn to let go I don't think you'd like I really do

2237
01:54:51,520 --> 01:54:54,336
But they would like that

2238
01:54:54,592 --> 01:54:57,408
Really evolve dozen artists from her days of like

2239
01:55:09,184 --> 01:55:10,208
Warrior album

2240
01:55:10,720 --> 01:55:15,072
She's definitely come a long way but the progression is something absolutely not be on board

2241
01:55:18,144 --> 01:55:18,656
He's a

2242
01:55:19,424 --> 01:55:19,936
You going to go backward

2243
01:55:22,240 --> 01:55:24,032
Michelle Branch

2244
01:55:24,288 --> 01:55:24,800
What else

2245
01:55:26,592 --> 01:55:27,616
Neko Case

2246
01:55:27,872 --> 01:55:33,504
Maybe

2247
01:55:36,576 --> 01:55:40,928
I don't I don't know it's very absurd I love it though

2248
01:55:41,184 --> 01:55:42,208
Texting is this sort of like

2249
01:55:42,720 --> 01:55:44,000
3 act structure

2250
01:55:44,512 --> 01:55:45,024
Show kind of hat

2251
01:55:45,792 --> 01:55:48,096
Things that are

2252
01:55:48,352 --> 01:55:49,376
Kind of on message

2253
01:55:49,632 --> 01:55:50,144
For Alex

2254
01:55:50,656 --> 01:55:51,680
And that's very strange

2255
01:55:52,192 --> 01:55:54,496
You know you have the kids

2256
01:55:54,752 --> 01:55:55,264
Then schools

2257
01:55:55,776 --> 01:55:57,568
And the beginning and then the interview with

2258
01:55:57,824 --> 01:55:58,848
The Parkland father

2259
01:55:59,104 --> 01:56:00,384
That makes up the first hour

2260
01:56:00,640 --> 01:56:02,688
2nd hour is all the climate

2261
01:56:02,944 --> 01:56:06,528
Third hour is interview with Joel skousen

2262
01:56:06,784 --> 01:56:09,344
Much more of a rigid structure that other

2263
01:56:09,856 --> 01:56:10,368
Episode

2264
01:56:10,624 --> 01:56:11,904
Leaving to the present day that I've lived

2265
01:56:12,672 --> 01:56:14,208
And I don't I don't know that makes

2266
01:56:14,720 --> 01:56:15,232
Easier to

2267
01:56:15,744 --> 01:56:16,256
But it wasn't

2268
01:56:16,512 --> 01:56:18,304
As much of a chore listening to it

2269
01:56:18,816 --> 01:56:22,400
Alex is like scattershot and literally just bouncing off the walls

2270
01:56:22,656 --> 01:56:27,008
This very difficult

2271
01:56:27,520 --> 01:56:28,032
Keep up with him

2272
01:56:28,288 --> 01:56:30,080
Keep track of like what are you even saying

2273
01:56:30,592 --> 01:56:31,360
Maybe this is

2274
01:56:32,128 --> 01:56:33,152
Blessing

2275
01:56:33,408 --> 01:56:34,176
For me and Subway

2276
01:56:34,432 --> 01:56:35,712
Terms of actually

2277
01:56:36,992 --> 01:56:39,296
Dealing with you.

2278
01:56:39,808 --> 01:56:41,344
In keeping with Alex

2279
01:56:43,904 --> 01:56:44,416
Truth

2280
01:56:45,184 --> 01:56:45,952
It is one of those things

2281
01:56:48,768 --> 01:56:49,536
Either that

2282
01:56:50,304 --> 01:56:50,816
Giving a

2283
01:56:51,584 --> 01:56:53,120
And trying to make a better show

2284
01:56:55,168 --> 01:56:55,936
Studies completely

2285
01:56:56,192 --> 01:56:56,704
We're giving up

2286
01:56:56,960 --> 01:57:00,288
And me letting somebody else tell him what he's giving his producers more

2287
01:57:02,592 --> 01:57:06,688
There's no lighters

2288
01:57:06,944 --> 01:57:09,504
Anymore it's possible that like his sobriety is

2289
01:57:10,016 --> 01:57:14,368
Kicking in his clearing up a little bit from those days when he was

2290
01:57:14,880 --> 01:57:16,928
Scream about the ways to learn

2291
01:57:17,952 --> 01:57:24,096
Sometimes helps you with your mental organization

2292
01:57:24,352 --> 01:57:26,144
Stirrup for a while

2293
01:57:26,912 --> 01:57:30,240
It could be I never believed him

2294
01:57:30,752 --> 01:57:33,312
When he says anything's yeah but he has

2295
01:57:33,568 --> 01:57:34,336
You know

2296
01:57:34,592 --> 01:57:36,896
Not drinking and trying to exercise more

2297
01:57:37,152 --> 01:57:41,760
And there's a decent it just puts him in a place where he's better able to organize

2298
01:57:42,016 --> 01:57:43,552
What is presented

2299
01:57:44,064 --> 01:57:44,832
If you look back

2300
01:57:45,088 --> 01:57:46,880
He's all over the place but

2301
01:57:47,136 --> 01:57:48,160
You could make

2302
01:57:48,672 --> 01:57:51,744
2019 2018

2303
01:57:52,256 --> 01:57:53,280
So much just like

2304
01:57:53,792 --> 01:57:54,560
This guy

2305
01:57:54,816 --> 01:57:55,328
Is on WOW

2306
01:57:56,608 --> 01:57:58,144
Process of thinking

2307
01:57:58,400 --> 01:57:59,680
Is disorienting

2308
01:57:59,936 --> 01:58:01,216
There's still a bit of that

2309
01:58:01,472 --> 01:58:02,752
Maybe maybe it's a sign

2310
01:58:03,520 --> 01:58:07,616
And it is just as producers

2311
01:58:07,872 --> 01:58:09,920
I'll be more on the ball or

2312
01:58:10,688 --> 01:58:11,200
It could be is

2313
01:58:12,224 --> 01:58:12,736
Last-gasp

2314
01:58:13,248 --> 01:58:14,016
Attempt at like

2315
01:58:14,272 --> 01:58:15,552
Maybe this will write this year

2316
01:58:16,576 --> 01:58:17,088
Control mice

2317
01:58:17,856 --> 01:58:21,952
Who knows

2318
01:58:23,488 --> 01:58:25,280
Alex

2319
01:58:25,536 --> 01:58:27,072
Rainwater

2320
01:58:28,096 --> 01:58:29,888
Ice Cube NWA Ice Cube

2321
01:58:30,656 --> 01:58:31,168
Juicy ice

2322
01:58:32,448 --> 01:58:33,216
Alex

2323
01:58:34,240 --> 01:58:39,360
On Friday with either another present because Alex

2324
01:58:40,896 --> 01:58:41,920
We don't know his response at

2325
01:58:42,176 --> 01:58:43,200
Set timer recording

2326
01:58:46,272 --> 01:58:46,784
Where you said that

2327
01:58:47,040 --> 01:58:48,320
The future is not for globalist

2328
01:58:48,576 --> 01:58:49,344
It's for Patriot

2329
01:58:49,600 --> 01:58:53,184
And we have to assume Alex's freaking out about that

2330
01:58:53,440 --> 01:58:55,744
Skip this episode on time we don't have time to see this

2331
01:58:56,000 --> 01:58:58,048
We may have to do that on Friday

2332
01:58:58,304 --> 01:58:59,584
Or we might have to do the

2333
01:58:59,840 --> 01:59:03,680
PTI podcast

2334
01:59:03,936 --> 01:59:07,264
Website

2335
01:59:07,520 --> 01:59:08,288

You could recommended

2342
01:59:25,184 --> 01:59:25,696
But let me tell you

2343
01:59:26,208 --> 01:59:26,720
About the bay

2344
01:59:27,232 --> 01:59:27,744
Way to get

2345
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:29,792
The shop

2346
01:59:30,816 --> 01:59:31,328
Country

2347
01:59:31,584 --> 01:59:35,936
Exactly you got to go down to Sonoma you go through there

2348
01:59:37,472 --> 01:59:38,240
Is Rosa padros

2349
01:59:38,496 --> 01:59:39,776
Does grapes if you've ever seen it in

2350
01:59:40,032 --> 01:59:41,056
In the fall time of year

2351
01:59:41,312 --> 01:59:42,336
I've been amazed

2352
01:59:42,848 --> 01:59:45,152
You're going to walk down the 38

2353
01:59:45,408 --> 01:59:47,456
Throw of the Sonoma

2354
01:59:48,736 --> 01:59:54,880
I thought for sure one of them

2355
02:00:03,840 --> 02:00:09,984
My brain just shut off all the wineries

2356
02:00:10,240 --> 02:00:12,800
3828

2357
02:00:13,056 --> 02:00:16,128
Grab the third grade pull it out there

2358
02:00:16,896 --> 02:00:17,408

02:00:18,432 --> 02:00:19,968
