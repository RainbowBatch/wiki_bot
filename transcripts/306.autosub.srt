00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,192
That we have just dropped

15
00:01:12,448 --> 00:01:14,752

As the water looked

I'm not super afraid of heights

33
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:11,840
But I'm not into

34
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:17,216
That's not the highest parasailing

35
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:18,752
Oh really

36
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:26,432
Coronavirus

37
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,272
Probably building is hiring

38
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:31,552
I think so

39
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:34,112
A buddy of mine had a wedding

40
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:36,160
At the top of the Aon building

41
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:36,928
That's fun

42
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:40,000

43
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:44,096

For real for that wedding

47
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,128
So weird

48
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:59,712
Down to the bottom to smoke

49
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:05,088
For most people

50
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:06,368
I think there were enough of us that

51
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:11,744
Cisco smoke in the corner over there now

52
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:17,376

Two episodes

62
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:49,632
I've heard in a very long time

63
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:51,936
Tired of myself making Proclamation

64
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:55,520
Like I would never

65
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:59,360
Oh it's real up there Alex is very weird

66
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:05,760
Yeah you do occasionally have a bit of a Carson like every night you have the greatest

67
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:12,160
Put myself in a certain pattern but like I like

68
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:14,720
Stuff made me gas

00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:21,119

00:04:24,447 --> 00:04:29,055
The kind generosity and support of our listeners and

71
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:32,639

Why you pimp so good

81
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:26,911
Freakishly large

82
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:39,711
So maybe just like municipal building

83
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:45,599
Calculate clovelly X

84
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:53,023

85
00:05:56,863 --> 00:06:01,471
Super buck.

86
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:03,519
We start off on the 4th

87
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:04,543
Alex

88
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:07,615
Begin the show talking about it's not really all that sucked up

89
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:11,711
We can tell that he's head is not right

90
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:17,599
It's getting real pervy kind of about a topic that is not f*****-up at all and is not pretty

91
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:18,879
You'll see what I mean

92
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:19,647
Veritas

93
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:23,487
We have been trying movers here on are the audience clapping

94
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:24,767
Parkers Lighthouse

95
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:29,375
And myself at law firms that I paid

96
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:33,215
To follow my own research ideas

97
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:38,079
That reflected the reality

98
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:41,919
I didn't just make it up the last 3 years

99
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:50,623
Control

100
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:54,975
I watch today

101
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:02,911
It's

102
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:07,007
USA Today

103
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:16,223
Presidential office

104
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:29,023
Turn the music up

105
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:34,911
I love that song.

106
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:36,703
Whatever

107
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:38,495
Can't not have the feeling

108
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:45,663
He's talking about is the houses

109
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:46,687
Opened up the

110
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:48,991
Possible

111
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:50,271
Investigations in

112
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:53,599
Facebook Amazon Google

113
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:59,999
Pretty much

114
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:02,047
People across the political aisle

115
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:03,583
Probably like

116
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:07,167
Anti-competitive practice

117
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:07,935
Says they're being

118
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:14,591
Turn out the competition

119
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:21,759
I hate to assume before an investigation

120
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:24,575
I don't think breaking up

121
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:26,111
Dances that are found to be acting

122
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:27,135
Monopolist

123
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:37,375
Yeah but what Alex is doing is he's complaining house investigation with

124
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:38,655
Campaign rhetoric

125
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:39,679
The trumps been putting a

126
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:43,775
Because I realize that he doesn't really have a

127
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:49,919
Into the 2020 election without the support of the agitators on

128
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:53,759
People who are like the Alex Jones's of the 2016 election

129
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:55,551
In order to maintain

130
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:56,319
Support

131
00:08:56,575 --> 00:08:58,111
Thinks he needs to do is give lip-service

132
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:02,463
So a bunch of them feel like they're being unfairly censured for their kin

133
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:03,487
Conservative positions

134
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:05,535
On the social media platform

135
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:07,327
Does

136
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:11,935
His you know he gives that conservatives are being unfairly targeted

137
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:16,031
You can sleep this campaign rhetoric that Trump is putting out

138
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:17,823
With this house investigation

139
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:19,615
And you turn it into

140
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:20,383
These

141
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:22,687
Companies are being investigated for

142
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:24,991
The unfair treatment of

143
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:31,391
When in reality old Trump is doing is trying to create this season's version

144
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:34,463
End of lock her up

145
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:35,231
Jessie

146
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:36,767
Victory Alex

147
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:39,839
Anyway

148
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:42,143
It's weird cuz that issue is not something

149
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:47,775
They would make a normal people growl

150
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:51,359
You can tell like if he's covering this story that way

151
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:54,175
Lookout

152
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:57,247
We talked a little bit more about the Social Media stuff

153
00:09:57,503 --> 00:09:59,039
Before he gets

154
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:01,087
Real real

155
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:02,367
F****** out there

156
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:06,719
He's talking about the social media

157
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:07,743
Stop

158
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:08,511
Contacts

159
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:09,279
In which

160
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:10,303
Scuffing it

161
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:11,839
Should lead you to believe that

162
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:13,375
Not right

163
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:20,287
Design for the global Chinese social score to control human behavior

164
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:29,759
Anyway you slice it

165
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:36,671
Where you'll get the US

166
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:39,743
Areas

167
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:42,815
Is the China

168
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:45,887
Helping build the architecture of this and that apple

169
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:52,287
Google

170
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:55,615
One year ago

171
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:09,951
No they didn't say that

172
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:16,607
The Chinese customers

173
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:22,751
Which is that we should

174
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:29,663
Soto

175
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:31,199
It was the entire world

176
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:38,623
More important

177
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:40,415
Beginning

178
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:47,071
In some way this social media is what was prophesied

179
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:52,191
I don't think he's wrong

180
00:11:54,751 --> 00:12:00,895
I don't think you would talk that way at all if you still want it

181
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:04,223
What's the difference for you and I

182
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:07,551
Maybe this is the coming of the Beast

183
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:10,111
I still have a Facebook

184
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:13,695
I've got kicked off YouTube still recognized

185
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:16,511
Westerly wood

186
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:19,839
If you didn't have a business interest

187
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:23,935
So in this next clip

188
00:12:24,191 --> 00:12:27,007
What we've got is Alex apologizing

189
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:28,543
He's not covering

190
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:29,311
Too much news

191
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:38,015
It is not forgiven

192
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:44,159
The world route

193
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:46,463
I would argue it's too difficult for him to

194
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:49,023
Emotionally difficult

195
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:51,327
Action News here

196
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:54,655
I wondered why I don't cover a lot of this everyone.

197
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:57,471
Get ready for hours at home and I get ready for

198
00:12:57,983 --> 00:13:00,799
Hours

199
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:04,639
The reason he said for an hour here and

200
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:08,479
He's trying to say like 4 hours before

201
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:13,343
Is because recently there was a new story about how some of these depositions

202
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:18,463
Of other Infowars employees

203
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:20,767
There's an article about that for the

204
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:28,191
Alex gets the story before he goes on air

205
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:29,215
Claimed that here

206
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:33,055
Here I do it for an hour

207
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:35,359
Workout gear

208
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:42,271
You should be honest that he doesn't do that much work because it's so much worse than Magic

209
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:48,671
And this is the product more tolerable

210
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:51,999
No

211
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:53,279
Off and on

212
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:58,655
The left is so evil

213
00:13:58,911 --> 00:14:01,983
And socrate just show into doing that

214
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:18,367
I want you to run away from that comes looking for you

215
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:22,719
Runaway inflation

216
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:26,303
They're going after the children

217
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:28,607
Here's an example

218
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:29,887
So

219
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:32,959
He's got I can't I can't cover these

220
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:35,007
News because

221
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:36,031
S*** is to

222
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:36,799
Difficulty

223
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:38,079
Just want to run away but

224
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:39,103
But you can't run away

225
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:40,639
Because the coming after the kids

226
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:42,175
Here's an example

227
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:44,735
McDonald's

228
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:52,927
This is got to be some

229
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:54,719
Next Level s***

230
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:56,511
That is

231
00:14:57,535 --> 00:14:58,303
Completely f*****

232
00:14:58,559 --> 00:14:59,071
His world.

233
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:07,007
Do you want to get to the story that you seemed like you had a thought

234
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:08,287
Let you know

235
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:10,847
Isn't his version of running away not

236
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:12,639
Talking about the news at all

237
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:15,967
So when he says he wants to run away but you can't

238
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:17,759
I mean he is

239
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:19,807
It's a constant active

240
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:21,343
Running away

241
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:28,255
Whose life is just a cop

242
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:32,095
I'm going to look over here

243
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:35,935
Is a complicated game of Escape

244
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:37,471
He does

245
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:39,007
Dictate sort of the ACT

246
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:40,031
Of pretending

247
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:42,335
Discover something is his way of Escape

248
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:45,407
He's just he's just an Escapist

249
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:47,455
Performance

250
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:48,223
Kind of

251
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:49,503
So here's a good way to

252
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:55,135
Text

253
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:56,159
Accidentally

254
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:58,463
Lobster here's the story that he's trying

255
00:15:58,719 --> 00:15:59,487
Cover

256
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:00,511
Is ground shake

257
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:02,815
If this is a pretty big deal

258
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:07,167
Bubonic plague leprosy drug-resistant TV

259
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:13,311
It's spreading into children everywhere

260
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:15,871
California

261
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:20,991
Leprosy

264
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:28,671
Coming up next shower

265
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:32,767
San Francisco's watching

266
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:38,143
Restaurant where you eat was you at your table

267
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:42,751
She can enjoy the Ambiance of the rats and celebrate

268
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:44,543
Just kidding infestation

269
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:47,359
Don't worry

270
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:49,919
Cesar rescue rats

Sunshine

275
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:04,255
Good read

276
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:08,863
Let's eat with rats

277
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:11,423
How to lower ourselves

278
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:14,239
Do you like that

279
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:16,031
God

280
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:19,615
This Force doesn't like that

281
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:21,919
Jealousy

282
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:23,455
Jealousy

283
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:26,783
Head

284
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:29,599
Human so they want us to eat with rats

285
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:36,511
Okay alright alright this is a little bit out of left field saying but I like that your I like the

286
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:42,911
Still brainstorming very creative

287
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:47,775
Crafty Old Scratch

288
00:17:48,031 --> 00:17:53,663
Up to his tricks again a medieval times but with rapping

289
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:56,735
Whatever

290
00:17:56,991 --> 00:17:57,759
Point very

291
00:17:58,015 --> 00:17:58,527
Seriously

292
00:17:58,783 --> 00:17:59,295
Before I get out of it

293
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:01,855
Alex Jones is so pathetic

294
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:04,927
In 2019

295
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:10,303
Ifucking restaurant where they got a bunch of rats running around it somehow celebration of a globalist

296
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:14,655
Are giving kids a leprosy or some s*** Next Level laser

297
00:18:15,167 --> 00:18:21,311
This legitimately just alyx looking over a list of like 50 headlines and some kind of a weird news aggregator

298
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:24,127
Hey picking out the ones that he feels natural in his voice

299
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:25,407
Then just riffing on it

300
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:26,175
That's all

301
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:26,943
He's doing here

302
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:28,223
This is his workflow

303
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:34,623
And you know that because he knows literally nothing about the stories covering except the surface-level s*** that you get from a headline

304
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:36,415
Hero rats in a bar in San

305
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:37,183
Francisco

306
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:37,951
Woo

307
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:42,815

308
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:43,583
From June 13th

309
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:44,351
Jeep 215

310
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:51,007
It's not it's not a bunch of restaurants it one

311
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:52,031
Pop up

312
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:58,431
A group called the San Francisco dungeon which is Alex it looked into it is basically a mini theme park at Fisher

313
00:18:58,687 --> 00:18:59,199
Gwar

314
00:18:59,455 --> 00:19:01,247
The big tourist destination in San Francisco

315
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:03,039
Includes

316
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:03,807
The bunch of

317
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:08,671
Barriers where actors portray characters to give customers the immersive Theatre Experience

318
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:12,511
Most of the rooms to pick famous aspects of San Francisco History

319
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:14,559
Like two of them are about the gold rush

320
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:18,911
But not necessarily about the glamorous

321
00:19:19,423 --> 00:19:21,215
Recreation of Alcatraz

322
00:19:21,471 --> 00:19:23,263
A1 dedicated to the outbreak

323
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:24,543
The plague in Chinatown

324
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:28,895
There's even one experience at the golfer called Shanghai Kelly's boat ride

325
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:32,479
Where you learned about the lives of people who were sold as slaves

326
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:37,343
So they're putting on the ramp bar as a supplemental thing to their other attractions

327
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:40,927
And it's meant to recreate the experience of being in a saloon back in the time

328
00:19:41,183 --> 00:19:42,207
Before

329
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:43,487
And all that kind

330
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:48,095
Honestly it seems like a little bit of a PR stunt to me but who knows I could see haven't

331
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:50,911
I'm not so jaded that I couldn't

332
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:57,311
Agree to go along to an escape room or something like that and someone invited me I'll never come up with the idea

333
00:19:57,567 --> 00:19:58,847
I would probably say yes

334
00:19:59,103 --> 00:20:01,663
Same thing with rat bar

335
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:06,783
Also they did the same thing last year when they open something called the rat

336
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:12,159
The only review I can find it at said it was disappointing and there was not enough contact with the rat

337
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:18,047
Tuesday like you might not know what these people are up to

338
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:19,071
Search

339
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:26,751
If your head

340
00:20:30,591 --> 00:20:31,871
Hello

341
00:20:32,127 --> 00:20:32,639
Yeah

342
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:37,503
Animal cruelty

343
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:43,903
Storyworth covering

344
00:20:44,415 --> 00:20:45,695
He's in a fight to the death

345
00:20:46,207 --> 00:20:47,999
China

346
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:50,815
But he's going to spend any of the globalist

347
00:20:51,071 --> 00:20:55,679
She tried to normalize leprosy by opening a novelty bar for 2 days where adults go play with rats

348
00:20:56,191 --> 00:20:58,239
What the f*** is he doing is he forgotten

349
00:20:58,495 --> 00:21:04,127
How intensely he decried attacks them

350
00:21:04,383 --> 00:21:05,663
So stupid

351
00:21:07,711 --> 00:21:08,991
It's crazy

352
00:21:10,015 --> 00:21:12,319
Is Jesse have a trip coming up

353
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:18,208
Is there any reason why you might be phoning it in this early like as is he doing anything

354
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:21,536
I have no idea I know that he has

355
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:23,840
Like another Sandy Hook deposition coming up

356
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:24,864
Next month

357
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:27,168
Cases are proceeding

358
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:31,520
So maybe he has that Sword of Damocles hanging over his head but like

359
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:33,568
I don't know I mean

360
00:21:33,824 --> 00:21:39,968
Intermittent vacation never know until Owen Shroyer just shows up so I'll be

361
00:21:41,248 --> 00:21:43,808
I don't I don't know but like I was

362
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,856
The lead-up to that of like

363
00:21:46,112 --> 00:21:49,440
It's so f****** awful to look at the news but you asked

364
00:21:49,696 --> 00:21:51,488
Bar

365
00:21:52,768 --> 00:21:55,584
Whiplash

366
00:21:56,096 --> 00:22:02,240
I love it on something if he is

367
00:22:02,496 --> 00:22:08,640
Local access new store

368
00:22:10,688 --> 00:22:12,480
Like that's his version of being like

369
00:22:12,736 --> 00:22:17,344
Example of

370
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:19,648
This is the dude

371
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:21,440
Terrible Eddie Musk

372
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:23,232
Avoid looking at

373
00:22:25,536 --> 00:22:26,304
You know you know

374
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:30,656
College I got hired to write Ford like this

375
00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:31,680

376
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:32,448
College

377
00:22:33,216 --> 00:22:34,240
Upstart

378
00:22:35,008 --> 00:22:35,520
Blog

379
00:22:36,032 --> 00:22:38,592
There's like a collection of blogs a different University

380
00:22:43,456 --> 00:22:46,528
It was horrible for long

381
00:22:46,784 --> 00:22:47,552
And they never ended up

382
00:22:48,064 --> 00:22:54,208
Universal experience with these sorts of things it was I would go

383
00:22:54,464 --> 00:23:00,608
Play I just find some sort of right about that

384
00:23:00,864 --> 00:23:03,168
Local paper for whatever headlines

385
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:04,960
This is going to be easy

386
00:23:05,472 --> 00:23:07,008
That's what Alex is doing

387
00:23:07,264 --> 00:23:10,592
He's using the workflow of a lazy f****** undergrad

388
00:23:11,104 --> 00:23:12,640
These are 40 f******

389
00:23:12,896 --> 00:23:17,248
5 year old man with a millions of dollars in a professional studio

390
00:23:18,016 --> 00:23:18,784
Can't be bothered

391
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:22,624
He can't be bothered to know what the San Francisco dungeon

392
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:23,904
He thinks it's a dungeon

393
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,488
Yab

394
00:23:27,744 --> 00:23:29,792
Man that sounds like a good place to be

395
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:37,984
He's doing his job poorly and making more money

396
00:23:41,568 --> 00:23:44,384
Not be the most Pleasant

397
00:23:45,152 --> 00:23:45,920
I'm surprised

398
00:23:46,432 --> 00:23:46,944
Just started

399
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:54,112
Shipping stuff to some other country of Rihanna loud and that way that way you can just on a dime

400
00:23:54,368 --> 00:24:00,512
Bolsonaro so much tired of freighters

401
00:24:00,768 --> 00:24:02,048
So

402
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:05,120
In this next clip we get to another news story

403
00:24:05,376 --> 00:24:10,240
It's not just Iraq cafes

404
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,592
But there are other stories

405
00:24:15,104 --> 00:24:16,128
And here's one of them

406
00:24:16,384 --> 00:24:17,152
And I

407
00:24:19,456 --> 00:24:22,016
What is the latest news wars.com

408
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:26,880
Love has no filter

409
00:24:27,904 --> 00:24:29,952
That's right

410
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:32,512
Video

411
00:24:33,024 --> 00:24:36,608
Love has no age

412
00:24:41,216 --> 00:24:42,752
Pepperidge Farm

413
00:24:43,264 --> 00:24:46,848
30 years ago Howard Stern making jokes about November

414
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:04,256
Love has no age

415
00:25:05,536 --> 00:25:07,840
North American man boy

416
00:25:08,352 --> 00:25:09,120
The slogan

417
00:25:12,448 --> 00:25:13,984
Pedophile organization

418
00:25:19,616 --> 00:25:20,128
Cool

419
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,944
This is

420
00:25:26,272 --> 00:25:29,600
Snapchat filter about love

421
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:33,440
Who makes statements the filter does it make

422
00:25:33,696 --> 00:25:35,488
Pop up on the video on the screen

423
00:25:35,744 --> 00:25:38,560
Including love has no gender love has no disability

424
00:25:38,816 --> 00:25:41,376
Love has no sexuality

425
00:25:41,632 --> 00:25:43,936
Love has no religion has no age

426
00:25:44,192 --> 00:25:46,496
Wichita

427
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:54,944
Naturally this is taken as an endorsement of pedophilia and now Alex's beta deleting story

428
00:25:55,968 --> 00:25:58,016
The article

429
00:25:58,272 --> 00:26:04,416
Infowars was unable to reproduce the filter as of this writing on May Monday June 3rd

430
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:08,256
The filter was not available when search.

431
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:12,096
If possible Snapchat quiet

432
00:26:12,864 --> 00:26:19,008
Birthing but I suspect

433
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,032
That's my guy

434
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:26,432
Did you download it

435
00:26:26,688 --> 00:26:30,528
Right position I've always been tools

436
00:26:30,784 --> 00:26:36,928
As long as Snapchat existed I have eight

437
00:26:37,184 --> 00:26:40,000
I enjoy it 11

438
00:26:40,256 --> 00:26:43,072
Yeah probably

439
00:26:43,328 --> 00:26:45,120
If you search through Twitter you can find a couple

440
00:26:45,376 --> 00:26:47,936
Examples of people who have screenshot

441
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:49,728
I guess it was a real thing

442
00:26:51,264 --> 00:26:53,312
Distance going on today

443
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:58,688
Stories that reference this video all the news articles

444
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:02,272
Very heavy quotes news articles to talk about it

445
00:27:02,528 --> 00:27:05,856
They all references video put on Twitter by Ashley sing

446
00:27:06,112 --> 00:27:06,624
Claire

447
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:08,928
And she posted the video at 9

448
00:27:09,184 --> 00:27:10,208
P.m. on June 2nd

449
00:27:10,976 --> 00:27:15,840
Her video is tons of retweets and is without exception the one that is in all of the stories about the

450
00:27:16,096 --> 00:27:17,632
Infowars natural

451
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:18,656
Hey Big League

452
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:23,520
People have been posting screenshots of themselves with this filter sets at least 12 hours

453
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:25,056
Before she made her video

454
00:27:25,312 --> 00:27:27,104
But hers is the one that everyone

455
00:27:27,872 --> 00:27:29,152
And I think there's a clear reason why

456
00:27:30,176 --> 00:27:35,808
If you scroll through Ashley's timeline on Twitter you get a very strong indication that maybe she's a big old dumb dumb

457
00:27:36,064 --> 00:27:36,576
But

458
00:27:36,832 --> 00:27:37,344
Specifically

459
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:38,624
A very precise

460
00:27:39,136 --> 00:27:39,904
Kind of dumb

461
00:27:40,928 --> 00:27:45,280
Right next to her retweet about her expose like the article

462
00:27:48,608 --> 00:27:52,960
She's retreated a picture that one is going around of Mario and Luigi making out

463
00:27:57,056 --> 00:27:57,568
Dumb

464
00:27:57,824 --> 00:27:59,872
Fake outrage

465
00:28:00,128 --> 00:28:00,896
People on the right

466
00:28:01,408 --> 00:28:03,968
And she retweeted that picture with the caption

467
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:05,248
Express disapproval

468
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:09,088
God no

469
00:28:09,344 --> 00:28:13,952
There's constant pointless culture-war fake-out right rates camping

470
00:28:14,464 --> 00:28:15,488
Outposts on her

471
00:28:16,512 --> 00:28:18,560
Frequent trashing people like Lena Dunham

472
00:28:18,816 --> 00:28:19,840
And retweets of s***

473
00:28:21,632 --> 00:28:27,520
Overall it's exactly kind of account you would expect from someone who's trying to make their name in the exciting world of

474
00:28:28,544 --> 00:28:33,152
The only sites that have articles about her bulshit are sites like

475
00:28:33,664 --> 00:28:35,968
It's stupid right-wing Christian propaganda

476
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:36,992
So I really

477
00:28:37,248 --> 00:28:37,760
Question with

478
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:38,528
Going on here

479
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,832
Even leaving aside how clearly this

480
00:28:41,088 --> 00:28:46,208
Seems like an attempt for a budding young grifter to get her name on the map by stealing someone else's out there

481
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,768
I don't really see how this has anything to do with pedophilia

482
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:50,816
What are those

483
00:28:52,864 --> 00:28:54,656
Scriptures of love

484
00:28:54,912 --> 00:28:56,192
Listen protect

485
00:28:56,448 --> 00:28:56,960
Two classes of

486
00:28:57,728 --> 00:29:01,312
You can't discriminate against people based on disability or their gender a religion

487
00:29:01,824 --> 00:29:02,336
For example

488
00:29:06,944 --> 00:29:07,456
Like you

489
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:08,480
Pointed out

490
00:29:08,736 --> 00:29:09,248
Immediately

491
00:29:09,504 --> 00:29:11,296
You understand the f*** is going on

492
00:29:11,808 --> 00:29:14,880
The discrimination against the elderly what's going on

493
00:29:15,648 --> 00:29:17,184
I really can't find any evidence

494
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:20,000
Outside of right-wing media insisting

495
00:29:20,256 --> 00:29:24,096
That proves that love has no age is actually a slogan of

496
00:29:24,608 --> 00:29:27,168
Find proof that it's part of

497
00:29:27,424 --> 00:29:30,752
Call swarthy who won the Nobel Prize for literature

498
00:29:34,848 --> 00:29:38,688
There's a quote attributed to Pascal of Pascal's wager

499
00:29:43,808 --> 00:29:49,696
There's classical examples of people who are not my knowledge

500
00:29:50,208 --> 00:29:52,768
Passed out

501
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:56,096
There's also really popular book from 2011 about a Doppler

502
00:29:56,352 --> 00:29:58,144
Dog

503
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:58,912
But not wanting

504
00:29:59,424 --> 00:29:59,936
Just get puppies

505
00:30:00,192 --> 00:30:00,704
Azusa

506
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:01,728
Who's older dogs

507
00:30:01,984 --> 00:30:02,752
Need love too

508
00:30:05,312 --> 00:30:05,824
Prefer if that was

509
00:30:08,896 --> 00:30:10,176
It's just all about getting older.

510
00:30:10,432 --> 00:30:16,320
Typically when you find the words love has no age you're finding them in stories about elderly people getting married

511
00:30:16,576 --> 00:30:20,416
Like the 2015 CBS article about George Kirby

512
00:30:20,928 --> 00:30:24,256
Who got hitched at the ages of 191 respect

513
00:30:26,304 --> 00:30:29,120
Via headline is

514
00:30:29,888 --> 00:30:36,032
Story is Dory they found from the website Texas FM

515
00:30:36,288 --> 00:30:37,312
Exactly

516
00:30:37,568 --> 00:30:39,360
Being about

517
00:30:39,872 --> 00:30:41,408
Who got married at 87

518
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:42,432
4 years ago

519
00:30:43,456 --> 00:30:44,480
With very few exceptions

520
00:30:44,736 --> 00:30:46,016
Depression

521
00:30:46,272 --> 00:30:47,296
Lopez

522
00:30:47,552 --> 00:30:48,832
Discuss the elderly finding love

523
00:30:49,344 --> 00:30:51,136
And we can all agree that that's some heartwarming

524
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:56,000
What's up with R.Kelly song AJ number

525
00:30:56,256 --> 00:30:57,024
Which is very

526
00:30:58,048 --> 00:30:58,560
That's quite

527
00:30:59,072 --> 00:31:05,216
Downward looking perspective

528
00:31:07,264 --> 00:31:10,336
A little different

529
00:31:10,848 --> 00:31:14,688
I looked around I can't find any official slogan

530
00:31:14,944 --> 00:31:21,088
What is the official multiple slogan I don't know

531
00:31:21,344 --> 00:31:27,488
Being their official site

532
00:31:27,744 --> 00:31:31,584
Group it was a predecessor of Nampa called Dee Renee

533
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,376
And they had a slogan that was

534
00:31:33,888 --> 00:31:36,704
Quote sex by gear 8 or else it's too late

535
00:31:37,216 --> 00:31:43,360
Snapchat use that on a filter

536
00:31:43,616 --> 00:31:49,760
And Alex could find a little more of a middle craft

537
00:31:50,016 --> 00:31:53,600
It's not your slogan

538
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:56,672
Really

539
00:31:57,184 --> 00:32:00,256
In the way that Alex

540
00:32:00,768 --> 00:32:04,608
If you was talking about this in the mid-70s

541
00:32:06,656 --> 00:32:10,240
It's hard to even say that it's a real group

542
00:32:10,752 --> 00:32:12,544
A lot of this is thanks to lgbtq

543
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:15,616
Excluded from their work

544
00:32:15,872 --> 00:32:19,200
Which effectively crippled man blows ability to present themselves as

545
00:32:19,968 --> 00:32:24,832
Because they try to latch onto right ascend

546
00:32:25,088 --> 00:32:30,464
Okay I like young boys I'm a man this is a game

547
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:36,864
Is lgbtq

548
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,144
Exclusion for

549
00:32:41,216 --> 00:32:44,288
So they should be applauded for that

550
00:32:44,544 --> 00:32:46,080
By associating them

551
00:32:46,336 --> 00:32:47,104
With

552
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:49,664

00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:44,192
Over the years the FBI infiltrated the group Nablus fairly easily in

569
00:33:44,448 --> 00:33:44,960
Sting operation

570
00:33:45,216 --> 00:33:48,544
Read out that effectively made the group irrelevant as an organization

571
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:52,384
People who would have joined we're now too afraid to do so

572
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:55,200
Just lurk in sucked up corners of

573
00:33:55,456 --> 00:33:57,504
Internet

574
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:01,600
Groups of mailing list which can be hacked easily

575
00:34:02,368 --> 00:34:06,976
In 2016 device didn't investigation that found that does pretty much nothing

576
00:34:07,488 --> 00:34:08,768
Even a representative for an a

577
00:34:09,024 --> 00:34:11,072
Anti pedophile group called perverted-justice

578
00:34:11,328 --> 00:34:12,864
Express having no real interest

579
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:13,632
Send them anymore

580
00:34:14,144 --> 00:34:15,680
Because the face of the real threat

581
00:34:15,936 --> 00:34:17,216
The children is not an organized

582
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:18,752
Group like NAMBLA

583
00:34:19,008 --> 00:34:20,032
Elsewhere

584
00:34:21,056 --> 00:34:24,384
I think this is another example of Alex's being super lazy and relying on him

585
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:25,152
Information from

586
00:34:25,408 --> 00:34:26,432
Like 30 years ago

587
00:34:26,688 --> 00:34:27,712
The craft is correct

588
00:34:27,968 --> 00:34:28,480
Conspiracies

589
00:34:28,736 --> 00:34:29,248
Is very dumb

590
00:34:29,504 --> 00:34:30,528
Very bad it's job

591
00:34:30,784 --> 00:34:33,088
And I can't imagine anybody

592
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:36,160
Not recognizing what that filter was

593
00:34:36,416 --> 00:34:37,440
Unless they were trying

594
00:34:37,696 --> 00:34:39,488
Make a fake out

595
00:34:41,024 --> 00:34:44,096
Like if those other ones weren't there you got an

596
00:34:44,352 --> 00:34:47,168
That's weird they just had

597
00:34:47,424 --> 00:34:49,472
Because of religion disability

598
00:34:49,728 --> 00:34:50,240
Like

599
00:34:50,752 --> 00:34:51,776
Lyrics about protector

600
00:34:52,032 --> 00:34:52,544
Two classes

601
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:53,568
Ashley

602
00:34:53,824 --> 00:34:54,592
Claire is doing

603
00:34:55,104 --> 00:35:00,224
Is

604
00:35:00,736 --> 00:35:02,016
We're going around

605
00:35:02,272 --> 00:35:04,064
12 hours before she made her video

606
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,600
And to make sure video

607
00:35:05,856 --> 00:35:06,368
Falsely

608
00:35:06,624 --> 00:35:07,392
Characterizing this

609
00:35:07,648 --> 00:35:09,696
Is a pedophile sympathetic

610
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:14,048
And if you look at your timeline it's really clear that the motivation is probably too

611
00:35:14,304 --> 00:35:15,328
Space

612
00:35:15,584 --> 00:35:16,096
Enloe

613
00:35:16,352 --> 00:35:17,632
World that she swims in

614
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,704
And the story does kind of have a happy ending

615
00:35:21,216 --> 00:35:23,008
Yeah because of this manufactured outrage

616
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,312
Ashley Stewart

617
00:35:25,824 --> 00:35:29,408
And she was allowed to write her first call them with a byline for human events

618
00:35:29,664 --> 00:35:35,808
Alex's lawyer Robert Barnes is involved in

619
00:35:36,064 --> 00:35:41,440
That's not good work

620
00:35:41,952 --> 00:35:47,584
So I think you can kind of see what's going on here you have an enterprising grifter

621
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:48,864
Who is made her first

622
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:49,888
Dent in the world

623
00:35:50,656 --> 00:35:56,800
It's exciting I'm thrilled to see her

624
00:35:57,056 --> 00:35:59,872
Publicly that'll be great

625
00:36:00,128 --> 00:36:02,176
It's about how our life is ruined

626
00:36:02,432 --> 00:36:04,480
Get to play the cycle all over again congratulations

627
00:36:04,736 --> 00:36:07,552
Yeah she really should have watched the Laura Loomer stuff

628
00:36:07,808 --> 00:36:09,088
Maybe I should

629
00:36:09,344 --> 00:36:10,112
Change my life in

630
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:12,160
There's a cautionary Tale 2

631
00:36:12,416 --> 00:36:14,208
All of this stuff

632
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:16,768
So in the middle of show Alex

633
00:36:17,024 --> 00:36:17,792
Play the report

634
00:36:18,048 --> 00:36:18,816
From John bowne

635
00:36:21,632 --> 00:36:22,400
But this this

636
00:36:23,424 --> 00:36:25,472
F****** Special Report was really

637
00:36:25,728 --> 00:36:26,240
Big 4

638
00:36:27,008 --> 00:36:30,848
Because I think it put into focus a lot of the feelings that I have about Alex

639
00:36:31,616 --> 00:36:37,760
Watershed couple minutes

640
00:36:38,016 --> 00:36:41,600
Yeah I really did and I think it's

641
00:36:43,904 --> 00:36:45,696
Accidental and negative

642
00:36:45,952 --> 00:36:50,048
For Infowars surprise

643
00:36:50,304 --> 00:36:50,816
This

644
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:52,864
Special Report

645
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,144
He's mostly just

646
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:55,424
Old clips of Ali

647
00:36:55,936 --> 00:36:57,216
From back when he was on

648
00:36:59,264 --> 00:37:00,800
Turn on his early radio.

649
00:37:01,056 --> 00:37:06,432
Almost like this is your life

650
00:37:06,944 --> 00:37:07,456
To take him off

651
00:37:07,968 --> 00:37:13,600
Second part of it

652
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:17,184
Where Alex is talking about

653
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:18,464
Military

654
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:24,608
And listen to this compared to him yelling about a rat Cafe

655
00:37:26,656 --> 00:37:27,168
That

656
00:37:27,424 --> 00:37:28,960
Complicated

657
00:37:29,216 --> 00:37:30,496
Position is really important

658
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:33,568
We're now here in Southern California

659
00:37:33,824 --> 00:37:39,968
A little town called Victorville located

660
00:37:40,224 --> 00:37:45,344
Acquire the Air Force Base

661
00:38:01,728 --> 00:38:04,032
More Middleman

662
00:38:04,288 --> 00:38:06,080
For the Chinese military industrial

663
00:38:06,848 --> 00:38:11,712
This again is the first

664
00:38:11,968 --> 00:38:14,528
Facility to be built

665
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,576
Pretty restrained

666
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,160
On-site

667
00:38:20,416 --> 00:38:21,696
He's doing a Fieldpiece

668
00:38:21,952 --> 00:38:27,072
Yeah man got it sure seems like that's the guy you want to go back in time and talk to and be like hey

669
00:38:27,584 --> 00:38:29,120
Hey I'm going to show you this video

670
00:38:30,656 --> 00:38:31,680
And he's going to break down

671
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:35,520
I listen to this special report

672
00:38:35,776 --> 00:38:37,056
Special Report

673
00:38:37,312 --> 00:38:40,384
Honestly I thought it was the best worker John pounds done

674
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:43,968
Primarily

675
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:50,624
Edited all together

676
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:52,416
Reaction to this was astonishment

677
00:38:52,928 --> 00:38:55,232
It's so insane for Alex to play clips

678
00:38:58,816 --> 00:38:59,328
Deteriorated

679
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:00,864
You can hear it completely

680
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:02,400
Different person

681
00:39:02,656 --> 00:39:05,472
His voice is different his manner is different his

682
00:39:05,984 --> 00:39:08,288
Ability to present ideas

683
00:39:08,544 --> 00:39:11,360
Mpq them juxtaposed with his current state is a severe bummer

684
00:39:11,872 --> 00:39:14,688
If I were Alex watching I would probably start crying

685
00:39:15,968 --> 00:39:19,040
Yeah but even more importantly I really think

686
00:39:19,552 --> 00:39:20,320
Exact opposite

687
00:39:20,576 --> 00:39:21,344
Point that they're trying to

688
00:39:22,368 --> 00:39:24,160
It's being presented as a collection of insta

689
00:39:26,208 --> 00:39:31,584
Power over the entire course of his career

690
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:33,888
He wasn't afraid to talk about black helicopters

691
00:39:34,144 --> 00:39:37,216
He's calling out the Rockefellers and the Rothschilds before it was cool

692
00:39:37,984 --> 00:39:42,080
This is being presented as an explanation for now why he's being kicked on social media

693
00:39:42,336 --> 00:39:48,480
But all it really doesn't prove he's expressing in that video or categorical

694
00:39:50,784 --> 00:39:52,576
He would have been banned long ago

695
00:39:52,832 --> 00:39:55,648
Everybody was totally fine with it for years

696
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:58,464
David Rockefeller had no idea who Alex was

697
00:39:59,488 --> 00:40:00,768
You didn't give a s*** about it

698
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:02,816
Oz full of s*** in a little bit crazy

699
00:40:04,864 --> 00:40:06,912
Except for people who have way more important things

700
00:40:07,168 --> 00:40:10,240
To do with their time than sue him or pay him any attention

701
00:40:10,752 --> 00:40:12,288
And that status quo is

702
00:40:12,544 --> 00:40:13,568
Maintainable

703
00:40:14,336 --> 00:40:14,848
Then

704
00:40:15,616 --> 00:40:16,384
Conspiracies

705
00:40:17,152 --> 00:40:21,248
The conspiracy theories about fluoride about Waco about 9/11

706
00:40:21,504 --> 00:40:23,296
Those are all directed at the Powerstroke

707
00:40:24,064 --> 00:40:29,184
They may be misguided and wrong but on a fundamental level security

708
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:29,952
In the bush

709
00:40:30,208 --> 00:40:30,720
Inspiration

710
00:40:30,976 --> 00:40:33,792
In the conspiracy world is the equivalent of punching up

711
00:40:34,304 --> 00:40:37,632
I'm certain that it wasn't the first example of it but what

712
00:40:37,888 --> 00:40:38,656
Behaviorist related

713
00:40:38,912 --> 00:40:39,424
Sandy Hook

714
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:43,008
And his inability to accept responsibility

715
00:40:43,264 --> 00:40:46,080
Is because it's such an example of him taking his skills

716
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:50,176
Power structure

717
00:40:50,432 --> 00:40:51,712
Hey coming down hard on victim

718
00:40:52,224 --> 00:40:53,504
Whose loved ones have been murdered

719
00:40:54,272 --> 00:40:58,368
It's an ugly thing to see you watching the report

720
00:40:58,624 --> 00:40:59,648
Is what fuels differ

721
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:04,256
About the Alex likes we started doing this show

722
00:41:06,816 --> 00:41:08,352
In the end of 26

723
00:41:08,864 --> 00:41:09,632
You watching this

724
00:41:09,888 --> 00:41:10,912
Why I felt different

725
00:41:11,168 --> 00:41:12,448
For one I used to watch him

726
00:41:12,704 --> 00:41:13,984
Like it just after college

727
00:41:16,032 --> 00:41:16,800
It's that differ

728
00:41:17,824 --> 00:41:19,872
Everything is done

729
00:41:20,384 --> 00:41:26,272
General experience the earlier Alex Jones is way easier to listen to because victimizes people in power

730
00:41:26,528 --> 00:41:27,808
He's super unfair to them

731
00:41:28,064 --> 00:41:31,648
About what he's doing

732
00:41:31,904 --> 00:41:33,184
Easier to stomach

733
00:41:33,952 --> 00:41:35,232
At some point he stopped giving

734
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:39,584
He started victimizing powerless people and that's his stock-in-trade

735
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:42,912
Whether it's random members of the lgbtq

736
00:41:43,168 --> 00:41:43,680
Q community

737
00:41:43,936 --> 00:41:44,704
Whether it's Muslim

738
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,496
Victims of gun violence

739
00:41:48,032 --> 00:41:50,848
How is it they were David Rockefeller themselves

740
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:52,640
And that's what's gotten him into trouble

741
00:41:53,407 --> 00:41:56,223
That's what this John bowne report accidentally makes total

742
00:41:56,479 --> 00:41:56,991
Clear

743
00:41:57,247 --> 00:41:58,783
Alex's imagined enemies

744
00:41:59,039 --> 00:42:01,599
Punches at them

745
00:42:01,855 --> 00:42:02,879
And make a living off his body

746
00:42:03,391 --> 00:42:05,183
Doesn't like bullies

747
00:42:05,695 --> 00:42:06,207
And that's what he's

748
00:42:07,487 --> 00:42:09,023
I know that no one's paying as close attention

749
00:42:11,327 --> 00:42:12,863
Created a damning indictment of our

750
00:42:13,631 --> 00:42:17,983
His b******* about the Chinese and the globalist need to get him off the air because he's critical of them

751
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:19,263
Is undercut biased

752
00:42:19,519 --> 00:42:21,823
Compilation including clips of him shiting on China

753
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:23,615
Way back in the VHS days

754
00:42:24,127 --> 00:42:26,175
He's b******* about the EU and you and being a

755
00:42:26,431 --> 00:42:26,943
Afraid of him

756
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:30,271
And always criticism is undercut by prove them always criticize

757
00:42:31,807 --> 00:42:37,951
He even includes footage of him exposing the truth Globus false flags at a point where he was left alone and allowed to grow as big

758
00:42:38,463 --> 00:42:39,487
For 15 more years

759
00:42:40,511 --> 00:42:42,047
What I'm getting at

760
00:42:42,303 --> 00:42:43,583
Report but it really

761
00:42:44,607 --> 00:42:46,143
Made so clear to me

762
00:42:46,655 --> 00:42:48,703
Is the crystalline differ

763
00:42:49,215 --> 00:42:51,775
Of why it's so much more palatable

764
00:42:52,031 --> 00:42:52,543
Go back

765
00:42:52,799 --> 00:42:53,567
2009

766
00:42:53,823 --> 00:42:54,591
Wayback

767
00:42:54,847 --> 00:42:55,871
It's so clear

768
00:42:56,383 --> 00:42:57,407
Keep punching up

769
00:42:57,663 --> 00:43:01,759
Yeah and I don't know Sandy Hook is the exact Line in the Sand

770
00:43:02,271 --> 00:43:03,295
When everything changed

771
00:43:03,551 --> 00:43:04,575
He started punch

772
00:43:06,367 --> 00:43:08,927
I think that's why I'm so interested in that

773
00:43:09,183 --> 00:43:09,695
As a Time

774
00:43:09,951 --> 00:43:11,487
. and why I'm sticking with it

775
00:43:11,999 --> 00:43:14,303
Victor 2009

776
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:16,607
Invicta rise of the tea party stuff

777
00:43:17,375 --> 00:43:17,887
Became such a

778
00:43:18,143 --> 00:43:18,911
Warm-baths

779
00:43:19,167 --> 00:43:20,191
2B hair

780
00:43:20,447 --> 00:43:23,263
Harsh differences present

781
00:43:26,591 --> 00:43:27,871
Even from what we've seen

782
00:43:28,383 --> 00:43:29,151
In the 23rd

783
00:43:29,407 --> 00:43:30,175
Investigation

784
00:43:30,943 --> 00:43:32,223
Sandy Hook

785
00:43:32,991 --> 00:43:33,503
Changing point

786
00:43:34,015 --> 00:43:36,575
He had that caller on one of those Monday episode

787
00:43:36,831 --> 00:43:38,111
Who was trying to get him

788
00:43:38,367 --> 00:43:40,415
To talk about Robbie Parker being an actor

789
00:43:42,207 --> 00:43:43,999
Responded

790
00:43:44,255 --> 00:43:47,583
I'm not talking about someone whose family died

791
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:49,631
Kid got murdered

792
00:43:50,143 --> 00:43:50,911
The fact

793
00:43:52,959 --> 00:43:54,239
Is such a marked difference

794
00:43:57,823 --> 00:44:01,151
I don't know they don't take John to those thoughts

795
00:44:05,247 --> 00:44:06,015
To that was

796
00:44:07,039 --> 00:44:08,319
It was a ride

797
00:44:08,831 --> 00:44:09,599
He had bounced

798
00:44:09,855 --> 00:44:11,647
Seems to have created a

799
00:44:12,671 --> 00:44:13,183
Clip

800
00:44:13,695 --> 00:44:15,999
An edited video of all the reason

801
00:44:16,255 --> 00:44:17,535
That Alex wasn't kicked off

802
00:44:24,447 --> 00:44:27,519
You know where you could have saw those when they were made

803
00:44:27,775 --> 00:44:33,919
Suspicious

804
00:44:44,415 --> 00:44:45,439
I appreciate his voice

805
00:44:45,695 --> 00:44:46,207
Not really being in it

806
00:44:47,231 --> 00:44:48,767
Double hats

807
00:44:49,023 --> 00:44:49,535
That is

808
00:44:50,047 --> 00:44:50,815
Because

809
00:44:51,071 --> 00:44:55,167
If you weren't kicked off social media right now and that same clip show work

810
00:44:55,423 --> 00:44:55,935
To be made

811
00:44:56,191 --> 00:44:57,471
I'm like if you weren't being sued by

812
00:44:57,727 --> 00:44:58,751
Sandy Hook or or anything

813
00:45:00,031 --> 00:45:03,615
He would almost certainly have all of the false

814
00:45:05,151 --> 00:45:07,199
Because that's part of why the 11th

815
00:45:07,455 --> 00:45:08,479
America

816
00:45:11,039 --> 00:45:15,903
We talked for a long time

817
00:45:16,159 --> 00:45:20,511
Have any of that stuff

818
00:45:21,535 --> 00:45:22,815
It's clear

819
00:45:23,327 --> 00:45:23,839
It's so clear

820
00:45:24,351 --> 00:45:24,863
So clear

821
00:45:29,471 --> 00:45:29,983
Respect

822
00:45:30,239 --> 00:45:31,263
Define

823
00:45:31,519 --> 00:45:33,055
When I jumped in on this episode

824
00:45:33,311 --> 00:45:35,103
Cuz it certainly wasn't

825
00:45:37,407 --> 00:45:43,551
The Noir was there at Cafe

826
00:45:43,807 --> 00:45:45,343
Alex

827
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:47,647
Jumps a new narrative

828
00:45:55,583 --> 00:45:56,095
Should Wild

829
00:45:57,119 --> 00:45:58,399
He remembers something

830
00:45:59,679 --> 00:46:00,191
He read

831
00:46:01,983 --> 00:46:06,591
The past shouldn't be allowed to remember things

832
00:46:06,847 --> 00:46:11,455
The last 45 minutes since I saw these two articles videos

833
00:46:11,967 --> 00:46:15,039
Defy

834
00:46:16,063 --> 00:46:20,671
There's just so much

835
00:46:21,695 --> 00:46:23,487
It was a vice piece

836
00:46:23,743 --> 00:46:24,767
T-shirt

837
00:46:26,047 --> 00:46:27,839
It was about 2 years ago

838
00:46:28,863 --> 00:46:31,167
Better. She was an actress but she really did it

839
00:46:31,935 --> 00:46:36,287
Something like five shares piece of woman saying abortion feels good in

840
00:46:38,591 --> 00:46:41,151
And she's doing a fake orgasm

841
00:46:41,663 --> 00:46:47,807
Wilder killing a baby going

842
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:50,367
So this

843
00:46:50,623 --> 00:46:53,439
Is an interesting memory that Alex has

844
00:46:53,695 --> 00:46:54,975
Of source material

845
00:46:55,487 --> 00:46:58,559
Doesn't formed a bit of his rhetoric about abortion

846
00:47:00,095 --> 00:47:06,239
I think we can agree that this isn't too far afield from some of the stuff you normally says

847
00:47:06,495 --> 00:47:07,263
Coming out

848
00:47:07,519 --> 00:47:08,543
With this

849
00:47:08,799 --> 00:47:13,919
I would really want to know exactly what I was referencing I would not want to come out with

850
00:47:14,175 --> 00:47:15,199
Some b******* like

851
00:47:15,455 --> 00:47:20,319
This lady is having an orgasm while getting an abortion and say I think I remember something

852
00:47:20,831 --> 00:47:23,903
From all of my abilities

853
00:47:24,415 --> 00:47:24,927
Stop looking at

854
00:47:27,743 --> 00:47:28,511
Use conflating

855
00:47:29,535 --> 00:47:31,583
Get into that but here Alex

856
00:47:32,095 --> 00:47:33,119
Released

857
00:47:33,375 --> 00:47:33,887
Figure out what

858
00:47:34,143 --> 00:47:34,911
What he's thinking about

859
00:47:35,679 --> 00:47:40,543
What am I thinking of you got to find that

860
00:47:41,823 --> 00:47:45,919
Abortion table

861
00:47:48,223 --> 00:47:49,759
How wonderful it was not right one

862
00:47:50,015 --> 00:47:51,295
Hoping the system

863
00:47:51,551 --> 00:47:54,623
Woodland Caster in bigger roles

864
00:48:01,791 --> 00:48:02,303
So

865
00:48:02,815 --> 00:48:04,863
Memories are weird

866
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:06,143
Certainly

867
00:48:06,655 --> 00:48:08,959
Sacrifice

868
00:48:10,239 --> 00:48:14,591
Both equally satanic things to do with the red doesn't

869
00:48:14,847 --> 00:48:15,359
You're just

870
00:48:15,615 --> 00:48:21,759
You can hang your not where the

871
00:48:22,015 --> 00:48:22,527
Price of baby

872
00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:26,623
Turns out

873
00:48:27,647 --> 00:48:29,183
So Alex

874
00:48:29,695 --> 00:48:35,839
He has this vague memory of something we're like women are orgasmically enjoying abortion

875
00:48:36,607 --> 00:48:38,911
And he finds

876
00:48:39,167 --> 00:48:39,935
The article

877
00:48:40,191 --> 00:48:43,519
Betty's

878
00:48:44,031 --> 00:48:44,543
Forum

879
00:48:46,591 --> 00:48:47,871
Is one of the crazier thing

880
00:48:48,383 --> 00:48:49,407
But I think I've ever heard

881
00:48:50,175 --> 00:48:52,735
Abortion

882
00:48:53,247 --> 00:48:55,039
It's not just because I'm killing a baby

883
00:48:55,551 --> 00:48:57,343
So he's going to read this article

884
00:48:57,599 --> 00:48:58,111
But also

885
00:48:58,367 --> 00:48:59,135
You heard that

886
00:48:59,391 --> 00:49:00,159
There it is

887
00:49:00,671 --> 00:49:04,767
Yeah there is a sense of familiarity and I think that's incredibly important

888
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:09,119
There's actually nerve centers in the back of the uterus

889
00:49:10,143 --> 00:49:12,191
I can be stimulated to regular intercourse

890
00:49:12,959 --> 00:49:15,263
Wow they're fetishizing killing babies

891
00:49:18,847 --> 00:49:19,871
To visit a clinic

892
00:49:20,895 --> 00:49:22,431
Have my vagina

893
00:49:25,503 --> 00:49:30,623
Speculated scooped out like the bottom of a big cherry pie

894
00:49:32,159 --> 00:49:32,671
On

895
00:49:34,975 --> 00:49:37,279
Pictures of satanic panic

896
00:49:37,535 --> 00:49:41,375
I'm a stupid baby

897
00:49:42,911 --> 00:49:43,679
Do you found it

898
00:49:44,447 --> 00:49:45,983
Let's go back

899
00:49:49,823 --> 00:49:50,591
So

900
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:53,407
That article is

901
00:49:54,687 --> 00:49:56,735
That's that

902
00:49:56,991 --> 00:49:57,759
ReadWorks

903
00:49:58,015 --> 00:49:59,807
It's like that

904
00:50:00,575 --> 00:50:04,159
I will get you to Alex start talking about these demons

905
00:50:04,415 --> 00:50:09,535
Because he has to wait for his remember what

906
00:50:10,303 --> 00:50:13,119
I would prefer it if I never heard him say the word coming again

907
00:50:13,375 --> 00:50:19,519
Cuz that really don't want to do that could you cut that out

908
00:50:21,823 --> 00:50:22,335
I can't

909
00:50:25,407 --> 00:50:26,943
Which does exist

910
00:50:27,199 --> 00:50:27,711
As an article

911
00:50:31,295 --> 00:50:32,319
We find out

912
00:50:32,575 --> 00:50:33,087
The demons

913
00:50:33,855 --> 00:50:34,367
How to do a certain

914
00:50:34,623 --> 00:50:35,903
Something that Alex

915
00:50:36,159 --> 00:50:37,695
Talk about a whole lot

916
00:50:38,975 --> 00:50:40,511
Alex seems to know what happens

917
00:50:40,767 --> 00:50:41,279
If you do what

918
00:50:41,535 --> 00:50:42,303
These demons say

919
00:50:42,815 --> 00:50:45,119
This makes me really convinced Alex killed his dog

920
00:50:52,799 --> 00:50:53,567
Getaround

921
00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:56,639
Satanist are in trailer park still under dog

922
00:50:58,943 --> 00:50:59,967
So I can see demons

923
00:51:00,223 --> 00:51:02,015
Which bottle I do

924
00:51:02,783 --> 00:51:03,807
What

925
00:51:04,063 --> 00:51:06,623
What

926
00:51:07,903 --> 00:51:09,439
Helicopters

927
00:51:11,231 --> 00:51:13,279
For not very long

928
00:51:13,535 --> 00:51:14,559
Are they just wanted to know

929
00:51:14,815 --> 00:51:16,863
That's like they gone to the Rock Cafe

930
00:51:19,935 --> 00:51:25,055
I don't know how you know that when you kill your dog to evens pop up until you to do really bad thing

931
00:51:25,311 --> 00:51:31,455
And not only that but you just threw it

932
00:51:31,711 --> 00:51:37,855
Demons do pop up from

933
00:51:40,159 --> 00:51:42,719
The problem

934
00:51:42,975 --> 00:51:44,255
He specifically pointing out

935
00:51:44,511 --> 00:51:49,887
It's not the lsbpie accidentally killing

936
00:51:50,143 --> 00:51:50,911
He's just

937
00:51:51,167 --> 00:51:52,959
Hey by the way

938
00:51:53,983 --> 00:51:55,263
It also seems weird because

939
00:52:01,663 --> 00:52:03,455
Man that's no good

940
00:52:04,735 --> 00:52:05,503
So convince

941
00:52:06,015 --> 00:52:06,527
Kill dogs

942
00:52:06,783 --> 00:52:12,671
Like it just it does kind of occupations

943
00:52:12,927 --> 00:52:14,463
I just started out as a joke

944
00:52:14,975 --> 00:52:18,815
When I asked

945
00:52:19,071 --> 00:52:21,631
And now I think we all know where no

946
00:52:21,887 --> 00:52:22,399
D.

947
00:52:22,655 --> 00:52:24,447
Investigation

948
00:52:24,703 --> 00:52:30,079
Michael Vick of the right-wing media

949
00:52:30,335 --> 00:52:30,847
I don't know

950
00:52:35,199 --> 00:52:36,223
The bortion

951
00:52:36,479 --> 00:52:40,319
Derisively because when I tell you what's going on here

952
00:52:40,831 --> 00:52:42,623
Not something that needs to be taken seriously

953
00:52:42,879 --> 00:52:43,647
But Alex

954
00:52:43,903 --> 00:52:44,415
Is taking this

955
00:52:44,671 --> 00:52:45,183
Quite series

956
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:51,839
Having orgasm

957
00:52:52,607 --> 00:52:57,727
Lindsey Cooper 2

958
00:52:57,983 --> 00:53:00,031
Came out of my plane

959
00:53:02,591 --> 00:53:08,735
Come really hard when I get an abortion

960
00:53:14,111 --> 00:53:20,255
Please stop that

961
00:53:20,511 --> 00:53:26,655
Especially the bottom of injury

962
00:53:27,935 --> 00:53:29,983
Deliberating

963
00:53:30,495 --> 00:53:32,031
Adrenaline rush

964
00:53:33,823 --> 00:53:34,847
Jumping

965
00:53:35,871 --> 00:53:38,431
Snapchatting

966
00:53:39,199 --> 00:53:44,319
Opportunity to go to his other narrative

967
00:53:51,487 --> 00:53:53,023
Final equation

968
00:53:54,559 --> 00:53:59,679
They give their children the fires of Molech and Baal

969
00:53:59,935 --> 00:54:03,263
He even changed his tone of voice dimensional transmission control system

970
00:54:04,543 --> 00:54:09,663
They're falling like why are they doing this

971
00:54:11,455 --> 00:54:13,759
Because their spirit

972
00:54:14,271 --> 00:54:17,087
That might be true for you

973
00:54:34,495 --> 00:54:39,359
Hunter's Pandora heartbreak

974
00:54:42,943 --> 00:54:49,087
This article that Alex's reading on are as evidence that women are sexualized

975
00:54:50,879 --> 00:54:57,023
Is it supposed to snow today

976
00:54:58,047 --> 00:55:03,167
Starting in July 2013 and started posting articles that are clearly satire

977
00:55:03,423 --> 00:55:05,215
On this Thought Catalog page

978
00:55:05,727 --> 00:55:07,519
His first article headline is quote

979
00:55:07,775 --> 00:55:11,359
Gay stuff homophobic is disrespectful to people with phobias

980
00:55:12,383 --> 00:55:18,271
The articles are so clearly trolling literally zero investigation

981
00:55:19,039 --> 00:55:20,319
Here are some of his other head

982
00:55:21,087 --> 00:55:26,207
Tell Chinese people that new years was a month ago

983
00:55:26,463 --> 00:55:28,767
Quote is anyone else man poop is brown

984
00:55:29,279 --> 00:55:32,095
You know who didn't complain about minimum wage

985
00:55:32,351 --> 00:55:33,119
But slaves

986
00:55:33,631 --> 00:55:35,679
Better one

987
00:55:36,191 --> 00:55:38,751
Shows racists are more likely to reput bake

988
00:55:42,335 --> 00:55:44,383
Anything on this blog are complete

989
00:55:48,735 --> 00:55:53,343
But their purported evidence for the dumb f*** point is actually parody of people who are

990
00:55:53,599 --> 00:55:55,647
Really really turned on by that

991
00:55:55,903 --> 00:55:59,231
Justify

992
00:56:02,815 --> 00:56:08,959
Allenport subgroup excited

993
00:56:09,471 --> 00:56:12,287
I know it's a lot of effort to just click

994
00:56:16,127 --> 00:56:16,895
The block

995
00:56:17,407 --> 00:56:21,759
I can't expect someone who professes to be an expert very smart and able to read

996
00:56:22,015 --> 00:56:22,783
Before he reports

997
00:56:23,039 --> 00:56:23,551
I think so I'm not going to

998
00:56:27,391 --> 00:56:29,183
Is unnecessary

999
00:56:29,439 --> 00:56:32,511
That's f****** article itself is so clearly satire

1000
00:56:32,767 --> 00:56:33,535
He just jumps

1001
00:56:33,791 --> 00:56:34,303
The page

1002
00:56:34,559 --> 00:56:37,887
Hear some parts

1003
00:56:38,143 --> 00:56:41,471
If I actually read that you're going to have to read it like

1004
00:56:41,727 --> 00:56:45,311
You fellows are you fellows in our little secret

1005
00:56:45,567 --> 00:56:48,127
Women's mammograms to prevent breast cancer

1006
00:56:48,383 --> 00:56:54,015
We get them because it feels good to have RTD

1007
00:56:56,063 --> 00:56:59,391
If you read that text

1008
00:57:00,159 --> 00:57:03,231
Liberal Liberal

1009
00:57:09,887 --> 00:57:13,983
Getting abortions orgasms during the procedure

1010
00:57:14,239 --> 00:57:18,591
Let me ask you this if it was wrong and unnatural why am I squirting

1011
00:57:26,015 --> 00:57:32,159
There's a whole part about doctors who would molest women it to treat hysteria back in the day

1012
00:57:38,047 --> 00:57:39,839
Anyways

1013
00:57:41,631 --> 00:57:43,679
It's really funny to see Alec be this

1014
00:57:43,935 --> 00:57:44,447
Huge

1015
00:57:44,703 --> 00:57:45,471
An idiot you know like

1016
00:57:46,495 --> 00:57:48,287
He clearly reinforces what's become like

1017
00:57:48,543 --> 00:57:51,615
Kasim on the show lately

1018
00:57:52,127 --> 00:57:53,663
He doesn't know anything

1019
00:57:53,919 --> 00:57:56,735
But I think there's something really scary that this

1020
00:57:56,991 --> 00:57:57,503
Suggest

1021
00:57:57,759 --> 00:58:02,111
This article by Nicole Mullen was posted on February 12th 2014

1022
00:58:02,367 --> 00:58:04,415
To be unfamiliar with

1023
00:58:06,463 --> 00:58:12,351
It seems to know of this article 23 years ago by Vice except

1024
00:58:15,423 --> 00:58:19,519
Show a really sounds like he's read this article years ago

1025
00:58:20,031 --> 00:58:23,103
There's an outside possibility

1026
00:58:23,359 --> 00:58:24,383
In some way

1027
00:58:24,639 --> 00:58:25,407
Portion

1028
00:58:25,663 --> 00:58:28,991
Are based on this very clearly troll

1029
00:58:31,551 --> 00:58:32,063
Call for a couple of

1030
00:58:32,575 --> 00:58:38,463
One question what level of prank or satire could be could be behind some of his other beliefs

1031
00:58:38,975 --> 00:58:41,023
But more importantly to

1032
00:58:41,279 --> 00:58:44,351
It demonstrates how far Through the Looking-Glass

1033
00:58:44,607 --> 00:58:47,935
Yes we are evil and f***** up thing someone who missing

1034
00:58:48,191 --> 00:58:50,751
Understand satire can do with that satire

1035
00:58:51,519 --> 00:58:56,127
I got a lot of messages from people asking me to cover this respected listeners wishes

1036
00:58:56,383 --> 00:58:57,151
I was happy to oblige

1037
00:58:57,663 --> 00:58:59,199
Story

1038
00:58:59,455 --> 00:59:00,991
How embarrassing

1039
00:59:02,271 --> 00:59:04,575
For Alex if you gave a s*** about anything

1040
00:59:04,831 --> 00:59:07,391
Is one of the most important aspects of these two days shows

1041
00:59:08,159 --> 00:59:10,207
It's fun to laugh at Alex and I fucken love doing

1042
00:59:10,463 --> 00:59:12,767
I've been listening to that clip of him yelling about Donuts

1043
00:59:13,023 --> 00:59:13,791
Repeatedly

1044
00:59:14,047 --> 00:59:15,327
Something recorded that episode

1045
00:59:17,631 --> 00:59:19,167
McKay's

1046
00:59:23,519 --> 00:59:25,823
. like that is missing the forest for the trees

1047
00:59:26,335 --> 00:59:31,967
I believe I expressed at the beginning this episode but that this show even without Alex

1048
00:59:32,479 --> 00:59:33,759
Clearpro blog post

1049
00:59:34,015 --> 00:59:34,783
Is one of the most

1050
00:59:35,039 --> 00:59:36,831
F*****-up detestable displays

1051
00:59:37,087 --> 00:59:38,879
But I've seen the last two-and-a-half years of doing this

1052
00:59:39,647 --> 00:59:41,183
Are clear indications that Alex

1053
00:59:41,695 --> 00:59:42,463
Actively trying to

1054
00:59:43,999 --> 00:59:44,511
He does not give a

1055
00:59:45,279 --> 00:59:46,047
And he uses

1056
00:59:46,303 --> 00:59:47,327
Some of this stuff

1057
00:59:47,583 --> 00:59:48,351
To reinforce the

1058
00:59:50,399 --> 00:59:55,775
About Alex getting

1059
00:59:56,031 --> 00:59:58,335
Going to get orgasm

1060
00:59:58,591 --> 01:00:00,383
Because it sexually pleasurable

1061
01:00:00,639 --> 01:00:03,455
It's funny to laugh and how bad of a job he's doing

1062
01:00:03,967 --> 01:00:05,759
It's important for us to listen to the rest

1063
01:00:06,527 --> 01:00:07,295
See where it goes

1064
01:00:08,319 --> 01:00:08,831
See how

1065
01:00:09,343 --> 01:00:11,135
What's the dangerous things

1066
01:00:11,391 --> 01:00:11,903
He builds on

1067
01:00:13,439 --> 01:00:16,511
Yeah you know maybe we shouldn't have taught some people how to read

1068
01:00:17,279 --> 01:00:18,047
You know what

1069
01:00:18,303 --> 01:00:24,447
It's an interesting thought

1070
01:00:24,703 --> 01:00:27,519
Rising the Irish because they ate so many babies

1071
01:00:28,031 --> 01:00:29,823
Like they didn't blow up Irish

1072
01:00:31,871 --> 01:00:34,431
The smattering of it

1073
01:00:34,687 --> 01:00:38,015
Sure they were just

1074
01:00:39,807 --> 01:00:45,951
The they didn't use them actually eating babies as a as an excuse they already hate him which is why

1075
01:00:46,207 --> 01:00:47,231
The satire whistle effect

1076
01:00:47,999 --> 01:00:49,279
Is because he was

1077
01:00:49,535 --> 01:00:50,815
Playing out with that

1078
01:00:53,631 --> 01:00:54,399
Unfortunately

1079
01:00:54,655 --> 01:00:55,935
Very close

1080
01:00:56,191 --> 01:01:00,031
Narrative

1081
01:01:00,287 --> 01:01:02,847
People who know about Nicole Mullen

1082
01:01:03,103 --> 01:01:05,151
Like they know that this is

1083
01:01:05,407 --> 01:01:09,247
Alex being f****** idiot never want to dance all over it

1084
01:01:10,783 --> 01:01:11,295
Dote

1085
01:01:11,551 --> 01:01:13,343
And there's no reason why Alex has

1086
01:01:13,599 --> 01:01:16,671
Any initiative or any reason to come on air

1087
01:01:16,927 --> 01:01:17,439
Hey guys

1088
01:01:17,695 --> 01:01:18,975
Really

1089
01:01:19,231 --> 01:01:22,815
Screwed up I feel right that was a troll blog

1090
01:01:23,071 --> 01:01:26,911
I got tricked

1091
01:01:27,167 --> 01:01:29,983
Sorry women are going to get abortions

1092
01:01:30,239 --> 01:01:31,775
Sorry guys

1093
01:01:32,031 --> 01:01:35,871
The correct itself

1094
01:01:36,127 --> 01:01:36,895
Not just continue

1095
01:01:37,151 --> 01:01:40,479
As if that's real

1096
01:01:40,991 --> 01:01:44,319
So before we get to what I was talking about how this is

1097
01:01:44,575 --> 01:01:45,599
This takes a turn toward

1098
01:01:48,927 --> 01:01:49,951
Pest duties

1099
01:01:50,207 --> 01:01:53,791
Videos about to slander Steve which never ends up doing

1100
01:01:56,607 --> 01:02:02,751
Representative

1101
01:02:03,007 --> 01:02:09,151
Also not

1102
01:02:10,175 --> 01:02:10,943
50

1103
01:02:11,199 --> 01:02:13,247
It's the author Steve King

1104
01:02:13,503 --> 01:02:14,015
Stephen King

1105
01:02:15,039 --> 01:02:18,367
I'm so confused

1106
01:02:18,623 --> 01:02:19,391
Oz

1107
01:02:19,903 --> 01:02:22,207
Never gets around to actually following

1108
01:02:22,463 --> 01:02:23,487
Through with this

1109
01:02:24,511 --> 01:02:26,047
In case you eventually does

1110
01:02:26,303 --> 01:02:29,887
So we know that it's very premeditated

1111
01:02:30,143 --> 01:02:30,655
Mist

1112
01:02:34,495 --> 01:02:38,079
I'm getting ready to come out

1113
01:02:39,103 --> 01:02:40,895
Tomorrow

1114
01:02:47,295 --> 01:02:49,343
In the stuff

1115
01:02:52,927 --> 01:02:53,695
Piece of crap

1116
01:02:54,207 --> 01:02:55,231
If you just talkin about Maine

1117
01:02:56,255 --> 01:02:57,279
Call piece of crap

1118
01:02:58,047 --> 01:02:59,583
Are all slaves the devil

1119
01:03:00,095 --> 01:03:04,447
So yeah sounds like he's talking about me information about Stephen

1120
01:03:04,703 --> 01:03:07,775
Stephen King's books that you'd only know if you were on the inside which

1121
01:03:08,031 --> 01:03:11,103
Comes off so f****** Halo after he reported on it

1122
01:03:13,151 --> 01:03:14,943
Your reading of Stephen King's books

1123
01:03:15,199 --> 01:03:15,711
I don't trust

1124
01:03:15,967 --> 01:03:16,991
I no longer Trust

1125
01:03:21,855 --> 01:03:22,623
He doesn't care either

1126
01:03:22,879 --> 01:03:27,231
He doesn't care what you say

1127
01:03:27,743 --> 01:03:30,047
I was on cocaine I was deeply it's cocaine

1128
01:03:30,303 --> 01:03:32,095
Maximum Overdrive

1129
01:03:32,351 --> 01:03:34,399
I am crazy

1130
01:03:35,423 --> 01:03:40,287
There's no reason why I go whatever accusations

1131
01:03:41,311 --> 01:03:42,079
Next

1132
01:03:42,847 --> 01:03:43,871
So we now

1133
01:03:44,127 --> 01:03:45,407
Almost immediately get to

1134
01:03:45,663 --> 01:03:46,431
This part where

1135
01:03:46,943 --> 01:03:47,967
Super duper

1136
01:03:52,063 --> 01:03:53,087
Chinese women come during abortion

1137
01:03:53,343 --> 01:03:56,159
And he's talking about how a lot of

1138
01:03:56,415 --> 01:03:57,695
People particularly Anderson

1139
01:03:57,951 --> 01:03:58,719
Cooper art

1140
01:03:58,975 --> 01:03:59,487
Possessed

1141
01:03:59,999 --> 01:04:00,511
And

1142
01:04:01,023 --> 01:04:02,815
It's all good

1143
01:04:03,071 --> 01:04:03,583
In his

1144
01:04:04,607 --> 01:04:05,119
Ballpark

1145
01:04:05,375 --> 01:04:07,167
The Anderson Cooper is

1146
01:04:07,423 --> 01:04:07,935
Yeah

1147
01:04:09,727 --> 01:04:15,871
How far have we gone off my back like water off a duck

1148
01:04:16,127 --> 01:04:22,271
Oh yeah

1149
01:04:22,783 --> 01:04:23,807
What are you talking about

1150
01:04:25,343 --> 01:04:26,879
Insane that should be

1151
01:04:27,135 --> 01:04:27,903
So interesting

1152
01:04:28,671 --> 01:04:31,231
Someone with the radio show called Gators and Cooper is even

1153
01:04:31,487 --> 01:04:35,839
That should be

1154
01:04:36,095 --> 01:04:42,239
Escalation vanilla and then all the sudden

1155
01:04:42,495 --> 01:04:44,287
DSM it takes two seconds

1156
01:04:47,359 --> 01:04:49,663
Escalating with the b******* millennials

1157
01:04:49,919 --> 01:04:54,015
Anderson Cooper's wrong two seconds later what are you going to do

1158
01:04:58,623 --> 01:04:59,391
It goes to this

1159
01:05:01,183 --> 01:05:01,951
Is

1160
01:05:02,975 --> 01:05:03,743
Man

1161
01:05:04,255 --> 01:05:05,791
This clip is 4 minutes long

1162
01:05:09,631 --> 01:05:10,655
The point but like

1163
01:05:10,911 --> 01:05:12,703
I kept I listen to this a couple times

1164
01:05:12,959 --> 01:05:14,239
Because I was trying to track like

1165
01:05:15,007 --> 01:05:16,031
Of his

1166
01:05:16,799 --> 01:05:17,823
Cuz they're so deeply Disturbed

1167
01:05:18,079 --> 01:05:21,407
Can I also was like well I could cut it to your return this

1168
01:05:21,663 --> 01:05:22,175
Eclipse

1169
01:05:22,431 --> 01:05:23,455
But I couldn't find place

1170
01:05:23,711 --> 01:05:24,223
Sister cut it

1171
01:05:24,479 --> 01:05:25,503
It's so deeply

1172
01:05:25,759 --> 01:05:26,271
He's booked up

1173
01:05:26,527 --> 01:05:28,063
If you trace his thoughts

1174
01:05:29,343 --> 01:05:29,855
I don't

1175
01:05:30,111 --> 01:05:31,135
I don't think this is legal

1176
01:05:31,391 --> 01:05:32,927
I really think that this is illegal

1177
01:05:33,439 --> 01:05:37,791
He's calling for the assassination of the person who's leaving Donuts in the office

1178
01:05:38,815 --> 01:05:42,911
Know you appreciate

1179
01:05:43,935 --> 01:05:45,215
No

1180
01:05:45,727 --> 01:05:46,495
Trace thought

1181
01:05:47,775 --> 01:05:48,799
If you agree with my assessment

1182
01:05:49,055 --> 01:05:49,823
That he

1183
01:05:50,335 --> 01:05:51,103
Is sort of

1184
01:05:51,359 --> 01:05:52,383
Telling his audience

1185
01:05:52,895 --> 01:05:54,431
That God will reward them

1186
01:05:54,687 --> 01:05:57,247
Anderson

1187
01:05:59,039 --> 01:06:00,319
Feels like it

1188
01:06:00,831 --> 01:06:02,367
Ambiano grass Mill

1189
01:06:03,391 --> 01:06:04,671
The children are

1190
01:06:06,975 --> 01:06:09,535
That's why these demons come after our children

1191
01:06:09,791 --> 01:06:12,095
Girl just pray against Anderson Cooper

1192
01:06:13,119 --> 01:06:15,167
Play against the enemy

1193
01:06:16,191 --> 01:06:19,007
God will break them out of vengeance

1194
01:06:19,263 --> 01:06:20,287
Milam's

1195
01:06:21,311 --> 01:06:22,079
God

1196
01:06:25,151 --> 01:06:26,687
Communications are

1197
01:06:27,199 --> 01:06:32,319
The dagger which.

1198
01:06:33,855 --> 01:06:37,183
Vengeance is mine saith the Lord

1199
01:06:39,487 --> 01:06:42,303
God

1200
01:06:42,815 --> 01:06:44,095
Doesn't use vehicles

1201
01:06:44,863 --> 01:06:51,007
Is there a loan debt

1202
01:06:51,263 --> 01:06:55,871
Because your God vehicle you're probably

1203
01:06:56,127 --> 01:07:00,223
Enacting God's will because

1204
01:07:00,479 --> 01:07:05,855
So I mean metaphorical daggers

1205
01:07:06,111 --> 01:07:08,927
God

1206
01:07:11,487 --> 01:07:13,535
God is a god of free will

1207
01:07:17,119 --> 01:07:19,935
God doesn't give you jobs you can complete

1208
01:07:23,775 --> 01:07:24,799
I might do everyday

1209
01:07:25,311 --> 01:07:26,335
Dollar Shave

1210
01:07:28,895 --> 01:07:31,199
How much you can handle let's put this much weight on you

1211
01:07:34,527 --> 01:07:39,647
Jesus said that Don and Aunt

1212
01:07:39,903 --> 01:07:41,439
Piles on

1213
01:07:44,767 --> 01:07:46,047
High pressure

1214
01:07:48,607 --> 01:07:52,191
So he's keep challenging

1215
01:07:52,447 --> 01:07:52,959
To the

1216
01:07:53,215 --> 01:07:55,775
Challenges that are put in front of you by God

1217
01:07:57,055 --> 01:07:59,103
Now you're at urinated a free-will cuz

1218
01:07:59,359 --> 01:08:00,639
Is Godzilla freeway

1219
01:08:00,895 --> 01:08:01,919
So if you

1220
01:08:02,175 --> 01:08:02,687
Become

1221
01:08:03,199 --> 01:08:04,735
Reagents of Gods

1222
01:08:05,759 --> 01:08:06,271
Vengeance

1223
01:08:06,783 --> 01:08:07,295
Because he needs it

1224
01:08:08,063 --> 01:08:10,879
If you do become that you must do it by free will

1225
01:08:11,135 --> 01:08:12,415
And God won't give you a time

1226
01:08:13,951 --> 01:08:17,791
So you do little things can work your way up to killing someone for God

1227
01:08:18,047 --> 01:08:22,399
Outside of the part before it that part about God not

1228
01:08:22,911 --> 01:08:23,935
Rising difficult

1229
01:08:24,191 --> 01:08:29,567
The task comes after his

1230
01:08:30,335 --> 01:08:33,919
Vengeance is God's vehicle for God's

1231
01:08:38,015 --> 01:08:39,039
Like

1232
01:08:39,807 --> 01:08:41,087
I can't say strongly enough

1233
01:08:41,343 --> 01:08:41,855
Key

1234
01:08:42,367 --> 01:08:48,511
Without gokil Anderson Cooper is heavily implying that someone should

1235
01:08:48,767 --> 01:08:50,815
Jesus's parable of the talents

1236
01:08:51,071 --> 01:08:52,607
Was not about becoming

1237
01:08:52,863 --> 01:08:57,727
God's instrument of murder is just about like stewardship incompetence

1238
01:08:57,983 --> 01:08:58,495
Your part

1239
01:08:58,751 --> 01:09:03,359
It's alright

1240
01:09:03,615 --> 01:09:07,967
Also he did it with his Alex did it like he was a drug dealers like

1241
01:09:08,223 --> 01:09:14,367
That'll give you some weight and if you can move pretty good maybe he'll give you a little bit more work that's all I'm saying

1242
01:09:14,623 --> 01:09:17,695
Keep raising your profile

1243
01:09:17,951 --> 01:09:19,999
He was using wait in that

1244
01:09:20,255 --> 01:09:24,863
To be like

1245
01:09:25,375 --> 01:09:26,399
So this goes on

1246
01:09:27,935 --> 01:09:28,447
Fred

1247
01:09:28,703 --> 01:09:29,727
Really starts

1248
01:09:29,983 --> 01:09:32,799
To be unclear what metaphors

1249
01:09:33,823 --> 01:09:34,847
I think that there is a

1250
01:09:35,103 --> 01:09:36,895
Piece where he realize like I've gone

1251
01:09:37,407 --> 01:09:37,919
Too far down

1252
01:09:38,175 --> 01:09:44,319
This particular path

1253
01:09:44,575 --> 01:09:46,111
Because the spirits feeling pretty good

1254
01:09:47,647 --> 01:09:48,159
On this

1255
01:09:48,415 --> 01:09:52,767
Tip I'll take a left onto maybe harm Anderson Cooper Plaza

1256
01:09:53,023 --> 01:09:54,303
I got to control myself

1257
01:09:54,559 --> 01:09:55,583
Let's see if I can

1258
01:09:55,839 --> 01:09:57,119
Figure out a way to do it

1259
01:09:57,631 --> 01:09:58,911
I don't think he sticks The Landing

1260
01:09:59,167 --> 01:10:00,447
Does it stops making sense

1261
01:10:00,703 --> 01:10:01,215
Really fast

1262
01:10:06,079 --> 01:10:08,895
You ever try to go back to the surface

1263
01:10:09,151 --> 01:10:11,199
You no longer a person of that

1264
01:10:11,711 --> 01:10:12,991
I think he's talking about the bends

1265
01:10:19,647 --> 01:10:20,927
Come back from where you are

1266
01:10:21,695 --> 01:10:26,047
Metaphor that he can jump off

1267
01:10:31,935 --> 01:10:32,703
You know

1268
01:10:32,959 --> 01:10:36,287
Go down so deep you can't come back to the surface without being change

1269
01:10:38,335 --> 01:10:40,383
Contextualize it is looking into the abyss

1270
01:10:41,663 --> 01:10:43,711
Is the metaphor for looking at evil

1271
01:10:44,223 --> 01:10:50,367
You look at the abyss of the Abyss looks back at you

1272
01:10:50,623 --> 01:10:52,927
Beautified by God's divine

1273
01:10:53,183 --> 01:10:59,327
You are corrupted

1274
01:10:59,583 --> 01:11:05,727
Directly

1275
01:11:09,055 --> 01:11:11,359
I can respond that all right this is where I'm going to go

1276
01:11:11,615 --> 01:11:12,127
I'm going to take a left

1277
01:11:13,919 --> 01:11:16,991
When you stare into them as a conscious being

1278
01:11:18,271 --> 01:11:20,319
You don't become Fallen like these.

1279
01:11:20,575 --> 01:11:21,855
Like

1280
01:11:22,111 --> 01:11:24,159
Otamatone like these Avatar

1281
01:11:24,415 --> 01:11:25,439
Clutch bags

1282
01:11:26,463 --> 01:11:27,743
What happened to the NPC meme

1283
01:11:34,399 --> 01:11:35,423
The richest man on earth

1284
01:11:36,959 --> 01:11:37,471
He's not there

1285
01:11:39,263 --> 01:11:41,055
Ever come back

1286
01:11:43,615 --> 01:11:46,431
That's something you need to know ladies and gentlemen

1287
01:11:46,943 --> 01:11:48,735
Don't ever come back

1288
01:11:49,247 --> 01:11:50,783
What about the time

1289
01:11:51,807 --> 01:11:55,391
From hell

1290
01:11:57,695 --> 01:11:58,719
Do you really want

1291
01:11:59,231 --> 01:12:00,255
Cross that line

1292
01:12:02,303 --> 01:12:03,327
Do you want to take a life

1293
01:12:03,839 --> 01:12:08,703
What the f*** drunk f*** I think

1294
01:12:13,311 --> 01:12:15,359
Every good thing in this case

1295
01:12:21,503 --> 01:12:23,039
I like that song

1296
01:12:23,295 --> 01:12:26,623
S*** there's a murder lyrics

1297
01:12:26,879 --> 01:12:30,463
It's unfortunate but it is reinforcing what he said earlier

1298
01:12:31,743 --> 01:12:32,255
Disturbing

1299
01:12:37,119 --> 01:12:38,911
You don't need to fear he who can

1300
01:12:48,639 --> 01:12:49,407
Remember

1301
01:12:50,943 --> 01:12:53,247
If you want some intergalactic

1302
01:12:53,503 --> 01:12:55,295
Space junk trash

1303
01:12:56,063 --> 01:12:58,111
If you want to be innocent

1304
01:12:58,367 --> 01:12:59,903
What like the Millennium Falcon

1305
01:13:02,975 --> 01:13:04,255
You can join the Dark Side

1306
01:13:06,815 --> 01:13:08,607
But if you want the keys to Eternity

1307
01:13:10,399 --> 01:13:13,727
Keys to things that the eye has not seen ears on Earth

1308
01:13:13,983 --> 01:13:15,775
You must reject the devil

1309
01:13:18,079 --> 01:13:19,103
Champs

1310
01:13:19,359 --> 01:13:20,383
How old is pops

1311
01:13:20,895 --> 01:13:22,175
Enforcers

1312
01:13:24,479 --> 01:13:24,991
Pops

1313
01:13:25,503 --> 01:13:27,295
Does it mean

1314
01:13:30,879 --> 01:13:31,391
That

1315
01:13:31,903 --> 01:13:33,183
Can I feel you are

1316
01:13:38,559 --> 01:13:41,631
God will show you who you are

1317
01:13:43,167 --> 01:13:45,471
Until you cross those bridges

1318
01:13:45,727 --> 01:13:47,775
Until you face those demons

1319
01:13:48,543 --> 01:13:51,615
You're never going to have got up on the gates up for you

1320
01:13:52,639 --> 01:13:54,943
I want you seen into heaven

1321
01:13:55,711 --> 01:13:58,271
You'll never know why people didn't join God

1322
01:13:58,527 --> 01:13:59,807
It's extremely painful

1323
01:14:00,575 --> 01:14:03,647
I'll tell you you will feel very pathetic and weak

1324
01:14:03,903 --> 01:14:04,671
Forgot

1325
01:14:04,927 --> 01:14:08,767
He will feel unending power and understanding at

1326
01:14:09,279 --> 01:14:10,559
Explosive

1327
01:14:11,071 --> 01:14:11,583
Will

1328
01:14:14,143 --> 01:14:17,471
But you yourself in God's presence will feel

1329
01:14:17,727 --> 01:14:22,335
Incredible God has

1330
01:14:22,591 --> 01:14:23,871
Unlimited

1331
01:14:25,407 --> 01:14:27,199
Cool school

1332
01:14:28,735 --> 01:14:32,319
Once you're in the presence of God like a relation

1333
01:14:32,831 --> 01:14:34,367
The Saints take the crowns off

1334
01:14:39,743 --> 01:14:41,023
God consciousness

1335
01:14:41,279 --> 01:14:43,071
Universe is so big

1336
01:14:44,863 --> 01:14:49,471
He was faking crying there or maybe because you didn't have time for a nap

1337
01:14:51,007 --> 01:14:57,151
Call me when you can

1338
01:14:58,431 --> 01:14:59,455
There was a

1339
01:14:59,711 --> 01:15:05,343
I got to find a way to jump how I have been in the presence of God

1340
01:15:05,599 --> 01:15:07,903
And a king's throat out

1341
01:15:08,159 --> 01:15:13,535
The orchestra's like Merrell we get one more than one Oscar

1342
01:15:13,791 --> 01:15:16,095
Speech in a fuk

1343
01:15:18,655 --> 01:15:21,983
I mean the part about it where it's very

1344
01:15:22,239 --> 01:15:22,751
Clearly

1345
01:15:25,055 --> 01:15:30,431
Inspirational part alone is

1346
01:15:30,687 --> 01:15:32,479
Like you cannot do stuff like that

1347
01:15:33,247 --> 01:15:34,015
Then it's

1348
01:15:34,783 --> 01:15:35,295
Do this but

1349
01:15:35,551 --> 01:15:37,855
Spirituality that he is

1350
01:15:38,111 --> 01:15:38,623
He's present

1351
01:15:39,135 --> 01:15:39,647
Where

1352
01:15:40,671 --> 01:15:41,439
Spirituality

1353
01:15:41,695 --> 01:15:45,023
Ethan service of reinforcing his wish to

1354
01:15:45,279 --> 01:15:46,559
Anderson Cooper

1355
01:15:46,815 --> 01:15:49,887
He says that God won't open up the gates of Heaven for you

1356
01:15:50,143 --> 01:15:51,935
Unless you face his demons

1357
01:15:53,471 --> 01:15:54,751
Who redeems you talk about

1358
01:15:55,007 --> 01:15:56,799
People like that

1359
01:15:57,311 --> 01:16:00,383
He says that God won't give you more weight than you can handle

1360
01:16:00,895 --> 01:16:02,687
Keep giving you harder stuff

1361
01:16:02,943 --> 01:16:05,247
Well what's f****** harder than killing

1362
01:16:06,015 --> 01:16:09,087
Did everything is in service

1363
01:16:09,343 --> 01:16:10,367
Without waking

1364
01:16:10,623 --> 01:16:12,415
Perceived as the legal consequences

1365
01:16:12,671 --> 01:16:13,951
Of have just saying like

1366
01:16:14,207 --> 01:16:15,487
F****** take that guy out

1367
01:16:15,743 --> 01:16:16,255
Bright

1368
01:16:17,535 --> 01:16:18,047
I just had

1369
01:16:19,583 --> 01:16:20,095
Interesting

1370
01:16:21,119 --> 01:16:22,655
We ever stopped

1371
01:16:22,911 --> 01:16:23,423
Considered

1372
01:16:23,679 --> 01:16:24,959
That maybe Alex

1373
01:16:25,471 --> 01:16:26,495
Still worship

1374
01:16:26,751 --> 01:16:27,263
The devil

1375
01:16:28,287 --> 01:16:29,055
Because think about

1376
01:16:29,311 --> 01:16:31,359
AR Rahman

1377
01:16:31,615 --> 01:16:32,127
Almost

1378
01:16:32,383 --> 01:16:36,479
Exactly the same way

1379
01:16:36,735 --> 01:16:38,015
It describes the devil

1380
01:16:38,783 --> 01:16:41,599
Like it is everything like even though even though

1381
01:16:41,855 --> 01:16:44,671
Okay little bit

1382
01:16:45,183 --> 01:16:47,743
Then he gives you more doesn't that sound more like temp

1383
01:16:47,999 --> 01:16:54,143
It's not sounding more like Temptation breaking down or is it also

1384
01:16:54,399 --> 01:16:56,447
Sarah Powell

1385
01:16:56,703 --> 01:17:02,847
Wait that never ceases to increased punishment

1386
01:17:03,103 --> 01:17:06,431
Punishment

1387
01:17:06,687 --> 01:17:12,831
Control over demon worshippers and Demon followers do you know who else has control

1388
01:17:13,087 --> 01:17:13,855
He said that

1389
01:17:14,111 --> 01:17:20,255
He said you have complete power over a

1390
01:17:22,559 --> 01:17:26,911
Who is sounds more likely to tell you to kill somebody

1391
01:17:27,423 --> 01:17:29,215
Then the devil

1392
01:17:30,239 --> 01:17:30,751
So

1393
01:17:31,263 --> 01:17:35,359
I'm starting to get a clearer picture that

1394
01:17:40,479 --> 01:17:41,247
Siri

1395
01:17:47,903 --> 01:17:50,975
You know what that's the other thing that's really interesting is the

1396
01:17:51,999 --> 01:17:57,887
Booty and the experiential conversation about the killing of a dog breeds

1397
01:18:03,263 --> 01:18:08,127
That you talked about that like it's happened before

1398
01:18:08,383 --> 01:18:10,687
Presence of literal God

1399
01:18:10,943 --> 01:18:15,295
Too many normal people

1400
01:18:15,807 --> 01:18:19,391
The devil Satan right it's been awhile since

1401
01:18:19,647 --> 01:18:22,975
We've really heard a nod batshit person

1402
01:18:24,255 --> 01:18:25,535
Say that he's been in the Press

1403
01:18:25,791 --> 01:18:26,559
God

1404
01:18:27,839 --> 01:18:32,191
I don't know I mean like just alone very terrifying

1405
01:18:32,447 --> 01:18:32,959
Religious

1406
01:18:33,215 --> 01:18:33,727
Overtone

1407
01:18:33,983 --> 01:18:34,751
Story saying

1408
01:18:35,007 --> 01:18:36,031
Makes me think like

1409
01:18:36,543 --> 01:18:37,055
He needs

1410
01:18:37,311 --> 01:18:38,591
To get some serious help

1411
01:18:38,847 --> 01:18:39,615
And that this

1412
01:18:39,871 --> 01:18:43,711
Because it's all applied in service is something that I really think is illegal

1413
01:18:44,223 --> 01:18:46,527
I think it was super is

1414
01:18:47,039 --> 01:18:49,599
It is inspirational terrorism

1415
01:18:49,855 --> 01:18:52,927
Dd-do wish to hide behind your words

1416
01:18:53,183 --> 01:18:56,511
While you inspire people to commit terrorist Act

1417
01:18:56,767 --> 01:19:00,095
Like it is Onix it's unacceptable on

1418
01:19:01,119 --> 01:19:02,143
I very much

1419
01:19:02,399 --> 01:19:06,751
Pray I do pray but I really hope

1420
01:19:09,055 --> 01:19:09,567
Weeks

1421
01:19:24,671 --> 01:19:30,815
It makes me believe that there is a secret ongoing battle between Heaven and Hell

1422
01:19:31,071 --> 01:19:31,583
Alex

1423
01:19:31,839 --> 01:19:33,887
Has been corrupted

1424
01:19:34,655 --> 01:19:36,959
And that we need to start taking Satan really seriously

1425
01:19:37,471 --> 01:19:38,751
That's it

1426
01:19:39,007 --> 01:19:41,823
Way to look at it

1427
01:19:42,335 --> 01:19:44,383
Yeah we should do I don't know

1428
01:19:45,663 --> 01:19:50,527
Write a novella

1429
01:19:51,039 --> 01:19:54,367
I think it's the best we can do return from war music

1430
01:19:54,623 --> 01:19:56,927
Call the feds

1431
01:19:57,183 --> 01:19:57,695
But

1432
01:19:57,951 --> 01:19:59,487
And nobody listens to us anyway

1433
01:20:00,511 --> 01:20:03,071
So pissed off

1434
01:20:04,351 --> 01:20:09,215
Is plug-in Fair after heated riled up the audience

1435
01:20:10,751 --> 01:20:12,031
Evoke feelings

1436
01:20:12,287 --> 01:20:12,799
Some people

1437
01:20:13,055 --> 01:20:15,104
And

1438
01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:16,384
Commercial for the

1439
01:20:16,896 --> 01:20:17,664

New sale

1443
01:20:24,576 --> 01:20:25,344
The forced sale

1444
01:20:25,856 --> 01:20:29,440
The force

1445
01:20:29,952 --> 01:20:34,560
You got the 8-pack powerstack

1446
01:20:35,072 --> 01:20:36,608
Commercial goes

1447
01:20:36,864 --> 01:20:37,632
The f****** rails

1448
01:20:38,144 --> 01:20:39,936
Real Fair

1449
01:20:40,192 --> 01:20:43,008
Headspace

1450
01:20:44,288 --> 01:20:44,800
Commercial breaks

1451
01:20:46,848 --> 01:20:47,616
Kenny gets into this

1452
01:20:48,896 --> 01:20:49,664
It's the best

1453
01:20:50,432 --> 01:20:51,712
These products are the best

1454
01:20:52,224 --> 01:20:52,736
Like yours

1455
01:20:52,992 --> 01:20:53,760
I got eight things

1456
01:20:54,016 --> 01:20:56,064
Here and there

1457
01:20:56,832 --> 01:20:57,856
I'm going to get really mad

1458
01:20:58,112 --> 01:20:59,392
And it goes so far apart and rails

1459
01:21:00,928 --> 01:21:07,072
Physically

1460
01:21:07,328 --> 01:21:07,840
Turn off

1461
01:21:21,152 --> 01:21:22,944
I'm a God-fearing person listen to him

1462
01:21:25,504 --> 01:21:26,016
Creepy

1463
01:21:26,784 --> 01:21:28,320
So it's the best or you can

1464
01:21:28,576 --> 01:21:29,600
Impala headlights

1465
01:21:33,440 --> 01:21:34,464
The gentleman doth protest

1466
01:21:34,720 --> 01:21:36,768
Too much

1467
01:21:40,096 --> 01:21:43,424
This is the best car you've ever driven or you can blow my head off

1468
01:21:43,680 --> 01:21:47,264
Do the letters

1469
01:21:47,520 --> 01:21:49,056
I've always wanted an RV

1470
01:21:49,312 --> 01:21:50,848
But I really would love to live in an RV

1471
01:21:51,360 --> 01:21:52,640
Yeah it's some point in my life

1472
01:21:52,896 --> 01:21:54,176
I would love to do that

1473
01:21:54,432 --> 01:21:56,224
If I went to an RV dealer

1474
01:21:56,480 --> 01:21:58,528
And it was a reasonably priced

1475
01:21:58,784 --> 01:21:59,808
In my wheelhouse

1476
01:22:00,320 --> 01:22:06,464
Good-looking RV deal

1477
01:22:07,744 --> 01:22:09,280
Do you saying that means

1478
01:22:10,304 --> 01:22:16,448
First of all it becomes

1479
01:22:16,960 --> 01:22:23,104
Because I know at least I can trust them not to blow their own haiwan a Salesman who's almost disinterested

1480
01:22:31,296 --> 01:22:37,184
Not somebody I don't want to salesman who is putting their life on the line for a sailor

1481
01:22:38,208 --> 01:22:44,352
Scrubs

1482
01:22:51,008 --> 01:22:54,080
We need to bring for Saline

1483
01:22:57,152 --> 01:23:01,504
So in this next clip its continuation of that ad going off the rails

1484
01:23:02,784 --> 01:23:03,296
It's like

1485
01:23:03,552 --> 01:23:04,064
That this is

1486
01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:13,024
No engagement

1487
01:23:16,352 --> 01:23:17,888
Why because I'm some

1488
01:23:20,192 --> 01:23:20,960
Metaphysically

1489
01:23:21,472 --> 01:23:23,008
Don't even think like that

1490
01:23:25,312 --> 01:23:27,104
Screwing over people that count on me

1491
01:23:31,712 --> 01:23:36,832
Bonecrusher really scared I got really alone

1492
01:23:53,216 --> 01:23:56,032
Sounds like there's a but coming though right

1493
01:24:07,040 --> 01:24:10,112
He's not special folks

1494
01:24:10,624 --> 01:24:13,440
When you live in a world of crazy people

1495
01:24:18,560 --> 01:24:19,840
Should I take a call

1496
01:24:20,096 --> 01:24:23,168
Ataxic

1497
01:24:32,896 --> 01:24:35,200
We can't screw you over but I

1498
01:24:35,712 --> 01:24:36,224
Make a text

1499
01:24:38,528 --> 01:24:42,368
It's really hard to tell how much of that is pretty performativity how much of it is like

1500
01:24:42,880 --> 01:24:43,392
Him

1501
01:24:43,648 --> 01:24:45,184
Representing something he does

1502
01:24:45,440 --> 01:24:45,952
Struggle with

1503
01:24:46,464 --> 01:24:49,536
It's very hard

1504
01:24:49,792 --> 01:24:55,936
It doesn't seem like he's almost describing how you would feel if you knowingly

1505
01:24:56,192 --> 01:24:59,264
Get to people like every conscious describe

1506
01:24:59,520 --> 01:25:02,336
Is exactly how you would feel you would stay up at night being like

1507
01:25:03,104 --> 01:25:06,944
Pink I hope nobody catches me because I'm a f****** fraud this whole thing is

1508
01:25:08,992 --> 01:25:09,760
And I'm never

1509
01:25:10,528 --> 01:25:11,040
Even though that

1510
01:25:12,576 --> 01:25:16,672
Unless your Bone Crusher Never Scared

1511
01:25:16,928 --> 01:25:18,208
Do you know what he is

1512
01:25:18,464 --> 01:25:20,000
Yeah

1513
01:25:21,536 --> 01:25:22,304
If you thought

1514
01:25:22,560 --> 01:25:27,936
We heard earlier where Alex was murdered

1515
01:25:28,192 --> 01:25:31,264
Was the only time episode

1516
01:25:31,520 --> 01:25:32,288
Suggest

1517
01:25:33,312 --> 01:25:35,872
Kill somebody that he doesn't like

1518
01:25:36,384 --> 01:25:39,456
Cuz he starts talking about the governor of Virginia Ralph Northam

1519
01:25:39,712 --> 01:25:40,992
And listen to this

1520
01:25:41,504 --> 01:25:43,040
Almost even borek

1521
01:25:44,064 --> 01:25:45,088
Should I take a call

1522
01:25:46,368 --> 01:25:51,488
That's just a illustrate that this is a continuous thing from that freak out in the last clip

1523
01:25:58,144 --> 01:26:01,984
Metaphysically he can't screw on over

1524
01:26:02,752 --> 01:26:05,312
I'll take your calls

1525
01:26:05,824 --> 01:26:06,848
Should I take it off

1526
01:26:18,624 --> 01:26:21,696
Got to go through this

1527
01:26:22,720 --> 01:26:25,280
Harmonist Governor Northam

1528
01:26:25,536 --> 01:26:26,560
Sounds like there's a but coming

1529
01:26:32,448 --> 01:26:33,984
Clean off

1530
01:26:35,520 --> 01:26:38,336
It was supposed to promote

1531
01:26:40,384 --> 01:26:43,200
Samurai sword

1532
01:26:45,248 --> 01:26:46,528
Maybe

1533
01:26:54,208 --> 01:26:55,232
House

1534
01:26:55,488 --> 01:27:01,376
Underwear the medical injection

1535
01:27:01,632 --> 01:27:06,496
Cuz you kept them comfortable

1536
01:27:09,824 --> 01:27:12,640
Could you say you going to kill the baby

1537
01:27:19,040 --> 01:27:21,600
You have value Northam

1538
01:27:35,168 --> 01:27:36,704
Do you think he really

1539
01:27:37,216 --> 01:27:43,360
But drop the ball with high-and-mighty person at the end was trying to come up with a better noun

1540
01:27:44,384 --> 01:27:44,896
Style font

1541
01:27:45,664 --> 01:27:48,224
I think I'm offended on behalf of the Georgia Act

1542
01:27:48,736 --> 01:27:51,040
I apologize to everybody with the Georgia Acts

1543
01:27:51,296 --> 01:27:52,320
I got to say

1544
01:27:52,576 --> 01:27:53,088
Alex

1545
01:27:53,344 --> 01:27:53,856
Disagrees

1546
01:27:54,112 --> 01:27:57,696
Impression

1547
01:27:57,952 --> 01:28:03,072
So it's really bad

1548
01:28:05,888 --> 01:28:11,264
I know from listening to hours of the show that doesn't necessarily get represented on the show

1549
01:28:11,520 --> 01:28:17,152
I'm telling you about is how much he does that

1550
01:28:17,408 --> 01:28:23,552
That's really bad really feel like that

1551
01:28:23,808 --> 01:28:24,832
Actually rake braces

1552
01:28:25,088 --> 01:28:27,904
It has nothing to do with George

1553
01:28:29,696 --> 01:28:35,840
Borderline Song of the South exit

1554
01:28:36,864 --> 01:28:39,424
His intention I think he's

1555
01:28:39,680 --> 01:28:44,288
I think he's almost just doing like an impression of somebody else's impression of a racist

1556
01:28:45,056 --> 01:28:51,200
Voice

1557
01:28:51,712 --> 01:28:52,736
Veterans Georgia

1558
01:28:53,760 --> 01:28:54,272
It's not

1559
01:28:54,528 --> 01:28:56,064
Incredibly Close to Northam

1560
01:28:56,576 --> 01:29:02,464
I wouldn't be able to pick it out if I didn't constantly let's do a show at know that

1561
01:29:02,720 --> 01:29:03,744
Congratulations Alex

1562
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:08,352
I wonder if someone chopped his head off it would be

1563
01:29:10,656 --> 01:29:11,680
No it's not

1564
01:29:11,936 --> 01:29:14,752
But at the same time not

1565
01:29:15,008 --> 01:29:18,336
What can he said I would be like

1566
01:29:18,592 --> 01:29:20,640
Don't don't f****** do something like that

1567
01:29:24,736 --> 01:29:25,760
I think that's illegal

1568
01:29:26,016 --> 01:29:30,624
I don't I don't know if it's not we need to change the laws because

1569
01:29:31,136 --> 01:29:33,440
That is exactly how you get people

1570
01:29:33,952 --> 01:29:34,464
Crime

1571
01:29:34,720 --> 01:29:36,512
Yeah

1572
01:29:36,768 --> 01:29:39,328
He's hiding his hypothetical

1573
01:29:39,584 --> 01:29:40,608
Behind the samurai

1574
01:29:41,376 --> 01:29:45,216
Like that does all the heavy lifting on that

1575
01:29:45,472 --> 01:29:45,984
North

1576
01:29:46,240 --> 01:29:47,776
Cuz I'm making a joke about Samurai

1577
01:29:48,288 --> 01:29:51,616
Misrepresentation of abortion

1578
01:29:51,872 --> 01:29:54,944
Comparative

1579
01:29:55,200 --> 01:29:59,040
Advocating for his murder and

1580
01:29:59,296 --> 01:30:05,440
Behind battle little bit straight outside

1581
01:30:05,696 --> 01:30:06,208
I hope it gets

1582
01:30:06,464 --> 01:30:08,256
Murdered

1583
01:30:08,512 --> 01:30:11,328
It's still worth pointing out I believe

1584
01:30:11,584 --> 01:30:12,096
That

1585
01:30:13,120 --> 01:30:14,656
Binnewies exist on the same page

1586
01:30:16,192 --> 01:30:18,240
It seems like he's in a murder headspace

1587
01:30:18,496 --> 01:30:20,544
For sure

1588
01:30:28,992 --> 01:30:30,784
Pier on the 4th

1589
01:30:31,040 --> 01:30:32,576
And it's more talkin about North

1590
01:30:33,344 --> 01:30:34,112
And

1591
01:30:34,368 --> 01:30:35,904
You saying that like North

1592
01:30:44,608 --> 01:30:47,168
Well let me tell you nor them you already going to figure it out

1593
01:30:48,192 --> 01:30:53,824
You'd be lucky if somebody chopped your head off with Samurai sword brother that ain't answering

1594
01:30:55,104 --> 01:30:58,176
You know I live a long life and when you sit there on that Deathbed

1595
01:30:58,432 --> 01:31:00,480
They're going to be demon sitting all around you

1596
01:31:00,992 --> 01:31:02,784
I'm sitting right in your bed

1597
01:31:03,552 --> 01:31:06,112
It's going to be rubbing his hands together and saying

1598
01:31:06,624 --> 01:31:07,136
Buddy

1599
01:31:09,184 --> 01:31:12,512
Before you know it I'm going to be attached to you forever

1600
01:31:12,768 --> 01:31:15,072
Shocking your eyeballs out

1601
01:31:15,840 --> 01:31:18,400
Everett

1602
01:31:18,656 --> 01:31:20,192
Average

1603
01:31:20,448 --> 01:31:21,984
So sweet

1604
01:31:28,128 --> 01:31:32,480
See that little friendly fella sitting down there

1605
01:31:39,136 --> 01:31:45,280
Alright

1606
01:31:45,536 --> 01:31:47,072
Northam on that gesture

1607
01:31:47,584 --> 01:31:51,680
He has a lot of inside he does

1608
01:31:52,960 --> 01:31:53,472
That means all made up

1609
01:31:53,728 --> 01:31:56,288
Another check mark

1610
01:31:56,544 --> 01:31:59,360
I walk away from a clip like that is

1611
01:32:00,384 --> 01:32:01,408
How much does he think

1612
01:32:01,920 --> 01:32:02,432
He's being fun

1613
01:32:03,456 --> 01:32:05,760
You know that's a good question

1614
01:32:06,272 --> 01:32:07,040
It's tough

1615
01:32:07,552 --> 01:32:08,320
To tell

1616
01:32:08,576 --> 01:32:10,880
Cuz the excellent kind of implies that he thinks

1617
01:32:11,392 --> 01:32:11,904
Funny

1618
01:32:12,160 --> 01:32:13,440
Ice I wonder

1619
01:32:13,696 --> 01:32:14,976
Right under

1620
01:32:15,488 --> 01:32:16,768
Yeah.

1621
01:32:20,096 --> 01:32:21,120
He's making points

1622
01:32:23,680 --> 01:32:29,824
And there's not a satire aspect

1623
01:32:31,360 --> 01:32:32,384
There is it

1624
01:32:32,640 --> 01:32:36,480
Political

1625
01:32:36,736 --> 01:32:37,760
There is just

1626
01:32:40,064 --> 01:32:40,832
Possibly

1627
01:32:42,112 --> 01:32:42,624
Humor

1628
01:32:42,880 --> 01:32:44,672
Along with his

1629
01:32:45,184 --> 01:32:46,464
Is terrible

1630
01:32:46,720 --> 01:32:47,488
Politico

1631
01:32:47,744 --> 01:32:51,840
Yeah I don't know I don't know I was thinking about that a bit when I was listening

1632
01:32:54,144 --> 01:32:55,936
How much should we be criticizing

1633
01:32:56,192 --> 01:32:56,704
For his failed

1634
01:32:57,216 --> 01:33:01,312
Huber cuz it doesn't really doesn't sound like

1635
01:33:01,568 --> 01:33:06,432
He's trying to be funny but I could see him making the argument that I would try all right

1636
01:33:06,688 --> 01:33:10,528
It reminds me

1637
01:33:11,296 --> 01:33:15,648
Like the the way it sounds and if he is expecting love

1638
01:33:16,160 --> 01:33:19,232
It reminds me so much of the same guy at an open-mic

1639
01:33:19,488 --> 01:33:21,280
Who is like I am so funny

1640
01:33:21,536 --> 01:33:27,680
It's terrible at 9

1641
01:33:27,936 --> 01:33:30,496
Like I'm doing comedy

1642
01:33:30,752 --> 01:33:32,288
Yes

1643
01:33:32,544 --> 01:33:33,568
Being a f****** dick

1644
01:33:34,080 --> 01:33:37,664
But it's, and say what I believe in has Silly voice

1645
01:33:37,920 --> 01:33:39,712
Right

1646
01:33:39,968 --> 01:33:40,992
I wonder about that

1647
01:33:41,248 --> 01:33:44,576
Jump off here on the 4th to the 5th

1648
01:33:44,832 --> 01:33:48,416
Alex's had a little bit of a jarring experience on the way

1649
01:33:48,672 --> 01:33:49,184
Studio

1650
01:33:49,696 --> 01:33:51,232
That is easy

1651
01:33:53,024 --> 01:33:53,792
I guess you

1652
01:33:58,656 --> 01:34:03,520
Here today

1653
01:34:04,032 --> 01:34:06,336
Is the last two DHHS pads

1654
01:34:06,848 --> 01:34:07,616
Crash

1655
01:34:15,808 --> 01:34:19,904
That their cities are collapsing into medieval squalor

1656
01:34:20,928 --> 01:34:23,488
And then it's only getting worse in something

1657
01:34:23,744 --> 01:34:24,768
Publix

1658
01:34:29,120 --> 01:34:31,936
Well just on my way into the office this morning

1659
01:34:32,704 --> 01:34:33,984
I dodged

1660
01:34:36,800 --> 01:34:37,568
3 *

1661
01:34:44,480 --> 01:34:44,992
We know

1662
01:34:46,016 --> 01:34:46,528
We've been

1663
01:34:48,320 --> 01:34:51,648
On the scene

1664
01:34:52,160 --> 01:34:54,464
With men that look like

1665
01:34:54,720 --> 01:34:55,488
Zombies

1666
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:57,024
Webstaurant

1667
01:34:59,328 --> 01:35:00,864
DC streaming

1668
01:35:03,168 --> 01:35:04,448
Almost causing a car wreck

1669
01:35:08,032 --> 01:35:09,824
Then I get up

1670
01:35:11,360 --> 01:35:12,640
Run into something similar

1671
01:35:13,408 --> 01:35:14,688
Close the office

1672
01:35:15,200 --> 01:35:17,248
Stumbling out in traffic

1673
01:35:17,504 --> 01:35:18,272
Wild-eyed

1674
01:35:19,552 --> 01:35:21,856
This is a manifestation of the truly

1675
01:35:22,624 --> 01:35:25,952
And the drugs and the alcohol in the opioids

1676
01:35:26,976 --> 01:35:30,560
Just the breakdown of society and it's accelerating

1677
01:35:31,584 --> 01:35:32,864
It's like Day of the Dead out there

1678
01:35:33,888 --> 01:35:34,912
And it's only

1679
01:35:35,936 --> 01:35:36,448
Forget

1680
01:35:36,704 --> 01:35:37,216
Worse

1681
01:35:38,752 --> 01:35:40,032
He says

1682
01:35:40,288 --> 01:35:40,800
Intentional

1683
01:35:41,056 --> 01:35:46,432
Appliance

1684
01:35:46,688 --> 01:35:47,712
Isabella

1685
01:35:47,968 --> 01:35:48,480
Exaggerating

1686
01:35:50,528 --> 01:35:51,040
Morning Drive

1687
01:35:51,808 --> 01:35:52,320
But

1688
01:35:53,600 --> 01:35:55,648
To hear somebody talk that way

1689
01:35:56,160 --> 01:35:57,952
About homeless people

1690
01:35:58,464 --> 01:36:00,000
To be someone like our

1691
01:36:00,256 --> 01:36:01,280
Alex Jones is disgust

1692
01:36:02,048 --> 01:36:04,096
Because if you see these things

1693
01:36:04,352 --> 01:36:05,120
See Witness

1694
01:36:05,376 --> 01:36:06,912
People living in that kind of

1695
01:36:07,168 --> 01:36:07,680
Condition

1696
01:36:07,936 --> 01:36:10,496
And your response to it is what the f****** globalist

1697
01:36:11,008 --> 01:36:13,056
As opposed to like some sort of empathy

1698
01:36:14,336 --> 01:36:15,360
What can we do

1699
01:36:15,616 --> 01:36:16,896
Systemic issues can we address

1700
01:36:17,664 --> 01:36:19,456
Help people not live in

1701
01:36:19,712 --> 01:36:21,504
The circumstance that I'm seeing in front of me

1702
01:36:23,040 --> 01:36:23,808
It's insane

1703
01:36:24,576 --> 01:36:25,088
It's heartless

1704
01:36:26,112 --> 01:36:27,648
Idea of

1705
01:36:28,160 --> 01:36:28,672
What he

1706
01:36:29,696 --> 01:36:30,720
Somebody who is

1707
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:32,768
Paintings for

1708
01:36:33,024 --> 01:36:33,536
Policies

1709
01:36:34,560 --> 01:36:36,864
The number of homeless

1710
01:36:37,376 --> 01:36:38,656
Blaming the homeless

1711
01:36:38,912 --> 01:36:39,424
And

1712
01:36:39,936 --> 01:36:42,240
Vilifying them in calling them disgusting

1713
01:36:42,496 --> 01:36:44,032
In service of

1714
01:36:44,288 --> 01:36:47,104
Supporting policies that will only create more homeless

1715
01:36:47,616 --> 01:36:48,640
It's f******

1716
01:36:48,896 --> 01:36:52,736
Nightmare and make the people who are living in those circumstances

1717
01:36:52,992 --> 01:36:53,760
Does much more

1718
01:36:54,016 --> 01:36:55,040
And they're not even

1719
01:36:55,552 --> 01:36:58,624
Like already be starts with zombies

1720
01:36:58,880 --> 01:37:01,696
Because that's what he sees them at.

1721
01:37:07,840 --> 01:37:08,352
F******

1722
01:37:12,192 --> 01:37:14,240
A lot of homeless people in

1723
01:37:14,496 --> 01:37:15,264
In Chicago

1724
01:37:15,520 --> 01:37:16,032
And

1725
01:37:16,800 --> 01:37:17,312
If

1726
01:37:18,080 --> 01:37:19,360
If somebody I was

1727
01:37:19,616 --> 01:37:21,152
Like if you and I were walking

1728
01:37:23,456 --> 01:37:27,296
You walk past somebody and then turn around and go give them a dollar

1729
01:37:27,552 --> 01:37:31,648
Go out of your way because you realized you had a

1730
01:37:31,904 --> 01:37:32,672
I know that that

1731
01:37:44,704 --> 01:37:46,240
Just turning around and saying like

1732
01:37:46,496 --> 01:37:48,544
Like if we walk past him and somebody's like

1733
01:37:48,800 --> 01:37:49,568
Look at those zombie

1734
01:37:50,080 --> 01:37:51,104
I'd be f******

1735
01:38:00,064 --> 01:38:05,952
It's absolutely absolutely

1736
01:38:06,464 --> 01:38:09,280
I was talking about with the

1737
01:38:09,536 --> 01:38:10,560
Prince in his past self

1738
01:38:10,816 --> 01:38:11,584
What is present is like

1739
01:38:11,840 --> 01:38:12,864
Is punching down

1740
01:38:13,120 --> 01:38:15,168
Yeah it's so much just like

1741
01:38:15,680 --> 01:38:17,472
I don't know how he would have covered homes

1742
01:38:17,728 --> 01:38:18,752
Biking

1743
01:38:19,008 --> 01:38:25,152
95 or 97 government

1744
01:38:25,408 --> 01:38:25,920
Circumstances

1745
01:38:26,176 --> 01:38:28,736
As opposed to

1746
01:38:28,992 --> 01:38:31,040
6:30 still does

1747
01:38:31,296 --> 01:38:36,160
Much more down were punching them as discussed

1748
01:38:37,696 --> 01:38:39,232
Yeah sure the globalist

1749
01:38:39,488 --> 01:38:40,256
Are you trying to

1750
01:38:40,512 --> 01:38:42,048
Create

1751
01:38:42,304 --> 01:38:43,072
Yeah

1752
01:38:43,328 --> 01:38:45,376
Exactly their legs

1753
01:38:45,632 --> 01:38:48,448
It's falling down

1754
01:38:49,216 --> 01:38:49,728
Seth gross

1755
01:38:51,008 --> 01:38:51,520
Also

1756
01:38:52,800 --> 01:38:53,568
Note

1757
01:38:55,104 --> 01:38:56,384
The fact that

1758
01:38:59,200 --> 01:39:00,736
Alex covered that clearly fake

1759
01:39:00,992 --> 01:39:02,784
Blog post about women having orgasm

1760
01:39:03,040 --> 01:39:03,808
I'm going to get divorced

1761
01:39:04,064 --> 01:39:04,576
Yeah

1762
01:39:04,832 --> 01:39:06,368
You would think it's some point

1763
01:39:06,880 --> 01:39:07,648
Maybe while he's on

1764
01:39:10,208 --> 01:39:12,768
Next day Alex

1765
01:39:13,280 --> 01:39:14,560
Stop talking about that

1766
01:39:14,816 --> 01:39:16,096
That was not a real

1767
01:39:16,352 --> 01:39:16,864
Article

1768
01:39:17,120 --> 01:39:21,216
You take it to hit any kind of journalistic Integrity he would have figured out by then

1769
01:39:21,472 --> 01:39:23,520
It was a f****** troll article

1770
01:39:24,800 --> 01:39:25,568
On the 5th

1771
01:39:25,824 --> 01:39:26,336
He comes in

1772
01:39:26,848 --> 01:39:28,384
He starts talking about all the proof

1773
01:39:30,432 --> 01:39:31,200
And what do you know

1774
01:39:31,456 --> 01:39:33,760
That article is referenced his list

1775
01:39:34,784 --> 01:39:37,856
God I hate

1776
01:39:38,624 --> 01:39:40,160
Prepares the next move

1777
01:39:40,416 --> 01:39:42,208
Forced population

1778
01:39:42,720 --> 01:39:43,488
Operation

1779
01:39:44,256 --> 01:39:46,304
Which you'll be

1780
01:39:46,816 --> 01:39:48,096
By the time

1781
01:39:51,168 --> 01:39:52,704
Exist in the context of him talking

1782
01:39:52,960 --> 01:39:54,240
King about

1783
01:39:54,752 --> 01:39:58,336
Population

1784
01:39:58,592 --> 01:40:01,664
It's really an expression of him wishing all these people

1785
01:40:02,176 --> 01:40:03,200
Or dad I guess

1786
01:40:04,480 --> 01:40:05,760
Expression of like

1787
01:40:06,272 --> 01:40:07,296
Let me tell you

1788
01:40:07,552 --> 01:40:08,832
My Drive-In

1789
01:40:09,088 --> 01:40:14,720
It all really start

1790
01:40:15,232 --> 01:40:19,072
Alex Express

1791
01:40:19,328 --> 01:40:20,096
You want oh yeah

1792
01:40:21,376 --> 01:40:22,144
Problem

1793
01:40:22,912 --> 01:40:23,680
Reaction

1794
01:40:24,704 --> 01:40:26,496
Horses

1795
01:40:27,264 --> 01:40:28,800
In places like Japan

1796
01:40:29,568 --> 01:40:31,616
Dance places like Brazil

1797
01:40:31,872 --> 01:40:32,896
And places like

1798
01:40:33,152 --> 01:40:35,456
United States

1799
01:40:35,968 --> 01:40:39,040
The one I get off of the globalist social engineering

1800
01:40:39,296 --> 01:40:41,344
The shine post-industrial

1801
01:40:41,600 --> 01:40:43,392
Posthuman era

1802
01:40:46,464 --> 01:40:50,048
Now you see is Mainline all over TV Oliver radio

1803
01:40:50,304 --> 01:40:52,352
Oliver culture humans

1804
01:40:52,608 --> 01:40:55,680
We should be.

1805
01:40:56,704 --> 01:41:00,032
We should kill babies

1806
01:41:00,288 --> 01:41:02,592
So much fun

1807
01:41:02,848 --> 01:41:03,616
Sexually

1808
01:41:03,872 --> 01:41:04,896
Pleasurable

1809
01:41:05,152 --> 01:41:09,760
Bison

1810
01:41:10,016 --> 01:41:14,880
Open the gate

1811
01:41:18,208 --> 01:41:22,304
What is the clearest at least true

1812
01:41:22,816 --> 01:41:25,120
Do all of his arguments are based on just like

1813
01:41:25,376 --> 01:41:26,912
Lightly polished up piles of

1814
01:41:30,240 --> 01:41:31,520
It's just if you have been

1815
01:41:32,800 --> 01:41:33,312
Then doctor

1816
01:41:37,152 --> 01:41:38,432
I bet somebody did try and

1817
01:41:38,688 --> 01:41:41,504
Call Pancho

1818
01:41:41,760 --> 01:41:47,904
Hey this is a completely satirical article in his likes

1819
01:41:48,160 --> 01:41:52,768
4 threatened by its written by this guy

1820
01:41:56,608 --> 01:41:57,376
Understand

1821
01:41:58,144 --> 01:41:58,656
He's like God

1822
01:42:00,448 --> 01:42:01,728
To get women to have orgasm

1823
01:42:01,984 --> 01:42:05,056
Okay Alex whatever

1824
01:42:05,312 --> 01:42:08,384
That's what we call you tomorrow

1825
01:42:08,640 --> 01:42:12,224
Schizophrenic

1826
01:42:12,480 --> 01:42:16,064
Edward Bernays

1827
01:42:16,576 --> 01:42:20,160
And his work always fun is propaganda work

1828
01:42:20,416 --> 01:42:22,976
Jerome corsi has claimed that he was trained by Edward Bernays

1829
01:42:27,072 --> 01:42:27,584
Maybe that makes

1830
01:42:28,096 --> 01:42:30,144
Jerome corsi

1831
01:42:31,680 --> 01:42:33,728
Still whatever Alex brings up everybody is like he doesn't

1832
01:42:33,984 --> 01:42:34,752
Next clip

1833
01:42:35,008 --> 01:42:39,872
He doesn't say like

1834
01:42:40,128 --> 01:42:42,176
Instead he just revealed

1835
01:42:42,432 --> 01:42:43,456
Just how much

1836
01:42:43,712 --> 01:42:44,480
Of

1837
01:42:46,784 --> 01:42:47,808
It's difficult

1838
01:42:48,064 --> 01:42:50,368
How you would put it but I will put it as like

1839
01:42:50,880 --> 01:42:51,648
Eurocentric

1840
01:42:55,232 --> 01:42:57,280
Women did not smoke cigarettes

1841
01:43:06,240 --> 01:43:07,520
Cigars with lady

1842
01:43:09,568 --> 01:43:12,384
Should women wear gloves

1843
01:43:12,896 --> 01:43:14,432
The women with smoke in private

1844
01:43:15,712 --> 01:43:16,480
That was the style

1845
01:43:20,064 --> 01:43:21,088
Tobacco

1846
01:43:22,880 --> 01:43:24,160
By The Conquistadors

1847
01:43:24,416 --> 01:43:24,928
I digress

1848
01:43:28,512 --> 01:43:31,584
Tobacco to the European market

1849
01:43:31,840 --> 01:43:32,864
Trade

1850
01:43:33,120 --> 01:43:34,656
Envy like 1500

1851
01:43:34,912 --> 01:43:39,776
The discovery of tobacco

1852
01:43:40,288 --> 01:43:44,128
Introduction of tobacco happen for the Western world

1853
01:43:44,384 --> 01:43:46,176
The native peoples of North America

1854
01:43:46,432 --> 01:43:50,016
Tobacco ceremony

1855
01:43:50,272 --> 01:43:50,784
Portrayed

1856
01:43:51,040 --> 01:43:52,064
Possibly as far back as

1857
01:43:52,320 --> 01:43:53,600
Is 4000 years prior

1858
01:43:54,368 --> 01:43:56,672
Alex's condescending psych but I digress

1859
01:43:56,928 --> 01:43:58,464
As if to imply

1860
01:43:58,720 --> 01:44:00,000
Getting into some area that has a

1861
01:44:00,256 --> 01:44:01,024
Deep knowledge about

1862
01:44:01,280 --> 01:44:02,816
But it's Crystal Clear that

1863
01:44:03,072 --> 01:44:04,096
He has is it

1864
01:44:04,352 --> 01:44:05,888
Is a piece of distorted knowledge

1865
01:44:06,144 --> 01:44:08,960
On the subject of central European involved

1866
01:44:13,568 --> 01:44:16,896
This is such a clear-cut example of that mentality that Alex has that makes

1867
01:44:17,152 --> 01:44:18,944
I'm such an unreliable narrator

1868
01:44:19,200 --> 01:44:20,224
About history and culture

1869
01:44:20,736 --> 01:44:22,016
He doesn't know what he's talking about

1870
01:44:22,528 --> 01:44:23,552
Anniversary music

1871
01:44:24,576 --> 01:44:25,344
Population

1872
01:44:25,600 --> 01:44:27,648
He doesn't identify with

1873
01:44:28,416 --> 01:44:34,560
That's a fair way to put everybody else

1874
01:44:34,816 --> 01:44:35,840
Convert them to this b*******

1875
01:44:38,144 --> 01:44:41,728
I was being generous with eurocentric packed

1876
01:44:41,984 --> 01:44:44,288
I think while I was going over it I was struggling

1877
01:44:44,544 --> 01:44:45,568

Your logical disorder is exploding

1888
01:45:19,616 --> 01:45:22,176
Conscious

1889
01:45:29,600 --> 01:45:32,160
Until they get him to eat the blood

1890
01:45:32,416 --> 01:45:33,184
Portrait children

1891
01:45:36,256 --> 01:45:37,792

01:46:02,368 --> 01:46:02,880
Everything

1897
01:46:04,160 --> 01:46:07,232
Not real

1898
01:46:09,792 --> 01:46:11,584
Very aggressive

1899
01:46:12,352 --> 01:46:15,168

1904
01:46:38,208 --> 01:46:40,000
San Francisco

1905
01:46:40,256 --> 01:46:45,120

Is that so

1916
01:47:40,928 --> 01:47:42,976

01:47:46,560 --> 01:47:47,072
Alex

1919
01:47:47,328 --> 01:47:48,864
Talking about

1920
01:47:50,656 --> 01:47:51,424
Abortion

1921
01:47:52,704 --> 01:47:58,848
Of the day before

1922
01:48:00,384 --> 01:48:03,968
I think maybe she felt bad about all the murder last episode

1923
01:48:04,224 --> 01:48:08,064
I like the rat I like that

1924
01:48:08,832 --> 01:48:09,344

01:48:09,856 --> 01:48:11,904

01:48:12,160 --> 01:48:13,440
Abortion that's pretty cool

1927
01:48:14,720 --> 01:48:15,232
I can do the abortion

1928
01:48:15,488 --> 01:48:19,584
Stop cuz it's it's all good coming out of my mouth I really feel like I can do better this time

1929
01:48:21,120 --> 01:48:22,144
Kill all humans

1930
01:48:22,400 --> 01:48:24,704
I got to redo that one too

1931
01:48:24,960 --> 01:48:27,776
So he also is on a real vampire tip

1932
01:48:28,032 --> 01:48:30,080
Call Nyssa episodes

1933
01:48:30,592 --> 01:48:32,896
So there's a lot of abortion vampire is

1934
01:48:33,408 --> 01:48:34,176
Going on

1935
01:48:34,432 --> 01:48:35,456
Here is

1936
01:48:35,712 --> 01:48:36,224
Answer to start

1937
01:48:37,504 --> 01:48:38,784
What's Facebook real heart

1938
01:48:39,040 --> 01:48:40,064

01:48:47,488 --> 01:48:48,768
Charizard

1940
01:48:49,792 --> 01:48:53,120
What does Carol mean

1941
01:48:56,192 --> 01:48:57,728
Drink the blood of the baby like three

1942
01:49:03,360 --> 01:49:06,176
They'll torture The Living Daylights out of your baby

1943
01:49:06,688 --> 01:49:08,992
This is the blood libel but also Alex

1944
01:49:09,248 --> 01:49:10,784
It's so funny

1945
01:49:11,296 --> 01:49:12,064
Fade

1946
01:49:12,576 --> 01:49:17,696
The movie they're drinking the baby

1947
01:49:18,976 --> 01:49:23,584
The fuk I can't I can't get lost in

1948
01:49:23,840 --> 01:49:29,216
Exactly

1949
01:49:30,240 --> 01:49:32,032
Fair enough

1950
01:49:32,288 --> 01:49:34,336
Greatest living on the cob

1951
01:49:39,712 --> 01:49:40,224
Write them

1952
01:49:45,088 --> 01:49:47,136
The favourites to a three-year-old cuz I can hear you

1953
01:49:47,392 --> 01:49:48,160
Mama

1954
01:49:49,696 --> 01:49:50,208
Whale song

1955
01:49:51,232 --> 01:49:52,256
You know a lot

1956
01:49:53,280 --> 01:49:53,792
Maybe too much

1957
01:49:55,328 --> 01:49:56,352
She at works now

1958
01:49:57,120 --> 01:49:59,424
Save-A-Lot on episode

1959
01:49:59,936 --> 01:50:05,568
Now that wouldn't be how it works

1960
01:50:05,824 --> 01:50:08,384
Reality

1961
01:50:08,896 --> 01:50:12,480
Like I stopped in the middle of clip Point classical

1962
01:50:13,248 --> 01:50:14,272
This is narrative

1963
01:50:14,528 --> 01:50:17,344
That is deeply rooted

1964
01:50:17,600 --> 01:50:18,112
Semitism

1965
01:50:18,368 --> 01:50:20,160
He's just applying it to his enemies

1966
01:50:20,416 --> 01:50:25,280
Either because he wants his audience to know I mean the Jews or

1967
01:50:25,536 --> 01:50:27,840
He just had some sort of an awareness that this work

1968
01:50:28,096 --> 01:50:30,400
Yeah they did a really great job using this against the

1969
01:50:30,656 --> 01:50:32,960
So why not use it against everybody

1970
01:50:33,216 --> 01:50:37,312
You know how like that's the problem with this horrible thing it was used racist

1971
01:50:37,824 --> 01:50:39,872
Now we just need to use it on everybody but why

1972
01:50:44,992 --> 01:50:45,760
Your hearing

1973
01:50:47,552 --> 01:50:51,648
It's almost old hadn't right for us to bring up cuz I was does it still f****** much but

1974
01:50:52,160 --> 01:50:53,952
If you're characterizing your enemies

1975
01:50:54,976 --> 01:50:56,768
That they're drinking blood of children

1976
01:50:57,024 --> 01:50:58,560
Prefer two to three year olds

1977
01:50:58,816 --> 01:50:59,840
Because they're old enough to see

1978
01:51:00,096 --> 01:51:00,864
Scream for their mother

1979
01:51:01,376 --> 01:51:02,144
What the f***

1980
01:51:02,400 --> 01:51:03,168
Wouldn't you do too

1981
01:51:03,680 --> 01:51:05,216
Like what the fuc

1982
01:51:05,472 --> 01:51:06,496
Is off-limits

1983
01:51:06,752 --> 01:51:07,264
To do today

1984
01:51:08,288 --> 01:51:09,312
Cuz we if you don't

1985
01:51:10,592 --> 01:51:12,128
Who's to say your kid isn't neck

1986
01:51:17,248 --> 01:51:18,016
Painted these people

1987
01:51:21,600 --> 01:51:22,880
He continues to do so in this

1988
01:51:23,136 --> 01:51:24,160
But what he does

1989
01:51:25,440 --> 01:51:25,952
Is mixed

1990
01:51:26,208 --> 01:51:26,720
Clear

1991
01:51:27,232 --> 01:51:29,024
These people who are a member of

1992
01:51:29,280 --> 01:51:30,560
Vampire cult

1993
01:51:30,816 --> 01:51:33,376
Everybody

1994
01:51:33,888 --> 01:51:34,656
And all

1995
01:51:40,288 --> 01:51:42,080
Women

1996
01:51:42,336 --> 01:51:46,944
Talking about how they have orgasms

1997
01:51:50,528 --> 01:51:52,320
Hugo

1998
01:51:55,648 --> 01:51:56,160
Abortion

1999
01:51:56,672 --> 01:51:57,696
And women show up

2000
01:52:01,792 --> 01:52:03,072
I just mess it up

2001
01:52:20,480 --> 01:52:21,504
There's a spirit

2002
01:52:22,016 --> 01:52:23,040
They're vampires

2003
01:52:36,352 --> 01:52:40,192
I took like what you just like what like what

2004
01:52:40,448 --> 01:52:46,592
Destroyer you got to let it go

2005
01:52:47,104 --> 01:52:48,896
Just gotta gotta

2006
01:52:49,152 --> 01:52:52,736
You know tonight if you got to give yourself the Serenity Prayer

2007
01:52:53,248 --> 01:52:53,760
Do you have to

2008
01:52:54,016 --> 01:53:00,160
I will not fear fear is the mind-killer fear is not a reference

2009
01:53:02,208 --> 01:53:03,488
I I mean that

2010
01:53:03,744 --> 01:53:04,256
Adjust

2011
01:53:04,512 --> 01:53:05,024
Insanity

2012
01:53:05,536 --> 01:53:10,912
It's crazy it's really important abortion

2013
01:53:11,168 --> 01:53:13,216
Orgasm story

2014
01:53:13,472 --> 01:53:16,288
But then starts talking about

2015
01:53:18,848 --> 01:53:21,408
First of all

2016
01:53:29,600 --> 01:53:30,368
I've seen the videos

2017
01:53:32,928 --> 01:53:38,304
So it's weird that you have this situation where it's like both of these things are people f******

2018
01:53:38,816 --> 01:53:40,864
It's turned into reality

2019
01:53:41,888 --> 01:53:43,680
It's very sad

2020
01:53:43,936 --> 01:53:46,496
If it wasn't the situation where we had States

2021
01:53:46,752 --> 01:53:47,264
Acid

2022
01:53:47,776 --> 01:53:48,544
Fictive laws in

2023
01:53:48,800 --> 01:53:50,592
Women are going to die because of it

2024
01:53:51,104 --> 01:53:52,640
There's a tent

2025
01:53:53,152 --> 01:53:53,920
It's really f******

2026
01:53:54,176 --> 01:53:55,200
Scary

2027
01:53:55,712 --> 01:53:58,784
If I were looking at this like an anthropologist

2028
01:53:59,040 --> 01:53:59,808
Be very interesting

2029
01:54:00,064 --> 01:54:02,112
Did you see him as this figure

2030
01:54:02,624 --> 01:54:03,904
Who was so stupid

2031
01:54:04,160 --> 01:54:08,000
That he made a career thinking people f****** with him was real

2032
01:54:08,512 --> 01:54:10,304
There is almost it

2033
01:54:11,328 --> 01:54:14,400
I don't disappoint archetypical feel to it like the buffoon

2034
01:54:15,680 --> 01:54:17,216
Yeah yeah I see what you're saying

2035
01:54:17,472 --> 01:54:20,288
The fool who manages to trick tons of people into

2036
01:54:20,800 --> 01:54:21,824
Funding his idiot

2037
01:54:22,080 --> 01:54:22,592
Right

2038
01:54:23,104 --> 01:54:25,152
It's very it's very interesting devoid of

2039
01:54:25,408 --> 01:54:26,432
The consequence

2040
01:54:27,968 --> 01:54:31,296
But it's really sad

2041
01:54:31,552 --> 01:54:32,320
Ba really in

2042
01:54:33,088 --> 01:54:36,928
Time to be

2043
01:54:37,184 --> 01:54:42,560
Progress can be made

2044
01:54:42,816 --> 01:54:43,584
So

2045
01:54:43,840 --> 01:54:45,376
He brought up the rat story for a real

2046
01:54:45,888 --> 01:54:47,680
Is because

2047
01:54:47,936 --> 01:54:49,984
There is something he wants to couple

2048
01:54:50,240 --> 01:54:50,752
With that Braxton

2049
01:54:51,520 --> 01:54:52,288
The wrap bar

2050
01:54:52,544 --> 01:54:53,824
He's already kind of dumb

2051
01:54:58,432 --> 01:55:00,992
You know

2052
01:55:03,296 --> 01:55:05,344
Is it because that's what this story is to him

2053
01:55:05,856 --> 01:55:07,136
That's where this story live

2054
01:55:07,392 --> 01:55:08,928
And that's why you is willing

2055
01:55:09,184 --> 01:55:09,696
Going to cover it

2056
01:55:09,952 --> 01:55:10,464
Even though it's

2057
01:55:10,976 --> 01:55:11,488

2065
01:55:33,248 --> 01:55:33,760
Immigrants

2066
01:55:34,016 --> 01:55:34,528
Bratz

2067
01:55:35,296 --> 01:55:38,368
Those

2068
01:55:41,696 --> 01:55:44,000
Interstate we should at least

2069
01:56:03,200 --> 01:56:05,248
Rescue Ranch

2070
01:56:05,504 --> 01:56:07,552
With you a little rat turds

2071
01:56:08,064 --> 01:56:13,440
I think he's thinking of Chip and Dale Rescue Rangers

2072
01:56:30,080 --> 01:56:30,592
Yeah

2073
01:56:31,360 --> 01:56:32,896
Lady

2074
01:56:33,408 --> 01:56:38,784
I only remember monterey jack

2075
01:56:39,040 --> 01:56:39,808
Condor

2076
01:56:40,064 --> 01:56:41,344
No.5

2077
01:56:43,392 --> 01:56:47,232
The second what was secret of nim had also had.

2078
01:56:49,024 --> 01:56:50,048
The Rats of nym

2079
01:56:50,560 --> 01:56:56,704
Very powerful redwall however

2080
01:56:56,960 --> 01:56:57,984
I'm not a dork

2081
01:56:59,008 --> 01:57:04,128
So that's the one

2082
01:57:04,896 --> 01:57:05,664
Jaja Gabor

2083
01:57:06,432 --> 01:57:07,200
So

2084
01:57:07,456 --> 01:57:11,808
It's quite a bit

2085
01:57:13,088 --> 01:57:14,112
Because he wants to reinforce

2086
01:57:14,368 --> 01:57:15,136
Nobody's talking about it

2087
01:57:16,672 --> 01:57:17,952
They're bringing disease

2088
01:57:18,720 --> 01:57:20,256
Or border agents

2089
01:57:25,120 --> 01:57:25,888
She also needs to go

2090
01:57:26,144 --> 01:57:29,472
Back to actually talk about the orgasm

2091
01:57:29,984 --> 01:57:30,496
Tori

2092
01:57:31,008 --> 01:57:31,520
But man

2093
01:57:34,336 --> 01:57:36,896
It's exactly a mirror of the last day here too

2094
01:57:37,152 --> 01:57:38,432
Trying to present the idea that

2095
01:57:38,944 --> 01:57:39,456
Too hard to cut

2096
01:57:48,160 --> 01:57:54,304
Somatic

2097
01:57:54,560 --> 01:58:00,448
Got it

2098
01:58:01,728 --> 01:58:05,824
Traversing

2099
01:58:11,712 --> 01:58:16,064
I'll just be honest with you, that's for about an hour during the breaks

2100
01:58:25,792 --> 01:58:27,328
I just can't do it

2101
01:58:29,120 --> 01:58:30,912
And when you say that you're not

2102
01:58:32,704 --> 01:58:33,984
Yeah

2103
01:58:34,240 --> 01:58:35,008
Performative

2104
01:58:35,264 --> 01:58:36,800
You didn't even really get into anything

2105
01:58:37,056 --> 01:58:38,592
All that different than what he got in

2106
01:58:38,848 --> 01:58:40,896
Into the day before there's nothing

2107
01:58:41,152 --> 01:58:41,664
Pathetic

2108
01:58:42,688 --> 01:58:43,200
So

2109
01:58:43,456 --> 01:58:44,224
Which would you go

2110
01:58:45,760 --> 01:58:47,552
Ouroboros

2111
01:58:48,576 --> 01:58:49,856
The prior

2112
01:58:50,112 --> 01:58:51,392
How about

2113
01:58:52,672 --> 01:58:56,768
Probably that one I like a composition portmanteau though so that one

2114
01:58:57,024 --> 01:59:00,096
Is probably

2115
01:59:00,352 --> 01:59:00,864
Too late now

2116
01:59:01,376 --> 01:59:03,168
So I slept Alex

2117
01:59:03,424 --> 01:59:05,216
Because it's too hard you can't get into

2118
01:59:05,984 --> 01:59:06,496
It again

2119
01:59:06,752 --> 01:59:07,520
Is just not

2120
01:59:09,312 --> 01:59:09,824
Hugh

2121
01:59:10,336 --> 01:59:14,944
Wants to talk about how everyone out there so much for the info War

2122
01:59:16,992 --> 01:59:17,760
Speaking as Alex

2123
01:59:19,552 --> 01:59:21,600
Go to learn how to make documentaries

2124
01:59:24,672 --> 01:59:25,184
Right

2125
01:59:25,440 --> 01:59:27,488
So he's trying to inspire his audience

2126
01:59:27,744 --> 01:59:29,024
To get involved and do things

2127
01:59:29,536 --> 01:59:33,376
He's advising them to do things that they should absolutely

2128
01:59:33,632 --> 01:59:35,680
Now maybe they're not as bad as

2129
01:59:35,936 --> 01:59:40,032
The day before

2130
01:59:40,288 --> 01:59:41,312
But this is this

2131
01:59:41,568 --> 01:59:42,080
Is Darkrai

2132
01:59:42,336 --> 01:59:44,640
This first one is you want people to just Honey Trap

2133
01:59:51,808 --> 01:59:56,416
Usually go incredibly well

2134
01:59:56,672 --> 02:00:00,768
Yeah a lot of people on an amateur level do it

2135
02:00:01,024 --> 02:00:03,584
It's usually a crime

2136
02:00:03,840 --> 02:00:04,864
Back on very

2137
02:00:05,120 --> 02:00:06,400
Fondly whatever the

2138
02:00:09,472 --> 02:00:11,008
Alex

2139
02:00:11,264 --> 02:00:12,032
Go trick people

2140
02:00:18,176 --> 02:00:19,712
If you're a good-looking woman

2141
02:00:21,248 --> 02:00:24,320
You can do in any City or any County Democrat

2142
02:00:24,832 --> 02:00:27,904
They're going to be pedophiles drug addict

2143
02:00:34,816 --> 02:00:35,840
And then lie about them

2144
02:00:40,448 --> 02:00:44,032
Sometimes they can't

2145
02:00:48,128 --> 02:00:49,920
When you realize that

2146
02:00:52,224 --> 02:00:56,064
Every project video is someone saying

2147
02:01:03,488 --> 02:01:08,608
Caricatures

2148
02:01:09,120 --> 02:01:15,264
46 videos are almost too perfect

2149
02:01:15,520 --> 02:01:19,616
Because there

2150
02:01:19,872 --> 02:01:24,224
Doing it to be characters

2151
02:01:24,480 --> 02:01:27,296
Because it's so irresistible to the right with me

2152
02:01:27,552 --> 02:01:28,320
Becomes the gray

2153
02:01:28,576 --> 02:01:30,624
Latest cottage industry possible

2154
02:01:30,880 --> 02:01:31,904
Yeah he's so closed

2155
02:01:32,160 --> 02:01:32,672
Digistream like

2156
02:01:33,440 --> 02:01:36,512
Understand

2157
02:01:36,768 --> 02:01:37,280
I don't think he does

2158
02:01:37,536 --> 02:01:43,168
He's not crazy to the conclusion that

2159
02:01:43,424 --> 02:01:46,240
I think that what we've seen like with the the

2160
02:01:46,496 --> 02:01:47,776
The troll article and

2161
02:01:48,288 --> 02:01:48,800
Of course

2162
02:01:49,056 --> 02:01:51,360
Women yelling I love

2163
02:01:51,872 --> 02:01:55,456
He's very easily tricked by things he wants to get

2164
02:01:55,712 --> 02:01:59,040
Project Veritas videos

2165
02:01:59,296 --> 02:02:02,112
Considering

2166
02:02:02,624 --> 02:02:08,768
Did you ever notice how they so conveniently fit our narratives almost as if they were doctored and Ed

2167
02:02:09,024 --> 02:02:12,864
Edited to look that way

2168
02:02:13,376 --> 02:02:19,520
It's almost like they were created service

2169
02:02:19,776 --> 02:02:25,920
Dude like 100,000

2170
02:02:26,176 --> 02:02:32,320
Federal prison for breaking into a

2171
02:02:34,368 --> 02:02:36,416
Congressperson to office under false pretense

2172
02:02:36,928 --> 02:02:38,720
Really surprised he's not in prison

2173
02:02:39,744 --> 02:02:42,048
That would have been a smart move

2174
02:02:45,120 --> 02:02:47,168
He has just basically as honey pot people

2175
02:02:48,192 --> 02:02:52,288
Then the next one is a little bit more troubling because of what it is

2176
02:02:52,544 --> 02:02:53,568
Implies would be the

2177
02:02:53,824 --> 02:02:54,592
End result of doing

2178
02:03:04,320 --> 02:03:07,392
Storytime

2179
02:03:13,024 --> 02:03:13,792
Private investigation

2180
02:03:14,048 --> 02:03:16,864
System thinking

2181
02:03:21,216 --> 02:03:23,008
One group you can Target

2182
02:03:27,872 --> 02:03:28,384
Isn't

2183
02:03:28,640 --> 02:03:31,456
Incredibly sucked up for a number of reasons

2184
02:03:33,504 --> 02:03:37,600
I guess stake the place out and find out whose car is who or else you're just going to be

2185
02:03:39,136 --> 02:03:42,976
Cars

2186
02:03:43,232 --> 02:03:45,792
I mean Alex's assuming the conclusion you're going to

2187
02:03:46,048 --> 02:03:49,376
Defined before you actually even start looking into something which is

2188
02:03:49,888 --> 02:03:51,424
Not a healthy way to do things

2189
02:03:52,192 --> 02:03:55,776
And then ultimately what you would end up doing is

2190
02:03:56,032 --> 02:03:59,360
I would assume you probably wouldn't find that many sex offenders

2191
02:03:59,616 --> 02:04:02,688
And what you would still want to do with that information is public

2192
02:04:09,344 --> 02:04:10,368
Email address

2193
02:04:10,624 --> 02:04:15,232
This doesn't come from a place of wanting to

2194
02:04:15,744 --> 02:04:17,280
Children

2195
02:04:17,536 --> 02:04:22,144
People creating a vigilante Posse

2196
02:04:28,544 --> 02:04:32,896
I'm certain there's going to be so many sex offenders in there

2197
02:04:33,920 --> 02:04:39,040
As opposed to creating a database of people who you think deserve Target

2198
02:04:39,808 --> 02:04:42,880
Here's one group you can Target is not a sentence

2199
02:04:43,136 --> 02:04:45,696
Is ever worked out well in the end

2200
02:04:49,792 --> 02:04:51,584
Target

2201
02:04:52,608 --> 02:04:53,888
Why you why you doing that

2202
02:04:54,144 --> 02:04:54,656
That's sneaky

2203
02:04:57,728 --> 02:04:58,240
It's back to

2204
02:05:00,288 --> 02:05:01,056
Catalog article

2205
02:05:03,104 --> 02:05:05,152
He reads it again

2206
02:05:05,408 --> 02:05:07,456
Yes god dammit

2207
02:05:07,968 --> 02:05:09,760
To do a different kind of creepy

2208
02:05:10,272 --> 02:05:12,576
Woman celebrates her abortion

2209
02:05:13,088 --> 02:05:13,856
YouTube

2210
02:05:14,624 --> 02:05:15,904
There's another woman celebrating

2211
02:05:16,416 --> 02:05:20,512
That is a difference later that is another

2212
02:05:21,536 --> 02:05:24,352
Who wrote that's a different story

2213
02:05:24,608 --> 02:05:26,656
That he uses as support for that

2214
02:05:27,424 --> 02:05:29,216
Can we stop pretending

2215
02:05:29,984 --> 02:05:31,776
Like abortions don't feel

2216
02:05:35,360 --> 02:05:38,176
You talk about it

2217
02:05:39,200 --> 02:05:40,480
I come really hard

2218
02:05:45,344 --> 02:05:47,392
Linda Blair

2219
02:05:48,160 --> 02:05:49,696
Sexy voice

2220
02:05:50,208 --> 02:05:56,352
Sexy

2221
02:05:58,144 --> 02:06:01,216
That's actually not even a back of the uterus

2222
02:06:27,584 --> 02:06:29,120
Chatting

2223
02:06:32,960 --> 02:06:34,496
David Outback if you walk

2224
02:06:38,848 --> 02:06:40,128
Ben & Jerry's

2225
02:06:51,392 --> 02:06:53,184
Impressionism

2226
02:06:53,696 --> 02:06:54,208
Pittsfield

2227
02:06:54,464 --> 02:06:58,304
Weirdly less sincere than his horny voice

2228
02:06:58,560 --> 02:06:59,328
Sincerely

2229
02:06:59,840 --> 02:07:02,656
Sincere than is Northam impression

2230
02:07:05,728 --> 02:07:07,264
Natural

2231
02:07:07,520 --> 02:07:09,056
X10

2232
02:07:09,824 --> 02:07:14,432
Yeah yeah that might be what I'm responding to

2233
02:07:14,944 --> 02:07:15,968
Feels

2234
02:07:18,528 --> 02:07:20,576
You still covering the story

2235
02:07:20,832 --> 02:07:26,976
There's a misconception within the story

2236
02:07:27,232 --> 02:07:28,512
About to f*** with people like him

2237
02:07:28,768 --> 02:07:29,792
Of its

2238
02:07:30,048 --> 02:07:31,072
This misconception is

2239
02:07:31,840 --> 02:07:32,608
She thinks

2240
02:07:33,120 --> 02:07:33,632
Coming

2241
02:07:33,888 --> 02:07:34,912
When she gets an abortion

2242
02:07:36,960 --> 02:07:37,472
Not true

2243
02:07:37,728 --> 02:07:38,752
Search for someone else

2244
02:07:39,008 --> 02:07:39,520
Who's coming

2245
02:07:46,944 --> 02:07:52,320
Cyanotype

2246
02:08:03,072 --> 02:08:09,216
Okay.

2247
02:08:22,784 --> 02:08:24,576
Pictures of God

2248
02:08:25,344 --> 02:08:26,368
The spiteful

Proud Buster's

2250
02:08:28,160 --> 02:08:30,208
Inventors of evil things

2251
02:08:31,232 --> 02:08:32,768
Disobedient to parents

2252
02:08:36,096 --> 02:08:36,608
130

2253
02:08:37,376 --> 02:08:38,912
Skidim Alex

2254
02:08:40,448 --> 02:08:42,240
Drop that scripture

2255
02:08:43,008 --> 02:08:45,824
I believe it was Mozart who mastered

2256
02:08:46,080 --> 02:08:47,104
The classical demon

2257
02:08:47,872 --> 02:08:50,176
Yeah comparatively Alex

2258
02:08:59,648 --> 02:09:00,160
Look

2259
02:09:00,928 --> 02:09:02,208
Previous day Alex

2260
02:09:05,792 --> 02:09:06,560
Maybe not ever

2261
02:09:06,816 --> 02:09:09,888
You could do worse eventually

2262
02:09:10,144 --> 02:09:11,680
It's going to be worse than that

2263
02:09:11,936 --> 02:09:12,960
But this

2264
02:09:13,216 --> 02:09:14,496
Is so weird

2265
02:09:15,008 --> 02:09:17,056
So

2266
02:09:17,312 --> 02:09:17,824
2 videos

2267
02:09:18,080 --> 02:09:19,360
Expressing support for abortion

2268
02:09:19,872 --> 02:09:23,456
And on the side of beef

2269
02:09:23,712 --> 02:09:24,480
Laws are being passed

2270
02:09:24,736 --> 02:09:26,016
What's good for her

2271
02:09:27,296 --> 02:09:28,064
And

2272
02:09:28,320 --> 02:09:29,344
This is Alex's response

2273
02:09:29,600 --> 02:09:30,112
To that which

2274
02:09:30,368 --> 02:09:31,904
Well not calling for violence

2275
02:09:32,160 --> 02:09:32,672
Storzer

2276
02:09:32,928 --> 02:09:33,440
Is

2277
02:09:34,720 --> 02:09:35,232
Violin

2278
02:09:36,256 --> 02:09:37,792
Miley Cyrus

2279
02:09:39,328 --> 02:09:41,376
Simulator

2280
02:09:41,888 --> 02:09:44,448
Abortion and the sexual

2281
02:09:49,056 --> 02:09:50,080
Miley Cyrus

2282
02:09:50,592 --> 02:09:52,128
Excruciating

2283
02:09:52,384 --> 02:09:52,896
Death

2284
02:09:55,968 --> 02:09:57,504
And sooner rather than later

2285
02:09:58,016 --> 02:09:59,808
I bet Miley Cyrus

2286
02:10:02,624 --> 02:10:04,928
It's going to be very very

2287
02:10:08,768 --> 02:10:09,792
Justice must be

2288
02:10:11,328 --> 02:10:17,472
I mean we already heard him say do you know if it's God's justice sometimes you're the tool of Justice

2289
02:10:17,728 --> 02:10:18,496
So if

2290
02:10:18,752 --> 02:10:20,800
Can you predict who's going to be dead in ten years

2291
02:10:21,056 --> 02:10:22,592
I don't know how one of his listeners is

2292
02:10:22,848 --> 02:10:24,384
Going to give her a painful cancer but

2293
02:10:24,896 --> 02:10:26,688
I mean it's f***** up just

2294
02:10:26,944 --> 02:10:29,504
Relishing

2295
02:10:33,856 --> 02:10:36,672
If she was still Hannah Montana

2296
02:10:37,952 --> 02:10:38,464
So

2297
02:10:39,232 --> 02:10:40,512
It's always interesting

2298
02:10:40,768 --> 02:10:43,328
Serta consider what Alex is intention

2299
02:10:43,840 --> 02:10:46,144
To report facts

2300
02:10:46,400 --> 02:10:47,936
So you really trying to be a journalist

2301
02:10:48,704 --> 02:10:51,264
A little bit of a glimpse

2302
02:10:51,520 --> 02:10:52,800
How he sees himself

2303
02:10:53,824 --> 02:10:55,616
In the Greater Media sphere

2304
02:10:56,128 --> 02:11:02,016
Everything

2305
02:11:03,040 --> 02:11:03,808
I know you know that

2306
02:11:11,488 --> 02:11:12,000

Set up for a long time

2310
02:11:20,960 --> 02:11:21,728
Different ways of expressing

2311
02:11:22,496 --> 02:11:23,008
Live like

I mean like what

2315
02:11:34,528 --> 02:11:37,600
If the things are making them angry about our lives

2316
02:11:38,368 --> 02:11:38,880
What is that

2317
02:11:39,392 --> 02:11:41,952
If the things you're making them angry about our

2318
02:11:42,208 --> 02:11:43,744
Specifically tailored towards

2319
02:11:44,000 --> 02:11:45,792
Protecting White

2320
02:11:46,304 --> 02:11:47,840
Why are you making them angry

2321
02:11:48,096 --> 02:11:49,632
What is the end result you wish

2322
02:11:49,888 --> 02:11:52,192
To see if you're making people angry

2323
02:11:52,448 --> 02:11:53,472
Lying about abortion

2324
02:11:53,984 --> 02:11:55,264
Lying about

2325
02:11:55,520 --> 02:11:57,312
People at drag queen story time

2326
02:11:59,360 --> 02:12:00,896
Maybe God wants you to kill Anderson

2327
02:12:02,432 --> 02:12:03,200
What are you doing

2328
02:12:03,712 --> 02:12:04,992
What the Cure

2329
02:12:05,760 --> 02:12:09,088
Making people angry is not waking them up out of there

2330
02:12:09,344 --> 02:12:10,880
Media delusion

2331
02:12:11,136 --> 02:12:13,184
There's Tacoma with the MSM

2332
02:12:13,696 --> 02:12:15,232
What you're doing is

2333
02:12:16,000 --> 02:12:17,536
Inspirational terrorism

2334
02:12:18,048 --> 02:12:19,840
That's what you're making people angry

2335
02:12:20,096 --> 02:12:22,912
You're trying to rile them up to the point where they commit

2336
02:12:23,168 --> 02:12:23,680
A crime

2337
02:12:23,936 --> 02:12:25,472
That is what you doing

2338
02:12:25,728 --> 02:12:28,544
You don't make people angry

2339
02:12:28,800 --> 02:12:30,592
Unless you are looking for an action

2340
02:12:31,616 --> 02:12:34,944
He's describing I'm here's what I'm doing I'm trying to

2341
02:12:37,248 --> 02:12:39,040
But that emotion is

2342
02:12:39,296 --> 02:12:40,320
Only

2343
02:12:40,832 --> 02:12:42,880
It's only valuable if

2344
02:12:43,904 --> 02:12:45,440
Channel it into an actual action

2345
02:12:45,696 --> 02:12:46,976
If you're making people angry

2346
02:12:47,232 --> 02:12:48,000
About house

2347
02:12:48,512 --> 02:12:50,048
Their babies are getting murdered

2348
02:12:50,560 --> 02:12:52,096
Then your actual intent

2349
02:12:52,352 --> 02:12:54,144
Is for the action that follows

2350
02:12:54,400 --> 02:12:55,680
After that

2351
02:12:56,704 --> 02:12:57,472
I think

2352
02:12:57,728 --> 02:12:59,264
In previous times

2353
02:12:59,776 --> 02:13:01,056
The action

2354
02:13:01,568 --> 02:13:05,408
Since so much of the rhetoric is punching upward toward

2355
02:13:05,664 --> 02:13:07,456
Either group that don't exist

2356
02:13:07,712 --> 02:13:08,736
I either globalist

2357
02:13:09,248 --> 02:13:10,528
Or the UN

2358
02:13:10,784 --> 02:13:12,064
Or the administration

2359
02:13:12,320 --> 02:13:13,600
Who are almost abstract

2360
02:13:14,112 --> 02:13:16,672
The action you wish for

2361
02:13:17,952 --> 02:13:19,488
Subscription to buy magazine

2362
02:13:19,744 --> 02:13:20,768
Buy my products

2363
02:13:22,048 --> 02:13:23,584
Is tailored towards that

2364
02:13:24,096 --> 02:13:24,864
In the present day

2365
02:13:25,888 --> 02:13:26,656
Is

2366
02:13:27,168 --> 02:13:27,680
The same

2367
02:13:27,936 --> 02:13:28,704
Instinct

2368
02:13:29,984 --> 02:13:32,544
Drive of shaking people out of the coma

2369
02:13:32,800 --> 02:13:34,336
Make it a banger

2370
02:13:34,592 --> 02:13:35,360
But the action

2371
02:13:35,616 --> 02:13:36,128
Is

2372
02:13:36,640 --> 02:13:38,432
Doc's people who are at the

2373
02:13:38,688 --> 02:13:41,760
Storytime Honey Trap

2374
02:13:42,016 --> 02:13:48,160
Were you manipulative Lee edit video in order to demonize somebody was working for a social good

2375
02:13:49,184 --> 02:13:49,952
Kill Anderson Cooper

2376
02:13:50,208 --> 02:13:52,000
Yeah

2377
02:13:52,256 --> 02:13:53,024
Call Monique

2378
02:13:53,280 --> 02:13:58,912
Probably relevance of it before maybe not as over

2379
02:13:59,168 --> 02:14:00,192
Is category

2380
02:14:00,960 --> 02:14:01,728
Inspiration

2381
02:14:01,984 --> 02:14:06,592
Terrorism

2382
02:14:06,848 --> 02:14:08,640
For a long time

2383
02:14:08,896 --> 02:14:10,176
Mach the crime pivot

2384
02:14:12,992 --> 02:14:17,856
Telling people that commit genocide

2385
02:14:19,648 --> 02:14:20,928
Crazy as these episodes

2386
02:14:21,184 --> 02:14:22,720
Seats two episodes work

2387
02:14:22,976 --> 02:14:25,536
This is this is a different level.

2388
02:14:27,328 --> 02:14:31,680
Miley Cyrus is going to die painful death would have been in place

2389
02:14:31,936 --> 02:14:38,080
But he could see that any day you go to the zoo every day you're going to be like

2390
02:14:39,616 --> 02:14:41,920
Right there cuz he's up with the monkeys in The Monkey House

2391
02:14:42,176 --> 02:14:42,944
No big deal

2392
02:14:43,200 --> 02:14:46,272
You're whatever you go to the zoo penguins

2393
02:14:47,808 --> 02:14:49,344
Penguins

2394
02:14:49,600 --> 02:14:50,368
You're going to see those

2395
02:14:50,880 --> 02:14:52,160
And that's the

2396
02:14:52,416 --> 02:14:57,536
Is metaphoric I'm losing it

2397
02:14:57,792 --> 02:15:00,352
It doesn't happen everyday

2398
02:15:00,864 --> 02:15:01,632
But you don't always say

2399
02:15:01,888 --> 02:15:02,656
Yeah

2400
02:15:03,168 --> 02:15:06,496
So it is next clip Alex talks about how people whose

2401
02:15:06,752 --> 02:15:07,520
Proportion

2402
02:15:07,776 --> 02:15:08,544
Sweet dreams

2403
02:15:09,824 --> 02:15:11,872
Ebony plays that clip that you reference

2404
02:15:12,128 --> 02:15:13,152
Of the video

2405
02:15:13,408 --> 02:15:14,944
Of a woman having an orgasm

2406
02:15:15,200 --> 02:15:16,736
Wow getting a divorce

2407
02:15:16,992 --> 02:15:19,040
Which is using to justify

2408
02:15:20,064 --> 02:15:21,344
Covering that article

2409
02:15:24,160 --> 02:15:28,256
Show up

2410
02:15:29,024 --> 02:15:31,072
You don't want to harm

2411
02:15:45,152 --> 02:15:47,200
If so why

2412
02:15:47,456 --> 02:15:49,248
My dad calls

2413
02:15:50,528 --> 02:15:54,368
Where's your dad

2414
02:15:55,392 --> 02:15:56,160
Literature

2415
02:15:56,416 --> 02:15:58,208
Scientific reports

2416
02:16:01,280 --> 02:16:02,048
And then

2417
02:16:02,304 --> 02:16:05,888
Color

2418
02:16:11,520 --> 02:16:13,312
Want

2419
02:16:16,128 --> 02:16:20,480
Women want to get on TV

2420
02:16:22,528 --> 02:16:24,576
But it's all the same spirit

2421
02:16:29,696 --> 02:16:32,768
So we goes to a video of a woman getting an abortion

2422
02:16:33,280 --> 02:16:35,840
She's holding hands with somebody who's off camera

2423
02:16:36,096 --> 02:16:37,120
She has her eyes closed

2424
02:16:37,376 --> 02:16:38,400
And that

2425
02:16:38,656 --> 02:16:39,168
Noise

2426
02:16:39,424 --> 02:16:43,264
Is what Alex is trying to present

2427
02:16:43,520 --> 02:16:46,336
Breezing through a medical procedure

2428
02:16:46,592 --> 02:16:47,872
That is what's going on

2429
02:16:48,128 --> 02:16:48,896
At the end of it

2430
02:16:49,152 --> 02:16:52,480
She gets wheeled away feels good

2431
02:16:52,736 --> 02:16:58,368
Not good like I came

2432
02:17:00,416 --> 02:17:01,440
So this is a woman who

2433
02:17:01,696 --> 02:17:04,256
Had made this video because

2434
02:17:04,512 --> 02:17:05,024
To create

2435
02:17:05,280 --> 02:17:07,840
Or help people understand that not every abortion

2436
02:17:08,096 --> 02:17:08,608
Experience

2437
02:17:08,864 --> 02:17:10,656
Is traumatic

2438
02:17:10,912 --> 02:17:12,192
Couple those ideas

2439
02:17:12,704 --> 02:17:15,264
Remove some of the stigma around

2440
02:17:15,520 --> 02:17:17,824
People feel

2441
02:17:18,080 --> 02:17:19,104
Thing to do I think it's

2442
02:17:19,360 --> 02:17:19,872
Probably

2443
02:17:20,128 --> 02:17:23,456
Most people would choose not to do for the amount of

2444
02:17:23,712 --> 02:17:27,296
Thrown your way

2445
02:17:27,552 --> 02:17:29,344
It's something that takes it

2446
02:17:32,672 --> 02:17:34,720
And this is what you get

2447
02:17:35,232 --> 02:17:37,024
You get Alex Jones saying you're orgasming

2448
02:17:37,280 --> 02:17:38,304
And misrepresenting

2449
02:17:38,560 --> 02:17:41,632
I don't know if her video had that f****** jonty music

2450
02:17:42,144 --> 02:17:45,472
But it's jarring is real it's real weird

2451
02:17:45,728 --> 02:17:48,288
I think it Alex might have added it in in order to

2452
02:17:48,544 --> 02:17:49,568
Skewer

2453
02:17:50,080 --> 02:17:50,592
Xperia

2454
02:17:50,848 --> 02:17:51,360
Yeah

2455
02:17:51,616 --> 02:17:53,664
Either way it's not

2456
02:17:53,920 --> 02:17:54,688
It's not orgasm

2457
02:17:54,944 --> 02:17:55,456
Enjoy

2458
02:17:55,968 --> 02:17:56,736
It's just completely

2459
02:17:56,992 --> 02:17:59,296
Misrepresenting that gas service of this article

2460
02:17:59,808 --> 02:18:00,832
And what may that be

2461
02:18:01,856 --> 02:18:03,648
Is that article

2462
02:18:04,160 --> 02:18:05,184
Had to have read it before

2463
02:18:05,440 --> 02:18:06,976
He had to read it years ago

2464
02:18:07,488 --> 02:18:11,584
It's been online for five years he had to have read it at some point and it's colored

2465
02:18:11,840 --> 02:18:12,608
His perception

2466
02:18:12,864 --> 02:18:14,144
Abortion

2467
02:18:14,912 --> 02:18:15,936
And it's the real sad

2468
02:18:16,704 --> 02:18:18,496
Yeah I agree that seems like the only conclusion

2469
02:18:20,288 --> 02:18:22,080
We've got one last clip here

2470
02:18:22,336 --> 02:18:25,152
And what it is

2471
02:18:25,664 --> 02:18:27,456
Taking Christianity

2472
02:18:27,968 --> 02:18:28,992
And repurposing it

2473
02:18:29,248 --> 02:18:30,272
N2 fitting

2474
02:18:30,528 --> 02:18:31,040
His world

2475
02:18:31,808 --> 02:18:32,320
Satan's world

2476
02:18:32,832 --> 02:18:33,344
Hear the devil

2477
02:18:33,856 --> 02:18:36,416
That is an interesting way to look at it because I mean

2478
02:18:36,672 --> 02:18:40,256
But he's twisting scripture you know who can

2479
02:18:40,512 --> 02:18:44,096
Scripture for his own purpose Daredevil

2480
02:18:44,352 --> 02:18:45,888
Interesting here is

2481
02:18:46,144 --> 02:18:49,472
Alex believes in Vampires he believes the globalist are vampires

2482
02:18:49,728 --> 02:18:50,240
Because he

2483
02:18:53,056 --> 02:18:53,568
And

2484
02:18:54,848 --> 02:18:55,872
Because he does

2485
02:18:56,640 --> 02:18:58,176
He has created a mythology

2486
02:18:58,432 --> 02:18:59,968
G around the ruling Elite

2487
02:19:02,528 --> 02:19:03,040
Forever

2488
02:19:03,808 --> 02:19:05,344
And so what

2489
02:19:05,856 --> 02:19:06,368
Eucharist

2490
02:19:06,624 --> 02:19:12,768
Ritual of Christianity

2491
02:19:13,280 --> 02:19:14,304
Vampire

2492
02:19:15,072 --> 02:19:18,912
Which is crazy is it anti-vampire

2493
02:19:19,680 --> 02:19:20,704
No garlic

2494
02:19:20,960 --> 02:19:23,264
Right

2495
02:19:23,520 --> 02:19:24,544
Flash of Christ

2496
02:19:24,800 --> 02:19:28,384
You're misunderstanding what I mean

2497
02:19:30,176 --> 02:19:31,712
His son his consciousness

2498
02:19:33,248 --> 02:19:34,272
Into The Fray

2499
02:19:39,904 --> 02:19:41,696
His children with free conscious will

2500
02:19:58,336 --> 02:19:58,848
Weather

2501
02:20:00,128 --> 02:20:03,200
Fred is a symbol of My Flesh broken for you

2502
02:20:07,040 --> 02:20:08,320
Let's get f***** up

2503
02:20:29,824 --> 02:20:31,104
What

2504
02:20:37,504 --> 02:20:38,016
Need

2505
02:20:38,272 --> 02:20:40,064
Anymore

2506
02:20:47,488 --> 02:20:48,000
Take picture.

2507
02:20:48,512 --> 02:20:49,024
No

2508
02:20:49,280 --> 02:20:55,424
See like I'm not even a little bit

2509
02:20:55,680 --> 02:20:59,520
The universe about transubstantiation

2510
02:20:59,776 --> 02:21:03,104
So I'm agnostic by Nature I don't really know of

2511
02:21:03,360 --> 02:21:04,896
I don't know if any of these

2512
02:21:05,152 --> 02:21:08,224
Mystical things are provable in anyway but if they are

2513
02:21:11,040 --> 02:21:14,624
Has the potential for a lot of experience

2514
02:21:14,880 --> 02:21:21,024
And I'm not one of these hard atheist kind of people

2515
02:21:25,120 --> 02:21:25,632
Said

2516
02:21:25,888 --> 02:21:26,912
My absence

2517
02:21:27,424 --> 02:21:27,936
Like real

2518
02:21:28,192 --> 02:21:28,960
Ineffable not

2519
02:21:30,496 --> 02:21:31,776
The absence of my

2520
02:21:32,032 --> 02:21:32,800
Like strong religious

2521
02:21:33,056 --> 02:21:33,568
Just feeling

2522
02:21:34,080 --> 02:21:35,616
Being stipulated

2523
02:21:35,872 --> 02:21:38,432
I still think that's pretty sensitive to religion

2524
02:21:40,992 --> 02:21:42,784
The wave

2525
02:21:43,040 --> 02:21:44,320
And taking the Eucharist

2526
02:21:44,832 --> 02:21:46,880
Victor Central ritual

2527
02:21:48,160 --> 02:21:50,464
Turning it into something that is satisfying

2528
02:21:50,976 --> 02:21:51,744
Of huge

2529
02:21:52,256 --> 02:21:53,536
Personal Crusade

2530
02:21:53,792 --> 02:21:55,072
His world

2531
02:21:55,328 --> 02:21:57,888
He's created about the globalist vampires

2532
02:21:58,144 --> 02:21:59,168
It's f***** up

2533
02:22:00,192 --> 02:22:01,984
Really really deeply f***** up

2534
02:22:04,032 --> 02:22:06,080
I don't know John.

2535
02:22:06,592 --> 02:22:08,640
Or tail quickly

2536
02:22:08,896 --> 02:22:10,688
This use their words

2537
02:22:10,944 --> 02:22:12,480
In order to reinforce your worldview

2538
02:22:12,736 --> 02:22:14,272
It's a whole f****** another one

2539
02:22:14,784 --> 02:22:16,064
To take the Q source

2540
02:22:17,344 --> 02:22:18,880
The Gospels

2541
02:22:19,392 --> 02:22:20,928
And then repackage them

2542
02:22:21,440 --> 02:22:22,464
For your weird

2543
02:22:23,488 --> 02:22:24,512
Conspiracy theory world

2544
02:22:25,024 --> 02:22:31,168
The Prosperity Gospel from

2545
02:22:32,960 --> 02:22:35,520
David Manning from

2546
02:22:35,776 --> 02:22:40,640
Not that different

2547
02:22:40,896 --> 02:22:42,688
The context of Alex

2548
02:22:44,736 --> 02:22:45,504
People are missed

2549
02:22:45,760 --> 02:22:46,272
Using scripture

2550
02:22:46,784 --> 02:22:47,808
For manipulative

2551
02:22:49,344 --> 02:22:50,112
Profit motive

2552
02:22:50,624 --> 02:22:52,928
Like people like

2553
02:22:53,184 --> 02:22:53,952
Yeah she's the devil

2554
02:22:54,976 --> 02:22:56,768
Like that for sure

2555
02:22:57,792 --> 02:22:58,560
There's something different

2556
02:22:59,328 --> 02:22:59,840
Is the feels like a

2557
02:23:00,352 --> 02:23:01,888
I got bigger page 1

2558
02:23:03,680 --> 02:23:07,264
Seems worse

2559
02:23:07,520 --> 02:23:11,360
Jim Bakker or Paula White Cain in this regard

2560
02:23:11,616 --> 02:23:14,688
Disagree religion

2561
02:23:15,200 --> 02:23:20,064
Because he's transparently full of s*** that is nowhere near the the Bible

2562
02:23:20,320 --> 02:23:21,856
He's he's his Vine

2563
02:23:23,904 --> 02:23:24,672
Is ridiculous

2564
02:23:24,928 --> 02:23:30,560
It's on its face and he doesn't really use

2565
02:23:30,816 --> 02:23:36,960
Also make sure to take the Eucharist because otherwise you'll

2566
02:23:37,216 --> 02:23:43,360
Those guys they're just

2567
02:23:43,872 --> 02:23:44,384
Close enough

2568
02:23:44,896 --> 02:23:46,944
To take something that is meant to be

2569
02:23:48,736 --> 02:23:49,504
I suppose helpful

2570
02:23:49,760 --> 02:23:52,064
And turn it into something that

2571
02:23:52,576 --> 02:23:54,368
Destroys far more people

2572
02:23:54,624 --> 02:23:58,720
It does from a financial perspective

2573
02:23:58,976 --> 02:24:02,816
Hope

2574
02:24:03,072 --> 02:24:03,840
Perspective perhaps

2575
02:24:04,608 --> 02:24:05,632
The reason that I think

2576
02:24:05,888 --> 02:24:08,960
But I single Alex out more is being worse

2577
02:24:11,520 --> 02:24:12,544
Wow he is

2578
02:24:12,800 --> 02:24:13,568
Co-op

2579
02:24:14,080 --> 02:24:15,872
These ideas from scripture

2580
02:24:16,640 --> 02:24:19,200
And turning them into reinforcements of his own

2581
02:24:19,712 --> 02:24:21,504
Within a day before this

2582
02:24:22,016 --> 02:24:24,576
He was using his f*****-up ideas about religion

2583
02:24:24,832 --> 02:24:25,600
Justify

2584
02:24:25,856 --> 02:24:28,416
Maybe your

2585
02:24:28,672 --> 02:24:29,440
One of God's

2586
02:24:29,696 --> 02:24:30,976
Tools of vengeance

2587
02:24:31,232 --> 02:24:32,512
And people need to take

2588
02:24:32,768 --> 02:24:34,816
Confront

2589
02:24:35,072 --> 02:24:35,840
Yeah that's true

2590
02:24:36,864 --> 02:24:40,192
Forcing a worldview that's explicitly being used

2591
02:24:40,448 --> 02:24:41,216
To justify

2592
02:24:42,752 --> 02:24:44,288
Of people that Alex disagrees

2593
02:24:44,800 --> 02:24:46,080
Yeah I don't

2594
02:24:46,336 --> 02:24:49,920
Jim Bakker doing that as much as

2595
02:24:50,176 --> 02:24:51,968
You know I see it is

2596
02:24:52,992 --> 02:24:54,272
The Penguins always there

2597
02:24:55,040 --> 02:24:56,832
Jim Bakker

2598
02:24:59,136 --> 02:25:01,696
So anyway

2599
02:25:01,952 --> 02:25:02,976
I'm left with

2600
02:25:03,232 --> 02:25:04,000
The bitterest

2601
02:25:04,256 --> 02:25:04,768
Taste in my mouth

2602
02:25:05,024 --> 02:25:07,584
I hope

2603
02:25:09,120 --> 02:25:12,448
My feelings are validated as one of the most f*****-up

2604
02:25:12,704 --> 02:25:14,752
Couple days at the show today

2605
02:25:17,824 --> 02:25:18,336
Is that

2606
02:25:18,592 --> 02:25:19,360
Is crazy

2607
02:25:20,128 --> 02:25:20,896
It's understand

2608
02:25:21,152 --> 02:25:26,016
Is embarrassing in hilarious over 2 days

2609
02:25:28,832 --> 02:25:29,856
No or doesn't

2610
02:25:30,112 --> 02:25:31,392
Care that it's totally

2611
02:25:31,648 --> 02:25:32,160
Yeah

2612
02:25:33,440 --> 02:25:34,208
Second

2613
02:25:36,000 --> 02:25:36,768
Through all of this

2614
02:25:37,280 --> 02:25:38,304
Is deeply upsetting

2615
02:25:38,816 --> 02:25:42,144
And it's one of the only times but I'm willing to directly say I

2616
02:25:42,400 --> 02:25:42,912
He should be punished

2617
02:25:43,424 --> 02:25:44,448
Like I really think

2618
02:25:48,032 --> 02:25:49,056
Cooper I legitimately

2619
02:25:50,848 --> 02:25:54,688
I don't know if any of you were a lawyer and you know the law I would like to talk to you

2620
02:25:54,944 --> 02:26:00,832
Could probably hide behind heritage

2621
02:26:01,088 --> 02:26:04,672
Seriously

2622
02:26:04,928 --> 02:26:05,952
Samuraizer

2623
02:26:06,208 --> 02:26:09,792
The late-term abortion of like

2624
02:26:12,096 --> 02:26:14,400
F***** up speech daddy still think I would

2625
02:26:14,912 --> 02:26:17,216
What do you do if you did with Patterson Cooper

2626
02:26:17,472 --> 02:26:18,240
I don't think

2627
02:26:18,496 --> 02:26:19,008
That is okay

2628
02:26:20,544 --> 02:26:21,312
Absolutely

2629
02:26:24,384 --> 02:26:25,664
You know

2630
02:26:26,176 --> 02:26:28,480
If you can't say fire in a crowded theater Etc

2631
02:26:28,736 --> 02:26:30,016
That is

2632

Sing fire

02:26:31,552 --> 02:26:35,136
To 1000 people

02:26:35,648 --> 02:26:36,160
Or shoot

2635
02:26:36,416 --> 02:26:37,696

2638
02:26:44,608 --> 02:26:45,888
Very uncomfortable with it

2639
02:26:46,144 --> 02:26:46,656
I hate to see you

2640
02:26:48,192 --> 02:26:48,704
And I just

2641
02:26:48,960 --> 02:26:49,984
Worry about what if

2642
02:26:50,240 --> 02:26:51,008
Pretends for the

2643
02:26:52,288 --> 02:26:53,312
It doesn't get better

2644
02:26:53,568 --> 02:26:54,592
Yeah

2645
02:26:54,848 --> 02:26:55,616
Deescalate

2646

02:27:04,832 --> 02:27:05,856
Like it's not like he's

2650
02:27:06,368 --> 02:27:07,136
Pressure is going to

2651
02:27:07,392 --> 02:27:08,160
Get off him

2652
02:27:13,024 --> 02:27:15,840

Alex killed his dog

2664
02:27:50,144 --> 02:27:56,288
I don't think his dog ever killed anybody

2665
02:27:56,544 --> 02:27:57,312
Dogs have killed
