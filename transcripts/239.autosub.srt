I'm totally legal I'm fine I do

11
00:00:46,336 --> 00:00:47,360
Bunch of guilt about it

12
00:00:47,872 --> 00:00:50,432
Outside of that I don't know I don't think I've ever direct

13
00:00:50,688 --> 00:00:52,224
Did anybody to commit a crime

14

I've gotten today is about Maria butina

22

Two eyes

00:01:30,112 --> 00:01:35,232
Asra is going to unfold while right now

24
00:01:35,488 --> 00:01:41,632
Hey there's a show where I know a lot about Alex

25
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:43,680
Various

26
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:47,776
That's because I've been

27
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:53,664
Deep in here and I've got interesting modern-day episode alright

28
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,688
December 12th

00:01:54,944 --> 00:02:00,064
I'm 13th episode of The Alex Jones Show

30
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:03,136
There's some really stupid Malik Springs up

31
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:07,744
I would say is it one of the bigger meltdowns at everything from Alex

32
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:08,768
I haven't gone there

33
00:02:09,024 --> 00:02:09,792
On this Earth

34
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:11,584
Alright I'm waiting on that

35
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,376
Real grub

00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:14,144
He

37
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,216
You needed someone like Rob due to hit him with a tranq

38
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:21,312
Dart that's really it's at the level he's getting too

39
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:22,080
Yeah

40
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:28,480
It's real bad but not real bad I was about to make that transition

41
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:31,040
Varsity version of my

42
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:44,864

Jar Jar Binks has a Caribbean

00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,568
Our website

60
00:03:57,824 --> 00:04:01,408
It's knowledge, there's a button on the top of the show

61
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:03,200
Absolute

62
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:04,736
For today

63
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:06,528
Start

64
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:08,832
The 12th which would be Wednesday

65
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:10,112
Show off

66
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:11,648
Little bit of a strange note

67
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:15,488
Reno's from by murdering a prole

68
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:17,791
Strange note

69
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:19,583
Bsharp

70
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:23,935
Paranormal

71
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:27,263
Trump ad

72
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:30,591
Had his little meeting with Pelosi and Schumer

73
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:32,639
They went

74
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:33,919
Where

75
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:34,687
Weather like

76
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:36,479
Shouldn't debate list in front of

77
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:38,783
Ridiculous

78
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:43,135
Alright

79
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:49,023
Very very uncomfortable so I thought that this was going to be something that Alex

80
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:50,303
Which brings up a ton

81
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:51,583
I thought it was going to be

82
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:55,423
Oh and the reason we're starting on Wednesdays because Alex was out of the studio for the

83
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:56,447
Speeding days

84
00:04:58,239 --> 00:04:58,751
Alex

85
00:04:59,263 --> 00:05:00,543
Had gone to Washington

86
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:02,591
Yes even I couldn't

87
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:05,663
He and Rodger Stone went to Washington and

88
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:13,855
Alex Wassabi

89
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:14,879
A proud of himself

90
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:21,023
U-Pull-It price of course he was super proud about that a lot about Trump

91
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:22,047
Pelosi and Schumer

92
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:23,839
At all on the 12th

93
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:28,191
Instead of his main story

94
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:29,727
What did they do anything

95
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:30,751
What do you mean

96
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:32,031
I mean like they went

97
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:34,591
Create a media spectacle.

98
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:36,639
A bunch of rats

99
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:46,111
It's b b sort of

100
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:50,463
Slightly less embarrassing version of Loomer

101
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:51,999
Tying herself to Twitter

102
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:57,887
Why have you been to me

103
00:05:58,399 --> 00:05:59,679
But

104
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:03,519
Ashok throughout the show

105
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:04,287
And there is

106
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:05,311
0 deaths

107
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:06,591
Do it in his reporting

108
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:07,871
It is just one fact

109
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:08,895
But he's throwing

110
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:16,063
Google World Headquarters it's the number to the China is on fire right now

111
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:22,463
Lots.com at newswars.com

112
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:25,535
Large explosion

113
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:30,399
Nope

114
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:33,471
Yesterday

115
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:37,823
New York all sorts of things are going on behind the scenes

116
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:40,383
Obviously the head of Google

117
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:42,431
Sundar

118
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:49,343
Fromage when we were simply pointing out the operation was totally illegal

119
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:51,647
Never brought up

120
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:59,071
Public Enemy Number One

121
00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:01,631
Okay so Google has a building

122
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:02,655
Office

123
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:06,239
Headquarter in China

124
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:09,311
Conditioning unit that apparently caught on fire on the roof

125
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:15,711
First of all that Google has moved their headquarters entirely

126
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:19,551
And then there was an explosion in the building

127
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:22,111
Huge fire

128
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:26,463
Over and over

129
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:32,863
I don't know why that's a repetitive

130
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:45,151
I don't wish fire on Google

131
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:47,455
Crazy his argument

132
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:48,223
That

133
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:48,991
Like

134
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:50,783
Google pull the

135
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:54,623
Baltimore Colts situation in the dead of night all the sudden

136
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:56,159
Moved all of their employees

137
00:07:56,671 --> 00:07:59,231
To China and then the building is just a

138
00:07:59,487 --> 00:08:04,607
Yeah I would say that's one possibility the other possibility is that they've been slow

139
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:10,751
Probably work

140
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:13,055
Alright

141
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:15,103
Either would be like nope

142
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:17,919
Awful as it is

143
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:22,783
The buyer in the Google building

144
00:08:30,207 --> 00:08:35,583
Google

145
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:39,423
The testimony from the earrings

146
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:40,959
They said that it is not

147
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:43,007
Haven't done it

148
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:44,031
But they also

149
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:45,311
Didn't rule out that they might

150
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:50,687
Start working on it already

151
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:51,711
At the same time it's like

152
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:53,503
So if you want to do busy

153
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:54,527
In China

154
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:58,111
You do

155
00:08:58,367 --> 00:09:00,671
It's awful

156
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:01,439
Precedent

157
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:05,023
Certainly

158
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:08,351
Another are explicitly like Google is working

159
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:10,399
With China to Roundup desert

160
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:12,191
Right and as much as you

161
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:15,519
You could save it like the government of China might use the repressive

162
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:16,287
Free speech

163
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:17,055
Rules

164
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:19,359
Father Google be complicit

165
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:22,943
Part that they're helping with rounding up dissonance

166
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:24,735
Make it stretch

167
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:26,271
It's for that but it's not like

168
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:29,087
Google CEO's are out there

169
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:31,903
On horseback

170
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:33,183
The

171
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:39,839
I mean it's like China isn't already doing a great job of that on their own help

172
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:40,607
Cupboard

173
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:45,727
Ninja talking about how everything is going great for the Patriots

174
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:50,079
He's wrong about literally everything

175
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:52,895
Ultramassive news

176
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:54,431
How big is it

177
00:09:54,687 --> 00:10:00,063
Huge that you have macron set tomorrow for a no-confidence vote may be removed from office probably will be

178
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:03,135
No confidence vote today

179
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:05,695
The fall of the New World Order

180
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:11,071
Remember what happened a month ago

181
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:15,679
Merkel's party out of power

182
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:17,727
Didn't happen

183
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:20,287
But now she's a

184
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:21,055
Nope

185
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:27,711
You still there

186
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:33,599
Can I keep listing all this

187
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:34,623
Cool boy

188
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:41,023
Love love that he just throws in Brazil every time he's talking about these awesome situation

189
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:44,607
You know the situation in European politics

190
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:49,727
Germany Angela Merkel was replaced by and a great camp karrenbauer

191
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:55,871
Who has called for the legacy of Angela Merkel

192
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:58,175
While opposing candidate Frederick murders

193
00:10:58,943 --> 00:11:04,831
Democrat

194
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:05,599
Except

195
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:08,159
Angela Merkel is also from that party

196
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:10,463
Crab carrot carrot

197
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:12,767
Karen Bowersox in general but

198
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:15,071
Merkel

199
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:16,863
Merkel get defeated

200
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:19,935
Cheap and Chancellor for 13 years

201
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:20,959
You receive diminished

202
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:22,239
Support in the last election

203
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:23,519
She announced in October

204
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:25,055
That you wouldn't seek re-election

205
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:29,407
In terms of change this is a 0 party becoming chance

206
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:31,455
He said they're going to protect

207
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:33,247
Continuity with merkel's agenda

208
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:36,319
Macron is facing a no-confidence vote in the aftermath

209
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:38,367
To be really dicey yellow vest protest

210
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:40,159
Have been consumed in the country

211
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:42,975
The concern is that he hasn't been effective in handling

212
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:45,535
The vote also

213
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:47,839
This isn't some kind of Auntie globalist maneuver

214
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:52,447
The no-confidence vote is being spearheaded by the French Communist party and the Socialist Party

215
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:56,543
For finally low right now but no serious analyst

216
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:58,079
Is expecting that vote to succeed

217
00:11:58,591 --> 00:12:02,687
Also Theresa May survive the no-confidence vote on when is was an attempt

218
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:03,967
This was not an attempt

219
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:05,503
Teacher as we understand that

220
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:07,039
It was a

221
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:11,135
Tory party MPS to decide whether or not they had confidence in her leadership

222
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:11,903
The party

223
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:14,463
She won the vote 202 117

224
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:15,231
Exhaust

225
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:15,999
Is protected

226
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:18,303
Facing another leadership challenge for a year

227
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:19,583
All of Alex

228
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,631
Examples are not true

229
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:23,679
There's no purging of globalist leaders

230
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:28,543
And even if this were a series of globalist Crusades

231
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:31,359
Paul not produced any of the results

232
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:32,127
Super

233
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:38,783
So much as

234
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:40,319
Yeah alive

235
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:43,647
And with me

236
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:46,463
Understand whenever you was talking about me being part of the

237
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:48,767
Global

238
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:50,559
She's the one leading

239
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:52,095
Brexit liked isn't he

240
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:53,887
Because that's

241
00:12:58,239 --> 00:13:03,359
I literally don't know

242
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:09,247
Yeah

243
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:10,015
Knowing that

244
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:14,879
The same time

245
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:20,767
Who is waiting in the wings

246
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:25,887
Comments after the no-confidence vote even though she

247
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:26,911
She's like this sucks

248
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:29,471
It sucks that a third of my own party dozen

249
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:36,127
But I don't think that excludes

250
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:37,919
In the same way that before Trump

251
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:38,687
Came around

252
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:41,759
He wouldn't have allowed any US president not to be

253
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:49,695
I don't think that he could look at a president or prime minister in the UK that wasn't Nigel farage

254
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:52,255
I think that they are also

255
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:55,071
You know Teresa maze

256
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:59,679
For brexit which is actually doing I'm guessing

257
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:01,983
Acting like she's for brexit

258
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:04,543
But she's really just there to manage

259
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:06,335
Make sure the brexit isn't

260
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:08,639
Heize empty globalist as

261
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:09,407
It could be

262
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:11,199
Actually

263
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:12,479
True though

264
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:17,855
There might be some accurate pieces of it but it's not true

265
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:19,135
I don't think she

266
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:19,903
Really

267
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:25,023
Quote unquote

268
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:25,791
EU

269
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:28,351
Pretty much

270
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:33,471
Results of this is either going to wind up being a hard

271
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:34,495
No Deal brexit

272
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:35,263
Fedora second

273
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:36,031
Referendum

274
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:37,311
Where people are like

275
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:38,335
This was a terrible

276
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:40,639
We want to do over

277
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:42,431
Right button

278
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:48,319
Even this conversation of fanciful ideas of what Alex may or may not believe

279
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:51,391
Black and white

280
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:54,975
Where in the politicians are globalist or they aren't

281
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:57,023
And this really is

282
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:58,815
Part and parcel of Alex's worlds

283
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:05,983
We know that we can't have faith in that

284
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:07,263
But that black and white

285
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:10,591
Really comes in in this next week

286
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:12,895
Important

287
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:16,991
For this country this is the real

288
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:20,575
Decide which side they're on

289
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:21,855
There's only

290
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:28,511
Switzerland

291
00:15:28,767 --> 00:15:31,071
That black-and-white thinking

292
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:34,399
That right there there are only Patriots and globalist

293
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:38,751
There is an appositive

294
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:41,055
That

295
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:43,103
Is how you end up supporting Nazis

296
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:46,943
That is how you end up supporting white nationalist white supremacist

297
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:52,831
Because based on the dichotomy those globalist Ergo they are nationalist

298
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:55,647
Cool awesome human potential people

299
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:58,975
If there is there is only two camps people can begin

300
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:02,559
You are on the side of all people who are

301
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:03,583
Against

302
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:05,631
Globalist

303
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:07,423
Now you got a lot of Nazis

304
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:13,055
Even your Rex and that's how it becomes okay exactly right there is

305
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:15,103
The softest version of radical

306
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:15,871
Elevation

307
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:17,663
Alex

308
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:20,223
Yeah

309
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:23,551
It is

310
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:25,599
Babe I mean

311
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:27,647
Probably as close as possible to

312
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:28,927
The reality of

313
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:30,463
Politico

314
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:37,375
Specifically

315
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:38,911
From the right wing

316
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:41,471
I think Alexis guilty either too

317
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:44,799
Oversimplified categorization in

318
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:46,591
That is one of those

319
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:51,711
Things where you do not like my family

320
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:56,575
I don't agree with all of these things but it's like you're still at

321
00:16:56,831 --> 00:16:58,111
Rally with a lot of nuts

322
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:01,695
I'm at not at a rally with Nazi

323
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:03,231
One of us

324
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:04,255
Is closer tonight

325
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:05,791
You're not or not

326
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:06,559
Yeah

327
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:11,935
But you're awful you know it's just how you become acclimated

328
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:14,239
It's the

329
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:19,615
It's mean it's the worst version of the enemy of my enemy is my friend kind of diet

330
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:22,175
Especially

331
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:22,943
Dichotomy

332
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:23,967
Space song

333
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:24,991
A false

334
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:26,527
Similarity of ideas

335
00:17:28,575 --> 00:17:31,391
People listening to it could easily be tricked into thinking

336
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:35,487
Japan immigrants

337
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:36,767
Coming into the country

338
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:38,047
There

339
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:43,423
Anyway we already sort of touched on this

340
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:48,031
The clip just a second ago

341
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:50,079
But Alex has some more things to say about

342
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:54,687
Did Brazil that stupid

343
00:18:15,423 --> 00:18:17,215
Yikes literally talk

344
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:21,311
Haha yeah oh yeah

345
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:27,199
It's the guy

346
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:30,015
He's a brother

347
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:35,135
Little bit

348
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:36,159
Because

349
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:38,463
His like

350
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:42,047
The new Trump down there kind of thing it really

351
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:45,887
If he knows anything it reveals deeply what he's attracted

352
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:49,727
Big f****** problem

353
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:53,567
Yes so anyway I just

354
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:55,615
Alex lost after Authority

355
00:18:56,127 --> 00:19:01,759
First reaction herbal like by sigala

356
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:02,783
Whoa whoa whoa

357
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:04,063
Trump isn't bolsonaro

358
00:19:04,575 --> 00:19:07,903
You know in your life

359
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:08,927
She's not a

360
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:10,975
Military

361
00:19:11,231 --> 00:19:16,863
Different circumstances in American American history economy

362
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:18,655
Very easily see

363
00:19:18,911 --> 00:19:20,447
The sort of person who puts out

364
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:21,983
Rhetoric in the world

365
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:22,751
The actions that

366
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:23,775
Trump does

367
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:25,823
Exactly that way words

368
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:28,639
In that circumstance

369
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:32,479
Anyway NSX clip Alex screams

370
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:33,759
Rodger Stone

371
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:34,783
Real American

372
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:36,063
The world

373
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:39,903
However

374
00:19:40,415 --> 00:19:43,999
Rodger Stone Alex Jones or Donald Trump jr.

375
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:53,471
Where are the Americans

376
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:04,479
You better understand

377
00:20:06,015 --> 00:20:12,159
Rodger Stone Alex Jones @donaldtrumpjr this

378
00:20:12,415 --> 00:20:13,951
Scream Adam

379
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:20,351
Remember the beginning of episode Maria butina was that she pled guilty to conspiracy

380
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:24,959
United States

381
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:35,199
Are they walking in a straight line because they all have some

382
00:20:35,455 --> 00:20:38,783
Have you ever seen that music video

383
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:41,343
Resetting Rocksteady

384
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:51,071
They did another song called the Heap On Loving You

385
00:20:53,631 --> 00:20:54,655
Is exactly how

386
00:20:54,911 --> 00:21:01,055
I won't go watch that video picture Alex the Rodger Stone and Donald Trump

387
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:03,871
Snapping around like dancing across the

388
00:21:04,127 --> 00:21:05,663
Play side to side on the sidewalk

389
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:12,063
My favorite parts of the show are you explaining anachronistic music by The Whispers are out

390
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:16,672
Hit machine

391
00:21:16,928 --> 00:21:21,024
There's a man on top of that

392
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:24,096
Are twins

393
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:26,400
Crazy mustache

394
00:21:26,656 --> 00:21:28,704
All right I like that

395
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,264
It's real to watch these like these are in

396
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,032
B cigarettes

397
00:21:32,288 --> 00:21:34,080
All in like weird

398
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:34,848
Suits

399
00:21:40,224 --> 00:21:40,992
It's not the same

400
00:21:41,248 --> 00:21:44,064
I drove a sidewalk

401
00:21:45,344 --> 00:21:47,904
I don't know I don't know

402
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:50,720
That

403
00:21:51,232 --> 00:21:53,536
A hundred percent should to end

404
00:21:53,792 --> 00:21:59,936
Should have explored never have

405
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:04,544
I can see you ignore it but the most recent albums

406
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:09,408
I'm sure I should look into them and I will I'll make a commitment to do that but the reason I think

407
00:22:09,664 --> 00:22:10,176
Is it because of like

408
00:22:10,432 --> 00:22:10,944
The groups of

409
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,992
People I was around who were really into them

410
00:22:14,016 --> 00:22:14,528
Maybe

411
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,576
9 years ago

412
00:22:17,088 --> 00:22:20,416
I don't want to possibly really like something

413
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:21,952
Anyway

414
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:27,072
I don't believe Alex Wolff

415
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:28,096
Real America

416
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:30,144
I would like to roll down the window and

417
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:36,288
Also in addition to Pelosi Schumer Trump meeting

418
00:22:37,312 --> 00:22:38,592
Broken here before the

419
00:22:38,848 --> 00:22:40,128
Was that

420
00:22:42,432 --> 00:22:42,944
Descendants 2 3

421
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:46,272
3 years for his his behaviors

422
00:22:54,976 --> 00:22:58,304
Michael Cohen obviously in the last 30 minutes they announced

423
00:23:00,864 --> 00:23:06,752
He's getting three years for congress about Trump Russia Tower

424
00:23:08,032 --> 00:23:11,104
And of course there's nothing

425
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,128
Not this guy

426
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,456
3 years instead of 20 years

427
00:23:15,712 --> 00:23:17,504
$15 money laundering

428
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,040
Stop show

429
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:25,184
Getting fat

430
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,256
What a monstrous little Trader

431
00:23:29,024 --> 00:23:30,304
But a sack of garbage

432
00:23:31,328 --> 00:23:32,352
Michael Cohen is

433
00:23:32,608 --> 00:23:33,120
Cool

434
00:23:33,376 --> 00:23:35,424
I love the like video

435
00:23:39,264 --> 00:23:44,384
Camila who are you at I know that Alex makes the Donald Trump stands for America now so I guess

436
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:48,992
Like betraying him is betraying America

437
00:23:49,248 --> 00:23:51,040
Trader idea comes from

438
00:23:51,552 --> 00:23:53,856
It's going to be so fun in the coming

439
00:23:54,112 --> 00:23:56,672
Like months to speed

440
00:23:56,928 --> 00:24:02,304
That's Bush League stuff reflects for him to make like bending over backwards to be like

441
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:05,888
Yeah Michael Collins Eliza was going to do with Trump

442
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:10,496
Domino's

443
00:24:10,752 --> 00:24:12,032
Feels like they're going to

444
00:24:12,288 --> 00:24:13,568
It's going to be much more difficult

445
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:20,224
His his strolling partner Don juniors

446
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:23,808
That could be

447
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:29,952
Donald Trump jr. was his and bike certificate is that bad on air

448
00:24:34,304 --> 00:24:39,680
No problems about Michael Flynn

449
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:41,472
In a really long time

450
00:24:41,728 --> 00:24:45,056
That is why we used to talk about how he was a super-patriot trying to get

451
00:24:45,312 --> 00:24:50,176
Googling out of the country because gulen was evil and all this stuff

452
00:24:50,688 --> 00:24:51,200
Extradition

453
00:24:53,248 --> 00:24:54,016
Outside the law

454
00:24:54,272 --> 00:25:00,160
And he can talk to her. Thankfully Alex's stop talkin about that so

455
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:01,696
His audience will have forgotten

456
00:25:01,952 --> 00:25:02,464
He was so

457
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,744
Pro Mike Flynn

458
00:25:04,256 --> 00:25:05,280
And he can be like

459
00:25:05,536 --> 00:25:11,680
He was all you was going rogue junior is going to be difficult

460
00:25:12,704 --> 00:25:13,984
He already hates Jared

461
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:15,264
So I don't think that

462
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,056
Going to be a big deal

463
00:25:19,104 --> 00:25:21,664
I'm just trying to picture how you makes his move

464
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,968
Like just an ability after this

465
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,248
I think it's possible

466
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:26,784
I think it is possible

467
00:25:27,808 --> 00:25:28,832
What do you mean

468
00:25:29,088 --> 00:25:30,880
Make your pitch.

469
00:25:31,648 --> 00:25:35,232
Like how do you survive though I would have done it long ago I would have done it already

470
00:25:35,488 --> 00:25:36,256
But

471
00:25:36,512 --> 00:25:38,816
Let me we heard in that last current episode of

472
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:48,288
DUI

473
00:25:48,544 --> 00:25:49,312
Perfect dismount

474
00:25:49,568 --> 00:25:51,360
Really I mean it would involve

475
00:25:51,872 --> 00:25:57,248
Stop by probably severing ties with Rodger Rodger on board with wherever you go in the future

476
00:25:57,504 --> 00:26:03,648
Which is doable I think it's doable and if he stays out of prison

477
00:26:03,904 --> 00:26:08,256
About Roger's going

478
00:26:08,512 --> 00:26:09,280
Super easy

479
00:26:11,328 --> 00:26:13,376
Iic almost

480
00:26:13,888 --> 00:26:15,168
So when it does happen

481
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:17,984
Can use that as a

482
00:26:18,496 --> 00:26:19,264
Jump off point

483
00:26:19,776 --> 00:26:23,104
I don't know what he does from there but probably just goes back to Ron Paul s***

484
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:26,688
He can go again

485
00:26:26,944 --> 00:26:33,088
The one who is lying to me this whole time

486
00:26:33,344 --> 00:26:34,624
The only crime I committed

487
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,416
With loving my country

488
00:26:37,184 --> 00:26:41,792
Jon rappoport sent me emails trying to turn him against me

489
00:26:42,048 --> 00:26:44,352
No one tries to get Rapaport against to me

490
00:26:44,864 --> 00:26:50,240
I don't know if there's a hole there's a whole slew of options

491
00:26:50,496 --> 00:26:52,544
I think it's Alex's smart and you want

492
00:26:53,056 --> 00:26:54,848
You can't be able to continue with rhetoric

493
00:26:55,104 --> 00:26:55,872
Do you have to get off

494
00:26:56,128 --> 00:26:56,640
Yes please

495
00:26:56,896 --> 00:26:59,200
Yeah and that is the perfect way for him to jump off

496
00:26:59,712 --> 00:27:01,760
Because one of the only things that's left

497
00:27:02,272 --> 00:27:02,784
The Trump

498
00:27:04,064 --> 00:27:06,880
And Alex was super into

499
00:27:07,136 --> 00:27:08,416
Was getting out of Master

500
00:27:09,184 --> 00:27:11,744
Yeah any idea that you have this new version

501
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,024
Coming in

502
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:19,424
It undoes all a market is so awesome because of trump

503
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:21,728
Midas kind of gone away

504
00:27:21,984 --> 00:27:23,520
He hasn't put Hillary in prison

505
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:24,800
None of this stuff is happy

506
00:27:25,568 --> 00:27:27,872
All of the people that he put into office that Alex

507
00:27:28,384 --> 00:27:28,896
Said we're going

508
00:27:29,152 --> 00:27:30,432
Going to be amazing like just

509
00:27:30,944 --> 00:27:31,456
Argon

510
00:27:31,712 --> 00:27:32,992
There is nothing left

511
00:27:33,248 --> 00:27:35,296
For him in terms of this dead husk

512
00:27:35,552 --> 00:27:36,576
Of a presidency

513
00:27:36,832 --> 00:27:39,136
For him to make propaganda out of

514
00:27:39,392 --> 00:27:40,672
He needs a fresh start

515
00:27:40,928 --> 00:27:41,696
And that's perfect.

516
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:43,488
Where you can still keep

517
00:27:43,744 --> 00:27:44,768
At least

518
00:27:45,024 --> 00:27:49,888
60% of his audience probably if he doesn't right yeah I think you'll lose some of those diehards and

519
00:27:50,912 --> 00:27:52,704
Three monkeys radicalized too far

520
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:53,984
Will find a new home

521
00:27:58,848 --> 00:28:01,920
I don't think

522
00:28:02,176 --> 00:28:02,944
Has Trump

523
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,992
Actually done anything that Alec

524
00:28:06,528 --> 00:28:07,808
Publicly wanted him to

525
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,112
Yes got out of NAFTA

526
00:28:10,624 --> 00:28:14,720
The TPP EPP

527
00:28:17,792 --> 00:28:23,168
Yeah but that's not really something that Alex

528
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:28,544
Idiosyncrasies

529
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:29,568
Desire

530
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,872
Like has Trump done any of those like

531
00:28:32,896 --> 00:28:36,992
You clearly demonstrated the globe

532
00:28:37,248 --> 00:28:41,088
Indicated a distrust of non-white

533
00:28:42,112 --> 00:28:48,256
I mean the policy of separating families from their children

534
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:49,536
Alex loves that

535
00:28:50,048 --> 00:28:52,096
Globalist

536
00:28:53,888 --> 00:28:59,776
I don't know we're in the weeds back on track not much

537
00:29:00,032 --> 00:29:01,312
I think it's just amazing

538
00:29:02,592 --> 00:29:04,640
You never I don't really consider

539
00:29:05,152 --> 00:29:05,920
Anything

540
00:29:06,688 --> 00:29:07,200
Trump

541
00:29:07,456 --> 00:29:08,480
Has done

542
00:29:09,504 --> 00:29:11,552
Because it is only ever

543
00:29:12,064 --> 00:29:13,088
Specifically benefited

544
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,160
Yeah but you know

545
00:29:17,696 --> 00:29:20,000
But you know what he's done that makes up for so much of that

546
00:29:20,256 --> 00:29:24,352
He at a rally publicly did the idea of being an ass

547
00:29:25,376 --> 00:29:31,520
That means so much to Alex makeup for a multitude of zeros

548
00:29:31,776 --> 00:29:33,312
He is existing on that like

549
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:34,848
That just

550
00:29:35,616 --> 00:29:38,688
I'm starved for three days and then someone gives me bread and I love him

551
00:29:45,088 --> 00:29:46,368
The time in the present because

552
00:29:46,624 --> 00:29:48,160
He's in that position where he's

553
00:29:48,416 --> 00:29:50,208
He's trying so desperately to

554
00:29:54,304 --> 00:29:55,072
Like

555
00:29:55,328 --> 00:29:56,352
I know it.

556
00:29:56,864 --> 00:29:59,936
In this clip he's trying to complain about Mike Pompeo

557
00:30:00,192 --> 00:30:06,336
I don't know why he doesn't explain at all in this clip he gets distracted by

558
00:30:06,592 --> 00:30:11,712
Never gets back on track listen to this b*******

559
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,016
Call Mike Pompeo

560
00:30:15,296 --> 00:30:17,344
Great guy

561
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,392
Mikey p

562
00:30:19,648 --> 00:30:20,416
Is a butt boy

563
00:30:23,744 --> 00:30:24,512
Pretty much

564
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:28,864
Quasi pedophilic

565
00:30:37,568 --> 00:30:43,456
Interested in talking about you now just wants to talk about but

566
00:30:51,648 --> 00:30:56,512
Resolved

567
00:31:07,264 --> 00:31:08,288
Cabin Boy

568
00:31:09,056 --> 00:31:12,640
Well let me tell you I'm SunChips

569
00:31:14,176 --> 00:31:20,320
Okay

570
00:31:21,856 --> 00:31:22,624
We all know that

571
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:26,464
Bugger your children's brains right out Nova

572
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:41,056
Following my mom's from Austin

573
00:31:46,432 --> 00:31:50,272
4

574
00:31:50,528 --> 00:31:53,856
Were some of them but for you

575
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,696
Building a structure

576
00:32:05,376 --> 00:32:07,936
I don't understand

577
00:32:09,216 --> 00:32:14,336
Mike pompeo's but let me tell you about the etymology of but

578
00:32:14,592 --> 00:32:15,616
There was some weird

579
00:32:15,872 --> 00:32:17,920
Central reason I believe often

580
00:32:18,432 --> 00:32:21,504
Talking about leaving Austin for years

581
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:27,904
Even in a 2000

582
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:32,768
I got to get out of this

583
00:32:36,864 --> 00:32:39,168
Really super Bazaar like

584
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:44,544
I'm all here for Alex complaining about how bad it was in the 1700s

585
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:45,312
Sure

586
00:32:45,568 --> 00:32:47,104
All allowed

587
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:49,152
Privateers

588
00:32:49,408 --> 00:32:50,944
We're not good people

589
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:53,248
So point

590
00:32:59,648 --> 00:33:00,160
It's weird

591
00:33:00,928 --> 00:33:03,744
The world that we living in

592
00:33:04,256 --> 00:33:06,560
Like

593
00:33:08,608 --> 00:33:09,120
Television

594
00:33:09,376 --> 00:33:15,520
I don't know about forever

595
00:33:15,776 --> 00:33:16,544
Hey that's a

596
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:22,944
Seriously homophobic slur what are you f****** doing it does feel that way it is

597
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:28,832
That's always been the Pirates

598
00:33:32,416 --> 00:33:34,720
Is not associated with like

599
00:33:35,744 --> 00:33:36,768
NAMBLA

600
00:33:37,024 --> 00:33:37,536
That's just

601
00:33:37,792 --> 00:33:39,584
What people preservative Lee called

602
00:33:40,096 --> 00:33:40,608
Homosexual

603
00:33:42,912 --> 00:33:43,936
Even even in his

604
00:33:44,192 --> 00:33:45,216
Explanation of

00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:58,016
Man

608
00:33:58,272 --> 00:33:59,808
A little bit

609
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:03,648
Alex's the Greeley Riding High on his success of going washing

610
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:06,208
Google CEO

611
00:34:06,464 --> 00:34:07,488
He has a different

612
00:34:08,256 --> 00:34:08,768
Definition

613
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:15,168
This is so stupid

614
00:34:18,752 --> 00:34:20,288
You're going to get the world

615
00:34:21,056 --> 00:34:22,848
Why they fear Infowars

616
00:34:23,616 --> 00:34:24,128
Today

617
00:34:25,152 --> 00:34:25,920
Tilde

618
00:34:26,176 --> 00:34:28,992
Because I

619
00:34:30,016 --> 00:34:34,112
Overall operations bubbles controller 90d

621
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:38,976
Man

622
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:40,768
Palantir

623
00:34:42,304 --> 00:34:48,448
What is Google secret projects like palantir the company was started by Peter teal

00:35:01,504 --> 00:35:03,040
Loud House Radio

626
00:35:03,552 --> 00:35:07,648
I don't know Peter Thiel noted Trump supporter

627
00:35:07,904 --> 00:35:09,184
It was what he started

628
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:09,952
Palin

629
00:35:11,488 --> 00:35:13,536

Deleteriously attacked journalism in

632
00:35:20,448 --> 00:35:21,728
So this is why Alex

633
00:35:21,984 --> 00:35:22,496
Is so

634
00:35:23,008 --> 00:35:23,520
He makes

635
00:35:23,776 --> 00:35:26,080
Google so scared cuz he knows about their secret

636
00:35:26,848 --> 00:35:27,616
Not involved

637
00:35:31,456 --> 00:35:32,992
He's crazy

638
00:35:33,504 --> 00:35:34,272
The palantir

639
00:35:35,296 --> 00:35:41,440

Is a big boy

642
00:35:48,096 --> 00:35:48,608
And

643
00:35:49,888 --> 00:35:50,400
He is there

644
00:35:50,912 --> 00:35:51,424
The fight

645
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:52,448
Against tyranny

646
00:35:52,704 --> 00:35:53,728
In all of its forms

647
00:35:54,752 --> 00:35:57,056
Love evil and you love line

648
00:35:57,312 --> 00:36:00,640
I do Club setting up systems

649
00:36:00,896 --> 00:36:03,456

650
00:36:03,712 --> 00:36:04,992
Altar of God

Eternal

652
00:36:06,784 --> 00:36:09,088
Resistance against every form of tyranny

653
00:36:11,136 --> 00:36:14,720
Also I'm super into what's going on

654
00:36:18,048 --> 00:36:19,584
Brazil

655
00:36:20,096 --> 00:36:23,680
And Philippines

656
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:26,752
Doterra

657
00:36:27,008 --> 00:36:28,032
And

658
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,080
Russia

659
00:36:30,592 --> 00:36:31,104
Killing it

660
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:33,408
All forms of tyranny

661
00:36:33,664 --> 00:36:34,176
From

662
00:36:34,432 --> 00:36:36,224
China specifically

663
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:37,504
That one

664
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:38,272
1

665
00:36:39,296 --> 00:36:40,064
Form of tyranny

666
00:36:42,112 --> 00:36:42,624
But

667
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:47,488
Murderers are empowered by the government

668
00:36:47,744 --> 00:36:50,048
Traditionally kill whomever they just like

669
00:36:50,304 --> 00:36:51,840
No big deal

670
00:36:54,656 --> 00:36:55,680
Alex

671
00:36:55,936 --> 00:36:57,216
Is a

672
00:36:57,472 --> 00:37:03,616
I really need to cover on the 12th I wasn't all that productive a day

673
00:37:03,872 --> 00:37:05,152
For a couple really fun like

674
00:37:05,408 --> 00:37:10,016
A particular have even covered the 12th at all

675
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,576
Because the 13th is

676
00:37:12,832 --> 00:37:14,624
Meet I just like knowing that Alex

677
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:15,648
Henry Google

678
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:18,720
I like knowing

679
00:37:19,232 --> 00:37:22,048
At any point in time Alex could be reading anyone

680
00:37:22,304 --> 00:37:24,096
I'm sitting by the fire

681
00:37:24,352 --> 00:37:26,656
Reading Eggs

682
00:37:27,168 --> 00:37:28,192
Well-worn Kindle

683
00:37:34,848 --> 00:37:35,872
What he dreams about

684
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:37,664
He's late for a tab

685
00:37:39,456 --> 00:37:42,528
We get into the 13th

686
00:37:42,784 --> 00:37:44,576
Here the Thursday episode

687
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:47,648
You know

688
00:37:51,488 --> 00:37:53,792
The news is broken about

689
00:37:54,048 --> 00:37:54,560
Maria butina

690
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:57,888
Thought maybe

691
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,936
Alex is going to

692
00:38:00,448 --> 00:38:02,240
Get into some defensive nest

693
00:38:02,752 --> 00:38:05,312
I was wrong I can't predict Alex's Behavior

694
00:38:05,568 --> 00:38:07,104
Any better than anybody else can

695
00:38:07,616 --> 00:38:08,640
I can I can

696
00:38:09,152 --> 00:38:10,944
Document

697
00:38:11,712 --> 00:38:12,992
But he is so unpredictable

698
00:38:13,504 --> 00:38:15,296
Instead of doing anything

699
00:38:15,552 --> 00:38:17,344
That have to do with the current

700
00:38:18,112 --> 00:38:19,648
He instead launches off

701
00:38:19,904 --> 00:38:20,416
On a

702
00:38:20,672 --> 00:38:21,440
Bucked up

703
00:38:21,952 --> 00:38:23,232
Medical episode

704
00:38:23,744 --> 00:38:28,352
Did what the first hour and a half at least this episode is wall-to-wall ramp

705
00:38:28,608 --> 00:38:29,376
It is

706
00:38:29,632 --> 00:38:30,144
Nothing

707
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,680
Except him just ranting

708
00:38:31,936 --> 00:38:34,240
And here is where he sort of picks up his feet

709
00:38:35,264 --> 00:38:37,312
Everything just in this one article

710
00:38:40,128 --> 00:38:42,176
Bush was here I hadn't seen this article yet

711
00:38:42,944 --> 00:38:44,224
Where do you look for it

712
00:38:44,736 --> 00:38:48,576
What happened other parts of the world lathe imf-world Bank handles at

713
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:51,904
Handles

714
00:38:52,928 --> 00:38:54,464
Documents

715
00:38:55,232 --> 00:38:56,768
American design

716
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:59,584
I just get up here and get

717
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,168
Aesthetically

718
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:06,752
People won't get out dangerous it is and I

719
00:39:07,264 --> 00:39:08,288
Really really angry

720
00:39:08,544 --> 00:39:09,056
Myself

721
00:39:10,592 --> 00:39:12,384
Because if I don't just sarcastically hate

722
00:39:14,944 --> 00:39:16,224
Sorbets

723
00:39:18,016 --> 00:39:18,784
Duet

724
00:39:23,904 --> 00:39:24,416
It's hard

725
00:39:27,232 --> 00:39:29,280
Hard

726
00:39:31,584 --> 00:39:32,864
They're putting polio

727
00:39:33,376 --> 00:39:34,400
In the backseat

728
00:39:38,752 --> 00:39:44,896
First of all unless I snarkily yells that I hate people

729
00:39:49,248 --> 00:39:55,392
Wow that's not good is another another

730
00:39:55,648 --> 00:39:57,440
He probably technically killed a guy

731
00:39:59,232 --> 00:40:03,072
What article he's talking about

732
00:40:04,864 --> 00:40:06,144
You just sort of research

733
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,168
Anything

734
00:40:07,424 --> 00:40:13,568
Anybody in order to get the story about an Indian pharmaceutical company shipping outfit

735
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:14,592
We contaminate

736
00:40:15,872 --> 00:40:18,432
There's problems that story analysis

737
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:24,576
Company the one from

738
00:40:24,832 --> 00:40:30,976
Germany you never know

739
00:40:31,232 --> 00:40:37,376
He might just be pulling that story

740
00:40:45,056 --> 00:40:48,896
The first is that the story broke in late September so it's not technically news

741
00:40:49,408 --> 00:40:53,760
The second is that it was the result not of malice and wanting to give people Pollo

742
00:40:54,016 --> 00:40:56,320
It was the result of faulty Manufacturing

743
00:40:56,576 --> 00:40:59,648
It has been condemned by the US and European regulators

744
00:40:59,904 --> 00:41:00,416
4 years

745
00:41:00,928 --> 00:41:02,720
There's no regulatory oversight

746
00:41:02,976 --> 00:41:04,256
And a lot of the Indian company

747
00:41:04,512 --> 00:41:08,608
People who've gone on record

748
00:41:08,864 --> 00:41:12,192
Infrastructure in place in order to assure quality assurance

749
00:41:12,704 --> 00:41:14,240
That's everything which is why the US

750
00:41:14,752 --> 00:41:16,032
And European authorities

751
00:41:17,312 --> 00:41:18,592
To put out notices of like

752
00:41:18,848 --> 00:41:20,640
Don't use this Indian medicine

753
00:41:21,152 --> 00:41:22,944
Because oftentimes it will be some

754
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:26,784
It is not being produced

755
00:41:27,296 --> 00:41:29,088
Right so then the third problem is

756
00:41:29,344 --> 00:41:31,648
The only people who getting these potentially tainted

757
00:41:31,904 --> 00:41:32,416
Did vaccines

758
00:41:32,672 --> 00:41:33,440
For polio

759
00:41:33,696 --> 00:41:38,304
Where in Maharashtra and uttar Pradesh

760
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:40,864
So no one in the United States or even effect

761
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:41,888
But even though it is still off

762
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:44,192
These people getting potentially tainted

763
00:41:44,448 --> 00:41:45,728
Polio treatment

764
00:41:45,984 --> 00:41:47,520
It is awesome

765
00:41:48,032 --> 00:41:51,104
United States

766
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:52,384
All of the things that I

767
00:41:52,895 --> 00:41:55,199
Ostensibly bringing into this narrative it makes him

768
00:41:55,455 --> 00:41:55,967
Don't you cry

769
00:41:56,223 --> 00:41:57,247
Then murder

770
00:41:57,503 --> 00:41:58,015
It's not real

771
00:41:59,039 --> 00:42:03,903
Go on for now I don't know I still don't know if that's the story he's talking about

772
00:42:04,159 --> 00:42:04,671
But I thought

773
00:42:05,183 --> 00:42:05,695
Close enough

774
00:42:05,951 --> 00:42:07,487
So maybe they talked about

775
00:42:07,743 --> 00:42:09,535
It's also not true

776
00:42:10,047 --> 00:42:10,815
Polio vaccine

777
00:42:11,071 --> 00:42:14,399
Seems or were they some other medicine

778
00:42:14,911 --> 00:42:15,935
So these were like

779
00:42:16,191 --> 00:42:16,703
The old

780
00:42:19,519 --> 00:42:20,287
I seen is whether it's like

781
00:42:20,543 --> 00:42:22,591
Well we put a dead version of the virus

782
00:42:22,847 --> 00:42:24,383
Sentara whatever it is and you build up your

783
00:42:25,407 --> 00:42:30,015
As I understand the articles that I read their investigations that are still ongoing

784
00:42:30,271 --> 00:42:34,623
But the working Theory from what I read was that there was a wrong screen

785
00:42:34,879 --> 00:42:35,903
Napoleon

786
00:42:38,719 --> 00:42:40,767
It's it's the same thing that happened

787
00:42:41,279 --> 00:42:44,351
From time to time you end up with

788
00:42:44,607 --> 00:42:47,167
In countries with no regulatory state

789
00:42:47,423 --> 00:42:48,703
With no

790
00:42:48,959 --> 00:42:49,471
True

791
00:42:49,727 --> 00:42:51,519
There were places where they have no oversight and

792
00:42:51,775 --> 00:42:56,127
End up from time to time just by the law of averages you're going to

793
00:42:56,639 --> 00:42:57,919
You're the wrong thing isn't it

794
00:42:58,175 --> 00:42:59,455
And in terms of Medicine

795
00:42:59,711 --> 00:43:00,735
Really high stakes

796
00:43:01,503 --> 00:43:02,783
So amazing

797
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:05,343
That our quality isn't that great

798
00:43:08,159 --> 00:43:14,303
It's like we don't even have a quality control Department

799
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:15,327
We want to see back Target

800
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:20,959
Some sort of globalization

801
00:43:21,215 --> 00:43:23,007
But have really robots Industries

802
00:43:23,519 --> 00:43:26,335
Like India does have a really large Pharmaceutical

803
00:43:26,591 --> 00:43:27,103
Production

804
00:43:27,871 --> 00:43:29,663
So you at places like that

805
00:43:29,919 --> 00:43:30,687
But they aren't up to

806
00:43:30,943 --> 00:43:31,455
Tubidy

807
00:43:31,711 --> 00:43:32,479
Other

808
00:43:32,991 --> 00:43:33,759
Country

809
00:43:34,271 --> 00:43:35,039
Have established

810
00:43:35,551 --> 00:43:37,087
You're only going to end up with

811
00:43:37,343 --> 00:43:37,855
Lot of

812
00:43:38,111 --> 00:43:38,879
Potential problem

813
00:43:39,391 --> 00:43:41,695
Where is Aether work international regulations

814
00:43:42,719 --> 00:43:45,535
I mean you probably couldn't end up doing something where

815
00:43:46,047 --> 00:43:47,327
If it's produced in Indiana

816
00:43:48,351 --> 00:43:48,863
India

817
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:49,631
You couldn't

818
00:43:49,887 --> 00:43:50,911
Maybe oversee that

819
00:43:51,423 --> 00:43:53,215
In terms of anything that's exported

820
00:43:53,471 --> 00:43:55,263
Those probably are in place already

821
00:43:57,567 --> 00:43:58,079
Kids

822
00:43:58,847 --> 00:43:59,615
Which is still bad

823
00:43:59,871 --> 00:44:00,895
Still waffle

824
00:44:02,175 --> 00:44:07,807
I don't I still don't know if it's even the story we've been shipping them are romaine lettuce

825
00:44:08,575 --> 00:44:09,087
So I'm sure they'll

826
00:44:09,855 --> 00:44:12,159
I don't know but Alex

827
00:44:12,415 --> 00:44:14,207
Talk more about it and gets even more so

828
00:44:22,143 --> 00:44:23,423
Shots

829
00:44:28,031 --> 00:44:34,175
Do you understand

830
00:44:34,431 --> 00:44:40,575
The children

831
00:44:40,831 --> 00:44:42,367
Sibley cover that up

832
00:44:42,623 --> 00:44:43,903
I don't think you could

833
00:44:44,159 --> 00:44:47,231
Not possible now

834
00:44:47,487 --> 00:44:47,999
Sort of

835
00:44:48,511 --> 00:44:51,583
Closed in the scope of what he's talking about

836
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:52,351
Pet store

837
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:56,191
Although maybe he would try and use that later to bolster whatever

838
00:44:56,447 --> 00:44:57,215
Story start

839
00:44:57,471 --> 00:44:59,263
But I still don't know what article you talk

840
00:44:59,775 --> 00:45:01,055
Nothing

841
00:45:01,311 --> 00:45:02,335
To go on except gases

842
00:45:02,847 --> 00:45:03,871
So I looked around

843
00:45:04,127 --> 00:45:07,199
December 10th article on ABC

844
00:45:07,455 --> 00:45:08,991
But a new mysterious disease

845
00:45:10,015 --> 00:45:12,319
That is in some cases paralyzing children

846
00:45:13,087 --> 00:45:14,111
According to the article quote

847
00:45:14,367 --> 00:45:18,975
Investigators of the current outbreak have ruled out polio finding no evidence of that virus

848
00:45:19,487 --> 00:45:19,999
Some cases

849
00:45:20,255 --> 00:45:23,583
So it's something to present similarly to polio but absolutely isn't

850
00:45:24,607 --> 00:45:26,911
At no point like I said does Alex Best Buy with articles

851
00:45:27,167 --> 00:45:29,471
Responding to

852
00:45:29,983 --> 00:45:32,543
I mean it seems it seems pretty close to his second

853
00:45:32,799 --> 00:45:35,103
By refining of the brethren

854
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:36,895
This isn't about polio

855
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:39,711
It's about a condition called acute flaccid myelitis

856
00:45:40,223 --> 00:45:40,735
Which is

857
00:45:40,991 --> 00:45:42,015
Is norovirus

858
00:45:42,271 --> 00:45:43,551
Which folio is as well

859
00:45:44,063 --> 00:45:46,111
They're over a hundred other enterovirus

860
00:45:46,367 --> 00:45:48,159
Is it or not polio that exist

861
00:45:48,671 --> 00:45:49,951
Most of these aren't very serious

862
00:45:50,207 --> 00:45:50,975
Be treated very effective

863
00:45:51,743 --> 00:45:55,071
As is the case with many diseases the severity of the cases of AMF

864
00:45:55,583 --> 00:45:59,423
Depends largely on detection and on the doctor is being able to treat the condition

865
00:45:59,935 --> 00:46:03,263
All Alex is doing by making making people distrustful of doctors here which

866
00:46:03,519 --> 00:46:04,031
What he's doing

867
00:46:04,287 --> 00:46:07,359
I was just making sure that people don't get appropriate treatment in time

868
00:46:07,871 --> 00:46:08,639
Also

869
00:46:08,895 --> 00:46:10,175
This isn't caused by vaccine

870
00:46:11,455 --> 00:46:12,991
Illogical complication

871
00:46:13,247 --> 00:46:15,039
After Eva 71

872
00:46:15,295 --> 00:46:17,599
Infection that's what doctors are speculating

873
00:46:17,855 --> 00:46:18,367
Is what

874
00:46:18,623 --> 00:46:19,135
Precipitate

875
00:46:19,391 --> 00:46:21,183
Dai Asm

876
00:46:21,439 --> 00:46:22,719
Are so rare

877
00:46:22,975 --> 00:46:24,255
Vaccine is not war

878
00:46:24,767 --> 00:46:29,887
Dr. Vincent racaniello PhD professor of the Department of microbiology

879
00:46:30,399 --> 00:46:31,679
Immunology Columbia University

880
00:46:32,447 --> 00:46:37,311
Quote remember the poliovirus used to paralyze tens of thousands of children in United States

881
00:46:37,567 --> 00:46:38,079
Which was

882
00:46:44,479 --> 00:46:45,759
Whatever this is called

883
00:46:46,015 --> 00:46:47,807
This is something that we don't

884
00:46:48,063 --> 00:46:51,135
It's so rare that we don't treat with a vax

885
00:46:51,391 --> 00:46:52,159
Speaking for it

886
00:46:52,415 --> 00:46:53,183
So

887
00:46:53,439 --> 00:46:53,951
The ideas

888
00:46:54,207 --> 00:46:55,487
The vaccines precipitating

889
00:46:55,743 --> 00:46:56,255
This is nonsense

890
00:46:56,511 --> 00:46:57,279
And it's not

891
00:46:58,047 --> 00:46:58,815
If something else

892
00:46:59,327 --> 00:47:01,375
Presumably aiasf

893
00:47:02,399 --> 00:47:05,471
Unfolding

894
00:47:05,727 --> 00:47:07,007
Current doctors are still

895
00:47:07,263 --> 00:47:10,335
A little bit up in the air about it but it's also not tens of thousands

896
00:47:10,591 --> 00:47:12,127
It's not killing most

897
00:47:13,151 --> 00:47:13,919
A lot of them have

898
00:47:14,175 --> 00:47:16,735
Fairly minor reactions to it but

899
00:47:17,759 --> 00:47:18,783
Call Sprouts

900
00:47:21,087 --> 00:47:22,623
Minimize or

901
00:47:23,391 --> 00:47:25,183
By the way Alex is using

902
00:47:30,303 --> 00:47:31,839
King Salman

903
00:47:32,095 --> 00:47:34,143
Closest

904
00:47:34,399 --> 00:47:34,911
Super Tucson

905
00:47:35,167 --> 00:47:36,447
Actually

906
00:47:36,703 --> 00:47:37,215
Make people

907
00:47:37,471 --> 00:47:38,239
Less likely

908
00:47:38,495 --> 00:47:39,519
Me to take care of

909
00:47:40,287 --> 00:47:41,823
Because quite frankly

910
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:42,847
This is super important

911
00:47:43,103 --> 00:47:44,383
There is no cure for polio

912
00:47:44,895 --> 00:47:45,407
There isn't one

913
00:47:45,919 --> 00:47:47,967
The only thing you can do about it is

914
00:47:48,735 --> 00:47:49,247
Get a vaccine

915
00:47:49,759 --> 00:47:50,271
Does only prevent

916
00:47:50,783 --> 00:47:54,623
Since 1988 ninety-nine percent drop in cases of polio

917
00:47:54,879 --> 00:47:56,671
Since we started work.

918
00:47:57,183 --> 00:48:00,767
Before then there was 350,000 children coming down with it annually

919
00:48:01,023 --> 00:48:02,815
And this year there were 27

920
00:48:03,327 --> 00:48:05,631
Whatever conspiratorial nonsense Alex paddling

921
00:48:06,399 --> 00:48:06,911
Nothing

922
00:48:07,167 --> 00:48:11,007
Close to the scientific validity of that level of result

923
00:48:11,263 --> 00:48:12,287
Everybody

924
00:48:12,543 --> 00:48:13,055
Has

925
00:48:13,311 --> 00:48:13,823
Autism

926
00:48:14,847 --> 00:48:17,407
That everyone in the world

927
00:48:17,663 --> 00:48:19,455
Because if they if we

928
00:48:19,711 --> 00:48:21,247
How many hundreds of thousands

929
00:48:21,503 --> 00:48:25,343
Millions upon Millions

930
00:48:25,855 --> 00:48:26,623
I assume

931
00:48:26,879 --> 00:48:27,903
I mean through the used

932
00:48:28,159 --> 00:48:29,951
The vaccine assumed everybody

933
00:48:30,207 --> 00:48:30,719
Has autism

934
00:48:30,975 --> 00:48:32,511
It's a wonder One

935
00:48:32,767 --> 00:48:35,839
Resurgence of measles

936
00:48:36,095 --> 00:48:37,375
Which it becomes

937
00:48:38,399 --> 00:48:39,423
Vaccinations for it

938
00:48:39,935 --> 00:48:45,823
Doctors are currently warnings that we are facing the very real possibility that we'll see the same thing with Pollo in the coming years

939
00:48:46,335 --> 00:48:46,847
Cuz again

940
00:48:47,103 --> 00:48:48,383
There is no cure for polio

941
00:48:48,895 --> 00:48:49,919
The only way to handle it

942
00:48:50,175 --> 00:48:51,199
Is there prevention with the vaccine

943
00:48:51,711 --> 00:48:53,247
Creating fear B vaccine

944
00:48:53,759 --> 00:48:54,783
Affecting the general

945
00:48:55,039 --> 00:48:56,575
He's really good for Alex's business

946
00:48:57,087 --> 00:48:57,855
But ultimately

947
00:48:58,111 --> 00:48:58,879
If more people listen to

948
00:48:59,135 --> 00:49:00,159
Yeah man act on his advice

949
00:49:00,671 --> 00:49:01,695
It's going to leave

950
00:49:02,719 --> 00:49:03,487
Polio

951
00:49:03,743 --> 00:49:04,511
Real bad one

952
00:49:05,023 --> 00:49:06,047
Because people can get it

953
00:49:06,303 --> 00:49:07,071
Pretty easily

954
00:49:07,327 --> 00:49:09,375
And the severity

955
00:49:10,655 --> 00:49:11,679
Is very high

956
00:49:12,959 --> 00:49:14,495
So this is really

957
00:49:15,007 --> 00:49:18,335
I hate the things that I hate most about this

958
00:49:18,591 --> 00:49:20,639
Whole bulshit that he's on right now

959
00:49:20,895 --> 00:49:21,407
Is that

960
00:49:21,663 --> 00:49:23,455
There is a real world

961
00:49:23,711 --> 00:49:24,223
Corollary

962
00:49:24,991 --> 00:49:26,015
That is

963
00:49:28,063 --> 00:49:31,647
Jump in there with just move a couple of words around and you're talking about

964
00:49:32,415 --> 00:49:32,927
Like

965
00:49:33,183 --> 00:49:35,743
The government is poisoning our water

966
00:49:36,255 --> 00:49:37,023
F******

967
00:49:37,279 --> 00:49:38,559
They're killing children

968
00:49:38,815 --> 00:49:42,655
A disease that we have

969
00:49:42,911 --> 00:49:45,215
They're doing all of that

970
00:49:45,471 --> 00:49:46,239
Alex just

971
00:49:46,495 --> 00:49:49,311
Just change the narrative it doesn't have to

972
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:53,407
All you have to do you could

973
00:49:53,663 --> 00:49:54,687
Alex producer

974
00:49:54,943 --> 00:49:55,711
Real good

975
00:49:58,783 --> 00:49:59,807
Michigan

976
00:50:00,575 --> 00:50:05,951
Yeah I know polio outbreak real

977
00:50:06,207 --> 00:50:06,719
Government

978
00:50:07,231 --> 00:50:08,255
F****** disease

979
00:50:08,767 --> 00:50:09,535
It kind of does suck

980
00:50:10,047 --> 00:50:10,559
I mean

981
00:50:11,071 --> 00:50:12,351
He would probably agree

982
00:50:12,863 --> 00:50:13,887
On the point

983
00:50:14,143 --> 00:50:15,423
But he just doesn't care to ever

984
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:16,703
Talk about it

985
00:50:18,751 --> 00:50:20,287
Alex

986
00:50:20,543 --> 00:50:22,079
Talk more about this

987
00:50:22,591 --> 00:50:23,615
I have to go on it

988
00:50:23,871 --> 00:50:24,639
Clearly

989
00:50:25,407 --> 00:50:26,943
The best context clues I can

990
00:50:27,199 --> 00:50:27,711
Confined

991
00:50:37,183 --> 00:50:43,327
American World

992
00:50:43,583 --> 00:50:49,215
3 million +

993
00:50:50,751 --> 00:50:55,615
Heartbroke with Baltimore are playing there

994
00:50:55,871 --> 00:50:58,175
That's why they love murdering people so much

995
00:50:58,431 --> 00:51:01,503
I mean we went over that factor 8 story on recent

996
00:51:01,759 --> 00:51:03,039
Episode

997
00:51:03,551 --> 00:51:05,855
I don't know I lose track of time

998
00:51:09,695 --> 00:51:10,719
Of American history

999
00:51:12,255 --> 00:51:18,399
Fault

1000
00:51:18,655 --> 00:51:20,191
That would involve

1001
00:51:20,447 --> 00:51:21,471
But also

1002
00:51:21,727 --> 00:51:23,007
Creative atmosphere

1003
00:51:23,263 --> 00:51:23,775
Stigma

1004
00:51:24,031 --> 00:51:24,799
About

1005
00:51:25,311 --> 00:51:26,079
HIV and AIDS

1006
00:51:26,335 --> 00:51:26,847
That

1007
00:51:27,103 --> 00:51:28,127
And

1008
00:51:28,383 --> 00:51:29,663
Just taboo and not.

1009
00:51:30,175 --> 00:51:33,503
And absolutely could not have given less of a f*** when it wasn't it

1010
00:51:34,783 --> 00:51:36,831
Clip

1011
00:51:37,087 --> 00:51:38,879
About the vaccine stuff

1012
00:51:39,135 --> 00:51:41,439
And in this Alex's to warn people

1013
00:51:41,695 --> 00:51:43,487
That your kids are going to get vaccines

1014
00:51:43,743 --> 00:51:44,255
Without you

1015
00:51:44,511 --> 00:51:45,023
Consent

1016
00:51:45,279 --> 00:51:46,559
Which is very

1017
00:51:53,727 --> 00:51:54,239
There

1018
00:51:56,799 --> 00:51:58,591
Checks California

1019
00:52:01,151 --> 00:52:03,967
Dollar free debit card

1020
00:52:08,831 --> 00:52:10,111
California

1021
00:52:18,303 --> 00:52:20,351
We have

1022
00:52:22,655 --> 00:52:26,239
Add pivot but yeah.

1023
00:52:26,495 --> 00:52:32,639
That will give them polio because the globalist are offering them $200 to get you won't be able to choose

1024
00:52:39,039 --> 00:52:40,063
Big news

1025
00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:45,183
I finally solved the mystery that has been plaguing me since we started this podcast

1026
00:52:45,695 --> 00:52:47,999
I will be talking about it on the episode next week

1027
00:52:48,511 --> 00:52:53,375
It is the mystery of why does Alex Jones on the website Arnold exposed.com

1028
00:52:54,399 --> 00:52:56,447
I finally solved the mystery

1029
00:52:58,751 --> 00:53:02,847
Yes look at The Hardy Boys into this one what happened there

1030
00:53:03,103 --> 00:53:03,615
No

1031
00:53:03,871 --> 00:53:04,383
And I don't want

1032
00:53:05,407 --> 00:53:07,199
It's a wild story

1033
00:53:07,455 --> 00:53:12,319
Search on people

1034
00:53:12,575 --> 00:53:14,367
Infowars Prison Planet

1035
00:53:14,623 --> 00:53:17,439
Report Arnold exposed

1036
00:53:18,719 --> 00:53:19,231
Why you left

1037
00:53:19,743 --> 00:53:20,767
Does Alex running and

1038
00:53:21,023 --> 00:53:22,815
Anti Arnold Schwarzenegger

1039
00:53:23,327 --> 00:53:29,471
It's not just the domain websites that up about Arnold Schwarzenegger

1040
00:53:32,799 --> 00:53:34,079
No

1041
00:53:34,591 --> 00:53:36,127
Alex

1042
00:53:43,295 --> 00:53:47,391
We're done with the vaccine stuff for now and I get teased at the

1043
00:53:47,647 --> 00:53:48,671
This episode

1044
00:53:49,183 --> 00:53:50,975
Alex has a complete freak out

1045
00:53:51,231 --> 00:53:52,767
Breakdown on air

1046
00:53:53,023 --> 00:53:56,607
Coming and it wasn't him saying I'm going to cry and that I'm going to kill people

1047
00:53:56,863 --> 00:53:58,655
I feel like that is the beginning of a great room

1048
00:54:01,215 --> 00:54:03,519
The episode when he comes in with that

1049
00:54:03,775 --> 00:54:04,799
You knows it's like

1050
00:54:05,055 --> 00:54:08,383
It's to make it to our 3 without losing it

1051
00:54:08,639 --> 00:54:10,943
Maddie loses at heart but before he does

1052
00:54:11,967 --> 00:54:14,527
He said something that he probably one of the most grandiose ping

1053
00:54:14,783 --> 00:54:15,551
The person can say

1054
00:54:16,063 --> 00:54:19,391
And clothes

1055
00:54:19,647 --> 00:54:20,159
Very close

1056
00:54:23,487 --> 00:54:26,303
Kick-off one another and pick off another

1057
00:54:26,559 --> 00:54:29,119
Hearing about it and you

1058
00:54:29,375 --> 00:54:30,143
Adapt

1059
00:54:36,287 --> 00:54:37,823
Organizers

1060
00:54:38,079 --> 00:54:39,359
Pictures of program

1061
00:54:40,639 --> 00:54:46,783
But they looked at the actuaries triggered human survival Instinct

1062
00:54:49,599 --> 00:54:51,391
Because of my particular plan

1063
00:54:55,231 --> 00:54:55,999
Lead the Titans

1064
00:54:56,255 --> 00:54:56,767
Force

1065
00:54:59,071 --> 00:55:01,119
Pure micro

1066
00:55:01,375 --> 00:55:02,911
That will defeat the enemy

1067
00:55:11,359 --> 00:55:14,175
Blown major Holzman operations before

1068
00:55:16,991 --> 00:55:17,503
How

1069
00:55:21,855 --> 00:55:26,207
I got to get their program

1070
00:55:26,719 --> 00:55:27,231
So

1071
00:55:27,743 --> 00:55:30,815
Okay

1072
00:55:31,071 --> 00:55:32,863
Man what he is expressing

1073
00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:33,631
Is

1074
00:55:33,887 --> 00:55:36,703
The reason they kicked me off Facebook and Twitter and all this

1075
00:55:36,959 --> 00:55:37,983
It's because they

1076
00:55:38,239 --> 00:55:39,007
The globalist

1077
00:55:39,263 --> 00:55:40,799
Have actuaries

1078
00:55:41,055 --> 00:55:46,687
Number crunching and figured out that Alex Jones is break which is lying

1079
00:55:46,943 --> 00:55:47,967
Is the only thing

1080
00:55:49,247 --> 00:55:54,367
Wake up and save Humanity it's kicked in the survival response of humanity that is

1081
00:55:54,623 --> 00:55:55,903
Migrant narcissism

1082
00:55:56,159 --> 00:55:58,719
I also don't know what that means

1083
00:55:59,231 --> 00:56:03,583
Right before the clip

1084
00:56:03,839 --> 00:56:06,655
I am your God have the ability

1085
00:56:07,167 --> 00:56:07,935
I'm one of the only people

1086
00:56:08,959 --> 00:56:09,471
Brandon

1087
00:56:12,287 --> 00:56:15,615
Able to do is wake you up out of your slumber

1088
00:56:15,871 --> 00:56:17,663
Remind you that you need to survive

1089
00:56:18,687 --> 00:56:20,223
That is

1090
00:56:20,479 --> 00:56:20,991
Deeply

1091
00:56:21,247 --> 00:56:22,271
Deeply f*****-up

1092
00:56:23,807 --> 00:56:25,343

That vetted there's like a

1095
00:56:29,951 --> 00:56:30,975
Psychological term for that

1096
00:56:31,231 --> 00:56:33,023
Something along the lines of malignant

1097
00:56:33,791 --> 00:56:37,119
Call you sound like

1098
00:56:40,703 --> 00:56:41,215
Touch

1099
00:56:43,775 --> 00:56:45,823
That's just Ed McMahon

1100
00:56:47,615 --> 00:56:49,407
Titan

1101
00:56:49,919 --> 00:56:55,551
The old Star Search

1102
00:56:56,063 --> 00:56:57,343
Little girl

Goodbye

1107
00:57:12,959 --> 00:57:18,079
Didn't mean to be dismissive of you and Ed McMahon at the same time

1108
00:57:18,591 --> 00:57:23,455
No I wasn't even saying literally you sound like his Xbox

1109
00:57:27,551 --> 00:57:28,063
Deeply

1110
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:29,343
Deeply flawed

1111
00:57:30,367 --> 00:57:32,415
Understanding of the history of a

1112
00:57:33,695 --> 00:57:34,207
Men's orca

1113
00:57:34,463 --> 00:57:34,975
Innovation

1114
00:57:35,231 --> 00:57:35,999
In America

1115
00:57:36,767 --> 00:57:38,047
B

1116
00:57:38,303 --> 00:57:42,655
Nope. But the truth of it is

1117
00:57:43,679 --> 00:57:45,215
And then the reality behind it

1118
00:57:45,727 --> 00:57:46,495
Even more f***** up

1119
00:57:47,007 --> 00:57:47,775
Get ready for a ride

1120
00:57:50,335 --> 00:57:52,895
5 years ago when they said we're going to have

1121
00:57:55,199 --> 00:57:58,527
Gay Scout leaders

1122
00:57:58,783 --> 00:57:59,807
Sounds like you are

1123
00:58:00,063 --> 00:58:05,951
What does vice versa mean

1124
00:58:13,631 --> 00:58:16,447
Murray

1125
00:58:22,335 --> 00:58:26,943
Happy freaking broseph solo balloons

Is jet

1129
00:59:20,959 --> 00:59:25,823

00:59:29,151 --> 00:59:32,735
How's the weather

1132
00:59:32,991 --> 00:59:36,831
Looking like bowls apparel

1133
00:59:38,367 --> 00:59:43,487
It's almost like he has bathrooms trying to work against them.

1134
00:59:46,303 --> 00:59:47,839
Incredibly stupid for a number

1135
00:59:49,119 --> 00:59:50,399
The first of the Boy Scouts

1136
00:59:50,655 --> 00:59:51,167
Handout

1137
00:59:51,423 --> 00:59:54,239
Condoms there just available for people at the house centers

1138
00:59:54,495 --> 00:59:55,007
Is there a part of the

1139
00:59:55,263 --> 00:59:57,311
Event event

1140
01:00:01,407 --> 01:00:04,735
Available at Scout Jamboree

1141
01:00:06,271 --> 01:00:08,831
They didn't allow homosexual Scout leaders until 2000

1142
01:00:09,087 --> 01:00:09,599
13

1143
01:00:10,367 --> 01:00:10,879
Thirdly

1144
01:00:11,903 --> 01:00:13,183
Probably more important

1145
01:00:13,951 --> 01:00:15,487
The sexual abuse lawsuits that are potential

1146
01:00:15,743 --> 01:00:19,583
We going to result in the Boy Scouts filing for bankruptcy

1147
01:00:22,143 --> 01:00:24,191
Back here

1148
01:00:25,727 --> 01:00:28,543
The group was negligent in allowing a sex offender to be

1149
01:00:30,591 --> 01:00:31,103
Screw

1150
01:00:31,359 --> 01:00:33,663
All these acts happened between 1981

1151
01:00:33,919 --> 01:00:34,431
188

1152
01:00:34,687 --> 01:00:36,223
And have to do with Thomas

1153
01:00:36,735 --> 01:00:39,295
Who's arrested for molesting children

1154
01:00:39,551 --> 01:00:40,831
In 1961

1155
01:00:41,087 --> 01:00:42,879
Then allowed to join other troops at

1156
01:00:43,135 --> 01:00:43,647
After the fact

1157
01:00:43,903 --> 01:00:47,231
So there's a group of scouts because of that

1158
01:00:47,487 --> 01:00:49,023
And they were negligent for having

1159
01:00:50,815 --> 01:00:51,327
Call

1160
01:00:51,583 --> 01:00:52,607
To Noah

1161
01:00:53,887 --> 01:00:55,679
Children

1162
01:00:55,935 --> 01:00:56,959
And they allowed him

1163
01:00:57,215 --> 01:00:57,727
How to be a scout leader

1164
01:00:58,239 --> 01:01:02,079
In addition does another lawsuit wear for men are suing the boy scouts over abuse that happened

1165
01:01:02,335 --> 01:01:03,103
Between 19/7

1166
01:01:03,359 --> 01:01:04,639
Before the 1970s

1167
01:01:05,407 --> 01:01:08,735
They're a lot more current instances of abuse in the Boy Scouts

1168
01:01:08,991 --> 01:01:12,063
But the major lawsuits that they're facing right now have to do with the vents

1169
01:01:12,319 --> 01:01:14,111
From decades ago before there were condoms

1170
01:01:14,367 --> 01:01:15,647
And before gays were welcome

1171
01:01:16,159 --> 01:01:17,951
Nothing but Alex is doing here is real

1172
01:01:18,207 --> 01:01:20,511
He's just demonizing both Sexual Health practices

1173
01:01:20,767 --> 01:01:23,071
And the lgbtq community by connecting them to

1174
01:01:23,327 --> 01:01:24,607
Completely unrelated issue

1175
01:01:24,863 --> 01:01:26,911
Of sexual predators unfortunately

1176
01:01:27,167 --> 01:01:28,191
Probably accurately

1177
01:01:28,447 --> 01:01:29,983
Seen the Boy Scouts as a place where they can

1178
01:01:30,239 --> 01:01:30,751
Easley fine

1179
01:01:32,031 --> 01:01:33,823
And unfortunately and doing the research for this

1180
01:01:34,335 --> 01:01:35,359
We don't need to get into

1181
01:01:36,639 --> 01:01:37,919
Arrow locks

1182
01:01:38,431 --> 01:01:40,735
Of instances of abuse

1183
01:01:43,039 --> 01:01:43,551
There are

1184
01:01:46,367 --> 01:01:46,879
Chicken plate that

1185
01:01:47,135 --> 01:01:48,671
Into some sort of

1186
01:01:49,695 --> 01:01:51,999
Condoms being available thing is complete.

1187
01:01:53,023 --> 01:01:53,791
It's sewing

1188
01:01:54,047 --> 01:01:56,095
Infuriating whenever that line of

1189
01:01:56,607 --> 01:01:58,143
Bulshit shows up

1190
01:01:58,399 --> 01:02:04,543
Every single time I bring them up because I'm talking

1191
01:02:04,799 --> 01:02:07,103
Think about pedophilia yeah and also

1192
01:02:07,871 --> 01:02:11,455
I don't have a problem with men who like men or vice versa is that

1193
01:02:11,711 --> 01:02:17,855
Mike's adventure

1194
01:02:19,391 --> 01:02:25,535
Vice versa

1195
01:02:29,887 --> 01:02:33,471
It's gross it's so gross

1196
01:02:33,727 --> 01:02:35,519
It's f****** awful and it's it's

1197
01:02:36,799 --> 01:02:38,847
Just like that b******* like

1198
01:02:39,103 --> 01:02:42,175
Oh I don't want a trans

1199
01:02:42,687 --> 01:02:46,527
Woman using the women's bathroom

1200
01:02:46,783 --> 01:02:48,063
They're going to attack my kid

1201
01:02:48,831 --> 01:02:50,367
Transport

1202
01:02:50,623 --> 01:02:52,159
Every single

1203
01:02:52,415 --> 01:02:57,791
Oh I don't want I don't want these kids to go to this place where they're homosexual

1204
01:02:58,559 --> 01:02:59,839
Youth group leaders

1205
01:03:00,095 --> 01:03:01,375
Molest more children

1206
01:03:01,631 --> 01:03:07,775
Anything like that I'm glad that we're finally all on board with the

1207
01:03:08,031 --> 01:03:10,847
Catholic Church

1208
01:03:11,103 --> 01:03:12,383
Pedophilia

1209
01:03:13,151 --> 01:03:14,431
Really this is crazy

1210
01:03:14,687 --> 01:03:15,967
The problem in the Catholic Church

1211
01:03:16,223 --> 01:03:19,551
Exist without them allowing gay

1212
01:03:20,063 --> 01:03:21,087
I'm not sure

1213
01:03:21,343 --> 01:03:22,111
They do now I don't

1214
01:03:22,367 --> 01:03:26,463
We can practice their rule

1215
01:03:26,975 --> 01:03:29,791
The issue exists without them supporting condoms

1216
01:03:32,095 --> 01:03:33,631
Just trying to present as being important

1217
01:03:33,887 --> 01:03:35,679
In the Boy Scout abuse history

1218
01:03:35,935 --> 01:03:37,983
It clearly isn't relevant in the fact that he

1219
01:03:38,239 --> 01:03:38,751
Brings up this

1220
01:03:39,775 --> 01:03:40,799
Catholic Church

1221
01:03:41,055 --> 01:03:41,823
As like soda

1222
01:03:42,079 --> 01:03:42,847
Does parallel thing

1223
01:03:43,359 --> 01:03:44,127
The element

1224
01:03:44,639 --> 01:03:45,151
He's trying to use

1225
01:03:45,407 --> 01:03:46,175
To connect to them don't

1226
01:03:46,943 --> 01:03:47,455
Inference

1227
01:03:48,479 --> 01:03:49,247
Complete

1228
01:03:57,695 --> 01:04:03,583
I did not know that crazy early for them to Beyond on that tip

1229
01:04:03,839 --> 01:04:05,375
Well because there are adults

1230
01:04:05,631 --> 01:04:08,191
There and also because some of the kids are of

1231
01:04:11,775 --> 01:04:17,919
Is legal I can't wipe

1232
01:04:18,175 --> 01:04:21,247
Boy Scouts

1233
01:04:22,015 --> 01:04:25,087
Hello by

1234
01:04:26,367 --> 01:04:27,391
World Health

1235
01:04:28,159 --> 01:04:33,535
And they got on board with it I don't know

1236
01:04:34,303 --> 01:04:35,071
Very interesting

1237
01:04:36,095 --> 01:04:37,887
Maybe I would have

1238
01:04:38,143 --> 01:04:44,287
We do whole episode about the discount being on Sexual Health early tip

1239
01:04:46,079 --> 01:04:51,711
Definitely early

1240
01:04:52,735 --> 01:04:53,247
Personally

1241
01:04:53,759 --> 01:04:55,039
Now Jordan

1242
01:04:55,551 --> 01:04:56,319
We're going to get to what

1243
01:04:56,575 --> 01:04:57,087
What is going to take us to

1244
01:04:57,599 --> 01:04:58,111
The end of the

1245
01:05:02,975 --> 01:05:03,487
V

1246
01:05:03,743 --> 01:05:04,767
Most

1247
01:05:05,023 --> 01:05:06,559
Extent of what Alex Jones like

1248
01:05:07,327 --> 01:05:09,375
So whenever somebody

1249
01:05:09,887 --> 01:05:10,655
Has been described

1250
01:05:11,423 --> 01:05:13,471
Subway

1251
01:05:13,983 --> 01:05:14,751
In the public eye

1252
01:05:15,007 --> 01:05:16,543
Cuz they're secretly liberals.

1253
01:05:16,799 --> 01:05:17,567
That's the only thing that makes

1254
01:05:17,823 --> 01:05:23,711
When Milo fell out of Grace

1255
01:05:23,967 --> 01:05:25,503
Yeah Alex

1256
01:05:26,271 --> 01:05:27,807
Quick to have him on his show

1257
01:05:28,063 --> 01:05:29,087
In order to try and get

1258
01:05:29,599 --> 01:05:31,391
Some of that sweet sweet attention

1259
01:05:31,647 --> 01:05:33,183
That comes along with a person be

1260
01:05:33,695 --> 01:05:35,743
The platform

1261
01:05:36,255 --> 01:05:37,279
I don't worry about that

1262
01:05:37,535 --> 01:05:38,815
Is 8

1263
01:05:39,071 --> 01:05:41,375
The exact same thing once somebody

1264
01:05:41,631 --> 01:05:42,911
Is in the Press enough

1265
01:05:43,167 --> 01:05:44,191
Alex wants to

1266
01:05:44,447 --> 01:05:44,959
The common

1267
01:05:45,215 --> 01:05:46,239
And ride their coattails

1268
01:05:46,495 --> 01:05:47,007
Yeah

1269
01:05:48,287 --> 01:05:50,079
SO2 the thirty-year-old

1270
01:05:57,247 --> 01:05:57,759
Now

1271
01:05:58,527 --> 01:05:59,039
Ennis

1272
01:05:59,551 --> 01:06:00,063
Interview

1273
01:06:00,575 --> 01:06:01,343
There's a really interesting

1274
01:06:01,599 --> 01:06:02,111
Dynamic

1275
01:06:02,367 --> 01:06:03,391
Play and that is

1276
01:06:03,647 --> 01:06:05,183
That Alex wants to

1277
01:06:06,207 --> 01:06:06,975
Inspired

1278
01:06:07,487 --> 01:06:08,767
He wants to tell Gavin

1279
01:06:09,023 --> 01:06:09,535
You need

1280
01:06:10,047 --> 01:06:10,815
To get on your f***

1281
01:06:11,071 --> 01:06:11,583
Walking bike

1282
01:06:22,079 --> 01:06:23,615
And he says that they

1283
01:06:30,271 --> 01:06:30,783
Hindrance

1284
01:06:31,039 --> 01:06:36,159
Then just call them Nazi and racist again and again and again and then they spend their time defending

1285
01:06:36,415 --> 01:06:36,927
That

1286
01:06:40,255 --> 01:06:46,143
We're just busy

1287
01:06:46,399 --> 01:06:48,191
I mean if you say where can people find me

1288
01:06:48,447 --> 01:06:49,215
Nowhere

1289
01:06:51,007 --> 01:06:51,775
I'm done

1290
01:06:53,567 --> 01:06:56,639
You coming on here and Alex is going to try and like the

1291
01:06:57,151 --> 01:07:01,503
You we got it you got to fight you got to fight and consistently Gavin's like

1292
01:07:02,015 --> 01:07:02,527
No

1293
01:07:03,039 --> 01:07:05,855
I would done

1294
01:07:08,927 --> 01:07:12,511
Hilarious

1295
01:07:13,023 --> 01:07:14,815
I don't I don't know if he's trolling Alex

1296
01:07:15,071 --> 01:07:18,655
I don't know what's going on I hate Gavin McInnes

1297
01:07:18,911 --> 01:07:19,423
Brain

1298
01:07:19,679 --> 01:07:20,447
He is awful

1299
01:07:21,727 --> 01:07:23,519
But in this episode

1300
01:07:24,031 --> 01:07:26,079
Because he

1301
01:07:28,127 --> 01:07:29,407
It drives Alex

1302
01:07:29,663 --> 01:07:35,807
Points of insanity we have not seen in a very long time

1303
01:07:36,831 --> 01:07:38,111
Complains about what the Liberals

1304
01:07:43,231 --> 01:07:45,023
In order to make sure

1305
01:07:45,279 --> 01:07:46,815
They appear to be human

1306
01:07:47,327 --> 01:07:49,887
Robin Wright

1307
01:07:50,399 --> 01:07:55,519
Interrupt

1308
01:07:58,079 --> 01:08:01,151
Here's another trick

1309
01:08:04,223 --> 01:08:05,503
Pick protection of their kids

1310
01:08:11,135 --> 01:08:13,183
And you

1311
01:08:13,439 --> 01:08:14,719
That's a wonderful family person

1312
01:08:14,975 --> 01:08:20,607
You're scowling like this

1313
01:08:20,863 --> 01:08:25,471
And then you can make

1314
01:08:25,983 --> 01:08:27,775
He can you can vanish

1315
01:08:28,031 --> 01:08:30,591
If I can get rid of a person I got rid of Hitler

1316
01:08:32,383 --> 01:08:36,223
Gavin McInnes has featured his son and a number of the videos he posted online

1317
01:08:36,735 --> 01:08:39,039
Also point of order

1318
01:08:39,295 --> 01:08:45,439
He's done work for him on air broadcast was there when Alex

1319
01:08:45,695 --> 01:08:47,487
Bernie Sanders at an airport

1320
01:08:47,743 --> 01:08:52,607
What the f*** do your family

1321
01:08:53,119 --> 01:08:59,263
What are those perfect no one would have a problem

1322
01:08:59,519 --> 01:09:00,543
At all if they presented

1323
01:09:00,799 --> 01:09:01,311
Did themselves

1324
01:09:02,079 --> 01:09:02,591
With their family

1325
01:09:03,103 --> 01:09:07,455
No one would get like you they wouldn't get any more threats than people on the left

1326
01:09:07,711 --> 01:09:08,991
By the way

1327
01:09:11,295 --> 01:09:12,575
Way more

1328
01:09:13,855 --> 01:09:15,647
They can't possibly believe that

1329
01:09:16,415 --> 01:09:18,719
This has to be like

1330
01:09:18,975 --> 01:09:21,279
It's just outright or arguing for victim

1331
01:09:21,791 --> 01:09:22,815
Goodyear

1332
01:09:23,071 --> 01:09:25,631
Outside of the Alex trying to inspire Gavin

1333
01:09:25,887 --> 01:09:26,911
No

1334
01:09:27,167 --> 01:09:28,191
Outside of that

1335
01:09:28,703 --> 01:09:33,055
The entire interview is about Alex saying that the proud boys are really awesome

1336
01:09:33,311 --> 01:09:34,079
They're Heroes

1337
01:09:34,335 --> 01:09:37,407
They're the victims in all this cuz antifa keep starting fight

1338
01:09:37,663 --> 01:09:39,455
And that the proud boys finish

1339
01:09:39,711 --> 01:09:41,503
And then at the same time

1340
01:09:41,759 --> 01:09:47,135
The line of we are the greatest and strongest but also were the victim of every

1341
01:09:47,647 --> 01:09:50,463
Don't understand how you can actually believe that

1342
01:09:50,975 --> 01:09:54,047
Like because because all of that like because

1343
01:10:02,495 --> 01:10:08,639
Finishing them on the ground as the them up as a group

1344
01:10:10,687 --> 01:10:11,455
Lightspeed

1345
01:10:11,711 --> 01:10:13,759
The metaphor that dr. Whitaker

1346
01:10:14,783 --> 01:10:15,551
A2000

1347
01:10:15,807 --> 01:10:16,319
We were talking about

1348
01:10:16,831 --> 01:10:19,135
That strategy the doctors of

1349
01:10:19,647 --> 01:10:20,927
People have healthy 6:30

1350
01:10:21,183 --> 01:10:21,951
It's the same thing

1351
01:10:22,207 --> 01:10:24,767
They know that they have to present this idea of

1352
01:10:25,279 --> 01:10:30,911
Ask Macho super-powered Western males who are ready ready to fight

1353
01:10:31,935 --> 01:10:34,751
Cuz I need that to get people interested in joining

1354
01:10:35,007 --> 01:10:37,055
But at the same time they have to have that

1355
01:10:37,823 --> 01:10:38,335
That is

1356
01:10:38,591 --> 01:10:40,383
We're the victims of everything

1357
01:10:40,639 --> 01:10:41,663
Conspiracy against.

1358
01:10:41,919 --> 01:10:44,223
To explain why they're not successful in anything

1359
01:10:45,247 --> 01:10:47,039
Because otherwise people who are attracted to

1360
01:10:47,295 --> 01:10:48,575
To the masculine power

1361
01:10:48,831 --> 01:10:49,599
That they're presenting

1362
01:10:49,855 --> 01:10:50,879
What is start asking question

1363
01:10:52,415 --> 01:10:52,927
Done

1364
01:10:53,183 --> 01:10:54,975
Wyatt why is this just like

1365
01:10:56,255 --> 01:10:56,767
Do you know

1366
01:10:57,023 --> 01:10:57,535
It's

1367
01:10:57,791 --> 01:10:58,303
The same strategy

1368
01:10:58,559 --> 01:10:59,839
Do you have to walk

1369
01:11:00,351 --> 01:11:00,863
If you don't

1370
01:11:01,375 --> 01:11:01,887
There's a problem

1371
01:11:02,399 --> 01:11:05,983
You don't get recruitment without the masculinity and power and you don't

1372
01:11:06,239 --> 01:11:06,751
Get retention

1373
01:11:07,007 --> 01:11:07,519
Without the

1374
01:11:07,775 --> 01:11:09,311
The facade of conspiracy against

1375
01:11:09,567 --> 01:11:11,871
I think that

1376
01:11:12,383 --> 01:11:14,687
The victimhood at this point probably

1377
01:11:14,943 --> 01:11:16,991
Proud boys band

1378
01:11:17,503 --> 01:11:21,087
That like the fantasy I don't know maybe is masculinity

1379
01:11:21,343 --> 01:11:23,391
But the reality is Aldi's

1380
01:11:23,647 --> 01:11:25,183
Disinfected

1381
01:11:25,439 --> 01:11:26,463
White nationalist

1382
01:11:26,719 --> 01:11:27,487
Are are like

1383
01:11:27,999 --> 01:11:29,791
Why aren't I allowed it

1384
01:11:30,047 --> 01:11:32,863
Do everything I want to do and then they join us

1385
01:11:33,119 --> 01:11:34,655
You're possibly right that

1386
01:11:36,447 --> 01:11:37,471
The victimhood part is

1387
01:11:37,983 --> 01:11:39,263
Appealing piece of it but

1388
01:11:39,519 --> 01:11:40,543
Even in that

1389
01:11:40,799 --> 01:11:42,335
Case even in so much as that

1390
01:11:43,103 --> 01:11:43,615
V

1391
01:11:46,175 --> 01:11:48,479
Is the proposed solution to those

1392
01:11:48,735 --> 01:11:49,247
Exactly

1393
01:11:49,503 --> 01:11:50,271
So that's

1394
01:11:52,063 --> 01:11:53,599
Spiritually what

1395
01:11:53,855 --> 01:11:55,391
22 is the scapegoating

1396
01:11:55,647 --> 01:11:56,927
An excuse for your own in

1397
01:11:57,183 --> 01:11:59,743
Sexual life

1398
01:11:59,999 --> 01:12:00,767
What is

1399
01:12:01,023 --> 01:12:03,839
Really drawing you is the idea of

1400
01:12:04,351 --> 01:12:05,887
These Rowdy men

1401
01:12:06,399 --> 01:12:07,167
Who like to fight

1402
01:12:08,191 --> 01:12:11,519
The answer is that these feelings

1403
01:12:11,775 --> 01:12:15,871
Meanwhile you joined up and then you find out all those feelings are really with motivating

1404
01:12:16,127 --> 01:12:17,151
And then your service

1405
01:12:17,663 --> 01:12:20,991
Finally finally a group

1406
01:12:21,247 --> 01:12:25,855
Come together and decided that violence will solve their problem

1407
01:12:27,391 --> 01:12:29,183
Always I've been waiting a tight

1408
01:12:31,999 --> 01:12:36,351
Time for the true Awakening form n4110 the human

1409
01:12:37,375 --> 01:12:38,143
To come together in

1410
01:12:38,399 --> 01:12:39,167
Decide that violence

1411
01:12:39,423 --> 01:12:40,191
People solve problem

1412
01:12:40,703 --> 01:12:41,983
New York

1413
01:12:42,239 --> 01:12:44,031
After that meeting

1414
01:12:45,055 --> 01:12:46,335
Or whatever the Gavin dead

1415
01:12:46,591 --> 01:12:47,871
There was of course the incident

1416
01:12:50,175 --> 01:12:52,223
In trouble with the law

1417
01:12:53,247 --> 01:12:57,599
You know if you look at multiple angles of it that are synced up definitely see

1418
01:12:57,855 --> 01:12:59,903
What the situation is

1419
01:13:00,159 --> 01:13:00,671
Is the proud boys

1420
01:13:00,927 --> 01:13:02,463
We're charging at these people

1421
01:13:02,719 --> 01:13:06,047
One of them threw something at the people who were already charging at them

1422
01:13:06,303 --> 01:13:07,839
And then the fight started

1423
01:13:08,351 --> 01:13:12,447
So the ideas boys were victims and that is

1424
01:13:12,703 --> 01:13:14,239
That is the presentation

1425
01:13:14,495 --> 01:13:15,263
The Gavin is going

1426
01:13:15,519 --> 01:13:16,031
Put out onto the

1427
01:13:17,567 --> 01:13:21,151
Disperse they went around the block came back

1428
01:13:21,407 --> 01:13:22,687
These guys

1429
01:13:34,975 --> 01:13:36,255
And they say FU Pig

1430
01:13:36,767 --> 01:13:37,279
Band

1431
01:13:40,095 --> 01:13:41,887
Just not accurate based on the video.

1432
01:13:46,239 --> 01:13:48,031
I can't being on the show

1433
01:13:48,799 --> 01:13:51,359
He has nothing to plug and he says he's done with all the s***

1434
01:13:51,615 --> 01:13:53,151
So like all he wants

1435
01:13:54,431 --> 01:13:57,503
Donate to help these guys because they're in legal trouble

1436
01:13:58,015 --> 01:14:04,159
The only thing you plugs is the fundraiser for his proud boys

1437
01:14:04,415 --> 01:14:04,927
Citrus 2

1438
01:14:05,439 --> 01:14:06,207
Jose

1439
01:14:06,463 --> 01:14:07,999
Vixen

1440
01:14:08,255 --> 01:14:09,023
Resent that

1441
01:14:10,303 --> 01:14:13,375
And he even goes on to say that like his whole

1442
01:14:13,631 --> 01:14:15,935
Video where he disavowed

1443
01:14:16,191 --> 01:14:18,239
Proud boys are whatever

1444
01:14:18,751 --> 01:14:20,543
Alex is trying to present it as like

1445
01:14:20,799 --> 01:14:21,823
They were threatening

1446
01:14:22,335 --> 01:14:22,847
So you did

1447
01:14:23,871 --> 01:14:26,431
And Gavin explained very clearly that the situation

1448
01:14:26,943 --> 01:14:29,503
In order for some group to be called a gang

1449
01:14:30,015 --> 01:14:31,551
Legal definition

1450
01:14:32,063 --> 01:14:34,367
Require crimes

1451
01:14:34,623 --> 01:14:35,391
And there has to be a leader

1452
01:14:35,903 --> 01:14:39,231
So if there isn't a leader it hurts the argument that there's a gang

1453
01:14:39,743 --> 01:14:40,255
So

1454
01:14:40,511 --> 01:14:42,047
His intention was to get on

1455
01:14:42,303 --> 01:14:43,839
Publicly is a

1456
01:14:44,095 --> 01:14:44,863
Best he could

1457
01:14:45,119 --> 01:14:45,631
2

1458
01:14:45,887 --> 01:14:48,447
Step down as the leader of this group

1459
01:14:48,703 --> 01:14:50,495
Eid

1460
01:14:50,751 --> 01:14:52,799
Is the leader of a gang

1461
01:14:53,055 --> 01:14:55,615
But if you did that maybe you would help with her sentencing

1462
01:14:55,871 --> 01:14:56,639
Because the

1463
01:14:58,175 --> 01:14:59,455
Right

1464
01:14:59,711 --> 01:15:00,223
Someone being like you

1465
01:15:00,479 --> 01:15:01,247
You step down Route

1466
01:15:02,527 --> 01:15:03,295
Track though

1467
01:15:03,551 --> 01:15:04,575
Because wouldn't

1468
01:15:05,855 --> 01:15:07,391
Like him sayings

1469
01:15:07,903 --> 01:15:09,951
He knows that this is why they would be

1470
01:15:10,207 --> 01:15:10,975
Considered a gang

1471
01:15:11,487 --> 01:15:13,791
Suggest that he knew they were a gang

1472
01:15:14,047 --> 01:15:15,071
Prosecutor

1473
01:15:15,583 --> 01:15:21,727
Infowars

1474
01:15:22,239 --> 01:15:24,287
What is essentially saying

1475
01:15:24,543 --> 01:15:25,311
He's admitting that

1476
01:15:25,567 --> 01:15:29,407
Hindu they were a gang and they are again

1477
01:15:30,687 --> 01:15:31,199
So

1478
01:15:32,479 --> 01:15:36,063
Stupid on Rogan I think his direct quote was I started a game

1479
01:15:37,343 --> 01:15:39,903
There is something

1480
01:15:40,927 --> 01:15:45,535
There is something to be said about the fact that he unlike so many other

1481
01:15:45,791 --> 01:15:46,303
Craven

1482
01:15:46,559 --> 01:15:47,071
Stupid

1483
01:15:47,583 --> 01:15:49,887
Opportunistic assholes it is

1484
01:15:50,143 --> 01:15:51,935
Still holding a fundraiser for the

1485
01:15:52,447 --> 01:15:55,007
You guys go ahead of just abandon

1486
01:15:55,263 --> 01:15:56,543
I don't think that

1487
01:15:57,055 --> 01:16:01,151
I think that's the definition of cold comfort and he acted like a

1488
01:16:01,407 --> 01:16:07,551
Kind of got to give a little bit of

1489
01:16:12,671 --> 01:16:13,695
Distance myself from

1490
01:16:21,375 --> 01:16:21,887
Gavin

1491
01:16:22,143 --> 01:16:23,423
Probably filled response

1492
01:16:24,191 --> 01:16:27,519
We're leading these people into these groups that have been created it

1493
01:16:27,775 --> 01:16:29,823
The direct result of it

1494
01:16:30,847 --> 01:16:31,615
He publicly wants to

1495
01:16:31,871 --> 01:16:32,895
You place the blame

1496
01:16:34,431 --> 01:16:35,711
Define

1497
01:16:36,479 --> 01:16:40,319
No matter what you presenting and all that stuff yet

1498
01:16:40,575 --> 01:16:42,623
Valois version of a compliment I can

1499
01:16:44,415 --> 01:16:45,439
Could have not done

1500
01:16:48,255 --> 01:16:52,095
Not suffered from not

1501
01:16:52,607 --> 01:16:57,215
You get one more morality point that Alex Jones does which still puts you at -2

1502
01:16:57,471 --> 01:16:59,007
Alex

1503
01:17:03,871 --> 01:17:04,895
Yeah who knows what those

1504
01:17:05,663 --> 01:17:07,711
Anyway who cares

1505
01:17:07,967 --> 01:17:09,247
Because at this point

1506
01:17:09,503 --> 01:17:11,295
I kind of got the sense that

1507
01:17:11,551 --> 01:17:13,087
Gavin is on for the reasons

1508
01:17:14,623 --> 01:17:15,135
Which is

1509
01:17:15,647 --> 01:17:17,695
Rewrite the history of that New York event

1510
01:17:17,951 --> 01:17:18,463
Course

1511
01:17:18,975 --> 01:17:21,535
Like just make the proud boys look like there

1512
01:17:21,791 --> 01:17:22,303
Western

1513
01:17:22,559 --> 01:17:23,071
Gyros

1514
01:17:23,327 --> 01:17:23,839
And stuff like that

1515
01:17:24,607 --> 01:17:25,119
Basically proper

1516
01:17:25,375 --> 01:17:26,399
Buganda

1517
01:17:26,655 --> 01:17:28,191
Is going to ride the coattails of

1518
01:17:28,447 --> 01:17:30,751
Gavin just kicked off Glenn Beck Network

1519
01:17:31,007 --> 01:17:32,543
That's a great moment for me

1520
01:17:32,799 --> 01:17:34,591
I can now take him maybe trying

1521
01:17:34,847 --> 01:17:36,127
Get him on Infowars

1522
01:17:36,383 --> 01:17:37,151
Maybe I can

1523
01:17:37,407 --> 01:17:38,431
Or at very least

1524
01:17:38,687 --> 01:17:40,735
On my show is going to get me a lot of it

1525
01:17:41,247 --> 01:17:43,551
I thought that was the games are playing

1526
01:17:44,063 --> 01:17:45,855
I almost didn't want to cover it

1527
01:17:46,111 --> 01:17:46,879
Cuz I almost felt like

1528
01:17:47,135 --> 01:17:47,903
You hate Gavin

1529
01:17:48,927 --> 01:17:50,463
No one really likes Gavin that much

1530
01:17:50,975 --> 01:17:53,791
But then Alex that this

1531
01:18:01,983 --> 01:18:03,775
Famous

1532
01:18:04,543 --> 01:18:08,127
Read the entire inherently bad

1533
01:18:10,431 --> 01:18:11,711
Michael Evans behling

1534
01:18:19,391 --> 01:18:20,927
Taxi

1535
01:18:21,183 --> 01:18:23,743
Jean-Pierre races

1536
01:18:26,047 --> 01:18:30,399
White Martin Luther King

1537
01:18:32,191 --> 01:18:37,567
Alex loves to throw around

1538
01:18:38,847 --> 01:18:39,615
It's strange

1539
01:18:40,127 --> 01:18:43,967
How long is there are on that show

1540
01:18:45,503 --> 01:18:46,015
Wow

1541
01:18:48,831 --> 01:18:50,367
Give me

1542
01:18:50,623 --> 01:18:52,671
I'm not even asking for a ton of parallel

1543
01:18:53,183 --> 01:18:54,207
I am just asking

1544
01:18:54,463 --> 01:18:55,487
42 parallel

1545
01:18:55,999 --> 01:18:57,023
Between Gavin McInnes

1546
01:18:57,791 --> 01:18:58,815
Martin Luther King

1547
01:19:01,119 --> 01:19:02,911
Parallel

1548
01:19:05,215 --> 01:19:11,359
North America

1549
01:19:12,639 --> 01:19:13,151
I don't know

1550
01:19:13,663 --> 01:19:14,431
I feel like I've seen enough

1551
01:19:14,687 --> 01:19:15,967
Gavin's Shota

1552
01:19:18,271 --> 01:19:19,551
Hitman Martin Luther King have

1553
01:19:20,063 --> 01:19:23,391
Serious

1554
01:19:23,647 --> 01:19:25,695
I can't think of any

1555
01:19:26,207 --> 01:19:28,511
Not at all

1556
01:19:28,767 --> 01:19:31,839
Together in a room

1557
01:19:32,095 --> 01:19:33,631
F****** Ebony and Ivory man

1558
01:19:34,143 --> 01:19:34,911
That's what it would be

1559
01:19:35,423 --> 01:19:36,447
Google

1560
01:19:36,703 --> 01:19:37,215
Compilation of

1561
01:19:37,471 --> 01:19:37,983
Eclipse

1562
01:19:38,239 --> 01:19:40,799
Gavin McInnes

1563
01:19:41,055 --> 01:19:45,919
It's so easy to imagine Martin Luther King save those things

1564
01:19:47,967 --> 01:19:49,759
So

1565
01:19:52,575 --> 01:19:54,111
In order to reinforce

1566
01:19:54,367 --> 01:19:54,879
Gavin

1567
01:19:55,135 --> 01:19:57,439
Ideas there's a victim

1568
01:19:58,207 --> 01:19:59,487
The proud boys are the victim

1569
01:19:59,743 --> 01:20:02,815
Traffic situation

1570
01:20:04,095 --> 01:20:04,607
Bulshit

1571
01:20:10,751 --> 01:20:13,311
Document

1572
01:20:14,080 --> 01:20:14,848
11 months ago

1573
01:20:24,832 --> 01:20:25,856
Alexander Soros

1574
01:20:30,208 --> 01:20:33,536
How to try to get black Americans to Riot

1575
01:20:34,048 --> 01:20:37,120
We have all this.

1576
01:20:37,376 --> 01:20:39,680
Baltimore

1577
01:20:40,192 --> 01:20:43,008
These are real document this is what they do

1578
01:20:43,264 --> 01:20:45,568
No it's not no it's not

1579
01:20:45,824 --> 01:20:46,592
Documents

1580
01:20:46,848 --> 01:20:47,872
So you found on 4chan

1581
01:20:50,176 --> 01:20:50,688
This is

1582
01:20:50,944 --> 01:20:51,712
This is crazy

1583
01:20:51,968 --> 01:20:52,480
Dishwasher

1584
01:20:53,504 --> 01:20:54,272
No because

1585
01:20:54,528 --> 01:20:57,600
It proves everything.

1586
01:20:58,112 --> 01:21:01,696
He doesn't have to

1587
01:21:01,952 --> 01:21:03,488
You could just be way less specific

1588
01:21:06,560 --> 01:21:08,352
It is interesting that he doesn't get to

1589
01:21:08,608 --> 01:21:09,376
Story Road

1590
01:21:09,888 --> 01:21:12,192
You know like yeah Wile and he does get the

1591
01:21:12,448 --> 01:21:14,752
About like it being a guy whose brother

1592
01:21:18,848 --> 01:21:23,712
At least muddy them so it's harder to dig me to figure out what he's talking about

1593
01:21:24,992 --> 01:21:25,504
It's because

1594
01:21:25,760 --> 01:21:26,528
It is

1595
01:21:26,784 --> 01:21:27,552
The Smoking Gun

1596
01:21:28,320 --> 01:21:28,832
Like I did

1597
01:21:30,368 --> 01:21:36,512
Papers are always the smoking goddamn behind all of this

1598
01:21:36,768 --> 01:21:40,864
The planet all the people who are free

1599
01:21:44,192 --> 01:21:48,032
They are just standing up

1600
01:21:48,800 --> 01:21:49,824
The agitation

1601
01:21:50,080 --> 01:21:51,360
The actual

1602
01:21:52,640 --> 01:21:54,688
A white nationalist

1603
01:21:55,456 --> 01:21:58,784
Who also

1604
01:21:59,040 --> 01:22:00,832
Wants to bring in martial law

1605
01:22:03,392 --> 01:22:04,416
George soros's plan

1606
01:22:04,672 --> 01:22:10,816
They ferment the race war which is required to bring in martial law

1607
01:22:11,072 --> 01:22:11,840
To a FEMA camp

1608
01:22:12,096 --> 01:22:16,704
I don't have any plans after that

1609
01:22:19,264 --> 01:22:21,312
So okay so you bringing martial arts

1610
01:22:21,824 --> 01:22:22,336
Dude

1611
01:22:22,592 --> 01:22:23,872
Stop the race worth

1612
01:22:24,384 --> 01:22:26,176
No because what you do

1613
01:22:26,432 --> 01:22:27,456
Deployed

1614
01:22:27,712 --> 01:22:28,224
Bio weapon

1615
01:22:29,504 --> 01:22:31,552
This is starting to become a good plan

1616
01:22:32,064 --> 01:22:33,600
No it's not

1617
01:22:34,624 --> 01:22:36,672
I mean

1618
01:22:41,280 --> 01:22:42,048
City has anyway

1619
01:22:42,816 --> 01:22:43,584
Jordan

1620
01:22:43,840 --> 01:22:44,352
I miss Mexico

1621
01:22:45,376 --> 01:22:45,888
We get to

1622
01:22:46,144 --> 01:22:46,912
What I would say

1623
01:22:47,168 --> 01:22:48,192
Is the reason for the season

1624
01:22:48,960 --> 01:22:50,496
Christmas is coming early

1625
01:22:50,752 --> 01:22:52,288
And this is

1626
01:22:52,544 --> 01:22:53,824
There are

1627
01:22:54,080 --> 01:22:54,592
Few things

1628
01:22:55,360 --> 01:22:57,152
Fill me with joy when I listen to Alice

1629
01:22:57,920 --> 01:22:59,200
Ain't like it's really tough

1630
01:22:59,456 --> 01:23:00,736
For me to sit here on this podcast

1631
01:23:01,248 --> 01:23:01,760
Until you

1632
01:23:02,016 --> 01:23:06,880
That Alex Jones and Gavin McInnes brought me a ton of Joy but this next clip

1633
01:23:07,136 --> 01:23:08,416
The Dynamics at play

1634
01:23:09,952 --> 01:23:10,464
F******

1635
01:23:10,720 --> 01:23:11,488
Hilarious

1636
01:23:13,024 --> 01:23:16,864
I'm already 5000

1637
01:23:17,120 --> 01:23:18,400
Points with you

1638
01:23:18,656 --> 01:23:19,680
You're a smart guy

1639
01:23:20,448 --> 01:23:21,984
I've been through this I learned

1640
01:23:22,752 --> 01:23:26,336
Years ago just say you're sorry the Sandy Hook parents

1641
01:23:44,512 --> 01:23:48,608
People getting

1642
01:23:49,120 --> 01:23:51,168
Holy mackerel

1643
01:23:52,960 --> 01:23:55,008
I just said just say you're sorry is all.

1644
01:23:55,264 --> 01:23:55,776
I said that

1645
01:23:56,544 --> 01:23:57,312
Kitchen

1646
01:23:58,080 --> 01:24:04,224
He's sending people their houses right now

1647
01:24:06,016 --> 01:24:07,040
No one's saying that

1648
01:24:07,296 --> 01:24:12,160
They're just saying that because of the rhetoric that he perpetuated people have been showing up at harassment

1649
01:24:24,192 --> 01:24:25,472
Shut up

1650
01:24:26,240 --> 01:24:30,336
It's all a setup

1651
01:24:30,592 --> 01:24:34,944
Any prosecutor because they've learned how to use our Humanity to manipulate us

1652
01:24:35,200 --> 01:24:36,480
You guys are heroes

1653
01:24:36,736 --> 01:24:37,760
You're a hero

1654
01:24:38,016 --> 01:24:40,576
They probably have never gotten arrested anywhere

1655
01:24:45,440 --> 01:24:47,744
Thank you

1656
01:24:48,256 --> 01:24:50,304
Your Hiroshima

1657
01:24:52,864 --> 01:24:54,912
Turn on the persecution

1658
01:25:00,288 --> 01:25:01,312
Distraught

1659
01:25:01,568 --> 01:25:07,712
Destroyed

1660
01:25:07,968 --> 01:25:14,112
They want about that

1661
01:25:16,416 --> 01:25:21,536
Stephen Hawking

1662
01:25:22,304 --> 01:25:26,144
Appropriate

1663
01:25:26,400 --> 01:25:29,728
Somebody is f****** with it

1664
01:25:29,984 --> 01:25:33,056
Lecture about how like

1665
01:25:33,312 --> 01:25:38,176
You know when you say sorry that's when they attack you the most cuz they try and manipulate ER Humanity

1666
01:25:41,760 --> 01:25:43,552
Destroyed me

1667
01:25:47,904 --> 01:25:50,208
Nope not the Six Million Dollar Man I'm

1668
01:25:50,464 --> 01:25:50,976
Stephen Hawking

1669
01:25:54,304 --> 01:26:00,448
Glenn Beck weird outfit out

1670
01:26:01,984 --> 01:26:03,776
I can't go back to Rebel media

1671
01:26:04,288 --> 01:26:06,592
I love I love how Alex

1672
01:26:06,848 --> 01:26:08,384
You can't afford me

1673
01:26:08,640 --> 01:26:09,664
Actually

1674
01:26:09,920 --> 01:26:13,760
Gavin have to get before he

1675
01:26:14,272 --> 01:26:15,296
Jones Infowars

1676
01:26:16,320 --> 01:26:17,600
I don't know I think I think

1677
01:26:21,184 --> 01:26:22,464
In terms of him saying I'm out

1678
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,304
But I could easily see someone like him being like

1679
01:26:28,864 --> 01:26:32,448
The Coincidence of this line of fascism that I've been going down

1680
01:26:32,960 --> 01:26:33,472
Cuz it Doesn't

1681
01:26:33,984 --> 01:26:35,520
Like as much as he is a monster

1682
01:26:35,776 --> 01:26:36,288
He's LED like these

1683
01:26:36,544 --> 01:26:37,824
Is really horrible things

1684
01:26:38,080 --> 01:26:39,360
Colonel

1685
01:26:39,616 --> 01:26:40,128
Sims 2

1686
01:26:40,640 --> 01:26:41,152
Think that

1687
01:26:41,408 --> 01:26:41,920
He's joking

1688
01:26:42,176 --> 01:26:46,272
Like he thinks he's drunk

1689
01:26:48,320 --> 01:26:48,832
Isaac

1690
01:26:49,088 --> 01:26:51,392
He could walk away from the knot

1691
01:26:51,648 --> 01:26:52,160
Any like

1692
01:26:52,416 --> 01:26:54,976
Shores of credibility or anything like that

1693
01:26:55,232 --> 01:26:56,256
But he could walk away from this

1694
01:26:56,512 --> 01:26:57,024
Forget a f******

1695
01:27:00,352 --> 01:27:02,144
I don't know

1696
01:27:03,680 --> 01:27:04,192
If he's not

1697
01:27:04,448 --> 01:27:05,472
You f***** up

1698
01:27:05,728 --> 01:27:09,568
A lot of money when he was bought out at Feist

1699
01:27:09,824 --> 01:27:12,384
I assume you didn't invest that all-in proud boys

1700
01:27:12,640 --> 01:27:18,784
A lot of money off of

1701
01:27:19,040 --> 01:27:20,064
35 Grand right

1702
01:27:20,576 --> 01:27:21,344
Think it's 350

1703
01:27:21,856 --> 01:27:23,392
300

1704
01:27:23,648 --> 01:27:27,744
I thought he said 35,000

1705
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:28,512
Points

1706
01:27:28,768 --> 01:27:29,792
You got to keep going

1707
01:27:33,120 --> 01:27:33,632
I don't know

1708
01:27:34,144 --> 01:27:37,728
To Delight in someone else's misery or anyting

1709
01:27:39,264 --> 01:27:41,056
I can also say like

1710
01:27:41,824 --> 01:27:43,104
Hearing him say

1711
01:27:43,360 --> 01:27:43,872
You don't like

1712
01:27:44,896 --> 01:27:48,480
These are the consequences of going downhill

1713
01:27:48,992 --> 01:27:51,296
I can see where you coming from

1714
01:27:54,112 --> 01:27:54,624
Jump about guide

1715
01:27:55,136 --> 01:27:57,184
Something that I could not have ever imagined

1716
01:27:57,696 --> 01:27:58,976
He technically probably kill the guy

1717
01:27:59,232 --> 01:28:01,280
No he's older than Alex

1718
01:28:02,560 --> 01:28:05,376
Will be.

1719
01:28:05,632 --> 01:28:07,424
Also this code starts with

1720
01:28:07,680 --> 01:28:08,448
Did they stick $90

1721
01:28:08,704 --> 01:28:12,800
It starts with them having an exchange that I think they thought was off

1722
01:28:18,688 --> 01:28:21,504
Better Stronger Faster

1723
01:28:25,856 --> 01:28:27,136
Listen

1724
01:28:33,792 --> 01:28:39,936
Alex Jones

1725
01:28:40,192 --> 01:28:46,336
Listen to me

1726
01:28:46,592 --> 01:28:52,736
5

1727
01:28:52,992 --> 01:28:59,136
I've already been higher up the mountain and then to the same attacks called control wrote It's all blue

1728
01:29:07,840 --> 01:29:13,984
I think I didn't realize his mic was hot mistake

1729
01:29:14,240 --> 01:29:16,544
That doesn't answer that question

1730
01:29:16,800 --> 01:29:19,360
That's nuts that's wild stuff

1731
01:29:20,384 --> 01:29:21,920
Good

1732
01:29:25,760 --> 01:29:28,832
Although although I did see a picture of them

1733
01:29:30,112 --> 01:29:30,624
Avenue

1734
01:29:30,880 --> 01:29:31,392
Almost

1735
01:29:32,416 --> 01:29:35,232
I did see a picture of him and his beard is not as terrible as it

1736
01:29:35,744 --> 01:29:41,888
No that is unfortunate but I will I will give

1737
01:29:42,144 --> 01:29:44,448
Not the awful Victory beard he had

1738
01:29:44,704 --> 01:29:45,216
Before

1739
01:29:45,472 --> 01:29:46,496
But it is also like

1740
01:29:47,264 --> 01:29:47,776
You spend a lot of time

1741
01:29:48,544 --> 01:29:51,872
He has the look of someone who takes the long time in a mirror

1742
01:29:52,640 --> 01:29:58,784
Getting those getting just the right line

1743
01:30:06,976 --> 01:30:08,000
I really wish

1744
01:30:08,256 --> 01:30:10,048
I really wish Alex would have answered

1745
01:30:10,560 --> 01:30:11,072
Question what mistake

1746
01:30:11,840 --> 01:30:17,984
I really want to know what it is interesting to think I don't want to know what mistakes Alex thinks they made

1747
01:30:18,496 --> 01:30:20,288
Rhetorical

1748
01:30:20,544 --> 01:30:21,056
To listen to it

1749
01:30:21,312 --> 01:30:23,616
Using sign language

1750
01:30:24,896 --> 01:30:25,920
Don't blame yourself.

1751
01:30:28,480 --> 01:30:29,760
Trooper that I know you can be

1752
01:30:35,648 --> 01:30:38,720
I'm so I've been selling it

1753
01:30:38,976 --> 01:30:40,000
Pretty hard this ATF

1754
01:30:40,512 --> 01:30:41,536
Dynamic

1755
01:30:42,816 --> 01:30:43,328
A couple things

1756
01:30:43,584 --> 01:30:44,096
Already

1757
01:30:44,352 --> 01:30:45,632
Do you like

1758
01:30:46,400 --> 01:30:47,680
I'm done

1759
01:30:47,936 --> 01:30:49,216
Which zone

1760
01:30:49,472 --> 01:30:50,752
Very funny hilarious

1761
01:30:51,008 --> 01:30:54,080
But this next clip is really where everything comes to a head

1762
01:30:54,336 --> 01:30:55,360
And Alex has

1763
01:30:56,640 --> 01:30:58,176
A profound breakdown on a

1764
01:30:59,200 --> 01:31:01,760
Standing up for yourself I also

1765
01:31:02,016 --> 01:31:08,160
You can't believe how corrupt the yard believe how they lie

1766
01:31:18,400 --> 01:31:21,728
Pre-rolled

1767
01:31:23,520 --> 01:31:24,544
Okay I'll

1768
01:31:25,056 --> 01:31:26,592
But you understand

1769
01:31:26,848 --> 01:31:29,920
This has been shown to children adults need to know what the hell's going on

1770
01:31:30,176 --> 01:31:36,320
You're right but

1771
01:31:57,568 --> 01:31:58,080
Nice try

1772
01:31:59,616 --> 01:32:05,248
That's one attitude attitude

1773
01:32:25,472 --> 01:32:26,240
Call family.

1774
01:32:45,952 --> 01:32:46,720
Doing all right

1775
01:32:46,976 --> 01:32:47,744
Upset

1776
01:32:56,960 --> 01:32:59,008
No I'm not really familiar with vaccines

1777
01:33:08,480 --> 01:33:10,528
Gavin is not a famous comedian

1778
01:33:11,040 --> 01:33:14,624
There's a pretty good timing in there

1779
01:33:14,880 --> 01:33:21,024
You seemed upset that is great that's great that's one way of looking at

1780
01:33:22,560 --> 01:33:27,936
Attempts to deal with Alex like just Roid Rage

1781
01:33:28,192 --> 01:33:29,216
Freakout nonsense

1782
01:33:29,472 --> 01:33:31,520
You can't even imagine

1783
01:33:31,776 --> 01:33:33,312
Spitting variance

1784
01:33:33,568 --> 01:33:37,408
What about Raven god dammit them over and over and over again

1785
01:33:37,664 --> 01:33:42,016
Trying to justify his use of goddamn on the radio

1786
01:33:43,552 --> 01:33:45,344
I'm ready to kill people

1787
01:33:49,184 --> 01:33:50,720
Wake my brain just had a thought

1788
01:33:50,976 --> 01:33:57,120
And that thought is don't say that out loud on the air about straight-up murder

1789
01:33:57,376 --> 01:34:03,520
He wants to kill people might want to kill people actually wants to kill people

1790
01:34:03,776 --> 01:34:04,544
Yeah that's

1791
01:34:07,616 --> 01:34:10,432
That to me like what I heard that first of all I was like

1792
01:34:10,688 --> 01:34:11,712
My mouth was open

1793
01:34:11,968 --> 01:34:12,992
My jaw hit the floor

1794
01:34:13,248 --> 01:34:15,552
When you launched off on that for

1795
01:34:15,808 --> 01:34:20,160
Straight about how low

1796
01:34:20,416 --> 01:34:21,696
Like the problem isn't

1797
01:34:21,952 --> 01:34:22,464
You

1798
01:34:22,976 --> 01:34:24,256
The problem is that you keep

1799
01:34:25,792 --> 01:34:26,816
Steven Souza problem

1800
01:34:27,072 --> 01:34:31,680
Arise drag queens crossdressers

1801
01:34:31,936 --> 01:34:35,264
And make them all out to be pedophiles with my propaganda nonsense

1802
01:34:35,520 --> 01:34:36,288
The radio station

1803
01:34:41,664 --> 01:34:42,688
And then he gets into one

1804
01:34:46,272 --> 01:34:49,088
Do like I do like the way

1805
01:34:49,344 --> 01:34:51,136
Put that story of the radius

1806
01:34:56,256 --> 01:34:57,280
To be out there people need

1807
01:34:57,536 --> 01:35:00,096
Well we're getting a lot of complaints

1808
01:35:00,608 --> 01:35:01,888
Yeah you're right but please

1809
01:35:02,144 --> 01:35:06,496
Exam just like

1810
01:35:07,264 --> 01:35:09,056
Mollify hey you're right

1811
01:35:09,312 --> 01:35:10,080
Go away

1812
01:35:11,872 --> 01:35:12,384
See that email chain

1813
01:35:12,640 --> 01:35:14,176
I'd like to point out that

1814
01:35:15,200 --> 01:35:18,272
The other thing that made me lose my shoe

1815
01:35:18,784 --> 01:35:19,296
Well I was looking

1816
01:35:19,552 --> 01:35:20,832
To this

1817
01:35:21,856 --> 01:35:23,904
Like you so much

1818
01:35:24,160 --> 01:35:26,464
His trick of always talk about always

1819
01:35:26,720 --> 01:35:27,488
Is hilarious

1820
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:28,768
But

1821
01:35:31,584 --> 01:35:33,888
The immediately

1822
01:35:36,704 --> 01:35:40,288
And you got it wrong

1823
01:35:40,544 --> 01:35:41,312
Steven

1824
01:35:41,824 --> 01:35:44,384
Get your hands off me

1825
01:35:45,664 --> 01:35:51,808
What's the Mandela effect

1826
01:36:00,256 --> 01:36:00,768
Fat

1827
01:36:02,816 --> 01:36:03,328
Apes

1828
01:36:03,840 --> 01:36:04,608
And man

1829
01:36:05,120 --> 01:36:06,912
Will live comfortably in harmony

1830
01:36:07,424 --> 01:36:08,704
Despite the fact that man

1831
01:36:09,216 --> 01:36:09,984
Obviously

1832
01:36:10,240 --> 01:36:12,544
Set off a nuclear weapons

1833
01:36:13,056 --> 01:36:16,128
Destroy the entire planet

1834
01:36:18,688 --> 01:36:19,968
Who is

1835
01:36:20,736 --> 01:36:21,504
Really the victim

1836
01:36:22,784 --> 01:36:26,624
Alex might not have seen all five of them

1837
01:36:27,904 --> 01:36:29,440
Beneath the Planet of the Apes disease

1838
01:36:29,696 --> 01:36:30,208
Profound

1839
01:36:30,464 --> 01:36:30,976
Play f*****-up movie

1840
01:36:31,232 --> 01:36:32,000
I love it

1841
01:36:34,816 --> 01:36:35,584
Is profoundly f*****

1842
01:36:37,888 --> 01:36:39,168
So that was that was sort of

1843
01:36:39,424 --> 01:36:40,448
The meat of Alex

1844
01:36:40,704 --> 01:36:41,216
Freak out

1845
01:36:44,800 --> 01:36:46,080
Which is the mic down

1846
01:36:46,336 --> 01:36:46,848
Cuz this

1847
01:36:47,104 --> 01:36:47,616
Tumi

1848
01:36:48,128 --> 01:36:50,176
In one minute's time it walks

1849
01:36:50,432 --> 01:36:51,456
The Game of Life

1850
01:36:52,224 --> 01:36:52,992
Really f***** up

1851
01:36:53,248 --> 01:36:54,528
Really hilarious

1852
01:36:55,808 --> 01:36:56,576
Almost blasphemy

1853
01:37:00,672 --> 01:37:02,976
My grandmother

1854
01:37:18,080 --> 01:37:19,872
I'm doing a lot of praying past month

1855
01:37:22,944 --> 01:37:25,504
Apologize

1856
01:37:26,272 --> 01:37:31,648
But I really do

1857
01:37:32,160 --> 01:37:34,976
Sweet

1858
01:37:35,232 --> 01:37:40,352
Hundred percent 100% folks I'm ready I'm trying to figure out

1860
01:37:45,984 --> 01:37:49,056
I want to spread the fire Liberty of your mind

1861
01:37:49,312 --> 01:37:51,872
Robert Mize

1862
01:37:57,760 --> 01:38:01,088
You'll be on fire as well in stock.

1863
01:38:03,648 --> 01:38:08,256
Financial support and support

1864
01:38:08,512 --> 01:38:10,560
That's too bad

1865
01:38:10,816 --> 01:38:16,960
Craze at is whiplash

1866
01:38:17,216 --> 01:38:19,264
Riverside

1867
01:38:19,776 --> 01:38:25,920
Kind of like that

1868
01:38:26,176 --> 01:38:27,968
Start with it's time to pray

1869
01:38:41,536 --> 01:38:44,096
Probably real excited about the idea of a prank together

1870
01:38:44,352 --> 01:38:45,888
Do they got their juices going

1871
01:38:46,144 --> 01:38:47,936
I'm going to tell some s***

1872
01:38:51,264 --> 01:38:52,288

01:38:54,336 --> 01:38:54,848
Could not

1874
01:38:55,104 --> 01:38:55,872
Love that

1875
01:38:56,640 --> 01:39:00,480
Like I own the real price nobody else knows anything

1876
01:39:03,296 --> 01:39:04,320
You like a real

1877
01:39:06,368 --> 01:39:06,880
Exactly his

1878
01:39:08,416 --> 01:39:08,928
The magic

1879
01:39:11,744 --> 01:39:12,256
I need money

1880
01:39:15,840 --> 01:39:16,352
Did you ask

1881
01:39:16,608 --> 01:39:21,472
For your money you know it's really f***** up to isn't like that sort of mentality exist on

1882
01:39:21,984 --> 01:39:22,496
Should I wear

1883
01:39:22,752 --> 01:39:23,520
Demonize Noster

1884
01:39:25,056 --> 01:39:25,568
I will

1885
01:39:26,336 --> 01:39:26,848
Never

1886
01:39:27,104 --> 01:39:28,896
Ever understand people who

1887
01:39:29,152 --> 01:39:29,664
Claim ownership

1888
01:39:30,944 --> 01:39:31,456
And yet

1889
01:39:31,968 --> 01:39:32,480
Clearly

1890
01:39:32,992 --> 01:39:34,272
Know nothing about

1891
01:39:34,528 --> 01:39:35,040
What he was about

1892
01:39:35,296 --> 01:39:37,856
Right right

1893
01:39:38,112 --> 01:39:39,392
He was a Middle East

1894
01:39:40,160 --> 01:39:40,928
But I

1895
01:39:42,464 --> 01:39:43,232
Complained all the time

1896
01:39:44,512 --> 01:39:45,280
Is this sort of rhetoric

1897
01:39:45,536 --> 01:39:46,048
Is

1898
01:39:46,304 --> 01:39:46,816
He's not

1899
01:39:48,096 --> 01:39:48,864
Complaints about V

1900
01:39:52,960 --> 01:39:53,472
Because

1901
01:39:54,496 --> 01:39:55,008
So

1902
01:39:55,776 --> 01:39:57,056
They promised they were going to pray

1903
01:39:58,848 --> 01:40:00,128
I didn't want to hear

1904
01:40:01,664 --> 01:40:02,432
He forget about it

1905
01:40:02,688 --> 01:40:03,200
Start

1906
01:40:04,224 --> 01:40:06,528
And when they come back from break

1907
01:40:07,040 --> 01:40:12,416
Women

1908
01:40:12,672 --> 01:40:13,440
That sort of like

1909
01:40:13,696 --> 01:40:14,464
He's a famous

1910
01:40:14,720 --> 01:40:18,048
Famous comedian level

1911
01:40:18,560 --> 01:40:22,912
I'm so instead of actually getting to praying Alex wants to do something else

1912
01:40:23,680 --> 01:40:26,496
Elmo kick your ass if you don't get back on air

1913
01:40:26,752 --> 01:40:27,264
We come back

1914
01:40:28,288 --> 01:40:32,640
So that's break your going out to breakfast

1915
01:40:34,432 --> 01:40:35,200
This is

1916
01:40:37,248 --> 01:40:38,016
Rapidly

1917
01:40:38,528 --> 01:40:39,552
This is like a walk

1918
01:40:39,808 --> 01:40:40,576
Through Alex

1919
01:40:40,832 --> 01:40:44,160
Is bringing us all the doors keep opening up and you see that nightmare

1920
01:40:44,416 --> 01:40:44,928
Hellscape

1921
01:40:45,184 --> 01:40:46,720
Edwin cyrusone

1922
01:40:46,976 --> 01:40:50,816
Prayer you open the door

1923
01:40:51,072 --> 01:40:57,216
This room that's decorated really serenely you know like it has a real ethereal spiritual quality

1924
01:40:57,472 --> 01:41:02,592
But people are just screaming at you it's not like prayer it's really angry prayer

1925
01:41:07,712 --> 01:41:12,320
Happy

1926
01:41:12,576 --> 01:41:13,600
No one's fighting

1927
01:41:14,112 --> 01:41:15,136
They're still just

1928
01:41:16,928 --> 01:41:23,072
This fight is going to be that never happened never happened

1929
01:41:23,328 --> 01:41:24,608
You keep going then there's the crying

1930
01:41:24,864 --> 01:41:30,752
Because I thought are straight-up

1931
01:41:31,008 --> 01:41:32,288
Faking crying

1932
01:41:32,544 --> 01:41:33,568
Everyone's trying to

1933
01:41:33,824 --> 01:41:35,104
Experience and emotion in the

1934
01:41:35,360 --> 01:41:36,640
Really overdoing it

1935
01:41:36,896 --> 01:41:39,712
This is very annoying room and Alex

1936
01:41:39,968 --> 01:41:40,736
Proceed through that

1937
01:41:41,248 --> 01:41:42,016
Murder

1938
01:41:42,272 --> 01:41:43,296
Murder room

1939
01:41:43,552 --> 01:41:44,832
You going to the next room and it's just

1940
01:41:45,088 --> 01:41:45,600
Murdertown

1941
01:41:45,856 --> 01:41:51,488
Don't go into the fourth room pretending was technically not insult

1942
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:55,328
It's just him laying over a dead body

1943
01:41:57,120 --> 01:41:58,144
You make me kill this

1944
01:41:59,168 --> 01:41:59,936
I'm not responsible

1945
01:42:03,776 --> 01:42:05,568
This Is Us

1946
01:42:05,824 --> 01:42:08,128
What's playing out on this road

1947
01:42:08,640 --> 01:42:09,152
Nuts

1948
01:42:12,224 --> 01:42:16,832
Gavin not playing ball with Alex's wanting to be his dad like

1949
01:42:17,344 --> 01:42:18,368
It is a thing where it's like

1950
01:42:18,880 --> 01:42:24,000
Through this I can help you with nowhere to go I know what to do just listen to me

1951
01:42:24,256 --> 01:42:25,024
I'm done

1952
01:42:26,048 --> 01:42:28,608
But now I got to go

1953
01:42:29,632 --> 01:42:31,424
That's me

1954
01:42:31,680 --> 01:42:32,448
It does

1955
01:42:33,216 --> 01:42:34,752
It does seem like a come

1956
01:42:35,008 --> 01:42:35,520
Sleep

1957
01:42:36,544 --> 01:42:39,872
What I mean yeah you're right it's 100% of reaction to that

1958
01:42:40,128 --> 01:42:41,408
Particular type of Stonewall

1959
01:42:41,664 --> 01:42:42,944
From somebody who Alex

1960
01:42:43,200 --> 01:42:44,224
Respect

1961
01:42:44,480 --> 01:42:45,504
Like a truly

1962
01:42:47,296 --> 01:42:48,064
Just feel like

1963
01:42:48,320 --> 01:42:48,832
See that

1964
01:42:49,344 --> 01:42:50,880
Inability to directly

1965
01:42:51,136 --> 01:42:51,904
Attack gas

1966
01:42:52,416 --> 01:42:55,232
Is why we're going through all of these different

1967
01:42:55,488 --> 01:42:56,768
Cuz if it was somebody who was

1968
01:42:58,816 --> 01:42:59,328
Some other

1969
01:42:59,584 --> 01:43:00,096
That you know

1970
01:43:00,352 --> 01:43:01,888
He would just start going after the

1971
01:43:05,728 --> 01:43:06,240
Well

1972
01:43:06,496 --> 01:43:08,800
I don't know he did do that sort of

1973
01:43:16,992 --> 01:43:18,016
Gavin has a friend

1974
01:43:18,272 --> 01:43:21,856
Exactly who keeps trying to find a different avenue to put on

1975
01:43:22,112 --> 01:43:23,136
Awful energy

1976
01:43:28,512 --> 01:43:31,840
Is Gavin is wanted to

1977
01:43:32,096 --> 01:43:32,608
If you like

1978
01:43:33,888 --> 01:43:35,424
Close to mainstream

1979
01:43:35,680 --> 01:43:36,448
Lucky's on Main Street

1980
01:43:37,984 --> 01:43:41,312
People who Alex still has access to

1981
01:43:41,568 --> 01:43:42,848
Maybe be an ally

1982
01:43:43,360 --> 01:43:44,384
Milos

1983
01:43:44,640 --> 01:43:45,152
Pathetic

1984
01:43:45,408 --> 01:43:47,968
Alex is going to go out of his way to

1985
01:43:48,224 --> 01:43:49,504
Train Court Milos

1986
01:43:50,784 --> 01:43:51,296
Juice

1987
01:43:51,552 --> 01:43:54,112
Show are like

1988
01:43:55,136 --> 01:43:55,904
Rapoport

1989
01:43:56,160 --> 01:43:57,184
Anthony cumia

1990
01:44:01,280 --> 01:44:03,072
Exactly

1991
01:44:03,328 --> 01:44:04,864
You know like these these people

1992
01:44:06,912 --> 01:44:08,192
The 4th hour

1993
01:44:08,704 --> 01:44:11,008
Is hosted by Hagmann and Hagmann

1994
01:44:11,264 --> 01:44:13,056
From The Hagmann Report

1995
01:44:14,848 --> 01:44:15,360
So

1996
01:44:15,616 --> 01:44:17,408
Doug Hagmann and

1997
01:44:18,176 --> 01:44:18,688
Remember his first name

1998
01:44:20,992 --> 01:44:24,832
Fun little trivia about Doug Hagmann and Hagmann

1999
01:44:25,344 --> 01:44:26,368
They have this show

2000
01:44:27,136 --> 01:44:28,672
Frequency that show

2001
01:44:29,440 --> 01:44:32,768
Coach Dave daubenmeyer

2002
01:44:33,536 --> 01:44:35,328
Six Degrees of Separation

2003
01:44:36,608 --> 01:44:38,144
Been on

2004
01:44:38,400 --> 01:44:39,168
Coach Dave show

2005
01:44:39,680 --> 01:44:41,216
It's all very very

2006
01:44:41,472 --> 01:44:41,984
Closely

2007
01:44:45,056 --> 01:44:49,408
Almost like there's a shadow

2008
01:44:49,920 --> 01:44:56,064
Anthony Taylor shows a shadowy cabal

2009
01:44:56,320 --> 01:44:57,088
More of like a

2010
01:44:58,368 --> 01:45:00,160
Multi-level marketing

2011
01:45:02,464 --> 01:45:04,000
Clip lamp

2012
01:45:05,024 --> 01:45:06,816
We already heard Alex say

2013
01:45:07,072 --> 01:45:07,840
That he believes

2014
01:45:08,352 --> 01:45:09,376
Gavin McInnes

2015
01:45:09,632 --> 01:45:10,656
To be the White mart

2016
01:45:10,912 --> 01:45:11,424
Luther King

2017
01:45:11,936 --> 01:45:13,984
And we get to this next clip and this is

2018
01:45:14,240 --> 01:45:19,360
When Alex is sort of let the demons reseed themselves in their head

2019
01:45:19,616 --> 01:45:20,896
A normal conversation

2020
01:45:21,408 --> 01:45:23,200
And

2021
01:45:23,456 --> 01:45:24,224
Really f****** s***

2022
01:45:24,480 --> 01:45:25,248
About the Civil Rights

2023
01:45:25,760 --> 01:45:31,136
No I think it goes back to the Freedom Riders

2024
01:45:31,648 --> 01:45:33,184
The real quick what he's talking about is like

2025
01:45:33,440 --> 01:45:37,536
These people are trying to latch onto that idea

2026
01:45:38,048 --> 01:45:38,560
They're doing

2027
01:45:39,840 --> 01:45:40,352
Freedom Riders

2028
01:45:40,608 --> 01:45:41,376
The Freedom Writers

2029
01:45:41,632 --> 01:45:42,144
Of course

2030
01:45:42,400 --> 01:45:43,936
They want to be like because there

2031
01:45:44,192 --> 01:45:46,240
Cool

2032
01:45:47,520 --> 01:45:52,640
It was cool of them to go to the segregated South with blacks and whites and get the key

2033
01:46:05,952 --> 01:46:12,096
That was incredibly cool sorry

2034
01:46:15,424 --> 01:46:15,936
So

2035
01:46:16,448 --> 01:46:17,472
This is a mess

2036
01:46:18,496 --> 01:46:21,056
It is complete lunacy

2037
01:46:23,104 --> 01:46:23,616
Quito composite

2038
01:46:23,872 --> 01:46:24,640
Literally about the freedom

2039
01:46:25,152 --> 01:46:25,920
Because

2040
01:46:26,176 --> 01:46:27,712
Story of the Freedom Writers

2041
01:46:27,968 --> 01:46:30,784
Strongly undercuts the entire idea of states rights

2042
01:46:32,064 --> 01:46:34,112
The reason that the Freedom Riders had to

2043
01:46:34,368 --> 01:46:38,976
To do what they did was because the southern states were engaging. Enforcement of Supreme Court

2044
01:46:40,512 --> 01:46:41,280
Publix

2045
01:46:41,536 --> 01:46:42,816
Like bosses were unconscious

2046
01:46:43,840 --> 01:46:45,376
In response people challenges

2047
01:46:45,888 --> 01:46:47,680
Aggregation

2048
01:46:49,216 --> 01:46:52,800
They brought attention to the reality that the larger public didn't want us to

2049
01:46:53,312 --> 01:46:54,080
And because of their Acts

2050
01:46:54,592 --> 01:46:58,688
The argument that the Civil Rights Movement was make it with immeasurable strength

2051
01:46:59,200 --> 01:47:00,992
They showed specifically and clearly

2052
01:47:01,248 --> 01:47:04,832
How violence is being used to uphold the system of segregation

2053
01:47:05,088 --> 01:47:06,624
Of the passage of the Civil Rights

2054
01:47:07,392 --> 01:47:07,904
Few years later

2055
01:47:08,416 --> 01:47:11,232
Alex and literally everyone whose inspired is passively

2056
01:47:11,488 --> 01:47:12,512
Hate the Civil Rights

2057
01:47:13,280 --> 01:47:14,048
And the thing is

2058
01:47:14,560 --> 01:47:16,352
Civil Rights Act

2059
01:47:16,864 --> 01:47:19,168
Because the argument

2060
01:47:19,424 --> 01:47:21,216
Ignore rules about human

2061
01:47:21,984 --> 01:47:24,800
Is Alex and Gavin McGinnis were around in 1961

2062
01:47:25,056 --> 01:47:28,384
Alex would've been on the radio yelling about how the Freedom Riders were agitators

2063
01:47:28,640 --> 01:47:29,920
Who does hate white men

2064
01:47:30,176 --> 01:47:32,992
And how the Congress of racial equality was funded by Soros

2065
01:47:33,504 --> 01:47:36,832
Gavin McInnes will be leaving group The Proud boys to intimidate the Riders

2066
01:47:37,088 --> 01:47:38,624
And accepting the status quo

2067
01:47:39,136 --> 01:47:41,696
Which incidentally is exactly what the Klu Klux Klan did.

2068
01:47:42,720 --> 01:47:44,768
That's what they would have been doing in that sir

2069
01:47:45,536 --> 01:47:46,816
There's no doubt about it

2070
01:47:47,072 --> 01:47:49,376
Now if you want to say that some of these people who are

2071
01:47:49,632 --> 01:47:50,144
No

2072
01:47:50,400 --> 01:47:51,168
Protesting

2073
01:47:51,424 --> 01:47:53,216
54 equal rights

2074
01:47:56,032 --> 01:47:57,568
Maybe some of them were doing it to put it on it

2075
01:47:57,824 --> 01:47:58,336
Instagram

2076
01:47:58,592 --> 01:47:59,104
Sure

2077
01:47:59,616 --> 01:48:00,128
Who gives a

2078
01:48:01,152 --> 01:48:01,664
Who gives a

2079
01:48:02,688 --> 01:48:05,504
Undercut the point of the earth approach

2080
01:48:05,760 --> 01:48:07,040
Or anything like that

2081
01:48:07,552 --> 01:48:10,624
You want to say that some people are posers

2082
01:48:11,136 --> 01:48:12,416
You guys know who cares

2083
01:48:12,672 --> 01:48:14,976
That argument doesn't hold water it doesn't mean

2084
01:48:15,488 --> 01:48:17,792
What does mean something is what's behind

2085
01:48:19,328 --> 01:48:19,840
The facts

2086
01:48:20,352 --> 01:48:22,656
And the principles that Alex Jones again and again

2087
01:48:23,168 --> 01:48:25,472
The world's very clearly mirror

2088
01:48:25,728 --> 01:48:26,240
People who were

2089
01:48:26,496 --> 01:48:28,288
Against the Freedom Riders in 90

2090
01:48:28,800 --> 01:48:30,848
61 series no way away from

2091
01:48:31,104 --> 01:48:32,128
And the fact that Alex's

2092
01:48:32,384 --> 01:48:33,408
Intellectual predecessor

2093
01:48:33,920 --> 01:48:35,456
The people he cites

2094
01:48:35,712 --> 01:48:36,992
Operation for the path you took in life

2095
01:48:39,808 --> 01:48:40,320
In the sixties

2096
01:48:41,344 --> 01:48:43,136
It is I hear s*** like this

2097
01:48:44,672 --> 01:48:45,696
This isn't this is like

2098
01:48:47,488 --> 01:48:48,256
The

2099
01:48:48,512 --> 01:48:50,304
The positive history of

2100
01:48:50,816 --> 01:48:51,840
Without having to

2101
01:48:53,120 --> 01:48:53,632
Live a life

2102
01:48:54,144 --> 01:48:54,912
In accordance with the

2103
01:48:58,496 --> 01:48:59,520
It's a bummer

2104
01:49:01,312 --> 01:49:03,104
In every possible way

2105
01:49:03,360 --> 01:49:03,872
It is

2106
01:49:05,920 --> 01:49:07,456
To the Freedom Riders like

2107
01:49:08,480 --> 01:49:08,992
Really

2108
01:49:09,248 --> 01:49:15,392
That's your adjectives for the Freedom Writers

2109
01:49:17,184 --> 01:49:21,792
You know what I think of when I think of the Freedom Riders very cool cool legal

2110
01:49:22,048 --> 01:49:24,608
Ivan capucci the dog

2111
01:49:24,864 --> 01:49:26,656
Spuds MacKenzie

2112
01:49:26,912 --> 01:49:27,424
What the

2113
01:49:27,680 --> 01:49:29,216
Are you at 7

2114
01:49:32,544 --> 01:49:33,824
You can't be the Freedom Writers

2115
01:49:34,336 --> 01:49:35,360
Because racism

2116
01:49:35,616 --> 01:49:39,968
Over so we live in a post-racial Bubba

2117
01:49:40,224 --> 01:49:41,760
Like even the water

2118
01:49:42,016 --> 01:49:43,552
People during the Civil Rights era

2119
01:49:43,808 --> 01:49:45,600
Words to even the ones who were like

2120
01:49:45,856 --> 01:49:46,880
Hey we don't need to

2121
01:49:47,392 --> 01:49:48,160
Kill black people

2122
01:49:48,672 --> 01:49:50,464
There there was like

2123
01:49:50,720 --> 01:49:52,768
Why are you against this racism so

2124
01:49:53,280 --> 01:49:54,048
Segregation

2125
01:49:54,560 --> 01:49:55,328
Now we don't have to

2126
01:49:55,584 --> 01:49:56,096
To deal with it

2127
01:49:56,352 --> 01:49:57,376
Racism is over

2128
01:49:57,888 --> 01:50:03,776
We will you guys want to be the Civil Rights North vs South

2129
01:50:04,032 --> 01:50:05,312
Slavery's over guys

2130
01:50:05,568 --> 01:50:07,616
You can't be as cool as the f******

2131
01:50:08,384 --> 01:50:09,664
Civil War let's go

2132
01:50:09,920 --> 01:50:12,480
Who wants to make the argument

2133
01:50:12,736 --> 01:50:13,248
The progress is

2134
01:50:14,016 --> 01:50:15,040
The meaning for progress

2135
01:50:18,368 --> 01:50:19,904
But we're like a generation

2136
01:50:20,160 --> 01:50:20,672
Or maybe

2137
01:50:22,720 --> 01:50:23,488
Funeral expense

2138
01:50:23,744 --> 01:50:25,024
Riders time

2139
01:50:26,816 --> 01:50:27,840
After record

2140
01:50:28,864 --> 01:50:30,656
No matter what kind of a s******* you are

2141
01:50:30,912 --> 01:50:32,192
If you want to live in reality

2142
01:50:32,448 --> 01:50:33,728
You do have to recognize

2143
01:50:35,008 --> 01:50:35,520
Right

2144
01:50:35,776 --> 01:50:38,336
In terms of owning Capital owning property

2145
01:50:38,592 --> 01:50:39,360
Those are two things

2146
01:50:39,616 --> 01:50:40,896
Reply to

2147
01:50:41,152 --> 01:50:41,920
Minorities

2148
01:50:42,688 --> 01:50:43,200
In that time

2149
01:50:43,456 --> 01:50:43,968
Especially

2150
01:50:45,760 --> 01:50:48,064
You have to recognize that that still exist

2151
01:50:48,576 --> 01:50:50,624
The effects of that lingering to the

2152
01:50:50,880 --> 01:50:52,672
And if you reject that

2153
01:50:53,184 --> 01:50:54,720
But you're not living in reality

2154
01:50:54,976 --> 01:50:55,488
I mean it

2155
01:50:57,280 --> 01:51:02,656
Hey let's let's say that we're moving past the Freedom Writers or whatever so that the whole thing is done

2156
01:51:03,168 --> 01:51:04,192
When did

2157
01:51:05,472 --> 01:51:05,984
Official

2158
01:51:06,240 --> 01:51:08,032
Federal policy of Redline

2159
01:51:10,592 --> 01:51:11,872
Long long after that

2160
01:51:12,384 --> 01:51:14,176
But it's not eat we're not even talkin about

2161
01:51:18,272 --> 01:51:20,064
Stuff that has been going on

2162
01:51:20,320 --> 01:51:22,112
Still going on in order to find

2163
01:51:24,928 --> 01:51:26,464
Great so

2164
01:51:26,720 --> 01:51:28,256
The races were like fine

2165
01:51:29,024 --> 01:51:29,536
You off the bus

2166
01:51:30,048 --> 01:51:31,072
You're not allowed to live here

2167
01:51:32,096 --> 01:51:33,120
You're not allowed to own this

2168
01:51:33,376 --> 01:51:33,888
That or that

2169
01:51:34,144 --> 01:51:36,192
Turn our president was actively involved

2170
01:51:38,240 --> 01:51:39,008
But he was a real

2171
01:51:40,800 --> 01:51:41,312
Yep

2172
01:51:43,104 --> 01:51:44,896
Alright so good

2173
01:51:45,152 --> 01:51:49,504
No no no come on come on totally cool

2174
01:51:50,016 --> 01:51:52,832
He just doesn't want him to exist

2175
01:51:54,880 --> 01:51:56,928
But it's good that we live in a post

2176
01:51:57,696 --> 01:51:58,464
We're all over

2177
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:01,792
You can't be a freedom rider anymore

2178
01:52:02,048 --> 01:52:02,816
What are you fighting

2179
01:52:03,584 --> 01:52:04,608
There's just nothing to fight again

2180
01:52:08,448 --> 01:52:09,728
Present-day episode

2181
01:52:09,984 --> 01:52:11,264
Interesting couple days

2182
01:52:13,824 --> 01:52:14,336
I think

2183
01:52:14,592 --> 01:52:16,384
In terms of a Gavin McInnes

2184
01:52:16,640 --> 01:52:18,688
If you're in that is about as painless as

2185
01:52:19,200 --> 01:52:19,712
Yeah

2186
01:52:20,992 --> 01:52:24,576
Cut out a lot of him just saying stupid stuff because I think the broader picture

2187
01:52:24,832 --> 01:52:27,136
Of Alex really trying to have him up at

2188
01:52:27,904 --> 01:52:28,672
No yeah

2189
01:52:28,928 --> 01:52:29,952
Alex freaking out about it

2190
01:52:30,464 --> 01:52:32,512
Is much more important I think that's the real story

2191
01:52:33,280 --> 01:52:34,304
Is it Alex's still transfer

2192
01:52:34,560 --> 01:52:35,328
Recruit allies

2193
01:52:39,168 --> 01:52:39,680
Struggle

2194
01:52:39,936 --> 01:52:40,704
And Gavin is

2195
01:52:40,960 --> 01:52:41,472
Is pretty much

2196
01:52:41,984 --> 01:52:42,752
Doesn't really want

2197
01:52:44,288 --> 01:52:45,056
Get in the water and Alex

2198
01:52:50,432 --> 01:52:51,968
I mean it's like if they can

2199
01:52:52,992 --> 01:52:55,296
You know if they can beat this guy that I

2200
01:52:55,552 --> 01:52:57,344
Admire or respect

2201
01:52:57,600 --> 01:52:58,368
What is an elder

2202
01:53:01,184 --> 01:53:01,952
They can beat me

2203
01:53:02,464 --> 01:53:04,512
So I have to make sure he's not beating

2204
01:53:05,024 --> 01:53:05,792
Otherwise

2205
01:53:06,048 --> 01:53:07,328
I'm going to have to

2206
01:53:07,840 --> 01:53:08,608
To myself

2207
01:53:09,120 --> 01:53:10,656
What everybody else already knows

2208
01:53:11,168 --> 01:53:12,192
Which is that I am beat

2209
01:53:12,960 --> 01:53:14,496
The writing is on the wall

2210
01:53:19,616 --> 01:53:20,128
A massive

2211
01:53:24,736 --> 01:53:27,552
I should say that

2212
01:53:27,808 --> 01:53:33,184
A reminder

2213
01:53:33,696 --> 01:53:34,464
Eviction

2214
01:53:36,256 --> 01:53:37,024
You know the work is

2215
01:53:37,280 --> 01:53:38,048
Finding

2216
01:53:38,560 --> 01:53:39,840
Something interesting to talk about 41

2217
01:53:40,608 --> 01:53:41,888
Going into the past for Monday

2218
01:53:44,704 --> 01:53:46,496
The present stuff is what I dread the most

2219
01:53:47,008 --> 01:53:48,032
Because I know it's

2220
01:53:48,800 --> 01:53:49,312
The hours of

2221
01:53:52,896 --> 01:53:53,408
You listen to

2222
01:53:53,664 --> 01:53:54,176
22 hours

2223
01:53:54,432 --> 01:53:56,480
And then he'll lie about the boy scout

2224
01:54:00,064 --> 01:54:01,856
If that's not how I want to live my life

2225
01:54:02,624 --> 01:54:04,672
The present episode suck

2226
01:54:05,184 --> 01:54:05,696
In the hit show

2227
01:54:05,952 --> 01:54:06,976
They're stupid

2228
01:54:07,744 --> 01:54:08,256
I look forward to it

2229
01:54:16,448 --> 01:54:16,960
Block Rockin Beats

2230
01:54:17,472 --> 01:54:17,984
Is rhetoric

2231
01:54:18,240 --> 01:54:24,384
But we have a website

2232
01:54:25,920 --> 01:54:32,064
Ostroukhova kicked off on the Facebook

2233
01:54:33,344 --> 01:54:39,232
Reviews are important and also it's like

2234
01:54:39,488 --> 01:54:41,024
They don't count listen

2235
01:54:41,280 --> 01:54:41,792
This much

2236
01:54:42,304 --> 01:54:43,328
As they do download

2237
01:54:43,840 --> 01:54:45,376
I don't know I don't put it like that

2238
01:54:45,632 --> 01:54:46,144
I don't know

2239
01:54:50,496 --> 01:54:51,264
Stuff I don't know how I

2240
01:54:52,800 --> 01:54:53,312
I don't ever

2241
01:54:53,568 --> 01:54:54,848
Expect

2242
01:54:56,640 --> 01:55:02,784
What are the number one Alex Jones podcast

2243
01:55:03,040 --> 01:55:03,808
No.

2244
01:55:04,064 --> 01:55:05,344
Whether or not

2245
01:55:05,856 --> 01:55:06,368
So the goddamn

2246
01:55:07,136 --> 01:55:07,648
That's what you

2247
01:55:07,904 --> 01:55:09,184
Tracking

2248
01:55:12,256 --> 01:55:13,536
We working on

2249
01:55:13,792 --> 01:55:16,608
Making sure they never have tracking for that

2250
01:55:18,656 --> 01:55:20,704
What else we got

2251
01:55:20,960 --> 01:55:21,984
Well I mean

2252
01:55:22,496 --> 01:55:23,008
Gavin

2253
01:55:24,544 --> 01:55:26,080
Almost certainly been

2254
01:55:26,336 --> 01:55:26,848
At least

2255
01:55:27,360 --> 01:55:28,384
The inspiration

2256
01:55:31,200 --> 01:55:31,712
Maybe

2257
01:55:34,272 --> 01:55:35,040
Command

2258
01:55:35,808 --> 01:55:36,832
You can't prove

2259
01:55:37,088 --> 01:55:37,600
Anyting

2260
01:55:38,368 --> 01:55:40,416
Oh wait I thought you were going to accuse him of

2261
01:55:42,720 --> 01:55:48,864
He probably hasn't killed in Hollywood

2262
01:55:52,960 --> 01:55:53,472
But

2263
01:55:53,728 --> 01:55:54,496
One guy text

2264
01:55:55,008 --> 01:55:55,520
He probably has

2265
01:55:55,776 --> 01:55:56,544
That is

2266
01:55:58,080 --> 01:56:00,128
