1
00:00:04,096 --> 00:00:07,680
Alexandra first in color with huge fan I love your work

2
00:00:07,936 --> 00:00:14,080
Hey everybody

3
00:00:14,592 --> 00:00:18,688
Yes sir I

4
00:00:19,456 --> 00:00:22,272
Play Super Mario RPG

5
00:00:25,088 --> 00:00:31,232
I know it's Super Mario

6
00:00:31,488 --> 00:00:33,792
Dear door

7
00:00:34,048 --> 00:00:40,192
I don't remember Paper Mario

8
00:00:40,704 --> 00:00:43,264
You I don't know

9
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,592
Oh really are fun as hell.

10
00:00:47,104 --> 00:00:53,248
Fell apart

11
00:00:53,504 --> 00:00:57,856
The crumpled up and thrown in the garbage

12
00:00:58,112 --> 00:01:04,256
It was just not all that fun

13
00:01:04,512 --> 00:01:07,072
Color the world

14
00:01:07,584 --> 00:01:08,608
It just was not

15
00:01:13,728 --> 00:01:15,776
It was really good liked it alot

16
00:01:16,544 --> 00:01:19,616
I don't know what else do you like to do I heard good things

17
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:26,016
Play that game like 15 times and I

18
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:31,136
There's the awesome Games Done Quick Marathon going on right now

19
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:37,536
It's like a massive either unkind of me it's all about donations to

20
00:01:38,048 --> 00:01:39,584
Nonprofit in the

21
00:01:40,096 --> 00:01:41,888
Sites that does all cancer

22
00:01:42,656 --> 00:01:48,800
Like that and I love that game so much and I found out that somebody was speedrunning

23
00:01:49,056 --> 00:01:49,824
And I was like

24
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:52,128
I've been watching

25
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:54,944
I've literally been watching a guy play

26
00:01:55,456 --> 00:01:57,248
Super Mario for the past 2 hours

27
00:01:57,504 --> 00:02:03,648
Go to the game that I was okay at

28
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:10,048
There's something gratifying something you play very sad

29
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:13,888
Reflect on that

30
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:18,752
Before the show started playing Hollow Knight

31
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:20,288
For the recommendation on that one

32
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,080
I like it

33
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:28,480
I'm not good at it end up wandering around places for a good 20

34
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:31,808
Supposed to go

35
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:32,832
Turn the music up

36
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:33,856
Just delightful

37
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:35,136
Gameplay fun

38
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:42,048
Video game podcast

39
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:51,520
Correct Cooper episode on Monday

40
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:57,920
Waterman not doctor Waterman

41
00:02:58,176 --> 00:02:58,688
Alex Jones

42
00:02:58,944 --> 00:03:00,736
And the world of Infowars

43
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:03,808
Be going over is a little bit of

44
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:07,136
Snapshot of the life

45
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:09,184
Of Alex Jones in 2018

46
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:13,024
There we go

47
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:16,608
We're going to be going over January 8th

48
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,168
Vat19

49
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,496
And then his live broadcast that he did that evening

50
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:28,384
When Trump was giving his speech from the Oval Office historically when we've gone over show

51
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,712
And then there's a live broadcast immediately after that

52
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:33,248
That light broadcast

53
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:34,784
Is drunken and angry

54
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:41,952
He seems a little drunk but don't get your hopes too far up on that it doesn't go for

55
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:43,488
But he is a little bit on

56
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,048
Then it'll be interesting to look at

57
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:47,328
We have to give a shout out

58
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:49,120
We would like to

59
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:50,144
Give a shout out

60
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,240
Do a couple people signed up and are supporting shall we appreciate it very much

61
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,312
I'd like to say.

62
00:03:57,568 --> 00:03:58,592
You are now a policy wonk

63
00:03:59,104 --> 00:04:05,248
I'm a policy wonk

64
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:06,016
Policy wonk

65
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:08,832
I'm a policy wonk

66
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:09,600
Next

67
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:10,624
Christopher

68
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:13,184
You are now a policy wonk

69
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:14,720
I'm a policy wonk

70
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:21,119
Christopher

71
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:24,447
I just came out that way and I apologize and thank you

72
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:28,287
Next

73
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:35,711
Bridget Bridget

74
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:39,807
I appreciate it though so very much

75
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:46,975
Don't get mad and tell your brother someone sodomites

76
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:00,543
Jesus

77
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:06,943
Thank you so much Ian if you're out there listening and you're thinking hey I'd like to support this show what these Gents

78
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:11,039
Acknowledge

79
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:13,087
Appreciate

80
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:13,855
Now

81
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:17,951
We get to our business at hand and one of the reasons why I was a little bit reluctant

82
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:19,231
To do any Alex Jones

83
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:20,255
This week

84
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:22,559
Was because they are

85
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:28,959
The 2009 stuff hit a little bit of a little bit of boredom on Alex's part back

86
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:31,263
Eventbrite

87
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:33,567
Want to get into that and then

88
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:34,847
There's all this talk

89
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:36,639
Trump's part

90
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:39,455
In that world that's pure

91
00:05:39,711 --> 00:05:40,991
About the idea of trump

92
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:42,783
Declaring a national emergency

93
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:47,647
In order to get the wall made out in a particular way

94
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:50,719
But I didn't know exactly how it was going to play out

95
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:53,791
I kind of got the sense that all of this was Much Ado About Nothing

96
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:55,839
People getting all worked up in

97
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:57,119
Who's going to be

98
00:05:57,887 --> 00:05:59,679
You know kind of disappointed

99
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:05,311
Since I got but I didn't want to cover it until we actually had content to go over

100
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:08,639
And so January 8th is Tuesday shows no a week

101
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:13,247
Done that before this episode

102
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:14,271
I found out

103
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:16,319
F***** up

104
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:18,111
This mood is

105
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:22,719
Pretty f***** up to be to be seeing this

106
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:24,255
All that

107
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:25,023
The first years now.

108
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:26,047
Text Rob from

109
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:31,423
Gavin Newsom ladies and gentlemen you better believe is it

110
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:35,263
He is the devil

111
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:41,663
Read message

112
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:42,943
Yeah

113
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:45,247
Music is the great Satan

114
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:53,695
I wouldn't bet on you know what that's a good but now that I think about it

115
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:58,047
What respect is reasoning is that he's flick

116
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:01,631
Comer in the Democratic world

117
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:03,423
She's going to be the one

118
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:04,191
Trump with

119
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:10,847
And so that's why he's labeling the devil

120
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:16,991
Like I said

121
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:18,783
He knows the Trump is going

122
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:19,551
Going to be giving us

123
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:20,319
Speech that night

124
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:23,391
First clip you start to show

125
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:25,439
Very clearly indicate

126
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:27,231
He knows what he's going to do

127
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:40,799
Privately and the globalist

128
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:43,871
Are crapping themselves both publicly but also the look

129
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:45,151
On their faces

130
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:47,711
Set up beforehand

131
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:49,759
Sorry Squad

132
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:56,927
Subway news today

133
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:01,535
He is making it very clear

134
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:04,351
The Trump is going to declare a state of emergency

135
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:05,119
But he knows it

136
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:08,959
Seems already tonight

137
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:10,239
All the globalist

138
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:11,263
Crapping themselves

139
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:12,287
Alex

140
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:14,591
Now there's some contradict

141
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:19,455
Historic rhetoric.

142
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:23,551
I want I want us to put a pin in that until we get through

143
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:25,599
Because I

144
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:27,647
We can have about that later

145
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:29,951
Disservice

146
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:33,023
Jump the gun on it but it was listening

147
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:39,423
We are not not notice until it's very obvious

148
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:44,287
To be excited about a president declared a national emergency

149
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:45,311
Is

150
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:47,615
Super excited

151
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:54,015
United States

152
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:55,551
Other branches of government

153
00:08:55,807 --> 00:09:00,159
Unilateral action

154
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:01,951
It seems it seems like

155
00:09:02,207 --> 00:09:08,095
Counter to a lot of his beliefs about the power of the executive

156
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:10,911
You should understand that it's coming from

157
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:11,679
A deep

158
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:14,239
Place in Alex's

159
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:18,335
The end of his personal struggle

160
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:19,871
The end of this turmoil

161
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:20,639
His battle

162
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:24,479
In many ways I believe listening to

163
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:25,503
That wants to

164
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:27,039
Where's the state of emergency

165
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:31,903
It's game over for the globalism and finally Alex Jones

166
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:34,719
Not have to do this

167
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:37,023
Here is eclipse

168
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:38,815
Really leave me towards that

169
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:41,375
The joy is a God-fearing person

170
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:45,215
Smiling over

171
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:51,103
Closer to God

172
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:52,895
He's crazy

173
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:54,431
Now we just think you're weird

174
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:59,807
Increase for myself

175
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:02,111
Intellectually what I understand is just

176
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:05,183
Little shells

177
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:07,743
Good job

178
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:17,983
Because there's been a total shift just the last month

179
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:20,287
You talk about bolsonaro

180
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:25,407
Talked about everything we've done

181
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:33,343
Has a choice

182
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:36,927
Of what decision I want to make to be seduced by the globalist

183
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:39,743
By the high-tech

184
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:42,047
But War.

185
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:43,583
I didn't know the Antichrist

186
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:50,495
Thunder

187
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:55,103
Like a gopher

188
00:10:58,943 --> 00:10:59,455
This

189
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:00,479
Pretty f*****-up

190
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:02,015
It feels a little apocalyptic

191
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:07,135
It feels like you saying we're getting our bearings together

192
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:11,231
For what will be the grand final battle between us and the globalist

193
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:14,047
And the people who are on our side or people like

194
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:16,351
Bolsonaro in Brazil

195
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:17,375
It's it's

196
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:18,399
Weird

197
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:19,679
A little weird

198
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:20,959
For me quite frankly

199
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:24,799
To come to this place

200
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:27,359
Having as much of an understanding of Alex's

201
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:29,407
Look at all my

202
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:31,199
So weird

203
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:32,735
If this is how

204
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:33,759
It's shaken out

205
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:35,039
It disappoint

206
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:42,207
Really really bad especially with bolsonaro having

207
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:47,071
It's really

208
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:49,887
Something that everybody should be aware of

209
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:56,543
Right now bolsonaro is going to do more damage to the climate than I think any single person

210
00:11:56,799 --> 00:12:00,127
Possibly

211
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:01,407
Well once he

212
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:04,735
Declares open season on the Brazilian Rainforest

213
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:06,271
Being cut down

214
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:08,831
Werefox

215
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:11,135
It's a very on

216
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:12,159
Undoable

217
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:15,743
Yeah that's concerned

218
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:17,023
Human rights question

219
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:17,791
Windsor

220
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:18,559
Deeply in Ford

221
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:20,351
It's the pits

222
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:22,399
It's wild

223
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:27,007
Battle

224
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:36,991
What you failing to recognize

225
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:38,783
That when you look at the conception of

226
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:39,551
It's final.

227
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:41,087
Envisioning

228
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:42,367
Is it no matter what happens

229
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:45,183
Really

230
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:46,463
What if he loses

231
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:50,303
Declared a national emergency

232
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:54,143
Bargaining chip

233
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:57,471
What I want

234
00:12:57,727 --> 00:13:01,055
The wall

235
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:03,359
Emergency

236
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:08,479
Launch launch

237
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:14,367
Glacier Skyward salad

238
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:17,951
Either way Trump wins

239
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:23,839
And sued for peace 2 years ago anyone

240
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:35,103
What do you want me to still have your wealth and you still want to screw the country over because you got some spiritual

241
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:36,895
To defeat it

242
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:40,479
With the Devil

243
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:43,039
Trump

244
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:47,391
Don't understand

245
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:50,463
Exactly

246
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:53,023
What effect declaring a national emergency

247
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:54,047
Privately

248
00:13:55,327 --> 00:14:01,471
Well declare a National Emergency privately between you and Claire the power of

249
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:11,711
Yeah yeah

250
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:14,527
Qanon

251
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:20,159
To trying to convey

252
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:24,511
In order to drive

253
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:26,559
The Democrats to heal

254
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:27,583
Or whatever

255
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:29,119
And then when they don't you

256
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:30,399
He's going to tonight

257
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:31,935
On January 8th

258
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:36,031
Openly declared state of emergency be like I tried to let you guys

259
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:38,079
Just do this on your own

260
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:39,359
That's what he's

261
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:43,967
Build That Wall

262
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:46,015
He's going to

263
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:47,295
National Emergency

264
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:48,831
In order to build the wall in Alex's

265
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:49,599
Pumped about it

266
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:50,879
He loved it

267
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:57,279
Is is Alex super pumped about the years-long legal challenges that are going to come from

268
00:14:57,535 --> 00:15:03,679
From this National Emergency

269
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:13,151
I have a long history of being

270
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:15,967
Look this is all this is all wack

271
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:18,527
It's all very well

272
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:19,551
Is this

273
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:21,087
On this episode

274
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:25,183
This is not about politics

275
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:27,231
There's a deeply religious field

276
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:32,607
Whether it's talking about the sword of Armageddon

277
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:33,631
Air Force

278
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:36,703
Or this next clip where he just can't

279
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:37,471
Like

280
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:41,567
Stop quoting country songs in order to demonstrate how right

281
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:42,591
With God

282
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:44,895
The mentally ill narcissistic

283
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:48,223
Froot Loops

284
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:52,575
The fill their hand

285
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:58,975
Stand the fact that they can't make this run

286
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:00,255
Like the old

287
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:02,047
Redneck anthem

288
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:03,583
Country Boy Can Survive

289
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:05,887
Cuz they can't starve us out

290
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:08,447
Make a shrine

291
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:11,519
These old boys were raised with shotgun

292
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:14,847
We say grace we say Amen

293
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:17,663
And if you ain't into that we don't give a damn

294
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:20,223
Which is

295
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:26,879
We'll take the lord's name in vain

296
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:29,183
Not perfect

297
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:34,047
God

298
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:37,631
Shop equipment

299
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:41,727
Call wife

300
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:43,775
That's why I know that

301
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:48,127
Save a Horse Ride a Cowboy

302
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:52,991
Beer for My Horses

303
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:58,623
Yeah I just it's a weird mental state

304
00:16:58,879 --> 00:16:59,647
A little bit dumb

305
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:01,951
A little bit to demonstrate

306
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:03,999
He's in a very

307
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:06,047
A mindset that is

308
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:07,071
Tonight

309
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:08,351
It's going down

310
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:10,399
I got to talk about the end

311
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:11,679
Of the road

312
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:13,471
I got to talk about how right we are

313
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:17,823
God

314
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:18,847
But the amount of it

315
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:21,919
He's being very apocalyptic

316
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:28,063
The first half hour or so this show even

317
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:30,367
There is nothing here but preacher

318
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:36,511
Like this is almost a televangelist kind of thing

319
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:39,071
7 steel shelving

320
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:42,399
Broken

321
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:48,799
All the more scary that also includes

322
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:51,359
In fact I'm not scared of the Loveless

323
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:58,783
I'm scared of overheating and getting too aggressive

324
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:01,855
And just being as wise as a serpent peaceful to do

325
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:05,183
Goddess cubes Vengeance to wash

326
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:10,815
Time for vengeance is not yet

327
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:12,351
Thank God

328
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:13,375
What

329
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:15,167
Time of Vengeance will come

330
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:19,775
Vengeance is good

331
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:23,615
Saith the Lord it's mine

332
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:33,599
Quad

333
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:38,719
Soul

334
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:43,583
I guess

335
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:45,375
I don't like him

336
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:50,495
We come back up

337
00:18:50,751 --> 00:18:51,263
Good luck

338
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:54,335
Bucked up

339
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:55,103
Weird

340
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:59,455
Revengeance

341
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:01,503
But it doesn't

342
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:02,527
Is fast approaching

343
00:19:02,783 --> 00:19:06,111
It comes through and it will come through us

344
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:12,255
His righteousness

345
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:14,047
He's perceived

346
00:19:15,327 --> 00:19:17,119
You're not even real enemy

347
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:18,143
Quite frankly

348
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:21,727
Hillary Clinton speech

349
00:19:24,543 --> 00:19:29,151
Really wish somebody would get him a Bible with like large print so maybe you can read

350
00:19:29,663 --> 00:19:30,431
Cuz he seems

351
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:36,319
Very uninterested in what the Bible said I would love it if there was a Bible that was Rewritten

352
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:45,279
Then maybe he might start to get better

353
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:47,839
It does go back

354
00:19:48,095 --> 00:19:49,887
Do you like Alex has a very like

355
00:19:50,143 --> 00:19:50,655
Weird

356
00:19:50,911 --> 00:19:51,423
Version

357
00:19:52,703 --> 00:19:53,215
Drive to

358
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:55,007
I don't think it's fair to

359
00:19:55,263 --> 00:19:55,775
Call Main Street

360
00:19:56,543 --> 00:19:58,335
I also don't think it's fair to call it in

361
00:19:58,591 --> 00:20:00,127
But I'm really even

362
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:01,663
Leggett

363
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:04,223
Touches of gnosticism in there

364
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:06,271
There's touches of like overemphasis

365
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:07,295
The Old Testament

366
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:12,671
Which is no tragedy

367
00:20:12,927 --> 00:20:15,743
It's just weird if you're a Christian because of the new

368
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:20,863
Christian in your rice

369
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:22,399
It's strange

370
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:25,215
I don't I don't understand but it's it's a bad place

371
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:28,799
Alex announces

372
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:30,079
He's going to

374
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:33,663
Which at this point

375
00:20:34,175 --> 00:20:37,247
Clear any mix

376
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:38,783
He knows what's going to happen

377
00:20:39,551 --> 00:20:42,879
I mean the decision yesterday afternoon obviously we're going to

378
00:20:43,647 --> 00:20:44,927

Having problems

And also it's clear he saying it repeatedly we know this is going to happen

391
00:21:40,736 --> 00:21:41,504
Predicted

00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:44,064
Somebody who lives in tomorrow's news today

You're going to be real disappointed that

394
00:21:47,136 --> 00:21:50,976
Knowing what we know we know what happened

395
00:21:51,488 --> 00:21:53,024
It is important to focus on this

396
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,072
This is Alex's editorial position

397
00:21:55,328 --> 00:21:55,840
Entirely

398
00:21:56,096 --> 00:22:00,960
This is going to happen tonight we've predicted it absolutely going at

399
00:22:01,216 --> 00:22:02,240
We're going to be there covered

400
00:22:03,008 --> 00:22:05,824
Zoe starts yelling about the dumb s***

401
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:22,720
It's pretty obvious

402
00:22:29,632 --> 00:22:32,960
Yelp

403
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:40,896
Literally

404
00:22:41,408 --> 00:22:43,968
They don't just lie they organize the line

405
00:22:44,736 --> 00:22:49,856
They put out the talking points

406
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:53,440
Briefly Define

407
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:03,424
That are 50% off

408
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:09,824
Chris is the Christmas sale still going on 1000 Days of Christmas sale going on

409
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:16,224

00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:19,040
Stuffed it look beat the thing here is

411
00:23:19,296 --> 00:23:25,440
Tonight circuit that's an old backup situation

412
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:27,232
Was about Cinco de Mayo

413
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:32,096
Intentionally wearing American

414
00:23:32,352 --> 00:23:33,632
Can Flags in order to

415
00:23:35,424 --> 00:23:41,568
Recall exactly

416
00:23:41,824 --> 00:23:46,432
Who is Kaizo

417
00:23:46,688 --> 00:23:47,200
Spy fights

418
00:23:47,456 --> 00:23:48,736
Cathay Inn

419
00:23:48,992 --> 00:23:49,504
Instigate

420
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:52,064
The school has

421
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:52,832
Bi-Rite

422
00:23:54,624 --> 00:23:57,696
People to wear certain kind of flag

423
00:23:58,208 --> 00:23:58,976
On days like

424
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:01,536
It doesn't

425
00:24:01,792 --> 00:24:02,816
It doesn't

426
00:24:03,584 --> 00:24:04,096
Free speech

427
00:24:04,352 --> 00:24:05,376
Or

428
00:24:05,632 --> 00:24:06,400
Whatever other rights

429
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:09,728
It's exactly like saying you can't colors

430
00:24:09,984 --> 00:24:14,336
Like when you're when you're co-opting the American flag to be a group of people

431
00:24:14,592 --> 00:24:19,456
To commit violent

432
00:24:19,712 --> 00:24:21,248
It's not an outright

433
00:24:21,504 --> 00:24:23,040
Conflagration thing like this

434
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:24,832
Yeah that's the first thing

435
00:24:26,624 --> 00:24:27,136
Second

436
00:24:27,648 --> 00:24:28,160
You hear there is

437
00:24:28,416 --> 00:24:29,440
Alex demonizing

438
00:24:29,696 --> 00:24:30,208
Circuit

439
00:24:30,464 --> 00:24:30,976
With Ally

440
00:24:31,232 --> 00:24:32,000
Which is him

441
00:24:32,768 --> 00:24:33,536
Complaining about

442
00:24:33,792 --> 00:24:34,304
The Judiciary

443
00:24:34,816 --> 00:24:36,096
Complaining about the court

444
00:24:36,352 --> 00:24:37,632
And how they're really bad

445
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,680
Then he talks about the media

446
00:24:40,192 --> 00:24:41,728
And how the media is really bad

447
00:24:41,984 --> 00:24:44,544
Yeah hold on to those thoughts Hellboy

448
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:45,568
Come back on

449
00:24:45,824 --> 00:24:49,408
Start complaining about how Mark.

450
00:24:49,664 --> 00:24:52,224
Has been thrown off Facebook

451
00:24:56,064 --> 00:25:02,208
Like a petty little move there as its way down the

452
00:25:02,464 --> 00:25:08,608
Important

453
00:25:13,216 --> 00:25:17,568
Honestly I think it would happen

454
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:18,592
Is that

455
00:25:18,848 --> 00:25:21,152
If This falls in one of the every hour

456
00:25:21,408 --> 00:25:22,176
She has like five

457
00:25:22,432 --> 00:25:28,064
Minutes that don't go out on the radio

458
00:25:29,344 --> 00:25:35,488
With some Tuscaloosa Channel Loretta doesn't matter

459
00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:41,632
Reports their report by Mark.

460
00:25:41,888 --> 00:25:47,264
In one of those no-man's-land but it's really important and what's going on here

461
00:25:47,776 --> 00:25:48,800
Story behind it

462
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:50,592
Mark.

463
00:25:50,848 --> 00:25:51,360
Being a

464
00:25:53,408 --> 00:25:55,200
And you deserve everything that came to him

465
00:25:55,456 --> 00:25:58,016
Has David he got thrown off Facebook

466
00:25:58,272 --> 00:26:00,064
Because of something that was deemed

467
00:26:00,576 --> 00:26:01,856
Here's a little taste

468
00:26:02,112 --> 00:26:02,624
Of Mark Dice

469
00:26:03,136 --> 00:26:03,648
Report

470
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:16,192
Houston

471
00:26:25,408 --> 00:26:26,944
Girl

472
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:35,136
Antonio Brown

473
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:42,816
Sexually Jazmine Barnes

474
00:26:46,656 --> 00:26:50,752
Here's the thing

475
00:26:51,008 --> 00:26:53,824
Of Mark dice's report because why would I

476
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:54,592
Why would you

477
00:26:54,848 --> 00:26:57,664
Crazy man

478
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,200
His delivery is insane

479
00:26:59,456 --> 00:27:00,480
He looks like a lunatic

480
00:27:00,736 --> 00:27:02,016
You'd like constantly

481
00:27:02,272 --> 00:27:07,136
Like weird movement

482
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:10,208
We can just listening to the audio doesn't really do it service

483
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,256
Seems like a lunatic

484
00:27:12,512 --> 00:27:16,096
Aesthetic style that he's going for

485
00:27:16,352 --> 00:27:17,632
Maybe he knows that him just sitting

486
00:27:19,424 --> 00:27:19,936
Is it good

487
00:27:20,448 --> 00:27:23,776
YouTube something like that no one's going to be entertained by his dumb face

488
00:27:29,408 --> 00:27:32,992
I watched Mark Dice videos spice to say it deserves every label it's getting

489
00:27:33,248 --> 00:27:33,760
It is race

490
00:27:34,016 --> 00:27:35,040
It's inflammatory

491
00:27:35,552 --> 00:27:36,320
Pile of s***

492
00:27:36,576 --> 00:27:37,088
From quality

493
00:27:38,112 --> 00:27:41,184
Alex is playing a report saying that he's been kicked off Facebook

494
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:45,280
Mark just got suspended for a short time

495
00:27:45,536 --> 00:27:46,816
I just got a little time out

496
00:27:47,072 --> 00:27:47,840
So what I want to say

497
00:27:48,096 --> 00:27:50,912
These f****** snowflakes need to stop exaggerating the repression

498
00:27:51,168 --> 00:27:51,680
Number one

499
00:27:52,448 --> 00:27:53,728
He was a real point I wanted

500
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:55,520
Works Chief complaint

501
00:27:55,776 --> 00:27:56,288
Be that these

502
00:27:56,544 --> 00:28:00,896
Black lives matter sjw we're only interested in the story because they thought it was a chance

503
00:28:01,152 --> 00:28:01,664
To attack

504
00:28:02,176 --> 00:28:04,480
But the same is true of Mark Dice

505
00:28:04,736 --> 00:28:10,880
He's only interested in the story because it gives them an opportunity to defend white people and attack black people

506
00:28:11,136 --> 00:28:15,488
You understand that are you saying there's some sort of irony to it

507
00:28:15,744 --> 00:28:20,352
His only point is exactly what he's complaining about in these supposed other

508
00:28:21,376 --> 00:28:21,888
Just weird

509
00:28:22,144 --> 00:28:25,472
Seems like a bad starting point position but whatever

510
00:28:25,984 --> 00:28:26,496
Also

511
00:28:27,008 --> 00:28:29,568
An added problem is he has no idea what he's talking about

512
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:32,640
7 year old Jasmine Barnes was killed in a drive-by shooting

513
00:28:32,896 --> 00:28:36,224
And family initially said the suspect was a white man in a red truck

514
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:39,552
This turned out not to be accurate as first hand accounts off in Ark

515
00:28:39,808 --> 00:28:40,832
An official from the sheriff's

516
00:28:41,088 --> 00:28:44,416
Department of gone on record saying

517
00:28:44,672 --> 00:28:46,976
And this was a case of mistaken identity and

518
00:28:47,232 --> 00:28:47,744
It was nothing

519
00:28:48,512 --> 00:28:49,792
Also

520
00:28:50,048 --> 00:28:51,584
The Killing

521
00:28:52,096 --> 00:28:53,632
Also black lives matter activist

522
00:28:53,888 --> 00:28:55,424
Just blindly blame White

523
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:57,472
People don't forget the story when the narrative didn't

524
00:28:58,496 --> 00:29:00,032
That's what Infowars does

525
00:29:00,544 --> 00:29:06,688
In reality Shaun King one of the leading figures of the black lives matter movement is literally responsible for tipping

526
00:29:06,944 --> 00:29:12,064
Turn off the police that the shooters were Larry Woodruff and Eric black Junior not a white guy in a red truck

527
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:18,464
Because what I'm saying is that a prominent figure in the black lives matter movement went out of his way

528
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:22,048
Nerd help police find the actual Killers because he cared about the truth

529
00:29:22,304 --> 00:29:23,840
Not just scoring points making

530
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:25,888
I don't understand

531
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:32,544
No he stopped caring once they found it once

532
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:33,312
John King received

533
00:29:33,568 --> 00:29:35,616
The tip from one of his confidential source

534
00:29:38,432 --> 00:29:39,968
He found out that it was two black men

535
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:44,576
And so we have corset on it and never told anybody

536
00:29:44,832 --> 00:29:47,904
Complicated

537
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:50,976
Because after a mugshot was released of the original suspect

538
00:29:51,744 --> 00:29:55,328
Posted a picture of a mugshot

539
00:29:55,584 --> 00:29:56,864
And ask followers for Morgan

540
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:57,632
Information on

541
00:29:57,888 --> 00:29:58,400
If they had any

542
00:29:58,656 --> 00:30:00,960
There's absolutely led to some unmerited attention

543
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:02,752
Probable harassment

544
00:30:03,264 --> 00:30:03,776
Being played

545
00:30:05,056 --> 00:30:05,824
Directed towards

546
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:08,384
But it also literally led to the tip that solved

547
00:30:09,152 --> 00:30:10,432
As shown put it quote

548
00:30:10,688 --> 00:30:11,712
Estranged

549
00:30:11,968 --> 00:30:14,784
I'm not sure we ever would have found the man who killed Jasmine Barnes

550
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:17,344
Have the initial conclusion not been so wrong

551
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:20,160
I was brought into the case to track a potential hate crime

552
00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:22,464
Something altogether different

553
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:26,560
But I don't know that anyone would have ever come forward without the outrage

554
00:30:27,072 --> 00:30:29,888
I don't quite know what that means or how I feel about it

555
00:30:30,144 --> 00:30:31,168
But the initial outrage

556
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:34,496
Misguided as it was his what eventually helped us find

557
00:30:34,752 --> 00:30:35,264
The Killers

558
00:30:35,776 --> 00:30:36,288
So

559
00:30:36,544 --> 00:30:38,080
If you're a white supremacist Outlet like

560
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:40,384
Infowars Mark Dice of the Daily Caller

561
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,688
You can focus on the part where Sean initially post

562
00:30:42,944 --> 00:30:43,968
Send a picture of the wrong person

563
00:30:44,224 --> 00:30:44,992
I made a mistake

564
00:30:45,504 --> 00:30:50,624
Good faith and just ignore the later part where you followed through knowledge

565
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,160
Was inaccurate

566
00:30:52,672 --> 00:30:54,464
It's all the game these assholes are playing

567
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:56,000
They simply don't give a fuk

568
00:30:56,256 --> 00:30:57,024
About what's true

569
00:30:57,536 --> 00:30:58,048
And people didn't

570
00:30:58,304 --> 00:31:00,096
Forget about the story or the Tappan

571
00:31:00,352 --> 00:31:02,656
Funerals on Wednesday

572
00:31:02,912 --> 00:31:03,680
It was packed to the rafters

573
00:31:04,192 --> 00:31:09,568
No one who is upset because the suspect is black

574
00:31:09,824 --> 00:31:13,152
The people who organized Justice for Jasmine to Rally in Houston

575
00:31:13,408 --> 00:31:16,736
I'm just calling it off now that there isn't a race angle to it

576
00:31:17,248 --> 00:31:20,320
What's going on here and what Alex is putting forth in his defensive

577
00:31:20,576 --> 00:31:21,600
Mark is deeply trouble

578
00:31:22,368 --> 00:31:25,440
Cuz later in the video Mark starts throwing around some

579
00:31:25,696 --> 00:31:26,208
6 about shooting

580
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:30,816
Alex starts doing some more of that too in

581
00:31:31,328 --> 00:31:33,888
The statistics version of saying the n word

582
00:31:34,656 --> 00:31:36,448
I'm what

583
00:31:36,704 --> 00:31:38,496
No context that are solely meant to creative

584
00:31:38,752 --> 00:31:39,264
If your

585
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:41,056
We've got over the murder stats

586
00:31:41,312 --> 00:31:41,824
Manipulation

587
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,616
People like Alex can do to make them

588
00:31:43,872 --> 00:31:45,408
I shall do whatever he wants

589
00:31:45,664 --> 00:31:46,176
Fitness World

590
00:31:48,992 --> 00:31:51,040
Just a small example of it

591
00:31:51,552 --> 00:31:53,856
The 2017 the FBI's data shows that only six

592
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:55,392
51% of murders were even

593
00:31:58,720 --> 00:31:59,488
Of the people

594
00:31:59,744 --> 00:32:00,768
I haven't

595
00:32:01,792 --> 00:32:04,096
You kind of have to also ask yourself a question of

596
00:32:04,352 --> 00:32:05,120
Is it possible

597
00:32:05,376 --> 00:32:06,656
That partial Target

598
00:32:07,168 --> 00:32:07,936
Policing

599
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:09,472
Can Americans are black people

600
00:32:09,728 --> 00:32:12,544
Are responsible for them being over-represented in the arrest

601
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:14,848
When 39% of murders aren't even

602
00:32:16,128 --> 00:32:22,016
There's other issues possible vet

603
00:32:22,784 --> 00:32:24,832
So many black people

604
00:32:25,344 --> 00:32:30,464
Because they're only looking for black I'm not saying it is a piece of

605
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,512
The conversation

606
00:32:33,792 --> 00:32:34,560
And there's even

607
00:32:34,816 --> 00:32:40,960
More that we don't need to get a generalization as all of that

608
00:32:41,216 --> 00:32:45,312
Play the fact

609
00:32:46,592 --> 00:32:47,872
When you want to have a conversation about

610
00:32:48,896 --> 00:32:49,664
Those are important

611
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:51,456
As opposed to

612
00:32:51,712 --> 00:32:52,224
Just being like

613
00:32:52,736 --> 00:32:54,784
Blacks kill so many more people

614
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:01,952
Statistic I'd like to share with you that Alex and Mark Dice have no interest

615
00:33:03,232 --> 00:33:05,792
As of January 6th of this year there been 6 mass shooting

616
00:33:06,048 --> 00:33:06,560
United States

617
00:33:07,072 --> 00:33:07,840
7 people dead

618
00:33:09,376 --> 00:33:10,144
In less than a week

619
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:10,912
That does not

620
00:33:11,168 --> 00:33:11,680
Feel good

621
00:33:12,192 --> 00:33:14,240
Also according to FBI

622
00:33:14,496 --> 00:33:16,800
I think there's a more meaningful number to look at 3

623
00:33:17,056 --> 00:33:17,824
Comparison

624
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:19,872
Queen band

625
00:33:20,128 --> 00:33:20,640
And women

626
00:33:22,688 --> 00:33:27,296
Cuz there's a large gap between different races and ethnicities

627
00:33:27,552 --> 00:33:29,856
Justin Shearer bulk numbers

628
00:33:30,112 --> 00:33:32,416
It's fairly close it's not

629
00:33:32,672 --> 00:33:33,184
It's not

630
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:37,280
51% 49% or whatever it is

631
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:44,192
Have breakdowns at

632
00:33:45,472 --> 00:33:49,312
Closer than these other parameters

633
00:33:49,568 --> 00:33:53,920
A representative sample that can be used

634
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:54,944
Conclusion

635
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:59,552
2017 2932 women who were the victims of homicide

636
00:33:59,808 --> 00:34:00,576
Of them

637
00:34:00,832 --> 00:34:03,648
1733 were killed by men

638
00:34:03,904 --> 00:34:05,440
That's a 90% of rocks

639
00:34:06,464 --> 00:34:08,768
Conversely of the 4806

640
00:34:09,024 --> 00:34:10,816
The two men who were the victims of homicide

641
00:34:11,072 --> 00:34:13,376
Only 515 were killed by women

642
00:34:13,632 --> 00:34:14,656
Which is about 10%

643
00:34:15,168 --> 00:34:15,936
This is a statistic

644
00:34:16,192 --> 00:34:17,216
Sickly very important

645
00:34:17,728 --> 00:34:18,496
Information

646
00:34:19,008 --> 00:34:20,288
That's very relevant

647
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:21,312
Again

648
00:34:21,824 --> 00:34:22,592
This Loops back to

649
00:34:22,848 --> 00:34:24,640
To the 6 mass shootings already in 29

650
00:34:25,408 --> 00:34:27,200
Well most of them are still being investigated in

651
00:34:27,456 --> 00:34:31,296
Information hasn't been made public at least one of them is definitively domestic violence

652
00:34:31,552 --> 00:34:33,088
Situation where a man killed his wife

653
00:34:33,344 --> 00:34:35,136
A twelve-year-old child then himself

654
00:34:35,392 --> 00:34:37,440
Which is unfortunately a tragic pattern that we see

655
00:34:37,696 --> 00:34:38,976
Play out over and over again

656
00:34:39,488 --> 00:34:41,024
And that in turn Loops back to

657
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:41,792
Tulare Woodrow

658
00:34:42,304 --> 00:34:44,352
The man arrested for shooting Jasmine

659
00:34:44,608 --> 00:34:48,448
Floyd prior arrest for assaulting a family member and plead guilty in 27

660
00:34:48,704 --> 00:34:50,496
13th of trying to choke a woman

661
00:34:51,264 --> 00:34:52,544
The more pressing conversation

662
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:53,568
Have about murders in

663
00:34:54,336 --> 00:34:57,664
Arthur up about masculinity and access to guns

664
00:34:58,176 --> 00:34:59,456
The rest of it is irrelevant

665
00:34:59,712 --> 00:35:00,224
Shadow puppet

666
00:35:00,736 --> 00:35:03,552
People like Mark Dice now it's Jones used to justify there.

667
00:35:03,808 --> 00:35:04,576
Deep-seated racism

668
00:35:05,344 --> 00:35:06,624
Lambda buckshot

669
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:09,184
I'm so grateful

670
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,488
I was because we had that

671
00:35:11,744 --> 00:35:14,560
Conversation of the past were there pulling out some rates bulshit

672
00:35:14,816 --> 00:35:20,192
And so what wind up happening is we're like okay well if you want to play the race bulshit game

673
00:35:20,448 --> 00:35:22,240
Great here's all the bug that

674
00:35:22,752 --> 00:35:24,800
Goes against your butt butt

675
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:25,824
This isn't that

676
00:35:26,336 --> 00:35:27,872
No that's not what this is you

677
00:35:28,128 --> 00:35:30,432
Absolutely f****** nailed it and

678
00:35:30,688 --> 00:35:33,248
It has nothing to do with their b*******

679
00:35:33,504 --> 00:35:34,528
It's f****** dudes

680
00:35:37,088 --> 00:35:37,600
Yeah

681
00:35:37,856 --> 00:35:38,880
Subset of

682
00:35:40,416 --> 00:35:41,184
If you look at it just from us

683
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:43,232
Statistical point of view

684
00:35:43,488 --> 00:35:45,024
Do you have to wrestle with

685
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:45,792
The fact that

686
00:35:46,304 --> 00:35:48,352
Almost all murders of women

687
00:35:48,608 --> 00:35:49,376
Are done by men

688
00:35:49,888 --> 00:35:51,168
A very slim number of

689
00:35:51,424 --> 00:35:53,216
Murders of men are done by women

690
00:35:53,472 --> 00:35:56,032
So what we need to do is convince women to start

691
00:35:56,288 --> 00:35:59,616
Kelly Moore

692
00:35:59,872 --> 00:36:06,016
Girl

693
00:36:06,272 --> 00:36:11,648
I don't know it's stupid about this conversation

694
00:36:11,904 --> 00:36:12,416
Intentionally

695
00:36:13,696 --> 00:36:16,000
It's funny

696
00:36:16,256 --> 00:36:19,072
Point out that Mark.

697
00:36:19,328 --> 00:36:22,144
People only caring about this because they can demonize wifey

698
00:36:23,424 --> 00:36:24,448
Black people

699
00:36:24,704 --> 00:36:25,984
Then when you get behind a little bit

700
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:29,824
Every single piece of

701
00:36:30,848 --> 00:36:32,896
It's f****** stupid

702
00:36:33,408 --> 00:36:35,200
They're facing wild assertion

703
00:36:35,712 --> 00:36:36,992
And misrepresenting

704
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,296
And that's the game that Infowars played

705
00:36:39,808 --> 00:36:40,832
Because they are white

706
00:36:41,088 --> 00:36:44,160
Francis Outlet

707
00:36:44,672 --> 00:36:45,184
Of course

708
00:36:48,256 --> 00:36:50,048
May he rest in peace

709
00:36:50,816 --> 00:36:55,424
Also got an update tonight but better

710
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:59,520
I guess but he is a mess

711
00:37:00,032 --> 00:37:00,544
Suspension

712
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:01,312
From Alex

713
00:37:01,824 --> 00:37:04,640
He won't let him come back to work for a month because

714
00:37:04,896 --> 00:37:05,408
Just want to

715
00:37:05,664 --> 00:37:06,432
Being overstressed

716
00:37:08,992 --> 00:37:15,136
You know what we got to go.

717
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:19,488
But it is cool that is like at least

718
00:37:19,744 --> 00:37:22,560
Do we want to talk s*** on it but the idea of him

719
00:37:22,816 --> 00:37:23,840
Can't come back to work

720
00:37:24,352 --> 00:37:28,704
Keto salad

721
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:34,592
Your workers stand with labor even if that labor is f****** races

722
00:37:35,104 --> 00:37:36,640
Exactly

723
00:37:36,896 --> 00:37:37,920
So speaking of boring

724
00:37:40,736 --> 00:37:41,248
Not cool

725
00:37:45,344 --> 00:37:46,368
Naturalnews.com

726
00:37:46,624 --> 00:37:48,416
He is a real dick

727
00:37:49,696 --> 00:37:50,976
It seems to me

728
00:37:51,488 --> 00:37:52,512
If I had to guess

729
00:37:55,328 --> 00:37:59,424
Let's be really interested in Trump declaring a national emergency

730
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:00,192
Thanks

731
00:38:00,448 --> 00:38:02,752
I think a lot of it relies on articles that Mike

732
00:38:03,008 --> 00:38:03,776
Adams has written

733
00:38:04,032 --> 00:38:05,312
I think he's done the legwork

734
00:38:05,568 --> 00:38:06,336
Work on a lot of this

735
00:38:06,592 --> 00:38:08,128
And Alex is just thrilled that he doesn't have

736
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:09,152
Too much work

737
00:38:10,432 --> 00:38:11,712
Mike Adams

738
00:38:11,968 --> 00:38:13,248
Ideas to the Forefront

739
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,040
And I'm taking that mostly

740
00:38:16,832 --> 00:38:17,344
Where am I going

741
00:38:18,624 --> 00:38:19,136
Preferably.

742
00:38:20,672 --> 00:38:21,184
How is

743
00:38:21,696 --> 00:38:22,720
Not only

744
00:38:22,976 --> 00:38:24,000
In favor of an ashen

745
00:38:25,024 --> 00:38:25,536
Call

746
00:38:25,792 --> 00:38:28,352
He outright is calling for an authoritarian

747
00:38:29,632 --> 00:38:30,144
Okay

748
00:38:32,192 --> 00:38:32,960
I'm going to go

749
00:38:33,216 --> 00:38:35,264
I'm really going to take a hard

750
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:36,544
This is a hot tub

751
00:38:37,568 --> 00:38:38,848
I think that's a bad idea

752
00:38:39,616 --> 00:38:40,640
And we should not

753
00:38:41,408 --> 00:38:47,552
I'm with you on that I have reasons for it but I really don't feel like I should need to know

754
00:38:48,064 --> 00:38:54,208
For that

755
00:38:54,464 --> 00:38:56,768
Coming in here in just saying Trump is

756
00:38:57,024 --> 00:38:57,792
Is great there for

757
00:38:58,048 --> 00:39:01,632
He should be our dictator

758
00:39:01,888 --> 00:39:04,704
Good reason for it

759
00:39:05,216 --> 00:39:05,728
Doesn't

760
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:08,800
But he tried to make a jet

761
00:39:09,056 --> 00:39:10,592
Justification rationalization

762
00:39:12,128 --> 00:39:15,456
Use every Power of the executive

763
00:39:15,712 --> 00:39:18,272
In order to defeat the Deep state or we lose America

764
00:39:25,184 --> 00:39:30,304
Should declare martial law used the powers of the National Emergency to defend

765
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:36,192
America martial law and Rebellion

766
00:39:39,264 --> 00:39:42,336
So this is going to be sort of the way that they get around

767
00:39:42,592 --> 00:39:48,736
The complaints were making at the beginning yeah

768
00:39:48,992 --> 00:39:53,856
Idea we are already already in this state

769
00:39:54,368 --> 00:39:55,904
Declare this National Emergency

770
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:57,440
Start taking people's asses

771
00:39:57,696 --> 00:39:58,208
In order to

772
00:39:58,464 --> 00:40:00,512
All of the stuff that's been done already

773
00:40:00,768 --> 00:40:04,096
Right right right so if I understand correctly good lie

774
00:40:04,352 --> 00:40:05,888
Their argument is

775
00:40:06,144 --> 00:40:11,264
We've already been in martial law baby so he better declare martial law

776
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:17,152
Find out where martial law started for explain why they have

777
00:40:17,408 --> 00:40:23,552
Started

778
00:40:31,744 --> 00:40:37,376
And be like actually always been going on

779
00:40:37,888 --> 00:40:38,400
But here's the thing

780
00:40:38,656 --> 00:40:39,424
Mike try

781
00:40:39,936 --> 00:40:40,448
Mike Adams

782
00:40:40,704 --> 00:40:41,216
Try

783
00:40:41,472 --> 00:40:42,240
To pinpoint

784
00:40:42,496 --> 00:40:43,008
The beginning of

785
00:40:47,104 --> 00:40:47,872
It is not a good Ark

786
00:40:48,384 --> 00:40:48,896
Iraq

787
00:40:49,152 --> 00:40:50,688
Also the clip starts out

788
00:40:50,944 --> 00:40:51,456
Really f******

789
00:40:52,736 --> 00:40:54,016
Matanzas research

790
00:40:54,272 --> 00:40:56,576
Obama

791
00:41:03,232 --> 00:41:09,376
Tucker Carlson

792
00:41:09,632 --> 00:41:11,936
Emergency override

793
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:16,544
Crucially I was going to repeat it again it's March 16th

794
00:41:17,056 --> 00:41:23,200
I just posted a few minutes ago it's called The National Defense resources preparedness

795
00:41:23,456 --> 00:41:27,296
Order it's on whitehouse.gov

796
00:41:27,808 --> 00:41:29,856
In the opening paragraph

797
00:41:31,904 --> 00:41:37,536
Himself as the commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces of the United States of America

798
00:41:37,792 --> 00:41:38,560
Indicating

799
00:41:38,816 --> 00:41:40,096
That he had planned

800
00:41:40,352 --> 00:41:42,400
To use military force

801
00:41:42,656 --> 00:41:46,496
To seize control over all resources in the country

802
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:54,943
Was

803
00:42:00,063 --> 00:42:01,855
Absolutely

804
00:42:03,903 --> 00:42:06,463
Wrote down his literal title

805
00:42:09,791 --> 00:42:11,071
That's interesting I will get to that your

806
00:42:12,095 --> 00:42:13,887
First things first Mike Adams

807
00:42:14,399 --> 00:42:20,543
Search East most of the time doing things like lying about science naturalnews.com

808
00:42:20,799 --> 00:42:22,847
Tom Segura

809
00:42:23,103 --> 00:42:23,871
The Parkland shooting

810
00:42:24,127 --> 00:42:25,407
Mike Adams is a no nothing

811
00:42:25,663 --> 00:42:30,271
Piece of s*** of the highest order at can't say that strongly enough this guy is the worst

812
00:42:31,039 --> 00:42:34,879
Executive order it's number 13 603

813
00:42:35,135 --> 00:42:39,487
We can dispense with the idea that Obama released in order to declare martial law by declaring an emergency

814
00:42:39,743 --> 00:42:40,767
Dear whatever the f*** they're too

815
00:42:42,815 --> 00:42:45,887
All we need to do to understand what this executive order

816
00:42:46,143 --> 00:42:47,679
Is about to realize

817
00:42:47,935 --> 00:42:49,983
It was just an updating Bill Clinton

818
00:42:50,239 --> 00:42:51,263
Executive order one

819
00:42:51,519 --> 00:42:54,335
2919 four 1994

820
00:42:54,591 --> 00:42:56,895
And even that was really just a refinement of the defense

821
00:42:57,151 --> 00:42:57,663
Production Act

822
00:42:58,431 --> 00:43:00,223
50

823
00:43:00,479 --> 00:43:02,015
In order to help assure that the United

824
00:43:02,271 --> 00:43:04,575
States had access to necessary materials for defense

825
00:43:04,831 --> 00:43:08,159
Like aluminum as the Korean War start

826
00:43:10,207 --> 00:43:13,023
Extension of executive order 8248

827
00:43:13,279 --> 00:43:14,303
39 by f

828
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:18,399
Dior this is all just stuff that is fine too

829
00:43:18,911 --> 00:43:19,423
Refined

830
00:43:19,679 --> 00:43:21,983
Over the years we've been in martial law since

831
00:43:22,239 --> 00:43:23,007
The 30

832
00:43:23,263 --> 00:43:28,639
That's the wrong way to look at

833
00:43:28,895 --> 00:43:29,663
Exactly what you

834
00:43:29,919 --> 00:43:33,759
Is right there

835
00:43:34,015 --> 00:43:34,527
Production

836
00:43:34,783 --> 00:43:38,623
Jordan does his research

837
00:43:38,879 --> 00:43:45,023
Government are almost always either building upon something that a predecessor.

838
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:52,191
There's a few things out right introduction

839
00:43:52,447 --> 00:43:53,471
Wild new ideas

840
00:43:53,727 --> 00:43:58,079
This is all about executive order was necessary updated Bill Clinton

841
00:43:58,335 --> 00:44:01,151
Executive order and its really easy to understand

842
00:44:01,407 --> 00:44:03,455
The old executive order needed an update

843
00:44:04,223 --> 00:44:04,991
The Department of Homeland

844
00:44:05,247 --> 00:44:07,551
Security did not exist in 1994

845
00:44:07,807 --> 00:44:08,831
Existed

846
00:44:09,343 --> 00:44:09,855
Independent agent

847
00:44:10,367 --> 00:44:11,903
At the time I organization

848
00:44:12,159 --> 00:44:13,183
Some of the language

849
00:44:13,695 --> 00:44:14,463
You fixed in order to

850
00:44:14,719 --> 00:44:16,511
To reflect the changes in government bureaucracy

851
00:44:17,023 --> 00:44:19,839
That's almost all of the changes that were made by Obama

852
00:44:20,095 --> 00:44:20,607
Executive order

853
00:44:20,863 --> 00:44:21,375
It was just

854
00:44:21,631 --> 00:44:22,399
Clarifying this

855
00:44:22,655 --> 00:44:24,703
Different than they were

856
00:44:24,959 --> 00:44:26,239
What would it have been

857
00:44:27,263 --> 00:44:29,567
20

858
00:44:32,639 --> 00:44:35,711
18 years earlier

859
00:44:36,223 --> 00:44:38,271
So in response

860
00:44:38,527 --> 00:44:39,807
In response to that

861
00:44:40,831 --> 00:44:42,879
In response to the updating of line

862
00:44:43,391 --> 00:44:44,927
Include these organizations

863
00:44:45,183 --> 00:44:47,231
That were previously not included

864
00:44:51,583 --> 00:44:53,887
And said we will overthrow you

865
00:44:54,143 --> 00:44:56,191
Unless you do this

866
00:44:56,447 --> 00:44:56,959
And then

867
00:44:57,215 --> 00:44:57,727
Just

868
00:44:57,983 --> 00:44:59,263
Didn't and they didn't

869
00:44:59,775 --> 00:45:02,079
Hazelnut

870
00:45:02,335 --> 00:45:04,895
Scotch

871
00:45:07,199 --> 00:45:08,223
She's going to bring the military

872
00:45:09,503 --> 00:45:10,015
Nonsense

873
00:45:10,527 --> 00:45:11,807
First of all the order actually

874
00:45:12,575 --> 00:45:13,343
By saying quote

875
00:45:15,391 --> 00:45:16,927
President

876
00:45:17,183 --> 00:45:18,463
United States

877
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:20,511
American defense production Act

878
00:45:20,767 --> 00:45:21,535
1950

879
00:45:22,303 --> 00:45:23,583
And it's Mandarin

880
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:27,167
It's ordered as follows

881
00:45:27,679 --> 00:45:29,727
So my clearly read the paragraph

882
00:45:29,983 --> 00:45:31,519
Commander-in-chief

883
00:45:32,543 --> 00:45:33,311
Has parts

884
00:45:33,567 --> 00:45:36,895
How do you miss the part where explains that this is in relation to the defense production Act

885
00:45:37,407 --> 00:45:38,943
Really skinny

886
00:45:39,199 --> 00:45:40,479
That poorly or is he

887
00:45:42,783 --> 00:45:43,807
It's obvious

888
00:45:45,343 --> 00:45:46,879
Like it this isn't easy

889
00:45:47,135 --> 00:45:50,207
Nelly misleading people they understood oh well this is just really

890
00:45:51,743 --> 00:45:53,791
Let's go read the defense production Act of 90

891
00:45:54,047 --> 00:45:55,839
We can understand where all this

892
00:45:56,095 --> 00:45:59,423
From

893
00:45:59,679 --> 00:46:04,287
So in reality this executive order and its predecessor serve an important role in making sure

894
00:46:04,543 --> 00:46:05,311
The various departments

895
00:46:05,823 --> 00:46:07,359
Government

896
00:46:07,615 --> 00:46:08,639
Required an

897
00:46:09,151 --> 00:46:09,919
And Ari

898
00:46:10,175 --> 00:46:11,711
Powered by the ACT

899
00:46:12,223 --> 00:46:13,247
Executive orders

900
00:46:13,503 --> 00:46:14,527
Contracts

901
00:46:14,783 --> 00:46:16,831
Make sure that the country has access to those

902
00:46:17,087 --> 00:46:18,367
Materials that are needed

903
00:46:18,623 --> 00:46:22,207
Beyond that because of the some of the language in the bill that's about spending

904
00:46:22,719 --> 00:46:23,487
Consistent

905
00:46:23,999 --> 00:46:24,511
The 1980

906
00:46:25,791 --> 00:46:26,815
Emerging Technologies

907
00:46:27,071 --> 00:46:28,607
Technology and independent

908
00:46:28,863 --> 00:46:31,167
Research

909
00:46:31,935 --> 00:46:33,471
Oh and just because Alex and Michael

910
00:46:33,727 --> 00:46:34,495
Complete f****** idiot

911
00:46:35,007 --> 00:46:36,799
It should be pointed out that on June 13th

912
00:46:37,055 --> 00:46:38,335
2017 Trump

913
00:46:38,591 --> 00:46:39,871
Invoke the defense production Act

914
00:46:40,127 --> 00:46:41,919
In order to shift funding towards Franks

915
00:46:42,431 --> 00:46:43,967
Movie quote space industrial base

916
00:46:44,223 --> 00:46:46,271
A year before announcing

917
00:46:46,527 --> 00:46:50,879
Space horse because he declared martial law in the thirties and then Trump

918
00:46:51,391 --> 00:46:56,767
Finally seizing upon martial law

919
00:46:57,279 --> 00:47:02,655
I really don't understand what is the f*** that they're doing all the stuff they're talking about like Trump is already

920
00:47:03,935 --> 00:47:05,215
Foundational

921
00:47:06,495 --> 00:47:08,031
This executive order that really just

922
00:47:08,287 --> 00:47:08,799
Just a couple

923
00:47:09,311 --> 00:47:14,431
Yeah cuz the goddamn Homeland Security Department 94

924
00:47:14,687 --> 00:47:17,247
Even knows more about this news to f******

925
00:47:17,503 --> 00:47:18,527
Clowns

926
00:47:21,087 --> 00:47:27,231
Executive order that they're talking about as being evidence of Obama like setting all this up

927
00:47:27,487 --> 00:47:28,767
State of

928
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:34,143
Did the Claire his emergency in order to undo

929
00:47:34,399 --> 00:47:38,239
I don't know what good that would do but it sounds good too

930
00:47:38,751 --> 00:47:43,359
This National emergency order to stop

931
00:47:43,615 --> 00:47:46,943
Duration of National Emergency

932
00:47:47,199 --> 00:47:50,527
And if nobody

933
00:47:51,039 --> 00:47:52,575
Because there's everybody

934
00:47:54,111 --> 00:47:54,623
Uses

935
00:47:54,879 --> 00:47:57,951
Truly insane amount of power

936
00:47:58,463 --> 00:48:00,511
He often does so in order to

937
00:48:00,767 --> 00:48:01,791
Give the power back

938
00:48:02,303 --> 00:48:07,935
The people dance

939
00:48:08,959 --> 00:48:10,239
Key executive like

940
00:48:10,495 --> 00:48:16,639
With with so many kings I remember them like dissolving Parliament to remember when they dissolve parliament

941
00:48:19,199 --> 00:48:20,479
I can't think of a single inch

942
00:48:20,735 --> 00:48:22,015
Listen to someone sort of trying to

943
00:48:22,271 --> 00:48:22,783
Create

944
00:48:23,807 --> 00:48:26,623
Pure into that being what they're going to do and then going

945
00:48:26,879 --> 00:48:27,391
Bad

946
00:48:34,815 --> 00:48:38,143
Africa just defined popular

947
00:48:38,399 --> 00:48:41,983
It's a lot of bulshit but this is what Alex believes in what do you put in for

948
00:48:48,383 --> 00:48:50,687
Real good notice they don't have more to talk about

949
00:48:51,199 --> 00:48:51,967
They really do

950
00:48:52,479 --> 00:48:54,015
Anyway that they do

951
00:48:54,271 --> 00:48:58,367
But they were specific about executive order

952
00:48:59,391 --> 00:49:05,535
Obama 2012/2013 14

953
00:49:05,791 --> 00:49:07,327
15/16

954
00:49:09,631 --> 00:49:15,775
To emergency

955
00:49:18,847 --> 00:49:24,991
Those actions are still in place in operating at only under law

956
00:49:25,247 --> 00:49:27,807
National Emergency

957
00:49:28,063 --> 00:49:29,855
That's why you see the guy

958
00:49:30,111 --> 00:49:31,135
Belligerent

959
00:49:40,351 --> 00:49:43,935
Resources preparedness March 16th 2012

960
00:49:44,703 --> 00:49:48,799
Obama put under martial law in 2012

961
00:49:49,311 --> 00:49:51,871
That statement is written by Mike Adams

962
00:49:53,663 --> 00:49:59,039
Vic should carry any other weight then this is the guy I'm talking to you

963
00:49:59,295 --> 00:50:00,063
Actual state

964
00:50:00,831 --> 00:50:01,599
Tanqr

965
00:50:01,855 --> 00:50:02,623
Some sort of like

966
00:50:02,879 --> 00:50:05,183
Research Mike f****** Adams

967
00:50:05,439 --> 00:50:11,583
Hiiraan.com

968
00:50:11,839 --> 00:50:14,911
Said that he's a researcher which is why

969
00:50:15,167 --> 00:50:19,007
As a researcher

970
00:50:21,055 --> 00:50:22,079
It's a bummer

971
00:50:22,847 --> 00:50:23,359
Just a

972
00:50:23,615 --> 00:50:25,663
Because In that clip

973
00:50:25,919 --> 00:50:26,431
That we just played

974
00:50:26,943 --> 00:50:28,479
Alex Express

975
00:50:28,991 --> 00:50:29,759
Mentality

976
00:50:30,015 --> 00:50:30,783
Really don't like

977
00:50:31,807 --> 00:50:34,623
Comply in order to fight back against

978
00:50:35,135 --> 00:50:36,415
A dictatorship

979
00:50:36,671 --> 00:50:39,231
We must create a dictator

980
00:50:40,511 --> 00:50:41,535
The best he's got right

981
00:50:42,303 --> 00:50:43,071
Add that to me

982
00:50:43,583 --> 00:50:49,727
He's thin everybody knows that in order to

983
00:50:52,287 --> 00:50:58,431
Because that way you can defeat the imaginary one and we know which dictatorship is better the real one

984
00:50:58,687 --> 00:51:04,319
Remember how great dictatorships are is compared to real dictatorships are really awesome if they're doing

985
00:51:04,575 --> 00:51:05,343
Horrible things

986
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:08,415
Do you want a lot of people like that

987
00:51:08,927 --> 00:51:10,463
So there is that

988
00:51:10,719 --> 00:51:11,999
Is this next clip Mike explain

989
00:51:12,255 --> 00:51:14,047
Put under this martial law

990
00:51:15,071 --> 00:51:15,839
12:30

991
00:51:17,375 --> 00:51:17,887
Reason

992
00:51:18,143 --> 00:51:20,959
I didn't think that history was going to go the way it does

993
00:51:21,471 --> 00:51:23,007
And then pay close attention

994
00:51:23,519 --> 00:51:25,567
To what Mike is describing as what

995
00:51:25,823 --> 00:51:26,335
He wants to

996
00:51:27,359 --> 00:51:27,871
Because

997
00:51:28,127 --> 00:51:28,639
I can't

998
00:51:28,895 --> 00:51:29,407
Tell you how

999
00:51:29,663 --> 00:51:30,175
F***** up it is

1000
00:51:30,431 --> 00:51:30,943
Shakira

1001
00:51:31,199 --> 00:51:31,711
An adult

1002
00:51:33,503 --> 00:51:38,879
These powers that Obama in

1003
00:51:39,135 --> 00:51:43,743
To president Hillary Clinton this was the plan and Hillary Clinton

1004
00:51:46,815 --> 00:51:49,119
A people to arrest which includes you

1005
00:51:49,375 --> 00:51:50,655
Myself as well

1006
00:51:50,911 --> 00:51:57,055
You weren't on that list you'd never be on anyone's list Mike

1007
00:52:04,479 --> 00:52:05,503
A 90%

1008
00:52:05,759 --> 00:52:07,039
I would say higher than that

1009
00:52:08,575 --> 00:52:13,695
No f****** idea who Mike Adams 99.99 no flakes

1010
00:52:13,951 --> 00:52:16,255
Really need to stop exaggerating their oppression

1011
00:52:17,023 --> 00:52:23,167
We were all supposed to be arresting a shutdown when Trump won the presidency

1012
00:52:24,447 --> 00:52:29,311
These powers to President Trump

1013
00:52:29,567 --> 00:52:30,847
Has been reluctant

1014
00:52:31,103 --> 00:52:34,431
Hillary Clinton

1015
00:52:35,711 --> 00:52:38,271
The Deep State under Obama

1016
00:52:38,527 --> 00:52:42,111
The power to destroy the Deep state

1017
00:52:42,623 --> 00:52:44,159
This is why they are so terrifying

1018
00:52:44,415 --> 00:52:45,951
This is what it's all about

1019
00:52:46,207 --> 00:52:50,559
Trump only

1020
00:52:54,911 --> 00:52:56,959
Operating

1021
00:52:57,215 --> 00:53:03,359
Inside universities that have become terrorist recruitment centers the mayor's

1022
00:53:10,015 --> 00:53:10,527
Focuspower

1023
00:53:12,319 --> 00:53:14,879
And then restore true Liberty and National Security

1024
00:53:15,135 --> 00:53:16,159
To our country

1025
00:53:16,415 --> 00:53:17,439
What we are demanding

1026
00:53:18,463 --> 00:53:19,999
Now

1027
00:53:20,511 --> 00:53:23,583
That is a perfect description of

1028
00:53:23,839 --> 00:53:29,983
I mean it's so insane that

1029
00:53:30,239 --> 00:53:32,031
People would especially

1030
00:53:32,287 --> 00:53:34,591
Being like

1031
00:53:34,847 --> 00:53:38,431
The paranoid guys be like what we need is

1032
00:53:38,687 --> 00:53:39,967
A strong

1033
00:53:40,223 --> 00:53:42,527
Executive evoking emergency

1034
00:53:42,783 --> 00:53:48,671
Powers in order to root versity the military

1035
00:53:50,463 --> 00:53:52,511
This is she's describing authoritarian

1036
00:53:52,767 --> 00:53:54,815
Bribing

1037
00:53:55,071 --> 00:53:59,423
Creation of a fascist so that was a great idea though and Chairman Mao did it

1038
00:53:59,679 --> 00:54:05,823
Awesome idea

1039
00:54:10,687 --> 00:54:16,831
How many other times has this happened it's always worked out really well for everybody

1040
00:54:17,087 --> 00:54:17,599
Great job of doing

1041
00:54:22,207 --> 00:54:27,583
Would you like me to give

1042
00:54:27,839 --> 00:54:32,191
300 more f****** examples to Mike f****** the child India Adams

1043
00:54:32,447 --> 00:54:33,215
It's nuts

1044
00:54:33,471 --> 00:54:34,239
To hear something like that

1045
00:54:34,495 --> 00:54:37,567
Especially after all

1046
00:54:37,823 --> 00:54:38,847
Apocalyptic nonsense

1047
00:54:39,103 --> 00:54:41,407
Earlier

1048
00:54:42,431 --> 00:54:43,967
Like these things

1049
00:54:44,223 --> 00:54:45,247
Supposed

1050
00:54:45,759 --> 00:54:48,063
On the show are really f****** scary

1051
00:54:48,319 --> 00:54:49,343
Because it's not

1052
00:54:49,599 --> 00:54:50,111
Like

1053
00:54:51,647 --> 00:54:52,159
Stuff

1054
00:54:52,415 --> 00:54:53,695
You know like this is an adult

1055
00:54:53,951 --> 00:54:55,231
Who has a platform

1056
00:54:55,487 --> 00:54:58,047
Legitimately being like they're openly

1057
00:54:58,303 --> 00:54:58,815
Encouraging

1058
00:54:59,327 --> 00:55:00,351
Authoritarian

1059
00:55:00,863 --> 00:55:03,167
At this point

1060
00:55:06,495 --> 00:55:07,519
They're demanding

1061
00:55:08,031 --> 00:55:09,823
And that is not a good sign

1062
00:55:10,335 --> 00:55:11,359
Up to this point

1063
00:55:11,615 --> 00:55:14,431
All I've heard is it okay if

1064
00:55:14,943 --> 00:55:16,223
We get the go-ahead

1065
00:55:16,479 --> 00:55:20,575
To kill all of our political enemies

1066
00:55:22,111 --> 00:55:25,695
Tells us to

1067
00:55:27,487 --> 00:55:27,999
So that

1068
00:55:28,511 --> 00:55:29,535
That is the start

1069
00:55:30,047 --> 00:55:30,815
And then

1070
00:55:31,071 --> 00:55:31,583
To finish

1071
00:55:31,839 --> 00:55:32,351
Is

1072
00:55:32,863 --> 00:55:36,959
We're going to do this in order to set up an authoritarian fascist rule

1073
00:55:37,215 --> 00:55:40,799
All the Browns out

1074
00:55:41,055 --> 00:55:43,359
I really don't think that's how it works

1075
00:55:43,615 --> 00:55:44,639
It's not

1076
00:55:45,919 --> 00:55:47,455
Oh absolutely

1077
00:55:47,711 --> 00:55:52,063
Manufacturing but this idea of illegal immigrants

1078
00:55:52,319 --> 00:55:55,391
It's coming at like this is to all of this

1079
00:55:55,647 --> 00:55:56,415
That's what's making

1080
00:55:58,463 --> 00:55:59,743
Which is another really important

1081
00:56:00,511 --> 00:56:01,791
Before we get into that

1082
00:56:02,303 --> 00:56:02,815
We need to

1083
00:56:03,071 --> 00:56:04,095
Really take a look

1084
00:56:04,351 --> 00:56:05,375
MC Abyss

1085
00:56:05,631 --> 00:56:07,935
And see how bad these ideas Mike Adams

1086
00:56:08,191 --> 00:56:08,959
Is espousing

1087
00:56:09,215 --> 00:56:10,495
On the show e.r.

1088
00:56:10,751 --> 00:56:12,287
Isn't he says something that's

1089
00:56:14,847 --> 00:56:20,991
It's the appropriate the military it's a constitutional for the military to defend the borders and also

1090
00:56:22,015 --> 00:56:23,551
Posse Comitatus

1091
00:56:24,063 --> 00:56:28,159
It prevents the military from acting as police on the streets of America

1092
00:56:28,415 --> 00:56:30,719
But it does not prevent military police

1093
00:56:30,975 --> 00:56:31,999
From pursuing

1094
00:56:32,255 --> 00:56:36,607
Enemies of America who are on American soil

1095
00:56:36,863 --> 00:56:38,911
Appointment

1096
00:56:39,423 --> 00:56:41,727
To arrest and seek out treasonous

1097
00:56:41,983 --> 00:56:48,127
Traders us soil there is no restriction against that

1098
00:56:48,383 --> 00:56:51,455
Because

1099
00:56:53,503 --> 00:56:55,807
Military police operating on us soil and domestic

1100
00:56:56,063 --> 00:56:56,575
Law enforcement

1101
00:56:56,831 --> 00:56:57,855
A hundred percent

1102
00:56:58,111 --> 00:56:58,879
Play against the Posse

1103
00:56:59,135 --> 00:57:00,415
Comitatus Act

1104
00:57:04,767 --> 00:57:08,351
What Mike is advocating for is literally how dictator Shore up our

1105
00:57:08,607 --> 00:57:09,375
We've seen it a hundred times

1106
00:57:10,143 --> 00:57:12,703
Simple example you brought up earlier after his stage

1107
00:57:12,959 --> 00:57:16,031
In January 2016 Turkish president

1108
00:57:16,287 --> 00:57:19,103
Called in the military police of his perceived enemies

1109
00:57:19,615 --> 00:57:22,175
Within nine months 110,000 people have been to

1110
00:57:22,943 --> 00:57:28,319
Approximately 50000 of them were arrested

1111
00:57:28,831 --> 00:57:33,439
Manufactured cool that even created that was a real coup and of course it just so happened that hundred thousand

1112
00:57:33,695 --> 00:57:35,231
The people who were his political enemies

1113
00:57:35,999 --> 00:57:40,607
I've got a hundred ten thousand people 7463 of them are members of the military

1114
00:57:40,863 --> 00:57:41,887
Terry / 10,000

1115
00:57:42,143 --> 00:57:42,655
Police officer

1116
00:57:43,167 --> 00:57:45,727
2575 or prosecutors

1117
00:57:45,983 --> 00:57:47,775
Judges disagreed with

1118
00:57:48,031 --> 00:57:49,567
Some even reportedly members of the

1119
00:57:50,847 --> 00:57:51,871
2700

1120
00:57:52,383 --> 00:57:52,895
Journalist

1121
00:57:53,407 --> 00:57:55,967
179 media Outlets were shut down

1122
00:57:56,223 --> 00:57:56,991
Between the stage

1123
00:57:57,247 --> 00:57:58,015
To in the end of

1124
00:57:58,271 --> 00:57:58,783
2016

1125
00:57:59,295 --> 00:58:00,319
The reason is important

1126
00:58:00,575 --> 00:58:01,855
Is that these people who were the

1127
00:58:02,111 --> 00:58:03,647
Target Savard wants Crackdown

1128
00:58:03,903 --> 00:58:07,487
Are precisely the people Alex and Michael saying Trump needs to go out

1129
00:58:08,255 --> 00:58:10,815
The entrenched globalist in the military and police forces

1130
00:58:11,071 --> 00:58:17,215
The globalist judges on the 9th circuit won't let you have a flag all the mainstream

1131
00:58:17,471 --> 00:58:17,983
American people

1132
00:58:18,495 --> 00:58:21,055
In a very real sense I mean this with no exaggeration

1133
00:58:22,847 --> 00:58:24,127
Alex Jones

1134
00:58:24,383 --> 00:58:29,503
Have now embraced calling for an outright authoritarian coup under the stewardship of their hero Donald's

1135
00:58:30,015 --> 00:58:32,575
This is a very different and much more

1136
00:58:32,831 --> 00:58:35,135
The beer situation then we saw a few weeks ago

1137
00:58:35,391 --> 00:58:36,671
And the massive escalation of the

1138
00:58:37,695 --> 00:58:38,207
We feel great

1139
00:58:38,463 --> 00:58:38,975
About what

1140
00:58:39,487 --> 00:58:39,999
Now

1141
00:58:40,255 --> 00:58:42,815
That being said I don't think that's necessarily

1142
00:58:43,327 --> 00:58:45,119
Translate to the real world

1143
00:58:45,375 --> 00:58:47,935
I think there's a very small section of Alex Jones

1144
00:58:48,191 --> 00:58:49,727
Audience that will be

1145
00:58:50,495 --> 00:58:52,543
U-Like severely negatively affected by

1146
00:58:52,799 --> 00:58:54,335
Right I'm just because Alex

1147
00:58:54,591 --> 00:58:55,103
Advocating

1148
00:58:55,359 --> 00:58:56,639
Mike Adams.

1149
00:58:57,663 --> 00:59:00,991
It doesn't mean the Trump is going to do that I don't want anyone to get that idea

1150
00:59:01,247 --> 00:59:03,039
But because we were show that

1151
00:59:03,295 --> 00:59:03,807
It follows out

1152
00:59:05,087 --> 00:59:06,623
You know we tracked this sort of

1153
00:59:08,415 --> 00:59:12,255
We know that this is been something that he's into for a bit

1154
00:59:12,511 --> 00:59:15,327
Yeah but the way their overtly talkin about it

1155
00:59:15,839 --> 00:59:16,863
He's a very marked

1156
00:59:17,119 --> 00:59:17,631
Change

1157
00:59:18,143 --> 00:59:19,423
It is very scary to

1158
00:59:19,935 --> 00:59:21,727
The idea that they feel comfortable

1159
00:59:22,495 --> 00:59:23,007
Because

1160
00:59:23,263 --> 00:59:23,775
They believe

1161
00:59:24,799 --> 00:59:26,335
Trump is going to declare this match

1162
00:59:26,591 --> 00:59:27,615
National Emergency

1163
00:59:27,871 --> 00:59:29,407
They can wear it openly

1164
00:59:29,663 --> 00:59:30,687
That they can say

1165
00:59:30,943 --> 00:59:31,967
It is a good idea

1166
00:59:32,223 --> 00:59:34,271
The military police Roundup potential

1167
00:59:34,527 --> 00:59:36,575
Political enemies

1168
00:59:36,831 --> 00:59:38,623
That is really f****** scary

1169
00:59:38,879 --> 00:59:39,903
Because that means

1170
00:59:40,159 --> 00:59:41,695
Did you shoot ever goes that way

1171
00:59:41,951 --> 00:59:42,719
They're going to be the

1172
00:59:42,975 --> 00:59:43,743
First people

1173
00:59:43,999 --> 00:59:44,767
Cheerleading

1174
00:59:45,791 --> 00:59:47,327
Of course

1175
00:59:47,583 --> 00:59:49,631
They're going to be the people who are on

1176
00:59:49,887 --> 00:59:54,495
On the radio in Rwanda

1177
01:00:01,663 --> 01:00:02,431
Right now

1178
01:00:02,687 --> 01:00:08,831
Oh my God now that we know Trump's going to do it I'm so glad it's finally okay for us to say that we need to

1179
01:00:09,087 --> 01:00:13,439
Have a racial cleansing and that includes

1180
01:00:13,695 --> 01:00:19,839
Hey if you're a white person but you support those races that we don't like guess what your race-traitor you're one of them

1181
01:00:21,887 --> 01:00:27,519
I mean it is it is a like gentleman speak kind of mom

1182
01:00:27,775 --> 01:00:28,543
The map drops

1183
01:00:31,615 --> 01:00:32,127
If you been meaning

1184
01:00:32,383 --> 01:00:33,151
For a long time

1185
01:00:34,431 --> 01:00:35,711
It it's just

1186
01:00:36,735 --> 01:00:39,551
I can't I can't legitimately can't imagine

1187
01:00:39,807 --> 01:00:41,087
A scenario wherein

1188
01:00:43,391 --> 01:00:46,207
Even if someone had like less politics that I agreed with

1189
01:00:46,463 --> 01:00:47,487
Advocating

1190
01:00:47,999 --> 01:00:48,511
Military police

1191
01:00:49,279 --> 01:00:49,791
Conservative

1192
01:00:50,047 --> 01:00:50,815
Even the alt-right

1193
01:00:51,071 --> 01:00:53,375
Even Nazis

1194
01:00:55,679 --> 01:00:59,775
But you know I'm saying like even if I heard that there's no way that I would be like

1195
01:01:00,799 --> 01:01:01,311
Triumphantly

1196
01:01:05,407 --> 01:01:06,175
Ikea

1197
01:01:06,687 --> 01:01:10,015
Imagine getting place and what you realize when you see Mama

1198
01:01:11,039 --> 01:01:11,551
They don't need to

1199
01:01:11,807 --> 01:01:12,319
Get to that

1200
01:01:13,343 --> 01:01:14,367
That's their place

1201
01:01:14,623 --> 01:01:15,135
Yep

1202
01:01:15,903 --> 01:01:17,951
There are there are so many times with

1203
01:01:18,463 --> 01:01:23,071
So many of the rules in the Norms that existed within Congress prior to

1204
01:01:23,327 --> 01:01:23,839
Baby

1205
01:01:24,351 --> 01:01:25,119
Mitch McConnell

1206
01:01:25,375 --> 01:01:26,143
Dumb f*** face

1207
01:01:27,167 --> 01:01:29,727
Time machine

1208
01:01:32,031 --> 01:01:36,639
So many of these rules are in place because everybody kind of implicitly got

1209
01:01:36,895 --> 01:01:38,687
That if we change these rules

1210
01:01:39,199 --> 01:01:39,967
For us

1211
01:01:40,479 --> 01:01:42,271
There will be a pendulum swing back

1212
01:01:42,527 --> 01:01:46,111
And those rule changes that we

1213
01:01:46,623 --> 01:01:47,391
Can then be used

1214
01:01:47,903 --> 01:01:48,671
42r d'etre

1215
01:01:49,183 --> 01:01:55,071
The pick your spots first democracy and Republic

1216
01:01:55,839 --> 01:01:58,399
And with these guys there is something that is

1217
01:02:00,191 --> 01:02:01,471
That is now explicit

1218
01:02:01,727 --> 01:02:02,495
Which is that

1219
01:02:03,007 --> 01:02:05,567
When you talk about one side or the other

1220
01:02:06,591 --> 01:02:08,127
Only one side is

1221
01:02:08,383 --> 01:02:10,687
Literally using these rule changes

1222
01:02:10,943 --> 01:02:11,711
In bad faith

1223
01:02:12,223 --> 01:02:12,735
To harm

1224
01:02:13,759 --> 01:02:14,271
It does seem

1225
01:02:14,783 --> 01:02:18,879
It ends so so they kind of don't care about the pendulum swing

1226
01:02:19,135 --> 01:02:22,975
Because why would they know that if the pendulum swings backwards

1227
01:02:23,743 --> 01:02:29,887
They're not going to do to us what we want to do to them well and they also kind of understand you do you swing a

1228
01:02:30,143 --> 01:02:31,167
Pendulum hard enough

1229
01:02:31,423 --> 01:02:36,287
It just gets lodged it broken or whatever you know

1230
01:02:36,543 --> 01:02:42,175
Even if you use a pendulum metaphor

1231
01:02:42,431 --> 01:02:43,199
One Direction

1232
01:02:44,479 --> 01:02:47,295
You end up with broken political system that doesn't

1233
01:02:47,551 --> 01:02:50,623
Fix itself it doesn't swing back the other way

1234
01:02:50,879 --> 01:02:54,719
The exact same thing about and screaming

1235
01:02:54,975 --> 01:02:57,535
Talking about 4 years right

1236
01:03:00,351 --> 01:03:03,167
Is essentially the same thing that is the dichotomy

1237
01:03:03,679 --> 01:03:04,447
John Waterman

1238
01:03:04,703 --> 01:03:05,727
Wednesday

1239
01:03:07,263 --> 01:03:08,031
Kerry Cassidy

1240
01:03:08,287 --> 01:03:10,079
Please show and on his own blog

1241
01:03:10,847 --> 01:03:12,383
On Kerry Cassidy show

1242
01:03:12,639 --> 01:03:13,663
That's Alex

1243
01:03:14,175 --> 01:03:14,943
A year ago

1244
01:03:15,967 --> 01:03:17,247
Not bringing up that he hates

1245
01:03:17,503 --> 01:03:18,015
The Jews

1246
01:03:18,271 --> 01:03:24,159
Just being like certain groups certain groups

1247
01:03:24,415 --> 01:03:25,183
He talks about how it's

1248
01:03:27,487 --> 01:03:28,511
Exterminate

1249
01:03:28,767 --> 01:03:30,559
Blah blah blah

1250
01:03:30,815 --> 01:03:32,351
I'm not saying

1251
01:03:34,143 --> 01:03:35,935
Metaphor

1252
01:03:36,191 --> 01:03:39,263
A year ago there was the couch nastua there was this

1253
01:03:39,519 --> 01:03:40,799
There was more of a

1254
01:03:42,079 --> 01:03:43,103
It wasn't this over

1255
01:03:45,407 --> 01:03:45,919
Right now

1256
01:03:46,431 --> 01:03:47,455
Is directly calling

1257
01:03:47,711 --> 01:03:48,223
4

1258
01:03:48,735 --> 01:03:49,503
What brings

1259
01:03:52,063 --> 01:03:52,575
He doesn't give a

1260
01:03:53,855 --> 01:03:54,367
Never gave us

1261
01:03:54,623 --> 01:03:55,391
It's it's

1262
01:03:55,647 --> 01:03:57,439
I mean

1263
01:03:57,695 --> 01:04:00,511
Yeah caring about the consequences

1264
01:04:01,535 --> 01:04:02,047
It has fallen

1265
01:04:02,559 --> 01:04:03,583
He does not care about any of

1266
01:04:05,119 --> 01:04:06,911
We could talk about how like

1267
01:04:07,935 --> 01:04:12,287
You know earlier in the year we had like him saying that rex-84 is

1268
01:04:12,543 --> 01:04:18,687
Posse Comitatus doesn't matter send the military to the border of this.

1269
01:04:18,943 --> 01:04:20,223
We can talk about all that stuff

1270
01:04:21,759 --> 01:04:24,575
Most people look at that and they wanted clown on Alex

1271
01:04:24,831 --> 01:04:25,343
For being a

1272
01:04:25,855 --> 01:04:26,367
Right

1273
01:04:26,879 --> 01:04:27,391
And I'm not interested

1274
01:04:27,903 --> 01:04:29,439
Not necessarily I don't think we have been

1275
01:04:30,719 --> 01:04:31,231
Metal though

1276
01:04:31,487 --> 01:04:32,255
May be pointed out

1277
01:04:32,511 --> 01:04:33,791
From time to time

1278
01:04:34,559 --> 01:04:35,071
I think

1279
01:04:35,327 --> 01:04:35,839
The people mist

1280
01:04:36,095 --> 01:04:36,607
The point

1281
01:04:37,375 --> 01:04:37,887
What it is

1282
01:04:38,399 --> 01:04:39,679
Is those were always

1283
01:04:39,935 --> 01:04:40,959
Performative aspect

1284
01:04:41,215 --> 01:04:41,727
Of what he

1285
01:04:41,983 --> 01:04:42,495
Was doing

1286
01:04:42,751 --> 01:04:43,775
What he was doing

1287
01:04:44,799 --> 01:04:45,823
And is still doing

1288
01:04:47,103 --> 01:04:47,871
Is defending White

1289
01:04:48,895 --> 01:04:49,407
Defending

1290
01:04:49,663 --> 01:04:50,943
The status quo

1291
01:04:51,199 --> 01:04:51,967
Of a

1292
01:04:52,479 --> 01:04:54,015
White Centric

1293
01:04:54,271 --> 01:04:55,039
Chauvinist

1294
01:04:55,295 --> 01:04:57,087
This normative world

1295
01:04:57,343 --> 01:04:59,135
Yeah those are the insta

1296
01:05:00,671 --> 01:05:01,439
Fat weird liquor

1297
01:05:04,255 --> 01:05:09,375
Vaguely religious so long as it justifies whatever works out.

1298
01:05:09,631 --> 01:05:12,703
What he's always done with all of these narratives

1299
01:05:12,959 --> 01:05:13,983
Is prop up an

1300
01:05:14,751 --> 01:05:15,519
Apologize for

1301
01:05:16,031 --> 01:05:16,543
Terrorism

1302
01:05:18,335 --> 01:05:19,615
And now he's abandoned

1303
01:05:20,127 --> 01:05:20,639
The mask

1304
01:05:20,895 --> 01:05:23,199
Of caring about tyranny because

1305
01:05:23,455 --> 01:05:29,599
The guy who's going to bring in the Tyranny that he want is in favor of all of those things he's a f****** chauvinist

1306
01:05:29,855 --> 01:05:30,367
The racist

1307
01:05:30,623 --> 01:05:31,135
He doesn't like

1308
01:05:31,647 --> 01:05:33,695
And he's a rapist

1309
01:05:35,231 --> 01:05:36,511
Skateboarding doesn't want to move right

1310
01:05:37,023 --> 01:05:41,631
Does alarm in the military or whatever sprocket is surround himself.

1311
01:05:41,887 --> 01:05:42,911
Who cares about

1312
01:05:43,167 --> 01:05:45,983
Litigating it personal

1313
01:05:46,239 --> 01:05:47,007
That would be had

1314
01:05:48,031 --> 01:05:48,543
So

1315
01:05:48,799 --> 01:05:49,567
He knows that

1316
01:05:50,079 --> 01:05:50,591
Dinos

1317
01:05:51,359 --> 01:05:53,919
It's a small Revelation that we've already made with

1318
01:05:54,687 --> 01:05:55,199
If it is

1319
01:05:56,223 --> 01:05:57,503
He is comfortable now

1320
01:05:57,759 --> 01:05:58,527
Because his guys don't

1321
01:05:58,783 --> 01:05:59,295
To protect

1322
01:05:59,551 --> 01:06:00,319
If he wants protect it

1323
01:06:00,831 --> 01:06:02,623
But it's just crazy to see that it is

1324
01:06:03,135 --> 01:06:04,159
Not just about

1325
01:06:04,415 --> 01:06:05,183
These little things

1326
01:06:05,695 --> 01:06:08,511
It's about everything Noah career is based on a lie

1327
01:06:08,767 --> 01:06:14,911
We talked about it on a previous episode where we were discussing that kind of hypocrisy angle

1328
01:06:15,167 --> 01:06:18,495
And it really isn't hypocrisy.

1329
01:06:18,751 --> 01:06:19,263
Is

1330
01:06:19,519 --> 01:06:22,847
I'm afraid they're going to do what

1331
01:06:23,359 --> 01:06:27,711
I'm afraid they're going to do that to us

1332
01:06:27,967 --> 01:06:29,503
That's what I'm afraid of tyranny

1333
01:06:29,759 --> 01:06:33,343
Not because tyranny is bad because we're going to get

1334
01:06:33,599 --> 01:06:34,623
Literal comeuppance

1335
01:06:34,879 --> 01:06:35,647
The right kind of

1336
01:06:36,671 --> 01:06:39,999
Is grapes good in the wrong kind

1337
01:06:40,255 --> 01:06:41,023
Exactly

1338
01:06:41,535 --> 01:06:44,095
It's that it's late right

1339
01:06:44,351 --> 01:06:48,191
I think it's worth it just little. You're having that

1340
01:06:48,447 --> 01:06:48,959
Discussion

1341
01:06:49,215 --> 01:06:52,031
Because I think it's a people who aren't

1342
01:06:54,335 --> 01:06:55,103
Understand it

1343
01:06:55,359 --> 01:06:55,871
What

1344
01:06:56,127 --> 01:06:56,639
Does

1345
01:06:56,895 --> 01:06:57,919
Misunderstand

1346
01:06:58,431 --> 01:06:59,711
Anime

1347
01:07:02,271 --> 01:07:05,855
Oh look at this you're a hypocrite cuz now you believe this when you said that

1348
01:07:06,111 --> 01:07:07,647
It's a much more Salient attacking

1349
01:07:07,903 --> 01:07:08,415
Getting much worse

1350
01:07:10,207 --> 01:07:10,975
To say

1351
01:07:11,743 --> 01:07:13,535
Oh what this does is it reveals that

1352
01:07:13,791 --> 01:07:16,351
You never cared about that but would you care about

1353
01:07:16,607 --> 01:07:18,911
And what was motivating your rhetoric

1354
01:07:19,167 --> 01:07:21,727
That's motivating it now I think it's a holistic

1355
01:07:21,983 --> 01:07:22,751
More

1356
01:07:23,007 --> 01:07:23,775
Reasonable

1357
01:07:24,287 --> 01:07:25,567
Way to look at things

1358
01:07:27,359 --> 01:07:31,199
I don't know I don't know if it helps anything but it's reality

1359
01:07:31,455 --> 01:07:37,599
And it's so important that over and over and over again to make this point is that Alex has the weakest link

1360
01:07:37,855 --> 01:07:39,391
Lincoln this right-wing propaganda chain

1361
01:07:39,647 --> 01:07:44,511
So many people in this right-wing propaganda

1362
01:07:45,535 --> 01:07:48,095
Pretty much support

1363
01:07:48,607 --> 01:07:51,935
Caldwell Parish fair enough

1364
01:07:52,191 --> 01:07:58,335
But but

1365
01:07:58,591 --> 01:08:01,663
In the right-wing propaganda so many people on Fox News

1366
01:08:01,919 --> 01:08:03,711
Smoked would say

1367
01:08:04,223 --> 01:08:05,759
Not in the same words

1368
01:08:06,015 --> 01:08:09,599
But in a far like in a far better couch language

1369
01:08:09,855 --> 01:08:10,879
Essentially the same thing

1370
01:08:11,135 --> 01:08:14,975
Let Mike Adams come on and say the military

1371
01:08:15,231 --> 01:08:17,279
Police as a constitutional role.

1372
01:08:18,559 --> 01:08:19,327
Potential enemies

1373
01:08:19,583 --> 01:08:20,607
Stuff like that

1374
01:08:20,863 --> 01:08:23,679
It is directly antithetical to

1375
01:08:23,935 --> 01:08:25,471
So many of the very ideas

1376
01:08:25,727 --> 01:08:29,055
The freedom and it's the sort of thing that has always LED down

1377
01:08:29,311 --> 01:08:29,823
Pastore

1378
01:08:30,591 --> 01:08:31,359
Centralized

1379
01:08:31,615 --> 01:08:32,639
Control oppression

1380
01:08:33,407 --> 01:08:34,943
And all that s***

1381
01:08:35,199 --> 01:08:39,807
Tucker Carlson wouldn't have Mike Adams on to stay back.

1382
01:08:40,319 --> 01:08:40,831
But

1383
01:08:42,111 --> 01:08:43,135
Trump did do that

1384
01:08:43,903 --> 01:08:45,695
Tucker Carlson would defend it

1385
01:08:45,951 --> 01:08:50,559
Probably not allowed to

1386
01:08:50,815 --> 01:08:54,911
But so far allowed to do that

1387
01:08:55,167 --> 01:08:55,679
Be as weak

1388
01:08:55,935 --> 01:09:00,799
As this Obama's executive order put us under martial law Trump is just

1389
01:09:01,055 --> 01:09:04,383
Yeah that's

1390
01:09:04,895 --> 01:09:05,919
Petexec

1391
01:09:09,759 --> 01:09:11,039
Like all that stuff is so easy

1392
01:09:11,551 --> 01:09:12,063
The track down

1393
01:09:12,319 --> 01:09:15,135
It's not even Alex's normal stuff or it's like

1394
01:09:15,391 --> 01:09:16,927
If you got to go

1395
01:09:17,183 --> 01:09:18,719
Eco science

1396
01:09:18,975 --> 01:09:20,511
Yeah yeah

1397
01:09:22,303 --> 01:09:24,095
Gone down a little bit of a road

1398
01:09:24,351 --> 01:09:26,143
I'm not mad about that

1399
01:09:26,399 --> 01:09:26,911
To remember

1400
01:09:27,167 --> 01:09:27,935
Is it Alex's certain

1401
01:09:28,191 --> 01:09:28,703
Uno's

1402
01:09:29,727 --> 01:09:30,239
Tonight

1403
01:09:42,271 --> 01:09:44,063
Emergency

1404
01:09:45,087 --> 01:09:46,111
East County Clare

1405
01:09:51,743 --> 01:09:53,791
We know he's going to do what he's going to do

1406
01:09:54,047 --> 01:09:54,559
Throughout the app

1407
01:09:55,327 --> 01:09:56,607
So earlier

1408
01:09:56,863 --> 01:09:59,167
We're sort of bucking at Mike Adams talk

1409
01:09:59,423 --> 01:10:00,959
I'm about like who is the America

1410
01:10:01,215 --> 01:10:02,239
You're talking about

1411
01:10:02,751 --> 01:10:03,519
Exquisite

1412
01:10:04,543 --> 01:10:05,567
You know he's just kind of makes

1413
01:10:07,359 --> 01:10:10,431
We reach real America and real America supports Trump

1414
01:10:10,687 --> 01:10:14,015
Supports a declaration of a National Emergency if that's what it takes

1415
01:10:36,031 --> 01:10:38,591
We are in a war to the claret

1416
01:10:38,847 --> 01:10:44,991
Disassemble a tablet

1417
01:10:45,247 --> 01:10:47,551
America and this war on America has been

1418
01:10:47,807 --> 01:10:53,951
Going on since 2008 model h

1419
01:10:54,207 --> 01:10:54,975
.

1420
01:11:00,351 --> 01:11:06,495
Nothing that makes me feel better about Alex at the time for vengeance isn't out

1421
01:11:06,751 --> 01:11:07,263
Because in this clip

1422
01:11:07,519 --> 01:11:12,127
A mere hour after that he sang the globalist of drawn First Blood they're fair game

1423
01:11:12,383 --> 01:11:13,407
Which I think

1424
01:11:13,663 --> 01:11:16,735
You could interpret as in being like

1425
01:11:17,503 --> 01:11:18,271
Kind of feels that way it

1426
01:11:18,527 --> 01:11:23,647
It's really f***** up and then Mike Adams

1427
01:11:23,903 --> 01:11:24,415
2000

1428
01:11:24,671 --> 01:11:28,511
Why is that a 2012 dumbfucks

1429
01:11:28,767 --> 01:11:31,071
Is it just because of Obama

1430
01:11:31,839 --> 01:11:32,863
I don't know if you noticed

1431
01:11:33,119 --> 01:11:39,263
Did you notice that could be part of it

1432
01:11:39,519 --> 01:11:44,895
Oh we're in a war now

1433
01:11:45,407 --> 01:11:51,551
You're I don't know I don't know what you wanted I don't know what you want to call it if not

1434
01:11:51,807 --> 01:11:54,623
Let's call it Christian Bale

1435
01:11:54,879 --> 01:11:55,903
Colonial

1436
01:11:56,159 --> 01:11:56,927
White identity

1437
01:11:57,439 --> 01:11:59,487
We have been fighting a war

1438
01:11:59,743 --> 01:12:01,023
In this country

1439
01:12:01,279 --> 01:12:02,047
Since it started

1440
01:12:02,303 --> 01:12:06,399
Applebee's

1441
01:12:06,655 --> 01:12:07,423
It's been against

1442
01:12:07,679 --> 01:12:08,703
Women is Finnegan

1443
01:12:08,959 --> 01:12:13,055
People of color it's been against every possible minority that isn't White

1444
01:12:13,311 --> 01:12:14,847
It's been a good f****** Catholic

1445
01:12:16,127 --> 01:12:16,895
You guys

1446
01:12:19,455 --> 01:12:23,551
And the only fightback that anybody has ever had is been like

1447
01:12:24,831 --> 01:12:28,927
Guess what we're making your life better to you dumb f***

1448
01:12:29,183 --> 01:12:33,535
There's been a shifting of alliances people who have not been on

1449
01:12:34,047 --> 01:12:40,191
It's not like a consistent one group throughout the entire time

1450
01:12:42,239 --> 01:12:43,007
DxD

1451
01:12:44,031 --> 01:12:44,799
Like

1452
01:12:45,055 --> 01:12:46,847
More or less history of

1453
01:12:47,103 --> 01:12:48,127
Exclusion in ink

1454
01:12:49,663 --> 01:12:51,199
Struggle throughout the

1455
01:12:51,455 --> 01:12:52,223
The entire time

1456
01:12:52,991 --> 01:12:54,783
You can kind of boil stuff

1457
01:12:55,551 --> 01:12:56,063
Minimizing

1458
01:12:56,575 --> 01:12:57,599
Real serious

1459
01:12:57,855 --> 01:12:58,879
Like chattel slavery

1460
01:12:59,135 --> 01:13:02,975
That was driven by exclusion

1461
01:13:06,559 --> 01:13:07,071
Include

1462
01:13:07,327 --> 01:13:08,351
Catholics in the Irish

1463
01:13:08,607 --> 01:13:10,399
Stop lights

1464
01:13:10,911 --> 01:13:11,423
Exclude

1465
01:13:11,679 --> 01:13:13,727
From the group that's allowed to have access to

1466
01:13:13,983 --> 01:13:14,751
To power exact

1467
01:13:15,007 --> 01:13:16,799
Power access

1468
01:13:17,055 --> 01:13:18,079
Influence money

1469
01:13:18,335 --> 01:13:18,847
Capital

1470
01:13:19,103 --> 01:13:20,127
All that sort of stuff

1471
01:13:20,639 --> 01:13:23,199
Insta edit even talked about like worker

1472
01:13:24,735 --> 01:13:26,271
Explosion

1473
01:13:26,527 --> 01:13:27,295
Has always been

1474
01:13:27,551 --> 01:13:28,063
Sort of.

1475
01:13:28,319 --> 01:13:28,831
Define line

1476
01:13:29,343 --> 01:13:30,111
Of what

1477
01:13:30,367 --> 01:13:30,879
This

1478
01:13:31,647 --> 01:13:33,183
And Alex's

1479
01:13:33,439 --> 01:13:33,951
Exclusion

1480
01:13:34,463 --> 01:13:36,255
And I don't know I don't understand

1481
01:13:36,511 --> 01:13:37,279
How anybody

1482
01:13:37,535 --> 01:13:38,303
Looking at the past

1483
01:13:38,559 --> 01:13:39,071
Through history

1484
01:13:39,327 --> 01:13:40,095
Kim Kim

1485
01:13:40,351 --> 01:13:42,399
Honestly think that that's a good Gamble

1486
01:13:42,911 --> 01:13:44,447
Like I don't understand why people think

1487
01:13:44,703 --> 01:13:47,263
That would work out well it always is

1488
01:13:47,519 --> 01:13:49,055
Exclusion is always wrong

1489
01:13:50,079 --> 01:13:50,847
Even though it sometimes

1490
01:13:51,871 --> 01:13:56,735
Go back to that Ebola episode that we did

1491
01:13:57,247 --> 01:13:57,759
Wrong things

1492
01:13:58,783 --> 01:14:00,575
It's just a a sort of

1493
01:14:00,831 --> 01:14:02,111
New jerk reaction

1494
01:14:02,879 --> 01:14:03,647
But if you ever start

1495
01:14:05,951 --> 01:14:06,719
It's the wrong thing

1496
01:14:06,975 --> 01:14:07,743
It'll be looks poorly

1497
01:14:08,255 --> 01:14:08,767
Alex

1498
01:14:09,279 --> 01:14:15,423
I mean f****** Apes that have destroyed the one place that allowed us to exist

1499
01:14:16,447 --> 01:14:16,959
So

1500
01:14:17,215 --> 01:14:21,311
Of course we're going to continue this right because we have these f****** Apes continue

1501
01:14:21,567 --> 01:14:26,431
Wake me up there not good

1502
01:14:28,223 --> 01:14:33,343
My dad is God bless you great job is going tonight 7 central eastern for

1503
01:14:33,855 --> 01:14:36,671
Emergency

1504
01:14:37,183 --> 01:14:40,255
How old is going to end

1505
01:14:46,911 --> 01:14:47,935
Call man

1506
01:14:48,191 --> 01:14:49,471
She's so excited though

1507
01:14:49,727 --> 01:14:52,799
Yeah but they're excited because

1508
01:14:53,311 --> 01:14:54,335
Authoritarian

1509
01:14:54,591 --> 01:14:57,151
Resume he's in favor of being implemented

1510
01:14:57,407 --> 01:15:00,223
It's crazy to be obvious

1511
01:15:00,479 --> 01:15:00,991
Like what

1512
01:15:01,247 --> 01:15:03,295
Mental state

1513
01:15:03,807 --> 01:15:04,575
Pieces in here

1514
01:15:04,831 --> 01:15:05,855
That's what that

1515
01:15:08,159 --> 01:15:10,719
So now it's funny that you takes

1516
01:15:10,975 --> 01:15:11,743
Tour for the last

1517
01:15:12,255 --> 01:15:16,351
Hour of his show and talks to this guy who runs a site called Black

1518
01:15:16,607 --> 01:15:17,631
Pill.com

1519
01:15:23,775 --> 01:15:29,919
I don't know if you saw my God

1520
01:15:30,175 --> 01:15:32,735
If you agree with him

1521
01:15:33,503 --> 01:15:39,647
Particular format

1522
01:15:45,279 --> 01:15:46,303
I think it's

1523
01:15:52,959 --> 01:15:59,103
Different

1524
01:16:00,127 --> 01:16:01,663
We're just real quick I don't mean to

1525
01:16:02,175 --> 01:16:02,687
Dismissive

1526
01:16:03,199 --> 01:16:03,967
Complaint although I am

1527
01:16:04,479 --> 01:16:06,271
I think also that genre kind of

1528
01:16:06,527 --> 01:16:08,575
Itself out I think that's why you

1529
01:16:08,831 --> 01:16:10,367
Remakes of all of the like Dave the

1530
01:16:10,879 --> 01:16:16,511
So you just be all these remakes that the people who explored those ideas

1531
01:16:16,767 --> 01:16:17,791
Really well

1532
01:16:18,047 --> 01:16:21,631
I know that they're probably examples of newer movies that

1533
01:16:21,887 --> 01:16:22,399
I'd like to take on

1534
01:16:22,911 --> 01:16:26,751
An interesting Twist on stuff

1535
01:16:27,263 --> 01:16:28,287
Smith making a red state

1536
01:16:28,799 --> 01:16:34,943
Directions

1537
01:16:35,199 --> 01:16:36,223
Red-state

1538
01:16:37,759 --> 01:16:38,271
Also

1539
01:16:38,527 --> 01:16:41,343
Who did he think started

1540
01:16:42,111 --> 01:16:48,255
Lego who does Hebrew

1541
01:16:48,511 --> 01:16:54,143
Post-apocalyptic movies of the 1950s were started by conservatives

1542
01:16:54,399 --> 01:17:00,543
Do you think the f****** Godzilla was started by Conservative Business

1543
01:17:00,799 --> 01:17:01,311
The greatest

1544
01:17:01,567 --> 01:17:03,871
The world is f***** up movie there's ever been

1545
01:17:04,127 --> 01:17:05,151
This is a minor point

1546
01:17:05,407 --> 01:17:09,247
I just I would I would bring my rebuttal

1547
01:17:09,759 --> 01:17:11,551
I don't think there's much more interesting

1548
01:17:11,807 --> 01:17:14,623
Territory to cover I think we've done the

1549
01:17:14,879 --> 01:17:21,023
Society falling apart are people going to get along are they going to fight that's why Survivor you can only watch like three or four season

1550
01:17:21,279 --> 01:17:24,351
How many seasons of it

1551
01:17:24,607 --> 01:17:26,911
I have more tolerance

1552
01:17:27,167 --> 01:17:27,935
Theme song

1553
01:17:28,191 --> 01:17:30,751
Maybe I also kind of enjoyed Jeff Probst

1554
01:17:31,519 --> 01:17:34,079
Really certain charms

1555
01:17:34,591 --> 01:17:35,103
My buddy Nick

1556
01:17:35,871 --> 01:17:37,151
Had the best idea in the world

1557
01:17:37,407 --> 01:17:38,943
Getting on Survivor

1558
01:17:39,455 --> 01:17:45,599
Kidnap Jeff Probst make him the authoritarian dictator

1559
01:17:48,927 --> 01:17:49,695
We go to tribal

1560
01:17:52,511 --> 01:17:53,023
We all vote

1561
01:17:53,535 --> 01:17:57,631
Jeff Probst

1562
01:17:57,887 --> 01:18:02,495
I got the first love you like

1563
01:18:02,751 --> 01:18:03,263
Jeff Probst

1564
01:18:03,519 --> 01:18:06,335
Alright guy

1565
01:18:06,591 --> 01:18:08,127
Keppra

1566
01:18:08,383 --> 01:18:12,223
Hey we're still doing a show can we get can we get the producer in here

1567
01:18:12,479 --> 01:18:13,247
Would they redo it

1568
01:18:14,783 --> 01:18:17,855
But they might

1569
01:18:18,111 --> 01:18:18,623
My point is

1570
01:18:18,879 --> 01:18:19,903
Tunica gift the funny guy

1571
01:18:20,415 --> 01:18:22,207
Is criticism so far

1572
01:18:22,463 --> 01:18:24,511
His soft pitbull shepherd box

1573
01:18:37,823 --> 01:18:43,967
I wonder what your problem there is

1574
01:18:44,223 --> 01:18:50,367
Anything about

1575
01:19:03,423 --> 01:19:09,567
Normalizing

1576
01:19:09,823 --> 01:19:11,103
Real quick

1577
01:19:11,359 --> 01:19:12,895
First is the

1578
01:19:13,151 --> 01:19:16,735
Is liberal propaganda flytrap

1579
01:19:16,991 --> 01:19:18,271
People who identify

1580
01:19:18,527 --> 01:19:22,623
Is lgbtq and interracial relationship

1581
01:19:22,879 --> 01:19:29,023
Whoa whoa whoa whoa

1582
01:19:29,279 --> 01:19:32,351
What's what's next

1583
01:19:32,863 --> 01:19:35,679
What's next damn book I love a nice

1584
01:19:35,935 --> 01:19:37,215
You know I look

1585
01:19:37,471 --> 01:19:43,615
I can't come up with the genre

1586
01:19:43,871 --> 01:19:49,759
What the f*** you liberal ideas liberals convinced

1587
01:19:50,015 --> 01:19:52,319
Captain Kirk to kiss a black woman

1588
01:19:52,575 --> 01:19:57,183
If such propaganda

1589
01:19:57,439 --> 01:19:58,719
That's crazy to me

1590
01:20:01,023 --> 01:20:02,303
If you want to make a point

1591
01:20:02,559 --> 01:20:03,583
I'd encourage you not to

1592
01:20:04,607 --> 01:20:06,143
Cuz it makes you sound like

1593
01:20:06,399 --> 01:20:07,679
You don't want races dating

1594
01:20:07,935 --> 01:20:11,263
I like

1595
01:20:11,519 --> 01:20:12,799
The old movie

1596
01:20:13,311 --> 01:20:14,336
Where you weren't

1597
01:20:14,592 --> 01:20:18,944
Going to see kind of interracial touching

1598
01:20:21,504 --> 01:20:22,784
Unless it's violent

1599
01:20:26,368 --> 01:20:27,136
Whiteman

1600
01:20:27,392 --> 01:20:28,416
And white women

1601
01:20:28,672 --> 01:20:31,744
Kissing both of them within their perfect gender roles

1602
01:20:39,168 --> 01:20:45,312
Have to turn this culture into something that has more

1603
01:20:45,568 --> 01:20:49,664
Flavor in everything I just want

1604
01:20:51,968 --> 01:20:52,480
.

1605
01:20:52,736 --> 01:20:55,296
So from that criticism I gathered

1606
01:20:55,552 --> 01:20:57,600
Like just from

1607
01:21:00,160 --> 01:21:02,208
I meant second from a

1608
01:21:02,464 --> 01:21:08,608
You're apparently against interracial relationships of lgbtq

1609
01:21:08,864 --> 01:21:13,216
Brooks brother on Syfy is

1610
01:21:15,776 --> 01:21:16,288
So

1611
01:21:18,336 --> 01:21:20,384
To talk about how like all the bad guys are

1612
01:21:20,640 --> 01:21:21,152
Are white

1613
01:21:25,760 --> 01:21:29,088
I just did the jack off motion

1614
01:21:29,600 --> 01:21:35,744
Website.com

1615
01:21:39,072 --> 01:21:40,608
But you want to blackfield

1616
01:21:40,864 --> 01:21:45,984
Dot-com took me awhile to find the page

1617
01:21:46,240 --> 01:21:46,752
You look at it

1618
01:21:47,008 --> 01:21:48,288
There's problems

1619
01:21:49,312 --> 01:21:53,664
Give the Articles and videos he's made with titles like quote no white guilt

1620
01:21:53,920 --> 01:21:56,480
Or quote why they want to replace you

1621
01:21:56,736 --> 01:21:57,760
Which literally argues

1622
01:21:58,016 --> 01:21:58,528
The people in country

1623
01:21:58,784 --> 01:22:01,856
Trees with more oppressive governments like Argentina have lower eye

1624
01:22:02,112 --> 01:22:02,624
Accused

1625
01:22:02,880 --> 01:22:03,392
Exhausted

1626
01:22:03,648 --> 01:22:04,160
The powers-that-be

1627
01:22:04,672 --> 01:22:05,440
Make everyone closer

1628
01:22:05,696 --> 01:22:07,232
In order to install

1629
01:22:07,488 --> 01:22:08,000
Government

1630
01:22:08,256 --> 01:22:09,024
Beyond that

1631
01:22:09,536 --> 01:22:11,072
We spent a bunch of time covering her Pizza

1632
01:22:11,584 --> 01:22:13,376
Is totally real and of course the Seth rich

1633
01:22:13,632 --> 01:22:14,400
Conspiracy uzalo

1634
01:22:14,656 --> 01:22:15,424
Do that naturally

1635
01:22:15,680 --> 01:22:17,728
He's a good fit for Alex's a fellow nut

1636
01:22:17,984 --> 01:22:20,288
Unless you want to bring up one of the posts

1637
01:22:20,544 --> 01:22:22,080
Somebody year ago that he made

1638
01:22:22,336 --> 01:22:23,104
Particularly funny

1639
01:22:23,616 --> 01:22:26,944
Which is just titled quote Bill Cooper warned about Deeds

1640
01:22:27,200 --> 01:22:28,224
Years ago

1641
01:22:28,480 --> 01:22:31,040
Did Alex

1642
01:22:31,552 --> 01:22:32,064
Cuz he loves

1643
01:22:34,368 --> 01:22:34,880
Encouraging

1644
01:22:35,392 --> 01:22:35,904
Racial other

1645
01:22:36,928 --> 01:22:37,952
God creating

1646
01:22:38,208 --> 01:22:38,720
Depression-era

1647
01:22:39,232 --> 01:22:39,744
Throughout his work

1648
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:40,768
That's what he's doing

1649
01:22:41,024 --> 01:22:42,048
That's the entire purpose

1650
01:22:43,584 --> 01:22:44,608
Anyway I don't have much

1651
01:22:44,864 --> 01:22:45,632
Perspective this guy think

1652
01:22:45,888 --> 01:22:46,400
Kind of sucks

1653
01:22:46,656 --> 01:22:48,704
Is interviews actually really boring

1654
01:22:48,960 --> 01:22:49,472
But

1655
01:22:49,728 --> 01:22:50,752
Sandra Bullock

1656
01:22:51,008 --> 01:22:51,776
Is a an

1657
01:22:52,288 --> 01:22:53,312
Bird Box

1658
01:22:53,824 --> 01:22:54,848
I didn't know that cuz I had

1659
01:22:55,104 --> 01:22:55,616
Haven't seen it

1660
01:22:56,128 --> 01:22:56,896
Do you know

1661
01:22:58,432 --> 01:23:02,016
Something about Sandra I don't know anything

1662
01:23:02,528 --> 01:23:03,040
What's that

1663
01:23:03,552 --> 01:23:09,696
Do lizards that's a running joke that we

1664
01:23:09,952 --> 01:23:12,256
For a while

1665
01:23:12,512 --> 01:23:14,048
Delivered poorly

1666
01:23:15,072 --> 01:23:17,632
Bring it up because

1667
01:23:17,888 --> 01:23:18,400
Take this opportunity

1668
01:23:19,168 --> 01:23:20,192
Really just

1669
01:23:22,240 --> 01:23:22,752
Custom swing

1670
01:23:31,712 --> 01:23:37,856
But she is a monstrous pig total PR was stabbed in the back is a psychopath

1671
01:23:38,112 --> 01:23:44,256
Monster

1672
01:23:44,512 --> 01:23:47,840
The soccer film

1673
01:23:49,120 --> 01:23:51,424
He knows where he's at

1674
01:23:51,680 --> 01:23:56,800
Neo-Nazi Jesse sheet divorce

1675
01:23:57,056 --> 01:23:57,568
Affected

1676
01:23:58,080 --> 01:23:58,592
Adopt

1677
01:23:58,848 --> 01:23:59,360
Did minority

1678
01:24:00,384 --> 01:24:02,176
Like I don't know it seems

1679
01:24:02,432 --> 01:24:08,576
Brick redundant and kind of overly simplistic to assume that's part of it

1680
01:24:08,832 --> 01:24:09,600
I know that these friends

1681
01:24:09,856 --> 01:24:11,136
Jesse James

1682
01:24:11,392 --> 01:24:12,160
Is a hundred percent

1683
01:24:12,416 --> 01:24:12,928
At least

1684
01:24:13,184 --> 01:24:14,720
Pretty cool with not

1685
01:24:15,232 --> 01:24:16,000
Alex

1686
01:24:16,512 --> 01:24:17,024
The two of them

1687
01:24:18,304 --> 01:24:20,864
Information to Jesse James has told him

1688
01:24:21,632 --> 01:24:24,704
If you know enough about Alex you know that what he's reporting autism

1689
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:27,264
The guy that she divorced

1690
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:33,664
Was talking a lot of s*** to me and I know secret s*** I know secret stuff from the jilted lover

1691
01:24:33,920 --> 01:24:36,480
If that is that is in source

1692
01:24:36,736 --> 01:24:42,880
Jesse James the only reason she divorced him because it's bad PR to be with a nothing

1693
01:24:43,136 --> 01:24:44,928
Do suggest that witch

1694
01:24:45,696 --> 01:24:46,464

Whatever few episodes episodes

01:25:15,392 --> 01:25:17,184
This just turned into a gossip

1705
01:25:17,952 --> 01:25:20,000
Now it's a apocalyptic

1706
01:25:21,536 --> 01:25:25,632
Authoritarian

1707
01:25:26,400 --> 01:25:28,448

1713
01:25:38,176 --> 01:25:40,992
Biggity

1714
01:25:42,272 --> 01:25:48,416

Powder Elite Owen Shroyer takeover on the War Room

Gets his bearings about him

1722
01:26:12,736 --> 01:26:13,504
And comes back

1723
01:26:14,016 --> 01:26:16,576
With a live report for the live coverage of trump

1724
01:26:16,832 --> 01:26:17,856
Obviously

1725
01:26:18,112 --> 01:26:24,256
Declaring a state of emergency on broadcast TV everybody knows that that's what he's going to do

1726
01:26:26,048 --> 01:26:29,120
Heatedly throughout the show

1727
01:26:29,376 --> 01:26:30,656
The beginning of this

1728
01:26:30,912 --> 01:26:32,448
Episode live

1729
01:26:33,216 --> 01:26:33,728
Very boy

1730
01:26:35,776 --> 01:26:36,800
But about to

1731
01:26:37,824 --> 01:26:40,640
Call Nora cell

1732
01:26:40,896 --> 01:26:42,176
Alex frames what's going

1733
01:26:42,432 --> 01:26:42,944
To happen

1734
01:26:44,224 --> 01:26:46,528
The president

1735
01:26:46,784 --> 01:26:49,344
His first Oval Office address

1736
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:52,416
Is it always a special dress tomorrow we don't know if it'll be a lobster.

1737
01:26:54,464 --> 01:26:55,488
Protection one came through

1738
01:26:59,328 --> 01:27:00,864
The shed

1739
01:27:01,632 --> 01:27:02,656
We are in

1740
01:27:03,168 --> 01:27:04,704
National price

1741
01:27:06,752 --> 01:27:08,800
We are in a national

1742
01:27:09,056 --> 01:27:09,824
Prices

1743
01:27:10,848 --> 01:27:13,152
Do we declare a crisis

1744
01:27:13,408 --> 01:27:15,200
Is it a bargaining chip

1745
01:27:15,712 --> 01:27:17,248
Is that what this is

1746
01:27:17,760 --> 01:27:18,784
Is this a

1747
01:27:19,040 --> 01:27:20,064
Bargaining chip

1748
01:27:21,344 --> 01:27:24,928
So the Democrats stop holding the shutdown government

1749
01:27:25,184 --> 01:27:27,744
Anyways

1750
01:27:29,024 --> 01:27:34,656
Tonight by Pelosi and Schumer

1751
01:27:36,192 --> 01:27:39,008
But he needs it for the Emergency because again we clear Obama

1752
01:27:40,032 --> 01:27:42,336
Executive order 2012

1753
01:27:42,592 --> 01:27:45,664
But at least a dozen more the truck

1754
01:27:45,920 --> 01:27:47,712
Named after that

1755
01:27:48,224 --> 01:27:50,016
Martial law

1756
01:27:52,576 --> 01:27:54,112
Dictatorial power

1757
01:27:56,672 --> 01:28:00,512
Whatever agency in groups

1758
01:28:00,768 --> 01:28:02,560
Groups 12

1759
01:28:04,608 --> 01:28:07,168
You've made it clear the only way Trump isn't

1760
01:28:07,424 --> 01:28:08,704
Staying at the national bird

1761
01:28:09,216 --> 01:28:12,032
It comes out in and out of the deal that exactly

1762
01:28:12,288 --> 01:28:15,360
Through a dick on the table

1763
01:28:15,616 --> 01:28:21,760
Pelosi and Schumer cowered in fear and you know that they would if he didn't

1764
01:28:22,016 --> 01:28:28,160
Be back out because you know they have a history of backing out of feels unlike the very person who had a deal in place to continue funding

1765
01:28:28,416 --> 01:28:32,256
The government and then because of dickwad like Alex Jones and Sean Hannity

1766
01:28:32,512 --> 01:28:34,304
Then went back on

1767
01:28:34,560 --> 01:28:36,608
You know you can't trust Pelosi

1768
01:28:37,120 --> 01:28:41,984
Where's all that great loclivin

1769
01:28:42,240 --> 01:28:42,752
Great Clips

1770
01:28:43,008 --> 01:28:43,776
Confined of trump talk

1771
01:28:45,056 --> 01:28:47,360
I'm going to shut down the government

1772
01:28:47,616 --> 01:28:53,760
He literally said it is going to be my fault I will accept

1773
01:28:56,064 --> 01:28:57,088
The other ones are dragging their

1774
01:28:57,344 --> 01:28:58,368
4 ft

1775
01:29:00,160 --> 01:29:01,952
I just need stress because

1776
01:29:02,464 --> 01:29:02,976
No

1777
01:29:03,232 --> 01:29:03,744
After the fact

1778
01:29:04,768 --> 01:29:05,536
Declare National

1779
01:29:06,048 --> 01:29:08,608
Just spouted a bunch of bulshit

1780
01:29:09,632 --> 01:29:13,472
How do you know that I didn't watch it because

1781
01:29:13,728 --> 01:29:19,872
Cuz I'm not watching that it was all just a manipulation of the

1782
01:29:20,128 --> 01:29:20,896
Reality of the

1783
01:29:21,664 --> 01:29:22,688
On the Border trying to make

1784
01:29:24,224 --> 01:29:24,736
Is listing

1785
01:29:24,992 --> 01:29:28,320
People who have been killed by immigrants yeah

1786
01:29:29,600 --> 01:29:30,880
White nationalist

1787
01:29:31,136 --> 01:29:33,440
Display

1788
01:29:33,952 --> 01:29:35,744
He was absolutely just a like

1789
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:41,888
We need to be afraid of these people flooding into our country

1790
01:29:42,400 --> 01:29:43,424
The crisis of the Soul

1791
01:29:43,680 --> 01:29:44,960
He was appealing on like a

1792
01:29:45,216 --> 01:29:46,496
Hypothetically moral level

1793
01:29:46,752 --> 01:29:47,264
Like trying to

1794
01:29:47,520 --> 01:29:48,544
The moral

1795
01:29:49,056 --> 01:29:50,848
In terms of like we need to do this

1796
01:29:51,104 --> 01:29:53,408
He appealed to the opiate crisis and like

1797
01:29:53,920 --> 01:30:00,064
Truck off this would help with that at all I know who

1798
01:30:00,320 --> 01:30:01,344
Wrote that speech

1799
01:30:01,600 --> 01:30:07,744
Steven.

1800
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:10,304
Surprisingly enough

1801
01:30:10,560 --> 01:30:11,840
Yeah I just feel that way

1802
01:30:12,352 --> 01:30:13,376
Now that's an old reference

1803
01:30:13,632 --> 01:30:15,168
So Alex gets

1804
01:30:16,448 --> 01:30:17,216
This next clip

1805
01:30:17,728 --> 01:30:18,240
I legitimately

1806
01:30:20,032 --> 01:30:21,056
Is soda

1807
01:30:21,312 --> 01:30:21,824
Disqualifying

1808
01:30:22,080 --> 01:30:23,616
Alex has no idea what he's

1809
01:30:23,872 --> 01:30:24,384
He's talking about

1810
01:30:27,200 --> 01:30:30,272
No one has ever used a National Emergency set Ronald Reagan

1811
01:30:30,784 --> 01:30:33,856
Limited one that use National Emergency to order the air traffic controllers

1812
01:30:34,368 --> 01:30:40,512
Dollar planes crashing faultless Kylie said

1813
01:30:40,768 --> 01:30:41,536
Does all 50 states

1814
01:30:42,048 --> 01:30:44,096
We're gone

1815
01:30:44,352 --> 01:30:46,400
He said no you get back to work I'll have your address

1816
01:30:47,936 --> 01:30:52,032
Now Congress

1817
01:30:55,104 --> 01:30:56,640
Here's the deal

1818
01:30:56,896 --> 01:30:59,968
Out of a hundred percent wrong about the story and it really illustrate

1819
01:31:00,224 --> 01:31:01,504
A deep lack of understanding

1820
01:31:01,760 --> 01:31:02,528
On the topic

1821
01:31:02,784 --> 01:31:03,296
He's covering

1822
01:31:03,808 --> 01:31:06,368
In August 1981 the professional air traffic

1823
01:31:06,624 --> 01:31:07,392
Controllers organization

1824
01:31:07,648 --> 01:31:08,672
Found themselves on strike

1825
01:31:08,928 --> 01:31:10,720
Across-the-board pay raises

1826
01:31:10,976 --> 01:31:15,328
And more lenient to the hours of their work weeks given the 24/7 nature of their job

1827
01:31:15,840 --> 01:31:16,608
13000

1828
01:31:17,120 --> 01:31:18,656
Controllers walked out and negotiate

1829
01:31:18,912 --> 01:31:24,544
I'm going August 3rd wasn't going to give

1830
01:31:25,056 --> 01:31:26,848
Brigandine the strikes be illegal

1831
01:31:27,104 --> 01:31:29,152
And threatened to fire anyone can go back to work

1832
01:31:29,408 --> 01:31:30,176
Within 48 hours

1833
01:31:30,944 --> 01:31:32,736
11000 controllers

1834
01:31:33,248 --> 01:31:35,040
And Reagan stood to his word inspired

1835
01:31:35,296 --> 01:31:38,624
Even going so far as to put lifetime bans on them being rehired

1836
01:31:38,880 --> 01:31:41,440
Unfortunately the scabs who didn't stand

1837
01:31:41,696 --> 01:31:42,720
Their fellow workers

1838
01:31:42,976 --> 01:31:46,048
We're enough proximately 80%

1839
01:31:46,304 --> 01:31:46,816
Commercial Tower

1840
01:31:47,328 --> 01:31:49,120
And the freight industry ran it.

1841
01:31:49,888 --> 01:31:50,656
I'm just like that

1842
01:31:50,912 --> 01:31:52,192
A dick head president

1843
01:31:52,448 --> 01:31:53,728
Crippling blow to labor rights

1844
01:31:53,984 --> 01:31:54,496
Country

1845
01:31:54,752 --> 01:32:00,384
On full display in front of national media everyone so exactly what would happen to organized labor

1846
01:32:00,640 --> 01:32:01,408
The power of the government

1847
01:32:01,664 --> 01:32:03,200
They will be threatened and those

1848
01:32:03,456 --> 01:32:04,992
Fall in line be fired fine

1849
01:32:05,504 --> 01:32:06,272
A potentially band

1850
01:32:06,528 --> 01:32:07,552
And for life from their profession

1851
01:32:08,320 --> 01:32:11,392
Federal employees don't have the right to strike

1852
01:32:11,648 --> 01:32:13,184
Thursday did he should just fire them

1853
01:32:13,440 --> 01:32:14,720
Based on the taft-hartley ACT

1854
01:32:15,488 --> 01:32:16,000
47

1855
01:32:16,256 --> 01:32:17,792
This had been done previously

1856
01:32:18,304 --> 01:32:21,888
And most people believe that the circumstances ever came up a modern president

1857
01:32:22,144 --> 01:32:22,656
Be so shity

1858
01:32:22,912 --> 01:32:26,496
It's actually summarily Fire Federal Employees were demanding better working

1859
01:32:27,264 --> 01:32:29,056
But those people had never met

1860
01:32:29,824 --> 01:32:32,896
Many consider the event to be one of the most important in the history of uni

1861
01:32:33,152 --> 01:32:33,664
Boston

1862
01:32:33,920 --> 01:32:35,456
And the moment that ripple effect

1863
01:32:35,712 --> 01:32:36,224
Tons of Indus

1864
01:32:37,248 --> 01:32:38,784
Just those fired workers along

1865
01:32:39,040 --> 01:32:42,112
But at no point did Reagan declare a national emergency

1866
01:32:42,880 --> 01:32:46,208
How to inflate the idea of of a strike

1867
01:32:46,464 --> 01:32:49,792
And this government shutdown and this National Emergency narrative

1868
01:32:50,048 --> 01:32:52,608
What's going on which all of them are in no way related

1869
01:32:52,864 --> 01:32:55,936
But in doing so what are you saying is that no other president has

1870
01:32:56,192 --> 01:32:57,216
Has declared a state of emergency

1871
01:32:57,728 --> 01:32:58,496
Except Reagan

1872
01:32:58,752 --> 01:33:00,544
Which is absolutely not true

1873
01:33:01,568 --> 01:33:04,384
T3 people voted on the Federal Reserve

1874
01:33:04,896 --> 01:33:06,688
Emergency declared

1875
01:33:06,944 --> 01:33:13,088
Reagan didn't declare National Emergency

1876
01:33:13,344 --> 01:33:16,416
National

1877
01:33:16,928 --> 01:33:19,488
In effect

1878
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:20,512
MacArthur

1879
01:33:21,536 --> 01:33:24,608
Nearly all of them 25 out of the 28

1880
01:33:24,864 --> 01:33:25,888
Freezing on the property

1881
01:33:26,144 --> 01:33:28,704
The people involved various regimes we've not like

1882
01:33:28,960 --> 01:33:30,752
More people were working to disrupt

1883
01:33:31,008 --> 01:33:32,544
Peace processes in countries

1884
01:33:33,056 --> 01:33:35,616
Like Belarus in 2006

1885
01:33:35,872 --> 01:33:36,384
2003

1886
01:33:36,640 --> 01:33:37,664
Or the Western Balkans

1887
01:33:37,920 --> 01:33:38,688
2001

1888
01:33:38,944 --> 01:33:40,224
Exactly

1889
01:33:40,480 --> 01:33:41,248
You'd expect to see

1890
01:33:41,504 --> 01:33:45,344
There's one from 1994 about the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction

1891
01:33:45,856 --> 01:33:48,416
There's one from night from 911 about terrorists

1892
01:33:48,928 --> 01:33:53,280
You can make whatever argument you want about these National emergencies for or against

1893
01:33:53,536 --> 01:33:58,656
Duck ready to talk about that I'm willing to hear both sides were probably very unnecessary

1894
01:33:58,912 --> 01:34:02,240
There might be a good hey I'm not again

1895
01:34:02,496 --> 01:34:04,544
What's the National Emergency about the idea of the

1896
01:34:04,800 --> 01:34:06,848
The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction

1897
01:34:07,104 --> 01:34:07,616
I also think we

1898
01:34:07,872 --> 01:34:08,896
We should be subject

1899
01:34:09,408 --> 01:34:11,200
The conversation

1900
01:34:11,456 --> 01:34:11,968
Have

1901
01:34:12,224 --> 01:34:12,736
But

1902
01:34:13,504 --> 01:34:15,808
You can't make a coherent argument that their secret

1903
01:34:16,320 --> 01:34:18,112
Or that somehow by declaring them

1904
01:34:18,368 --> 01:34:19,904
Any president has gained the ability to

1905
01:34:20,160 --> 01:34:22,208
Declare martial law

1906
01:34:22,720 --> 01:34:24,000
I'm not saying this to be a dick

1907
01:34:24,512 --> 01:34:28,352
That is literally with Alex Jones and Larry Nichols were arguing in the run-up to

1908
01:34:28,608 --> 01:34:29,632
The 2016 election

1909
01:34:30,144 --> 01:34:32,192
Did Obama was going to declare state of emergency

1910
01:34:32,704 --> 01:34:35,008
Evie FEMA provisional government would kick in

1911
01:34:35,264 --> 01:34:36,544
And then he become king

1912
01:34:37,056 --> 01:34:38,848
I just so no one thinks I'm making that up

1913
01:34:39,104 --> 01:34:39,872
Here's them saying

1914
01:34:40,640 --> 01:34:46,784
Call Antoinette Obama was elected we were thank God racist

1915
01:34:47,040 --> 01:34:49,600
Everything in and then shop

1916
01:34:50,112 --> 01:34:51,392
To make raised

1917
01:34:51,904 --> 01:34:54,720
Water issue now than the day the man came in

1918
01:34:55,744 --> 01:35:01,888
If you don't believe he is

1919
01:35:02,400 --> 01:35:08,544
The riots get activated out of Cheers Bar people don't understand when these Blackbob start run

1920
01:35:08,800 --> 01:35:13,152
Shooting wildly into the neighborhood people are doing this country

1921
01:35:13,920 --> 01:35:18,272
Call up and say please in the government and stop it protect us

1922
01:35:19,040 --> 01:35:24,672
We will call for the federal government to come in and protected we will call for the civil emergency

1923
01:35:25,952 --> 01:35:29,792
We'll be the ones asking because

1924
01:35:36,704 --> 01:35:40,544
Talk about years ago

1925
01:35:40,800 --> 01:35:44,640
Another program

1926
01:35:45,920 --> 01:35:46,944
Stop.

1927
01:35:47,712 --> 01:35:53,856
Guillain-Barre was using if you'll recall Alex Jesse Jackson

1928
01:35:54,112 --> 01:35:55,392
Supposed to start

1929
01:35:55,904 --> 01:35:58,464
Riots in five major cities

1930
01:36:02,304 --> 01:36:06,400
And once I get the computer forever

1931
01:36:07,424 --> 01:36:10,240
We stopped it by making it public one now

1932
01:36:10,752 --> 01:36:12,288
We've got problems

1933
01:36:12,544 --> 01:36:15,872
The folks all of this that's going on is about

1934
01:36:26,368 --> 01:36:28,416
The thing that's going on today

1935
01:36:28,928 --> 01:36:30,464
You have to be so careful

1936
01:36:30,720 --> 01:36:33,792
So very careful McDonald's anytime

1937
01:36:34,048 --> 01:36:34,816
You know

1938
01:36:35,328 --> 01:36:41,472
Will you kill somebody

1939
01:36:41,728 --> 01:36:46,080
Total chaos happens

1940
01:36:46,592 --> 01:36:47,616
All bets are off

1941
01:36:49,408 --> 01:36:51,712
Sitting photo

1942
01:36:51,968 --> 01:36:57,856
When this thing collapses they become king or queen

1943
01:36:58,112 --> 01:37:01,440
I forgot to mention that Larry Nichols is also a huge racist

1944
01:37:02,976 --> 01:37:04,000
This is nonsense.

1945
01:37:04,512 --> 01:37:06,048
This is been there editorial position

1946
01:37:06,304 --> 01:37:06,816
Forever gif

1947
01:37:07,072 --> 01:37:07,584
Idea that

1948
01:37:07,840 --> 01:37:08,352
The president

1949
01:37:08,608 --> 01:37:09,120
Introduces

1950
01:37:09,632 --> 01:37:10,912
A national emergency

1951
01:37:11,168 --> 01:37:12,192
Regency weather

1952
01:37:12,448 --> 01:37:13,216
Misconception

1953
01:37:14,752 --> 01:37:16,288
Race riots

1954
01:37:16,544 --> 01:37:18,080
They're worried about

1955
01:37:18,336 --> 01:37:19,360
Whatever the situation

1956
01:37:20,128 --> 01:37:20,640
Created

1957
01:37:21,408 --> 01:37:21,920
Creative Nashua

1958
01:37:24,736 --> 01:37:25,504
But that is

1959
01:37:25,760 --> 01:37:26,272
That is

1960
01:37:28,832 --> 01:37:29,344
Skip

1961
01:37:35,232 --> 01:37:39,328
It's not so hard it's not he has no idea where are all the

1962
01:37:39,584 --> 01:37:40,352
National Emergency

1963
01:37:41,376 --> 01:37:41,888
Place forever

1964
01:37:43,680 --> 01:37:45,472
He literally said that Regan's the only

1965
01:37:46,752 --> 01:37:47,776
Yep that's crazy

1966
01:37:48,288 --> 01:37:48,800
Look

1967
01:37:49,056 --> 01:37:49,568
Here's the thing

1968
01:37:50,080 --> 01:37:51,104
We talked about this already

1969
01:37:51,360 --> 01:37:53,920
The idea that this is not an invalid

1970
01:37:55,712 --> 01:37:56,224
This is a

1971
01:37:56,992 --> 01:37:57,504
What it's always been

1972
01:37:58,016 --> 01:37:59,552
This is The Logical endpoint

1973
01:37:59,808 --> 01:38:00,576
Right right

1974
01:38:00,832 --> 01:38:02,368
You just be a glimpse

1975
01:38:02,624 --> 01:38:04,672
Through this that the curtain

1976
01:38:04,928 --> 01:38:05,952
Or whatever and you see

1977
01:38:06,208 --> 01:38:08,768
The Wizard of Oz is a race

1978
01:38:09,536 --> 01:38:10,304
More or less

1979
01:38:10,560 --> 01:38:13,120
The idea of anything else was just window-dressing

1980
01:38:13,632 --> 01:38:14,656
It really was

1981
01:38:14,912 --> 01:38:15,424
Yep

1982
01:38:15,680 --> 01:38:16,960
So please understand

1983
01:38:17,984 --> 01:38:19,264
This episode

1984
01:38:19,520 --> 01:38:20,032
To right now

1985
01:38:20,288 --> 01:38:23,360
Is a direct me or the night Alex stayed up all night

1986
01:38:23,616 --> 01:38:24,384
Watch WikiLeaks

1987
01:38:24,640 --> 01:38:25,664
Anniversary live stream

1988
01:38:26,176 --> 01:38:28,224
But he thought was going to be the night of Hillary's downfall

1989
01:38:28,736 --> 01:38:30,784
All that evening Alex. That is Magic

1990
01:38:31,040 --> 01:38:32,320
Smok

1991
01:38:32,832 --> 01:38:35,648
I was going to arrive and whisked Away to a post globalist

1992
01:38:36,416 --> 01:38:37,440
In Annapolis.

1993
01:38:37,696 --> 01:38:38,976
He said things but indicated

1994
01:38:39,232 --> 01:38:41,024
Rodger both headed

1995
01:38:41,280 --> 01:38:42,816
What was in those leaked emails

1996
01:38:43,584 --> 01:38:45,888
Unlike did not arrive that

1997
01:38:46,656 --> 01:38:48,192
In exactly the same way

1998
01:38:48,448 --> 01:38:50,752
You can easily set Alex's expected

1999
01:38:51,008 --> 01:38:52,288
Deus ex machina

2000
01:38:52,544 --> 01:38:54,080
Trump on January 8th

2001
01:38:54,336 --> 01:38:54,848
He thinks

2002
01:38:56,384 --> 01:38:56,896
After that

2003
01:38:57,152 --> 01:38:57,664
Who's going to be

2004
01:38:58,688 --> 01:38:59,200
In charge of the

2005
01:38:59,456 --> 01:39:02,528
Change of emergency as then it's genocide

2006
01:39:03,296 --> 01:39:03,808
And

2007
01:39:04,064 --> 01:39:08,416
You let you much slip that night when he was watching the song

2008
01:39:08,672 --> 01:39:10,976
Him and Rodger Stone let too much slip

2009
01:39:11,232 --> 01:39:11,744
Wilder

2010
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:12,512
Preparing

2011
01:39:12,768 --> 01:39:13,536
For Trump speech

2012
01:39:14,048 --> 01:39:15,072
On January

2013
01:39:16,096 --> 01:39:17,120
Rodger Stone

2014
01:39:17,376 --> 01:39:19,936
What do you predict tonight here in about 15 minutes

2015
01:39:20,960 --> 01:39:26,848
I think the president's I do think he is going to exercise his executive power

2016
01:39:27,104 --> 01:39:30,432
I do think he's going to appropriately declare an emergency

2017
01:39:30,688 --> 01:39:36,576
This is going to make the shift into high gear there will be

2018
01:39:36,832 --> 01:39:40,672
Because the president

2019
01:39:40,928 --> 01:39:44,000
Is bringing crime is bringing drugs is bringing disease

2020
01:39:48,096 --> 01:39:49,376
They favor a remix

2021
01:39:55,264 --> 01:39:57,568
In order to change.

2022
01:39:58,080 --> 01:39:59,360
I see the president

2023
01:39:59,616 --> 01:40:05,760
Going for broke tonight

2024
01:40:18,560 --> 01:40:22,400
Rodger that's what my gut tells me and my guts never wrong

2025
01:40:22,656 --> 01:40:25,472
So what is it Mike Adams

2026
01:40:25,728 --> 01:40:26,752
Earlier just

2027
01:40:27,008 --> 01:40:27,520
Really

2028
01:40:27,776 --> 01:40:28,288
Define

2029
01:40:28,800 --> 01:40:29,312
Authoritarian

2030
01:40:31,104 --> 01:40:31,616
Power

2031
01:40:31,872 --> 01:40:32,896
Rodger Stone

2032
01:40:33,152 --> 01:40:33,664
Direct

2033
01:40:33,920 --> 01:40:34,688
Describe

2034
01:40:34,944 --> 01:40:35,456
Dwight fashion

2035
01:40:36,480 --> 01:40:37,760
The idea of

2036
01:40:38,016 --> 01:40:41,088
These Outsiders coming in bring Crime and disease

2037
01:40:41,856 --> 01:40:44,160
Don Trump Jr with his

2038
01:40:44,416 --> 01:40:45,184
Sweet talkin about

2039
01:40:45,440 --> 01:40:46,976
Isuzu walls keep you safe

2040
01:40:47,232 --> 01:40:47,744
From the animal

2041
01:40:48,256 --> 01:40:49,536
Stuff like that

2042
01:40:49,792 --> 01:40:50,816
Humanizing ideas

2043
01:40:51,072 --> 01:40:53,376
All they bring is this horrible disease when they

2044
01:40:53,632 --> 01:40:55,936
Statistics don't match that at all no

2045
01:40:56,192 --> 01:40:57,728
I'd like reputable science

2046
01:40:57,984 --> 01:40:59,264
Back that up no

2047
01:40:59,520 --> 01:41:00,032
Nothing

2048
01:41:00,288 --> 01:41:00,800
Nothing

2049
01:41:01,056 --> 01:41:03,104
This is all the editorial position of

2050
01:41:03,360 --> 01:41:04,896
Infowars witches of white Nash

2051
01:41:05,664 --> 01:41:07,712
In describing the shifting of the elector

2052
01:41:08,224 --> 01:41:09,248
All that sort of thing

2053
01:41:09,760 --> 01:41:10,784
Devoting quotient

2054
01:41:11,296 --> 01:41:12,320
All that stuff is

2055
01:41:12,576 --> 01:41:13,600
All the fear of

2056
01:41:13,856 --> 01:41:15,392
Loss of white

2057
01:41:16,416 --> 01:41:17,440
And that is what

2058
01:41:17,696 --> 01:41:18,976
Important they believe

2059
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:20,512
Did Trump

2060
01:41:20,768 --> 01:41:22,560
Is going to declare the state of emergency

2061
01:41:22,816 --> 01:41:23,584
That will cry

2062
01:41:23,840 --> 01:41:25,888
Create

2063
01:41:26,400 --> 01:41:27,680
And it's like Bond villain

2064
01:41:27,936 --> 01:41:31,008
A certain extent

2065
01:41:31,264 --> 01:41:32,288
In Rodger Stone

2066
01:41:32,544 --> 01:41:34,080
Directly describes why

2067
01:41:34,592 --> 01:41:35,872
Nationalism white supremacy

2068
01:41:36,128 --> 01:41:41,248
There's a little slicker than to just save the same with it Mike

2069
01:41:45,088 --> 01:41:46,880
Blackpilled guy

2070
01:41:47,136 --> 01:41:50,208
But he still gets a little

2071
01:41:50,464 --> 01:41:51,744
Roblox

2072
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:53,280
The idea of we're going to protect

2073
01:41:53,536 --> 01:41:54,304
The electorate

2074
01:41:55,584 --> 01:41:57,888
But not too far off from Fox News in general

2075
01:41:58,400 --> 01:41:58,912
But they think

2076
01:42:03,008 --> 01:42:04,544
Any interesting things that I take away

2077
01:42:05,824 --> 01:42:07,104
Is that they don't know shitt

2078
01:42:07,872 --> 01:42:08,896
But you know I'm saying

2079
01:42:09,152 --> 01:42:10,944
Like it's interesting that they are so G

2080
01:42:11,968 --> 01:42:14,016
None of them have any inside information

2081
01:42:15,040 --> 01:42:18,624
They are way off guard by the idea that Trump is just

2082
01:42:19,648 --> 01:42:21,440
Just going to do a speech being a dick

2083
01:42:21,696 --> 01:42:22,976
He's not going to change anything

2084
01:42:23,488 --> 01:42:24,512
He think he is

2085
01:42:24,768 --> 01:42:25,536
And that means that our

2086
01:42:25,792 --> 01:42:26,560
Knows nothing

2087
01:42:27,072 --> 01:42:28,096
That means Rodger Stone.

2088
01:42:28,608 --> 01:42:29,632
Have any inside information

2089
01:42:30,144 --> 01:42:31,168
Everything is posture

2090
01:42:31,680 --> 01:42:32,704
But is posturing

2091
01:42:35,008 --> 01:42:35,520
Possibility

2092
01:42:35,776 --> 01:42:36,288
Hope

2093
01:42:36,544 --> 01:42:37,056
4

2094
01:42:42,176 --> 01:42:45,504
We're living in a time where old white people

2095
01:42:45,760 --> 01:42:46,784
Trying to

2096
01:42:47,296 --> 01:42:48,320
Hey I mean

2097
01:42:48,832 --> 01:42:49,600
In

2098
01:42:50,112 --> 01:42:50,624
I guess

2099
01:42:50,880 --> 01:42:54,208
Is the metaphor of their conception of what they think they're doing

2100
01:42:54,464 --> 01:42:56,000
They're trying to take

2101
01:42:56,512 --> 01:42:57,792
Like everybody's playing

2102
01:42:58,304 --> 01:43:02,656
Everybody's having a good time and it felt

2103
01:43:02,912 --> 01:43:04,448
Probably don't

2104
01:43:04,704 --> 01:43:06,752
Want them to know absolutely

2105
01:43:07,008 --> 01:43:09,824
The later generations

2106
01:43:12,640 --> 01:43:16,224
In their argument of course

2107
01:43:17,248 --> 01:43:21,088
If you continue with this authoritarian white nationalist fascist

2108
01:43:21,344 --> 01:43:24,928
It's only going to accelerate our impending death by climate

2109
01:43:25,440 --> 01:43:29,280
Like everything they're doing everything they're doing is like

2110
01:43:29,792 --> 01:43:35,168
It's going to be awesome to live in an authoritarian dictatorship because I'll be dead in 20 years

2111
01:43:35,424 --> 01:43:38,240
And only my children will have to deal with the real Fallout

2112
01:43:40,544 --> 01:43:41,312
Yeah you're right

2113
01:43:41,568 --> 01:43:42,336
So

2114
01:43:43,360 --> 01:43:44,384
Rodger goes on

2115
01:43:44,640 --> 01:43:47,200
You want to talk about how Russia is a bunch of nonsense

2116
01:43:47,968 --> 01:43:48,480
Respond

2117
01:43:48,736 --> 01:43:49,248
Like a rock

2118
01:43:51,552 --> 01:43:52,064
Also

2119
01:43:54,112 --> 01:43:54,880
Lawyers

2120
01:43:55,392 --> 01:44:00,256
Man they're bad but they're so bad

2121
01:44:01,280 --> 01:44:01,792
Redemption

2122
01:44:02,048 --> 01:44:04,608
People were able to find out what was under those black bars

2123
01:44:05,120 --> 01:44:06,400
And it turns out.

2124
01:44:06,656 --> 01:44:07,168
He had given

2125
01:44:08,960 --> 01:44:09,984
Russian spy

2126
01:44:10,496 --> 01:44:15,360
Allegedly

2127
01:44:15,872 --> 01:44:19,968
Which is a cry so like there's that stuff inside paint Rodger

2128
01:44:20,480 --> 01:44:22,528
Years you guys ran a business together

2129
01:44:22,784 --> 01:44:23,296
Took over

2130
01:44:26,368 --> 01:44:27,904
Not good great

2131
01:44:28,160 --> 01:44:28,928
So

2132
01:44:29,952 --> 01:44:31,488
Really wants to muddy the waters

2133
01:44:31,744 --> 01:44:33,024
About

2134
01:44:37,632 --> 01:44:39,936
With manafort Don Jr

2135
01:44:43,776 --> 01:44:48,896
She was a lawyer

2136
01:44:50,944 --> 01:44:57,088
Connections

2137
01:44:57,344 --> 01:45:00,928
And that's all good

2138
01:45:01,184 --> 01:45:01,696
Deflection

2139
01:45:02,208 --> 01:45:04,768
F****** weird

2140
01:45:05,024 --> 01:45:05,536
If I bring some

2141
01:45:05,792 --> 01:45:06,304
Personal stuff

2142
01:45:08,352 --> 01:45:09,120
Showing that he doesn't

2143
01:45:09,376 --> 01:45:09,888
I'm actually understand

2144
01:45:11,680 --> 01:45:15,264
Of the woman

2145
01:45:21,408 --> 01:45:24,480
Fusion GPS before and after the Trump Tower meeting

2146
01:45:32,672 --> 01:45:38,816
You advised me to go public I haven't yet I have told the FBI info

2147
01:45:39,072 --> 01:45:39,584
Dollars

2148
01:45:39,840 --> 01:45:42,656
Fusion GPS is actually a Central Intelligence Agency

2149
01:45:43,936 --> 01:45:46,752
Interfacing with the Russians to trip Russian

2150
01:45:47,008 --> 01:45:48,544
Espionage

2151
01:45:48,800 --> 01:45:53,408
Ticket defense department funding

2152
01:45:53,664 --> 01:45:55,712
Officially tried to shut me up

2153
01:45:56,224 --> 01:45:56,992
Really

2154
01:46:03,648 --> 01:46:06,208
Associative Factor doing this thing use this

2155
01:46:10,304 --> 01:46:12,864
They're using Russian networks that got in the US

2156
01:46:13,120 --> 01:46:14,400
It really work for the left

2157
01:46:14,656 --> 01:46:18,752
To try to set Patriots up to just talk to them or take money from them

2158
01:46:19,008 --> 01:46:20,288
Didn't claim this whole

2159
01:46:20,544 --> 01:46:21,824
Say crocheting is real

2160
01:46:22,080 --> 01:46:24,384
Is that the clintons others that sold us out

2161
01:46:24,640 --> 01:46:26,688
Directions to the factory

2162
01:46:27,200 --> 01:46:29,760
Russian woman who quite frankly

2163
01:46:30,272 --> 01:46:33,856
She was running around trying to get the guy

2164
01:46:36,672 --> 01:46:38,720
I'm having sex with all these Republican

2165
01:46:38,976 --> 01:46:42,560
Didn't talk to her thinking she was an Asian

2166
01:46:42,816 --> 01:46:43,328
Cho

2167
01:46:43,584 --> 01:46:44,864
This is all they've got

2168
01:46:45,376 --> 01:46:51,008
Quite shameful the Russian intelligence

2169
01:46:51,264 --> 01:46:52,544
My friend

2170
01:46:53,056 --> 01:46:57,920
There's a little bit of chauvinism misogyny in their butt

2171
01:46:58,176 --> 01:47:00,736
Rogers talking about

2172
01:47:01,248 --> 01:47:02,272
Alex starts yelling

2173
01:47:02,528 --> 01:47:03,296
Maria

2174
01:47:03,552 --> 01:47:04,064
Yeah

2175
01:47:04,576 --> 01:47:06,880
Different differences

2176
01:47:07,904 --> 01:47:09,696
Alex doesn't have a grasp on the facts

2177
01:47:09,952 --> 01:47:12,256
It shouldn't surprise us

2178
01:47:12,512 --> 01:47:13,024
No it's trying to say

2179
01:47:13,280 --> 01:47:14,816
Set you up

2180
01:47:15,328 --> 01:47:15,840
Have you tried to reach

2181
01:47:16,096 --> 01:47:22,240
Repurpose that artist where you got talk to buy Russian

2182
01:47:27,616 --> 01:47:31,456
Like this is a this is a good

2183
01:47:34,528 --> 01:47:35,552
That rooster phobic

2184
01:47:36,064 --> 01:47:37,088
Kind of Russian

2185
01:47:37,344 --> 01:47:39,904
But this is something that the Russian intelligence agencies

2186
01:47:40,160 --> 01:47:41,952
Often do which is say

2187
01:47:42,208 --> 01:47:47,072
We don't even have the capabilities of doing that people are trying to say that we're doing that

2188
01:47:47,328 --> 01:47:52,704
We couldn't even do that at all the time we talked about how low is there

2189
01:48:00,896 --> 01:48:02,432
Beautiful Central Security

2190
01:48:03,456 --> 01:48:04,224
Powerful strategy

2191
01:48:04,480 --> 01:48:05,248
But again it doesn't

2192
01:48:05,504 --> 01:48:11,648
Approve anything simple deflectors conversation

2193
01:48:11,904 --> 01:48:14,720
About this lawyer who had just been

2194
01:48:14,976 --> 01:48:17,024
Because he wants to

2195
01:48:17,280 --> 01:48:23,424
Talking about

2196
01:48:26,752 --> 01:48:28,544
GPS

2197
01:48:29,056 --> 01:48:31,104
So that gives a speech

2198
01:48:32,640 --> 01:48:34,176
It's just a bunch of.

2199
01:48:34,688 --> 01:48:35,456
Is complete

2200
01:48:36,480 --> 01:48:39,808
And so immediately afterwards Alex realizes

2201
01:48:40,064 --> 01:48:40,832
I thought he was

2202
01:48:41,856 --> 01:48:42,624
Starts

2203
01:48:43,904 --> 01:48:48,000
They threatened the budget of behind-the-scenes economic implosion your name and three that does

2204
01:48:50,560 --> 01:48:53,120
Predicted for the shot kind of figured he was going to do it

2205
01:48:53,376 --> 01:48:55,168
Things change and he says okay

2206
01:48:59,008 --> 01:49:00,544
But the Border

2207
01:49:00,800 --> 01:49:02,848
There's Potential Threat of sovereignty that's real

2208
01:49:03,616 --> 01:49:04,896
Excuse

2209
01:49:05,152 --> 01:49:06,944
Emergency under law

2210
01:49:08,480 --> 01:49:11,552
To get rid of all the globalist executive orders has Obama crap

2211
01:49:11,808 --> 01:49:14,368
No I'm not going to get from a total pass

2212
01:49:14,624 --> 01:49:16,160
Given 30 days from now

2213
01:49:16,928 --> 01:49:17,952
This hasn't worked out

2214
01:49:18,208 --> 01:49:20,000
Reverse executive orders

2215
01:49:20,512 --> 01:49:23,072
I'm going to think that they ever compromised Trump

2216
01:49:23,840 --> 01:49:26,656
He does this all the time these like fake

2217
01:49:30,240 --> 01:49:36,384
Remember 30 days prior to whenever the date is

2218
01:49:36,640 --> 01:49:37,408
Jill just conveniently

2219
01:49:37,664 --> 01:49:39,712
Play forget to cover the usmca

2220
01:49:39,968 --> 01:49:41,248
Getting ratified

2221
01:49:41,504 --> 01:49:43,040
Forget that was a Line in the Sand

2222
01:49:45,600 --> 01:49:48,672
It's that it's b******* but that's slick rationalization

2223
01:49:54,816 --> 01:49:55,328
It's just so

2224
01:49:56,352 --> 01:50:01,728
He spent the entire days and I know this is going to happen it's going to happen

2225
01:50:01,984 --> 01:50:03,264
Like letting there

2226
01:50:03,520 --> 01:50:04,288
Watch for

2227
01:50:04,544 --> 01:50:08,640
Authoritarianism show in preparation for it happening and then

2228
01:50:17,344 --> 01:50:20,160
Yeah yeah

2229
01:50:20,416 --> 01:50:21,184
Admits he was wrong

2230
01:50:21,440 --> 01:50:21,952
But also

2231
01:50:22,208 --> 01:50:28,096
Just a few moments ago

2232
01:50:28,608 --> 01:50:31,936
Trump is going to declare a National Emergency in his gut is never wrong

2233
01:50:32,448 --> 01:50:34,240
I think the earlier in the episode you did say that

2234
01:50:35,008 --> 01:50:41,152
We predicted this was all coming

2235
01:50:46,272 --> 01:50:49,088
This is what needs to be done we're not fetishizing

2236
01:50:49,600 --> 01:50:55,744
Civil emergency charging the power of executive that's literally

2237
01:50:56,000 --> 01:51:02,144
All you're doing

2238
01:51:07,776 --> 01:51:10,336
Especially now that he is not instituted one

2239
01:51:10,592 --> 01:51:14,176
And that kind of suggests that we're still not going to be okay if we keep

2240
01:51:14,432 --> 01:51:16,480
Authoritarian

2241
01:51:16,736 --> 01:51:18,784
We can only ask for an authoritarian

2242
01:51:19,040 --> 01:51:19,808
After it's already

2243
01:51:20,064 --> 01:51:20,576
Happen

2244
01:51:27,232 --> 01:51:32,864
Compromise

2245
01:51:33,376 --> 01:51:33,888
He also

2246
01:51:34,144 --> 01:51:34,656
Is drunk

2247
01:51:35,424 --> 01:51:38,240
He's not drunk in the same way that we seen him so many times

2248
01:51:38,752 --> 01:51:39,520
But there is a bit of it

2249
01:51:39,776 --> 01:51:44,640
Yeah it really demonstrates

2250
01:51:45,920 --> 01:51:47,712
How many words is he got into say

2251
01:51:47,968 --> 01:51:48,480
Not too many

2252
01:51:51,552 --> 01:51:52,320
But

2253
01:51:52,576 --> 01:51:53,600
Comes in

2254
01:51:53,856 --> 01:51:54,880
He starts trying to make

2255
01:51:56,928 --> 01:51:58,208
That we need to make our support of

2256
01:51:58,720 --> 01:51:59,488
Really public

2257
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:01,024
He's trying to make

2258
01:52:01,536 --> 01:52:03,840
Alex doesn't understand

2259
01:52:04,352 --> 01:52:04,864
And then start

2260
01:52:05,120 --> 01:52:09,472
To go out in public and wear our colors with pride

2261
01:52:09,984 --> 01:52:14,336
Because there's a big con right now there's a big sigh up on the American people

2262
01:52:14,592 --> 01:52:20,480
Trump supporters are in the minority Trump supporters donate raulito.

2263
01:52:20,736 --> 01:52:24,320
The only way if you are as my daughter narrative

2264
01:52:28,160 --> 01:52:30,720
Copy shop

2265
01:52:31,232 --> 01:52:32,512
On my way here

2266
01:52:38,144 --> 01:52:40,192
I can't even go to the gym anymore without

2267
01:52:40,704 --> 01:52:44,800
Your high school and college students recognizing me and saying how much they love infowar

2268
01:52:46,592 --> 01:52:47,872
Propaganda

2269
01:52:48,128 --> 01:52:49,408
Anton Yelchin

2270
01:52:49,664 --> 01:52:54,016
My oldest daughter I got three daughters

2271
01:52:58,112 --> 01:52:59,136
My daughter

2272
01:53:00,160 --> 01:53:04,256
Come pick me up

2273
01:53:04,512 --> 01:53:05,792
20 girls

2274
01:53:06,560 --> 01:53:07,840
And their parents

2275
01:53:10,144 --> 01:53:11,168
Pictures of

2276
01:53:11,680 --> 01:53:13,728
Girls over Saturday

2277
01:53:14,240 --> 01:53:14,752
And they were

2278
01:53:15,264 --> 01:53:19,616
I was like yeah I've been I got home late I'm going to watch TV show my wife

2279
01:53:20,128 --> 01:53:21,152
Come take photos

2280
01:53:26,272 --> 01:53:26,784
Yes

2281
01:53:28,832 --> 01:53:30,624
Like that was

2282
01:53:31,648 --> 01:53:32,416
Reduce this idea

2283
01:53:32,672 --> 01:53:36,768
Like we need to counter the idea that no one likes drop by wearing Trump shirts around

2284
01:53:37,280 --> 01:53:37,792
I meant

2285
01:53:38,304 --> 01:53:41,376
He did sort of introduced the idea of popularity by talking about

2286
01:53:41,632 --> 01:53:45,216
I go to the go to the gym

2287
01:53:49,824 --> 01:53:55,968
Take a pictures of everybody knows me

2288
01:53:56,224 --> 01:53:56,736
Yeah

2289
01:53:56,992 --> 01:53:57,760
It's not like a

2290
01:53:58,016 --> 01:53:59,552
It's not helping the conversation

2291
01:54:00,576 --> 01:54:02,112
Focusing on him

2292
01:54:02,368 --> 01:54:02,880
Which is also

2293
01:54:03,392 --> 01:54:03,904
What he does all the

2294
01:54:04,160 --> 01:54:10,304
Yeah it's very much that drunk conversation that you had with somebody in a bar before where

2295
01:54:12,608 --> 01:54:18,752
For sure that's just like this completely unrelated things exactly change the topic

2296
01:54:19,008 --> 01:54:25,152
Million percent from whatever it was you were talking about

2297
01:54:25,408 --> 01:54:26,688
But yeah

2298
01:54:26,944 --> 01:54:28,480
Call son

2299
01:54:28,736 --> 01:54:30,272
There's one more clip from

2300
01:54:32,832 --> 01:54:33,344
January 8th

2301
01:54:35,392 --> 01:54:35,904
Freaking out

2302
01:54:36,928 --> 01:54:37,696
You know

2303
01:54:37,952 --> 01:54:38,720
They didn't go the way

2304
01:54:40,000 --> 01:54:41,536
Clearly he doesn't have any

2305
01:54:42,048 --> 01:54:43,328
He's expressing

2306
01:54:43,584 --> 01:54:44,864
In this club

2307
01:54:45,120 --> 01:54:45,632
Get out loud

2308
01:54:46,144 --> 01:54:48,448
He's expressing where to go now

2309
01:54:48,960 --> 01:54:52,288
I have just shot my load

2310
01:54:52,544 --> 01:54:53,056
In this

2311
01:54:53,312 --> 01:54:54,848
The earlier show and

2312
01:54:55,104 --> 01:54:56,640
The ramp up to Trump

2313
01:54:57,408 --> 01:54:58,176
And then Trump speech

2314
01:54:58,432 --> 01:54:58,944
Disappoint

2315
01:54:59,200 --> 01:55:00,736
Didn't do what I said it was going

2316
01:55:00,992 --> 01:55:03,040
Everyone's going to know that

2317
01:55:03,552 --> 01:55:04,064
And the only

2318
01:55:05,344 --> 01:55:06,112
Is Rodger Stone

2319
01:55:06,880 --> 01:55:07,392
And so he tells

2320
01:55:08,672 --> 01:55:09,184
Bags

2321
01:55:10,976 --> 01:55:13,792
You told me two years ago band was bad

2322
01:55:14,048 --> 01:55:16,864
I said no so you didn't so I feel guilty

2323
01:55:18,144 --> 01:55:19,168
You said the general

2324
01:55:19,424 --> 01:55:21,728
We're globalist c********** excuse my French

2325
01:55:24,288 --> 01:55:26,592
Who's the new enemy

2326
01:55:27,360 --> 01:55:33,504
Well

2327
01:55:33,760 --> 01:55:36,576
Front right up until the last minute

2328
01:55:36,832 --> 01:55:40,928
Physically out of the building you were the first to say

2329
01:55:41,952 --> 01:55:46,816
Oh I think he is his job

2330
01:55:53,984 --> 01:55:56,544
She doesn't give him an answer at all Alex's begging

2331
01:55:57,056 --> 01:55:58,592
Tell me what hate

2332
01:55:59,104 --> 01:56:01,152
I need you to focus Mia

2333
01:56:01,408 --> 01:56:01,920
In a Direction

2334
01:56:02,176 --> 01:56:03,968
Because this is been a f****** disaster

2335
01:56:04,736 --> 01:56:05,504
And that's kind of

2336
01:56:05,760 --> 01:56:07,296
Implies that Rodgers to blame

2337
01:56:07,552 --> 01:56:12,416
Or Alex

2338
01:56:12,672 --> 01:56:18,304
So you better f****** pick up the pewter hold me he was definitely going to declare a national emergency

2339
01:56:19,072 --> 01:56:24,704
Now I'm going to give you credit for being right about

2340
01:56:24,960 --> 01:56:26,496
Righteous anger at you

To tell me where to go cuz I

2342
01:56:28,800 --> 01:56:30,336
Yeah

2343
01:56:30,592 --> 01:56:31,104
That's that

2344
01:56:31,360 --> 01:56:33,920
That's pretty bad

2345
01:56:34,176 --> 01:56:39,808
That is very much a man

2346
01:56:40,064 --> 01:56:41,600
Immediately recognized

2347
01:56:42,880 --> 01:56:44,672
I'm in over my head and I don't know anything

2348
01:56:51,328 --> 01:56:53,632
I thought he had an inside pipeline

2349
01:56:53,888 --> 01:56:57,216
He doesn't know she doesn't know a goddamn thing

2350
01:56:57,472 --> 01:56:58,240
Earlier in the day

2351
01:56:58,496 --> 01:56:59,264
I didn't have an eclipse

2352
01:56:59,776 --> 01:57:00,544
Episode

2353
01:57:00,800 --> 01:57:02,848
There's an article in zerohedge

2354
01:57:03,104 --> 01:57:03,616
Wasn't

2355
01:57:06,944 --> 01:57:09,248
I like zerohedge but it's

2356
01:57:09,760 --> 01:57:10,272
Yeah

2357
01:57:12,832 --> 01:57:13,856
Other news source

2358
01:57:14,112 --> 01:57:15,392
His world

2359
01:57:15,648 --> 01:57:16,416
Had it right

2360
01:57:16,672 --> 01:57:17,952
He had it wrong

2361
01:57:18,208 --> 01:57:19,232
He's best friends with

2362
01:57:19,744 --> 01:57:20,512
Trump supposed

2363
01:57:21,024 --> 01:57:24,352
Best friend

2364
01:57:27,424 --> 01:57:27,936
The broadcast

2365
01:57:28,960 --> 01:57:29,472
8

2366
01:57:31,008 --> 01:57:31,776
Some more

2367
01:57:32,800 --> 01:57:33,312
Talking about

2368
01:57:35,360 --> 01:57:36,384
He is sleeps at all

2369
01:57:37,152 --> 01:57:37,664
Comes back to work

2370
01:57:38,432 --> 01:57:38,944
On January

2371
01:57:40,480 --> 01:57:40,992
Thursday

2372
01:57:44,064 --> 01:57:44,576
Is how

2373
01:57:46,112 --> 01:57:46,624
He comes to the tail

2374
01:57:47,136 --> 01:57:48,160
And this is super weird

2375
01:57:48,928 --> 01:57:49,696
A couple problems

2376
01:58:00,448 --> 01:58:04,544
Constitutional lawyer really smart cookie founders

2377
01:58:04,800 --> 01:58:06,080
Chubby joining us

2378
01:58:09,408 --> 01:58:12,992
But bottom line

2379
01:58:22,208 --> 01:58:25,280
He is advocating his responsibility

2380
01:58:31,168 --> 01:58:31,680
No he can't

2381
01:58:32,448 --> 01:58:35,776
Crazy declaration

2382
01:58:36,032 --> 01:58:38,336
Trump is no longer president

2383
01:58:38,592 --> 01:58:39,616
She's giving up this

2384
01:58:39,872 --> 01:58:44,736
Power talk about how like he's going to give him some time

2385
01:58:44,992 --> 01:58:46,784
29 days

2386
01:58:47,040 --> 01:58:48,832
That's a strong of languages

2387
01:58:49,600 --> 01:58:50,112
Come out of him

2388
01:58:50,624 --> 01:58:54,208
The front

2389
01:58:58,560 --> 01:59:04,192
Yeah

2390
01:59:04,704 --> 01:59:06,240
Realtor

2391
01:59:06,496 --> 01:59:08,800
I think there is some sort of actual

2392
01:59:09,056 --> 01:59:10,080
Narrative progression

2393
01:59:10,592 --> 01:59:11,616
I've been wrong in the past

2394
01:59:12,128 --> 01:59:13,408
Just walk things back

2395
01:59:13,920 --> 01:59:15,712
I think there is a kernel of

2396
01:59:16,992 --> 01:59:17,504
Resentment

2397
01:59:18,016 --> 01:59:18,528
And disappoint

2398
01:59:19,040 --> 01:59:19,808
Because I think

2399
01:59:21,088 --> 01:59:22,368
When you fly too close to

2400
01:59:22,624 --> 01:59:23,136
To the Sun

2401
01:59:23,648 --> 01:59:24,672
You end up

2402
01:59:25,184 --> 01:59:25,952
Realizing

2403
01:59:26,720 --> 01:59:28,000
What your wings are made of

2404
01:59:28,768 --> 01:59:29,536
That sort of idea

2405
01:59:33,376 --> 01:59:36,192
Flew too close to the Sun Alex has white nationalist wings

2406
01:59:36,448 --> 01:59:37,728
Fed also fascist

2407
01:59:37,984 --> 01:59:39,008
Authoritarian

2408
01:59:40,800 --> 01:59:41,568
Too close to the Sun

2409
01:59:42,080 --> 01:59:42,592
Buy-in

2410
01:59:42,848 --> 01:59:43,360
Encouraging

2411
01:59:43,616 --> 01:59:44,384
And endorse

2412
01:59:46,176 --> 01:59:48,224
The hypothetical in action

2413
01:59:49,248 --> 01:59:49,760
Yeah

2414
01:59:50,016 --> 01:59:50,528
He did that

2415
01:59:50,784 --> 01:59:51,552
Because of the bad info

2416
01:59:52,064 --> 01:59:52,576
Rodger Stone

2417
01:59:54,880 --> 01:59:55,392
Pissed off about

2418
01:59:56,160 --> 01:59:56,672
I think

2419
01:59:57,184 --> 01:59:58,464
On some level he

2420
01:59:58,720 --> 01:59:59,488
He showed ass

2421
02:00:00,256 --> 02:00:01,536
He's got two recliners

2422
02:00:02,304 --> 02:00:03,072
And what does he do

2423
02:00:03,584 --> 02:00:04,608
He starts hanging out with

2424
02:00:04,864 --> 02:00:05,376
F****** oathkeeper

2425
02:00:06,912 --> 02:00:13,056
I haven't heard them a ton on the show I haven't heard the roads of town on the show I don't remember hearing it even in a

2426
02:00:13,312 --> 02:00:14,080
Any of the episodes

2427
02:00:14,592 --> 02:00:17,920
From 2015 that we were listening to

2428
02:00:18,176 --> 02:00:21,248
The only time I know him from Alex Jones is rhetoric

2429
02:00:21,504 --> 02:00:23,808
2009

2430
02:00:24,064 --> 02:00:25,600
Yeah yeah

2431
02:00:27,904 --> 02:00:29,184
During the Tea Party Time

2432
02:00:30,208 --> 02:00:30,976
Proclaim that

2433
02:00:31,232 --> 02:00:32,000
From Glenn Beck

2434
02:00:33,280 --> 02:00:34,048
Yeah

2435
02:00:34,816 --> 02:00:35,328
Tumi

2436
02:00:35,584 --> 02:00:36,608
This is so fast

2437
02:00:37,376 --> 02:00:38,912
Because what do you do

2438
02:00:39,424 --> 02:00:39,936
When

2439
02:00:40,192 --> 02:00:40,960
That all goes bad

2440
02:00:41,472 --> 02:00:42,240
You go back

2441
02:00:43,264 --> 02:00:43,776
Asbestos

2442
02:00:44,032 --> 02:00:44,800
As you can tell

2443
02:00:45,312 --> 02:00:46,336
Similar

2444
02:00:46,592 --> 02:00:47,104
Spiritual verse

2445
02:00:47,360 --> 02:00:47,872
Version of it

2446
02:00:48,128 --> 02:00:48,640
That you had

2447
02:00:49,664 --> 02:00:50,688
It's like going back to an a

2448
02:00:52,480 --> 02:00:52,992
It's it's

2449
02:00:53,248 --> 02:00:55,040
It's like she represents the

2450
02:00:55,552 --> 02:00:56,064
Militant

2451
02:00:57,088 --> 02:00:57,600
Very

2452
02:00:58,368 --> 02:00:59,392
Close to violence

2453
02:01:00,160 --> 02:01:00,672
White

2454
02:01:00,928 --> 02:01:02,976
Supremacist version of Ron Paul's

2455
02:01:03,488 --> 02:01:04,256
Yeah which is

2456
02:01:04,768 --> 02:01:05,536
Closest Alex

2457
02:01:05,792 --> 02:01:06,304
Can get back to

2458
02:01:06,560 --> 02:01:07,328
Home

2459
02:01:07,840 --> 02:01:08,864
And that is what he

2460
02:01:09,120 --> 02:01:10,144
Yearns for

2461
02:01:10,400 --> 02:01:11,424
In the day after this

2462
02:01:11,680 --> 02:01:13,216
Disaster is livestream

2463
02:01:13,472 --> 02:01:16,544
National Emergency

2464
02:01:17,568 --> 02:01:20,896
And then the only way he can really deal with it when it doesn't happen

2465
02:01:21,152 --> 02:01:22,688
Is to blame

2466
02:01:24,736 --> 02:01:25,504
Threatening

2467
02:01:25,760 --> 02:01:27,040
Collapse the economy

2468
02:01:28,064 --> 02:01:29,600
But then also saying like well

2469
02:01:29,856 --> 02:01:30,624
We loved

2470
02:01:30,880 --> 02:01:31,392
Trump

2471
02:01:31,648 --> 02:01:32,416
But he has failed

2472
02:01:33,440 --> 02:01:34,720
That's the only

2473
02:01:35,232 --> 02:01:37,536
That's the only narrative I can see moving forward

2474
02:01:38,560 --> 02:01:40,096
He probably would love to

2475
02:01:40,352 --> 02:01:40,864
To do that

2476
02:01:41,376 --> 02:01:43,168
With his old riding partners

2477
02:01:44,448 --> 02:01:44,960
You f******

2478
02:01:45,728 --> 02:01:47,264
Do you think that

2479
02:01:47,520 --> 02:01:50,848
Kind of signals are getting away from Rodger Stones like

2480
02:01:51,104 --> 02:01:57,248
Palisade

2481
02:01:57,504 --> 02:01:59,296
That failure of Rodger Stone

2482
02:01:59,552 --> 02:02:01,856
Steam pretty big one

2483
02:02:02,112 --> 02:02:05,952
It's babe

2484
02:02:09,280 --> 02:02:10,304
Yeah I think I think

2485
02:02:11,328 --> 02:02:12,352
I hope so I don't know

2486
02:02:12,608 --> 02:02:14,656
I never one who likes to make predictions

2487
02:02:15,168 --> 02:02:16,960
I'm fine with analyzing what's be

2488
02:02:17,216 --> 02:02:18,240
Yeah

2489
02:02:19,264 --> 02:02:21,568
When it comes to that sort of stuff I always feel like

2490
02:02:21,824 --> 02:02:23,616
I think it's going this way and then

2491
02:02:24,128 --> 02:02:25,664
Look on the other

2492
02:02:25,920 --> 02:02:28,992
Far be it for me to say that but it does feel

2493
02:02:29,248 --> 02:02:30,016
Like that

2494
02:02:31,296 --> 02:02:32,320
That feels appropriate

2495
02:02:32,576 --> 02:02:36,160
Alex is trying to get away from

2496
02:02:36,672 --> 02:02:37,952
Whatever Rodger is brought into

2497
02:02:38,208 --> 02:02:38,720
It was life

2498
02:02:39,488 --> 02:02:43,328
I'm going to stop doing this back-channel b******* and I'm going to get back to my roots which is

2499
02:02:44,864 --> 02:02:47,168
White people getting together in murdering

2500
02:02:47,424 --> 02:02:51,776
It was better back then for his business better for all that

2501
02:02:52,032 --> 02:02:55,104
Facebook for that it's true

2502
02:02:55,360 --> 02:02:56,896
I feel like there might be a

2503
02:02:57,408 --> 02:02:57,920
This might be

2504
02:02:58,176 --> 02:03:00,224
Be the signaling of that part of the

2505
02:03:02,528 --> 02:03:08,416
And that we practice

2506
02:03:08,672 --> 02:03:09,440
Acoustic guitar

2507
02:03:13,024 --> 02:03:14,048
Save one more clip

2508
02:03:17,888 --> 02:03:18,656
Can imagine

2509
02:03:18,912 --> 02:03:19,424
More clear

2510
02:03:20,704 --> 02:03:23,776
You're a white person in Germany that's not allowed

2511
02:03:26,336 --> 02:03:27,616
Flipping it now

2512
02:03:38,112 --> 02:03:39,392
That's exactly

2513
02:03:40,160 --> 02:03:41,440
John Waterman

2514
02:03:41,952 --> 02:03:43,488
Talking about on his blog

2515
02:03:43,744 --> 02:03:45,024
From a week ago

2516
02:03:45,280 --> 02:03:45,792
About

2517
02:03:47,328 --> 02:03:48,864
Germany being the second days

2518
02:03:50,144 --> 02:03:51,168
There is no

2519
02:03:51,680 --> 02:03:52,192
Difference

2520
02:03:52,704 --> 02:03:53,472
Between their Reddit

2521
02:03:54,496 --> 02:03:55,264
He's saying that

2522
02:03:55,520 --> 02:03:56,800
White people in Germany

2523
02:03:57,056 --> 02:03:59,872
Are to be extinguished

2524
02:04:00,384 --> 02:04:01,920
Virginia to be gotten rid of

2525
02:04:02,944 --> 02:04:03,456
Nothing

2526
02:04:04,224 --> 02:04:04,736
Nothing

2527
02:04:06,528 --> 02:04:08,064
The people who are more overt

2528
02:04:08,832 --> 02:04:10,112
The different word

2529
02:04:11,136 --> 02:04:11,648
No difference

2530
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:17,536
Information

2531
02:04:17,792 --> 02:04:19,840
Let's f****** fly This Plane home then

2532
02:04:20,608 --> 02:04:22,400
DeLand

2533
02:04:23,424 --> 02:04:24,192
Alex Jones

2534
02:04:24,448 --> 02:04:25,472
Try to do some

2535
02:04:28,544 --> 02:04:29,056
Two-day span

2536
02:04:29,568 --> 02:04:30,336
But what are you trying to

2537
02:04:30,592 --> 02:04:31,360
To do was

2538
02:04:31,616 --> 02:04:32,384
Reveal

2539
02:04:34,688 --> 02:04:35,200
The Apocalypse

2540
02:04:35,968 --> 02:04:37,248
The revolution

2541
02:04:39,296 --> 02:04:40,064
Armageddon

2542
02:04:40,320 --> 02:04:41,856
Japanese war the war

2543
02:04:42,368 --> 02:04:43,392
Literal War

2544
02:04:44,160 --> 02:04:44,672
Direct

2545
02:04:45,184 --> 02:04:46,720
Vengeance filled War

2546
02:04:46,976 --> 02:04:48,256
Between the globalist

2547
02:04:49,024 --> 02:04:49,536
Is nationalist

2548
02:04:49,792 --> 02:04:50,304
Armies

2549
02:04:50,816 --> 02:04:51,328
It was going to

2550
02:04:51,584 --> 02:04:52,096
Beset off

2551
02:04:52,352 --> 02:04:53,120
By Trump

2552
02:04:53,376 --> 02:04:54,656
Coming on are in the Oval Office

2553
02:04:54,912 --> 02:04:55,680
Office

2554
02:04:56,192 --> 02:04:56,704
Pointed out

2555
02:04:57,216 --> 02:04:57,728
Replace

2556
02:04:57,984 --> 02:05:01,568
For war in the place for National Emergency and security

2557
02:05:02,080 --> 02:05:03,360
He was going to come

2558
02:05:04,640 --> 02:05:05,408
I have a backlash

2559
02:05:05,920 --> 02:05:06,944
But the Patriots were right

2560
02:05:09,504 --> 02:05:10,272
Trump's military

2561
02:05:11,040 --> 02:05:13,344
We're going to clear out all the bad people in that

2562
02:05:13,600 --> 02:05:15,392
The Judiciary in the media was going

2563
02:05:15,904 --> 02:05:16,672
Proclaimed all that stuff

2564
02:05:17,440 --> 02:05:19,232
We are not f****** stupid

2565
02:05:19,488 --> 02:05:20,000
So we see

2566
02:05:21,536 --> 02:05:22,048
What do you talk

2567
02:05:24,096 --> 02:05:24,864
Authoritarian power

2568
02:05:25,376 --> 02:05:26,144
Yeah

2569
02:05:26,400 --> 02:05:26,912
Breakside

2570
02:05:27,680 --> 02:05:28,192
He doesn't go his way

2571
02:05:29,472 --> 02:05:30,240
And I think he realizes

2572
02:05:32,800 --> 02:05:33,568
I think he has to

2573
02:05:34,336 --> 02:05:36,384
Because this isn't the same as this year

2574
02:05:37,408 --> 02:05:40,480
It's not the same because in those sober Morning Light

2575
02:05:40,736 --> 02:05:41,248
He is sticking

2576
02:05:41,504 --> 02:05:42,016
Intuit

2577
02:05:42,272 --> 02:05:44,576
Well there's that

2578
02:05:44,832 --> 02:05:48,928
That's the big difference that I'm taking away from that is certainly a different

2579
02:05:49,184 --> 02:05:50,976
Yeah well

2580
02:05:53,280 --> 02:05:56,096
When you play the clip from the next morning and it is

2581
02:05:56,352 --> 02:05:57,632
A continuation

2582
02:05:59,424 --> 02:06:02,752
Escalation of his previous

2583
02:06:03,008 --> 02:06:09,152
Where is drunkenly getting angry and screaming about

2584
02:06:09,408 --> 02:06:10,432
Text morning he's like

2585
02:06:14,272 --> 02:06:16,064
This morning is a

2586
02:06:16,576 --> 02:06:20,672
You know last night I was like I'll give him some time I'll say all of this stuff

2587
02:06:20,928 --> 02:06:21,952
And this morning I'm

2588
02:06:22,464 --> 02:06:24,000
Thinking about it and I continued

2589
02:06:24,256 --> 02:06:24,768
Thinking about it

2590
02:06:25,536 --> 02:06:27,328
And I don't think he's going to

2591
02:06:27,584 --> 02:06:29,632
Come back my way and that way

2592
02:06:29,888 --> 02:06:32,192
Means to me what I can soft from

2593
02:06:32,448 --> 02:06:35,008
That those differences of response

2594
02:06:35,520 --> 02:06:36,288
These events

2595
02:06:36,800 --> 02:06:37,312
Is there

2596
02:06:37,824 --> 02:06:39,872
In the prior event with bombing of Syria

2597
02:06:40,128 --> 02:06:43,200
What got him off that ledge got him back in pocket

2598
02:06:43,456 --> 02:06:44,992
Was the exact advise that

2599
02:06:45,248 --> 02:06:45,760
He no longer

2600
02:06:46,016 --> 02:06:46,784
Exactly

2601
02:06:47,040 --> 02:06:49,088
Back into the

2602
02:06:49,344 --> 02:06:50,368
The fold before

2603
02:06:50,624 --> 02:06:51,392
Is the thing that

2604
02:06:51,648 --> 02:06:52,160
He's like

2605
02:06:52,672 --> 02:06:56,000
That is what got me to say that there was going to be a f****** National

2606
02:06:56,256 --> 02:06:57,024
Yeah I was wrong

2607
02:06:57,536 --> 02:06:58,048
Public

2608
02:06:58,304 --> 02:07:00,096
And that's Rogerstown exactly

2609
02:07:00,352 --> 02:07:01,120
Yeah

2610
02:07:02,912 --> 02:07:05,728
I don't know I don't know what this pretends but I would love it

2611
02:07:06,752 --> 02:07:07,520
Because

2612
02:07:07,776 --> 02:07:08,800
I think there's much more

2613
02:07:09,056 --> 02:07:10,592
Interesting fertile territory

2614
02:07:10,848 --> 02:07:12,128
For Alex outside

2615
02:07:12,640 --> 02:07:14,176
Now yeah

2616
02:07:14,432 --> 02:07:15,200
How much it matters

2617
02:07:16,224 --> 02:07:16,992
Because it's true colors

2618
02:07:17,248 --> 02:07:17,760
Shown

2619
02:07:20,320 --> 02:07:21,088
He want

2620
02:07:21,600 --> 02:07:22,880
Someone like Trump

2621
02:07:23,136 --> 02:07:24,928
And authoritarian white nationalist

2622
02:07:25,184 --> 02:07:26,976
To create a state of emergency

2623
02:07:29,280 --> 02:07:30,816
Unlimited executive

2624
02:07:31,072 --> 02:07:31,840
Power can be

2625
02:07:32,096 --> 02:07:32,864
Express

2626
02:07:33,120 --> 02:07:34,144
In order to get rid of

2627
02:07:35,424 --> 02:07:35,936
Oakley disagree

2628
02:07:36,192 --> 02:07:37,728
He's with in various

2629
02:07:37,984 --> 02:07:40,032
Media judiciary

2630
02:07:40,288 --> 02:07:41,056
Mayor's govern

2631
02:07:41,824 --> 02:07:42,336
That's a wrap

2632
02:07:43,104 --> 02:07:46,432
So I mean it doesn't matter what he pivots to that's in his heart

2633
02:07:46,944 --> 02:07:49,248
Yet you know in the same way that we went back in

2634
02:07:49,504 --> 02:07:50,272
Clip from

2635
02:07:50,528 --> 02:07:53,344
Take the nineties when he's talking about the leaderless resistance

2636
02:07:55,392 --> 02:07:56,672
Louis beam

2637
02:07:57,440 --> 02:07:58,720
You dis is in his heart

2638
02:07:59,488 --> 02:08:00,000
White Nash

2639
02:08:00,256 --> 02:08:00,768
Nationalist

2640
02:08:01,280 --> 02:08:02,304
Ideology

2641
02:08:02,560 --> 02:08:03,584
Always been apart

2642
02:08:03,840 --> 02:08:04,608
Of his rhetoric

2643
02:08:04,864 --> 02:08:05,888
No matter how much is math

2644
02:08:06,656 --> 02:08:08,192
And now we also know

2645
02:08:08,704 --> 02:08:09,216
That

2646
02:08:09,728 --> 02:08:10,752
Strong desire

2647
02:08:11,008 --> 02:08:12,288
For that to be brought in

2648
02:08:12,800 --> 02:08:13,312
Through

2649
02:08:13,568 --> 02:08:14,336
Authoritarianism

2650
02:08:14,848 --> 02:08:15,360
Fascism

2651
02:08:15,872 --> 02:08:16,640
Strong arm tattoo

2652
02:08:17,408 --> 02:08:19,200
That is also probably always

2653
02:08:21,504 --> 02:08:22,528
I don't care what he does

2654
02:08:23,808 --> 02:08:24,320
Although just

2655
02:08:24,576 --> 02:08:25,088
From a

2656
02:08:29,952 --> 02:08:33,536
It wouldn't change my feelings on it but I got to be more interesting to

2657
02:08:33,792 --> 02:08:35,328
To disentangle

2658
02:08:35,584 --> 02:08:36,096
Yeah

2659
02:08:40,960 --> 02:08:41,728
Cuz because

2660
02:08:41,984 --> 02:08:43,264
Of all the stuff we've gone

2661
02:08:44,032 --> 02:08:47,872
So much of that couching of his real authoritarian white Nash

2662
02:08:50,432 --> 02:08:51,200
Similar

2663
02:08:51,712 --> 02:08:53,760
To so many people who are left

2664
02:08:54,016 --> 02:08:54,528
Engaged

2665
02:08:54,784 --> 02:08:55,552
They're talking

2666
02:08:56,320 --> 02:08:57,600
Come from all of these

2667
02:08:59,392 --> 02:09:00,928
These people who are less engaged

2668
02:09:01,696 --> 02:09:02,720
Probably

2669
02:09:03,488 --> 02:09:07,584
Don't have an intellectual understanding of the underpinnings of their

2670
02:09:07,840 --> 02:09:08,608
Talking

2671
02:09:08,864 --> 02:09:09,376
Which are

2672
02:09:09,632 --> 02:09:10,144
Of course right now

2673
02:09:11,168 --> 02:09:13,216
Giving them the benefit of the doubt

2674
02:09:13,472 --> 02:09:15,776
What they're doing is

2675
02:09:17,056 --> 02:09:21,408
You know this is my team that your team I'm going to go with my team no matter what

2676
02:09:22,176 --> 02:09:22,688
And

2677
02:09:22,944 --> 02:09:24,480
It is really important

2678
02:09:25,504 --> 02:09:28,320
It responds to his rhetoric and this is going to come

2679
02:09:28,576 --> 02:09:30,112
From left field for me

2680
02:09:32,160 --> 02:09:33,696
You should talk to the people

2681
02:09:34,720 --> 02:09:35,744
Not engaged

2682
02:09:36,256 --> 02:09:38,048
Who say things like this b*******

2683
02:09:38,304 --> 02:09:39,328
Jordan

2684
02:09:39,584 --> 02:09:40,608
Varian side Jordan

2685
02:09:40,864 --> 02:09:42,656
Because you know my family

2686
02:09:43,680 --> 02:09:49,568
Zoe really and f****** consistently similar to Alex

2687
02:09:50,080 --> 02:09:52,384
And they don't realize that they're white

2688
02:09:53,152 --> 02:09:54,176
Like

2689
02:09:54,688 --> 02:09:56,480
Republican

2690
02:09:57,760 --> 02:10:00,064
It turned into the same thing and they didn't

2691
02:10:00,576 --> 02:10:03,392
They didn't know that it was the same thing

2692
02:10:03,904 --> 02:10:04,416
It's a frog in a

2693
02:10:04,672 --> 02:10:05,184
Kind of

2694
02:10:06,976 --> 02:10:07,488
Raising the temp

2695
02:10:08,512 --> 02:10:09,024
Not realized

2696
02:10:09,536 --> 02:10:10,048
What has

2697
02:10:11,072 --> 02:10:13,376
The thing you felt comfortable

2698
02:10:16,704 --> 02:10:19,776
Conversation

2699
02:10:20,544 --> 02:10:21,312
It's it's

2700
02:10:21,568 --> 02:10:24,896
Got to be something that we have to actually communicate is that

2701
02:10:25,152 --> 02:10:31,296
If you are a disengage Republican you are inexplicably

2702
02:10:31,552 --> 02:10:33,600
A white nationalist and you got to figure out

2703
02:10:34,112 --> 02:10:34,624
How you got the

2704
02:10:35,136 --> 02:10:36,160
Do you have someone like Steve

2705
02:10:36,928 --> 02:10:37,440
Who's in office

2706
02:10:38,976 --> 02:10:39,744
You can't swear that

2707
02:10:40,256 --> 02:10:41,792
With nationalism

2708
02:10:42,048 --> 02:10:42,560
Become a bat

2709
02:10:43,072 --> 02:10:44,864
Damn you can't square that with complace

2710
02:10:45,376 --> 02:10:46,144
There's no way to

2711
02:10:46,912 --> 02:10:47,424
You

2712
02:10:48,704 --> 02:10:49,216
It's not

2713
02:10:49,728 --> 02:10:50,240
It's not okay

2714
02:10:51,520 --> 02:10:52,800
Yeah I think you're right

2715
02:10:53,568 --> 02:10:54,336
Should have those

2716
02:10:55,872 --> 02:10:56,640
It's possible.

2717
02:10:58,944 --> 02:10:59,456
Not appropriate

2718
02:11:00,736 --> 02:11:01,248
Going Pizza

2719
02:11:01,760 --> 02:11:03,040
People up first

2720
02:11:03,296 --> 02:11:04,320
Siding on the wrong side

2721
02:11:04,576 --> 02:11:09,184
Because you might get your ass kicked if you pick the wrong people

2722
02:11:09,440 --> 02:11:10,208
Still conducive

2723
02:11:11,488 --> 02:11:12,000
Conversation too

2724
02:11:14,560 --> 02:11:15,072
Tacitly

2725
02:11:15,584 --> 02:11:16,608
Supporting

2726
02:11:18,400 --> 02:11:18,912
Supporting viola

2727
02:11:19,424 --> 02:11:20,192
Minorities

2728
02:11:20,448 --> 02:11:20,960
People with

2729
02:11:21,216 --> 02:11:21,984
Gender expression

2730
02:11:25,568 --> 02:11:26,336
With medical condition

2731
02:11:26,848 --> 02:11:27,872
Did people look down on

2732
02:11:28,128 --> 02:11:28,640
People

2733
02:11:31,200 --> 02:11:32,224
Lesbian bisexual

2734
02:11:32,480 --> 02:11:34,528
Violence

2735
02:11:38,112 --> 02:11:40,160
Call Dan this was a

2736
02:11:40,416 --> 02:11:41,184
F****** Journey

2737
02:11:41,440 --> 02:11:41,952
It was

2738
02:11:43,744 --> 02:11:44,512
Episode

2739
02:11:45,024 --> 02:11:45,536
Terms of our cover

2740
02:11:45,792 --> 02:11:46,304
Valex Jones

2741
02:11:46,816 --> 02:11:47,328
It's really a

2742
02:11:47,840 --> 02:11:49,376
Illustrative

2743
02:11:52,960 --> 02:11:53,472
To give it again

2744
02:11:53,728 --> 02:11:55,008
Vista

2745
02:11:55,520 --> 02:11:56,032
Strings

2746
02:11:56,288 --> 02:12:01,664
Together but but

2747
02:12:01,920 --> 02:12:02,432
Is pretty clear

2748
02:12:02,688 --> 02:12:03,200
You know I think

2749
02:12:03,456 --> 02:12:04,224
I think what you see

2750
02:12:08,832 --> 02:12:09,344
Not forced

2751
02:12:09,600 --> 02:12:13,696
It's an unforced error it until it is absolutely Alex Jones

2752
02:12:14,720 --> 02:12:15,232
It's embarrassing

2753
02:12:15,744 --> 02:12:17,280
And pretty f***** up but it's also not

2754
02:12:18,048 --> 02:12:18,816
We already knew this stuff

2755
02:12:19,840 --> 02:12:20,352
He's just dumb enough

2756
02:12:23,168 --> 02:12:23,680
Next week

2757
02:12:24,192 --> 02:12:30,336
On Monday but until then we'll be back with probably a lesson

2758
02:12:30,592 --> 02:12:33,408
Not sure about that

2759
02:12:33,664 --> 02:12:39,808
I'll be back though and we will be calm

2760
02:12:40,064 --> 02:12:43,392
Waitering accounts Henry Twitter it's like

2761
02:12:43,648 --> 02:12:46,208
Knowledge underscore authoritarianism is great

2762
02:12:46,464 --> 02:12:52,352
Cam'ron

2763
02:12:54,656 --> 02:12:58,752
We are on iTunes the name of our podcast on iTunes is knowledge fascism

2764
02:12:59,008 --> 02:13:02,080
That's correct guys has been a lot of fun

2765
02:13:03,872 --> 02:13:04,384
God

2766
02:13:06,944 --> 02:13:07,456
We

2767
02:13:07,712 --> 02:13:12,064
Do we have anybody who probably hasn't killed Mike Adams bad Medical

2768
02:13:12,320 --> 02:13:12,832
Advices for

2769
02:13:13,600 --> 02:13:17,952
Blackpilled seems like a real s*** head

2770
02:13:18,208 --> 02:13:21,024
That's true but you just has a bad film criticism

2771
02:13:21,280 --> 02:13:22,816
Bad ideas about race

2772
02:13:24,864 --> 02:13:26,912
Technically

2773
02:13:27,936 --> 02:13:28,448
That guy's Alex

2774
02:13:33,312 --> 02:13:36,896
Alexandra Thurston color
