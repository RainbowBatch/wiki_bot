7
00:00:38,656 --> 00:00:44,800
Like twice

8
00:00:50,688 --> 00:00:51,456
No

9
00:00:52,736 --> 00:00:58,880
The Shack song no hooks featuring The

Start my disagree

12
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:08,352
Rated

13
00:01:08,608 --> 00:01:10,656
Very competent as a rapper

14
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:16,032
I think the people need to remember that there is a joke

15
00:01:16,288 --> 00:01:17,824
No it wasn't all right

16
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,872
Platinum has a song with biggie

17
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:26,784
Dazn on a track with Method Man and the Rizzo

00:01:32,928 --> 00:01:34,976
Wichita

19
00:01:35,232 --> 00:01:41,376
I've known him for a long time I have to live with this

20
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:47,776
Alex Jones put out on 2018

21
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:54,176
I don't know it sucks to be in the present

22
00:01:54,432 --> 00:02:00,576
Cancel this and then wait for you to do another 30 hours of research we can just

23
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:04,160
Play the entire 40 minutes

24
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:07,488
Debate that I found between Lee and McAdoo

25
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:09,536
And Owen Shroyer know

26
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:11,072
Other side of the debate

27
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:12,096
Eddie Bravo

28
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:18,496
All right well now I'm debating Flat Earth

29
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:25,920
It's not about the shooting it's very weird

30
00:02:26,176 --> 00:02:28,736
The Earth is flat

31
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:35,136
Very f*****-up

32
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:36,672
As I got the light

33
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:44,864
Santa Fe Texas shooting

34
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:49,728
Second Amendment people would allow me to give thoughts and prayers to Ted Cruz's

35
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,288
You know what those look

36
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:54,848
That's horrible

37
00:02:55,104 --> 00:02:57,408
I'm fine with it

38
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,200
Define

39
00:02:59,456 --> 00:03:04,064
Sacrificed a separate myself from that sentiment

40
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:09,440
You say that if you live in other than what the president said I understand

41
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:10,976
But that doesn't mean that it's okay for us

42
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:12,256
Just because it's open

43
00:03:12,512 --> 00:03:14,560
Portable heated but anyway

44
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:15,328
Did Elisabeth

45
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:19,168
I watched the press conference that they advertised

46
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:20,448
The other day

47
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:24,800
Fire went out to the memorial of the shooting

48
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:26,848
The night of they were having a vigil

49
00:03:27,104 --> 00:03:29,920
Type thing and like Ted Cruz showed up and

50
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:33,504
Governor Abbott Texas governor showed up

51
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:38,624
And I'm just thinking wouldn't it be better if you

52
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:42,464
I would think that the best thing that could happen to me is for me to just

53
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:45,536
Go away

54
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:46,304
2 oz

55
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:51,936
Preferable

56
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:53,216
Horrible

57
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:53,984
Horrible

58
00:03:55,776 --> 00:04:01,920
Should I watch that

59
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:04,224
Actually all that terrible

60
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,504
Like

61
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:08,832
Antagonizing people really

62
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:10,880
There were a number of

63
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:15,744
Some of the interviews he did were really messed up but it was just at the people he was talking

64
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:17,536
You're stupid

65
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:21,887
He ran into a couple people who were like you know this is all about

66
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:29,055
You weren't being

67
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:31,103
Disrespectful to the proceedings

68
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:32,895
And so like I'm not saying

69
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:38,015
I tip my cap to your reporting or anything like that it's not really all that interesting

70
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:40,319
I think it's really negative in the sense that it's

71
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:41,343
Kind of normalizing

72
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:45,439
Because if they did go out to this thing and everyone was fine with them being there

73
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:46,207
For the most part

74
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:49,279
And they just behaved like a normal news organization

75
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:55,679
It kind of gives them cover in some ways to be like this reporting at that scares me a little bit

76
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:57,471
I think what we should have learned

77
00:04:57,727 --> 00:04:58,495
From the Grinch

78
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:02,591
Not to gather hands

79
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:07,455
But to grab pitchforks and torches and murder the Grinch

80
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:09,247
The real lesson

81
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:11,551
Broccoli

82
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:21,791
But look so we're covering that and out really pretty

83
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:24,095
Particularly care cuz every time we have one of these shootings

84
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:26,655
You know dude story is

85
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:27,423
Misogyny

86
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:30,239
The story is angry white men

87
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:36,127
Feel like they're entitled stories come out about one of the victims of the shooting

88
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:39,967
Rejected his advances

89
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:40,735
Domestic

90
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:47,135
Another story came out just the other day about the Sutherland Springs shooting with a guy went to the church kill 20-something people and

91
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:51,999
The story that just came out about how she'd waterboarded his wife in the past

92
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:57,375
And over and over again in any conversation that does not taking that into account

93
00:05:57,631 --> 00:06:00,447
Is really conversation worth having

94
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:02,751
Okay let's table gun control

95
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:03,775
Alright

96
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:07,871
And instead let's just put every single f****** white man in jail

97
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:14,271
I will stay there in jail

98
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:17,087
Because I'm f****** done

99
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:19,135
Look

100
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:21,183
Mass shooting

101
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:23,743
Names of the last couple years and I did a article on

102
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:25,791
Or website you can find

103
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:28,607
That's register almost everything

104
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:32,703
The conclusion that I came to and I believe this

105
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:33,471
This is like

106
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:34,751
You going to have to

107
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:36,287
Choose one problem to solve

108
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:38,847
It's either got to be the guns or the dudes

109
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:42,687
I don't think Alex wants to talk about either of them than most people

110
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:48,063
Who are in positions of power don't really want to talk about either

111
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:50,367
What you're talking about

112
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:56,767
Like the idea of adding more doors to a school or taking away drawers

113
00:06:57,023 --> 00:06:58,559
That's what I'm saying all this stuff is like

114
00:06:59,071 --> 00:07:00,863
Each each successive

115
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:02,143
Shooting that happened

116
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:04,447
Be like the answer gif

117
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:05,471
Weaker

118
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:09,311
Like you know last time it was we need to arm teachers

119
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:11,871
Free week what are you what are you talkin to hold on

120
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:14,687
Pretty

121
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:18,527
And people did not enjoy that idea

122
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:23,391
So time goes on we have another school shooting and they know they can't just toss that back into the ring

123
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:24,671
This time it's

124
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:25,695
Let's doors

125
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:28,511
Even weaker than arming teachers

126
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:29,791
That's stupid

127
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:33,887
You know that's going to cause a bottleneck of people trying to get out of the school

128
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:36,447
Lendup

129
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:41,567
Do you understand what your next time it's going to be

130
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:47,711
Even weaker f****** argument in order to not talk about the gun issue or the male entitlement issue one of it

131
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:48,991
There is no

132
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:51,295
It doesn't matter how weak there are

133
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:53,599
Is because the argument that they're always make

134
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:57,439
We will watch your children die

135
00:07:57,695 --> 00:07:58,463
That's the argument

136
00:07:58,719 --> 00:08:00,255
We don't f****** care

137
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:01,791
I want

138
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:08,447
Look at the statistics and everybody's put out has more children have died in full

139
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:09,983
Shootings Bend service

140
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:11,775
This year

141
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:15,615
That is absolutely accurate because what it really is is

142
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:20,991
In the war against the rest of us

143
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:27,391
We haven't been part of that war we've just been the f****** Victor

144
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:32,255
These people need to go

145
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:33,279
.

146
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:37,375
I can't say

147
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:38,655
I want

148
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:45,055
To give people my thoughts and prayers Dan

149
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:47,871
The thing

150
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:48,639
Instead I'm thinking

151
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:55,039
Because there's no other way we have to if this is a civil war Scituate

152
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:58,623
Civil War

153
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:05,023
Behind the scenes Civil War get election behind the curtain of Illusion

154
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:11,167
Unfortunately but we can't lump ourselves into that group

155
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:12,191
We're not in school

156
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:15,263
You never anything like that we are just

157
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:17,567
We rise external to it as

158
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:19,359
You're not a lot of people it's just

159
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:20,383
We respect

160
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:21,151
The Voice

161
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:22,687
People who are part of it

162
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:28,319
Anyway I know about that now 10 minutes later

163
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:30,111
How do you f******

164
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:36,511
How do you avoid having the only accurate

165
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:45,215
Murder.

In a post-apocalyptic nuclear Wasteland in America people have more hope than that f****** girl

168
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:53,151

Comforting for everybody to hear maybe can't change our can't change our listeners opinion of Alex

171
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:13,375
Going to be talking about around the internet

172
00:10:13,631 --> 00:10:16,447
We're out at the they went to the Google Fiber store

173
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:23,103
Afterwards

Accidentally

175
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:30,271
Showed up because he was watching the livestream it was like I can go find them

176
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:33,343

177
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:34,879
Help him launch

Spider-Man on 6th Street

180
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:51,263
As soon as he recognizes it is one of his listeners who's crazy

181
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:53,823
He immediately slams his drink

182
00:10:57,407 --> 00:10:59,455
Hey brother I got to go

183
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:05,855
He just tries to get away from him as quick as possible it's really funny but there's no way for us to really cover that

184
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:07,391
Yeah well he's

185
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:10,463
He's aware of danger

186
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:17,887
Alex's own ideas to start

187
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:22,239
The listener he did not recognize this

188
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:25,823
Scooby-Doo or whatever the f****** guy's name was his name

189
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:28,383
Goddamnit Sylvester

190
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:30,175
Daffy Duck it was Daffy Duck

191
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:31,199
That was it

192
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:36,063
Tails nicely into this article out of the Guardian

193
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:37,343
That also came out

194
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:43,743
The reason we're not going to cover that is good at the video and it's really not fun just as audio and it's too difficult for us to play

195
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:45,535
Play a video that you have to watch

196
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:50,143
We all have a text documentary

197
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:54,495
The guardian

198
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:55,775
How to find the

199
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:56,543
The date on

200
00:11:57,567 --> 00:12:03,711
This is from Saturday shooter was conspiracy theory

201
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:04,479
First what do we

202
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:05,247
Reno

203
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:09,343
So turns out that bunch of documents got released

204
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:10,111
About

205
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:15,743
About Stephen Paddock the guy who shot up the concert country concert in LA

206
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:17,023
Las Vegas

207
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:21,887
And that they're bunch of people who had run into him

208
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:24,447
And bunch of people I gave statements

209
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:27,263
There was this one

210
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:34,943
Lady days before the shooting at with her son

211
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:39,295
She said she heard him and continue discussing the 25th anniversary of Ruby Ridge

212
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:40,319
And the Waco Siege

213
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:47,231
She said she heard him and His companion saying the courtroom Flags they got a courtroom with me

214
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:48,511
The beliefs of gold frame

215
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:51,839
Jurisdiction or admiralty Flags

216
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:54,399
Is characteristic of the so-called Sovereign citizen

217
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:56,447
Believer

218
00:12:56,703 --> 00:12:58,751
The current u.s. government and its laws are illegitimate

219
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:02,847
A bunch of other stuff they found about him being afraid of FEMA camps

220
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:05,663
And stuff like that and what it really goes to show I think

221
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:06,943
Is important is that

222
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:08,223
This guy who

223
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:09,759
Bum-rushed Alex

224
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:13,087
At that far away from him

225
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:19,743
I hate people who believe the same stuff I believe but aren't millionaires are crazy

226
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:24,351
I have to get away from that information coming out

227
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:25,375
About Patek

228
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:26,399
And we see

229
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:29,215
Oh he believes a lot of the same stuff Alex does

230
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:32,031
Which is why he has to spend the narratives about him being a lefty

231
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:34,079
Big antifa being God

232
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:43,039
So if you're going to if you're going to get caught in the conspiracy web you try and put it towards the guy who's there

233
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:44,831
In the

234
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:45,855
The left

235
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:47,135
Right right

236
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:52,511
Audio segments

237
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:57,631
I talked about not this episode for the first 13 14 minutes of the episode

238
00:13:57,887 --> 00:14:01,983
This is Special Report on Saturday cuz

239
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:03,519
What happened

240
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:04,799
Amboy

241
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:06,591
Alex is really worried

242
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:07,615
And he should be

243
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:09,919
No I did see this one

244
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:13,503
Gorgeous

245
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:16,831
Oh yeah so years that out of context drops

246
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:18,367
From today's episode

247
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:20,159
Special Report

248
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:20,927
May

249
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:25,535
Is this

250
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:29,119
It is pretty crazy Rogers.

251
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:30,143
It's not crazy

252
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:31,679
As much as

253
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:38,079
We have been saying this for a long time that Rodger Stone was going to go down.

254
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:44,479
This is news

255
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:50,367
Sounds good as Alex

256
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:53,183
A reasonably good chance

257
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:57,023
What's

258
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:06,751
Come at me

259
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:11,871
Stone Stones age

260
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:14,175
Have been called Africa

261
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:16,223
Social media

262
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:20,063
I have been brought in to Mueller in the investigation

263
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:22,623
That's what Alex has really freaked out about because

264
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:23,903
Fit this is the right

265
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:26,463
Thread to pull if you're investigating us

266
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:27,999
Does the Social Media stuff

267
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:30,559
Is really where you know you get

268
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:33,631
You get to figure out exactly where was intention

269
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:38,751
You know like what was an accident in terms of box elevator your traffic and what was intentional

270
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:42,847
Is really important to nail down if you're trying

271
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:44,895
The track the actual

272
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:47,455
Story

273
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:49,759
Colleges on Russia's payroll

274
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:54,111
Before we go

275
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:59,231
I was looking into Rodger Stone a little bit just for fun I read an article

276
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:01,023
About him from The New Yorker

277
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:04,351
Also that must have been the shortest FBI

278
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:10,239
Could you say on tape that you are a Rodger

279
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:11,775
Mediaite

280
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:16,383
No you have to say

281
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:17,407
Oh yeah he did it

282
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:23,807
Whatever it is you're going to ask

283
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:30,207
So I read this article about Rodger Stone from The New Yorker in 2000

284
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:37,375
Vaguely Swingers Bars brings his own bottles of vodka

285
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:42,751
Good time but he hears a couple passages that I found particularly interest

286
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:49,919
Over the years relationship with colleagues and clients have been so combustible as a messenger has been copper

287
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:56,575
Stone work for Donald Trump as an occasional lobbyist in advisor when Trump considered running for president in 2000

288
00:16:56,831 --> 00:17:02,975
Quote Rodger is a stone-cold loser Trump told me credit for things he never did

289
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:07,583
That's good

290
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:15,775
Call Ed Rollins who served as President Reagan first political director said quote Rodger was a fringe player around town

291
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:19,615
It was a reputation of being a guy who exaggerated things

292
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:23,199
Rodger was never on Nixon staff was never on the White House staff

293
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:27,807
I don't think you'll find anyone in the business who trust him Rodger always has been a little rat

294
00:17:29,343 --> 00:17:35,487
So that's that's why I believe he's in the center of things more

295
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:41,887
It doesn't matter

296
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:48,287
Nixon Administration to tell me the truth about anybody about Rodger Stone from Buffalo

297
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:51,359
He got involved

298
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:54,943
What people thought about it before all this

299
00:17:56,223 --> 00:17:59,807
I just like the idea that somebody in the Nixon Administration is like

300
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:02,367
That guy is not credible

301
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:03,391
Thanks Google

302
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:10,559
Emergency Special Report on

303
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:14,143
Saturday cuz he's got a call from Rodger saying

304
00:18:15,167 --> 00:18:16,191
Start

305
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:18,239
Try to promote Americana

306
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:20,287
25 years ago

307
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:22,591
That album by

308
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:27,711
America

309
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:29,247
Give me the capital of

310
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:32,063
Get rid of

311
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:33,855
The First Amendment

312
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:35,647
I thought well I'll get

313
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:40,767
25 years later

314
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:45,631
I look back and

315
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:49,727
The effect we've had it America

316
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:50,495
The world

317
00:18:50,751 --> 00:18:51,263
Chet Baker

318
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:52,031
Nationalism

319
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:53,311
So shouldn't be

320
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:55,103
Capitalism

321
00:18:55,615 --> 00:18:56,639
Americana

322
00:18:56,895 --> 00:19:00,223
Your name is probably in an utterly disappointed

323
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:04,575
I am one of the most prominent people in the world

324
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:07,391
Doing this

325
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:09,951
And women

326
00:19:11,231 --> 00:19:12,255
Who are super smart

327
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:14,047
Very Charming

328
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:15,839
Very hard-working

329
00:19:16,863 --> 00:19:17,887
Chosen

330
00:19:19,423 --> 00:19:22,495
To go along with the establishment because

331
00:19:24,543 --> 00:19:27,103
So the things I'm going to say to hear the breaking news you're going to see

332
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:28,127
Saturday

333
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:29,407
19th of May

334
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:30,687
2000 +

335
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:32,479
Vital

336
00:19:32,991 --> 00:19:34,015
My sister's getting married

337
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:37,343
That's a breaking news

338
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:38,623
Because this is so important

339
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:43,743
Farley's

340
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:49,887
Weather alerts

341
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:54,495
He doesn't break that up Alex

342
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:56,799
You're going to miss that weather

343
00:19:57,055 --> 00:19:58,079
Just left the report

344
00:19:58,847 --> 00:20:04,991
You weren't invited that wedding where you at the end of it spoiler alert shows up just wandering around the studios like

345
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:08,831
Miles for a little while

346
00:20:09,087 --> 00:20:09,599
Your Africa

347
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:15,999

I got the Special Report is over an hour long so if she's getting married in an hour

00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:25,471
She's getting married at Infowars Studios

350
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:31,615
Possibly like two drinks

351
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:33,151
South

352
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:37,503
You know that's just a nice standard Preamble for Alex

353
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:40,063
You've got you know globalist on the mind

354
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:41,343
What have you been

355
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:44,415
Busy so you know it's important that he's doing this

356
00:20:45,695 --> 00:20:46,207
Are you mad

357
00:20:46,463 --> 00:20:47,999
But he also has received

358
00:20:49,535 --> 00:20:52,351
Now I got a message for Robert Mueller

359
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:54,655
I got a message for Hillary Clinton

360
00:20:55,423 --> 00:20:57,215

00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:02,591
Crowley ice

364

Egos running outfit

365
00:21:11,807 --> 00:21:14,111
Long pauses in the bathtub

366
00:21:15,647 --> 00:21:17,952
I thought I was going to talk a big news on the breakdown

367
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:22,816
You're not

368
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:26,656
The mainstream media was going to push this to me about it

369
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,520

Start with the

403
00:23:35,936 --> 00:23:38,496
If you're 14 and you're watching Friday After Next

404
00:23:38,752 --> 00:23:43,104
No leave it no movie series is transformed themselves

405
00:23:43,616 --> 00:23:45,920
More than the Friday.

406
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:49,248
Serious with some Goofy's out of comedic relief

407
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:56,928
Very much absurd comedy

408
00:23:57,184 --> 00:24:03,072
I think Friday is an amazing movie

409
00:24:03,328 --> 00:24:07,680
A long time but you also

410
00:24:08,192 --> 00:24:08,704

That's how we got caught off

416
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:32,256
True true

417
00:24:33,536 --> 00:24:37,888
It's an interesting thing I think Alex is actually really worried cuz it keeps saying he's not worried

418
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:39,168
And he's very restrained

419
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:45,056
Like if you're not going to see much freaked out from Alex you just going to

420
00:24:45,312 --> 00:24:47,360
Which you're going to see it attempted really liar

421
00:24:47,616 --> 00:24:48,896
Okay

422
00:24:49,152 --> 00:24:54,528
If it's you trying to be very serious and actually he's acting like he's bringing forth real information

423
00:24:56,064 --> 00:24:57,088
No it's not

424
00:24:57,344 --> 00:24:59,648
Baby as far as him drunkenly screaming feel your hand

425
00:24:59,904 --> 00:25:00,928
Or something like that but

426
00:25:01,184 --> 00:25:01,696
There's a lot

427
00:25:01,952 --> 00:25:03,744
You can dig into I think you're going to try to find some

428
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:04,512
Real bulshit

429
00:25:05,024 --> 00:25:05,792
Restart

00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:07,584

What was Mueller asked

449
00:26:07,744 --> 00:26:08,768
Of the five we talked

00:26:09,024 --> 00:26:09,792
One won't talk

451
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,328
Good call

452
00:26:11,584 --> 00:26:14,912

00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,200
Wait till you hear her

457
00:26:27,456 --> 00:26:28,480
Play me the Russian Mastermind

458
00:26:28,736 --> 00:26:29,760
There's more

459
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:38,464
Wamego at Soros Alex

460
00:26:39,232 --> 00:26:43,840
That's the strawman

461
00:26:44,096 --> 00:26:44,864
Even the most

462
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:47,168
Paranoid person is still like

463
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:54,336
Two-bit player come on man spent hundreds of hours going over his rizin 20

15 into the Trump campaign

465
00:26:57,152 --> 00:26:58,176
Like we never thought

466
00:26:58,688 --> 00:27:01,760
Smart know we always thought

467
00:27:02,016 --> 00:27:07,136
The obvious thing is he's being f***** with by people over and over again it Rodger stone is

468
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:07,904
F*** with him

469
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:10,208
Like 2nd degree

470
00:27:10,464 --> 00:27:10,976
Delightful

471
00:27:11,232 --> 00:27:14,304
He also is running a scam operation that

472
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:18,400
Is easily manipulated

473
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:25,824
Pendragon type situation with Rodger Stone in jail

474
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,016
The better part of three decades

475
00:27:34,272 --> 00:27:40,416
If there is a secret space program

476
00:27:42,976 --> 00:27:44,768
But that would make more sense than most

477
00:27:45,536 --> 00:27:46,816
This is big news

478
00:27:47,072 --> 00:27:48,352
Big news coming out of the Trump

Other exhibits

483
00:27:56,032 --> 00:27:57,312
We broke this last Sunday Rodger

484
00:27:59,104 --> 00:28:00,384

485
00:28:01,408 --> 00:28:06,528

Cambridge Professor Stefan

488
00:28:11,392 --> 00:28:11,904
Helper

489
00:28:12,928 --> 00:28:19,072
Is a zerohedge hadlyme you claiming that it's like mainstream news and

490
00:28:19,328 --> 00:28:20,352
New York Times

491
00:28:22,144 --> 00:28:25,216
The other headlines are about it that I found our

492
00:28:25,472 --> 00:28:31,616
Trump says

493
00:28:31,872 --> 00:28:32,384
Don't

494
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:37,248
Doesn't the FBI and the CIA have planted most white nationalist organizations yeah

495
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,808
Hey baby that's just a reasonable thing to do

496
00:28:40,064 --> 00:28:41,088
I'll tell you what

497
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:45,952
If you want to like say that our government had infiltrated Trump's campaign

498
00:28:46,208 --> 00:28:48,768
That opens the door wide open for

499
00:28:49,024 --> 00:28:53,888
Who else was in there infiltrating about that out

500
00:28:56,704 --> 00:28:57,216
Have another exam

501
00:28:59,008 --> 00:28:59,520
Sure

502
00:29:01,056 --> 00:29:02,848
Cuz I'm like I'm not going to just sit around

503
00:29:03,104 --> 00:29:03,616
Tell you what

504
00:29:04,384 --> 00:29:06,432
Show you what

505
00:29:06,944 --> 00:29:08,736
Okay

506
00:29:08,992 --> 00:29:13,088
Another headline here real quick

507
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:17,952
Bruce Edward Ivan

508
00:29:20,256 --> 00:29:22,048
Comey & Mueller hope you forget

509
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:24,352
And Sean P O'Neill

510
00:29:26,144 --> 00:29:31,520
We're going to get into this until a little bit later I know is that his name is probably don't ring a bell necessarily

511
00:29:31,776 --> 00:29:34,848
I will get into it as Alex gets into it surgically decipher right

512
00:29:36,128 --> 00:29:37,664
And then Michael R Caputo

513
00:29:43,808 --> 00:29:45,856
Robert Mueller is an amoral legal

514
00:29:47,648 --> 00:29:48,416
Will do his job

515
00:29:50,464 --> 00:29:56,608
That's a headline from the Lyndon larouche political action committee not going to take that one all that seriously

516
00:29:57,888 --> 00:30:04,032
The the Lyndon larouche political action committee

517
00:30:04,288 --> 00:30:04,800
I don't

518
00:30:05,056 --> 00:30:07,360
We don't have time we'll get it to another day

519
00:30:08,128 --> 00:30:08,640
Piece of s***

520
00:30:11,456 --> 00:30:12,480
That's just some of the research

521
00:30:13,504 --> 00:30:14,016
Call

522
00:30:14,784 --> 00:30:15,808
Hit midnight last night

523
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:18,368
Three headlines with some of the research he did

524
00:30:19,392 --> 00:30:20,416
Rodger Stone

525
00:30:22,464 --> 00:30:24,256
Give you directions to go off in

526
00:30:24,768 --> 00:30:27,072
So whatever is being

527
00:30:27,328 --> 00:30:31,680
Just being filtered through Rodger to Alec

528
00:30:32,192 --> 00:30:36,288
So it's already third-hand information even if any of it is real

529
00:30:36,544 --> 00:30:39,104
But then the research that he did

530
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:45,504
McClatchy article which will get back into the past

531
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:46,784
Does Alex gets into it

532
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:50,880
An article from zerohedge

533
00:30:51,392 --> 00:30:52,416
Political action committee

534
00:30:52,672 --> 00:30:55,488
This is not good research this is this is Shawty

535
00:30:58,048 --> 00:30:58,816
They're not either

536
00:30:59,072 --> 00:31:00,352
Headlines that sound

537
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:02,656
Like maybe they built to something

538
00:31:02,912 --> 00:31:04,704
Straw

539
00:31:05,216 --> 00:31:06,240
How do I

540
00:31:07,264 --> 00:31:08,544
Most of the Special Report

541
00:31:09,056 --> 00:31:10,080
Is really Alex Black

542
00:31:10,592 --> 00:31:12,128
He's really just trying to be like

543
00:31:13,152 --> 00:31:18,016
Punk he should talk to me a little bit

544
00:31:19,296 --> 00:31:20,576
So I'm going to lay this out right now

545
00:31:21,856 --> 00:31:23,648
For the average solace

546
00:31:23,904 --> 00:31:24,672
Corporate climber

547
00:31:25,952 --> 00:31:28,256
Having Robert Mueller breathing down your neck

548
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:29,536
Would be a really scary

549
00:31:31,072 --> 00:31:34,144
Can you find out how you

550
00:31:34,656 --> 00:31:35,424
You'll bend over

551
00:31:37,984 --> 00:31:38,752
Chatting with you

552
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:42,592
Chords

553
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:43,872
Chords the timer

554
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:45,920
Because it's emission I chose

555
00:31:46,176 --> 00:31:47,200
You're going to do the spikes

556
00:31:49,248 --> 00:31:50,016
Self-preservation

557
00:31:50,272 --> 00:31:50,784
Fight people

558
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,576
America is about men

559
00:31:53,088 --> 00:31:54,368
I smell anachronism

560
00:31:54,624 --> 00:31:55,392
Was about men

561
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:56,672
Fighting

562
00:31:56,928 --> 00:31:57,696
Strongman

563
00:31:57,952 --> 00:31:58,464
Congrats

564
00:32:00,768 --> 00:32:01,280
I know it's

565
00:32:02,816 --> 00:32:05,632
Do you know what

566
00:32:05,888 --> 00:32:07,424
Cuz my soul

567
00:32:07,936 --> 00:32:09,472
My spirit my gut feels aligned

568
00:32:11,008 --> 00:32:11,520
The only master

569
00:32:12,288 --> 00:32:14,336
God your God. Dockside.

570
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:16,640
Fake hypocrite herb ivory

571
00:32:17,152 --> 00:32:18,176
No you are

572
00:32:18,688 --> 00:32:19,456
I just I got my own

573
00:32:19,712 --> 00:32:20,224
Personal relationship

574
00:32:21,248 --> 00:32:21,760
My rock

575
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:24,832
Republic Service

576
00:32:25,856 --> 00:32:26,624
Sounds unhealthy

577
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,160
That's an unhealthy relationship

578
00:32:28,416 --> 00:32:33,024
Relationship

579
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:34,816
And we need to get him away from you

580
00:32:35,072 --> 00:32:37,120
Yeah like Jesus has someone that Alex

581
00:32:37,376 --> 00:32:42,496
We talkin about it being a relationship

582
00:32:43,264 --> 00:32:46,336
Like I I don't want to put too fine a point on this but like

583
00:32:47,104 --> 00:32:50,688
If Alex has a personal other people

584
00:32:50,944 --> 00:32:52,480
Spirituality or anything

585
00:32:52,992 --> 00:32:58,880
Define then I'll do a little bit of it if Alex has a personal relationship with his conception of God

586
00:32:59,136 --> 00:33:02,464
And God is fine with him getting drunk and screaming at women on the street

587
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:03,232
For example

588
00:33:05,792 --> 00:33:06,304
All the time

589
00:33:07,072 --> 00:33:09,888
He's fine with any of the other thing

590
00:33:10,912 --> 00:33:11,936
Documented over the last

591
00:33:12,192 --> 00:33:12,704
Year-and-a-half

592
00:33:13,728 --> 00:33:14,496
That God does

593
00:33:15,008 --> 00:33:17,056
That is not that is not a god

594
00:33:17,568 --> 00:33:18,848
In the vein of any

595
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:25,504
Except for baby just hard Old Testament but even then the Commandments are very specific

596
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,552
Hard

597
00:33:27,808 --> 00:33:33,952
They are breaking them if I recall correctly

598
00:33:42,144 --> 00:33:44,448
It's f****** guy I was allowed me

599
00:33:44,704 --> 00:33:45,728
To be a white match

600
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,264
425

601
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:50,592
He allowed me to drink on air

602
00:33:50,848 --> 00:33:51,360
He

603
00:33:51,616 --> 00:33:52,128
Pushed

604
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,152
Frankly

605
00:33:53,408 --> 00:33:53,920
Pushed me

606
00:33:54,176 --> 00:33:56,992
To be mean and cruel to people

607
00:33:57,248 --> 00:34:00,576
Talking about is Jesus Christ

608
00:34:01,088 --> 00:34:03,904
I'm not afraid of Mueller but he is afraid of God

609
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:05,696
Right is another person is not afraid of

610
00:34:08,256 --> 00:34:08,768
My message

611
00:34:09,024 --> 00:34:09,536
Mueller

612
00:34:14,912 --> 00:34:15,424
John McCain

613
00:34:20,032 --> 00:34:24,384
I don't like that Alex is like he calls them walking brain tumors cuz like

614
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:26,176
Look whatever whatever

615
00:34:26,432 --> 00:34:28,992
You say about John McCain and not liking him yet

616
00:34:29,248 --> 00:34:29,760
Point taken

617
00:34:30,016 --> 00:34:30,528
I agree with

618
00:34:30,784 --> 00:34:32,320
I think it's a really f******

619
00:34:33,088 --> 00:34:36,672
Fuckedupshit anything to make fun of him having a brain tumor

620
00:34:37,696 --> 00:34:42,304
I'm sure you are I'm not I don't I don't like that and we are duty calls

621
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:43,584
Hillary

622
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:46,656
And I are walking

623
00:34:46,912 --> 00:34:47,424
It's a cheap

624
00:34:47,936 --> 00:34:48,448
The chi

625
00:34:48,704 --> 00:34:49,728
F****** ugly attack

626
00:34:51,264 --> 00:34:51,776
Yeah

627
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:53,312
Okay

628
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:59,456
Recite

629
00:34:59,712 --> 00:35:00,224
Book them

630
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:01,248
I don't give a s***

631
00:35:02,272 --> 00:35:04,320
I don't look

632
00:35:07,392 --> 00:35:07,904
The real power

633
00:35:09,696 --> 00:35:10,208
Let me

634
00:35:11,744 --> 00:35:12,256
Try to walk

635
00:35:12,512 --> 00:35:13,024
Through this

636
00:35:15,584 --> 00:35:19,680
Another. That's what Star Wars.

637
00:35:20,192 --> 00:35:23,264
New Age Star Wars

638
00:35:23,776 --> 00:35:25,568
Sorry I don't want to I don't want to discuss

639
00:35:25,824 --> 00:35:26,336
Any more of your

640
00:35:26,592 --> 00:35:32,480
Like I'm not your ideas but like I don't want to talk about it's okay to make fun of someone having a brain tumor

641
00:35:32,736 --> 00:35:33,760
Doesn't make that fine for me

642
00:35:34,272 --> 00:35:40,416
Your position is your position mine is mine good enough

643
00:35:40,672 --> 00:35:41,440
A person to share it

644
00:35:41,952 --> 00:35:43,488
But

645
00:35:45,536 --> 00:35:46,816
I'm not

646
00:35:47,072 --> 00:35:53,216
Philosophy philosophy is

647
00:35:53,472 --> 00:35:58,336
Million so go f*** yourself I hope

648
00:35:58,592 --> 00:35:59,104
I hope

649
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:05,504
I hope John McCain's brain tumor gets a brain tumor that kills his brain tumor as the brain tumor kill

650
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:08,320
I don't give a fuk

651
00:36:09,088 --> 00:36:11,136
I honestly I don't

652
00:36:11,392 --> 00:36:14,464
I agree I agree with you in terms of like

653
00:36:14,976 --> 00:36:17,024
There are a lot of really awful people

654
00:36:17,536 --> 00:36:19,072
Often masquerading as Beason

655
00:36:19,328 --> 00:36:19,840
Some people

656
00:36:20,096 --> 00:36:21,888
And it's okay

657
00:36:22,144 --> 00:36:23,680
Do not really care

658
00:36:23,936 --> 00:36:25,216
When bad things happen to them

659
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:28,800
I also don't like engaging in schadenfreude

660
00:36:29,056 --> 00:36:35,200
To a certain extent

661
00:36:37,248 --> 00:36:43,392
Like I'm enjoying it in an ironic way I'm not enjoying

662
00:36:43,648 --> 00:36:44,928
Bad person tripping

663
00:36:45,184 --> 00:36:50,304
False I am enjoying the universe providing some small semblance of cosmic

664
00:36:51,328 --> 00:36:52,608
He should die

665
00:36:52,864 --> 00:36:53,376
In the most

666
00:36:53,632 --> 00:36:55,936
Painful possible f****** way that he can

667
00:36:56,192 --> 00:36:57,472
You just described schadenfreude

668
00:36:57,728 --> 00:37:03,872
Anyway, another person just because it

669
00:37:04,128 --> 00:37:08,480
Just because you view it as some sort of cosmic Justice doesn't take away that that's what

670
00:37:08,736 --> 00:37:14,880
Ice cream

671
00:37:15,136 --> 00:37:21,280
Finally gets to that McClatchy article in a

672
00:37:21,536 --> 00:37:24,608
Little bit of us to discuss what he's talkin

673
00:37:25,632 --> 00:37:26,656
Let me go to

674
00:37:31,008 --> 00:37:31,520
The first

675
00:37:35,616 --> 00:37:36,128
Document

676
00:37:36,384 --> 00:37:36,896
That I

677
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:41,248
McClatchy

678
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,064
About 10

679
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,928
This is the speed at which she read the book

680
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,208
Bed bath

681
00:37:51,744 --> 00:37:53,792
It says house

682
00:37:55,328 --> 00:37:56,096
Intelligence

683
00:38:01,728 --> 00:38:02,752
Services

684
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,336
Nmd

685
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:09,152
Committees involved with elections

686
00:38:10,944 --> 00:38:12,480
The big entertainment

687
00:38:15,552 --> 00:38:16,320
And I said

688
00:38:18,624 --> 00:38:19,392
We want

689
00:38:20,416 --> 00:38:20,928
Breitbart

690
00:38:22,464 --> 00:38:25,024
Executive

691
00:38:28,352 --> 00:38:28,864
Where

692
00:38:29,888 --> 00:38:30,656
I would have

693
00:38:32,192 --> 00:38:34,496
Board of Governor members of the FCC

694
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:36,544
AutoZone

695
00:38:37,056 --> 00:38:39,616
Infowars is a Russian intelligence

696
00:38:42,432 --> 00:38:43,200
Snow they said

697
00:38:43,968 --> 00:38:46,528
And we want to shut down

698
00:38:54,976 --> 00:38:56,000
Peace

699
00:38:58,304 --> 00:38:58,816
Mueller

700
00:39:00,608 --> 00:39:02,144
If you in the McClatchy article

701
00:39:02,656 --> 00:39:04,192
In the first place

702
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:05,728
You weren't about

703
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:10,592
Cambridge analytica

704
00:39:11,104 --> 00:39:11,616
They want

705
00:39:12,384 --> 00:39:13,152
Breitbart

706
00:39:14,432 --> 00:39:15,200
They won

707
00:39:15,456 --> 00:39:16,736
Rodger Stone investigated

708
00:39:17,248 --> 00:39:19,296
And they want to know

709
00:39:19,552 --> 00:39:20,576
About 4

710
00:39:21,344 --> 00:39:22,112
9 months

711
00:39:22,368 --> 00:39:24,416
You didn't hear about Alex

712
00:39:24,928 --> 00:39:25,440
You didn't

713
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:27,232
First couple months of 2018

714
00:39:32,608 --> 00:39:35,936
So I want to reach you a couple of choice clips

715
00:39:36,192 --> 00:39:38,752
From this McClatchy article that Alex is talking about

716
00:39:39,008 --> 00:39:39,776
He saying is

717
00:39:40,032 --> 00:39:42,336
Declaring him a Russian agent and all this s***

718
00:39:42,848 --> 00:39:48,736
Operatives to Russia appear to strategically with links to

719
00:39:48,992 --> 00:39:50,016
Pro Trump stories

720
00:39:50,272 --> 00:39:53,344
At times when the billionaire businessman was on the defensive and is racing

721
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:54,368
Democrat Hillary

722
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:55,392
These sources

723
00:39:56,160 --> 00:40:02,304
Investigators examining the body attacks or exploring whether the far-right news operations took any actions to assist Russia

724
00:40:03,072 --> 00:40:07,936
Their participation however wasn't necessary for the box to amplify their news through Twitter and Facebook

725
00:40:08,192 --> 00:40:12,032
They're even in the article making clear that this doesn't mean at all that they were involved

726
00:40:12,288 --> 00:40:15,616
Question that's being that needs to be answered

727
00:40:15,872 --> 00:40:16,896
They're not saying

728
00:40:17,408 --> 00:40:17,920
They did that

729
00:40:18,432 --> 00:40:18,944
Also

730
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:20,480
The article goes on to say

731
00:40:20,736 --> 00:40:26,624
The investigation of the bot engineer traffic which appears to be in its early stages is being driven by the FBI's counterintelligence

732
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:33,024
Division inquiries rarely result in criminal charges and whose main task is to reconstruct the nature of the

733
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:34,304
The Kremlin Cyber attack

734
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:35,328
And determine ways to

735
00:40:35,584 --> 00:40:36,096
Prevent another

736
00:40:36,608 --> 00:40:38,144
It's not even like

737
00:40:39,424 --> 00:40:45,312
Well it's it's a very simple question that you need to ask in order to

738
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:46,848
Get the negative you need

739
00:40:47,104 --> 00:40:47,616
If

740
00:40:48,128 --> 00:40:50,176
Targeting V story

741
00:40:50,688 --> 00:40:51,456
Specifically

742
00:40:52,736 --> 00:40:54,784
In response to specific time

743
00:40:55,808 --> 00:40:56,320
Well

744
00:40:57,088 --> 00:40:58,880
Are they working together

745
00:40:59,136 --> 00:40:59,904
What are the bus

746
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:06,304
Doing it on their own and Tibet the timeline is if this difficult like it if it does come

747
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:08,864
Like a stereotypical

748
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:10,912
Lawyer buddy comes to

749
00:41:11,168 --> 00:41:17,312
Like it does come down to that and that is not immediately apparent that's one of the things that we have difficulty with

750
00:41:17,568 --> 00:41:18,080
Like in terms of

751
00:41:18,336 --> 00:41:19,616
Nailing down specific

752
00:41:20,896 --> 00:41:27,040
He really is he meaning to do this is very like when we when we uncovered in the end of 2015

753
00:41:27,552 --> 00:41:31,136
Alex talking about how he's traffic headed doubled

754
00:41:31,648 --> 00:41:33,696
His sales Wright-Patterson

755
00:41:33,952 --> 00:41:34,720
Risen at all

756
00:41:35,232 --> 00:41:40,096
Is there a cognizant there of why that happened but it's all automated

757
00:41:40,352 --> 00:41:41,120
Or is he

758
00:41:41,376 --> 00:41:42,400
Completely in the dark

759
00:41:42,656 --> 00:41:43,936
And just confused about all fit

760
00:41:44,192 --> 00:41:45,728
We can't know for sure

761
00:41:45,984 --> 00:41:47,008
So we can save

762
00:41:47,264 --> 00:41:48,800
This is what Alex is describing

763
00:41:49,056 --> 00:41:50,336
Right and we know

764
00:41:50,592 --> 00:41:51,616
Pretty clearly

765
00:41:51,872 --> 00:41:56,223
That Insight is being artificially inflated at that time frame don't know

766
00:41:56,479 --> 00:42:02,623
And if you were investigating and you just assumed that there is no connection between

767
00:42:02,879 --> 00:42:09,023
You're not doing your job that's not an investigation now even if the answer even if the answer is no

768
00:42:09,535 --> 00:42:12,607
Likely no possibly no

769
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:17,471
If you don't ask that question and just assume

770
00:42:17,727 --> 00:42:18,751
Because I have to go back to be like

771
00:42:19,519 --> 00:42:20,031
We should look at that

772
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:26,431
Think about all the questions that seem so obvious in retrospect that just were

773
00:42:26,687 --> 00:42:28,223
Assumed

774
00:42:28,479 --> 00:42:30,271
8 +

775
00:42:30,527 --> 00:42:34,623
Like it seems like the simplest question to be like hey were you working with the Russian

776
00:42:35,135 --> 00:42:35,647
End

777
00:42:35,903 --> 00:42:37,183
The answer is no but

778
00:42:37,439 --> 00:42:41,023
If you look at the Russia if you look at Mueller's investigation it's like

779
00:42:41,791 --> 00:42:44,095
Are you guys working the birds with the Russians

780
00:42:44,351 --> 00:42:50,495
What do you mean

781
00:42:50,751 --> 00:42:54,335
More than three questions if you're a better liar

782
00:42:54,591 --> 00:42:55,615
Yeah for sure

783
00:42:56,127 --> 00:42:59,199
I'm so that's that's what article is really a bad like

784
00:42:59,455 --> 00:43:01,759
It's just about like the questions that are coming up

785
00:43:02,271 --> 00:43:02,783
In terms of

786
00:43:03,295 --> 00:43:04,319
The social media site

787
00:43:04,575 --> 00:43:06,879
Because that's where a lot of it

788
00:43:07,135 --> 00:43:08,415
Took place you know like

789
00:43:08,671 --> 00:43:12,255
Hey there's even a quote on this McClatchy article at the end here that is really

790
00:43:12,767 --> 00:43:13,279
Towing

791
00:43:13,535 --> 00:43:16,095
In terms of where that the mindset

792
00:43:16,351 --> 00:43:16,863
The folks work

793
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:23,263
Here's a quote

794
00:43:23,519 --> 00:43:25,055
Someone official made in February twenty

795
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:28,639
It is speech in Moscow Andre

796
00:43:28,895 --> 00:43:29,663
Fruit

797
00:43:30,431 --> 00:43:36,575
Kreutz Creek told a conference of Russian computer security officials that the Putin government would be unleashing a cyber

798
00:43:36,831 --> 00:43:40,415
A nuclear attack reminiscent of Russia's 1949 development of the atom bomb

799
00:43:41,951 --> 00:43:46,303
Trolled whose speech was first reported by Washington Post columnist David Ignatius

800
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:51,167
And independently confirmed by McClatchy also reportedly said that

801
00:43:51,423 --> 00:43:52,703
The gain respect for Russia cyber

802
00:43:53,983 --> 00:43:55,519
So the idea that like

803
00:43:56,287 --> 00:43:57,823
This information space

804
00:43:58,079 --> 00:43:59,615
And social media being such a

805
00:43:59,871 --> 00:44:01,919
A wide-open area

806
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:05,759
That's a very obvious place where investigations would be happy

807
00:44:06,015 --> 00:44:09,599
Listen to like just because he's mentioned

808
00:44:09,855 --> 00:44:10,623
In the article

809
00:44:10,879 --> 00:44:12,415
They don't say like

810
00:44:12,671 --> 00:44:14,463
He's doing this or he's a Russian age

811
00:44:14,975 --> 00:44:17,023
Did they bring him up in terms of like

812
00:44:19,071 --> 00:44:19,839
He posted Lotto

813
00:44:21,887 --> 00:44:24,703
Add Breitbart Infowars are like the two main

814
00:44:24,959 --> 00:44:25,983
Places where

815
00:44:26,495 --> 00:44:28,799
Like stupidly Pro Trump s*** with

816
00:44:32,383 --> 00:44:33,919
Especially in terms of

817
00:44:34,687 --> 00:44:37,503
Very visible voices

818
00:44:37,759 --> 00:44:39,039
I very clearly

819
00:44:40,831 --> 00:44:41,599
And weird

820
00:44:42,111 --> 00:44:42,879
2 with

821
00:44:43,135 --> 00:44:44,159
With no

822
00:44:44,671 --> 00:44:46,463
Pushback not with no flashback

823
00:44:46,719 --> 00:44:52,863
It would be it would be way less suspicious it's at that time they had even one article that was

824
00:44:54,655 --> 00:44:58,495
You know like any one of those people be like well maybe there was a

825
00:44:58,751 --> 00:45:04,895
Maybe there is a difference between the two but if it that right before

826
00:45:05,151 --> 00:45:11,295
Before he switched with 90

827
00:45:11,551 --> 00:45:12,575
Eighty-seven percent you're like

828
00:45:12,831 --> 00:45:15,135
That's suspicious and it's obviously

829
00:45:15,391 --> 00:45:18,207
Brightright 100%

830
00:45:18,463 --> 00:45:22,047
That's suspicious cuz you're not a human being if you're a hundred percent protein

831
00:45:22,303 --> 00:45:22,815
Throw anything

832
00:45:23,071 --> 00:45:27,679
Also Imagine like another election in another country where you have a very prominent

833
00:45:27,935 --> 00:45:29,727
Conspiracy theorist propagandist

834
00:45:29,983 --> 00:45:31,519
Clearly gun-for-hire

835
00:45:31,775 --> 00:45:36,895
Who is like I don't trust this guy he's mobbed-up all this Papa dupa do

836
00:45:37,407 --> 00:45:38,943
I made it

837
00:45:39,199 --> 00:45:42,015
One of that guys close Associates becomes

838
00:45:42,271 --> 00:45:45,855
A major player at his news organizations propaganda outfit

839
00:45:46,111 --> 00:45:48,927
Ryan seemingly all of a suddenly starts

840
00:45:49,183 --> 00:45:52,767
Shifting everything to this guy is the only person who can save us

841
00:45:53,535 --> 00:45:57,375
You not look like if you take it outside of the American context

842
00:45:57,631 --> 00:46:03,775
And put it as just an abstract thing you like I see what's going on personalized it a little

843
00:46:04,031 --> 00:46:06,591
Bit and take it away from the context that we know it in

844
00:46:06,847 --> 00:46:08,127
The picture becomes very

845
00:46:09,151 --> 00:46:09,663
Suspicious

846
00:46:09,919 --> 00:46:15,551
At 1 and 111

847
00:46:21,183 --> 00:46:23,487
Power system analysis

848
00:46:23,999 --> 00:46:26,047
Lenny said something really f***** up about Rodger Stone

849
00:46:26,303 --> 00:46:26,815
Okay

850
00:46:29,375 --> 00:46:32,191
They think you're stupid

851
00:46:32,703 --> 00:46:36,287
Let me know that I think you don't wash long videos he walks like 2 minutes ago the Mavericks

852
00:46:36,799 --> 00:46:40,639
Do you think that and we also do

853
00:46:41,151 --> 00:46:41,663
Because

854
00:46:41,919 --> 00:46:42,943
That elevation for

855
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:47,039
They want to have the fake investigation go forward just have me arrested her

856
00:46:47,295 --> 00:46:49,087
Shut Up and Dance like that trailer

857
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:50,367
You know he's going to jail

858
00:46:52,927 --> 00:46:53,951
Program as well

859
00:46:55,231 --> 00:46:56,255
I'm aware of what they're doing I mean

860
00:46:56,767 --> 00:46:57,279
I've got the

861
00:46:57,535 --> 00:46:58,047
Bird's eye view

862
00:46:58,559 --> 00:46:59,071
Nope

863
00:47:02,399 --> 00:47:02,911
Please

864
00:47:03,679 --> 00:47:04,447
This is an article

865
00:47:04,703 --> 00:47:05,215
From almost a year

866
00:47:06,751 --> 00:47:07,263
40 months

867
00:47:07,519 --> 00:47:09,055
Where you got the Democratic Party

868
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:12,895
We want Alex Jones shutdown

869
00:47:14,431 --> 00:47:16,223
And there is an FBI investigation

870
00:47:17,247 --> 00:47:18,271
Espionage

871
00:47:18,527 --> 00:47:21,599
What's happening now

872
00:47:23,135 --> 00:47:24,415
Lot of people getting indicted

873
00:47:27,999 --> 00:47:29,023
In the last 4 days

874
00:47:30,047 --> 00:47:30,815
Styx

875
00:47:31,071 --> 00:47:32,351
People associate with Rodger

876
00:47:34,911 --> 00:47:35,423
Plays up

877
00:47:36,447 --> 00:47:37,983
Cooperative OSHA

878
00:47:42,847 --> 00:47:45,151
He was involved in Watergate

879
00:47:46,687 --> 00:47:49,503
What do you mean I've never seen you do anything

880
00:47:49,759 --> 00:47:55,647
He works with you

881
00:47:56,159 --> 00:47:57,183
Nonsense

882
00:47:58,207 --> 00:48:00,511
Crazy music

883
00:48:01,279 --> 00:48:07,423
Wow that's amazing

884
00:48:07,679 --> 00:48:09,727
Everything everything

885
00:48:10,239 --> 00:48:11,519
Everything

886
00:48:11,775 --> 00:48:12,287
Bright

887
00:48:12,799 --> 00:48:18,943
This is the new strategy no problem

888
00:48:19,199 --> 00:48:25,343
A mugshot of an appointment with Ferdinand Marcos

889
00:48:29,439 --> 00:48:35,583
Consultancy firm with Lee Atwater and Palmetto

890
00:48:35,839 --> 00:48:40,703
Official said and said he was just a rat who's always on the edges

891
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:53,503
Politically correct

892
00:48:56,063 --> 00:49:00,415
That to me is a tell pathetic self

893
00:49:00,671 --> 00:49:06,815
Other times we talked about Rodger he's been like he'd been involved in the deepest levels of

894
00:49:07,071 --> 00:49:11,935
Reddit when you introduced him on Infowars

895
00:49:12,191 --> 00:49:12,959
This guy

896
00:49:13,215 --> 00:49:14,239
Is involved

897
00:49:14,495 --> 00:49:17,311
Cesar ratfucker

898
00:49:17,567 --> 00:49:19,103
Yeah I mean

899
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:20,383
That's hilarious

900
00:49:20,895 --> 00:49:21,407
So good

901
00:49:25,247 --> 00:49:26,271
Do you mean he pushes on us

902
00:49:27,551 --> 00:49:28,319
And so

903
00:49:31,135 --> 00:49:33,439
Grab Michael R Caputo orbitron

904
00:49:34,463 --> 00:49:35,487
They grabbed a bunch of other

905
00:49:35,743 --> 00:49:36,255
People

906
00:49:38,815 --> 00:49:40,095
For 8 hours 6 hours

907
00:49:40,351 --> 00:49:40,863
3 hours

908
00:49:43,679 --> 00:49:45,727
They just keep going back to Alex Jones so Alex

909
00:49:47,519 --> 00:49:48,543
What like

910
00:49:49,311 --> 00:49:50,079
Alex Jones

911
00:49:56,223 --> 00:49:56,991
Kumon

912
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:01,087
Rodger Stone

913
00:50:04,671 --> 00:50:05,183
Commentator

914
00:50:05,695 --> 00:50:07,487
Just lucky

915
00:50:12,607 --> 00:50:13,119
Houses

916
00:50:13,375 --> 00:50:17,471
Keep saying racist s*** on the aircraft that

917
00:50:17,727 --> 00:50:22,335
About like

918
00:50:22,591 --> 00:50:28,735
Probably like you use in charge of everything in for there's not another guy they running things by

919
00:50:28,991 --> 00:50:35,135
There is no robbed who's actually there the power player by the Puppet Master

920
00:50:35,391 --> 00:50:38,975
I'm sure that that's more of the questions are asked

921
00:50:39,743 --> 00:50:41,791
I would say any investigation repair Alexa

922
00:50:43,327 --> 00:50:44,607
Do you know if they talk to the Russian

923
00:50:46,911 --> 00:50:50,751
The podcast run out of my bedroom between two dudes

924
00:50:51,007 --> 00:50:57,151
Who are busy in other aspects of their life

925
00:51:01,503 --> 00:51:03,295
If I were

926
00:51:03,551 --> 00:51:05,343
Why ask people questions

927
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:11,743
Just listen to Alex's show he tells you all the answers if I were working for law enforcement

928
00:51:11,999 --> 00:51:13,535
What I would do is I would make Alex

929
00:51:14,047 --> 00:51:15,327
I do an interview on her own

930
00:51:15,583 --> 00:51:17,887
Never spoken to Russian intelligence

931
00:51:18,399 --> 00:51:19,679
And then you would say no

932
00:51:20,191 --> 00:51:21,727
I mean I would bring up that clip

933
00:51:21,983 --> 00:51:24,799
And be like would you like to discuss what you were talking about there

934
00:51:25,055 --> 00:51:26,847
Either have him admit

935
00:51:27,103 --> 00:51:33,247
That you made up the entire story or federal investigators

936
00:51:33,503 --> 00:51:35,807
81 you do the other nobigdyl

937
00:51:36,063 --> 00:51:42,207
For himself

938
00:51:42,463 --> 00:51:44,511
Did you talk to Russian intelligence

939
00:51:44,767 --> 00:51:46,047
Where you have spoken to

940
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:50,655
You have had Alexander Dugan on yourself multiple times

941
00:51:50,911 --> 00:51:54,239
Right after the election you were on his show and he told you that you were

942
00:51:55,263 --> 00:52:01,407
Greatest example of an American that he's ever seeing it anti-americanism is over in Russia because of you

943
00:52:01,663 --> 00:52:04,479
And here's how you would get Alex to tell the truth you be like

944
00:52:04,735 --> 00:52:07,039
And we agree and I was like okay sweet

945
00:52:07,295 --> 00:52:11,391
Let me tell you all this s*** for the Russian Film might be better angles

946
00:52:17,279 --> 00:52:21,631
Esbi but secretly were on both drop

947
00:52:21,887 --> 00:52:22,911
Hey for real

948
00:52:25,215 --> 00:52:27,775
Tell everybody about this interview

949
00:52:28,287 --> 00:52:30,847
What you said

950
00:52:31,103 --> 00:52:33,407
Look tell them what we told you

951
00:52:33,663 --> 00:52:37,759
You're the greatest for the BET Alex

952
00:52:42,879 --> 00:52:43,391
Too easy

953
00:52:46,207 --> 00:52:46,719
So Alex

954
00:52:46,975 --> 00:52:47,487
At this point

955
00:52:47,743 --> 00:52:48,511
Presents

956
00:52:49,023 --> 00:52:50,047
Theory that he has

957
00:52:50,303 --> 00:52:53,887
But he is a victim of grbl style propaganda

958
00:52:54,143 --> 00:52:54,655
Clearly

959
00:52:54,911 --> 00:52:55,679
Here's the king

960
00:52:56,959 --> 00:52:58,239
This is being done

961
00:52:59,519 --> 00:53:01,311
Politically and culturally

962
00:53:01,567 --> 00:53:02,335
Assassinate

963
00:53:02,591 --> 00:53:03,103
My character

964
00:53:03,871 --> 00:53:05,151
And make me a bad guy

965
00:53:05,663 --> 00:53:07,455
Show that people believe

966
00:53:07,967 --> 00:53:08,479
Something

967
00:53:08,735 --> 00:53:10,527
Credible

968
00:53:11,295 --> 00:53:13,087
Joseph Goebbels the cheese nachos

969
00:53:13,343 --> 00:53:15,647
Whom I ever admired in the past

970
00:53:17,439 --> 00:53:18,463
Just for fun

971
00:53:18,719 --> 00:53:21,791
Gerbils was largely inspired by Edward Bernays

972
00:53:22,047 --> 00:53:25,119
His work ahead of an A-frame Jerome corsi

973
00:53:25,375 --> 00:53:29,727
Who works for Infowars Six Degrees of girdles

974
00:53:30,751 --> 00:53:31,263
Big Lots

975
00:53:33,055 --> 00:53:36,383
Done the propaganda but also

976
00:53:36,639 --> 00:53:38,175
Go over-the-top with Allah

977
00:53:38,943 --> 00:53:40,735
That perfectly describes Infowars

978
00:53:41,247 --> 00:53:44,063
It's very stupid stuff it's very dumb

979
00:53:44,319 --> 00:53:49,439
The point where it's accessible if you dropped out of third grade and you are just angry

980
00:53:49,695 --> 00:53:51,999
And I don't know anything about the world

981
00:53:52,255 --> 00:53:54,303
It's accessible by the way

982
00:53:54,815 --> 00:53:55,583
Wesley Snipes

983
00:53:56,095 --> 00:54:01,471
Was in Major League

984
00:54:01,727 --> 00:54:02,495
Alex Jones

985
00:54:02,751 --> 00:54:05,311
Has Jerome corsi working for him

986
00:54:08,639 --> 00:54:10,175
6 degrees away from

987
00:54:10,431 --> 00:54:12,735
Grbl I could go quicker

988
00:54:13,247 --> 00:54:19,391
I was trying to go as far away in the weirdest possible way Wesley Snipes

989
00:54:19,647 --> 00:54:24,255
Fat white gerbils

990
00:54:24,511 --> 00:54:26,047
Wesley Snipes didn't pay his taxes

991
00:54:26,303 --> 00:54:26,815
Right

992
00:54:27,071 --> 00:54:33,215
Irwin Schiff says you shouldn't pay your taxes and Son Peter Schiff was on Alex's show

993
00:54:33,471 --> 00:54:36,287
Jerome corsi Jerome corsi bearnaise bearnaise grbl

994
00:54:36,543 --> 00:54:37,055
Ducks

995
00:54:40,895 --> 00:54:43,199
None of those were movie

996
00:54:44,223 --> 00:54:50,367
The victim of a big lie style like it

997
00:54:50,623 --> 00:54:55,487
It's just so big that they would lie like that

998
00:54:55,743 --> 00:54:56,255
You

999
00:54:57,023 --> 00:54:59,839
Your globalist thing is the biggest lie of all like that's

1000
00:55:01,375 --> 00:55:04,191
It says that they drink children's blood in Lake the thing

1001
00:55:04,447 --> 00:55:10,591
Say they're demonic and they're possessed by a force outside of our Dimension or whatever like

1002
00:55:10,847 --> 00:55:12,383
Big Lot

1003

Tiger

1004
00:55:16,735 --> 00:55:17,759
It's the biggest lie

1005
00:55:18,015 --> 00:55:24,159
Is a lot

1006
00:55:24,415 --> 00:55:25,951
Starts complaining about property

1007
00:55:26,463 --> 00:55:28,767
It becomes like this weird Ouroboros

1008
00:55:29,791 --> 00:55:33,119
I didn't know you could do

1009
00:55:33,375 --> 00:55:35,679
Thrilled that your audience is that dumb that they don't

1010
00:55:35,935 --> 00:55:36,703
See-through like

1011
00:55:36,959 --> 00:55:37,471
When you

1012
00:55:37,727 --> 00:55:39,519
Talk about propaganda

1013
00:55:40,031 --> 00:55:44,127
It accurately describes your show and it's just a treat

1014
00:55:44,383 --> 00:55:44,895
The people don't see

1015
00:55:45,151 --> 00:55:45,663
See through

1016
00:55:46,175 --> 00:55:46,687
Anyways

1017
00:55:46,943 --> 00:55:49,759
Yeah your only response to that if you're propagandist

1018
00:55:50,015 --> 00:55:51,039
Legitimately should be like

1019
00:55:51,807 --> 00:55:54,623
Game recognize game man I don't know what to tell you that guy is

1020

1021
00:55:56,159 --> 00:55:57,951
Don't know what is really all about

1022
00:56:00,511 --> 00:56:01,791
I do it's all about the

1023
00:56:02,047 --> 00:56:02,559
Destroying

1024
00:56:03,071 --> 00:56:05,887
The family real media has

1025
00:56:06,399 --> 00:56:07,423
They are demonized

1026
00:56:08,703 --> 00:56:09,215

A new score

1033
00:56:23,551 --> 00:56:24,063
Three months

1034
00:56:24,319 --> 00:56:26,623
In the Wall Street Journal

1035
00:56:27,135 --> 00:56:29,951
We're going to Alex Jones and Isis

1036
00:56:30,207 --> 00:56:34,303
Weird real everybody

1037
00:56:36,351 --> 00:56:38,399
I kind of put them all together though I'm I'm down

1038
00:56:38,911 --> 00:56:43,263
I'm done with that platform. Then it'll just be 100 Corporation

1039
00:56:46,591 --> 00:56:47,871
So that's what I'll be allowed on Twitter face

1040
00:56:48,127 --> 00:56:51,199
New Supermarket Sweep 100 corporations are less

1041
00:56:52,735 --> 00:56:55,039
Support

Debt

1043
00:57:03,743 --> 00:57:05,023
Once they get me

1044
00:57:08,095 --> 00:57:08,863
They're going to get you

1045
00:57:10,655 --> 00:57:11,167
Howard

1046
00:57:12,703 --> 00:57:14,239
The guy that was a long time ago

1047
00:57:14,495 --> 00:57:15,775
I'm following this course

1048
00:57:16,031 --> 00:57:16,543
To the end

1049
00:57:18,079 --> 00:57:19,615
I'm just ashamed that

1050
00:57:21,151 --> 00:57:22,687
When push comes to shove down

1051
00:57:26,271 --> 00:57:27,551
This is not the time or place

1052
00:57:29,855 --> 00:57:30,623
2000's rock

1053
00:57:31,391 --> 00:57:32,159
Debatably

1054
00:57:32,415 --> 00:57:33,183
The opposite

1055
00:57:33,439 --> 00:57:34,207
Is proven to be true

1056
00:57:34,463 --> 00:57:37,535
For you

1057
00:57:37,791 --> 00:57:39,327
I agree with her

1058
00:57:39,583 --> 00:57:45,727
I don't like those idiots should be backing out

1059
00:57:45,983 --> 00:57:48,031
Cuz if they do get Alex Jones

1060
00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:52,639
They can go for what it what is brightburn the daily color but Alex Jones

1061
00:57:52,895 --> 00:57:59,039
Bradford Exchange considerably

1062
00:57:59,295 --> 00:58:02,367
Alex Jones for the time. Where he was the b**** that

1063
00:58:06,463 --> 00:58:06,975
There's a great

1064
00:58:07,231 --> 00:58:13,375
Here's the ears the real issue cuz I proposed that thought experiment where we live

1065
00:58:13,631 --> 00:58:17,215
Looked at Alex Jones his pivot outside of America for a second there

1066
00:58:17,471 --> 00:58:19,775
I want to take this to another

1067
00:58:20,031 --> 00:58:22,079
What we need to do is we need to take politics

1068
00:58:22,591 --> 00:58:27,199
Actual rhetoric kind of out of it is a bunch of people who are running

1069
00:58:27,455 --> 00:58:32,831
Stamps the running various caught collar Breitbart

1070
00:58:33,087 --> 00:58:36,927
Infowars all running cons of different

1071
00:58:37,951 --> 00:58:38,463
Description

1072
00:58:38,975 --> 00:58:45,119
Most of it is about clickbait most of it is about driving traffic with Alex for a long time is about selling gold for 10 a.m.

1073
00:58:45,375 --> 00:58:47,935
And then it became selling

1074
00:58:48,191 --> 00:58:49,471
Weirdo supplements

1075
00:58:49,983 --> 00:58:51,007
For Breitbart

1076
00:58:52,031 --> 00:58:54,335
Very high

1077
00:58:55,359 --> 00:58:56,639
In terms of ads they could sell

1078
00:58:56,895 --> 00:59:01,759
Same thing with Daily Caller there a lot of Publications aren't really interested in

1079
00:59:02,015 --> 00:59:03,807
Publishing realshit there about

1080
00:59:04,063 --> 00:59:04,575
Like a scam

1081
00:59:04,831 --> 00:59:06,879
They're running a scam

1082
00:59:07,647 --> 00:59:08,415
They all do it

1083
00:59:08,671 --> 00:59:09,183
They should

1084
00:59:09,439 --> 00:59:11,999
And so when one of them gets put in the hopper

1085
00:59:13,023 --> 00:59:13,791
Plano

1086
00:59:14,047 --> 00:59:15,583
That the other person knows

1087
00:59:16,351 --> 00:59:17,375
That they're running a scam

1088
00:59:17,631 --> 00:59:21,215
You and I were both guys were running online scam

1089
00:59:22,239 --> 00:59:23,775
Because of your behavior

1090
00:59:24,031 --> 00:59:25,823
You were getting investigated for something

1091
00:59:26,335 --> 00:59:27,359
I would also back off

1092
00:59:27,615 --> 00:59:28,127
From you

1093
00:59:28,383 --> 00:59:30,431
Because I don't want my scam to blow up

1094
00:59:30,687 --> 00:59:32,223
And it's not going to

1095
00:59:32,735 --> 00:59:38,879
This isn't going to spill over into all of conservative media you're buying another slippery slope argument that

1096
00:59:39,135 --> 00:59:42,463
Believe in America and that is

1097
00:59:42,719 --> 00:59:45,279
Scammers all hang together or they all hang separately

1098
00:59:45,535 --> 00:59:48,095
Not true at all they're going to survive

1099
00:59:48,351 --> 00:59:50,399
The f*** away from the Heat

1100
00:59:57,311 --> 01:00:03,455
Yeah it's just too much to it there's too much.

1101
01:00:03,711 --> 01:00:04,223
Get into this

1102
01:00:04,479 --> 01:00:07,039
There's a investigations of these people

1103
01:00:08,831 --> 01:00:09,599
Resources

1104
01:00:10,111 --> 01:00:10,879
You know in terms of

1105
01:00:11,135 --> 01:00:17,279
Yeah it's a necessary one that would improve the lives of everyone

1106
01:00:17,535 --> 01:00:19,327
Certain extent we're not

1107
01:00:21,119 --> 01:00:22,143
I think I'm doing that with Alex

1108
01:00:23,423 --> 01:00:29,567
It's realistic results in 2009 but you f****** don't want to hear it.

1109
01:00:34,175 --> 01:00:35,967
Give me your 14 months all day

1110
01:00:37,247 --> 01:00:38,271
Anyway

1111
01:00:38,783 --> 01:00:39,551
Alex manly

1112
01:00:40,063 --> 01:00:40,831
Do you want to talk about in the

1113
01:00:41,343 --> 01:00:43,647
That makes sense now is the right time to say that

1114
01:00:43,903 --> 01:00:47,231
Very weird that I think

1115
01:00:47,487 --> 01:00:48,511
Indicates that he's stupid

1116
01:00:49,791 --> 01:00:52,095
The globalist are

1117
01:00:53,887 --> 01:00:55,167
That I'm one of their biggest threats

1118
01:00:56,959 --> 01:00:57,727
And that

1119
01:00:59,007 --> 01:00:59,519
I'm

1120
01:01:01,567 --> 01:01:02,079
The focus

1121
01:01:02,847 --> 01:01:03,359
Dedicated

1122
01:01:04,895 --> 01:01:05,663
Watch Northstar

1123
01:01:05,919 --> 01:01:06,687
Rock

1124
01:01:12,063 --> 01:01:12,831
Remember growing up

1125
01:01:14,623 --> 01:01:15,903
They were the biggest bullies

1126
01:01:27,679 --> 01:01:28,191
White Chicks

1127
01:01:31,263 --> 01:01:32,031
I just noticed

1128
01:01:34,335 --> 01:01:37,151
Cowboy Hamdi ulukaya would disagree

1129
01:01:40,223 --> 01:01:42,527
Because out of what we do here just like the Alamo

1130
01:01:43,039 --> 01:01:43,807
1836

1131
01:01:44,575 --> 01:01:46,367
Will come example.

1132
01:01:47,135 --> 01:01:48,927
They were the bad guys

1133
01:01:49,439 --> 01:01:51,231
That was like

1134
01:01:51,487 --> 01:01:55,071
Is incredibly strong person with the old young black white male feet

1135
01:01:59,423 --> 01:02:01,215
But it's all the so-called smart

1136
01:02:16,063 --> 01:02:16,575
Still pausing

1137
01:02:17,855 --> 01:02:18,367
Pausing

1138
01:02:18,879 --> 01:02:19,391
The globalist

1139
01:02:19,647 --> 01:02:20,159
There we go

1140
01:02:21,695 --> 01:02:22,975
Used modern society

1141
01:02:23,487 --> 01:02:23,999
Lexi

1142
01:02:31,167 --> 01:02:33,727
You know what the globalist couldn't Ricky with you or like

1143
01:02:33,983 --> 01:02:37,055
You have a potato I have a peach let's trade

1144
01:02:37,567 --> 01:02:39,359
They couldn't I couldn't talk.

1145
01:02:39,615 --> 01:02:40,639
Everything was

1146
01:02:41,151 --> 01:02:42,431
Resource-based barter

1147
01:02:43,199 --> 01:02:46,527
I understand what you saying but what he's kind of saying

1148
01:02:46,783 --> 01:02:47,295
Is

1149
01:02:47,807 --> 01:02:48,831
They're doing what I'm doing

1150
01:02:49,343 --> 01:02:49,855
No

1151
01:02:50,111 --> 01:02:53,439
I don't think I don't think that's the case because I don't think anyone's manipulating

1152
01:02:53,695 --> 01:02:58,303
Because of complexity Alex's saying

1153
01:02:59,071 --> 01:02:59,839
Man

1154
01:03:00,351 --> 01:03:02,143
I can't figure out the world

1155
01:03:03,167 --> 01:03:03,679
Well that's

1156
01:03:03,935 --> 01:03:08,543
That's actually a good that's a really good point because what I'm hearing it throughout this entire thing

1157
01:03:08,799 --> 01:03:10,335
Is that Alex is

1158
01:03:11,103 --> 01:03:11,615
People walk

1159
01:03:11,871 --> 01:03:15,967
You said all of these long pauses are hippie and like

1160
01:03:16,479 --> 01:03:19,039
I really can't figure out this game

1161
01:03:19,551 --> 01:03:20,575
And usually

1162
01:03:20,831 --> 01:03:21,855
I can figure out

1163
01:03:22,111 --> 01:03:22,623
Against

1164
01:03:22,879 --> 01:03:26,463
I think there's a piece of that and I think that's because

1165
01:03:26,975 --> 01:03:28,511
Back to the wall he doesn't have any

1166
01:03:28,767 --> 01:03:31,327
You don't like in terms of his worldview In-N-Out

1167
01:03:31,583 --> 01:03:35,935
He can rattle off subsections that article headlines and stuff

1168
01:03:40,287 --> 01:03:43,615
If Alex had to prove his case like let's say in a quart

1169
01:03:43,871 --> 01:03:45,151
He knows he can't do it

1170
01:03:46,943 --> 01:03:50,015
Probably because you had to do some dark soul searching lately

1171
01:03:50,271 --> 01:03:51,551
But

1172
01:03:52,063 --> 01:03:53,855
So there's a piece of that where he's like

1173
01:03:54,367 --> 01:03:55,647
My-oh-my flowery languages

1174
01:03:56,671 --> 01:03:57,439
All for naught

1175
01:03:57,695 --> 01:03:59,231
There's there's a part of that I think it's a

1176
01:03:59,743 --> 01:04:01,535
I know there's another part that I think

1177
01:04:01,791 --> 01:04:03,583
I have a I have a thesis

1178
01:04:04,095 --> 01:04:04,863
And I think

1179
01:04:05,887 --> 01:04:06,911
I think Alex is about

1180
01:04:07,423 --> 01:04:07,935
Sellout

1181
01:04:08,959 --> 01:04:09,471
How so

1182
01:04:09,983 --> 01:04:10,495
Well

1183
01:04:10,751 --> 01:04:12,287
Which which direction are we going

1184
01:04:12,799 --> 01:04:18,943
I want to wait till a little bit later to explain my theory that will help make my point

1185
01:04:19,199 --> 01:04:19,711
Teasing

1186
01:04:19,967 --> 01:04:23,295
Bullshiter are the Galaxy's getting ready to jump off the

1187
01:04:24,063 --> 01:04:25,855
Maybe you can cash out quite frankly

1188
01:04:26,111 --> 01:04:28,415
Oh like for real well

1189
01:04:28,671 --> 01:04:34,815
I will call it a f****** night I'm not entirely sure and we've made so many stupid predictions in the past

1190
01:04:35,071 --> 01:04:38,655
Just going by

1191
01:04:41,471 --> 01:04:43,007
I'm kind of a natural

1192
01:04:43,263 --> 01:04:44,799
Conclusion of where this is going to go

1193
01:04:45,823 --> 01:04:48,895
I can keep saying the Trump is rolling up had a file on that works

1194
01:04:49,407 --> 01:04:49,919
Destroying

1195
01:04:50,175 --> 01:04:50,943
The globalist

1196
01:04:51,711 --> 01:04:55,807
He can keep saying he's a global at the internationalist I do want to take the guns early

1197
01:04:56,063 --> 01:05:00,671
You can keep attacking people when I say that I it's no big deal that he doesn't

1198
01:05:01,183 --> 01:05:01,951
You either

1199
01:05:02,207 --> 01:05:06,303
I can't push this much further I've kind of come to the end of it

1200
01:05:06,559 --> 01:05:07,583
And so I think

1201
01:05:08,351 --> 01:05:13,471
I think there's a bit of it in this in this special report because

1202
01:05:13,727 --> 01:05:19,871
Right now his bullheadedness suggest that he's going to he's going to flame out the way that he's supposed to which is

1203
01:05:20,895 --> 01:05:23,199
Pile of ignominy

1204
01:05:23,455 --> 01:05:25,759
But for now Alex explains

1205
01:05:26,015 --> 01:05:27,295
That's not quite happy

1206
01:05:27,807 --> 01:05:28,319
Super Auto

1207
01:05:29,855 --> 01:05:30,623
Because they're scum

1208
01:05:31,135 --> 01:05:32,159
Real quick I want to save it

1209
01:05:32,415 --> 01:05:33,951
This also feeds into my theory

1210
01:05:34,207 --> 01:05:36,511
He keeps talking about how he is the last

1211
01:05:36,767 --> 01:05:37,279
Man

1212
01:05:37,535 --> 01:05:42,911
He's honorable and all that stuff part of me like the build-up to The Prestige

1213
01:05:43,423 --> 01:05:45,471
Do certain extent

1214
01:05:45,727 --> 01:05:48,543
He's got to go John Wayne in the Searchers and just like

1215
01:05:48,799 --> 01:05:52,383
Walk away from the building and sacrifice

1216
01:05:52,639 --> 01:05:54,175
They're the only people that will

1217
01:05:55,455 --> 01:05:55,967
Corruption

1218
01:05:56,735 --> 01:05:58,015
That zone of corruption

1219
01:05:58,783 --> 01:05:59,807
People

1220
01:06:00,831 --> 01:06:03,647
He's able to siphon off of the largesse of humanity

1221
01:06:03,903 --> 01:06:04,415
Build

1222
01:06:04,927 --> 01:06:05,951
Strata

1223
01:06:06,207 --> 01:06:09,023
Also if this doesn't make sense don't worry it doesn't

1224
01:06:09,279 --> 01:06:12,095
Really bad

1225
01:06:12,351 --> 01:06:13,119
Sociopathic

1226
01:06:13,631 --> 01:06:14,655
Sadistic people

1227
01:06:15,935 --> 01:06:16,703
Who's in

1228
01:06:16,959 --> 01:06:18,751
Shark

1229
01:06:19,263 --> 01:06:21,311
Control

1230
01:06:24,383 --> 01:06:25,407
Honorable strong

1231
01:06:26,175 --> 01:06:26,687
Truthful

1232
01:06:27,455 --> 01:06:28,223
Feel

1233
01:06:28,735 --> 01:06:29,247
Defeated

1234
01:06:29,759 --> 01:06:32,063
Always trying to extinguish freedom

1235
01:06:33,599 --> 01:06:34,623
Turn off the Great

1236
01:06:43,839 --> 01:06:46,911
Extinguish the light because it reminds them of what

1237
01:06:47,679 --> 01:06:49,215
Horribly Fallen cowardly

1238
01:06:52,031 --> 01:06:52,543
Checks out

1239
01:06:54,847 --> 01:06:56,127
I chose my

1240
01:06:56,639 --> 01:06:57,407
Chose

1241
01:06:58,431 --> 01:06:59,455
That's not how Destiny work

1242
01:06:59,967 --> 01:07:02,015
Strong truthful

1243
01:07:02,527 --> 01:07:03,551
Let me know

1244
01:07:04,575 --> 01:07:05,599
Many

1245
01:07:08,671 --> 01:07:09,183
Right

1246
01:07:12,511 --> 01:07:13,791
Heat-seeking missile

1247
01:07:14,303 --> 01:07:15,583
Because

1248
01:07:16,607 --> 01:07:17,119
.

1249
01:07:18,911 --> 01:07:20,959
I'm going to blow his ass up

1250
01:07:21,215 --> 01:07:21,727
What's up

1251
01:07:39,647 --> 01:07:45,023
Defeated man kind of presenting himself

1252
01:07:45,279 --> 01:07:46,303
Be good I chose my dad

1253
01:07:46,815 --> 01:07:48,351
I chose to be honorable

1254
01:07:49,119 --> 01:07:49,631
GameStop

1255
01:07:49,887 --> 01:07:52,959
But like that's why they sent me is a villain

1256
01:07:54,239 --> 01:08:00,383
He knows very well on some level that once they start really releasing information that they have on Rodger Stone

1257
01:08:00,639 --> 01:08:03,967
It All Leads

1258
01:08:04,223 --> 01:08:08,063
In Cahoots with Russia or anything like that but really problematic

1259
01:08:08,319 --> 01:08:09,855
Difficult questions to answer

1260
01:08:10,367 --> 01:08:11,391
About

1261
01:08:11,647 --> 01:08:12,415
What were you doing

1262
01:08:13,183 --> 01:08:13,951
Didn't worry

1263
01:08:14,207 --> 01:08:14,975
How could you

1264
01:08:15,231 --> 01:08:17,535
A very short FBI deposition

1265
01:08:17,791 --> 01:08:19,071
How could you up to

1266
01:08:19,327 --> 01:08:25,471
I did all that s*** I was asking you just a very simple question whatever it is

1267
01:08:25,727 --> 01:08:31,871
Totally did a plausible kind of reality were you unaware of what was going on

1268
01:08:40,063 --> 01:08:41,087
Back when it was like

1269
01:08:41,343 --> 01:08:43,903
Rodger Stone got taken in for questioning that like

1270
01:08:44,159 --> 01:08:46,719
Wasn't on the record and wasn't under oath

1271
01:08:46,975 --> 01:08:47,743
Like you can

1272
01:08:47,999 --> 01:08:53,631
Spin mat and be like

1273
01:08:53,887 --> 01:08:58,495
You can play top with that but like

1274
01:08:58,751 --> 01:09:02,079
This Thread is getting pulled sweater is coming undone

1275
01:09:02,335 --> 01:09:06,175
You know like it's going

1276
01:09:06,431 --> 01:09:06,943
EXO

1277
01:09:07,455 --> 01:09:10,783
Again the fact that stone is still in this country boggles my mind

1278
01:09:11,551 --> 01:09:12,831
I guess I got a deal

1279
01:09:13,087 --> 01:09:14,367
But either way

1280
01:09:14,879 --> 01:09:20,511
At whatever rate which is going to try and say instead of from now on

1281
01:09:20,767 --> 01:09:21,535
Alex

1282
01:09:21,791 --> 01:09:25,375
This whole time has been saying that he's going to get to his message to Mueller

1283
01:09:26,399 --> 01:09:31,775
He's going to give him a WWE imagine

1284
01:09:32,543 --> 01:09:34,847
What he's going to accuse Mueller of doing

1285
01:09:35,103 --> 01:09:36,383
In this next clip

1286
01:09:37,151 --> 01:09:38,175
BFDI

1287
01:09:38,943 --> 01:09:40,479
Bestiality

1288
01:09:43,039 --> 01:09:44,831
Trying to set me up

1289
01:09:45,599 --> 01:09:46,367
Overtime

1290
01:09:47,135 --> 01:09:48,415
Working on trying to find

1291
01:09:49,183 --> 01:09:50,207
Something wrong

1292
01:09:51,743 --> 01:09:53,279
Cointelpro

1293
01:09:55,071 --> 01:09:55,839
I'm not afraid

1294
01:09:56,351 --> 01:09:57,119
I'm not the game Life

1295
01:09:58,399 --> 01:09:59,935
I'm not trying to join the system

1296
01:10:02,239 --> 01:10:03,519
The threats

1297
01:10:05,823 --> 01:10:06,335
Stronger

1298
01:10:09,919 --> 01:10:10,943
My message is this

1299
01:10:11,199 --> 01:10:11,711
Robert

1300
01:10:11,967 --> 01:10:12,479
Mueller

1301
01:10:13,759 --> 01:10:14,271
Robert

1302
01:10:15,295 --> 01:10:17,343
I know what you did

1303
01:10:18,879 --> 01:10:19,391
And I know

1304
01:10:20,415 --> 01:10:26,559
Real quick because you said was up over it I Know What You Did in Vietnam

1305
01:10:28,607 --> 01:10:30,143
Clarify

1306
01:10:30,399 --> 01:10:36,543
What Robert Mueller Vietnam I think this is corsi's influence cuz you know he did the Swift boat s*** I think he's probably like

1307
01:10:38,591 --> 01:10:40,895
Okay I guess what everyone in the mirror

1308
01:10:41,919 --> 01:10:48,063
In America

1309
01:10:48,319 --> 01:10:50,111
The soldiers that were there at doing bad

1310
01:10:50,367 --> 01:10:51,903
Things but the mission was bad

1311
01:10:52,159 --> 01:10:54,719
Did a lot of really f***** up stuff

1312
01:10:55,231 --> 01:10:55,743
So

1313
01:10:56,511 --> 01:10:57,791
The blame goes a lot of Direction

1314
01:10:59,327 --> 01:11:00,095
Also let's be

1315
01:11:00,351 --> 01:11:00,863
Super clear

1316
01:11:01,375 --> 01:11:02,143
You can't just say that

1317
01:11:02,399 --> 01:11:08,543
PewDiePie it's probably a smart idea like when I say I didn't want to half

1318
01:11:08,799 --> 01:11:12,127
The director of the CIA I'm going to say that because

1319
01:11:12,383 --> 01:11:18,271
She tortured people personally

1320
01:11:18,527 --> 01:11:20,063
What happens beyond that

1321
01:11:20,575 --> 01:11:23,135
People should qualify

1322
01:11:23,391 --> 01:11:23,903
No

1323
01:11:24,159 --> 01:11:25,439
No the answer is no

1324
01:11:25,695 --> 01:11:26,463
The answer is no

1325
01:11:26,719 --> 01:11:32,863
And I will tell you why because of the equivalent for Alex

1326
01:11:33,119 --> 01:11:33,631
Should be like

1327
01:11:34,399 --> 01:11:35,935
I don't like her cuz but you did in the war

1328
01:11:36,447 --> 01:11:37,215
What do you mean

1329
01:11:38,495 --> 01:11:41,055
I Know What You Did in Vietnam Robert Mueller

1330
01:11:48,735 --> 01:11:49,759
And I also know

1331
01:11:50,527 --> 01:11:51,039
Recruited by

1332
01:11:51,807 --> 01:11:53,855
John P O'Neill was recruited by the CIA

1333
01:11:55,391 --> 01:11:57,695
I understand O'Neal

1334
01:11:59,231 --> 01:11:59,743
Okay

1335
01:12:02,815 --> 01:12:03,327
Alright

1336
01:12:05,887 --> 01:12:07,423
Before he dies that's pretty

1337
01:12:10,495 --> 01:12:11,263
I know

1338
01:12:11,775 --> 01:12:13,823
You were involved in the group sabatini's

1339
01:12:14,079 --> 01:12:14,847
Destroyed the World Trade

1340
01:12:20,479 --> 01:12:21,247
I know you're a killer

1341
01:12:22,271 --> 01:12:23,039
I know you were

1342
01:12:24,063 --> 01:12:24,575
Killed

1343
01:12:26,367 --> 01:12:27,391
Okay so now

1344
01:12:30,207 --> 01:12:30,975
That Bruce

1345
01:12:31,487 --> 01:12:32,255
Edwards Ivan

1346
01:12:33,791 --> 01:12:34,559
Want it down

1347
01:12:35,839 --> 01:12:37,119
The other not third noun

1348
01:12:37,375 --> 01:12:38,911
I remember

1349
01:12:46,591 --> 01:12:47,103
Wait what

1350
01:12:47,359 --> 01:12:48,895
You'll kill an army scientist

1351
01:12:49,151 --> 01:12:49,919
Avocet

1352
01:12:52,479 --> 01:12:54,015
Let me see what happens

1353
01:12:57,343 --> 01:12:58,879
They had a counter-terrorism tfbi

1354
01:13:01,951 --> 01:13:02,719
I know you're cold-blooded

1355
01:13:07,583 --> 01:13:09,119
Worship the dark Ultra people

1356
01:13:09,887 --> 01:13:10,399
But I don't worship

1357
01:13:11,423 --> 01:13:11,935
Cool

1358
01:13:12,191 --> 01:13:15,519
Which one there's a lot of

1359
01:13:16,031 --> 01:13:20,895
John O'Neill expert

1360
01:13:21,151 --> 01:13:22,687
Before we go any further

1361
01:13:22,943 --> 01:13:23,967
Mueller did 9/11

1362
01:13:24,479 --> 01:13:30,623
That's what he says 23 on release pages

1363
01:13:30,879 --> 01:13:35,487
Mueller did that

1364
01:13:35,743 --> 01:13:41,887
Clean bill of health

1365
01:13:42,143 --> 01:13:44,703
Help put the explosives

1366
01:13:45,727 --> 01:13:46,239
That's what he said

1367
01:13:46,495 --> 01:13:50,079
That

1368
01:13:50,591 --> 01:13:52,895
Saudi Arabia was working with the government

1369
01:13:53,151 --> 01:13:53,663
If it

1370
01:13:53,919 --> 01:13:56,735
Saudi Arabia was also part of the plot

1371
01:13:56,991 --> 01:13:57,759
To put explosive

1372
01:13:58,015 --> 01:13:59,807
I thought it was Bush's idea

1373
01:14:02,367 --> 01:14:05,695
John P O'Neill is a guy who was a counterterrorism expert

1374
01:14:06,207 --> 01:14:09,279
And he was in line for some

1375
01:14:09,535 --> 01:14:10,559
Some jobs

1376
01:14:11,071 --> 01:14:17,215
In the early 2001 he was recommended to be the national coordinator for security infrastructure protection account

1377
01:14:17,471 --> 01:14:17,983
Terrorism

1378
01:14:18,495 --> 01:14:19,775
After Richard A Clark

1379
01:14:20,031 --> 01:14:23,871
I was going to move on and he recommended John P O'Neill to that position

1380
01:14:24,127 --> 01:14:25,407
John.

1381
01:14:25,663 --> 01:14:27,711
Because the salary wasn't to his liking

1382
01:14:27,967 --> 01:14:30,783
Bobcat around the same time it became

1383
01:14:32,831 --> 01:14:38,975
We became known that the New York Times head on him about how a little

1384
01:14:39,231 --> 01:14:44,095
Glover year earlier he had a briefcase stolen and caused 911 know

1385
01:14:44,351 --> 01:14:48,959
Include like classified documents and stuff like that

1386
01:14:49,215 --> 01:14:52,031
And what appears to be is that like he just

1387
01:14:52,287 --> 01:14:53,823
He was a victim of theft

1388
01:14:54,079 --> 01:14:54,847
But

1389
01:14:55,103 --> 01:14:56,639
The story doesn't look good in terms

1390
01:14:56,895 --> 01:14:57,663
The View keeping

1391
01:14:57,919 --> 01:14:59,455
Record

1392
01:14:59,711 --> 01:15:04,575
And India border line classified

1393
01:15:06,879 --> 01:15:08,415
It may be we don't trust you anymore

1394
01:15:08,671 --> 01:15:13,791
In the Fallout of the story was going to come out he decided to retire

1395
01:15:14,047 --> 01:15:15,327
And take a lucrative position

1396
01:15:15,839 --> 01:15:18,655
It may or may not have been hooked up

1397
01:15:18,911 --> 01:15:20,447
For him by Rudy Giuliani

1398
01:15:20,959 --> 01:15:26,847
Security

1399
01:15:27,103 --> 01:15:31,199
He became head of security at the World Trade Center on August 23rd 2001

1400
01:15:31,711 --> 01:15:34,015
The salary is like $300,000

1401
01:15:35,039 --> 01:15:37,343
That was the

1402
01:15:37,599 --> 01:15:42,719
That's what he thought is like what I've done with the counterterrorism

1403
01:15:42,975 --> 01:15:45,279
I'm here then course 9/11 happened then he died and

1404
01:15:47,071 --> 01:15:48,095
But ivy

1405
01:15:48,351 --> 01:15:49,375
The conspiracy world

1406
01:15:49,631 --> 01:15:50,399
Is weaved all kinds of

1407
01:15:50,655 --> 01:15:52,703
Compelling narratives about I

1408
01:15:52,959 --> 01:15:54,495
Because he did

1409
01:15:54,751 --> 01:15:58,079
He did research the initial 1993 bombing

1410
01:15:58,591 --> 01:16:01,919
Of the World Trade Center

1411
01:16:02,431 --> 01:16:04,735
But he he was someone who did

1412
01:16:04,991 --> 01:16:07,551
Have expertise to a certain extent

1413
01:16:07,807 --> 01:16:11,135
He was the inside man who knew how to blow up the

1414
01:16:11,391 --> 01:16:11,903
World Trade

1415
01:16:12,159 --> 01:16:12,671
No

1416
01:16:12,927 --> 01:16:17,791
What was the guy who wasn't on board

1417
01:16:18,047 --> 01:16:19,583
And so they put him in the tower

1418
01:16:20,095 --> 01:16:22,143
What doesn't make sense you work there for a month

1419
01:16:22,399 --> 01:16:28,287
But you three weeks before then why would he go to work

1420
01:16:28,543 --> 01:16:33,407
But it's not as big as not that it's not

1421
01:16:34,175 --> 01:16:35,199
Is Bruce Edward

1422
01:16:35,455 --> 01:16:35,967
Ivan's

1423
01:16:36,991 --> 01:16:38,271
Bruce Edwards Ivan

1424
01:16:38,783 --> 01:16:40,319
Is actually Robert Mueller

1425
01:16:40,575 --> 01:16:42,367
Do you know who that is at all

1426
01:16:44,671 --> 01:16:47,999
He's the guy who was the anthrax Mailer in 2001

1427
01:16:49,535 --> 01:16:55,679
What's a week after 9/11 a bunch of people including Tom Brokaw Salzburg castle and Patrick Lake

1428
01:16:55,935 --> 01:16:58,495
Remember they got letters that had Anthrax spores in them

1429
01:17:00,031 --> 01:17:02,335
It is the Department of Justice

1430
01:17:02,847 --> 01:17:03,359
But I

1431
01:17:03,871 --> 01:17:05,407
Long 90-page

1432
01:17:05,663 --> 01:17:06,431
Document

1433
01:17:06,687 --> 01:17:07,967
Explain why him

1434
01:17:08,991 --> 01:17:09,759
Boy it's

1435
01:17:10,015 --> 01:17:15,391
Compare it with him it's convinced it's probably about this

1436
01:17:15,647 --> 01:17:16,415
The anthrax

1437
01:17:16,671 --> 01:17:18,975
Mahler killed five people and injured 17

1438
01:17:19,231 --> 01:17:22,559
Can't pay that started a week after 9/11 ended

1439
01:17:22,815 --> 01:17:24,095
Couple months later

1440
01:17:24,607 --> 01:17:28,959
Some of the notes that were sent that had Anthrax in them

1441
01:17:29,215 --> 01:17:30,239
Tom Brokaw said

1442
01:17:30,495 --> 01:17:31,519
In all capital letters

1443
01:17:31,775 --> 01:17:32,799
This is next

1444
01:17:33,055 --> 01:17:34,079
You always know it's important

1445
01:17:34,591 --> 01:17:35,359
What are you got all cap

1446
01:17:35,615 --> 01:17:36,639
This is next

1447
01:17:36,895 --> 01:17:41,247
Take penicillin now death to America death to Israel Allah is great

1448
01:17:42,271 --> 01:17:45,599
Emma letters that you sent to Tom daschle and Patrick Leahy they said

1449
01:17:45,855 --> 01:17:47,135
You cannot stop us

1450
01:17:47,391 --> 01:17:48,415
We have a ax

1451
01:17:48,671 --> 01:17:53,279
You die now are you afraid death to America Desta Israel Allah is great

1452
01:17:54,047 --> 01:17:55,327
So initially

1453
01:17:55,583 --> 01:18:01,727
Bruce Edwards Ivins was involved in the investigation because he was one of the world's foremost experts on cultivating and produce

1454
01:18:01,983 --> 01:18:03,007
Using anthrax

1455
01:18:03,263 --> 01:18:04,799
He actually was

1456
01:18:05,055 --> 01:18:05,567
He was

1457
01:18:05,823 --> 01:18:08,639
Brought in to investigate the letters of anthrax

1458
01:18:09,151 --> 01:18:09,663
Then he said

1459
01:18:12,223 --> 01:18:16,063
Dexter s*** right there since Vic

1460
01:18:16,319 --> 01:18:17,599
He had did he had done it

1461
01:18:17,855 --> 01:18:23,999
Well it seems like now it's an obvious ticket retrospect wait wait

1462
01:18:24,255 --> 01:18:30,143
In a way such that he was and that would kill his other people in the lab

1463
01:18:30,399 --> 01:18:36,543
Using using and there's other people in the lab there's a lot there there's a certain amount of plausible deniability that got

1464
01:18:36,799 --> 01:18:38,847
Worn-down much like an old brake pad

1465
01:18:39,103 --> 01:18:42,175
To the point where eventually in 2008

1466
01:18:42,431 --> 01:18:48,575
He couldn't keep up the ruse anymore and that's what I'm done blowing up in his face but there was enough

1467
01:18:48,831 --> 01:18:50,623
Committed suicide

1468
01:18:50,879 --> 01:18:56,511
I'll explain why

1469
01:18:57,023 --> 01:18:59,583
So he was a senior researcher in bio-defense

1470
01:18:59,839 --> 01:19:00,607
Fort Detrick

1471
01:19:00,863 --> 01:19:02,911
The US Army medical research has

1472
01:19:03,167 --> 01:19:06,495
Sudan infectious disease what I always say is the best biodefense

1473
01:19:06,751 --> 01:19:07,519
Is the Best Buy Owasso

1474
01:19:07,775 --> 01:19:08,543
There's no doubt about it

1475
01:19:08,799 --> 01:19:14,943
At the time in four years the FBI's investigation focused on Stephen Hatfield another researcher at USAA

1476
01:19:15,199 --> 01:19:15,967
Mrid

1477
01:19:16,479 --> 01:19:18,271
Who they have decided with a good stuff

1478
01:19:18,783 --> 01:19:22,111
The FBI surveilled him and raided his home in hazmat suits multiple times

1479
01:19:22,623 --> 01:19:28,767
Do the whole 9 yd investigation after years of coming up with nothing solid Hatchell was exonerated and he sued the government

1480
01:19:29,279 --> 01:19:33,631
The case was settled in 2008 with Hatfield being awarded 4.6 $1000000

1481
01:19:34,143 --> 01:19:37,983
Etihad Bruce Edward Ivins right next to him and he was wearing a shirt that said

1482
01:19:41,055 --> 01:19:47,199
The murderer in 2008 exonerated Ivan started demonstrating some erratic

1483
01:19:47,455 --> 01:19:48,223
Suspicious Behavior

1484
01:19:48,991 --> 01:19:50,015
On March 28th

1485
01:19:50,271 --> 01:19:53,599
2008 police were dispatched to Ivans home where they found him unconscious

1486
01:19:54,111 --> 01:19:54,879
And took him to the hospital

1487
01:19:55,647 --> 01:20:01,791
In June of that year he was involuntarily committed to a psychiatric hospital haven't showed a pattern of suicidal ideation

1488
01:20:02,303 --> 01:20:05,631
In July it was informed that he would be prosecuted for the anthrax attack

1489
01:20:05,887 --> 01:20:07,935
And according to his report

1490
01:20:08,191 --> 01:20:08,703
No one

1491
01:20:08,959 --> 01:20:14,080
I couldn't find this from any government Source but he had told other people that he was facing the death by

1492
01:20:14,336 --> 01:20:14,848
Penalty for it

1493
01:20:17,664 --> 01:20:23,296
In July to July 29th you found unconscious in his home haven't taken two bottles of Tylenol PM

1494
01:20:23,552 --> 01:20:24,576
Which they have receipts

1495
01:20:24,832 --> 01:20:25,856
Swore that he had bought

1496
01:20:26,112 --> 01:20:27,392
Bright before

1497
01:20:27,648 --> 01:20:32,000
Are you taken to the hospital where he would die from liver and kidney failure before it's after

1498
01:20:32,256 --> 01:20:34,048
His family decided not to put him on a train

1499
01:20:35,072 --> 01:20:36,096
The family decided

1500
01:20:36,608 --> 01:20:38,656
Amtrak murderer

1501
01:20:41,984 --> 01:20:42,496
Go to be honest

1502
01:20:43,264 --> 01:20:45,824
Two bottles of Tylenol PM murder

1503
01:20:46,336 --> 01:20:52,480
Aw

1504
01:20:52,736 --> 01:20:57,856
Bottle of Tylenol PM never went into the equation throwing up man

1505
01:20:58,112 --> 01:21:02,720
You good at that too many will die from liver and kidney failure

1506
01:21:02,976 --> 01:21:04,000
Then that's what it is

1507
01:21:04,256 --> 01:21:10,144
Quick enough right but there is forever odds of it being successful or better

1508
01:21:10,656 --> 01:21:11,936
Let's read a lot of other

1509
01:21:12,192 --> 01:21:13,216
Methods other than like

1510
01:21:13,472 --> 01:21:14,496
Straight up gun to the Head

1511
01:21:14,752 --> 01:21:17,824
You know what he's probably researched it more than I did probably

1512
01:21:22,944 --> 01:21:23,456
For God's sake

1513
01:21:23,712 --> 01:21:29,856
Professor

1514
01:21:30,112 --> 01:21:33,184
Drift Away

1515
01:21:33,440 --> 01:21:34,720
Really convincing

1516
01:21:34,976 --> 01:21:39,584
So I took all of this from the Department of Justice report you can find it it's online

1517
01:21:39,840 --> 01:21:44,448
The spores that were sent in the mail were of a strain called RMR 1029

1518
01:21:44,704 --> 01:21:50,848
Do the frame that he wasn't exclusive control over in his usamriid

1519
01:21:51,104 --> 01:21:54,688
Other people

1520
01:21:54,944 --> 01:21:57,760
Our people had access to it

1521
01:21:58,016 --> 01:21:59,808
Haha

1522
01:22:00,320 --> 01:22:03,648
They have all been excluded

1523
01:22:03,904 --> 01:22:05,440
Many of the people interviewed were like

1524
01:22:05,696 --> 01:22:08,000
There's no way we could have gotten access to it without him

1525
01:22:08,256 --> 01:22:09,792
By being involved

1526
01:22:10,304 --> 01:22:13,376
Not even more damning in the months where the mailings were happening

1527
01:22:13,632 --> 01:22:16,704
Ivan started to work suspiciously high amount of overtime

1528
01:22:17,216 --> 01:22:19,520
Specifically in time but he'll be alone in the lab

1529
01:22:19,776 --> 01:22:25,920
From January 2001 to July 2001 he worked a total of 8 hours and 48 minutes in the lab after hour

1530
01:22:26,688 --> 01:22:28,224
On August in August

1531
01:22:28,480 --> 01:22:30,016
York 11 hours and 15 minutes

1532
01:22:30,528 --> 01:22:33,088
In September 31 hours and 28 minutes

1533
01:22:33,344 --> 01:22:38,976
16 hours and 13 minutes 6 hours and 20

1534
01:22:39,488 --> 01:22:40,512
The pattern is of

1535
01:22:40,768 --> 01:22:43,584
Increase time alone in the lab when the attack were happening

1536
01:22:43,840 --> 01:22:45,632
Dental scaling back to normal after

1537
01:22:45,888 --> 01:22:50,240
Now keep in mind you would have had to sign into the lab there electronic

1538
01:22:50,496 --> 01:22:52,032
Access

1539
01:22:52,288 --> 01:22:53,824
Stamps of when he was in there

1540
01:22:54,080 --> 01:22:56,640
Hate to get into a lab that's dealing with anthrax

1541
01:22:56,896 --> 01:23:03,040
You have to take off your clothes and put on a special suit to go inside rather than afterwards take a shower and get into your

1542
01:23:03,296 --> 01:23:04,320
Normal clothes

1543
01:23:04,576 --> 01:23:07,392
Cumbersome Affair after hours

1544
01:23:07,648 --> 01:23:08,672
Is insane

1545
01:23:09,184 --> 01:23:12,768
Ivan said no explanation for why he was working so much after hours

1546
01:23:13,024 --> 01:23:18,144
There was no special project that there's no special project happening that could explain it

1547
01:23:18,400 --> 01:23:19,168
He was just

1548
01:23:23,264 --> 01:23:27,360
Is that in order to make Anthrax usable it has to be dry

1549
01:23:31,200 --> 01:23:37,344
This is from the doj report as one of the problems with such a complicated way of murdering people

1550
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:38,880
People that limit the suspect

1551
01:23:42,208 --> 01:23:44,512
You and like eight other guys

1552
01:23:44,768 --> 01:23:50,912
From the doj report spores likely would have attracted attention unless the perpetrator a access the equipment

1553
01:23:51,168 --> 01:23:51,680
At night

1554
01:23:51,936 --> 01:23:58,080
Anthrax spores requires either a sophisticated drying machine call Delilah Pfizer

1555
01:23:58,336 --> 01:24:04,480
Zach or a great deal of time and Faith to let the spores airdrop to allow the water to evaporate in the leg

1556
01:24:05,248 --> 01:24:08,832
Because drying Anthrax is expressly forbidden by various treaties

1557
01:24:09,088 --> 01:24:15,232
Overuse of overuse of any of these methods if noticed would raise considerable alarm and security

1558
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:22,144
Of course you have to do it after hours and guess what they happen to have a Lyle phaser the equipment that you

1559
01:24:22,400 --> 01:24:28,288
You need to dry and 4x at that lab it was requisitioned by Ivan in the paperwork says

1560
01:24:28,544 --> 01:24:31,104
Property of Bruce

1561
01:24:31,872 --> 01:24:38,016
But such a dude waiting like it's that old joke about men always

1562
01:24:38,272 --> 01:24:44,416
Cheating on their spouses with like the girl next door like on the road cuz they're not stupid

1563
01:24:44,928 --> 01:24:51,072
Like he was like it well I want to murder a lot of people but I also want to make sure it's the only person that you can look

1564
01:24:51,328 --> 01:24:55,424
To go get to have you tried to throw people off the trail later

1565
01:24:55,936 --> 01:25:02,080
So it's believed that his motive as funding and approval for his wife's work that is complicated

1566
01:25:02,336 --> 01:25:07,712
And then scare children away from his lab females got left behind today

1567
01:25:07,968 --> 01:25:10,784
His life's work was the development of an Anthrax attack

1568
01:25:11,296 --> 01:25:17,440
And just funding and approval for this was in Jeopardy at the only exactly

1569
01:25:17,696 --> 01:25:20,256
Origin story

1570
01:25:20,512 --> 01:25:26,656
The only way to change things

1571
01:25:26,912 --> 01:25:28,192
Nothing to scare people about anthrax

1572
01:25:28,704 --> 01:25:32,032
Interesting late this is exactly what happened after the anthrax attacks

1573
01:25:32,288 --> 01:25:35,104
They got approval and funding

1574
01:25:37,152 --> 01:25:39,200
This is a Spider-Man villain

1575
01:25:39,456 --> 01:25:41,760
But he's also a lunatic

1576
01:25:43,552 --> 01:25:44,320
Obviously

1577
01:25:44,576 --> 01:25:50,720
So I become 98% anthrax

1578
01:25:50,976 --> 01:25:53,024
Terrorist and in the vein

1579
01:25:53,792 --> 01:25:57,376
There's a very strong history of

1580
01:25:58,144 --> 01:26:00,960
Not too much domestic violence in this case but domestic

1581
01:26:01,472 --> 01:26:02,240
Harassment

1582
01:26:02,496 --> 01:26:03,008
Okay

1583
01:26:03,264 --> 01:26:05,568
So Ivan was obsessed with two female college

1584
01:26:05,824 --> 01:26:08,640
At the point when this report was written

1585
01:26:08,896 --> 01:26:10,176
Two former colleagues

1586
01:26:10,688 --> 01:26:16,064
Leading up to the anthrax attacks you sent two of them disturbing emails about his mental health struggles

1587
01:26:16,576 --> 01:26:19,648
He admitted to stealing one of their email passwords and reading their emails

1588
01:26:20,160 --> 01:26:20,928
He also said

1589
01:26:22,464 --> 01:26:23,744
Wants to get caught

1590
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:28,352
He also sent this poem that appears to be an admission of schizophrenic Tendencies 21

1591
01:26:29,120 --> 01:26:30,656
I'm going to read this poem to you

1592
01:26:31,168 --> 01:26:35,008
I made up some poems about having two people in one me and the person in my dream

1593
01:26:35,520 --> 01:26:36,032
Hazleton

1594
01:26:36,544 --> 01:26:40,640
That's not a good time for your phone I'm a Little Dream self short and stout

1595
01:26:40,896 --> 01:26:44,992
That's also not a good start for your Paula he lets me out

1596
01:26:45,248 --> 01:26:49,856
When I get all steamed up I don't pout I push Bruce aside that I'm free to run about

1597
01:26:50,112 --> 01:26:53,696
Hickory Dickory Dock Bruce. Bruce ran up the clock

1598
01:26:53,952 --> 01:26:58,816
But something happened did a very strange Rhythm his other self went to exchange places with him

1599
01:26:59,072 --> 01:27:02,144
So now please guess who is conversing with you

1600
01:27:02,400 --> 01:27:03,680
Hickory Dickory Dock

1601
01:27:03,936 --> 01:27:06,496
Bruce in this other guy sitting by some trees

1602
01:27:06,752 --> 01:27:08,032
Exchanging personalities

1603
01:27:08,288 --> 01:27:09,824
It's like having two in one

1604
01:27:10,080 --> 01:27:11,360
Actually it's rather fun

1605
01:27:11,616 --> 01:27:12,384
!

1606
01:27:14,432 --> 01:27:15,456
Well that was the worst

1607
01:27:15,712 --> 01:27:17,504
B Andrew Dice ever did

1608
01:27:17,760 --> 01:27:19,808
That was the worst the clay is ever done

1609
01:27:20,320 --> 01:27:26,464
So he's sending all these harassing really kind of scary emails and there's a lot there's a lot

1610
01:27:26,720 --> 01:27:31,840
There's a lot more we trying to play the two against each other and like

1611
01:27:32,096 --> 01:27:36,448
Telling them that they're the only people who really know him there's like it's really f***** up stuff

1612
01:27:36,704 --> 01:27:37,984
Also

1613
01:27:38,240 --> 01:27:40,544
When he was hospitalized I ended up in group therapy

1614
01:27:40,800 --> 01:27:45,152
And in that time he said some really f***** up things ranging from threat

1615
01:27:45,408 --> 01:27:47,456
Two other people to basic admissions of guilt

1616
01:27:47,712 --> 01:27:53,856
For I haven't gotten the address mailing

1617
01:27:54,112 --> 01:27:55,136
With the rest of the group

1618
01:27:55,648 --> 01:27:59,232
Not until I Anthrax all of you

1619
01:27:59,488 --> 01:28:01,280
Visiting from the doj report

1620
01:28:01,536 --> 01:28:05,120
As described in detail in the mental health section Supra Etta group

1621
01:28:05,376 --> 01:28:11,520
Therapy session in July 9th 2008 statements regarding the anthrax investigation

1622
01:28:11,776 --> 01:28:13,056
Detailed plan

1623
01:28:13,312 --> 01:28:16,128
Involving a gun from his son at a bulletproof vest

1624
01:28:16,384 --> 01:28:16,896
Kill quote

1625
01:28:17,152 --> 01:28:18,944
Co-workers and others who had wronged

1626
01:28:19,712 --> 01:28:24,064
What other members of the group was what he was concerned about if he was innocent

1627
01:28:24,320 --> 01:28:25,600
He reportedly just smiled

1628
01:28:26,368 --> 01:28:28,928
Statements that he made also indicated that he had lost

1629
01:28:29,184 --> 01:28:29,952
Time

1630
01:28:30,208 --> 01:28:33,792
The only reason I remember some of this stuff it's because there's like a clue the neck

1631
01:28:34,048 --> 01:28:38,400
Today like there's an email or you know when you're when you're in bed and you're like

1632
01:28:38,656 --> 01:28:40,192
You're like this you know that's

1633
01:28:40,448 --> 01:28:44,288
That's not really fun it's like oh s*** did I drive somewhere last night

1634
01:28:45,056 --> 01:28:49,152
She has a bunch of things about waking up in his clothes

1635
01:28:49,664 --> 01:28:52,992
But not knowing what he did the night before 6

1636
01:28:53,504 --> 01:28:54,272
So cute

1637
01:28:54,528 --> 01:28:57,600
Just really f***** up high intelligence do

1638
01:28:58,112 --> 01:29:00,416
If there's a part of me that now is like I

1639
01:29:01,184 --> 01:29:04,768
Baby if you work was Anthrax everyday of your life your

1640
01:29:05,024 --> 01:29:06,304
Your brains going to go f*****-up

1641
01:29:06,560 --> 01:29:08,864
The rest of the people in his life

1642
01:29:09,376 --> 01:29:15,520
That's a good point nevermind so although he was working overtime and they were

1643
01:29:15,776 --> 01:29:17,056
Weren't though

1644
01:29:17,312 --> 01:29:23,456
He was murdering people concurrently yes in November 2017 sent himself along 12.9

1645
01:29:23,712 --> 01:29:29,856
Milo trying to craft an explanation for how the two former female co-workers he was obsessed with we're probably the ones who did the a

1646
01:29:30,112 --> 01:29:30,624
Direct attack

1647
01:29:30,880 --> 01:29:31,904
Hey Bruce

1648
01:29:32,160 --> 01:29:32,672
April

1649
01:29:32,928 --> 01:29:33,440
How you been

1650
01:29:33,696 --> 01:29:34,464
It's good to talk to you

1651
01:29:37,024 --> 01:29:40,352
So they had said stop working with him and he felt that abandoned

1652
01:29:40,864 --> 01:29:42,912
Went with Hatfield being cleared of charges

1653
01:29:43,168 --> 01:29:46,752
You knew you needed to shift the narrative it makes someone else look suspicious to keep eyes off him

1654
01:29:47,264 --> 01:29:47,776
Add to complete

1655
01:29:48,288 --> 01:29:49,312
Did you read those 12 points

1656
01:29:49,568 --> 01:29:50,080
They do not amount

1657
01:29:51,104 --> 01:29:51,872
Finally

1658
01:29:52,896 --> 01:29:56,736
Bruce Ivins had a rich tradition of taking on aliases to send people things through the mail

1659
01:29:59,296 --> 01:30:04,672
That's the winner right there his female co-workers a package ostensibly from Mia Hamm

1660
01:30:04,928 --> 01:30:07,744
Which contained a soccer jersey

1661
01:30:09,536 --> 01:30:10,816
He also

1662
01:30:11,072 --> 01:30:12,096
Set one of them

1663
01:30:12,864 --> 01:30:13,632
Gabriella's

1664
01:30:13,888 --> 01:30:16,448
Shoot your shot dude

1665
01:30:16,960 --> 01:30:19,520
At least ghost

1666
01:30:26,432 --> 01:30:28,224
Lovett they also sent one of them boxes

1667
01:30:28,480 --> 01:30:31,552
The Yankees memorabilia and a package marked from Derek Jeter

1668
01:30:32,064 --> 01:30:38,208
So alright alright alright cuz it's going on this guy I mean

1669
01:30:38,464 --> 01:30:44,608
Women's forces while this is a Title Nine supporter my friend if you look at the big picture when you come away with very clearly is

1670
01:30:44,864 --> 01:30:47,424
A guy who committed suicide because the jig was up

1671
01:30:48,704 --> 01:30:51,520
He was a tortured mentally ill person and that

1672
01:30:51,776 --> 01:30:55,872
There's a tragedy there but you know you crossed the border line and you start sending

1673
01:30:56,128 --> 01:30:57,408
News organizations and

1674
01:30:57,664 --> 01:30:58,944
Politicians Amtrak

1675
01:30:59,200 --> 01:31:02,272
Kind of

1676
01:31:02,528 --> 01:31:05,600
They are you kind of cross the Rubicon at work

1677
01:31:07,904 --> 01:31:09,184
First of all did 9/11

1678
01:31:09,440 --> 01:31:13,792
I killed John P I P O'Neill

1679
01:31:14,048 --> 01:31:14,816
Bruce Ivins

1680
01:31:15,072 --> 01:31:18,144
In order to cover up that he was the one who did all the answer

1681
01:31:18,656 --> 01:31:19,680
All of it is

1682
01:31:19,936 --> 01:31:20,448
Bulshit

1683
01:31:20,960 --> 01:31:21,472
Oh yeah

1684
01:31:21,984 --> 01:31:22,752
Such b*******

1685
01:31:23,008 --> 01:31:26,080
This is exactly like when we were talking about the madam

1686
01:31:26,336 --> 01:31:29,408
All those people that Alex said were murdered

1687
01:31:29,664 --> 01:31:32,736
In the episode we did about Andrew Breitbart is all just like

1688
01:31:32,992 --> 01:31:36,064
And he's just hoping that no one actually reads stuff and be like

1689
01:31:37,088 --> 01:31:40,416
Focus

1690
01:31:41,184 --> 01:31:42,720
It is really about how Hillary is ugly

1691
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:45,280
And a Hilary thumbscrew

1692
01:31:46,560 --> 01:31:48,608
You are so demonically ugly

1693
01:31:48,864 --> 01:31:49,888
You're so twisted

1694
01:31:50,400 --> 01:31:51,168
You are such a

1695
01:31:51,424 --> 01:31:53,216
Picture of a witch

1696
01:31:53,728 --> 01:31:59,872
Praise for God's justice to come down on Mueller

1697
01:32:00,128 --> 01:32:01,408
And what have you or whatever

1698
01:32:01,664 --> 01:32:07,808
Alex says something a Time

1699
01:32:08,064 --> 01:32:09,344
Long enough to have committed all the crimes

1700
01:32:09,600 --> 01:32:10,880
I'm fine with that whatever

1701
01:32:11,136 --> 01:32:13,696
Galaxy something I'm pretty excited about

1702
01:32:14,976 --> 01:32:15,488
And so

1703
01:32:19,840 --> 01:32:20,352
I'm all in

1704
01:32:20,864 --> 01:32:21,376
I think

1705
01:32:21,632 --> 01:32:27,776
But that is an announcement that Alex Jones is going to be wrestling at the bullet Club in Chicago

1706
01:32:28,032 --> 01:32:34,176
Alex is all very excited this card is stacked

1707
01:32:34,432 --> 01:32:35,200
Rey Mysterio

1708
01:32:35,456 --> 01:32:41,600
Oh my God what a man I don't think you will

1709
01:32:41,856 --> 01:32:46,464
I don't think it's going to happen I don't think I'd like to see Alex get super kick

1710
01:32:46,720 --> 01:32:47,232
I would

1711
01:32:50,816 --> 01:32:53,120
How to spell eyeball

1712
01:32:56,704 --> 01:32:57,472
I just trust God

1713
01:32:58,240 --> 01:32:59,520
I'm almost guilty

1714
01:33:01,312 --> 01:33:02,080
I don't even pray to God

1715
01:33:05,408 --> 01:33:06,176
Kids are on drugs

1716
01:33:08,992 --> 01:33:09,760
He's all in

1717
01:33:11,296 --> 01:33:13,600
There's no

1718
01:33:13,856 --> 01:33:19,744
Call Ann

1719
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:23,072
Jesus Christ

1720
01:33:25,376 --> 01:33:26,656
And you know that's why Hillary

1721
01:33:28,192 --> 01:33:30,496
Alex Jones vs Rey Mysterio in a Soros

1722
01:33:30,752 --> 01:33:32,032
Alright alright

1723
01:33:32,544 --> 01:33:33,056
Because folks

1724
01:33:33,824 --> 01:33:34,336
Slump God

1725
01:33:36,128 --> 01:33:37,152
Don't think you do

1726
01:33:37,408 --> 01:33:38,176
Little puppy

1727
01:33:39,200 --> 01:33:40,736
Except not

1728
01:33:41,504 --> 01:33:42,016
Stars

1729
01:33:42,784 --> 01:33:43,296
I love happy

1730
01:33:44,064 --> 01:33:44,832
And that's why I walk

1731
01:33:46,112 --> 01:33:46,624
Watch a bunch of

1732
01:33:46,880 --> 01:33:47,648
Murderous monster

1733
01:33:49,952 --> 01:33:50,976
Shifter

1734
01:33:51,744 --> 01:33:52,512
Watch the Earth

1735
01:33:56,864 --> 01:33:59,424
Get back to the stars at night Europe

1736
01:33:59,936 --> 01:34:00,960
Alright cellular

1737
01:34:01,216 --> 01:34:01,728
Scared about

1738
01:34:05,568 --> 01:34:06,080
Tottenham

1739
01:34:06,336 --> 01:34:07,616
I love the stars at night

1740
01:34:07,872 --> 01:34:09,664
I'm like I'm like you human

1741
01:34:09,920 --> 01:34:12,736
Human level

1742
01:34:13,248 --> 01:34:13,760
I take

1743
01:34:14,016 --> 01:34:14,784
I take her leave

1744
01:34:15,040 --> 01:34:16,832
The stars at night whatever

1745
01:34:17,088 --> 01:34:17,856
I've seen Stars

1746
01:34:18,880 --> 01:34:24,512
So I mean you know Alex is always in whatever

1747
01:34:24,768 --> 01:34:25,792
Episode

1748
01:34:26,048 --> 01:34:26,816
Are you saying nothing

1749
01:34:27,584 --> 01:34:32,192
Because all stuff you said before like I will go to The Bitter End by whatever

1750
01:34:32,704 --> 01:34:38,848
But in this next clip we get to what my theory that I was saying before that I think Alex gives an indication in this Mexico

1751
01:34:39,360 --> 01:34:40,640
But he's getting ready to

1752
01:34:40,896 --> 01:34:42,432
Completely change himself

1753
01:34:43,968 --> 01:34:44,480
I'm damn proud

1754
01:34:47,296 --> 01:34:47,808
Rihanna

1755
01:34:49,088 --> 01:34:49,600
I'm willing to

1756
01:34:49,856 --> 01:34:51,136
Whatever Lexi

1757
01:34:54,976 --> 01:34:56,256
Electroshock

1758
01:34:57,024 --> 01:34:57,536
Romeo

1759
01:34:57,792 --> 01:34:58,816
Gibbering idiot

1760
01:35:00,352 --> 01:35:01,376
I think that's preemptive

1761
01:35:02,656 --> 01:35:05,984
I don't think he's going to come out like sucking McMurtry

1762
01:35:06,240 --> 01:35:12,384
And One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest

1763
01:35:12,640 --> 01:35:13,408
Packages himself

1764
01:35:13,664 --> 01:35:15,200
Again much like pro wrestling

1765
01:35:15,456 --> 01:35:16,992
I shift the narratives

1766
01:35:17,248 --> 01:35:18,016
Or whatever

1767
01:35:18,272 --> 01:35:19,552
He convened be like

1768
01:35:21,088 --> 01:35:22,624
You can salvage something

1769
01:35:22,880 --> 01:35:24,416
People will forget this

1770
01:35:26,464 --> 01:35:30,304
I'm just imagining robbed his nurse ratchet wearing that

1771
01:35:30,560 --> 01:35:31,328
That nurse

1772
01:35:31,840 --> 01:35:33,376
I can see that that's all I can think of right now

1773
01:35:33,632 --> 01:35:35,424
Siri stupid

1774
01:35:35,936 --> 01:35:38,496
Define something

1775
01:35:38,752 --> 01:35:42,336
That's a weird better dialogue that's a weird piece of rhetoric

1776
01:35:42,848 --> 01:35:44,128
I think

1777
01:35:44,384 --> 01:35:47,200
This idea of like if I Trot out and I'm completely different

1778
01:35:51,296 --> 01:35:53,344
Don't let them ever demoralize you

1779
01:35:55,648 --> 01:35:56,160
Liar

1780
01:35:56,416 --> 01:35:57,696
I'm not real I'm an actor

1781
01:35:59,744 --> 01:36:03,328
Your lawyer Robert Mueller

1782
01:36:05,376 --> 01:36:06,912
What state

1783
01:36:07,680 --> 01:36:10,496
So he's ahead of the deep State now

1784
01:36:10,752 --> 01:36:11,264
Bright

1785
01:36:11,520 --> 01:36:17,664
Alex like don't let anyone ever tell you that I turned my back on you if I come out

1786
01:36:18,944 --> 01:36:21,248
Right in some way his

1787
01:36:21,504 --> 01:36:22,016
30

1788
01:36:22,272 --> 01:36:24,320
Launching a possibility for him to like

1789
01:36:24,576 --> 01:36:28,672
Get a job at Fox News or something like that

1790
01:36:28,928 --> 01:36:32,000
But I Justified floating it as a possibility

1791
01:36:32,512 --> 01:36:37,120
Something to keep me interested in this Saturday is just a mess

1792
01:36:37,888 --> 01:36:38,912
Lady that maybe you like

1793
01:36:39,680 --> 01:36:40,192

Foreshadowing

1795
01:36:43,776 --> 01:36:47,104
Microphone

1796
01:36:48,640 --> 01:36:49,408
It was okay

1797
01:36:49,664 --> 01:36:50,176
What

1798
01:36:50,944 --> 01:36:52,736
Andrew Soros

1799
01:36:53,760 --> 01:36:54,272
Bruce Ohr

1800
01:36:57,600 --> 01:36:58,112
Except

You know what

1806
01:37:06,560 --> 01:37:08,608
You are going to be destroyed

1807
01:37:09,120 --> 01:37:09,632
Your crimes

1808
01:37:10,912 --> 01:37:12,704
You have gone across that line

1809
01:37:13,472 --> 01:37:15,008
You have crossed that Rubicon

1810
01:37:16,032 --> 01:37:16,544
UF

1811
01:37:16,800 --> 01:37:17,312

Did your old man now

1814
01:37:34,720 --> 01:37:35,744
When you die

1815
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:37,280
Your family buries you

1816
01:37:38,816 --> 01:37:39,328
Failure

1817

Anime

1819
01:37:45,984 --> 01:37:46,752
If I was you

1820
01:37:47,776 --> 01:37:48,544
I'd be getting you

1821
01:37:48,800 --> 01:37:49,312

01:37:54,688 --> 01:37:55,200
Percent

1824

1828
01:38:06,464 --> 01:38:12,352
What's that subliminal

1829
01:38:12,608 --> 01:38:16,960
You die without honor I believe

1830
01:38:17,728 --> 01:38:18,752
I mean this is

1831
01:38:19,008 --> 01:38:19,776
By the way

1832
01:38:20,032 --> 01:38:20,544
I don't know

1833
01:38:20,800 --> 01:38:22,080
You've ever read the Bible Alex

1834
01:38:22,336 --> 01:38:25,920
But too late for you to accept Christ is very much

1835
01:38:26,432 --> 01:38:27,456
Not what Christ said

1836
01:38:27,968 --> 01:38:33,856
Christ was very much on the side of like it's never too late for that guy who I was

1837
01:38:34,112 --> 01:38:37,952
Committed all of the worst crimes and I was like

1838
01:38:38,208 --> 01:38:43,072
You're cool dude remember how it wasn't too late for that f****** guy guess what

1839
01:38:43,328 --> 01:38:47,680
That's my whole gig

1840
01:38:47,936 --> 01:38:49,728
Yeah but the Alex does Italy say I do

1841
01:38:49,984 --> 01:38:50,496
I don't know if you gone

1842
01:38:57,408 --> 01:39:00,480
But that doesn't apply to the physical diagrams to like

1843
01:39:05,088 --> 01:39:10,464
Robert Mueller did 9/11

1844
01:39:10,720 --> 01:39:12,256
Uno's

1845
01:39:12,512 --> 01:39:15,328
Alex accuses about something else here this next clip

1846
01:39:15,584 --> 01:39:16,608
And then the end of this

1847
01:39:16,864 --> 01:39:19,680
Is pretty why you did 9/11

1848
01:39:20,192 --> 01:39:21,216
Your grandma live

1849
01:39:21,984 --> 01:39:22,496
Explosive

1850
01:39:28,128 --> 01:39:29,152
Peligro Matt Daley.

1851
01:39:31,200 --> 01:39:32,736
Oklahoma City

1852
01:39:35,296 --> 01:39:35,808
Is the cops ever

1853
01:39:39,648 --> 01:39:40,160
Help

1854
01:39:40,928 --> 01:39:47,072
Transmission

1855
01:40:00,128 --> 01:40:06,272
Oklahoma City

1856
01:40:19,328 --> 01:40:20,352
Live streams

1857
01:40:23,424 --> 01:40:25,216
Yukon 911

1858
01:40:25,984 --> 01:40:27,008
I'm going to see you

1859
01:40:27,776 --> 01:40:31,872
Hell you also did Oklahoma City

1860
01:40:32,640 --> 01:40:33,152
Vietnam

1861
01:40:33,664 --> 01:40:34,944
In Oklahoma City

1862
01:40:35,200 --> 01:40:36,224
When you killed those cops

1863
01:40:36,480 --> 01:40:39,552
Are there any 9/11 when you got John O'Neill

1864
01:40:40,576 --> 01:40:43,904
Well that's about my time so I'm going to get out of here later alright

1865
01:40:44,160 --> 01:40:49,280
Alright G looks like we made a little bit of product

1866
01:40:49,536 --> 01:40:55,680
Anymore cuz he's pretty much done but

1867
01:40:57,728 --> 01:41:03,104
Little bit more and then Owen Shroyer walks by

1868
01:41:03,360 --> 01:41:09,504
Just gets really boring so that I can listen to that special report I think that we've learned

1869
01:41:09,760 --> 01:41:10,784
But Alex is probably

1870
01:41:11,296 --> 01:41:15,904
Reasonably afraid of the revelations that are coming with them looking at Rodger Stone

1871
01:41:16,160 --> 01:41:18,464
I think it'll be interesting to see what happens with

1872
01:41:18,720 --> 01:41:20,000
Beyond that I think

1873
01:41:20,256 --> 01:41:20,768
Did Alex

1874
01:41:21,536 --> 01:41:23,840
I mean what we have to do is be if that you know

1875
01:41:24,352 --> 01:41:24,864
Really look

1876
01:41:26,144 --> 01:41:26,656
Everything is

1877
01:41:27,168 --> 01:41:29,728
All of these stories are such lies

1878
01:41:29,984 --> 01:41:34,080
Bruce Ivins was murdered and they forced tylenol.is mouth

1879
01:41:34,592 --> 01:41:38,944
Uo8 order to believe that you have to believe that every other thing that Bruce

1880
01:41:39,200 --> 01:41:40,480
Did isn't real

1881
01:41:40,992 --> 01:41:41,760
And that

1882
01:41:42,272 --> 01:41:43,552
Baxter's document

1883
01:41:44,064 --> 01:41:50,208
Chrysler's everything is document email gave to these other coworkers

1884
01:41:50,464 --> 01:41:54,560
The timestamps of him signing in and out of the lab during suspicious hours

1885
01:41:54,816 --> 01:41:56,864
You know what that sounds like Neil is doing

1886
01:41:57,120 --> 01:41:58,656
But it itches everything comes back to

1887
01:41:58,912 --> 01:42:00,960
Everything is alive but it's a

1888
01:42:01,472 --> 01:42:01,984
Capitola July

1889
01:42:02,240 --> 01:42:03,264
That's why people fall for it

1890
01:42:04,032 --> 01:42:04,544
Anyway

1891
01:42:05,824 --> 01:42:09,664
They were the present I don't know how much longer we're going to be doing present stuff but

1892
01:42:09,920 --> 01:42:11,200
Enjoy it

1893
01:42:12,992 --> 01:42:14,528
God just watching

1894
01:42:15,040 --> 01:42:16,320
Watching Stone

1895
01:42:17,088 --> 01:42:19,136
So nonchalantly be like

1896
01:42:19,648 --> 01:42:20,672
Oh I'm going to be indicted

1897
01:42:21,184 --> 01:42:27,328
I'd like any even had that ratfucker smile I was just like I'm just like

1898
01:42:27,584 --> 01:42:33,728
I can't wait to tell you all about that

1899
01:42:33,984 --> 01:42:35,008
From

1900
01:42:35,264 --> 01:42:39,360
2016 on he's known that there will be is this

1901
01:42:43,200 --> 01:42:48,320
Does he have cancer something does he have some kind of like

1902
01:42:48,576 --> 01:42:54,720
You'll never catch me motherfukers last ace-in-the-hole like he's got to have something I think some part of him knows

1903
01:42:55,232 --> 01:42:56,256
You can sell some people out

1904
01:42:56,768 --> 01:42:57,280
Okay

1905
01:42:57,536 --> 01:42:58,560
I think that's probably

1906
01:42:59,328 --> 01:43:00,608
I think that's probably the

1907
01:43:00,864 --> 01:43:02,400
What you're replying

1908
01:43:02,656 --> 01:43:04,960
Is it still in him

1909
01:43:05,216 --> 01:43:08,032
Is probably an awareness that he has another fish

1910
01:43:08,544 --> 01:43:10,848
That he can throw in

1911
01:43:11,104 --> 01:43:11,872
Cell

1912
01:43:12,384 --> 01:43:15,456
Given his history given who he is as a person

1913
01:43:15,968 --> 01:43:16,992
I think that

1914
01:43:18,016 --> 01:43:21,600
I think that he knows he's safe because he's not the most important

1915
01:43:22,112 --> 01:43:22,880
Primary

1916
01:43:23,136 --> 01:43:29,280
So f****** insane

1917
01:43:29,536 --> 01:43:33,376
Knowledge underscore

1918
01:43:33,632 --> 01:43:39,776
You can do that and go to our Facebook group also sorry I forgot to put that to clip together again will do it on the next

1919
01:43:40,032 --> 01:43:40,544
You're the worst

1920
01:43:40,800 --> 01:43:41,312
I am

1921
01:43:41,568 --> 01:43:46,176
A busy man anyway also we're on iTunes please

1922
01:43:46,432 --> 01:43:48,480
Describe All That Glitters.

1923
01:43:49,504 --> 01:43:53,344
It is my turn and I think there's only one

1924
01:43:54,880 --> 01:43:55,392
One person

1925
01:43:55,904 --> 01:43:56,672
Tutela to go fuc

1926
01:43:57,952 --> 01:43:58,464
And that

1927
01:43:59,232 --> 01:44:05,376
Every single conservative in this f****** country can go f****** kill themselves

1928
01:44:09,216 --> 01:44:13,056
Alexandra Thurston color with your trip and I love your work
