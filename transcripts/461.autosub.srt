1
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:20,992
Air Jordan X swetik

2
00:00:21,504 --> 00:00:27,648
I have great respect for knowledge by knowledge I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys

3
00:00:27,904 --> 00:00:34,048
We are the bad guy

4
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:05,536
Fix it around a little bit about Alex Jones

5
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:10,912
Jordan

6
00:01:11,424 --> 00:01:14,752
Interesting Lee

7
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:19,104
Decided to start playing the origami King

8
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:22,432
The origami King Paper Mario game

9
00:01:25,248 --> 00:01:29,856
Paper Mario

10
00:01:30,112 --> 00:01:34,208
Super Paper Mario

11
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:35,232
Next one

12
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,328
Color Splash with a disaster that game sucked

13
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:41,120
Alright

14
00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:42,656
Okay it made me mad

15
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:43,424
It was sober

16
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:45,728
Created by

17
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:52,896
I know there was a new Paper Mario coming out and

18
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:53,920
Are you playing it

19
00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:58,528
I don't want to spoil anything cuz it's a fairly new game so people might want to play it

20
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:01,600
It's not that

21
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:04,672
It got pretty f****** dark in the middle

22
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:08,256
Arizona play a cartoon

23
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:11,584
2D game

24
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:14,400
It's I had to stop play again I put it down

25
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:17,984
Pick back up Hyrule Warriors

26
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:24,384
Dynasty Warriors characters

27
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:31,040
Great I love just running around

28
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:37,440
Going through Army the Warriors

29
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:38,720
And I think Hyrule Warriors

30
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,048
Because you're just mass murder

31
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:46,656
I guess there

32
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:53,056
That's not good but getting around

33
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:56,640
Can you find a certain kind

34
00:02:57,664 --> 00:02:58,432
To me it's

35
00:02:58,688 --> 00:03:02,016
It's not so much about like sort of

36
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:03,808
Mass amount of Darkness

37
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:06,624
As it is the context of it

38
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:10,208
Like the context of the darkness Paper Mario

39
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:11,232
About spoilers

40
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:12,256
Inappropriate

41
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,096
No it was

42
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:17,376
It is not

43
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:25,824
Situation

44
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,360
Whatever it is

45
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:35,296
A battle it makes sense that you're fighting it shouldn't it's not killing

46
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:38,368
It's KOA

47
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:40,672
Totally

48
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:42,464
Okay

49
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:50,144
Weird

50
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:53,984
Obviously my brights

51
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:55,520
The Cubs won their opener

52
00:03:55,776 --> 00:04:01,920
Update

53
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:06,272
Chicago Cubs

54
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,464
But

55
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:20,095
What's wrong

56
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:25,215
Ever since Dexter Fowler left after the 2016 World Series and that is because the Rick

57
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:35,711
Okay

58
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:42,623
Yeah they've had in the past superstitions in Cubs fan

59
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:48,767
Literally has superstitions

60
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:51,583
That's probably true

61
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:56,191
That's probably true I don't know if that's actually very happy for you

62
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:56,959
The Cubs

63
00:04:58,495 --> 00:04:59,519
Good good weird

64
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:02,591
Terrible year,

65
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:09,247
We're going to be talking about a special report that Alex released on Saturday

66
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:14,879
And

67
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:17,951
Studio

68
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:22,815
The complete breakdown of Wiseman out of Studio

69
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:30,239
Is baby running around

70
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:32,799
You can hear weird noises in stomach

71
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:33,823
He

72
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:43,295
His appeal in the Connecticut Supreme Court and he was going to have to pay these section

73
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:46,879
Turn over documents

74
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:49,183
Send Sandy Hook lawsuit or sewage

75
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:53,791
And obviously the presumption is but maybe he had to go to Connecticut

76
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:54,815
You know like your

77
00:05:55,071 --> 00:06:00,191
The Connecticut Supreme Court's not coming to Austin maybe he has to go appear

78
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:02,239
That may not be the case

79
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:05,567
May not be the case

80
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:09,663

Christopher Nolan

113
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:28,927
Exciting

114
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:35,327
Polar is this company I forgot this is going to get deeply into the year of the

115
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:42,495
Aaron's Zaxby's Polar Seltzer does summer varietals

116
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:47,615
Even so there's like a raspberry Rose flavored

117
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:53,503
Strawberry margarita

118
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:59,391
Yeah until I tried a couple of them

119
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:02,207
I am starting to come around to this position

120
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:05,279
And that is I think polar might be

121
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:12,447
I don't know where the sports guy so you could probably get a better way that cats like this

122
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:13,215
Good or bad

123
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:14,239
Good

124
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:20,639
Most reliable cars

I don't think I've had any molars that have been

126
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:28,063
Bad I think you're pretty

127
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:34,463
Consistent and pretty good and also they have a lot of different flavors like around quite a bit

128
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:36,255
Blueberry lemonade seltzer

No

134
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:49,055
When we started this year the shelter back in April

135
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:50,847
Got a lot of really angry messages

136
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:52,127
People from the Northeast

137
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:53,919
Who are really into Polar

138
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:54,687
And I wasn't

139
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:57,247
Drinking enough polar and there were like hey

00:09:57,503 --> 00:10:00,831
Why don't you drink some polar

141
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:03,391
Hey assholes

00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:04,415

197
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:38,271
Trump

198
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:39,295
Is King

199
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:40,319
Yes is gyro

200
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:42,111
Gyros

201
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:44,927
Has come out and worn a mask

202
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:49,279
Betty's

203
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:55,679
Because Alex has been

204
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:00,031
Trump is submitted

205
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:06,687
It's a difficult position that Alex finds himself in this first

206
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:08,223
To rationalize that a little bit

207
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:10,783
Is President Trump playing 3D chess

208
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:14,111
Are you is he being blackmailed somehow by the Deep state

209
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:15,647
There's make no mistake

210
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:18,207
Option bar

211
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:20,511
The world government UND State they are

212
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:22,815
A planetary government

213
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:24,607
The carryout Eugenics that is on

214
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:26,655
Record what has happened to President Trump

215
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:28,447
Has he been captured

216
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:29,983
Has he been compromised

217
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:32,287
You can hear people in the background there this is

218
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:38,687
This is weird weird audio Disney World

219
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:45,087
Maybe an airport or something record these things at airports

220
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:53,023
He famously chased Bernie Sanders

221
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:59,423
Yeah it's strange I guess we're now entering the. Where Trump is blackmailed by the globalist

222
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:04,543
Here's what I would say to that.

223
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:05,567
If

224
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:09,407
Globalist blackmail were effective now

225
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:13,503
Globalist

226
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:19,903
Just discover about Trump this is effective

227
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:20,927
Good question

228
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:25,023
Possibly how is this narrative supposed to stick

229
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:28,095
What could there be that would be

230
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:29,119
Like

231
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:30,911
Just now found out about

232
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:37,055
This man has been obsessively in the public eye scrambling his entire life

233
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:38,591
Forever

234
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:40,383
We just now found out

235
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:41,663
At the age of

236
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:44,479
What is e79

237
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:49,087
Hitler

238
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:50,879
What is it what could be

239
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:52,159
I don't know

240
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:54,975
You do I do I do I do I don't know

241
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:55,743
I don't know

242
00:14:55,999 --> 00:15:01,375
Nonsense to me

243
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:04,191
You are so desperate

244
00:15:04,447 --> 00:15:07,519
Trump can't deny any longer that is like

245
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:13,407
Situation

246
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:15,455
Surrounding Public Health

247
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:18,527
It ruins everything

248
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:24,927
Been forever either Trump is in bed with the globalist

249
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:27,487
It's not going to work this is this is dumb

250
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:29,279
Pissed off

251
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:31,583
And

252
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:33,887
This is this this to me is strange

253
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:37,471
Chip just a week ago

254
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:41,311
I'm getting into the fratta getting into the false testing

255
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:43,871
But now he has reversed

256
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:46,943
And it's a it's a scary situation

257
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:49,759
I don't think I'm some bad guy still supporting

258
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:54,879
Are we concerned

259
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:57,183
So we really have to

260
00:15:57,439 --> 00:15:58,207
Oceanofapk

261
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:00,511
We're going to have to do it

262
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:07,167
Doing good a week ago but now he's

263
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:13,823
Place where we cannot question our leaders

264
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:20,223
Waiting for another Frozen Burger

265
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:20,991
Rita

266
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:24,831
That's a good place to pee I suppose

267
00:16:25,343 --> 00:16:29,183
Is it going to take

268
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:31,743
Does it have to get for Alex

269
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:32,767
To finally be like

270
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:37,375
Hey I mean it only makes sense that it would have happened to Trump sooner

271
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:39,423
Like that it would have gotten bad enough

272
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:45,823
Alex

273
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:51,967
That gets bad enough for Alex's it's like well now that Trump is even like

274
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:54,783
F***** up Alex

275
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:56,319
Or be like

276
00:16:58,367 --> 00:17:04,511
I don't know I mean I guess it's hard to predict any of that stuff but what I would say is that

277
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:06,303
A question

278
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:07,071
Put up with

279
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:12,959
It turns out he'll put up with being uncertain whether Trump is in bed with a global issue

280
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:14,239
Apparently

281
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:17,823
Who is Insider information has gone real quick

282
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:21,663
Bar

283
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:29,087
It's in a pool

284
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:33,439
That's one of the

285
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:34,719
Reports

286
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:36,511
There's another report

287
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:38,047
But I can't really addresses

288
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:40,095
Alex makes a little bit of an announcement

289
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:41,375
Just say this

290
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:42,143
My daughter

291
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:44,191
Standing out in the woods the other day

292
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:47,775
She said that I took my nap at 2

293
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:50,079
She said

294
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:51,359
I want to stay awake

295
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:52,639
Dodge

296
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:53,919
World

297
00:17:54,175 --> 00:17:55,455
So beautiful

298
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:56,479
I'll be backwards

299
00:17:56,991 --> 00:17:58,015
Cheryl Turner I

300
00:17:58,527 --> 00:18:00,831
And she was feeling. Power and University

301
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:03,647
Humans are incredible

302
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:05,695
We have been given a proper missions

303
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:08,255
Automation for

304
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:09,535
And it is true

305
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:10,559
People with stars

306
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:12,351
So I am going to set up

307
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:16,447
Kemah Defense Force Foundation

308
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:20,031
Damage be a man with a club smashing a robot that's Superman

309
00:18:20,287 --> 00:18:21,823
Crazy something love

310
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:24,127
Symbolizes

311
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:25,663
Oh my God

312
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:32,831
Thank you for doing what somebody should have done a long time ago

313
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:46,399
It's time for me to start a foundation to put people on Mercury

314
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:48,191
Look

315
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:54,591
People think you got a big that's when you exact that's what you do

316
00:18:56,895 --> 00:18:57,663
Businesses like

317
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:04,063
Tesla

318
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:07,647
Populate the Stars

319
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:11,487
3

320
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:17,375
We're going to set the world on fire with this iconography of a human eating a robot with a stick

321
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:23,007
Let's do a live for these days

322
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:25,055
I don't know

323
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:31,455
Gut tells me first about this never going to happen

324
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:40,671
Does happen

325
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:43,487
Also falls in line

326
00:19:43,743 --> 00:19:44,255
About

327
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:45,791
Him hiding assets

328
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:50,655
Two people the Stars

329
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:57,311
Because they were

330
00:19:58,847 --> 00:20:02,175
You can hide buddy

331
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:08,575
Other novel novel swing for a divorce court

332
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:18,047
What are you guys doing getting in my way

333
00:20:18,303 --> 00:20:19,327
God

334
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:24,959
Oh yeah you got to keep it if you want to live up in space

335
00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:26,751
Your kids going to be in space

336
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:27,775
How about vexed

337
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:30,335
Great

338
00:20:32,127 --> 00:20:33,151
So dumb

339
00:20:38,527 --> 00:20:41,343
Even hire a competent second-in-command

340
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:44,671
You can't find a second person who's good on air

341
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:48,511
Don't f*** is wrong with you

342
00:20:49,535 --> 00:20:53,375
Article about your studio

343
00:20:53,631 --> 00:20:55,679
Twice a week because of tech glitches

344
00:20:56,191 --> 00:20:59,519
You're going to kill people who try to go to space

345
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:12,063
Oh my God I just got word on Twitter that there's a globalist on my spaceship I'll board

346
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:16,159
Goddamn globalist

347
00:21:16,672 --> 00:21:20,512
So funny though like it slow high-stakes the LIE

348
00:21:25,888 --> 00:21:27,680
Comical anybody

349
00:21:29,728 --> 00:21:30,496
Alex

350
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:31,264
God

351
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,288
Awesome

352
00:21:33,568 --> 00:21:34,080
I just

353
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:35,872
I think you should go the other

354
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:42,528
What's that

355
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:49,184
Thinks he's going to make it we've already got those assholes on it I'm going to go find a Morlock

356
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,720
Nobody else has big in these days

357
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:55,328
Recent movies about digging all the time

358
00:21:55,584 --> 00:21:57,120
To create a bunker

359
00:21:57,376 --> 00:21:58,656
And also

360
00:21:58,912 --> 00:21:59,936
Like really hot

361
00:22:00,192 --> 00:22:03,264
In 2012 you know what date

362
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:06,592
And I think people got exhausted

363
00:22:06,848 --> 00:22:10,432
I think the Doomsday bunker stuff kind of like a came and wiped

364
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:11,712
Not as chic

365
00:22:11,968 --> 00:22:14,784
Anymore and I don't think Alex feels like it's as exciting

366
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:17,856
Better Pitchfork most of the stuff you're going to find out there is bugs

367
00:22:19,136 --> 00:22:20,160
Not if you dig underneath

368
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:22,208
Spaghettio it already does

369
00:22:22,464 --> 00:22:27,584
Please up with Steven Kelly zactly they get a diagonal it's like in There Will Be Blood

370
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,632
Drinks the Nazis milkshake

371
00:22:33,216 --> 00:22:35,008
Jordan if you can afford

372
00:22:35,264 --> 00:22:36,800
A f****** spaceship

373
00:22:37,568 --> 00:22:39,616
You can afford to build one of those bulldozers

374
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:42,944
They haven't cartoons that has like a big

375
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:48,320
Do I pick maybe I'm thinking of something from Ninja Turtles

376
00:22:49,344 --> 00:22:50,112
It'll fit.

377
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:53,696
To see what how is it going I was going to do with that

378
00:22:58,816 --> 00:23:02,144
Money I'm sure

379
00:23:02,656 --> 00:23:03,936
I'm not going to join that

380
00:23:04,448 --> 00:23:05,728
So

381
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:06,496
Report

382
00:23:07,008 --> 00:23:07,776
Freezing outside

383
00:23:08,032 --> 00:23:10,592
Because not even explain more about the human descent

384
00:23:10,848 --> 00:23:12,128
League but I'm going to keep

385
00:23:12,384 --> 00:23:13,920
Very close eye on them

386
00:23:14,688 --> 00:23:20,832
Maybe the top story for the rest of my life

387
00:23:21,088 --> 00:23:22,624
I don't know if I want them defending

388
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:26,208
I prefer Alex

389
00:23:27,744 --> 00:23:29,536
This next one is from the same report

390
00:23:33,888 --> 00:23:36,448
Come to Jesus

391
00:23:36,704 --> 00:23:39,264
I just want to play this look as a really

392
00:23:39,776 --> 00:23:45,152
Like Stark reminder that I make this reminder from time to time and I think I should probably make it more

393
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:48,736
Alex deserves to be treated like a religious zealot

394
00:23:48,992 --> 00:23:50,784
Much

395
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:54,368
Political commentator

396
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:56,672
In

397
00:23:57,184 --> 00:24:02,048
He's like it in his actual capacity and what he is actually doing at this point

398
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:06,656
This is cultured man is definitely running a religious thing

399
00:24:07,168 --> 00:24:09,216
And the entire Book of Revelations be entirely

400
00:24:21,504 --> 00:24:23,296
Epsom salt

401
00:24:23,808 --> 00:24:25,088
I can fix them in Transcendence

402
00:24:27,648 --> 00:24:29,184
Can we pass over the bridge

403
00:24:30,464 --> 00:24:36,096
I'm sure death and destruction everyone knows it

404
00:24:36,352 --> 00:24:39,424
It stinks to high heaven every part of it is a line of betrayal

405
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,448
Turn back

406
00:24:40,704 --> 00:24:41,216
Maddie

407
00:24:41,472 --> 00:24:42,752
CarMax

408
00:24:43,264 --> 00:24:44,288
Curry sauce

409
00:24:45,056 --> 00:24:45,824
The starting evil

410
00:24:46,336 --> 00:24:49,152
Bipolar still time if you can feel

411
00:24:51,968 --> 00:24:54,528
You can even hear my voice and nmn feel like

412
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:56,576
You want to reach out of want to get out of your in

413
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:03,232
Show me how powerful you are show me how you rule the universe

414
00:25:03,744 --> 00:25:07,840
I'm weak I need you to help me I Repent of what I've done I want change

415
00:25:08,352 --> 00:25:12,448
Show me in the minute the second you make a decision haltern

416
00:25:12,704 --> 00:25:13,728
It's got to be legitimate

417
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:22,944
It's the only way it's supposed to be a political show this is supposed to be a show about like banking

418
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:26,016
Conspiracies

419
00:25:26,272 --> 00:25:30,624
Posse Comitatus

420
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:34,208
Dobama

421
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,000
That's not cool

422
00:25:36,256 --> 00:25:37,536
I do I do like

423
00:25:37,792 --> 00:25:43,936
Do that

424
00:25:44,192 --> 00:25:49,568
Let's say in there talking about the rise of the Tea Party and talking about

425
00:25:49,824 --> 00:25:50,336
You know there's

426
00:25:54,432 --> 00:25:55,968
Freedomworks

427
00:25:56,224 --> 00:25:59,808
These are cook related foundations YouTube

428
00:26:02,112 --> 00:26:04,672
What turns out the devil is half

429
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,512
This is Ludacris

430
00:26:24,896 --> 00:26:25,408
We will be set

431
00:26:27,456 --> 00:26:28,224
And everybody who doesn't

432
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:28,992
What is going

433
00:26:29,248 --> 00:26:29,760
To burn

434
00:26:30,784 --> 00:26:35,136
Here we are on fresh air

435
00:26:35,392 --> 00:26:37,184
Yeah I mean

436
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:39,232
He should be embarrassed

437
00:26:39,488 --> 00:26:40,512
He's embarrassed

438
00:26:41,024 --> 00:26:45,888
I only missed to be at all anyways people who are religious

439
00:26:47,168 --> 00:26:47,680
Like that's

440
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:54,336
You know that's a wonderful thing or it can be and then I respect people's right to believe whatever they want and if you want

441
00:26:54,592 --> 00:26:55,872
To do a religious show

442
00:26:56,128 --> 00:26:57,920
You want to do a show that's about like

443
00:26:58,176 --> 00:27:04,320
Hey here here is me talking about faith and the intersections of ways that affect my life

444
00:27:04,832 --> 00:27:06,624
Interviewing people about their path

445
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:09,184
I think that's wonderful I think that's great

446
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,464
So I don't

447
00:27:10,976 --> 00:27:14,048
I don't want to waste any of my time sitting here like

448
00:27:14,304 --> 00:27:18,144
Making fun of somebody for doing a religious show Alex

449
00:27:18,656 --> 00:27:19,168
For this

450
00:27:19,424 --> 00:27:21,216
I like titties on the road like

451
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:24,288
This is so much like a

452
00:27:24,544 --> 00:27:25,056
When

453
00:27:28,384 --> 00:27:32,224
You know one of those things where all the sudden you see a documentary 20 years later and it's like

454
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:35,296
The leader while he was on the 10th in VHS

455
00:27:35,808 --> 00:27:37,088
Did everybody shared and watched

456
00:27:37,344 --> 00:27:37,856
Together

457
00:27:38,368 --> 00:27:44,512
That's exactly what Alex sounds like right now he has but he's sending you a message just to make

458
00:27:46,048 --> 00:27:49,632
The globalist

459
00:27:49,888 --> 00:27:51,424
Nevermind

460
00:27:52,192 --> 00:27:52,960
I don't know if

461
00:27:55,264 --> 00:27:58,080
Saturday

462
00:27:58,336 --> 00:28:01,664
I believe you were turned on Friday evening

463
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:04,736
Comes into the studio and he does

464
00:28:04,992 --> 00:28:06,016
Special Report

465
00:28:09,856 --> 00:28:15,232
Go ahead this is a little bit out of order but I'm going to play from The Middle

466
00:28:15,488 --> 00:28:17,792
Report first started

467
00:28:18,048 --> 00:28:18,816
Beginning

468
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:23,168
I think it's important to recognize that there's clearly a point that Alex wanted to make

469
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:24,960
Eastgate

470
00:28:25,216 --> 00:28:30,080
Very rare

471
00:28:30,592 --> 00:28:31,872
And in this clip

472
00:28:32,384 --> 00:28:33,408
From about

473
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:36,992
I don't know 10 minutes in this special report Alex

474
00:28:37,248 --> 00:28:38,528
Lays out his pieces

475
00:28:40,576 --> 00:28:41,088
Trump

476
00:28:42,624 --> 00:28:43,392
President-trump

477
00:28:44,672 --> 00:28:45,440
President-trump

478
00:28:49,536 --> 00:28:50,048
Wellness emerging

479
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:00,288
Good

480
00:29:01,056 --> 00:29:04,896
Studio

481
00:29:05,152 --> 00:29:05,920
And really get into

482
00:29:06,688 --> 00:29:07,200
So

483
00:29:07,456 --> 00:29:08,736
We'll see what he says about that

484
00:29:08,992 --> 00:29:09,504
I think I can

485
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:10,784
Yes

486
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,576
Extraneous bulshit

487
00:29:13,088 --> 00:29:14,112
Same s***

488
00:29:14,368 --> 00:29:14,880
Ran over

489
00:29:15,392 --> 00:29:17,184
Fauci created this virus

490
00:29:17,696 --> 00:29:19,744
Call China virus

491
00:29:21,536 --> 00:29:24,608
Just the same stuff over and over again and so a lot of Italy

492
00:29:24,864 --> 00:29:27,424
You would expect he's coming back in from a week off

493
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:30,752
Maybe I had a steam maybe a lot of like a

494
00:29:31,008 --> 00:29:34,336
Finally got his daughter out of the should be feeling good

495
00:29:34,592 --> 00:29:35,872
It's a it's not it's

496
00:29:36,128 --> 00:29:38,176
It's a lot of just a repetition of

497
00:29:38,432 --> 00:29:39,200
Very similar to

498
00:29:39,456 --> 00:29:40,736
But with the addition

499
00:29:40,992 --> 00:29:42,528
Of this new thesis question

500
00:29:42,784 --> 00:29:44,832
Which is Easter a friend or Foe

501
00:29:45,344 --> 00:29:47,648
Which I could have answered for him in 2015

502
00:29:48,416 --> 00:29:49,440
And he has Affirmed

503
00:29:49,696 --> 00:29:50,976
15

504
00:29:51,232 --> 00:29:52,000
Conductivity

505
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:58,912
So he was out of signal for a week and like I said I thought he was probably dealing with legal issues

506
00:29:59,168 --> 00:29:59,680
Nope

507
00:30:00,192 --> 00:30:00,704
Where I go

508
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:01,984
I am Mom

509
00:30:10,432 --> 00:30:11,456
Springs

510
00:30:18,368 --> 00:30:18,880
Came up to

511
00:30:21,184 --> 00:30:21,696
Brazil

512
00:30:22,464 --> 00:30:23,744
That we love what you're doing it

513
00:30:25,024 --> 00:30:25,536
Take action

514
00:30:28,096 --> 00:30:28,608
Selection

515
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:29,632
Positive

516
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:32,192
Special Saturday

517
00:30:35,776 --> 00:30:40,128
Like Alex

518
00:30:44,992 --> 00:30:46,016
Say first of all

519
00:30:46,528 --> 00:30:49,088
In terms of Public Health.

520
00:30:49,344 --> 00:30:54,976
Probably the riskiest trip you could make right now is Texas to Florida

521
00:30:55,232 --> 00:30:58,304
Decision right now but I guess Alex

522
00:30:58,816 --> 00:31:02,400
It doesn't believe any of this is real anyway so what you going to do

523
00:31:02,656 --> 00:31:05,472
From California to Florida did everybody write back

524
00:31:05,728 --> 00:31:06,752
To Texas that's where I

525
00:31:07,008 --> 00:31:09,568
So when I hear this

526
00:31:09,824 --> 00:31:14,432
And I recognize that a month ago Alex went on another Beach vacation

527
00:31:14,944 --> 00:31:16,224
To the Gulf of Mexico

528
00:31:18,016 --> 00:31:20,832
See this is more evidence that the end is coming

529
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:27,744
What do you do whenever you recognize it like a pretty soon I probably won't be able to afford the lavish lifestyle that I live

530
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:33,376
Let's get as much this like let's take some trips while we can

531
00:31:33,632 --> 00:31:36,704
There's going to be hell coming soon there's a really hectic

532
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:40,288
. whatever station

533
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:41,824
Is a little much

534
00:31:42,336 --> 00:31:45,152
Alex Jones

535
00:31:45,408 --> 00:31:51,552
He claims that he's got the globalist by the balls and or evil

536
00:31:52,064 --> 00:31:53,088
Presidential election

537
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:58,720
It just seems like this is not the time to be taking multiple vacation

538
00:31:59,232 --> 00:32:03,072
Unless there's another reason

539
00:32:04,352 --> 00:32:04,864
You know it

540
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:11,008
It's so important rested this whole American Myth about you always got to work

541
00:32:11,264 --> 00:32:12,800
14 hour days.

542
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:13,568
Sometimes

543
00:32:13,824 --> 00:32:15,360
Need to be rested to really

544
00:32:15,616 --> 00:32:16,896
Come at the material with a

545
00:32:17,152 --> 00:32:17,920
Clear mind

546
00:32:18,176 --> 00:32:20,480
He's going to finally explain what's going on

547
00:32:20,736 --> 00:32:26,880
This report

548
00:32:29,952 --> 00:32:31,744
You're not far off

549
00:32:34,048 --> 00:32:34,816
Outside

550
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:37,632
Application

551
00:32:38,144 --> 00:32:40,448
I do think people do need to recharge the batteries

552
00:32:40,704 --> 00:32:41,984
You take time off and I respect that

553
00:32:42,496 --> 00:32:46,080
And that's why I wouldn't be all that like weird about Alex taking a vacation

554
00:32:46,592 --> 00:32:49,152
Like maybe twice a year or something you know like

555
00:32:50,688 --> 00:32:52,480
What's a month-to-month

556
00:32:53,248 --> 00:32:56,576
Little bit now as we all know it's July

557
00:32:57,088 --> 00:32:57,600
One week

558
00:32:57,856 --> 00:32:59,904
Capay brick vacation per month

559
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:02,976
Every one of his employees

560
00:33:03,232 --> 00:33:04,768
A b Martin

561
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:07,328
Maybe

562
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:10,656
Tucker's going on vacation I got to go to

563
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,496
Obsessed with

564
00:33:14,752 --> 00:33:16,544
Like following a Tucker's

565
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:21,152
Florida

566
00:33:21,408 --> 00:33:23,712
Is the stone still down in Florida did he go see Stone

567
00:33:23,968 --> 00:33:24,992
Responsibility

568
00:33:26,272 --> 00:33:27,040
I don't know

569
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:31,392
At least he's doing once right or it's like knock on Stone does

570
00:33:31,648 --> 00:33:32,416
Don't tell Mama

571
00:33:34,464 --> 00:33:37,280
C bad word in front of other people

572
00:33:38,304 --> 00:33:39,840
We be in the bayou

573
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:45,472
Yeah I mean I would assume that up with Rodger

574
00:33:47,264 --> 00:33:49,312
Too Much Vacation

575
00:33:49,824 --> 00:33:52,384
Doesn't make sense it's been New World Order

576
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,152
Taking over

577
00:33:53,408 --> 00:33:54,688
As we speak

578
00:33:54,944 --> 00:33:55,712
The devil

579
00:33:55,968 --> 00:33:57,504
It is upon us

580
00:33:59,296 --> 00:34:00,064
Why are you

581
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:01,344
It just

582
00:34:02,112 --> 00:34:03,904
Actions don't match up with

583
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:06,208
The presentation that he's making

584
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,512
So we'll see what happens but just look

585
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:13,376
So Alex starts off this still before

586
00:34:13,888 --> 00:34:14,400
Is this

587
00:34:14,656 --> 00:34:15,168
Complaining about

588
00:34:15,936 --> 00:34:16,960
Unlike you seems mad that

589
00:34:17,216 --> 00:34:19,520
Dr. fauci threw out a first pitch

590
00:34:20,032 --> 00:34:20,544
Fauci

591
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:22,592
Throughout the first

592
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:23,872
Call fer

593
00:34:26,688 --> 00:34:27,200
Before

594
00:34:28,736 --> 00:34:29,248
2 days ago

595
00:34:30,016 --> 00:34:30,528
Sway Austin

596
00:34:32,832 --> 00:34:33,856
Done

597
00:34:35,136 --> 00:34:36,160
Diadem

598
00:34:36,416 --> 00:34:37,184
Hear him

599
00:34:37,696 --> 00:34:38,464
You don't see Trump

600
00:34:40,256 --> 00:34:41,024
Yes you do

601
00:34:42,816 --> 00:34:43,584
Yes you do

602
00:34:47,936 --> 00:34:48,448
He is Al

603
00:34:48,704 --> 00:34:49,216
Little stuff

604
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:51,008
Dwarf that works for the

605
00:34:53,568 --> 00:34:54,080
Drawing

606
00:34:55,104 --> 00:34:56,384
Salutatorians like that

607
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:57,408
Kind of

608
00:34:59,968 --> 00:35:01,504
Apache throughout a picture

609
00:35:04,832 --> 00:35:05,344
You will

610
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:06,368
Who's on the schedule

611
00:35:06,624 --> 00:35:07,392
It's alright

612
00:35:07,648 --> 00:35:10,464
I know that I saw some articles about that but like

613
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:16,864
Wasn't this the same thing that happened like last year like you said he was going to throw out a pitch and then he didn't or something

614
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:22,752
This is this is going to be a big ol show it's going to be a New York I think it's hunky's home opener whatever

615
00:35:23,264 --> 00:35:26,080
This this fall squarely under the headline of I don't care

616
00:35:26,336 --> 00:35:28,896
It's it's 102 trivial thing

617
00:35:29,152 --> 00:35:30,944
Whether or not Trump throws

618
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:31,712
The first pitch

619
00:35:31,968 --> 00:35:34,272
Fauci pitch was good enough for

620
00:35:34,784 --> 00:35:36,320
I don't care it was a great

621
00:35:36,832 --> 00:35:37,600
No I don't care

622
00:35:37,856 --> 00:35:38,368
Oh I do

623
00:35:38,624 --> 00:35:40,416
Okay course I do

624
00:35:43,232 --> 00:35:44,768
No pretty mad about it

625
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:47,072
So he gets to his thesis now at this point

626
00:35:47,328 --> 00:35:48,608
Play the clip

627
00:35:48,864 --> 00:35:49,632
Trump being interviewed

628
00:35:49,888 --> 00:35:51,936
Trump talks about how like

629
00:35:53,984 --> 00:35:58,592
You know there's a situation where we might have a while they were still dealing with their door

630
00:35:59,104 --> 00:36:00,896
Decides to

631
00:36:01,152 --> 00:36:02,432
Check this and

632
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:03,712
Doesn't affect

633
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:04,992
There you go

634
00:36:05,504 --> 00:36:06,272
Trump is fat

635
00:36:13,696 --> 00:36:14,720
Orange

636
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,792
Working for the New World Order

637
00:36:19,072 --> 00:36:19,584
Devil

638
00:36:24,704 --> 00:36:25,216
Devil

639
00:36:25,472 --> 00:36:26,752
Joe

640
00:36:36,224 --> 00:36:36,736
Pro-life March

641
00:36:36,992 --> 00:36:38,016
Republican

642
00:36:38,272 --> 00:36:38,784
Level

643
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:39,808
Trump

644
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,600
Okay so

645
00:36:41,856 --> 00:36:48,000
Within like 30 seconds is yelling about how Trump orange orangutan again for the New World Order

646
00:36:48,256 --> 00:36:48,768
And also

647
00:36:49,024 --> 00:36:51,072
Halo Trump's real deal

648
00:36:51,328 --> 00:36:51,840
It's right

649
00:36:52,096 --> 00:36:54,656
And then he was trying to convince himself not to be

650
00:36:55,424 --> 00:36:59,008
Like a you white devil news like maybe you are a white devil working with

651
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,568
I don't I don't know I mean look

652
00:37:01,824 --> 00:37:02,592
I think

653
00:37:03,616 --> 00:37:07,200
I think it what's going on is that Alex Fields ignored and

654
00:37:07,456 --> 00:37:09,248
The narratives that he

655
00:37:09,504 --> 00:37:10,528
Trump to push

656
00:37:10,784 --> 00:37:12,320
What you felt like Trump was

657
00:37:12,576 --> 00:37:13,344
Quickly

658
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:18,720
Trump and supporting things

659
00:37:18,976 --> 00:37:20,000
That

660
00:37:20,256 --> 00:37:21,280
Are the

661
00:37:23,328 --> 00:37:26,144
Taking a public health situation seriously

662
00:37:28,448 --> 00:37:28,960
Contradict

663
00:37:29,216 --> 00:37:30,496
What you want

664
00:37:30,752 --> 00:37:31,776
And so now it's

665
00:37:32,288 --> 00:37:32,800
The carrot versus

666
00:37:33,824 --> 00:37:36,896
Is just doing this as a performance because

667
00:37:37,152 --> 00:37:40,480
He thinks somehow Trump will respond to tough talk

668
00:37:40,736 --> 00:37:42,016
I think that's all that's going on

669
00:37:42,272 --> 00:37:43,040
And also like

670
00:37:43,296 --> 00:37:43,808
It's just

671
00:37:44,064 --> 00:37:46,368
It's it's it's not a fact-check whenever you're like

672
00:37:46,624 --> 00:37:48,928
I can tell you what's going to happen in the future

673
00:37:50,208 --> 00:37:53,280
No thanks for checking facts just saying

674
00:37:53,536 --> 00:37:55,072
Hey my prediction is

675
00:37:57,376 --> 00:37:58,400
No it's not natural

676
00:38:00,192 --> 00:38:01,472
It's not

677
00:38:01,728 --> 00:38:02,496
Shepherd

678
00:38:02,752 --> 00:38:03,264
Predictions

679
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:05,824
Disagreements

680
00:38:08,128 --> 00:38:08,896
So

681
00:38:11,968 --> 00:38:12,736
Some tough talk

682
00:38:12,992 --> 00:38:14,016
I mean that's that's

683
00:38:19,392 --> 00:38:20,672
Disposable

684
00:38:26,048 --> 00:38:27,328
Both sides

685
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:28,608
Politics

686
00:38:32,448 --> 00:38:33,728
Regardless already calling it

687
00:38:39,616 --> 00:38:40,128
Legitimize

688
00:38:42,944 --> 00:38:43,712
Legitimizing their

689
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:45,760
The virus is now

690
00:38:52,672 --> 00:38:53,952
Also said

691
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:56,512
Trump doesn't

692
00:38:59,584 --> 00:39:00,352
Seriously

693
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:07,008
Alex

694
00:39:07,776 --> 00:39:09,056
Yeah I will throw a

695
00:39:12,896 --> 00:39:15,456
People around

696
00:39:15,712 --> 00:39:17,504
I would say

697
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:18,272
I don't

698
00:39:19,552 --> 00:39:20,832
Understand this because

699
00:39:21,088 --> 00:39:22,112
If what Alex is saying is

700
00:39:23,136 --> 00:39:23,648
Respond

701
00:39:23,904 --> 00:39:25,696
Tough talk nice dream

702
00:39:26,208 --> 00:39:31,072
Then why four years is out of straw

703
00:39:31,328 --> 00:39:34,912
Seems like that would be like not effective back then

704
00:39:35,168 --> 00:39:36,192
Most of what he did

705
00:39:36,448 --> 00:39:38,240
I don't know

706
00:39:38,496 --> 00:39:43,360
Tune to the scale of things like this is why are dirty ass holes

707
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:50,784
That night of crying drunkenly about Trump bombing Syria

708
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:52,832
12

709
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:55,392
It's just sad

710
00:39:55,648 --> 00:39:56,416
It's just very

711
00:39:56,928 --> 00:39:58,464
He just doesn't entertain the thought

712
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,024
That maybe

713
00:40:01,536 --> 00:40:02,304
Just maybe

714
00:40:03,328 --> 00:40:04,352
We got this one wrong

715
00:40:05,632 --> 00:40:07,168
Just not for one second is he like

716
00:40:07,424 --> 00:40:09,728
Is Trump is even Trump is doing

717
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:13,568
Like there's got to be a better angle on Trump is

718
00:40:13,824 --> 00:40:14,592
Blackmail

719
00:40:14,848 --> 00:40:16,128
Yeah but even then

720
00:40:16,896 --> 00:40:21,760
Trump is such a week due to be blackmailed that easily about something that the hoe

721
00:40:22,016 --> 00:40:28,160
That the globe this is the globalist Takeover hasn't been blackmailed up until this point

722
00:40:28,416 --> 00:40:29,696
At the most

723
00:40:29,952 --> 00:40:30,464
Important

724
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:31,232
Point

725
00:40:32,768 --> 00:40:34,048
They just block me home real quick

726
00:40:38,912 --> 00:40:39,424
Like if

727
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:41,216
If Alex is going to try and push this

728
00:40:41,472 --> 00:40:46,336
Or something

729
00:40:47,104 --> 00:40:51,200
They must have stolen

730
00:40:52,736 --> 00:40:54,272
Kidnapped

731
00:40:54,528 --> 00:40:59,136
You don't care about his family

732
00:40:59,392 --> 00:41:00,416
Were they stolen

733
00:41:00,672 --> 00:41:01,952
Let's just have some

734
00:41:02,208 --> 00:41:03,744
Got to be something

735
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:04,512
Yeah

736
00:41:04,768 --> 00:41:06,816
So Alex

737
00:41:07,328 --> 00:41:09,632
Jesus is like I said

738
00:41:09,888 --> 00:41:10,912
Friend or Foe

739
00:41:11,168 --> 00:41:15,520
Alex yelling about how he works for the New World Order

740
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,592
Trump is going along with this scam

741
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:22,944
Or doing this evil stuff for the New World Order wants

742
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:26,784
Respond to me being mean to him

743
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:28,320
Trump is having it both ways

744
00:41:28,576 --> 00:41:29,088
Wallet the same

745
00:41:31,136 --> 00:41:37,280
Position for the election

746
00:41:37,792 --> 00:41:43,936
Okay now what

747
00:41:44,192 --> 00:41:50,336
Devil is going to take over

748
00:41:50,592 --> 00:41:54,943
Credible argument for voting third party

749
00:41:55,199 --> 00:41:59,551
Battle

750
00:42:00,063 --> 00:42:01,599
Empty when he says things like this

751
00:42:02,111 --> 00:42:03,903
Call the fraud out

752
00:42:04,159 --> 00:42:05,439
Don't have half measures

753
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:14,143
Lukewarm

754
00:42:17,727 --> 00:42:18,239
We need

755
00:42:20,031 --> 00:42:21,567
Goes or you

756
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:25,151
Combine run by gas

757
00:42:25,407 --> 00:42:25,919
Those are you

758
00:42:26,687 --> 00:42:27,711
No more half measures

759
00:42:28,735 --> 00:42:31,295
So I mean Alex's language

760
00:42:31,551 --> 00:42:36,159
Hey Trump you take out all these people I've declared enemies or you're out

761
00:42:36,415 --> 00:42:41,023
We all know how this is going to go nothing's going to happen

762
00:42:41,279 --> 00:42:45,631
He's going to make some sort of a f****** mealy-mouthed argument about why

763
00:42:45,887 --> 00:42:47,935
Hey actually it's not Trump's car

764
00:42:48,191 --> 00:42:51,263
Who played this game of thousand times

765
00:42:53,311 --> 00:42:54,335
I just

766
00:42:56,127 --> 00:42:58,943
Lost a creative like something creative

767
00:42:59,199 --> 00:43:04,575
Yeah he's going to have to make the lesser of two evils

768
00:43:05,087 --> 00:43:09,439
Everyone will have to do that if he keeps going down this road

769
00:43:12,511 --> 00:43:14,559
Just scream Ron Paul for 3 hours

770
00:43:16,607 --> 00:43:18,655
Mitsubishi 2015

771
00:43:21,215 --> 00:43:23,007
Just ice cream

772
00:43:24,031 --> 00:43:26,079
Lesson

773
00:43:26,335 --> 00:43:27,615
Future scam artist

774
00:43:31,711 --> 00:43:32,223
Like

775
00:43:32,479 --> 00:43:33,759
Never stop

776
00:43:34,015 --> 00:43:35,039
Supporting your dead

777
00:43:35,295 --> 00:43:36,063
Candidates

778
00:43:36,575 --> 00:43:38,623
Never stop if you are

779
00:43:38,879 --> 00:43:40,927
Some sort of a scam person in

780
00:43:41,183 --> 00:43:42,463
Our political friends

781
00:43:43,231 --> 00:43:45,791
And you've built up his whole cottage industry surrounding

782
00:43:46,047 --> 00:43:50,143
Not trusting anyone in the establishment and everybody is evil except for x

783
00:43:50,911 --> 00:43:51,935
Never

784
00:43:52,191 --> 00:43:52,703
Straight

785
00:43:53,471 --> 00:43:55,007
Keep on the ramp

786
00:43:56,287 --> 00:43:57,055
Date 7

787
00:43:57,823 --> 00:43:58,335
Still

788
00:43:58,591 --> 00:44:04,223
No debate with red flowers

789
00:44:04,479 --> 00:44:06,015
Binoculars

790
00:44:08,575 --> 00:44:09,599
Yeah I just looked

791
00:44:11,391 --> 00:44:14,975
Alec almost all the problems in his life could probably have been averted if you would have just

792
00:44:15,743 --> 00:44:16,255
Stayed with

793
00:44:16,511 --> 00:44:17,535
Rand Ron Paul

794
00:44:17,791 --> 00:44:19,839
Do you know I think what strange

795
00:44:20,095 --> 00:44:21,631
We will ultimately

796
00:44:21,887 --> 00:44:23,167
Have created at the end of the

797
00:44:23,935 --> 00:44:25,983
We're at the end of our examination of Alex J

798
00:44:26,239 --> 00:44:27,007
It's not the end of our show

799
00:44:28,031 --> 00:44:33,407
But I think we accidentally created the best manual for a scammer in history

800
00:44:33,919 --> 00:44:34,687
Like us

801
00:44:34,943 --> 00:44:41,087
Going through every mistake that Alex has ever made in his career and even pitching better alternative

802
00:44:45,695 --> 00:44:49,279
Yeah I mean that is an unfortunate side-effect

803
00:44:49,535 --> 00:44:51,839
Stone sharpening grifters against

804
00:44:54,143 --> 00:44:55,935
I guess I mean

805
00:44:56,447 --> 00:45:01,311
Good with the bad I suppose evil

806
00:45:01,823 --> 00:45:02,847
Terra Vista

807
00:45:03,103 --> 00:45:06,431
Their techniques

808
00:45:07,455 --> 00:45:09,247
For anybody who's looking to our show

809
00:45:13,343 --> 00:45:16,159
Malik says fauci

810
00:45:16,671 --> 00:45:18,207
Like I said

811
00:45:18,463 --> 00:45:19,743
It's it's

812
00:45:21,535 --> 00:45:23,071
It's a baby throwing a tantrum

813
00:45:23,327 --> 00:45:24,607
Yeah and if he goes

814
00:45:24,863 --> 00:45:26,399
It's not like fauci

815
00:45:27,167 --> 00:45:29,983
It's not like you're going to replace Trump with somebody who's going to get rid of Snapchat

816
00:45:31,519 --> 00:45:32,543
To keep

817
00:45:32,799 --> 00:45:34,847
He's also going to keep

818
00:45:35,871 --> 00:45:37,151
So there's no there's no

819
00:45:37,663 --> 00:45:39,199
If you are that Little Falls

820
00:45:39,455 --> 00:45:44,575
Position for like 40-something years

821
00:45:44,831 --> 00:45:46,367
The past few months

822
00:45:46,623 --> 00:45:47,135
Yeah

823
00:45:48,927 --> 00:45:49,695
Actually know how old he is

824
00:45:49,951 --> 00:45:54,047
Yes but I don't know when people retire either so

825
00:45:54,303 --> 00:45:59,423
I could see him retiring at some point but this is just stupid

826
00:46:01,215 --> 00:46:04,287
The diseconomy of Hugo Warfare Chico's

827
00:46:04,543 --> 00:46:05,823
Is empty its meaning

828
00:46:06,591 --> 00:46:07,103
It's just

829
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:09,151
Trump and it doesn't even

830
00:46:09,407 --> 00:46:11,967
Continue more than 5 minutes on this

831
00:46:12,479 --> 00:46:13,503
Episode because

832
00:46:23,231 --> 00:46:23,743
Chilling

833
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:29,631
Come out

834
00:46:30,143 --> 00:46:30,655
Say that

835
00:46:31,167 --> 00:46:31,679
Real death

836
00:46:34,239 --> 00:46:35,519
You know development it's all good

837
00:46:35,775 --> 00:46:39,359
It's the same thing as ever like Trump is good he is here

838
00:46:40,895 --> 00:46:42,687
But everyone around him is that

839
00:46:44,479 --> 00:46:44,991
He still hired

840
00:46:46,271 --> 00:46:50,623
And then he's fired a bunch of hired other

841
00:46:51,391 --> 00:46:56,767
So not only as a hired cowards the first time

842
00:46:57,023 --> 00:46:59,327
Multiple times to fill the same position

843
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:00,351
Have you

844
00:47:00,607 --> 00:47:02,911
Considered

845
00:47:09,311 --> 00:47:09,823
Obama

846
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:11,615
He hired some people

847
00:47:14,431 --> 00:47:16,991
Problem but

848
00:47:17,247 --> 00:47:18,271
This is

849
00:47:19,295 --> 00:47:25,439
Yeah I don't know about that make him unfit for the

850
00:47:26,207 --> 00:47:32,351
Ultimately the president is going to be like synthesizing information brought to you from

851
00:47:32,607 --> 00:47:34,143
Different thing

852
00:47:34,399 --> 00:47:37,215
Huge numbers of advisers trying to chart out the bath

853
00:47:37,983 --> 00:47:39,519
The best effort

854
00:47:40,543 --> 00:47:44,383
The ability to hire people and listen to them seems like

855
00:47:51,551 --> 00:47:52,319
Yeah

856
00:47:52,575 --> 00:47:53,599
You're an executive

857
00:47:55,135 --> 00:47:58,719
The delegate and be able to hire competent people and have

858
00:47:59,231 --> 00:48:01,023
Things on that front and it's clear that

859
00:48:01,279 --> 00:48:04,351
Trump's f****** doesn't know even by Alex's own metrics

860
00:48:04,607 --> 00:48:05,119
Some standards

861
00:48:08,703 --> 00:48:11,775
Excuse of everyone around him is a coward as bad

862
00:48:12,031 --> 00:48:17,151
Cuz like if if someone were trying to have like an actual conversation about

863
00:48:17,407 --> 00:48:18,431
Pros and cons

864
00:48:18,687 --> 00:48:20,223
Of the Obama Administration

865
00:48:20,479 --> 00:48:23,295
He wanted to talk about like

866
00:48:23,807 --> 00:48:29,439
And someone is like Obama's great guy you just hired and surrounded himself with cowards

867
00:48:30,719 --> 00:48:32,255
Excuse for anything

868
00:48:32,511 --> 00:48:35,583
You can't use that as some kind of actual

869
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:38,399
Defense

870
00:48:43,007 --> 00:48:46,591
Call outside of your control whenever

871
00:48:48,383 --> 00:48:50,175
On purpose

872
00:48:51,967 --> 00:48:52,735
Yeah

873
00:48:56,319 --> 00:48:57,343
No matter who uses

874
00:48:57,855 --> 00:49:01,439
Whether it's someone on the left or some other

875
00:49:01,695 --> 00:49:02,207
It's sir

876
00:49:02,975 --> 00:49:05,279
Handle

877
00:49:05,535 --> 00:49:08,095
Some people just like the basic topic

878
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:14,239
Really matter

879
00:49:14,495 --> 00:49:17,567
Virus

880
00:49:17,823 --> 00:49:18,591
And what happened

881
00:49:18,847 --> 00:49:20,383
It's the same stuff you've heard over and over again

882
00:49:22,943 --> 00:49:23,455
Some of the stuff

883
00:49:23,711 --> 00:49:24,223
Kind of

884
00:49:24,479 --> 00:49:24,991
Newest

885
00:49:27,295 --> 00:49:30,623
His conception of what he wants to happen in the world

886
00:49:31,135 --> 00:49:32,415
Basically he wants to

887
00:49:32,671 --> 00:49:34,207
Power the developing world

888
00:49:34,719 --> 00:49:36,767
In order for them to rise up

889
00:49:37,279 --> 00:49:38,303
Because he believes

890
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:39,583
Will have

891
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:41,631
Equal effect on rising up

892
00:49:41,887 --> 00:49:42,911
The developed world

893
00:49:43,167 --> 00:49:44,191
The first world

894
00:49:44,703 --> 00:49:46,239
And this is silly

895
00:49:46,751 --> 00:49:47,263
You don't want

896
00:49:47,775 --> 00:49:49,055
Third world

897
00:49:49,567 --> 00:49:50,335
First world

898
00:49:55,455 --> 00:49:55,967
Our

899
00:49:56,223 --> 00:49:56,735
The third world

900
00:49:59,039 --> 00:50:00,319
Global Systems for setup

901
00:50:00,575 --> 00:50:01,599
Is about destroying

902
00:50:03,135 --> 00:50:03,647
Third world

903
00:50:04,159 --> 00:50:04,671
First world

904
00:50:05,951 --> 00:50:06,719
Because if we really

905
00:50:06,975 --> 00:50:07,487
Empower

906
00:50:07,743 --> 00:50:08,255
Third world

907
00:50:09,535 --> 00:50:10,303
First world

908
00:50:11,583 --> 00:50:12,095
Go offworld

909
00:50:12,607 --> 00:50:13,119
Okay

910
00:50:13,887 --> 00:50:14,655
So

911
00:50:15,423 --> 00:50:21,567
Removing everybody upload world

912
00:50:21,823 --> 00:50:22,335
Squirrel

913
00:50:22,847 --> 00:50:23,615
Yeah

914
00:50:24,383 --> 00:50:27,711
That's the type 1 civilization

915
00:50:27,967 --> 00:50:32,319
In Alex's idea I guess

916
00:50:32,575 --> 00:50:37,183
Is Janelle Wilson

917
00:50:38,207 --> 00:50:41,535
Do you know where first world developed World 2

918
00:50:41,791 --> 00:50:43,839
Sure

919
00:50:45,887 --> 00:50:51,263
We're at the highest I don't think that's a good model

920
00:50:54,335 --> 00:50:57,151
SeaWorld

921
00:51:02,271 --> 00:51:08,415
What is that I mean isn't that like kind of Elysium

922
00:51:08,671 --> 00:51:13,023
Planets

923
00:51:13,535 --> 00:51:16,095
Listen I still want them to be

924
00:51:16,351 --> 00:51:17,375
Don't get me wrong

925
00:51:17,887 --> 00:51:24,031
I don't I don't I don't I don't see I don't see how this works in any real-world application

926
00:51:24,287 --> 00:51:24,799
Whorehouse

927
00:51:25,567 --> 00:51:29,151
It's nice I don't feel like it's a good path forward we're going to need to see the paperwork on the

928
00:51:30,431 --> 00:51:31,199
Before we can really do

929
00:51:31,455 --> 00:51:37,343
Decide now I do agree with Alex that we should empower the developing world and help

930
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:38,623
So good on

931
00:51:40,159 --> 00:51:42,463
Different versions of what that means

932
00:51:48,095 --> 00:51:51,423
And we'll all go to the Stars

933
00:51:51,679 --> 00:51:53,983
I'm enforcing the class system

934
00:51:54,239 --> 00:51:55,519
100%

935
00:51:57,055 --> 00:52:00,895
Because we know Alex

936
00:52:01,407 --> 00:52:02,431
Andweknow

937
00:52:03,455 --> 00:52:03,967
People

938
00:52:08,831 --> 00:52:09,599
Some agreement

939
00:52:09,855 --> 00:52:12,159
And that may be the best place for white people is

940
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:16,255
Awesome he doesn't want like China to go space

941
00:52:19,839 --> 00:52:20,351
Anyway

942
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:24,959
Developing world

943
00:52:25,215 --> 00:52:26,239
2

944
00:52:26,495 --> 00:52:27,775
You know

945
00:52:28,287 --> 00:52:34,431
Aspire to develop World status or something

946
00:52:35,711 --> 00:52:36,479
The f****** threat

947
00:52:43,903 --> 00:52:44,415
All sorts of

948
00:52:47,231 --> 00:52:47,743
Call Pro ideas

949
00:52:49,023 --> 00:52:49,535
Colonies

950
00:52:57,471 --> 00:52:57,983
Is all done

951
00:52:59,007 --> 00:53:00,031
They don't want that

952
00:53:00,287 --> 00:53:00,799
Free will

953
00:53:03,103 --> 00:53:06,431
Globalist worried about people deciding

954
00:53:06,687 --> 00:53:07,199
To fly into

955
00:53:07,455 --> 00:53:08,479
The black hole

956
00:53:08,991 --> 00:53:09,759
Original out of space

957
00:53:12,831 --> 00:53:17,439
Yeah Alex might of Florida

958
00:53:18,463 --> 00:53:19,743
Might have gone

959
00:53:20,767 --> 00:53:21,791
Vanessa

960
00:53:25,631 --> 00:53:26,655
It is my feeling

961
00:53:26,911 --> 00:53:28,447
People were merging with

962
00:53:28,703 --> 00:53:31,007
Machines of their own free will Alex

963
00:53:31,263 --> 00:53:33,055
I'll be screaming about that

964
00:53:34,847 --> 00:53:36,639
There's no way that that could happen

965
00:53:37,151 --> 00:53:40,223
And Alex believe it's free well-to-do

966
00:53:40,991 --> 00:53:44,575
Complete about that W think that's possible

967
00:53:45,343 --> 00:53:51,487
Studios all over the place

968
00:53:53,023 --> 00:53:57,375
Reply to Blackhawk spaghettification sounds fun

969
00:53:59,935 --> 00:54:05,567
We got to invest in a few and eventually

970
00:54:05,823 --> 00:54:06,591
Futures week

971
00:54:07,103 --> 00:54:09,663
I assume they're worse

972
00:54:09,919 --> 00:54:14,015
I am going to fly into a black hole

973
00:54:20,159 --> 00:54:23,743
Blackhawk

974
00:54:23,999 --> 00:54:27,583
Elon Musk

975
00:54:27,839 --> 00:54:28,351
Texas

976
00:54:29,119 --> 00:54:30,399
My backyard

977
00:54:30,911 --> 00:54:35,263
Aggravated an einstein-rosen Bridge

978
00:54:36,031 --> 00:54:38,847
How beautiful you wonder why these people talking about

979
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:40,383
Elon Musk

980
00:54:40,639 --> 00:54:41,663
Building an X-Wing

981
00:54:41,919 --> 00:54:44,991
And Joe Rogan is going to Captain

982
00:54:45,247 --> 00:54:47,551
Because you drunk

983
00:54:51,391 --> 00:54:57,535
Certainly not being Joe Rogan podcast it will be the highest

984
00:54:57,791 --> 00:55:02,399
All time

985
00:55:02,911 --> 00:55:03,935
Along with your pool

986
00:55:04,191 --> 00:55:08,031
He will be existing in the singularity

987
00:55:17,247 --> 00:55:22,879
So Alex has one last reports inside

988
00:55:23,135 --> 00:55:25,439
This special report a box in a box

989
00:55:30,815 --> 00:55:32,863
It's Alex taking issue with Joe Biden

990
00:55:33,887 --> 00:55:34,655
Which is fine

991
00:55:35,935 --> 00:55:37,727
Apparently Charlamagne Tha God

992
00:55:38,239 --> 00:55:38,751
The radio house

993
00:55:39,007 --> 00:55:39,519
Sure

994
00:55:39,775 --> 00:55:40,543
As

995
00:55:40,799 --> 00:55:41,311
ComEd

996
00:55:41,567 --> 00:55:42,591
And it's interesting because

997
00:55:43,103 --> 00:55:43,871
I have a critique

998
00:55:44,895 --> 00:55:46,431
What Joe Biden

999
00:55:46,687 --> 00:55:48,479
Sad

1000
00:55:48,735 --> 00:55:51,039
Critiquing

1001
00:55:51,295 --> 00:55:52,319
1

1002
00:55:52,575 --> 00:55:53,855
I think I can't wait to add a take

1003
00:55:54,367 --> 00:55:54,879
Joe Biden

1004
00:55:55,647 --> 00:55:56,671
You don't vote for

1005
00:55:57,951 --> 00:55:58,463
Charlemagne

1006
00:56:06,143 --> 00:56:06,655
Shut the

1007
00:56:08,191 --> 00:56:08,959
First races

1008
00:56:09,215 --> 00:56:09,983
President Lamar

1009
00:56:13,823 --> 00:56:14,591
BFF / 1st

1010
00:56:18,431 --> 00:56:19,199
First racist

1011
00:56:20,991 --> 00:56:21,503
Obviously

1012
00:56:22,527 --> 00:56:23,039
It's obvious

1013
00:56:27,135 --> 00:56:27,647
Occult

1014
00:56:28,415 --> 00:56:29,183
And this is what Joe Biden

1015
00:56:29,951 --> 00:56:33,791
He doesn't really Analyze This any further or like what his complaint is

1016
00:56:37,631 --> 00:56:38,911
Bunch of presidents had slaves

1017
00:56:39,167 --> 00:56:41,215
Ridiculous

1018
00:56:41,471 --> 00:56:43,263
And that would be my

1019
00:56:43,519 --> 00:56:44,799
Could be like now there have been

1020
00:56:45,055 --> 00:56:46,335
Plenty of races president

1021
00:56:46,591 --> 00:56:48,127
In our history

1022
00:56:49,151 --> 00:56:54,015
Seems like that would be more invested in Trump isn't racist

1023
00:56:57,087 --> 00:56:59,391
I don't know what

1024
00:56:59,647 --> 00:57:00,671
He's taking issue with

1025
00:57:00,927 --> 00:57:02,207
Can't possibly be that like

1026
00:57:02,463 --> 00:57:03,231
No

1027
00:57:04,255 --> 00:57:06,303
Most of the presidents

1028
00:57:06,815 --> 00:57:10,911
I doubt he's going to be like in Wilson

1029
00:57:12,959 --> 00:57:16,287
Several viewings of birth of the nation

1030
00:57:20,383 --> 00:57:24,479
You could even say you could even be like well Trump isn't as racist as Wilson

1031
00:57:24,735 --> 00:57:26,015
And you'd probably be right

1032
00:57:26,527 --> 00:57:32,671
Alex in the argument that there isn't a racist past in America

1033
00:57:33,183 --> 00:57:34,207
Those are our country

1034
00:57:34,463 --> 00:57:35,231
Don't have

1035
00:57:35,743 --> 00:57:38,815
Overwhelming racists features

1036
00:57:39,071 --> 00:57:40,863
Do you know if your

1037
00:57:41,375 --> 00:57:42,911
Coming at this

1038
00:57:43,167 --> 00:57:45,727
Comment from the perspective of looking

1039
00:57:45,983 --> 00:57:46,495
Wilson

1040
00:57:49,567 --> 00:57:52,639
Because he opens up a larger conversation

1041
00:57:52,895 --> 00:57:55,711
A bunch of our presidents have been

1042
00:57:55,967 --> 00:57:58,271
Big old racist

1043
00:57:58,783 --> 00:58:04,927
His ability to be like America's great. Granted we haven't been the best all the time

1044
00:58:05,951 --> 00:58:08,767
Facade

1045
00:58:09,279 --> 00:58:10,303
So I think

1046
00:58:10,559 --> 00:58:12,863
From everything I can tell his response would be

1047
00:58:13,119 --> 00:58:16,447
Trump isn't racist stupid

1048
00:58:16,703 --> 00:58:19,007
Because the alternative

1049
00:58:19,263 --> 00:58:21,311
You and I would have or Charlamagne has

1050
00:58:21,567 --> 00:58:26,943
Or any right-thinking person right that's too threatening to that Alex has

1051
00:58:27,199 --> 00:58:28,991
Obvious way to go home

1052
00:58:29,247 --> 00:58:30,527
And if he doesn't

1053
00:58:30,783 --> 00:58:34,879
If he doesn't follow a lot I like if he follows this threatening doesn't go the obvious

1054
00:58:35,135 --> 00:58:37,183
Very annoyed

1055
00:58:37,439 --> 00:58:38,207
And also

1056
00:58:40,511 --> 00:58:41,279
But the obvious thing

1057
00:58:41,535 --> 00:58:42,047
To say is

1058
00:58:42,303 --> 00:58:42,815
Obama

1059
00:58:44,351 --> 00:58:46,911
That's the way he has to go right

1060
00:58:47,167 --> 00:58:53,311
Obama's our first racist president that's the way you do it all narratives flow from there

1061
00:58:53,567 --> 00:58:56,383
Definitely heard some people say that

1062
00:58:56,895 --> 00:58:58,687
Yeah I don't I don't I don't know Alex doesn't

1063
00:58:59,711 --> 00:59:01,759
He doesn't impact Us in any way that I find

1064
00:59:02,271 --> 00:59:03,807
Meaning Fuller actual like I don't

1065
00:59:04,319 --> 00:59:05,343
Don't say more about it

1066
00:59:05,599 --> 00:59:06,623
I think that's

1067
00:59:07,135 --> 00:59:07,647
That's fun

1068
00:59:07,903 --> 00:59:11,743
Whenever like people can come at a comment from

1069
00:59:12,511 --> 00:59:17,375
Disapproving positions would be completely a disagreement

1070
00:59:17,887 --> 00:59:18,911
Brilliant Earth

1071
00:59:20,959 --> 00:59:21,471
Not my friend

1072
00:59:26,591 --> 00:59:27,871
Call f*** is wrong with you

1073
00:59:28,383 --> 00:59:30,431
My enemy is trying to get off world right now

1074
00:59:30,687 --> 00:59:31,199
Yeah

1075
00:59:31,455 --> 00:59:36,319
Because this is like

1076
00:59:36,575 --> 00:59:40,671
A short report and a lot of it is like I said very repetitious

1077
00:59:41,951 --> 00:59:43,487
Alex has been out of studio for a week

1078
00:59:43,743 --> 00:59:45,279
And it's important

1079
00:59:45,535 --> 00:59:49,375
To me to check in on when it comes back

1080
00:59:51,935 --> 00:59:52,447
Bumbling

1081
00:59:52,959 --> 00:59:53,983
East Bumble card

1082
00:59:55,263 --> 00:59:55,775
I think it's a disaster

1083
00:59:56,031 --> 00:59:56,799
I think it's lame

1084
00:59:57,567 --> 00:59:58,335
Indicative of

1085
00:59:58,591 --> 00:59:59,615
More trouble ahead

1086
00:59:59,871 --> 01:00:01,663
Yeah I don't think he has anywhere to go

1087
01:00:01,919 --> 01:00:02,431
Like

1088
01:00:04,479 --> 01:00:04,991
Trump

1089
01:00:05,503 --> 01:00:06,783
Endorses a vaccine

1090
01:00:07,039 --> 01:00:08,319
If it gets

1091
01:00:08,831 --> 01:00:09,599
SeaWorld

1092
01:00:09,855 --> 01:00:10,367
Scenario

1093
01:00:10,879 --> 01:00:13,439
Becomes available in October

1094
01:00:15,999 --> 01:00:17,535
What is Alex do

1095
01:00:17,791 --> 01:00:18,815
I don't know

1096
01:00:19,071 --> 01:00:22,399
Himself on fire like a Vietnamese monk does eBay alarm Trump

1097
01:00:22,655 --> 01:00:28,287
Month before the election throws for behind bike

1098
01:00:28,799 --> 01:00:31,103
I don't see how we could do that

1099
01:00:31,359 --> 01:00:31,871
Respond though

1100
01:00:32,127 --> 01:00:34,175
Like support Trump for

1101
01:00:36,735 --> 01:00:38,527
Functionally that's supporting by

1102
01:00:39,039 --> 01:00:40,575
Like what do you do

1103
01:00:40,831 --> 01:00:42,111
Okay so here's what I would do

1104
01:00:42,623 --> 01:00:43,647
Nothing

1105
01:00:44,159 --> 01:00:45,439
Sarcastic

1106
01:00:46,207 --> 01:00:48,255
0 positive coverage

1107
01:00:48,511 --> 01:00:49,023
Trump

1108
01:00:49,279 --> 01:00:50,047
0 coverage of

1109
01:00:50,303 --> 01:00:50,815
Trump at all

1110
01:00:51,327 --> 01:00:52,607
Only say

1111
01:00:52,863 --> 01:00:53,887
Things about Biden

1112
01:00:54,143 --> 01:00:55,423
As if you are supporting

1113
01:00:55,935 --> 01:00:58,239
Satire

1114
01:00:58,495 --> 01:01:03,103
I Love the Way by tonight and then just do it to piss off the lives by pointing out all the s*** that

1115
01:01:03,359 --> 01:01:05,407
Does that you actually do agree with

1116
01:01:05,663 --> 01:01:11,807
Like we like cuz he always loves

1117
01:01:12,063 --> 01:01:16,415
Call my money

1118
01:01:16,671 --> 01:01:17,951
That's alright

1119
01:01:20,511 --> 01:01:23,839
1

1120
01:01:24,095 --> 01:01:30,239
Everybody bro

1121
01:01:35,359 --> 01:01:40,735
What's happening right now is not working for me to go

1122
01:01:41,503 --> 01:01:43,039
And I really would like to yell about Hillary to

1123
01:01:43,295 --> 01:01:45,087
The please run third-party

1124
01:01:45,343 --> 01:01:45,855
Love it

1125
01:01:46,111 --> 01:01:47,903
Hillary Michelle Obama ticket

1126
01:01:48,159 --> 01:01:51,487
I will yell about it everybody have a good time

1127
01:01:51,743 --> 01:01:52,255
Or

1128
01:01:52,511 --> 01:01:53,279
Second option

1129
01:01:54,047 --> 01:02:00,191
Electoral politics

1130
01:02:00,447 --> 01:02:05,567
Go to the store

1131
01:02:07,359 --> 01:02:13,503
The country nationalism is all over there

1132
01:02:13,759 --> 01:02:15,551
Infowars is a lot of fun

1133
01:02:15,807 --> 01:02:17,599
You started by talking about

1134
01:02:17,855 --> 01:02:18,879
Federal Reserve

1135
01:02:20,159 --> 01:02:24,255
Read a book

1136
01:02:24,511 --> 01:02:26,303
And I have not write it I don't know what

1137
01:02:26,815 --> 01:02:27,583
Talking about

1138
01:02:27,839 --> 01:02:33,471
I just heard W Cleon skousen

1139
01:02:33,727 --> 01:02:34,495
I thought it a career on it

1140
01:02:34,751 --> 01:02:35,775
We got a lot of fun

1141
01:02:37,311 --> 01:02:40,895
911

1142
01:02:41,407 --> 01:02:46,015
This is a spice called now

1143
01:02:48,319 --> 01:02:53,951
It had pivot right but I don't know how to tell you this but there is nothing left for me in the world of politics

1144
01:02:54,207 --> 01:02:59,071
I've clearly been transitioning into being a cult leader and now we need to go

1145
01:03:01,375 --> 01:03:03,423
Let's do this baby

1146
01:03:04,191 --> 01:03:05,471
That's the only other option I think

1147
01:03:05,983 --> 01:03:07,775
And good luck with the foundation

1148
01:03:08,799 --> 01:03:09,567
Discover Anouk

1149
01:03:10,847 --> 01:03:14,431
If they discover a new Comet that's going to be

1150
01:03:14,687 --> 01:03:20,575
Because we've seen how dangerous I can be and how destructive it is and I

1151
01:03:23,391 --> 01:03:26,207
I apologize if this is a little bit disappointing

1152
01:03:26,463 --> 01:03:28,511
We'll see what happens if Alex gets bacon

1153
01:03:28,767 --> 01:03:29,791
Studio proper because

1154
01:03:30,047 --> 01:03:36,191
You know it's always a crapshoot whenever he does these special reports and these like these emergency Saturday episode

1155
01:03:36,703 --> 01:03:37,727
Cuz sometimes

1156
01:03:37,983 --> 01:03:39,007
He can come in with the head

1157
01:03:39,263 --> 01:03:43,615
Steam ID could like really wow you could knock your socks off

1158
01:03:43,871 --> 01:03:48,479
He comes in he's not even trying and trying

1159
01:03:48,735 --> 01:03:52,831
I think that he knew that he had to give some kind of a front-facing

1160
01:03:53,087 --> 01:03:54,367
I don't approve of this Trump

1161
01:03:54,623 --> 01:03:59,231
I'm going to talk to you like a like a baby who's mad and change my finger

1162
01:03:59,487 --> 01:04:01,279
And I think that he just did that to do it

1163
01:04:02,559 --> 01:04:05,375
And we'll see if it carries over into his actual show that people watch

1164
01:04:05,887 --> 01:04:06,911
Cuz no one's watching this year

1165
01:04:09,727 --> 01:04:15,871
Everything about this seems just like you expect

1166
01:04:16,127 --> 01:04:18,175
This just needs to happen

1167
01:04:18,431 --> 01:04:19,455
Now where's Trump

1168
01:04:19,711 --> 01:04:25,855
Continue talking about masks. If he doesn't

1169
01:04:26,111 --> 01:04:26,623
Talking about masks

1170
01:04:26,879 --> 01:04:27,903
Then I guess you can

1171
01:04:28,159 --> 01:04:31,231
Globalist

1172
01:04:31,487 --> 01:04:32,255
He's playing 32 minutes

1173
01:04:32,511 --> 01:04:33,279
Chess pie

1174
01:04:33,535 --> 01:04:35,839
Listening to me in private and then he

1175
01:04:36,095 --> 01:04:40,447
Kowtowing but eventually comes it'll only kill our enemies

1176
01:04:41,727 --> 01:04:42,495
Get the vaccine

1177
01:04:42,751 --> 01:04:44,799
We'll see what happens

1178
01:04:45,055 --> 01:04:46,335
But yeah

1179
01:04:47,615 --> 01:04:48,639
Has been has been

1180
01:04:52,991 --> 01:04:54,271
Next time

1181
01:04:55,807 --> 01:04:56,575
We do have a website

1182
01:04:56,831 --> 01:05:01,951
It's not right that comment Bros on Twitter

1183
01:05:02,207 --> 01:05:08,095
We are visitors at 100 then if you could please find a local charity in your area or bail funds

1184
01:05:08,351 --> 01:05:08,863
How people are doing

1185
01:05:15,775 --> 01:05:17,311
What would you call it

1186
01:05:18,079 --> 01:05:19,359
The chair of the

1187
01:05:19,615 --> 01:05:22,431
Human defenses call the person in charge of a foundation

1188
01:05:22,687 --> 01:05:23,199
I like German

1189
01:05:23,455 --> 01:05:24,479
Sure

1190
01:05:24,735 --> 01:05:26,015
The human Defense League

1191
01:05:27,039 --> 01:05:29,087
Thanks for holding

1192
01:05:31,391 --> 01:05:34,975
Alex
