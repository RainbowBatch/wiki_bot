5
00:00:15,616 --> 00:00:18,176
Doing some stand-up comedy

6
00:00:18,432 --> 00:00:19,200
Compact

7
00:00:19,712 --> 00:00:25,600
In order to get the studio and recorded episode

8
00:00:27,392 --> 00:00:29,184
Thrilled to welcome back

9
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:31,232

He loves right

12
00:00:35,328 --> 00:00:35,840
That's about it

13
00:00:39,424 --> 00:00:40,960
Oh you're from Indiana

14
00:00:41,216 --> 00:00:45,312
Obsession with treehouses as a child

15
00:00:45,568 --> 00:00:51,200
Did you always want to break into people's houses or climb up to

16
00:00:51,456 --> 00:00:57,600
Flashlight on

17
00:00:57,856 --> 00:01:00,416
Wrestling

00:01:00,672 --> 00:01:06,816
Hurricanrana achiever

19
00:01:07,328 --> 00:01:09,632
Each one better than the last

20
00:01:17,312 --> 00:01:17,824
Interesting

21
00:01:20,896 --> 00:01:23,200

25
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:38,304
Oh you a week before we started recording

26
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:39,840

5-day growth or something

29
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,176
He is the one he has that face that it looks like if

30
00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:55,968
Dead an old-timey like

31
00:01:56,224 --> 00:01:57,248
Hobo

32
00:01:57,504 --> 00:02:00,064
Like he's like a little cigar

33
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:04,672
Sure canal

34
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:05,440
He just looks like

35
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:09,536
Trainwreck

36
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:12,352
Go home and tell your mother you're brilliant

37
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:15,680
Someone on their mate a good comment

00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:16,448
Detransition

39
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:18,496
Into being a bald guy with a goatee

40
00:02:18,752 --> 00:02:21,568
Like a cool ball

41
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:22,336
At least I have

42
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:27,968
I think I probably actually like high school cuz I used to shave my head and I School

43
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,392
The widow's peak

44
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:44,352
Thursday stuff in the back of my head

45
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:45,120

Yeah yeah that was pathetic

56
00:03:15,584 --> 00:03:16,352
For that you could bring up

57
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:24,544
Everyone suck.

58
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:30,176
Anyway it's about Alex Jones talking about qanon steps

59
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:31,456
But anyway anybody

60
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:32,224
Alex

00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:33,248
My friend

00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:37,856
I love you you love Alex Jones

63
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:44,256
I probably loves a comic

64
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:48,864
I can't think of a specific example and if I could name the but like

65
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,424
I probably met comedians at festivals

66
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,496
That I haven't seen in years but I think

67
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:56,544
I love that person

68
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,360
XYZ they have a show where there

69
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:00,640
Racist

70
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:09,600
Isn't cool to me that's my favorite

71
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:11,648
Isaac comedy turned is probably in every

72
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,440
Every branch of life

73
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:15,232
They've all been cool to me

74
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:21,887
Alex that's how we

75
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:23,935
I hate that

76
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:25,215
It's so bad

77
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:26,751
So, that person has

78
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:28,543
I don't know

79
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:32,639
Other people's experiences are secondhand

80
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:39,807
Rick was friends with the Toby

81
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:41,599
Pennywise

82
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:47,999
Oktoba always

83
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:50,815
No no

84
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:55,423
It's something that is almost not to be believed

85
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:56,447
Quite frankly

86
00:04:56,959 --> 00:05:00,799
A little bit to talk to you

87
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:02,079
Because

88
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:06,943
Not like

89
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:09,247
Medicine

90
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:14,111
Not not like rake but like the nature of the heel

91
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:21,535
AMV how it be harder story to tell

92
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:26,143
Is a face you can correct me if I'm wrong

93
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:30,495
Relies on sort of natural charisma

94
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:33,567
Amplifying natural Charisma to get people to like you

95
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:36,127
To get them like the crowd to want to see

96
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:39,967
This person defeat the heel

97
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:42,527
Really specific buttons

98
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:46,367
That they wouldn't probably make people feel

99
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:52,767
People who played goals in order to

100
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:56,351
Right trigger the audience

101
00:05:56,863 --> 00:05:58,911
I meant also the other aspect of it

102
00:05:59,423 --> 00:06:01,983
Playing against

103
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:03,519
And then also I think it's a more

104
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:05,055
Compelling narrative thing

105
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:08,383
Because it allows for Redemption narrative

106
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:10,943
Heroic can only be like

107
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:17,087
Well I don't like them as much as I used to wear is coming out of the whole being

108
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:18,623
Coming up to like

109
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:20,415
Now we like you

110
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:25,535
Yeah I think it's I think it's much more interesting a much more difficult I don't know

111
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:30,911
I've never seen you take notes on this box

112
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:31,935
It's it's

113
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:33,727
Very hard

114
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:34,751
To have

115
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:36,799
As healed

116
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:37,823
The bad guys

117
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:42,431
Or

118
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:44,479
So

119
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:45,503
Back in the day

120
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:47,039
It was Hulk Hogan was

121
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:48,063
The good guy

122
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:49,343
Chirp

123
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:50,623
Sergeant Slaughter

124
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:52,671
Or the chic

125
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:54,207
So that was

126
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:54,975
Well Define

127
00:06:55,487 --> 00:06:56,255
But

128
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:57,535
Somewhere along the way

129
00:06:58,047 --> 00:06:59,071
We started getting it

130
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:01,119
The attitude

131
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:04,959
You had what was kind of called

132
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:07,007
Right

133
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:09,567
Yeah but not this happened back in the day because

134
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:11,103
With the four horsemen

135
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:14,431
Safid watch old NWA old school world

136
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:15,455

There would be guys

138
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:19,551

00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:21,855
Dusty Rhodes start getting

140
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:24,927
Hogan

141
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:29,023
What are the things that led to it was

142
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:30,047
The good guy

143
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:35,423
I'll be your partner insurance

144
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:40,543

00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:45,919
Team up with the

00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:46,943

00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:50,527
But with the cool heal

148
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:54,111
The bad guys

149
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:55,647
And

150
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:56,415
They

151
00:07:56,927 --> 00:07:58,207

This hillbilly company

154
00:08:04,095 --> 00:08:05,631

Reasons

185
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:24,479
It's been like the perfect storm of bad reason

00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:25,503
Or bad

187
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:26,527
Happenstance

188
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:28,063
This guy is kind of like Murphy's Law Office

Stop wearing diapers

00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:50,079
Nope he's the guy

198
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:52,639
I do like

199
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:57,247
I always do whatever I want whenever I want

200
00:09:57,503 --> 00:09:58,015
Like he's cocky

201
00:09:58,271 --> 00:10:01,599
I like actually told you some bread

202
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:05,183
Opposed to

203
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:06,463
Turned out to be

204
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:11,327
The correct on which I really like John Cena back

205
00:10:13,887 --> 00:10:14,655
Shouldn't like him

206
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:21,055
Everyone was Elias when he first showed up this is awesome

207
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:27,455
There's some guys who just for the main roster and alliances one

208
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:31,295
Nope this guy sucks I like

209
00:10:32,575 --> 00:10:34,879
You shut your mouth I can be

210
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:38,463
Turn on my decisions the right way

211
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:40,767
Eliason

212
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:41,791
Directions

213
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:44,095
I got to get better in the rain but otherwise he

214
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:44,863
He is a guy

215
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:47,423
True deal

216
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:48,447
Bush Lake

217
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:49,727
Exactly

218
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:51,263
And it to be a good heel

219
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:52,031
A lot of times

220
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:55,103
You eventually have to

221
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:56,639
Get your come up

222
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:57,663
It's a lot of people.

223
00:10:57,919 --> 00:10:58,431
Stephanie McMahon

224
00:10:59,199 --> 00:10:59,967
She's a heel

225
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:00,991
But she never gets her

226
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:08,415
But then she was on TV couple weeks later than

227
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:10,975
Broken broken

228
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:12,255
Need the window dressing

229
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:13,535
Yeah

230
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:17,887
I'm sorry I'm just one of those things

231
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:19,167
Hero long enough

232
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:20,191
Villain

233
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:21,727
There are

234
00:11:21,983 --> 00:11:23,007
Like tanahashi in Japan

235
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:27,103
Everwild

236
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:27,871
Okada was the

237
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:31,711
It just happened

238
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:34,783
I can see that

239
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:42,975
I think a lot of people

240
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:49,375
For life to be a lot like wrestling so that like you know the bad guy having a reception like

241
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:50,655
A lot of people ask me about

242
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:53,471
Do you think there was any point where it's possible for Alex

243
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:54,495
Teturn face

244
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:57,567
Window

245
00:11:57,823 --> 00:12:02,943
I don't I think from what I've gleaned from studying 2009 Isaac use white supremacy

246
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:08,319
I think there's a lot of things that people miss

247
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:13,183
How is language

248
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:14,719
His his relationship

249
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:15,999
Black people

250
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:17,791
Clearly oh boy

251
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:18,815
There's been some

252
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:24,191
I bet anymore like I'm the victim of that when I was a kid

253
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:25,215
Cup

254
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:30,079
Maybe it was covid-19

255
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:32,639
Bye-bye

256
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:33,407
1

257
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:34,431
Black eye

258
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:35,455
Beat up like Alex

259
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:36,991
Three or two of his friend

260
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:38,015
And they ran away

261
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:43,135
If possible

262
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:45,183
Rockwall Texas

263
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:48,511
I looked it up now

264
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:50,559
But he grew up there in the 70s

265
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:54,399
1970 census population was 3100 people

266
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:56,959
Small suburb that probably was

267
00:12:57,215 --> 00:13:01,055
You know formulaic houses mcmansion type

268
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:03,103
Sure people didn't want to leave

269
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:06,943
Because the population was too high to Urban that's my guess

270
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:14,623
Punch the walls

271
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:19,743
Fabulous Motley Crue

272
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:26,143
That privilege with listen to Oliver episode that is a real status a real talk about showing how tough they are

273
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:32,543
Adult

274
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:35,871
Drunk we chop each other

275
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:40,991
Who are your top five

276
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:42,015
Of all time

277
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:45,599
Emma WWE era

278
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:51,999

279
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:58,399
The Ric Flair Starbucks

281
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:00,447

Olive Garden

285
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:05,567
I would set them down

286
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:07,103
They would shut down for one day

287
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:10,687
We would watch that Rodger Stone documentary

288
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:11,967
And we would just

289
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:13,503
This is the place

290
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:16,575
You guys are not playing by The Playbook some guys are

291
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:17,599

Sure you should be

299
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:37,055

When he was a bad guy

320
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:37,727
He

321
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:40,031
Became a chickenshit you can't be

Former four-time WWE Champion and I don't deserve

Rodger Stone everything codes

334
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:13,823
At the end of the day in wrestling what you want

335
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:14,591
You want

336
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:16,639
People to want to pay money

337
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:17,407
To see you

338
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:18,943
Forbes

339
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:20,479
So

341
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:24,063
Liquor store

Just make a Rodger Stone comparison

347
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:45,567

Okay Charlie Blanchard

351
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:56,063
Was one of the four horsemen

352
00:16:56,319 --> 00:16:57,343
Most known

353
00:16:57,855 --> 00:17:00,927
Protein partners with Arn Anderson

354
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:02,207
This was a guy

355
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:03,743
People

356
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:04,767
King Haiti

357
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:06,303
There's some guys in wrestling

358
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:07,071
Where

359
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:08,095
I forgot who

360
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:10,399

00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:15,519
Great trainer

364
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:16,543
Adam

365
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:18,079
He was telling Dolph Ziggler

366
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:20,895
Which is a move that the good guys

367
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:22,943
He even told me go

368
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:24,223
Don't worry about

369
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:25,759
Cuz people are going to

370
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:26,527
Always hate

371
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:28,575

People can hate

374
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:31,391
Tully Blanchard

375
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:32,415
Tango

376
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:33,951
No one ever was like

One day we want to really cheer him like

00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:42,911
No redeeming qualities total piece of garbage

379
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:46,239

Nowadays

435
00:20:03,455 --> 00:20:03,967

00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:08,063
Ryan

437
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:09,343
When people didn't know it

00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:12,415
Predetermined whatever you wanna call it

440
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:13,439
They thought it was real

441
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:15,999
And you know somebody would do something

442
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:21,375
They're making a lot of noise

443
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:23,167
When you know you're being a real bad

444
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:23,935
You're nothing

445
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:24,703
That's what

446
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:33,663
Yeah I can see the gears turning in your head because you can tell that there's an answer I hope you say

447
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:40,063

What's up cell

00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:50,976
Add to the list of a black guy beating up Alex

456
00:21:51,232 --> 00:21:53,792
Alex was also beaten up by a wrestler

457
00:21:54,048 --> 00:22:00,192
Probably about span of the Von Erichs back-in-the-day extended does he does bring up watching

458
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:05,824
Devon Erickson he was younger this was taken from episode where he

459
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:12,224
Because Zeb Colter

460
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:17,856
A piece of their character

461
00:22:19,136 --> 00:22:25,280
Yuri about that Republicans

462
00:22:25,536 --> 00:22:31,680
Running for Senate May I was a member of a member of the cabinet

463
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:32,448
That was one piece

464
00:22:32,704 --> 00:22:33,216
But

465
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:40,384
I want

466
00:22:41,408 --> 00:22:44,224
He talked about a bunch of other stuff mixed and noses like

467
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,504
This is

468
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:51,136
That was super exciting

469
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:58,304
Full force

470
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:12,128
I would love to say good luck but I know that you're a f****** stupid

471
00:23:12,384 --> 00:23:13,664
Unfortunate

472
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:15,200
Glam doll

473
00:23:23,392 --> 00:23:24,672
Jokerland

474
00:23:25,184 --> 00:23:31,328
Jack Swagger being sort of

475
00:23:32,352 --> 00:23:33,120
And he's like

476
00:23:33,632 --> 00:23:37,728
I remember when that was going on in wrestling and like Jack Swagger was not

477
00:23:37,984 --> 00:23:44,128
Like the main event the big bad guy of the

478
00:23:44,384 --> 00:23:46,688
Have you eaten

479
00:23:46,944 --> 00:23:51,296
Most of his character is about liking Alex

480
00:23:51,552 --> 00:23:53,344
Sure he was top of the middle

481
00:23:56,672 --> 00:23:59,232
Every night he goes out and get beat by a Mexican

482
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:03,072

Used to wrestle in Puerto Rico that was a bad guy Rico

489
00:24:16,384 --> 00:24:20,480
Bad timing

490
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:24,064
I remember the WWE put out a video

491
00:24:24,576 --> 00:24:25,600
Or maybe it was just

492
00:24:25,856 --> 00:24:28,160
Swagger and Colter put out a video where they're like

493
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:34,816

00:24:44,288 --> 00:24:46,336
He's in the independency wrestle for a WYD

On Eddie Edwards

507
00:25:04,512 --> 00:25:05,024

Chest opened up chat

509
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,888
Open up is fair and you supposed to hit the chair with

510
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,424
And that would

511
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:12,960
It would make a great big noise

512
00:25:16,544 --> 00:25:17,312
For whatever reason

513
00:25:17,568 --> 00:25:20,896
He didn't sign it outright and said he just hit him in the

514
00:25:21,408 --> 00:25:23,712

I mean no harm

533
00:26:10,304 --> 00:26:11,584
So

534
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:12,352
That's the deal

535
00:26:12,864 --> 00:26:13,888
Back in the day was like

536
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,192
Yeah man like there was a moment where

537
00:26:16,448 --> 00:26:17,728
Jesse Ventura

538
00:26:17,984 --> 00:26:18,496

00:26:19,008 --> 00:26:25,152
Let's light landfill

540
00:26:25,408 --> 00:26:26,944

00:26:37,952 --> 00:26:38,464
Later

544
00:26:40,256 --> 00:26:41,024
The bad timing

545
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:43,072

It's like a bad guy

551
00:26:53,824 --> 00:26:54,592
It's like I see you should

00:26:55,104 --> 00:26:55,616
He's right

553
00:26:55,872 --> 00:26:57,152

555
00:26:58,432 --> 00:26:59,200
You guys change the way you

556
00:26:59,456 --> 00:27:00,736
This is an army

557
00:27:00,992 --> 00:27:03,040
It's all it's all things I recall was that like

00:27:56,288 --> 00:27:57,056
Came in the rain

584
00:27:57,568 --> 00:27:58,336
All covered in

585
00:27:58,592 --> 00:28:01,408
Balaclava

586
00:28:01,664 --> 00:28:02,944

Fully covered

589
00:28:08,832 --> 00:28:09,856
And then after they choked out

590
00:28:10,112 --> 00:28:10,624
The Undertaker

591
00:28:11,904 --> 00:28:12,672
Carried his body

592
00:28:14,464 --> 00:28:14,976
You know

593
00:28:15,232 --> 00:28:15,744
Call in the middle

594
00:28:24,192 --> 00:28:30,336
I don't know if it is a thing I don't know

595
00:28:30,848 --> 00:28:34,176
I mean it's just a funeral procession I imagine

596
00:28:34,432 --> 00:28:35,200
And this was right after the

597
00:28:36,224 --> 00:28:37,248
77

598
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:38,784
Right after it happened

599
00:28:41,088 --> 00:28:43,904
Not repackage a

600
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:49,536

5 minutes

603
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,168
Secular talk

604
00:29:00,288 --> 00:29:01,312
Things I've ever found

00:29:01,568 --> 00:29:03,872

Was a surprise guest on Infowars

608
00:29:10,528 --> 00:29:11,808
And I'll let you deal with it

609
00:29:13,856 --> 00:29:16,160
Super exciting to have

610
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:19,232
Rowdy Roddy Piper on weathers today

611
00:29:19,488 --> 00:29:25,632

620
00:30:22,976 --> 00:30:25,536
But like if I like that

621
00:30:31,424 --> 00:30:36,032
Sure sure but some of the racial

622
00:30:36,544 --> 00:30:40,128
That's cuz

623
00:30:43,968 --> 00:30:45,760
Haircut

624
00:30:50,112 --> 00:30:51,136
That's terrible introduction

625
00:30:51,392 --> 00:30:57,536
All he does is say his real name and he's friends with Jesse Ventura

626
00:30:57,792 --> 00:31:03,936

00:31:20,832 --> 00:31:23,648
Historical accuracy

631

30 minutes of w at hotel a couple weekends ago

635
00:31:35,168 --> 00:31:36,192
It's like watching a message

636
00:31:36,448 --> 00:31:37,472
Sketch with no comedy

637
00:31:37,728 --> 00:31:42,592
It's so in love

638
00:31:42,848 --> 00:31:44,640
Yeah the woman playing

639
00:31:46,176 --> 00:31:46,944
It's so over the

640
00:31:48,992 --> 00:31:50,272
I will say

641
00:31:50,528 --> 00:31:52,320
I watched Any Given Sunday

642
00:31:53,344 --> 00:31:54,112
That's still hell.

643
00:31:54,368 --> 00:31:55,136
This was just

644
00:31:56,928 --> 00:31:57,952
Yeah it was

645
00:31:58,208 --> 00:31:58,976
I want

646
00:31:59,744 --> 00:32:03,840
I've never watched that it never never appear

647
00:32:04,096 --> 00:32:06,144
I've seen Any Given Sunday

648
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,704
Have not seen

649
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:09,472
I could see that

650
00:32:09,728 --> 00:32:10,240
I don't

651
00:32:10,496 --> 00:32:11,776
I don't I wanted to though

652
00:32:12,288 --> 00:32:14,592
There was that scene in there where where w

653
00:32:16,896 --> 00:32:17,408
Like lovable

654
00:32:18,176 --> 00:32:18,688
President

655
00:32:18,944 --> 00:32:25,088
Dufault turnout hides under the under the raincoat with Michelle Obama and stuff

656
00:32:25,344 --> 00:32:29,440
Responsible for millions of deaths

657
00:32:29,696 --> 00:32:30,976
Reveal some news

658
00:32:39,424 --> 00:32:45,568
Like he's going to unleash all the technology and healing machines

659
00:32:46,592 --> 00:32:50,176
But I got a bridge

660
00:32:51,968 --> 00:32:55,296
Had he died on the pretzel had choked on the Press

661
00:32:55,552 --> 00:32:56,320
Imagine

662
00:32:56,832 --> 00:32:58,368
Like who do you like Selena

663
00:32:58,624 --> 00:33:00,672
But it would have been like one of those things that just the reverse

664
00:33:01,184 --> 00:33:01,952
Superbikes

665
00:33:02,208 --> 00:33:02,720
No

666
00:33:03,232 --> 00:33:04,256
A joke

667
00:33:09,888 --> 00:33:10,400
Where

668
00:33:13,472 --> 00:33:13,984
President

669
00:33:14,496 --> 00:33:15,520
The worst

670
00:33:16,032 --> 00:33:17,568
I think the president of Selena

671
00:33:23,712 --> 00:33:28,064
Which rest in peace

672
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:33,952
Because I remember him is kind of like a boozer

673
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:40,352
Alright maybe that's not a good guy

674
00:33:40,608 --> 00:33:46,752
Is it the guy he's a guy who

675
00:33:47,008 --> 00:33:48,800
Wow

676
00:33:49,312 --> 00:33:49,824
Icing

677
00:33:50,336 --> 00:33:51,360
Annie's a wrestler

00:33:51,616 --> 00:33:55,200
So he's going to he's going to put himself out there for commotion

679
00:33:55,712 --> 00:33:56,736
He was had a podcast

680
00:33:58,784 --> 00:34:00,320

681
00:34:00,832 --> 00:34:01,344
Okay

682
00:34:02,112 --> 00:34:04,160
Podcast 2013

00:34:06,464 --> 00:34:07,488
Minnie died in 25th

684
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:19,520
There were comics in La who was bloodied up to him and he

686

The word Outlets do it

687
00:34:23,616 --> 00:34:29,504
You do some stand-up

688
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:30,272
He was like

689
00:34:30,528 --> 00:34:31,296
What what

690
00:34:31,552 --> 00:34:32,576
Let's do it

691
00:34:33,856 --> 00:34:36,160
Could have been cooler

692
00:34:36,416 --> 00:34:38,464
The Young Bucks talk about how

693
00:34:38,976 --> 00:34:40,256
Who are the most popular

694
00:34:40,768 --> 00:34:41,280
Independent

695
00:34:41,536 --> 00:34:42,048
Tag team

696
00:34:42,304 --> 00:34:42,816
Or wrestlers

697
00:34:43,584 --> 00:34:44,864
They talked about

698
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:45,632
Him

699
00:34:46,912 --> 00:34:47,424
Call Mandy

700
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:49,472
He was just like

701
00:34:49,728 --> 00:34:50,496
Hi

00:34:50,752 --> 00:34:51,264

Change their

705
00:34:54,848 --> 00:35:00,992
I was one of the things I was really weird I always had an image of him is kind of like maybe being a s*** head

706
00:35:01,248 --> 00:35:03,296
Maybe like someone was arrested a bunch of times

707
00:35:03,552 --> 00:35:05,600
No

708
00:35:05,856 --> 00:35:09,696
Maybe a hard life but a pretty good life like treated people pretty well

709
00:35:11,488 --> 00:35:15,584
I mean it's not super rare wrestling terms

710
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:21,984
You always get surprised by things like I just learned recently that Kurt Angle had a bunch of DUI

711
00:35:27,104 --> 00:35:27,616
Was that

712
00:35:28,128 --> 00:35:28,640
Able to leave

713
00:35:28,896 --> 00:35:29,408

717
00:35:37,856 --> 00:35:38,368
Wantable

718
00:35:42,208 --> 00:35:42,976
Control

719
00:35:43,232 --> 00:35:47,840
Oh yeah

720
00:35:48,096 --> 00:35:49,376
Matches with

721
00:35:49,632 --> 00:35:50,144
Eddie would get

722
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:50,912
Nepal

723
00:35:51,168 --> 00:35:51,680
Touch me

724
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:53,984

726
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:00,640

00:36:00,896 --> 00:36:05,248
So five

728
00:36:05,504 --> 00:36:06,272
Yo Kurt Angle you got to go

729
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,600
No I'm fine really

730
00:36:09,856 --> 00:36:10,368
Organelle

731
00:36:19,328 --> 00:36:21,888
Guerrero passed away

732
00:36:23,936 --> 00:36:30,080
I don't know a lot of these people personalized but the one here about General ER

733
00:36:35,456 --> 00:36:36,224
That's when you hear the

734
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,784
Weather good or bad about that

735
00:36:40,832 --> 00:36:41,856
The fight with Piper

736
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,160
Around the around the Border

737
00:36:45,184 --> 00:36:45,952
Sinusitis

738
00:36:47,232 --> 00:36:48,512
Stood up for the wrestlers

739
00:36:50,304 --> 00:36:51,328
When you watch there's like a

740
00:36:53,888 --> 00:36:55,424
Heated wind turbines

741
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:56,192
Ric Flair

742
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:57,472
Now

743
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:01,568
And I

744
00:37:01,824 --> 00:37:03,360
You can tell Piper wife

745
00:37:05,408 --> 00:37:10,016
Kimberly likes to swing by the Rodger Stone parallel

746
00:37:11,808 --> 00:37:12,576
But

747
00:37:15,904 --> 00:37:19,744
Yeah that kind of bums me out that he was on Infowars cuz you know you always kind of want to

748
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,816
Yeah

749
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:28,704
That's why I think so that Alex

750
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:29,984
Infowars

751
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:31,008
Has

752
00:37:31,776 --> 00:37:33,568
A weird thing where they can

753
00:37:35,104 --> 00:37:39,456
Or enough Ringo it looks legitimate enough

754
00:37:39,712 --> 00:37:41,248
It's big enough big enough

755
00:37:41,504 --> 00:37:42,016
You know you can

756
00:37:42,272 --> 00:37:44,064

Well he's wrong about everything

762
00:38:14,016 --> 00:38:14,784
You need to talk to you

00:39:11,104 --> 00:39:15,456
Reaganomics

778
00:39:18,528 --> 00:39:20,064
Pause the music

779
00:39:22,112 --> 00:39:24,160
3 conspiracies

780
00:39:24,416 --> 00:39:27,488
The movie is Dunn's it's taken on a life of its own

781
00:39:28,768 --> 00:39:32,352
Never gets old

782
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:44,384
What's going on

783
00:39:45,408 --> 00:39:51,552
I think that's fair I think it would be interesting perspectives like I didn't necessarily ever

784
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:55,136
Put two and two together that I haven't watched

785
00:39:55,392 --> 00:39:57,696
Collagen Stoned Out of My Mind

786
00:39:57,952 --> 00:40:01,280
I never put the pieces together

787
00:40:01,792 --> 00:40:07,424
Statement on consumerism artificial messages through

788
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:13,824
Advertising and never really put the pieces together as like a statement about Reaganomics

789
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:18,176
I think a lot of those I think this is going to be another era like

790
00:40:18,432 --> 00:40:18,944
B8es

791
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:19,712
Where

792
00:40:20,224 --> 00:40:21,760
A lot of stuff was about Reagan

793
00:40:22,528 --> 00:40:23,552
And there was that

794
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:28,160
Reagan's America

795
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:32,256
Like that movie there's a lot of movies kind of like that

796
00:40:32,512 --> 00:40:33,024
Where

797
00:40:34,816 --> 00:40:36,096
Now cuz I was like

798
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:38,144
Watching

799
00:40:39,936 --> 00:40:46,080
Do you mean movies or video

800
00:40:47,872 --> 00:40:50,176
Doughboy

801
00:40:50,688 --> 00:40:54,016
What are the things to do that I did hear guys

802
00:40:54,272 --> 00:40:55,296
From the UK

803
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:59,136
Yeah America's McMahon your movies

804
00:40:59,392 --> 00:40:59,904
Really

805
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:02,208
You can tell like

806
00:41:02,976 --> 00:41:04,768
All about Trump

807
00:41:05,024 --> 00:41:05,536
I'm sucking General

808
00:41:06,048 --> 00:41:07,072
There's a lot of political

809
00:41:07,328 --> 00:41:08,352
Are movies are real

810
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:19,104
Are you receiving those like I mean there's no genre videos that is just people react

811
00:41:21,152 --> 00:41:25,504
Someone in our f****** Facebook group and I'm sounding angry only because of the time I've wasted

812
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:31,904
Someone posted videos

813
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:34,976
Posted was Irish people watching Alex Jones

814
00:41:35,232 --> 00:41:41,376
And I was how quickly they saw through like what is going on here

815
00:41:48,032 --> 00:41:54,175
Them people outside of our primary culture are able to be like

816
00:41:54,431 --> 00:41:55,455
My God this is

817
00:42:02,111 --> 00:42:03,135
We don't we don't

818
00:42:03,903 --> 00:42:05,439
Recognized as easily

819
00:42:05,695 --> 00:42:09,279
I think you're totally right

820
00:42:09,535 --> 00:42:14,399
Holyshit

821
00:42:14,655 --> 00:42:15,423
Can be about

822
00:42:16,191 --> 00:42:17,983
Like I think art can reflect

823
00:42:18,751 --> 00:42:19,263
What's going on in

824
00:42:19,519 --> 00:42:20,031
Society

825
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:20,799
Set timer

826
00:42:24,383 --> 00:42:27,199
But then there is people over the head with it

827
00:42:30,271 --> 00:42:32,063
That would be the case of like

828
00:42:32,575 --> 00:42:35,391
That Snoop Dogg video where he puts a gun to

829
00:42:38,975 --> 00:42:44,607
Come on in Austin and Vince already did that but yeah there are those

830
00:42:46,911 --> 00:42:49,215
So that's a thing where it's like when it's 2

831
00:42:49,727 --> 00:42:51,007
Yeah it's like I like

832
00:42:51,263 --> 00:42:51,775
Maybe

833
00:42:52,543 --> 00:42:54,079
Reading later or watching later

834
00:42:55,871 --> 00:42:56,383
Supposed to be

835
00:42:57,407 --> 00:42:57,919
This person

836
00:43:00,735 --> 00:43:02,015
Like get it

837
00:43:02,271 --> 00:43:03,295
I'm Trump

838
00:43:03,551 --> 00:43:05,087
Yeah I know

839
00:43:07,135 --> 00:43:13,023
So far so good Piper

840
00:43:14,047 --> 00:43:14,559
That's like

841
00:43:14,815 --> 00:43:15,583
The first planet

842
00:43:16,095 --> 00:43:17,375
Which is about

843
00:43:19,679 --> 00:43:20,191
Then

844
00:43:20,703 --> 00:43:22,751
In the second Planet of the Apes

845
00:43:23,263 --> 00:43:27,615
Yeah I guess they don't really get to what happened until right

846
00:43:28,127 --> 00:43:32,735
Is where they have like the ape hippies getting rounded up and it's like

847
00:43:32,991 --> 00:43:35,551
Now we're getting a little too the first was so subtle

848
00:43:35,807 --> 00:43:40,927
And cool racism stuff like that

849
00:43:41,183 --> 00:43:43,231
Ahead with it

850
00:43:43,487 --> 00:43:44,255
The third one

851
00:43:45,023 --> 00:43:47,327
Which is where they go

852
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:48,351
Back in time

853
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:50,143
0 in Cornelius

854
00:43:50,399 --> 00:43:55,519
Time to the beginning of a monkey beginning of it all

855
00:43:55,775 --> 00:43:57,823
They had this Bay riot and everything

856
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:03,967
There's a documentary the documentary

857
00:44:04,479 --> 00:44:05,247
About

858
00:44:05,503 --> 00:44:06,271
All the time

859
00:44:06,783 --> 00:44:07,295
Is Wendy's

860
00:44:07,551 --> 00:44:08,319
Happy anniversary

861
00:44:08,831 --> 00:44:09,599
Of the original

862
00:44:11,903 --> 00:44:13,695
Was so good

863
00:44:14,207 --> 00:44:14,719
And

864
00:44:15,743 --> 00:44:16,255
Caesars

865
00:44:16,511 --> 00:44:17,023
Is like the new leader

866
00:44:18,815 --> 00:44:19,583
Now we

867
00:44:20,351 --> 00:44:20,863
Planet

868
00:44:23,167 --> 00:44:24,191
They said when they test

869
00:44:25,471 --> 00:44:26,495
They tested it in a

870
00:44:26,751 --> 00:44:27,263
Black

871
00:44:27,519 --> 00:44:29,055
Neighborhood and black

872
00:44:29,823 --> 00:44:30,335
Parade near me

873
00:44:31,871 --> 00:44:33,407
And they're like oh no this is

874
00:44:33,919 --> 00:44:34,431
House right

875
00:44:34,943 --> 00:44:35,967
So they recut it

876
00:44:36,223 --> 00:44:38,015
And of course they were denied a lot of money

877
00:44:41,087 --> 00:44:42,111
A close-up of

878
00:44:42,367 --> 00:44:43,135
Caesars eyes

879
00:44:43,391 --> 00:44:44,671
And they got the guy at the exit.

880
00:44:44,927 --> 00:44:45,439
Comeback Migos

881
00:44:45,951 --> 00:44:46,463
We're at

882
00:44:48,511 --> 00:44:49,023
But

883
00:44:49,535 --> 00:44:51,583
We can do this with humans also

884
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:52,863
Together

885
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:57,471
And we will share this planet

886
00:44:57,727 --> 00:45:01,311
Am I Batman that falls apart

887
00:45:01,567 --> 00:45:05,151
Clock yeah but it's like that thing of the difference of the first one

888
00:45:05,663 --> 00:45:06,431
Perfect prey

889
00:45:07,967 --> 00:45:10,783
Ape hippies like

890
00:45:11,039 --> 00:45:14,367
That's the same thing as like

891
00:45:14,623 --> 00:45:18,719
I still like all of them

892
00:45:19,231 --> 00:45:19,999
Mark Wahlberg

893
00:45:20,511 --> 00:45:21,791
I hope you're happy

894
00:45:22,047 --> 00:45:28,191
I walked I worked at a movie theater when they came out at the time it was our tradition

895
00:45:28,447 --> 00:45:30,239
We're underage

896
00:45:30,495 --> 00:45:33,055
It was one of the only ways we really have life

897
00:45:33,311 --> 00:45:37,151
Screen all of the movies

898
00:45:37,663 --> 00:45:43,807
Before they came out

899
00:45:44,063 --> 00:45:46,623
Get belt getting built

900
00:45:46,879 --> 00:45:47,647
If

901
00:45:48,159 --> 00:45:51,231
There was open theater anyone could sign up to watch it

902
00:45:51,487 --> 00:45:51,999
To make sure

903
00:45:52,255 --> 00:45:55,583
Directions to put it through where all of us

904
00:45:55,839 --> 00:46:01,983
Some of our managers were over 21 and so they buy us food and we just have parties

905
00:46:02,239 --> 00:46:07,871
Publix 1718 at the time

906
00:46:08,383 --> 00:46:09,407
Just getting drunk

907
00:46:09,663 --> 00:46:11,967
Pre-screening these movies about some bad

908
00:46:12,223 --> 00:46:18,367
Oh s*** the worst was Mark Wahlberg

909
00:46:19,135 --> 00:46:20,927
With Arnold Schwarzenegger

910
00:46:21,183 --> 00:46:22,463
We all almost like left

911
00:46:24,511 --> 00:46:26,815
But one of our managers Rick

912
00:46:27,071 --> 00:46:29,631
Watched

913
00:46:29,887 --> 00:46:31,679
Because he loved the old man video

914
00:46:31,935 --> 00:46:33,215
She was a little older

915
00:46:33,727 --> 00:46:35,775
Late 20's

916
00:46:36,799 --> 00:46:39,103
At that time

917
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:39,871
A-Team

918
00:46:40,127 --> 00:46:43,455
Who are all the girl drinking having a great time and then at the end

919
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:46,015
When Mark Wahlberg comes back

920
00:46:46,271 --> 00:46:50,879
Back to Monument Memorial

921
00:46:51,135 --> 00:46:57,279
I'd like if it's an ape's head of the building

922
00:46:57,535 --> 00:46:59,327
As soon as you see

923
00:46:59,583 --> 00:47:05,727

00:47:05,983 --> 00:47:12,127

Represent

927
00:47:23,391 --> 00:47:26,719
We already hated it but that was a bridge too far

928
00:47:27,743 --> 00:47:28,511
But

929
00:47:29,023 --> 00:47:29,535
Alright

930
00:47:29,791 --> 00:47:31,839

00:47:40,543 --> 00:47:45,663
Do they put someone over to help somebody

935
00:47:45,919 --> 00:47:46,431
God

936
00:47:47,199 --> 00:47:52,319
I feel like there's no way that couldn't have been defensive somehow whoever they choose to have the 8

937
00:47:52,831 --> 00:47:56,415
Oh God don't Vincent and Andrew Sobek

No Limit soldiers were in the wcws

941
00:48:12,799 --> 00:48:15,103
Was hanging around that was a fun thing where

942
00:48:16,639 --> 00:48:17,151
The bad guys

943
00:48:17,407 --> 00:48:18,175
Turn up

944
00:48:22,783 --> 00:48:28,415

I thought

948
00:48:35,583 --> 00:48:36,351
I didn't think he was

949
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:37,631
The world

950
00:48:38,143 --> 00:48:39,167

951
00:48:39,423 --> 00:48:40,703

952
00:48:41,983 --> 00:48:43,007

If that was a recording artist

959
00:48:56,831 --> 00:48:57,855
And then

960
00:48:58,111 --> 00:48:59,391
The opposition

961
00:48:59,647 --> 00:49:00,927

00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:16,031
Junior

969
00:49:16,287 --> 00:49:17,567
They got a song

970
00:49:20,895 --> 00:49:27,039
Cuz rap rap song is a part of their Feud with no limit soldiers

971
00:49:27,295 --> 00:49:30,111
Got over and the crowd loved

972
00:49:32,671 --> 00:49:38,815
Ended up being crazy

973
00:49:39,583 --> 00:49:41,119
Water park

974
00:49:41,375 --> 00:49:42,143
People are not

975
00:49:42,399 --> 00:49:43,423
Russell get paid

976
00:49:44,703 --> 00:49:45,215
Cheese

977
00:49:45,727 --> 00:49:47,263
So all this is to say that

978
00:49:47,775 --> 00:49:53,407
Rowdy Roddy Piper this is like my favorite and my worst topics

979
00:49:53,663 --> 00:49:54,431
Because then we just go

980
00:49:56,223 --> 00:49:59,807
I think that's when they hire

981
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:01,087
Respective

982
00:50:01,343 --> 00:50:01,855
Hot rod

983
00:50:02,111 --> 00:50:06,719
I think you can retain it because of like probably got tricked but

984
00:50:07,231 --> 00:50:07,743
He's kind of like

985
00:50:07,999 --> 00:50:13,375
Hey however I can get the word out I think you should save those judgments I think he's kind of stupid but at the same time

986
00:50:13,887 --> 00:50:16,191
Because he's on Infowars

987
00:50:17,215 --> 00:50:23,359
It kind of does highlight how like he is kind of stupid he's not as bad as the world's used

988
00:50:23,615 --> 00:50:24,383
He also

989
00:50:24,895 --> 00:50:25,663
He also

990
00:50:27,199 --> 00:50:27,711
Claimed that when he

991
00:50:27,967 --> 00:50:28,479
He painted half

992
00:50:28,735 --> 00:50:29,503
His body black

993
00:50:30,271 --> 00:50:32,831
Tell Russell bad news Brown at Wrestlemania

994
00:50:35,135 --> 00:50:36,159
Sure

995
00:50:36,415 --> 00:50:36,927
I believe it

996
00:50:37,183 --> 00:50:39,231
He was moonwalking and doing those

997
00:50:39,487 --> 00:50:41,023
Stayin Alive

998
00:50:42,303 --> 00:50:48,447
So at this point you said that they live is about Reaganomics

999
00:50:55,103 --> 00:50:56,127
Based on

1000
00:51:00,735 --> 00:51:02,015
When

1001
00:51:02,271 --> 00:51:04,575
We shot the scene

1002
00:51:08,415 --> 00:51:10,719
Respect

1003
00:51:20,703 --> 00:51:21,215
Oh really

1004
00:51:21,983 --> 00:51:24,799
That's interesting because you made a film about Reaganomics

1005
00:51:25,567 --> 00:51:27,359
So I'd like to talk a little bit about that

1006
00:51:29,151 --> 00:51:34,783
Quite frankly one of the reasons that homelessness is such a big issue and it's so devastating

1007
00:51:35,039 --> 00:51:36,831
Husband is because of Reagan

1008
00:51:37,343 --> 00:51:38,111
His policies

1009
00:51:38,367 --> 00:51:42,975
Directly the situation that we have on our hands

1010
00:51:44,511 --> 00:51:48,863
John Carpenter and Rowdy Roddy Piper made a movie about Reaganomics

1011
00:51:49,631 --> 00:51:51,935
I think maybe he doesn't understand all that too well

1012
00:51:52,191 --> 00:51:52,703
I thought

1013
00:51:52,959 --> 00:51:53,983
It was interesting growing up

1014
00:51:54,239 --> 00:51:55,007
Cuz I'm

1015
00:51:57,567 --> 00:51:58,335
When I grow up

1016
00:51:58,591 --> 00:51:59,103
Reagan was

1017
00:52:00,383 --> 00:52:03,455
The man trike right

1018
00:52:06,527 --> 00:52:07,551
Funny and cool

1019
00:52:08,319 --> 00:52:10,623
Cute jacket the movie with a bunch of garbage

1020
00:52:10,879 --> 00:52:11,647
Idiot

1021
00:52:12,927 --> 00:52:14,463
Stop

1022
00:52:14,975 --> 00:52:15,999
Speeches and everything

1023
00:52:16,511 --> 00:52:18,047
And then

1024
00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:19,071
Rock music

1025
00:52:19,839 --> 00:52:20,351
Batteries

1026
00:52:23,423 --> 00:52:27,007
Good man you read a few things I don't know

1027
00:52:28,287 --> 00:52:32,639
A 1981 on the heels of economic downturn unemployment was super high

1028
00:52:32,895 --> 00:52:36,735
Rockford Illinois had a real unemployment rate of 25%

1029
00:52:37,247 --> 00:52:39,551
Three states had unemployment rates / 14

1030
00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:42,623
At the depths of the

1031
00:52:43,647 --> 00:52:45,695
The number was still just around 10% Nash

1032
00:52:47,487 --> 00:52:50,047
It was bad it was really bad people were out of work

1033
00:52:50,303 --> 00:52:51,071
Having a bad time

1034
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:56,959
Noticing that there were tons of unemployed people becoming homeless solution that was not a solution

1035
00:52:57,471 --> 00:53:03,615
He didn't want the government to do anything but instead suggested the quote every church and synagogue would take in 10 welfare

1036
00:53:03,871 --> 00:53:05,919
The problem

1037
00:53:06,175 --> 00:53:07,199
Because he was stupid

1038
00:53:07,455 --> 00:53:12,831
And thought the entire idea of homeless people existing was a temporary notion it would go away with the economy got better

1039
00:53:13,343 --> 00:53:14,367
This is a stupid plan

1040
00:53:14,623 --> 00:53:17,951
For one reason because churches and synagogues are not magical entity

1041
00:53:18,463 --> 00:53:21,791
If you just required to take intense which could easily be 5:45

1042
00:53:22,047 --> 00:53:25,119
People that's going to cause a bump to their overhead

1043
00:53:25,375 --> 00:53:29,727
In times in homelessness Rose churches getting bankrupted like crazy

1044
00:53:29,983 --> 00:53:34,591
Just trying to provide the health of the government should be providing its citizens

1045
00:53:34,847 --> 00:53:39,967
Reagan solution is not Solutions pathetic attempt we shouldn't help that person it's someone else's job

1046
00:53:40,479 --> 00:53:41,503
To make matters worse

1047
00:53:42,015 --> 00:53:48,159
Reagan would slash the budget for the Department of Housing and Urban Development Department most likely to help

1048
00:53:48,671 --> 00:53:51,743
Reagan's entire platform to boil down to

1049
00:53:51,999 --> 00:53:53,535
Insisting that this isn't my job

1050
00:53:53,791 --> 00:53:57,375
Cutting funding for programs that are desperately needed in order to lower taxes

1051
00:53:57,631 --> 00:53:58,143
All the rich

1052
00:53:58,399 --> 00:53:59,679
Cuz I was the primary motivation

1053
00:53:59,935 --> 00:54:04,031
And then the final step blame the victims of his policies for the policies affect

1054
00:54:04,799 --> 00:54:07,359
He famously popularized the idea of a Welfare Queen

1055
00:54:07,871 --> 00:54:09,663
Based on a complete lie

1056
00:54:09,919 --> 00:54:13,503
I recommend everyone go listen to the episode of the dollop

1057
00:54:16,831 --> 00:54:21,439
Is that a character

1058
00:54:21,695 --> 00:54:24,511
The episode of the doubt they did live in Chicago

1059
00:54:24,767 --> 00:54:26,047
The me and Jordan are actually at

1060
00:54:26,559 --> 00:54:31,423
Great time they lay out the history of the idea of The Welfare Queen

1061
00:54:31,679 --> 00:54:32,703
F****** outfits

1062
00:54:32,959 --> 00:54:33,727
It's outrageous

1063
00:54:33,983 --> 00:54:35,263
How much deceit was behind it

1064
00:54:35,519 --> 00:54:36,031
Respect up

1065
00:54:36,287 --> 00:54:39,615
Good Morning America and said the people sleeping on Grayson

1066
00:54:39,871 --> 00:54:42,943
Mistreat we're doing it by choice

1067
00:54:46,783 --> 00:54:47,295
That homeless guy

1068
00:54:47,807 --> 00:54:48,319
Get the numbers

1069
00:54:50,879 --> 00:54:54,207
I was a kid I remembered that sort of

1070
00:54:54,463 --> 00:54:56,767
They're making a figures out there

1071
00:54:58,303 --> 00:54:58,815
Right

1072
00:55:00,607 --> 00:55:02,143
Airtight bag

1073
00:55:05,983 --> 00:55:07,519
If you worked at Captain D's

1074
00:55:07,775 --> 00:55:09,823
All your clothes smell like fish

1075
00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:11,103
Do you think you want that

1076
00:55:11,359 --> 00:55:13,663
Yeah it's the same uniform

1077
00:55:13,919 --> 00:55:14,431
Cheap clothes

1078
00:55:16,223 --> 00:55:21,599
America everywhere homeless person sleep should have Ronald Reagan

1079
00:55:21,855 --> 00:55:23,903
Peter dreier in urban policy analyst

1080
00:55:24,159 --> 00:55:28,255
And the director of the urban Environmental Policy Department at Occidental College in Los

1081
00:55:29,535 --> 00:55:32,351
I saw medication how little Reagan gave a s*** about this stuff

1082
00:55:32,607 --> 00:55:33,631
Article in the nation

00:55:42,335 --> 00:55:43,615

Wrestling

1091

Vincent Vincent trumpet

1092
00:56:04,351 --> 00:56:05,887
They were having

1093
00:56:07,167 --> 00:56:07,679
Meeting

1094
00:56:08,191 --> 00:56:09,215
With all the

1095
00:56:10,751 --> 00:56:11,519
And

1096
00:56:13,823 --> 00:56:14,591
What they were talking about

1097
00:56:15,615 --> 00:56:16,639
House heater change

1098
00:56:20,223 --> 00:56:20,735
Michael Tarver

1099
00:56:25,343 --> 00:56:26,111
He raised his hand to ask

1100
00:56:26,367 --> 00:56:26,879
Question

1101
00:56:32,767 --> 00:56:33,791
But raises

1102
00:56:35,839 --> 00:56:36,863
Excellent question shelter

1103
00:56:39,423 --> 00:56:40,959
No longer with the company

1104
00:56:41,983 --> 00:56:45,311
Also the reason I thought I recognized that name is cuz of

1105
00:56:45,823 --> 00:56:47,103
That's why I thought

1106
00:56:47,359 --> 00:56:48,639
Tarver is not a common name

1107
00:56:49,151 --> 00:56:51,455
I also this is from San Francisco

1108
00:56:52,479 --> 00:56:58,623

1112
00:57:12,959 --> 00:57:19,103
Go to us-92 3D to send it never ratified it making America Wanted only to UN member states to fail to ratify

1113
00:57:19,359 --> 00:57:20,127
Along with Tyler

1114
00:57:20,895 --> 00:57:22,431
The u.s. is either failed to sign

1115
00:57:22,687 --> 00:57:25,759
Or failed to ratify at least six other International treaties

1116
00:57:26,015 --> 00:57:27,551
In which housing was declared a human right

1117
00:57:29,855 --> 00:57:33,951
To come out very clearly and clear I believe it it

1118
00:57:34,207 --> 00:57:36,767
Yeah I believe it's

1119
00:57:42,399 --> 00:57:42,911
A bus stop bench

1120
00:57:43,935 --> 00:57:46,495
The little loud

Pigs everywhere

1123
00:57:50,591 --> 00:57:51,103
There's a lot of places.

1124
00:57:53,663 --> 00:57:54,175
Spiky thing

1125
00:57:55,711 --> 00:57:57,759
The under passes

1126
00:57:58,271 --> 00:57:58,783
They got the

1127
00:57:59,807 --> 00:58:01,855
Down

1128
00:58:04,415 --> 00:58:08,511
Thought it's crazy but it's someone's job to argue for that

1129
00:58:08,767 --> 00:58:10,303
City planner

1130
00:58:11,071 --> 00:58:14,655
Park bench

1131

Razor blades

1132
00:58:17,471 --> 00:58:21,055
Megaman comfortable

1133
00:58:21,311 --> 00:58:24,127
And when we were down there in the downtown area

1134
00:58:24,383 --> 00:58:26,175
There is a lot of

1135
00:58:32,319 --> 00:58:33,599
I've ever seen in my life

1136
00:58:35,903 --> 00:58:36,927
Walking down the street

1137
00:58:37,439 --> 00:58:39,743
There's an area where there was

1138
00:58:39,999 --> 00:58:44,351
Luca is clearly place around

1139
00:58:44,607 --> 00:58:46,143
Wasn't that

1140
00:58:46,655 --> 00:58:50,239
Weird to me those kind of like this is very sad and I feel bad about

1141
00:58:52,287 --> 00:58:53,311
We should be doing better

1142
00:58:54,591 --> 00:58:55,871
That was sort of like I seen

1143
00:58:56,127 --> 00:58:57,151
Stuff like that before

1144
00:58:57,407 --> 00:58:59,199
Yeah we walked a little bit further

1145
00:58:59,455 --> 00:59:03,551
And there's a huge company

1146
00:59:06,111 --> 00:59:08,927
Modern ornate building

1147
00:59:09,183 --> 00:59:10,463
And then if you got the look

1148
00:59:10,719 --> 00:59:11,999
Right in front of you

1149
00:59:12,255 --> 00:59:14,815
On the planter does it someone passed out

1150
00:59:16,607 --> 00:59:17,119
Almost

1151
00:59:17,375 --> 00:59:17,887
Naked

1152
00:59:19,167 --> 00:59:21,983
Did the juxtaposition of this giant

1153
00:59:24,031 --> 00:59:25,311
Billion dollar building

1154
00:59:25,567 --> 00:59:26,847
Someone

1155
00:59:27,359 --> 00:59:29,663
Sleeping in their planter just made me so f******

1156
00:59:29,919 --> 00:59:31,199
Depressed maybe so sad

1157
00:59:31,455 --> 00:59:32,735
Empathy knowledge that we

1158
00:59:32,991 --> 00:59:33,503
Can fix

1159
00:59:35,295 --> 00:59:37,087
Everybody's problem

1160
00:59:37,343 --> 00:59:39,647
But the idea that people are sleeping on the street it's something we

1161
00:59:39,903 --> 00:59:43,231
We absolutely can't fix our priority

1162
00:59:43,487 --> 00:59:44,511
This was a thing where

1163
00:59:48,863 --> 00:59:49,375
DC

1164
00:59:55,775 --> 00:59:56,287
And then like

1165
00:59:56,543 --> 00:59:57,055
Two blocks away

1166
00:59:58,335 --> 00:59:59,103
Nightmare

1167
00:59:59,359 --> 01:00:05,503
Episode

1168
01:00:05,759 --> 01:00:10,111
Hear about that you care about his

1169
01:00:11,647 --> 01:00:13,183
Lack of a response to

1170
01:00:13,439 --> 01:00:13,951
Hy-Vee

1171
01:00:14,207 --> 01:00:17,023
Not like a response

1172
01:00:19,071 --> 01:00:20,351
This cruel

1173
01:00:21,119 --> 01:00:21,631
For how was it

1174
01:00:21,887 --> 01:00:22,399
Pitch to you that

1175
01:00:27,775 --> 01:00:33,919
They all grown up I heard a lot of

1176
01:00:34,431 --> 01:00:37,247
I always like people who live in the

1177
01:00:37,759 --> 01:00:38,271
They all have

1178
01:00:38,527 --> 01:00:40,575
Giant TV I'll have cable

1179
01:00:49,279 --> 01:00:50,303
$500 a week

1180
01:00:52,607 --> 01:00:53,375
Just like you hear all this

1181
01:00:53,887 --> 01:00:54,655
And I'm just

1182
01:00:56,703 --> 01:00:57,471
A documentary

1183
01:00:59,007 --> 01:01:00,287
Oh that's a nightmare

1184
01:01:01,055 --> 01:01:03,359
Oh no

1185
01:01:03,615 --> 01:01:06,175
I think you know

1186
01:01:06,943 --> 01:01:09,503
I don't know I haven't thought this out too much to stop

1187
01:01:09,759 --> 01:01:10,783
Come up weirdly

1188
01:01:11,039 --> 01:01:15,647
I think that's the comfortable illusion that people have to have in order to not

1189
01:01:16,927 --> 01:01:18,719
Have to fix the

1190
01:01:18,975 --> 01:01:23,071
You know because of everybody was really aware of how people

1191
01:01:23,327 --> 01:01:28,191
Undercover Boss

1192
01:01:29,471 --> 01:01:31,519
Sure so did the people who want

1193
01:01:31,775 --> 01:01:32,287
To like

1194
01:01:33,055 --> 01:01:39,199
Cut taxes on corporations and the rich

1195
01:01:39,455 --> 01:01:45,599
Strip welfare program

1196
01:01:46,111 --> 01:01:52,255
Write your writing in the same way that right now we have the two versions of like

1197
01:01:52,511 --> 01:01:55,583
What's going on with these people immigrants

1198
01:01:55,839 --> 01:01:59,935
At the border with Mexico you have one version which is like

1199
01:02:00,191 --> 01:02:01,727
They're all

1200
01:02:01,983 --> 01:02:04,799
Which doesn't take into account the idea that a lot of them are people seeking

1201
01:02:05,055 --> 01:02:06,591
Sure

1202
01:02:06,847 --> 01:02:12,991
Which is not illegal in any way coming illegally or whatever

1203
01:02:13,247 --> 01:02:13,759
That is a

1204
01:02:14,271 --> 01:02:17,855
Not a not a crime really that's why a lot of our families came here

1205
01:02:18,111 --> 01:02:21,439
Wait there's that to the other version which is even crazier version which

1206
01:02:21,951 --> 01:02:22,463
Much closer.

1207
01:02:22,719 --> 01:02:23,999
Is that like

1208
01:02:24,767 --> 01:02:26,559
They're actually human traffickers

1209
01:02:26,815 --> 01:02:29,375
Yeah how to create these illusions

1210
01:02:29,631 --> 01:02:35,007
Do false realities Justified

1211
01:02:35,263 --> 01:02:36,543
In both cases

1212
01:02:37,311 --> 01:02:41,663
Is a function of white supremacy

1213
01:02:42,943 --> 01:02:45,503
Suck on the welfare cheat

1214
01:02:48,831 --> 01:02:50,879
Vantablack

1215
01:02:51,135 --> 01:02:52,415
They're coming here not working

1216
01:02:52,671 --> 01:02:53,695
Which which one is it

1217
01:02:53,951 --> 01:02:57,279
It's got to be one

1218
01:02:58,303 --> 01:03:00,863
Like you'll go on I kind of like I told you

1219
01:03:01,375 --> 01:03:01,887
Taking a little bit of

1220
01:03:02,911 --> 01:03:03,935
Media diet

1221
01:03:04,703 --> 01:03:06,495
I'm not really

1222
01:03:06,751 --> 01:03:07,263
But

1223
01:03:07,519 --> 01:03:10,079
Either you'd watch those videos of like

1224
01:03:10,335 --> 01:03:11,615
Republicans talking about

1225
01:03:11,871 --> 01:03:13,919
Supreme Court judges

1226
01:03:14,175 --> 01:03:18,527
You know it's like horseshit

1227
01:03:21,855 --> 01:03:25,951
The idea of telling a Republican or someone on the right there being hypocritical is pointless

1228
01:03:26,207 --> 01:03:31,327
Could Rogers

1229
01:03:31,583 --> 01:03:32,095
No I'm not

1230
01:03:32,607 --> 01:03:37,983
And you're wrong he never never never show your ass

1231
01:03:38,239 --> 01:03:39,775
Fart on somebody

1232
01:03:40,031 --> 01:03:42,335
Crazy

1233
01:03:42,847 --> 01:03:47,455
You're you're you're you're lying about my ass being asses don't exist

1234
01:03:47,711 --> 01:03:48,223
Doll

1235
01:03:48,479 --> 01:03:51,807
Battle singing

1236
01:03:52,063 --> 01:03:52,575
Dick Cheney

1237
01:03:54,111 --> 01:03:54,623
How much money

1238
01:03:55,391 --> 01:03:55,903
Is enough

1239
01:03:56,159 --> 01:03:56,671
You're like

1240
01:03:56,927 --> 01:03:57,695
People are dying

1241
01:03:58,207 --> 01:04:01,535
But this Halliburton

1242
01:04:02,047 --> 01:04:02,815
How much is enough

1243
01:04:03,071 --> 01:04:03,583
Money

1244
01:04:04,863 --> 01:04:05,631
You want to be like the

1245
01:04:05,887 --> 01:04:06,399
King

1246
01:04:06,911 --> 01:04:08,959
Where have all the money

1247
01:04:10,495 --> 01:04:11,007
If I was

1248
01:04:12,031 --> 01:04:14,079
It at one of these like Elites in the United

1249
01:04:14,335 --> 01:04:15,359
I would

1250
01:04:15,615 --> 01:04:16,127
I would be liked

1251
01:04:17,919 --> 01:04:18,943
Like what you want

1252
01:04:19,199 --> 01:04:19,967
Instead of me having

1253
01:04:20,223 --> 01:04:20,991
4 billion

1254
01:04:21,503 --> 01:04:22,015
Maybe I'm Leo

1255
01:04:22,271 --> 01:04:23,295
YouTube then

1256
01:04:25,343 --> 01:04:26,111
People around me are living

1257
01:04:27,903 --> 01:04:31,743
Let's go.

1258
01:04:31,999 --> 01:04:32,767
Stages

1259
01:04:33,535 --> 01:04:34,559
Far off

1260
01:04:45,823 --> 01:04:47,615
Reality

1261
01:04:47,871 --> 01:04:54,015
I think she recognized I think Alex is really clunky job of expressing

1262
01:04:54,271 --> 01:04:55,551
Expresses in a little bit

1263
01:04:55,807 --> 01:05:01,951
We can't possibly understand the motivations of people on high or low

1264
01:05:03,999 --> 01:05:07,583
For you and I you don't know what it's like

1265
01:05:07,839 --> 01:05:09,119
Fracture making those two

1266
01:05:09,375 --> 01:05:10,399
Decisions in A Few Good Men

1267
01:05:12,191 --> 01:05:15,263
The truth

1268
01:05:15,519 --> 01:05:16,031
Tough decision

1269
01:05:18,079 --> 01:05:19,871
Although I do think there's something to that

1270
01:05:20,127 --> 01:05:21,919
What I mean Boris and I

1271
01:05:22,175 --> 01:05:25,247
In terms of money we just want

1272
01:05:25,503 --> 01:05:28,063
Where are the game that we're playing

1273
01:05:28,319 --> 01:05:29,599
We want to get by

1274
01:05:29,855 --> 01:05:33,439
You get married and have kids

1275
01:05:33,951 --> 01:05:40,095
Hey you never know

1276
01:05:40,351 --> 01:05:46,495
Level which is like I need to have a house yet

1277
01:05:46,751 --> 01:05:47,263
Becomes like

1278
01:05:47,519 --> 01:05:50,591
Can I help them through college whatever

1279
01:05:50,847 --> 01:05:52,127
Version it is in your head

1280
01:05:52,383 --> 01:05:56,735
And then there's another level above that which is like business ownership probably

1281
01:05:56,991 --> 01:06:03,135
And then there's a level above that which is Dynasty build

1282
01:06:03,391 --> 01:06:03,903
I want

1283
01:06:04,159 --> 01:06:06,975
No one that ever comes from my loin

1284
01:06:07,231 --> 01:06:07,999
To have to work

1285
01:06:08,255 --> 01:06:12,607
Hell I want Rockefeller money

1286
01:06:13,119 --> 01:06:16,191
Right that'll last for Generations

1287
01:06:16,703 --> 01:06:17,983
Great-great-grandfather Mart

1288
01:06:18,751 --> 01:06:21,567
If some of that comes from money so it comes from great

1289
01:06:21,823 --> 01:06:24,639
Big

1290
01:06:25,407 --> 01:06:28,991
So like I said there's a decent chance that even with

1291
01:06:29,503 --> 01:06:31,807
Predict ain't much of a monster as he is

1292
01:06:32,063 --> 01:06:33,855
As much damages he caused

1293
01:06:35,135 --> 01:06:38,719
I think there's a possibility that somewhere deep within his dark

1294
01:06:39,231 --> 01:06:41,791
Robotic replaced

1295
01:06:42,047 --> 01:06:46,399
I think there's a possibility that he believed that by doing really really terrible thing

1296
01:06:46,911 --> 01:06:48,703
He could reach a positive outcome

1297
01:06:48,959 --> 01:06:51,519
Which might be breaking some eggs to make an omelet

1298
01:06:51,775 --> 01:06:52,543
Maybe

1299
01:06:52,799 --> 01:06:57,407
I don't want it I don't want to say that excuse is right

1300
01:06:57,663 --> 01:06:58,175
And then

1301
01:06:58,431 --> 01:07:04,575
You come out the other side you forgive all of the Innocents that I killed in order to have this

1302
01:07:06,367 --> 01:07:06,879
As I was watching

1303
01:07:09,183 --> 01:07:10,207
Documentary

1304
01:07:12,255 --> 01:07:17,631
Want to do

1305
01:07:18,655 --> 01:07:20,447
Thursday

1306
01:07:23,007 --> 01:07:23,519
You just like

1307
01:07:24,799 --> 01:07:25,311
She was

1308
01:07:25,567 --> 01:07:26,079
The ark

1309
01:07:29,663 --> 01:07:30,175
True Arc

1310
01:07:34,015 --> 01:07:34,527
You understand

1311
01:07:35,039 --> 01:07:35,551
They're all just sit on it

1312
01:07:37,087 --> 01:07:37,599
Imma throw this out there

1313
01:07:40,671 --> 01:07:41,439
What if

1314
01:07:42,975 --> 01:07:43,999
That was a

1315
01:07:51,935 --> 01:07:52,959
So I had a friend

1316
01:07:56,543 --> 01:07:57,055
Right

1317
01:07:57,567 --> 01:07:58,079
BB cream

1318
01:08:01,151 --> 01:08:02,431
How did Freddie Prinze jr.

1319
01:08:05,503 --> 01:08:07,551
Freddie Prinze

1320
01:08:07,807 --> 01:08:08,575
They're all sit Round Table

1321
01:08:11,135 --> 01:08:11,647
Ideas

1322
01:08:14,463 --> 01:08:15,231
I won't say who the

1323
01:08:17,279 --> 01:08:19,327
No need to put people's business on the streets

1324
01:08:20,863 --> 01:08:22,143
Imma throw this

1325
01:08:26,751 --> 01:08:27,263
I might

1326
01:08:31,615 --> 01:08:32,127
What if

1327
01:08:32,639 --> 01:08:33,407
Mark Henry anime

1328
01:08:35,455 --> 01:08:35,967
Hit in the head

1329
01:08:38,527 --> 01:08:39,039
We find out later

1330
01:08:54,655 --> 01:08:58,495
Great weekend

1331
01:08:59,007 --> 01:09:01,823
Does Michael Symon say this

1332
01:09:05,919 --> 01:09:08,479
Your delivery on that was strong

1333
01:09:08,735 --> 01:09:09,247
Whoa

1334
01:09:09,759 --> 01:09:10,271
Yeah that's

1335
01:09:11,039 --> 01:09:11,807
That would probably

1336
01:09:12,063 --> 01:09:13,087
Big Ben fine

1337
01:09:13,343 --> 01:09:14,111
At some point though

1338
01:09:14,623 --> 01:09:20,767
Oh you probably gave birth to a hand

1339
01:09:21,023 --> 01:09:22,047
98 but I am

1340
01:09:22,303 --> 01:09:23,327
Getting back to what we were talking

1341
01:09:25,119 --> 01:09:29,215
I think there is sort of this this

1342
01:09:29,471 --> 01:09:30,239
Fang of like

1343
01:09:30,751 --> 01:09:32,287
The feel powerful the elites

1344
01:09:33,055 --> 01:09:33,567
Fairlife

1345
01:09:37,407 --> 01:09:39,455
Ron Reagan Jr

1346
01:09:40,223 --> 01:09:40,735
You know

1347
01:09:40,991 --> 01:09:42,015
He's he's at Becky

1348
01:09:42,527 --> 01:09:43,295
Commercial from about 8

1349
01:09:44,575 --> 01:09:48,159
These are you sick of people talking about God

1350
01:09:48,415 --> 01:09:49,951
Groceries

1351
01:09:50,207 --> 01:09:51,231
He's obviously liberal

1352
01:09:53,279 --> 01:09:53,791
But

1353
01:09:54,047 --> 01:09:55,071
Especially to

1354
01:09:56,607 --> 01:09:57,119
You're growing up here

1355
01:10:00,959 --> 01:10:04,287
I've been the coolest dude

1356
01:10:04,543 --> 01:10:05,567
Love you let's go through that

1357
01:10:06,335 --> 01:10:09,663
We're going through with Rowdy Roddy Piper

1358
01:10:09,919 --> 01:10:15,295
I'm so sorry

1359
01:10:15,551 --> 01:10:19,903
This relapse faith in the hot rod you probably will as well

1360
01:10:20,159 --> 01:10:21,695
Nexlab

1361
01:10:21,951 --> 01:10:23,231
It was where I was

1362
01:10:23,743 --> 01:10:25,535
Maybe he doesn't know what show he's on

1363
01:10:26,047 --> 01:10:27,839
Unfortunately this clip

1364
01:10:29,887 --> 01:10:36,031
Cuz I feel like this all the time

1365
01:10:37,311 --> 01:10:40,639
Left control going on

1366
01:10:40,895 --> 01:10:47,039
The signal broadcast 24 hours a day

1367
01:10:47,295 --> 01:10:51,647
Lunch

1368
01:11:01,119 --> 01:11:05,215
Taking care of America

1369
01:11:05,471 --> 01:11:08,799
Husband was going on

1370
01:11:09,055 --> 01:11:13,151
That hurt while what was going on

1371
01:11:13,407 --> 01:11:14,175
Doing

1372
01:11:17,759 --> 01:11:20,575
Concussions while that also

1373
01:11:21,087 --> 01:11:22,111
Yeah I blame

1374
01:11:23,647 --> 01:11:24,415
People turning

1375
01:11:25,439 --> 01:11:25,951
Radeon

1376
01:11:26,207 --> 01:11:26,719
To Alex

1377
01:11:26,975 --> 01:11:29,535
Oh yeah

1378
01:11:31,583 --> 01:11:34,911
You and I are even examples of people without like

1379
01:11:35,423 --> 01:11:39,263
Close examination of Alex we're like this

1380
01:11:39,519 --> 01:11:43,871
Like we didn't think he was too big of a problem as we tonight and I think Rowdy probably

1381
01:11:44,383 --> 01:11:45,919
Identify

1382
01:11:46,431 --> 01:11:50,783
Or feels a bit of a kinship with them in the sense of like he's a showman just like me

1383
01:11:51,551 --> 01:11:52,063
You know

1384
01:11:52,575 --> 01:11:58,207
And back in the 90s Roddy Piper did extensive battles

1385
01:11:58,463 --> 01:12:03,071
Ric Flair got together Powers over nobody

1386
01:12:03,839 --> 01:12:06,143
Who's that when he had tried to get a family together

1387
01:12:07,935 --> 01:12:12,799
Piper try and fight the nwosu

1388
01:12:13,055 --> 01:12:15,615
And then head to I get the player right

1389
01:12:15,871 --> 01:12:20,735
That worked a very very

1390
01:12:21,503 --> 01:12:23,551
Group together

1391
01:12:25,087 --> 01:12:26,367
Got the No Limit soldiers

1392
01:12:26,623 --> 01:12:28,671
A lot of faction Warfare back in the day

1393
01:12:30,975 --> 01:12:37,119
Here

1394
01:12:37,375 --> 01:12:41,727
I was really bummed out

1395
01:12:42,239 --> 01:12:42,751
Alex

1396
01:12:43,007 --> 01:12:43,775
I love you

1397
01:12:44,543 --> 01:12:46,079
Friend

1398
01:12:46,335 --> 01:12:52,479
He's been he's known Alex for like 20 years they went back

1399
01:12:53,503 --> 01:12:59,647
Broken because Rogan

1400
01:12:59,903 --> 01:13:00,671
Joe also is like

1401
01:13:00,927 --> 01:13:01,439
This is

1402
01:13:01,951 --> 01:13:05,023
Really stupid with Alex's about Anthony Bourdain suicide

1403
01:13:05,535 --> 01:13:07,071
Like

1404
01:13:07,327 --> 01:13:10,399
Pedophile ring news about to come out

1405
01:13:10,655 --> 01:13:14,239
Say all this f****** awful

1406
01:13:15,775 --> 01:13:16,799
F****** cowardly

1407
01:13:17,055 --> 01:13:21,663
Is B Rogan is now being like I love this guy but you need to calm down

1408
01:13:21,919 --> 01:13:28,063
Like your rhetoric is terrible your rhetoric is irresponsible and it's

1409
01:13:28,319 --> 01:13:34,463
Eating lots of people program you like

1410
01:13:34,719 --> 01:13:35,231
I'm sorry

1411
01:13:35,487 --> 01:13:40,863
I love this guy he's my friend I'm sorry that I had him on my show

1412
01:13:41,119 --> 01:13:47,263
Milo

1413
01:13:47,519 --> 01:13:48,031
Thing of like

1414
01:13:48,543 --> 01:13:54,687
I'll give anybody talk and it's like

1415
01:13:54,943 --> 01:14:01,087
We're going to have a conversation

1416
01:14:06,719 --> 01:14:12,863
You should have all of the clips of Ted Nugent

1417
01:14:13,119 --> 01:14:18,751
Stuck on his gun yeah yeah

1418
01:14:19,007 --> 01:14:25,151
This is crazy for saying about Trump videos of Ted Nugent

1419
01:14:27,455 --> 01:14:33,599
Bear bear bear

1420
01:14:35,391 --> 01:14:41,535
I'm I'm an observer I'm also tired

1421
01:14:41,791 --> 01:14:45,119
Responsibility

1422
01:14:47,167 --> 01:14:53,311
Eddie Bravo

1423
01:14:53,567 --> 01:14:56,127
Probably

1424
01:14:57,919 --> 01:14:58,687
Yes

1425
01:14:58,943 --> 01:15:03,807
You keep your crazy in a box you don't allow these horrible horrible people

1426
01:15:04,063 --> 01:15:07,647
To be exposed and not like his audience doesn't know who Ted Nugent

1427
01:15:07,903 --> 01:15:10,463
When you have a 2-hour conversation with a person

1428
01:15:10,719 --> 01:15:14,303
Humanizes them and allows you to be

1429
01:15:14,815 --> 01:15:17,631
Like surrogates

1430
01:15:18,143 --> 01:15:19,935
I love Joe Rogan

1431
01:15:20,447 --> 01:15:23,775
And I don't know what who a lot about Ted Nugent

1432
01:15:24,031 --> 01:15:29,151
Amicably cartoon have 3 hours I'm going to come away from it like

1433
01:15:29,663 --> 01:15:31,199
Here's a here's an example of it

1434
01:15:31,711 --> 01:15:33,503
When I used to listen to Loveline all the time

1435
01:15:33,759 --> 01:15:39,391
Yeah first of all I thought Adam Carolla there was a

1436
01:15:39,647 --> 01:15:40,671
Lie about that

1437
01:15:40,927 --> 01:15:41,439
He trains

1438
01:15:41,695 --> 01:15:47,583
But also

1439
01:15:47,839 --> 01:15:49,631
John Mayer

1440
01:15:49,887 --> 01:15:56,031
And if for some reason I liked John Mayer's because he was on love

1441
01:16:02,687 --> 01:16:07,551
That you have when you are a charismatic popular figure who interviews people for long periods of time

1442
01:16:07,807 --> 01:16:09,343
Like long as it says

1443
01:16:09,599 --> 01:16:10,111
Take a short

1444
01:16:10,367 --> 01:16:12,671
Super edited interview

1445
01:16:13,183 --> 01:16:14,719
It's really really dangerous to not

1446
01:16:15,487 --> 01:16:18,303
Respect and understand your responsibilities you have

1447
01:16:18,559 --> 01:16:20,351
And the fact that Joe Rogan just like

1448
01:16:20,863 --> 01:16:22,655
I love Alex Jones he's got a calm down

1449
01:16:22,911 --> 01:16:25,215
I think he's not dealing with the idea that like

1450
01:16:25,727 --> 01:16:27,263
I am a part of this

1451
01:16:27,519 --> 01:16:30,079
I didn't have to be I have introduced

1452
01:16:30,591 --> 01:16:31,103
Millions

1453
01:16:31,359 --> 01:16:32,127
The people to Alex

1454
01:16:33,407 --> 01:16:35,455
Mega Million but yet

1455
01:16:35,711 --> 01:16:41,855
Those people probably already knew who he was but he's doing that thing

1456
01:16:42,111 --> 01:16:46,207
But also

1457
01:16:46,463 --> 01:16:49,791
He allowed Alex sound like he was talking about

1458
01:16:50,047 --> 01:16:51,071
Anyway

1459
01:16:51,327 --> 01:16:52,607
You should have pushed back all this

1460
01:16:52,863 --> 01:16:54,143
To expose the Alex

1461
01:16:54,399 --> 01:16:55,679
You're lying to me again

1462
01:16:55,935 --> 01:16:57,727
Yeah because he loves him

1463
01:16:59,263 --> 01:17:01,055
Really really f****** dangerous

1464
01:17:01,311 --> 01:17:02,335
No unfortunately

1465
01:17:03,359 --> 01:17:04,127
Rowdy Roddy Piper

1466
01:17:04,895 --> 01:17:05,407
Also

1467
01:17:06,687 --> 01:17:07,199
Matt Bomer

1468
01:17:07,711 --> 01:17:10,015
The next

1469
01:17:10,271 --> 01:17:13,599
Rowdy Roddy Piper says something

1470
01:17:14,111 --> 01:17:17,439
This is a kind of tell you that needs to be

1471
01:17:22,047 --> 01:17:25,887
Rowdy

1472
01:17:33,823 --> 01:17:39,711
So Alex is smiling like the cat just ate the canary like he is over the moon when he says that

1473
01:17:39,967 --> 01:17:43,551
Rowdy Roddy Piper man is he's rebellious by Nature

1474
01:17:44,063 --> 01:17:47,647
What Alex thinks he meant is that he thinks that the South was right

1475
01:17:47,903 --> 01:17:48,671
In the Civil War

1476
01:17:49,695 --> 01:17:55,839
Because that's what Alex thinks when he talks about being a rebel

1477
01:17:56,095 --> 01:17:58,143
That is without Alex

1478
01:17:58,399 --> 01:17:59,167
Oh s***

1479
01:17:59,935 --> 01:18:04,799
Rowdy right on.

1480
01:18:05,055 --> 01:18:11,199
I don't think Rowdy Roddy Piper

1481
01:18:11,455 --> 01:18:12,223
I'm rebellious okay

1482
01:18:13,759 --> 01:18:16,063
The system Allen

1483
01:18:16,831 --> 01:18:21,951
I believe in the South will rise again

1484
01:18:22,207 --> 01:18:23,743
F****** Piper is from Canada

1485
01:18:23,999 --> 01:18:25,023
Okay

1486
01:18:27,071 --> 01:18:29,631
But like that to me was like a moment or like oh no

1487
01:18:29,887 --> 01:18:30,911
Oh no Alex

1488
01:18:31,167 --> 01:18:35,263
I think you should have asked a follow-up question there

1489
01:18:36,799 --> 01:18:38,079
You ear your moron Alex

1490
01:18:39,615 --> 01:18:40,383
Galaxy

1491
01:18:40,639 --> 01:18:42,687
Does a guy who I know this 100

1492
01:18:43,455 --> 01:18:45,503
For surviving Alex of the guy who can

1493
01:18:46,015 --> 01:18:46,783
Fit whatever you say

1494
01:18:48,319 --> 01:18:51,903
Hyperbole

1495
01:18:53,951 --> 01:18:54,463
That's

1496
01:18:54,975 --> 01:18:57,279
Because otherwise there would be no reason to be like

1497
01:18:57,535 --> 01:19:00,095
Can you believe he's born Rebel

1498
01:19:00,351 --> 01:19:01,375
Cuz of course he is

1499
01:19:01,631 --> 01:19:07,775
Anybody walk the beaten path in life

1500
01:19:08,031 --> 01:19:09,055
Iconoclast in many ways

1501
01:19:09,311 --> 01:19:12,895
Surprise me

1502
01:19:13,151 --> 01:19:14,175
I know

1503
01:19:14,431 --> 01:19:15,711
Hundred percent

1504
01:19:19,807 --> 01:19:25,695
I'm certain that definitely isn't

1505
01:19:32,351 --> 01:19:35,423
A mind control

1506
01:19:35,679 --> 01:19:37,727
Society

1507
01:19:40,287 --> 01:19:43,359
Putting stuff

1508
01:19:43,615 --> 01:19:46,175
Major conspiracy for a new world order

1509
01:19:46,431 --> 01:19:50,527
Myhumboldt

1510
01:19:55,391 --> 01:19:56,159
Rowdy

1511
01:20:02,303 --> 01:20:08,447
So couple things really quick Piper is trying to become something is important

1512
01:20:08,703 --> 01:20:09,471
Thought

1513
01:20:09,727 --> 01:20:11,007
Back to it later

1514
01:20:11,263 --> 01:20:11,775
But

1515
01:20:12,031 --> 01:20:16,384
The most important hyperboles in the New World Order

1516
01:20:16,896 --> 01:20:17,408
Second

1517
01:20:18,176 --> 01:20:20,224
Alex just displayed there

1518
01:20:20,480 --> 01:20:20,992
Is

1519
01:20:21,248 --> 01:20:22,272
Trademark Alex Jones

1520
01:20:22,784 --> 01:20:28,928

1550
01:22:18,240 --> 01:22:23,872

Malicious the interview Tacker

1563
01:23:09,440 --> 01:23:15,584
It's not what you need exactly whenever you're cutting them off you have a clean enough

1564
01:23:16,608 --> 01:23:18,400
Right battles the NWO

1565
01:23:18,912 --> 01:23:23,520
So most people don't catch on to it cuz if I were that I would get

1566
01:23:23,776 --> 01:23:27,616
. well you know there was going to WrestleMania

1567
01:23:27,872 --> 01:23:28,896
Morton Downey jr.

1568
01:23:29,408 --> 01:23:30,944
Kept interrupting Rowdy Roddy Piper

1569
01:23:31,456 --> 01:23:32,480
Rowdy

1570
01:23:32,736 --> 01:23:36,576
Had enough of it in like that he said don't blow no smoke in my face

1571
01:23:37,088 --> 01:23:37,856
And then he got a fire

1572
01:23:40,672 --> 01:23:42,208
Piper

1573
01:23:48,352 --> 01:23:52,704
I respect you and what you doing in Sean

1574
01:23:56,544 --> 01:24:00,896
Educated

1575
01:24:04,224 --> 01:24:05,760
I don't want to

1576
01:24:08,832 --> 01:24:11,136
Have to go someplace

1577
01:24:11,648 --> 01:24:12,416
So he keeps

1578
01:24:14,464 --> 01:24:15,232
Roddy Piper

1579
01:24:15,744 --> 01:24:16,768
Sir themes themes

1580
01:24:17,024 --> 01:24:19,328
To Beaver like the world

1581
01:24:19,584 --> 01:24:21,120
Yeah

1582
01:24:21,376 --> 01:24:23,680
I completely agree with

1583
01:24:23,936 --> 01:24:24,960
Sort of nefarious

1584
01:24:25,472 --> 01:24:30,848
Forces behind I would agree with that but I would refrain

1585
01:24:31,104 --> 01:24:33,152
Capitalism regulation

1586
01:24:33,408 --> 01:24:33,920
Business

1587
01:24:34,176 --> 01:24:36,224
But those sorts of things

1588
01:24:36,480 --> 01:24:42,624
Crushing

1589
01:24:42,880 --> 01:24:43,392
In about like

1590
01:24:43,904 --> 01:24:44,928
What they are

1591
01:24:45,440 --> 01:24:48,000
But we could agree on the concept that like yes

1592
01:24:48,256 --> 01:24:50,560
Nothing is static the world is constantly

1593
01:24:54,144 --> 01:24:55,424
Sort of a picture

1594
01:24:55,680 --> 01:24:56,704
What he and Alex

1595
01:24:57,984 --> 01:25:01,056
I think they want one

1596
01:25:01,312 --> 01:25:03,104
Governmental Force

1597
01:25:03,616 --> 01:25:06,176
In the world

1598
01:25:06,688 --> 01:25:09,760
If everybody's got their own

1599
01:25:10,016 --> 01:25:13,344
You can get that unless he's around

1600
01:25:15,136 --> 01:25:16,160
Natural

1601
01:25:16,416 --> 01:25:21,024
I don't I'm not very sure I would have been able to create a 1/2 government

1602
01:25:23,072 --> 01:25:25,376
But that

1603
01:25:26,400 --> 01:25:32,544
We can get everybody on the same page another ideas

1604
01:25:44,064 --> 01:25:48,928
Rowdy Roddy Piper loves brush

1605
01:25:56,864 --> 01:25:59,168
First point

1606
01:25:59,424 --> 01:26:01,984
Yeah the people that people are

1607
01:26:03,264 --> 01:26:04,032
Papa

1608
01:26:04,288 --> 01:26:05,568
Pop-up is in charge over there

1609
01:26:05,824 --> 01:26:06,848
Iris

1610
01:26:07,360 --> 01:26:09,664
He's talking about going to Russia

1611
01:26:09,920 --> 01:26:10,944
1999

1612
01:26:14,528 --> 01:26:15,552
For his career and life

1613
01:26:17,344 --> 01:26:18,624
I would say

1614
01:26:18,880 --> 01:26:19,392
Send send

1615
01:26:19,904 --> 01:26:20,416

1616
01:26:20,672 --> 01:26:21,696
Power and he's a bad dude

1617
01:26:25,536 --> 01:26:26,560
Love the strongman

1618
01:26:29,120 --> 01:26:30,656
You think I would

1619
01:26:31,680 --> 01:26:32,192
Question

1620
01:26:32,704 --> 01:26:33,728
Do you think

1621
01:26:33,984 --> 01:26:35,520
People in foreign countries

1622
01:26:35,776 --> 01:26:38,592
Like do you think people in Bulgaria really love Russo

1623
01:26:39,104 --> 01:26:41,920
What do you think that the Russians back then actually like

1624
01:26:45,248 --> 01:26:46,016
Nick Hood

1625
01:26:46,272 --> 01:26:48,064

Colog whatever

1628
01:26:51,648 --> 01:26:53,696
Look I don't like wrestling as much as you do

1629
01:26:53,952 --> 01:26:57,280
I know a bit of stuff but I don't know everything

1630
01:27:01,376 --> 01:27:03,168
Wait

1631
01:27:03,424 --> 01:27:07,776
I have no idea why they were so popular in Israel the people

1632
01:27:08,032 --> 01:27:13,920
Do they like these fake version I even Bulgarian about title T-shirt with a story

1633
01:27:14,176 --> 01:27:16,224
The Bulgarian Brute

1634
01:27:16,480 --> 01:27:19,552
The fake version Lake do people in Mexico like

1635
01:27:19,808 --> 01:27:22,368
Alberto Del Rio when he was in WWE

1636
01:27:22,624 --> 01:27:24,928
Mexico

1637
01:27:30,816 --> 01:27:31,840
Wrightwood

1638
01:27:32,096 --> 01:27:32,864
Russian Felix

1639
01:27:33,632 --> 01:27:34,144
Yeah

1640
01:27:36,704 --> 01:27:37,216
Me

1641
01:27:40,032 --> 01:27:41,568
You know it wasn't me

1642
01:27:41,824 --> 01:27:44,384
What is is bad

1643
01:27:44,640 --> 01:27:47,968
Irish people love

1644
01:27:48,224 --> 01:27:50,272
He's a legend

1645
01:27:51,296 --> 01:27:51,808
Absolute

1646
01:27:52,320 --> 01:27:56,160
I meant some of them probably

1647
01:27:56,416 --> 01:27:57,184
What is well-loved

1648
01:27:57,696 --> 01:27:59,744
Citizen X when I was picking up but like

1649
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:06,144
Line between Lexington

1650
01:28:06,400 --> 01:28:07,680
Rotten who used to do a British

1651
01:28:08,704 --> 01:28:12,032
Character accent everything.

1652
01:28:13,056 --> 01:28:14,336
Over there

1653
01:28:14,848 --> 01:28:17,408
Do countries hang their hat on

1654
01:28:18,944 --> 01:28:23,296
Maybe inoffensive portrayal of them just to see representation I don't know

1655
01:28:29,440 --> 01:28:34,048
Russia almost never Italian Muhammad Hassan

1656
01:28:34,560 --> 01:28:35,072
He's Italian

1657
01:28:38,656 --> 01:28:39,424
Mark copani

1658
01:28:39,680 --> 01:28:45,568
That was his name

1659
01:28:45,824 --> 01:28:46,336
But you know

1660
01:28:46,848 --> 01:28:48,128
Or elected

1661
01:28:49,152 --> 01:28:50,944
Like when

1662
01:28:56,832 --> 01:28:57,344
At 8

1663
01:28:58,368 --> 01:28:59,392
The robot Johnny 5

1664
01:29:00,928 --> 01:29:02,720
Yeah I know you're talking about

1665
01:29:05,024 --> 01:29:11,168
Yeah short-circuit at 2

1666
01:29:13,472 --> 01:29:14,496
Then you came up with

1667
01:29:15,008 --> 01:29:16,032
Congratulations. It's like

1668
01:29:21,664 --> 01:29:23,712
Black people enjoy

1669
01:29:26,016 --> 01:29:26,784
I don't think so

1670
01:29:27,296 --> 01:29:30,624
I would imagine it we're getting to it

1671
01:29:31,136 --> 01:29:31,904
But

1672
01:29:33,184 --> 01:29:34,720
Getting white women appreciate

1673
01:29:38,048 --> 01:29:41,376
Do you think babies enjoy the little man

1674
01:29:41,632 --> 01:29:42,400
Don't cry

1675
01:29:42,656 --> 01:29:43,936
White Chicks

1676
01:29:44,704 --> 01:29:45,216
Anderson

1677
01:29:46,240 --> 01:29:46,752
At no point

1678
01:29:51,616 --> 01:29:56,224
Had to be the guy doing a bit

1679
01:29:57,504 --> 01:30:00,576
I don't know I don't know if I trust

1680
01:30:01,088 --> 01:30:01,600
Garbage

1681
01:30:02,368 --> 01:30:02,880
Try to make them

1682
01:30:04,160 --> 01:30:05,440
The white women that they're supposed

1683
01:30:07,232 --> 01:30:08,256
Make the white women

1684
01:30:08,512 --> 01:30:10,560
Makeup look more like these

1685
01:30:11,072 --> 01:30:11,840
Guys look

1686
01:30:12,096 --> 01:30:16,704
See now that's an interesting that's an interesting ideas for them to have done it

1687
01:30:16,960 --> 01:30:22,336
But I don't believe that if music movie critic would do that kind of a review without

1688
01:30:22,592 --> 01:30:28,736
Most of it being an existential crisis

1689
01:30:33,088 --> 01:30:33,600
Greater movie

1690
01:30:35,904 --> 01:30:36,928

But I'm in man

How are they

1698
01:31:02,272 --> 01:31:03,808

1699
01:31:04,576 --> 01:31:08,672
I have nope there's there are

1700
01:31:08,928 --> 01:31:12,000
Certain people and I it's not a jealous thing

1701

I wish them all the best in the world

1703
01:31:15,584 --> 01:31:16,608
But there's certain people

1704
01:31:16,864 --> 01:31:17,632

I never watched a couple of them as their personalities to be

1723
01:32:19,072 --> 01:32:21,376
Not like I hated the flashlight

1724
01:32:21,632 --> 01:32:27,008
Anybody would watch these boring a bunch of different types of like sodas

1727
01:32:34,432 --> 01:32:39,296
How it has 8 million

1728
01:32:39,808 --> 01:32:41,088

1million I don't understand

1731
01:32:48,256 --> 01:32:54,400
Tableau's whereupon you can paint whatever you'd like to be there so you can just imagine whatever character is there you are

01:32:54,912 --> 01:32:56,960
All that stuff is fine I get I get that

1733
01:32:57,216 --> 01:32:58,240
What I don't understand

1734
01:32:59,008 --> 01:32:59,520
Is

1735
01:32:59,776 --> 01:33:00,288
They

1736
01:33:00,544 --> 01:33:01,056
Have

1737
01:33:01,312 --> 01:33:02,080
A f****** laugh

1738
01:33:02,336 --> 01:33:02,848
Track

1739
01:33:03,104 --> 01:33:03,872
4

1740
01:33:04,128 --> 01:33:06,432
The people who are making that show

1741
01:33:06,688 --> 01:33:07,968
The people behind the scene

1742
01:33:08,224 --> 01:33:14,368
Are literally standing around while they're recording it and there's a gas leak in that f****** Studio

1743
01:33:14,624 --> 01:33:15,136
Talk Soup

1744
01:33:16,672 --> 01:33:17,184
Yeah

1745
01:33:17,440 --> 01:33:20,512
It's so uncomfortable I was watching one of my

01:33:20,768 --> 01:33:26,912
What the f*** are these laugh like they're saying things that aren't really that funny and

1747
01:33:29,216 --> 01:33:34,592
Laugh track

1748
01:33:34,848 --> 01:33:35,872
Yeah it's even like

1749
01:33:36,384 --> 01:33:37,152
I haven't watched

1750
01:33:37,408 --> 01:33:41,504
Sitcoms that comes in a long time and I love old shows

1751
01:33:41,760 --> 01:33:44,832
Are there a bunch of shows that I love you

1752
01:33:49,440 --> 01:33:51,488
Suck

1753
01:33:53,024 --> 01:33:56,096
It might hurt my possibilities with career advancement

1754
01:33:56,608 --> 01:33:58,144
Who cares we're not on YouTube

1755
01:33:58,656 --> 01:33:59,936
I don't know man very very weird

1756
01:34:06,848 --> 01:34:09,152
The world shirt circuit tester

1757
01:34:09,408 --> 01:34:15,552
Good things on YouTube

1758
01:34:16,320 --> 01:34:17,344
Kidtastic Lovett

1759
01:34:19,904 --> 01:34:21,696
Will be watching that bud

1760
01:34:25,024 --> 01:34:31,168
Piper was complaining about the language

1761
01:34:31,424 --> 01:34:37,568
The currency part which is

1762
01:34:37,824 --> 01:34:38,336
To the next one

1763
01:34:39,104 --> 01:34:40,896
Where do I bleed

1764
01:34:41,408 --> 01:34:47,040
Real quick something

1765
01:34:47,296 --> 01:34:49,344
He's presenting that is a

1766
01:34:49,600 --> 01:34:53,184
Bad thing

1767
01:34:53,440 --> 01:34:58,048
What is trying to happen

1768
01:34:58,304 --> 01:35:00,096
The world is trying to change into

1769
01:35:03,680 --> 01:35:06,496
I believe

1770
01:35:09,568 --> 01:35:10,592
Government

1771
01:35:11,616 --> 01:35:13,152
Govern the entire world

1772
01:35:21,856 --> 01:35:26,464
Absolutely because you can have the Star Trek idea

1773
01:35:26,720 --> 01:35:30,048
The problem is the people running

1774
01:35:30,304 --> 01:35:33,120
Control

1775
01:35:33,632 --> 01:35:34,144
What

1776
01:35:34,912 --> 01:35:36,960
Alex's Alex's

1777
01:35:37,216 --> 01:35:43,360
I agree but here's why that can't happen

1778
01:35:43,616 --> 01:35:44,384
Version that's like

1779
01:35:45,152 --> 01:35:45,664
What

1780
01:35:45,920 --> 01:35:46,432
I feel like

1781
01:35:46,688 --> 01:35:47,200
Alex

1782
01:35:48,736 --> 01:35:50,272
I think that would be cool but

1783
01:35:52,832 --> 01:35:58,976
But no matter who was trying to make that sort of centralized power structure you be like

1784
01:36:02,048 --> 01:36:07,168
The idea that he's open to the idea of One World Government just not this one world government

1785
01:36:07,680 --> 01:36:08,192
Is like

1786
01:36:09,984 --> 01:36:10,496
What

1787
01:36:11,008 --> 01:36:14,080
That's so different than what he normally says

1788
01:36:14,336 --> 01:36:15,360
B a b

1789
01:36:15,872 --> 01:36:18,432
Ludacris

1790
01:36:21,504 --> 01:36:27,648
Piper sing a one world government structure

1791
01:36:27,904 --> 01:36:34,048
Contextualize thing in the first clip he did

1792
01:36:34,304 --> 01:36:39,680
Is trying to grow

1793
01:36:39,936 --> 01:36:46,080
But it lasts maybe a One World Government

1794
01:36:46,336 --> 01:36:47,360
What are they talking about

1795
01:36:47,616 --> 01:36:53,248
About everything

1796
01:36:53,760 --> 01:36:54,272
Probably at 8

1797
01:36:56,576 --> 01:36:57,088
Probably used

1798
01:36:58,624 --> 01:36:59,392
You're right

1799
01:36:59,648 --> 01:37:01,696
You're right

1800
01:37:08,352 --> 01:37:10,656
One world order

1801
01:37:13,472 --> 01:37:15,264
What's a good one Alex

1802
01:37:18,848 --> 01:37:19,360
White

1803
01:37:19,616 --> 01:37:20,384
Graphic colonel

1804
01:37:23,712 --> 01:37:29,856
There's a lot of examples over the years that I've been able to completely and validating his own principles

1805
01:37:31,136 --> 01:37:31,904
Do you think when

1806
01:37:34,976 --> 01:37:35,488
This is so fun

1807
01:37:36,768 --> 01:37:37,792
Fired or resigned

1808
01:37:38,304 --> 01:37:39,328
Who is the Breitbart

1809
01:37:45,472 --> 01:37:45,984
If

1810
01:37:46,240 --> 01:37:46,752
Everybody

1811
01:37:50,080 --> 01:37:50,592
Call Alex

1812
01:37:53,664 --> 01:37:55,200
If Alice

1813
01:37:56,224 --> 01:38:02,368
There's no way he was going to Special Report immediately

1814
01:38:03,392 --> 01:38:09,536
That would be a

1815
01:38:12,608 --> 01:38:15,168
He's dumb as the day is long but he's a good kid

1816
01:38:15,424 --> 01:38:16,960
David Knight I'll keep them in order

1817
01:38:17,472 --> 01:38:20,032
Yeah I think you cared

1818
01:38:20,288 --> 01:38:20,800
Everyone else

1819
01:38:21,056 --> 01:38:24,384
I think if you could dummy the

1820
01:38:24,640 --> 01:38:29,504
Sending number you know like make it look like it's coming from d.c.

1821
01:38:33,856 --> 01:38:34,624
Alright

1822
01:38:38,464 --> 01:38:40,512
Someone to do like a Steve pieczenik

1823
01:38:40,768 --> 01:38:42,304
Compression

1824
01:38:42,560 --> 01:38:44,096
The president

1825
01:38:45,376 --> 01:38:46,400
What's up I think

1826
01:38:46,656 --> 01:38:50,752
Scouts knows what Jared Kushner or Steve Miller sound like

1827
01:38:51,008 --> 01:38:56,384
She could have someone doing impression of either of them it could sound like you were I would really matter

1828
01:38:56,640 --> 01:39:01,248
Refresca

1829
01:39:01,504 --> 01:39:02,272
It's me Jared Kushner

1830
01:39:04,064 --> 01:39:04,832
My father-in-law in a minute

1831
01:39:14,816 --> 01:39:20,960
My father-in-law really like that

1832
01:39:21,216 --> 01:39:22,240
Propagate.

1833
01:39:22,496 --> 01:39:24,032
Dad is always impressed

1834
01:39:24,288 --> 01:39:25,824
Dad's always

1835
01:39:26,336 --> 01:39:27,104
No Daddy

1836
01:39:27,360 --> 01:39:28,896
Daddy

1837
01:39:29,920 --> 01:39:30,432
Always thought your

1838
01:39:32,224 --> 01:39:32,736
Smartass

1839
01:39:35,808 --> 01:39:38,880
Alonzo you're trying to rehabilitate

1840
01:39:39,136 --> 01:39:40,672
Career of Milo yiannopoulos

1841
01:39:41,440 --> 01:39:43,744
Love that you love white people so much

1842
01:39:44,256 --> 01:39:48,352
What happened

1843
01:39:48,608 --> 01:39:50,400
But are you

1844
01:39:50,656 --> 01:39:51,168
Willing to shave

1845
01:39:57,568 --> 01:40:02,432
Even if you would have been like are you willing to grow

1846
01:40:03,968 --> 01:40:04,736
Ground a bed for a while

1847
01:40:11,136 --> 01:40:12,928
I only know that threat because I

1848
01:40:13,440 --> 01:40:14,720
You literally hated link

1849
01:40:14,976 --> 01:40:17,024
Yep he has zero personality

1850
01:40:17,280 --> 01:40:18,816
And I want to put him in a walker

1851
01:40:19,840 --> 01:40:22,912
Crazy people triggered like my boobies

1852
01:40:23,168 --> 01:40:23,936
Two big dogs

1853
01:40:24,448 --> 01:40:25,728
I'm not really but like

1854
01:40:27,520 --> 01:40:29,056
I'm glad I know who they are and

1855
01:40:29,312 --> 01:40:30,336
And I've also wondered

1856
01:40:30,592 --> 01:40:32,640
How there I have a good research I like

1857
01:40:32,896 --> 01:40:34,944
Was like how or why did Google acquire

1858
01:40:35,200 --> 01:40:35,712
Popular

1859
01:40:36,224 --> 01:40:37,248
It's one of those

1860
01:40:37,760 --> 01:40:43,904
Cuz we were in on the ground floor did it everyday I guess I meant their stuff like hot ones that I think is really great

1861
01:40:44,160 --> 01:40:46,208
2 million View

1862
01:40:46,464 --> 01:40:48,000
I understand why people watch this

1863
01:40:48,512 --> 01:40:53,888
And there's other things that I don't

1864
01:40:54,144 --> 01:40:54,656
I get it

1865
01:40:54,912 --> 01:40:55,424
Yeah

1866
01:40:56,704 --> 01:40:58,240
There's also a lots of boring

1867
01:40:59,520 --> 01:41:02,080
Holyshit

1868
01:41:02,592 --> 01:41:08,736
Maybe you don't want to hear about lizard people

1869
01:41:10,272 --> 01:41:10,784
Absolutely

1870
01:41:11,040 --> 01:41:13,088
So next clip

1871
01:41:13,344 --> 01:41:14,368
Man

1872
01:41:15,392 --> 01:41:21,536
So at this point Piper is just been stupid in the sense that like he respects out

1873
01:41:23,328 --> 01:41:23,840
I was so excited

1874
01:41:25,888 --> 01:41:27,424
Either she was going to have Vince Russo and

1875
01:41:29,984 --> 01:41:30,496
For a long time

1876
01:41:31,776 --> 01:41:34,080
You're a cancer in the wrestling business right

1877
01:41:34,336 --> 01:41:36,128
Because of you own heart died

1878
01:41:36,896 --> 01:41:37,664
Heavy duty shed

1879
01:41:38,432 --> 01:41:41,248
I thought about it you're a daddy

1880
01:41:41,760 --> 01:41:42,528
You're trying to provide for

1881
01:41:44,576 --> 01:41:47,136
You're just trying to provide for your children and I got no beef

1882
01:41:48,416 --> 01:41:48,928
Sounds like

1883
01:41:49,184 --> 01:41:52,256
It was his baby built it up and everything

1884
01:41:53,024 --> 01:41:53,792
Your daddy

1885
01:41:55,328 --> 01:41:56,864
The same time it's kind of adult

1886
01:41:58,912 --> 01:42:00,448
No

1887
01:42:00,704 --> 01:42:02,752
Ducksters

1888
01:42:04,288 --> 01:42:07,104
The only thing is that he respects our

1889
01:42:07,360 --> 01:42:10,176
Sure unfortunately he's going to say something

1890
01:42:10,944 --> 01:42:11,968
That is a vegetable

1891
01:42:13,504 --> 01:42:15,296
It all it all stars

1892
01:42:23,488 --> 01:42:24,256
For the kids

1893
01:42:27,072 --> 01:42:32,704
Piece of music that made

1894
01:42:46,784 --> 01:42:49,088
Early 60s

1895
01:42:51,136 --> 01:42:53,184
The people that bought it

1896
01:42:53,696 --> 01:42:57,536
Got to go to work and come back home

1897
01:43:02,656 --> 01:43:06,240
TV

1898
01:43:07,008 --> 01:43:12,384
Commercial came on and made you buy

1899
01:43:12,896 --> 01:43:14,944
Early sixties

1900
01:43:15,200 --> 01:43:17,760
How sophisticated they are now

1901
01:43:18,784 --> 01:43:19,808
Holyshit

1902
01:43:20,064 --> 01:43:20,576
Oh man

1903
01:43:20,832 --> 01:43:21,856
What do you think about that

1904
01:43:22,112 --> 01:43:22,624
I think

1905
01:43:24,672 --> 01:43:25,440
I think the hot rod

1906
01:43:28,256 --> 01:43:28,768
The Conspiracy to

1907
01:43:29,280 --> 01:43:31,584
Do you know what the Brunswick Affair is

1908
01:43:31,840 --> 01:43:33,376
Is the television show

1909
01:43:33,632 --> 01:43:34,144
That was

1910
01:43:35,680 --> 01:43:37,472
It was like the Twilight Zone

1911
01:43:37,728 --> 01:43:43,872
Okay this episode is a mockumentary types

1912
01:43:44,128 --> 01:43:46,176
Style TV program

1913
01:43:46,432 --> 01:43:50,784
It came out that talks about TV sets that were put out in the 60 okay

1914
01:43:51,040 --> 01:43:54,112
That is not true so he's talking about this mockumentary

1915
01:43:54,624 --> 01:43:55,392
For real

1916
01:43:55,648 --> 01:44:01,792
It's like a Twilight Zone episode

1917
01:44:02,048 --> 01:44:08,192
Reality interesting ideas during something before

1918
01:44:08,448 --> 01:44:08,960
1/4

1919
01:44:09,984 --> 01:44:10,496
Message

1920
01:44:11,008 --> 01:44:11,520
Sure

1921
01:44:12,288 --> 01:44:15,616
Advertising is an ethical practice

1922
01:44:16,128 --> 01:44:19,712
But what specifically what he's talking about

1923
01:44:20,224 --> 01:44:23,296
And it's nonsense because the dates don't match up

1924
01:44:23,552 --> 01:44:25,856
In order to avoid getting sued they change the name

1925
01:44:26,112 --> 01:44:27,904
From the like of the Brunswick

1926
01:44:28,160 --> 01:44:30,976
Radio and TV

Creative license

1928
01:44:35,840 --> 01:44:41,984
I don't know but that's actually really famous example of absolutely

1929
01:44:45,312 --> 01:44:48,384
Brunswick but what the f*** you talking about

1930
01:44:49,920 --> 01:44:51,456
Popstar

1931
01:44:52,736 --> 01:44:57,600
He said these new pop stars come out and say dirty things

1932
01:44:57,856 --> 01:45:04,000
What did you do for professional wrestling

1933
01:45:04,256 --> 01:45:06,560
But I think I think Rod is a guy who probably saw

1934
01:45:07,072 --> 01:45:07,584
Some

1935
01:45:08,864 --> 01:45:10,144
Pop star Illuminati videos

1936
01:45:11,168 --> 01:45:17,312
Anime I think they probably I think he's a guy who is the one eye covered devil horns

1937
01:45:18,848 --> 01:45:22,688
Baby goes to vigilantcitizen.com guys who were so

1938
01:45:22,944 --> 01:45:24,480
While back in the day or now what

1939
01:45:30,368 --> 01:45:31,392
Except that you did

1940
01:45:31,648 --> 01:45:32,928
Forever

1941
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:37,024
Maybe not Rowdy Roddy Piper

1942
01:45:39,072 --> 01:45:40,608
Hellboy

1943
01:45:41,632 --> 01:45:42,144
The map

1944
01:45:42,400 --> 01:45:45,728
Alex Andrade talk about like

1945
01:45:46,240 --> 01:45:48,800
They've gotten into like a bit of a conversation where they're like

1946
01:45:49,312 --> 01:45:51,104
But nothing's really been said

1947
01:45:52,128 --> 01:45:52,640
What do you mean

1948
01:45:53,664 --> 01:45:54,176
Put this dinner

1949
01:45:54,688 --> 01:46:00,832
The same page all is like Alex

1950
01:46:01,088 --> 01:46:07,232
So amazing about

1951
01:46:07,488 --> 01:46:09,024
No

1952
01:46:09,280 --> 01:46:15,424
I didn't know that

1953
01:46:18,496 --> 01:46:20,032
She's right by Pacific

1954
01:46:21,056 --> 01:46:22,336
What did she say

1955
01:46:23,104 --> 01:46:28,736
Because she didn't want to fight that Transit

1956
01:46:29,248 --> 01:46:35,392
I believe she said she wasn't

1957
01:46:35,648 --> 01:46:41,792
I don't want to get this wrong

1958
01:46:45,376 --> 01:46:46,144
So

1959
01:46:46,912 --> 01:46:47,936
But besides that she's

1960
01:46:48,192 --> 01:46:49,472
Fantastic professional wrestler

1961
01:46:49,728 --> 01:46:55,360
She's really I'm not sure she walked some of that back that I think it's some of the same thing except she's

1962
01:46:55,872 --> 01:46:59,200
She seems like she's very dumb like unfortunately

1963
01:46:59,456 --> 01:46:59,968
I think

1964
01:47:00,224 --> 01:47:01,248
Enzo and big Cass

1965
01:47:01,504 --> 01:47:02,528
Both big trumper's

1966
01:47:04,832 --> 01:47:06,880
Well for other reason reasons

1967
01:47:07,136 --> 01:47:07,904
Shut the door

1968
01:47:16,864 --> 01:47:17,632
Previous tax in Outlook

1969
01:47:18,144 --> 01:47:20,704
This picture big Cass with these giant fake titties

1970
01:47:21,472 --> 01:47:22,240

1974
01:47:37,088 --> 01:47:37,600
Gigantic

1978
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:50,144
It's very weird necessarily I don't I don't know all of Rousey's issues fight

1979
01:47:51,936 --> 01:47:52,960
Kind of like when you

Keto slim waist in 30 days

That's like

2005
01:49:15,648 --> 01:49:16,928
That is an

2006
01:49:17,696 --> 01:49:23,840
Marty that's the evolution of weirdo sitting around listening to police scanner

2007
01:49:24,096 --> 01:49:28,704
I knew a bunch of those guys my first house that I lived in

2008
01:49:30,752 --> 01:49:32,288
Not I didn't have one but

2009
01:49:35,360 --> 01:49:36,640
My neighbor my first house

01:49:36,896 --> 01:49:43,040
Dad said one of them was a Vietnam vet the other had stolen valor all day long

Lost his arm

2013
01:49:53,280 --> 01:49:59,424
Made me think of a really long time

2014
01:49:59,680 --> 01:50:05,824
Talk about how bad it wasn't told me how he lost his arm until like 6

2015
01:50:06,080 --> 01:50:12,224
They crashed his car and lost his arm

2016
01:50:14,784 --> 01:50:20,928
So you got a Purple Heart

2017
01:50:21,184 --> 01:50:24,768
Ed was a disaster

2018
01:50:25,280 --> 01:50:27,584
So I would go over their house

2019
01:50:27,840 --> 01:50:32,448
Like it was

2020
01:50:34,752 --> 01:50:39,616

Police scanner

2029
01:51:04,192 --> 01:51:06,240
Police scanner

2078
01:53:29,344 --> 01:53:35,488
And there's a Tornado Launcher guns in the car

2079
01:53:35,744 --> 01:53:37,792
Stop

2080
01:53:39,584 --> 01:53:40,352
Lightish

2081
01:53:40,608 --> 01:53:43,168
It's live-to-tape or whatever but it's not like

2082
01:53:43,424 --> 01:53:44,704
The show is happening

2083
01:53:46,240 --> 01:53:50,336
It can't be so boring for me

2084
01:53:50,848 --> 01:53:51,872
They know how to jump around

2085
01:53:52,640 --> 01:53:54,944
And some of it is boring that's why you watch the rewind that's

2086
01:53:56,224 --> 01:53:59,040
There was this guy who was evading the cops

2087
01:54:00,320 --> 01:54:01,088
This guy

2088
01:54:01,344 --> 01:54:03,904
Was such a good driver it was like Dukes of Hazzard like

2089
01:54:04,160 --> 01:54:09,536
Like this f****** guy

2090
01:54:13,376 --> 01:54:14,144
Of course.

2091
01:54:15,424 --> 01:54:21,568
It's like the cop version and the guy passengers got his hands on

2092
01:54:21,824 --> 01:54:25,664
I just got the wrong car

2093
01:54:25,920 --> 01:54:26,688
Squaring the situation

2094
01:54:26,944 --> 01:54:27,456
Just say

2095
01:54:27,712 --> 01:54:28,736
IForce

2096
01:54:29,504 --> 01:54:33,344
Just put your hands out the car window another charge

2097
01:54:34,624 --> 01:54:35,648
And this guy was

2098
01:54:35,904 --> 01:54:36,416
Just like

2099
01:54:36,672 --> 01:54:40,256
The back bumper

2100
01:54:40,512 --> 01:54:41,280
Flipper

2101
01:54:41,536 --> 01:54:47,680
Couldn't do it now bump this guy tracks out the tracks out and just

2102
01:54:49,728 --> 01:54:50,240
Maven

2103
01:54:59,200 --> 01:55:02,784
I notice a lot of people that I follow unfollow

2104
01:55:03,552 --> 01:55:04,320
That was sweet about it

2105
01:55:04,576 --> 01:55:05,856
This is like

2106
01:55:06,880 --> 01:55:09,952
Interesting thing that I'm experiencing now is like someone who is just like

2107
01:55:10,208 --> 01:55:12,000
Completely out of it

2108
01:55:12,256 --> 01:55:18,400
There are shows like that is exactly what I want to watch

2109
01:55:18,656 --> 01:55:19,680
Wait for you baby

2110
01:55:19,936 --> 01:55:23,008
There are times where I feel bad cuz it's all mostly poor

2111
01:55:23,520 --> 01:55:27,616
And most cops ever

2112
01:55:33,248 --> 01:55:34,528
I think there's kind of a gross

2113
01:55:34,784 --> 01:55:40,928
Voyeurism

2114
01:55:41,184 --> 01:55:47,328
Almost all of those shows are like My Strange Addiction

2115
01:55:47,584 --> 01:55:49,120
Water

2116
01:55:49,376 --> 01:55:50,656
Is Trainwreck O's

2117
01:55:50,912 --> 01:55:51,680
Was there an iWatch

2118
01:55:51,936 --> 01:55:52,960
Borders for a little bit

2119
01:55:55,008 --> 01:55:55,520
Apple watch

2120
01:55:55,776 --> 01:55:56,800
And then it just got sad

2121
01:56:02,176 --> 01:56:02,688
And then they just

2122
01:56:03,456 --> 01:56:04,224
Couch and pulled out a day

2123
01:56:05,248 --> 01:56:06,528
Oh no that was like

2124
01:56:06,784 --> 01:56:07,808
As hard as a book

2125
01:56:08,320 --> 01:56:09,344
Hey we got a dead cat

2126
01:56:14,208 --> 01:56:16,768
Dislike how do people live

2127
01:56:17,024 --> 01:56:17,792
Sort of world

2128
01:56:18,048 --> 01:56:18,560
I meant

2129
01:56:19,072 --> 01:56:20,096
With the cop stuff at

2130
01:56:20,352 --> 01:56:21,376
The horror is

2131
01:56:23,424 --> 01:56:27,008
Presumably the protagonist of the show

2132
01:56:27,264 --> 01:56:30,336
Are the characters of the show

2133
01:56:30,592 --> 01:56:33,408
So you're watching it and you're like oh my God

2134
01:56:33,920 --> 01:56:38,272
You're seeing all these people get arrested really f***** up situations

2135
01:56:38,528 --> 01:56:41,088
An awesome life is usually

2136
01:56:41,600 --> 01:56:42,368
Pretty good PR

2137
01:56:42,624 --> 01:56:43,136
Cops

2138
01:56:43,904 --> 01:56:44,672
It shines

2139
01:56:44,928 --> 01:56:45,696
Pretty positive light

2140
01:56:46,976 --> 01:56:50,304
But every wants to make every once in awhile

2141
01:56:50,560 --> 01:56:51,072
What what

2142
01:56:51,328 --> 01:56:52,352
This one I'm still bad

2143
01:56:52,864 --> 01:56:55,168
But there's so many people who aren't like pull this guy over

2144
01:56:56,192 --> 01:56:57,984
Republic sky over there in Durham

2145
01:56:59,008 --> 01:56:59,520
So

2146
01:56:59,776 --> 01:57:01,824
Lakefront from like Indiana Illinois

2147
01:57:02,336 --> 01:57:04,128
Do not like

2148
01:57:04,384 --> 01:57:05,408
So

2149
01:57:10,016 --> 01:57:10,528
So

2150
01:57:10,784 --> 01:57:13,088
Can I grab Indiana

2151
01:57:15,392 --> 01:57:16,160
Illinois

2152
01:57:16,672 --> 01:57:17,184
Oh yeah

2153
01:57:17,440 --> 01:57:19,232
They pulled the sky over hypothetically

2154
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:21,280
Demon in Illinois

2155
01:57:22,048 --> 01:57:23,072
I need an Indiana plate

2156
01:57:25,120 --> 01:57:25,632
Play

2157
01:57:26,144 --> 01:57:28,192
And he's like I live in Indiana

2158
01:57:29,216 --> 01:57:29,728
In Illinois

2159
01:57:29,984 --> 01:57:30,496
Play

2160
01:57:31,008 --> 01:57:32,544
How do you search them if on a bunch of drugs

2161
01:57:34,080 --> 01:57:34,848
Wow that's

2162
01:57:35,104 --> 01:57:36,384
I just saw

2163
01:57:37,920 --> 01:57:39,200
In Minnesota

2164
01:57:41,248 --> 01:57:41,760
Hundreds of pounds

2165
01:57:43,040 --> 01:57:43,808
But the judge threw it out

2166
01:57:48,160 --> 01:57:48,672
No

2167
01:57:48,928 --> 01:57:52,256
That's what b******* about it you should still have that

2168
01:57:52,512 --> 01:57:54,048
We're going to get back to you

2169
01:57:54,304 --> 01:57:56,096
Yeah 10 minutes to get out of here

2170
01:57:56,352 --> 01:57:58,144
I think that's exactly what they should do

2171
01:57:58,400 --> 01:58:04,544
We could we pulled you over under false pretenses that eyebrow we have to create exact

2172
01:58:04,800 --> 01:58:07,872
You were in before we stopped you I love a good fun

2173
01:58:08,896 --> 01:58:09,408
Boston life

2174
01:58:09,664 --> 01:58:10,432
PD like when they

2175
01:58:12,736 --> 01:58:15,296
That's my wife and they separate

2176
01:58:15,808 --> 01:58:18,880
Harmless

2177
01:58:20,672 --> 01:58:21,440
Hey Google turn a

2178
01:58:25,792 --> 01:58:27,072
Shotgun wedding

2179
01:58:27,328 --> 01:58:27,840
I don't know

2180
01:58:28,096 --> 01:58:28,608
Alright maybe

2181
01:58:29,632 --> 01:58:33,728
I feel like there's a lot of harm the alarm

2182
01:58:38,080 --> 01:58:39,104
Good clean fun

2183
01:58:41,664 --> 01:58:42,176
Real life

2184
01:58:42,432 --> 01:58:43,200

We're going to set a date I'm coming over to watch

2188
01:58:53,696 --> 01:58:54,464
Recorded

That's why I love it

2193
01:59:01,376 --> 01:59:04,960
Cancel your gigs coming over on Saturday

2194
01:59:05,472 --> 01:59:05,984
I'll deputize

2195
01:59:09,312 --> 01:59:10,080
Alright sounds good

2196
01:59:10,336 --> 01:59:12,128
Our next episode

2197
01:59:12,640 --> 01:59:13,664
Thorough review

2198
01:59:15,968 --> 01:59:16,736
Watch this

2199
01:59:16,992 --> 01:59:22,624
It's terrible as a problem but like

2200
01:59:23,136 --> 01:59:29,280
The idea of watching it live does trigger that like I said listen to the police scanners when you're younger

2201
01:59:32,608 --> 01:59:33,632
But the only thing

2202
01:59:34,144 --> 01:59:35,680
Against

2203
01:59:35,936 --> 01:59:36,960
Is the

2204
01:59:37,472 --> 01:59:39,520
Sort of the excitement and fetishizing

2205
01:59:41,056 --> 01:59:42,592
The cops doing

2206
01:59:45,408 --> 01:59:50,528
I think I think entertainment value is fine

2207
02:00:03,584 --> 02:00:04,096
Product

2208
02:00:04,352 --> 02:00:04,864
For five years

2209
02:00:09,216 --> 02:00:09,728
Parked

2210
02:00:09,984 --> 02:00:10,496
Ostomy

2211
02:00:13,056 --> 02:00:13,568
But poor black

2212
02:00:17,408 --> 02:00:19,200
What's not working I'm going to walk away

2213
02:00:19,456 --> 02:00:19,968
And then

2214
02:00:23,552 --> 02:00:24,064
TV

2215
02:00:24,576 --> 02:00:25,344
And then they would grab it

2216
02:00:26,112 --> 02:00:26,624
In the back of the

2217
02:00:28,160 --> 02:00:33,792
Charges would never stick

2218
02:00:34,048 --> 02:00:38,912
That's absolutely never fly in court

2219
02:00:39,424 --> 02:00:41,216
If I were in that neighborhood

2220
02:00:41,472 --> 02:00:47,616
I probably wouldn't if I saw a semi with it

2221
02:00:47,872 --> 02:00:51,712
F****** well wouldn't look inside Fair

2222
02:00:51,968 --> 02:00:53,248
Realized

2223
02:00:53,760 --> 02:00:55,040
Stuff you can get away with

2224
02:00:55,808 --> 02:00:56,320
And like stuff

2225
02:00:58,368 --> 02:00:59,904
Walking down the

2226
02:01:01,952 --> 02:01:02,464
There's no crime

2227
02:01:03,744 --> 02:01:05,536
Or like if they're in their house

2228
02:01:07,072 --> 02:01:08,352
How's your husband

2229
02:01:08,608 --> 02:01:09,120
Just real drunk

2230
02:01:09,632 --> 02:01:10,144
Can you please just

2231
02:01:15,520 --> 02:01:16,288
What you doing

2232
02:01:17,312 --> 02:01:17,824
Lick man

2233
02:01:18,592 --> 02:01:19,616
Got to go to bed

2234
02:01:20,128 --> 02:01:24,224
And it's like so fun at like sometimes a cop's job is it to go to a house

2235
02:01:25,248 --> 02:01:27,040
Go to Vatican what time is work tomorrow

2236
02:01:27,296 --> 02:01:28,832
7:30 in the morning

2237
02:01:29,600 --> 02:01:30,624
You're never going to make it

2238
02:01:30,880 --> 02:01:34,208
I guarantee I make it to work I guarantee it

2239
02:01:34,720 --> 02:01:37,280
Kanal D I'd love to watch that

2240
02:01:37,536 --> 02:01:38,304
But not

2241
02:01:38,560 --> 02:01:44,704
Not because that guy is drunk right now is hilarious

2242
02:01:44,960 --> 02:01:47,264
Terrible

2243
02:01:48,800 --> 02:01:53,664
Your job is to try and give good advice

2244
02:01:54,176 --> 02:01:55,968
And she swore her boyfriend was

2245
02:01:56,224 --> 02:01:56,992
Under the floor

2246
02:01:57,760 --> 02:01:58,784
Her ex who cheated on her

2247
02:01:59,040 --> 02:01:59,808
Who's under the

2248
02:02:03,648 --> 02:02:08,512
People are in the floorboard of their in the wall very common delusion

2249
02:02:17,472 --> 02:02:19,264
Now the only thing I would say

2250
02:02:19,520 --> 02:02:20,032
Important

2251
02:02:20,288 --> 02:02:24,896
Is that most of these people were having these like drunk delightful experiences with the tub

2252
02:02:25,152 --> 02:02:25,664
Are white

2253
02:02:25,920 --> 02:02:27,968
And people who

2254
02:02:31,808 --> 02:02:35,648
A charismatic black

2255
02:02:36,928 --> 02:02:43,072
I would say that the number of times black people get jacked up insurance

2256
02:02:43,328 --> 02:02:47,168
It's not going to be on live PD

2257
02:02:50,496 --> 02:02:52,544
I would hope you would not be shot

2258
02:02:53,056 --> 02:02:53,568
But

2259
02:02:53,824 --> 02:02:56,128
You do sometime from watching life

2260
02:02:56,384 --> 02:02:57,408
Some of the

2261
02:02:57,664 --> 02:02:58,176
Distress

2262
02:02:58,432 --> 02:02:59,200
Pressure that job

2263
02:02:59,456 --> 02:03:00,224
Come on

2264
02:03:00,480 --> 02:03:02,016
No dude I'm serious

2265
02:03:02,272 --> 02:03:05,856
They're just like

2266
02:03:06,112 --> 02:03:07,648
Freight

2267
02:03:08,160 --> 02:03:14,304
There's no way you don't think that's what you're signing up for a zygote for sure I know if you can do that with

2268
02:03:14,560 --> 02:03:20,192
Then don't f****** but I'm not saying that I'm just saying there are times when you're like

2269
02:03:20,448 --> 02:03:21,984
And look man

2270
02:03:22,752 --> 02:03:23,264
If

2271
02:03:23,520 --> 02:03:25,568
I was a different cop you might have gotten shot here

2272
02:03:25,824 --> 02:03:26,848
Like I do

2273
02:03:27,360 --> 02:03:28,896
20 years

2274
02:03:29,152 --> 02:03:29,920
I know I know

2275
02:03:30,176 --> 02:03:30,944
What to do

2276
02:03:31,200 --> 02:03:34,016
But s*** man like dude I almost had to shoot you

2277
02:03:34,272 --> 02:03:37,600
Look at you keep running after gun shoot

2278
02:03:38,112 --> 02:03:41,184
Probably should shoot

2279
02:03:41,440 --> 02:03:42,464
You can't do that

2280
02:03:42,720 --> 02:03:43,744
Like what are you doing

2281
02:03:44,512 --> 02:03:50,656
A postgame after I saw you running at me

2282
02:03:50,912 --> 02:03:54,240
I love

2283
02:03:56,544 --> 02:04:02,688
Dog Bounty Hunter all the time

2284
02:04:19,072 --> 02:04:20,864
How are you doing

2285
02:04:21,120 --> 02:04:22,656
I like

2286
02:04:24,704 --> 02:04:25,728
Yeah I thought of

2287
02:04:29,056 --> 02:04:35,200
Those caught in a career

2288
02:04:44,416 --> 02:04:47,744
All right so far

2289
02:04:48,768 --> 02:04:51,328
So it's interesting actually that talkin about

2290
02:04:51,840 --> 02:04:53,632
Cop show for as long as

2291
02:04:53,888 --> 02:04:54,656
Because

2292
02:04:55,168 --> 02:04:58,240
Alex like I said

2293
02:05:00,800 --> 02:05:03,616
Alex and Piper have been having conversation about like

2294
02:05:04,128 --> 02:05:08,992
Why does why does everybody else not feed

2295
02:05:09,504 --> 02:05:10,016
Glasses

2296
02:05:13,344 --> 02:05:14,368
Alex

2297
02:05:14,624 --> 02:05:17,184
Something

2298
02:05:17,952 --> 02:05:18,464
Live PD

2299
02:05:18,720 --> 02:05:19,488
Taking my shower

2300
02:05:20,512 --> 02:05:24,352
Can I think you just answered my question there that I said at the beginning of the break

2301
02:05:24,608 --> 02:05:29,728
Who makes those of us that are immune or resistance

2302
02:05:29,984 --> 02:05:30,752
The program

2303
02:05:31,008 --> 02:05:33,568
We grew up as individual

2304
02:05:33,824 --> 02:05:36,384
Grew up in had a brush with the streets

2305
02:05:39,200 --> 02:05:42,528
It was a lot of fights a lot of corrupt police government drug dealing

2306
02:05:42,784 --> 02:05:46,624
A lot of police running hookers you name it and I grew up

2307
02:05:47,136 --> 02:05:53,280
Watching this going on in my neighborhood

2308
02:05:58,144 --> 02:06:01,472
I put the sunglasses on because I saw the other side

2309
02:06:01,728 --> 02:06:04,800
And saw how naive everybody

2310
02:06:05,056 --> 02:06:07,616
They want to get to use them down

2311
02:06:08,128 --> 02:06:10,176
Take it all a bunch of political correctness

2312
02:06:13,248 --> 02:06:14,016
Bulshit

2313
02:06:14,784 --> 02:06:16,832
You know how to make sandwiches

2314
02:06:17,344 --> 02:06:18,112
A cop pulled out

2315
02:06:18,368 --> 02:06:20,160
A cop busted Alex and his friends

2316
02:06:28,608 --> 02:06:34,496
Let's talk about that he started talking about I never seen white racism

2317
02:06:35,008 --> 02:06:41,152
I haven't felt like how human bodies were underage with beer in the car driving

2318
02:06:41,408 --> 02:06:47,552
Back from like a party at the beach like that

2319
02:06:49,600 --> 02:06:50,624
You kids have a good night

2320
02:06:50,880 --> 02:06:53,696
I'm like I was here just a few just described

2321
02:06:53,952 --> 02:06:55,744
Very clear white racism

2322
02:06:56,000 --> 02:06:59,072
Just because it didn't hurt a black guy cop again

2323
02:06:59,328 --> 02:07:00,352
No he's

2324
02:07:00,608 --> 02:07:06,240
Back then he's talking about the corruption.

2325
02:07:06,496 --> 02:07:08,032
They threatened to kill

2326
02:07:08,800 --> 02:07:09,824
Again Rockwall Texas

2327
02:07:10,080 --> 02:07:16,224
30/30 150

2328
02:07:16,480 --> 02:07:21,088
A bunch of research into his Dad recently

2329
02:07:21,344 --> 02:07:22,880
Was ever involved in any

2330
02:07:25,952 --> 02:07:26,720
He's been a dentist

2331
02:07:26,976 --> 02:07:31,328
Simpsons I like 1980 Something About no longer than that

2332
02:07:32,352 --> 02:07:35,680
He he claims that he was a dentist to some CIA agent

2333
02:07:36,192 --> 02:07:37,472
And that's sort of the closest

2334
02:07:37,728 --> 02:07:43,616
You can get to anything substantial but

2335
02:07:44,384 --> 02:07:50,528
Man there was this there's his dad his dad

2336
02:07:51,552 --> 02:07:57,696
We know that because two employees of sued him for EEOC

2337
02:07:58,464 --> 02:08:03,328
And his dad had to go on record as the person who runs resource department

2338
02:08:03,584 --> 02:08:04,096
How do you say

2339
02:08:04,352 --> 02:08:04,864
Hey look

2340
02:08:05,376 --> 02:08:08,960
The locker room here tirement

2341
02:08:09,216 --> 02:08:14,336
F*** you lock her up

2342
02:08:15,616 --> 02:08:19,456
Sometimes Rob do says she knows now I don't know

2343
02:08:19,712 --> 02:08:21,504
This is Robby Rob baby Rob

2344
02:08:22,016 --> 02:08:23,808
I just think I don't believe any of this

2345
02:08:26,880 --> 02:08:30,976
That's just stuff that the internet keeps repeating narrative

2346
02:08:31,232 --> 02:08:35,584
Alex Jones Mossad Israel

2347
02:08:35,840 --> 02:08:41,984
Or the government or something like that much simpler he's a two-bit also whites

2348
02:08:42,240 --> 02:08:46,848
He explains his entire career you don't need the intelligence

2349
02:08:47,104 --> 02:08:48,640
Who's being used by

2350
02:08:49,664 --> 02:08:50,432
For now the Press

2351
02:08:50,944 --> 02:08:52,736
The president of Russia also

2352
02:08:54,784 --> 02:09:00,160
I think that connection is much looser I think that what is Rodger Stone

2353
02:09:00,416 --> 02:09:00,928
Rodger Stone

2354
02:09:02,720 --> 02:09:03,488
You thinks he's very stupid

2355
02:09:06,560 --> 02:09:11,168
Yeah totally Isaac 2013

2356
02:09:11,424 --> 02:09:13,216
I know they met at JFK convention

2357
02:09:13,728 --> 02:09:14,496
I think that

2358
02:09:14,752 --> 02:09:17,824
A Rodger Stone probably immediately recognized

2359
02:09:18,080 --> 02:09:18,848
Very

2360
02:09:20,128 --> 02:09:21,408
Competent person

2361
02:09:24,224 --> 02:09:26,016
The stupid and compromisable

2362
02:09:29,344 --> 02:09:32,416
Rodger left Trump campaign

2363
02:09:32,672 --> 02:09:36,768
Propaganda outside realize Alex's perfect

2364
02:09:41,376 --> 02:09:45,984
And who knows if it was money or just being like nationalist

2365
02:09:46,240 --> 02:09:48,288
Further the goals that you

2366
02:09:49,312 --> 02:09:50,592
It's very clear that's what you're about

2367
02:09:50,848 --> 02:09:53,408
Do you think that stone white nationalist

2368
02:09:54,688 --> 02:09:55,968
I figured he doesn't have principles

2369
02:09:56,480 --> 02:09:57,760
Evan Gattis

2370
02:09:58,016 --> 02:10:02,880
I think it's a Chaos Agent like to the very definition

2371
02:10:03,392 --> 02:10:05,184
Nihilist

2372
02:10:05,696 --> 02:10:08,768
I didn't even care based on the people he buddies up

2373
02:10:09,280 --> 02:10:10,048
I don't think that

2374
02:10:11,072 --> 02:10:15,936
I think it'd be impossible to do that without being sympathetic to White nationalism and white Superman

2375
02:10:16,192 --> 02:10:17,984
But I don't know

2376
02:10:18,240 --> 02:10:18,752
From

2377
02:10:22,592 --> 02:10:24,128
There's such a trend of like

2378
02:10:24,384 --> 02:10:27,200
It seems like he's f****** around that like

2379
02:10:27,712 --> 02:10:33,856
I feel like he just like I'm certain he's got a deal

2380
02:10:35,392 --> 02:10:36,160
Are you just doing this

2381
02:10:42,816 --> 02:10:48,960
Well yes of course I did talk to that guy like that sort of stuff

2382
02:10:49,472 --> 02:10:53,312
That there's that there's a feeling of invulnerability

2383
02:10:53,568 --> 02:10:57,408
Did I don't get from a lot of other people

2384
02:11:00,736 --> 02:11:02,528
Want me

2385
02:11:02,784 --> 02:11:05,600
F*** the Democrats the f*** everybody

2386
02:11:05,856 --> 02:11:06,880
That's what that's what I get for

2387
02:11:07,392 --> 02:11:10,464
Chaos chaos chaos

2388
02:11:10,720 --> 02:11:15,584
I don't think he has any like hard-and-fast alliances to nationalism

2389
02:11:15,840 --> 02:11:19,424
The Russia to

2390
02:11:19,680 --> 02:11:22,496
Absolutely

2391
02:11:24,288 --> 02:11:25,312
In the same boat

2392
02:11:25,568 --> 02:11:26,848
So he's very competent

2393
02:11:27,360 --> 02:11:30,176
Like much of the Plains Indians

2394
02:11:30,432 --> 02:11:36,576
Does anyone in our boat hates to admit like that sort of thing but like I was an amazing podcaster

2395
02:11:36,832 --> 02:11:38,112
Sky

2396
02:11:38,368 --> 02:11:41,696
He's really good at propaganda

2397
02:11:41,952 --> 02:11:42,464
He finally

2398
02:11:42,976 --> 02:11:43,488
Ghost

2399
02:11:44,768 --> 02:11:45,792
You know again

2400
02:11:46,048 --> 02:11:46,560
Trump

2401
02:11:47,072 --> 02:11:47,840
What do you want to know

2402
02:11:48,352 --> 02:11:51,680
They could be using to be like the guy

2403
02:11:51,936 --> 02:11:53,216
You can wear

2404
02:11:53,472 --> 02:11:56,288
Lucky Luciano

2405
02:11:59,360 --> 02:12:04,992
Where was the first flip

2406
02:12:05,248 --> 02:12:06,528
I don't think it'll ever come to that

2407
02:12:06,784 --> 02:12:08,576
Cuz I don't think you need that kind of information

2408
02:12:08,832 --> 02:12:09,856
Rodger prison

2409
02:12:10,112 --> 02:12:10,624
Now

2410
02:12:11,136 --> 02:12:11,904
I think it's got a deal

2411
02:12:13,184 --> 02:12:14,464
I'm almost certain he's got a deal

2412
02:12:14,720 --> 02:12:16,768
Part of the deal

2413
02:12:17,280 --> 02:12:17,792
I'm going to cut this

2414
02:12:18,048 --> 02:12:19,328
Is deal part of the deal

2415
02:12:20,352 --> 02:12:22,656
I cut this deal to Argentina

2416
02:12:22,912 --> 02:12:23,424
I'm going to

2417
02:12:23,680 --> 02:12:24,960
Be doing a podcast

2418
02:12:25,216 --> 02:12:31,360
Not just someone who keeps hot

2419
02:12:31,872 --> 02:12:35,968
Rodger ends up showing up on Infowars like in Indio

2420
02:12:36,224 --> 02:12:39,808
Might wanna be close to the Border

2421
02:12:40,064 --> 02:12:41,856
He seems like the kind of guy looking at movies

2422
02:12:42,112 --> 02:12:42,624
White suit

2423
02:12:44,928 --> 02:12:46,976
Indoor crowd

2424
02:12:47,232 --> 02:12:48,256
Like the end of that

2425
02:12:48,512 --> 02:12:49,024
But sounds

2426
02:12:50,560 --> 02:12:52,352
You can't you can't be like

2427
02:12:53,632 --> 02:12:55,936
He was known as a f****** s*** head

2428
02:12:56,192 --> 02:12:57,472
Potster

2429
02:12:57,728 --> 02:12:59,008
30 years ago

2430
02:12:59,264 --> 02:13:01,824
You can't survive this long without being like

2431
02:13:02,592 --> 02:13:03,104
Having EX

2432
02:13:03,360 --> 02:13:06,432
Exit strategies without having like an idea of what's going to happen

2433
02:13:06,688 --> 02:13:08,224
He's never been this much of a marquis

2434
02:13:08,480 --> 02:13:10,528
Key player in the things that are happening

2435
02:13:10,784 --> 02:13:12,320
Politically

2436
02:13:14,112 --> 02:13:14,880
I don't

2437
02:13:15,392 --> 02:13:21,280
Think that he wouldn't have an exit strategy in that power

2438
02:13:22,816 --> 02:13:23,328
Hey man

2439
02:13:23,584 --> 02:13:25,888
Looks like I'm going to go down for some of the stuff

2440
02:13:26,400 --> 02:13:27,168
So

2441
02:13:27,680 --> 02:13:28,704
You politician

2442
02:13:29,216 --> 02:13:31,520
Good word for me

2443
02:13:32,032 --> 02:13:32,800
Otherwise I'd hate

2444
02:13:33,056 --> 02:13:35,616

I mean

2498
02:16:46,080 --> 02:16:52,224
I think that I think that some of that is unavoidable sure no matter what

2499
02:16:52,480 --> 02:16:54,016
Some people in it that are like

2500
02:16:54,528 --> 02:16:56,832
But I think it's probably 8%

2501
02:16:59,136 --> 02:17:02,464
Rarely

2502
02:17:02,976 --> 02:17:03,744

What reporter pointless question

2530
02:18:23,360 --> 02:18:25,408
If someone Works coming to me like that

2531
02:18:26,176 --> 02:18:29,504
Word like accurate representation

2532
02:18:29,760 --> 02:18:31,040
Thanks for opening my eyes to

2533
02:18:31,552 --> 02:18:32,576
Jews taking over

2534
02:18:33,600 --> 02:18:36,928
Talk to them for a bit and hope that I could correct some of those perception

2535
02:18:37,184 --> 02:18:40,256
You listen to Alex so I don't have to thanks for cutting out and just

2536

Sincerely try to like

2538
02:18:45,632 --> 02:18:51,776
See where the disconnect was yeah yeah

2539
02:18:52,032 --> 02:18:58,176
Federal out of this stuff there's nothing I can do maybe you should stop listening to my or something like that

2540
02:18:58,432 --> 02:18:59,968
Figured you might not get it

2541
02:19:00,224 --> 02:19:00,736
Yeah

2542
02:19:00,992 --> 02:19:01,760
But

2543
02:19:05,088 --> 02:19:10,208
The first one clearly

2544
02:19:10,464 --> 02:19:12,768
But Rowdy Roddy Piper

2545
02:19:13,280 --> 02:19:14,304
Piper has a slightly different

2546
02:19:14,560 --> 02:19:15,072
Take on it

2547
02:19:19,168 --> 02:19:22,496
Johnstone help thing

2548
02:19:23,264 --> 02:19:29,408
Dominatrix know where that story came from

2549
02:19:33,248 --> 02:19:36,320
Who they really are and it does he really believe

2550
02:19:36,576 --> 02:19:39,648
Who is this

2551
02:19:46,560 --> 02:19:51,936
They was the propaganda

2552
02:20:06,016 --> 02:20:10,112
Again I don't think the only

2553
02:20:11,648 --> 02:20:16,256
I don't think we're the only living

2554
02:20:16,512 --> 02:20:17,536
Universe

2555
02:20:19,840 --> 02:20:25,472
Big committees right now getting together and staying talking about

2556
02:20:27,008 --> 02:20:33,152
People bar excuse me

2557
02:20:36,224 --> 02:20:37,760
That detailed weather

2558
02:20:54,144 --> 02:20:57,984
Would not see that far

2559
02:20:58,496 --> 02:20:59,008
Maybe

2560
02:20:59,264 --> 02:21:05,408
It's literally

2561
02:21:07,968 --> 02:21:08,480
Alright

2562
02:21:09,504 --> 02:21:10,016
Go to

2563
02:21:11,808 --> 02:21:12,832
I don't know man like

2564
02:21:13,088 --> 02:21:17,184
So one caller is like it's of the Jews

2565
02:21:18,208 --> 02:21:20,768
Stone is like trying to fix a little bit

2566
02:21:21,024 --> 02:21:21,792
Who are they

2567
02:21:22,048 --> 02:21:24,352
Literal aliens

2568
02:21:26,912 --> 02:21:27,424
Blueface

2569
02:21:28,704 --> 02:21:31,264
What did you just drystar there

2570
02:21:34,336 --> 02:21:35,104
Just doodling a little

2571
02:21:36,640 --> 02:21:39,968
I thought that was some

2572
02:21:40,992 --> 02:21:41,504
For the first move

2573
02:21:42,528 --> 02:21:43,040
Perfect

2574
02:21:43,296 --> 02:21:44,320
Sure second one

2575
02:21:44,832 --> 02:21:46,368
That's terrible

2576
02:21:46,624 --> 02:21:51,232
Commercial

2577
02:21:51,744 --> 02:21:54,048
Pressure

2578
02:21:54,304 --> 02:21:55,072
Perfect

2579
02:21:59,168 --> 02:21:59,936
The main event

2580
02:22:00,192 --> 02:22:06,336
Maybe I don't know I think the opening just be like the revelation

2581
02:22:06,592 --> 02:22:09,408
Roddy Piper was on Infowars

2582
02:22:09,920 --> 02:22:15,040
Over and over again Gore Vidal was on Infowars

2583
02:22:15,552 --> 02:22:18,880
Henry Rollins

2584
02:22:19,136 --> 02:22:23,744
Not so much of a disappointment to any of us that Billy Corgan

2585
02:22:27,840 --> 02:22:29,632
Argues with Alex

2586
02:22:35,776 --> 02:22:38,080
I just great

2587
02:22:40,640 --> 02:22:41,408
Nah that's not

2588
02:22:41,920 --> 02:22:42,432
Alex

2589
02:22:42,688 --> 02:22:43,712
Here's why you're wrong

2590
02:22:47,296 --> 02:22:49,088
Also I've noticed

2591
02:22:49,344 --> 02:22:51,648
If you listen carefully to a lot of the piper

2592
02:22:51,904 --> 02:22:53,440
Yeah there's a number of like

2593
02:22:53,696 --> 02:22:56,512
Sound that he makes that are very Ventura

2594
02:22:56,768 --> 02:22:58,816
Don't have some similar vocalpad

2595
02:22:59,840 --> 02:23:00,864
Anyway

2596
02:23:03,680 --> 02:23:04,192
Probably

2597
02:23:05,216 --> 02:23:06,752
Serially from Scotland

2598
02:23:07,264 --> 02:23:11,360
Course

2599
02:23:12,128 --> 02:23:14,432
Rowdy Roddy Piper

2600
02:23:14,688 --> 02:23:15,712
Has an interesting response

2601
02:23:16,736 --> 02:23:21,088
Missouri

2602
02:23:22,368 --> 02:23:28,512
A gentleman and they lived at the underground tunnel system underground base system my question is

2603
02:23:29,024 --> 02:23:32,608
Some people think the Denver International is like the super secret

2604
02:23:33,120 --> 02:23:36,704
A Spaceport whatever you guys going to call her

2605
02:23:37,216 --> 02:23:42,336
Yes I mean I guess my question is do you think it's you don't like the movie they say it's almost like alien

2606
02:23:42,848 --> 02:23:47,456
Does that mean against Rowdy Oriental that's what does he think that you know so he put two and two together like that

2607
02:24:03,328 --> 02:24:05,888
You need to stand up against

2608
02:24:06,144 --> 02:24:09,984
Yesterday

2609
02:24:10,240 --> 02:24:11,264
After meeting

2610
02:24:12,288 --> 02:24:13,056
Variety

2611
02:24:14,336 --> 02:24:16,384
12 Rodney

2612
02:24:16,640 --> 02:24:17,152
12

2613
02:24:17,664 --> 02:24:19,712
Alrighty this is so disappointing

2614
02:24:20,224 --> 02:24:20,736
He watches a lot

2615
02:24:21,504 --> 02:24:27,648
It seems like maybe a lot of YouTube and machines and

2616
02:24:27,904 --> 02:24:34,048
Getting all the information medicinal marijuana

2617
02:24:34,304 --> 02:24:36,608
Blue horse

2618
02:24:37,888 --> 02:24:40,192
Also it's interesting that

2619
02:24:40,448 --> 02:24:40,960
Is that right

2620
02:24:41,216 --> 02:24:42,752
Blucifer

2621
02:24:43,264 --> 02:24:43,776
I think I saw

2622
02:24:44,288 --> 02:24:44,800
The time is up

2623
02:24:45,824 --> 02:24:47,104
Whatever the least was

2624
02:24:49,408 --> 02:24:50,176
Faulty Construction

2625
02:24:53,760 --> 02:24:57,344
Have you and I know because we didn't episode about this

2626
02:25:06,304 --> 02:25:09,632
That lead from a horrible situation into

2627
02:25:09,888 --> 02:25:11,680
A+ you for the future

2628
02:25:11,936 --> 02:25:14,752
The whole backstory

2629

Like Rowdy Roddy Piper

2640
02:25:41,632 --> 02:25:47,776
You hope that they would be the sort of person who wouldn't offer these things up without

These people travel the world

2650
02:26:38,464 --> 02:26:39,744
People who talk to them

2651
02:26:46,656 --> 02:26:52,800
Liquid coming back from Austin next to a lady on the plane was a sweet lady

2652
02:26:53,056 --> 02:26:56,640
Conversation through most of the flight

2653
02:26:56,896 --> 02:26:57,664
Like it was only like

2654
02:26:57,920 --> 02:27:03,808

Conspiracy stop and they have bonfires where he doesn't like

There's some sort of like maybe a little druidic acting out and stuff like that

2658
02:27:14,816 --> 02:27:20,960
Sort of like I met someone

2659
02:27:21,216 --> 02:27:24,032
Conversation

2660
02:27:24,288 --> 02:27:26,592
We've covered it repeatedly with Alex like

2661
02:27:26,848 --> 02:27:32,992
He's in a hot tub with a globalist globalist

2662
02:27:34,528 --> 02:27:37,088
I wish I was sitting next to Alex on a plane

2663
02:27:37,344 --> 02:27:40,416

2664
02:27:40,672 --> 02:27:44,000

2671
02:28:03,200 --> 02:28:06,528
I don't believe that anybody we might like

2672
02:28:06,784 --> 02:28:10,368
Pakistan Hope Airport

2673
02:28:10,624 --> 02:28:16,768
Severely f***** up and also a magnet for other f*****-up people just like Alex wasn't video with that weird

2674
02:28:17,024 --> 02:28:20,096
Coming up to him being my guide

2675
02:28:20,608 --> 02:28:21,888
It doesn't exist in a vacuum

2676
02:28:22,144 --> 02:28:23,424

2678
02:28:25,984 --> 02:28:31,360

2679
02:28:32,128 --> 02:28:35,456
Maybe one impressum a little bit

2680
02:28:35,712 --> 02:28:38,784
There are so many possibilities I heard

2681
02:28:39,552 --> 02:28:40,064
The sky

2682
02:28:41,600 --> 02:28:42,112
I know the

2683
02:28:42,880 --> 02:28:43,648

Dentist

2685
02:28:46,208 --> 02:28:46,720
This guy

2686
02:28:50,816 --> 02:28:51,584
I'll just say I know

2687
02:28:57,984 --> 02:29:00,032
Hundred percent

2688
02:29:00,288 --> 02:29:02,848
Alex talks about

2689
02:29:03,104 --> 02:29:07,968
Having first-hand knowledge that they are our fish people in tanks with human faces

2690
02:29:08,224 --> 02:29:12,832
And stuff like that who heard it from somebody else

2691
02:29:13,088 --> 02:29:17,440
So it's a third-hand story to Alex

2692
02:29:17,952 --> 02:29:19,744
Third first-hand

2693
02:29:20,000 --> 02:29:21,280
Who knows who that person is

2694
02:29:21,536 --> 02:29:24,096
Steve Quayle ran into an airport or whatever

2695
02:29:32,544 --> 02:29:33,568

And from what I've heard

2698
02:29:40,736 --> 02:29:41,504
He's dumb

2699
02:29:42,272 --> 02:29:44,576

2700
02:29:45,600 --> 02:29:50,464
From whatever to

02:29:50,720 --> 02:29:51,488

You're able to separate art some artists

2722
02:30:55,488 --> 02:30:56,000
God

Chris Benoit wrestler

2725
02:31:00,864 --> 02:31:05,216
You kind of have to to some extent I don't know where the line is necessarily but there is a line

2726
02:31:05,472 --> 02:31:05,984
There's a line

2727
02:31:09,824 --> 02:31:11,872

He was so great

2731
02:31:21,344 --> 02:31:23,136
Then you could never enjoy how Brady was

2732
02:31:23,904 --> 02:31:27,488
But because you already had washer and you had all those feelings

2733
02:31:27,744 --> 02:31:29,792
You never going to be able to get rid of those feelings

2734
02:31:31,072 --> 02:31:32,352
I don't know if that helps

2735
02:31:34,912 --> 02:31:35,936
And you know it

2736
02:31:36,192 --> 02:31:37,216
The wrestling business

2737
02:31:41,312 --> 02:31:42,080
It's a lot of

2738
02:31:42,848 --> 02:31:43,360
Trickery

2739

That

2744
02:31:59,488 --> 02:32:03,328
You think this for twenty years that that's there that's the case

2745
02:32:05,632 --> 02:32:09,984
Just by virtue of

2746

Undercover cops drop a reference to it at some point in an interview

2754
02:32:31,744 --> 02:32:36,096
