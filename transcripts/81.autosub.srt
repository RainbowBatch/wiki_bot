1
00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:02,048
Holding

2
00:00:04,096 --> 00:00:09,728
Alexandra Thurston color

00:00:09,984 --> 00:00:11,520
Jordan

4
00:00:11,776 --> 00:00:12,544
Sit around drink novel

5
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:14,592
Aldi Beverages and talk little bit

6
00:00:18,432 --> 00:00:19,712
Let me ask you a question

7
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:21,504
All right now

8
00:00:22,528 --> 00:00:23,296
1 Train

9
00:00:23,552 --> 00:00:26,112
Is going 5 miles an hour Direct

10
00:00:26,368 --> 00:00:26,880
Play towards Chicago

11
00:00:27,136 --> 00:00:27,904
Okay

12
00:00:28,928 --> 00:00:30,464
Another train is leaving Chicago

13
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:31,232
Headed directly

14
00:00:31,488 --> 00:00:32,000
ClearChoice Austin

15
00:00:33,024 --> 00:00:35,840
Haha

16
00:00:36,096 --> 00:00:37,120
But you don't know which

17
00:00:38,656 --> 00:00:39,424
Would you blow about

18
00:00:40,192 --> 00:00:41,216
I wouldn't

19
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:43,008
Death upon the map

20
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,056
All right but you know a lot about Alex

21
00:00:45,568 --> 00:00:46,336
That's why I have

22
00:00:46,848 --> 00:00:47,360
A lot of

23
00:00:47,616 --> 00:00:49,920
Puppy for this human tragedy that walks

24
00:00:53,504 --> 00:00:55,296
Chances of

25
00:00:55,552 --> 00:00:58,368
All About Us trying to find the middle

26
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:00,928
So we have

27
00:01:01,184 --> 00:01:04,000
Put the makeup Top by in case you did not see on social media

28
00:01:04,256 --> 00:01:04,768
We are

29
00:01:05,024 --> 00:01:11,168
Or show at at North this Saturday

30
00:01:11,424 --> 00:01:12,448
If you want to go to 8 North

31
00:01:12,704 --> 00:01:15,776
Still go ahead and go and have a drink but we will not be there

32
00:01:16,032 --> 00:01:16,800
Jordan

33
00:01:17,056 --> 00:01:22,688
Is 264, remember

34
00:01:23,456 --> 00:01:25,504
We've speculated on Facebook oh that's

35
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:26,784
Chats with the fan

36
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,320
That tights the globalist

37
00:01:28,832 --> 00:01:34,208
Is it the global to book resist the ones who screwed up my schedule

38
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:40,608
They put a hex on you

39
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:42,144
We were super excited about it

40
00:01:42,656 --> 00:01:44,192
But we will do it in the

41
00:01:47,264 --> 00:01:49,568
We get our s*** together

42
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,616
Also another

43
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:53,408
Just podcast is about to

44
00:01:53,664 --> 00:01:54,176
To go into work

Speed

46
00:01:56,736 --> 00:01:58,272
More details as they come

47
00:01:58,528 --> 00:01:59,552
But we will

48
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:00,576
Shortly

49
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:01,600
Start

50
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:02,368
Sting live

51
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:07,488
And this will be a very dangerous proposition

52
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:12,608
Or no call

53
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:14,400
One of the two

54
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,704
Or just one

55
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,496
And somebody's going to be really nice

56
00:02:18,752 --> 00:02:20,800
If possible

57
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:23,104
Cerveza

58
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,896
Back in the freezing point days

59
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:28,992
Was just

60
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:29,760
Comedian friend

61
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:30,784
On the road

62
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,088
Calling into being like

63
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:34,880
Cool

64
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:36,160
Got anything else

65
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:42,560
So I today we're recording this primarily to

66
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:43,584
To get that announcement

67
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,608

Folkestone follow up

69
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:50,240
Acknowledge underscore fight on Twitter or just knowledge fight on Facebook

70
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:51,776
But also

71
00:02:52,032 --> 00:02:52,544
It's born

72
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:53,824
That we got to sit down

73
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,104
Don't have a little chat

74
00:02:56,128 --> 00:02:56,640
Cuz we're here

75
00:02:58,176 --> 00:03:00,224
I want to feel you in Jordan on what's been happening

76
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:02,272
For the last couple days on the show

77
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:07,648
A little bit of what's been happening

78
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:09,696
6

79
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:10,464
7

80
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,232
September

81
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:12,512
Of the year of Our Lord

82
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,328
The Wednesday and Thursday of this

83
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:18,400
Somebody

84
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:28,896
There's been a lot of bulshit he's been talking good about Putin

85
00:03:29,152 --> 00:03:34,528
Very weird as we know it would not be all that straight

86
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,576
Be here if we didn't have the contact

87
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:37,600
Learning

88
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:38,368
From 20

89
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,672
Oh yeah like that

90
00:03:40,928 --> 00:03:43,488
Things in a different light

91
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:44,512
Nothing positive about Putin

92
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:51,424
A lot at least proved Beyond Beyond

93
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,704
Filled out that he is

94
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,240
Looking for the Kremlin and some capacity

95
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:56,288
If you're not paying attention and just

96
00:03:56,544 --> 00:03:57,568
Listening to Infowars

97
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,688
Once in awhile and then

98
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:03,968
Alex starts yelling about some

99
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:05,504
Something else

100
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,296
Critical attention you realize

101
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:09,600
He talks about how great Putin is on almost

102
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:11,136
Every other episode

103
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:15,488
Everything has never said any

104
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:17,280
Anything negative about Russian even when

105
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:21,887
Biking

106
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:24,447
Is it in

107
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:25,471
Like

108
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:28,287
To say this

109
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:34,687
But the globalists are so bad is awesome which is another cowardly

110
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:36,479
Damn

111
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:41,087
Batman he looks

112
00:04:41,343 --> 00:04:42,623
Literal devil

113
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:44,159
Alright

114
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:48,511
But we don't need to get into it

115
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:51,071
It's not really all that great he basically

116
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:51,839
Play the clip

117
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:52,863
Putin in Russian

118
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:54,911
Translate

119
00:04:57,471 --> 00:05:01,055
Certainly doesn't work for the Russian government employee Daria

120
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:02,847
She translated it

121
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:03,615
From Russia

122
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:06,431
The

123
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:07,455
What's really funny

124
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:08,735
Is better

125
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:09,759
On the episode on the

126
00:05:10,783 --> 00:05:11,295
Alex

127
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:12,831
Complaining about North

128
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:13,599
Korea

129
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:15,135
Are you complaining about how the Clinton

130
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:17,439
Gave them their capabilities

131
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:19,743
Fervor

132
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:26,399
But what's really fun is

133
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:29,983
Actually look into the history of the

134
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:31,007
That North Korean

135
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:31,775
Weapons

136
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:34,079
You see that is all Russia in

137
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:37,151
PS3 they are the ones who've given the weather

138
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:39,199
To the comedy

139
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:40,479
What Alex Jones

140
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:42,015
Translating

141
00:05:42,527 --> 00:05:43,551
Clifford

142
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:44,575
Talking in Russian

143
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:46,879
He's clearly saying

144
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:50,719
We have given nuclear technology to other countries

145
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:52,255
Because

146
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:53,535
The clip is about how

147
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:57,631
Whoever becomes the leader in AI technology will rule the world

148
00:05:59,423 --> 00:06:00,959
And if

149
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:01,727
Country has it

150
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:02,751
They will be like

151
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:06,079
Totalitarianism

152
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:10,431
Robert Mercer

153
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:14,783
Yeah I might already but

154
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:15,551
Boutin's argue

155
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:17,599
Is that if we come up with

156
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:20,415
Sophisticated AI we will share it with everyone

157
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:25,279
Like we have our nuclear Galaxy like

158
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:26,303
I got to stop

159
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:27,583
Translator

160
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:35,519
Because

161
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:42,687
We f***** up Korean

162
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:51,903
If I were North Korea it's smarter to have nuclear

163
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:56,767
Did you see what happened

164
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:58,047
Who's bad

165
00:06:58,303 --> 00:06:59,327
Or I could

166
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:02,399
Newk's believe still be alright

167
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:07,007
Watching

168
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:13,151
What

169
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:15,199
Mustard gives me gas

170
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:16,223

Carvel Ice Cream tree that's the animatronic

177
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:46,431
Those are some of the things you talked about but

178
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:47,711
I want to play

179
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:50,015
Restart the show on the 6th

180
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:51,039
Because

181
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:52,063
I love

182
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:53,087
First of all

183
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:55,903
Talking about

184
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:57,695
Some other current events

185
00:07:57,951 --> 00:07:59,487
Better happening Isaac

186
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:00,767
Approach

187
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:01,791
Big on This Groove

188
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:08,703
Live from Austin Texas broadcasting World why it's Alex Jones

189
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:21,503
Because they noticed a lot of things going on so they couldn't explain yeah

190
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:35,327
Haven't described patterns where they weren't because that's what we do maybe

191
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:44,799
Modern history

192
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:57,599

This is also great

280
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:18,207
Feeling I've heard nothing about the debt limit

281

To go Trump is like I'm a globalist

That's a man that you got a ride to Tucker Carlson

295
00:14:01,983 --> 00:14:03,007

00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:32,575
It was about

395
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:34,111
How often time

396
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:36,159
Female named hurricane

397
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:37,183
A much more

398
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:37,951
Destructive

399
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:38,975
Because people don't

400
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:39,999
Take them as seriously

401
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:44,607
And Studies have been done that show

402
00:18:44,863 --> 00:18:47,679
That there is a dismissiveness people show towards

403
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:49,215
Female name thing

404
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:51,519
In particular

405
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:53,311
Alright well Humanity

406
00:18:56,127 --> 00:18:59,199
Katrina was more devastating

407
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:01,503
I mean that's just

408
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:04,063
One example and certainly not

409
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:06,111
Deuce

410
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:07,391
They want to talk about it

411
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:08,415
In terms of that study

412
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:10,207
It's not this is a sec

413
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:12,767
Hurricane or anything like that

414
00:19:13,023 --> 00:19:13,535
Because

415
00:19:14,047 --> 00:19:15,839
We know how hurricanes are named

416
00:19:16,095 --> 00:19:16,607
And it's just

417
00:19:16,863 --> 00:19:17,631
An alternate

418
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:22,751
Doesn't matter

419
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:25,567
Yeah

420
00:19:26,591 --> 00:19:27,359
More like

421
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:32,735
Person get the f*** out

422
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:34,783
The movie Carrie

423
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:38,111
The alphabet

424
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:40,159
Really alarming that there's three

425
00:19:40,415 --> 00:19:41,183
Letters in a row

426
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:42,975
Yeah

427
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:43,743
Pressing down

428
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:47,071
Yeah

429
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:50,655
Another narrative

430
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:51,935
But he's into

431
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:53,983
And it has to do with health

432
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:55,775
Probably

433
00:19:56,031 --> 00:19:56,543
He wants

434
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:58,079
He's going to sign on

435
00:19:58,591 --> 00:20:01,407
Singer

436
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:04,735
The other direction within everybody deserves

437
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:09,087
This is a health scare

438
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:12,415
Well the only Health Care is the

439
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:15,231
The fact that everybody doesn't have access to healthcare

440
00:20:18,815 --> 00:20:22,911
Something else altogether and it comes out

441
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:25,215
And two new antibiotic resistance

442
00:20:25,471 --> 00:20:29,311
Virulent superbug discovered in China

443
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:38,015
This morning

444
00:20:38,527 --> 00:20:39,551
Talking about it

445
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:43,135
You don't want to lose

446
00:20:52,095 --> 00:20:52,863
Pictures

447
00:20:58,239 --> 00:21:02,591
Silver

448
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:11,807
Night night

449
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:15,391
Water dollars a bottle

450
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:25,888
Double triple the price Amazon

451
00:21:26,144 --> 00:21:32,288
Dot-com prepared

452
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:35,616
You are such as for the storm

453
00:21:38,944 --> 00:21:39,456
Boy

454
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:47,904
Great sales pitch has everything

455
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:50,464
Terrified no one else is talking about

456
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:52,768
This is the scoop that only wheat

457
00:21:53,024 --> 00:21:54,560
Noticed you noticed

458
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:59,936
Because he realize the name Infowars is f***** out

459
00:22:00,192 --> 00:22:00,704
And everyone

460
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:03,264
No thank you

461
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:06,336
Very similar music

462
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:08,128
Infowars

463
00:22:08,384 --> 00:22:11,968
They still haven't

464
00:22:12,224 --> 00:22:12,736
Just in case

465
00:22:12,992 --> 00:22:14,528
So we wouldn't be able to smell

466
00:22:18,624 --> 00:22:22,976
Vaguely Familiar to something

467
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:26,560
Do yelling about global I can't see

468
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:37,312
Find history we've seen that evil companies when they Rebrand

469
00:22:37,568 --> 00:22:40,640
Black Blackwater

470
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:42,688
$6 problems

471
00:22:44,992 --> 00:22:46,016
They definitely don't just

472
00:22:46,528 --> 00:22:47,808
Put a new name on thing

473
00:22:48,064 --> 00:22:51,392
I mean he went from Prison Planet

474
00:22:53,184 --> 00:22:55,744
Little boy but

475
00:22:56,768 --> 00:22:58,304
And then he goes right

476
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:00,864
It's so good

477
00:23:01,376 --> 00:23:01,888
Silver

478
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,424
Sometimes work

479
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:06,240
All the antibiotics

480
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:08,544
Silver sometimes

481
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:15,968
It's going to say that you should buy colloidal silver

482
00:23:16,736 --> 00:23:20,064
I am also going to say the same thing

483
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,904
Maybe they'll help and everyone's gouging price

484
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:25,952
Storable food

485
00:23:26,208 --> 00:23:30,560
Of course we're keeping it on the sale it's always on 30% off

486
00:23:31,072 --> 00:23:36,960
Easter weekend hurricane Irma

487
00:23:37,728 --> 00:23:41,312
That's not good

488
00:23:41,824 --> 00:23:42,848
We're taking a bath

489
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,152
You going to pay your own shipping on a f******

490
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:46,432
Bucket of

491
00:23:47,456 --> 00:23:52,064
Go and look at the food

492
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:54,880
Yeah the storable foods are not like

493
00:23:55,136 --> 00:23:57,952
Do you like you're doing

494
00:23:59,232 --> 00:24:00,000
Money

495
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:03,072
And same

496
00:24:04,352 --> 00:24:06,400
The cartoon

497
00:24:07,168 --> 00:24:07,936
You also get a

498
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:08,960
You also get a car

499
00:24:09,216 --> 00:24:11,264
So you got the sense of it that Alex

500
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,056
His take on Hurricane Irma

501
00:24:13,312 --> 00:24:14,080
Is trying to score points

502
00:24:14,336 --> 00:24:15,616
Thanks for Trump

503
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:17,408
Blasting hypothetical things

504
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:18,432
If it left us too.

505
00:24:18,688 --> 00:24:19,456
Uses

506
00:24:19,968 --> 00:24:20,992
Gametime

507
00:24:21,504 --> 00:24:23,040
Profiting off of an axe

508
00:24:23,552 --> 00:24:24,064
Disaster that

509
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,088
He's not making

510
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:26,880
That's really more

511
00:24:29,696 --> 00:24:32,000
You get to visit from my friend Mike cernovich

512
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:35,584
He's high

513
00:24:41,472 --> 00:24:42,240
They spend

514
00:24:42,496 --> 00:24:44,032
Quite a while talking about how

515
00:24:44,288 --> 00:24:45,312
Life is a simulation

516
00:24:46,848 --> 00:24:47,872
Now that's

517
00:24:48,384 --> 00:24:49,152
Probably true

518
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:56,064
Typically speaking chances our life is a simulation really weird for them to be

519
00:24:56,576 --> 00:24:57,344
Infowars

520
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,392
With that like the background graphic

521
00:24:59,648 --> 00:25:02,720
Is just a Doppler radar of the hurricane

522
00:25:03,232 --> 00:25:04,768
What's on the screen behind

523
00:25:05,024 --> 00:25:06,304
Heather just like Taco Bell

524
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:07,328
Now maybe Zack

525
00:25:07,584 --> 00:25:09,376
Controllers who run the simulation

526
00:25:10,656 --> 00:25:11,168
Things up

527
00:25:11,424 --> 00:25:12,448
And that's why everything's

528
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:15,264
How long ago do you think scaramucci's

529
00:25:15,776 --> 00:25:19,104
That was like five years ago no it wasn't

530
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,408
Because everything's speeding up the stimulation is

531
00:25:22,432 --> 00:25:28,576
Like what the f*** is going on everybody deals with disaster in their own way

532
00:25:29,344 --> 00:25:31,904
Actually seems like a reasonable response

533
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:37,280
What is clearly a death cloud

534
00:25:37,792 --> 00:25:39,584
Isn't it

535
00:25:41,888 --> 00:25:44,704
Where is 100 miles away from

536
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:45,984
Pure Devastation in

537
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,288
The other part of our state

538
00:25:48,544 --> 00:25:49,568
Is underwater

539
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:56,224
Probably assume Malaysian that's a great way of dealing with all those numbers there's ones and zeros

540
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,272
It's not real

541
00:25:58,528 --> 00:26:00,320
Here is a clip

542
00:26:00,576 --> 00:26:01,856
I'm talkin that I think is

543
00:26:02,112 --> 00:26:02,880
The most sort of

544
00:26:04,928 --> 00:26:05,952
I believe

545
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:07,488
This struck me as

546
00:26:07,744 --> 00:26:08,768
Very weird

547
00:26:09,024 --> 00:26:09,792
Very weird

548
00:26:10,048 --> 00:26:11,328
But once these things

549
00:26:12,864 --> 00:26:19,008
Demi I can literally feed itself

550
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:30,784
That's why I tell people they should really watch Black Mirror

551
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:33,088
Been talking to them or if they have some kind of

552
00:26:33,344 --> 00:26:37,184
I'm transfer astral understands what's going on today

553
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,208
Did you

554
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:38,976
Alien

555
00:26:39,232 --> 00:26:40,256
Houston

556
00:26:40,512 --> 00:26:44,864
Cheerleaders in Black Mirror

557
00:26:47,424 --> 00:26:48,704
Nobody else could have those thoughts

558
00:26:49,216 --> 00:26:49,984
Nobody else

559
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:55,104
Didn't hide obvious

560
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:55,872
Might go

561
00:26:59,712 --> 00:27:00,480
Flavor taster

562
00:27:00,736 --> 00:27:04,576
Mike cernovich H

563
00:27:05,088 --> 00:27:06,880
Somehow in the simulation

564
00:27:07,648 --> 00:27:10,208
Which I'm there

565
00:27:10,464 --> 00:27:10,976
Dissimulation

566
00:27:11,232 --> 00:27:13,792
Create a

567
00:27:14,048 --> 00:27:15,072
The programs that everything

568
00:27:16,352 --> 00:27:16,864
Dissimulation

569
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:20,448
Wait so the simulation ends when we create AI

570
00:27:20,704 --> 00:27:21,216
I can fight back

571
00:27:21,984 --> 00:27:23,008
No no no no no no

572
00:27:24,032 --> 00:27:26,592
This is within the simulation

573
00:27:28,128 --> 00:27:28,640
Can jacket

574
00:27:28,896 --> 00:27:34,016
Like become self-replicating

575
00:27:39,392 --> 00:27:39,904
That's

576
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,256
And then we go to Thursday the 7th

577
00:27:44,768 --> 00:27:47,328
The first hour of the show is mostly Seth rich

578
00:27:47,584 --> 00:27:48,096
Kind of ship

579
00:27:48,352 --> 00:27:49,888
There's more

580
00:27:50,144 --> 00:27:52,448
People are not answer Pelosi bababababa

581
00:27:55,776 --> 00:27:57,568
It's going down

582
00:27:59,872 --> 00:28:04,992
If I can't

583
00:28:05,248 --> 00:28:07,296
I can't get it up for the narrative

584
00:28:07,552 --> 00:28:09,088
I just can't

585
00:28:09,344 --> 00:28:10,624
I listen to it

586
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,976
Months ago

587
00:28:15,488 --> 00:28:16,000
Right

588
00:28:16,768 --> 00:28:17,536
She's in play

589
00:28:17,792 --> 00:28:20,352
For so long

590
00:28:20,608 --> 00:28:21,120
The cover-up

591
00:28:21,376 --> 00:28:22,400
Of the Seth Rich murder

592
00:28:25,216 --> 00:28:25,728
Right

593
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,288
Alright

594
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:29,312
She knows

595
00:28:29,824 --> 00:28:30,848
Who's involved in the cover-up

596
00:28:33,664 --> 00:28:35,712
I can't jack to that narrative so we're not

597
00:28:35,968 --> 00:28:37,248
But I do in the first hour

598
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,112
Is substantially more important

599
00:28:42,624 --> 00:28:44,416
In the second hour Alex Jones

600
00:28:45,184 --> 00:28:47,232
By the name of Joanie Turner

601
00:28:48,256 --> 00:28:50,304
You don't know

602
00:28:50,816 --> 00:28:52,352
Joni Mitchell

603
00:28:52,608 --> 00:28:53,632

Is a lawyer

605
00:28:57,472 --> 00:28:58,752
Okay

606
00:28:59,008 --> 00:29:02,336
Equip up on the show

607
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:05,664

608
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:06,432
Say nothing

609
00:29:06,688 --> 00:29:07,200
I bet you

610
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:14,112
Not a good lawyer

611
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:36,128
Exactly

612
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:43,296
Publicizes probably lost in our list on their website is their own when they realize it for hours later they took it down

613
00:29:48,928 --> 00:29:50,208
As

614
00:29:50,464 --> 00:29:53,024
917

615
00:29:56,352 --> 00:29:57,632
Because she's an American

616
00:29:57,888 --> 00:30:00,192
She's a conservative

617
00:30:01,728 --> 00:30:03,264
White supremacist March

618
00:30:05,056 --> 00:30:08,128
Lawyer

619
00:30:08,384 --> 00:30:10,432

Legal advisor

622
00:30:29,376 --> 00:30:33,728
Corporate

623
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,032
As

624
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:49,344
Illogical and cultural terrorism

625
00:30:55,744 --> 00:30:58,304
Open-and-shut cases with two years of litigation

626
00:31:07,264 --> 00:31:08,288
In regards to the fact that

627
00:31:08,544 --> 00:31:10,336
The judge will open the case and then

628
00:31:10,848 --> 00:31:15,200
Get rid of the case very quickly

629
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:18,016
Brittany

She's suing CNN

633
00:31:29,024 --> 00:31:30,560
Because they used information

634
00:31:30,816 --> 00:31:31,840
I'm from the Southern Poverty Law

635
00:31:33,632 --> 00:31:36,448
Is a big bad guy in Alex Jones's

636
00:31:37,216 --> 00:31:40,032
Because they say bad things about him that are on

637
00:31:40,544 --> 00:31:41,312
Very true

638
00:31:41,824 --> 00:31:43,104
So

639
00:31:44,128 --> 00:31:44,640
It's

640
00:31:44,896 --> 00:31:45,408
Silly

641
00:31:46,176 --> 00:31:47,712
It's a frivolous lawsuit

642
00:31:47,968 --> 00:31:49,248
Thursday

643
00:31:54,624 --> 00:31:56,672
Interpersonal

644
00:31:57,184 --> 00:32:02,816
I think she wants to be the new Larry claim

645
00:32:03,328 --> 00:32:04,352
Oh okay

646
00:32:04,608 --> 00:32:06,912
She wants to be a celebrity lawyer

647
00:32:07,168 --> 00:32:07,936
Career change

648
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:09,216
Shifting

649
00:32:09,472 --> 00:32:11,776
Cuz her professional poker career isn't paying off

650
00:32:12,288 --> 00:32:16,384
Oh yeah

651
00:32:17,664 --> 00:32:18,432
She got Twitter

652
00:32:18,688 --> 00:32:23,296
Originally because she was going to Tweet her experience at the World Series of Poker

653
00:32:24,576 --> 00:32:26,880
I don't think she made the cash

654
00:32:28,416 --> 00:32:29,184
I don't know I can't

655
00:32:29,696 --> 00:32:30,464
For sure I don't watch that

656
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:32,512
Dark beer to my time

657
00:32:33,024 --> 00:32:33,536
Life when I

658
00:32:33,792 --> 00:32:37,376
Watch

659
00:32:37,632 --> 00:32:38,144
Professional poker

00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:41,216

661
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:44,288

00:34:18,752 --> 00:34:19,264
Baffling

699
00:34:20,032 --> 00:34:20,544

700
00:34:23,104 --> 00:34:23,616
Cheese jump

3 weeks ago

715
00:35:25,568 --> 00:35:26,592
To watch as

720
00:35:56,544 --> 00:35:59,616

Nope

730
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:27,168
A crime

And I can't even tell you how

732
00:37:37,408 --> 00:37:39,968
What are you doing

733
00:37:40,224 --> 00:37:41,504
To create a group

734
00:37:42,016 --> 00:37:43,552
They are funded

735
00:37:43,808 --> 00:37:48,160
Funded by the same people that the

Infowars and then you're correct late but I don't want to screw in

742
00:38:42,944 --> 00:38:44,736
The American people is a crime

743
00:38:46,016 --> 00:38:50,368
Lying about the American people is a crime

744
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:51,392
It is not

745
00:38:51,648 --> 00:38:52,672
Still not

746
00:38:53,184 --> 00:38:56,000
Lying about specific people is a crime that's why

747
00:38:57,024 --> 00:38:59,328
For slandered what you do it

748
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:02,912
These group of people they suck when they're awesome

749
00:39:03,936 --> 00:39:05,984
Also a lawyer

750
00:39:11,104 --> 00:39:12,128

Satirical.

Accent

763
00:39:55,904 --> 00:39:58,208
I don't want to put that on her whole cloth

764
00:39:58,464 --> 00:40:02,304
But I think she's doing it to herself

765
00:40:04,352 --> 00:40:04,864
Clematis

766
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:06,144

Clips that we've played into the public record in court

770
00:40:14,848 --> 00:40:18,432
For calling you a racist

771
00:40:18,688 --> 00:40:21,248

Is this lady

776
00:40:34,048 --> 00:40:35,072
Big complaint is that you

She saw Michael Morant

778
00:40:36,864 --> 00:40:38,144
Call Donald Trump a rapist

779
00:40:38,656 --> 00:40:40,448
Which his wife

00:40:41,984 --> 00:40:44,288
And then he himself has said

782

You've done things that I would

783
00:40:47,872 --> 00:40:48,640
But then

784
00:40:48,896 --> 00:40:49,408
The other thing

785
00:40:50,944 --> 00:40:52,480
Yeah

786
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:55,552
People $5,000

787
00:40:55,808 --> 00:40:59,136
To get on National Television yelling Bill Clinton is a rapist

788
00:40:59,392 --> 00:41:04,512
Alex Jones legitimately to go and disrupt rally

789
00:41:04,768 --> 00:41:06,560
And you make a shirt that you sold

790
00:41:06,816 --> 00:41:08,096
That was Bill Clinton is a rapist

791
00:41:09,376 --> 00:41:11,424
I don't see a problem there

792
00:41:13,472 --> 00:41:15,520
Like she said they get these people

793
00:41:15,776 --> 00:41:16,800
They pay him to go on

794
00:41:17,056 --> 00:41:18,848
TV and make these Wild

795
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:19,872
That's crazy

796
00:41:20,128 --> 00:41:25,504
Absolutely

797
00:41:26,528 --> 00:41:27,040
They're the ones

798
00:41:27,296 --> 00:41:30,880
Do cause that problem

799
00:41:31,904 --> 00:41:32,672
This is what it looks like

800
00:41:33,184 --> 00:41:35,488
This is B like this idea is

801
00:41:35,744 --> 00:41:37,024
What like the erosion of

802
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:37,792
Free speech

803
00:41:38,048 --> 00:41:38,560
In practice

804
00:41:38,816 --> 00:41:39,584
Looks like

805
00:41:41,376 --> 00:41:43,424
It's almost like we need a

806
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:44,704
National movement

807
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:45,984
Against fashion

808
00:41:46,496 --> 00:41:47,008
Emoji backpack

809
00:41:48,288 --> 00:41:50,080
But in this next clip

810
00:41:50,336 --> 00:41:51,104
Johnny wise

811
00:41:52,128 --> 00:41:53,919
It starts by talking about like donations

812
00:41:54,175 --> 00:41:55,455
From this other probably lost

813
00:41:59,295 --> 00:41:59,807
Or something

814
00:42:01,087 --> 00:42:01,855
And get a little more racist

815
00:42:02,111 --> 00:42:03,135
An interesting way

816
00:42:03,391 --> 00:42:04,415
JPMorgan

817
00:42:04,927 --> 00:42:07,487
The financial system

818
00:42:07,743 --> 00:42:10,047
You can't find it anywhere

819
00:42:14,655 --> 00:42:16,447
Is a million dollars a piece to it

820
00:42:16,703 --> 00:42:18,751
In the last month

821
00:42:28,223 --> 00:42:29,503
I can tell you that

822
00:42:41,023 --> 00:42:42,559
I think she's

823
00:42:48,703 --> 00:42:50,239
It's the connection

824
00:42:50,495 --> 00:42:52,799
People think that these are these are occurring

825
00:42:53,055 --> 00:42:59,199
It's the connection

826
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:07,647
We think you're going to fight back overly aggressive

827
00:43:07,903 --> 00:43:12,511
Yeah we think you're going to shoot people you like YouTube

828
00:43:16,607 --> 00:43:19,167
She brought up that she was look who he married

829
00:43:21,215 --> 00:43:21,727
Right

830
00:43:21,983 --> 00:43:24,543
No further comment on her

831
00:43:24,799 --> 00:43:28,639
So if no other qualities nothing

832
00:43:28,895 --> 00:43:29,407
Incorrectly

833
00:43:29,663 --> 00:43:31,199
Look who he married

834
00:43:31,711 --> 00:43:32,223
Not a good sign

835
00:43:32,479 --> 00:43:32,991
Welive

836
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:36,831
Non-white

837
00:43:39,135 --> 00:43:41,695
3 Thurlow

838
00:43:41,951 --> 00:43:44,255
If George Clooney wasn't so far to the left

839
00:43:44,511 --> 00:43:46,047
White lady

840
00:43:46,303 --> 00:43:47,839
Putting out babies left and right

841
00:43:49,375 --> 00:43:54,239
Until he was 50 or whatever

842
00:43:54,495 --> 00:44:00,639
Merge with powerful lawyer

843
00:44:01,663 --> 00:44:02,175
F******

844
00:44:04,991 --> 00:44:08,063
Abigail

845
00:44:09,855 --> 00:44:10,367
So much money

846
00:44:10,623 --> 00:44:12,927
Not as many of CNN

847
00:44:14,719 --> 00:44:17,023
Micaiah job

848
00:44:17,535 --> 00:44:19,839
CNN

849
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:22,655
But you're right

850
00:44:23,423 --> 00:44:24,959
She is equating a liberal

851
00:44:25,215 --> 00:44:28,287
Value or whatever with think is negative

852
00:44:28,799 --> 00:44:29,311
With

853
00:44:29,567 --> 00:44:31,615
A white person marrying a Lebanese

854
00:44:31,871 --> 00:44:34,687
He's person profoundly races

855
00:44:35,711 --> 00:44:36,735
I can't believe

856
00:44:37,247 --> 00:44:40,063
I can't believe that Alex let that slide on a show

857
00:44:42,111 --> 00:44:42,623
What the pho

858
00:44:42,879 --> 00:44:43,903
F*** is she saying

859
00:44:44,159 --> 00:44:47,231
The black lives matter what is that

860
00:44:47,487 --> 00:44:49,023
George Clooney look who he married

861
00:44:49,279 --> 00:44:52,351
I like

862
00:44:52,607 --> 00:44:56,447
What does Outlaw races happening on air

863
00:44:56,703 --> 00:44:59,775
Who in or even has the time Lebanese

864
00:45:00,031 --> 00:45:00,543
People lady

865
00:45:00,799 --> 00:45:01,311
You got

866
00:45:01,567 --> 00:45:03,615
So many people on your plate let him go

867
00:45:03,871 --> 00:45:08,223
Fun f****** real

868
00:45:08,479 --> 00:45:09,503
Is that where we get back

869
00:45:10,015 --> 00:45:10,783
Feelings about Trump

870
00:45:11,039 --> 00:45:12,319
She lands

871
00:45:13,855 --> 00:45:15,135
Spectrum

872
00:45:15,903 --> 00:45:16,415
Supportive rain

873
00:45:21,791 --> 00:45:25,887
We're not in 2015

874
00:45:26,143 --> 00:45:27,679
The water has broken

875
00:45:28,191 --> 00:45:34,335
Here you go

876
00:45:35,871 --> 00:45:38,431
Bushes

877
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:50,207
4 years

878
00:45:57,119 --> 00:45:59,935
Alex

879
00:46:12,479 --> 00:46:18,623
Mercer

880
00:46:26,303 --> 00:46:27,583
Divine intervention

881
00:46:27,839 --> 00:46:32,959
Blocked

882
00:46:33,215 --> 00:46:36,287
And showing everyone

883
00:46:36,799 --> 00:46:40,639
Yeah he's giving people the opportunity to see

884
00:46:40,895 --> 00:46:44,735
When did he ever ride

885
00:46:44,991 --> 00:46:46,015
Where are

886
00:46:46,271 --> 00:46:49,855
The media so much

887
00:46:50,111 --> 00:46:52,415
No and that's a big problem

888
00:46:52,671 --> 00:46:54,463
Yeah I really don't like that

889
00:46:55,231 --> 00:46:57,023
If you are going to have reports about Aunt

890
00:46:57,279 --> 00:46:57,791
Antifa

891
00:46:58,047 --> 00:46:58,559
Yeah they should be

892
00:46:59,071 --> 00:47:05,215
But it is like every

893
00:47:07,263 --> 00:47:08,799
They're not there

894
00:47:09,823 --> 00:47:11,871
Real fight against

895
00:47:18,783 --> 00:47:19,551
People will turn the T

896
00:47:19,807 --> 00:47:22,623
Exactly

897
00:47:27,487 --> 00:47:30,559
Play the election ended up

898
00:47:32,095 --> 00:47:34,911
Unfortunately

899
00:47:35,167 --> 00:47:36,959
Point both sides have problems

900
00:47:37,215 --> 00:47:37,983
Yeah but one of the sides

901
00:47:38,239 --> 00:47:39,775
Does not cease until Nazi

902
00:47:40,031 --> 00:47:41,055
These aren't one of the sides

903
00:47:41,311 --> 00:47:42,335
All bets are off

904
00:47:42,591 --> 00:47:43,359
Totally

905
00:47:43,615 --> 00:47:44,383
People are awesome

906
00:47:44,639 --> 00:47:46,431
I was on MSN

907
00:47:46,687 --> 00:47:47,967
ABC by report would be like

908
00:47:48,223 --> 00:47:49,759
Hey look at these guys punching Nazis

909
00:47:50,015 --> 00:47:51,295
Why don't the Red Sea

910
00:47:59,231 --> 00:48:00,511
Escalate

911
00:48:03,327 --> 00:48:06,399
Deeply upset by and I think we should all be troubled by

912
00:48:06,911 --> 00:48:07,423
Is there

913
00:48:09,215 --> 00:48:09,727
Did Trump

914
00:48:09,983 --> 00:48:11,263
What's brought on by God

915
00:48:13,311 --> 00:48:15,103
Predestined in all this was a god

916
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:15,871
Plan

917
00:48:16,127 --> 00:48:16,895
Alex is like

918
00:48:17,407 --> 00:48:18,175
Hell yeah it was

919
00:48:18,687 --> 00:48:19,711
I meant Mike cernovich

920
00:48:19,967 --> 00:48:21,247
Because he had to walk back

921
00:48:21,759 --> 00:48:22,271
From support

922
00:48:22,527 --> 00:48:23,807
About a month-and-a-half ago cuz

923
00:48:24,063 --> 00:48:24,831
Cuz it was bad for business

924
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:26,623
I have to like

925
00:48:29,951 --> 00:48:30,975
DSM milquetoast

926
00:48:33,535 --> 00:48:34,559
To get in there.

927
00:48:34,815 --> 00:48:35,839
But he has to be like

928
00:48:36,095 --> 00:48:38,399
He's letting them show how bad the last really is

929
00:48:38,655 --> 00:48:42,495
Right. Cuz that's about as deep as his balls go now

930
00:48:42,751 --> 00:48:44,799
I would love it if the religious

931
00:48:45,055 --> 00:48:45,567
Right

932
00:48:45,823 --> 00:48:46,591
That

933
00:48:46,847 --> 00:48:49,151
Natural disasters

934
00:48:49,407 --> 00:48:49,919
Cuz we allowed

935
00:48:50,943 --> 00:48:51,455
Get married

936
00:48:51,967 --> 00:48:52,735
Beat that one can

937
00:48:53,247 --> 00:48:54,527
Well we elect

938
00:48:54,783 --> 00:48:55,551
Trumpet now we have

939
00:48:55,807 --> 00:48:56,319
Three hurricane

940
00:48:56,575 --> 00:48:57,599
Murdering everybody in

941
00:48:57,855 --> 00:48:58,623
Destroying the world

942
00:48:59,903 --> 00:49:02,207
Well maybe one of them will destroy Mar-A-Lago

943
00:49:03,231 --> 00:49:03,743
We can only hope

944
00:49:03,999 --> 00:49:05,279
Still won't be worth it for the

945
00:49:05,791 --> 00:49:06,303
Terrible

946
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:08,863
Destruction that it's already brought

947
00:49:09,375 --> 00:49:10,399
To those Island

948
00:49:11,167 --> 00:49:12,959
Now that's that's so f***** up

949
00:49:15,263 --> 00:49:16,799
We got to get out of here so you can get to your show

950
00:49:17,055 --> 00:49:18,079
But I would like

951
00:49:18,335 --> 00:49:20,383
It's pretty impressive that Alex Jones

952
00:49:21,663 --> 00:49:22,943
Mushoku suing

953
00:49:23,455 --> 00:49:26,527
Class action lawsuit with 25,000 people behind her

954
00:49:27,039 --> 00:49:27,807
I'm sure some of them

955
00:49:29,087 --> 00:49:30,367
A couple box thrown in there

956
00:49:31,647 --> 00:49:33,439
Be that as it may

957
00:49:33,695 --> 00:49:34,719
I hope

958
00:49:35,487 --> 00:49:36,767
With this racist f***

959
00:49:37,023 --> 00:49:41,631
A lawyer who doesn't know that it's not illegal to lie

960
00:49:41,887 --> 00:49:43,935
But she was more publicly races

961
00:49:44,191 --> 00:49:46,239
Justin David Duke on his episode

962
00:49:48,031 --> 00:49:49,055
Out-and-out like

963
00:49:50,847 --> 00:49:51,615
What cuz she's dumb

964
00:49:51,871 --> 00:49:54,175
Delete stuff

No I'm racist but

967
00:50:01,855 --> 00:50:05,439
Let's infiltrate

968
00:50:06,207 --> 00:50:06,975
Then we'll attack

969
00:50:07,231 --> 00:50:08,255
Don't just go out

970
00:50:08,767 --> 00:50:09,791
Epcot we've only got

971
00:50:10,047 --> 00:50:10,815
Most of lawn

All of lawn for

973
00:50:16,703 --> 00:50:17,471
Then we can come out

974
00:50:21,567 --> 00:50:22,591
Anyway

975
00:50:23,103 --> 00:50:23,871

00:50:27,967 --> 00:50:28,735
And what we do

978
00:50:28,991 --> 00:50:33,599
What that website

979
00:50:33,855 --> 00:50:35,647
JanSport the show

980
00:50:36,159 --> 00:50:40,767
It would be great

981
00:50:41,023 --> 00:50:41,791
Because we're about to kick

982
00:50:42,047 --> 00:50:43,839
Kicks it into overdrive

983
00:50:44,351 --> 00:50:46,399
We are going to need some support

984
00:50:47,167 --> 00:50:53,311
BECU office

985
00:50:59,967 --> 00:51:06,111
That was mighty white of you

986
00:51:13,535 --> 00:51:14,303
Warriors

987
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:17,119
Appreciate it

988
00:51:17,375 --> 00:51:18,655
There's going to be a lot of stuff coming

989
00:51:19,167 --> 00:51:20,703
It's very exciting what's that broadcast

990
00:51:22,495 --> 00:51:24,543
Possibly even going to a daily format

991
00:51:24,799 --> 00:51:26,335
Verizon

992
00:51:26,591 --> 00:51:27,871
And we

993
00:51:31,199 --> 00:51:37,343
I once again apologies for not being able to do the live show we won't be able to do that

994
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:42,719
You don't need to apologize for your career going well

995
00:51:42,975 --> 00:51:44,255
So

996
00:51:45,023 --> 00:51:48,095
You don't you don't need like I know that you feel bad about it but you don't need to Apollo

997
00:51:51,167 --> 00:51:52,959
They're good people out there these policy walk

998
00:51:55,007 --> 00:51:57,055
I'm just disappointed

999
00:51:57,567 --> 00:52:03,455
I want to say will do it also if you want

1000
00:52:03,711 --> 00:52:04,223
Underscore

1001
00:52:04,735 --> 00:52:09,087
We are on

1002
00:52:09,343 --> 00:52:10,367
Read the reviews

1003
00:52:13,183 --> 00:52:17,279
Get an idea of how you want to write your review

1004
00:52:17,535 --> 00:52:22,911
Some research before you just look for announcements

1005
00:52:23,167 --> 00:52:25,215
Send me a very near future

1006
00:52:26,495 --> 00:52:27,519
But

1007
00:52:28,543 --> 00:52:30,591
There's one thing I forgot to cover in the episodes were talking about

1008
00:52:32,895 --> 00:52:34,175
Saint Thursday

1009
00:52:40,831 --> 00:52:41,343
Pretty toothless

1010
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:42,879
E2m anyways

1011
00:52:43,135 --> 00:52:44,927
Also he has a picture

1012
00:52:45,183 --> 00:52:45,695
In the background

1013
00:52:47,743 --> 00:52:50,047
It's not

1014
00:52:51,327 --> 00:52:52,351
He hasn't hung it up

1015
00:52:54,399 --> 00:52:55,167
He what

1016
00:52:55,423 --> 00:52:56,191
Negative

1017
00:52:56,447 --> 00:52:58,495
What recently

1018
00:52:58,751 --> 00:53:00,287
Set me a blown up

1019
00:53:00,543 --> 00:53:01,823
Picture of the picture

1020
00:53:02,847 --> 00:53:04,895
It's tough to tell what it is

1021
00:53:05,407 --> 00:53:07,967
But I think it's a crude painting of a clown

1022
00:53:15,391 --> 00:53:18,975
Of course for the picture of a f****** clown I'm not sure

1023
00:53:22,303 --> 00:53:27,679
F****** Poltergeist s*** like what is it I don't know it's very weird

1024
00:53:27,935 --> 00:53:28,959
I'd rather

1025
00:53:29,983 --> 00:53:30,495
Behind us

1026
00:53:30,751 --> 00:53:33,823
Then this m************ because I would never say f*** you honey

1027
00:53:34,335 --> 00:53:39,199
Controlling

1028
00:53:41,247 --> 00:53:44,319
