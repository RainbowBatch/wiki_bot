Knowledge party.com

2
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:27,136
I have great respect for this knowledge B

00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:39,936
MoneyGram

4
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:56,320
Knowledge fight

00:00:56,576 --> 00:01:02,464
Dot-com

6
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:09,632
Action for you

7
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:13,728
My brakes but today is actually it's been a little bit of

8
00:01:13,984 --> 00:01:14,752
Challenging week

9
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:16,800
But if he gets around to my bright spot

10
00:01:17,312 --> 00:01:21,152
And that is the beginning of this weekend I don't know I don't know if I'm

11
00:01:21,408 --> 00:01:24,224
Getting sort of like Stolen Valor by calling it surgery

12
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:30,624
I'm not sure I call it surgery cuz it was cutting something out.

13
00:01:31,904 --> 00:01:38,048
Because it's just cuz it's not like open heart surgery doesn't mean you don't get to call it surgery feels like I'm putting on a

14
00:01:38,304 --> 00:01:42,912
Presumptuous

15
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:46,240
I know that's true I have dealt with

16
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:49,056
A ingrown toenail on my right

17
00:01:49,312 --> 00:01:53,152
Big toe for the past 15 years

18
00:01:53,408 --> 00:01:54,944
Long long time

19
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,552
I've had it cut out a couple times and it comes

20
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:02,112
Because lingering chronic problem

21
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:04,672
I've gotten to the point where I

22
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:08,512
Kind of made a decision in my head like while it's just never going

23
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:13,376
This is something that I have and it's for the rest of my life

24
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:15,424
Flight Club

25
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:22,080
Recently I started to come around on the idea of like that's a silly

26
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:25,408
Jamaican I started to think about all of the ways in which

27
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,456
It is impacting my life

28
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:31,296
Staff are there so many things that I want to do or I want to be able to

29
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:33,856
To do that I can't do because of this

30
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:35,648
Right like I can't climb a tree

31
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:40,512
Because of I do I'll probably bang my my toe on it and it'll hurt like hell

32
00:02:40,768 --> 00:02:41,792
Can't do push-ups

33
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:46,144
The normal way because of the excruciating pain of trying to put on my weight

34
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,192
On the on my foot I can't run

35
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:49,472
Because of the constant

36
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:51,776
Hiding on the ground of the foot

37
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:55,104
I'm sorry I finally decided to bite the bullet

38
00:02:56,128 --> 00:02:56,640
Take care of it

39
00:02:56,896 --> 00:02:57,664
Now have

40
00:02:58,176 --> 00:02:59,712
A wounded foot

41
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:02,272
Very nicely and

42
00:03:02,784 --> 00:03:04,832
Yeah it was it was an interesting experience

43
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:05,600
It's to go in at

44
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:07,392
And I have that.

45
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:09,696
Things cut

46
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:10,976
Circle

47
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:16,864
I believe anything in the open wound and I like sometimes I leave for steps in something like that nothing

48
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,448
I don't think the wound is big enough to put 46 then but

49
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:23,008
No I think I don't think was any souvenirs

50
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:24,032
Synagogue

51
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:28,384
Oh man I can see now we're going to get into conspiracy theories

52
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:32,480
This was absolutely a patriot Dr and you have been implanted with a

53
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:34,784
Fine they know where you are

54
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:38,624
My apartment

55
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:39,904
Cool

56
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:45,024
Couldn't you call me

57
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:51,680
They told the beginning of this week I couldn't run

58
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:55,264
End until at least two weeks from now you feel well

59
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,312
Yeah my toe

60
00:03:57,568 --> 00:04:00,384
Looks like it says right now not going to be running for a bit

61
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:06,784
It's a bright spot to come to a point where I can't take care of this guy

62
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,576
To move in a positive direction

63
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:14,976
Well obviously for years

64
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:17,024
Constantly

65
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:23,423
It's not like a regular topic

66
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:25,727
I just read up

67
00:04:25,983 --> 00:04:26,751
Stuff you want

68
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:29,311
That's awesome

69
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:32,127
What are the best part about it is that like going to like

70
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:33,663
ICare afterwards a lot of it

71
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:40,063
It involves just Epsom salt baths

72
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:44,671
Matt Smith

73
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:51,071
Series of Doctor Who

74
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:55,679
You know whenever I first saw him I think it was like 2010 was almost

75
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:56,959
12 years ago or something

76
00:04:57,471 --> 00:04:59,775
And it was immediately like

77
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:00,799
Oh

78
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:02,591
This would be like if I was a duck

79
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:04,895
That was it was just like this makes

80
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:07,455
Good sense to me and I'm rewatching it and it's still

81
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:11,807
Is allowed he's loud he is simultaneously

82
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:18,207
Incredibly fast-talkin very angry and also sad all the time

83
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:18,975
Interesting

84
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:21,791
Sounds like I don't need to watch this show live experience

85
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:27,423
Today's episode of a little bit of a Survivor thought

86
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:29,983
Is the new segment Survivor thoughts

87
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:32,031
I started season 10

88
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:36,127
I think it's harder to watch now

89
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:38,943
Because in season 9

90
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:39,711
Probst

91
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:46,111
Starts dating one of the contestants after the season's over

92
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:50,463
Still not cool with that little bit uncomfortable to watch

93
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:56,863
That's not okay

94
00:05:57,119 --> 00:06:03,263
I'm sure that they had a fine relationship is based on like

95
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:07,615
Makes me a little uncomfortable

96
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:12,991
And then what was the other thought that I had season 9 is almost certainly where the first

97
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:19,391
Vale of the show being destroyed happen because something happens in the second episode

98
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:20,415
Square

99
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:21,439
They

100
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:22,463
Hypnotic

101
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:23,231
Explain

102
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:26,559
How this is supposed to go

103
00:06:27,071 --> 00:06:31,935
There's a man in the women's tribe

104
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:32,959
Reward

105
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:33,983
And immunity

106
00:06:34,239 --> 00:06:34,751
Okay

107
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:39,103
The first challenge as a tribe get a reward

108
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:41,919
I meant individually to get immunity

109
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:44,991
One-man or one-woman will win immunity

110
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:47,039
Then

111
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:50,367
Both tribes have to go to Tribal Council and vote somebody out

112
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:51,135
Bright

113
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:53,183
The person who wins immunity

114
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:54,207
Individual

115
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:54,975
It's safe

116
00:06:56,511 --> 00:07:01,631
They go to the other Tribal Council and give you immunity to one of the opposite ripe

117
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:03,167
It's like

118
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:09,823
While the people were trying to explain what was going on is it like no no no no no no no you're trying too hard

119
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:11,359
This is it there's no

120
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:14,175
Nobody was like hey you know what the problem with Survivor was

121
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:20,831
Not enough Rube Goldberg machines sincerely like the people on the show trying to explain what was happening Steve

122
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:23,647
And I was like oh no

123
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:33,631
Not many people tuned into TV to watch 9th grade story problems from geometry talk

124
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:34,399
Talk to them

125
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:41,055
Yeah there's a lot of logic puzzles that go on in terms of the rules

126
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:42,079
40 miles an hour

127
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:46,943
Headed east and another one of your teammates

128
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:51,039
Infuriated

129
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:56,415
Quickly it deteriorates that seems to me to be like that

130
00:07:56,927 --> 00:07:57,951
Just that backpack

131
00:07:58,207 --> 00:08:01,279
Cracked

132
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:04,863
Spread we've run out of ideas windshield is going to break

133
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:10,239
Also last survivor thought I loved the deranged that they haven't earned their challenges

134
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:12,543
Elaborate

135
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:20,991
The job over there to climb this wall then carry it back over the wall

136
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:25,087
Heaven sometimes like f****** hold your breath

137
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:30,975
Bedside yeah that's such a favorite joke

138
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:33,023
All of Rick and Morty is

139
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:36,351
Rick sets up this like sausage we have to get

140
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:37,119
Through challenges

141
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:38,655
And then because he was

142
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:42,239
Two drunken of the third one of these just like I ran out of ideas

143
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:43,007
Three-pointers

144
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:49,151
Exactly what I was looking for

145
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:55,551
It does feel like that

146
00:08:57,087 --> 00:09:00,927
Jordan today we're going to be going over July 13th 2020

147
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:06,815
That was a straight-up tide that was simultaneous episodes

148
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:12,959
Troubling in a number of ways and some of the stuff I'm excited and

149
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:13,727
Uncomfort

150
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:16,031
Get to that moment

151
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:18,847
Let's say hello to some new

152
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:22,687
The first bag creator of butt poop thank you so much you are now policy walk

153
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:25,759
That might be a code of some sort

154
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:28,063
Whatever whatever that is I'm sure it's

155
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:32,159
Neuromancer was a good book but all tomorrow's parties is William Gibson

156
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:33,951
All capitals basketball

157
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:34,975
Fight me

158
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:36,255
You're now policy walk

159
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:42,911
Opposition

160
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:45,215
I'm a policy wonk

161
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:47,007
Next

162
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:52,127
Yolanda pronounce Yolanda and not Yolanda thank you so much you are now policy walk

163
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:58,783
Orlando

164
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:06,207
Hello

165
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:07,999
You're not

166
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:12,095
I'm a policy wonk

167
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:19,519
We got to go

168
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:20,543
What's the business

169
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:22,591
Heroin

170
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:26,431
Large

171
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:37,183
Certainly we haven't we have a little bit of we got to get deep

172
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:40,255
But we have to get deeper than usual

173
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:43,839
Giving someone life is giving someone death

174
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:47,167
You can say that

175
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:52,799
You could say that

176
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:56,639
And I I I hate to say this and it pains me but

177
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:58,431
I think this is probably our last

178
00:10:58,687 --> 00:10:59,711
Birthday sextant

179
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:06,623
I apologize to anybody who is that made a birthday shout-out request that has not been you not heard it on

180
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:07,647
On the show

181
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:14,559
We can't risk getting out of control. We had fun and I want this to be something that

182
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:16,607
We could all have a good time with and I think we did

183
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:18,911
I think

184
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:19,679
Between us

185
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:22,239
And we we ran this into the ground

186
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:23,775
You know you could say

187
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:25,311
Vet starting a segment

188
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:27,615
Is ending a second

189
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:33,503
That is what we have come to

190
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:38,111
In this farewell edition of birthday shout-outs I'd like to give

191
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:38,879
Shout out

00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:40,671

So Stephanie sent me a message

196
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:51,679
Happy birthday shout-out to

197
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:52,447
My brother

198
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:54,495
So I know the birthday

00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:57,823
Of July

00:11:58,335 --> 00:12:01,407
I know that he's 31 years old his name

202
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:03,711
See once again

203
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:05,503

00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:06,527

You got wish to happy birthday and if your Stephanie's brother stay with you

206
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:15,743
He was the one who emailed brother

207
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:22,143
If you're Stephanie's brother you never specified if you're somebody out there and you have a sister named Stephanie and your birthday

208
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:25,215
On the 14th and you're 31 years old happy birthday birthday

209
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:25,983
Happy birthday

210
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:31,615
Now unfortunately and this is true this is our last birthday segment

211
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:34,687
These are will also be the last birthdays for all people involved

212
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:36,991
I'm sorry to say that but I was how it works

213
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:38,783
I don't stay by that but

214
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:39,551
Whatever

215
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:45,951
We're going to do this year July 13th

216
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:48,255
The good old days

217
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:54,655
Whorehouse

218
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:57,215
ZZ Top

219
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:02,079
Indiana Jones

220
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:07,711
Parenthood

221
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:09,247
How how how

222
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:13,599
ZZ Top lyrics

223
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:18,975
Hey I love I love all Aerosmith songs when all the sudden he's just like

224
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:21,279
Aerosmith

225
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:25,119
Yeah I had to buddy who did we did do the lot of karaoke

226
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:26,655
Get together and he would do like

227
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:32,799
Play ZZ Top and you can just sing she's got legs she knows how to use them tires up

228
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:34,591
Is the m of fence

229
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:36,639
The entire time

230
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:40,479
Nobody ever claimed ZZ Top with

231
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:44,319
Position

232
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:52,255
Composition on the Planet of Women

233
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:56,351
Or slip inside my sleeping bag

234
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:58,399
I will never not be delighted whenever I

235
00:13:58,655 --> 00:14:00,703
I'm finally get back to reading ZZ Top

236
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:02,239
Song titles are pretty good

237
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:03,519
Did you guys get

238
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:04,543
Owl.

239
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:07,871
How are we going to start off here's where Alex

240
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:09,919
About 5 years ago

241
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:12,735
Gmail already Boston ford.com

242
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:13,503
URL

243
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:19,135
Library

244
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:22,463
Define one that resists them

245
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:27,071
This really is the Holy Grail of control

246
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:29,631
This is a rare opportunity where you can actually do it

247
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:33,471
Experiment to test the truth of the claim that Alex is making and it is not true

248
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:35,519
I have multiple Gmail accounts

249
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:39,871
For personal and professional use tonight I tested sending various Infowars length between them

250
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:41,919
Not got censored at numberblocks

251
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:42,687
Even links

252
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:48,319
Student homepage not even hiding behind some dummy you redirect URL just went and went there just fine

253
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:51,391
Visitors more agreement bragging that I was just trying to do

254
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:55,487
That's so funny cuz I saw the I saw one of the test email

255
00:14:55,999 --> 00:15:00,351
Onr I looked at it and I was like

256
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:02,655
And then two seconds later I was like

257
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:05,471
Oh Alex must have claimed that you couldn't email his leg

258
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:09,055
I immediately knew exactly Heather

259
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:14,943
Before we get too deep into this episode I want to mention that there was a really severe tone

260
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:15,967
That you'll notice

261
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:17,247
Throughout the show and

262
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:21,599
I don't see them before I started listen to this episode over on banned. Video

263
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:22,879
Heather's preparing things

264
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:26,975
The featured video on the homepage was a gris-gris video titled quote

265
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:28,767
This Is the End

266
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:30,815
Oh that's a horseshoe start

267
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:34,399
The episode of recovering today from July 13th has the headline quote

268
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:38,495
The globalist must be arrested now or billions will die

269
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:44,895
As I was looking over the video titles on the site I couldn't help but feel like this was just kind of end of the world theme

270
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:50,271
One video was just titled quote New World orders official announcement by government shocks

271
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:51,039
The planet

272
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:54,111
Think about how many times Alex's run that headline in the past

273
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:58,207
How many times has reported that finally the New World Order is come out into the open

274
00:15:58,719 --> 00:15:59,487
Almost a joke at the

275
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:03,839
The thing that really stuck out to me was how low Alex's view count though

276
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:05,375
We're on these videos

277
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:11,519
You think of this we were telling of doing would be the kind of thinking employee to gain attention to drive traffic and if that's the plan

278
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:13,567
I'm not convinced that that plan is working

279
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:16,127
August actual episodes of you count

280
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:19,711
Between two and three hundred thousand views which isn't bad

281
00:16:21,503 --> 00:16:22,783
Way below what you'd expect

282
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:23,551
For someone like

283
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:24,831
In Alex's position

284
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:29,439
It looks like Alex is Saturday shows which have a guest heavy format

285
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:32,255
Who seem to be far more popular than his usual show

286
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:34,047
And I can't help but think of it

287
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:36,351
That's at least partially because his normal show sucks

288
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:37,631
But even the audience

289
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:40,959
Maybe getting tired of this are getting really ready to be like

290
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:43,007
You can't carry the show by yourself

291
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:46,847
All the king's horses men and Sensational headlines Camp makeup

292
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:48,895
Or how tired this act is getting

293
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:51,455
I want you have these Saturday shows that are like

294
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:52,223
For guests

295
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:52,991
Deep

296
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:54,783
Alright let's see what

297
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:58,367
Nick Fuentes is going to bring to the Mayo Clinic in your barn

298
00:16:59,135 --> 00:17:02,207
Yeah like you do that and if I go out at least that'll be different than Alex

299
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:05,279
Rambling on about bulshit yeah

300
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:08,351
If I were him a Alex I'd be a bit worried

301
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:09,375
About this

302
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:10,143
Phenomenon

303
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:13,983
Like you still pulling way better numbers than Owen Shroyer and Harrison Smith butt

304
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:19,871
I was looking around and he's pretty consistently getting beat by Greg Reese's Sensational last

305
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:22,175
Little video essay

306
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:26,271
To be the leader in the clubhouse

307
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:27,807
You know what he's got to do

308
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:30,879
Get a Coho

309
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:31,903
First show

310
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:33,951
But don't go in The Patriot

311
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:35,231
Sport

312
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:35,999
Talk radio

313
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:37,535
All those guys are crazy

314
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:43,935
Conservative insane and they are they all know how to talk non-stop without actually saying anything

315
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:47,263
I think Owen Shroyer has some history in

316
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:53,663
In sports journalism perhaps I think back in Missouri he might have been involved

317
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:58,783
Attache please switch to just being an old Texas Rangers

318
00:17:59,039 --> 00:17:59,551
Talk format

319
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:01,087
Why not

320
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:01,855
Couldn't

321
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:07,743
Here's where Alex has to go from he's already made the claim that the Gmail blocks everything

322
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:09,023
Show nonsense

323
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:11,327
Amazon to be like

324
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:15,167
Text Sarah block your email

325
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:20,287
I'm glad that

326
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:22,847
Sake talking to Preston

327
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:24,383
We're getting ready to start

328
00:18:25,151 --> 00:18:26,175
The DMC is

329
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:30,015
National Police 47 Oz that's actually who

330
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:31,295
And the Pentagon

331
00:18:32,575 --> 00:18:35,135
I would

332
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:37,951
To read all of your text messages

333
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:40,511
Have them stand by AI flag

334
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:43,327
Block your ability to say certain things

335
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:47,423
Going to go into the autofill function and not let you

336
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:48,959
Certain

337
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:50,239
Even before

338
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:52,799
It's been scanned

339
00:18:53,055 --> 00:18:53,823
When you try to send it

340
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:54,591
What

341
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:57,663
This is the power of AI Control

342
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:03,039
So first of all up to this point Alex has not specified what article his employee showed him that

343
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:04,063
Spelled all this out

344
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:07,903
He's made reference to how important it is a couple of times but I have no specific

345
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:10,463
Fix to work on other than I think it was in Politico

346
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:16,607
Now what's really break down the claim that Alex is making here because I think if you look at the constituent parts of this conspiracy

347
00:19:16,863 --> 00:19:18,655
You'll see how desperately he's just grabbing it

348
00:19:18,911 --> 00:19:20,191
Straws trying to make stuff up

349
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:26,847
So press secretary Jen sake said in a press conference that the dmc's new police force

350
00:19:27,103 --> 00:19:28,895
Is teamed up with a pentagon and their enlisted

351
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:31,711
Trainees from the abl in the Southern Poverty Law Center

352
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:33,759
History literally everyone

353
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:36,575
This will be achieved by

354
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:39,903
Through an unspecified

355
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:42,207
Then I guess stop them from being delivered

356
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:44,767
Wow human review takes place like us

357
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:51,423
This is also going to somehow affect the autofill function of every different phone companies operating system which is going to make it so

358
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:52,447
So you can't type certain

359
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:56,287
Now autofill apparently will no longer just suggest words

360
00:19:56,543 --> 00:19:57,311
That you might be typing

361
00:19:57,823 --> 00:19:59,615
School force you to take their suggestions

362
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:02,943
It seems like a user experience nightmare waiting to happen

363
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:04,479
I think

364
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:06,271
1 people might notice

365
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:09,855
2

366
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:13,439
Before we go any further with what they can do

367
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:17,279
If there's a DNC police force teaming up with a pentagon already a prop

368
00:20:17,535 --> 00:20:20,607
I don't need further conspiracies

369
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:22,655
This is stupid

370
00:20:22,911 --> 00:20:27,263
Even if you were an evil all-powerful cabal bedtime

371
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:30,079
This would be a dumb dumb way to do it

372
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:34,175
For one reason the autofill thing would cause an uproar in the consumer base

373
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:40,831
We've seen over and over again that in the realm of digital communication if certain words are banned people will try to find ways to use

374
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:42,367
Go to replace letters and symbol

375
00:20:42,623 --> 00:20:43,391
Getaround scanning

376
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:47,743
If a company were to impose word restrictions to the b word affect the customers

377
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:49,279
Ability to use the product

378
00:20:49,535 --> 00:20:50,303
People would adapt

379
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:51,839
Communication or stop using

380
00:20:52,095 --> 00:20:52,607
The product

381
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:55,423
What's going on here is that Alex's just evolved disc

382
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:58,239
Conspiracy about that bill we talked about in the last episode

383
00:20:58,495 --> 00:21:00,287
That anti-racism in public health Act

384
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:02,591
The 2021 the tablet isn't going to pass

385
00:21:04,127 --> 00:21:10,271
Not just about the adln splc reading your medical records now they scan all your text messages

386
00:21:10,527 --> 00:21:11,295
All thanks to this

387
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:13,599
Politico article I think

388
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:16,416
Yeah I think what's funny about that is

389
00:21:16,928 --> 00:21:17,696
More

390
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:19,744
More than anything else

391
00:21:20,256 --> 00:21:21,536
More than any of Trumps

392
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:24,352
Sly's or the conservative propaganda

393
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:30,240
A massive amount of consumer inconvenience would lead to an overthrow of our

394
00:21:30,496 --> 00:21:31,264
More than

395
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:35,616
More than like all they stole the election everybody's like politics is corrupt

396
00:21:35,872 --> 00:21:39,712
But if you're like I can't text my friends anymore

397
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,272
I mean you took down my spaces yeah

398
00:21:42,784 --> 00:21:48,160
Who's huge MySpace created that you cook people forget that deaf course they do

399
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:53,792
Course they do we never would have had to orgasm

400
00:21:56,352 --> 00:21:58,400
Or any of those movies he was in

401
00:21:58,912 --> 00:21:59,680
That waiting

402
00:22:00,704 --> 00:22:06,848
He wasn't waiting Ryan Reynolds yeah yeah yeah yeah

403
00:22:07,104 --> 00:22:10,432
At 1

404
00:22:10,688 --> 00:22:11,200
Mr. Brooks

405
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:12,480
Yes

406
00:22:12,736 --> 00:22:18,624
I was going to mr. Deeds

407
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,928
Button-down evil twin Nevada

408
00:22:21,184 --> 00:22:27,328
So Alex is already made the erroneous claim the Gmail blocks Infowars Lakes

409
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:31,680
And I told you ten years ago there Holy Grail will be

410
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:34,496
Certain voice Prince Will now

411
00:22:35,008 --> 00:22:36,544
Facebook doesn't allow the uploading

412
00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:37,824
Any Trump clips

413
00:22:39,616 --> 00:22:41,408
Unless it's by a handful of Select

414
00:22:42,176 --> 00:22:43,456
Control corporate media so

415
00:22:43,968 --> 00:22:46,528
This is authoritarian system

416
00:22:47,296 --> 00:22:48,320
That you could ever imagine

417
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:50,880
Just a quick search on Facebook of recently post

418
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:53,440
Did Trump Clips returns many from Newsmax

419
00:22:53,696 --> 00:22:54,208
To I wouldn't

420
00:22:54,464 --> 00:22:56,256
Call anointed by the mainstream media

421
00:22:56,768 --> 00:23:01,888
Fox News as well as local news channels posted speech at CPAC

422
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,960
Also this is really bad news

423
00:23:05,472 --> 00:23:06,496
For Donald Trump jr.

424
00:23:07,008 --> 00:23:13,152
For him to learn this way that he is one of the handful of anointed mainstream media Outlets

425
00:23:13,408 --> 00:23:13,920
Outlets

426
00:23:14,176 --> 00:23:20,320
Are you know that you that you suck your and you think your anti-establishment then you become the establishment at

427
00:23:21,088 --> 00:23:26,464
He has a page on Facebook with 3.2 million followers

428
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,232
He was posting

429
00:23:27,488 --> 00:23:28,000
Videos of

430
00:23:28,512 --> 00:23:30,304
What just occurred to me

431
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:32,864
What just occurred to me more than anything else

432
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,656
Was with that email thing

433
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:39,008
How could you listen to the show and believe him

434
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,312
When you almost certainly have

435
00:23:41,568 --> 00:23:43,616
Email links to your family

436
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:44,896
That day

437
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:51,552
Do you know what I mean like they are always sending links to each other always sending out emails with

438
00:23:51,808 --> 00:23:54,624
Maybe they just think that they're one of the lucky one

439
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,928
12in Center

440
00:23:57,184 --> 00:24:00,256
Tuesday or maybe they use me like

441
00:24:00,512 --> 00:24:06,656
Whatever his feel like you're getting around

442
00:24:08,192 --> 00:24:09,728
Man

443
00:24:09,984 --> 00:24:15,872
Alex gets to talk about this Politico article and I finally am able to sort out what he's

444
00:24:16,128 --> 00:24:16,896
What is covering

445
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:22,272
Story about it yesterday

446
00:24:23,808 --> 00:24:25,856
And it was posted infowars.com

447
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:27,904
And then of course the Great

448
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:28,672
Carlson

449
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:29,952
Add with it

450
00:24:33,536 --> 00:24:35,328
And now it's all over the news today

451
00:24:36,096 --> 00:24:37,120
Where where is Congress

452
00:24:37,632 --> 00:24:39,168
What are they doing about it

453
00:24:40,192 --> 00:24:41,472
Are some of the headlines breaking

454
00:24:45,312 --> 00:24:47,104
Private text messages reports Politico

455
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:53,504
Okay so that was enough to help me figure out a rock

456
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:58,624
Couldn't do when I have my bad toenail but now that I have applied

457
00:24:59,392 --> 00:25:00,416
But I found a grip

458
00:25:00,672 --> 00:25:03,488
Politico by Natasha korecki

459
00:25:03,744 --> 00:25:04,512
Entitled quotes

460
00:25:04,768 --> 00:25:05,792
Potentially a death set

461
00:25:06,048 --> 00:25:08,096
White House goes off on vaccine fearmonger

462
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:13,472
The sentence from the article that causes intense backlash from Alex and Tucker and all their ilk is this

463
00:25:15,776 --> 00:25:21,920
Including the Democratic National Committee are also planning to engage fact-checkers

464
00:25:22,176 --> 00:25:26,528
Terriers to dispel misinformation about vaccines that are sent over social media and text

465
00:25:27,808 --> 00:25:31,136
That sounds pretty scary but if you read the entirety of the article at

466
00:25:31,392 --> 00:25:34,208
It's pretty clear that what they're talking about is not individual users

467
00:25:34,464 --> 00:25:36,512
But organizations that use text messages

468
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:39,328
Send a messages that are directed towards a road in public health

469
00:25:40,096 --> 00:25:41,376
The article brings up Charlie Kirk

470
00:25:41,632 --> 00:25:42,656
Turning Point USA

471
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:47,776
Turning Point action a 501c for affiliated with tpusa

472
00:25:48,032 --> 00:25:51,872
It also send out SMS messages urging people to sign petitions on the top

473
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:55,456
In what message viewed by Politico Kirk content quote

474
00:25:55,712 --> 00:25:56,736
Find ascendant goon

475
00:25:56,992 --> 00:25:59,808
The door-to-door to make you take a covid-19 vaccine

476
00:26:00,064 --> 00:26:03,904
Sign the petition no more no medical raids in America

477
00:26:04,928 --> 00:26:09,536
This is obviously a problem and when you're in a leadership position do you have to choose what you're going to do

478
00:26:10,048 --> 00:26:16,192
You can try to address the problem of people like Charlie Kirk literally profiting off letting his audience die or you can do nothing

479
00:26:16,704 --> 00:26:18,240
And accepted a certain subset of the population

480
00:26:18,752 --> 00:26:21,312
He's going to be misled off a cliff by this type of messaging

481
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,640
I don't know what the right call would be here and I have no interest

482
00:26:24,896 --> 00:26:27,712
Being in a leadership position because I couldn't solve a problem like that

483
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,016
I can say that I would be on

484
00:26:30,272 --> 00:26:31,296
I'm comfortable with the government

485
00:26:31,552 --> 00:26:35,136
Itself taking action and reading people's text messages and such

486
00:26:35,648 --> 00:26:36,928
If that's what they were doing

487
00:26:37,184 --> 00:26:38,720
Even if it were mastex

488
00:26:38,976 --> 00:26:41,536
It's being sent out by clearly bad faith actors like

489
00:26:41,792 --> 00:26:43,072
Charlie Kirk

490
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:44,352
Thankfully

491
00:26:44,608 --> 00:26:49,216
Natasha korecki the writer of the Politico piece clarified on Twitter what was meant by that sentence

492
00:26:49,472 --> 00:26:50,240
Pittsfield a couple days

493
00:26:50,496 --> 00:26:51,264
Is right wing

494
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,288
Media outrage

495
00:26:53,568 --> 00:26:54,848
As the story points out it's

496
00:26:55,104 --> 00:26:58,176
Allied private groups that are working with SMS carriers

497
00:26:58,432 --> 00:26:58,944
Not the way

498
00:26:59,712 --> 00:27:03,808
Even then there's no ability for groups to read individual texts

499
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,368
Aside from ones they received themselves

500
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:08,416
Disable auto complex

501
00:27:08,672 --> 00:27:09,184
Listen to the story

502
00:27:09,696 --> 00:27:15,072
So these are groups that are allied with the White House that are trying to work with text messaging providers to enlist them

503
00:27:15,328 --> 00:27:18,912
To limit the ability of people like Charlie Kirk to spam this information over the phone

504
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:24,544
They wouldn't be able to read texts prior to them being set it would likely result in the system

505
00:27:25,056 --> 00:27:26,592
If a recipient complain to their text

506
00:27:26,848 --> 00:27:27,872
Provider they look into it

507
00:27:28,128 --> 00:27:29,152
Ask her whether they decided

508
00:27:29,664 --> 00:27:30,688
Was in their company's enter

509
00:27:30,944 --> 00:27:31,456
Contrite

510
00:27:31,968 --> 00:27:35,040
The version of the story that Alex's reporting is entirely dishonest

511
00:27:35,296 --> 00:27:36,320
But there's a kernel of something

512
00:27:36,576 --> 00:27:37,088
Probably

513
00:27:37,344 --> 00:27:39,136
Should be discussed underneath it I think

514
00:27:39,392 --> 00:27:41,952
I don't care about Alex's position on it but it

515
00:27:42,208 --> 00:27:42,720
There's something

516
00:27:43,232 --> 00:27:43,744
There's

517
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:44,512
Something important

518
00:27:45,536 --> 00:27:51,680
There's a really tough question they have to wrestle with and that is should speech that demonstrable put people at risk be as protected as

519
00:27:51,936 --> 00:27:52,704
Is any other kind of spy

520
00:27:53,216 --> 00:27:56,544
And if so at what point does that risk become a problem

521
00:27:57,312 --> 00:27:57,824
It's hard

522
00:27:58,336 --> 00:27:59,360
It's a hard question

523
00:27:59,872 --> 00:28:03,968
The courts have held that you can be charged for encouraging Harmon someone via text message

524
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:07,552
Even though it appeared that that's just you engaging in speech

525
00:28:08,832 --> 00:28:13,952
Michelle Carter was sentenced to 15 months in prison for involuntary manslaughter after she encouraged her boyfriend

526
00:28:14,208 --> 00:28:14,976
To commit suicide

527
00:28:15,744 --> 00:28:19,072
The appeals court upheld her conviction in the Supreme Court decided not to hear the case

528
00:28:19,328 --> 00:28:21,120
Which implies that they didn't consider the ruling

529
00:28:21,376 --> 00:28:23,424
W true infringement of the First Amendment right

530
00:28:24,448 --> 00:28:25,472
This may not be in a

531
00:28:25,728 --> 00:28:27,008
Exact parallel but there

532
00:28:27,264 --> 00:28:29,056
Has been a willingness from courts to rule the

533
00:28:29,312 --> 00:28:30,336
To certain extent

534
00:28:30,592 --> 00:28:34,432
Encouraging harm can constitute speech that is not protected

535
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,992
The direct Armand Carter's cases much

536
00:28:37,248 --> 00:28:42,112
Clearer but when almost everyone dying in the United States of covid is now unvaccinated

537
00:28:42,368 --> 00:28:45,696
It does feel like directly discouraging vaccination through dishonest means

538
00:28:45,952 --> 00:28:48,000
Could be argued to be an attempt to cause harm

539
00:28:48,512 --> 00:28:49,792
I don't know where

540
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:52,608
I don't know and I don't know where the line would be

541
00:28:53,376 --> 00:28:55,424
But I do think that there's probably

542
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,448
Discussion to be had

543
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:00,544
Sparrow far more insightful people than even myself

544
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,080
Certainly more insightful than Alex

545
00:29:02,592 --> 00:29:03,104
Yeah

546
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:03,872
I mean

547
00:29:04,896 --> 00:29:07,968
So I be if I was looking at it I would say the

548
00:29:08,224 --> 00:29:09,248
First thing that you have to

549
00:29:09,504 --> 00:29:10,016
To do

550
00:29:10,528 --> 00:29:13,856
Before you take any action is prove that it's

551
00:29:14,368 --> 00:29:15,392
Malicious and repaired

552
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:19,232
So if they're constantly spamming out malicious

553
00:29:19,744 --> 00:29:20,256
Lies

554
00:29:20,768 --> 00:29:24,864
Then that seems like a much easier way to deal with it than just being like

555
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:25,632
Hey

556
00:29:26,144 --> 00:29:27,936
Blanket you can or can't do this

557
00:29:28,448 --> 00:29:30,240
To allow for error

558
00:29:30,752 --> 00:29:33,312
Say say if you get caught spamming

559
00:29:33,568 --> 00:29:34,080
Flies

560
00:29:34,592 --> 00:29:35,360
Wichita

561
00:29:35,616 --> 00:29:36,896
Hard to tell if they're lies or not

562
00:29:37,152 --> 00:29:41,504
Repeatedly after being told that you can't lie to people anymore then you get

563
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,808
F****** Destroyer finder whatever it is

564
00:29:44,064 --> 00:29:44,832
Did you know

565
00:29:45,088 --> 00:29:47,392
Kind of thing it's not it's not necessarily A

566
00:29:47,648 --> 00:29:49,184
We can ban or unban

567
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:54,560
Speech so much as I would almost even add in a qualifier that there needs to be a profit motive

568
00:29:54,816 --> 00:29:55,328
Live to

569
00:29:55,584 --> 00:29:58,144
Because I think that people can be misled

570
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,424
And sincerely

571
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:01,472
Do harm by way of

572
00:30:02,496 --> 00:30:04,288
Plumbing system

573
00:30:06,336 --> 00:30:08,384
You haven't the wrong information or whatever they can

574
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,176
I think they're doing the right thing

575
00:30:10,432 --> 00:30:14,528
I am do something that is is absolutely involved

576
00:30:14,784 --> 00:30:17,088
Totally I think at least in terms of misinformation

577
00:30:17,344 --> 00:30:20,416
In the case of that girl and her boyfriend

578
00:30:22,208 --> 00:30:24,256
Then been misinformation this early

579
00:30:25,536 --> 00:30:27,840
Do tissues there is that it's not protect

580
00:30:28,864 --> 00:30:29,632
Causing harm

581
00:30:29,888 --> 00:30:31,168
Right it's directing harm

582
00:30:31,424 --> 00:30:32,704
I mean it's it's

583
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:33,728
It's very

584
00:30:36,032 --> 00:30:37,056
In that situation

585
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:40,128
Personal and 121 and in this

586
00:30:40,384 --> 00:30:41,664
Vaccine situation

587
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,200
MedStar creating a mask

588
00:30:43,456 --> 00:30:43,968
Culture

589
00:30:44,224 --> 00:30:44,736
Around

590
00:30:45,248 --> 00:30:46,016
Encouraging harm

591
00:30:46,528 --> 00:30:47,296
Yeah and it's tough

592
00:30:47,552 --> 00:30:48,320
It's tough.

593
00:30:48,576 --> 00:30:49,856
It's tough to know what the

594
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:51,904
What the right thing to do is to

595
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:52,672
Protect

596
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:54,720
Speech the same time

597
00:30:54,976 --> 00:30:56,000
Not allow

598
00:30:57,536 --> 00:30:58,048
Devastation

599
00:30:58,304 --> 00:31:00,352
I'm going to go with

600
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,936
Harris is playing in The Rock

601
00:31:05,216 --> 00:31:05,984
I haven't seen The Rock

602
00:31:06,496 --> 00:31:07,008
Disgrace

603
00:31:07,264 --> 00:31:08,288
I've heard that

604
00:31:08,544 --> 00:31:12,896
That implies that I'm going to watch it and that implication

605
00:31:13,152 --> 00:31:19,296
Is wrong here is Alex being wrong about this

606
00:31:19,552 --> 00:31:20,064
Article

607
00:31:20,576 --> 00:31:23,392
Just save lives

608
00:31:23,904 --> 00:31:25,440
With covid

609
00:31:30,816 --> 00:31:31,584
Criminal

610
00:31:34,656 --> 00:31:37,728
But really the election

611
00:31:38,752 --> 00:31:39,776
We can't let Trump

612
00:31:40,544 --> 00:31:41,824
How to speeches on Facebook

613
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,896
Election

614
00:31:45,408 --> 00:31:47,712
That's not something you're allowed to do that's terrorism

615
00:31:47,968 --> 00:31:50,016
This article literally says nothing about Alexa

616
00:31:50,272 --> 00:31:51,040
Misinformation

617
00:31:51,296 --> 00:31:51,808
Outages

618
00:31:52,064 --> 00:31:53,088
Completely Magnum at all

619
00:31:53,856 --> 00:31:54,368
It's almost

620
00:31:54,624 --> 00:31:59,232
Is entirely about ways the people are trying to fight back against the right-wing misinformation campaign about Biden

621
00:31:59,488 --> 00:32:02,048
Proposed door-to-door awareness Outreach about the vaccination

622
00:32:02,816 --> 00:32:04,352
Campaign like people saying it's going to be

623
00:32:04,608 --> 00:32:07,168
People coming to your door with needles and stuff

624
00:32:08,448 --> 00:32:08,960
People

625
00:32:09,216 --> 00:32:10,240
From the community

626
00:32:10,752 --> 00:32:11,776
Coming around

627
00:32:13,312 --> 00:32:15,104
You know it's easier than you might think

628
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:16,128
To go get a shot

629
00:32:17,152 --> 00:32:18,432
If you think that there are hurdles

630
00:32:18,688 --> 00:32:19,968
And you would like to get a shot

631
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:27,136
No I mean it do you think it's too expensive guess what it's not

632
00:32:27,392 --> 00:32:27,904
It's not

633
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:28,672
Yeah but that's

634
00:32:28,928 --> 00:32:31,488
That's really what the campaign is answer this article is about

635
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:32,768
Dog just

636
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:35,840
The what do you do about the incessant

637
00:32:36,608 --> 00:32:38,144
Misinformation surrounding

638
00:32:38,656 --> 00:32:39,424
These things

639
00:32:40,192 --> 00:32:41,984
Dressing up as Jehovah's Witnesses

640
00:32:43,008 --> 00:32:43,776
That's the trick

641
00:32:44,544 --> 00:32:47,616
Everybody expects Jehovah's Witness to come to your door sooner or later

642
00:32:47,872 --> 00:32:49,408
That's what they've got going on

643
00:32:49,664 --> 00:32:52,480
I don't feel I don't I don't feel like you're going to get

644
00:32:52,992 --> 00:32:54,528
The warmest welcome true

645
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:57,344
But I guess you're probably not if you're not going to

646
00:32:57,856 --> 00:32:58,368
Right away

647
00:32:58,624 --> 00:33:04,256
Probably not knock on the door

648
00:33:04,512 --> 00:33:05,536
Election misinformation

649
00:33:05,792 --> 00:33:07,072
I also lies a bit more

650
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:09,120
That's what scares me the most of time

651
00:33:09,632 --> 00:33:10,912
It's hard to break the big story

652
00:33:11,424 --> 00:33:12,448
The debates fines were there

653
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:13,984
Calling something out quietly

654
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:21,664
SMS messages

655
00:33:24,224 --> 00:33:28,320
And that of course ladies and gentlemen is it such a loss in ATL already reading ever

656
00:33:30,624 --> 00:33:32,416
They want to announce it and normalizing

657
00:33:32,672 --> 00:33:36,256
The edl and sblc you're not mentioned once in the Politico article

658
00:33:36,512 --> 00:33:37,024
I guess Alex

659
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:38,560
Could just read the term Biden

660
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:40,352
Allied groups and assume that's

661
00:33:40,864 --> 00:33:43,168
Which groups the Articles talking about but that's no better than

662
00:33:43,424 --> 00:33:44,448
Just a guess on his part

663
00:33:44,704 --> 00:33:46,496
He's reporting this based on nothing

664
00:33:47,008 --> 00:33:47,520
Yeah it's just

665
00:33:49,312 --> 00:33:51,104
That's a straight-up bulshit since talkingshit

666
00:33:52,896 --> 00:33:55,712
Might as well sblc natrez enemies

667
00:33:56,736 --> 00:33:59,552
The audience's prime to think demons

668
00:34:00,064 --> 00:34:00,576
That why not

669
00:34:01,088 --> 00:34:04,160
So Alex brings up a clip that he covered a couple weeks

670
00:34:04,416 --> 00:34:04,928
It's back here

671
00:34:05,184 --> 00:34:05,696
Man

672
00:34:05,952 --> 00:34:08,000
This this is metastasized

673
00:34:08,768 --> 00:34:11,584
What did the Canadian Health minister

674
00:34:12,864 --> 00:34:14,912
Martial law

675
00:34:15,168 --> 00:34:16,960
People will protest our government

676
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:18,752
No speeches allowed

677
00:34:19,008 --> 00:34:19,520
Apply

678
00:34:19,776 --> 00:34:20,800
DDC the

679
00:34:21,824 --> 00:34:23,104
Authoritarianism

680
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:25,408
They're just

681
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:33,088
This is a complete mess representation of what Nova scotian Health official Doctor Strange said in a clip Alex covered whew-wee

682
00:34:33,344 --> 00:34:33,856
Respect

683
00:34:34,112 --> 00:34:40,256
Just made an offhand comment about one of the advantages of large Gatherings not happening is that it limits the ability of people spread

684
00:34:40,512 --> 00:34:41,024
Misinformation

685
00:34:41,536 --> 00:34:44,096
From Gathering and disseminating dangerous public health messages

686
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:46,400
The broader context of the video is

687
00:34:46,656 --> 00:34:51,264
We talked about is Strang and Premiere ranking Fielding questions about whether or not it was wise of them

688
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:53,056
To open up schools and businesses

689
00:34:53,312 --> 00:34:54,336
Which they were doing

690
00:34:54,848 --> 00:34:58,688
How to completely making up all the surrounding context of this clip most likely cuz he does

691
00:34:58,944 --> 00:35:00,480
Steven actually remember what was said

692
00:35:01,504 --> 00:35:03,040
You get the strong sense that

693
00:35:04,064 --> 00:35:08,672
At a certain point only remembers the fake version of things that use repeated

694
00:35:08,928 --> 00:35:10,976
On his show and that's kind of troubling

695
00:35:11,232 --> 00:35:13,536
Yeah there's there's definitely a pattern of life

696
00:35:13,792 --> 00:35:15,072
Eventually he convinced

697
00:35:15,328 --> 00:35:20,704
Is himself and it goes from short-term memory into long-term bulshit a self-reinforcing

698
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:21,728
Artificial

699
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:24,032
Facade

700
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:24,800
He's his own fee

701
00:35:25,312 --> 00:35:27,104
Back loop it's weird

702
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:28,128
It is weird

703
00:35:29,408 --> 00:35:32,480
Terrifying the irony though that entire press

704
00:35:32,736 --> 00:35:38,880
Friends really being about how they were opening up and people were concerned that it was too early

705
00:35:39,136 --> 00:35:41,440
He's never going to end

706
00:35:41,696 --> 00:35:42,720
Add stats

707
00:35:43,232 --> 00:35:46,048
You know I mean he's right

708
00:35:46,304 --> 00:35:50,400
Come out and say it's martial law and no one is allowed to speak offline

709
00:35:50,656 --> 00:35:51,424
Would be tyranny

710
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:57,312
Wow he was talking about how he had already relaxed martial law haha

711
00:35:57,824 --> 00:36:03,968
Yeah we're free journalists were concerned about public health are we ready

712
00:36:04,224 --> 00:36:06,016
Earl is there like a man I don't know

713
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:07,808
So

714
00:36:08,064 --> 00:36:09,600
This is staggering

715
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:17,280
More covid-19 vaccine deaths last week

716
00:36:17,792 --> 00:36:19,840
And he lasted covid-19 deaths

717
00:36:22,144 --> 00:36:23,680
That's it official number

718
00:36:23,936 --> 00:36:25,216
Doesn't sound right

719
00:36:27,776 --> 00:36:29,824
Whatever he brings up something incongruous

720
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:32,128
That doesn't sound like a good happen

721
00:36:32,384 --> 00:36:35,456
Don't seem like he ever entertained the possibility that it actually could

722
00:36:35,968 --> 00:36:39,040
I was waiting for him to explain what the f***

723
00:36:39,296 --> 00:36:41,600
He was basing this off of

724
00:36:41,856 --> 00:36:43,136
Until about the end of

725
00:36:43,392 --> 00:36:47,232
The show any just make a passing reference to Gateway pundit article

726
00:36:47,488 --> 00:36:51,328
I tried to find it basically all that it it's rooted in is

727
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:55,936
That there are reports of like 9,000 people who have died after taking

728
00:36:56,448 --> 00:36:56,960
The vaccine

729
00:36:57,216 --> 00:37:00,032
Okay that doesn't mean the 9,000 people died from the back

730
00:37:00,288 --> 00:37:04,896
Actually now that doesn't sound right at all

731
00:37:05,408 --> 00:37:06,688
40 *

732
00:37:06,944 --> 00:37:11,040
I like only one in 40 vaccine side effects

733
00:37:11,296 --> 00:37:12,832
Whatever numbers

734
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:14,880
Elsa

735
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,440
It's a little bit dumb

736
00:37:18,464 --> 00:37:19,488
Yes

737
00:37:19,744 --> 00:37:21,536
So we know that Alex

738
00:37:21,792 --> 00:37:23,072
Believes that

739
00:37:24,608 --> 00:37:25,120
Bulshit

740
00:37:25,632 --> 00:37:26,912
Except when people

741
00:37:27,168 --> 00:37:27,680
30 likes with

742
00:37:28,192 --> 00:37:30,240
Not b******* never

743
00:37:33,056 --> 00:37:34,336
Got in fraudulently

744
00:37:36,384 --> 00:37:37,408
Being elected

745
00:37:37,664 --> 00:37:41,248
Merkel has been installed macron has been installed

746
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:45,088
Johnson got elected posing as a patriot he's as bad as they come

747
00:37:45,344 --> 00:37:46,112
In the UK

748
00:37:47,136 --> 00:37:47,648
Didn't take long

749
00:37:48,416 --> 00:37:49,184
I'm going

750
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:49,952
To cover

751
00:37:50,464 --> 00:37:52,512
That in the last segment of this hour

752
00:37:54,048 --> 00:37:54,560
The fact that

753
00:37:54,816 --> 00:37:55,584
We are not

754
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:56,864
Anymore

755
00:37:57,632 --> 00:37:58,656
Things are not going to get better

756
00:37:59,936 --> 00:38:00,960
Loretta

757
00:38:01,472 --> 00:38:01,984
I got to be around

758
00:38:02,752 --> 00:38:04,544
So on politicians Alex doesn't like

759
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:05,312
Fraudulent

760
00:38:05,568 --> 00:38:08,384
Tucker power fraudulently

761
00:38:08,896 --> 00:38:09,408
Now

762
00:38:09,664 --> 00:38:10,944
He does not like

763
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,992
The UK Boris

764
00:38:13,248 --> 00:38:14,272
Boris Johnson

765
00:38:15,808 --> 00:38:16,832
He did really well

766
00:38:17,088 --> 00:38:18,624
Pretended to be a patriot

767
00:38:20,672 --> 00:38:22,464
I do I do appreciate that

768
00:38:22,976 --> 00:38:23,488
The far-right

769
00:38:24,256 --> 00:38:27,072
Like the only possible way to be like me

770
00:38:27,328 --> 00:38:29,120
Immediately hated

771
00:38:29,376 --> 00:38:34,496
If you do one thing they don't like like that that idea of Boris being like hey

772
00:38:36,032 --> 00:38:36,800
Even I

773
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:39,872
The sociopath I am

774
00:38:40,384 --> 00:38:42,176
I'm like we can't let another

775
00:38:42,688 --> 00:38:43,712
Ton of people die

776
00:38:44,224 --> 00:38:45,504
I can't do that

777
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:51,904
I'm not bolsonaro bolsonaro will let everybody died Trump will let everybody died

778
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:58,304
Talk about people for one moment my conscience existed and now the far-right thinks I'm done

779
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:00,352
You're pretending exactly

780
00:39:00,608 --> 00:39:03,168
It took 60 seconds release

781
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:04,960
Surprising how many chances

782
00:39:05,216 --> 00:39:05,728
Trump has been

783
00:39:05,984 --> 00:39:09,568
When given a million billion

784
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:10,592
Thanks

785
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:11,360
Bike racks

786
00:39:12,128 --> 00:39:12,896
But

787
00:39:13,152 --> 00:39:14,432
The other thing too is there like

788
00:39:14,944 --> 00:39:19,296
I think that Alex just doesn't know anything about what bolsonaro does or State score

789
00:39:19,552 --> 00:39:21,600
Because of that he gets a million chances

790
00:39:23,392 --> 00:39:25,440
Themes of power

791
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:29,280
Described as a few Rambo

792
00:39:30,816 --> 00:39:32,096
Official database

793
00:39:32,352 --> 00:39:34,656
More deaths from vaccines last week

794
00:39:34,912 --> 00:39:36,448
From the supposed covid shot

795
00:39:38,496 --> 00:39:40,032
Covers

796
00:39:40,288 --> 00:39:41,568
They're making their move

797
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:44,384
And I told you that

798
00:39:46,432 --> 00:39:49,504
Icon with more control than before

799
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:52,576
And now that's being done exactly as I said

800
00:39:52,832 --> 00:39:54,368
Because it's an enemy plan

801
00:39:55,392 --> 00:39:58,208
Everybody legislators

802
00:39:58,464 --> 00:40:00,000
And governors and Society

803
00:40:00,256 --> 00:40:02,048
And shoving corporations and businesses

804
00:40:02,304 --> 00:40:05,888
Does the first vaccine passports

805
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:08,192
Once they get their world ID

806
00:40:12,288 --> 00:40:13,056
What you can do

807
00:40:13,312 --> 00:40:14,080
What you can eat

808
00:40:19,712 --> 00:40:20,480
Mobile

809
00:40:20,736 --> 00:40:21,248
Internet

810
00:40:21,504 --> 00:40:23,296
Ideas for social Credit Control

811
00:40:24,064 --> 00:40:25,088
It is for surveillance

812
00:40:26,112 --> 00:40:28,416
It's all be shoehorned in under the name of covid

813
00:40:30,464 --> 00:40:32,000
And Center Spencer them for covid

814
00:40:32,256 --> 00:40:34,304
Another news

815
00:40:35,328 --> 00:40:37,120
Bombshell over-the-top

816
00:40:37,376 --> 00:40:38,144
Unprecedented

817
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,680
Also not true

818
00:40:40,192 --> 00:40:46,336
Yeah boo you know it's just sometimes you really want to like grab these people and just shake the

819
00:40:46,592 --> 00:40:47,616
Them by the shoulders and be like

820
00:40:47,872 --> 00:40:48,896
The whole point

821
00:40:49,408 --> 00:40:51,968
Is it despite how awful you are

822
00:40:52,224 --> 00:40:54,784
I am still trying to not kill you

823
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:55,808
Birthday idea

824
00:40:57,344 --> 00:40:58,368
Where You Are

825
00:40:58,624 --> 00:41:01,184
Makes me not want to care if you live or die

826
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:05,536
And I think that's one of the things that makes

827
00:41:05,792 --> 00:41:07,328
This question about these

828
00:41:07,584 --> 00:41:08,352
These spam

829
00:41:08,608 --> 00:41:10,912
Messages that are detrimental to Public Health so

830
00:41:11,168 --> 00:41:12,448
Challenging is that like

831
00:41:12,704 --> 00:41:14,240
The alternative to

832
00:41:14,496 --> 00:41:17,312
Trying to find a solution to it is just cutting your losses and

833
00:41:17,568 --> 00:41:19,872
Just being like wow these people are just going to die

834
00:41:20,128 --> 00:41:21,408
Far right is just going to lose

835
00:41:21,664 --> 00:41:27,808
I guess 3% and then we'll move on next f****** nightmare it terrific disagree with

836
00:41:28,064 --> 00:41:28,832
Fundamental

837
00:41:29,088 --> 00:41:30,624
Difference

838
00:41:31,392 --> 00:41:31,904
That mean even

839
00:41:32,928 --> 00:41:33,952
The piano as far as

840
00:41:34,208 --> 00:41:38,560
They could be tenable the different than ideas about reality

841
00:41:39,072 --> 00:41:40,096
Walk them to

842
00:41:40,352 --> 00:41:41,376
Be healthy

843
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:44,704
Why is this hard

844
00:41:45,216 --> 00:41:45,728
Yeah

845
00:41:46,496 --> 00:41:47,264
So

846
00:41:47,776 --> 00:41:48,288
Alex

847
00:41:48,544 --> 00:41:51,104
His big thing here is as I got to read your text

848
00:41:51,616 --> 00:41:52,128
That's just right

849
00:41:52,384 --> 00:41:53,407
Joanne so in order to

850
00:41:53,663 --> 00:41:55,711
To strengthen this he needs to harken back

851
00:41:55,967 --> 00:41:57,247
Do when he was kicked off Facebook

852
00:41:58,015 --> 00:42:01,087
At the time there was an interview that Oliver Darcy

853
00:42:01,343 --> 00:42:02,623
We did I think I'm CNN

854
00:42:03,391 --> 00:42:04,927
And they're discussing him being King

855
00:42:05,183 --> 00:42:05,695
Kick-off Alex

856
00:42:05,951 --> 00:42:06,463
Who kicked off

857
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:08,255
Instagram and Facebook

858
00:42:08,511 --> 00:42:12,607
Cuz they both owned by the same company at the time there was some question if Alex is going to be

859
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:15,167
Kick-off WhatsApp cuz it was also owned by Facebook

860
00:42:15,679 --> 00:42:18,751
And Oliver Darcy said they didn't know if he had an account

861
00:42:19,263 --> 00:42:20,287
Salix Place necklace

862
00:42:20,543 --> 00:42:22,591
Greatly exaggerated what he say

863
00:42:24,639 --> 00:42:25,919
Almost 2 years ago

864
00:42:26,175 --> 00:42:27,967
Talking about what it's really all about

865
00:42:28,223 --> 00:42:29,759
Silence

866
00:42:32,575 --> 00:42:33,855
Did everybody ever figures out that

867
00:42:34,367 --> 00:42:36,671
I'm telling you this not my opinion

868
00:42:37,183 --> 00:42:37,951
Over

869
00:42:38,207 --> 00:42:39,743
Taking you to a hellish

870
00:42:40,255 --> 00:42:40,767
Dystopian

871
00:42:41,279 --> 00:42:42,559
You're seeing him for two years ago

872
00:42:44,095 --> 00:42:46,655
3 Banning Alex Jones and Infowars

873
00:42:46,911 --> 00:42:48,191
For now only there

874
00:42:48,447 --> 00:42:49,983
On Facebook but also from Instagram

875
00:42:50,239 --> 00:42:53,055
Am I checked in also to see if these people would be banned from WhatsApp

876
00:42:53,311 --> 00:42:54,591
Which is also owned by a face

877
00:42:55,103 --> 00:42:55,615
What the heck

878
00:42:56,127 --> 00:42:57,663
Person cannot say immediately because it's

879
00:42:57,919 --> 00:42:58,943
Unclear

880
00:42:59,199 --> 00:43:00,479
Whether some of these people have

881
00:43:00,991 --> 00:43:01,503
What type of

882
00:43:02,783 --> 00:43:04,575
Text message

883
00:43:06,367 --> 00:43:09,183
Do you have a house for children to be on a gun

884
00:43:09,439 --> 00:43:13,279
Next

885
00:43:14,815 --> 00:43:16,607
Olivia couldn't buy a house on Facebook

886
00:43:17,887 --> 00:43:19,167
Yeah there's another

887
00:43:19,679 --> 00:43:21,215
Whole section of the internet

888
00:43:21,471 --> 00:43:24,287
There's always find all kinds of stuff

889
00:43:24,543 --> 00:43:26,335
You could use your

890
00:43:26,591 --> 00:43:29,919
Also I don't know if Alex didn't have a WhatsApp account

891
00:43:30,175 --> 00:43:31,967
No I think this conversation is stupid

892
00:43:32,223 --> 00:43:37,855
Don't care you completely misrepresenting this has nothing to do with this guy can't privately text you both

893
00:43:38,879 --> 00:43:40,927
You know I think he realizes that like that

894
00:43:41,183 --> 00:43:42,719
That clip is not as damning as

895
00:43:42,975 --> 00:43:43,999
I remember it being

896
00:43:44,255 --> 00:43:48,095
I have built it up by repeating the story over and over again to myself

897
00:43:48,351 --> 00:43:50,655
That it said something far more damning than it does

898
00:43:50,911 --> 00:43:52,703
I think this is Alex's attempt to save it

899
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:01,151
Text messages

900
00:44:01,663 --> 00:44:04,223
Yeah Alex Jones is getting around as his fans are

901
00:44:04,479 --> 00:44:06,783
Still on air via text message

902
00:44:07,295 --> 00:44:09,599
We've just got to get in those text messages we just

903
00:44:11,135 --> 00:44:13,439
You know you're right

904
00:44:13,951 --> 00:44:16,511
He just got to get in that private email those text message

905
00:44:16,767 --> 00:44:18,047
Just yeah where's a good guy

906
00:44:18,303 --> 00:44:20,863
What those dirty Americans talk

907
00:44:21,375 --> 00:44:24,447
Shut them up right now don't worry we will though

908
00:44:24,959 --> 00:44:25,727
Are the bad guys

909
00:44:25,983 --> 00:44:27,775
The damn shame we can't find that clip

910
00:44:29,311 --> 00:44:29,823
I feel like

911
00:44:30,847 --> 00:44:32,127
After a certain length of

912
00:44:32,383 --> 00:44:34,687
The time listening to the show on the regular

913
00:44:34,943 --> 00:44:36,223
Eventually you'd go

914
00:44:36,735 --> 00:44:42,879
It is strange that they can never find the clip that says what Alex says the clip says

915
00:44:43,135 --> 00:44:44,671
Weird play the clip

916
00:44:44,927 --> 00:44:45,951
Doesn't say what Alec

917
00:44:46,975 --> 00:44:50,303
They can find the clips that don't say what Alex says yeah

918
00:44:50,559 --> 00:44:53,887
But they can't find the clips Dulce with Alex

919
00:44:54,143 --> 00:44:55,935
It's weird yeah

920
00:44:56,191 --> 00:44:56,959
Or suspicious

921
00:44:57,215 --> 00:45:00,287
Almost always

922
00:45:00,799 --> 00:45:04,127
Desperately crying out for context

923
00:45:05,151 --> 00:45:06,943
Eclipse that can find it like

924
00:45:08,735 --> 00:45:10,015
And then

925
00:45:11,295 --> 00:45:13,087
So Alex is like maybe

926
00:45:13,343 --> 00:45:14,111
They clear the lake

927
00:45:14,623 --> 00:45:15,135
Stuff coming up

928
00:45:15,647 --> 00:45:16,671
Come up

929
00:45:16,927 --> 00:45:18,463
Getting real and yeah

930
00:45:19,743 --> 00:45:20,255
Get up

931
00:45:20,511 --> 00:45:21,279
You know it's going to happen

932
00:45:21,791 --> 00:45:22,303
In America

933
00:45:22,815 --> 00:45:23,327
Everybody

934
00:45:23,583 --> 00:45:24,095
Wow

935
00:45:25,887 --> 00:45:26,911
Looking for work

936
00:45:27,167 --> 00:45:29,471
Not in the next segment

937
00:45:32,031 --> 00:45:32,799
Explain

938
00:45:37,407 --> 00:45:38,943
And slowly destroy us

939
00:45:40,223 --> 00:45:43,039
Going to look like

940
00:45:43,295 --> 00:45:44,831
Man if we don't turn this around

941
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:47,391
I would suggest you record this

942
00:45:47,903 --> 00:45:51,743
Because you were unable to stop them very soon

943
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:52,511
To hear

944
00:45:53,023 --> 00:45:56,607
About to be on the Garry Moore and that's in the coal mine

945
00:45:57,375 --> 00:45:59,679
Really for the end of this phase

946
00:46:00,447 --> 00:46:03,519
And there's going to be a horrible future

947
00:46:04,031 --> 00:46:05,055
For Humanity

948
00:46:05,311 --> 00:46:07,359
I really tried to warn everybody as best I could

949
00:46:13,247 --> 00:46:14,527
This is a forced disc

950
00:46:15,551 --> 00:46:16,319
I've got a recording

951
00:46:16,831 --> 00:46:17,599
Also it's

952
00:46:17,855 --> 00:46:22,463
So funny to me that Alex is pretending his any room left to claim that his enemies are going to

953
00:46:22,719 --> 00:46:25,279
Close some metaphorical Neuse in the next few years

954
00:46:25,791 --> 00:46:28,607
Like 6 months ago back when he was prowling around with David Icke

955
00:46:28,863 --> 00:46:31,679
Can trying to see if there was money to be made and just denying the covid even

956
00:46:31,935 --> 00:46:32,447
Existed

957
00:46:32,703 --> 00:46:34,751
Alex became enamored with a metaphor that I could

958
00:46:35,007 --> 00:46:35,519
Could use regular

959
00:46:36,287 --> 00:46:37,823
I could describe a room

960
00:46:38,335 --> 00:46:43,199
It's a bad room you don't to be in that room like an interrogation room

961
00:46:43,455 --> 00:46:45,759
Somehow the globalist to lure you into the room

962
00:46:46,015 --> 00:46:46,527
Which seems

963
00:46:46,783 --> 00:46:49,599
Because the door is open you can always good I can run away

964
00:46:50,367 --> 00:46:51,135
According to David Icke

965
00:46:51,647 --> 00:46:53,183
It's through the release of a completely

966
00:46:53,439 --> 00:46:57,279
We made up a virus and I guess for Alex you somewhere close to that

967
00:46:57,791 --> 00:46:58,815
Dolittle

968
00:46:59,071 --> 00:47:01,375
Less absurd

969
00:47:02,399 --> 00:47:08,543
Get you in the room and another door closes in your trash

970
00:47:08,799 --> 00:47:09,567
Alex's deploying with

971
00:47:09,823 --> 00:47:10,591
The closing of the news

972
00:47:11,103 --> 00:47:12,639
Burberry long stretch Alex Wood

973
00:47:12,895 --> 00:47:17,503
Consistently repeat David Icke metaphor about the door being closed now and how we're stuck in the room with

974
00:47:17,759 --> 00:47:18,527
The globalist

975
00:47:18,783 --> 00:47:20,063
It was months ago

976
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:24,415
There's a zero credibility and I'm playing this game now with slightly different words

977
00:47:24,671 --> 00:47:28,255
Like did we find a way out of the metaphorical room only to end up in a noose

978
00:47:28,511 --> 00:47:30,047
Is the news in the room

979
00:47:30,303 --> 00:47:32,607
Well what happens is

980
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:35,935
You go in the room they lower you in cuz the room is filled with chalk

981
00:47:36,191 --> 00:47:38,751
Chocolate all kinds of good chocolate all kind of bonbons

982
00:47:39,007 --> 00:47:40,543
Close the door behind you

983
00:47:40,799 --> 00:47:42,847
Boom what pops out of the two-way mirror

984
00:47:43,103 --> 00:47:45,407
Raptor and we know what they do to you if you

985
00:47:45,919 --> 00:47:46,431
F****** chalk

986
00:47:46,687 --> 00:47:47,967
Chocolate man

987
00:47:48,223 --> 00:47:49,247
Chocolate mousse

988
00:47:50,271 --> 00:47:51,039
Chocolate News

989
00:47:51,295 --> 00:47:56,671
It wasn't great.

990
00:47:58,975 --> 00:48:01,023
Alex makes a claim in this next week that he cannot backup

991
00:48:02,047 --> 00:48:03,583
You understand

992
00:48:04,095 --> 00:48:06,143
Double din

993
00:48:11,007 --> 00:48:12,799
This isn't a Zombie Apocalypse movie

994
00:48:13,311 --> 00:48:15,359
This is a controlled demolition of the planet

995
00:48:15,615 --> 00:48:16,895
Please substantiate.

996
00:48:17,663 --> 00:48:18,175
Please

997
00:48:18,687 --> 00:48:20,991
Prime is double triple and quadruple all over the place

998
00:48:22,271 --> 00:48:23,551
Where's the data coming from

999
00:48:23,807 --> 00:48:26,879
How do you define crime what is going on here this is a meaningless

1000
00:48:27,647 --> 00:48:28,159
No it's

1001
00:48:30,975 --> 00:48:33,023
Basic questions are things that he should be addressing

1002
00:48:33,279 --> 00:48:34,047
Unless they are

1003
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:36,863
The Listener should just feel free to just ignore this cashier

1004
00:48:37,375 --> 00:48:38,399
The temperature stalking nonsense

1005
00:48:38,911 --> 00:48:39,679
Yeah I don't know if

1006
00:48:39,935 --> 00:48:41,215
I don't know if we can live in

1007
00:48:41,471 --> 00:48:43,263
2021 now and listen

1008
00:48:43,775 --> 00:48:46,335
I mean read and watch all of these people

1009
00:48:46,591 --> 00:48:47,359
Redo

1010
00:48:47,615 --> 00:48:49,919
The f****** late 80s with super-predator

1011
00:48:50,175 --> 00:48:51,455
Do not immediately go like

1012
00:48:51,711 --> 00:48:53,247
Oh this is all massively races

1013
00:48:53,503 --> 00:48:54,783
This is horrific

1014
00:48:55,295 --> 00:48:58,367
All of this like all crime is getting out of control s*** despite

1015
00:48:58,623 --> 00:49:00,159
The fact that it's been lower than it has been

1016
00:49:00,415 --> 00:49:01,951
The f****** 60 there whatever

1017
00:49:02,207 --> 00:49:04,767
There's no way you can't see that is like

1018
00:49:05,023 --> 00:49:06,559
We're trying to get more black people in jail

1019
00:49:06,815 --> 00:49:08,607
We're running low on fire fighting

1020
00:49:08,863 --> 00:49:09,375
Slaves

1021
00:49:09,631 --> 00:49:10,143
Like that's

1022
00:49:10,911 --> 00:49:11,423
So

1023
00:49:12,191 --> 00:49:14,495
Alex's got some plans

1024
00:49:14,751 --> 00:49:15,263
For dinner

1025
00:49:16,287 --> 00:49:21,151
I wish I wasn't how I was going to set up this Cliff face Alex's dinner plans

1026
00:49:22,175 --> 00:49:22,687
This morning

1027
00:49:24,479 --> 00:49:26,271
I got my parents coming over for dinner tonight

1028
00:49:27,295 --> 00:49:28,319
I'm just going to tell him

1029
00:49:32,927 --> 00:49:34,207
How we protect ourselves

1030
00:49:36,511 --> 00:49:39,327
Because we tried to stop.

1031
00:49:40,095 --> 00:49:40,863
Lockstep

1032
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:44,191
We tried to stop the initiation of this they did it anyways

1033
00:49:44,447 --> 00:49:46,751
I would give anything to be there for that dinner

1034
00:49:47,007 --> 00:49:53,151
I would watch that watch that for sure that would be way more exciting than my Dinner with Andre for sure

1035
00:49:53,407 --> 00:49:56,735
I liked my Dinner with Andre but this is the s***

1036
00:49:56,991 --> 00:50:03,135
This is like the Fast and Furious version of My Dinner with Andre I don't believe that this conversation happen

1037
00:50:03,391 --> 00:50:04,159
Yelp

1038
00:50:04,415 --> 00:50:05,183
Absolutely.

1039
00:50:07,999 --> 00:50:08,511
Absolutely

1040
00:50:08,767 --> 00:50:14,655
That looks all better off we got to I got to survive

1041
00:50:16,447 --> 00:50:21,055
Alright so whatever pizza tonight or what

1042
00:50:21,311 --> 00:50:21,823
What the hell

1043
00:50:22,335 --> 00:50:23,871
Just have another beer

1044
00:50:24,639 --> 00:50:25,663
So I dude

1045
00:50:25,919 --> 00:50:29,247
This is this is where things get very interesting

1046
00:50:29,759 --> 00:50:32,319
So we've got a situation on our hands right now

1047
00:50:33,855 --> 00:50:35,391
And you know the globalist

1048
00:50:35,647 --> 00:50:36,671
They plan to do all day

1049
00:50:37,183 --> 00:50:38,719
Everything is happening is playing

1050
00:50:39,487 --> 00:50:40,255
But the timeline

1051
00:50:40,767 --> 00:50:44,863
Who is the five years behind we tried to stop the initiation of this they did it anyway

1052
00:50:48,703 --> 00:50:49,215
Why but

1053
00:50:49,983 --> 00:50:51,519
Just to give you a Prelude

1054
00:50:51,775 --> 00:50:54,847
They had to because we expose our long-term strategic plan

1055
00:50:55,103 --> 00:50:56,639
We're always going to do what they're doing

1056
00:51:02,271 --> 00:51:03,807
All these countries around the world

1057
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:06,111
They had an accelerated program

1058
00:51:07,135 --> 00:51:08,671
Are all in their committed

1059
00:51:10,207 --> 00:51:16,351
Yeah as soon as I heard that one balloon fell from the roof absolutely

1060
00:51:16,607 --> 00:51:22,751
Look up to my apartment

1061
00:51:23,519 --> 00:51:27,615
It started playing episodes Ramos in 2017 and 25th

1062
00:51:27,871 --> 00:51:34,015
Teen in 2009 and here's 100003 they ten years behind their always ten years behind

1063
00:51:34,271 --> 00:51:36,063
So you why coming up after the break

1064
00:51:36,319 --> 00:51:42,463
That's because Alex is expose their plans or something over the last 30 years

1065
00:51:42,719 --> 00:51:46,559
Push them back any further than 10 years behind it's kind of been more status-quo thing

1066
00:51:46,815 --> 00:51:48,863
He's fighting the f****** devil

1067
00:51:51,679 --> 00:51:52,191
Grifols

1068
00:51:52,447 --> 00:51:54,751
Devil does not care about 10 years

1069
00:51:57,311 --> 00:52:03,455
The devil has existed for 10,000 years and less than 1/10

1070
00:52:03,711 --> 00:52:08,319
What percentage of the devil looking at his watch in the tapping his hoof

1071
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:15,231
Call man

1072
00:52:15,487 --> 00:52:17,023
Really scary in this neck

1073
00:52:20,095 --> 00:52:21,119
Going to stop

1074
00:52:21,631 --> 00:52:22,655
Just go ahead and get this out now

1075
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:29,311
Bio weapons

1076
00:52:29,567 --> 00:52:30,591
If we tried to overthrow

1077
00:52:34,175 --> 00:52:34,687
You did

1078
00:52:34,943 --> 00:52:35,711
Give me type

1079
00:52:35,967 --> 00:52:36,479
Populist

1080
00:52:36,735 --> 00:52:40,831
Christian group

1081
00:52:42,623 --> 00:52:45,695
They're always planned the depopulation regardless later once they

1082
00:52:51,583 --> 00:52:56,447
In an attempt to maintain control

1083
00:52:56,703 --> 00:52:58,239
One way or another Associated plan

1084
00:52:58,751 --> 00:53:02,079
Okay

1085
00:53:02,335 --> 00:53:04,639
And succeed or your makeup do it next year

1086
00:53:04,895 --> 00:53:05,663
Maybe next month

1087
00:53:05,919 --> 00:53:08,991
This is one of the more f***** up things I think I've ever heard Alex

1088
00:53:09,247 --> 00:53:15,391
Suggested I mean that since you're late because ultimately there's no art team of villains that are being antagonized by his

1089
00:53:15,903 --> 00:53:21,023
Nope I find a challenging to even come up with the right words to condemn this because honestly

1090
00:53:21,279 --> 00:53:26,399
What can you possibly be advocating for other than vigilante action against his imagined enemies or

1091
00:53:26,655 --> 00:53:27,423
Acts of domestic Terror

1092
00:53:28,191 --> 00:53:32,543
You're about to be murdered in 10 years or you can die fighting now

1093
00:53:32,799 --> 00:53:35,359
I know that we heard Alex discuss how the globalist

1094
00:53:35,615 --> 00:53:40,735
Prefer an orderly killing of everyone but Alex and his friends are screwed because the globalist have plan B which is

1095
00:53:42,015 --> 00:53:43,039
With superb Iowa

1096
00:53:43,551 --> 00:53:48,927
What I haven't heard Alex Advocate is that his audience should engage in actions that they would

1097
00:53:49,183 --> 00:53:49,695
Think would

1098
00:53:49,951 --> 00:53:50,975
Escalate things towards

1099
00:53:51,231 --> 00:53:52,767
Plan B coming into play

1100
00:53:53,279 --> 00:53:57,631
That is a bizarre and terrifying version of fantasy-based accelerationism

1101
00:53:58,143 --> 00:53:59,167
There is no group.

1102
00:53:59,423 --> 00:54:02,495
The threatening to kill off the public in 10 years or possibly a year or a month

1103
00:54:03,007 --> 00:54:06,079
That's a creation of Alex's inability or unwillingness to read

1104
00:54:06,335 --> 00:54:07,615
Combined with his intense breed

1105
00:54:07,871 --> 00:54:08,895
Any psychotic worlds

1106
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:10,943
No actions that Alex's audience

1107
00:54:11,199 --> 00:54:15,807
Takes can make it any more or less likely that a worldwide biotech kill-off is going to happen

1108
00:54:16,319 --> 00:54:19,135
Because that's just a paranoid fantasy that uses to make money

1109
00:54:19,647 --> 00:54:20,927
But people are real

1110
00:54:21,183 --> 00:54:23,231
Any actions that his audience could taken in Tempe

1111
00:54:23,487 --> 00:54:25,023
Disrupt the global is supposed to plant

1112
00:54:25,279 --> 00:54:27,327
Kill everyone in an orderly fashion in 10 years

1113
00:54:27,583 --> 00:54:29,119
Could have severe implications

1114
00:54:29,375 --> 00:54:30,143
For the General Public

1115
00:54:30,911 --> 00:54:35,519
I'm somewhat comforted by have ineffectual in an active Alex's audience seems to be but even so

1116
00:54:35,775 --> 00:54:36,799
This kind of rhetoric is

1117
00:54:37,055 --> 00:54:38,591
Completely unacceptable and

1118
00:54:38,847 --> 00:54:41,151
I think it's even a departure from the norm for how

1119
00:54:41,407 --> 00:54:42,175
Now that's crazy

1120
00:54:42,687 --> 00:54:47,295
Alex's introduced the idea that the global civil plan that has been tonti populate

1121
00:54:48,063 --> 00:54:52,671
He also introduced the idea to that the listeners of his show are as good as dead already

1122
00:54:53,183 --> 00:54:54,975
But I haven't really ever heard him do

1123
00:54:55,231 --> 00:54:55,999
Is what he's doing in the

1124
00:54:56,511 --> 00:54:58,047
Which is combining those two ideas

1125
00:54:58,559 --> 00:55:01,375
It would seem to be an appeal for people to force the government

1126
00:55:01,631 --> 00:55:02,143
Kill them

1127
00:55:02,399 --> 00:55:05,727
In order to accelerate the standoff he wants with his imaginary enemies

1128
00:55:06,495 --> 00:55:07,007
Annette's

1129
00:55:08,287 --> 00:55:09,823
I don't even have the word

1130
00:55:10,591 --> 00:55:11,103
It's horrifying

1131
00:55:11,359 --> 00:55:12,127
Yeah I mean

1132
00:55:12,383 --> 00:55:14,175
There's no there's not even like a

1133
00:55:15,199 --> 00:55:15,711
Zales

1134
00:55:16,223 --> 00:55:16,735
Politically

1135
00:55:16,991 --> 00:55:18,015
Or anything like that

1136
00:55:18,527 --> 00:55:19,807
Hey they're coming to murder you

1137
00:55:20,063 --> 00:55:23,903
You have the choice to sit there for 10 years and then die or you can fight

1138
00:55:24,159 --> 00:55:24,671
And Dino

1139
00:55:25,951 --> 00:55:28,255
So the only thing that you would think

1140
00:55:28,511 --> 00:55:31,071
If you were Lynn his audiences it's time to f******

1141
00:55:31,327 --> 00:55:32,095
Kill people

1142
00:55:32,351 --> 00:55:38,495
And two options are you can wait around and be killed in the orderly fashion in 10 years

1143
00:55:38,751 --> 00:55:40,799
Or you can do something to force

1144
00:55:41,055 --> 00:55:42,335
The globalist and out

1145
00:55:42,591 --> 00:55:47,967
How to do it now but we're all going to be dead no matter what it's almost like you don't you want to take them down with you

1146
00:55:48,223 --> 00:55:50,783
Exactly know like the billionaires are trying to escape

1147
00:55:51,039 --> 00:55:53,343
Can kill us all and then they'll be fighting what if

1148
00:55:53,599 --> 00:55:57,439
Hey at least we're going to take out 10 of them and you know who gets hurt by that

1149
00:55:57,695 --> 00:56:00,511
You and me not knowing me literally but everyone

1150
00:56:00,767 --> 00:56:01,279
Yep

1151
00:56:01,535 --> 00:56:05,119
Just people get hurt by that.

1152
00:56:05,375 --> 00:56:06,143
The real one

1153
00:56:06,399 --> 00:56:08,703
Yeah these like attacks on the Federal Building

1154
00:56:08,959 --> 00:56:10,239
And like the Oklahoma City bombing

1155
00:56:10,495 --> 00:56:12,031
Destroy the community

1156
00:56:13,823 --> 00:56:14,591
The community

1157
00:56:14,847 --> 00:56:15,359
People

1158
00:56:15,615 --> 00:56:16,127
People

1159
00:56:16,639 --> 00:56:17,151
It's not it

1160
00:56:18,687 --> 00:56:19,967
I'm not saying that that's what

1161
00:56:20,223 --> 00:56:23,039
What's going to happen but this kind of rhetoric leave them at Direction

1162
00:56:23,295 --> 00:56:24,063
I don't

1163
00:56:24,575 --> 00:56:25,599
I don't see how this

1164
00:56:26,111 --> 00:56:26,879
Kind of talk

1165
00:56:27,391 --> 00:56:29,695
Can possibly be directed towards

1166
00:56:30,719 --> 00:56:33,279
Awareness campaign

1167
00:56:33,535 --> 00:56:38,655
Let's get a little past I mean the reality the reality is after the 6

1168
00:56:38,911 --> 00:56:40,447
And nobody who was

1169
00:56:40,703 --> 00:56:41,215
At fault

1170
00:56:41,471 --> 00:56:41,983
For it

1171
00:56:42,239 --> 00:56:43,519
I took any

1172
00:56:44,287 --> 00:56:45,567
Punishment or

1173
00:56:46,591 --> 00:56:47,103
I mean

1174
00:56:47,359 --> 00:56:48,639
It doesn't even seem like people are

1175
00:56:48,895 --> 00:56:49,919
Anymore

1176
00:56:50,687 --> 00:56:51,967
Why wouldn't you keep doing this

1177
00:56:52,223 --> 00:56:57,343
I thought you didn't work last time but nobody's going to stop you from doing again I saw some pictures of the six

1178
00:56:58,367 --> 00:57:00,927
Again I seen some in a while I thought likewise

1179
00:57:01,439 --> 00:57:01,951
Holyshit

1180
00:57:03,231 --> 00:57:04,767
Even I have like

1181
00:57:05,279 --> 00:57:07,839
Do you settled into a place of like that happen

1182
00:57:08,351 --> 00:57:12,703
And some of the images that I had yeah I don't want to move

1183
00:57:12,959 --> 00:57:13,471
Godlike

1184
00:57:14,239 --> 00:57:17,823
Rihanna plastered over you no like

1185
00:57:18,079 --> 00:57:19,615
It didn't nothing happened

1186
00:57:19,871 --> 00:57:22,431
There's tons of people in Congress still

1187
00:57:22,687 --> 00:57:25,503
Can you imagine going to work everyday and like knowing

1188
00:57:25,759 --> 00:57:28,319
Through any kind of intelligence report that you have access

1189
00:57:29,343 --> 00:57:30,111
That guy

1190
00:57:30,367 --> 00:57:32,159
Across the f****** Hall from you

1191
00:57:32,415 --> 00:57:33,951
What's ready to murder you

1192
00:57:34,463 --> 00:57:36,511
Picture of how do you go to work like that

1193
00:57:36,767 --> 00:57:38,303
I will be tough

1194
00:57:38,559 --> 00:57:41,119
So Alex has it easy going to work cuz he just

1195
00:57:41,375 --> 00:57:42,399
Whatever the f*** you want

1196
00:57:42,911 --> 00:57:44,959
Doesn't matter and nobody's going to hold

1197
00:57:45,983 --> 00:57:46,751
We're going to be to Meijer

1198
00:57:48,031 --> 00:57:50,591
Dallas downtown

1199
00:57:51,615 --> 00:57:52,639
But I'm just telling you

1200
00:57:53,151 --> 00:57:55,199
I'm probably obviously not going to be there that's okay

1201
00:57:55,967 --> 00:57:58,015
Michael forcing instrumental

1202
00:57:59,295 --> 00:58:01,087
Pull punches

1203
00:58:02,111 --> 00:58:04,415
Cuz you know what's going to happen I'm not stupid you're not either

1204
00:58:05,439 --> 00:58:06,975
You know is all this happens

1205
00:58:07,487 --> 00:58:08,255
I'm going to go for

1206
00:58:11,071 --> 00:58:12,607
Allow me to be walking around very soon

1207
00:58:13,631 --> 00:58:14,399
But that's okay

1208
00:58:16,191 --> 00:58:20,031
Because I've lived a life of resistance and I can stand before God

1209
00:58:22,847 --> 00:58:24,127
I want to know you I do

1210
00:58:25,407 --> 00:58:25,919
I want to be

1211
00:58:26,943 --> 00:58:30,271
Alex is essentially like predicting his own like

1212
00:58:30,527 --> 00:58:31,551
Holy martyrdom

1213
00:58:32,319 --> 00:58:33,599
I am this is just

1214
00:58:34,111 --> 00:58:34,623
F****** mess

1215
00:58:34,879 --> 00:58:38,463
I will go from being trustworthy to being your secretary

1216
00:58:38,975 --> 00:58:41,279
Messiah all that I say will be

1217
00:58:41,535 --> 00:58:42,303
Be true

1218
00:58:42,559 --> 00:58:44,351
All that I say will be at

1219
00:58:44,607 --> 00:58:46,143
Accepted by the universe

1220
00:58:46,399 --> 00:58:47,679
As reality it's

1221
00:58:48,191 --> 00:58:54,335
I thought this was about the Federal Reserve man Federal Reserve

1222
00:58:54,591 --> 00:58:56,127
Like there's a grandiosity

1223
00:58:56,383 --> 00:58:58,943
On today's episode that we haven't seen quite theirs

1224
00:58:59,199 --> 00:59:01,503
This is intense very terrifying

1225
00:59:01,759 --> 00:59:02,783
And you know

1226
00:59:03,039 --> 00:59:04,575
He's Enemy Number One

1227
00:59:04,831 --> 00:59:07,135
If Infowars goes down that's

1228
00:59:07,391 --> 00:59:10,207
The canary in the coal mine where you really talk for a Merica

1229
00:59:10,463 --> 00:59:16,607
He's literally the f****** truth-telling Messiah now like this is delusion the Messiah but like a

1230
00:59:16,863 --> 00:59:17,375
John the

1231
00:59:17,631 --> 00:59:18,911
Just type it legal

1232
00:59:19,935 --> 00:59:22,495
Everything

1233
00:59:23,007 --> 00:59:26,591
I told you everything that's happened up until now here's before

1234
00:59:27,615 --> 00:59:28,383
Volume settings

1235
00:59:28,639 --> 00:59:30,175
Next time

1236
00:59:30,943 --> 00:59:32,991
Understand to tell you once this goes through

1237
00:59:33,759 --> 00:59:34,271
Your wife

1238
00:59:34,527 --> 00:59:35,551
Your children

1239
00:59:36,319 --> 00:59:36,831
Your dad

1240
00:59:39,903 --> 00:59:41,439
Explain how they've already done it

1241
00:59:44,767 --> 00:59:45,791
Which is why I did

1242
00:59:46,559 --> 00:59:48,095
Not going to let us organize against that

1243
00:59:49,375 --> 00:59:52,447
Figure out they're all dead

1244
00:59:55,519 --> 00:59:57,055
Almost

1245
00:59:57,311 --> 00:59:58,591
Almost every school teacher

1246
00:59:58,847 --> 01:00:03,199
Almost

1247
01:00:03,455 --> 01:00:05,247
They're coming to kill you

1248
01:00:05,503 --> 01:00:07,551
.

1249
01:00:08,063 --> 01:00:09,855
Human Slaughter

1250
01:00:10,111 --> 01:00:11,135
Warehouse

1251
01:00:21,119 --> 01:00:21,631
UK

1252
01:00:22,399 --> 01:00:23,423
Yeah this show man

1253
01:00:23,935 --> 01:00:24,703
That is a jackster

1254
01:00:24,959 --> 01:00:27,007
Deposition

1255
01:00:27,263 --> 01:00:32,383
Is Tim holiday listening I need a new phone

1256
01:00:35,711 --> 01:00:40,063
Understands the worship of capitalism but do they not see

1257
01:00:40,319 --> 01:00:40,831
How

1258
01:00:41,087 --> 01:00:42,623
F****** pirata kitties

1259
01:00:43,135 --> 01:00:43,647
To go from

1260
01:00:43,903 --> 01:00:44,927
You're all dead

1261
01:00:45,183 --> 01:00:45,951
All of you

1262
01:00:46,975 --> 01:00:50,047
Specifically

1263
01:00:50,303 --> 01:00:52,351
You're all dead if you need a new track

1264
01:00:52,607 --> 01:00:55,167
You're coming home I got week forklift

1265
01:00:55,423 --> 01:00:57,215
We can't do this

1266
01:01:01,567 --> 01:01:04,895
The real messaging of it is something that is so dangerous that

1267
01:01:05,151 --> 01:01:08,991
I can't I can't be dealt with as just like hahaha

1268
01:01:09,503 --> 01:01:12,575
In a fake reality looking a movie that kind of

1269
01:01:13,087 --> 01:01:15,135
Side-by-side is hilarious

1270
01:01:15,391 --> 01:01:17,183
Incredible

1271
01:01:17,695 --> 01:01:18,463
It's like

1272
01:01:18,719 --> 01:01:19,487
Cult leaders

1273
01:01:19,743 --> 01:01:25,887
Have to sell their Cults their own s*** you know they have to have their own books they have to have their own s*** their own

1274
01:01:26,143 --> 01:01:32,287
Forklift cult leader Latta goddamn Nike

1275
01:01:32,543 --> 01:01:35,615
What is a f****** Libras soccer player like he's got

1276
01:01:37,151 --> 01:01:38,175
No I mean it's not

1277
01:01:38,687 --> 01:01:39,967
It's not Stu Alex wants

1278
01:01:40,223 --> 01:01:40,991
He wants to get into

1279
01:01:41,247 --> 01:01:43,039
The intricacies of the plan right

1280
01:01:44,831 --> 01:01:46,623
Probably not

1281
01:01:47,135 --> 01:01:50,719
Master plan

1282
01:01:50,975 --> 01:01:52,255
The intricacies of this

1283
01:01:52,767 --> 01:01:55,583
So you understand that I'm not blowing smoke at you and I know you know that

1284
01:01:55,839 --> 01:01:56,351
I mean

1285
01:01:57,887 --> 01:01:59,423
I don't want to say these things

1286
01:01:59,679 --> 01:02:01,471
Hurt me really bad to say these things

1287
01:02:05,567 --> 01:02:07,103
I don't like myself

1288
01:02:08,127 --> 01:02:08,639
Something to you

1289
01:02:13,247 --> 01:02:14,271
Billions will die

1290
01:02:15,039 --> 01:02:17,343
Moves that one second closer on the clock

1291
01:02:17,599 --> 01:02:20,159
Ashley flowers

1292
01:02:22,975 --> 01:02:24,511
I don't enjoy

1293
01:02:24,767 --> 01:02:25,535
Messing with

1294
01:02:26,559 --> 01:02:27,583
But let me Translate

1295
01:02:28,095 --> 01:02:34,239
Putting out a headline that says a transparently desperate attempt

1296
01:02:34,495 --> 01:02:35,263
Nasionalisme cards left

1297
01:02:35,519 --> 01:02:36,031
Play

1298
01:02:36,543 --> 01:02:42,687
If his insistence that you do what he says now or billions will die doesn't move the needle how much louder can he possibly screw

1299
01:02:42,943 --> 01:02:43,711
The sky is falling

1300
01:02:44,479 --> 01:02:44,991
If I were him

1301
01:02:45,247 --> 01:02:47,039
I really wouldn't be too concerned about it

1302
01:02:47,295 --> 01:02:52,415
If there's one thing that the Infowars audience is good at it's being distracted by shiny new things to be afraid of

1303
01:02:52,927 --> 01:02:54,719
And I don't think it'll be that big of a

1304
01:02:55,743 --> 01:02:59,071
Did the swing that we're in right now is a pretty protracted

1305
01:02:59,327 --> 01:03:00,863
Pretty severe pretty long one

1306
01:03:01,119 --> 01:03:02,399
Terms of his career

1307
01:03:02,911 --> 01:03:03,935
Walking of this bag

1308
01:03:04,191 --> 01:03:04,703
Might be hard

1309
01:03:08,031 --> 01:03:09,567
If it brings them one second

1310
01:03:09,823 --> 01:03:10,847
Into taking him down

1311
01:03:11,615 --> 01:03:12,639
Every time he says that

1312
01:03:14,175 --> 01:03:15,199
He's got a lot of sex

1313
01:03:15,711 --> 01:03:20,831
He is got an insane amount of seconds over the past 27 years

1314
01:03:21,343 --> 01:03:22,623
I have not heard him

1315
01:03:22,879 --> 01:03:24,415
Not say that

1316
01:03:24,671 --> 01:03:28,511
They're ten years late to squash it

1317
01:03:32,351 --> 01:03:32,863
Jordan

1318
01:03:33,375 --> 01:03:34,143
I regret that it's gone

1319
01:03:34,399 --> 01:03:34,911
Come to this

1320
01:03:35,679 --> 01:03:36,191
But

1321
01:03:37,983 --> 01:03:38,751
Unfortunately

1322
01:03:39,263 --> 01:03:40,799
It's time to discuss the rainbow.

1323
01:03:41,055 --> 01:03:42,847
Dildo butt

1324
01:03:43,103 --> 01:03:44,383

With a fake

1329
01:04:03,583 --> 01:04:05,631
Butt naked with a fake vagina

1330
01:04:06,911 --> 01:04:07,423
Turkey gobbler

1331
01:04:07,679 --> 01:04:11,263
Fake woman's breast I wouldn't even show it on

1332
01:04:11,519 --> 01:04:13,055
Little kids came up

1333
01:04:20,991 --> 01:04:23,295
TV station

1334
01:04:24,575 --> 01:04:28,415
I regret to inform you that the time has come

1335
01:04:28,671 --> 01:04:29,183
To discuss

1336
01:04:29,439 --> 01:04:31,999
Rainbow dildo butt monkey

1337
01:04:32,511 --> 01:04:33,535
Don't want to live on

1338
01:04:33,791 --> 01:04:35,071
This planet

1339
01:04:35,327 --> 01:04:36,351
No rainbow

1340
01:04:36,607 --> 01:04:37,375
Dildo

1341
01:04:37,631 --> 01:04:38,143
But

1342
01:04:39,167 --> 01:04:45,311
Yeah I mean I was listening to this episode and I hear him saying some of the more dangerous extreme things that I've ever heard

1343
01:04:45,567 --> 01:04:48,895
Ferdinand a couple minutes later he's talking about a rainbow monkey

1344
01:04:49,151 --> 01:04:53,759
It really boccio business donkey wrestler it exact

1345
01:04:54,015 --> 01:05:00,159
Andre translate Coronavirus

1346
01:05:00,415 --> 01:05:02,719
What happened at goodmayes library in London

1347
01:05:02,975 --> 01:05:04,511
Which did appear to include what

1348
01:05:04,767 --> 01:05:06,815
You might unfortunately call a rainbow

1349
01:05:07,071 --> 01:05:07,583
Dildo

1350
01:05:09,887 --> 01:05:16,031
I am not an adult this is part found adults was part of a carnival act by it put on by a group

1351
01:05:16,287 --> 01:05:17,567
Called my dick goddard's

1352
01:05:17,823 --> 01:05:19,359
Monkey

1353
01:05:19,615 --> 01:05:23,199
Keep business where they some of the members dress up as brightly colored monkeys

1354
01:05:23,455 --> 01:05:23,967
Stikbots and

1355
01:05:24,479 --> 01:05:25,759
I regret to inform you faked

1356
01:05:26,271 --> 01:05:29,087
This appears to be a situation where this our group heading

1357
01:05:29,343 --> 01:05:33,183
Activated they got booked for a gig that maybe they should not have been booked for

1358
01:05:33,951 --> 01:05:40,095
The library's events are booked by a local charity called Vision RC L and it appears that's where the real break

1359
01:05:40,351 --> 01:05:41,119
Breakdown happened

1360
01:05:41,631 --> 01:05:45,727
They booked what could be argued as a reputable Arts group to do a performance for an event

1361
01:05:46,239 --> 01:05:48,287
And they showed up with some pretty f*****-up costumes

1362
01:05:48,543 --> 01:05:49,311
Is considered the audience

1363
01:05:50,335 --> 01:05:53,663
Everyone is up in arms about this and there is internal investigations open it

1364
01:05:53,919 --> 01:05:56,735
The how it ended up happening but suffice it to say that I

1365
01:05:56,991 --> 01:05:58,783
Completely fabricated version of the story

1366
01:05:59,039 --> 01:06:00,063
The outrage the audio

1367
01:06:00,319 --> 01:06:04,671
There's no indication that I can tell from any of the articles that I've read about this incident

1368
01:06:04,927 --> 01:06:06,719
Do the monkeys have contact with children

1369
01:06:06,975 --> 01:06:08,511
Let alone with Alex's describing

1370
01:06:09,023 --> 01:06:10,559
This is just as grotesque imagination

1371
01:06:10,815 --> 01:06:11,583
I'm trying to push the listener

1372
01:06:11,839 --> 01:06:13,887
Buttons we can override their rational Minds

1373
01:06:14,143 --> 01:06:15,935
And get them into a purely reactive state

1374
01:06:16,447 --> 01:06:22,591
Yeah that's a real bummer for them that really thought I mean I've been booked for I've been booked for a show before by somebody was like

1375
01:06:23,103 --> 01:06:27,711
Man you're really funny weary like if this is going to go great you're going to be great for the show and you get there

1376
01:06:27,967 --> 01:06:30,015
And then they're like Okay so

1377
01:06:30,271 --> 01:06:31,295
It's a church youth group

1378
01:06:31,551 --> 01:06:35,135
And you have to work clean and you got to do six and a half hour

1379
01:06:35,391 --> 01:06:37,183
Yeah I do like

1380
01:06:38,463 --> 01:06:38,975
No

1381
01:06:39,999 --> 01:06:42,047
No just no

1382
01:06:42,303 --> 01:06:48,447
There was one time that I don't know where it was but is always out of town is at least an hour away me and Nick Kroll

1383
01:06:48,959 --> 01:06:50,751
Comedian Nick Rowley got to book

1384
01:06:51,007 --> 01:06:52,287
4 gig neither of us very clean

1385
01:06:52,799 --> 01:06:58,943
Get me at all you're doing half an hour or you're doing 15

1386
01:06:59,199 --> 01:07:04,319
45 carbine

1387
01:07:05,343 --> 01:07:07,647
No no

1388
01:07:07,903 --> 01:07:08,671
So we were panicked

1389
01:07:08,927 --> 01:07:09,439
Family

1390
01:07:10,207 --> 01:07:13,535
What do we do until we I made a bet that I could talk about

1391
01:07:13,791 --> 01:07:14,303
The chicken finger

1392
01:07:14,815 --> 01:07:18,143
There were on the menu for the first 5 minutes

1393
01:07:19,423 --> 01:07:22,495
Peanut that's what, to have to do in those situations

1394
01:07:22,751 --> 01:07:26,847
All of every, cuz had that story where they're at a show and they're like well

1395
01:07:27,103 --> 01:07:33,247
We got to find a way to make this fun for us that's what's going to happen here cuz it's not going to be fun for that I was like Nick give me a light at 5

1396
01:07:36,319 --> 01:07:38,111
So I talked about everything I could think of about that

1397
01:07:38,367 --> 01:07:42,207
Chicken fingers

1398
01:07:43,231 --> 01:07:44,511
I was like I don't know

1399
01:07:44,767 --> 01:07:47,327
Start telling jokes I guess I can't do 50

1400
01:07:47,583 --> 01:07:48,863
And so like my first joke

1401
01:07:49,119 --> 01:07:50,655
It started with asking the audience

1402
01:07:50,911 --> 01:07:51,679
If they have jobs

1403
01:07:51,935 --> 01:07:52,959
Yeah and so like

1404
01:07:53,215 --> 01:07:55,775
I got job

1405
01:07:56,287 --> 01:08:01,663
Play what I eat those chicken fingers like it's about a job and then I Saw the Light

1406
01:08:02,687 --> 01:08:03,967
Nailed it

1407
01:08:04,223 --> 01:08:09,087
Clutch

1408
01:08:10,623 --> 01:08:12,159
Like identical Oppo

1409
01:08:12,415 --> 01:08:15,231
Blocking a alley-oop is right there at the buzzers

1410
01:08:15,487 --> 01:08:18,047
Kind of thing on a show you should not be booked

1411
01:08:18,303 --> 01:08:19,583
Another time

1412
01:08:19,839 --> 01:08:21,119
When I first moved to the city

1413
01:08:21,375 --> 01:08:22,143
I was trying to find

1414
01:08:22,399 --> 01:08:23,679
Gigs on like Craigslist

1415
01:08:24,191 --> 01:08:30,079
Oh yeah yeah back Squad anything any kind of stage time I sound

1416
01:08:30,591 --> 01:08:32,639
Who did a show that was at like an art gallery

1417
01:08:33,151 --> 01:08:34,687
And so I went and I did the show.

1418
01:08:34,943 --> 01:08:35,967
It's kind of funny another is

1419
01:08:36,223 --> 01:08:38,527
McNeil not too many people there but he was in

1420
01:08:38,783 --> 01:08:39,295
A little art

1421
01:08:39,551 --> 01:08:40,319
Installation

1422
01:08:41,343 --> 01:08:43,391
Bambino no microphones do nothing

1423
01:08:43,647 --> 01:08:44,671
Is a good time

1424
01:08:45,439 --> 01:08:47,487
This person booked me for another

1425
01:08:47,999 --> 01:08:48,511
Thing

1426
01:08:48,767 --> 01:08:50,559
And I showed up to it

1427
01:08:51,071 --> 01:08:51,583
And like

1428
01:08:52,351 --> 01:08:53,375
It was all kid

1429
01:08:54,143 --> 01:09:00,287
It was like no it was like at a kids art fair

1430
01:09:01,567 --> 01:09:04,639
There's literally no way I'm going up on stage didn't agree

1431
01:09:05,151 --> 01:09:06,687
Any jokes there's just no way

1432
01:09:06,943 --> 01:09:07,967
I think it might be a crime

1433
01:09:09,247 --> 01:09:11,295
It might be a time so I had to work out like some

1434
01:09:11,551 --> 01:09:16,927
Some sort of a bit where I would panic and run off stage

1435
01:09:17,183 --> 01:09:18,975
These kids don't know what's funny how they got.

1436
01:09:20,511 --> 01:09:21,791
I feel like

1437
01:09:22,303 --> 01:09:23,839
Maybe there should have been

1438
01:09:24,095 --> 01:09:24,863
And some kind of an audible

1439
01:09:25,119 --> 01:09:26,143
Foucault in terms of

1440
01:09:27,167 --> 01:09:28,447
Rainbow dildo butt monkey

1441
01:09:31,775 --> 01:09:33,055
But unfortunately

1442
01:09:33,311 --> 01:09:35,359
That's what that so many. Like that

1443
01:09:35,615 --> 01:09:41,759
The booker like it has so many times that you know I've done a college show before where the booker is like so

1444
01:09:42,015 --> 01:09:43,551
Some nineteen-year-old kid they're like

1445
01:09:43,807 --> 01:09:45,343
We're so excited we got like

1446
01:09:47,647 --> 01:09:50,463
This is so cool and then you get into like I've nowhere

1447
01:09:51,487 --> 01:09:53,791
Can cafeteria without a micro anything in there like

1448
01:09:54,047 --> 01:09:58,655
Okay hear all the things that the school says you're not allowed to talk about any like you could have

1449
01:09:58,911 --> 01:09:59,423
Set me an

1450
01:09:59,679 --> 01:10:00,959
Email and I would have said

1451
01:10:01,215 --> 01:10:05,311
No organized and there's often times miscommunication

1452
01:10:05,567 --> 01:10:06,079
What happened

1453
01:10:06,335 --> 01:10:09,919
Between parties and easily see this being something along those lines

1454
01:10:11,455 --> 01:10:17,599
I don't know I do agree on the most basic level the discussion was

1455
01:10:20,415 --> 01:10:22,719
I don't think it has anything to do with the

1456
01:10:23,231 --> 01:10:25,279
The devil

1457
01:10:25,535 --> 01:10:27,071
Think nope nope

1458
01:10:27,327 --> 01:10:28,351
But this but

1459
01:10:28,863 --> 01:10:29,887
He also tells

1460
01:10:30,399 --> 01:10:30,911
A story

1461
01:10:32,191 --> 01:10:33,727
And this story I actually found really fast

1462
01:10:35,007 --> 01:10:36,031
It's real folks

1463
01:10:37,055 --> 01:10:37,823
It's one thing

1464
01:10:38,079 --> 01:10:39,615
To be knowing it's coming

1465
01:10:42,431 --> 01:10:48,319
Slow motion

1466
01:10:48,831 --> 01:10:51,135
I thought Corvette driving on a 25 miles an hour

1467
01:10:52,415 --> 01:10:53,951
Race on Highway

1468
01:10:55,231 --> 01:10:56,767
Wait what

1469
01:10:57,535 --> 01:10:58,303
Explode

1470
01:10:58,815 --> 01:10:59,327
People's head

1471
01:11:00,351 --> 01:11:02,143
Got caught off one person Farm Parkway

1472
01:11:03,935 --> 01:11:05,215
Botana pulled over the truck

1473
01:11:05,471 --> 01:11:06,751
Second chapter

1474
01:11:07,263 --> 01:11:08,031
I'm watching

1475
01:11:09,567 --> 01:11:10,335
The Bible trying to get up

1476
01:11:13,919 --> 01:11:15,711
The body was flat so personal

1477
01:11:23,135 --> 01:11:23,903
We were in a truck

1478
01:11:26,719 --> 01:11:29,279
15

1479
01:11:31,583 --> 01:11:34,655
Nobody saying I'm not speeding 120

1480
01:11:36,959 --> 01:11:39,519
By the time that take blue out and then

1481
01:11:39,775 --> 01:11:41,055
Fine and all that happened

1482
01:11:42,079 --> 01:11:45,407
By the time that happened we pulled up it was just instantaneous and I get out of the car

1483
01:11:45,919 --> 01:11:48,223
Flipped over onto the railroad trestle

1484
01:11:49,247 --> 01:11:49,759
Right there

1485
01:11:52,319 --> 01:11:52,831
Can I watch that

1486
01:11:54,367 --> 01:11:56,927
Slow motion that Corvette spinning

1487
01:11:57,695 --> 01:11:58,975
Watching those bodies fly

1488
01:12:00,255 --> 01:12:03,327
Slow motion I really just killed twenty million people

1489
01:12:03,839 --> 01:12:05,887
This seems like the kind of story that would make it

1490
01:12:06,143 --> 01:12:06,655
The news

1491
01:12:07,167 --> 01:12:07,679
You know

1492
01:12:08,447 --> 01:12:12,287
See if I can find any instances of drag race related deaths of Youth

1493
01:12:12,799 --> 01:12:13,311
In Corvette

1494
01:12:13,567 --> 01:12:14,591
Trim around the ears when Alex

1495
01:12:14,847 --> 01:12:16,127
Would have been the right age

1496
01:12:16,383 --> 01:12:17,151
But he's describing

1497
01:12:17,663 --> 01:12:20,479
I was born in 1974 so I looked at cases like

1498
01:12:20,735 --> 01:12:21,247
Flying from

1499
01:12:21,759 --> 01:12:23,551
Between 1988 and 1990

1500
01:12:24,319 --> 01:12:29,951
The first case that came up was an 18 year old named Chris Taylor who live in the suburb of Dallas so right near Rockwall

1501
01:12:30,207 --> 01:12:30,975
In the area

1502
01:12:31,231 --> 01:12:34,559
In died in a drag racing accident while driving the Corvette in what's the

1503
01:12:34,815 --> 01:12:36,351
Described as a quote fiery crash

1504
01:12:37,119 --> 01:12:39,679
This was on the night of Christmas 1989

1505
01:12:39,935 --> 01:12:41,727
Certainly in the wheel ballpark

1506
01:12:41,983 --> 01:12:48,127
If this is who Alex's talking about the nice one with a wild since Chris's mother is currently in prison for hiring

1507
01:12:48,383 --> 01:12:50,431
The guy that killed woman who was sleeping with her estranged husband

1508
01:12:51,711 --> 01:12:52,735
It's a it's a pretty

1509
01:12:52,991 --> 01:12:53,759
Big murder case

1510
01:12:54,015 --> 01:12:54,783
Alright alright

1511
01:12:55,295 --> 01:12:58,879
This is actually the only case that I could find it fit the details that Alex

1512
01:12:59,135 --> 01:13:00,159
Describing

1513
01:13:00,415 --> 01:13:01,183
Actually proved that it

1514
01:13:01,439 --> 01:13:02,207
It's the one he is talking

1515
01:13:02,975 --> 01:13:03,999
Whatever the case is

1516
01:13:04,255 --> 01:13:05,791
He's either making this story up or

1517
01:13:06,047 --> 01:13:09,631
Describing a life experience that would leave such deep scars in a person that they would

1518
01:13:09,887 --> 01:13:10,911
Tons of therapy

1519
01:13:11,167 --> 01:13:12,959
10 years of work to process what they've been

1520
01:13:13,215 --> 01:13:13,727
Been through

1521
01:13:13,983 --> 01:13:16,031
Seeing anyone die as a team is an immense

1522
01:13:16,287 --> 01:13:19,871
Trauma but seeing a friend die in a grisly fashion like what Alex describe

1523
01:13:20,383 --> 01:13:21,919
I will be so hard to deal with

1524
01:13:22,175 --> 01:13:23,711
Even with appropriate helping

1525
01:13:23,967 --> 01:13:24,479
Kerr Lake

1526
01:13:27,551 --> 01:13:29,599
The imprint of that would be

1527
01:13:29,855 --> 01:13:30,879
Almost unfathomable

1528
01:13:31,135 --> 01:13:31,903
Not too

1529
01:13:32,159 --> 01:13:32,671
You know like

1530
01:13:33,183 --> 01:13:34,975
Of course there's the bias I have because we

1531
01:13:35,231 --> 01:13:35,743
We're dealing with Al

1532
01:13:36,511 --> 01:13:40,095
But if anybody told me that story The Way Alex told me that story

1533
01:13:40,607 --> 01:13:42,911
That sounds like you stole somebody else

1534
01:13:43,935 --> 01:13:44,447
That's not

1535
01:13:44,703 --> 01:13:46,751
Yours I'm not saying that that's there was

1536
01:13:47,007 --> 01:13:51,871
True there was a flatness to the way he's delivering it doesn't feel emotionally resonant

1537
01:13:52,127 --> 01:13:54,687
It's somebody else's story it's one of those situations where you

1538
01:13:54,943 --> 01:13:57,503
You've seen that before where somebody I don't know if you've

1539
01:13:57,759 --> 01:13:59,039
Bentonite experience

1540
01:13:59,295 --> 01:14:01,343
Get caught with it but you've been in that

1541
01:14:01,599 --> 01:14:02,367
Situation where you been

1542
01:14:03,135 --> 01:14:05,951
Wow that's a really good story and then later on somebody's like you know that's not

1543
01:14:06,975 --> 01:14:07,487
That's not his story

1544
01:14:08,511 --> 01:14:12,351
It's possible that would explain it or just a complete detachment

1545
01:14:12,607 --> 01:14:14,399
From emotions that he was

1546
01:14:14,655 --> 01:14:15,679
Experience time

1547
01:14:16,959 --> 01:14:19,007
Completely made up I'm not entirely sure but

1548
01:14:19,263 --> 01:14:19,775
Like

1549
01:14:20,031 --> 01:14:21,055
My pictures now that's just

1550
01:14:21,311 --> 01:14:22,591
That's why

1551
01:14:22,847 --> 01:14:23,615
Yeah

1552
01:14:24,639 --> 01:14:25,151
Brutal

1553
01:14:26,687 --> 01:14:28,223
Alex gets into a weird head

1554
01:14:29,503 --> 01:14:31,295
Really just killed twenty million

1555
01:14:32,575 --> 01:14:35,391
All the Facebook workers all the Twitter workers

1556
01:14:35,647 --> 01:14:36,927
All the YouTube workers

1557
01:14:37,183 --> 01:14:37,695
All of you

1558
01:14:38,463 --> 01:14:39,231
That that block

1559
01:14:39,487 --> 01:14:43,583
Hydroxychloroquine

1560
01:14:43,839 --> 01:14:46,655
Can you help murder the 20-something millionaires starve to death

1561
01:14:47,423 --> 01:14:48,959
On top of all the other dead people

1562
01:14:51,263 --> 01:14:51,775
You did that

1563
01:14:56,127 --> 01:14:56,639
You don't even care

1564
01:14:57,663 --> 01:14:58,943
Modern Warfare

1565
01:15:00,991 --> 01:15:07,135
Turn the economy off and all you got to do work at Big Tex about it

1566
01:15:08,415 --> 01:15:11,743
Call me a racist what the hell does that even mean

1567
01:15:18,143 --> 01:15:18,655
And

1568
01:15:21,471 --> 01:15:21,983
Time off

1569
01:15:26,847 --> 01:15:28,383
I almost feel like my mission is complete

1570
01:15:28,895 --> 01:15:30,431
I really do feel like

1571
01:15:30,943 --> 01:15:31,711
We're here now

1572
01:15:32,735 --> 01:15:34,271
And if people don't do anything about it

1573
01:15:36,063 --> 01:15:38,111
Don't want to keep working I don't want

1574
01:15:43,487 --> 01:15:44,511
Why do I have to go find

1575
01:15:45,535 --> 01:15:46,559
The Politico article

1576
01:15:50,655 --> 01:15:52,191
Why

1577
01:15:52,447 --> 01:15:55,263
Cuz it's your f****** job

1578
01:15:57,823 --> 01:16:03,967
Why do I have to go do this what do I have

1579
01:16:04,223 --> 01:16:06,783
Have to provide information in the information

1580
01:16:08,831 --> 01:16:09,599
Wow

1581
01:16:09,855 --> 01:16:10,367
Wow

1582
01:16:10,623 --> 01:16:12,415
That's a guy does not give a f***

1583
01:16:12,671 --> 01:16:15,487
That's a meltdown on stage right there that's

1584
01:16:15,743 --> 01:16:17,535
Spencer me standing out there just being like

1585
01:16:17,791 --> 01:16:21,631
Why do I have to tell you people jokes you guys can tell each other jokes

1586
01:16:22,143 --> 01:16:24,191
I've had moments

1587
01:16:24,959 --> 01:16:26,239
Dark moments where I thought

1588
01:16:26,495 --> 01:16:32,639
This is so stupid that I'm chasing down this thread that Alex is talking about why do I have to read this thing or whatever

1589
01:16:32,895 --> 01:16:34,687
Never once have I been like

1590
01:16:35,199 --> 01:16:41,087
Why does it fall to me through the thing I've decided to do

1591
01:16:41,343 --> 01:16:43,647
Frustrating sometimes but

1592
01:16:43,903 --> 01:16:48,255
He's not just your job either it's your entire creation

1593
01:16:48,767 --> 01:16:51,327
18 Euro Pizza uniform vision

1594
01:16:51,839 --> 01:16:53,119
Created by one man

1595
01:16:53,631 --> 01:16:55,679
Who is now bitching about why he has

1596
01:16:55,935 --> 01:16:56,959
To do it

1597
01:16:57,215 --> 01:17:02,847
Whatever I do think there's something to be said for like the idea that his mission is done and when I hear that I think like

1598
01:17:03,615 --> 01:17:08,479
This is kind of him just recognizing that there's nowhere else he can take inside

1599
01:17:08,991 --> 01:17:12,831
He's I mean he's yeah he's already saying that it's millions are going to down to reach

1600
01:17:13,087 --> 01:17:16,927
The point where it's like people aren't shooting now I can't do anything else

1601
01:17:17,439 --> 01:17:18,463
Without getting myself in

1602
01:17:18,975 --> 01:17:19,487
Actually

1603
01:17:19,743 --> 01:17:21,023
Legal prison trouble

1604
01:17:22,047 --> 01:17:23,071

Who's the movie Criminal

1606
01:17:24,351 --> 01:17:25,887
I helped kick the 6th off

1607
01:17:26,143 --> 01:17:28,191
Nobody got into any trouble

1608
01:17:28,447 --> 01:17:31,775
So I'm going to try and kick off the next one and if it doesn't happen

1609
01:17:32,287 --> 01:17:36,127
It doesn't happen more articles and political exactly exactly

1610
01:17:36,383 --> 01:17:42,015
Play I want the second one to happen I'm going to try and make it happen and if it doesn't then that's my mission

1611
01:17:42,271 --> 01:17:42,783
Yeah

01:18:59,327 --> 01:19:00,095
Acquiesce

1633
01:19:00,607 --> 01:19:02,399
We open the gates of hell

1634
01:19:06,495 --> 01:19:07,519
We're all going to die

1635
01:19:08,543 --> 01:19:09,567
Holyshit

1636
01:19:10,847 --> 01:19:11,871
I don't

1637
01:19:19,039 --> 01:19:20,831
Verizon

1638
01:19:21,087 --> 01:19:25,695
I got is the same speech from Event Horizon rainbow dildo but monkey wants

1639
01:19:25,951 --> 01:19:27,231
What's the tear you limb from limb

1640
01:19:27,487 --> 01:19:28,255
I think

1641
01:19:28,767 --> 01:19:32,095
It's a carnival Act was poorly book

1642
01:19:33,375 --> 01:19:34,911
I don't understand

1643
01:19:35,423 --> 01:19:36,703
The level of

1644
01:19:36,959 --> 01:19:37,727
Douchebag

1645
01:19:37,983 --> 01:19:39,775
And why me like

1646
01:19:40,031 --> 01:19:43,871
Oversensitive lunatic you have to be to not immediately laugh

1647
01:19:44,383 --> 01:19:45,151
At Rainbow

1648
01:19:45,663 --> 01:19:46,431
Fildo

1649
01:19:46,687 --> 01:19:47,199
Butt monkey

1650
01:19:51,039 --> 01:19:51,807
Would be like listen

1651
01:19:53,855 --> 01:19:54,367
I'm sorry

1652
01:19:59,231 --> 01:20:05,375
Me and Luke Skywalker can agree on that. I'm not talking about the Star Wars character I'm talking about Uncle Luke

1653
01:20:06,143 --> 01:20:12,287
Fuckingawesome if I do from 2 Live Crew tried to call himself Luke Skywalker

1654
01:20:14,336 --> 01:20:20,224
Swig of a sabre with that one but

1655
01:20:21,248 --> 01:20:23,040
Luke Skywalker

1656
01:20:23,552 --> 01:20:24,064
Awesome

1657
01:20:25,344 --> 01:20:27,136
Yeah also I was waiting for Alex to drink

1658
01:20:27,392 --> 01:20:29,440
Completos with drag queen story time

1659
01:20:29,696 --> 01:20:32,000
It took him this long

1660
01:20:32,256 --> 01:20:33,280
This event had nothing

1661
01:20:33,536 --> 01:20:35,328
To do with even that at all it's

1662
01:20:35,584 --> 01:20:36,096
Sissies

1663
01:20:36,608 --> 01:20:37,376
He's just trying to get

1664
01:20:37,632 --> 01:20:38,400
Getting weary camp

1665
01:20:39,168 --> 01:20:42,240
Anybody dress differently around kids is annex

1666
01:20:42,496 --> 01:20:44,032
Excuse for me to call somebody a pedophile

1667
01:20:44,288 --> 01:20:44,800
File

1668
01:20:56,832 --> 01:20:57,344
At 1

1669
01:20:57,600 --> 01:20:59,648
See now that's a Nicolas Cage

1670
01:21:00,160 --> 01:21:00,928
Right there

1671
01:21:01,184 --> 01:21:01,696
Yes sir

1672
01:21:01,952 --> 01:21:02,464
Star Wars

1673
01:21:02,720 --> 01:21:03,488
Luke Skywalker

1674
01:21:03,744 --> 01:21:04,256
Scientific

1675
01:21:05,024 --> 01:21:06,048
What's your favorite science which

1676
01:21:06,304 --> 01:21:06,816
TV show

1677
01:21:07,328 --> 01:21:10,656
My favorite science fiction TV show that's a good question

1678
01:21:10,912 --> 01:21:13,472
You know you could you could say something classic like

1679
01:21:13,728 --> 01:21:15,776
Firefly you can do one of those

1680
01:21:16,032 --> 01:21:18,848
You know but I don't think I'm going to do that

1681
01:21:19,616 --> 01:21:25,760
You could go with one of the early you know one of the newer stuff like Mandalorian mandalorians great Mandalorian

1682
01:21:26,016 --> 01:21:30,624
Just because Luke Skywalker does show up spoiler

1683
01:21:30,880 --> 01:21:33,440
I have not yet watch the Mandalorian too much Survivor

1684
01:21:34,720 --> 01:21:35,744
Eventually

1685
01:21:36,256 --> 01:21:38,304
The survival or buying

1686
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:39,584
He's probably The X-Files

1687
01:21:39,840 --> 01:21:43,936
I have a lot of fond memories of watching that with my parents

1688
01:21:44,448 --> 01:21:45,472
Ma

1689
01:21:45,728 --> 01:21:51,872
The dude's very long video essay on YouTube

1690
01:21:52,128 --> 01:21:58,272
Try to convince me that the Act was bad sour-faced

1691
01:21:58,528 --> 01:22:01,600
I've made peace with it but yeah I was convinced

1692
01:22:01,856 --> 01:22:03,904
This Is the End

1693
01:22:05,184 --> 01:22:07,232
Gloss for what it was

1694
01:22:07,488 --> 01:22:08,512
Watch The X-Files

1695
01:22:08,768 --> 01:22:09,280
Was growing up at

1696
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:11,584
Star Trek the Next Generation

1697
01:22:14,656 --> 01:22:15,680
Terrified of The X-Files

1698
01:22:16,960 --> 01:22:17,472
It seems like

1699
01:22:17,728 --> 01:22:18,240
It could happen

1700
01:22:18,752 --> 01:22:21,056
Like a lot of the stuff could happen and people are getting

1701
01:22:21,312 --> 01:22:25,152
Hurt by things smoking cigarettes

1702
01:22:28,224 --> 01:22:32,064
Could show up deaf underground all the time I always took solace in like

1703
01:22:32,576 --> 01:22:33,600
It almost never happens

1704
01:22:34,112 --> 01:22:34,624
To a kid

1705
01:22:34,880 --> 01:22:35,648
I'm a kid

1706
01:22:35,904 --> 01:22:36,928
True like

1707
01:22:37,184 --> 01:22:39,744
SafeLink

1708
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:46,144
Set up a little bit

1709
01:22:46,656 --> 01:22:47,168
Anyway

1710
01:22:47,424 --> 01:22:48,960
Maxwell's was created by Chris Carter

1711
01:22:49,216 --> 01:22:52,032
Alex and

1712
01:22:55,360 --> 01:22:56,128
Chris Carter

1713
01:22:56,640 --> 01:22:57,408
Isn't Western

1714
01:22:58,176 --> 01:23:00,480
And Chris Carter said some nice things about us we talked to Christopher

1715
01:23:02,272 --> 01:23:05,600
And the Chris admitted the CIA came to him and told him what to say

1716
01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:08,160
Episode

1717
01:23:09,952 --> 01:23:12,256
Wasn't sure why he was asking me why

1718
01:23:13,536 --> 01:23:15,584
But it's inside predictive programming

1719
01:23:16,608 --> 01:23:18,656
Injection with Spike protein

1720
01:23:20,192 --> 01:23:22,240
What is the destroy people's immune systems

1721
01:23:23,008 --> 01:23:25,056
And slowly kill them with a soft kill weapon

1722
01:23:26,336 --> 01:23:27,616
TI-84

1723
01:23:27,872 --> 01:23:28,896
November 11th

1724
01:23:34,784 --> 01:23:35,552
Why did they do it

1725
01:23:35,808 --> 01:23:36,320
For now

1726
01:23:37,344 --> 01:23:40,672
This is just Alex wrinkling the same day I'm seeing it there

1727
01:23:40,928 --> 01:23:42,464
I've seen it in my mind's eye

1728
01:23:43,744 --> 01:23:45,792
Why was the CIA want that out then

1729
01:23:52,448 --> 01:23:53,216
27 years later

1730
01:24:10,624 --> 01:24:11,648
Because there's

1731
01:24:11,904 --> 01:24:12,416
Accrual

1732
01:24:14,464 --> 01:24:15,488
They got a post

1733
01:24:16,512 --> 01:24:17,792
In the newspaper

1734
01:24:18,304 --> 01:24:19,328
Turn on TV

1735
01:24:21,120 --> 01:24:22,144
Right on the wall

1736
01:24:22,656 --> 01:24:24,960
What about before writing

1737
01:24:25,728 --> 01:24:28,544
What's going to be done so you got a chance to change your future

1738
01:24:34,688 --> 01:24:36,992
You got a free here longer than a local law

1739
01:24:37,248 --> 01:24:38,784
Run an ad every month

1740
01:24:42,880 --> 01:24:43,648
Guide

1741
01:24:44,160 --> 01:24:50,304
So save it like if this was something it was you no revealed and X-Files episode in 1994 you

1742
01:24:50,560 --> 01:24:56,704
You guys drop the ball on warning I did a really bad job

1743
01:24:56,960 --> 01:25:00,288
Seems like

1744
01:25:00,544 --> 01:25:03,360
Plot from an X-Files episode of there were hundreds

1745
01:25:03,616 --> 01:25:08,736
I bet you could have even gone to the Twilight Zone for a plot very similar to that

1746
01:25:08,992 --> 01:25:10,528
Chris Carter didn't say things out with the same

1747
01:25:11,040 --> 01:25:17,184
This didn't even have to do with the X-Files it's it was a claim that is made by Dean haglund one of these stars of The X-Files

1748
01:25:17,440 --> 01:25:18,208
Turn off the lone gunmen

1749
01:25:18,976 --> 01:25:25,120
Pilot episode of that show involve elements that were somewhat similar to the events of 9/11 but

1750
01:25:25,376 --> 01:25:25,888
911

1751
01:25:26,144 --> 01:25:31,264
And haggling to use this to make a bit of a foray into the 9/11 conspiracy world are heavily implying that the

1752
01:25:31,520 --> 01:25:32,544
The powers that be injected

1753
01:25:32,800 --> 01:25:33,568
Blocks into their show

1754
01:25:34,336 --> 01:25:35,872
None of this necessarily prove anything

1755
01:25:36,384 --> 01:25:38,688
Also with the globalist really felt like I needed to make a pub

1756
01:25:38,944 --> 01:25:39,712
Good post of their plan

1757
01:25:39,968 --> 01:25:42,016
Why do they choose to do it in the spin-off show

1758
01:25:42,528 --> 01:25:45,344
More people see it if they did it on the X-Files like

1759
01:25:45,600 --> 01:25:48,928
If it satisfies The Intergalactic law to put some predictive programming on

1760
01:25:49,184 --> 01:25:51,232
Pilots of spin-off shows that

1761
01:25:51,488 --> 01:25:54,560
This dude is an episode of some dogshit showed no one watches on the depth

1762
01:25:55,072 --> 01:25:58,400
Deep cable is there a ratings

1763
01:25:58,656 --> 01:25:59,168
Limit

1764
01:25:59,424 --> 01:26:00,960
In this Galactic rule

1765
01:26:01,216 --> 01:26:04,288
I mean this is something I would like to actually discuss because like

1766
01:26:05,056 --> 01:26:08,128
You know this thing in The Hitchhiker's Guide is like

1767
01:26:08,384 --> 01:26:10,432
They have the the post of

1768
01:26:10,688 --> 01:26:11,456
The destruction of Earth

1769
01:26:11,712 --> 01:26:17,856
Yeah they could somewhere we would never see it to go into the office building you have to go down three

1770
01:26:18,112 --> 01:26:19,904
Flights of stairs and it was play with last week

1771
01:26:20,160 --> 01:26:25,024
It was posted yeah you could have gone there at any time it's your own fault right so like why couldn't

1772
01:26:25,280 --> 01:26:27,840
They reveal that 9/11 was going to happen until like

1773
01:26:28,352 --> 01:26:29,120
What Aunt like

1774
01:26:29,376 --> 01:26:31,936
What's up telenovela that no one watches in

1775
01:26:32,192 --> 01:26:32,960
In Spanish

1776
01:26:37,056 --> 01:26:38,592
I don't know it's

1777
01:26:38,848 --> 01:26:39,616
It seems bizarre

1778
01:26:39,872 --> 01:26:44,224
Also after learning as much as I can about this Haiti situation

1779
01:26:44,736 --> 01:26:45,760
I think the CIA

1780
01:26:46,016 --> 01:26:47,040
Is 100% used

1781
01:26:47,296 --> 01:26:51,136
Because it appears that some random doctor in Florida can just hire a hit

1782
01:26:51,392 --> 01:26:54,208
A-Team and then successfully murder a president

1783
01:26:54,464 --> 01:26:55,744
Wow CIA is useless

1784
01:26:56,512 --> 01:26:57,024
Huh

1785
01:26:57,536 --> 01:27:03,680
I need to dig into that story a little bit more

1786
01:27:03,936 --> 01:27:05,728
Alex on this episode about it

1787
01:27:06,240 --> 01:27:10,080
There are some similarities between the plot of that episode of The Lone gunmen

1788
01:27:10,336 --> 01:27:14,688
And the events of 9/11 are also major differences that are just ignored but Alex

1789
01:27:15,200 --> 01:27:18,528
Into the show the attack is a single airplane and its remote

1790
01:27:18,784 --> 01:27:19,296
Controlled

1791
01:27:19,552 --> 01:27:20,832
Lone gunmen a game

1792
01:27:21,088 --> 01:27:25,440
In control of the remote control plane and save the day which they do would shouldn't happen to the real world

1793
01:27:25,696 --> 01:27:31,072
Also there's a whole subplot about a powerful computer chip and whether or not the lone gunmen Zena's any good

1794
01:27:34,400 --> 01:27:40,544
Hey I like the younger I thought they were pretty cool

1795
01:27:41,056 --> 01:27:42,336
Back when I was

1796
01:27:42,592 --> 01:27:43,360
Watching The X-Files

1797
01:27:43,616 --> 01:27:44,128
Deliver those

1798
01:27:44,384 --> 01:27:48,480
The side characters level

1799
01:27:48,736 --> 01:27:53,344
I just never ate missed me by I think cuz my parents were so like

1800
01:27:53,600 --> 01:27:57,184
Now we can't be having this time 3 conspiracy theorist

1801
01:27:57,440 --> 01:28:00,512
Sewer friends with Mulder like publish a zine

1802
01:28:00,768 --> 01:28:06,912
And secretly in on a whole bunch of comic relief

1803
01:28:07,936 --> 01:28:14,080
Put the elements of the show that are similar to the events that happened in the real world later actually not too surprising if you think about it

1804
01:28:14,592 --> 01:28:18,176
There's been a previous attack on the World Trade Center so that wasn't completely unheard of

1805
01:28:18,432 --> 01:28:24,320
The idea of staging such an attack in order to boost weapons sales that's a well-conceived plot which makes sense

1806
01:28:24,576 --> 01:28:27,904
Considering the Chris Carter and the future creator of Breaking Bad Vince

1807
01:28:28,160 --> 01:28:29,440
Gilligan wrote the episode

1808
01:28:30,208 --> 01:28:32,000
Also I need to get out in front of this

1809
01:28:32,256 --> 01:28:34,816
Just in case there's any kind of f****** s***

1810
01:28:35,328 --> 01:28:41,472
Fourth episode of the lone gunman was written by someone named Colin freezing and as far as I know I don't have any relatives named Colin

1811
01:28:41,728 --> 01:28:44,544
It is spelled the same I don't know Collin Friesen

1812
01:28:44,800 --> 01:28:45,312
Okay

1813
01:28:45,824 --> 01:28:47,104
The episode of The X-Files Metallica

1814
01:28:47,360 --> 01:28:50,176
Who's pretending was about the covid vaccine is titled one breath

1815
01:28:50,432 --> 01:28:51,456
Episode number 8

1816
01:28:51,712 --> 01:28:52,480
Season 2

1817
01:28:52,992 --> 01:28:57,856
Essentially scully's hospitalized in Boulder and list the lone gunmen to help him figure out what's up

1818
01:28:58,368 --> 01:29:01,184
They get her medical charts and find there's a protein chains

1819
01:29:01,440 --> 01:29:04,768
That appear to have been part of an experimental tracking system but they're inactive

1820
01:29:05,024 --> 01:29:06,048
So they've become toxic

1821
01:29:06,304 --> 01:29:06,816
Inside her

1822
01:29:07,328 --> 01:29:08,352
He doesn't die in

1823
01:29:08,608 --> 01:29:09,632
It's not a soft kill weapon

1824
01:29:09,888 --> 01:29:10,656
I was just cherry-picking

1825
01:29:10,912 --> 01:29:13,728
Details from pop culture shows the impression that he wants

1826
01:29:13,984 --> 01:29:14,752
But it's all bulshit

1827
01:29:15,008 --> 01:29:15,520
Also

1828
01:29:15,776 --> 01:29:21,920
He's creating a very inaccurate perception that the lone gunmen were basically the stars of the Xbox

1829
01:29:22,432 --> 01:29:22,944
That's not good

1830
01:29:23,200 --> 01:29:28,064
Scary characters that many episodes

1831
01:29:28,320 --> 01:29:28,832
Sure

1832
01:29:29,344 --> 01:29:30,880
Sting at they got guest starring credit

1833
01:29:31,136 --> 01:29:37,280
That's in the Yeah Yeah Yeahs

1834
01:29:37,536 --> 01:29:40,864
And at the end

1835
01:29:41,376 --> 01:29:45,728
He like I remember his name I don't remember the other two guys who are the lone gunmen

1836
01:29:45,984 --> 01:29:48,032
I think I like the other guys better probably

1837
01:29:48,288 --> 01:29:54,432
Yeah seen haglund is a very memorable name

1838
01:29:55,712 --> 01:29:56,992
He was the one who had like

1839
01:29:57,248 --> 01:30:00,064
Long blonde hair

1840
01:30:00,320 --> 01:30:06,464
But they all had kind of a distinctive look one clean-cut one soda from P1 long

1841
01:30:06,720 --> 01:30:07,232
Long-haired

1842
01:30:07,744 --> 01:30:08,256
Pennywise

1843
01:30:10,560 --> 01:30:11,328
But I don't know

1844
01:30:11,584 --> 01:30:14,912
I don't think the X-Files predicted that I covid vaccines

1845
01:30:15,168 --> 01:30:18,752
I'm so bummed out I'm so impulsive

1846
01:30:19,008 --> 01:30:21,824
Spike protein

1847
01:30:22,080 --> 01:30:23,872
Yeah yeah

1848
01:30:24,128 --> 01:30:24,896
Of course not

1849
01:30:25,408 --> 01:30:27,712
I like I was very disappointed by this

1850
01:30:28,224 --> 01:30:29,760
This Theory

1851
01:30:30,016 --> 01:30:31,296
Bums me out so hard

1852
01:30:31,552 --> 01:30:35,392
All of that kind of predictive programming south or or somebody being like

1853
01:30:35,648 --> 01:30:39,488
The CIA came to me and told me what was going to happen with the World Trade Center and then

1854
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:40,768
After a

1855
01:30:41,024 --> 01:30:45,120
Decade of just believing s*** that people told me about it I read up on it

1856
01:30:45,376 --> 01:30:46,912
No he attacked

1857
01:30:47,168 --> 01:30:48,192
Before he said why

1858
01:30:50,240 --> 01:30:51,264
Simple

1859
01:30:51,520 --> 01:30:52,032
Conspiracies

1860
01:30:52,288 --> 01:30:53,824
There's not the CIA involved

1861
01:30:54,336 --> 01:30:57,920
This was the whole point how did I how did I not know the very obvious

1862
01:30:59,200 --> 01:30:59,712
It's in.

1863
01:31:00,224 --> 01:31:04,064
The other the other ideas of kotoko Truth are far more interest

1864
01:31:04,320 --> 01:31:06,368
You can start

1865
01:31:08,416 --> 01:31:13,792
You know I think I think one of the most pressing questions in the world right now you might think it's like climate change

1866
01:31:14,304 --> 01:31:20,192
Oh yeah no I mean the rainforest is emitting more CO2 than it's absorbing so

1867
01:31:21,984 --> 01:31:23,264
Real real problem

1868
01:31:23,520 --> 01:31:26,848
It's a bummer is a real bummer shoes that we have

1869
01:31:27,104 --> 01:31:28,640
Like to deal with but I think of one of the more

1870
01:31:28,896 --> 01:31:29,920
Pressing issues even than that

1871
01:31:30,176 --> 01:31:31,968
Is whether or not we're in a simulation

1872
01:31:32,736 --> 01:31:33,504
And thankfully

1873
01:31:33,760 --> 01:31:35,296
I think Alex has an answer

1874
01:31:38,624 --> 01:31:39,136
Jacquees

1875
01:31:39,392 --> 01:31:42,208
You're held in some alien simulation is Vault

1876
01:31:44,768 --> 01:31:46,304
Actually listen right now

1877
01:31:46,816 --> 01:31:48,864
Alien simulation

1878
01:31:49,376 --> 01:31:53,216
The simulation on the guy that knew about it on the guy that warned about it

1879
01:31:53,728 --> 01:31:57,568
Joe Rogan podcast

1880
01:31:58,592 --> 01:31:59,616
Talk to him all the time

1881
01:32:01,664 --> 01:32:07,808
TV host Tucker Carlson and we're Buddies

1882
01:32:09,344 --> 01:32:11,392
Developing a plan to fight the New World Order

1883
01:32:13,696 --> 01:32:14,464
I'm like okay

1884
01:32:15,232 --> 01:32:16,256
Is this a simulation

1885
01:32:17,024 --> 01:32:17,792
Cuz that would be a lot better

1886
01:32:18,304 --> 01:32:19,584
Got killer bug in Africa

1887
01:32:20,352 --> 01:32:21,888
Henry Kissinger is not real

1888
01:32:22,912 --> 01:32:24,192
Prince Philip's not real

1889
01:32:24,960 --> 01:32:25,984
Simulation

1890
01:32:27,264 --> 01:32:28,544
My mother's not real

1891
01:32:29,056 --> 01:32:29,568
Not real

1892
01:32:30,080 --> 01:32:31,616
Life's not real

1893
01:32:33,152 --> 01:32:33,664
You're getting it

1894
01:32:33,920 --> 01:32:34,688
My crew is it real

1895
01:32:35,456 --> 01:32:37,248
John over there running the Boom is not real

1896
01:32:37,760 --> 01:32:39,296
John Deere real aren't you John

1897
01:32:41,088 --> 01:32:42,624
John thinks he's real

1898
01:32:44,672 --> 01:32:47,488
Stupid assholes

1899
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:49,792
Imagine being Alex Jones

1900
01:33:03,872 --> 01:33:05,408
Live in a simulation

1901
01:33:07,200 --> 01:33:08,224
How about some people say off

1902
01:33:10,528 --> 01:33:11,552
The third Dimensions real

1903
01:33:13,344 --> 01:33:14,880
Made this as a genetic

1904
01:33:15,136 --> 01:33:16,928
Real world real life

1905
01:33:17,440 --> 01:33:17,952
Simulation

1906
01:33:19,744 --> 01:33:22,560
So then we are in a simulation but it's a god simulation

1907
01:33:24,096 --> 01:33:24,608
Cool

1908
01:33:25,632 --> 01:33:27,168
Coco cool

1909
01:33:27,680 --> 01:33:32,544
How do you answering that question about whether or not

1910
01:33:32,800 --> 01:33:34,080
Existence is real

1911
01:33:34,336 --> 01:33:34,848
It's not but

1912
01:33:35,872 --> 01:33:36,384
It's not aliens

1913
01:33:36,640 --> 01:33:37,152
God or some

1914
01:33:37,664 --> 01:33:39,968
Yeah I mean I think the the more important

1915
01:33:40,736 --> 01:33:41,504
Though is that

1916
01:33:41,760 --> 01:33:43,040
Regardless of whether a real

1917
01:33:43,552 --> 01:33:44,832
How real or not it is

1918
01:33:45,088 --> 01:33:46,112
Is it doesn't really matter you're just

1919
01:33:46,368 --> 01:33:46,880
Going to keep going about

1920
01:33:47,136 --> 01:33:47,648
Your day

1921
01:33:47,904 --> 01:33:48,672
So

1922
01:33:49,184 --> 01:33:55,328
I am outside of the possibility of having telekinesis if you can break through the simulation or something

1923
01:33:56,864 --> 01:34:02,496
And if I can ever find any evidence that anyone has ever done that or that's possible I'll get very excited to hear that

1924
01:34:02,752 --> 01:34:03,264
Super

1925
01:34:03,520 --> 01:34:05,824
Let's assume that we are in a simulation

1926
01:34:06,848 --> 01:34:08,384
The worst case scenario of

1927
01:34:08,640 --> 01:34:09,408
Acting as if

1928
01:34:10,176 --> 01:34:14,016
It's not a simulation that we are in the real world where there are consequences and everyone

1929
01:34:14,272 --> 01:34:14,784
Existence

1930
01:34:15,040 --> 01:34:19,904
We have responsibilities towards each other so is at the end of it you're like

1931
01:34:20,160 --> 01:34:22,464
Boy I was foolish for thinking that

1932
01:34:22,720 --> 01:34:24,512
That's not that bad

1933
01:34:24,768 --> 01:34:29,888
You know the thought occurs to me and I haven't I haven't really answered the opposite of Pascal's wager

1934
01:34:30,144 --> 01:34:32,960
It is going to lose

1935
01:34:33,216 --> 01:34:33,984
Eeyore Winnie their way

1936
01:34:35,264 --> 01:34:35,776
Pascal's

1937
01:34:36,288 --> 01:34:42,432
It it's it did occur to me when you just pointed that out that if you see through the simulation you might get telekinetic powers or whatever like going

1938
01:34:42,688 --> 01:34:43,456
Director The Matrix

1939
01:34:43,968 --> 01:34:47,296
Even if you weren't Mio you could still do giant ass jumped

1940
01:34:47,552 --> 01:34:48,320
Some s*** you know you could

1941
01:34:48,576 --> 01:34:53,184
Could you still had special powers never occurred to me that I would rather

1942
01:34:53,440 --> 01:34:59,584
F*** the stake-bed Johnny talking about

1943
01:34:59,840 --> 01:35:02,400
Johnny Leguizamo Johnny legs

1944
01:35:02,912 --> 01:35:05,216
Lower body

1945
01:35:05,984 --> 01:35:09,056
It's like the steak and all that sound I'm going to stay in The Matrix

1946
01:35:09,312 --> 01:35:10,848
Because I can jump

1947
01:35:11,360 --> 01:35:12,640
Across roof building

1948
01:35:12,896 --> 01:35:14,432
Lakeside School

1949
01:35:14,688 --> 01:35:16,224
Can't jump across roof building

1950
01:35:16,480 --> 01:35:17,248
Unless you've

1951
01:35:17,504 --> 01:35:18,528
Been taken out of The Matrix

1952
01:35:19,552 --> 01:35:20,064
Right

1953
01:35:20,576 --> 01:35:21,600
Oh that's a good question

1954
01:35:25,696 --> 01:35:26,720
Yeah

1955
01:35:26,976 --> 01:35:28,000
Betrayal

1956
01:35:28,512 --> 01:35:30,304
But still want to take me home

1957
01:35:32,864 --> 01:35:35,168
Alex at this point spends would have time taking calls

1958
01:35:35,424 --> 01:35:41,568
And I want to address something really fast because I do believe that somebody called into the show was maybe a listener varsho

1959
01:35:42,080 --> 01:35:42,592
And

1960
01:35:42,848 --> 01:35:48,992
No no y no harm no foul no I'm not mad at anybody but I would like to take this opportunity to read

1961
01:35:49,248 --> 01:35:49,760
Reiterate

1962
01:35:50,016 --> 01:35:54,624
That we discourage people from calling into Alex's showed messing with him

1963
01:35:54,880 --> 01:35:59,488
I am the primary reason for that is that I don't believe that it is ethical

1964
01:35:59,744 --> 01:36:00,256
Or us

1965
01:36:00,512 --> 01:36:03,072
To do this show where we go over his content

1966
01:36:03,328 --> 01:36:04,352
If there is

1967
01:36:04,864 --> 01:36:07,424
A possibility that we are directly affect

1968
01:36:07,680 --> 01:36:08,192
Think is content

1969
01:36:08,704 --> 01:36:11,776
And I think that somebody calling and it was one of our listeners

1970
01:36:12,032 --> 01:36:14,592
And bringing up things from our show

1971
01:36:14,848 --> 01:36:15,360
Or something

1972
01:36:15,872 --> 01:36:17,664
To him is too much of

1973
01:36:17,920 --> 01:36:18,688
Incursion

1974
01:36:18,944 --> 01:36:20,224
Into his contact

1975
01:36:20,480 --> 01:36:24,064
Becomes a situation where I can't really know what is what

1976
01:36:24,576 --> 01:36:26,624
I believe we were talking before the show

1977
01:36:27,136 --> 01:36:30,208
And I was like wecantstudy him in his natural habitat

1978
01:36:30,464 --> 01:36:30,976
If we are at the

1979
01:36:31,232 --> 01:36:32,768
Affecting the natural habitat

1980
01:36:33,024 --> 01:36:35,584
Interacting with it and I try to

1981
01:36:35,840 --> 01:36:36,608
Keep that as a

1982
01:36:37,376 --> 01:36:37,888
Asbestos

1983
01:36:38,144 --> 01:36:38,656
As possible

1984
01:36:39,168 --> 01:36:45,312
Now we did do and we agreed to be in the New York Times Story show what are the reasons that I felt that was kind of

1985
01:36:45,568 --> 01:36:46,848
Okay was that

1986
01:36:47,616 --> 01:36:48,384
We were

1987
01:36:48,896 --> 01:36:49,408
It's not

1988
01:36:50,432 --> 01:36:51,200
Totally

1989
01:36:51,456 --> 01:36:54,016
Affecting the content just the awareness that we agree

1990
01:36:54,272 --> 01:36:57,088
And we already knew they were aware of our existence

1991
01:36:57,344 --> 01:36:57,856
Sure

1992
01:36:58,112 --> 01:36:59,392
The Following on Twitter

1993
01:36:59,904 --> 01:37:00,416
And what have you

1994
01:37:01,696 --> 01:37:04,768
But the direct interference I just I find it

1995
01:37:05,024 --> 01:37:07,328
Attributes makes me kind of uncomfortable

1996
01:37:07,840 --> 01:37:09,632
I can't make anyone

1997
01:37:09,888 --> 01:37:10,400
Bay Haven

1998
01:37:10,656 --> 01:37:12,704
A certain way like literally I can't say

1999
01:37:12,960 --> 01:37:15,776
Don't call in and expect anyone to care

2000
01:37:16,032 --> 01:37:17,056
But this is a curd

2001
01:37:17,312 --> 01:37:18,848
To see if you if you

2002
01:37:19,104 --> 01:37:21,920
About what my position is I would appreciate it

2003
01:37:22,176 --> 01:37:23,712
If people didn't call it is much

2004
01:37:23,968 --> 01:37:24,992
Phone is it might be

2005
01:37:26,016 --> 01:37:27,808
I don't think

2006
01:37:28,064 --> 01:37:28,832
Kind of

2007
01:37:29,088 --> 01:37:29,600
Serves

2008
01:37:30,112 --> 01:37:31,904
It works across my purpose

2009
01:37:32,160 --> 01:37:33,184
Yeah I mean

2010
01:37:33,952 --> 01:37:36,256
To go to to go to Survivor

2011
01:37:36,512 --> 01:37:41,632
You know eventually whenever the metagame becomes more important or as important as the game

2012
01:37:41,888 --> 01:37:42,656
Then it's just a day

2013
01:37:43,680 --> 01:37:44,704
It's a different thing and it's

2014
01:37:44,960 --> 01:37:45,984
Eventually

2015
01:37:47,264 --> 01:37:48,032
You know and 4

2016
01:37:48,544 --> 01:37:51,360
We're doing a show about him not a show about

2017
01:37:51,616 --> 01:37:52,896
Him talking about us

2018
01:37:53,408 --> 01:37:54,688
Talking about him talking about

2019
01:37:54,944 --> 01:37:58,016
You know we didn't go over the episode where Harrison

2020
01:37:58,272 --> 01:37:59,552
I was talking about

2021
01:37:59,808 --> 01:38:02,624
It's not that's not something I have that much interest

2022
01:38:03,648 --> 01:38:04,928
And for the Survivor metaphor

2023
01:38:05,440 --> 01:38:05,952
Alright Propst

2024
01:38:06,464 --> 01:38:07,744
Can like stir up drama

2025
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:09,792
At Tribal Council

2026
01:38:10,048 --> 01:38:12,864
But if he were like on the beach

2027
01:38:13,120 --> 01:38:16,960
Vietnam

2028
01:38:17,216 --> 01:38:19,008
And then at Tribal Council was like

2029
01:38:19,264 --> 01:38:22,592
So there's some conflict today

2030
01:38:25,408 --> 01:38:26,176
Onyx

2031
01:38:26,944 --> 01:38:29,760
So I am no disrespect to the person who I believe was

2032
01:38:30,016 --> 01:38:31,808
A listener varsho called

2033
01:38:32,064 --> 01:38:32,832
Actually I think they're called

2034
01:38:33,088 --> 01:38:35,136
Fine but I'm not going to play any other on the show

2035
01:38:35,648 --> 01:38:39,744
I do not want to incentivize that behavior exactly now that's your another call

2036
01:38:45,120 --> 01:38:46,400
It feels like we're no longer

2037
01:38:46,656 --> 01:38:51,264
Peaceful Revolution

2038
01:38:51,776 --> 01:38:56,640
Vaccines virus maybe it's just cuz he's telling you you're in a violent War

2039
01:38:56,896 --> 01:38:59,712
Open borders with demoralisation

2040
01:39:02,272 --> 01:39:03,040
America Center

2041
01:39:05,600 --> 01:39:06,880
Does it mean people are

2042
01:39:07,136 --> 01:39:09,696
Revolution already

2043
01:39:09,952 --> 01:39:13,280
Yes I mean like I think that this caller has accurately assess the

2044
01:39:13,536 --> 01:39:16,608
The tone that Alex is bringing to the show at this point

2045
01:39:16,864 --> 01:39:23,008
He said everybody could have died 15 times on this show many times

2046
01:39:23,264 --> 01:39:29,408
Feel like there's a violent revolution

2047
01:39:29,664 --> 01:39:32,224
I want to look to your side and see Rainbow dildo

2048
01:39:34,272 --> 01:39:34,784
Adele

2049
01:39:35,040 --> 01:39:38,624
You need a little levity if you're in if you're in a foxhole you know sure

2050
01:39:38,880 --> 01:39:43,232
So what last clip of a call that Alex Gibson

2051
01:39:43,744 --> 01:39:44,512
Troubling to me

2052
01:39:49,120 --> 01:39:49,888
Hey how you doing Alex

2053
01:39:53,472 --> 01:39:56,288
Are The Apocalypse of Abraham chapter 29

2054
01:39:56,544 --> 01:39:57,568
Donald Trump makes

2055
01:39:58,080 --> 01:39:59,616
Very good appearance and they're just say

2056
01:39:59,872 --> 01:40:02,944
Could being not all I'm doing is asking questions

2057
01:40:03,712 --> 01:40:04,736
Physical into exist

2058
01:40:06,528 --> 01:40:07,808
Quantum realm that means that everything

2059
01:40:08,064 --> 01:40:09,088
Saying every law that apply

2060
01:40:09,344 --> 01:40:11,392
Eyes in the physical are world

2061
01:40:13,440 --> 01:40:16,512
I mean that you look at Isaac Newton where every action has an equal and opposite

2062
01:40:16,768 --> 01:40:17,792
Reaction the same would have

2063
01:40:19,072 --> 01:40:19,584
Alright

2064
01:40:20,352 --> 01:40:21,376
We're at right now

2065
01:40:21,888 --> 01:40:25,216
1988 because if you look at revelation

2066
01:40:26,496 --> 01:40:28,032
3.5 years rights

2067
01:40:28,544 --> 01:40:29,056
Revelation

2068
01:40:29,312 --> 01:40:32,384
35 and there was given unto him a mouse speaking rate

2069
01:40:32,640 --> 01:40:33,152
Things in Black

2070
01:40:33,408 --> 01:40:38,528
Even power was given unto him to continue forty and two months that would be three point

2071
01:40:39,040 --> 01:40:41,600
Years Jesus was ministering for 3-point

2072
01:40:42,112 --> 01:40:42,880
5 years

2073
01:40:43,136 --> 01:40:49,280
You go to Revelation 20 Satan is bound and I saw than Angel come down and having the key

2074
01:40:50,048 --> 01:40:54,912
He laid hold of the Dragon

2075
01:40:58,496 --> 01:40:59,776
Thousand Years Jesus Christ

2076
01:41:00,288 --> 01:41:01,312
21 years old

2077
01:41:01,824 --> 01:41:02,848
2029

2078
01:41:03,104 --> 01:41:04,384
Going to be the beginning

2079
01:41:08,736 --> 01:41:11,552
Who are the globalist

2080
01:41:12,064 --> 01:41:13,856
In 2029 that they say that

2081
01:41:15,904 --> 01:41:16,416
That's official

2082
01:41:17,696 --> 01:41:18,464
Yeah I would

2083
01:41:18,720 --> 01:41:22,560
I would have a difficult time being a radio host hearing this stuff and be like

2084
01:41:23,072 --> 01:41:24,096
That makes sense

2085
01:41:25,888 --> 01:41:26,400
At the struggle

2086
01:41:26,912 --> 01:41:33,056
You know somebody somebody put out a question to a bunch of people I think is on like Gizmodo or something like

2087
01:41:33,312 --> 01:41:33,824
What's the most

2088
01:41:34,080 --> 01:41:35,360
Hamilton conspiracy theory

2089
01:41:36,128 --> 01:41:36,640
And

2090
01:41:36,896 --> 01:41:37,408
Like

2091
01:41:37,920 --> 01:41:44,064
Everybody had some fairly good responses you know like five of the normal ones but when you really

2092
01:41:44,320 --> 01:41:45,088
Get down to it man

2093
01:41:46,368 --> 01:41:52,256
John of Patmos hold out the worst conspiracy theory in the history of the world and it's

2094
01:41:52,512 --> 01:41:53,024
It's killing all

2095
01:41:53,280 --> 01:41:56,608
If you think if you think about it in terms of like longevity

2096
01:41:56,864 --> 01:41:58,144
There may be some truth

2097
01:41:59,168 --> 01:42:03,008
Yeah I don't know whatever conspiracy is like

2098
01:42:03,264 --> 01:42:05,568
Makes it so easy to accept all the rest of

2099
01:42:06,080 --> 01:42:11,968
Exact that's the one that yells dangerous as the lowest bar

2100
01:42:12,224 --> 01:42:13,248
Bulshit

2101
01:42:13,760 --> 01:42:16,064
First one is any con man with a smile

2102
01:42:16,576 --> 01:42:17,344
That's the worst

2103
01:42:18,880 --> 01:42:19,904
This episode sucks

2104
01:42:20,160 --> 01:42:24,000
I would say I think of it's a Alex's town is a

2105
01:42:24,256 --> 01:42:26,048
Extreme

2106
01:42:26,560 --> 01:42:31,424
What would make you say that then I don't I don't like the development of the

2107
01:42:31,680 --> 01:42:33,984
Idea that you have to escalate the globalist

2108
01:42:34,240 --> 01:42:35,264
The Killing you or else

2109
01:42:35,520 --> 01:42:37,568
They will just kill you later

2110
01:42:37,824 --> 01:42:40,384
Yeah that to me is something I'm going to keep an eye on

2111
01:42:40,640 --> 01:42:41,152
Cuz it worries

2112
01:42:41,664 --> 01:42:42,944
No he when he was talking to the

2113
01:42:43,200 --> 01:42:49,344
The f****** Boogaloo boys he was trying to push back on less incendiary s*** than that I wonder I wonder

2114
01:42:49,600 --> 01:42:52,160
Alex even understands the implications

2115
01:42:52,416 --> 01:42:53,952
Listen to the things you saying

2116
01:42:54,208 --> 01:42:54,976
They sincerely Wonder

2117
01:42:55,488 --> 01:42:57,024
It just seems like he's having a mad day

2118
01:42:57,280 --> 01:42:59,328
Having a bad one

2119
01:43:02,400 --> 01:43:03,936
