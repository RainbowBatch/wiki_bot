11
00:01:24,736 --> 00:01:28,320
I saw those Coca-Cola with coffee gathering at me

12
00:01:28,576 --> 00:01:34,720

00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:36,160
Some of the problems of the coffee

34
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:42,560

00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:16,864
How long

46
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,424

47
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,192
Before I try

48
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:20,960

We also have conversations about how much I love nature and how you think it sucks

58
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:55,776

59
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:57,056

00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:04,127
Turn of the millennium

82
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:06,175

83
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:06,943
The Iraq War

84
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:11,039

00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:49,599
Kantime and

114
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:55,487
I've made this call on the show before I think I did it at a time when we had a smaller audience

115
00:06:55,743 --> 00:06:56,511
Then we do now

116
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:58,303
And maybe just have a little bit more reach

117
00:06:58,815 --> 00:07:02,911
I am so is anybody out there listening has access to really old Alex

118
00:07:03,167 --> 00:07:03,935

00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:14,431
Stuff from like 95 96 97

122
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:19,295
And if anybody has a line on those I've tried a number of avenues

123
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:21,087
And they all kind of reach that at

124
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:23,135
A lot of people have

125
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:24,415
Some tips

126
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:25,951

127
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:27,231

128
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:28,255
I have not

129
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:33,119
Last option

130
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:39,519

137
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:51,807
That for sure

138
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:53,343
But it's very very

139
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:56,415

And

146
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:10,239
You know it's tough

147
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:11,519
Challenge

148
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:13,311

Techniques on the styles that are used in the conversation

156
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:38,911
As I started thinking like

157
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:40,447

158
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:44,287

And get his view on politics and quote conspiracies

165
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:15,263
So that is good

166
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:17,055
Enough

167
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:18,079

00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:20,895
Not enough this is before The Joe Rogan Experience

00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:28,831

00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:44,959
At the very least we know he does not have 100 million dollars yet he certainly doesn't

178
00:09:45,727 --> 00:09:47,519
But he does have a friend okay

179
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:54,943

180
00:09:56,735 --> 00:09:58,527

00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:13,375
Take a little bit of a load off from present-day nonsense

185
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:15,167
Maybe a little bit lighter

186
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:17,215
This was back when Eddie Bravo is still a

187
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:17,983

00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:22,847
He is

190
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:25,919
Pizza

191
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:33,343
He's not made for SEC controlled thing

192
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:35,135
We'll get to it when we get today

193
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:38,975
So Alex is going to talk to them at the end of the

194
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:41,023
Let's start our baby

195
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:43,583
I wonder what's going on beforehand

196
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:46,399
What sort of show they're going to buy

197
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:47,167
If buy a

198
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:53,567
Appearing on it being advertised as credits on the show what are they basically wearing elephant

199
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:55,615
So are we get to

200
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:56,895
Talking about how

201
00:10:57,151 --> 00:11:03,295
Back when his grandma's was around you know Grandma's time it was offensive to see a belly button

202
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:05,087
Then I Dream of Jeannie okay

203
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:06,879
But now Society is collapsing

204
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:10,719
I was talking to my mom and she was discussing her grandmother

205
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:11,743
Back in the sixties

206
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:13,791
Was over at their house

207
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:16,351
And she saw I Dream of Jeannie

208
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:18,143
And she was just shocked

209
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:18,911
Halifax

210
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:21,727
Was visible

211
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:23,519
And now

212
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:25,823
You can make fun of people

213
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:27,359
Shocked by things

214
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:32,991
Like that but civilizations have been wild and crazy before

215
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:41,951
People singing

216
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:44,767
Millions and millions

217
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:48,607
Simulated murders

218
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:49,375
Austin torture

219
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:52,703
And every time I go to a movie.

220
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:55,007
A fan really violent films

221
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:57,311
What

222
00:11:57,567 --> 00:11:59,103
What is a serious contact

223
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:02,687
I would like to be there when the road came out

224
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:04,991
A few years ago I saw it on DVD and was

225
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:06,527
Profoundly affect

226
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:08,319
Goodbye because I'm

227
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:10,111
I don't know

228
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:12,415
Cannibalism in deprivation

229
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:14,463
I never

230
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:15,231
Are you

231
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:17,791
I never put the pieces together until that clip

232
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:23,679
Entire idea of like everyone becomes a cannibal within 15 days is just from the road

233
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:24,447
Straight up

234
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:29,823
Yeah I wouldn't I wouldn't rely on Cormac McCarthy for the betterment of mankind

235
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:32,127
In terms of thematic elements

236
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:34,175
Alex pretend

237
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:38,015
Studies

238
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:40,319
Just kind of like a bunch of

239
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:44,415
Bad people who were cannibals in the road

240
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:46,719
If they made a movie of it I could see Alex

241
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:48,255
Is devil being based on the

242
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:50,047
Judge from Blood Meridian bud

243
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:51,071
That was a book

244
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:52,607
And it's hard to read even if you're good at

245
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:53,887
Readings out

246
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:55,167
Post-apocalyptic

247
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:59,263
Fiction novel

248
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:00,543
Viggo Mortensen

249
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:04,639
Yeah yeah yeah

250
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:07,967
Most historical examples of cannibalism have been in ritual contact

251
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:09,247
Text which makes sense because

252
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:10,527
Does the amount of energy

253
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:14,111
Exert to kill and eat an uncooperative human would not be worth

254
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:15,647
Whatever nutritional value game

255
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:17,695
He'll be smarter from a Clark

256
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:18,463
Perspective to eat

257
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:19,231
Just about anything

258
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:24,607
It's just another example of some supposedly research position that Alex is a

259
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:26,655
He's coming from a movie

260
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:30,239
Experience is real

261
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:33,055
I would argue that man

262
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:35,103
He's the most dangerous game

263
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:36,639
Because

264
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:40,991
It fights back and it's harder and crap is easier game

265
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:42,271
Yeah

266
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:48,159
And that includes leaves and s*** man it's not hard

267
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:49,439
And

268
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:53,279
The other thing to his icuee will find a number of examples over his

269
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:54,815
History of course of people who are in desperate

270
00:13:55,071 --> 00:14:00,703
Cannibalism

271
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:01,983
It would make those

272
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:03,263
Sort of unique

273
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:07,103
Isolation

274
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:08,127
Crucial for those

275
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:09,151
Yeah it's

276
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:10,175
The lack of

277
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:11,967
Other legitimate option

278
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:16,063
Eat somebody

279
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:18,111
If they were on

280
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:19,391
Perhaps

281
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:20,159
A road

282
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:25,023
It would be far easier the problem for many of these people is that they are

283
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:30,143
In the middle of nowhere with no hope of Escape or is wildlife

284
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:32,447
Substantially easier and better.

285
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:33,215
Forever 12

286
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:33,983
Not eat

287
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:36,799
So much better than a teepee

288
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:40,383
You don't need to wait 15 days to fix

289
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:42,175
So dumb

290
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:43,199
Hello what a dumb dumb

291
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:45,503
I'm not going to eat any of these goddamn fruits

292
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:48,063
So Alex has this idea that like

293
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:50,111
Any easier to touch. It in that last clip

294
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:52,671
This notion that fake violence

295
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:54,719
On TV and seeing it

296
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:55,743
Makes you

297
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:59,583
Experience at the same way you'd experience real violence

298
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:00,863
And I have some thoughts

299
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:01,887
Oh yeah

300
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:03,167
Or somebody who shocked

301
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:04,959
Buy images of violence and death

302
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:06,239
Someone

303
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:16,223
Mackinvia

304
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:20,063
Shocked by the image of children have been Napalm with their skin burned off

305
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:22,623
People were shocked by the image of

306
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:24,159
Vietnamese police

307
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:26,719
Blowing a man's head off in the street

308
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:31,327
That's what now

309
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:33,887
Not the

310
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:37,983
B they don't have a

311
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:39,007
Common sense

312
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:42,591
And see they have an experienced trauma

313
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:45,407
Wild

314
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:47,967
And this is all been done by

315
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:54,367
Your kids

316
00:15:56,159 --> 00:16:00,511
You're even your own family isn't going to be shocked by to just accept it bad things

317
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:04,351
Because the mind

318
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:05,887
As

319
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:07,167
Ezreal

320
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:13,823
Cut off

321
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:16,127
The clip is really key to me

322
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:17,919
It's one of the only times I

323
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:20,735
Remember we're really disappointed he got cut off by the brake

324
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:22,783
Kind of interested in where he was going

325
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:28,159
A Galaxy's lamenting how fake violence on TV is experienced by people as real violin

326
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:30,207
Sensitize them to see against

327
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:31,487
Centers of real-life vile

328
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:37,375
I don't know how common that is necessarily as a phenomenon I bet there is some

329
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:39,167
A fact that it has but

330
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:42,239
I know that I've seen plenty of horror movies in my life and I still pretty much

331
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:43,263
Experience

332
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:44,031
The violence

333
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:45,055
What's that I do

334
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:45,823
Actual

335
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:48,639
Pro wrestling is a really good example of

336
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:54,271
I can watch people hit each other with chairs and send each other through tables

337
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:55,807
Real I would not enjoy it

338
00:16:56,575 --> 00:17:00,927
Anytime it appears that someone is actually hurt themselves in a wrestling reality Creeps in and

339
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:02,975
Become worried for the performer

340
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:05,279
Because it's possible to enjoy the narrative.

341
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:06,559
Depiction of combat

342
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:08,095
And still remember that it's

343
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:09,375
The performer performing

344
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:13,727
Then there's stuff like the UFC where people are fighting for real and people are

345
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:14,495
Trying to hurry

346
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:17,567
This is still kind of ritualize violin

347
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:18,591
Everyone watches

348
00:17:18,847 --> 00:17:20,895
Understand that these are two trained competitors

349
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:22,431
Agreed to fight each other under

350
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:23,455
Specific rules

351
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:24,735
To see who's better at the sport

352
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:26,783
It's closer to real-world violence

353
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:28,831
Formalize professional

354
00:17:29,343 --> 00:17:30,623
Both parties have consented

355
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:32,415
Do what's going on

356
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:35,743
And then there's movies right

357
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:39,583
Right which are just totally fictional fictional yes

358
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:40,863
Most people can tell the

359
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:41,887
Prince between these forms of

360
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:43,935
Display the violence and experienced them differ

361
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:47,007
Currently weather that different experiences conscious or subconscious

362
00:17:48,031 --> 00:17:49,311
It seems to me that Alex cannot

363
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:51,359
And he assumes that because that is his

364
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:52,127
Experience

365
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:54,687
Everyone else must also not be able to differentiate

366
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:57,247
Now here's where this point gets

367
00:17:57,503 --> 00:17:58,015
Important

368
00:17:58,783 --> 00:18:00,319
Because Alex can't tell the difference between

369
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:01,343
Fiction and reality

370
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:03,135
You can't also tell the

371
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:04,415
Prince between reality and

372
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:07,999
In the same way that he thinks that a fictional movie like the road

373
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:09,279
Depict illegitimate realist

374
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:10,559
The cannibal future

375
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:12,863
You have the tendency to think very real thing

376
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:14,143
Like a Sandy Hook shooting

377
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:15,679
We're completely stage

378
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:17,983
Alex pretends that exposure

379
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:19,007
Two petitions violence

380
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:21,311
Has made everyone desensitized to real-world Island

381
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:25,919
And yet in my experience what are the major themes of the show is denying the experiences of

382
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:26,687
People who

383
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:28,735
Experience the effects of real-world violence

384
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:29,759
Because he thinks

385
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:33,855
I think that's an important dynamic 22rec

386
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:37,439
Yeah that mean there's that extra level of not just

387
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:38,463
Because you know

388
00:18:38,975 --> 00:18:39,999
She can't tell the difference

389
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:41,535
Between reality and fix

390
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:43,839
And so he assumes everybody else can

391
00:18:44,863 --> 00:18:46,911
I do think there is a

392
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:47,679
Dynamite

393
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:49,727
But that like second level of of

394
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:50,495
Course he

395
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:52,287
Pant also not

396
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:53,567
Assume that of everyone

397
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:55,615
Because if he were to realize that

398
00:18:55,871 --> 00:18:56,639
People can

399
00:18:56,895 --> 00:18:57,407
Easily

400
00:18:58,431 --> 00:18:58,943
Where's between reality

401
00:18:59,199 --> 00:19:00,223
Infection

402
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:01,503
An attack upon Him person

403
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:04,575
Or it would tell him that it's possible to tell the

404
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:06,111
Between reality and

405
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:07,647
You know so

406
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:08,927
The only way that

407
00:19:09,183 --> 00:19:10,463
He can maintain his psyche

408
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:12,511
Through this is by assuming

409
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:13,535
That not only

410
00:19:14,047 --> 00:19:15,327
Can nobody else tell the difference

411
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:16,351
Between reality and

412
00:19:16,863 --> 00:19:18,399
He's the only person

413
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:19,935
Who can tell you

414
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:20,959
You can't tell that

415
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:22,239
Difference between reality and

416
00:19:22,751 --> 00:19:23,263
Yeah

417
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:24,031
Perhaps that is

418
00:19:24,543 --> 00:19:25,055
That is true

419
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:26,335
Yeah he's a mess

420
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:28,895
That's a real bummer

421
00:19:29,663 --> 00:19:32,991
Another story that's going around

422
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:36,575
This is this is interesting to me because

423
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:39,135
You know about the political divide

424
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:45,535
Left-right Paradigm is an illusion and it's all meant

425
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:46,815
Democrat

426
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:48,351
Right

427
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:49,631
Republican

428
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:52,447
Meaningless words just inviting

429
00:19:52,703 --> 00:19:53,215
For no reason

430
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:54,495
This seems weird

431
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:55,519
2010

432
00:19:56,287 --> 00:19:58,079
This is a big story and Infowars

433
00:19:58,335 --> 00:20:01,663
Dot-com by Kurt demo Pennsylvania Homeland Security put the and attack protesters

434
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:02,943
Unlisted

435
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:03,711
And we got

436
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:05,503
Same reports out of Texas

437
00:20:06,015 --> 00:20:07,039
6 years ago

438
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:09,087
Western Gun Owners veterans

439
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:10,623
As the number one threat

440
00:20:11,135 --> 00:20:13,439
But because it was Bush's Administration doing it

441
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:15,743
Conservative media wouldn't pick up on it

442
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:17,279
Now that it's Obama

443
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:20,351
Meet the new boss same as the old boss

444
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:22,399
Like the song says

445
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:24,447
It's like oh my gosh

446
00:20:24,703 --> 00:20:25,727
Conservative

447
00:20:25,983 --> 00:20:27,775
You've always been the enemy

448
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:32,127
Watch conservative pundits

449
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:34,431
On Fox and it wasn't on the radio

450
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:35,199
Read

451
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:43,903
I knew they were reading Federal demonization scrubs

452
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:47,231
Floating the teleprompter is a globalist

453
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:49,791
They're getting a direct

454
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:51,839
Government propaganda feed

455
00:20:52,095 --> 00:20:53,119
We know they're bad

456
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:54,655
Open and shut

457
00:20:54,911 --> 00:20:55,935
If you under

458
00:20:56,191 --> 00:20:59,007
Understand what are you saying

459
00:20:59,263 --> 00:21:02,847
He's saying when he's trying to make this argument that he's Above This sort of left right

460
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:06,431
He's saying

461
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:07,711
That

462
00:21:08,223 --> 00:21:09,247
Obama

463
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:10,527
Is targeting

464
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:11,551
Conservative

465
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:13,343
In the same way that

466
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:15,135
The conservative

467
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:15,903
Targeted

468
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:18,976
Still left isn't

469
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:21,792
The target of any of this stuff in

470
00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:23,328
If they are always

471
00:21:23,584 --> 00:21:26,656
The victim of no matter what

472
00:21:27,168 --> 00:21:28,448
The enemy of the global

473
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,240
He's vs conservative

474
00:21:30,496 --> 00:21:32,800
Like Alex's

475
00:21:33,568 --> 00:21:34,592
Interesting

476
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:37,152
It's only the only the far-right

477
00:21:38,176 --> 00:21:38,944
Only the flower

478
00:21:39,456 --> 00:21:42,272
But it is interesting that he can articulate this

479
00:21:42,528 --> 00:21:46,112
This idea doesn't matter who's in charge after all the same but

480
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:46,880
The thing that he's

481
00:21:47,392 --> 00:21:48,672
They're all the same

482
00:21:48,928 --> 00:21:49,440
What is that

483
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:50,976
They're all globalist

484
00:21:51,232 --> 00:21:51,744
To hate

485
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:54,048
Super fall right people

486
00:21:54,304 --> 00:21:58,400
Yeah I mean essentially it's like a we don't have any white nationalist candidates and then

487
00:21:58,656 --> 00:21:59,168
Do they got a white

488
00:21:59,424 --> 00:22:03,008
Nationals candidate they were like holyshit this is what we've been

489
00:22:05,056 --> 00:22:07,872
You starting to see a little bit of the beginning of that materializes

490
00:22:08,128 --> 00:22:08,640
Going into

491
00:22:09,152 --> 00:22:09,920
A possibility

492
00:22:10,176 --> 00:22:14,016
Beat with the Tea Party being on the ride because of

493
00:22:14,528 --> 00:22:18,624
It was a major driver

494
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:21,696
Not cokehead brother

495
00:22:23,488 --> 00:22:27,072
So there is something that's going on

496
00:22:28,352 --> 00:22:28,864
At this point

497
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:29,632
In September

498
00:22:29,888 --> 00:22:32,192
And that is that Christine O'Donnell

499
00:22:32,448 --> 00:22:34,240
I was running for the seat

500
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:35,264
In Delaware

501
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:38,336
And there's been some

502
00:22:38,592 --> 00:22:39,872
A little bit of a problem

503
00:22:40,384 --> 00:22:43,200
Karl Rove had come out and you had an interview

504
00:22:43,712 --> 00:22:44,480
That was a little bit

505
00:22:44,736 --> 00:22:45,248
Play critical

506
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:47,040
Of of O'Donnell

507
00:22:47,296 --> 00:22:48,064
And Alex's

508
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:48,832
Is not happy

509
00:22:50,112 --> 00:22:56,256
Here is the New York Times today GOP leaders say Delaware upset

510
00:22:56,512 --> 00:22:57,280
Hertz

511
00:22:57,536 --> 00:22:58,304
Hopeful

512
00:22:59,072 --> 00:23:01,376
Now they basically said the same thing about Rand Paul

513
00:23:01,888 --> 00:23:02,400
Today

514
00:23:03,168 --> 00:23:05,216
The campaign against team

515
00:23:05,472 --> 00:23:06,752
They put all their money

516
00:23:07,264 --> 00:23:10,592
Behind the Republican establishment bailout candidate

517
00:23:10,848 --> 00:23:13,664
They demonized him just like the Democrats are now doing

518
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:16,992
And he's widened his lead

519
00:23:17,504 --> 00:23:19,040
Against the Democrat

520
00:23:19,552 --> 00:23:21,600
In the last few months since he won the Primary

521
00:23:22,624 --> 00:23:23,392
Against the Republic

522
00:23:23,904 --> 00:23:25,440
They said the same thing

523
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:27,232
People extreme like him

524
00:23:27,744 --> 00:23:29,280
And they lied about what he really stood for

525
00:23:29,536 --> 00:23:30,560
He can't win

526
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:31,840
Until they create the Shelf

527
00:23:35,168 --> 00:23:37,216
Because they can't win the Republican

528
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,032
Creating the hoax

529
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:41,568
With the Democrats

530
00:23:41,824 --> 00:23:44,896
Realty

531
00:23:45,152 --> 00:23:45,920
Actually

532
00:23:46,688 --> 00:23:47,712
You are against

533
00:23:48,224 --> 00:23:51,552
The out-of-control spending the banker bailouts and rust out of it

534
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,088
That that

535
00:23:54,624 --> 00:23:57,440
They can't win I need to go for establishment

536
00:23:57,952 --> 00:23:59,488
The same Republicans that are for

537
00:24:00,512 --> 00:24:01,536
More Banker bailout

538
00:24:02,048 --> 00:24:03,072
The same Republicans

539
00:24:03,584 --> 00:24:04,608
Under Bush.

540
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:08,192
The same Republicans like

541
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:11,008
Global carbon Tax Center

542
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:14,592
And

543
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:19,456
The hoax intensifies I have the transcript

544
00:24:19,968 --> 00:24:21,248
But it's up on

545
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:24,064
Infowars.com and prisonplanet.com

546
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,624
In an article that Paul Watson

547
00:24:27,392 --> 00:24:28,416
Anti-establishment

548
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,488
A hammer blow to the Washington Elite

549
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:32,768
Here's a transcript

550
00:24:33,024 --> 00:24:33,792
From Fox News

551
00:24:34,304 --> 00:24:36,864
From last night Karl Road questions

552
00:24:37,376 --> 00:24:39,168
Christine O'Donnell serious

553
00:24:39,424 --> 00:24:40,448
Character problems

554
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,496
And then I have the quotes here

555
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:47,360
Because it took years for her to pay off her student loans

556
00:24:47,872 --> 00:24:51,200
Bet that is deceptive again these serious questions about

557
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:52,480
How does she make her living

558
00:24:53,248 --> 00:24:54,016
Why did she

559
00:24:54,272 --> 00:24:56,064
Mislead voters about her college education

560
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:59,648
How come it took nearly two decades to Collegeville

561
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:02,208
I see numbers of upwards of half of

562
00:25:02,464 --> 00:25:04,768
Many college students now not paying their loans

563
00:25:05,024 --> 00:25:05,536
Cancel it

564
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:12,704
Yeah that would make sense you're on top of it you should absolutely cancel student

565
00:25:13,216 --> 00:25:13,728
Disposition

566
00:25:15,776 --> 00:25:16,544
That means

567
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:17,312
Bro was just

568
00:25:17,568 --> 00:25:19,616
Protecting his Brands hair and everybody's bran

569
00:25:20,128 --> 00:25:21,408
It's not really anything more inch

570
00:25:21,664 --> 00:25:24,992
Sting and seeing conventional Democrats be resistant to embrace AOC

571
00:25:25,504 --> 00:25:26,016
Enterprising

572
00:25:26,272 --> 00:25:26,784
There's just that

573
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:27,808
Pension

574
00:25:28,064 --> 00:25:30,624
Someone like O'Donnell in particular and the Aesthetics of

575
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:33,696
The Tea Party in general where this departure from the type of politics

576
00:25:33,952 --> 00:25:34,464
The Grove

577
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:35,744
Excel that for decades

578
00:25:36,256 --> 00:25:41,632
So I obviously would represent a threat to his position in the market either the strategist or commentator on Fox

579
00:25:41,888 --> 00:25:45,472
Yeah let's keep the depths of our evil quieter guys

580
00:25:46,496 --> 00:25:48,032
Is Karl rove's

581
00:25:48,288 --> 00:25:49,056
Philosophy I believe

582
00:25:49,312 --> 00:25:51,360
In the end was probably right

583
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:53,408
I know Donna was unlocked

584
00:25:54,176 --> 00:25:56,480
She finished third in the GOP Primary 2000

585
00:25:56,736 --> 00:25:57,248
Text after making

586
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:02,624
Pretty offensive comments about the lgbtq community and in Lost b2008 general elections

587
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:03,392
Joe Biden

588
00:26:03,648 --> 00:26:05,696
Who's simultaneously running for vice president

589
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:07,488
Dude followed this up by losing

590
00:26:07,744 --> 00:26:11,584
The 2010 general election after it came out that she had quote

591
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,120
Dappled in witchcraft

592
00:26:13,632 --> 00:26:14,912
In high school

593
00:26:15,168 --> 00:26:17,472
More to the problem released of this ad

594
00:26:19,008 --> 00:26:19,520
I'm not aware

595
00:26:21,056 --> 00:26:21,568
I'm nothing

596
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:22,592
You've heard

597
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:23,872
I'm you

598
00:26:25,152 --> 00:26:26,176
None of us are perfect

599
00:26:26,944 --> 00:26:27,712
But none of us

600
00:26:27,968 --> 00:26:28,480
Can be happy

601
00:26:28,736 --> 00:26:29,760
With what we see all around

602
00:26:30,784 --> 00:26:31,552
Politicians who

603
00:26:32,064 --> 00:26:32,576
Bending

604
00:26:32,832 --> 00:26:33,856
Trading favors

605
00:26:34,368 --> 00:26:35,648
Backroom deals are the ways to

606
00:26:35,904 --> 00:26:36,416
The standoff

607
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:38,720
I'll go to wash

608
00:26:39,744 --> 00:26:40,512
And do what you do

609
00:26:42,304 --> 00:26:43,328
I'm Christine O'Donnell

610
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:44,864
I approve this message

611
00:26:46,144 --> 00:26:46,656
I'm you

612
00:26:47,168 --> 00:26:50,496
I was really hoping she say I'm not a witch

613
00:26:50,752 --> 00:26:52,800
Cynthia just like just to reiterate

614
00:26:53,056 --> 00:26:55,360
I'm not awake

615
00:26:55,872 --> 00:26:56,640
I'm not a witch

616
00:26:56,896 --> 00:26:58,944
Obviously I don't care if someone mess around with sandwich

617
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:02,528
The coolest people I know it's been some time in that water

618
00:27:02,784 --> 00:27:04,320
I don't care but man Republic

619
00:27:04,576 --> 00:27:07,136
Looking boaters sure do

620
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:12,000
It's one thing to dabbles in witchcraft in your past when you're trying to run for office

621
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:13,792
But it's another thing to kuttanad that's

622
00:27:14,304 --> 00:27:15,584
I'm not a witch

623
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:19,424
That's so goofy and embarrassing from a political strategy perspective

624
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:22,240
Anyone who would do that is someone you shouldn't trust to make good decisions

625
00:27:22,496 --> 00:27:24,800
If you don't indication of them having bad dreams

626
00:27:25,056 --> 00:27:26,592
Surrounded by people Arvada

627
00:27:26,848 --> 00:27:28,128
10 states and neither is a good option

628
00:27:29,408 --> 00:27:31,456
This 2010 midterm and the Tea Party candidates

629
00:27:31,712 --> 00:27:33,248
Who came into office with a world warning

630
00:27:33,504 --> 00:27:34,528
Of the future we were heading toward

631
00:27:35,296 --> 00:27:36,832
It's not surprising to look back in 2010

632
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:39,136
Nancy Alex supporting someone like Christine O'Donnell

633
00:27:39,392 --> 00:27:42,208
Flash Forward to today to see him backing Marjorie Taylor Greene

634
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:43,488
Is what he does

635
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:47,840
The issues about O'Donnell's College history and Loans probably sound like Petty issues

636
00:27:48,352 --> 00:27:54,496
WinCo Road was making was more that the way that O'Donnell was addressing these questions about her history didn't come off as convinced

637
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,312
For instance as early as 2006

638
00:27:57,568 --> 00:28:00,384
She claimed to be a graduate of Fairleigh Dickinson University but

639
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:01,152
Actually didn't

640
00:28:01,664 --> 00:28:03,200
L degree until September 20th

641
00:28:03,456 --> 00:28:03,968
Attempt

642
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:06,528
The reason for the delay at first

643
00:28:06,784 --> 00:28:08,832
Couldn't claim to be student loan related issue

644
00:28:09,088 --> 00:28:09,856
I look at the lake

645
00:28:11,392 --> 00:28:13,952
But then the story became that she had to finish an outstanding elect

646
00:28:14,208 --> 00:28:14,720
Of course before

647
00:28:15,232 --> 00:28:15,744
Get her degree

648
00:28:16,256 --> 00:28:17,792
Road was expressing on Fox News

649
00:28:18,048 --> 00:28:20,096
But if she was going to win she would have to be more forthright

650
00:28:20,608 --> 00:28:21,632
He said exactly that

651
00:28:22,656 --> 00:28:28,544
She can't get away with simply saying my answers on my website or it's puzzling to me why the IRS would file a lien for me

652
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:29,824
When I didn't pay my taxes

653
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:30,848
2005

654
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,640
I mean she's got to be more honest than

655
00:28:33,152 --> 00:28:34,944
If she does she's got a shot to win

656
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,248
But it's got to be passionate and factual on hard head

657
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,040
Yeah you know and I

658
00:28:39,808 --> 00:28:41,088
The very

659
00:28:41,856 --> 00:28:44,672
You should have somebody like me if you're going to cut a political ad

660
00:28:45,184 --> 00:28:47,232
Because if you open with I'm not a witch

661
00:28:47,744 --> 00:28:50,048
The reasonable person's responses that's just what

662
00:28:50,304 --> 00:28:50,816
Which would say

663
00:28:51,072 --> 00:28:55,936
Right

664
00:28:56,192 --> 00:28:56,960
She's like

665
00:28:57,216 --> 00:28:57,984
Woodstock Inn right there

666
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:02,848
Anybody with

667
00:29:03,104 --> 00:29:05,408
Like just a little bit of political instinct

668
00:29:05,664 --> 00:29:07,200
Thanks for any awareness of how

669
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:09,248
The media Cycle Works

670
00:29:09,504 --> 00:29:10,272
You're going to get

671
00:29:10,528 --> 00:29:15,648
Piled on for that leave it alone I'm not a witch

672
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:22,048
So easy to ignore dad about how compassionate you are and how you care about the needs of the people of Delaware

673
00:29:22,304 --> 00:29:23,328
Don't jump

674
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,632
Get ahead of the whip

675
00:29:26,144 --> 00:29:31,264
I got to go. I got to get out in front of this witch thing

676
00:29:33,824 --> 00:29:35,360
What's really funny about that is

677
00:29:35,616 --> 00:29:37,152
Christine O'Donnell.

678
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:40,480
Immediately popped up there was a space in my brain for it

679
00:29:40,736 --> 00:29:43,808
But I wasn't 100% sure and then you said which and I was like

680
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:50,464
Oh yeah I remember that I remember that

681
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:53,280
All that much about hair appointment

682
00:29:53,536 --> 00:29:54,816
Because he likes who does

683
00:29:55,328 --> 00:29:55,840
Seem to like her

684
00:29:56,352 --> 00:29:57,888
I don't know this lady from them

685
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:00,704
Side of a barn

686
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:04,288
But the fact that that's how I take my pills

687
00:30:05,056 --> 00:30:07,616
The fact that the system is demonizing

688
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:15,040
The fact that they have the Republicans and Democrats coming out against her

689
00:30:15,296 --> 00:30:16,064
Cialix is just

690
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:17,088
Like the fire

691
00:30:18,112 --> 00:30:21,184
Tyrese

692
00:30:22,208 --> 00:30:24,000
Why isn't Alex talking about how she's a witch

693
00:30:26,304 --> 00:30:27,072
It's because

694
00:30:27,328 --> 00:30:31,168
Backflip doesn't come out until two days after

695
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,240
Boy

696
00:30:40,896 --> 00:30:42,944
Replace back two days later

697
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,504
Jesus

698
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:46,528
Snooze cycle

699
00:30:47,552 --> 00:30:49,344
Playing the clip

700
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,880
Rose

701
00:30:51,392 --> 00:30:52,672
Talking on Fox

702
00:30:52,928 --> 00:30:54,720
Snooze and I think this is really interesting

703
00:30:54,976 --> 00:30:55,488
Because Alex

704
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:56,512
Sex it up

705
00:30:56,768 --> 00:30:57,536
Pretty poorly

706
00:30:58,304 --> 00:30:59,584
Play Short clip

707
00:31:00,096 --> 00:31:01,120
I'm Coral Road

708
00:31:01,632 --> 00:31:03,424
Really demonizing

709
00:31:03,936 --> 00:31:04,960
This poor lady

710
00:31:05,472 --> 00:31:06,752
And just repeating

711
00:31:07,008 --> 00:31:10,080
That talking point over and over again that she has serious

712
00:31:10,592 --> 00:31:11,616
Character problem

713
00:31:15,968 --> 00:31:17,504
Find out what they are

714
00:31:18,784 --> 00:31:20,576
Oportun loans

715
00:31:20,832 --> 00:31:22,624
$11,000 lien on her

716
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:23,904
From the IRS

717
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,696
No due process I just slapped it on

718
00:31:26,976 --> 00:31:28,000
You know what if you poop

719
00:31:28,256 --> 00:31:29,024
For cap and tax

720
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:31,328
And you have an opponent that says they wouldn't

721
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,632
Then they have a choice they have an option

722
00:31:34,144 --> 00:31:36,960
It was it was very sensitive very based on issues

723
00:31:45,408 --> 00:31:49,760
It does conservatives support candidates who at the end of the day

724
00:31:50,272 --> 00:31:53,088
While they may be conservative in their public statements

725
00:31:53,344 --> 00:31:57,440
Do not Avenge the characteristics of rectitude and truthfulness

726
00:31:57,696 --> 00:32:02,560
And insincerity and character that they voters are looking I think

727
00:32:02,816 --> 00:32:04,864
She doesn't

728
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,192
This little guy up there high-and-mighty

729
00:32:13,568 --> 00:32:14,336
I tell you

730
00:32:14,592 --> 00:32:15,872
Yahoo

731
00:32:16,128 --> 00:32:19,200
Vote for who you can time the grand poobah

732
00:32:19,968 --> 00:32:21,760
I'm going to tell you Republicans what

733
00:32:22,016 --> 00:32:22,784
You can and can't do

734
00:32:23,296 --> 00:32:25,600
You're need to stay on the Karl Road reservation

735
00:32:25,856 --> 00:32:27,648
Because I am morally a Pyrex

736
00:32:28,416 --> 00:32:30,208
This is the guy lying about wmd

737
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:36,096
So what you have is Alex introduces this clamp in a way that the clip doesn't actually reflect what he say

738
00:32:36,352 --> 00:32:37,632
Is actually making a

739
00:32:37,888 --> 00:32:38,400
FairPoint

740
00:32:38,656 --> 00:32:39,424
In terms of the context

741
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:40,704
To this conversation

742
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:41,472
That is theirs

743
00:32:41,984 --> 00:32:42,752
Some kind of

744
00:32:43,008 --> 00:32:44,032
Non forthrightness

745
00:32:44,544 --> 00:32:45,056
What's going on

746
00:32:45,312 --> 00:32:47,104
Yeah that is not great

747
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:50,688
Yeah yeah Dan so in order for Alex to deal with lipids

748
00:32:50,944 --> 00:32:51,712
Play the attacks

749
00:32:51,968 --> 00:32:52,736
I'm sure he's just

750
00:32:52,992 --> 00:32:54,784
I don't care but

751
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:57,088
Sing f*** him and then you lied about weapons master

752
00:32:57,344 --> 00:32:59,904
Destruction doesn't deal with the issue that he brings up

753
00:33:00,416 --> 00:33:03,232
Oh my God you're all liars

754
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:07,584
Snarky

755
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:08,608
Debate kid

756
00:33:08,864 --> 00:33:10,912
Online and I would say that is a

757
00:33:11,168 --> 00:33:17,312
Who does the personal attack

758
00:33:17,824 --> 00:33:19,104
And I have scored a point

759
00:33:19,616 --> 00:33:20,896
Yeah whatever

760
00:33:22,944 --> 00:33:24,224
You can do it whenever I mean

761
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:25,504
The audience enjoys it

762
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:26,784
I think you even

763
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:27,808
I'm kind of enjoy it

764
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:28,832
Enjoy what

765
00:33:29,088 --> 00:33:32,160
Just piling on Karl Road

766
00:33:32,416 --> 00:33:34,208
Alright

767
00:33:34,976 --> 00:33:35,744
I don't have any

768
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,816
Skin in that game I just I just like to see a

769
00:33:39,072 --> 00:33:40,864
Baby s*** piled on car rollover

770
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:41,632
Is a good day for

771
00:33:42,912 --> 00:33:49,056
So it is next week we see Alex doing something we saw her recently on another I believe time travel episode

772
00:33:49,312 --> 00:33:49,824
We saw him

773
00:33:50,848 --> 00:33:52,896
Pretending to discover the strategy of

774
00:33:53,152 --> 00:33:56,480
Google bombing

775
00:34:07,744 --> 00:34:09,024
Google search the term

776
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,048
Gates death

777
00:34:10,304 --> 00:34:11,072
Panels

778
00:34:11,584 --> 00:34:12,352
Gates

779
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:15,168
Gates death

780
00:34:15,424 --> 00:34:15,936
Panels

781
00:34:16,448 --> 00:34:19,264
Just search those three words in Google

782
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:22,080
In every major search engine do it over and over again

783
00:34:22,336 --> 00:34:25,152
And send the story out to everyone and click on the story

784
00:34:25,408 --> 00:34:28,992
It's already the number one link and you type in Bill Gates death panel

785
00:34:29,248 --> 00:34:29,760
On

786
00:34:30,016 --> 00:34:32,320
Google news in its article regarding number one

787
00:34:39,232 --> 00:34:41,280
And then hundreds of papers and blogs if you've seen

788
00:34:45,632 --> 00:34:46,912
You'll cause another chain

789
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:47,936
Reaction

790
00:34:48,192 --> 00:34:48,704
Bill

791
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:53,312
Gates is who we're going after today and for the next 11 sheet

792
00:34:53,568 --> 00:34:55,616
Hellboy

793
00:34:57,664 --> 00:35:00,224
It's interesting to think about like the 11 years

794
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:01,248
Intermediate

795
00:35:01,504 --> 00:35:02,016
I like

796
00:35:02,272 --> 00:35:05,856
Free careers Allison Bill Gates

797
00:35:06,624 --> 00:35:12,768
There is there's a moment where they could have come together you know

798
00:35:13,024 --> 00:35:16,608
It's one of those I took the path less trod.

799
00:35:17,888 --> 00:35:18,656
Stylistics calls

800
00:35:19,168 --> 00:35:21,216
A lot of it ends up being about vaccine

801
00:35:21,728 --> 00:35:22,240
Sure

802
00:35:22,496 --> 00:35:23,008
A caller

803
00:35:23,776 --> 00:35:25,312
Today is because you're a witch

804
00:35:26,848 --> 00:35:28,640
This caller is is

805
00:35:28,896 --> 00:35:29,664
Is a

806
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:30,944
Scheduled to be vaccinated

807
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:32,736
Short as Alex has a

808
00:35:32,992 --> 00:35:33,504
But as waiter

809
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:34,272
Is it you

810
00:35:35,808 --> 00:35:37,344
Here's a bad metaphor

811
00:35:38,112 --> 00:35:40,416
Stars going to to thank you for what you do

812
00:35:40,928 --> 00:35:41,952
You're my hero

813
00:35:42,208 --> 00:35:43,488
A bondsman to say that

814
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,280
Really nervous. Apologize

815
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:47,840
I have a 2 month old son

816
00:35:49,376 --> 00:35:50,400
Our first child

817
00:35:51,168 --> 00:35:52,192
And he's about to get

818
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:53,472
Richard

819
00:35:54,496 --> 00:35:55,008
Schedule

820
00:35:56,288 --> 00:35:58,080
Vaccines and stuff like that

821
00:36:01,152 --> 00:36:04,736
Schedule to get on trains and get the f***

822
00:36:06,272 --> 00:36:08,064
What's your schedule

823
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:10,880
Your time to ride the carousel in Logan's Run

824
00:36:13,696 --> 00:36:18,304
Just cuz they say it's scheduled

825
00:36:20,096 --> 00:36:24,192
I think so I'm not real sure I let me do it more in the hospital

826
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:25,728
Roof

827
00:36:27,264 --> 00:36:27,776
So that's

828
00:36:28,032 --> 00:36:28,800
Atone

829
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:30,080
He was coming at the

830
00:36:30,336 --> 00:36:33,664
This caller with the colors you're saying that the schedule 2/2

831
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:38,528
Keynesian

832
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:42,624
They were scheduled you know I really like not having measles

833
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:49,024
And I I think I might childhood was better for not having measles

834
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:51,072
Great

835
00:36:51,328 --> 00:36:52,096
To not have polio

836
00:36:52,352 --> 00:36:53,120
And of course

837
00:36:53,376 --> 00:36:55,168
You died of the whooping cough

838
00:36:55,424 --> 00:36:56,448
Yeah well that was

839
00:36:56,704 --> 00:37:00,544
That was a struggle

840
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,336
I think that's great but

841
00:37:02,848 --> 00:37:04,640
17 of your siblings died of tetanus

842
00:37:04,896 --> 00:37:05,920
Doesn't it seem like

843
00:37:06,176 --> 00:37:08,224
That should be an easier sell

844
00:37:08,736 --> 00:37:09,248
What hey

845
00:37:09,504 --> 00:37:11,552
You know how we don't have polio

846
00:37:11,808 --> 00:37:12,832
That's because of the vaccine

847
00:37:13,344 --> 00:37:15,648
So just because of hand-washing

848
00:37:15,904 --> 00:37:16,416
Or something

849
00:37:16,672 --> 00:37:17,440
That really bother

850
00:37:17,696 --> 00:37:23,840
Really bothers me the f****** witches in people being good for a while or when I left

851
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:26,912
So

852
00:37:27,936 --> 00:37:30,240
To see the way this town were

853
00:37:30,496 --> 00:37:34,080
Restart the call and the guy just says it is getting scheduled

854
00:37:34,336 --> 00:37:35,104
Immediately

855
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:37,152
He Compares it to trains in the haluk

856
00:37:37,408 --> 00:37:38,176
Call Rye Rye

857
00:37:38,688 --> 00:37:41,504
Penny he tries to sort of play reasonable

858
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:42,272
A little bit

859
00:37:44,832 --> 00:37:46,880
A decision you have to make

860
00:37:47,392 --> 00:37:52,768
Now the Japanese it's got to be more than what are we doing

861
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:53,792
Because they

862
00:37:54,048 --> 00:37:55,328
Found completely that

863
00:37:55,584 --> 00:37:58,656
This stuff cause the neurological problems autoimmune problem

864
00:37:59,168 --> 00:38:01,728
But it's much worse when I was a little bitty baby

865
00:38:01,984 --> 00:38:07,104
Has all the shots

866
00:38:07,616 --> 00:38:08,640
It won't stunt them

867
00:38:08,896 --> 00:38:13,248
Tonight Alex is trying to play that hey everybody's got to make their own decision

868
00:38:13,504 --> 00:38:17,344
And then immediately jumps to the story about Japan which is a complete lie

869
00:38:17,856 --> 00:38:23,744
In 1994 Japan amended the law that they had they have a law that made vaccines mandatory

870
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,536
Demanded this making instead

871
00:38:25,792 --> 00:38:29,376
It was more of a civic duty than a strict legal obligation

872
00:38:29,632 --> 00:38:30,656
According to the aafp

873
00:38:31,168 --> 00:38:32,704
The World Health Organization stats

874
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:36,032
2018 reflective vaccination rate of 99%

875
00:38:36,288 --> 00:38:37,312
For tetanus diphtheria

876
00:38:37,568 --> 00:38:41,920
Pertussis in 1 year old Japanese children in 97% for the same age group

877
00:38:42,176 --> 00:38:42,944
With the polio vaccine

878
00:38:43,712 --> 00:38:48,064
Making s*** up to demonize vaccination put it's important to pay attention to that

879
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,856
That way that he's trying to frame thing

880
00:38:50,368 --> 00:38:51,904
You know what you did

881
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:53,696
The color brings this up

882
00:38:54,464 --> 00:38:59,072
Comparison to the Holocaust everybody's got to make the wrong decision but also here's a lie about Japanese

883
00:38:59,328 --> 00:39:00,864
People okay so if

884
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:03,424
99% 97 percentage Avenue

885
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:04,448
These babies

886
00:39:04,704 --> 00:39:05,472
We can look back and

887
00:39:05,728 --> 00:39:06,240
And see if

888
00:39:06,496 --> 00:39:07,776
His numbers makes

889
00:39:08,288 --> 00:39:08,800
25 years

890
00:39:09,056 --> 00:39:09,568
Later whatever

891
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:11,616
They don't sell

892
00:39:11,872 --> 00:39:12,896
Can't we be done then

893
00:39:13,152 --> 00:39:18,016
But we can't because Alex is now because Alex has said

894
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:19,808
Everybody needs to make up their online

895
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:22,368
We have the proof

896
00:39:22,624 --> 00:39:24,672
Concert from Japan

897
00:39:24,928 --> 00:39:29,536
Look a got to make up their own mind I'll call her this caller is still on the line

898
00:39:30,304 --> 00:39:33,888
This is f***** up this is not what you do when you want someone to make up their own mind

899
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,424
Answer your question

900
00:39:36,704 --> 00:39:39,264
Yeah I really really appreciate that and I appreciate your time

901
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:42,592
I guess I'm just not going to do what I mean I mean

902
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:49,504
The winner he comes over enough to go to school and then with that will that be a problem

903
00:39:56,416 --> 00:39:57,184
It out in the open

904
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:59,744
Now they say Okay Mercury there is good for you

905
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:07,168
And you say I know you got the waiver

906
00:40:07,424 --> 00:40:09,472
It's not even law but it's a waiver to a non law

907
00:40:12,288 --> 00:40:13,568
So they make a list of

908
00:40:15,872 --> 00:40:16,640
Not even do that

909
00:40:20,992 --> 00:40:22,016
I'm from the feds

910
00:40:22,272 --> 00:40:23,808
The Federal

911
00:40:24,576 --> 00:40:28,416
97%

912
00:40:32,512 --> 00:40:36,352
And then you can already have Google.

913
00:40:36,608 --> 00:40:37,376
Tennessee

914
00:40:37,888 --> 00:40:38,656
Vaccine

915
00:40:38,912 --> 00:40:39,424
Waiver

916
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:41,472
Conscientious objector religious objector

917
00:40:41,728 --> 00:40:43,264
And you can go really principal

918
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:44,288
Or assistant principal

919
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,592
Here's to waiver for Tennessee

920
00:40:47,616 --> 00:40:48,896
You lied to me

921
00:40:49,408 --> 00:40:52,480
And so you'll know you're there with a hardcore liar

922
00:40:52,736 --> 00:40:57,344
Entire government corporate system train

923
00:40:59,136 --> 00:41:01,440
Any teachers take their kids and injected with a

924
00:41:02,464 --> 00:41:06,304
And they love the fact that many stools a third of the school down special ad

925
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:08,608
How's the children

926
00:41:08,864 --> 00:41:13,472
Football helmet literally

927
00:41:15,008 --> 00:41:19,360
Kaiser belt

928
00:41:19,872 --> 00:41:24,480
And they loved it they just love all that and soon the whole school beats in the corner drooling

929
00:41:28,576 --> 00:41:29,344
Savagely

930
00:41:33,184 --> 00:41:38,816
Make a cement and then just come in and had two helicopters fly over and spray gas and kill everybody

931
00:41:39,072 --> 00:41:40,352
Everybody ready for that

932
00:41:42,912 --> 00:41:44,704
Those are criminals

933
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:47,264

F****** bad you

938
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:06,207
They're trying to kill you and I love

939
00:42:06,463 --> 00:42:12,351
Book everybody's got their own choice between getting murdered in their own bed and being a heroic patriot who gives me money

940
00:42:15,423 --> 00:42:20,031
Episode of Big Show

941
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:20,799
That would have made

942
00:42:22,847 --> 00:42:24,127
Oh well we get another caller

943
00:42:24,383 --> 00:42:25,663
This is just for good clean

944
00:42:26,175 --> 00:42:26,943
There's a little bit of parsley

945
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:31,551
JFK documentary

946
00:42:31,807 --> 00:42:35,135
And then we find that Alex doesn't know a variable

947
00:42:35,647 --> 00:42:36,927
Bit of trivia about JFK

948
00:42:37,183 --> 00:42:40,255
Now he he fancies himself kind of like a guy Knows Alot About That

949
00:42:40,511 --> 00:42:41,535
Conspiracy

950
00:42:41,791 --> 00:42:43,071
The conspiracy guy

951
00:42:44,607 --> 00:42:45,887
Kind of rough that he doesn't know the

952
00:42:46,911 --> 00:42:47,423
Kind of a big one

953
00:42:47,935 --> 00:42:50,239
Incredible deep deep you should watch

954
00:42:50,495 --> 00:42:53,311
It's revealing even some of the attorneys that were defending

955
00:42:55,871 --> 00:42:57,151
Date the guy who took over JFK's

956
00:42:57,663 --> 00:42:58,431
Nakia members name

957
00:42:58,943 --> 00:43:00,991
When heat when they assassinated him

958
00:43:01,503 --> 00:43:02,783
Who is the who's an expert

959
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:04,063
Vice president who took over

960
00:43:06,367 --> 00:43:08,671
Well it was it was Robert Kennedy

961
00:43:09,439 --> 00:43:09,951
What

962
00:43:10,975 --> 00:43:12,767
Of course

963
00:43:14,047 --> 00:43:15,071
Who is JFK's Vice

964
00:43:15,327 --> 00:43:16,095
President

965
00:43:16,351 --> 00:43:18,399
I'm having a moment your I should know that

966
00:43:18,655 --> 00:43:23,775
Yeah you should f****** know

967
00:43:24,799 --> 00:43:25,311
Is a big part of the

968
00:43:25,567 --> 00:43:31,711
The reason is my God is probably one of the bigger

969
00:43:31,967 --> 00:43:32,991
List reasons that Alex

970
00:43:33,247 --> 00:43:36,831
Hateful left anyways hope it's because of LBJ that we got the

971
00:43:37,087 --> 00:43:38,111
Civil Rights Act

972
00:43:38,367 --> 00:43:40,415
Because of him he fought to

973
00:43:40,671 --> 00:43:41,439
To The Nail for a long time

974
00:43:42,463 --> 00:43:45,279
The part of the actual

975
00:43:45,535 --> 00:43:50,911
Eventually remember LBJ couldn't come up with

976
00:43:51,935 --> 00:43:52,959
Who was lbj's vice

977
00:43:53,215 --> 00:43:53,983
President

978
00:43:54,495 --> 00:43:56,543
Wow buddy how did that

979
00:43:56,799 --> 00:44:00,127
Take like a little bit of a second

980
00:44:00,383 --> 00:44:01,407
But like that's too long

981
00:44:01,919 --> 00:44:03,711
Yeah and especially for LBJ

982
00:44:03,967 --> 00:44:06,527
Who is kind of a big figure in America

983
00:44:07,807 --> 00:44:09,855
Figure 8 JFK assassination

984
00:44:12,159 --> 00:44:12,671
Totally

985
00:44:13,183 --> 00:44:13,695
In fact

986
00:44:13,951 --> 00:44:15,231
One of the many people sis

987
00:44:15,743 --> 00:44:18,047
Murder

988
00:44:18,303 --> 00:44:19,583
Definitely

989
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:20,607
Weird

990
00:44:20,863 --> 00:44:22,911
So now we get to the point of the episode where

991
00:44:23,167 --> 00:44:24,191
We get the introduction

992
00:44:24,447 --> 00:44:25,727
Of Joseph Road

993
00:44:26,239 --> 00:44:27,007
And Edward Bravo

994
00:44:27,263 --> 00:44:27,775
Call boy

995
00:44:29,823 --> 00:44:32,127
It's interesting they were different back then

996
00:44:32,383 --> 00:44:33,151
Well maybe not

997
00:44:33,407 --> 00:44:34,431
Joe's definitely High

998
00:44:38,271 --> 00:44:39,807
This is really awkward

999
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:41,599
Awkward

1000
00:44:42,367 --> 00:44:47,999
Well it's good having you here it was good seeing you last night either so much to talk about obviously Joe Rogan of Newsradio

1001
00:44:48,255 --> 00:44:49,791
Fear Factor The Man Show

1002
00:44:50,303 --> 00:44:53,375
Obelisk goes on and on UFC Ultimate Fighting Championship

1003
00:44:54,655 --> 00:44:59,519
Pretty much since the start haven't you I started working for the UFC in 1997

1004
00:44:59,775 --> 00:45:00,543
The post-fight interview

1005
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:03,103
13 years

1006
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:04,127
Yeah it's been a long time

1007
00:45:05,407 --> 00:45:07,967
I remember like an I-9

1008
00:45:08,479 --> 00:45:11,039
Madness UFC's going to be

1009
00:45:12,831 --> 00:45:15,647
You're crazy

1010
00:45:16,927 --> 00:45:17,439
What's now

1011
00:45:17,695 --> 00:45:18,207
Giant

1012
00:45:18,463 --> 00:45:19,231
Austin Texas

1013
00:45:21,023 --> 00:45:21,535
Frontier

1014
00:45:23,327 --> 00:45:26,143
You know when I was with Ventura last week one of the guys from the

1015
00:45:26,399 --> 00:45:29,215
Company that do stuff for UFC was there he was going every Brock Lesnar

1016
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:30,495
Right after that one

1017
00:45:32,287 --> 00:45:34,079
I told rocks back bigger than ever huh

1018
00:45:34,335 --> 00:45:35,359
Yeah

1019
00:45:36,127 --> 00:45:37,919
That's great it's not as Electric

1020
00:45:38,175 --> 00:45:41,759
As some of this present day stuff and I think it's cuz I would

1021
00:45:42,015 --> 00:45:42,527
Texas sober

1022
00:45:47,135 --> 00:45:52,511
A Berkeley different chemistry Grease the wheels on this

1023
00:45:52,767 --> 00:45:55,583
Remind me to be some grease on these wheels that's awesome

1024
00:45:56,351 --> 00:45:57,631
Holy Ship

1025
00:45:57,887 --> 00:46:04,031
S*** this is not what I expected

1026
00:46:07,103 --> 00:46:08,895
Alex is sitting here with

1027
00:46:09,151 --> 00:46:09,919
Eddie and Joe

1028
00:46:10,175 --> 00:46:11,711
All of the human

1029
00:46:11,967 --> 00:46:12,479
Elements

1030
00:46:12,735 --> 00:46:14,527
Are there for the

1031
00:46:15,295 --> 00:46:20,415
Record-setting most listened to podcast ever

1032
00:46:20,671 --> 00:46:24,255
Edmonton the sequel

1033
00:46:24,511 --> 00:46:25,791
Eddie it is just

1034
00:46:26,303 --> 00:46:28,095
Trashy I got to be drunk

1035
00:46:28,351 --> 00:46:29,887
You got to be in Rogan's house

1036
00:46:30,143 --> 00:46:32,703
Cindy got to be a half of a fifth through

1037
00:46:32,959 --> 00:46:33,727
I think there's some funny

1038
00:46:33,983 --> 00:46:35,263
Stuff to get into energy

1039
00:46:35,775 --> 00:46:38,847
Really gigantic live at Alex Telles

1040
00:46:39,103 --> 00:46:42,431
But this is a case of me getting it on my own

1041
00:46:42,687 --> 00:46:43,199
Petard

1042
00:46:43,455 --> 00:46:45,503
I legitimately thought it would be fun

1043
00:46:47,551 --> 00:46:48,063
Kind of

1044
00:46:50,623 --> 00:46:51,135
It's not it's a

1045
00:46:51,391 --> 00:46:53,695
Define interview for the most part

1046
00:46:53,951 --> 00:46:54,719
Like broken

1047
00:46:54,975 --> 00:46:55,999
Hi

1048
00:46:56,255 --> 00:46:58,559
Pencil like Alex is talking about like all we're talking

1049
00:46:58,815 --> 00:47:00,351
Last night you told me something really interesting

1050
00:47:00,607 --> 00:47:03,167
And it's clearly that Rogan was like trying to spit

1051
00:47:03,423 --> 00:47:05,215
Football maybe who's working on a joke

1052
00:47:05,471 --> 00:47:09,311
Or something as like a real point

1053
00:47:09,823 --> 00:47:12,383
That I thought were

1054
00:47:12,895 --> 00:47:13,407
Right on

1055
00:47:16,479 --> 00:47:16,991
The red button

1056
00:47:17,247 --> 00:47:22,623
You're talking about how that I believe that

1057
00:47:22,879 --> 00:47:24,415
All human behavior is not

1058
00:47:24,671 --> 00:47:30,815
Just like I believe that all animal behaviors natural

1059
00:47:31,583 --> 00:47:33,887
Humans are far more complex but

1060
00:47:34,143 --> 00:47:38,239
We don't think of ourselves as being natural that we're moving a natural Direct

1061
00:47:38,751 --> 00:47:42,079
And I think that June things in a human society especially with

1062
00:47:42,591 --> 00:47:44,639
Technology I think we create

1063
00:47:45,151 --> 00:47:46,943
We create technology and

1064
00:47:47,199 --> 00:47:47,967
That's what we're here for

1065
00:47:48,223 --> 00:47:50,783
And it's very possible that we human beings are here for

1066
00:47:51,039 --> 00:47:54,367
Is to make some new reality make some new

1067
00:47:54,623 --> 00:47:57,439
Technological innovation that's going to change the world and egg

1068
00:47:57,695 --> 00:47:58,463
Could could be

1069
00:47:58,719 --> 00:48:01,791
A big bang machine it could be a time machine it could be

1070
00:48:02,047 --> 00:48:02,815
Just some

1071
00:48:03,327 --> 00:48:04,607
In in in

1072
00:48:04,863 --> 00:48:05,887
Incredible

1073
00:48:06,399 --> 00:48:12,543
Discovery something they're going to invent eventually maybe keep going with things like the Large Hadron Collider then I going to stop there

1074
00:48:12,799 --> 00:48:16,127
Use whatever findings that they get for the Large Hadron Collider

1075
00:48:16,383 --> 00:48:17,407
If it doesn't blow up the world

1076
00:48:17,663 --> 00:48:23,807
And they're going to try the next thing

1077
00:48:24,063 --> 00:48:27,903
The joke is that we're here to make the big bang

1078
00:48:28,159 --> 00:48:33,791
Every fifteen billion years these intelligent monkeys get to a point where they break down matter and try to figure out what

1079
00:48:34,047 --> 00:48:37,631
What is at the center of the universe

1080
00:48:37,887 --> 00:48:38,911
Restart all over again

1081
00:48:40,191 --> 00:48:41,215
Just speculation

1082
00:48:41,471 --> 00:48:42,495
Wow

1083
00:48:43,263 --> 00:48:43,775
Wow

1084
00:48:44,543 --> 00:48:45,823
Heavy man

1085
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:47,359
MattyB

1086
00:48:47,871 --> 00:48:54,015
I think I think Douglas Adams put it better that if the question and the answer we're ever known than the

1087
00:48:54,271 --> 00:48:56,319
Will be destroyed and replaced by something weirder

1088
00:48:56,575 --> 00:48:57,343
Is a lot

1089
00:48:57,599 --> 00:48:58,623
Simpler insurance

1090
00:49:00,415 --> 00:49:03,487
That kind of a thing is like yeah I could imagine getting high with

1091
00:49:03,743 --> 00:49:04,255
Someone

1092
00:49:04,767 --> 00:49:08,863
Like a lot of the people I knew in college and have an almost identical conversation 100

1093
00:49:09,375 --> 00:49:10,143
There's something wrong with the

1094
00:49:10,399 --> 00:49:13,983
Simulation Theory

1095
00:49:14,495 --> 00:49:16,031
Buying place for Jodha exist

1096
00:49:16,287 --> 00:49:22,431
Older brother who's into weed

1097
00:49:22,687 --> 00:49:24,223
Only stolen a few beers

1098
00:49:24,479 --> 00:49:27,807
Sure at this point

1099
00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:28,831
Goodbye in Spanish

1100
00:49:31,135 --> 00:49:32,415
Can be useful in people's lives like

1101
00:49:32,671 --> 00:49:38,559
I can open up the you're at your brain to nuvista

1102
00:49:38,815 --> 00:49:39,327
It's just not

1103
00:49:39,583 --> 00:49:41,631
That deep a minute also

1104
00:49:42,143 --> 00:49:42,911
Clearly

1105
00:49:43,167 --> 00:49:45,983
You can tell the Joe was talking about this as some kind of like a knife

1106
00:49:46,239 --> 00:49:47,519
Idea

1107
00:49:48,031 --> 00:49:50,335
Has the structure of a Rogan

1108
00:49:51,103 --> 00:49:52,639
Yeah it has the structure of something you could

1109
00:49:52,895 --> 00:49:53,919
See him doing on stage

1110
00:49:55,455 --> 00:49:55,967
Alex Isley

1111
00:49:56,479 --> 00:49:56,991
Yeah bad

1112
00:49:57,247 --> 00:49:58,271
0 it is at 8

1113
00:49:58,527 --> 00:50:03,135
Big idea that humans are

1114
00:50:04,415 --> 00:50:07,487
Not being able to parse out do you like reality and

1115
00:50:08,767 --> 00:50:10,815
You can't have jokes if you don't realize the

1116
00:50:11,071 --> 00:50:12,607
The transgression over reality

1117
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:14,399
Start wise humor is Soto

1118
00:50:15,423 --> 00:50:16,447
Alex now gets the train

1119
00:50:16,703 --> 00:50:17,983
Plug some Eddie Bravo

1120
00:50:18,239 --> 00:50:19,263
Jiu jitsu

1121
00:50:20,543 --> 00:50:22,079
Got both of you found out your website

1122
00:50:23,103 --> 00:50:23,871
Joe Rogan. Net

1123
00:50:25,407 --> 00:50:25,919
Ajj

1124
00:50:28,479 --> 00:50:29,503
Change to jitsu

1125
00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:31,039
Dot-com

1126
00:50:33,343 --> 00:50:35,135
Stuff everywhere

1127
00:50:36,927 --> 00:50:37,695
10th Planet stubborn

1128
00:50:42,815 --> 00:50:44,351
25 I think

1129
00:50:48,703 --> 00:50:49,727
Jiu jitsu teachers

1130
00:50:49,983 --> 00:50:52,031
So I'll say yes

1131
00:50:52,799 --> 00:50:55,871
He's one of the most Innovative and

1132
00:50:56,127 --> 00:50:56,895
Importance of Justice charge

1133
00:50:58,175 --> 00:51:00,223
Probably be asked is my best friend but it really is true

1134
00:51:00,479 --> 00:51:01,759
He's

1135
00:51:02,015 --> 00:51:02,527
Important

1136
00:51:03,551 --> 00:51:06,623
Weed and comes up with crazy to get to Moses

1137
00:51:06,879 --> 00:51:07,391
Turns out they work

1138
00:51:08,159 --> 00:51:09,695
And I'm also known as

1139
00:51:14,815 --> 00:51:15,583
There's freaking me

1140
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:17,375
Eddie sounds like

1141
00:51:17,887 --> 00:51:18,655
Kind of fun

1142
00:51:22,495 --> 00:51:25,311
I'm here

1143
00:51:26,847 --> 00:51:27,359
Proceeding as

1144
00:51:28,639 --> 00:51:30,431
Energy is off

1145
00:51:30,687 --> 00:51:31,455
It seems like

1146
00:51:32,223 --> 00:51:34,527
Eddie or Alex should have just been like

1147
00:51:34,783 --> 00:51:35,295
Let's do some

1148
00:51:35,807 --> 00:51:36,319
Conspiracy theory

1149
00:51:36,575 --> 00:51:38,111
What we're here for

1150
00:51:38,367 --> 00:51:42,719
To push in that direction but Alex can't because no one

1151
00:51:42,975 --> 00:51:44,255
If you got to talk to

1152
00:51:44,511 --> 00:51:45,279
Pidgeotto

1153
00:51:45,791 --> 00:51:47,071
The big star whatever

1154
00:51:48,863 --> 00:51:49,887
It's more of that like

1155
00:51:50,655 --> 00:51:51,423
He's not f*****-up

1156
00:51:51,679 --> 00:51:52,191
And he doesn't want it

1157
00:51:53,471 --> 00:51:55,775
I just think it's that he left it too weird

1158
00:51:56,031 --> 00:51:56,799
Yes

1159
00:51:57,055 --> 00:51:59,103
I just looked it up it turns out that

1160
00:51:59,359 --> 00:52:00,383
Podcast

1161
00:52:01,663 --> 00:52:02,687
Started in December

1162
00:52:02,943 --> 00:52:03,711
2009

1163
00:52:03,967 --> 00:52:04,479
So he's almost

1164
00:52:04,735 --> 00:52:05,247
Herein

1165
00:52:05,759 --> 00:52:06,271
The Rogan

1166
00:52:06,527 --> 00:52:07,295
Inexperienced

1167
00:52:08,063 --> 00:52:08,831
Yeah

1168
00:52:09,087 --> 00:52:11,903
So Alex is talking about

1169
00:52:12,159 --> 00:52:14,463
Eddie wants to know

1170
00:52:14,975 --> 00:52:15,743
About the

1171
00:52:15,999 --> 00:52:16,511
Troops

1172
00:52:17,023 --> 00:52:17,791
And they like

1173
00:52:18,047 --> 00:52:18,815
Drug trade

1174
00:52:19,327 --> 00:52:20,607
Opium in Afghanistan

1175
00:52:20,863 --> 00:52:21,631
Okay okay

1176
00:52:22,143 --> 00:52:24,959
One of his one of his like

1177
00:52:25,727 --> 00:52:29,055
Money I'll text Emily make money selling drugs

1178
00:52:29,311 --> 00:52:33,151
How was the actual process for

1179
00:52:33,407 --> 00:52:34,943
We never do get an answer on

1180
00:52:35,199 --> 00:52:35,711
Well.

1181
00:52:37,247 --> 00:52:38,783
I think it's fascinating because

1182
00:52:39,039 --> 00:52:40,319
Is it is the behavior that

1183
00:52:40,575 --> 00:52:41,855
That you see on the Joe Rogan

1184
00:52:42,111 --> 00:52:44,159
. whenever Alex is a guest

1185
00:52:44,415 --> 00:52:46,975
Being carried out by Joe

1186
00:52:47,231 --> 00:52:48,255
11 years prior

1187
00:52:49,023 --> 00:52:53,119
It's flowing out and the US troops protect the opium

1188
00:52:55,679 --> 00:53:01,567
At and no no no I'm serious I play a clip of Fox News Geraldo sing out patriotic

1189
00:53:03,103 --> 00:53:06,175
You think I'm joking

1190
00:53:12,575 --> 00:53:13,599
So he calls them on

1191
00:53:14,111 --> 00:53:14,879
Recalls

1192
00:53:15,135 --> 00:53:16,159
Alex on this

1193
00:53:16,415 --> 00:53:17,183
Show me this video

1194
00:53:18,207 --> 00:53:20,511
So they start playing the clip

1195
00:53:20,767 --> 00:53:22,303
But Joe and Eddie don't have headphones

1196
00:53:24,607 --> 00:53:25,887
How did the Americans get paid

1197
00:53:26,143 --> 00:53:26,655
For the opium

1198
00:53:26,911 --> 00:53:27,679
That's what I'm saying

1199
00:53:28,191 --> 00:53:28,959
It gets

1200
00:53:30,239 --> 00:53:32,287
Rivera

1201
00:53:32,543 --> 00:53:33,055
Coherent

1202
00:53:33,823 --> 00:53:35,103
Headphones on

1203
00:53:42,271 --> 00:53:42,783
North or

1204
00:53:46,367 --> 00:53:46,879
Position

1205
00:53:47,391 --> 00:53:51,231
I don't know if he was the one who had the

1206
00:53:51,487 --> 00:53:53,023
Zapruder film first on television

1207
00:53:53,279 --> 00:53:56,607
The word is he knows all about this stuff

1208
00:53:57,887 --> 00:54:03,775
What are arabica helping them grow the opium

1209
00:54:04,031 --> 00:54:05,823
Eliezer

1210
00:54:06,335 --> 00:54:06,847
What

1211
00:54:07,359 --> 00:54:09,407
Here's the actual clip but Alex is talking about

1212
00:54:21,951 --> 00:54:23,999
Innocent victim

1213
00:54:28,863 --> 00:54:31,935
And we are tolerating it

1214
00:54:32,191 --> 00:54:35,775
Abby opium speakers

1215
00:54:36,031 --> 00:54:38,847
The population would turn against them

1216
00:54:39,103 --> 00:54:40,383
Security risk

1217
00:54:40,639 --> 00:54:41,919
Lieutenant Colonel Bryan Christmas

1218
00:54:42,175 --> 00:54:43,711
The commanding officer of the Third

1219
00:54:43,967 --> 00:54:44,735
6 Marines

1220
00:54:51,391 --> 00:54:56,255
Contradiction

1221
00:55:02,655 --> 00:55:07,263
What are you doing about your culture

1222
00:55:07,519 --> 00:55:13,151
So well my grind in my gut and it's what they do we provide them security

1223
00:55:20,831 --> 00:55:26,207
About giving them seed and fertilizer something about alternative crops

1224
00:55:27,487 --> 00:55:29,023
Can grow instead of poppy but

1225
00:55:30,047 --> 00:55:31,071
Taking all of their

1226
00:55:31,583 --> 00:55:32,863
They're popular destroying the field

1227
00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:33,887
Wouldn't be productive

1228
00:55:34,143 --> 00:55:35,167
Go to the mission then

1229
00:55:35,423 --> 00:55:36,191
He's trying to undertake

1230
00:55:37,471 --> 00:55:39,263
What's goes to Commercial and he shows

1231
00:55:41,567 --> 00:55:43,103
Presumably Jose seen it

1232
00:55:43,871 --> 00:55:45,407
Zebra too dumb

1233
00:55:47,711 --> 00:55:48,991
Completely edited version of it

1234
00:55:50,527 --> 00:55:53,087
A fascinating piece of video footage with Geraldo Rivera

1235
00:55:53,343 --> 00:55:55,903
In-N-Out in the poppy store

1236
00:55:56,159 --> 00:55:56,927
The poppy fields and

1237
00:55:58,207 --> 00:56:01,535
Acting up and providing them fertilizer and helping them grow it

1238
00:56:01,791 --> 00:56:02,559
I mean

1239
00:56:02,815 --> 00:56:03,327
Rideable

1240
00:56:03,839 --> 00:56:04,351
I'm it's

1241
00:56:04,863 --> 00:56:06,655
Outrageous if you go and actually watch

1242
00:56:06,911 --> 00:56:08,447
Today's like the context of it is really

1243
00:56:20,223 --> 00:56:21,247
The Opium sap

1244
00:56:23,039 --> 00:56:29,183
The plant and I watched everyone that was for sale

1245
00:56:35,839 --> 00:56:41,983
Cotton watermelon cucumber it's all great stuff they grow out here. We just want to see that that come to

1246
00:56:45,055 --> 00:56:47,359
Completely outer to the contacts that Alex

1247
00:56:47,615 --> 00:56:49,919
Is describing it in and it's also counter

1248
00:56:50,175 --> 00:56:50,687
Contacts

1249
00:56:50,943 --> 00:56:51,967
But Joe is been convinced.

1250
00:56:52,223 --> 00:56:57,087
We want to see the puppy go away is a very hard sentence to avoid when you're art

1251
00:56:58,111 --> 00:56:59,903
They're helping them grow it

1252
00:57:00,159 --> 00:57:06,047
Specifically in the fertilizer and when you look at the eclipse

1253
00:57:06,815 --> 00:57:09,631
Specifically seed and fertilizer in the contacts exactly

1254
00:57:09,887 --> 00:57:11,679
Other crops that can grow in

1255
00:57:14,239 --> 00:57:18,847
This behavior is so consistent throughout Joe Rogan career with Alex

1256
00:57:20,127 --> 00:57:20,895
I just don't

1257
00:57:21,151 --> 00:57:22,687
I can't believe that it

1258
00:57:22,943 --> 00:57:23,455
It's not

1259
00:57:24,735 --> 00:57:25,759
I don't know what to think about

1260
00:57:26,015 --> 00:57:27,039
Is it okay

1261
00:57:27,295 --> 00:57:29,343
Stop himself with being

1262
00:57:29,855 --> 00:57:30,367
Yeah

1263
00:57:30,623 --> 00:57:34,719
He's too credulous towards a guy who has been lying to him since they met

1264
00:57:35,231 --> 00:57:36,511
Doesn't

1265
00:57:36,767 --> 00:57:37,535
Video like

1266
00:57:38,815 --> 00:57:39,327
It's believable

1267
00:57:39,583 --> 00:57:42,399
No it's not it's not believable it's hard to it

1268
00:57:43,423 --> 00:57:46,239
I can't Square the idea that he is not in on it and some fat

1269
00:57:47,519 --> 00:57:50,591
At least a little bit

1270
00:57:50,847 --> 00:57:52,383
This level of being duped

1271
00:57:52,639 --> 00:57:53,151
Yeah

1272
00:57:54,687 --> 00:57:55,199
It's

1273
00:57:55,711 --> 00:57:56,479
Pathologic

1274
00:57:56,991 --> 00:57:57,503
Like it would

1275
00:57:57,759 --> 00:58:02,879
Have to show up in all of his other relationships

1276
00:58:03,135 --> 00:58:03,903
Advantage of him

1277
00:58:04,415 --> 00:58:06,207
Subway

1278
00:58:06,463 --> 00:58:07,231
Honestly I don't

1279
00:58:07,487 --> 00:58:08,255
I think that's

1280
00:58:08,767 --> 00:58:09,279
2

1281
00:58:09,791 --> 00:58:15,167
Unbelievable

1282
00:58:15,423 --> 00:58:19,519
You had Steven Crowder

1283
00:58:19,775 --> 00:58:22,591
Wasn't the molyneux on there all the time

1284
00:58:25,919 --> 00:58:27,455
I think there is a decent chance

1285
00:58:27,711 --> 00:58:30,783
It's that maybe he is pathologically gullible gullible

1286
00:58:31,295 --> 00:58:34,367
Open his relationships with the people like

1287
00:58:35,135 --> 00:58:36,159
The closer Folk

1288
00:58:36,415 --> 00:58:38,207
Looks like an Ari shaffir

1289
00:58:38,463 --> 00:58:39,487
Tom Segura

1290
00:58:40,255 --> 00:58:43,071
Bert Kreischer Comics hang around with other,

1291
00:58:43,327 --> 00:58:45,119
Next we don't know what you normal people are doing

1292
00:58:45,631 --> 00:58:51,775
We don't know what's going on with you guys you could say anything We're just trying to write B man I guess you got

1293
00:58:52,031 --> 00:58:53,823
Take comedians out of the

1294
00:58:54,335 --> 00:58:55,615
Out of the entire conversation

1295
00:58:55,871 --> 00:58:58,431
Is that the whole other world has seen a lawyer

1296
00:59:02,271 --> 00:59:05,343
Yeah I find it I find it difficult to believe that that

1297
00:59:05,599 --> 00:59:06,111
That's true though cuz

1298
00:59:07,391 --> 00:59:07,903
It would be

1299
00:59:08,159 --> 00:59:09,183
It would be something that I think

1300
00:59:09,439 --> 00:59:10,463
Think he would need to

1301
00:59:11,487 --> 00:59:16,351
Get therapy with electric made it to the point he's at he falls for this kind of s***

1302
00:59:16,607 --> 00:59:17,631
On a regular basis

1303
00:59:18,399 --> 00:59:19,423
I also do

1304
00:59:19,679 --> 00:59:20,191
1st and what

1305
00:59:20,447 --> 00:59:21,727
So special about Alex

1306
00:59:21,983 --> 00:59:24,799
Yeah that requires him to make excuses for decades

1307
00:59:25,311 --> 00:59:28,639
I know it does seem like he has like a weird

1308
00:59:29,151 --> 00:59:30,687
Appeal to Authority like hack

1309
00:59:30,943 --> 00:59:31,455
NM

1310
00:59:31,711 --> 00:59:33,759
We're if you just say something so

1311
00:59:34,015 --> 00:59:36,063
Confidently and you have like a

1312
00:59:36,319 --> 00:59:37,343
A group

1313
00:59:37,599 --> 00:59:38,111
People who

1314
00:59:38,367 --> 00:59:39,135
Tell Joe that

1315
00:59:39,391 --> 00:59:41,183
That you're at you're actually a very smart person

1316
00:59:41,695 --> 00:59:43,999
And then you just say something confidently Jose like wow

1317
00:59:44,255 --> 00:59:47,839
A lot of people

1318
00:59:48,351 --> 00:59:51,423
Please cool it does seem like there's that just

1319
00:59:51,679 --> 00:59:53,727
Oh okay well I heard this was cool

1320
00:59:53,983 --> 00:59:54,751
And this guy is

1321
00:59:55,007 --> 00:59:58,335
I told this guy super smart so I have to at least engage with it and then

1322
00:59:58,591 --> 00:59:59,615
It's too easy.

1323
00:59:59,871 --> 01:00:00,383
It's just

1324
01:00:00,639 --> 01:00:03,455
It's just remarkable to me to see the exact same

1325
01:00:03,711 --> 01:00:04,223
Dynamic

1326
01:00:04,479 --> 01:00:05,247
That happened

1327
01:00:05,759 --> 01:00:07,807
In these present-day podcast appearances

1328
01:00:08,319 --> 01:00:09,855
Being done to Rogan

1329
01:00:10,367 --> 01:00:11,135
In 2010

1330
01:00:11,391 --> 01:00:13,695
This lying about the context or something

1331
01:00:13,951 --> 01:00:15,487
Joe calls him on it

1332
01:00:15,999 --> 01:00:18,047
And then there's evidence proffered

1333
01:00:18,303 --> 01:00:19,071
Weather

1334
01:00:19,327 --> 01:00:19,839
The evidence

1335
01:00:20,095 --> 01:00:21,119
B given is

1336
01:00:21,375 --> 01:00:24,191
Selectively edited to the point where it only shows without

1337
01:00:24,447 --> 01:00:25,983
Usher

1338
01:00:26,495 --> 01:00:27,519
DC Zatanna

1339
01:00:27,775 --> 01:00:29,823
Except Alex's framing of it despite the

1340
01:00:30,847 --> 01:00:33,151
Right context that that's to the contrary

1341
01:00:33,407 --> 01:00:35,711
Whatever it is he's not equipped to deal with

1342
01:00:35,967 --> 01:00:37,247
The sort of people leaves

1343
01:00:37,503 --> 01:00:38,527
Clearly

1344
01:00:38,783 --> 01:00:42,367
And then I met you do and now of course it's got to be ten million times as hard

1345
01:00:42,623 --> 01:00:44,159
Because if you confront that

1346
01:00:44,415 --> 01:00:45,439
Reality now

1347
01:00:45,951 --> 01:00:46,463
Then you have to

1348
01:00:46,719 --> 01:00:47,231
To be like

1349
01:00:47,999 --> 01:00:49,023
Well for the past

1350
01:00:49,535 --> 01:00:50,559
30 years

1351
01:00:51,327 --> 01:00:53,887
This guy I have thought with my friend

1352
01:00:54,143 --> 01:00:54,911
Has been taken

1353
01:00:55,167 --> 01:00:58,239
Sweet piece of s*** liar to me that's almost like

1354
01:00:58,495 --> 01:01:04,639
You know you get that Nigerian prince email

1355
01:01:04,895 --> 01:01:05,663
Give $1,000

1356
01:01:11,551 --> 01:01:16,671
It's almost like Jose pot committed on not calling out Alex at this point

1357
01:01:16,927 --> 01:01:18,975
Pennywise sorry Joe

1358
01:01:19,231 --> 01:01:20,511
Dog did you grown up

1359
01:01:20,767 --> 01:01:21,791
Did you ever

1360
01:01:22,047 --> 01:01:23,839
I don't know if this is like sort of it.

1361
01:01:24,095 --> 01:01:24,607
That I had

1362
01:01:24,863 --> 01:01:25,375
It's more Universal

1363
01:01:25,887 --> 01:01:27,423
Bunch of National Geographic

1364
01:01:27,679 --> 01:01:28,447
Effects on the house

1365
01:01:28,703 --> 01:01:30,495
Tons of magazines National Geographic

1366
01:01:31,519 --> 01:01:33,311
Educational philosophy

1367
01:01:33,567 --> 01:01:35,615
Berkshire

1368
01:01:36,639 --> 01:01:37,663
Things about Florida

1369
01:01:37,919 --> 01:01:38,431
Preston

1370
01:01:38,687 --> 01:01:41,503
Animals dinosaurs

1371
01:01:41,759 --> 01:01:47,135
Is it National Geographic was too believed in Evolution for my household at the

1372
01:01:47,391 --> 01:01:47,903
The time itself

1373
01:01:48,159 --> 01:01:50,463
What did you know that Nat Geo is putting out a lot of

1374
01:01:50,719 --> 01:01:53,279
Cover-ups

1375
01:01:53,535 --> 01:01:54,047
Cover okay

1376
01:01:54,303 --> 01:01:55,583
Okay

1377
01:01:56,863 --> 01:01:58,399
Entrails

1378
01:01:58,911 --> 01:02:00,959
You know what it is Nat Geo put Southeast

1379
01:02:01,215 --> 01:02:06,591
Connect with the government

1380
01:02:06,847 --> 01:02:08,383
You've all heard about

1381
01:02:08,639 --> 01:02:11,455
How record numbers of missionary turn out to be CIA

1382
01:02:15,551 --> 01:02:18,111
National Geographic

1383
01:02:18,367 --> 01:02:24,511
Is a Eugenics organization and they are the highest level CIA front

1384
01:02:24,767 --> 01:02:25,279
Malarkey

1385
01:02:25,791 --> 01:02:28,607
A very good friend of mine his father is in the CIA

1386
01:02:28,863 --> 01:02:29,631
Cool

1387
01:02:29,887 --> 01:02:33,983
Okay my buddies dad is in the CIA so obviously met Geo is

1388
01:02:34,239 --> 01:02:35,775
The f****** higher-level

1389
01:02:38,079 --> 01:02:38,591
It's meaningless

1390
01:02:38,847 --> 01:02:44,991
But it's never substantiated in a high-level CIA operation

1391
01:02:45,247 --> 01:02:45,759
Highest level

1392
01:02:50,111 --> 01:02:51,647
Throw that out there and then 12

1393
01:02:51,903 --> 01:02:53,439
You guys are going to say this is malarkey

1394
01:02:53,695 --> 01:02:57,279
But my buddies dad is in the CIA

1395
01:02:57,791 --> 01:03:00,863
Sad Joe Biden stole Malarkey from Rogan

1396
01:03:01,119 --> 01:03:02,911
That's what he gave him a hundred million dollars for

1397
01:03:03,167 --> 01:03:03,679
Extra

1398
01:03:03,935 --> 01:03:05,471
So

1399
01:03:05,727 --> 01:03:07,263
Conspiracies that

1400
01:03:08,031 --> 01:03:08,543
You know

1401
01:03:09,055 --> 01:03:12,127
Doesn't seem to be on the Earth is flat

1402
01:03:13,151 --> 01:03:13,919
At least not yet

1403
01:03:14,175 --> 01:03:14,943
Right right

1404
01:03:15,199 --> 01:03:16,735
Actually that actually comes

1405
01:03:16,991 --> 01:03:17,759
2 point I want to make

1406
01:03:18,271 --> 01:03:20,063
I'm at is the Earth is flat

1407
01:03:20,831 --> 01:03:24,671
We were trying to get to this for a while okay I've been waiting for you

1408
01:03:24,927 --> 01:03:27,487
Sooner or later we discovered Asians off every year

1409
01:03:29,023 --> 01:03:29,791
Interested to see if like

1410
01:03:30,047 --> 01:03:32,607
You go back and you'd see the same conspiracies

1411
01:03:32,863 --> 01:03:35,167
But he's into in the present being floated in 20

1412
01:03:36,447 --> 01:03:39,263
If the Earth is flat now it was no less flat then

1413
01:03:41,055 --> 01:03:41,567
It's not like

1414
01:03:42,079 --> 01:03:44,895
These ideas weren't spiraling around in places on the entry

1415
01:03:45,151 --> 01:03:47,967
A recent phenomenon

1416
01:03:48,991 --> 01:03:50,527
I was going back

1417
01:03:51,039 --> 01:03:55,647
It's incredible there is not anything like Flat Earth stuff and part of the reason

1418
01:03:55,903 --> 01:03:57,183
That wasn't that popular

1419
01:03:57,439 --> 01:03:57,951
In 2010

1420
01:03:58,207 --> 01:04:00,511
It wasn't

1421
01:04:00,767 --> 01:04:03,071
And this is something that's important to understand about conspiracy

1422
01:04:03,327 --> 01:04:03,839
Theorists

1423
01:04:04,351 --> 01:04:06,911
They think that they are independent thinkers

1424
01:04:07,167 --> 01:04:08,447
And they think they're like

1425
01:04:08,703 --> 01:04:09,215
Really

1426
01:04:09,471 --> 01:04:10,495
Really digging into thread

1427
01:04:10,751 --> 01:04:12,799
Pill man they are the biggest f******

1428
01:04:13,055 --> 01:04:14,079
Can followers in the world

1429
01:04:15,103 --> 01:04:15,615
Things Are

1430
01:04:16,127 --> 01:04:16,895
Popular

1431
01:04:17,151 --> 01:04:18,431
And then they get into them

1432
01:04:18,687 --> 01:04:19,711
And then they like

1433
01:04:19,967 --> 01:04:20,991
Like nothing ever happened

1434
01:04:21,503 --> 01:04:22,015
And something else

1435
01:04:22,271 --> 01:04:23,039
To become popular

1436
01:04:23,295 --> 01:04:26,367
He said probably a Sandy Hook truther whenever that was popular

1437
01:04:26,623 --> 01:04:28,415
No it's a fashionable it's a fashion

1438
01:04:28,927 --> 01:04:30,463
Theories are fashion

1439
01:04:30,719 --> 01:04:34,047
And some things are aesthetically important to retain along the way

1440
01:04:34,303 --> 01:04:34,815
Much like

1441
01:04:35,071 --> 01:04:40,703
I may not listen to the Bosstones anymore but I'll still be a Bosstones fan until I die sure he's going to be a 9/11

1442
01:04:40,959 --> 01:04:42,239
Truther until he dyed his hair

1443
01:04:42,495 --> 01:04:44,287
But it's maybe not the most primary things

1444
01:04:44,543 --> 01:04:47,359
Need to talk about all the time

1445
01:04:47,615 --> 01:04:48,127
But if you can't

1446
01:04:48,383 --> 01:04:53,759
Your life always talking about 911 to be a piece of

1447
01:04:54,015 --> 01:04:54,527
Each of Our Guest

1448
01:04:55,551 --> 01:04:56,063
And I

1449
01:04:56,575 --> 01:04:58,879
I found that fascinating that is a kraut yeah

1450
01:04:59,391 --> 01:05:03,999
Of course you're into what you're into at the time that he's into it the time

1451
01:05:04,767 --> 01:05:06,047
Is it to Hurricane Katrina

1452
01:05:08,607 --> 01:05:09,375
What do you think about

1453
01:05:09,887 --> 01:05:10,911
The conspiracy theories about

1454
01:05:11,423 --> 01:05:13,471
Katrina being a controlled

1455
01:05:13,983 --> 01:05:15,519
Hurricane house the way it

1456
01:05:16,031 --> 01:05:21,663
Multiple top meteorologists said it had two eyes for a while and just sat there and didn't act like a normal hurricane

1457
01:05:21,919 --> 01:05:23,967
The father of weather weapons on

1458
01:05:24,223 --> 01:05:27,295
Was flying into Cyclones

1459
01:05:31,135 --> 01:05:37,279
Add a long story short

1460
01:05:37,535 --> 01:05:38,047
67

1461
01:05:42,143 --> 01:05:44,447
1967 Stanford Research Institute

1462
01:05:44,703 --> 01:05:48,799
Can create and control hurricane

1463
01:05:51,615 --> 01:05:52,127
So

1464
01:05:52,383 --> 01:05:52,895
Was

1465
01:05:53,151 --> 01:05:55,455
Weather weapon Horizon

1466
01:05:55,967 --> 01:05:56,735
We don't get back to this

1467
01:05:58,271 --> 01:05:59,551
It was or it wasn't

1468
01:06:02,111 --> 01:06:04,927
Cool yeah

1469
01:06:05,183 --> 01:06:06,719
Well let's see if

1470
01:06:07,231 --> 01:06:08,511
Katrina was Aiken

1471
01:06:08,767 --> 01:06:09,535
Controlled hurricane

1472
01:06:09,791 --> 01:06:12,095
Sent by whom would be the first question that isn't

1473
01:06:12,351 --> 01:06:15,935
An important first question we would assume the American government

1474
01:06:16,191 --> 01:06:19,519
Warrior or a foreign power

1475
01:06:19,775 --> 01:06:20,543
Follow y

1476
01:06:20,799 --> 01:06:22,847
Specifically where it was

1477
01:06:23,103 --> 01:06:27,199
Was attacked so then you got to say that it's a weapon I would assume

1478
01:06:28,223 --> 01:06:29,759
Another conspiracy to get

1479
01:06:30,015 --> 01:06:30,783
It's loaded with a comeback

1480
01:06:31,039 --> 01:06:32,063
Break is that the movie

1481
01:06:33,087 --> 01:06:34,623
Is meant to start a race war

1482
01:06:34,879 --> 01:06:35,391
Okay

1483
01:06:35,647 --> 01:06:38,463
So you believe that the movie Machete with Danny Trejo

1484
01:06:38,719 --> 01:06:44,607
Is by the government designed to fuel race war hero Mexican

1485
01:06:44,863 --> 01:06:46,143
Home Depot guy

1486
01:06:48,703 --> 01:06:49,983
Peter answers

1487
01:06:52,031 --> 01:06:52,543
Just just

1488
01:06:52,799 --> 01:06:53,311
Okay

1489
01:07:00,479 --> 01:07:01,247
Stop guys

1490
01:07:01,503 --> 01:07:02,015

1494
01:07:09,439 --> 01:07:13,279
So you and Alex

Explained that he is

1497
01:07:19,679 --> 01:07:20,703
Right

1498
01:07:20,959 --> 01:07:24,799
Certainly not to images on the radio I wouldn't put that one out there

1499
01:07:25,055 --> 01:07:31,199
I would put your business out like that better situation

1500
01:07:32,479 --> 01:07:36,575
Seems like whoever was on the button on the red button there

1501
01:07:36,831 --> 01:07:40,415
Yeah yeah big bang machine

1502
01:07:40,671 --> 01:07:43,487
Actual adults working for him instead of hiring teens

1503
01:07:43,999 --> 01:07:46,047
We have Alex

1504
01:07:46,303 --> 01:07:47,839
Sober trying to deal with doing a

1505
01:07:48,095 --> 01:07:48,607
Michelle that has X

1506
01:07:48,863 --> 01:07:49,375
CC rules

1507
01:07:50,143 --> 01:07:51,423
With two guys who are high

1508
01:07:51,679 --> 01:07:52,703
One of them

1509
01:07:52,959 --> 01:07:53,983
Clearly eluded

1510
01:07:54,239 --> 01:07:55,775
And unable to

1511
01:07:56,031 --> 01:07:56,543
What's the deal with AF

1512
01:07:57,823 --> 01:07:58,847
So he's been shamed

1513
01:07:59,103 --> 01:08:00,383
Teddy's been shamed a little bit

1514
01:08:00,639 --> 01:08:01,407
Received

1515
01:08:01,663 --> 01:08:02,175
The background

1516
01:08:02,687 --> 01:08:03,199
Wow joke

1517
01:08:03,455 --> 01:08:05,503
Complains about the governor of Arizona

1518
01:08:06,271 --> 01:08:11,135
Hilarious is that dumb lady that's running Arizona Jan whatever the hell her name is

1519
01:08:11,391 --> 01:08:13,183
Who's it the who's the governor of Arizona

1520
01:08:17,535 --> 01:08:18,559
That lady is so dumb

1521
01:08:18,815 --> 01:08:20,607
Dumb have you ever seen her on TV

1522
01:08:20,863 --> 01:08:23,423
Oh my God

1523
01:08:23,679 --> 01:08:24,191
Pause

1524
01:08:24,447 --> 01:08:25,983
Coupons like

1525
01:08:26,239 --> 01:08:27,519
Ten solid seconds

1526
01:08:27,775 --> 01:08:28,543
Said nothing

1527
01:08:28,799 --> 01:08:32,383
To make some stuff about people getting their heads cut off over in the Arizona

1528
01:08:32,639 --> 01:08:34,687
The Mexicans are coming over here and cutting people's heads off

1529
01:08:37,503 --> 01:08:38,527
Sounds like Alex

1530
01:08:43,391 --> 01:08:43,903
I don't think

1531
01:08:44,159 --> 01:08:45,439
Joe should be allowed to call

1532
01:08:46,975 --> 01:08:48,511
No

1533
01:08:50,303 --> 01:08:52,351
It's tough to hear

1534
01:08:52,607 --> 01:08:53,119
Yeah it's

1535
01:08:53,375 --> 01:08:55,423
It's interesting cuz Alex Len has to sort of

1536
01:08:55,679 --> 01:08:56,959
Rebuttal little bit

1537
01:08:57,215 --> 01:08:57,983
Because he is also

1538
01:08:58,495 --> 01:08:59,263
Quite xenophobia

1539
01:08:59,519 --> 01:09:03,103
He's trying to be at your cutting in on my racism here. There's a Republican

1540
01:09:04,895 --> 01:09:06,687
Is Benita have sort of at least a little bit of

1541
01:09:06,943 --> 01:09:07,711
The pushback

1542
01:09:10,015 --> 01:09:10,527
Sure

1543
01:09:11,039 --> 01:09:12,319
Element of Chaos

1544
01:09:13,087 --> 01:09:13,855
Let me know

1545
01:09:14,367 --> 01:09:16,927
I'm not a big fan of Joe knows if I hate

1546
01:09:17,183 --> 01:09:17,695
Superman

1547
01:09:17,951 --> 01:09:19,231
The movie

1548
01:09:20,511 --> 01:09:25,887

1549
01:09:26,143 --> 01:09:28,959

I'm a Mexican

1551
01:09:33,823 --> 01:09:36,127
Thelma said I wasn't the greatest whatever

1552
01:09:36,383 --> 01:09:38,431
Please try to get back to machete

1553
01:09:38,943 --> 01:09:40,223
Is that what we were doing

1554
01:09:40,479 --> 01:09:43,039
Superhero movies

1555
01:09:43,295 --> 01:09:43,807
Haha

1556
01:09:46,879 --> 01:09:48,159
Okay

1557
01:09:48,415 --> 01:09:53,535
Has Eddie goes on I think he's making actually a fairly decent point

1558
01:09:54,303 --> 01:09:55,583
And that is

1559
01:09:56,095 --> 01:09:58,655
You know what I as somebody of Mexican descent

1560
01:09:58,911 --> 01:09:59,679
Heritage

1561
01:10:00,191 --> 01:10:00,703
I

1562
01:10:00,959 --> 01:10:03,007
See Spider-Man

1563
01:10:03,263 --> 01:10:08,127
Gotta fly with Spider-Man with Batman

1564

I don't I don't see myself in these these Heroes and For Me Maybe machete

1565
01:10:14,015 --> 01:10:16,319
Is it somebody that I can see as

1566
01:10:17,599 --> 01:10:19,903
Not on eyes not nice enough to white people

1567
01:10:20,671 --> 01:10:24,767
Mexican you can't relate to Spider-Man

1568
01:10:25,023 --> 01:10:25,535
You know and then

1569
01:10:25,791 --> 01:10:26,559
And then

1570
01:10:26,815 --> 01:10:29,119
We're going to have dinner

1571
01:10:29,375 --> 01:10:31,935
We can have Mexican people we have nothing now we have something

1572
01:10:32,191 --> 01:10:34,751
Is Superman a white guy from another galaxy

1573
01:10:35,007 --> 01:10:36,543
Now we have, cheddar

1574
01:10:37,055 --> 01:10:37,823
You know premier

1575
01:10:38,079 --> 01:10:40,895
Felt like a Mexican scientist

1576
01:10:41,407 --> 01:10:47,551
Who you know who becomes something superhero hacks up Durango

1577
01:10:47,807 --> 01:10:48,575
People up with a

1578
01:10:48,831 --> 01:10:53,695
The axe that ridiculous long-haired cat

1579
01:10:54,207 --> 01:10:58,047
Let me tell you something the Mexicans I know that warned me about this film that run the production

1580
01:10:58,303 --> 01:11:00,863
What stereotype of Mexican

1581
01:11:01,119 --> 01:11:04,447
Working at Home Depot in wanting to kill Gringos

1582
01:11:14,175 --> 01:11:18,783
Hahaha

1583
01:11:19,039 --> 01:11:19,807
TextNow app

1584
01:11:20,319 --> 01:11:20,831
Yeah

1585
01:11:21,087 --> 01:11:22,879
I think he makes a fine point

1586
01:11:23,135 --> 01:11:24,415
Look for the most part of me I think

1587
01:11:24,927 --> 01:11:27,743
Acceptable point and I think Alex is playing at these essential he's just

1588
01:11:28,255 --> 01:11:31,839
I don't know why we can't be having superheroes who are nice

1589
01:11:37,727 --> 01:11:38,239
Hellboy

1590
01:11:38,495 --> 01:11:39,007
So

1591
01:11:39,263 --> 01:11:40,799
We get a really big revele

1592
01:11:41,823 --> 01:11:42,335
On this episode

1593
01:11:43,359 --> 01:11:43,871
What's up

1594
01:11:44,639 --> 01:11:45,407
Cliff Superman

1595
01:11:45,663 --> 01:11:49,503
Did I don't know KK's expansion efforts in His Radio serials

1596
01:11:50,271 --> 01:11:52,575
I don't know how the mainstream media

1597
01:11:52,831 --> 01:11:53,599
The MSM

1598
01:11:54,111 --> 01:11:55,135
Failed to pick up on

1599
01:11:55,647 --> 01:11:56,415
What could be

1600
01:11:56,671 --> 01:11:57,951
The largest story of our times

1601
01:11:58,207 --> 01:12:00,767
Okay and that is the Alex Jones knows how to mind

1602
01:12:01,023 --> 01:12:01,791
Control Birds

1603
01:12:02,559 --> 01:12:06,143
I've even tried this with birds around my house and things if I come out in

1604
01:12:06,399 --> 01:12:07,423
Put my mind the antenna

1605
01:12:08,447 --> 01:12:09,471
I'm going to kill that bird

1606
01:12:12,031 --> 01:12:13,567
But if you're just being out nice and friendly

1607
01:12:14,079 --> 01:12:15,615
LaBarge to sit there almost land on you

1608
01:12:15,871 --> 01:12:16,383
Your hand

1609
01:12:18,175 --> 01:12:20,479
Telepathic

1610
01:12:20,991 --> 01:12:25,087
Pick up on me to take this clip and use it and say Alex Jones

1611
01:12:25,343 --> 01:12:27,135
Uses mind control on birds

1612
01:12:27,391 --> 01:12:33,535
Probably will I have fulfilled the prophecy

1613
01:12:33,791 --> 01:12:34,559
Drawn Birds

1614
01:12:35,839 --> 01:12:40,703
I just have to play it to the bank you could not do it

1615
01:12:40,959 --> 01:12:43,263
It had to be a little bored

1616
01:12:45,055 --> 01:12:46,335
At this point like pigs

1617
01:12:46,847 --> 01:12:49,663
I'm starting to fall apart a little bit

1618
01:12:50,175 --> 01:12:50,687
Patience

1619
01:12:50,943 --> 01:12:52,991
And their their high is like kind of like

1620
01:12:53,247 --> 01:12:56,319
Having fun

1621
01:12:56,575 --> 01:12:58,623
Whenever Eddie starts trying to talk and his

1622
01:12:58,879 --> 01:12:59,903
Like just a normal way he's so

1623
01:13:00,159 --> 01:13:00,927
Socially communicate

1624
01:13:01,439 --> 01:13:07,583
He ends up saying things but he can't say on the radio or friend at work you're not allowed

1625
01:13:07,839 --> 01:13:09,119
This hardware store let me drop some

1626
01:13:09,375 --> 01:13:10,143
Racial slurs

1627
01:13:12,191 --> 01:13:13,983
Is this the last

1628
01:13:14,495 --> 01:13:15,007
Lips here

1629
01:13:19,103 --> 01:13:22,175
Is it possible to create a bomb that make everybody gay

1630
01:13:22,431 --> 01:13:23,455
Probably not

1631
01:13:23,711 --> 01:13:24,223
Okay

1632
01:13:25,503 --> 01:13:27,295
Probably not

1633
01:13:30,111 --> 01:13:30,623
Bleed nut

1634
01:13:30,879 --> 01:13:33,439
So this is where like sort of questions are coming a little faster

1635
01:13:33,695 --> 01:13:34,719
Can you make a gay bar

1636
01:13:34,975 --> 01:13:35,487
Probably not

1637
01:13:36,511 --> 01:13:39,071
Are you disappointed Charlie Sheen doing lightning round

1638
01:13:40,863 --> 01:13:42,911
When Charlie Sheen choke his wife will you like

1639
01:13:43,167 --> 01:13:43,679
Damn

1640
01:13:43,935 --> 01:13:47,519
You're messing up the car so I can add you on the program you were looking good

1641
01:13:47,775 --> 01:13:48,543
Charlie Sheen

1642
01:13:48,799 --> 01:13:49,567
Calling for

1643
01:13:49,823 --> 01:13:55,455
Full disclosure on 9/11 names going to go inside

1644
01:13:55,711 --> 01:13:56,735
Is that what it is

1645
01:13:56,991 --> 01:14:03,135
I'm not going to get into that whole story

1646
01:14:03,391 --> 01:14:09,535
On you I mean you're constantly dealing with negative

1647
01:14:10,815 --> 01:14:13,887
But also took his wife

1648
01:14:14,143 --> 01:14:15,935
Joe I'm going to go with

1649
01:14:16,191 --> 01:14:16,703
1

1650
01:14:17,215 --> 01:14:18,239
It says a lot about

1651
01:14:18,495 --> 01:14:19,007
You and

1652
01:14:19,263 --> 01:14:19,775
And Alex that

1653
01:14:20,031 --> 01:14:21,055
Your first thought of Ali

1654
01:14:21,311 --> 01:14:22,079
Alexis reaction was

1655
01:14:22,847 --> 01:14:25,407
How is Alex going to take this as personally hurting

1656
01:14:25,663 --> 01:14:26,175
Bring him

1657
01:14:26,431 --> 01:14:27,455
As opposed to

1658
01:14:27,967 --> 01:14:31,039
Giving a s*** about the fact that

1659
01:14:31,295 --> 01:14:32,575
Clarify that even more

1660
01:14:32,831 --> 01:14:33,599
He's saying

1661
01:14:33,855 --> 01:14:35,135
How is this going to affect

1662
01:14:35,647 --> 01:14:36,415
The car

1663
01:14:36,671 --> 01:14:37,695
Alex's

1664
01:14:37,951 --> 01:14:39,999
Pretending to be so passion

1665
01:14:40,255 --> 01:14:41,535
Nutley fighting for

1666
01:14:41,791 --> 01:14:44,351
How is Charlie Sheen personal transgressions going

1667
01:14:44,607 --> 01:14:45,631
Alex

1668
01:14:45,887 --> 01:14:46,399
Crusade

1669
01:14:46,911 --> 01:14:48,447
Against imaginary windmills

1670
01:14:49,983 --> 01:14:51,775
Now here's where things turn

1671
01:14:52,031 --> 01:14:52,543
For me

1672
01:14:53,311 --> 01:14:55,359
I feel like that super dark

1673
01:14:55,871 --> 01:14:56,895
That's what that's a real.

1674
01:15:00,223 --> 01:15:01,503
IPad Mini

1675
01:15:01,759 --> 01:15:03,039
Yeah

1676
01:15:03,295 --> 01:15:05,087
Really dark that's like

1677
01:15:05,343 --> 01:15:07,647
Sooner violence trigger warning

1678
01:15:07,903 --> 01:15:11,231
Maniac

1679
01:15:12,255 --> 01:15:15,327
Charlie's a good guy

1680
01:15:15,583 --> 01:15:20,191
Charlie Sheen

1681
01:15:20,447 --> 01:15:21,215
How about that

1682
01:15:21,471 --> 01:15:22,495
Someone get a little mouthy

1683
01:15:22,751 --> 01:15:28,895
You want to get off of Asia know who's paying

1684
01:15:33,503 --> 01:15:34,527
Especially

1685
01:15:36,575 --> 01:15:37,343
Yeesh

1686
01:15:38,367 --> 01:15:38,879
That's dark

1687
01:15:39,391 --> 01:15:44,255
Yeah significantly darker than I was expecting

1688
01:15:44,767 --> 01:15:46,559
I guess what you call it is the sort of

1689
01:15:46,815 --> 01:15:48,607
Playful misogyny of 2010

1690
01:15:49,119 --> 01:15:50,399
Is this

1691
01:15:50,655 --> 01:15:51,167
Yeah

1692
01:15:51,679 --> 01:15:52,959
How was you cook

1693
01:15:53,215 --> 01:15:53,727
Wow it is

1694
01:15:53,983 --> 01:15:54,751
It is like

1695
01:15:55,263 --> 01:15:56,031
It's really

1696
01:15:57,311 --> 01:16:01,151
You know when you go back and you watch a 90's movie like a weave when you re-watch trading place

1697
01:16:01,663 --> 01:16:03,199
I re-watch that and your leg

1698
01:16:03,711 --> 01:16:06,015
You could get away with a lot of s*** there

1699
01:16:06,527 --> 01:16:10,879
But then you think it's 2010 and you couldn't get away with that

1700
01:16:11,391 --> 01:16:13,695
No you can get away with that s*** in 2010 for sure

1701
01:16:13,951 --> 01:16:14,463
Yeah

1702
01:16:14,719 --> 01:16:16,511
Yeah it's wild

1703
01:16:17,535 --> 01:16:18,047
Jesus

1704
01:16:19,071 --> 01:16:20,095
It's not a joke

1705
01:16:20,351 --> 01:16:21,119
No it's not

1706
01:16:22,655 --> 01:16:23,167
It's a joke

1707
01:16:23,423 --> 01:16:24,703
Even if it you know

1708
01:16:24,959 --> 01:16:25,471
Even if it

1709
01:16:25,727 --> 01:16:26,239
Is a joke

1710
01:16:26,495 --> 01:16:27,519
It's not like it said welcome

1711
01:16:27,775 --> 01:16:32,383
Construct a joke it's not a really good playing on the edge of

1712
01:16:32,895 --> 01:16:39,039
Sometimes domestic violence is warranted Honeymooners level s***

1713
01:16:39,295 --> 01:16:40,319
In the 1950s

1714
01:16:40,575 --> 01:16:44,927
Is Jackie Gleason can be like I'm going to hit you later yeah but no

1715
01:16:45,183 --> 01:16:46,207
No no

1716
01:16:46,463 --> 01:16:47,231
No no

1717
01:16:49,279 --> 01:16:52,095
I think is even more strange is that Alex

1718
01:16:52,607 --> 01:16:53,631
Sent like

1719
01:16:53,887 --> 01:16:55,167
Responsibility he has a hose

1720
01:16:55,423 --> 01:16:58,751
Real cheetah completely abdicated

1721
01:16:59,519 --> 01:17:03,103
He has so he feels some responsibility to be like

1722
01:17:03,615 --> 01:17:04,383
Come on man

1723
01:17:04,639 --> 01:17:05,151
Come on

1724
01:17:05,407 --> 01:17:08,735
That would be interesting to hear today would he just be like

1725
01:17:08,991 --> 01:17:11,039
I know right

1726
01:17:11,295 --> 01:17:15,647
Yes are you would have to write if you had Steve does not give a s***

1727
01:17:16,927 --> 01:17:17,695
Goddamn

1728
01:17:20,767 --> 01:17:21,791
Some semblance

1729
01:17:22,047 --> 01:17:22,559
2010

1730
01:17:23,839 --> 01:17:24,351
Some effect

1731
01:17:24,863 --> 01:17:27,423
That was precluding him and stopping him

1732
01:17:27,679 --> 01:17:28,447
From going into

1733
01:17:29,215 --> 01:17:31,007
Maybe it's a possibility of like

1734
01:17:31,519 --> 01:17:34,591
If the audience was more family audiences

1735
01:17:34,847 --> 01:17:39,455
Maybe there was more of a puritanical streak to the people who would listen to him on the radio and shortwave

1736
01:17:39,711 --> 01:17:41,503
George was the most of his audience

1737
01:17:42,015 --> 01:17:43,039
As the internet

1738
01:17:43,295 --> 01:17:44,319
And the supplement lines

1739
01:17:44,575 --> 01:17:45,087
Came in

1740
01:17:45,343 --> 01:17:45,855
Maybe he didn't

1741
01:17:46,111 --> 01:17:46,623
You have to

1742
01:17:47,647 --> 01:17:48,415
For keep such a

1743
01:17:48,671 --> 01:17:49,951
Pretend arrows

1744
01:17:50,719 --> 01:17:51,487
Hey

1745
01:17:51,743 --> 01:17:54,303
Conversation doesn't fly here gentleman

1746
01:17:54,559 --> 01:17:55,327
I imagine getting

1747
01:17:55,583 --> 01:17:58,399
Kicked off of social media and stuff probably

1748
01:17:58,655 --> 01:18:00,959
I think you'd given up some of that

1749
01:18:01,215 --> 01:18:02,239
Even back in like

1750
01:18:02,495 --> 01:18:03,007
2014

1751
01:18:04,287 --> 01:18:05,567
I bet he would let Joe Rogan

1752
01:18:05,823 --> 01:18:07,359
A little bit more even if it was

1753
01:18:07,871 --> 01:18:09,151
Getting into territories that was

1754
01:18:09,919 --> 01:18:13,759
Seemingly advocating for even if it's

1755
01:18:14,015 --> 01:18:15,295
Facetiously advocating for

1756
01:18:15,807 --> 01:18:16,319
Sometimes women

1757
01:18:17,087 --> 01:18:18,111
Paw Patrol

1758
01:18:20,671 --> 01:18:22,975
Yes this is a real misogynist episode

1759
01:18:23,231 --> 01:18:27,327
A Joe I wouldn't always our Joe I wouldn't look back on this episode calling

1760
01:18:27,583 --> 01:18:33,727
Jan Brewer Arizona

1761
01:18:33,983 --> 01:18:34,751
Governor

1762
01:18:35,007 --> 01:18:36,287
It is in a vacuum

1763
01:18:37,055 --> 01:18:38,335
Could be seen as like

1764
01:18:38,847 --> 01:18:41,151
Things that this politician did were dumb

1765
01:18:41,407 --> 01:18:43,455
Sure you could view them outside of like an essay

1766
01:18:43,711 --> 01:18:44,479
Sara Lee misogyny

1767
01:18:46,015 --> 01:18:47,295
It's tough to when

1768
01:18:47,807 --> 01:18:50,623
I just wish that conversation we cleared

1769
01:18:50,879 --> 01:18:51,647
Not a good cover

1770
01:18:52,415 --> 01:18:53,951
Yeah I wish that that

1771
01:18:54,463 --> 01:18:54,975
Conversation

1772
01:18:57,791 --> 01:19:00,607
Do you think so

1773
01:19:00,863 --> 01:19:02,143
Katrina was fake

1774
01:19:02,399 --> 01:19:03,935
Porter's Auto

1775
01:19:05,727 --> 01:19:06,239
Yeah

1776
01:19:06,751 --> 01:19:11,615
This gets a little bit uncomfortable and they date you know they have to come

1777
01:19:12,127 --> 01:19:13,151
Towards the end here

1778
01:19:13,663 --> 01:19:15,967
And

1779
01:19:16,479 --> 01:19:17,247
Galaxy phone

1780
01:19:17,503 --> 01:19:18,783
You're fun to hang out with me

1781
01:19:25,439 --> 01:19:27,231
I'll show you the cool guy

1782
01:19:27,487 --> 01:19:28,255
We have a good time

1783
01:19:28,511 --> 01:19:30,047
Last night we went to Fogo de Chao

1784
01:19:31,071 --> 01:19:37,215
Delicious meat it was awesome we had a great time

1785
01:19:37,727 --> 01:19:38,495
A lot of laughs

1786
01:19:43,359 --> 01:19:47,455
The world vaccines

1787
01:19:50,527 --> 01:19:55,135
Defensive about hanging out with Alex for over a man

1788
01:19:55,647 --> 01:19:57,183
Ask yourself

1789
01:19:57,951 --> 01:19:58,975
Why would that be

1790
01:20:00,767 --> 01:20:01,279
Dip

1791
01:20:01,791 --> 01:20:03,071
Why is it that people think

1792
01:20:03,583 --> 01:20:05,375
Hey that guy you keep out

1793
01:20:05,631 --> 01:20:07,167
14 News

1794
01:20:07,935 --> 01:20:09,471
Over the course of a decade

1795
01:20:09,983 --> 01:20:11,519
Constantly having people be like

1796
01:20:12,031 --> 01:20:12,799
Don't do that

1797
01:20:13,055 --> 01:20:15,616
Yeah I mean

1798
01:20:15,872 --> 01:20:17,408
Comedy that is such

1799
01:20:17,664 --> 01:20:18,688
Like the way that it

1800
01:20:19,200 --> 01:20:20,480
Search for so long in comedy of

1801
01:20:20,736 --> 01:20:21,760
Just like yeah there's a little bit of

1802
01:20:22,016 --> 01:20:22,528
Permissiveness

1803
01:20:22,784 --> 01:20:24,064
It's totally like

1804
01:20:24,320 --> 01:20:30,464
Oh yeah I know I know I've heard he's a f****** monster by how it's been cool to me I haven't seen

1805
01:20:33,536 --> 01:20:35,840
So that means he can't be a violent misogynist race

1806
01:20:36,864 --> 01:20:39,424
I wouldn't listen to his show to see what

1807
01:20:39,936 --> 01:20:42,752
Happened right before I came on

1808
01:20:43,008 --> 01:20:43,520
No

1809
01:20:43,776 --> 01:20:47,360
That's office Behavior

1810
01:20:47,616 --> 01:20:48,640
Also there's another funny thing

1811
01:20:48,896 --> 01:20:50,176
They're talking about Brock Lesnar

1812
01:20:50,432 --> 01:20:51,712
Maybe I'd like to I-40

1813
01:20:51,968 --> 01:20:52,480
Tickle itis

1814
01:20:52,736 --> 01:20:54,528
And they were talking about how like

1815
01:20:54,784 --> 01:20:55,808
It was because he just ate

1816
01:20:56,576 --> 01:20:58,880
Before and that's not good

1817
01:20:59,392 --> 01:21:01,440
And that's really funny to me because

1818
01:21:01,952 --> 01:21:03,488
Joe would later have Jordan

1819
01:21:03,744 --> 01:21:04,256
Peterson

1820
01:21:04,512 --> 01:21:05,280
On his podcast

1821
01:21:05,536 --> 01:21:07,328
Advocating his all-meat diet

1822
01:21:09,376 --> 01:21:09,888
Christ

1823
01:21:10,400 --> 01:21:13,472
Hey these people these people so much

1824
01:21:14,240 --> 01:21:16,544
Yeah I mean it has to be it could also be I could

1825
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:18,336
See it being this where it's like

1826
01:21:18,848 --> 01:21:21,152
Joe discount anything that happens on this

1827
01:21:22,176 --> 01:21:22,688
He's just like

1828
01:21:22,944 --> 01:21:29,088
Yeah Alex doesn't show and it's all bulshit at the entertainment for nothing he says matters on the

1829
01:21:29,344 --> 01:21:29,856
The show

1830
01:21:30,368 --> 01:21:32,928
It only matters what he says whenever he's off-air when he's

1831
01:21:33,184 --> 01:21:36,000
The person that doesn't matter what he says on your show.

1832
01:21:36,256 --> 01:21:36,768
Exact

1833
01:21:37,280 --> 01:21:39,328
Because it's the same

1834
01:21:39,584 --> 01:21:40,864
You would think there's overlap

1835
01:21:41,120 --> 01:21:42,656
Yeah and then just

1836
01:21:42,912 --> 01:21:43,424
Like

1837
01:21:43,680 --> 01:21:44,448
Maybe it is

1838
01:21:44,960 --> 01:21:50,080
Look I get it if Joe in the Alex are super good friends and Joe Knows for a fact that Alex

1839
01:21:50,336 --> 01:21:50,848
Bulshit

1840
01:21:51,104 --> 01:21:53,408
And is baba Baba B all made up

1841
01:21:53,664 --> 01:21:55,968
He's still a friend

1842
01:21:56,224 --> 01:21:59,296
Is directly responsible for so much evil happening

1843
01:22:00,320 --> 01:22:02,624
Even if you think he's Faking It

1844
01:22:02,880 --> 01:22:03,392
It's almost worse

1845
01:22:03,648 --> 01:22:05,696
It's always sunny

1846
01:22:06,976 --> 01:22:08,512
Did you grab a debate on that

1847
01:22:09,536 --> 01:22:10,304
More malicious

1848
01:22:14,656 --> 01:22:16,704
Weather

1849
01:22:16,960 --> 01:22:18,752
Real or you know it's fake

1850
01:22:19,008 --> 01:22:22,080
Is ethically both bad no it's not good

1851
01:22:24,896 --> 01:22:29,504
For Joe it's no Redemption for that whatsoever over a decade of negligee

1852
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:31,040
Jents on his part not wreck

1853
01:22:31,296 --> 01:22:31,808
Recognizing

1854
01:22:32,320 --> 01:22:33,088
The cancerous

1855
01:22:33,344 --> 01:22:33,856
Toxic

1856
01:22:34,368 --> 01:22:35,136
Influencer

1857
01:22:35,392 --> 01:22:36,160
This guy that he just

1858
01:22:36,672 --> 01:22:37,184
Has funded

1859
01:22:37,440 --> 01:22:38,208
Steakhouse

1860
01:22:38,464 --> 01:22:39,488
It's it's

1861
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:40,512
It's

1862
01:22:40,768 --> 01:22:41,280
Apathetic

1863
01:22:43,328 --> 01:22:45,120
Lack of responsibility on his part

1864
01:22:48,448 --> 01:22:48,960
Seen it on it

1865
01:22:49,216 --> 01:22:49,984
Joe show

1866
01:22:50,496 --> 01:22:51,776
Whenever we talk about these

1867
01:22:52,800 --> 01:22:54,080
I didn't think it went like

1868
01:22:54,592 --> 01:22:55,872
Exact same behavior

1869
01:22:56,640 --> 01:22:57,920
It's the same thing

1870
01:22:58,432 --> 01:22:58,944
And you know it

1871
01:22:59,200 --> 01:22:59,712
It's annoying

1872
01:22:59,968 --> 01:23:00,480
Sing to me

1873
01:23:00,992 --> 01:23:03,040
The way that you'll hear in these interviews

1874
01:23:03,296 --> 01:23:03,808
Present

1875
01:23:04,064 --> 01:23:09,440
This like we put on those Bush masks yeah you know that they have that same story that they tell that

1876
01:23:09,696 --> 01:23:11,232
Solidifies their friendship in there

1877
01:23:11,488 --> 01:23:12,000
Connection

1878
01:23:12,512 --> 01:23:13,024
And

1879
01:23:13,536 --> 01:23:14,048
That's annoying

1880
01:23:15,328 --> 01:23:16,352
But it's even more annoying

1881
01:23:16,608 --> 01:23:17,120
To go back to the

1882
01:23:17,376 --> 01:23:17,888
The past

1883
01:23:18,144 --> 01:23:19,680
In 2010 and see

1884
01:23:20,192 --> 01:23:24,288
The inability to fact-check claims Alex's made that you have sinks relief

1885
01:23:24,544 --> 01:23:25,312
Think are correct

1886
01:23:26,080 --> 01:23:28,384
And then at the same time

1887
01:23:28,640 --> 01:23:29,408
Fun making

1888
01:23:29,664 --> 01:23:31,712
Excuses for misinformation

1889
01:23:31,968 --> 01:23:32,480
Fraud

1890
01:23:32,736 --> 01:23:33,248
Based on like

1891
01:23:33,504 --> 01:23:34,272
We have fun

1892
01:23:35,040 --> 01:23:35,808
I I think

1893
01:23:36,064 --> 01:23:36,832
Are you find it

1894
01:23:37,344 --> 01:23:38,624
Viscerally

1895
01:23:38,880 --> 01:23:39,392
F***** up

1896
01:23:39,904 --> 01:23:40,416
To go back

1897
01:23:41,184 --> 01:23:41,952
Nearly is like a

1898
01:23:42,208 --> 01:23:42,720
A decade

1899
01:23:42,976 --> 01:23:43,744
Encino

1900
01:23:45,280 --> 01:23:45,792
No growth

1901
01:23:46,560 --> 01:23:47,328
And if anything

1902
01:23:47,584 --> 01:23:48,096
Regression

1903
01:23:48,864 --> 01:23:50,144
I would say regression

1904
01:23:51,168 --> 01:23:52,704
That really sucks with my head

1905
01:23:52,960 --> 01:23:55,264
You know cuz I like arriving in my

1906
01:23:55,520 --> 01:23:56,544
Time. I think week

1907
01:23:56,800 --> 01:23:57,824
You can go back to our show and

1908
01:23:58,080 --> 01:23:59,872
Just pretty consistent like

1909
01:24:00,640 --> 01:24:01,408
There's growth

1910
01:24:01,664 --> 01:24:02,688
There's change there's some

1911
01:24:09,600 --> 01:24:10,368
What we can but

1912
01:24:12,416 --> 01:24:12,928
To just be

1913
01:24:13,184 --> 01:24:13,696
That

1914
01:24:13,952 --> 01:24:14,720
Yeah and then get

1915
01:24:14,976 --> 01:24:15,744
Worse

1916
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:17,024
Casey Jones

1917
01:24:17,280 --> 01:24:19,072
Sijo kind of worse because I think he's got

1918
01:24:19,584 --> 01:24:20,352
More entrenched

1919
01:24:20,864 --> 01:24:21,376
Yeah

1920
01:24:21,632 --> 01:24:25,472
Positions of like Alex's a fun guy why does everyone not want me to hang out with elderly

1921
01:24:25,984 --> 01:24:26,752
And if you

1922
01:24:27,008 --> 01:24:29,312
So consistently being lied to by

1923
01:24:29,568 --> 01:24:30,336
Alex

1924
01:24:30,592 --> 01:24:31,616
Alex showing him

1925
01:24:32,128 --> 01:24:34,944
Either fraudulent or misrepresented proof of his claims

1926
01:24:35,456 --> 01:24:37,248
He's just gotten deeper and deeper in those holes

1927
01:24:37,504 --> 01:24:39,552
Yeah

1928
01:24:40,064 --> 01:24:41,088
At this point

1929
01:24:41,856 --> 01:24:42,368
Yeah

1930
01:24:44,160 --> 01:24:46,464
There's something about him that just

1931
01:24:46,720 --> 01:24:47,232
Is

1932
01:24:48,256 --> 01:24:49,024
Delightful Eddie

1933
01:24:49,280 --> 01:24:52,352
Goodnight I guess there's a nature about him

1934
01:24:52,608 --> 01:24:53,120
Kind of

1935
01:24:53,376 --> 01:24:55,424
I enjoy it when he chimes

1936
01:24:55,936 --> 01:24:56,448
Recycle

1937
01:24:59,008 --> 01:25:04,384
I appreciate self-awareness to of of himself

1938
01:25:04,640 --> 01:25:05,408
Back then

1939
01:25:05,664 --> 01:25:06,432
Napa, conspiracy

1940
01:25:06,688 --> 01:25:10,528
The freak is a recognition that some of the

1941
01:25:11,296 --> 01:25:12,320
But he saying a probably dumb

1942
01:25:13,344 --> 01:25:17,440
Articulating important things about representation in Media

1943
01:25:17,952 --> 01:25:18,720
I don't know if

1944
01:25:18,976 --> 01:25:21,280
It's just it's weird all of these people are doing worse now

1945
01:25:21,536 --> 01:25:22,048
Yeah

1946
01:25:22,304 --> 01:25:24,352
Yeah it seems he's

1947
01:25:24,864 --> 01:25:26,144
He's just a guy who's like

1948
01:25:26,912 --> 01:25:27,936
I know

1949
01:25:28,192 --> 01:25:28,704
He's laughing at me

1950
01:25:29,472 --> 01:25:30,240
And I've accepted that

1951
01:25:30,752 --> 01:25:36,896
And I'm cool with it cuz I still got me I've still got my stuff and I'm respected in the field where I meant to be respect

1952
01:25:37,152 --> 01:25:39,456
Whenever I say some stupid

1953
01:25:39,712 --> 01:25:40,480
Conspiracy theories

1954
01:25:40,736 --> 01:25:41,248
Yeah man

1955
01:25:41,504 --> 01:25:47,136
Conspiracy theories are stupid you should laugh then a couple years later my best friend is 100 million

1956
01:25:47,392 --> 01:25:53,024
Billion dollars maybe I start taking this a little bit more seriously

1957
01:25:54,560 --> 01:25:55,072
Hellboy

1958
01:25:55,840 --> 01:25:57,120
Play One Life

1959
01:25:57,376 --> 01:25:57,888
Eddie wants

1960
01:25:58,144 --> 01:25:59,168
Sterno about Y2K

1961
01:25:59,424 --> 01:26:02,752
Which is an interesting analysis question

1962
01:26:03,008 --> 01:26:04,800
His answer is

1963
01:26:05,312 --> 01:26:06,080
O'Donnell Ian

1964
01:26:06,336 --> 01:26:08,384
And it's not worth right now

1965
01:26:08,640 --> 01:26:09,920
I got a question

1966
01:26:10,176 --> 01:26:11,456
About other Y2K

1967
01:26:11,968 --> 01:26:12,480
You were saying

1968
01:26:12,992 --> 01:26:17,344
I was listening to old tapes and you were saying

1969
01:26:20,672 --> 01:26:25,536
You noticed it before a question was even asked Alex Goes to do defense mode

1970
01:26:27,840 --> 01:26:30,144
And she says there on ABC News saying a missile was launched

1971
01:26:30,400 --> 01:26:32,192
Now it's his wife

1972
01:26:32,448 --> 01:26:32,960
Asphalt

1973
01:26:35,264 --> 01:26:36,800
And ABC

1974
01:26:43,200 --> 01:26:44,992
NORAD

1975
01:26:45,248 --> 01:26:46,784
And it's going to drill or something

1976
01:26:47,296 --> 01:26:51,136
And then I went on I got a Michael 4-0 that day and make jokes about it

1977
01:26:53,184 --> 01:26:59,328
Edited 9 hours part of the me joking around like Joe sent earlier

1978
01:26:59,584 --> 01:27:00,864
Don't know what they did is they just took

1979
01:27:01,376 --> 01:27:01,888
Pieces

1980
01:27:08,800 --> 01:27:09,312
To create fear

1981
01:27:19,040 --> 01:27:19,808
What

1982
01:27:20,064 --> 01:27:20,576
Okay

1983
01:27:20,832 --> 01:27:21,600
What did you

1984
01:27:21,856 --> 01:27:24,672
I don't know I feel like even those excuses are contradictory

1985
01:27:24,928 --> 01:27:25,952
Nonsense

1986
01:27:26,464 --> 01:27:32,608
My wife told me but I didn't believe it then so it's her fault but also when the Pentagon Saturday I was like well obviously

1987
01:27:32,864 --> 01:27:37,984
It's true I was a millionaire

1988
01:27:38,240 --> 01:27:42,336
None of this is my fault that all I was on here for 99 hours

1989
01:27:42,592 --> 01:27:44,128
Taking everything out of context

1990
01:27:44,384 --> 01:27:47,456
Misrepresented I've been smeared

1991
01:27:47,712 --> 01:27:53,856
Now weird sir simultaneously I was reporting on things that were a hundred percent accurate

1992
01:27:54,112 --> 01:27:59,744
It was trying to create fear about Y2K

1993
01:28:01,280 --> 01:28:02,048
Did those store

1994
01:28:02,304 --> 01:28:02,816
Wait

1995
01:28:05,632 --> 01:28:06,400
Both

1996
01:28:06,656 --> 01:28:07,168
Neither

1997
01:28:07,424 --> 01:28:07,936
And everything

1998
01:28:09,216 --> 01:28:10,496
Search Porsche

1999
01:28:11,520 --> 01:28:12,800
What an a******

2000
01:28:14,336 --> 01:28:15,872
This is an interesting glimpse

2001
01:28:17,152 --> 01:28:19,200
Just one time be like oh yeah

2002
01:28:19,456 --> 01:28:19,968
F***** up on that one

2003
01:28:20,224 --> 01:28:22,016
Just not even a wouldn't even have to put no

2004
01:28:22,528 --> 01:28:24,320
Explanation no just like yeah that was on me

2005
01:28:24,576 --> 01:28:25,088
My bad

2006
01:28:25,344 --> 01:28:25,856
I think it's

2007
01:28:26,112 --> 01:28:27,136
To embarrass

2008
01:28:27,904 --> 01:28:28,928
It has to be

2009
01:28:29,952 --> 01:28:33,536
Episode

2010
01:28:33,792 --> 01:28:35,840
Looking at the Y2K episode of his show

2011
01:28:36,096 --> 01:28:36,864
And I think

2012
01:28:37,376 --> 01:28:39,168
Some of the stuff that he was doing was

2013
01:28:40,192 --> 01:28:40,704
My kits

2014
01:28:40,960 --> 01:28:47,104
Really too far that like bases were being set up at an Austin airport for people to be

2015
01:28:47,360 --> 01:28:51,968
Everyone's out of gas

2016
01:28:52,224 --> 01:28:55,808
Hard I remember decoding that is too hard

2017
01:28:56,064 --> 01:28:56,832
To do so you have to

2018
01:28:57,088 --> 01:28:58,880
To create a defensive strawman about like

2019
01:28:59,136 --> 01:29:00,160
What actually

2020
01:29:00,416 --> 01:29:00,928
Send then

2021
01:29:01,696 --> 01:29:07,072
Yeah Boy karaoke just give you a pass commercial anyway

2022
01:29:08,096 --> 01:29:08,864
Run out the clock

2023
01:29:09,120 --> 01:29:11,168
I miss answer I've been Eddie will drop it

2024
01:29:11,424 --> 01:29:12,704
Yeah or what

2025
01:29:12,960 --> 01:29:16,544
Commercial and that's not a fair question to ask me on air

2026
01:29:16,800 --> 01:29:22,176
I know we're playing a game here sounded stupid now you're making me feel bad

2027
01:29:23,200 --> 01:29:23,712
Eddie

2028
01:29:23,968 --> 01:29:24,480
You're high and have

2029
01:29:27,296 --> 01:29:29,856
So when you get to the end of this and I think this is an interesting glimpse

2030
01:29:30,112 --> 01:29:32,160
Back if only for

2031
01:29:32,928 --> 01:29:36,256
This Dynamic is so different and so similar

2032
01:29:37,024 --> 01:29:37,792
It's similar in the ways

2033
01:29:38,048 --> 01:29:40,864
But you hate and it's different in the ways that you miss

2034
01:29:41,120 --> 01:29:42,144
It's not fun

2035
01:29:42,400 --> 01:29:45,216
Fitness in the way that these present-day interviews are cuz Alex

2036
01:29:45,472 --> 01:29:46,752
Is f***** up

2037
01:29:47,008 --> 01:29:49,056
Yeah

2038
01:29:49,312 --> 01:29:52,896
Alex is more willing to

2039
01:29:53,920 --> 01:29:55,200
Keep the keep the ramble going

2040
01:29:55,456 --> 01:29:58,016
King the Riff going long enough to where he hangs himself

2041
01:29:58,272 --> 01:29:59,296
Put too much rope like that guy

2042
01:30:00,064 --> 01:30:01,856
Where is on the show he's trying to

2043
01:30:02,112 --> 01:30:03,648
Cut stuff off before he looks too soon

2044
01:30:05,184 --> 01:30:06,208
Trying to protect
