00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:20,992
Air Jordan X swetik

2
00:00:21,248 --> 00:00:27,392
I have great respect for knowledge babe I'm sick of them posing as if through the good guy

3
00:00:53,504 --> 00:00:56,832
Stripe.com

4
00:01:06,304 --> 00:01:06,816
Alex

5
00:01:07,328 --> 00:01:08,096
Joe

6
00:01:08,608 --> 00:01:12,192
Indeed Emerick if you're nasty Ono I'm not

7
00:01:12,448 --> 00:01:12,960
I'm actually

8
00:01:13,216 --> 00:01:16,032
Quite polite

9
00:01:16,288 --> 00:01:17,056
Jordan

10
00:01:17,312 --> 00:01:18,336
What's up

11
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:20,640
That you go

12
00:01:21,152 --> 00:01:27,296
Okay my bright spot today Dan is I saw this new TV show anime called

13
00:01:27,552 --> 00:01:28,064
Sonny Boy

14
00:01:28,576 --> 00:01:30,624
It is

15
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:31,904
F****** spectacular

16
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:35,744
It's so good it's an examination of this

17
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:38,048
Japanese High School class tickets

18
00:01:38,304 --> 00:01:43,936
Unmoored in space and type right and so allowing that to happen you get a

19
00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:45,472
Wonderful mix of like

20
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:51,104
Lord of the Flies examination of the dawn of civilization and societies growth in

21
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,152
How should falls apart along with

22
00:01:53,408 --> 00:01:59,552
Emotional messaging. It's so good it just so good it's a great great show

23
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:01,088
Highly recommended

24
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,368
Cool

25
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:06,464
What's your birthday

26
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:11,584
What right spot is their rudeness.

27
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,888
Actually this is

28
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:20,288
This is tough for me I actually don't know what my bright spot is when know what it is but I don't know what the name of it is

29
00:02:20,544 --> 00:02:23,616
I saw a energy drink

30
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:24,640
That was at the store

31
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:26,432
And I got it

32
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:28,224
Because it looked like an interesting flavor

33
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:29,248
Sure

34
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:30,016
It was great

35
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:33,088
It was a Hawaiian shaved ice flavor

36
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:39,232
Interesting energy drink with a Hawaiian shaved ice flavored white rice interesting

37
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:42,816
Just basically like a strawberry watermelon

38
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:47,168
Tasty

39
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:53,568
Whatever I don't know if I didn't think I was just advertised so f*** that

40
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:56,640
Energy drink

41
00:02:56,896 --> 00:02:59,200
Some brand I like it right spot

42
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:05,344
Absolutely Jordan today we are in the past about July

43
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,392
10th 2003

44
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:09,440
We noticed there's a little bit of a gap

45
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:14,048
Between our last episode and July Temps

46
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:15,072
So here's what

47
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:22,240
The audio is unlistenable I tried to fiddle with it and get it to a point where it could

48
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:23,776
Actually be usable but it's just

49
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:26,080
9th and 8th are

50
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:27,616
Like its

51
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:28,384
Outrageous

52
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,664
It's comically bad

53
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:33,504
This audio but I do listen to a bit of the 8th

54
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:36,064
And Paul Joseph Watson showed up

55
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:38,112
He just written his book

56
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:40,928
Wow that is a while back

57
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:44,512
They're promoting Paul Joseph Watson book

58
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:45,280
Yeah

59
00:03:45,536 --> 00:03:48,352
70

60
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:49,888
Yeah but he's around

61
00:03:50,144 --> 00:03:54,496
And that's a lot of fun but audio

62
00:03:55,264 --> 00:03:56,032
I'm very excited about this up

63
00:03:56,288 --> 00:03:57,312
Episode

64
00:03:58,848 --> 00:03:59,360
Waiting

65
00:03:59,616 --> 00:04:04,224
Anxiously to be able to talk about this it's so much fun

66
00:04:05,248 --> 00:04:06,272
Say hello to

67
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:11,392

68
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:18,047

77
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:56,703
July 10th

78
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:57,983
Delight 2003

79
00:04:58,239 --> 00:05:00,543
710 03

80
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:01,311
Not

81
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:04,127
Be more thrilled that this audio was

82
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:06,175
Listenable

83
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:07,199
This wasn't

84
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:08,991
I would feel

85
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:10,527
Just so

86
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:12,063
Deprived

87
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:13,343
Here's how we start

88
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:18,207
Neocon

89
00:05:18,975 --> 00:05:19,743
Coming on the broad

90
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:27,167
Movement

91
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:33,567
Telling you

92
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:42,783
Well the Patriot Act

93
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:51,231
I'm not a liberal

94
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:04,543
Alex has got a big deal Khan, show

95
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:17,087
The National Review been reborn with a clone of what's-his-face

96
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:18,623
Who knows

97
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:23,999
William F Buckley

98
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:25,535
Look

99
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:26,303
We don't know who it is

100
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:27,839
And Alex won't say

101
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:52,159
Horse

102
00:06:55,743 --> 00:07:01,887
Yes Alex is going to have a parade of Trojan horses excited about this idea

103
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:05,471
Leo cons on Lisa's going to he's going to go toe-to-toe with them

104
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:10,591
Very excited

105
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:12,383
When you let it in

106
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:16,223
Was that was the big mistake that was the problem

107
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:20,319
Yeah it wasn't that there was a trojan horse outside

108
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:23,647
That was a great place for the horse to meet you want to leave it out there

109
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:27,231
You defeat the Trojan Horse by leaving it alone

110
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:29,535
You don't want to parade of Trojan horses that's

111
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:34,911
A parade worse than regular

112
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:36,703
Not good

113
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:40,543
I'll bet you love this idea that I can't say the name

114
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:48,223
What kind of assholes here's their name in the first hour not here

115
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:49,759
I might cancel if I heard out

116
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:50,783
Talking like this

117
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:56,159
I have one

118
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:06,655
One of the technicians

119
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:11,775
The

120
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:16,383
New World Order

121
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:18,175
Neocon

122
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:20,991
Border Police

123
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:37,119
Probably cancel

124
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:39,679
Exciting prospect

125
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:46,079
I'm a slimy creature in front of his audience

126
00:08:46,335 --> 00:08:49,407
That's a little bit combative before it's even begun

127
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:51,711
Nah.

128
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:55,039
Continues

129
00:08:57,599 --> 00:08:59,903
Neocom coming out

130
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:03,487
But there

131
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:05,023
Their own lies against them

132
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:06,047
Sure

133
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:13,983
When I come off at this point I'm just thinking like he's trying to get this person to cancer

134
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:22,431
This is like please just cancel I am going to disembowel this person because if I act

135
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:28,831
Actually talk to them I will be disemboweled because I'm full of this is a big fat slimy neocon who I

136
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:35,231
I've only invited on the show is a trap to destroy them in front of my audience

137
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:38,303
Demolish it doesn't scream good faith

138
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:39,071
No

139
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:41,119
No I was listening to this

140
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:44,447
Yes yes yes so excited this is going to be fun

141
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:49,823
Cancel and then Alex is going to be like another cat

142
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:52,127
What I thought was going to happen

143
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:53,151
It does not

144
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:55,711
That is not what happened person shows up

145
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:59,039
And it's a mess in in Syria

146
00:09:59,295 --> 00:10:01,855
But before we get to that cuz that's in the third

147
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:04,671
Yes plenty of other meat to get to like

148
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:08,511
On our last episode going over 2,000

149
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:12,351
Alex had warned that on the 4th of July there might be a little bit of a Terrace

150
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:14,143
Well I mean it's a good day for

151
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:15,423
Until this caller asked

152
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:16,447
About like a man

153
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:18,495
What was going on what happened

154
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:20,799
Yeah I heard you

155
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:22,591
Play something about you're worried about

156
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:25,407
Federal Reserve Bankers Lautner

157
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:26,175
Microfiche

158
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:28,479
Cutting Loose

159
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:30,271
July

160
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:37,439
Nailed it

161
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:38,975
They're only going to do it when I

162
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:39,999
Kids are in school

163
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:53,823
Undisclosed location

164
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:02,527
I know

165
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:03,551
You can't open up

166
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:06,623
The school year now in all if you want to open up the revolution

167
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:11,231
If there is to not go along with the next school year

168
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:14,559
That would open up a whole bunch of questions

169
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:31,711
What would 14 be disgusting

170
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:33,759
Why was there why

171
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:40,159
Wasn't there a terrorist attack I didn't say there was going to be there was going to be one

172
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:48,607
But I didn't I wasn't wrong

173
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:55,007
It's like misinformation is part of the part of it you know it

174
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:56,543
Maybe it was just important

175
00:11:56,799 --> 00:12:02,943
Art of War this information is important for both enemies and allies

176
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:03,967
That's that's

177
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:05,759
That's kind of the

178
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:07,807
I like his rejoinder of like

179
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:14,207
Well obviously there wasn't a terrorist attack they're only going to do it when our kids are in school a dummy

180
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:16,255
That's an interesting premise

181
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:22,911
So they're only going to do a giant kids are in school to stop this from happening

182
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:25,215
Exact

183
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:32,127
It is it is so fictional it's a little bit like to D&D nerds are like no

184
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:33,407
No no no

185
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:34,687
Dragons only attack

186
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:41,087
Near large mountain it's not going to be around

187
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:48,511
Yeah and I like that Alex is responsive that seems to be like yeah yeah

188
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:50,047
So the way to stop

189
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:52,095
These date of the big one coming

190
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:58,495
Is not have the kids in school that's why I'm schooling is so popular

191
00:12:58,751 --> 00:13:02,591
Cuz I need to have those kids in school 41 vagina terrorist attack does happen

192
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:03,871
Alright

193
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:07,967
What kind of a day did the globalist have when they were like oh no

194
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:14,367
We were going to do it when all the kids were in school but we took too long now there's so many of them being homeschooled

195
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:15,391
Are we going to do now

196
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:21,791
It does like Montessori School Waldorf education

197
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:24,607
No question there are italics

198
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:25,375
To clarify

199
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:28,447
My man

200
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:31,007
Damn from Illinois is back

201
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:34,335
He's a good dude calls in every day

202
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:36,895
Call boy

203
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:40,223
Two-bedroom still couldn't

204
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:43,551
It's not about what

205
00:13:56,607 --> 00:13:57,119
Interesting

206
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:00,447
Documents

207
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:05,055
Talking about the rebuilding America's defenses document

208
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:06,847
Document

209
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:10,687
Hot as it's often because the tag is off you think it's a 1998

210
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:17,343
Alex is talking about is not a white paper and more you hear him use that term the more you need to ask yourself if you even know what that

211
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:24,255
This was a 1998 open letter the project for The New American Century sent to then President Clinton

212
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:26,559
Urging him to pursue regime-change in a rock

213
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:28,351
The letter begins quote

214
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:30,399
We're writing you because we are convinced

215
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:33,471
What's the current American policy toward Iraq is not succeeding

216
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:38,591
And that we may soon face a threat in the Middle East more serious then we have known since the end of

217
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:39,359
The Cold War

218
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:45,247
And your upcoming State of the Union Address you have an opportunity to charity clear and determined course for meeting this threat

219
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:49,599
We are due to seize that opportunity and to enunciate a new strategy that would

220
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:52,671
Security interests of the United States and our friends and allies

221
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:53,695
Around the world

222
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:58,559
That strategy should aim above alt at the removal of Saddam Hussein's regime from Power

223
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:00,351
Agree with it or not

224
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:03,423
Absolutely doesn't seem like it's coming from folks

225
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:05,215
We're saying that Saddam doesn't pose a threat

226
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:08,799
No no that one says we got to get rid of

227
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:10,335
Seems like it

228
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:15,967
That was a memo from 1998 that was signed onto by Donald Rumsfeld but not Dick Cheney

229
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:23,391
Heather sionito is a future Trump National Security adviser John Bolton

230
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:25,695
An apparatchik

231
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:30,559
A couple months after that letter was that the group followed up with another letter to Newt Gingrich then

232
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:31,583
Speaker of the House

233
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:34,655
And Trent Lott the then-senate majority leader

234
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:37,471
The weather was basically

235
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:40,287
Clinton to work on getting Saddam out of power but he wasn't biting

236
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:46,431
They reiterated that it was their belief that policy of containment that it been in place regarding sedov weren't working

237
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:49,759
And that if left unchecked he posed a very severe threat

238
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:50,783
Perhaps the worst sense

239
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:51,551
The Cold War

240
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:58,207
These are the letters that were written in 1998 that were seen as being addictive of a longstanding desire on the part of the member

241
00:15:58,463 --> 00:15:59,231
The Bush Administration

242
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:00,767
To topple Saddam governor

243
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:03,583
It's either the case that Alex is just making up

244
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:07,423
Things about these documents or he has such a shaky grasp on what they say

245
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:12,543
But he thinks that they're saying that Saddam isn't a threat and that it's just an opportunity

246
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:13,311
The resource

247
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:14,591
Sprite I don't know

248
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:15,615
No I mean

249
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:19,455
I guess I guess what are you

250
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:20,991
Saying is

251
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:25,087
He's just editorializing that there

252
00:16:25,343 --> 00:16:27,647
They were aware within those letters

253
00:16:28,159 --> 00:16:30,207
That they sent saying we should overthrow

254
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:36,607
Saddam what was unsaid was that the reason we're doing this because we want that f****** that's an interesting

255
00:16:40,703 --> 00:16:41,983
And if Alex

256
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:48,383
Secretly they were signaling that would be the claim would be different difference

257
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:50,175
Then wrote the white papers

258
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:55,039
Saying that they knew that Saddam was just wanted resources to make a base which is not

259
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:56,319
What that letter say

260
00:16:56,575 --> 00:16:59,135
It would be a bad idea to write a letter that says

261
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:01,183
And I'm going to throw this out

262
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:03,999
Because it could be obtained by

263
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:05,023
I will in the future

264
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:09,631
Yeah

265
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:11,167
I wouldn't put that in writing

266
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:14,751
Illinois

267
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:16,799
This caller asked about like

268
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:21,407
You know we talked about tearing a lot but what about the tyranny of the early part of our country

269
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:22,943
How do you feel about that

270
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:24,223
Okay

271
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:26,271
Tyranny

272
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:28,831
Express store

273
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:31,135
Mi flavor

274
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:32,927
I was just interesting thoughts

275
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:34,207
I am not surprised

276
00:17:47,007 --> 00:17:48,031
Four score

277
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:02,367
No one

278
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:05,695
What happened to the America

279
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:06,463
LeBrons

280
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:14,911
I'm a cute view of history but it's so detached from reality I can't really believe that this is an expression of like idealism or no

281
00:18:15,167 --> 00:18:15,679
Naivete

282
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:17,215
Seems like rationalizing

283
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:23,615
Prettiest do it it's fine that they were slaves because if they didn't want to be slaves

284
00:18:25,407 --> 00:18:30,271
The idea that no one can take your rights is so dumb that it barely has a meaning in the real world

285
00:18:30,783 --> 00:18:34,623
If u.s. history teaches us one thing it so you can totally have your rights deprived from you

286
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:37,439
You may still have those rights in an abstract

287
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:39,487
Accents like you deserve those right

288
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:42,047
B but in terms of actual concrete reality

289
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:45,119
If the US says you can't vote you don't have the right to vote

290
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:46,655
No in the United States

291
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:53,055
The angle that seems like a cop-out but that has nothing to do with the absurdity of this position that he's like well maybe

292
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:53,823
Maybe the right

293
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:56,639
The protection of Rights weren't enforced or direct

294
00:18:56,895 --> 00:18:58,431
Native Americans are Black America

295
00:18:59,199 --> 00:19:00,735
What does it mean to not have

296
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:03,039
Protection of Rights directed at you

297
00:19:03,551 --> 00:19:05,343
It feels like it means like you don't have those right

298
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:07,903
I think what he's trying to say is that

299
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:09,695
The founding fathers were like

300
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:10,975
Itching at the bit to

301
00:19:11,231 --> 00:19:12,511
To give everybody right right

302
00:19:13,023 --> 00:19:14,047
But because

303
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:17,631
Black people and Native Americans at that time

304
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:18,911
Didn't ask

305
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:25,311
The founding fathers for those rides didn't say anything they were just

306
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:28,895
Hey I'm loving this genocide over here you guys keep it coming

307
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:33,759
Yeah what do you say that their protection over the enforcement of right

308
00:19:34,015 --> 00:19:40,159
It's worth directed at these people it seems like you just trying really hard to not say that the US had laws on the books

309
00:19:40,415 --> 00:19:41,695
Depriving people of specific rights

310
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:43,487
Based on their race or gender

311
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:49,887
The stupidest part of this club is that Alex's pretending that he thinks that groups like Native Americans are black Americans needed to stand up

312
00:19:50,143 --> 00:19:51,167
Send Amanda god-given right

313
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:58,079
Dumb because the way you saying that you really have to think of you'd be right there on their side supporting campaign for equal

314
00:19:58,335 --> 00:19:59,103
America

315
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:00,895
That's not true

316
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:04,223
He stated his opposition to the Civil Rights Act in the past

317
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:05,247
Because among other thing

318
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:08,319
Things he feels that requiring businesses to serve people of all Races

319
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:11,135
Could be a violation of their right of free association

320
00:20:11,647 --> 00:20:15,487
Further his Heroes and intellectual Traditions his worldview grows out of

321
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:18,559
They fought tooth-and-nail against the Civil Rights Act in the voting

322
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:25,727
His favorite author Gary Allen wrote the book Communist Revolution in the streets Bertrand caused by black Americans for equal

323
00:20:25,983 --> 00:20:29,055
Right as the result of a nefarious communist conspiracy

324
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:33,151
Alex doesn't believe any of the things he's saying just called he just knows that

325
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:35,199
And I believe it otherwise is

326
00:20:35,711 --> 00:20:36,991
Bad luck

327
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:41,343
Yeah you can't really say that and then if somebody was like hey

328
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:47,743
What about that time America made it illegal to be Chinese here you can't be like all that was too far away

329
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:54,143
Chinese-americans just didn't stand up

330
00:20:54,399 --> 00:21:00,543
Everybody David you got to ask for what you need otherwise you're going to let white people just run all over

331
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:01,823
Not be excluded

332
00:21:02,079 --> 00:21:04,639
It was a terrible idea you got to send a letter for

333
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:07,199
True

334
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:11,807
So Alex get another caller in this guy has an interesting idea about how to promote Alec

335
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:13,087
Next to the masses

336
00:21:13,343 --> 00:21:17,696
Make it illegal to be Chinese here no idea would not work well

337
00:21:18,464 --> 00:21:19,232
I really hope

338
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:20,256
Your staff

339
00:21:21,536 --> 00:21:22,048
Get your

340
00:21:23,328 --> 00:21:25,120

New World Order

344
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:57,632
Mineral water

345
00:22:05,056 --> 00:22:08,384
The color is saying hey you should go on The Daily Show

346
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:12,480
Response to that is hey you know what Gary Busey likes me

347
00:22:14,016 --> 00:22:15,296
Okay

348
00:22:15,552 --> 00:22:21,696
He is a show that was on Comedy Central

349
00:22:21,952 --> 00:22:22,720
Tissue their butt

350
00:22:23,232 --> 00:22:24,512
I forgot about I'm with Busey

351
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:29,888
Easy to forget I will only ever I live a Charmed

352
00:22:30,144 --> 00:22:32,448
My Busey began

353
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:33,472
Ended

354
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:34,240
Point Break

355
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:39,616
She and I never have to worry about another what about baseball movie

356
00:22:40,128 --> 00:22:41,408
Plenty of that baseball

357
00:22:42,176 --> 00:22:48,320
Rookie of the Year NBA Rookie of the Year in Rookie of the Year

358
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:52,416
All-time great reveals that the glove was actually his mom

359
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:53,952
Time to play softball

360
00:22:55,232 --> 00:22:56,768
Celebrity Rehab

361
00:22:58,048 --> 00:23:00,864
I don't remember that one how did he do did he get rehab

362
00:23:01,376 --> 00:23:02,656
Seem to not think he had a problem

363
00:23:03,168 --> 00:23:07,264
Which is not surprising good place to start if I recall correctly he thought

364
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:10,848
He was he was acting like he thought he was there to be a counselor

365
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:17,504
I like that yeah I like that

366
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:18,272
Dr. true

367
00:23:19,296 --> 00:23:19,808
True

368
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:26,464
Just needed an assistant man yeah so I got called in to be like

369
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,512
I do think I would I would I be

370
00:23:28,768 --> 00:23:30,560
See how Jon Stewart would try to handle a lie

371
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:33,376
Interesting meeting of the minds

372
00:23:33,888 --> 00:23:35,424
That didn't happen

373
00:23:36,192 --> 00:23:42,080
So are you ready to find out who the big fat slimy neocon is it will Crystal

374
00:23:42,336 --> 00:23:43,104
It is not

375
00:23:43,616 --> 00:23:45,152
Is it Newt Gingrich it's not

376
00:23:45,664 --> 00:23:49,504
Not Tucker Carlson although he would have been someone that I would call that

377
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:52,320
Nope

378
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,408
We're behind

379
00:24:22,784 --> 00:24:24,576
Damn answer it's an Coulter

380
00:24:24,832 --> 00:24:27,392
So he is going to tell me

381
00:24:28,416 --> 00:24:29,696
That Ann Coulter

382
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:31,488
Supported McCarthy

383
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:37,888
And that that is a bad thing he's he wants to know if she supports McCarthy enough

384
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:44,288
Subway supporting McCarthy Isley like that's the Trojan Horse aspect of it

385
00:24:44,544 --> 00:24:50,688
Yes see other stuff like they believe in The Patriot Act and neoconservative is a all this stuff yeah

386
00:24:50,944 --> 00:24:57,088
Without that she really believes but she tricks you into liking her what with her support of McCarthy episode Alex is going

387
00:24:57,344 --> 00:25:03,488
I thought a lot of people really got trick by Ann Coulter support of MacArthur

388
00:25:03,744 --> 00:25:06,304
Mickey she's so clever like that

389
00:25:06,816 --> 00:25:08,864
I can't believe she got away with it for so long

390
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:15,264
So at this point 2003 and Coulter just released her book titled treason liberal treachery from the Cold War 2

391
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,288
To the war on terrorism

392
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:19,872
Around this time culture was at the peak of her powers as a media troll

393
00:25:20,128 --> 00:25:23,968
Who just saying things then get people mad at her to facilitate a cycle of attempt

394
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:28,064
It works really well back then far more so than now

395
00:25:28,576 --> 00:25:34,720
The book treason was in large part about how culture felt that McCarthyism was something that was created by the Liberals imagine

396
00:25:34,976 --> 00:25:37,280
McCarthy was in fact

397
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:39,584
And did a great job of rounding up communist spies

398
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:43,936
Like we have all of his words though they liked wrote them down

399
00:25:44,192 --> 00:25:49,824
Evie got this stuff isn't true but a big part of the show the show that we do here is humoring ideas

400
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:50,592
So I decided

401
00:25:51,104 --> 00:25:54,176
Let's do it I read a number of interviews that she gave around this time and

402
00:25:54,432 --> 00:26:00,576
The thing that she seems to point to as our primary evidence that McCarthy was right is the 1995 release of the venona intercept

403
00:26:00,832 --> 00:26:04,928
Peter translated cables that have been captured by us intelligence in like 19

404
00:26:05,184 --> 00:26:05,696
M40

405
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:12,352
The venona intercepts are actually very fascinating and they paint a picture about the scope of Soviet intelligence projects during the Cold War

406
00:26:12,864 --> 00:26:14,144
There's something

407
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,192
Definitely could be used to demonstrate

408
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:19,776
Instant that Julius and Ethel Rosenberg

409
00:26:20,032 --> 00:26:20,800
In fact Soviet spy

410
00:26:21,056 --> 00:26:24,384
Yes that was true I found that out whenever I read about

411
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,944
Interceptor do definitely back

412
00:26:27,968 --> 00:26:34,112
There definitely was some indication that there were few people within government who were Cooperative with the Soviet Union and providing

413
00:26:34,368 --> 00:26:34,880
With information

414
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:35,648
That is all

415
00:26:35,904 --> 00:26:37,696
Assessment

416
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:40,256
Go so far as to prove Joseph

417
00:26:40,512 --> 00:26:43,840
McCarthy to be on the up-and-up is not supported by the information

418
00:26:44,864 --> 00:26:47,680
McCarthy was a raving lunatic with a penchant for public

419
00:26:48,448 --> 00:26:54,336
Do a lot of the fervor round to Auntie communist witch-hunt in there. They're so sweet at the house on American Activities Committee

420
00:26:54,592 --> 00:26:58,432
McCarthy himself presided over the Senate permanent subcommittee on investigations

421
00:26:58,944 --> 00:27:00,736
Would you use to grandstand against the ledge

422
00:27:00,992 --> 00:27:01,504
Communist

423
00:27:02,272 --> 00:27:06,880
In the transcript of his hearings between 1953 and 1950 for all of Vail Ebola

424
00:27:07,136 --> 00:27:08,672
Great picture of the man

425
00:27:09,184 --> 00:27:14,560
View transcripts probably weren't available to Ann Coulter at the time of the writing of the book though since they were only made public in

426
00:27:14,816 --> 00:27:16,352
2003

427
00:27:16,864 --> 00:27:17,888
This book is probably written

428
00:27:18,144 --> 00:27:19,424
The most Spotify

429
00:27:19,936 --> 00:27:26,080
That being said even for 2003 there's plenty of public information that would lead someone to assess McCarthy is being an idiot.

430
00:27:26,336 --> 00:27:26,848
Piece of s***

431
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:30,944
It's once imagined he was just trying to find out the Communist spies in the government

432
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:34,272
But you have to recognise he was also doing stuff like the following

433
00:27:34,784 --> 00:27:35,296
Quote

434
00:27:35,552 --> 00:27:41,696
The state Department's International Information agency operated several overseas libraries that were freely available to citizens

435
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:42,464
The host countries

436
00:27:42,976 --> 00:27:46,304
McCarthy declared them to be Soviet tools because there were books

437
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:49,376
Show me libraries author by Communists in their quote fellow Travelers

438
00:27:50,144 --> 00:27:56,288
He harassed the library so fiercely as communist propagating tools that some of the library's actually burn the book

439
00:27:56,544 --> 00:27:58,592
Books written by authors McCarthy deep to be subversive

440
00:28:01,664 --> 00:28:03,200
At no point in time

441
00:28:03,456 --> 00:28:07,296
At no point in time are we going to get a hundred percent of people saying

442
00:28:07,552 --> 00:28:09,088
Burning books is a dumb idea

443
00:28:09,344 --> 00:28:10,880
We just never going to get there

444
00:28:11,392 --> 00:28:15,232
You can you can get most people on board January

445
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,560
So we've got into McCarthy a bit in the past I don't want to go to

446
00:28:18,816 --> 00:28:20,096
Too far down that road again but

447
00:28:20,352 --> 00:28:25,984
I just really interested when I heard Alex say that he was wanting to give Ann Coulter some kind of the McCarthy purity test

448
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:32,640
Signature defended him based on the venona intercepts just going to let down a weird Road of looking into this Alexia Nicole

449
00:28:32,896 --> 00:28:34,432
Does actually does backup sump

450
00:28:34,688 --> 00:28:37,760
I'm stopping at like there were right there word Soviet

451
00:28:38,272 --> 00:28:44,416
Spies going to surprise me and be like I'm going to give her a litmus test on McCarthy did you like blood

452
00:28:44,672 --> 00:28:46,208
Meridian mulatto like that kind of dough

453
00:28:46,464 --> 00:28:50,816
A lot of stuff doesn't even come up in Alex's interview which is like 50 top

454
00:28:52,864 --> 00:28:59,008
Yeah but it's just weird that citing the Winona intercept is a fairly solid way to argue that there were so

455
00:28:59,264 --> 00:29:04,896
Soviet spies running around in the cold war. I've literally never heard Alex bring them up

456
00:29:06,432 --> 00:29:11,552
That is weird looking into a culture in her arguments in favor of McCarthy are the first time

457
00:29:11,808 --> 00:29:12,832
That they have ever come up

458
00:29:13,088 --> 00:29:19,232
In any of the things on the Shelf

459
00:29:20,256 --> 00:29:20,768
Offended

460
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:22,560
It is

461
00:29:22,816 --> 00:29:23,328
Maybe that's why I

462
00:29:23,584 --> 00:29:24,352
Can't have it

463
00:29:25,376 --> 00:29:27,168
Yeah but I think it also is evidence that

464
00:29:27,424 --> 00:29:29,728
Has a finite point

465
00:29:29,984 --> 00:29:30,752
Utility

466
00:29:31,264 --> 00:29:33,056
Like you can't use it to argue

467
00:29:33,312 --> 00:29:34,848
Like he likes to that

468
00:29:35,104 --> 00:29:35,616
McCarthy

469
00:29:36,128 --> 00:29:38,176
Found that the globalist we're running

470
00:29:38,432 --> 00:29:40,224
Or whatever

471
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:44,576
Those are things you really need evidence for cuz they're you know you're not going to have that at

472
00:29:44,832 --> 00:29:48,160
Yeah things like there's no Nature Center like those are real they exist

473
00:29:48,672 --> 00:29:49,952
And they get you

474
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:51,488
This far

475
00:29:51,744 --> 00:29:53,536
Router

476
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:58,912
No I didn't say almost by Omission make McCarthy look like an even more insane person

477
00:29:59,424 --> 00:30:05,568
Considering

478
00:30:05,824 --> 00:30:07,360
Haters can't work

479
00:30:08,128 --> 00:30:10,176
We get to

480
00:30:10,432 --> 00:30:11,712
Bringing a Coulter in

481
00:30:11,968 --> 00:30:14,016
At this is a meeting of the minds my friend

482
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:44,224
I thought you was going to destroy this seems pretty

483
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,528
Very collegial starting off who's polite

484
00:30:46,784 --> 00:30:47,808
Kind of fun

485
00:30:49,088 --> 00:30:50,368
I mean easy breezy

486
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:55,232
Oh you know the twin the Trojan Horse came in they had a nice party that's the same thing

487
00:30:56,768 --> 00:30:58,048
Before we destroy it

488
00:30:58,560 --> 00:30:59,584
Maybe maybe

489
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:00,352
Who knows

490
00:31:04,448 --> 00:31:04,960
About

491
00:31:14,432 --> 00:31:14,944
By the sea

492
00:31:31,328 --> 00:31:37,472
But it's the shows so above the left-right paradigm

493
00:31:37,728 --> 00:31:40,032
Anyways I love you too

494
00:31:40,544 --> 00:31:43,360
It just seemed a bit more friendly than I expected I

495
00:31:43,616 --> 00:31:47,712
Kind of felt like oh okay Alex was talkin big hoping the person would

496
00:31:47,968 --> 00:31:51,040
We wouldn't have to do the interview but it's happening

497
00:31:51,808 --> 00:31:57,952
There's a big star at this point she's got a lot of pull that yeah he can grab onto if she likes him

498
00:31:58,208 --> 00:31:59,232
What was going to happen

499
00:31:59,488 --> 00:32:02,048
I was wrong This falls apart really hard

500
00:32:03,328 --> 00:32:04,352
It starts out even like

501
00:32:04,864 --> 00:32:06,912
You're just being a kiss ass

502
00:32:07,168 --> 00:32:08,192
Sycophantic

503
00:32:08,704 --> 00:32:09,472
But pretty quick

504
00:32:09,728 --> 00:32:10,496
Alex S2

505
00:32:10,752 --> 00:32:12,032
You know clear-the-air

506
00:32:12,288 --> 00:32:12,800
Look

507
00:32:13,568 --> 00:32:14,080
Lady

508
00:32:14,848 --> 00:32:16,128
Oberon Paul type of

509
00:32:16,384 --> 00:32:19,456
Time to get this I need you to know this upfront

510
00:32:26,624 --> 00:32:27,648
Conservative black

511
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:35,072
Confirmative

512
00:32:44,288 --> 00:32:44,800
Respond

513
00:32:50,944 --> 00:32:51,456
Borders

514
00:33:03,488 --> 00:33:04,000
Whatever

515
00:33:20,128 --> 00:33:20,640
Don't want

516
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:55,456
I Hold On

517
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:00,832
Soccer moms out there

518
00:34:04,416 --> 00:34:05,696
But but

519
00:34:09,536 --> 00:34:10,048
Wow

520
00:34:10,304 --> 00:34:16,448
So I mean it's mildly confrontational but I think is a little spicier

521
00:34:16,704 --> 00:34:21,568
Comment that the president can only really do 23 like three things

522
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:23,104
Best kind of telling

523
00:34:23,616 --> 00:34:26,944
If she's trying to make excuses for Bush by saying you shouldn't be judged

524
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:30,016
Except for based on the three issues he's decided to focus on

525
00:34:30,528 --> 00:34:36,672
Shouldn't she have the same latitude that for any politician any Democrat president

526
00:34:36,928 --> 00:34:43,072
And the biggest issue could be let's a reducing regulation but that wasn't one of the three issues that Obama decided to focus on

527
00:34:43,584 --> 00:34:46,400
Shouldn't she have the same kind of what can you do attitude towards it

528
00:34:46,912 --> 00:34:51,520
Because a pretty transparent dodging of the question I'm pretty glad that Alex just didn't let it stand

529
00:34:51,776 --> 00:34:53,568
Do you know like that

530
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:58,176
Of course Alex's objection to her answer isn't going to be anything close to where I'm coming from

531
00:34:58,432 --> 00:35:00,480
But at least he's not giving up on it entirely

532
00:35:00,992 --> 00:35:03,296
You know there is yeah yeah more like hold on

533
00:35:03,808 --> 00:35:06,112
No that's that's some bulshit

534
00:35:06,368 --> 00:35:07,392
President

535
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:14,304
When you elect somebody to run a several trillion-dollar Enterprise per year called the America

536
00:35:14,816 --> 00:35:15,584
Government

537
00:35:16,096 --> 00:35:19,424
What you want to make sure they can only do is focus on three out of

538
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:25,056
The 10 million possible things going on at any given point

539
00:35:25,312 --> 00:35:28,384
To what she saying in terms of being a public advocate

540
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:29,152
About

541
00:35:29,664 --> 00:35:35,040
Every political capital is one of the ways

542
00:35:35,296 --> 00:35:40,160
There are only three things that he can focus on your Administration if you're good at delegating thing

543
00:35:40,672 --> 00:35:44,000
Can have other priorities that you're working towards a senior State Department

544
00:35:44,256 --> 00:35:50,400
Is invested in X Y and Z sure your department of the Interior is doing all this stuff your education

545
00:35:50,656 --> 00:35:52,448
Departments

546
00:35:52,704 --> 00:35:58,848
Like there is a lot that the president could delegate but yeah I guess I wouldn't say they can only spoke

547
00:35:59,104 --> 00:35:59,872
Focus on three things

548
00:36:00,128 --> 00:36:03,200
But in terms of what you can publicly really

549
00:36:03,712 --> 00:36:04,224
Make

550
00:36:06,016 --> 00:36:09,344
Awareness towards maybe three maybe four

551
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:12,672
There is a limited amount of time that a president has

552
00:36:12,928 --> 00:36:15,488
Advocate publicly for thing

553
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,072
And I do think that she makes a fine point that it is up to

554
00:36:19,584 --> 00:36:20,864
You know the conservative

555
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:23,424
Folk in America just to convince

556
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:24,704
Their fellow voters

557
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:27,776
To go along with this shirt like whatever they think is

558
00:36:29,568 --> 00:36:31,872
Platform people should be going toward true

559
00:36:32,128 --> 00:36:32,896
True but

560
00:36:33,664 --> 00:36:39,552
Is one of the stunning aspects of American politics indirectly politics in general

561
00:36:40,064 --> 00:36:42,368
Ace how often presidents are insisting

562
00:36:43,136 --> 00:36:43,904
Insistent

563
00:36:44,416 --> 00:36:50,560
That the buck does not stop their solutely not it's not my fault I've only ridden I've only got

564
00:36:50,816 --> 00:36:52,096
Only focus on three things at the

565
00:36:52,352 --> 00:36:54,656
You know I got this going on I got that going on

566
00:36:54,912 --> 00:36:58,752
You don't have to hold me responsible for all the stuff I delegate you know that kind of

567
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:00,032
Anything and that's kind of what

568
00:37:00,544 --> 00:37:01,824
Hearing again and again in a

569
00:37:02,592 --> 00:37:03,104
Yeah

570
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,640
Yeah it's

571
00:37:05,152 --> 00:37:06,944
I take issue with

572
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,224
The point that she's making

573
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:10,272
A different

574
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:13,856
Version of the point cheese-making I think I could see where it was

575
00:37:17,184 --> 00:37:18,464
Yes but he was Alex's abject

576
00:37:35,616 --> 00:37:36,896
What is oppa

577
00:37:37,152 --> 00:37:37,664
Borders

578
00:37:38,432 --> 00:37:39,200
Apartment

579
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,856
Oh no

580
00:37:46,112 --> 00:37:49,696
YouTube grifters can't be asking to Define terms

581
00:37:49,952 --> 00:37:56,096
Kryptonite is definition

582
00:37:56,352 --> 00:37:57,120
Does open borders make

583
00:37:57,376 --> 00:38:01,216
What do any of our buzzwords mean also

584
00:38:01,728 --> 00:38:03,776
Alex's objection seems to be like

585
00:38:04,032 --> 00:38:05,056
Things that bush didn't

586
00:38:05,312 --> 00:38:05,824
End up doing

587
00:38:08,384 --> 00:38:08,896
Okay

588
00:38:09,152 --> 00:38:11,968
Well he's afraid of

589
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:18,624
Which don't happen the left-right Paradigm in above the left-right Paradigm you don't have to worry about all the reality that

590
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,160
Set the left-right Paradigm deals with

591
00:38:20,416 --> 00:38:26,560
Above the left right there. I'm you're just worried that everyone isn't going to be as extreme right as you want the right

592
00:38:26,816 --> 00:38:31,168
You're just looking at it we are gremlins all over the place

593
00:38:31,424 --> 00:38:32,704
Instinct was right

594
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:33,984
Alex's

595
00:38:34,752 --> 00:38:35,776
Does not want to have

596
00:38:36,032 --> 00:38:37,056
To Define things

597
00:38:37,824 --> 00:38:38,848
Funny fails

598
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:41,152
Borders

599
00:39:16,992 --> 00:39:17,504
Service Pro

600
00:39:29,536 --> 00:39:30,048
Bushisms

601
00:39:30,304 --> 00:39:31,072
Doing everything

602
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:39,264
I think I clip is super revealing

603
00:39:39,776 --> 00:39:44,384
The first thing you see is that Alex can't Define what you mean by open borders and any sensible

604
00:39:44,896 --> 00:39:48,736
Already here is not the equivalent of open

605
00:39:48,992 --> 00:39:49,504
Running the borders

606
00:39:50,016 --> 00:39:51,808
The only other thing he could even come up with

607
00:39:52,064 --> 00:39:54,112
Was the bush supported the Pan-American Union

608
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:57,184
None of this amounts to open borders and I

609
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:58,464
Alex is going to need to

610
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:00,768
Define what do you mean by panamerican Union

611
00:40:01,024 --> 00:40:02,304
Because that definitely is

612
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:04,096
Existed for a long time

613
00:40:04,608 --> 00:40:07,936
In 1889 the first International Conference of the America

614
00:40:08,192 --> 00:40:09,728
Can States was held in d.c.

615
00:40:09,984 --> 00:40:16,128
This was quota for the purpose of discussing and recommending for adoption to their respective governments some plan of arbiter

616
00:40:16,384 --> 00:40:19,200
Operation for the settlement of disagreements and disputes that may

617
00:40:19,456 --> 00:40:21,248
Hereafter arise between them

618
00:40:21,504 --> 00:40:24,320
A considering questions relating to the Improvement of business

619
00:40:24,576 --> 00:40:25,088
Intercourse

620
00:40:25,344 --> 00:40:26,880
It means of direct communication

621
00:40:27,136 --> 00:40:28,160
Between said countries

622
00:40:28,416 --> 00:40:31,744
And to encourage sup such reciprocal commercial relations

623
00:40:32,256 --> 00:40:34,048
As will be beneficial to all

624
00:40:34,304 --> 00:40:35,584
Insecure more expensive markets

625
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:37,376
Through the product of each that Nation

626
00:40:37,888 --> 00:40:42,496
If Alice is going to be mad about anybody at this over the stove you should take it up with Benjamin Harrison

627
00:40:42,752 --> 00:40:44,288
Yeah that guy was a real dick

628
00:40:44,544 --> 00:40:50,688
Out of this conference the international Union of American Republic was founded which would go on to be named the Panama

629
00:40:50,944 --> 00:40:54,016
Union became the organization of America

630
00:40:54,272 --> 00:40:54,784
Can States

631
00:40:55,296 --> 00:41:00,416
I wasn't worried about a Pan American Unity just worried that bush is going to let more non-white people into the country

632
00:41:00,928 --> 00:41:03,488
But even so here's a terrible grass by being able to

633
00:41:03,744 --> 00:41:06,304
Depends what is really strong accusation

634
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:08,352
Bush Sports open border

635
00:41:09,376 --> 00:41:14,496
On some level Alex knows that he can't backup that Hyperbole and an is called him out on it to Define his terms

636
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:16,800
Without admitting the bush

637
00:41:17,056 --> 00:41:23,200
Isn't actually in favor of open borders as he wants the audience to understand the term right

638
00:41:23,456 --> 00:41:23,968
Spam

639
00:41:24,736 --> 00:41:27,040
Alex doesn't really have good information to go on here

640
00:41:27,296 --> 00:41:31,392
Only can throw out is that the NRA put out an alert that they think bush is going to band

641
00:41:31,648 --> 00:41:32,160
Assault weapons

642
00:41:32,672 --> 00:41:33,184
Really weak

643
00:41:34,208 --> 00:41:38,816
It's interesting how I am can see the point because I think she gets the sense that it's not even worth arguing

644
00:41:39,072 --> 00:41:42,656
So she retreats to be very reasonable point that a president can only do so much and

645
00:41:42,912 --> 00:41:44,192
I have to consider getting re-elected

646
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,752
I think here we can see a fundamental

647
00:41:47,008 --> 00:41:49,568
Princeton House someone like and Coulter it someone like Alex Jones

648
00:41:49,824 --> 00:41:50,592
Understands power

649
00:41:50,848 --> 00:41:51,360
And Leadership

650
00:41:52,128 --> 00:41:54,943
The president is part of a process

651
00:41:55,455 --> 00:41:58,015
You're picking up where your predecessor left off and you're going

652
00:41:58,271 --> 00:41:59,551
Going to leave the next president the circle

653
00:41:59,807 --> 00:42:01,087
Stances that your term ends in

654
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:06,463
You can do a lot but ultimately you can alienate the voters who determine whether you'll stay in office

655
00:42:07,231 --> 00:42:11,327
You have to make concessions and recognize that imperfect compromises might need to be struck

656
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:13,887
Someone like Alex doesn't b l that way

657
00:42:14,143 --> 00:42:17,215
He really does ascribe to a strongman dictator molding

658
00:42:17,471 --> 00:42:18,495
In terms of people he likes

659
00:42:18,751 --> 00:42:19,775
Want to be in charge

660
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:21,055
Common

661
00:42:21,311 --> 00:42:24,639
With a set of Educators to Alex's social and political preferences

662
00:42:25,663 --> 00:42:27,967
Place whatever whether or not most people wanted

663
00:42:28,735 --> 00:42:33,087
We saw this play out with trumpet even back at this point is supporter Ron Paul is a lot of similarities

664
00:42:33,855 --> 00:42:39,999
Because he's never been president we don't know if you'd actually follow through with it but Alex has every reason to think that the day Ron Paul

665
00:42:40,255 --> 00:42:40,767
Got into office

666
00:42:41,023 --> 00:42:43,327
He unilaterally withdraw from the UN

667
00:42:43,583 --> 00:42:49,727
He get rid of pretty much every social welfare program shutdown OSHA and eliminate all four and eight

668
00:42:49,983 --> 00:42:54,591
Fantasy what Ron Paul for him we never had to test the theory of whether or not he would do it

669
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:59,199
And on the other hand has had experiences in the actual political world

670
00:42:59,967 --> 00:43:01,759
And she's a politician Street supported

671
00:43:02,015 --> 00:43:02,527
Become president

672
00:43:03,295 --> 00:43:04,831
Because she's very close to the actual working

673
00:43:05,087 --> 00:43:08,927
The politics doesn't have the same delusional idealism that Alex had 2003

674
00:43:09,183 --> 00:43:11,231
And I'd still had about Rob

675
00:43:11,487 --> 00:43:12,767
Although he's threatening that

676
00:43:13,023 --> 00:43:14,303
Discount this one's have 20 more times

677
00:43:15,071 --> 00:43:18,399
Any number of times now is going to be the last drop

678
00:43:18,911 --> 00:43:21,983
I'm not certain that means much but I really feel like this difference came through in the

679
00:43:22,239 --> 00:43:23,263
This chunk of their conversation

680
00:43:23,775 --> 00:43:27,871
Alex says this delusional expectation that bush do things that he's not

681
00:43:28,127 --> 00:43:29,151
Doing already

682
00:43:29,407 --> 00:43:32,223
Where is pragmatism towards the political process

683
00:43:33,247 --> 00:43:34,783
At this point I was like she's going to win

684
00:43:35,551 --> 00:43:36,063
Oh really

685
00:43:36,575 --> 00:43:37,855
This is not good

686
00:43:38,111 --> 00:43:40,927
It does not appear to be going well for Alex

687
00:43:41,183 --> 00:43:41,695
Right out of the

688
00:43:41,951 --> 00:43:48,095
It does not seem like he's going to eviscerate her in front of the audience in order to dance upon her bone

689
00:43:48,351 --> 00:43:52,447
For him this would be a point where I'm starting to walk back my position

690
00:43:52,703 --> 00:43:53,983
Get real polite again

691
00:43:54,239 --> 00:43:57,823
Get real polite again you know what let's talk more about your book

692
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:04,223
Talk let's talk extensive amazing let's talk about how great

693
00:44:06,783 --> 00:44:07,807
Give me serve you

694
00:44:08,063 --> 00:44:12,671
Making a point that I actually think it's a really good and insightful about Alex

695
00:44:13,439 --> 00:44:14,207
Funny conservative

696
00:44:26,239 --> 00:44:27,263
The problem with this is

697
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:53,119
Build

698
00:44:55,423 --> 00:44:57,215
How to never agree with it but I think

699
00:44:57,471 --> 00:45:01,311
And is fairly right and accusing Alex of insisting that bush do everything for him

700
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:05,919
In the past I wouldn't have looked at it this way necessarily because I'm anyways

701
00:45:06,175 --> 00:45:11,039
Alex is doing something that could be described as politically active the way that I like

702
00:45:11,295 --> 00:45:14,111
Political beliefs

703
00:45:14,367 --> 00:45:16,671
Do the line was suggesting people do

704
00:45:17,183 --> 00:45:23,071
Is there too because Alison show is basically just complaining about how Bush isn't doing everything that he wants them

705
00:45:23,327 --> 00:45:26,399
To do there's a passing of the Bucking Alex's politics because

706
00:45:26,655 --> 00:45:30,751
He believes that things get done by strong singular leaders as opposed to the result of

707
00:45:31,007 --> 00:45:31,775
Collective action

708
00:45:32,031 --> 00:45:33,567
Miscellaneous financial interest

709
00:45:33,823 --> 00:45:34,591
Sometimes coincidences

710
00:45:35,615 --> 00:45:41,247
Bush signing the assault weapons ban which he didn't do wouldn't be the result of a ton of influences like millions of people elect

711
00:45:41,503 --> 00:45:42,271
Members of Congress

712
00:45:42,527 --> 00:45:48,159
Who would pass legislation for Bush to sign in the first place horse special interest groups lobbying for or against the bill

713
00:45:48,415 --> 00:45:52,255
It would just be a matter of bush doing this to us because he's bad

714
00:45:52,767 --> 00:45:57,887
If boys were good then the millions of Voters of the majorities in Congress of the lobbying groups they wouldn't matter

715
00:45:58,143 --> 00:46:00,959
He would just do whatever Alex believe it was right even if

716
00:46:01,215 --> 00:46:02,239
So my problem

717
00:46:02,495 --> 00:46:03,775
Ridiculous political conflict

718
00:46:04,543 --> 00:46:06,079
Possibly torpedoing his own career

719
00:46:06,847 --> 00:46:11,455
Is enticing to think of Alex's habit of looking at his favorite politicians is an all-powerful daddy like it

720
00:46:11,711 --> 00:46:12,479
It started with Trump

721
00:46:12,735 --> 00:46:13,759
I don't know I don't like

722
00:46:14,015 --> 00:46:16,063
The future is probably there a little bit to consist

723
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:20,415
Yeah that is a that I mean to a certain

724
00:46:20,671 --> 00:46:21,183
Okay

725
00:46:21,695 --> 00:46:22,207
Okay

726
00:46:22,463 --> 00:46:27,071
If he if that's a function really of his same show though even in his

727
00:46:27,583 --> 00:46:28,351
In his f

728
00:46:28,863 --> 00:46:29,631
With his show

729
00:46:29,887 --> 00:46:31,935
He is consistently telling his audience

730
00:46:32,447 --> 00:46:33,471
You don't have to do any

731
00:46:34,239 --> 00:46:37,055
You give me the money so I can do stuff

732
00:46:37,567 --> 00:46:41,151
So in essence his political ideology is well I'm not

733
00:46:41,407 --> 00:46:42,175
The politician

734
00:46:42,431 --> 00:46:43,967
So my job is to

735
00:46:44,223 --> 00:46:45,503
Support whomever

736
00:46:45,759 --> 00:46:48,831
For them to do it for me in the same way that my listeners give me money

737
00:46:49,087 --> 00:46:50,111
So I can do both

738
00:46:50,879 --> 00:46:52,927
So it seems like an almost

739
00:46:53,183 --> 00:46:55,231
121 explanation for how he

740
00:46:55,487 --> 00:46:57,279
He thinks everything operates sure

741
00:46:57,791 --> 00:47:00,351
They're also there also seems to be like

742
00:47:00,607 --> 00:47:03,167
I guess the idea would be

743
00:47:03,423 --> 00:47:07,775
To use the political organizing of Alex's show like there's enough listeners

744
00:47:08,287 --> 00:47:09,311
And if they vote

745
00:47:09,567 --> 00:47:10,079
Weekend

746
00:47:10,335 --> 00:47:15,711
Vote for the person who will do everything we want them to do right

747
00:47:19,039 --> 00:47:21,087
Play idealistic in a wave it like

748
00:47:21,343 --> 00:47:22,367
I guess I

749
00:47:22,623 --> 00:47:25,183
I don't dress nearly enough

750
00:47:25,439 --> 00:47:29,535
We could we could theoretically vote for somebody who wanted Universal Health Care

751
00:47:30,815 --> 00:47:32,095
But apparently we won't

752
00:47:32,607 --> 00:47:34,911
The goal is

753
00:47:35,167 --> 00:47:37,471
How to convince people to vote

754
00:47:37,727 --> 00:47:38,495
For people who would

755
00:47:40,799 --> 00:47:41,823
So I'm Alex

756
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:46,431
Brings up a a bill that bush didn't beat out

757
00:47:46,687 --> 00:47:48,479
Just a little bit confused

758
00:47:49,247 --> 00:47:51,295
Barbara Boxer

759
00:47:57,951 --> 00:47:58,719
Now

760
00:48:10,495 --> 00:48:11,263
Because

761
00:48:22,015 --> 00:48:26,367
Alex is almost going to sell

762
00:48:27,647 --> 00:48:33,791
A wrench so big was thrown into his brain he's now agreeing with her too.

763
00:48:34,047 --> 00:48:34,815
Defeat himself

764
00:48:35,071 --> 00:48:40,703
Yeah so he realizes that he's made a point really well

765
00:48:44,543 --> 00:48:45,311
Neymar

766
00:49:03,999 --> 00:49:06,047
Look I do in my butt

767
00:49:06,303 --> 00:49:07,327
Advising your audio

768
00:49:07,583 --> 00:49:08,607
We need to persuade

769
00:49:17,055 --> 00:49:18,335
This is what

770
00:49:27,807 --> 00:49:28,831
Real dickish

771
00:49:29,343 --> 00:49:32,159
A mascot

772
00:49:32,415 --> 00:49:38,559
And the reason that you the mascot is cuz she's an intelligent conservative woman I was going to say that what he just told her is

773
00:49:38,815 --> 00:49:44,959
Is that your are token intelligent woman and obviously when we do have power if it's cuz it's

774
00:49:45,215 --> 00:49:45,727
Consolidated

775
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:47,007
You will not be involved

776
00:49:47,263 --> 00:49:51,871
Are you willing to be involved is Alaska

777
00:49:52,127 --> 00:49:53,663
Rivoli excuse me

778
00:49:53,919 --> 00:49:55,711
I would like you to verify real quick

779
00:49:55,967 --> 00:49:58,271
The only thing the far-right cares about is your gender

780
00:49:58,527 --> 00:50:02,623
Because you're not saying anything new baby that's pretty much

781
00:50:09,279 --> 00:50:11,327
Deserves that kind of thing from Alex

782
00:50:11,583 --> 00:50:12,351
From Alex

783
00:50:12,607 --> 00:50:13,119
Snow

784
00:50:14,399 --> 00:50:16,191
Alex keep bringing up like

785
00:50:16,447 --> 00:50:19,007
Why is Budweiser weapons ban

786
00:50:19,263 --> 00:50:22,079
Yeah yeah

787
00:50:23,615 --> 00:50:25,151
Only able to do so much

788
00:50:25,407 --> 00:50:30,783
I can only answer this question the same way so many times we have you can bring up other examples

789
00:50:31,039 --> 00:50:34,111
Anime answer will be the same

790
00:50:34,367 --> 00:50:40,511
What about that time that he went to that bar with a buddy who wasn't a friend of mine that guy was a real a****** is he an ass-whole

791
00:50:40,767 --> 00:50:44,863
Alright dammit starting to get a little bit annoyed

792
00:50:56,895 --> 00:50:57,663
You're not saying this

793
00:51:23,007 --> 00:51:25,823
I don't agree with what she's saying but like in terms of

794
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:27,103
How she's responding

795
00:51:27,359 --> 00:51:29,663
Alright

796
00:51:29,919 --> 00:51:34,271
One question of

797
00:51:34,527 --> 00:51:35,551
Over and over again

798
00:51:35,807 --> 00:51:38,879
Totally clear and even

799
00:51:39,135 --> 00:51:43,231
Barely polite with Alex being kind of a dick calling her cuz she's intelligent

800
00:51:44,511 --> 00:51:49,375
Again I hate Ann Coulter but in conversation with Alex she comes off like a less of an a****** interpersonally

801
00:51:49,631 --> 00:51:52,191
I'm more of a person who actually knows how to convey her point

802
00:51:52,959 --> 00:51:54,751
I want to talk for a second about UNESCO though

803
00:51:55,263 --> 00:51:59,871
The organization was founded in 1946 in the United States was a founding member

804
00:52:00,639 --> 00:52:06,783
1984 during the Reagan Administration the US withdrew from UNESCO and it's historically fairly open

805
00:52:07,039 --> 00:52:09,087
Question about whether or not that was inappropriate

806
00:52:10,111 --> 00:52:11,135
There were some complaints

807
00:52:11,391 --> 00:52:12,927
Mismanagement by the event director

808
00:52:13,183 --> 00:52:14,719
General Tso

809
00:52:14,975 --> 00:52:17,279
It might not have been a totally frivolous decision

810
00:52:17,535 --> 00:52:21,631
But either way in 1995 we've seen a change in leadership UNESCO

811
00:52:21,887 --> 00:52:23,167
And A Renewed interest

812
00:52:23,423 --> 00:52:24,191
In rejoining

813
00:52:24,703 --> 00:52:25,471
President Clinton

814
00:52:25,727 --> 00:52:28,799
Indicated that he wanted to rejoin at this point but he was limited in his ability

815
00:52:29,055 --> 00:52:30,079
Did you so by budgetary

816
00:52:30,335 --> 00:52:30,847
Constraints

817
00:52:31,359 --> 00:52:33,919
As he left office you requested that bush rejoin

818
00:52:34,175 --> 00:52:34,687
Which he did

819
00:52:34,943 --> 00:52:35,967
In late 2003

820
00:52:36,735 --> 00:52:42,111
It's true that Bush was inclined to rejoin but he honestly couldn't have done it on his own unilaterally

821
00:52:42,623 --> 00:52:43,391
In order to join

822
00:52:43,647 --> 00:52:44,927
Funding had to be appropriate

823
00:52:45,183 --> 00:52:46,719
Which was done by an act of Congress

824
00:52:47,231 --> 00:52:50,559
It wasn't the active one person because the action needed to be

825
00:52:50,815 --> 00:52:52,607
The action needed other things

826
00:52:53,119 --> 00:52:55,423
Had to make it happen there were multiple parts

827
00:52:55,935 --> 00:52:58,239
There's like more than one branch of government

828
00:52:58,495 --> 00:53:04,639
And it goes through

829
00:53:04,895 --> 00:53:05,919
Actually a bit of a bummer

830
00:53:06,431 --> 00:53:11,039
Ron Paul tried to get the us out of it every year he was in the house and each time it went nowhere

831
00:53:11,551 --> 00:53:16,159
Then in 2011 UNESCO allowed Palestine and is a member state

832
00:53:16,415 --> 00:53:18,463
And that was a huge problem for the United States

833
00:53:18,975 --> 00:53:22,047
We just decided to stop paying Nesco

834
00:53:22,303 --> 00:53:25,119
And in 2013 they stripped the United States of voting rights

835
00:53:25,887 --> 00:53:32,031
Madden 2017 drop State Department announced again

836
00:53:32,287 --> 00:53:32,799
Billion dollars

837
00:53:33,055 --> 00:53:34,335
Unpaid dues

838
00:53:34,591 --> 00:53:36,383
Ivan

839
00:53:36,639 --> 00:53:37,151
Great

840
00:53:37,407 --> 00:53:42,527
Great school great roommate for the rest of the world I think we're best bros

841
00:53:43,551 --> 00:53:48,927
Wait what am I big Point here is that bush signing onto UNESCO isn't some kind of a single event that happened

842
00:53:49,183 --> 00:53:50,719
The tireli motivated by Bush himself

843
00:53:51,231 --> 00:53:53,791
It's a piece of a larger picture that Alex just doesn't

844
00:53:54,047 --> 00:53:56,095
Pandelis just refuses to deal with it

845
00:53:56,607 --> 00:53:58,655
Yeah and it's a really depressing picture

846
00:53:59,167 --> 00:54:05,055
You know it's a really dumb picture that it's entirely possible that Nancy Reagan's astrologist told

847
00:54:05,311 --> 00:54:06,847
Ronald f******

848
00:54:07,103 --> 00:54:07,615
I got

849
00:54:08,383 --> 00:54:14,527
Soup for brains that we should get right out of UNESCO and that's all that you needed to do

850
00:54:14,783 --> 00:54:15,807
Total fairness

851
00:54:16,319 --> 00:54:19,647
The arguments in that point in the 80s

852
00:54:20,159 --> 00:54:23,231
For getting out more sensible

853
00:54:23,487 --> 00:54:25,023
Is that a lot of other decision Shore

854
00:54:27,327 --> 00:54:28,607
But yeah it's this point

855
00:54:29,119 --> 00:54:30,911
Starting to get a little bit like

856
00:54:31,423 --> 00:54:31,935
I don't do that

857
00:54:32,191 --> 00:54:33,215
I guess you just like

858
00:54:33,471 --> 00:54:35,007
Realizing where she is

859
00:54:35,263 --> 00:54:39,615
Yeah it's kind of like this isn't good I thought it was going to be promoting my book

860
00:54:39,871 --> 00:54:41,407
She had no idea who Alex

861
00:54:41,919 --> 00:54:43,199
Yeah it pretty clear

862
00:54:43,455 --> 00:54:49,599
It's very obvious that she really thought this was going to be a boilerplate radio appearances like that

863
00:54:49,855 --> 00:54:52,159
A radio person about her book

864
00:54:52,415 --> 00:54:57,791
Safe is the safest possible thing for Ann Coulter to do

865
00:54:58,047 --> 00:54:59,071
Society

866
00:54:59,327 --> 00:55:03,167
She's annoyed

867
00:55:06,495 --> 00:55:08,543
We can get in the morning

868
00:55:28,255 --> 00:55:29,535
And okay I'm

869
00:55:39,007 --> 00:55:45,151
I am not going to say that I don't appreciate too monstrous children

870
00:55:45,407 --> 00:55:50,527
Bickering what you like about Coulter

871
00:55:51,039 --> 00:55:52,063
She has a whip

872
00:55:52,575 --> 00:55:55,391
She has an ability to

873
00:55:55,647 --> 00:55:58,975
Speak extemporaneously it away they can sometimes

874
00:55:59,487 --> 00:56:03,071
Chief position of

875
00:56:03,327 --> 00:56:04,607
Professional troll

876
00:56:05,887 --> 00:56:06,399
With

877
00:56:06,655 --> 00:56:09,215
The talent to become a professional douchebag

878
00:56:09,471 --> 00:56:12,031
Yeah you know used against Alex

879
00:56:12,543 --> 00:56:13,823
It's often said a little

880
00:56:16,127 --> 00:56:17,407
I just

881
00:56:17,663 --> 00:56:22,015
It does make you feel like maybe there's a certain time to tap into being a dick

882
00:56:22,271 --> 00:56:28,415
Maybe when the time is right you should have the powers of douchebag under your belt

883
00:56:28,671 --> 00:56:29,439
Joinder of like

884
00:56:29,695 --> 00:56:35,839
I've never seen her this mad at liberals I'm just bored

885
00:56:36,095 --> 00:56:38,143
You're not going to break through

886
00:56:38,399 --> 00:56:42,495
At the dinner table so are we get to the Patriot Act 2

887
00:56:42,751 --> 00:56:45,823
After this

888
00:56:46,847 --> 00:56:47,615
Just doesn't

889
00:56:47,871 --> 00:56:48,383
Give a s***

890
00:56:53,759 --> 00:56:55,039
The police

891
00:56:56,319 --> 00:56:56,831
I mean

892
00:57:23,967 --> 00:57:25,503
Let me get it for you

893
00:57:44,447 --> 00:57:45,471
Love it

894
00:57:45,983 --> 00:57:46,751
Electric razor

895
00:57:47,007 --> 00:57:48,543
No no I don't

896
00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:54,943
The earlier the interview when there were the discussion about parts of the Patriot Act and said that she hadn't read this so I can actually totally

897
00:57:55,199 --> 00:57:58,783
We see how Alex would have interpreted that as her saying that she hadn't read it at all

898
00:57:59,807 --> 00:58:02,111
Kind of wood it would be a fair reading of what

899
00:58:02,367 --> 00:58:02,879
He said right

900
00:58:03,135 --> 00:58:05,183
It is really fun. What you clarified

901
00:58:05,439 --> 00:58:07,487
That she hadn't read what he's talking about

902
00:58:07,743 --> 00:58:08,511
It also doesn't care

903
00:58:09,535 --> 00:58:12,607
We talked about this a bit the past but there was no Patriot Act 2

904
00:58:13,119 --> 00:58:15,679
The bill that Alex is referring to as Patriot Act to didn't

905
00:58:16,703 --> 00:58:20,287
Also there's no section 501 in s22 descended bill

906
00:58:20,543 --> 00:58:24,895
The first section is 1101 so this citation that he's throwing out just isn't good

907
00:58:25,919 --> 00:58:29,503
I understand that this is a proposed bill and I did and it wasn't cool

908
00:58:29,759 --> 00:58:30,527
When was a bit scary

909
00:58:30,783 --> 00:58:33,855
But it's really counterproductive for Alex to embellish it about it

910
00:58:34,111 --> 00:58:35,135
In order to take a shortcut

911
00:58:35,391 --> 00:58:36,415
How to get in the audience of Esther

912
00:58:36,927 --> 00:58:37,695
It didn't pass

913
00:58:37,951 --> 00:58:40,255
It doesn't allow the stuff Alex is claiming it does

914
00:58:40,511 --> 00:58:45,375
By this point July it's been six months and to any action has been taken on the bill

915
00:58:45,631 --> 00:58:46,399
It was introduced

916
00:58:46,655 --> 00:58:51,007
The newest Center committee is essentially a dead bill at this point in July

917
00:58:51,263 --> 00:58:52,031
To know that

918
00:58:52,543 --> 00:58:53,567
So now we go to call

919
00:58:53,823 --> 00:58:56,895
Alex realize like I'm not getting anywhere here

920
00:58:57,151 --> 00:59:01,247
Sniping at me cuz it's no good

921
00:59:06,111 --> 00:59:06,623
Who are Bella

922
00:59:09,951 --> 00:59:11,231
Oh yes Alex how you doing

923
00:59:12,255 --> 00:59:14,303
Cheyenne

924
00:59:15,327 --> 00:59:16,095
I can't help the drawing

925
00:59:16,351 --> 00:59:16,863
Analogy

926
00:59:19,679 --> 00:59:20,703
Play some business and

927
00:59:22,239 --> 00:59:23,263
Something something so I go to a

928
00:59:23,775 --> 00:59:24,799
Clerk or salesperson

929
00:59:25,567 --> 00:59:26,335
And I walk away

930
00:59:26,591 --> 00:59:27,615
Disparagement

931
00:59:27,871 --> 00:59:28,895
Sometimes no more than they do

932
00:59:30,175 --> 00:59:31,199
To be the case here without

933
00:59:31,455 --> 00:59:31,967
Hawks versus you

934
00:59:32,735 --> 00:59:35,295
Are you right

935
00:59:36,319 --> 00:59:36,831
Well

936
00:59:37,343 --> 00:59:39,135
I don't think

937
00:59:41,183 --> 00:59:41,695
Ardent

938
00:59:42,207 --> 00:59:42,975
I disagree

939
00:59:46,815 --> 00:59:47,583
Well I know but maybe

940
00:59:47,839 --> 00:59:50,399
These These are issues that you talked about evidently

941
01:00:02,175 --> 01:00:04,735
Ma'am ma'am you aren't support my president

942
01:00:18,303 --> 01:00:20,607
Colors of real assholes

943
01:00:20,863 --> 01:00:24,703
Yeah back and forth of it is no good but it's pointing the episode like

944
01:00:25,215 --> 01:00:28,031
Alex maybe was starting to win me back a little bit

945
01:00:28,287 --> 01:00:32,895
Enos is starting to show through a little more

946
01:00:33,151 --> 01:00:36,735
Supporting award not being concerned about possible rights violations and what have you

947
01:00:37,247 --> 01:00:40,831
Melo grant that I don't believe Alex is principles actually sincere here

948
01:00:41,343 --> 01:00:47,487
There plenty of instances of potentially rights violating things the Trump proposal to put into place by executive order now it's at no

949
01:00:47,743 --> 01:00:48,255
Problem with them

950
01:00:48,511 --> 01:00:54,655
Even if someone I don't fully trust the sincerity of I still find his position here more palatable and responsible than an

951
01:00:54,911 --> 01:01:01,055
Not caring about the violations of right

952
01:01:01,567 --> 01:01:05,407
You didn't know I was on that

953
01:01:06,687 --> 01:01:09,503
I I dunno I strongly disagree with

954
01:01:10,015 --> 01:01:12,063
I think the way that Alex is interacting with his like

955
01:01:12,319 --> 01:01:15,391
She's on the phone another person's on the phone with the two of them are teaming up against

956
01:01:15,647 --> 01:01:16,159
The guest

957
01:01:16,415 --> 01:01:18,975
I think it's probably poor for that

958
01:01:19,487 --> 01:01:22,047
F*** it was it's like a Sports Talk Show

959
01:01:23,327 --> 01:01:26,655
Really sounding like is somebody calling into the

960
01:01:26,911 --> 01:01:27,935
God dammit strength

961
01:01:28,191 --> 01:01:30,239
Coach for the Philadelphia Eagles and being hot

962
01:01:30,495 --> 01:01:34,079
Why didn't you run the 45 at the

963
01:01:34,591 --> 01:01:39,455
Another thing that I think is also in terms of

964
01:01:39,711 --> 01:01:41,759
I like the Alex's Leanne thing

965
01:01:42,271 --> 01:01:44,319
What where I kind of side more with Alex

966
01:01:44,575 --> 01:01:47,391
Is that Anna's very clear that she supports the war on terror

967
01:01:47,647 --> 01:01:48,415
Course

968
01:01:48,927 --> 01:01:50,207
Support the so-called

969
01:01:50,463 --> 01:01:50,975
Ministration

970
01:01:51,231 --> 01:01:51,999
Terrorism correct

971
01:01:54,815 --> 01:01:55,327
Okay well

972
01:01:55,583 --> 01:01:56,351
If that's the case

973
01:02:00,191 --> 01:02:01,215
Very critical

974
01:02:01,471 --> 01:02:01,983
Equation

975
01:02:02,495 --> 01:02:03,519
But you don't seem to know any

976
01:02:05,567 --> 01:02:06,079
Civil rights

977
01:02:06,335 --> 01:02:06,847
Violate

978
01:02:24,255 --> 01:02:25,279
That is absurd

979
01:02:44,223 --> 01:02:47,039
The Hue even fell for the sleight-of-hand metallic

980
01:02:47,295 --> 01:02:47,807
Text Deb there

981
01:02:49,343 --> 01:02:50,879
The problem with this conversation and how it's

982
01:02:51,135 --> 01:02:52,159
Been carried out is very

983
01:02:52,415 --> 01:02:52,927
Clear here

984
01:02:53,439 --> 01:02:59,583
These two people are talking about things so in precisely that a pretty decent argument could be made that they're both right and they're also

985
01:02:59,839 --> 01:03:01,631
Both correct in saying the other is wrong

986
01:03:02,399 --> 01:03:08,543
Up to this point the discussion has been about the Patriot Act and Patriot Act entirely around the notion of the in French

987
01:03:08,799 --> 01:03:10,335
Bank of American citizens

988
01:03:10,591 --> 01:03:11,103
Right

989
01:03:11,359 --> 01:03:17,247
She's looking for an example of a citizen of the United States

990
01:03:17,503 --> 01:03:21,599
Have you been cheese clearing her question that she's talked about the violation of civil rights

991
01:03:22,367 --> 01:03:28,511
Alex follows this up by saying that US citizens were taken to Camp x-ray which continues the theme of discussing US citizens

992
01:03:29,279 --> 01:03:29,791
Avenger

993
01:03:30,047 --> 01:03:33,119
Torture at Bagram International facility

994
01:03:33,375 --> 01:03:34,911
Which really complicates things

995
01:03:35,167 --> 01:03:36,959
It's because now the conversation is incoherent

996
01:03:37,727 --> 01:03:42,847
Has every reason to think they're still talking about US citizens and their rights possibly being

997
01:03:43,103 --> 01:03:45,663
So she's absolutely correct that the US didn't torture any us

998
01:03:45,919 --> 01:03:47,199
Citizens death of Bagram

999
01:03:47,711 --> 01:03:53,599
Simultaneously Alex is so used to Jumping all over the place and not staying on topic that he probably doesn't even realize that

1000
01:03:54,367 --> 01:03:58,463
He's now shifted over to talk about non US citizens in a discussion about civil rights

1001
01:03:58,975 --> 01:03:59,743
Excuse correct

1002
01:04:00,255 --> 01:04:04,351
In December 2002 our soldiers killed to citizens of Afghanistan

1003
01:04:04,607 --> 01:04:05,631
And they had been tortured

1004
01:04:06,143 --> 01:04:10,239
Both Alex and and will probably leave

1005
01:04:10,495 --> 01:04:11,775
Completely insane it wrong

1006
01:04:12,031 --> 01:04:15,359
And now it'll take this as proof that she's a liar who reject proven real

1007
01:04:15,871 --> 01:04:20,479
But it's actually just a case of people not being precise with what they're talking about and ultimately

1008
01:04:20,735 --> 01:04:22,527
And this Pacific exchange Alex's

1009
01:04:22,783 --> 01:04:23,807
Far more guilty of making

1010
01:04:24,063 --> 01:04:25,343
This conversation nonsensical

1011
01:04:26,111 --> 01:04:30,719
It's hard to tell if that's a debate strategy or his mind just doesn't have the normal guardrails that most people have

1012
01:04:30,975 --> 01:04:32,511
But either way the result is the same

1013
01:04:33,279 --> 01:04:36,095
Also Camp x-ray is a part of Guantanamo Bay

1014
01:04:36,607 --> 01:04:40,447
Yaser Hamdi was captured in Afghanistan and declared

1015
01:04:40,703 --> 01:04:41,471
An enemy combatant

1016
01:04:41,983 --> 01:04:46,335
He was raised in Saudi Arabia but I was born in Louisiana so the government claim

1017
01:04:46,591 --> 01:04:49,919
They when they held him at Camp x-ray they didn't know that he was a US citizen

1018
01:04:50,687 --> 01:04:53,759
Once it was known that he was a citizen he was sent to a jail in the United

1019
01:04:54,783 --> 01:04:58,623
According to findings in the Supreme Court opinion of a case against Donald Rumsfeld

1020
01:04:58,879 --> 01:05:00,159
You've taken to Guantanamo in

1021
01:05:00,415 --> 01:05:01,183
In January 2000

1022
01:05:01,439 --> 01:05:04,511
M2M clear that he was a citizen in April 2000

1023
01:05:04,767 --> 01:05:06,559
He was sent to Norfolk Virginia

1024
01:05:08,095 --> 01:05:09,887
According to the information that they have

1025
01:05:10,911 --> 01:05:13,215
They didn't know he was a citizenship they did find out

1026
01:05:13,471 --> 01:05:16,543
Who did not allow him to be held at Camp X right whatever you want

1027
01:05:17,055 --> 01:05:17,567
To be clear

1028
01:05:18,079 --> 01:05:19,359
I don't think that any of this is okay

1029
01:05:20,127 --> 01:05:23,199
It's just not relevant to the point Alex is trying to make

1030
01:05:23,711 --> 01:05:28,575
I would say I'm opposed to people being taken to Guantanamo US citizen or not and that I don't think

1031
01:05:28,831 --> 01:05:32,415
That this case is a anyway indicates a desire on the part of our government to put

1032
01:05:32,671 --> 01:05:33,439
Uso de something camp

1033
01:05:33,695 --> 01:05:34,719
Or establish that press

1034
01:05:35,487 --> 01:05:37,791
Nonsensical argument there having

1035
01:05:38,047 --> 01:05:38,815
Is meaningless

1036
01:05:39,327 --> 01:05:40,351
Point here is that because

1037
01:05:40,607 --> 01:05:42,911
Alex has such incompatible communication

1038
01:05:43,167 --> 01:05:47,263
It's almost impossible for them to actually have a conversation that means anything

1039
01:05:47,775 --> 01:05:50,335
And this, this is really Illustrated

1040
01:05:50,591 --> 01:05:52,127
Think about two different thing but notice

1041
01:05:52,383 --> 01:05:53,919
Notice how you responded

1042
01:05:54,175 --> 01:05:56,479
To their nonsensical incoherent conversation

1043
01:05:56,991 --> 01:05:58,783
You prioritized

1044
01:05:59,295 --> 01:06:00,831
The fact that people were tortured

1045
01:06:01,087 --> 01:06:04,671
Because that is a more important issue it realistically speaking

1046
01:06:04,927 --> 01:06:05,695
You

1047
01:06:05,951 --> 01:06:10,047
Cited with Alex you were responding to an Coulter saying that no one will

1048
01:06:10,303 --> 01:06:11,071
Was tortured to death

1049
01:06:11,327 --> 01:06:11,839
I have like

1050
01:06:12,095 --> 01:06:16,447
She's wrong Ono I was responding to Ann Coulter saying

1051
01:06:16,959 --> 01:06:21,311
Find me someone whose civil rights were violated because in my head it's like well listen

1052
01:06:21,567 --> 01:06:24,383
That doesn't prove anything towards any

1053
01:06:24,895 --> 01:06:27,455
But in America if you want to find somebody who's civil rights

1054
01:06:27,967 --> 01:06:34,111
You can find but any examples that message meant specifically as a result of the

1055
01:06:34,367 --> 01:06:37,439
Or not you could produce that

1056
01:06:37,951 --> 01:06:38,719
Person

1057
01:06:38,975 --> 01:06:42,303
Alex can't know absolutely not

1058
01:06:42,559 --> 01:06:45,375
Yeah yeah it's just a bit it's just so stupid

1059
01:06:45,631 --> 01:06:48,191
It's just that was weird being just like

1060
01:06:48,447 --> 01:06:49,215
What are we doing

1061
01:06:49,471 --> 01:06:53,055
Why are you asking me for an example of what you would think

1062
01:06:53,311 --> 01:06:55,359
It's stupid but it's also the game that Alex's play

1063
01:06:55,871 --> 01:06:59,199
He's making a claim he's not used to people challenging his client

1064
01:06:59,455 --> 01:07:00,223
His claim is challenged

1065
01:07:00,479 --> 01:07:00,991
You can't offend

1066
01:07:01,247 --> 01:07:02,527
Can't back it up at all

1067
01:07:02,783 --> 01:07:03,295
That's fast

1068
01:07:03,807 --> 01:07:04,319
Second

1069
01:07:04,575 --> 01:07:05,343
I don't believe you at all

1070
01:07:05,855 --> 01:07:06,623
I think Vick

1071
01:07:06,879 --> 01:07:08,927
You did not see the sleight-of-hand

1072
01:07:09,183 --> 01:07:10,207
From US citizen

1073
01:07:10,463 --> 01:07:12,767
Do people being tortured

1074
01:07:13,023 --> 01:07:14,815
I think it's really easy to mess

1075
01:07:15,071 --> 01:07:16,607
If you're not paying attention

1076
01:07:16,863 --> 01:07:17,375
You could

1077
01:07:17,631 --> 01:07:19,423
You could very easily or

1078
01:07:19,679 --> 01:07:22,495
Get that inside when he sang two people were tortured

1079
01:07:22,751 --> 01:07:24,287
You could be like you'd forget

1080
01:07:25,567 --> 01:07:27,359
The conversation was centered around USA

1081
01:07:27,871 --> 01:07:34,015
Right now and I understand that that is an important thing for a conversation that is trying to go somewhere

1082
01:07:34,271 --> 01:07:35,807
Is to maintain a like

1083
01:07:36,063 --> 01:07:38,367
If we're talking about US citizens citizens

1084
01:07:38,623 --> 01:07:40,159
Then we can only have a point

1085
01:07:40,671 --> 01:07:41,695
If we're both talk

1086
01:07:41,951 --> 01:07:48,095
Question I asked you was based on

1087
01:07:48,351 --> 01:07:48,863
Think about

1088
01:07:49,119 --> 01:07:53,727
Other people who wrote USA what are we doing

1089
01:07:53,983 --> 01:07:58,079
It's a pointless conversation yeah but I just don't care about US citizens versus

1090
01:07:58,335 --> 01:07:59,359
Nan says I think that's

1091
01:07:59,615 --> 01:08:05,759
It's ridiculous I am 100% for open borders I think I think I think I think I was trying to

1092
01:08:06,015 --> 01:08:09,855
But I don't care about the distinction

1093
01:08:10,367 --> 01:08:11,647
But yeah it's it's

1094
01:08:12,671 --> 01:08:14,719
Just interesting to me to see the

1095
01:08:14,975 --> 01:08:15,487
Half

1096
01:08:15,743 --> 01:08:16,767
That this goes

1097
01:08:17,279 --> 01:08:18,303
And how from an external

1098
01:08:18,559 --> 01:08:21,375
Really looking at it you can see all right here's where this

1099
01:08:21,887 --> 01:08:22,911
Is going off track

1100
01:08:23,167 --> 01:08:24,447
And neither of them really wrecked

1101
01:08:24,703 --> 01:08:25,983
You guys like the other one

1102
01:08:26,239 --> 01:08:29,055
Except am kind of does a little bit later

1103
01:08:29,311 --> 01:08:31,871
This point in the conversation they just are butting heads about

1104
01:08:32,127 --> 01:08:32,639
Completely

1105
01:08:32,895 --> 01:08:36,991
You're having different conversations with each other it does feel like Alex is

1106
01:08:37,247 --> 01:08:41,087
Trying to find a weak point and if he can find a weak point

1107
01:08:41,343 --> 01:08:46,207
Then he's going to hammer it home and never speak about anything else again so we're just getting a lot of like

1108
01:08:46,463 --> 01:08:47,487
Little pokes here in there

1109
01:08:47,999 --> 01:08:50,303
A man tries to stay on topic because I think

1110
01:08:51,327 --> 01:08:53,119
She's too smart enough to recognize like

1111
01:08:53,375 --> 01:08:53,887
What are we

1112
01:08:54,143 --> 01:08:55,679
What are we what are we talkin

1113
01:09:10,527 --> 01:09:11,039
Alright bye

1114
01:09:14,111 --> 01:09:14,879
Aggron

1115
01:09:53,535 --> 01:09:54,303
Civil rights

1116
01:10:15,039 --> 01:10:15,551
University

1117
01:10:40,639 --> 01:10:41,407
Used it for

1118
01:10:46,783 --> 01:10:50,367
Civil rights being violated

1119
01:10:57,791 --> 01:10:58,559
America

1120
01:11:02,655 --> 01:11:05,727
101

1121
01:11:21,087 --> 01:11:25,951
So where you see her such a great example of how Alex can answer any questions or dig deeper into

1122
01:11:26,207 --> 01:11:27,231
Any of these narratives

1123
01:11:27,487 --> 01:11:27,999
Talking point

1124
01:11:28,511 --> 01:11:31,071
Even at this point in his career even in 2003

1125
01:11:31,583 --> 01:11:37,727
Example of someone who violated because of the Patriot Act and he's capable of coming up with a single

1126
01:11:37,983 --> 01:11:38,495
Example

1127
01:11:38,751 --> 01:11:44,383
Whether or not there are people who fit that description if Alex can come up with something the defense is playing he's lost the point

1128
01:11:44,639 --> 01:11:46,175
In terms of conversation and his

1129
01:11:46,431 --> 01:11:48,479
No reason to take seriously his claim

1130
01:11:48,991 --> 01:11:54,623
No one is ever really challenged him on this point before especially on the show so Alex's unprepared to do anything other than what

1131
01:11:54,879 --> 01:11:57,183
Always does on the show we just about all over the

1132
01:11:58,207 --> 01:12:01,535
The conversation of civil rights Wings to the use of torture against foreign combat

1133
01:12:01,791 --> 01:12:04,351
What's an realizes at the switches

1134
01:12:04,607 --> 01:12:07,935
He tries to get back on track and remind Alex if they're talking about USA

1135
01:12:08,191 --> 01:12:08,703
Citizens civil rights

1136
01:12:09,471 --> 01:12:13,823
I was trying to bring up various country citizens being designated as enemy combatants which again

1137
01:12:14,079 --> 01:12:17,663
Agree with it or not and is a perfectly sensible response do in there

1138
01:12:17,919 --> 01:12:19,711
Boat the enemy is a wartime cry

1139
01:12:20,479 --> 01:12:23,039
My point is not about which side here I agree

1140
01:12:23,295 --> 01:12:25,343
It's about who's actually making sense

1141
01:12:25,599 --> 01:12:26,623
So try to stick to the point

1142
01:12:26,879 --> 01:12:29,439
And that person is undoubtedly and Coulter unfortunate

1143
01:12:29,695 --> 01:12:31,231
Unfortunately unfortunate

1144
01:12:31,743 --> 01:12:37,887
If the use of torture against for a combatant is disgusting and should never be acceptable but it doesn't intersect with the Civil Rights concerns that

1145
01:12:38,143 --> 01:12:38,655
Alex is breaking up

1146
01:12:38,911 --> 01:12:40,959
So it's really irrelevant to the conversation

1147
01:12:41,471 --> 01:12:46,079
Countries being designated enemy combatants also doesn't really have anything to do with

1148
01:12:46,335 --> 01:12:46,847
Point but

1149
01:12:47,103 --> 01:12:48,895
The notion that US citizens are being taken to

1150
01:12:49,151 --> 01:12:50,943
Partiallyroyal

1151
01:12:51,711 --> 01:12:57,855
There's only one example that could possibly possibly have about this which is Yasir Humpty who at this point

1152
01:12:58,111 --> 01:13:00,927
Already been transferred to a US prison once it was known he was acidic

1153
01:13:01,695 --> 01:13:06,303
At this point the only other citizen who had been declared an enemy combatant was Jose Padilla

1154
01:13:06,559 --> 01:13:09,631
Who is sentenced or planning to manufacture a radiological bomb

1155
01:13:09,887 --> 01:13:12,191
And held at a military prison in South Carolina

1156
01:13:12,959 --> 01:13:19,103
Both of these instances are interesting and concerned to civil liberties organizations but neither of them

1157
01:13:19,359 --> 01:13:20,127
Possible by the Patriot Act

1158
01:13:20,895 --> 01:13:26,015
This really has much more to do with the authorization for use of military force which was signed

1159
01:13:26,271 --> 01:13:31,903
On September 18th 2001 which itself was highly reliant on a 1942 Supreme Court ruling

1160
01:13:32,415 --> 01:13:33,439
Ex parte quirin

1161
01:13:33,951 --> 01:13:36,511
Regarding the use of military tribunals

1162
01:13:36,767 --> 01:13:38,303
48 captured German saboteurs

1163
01:13:39,071 --> 01:13:43,167
Instead of dealing with some of these subtleties Alex just point the finger at the Patriot Act because

1164
01:13:43,423 --> 01:13:44,959
That's easy to hang your hat on

1165
01:13:45,727 --> 01:13:47,007
Shorthand

1166
01:13:47,263 --> 01:13:48,031
Hey big post Ricky

1167
01:13:48,287 --> 01:13:49,823
Give him some kind of a credibility in this

1168
01:13:50,335 --> 01:13:53,407
Left Right right-wing civil libertarian liberties

1169
01:13:54,431 --> 01:13:56,991
Strictly speaking though and is still right

1170
01:13:57,503 --> 01:14:01,599
And if you want to take issue with the designation of people as enemy combatants

1171
01:14:01,855 --> 01:14:03,135
That essentially requires

1172
01:14:03,391 --> 01:14:05,695
Fundamental opposition to the way that

1173
01:14:06,975 --> 01:14:07,487
Mozart Opera

1174
01:14:07,743 --> 01:14:09,279
Alex doesn't want to deal with it

1175
01:14:09,535 --> 01:14:12,607
Tattoo instead he jumps to another one of his preloaded talking points

1176
01:14:12,863 --> 01:14:13,375
About what it

1177
01:14:13,887 --> 01:14:14,399
Support.

1178
01:14:15,167 --> 01:14:16,191
It wasn't talking about

1179
01:14:16,447 --> 01:14:19,519
Supporting the troops are not that I was responding to

1180
01:14:19,775 --> 01:14:23,359
Because he has a pre-scripted rant about how he's the one who supports the troops

1181
01:14:23,615 --> 01:14:26,431
By throwing that out we can pretend I'm some kind of a moral High Ground

1182
01:14:27,199 --> 01:14:30,015
Resume incredibly pointless conversation they're having analysis

1183
01:14:30,271 --> 01:14:30,783
Is losing

1184
01:14:31,551 --> 01:14:32,063
Losing

1185
01:14:32,319 --> 01:14:35,647
Yeah the point where she said then you then do

1186
01:14:36,415 --> 01:14:42,559
Fundamentally disagree with how the US military works then the the answer you have sugar

1187
01:14:42,815 --> 01:14:48,959
Then you can continue a conversation if you say no I still want them to do everything and I support

1188
01:14:49,215 --> 01:14:53,311
The troops then you're then what thinset stop talking

1189
01:14:53,567 --> 01:14:56,127
Shifting of the conversation in order to

1190
01:14:56,639 --> 01:14:57,663
Score Point absolutely

1191
01:14:57,919 --> 01:15:00,223
Another caller

1192
01:15:00,479 --> 01:15:01,247
These callers

1193
01:15:02,271 --> 01:15:02,783
Fitness culture

1194
01:15:03,039 --> 01:15:03,551
Please

1195
01:15:04,063 --> 01:15:04,831
Kakaboka morality

1196
01:15:05,087 --> 01:15:06,111
A president that has

1197
01:15:06,623 --> 01:15:07,391
Bohemian Grove

1198
01:15:07,647 --> 01:15:08,415
Oh yeah

1199
01:15:16,863 --> 01:15:17,887
Men get dressed up in

1200
01:15:20,191 --> 01:15:20,959
Songs

1201
01:15:29,407 --> 01:15:31,711
Human sacrifices

1202
01:15:37,087 --> 01:15:38,367
George Bush

1203
01:15:38,623 --> 01:15:39,391
Functions with

1204
01:15:50,143 --> 01:15:53,471
Whatever goes on that the Grove the sources that Alex aside until backup

1205
01:15:53,727 --> 01:15:56,287
Who's playing the gay sex workers are carted into work

1206
01:15:56,543 --> 01:15:57,823
Work for the group member

1207
01:15:58,591 --> 01:16:04,735
There's no women around and articles Alex references do discuss

1208
01:16:04,991 --> 01:16:09,599
Including but not limited to Men playing women very lewdly and States perform its is

1209
01:16:09,855 --> 01:16:11,135
And the audience hooting and hollering

1210
01:16:11,903 --> 01:16:15,999
The stories that Alex's referencing do discussed prostitution but the story

1211
01:16:16,255 --> 01:16:17,279
Doesn't match what he say

1212
01:16:17,791 --> 01:16:22,143
Essentially there is a nearby City to the Bohemian Grove called mate Rio

1213
01:16:22,399 --> 01:16:26,495
And there's a bar there that was Notorious for being a place where Bohemian club members

1214
01:16:26,751 --> 01:16:27,775
Could slip away at night

1215
01:16:28,031 --> 01:16:29,055
Order sex

1216
01:16:30,079 --> 01:16:33,663
According to a 1975 book by G William demoff

1217
01:16:34,175 --> 01:16:36,735
This is what the group members referred to as a river jump

1218
01:16:37,247 --> 01:16:43,391
This Washington Times article that Alex is referring to is from 1989 and it doesn't actually have to do with Bohemian Grove at all

1219
01:16:43,903 --> 01:16:44,671
It has to do with the

1220
01:16:44,927 --> 01:16:48,511
The fear that the Soviet Union was using male sex workers to ensnare politician

1221
01:16:49,535 --> 01:16:50,047
Not great

1222
01:16:50,559 --> 01:16:56,703
Quote we have known for many many years that there is a department of the KGB whose job it is to pray on sexual.

1223
01:16:57,215 --> 01:16:59,519
Etc retired lieutenant general Daniel Graham

1224
01:16:59,775 --> 01:17:01,055
Former head of the defense intelligence

1225
01:17:01,311 --> 01:17:01,823
Agency

1226
01:17:02,335 --> 01:17:07,967
Because closeted homosexuals in government service can easily be turned through blackmail for Espionage purposes

1227
01:17:08,223 --> 01:17:09,247
General G

1228
01:17:09,503 --> 01:17:15,391
We have we have always an intelligence tried very hard not to be giving classified information to known homosexual

1229
01:17:15,647 --> 01:17:19,999
Play could have gone the other direction you know you could have just been like it's okay to be gay

1230
01:17:20,511 --> 01:17:21,023
That's interesting

1231
01:17:21,279 --> 01:17:26,399
Totally cool source that is

1232
01:17:26,911 --> 01:17:29,215
In 2004 which is after this episode

1233
01:17:29,471 --> 01:17:35,359
Prisonplanet reposted a New York Post article about how there was a forward a pornstar name

1234
01:17:35,615 --> 01:17:37,151
Who worked as a valet at The Grove

1235
01:17:37,407 --> 01:17:41,759
Which is meant to imply that I guess he was also a sex worker powerful that that

1236
01:17:42,271 --> 01:17:45,599
And definitely not substantiate by the reporting

1237
01:17:46,111 --> 01:17:48,415
The Grove spokesperson Sam singer said quote

1238
01:17:48,671 --> 01:17:50,207
The club doesn't care about his past

1239
01:17:51,231 --> 01:17:55,071
Totally possible video someone who worked in the service industry and also in pornos

1240
01:17:55,327 --> 01:18:00,191
It's not like sex work always pays everyone's bills people also something inside have a second Revenue stream

1241
01:18:00,447 --> 01:18:03,775
What I can find no evidence to the claim that Alex is making

1242
01:18:04,031 --> 01:18:06,847
Might be able to win $10,000 here to take Alex up on it

1243
01:18:07,103 --> 01:18:10,943
An interesting Lee if you do try to find claims of like

1244
01:18:11,199 --> 01:18:17,343
Gay prostitutes being taken into Bohemian Grove so many other sources just linked back to Alex

1245
01:18:17,599 --> 01:18:18,879
Of course

1246
01:18:19,135 --> 01:18:24,511
How to really tough to try and find like where is this coming from if not from an Infowars article

1247
01:18:25,279 --> 01:18:27,071
I do think

1248
01:18:27,327 --> 01:18:30,655
That it is enjoyable to see a

1249
01:18:30,911 --> 01:18:33,727
Theoretically conservative luminary

1250
01:18:33,983 --> 01:18:37,055
Being peppered with the questions of people who actually follow them

1251
01:18:37,311 --> 01:18:43,455
And what's gray and will become a problem for them. Bye

1252
01:18:43,711 --> 01:18:49,343
It's always great whenever you have somebody who's like a screeching talking head on TV actually confronted with what they

1253
01:18:49,599 --> 01:18:55,743
They created and meet your demise years from now these people

1254
01:18:56,255 --> 01:18:58,815
And Israel was like oh my God I can't believe I'm talking

1255
01:18:59,071 --> 01:18:59,839
Do you weird us

1256
01:19:04,447 --> 01:19:06,495
It's in the title of your new girl car

1257
01:19:07,519 --> 01:19:08,031
To divert attention

1258
01:19:09,567 --> 01:19:10,335
Prescott Bush

1259
01:19:10,591 --> 01:19:11,103
Criminal

1260
01:19:11,359 --> 01:19:11,871
Farming

1261
01:19:12,383 --> 01:19:13,919
During World War II

1262
01:19:14,175 --> 01:19:14,687
Divert attention

1263
01:19:15,199 --> 01:19:16,735
A batch

1264
01:19:16,991 --> 01:19:18,783
Service cleaners

1265
01:19:19,039 --> 01:19:20,575
Fingers Valley British Empire

1266
01:19:20,831 --> 01:19:24,927
Fascination Ronald Reagan Iran-Contra.

1267
01:19:26,207 --> 01:19:26,719
Leave

1268
01:19:27,487 --> 01:19:28,767
New York

1269
01:19:31,839 --> 01:19:32,607
Are you sure

1270
01:19:33,375 --> 01:19:34,655
I'm saying this is

1271
01:19:37,215 --> 01:19:37,983
I'm concentrating

1272
01:19:38,239 --> 01:19:39,007
Helicopter

1273
01:19:43,359 --> 01:19:44,383
Chronicle

1274
01:19:44,895 --> 01:19:46,431
Warner

1275
01:19:47,455 --> 01:19:53,599
So I kind of feel like a pretty well I would definitely listen to take

1276
01:19:53,855 --> 01:19:59,999
Altogether be so much fun as punishment for both of them as long as proceeds from the show went to a charity

1277
01:20:00,255 --> 01:20:01,023
They're both of them didn't

1278
01:20:01,279 --> 01:20:03,327
Support yes they can't have anything to do with the money

1279
01:20:03,583 --> 01:20:07,679
Prescott Bush was not criminally convicted like this colors and like Alex's thing

1280
01:20:08,191 --> 01:20:11,775
Use on the board of a couple of companies that did business with a man named Fritz place in

1281
01:20:12,031 --> 01:20:15,360
I wasn't industrialist in Germany has been a member of the Nazi party

1282
01:20:16,128 --> 01:20:17,920
Business with license

1283
01:20:18,176 --> 01:20:23,040
Totally not illegal until the end of 1941 when the US entered World War 2

1284
01:20:23,296 --> 01:20:24,576
Since we were technically neuter

1285
01:20:25,856 --> 01:20:28,416
In 1942 the assets of these companies overseas

1286
01:20:28,672 --> 01:20:31,744
They seem to have had a falling-out with Hitler

1287
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:33,792
Was no longer support of the Nazi party

1288
01:20:34,304 --> 01:20:34,816
In fact

1289
01:20:35,072 --> 01:20:40,192
Tyson had supported the rise of Hitler and the Nazis financially and material

1290
01:20:40,448 --> 01:20:41,216
Had a strong break

1291
01:20:41,728 --> 01:20:44,288
In 1939 when Germany decided to invade Poland

1292
01:20:44,544 --> 01:20:45,056
Oh

1293
01:20:45,312 --> 01:20:51,456
I thought it was like Hitler slept with his girlfriend letters were published in life

1294
01:20:52,480 --> 01:20:53,504
Show me article quote

1295
01:20:53,760 --> 01:20:59,904
In publishing the paper is leading to my break with Adolf Hitler I wish to show that the German nation which elected Hitler it's

1296
01:21:00,160 --> 01:21:02,208
Leader because of his professed opposition

1297
01:21:02,464 --> 01:21:02,976
Communism

1298
01:21:03,232 --> 01:21:07,072
Is innocent in the developments that turn national socialism into its opposite

1299
01:21:07,840 --> 01:21:09,632
It is letters you pretty

1300
01:21:09,888 --> 01:21:12,448
Clearly opposed to the mistreatment of Jewish

1301
01:21:13,984 --> 01:21:20,128
When in on November 9th 1938 the Jews were robbed and tortured in the most cowardly and most brutal

1302
01:21:20,384 --> 01:21:22,944
Manor and their synagogues destroyed all over Germany

1303
01:21:23,200 --> 01:21:24,480
I protested once more

1304
01:21:24,992 --> 01:21:26,784
As an outward expression of my repugnance

1305
01:21:27,040 --> 01:21:29,344
I resigned my position of State counselor

1306
01:21:29,600 --> 01:21:30,368
All my protests

1307
01:21:30,624 --> 01:21:32,160
The pain no reply and no remedy

1308
01:21:33,184 --> 01:21:34,976
Essentially it's a pretty messy

1309
01:21:35,744 --> 01:21:39,328
Materially this guy and by extension the US folks like Prescott Bush who did

1310
01:21:39,584 --> 01:21:42,400
Businesses on the rise of the Nazi party

1311
01:21:42,912 --> 01:21:43,424
At the same

1312
01:21:43,680 --> 01:21:46,496
Time looking at their precise actions and what they did

1313
01:21:47,008 --> 01:21:50,080
Kind of different than if you were to look at someone like Henry Ford

1314
01:21:50,592 --> 01:21:51,104
You don't care

1315
01:21:51,360 --> 01:21:51,872
Sure

1316
01:21:52,128 --> 01:21:55,712
Sure all these people in a certain amount of historical blame but it's not

1317
01:21:55,968 --> 01:21:56,992
Always totally Tut

1318
01:21:57,248 --> 01:22:00,832
Dry or bush had great

1319
01:22:01,600 --> 01:22:05,696
They would have been happy to create an oppressive corporate state where labor rights were not existing

1320
01:22:06,208 --> 01:22:08,256
All of these characters sucking their own way

1321
01:22:08,512 --> 01:22:10,048
But Alex has to call Bush a Nazi

1322
01:22:10,304 --> 01:22:11,840
Speaker that's because he can't unpack

1323
01:22:12,096 --> 01:22:14,656
Things to recognize that the real

1324
01:22:14,912 --> 01:22:16,192
Jeffrey's involved with bison was

1325
01:22:16,704 --> 01:22:17,472
Their shared opposition

1326
01:22:17,728 --> 01:22:19,264
Communism which Alex agrees with

1327
01:22:19,776 --> 01:22:23,104
If you have to unpack this and talk about Jason's history witch

1328
01:22:23,360 --> 01:22:29,504
That only opens a political machine out of

1329
01:22:31,552 --> 01:22:33,088
And that's probably not something Alex on

1330
01:22:33,856 --> 01:22:36,416
To get into I am

1331
01:22:36,672 --> 01:22:37,184
Loving

1332
01:22:37,440 --> 01:22:38,208
Loving

1333
01:22:38,464 --> 01:22:38,976
The irony

1334
01:22:39,744 --> 01:22:42,816
The irony of a woman who is coming on this show

1335
01:22:43,072 --> 01:22:44,352
To sell me a book

1336
01:22:44,864 --> 01:22:45,632
About how great mall

1337
01:22:45,888 --> 01:22:52,032
Karthi was is now telling other people this is the nuttiest thing she's ever heard there is it is

1338
01:22:52,288 --> 01:22:56,640
Playlist nutty to call Prescott Bush and nothing but it is to say McCarthy was a good guy

1339
01:22:58,944 --> 01:23:02,016
I think though that one of the things you'll notice

1340
01:23:02,272 --> 01:23:04,064
If you listen to this whole thing is that

1341
01:23:04,576 --> 01:23:06,112
They ultimately just

1342
01:23:06,368 --> 01:23:07,136
They're both wrong

1343
01:23:08,416 --> 01:23:09,696
Pretty consistently

1344
01:23:10,208 --> 01:23:12,768
Is it least structurally making point

1345
01:23:13,024 --> 01:23:14,816
Right so she's right in that

1346
01:23:15,328 --> 01:23:18,912
Right but they're wrong about so much but they both think that they're right

1347
01:23:22,240 --> 01:23:24,288
Looking for black helicopter

1348
01:23:25,568 --> 01:23:26,336
Call home

1349
01:23:34,016 --> 01:23:34,528
Kane

1350
01:23:39,136 --> 01:23:40,416
You in promoter open border

1351
01:23:59,104 --> 01:23:59,616
Over here okay

1352
01:24:00,896 --> 01:24:05,504
I believe you are

1353
01:24:05,760 --> 01:24:10,880
They're both wrong Alex 2.0

1354
01:24:11,136 --> 01:24:13,184
Demonstrated that Aaron is somehow

1355
01:24:13,440 --> 01:24:18,560
Disconnected from reality because she's supporting these weapons of mass destruction

1356
01:24:18,816 --> 01:24:22,912
Your points are wrong

1357
01:24:23,168 --> 01:24:28,032
Two people arguing over how the KKK should committed genocide

1358
01:24:28,288 --> 01:24:33,408
Like what are you guys doing it is pretty strange

1359
01:24:33,664 --> 01:24:36,992
Go to break now it's come back and this is just pathetic

1360
01:24:37,760 --> 01:24:38,784
I don't know about you

1361
01:24:46,464 --> 01:24:47,488
So perfect that is

1362
01:24:47,744 --> 01:24:52,352
The Pink Panther theme because both of those

1363
01:24:52,864 --> 01:24:56,704
Clouseau with conspiracy

1364
01:24:59,520 --> 01:25:01,824
So Alex starts getting into like 911

1365
01:25:02,080 --> 01:25:03,360
Sure false Flags.

1366
01:25:03,616 --> 01:25:06,176
Comfortable territory exactly

1367
01:25:07,200 --> 01:25:08,224
Is a little kid

1368
01:25:16,928 --> 01:25:17,696
One investigation

1369
01:25:17,952 --> 01:25:18,464
Intimidating

1370
01:25:19,744 --> 01:25:20,256
Feisty

1371
01:25:24,864 --> 01:25:25,632
Easily intimidated

1372
01:25:26,912 --> 01:25:27,424
Call Jackie

1373
01:25:27,680 --> 01:25:28,448
Planes and flying

1374
01:25:38,688 --> 01:25:40,736
We trained Bahar jackalope

1375
01:26:07,616 --> 01:26:08,128
George Bush

1376
01:26:13,504 --> 01:26:15,040
Not as good

1377
01:26:25,024 --> 01:26:25,792
Your update

1378
01:26:33,472 --> 01:26:39,616
I came here to talk about how great and correct McCarthy was

1379
01:26:42,176 --> 01:26:48,320
Sdick I came here to sell the book full of nutty theories

1380
01:26:48,576 --> 01:26:52,928
Exactly what you say I came here to lie my way

1381
01:26:53,184 --> 01:26:54,208
But it still delightful

1382
01:26:54,464 --> 01:26:56,000
Are you do something about this

1383
01:26:56,256 --> 01:26:57,536
Part of it is because it's in the past

1384
01:26:58,048 --> 01:26:59,328
Pass

1385
01:26:59,584 --> 01:27:04,704
It can't hurt us more than it already has

1386
01:27:04,960 --> 01:27:07,008
Kind of fun to see her be annoyed

1387
01:27:07,264 --> 01:27:08,032
Also be

1388
01:27:08,288 --> 01:27:08,800
Be correct

1389
01:27:09,056 --> 01:27:12,896
And her annoying little at all so wrong about everything

1390
01:27:13,920 --> 01:27:14,688
There's just layers

1391
01:27:14,944 --> 01:27:16,992
It is it is nice

1392
01:27:17,248 --> 01:27:19,808
To see these two Dum Dums

1393
01:27:20,576 --> 01:27:25,440
Really just get to the heart of why they're incompatible and why the right-wing grift is

1394
01:27:25,696 --> 01:27:28,000
Destined to eat itself alive

1395
01:27:28,256 --> 01:27:29,280
You know is because

1396
01:27:29,792 --> 01:27:31,584
I'm selling my b*******

1397
01:27:32,096 --> 01:27:34,400
And I don't want to listen to your b*******

1398
01:27:34,656 --> 01:27:36,448
You know it's and it's like

1399
01:27:36,704 --> 01:27:42,080
Well yeah Alex is selling his bullshittin he doesn't want to listen to your b******* especially when your b******* is like

1400
01:27:42,592 --> 01:27:45,920
Fairly contradictory stupid

1401
01:27:46,432 --> 01:27:52,576
There's that so it's just a going back and forth with people and Ann Coulter gets to act like she's laughing

1402
01:27:52,832 --> 01:27:53,600
Get all of this s***

1403
01:27:53,856 --> 01:27:54,368
Because it's

1404
01:27:54,624 --> 01:27:56,672
Sounds more openly lunatic

1405
01:27:56,928 --> 01:28:03,072
Then what she selling you which is it adult same lunacy wrapped up in better word but she's got like

1406
01:28:04,096 --> 01:28:04,608
Great

1407
01:28:04,864 --> 01:28:07,936
Life of privilege to get to answer the phone call

1408
01:28:08,192 --> 01:28:13,056
She'll go and meet up with a friend have a cocktail and talk on the phone

1409
01:28:14,080 --> 01:28:17,408
One last call for an

1410
01:28:19,968 --> 01:28:22,272
Does not get a chance to answer and let Alex

1411
01:28:22,784 --> 01:28:23,552
Crater Lake

1412
01:28:23,808 --> 01:28:25,088
A real pilot garbage

1413
01:28:25,344 --> 01:28:27,136
Tambascio

1414
01:28:27,392 --> 01:28:28,928
I mean look it's rude

1415
01:28:29,184 --> 01:28:30,464
But also kind of funny

1416
01:28:41,728 --> 01:28:43,008
I just want to do

1417
01:28:43,520 --> 01:28:44,544
Faded

1418
01:28:46,336 --> 01:28:47,360
Things to get reelected

1419
01:28:50,432 --> 01:28:50,944
Azar

1420
01:28:51,712 --> 01:28:52,224
He should be

1421
01:28:55,296 --> 01:28:55,808
Being elected

1422
01:28:58,112 --> 01:28:59,136
There's more important things

1423
01:28:59,648 --> 01:29:00,416
I like Preserve

1424
01:29:00,672 --> 01:29:01,440
Constitution

1425
01:29:02,464 --> 01:29:02,976
Right now

1426
01:29:04,512 --> 01:29:05,280
More than

1427
01:29:08,352 --> 01:29:08,864
I'm quotes

1428
01:29:51,616 --> 01:29:54,944
Doesn't matter anymore

1429
01:29:59,040 --> 01:29:59,808
Pretty pretty good

1430
01:30:00,064 --> 01:30:02,368
That's good stuff

1431
01:30:02,624 --> 01:30:03,904
That's good stuff

1432
01:30:04,416 --> 01:30:06,208
I mean there's three things that are amazing

1433
01:30:06,464 --> 01:30:07,488
First is the

1434
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:08,512
Sweet

1435
01:30:08,768 --> 01:30:10,560
You can't answer the question

1436
01:30:10,816 --> 01:30:11,840
That's supposed to be the last question for a

1437
01:30:12,608 --> 01:30:18,752
2nd and jumping and receipt like I wish your candidate Lyndon larouche the best of luck in the next alarm

1438
01:30:26,432 --> 01:30:27,456
Drivel

1439
01:30:27,968 --> 01:30:31,808
This lady lying to you about McCarthy I think

1440
01:30:32,064 --> 01:30:32,576
The Alex

1441
01:30:32,832 --> 01:30:37,440
Wanted that like don't buy her book to be way more earned that was

1442
01:30:37,696 --> 01:30:43,328
That was really a really really jealous

1443
01:30:43,584 --> 01:30:44,608
Like it if

1444
01:30:45,120 --> 01:30:45,888
It's

1445
01:30:47,424 --> 01:30:51,008
It's pretty funny though hey I appreciate

1446
01:30:51,520 --> 01:30:53,056
I'm sorry

1447
01:30:53,312 --> 01:30:54,080
I think that

1448
01:30:54,336 --> 01:30:54,848
Like

1449
01:30:55,616 --> 01:30:56,128
This is a gif

1450
01:30:56,384 --> 01:30:56,896
For Alex

1451
01:30:57,408 --> 01:31:00,480
Hotels in 30 is a big deal

1452
01:31:00,736 --> 01:31:01,248
Huge

1453
01:31:01,504 --> 01:31:02,784
I think he handled this

1454
01:31:03,296 --> 01:31:03,808
Poorly

1455
01:31:04,320 --> 01:31:07,136
I think they called it doesn't give a s*** about who he is

1456
01:31:07,392 --> 01:31:08,416
Might not matter

1457
01:31:08,928 --> 01:31:12,000
But this kind of behavior would definitely be like

1458
01:31:12,512 --> 01:31:13,536
If she cared

1459
01:31:13,792 --> 01:31:15,328
She has access to all sorts of

1460
01:31:15,840 --> 01:31:17,120
Very famous people

1461
01:31:17,376 --> 01:31:20,448
That could be Gaston altucher and now will not

1462
01:31:20,704 --> 01:31:21,728
Hello

1463
01:31:21,984 --> 01:31:24,800
Promises the interview was supposed to be the promoter book

1464
01:31:25,056 --> 01:31:26,336
And instead you just

1465
01:31:26,592 --> 01:31:31,712
Set about to dump shift or annoyed her

1466
01:31:31,968 --> 01:31:32,736
Yeah

1467
01:31:32,992 --> 01:31:36,320
It's kind of. How you treat against I love

1468
01:31:36,576 --> 01:31:38,112
Both of them feeling bad

1469
01:31:38,624 --> 01:31:39,648
About this

1470
01:31:39,904 --> 01:31:40,928
I think she

1471
01:31:41,184 --> 01:31:45,792
I don't think she did I think of the end she's got a good good snippy

1472
01:31:46,048 --> 01:31:52,192
Line and I probably could line into that she's going to get a highball and have a great time have a nice day

1473
01:31:52,448 --> 01:31:54,496
Tell me I think she walked away from this thinking

1474
01:31:54,752 --> 01:31:56,288
I don't like what happened

1475
01:31:56,544 --> 01:32:00,896
I like are feeling like that

1476
01:32:01,152 --> 01:32:07,296
But I don't know if it matters matters to her

1477
01:32:07,552 --> 01:32:09,856
Probably from this much more pissed off than

1478
01:32:11,136 --> 01:32:14,208
I think he was actually mad

1479
01:32:14,464 --> 01:32:17,280
She will be happy and playing around with

1480
01:32:20,096 --> 01:32:23,936
The laughing at being like this black helicopter s***

1481
01:32:24,192 --> 01:32:28,800
This is larouche announcer for sure there was actually an amusement on her part like

1482
01:32:29,056 --> 01:32:35,200
I have accidentally stumbled universe

1483
01:32:35,456 --> 01:32:40,320
Calling and asking me about prostitutes the Bohemian Grove

1484
01:32:40,832 --> 01:32:44,160
Amazing people who will just agree to go on a show

1485
01:32:44,928 --> 01:32:46,976
Now just with no knowledge

1486
01:32:47,232 --> 01:32:48,768
Don't know who that person is

1487
01:32:49,024 --> 01:32:49,792
Yeah

1488
01:32:50,048 --> 01:32:52,096
It is it is strange

1489
01:32:52,352 --> 01:32:53,120
This is

1490
01:32:53,376 --> 01:32:57,984
Maybe one of the last high-profile interviews to get for a while

1491
01:32:58,240 --> 01:32:59,264
Because it does it does not

1492
01:32:59,776 --> 01:33:00,800
It's not a good

1493
01:33:01,056 --> 01:33:02,336
Marketing tool for like

1494
01:33:02,592 --> 01:33:07,968
Hey come talk to me right I will treat you well I know it's three or four they didn't

1495
01:33:08,224 --> 01:33:09,248
They didn't have group text

1496
01:33:09,504 --> 01:33:15,648
But I'm sure she could still get on the phone pretty quick with a lot of people so at least in a day

1497
01:33:16,416 --> 01:33:18,464
There's hundreds of people who are going on

1498
01:33:18,720 --> 01:33:20,256
Alex

1499
01:33:20,768 --> 01:33:22,048
Like I said I think it's probably just

1500
01:33:22,304 --> 01:33:26,912
Got done with it and maybe want to tell the friend cuz it's funny

1501
01:33:27,936 --> 01:33:29,728
I can't imagine that she thinks he's relevant

1502
01:33:29,984 --> 01:33:36,128
No that's true like if you have this kind of interaction with somebody first of all you know that they

1503
01:33:36,384 --> 01:33:37,408
Are behaving is

1504
01:33:37,664 --> 01:33:38,432
A gracious host

1505
01:33:38,944 --> 01:33:41,760
She'll probably like this is an unprofessional a******

1506
01:33:42,272 --> 01:33:44,320
Doing a radio show

1507
01:33:44,576 --> 01:33:49,184
Successful possible ideas that are being expressed in new like this is

1508
01:33:49,440 --> 01:33:50,464
This is fringe nonce

1509
01:33:51,744 --> 01:33:53,792
Maybe I got to talk to my

1510
01:33:56,352 --> 01:34:02,496
Yeah Boy anyway I enjoyed this a lot I was really looking forward to this episode

1511
01:34:03,008 --> 01:34:04,288
Because of the like

1512
01:34:04,544 --> 01:34:05,312
Batiz I got a

1513
01:34:05,568 --> 01:34:11,712
Big slimy

1514
01:34:11,968 --> 01:34:12,736
Off the rail fun

1515
01:34:13,248 --> 01:34:13,760
That's great

1516
01:34:14,016 --> 01:34:14,528
That's just great

1517
01:34:15,040 --> 01:34:16,832
Good clean fun

1518
01:34:17,088 --> 01:34:18,880
And it's for 2003 that's the best

1519
01:34:19,392 --> 01:34:20,160
So we'll be back

1520
01:34:20,416 --> 01:34:21,440
But until then

1521
01:34:21,696 --> 01:34:27,840
Website.com

1522
01:34:28,096 --> 01:34:31,168
