7
00:01:16,544 --> 00:01:19,616
No it's not

8
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:38,816

00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:45,216
If not giving an update on plants in a while

10
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:48,288

Begun to flower

15

Exciting things

16
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:07,232
I can't say enough

17
00:02:07,488 --> 00:02:08,256
Wild it was

18
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:10,048
Come in here and look and see like

19
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:16,448
There's a yellow burst of flowers

00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:21,824
The fruits

21
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:30,016
And here we are in the middle of apartment in Chicago just got a little yellow flower girl

22
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:37,696
Yeah 42 dude you're probably never going to have children

23
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:49,984
Wild I spent a long time the other night

24
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:53,568
Watching videos about the Cucumber

25
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:58,688

27
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:04,832
I got the Cucumbers out of that makes

28
00:03:05,856 --> 00:03:10,208
Great everything's going to be fantastic

29
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:16,864
Utter failure that we've not fully talk about

30
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:29,664
Flowers

31
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:36,064

34
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:58,592
Memorial was yesterday

35
00:04:00,128 --> 00:04:01,664
Woke up

36
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:02,432
And

37
00:04:02,944 --> 00:04:06,272
Had like a really terrible feeling in my gut

38
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:08,320
The memorial

39
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:10,624
I couldn't remember what time the memorial

40
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:15,744
Transpose the numbers with a different

41
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,887
Appointment that I had it was I thought was not at 3 a.m. it's 11

42
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:28,287
So

43
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:34,943
It was later than it actually is

44
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:40,831
It was later than I thought it was

45
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:42,367
Maybe I will crawl

46
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:48,767
Maybe I heard you wrong

47
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:57,215
Are you recording this for

48
00:04:57,471 --> 00:05:03,615
Reason

49
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:05,151
Live well we're going to talk about

50
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:11,551
A half hour late my dad managed to get them

51
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:13,855
Push it back so I could be there for the whole thing

52
00:05:14,111 --> 00:05:17,439
Ahold

53
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:21,535
Not a chance so

54
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:22,815
It's a bracelet

55
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:24,607
It's Memorial

56
00:05:24,863 --> 00:05:25,375
Sure

57
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:33,567
I mean like

58
00:05:34,079 --> 00:05:35,103
American Memorial

59
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:38,431
But you being late

60
00:05:39,711 --> 00:05:43,295
The audience when I say our hearts

61
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:47,903
In this trying time that you've been through the last couple weeks

62
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:55,839
You are able to take a nap

63
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:17,087
Ridiculous

64
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:28,607
You know erase their donations

65
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:31,679
But I can't

66
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:36,031
But I consider this group of microcosm

67
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:37,823
That allowed me to

68
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:40,895
Power through today

69
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:41,663
Where

70
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:44,479
Under other circumstances I might have

71
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:51,135
Thrown my headphones across the room and said

72
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:55,487
This is a Spirit Bomb situation

73
00:06:55,743 --> 00:07:01,887
Came to you is as power that is what I would like to express

74
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:03,935

Unfortunately

84

She is awesome

85
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:56,927

00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:31,231
Generosity

92
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:40,959

94
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:55,807

And there was not a note

96
00:08:58,623 --> 00:09:00,671
And I found out once again

97
00:09:00,927 --> 00:09:06,559
A lot of people is not taking credit falsely for gift

98
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:09,887
Beck's

99
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:11,679

Later on to actually there is no right

Situation Barry I believe it

129
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:40,671
Yeah complex

130
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:43,231
The balance is pretty nice though

131
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:44,511
Burien

132
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:49,887
Much more challenging Mommy

133
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:52,959

135
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:58,847

00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:09,855
Carolina Reaper

139
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:12,415
Garlic is mod

140
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:18,815
Across-the-board

141
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:21,887
Know about that

142
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:25,727
The episode

143
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:29,055
How are you doing

144
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:36,735
Big news over this weekend

145
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:40,831
In Ohio

146
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:41,855
That was policeman

147
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:44,415
Husband

148
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:50,815
Diesel truck video for rest started making the rounds on Friday and immediately started to have some

149
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:51,583
Responses

150
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:54,911
Is the bat signal

151
00:12:55,167 --> 00:13:01,311
Well okay I better get a solid

152
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:03,103
Going on what's going on

153
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:08,991
God it's the worst he was arrested by Commissioner Gordon

154
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:21,279
It's f****** Millie Weaver and it's

155
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:24,351
Nonsensical

156
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:25,119
Anyway

157
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:26,911
One thing

158
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:27,935
Nooworks

159
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:31,007
So it's best not to take anything at face value

160
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:33,567
A lot of skepticism

161
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:36,127
There is a

162
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:38,431
Required for claims are being made by people like her

163
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:41,503
Steidl

164
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:52,255
There's only a suspicious

165
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:57,119
Additionally

166
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:14,271
Possible

167
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:20,415
It's tactically a weird thing to see if you was mine

168
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:27,583
A couple of important things to give him mine though are they million her husband are white and this is Diamond Ohio

169
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:30,143
Community in northeastern Ohio

170
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:32,959
Population

171
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:39,871
Responsibility

172
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:44,223
Angela Mia's

173
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:46,527
It seems like a lot of it seems weird

174
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:50,623
Probably not proof of anything or fake

175
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:55,231
Plus the rest itself

176
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:55,999
Pretty boring

177
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:59,583
The amp up the drama

178
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:01,631
Maybe get her tackle

179
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:09,823
Confirmation

180
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:16,223
She actually was arrested Sunday and

181
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:17,759
Go before a judge on Monday

182
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:22,879
The?

183
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:28,255
On the day of her arrest August 14th

184
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:31,071
Through an associate's YouTube channel she released

185
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:33,631
Expose

186
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:36,703
Billy purports this to be the most dangerous

187
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:40,031
Biggest whistleblowing event

188
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:42,847
Check that you would get arrested and then they would release the documentary

189
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:44,639
It's so perfect

190
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:49,247
Money could never buy

191
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:51,807
It gives the film appearance of authenticity

192
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:53,087
Create the Whirlwind

193
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:54,111
The Buzz

194
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:58,719
Looking at this rationally a couple of General possibilities

195
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:03,327
The first is that the globalists there whoever had Millie arrested because

196
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:05,631
They were worried about the documentary that she was making

197
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:12,543
This seems dumb from their standpoint because she's been talking about this documentary for awhile and any Global is worth their salt would know that a red

198
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:14,591
Trusting person makes an expose

199
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:19,967
I only ask

200
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:22,271
Explanation

201
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:25,599
Unless

202
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:30,719
Yeah considering that we do have a recent example of

203
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:32,255
In Edwards

204
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:38,655
You wanted to do Millie like they do Edward Snowden for releasing all this information

205
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:40,447
We would be in a very different

206
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:41,983
Certainly

207
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:50,175
I believe the Infowars is actually number of whistleblower types

208
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:53,503
I don't know

209
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:57,087
The second possibility is that Millie was arrested because of the documentary

210
00:16:57,343 --> 00:17:00,415
Because something she did in the course of the creation of it

211
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:05,535
Could be an issue like she stole documents or something and that could be

212
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:09,887
When more information is available we can reassess this as possibility

213
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:16,543
The third possibility is this arrest has nothing to do with the documentary

214
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:23,199
I have no reason to believe that is the case but

215
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:23,967
I feel that way

216
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:30,111
Completed prior to the arrest

217
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:31,647
It was waiting to be released

218
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:32,927
What could have been done at any time

219
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:36,511
Millie does not seem all that surprised in the arrest

220
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:38,047
When the officer is there

221
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:44,447
Do you not happy about the situation video does not match

222
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:46,239
She's rainbow snatch

223
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:49,311
She's the reporter who go confront a face-to-face

224
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:50,335
It doesn't seem like

225
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:53,663
Passively accept

226
00:17:57,759 --> 00:17:59,807
If anything in her documentary is to believe

227
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:03,391
Then she has to know the second she gets in that car

228
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:07,231
She's going to prison for a long time cuz we're just set up

229
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:10,303
We'll get two wires you would have to know that towards the end of this

230
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:15,679
Overalls Infowars reporter wood

231
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:19,007
Respond to an unexpected arrest about their reporting

232
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:20,543
Find

233
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:21,823
Like

234
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:27,199
If it were if it kind of seems like going through the motions

235
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:29,759
As as an imp

236
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:35,391
As a reporter I think what I would go for is a kind of

237
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:37,439
Resign Mannino

238
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:38,975
Officer

239
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:40,767
Can you put out both your piss

240
00:18:41,023 --> 00:18:45,375
Right next to each other

241
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:48,703
I think I would go is like passive non-compliance

242
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:54,335
Sing like that

243
00:18:59,455 --> 00:19:00,735
Show me inside

244
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:05,087
Boomer shirt

245
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:06,623
While she's getting arrested

246
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:11,743
As a whole

247
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:13,023
Or even large

248
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:21,471
She knew that there was a warrant out for her arrest

249
00:19:27,359 --> 00:19:28,383
I'm just saying

250
00:19:28,895 --> 00:19:30,175
It's weird the documentary was

251
00:19:30,431 --> 00:19:31,711
Completely ready to go

252
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:35,039
It got posted online almost immediately afterwards

253
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:36,575
Surprise

254
00:19:37,087 --> 00:19:39,647
There's someone else there to take care of her kids

255
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:42,719
I don't know it's just like

256
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:45,791
Like everything just happened organically

257
00:19:53,215 --> 00:19:53,983
Release the documentary

258
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:04,735
Verbs with representatives from the Portage County Jail

259
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:08,575
Charges of robbery

260
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:10,879
Obstructing justice and domestic violence

261
00:20:11,903 --> 00:20:17,023
They were arrested for and the fact that in order for a warrant to be issued

262
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:18,559
Approved by a grand jury

263
00:20:18,815 --> 00:20:21,119
Really strong suspicion that this arrest

264
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:23,679
Entirely different from the documentary

265
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:25,983
Nothing to do with that I don't believe

266
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:33,151
The domestic violence charge in there's particular

267
00:20:33,407 --> 00:20:33,919
The documentary

268
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:37,503
We need more information on this informed decision

269
00:20:40,575 --> 00:20:41,855
Yours are f****** Infowars

270
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:46,207
She doesn't get the benefit of the doubt that she's an Intrepid reporter getting arrested for standing up to

271
00:20:46,463 --> 00:20:47,999
The man I'm going to go to the big no on that one

272
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:50,303
Basically my feeling on this is balos

273
00:20:51,071 --> 00:20:56,703
It looks like the arrest itself was real but

274
00:20:57,215 --> 00:21:03,103
However it is super super clear that there is an attempt to use the arrest as a promotional tool

275
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:04,639
This documentary

276
00:21:05,151 --> 00:21:06,431
The messaging is very

277
00:21:06,943 --> 00:21:07,967
The rest was retribution

278
00:21:08,223 --> 00:21:11,295
For making this expose

279
00:21:11,807 --> 00:21:14,111
Is this documentary actually dangerous at all

280
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:21,024
Anybody arrest someone for me

281
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:27,424
The documentary art

282
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:34,080
That can't be a standard it only applies to Alex himself

283
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:38,688
Obviously this interesting

284
00:21:38,944 --> 00:21:40,224
Galaxy

285
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,760
Talk about it as though

286
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:43,040
He wore himself arrest

287
00:21:44,064 --> 00:21:47,392
Exactly I decided to watch this for myself

288
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:50,720
To see what was out there and it was easy enough to find on YouTube

289
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:51,488
Very easy

290
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:56,352
Another serious problem

291
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:58,912
Exactly wow

292
00:21:59,424 --> 00:22:00,704
Another account

293
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,800
Your response does highlight another problem

294
00:22:05,312 --> 00:22:11,456
In the past few months

295
00:22:11,712 --> 00:22:12,480
From YouTube

296
00:22:12,992 --> 00:22:16,320
All the doctors were telling truth about covid-19

297
00:22:16,576 --> 00:22:20,160
People like David Icke

298
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:24,768
Alex has invested a lot of his energy into promoting the idea that censorship

299
00:22:25,024 --> 00:22:27,328
Control process

300
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:29,632
Actually accidentally made the inverse argument

301
00:22:30,144 --> 00:22:35,008
If it's the truth

302
00:22:35,264 --> 00:22:41,408
U of L audit Bertinelli said to anything that doesn't get removed is apparently not true

303
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:44,480
This is a problem because Millie's video still up on YouTube

304
00:22:44,736 --> 00:22:49,344
As of the channel to posted it which is run by one of the two main sources

305
00:22:50,112 --> 00:22:56,256
Globalist went over to arrest Melly documentary

306
00:22:56,512 --> 00:23:02,656
By arresting her and then doing literally

307
00:23:02,912 --> 00:23:06,496
Play nothing to silence stop for being reported

308
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:09,056
It does seem a little odd

309
00:23:09,312 --> 00:23:12,896
Problem

310
00:23:13,408 --> 00:23:15,968
Sometimes you don't get the negative response you're hoping

311
00:23:16,224 --> 00:23:22,368
Kind of looks like an invitation

312
00:23:22,624 --> 00:23:23,904
Ezekiel's Bi-Rite

313
00:23:24,672 --> 00:23:29,536
So I watch the stupid documentary

314
00:23:30,304 --> 00:23:32,864
Stupid

315
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:36,704
I was not worried about that

316
00:23:42,592 --> 00:23:48,224
Every single salacious thing that's in the film is just

317
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:54,624
Accepted as solid proof is one of those guys guy with telescope from Kerry Cassidy telescope

318
00:23:55,136 --> 00:24:01,280
Motorcycle for Trump

319
00:24:03,328 --> 00:24:05,888
Work when you start to ask yourself

320
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:08,704
Who are these people

321
00:24:09,216 --> 00:24:09,984
Mount Jordan

322
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,008
I'm sorry about this

323
00:24:11,264 --> 00:24:14,848
But we're about to go over Millie Weaver's new documentary shadowgate

324
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:23,040
Information such as

325
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:25,600
Impressively stupid documentaries

326
00:24:26,624 --> 00:24:30,720
Sucks it really bad like I said without the spiritual energy

327
00:24:30,976 --> 00:24:32,768
2 mi from our wonderful supporters

328
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:37,376
I hate

329
00:24:37,632 --> 00:24:38,656
Every penny

330
00:24:39,168 --> 00:24:42,496
A upper window

331
00:24:49,408 --> 00:24:50,688
A week you're going to jump off your balcony

332
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,016
I think I went through

333
00:24:56,576 --> 00:25:02,720
Sure

334
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:13,472
Dark Times

335
00:25:17,312 --> 00:25:19,360
You listen to like 30 seconds of

336
00:25:22,432 --> 00:25:25,760
There's so many things to look into it none of this is real

337
00:25:29,088 --> 00:25:31,392
You get burnt out

338
00:25:31,904 --> 00:25:38,048
I know you're lying I don't care yeah yeah I was going to say

339
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:41,888
You don't

340
00:25:42,144 --> 00:25:44,448
Need to prove that she's full of s***

341
00:25:44,704 --> 00:25:47,264
But in order for this to work you have to prove

342
00:25:59,296 --> 00:26:03,136
It could have been just about everything

343
00:26:03,392 --> 00:26:04,416
I could have said prove it

344
00:26:04,672 --> 00:26:09,792
Very annoying

345
00:26:12,096 --> 00:26:13,120
We have to do a show to

346
00:26:17,984 --> 00:26:23,872
Play out the room and then

347
00:26:27,456 --> 00:26:27,968
Oh no

348
00:26:28,224 --> 00:26:31,040
Start off where Millie Weaver

349
00:26:31,552 --> 00:26:33,856
I'm sorry

350
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:36,928
Please

351
00:26:37,184 --> 00:26:42,560
Turn up the screen about everything

352
00:26:43,584 --> 00:26:44,864
Beginning

353
00:26:45,632 --> 00:26:46,400
What if I were to

354
00:26:46,656 --> 00:26:47,168
Tell you

355
00:26:47,424 --> 00:26:48,192
Small group

356
00:26:48,704 --> 00:26:49,472
Government

357
00:26:50,496 --> 00:26:51,264
Higher

358
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:52,288
Like government

359
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:53,056
Beneficial

360
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:54,080
To frame

361
00:26:54,848 --> 00:26:55,360
Campaign

362
00:26:55,616 --> 00:26:56,128
Shut up

363
00:26:56,384 --> 00:26:56,896
Come up

364
00:26:57,152 --> 00:26:57,664
For the Russia

365
00:26:58,688 --> 00:26:59,456
Investigation

366
00:27:00,224 --> 00:27:00,736
Provided

367
00:27:03,296 --> 00:27:03,808
And

368
00:27:04,064 --> 00:27:04,576
Provided

369
00:27:05,856 --> 00:27:06,368
Services

370
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:07,648
To the Department

371
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:08,672
Justice

372
00:27:09,184 --> 00:27:09,952
During the mule

373
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:12,768
What is it

374
00:27:13,024 --> 00:27:13,792
Just so happen

375
00:27:16,608 --> 00:27:17,120
Arby's

376
00:27:17,632 --> 00:27:18,144
The steak new

377
00:27:20,704 --> 00:27:21,216
Operate

Missions on social

379

And

380
00:27:34,016 --> 00:27:38,880
So in this introduction

381
00:27:39,136 --> 00:27:39,904
Either that

382
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:46,304
Or she's actually just curious

383
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:48,352
Something along the lines of like

384
00:27:53,216 --> 00:27:53,984
You got to go

385
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:59,872
Have you considered

386
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:06,272
Because they're the rubric by which we are forced to judge it because what she said

387
00:28:06,784 --> 00:28:07,296
1

388
00:28:07,552 --> 00:28:12,160
A small group of government contractors were hired by the government to frame the Trump campaign

389
00:28:12,416 --> 00:28:16,512
The Russian investigation was a setup carried out by the same contractor

390
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:24,448
4

391
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:32,896
Calls on Hillary's behalf

392
00:28:33,152 --> 00:28:37,760
These contractors are

393
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:43,392
Social media

394
00:28:43,648 --> 00:28:49,792
Influencer campaign same contractor

395
00:28:50,048 --> 00:28:51,328
History of the United States

396
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:03,872
This is a whole lot for an hour and 20 minutes

397
00:29:04,384 --> 00:29:10,272
Rainbow snakes the best because I'm from the future I already know that she doesn't prove

398
00:29:10,528 --> 00:29:12,320
That's unfortunate

399
00:29:12,576 --> 00:29:18,720
I think a lot of stuff she said two could fall under the normal category of invest

400
00:29:18,976 --> 00:29:20,512
Navigation

401
00:29:20,768 --> 00:29:22,048
Do they hired

402
00:29:23,072 --> 00:29:29,216
To investigate him or to set you are as we're going to learn here maybe there are

403
00:29:30,496 --> 00:29:32,800
Infrastructure company is

404
00:29:33,312 --> 00:29:35,360
That have some overlap

405
00:29:35,872 --> 00:29:37,152
Downtown

406
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:40,224
So anyway

407
00:29:40,992 --> 00:29:45,600
Billy Gibson

408
00:29:47,904 --> 00:29:50,720
That's just going to happen forever

409
00:29:51,232 --> 00:29:57,376
I wish we could

410
00:29:57,632 --> 00:29:58,144
Open gate

411
00:29:58,656 --> 00:29:59,168
You need

412
00:29:59,424 --> 00:30:00,192
To take a question

413
00:30:00,704 --> 00:30:01,216
Or something

414
00:30:01,728 --> 00:30:02,240
A class

415
00:30:02,752 --> 00:30:04,032
About getting rid of gate

416
00:30:05,824 --> 00:30:07,360
We'll call ourselves

417
00:30:07,616 --> 00:30:13,760
Bill Gates Gates Foundation

418
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:21,184

Bad news

00:30:29,376 --> 00:30:30,144
Covering up

422
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:30,912
What should

423
00:30:31,424 --> 00:30:32,192
Turn out to be

424
00:30:34,752 --> 00:30:35,264
Shadowgate

425
00:30:36,288 --> 00:30:38,080

Tearing out

430

Full of all

436
00:31:00,096 --> 00:31:00,864
This is about

438
00:31:05,984 --> 00:31:06,752
Career

439
00:31:08,288 --> 00:31:08,800
Part of the

440
00:31:09,056 --> 00:31:09,824
The Beltway

441
00:31:10,336 --> 00:31:11,104
Even app

442
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,664
But they are not

443
00:31:17,504 --> 00:31:18,016
A government

444
00:31:18,272 --> 00:31:18,784
Contract

445
00:31:19,552 --> 00:31:20,064
Descent

446
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:20,832
Intelligence

447
00:31:21,344 --> 00:31:21,856
Security +

448
00:31:22,112 --> 00:31:22,624
And so on

449
00:31:23,136 --> 00:31:23,648
Our

450
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:24,672
Mostly

451
00:31:24,928 --> 00:31:25,440
Sis

452
00:31:25,696 --> 00:31:26,208
Front face

453

Center compartment

454
00:31:29,024 --> 00:31:29,536
Metalized

455
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:32,096
Grateful to work LOL

456
00:31:32,352 --> 00:31:32,864
Or the fact that

457
00:31:34,656 --> 00:31:35,168
Is outsourced

458
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:36,192
Contractors

459
00:31:36,704 --> 00:31:37,728
AKA

460
00:31:37,984 --> 00:31:38,496
The military

461
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:41,312
That way

462
00:31:41,824 --> 00:31:42,336
Publix

463
00:31:43,104 --> 00:31:43,872
Request

464
00:31:44,384 --> 00:31:44,896
Investigation

465
00:31:47,968 --> 00:31:48,480
Is as

466
00:31:49,248 --> 00:31:49,760
As a

467
00:31:55,136 --> 00:31:55,648
Why does

468
00:31:56,928 --> 00:31:59,488
This is such a bunch of nonsense

469
00:31:59,744 --> 00:32:01,792
You put it on for you regardless

470
00:32:03,328 --> 00:32:05,376
Right off the bat

471
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:11,776
This is such b*******

472
00:32:12,032 --> 00:32:13,312
About to say

473
00:32:13,824 --> 00:32:17,664
It's impossible to prove that any of this ever happens or did happen because

474
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:21,248
Contractors

475
00:32:22,016 --> 00:32:23,808
This is critical for Melly because

476
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:24,832
It's dumb

477
00:32:25,088 --> 00:32:29,696
But it sounds just sensible enough for anyone except

478
00:32:29,952 --> 00:32:32,768
Quiet

479
00:32:33,024 --> 00:32:34,048
What's 3

480
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:35,584
Should be able to prove it

481
00:32:37,376 --> 00:32:38,912
Here's what I

482
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:43,520
You would put in a foia request any

483
00:32:43,776 --> 00:32:46,592
Oh I did search The Archives

484
00:32:46,848 --> 00:32:52,992
Never once has anyone named Millie weaver or Millicent Weaver

485
00:32:53,248 --> 00:32:56,576
Noah

486
00:32:56,832 --> 00:33:02,976
There are no requests on file with the organization

487
00:33:03,232 --> 00:33:07,328
Justification for not doing your job

488
00:33:07,584 --> 00:33:09,632
Even if I wanted to so why would I

489
00:33:09,888 --> 00:33:10,656
Right

490
00:33:10,912 --> 00:33:17,056
If you are too gullible idiot if you would take two minutes to look at the house

491
00:33:17,312 --> 00:33:18,080
Contractors are subject

492
00:33:18,336 --> 00:33:18,848
For your request

493
00:33:19,104 --> 00:33:19,616
Just like rain

494
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:21,408
Regular government employees

495
00:33:22,176 --> 00:33:28,320
Contractor sounds like a big scary thing but in reality

496
00:33:28,576 --> 00:33:30,368
Government entity on a contract basis

497
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:35,232
If you're a construction company and the government in the building erected for a contract

498
00:33:36,256 --> 00:33:38,304
Graduation

499
00:33:40,864 --> 00:33:42,400
Fredro

500
00:33:42,656 --> 00:33:44,192
Yep

501
00:33:44,448 --> 00:33:44,960
Panthers

502
00:33:45,728 --> 00:33:50,080
Single bed situation

503
00:33:50,336 --> 00:33:56,480
Spoiler request can be made about the recipients

504
00:33:56,736 --> 00:33:58,784
Exceptions to the information that can be released

505
00:33:59,552 --> 00:34:04,928
These are exceptions include involves protecting individual Privacy Information

506
00:34:05,184 --> 00:34:06,208
Illegal to release

507
00:34:07,488 --> 00:34:11,328
Trade Secrets because these are companies that are doing contract work

508
00:34:14,656 --> 00:34:19,264
Also there's an entire exemption related to government information

509
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:23,616
Geographical information on Wells

510
00:34:24,128 --> 00:34:30,272
If you go to foiaonline. Gov you'll be able to find all sorts of information about the government contractors

511
00:34:30,528 --> 00:34:32,576
The contract and agreement

512
00:34:33,344 --> 00:34:37,952
Sorting through all that stuff is really time-intensive in hard so it's easier for me to just make up

513
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:40,000
The contractors are covered

514
00:34:40,512 --> 00:34:45,632
And use that as a bulshit excuse for why she canceled

515
00:34:51,008 --> 00:34:52,544
How does she expect to quantify

516
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:55,360
Most of the work in government is done by contract

517
00:34:56,640 --> 00:35:01,248
60%

518
00:35:01,504 --> 00:35:02,272
Can't be measured

519
00:35:02,784 --> 00:35:05,344
Expect more of that

520
00:35:06,624 --> 00:35:08,928
Expect

521
00:35:09,184 --> 00:35:15,072
Call numbers in trouble

522
00:35:15,328 --> 00:35:17,632
Yeah

523
00:35:18,912 --> 00:35:19,424
Like the course

524
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:23,520
The documentary that I trusted her own

525
00:35:26,848 --> 00:35:31,968
I don't know if I want to double down on what you're saying even though I'm in a documentary

526
00:35:33,504 --> 00:35:35,808
I don't know

527
00:35:36,064 --> 00:35:39,136
Sure

528
00:35:40,416 --> 00:35:41,440
Okay

529
00:35:41,696 --> 00:35:43,232
Man-o-man

530
00:35:43,744 --> 00:35:45,792
Rear window

531
00:35:47,584 --> 00:35:48,096
Tori

532
00:35:48,608 --> 00:35:49,120
Patrick Byrne

533
00:35:50,144 --> 00:35:50,912
Who both work

534
00:35:51,168 --> 00:35:51,680
Stencil

535
00:35:52,448 --> 00:35:52,960
In the shadows

536
00:35:54,752 --> 00:35:55,264
Have come

537
00:35:56,288 --> 00:35:56,800
Revelation

538
00:35:57,568 --> 00:35:58,592
That may be part of the

539
00:35:59,360 --> 00:35:59,872
Whistleblowing

540
00:36:01,408 --> 00:36:01,920
It's not

541
00:36:02,432 --> 00:36:08,576
You might Toria Patrick bergey like a married couple

542
00:36:13,696 --> 00:36:14,976
Very easy to find out who she is

543
00:36:16,768 --> 00:36:18,560
Using some sort of a weird like

544
00:36:19,072 --> 00:36:22,656
She has a f****** Radio Show online

545
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:30,592
There's an interview show where she liked interview Rodger Stone

546
00:36:39,808 --> 00:36:43,392
Alright I had I waited awhile

547
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,584
Patrick is the first to start discussing

548
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:57,984
Situation

549
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:00,544
Show me tutorial little bit later

550
00:37:01,056 --> 00:37:03,360
Patrick talking about

551
00:37:03,872 --> 00:37:05,920
His involvement

552
00:37:08,224 --> 00:37:13,600
How poisonous is the old coronavirus and covid-19

553
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:17,184
Call an internet simulated activity

554
00:37:26,912 --> 00:37:27,680
Use their Spears

555
00:37:28,448 --> 00:37:28,960
You stare

556
00:37:29,472 --> 00:37:29,984
Anxiety

557
00:37:32,032 --> 00:37:33,568
Found anything like endemic

558
00:37:34,848 --> 00:37:35,360
Recognize

559
00:37:39,712 --> 00:37:40,224
To help

560
00:37:41,248 --> 00:37:42,272
We're flexible controller in

561
00:37:42,784 --> 00:37:43,296
Target

562
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:44,832
Whoever it is

563
00:37:46,624 --> 00:37:47,392
Greenfire elect

564
00:37:48,928 --> 00:37:55,072
This is the main reason

565
00:38:04,288 --> 00:38:06,336
Killing people

566
00:38:06,848 --> 00:38:12,992
You never defend this implication that he's making because he doesn't have to Milly just allows them to save a pantechnicon real

567
00:38:13,248 --> 00:38:18,112
Interviews

568
00:38:18,624 --> 00:38:24,768
Does that sound familiar

569
00:38:25,024 --> 00:38:31,168
Sears Melbourne getting out there and trying to tell people about that

570
00:38:31,424 --> 00:38:35,008
Government contractor

571
00:38:35,264 --> 00:38:41,408
Social media psychological warfare called a or Internet interactive internet

572
00:38:41,664 --> 00:38:42,176
Liberties

573
00:38:42,432 --> 00:38:48,576
2008-9 person contact Facebook didn't introduce the like button until February 2009

574
00:38:49,088 --> 00:38:49,856
So that was when

575
00:38:50,112 --> 00:38:51,904
Social media

576
00:38:52,672 --> 00:38:55,744
In 2017 Berkeley released a memoir

577
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,280
Victim of the swamp

578
00:38:57,536 --> 00:38:58,816
How the Deep State destroyed

579
00:38:59,072 --> 00:39:00,096
The 40 year-old private

580
00:39:05,984 --> 00:39:06,496
Invicta

581
00:39:08,288 --> 00:39:14,432
The title is a reference to help listed in the armed services

582
00:39:16,224 --> 00:39:22,368
Yeah we're not

583
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:28,512
The headline is quoted job

584
00:39:30,048 --> 00:39:36,192
Now that's a headline right there

585
00:39:36,448 --> 00:39:37,984
Vascular Associates Cardiology

586
00:39:39,008 --> 00:39:44,128
Rudy claims that he was fired for country before company

587
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:48,224
His boss dr. Klein self and Air Force veteran

588
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:54,624
Zetterberg has stopped showing up for work shortly after he told client on October 3rd of his plan to join the military

589
00:39:59,232 --> 00:40:05,376
1994 Uniformed Services employment employment Rights Act you cannot discriminate against

590
00:40:06,656 --> 00:40:10,752
Andrew required to rehire returning enlisted persons after their active duty is over

591
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:12,032
That would have been a problem

592
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:13,312
However

593
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:17,920
Sweater

594
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:25,088
Comply with federal laws

595
00:40:28,416 --> 00:40:29,696
Insubordinate

596
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,816
$3 charge

597
00:40:35,072 --> 00:40:36,096
Call me companies phone

598
00:40:36,352 --> 00:40:41,216
And was unresponsive to reports of computer problems at the clinic

599
00:40:41,472 --> 00:40:44,032
Do you mean his job

600
00:40:44,544 --> 00:40:47,872
It kind of seems like there is a documentation here that maybe his boss

601
00:40:48,128 --> 00:40:54,272
Air Forces

602
00:40:54,528 --> 00:41:00,672
He was also decided to enlist

603
00:41:00,928 --> 00:41:07,072
Sabotaging thirty-nine-year-old

604
00:41:08,864 --> 00:41:12,192
This was a strange decision.

605
00:41:12,704 --> 00:41:14,240
This was 2005

606
00:41:14,496 --> 00:41:15,264
Which was

607
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:17,568
The beginning of the Iraq War

608
00:41:17,824 --> 00:41:21,920
You can kind of understand people getting swept up in the post 9/11 military

609
00:41:22,176 --> 00:41:24,736
Patriotism

610
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:32,416
I guess even in 2003 when the Iraq invasion was be

611
00:41:32,672 --> 00:41:38,816
The country

612
00:41:39,072 --> 00:41:41,376
Propaganda campaign around

613
00:41:41,632 --> 00:41:44,704
This was 2005

614
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:47,008
Wait 2005 no less

615
00:41:47,264 --> 00:41:50,848
December 13th

616
00:41:54,687 --> 00:41:55,199
2000

617
00:41:56,991 --> 00:42:01,343
So compelled to enlist as a thirty-nine-year-old civilian

618
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:06,463
And two young daughters just doesn't make sense to me based on her PO patriotism

619
00:42:06,975 --> 00:42:09,535
It's pretty difficult to rationalize

620
00:42:09,791 --> 00:42:12,351
Trees being served by the continuation of that war

621
00:42:12,607 --> 00:42:15,679
Assertive person

622
00:42:15,935 --> 00:42:20,031
Country over everything and also I really didn't like my wife

623
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:22,847
So that's that mean country

624
00:42:23,103 --> 00:42:27,711
Like that Cardiology clinic

625
00:42:31,295 --> 00:42:34,111
Another interview that Bergie dead

626
00:42:34,367 --> 00:42:34,879
The truth

627
00:42:35,135 --> 00:42:39,743
Some of the folks are treated like serious people on that ship

628
00:42:39,999 --> 00:42:45,375
Another of Alex's favorites

629
00:42:45,631 --> 00:42:46,911
Danbury bar

630
00:42:47,167 --> 00:42:51,775
That sounds great

631
00:42:52,031 --> 00:42:52,543
Night which is wild

632
00:42:52,799 --> 00:42:54,079
Considering the time in between

633
00:42:54,591 --> 00:42:56,895
The host of that show

634
00:42:57,151 --> 00:42:58,687
Tries to play Aberdeen

635
00:42:59,199 --> 00:43:00,223
And he says this

636
00:43:00,479 --> 00:43:01,759
Which actually made me laugh quite a

637
00:43:04,831 --> 00:43:05,343
Because obviously

638
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:06,367
At40

639
00:43:06,879 --> 00:43:07,903
You got a lot more life

640
00:43:08,415 --> 00:43:08,927
Experience

641
00:43:11,231 --> 00:43:12,255
Mature brain

642
00:43:12,511 --> 00:43:13,279
Thought process

643
00:43:14,303 --> 00:43:15,583
And as you're seeing your physical

644
00:43:18,143 --> 00:43:18,655
Might not

645
00:43:19,167 --> 00:43:19,679
Match that

646
00:43:20,703 --> 00:43:21,471
20 year old

647
00:43:23,263 --> 00:43:24,031
You've got much more

648
00:43:24,287 --> 00:43:25,823
Sophisticated thought process

649
00:43:26,335 --> 00:43:28,895
Experience

650
00:43:30,431 --> 00:43:32,479
In there at the age of 18 there's a

651
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:33,503
Psychological

652
00:43:33,759 --> 00:43:34,527
A nation that goes

653
00:43:35,039 --> 00:43:35,551
Military

654
00:43:35,807 --> 00:43:36,319
It's necessary

655
00:43:36,831 --> 00:43:37,343
Because someone

656
00:43:38,111 --> 00:43:38,879
Take orders

657
00:43:39,391 --> 00:43:40,159
You have that be there

658
00:43:40,927 --> 00:43:41,439
Mental

659
00:43:41,951 --> 00:43:42,463
Rather than

660
00:43:43,231 --> 00:43:43,743
Themselves

661
00:43:44,255 --> 00:43:44,767
Right is this

662
00:43:46,047 --> 00:43:46,815
Should be done would you say that

663
00:43:47,071 --> 00:43:47,583
That's fair

664
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:50,143
Well

665
00:43:50,399 --> 00:43:51,167
Ex-Wives would probably

666
00:43:52,959 --> 00:43:54,751
But yeah

667
00:43:57,567 --> 00:43:58,079
I hear you on that

668
00:43:59,103 --> 00:44:00,895
Oh yes such a freak

669
00:44:08,575 --> 00:44:14,719
For the culture was engaged

670
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:19,327
I want to bring back

671
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:22,911
Water balloons that you fill with urine for this guy

672
00:44:23,167 --> 00:44:27,263
I don't know if those everyone away I just threw up

673
00:44:32,895 --> 00:44:38,527
Bernie Sanders

674
00:44:38,783 --> 00:44:40,831
It's funny because his ex-wife

675
00:44:42,879 --> 00:44:44,671
Ex-wives

676
00:44:44,927 --> 00:44:48,255
Generally I have very little interest

677
00:44:48,511 --> 00:44:49,535
Private

678
00:44:49,791 --> 00:44:51,327
Can't not tell you this okay

679
00:44:51,583 --> 00:44:53,375
Only Amazon page for his book

680
00:44:53,631 --> 00:44:57,215
In the about the author section

681
00:44:57,727 --> 00:44:58,239
Quote

682
00:44:58,495 --> 00:45:04,639
He was divorced in 2010 following several years of deployments overseas and his personal struggle with combat-related PTSD

683
00:45:04,895 --> 00:45:11,039
He was very briefly

684
00:45:18,463 --> 00:45:24,607
!

685
00:45:31,519 --> 00:45:34,335
This will ultimately end up

686
00:45:36,639 --> 00:45:37,919
I do Wonder

687
00:45:38,175 --> 00:45:43,039
Little crazy

688
00:45:43,807 --> 00:45:44,319
But who knows

689
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:45,855
Who

690
00:45:47,135 --> 00:45:47,903
Interesting

691
00:45:48,159 --> 00:45:51,999
Just before deciding to him

692
00:45:53,279 --> 00:45:57,887
In the 2004 election County Supervisor of Elections

693
00:45:58,143 --> 00:45:58,655
Florida

694
00:45:59,167 --> 00:46:01,727
An article about his campaign for the Tampa Bay Times

695
00:46:01,983 --> 00:46:02,495
Very strange

696
00:46:03,263 --> 00:46:08,127
Bernie seemed

697
00:46:09,407 --> 00:46:10,687
Add appearing in public

698
00:46:10,943 --> 00:46:13,247
The upcoming elections are on Tuesday

699
00:46:13,503 --> 00:46:16,319
Sure

700
00:46:18,623 --> 00:46:19,647
I was trying to demand

701
00:46:19,903 --> 00:46:23,231
Equal time

702
00:46:23,487 --> 00:46:27,327
Weird single

703
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:30,911
He was running a dude campaign

704
00:46:31,679 --> 00:46:33,215
Miss Times article

705
00:46:33,471 --> 00:46:34,751
What does Bergey's First Act

706
00:46:35,007 --> 00:46:38,591
Getting into the race was the

707
00:46:41,919 --> 00:46:47,551
Birdie didn't want anyone even considering election supervisor

708
00:46:47,807 --> 00:46:53,951
You wanted to see the moral High Ground because he intended to slam Browning for his very public switched to the Republican

709
00:46:54,463 --> 00:46:55,487
In 2002

710
00:46:55,999 --> 00:47:01,375
In the eyes of many political Observers

711
00:47:01,887 --> 00:47:03,423
Effectively shut the door on any hope

712
00:47:03,679 --> 00:47:04,703
For organized support

713
00:47:05,727 --> 00:47:07,519
We obviously had no

714
00:47:08,031 --> 00:47:09,055
A political identity

715
00:47:09,311 --> 00:47:14,943
Is almost universally pictured bikers for Trump vest

716
00:47:17,247 --> 00:47:18,783
In order to appear

717
00:47:19,295 --> 00:47:22,111
Because he's propaganda

718
00:47:27,743 --> 00:47:32,607
He can't rely on the Party Machine in order to win

719
00:47:32,863 --> 00:47:36,191
The article I read

720
00:47:36,447 --> 00:47:39,263
All the money for a camper blowing from himself and a check for

721
00:47:39,519 --> 00:47:44,383
From family members

722
00:47:56,159 --> 00:47:57,183
Overly Fair

723
00:47:57,439 --> 00:48:03,583
The bergey

724
00:48:04,351 --> 00:48:08,191
Define distrust of the opposition

725
00:48:09,215 --> 00:48:15,359
The election was held on November 2nd 2005 for Santa

726
00:48:17,151 --> 00:48:18,431
Really good

727
00:48:19,455 --> 00:48:25,599
That's surprising for someone we talked about

728
00:48:25,855 --> 00:48:28,415
A run for office don't even make it to voting

729
00:48:28,671 --> 00:48:31,743
3% is a good

730
00:48:31,999 --> 00:48:34,047
Election for bergey

731
00:48:34,303 --> 00:48:40,447
On June 9th 2005 in Florida elections commission filed

732
00:48:43,519 --> 00:48:49,663
According to findings of fact

733
00:48:49,919 --> 00:48:50,687
Designated

734
00:48:51,455 --> 00:48:57,599
On April 18th 2050

735
00:48:58,879 --> 00:48:59,647
And he didn't either

736
00:49:03,487 --> 00:49:07,583
A little while

737
00:49:08,351 --> 00:49:09,887
Very funny is

738
00:49:10,143 --> 00:49:12,959
You joined the military to avoid a $200 by

739
00:49:14,239 --> 00:49:16,287
Screw you

740
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:24,223
December 1st 2006 I can find evidence that he had not paid this for

741
00:49:30,879 --> 00:49:32,927
$125 in pesos

742
00:49:33,695 --> 00:49:38,047
You kind of get this answering this at the commission had a position of like okay fine whatever

743
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:43,423
Whatever they want to expend that much

744
00:49:43,935 --> 00:49:45,471
Time and effort on

745
00:49:45,727 --> 00:49:46,239
200

746
00:49:46,751 --> 00:49:48,031
I'm just saying

747
00:49:48,287 --> 00:49:54,431
That seems like

748
00:49:55,455 --> 00:50:01,599
Okay

749
00:50:01,855 --> 00:50:02,879
So much about going in

750
00:50:03,135 --> 00:50:08,767
Incredibly fair but

751
00:50:09,023 --> 00:50:11,327
This right here is the point where I started to get

752
00:50:11,583 --> 00:50:16,447
Since the bergey was an a******

753
00:50:16,703 --> 00:50:19,263
Still pretty early

754
00:50:19,519 --> 00:50:21,055
But I like Dreamin

755
00:50:21,311 --> 00:50:23,615
With the whizzer open

756
00:50:24,127 --> 00:50:28,479
So he wrote this book which is all but have a deep State destroyed this Noble forty-year-old private

757
00:50:29,247 --> 00:50:30,015
I'm not going to read this book

758
00:50:30,271 --> 00:50:33,855
Mostly because it's

759
00:50:34,367 --> 00:50:39,487
I'm sure it's a fine for not telling his treasurer's report outside

760
00:50:39,743 --> 00:50:40,511
Imma pass

761
00:50:41,279 --> 00:50:46,399
The hinges were Patrick bergey alleges is going on in the world is the term interactive internet activity

762
00:50:47,423 --> 00:50:49,471
This is a term that can definitely go number directions

763
00:50:49,727 --> 00:50:50,751
Depending on how you interpret it

764
00:50:51,775 --> 00:50:57,151
According to bergey and his documentary the way you're supposed to understand he's in the world

765
00:50:57,407 --> 00:51:01,247
Which are props

766
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:08,415
That is to say through meddling with the internet and social media

767
00:51:08,671 --> 00:51:12,255
The activities they desire them to engage

768
00:51:12,767 --> 00:51:14,303
Cigars elaborate

769
00:51:14,815 --> 00:51:19,423
Hyper-specific data-mining that they do and then everything that happens in the world

770
00:51:19,679 --> 00:51:21,983
Is due to their influence campaign

771
00:51:22,239 --> 00:51:28,383
Interactive I mean we have Cambridge analytica

772
00:51:30,175 --> 00:51:35,295
The terminal

773
00:51:36,063 --> 00:51:42,207
One of them a memorandum for secretaries of military departments from June 8th 2007

774
00:51:42,463 --> 00:51:43,999
Excited wave solidifying

775
00:51:44,255 --> 00:51:44,767
Planes

776
00:51:45,279 --> 00:51:46,559
Address down this memo

777
00:51:46,815 --> 00:51:48,607
See the context it's used here

778
00:51:52,703 --> 00:51:56,799
The use of a system accessible internet which allows for communication

779
00:51:57,311 --> 00:51:58,847
UGA email blog

780
00:51:59,103 --> 00:52:01,919
Chat rooms and inner a bulletin board

781
00:52:02,175 --> 00:52:04,223
In a timely is not real time

782
00:52:04,479 --> 00:52:05,759
As opposed to a system in which

783
00:52:06,015 --> 00:52:07,807
Information flows only one way

784
00:52:08,575 --> 00:52:11,135
In essence the term interactive internet

785
00:52:11,391 --> 00:52:12,415
Activities

786
00:52:15,487 --> 00:52:17,023
Action online

787
00:52:17,279 --> 00:52:23,423
I supposed to do things like interviews

788
00:52:23,679 --> 00:52:24,191
22 people

789
00:52:24,447 --> 00:52:25,727
There's a conversation

790
00:52:25,983 --> 00:52:27,519
Being taken

791
00:52:28,799 --> 00:52:31,103
Being done by people from the Department

792
00:52:32,895 --> 00:52:39,039
People are communicating differently online

793
00:52:39,295 --> 00:52:44,159
You know any organizations are not code established

794
00:52:44,927 --> 00:52:51,071
Recognizes

795
00:52:56,191 --> 00:53:01,055
Only public

796
00:53:01,823 --> 00:53:03,871
Strange

797
00:53:04,127 --> 00:53:08,735
No that's got our own PR people to respond to emails and real-time

798
00:53:10,015 --> 00:53:12,831
The other things

799
00:53:13,087 --> 00:53:13,599
Recruitment

800
00:53:13,855 --> 00:53:19,999
Military departments interactive internet

801
00:53:20,255 --> 00:53:22,047
Organizing training

802
00:53:22,815 --> 00:53:27,935
This makes sense

803
00:53:28,191 --> 00:53:29,727
In terms of enlistment none of this

804
00:53:29,983 --> 00:53:34,079
You go online you play some video games on Twitch

805
00:53:37,151 --> 00:53:40,991
7

806
00:53:44,319 --> 00:53:45,599
Everybody in electrical property

807
00:53:46,111 --> 00:53:46,623
Quotes

808
00:53:46,879 --> 00:53:53,023
Messages of materials protected by video and internet

809
00:53:54,303 --> 00:53:57,887
Will comply with relevant intellectual property laws policies and Jackie

810
00:53:58,655 --> 00:54:04,799
Civil based on what Patrick is saying and we'll go on to say I'm supposed to believe that this is a program

811
00:54:05,055 --> 00:54:09,919
Government

812
00:54:10,175 --> 00:54:12,223
They also specifically will not risk

813
00:54:12,479 --> 00:54:14,015
Violating copyright

814
00:54:14,527 --> 00:54:16,063
Which seems a little bit weird

815
00:54:23,999 --> 00:54:30,143
You're in trouble I've had my internet shut off for torrenting, including one published on Army.

816
00:54:30,399 --> 00:54:36,543
September 2009 public relations work under the.

817
00:54:36,799 --> 00:54:38,847
Public relations

818
00:54:39,103 --> 00:54:39,871
And psyops

819
00:54:40,639 --> 00:54:43,967
Coronavirus in this sense

820
00:54:44,223 --> 00:54:45,759
Taking on the responsibility that

821
00:54:46,015 --> 00:54:48,063
Traditionally been associated with the state department

822
00:54:48,319 --> 00:54:50,367
In terms of engaging in public diploma

823
00:54:51,135 --> 00:54:54,719
Concerned

824
00:54:55,999 --> 00:54:58,047
Claims in this film

825
00:54:58,303 --> 00:54:59,839
Particularly about

826
00:55:00,351 --> 00:55:02,399
This document is one of the

827
00:55:04,191 --> 00:55:07,007
The first caveat is this is not applicable

828
00:55:07,263 --> 00:55:08,031
The United States

829
00:55:09,567 --> 00:55:12,383
Selected for an entity

830
00:55:13,151 --> 00:55:15,455
The second is that they specifically say

831
00:55:15,711 --> 00:55:21,343
Internet internet activities

832
00:55:21,855 --> 00:55:27,999
You're trusting that may vary but if your document

833
00:55:30,559 --> 00:55:35,935
They also have other places

834
00:55:36,191 --> 00:55:41,311
Not supposed to

835
00:55:41,567 --> 00:55:47,711
You know at the beginning of an email or correspondence to a representative

836
00:55:52,831 --> 00:55:56,671
There are some Communications that are able

837
00:55:56,927 --> 00:55:57,439
Attributed

838
00:55:57,695 --> 00:56:02,559
But specifically this is only as authorized by the Secretary of State

839
00:56:02,815 --> 00:56:03,583
Or

840
00:56:03,839 --> 00:56:08,703
Named Operation in the war on terror

841
00:56:09,471 --> 00:56:10,495
End the war on terror

842
00:56:18,687 --> 00:56:19,455
Encompass

843
00:56:19,711 --> 00:56:20,991
What patricksburg is going

844
00:56:21,247 --> 00:56:22,015
Present or what

845
00:56:23,807 --> 00:56:29,951
This is a document Personnel within the dod

846
00:56:30,207 --> 00:56:33,023
Best practices

847
00:56:33,279 --> 00:56:36,095
Every terrorist organization propaganda overseas

848
00:56:36,607 --> 00:56:38,399
I'm not saying that it's a great

849
00:56:43,519 --> 00:56:45,055
Recognize

850
00:56:45,311 --> 00:56:48,895
Parentheses from what is being presented

851
00:56:49,151 --> 00:56:52,479
One of the only things they fall back on is this document

852
00:56:52,735 --> 00:56:57,087
And everything will become Central to write

853
00:56:58,623 --> 00:57:02,975
To be clear I like none of the people that we are dealing with now

854
00:57:03,231 --> 00:57:07,071
Like everybody everybody in this documentary I assume

855
00:57:15,263 --> 00:57:15,775
Technology

856
00:57:16,799 --> 00:57:17,823
So here's the layout

857
00:57:19,103 --> 00:57:20,639
Is

858
00:57:20,895 --> 00:57:22,431
This interactive internet activity

859
00:57:22,687 --> 00:57:24,223
And it's

860
00:57:24,479 --> 00:57:25,759
Basically

861
00:57:26,015 --> 00:57:27,807
These demands globalist

862
00:57:28,063 --> 00:57:32,159
Are tricking everybody into rioting and protesting for

863
00:57:32,415 --> 00:57:33,439
Things that are deported

864
00:57:33,695 --> 00:57:34,719
Straight white male

865
00:57:39,327 --> 00:57:41,119
He was a contractor Elijah

866
00:57:43,935 --> 00:57:45,471
Which was Ron

867
00:57:45,727 --> 00:57:47,007
Buy these

868
00:57:49,823 --> 00:57:53,663
Obama's former what was it

869
00:57:53,919 --> 00:57:57,247
Remember who is Homeland Security

870
00:57:57,503 --> 00:58:01,599
It's on run this company called dynology and they have government contract

871
00:58:04,159 --> 00:58:05,183
Patrick bergey

872
00:58:05,439 --> 00:58:05,951
Asserts

873
00:58:07,999 --> 00:58:11,071
In creating a platform called

874
00:58:11,327 --> 00:58:13,887
And also one called I Spy

875
00:58:14,143 --> 00:58:16,703
Psy

876
00:58:16,959 --> 00:58:18,239
Is it funny

877
00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:23,615
Back in the past

878
00:58:26,687 --> 00:58:27,199
Work

879
00:58:32,063 --> 00:58:32,575
Proof that it's

880
00:58:32,831 --> 00:58:33,599
Like a thing

881
00:58:33,855 --> 00:58:35,135
Houston

882
00:58:35,391 --> 00:58:38,975
He's in the world

883
00:58:39,231 --> 00:58:40,767
No no that's not good

884
00:58:41,023 --> 00:58:44,351
Sound like anything familiar to you dance

885
00:58:44,863 --> 00:58:48,703
The unfolding of the George Floyd situation

886
00:58:49,727 --> 00:58:54,591
This looks like shadow

887
00:58:54,847 --> 00:58:59,711
One thing that I will say cuz I would rather

888
00:59:00,223 --> 00:59:02,015
About these

889
00:59:03,039 --> 00:59:05,343
Shadowgate is a better title than shadownet

890
00:59:06,623 --> 00:59:08,927
Yeah yeah

891
00:59:09,183 --> 00:59:10,463
SOI

892
00:59:10,975 --> 00:59:17,119
I was reading over some of Patrick Bergey's writing haha

893
00:59:17,375 --> 00:59:18,655
Credit for chuckle

894
00:59:19,935 --> 00:59:20,703
B

895
00:59:20,959 --> 00:59:24,287
So we get to talkin about this this shadow

896
00:59:25,055 --> 00:59:25,567
This technology

897
00:59:26,335 --> 00:59:27,103
So successful

898
00:59:27,615 --> 00:59:28,127
They could

899
00:59:30,431 --> 00:59:30,943
Do not use

900
00:59:32,223 --> 00:59:32,991
I have the power

901
00:59:33,247 --> 00:59:34,015
Affect

902
00:59:34,783 --> 00:59:35,551
Collections at home

903
00:59:36,319 --> 00:59:36,831
Commercial

904
00:59:37,599 --> 00:59:38,623
Black market value

905
00:59:39,647 --> 00:59:40,159
Technology

906
00:59:40,927 --> 00:59:41,439
In Cal

907
00:59:42,207 --> 00:59:42,719
This is

908
00:59:47,583 --> 00:59:51,679
Motorcycle

909
00:59:51,935 --> 00:59:52,959
I wish

910
00:59:53,215 --> 00:59:55,775
Motorcycle with a sidecar

911
00:59:57,567 --> 00:59:58,079
Okay

912
00:59:58,335 --> 01:00:04,479
Lovett technology

913
01:00:04,735 --> 01:00:09,599
Grammar algorithm or something

914
01:00:10,367 --> 01:00:14,463
If the discussion here is about the creepy ability of social media advertisers

915
01:00:14,719 --> 01:00:17,535
The target people with messaging that's worthwhile conversation

916
01:00:18,047 --> 01:00:21,375
But it becomes an issue when it's flying around

917
01:00:22,143 --> 01:00:28,287
I wanted some more information than the documentary was providing these website

918
01:00:28,799 --> 01:00:32,895
Very consistent in his branding

919
01:00:33,151 --> 01:00:36,735
Your post on there that was meant to lay out the relevant issues story

920
01:00:36,991 --> 01:00:38,783
Apparently according to him

921
01:00:39,039 --> 01:00:39,807
Here's Arcos

922
01:00:40,831 --> 01:00:46,975
He was working for a company called dynology which is working on a social media psychological government

923
01:00:47,231 --> 01:00:47,743
Contract

924
01:00:47,999 --> 01:00:48,511
However

925
01:00:53,631 --> 01:00:59,519
Developed with the name

926
01:00:59,775 --> 01:01:05,919
We're in a serious like Mission Impossible scenario where a private Corporation

927
01:01:06,175 --> 01:01:12,319
Feels that way probably not how I have some feelings

928
01:01:12,831 --> 01:01:18,975
Well the contract with our government

929
01:01:21,279 --> 01:01:24,095
A lot like my eyes were rolling

930
01:01:27,935 --> 01:01:32,031
It's pretty hard to find information about Shadow and that's it doesn't come directly from Patrick Bergin

931
01:01:32,287 --> 01:01:33,567
Shrug

932
01:01:33,823 --> 01:01:34,335
From me

933
01:01:34,591 --> 01:01:37,663
He posted screenshots from dynology website or what

934
01:01:37,919 --> 01:01:44,063
Supposed to be done ologies website there's no link to this artist have to take his word for it that it's a real screenshots yeah but even if

935
01:01:47,135 --> 01:01:53,279
It appears that the service that dynology was selling under the name shadownet was a service that allowed people in the Department of Defense

936
01:01:53,535 --> 01:01:54,815
Safely use the internet

937
01:01:55,071 --> 01:01:55,839
Secure computers

938
01:01:56,607 --> 01:01:57,887
From the screenshot

939
01:01:58,399 --> 01:02:02,751
I need DOD elements lack of proper tools to safely engage BB internet

940
01:02:03,007 --> 01:02:04,031
VIP

941
01:02:04,287 --> 01:02:06,847
Classified Internet Protocol router not working

942
01:02:07,103 --> 01:02:09,663
That typically blocks access to Social Network

943
01:02:09,919 --> 01:02:12,223
Working sites chat sites and other sites.

944
01:02:12,479 --> 01:02:14,527
Information assurance perspective

945
01:02:15,295 --> 01:02:18,111
Customized Security Solutions

946
01:02:18,367 --> 01:02:21,695
Protect organizational assets and resources while working online

947
01:02:22,207 --> 01:02:28,351
Our solution leverages virtualization technology from providers like VMware and Citrix

948
01:02:28,607 --> 01:02:31,423
You safely separate intern internal corporate Networks

949
01:02:31,679 --> 01:02:32,447
From the dangerous

950
01:02:32,703 --> 01:02:34,751
Of the internet providing a safe sandbox

951
01:02:35,263 --> 01:02:37,567
From which you can conduct your internet activity

952
01:02:38,591 --> 01:02:40,639
So it's just like Chinese firewall

953
01:02:40,895 --> 01:02:41,407
What kind of idea

954
01:02:41,663 --> 01:02:47,551
Platform

955
01:02:47,807 --> 01:02:48,319
Yeah

956
01:02:48,575 --> 01:02:53,183
If a desktop is compromised potential damage will be isolated from your internal asset

957
01:02:53,439 --> 01:02:54,207
Contain

958
01:02:54,719 --> 01:03:00,863
It also allows them to wear their real IP address even though probably be bad for the dod networks IP address

959
01:03:01,119 --> 01:03:02,399
I don't know where they are at all times

960
01:03:02,655 --> 01:03:08,799
This is based on Patrick Bergey's presenting as

961
01:03:09,311 --> 01:03:10,591
Pacifica security system

962
01:03:10,847 --> 01:03:12,127
With a name that like catnip

963
01:03:12,383 --> 01:03:13,919
The Conspiracy Theory

964
01:03:14,175 --> 01:03:16,223
We got to deal with people and bad names

965
01:03:21,343 --> 01:03:26,975
The other technology to dynology cells that birdie brings up here is called I Spy pssy

966
01:03:27,231 --> 01:03:31,327
Clients to record and track their online interaction

967
01:03:32,095 --> 01:03:35,679
It appears that this is related to recording things that an individual does

968
01:03:36,959 --> 01:03:42,079
If I'm online interactions that I have

969
01:03:45,663 --> 01:03:48,479
You know you could record that

970
01:03:48,735 --> 01:03:51,807
Extended outside the interactions of your online cell

971
01:03:52,063 --> 01:03:55,391
You were essentially based on what you're telling me

972
01:03:55,647 --> 01:03:56,927
And what he's telling me

973
01:03:57,439 --> 01:03:58,207
He is saying that

974
01:03:58,719 --> 01:04:00,767
Every computer in

975
01:04:01,023 --> 01:04:02,303
Everywhere is in

976
01:04:02,559 --> 01:04:03,071
Affected with

977
01:04:03,327 --> 01:04:04,607
This thing more less

978
01:04:04,863 --> 01:04:08,447
Shadow

979
01:04:08,703 --> 01:04:10,239
Useless the internet

980
01:04:17,407 --> 01:04:20,735
Everything I can sell this is a

981
01:04:22,527 --> 01:04:23,039
Where you can

982
01:04:23,295 --> 01:04:24,063
Create

983
01:04:24,319 --> 01:04:24,831
Perhaps

984
01:04:25,087 --> 01:04:25,599
A fake

985
01:04:25,855 --> 01:04:27,391
Persona

986
01:04:27,647 --> 01:04:28,671
You can interact

987
01:04:29,695 --> 01:04:32,511
Something online and then it will record

988
01:04:33,023 --> 01:04:34,559
Your interaction

989
01:04:35,839 --> 01:04:36,863
Continuity

990
01:04:37,119 --> 01:04:40,191
Like some sort of

991
01:04:41,471 --> 01:04:47,103
Oh no this is happening to me

992
01:04:47,359 --> 01:04:51,455
Present

993
01:04:51,967 --> 01:04:55,039
To secure the dod computers from any possible

994
01:04:55,295 --> 01:04:59,903
I try to record all of the interaction

995
01:05:00,927 --> 01:05:02,975
I don't know let's say you get sick

996
01:05:03,231 --> 01:05:04,767
Someone else can take over at

997
01:05:05,023 --> 01:05:08,351
And see what has been done in terms of

998
01:05:10,143 --> 01:05:12,447
Technology at the same time

999
01:05:12,703 --> 01:05:15,263
I don't see how it rises above the level of like

1000
01:05:15,519 --> 01:05:21,151
Something that makes sense from a law enforcement perspective

1001
01:05:22,431 --> 01:05:28,575
But the evil Shadow neck clams that are being mad

1002
01:05:28,831 --> 01:05:30,111
Dramatic version of screenshot

1003
01:05:30,367 --> 01:05:31,647
You know like

1004
01:05:31,903 --> 01:05:37,023
If you just took a screenshot of every interaction you had yeah put it in a

1005
01:05:37,279 --> 01:05:38,303
Email to somebody

1006
01:05:38,815 --> 01:05:44,959
That would be basically the same thing I don't know what it looks like

1007
01:05:45,215 --> 01:05:50,335
Description

1008
01:05:56,991 --> 01:05:58,271
Woody like a project

1009
01:05:58,527 --> 01:06:00,063
Right

1010
01:06:00,319 --> 01:06:01,599
It makes total sense

1011
01:06:02,111 --> 01:06:03,391
From that standpoint but

1012
01:06:03,647 --> 01:06:04,159
I don't know

1013
01:06:04,927 --> 01:06:11,071
It's about what they're not saying back on that pretty pretty solidly

1014
01:06:12,607 --> 01:06:18,751
Incredibles

1015
01:06:19,007 --> 01:06:21,567
I'm coming around

1016
01:06:22,335 --> 01:06:25,151
So I hear some

1017
01:06:25,663 --> 01:06:27,967
Load of nonsense

1018
01:06:28,223 --> 01:06:29,503
Think that you might not have much

1019
01:06:29,759 --> 01:06:30,271
Ovusense

1020
01:06:30,527 --> 01:06:32,063
Of what Edward Snowden

1021
01:06:32,319 --> 01:06:36,671
Sure

1022
01:06:37,439 --> 01:06:38,463
NSA data

1023
01:06:39,231 --> 01:06:39,999
Collect everything

1024
01:06:40,511 --> 01:06:41,279
What's called

1025
01:06:41,535 --> 01:06:42,047
Upstream

1026
01:06:42,559 --> 01:06:43,071
Forever

1027
01:06:44,607 --> 01:06:45,119
32 hours

1028
01:06:46,911 --> 01:06:48,447
However

1029
01:06:50,751 --> 01:06:51,519
They could private

1030
01:06:52,799 --> 01:06:53,311
Imagine

1031
01:06:54,847 --> 01:06:55,615
No

1032
01:06:57,151 --> 01:06:57,919
Brent

1033
01:06:59,711 --> 01:07:00,223
And

1034
01:07:02,527 --> 01:07:05,599
So claims that she works for John Brennan

1035
01:07:05,855 --> 01:07:07,647
And a project of like

1036
01:07:07,903 --> 01:07:08,671
Mirroring

1037
01:07:08,927 --> 01:07:15,071
Data that they captured upstream or something sure

1038
01:07:15,327 --> 01:07:19,679
Everything with their up screen monitoring which is definitely

1039
01:07:20,191 --> 01:07:25,823
That's a gross mischaracterization of the intelligence community

1040
01:07:26,079 --> 01:07:30,687
Questions about data collection and privacy issues and obviously there are issues a trust

1041
01:07:30,943 --> 01:07:32,223
And the intelligence community

1042
01:07:32,479 --> 01:07:35,551
You can just say whatever you want about this stuff

1043
01:07:36,063 --> 01:07:40,159
Rihanna say absolutely was not forthcoming collection in the past

1044
01:07:47,071 --> 01:07:49,375
Can't play that game

1045
01:07:49,631 --> 01:07:51,167
Them I don't trust

1046
01:07:51,423 --> 01:07:52,959
Facebook

1047
01:07:53,215 --> 01:07:56,799
I don't trust any of these motherfuker

1048
01:07:57,055 --> 01:08:00,895
And that's how I know they're stealing everyone's data and calling

1049
01:08:05,503 --> 01:08:09,855
Trust everything that's said about them

1050
01:08:17,791 --> 01:08:20,863
According to a 2011 report by the foreign intelligence surveillance

1051
01:08:21,119 --> 01:08:21,631
Court Clerk

1052
01:08:21,887 --> 01:08:28,031
Requires more than 250 million internet communications pursuant to section 702

1053
01:08:28,287 --> 01:08:33,151
Majority view Communications internet service providers and are not at issue here

1054
01:08:33,407 --> 01:08:34,943
Indeed nsa's UPS

1055
01:08:35,199 --> 01:08:39,807
Stream collection

1056
01:08:40,063 --> 01:08:42,623
Being acquired by NSA under 702

1057
01:08:43,391 --> 01:08:44,927
Really wants to present the image that

1058
01:08:45,183 --> 01:08:47,231
Upstream projects

1059
01:08:47,487 --> 01:08:49,023
Is actually literally every

1060
01:08:49,279 --> 01:08:52,095
Every call you make every text every website

1061
01:08:54,399 --> 01:08:57,215
What you talkin with his much smaller in scope

1062
01:08:57,983 --> 01:09:01,055
Are definitely legitimate issues surrounding the NSA and Upstream

1063
01:09:01,823 --> 01:09:06,687
The people who are actually fighting this or the ACLU

1064
01:09:06,943 --> 01:09:13,087
Would you never know any group

1065
01:09:13,343 --> 01:09:15,391
She's going to talk to somebody from the AC

1066
01:09:15,647 --> 01:09:16,415
How you write

1067
01:09:21,279 --> 01:09:22,815
And Tori that's a bad

1068
01:09:23,071 --> 01:09:24,607
That's a bad situation

1069
01:09:25,119 --> 01:09:26,911
So the main privacy concern that comes up

1070
01:09:27,167 --> 01:09:28,959
Upstream data collection of internet

1071
01:09:29,471 --> 01:09:31,775
Relate the possibility of an unrelated

1072
01:09:33,055 --> 01:09:39,199
This was because Downstream collected Communications

1073
01:09:39,455 --> 01:09:40,479
Person who was under surveillance

1074
01:09:44,319 --> 01:09:47,903
Collections involves Communications at work or about

1075
01:09:48,415 --> 01:09:50,463
I specifically Best Buy person

1076
01:09:50,719 --> 01:09:53,791
That last category is super hard to pull

1077
01:09:54,047 --> 01:09:56,607
Play Because targeted email address

1078
01:09:57,119 --> 01:09:59,167
And then you collect a message

1079
01:09:59,423 --> 01:10:00,703
Body of the email

1080
01:10:00,959 --> 01:10:03,519
You do that you could have inadvertently spied on a message

1081
01:10:03,775 --> 01:10:07,615
From and two persons who are involved in that prevalence at all

1082
01:10:08,895 --> 01:10:11,711
Search the NSA announced in April 2007

1083
01:10:11,967 --> 01:10:12,735
Teaneck Road

1084
01:10:12,991 --> 01:10:19,135
After considerable evaluation of Technology

1085
01:10:19,391 --> 01:10:20,415
Elgin surveillance activities

1086
01:10:20,671 --> 01:10:25,023
Will no longer include any Upstream internet communications that are solely about

1087
01:10:25,535 --> 01:10:26,815
A foreign intelligence targets

1088
01:10:27,327 --> 01:10:30,399
Instead

1089
01:10:30,655 --> 01:10:33,215
Is that a directly to or from an intelligence

1090
01:10:34,239 --> 01:10:35,007
Intelligent Target

1091
01:10:35,775 --> 01:10:41,151
Of course because you don't need any

1092
01:10:41,407 --> 01:10:47,551
Someone like me

1093
01:10:48,319 --> 01:10:54,463
You earned the

1094
01:10:57,535 --> 01:10:59,071
About it but I don't accept it as a

1095
01:10:59,327 --> 01:11:00,351
Conclusion

1096
01:11:00,607 --> 01:11:04,447
Absolute evil organization

1097
01:11:04,703 --> 01:11:06,239
No

1098
01:11:06,495 --> 01:11:08,287
World Xtreme collections

1099
01:11:08,543 --> 01:11:12,383
Did not collect everything that happened online they stop using it

1100
01:11:15,711 --> 01:11:16,223
2017

1101
01:11:16,991 --> 01:11:21,599
If you work for John Brennan

1102
01:11:21,855 --> 01:11:23,135
Her copy the internet or something

1103
01:11:23,903 --> 01:11:24,415
It's a mess

1104
01:11:24,671 --> 01:11:25,439
I don't believe anything

1105
01:11:25,695 --> 01:11:27,231
Dispersants

1106
01:11:28,255 --> 01:11:29,279
Okay alright

1107
01:11:29,535 --> 01:11:31,583
Does she not take that next step

1108
01:11:31,839 --> 01:11:32,351
And realize

1109
01:11:32,863 --> 01:11:33,887
Were they to collect ever

1110
01:11:34,911 --> 01:11:36,959
They would need the infrastructure of

1111
01:11:37,215 --> 01:11:37,983
Thousands of P

1112
01:11:38,239 --> 01:11:39,519
People to even start

1113
01:11:39,775 --> 01:11:42,335
Trying to sort through a baby

1114
01:11:48,223 --> 01:11:54,367
You got my sister I don't know if it's cuz you're tired but that look on your face was verified

1115
01:11:54,623 --> 01:11:58,463
Play Kono

1116
01:11:59,231 --> 01:12:01,023
It is also I mean

1117
01:12:01,279 --> 01:12:06,911
It is one of the unfortunate

1118
01:12:08,959 --> 01:12:15,103
Appeal to some sort of a magical ability

1119
01:12:15,359 --> 01:12:17,919
Then if we're doing that whole thing

1120
01:12:18,175 --> 01:12:23,807
Programming the algorithm and what bias is it

1121
01:12:24,063 --> 01:12:26,879
I hate them so much already

1122
01:12:28,159 --> 01:12:31,743
She's going to talk about some work that John Brennan had her doing okay

1123
01:12:32,255 --> 01:12:33,023
Hard drive

1124
01:12:33,279 --> 01:12:34,047
Back in 2000

1125
01:12:35,327 --> 01:12:35,839
She claims

1126
01:12:38,399 --> 01:12:38,911
Wild

1127
01:12:40,447 --> 01:12:40,959
And

1128
01:12:41,471 --> 01:12:41,983
Tgin

1129
01:12:43,519 --> 01:12:44,031
Publicly

1130
01:12:44,543 --> 01:12:45,311
Beausoleil

1131
01:12:47,359 --> 01:12:48,383
What can you tell us about the

1132
01:12:48,895 --> 01:12:49,663
CGI Stanley

1133
01:12:51,711 --> 01:12:52,223
Brennan has a

1134
01:12:54,271 --> 01:12:55,039
When he wants to get some

1135
01:12:58,367 --> 01:12:58,879
So

1136
01:12:59,135 --> 01:12:59,647
I was at

1137
01:13:04,511 --> 01:13:05,023
Go by that office

1138
01:13:08,095 --> 01:13:08,863
Leave the cannoli

1139
01:13:16,543 --> 01:13:17,055
Drive

1140
01:13:18,335 --> 01:13:18,847
And then

1141
01:13:21,151 --> 01:13:21,663
M

1142
01:13:28,831 --> 01:13:29,343
I just

1143
01:13:29,599 --> 01:13:30,111
Kind of watch

1144
01:13:30,367 --> 01:13:30,879
What was happening

1145
01:13:31,135 --> 01:13:31,647
One person actually

1146
01:13:32,415 --> 01:13:32,927
Suicide or something

1147
01:13:33,695 --> 01:13:34,207
And the other shoe

1148
01:13:39,839 --> 01:13:40,351
Wow

1149
01:13:40,607 --> 01:13:41,119
Wow

1150
01:13:47,775 --> 01:13:49,311
You to follow up with another like

1151
01:13:50,079 --> 01:13:50,847
Question

1152
01:13:52,639 --> 01:13:54,431
Montgomery Style

1153
01:13:54,687 --> 01:13:57,247
That's fair

1154
01:14:00,831 --> 01:14:03,903
Claims because there's literally no way

1155
01:14:04,159 --> 01:14:05,695
Confirm anything this person saying

1156
01:14:06,207 --> 01:14:07,231
4 Milly

1157
01:14:07,487 --> 01:14:13,119
If you're going to do a documentary we are experts are real weirdos

1158
01:14:13,375 --> 01:14:18,751
Daisy things

1159
01:14:19,007 --> 01:14:20,031
Claims tour

1160
01:14:21,055 --> 01:14:24,383
Story just from the jump

1161
01:14:24,895 --> 01:14:31,039
Millie says Victoria claims to be the person who's behind of Hackettstown

1162
01:14:33,087 --> 01:14:39,231
2008 election passport information was accessed by unauthorized people

1163
01:14:39,487 --> 01:14:45,375
The breaches were traced to three individual incidents Incorporated subcontract

1164
01:14:45,631 --> 01:14:48,447
And the contractor for the analysis Corporation

1165
01:14:48,703 --> 01:14:49,471
Which are different

1166
01:14:50,495 --> 01:14:52,287
The problem is the CGI part

1167
01:14:53,055 --> 01:14:55,615
CGI had nothing to do with these data breaches

1168
01:14:59,455 --> 01:15:04,575
They bought in 2010

1169
01:15:05,087 --> 01:15:11,231
Has nothing to do with the story unless you're somebody who's trying to recreate it

1170
01:15:11,487 --> 01:15:17,119
Is going on here we'd pro quo my buddy so they

1171
01:15:17,887 --> 01:15:18,911
With the other company

1172
01:15:19,167 --> 01:15:21,215
But two years later so as not to make it

1173
01:15:21,471 --> 01:15:21,983
Look suspicious

1174
01:15:22,239 --> 01:15:24,287
They then purchased the other company making those p

1175
01:15:24,543 --> 01:15:26,079
Quid pro quo

1176
01:15:29,663 --> 01:15:35,807
I have no idea what he's talking about 32 miles turning up Dad or whatever but

1177
01:15:36,063 --> 01:15:38,111
Later

1178
01:15:38,367 --> 01:15:44,511
I think one of them committed suicide I'm not going to worry about you

1179
01:15:44,767 --> 01:15:50,911
I'm not sure

1180
01:15:54,239 --> 01:15:55,519
Don't 2000

1181
01:15:58,079 --> 01:16:00,895
They made it look like it was a

1182
01:16:03,455 --> 01:16:04,991
He wasn't really even hack it was

1183
01:16:05,503 --> 01:16:07,295
Contractors

1184
01:16:07,551 --> 01:16:08,831
Just access the information

1185
01:16:12,415 --> 01:16:13,695
Yeah it's kind of a cyst

1186
01:16:13,951 --> 01:16:15,743
Accident really

1187
01:16:15,999 --> 01:16:17,023
It was not an exit

1188
01:16:20,351 --> 01:16:22,399
So she goes in there

1189
01:16:23,423 --> 01:16:28,031
Information

1190
01:16:28,287 --> 01:16:28,799
In

1191
01:16:29,055 --> 01:16:31,871
Or something

1192
01:16:33,151 --> 01:16:33,663
Which

1193
01:16:33,919 --> 01:16:34,431
If it wasn't

1194
01:16:34,687 --> 01:16:35,199
Heck

1195
01:16:36,223 --> 01:16:36,991
Resume

1196
01:16:39,295 --> 01:16:40,063
In off of

1197
01:16:40,831 --> 01:16:41,343
Servers

1198
01:16:42,879 --> 01:16:43,391
So that

1199
01:16:46,207 --> 01:16:46,719
What would be the point

1200
01:16:48,255 --> 01:16:48,767
Hide

1201
01:16:49,023 --> 01:16:49,791
Well if I were

1202
01:16:54,655 --> 01:16:55,679
Big presumption again

1203
01:17:04,895 --> 01:17:11,039
Started yet

1204
01:17:11,551 --> 01:17:16,927
She said

1205
01:17:18,207 --> 01:17:18,719
Right now

1206
01:17:18,975 --> 01:17:19,487
Intuit

1207
01:17:19,743 --> 01:17:21,023
Wrong blues

1208
01:17:21,279 --> 01:17:22,559
So this this clip

1209
01:17:23,071 --> 01:17:24,607
Like it might have been

1210
01:17:28,191 --> 01:17:29,727
Deep into the documentary

1211
01:17:29,983 --> 01:17:34,847
This might be about where I lost my mind and I wanted to yell at the people who are

1212
01:17:36,639 --> 01:17:38,175
You're Sober

1213
01:17:38,431 --> 01:17:40,991
Better than you

1214
01:17:41,503 --> 01:17:42,783
So what is the relationship

1215
01:17:43,807 --> 01:17:44,575
Global strategy

1216
01:17:46,111 --> 01:17:46,879
Analysis

1217
01:17:52,255 --> 01:17:53,023
Are the Jacksonville

1218
01:17:54,047 --> 01:17:54,559
Except for the

1219
01:17:55,327 --> 01:17:55,839
That

1220
01:17:57,375 --> 01:17:57,887
Was actually

1221
01:18:00,447 --> 01:18:00,959
For All In

1222
01:18:03,519 --> 01:18:04,287
None of this

1223
01:18:04,543 --> 01:18:08,127
Prune anyway

1224
01:18:12,479 --> 01:18:17,855
A wholly-owned subsidiary of global strategy group

1225
01:18:22,719 --> 01:18:28,351
Do they all do the same thing

1226
01:18:28,607 --> 01:18:30,911
Material concrete connection

1227
01:18:33,471 --> 01:18:35,007
You would have to do research

1228
01:18:37,567 --> 01:18:38,591
I thought my pretty voice

1229
01:18:38,847 --> 01:18:43,967
Also Millie thinks Incorporated stands for Canadian Global Information

1230
01:18:44,223 --> 01:18:45,503
Which it actually doesn't

1231
01:18:46,015 --> 01:18:50,367
It's a French name which is called Sierra on guest

1232
01:18:51,135 --> 01:18:53,695
Which Loosely translates to management

1233
01:18:54,463 --> 01:18:57,279
Since grown into a

1234
01:19:01,375 --> 01:19:07,263
Global Information because the first line of their Wikipedia page

1235
01:19:07,519 --> 01:19:10,079
Which describes them as a Canadian

1236
01:19:10,335 --> 01:19:11,103
Incompetent

1237
01:19:11,871 --> 01:19:17,247
The next paragraph literally would have explained

1238
01:19:17,503 --> 01:19:19,807
The government and industries in order to preserve

1239
01:19:20,831 --> 01:19:25,695
I don't know what the connection is if there is any between

1240
01:19:25,951 --> 01:19:29,535
I do know however that just saying companies all

1241
01:19:29,791 --> 01:19:33,119
Have a lot of Divisions in them isn't strong enough of an argument

1242
01:19:33,375 --> 01:19:37,727
Didn't correct Milian

1243
01:19:41,311 --> 01:19:42,591
Pretty trouble

1244
01:19:45,663 --> 01:19:51,807
I'm noticing hahaha

1245
01:19:52,063 --> 01:19:55,903
Instead of the the screams I'm seeing in my mind's eye Millie Weaver

1246
01:19:56,159 --> 01:19:58,463
And a giant explosion of urine all over her

1247
01:19:58,719 --> 01:19:59,231
Sure

1248
01:19:59,487 --> 01:20:01,023
I wish I didn't say it like that

1249
01:20:01,279 --> 01:20:01,791
But

1250
01:20:02,303 --> 01:20:03,071
We

1251
01:20:04,863 --> 01:20:07,167
We all need visualization exercises

1252
01:20:07,423 --> 01:20:07,935
Sometimes

1253
01:20:08,191 --> 01:20:14,336
I'm so ugly

1254
01:20:14,592 --> 01:20:20,736
Battery charge

1255
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:26,368
I don't know Gra

1256
01:20:27,136 --> 01:20:30,464
His son is listed in all the stuff that I was Finding

1257
01:20:30,976 --> 01:20:35,840
Possible that the father was also involved

1258
01:20:36,608 --> 01:20:41,216
Richard burgi apparently work for

1259
01:20:42,240 --> 01:20:44,288
The other villain is John Brennan

1260
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:49,920
Former director of the CIA for short time

1261
01:20:53,504 --> 01:20:55,552
Rapid City area

1262
01:21:04,768 --> 01:21:05,280
The passport

1263
01:21:05,536 --> 01:21:06,048
Sure

1264
01:21:07,840 --> 01:21:13,728
Tori is going to say that she was that person or something

1265
01:21:15,008 --> 01:21:16,032
It's convoluted

1266
01:21:16,288 --> 01:21:22,432
Are we

1267
01:21:22,688 --> 01:21:25,504
Has been all over the world

1268
01:21:25,760 --> 01:21:31,648
40 years ago, he's not as I can tell

1269
01:21:35,232 --> 01:21:37,280
This person like the paper trail

1270
01:21:37,536 --> 01:21:40,864
Not true

1271
01:21:41,376 --> 01:21:41,888
John Brennan

1272
01:21:42,144 --> 01:21:42,656
Working

1273
01:21:43,168 --> 01:21:44,192
Network of Contracting

1274
01:21:45,216 --> 01:21:46,240
Such as Dan

1275
01:21:47,008 --> 01:21:47,776
Canadian

1276
01:21:48,032 --> 01:21:48,544
Information

1277
01:21:49,056 --> 01:21:50,080
And the analysis

1278
01:21:51,616 --> 01:21:52,128
Top 10

1279
01:21:52,384 --> 01:21:52,896
Senator Burr

1280
01:21:53,152 --> 01:21:54,176
Barack Obama

1281
01:21:54,432 --> 01:21:54,944
Get elect

1282
01:21:55,712 --> 01:21:56,224
Using

1283
01:21:56,736 --> 01:21:57,504
Internet info

1284
01:21:58,016 --> 01:21:58,528
Operation

1285
01:21:59,296 --> 01:22:00,064
March 5th

1286
01:22:00,320 --> 01:22:00,832
2030

1287
01:22:01,600 --> 01:22:02,112
Brennan gets

1288
01:22:02,880 --> 01:22:03,392
STI

1289
01:22:03,648 --> 01:22:04,672
Director John Legend

1290
01:22:04,928 --> 01:22:05,440
Controversy

1291
01:22:07,232 --> 01:22:08,256
In the CIA in

1292
01:22:08,512 --> 01:22:09,536
Interrogation

1293
01:22:10,816 --> 01:22:11,584
This makes no sense

1294
01:22:11,840 --> 01:22:15,168
For 1 million saying Canadian Global Information again

1295
01:22:15,424 --> 01:22:15,936
Is not a real cop

1296
01:22:16,704 --> 01:22:21,056
Second-guessing about the sentence

1297
01:22:21,568 --> 01:22:27,712
Corporation

1298
01:22:27,968 --> 01:22:29,248
The hacker

1299
01:22:29,504 --> 01:22:31,552
Zero evidence to suggest

1300
01:22:32,832 --> 01:22:34,880
Just people accessing the data has been provided

1301
01:22:35,136 --> 01:22:36,672
It just hearsay of one person

1302
01:22:37,440 --> 01:22:43,328
Operation from 2005 to 2011 order to accept

1303
01:22:43,584 --> 01:22:44,096
Denomination

1304
01:22:44,352 --> 01:22:47,424
From Obama to be the deputy National Security advisor

1305
01:22:47,936 --> 01:22:52,288
I don't know if there's any connection between Stanley Incorporated

1306
01:22:52,544 --> 01:22:54,080
Outside

1307
01:23:00,224 --> 01:23:03,296
Early isn't

1308
01:23:04,064 --> 01:23:07,136
The thing that's stopping people from doing it is

1309
01:23:07,648 --> 01:23:08,416
It triggers a response

1310
01:23:08,672 --> 01:23:09,440
And you will get in trouble

1311
01:23:10,208 --> 01:23:12,768
In a New York Times article about the 2000s

1312
01:23:13,024 --> 01:23:15,328
Department spokesperson Sean McCormick

1313
01:23:15,584 --> 01:23:17,888
Discusses how Hillary Clinton

1314
01:23:18,144 --> 01:23:18,912
The previous summer

1315
01:23:19,168 --> 01:23:20,192
Context

1316
01:23:20,448 --> 01:23:24,032
Training exercise to pull up someone's file

1317
01:23:24,544 --> 01:23:30,688
Usually at least training circumstances family members name just for training Pope

1318
01:23:30,944 --> 01:23:35,296
The person that wanted man

1319
01:23:35,552 --> 01:23:37,600
Delray

1320
01:23:37,856 --> 01:23:42,976
It would immediately recognize they were immediately admonished

1321
01:23:43,744 --> 01:23:48,608
The undersecretary of State for management said the department had automatic control

1322
01:23:48,864 --> 01:23:52,704
Public Access

1323
01:23:53,216 --> 01:23:56,544
In the case of mr. Obama and Mr McInnes

1324
01:23:56,800 --> 01:23:57,312
We're open

1325
01:23:58,080 --> 01:24:03,456
Apparently super easy for the information to be accessed by people who we trust

1326
01:24:03,968 --> 01:24:04,992
Surprise

1327
01:24:05,248 --> 01:24:05,760
The contractors

1328
01:24:06,016 --> 01:24:07,808
Two different firm for able to access

1329
01:24:08,576 --> 01:24:12,416
It really just means that there were multiple people who didn't believe it when someone told them

1330
01:24:12,672 --> 01:24:14,464

Every story but until two years later

1337
01:24:42,624 --> 01:24:48,768
There's no reason for Millie to claim the debris has proven the brennity

1338
01:24:52,096 --> 01:24:57,984
CIA director

1340
01:25:01,312 --> 01:25:07,456
The first is the Brennan specifically withdrew his name from consideration for the position of CIA director in Obama's first term

1341
01:25:08,736 --> 01:25:11,040
Brings up

1342
01:25:11,296 --> 01:25:13,856
He had supported Bush's enhanced interrogation

1343
01:25:14,624 --> 01:25:18,976
Knowing that he accepted the position of assistant to the president

1344
01:25:19,232 --> 01:25:21,024
Which doesn't require Senate confirmation

1345
01:25:21,792 --> 01:25:24,352
Also million

1346
01:25:24,608 --> 01:25:30,752
Public supporter of an advisor to then-senator Barack Obama

1347
01:25:37,152 --> 01:25:43,296
When was already on a short list of names to be nominated for positions like CIA director or

1348
01:25:43,808 --> 01:25:45,856
There's nothing that Millie is saying here

1349
01:25:46,112 --> 01:25:48,160
We can actually be proven or seems to mean anything

1350
01:25:48,416 --> 01:25:48,928
Yeah

1351
01:25:49,184 --> 01:25:50,464

I'm not actually did she has no idea

1407
01:27:52,576 --> 01:27:56,416

There's no evidence

1411
01:28:07,424 --> 01:28:08,704
Tori is describing

1412
01:28:08,960 --> 01:28:09,472
Is happening

1413
01:28:09,728 --> 01:28:15,872
If she's just talkin about the Upstream collections that's very small percentage

1414

Would you describing something really scary though

1417
01:28:23,808 --> 01:28:29,184
Probably impossibly complicated

1418
01:28:29,696 --> 01:28:35,840
Literally everything everything online is collected in the 72-hour hold

1419
01:28:36,096 --> 01:28:38,912
Everybody

1420
01:28:39,168 --> 01:28:44,032

From actual internet service providers which is in contrast out stream collection works

1423
01:29:05,792 --> 01:29:08,608
The book and and

1424
01:29:09,120 --> 01:29:11,936
Watch the documentary through all of this

1425
01:29:12,448 --> 01:29:17,824
I realize I really thought that Snowden was going to send all this data to a non-existent company

1426
01:29:18,080 --> 01:29:24,224
Need to find out that it was confirmed by Millie Weaver that he saw it all

1427
01:29:27,040 --> 01:29:28,832
Analysis Corporation is a real

1428
01:29:29,856 --> 01:29:33,952
But that's the problem enough

1429
01:29:34,464 --> 01:29:40,608
Pools of reality that if you're not careful you can get yourself tricked into thinking like

1430
01:29:40,864 --> 01:29:41,632
This is real

1431
01:29:41,888 --> 01:29:44,192
And then you're like what's Canadian Global Information

1432
01:29:45,472 --> 01:29:45,984
Problem

1433
01:29:46,496 --> 01:29:49,824
I don't know if she started

1434
01:29:50,080 --> 01:29:52,128
Which is what clear for today

1435
01:29:52,384 --> 01:29:56,224
Eddie Bauer

1436
01:29:56,480 --> 01:30:02,624
Because I failed the multiple-choice

1437
01:30:03,904 --> 01:30:07,488
2004

1438
01:30:08,768 --> 01:30:12,864
I got a little note in the mail that said that I didn't live the Eddie Bauer lifestyle

1439
01:30:15,424 --> 01:30:21,568
That's that's enough to cause a revolution hurt

1440
01:30:24,128 --> 01:30:29,504
Did Eddie Bauer in Uber

1441
01:30:29,760 --> 01:30:34,368
I feel like you should have been should have been the other way around

Sensitive

1443
01:30:52,800 --> 01:30:55,360
I have some check someplace I love the idea

1444
01:30:55,616 --> 01:30:57,408
That we are all the way

1445
01:30:57,664 --> 01:30:59,456
In a year that begins with a

1446
01:30:59,712 --> 01:31:00,992
The two

1447
01:31:02,016 --> 01:31:08,160
Snowden happened and then the government's like s*** screening people

1448
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:13,792
Yeah we've been around for awhile

1449
01:31:16,096 --> 01:31:22,240
They later if that's thrown around like sheep

1450
01:31:26,848 --> 01:31:29,920
Call Thing 1 and Thing 2 and then we'll number of until we're done

1451
01:31:32,480 --> 01:31:33,760
One of them more

1452

1454
01:31:37,344 --> 01:31:38,624

1461
01:31:57,568 --> 01:32:00,640
About a thing called the Congressional

1462
01:32:00,896 --> 01:32:04,224
Knowledge system

1463
01:32:04,736 --> 01:32:08,576
As I understand it from the things that I was able to find

1464
01:32:12,928 --> 01:32:13,952
Gather

1465
01:32:14,208 --> 01:32:16,768
Publicly-available represent

1466
01:32:17,024 --> 01:32:18,816
So it will have

1467
01:32:19,072 --> 01:32:23,936
Like meetings scheduled publicly-available

1468
01:32:24,192 --> 01:32:26,496
And then you can cross-reference that with like who was

1469
01:32:26,752 --> 01:32:32,384
I assume it has like a strong potential for like

1470
01:32:32,640 --> 01:32:35,456
For networking

1471
01:32:35,712 --> 01:32:40,064
Essentially all of the stuff that would be on it

1472
01:32:40,320 --> 01:32:46,464
You know you find this platform is stuff that you could find if you wanted to take forever to find

1473
01:32:46,720 --> 01:32:52,864
Create an algorithm

I understand that

1476
01:32:55,424 --> 01:32:56,704
The sense that I get

1477
01:32:57,216 --> 01:32:57,728
From looking

1478
01:33:02,336 --> 01:33:04,640

1479
01:33:05,152 --> 01:33:06,944

1481
01:33:15,136 --> 01:33:15,904
That is suspect

1482
01:33:20,256 --> 01:33:22,560
I didn't think that you was making something up because it is

1483
01:33:24,608 --> 01:33:26,144
Became an issue where I was like

1484
01:33:28,192 --> 01:33:29,216
And I wasted hours

1485
01:33:33,824 --> 01:33:34,592

I did pray sit down and

1523
01:34:53,184 --> 01:34:59,328
Apparently making stuff up okay

1524
01:34:59,584 --> 01:35:02,912
Call dollars

1525
01:35:03,168 --> 01:35:09,312
It appears to be for some kind of data processing hosting and related services

1526
01:35:10,336 --> 01:35:11,616
Primary places performing

1527
01:35:12,640 --> 01:35:15,200
There's other screwy things about this award but just don't

1528
01:35:16,736 --> 01:35:21,344
Operation cost 160 Grand

1529
01:35:21,856 --> 01:35:28,000
Yeah that's a problem

1530
01:35:32,352 --> 01:35:33,376
A couple hours

1531
01:35:33,632 --> 01:35:35,424
Looking for

1532
01:35:35,680 --> 01:35:36,960
Like details

1533
01:35:37,216 --> 01:35:38,752
I can explain this

1534
01:35:39,264 --> 01:35:45,408
Pretty clearly what does look f***** up

1535
01:35:45,664 --> 01:35:46,176
Sure

1536
01:35:49,760 --> 01:35:54,112
The first installment of it was paid in February 2018

1537
01:35:54,368 --> 01:35:55,648
526.

1538
01:35:56,416 --> 01:35:58,208
Then in January 16th

1539
01:35:58,464 --> 01:36:01,280
4107

1540
01:36:03,072 --> 01:36:06,912
But on April 28th 2009

1541
01:36:07,168 --> 01:36:08,448
Return to the US government

1542
01:36:08,960 --> 01:36:09,472
Then

1543
01:36:09,728 --> 01:36:11,008
In January 2010

1544
01:36:11,264 --> 01:36:15,360
$92,586

1545
01:36:16,896 --> 01:36:19,968
It seems like an imitation better 2009

1546
01:36:20,224 --> 01:36:22,016
You failed to fulfill their end of the contract

1547
01:36:22,272 --> 01:36:23,040
Then work

1548
01:36:23,552 --> 01:36:27,392
Really hard to say exactly

1549
01:36:27,648 --> 01:36:30,720
Congressional calendar

1550
01:36:30,976 --> 01:36:34,048
Which is

1551
01:36:34,560 --> 01:36:35,840
Congressional knowledge services

1552
01:36:43,776 --> 01:36:47,616
I think that's a great way to you know I want the government run like a business

1553
01:36:47,872 --> 01:36:53,504
Something is up here

1554
01:36:54,272 --> 01:37:00,160
This page on usaspending.gov

1555
01:37:00,416 --> 01:37:01,440
Cmks

1556
01:37:01,696 --> 01:37:04,768
Hosting labor admin / cord

1557
01:37:05,280 --> 01:37:11,424
You can jump to conclusions if you want and report US Congress calendar data on

1558
01:37:11,680 --> 01:37:12,448
Server in Germany

1559
01:37:18,080 --> 01:37:18,848
All right here's my pic

1560
01:37:20,128 --> 01:37:21,664
Spying on Hitler who didn't die

1561
01:37:22,176 --> 01:37:22,688
Could be

1562
01:37:23,200 --> 01:37:26,272
Here's my attempt to clear this up I respect your

1563
01:37:26,528 --> 01:37:29,600
160g

1564
01:37:31,136 --> 01:37:34,976
I suspect sumption in

1565
01:37:35,232 --> 01:37:36,256
Siempre esta

1566
01:37:37,536 --> 01:37:39,072
She says that this contract

1567
01:37:40,608 --> 01:37:46,752
Of the Congressional

1568
01:37:47,008 --> 01:37:49,568
Posting labor slash

1569
01:37:49,824 --> 01:37:50,592
She's referring to okay

1570
01:37:51,360 --> 01:37:54,944
She's interpreting it as being the Professional Knowledge system which is

1571
01:37:55,200 --> 01:37:56,224
Calendar

1572
01:37:58,528 --> 01:38:01,344
Involve the Congressional service

1573
01:38:02,368 --> 01:38:03,648
This is the only contract

1574
01:38:03,904 --> 01:38:04,672
I went through about your phone

1575
01:38:04,928 --> 01:38:06,720
Abbreviated

1576
01:38:06,976 --> 01:38:09,792
Because I don't think that's what's DMT stand for

1577
01:38:10,304 --> 01:38:12,608
I think it stands for customer master key

1578
01:38:13,120 --> 01:38:15,168
Which are something that are used in cloud computing

1579
01:38:16,192 --> 01:38:19,520
The contract has been awarded

1580
01:38:19,776 --> 01:38:22,336
The awarding is

1581
01:38:23,104 --> 01:38:25,152
Contract

1582
01:38:25,408 --> 01:38:26,944
Explorer cmk

1583
01:38:27,200 --> 01:38:31,296
Is the office that's titled 0409

1584
01:38:31,552 --> 01:38:32,064
Cute

1585
01:38:32,320 --> 01:38:34,112
This is the only contract

1586
01:38:34,368 --> 01:38:38,464
And if you search for more information about it the office itself

1587
01:38:38,720 --> 01:38:41,536
You'll find a bunch of contracts per us regional office

1588
01:38:41,792 --> 01:38:42,560
In Bavaria

1589
01:38:43,072 --> 01:38:47,168
Contractors dynology been awarded early Shield of it and networks

1590
01:38:47,424 --> 01:38:51,520
Possibly were contracted by us stationed in Korea

1591
01:38:51,776 --> 01:38:55,104
To help with the customer master keys

1592
01:38:55,360 --> 01:38:56,640
And Billy saw the Abreva

1593
01:38:56,896 --> 01:38:58,432
Abbreviation cmks

1594
01:38:58,688 --> 01:39:01,504
And assume must be related to the Congressional knowledge system

1595
01:39:02,016 --> 01:39:02,784
Because three of the letters

1596
01:39:04,576 --> 01:39:07,136
Even if that's the case you completely f**** it up

1597
01:39:07,904 --> 01:39:14,048
She calls me Congressional Knowledge Management System which of these ckms not cmks

1598
01:39:23,776 --> 01:39:25,824
You'll notice that the contract for the German

1599
01:39:26,080 --> 01:39:27,360
Started

1600
01:39:27,616 --> 01:39:29,920
Prior to this in February 2000

1601
01:39:30,176 --> 01:39:30,688
Which is weird

1602
01:39:34,016 --> 01:39:37,088
Expired it doesn't appear to have been active at least since 2015

1603
01:39:37,856 --> 01:39:39,648
Everything I can tell there's no reason

1604
01:39:39,904 --> 01:39:40,928
This contract that was

1605
01:39:41,184 --> 01:39:41,952
Performed

1606
01:39:42,208 --> 01:39:42,976
Connection

1607
01:39:43,232 --> 01:39:44,000
The other contract

1608
01:39:44,256 --> 01:39:44,768
Exit

1609
01:39:45,024 --> 01:39:46,816
Or has anything to do

1610
01:39:47,072 --> 01:39:48,864
We can grab a congressional knowledge system

1611
01:39:49,376 --> 01:39:51,168
Millie just

1612
01:39:51,424 --> 01:39:53,472
Assume that based on that

1613
01:39:53,728 --> 01:39:54,496
Yeah

1614
01:39:55,776 --> 01:39:57,312
Sloppy

1615
01:39:57,568 --> 01:39:58,848
What you just explained right there

1616
01:39:59,616 --> 01:40:01,920
Is the nail in the coffin for when

1617
01:40:02,432 --> 01:40:04,736
If you made it this far into the documentary

1618
01:40:05,248 --> 01:40:05,760
You just turned it

1619
01:40:06,272 --> 01:40:09,856
You would never notice if you didn't look up recorded books were all these

1620
01:40:10,112 --> 01:40:14,464
Trucking contracts took forever

1621
01:40:21,120 --> 01:40:23,680
How did we get here

1622
01:40:23,936 --> 01:40:24,960
More work

1623
01:40:25,472 --> 01:40:27,520
Finding out the acronym

1624
01:40:27,776 --> 01:40:29,056
Then she did on the

1625
01:40:29,312 --> 01:40:34,944
Higher f****** documentary part of it

1626
01:40:35,456 --> 01:40:36,224
I really do.

1627
01:40:36,480 --> 01:40:37,760
Excited

1628
01:40:38,016 --> 01:40:39,040
Looking at that

1629
01:40:44,672 --> 01:40:47,232
React something we make sense

1630
01:40:47,488 --> 01:40:52,352
Why is it is one contract for Germany that's related to the Congressional

1631
01:40:52,608 --> 01:40:56,448
Knowledge system

1632
01:40:56,960 --> 01:40:59,520
The prefix

1633
01:41:02,592 --> 01:41:03,872
It's probably that the acronym wrong

1634
01:41:04,128 --> 01:41:06,688
Yeah

1635
01:41:06,944 --> 01:41:08,992
As an abbreviation in cloud computing

1636
01:41:09,248 --> 01:41:11,808
There's no reason to suspect

1637
01:41:12,064 --> 01:41:18,208
You're just making up

1638
01:41:18,464 --> 01:41:21,024
All around the world I wouldn't be surprised if

1639
01:41:21,280 --> 01:41:22,816
One of them Pizza.

1640
01:41:25,632 --> 01:41:28,960
Uncommon for

1641
01:41:29,216 --> 01:41:31,008
A bunch of different it companies

1642
01:41:31,264 --> 01:41:32,288
Perhaps provide

1643
01:41:32,544 --> 01:41:34,080
Fulfillment of the contract

1644
01:41:38,688 --> 01:41:44,832
Maybe they did it and didn't do a great job which is why as much

1645
01:41:47,904 --> 01:41:49,952
I don't know there's a hundred possibilities that are

1646
01:41:50,208 --> 01:41:54,816
Wheatley not nefarious

1647
01:41:55,072 --> 01:41:55,840
And you just jumps to the

1648
01:41:56,096 --> 01:41:56,608
Conclusion

1649
01:42:02,752 --> 01:42:03,264
Congressional

1650
01:42:03,520 --> 01:42:04,032
They have

1651
01:42:04,288 --> 01:42:10,432
Congress has information on this

1652
01:42:11,456 --> 01:42:11,968
I just

1653
01:42:12,224 --> 01:42:16,832
I'm just not going to buy 160g doing it

1654
01:42:17,088 --> 01:42:19,392
Spy on the Congress for only 100

1655
01:42:22,976 --> 01:42:24,000
Risk

1656
01:42:24,256 --> 01:42:24,768
Risk

1657
01:42:25,024 --> 01:42:25,792
Alone

1658
01:42:26,048 --> 01:42:31,936
30 million dollars even if you accept every misinterpretation the cheese-making is true

1659
01:42:32,448 --> 01:42:36,032
This contract ended payout

1660
01:42:36,544 --> 01:42:38,080
Yes so I don't know what the

1661
01:42:38,336 --> 01:42:38,848
We relation

1662
01:42:39,104 --> 01:42:40,384
Send a text to the present day

1663
01:42:41,408 --> 01:42:42,688
If you're spying on the government

1664
01:42:44,480 --> 01:42:45,248
Vertagear

1665
01:42:46,528 --> 01:42:49,344
And then they're like you did a bad job that you have to give back

1666
01:42:49,600 --> 01:42:51,136
Dollars

1667
01:42:51,392 --> 01:42:57,280
That's a red flag

1668
01:42:57,536 --> 01:43:01,120
Streams that are going sort of simultaneously

1669
01:43:01,376 --> 01:43:06,752
You have decided things right

1670
01:43:08,800 --> 01:43:13,152
Congress by the short and curlies

1671
01:43:13,408 --> 01:43:15,968
Guitar World

1672
01:43:16,224 --> 01:43:19,296
Because they do these I operations they face

1673
01:43:19,552 --> 01:43:20,320
Glade can

1674
01:43:20,832 --> 01:43:22,112
Make

1675
01:43:22,368 --> 01:43:24,928
And they do it on the cheap that's what you need

1676
01:43:25,952 --> 01:43:27,232
Then you have Tori

1677
01:43:27,488 --> 01:43:30,048
And she work for John Brennan through whatever

1678
01:43:30,304 --> 01:43:36,448
He has access to every computer

1679
01:43:37,216 --> 01:43:42,848
So you can do everything through the computers control the Congress

1680
01:43:45,408 --> 01:43:51,552
Completely

1681
01:43:51,808 --> 01:43:54,880
Fact whatsoever

1682
01:44:06,144 --> 01:44:07,424
They are doing a disservice

1683
01:44:07,680 --> 01:44:08,192
Spider-Man

1684
01:44:08,448 --> 01:44:14,592
Terrible documentary that doesn't prove anything

1685
01:44:14,848 --> 01:44:19,200
Computers

1686
01:44:24,064 --> 01:44:24,576
Compromise

1687
01:44:27,904 --> 01:44:28,672

The house

1692
01:44:39,680 --> 01:44:40,448
And the Sun

1693
01:44:41,216 --> 01:44:41,728
Staggering

1694
01:44:43,776 --> 01:44:44,544
Prove anything

1695
01:44:46,080 --> 01:44:46,848
Birdy

1696
01:44:47,104 --> 01:44:51,456
Comes back now

1697
01:44:51,712 --> 01:44:55,552
This technology I-5 because PSI like psychology

1698
01:44:56,832 --> 01:44:57,344
PS

1699

Psy

1701

You mean eyesight

1702
01:45:07,840 --> 01:45:08,352
Okay

1703
01:45:08,864 --> 01:45:13,472
Anyways

1704
01:45:15,264 --> 01:45:21,408
We end up with one of the

1705
01:45:27,040 --> 01:45:29,600
It's a pretty simple explanation for why they're wrong

1706

You're alright

1715
01:45:59,040 --> 01:45:59,808
Then you need to be able to

The leadership

1719
01:46:21,056 --> 01:46:21,568
Do

1720
01:46:22,848 --> 01:46:23,360
Provide

1721
01:46:28,224 --> 01:46:28,736
Asset

1722
01:46:29,504 --> 01:46:30,016
Journalist

1723
01:46:32,576 --> 01:46:33,088
News Oregon

1724
01:46:37,952 --> 01:46:38,976
An individual you

1725
01:46:40,512 --> 01:46:41,280
It could be anybody

1726
01:46:41,792 --> 01:46:42,304
Like that

1727
01:46:43,840 --> 01:46:44,352
Build them

1728
01:46:44,864 --> 01:46:45,376
Scratch

1729
01:46:48,960 --> 01:46:49,472
According

1730
01:46:49,728 --> 01:46:50,240
Birdy

1731
01:46:50,752 --> 01:46:51,520
The 2012

1732
01:46:54,848 --> 01:46:55,616
2012

1733
01:46:56,128 --> 01:46:56,640
Open

1734
01:46:56,896 --> 01:46:57,408
What

1735
01:46:57,920 --> 01:46:58,944
For domestic is

1736
01:46:59,712 --> 01:47:00,224
Social me

1737
01:47:02,528 --> 01:47:07,904
Things Fall Apart

1738
01:47:08,160 --> 01:47:08,928
Some type of cancer

1739
01:47:09,184 --> 01:47:11,488
The fantasy world where

1740
01:47:12,256 --> 01:47:17,376
Operation so why would anyone take my word for it

1741
01:47:17,888 --> 01:47:23,520
Places that involve

1742
01:47:23,776 --> 01:47:27,104
In foreign countries which some propaganda

1743
01:47:27,616 --> 01:47:32,480
P2007 policy guideline on I-84 an exam

1744
01:47:39,648 --> 01:47:44,256
Terrorist propaganda

1745
01:47:47,328 --> 01:47:53,472
I feel like having the conversation about whether or not public relations messaging

1746
01:47:55,776 --> 01:48:01,664
The only reason that these people can argue

1747
01:48:01,920 --> 01:48:05,760
Social unrest

1748
01:48:06,016 --> 01:48:07,808
Comically sized conspiracy against them

1749
01:48:08,064 --> 01:48:09,344
Is because they believe that

1750
01:48:09,600 --> 01:48:10,624
Before he left office

1751
01:48:10,880 --> 01:48:11,904
Obama made legal

1752
01:48:12,160 --> 01:48:18,304
Government modernization Act of 2010

1753
01:48:19,072 --> 01:48:20,864
Is Millie references the back clip

1754
01:48:21,376 --> 01:48:27,264
This is literally all the result of one instance of bad reporting by the late Michael Hastings of BuzzFeed

1755
01:48:30,080 --> 01:48:36,224
Smith-mundt act never had anything to do with regulating the Pentagon reports in the Run

1756
01:48:36,480 --> 01:48:38,528
Perform

1757
01:48:38,784 --> 01:48:39,296
In January

1758
01:48:40,064 --> 01:48:43,648
What example included a report in the lake BuzzFeed reporter Michael Hastings

1759
01:48:43,904 --> 01:48:49,792
Modernization act propaganda of us audience

1760
01:48:50,560 --> 01:48:51,072
In fact

1761
01:48:51,328 --> 01:48:56,192
1970

1762
01:48:57,728 --> 01:48:59,520
New circulated regarding

1763
01:48:59,776 --> 01:49:03,360
Besmirch the displeasure of Representative Republic

1764
01:49:03,616 --> 01:49:06,176
The sponsor of the smith-mundt modernization ACT

1765
01:49:06,432 --> 01:49:06,944
2012

1766
01:49:07,456 --> 01:49:13,600
3 it's fascinating as a case study in how one blogger was pretty sloppy not understanding the issue and then except

1767
01:49:13,856 --> 01:49:15,136
Picked up by politico's Playbook

1768
01:49:15,392 --> 01:49:17,696
And you had one level of sloppiness on top of another

1769
01:49:17,952 --> 01:49:19,744
Thornbury told the cable last night

1770
01:49:20,256 --> 01:49:22,816
And want something Sensational gets out there and spreads like wildfire

1771
01:49:23,328 --> 01:49:24,864
Yeah that is fascinating

1772
01:49:25,888 --> 01:49:31,776
The smith-mundt modernization Act only applies to the broadcasting Board of Governors which contains things like Voice of America

1773
01:49:32,544 --> 01:49:38,688
News item items and programs that are available support

1774
01:49:38,944 --> 01:49:42,016
Spectre America Angela Banks

1775
01:49:42,784 --> 01:49:45,344
The modernization Act was prompted by to consideration

1776
01:49:46,112 --> 01:49:51,232
The first was that previously the products of the broadcasting Board of Governors was available in the United

1777
01:49:52,512 --> 01:49:54,304
You know that was when there was radio in

1778
01:49:54,560 --> 01:49:55,072
TV

1779
01:49:55,328 --> 01:49:58,400
Primary meme

1780
01:49:59,424 --> 01:50:00,448
Be increasingly

1781
01:50:00,704 --> 01:50:03,776
Possible to guarantee

1782
01:50:04,032 --> 01:50:10,176
Get radio stations from across the world

1783
01:50:10,432 --> 01:50:15,552
Like Chinese firewall around America really

1784
01:50:15,808 --> 01:50:19,904
Really really hard

1785
01:50:20,160 --> 01:50:25,536
Programming communities in the United States

1786
01:50:26,048 --> 01:50:32,192
For instance there's a large Somali American community in St Paul

1787
01:50:32,448 --> 01:50:36,288
United States

1788
01:50:36,800 --> 01:50:41,920
Meanwhile they would have access to other sources from smog

1789
01:50:43,968 --> 01:50:45,760
So that's one of the consideration

1790
01:50:46,272 --> 01:50:52,160
The important thing to take away from this is that the smith-mundt modernization ACT did not legalize using propaganda on America

1791
01:50:52,416 --> 01:50:54,208
Can citizens of the people like birdie likes

1792
01:50:54,464 --> 01:50:54,976
Pretend

1793
01:50:55,232 --> 01:51:01,376
Act like after that point the Pentagon and CIA were taking over every Newsroom in the country when in reality

1794
01:51:01,632 --> 01:51:05,728
Section of government

1795
01:51:05,984 --> 01:51:11,104
The programme was already being created

1796
01:51:11,360 --> 01:51:11,872
Carquest

1797
01:51:12,128 --> 01:51:14,944
Actress very clear on page 5 saying

1798
01:51:15,200 --> 01:51:21,344
No funds authorized appropriated to the Department of State or the broadcasting Board of Governors Chevy used

1799
01:51:21,600 --> 01:51:22,880
Wikipedia in the United States

1800
01:51:24,160 --> 01:51:26,720
It's a very standard talking points people on the extreme right

1801
01:51:26,976 --> 01:51:32,096
Conspiracy world

1802
01:51:32,352 --> 01:51:38,496
United States

1803
01:51:38,752 --> 01:51:39,264
Wanted to

1804
01:51:39,776 --> 01:51:43,872
If they want to complain about

1805
01:51:44,128 --> 01:51:45,152
A completely different conversation

1806
01:51:46,432 --> 01:51:47,456
So cool

1807
01:51:50,528 --> 01:51:51,296
So I

1808
01:51:52,064 --> 01:51:53,600
I don't quite understand

1809
01:51:55,392 --> 01:51:57,184
If you're if you're telling me

1810
01:51:57,952 --> 01:52:00,512
Obama legalize propaganda the United

1811
01:52:01,536 --> 01:52:03,584
And I took over newsrooms

1812
01:52:04,864 --> 01:52:08,192
Including podcast

1813
01:52:08,704 --> 01:52:09,216
Then

1814
01:52:11,776 --> 01:52:17,920
Why is it that they often reference those news organizations when they want to use them to prove

1815
01:52:18,176 --> 01:52:18,688
Who's their point

1816
01:52:23,296 --> 01:52:27,136
Literally literally everything propaganda

1817
01:52:27,392 --> 01:52:33,024
Because the time

1818
01:52:33,280 --> 01:52:38,400
Allow them to do

1819
01:52:38,656 --> 01:52:39,936
What I like

1820
01:52:41,984 --> 01:52:42,496
Alright

1821
01:52:42,752 --> 01:52:45,568
Okay so here's a magic

1822
01:52:46,848 --> 01:52:50,432
This is this is actually good for your conspiracy

1823
01:52:50,688 --> 01:52:51,456
Theory documentary

1824
01:52:51,712 --> 01:52:57,856
Right don't call it by

1825
01:53:02,208 --> 01:53:02,720
Okay

1826
01:53:02,976 --> 01:53:03,744
So that means

1827
01:53:04,000 --> 01:53:04,512
That if they're can

1828
01:53:04,768 --> 01:53:08,352
Controlling newsrooms and I sometimes use them to agree with

1829
01:53:08,608 --> 01:53:09,120
With myself

1830
01:53:09,376 --> 01:53:10,912
And I sometimes use them to disagree

1831
01:53:11,168 --> 01:53:11,936
The other people

1832
01:53:12,448 --> 01:53:13,728
Then the government

1833
01:53:14,240 --> 01:53:16,032
Is planting information

1834
01:53:16,288 --> 01:53:17,568
For both sides

1835
01:53:18,080 --> 01:53:19,104
All the time

1836
01:53:19,360 --> 01:53:20,384
Creating this

1837
01:53:20,640 --> 01:53:22,944
Great Divide in the United States

1838
01:53:23,200 --> 01:53:23,968
All there

1839
01:53:24,480 --> 01:53:24,992
Right

1840
01:53:25,248 --> 01:53:26,016
That's what you say

1841
01:53:28,832 --> 01:53:29,344
Sure

1842
01:53:30,368 --> 01:53:31,392
Difficult time processing

1843
01:53:34,976 --> 01:53:41,120
Killer Burger

1844
01:53:41,376 --> 01:53:42,400
Also a

1845
01:53:43,168 --> 01:53:44,704
I'm so

1846
01:53:45,216 --> 01:53:49,312
Frustrated by this documentary now

1847
01:53:49,568 --> 01:53:54,688
I realize this makes me angry

1848
01:53:55,712 --> 01:53:57,760
This product or not

1849
01:53:58,016 --> 01:53:59,040
Dunya

1850
01:53:59,296 --> 01:54:03,904
How is it we're not done yet

1851
01:54:04,160 --> 01:54:10,304
I'll be up all night

1852
01:54:10,560 --> 01:54:14,656
Hours for the rest of the night

1853
01:54:20,032 --> 01:54:21,056
IPhone

1854
01:54:21,312 --> 01:54:23,872
You know if they were created movies smartphone technology

1855
01:54:24,128 --> 01:54:28,992
Were they created in order for the military to run II operation

1856
01:54:29,504 --> 01:54:30,016
This

1857
01:54:30,528 --> 01:54:31,808
Is where I started at

1858
01:54:32,320 --> 01:54:33,088
Detect a trend

1859
01:54:33,600 --> 01:54:34,624
In mr. Burger

1860
01:54:36,672 --> 01:54:37,184
Smart device

1861
01:54:58,432 --> 01:54:58,944
Look it up

1862
01:55:00,992 --> 01:55:01,504
Modernism

1863
01:55:02,528 --> 01:55:03,040
Modified

1864
01:55:03,808 --> 01:55:04,320
To allow

1865
01:55:08,416 --> 01:55:08,928
Propaganda

1866
01:55:19,424 --> 01:55:19,936
Is that

1867
01:55:20,448 --> 01:55:20,960
What's the weather

1868
01:55:22,496 --> 01:55:23,008
Allowing it

1869
01:55:25,568 --> 01:55:26,080
And then what

1870
01:55:30,944 --> 01:55:31,456
With the Obama phone

1871
01:55:33,504 --> 01:55:35,552
Get the f*** out

1872
01:55:35,808 --> 01:55:41,184
Get the f*** out

1873
01:55:41,440 --> 01:55:42,208
Usually

1874
01:55:42,720 --> 01:55:43,232
Are you go

1875
01:55:46,048 --> 01:55:52,192
Yourself attitude

1876
01:55:52,448 --> 01:55:55,264
Yeah I might be a little bit

1877
01:55:56,032 --> 01:55:57,824
Nefarious

1878
01:55:58,080 --> 01:56:04,224
Because it was really sometime closed when its memo came out sure

1879
01:56:04,480 --> 01:56:08,064
Obama

1880
01:56:08,320 --> 01:56:09,088
They're not related

1881
01:56:09,600 --> 01:56:11,136
This is not well ordered thinking

1882
01:56:11,648 --> 01:56:16,256
Who's the person is actually making random connections between. So you can tell the story that he wants to

1883
01:56:16,768 --> 01:56:22,912
You do not get to just point the two things

1884
01:56:23,424 --> 01:56:28,288
Sure the memo and the release of the first iPhone 7

1885
01:56:32,128 --> 01:56:37,760
Like this for an example

1886
01:56:38,016 --> 01:56:42,112
Was in retaliation for the previous day's release of the movie Ratatouille

1887
01:56:44,928 --> 01:56:45,696
Glasgow

1888
01:56:45,952 --> 01:56:46,976
He's that movie

1889
01:56:47,232 --> 01:56:49,024
If they were connected

1890
01:56:49,280 --> 01:56:55,424
I'm close to the same time

1891
01:56:55,680 --> 01:56:56,704
Action is even more bizarre

1892
01:56:56,960 --> 01:56:58,496
Hutu things are absolutely

1893
01:56:59,264 --> 01:57:05,408
If it were broken and only picked up

1894
01:57:08,992 --> 01:57:12,832
Subtly racist ways this conspiracy theory starting to manifest

1895
01:57:13,088 --> 01:57:16,672
It's a pretty Stark example of birdies

1896
01:57:16,928 --> 01:57:22,560
I was wondering when we were going to get there was no way that we were

1897
01:57:22,816 --> 01:57:28,448
It had to

1898
01:57:29,216 --> 01:57:29,984
Also suggest

1899
01:57:35,104 --> 01:57:35,616
Dad

1900
01:57:36,128 --> 01:57:36,640
Play date

1901
01:57:37,664 --> 01:57:38,176
Control

1902
01:57:38,688 --> 01:57:39,200
Fostering

1903
01:57:39,456 --> 01:57:40,224
The Ferguson riot

1904
01:57:51,744 --> 01:57:55,840
Enable B outrageous. Connecting and living in a world devoid of standard 27

1905
01:57:56,608 --> 01:58:01,728
The unrest in Ferguson took place in August 2014 in

1906
01:58:01,984 --> 01:58:06,848
Connection by Michael Brown

1907
01:58:07,616 --> 01:58:11,712
The community was unhappy about the shooting and how is being handled come out of nowhere

1908
01:58:12,224 --> 01:58:15,552
There's a pattern

1909
01:58:16,832 --> 01:58:22,976
If you do that video of a woman talking about Obama phone from late 2012 and notices

1910
01:58:23,232 --> 01:58:25,536
Protesters in Ferguson

1911
01:58:26,304 --> 01:58:26,816
Oh boy

1912
01:58:27,072 --> 01:58:29,376
People who are interested in doing good job don't accept

1913
01:58:29,632 --> 01:58:35,520
Things like this as being anything other than an indication of someone not being a person

1914
01:58:36,288 --> 01:58:40,384
This response could go a long way toward explaining

1915
01:58:40,896 --> 01:58:44,992
The Patrick

1916
01:58:45,248 --> 01:58:46,528
Because that uses technology

1917
01:58:47,040 --> 01:58:48,320
To control people

1918
01:58:48,576 --> 01:58:50,368
This this this whole thing of

1919
01:58:50,624 --> 01:58:51,136
Him

1920
01:58:51,392 --> 01:58:52,928
What time

1921
01:58:53,440 --> 01:58:55,232
Milly responding

1922
01:58:56,256 --> 01:58:57,280
Humoring Lee

1923
01:58:57,536 --> 01:58:59,072
Or accepting Lehi

1924
01:59:01,376 --> 01:59:03,680
The Patrick bergey receipt

1925
01:59:03,936 --> 01:59:05,472
I think there's a pattern

1926
01:59:05,728 --> 01:59:11,872
It is life

1927
01:59:14,176 --> 01:59:14,944
Appropriately

1928
01:59:15,456 --> 01:59:16,224
What is website

1929
01:59:16,480 --> 01:59:17,248
He posted

1930
01:59:17,504 --> 01:59:22,624
Elevator version of story that reads

1931
01:59:23,136 --> 01:59:24,416
Here are some of the passages

1932
01:59:24,672 --> 01:59:28,768
Elevator pitch

1933
01:59:29,024 --> 01:59:35,168
She said passages suggest to me this is either a Long Island

1934
01:59:35,424 --> 01:59:36,448
God

1935
01:59:36,704 --> 01:59:40,800
No I know but that there exists more than one. So much

1936
01:59:41,824 --> 01:59:45,152
Shadownet is a social media project management tool

1937
01:59:45,408 --> 01:59:51,552
The Washington Post 2017 when I first work with a few others

1938
01:59:52,064 --> 01:59:54,880
My story after about a month of going back and forth

1939
01:59:55,648 --> 02:00:01,792
Rudy says to report on it looked into some of the things you would realize they were talking to

1940
02:00:02,048 --> 02:00:03,328
Conspiracy theorist weirdo

1941
02:00:03,840 --> 02:00:09,728
That kind of work before they accept information

1942
02:00:09,984 --> 02:00:11,008
And decide that it's worth

1943
02:00:11,264 --> 02:00:12,288
Reporting on

1944
02:00:12,544 --> 02:00:16,384
Quote actually spoke to me

1945
02:00:16,640 --> 02:00:22,528
Interview me in a private room for about 45 minutes but I never heard from them again

1946
02:00:24,064 --> 02:00:30,208
Burgundy you can easily see how this exchange is B of A

1947
02:00:34,304 --> 02:00:36,608
The only 15 minutes

1948
02:00:36,864 --> 02:00:38,144
Was they were having

1949
02:00:38,400 --> 02:00:38,912
A great

1950
02:00:40,448 --> 02:00:40,960
Exact

1951
02:00:42,496 --> 02:00:48,640
The House and Senate members I've submitted multiple memorandums of Records

1952
02:00:48,896 --> 02:00:51,456
Customers

1953
02:00:51,968 --> 02:00:56,064
I'm open to any other facts based argument

1954
02:00:56,320 --> 02:01:00,928
I've literally spoken to Matt gaetz and Lindsey Graham

1955
02:01:01,184 --> 02:01:01,696
Let me cricket

1956
02:01:03,744 --> 02:01:07,328
You can see how an accident on anyone parking easily to come prove it

1957
02:01:07,584 --> 02:01:12,960
They themselves are in on the future of unchecked delusional paranoia

1958
02:01:13,728 --> 02:01:19,872
The problem is the gauge of the world

1959
02:01:20,384 --> 02:01:21,152
Is proven correct

1960
02:01:21,664 --> 02:01:25,248
If you go tell Matt gaetz about this Stephanie takes it seriously you can work with that

1961
02:01:25,760 --> 02:01:27,040
He ignores you that he's

1962
02:01:27,296 --> 02:01:29,600
Probably secretly in on the conspiracy against you

1963
02:01:29,856 --> 02:01:32,160
If he speaks out

1964
02:01:32,416 --> 02:01:34,208
This information doesn't check

1965
02:01:40,608 --> 02:01:41,376
Conspiracy ship

1966
02:01:41,632 --> 02:01:46,752
If it's constructed in the matter what happens

1967
02:01:47,264 --> 02:01:53,408
This is like how Alex Warren

1968
02:01:53,664 --> 02:01:55,200
Has coverage

1969
02:01:55,456 --> 02:01:56,224
Stop the attack

1970
02:01:57,248 --> 02:02:00,064
Trust people who act that way

1971
02:02:00,320 --> 02:02:01,600
This last past

1972
02:02:01,856 --> 02:02:03,136
Is particularly dramatic

1973
02:02:03,392 --> 02:02:04,928
That's a little bit longer but I think it's worth

1974
02:02:06,208 --> 02:02:08,512
Patrick Bergey's Dan bongino show

1975
02:02:09,024 --> 02:02:09,536
On TV

1976
02:02:09,792 --> 02:02:11,840
And you like somebody cover it

1977
02:02:13,120 --> 02:02:15,168
But he thinks that has never full story

1978
02:02:16,960 --> 02:02:23,104
Not knowing who to trust I felt a strong almost calling if you will that I needed to meet Dan bongino

1979
02:02:26,432 --> 02:02:31,552
Some people suggest

1980
02:02:31,808 --> 02:02:33,344
Could have been further from the truth

1981
02:02:34,112 --> 02:02:38,208
Hoping you would help but I didn't know if you was a good guy or bad guy

1982
02:02:38,464 --> 02:02:39,744
Entrust Sarah

1983
02:02:40,000 --> 02:02:42,304
That's a person who

1984
02:02:42,560 --> 02:02:44,352
I think you might have been working for judge

1985
02:02:44,608 --> 02:02:48,192
Jeanine Pirro

1986
02:02:48,704 --> 02:02:50,496
I wasn't questioning bongino's honor

1987
02:02:50,752 --> 02:02:51,776
I was counting on him having

1988
02:02:52,544 --> 02:02:58,688
Patreon

1989
02:02:58,944 --> 02:03:04,832
Florida

1990
02:03:06,112 --> 02:03:08,160
Obviously this is a very long shot

1991
02:03:08,416 --> 02:03:14,560
My absolute surprising supporter

1992
02:03:16,096 --> 02:03:18,656
Is A-Rod

1993
02:03:20,192 --> 02:03:23,264
Along with airline tickets to join me!

1994
02:03:23,776 --> 02:03:27,616
I pick Susan up at the Tampa Airport Thursday morning and we drove straight to the event

1995
02:03:32,736 --> 02:03:34,784
That's another story for itself on another day

1996
02:03:35,552 --> 02:03:39,392
This elevator

1997
02:03:39,904 --> 02:03:42,976
I am no longer interested whatever floor I'm going to

1998
02:03:43,232 --> 02:03:48,352
I'm opening the doors

1999
02:03:49,376 --> 02:03:54,240
Update exhaust rolling through the tiniest hole that I can get that

2000
02:03:54,496 --> 02:03:57,312
I need to get out of this elevator

2001
02:03:58,848 --> 02:04:00,640
We got there and register

2002
02:04:00,896 --> 02:04:07,040
As we walked around

2003
02:04:09,856 --> 02:04:15,744
I needed to see for myself if he had honor and integrity was just another member of the DC swamp

2004
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:16,512
And then

2005
02:04:17,280 --> 02:04:21,888
A few days later on Twitter

2006
02:04:22,144 --> 02:04:28,288
Metaphorical

2007
02:04:28,544 --> 02:04:30,336
Honor question

2008
02:04:30,848 --> 02:04:32,128
0

2009
02:04:34,176 --> 02:04:38,528
Describe what she saw when I first told Dan who I was

2010
02:04:38,784 --> 02:04:42,368
She felt afraid of something when he saw me and I felt the same thing

2011
02:04:42,880 --> 02:04:46,976
Having followed a couple years

2012
02:04:47,232 --> 02:04:48,768
Social media

2013
02:04:49,280 --> 02:04:52,096
And I like you respect someone with a gun

2014
02:04:52,608 --> 02:04:54,656
Little did I know he was a snowflake

2015
02:05:01,312 --> 02:05:03,872
Fox News contract

2016
02:05:04,384 --> 02:05:10,528
Again but I haven't heard any reasonable

2017
02:05:10,784 --> 02:05:16,928
Argument so far

2018
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:20,512
There is a

2019
02:05:20,768 --> 02:05:21,280
Factbase

2020
02:05:22,304 --> 02:05:27,424
The getaway is a fact-based freaking people out

2021
02:05:28,704 --> 02:05:32,800
Leftover the reasonable arguments

2022
02:05:33,056 --> 02:05:37,664
Interactions

2023
02:05:37,920 --> 02:05:39,712
External perspective

2024
02:05:39,968 --> 02:05:46,112
Norbit

2025
02:05:46,368 --> 02:05:52,512
The close talker to

2026
02:05:55,328 --> 02:05:55,840
Suspect

2027
02:05:56,096 --> 02:05:57,120
I would probably ask

2028
02:05:57,376 --> 02:06:00,960
Exactly the same way

2029
02:06:01,216 --> 02:06:07,360
I am not a shadow net customer

2030
02:06:10,944 --> 02:06:14,016
Remember the last time

2031
02:06:14,784 --> 02:06:17,856
Yeah alright

2032
02:06:18,112 --> 02:06:19,392
Houston

2033
02:06:21,440 --> 02:06:24,768
Unsympathetic

2034
02:06:25,280 --> 02:06:29,376
Now it's time to go Hog Wild

2035
02:06:29,632 --> 02:06:31,936
Canario

2036
02:06:32,192 --> 02:06:32,960
Run from Ukraine

2037
02:06:37,312 --> 02:06:37,824
Can you do

2038
02:06:38,080 --> 02:06:44,224
Extension of a conversation about Obama phone

2039
02:06:44,480 --> 02:06:45,760
Just black people

2040
02:06:46,016 --> 02:06:47,552
We're calling them

2041
02:06:52,160 --> 02:06:52,672
Howie's

2042
02:06:54,208 --> 02:06:54,720
Starter

2043
02:06:55,232 --> 02:06:55,744
Riot

2044
02:06:57,024 --> 02:06:57,536
You had the

2045
02:06:59,072 --> 02:06:59,584
Data

2046
02:07:01,632 --> 02:07:02,144
So you can

2047
02:07:05,728 --> 02:07:06,496
Target

2048
02:07:10,080 --> 02:07:10,848
Pushing

Tailoring

2051
02:07:18,528 --> 02:07:19,296
And when I

2052
02:07:32,864 --> 02:07:33,376
Michael brown rice

2053
02:07:41,568 --> 02:07:42,336

2055
02:07:44,896 --> 02:07:45,408
What I believe

2056
02:07:50,528 --> 02:07:51,296
No

2057
02:07:54,112 --> 02:08:00,256
Couple things

2058
02:08:00,512 --> 02:08:02,304
Programs through

2059
02:08:02,560 --> 02:08:03,584
Was like Obama song

2060
02:08:03,840 --> 02:08:05,120
His responses

2061
02:08:06,400 --> 02:08:08,448
That's a very suspicious response

2062
02:08:08,704 --> 02:08:09,216
Park

2063
02:08:09,984 --> 02:08:11,008
The second figure Jordan

2064
02:08:11,520 --> 02:08:14,336
More details.

2065
02:08:20,736 --> 02:08:23,552
In Ferguson in around the country prompted by what happened in Ferguson

2066
02:08:23,808 --> 02:08:26,112
CIA

2067
02:08:26,624 --> 02:08:30,208
An unnamed call traceroute

2068
02:08:31,744 --> 02:08:34,304
Burger spot with IRA

2069
02:08:34,560 --> 02:08:35,840
What does it mean

2070
02:08:36,352 --> 02:08:37,376
What is the thing you trace

2071
02:08:40,192 --> 02:08:41,984
I searched his website for Ferguson

2072
02:08:42,752 --> 02:08:45,056
Information

2073
02:08:45,568 --> 02:08:49,664
I'm absolutely no idea what he's talking about

2074
02:08:49,920 --> 02:08:51,968
Just ask any follow-up questions

2075
02:08:52,224 --> 02:08:53,760
I saw I strongly

2076
02:08:54,016 --> 02:08:59,904
Strongly suspected on sublevel whole thing falls apart

2077
02:09:02,464 --> 02:09:03,744
So

2078
02:09:04,000 --> 02:09:05,280
So what you're telling me

2079
02:09:05,536 --> 02:09:06,304
Is that the

2080
02:09:06,560 --> 02:09:07,584
The government the dod

2081
02:09:09,632 --> 02:09:10,144
Right

2082
02:09:10,400 --> 02:09:10,912
To get

2083
02:09:11,424 --> 02:09:13,216
Communities

2084
02:09:13,728 --> 02:09:14,496
Whenever they want

2085
02:09:14,752 --> 02:09:15,264
It right

2086
02:09:16,544 --> 02:09:18,080
Yeah I guess at the fair

2087
02:09:18,592 --> 02:09:24,224
Assessment of some of the activities

2088
02:09:24,480 --> 02:09:26,784
Because one way to get communities to Riot

2089
02:09:27,040 --> 02:09:31,136
Is to start a country based on enslaving an entire race of people

2090
02:09:31,648 --> 02:09:32,672
Alright then

2091
02:09:32,928 --> 02:09:39,072
When that slavery is over create different ways to continuance

2092
02:09:39,584 --> 02:09:40,864
Forever and then just start

2093
02:09:41,120 --> 02:09:42,912
Straight up murdering them over and over

2094
02:09:43,168 --> 02:09:45,472
I mean

2095
02:09:45,728 --> 02:09:51,872
Leaving aside the sort of grandeur picture that you're talking about the inciting event

2096
02:09:52,128 --> 02:09:55,968
Just dismissed entirely provided by

2097
02:09:59,040 --> 02:09:59,808
I think it's weird

2098
02:10:00,064 --> 02:10:03,904
Not just not maybe

2099
02:10:04,416 --> 02:10:06,720

Want to get lost in a week

2148
02:11:59,872 --> 02:12:04,992
If you go and consult the Infowars article that Millie released about the subject it all traces back to One Source

2149
02:12:05,760 --> 02:12:06,784
Kentucky journalist

2150
02:12:07,040 --> 02:12:07,808

Spell tore which is how this woman in this

2152
02:12:12,416 --> 02:12:16,768
This is the same person who's the second interview subject in this documentary

2153
02:12:17,024 --> 02:12:19,328
The subject of the Kentucky election

2154
02:12:20,352 --> 02:12:24,192
Primary source

2155
02:12:24,448 --> 02:12:27,776
Happens to be the person who's the primary source on this story

2156
02:12:28,032 --> 02:12:29,056
Probably because

2157
02:12:29,312 --> 02:12:30,592
You f****** suspicious of s***

2158
02:12:34,688 --> 02:12:35,200

2160
02:12:37,248 --> 02:12:43,392
I always look for a Lea

2161
02:12:44,160 --> 02:12:45,184
Butthole story about the

2162
02:12:45,440 --> 02:12:45,952
Kentucky election

2163
02:12:46,208 --> 02:12:49,536
Making an allegation

2164
02:12:49,792 --> 02:12:51,072
Another Republican

2165
02:12:51,328 --> 02:12:55,168
Her husband is not a citizen where is registered Democrats

2166
02:12:55,424 --> 02:12:55,936
In Kentucky

2167
02:12:56,448 --> 02:13:02,592
She insisted this was proof that the Democrats are failing the voter rolls of state election and Billy reported on the story and

2168
02:13:02,848 --> 02:13:03,360
Incessantly

2169
02:13:03,872 --> 02:13:10,016
Unfortunately propublica Kentucky registration form

2170
02:13:10,272 --> 02:13:11,552
Democrat when they registered to vote

2171
02:13:11,808 --> 02:13:13,600
In Fayette County in 2008

2172
02:13:14,112 --> 02:13:14,624
Her husband

2173
02:13:14,880 --> 02:13:15,392
Linda

2174
02:13:15,648 --> 02:13:21,792
That's a real last name

2175
02:13:23,840 --> 02:13:27,424
Why do the form carries a penalty of fines or jail time of up to 12 months

2176
02:13:28,192 --> 02:13:34,336
A couple records show have never removed themselves from the rolls or change their registration status until November 8th of

2177
02:13:39,200 --> 02:13:39,968
No

2178
02:13:46,624 --> 02:13:48,672
Do that difficult

2179
02:13:48,928 --> 02:13:49,696
For reporting on them

2180
02:13:50,720 --> 02:13:54,304
As it turns out this person Tori is a woman terpsichore Lindeman

2181
02:13:57,632 --> 02:14:00,192
Where is the great now

2182
02:14:00,704 --> 02:14:05,056
In 2018 she found herself under investigation by the North Dakota Attorney General

2183
02:14:05,568 --> 02:14:11,456
After a consumer protection division received a media inquiry about claims made by Chris Lindemann

2184
02:14:11,712 --> 02:14:17,856
Hyphenated

Magic City Christmas

2191

Which is required to solicit charitable donation

2192
02:14:40,640 --> 02:14:42,176
According to the attorney general's invest

2193
02:14:42,432 --> 02:14:48,320

2194
02:14:48,576 --> 02:14:49,344

2196
02:14:50,880 --> 02:14:52,928
The Bank of North Dakota and

2197
02:14:53,184 --> 02:14:53,952
In her solicitation

2198
02:14:54,720 --> 02:14:58,816
Without permission or even after being advised Bank of North Dakota

2199
02:14:59,072 --> 02:14:59,840
Could not be a sponsor

2200
02:15:00,096 --> 02:15:03,680
Wrestling in her websites

2201
02:15:03,936 --> 02:15:05,472
Magic City christmas.com

2202
02:15:08,800 --> 02:15:10,080
In her website and Facebook

2203
02:15:10,336 --> 02:15:13,408
Even after the city had repeatedly asked her to remove it

2204
02:15:13,920 --> 02:15:15,712
Brass Lindemann ignore

2205
02:15:15,968 --> 02:15:21,088
The contactor and as a result October 27th 2017

2206
02:15:21,344 --> 02:15:26,464
The issue a press release disclaiming any involvement with marasmus or a Magic City

2207
02:15:27,232 --> 02:15:33,376
Even after these concert was canceled for a Slenderman continue to sell items now claim

2208
02:15:33,632 --> 02:15:34,656
Proceeds

2209
02:15:34,912 --> 02:15:35,936
Denver homeless shelters

2210
02:15:36,704 --> 02:15:37,216
From what I can

2211
02:15:37,472 --> 02:15:39,520
Tell from the press release from the attorney general

2212
02:15:39,776 --> 02:15:41,312
It appears that Tori was

2213
02:15:43,616 --> 02:15:48,224
Investigation already has determined that morass Lindemann has engaged in prohibited

2214
02:15:48,480 --> 02:15:53,088
Questionable expenditures of donated funds received for a Magic City

2215
02:15:54,368 --> 02:16:00,512
Confirm the donations were deposited in October 2017 for purchases

2216
02:16:00,768 --> 02:16:02,560
QVC purchases

2217
02:16:03,072 --> 02:16:07,168
There is also evidence to suggest that when her personal bank account

2218
02:16:07,424 --> 02:16:10,752
Brass Lindemann made personal expenditures from the donated funds

2219
02:16:11,776 --> 02:16:17,920
Shady stop 160 G2 takedown

2220
02:16:29,696 --> 02:16:34,560
And to use the slogan

2221
02:16:34,816 --> 02:16:37,632
According to the election results

2222
02:16:37,888 --> 02:16:39,424
She did not make it to the ballot

2223
02:16:39,936 --> 02:16:46,080
I'm not sure if we're being on the resident created

2224
02:16:48,384 --> 02:16:53,504
North Dakota

2225
02:16:55,296 --> 02:17:01,440
Jason is being started because it's not that this individual is a concern for the well-being of our city people that reside within it

2226
02:17:01,696 --> 02:17:02,208
Yes 104

2227
02:17:02,976 --> 02:17:09,120
Due to harassment

2228
02:17:09,376 --> 02:17:13,984
Lying about City officials in claiming several

2229
02:17:14,240 --> 02:17:15,520
Including flower

2230
02:17:15,776 --> 02:17:19,872
Well I'm number of concerned citizens would like to shut down before any more damage

2231
02:17:20,128 --> 02:17:20,896
Can possibly be done

2232
02:17:23,200 --> 02:17:29,344
Several of us concerned citizens have contacted

2233
02:17:29,600 --> 02:17:31,904
Such things as

2234
02:17:32,160 --> 02:17:37,792
Personally attacked in such a pedophile

2235
02:17:38,560 --> 02:17:40,864
I've heard something like that

2236
02:17:41,120 --> 02:17:42,144
Hey

2237
02:17:42,656 --> 02:17:48,800
Sounds familiar.

2238

2239
02:17:52,896 --> 02:17:54,176
By myself little perplex

2240
02:17:55,200 --> 02:18:01,344
Princeton's in 2011 her name appears in the University of Kentucky's brochure

2241
02:18:02,112 --> 02:18:08,256
At the time she was an undergraduate biology she gave an oral presentation on

2242
02:18:08,512 --> 02:18:10,816
Acute spinal cord injury

2243
02:18:11,072 --> 02:18:12,608
Alright that sounds like b*******

2244
02:18:13,120 --> 02:18:18,496
Undergraduate research

2245
02:18:18,752 --> 02:18:21,568
What threw me for a loop that was her medium

2247
02:18:22,592 --> 02:18:23,872

2249
02:18:27,712 --> 02:18:32,064
And it's really actually

2250
02:18:32,576 --> 02:18:35,904
Her first essay was titled USA language confidential

2251
02:18:36,160 --> 02:18:37,696
A nation built by immigrants

2252
02:18:38,464 --> 02:18:44,608

Nationalist sentiments

2256
02:18:57,664 --> 02:19:00,224
United States of America was built by immigrants

2257
02:19:00,736 --> 02:19:02,272
Official language

2258
02:19:02,784 --> 02:19:06,112
Keep that in mind next time you think of blurting out this is America

2259
02:19:06,368 --> 02:19:08,160
With a redneck EX

2260
02:19:09,184 --> 02:19:09,696

2261

2014 clandestine

2265
02:19:24,032 --> 02:19:26,592
Should have been people involved in all that by this point

02:19:27,104 --> 02:19:31,200
Passport

2267
02:19:31,456 --> 02:19:33,504

02:19:34,016 --> 02:19:34,784
She says quote

2269
02:19:36,576 --> 02:19:39,136
2000

2270
02:19:39,392 --> 02:19:42,208
She's talking

2271
02:19:42,464 --> 02:19:45,024
2008 and I'm looking for work to help

2272
02:19:45,280 --> 02:19:46,304
Wework my way

2273
02:19:46,560 --> 02:19:47,072
Through Medical

2274
02:19:47,328 --> 02:19:49,888
School for a remote interpreter

2275
02:19:51,168 --> 02:19:52,704
So much of this doesn't make sense

2276
02:19:52,960 --> 02:19:56,544
In 2000

2277
02:19:56,800 --> 02:19:57,568
Super John

2278
02:19:57,824 --> 02:19:59,104
Passport hacks

2279
02:19:59,360 --> 02:20:04,736
Also she was a biology undergraduate in 2011 University of Kentucky

2280
02:20:04,992 --> 02:20:05,760
2008

2281
02:20:06,016 --> 02:20:12,160
Maybe she meant pre-2008

2282
02:20:12,416 --> 02:20:17,280
Sure.

2283
02:20:20,096 --> 02:20:24,960
Scrub your page man

2284
02:20:25,216 --> 02:20:27,776
Her next to post on the same topic

2285
02:20:28,032 --> 02:20:30,848
Interpreters and their importance in the medical field

2286
02:20:31,616 --> 02:20:36,224
You make some decent points about the difficulties that are involved

2287
02:20:36,480 --> 02:20:37,248
Types of language

2288
02:20:37,504 --> 02:20:43,648
Appropriate language

2289
02:20:44,160 --> 02:20:44,672
Persons

2290
02:20:45,440 --> 02:20:48,256
August 2016 the entire Township

2291
02:20:49,024 --> 02:20:55,168
Previously the extent of the politics on here in a writing had to do with issues like language interpreters and her feelings about Greece's fight

2292
02:20:55,424 --> 02:20:59,264
Situation speaking as someone Recovery Care

2293
02:20:59,520 --> 02:21:03,360
On August 1st 2016 to posted an entry titled

2294
02:21:03,616 --> 02:21:04,896
There are only two options

2295
02:21:05,152 --> 02:21:05,920
You have to choose

2296
02:21:06,944 --> 02:21:10,528
This is a completely different writing style the comes off like an unhinged

2297
02:21:10,784 --> 02:21:12,320
Rant against Hillary Clinton

2298
02:21:12,576 --> 02:21:14,112
Whereas the previous post where

2299
02:21:16,928 --> 02:21:19,744
Accusations of things like Webster

2300
02:21:20,000 --> 02:21:22,048
Kabul secretly being Chelsea Clinton

2301
02:21:22,304 --> 02:21:22,816
Bother

2302
02:21:23,072 --> 02:21:27,936
Brother Larry

2303
02:21:31,264 --> 02:21:37,408
In the suggestion of inside knowledge

2304
02:21:40,480 --> 02:21:42,528
Another thing that's interesting about this post

2305
02:21:42,784 --> 02:21:44,064
Better use of language

2306
02:21:44,320 --> 02:21:45,088
Completely changed

2307
02:21:45,856 --> 02:21:52,000
Please remember that

2308
02:21:52,512 --> 02:21:55,072
By protecting emigrate

2309
02:21:56,096 --> 02:21:59,424
Terminology like a lesser English proficient

2310
02:21:59,680 --> 02:22:01,728
People speak a different primary language

2311
02:22:01,984 --> 02:22:03,008
Butcher now

2312
02:22:03,264 --> 02:22:03,776
In August

2313
02:22:04,800 --> 02:22:10,944
Is really difficult to hide a poppy Plantation to make heroin in the United States

2314
02:22:11,200 --> 02:22:12,224
From Canada and Mexico

2315
02:22:15,808 --> 02:22:19,648
Also it will help regulate immigration

2316
02:22:20,160 --> 02:22:24,768
I don't see why everyone has a problem with defining borders and ensuring know who's coming into our country

2317
02:22:25,280 --> 02:22:27,328
You have a fence around your house and how loud Your Land

2318
02:22:27,584 --> 02:22:32,192
You have a door to your house to control who comes the country

2319
02:22:32,704 --> 02:22:37,824
Is it a ploy by Trump's opponent to Pander to the Latino or shall I say Taco community

2320
02:22:38,336 --> 02:22:41,920
Yes taco bowl is how the Democrat the DNC refers to Latinos

2321
02:22:42,432 --> 02:22:44,992
Second-class citizens in their eyes that deserve no respect

2322
02:22:45,248 --> 02:22:50,624
Did Mexico pay for the wall

2323
02:22:50,880 --> 02:22:51,648
It's that simple

2324
02:22:52,160 --> 02:22:53,952
Okay so did it so either

2325
02:22:54,208 --> 02:22:54,976
She got

2326
02:22:55,488 --> 02:22:56,512
YouTube

2327
02:22:56,768 --> 02:22:59,328
And went down the algorithm and lost your mind

2328
02:23:00,352 --> 02:23:01,120
Or

2329
02:23:01,632 --> 02:23:06,496
She has all of her scam started failing so she would like

2330
02:23:07,008 --> 02:23:09,056
I'm clever enough to right-wing Griff

2331
02:23:10,080 --> 02:23:10,592
No

2332
02:23:10,848 --> 02:23:16,736
Yeah I'm not I'm not asking you I'm saying that these are the possibilities

2333
02:23:16,992 --> 02:23:19,296
It really shows

2334
02:23:30,816 --> 02:23:31,328
Apri log

2335
02:23:31,584 --> 02:23:37,728
Some of that

2336
02:23:38,240 --> 02:23:40,032
Trail and make of it what you will

2337
02:23:40,288 --> 02:23:40,800
Wild

2338
02:23:41,056 --> 02:23:45,152
This post is totally very different from her early writing which I find very suspicious

2339
02:23:45,920 --> 02:23:48,480
It's also divorced

2340
02:23:48,736 --> 02:23:49,504
She previously approached

2341
02:23:49,760 --> 02:23:50,784
The issue of medical

2342
02:23:51,552 --> 02:23:52,576
Renounce

2343
02:23:52,832 --> 02:23:57,952
Completely nonsensical

2344
02:23:58,208 --> 02:23:59,488
Papi from flooding in

2345
02:23:59,744 --> 02:24:01,024
From Mexico and Canada

2346
02:24:01,280 --> 02:24:01,792
The trick

2347
02:24:09,728 --> 02:24:10,496
Her previous post

2348
02:24:10,752 --> 02:24:12,032
Contained empathy towards

2349
02:24:12,288 --> 02:24:13,824
Two Face unique challenges

2350
02:24:14,336 --> 02:24:16,384
Now she's ranting about stuff like this

2351
02:24:16,640 --> 02:24:18,176
No

2352
02:24:18,432 --> 02:24:20,480
Capital no discussion on this

2353
02:24:20,736 --> 02:24:25,088
Shut our borders down completely kick out all the illegal alien

2354
02:24:25,344 --> 02:24:29,696
Keyword illegal meaning not legal under law breaking the law

2355
02:24:29,952 --> 02:24:32,768
How hard is the word illegal for someone to understand

2356
02:24:34,816 --> 02:24:40,960
Even though she probably

2357
02:24:41,216 --> 02:24:41,984
Complete range

2358
02:24:42,240 --> 02:24:42,752
Perspective

2359
02:24:43,008 --> 02:24:48,128
It's ugly it's mean required

2360
02:24:48,640 --> 02:24:49,152
Which I guess

2361
02:24:50,176 --> 02:24:52,480
I don't know

2362
02:24:52,736 --> 02:24:53,504
Okay

2363
02:24:54,016 --> 02:24:54,784
Dan Dan

2364
02:24:57,344 --> 02:24:58,112
August 4th

2365
02:24:58,624 --> 02:24:59,392
August 1st August

2366
02:25:00,672 --> 02:25:02,720
And then in 2017

2367
02:25:02,976 --> 02:25:05,536
She scammed people out of money

2368
02:25:05,792 --> 02:25:11,936
With an illegal charity

2369
02:25:12,192 --> 02:25:12,960
Dan

2370
02:25:13,728 --> 02:25:17,312
In the lead-up to the election to all sorts of conspiracy Yarns about Trump

2371
02:25:17,824 --> 02:25:20,128
In one post she says quote your vote counts

2372
02:25:20,384 --> 02:25:23,200
Remember we're voting dead people legal immigrants

2373
02:25:23,456 --> 02:25:25,248
Illegal immigrants and fictional people

2374
02:25:25,760 --> 02:25:29,088
We descended into that frame yeah

2375
02:25:29,600 --> 02:25:34,720
On November 7th 2017 she posted an entry titled year later

2376
02:25:35,488 --> 02:25:38,560
And this install but you've ears into religious ideology about Trump

2377
02:25:39,072 --> 02:25:44,448
Today Franklin Graham together and pray for our present

2378
02:25:44,960 --> 02:25:47,776
I firmly believe that he was elected because people pray

2379
02:25:48,288 --> 02:25:50,080
I don't care if you think prayers don't work

2380
02:25:50,592 --> 02:25:51,104
Eminem

2381
02:25:54,432 --> 02:25:55,456
Just posted

2382
02:25:55,712 --> 02:25:58,016
So then you do care

2383
02:25:58,272 --> 02:25:59,552
Caps are weird

2384
02:26:06,208 --> 02:26:06,720
Is all about

2385
02:26:06,976 --> 02:26:12,352
Impossible for an individual

2386
02:26:13,888 --> 02:26:17,984
Also in this post I think Tori is advocating for businesses to pay higher taxes

2387
02:26:18,752 --> 02:26:21,824
Businesses big or small must listen to their communities

2388
02:26:22,080 --> 02:26:24,640
He must take a position and putting their community's first

2389
02:26:25,152 --> 02:26:27,456
You can't ride the crest of the bugaboos without

2390
02:26:27,712 --> 02:26:29,504
The boogie board which is your contribution

2391
02:26:30,016 --> 02:26:36,160
Seems like I should be the most effective way to distribute

2392
02:26:36,672 --> 02:26:38,208
But maybe we should

2393
02:26:39,232 --> 02:26:41,280
What's missing from

2394
02:26:41,536 --> 02:26:42,304
Previous writing

2395
02:26:42,560 --> 02:26:45,376
Is any indication of her life path working in secret intelligence

2396
02:26:45,632 --> 02:26:46,144
Contract

2397
02:26:46,656 --> 02:26:49,472
Around the time when she's supposed

2398
02:26:49,728 --> 02:26:50,496
University of

2399
02:26:50,752 --> 02:26:51,264
Kentucky

2400
02:26:53,056 --> 02:26:58,688
Complaining

2401
02:26:58,944 --> 02:27:05,088
Not even the suggestion she has first-hand experience

2402
02:27:05,600 --> 02:27:06,624
I had to guess I would say

2403
02:27:07,136 --> 02:27:09,440
Probably cuz that stuff wasn't part of her narrative yet

2404
02:27:09,696 --> 02:27:10,208
Yeah

2405
02:27:12,256 --> 02:27:14,304
To be the writings of

2406
02:27:14,560 --> 02:27:15,584
Two different people

2407
02:27:16,096 --> 02:27:18,912
But neither of them claimed the backstory the Tory now

2408
02:27:19,936 --> 02:27:22,496
The first person you season educated person who cares passion

2409
02:27:22,752 --> 02:27:25,312
Immigrants receive inappropriately

2410
02:27:25,824 --> 02:27:28,128
The second is of Raven conspiracy Limited

2411
02:27:29,152 --> 02:27:32,992
There's probably a cautionary Tale

2412
02:27:33,248 --> 02:27:37,344
Lesson Port than the fact that her own writing seems to directly contradict

2413
02:27:37,600 --> 02:27:40,160
And definitely does not support her current claim

2414
02:27:40,928 --> 02:27:46,048
Billy didn't literally none of the work that is involved in looking into her sources before repeating their claims

2415
02:27:46,304 --> 02:27:48,864
Those about the Kentucky election

2416
02:27:50,144 --> 02:27:50,912
Care about our work

2417
02:27:51,168 --> 02:27:52,448
He's very bad at this stuff

2418
02:27:53,984 --> 02:27:56,032
She's even trying to obscure the fact

2419
02:27:56,288 --> 02:28:00,896
Tori also the person

2420
02:28:01,152 --> 02:28:02,432
That she based her story about the

2421
02:28:02,688 --> 02:28:03,456
Kentucky elections on

2422
02:28:04,224 --> 02:28:07,296
Because she knows that that's bad she's yeah

2423
02:28:11,392 --> 02:28:12,416
Wow

2424
02:28:13,696 --> 02:28:15,744
Complicated

2425
02:28:16,000 --> 02:28:17,024
Sort of

2426
02:28:17,280 --> 02:28:18,048
View that I guess

2427
02:28:18,304 --> 02:28:19,328
Looking at

2428
02:28:20,864 --> 02:28:21,632
Find about her

2429
02:28:22,400 --> 02:28:23,424
It's it's

2430
02:28:23,680 --> 02:28:25,472
It's tough because you know you're

2431
02:28:25,984 --> 02:28:28,288
Emotionally your instinct is to think

2432
02:28:29,824 --> 02:28:32,384
She's got f***** up by this information

2433
02:28:32,640 --> 02:28:38,784
Stream

2434
02:28:39,040 --> 02:28:39,808
Down

2435
02:28:40,064 --> 02:28:40,832
Terrible

2436
02:28:41,088 --> 02:28:45,952
That's certainly a possibility I don't know like that

2437
02:28:46,208 --> 02:28:48,512
Possibility

2438
02:28:48,768 --> 02:28:51,072
I also probably

2439
02:28:51,584 --> 02:28:54,144
But desire on our parts to have like an empathic

2440
02:28:54,912 --> 02:29:00,032
Reasonable explanation for whatever

2441
02:29:01,568 --> 02:29:02,848
Medium bloggers

2442
02:29:03,616 --> 02:29:05,920
Upsetting

2443
02:29:07,200 --> 02:29:07,712
At her

2444
02:29:08,992 --> 02:29:09,504
Right now

2445
02:29:09,760 --> 02:29:12,576
Not for all of the line when she's doing the documentary

2446
02:29:12,832 --> 02:29:18,976
But that she in the same way Billy doesn't have the

2447
02:29:19,232 --> 02:29:20,000
Or is just

2448
02:29:20,256 --> 02:29:21,280
Too lazy to do

2449
02:29:21,536 --> 02:29:25,120
The barest minimum of Journalism

2450
02:29:25,376 --> 02:29:29,728
Too lazy to do the barest minimum of scrubbing your internet history

2451
02:29:29,984 --> 02:29:30,752
Before you start

2452
02:29:31,008 --> 02:29:32,032
To become the source

2453
02:29:32,544 --> 02:29:33,056
Conspiracy theory

2454
02:29:33,824 --> 02:29:34,592
You know

2455
02:29:34,848 --> 02:29:35,872
But if it's basic

2456
02:29:36,128 --> 02:29:37,152
What's basic stuff

2457
02:29:37,408 --> 02:29:39,712
If you're going to create a mythology for yourself

2458
02:29:40,736 --> 02:29:41,248
Do it

2459
02:29:46,368 --> 02:29:48,672
I don't know

2460
02:29:48,928 --> 02:29:49,440
Into the past

2461
02:29:52,768 --> 02:29:54,048
Whatever

2462
02:29:59,168 --> 02:29:59,680
It's weird

2463
02:30:00,192 --> 02:30:01,216
Sloppy

2464
02:30:03,264 --> 02:30:09,152
100% not believe any of this

2465
02:30:09,408 --> 02:30:15,040
2008 you're in med school and you're trying to

2466
02:30:15,296 --> 02:30:18,880
Work as a language interpreter

2467
02:30:19,648 --> 02:30:23,744
Find it hard to believe that the University of Kentucky

2468
02:30:30,400 --> 02:30:32,192
Orange Virginia

2469
02:30:32,960 --> 02:30:35,520
Also I don't know

2470
02:30:37,056 --> 02:30:37,824
Change.org

2471
02:30:38,080 --> 02:30:44,224
Petition that was making a claim Is Stolen Valor and I don't know

2472
02:30:46,784 --> 02:30:47,296
There's a

2473
02:30:47,552 --> 02:30:48,832
Play

2474
02:30:49,088 --> 02:30:49,856
Where people can post

2475
02:30:50,368 --> 02:30:52,416
The times that they were in the service

2476
02:30:52,672 --> 02:30:58,816
And then try and find and connect with people that they serve

2477
02:30:59,072 --> 02:31:00,608
How much is that information is cell

2478
02:31:00,864 --> 02:31:03,680
Generated where I don't know

2479
02:31:03,936 --> 02:31:05,216
I did use that

2480
02:31:05,728 --> 02:31:07,008
2 cross reference

2481
02:31:07,264 --> 02:31:10,592
University of Kentucky

2482
02:31:10,848 --> 02:31:12,128
Is on her military

2483
02:31:12,384 --> 02:31:12,896
Meetup

2484
02:31:19,808 --> 02:31:23,904
How's thorough an in-depth your destruction of every part of her life is

2485
02:31:27,488 --> 02:31:30,560
I feel bad if

2486
02:31:31,072 --> 02:31:33,632
Like genesis

2487
02:31:34,400 --> 02:31:36,448
Like sincerely

2488
02:31:36,704 --> 02:31:37,472
And it is

2489
02:31:37,984 --> 02:31:38,752
Somebody who got

2490
02:31:42,080 --> 02:31:45,664
How much of that is misplaced

2491
02:31:45,920 --> 02:31:52,064
According to the North Dakota attorney general actively scamming charity

2492
02:31:52,320 --> 02:31:56,160
Being the centerpiece of bulshit propaganda documentaries

2493
02:31:56,672 --> 02:31:59,232
Yeah

2494
02:32:01,536 --> 02:32:07,680
It stopped and I think maybe some of the empathy is based on like me thinking that you

2495
02:32:07,936 --> 02:32:11,264
Early

2496
02:32:11,520 --> 02:32:12,032
You know you don't

2497
02:32:12,288 --> 02:32:15,616
Consider all that much it's not stuff

2498
02:32:15,872 --> 02:32:17,920
The needs that like people who

2499
02:32:18,176 --> 02:32:18,944
Google or not

2500
02:32:19,200 --> 02:32:20,224
Proficient

2501
02:32:20,480 --> 02:32:22,528
In specialized situation

2502
02:32:22,784 --> 02:32:26,368
Conversation

2503
02:32:26,880 --> 02:32:32,000
You know I don't know exactly how much attention

2504
02:32:32,256 --> 02:32:34,304
Yeah I know it's hard it's

2505
02:32:35,072 --> 02:32:35,840
It's always hard

2506
02:32:36,352 --> 02:32:37,376
I think regardless of

2507
02:32:37,632 --> 02:32:39,424
Any situation to see somebody

2508
02:32:39,680 --> 02:32:40,192
West

2509
02:32:40,448 --> 02:32:40,960
Very clear

2510
02:32:41,216 --> 02:32:42,240
Potential

2511
02:32:42,496 --> 02:32:43,520
2 South Emerald

2512
02:32:44,032 --> 02:32:50,176
No looking for you I would have a lot more empathy for Millie if I looked into her and I found in the past that she had

2513
02:32:50,432 --> 02:32:53,760
Crusaders

2514
02:32:54,016 --> 02:32:59,648
Yeah you know where

2515
02:32:59,904 --> 02:33:06,048
I am there but for the grace of God because I empathize with the earlier version of her

2516
02:33:06,304 --> 02:33:08,352
Possible for me to turn into the later version

2517
02:33:08,608 --> 02:33:10,912
Snapper I suppose

2518
02:33:11,168 --> 02:33:17,312
Soto's like kind of selfish

2519
02:33:24,480 --> 02:33:30,368
Get to talk in here this is just like about Robert store

2520
02:33:31,136 --> 02:33:32,928
Oh I Izzy

2521
02:33:33,184 --> 02:33:35,744
Is the Inspector General of the NSA

2522
02:33:36,000 --> 02:33:40,864
Millie makes a false claim because

2523
02:33:41,120 --> 02:33:43,168
Should a f****** attitude out that other documentary

2524
02:33:43,680 --> 02:33:44,192
Obama

2525
02:33:44,704 --> 02:33:45,216
Robert

2526
02:33:47,264 --> 02:33:48,032
Deputy IG

2527
02:33:51,360 --> 02:33:51,872
Time

2528
02:33:52,128 --> 02:33:53,152
Store

2529
02:33:58,016 --> 02:33:58,528
During the trash

2530
02:33:59,296 --> 02:33:59,808
.

2531
02:34:00,064 --> 02:34:00,832
From the Obama

2532
02:34:01,088 --> 02:34:01,600
Ministration

2533
02:34:03,136 --> 02:34:03,648
Ministration

2534
02:34:04,416 --> 02:34:05,184
Stuart Pearce

2535
02:34:05,440 --> 02:34:05,952
You never have

2536
02:34:06,208 --> 02:34:06,720
Actually

2537
02:34:09,024 --> 02:34:09,536
Stration

2538
02:34:10,560 --> 02:34:11,584
How did the guy get

2539
02:34:11,840 --> 02:34:12,352
Confirm

2540
02:34:13,376 --> 02:34:15,168
Not one person asked

2541
02:34:22,080 --> 02:34:22,592
Nobody asked

2542
02:34:23,104 --> 02:34:23,872
Did you by any chance

2543
02:34:25,152 --> 02:34:25,664
From the president

2544
02:34:28,736 --> 02:34:29,760
It was all over the media

2545
02:34:31,808 --> 02:34:32,320
You're welcome

2546
02:34:32,576 --> 02:34:33,088
Set it up

2547
02:34:33,344 --> 02:34:34,112
Bill Taylor

2548
02:34:45,888 --> 02:34:47,424
That is odd

2549
02:34:47,680 --> 02:34:49,216
You should have added to that out

2550
02:34:50,752 --> 02:34:56,896
She's talking about overheard phone calls

2551
02:34:59,200 --> 02:35:03,040
The delivery makes it sound like she actually saying that she has supersonic hearing

2552
02:35:03,552 --> 02:35:05,600
And

2553
02:35:06,368 --> 02:35:06,880
That would be

2554
02:35:07,392 --> 02:35:08,160
Also

2555
02:35:08,416 --> 02:35:10,208
Does Millie mean when she says

2556
02:35:10,464 --> 02:35:12,000
Storch appears to have never been

2557
02:35:12,256 --> 02:35:13,792
Confirm by the Trump Administration

2558
02:35:14,560 --> 02:35:19,936
A mean bear

2559
02:35:20,192 --> 02:35:20,960
Lizard

2560
02:35:21,216 --> 02:35:24,288
Appears to never have been confirmed

2561
02:35:24,544 --> 02:35:25,824
Nautica Nautica

2562
02:35:26,080 --> 02:35:29,408
Weasel

2563
02:35:29,920 --> 02:35:31,712
Do not have been

2564
02:35:33,760 --> 02:35:34,272
Okay

2565
02:35:34,784 --> 02:35:38,880
Deputy inspector-general beginning in March 2015

2566
02:35:39,392 --> 02:35:44,256
At the end

2567
02:35:45,280 --> 02:35:51,424
June 2017 Donald Trump

2568
02:35:51,680 --> 02:35:55,008
Do that you could have nominated somebody else but Trump renominated the dude

2569
02:35:55,520 --> 02:36:01,664
If you go to nsa.gov super easy to find a press release dated December 20th

2570
02:36:01,920 --> 02:36:07,552
Director of the National Security

2571
02:36:07,808 --> 02:36:09,856
The president's nomination of

2572
02:36:10,112 --> 02:36:12,672
Is the Inspector General for the National Security Agency

2573
02:36:13,440 --> 02:36:16,512
What does Milli mean never confirm

2574
02:36:16,768 --> 02:36:18,048
From what I can tell

2575
02:36:22,144 --> 02:36:28,288
Here's To Me

2576
02:36:28,544 --> 02:36:30,336
To you because you Google

2577
02:36:30,848 --> 02:36:34,432
However where I'm not to Google

2578
02:36:34,944 --> 02:36:37,760
It appears that he is not been considered because I don't

2579
02:36:38,016 --> 02:36:40,064
See it then up here

2580
02:36:54,144 --> 02:36:55,680
This is where just like all right

2581
02:36:57,216 --> 02:37:03,360
Do they not know anything about Cambridge analytica to the Cambridge analytica used what bulshit they're saying

2582
02:37:03,616 --> 02:37:04,896
The other team is using

2583
02:37:05,152 --> 02:37:06,176
To get trouble

2584
02:37:06,688 --> 02:37:07,200
Haha

2585
02:37:07,712 --> 02:37:11,040
You're going to love that God damn it I hate them

2586
02:37:11,552 --> 02:37:12,576
They were supposed to sway

2587
02:37:14,368 --> 02:37:15,136
Give up the goods

2588
02:37:17,952 --> 02:37:18,464
Why why

2589
02:37:21,024 --> 02:37:21,536
Atwood

2590
02:37:24,096 --> 02:37:24,608
But that doesn't make

2591
02:37:24,864 --> 02:37:25,376
Distance from

2592
02:37:25,888 --> 02:37:26,400
Know that Jen

2593
02:37:26,656 --> 02:37:27,168
Darryl Jones

2594
02:37:27,680 --> 02:37:28,704
Is a Democrat

2595
02:37:29,728 --> 02:37:30,240
Don't like

2596
02:37:33,056 --> 02:37:33,568
Well

2597
02:37:34,080 --> 02:37:34,592
Cassandra

2598
02:37:35,616 --> 02:37:36,128
Russia was right

2599
02:37:39,968 --> 02:37:41,504
If you're keeping track

2600
02:37:41,760 --> 02:37:43,296
This is what the narrative is now

2601
02:37:43,808 --> 02:37:47,904
Cambridge analytica

2602
02:37:54,816 --> 02:37:55,584
Trump campaign

2603
02:37:55,840 --> 02:37:56,608
2 attack

2604
02:37:56,864 --> 02:37:58,400
Trump 63

2605
02:37:58,912 --> 02:38:04,288
They surreptitiously use nefarious me later

2606
02:38:04,544 --> 02:38:07,360
They're able to blame

2607
02:38:07,616 --> 02:38:09,920
Achieve the goal of making Trump not president

2608
02:38:10,176 --> 02:38:11,712
What you would only be because there's

2609
02:38:11,968 --> 02:38:17,856
The urine balloon dream is not doing it right now.

2610
02:38:20,160 --> 02:38:22,976
This is a long walk

2611
02:38:26,048 --> 02:38:30,400
Yeah so can you damage an elliptical

2612
02:38:31,680 --> 02:38:35,008
Except

2613
02:38:35,264 --> 02:38:38,336
So they're not really the problem

2614
02:38:38,848 --> 02:38:44,480
It's that they're not doing the shapeshifter well I mean obviously the Shaving should in the problem the other guy was like

2615
02:38:44,736 --> 02:38:50,880
Yeah that's what I would do except

2616
02:38:51,136 --> 02:38:52,672
According to this document

2617
02:38:52,928 --> 02:38:53,952
But it was

2618
02:38:54,464 --> 02:38:56,000
The globalist or whoever

2619
02:38:56,256 --> 02:38:57,280
Stay attached

2620
02:38:58,816 --> 02:39:02,400
The Cambridge

2621
02:39:02,656 --> 02:39:04,704
To Trump

2622
02:39:04,960 --> 02:39:08,288
To help Trump win

2623
02:39:08,544 --> 02:39:09,824
I meant Trump will be impeached

2624
02:39:10,080 --> 02:39:11,872
President worth

2625
02:39:12,640 --> 02:39:13,920
I don't know

2626
02:39:14,944 --> 02:39:15,456
Hertz

2627
02:39:15,968 --> 02:39:17,760
The brain

2628
02:39:18,016 --> 02:39:21,856
That has zero one hundred percent of the time

2629
02:39:23,392 --> 02:39:23,904
While

2630
02:39:24,416 --> 02:39:26,208
This is worth it get one

2631
02:39:26,976 --> 02:39:29,792
Was used to frame Trump

2632
02:39:30,816 --> 02:39:33,120
In this universe

2633
02:39:33,376 --> 02:39:33,888
Now

2634
02:39:34,144 --> 02:39:37,472
Has some implications that are difficult to get around

2635
02:39:37,728 --> 02:39:38,240
Mycampus

2636
02:39:39,264 --> 02:39:39,776
Analytic

2637
02:39:41,568 --> 02:39:42,080
.

2638
02:39:42,336 --> 02:39:43,104
That Russia

2639
02:39:44,384 --> 02:39:44,896
Operation

2640
02:39:45,664 --> 02:39:46,176
Help Trump

2641
02:39:48,224 --> 02:39:48,736
Election

2642
02:39:49,248 --> 02:39:50,016
Stonemanor

2643
02:39:50,528 --> 02:39:51,040
Davis

2644
02:39:51,296 --> 02:39:52,064
McCain John

2645
02:39:55,136 --> 02:39:55,648
I'm doing this

2646
02:39:58,976 --> 02:39:59,488
Decade

2647
02:40:01,024 --> 02:40:01,536
Personal fan

2648
02:40:05,376 --> 02:40:05,888
Priority

2649
02:40:14,080 --> 02:40:14,592
And I asked

2650
02:40:16,896 --> 02:40:17,408
Are you in

2651
02:40:18,432 --> 02:40:18,944
Did you work with

2652
02:40:22,784 --> 02:40:23,296
Knowledge

2653
02:40:26,368 --> 02:40:26,880
I didn't ask

2654
02:40:33,536 --> 02:40:34,048
You know about it

2655
02:40:35,328 --> 02:40:35,840
Stone

2656
02:40:36,352 --> 02:40:36,864
Trump

2657
02:40:37,376 --> 02:40:37,888
Early on

2658
02:40:38,656 --> 02:40:39,168
Suggestion

2659
02:40:41,472 --> 02:40:41,984
Appliances

2660
02:40:44,032 --> 02:40:45,568
What the f*** is happening

2661
02:40:52,992 --> 02:40:55,040
Apparently

2662
02:40:55,296 --> 02:40:56,064
Rodger Stone

2663
02:40:57,344 --> 02:40:57,856
Not

2664
02:40:58,112 --> 02:41:00,160
Hero now or something

2665
02:41:00,928 --> 02:41:03,744
About the pattern

2666
02:41:04,000 --> 02:41:05,792
From paper

2667
02:41:06,048 --> 02:41:12,192
Suspect today when he said Rodger

2668
02:41:12,448 --> 02:41:14,496
Or something

2669
02:41:14,752 --> 02:41:16,800
And in the process

2670
02:41:17,056 --> 02:41:20,640
And Rodger said what

2671
02:41:29,088 --> 02:41:32,160
Conversation

2672
02:41:36,512 --> 02:41:41,632
Associate

2673
02:41:41,888 --> 02:41:45,216
Does that not raise the question of what he was doing it Infowars

2674
02:41:45,472 --> 02:41:48,032
That be the next question the next

2675
02:41:48,288 --> 02:41:48,800
Take

2676
02:41:49,056 --> 02:41:50,080
You're if you're

2677
02:41:50,848 --> 02:41:51,616
This is unacceptable

2678
02:41:52,128 --> 02:41:52,640
We

2679
02:41:52,896 --> 02:41:54,944
Have reach stone for comments

2680
02:41:55,200 --> 02:41:56,992
By which I mean I walked

2681
02:41:57,248 --> 02:41:58,016
Down the hallway

2682
02:41:59,552 --> 02:42:03,648
And asking buddy and he refused to be a part of this documentary probably because

2683
02:42:03,904 --> 02:42:04,672
It's too good

2684
02:42:15,424 --> 02:42:17,216
Rodger isn't the same as another one

2685
02:42:17,728 --> 02:42:19,520
And this one is more of a character

2686
02:42:19,776 --> 02:42:25,920
Marvel Universe

2687
02:42:26,176 --> 02:42:28,736
In this section Rogers

2688
02:42:29,248 --> 02:42:31,552
Maybe probably not though

2689
02:42:31,808 --> 02:42:34,368
Good beans

2690
02:42:37,952 --> 02:42:38,720
Attached

2691
02:42:38,976 --> 02:42:44,608
People like Rodger and Paul manafort to Trump campaign

2692
02:42:45,120 --> 02:42:45,632
Or something

2693
02:42:46,144 --> 02:42:52,288
Fort

2694
02:42:52,544 --> 02:42:58,688
Beginning of this episode it's real bad

2695
02:42:59,456 --> 02:43:00,224
Sure

2696
02:43:01,248 --> 02:43:01,760
Through

2697
02:43:02,784 --> 02:43:03,296
Paul manafort

2698
02:43:04,576 --> 02:43:05,344
Submitted

2699
02:43:05,600 --> 02:43:06,112
Proposal

2700
02:43:08,672 --> 02:43:09,184
Rejected

2701
02:43:10,208 --> 02:43:10,720
I love that man

2702
02:43:12,256 --> 02:43:12,768
Boating

2703
02:43:14,560 --> 02:43:15,072
He's giving me on

2704
02:43:17,120 --> 02:43:17,632
Do that

2705
02:43:18,144 --> 02:43:19,680
Rejected Trump campaign

2706
02:43:24,032 --> 02:43:25,056
Trump must have sensed

2707
02:43:25,312 --> 02:43:25,824
Set the offer

2708
02:43:26,592 --> 02:43:27,104
Operation

2709
02:43:27,616 --> 02:43:28,384
Was a honey

2710
02:43:28,640 --> 02:43:29,408
Trap to set

2711
02:43:30,432 --> 02:43:31,200
What do you think that

2712
02:43:31,712 --> 02:43:32,480
Reason

2713
02:43:33,248 --> 02:43:33,760
Airport

2714
02:43:36,832 --> 02:43:38,112
Attached

2715
02:43:38,880 --> 02:43:39,392
Because they were true

2716
02:43:41,184 --> 02:43:41,696
Yes

2717
02:43:42,208 --> 02:43:42,720
Because they say

2718
02:43:47,072 --> 02:43:47,584
Ford

2719
02:43:49,120 --> 02:43:49,888
Whether or not

2720
02:43:53,216 --> 02:43:53,728
Roll

2721
02:44:02,688 --> 02:44:08,832
The Trump surrounded himself

2722
02:44:11,136 --> 02:44:16,256
Perfect

2723
02:44:16,512 --> 02:44:18,560
Backup your machinations to the evil globalist

2724
02:44:19,072 --> 02:44:22,656
Globalist

2725
02:44:22,912 --> 02:44:29,056
Inauguration in early January 2017

2726
02:44:29,312 --> 02:44:33,664
And reportedly met with General

2727
02:44:33,920 --> 02:44:38,784
Did Jules email group

2728
02:44:42,624 --> 02:44:48,768
Yeah

2729
02:44:53,632 --> 02:44:57,728
Overtures from Trump World group in 2016

2730
02:44:58,240 --> 02:45:00,544
Both represented themselves as members of Trumps Inner Circle

2731
02:45:01,568 --> 02:45:02,848
I don't know but it kind of

2732
02:45:03,104 --> 02:45:03,872
Bismarck Annex

2733
02:45:05,664 --> 02:45:06,176
Being installed

2734
02:45:06,432 --> 02:45:07,712
In the campaign order frame Trump

2735
02:45:11,296 --> 02:45:11,808
Inside group

2736
02:45:15,392 --> 02:45:18,208
I was talking about it straight b*******

2737
02:45:18,720 --> 02:45:24,864
You know damn yesterday at the memorial

2738
02:45:25,120 --> 02:45:26,400
The pastor

2739
02:45:26,912 --> 02:45:29,984
Who is doing the the service gave a real long

2740
02:45:30,240 --> 02:45:31,520
Awful

2741
02:45:31,776 --> 02:45:33,824
For the wages of sin is death kind of

2742
02:45:34,336 --> 02:45:36,640
Bible reading

2743
02:45:36,896 --> 02:45:37,664
It's the whole thing

2744
02:45:38,688 --> 02:45:42,528
So I've been thinking about the Bible and my relation to it for a while

2745
02:45:42,784 --> 02:45:43,296
Since then

2746
02:45:43,552 --> 02:45:44,064
And

2747
02:45:44,320 --> 02:45:45,856
Listening to this documentary

2748
02:45:46,112 --> 02:45:47,136
I was thinking

2749
02:45:48,928 --> 02:45:50,720
If Millie were there

2750
02:45:52,000 --> 02:45:52,512
Don't think

2751
02:45:52,768 --> 02:45:56,352
Jesus would have said he who is without sin May cast the first stone

2752
02:45:56,608 --> 02:45:57,632
I think you would've been like

2753
02:45:58,912 --> 02:46:04,543
This time next time we're going to do the turn the other cheek thing next time

2754
02:46:04,799 --> 02:46:08,895
You presented an interesting thought experiment

2755
02:46:09,151 --> 02:46:10,431
I would say

2756
02:46:10,687 --> 02:46:14,527
That is for you listening to this

2757
02:46:15,807 --> 02:46:16,319
Please

2758
02:46:16,575 --> 02:46:20,159
Please pity make I walk at this multiple.

2759
02:46:20,415 --> 02:46:26,303
You made me just

2760
02:46:27,583 --> 02:46:30,399
I will cast aspersions

2761
02:46:30,655 --> 02:46:31,679
Really

2762
02:46:31,935 --> 02:46:35,007
Interesting question for Tori here and that is

2763
02:46:35,519 --> 02:46:36,031
Alright

2764
02:46:36,287 --> 02:46:39,359
If you're if these operations operations were

2765
02:46:39,615 --> 02:46:40,383
Supposed to

2766
02:46:40,639 --> 02:46:41,663
Ensnare Trump

2767
02:46:41,919 --> 02:46:43,967
Why didn't they just run one

2768
02:46:44,223 --> 02:46:46,527
To get Hillary elected

2769
02:46:46,783 --> 02:46:48,063
And this is a dumb

2770
02:46:48,319 --> 02:46:49,343
Dumb answer

2771
02:46:50,111 --> 02:46:51,391
So why wouldn't they just

2772
02:46:51,647 --> 02:46:52,159
Mister Edwards

2773
02:46:52,927 --> 02:46:53,695
Opera

2774
02:46:55,743 --> 02:46:57,023
Good question

2775
02:47:00,607 --> 02:47:01,887
Censoring shadowban

2776
02:47:03,935 --> 02:47:04,703
Mitchell

2777
02:47:06,751 --> 02:47:07,263
Kingbird's I mean

2778
02:47:07,775 --> 02:47:08,543
Where we saw the real

2779
02:47:10,847 --> 02:47:16,991
I don't understand why the psychological operators would be deployed

2780
02:47:17,247 --> 02:47:18,527
Operations for comp

2781
02:47:20,575 --> 02:47:21,087
Letgo

2782
02:47:21,343 --> 02:47:24,415
Tall

2783
02:47:24,671 --> 02:47:28,511
Had one of them apparently telling me

2784
02:47:29,023 --> 02:47:30,047
With a straight face

2785
02:47:30,559 --> 02:47:35,679
She got straight face that she is she smiling is this documentary like a joke

2786
02:47:35,935 --> 02:47:42,079
That if you only listen to auditorily talk

2787
02:47:45,663 --> 02:47:47,455
As the British say taking the piss

2788
02:47:47,967 --> 02:47:48,479
Explain to me

2789
02:47:48,991 --> 02:47:51,551
Are you would have government agencies

2790
02:47:52,831 --> 02:47:55,647
The same government agency contractors

2791
02:47:56,159 --> 02:47:58,975
Working simultaneously against each other

2792
02:47:59,487 --> 02:48:01,535
Well it's the same people

2793
02:48:01,791 --> 02:48:03,583
Working against themselves

2794
02:48:04,607 --> 02:48:05,631
4 tons

2795
02:48:06,143 --> 02:48:07,167
Clear goals

2796
02:48:07,679 --> 02:48:13,823
Operate this way outside of a comic book

2797
02:48:14,079 --> 02:48:15,103
Yeah but

2798
02:48:15,871 --> 02:48:18,431
Patricksburg he comes into clear it up a little bit

2799
02:48:18,687 --> 02:48:20,479
I need some clarification

2800
02:48:20,735 --> 02:48:23,551
He seems to think of

2801
02:48:23,807 --> 02:48:24,831
Pence elected

2802
02:48:25,599 --> 02:48:26,111
Basically

2803
02:48:27,135 --> 02:48:27,903
What would be the

2804
02:48:37,631 --> 02:48:38,143
Good question

2805
02:48:38,399 --> 02:48:38,911
Because

2806
02:48:39,423 --> 02:48:40,191
He wasn't their choice

2807
02:48:41,983 --> 02:48:42,495
Is a jackass

2808
02:48:43,263 --> 02:48:44,287
So we're talking about

2809
02:48:44,799 --> 02:48:45,311
Dying

2810
02:48:48,383 --> 02:48:49,151
Which pencil

2811
02:48:49,919 --> 02:48:50,687
John McCain

2812
02:48:52,991 --> 02:48:53,759
Lindsey Graham

2813
02:48:54,015 --> 02:48:54,527
Rather have

2814
02:48:55,295 --> 02:48:55,807
Lindsey Graham

2815
02:49:04,255 --> 02:49:04,767
Batman

2816
02:49:05,535 --> 02:49:10,911
We're totally irrational response to be mad at someone who gives out your cell phone on television

2817
02:49:11,679 --> 02:49:12,447
Yeah

2818
02:49:12,959 --> 02:49:14,751
Got that

2819
02:49:15,007 --> 02:49:18,335
Crazy I would say

2820
02:49:18,591 --> 02:49:19,359
Bass

2821
02:49:22,175 --> 02:49:27,039
Troll and nefarious dealings with are described

2822
02:49:27,807 --> 02:49:30,367
Simple solution would have been to run pants

2823
02:49:30,623 --> 02:49:35,231
And perform operations in order to support him winning the presidency

2824
02:49:35,487 --> 02:49:37,023
Or if you don't want pads

2825
02:49:37,791 --> 02:49:38,559
Grand KC

2826
02:49:39,327 --> 02:49:40,607
Run anybody

2827
02:49:41,375 --> 02:49:43,423
Having both ways

2828
02:49:43,935 --> 02:49:50,079
You can yes you can magical otherworldly control

2829
02:49:50,335 --> 02:49:54,943
Easy fix

2830
02:49:55,199 --> 02:49:56,735
So just chosen somebody else

2831
02:49:59,295 --> 02:50:03,391
More powerful than the iPad

2832
02:50:05,439 --> 02:50:08,255
Why didn't you do embed Cambridge analytica

2833
02:50:09,279 --> 02:50:12,351
Here's here's what this documentary accidentally proves

2834
02:50:13,887 --> 02:50:14,399
Trump

2835
02:50:15,679 --> 02:50:16,447
So

2836
02:50:17,727 --> 02:50:20,031
Everything he does

2837
02:50:20,543 --> 02:50:22,079
That in order to

2838
02:50:22,335 --> 02:50:24,895
At the very least make him appear

2839
02:50:25,151 --> 02:50:25,919
Competent

2840
02:50:26,175 --> 02:50:27,711
You have to go to Vizsla

2841
02:50:27,967 --> 02:50:32,319
Yes yes that is true that is what Trump is so people are

2842
02:50:32,575 --> 02:50:35,391
Killing their own brain trying to make him a good guy

2843
02:50:36,415 --> 02:50:36,927
Wow

2844
02:50:37,695 --> 02:50:38,719
Jamel

2845
02:50:38,975 --> 02:50:41,023
Get to the beginning

2846
02:50:42,303 --> 02:50:43,839
Some weird claims on Tori

2847
02:50:44,095 --> 02:50:44,607
Breeze Park

2848
02:50:44,863 --> 02:50:46,143
Don't say 3 hours in

2849
02:50:46,399 --> 02:50:47,167
Did we get to the beginning

2850
02:50:55,871 --> 02:50:59,455
Parts of the DNC server that got

2851
02:51:00,479 --> 02:51:00,991
Partisan

2852
02:51:01,503 --> 02:51:02,271
Still the same thing

2853
02:51:03,039 --> 02:51:03,807
They went with nothing

2854
02:51:07,391 --> 02:51:08,415
Females in song

2855
02:51:09,951 --> 02:51:10,975
When I had

2856
02:51:15,583 --> 02:51:17,119
Okay

2857
02:51:20,703 --> 02:51:22,751
Something all night which is not provider

2858
02:51:23,007 --> 02:51:24,287
I mean

2859
02:51:25,055 --> 02:51:25,823
You could even just

2860
02:51:26,079 --> 02:51:32,223
Take a picture of a random search better than just saying it

2861
02:51:32,479 --> 02:51:35,295
Cloud up

2862
02:51:35,551 --> 02:51:36,575
You can picture you can

2863
02:51:36,831 --> 02:51:38,111
Yeah

2864
02:51:38,623 --> 02:51:43,231
I don't I don't care for this I'm going to need more

2865
02:51:43,487 --> 02:51:43,999
Call Dan

2866
02:51:51,679 --> 02:51:52,191
Call me back

2867
02:51:53,727 --> 02:51:54,239
Told him about

2868
02:51:55,263 --> 02:51:55,775
I know why

2869
02:51:57,311 --> 02:51:57,823
Every one of these p

2870
02:52:00,639 --> 02:52:03,455
I have a hunch as to why people would not call you back

2871
02:52:03,711 --> 02:52:04,223
I wouldn't

2872
02:52:05,247 --> 02:52:05,759
There is

2873
02:52:06,015 --> 02:52:07,039
Sometimes

2874
02:52:09,087 --> 02:52:10,623
You know this goes beyond

2875
02:52:10,879 --> 02:52:11,903
A cigar is just

2876
02:52:12,159 --> 02:52:15,743
The cigar

2877
02:52:16,767 --> 02:52:17,535
I have a foot

2878
02:52:17,791 --> 02:52:23,167
Dealing with objects

2879
02:52:23,423 --> 02:52:25,215
Permanent

2880
02:52:25,471 --> 02:52:31,359
Not even the acknowledgement I hear this stuff about Bergie

2881
02:52:31,615 --> 02:52:33,151
Complaints about how people interact with

2882
02:52:33,919 --> 02:52:38,527
He seems to think he has the goods on everything and all of this

2883
02:52:38,783 --> 02:52:44,159
No one takes him seriously because he talks to them and they're like oh there's no credibility

2884
02:52:44,415 --> 02:52:47,743
Look into this for a minute now I got now. Doesn't check out

2885
02:52:48,255 --> 02:52:50,047
This is like me

2886
02:52:50,559 --> 02:52:54,399
Being like insisting that I have the best 3-point shot in the world

2887
02:52:54,655 --> 02:52:56,447
36 year old person

2888
02:52:56,703 --> 02:53:02,847
I keep going to talk to basketball teams in the NBA

2889
02:53:03,103 --> 02:53:09,247
And it's a conspiracy because they don't want me to take over the three-point

2890
02:53:09,503 --> 02:53:14,879
It wouldn't be good

2891
02:53:15,135 --> 02:53:19,231
You don't want me coming in there and Wrecking shop from downtown

2892
02:53:20,511 --> 02:53:23,071
Everytime I called like dude I called

2893
02:53:23,327 --> 02:53:25,119
Trucking

2894
02:53:25,375 --> 02:53:26,143
Utah Jazz

2895
02:53:26,399 --> 02:53:28,703
I called

2896
02:53:28,959 --> 02:53:30,495
Ages in the problem

2897
02:53:30,751 --> 02:53:32,799
Vince Carter played in till he's dead

2898
02:53:33,311 --> 02:53:36,895
Sounds that way to me okay

2899
02:53:37,407 --> 02:53:39,455
I did I get you

2900
02:53:39,711 --> 02:53:40,223
Because of

2901
02:53:40,479 --> 02:53:42,015
Turtles with twisting in your thinking

2902
02:53:42,271 --> 02:53:45,855
That's accurate

2903
02:53:46,111 --> 02:53:47,647
I'm seen

2904
02:53:49,183 --> 02:53:50,719
Have a 100%

2905
02:53:50,975 --> 02:53:57,119
Perception

2906
02:54:00,447 --> 02:54:04,799
And have you heard what some of these people say

2907
02:54:05,055 --> 02:54:08,383
Think that they're not there do inside

2908
02:54:08,639 --> 02:54:09,151
For you

2909
02:54:12,991 --> 02:54:15,807
I can't breathe very hard

2910
02:54:16,063 --> 02:54:18,367
Billy gets back to talking about

2911
02:54:18,623 --> 02:54:20,927
The DC passport

2912
02:54:23,743 --> 02:54:25,023
B I got some problems

2913
02:54:25,535 --> 02:54:26,303
Cgi's

2914
02:54:27,583 --> 02:54:28,351
The passport fee

2915
02:54:29,119 --> 02:54:29,631
2008

2916
02:54:30,143 --> 02:54:31,167
The CGI involved

2917
02:54:31,679 --> 02:54:32,703
The Mueller investigation

2918
02:54:33,727 --> 02:54:34,751
See how contract

2919
02:54:35,519 --> 02:54:36,031
Ability to

2920
02:54:36,543 --> 02:54:37,055
Perform

2921
02:54:37,311 --> 02:54:37,823
And

2922
02:54:38,079 --> 02:54:38,591
Clean up there

2923
02:54:40,127 --> 02:54:46,271
We already discussed this but in case you forgot CGI was not involved in the passport issue back in 2008 that was Stan Lee in court

2924
02:54:46,527 --> 02:54:48,831
Has acquired by CDI to years later

2925
02:54:49,343 --> 02:54:54,463
Billy is trying to make a big deal out of their fingerprints being in two places but it was one of those places she's misreporting

2926
02:54:54,975 --> 02:54:59,071
Specific lines are being made about TGI's intersection with the Mueller

2927
02:54:59,327 --> 02:54:59,839
Navigation

2928
02:55:00,095 --> 02:55:05,727
But considering 3rd insanely Diversified company to brings in an annual revenue of over ten billion dollars

2929
02:55:05,983 --> 02:55:09,055
I bet it's not outside

2930
02:55:09,567 --> 02:55:13,407
It or systems consulting or something or some subsidiaries

2931
02:55:13,919 --> 02:55:16,479
Let's Millie could be more specific about what they did and why it's

2932
02:55:16,735 --> 02:55:19,039
Suspicious I'm not going on a wild-goose chase

2933
02:55:19,551 --> 02:55:23,903
At this point I should probably say I'm not going on another wild-goose Chase cuz my dude

2934
02:55:24,159 --> 02:55:26,719
Marquis last 48 hours

2935
02:55:27,999 --> 02:55:29,279
Ziggy's

2936
02:55:34,655 --> 02:55:37,471
Had a piece of the DNC server

2937
02:55:37,727 --> 02:55:40,031
Talking about

2938
02:55:41,055 --> 02:55:45,663
That came to be I would like to know that

2939
02:55:50,271 --> 02:55:50,783
I need it now

2940
02:55:54,367 --> 02:55:54,879
Southridge

2941
02:55:57,439 --> 02:55:57,951
He was at

2942
02:56:01,279 --> 02:56:01,791
Hey when is

2943
02:56:02,047 --> 02:56:02,559
Google image

2944
02:56:04,351 --> 02:56:06,399
You there for us

2945
02:56:09,471 --> 02:56:09,983
Florida

2946
02:56:15,615 --> 02:56:16,639
Jermaine

2947
02:56:28,927 --> 02:56:29,439
Copies

2948
02:56:30,719 --> 02:56:31,231
Fractions

2949
02:56:33,791 --> 02:56:34,303
So

2950
02:56:36,351 --> 02:56:37,119
Ancestors

2951
02:56:38,399 --> 02:56:39,423
Volume

2952
02:56:40,959 --> 02:56:41,727
Okay

2953
02:56:43,007 --> 02:56:49,151
She was watching the upload

2954
02:56:49,407 --> 02:56:51,967
DNC server

2955
02:56:52,223 --> 02:56:56,575
I don't believe any of this

2956
02:56:56,831 --> 02:56:58,879
Some some

2957
02:56:59,135 --> 02:57:02,207
Older guy behind a big desk

2958
02:57:02,463 --> 02:57:03,231
Eaton

2959
02:57:03,487 --> 02:57:04,511
Eating a hoagie for lunch

2960
02:57:04,767 --> 02:57:06,047
And he just looked at me like

2961
02:57:06,303 --> 02:57:08,863
Why don't you go download some of that DNC stuff

2962
02:57:10,399 --> 02:57:13,983
I'll see you guys later across the country story

2963
02:57:14,239 --> 02:57:17,055
Hanging out talking String Theory with her friends

2964
02:57:19,615 --> 02:57:25,759
String theory

2965
02:57:26,527 --> 02:57:30,111
They don't we wrote

2966
02:57:37,023 --> 02:57:38,815
Accepting extravagant claims without proof

2967
02:57:39,327 --> 02:57:42,143
Also if I understand

2968
02:57:43,423 --> 02:57:49,567
June 2016 so we can put this on Tori's timeline as being after her

2969
02:57:50,079 --> 02:57:55,711
Sure I can just prior to her trying to rip off people with the fake charity

2970
02:57:55,967 --> 02:57:56,735
And I don't see

2971
02:57:56,991 --> 02:58:00,319
Such a thing

2972
02:58:00,575 --> 02:58:01,599
People like her

2973
02:58:02,367 --> 02:58:02,879
Super smart

2974
02:58:03,135 --> 02:58:05,695
Around discussing String Theory like

2975
02:58:06,207 --> 02:58:07,743
An Algonquin Round Table

2976
02:58:07,999 --> 02:58:10,047
You know like Dorothy Parker

2977
02:58:16,191 --> 02:58:19,007
Show me literally one thing

2978
02:58:22,335 --> 02:58:28,479
Feelings about that

2979
02:58:29,759 --> 02:58:30,783
And when he saw that

2980
02:58:31,039 --> 02:58:31,807
Retroactive

2981
02:58:33,343 --> 02:58:33,855
Separate

2982
02:58:34,879 --> 02:58:35,391
Stories in the

2983
02:58:37,183 --> 02:58:38,207
Bernie Sanders

2984
02:58:38,463 --> 02:58:38,975
Elections

2985
02:58:39,743 --> 02:58:40,255
Stolen

2986
02:58:41,023 --> 02:58:41,535
The DNC

2987
02:58:45,375 --> 02:58:45,887
Armagnac

2988
02:58:47,167 --> 02:58:47,935
He came and cons

2989
02:58:58,175 --> 02:58:58,687
Decided

2990
02:59:06,879 --> 02:59:07,647
Okay

2991
02:59:16,863 --> 02:59:17,375
Don

2992
02:59:17,887 --> 02:59:19,679
Killed on July 11th

2993
02:59:19,935 --> 02:59:20,703
2016

2994
02:59:20,959 --> 02:59:26,847
That's a lawsuit

2995
02:59:27,359 --> 02:59:31,455
Lucas had nothing to do with the actual process servers job was

2996
02:59:31,711 --> 02:59:32,735
Deliver papers

2997
02:59:32,991 --> 02:59:33,759
Deserve

2998
02:59:34,015 --> 02:59:38,623
For One Source process Incorporated company in DC

2999
02:59:39,135 --> 02:59:45,279
The video may have been celebrated by anti-clinton folks across the video wasn't involved in the actual

3000
02:59:45,535 --> 02:59:47,071
Much as they might have wanted to

3001
02:59:48,351 --> 02:59:51,935
On August 2nd Lucas passed away

3002
02:59:52,447 --> 02:59:55,519
This was naturally yet another Clinton murder case closed

3003
02:59:56,287 --> 03:00:02,431
In November the chief medical examiner Washington d.c. confirm that Lucas's death have been an accident and been the result of

3004
03:00:02,687 --> 03:00:04,223
Some drugs including Sentinel

3005
03:00:04,479 --> 03:00:05,247
Psycho Benz

3006
03:00:06,527 --> 03:00:08,319
Which is a muscle relaxer

3007
03:00:08,831 --> 03:00:11,135
Storytelling an intriguing Tale

3008
03:00:11,391 --> 03:00:12,159
It's kind of short on

3009
03:00:14,207 --> 03:00:14,719
Any of that

3010
03:00:14,975 --> 03:00:17,279
Summit entertainment

3011
03:00:27,519 --> 03:00:29,823
Boring annoying

3012
03:00:30,079 --> 03:00:31,615
You're not wrong about that

3013
03:00:32,639 --> 03:00:38,783
Trends that are just impossible to ignore like where it with Patrick Berg talk about how

3014
03:00:39,039 --> 03:00:45,183
Protests in Ferguson

3015
03:00:45,439 --> 03:00:47,487
Matter to Ukraine or something

3016
03:00:47,743 --> 03:00:52,095
Another accusation that he has about Ira operation

3017
03:00:52,607 --> 03:00:53,631
What you've seen

3018
03:00:54,655 --> 03:00:55,167
Riots

3019
03:00:55,679 --> 03:00:56,959
George Floyd's death

3020
03:00:57,983 --> 03:00:58,751
From your perspective

3021
03:00:59,007 --> 03:01:00,287
Does that look like

3022
03:01:06,943 --> 03:01:07,711
More stuff

3023
03:01:15,135 --> 03:01:20,511
Another social protest event is happening seeking to address issues that primarily affect non-white people and Patrick Bergin

3024
03:01:22,559 --> 03:01:23,327
Organic

3025
03:01:23,839 --> 03:01:28,191
Make sense got to be an elaborate plan to trick people into protesting

3026
03:01:29,215 --> 03:01:31,775
You notice that this kind of thinking doesn't get directed at certain

3027
03:01:32,031 --> 03:01:32,799
Other types of gas

3028
03:01:33,823 --> 03:01:36,127
Unite the right rally isn't being called IIA

3029
03:01:44,575 --> 03:01:46,111
Is social Gatherings and movements

3030
03:01:46,367 --> 03:01:48,927
Ideology

3031
03:01:49,183 --> 03:01:53,023
Because it makes sense that people will be motivated around something like that

3032
03:01:53,791 --> 03:01:59,935
Curry shoes that don't touch their lives personally

3033
03:02:00,447 --> 03:02:01,471
Contextualize those things

3034
03:02:01,727 --> 03:02:03,775
It's so silly

3035
03:02:04,031 --> 03:02:05,055
You're so stupid

3036
03:02:05,311 --> 03:02:06,079
For thinking that

3037
03:02:06,335 --> 03:02:06,847
A cop

3038
03:02:07,103 --> 03:02:08,639
Murdering a man

3039
03:02:08,895 --> 03:02:09,919
A black man

3040
03:02:10,175 --> 03:02:10,943
In Cold Blood

3041
03:02:12,991 --> 03:02:14,015
Isaiah

3042
03:02:14,271 --> 03:02:16,319
Yeah I'm tired

3043
03:02:20,927 --> 03:02:21,439
That's that I don't know

3044
03:02:22,207 --> 03:02:23,487
Probably IRA

3045
03:02:23,743 --> 03:02:26,303
But on the other hand if somebody might

3046
03:02:27,583 --> 03:02:28,607
Intimated that

3047
03:02:28,863 --> 03:02:30,399
Gun control is a good idea

3048
03:02:30,655 --> 03:02:31,679
Obviously

3049
03:02:49,343 --> 03:02:52,415
Disturbed me deeply

3050
03:02:54,719 --> 03:02:55,231
Quite literally

3051
03:02:56,767 --> 03:02:57,279
Movie still alive

3052
03:03:02,143 --> 03:03:02,655
Almost

3053
03:03:09,823 --> 03:03:10,847
I mean I guess that's the

3054
03:03:13,407 --> 03:03:13,919
If you actually

3055
03:03:15,455 --> 03:03:15,967
Was pointing out in

3056
03:03:20,575 --> 03:03:21,087
So

3057
03:03:21,599 --> 03:03:27,743
Will continue to for the foreseeable future

3058
03:03:31,583 --> 03:03:34,911
What's it called false Flags

3059
03:03:35,167 --> 03:03:36,703
Two more critical analysis

3060
03:03:36,959 --> 03:03:38,751
Sandy Hook

3061
03:03:39,263 --> 03:03:41,055
Really chew on

3062
03:03:41,311 --> 03:03:42,079
Add stop

3063
03:03:42,335 --> 03:03:42,847
About

3064
03:03:43,359 --> 03:03:46,943
I think what's more important is a terrifying it is the idea that

3065
03:03:47,199 --> 03:03:48,991
That Tori thinks the movies are making

3066
03:03:49,247 --> 03:03:49,759
In front of her

3067
03:03:53,855 --> 03:03:56,415
Programming

3068
03:03:57,695 --> 03:03:59,743
I don't know why but the framing of it is our making

3069
03:03:59,999 --> 03:04:01,279
Fun of us is like

3070
03:04:02,047 --> 03:04:03,583
A little sadder

3071
03:04:03,839 --> 03:04:07,423
Summer it's a little narcissistic to me

3072
03:04:09,471 --> 03:04:11,263
It makes me feel sad

3073
03:04:17,151 --> 03:04:22,783
About

3074
03:04:23,295 --> 03:04:25,855
6 years before the iammo

3075
03:04:26,111 --> 03:04:26,623
So

3076
03:04:27,903 --> 03:04:28,415
I don't know

3077
03:04:28,671 --> 03:04:29,183
Anyway who cares

3078
03:04:29,439 --> 03:04:34,815
None of that's important for it

3079
03:04:35,071 --> 03:04:38,143
Especially like you were talking about Alex

3080
03:04:40,191 --> 03:04:40,703
Has like

3081
03:04:41,727 --> 03:04:43,775
Alex's Volkswagen

3082
03:04:44,031 --> 03:04:44,543
Hold up

3083
03:04:44,799 --> 03:04:48,639
Your documentary

3084
03:04:54,527 --> 03:04:55,039
You know

3085
03:04:55,551 --> 03:04:56,575
Hacking reality

3086
03:04:59,647 --> 03:05:01,439
You'll see the reason that Millie

3087
03:05:02,975 --> 03:05:03,487
She thought

3088
03:05:03,743 --> 03:05:04,511
But you was being arrested

3089
03:05:05,023 --> 03:05:07,839
Documentary

3090
03:05:08,351 --> 03:05:10,143
She should never get in that car

3091
03:05:10,399 --> 03:05:15,519
If she had the opportunity to flee out the back of the house

3092
03:05:27,039 --> 03:05:27,551
Oaxaca

3093
03:05:33,183 --> 03:05:33,695
It's just

3094
03:05:33,951 --> 03:05:34,463
Software

3095
03:05:41,375 --> 03:05:41,887
Chorus

3096
03:05:48,543 --> 03:05:49,055
Schoology

3097
03:05:49,823 --> 03:05:50,335
All of them

3098
03:05:53,663 --> 03:05:56,735
Pick from all the people that will give you a guilty verdict

3099
03:05:57,759 --> 03:05:59,295
So there's no chance.

3100
03:05:59,551 --> 03:06:01,343
Anybody

3101
03:06:03,135 --> 03:06:04,159
Judges are corrupt.

3102
03:06:04,415 --> 03:06:04,927
The major

3103
03:06:05,183 --> 03:06:05,695
Your problem

3104
03:06:06,207 --> 03:06:06,719
For the justices

3105
03:06:07,487 --> 03:06:08,255
People are able to

3106
03:06:08,511 --> 03:06:09,023
Use that take

3107
03:06:10,303 --> 03:06:10,815
Selection

3108
03:06:12,351 --> 03:06:12,863
Predict

3109
03:06:13,119 --> 03:06:13,631
Who's going to

3110
03:06:14,655 --> 03:06:15,167
Throw their vote

3111
03:06:17,727 --> 03:06:18,239
Is anyone stopping

3112
03:06:20,287 --> 03:06:21,055
What's a major problem

3113
03:06:24,383 --> 03:06:24,895
Whilst

3114
03:06:27,967 --> 03:06:31,551
Rodger stone that I'm not sure if

3115
03:06:36,415 --> 03:06:37,695
Best

3116
03:06:37,951 --> 03:06:38,719
That's just insane

3117
03:06:38,975 --> 03:06:41,791
Ecology in order to

3118
03:06:42,047 --> 03:06:46,399
Jury pool

3119
03:06:46,655 --> 03:06:51,519
So basically all the underpinnings of every piece of our society are just

3120
03:06:52,287 --> 03:06:53,311
Under control

3121
03:06:56,127 --> 03:06:57,151
Possibly

3122
03:06:57,407 --> 03:06:57,919
To go

3123
03:06:58,175 --> 03:07:03,039
And get a trial for whatever these charges are

3124
03:07:05,599 --> 03:07:08,159
Even even get there

3125
03:07:11,231 --> 03:07:14,559
Every legal decision ever

3126
03:07:14,815 --> 03:07:16,607
Is up for grabs and probably

3127
03:07:16,863 --> 03:07:18,143
F****** fake to begin

3128
03:07:18,655 --> 03:07:19,679
Nothing's real

3129
03:07:19,935 --> 03:07:22,239
Magic show

3130
03:07:22,751 --> 03:07:27,359
I feel like she's making fun of me

3131
03:07:27,615 --> 03:07:30,431
Bikewagon the dog

3132
03:07:30,943 --> 03:07:34,527
Do deer Tori says something it's just absolutely not true about Trump

3133
03:07:35,295 --> 03:07:36,063
People new

3134
03:07:36,575 --> 03:07:37,599
Just how bad it is

3135
03:07:38,367 --> 03:07:39,135
Think about how

3136
03:07:42,207 --> 03:07:42,719
Think of all the money there

3137
03:07:45,023 --> 03:07:45,791
Stop the clearance

3138
03:07:46,047 --> 03:07:46,815
Never once you're out

3139
03:07:48,863 --> 03:07:50,143
Remember

3140
03:07:50,399 --> 03:07:51,167
Future General

3141
03:07:51,679 --> 03:07:52,703
Or all the future

3142
03:07:53,215 --> 03:07:53,727
Intelligent

3143
03:07:55,263 --> 03:07:56,031
Don't get to use your cleaner

3144
03:07:57,567 --> 03:07:59,615
Absolutely not true

3145
03:07:59,871 --> 03:08:04,479
What Trump did was a politically-motivated attack and pressed against political opponents

3146
03:08:04,735 --> 03:08:10,879
In August 2018 Trump revoke security clearance for John Brennan

3147
03:08:11,135 --> 03:08:13,183
Various people have been critical of his administration

3148
03:08:13,439 --> 03:08:15,743
Ettore in action

3149
03:08:16,511 --> 03:08:17,535
In nature

3150
03:08:17,791 --> 03:08:23,423
Historian

3151
03:08:23,935 --> 03:08:24,447
Is complete fiction

3152
03:08:24,959 --> 03:08:28,799
If it's not

3153
03:08:29,823 --> 03:08:31,871
What are the issues here is a misunderstanding of what

3154
03:08:32,127 --> 03:08:32,895
Security clearance

3155
03:08:33,151 --> 03:08:33,663
When is

3156
03:08:34,175 --> 03:08:39,295
If you have top-secret clearance that doesn't just mean that you're able to access whatever top-secret material you want

3157
03:08:39,807 --> 03:08:43,903
You would still need to be employed in a job where access to that material is required

3158
03:08:44,415 --> 03:08:49,279
Having security clearance is essential

3159
03:08:49,535 --> 03:08:51,839
Access to certain levels of classified material

3160
03:08:52,351 --> 03:08:55,167
Pre-approval TSA

3161
03:08:55,423 --> 03:08:58,751
Actually access said material you need a reason and authorization

3162
03:08:59,519 --> 03:09:05,407
People like million Tori operating this world grabbing top-secret clearances like James Bond having a license to Kill

3163
03:09:05,919 --> 03:09:12,063
Ears removed from being an any position in the government but because he have top-secret clearance

3164
03:09:12,319 --> 03:09:13,599
Texas Dall This Confidential

3165
03:09:15,135 --> 03:09:16,415
Do you know what do you know what this is

3166
03:09:16,671 --> 03:09:21,023
This reminds me exactly of the movie Red

3167
03:09:21,535 --> 03:09:23,583
Bruce Willis

3168
03:09:23,839 --> 03:09:25,887
Did you ever don't know if anybody ever saw

3169
03:09:26,143 --> 03:09:27,423
But at one point in the movie

3170
03:09:27,679 --> 03:09:31,775
They break into Langley or whatever because you know that's not

3171
03:09:32,543 --> 03:09:36,383
And then they get down into the super secret basement where there's a v

3172
03:09:36,639 --> 03:09:38,943
With the

3173
03:09:39,455 --> 03:09:41,759
I hear the second brother

3174
03:09:42,015 --> 03:09:48,159
But it's just as old dude who called The Record Keeper our share of everything

3175
03:09:48,415 --> 03:09:51,743
You can just walk in

3176
03:09:52,767 --> 03:09:53,279
Put it away

3177
03:09:53,535 --> 03:09:55,071
I don't even want to deal with it

3178
03:09:57,119 --> 03:09:58,143
You continue not watching it

3179
03:10:01,215 --> 03:10:06,079
Coming towards the end here beside some of this stuff

3180
03:10:06,335 --> 03:10:08,383
Established

3181
03:10:08,639 --> 03:10:09,407
Basically

3182
03:10:10,687 --> 03:10:13,759
These Contracting groups primarily

3183
03:10:14,015 --> 03:10:17,343
Ecology and

3184
03:10:17,599 --> 03:10:18,111
I guess

3185
03:10:18,879 --> 03:10:19,391
Theater

3186
03:10:19,647 --> 03:10:20,415
Advice

3187
03:10:20,671 --> 03:10:26,815
I'm not even worried about names anymore

3188
03:10:27,071 --> 03:10:32,959
Information

3189
03:10:33,215 --> 03:10:35,775
They're able to do everything

3190
03:10:36,287 --> 03:10:40,127
Based on misunderstandings of Upstream data collection

3191
03:10:41,407 --> 03:10:42,431
She's taking

3192
03:10:43,455 --> 03:10:45,503
Imaginations of weirdos

3193
03:10:45,759 --> 03:10:49,855
Now we're going to get into pivoting into robots

3194
03:10:50,111 --> 03:10:51,135
Future

3195
03:10:51,391 --> 03:10:52,671
It's going to involve

3196
03:10:58,047 --> 03:10:59,327
So worried

3197
03:11:01,631 --> 03:11:07,007
When the road was the biggest problem the road as well

3198
03:11:07,263 --> 03:11:09,823
Yeah it's not a report from Interpol

3199
03:11:10,847 --> 03:11:11,359
The biggest

3200
03:11:11,615 --> 03:11:12,127
And Bowl

3201
03:11:13,151 --> 03:11:13,919
Towards the Ulta

3202
03:11:14,431 --> 03:11:15,199
Surveillance state

3203
03:11:15,455 --> 03:11:15,967
Ever made

3204
03:11:18,271 --> 03:11:19,039
Micromanage

3205
03:11:19,551 --> 03:11:20,063
This technology

3206
03:11:23,647 --> 03:11:24,671
Artificial

3207

3209
03:11:28,767 --> 03:11:29,279
The Shadow

3210
03:11:31,071 --> 03:11:32,351
Interpol

3211
03:11:32,607 --> 03:11:33,375
Publication

3212
03:11:33,631 --> 03:11:34,143
Official

3213
03:11:34,911 --> 03:11:35,679
Robotics

3214
03:11:35,935 --> 03:11:36,959
Enforcement review

3215
03:11:37,983 --> 03:11:40,543
40 there such as minority

3216
03:11:40,799 --> 03:11:42,847
Report and RoboCop

3217
03:11:45,919 --> 03:11:46,431
Technologies

3218
03:11:47,455 --> 03:11:48,735
Understanding how

3219
03:11:48,991 --> 03:11:49,503
Technology

3220
03:11:54,367 --> 03:11:56,159
Our Global community

3221
03:11:56,415 --> 03:11:56,927
Important

3222
03:12:00,255 --> 03:12:03,071
So I found

3223
03:12:03,327 --> 03:12:04,351
Because I was

3224
03:12:04,863 --> 03:12:05,375
Tired

3225
03:12:05,887 --> 03:12:08,959
Seriously

3226
03:12:09,215 --> 03:12:12,287
Literally from the Spurs

3227
03:12:12,543 --> 03:12:13,055
Paragraph

3228
03:12:13,311 --> 03:12:14,079
The forward

3229
03:12:15,871 --> 03:12:22,015
WYD

3230
03:12:22,271 --> 03:12:27,391
Clock out

3231
03:12:27,903 --> 03:12:30,719
This report has to do with a fundamental truth

3232
03:12:30,975 --> 03:12:31,999
Raiders

3233
03:12:32,255 --> 03:12:33,279
Collaborator

3234
03:12:33,535 --> 03:12:38,655
Is were recognizing at that is technology technology

3235
03:12:39,167 --> 03:12:41,983
Computer hacking or the black markets that are on the dark web

3236
03:12:42,495 --> 03:12:47,871
These things are naturally going to exist crimes are able to leverage technological advance

3237
03:12:48,639 --> 03:12:52,223
Is that true which I think it is law enforcement has a couple of options

3238
03:12:52,991 --> 03:12:57,343
The first is to be actively engaged with Technologies as strategy

3239
03:12:57,599 --> 03:12:58,111
State with change

3240
03:12:58,367 --> 03:12:58,879
X

3241
03:12:59,391 --> 03:13:03,743
The second district received the grounds of the criminal use of various emerging Technologies

3242
03:13:05,279 --> 03:13:05,791
Got a dumb

3243
03:13:06,303 --> 03:13:09,119
The report includes a lot of consideration

3244
03:13:09,375 --> 03:13:10,143
Participating

3245
03:13:10,399 --> 03:13:15,519
In those very evil evil actions

3246
03:13:15,775 --> 03:13:17,567
Your board includes a lot of consideration

3247
03:13:17,823 --> 03:13:20,639
So we'll end up coming up as a result of technological advances

3248
03:13:21,407 --> 03:13:24,223
For instance if we're to assume that robots are going to be used

3249
03:13:24,735 --> 03:13:27,039
Trolls and surveillance capabilities

3250
03:13:27,295 --> 03:13:32,415
As this occurs it will be necessary to address privacy concerns

3251
03:13:32,671 --> 03:13:36,255
Including issues such as permissible to use sensors

3252
03:13:37,023 --> 03:13:40,863
What are the main sections of this report covers house central Essex

3253
03:13:41,119 --> 03:13:43,935
Questions are in the conversation about

3254
03:13:44,447 --> 03:13:45,727
Nain 1/4

3255
03:13:46,239 --> 03:13:52,127
So yeah

3256
03:13:52,383 --> 03:13:57,247
Particularly in terms of the existing structures and up.

3257
03:13:58,015 --> 03:14:01,855
It's hard and automation is another area where these questions become super tough

3258
03:14:02,111 --> 03:14:08,255
Interpol report and read one sentence out of it while pretending that the report itself

3259
03:14:08,511 --> 03:14:11,583
Doesn't raise these serious ethical concern that's cheap

3260
03:14:11,839 --> 03:14:13,119
It's a lazy and it's dishonest

3261
03:14:13,631 --> 03:14:14,655
She is not pretending

3262
03:14:15,167 --> 03:14:16,447
You would have to have red

3263
03:14:16,703 --> 03:14:17,215
The thing

3264
03:14:17,727 --> 03:14:21,311
2 then pretend that it did not maintain this representing cheese right

3265
03:14:21,823 --> 03:14:22,335
Exactly

3266
03:14:22,591 --> 03:14:26,431
Pretty clear in this report about the challenging Terrain

3267
03:14:27,455 --> 03:14:29,759
Law enforcement also has the unique advantage

3268
03:14:30,015 --> 03:14:35,135
To be discussing these issues before the use of AI in robotics becomes a common feature in

3269
03:14:35,903 --> 03:14:40,767
If this opportunity is ignored and Ai and Robotics are used in law enforcement without

3270
03:14:41,023 --> 03:14:41,791
Accountability

3271
03:14:42,303 --> 03:14:45,887
Apparently and explainability then the law-enforcement community

3272
03:14:46,143 --> 03:14:47,679
Losing the confidence of the community

3273
03:14:47,935 --> 03:14:50,751
Citizens that is mandated to protect

3274
03:14:51,775 --> 03:14:52,287
Shut up

3275
03:14:52,799 --> 03:14:54,079
I understand you laughing

3276
03:14:54,591 --> 03:14:56,127
I understand you're laughing but

3277
03:14:59,199 --> 03:14:59,711
Nora

3278
03:14:59,967 --> 03:15:01,247
I saw a line of cops

3279
03:15:02,015 --> 03:15:03,039
Mashing their butt

3280
03:15:03,295 --> 03:15:05,599
Batons on there riot shields walking

3281
03:15:05,855 --> 03:15:07,135
Right then beating protest

3282
03:15:07,391 --> 03:15:10,463
I understand what you're saying

3283
03:15:10,719 --> 03:15:13,535
Buy land in the real world

3284
03:15:13,791 --> 03:15:16,351
Your perspective than you know

3285
03:15:20,447 --> 03:15:23,007
In terms of what we're looking at

3286
03:15:23,263 --> 03:15:25,055
With what Millie has reported

3287
03:15:25,311 --> 03:15:26,847
And what this documents

3288
03:15:30,943 --> 03:15:37,087
I find to be affirming the negative

3289
03:15:39,391 --> 03:15:42,719
I just clunk Ali pushed back on it I felt the need to respond you're doing great

3290
03:15:43,487 --> 03:15:49,631
Very tired we're on our 10

3291
03:15:49,887 --> 03:15:56,031
Little wild planet

3292
03:16:07,039 --> 03:16:07,807
Are you

3293
03:16:08,063 --> 03:16:11,391
Actually cover most of this

3294
03:16:11,903 --> 03:16:16,511
It's dumb

3295
03:16:21,887 --> 03:16:24,703
Misrepresented as being part of

3296
03:16:25,215 --> 03:16:25,983
All of this

3297
03:16:26,239 --> 03:16:26,751
Stop

3298
03:16:30,079 --> 03:16:31,871
International

3299
03:16:34,687 --> 03:16:35,199
Factor

3300
03:16:35,455 --> 03:16:36,223
Several features

3301
03:16:37,247 --> 03:16:38,015
Program

3302
03:16:39,551 --> 03:16:40,831
An iteration of shadow

3303
03:16:42,111 --> 03:16:42,623
Technology

3304
03:16:43,135 --> 03:16:44,159
This marks 27

3305
03:16:46,207 --> 03:16:46,719
Issued

3306
03:16:48,511 --> 03:16:49,279

3307
03:16:50,559 --> 03:16:51,839

3309
03:16:55,167 --> 03:16:55,935
To determine

3310
03:16:57,727 --> 03:17:00,799
Being represented dishonestly

3311
03:17:11,551 --> 03:17:13,087
Employees and replaced it with human

3312
03:17:13,343 --> 03:17:14,879
In that weird voice

3313
03:17:15,391 --> 03:17:21,535
If you read the actual patente does

3314
03:17:21,791 --> 03:17:23,071
Network action

3315
03:17:23,327 --> 03:17:25,119
Which will also update with any alerts

3316
03:17:25,375 --> 03:17:27,423
From legal public

3317
03:17:27,679 --> 03:17:28,191
Supports for

3318
03:17:28,703 --> 03:17:31,007
Make you suspicious of your employees

3319
03:17:32,543 --> 03:17:36,127
A management relations

3320
03:17:36,383 --> 03:17:37,919
These matters are wholly unrelated

3321
03:17:38,175 --> 03:17:39,711
The conspiracy that Millie is trying to spend

3322
03:17:40,223 --> 03:17:46,111
Workers rights

3323
03:17:46,623 --> 03:17:51,999
Also is from 2017 is just an updating their existing Paden from 2015 titles

3324
03:17:52,255 --> 03:17:53,535
System and method for detecting

3325
03:17:53,791 --> 03:17:55,071
Chicken employee-related risk

3326
03:17:55,839 --> 03:17:57,887
Sochi even did a sloppy job on that

3327
03:17:58,655 --> 03:18:02,495
Good work

3328
03:18:02,751 --> 03:18:05,311
Define conclusions

3329
03:18:05,823 --> 03:18:06,335
Cool

3330
03:18:06,591 --> 03:18:07,103
Call Nelly

3331
03:18:11,199 --> 03:18:12,479
Which is behind

3332
03:18:12,735 --> 03:18:13,247
Define

3333
03:18:16,575 --> 03:18:18,367
Operation

3334
03:18:18,879 --> 03:18:19,903
The case can be made

3335
03:18:20,415 --> 03:18:21,951
Jones & Co

3336
03:18:22,975 --> 03:18:23,743
The police

3337
03:18:23,999 --> 03:18:24,767
Operation

3338
03:18:25,023 --> 03:18:27,327
Simply because they are in a position to Ben

3339
03:18:29,119 --> 03:18:30,143
Alternative solution

3340
03:18:30,655 --> 03:18:31,679
Is already in line

3341
03:18:31,935 --> 03:18:32,703
Find with the green

3342
03:18:32,959 --> 03:18:33,727

3344
03:18:35,519 --> 03:18:36,031
This

3345
03:18:36,287 --> 03:18:38,079
Completely

3346
03:18:38,335 --> 03:18:38,847
Baseless

3347
03:18:40,895 --> 03:18:46,015
An argument can be made

3348
03:18:49,343 --> 03:18:53,439
I am now going to throw a balloon filled with

3349
03:18:54,463 --> 03:18:56,767
That's her I know if that would work

3350
03:18:57,279 --> 03:18:58,815
Balloon material would have

3351
03:19:05,471 --> 03:19:09,311
I definitely think

3352
03:19:10,847 --> 03:19:16,991
If you are thinking it's coming out

3353
03:19:17,247 --> 03:19:19,295
Nowhere and the disarm the police

3354
03:19:20,063 --> 03:19:20,831
You're right

3355
03:19:21,087 --> 03:19:23,391
It's disconnected

3356
03:19:24,159 --> 03:19:26,719
Here is how

3357
03:19:26,975 --> 03:19:28,767
Documentary

3358
03:19:29,023 --> 03:19:29,791
Which is just

3359
03:19:30,815 --> 03:19:33,375
Incredibly unsatisfying

3360
03:19:33,631 --> 03:19:34,655
Very little sense

3361
03:19:34,911 --> 03:19:36,703
He just decides to

3362
03:19:36,959 --> 03:19:38,751
Rowan do you win

3363
03:19:39,007 --> 03:19:43,103
And throwing his movement

3364
03:19:44,895 --> 03:19:45,407

Replacing it

3369
03:19:52,063 --> 03:19:52,575
Differently how

Who is Parker

3377
03:20:08,959 --> 03:20:09,983
Us into the ark

3378
03:20:10,239 --> 03:20:11,007
Artificial intelligence

3379
03:20:19,199 --> 03:20:20,223
Did she run out of

3380
03:20:20,479 --> 03:20:21,247
Tape

3381
03:20:24,063 --> 03:20:27,391
I guess he thought the point was made

3382
03:20:30,207 --> 03:20:33,535
She did

3383
03:20:33,791 --> 03:20:38,655
From the what if I were to tell you what the beginning I don't think that prove anything

3384
03:20:38,911 --> 03:20:45,055
Close off the thesis statement that we were working if I were her I would be so embarrassed that I

3385
03:20:45,311 --> 03:20:48,383
Put something out

3386
03:20:48,639 --> 03:20:51,455
Like is what CGI stand for

3387
03:20:51,967 --> 03:20:54,271
I would be so like

3388
03:20:55,807 --> 03:20:57,855
Like there has been a couple times

3389
03:20:58,111 --> 03:20:58,623
That's

3390
03:20:59,135 --> 03:20:59,903
I have made

3391
03:21:00,159 --> 03:21:01,183
Slight errors

3392
03:21:01,439 --> 03:21:05,279
On podcast realize like after I put out the episode

3393
03:21:05,535 --> 03:21:09,887
To be at like 4 in the morning like

3394
03:21:10,143 --> 03:21:16,287
Or even just like little tiny consideration like things are factually accurate

3395
03:21:16,799 --> 03:21:22,943
Maybe I said a name and I shouldn't set the name

3396
03:21:23,199 --> 03:21:24,991
Episode

3397
03:21:25,247 --> 03:21:27,295
Because it's

3398
03:21:27,551 --> 03:21:29,343
You make a f******

3399
03:21:29,599 --> 03:21:30,879
Like just

3400
03:21:31,391 --> 03:21:31,903
Basic

3401
03:21:32,159 --> 03:21:33,183
And pointless

3402
03:21:33,439 --> 03:21:37,535
Like CGI stands for Canadian Global Information

3403
03:21:37,791 --> 03:21:38,303
And you

3404
03:21:39,839 --> 03:21:41,887
That alone is like

3405
03:21:42,399 --> 03:21:47,263
Please call the other problems and just like really Subs

3406
03:21:47,519 --> 03:21:49,567
Sensitive misrepresentation

3407
03:21:49,823 --> 03:21:50,335
Factual

3408
03:21:50,591 --> 03:21:51,615
Inaccuracies

3409
03:21:51,871 --> 03:21:52,383
The thing is

3410
03:21:52,639 --> 03:21:53,151
Trashed

3411
03:21:54,943 --> 03:21:55,967
Convoluted

3412
03:21:56,223 --> 03:21:58,015
And contradictory backstories

3413
03:21:58,527 --> 03:22:01,343
Both of the people that she has

3414
03:22:01,599 --> 03:22:02,111
Experts

3415
03:22:02,367 --> 03:22:07,999
The contract contradiction the conflict-of-interest that exist with Tori as

3416
03:22:08,255 --> 03:22:13,631
Her unnamed source

3417
03:22:13,887 --> 03:22:16,703
But she does bring up the Kentucky

3418
03:22:16,959 --> 03:22:19,007
Unethical as hell

3419
03:22:19,263 --> 03:22:20,031
Derrius guice

3420
03:22:20,287 --> 03:22:23,359
Nothing worthwhile about this documentary

3421
03:22:23,615 --> 03:22:26,943
And I would further suggest that there's nothing in this documentary that could

3422
03:22:27,199 --> 03:22:29,247
Ever marry arrest

3423
03:22:29,759 --> 03:22:33,087
I don't think I see you until

3424
03:22:33,343 --> 03:22:34,367
Lying is well

3425
03:22:36,415 --> 03:22:40,255
Crimes against nature

3426
03:22:41,279 --> 03:22:44,607
It's like you know

3427
03:22:46,399 --> 03:22:49,215
Generous interpretation I guess someone would have

3428
03:22:49,727 --> 03:22:51,519
In the process of making

3429
03:22:51,775 --> 03:22:53,567
Dangerous ass documentary

3430
03:22:53,823 --> 03:22:57,663
She stole documents and that's what the burglary was right

3431
03:22:59,967 --> 03:23:04,575
There is nothing in this documentary that is stolen

3432
03:23:04,831 --> 03:23:06,879
And the only information that could be even like

3433
03:23:07,391 --> 03:23:09,951
Really generously interpreted that way

3434
03:23:10,207 --> 03:23:10,719
It's tough.

3435
03:23:11,743 --> 03:23:12,255
From

3436
03:23:12,767 --> 03:23:14,303
Bergey Tori

3437
03:23:14,815 --> 03:23:16,095
And neither of them got arrested

3438
03:23:16,607 --> 03:23:19,167
And they very easily could have been there known people

3439
03:23:20,191 --> 03:23:20,959
So

3440
03:23:22,239 --> 03:23:24,543
The possibility that there is any connection to her arrest

3441
03:23:25,055 --> 03:23:27,871
And what I'm going to do I did this on purpose

3442
03:23:28,895 --> 03:23:32,735
I wanted to

3443
03:23:32,991 --> 03:23:34,527
Yeah

3444
03:23:34,783 --> 03:23:36,063
Just be unwieldy

3445
03:23:37,343 --> 03:23:38,111
100%

3446
03:23:38,367 --> 03:23:40,159
So I haven't

3447
03:23:40,927 --> 03:23:41,695
Alex is coverage

3448
03:23:42,207 --> 03:23:43,487
Yeah

3449
03:23:43,999 --> 03:23:45,279
I don't know what he say

3450
03:23:45,535 --> 03:23:46,303
But I'm sure it's b*******

3451
03:23:46,815 --> 03:23:50,143
We will go over Alex's

3452
03:23:50,399 --> 03:23:54,751
Coverage point

3453
03:23:58,847 --> 03:23:59,615
Holding cell

3454
03:23:59,871 --> 03:24:03,199
Better do that

3455
03:24:03,711 --> 03:24:07,039
Apologies of people were expecting like Alex's response to the arrest

3456
03:24:07,295 --> 03:24:08,063
I don't know what it is

3457
03:24:08,319 --> 03:24:08,831
I don't care

3458
03:24:09,087 --> 03:24:12,415
I've watched this documentary too many times taken up too much of my time

3459
03:24:13,183 --> 03:24:13,951
How

3460
03:24:14,719 --> 03:24:15,231
Dare

3461
03:24:15,487 --> 03:24:16,255
Millie Weaver

3462
03:24:17,023 --> 03:24:19,327
Make Alex look like a good document

3463
03:24:20,607 --> 03:24:26,495
Or I would say I mean I don't want to sound sexist because

3464
03:24:26,751 --> 03:24:29,055
Greg Reese

3465
03:24:33,919 --> 03:24:38,271
Voiceover context

3466
03:24:38,527 --> 03:24:39,295
The documentary

3467
03:24:39,807 --> 03:24:41,343
Yeah it's not that her voice

3468
03:24:41,599 --> 03:24:43,647
Is terrible

3469
03:24:44,415 --> 03:24:44,927
The writing

3470
03:24:45,183 --> 03:24:47,999
And the delivery delivery is bad

3471
03:24:48,255 --> 03:24:51,839
Alex

3472
03:24:52,351 --> 03:24:53,375
The little more

3473
03:24:53,887 --> 03:24:54,911
It's not working

3474
03:24:55,167 --> 03:25:00,799
Careful with his subject matter

3475
03:25:01,055 --> 03:25:01,567
Yeah that's

3476
03:25:01,823 --> 03:25:07,967
Interview subjects

3477
03:25:08,223 --> 03:25:10,527
F****** spotlight

3478
03:25:11,039 --> 03:25:12,319
Yeah

3479
03:25:21,279 --> 03:25:27,423
Suffers from the same problem production values are much better on Alex's

3480
03:25:27,679 --> 03:25:29,983
The round was probably a really good editor

3481
03:25:30,239 --> 03:25:32,287
Yeah

3482
03:25:32,543 --> 03:25:35,103
Help values aw

3483
03:25:35,615 --> 03:25:37,151
And

3484
03:25:37,919 --> 03:25:38,687
Husband

3485
03:25:38,943 --> 03:25:41,759
Edited this I don't think it was very well done

3486
03:25:45,855 --> 03:25:48,415
Content standpoint I guess I would say

3487
03:25:57,631 --> 03:25:58,143
Yeah

3488
03:26:01,471 --> 03:26:06,335
What up

3489
03:26:07,103 --> 03:26:08,895
Couple giggle

3490
03:26:09,407 --> 03:26:10,175
This sucks

3491
03:26:10,431 --> 03:26:13,247
I'm sorry Jordan I apologize pieces beginning of this but

3492
03:26:13,503 --> 03:26:19,647
It was required that we do it now you can go home and take a nap

3493
03:26:25,791 --> 03:26:26,559
Our duty

3494
03:26:26,815 --> 03:26:27,327
Yep

3495
03:26:29,119 --> 03:26:29,887
Jordan

3496
03:26:30,399 --> 03:26:31,167
Will be back

3497
03:26:32,191 --> 03:26:36,799
Maybe not the one that doesn't

3498
03:26:37,055 --> 03:26:40,639
Stay tuned

3499
03:26:41,663 --> 03:26:44,223

Dzx Clark I Madero runda
