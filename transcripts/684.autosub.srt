1
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:20,992
Air Jordan

2
00:00:21,248 --> 00:00:27,392
I have great respect for knowledge B I'm sick of them

3
00:00:34,048 --> 00:00:40,192
MoneyGram

4
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:59,136
Dot-com

5
00:00:59,648 --> 00:01:02,208
Everybody come back to knowledge

6
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:05,280
All Jordans

7
00:01:05,536 --> 00:01:07,328
Empathy altruism

8
00:01:07,584 --> 00:01:08,608
Alex Jones

9
00:01:08,864 --> 00:01:10,656
Indeed we are Dan

10
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:11,424
Jordan

11
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,960
Damn

12
00:01:13,472 --> 00:01:13,984
Quick question

13
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,008
Emporia what's up

14
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,288
What you bright spot

15
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:22,944
By Bryce Potts Jordan is

16
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:23,712
Recording

17
00:01:24,224 --> 00:01:25,504
With no shoes on

18
00:01:28,832 --> 00:01:34,464
There is a situation we have here is that

19
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:38,560
Other than the time that you were overseas

20
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:43,424
On one of your many vacations is the first time we've we've recorded

21
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:45,728
Not in the same place

22
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:46,752
I like

23
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:48,800
To put on you know

24
00:01:49,056 --> 00:01:50,080
Professional pants

25
00:01:50,336 --> 00:01:51,616
Put on socks and shoes

26
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:54,432
Professional

27
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:56,992
Semi-professional pants

28
00:01:57,504 --> 00:02:03,648
Business casual

29
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:05,696
But it was because I didn't want to do the show

30
00:02:05,952 --> 00:02:07,488
Like

31
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:12,352
Stealing like really casual

32
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:17,984
I just was doing a lot of courtesy for you it turns out.

33
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:20,544
I feel just fine

34
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:26,432
I really did put pants on for this

35
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:29,504
Professional

36
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:35,392
Seen so many of these stories were people accidentally reveal themselves so I've got

37
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:38,976
Another

38
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:41,280
Yeah absolutely sure

39
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:47,424
Yeah that's that's a reasonable concern but I do. So that's a concern is is is

40
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:52,032
Is limited streaming broadcasting bestow such a mother

41
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:56,896
Places out of abundance

42
00:02:57,152 --> 00:02:57,664
Caution

43
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:00,992
Do you want to get into that at all

44
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:04,576
Oh yeah I mean my my partner is ill

45
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:07,904
Are we taking between us for covid

46
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:12,000
But all-in-all is come back negative

47
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:14,560
So we're pretty sure it's just that regular old flu

48
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:15,840
From

49
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:17,376
From the flute

50
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,472
Who knows do you know you never know it could

51
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:23,008
Could be an invisible super strength

52
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:24,288
It's like that

53
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:25,568
Kind of Bankers Life

54
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:29,152
Right at this point you don't know

55
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:30,176
Sure

56
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:34,528
It's okay we're recording in separate locations out of that tub that a bunch

57
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:38,368
The caution and because of that we

58
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:42,720
Yo I think we've teased that we're going to have like a muscle fiber episode on Monday

59
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:48,352
Spoiler alert that's because there's a deposition episode coming up

60
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:49,120
You know what

61
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:51,936
Has the potential to be super long

62
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:56,288
That over over a zoo

63
00:03:57,568 --> 00:04:02,176
So that will have to be to require our best you know and I think we do our best

64
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:06,016
That's whenever we're we're right in there

65
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:12,672
So what's your bright spot

66
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:17,791
My bright spot Dan is a couple weeks after my birthday late

67
00:04:18,047 --> 00:04:19,327
Do you know what that means

68
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:28,287
Another tennis based right spot

69
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:35,967
The first year is

70
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:38,783
I think it's the first year in probably 30

71
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:40,575
Team that Rafa is not the

72
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:42,111
The favorite to win the French Open

73
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:43,903
Sacre bleu

74
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:45,439
15 years

75
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:47,999
15 years

76
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:50,815
Sir

77
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:53,119
Ronnie got a French

78
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:55,423
Who is the favorite

79
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:57,471
I would say

80
00:04:57,983 --> 00:05:04,127
Djokovic has the favorite just because he's older and he's done it more but how come get us kicked out of the country

81
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:07,199
I mean at well yeah that's the reason he didn't win the Australian

82
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:10,527
So I would say that alcaraz

83
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:14,111
Playing the best tennis right now he's 90

84
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:14,879
18 years old

85
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:18,463
He's gone from 82 number six in the world

86
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:19,999
Three months

87
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:21,023
The man is

88
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:21,791
Incredible

89
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:24,351
Man I mean that in the loosest sense

90
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:25,375
The word because he is

91
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:26,143
Is a child

92
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:31,519
I like that that show that Sam Neill show alcaraz

93
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:34,079
I'm sorry

94
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:37,151
It was a show called Alcatraz I got to go

95
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:41,247
No that's right that about the recording did not break

96
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:42,527
Nope

97
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:48,671
Very very well forgotten TV show Alcatraz star in

98
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:51,487
I think I left

99
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:52,767
I think it was a male

100
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:59,167
Put on the back-burner I was

101
00:05:59,423 --> 00:06:00,959
Put him in timeout because

102
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:03,007
Reggae sucks

103
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:08,383
Not a fun time after the last week's coverage of the Buffalo shooting

104
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:13,759
I felt like the Alex Jones was right stuff about that was just getting to be a little bit obnoxious

105
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:18,879
So the deposition was for us to go into

106
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:20,415
Play nice

107
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:22,719
Sure and that I hit was

108
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:23,487
Instead

109
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:28,095
2003's always there why not

110
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:29,119
The present date

111
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:30,143
Called me back

112
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:32,959
Again good necessitated that II

113
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:34,239
I show back up

114
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:37,567
And so today we're going to be going over dumpster you couldn't

115
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:40,383
Stay away you just had to go get a closer look

116
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:41,919
Yeah he's burning

117
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:43,967
Yep that is correct

118
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:47,039
I am so today we'll check out this this flaming

00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:52,159

Mix me up

126
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:21,599
Trying to trying to screw me up with these tongue twisters

127
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:25,183
That was a tongue twister I legit was like I must be a reference

128
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:26,975
It's just that I've never seen before

129
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:36,703
Fins to the right not the only one

130
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:37,727
Very much

131
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:39,519

Can we come

141
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:14,591
To the beginning

142
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:15,615
Ivar episode

143
00:08:17,407 --> 00:08:18,431
And

144
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:20,223
Here here's the deal

145
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:23,551
That's really why we have to stay in the Press

146
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:25,087
Really really

147
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:28,415
There's a drastically drastically big news of foot

148
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:31,999
And this is how Alex begin to show here on Friday

149
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:34,815
20th

150
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:36,607
L is 20

151
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:38,655
We are going to break

152
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:40,191
Here today

153
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:41,983
Starting now

154
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:44,031
The biggest

155
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:46,079
28-year

156
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:49,919
We saw this coming months ago

157
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:51,711
Archivist

158
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:02,975
The warning

159
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:05,535
But now it's

160
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:09,375
The biggest news of Alex's career

161
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:10,911
What's happened

162
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:12,703
It happened

163
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:13,471
Yeah

164
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:17,055
But I mean like all of it or just some

165
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:22,943
I feel like we here periodically about the biggest news of Alex's career I feel like rice

166
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:24,735
Take a note

167
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:25,503
Quality

168
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:28,063
Rolling down our windows

169
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:29,343
In traffic is that how

170
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:36,767
You will later be employed to call people and tell them to knit I don't know if it's the point of stop

171
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:37,791
Stopping traffic by

172
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:40,607
It's probably it's probably fairly close

173
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:47,007
See here's the thing man via the news that Alex has to cover biggest of his career absolutely

174
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:48,031
Without a doubt

175
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:49,567
He's so big that like he just

176
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:51,103
Get to it

177
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:52,895
Kick it do it

178
00:09:55,199 --> 00:09:56,479
This is so big

179
00:09:58,015 --> 00:10:00,063
Then if you just mention it or talk about it

180
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:03,903
It doesn't do it justice and until the best way to start with this is this way

181
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:09,791
If you remember

182
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:10,815
4 years ago

183
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:12,607
We said the un's going to release some

184
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:14,399
Bioweapon

185
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:22,335
Confound

186
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:26,175
Change the whole world blow up

187
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:27,199
System

188
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:29,247
Gutter systems

189
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:37,951
So this is really

190
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:43,839
Around the corner regularly for the past 20 years

191
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:50,239
He definitely could find some clips of him saying something like that from 2019 and said that

192
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:52,287
2008 or any other

193
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:56,127
Honestly kind of thought we were still doing it 2003

194
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:57,407
Episode I feel like I could have

195
00:10:57,663 --> 00:11:01,247
We'll get a little bit later

196
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:06,623
Shut up about what he predicted in order to make himself seem more accurate

197
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:13,023
He wasn't talking about mRNA vaccines until right up to the point where the right-wing blogs

198
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:14,047
Started to get upset

199
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:17,119
About vaccines

200
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:22,239
This is part of the reason that Meme is so Insidious

201
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:28,639
If you've bought into the Alex Jones Is Right game that you might be far more willing to hear Alex make stuff

202
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:30,943
Except

203
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:35,295
Once you believe that Alex has been right more about the staff than you think

204
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:40,159
You subordinate your own instincts and critical-thinking to Alex's imaginary expertise

205
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:41,695
Dangerous

206
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:48,607
Believing that Alex knew what mRNA before it was on a conservative blog is just absurd

207
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:51,935
He's a b b nonsense

208
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:58,335
The reason that Alex is starting off covering the story by rambling b******* about how he's been so right

209
00:11:58,591 --> 00:11:59,615
Parents is because

210
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:00,639
It's a less

211
00:12:00,895 --> 00:12:05,247
Openly desperate way for him to beg the audience to believe what he's about to tell

212
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:12,927
It's essentially like you got to take me seriously it because don't you remember how right I've been about everything I've actually been wrong about

213
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:14,463
Listen straight up

214
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:19,839
I am going to warn you by telling you how right I've always been how wrong I'm about to

215
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:21,631
To be right in your face

216
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:22,911
It's going to be loud

217
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:28,031
So we have we have some dangerous World developments

218
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:32,383
Upon us that Alex is going to get into before he gets into the most import

219
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:35,455
News of his career but I guess this kind of actually isn't.

220
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:37,759
Let's move into a

221
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:42,879
On the 23rd to the 28th

222
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:44,159
Switzerland

223
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:44,927
In Geneva

224
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:49,279
Economic Forum will direct them

225
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:57,471
Play the clipse

226
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:09,503
Military operation

227
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:14,367
World government

228
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:18,207
Putting the control of a major Western military

229
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:20,255
Forced lockdown

230
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:21,791
It'll make the last one look like

231
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:23,839
Gas

232
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:26,655
Like

233
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:28,959
Australia

234
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:31,007
Who's the whole load of b*******

235
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:34,847
Which which corporations owned the UN

236
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:36,639
What did Biden say

237
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:38,175
11

238
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:41,759
Yeah it's it's it's a lot of made-up fun stuff from

239
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:43,295
Conspiracy blogs and what-have-you

240
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:49,951
Give me upcoming World Health assembly meeting is happening in the in the actually believe it starts today

241
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:55,071
But he'll go to the gym and sit cross-legged in

242
00:13:56,863 --> 00:14:01,983
There's a there's a group of kids in action or whatever who do a song song A Summer

243
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:04,031
70000 stop smoking

244
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:07,871
Plant discussion of the international Health regulations

245
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:11,967
And there's a name of improving International responses to Future pandemics

246
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:14,271
That's basically the kernel of Truth

247
00:14:14,527 --> 00:14:16,063
That's behind all this b*******

248
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:21,183
Talking about traces back to spread about the amendment

249
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:22,975
The could be added to these regulation

250
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:29,119
Some of the amendments in these blogs to do with article 12

251
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:31,167
It's actually real

252
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:37,311
This proposed amendment would the director-general of the WHIO determines a health emergency

253
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:44,223
Previously the director General ABC active

254
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:47,295
Emergency before the World Health Organization

255
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:48,575
Did make a determination

256
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:50,367
Now

257
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:54,207
Now the state party is not required to agree that there's a health emerge

258
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:55,487
Okay

259
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:58,047
The impetus of this amendment is really obvious

260
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:00,863
There's a concern that in the early days of covid

261
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:06,239
The Chinese government may not have been perfectly transparent about the situation and whether or not that

262
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:07,775
Material impact

263
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:08,543
Responded

264
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:10,079
It raises important

265
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:15,199
If there's a public health emergency that could affect other countries and possibly the entire world

266
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:19,807
What do you do if you have reason to suspect that a country isn't being forthcoming about the

267
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:22,623
Situation or not giving information

268
00:15:23,135 --> 00:15:26,207
And data to do the rest of the world

269
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:27,487
Decisions on

270
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:34,143
This amendment seeks to address

271
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:35,679
Termination before they make it

272
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:42,591
This has nothing to do you enter the World Health Organization Ableton able to

273
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:43,359
Take over

274
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:46,431
All the West Military then put people into a lock

275
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:48,223
This is ridiculous

276
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:50,783
I do appreciate how

277
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:52,575
Powerful the UN is

278
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:53,599
Is in the conservator

279
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:54,367
Remind

280
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:55,135
It's so

281
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:59,743
So powerful un would actually be able to

282
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:02,815
Go to go into China and look at their enemies

283
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:03,839
Without guidance

284
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:04,607
Consent

285
00:16:06,911 --> 00:16:11,007
MB International Health regulations even if you read them

286
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:14,847
Specifically say that a state is able to

287
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:16,895
Agree with

288
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:22,527
Reply or not comply with World Health organization's recommendation

289
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:26,111
So that doesn't

290
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:28,159
Do anything

291
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:29,183
Just a load of s***

292
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:33,535
Amendment that they're really mad about is the one where you have

293
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:34,559
2 quarter in

294
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:35,327
Can feed Soldier

295
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:36,863
That's the crazy

296
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:40,191
Listen to your home

297
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:45,567
Pandemic soldiers no less doctors nurses

298
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:47,615
You must quarter everyone

299
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:49,151
Alex

300
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:55,551
Believe that they've been broadcasting this stuff that there's going to be another pandemic

301
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:57,343
Spoiler alert all this is about monkey

302
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:01,439
Alex is visiting like

303
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:04,255
Yeah they said all this in advance in order to

304
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:06,559
In order to let you know that it's going to happen

305
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:08,351
Because they're like villain

306
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:10,143
In comic books

307
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:12,447
Because Alex believes that the world

308
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:14,239
Old is basically a children's cartoon

309
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:30,367
Criminals always

310
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:35,231
And should be confident to their criminal armies

311
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:49,567
Supervillain cartoon owl

312
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:53,407
The villain always monologues

313
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:55,711
Villains do

314
00:17:56,223 --> 00:17:57,247
Old dramatic tension

315
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:04,671
That's that's what they dramatic tension

316
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:10,815
It's also an element of the plot be difficult to do any other way

317
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:12,351
That mean many people use

318
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:13,119
Is those 4S

319
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:17,215
Position because as viewers were aware of a lot of stuff

320
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:18,239
The characters art

321
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:23,103
Answer the bad guy telling the hero what their plan is it kind of serves to as a shortcut

322
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:27,199
Get them up to speed on the same page

323
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:27,967
To the film

324
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:28,991
It's

325
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:30,271
Not something that is from

326
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:32,063
Criminology

327
00:18:32,575 --> 00:18:35,647
It's pretty much like a The Village

328
00:18:35,903 --> 00:18:36,415
Did you give a good quick

329
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:38,463
Chick-fil-A and you know like I listen

330
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:40,511
Show the audience all of this stuff I'll get

331
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:42,047
Real quick

332
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:45,887
I know

333
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:47,679
You know old man you killed me

334
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:53,567
You know everything now as the hero of the films are able to respond appropriately and know what the

335
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:55,871
The delays have you entered the Final Act

336
00:18:56,895 --> 00:18:59,455
So stupid real-life criminology

337
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:01,247
That's what these people do

338
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:02,015
Yeah

339
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:06,111
Alex's imaginary enemies do this stuff in advance

340
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:08,671
Because I have to according to Intergalactic laws

341
00:19:09,183 --> 00:19:15,327
You don't choose to fight back against that you're basically accepting and consent

342
00:19:16,863 --> 00:19:18,655
Alexensual forgotten that storyline

343
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:23,007
Also he seems to have forgotten the whole race war lockdowns thing and Boots

344
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:25,311
Musli back to pandemic lockdown

345
00:19:25,823 --> 00:19:27,359
I wonder I wonder why

346
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:33,503
Oh my God nothing on this show means anything at all it's freaking frustrating

347
00:19:34,015 --> 00:19:34,783
I mean it sweeps

348
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:38,623
You know so you got to get rid of all of those meat

349
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:39,903
Cute storylines

350
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:40,671
Then you got to get back

351
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:41,951
Back to the main storyline

352
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:45,023
And make sure everybody's ready to find out who shot Jr

353
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:47,327
That is essentially what Infowars is

354
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:53,215
It's almost like Alex was desperately grabbing at straws at anything he could do to deflect

355
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:56,543
Attention away from the reality of the story of the Buffalo shooting

356
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:59,615
And now that it's kind of blown over at least

357
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:00,639
Appointment

358
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:02,943
She's worried about the conversation

359
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:05,503
He can move on to other things and pretend that all that s***

360
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:09,087
You never really said that race an hour lockdown we're right around the corner

361
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:10,623
Globalist

362
00:20:11,135 --> 00:20:12,671
Call the same time

363
00:20:13,183 --> 00:20:14,207
Acting as though

364
00:20:15,231 --> 00:20:15,743
News like

365
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:17,279
Completely reasonable thing

366
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:18,559
Do you say at the

367
00:20:18,815 --> 00:20:19,327
What time

368
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:20,351
Now that that's

369
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:21,631
Let's blow it over

370
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:22,399
It's just a bit

371
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:24,703
Just never happened

372
00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:25,727
No

373
00:20:28,031 --> 00:20:29,311
I don't know

374
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:31,615
There's a solecism

375
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:35,455
About Alex's information that like

376
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:38,783
It's not immediately here at s*** isn't real

377
00:20:39,295 --> 00:20:40,063
It's annoying

378
00:20:40,575 --> 00:20:41,087
Doesn't say

379
00:20:41,343 --> 00:20:43,391
Didn't have to tell you what's going on because of

380
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:46,463
Contract with God and all well that's

381
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:48,511
Yeah that's the intergalactic law part

382
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:52,095
Literally in

383
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:52,863
Intergalactic

384
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:53,631
Cannot

385
00:20:53,887 --> 00:20:54,399
Just spiritual

386
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:55,167
Gotcha

387
00:20:55,423 --> 00:20:57,727
Also one of the

388
00:20:57,983 --> 00:21:02,079
It's to the international Health regulation is that the director-general

389
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:05,663
Fancy Nancy head of state don't all have

390
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:08,479
Out-of-the-loop for health emergencies

391
00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:09,759
In the future

392
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:12,575
Azazel reading that part of the

393
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:15,391
Beelzebub

394
00:21:15,903 --> 00:21:16,928
Old Scratch

395
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,976
Bank of America under a whole bunch

396
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:21,024
The different name

397
00:21:21,536 --> 00:21:24,096
So like I mentioned this obviously

398
00:21:24,608 --> 00:21:27,680
Listen store showing off and has a

399
00:21:27,936 --> 00:21:29,984
Vega weariness of the world would have been able to tell

400
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,520
Already that this is about money

401
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:32,288
Monkeypox

402
00:21:33,312 --> 00:21:38,176
But we go Alex finally lays it out that this is about monkeypox

403
00:21:38,432 --> 00:21:39,968
Okay let me know

404
00:21:44,832 --> 00:21:45,344
Today

405
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,880
Don't understand ours last night

406
00:21:47,392 --> 00:21:47,904
Today

407
00:21:49,184 --> 00:21:51,232
Documents

408
00:21:57,376 --> 00:21:58,656
Angrily people anymore

409
00:21:58,912 --> 00:22:01,984
Sell my soul is

410
00:22:09,408 --> 00:22:09,920
Because

411
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,272
Smallpox in monkeypod

412
00:22:17,856 --> 00:22:20,672
Hoarders monkeypox

413
00:22:21,184 --> 00:22:22,208
Vaccine

414
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,584
And then magically right on time

415
00:22:30,656 --> 00:22:32,448
Monkeypox pops up

416
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:38,592
So monkeypox wasn't part of Alex a s*** about Gates until exactly this moment

417
00:22:39,616 --> 00:22:42,944
Although Alex did obsess over gates very normal warnings

418
00:22:43,968 --> 00:22:46,784
Would be the last Public Health crisis we would face

419
00:22:47,296 --> 00:22:48,832
Alex is saying like

420
00:22:49,088 --> 00:22:49,856
Oh yes

421
00:22:50,112 --> 00:22:55,744
Smallpox and monkeypox about smallpox

422
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,816
Where Bill Gates in passing reference

423
00:22:59,072 --> 00:23:00,608
Like people doing

424
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:04,960
I've sort of exercises to think about like what would we do

425
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:07,520
If terrorists released smallpox

426
00:23:08,032 --> 00:23:09,568
Sure

427
00:23:10,848 --> 00:23:12,128
If he's been like a ha

428
00:23:12,384 --> 00:23:16,992
That was Gates is playing at Elsa wedding sets

429
00:23:17,248 --> 00:23:21,088
Come on man

430
00:23:21,344 --> 00:23:21,856
Is epoxy

431
00:23:22,112 --> 00:23:25,184
Does the fox okay

432
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,208
Dog box

433
00:23:27,488 --> 00:23:29,280
Big-box doesn't matter of fox

434
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:36,704
There's a lot going on here cuz I'm going to try and break this down a little bit bit by bit and the first thing I should point out is that listeners

435
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:40,288
Show maybe a bit more familiar with monkeypox than the general population

436
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:43,616
That's because Alex already did this whole thing back in 2000

437
00:23:49,504 --> 00:23:52,832
So this is a little bit this is another witchy thing that is

438
00:23:53,088 --> 00:23:54,112
Harry Potter

439
00:23:57,184 --> 00:23:59,488
That is so funny the kind of thought that eats

440
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,560
If he really went back to our 2003 episodes

441
00:24:03,072 --> 00:24:03,840
Certified sub clips

442
00:24:04,096 --> 00:24:04,864
Beads

443
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:05,888
Serious about love

444
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:08,960
If you was using the

445
00:24:09,216 --> 00:24:15,360
The cases of monkeypox that were identified as

446
00:24:15,616 --> 00:24:17,920
Axiom

447
00:24:18,176 --> 00:24:20,224
In 2003 he's just doing it again

448
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:24,064
20 years on

449
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,112
Yeah he doesn't have many tricks

450
00:24:26,624 --> 00:24:31,744
The present-day Alex's intentionally mixing up cause and effect in order to create the appearance of conspiracy

451
00:24:32,256 --> 00:24:37,120
He's claiming it by north of these monkey pox vaccines of ventilator monkeypox cases popped up

452
00:24:37,376 --> 00:24:40,448
By presenting things like this is very explicitly trying

453
00:24:40,704 --> 00:24:41,472
To tell his audience

454
00:24:41,728 --> 00:24:46,080
That the order for vaccines with me because of foreknowledge of the coming monkeypox

455
00:24:46,336 --> 00:24:46,848
Cases

456
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:53,504
This is important because it's Ally use as the foundation upon to build

457
00:24:54,016 --> 00:24:56,320
His argument that the whole thing was a false flag

458
00:24:57,856 --> 00:24:59,904
Despite the fact that even if it was

459
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:02,208
The case that he ordered it before again it is

460
00:25:02,464 --> 00:25:03,488
The very smart move

461
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:04,768
To have vaccine

462
00:25:06,048 --> 00:25:07,584
Caesar

463
00:25:08,864 --> 00:25:09,376
Yeah

464
00:25:09,632 --> 00:25:10,144
But

465
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:10,912
Like

466
00:25:11,168 --> 00:25:15,520
If you had just out of the blue randomly ordered these these Monk

467
00:25:15,776 --> 00:25:16,800
Monkey pox vaccines

468
00:25:17,312 --> 00:25:20,384
It would seem a little bit more suspicious

469
00:25:20,896 --> 00:25:21,664
But in the real world

470
00:25:22,176 --> 00:25:26,016
The US government ordered 119 billion dollars worth of the vaccine

471
00:25:26,272 --> 00:25:28,576
Which is good for smallpox and monkeypox

472
00:25:28,832 --> 00:25:31,392
Case was confirmed in Massachusetts

473
00:25:31,648 --> 00:25:33,952
The first in the US during this outbreak

474
00:25:34,464 --> 00:25:37,536
Order was made it wasn't

475
00:25:37,792 --> 00:25:39,840
Well in advance haha

476
00:25:40,096 --> 00:25:41,120
We know it by humming

477
00:25:41,376 --> 00:25:43,168
Let's get ready

478
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,704
We thought

479
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:48,800
119 billion dollars worth of this vaccine is not like

480
00:25:49,312 --> 00:25:53,408
It's not enough for even probably the entirety of Massachusetts

481
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:59,296
Honestly it's not like we're not going to be able to inoculate the entire country based on this

482
00:25:59,552 --> 00:26:01,856
It's a sparrow

483
00:26:02,112 --> 00:26:04,672
Amount of Reserve that you would have

484
00:26:04,928 --> 00:26:07,232
Cases pop up

485
00:26:07,488 --> 00:26:08,768
Insert

486
00:26:09,024 --> 00:26:10,048
Various locales

487
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:12,608
Basically like what they didn't 2003

488
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:16,192
Right right right no I mean it's it's so hard to

489
00:26:16,448 --> 00:26:16,960
Understand

490
00:26:17,216 --> 00:26:17,984
N-Scale anymore

491
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:18,752
You know like

492
00:26:19,008 --> 00:26:21,568
119 million dollars is so much

493
00:26:22,336 --> 00:26:22,848
Money

494
00:26:23,104 --> 00:26:24,640
But then again you remind yourself interview

495
00:26:24,896 --> 00:26:25,408
Scale

496
00:26:25,664 --> 00:26:26,176
That's like

497
00:26:26,432 --> 00:26:27,200
America

498
00:26:27,456 --> 00:26:27,968
Can government

499
00:26:28,224 --> 00:26:28,736
Like

500
00:26:28,992 --> 00:26:30,528
Peeing just a little bit in your mouth

501
00:26:30,784 --> 00:26:32,064
This is close

502
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:32,832
You know it's not

503
00:26:33,344 --> 00:26:39,488
It's millions of doses

504
00:26:39,744 --> 00:26:41,792
But it's in the low millions of doses

505
00:26:42,816 --> 00:26:44,352
About like what you would expect

506
00:26:44,608 --> 00:26:45,376
Ed McKay's

507
00:26:45,632 --> 00:26:48,448
That you might see cases and

508
00:26:51,264 --> 00:26:56,128
Healthcare workers that might be in contact with people or if you can identify clusters

509
00:26:56,384 --> 00:26:59,456
You know if there is there is a utility to this but it's not like

510
00:27:00,224 --> 00:27:01,248
It's not like operation Warp

511
00:27:01,504 --> 00:27:03,296
Speedway

512
00:27:03,552 --> 00:27:04,832
Billions of dollars

513
00:27:05,088 --> 00:27:06,624
It would be at 8

514
00:27:08,416 --> 00:27:09,696
You cannot

515
00:27:09,952 --> 00:27:11,488
Appropriately react to

516
00:27:12,768 --> 00:27:13,792
Possible disease

517
00:27:14,048 --> 00:27:17,120
I know it doesn't feel like

518
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:21,984
Great we saw it with

519
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,544
Monkeypox in 2003

520
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:27,104
Ebola under Obama

521
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:27,872
This is not

522
00:27:28,128 --> 00:27:29,152
Impossible

523
00:27:30,944 --> 00:27:37,088
Pretty different covid inasmuch as like it's a known quantity and there are some therapeutic

524
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:41,952
Obviously

525
00:27:42,464 --> 00:27:44,256
This is not an analogous situation

526
00:27:45,024 --> 00:27:49,120
The first case in this outbreak was reported to the World Health Organization on May 7th

527
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:52,448
From the UK who travel to Nigeria

528
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:59,104
Has been 92 laboratory confirmed cases and 12 countries where monkeypox is not in

529
00:28:00,128 --> 00:28:04,736
This is a big deal and as much as any novel spreading of a disease is a big deal but

530
00:28:04,992 --> 00:28:06,016
It's not time for Mike Adams

531
00:28:06,272 --> 00:28:07,552
Come back into clear that it's over

532
00:28:07,808 --> 00:28:08,320
Humanity

533
00:28:10,624 --> 00:28:11,648
Based on the way Alex's

534
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:12,928
Going about this

535
00:28:14,976 --> 00:28:21,120
It's really hard to say for sure how this is going to progress but I tend to agree with the World Health organization's assessment that its height

536
00:28:21,376 --> 00:28:24,192
There will be more cases

537
00:28:24,448 --> 00:28:30,592
But I also feel like it would be Hasty to jump to the conclusion that this is going to be any kind of large-scale pandemic all over it

538
00:28:31,616 --> 00:28:36,224
Like I said in 2003 there were 71 reported cases in 6 US states

539
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:40,832
And through proper tracing practices and targeted vaccine deployment the outbreak didn't spread

540
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:44,160
This is something to be aware of and obviously people should be

541
00:28:44,416 --> 00:28:48,768
Be careful as best they can but the type of typing and fear-mongering Alex's engaged

542
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:50,816
Is deeply irresponsible

543
00:28:54,144 --> 00:28:55,168
It is again

544
00:28:55,936 --> 00:28:57,216
When he did this with the

545
00:28:57,472 --> 00:28:58,752
The other pandemic pasta

546
00:28:59,264 --> 00:28:59,776
Diseases in the

547
00:29:00,032 --> 00:29:00,544
The past

548
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:03,872
Responded to those appropriately

549
00:29:04,128 --> 00:29:04,640
So his

550
00:29:04,896 --> 00:29:05,920
Is b******* didn't

551
00:29:06,176 --> 00:29:07,456
Cause any further harm

552
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,784
When we respond to an inappropriately

553
00:29:11,296 --> 00:29:12,064
His disease

554
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:13,088
Spreads out of

555
00:29:13,344 --> 00:29:14,624
Control almost

556
00:29:15,136 --> 00:29:15,648
In concert with

557
00:29:19,488 --> 00:29:20,000
Yep

558
00:29:21,024 --> 00:29:24,608
One of the things that's fine about this this turn of events

559
00:29:24,864 --> 00:29:27,424
This these cases being identified of monkeypox

560
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:29,216
Is it alive

561
00:29:29,728 --> 00:29:32,032
Play games with

562
00:29:32,288 --> 00:29:33,312
Covid conspiracy

563
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:34,592
I feel like

564
00:29:34,848 --> 00:29:36,384
The gate like the

565
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:41,504
The songs that he was playing about covid vaccines and stuff we're getting a little bit tired

566
00:29:45,344 --> 00:29:46,880
Jazz improvisation for him

567
00:29:47,392 --> 00:29:49,184
The Jukebox is getting old

568
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,488
Diners from the 1950

569
00:29:51,744 --> 00:29:55,072
Cuz you got to update this s*** and update he does

570
00:29:59,424 --> 00:30:01,472
A Europe

571
00:30:03,264 --> 00:30:04,032
Where you at

572
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:11,712
Gentleman

573
00:30:14,272 --> 00:30:16,064
Because what is AstraZeneca in jnj

574
00:30:19,392 --> 00:30:21,184
The Genome of a chimpanzee

575
00:30:22,464 --> 00:30:23,744
I'm sorry what

576
00:30:24,256 --> 00:30:25,536
And then hold on

577
00:30:35,264 --> 00:30:36,800
Flash

578
00:30:37,824 --> 00:30:38,336
Preparing

579
00:30:38,592 --> 00:30:39,616
Smallpox

580
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,152
Box

581
00:30:41,664 --> 00:30:42,688
Then the FBI

582
00:30:43,712 --> 00:30:45,504
Storage facility

583
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,112
Find smallpox in refrigerator

584
00:30:50,368 --> 00:30:51,136
They're just putting that out there

585
00:30:52,928 --> 00:30:56,512
Crashes in Pennsylvania

586
00:31:01,376 --> 00:31:01,888
Top Donuts

587
00:31:12,896 --> 00:31:13,920
James Bond

588
00:31:19,552 --> 00:31:20,832
Global trading

589
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,184
Control

590
00:31:30,048 --> 00:31:30,816
All

591
00:31:31,072 --> 00:31:32,352
Here it's happening

592
00:31:32,608 --> 00:31:34,400
It all makes sense

593
00:31:34,912 --> 00:31:39,776
I mean it's all coming together finally

594
00:31:40,288 --> 00:31:46,432
Desperate for a way to attack the covid vaccine mRNA and sickness

595
00:31:49,248 --> 00:31:53,600
I don't know man I think

596
00:31:53,856 --> 00:31:54,624
The

597
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:57,440
The notion that the covid vaccines

598
00:31:57,696 --> 00:32:00,256
Give you monkeypox has a

599
00:32:00,512 --> 00:32:02,816
I've not heard that one outage

600
00:32:03,328 --> 00:32:05,888
Quite a bit of his show and this is not something that I

601
00:32:06,144 --> 00:32:07,424
I've learned to be afraid of

602
00:32:07,936 --> 00:32:09,216
Yeah that's a big swing

603
00:32:09,472 --> 00:32:15,616
Whatever is happening in the news just kind of gets to the history

604
00:32:15,872 --> 00:32:21,248
I don't know about that

605
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:24,064
Petrol midi-chlorian backstory retcon

606
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:25,344
Kind of situation

607
00:32:25,856 --> 00:32:27,392
I find it more sensitive

608
00:32:27,648 --> 00:32:28,160
Because

609
00:32:28,416 --> 00:32:29,184
You know at least

610
00:32:29,696 --> 00:32:30,720
That was just disappoint

611
00:32:30,976 --> 00:32:32,000
This is the real world

612
00:32:32,512 --> 00:32:34,304
Also this is 100%

613
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:36,096
A Cowboy Bebop episode

614
00:32:36,352 --> 00:32:37,120
These

615
00:32:37,376 --> 00:32:40,192
The eco-terrorists break-in and they have a virus

616
00:32:40,448 --> 00:32:42,752
That they're going to unleash upon planet

617
00:32:43,008 --> 00:32:45,824
Edit Progressive you evolution

618
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:47,616
Into a monkey and the way he

619
00:32:48,128 --> 00:32:48,640
Described it

620
00:32:49,152 --> 00:32:53,248
Injected you with monkey cells and having them reprogram your body

621
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:54,528
Missus missus Monk

622
00:32:54,784 --> 00:32:57,856
This is East turning people into monkey well well I would

623
00:32:58,112 --> 00:33:03,488
Say that it's important to remember that Cowboy Bebop

624
00:33:04,512 --> 00:33:05,024
Dinner

625
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:07,072
That is true that is true

626
00:33:07,584 --> 00:33:11,680
So that story about smallpox being found in a freezer was kind of a hoax

627
00:33:11,936 --> 00:33:18,080
In mid-november 2021 there were a bunch of headlines about vials being found in a lab in Pennsylvania that were late

628
00:33:18,592 --> 00:33:19,104
Smallpox

629
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:26,016
Idiots like Alex adjust report on headlines read the story at face value and they weren't listening when the CDC announce the date

630
00:33:26,272 --> 00:33:27,040
Cast of the vile

631
00:33:29,344 --> 00:33:30,112
The cause of smallpox

632
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:35,488
The vials have been labeled this way because they contained eximia which is the best

633
00:33:35,744 --> 00:33:38,560
The virus that used in the creation of the smallpox virus

634
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:40,352
But it doesn't give you smallpox

635
00:33:40,608 --> 00:33:43,936
It was poorly labeled files.

636
00:33:44,704 --> 00:33:45,472
It wasn't like

637
00:33:45,728 --> 00:33:46,496
Darryl was

638
00:33:46,752 --> 00:33:47,264
Tested

639
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:49,824
And found to be positive for being hilarious

640
00:33:51,616 --> 00:33:53,664
Gloves that day okay

641
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:57,248
That much of a hoax but it's

642
00:33:57,504 --> 00:34:01,088
You know like they didn't correct themselves and didn't

643
00:34:02,112 --> 00:34:03,392
Take the take the

644
00:34:03,648 --> 00:34:05,184
The update seriously

645
00:34:06,208 --> 00:34:07,488
I think that's fair to call it

646
00:34:07,744 --> 00:34:08,512
Somewhat of a hoax

647
00:34:08,768 --> 00:34:09,280
You know it

648
00:34:09,536 --> 00:34:12,096
It's hard not to see

649
00:34:12,352 --> 00:34:16,704
That's that Rogan clip where he's liking all this is too good for me not

650
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:20,288
How to use and then you see that behavior echoed in the main

651
00:34:20,544 --> 00:34:21,568
Stream media bore off

652
00:34:21,824 --> 00:34:22,336
And then you would like

653
00:34:22,848 --> 00:34:28,736
Well I I don't know cuz I think mode a lot of those articles will include updates or they'll like

654
00:34:28,992 --> 00:34:31,808
Behavior you see with Blake's

655
00:34:32,064 --> 00:34:32,832
But he just doesn't

656
00:34:33,856 --> 00:34:35,648
Yeah

657
00:34:35,904 --> 00:34:37,696
Don't get me wrong there's a big difference

658
00:34:41,536 --> 00:34:46,400
It's also Alex's budget details about the monkeys that escaped from that crash earlier this year

659
00:34:46,912 --> 00:34:50,496
Research monkeys but they didn't all have much

660
00:34:50,752 --> 00:34:52,032
Monkeypox Alex is making that off

661
00:34:52,288 --> 00:34:57,408
Macaque monkeys wichard actually not known to be very susceptible to monkey

662
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:58,432
Baked ham

663
00:34:59,456 --> 00:35:01,504
It's kind of rare compared to other

664
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:02,528
Species of monkey

665
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:07,392
Okay so now you're scaring me because that suggests that we're all going to get monkeypox in these

666
00:35:07,648 --> 00:35:08,160
Macaque monkey

667
00:35:08,416 --> 00:35:09,696
Will take over after we're gone

668
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:10,720
Not that's not going to happen

669
00:35:11,232 --> 00:35:17,376
Only four animals escaped from the trucks and by the next morning

670
00:35:17,632 --> 00:35:18,400
The last one that is

671
00:35:18,912 --> 00:35:20,960
On the Run

672
00:35:22,752 --> 00:35:25,824
They hadn't been absorbed by Caesar yet at 8 have enjoyed his

673
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:26,848
Gag

674
00:35:27,872 --> 00:35:32,480
That documentary is pretty good though I did see the second

675
00:35:37,856 --> 00:35:38,368
Monkeypox

676
00:35:38,624 --> 00:35:41,184
She did get sick after getting his stat by one of the Monkees

677
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:45,280
Is when she came in contact with its saliva

678
00:35:45,536 --> 00:35:48,608
She walked up to the box that it was it wasn't one of the one right

679
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:50,144
Jurassic Park Style

680
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:55,776
Yeah she got treated for rabies preemptively and she did come some mild nonspecific symptoms

681
00:35:56,544 --> 00:36:02,688
He also was at a birthday party tonight before where a bunch of people ended up testing positive for covid so there's a lot of

682
00:36:02,944 --> 00:36:05,760
She came to have whatever symptoms she had

683
00:36:06,528 --> 00:36:08,320
I don't know

684
00:36:08,576 --> 00:36:09,088
Alright

685
00:36:10,112 --> 00:36:12,928
Questions

686
00:36:13,696 --> 00:36:18,048
I was just throwing shade at the wall gear connect on connected dots in order to make

687
00:36:18,304 --> 00:36:20,096
Truly bizarre conspiracy theory

688
00:36:20,608 --> 00:36:26,752
Is AstraZeneca in the J&J vaccine cause monkeypox so many more cases than we are and

689
00:36:27,008 --> 00:36:30,080
They wouldn't have just happened

690
00:36:30,336 --> 00:36:32,384
The people have taken that shot in

691
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:35,968
Like it's a new shot in the grand scheme of things but it's not like

692
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:39,552
It just rolled out last month or whatever 2 months ago

693
00:36:39,808 --> 00:36:43,648
Yeah I think he's relying heavily on his audience not to stop and think waiting

694
00:36:44,416 --> 00:36:44,928
Haven't

695
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:49,792
Millions upon millions of people receive this vaccine already

696
00:36:50,304 --> 00:36:53,120
Are they all monkeypox

697
00:36:54,144 --> 00:36:55,424
I feel I feel like

698
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:58,240
That is a problem

699
00:37:01,056 --> 00:37:02,848
It's just like it's about like

700
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:08,480
Trying to get these amendments to the international Health regulations

701
00:37:08,992 --> 00:37:12,320
But we should be in favor of because

702
00:37:12,576 --> 00:37:13,088
Juno

703
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:17,952
Countries like China may or may not withheld information that could have been useful

704
00:37:18,208 --> 00:37:23,072
Labradorite tote so once again I for I forgot that this is all in service

705
00:37:23,328 --> 00:37:24,608
Of the UN

706
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:27,168
Eventually being able to during

707
00:37:27,424 --> 00:37:28,192
The next possible

708
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:29,984
Pandemics going double

709
00:37:30,496 --> 00:37:31,008
Check to see if

710
00:37:31,264 --> 00:37:32,032
China is lying

711
00:37:33,568 --> 00:37:34,336
Something like that

712
00:37:34,848 --> 00:37:37,152
So they're giving people smallpox

713
00:37:37,664 --> 00:37:38,944
I guess

714
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:42,016
Directions

715
00:37:42,528 --> 00:37:45,856
Savable

716
00:37:46,368 --> 00:37:46,880
DNA

717
00:37:47,392 --> 00:37:48,672
Is what causes

718
00:37:48,928 --> 00:37:49,440
Smallpox

719
00:37:51,232 --> 00:37:52,768
They're injecting people

720
00:37:53,024 --> 00:37:54,560
Where the damn smallpox

721
00:37:54,816 --> 00:37:56,608
Knowing it would cost Mall box

722
00:37:57,376 --> 00:38:00,192
Alright man

723
00:38:01,728 --> 00:38:07,872
It's wild that this is just coming up now like I thought the whole thing with the covid-19 was a gay people like Mario Kart

724
00:38:08,128 --> 00:38:10,688
Titus or whatever smallpox which is

725
00:38:10,944 --> 00:38:11,968
Escalation

726
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:15,808
They put the Monkey jeans inside of you Dad

727
00:38:16,832 --> 00:38:22,976
Because the AstraZeneca vaccine uses overconfident replication deficient

728
00:38:23,232 --> 00:38:25,280
Adenovirus Vector in order to

729
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:26,304
To deliver the vaccine

730
00:38:26,816 --> 00:38:29,888
He saw chimpanzee and then decided to run with it.

731
00:38:30,912 --> 00:38:37,056
The adenovirus is not the virus that causes smallpox that would be variola which isn't even used in the small

732
00:38:37,312 --> 00:38:37,824
Pox vaccine

733
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:39,616
Why would you do that

734
00:38:39,872 --> 00:38:43,456
Right that'll be about idea adenoviruses basically caused

735
00:38:43,712 --> 00:38:44,224
Colts

736
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:47,808
They also uses inedita virus but it's a human strain

737
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,088
Type 26

738
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:51,648
Monkey DNA

739
00:38:51,904 --> 00:38:53,184
It's a virus.

740
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:55,488
Generally effects monkeys

741
00:38:55,744 --> 00:38:56,256
Right

742
00:38:56,512 --> 00:39:01,120
Richard Madden

743
00:39:01,632 --> 00:39:07,776
Like that's the level of connection Alex is making in order to be like

744
00:39:08,032 --> 00:39:09,824
It's pathetic are also just like

745
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:10,592
Really

746
00:39:11,104 --> 00:39:12,384
Really dangerous metallic

747
00:39:13,152 --> 00:39:15,200
Yeah I I do think he does

748
00:39:15,456 --> 00:39:17,760
Understand I think it's hard to

749
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:19,552
Keep this in your mind

750
00:39:19,808 --> 00:39:20,320
Do you know it's like

751
00:39:21,088 --> 00:39:22,880
And if you have a virus that

752
00:39:23,136 --> 00:39:24,160
Causes monkeypox

753
00:39:24,672 --> 00:39:25,952
Monkey part is

754
00:39:28,256 --> 00:39:30,048
Cuz the virus can evolve outside

755
00:39:30,304 --> 00:39:31,840
Virus exist without monkey

756
00:39:32,608 --> 00:39:34,144
Can be anywhere

757
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,424
If it wants to be

758
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:36,448
I mean I don't know if it has

759
00:39:36,704 --> 00:39:38,752
Maybe maybe maybe that's

760
00:39:39,008 --> 00:39:43,360
Hard for you to keep in your mind because you got the vaccine they do our part month

761
00:39:43,616 --> 00:39:46,688
Okay now

762
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,552
Close enough

763
00:39:51,808 --> 00:39:52,576
Genetically

764
00:39:52,832 --> 00:39:57,184
That all of our vaccines were more lizard based and I got regenerative powers on top

765
00:39:57,952 --> 00:39:58,976
I want that

766
00:39:59,232 --> 00:40:01,792
Bill Gates is working on that

767
00:40:02,048 --> 00:40:02,560
High hopes

768
00:40:02,816 --> 00:40:07,168
Because as we know they'll often times the devil is depicted as sort of

769
00:40:07,424 --> 00:40:07,936
Lizard

770
00:40:09,728 --> 00:40:14,848
Then out but isn't he using it to give himself regenerative properties and then leave the

771
00:40:15,104 --> 00:40:17,152
Planet and that's probably how he's going to be able to breathe and see

772
00:40:17,408 --> 00:40:17,920
Space that ass

773
00:40:18,176 --> 00:40:19,456
Castle yeah

774
00:40:19,712 --> 00:40:22,784
Emeryville leave us all live monkeys

775
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:27,648
Probably be happier God this is just

776
00:40:29,696 --> 00:40:30,720
I understand

777
00:40:31,488 --> 00:40:34,816
To be fair this situation with monkeypox is something that is not

778
00:40:35,328 --> 00:40:36,096
To be taken like

779
00:40:36,352 --> 00:40:37,376
Superlite

780
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:43,264
Officials tracing

781
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:44,544
The case isn't

782
00:40:45,056 --> 00:40:46,848
They're on the case

783
00:40:47,616 --> 00:40:48,640
What Alex is doing

784
00:40:48,896 --> 00:40:50,688
Is laughable and

785
00:40:50,944 --> 00:40:51,456
Just

786
00:40:51,712 --> 00:40:52,224
Pathetic

787
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:52,992
Right

788
00:40:53,248 --> 00:40:55,040
And what's important is that the rest

789
00:40:55,552 --> 00:40:56,576
Conservative media is

790
00:40:56,832 --> 00:40:59,392
Is not using a monkeypox fear to bring

791
00:40:59,648 --> 00:41:00,160
Fascism

792
00:41:06,304 --> 00:41:10,144
Plague basically

793
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:11,168
According to Alex

794
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:12,960
But if you just

795
00:41:13,216 --> 00:41:14,496
Call your friends or family

796
00:41:14,752 --> 00:41:15,520
Uno

797
00:41:22,944 --> 00:41:24,992
What is a birthday

798
00:41:25,248 --> 00:41:26,016
Begun

799
00:41:26,784 --> 00:41:27,296
Monkey paw

800
00:41:36,256 --> 00:41:36,768
J&J

801
00:41:43,936 --> 00:41:44,448
It is

802
00:41:44,704 --> 00:41:45,216
Going

803
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:54,943
What really obvious even responded

804
00:41:55,199 --> 00:41:55,967
Please connect me to the

805
00:41:57,503 --> 00:42:03,647
Evil villains is going to watch a smallpox outbreak in order to possibly win a few seats in the

806
00:42:04,671 --> 00:42:06,207
It's so f****** stupid

807
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:15,935
About whether or not

808
00:42:16,191 --> 00:42:20,543
GOP takes back the Senate

809
00:42:21,055 --> 00:42:27,199
Listen we need two more senators and that means roughly several million people got to die that's just

810
00:42:27,455 --> 00:42:27,967
Politics work

811
00:42:28,479 --> 00:42:31,807
Release that has like

812
00:42:32,831 --> 00:42:36,159
Possibility of getting so out of control that it it

813
00:42:36,415 --> 00:42:37,695
Kills everybody

814
00:42:37,951 --> 00:42:39,487
The elites

815
00:42:39,743 --> 00:42:44,351
That are behind this plan so dumb

816
00:42:44,607 --> 00:42:45,119
Stupid

817
00:42:45,375 --> 00:42:46,911
It's not a general election

818
00:42:48,447 --> 00:42:48,959
So like

819
00:42:49,215 --> 00:42:50,751
All of Spain gets monkey

820
00:42:51,007 --> 00:42:52,799
Fox because they got a Wyndham Midtown

821
00:42:53,055 --> 00:42:55,615
We got to keep Laura Loomer out of Congress

822
00:43:00,735 --> 00:43:02,015
Just ridiculous

823
00:43:02,527 --> 00:43:08,671
It's interesting that Alex brings up how you didn't hear much out of China in the early days of

824
00:43:09,183 --> 00:43:15,327
The amendment to the World Health Organization regulations that he's demonizing is actually designed to make sure the future outbreaks

825
00:43:15,583 --> 00:43:16,863
Don't have that same dynamic

826
00:43:18,399 --> 00:43:18,911
But I don't think he would

827
00:43:19,423 --> 00:43:21,471
Probably I mean that you can't have

828
00:43:21,727 --> 00:43:24,543
Un soldiers just going anywhere that they want to

829
00:43:24,799 --> 00:43:26,591
Do you know cuz there's so many fun

830
00:43:27,103 --> 00:43:28,127
Un soldiers

831
00:43:28,383 --> 00:43:28,895
Stegall around

832
00:43:29,151 --> 00:43:29,663
Somebody

833
00:43:29,919 --> 00:43:30,431
Somebody

834
00:43:30,943 --> 00:43:34,271
Except some Bill Gates clips

835
00:43:34,527 --> 00:43:36,063
Let's help him prove his point

836
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:37,343
And

837
00:43:38,367 --> 00:43:40,415
Helpful

838
00:43:48,095 --> 00:43:50,399
He also said other programs

839
00:43:51,935 --> 00:43:52,447
Wood

840
00:43:52,703 --> 00:43:53,215
Call Chevrolet

841
00:43:53,983 --> 00:43:54,751
Smallpox Armonk

842
00:43:55,007 --> 00:43:56,287
NBC

843
00:43:56,799 --> 00:43:57,823
Weird are the clips

844
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:01,919
The team most explicitly in line with the b******* Alex's saying aren't the ones he plays

845
00:44:02,175 --> 00:44:08,319
But we're David Dynamic always seems to be present tells the audience about those ones and then plays other Calypso don't really

846
00:44:08,575 --> 00:44:09,599
Make the points in each of them to

847
00:44:09,855 --> 00:44:10,879
That's weird almost

848
00:44:11,135 --> 00:44:12,159
Like he's making s*** up

849
00:44:12,671 --> 00:44:14,719
You know I mean you do it one or two times

850
00:44:14,975 --> 00:44:16,255
Hey that's that happen

851
00:44:16,767 --> 00:44:17,279
That's a mistake

852
00:44:17,535 --> 00:44:18,303
I think when you make a call

853
00:44:18,559 --> 00:44:21,375
Career out of it it might be a bit of a red flag

854
00:44:26,239 --> 00:44:30,079
Izzy says Gates was threatening that the attention

855
00:44:30,591 --> 00:44:33,663
That seems weird cuz this one's gotten a whole lot of attention

856
00:44:34,175 --> 00:44:39,551
The actual clip

857
00:44:39,807 --> 00:44:42,111
And see if you can tell where the LIE is

858
00:44:43,647 --> 00:44:44,415
Here is Bill Gates

859
00:44:45,695 --> 00:44:46,207
We didn't

860
00:44:48,255 --> 00:44:49,023
Listen to think about

861
00:44:49,535 --> 00:44:50,559
Okay what about

862
00:44:51,327 --> 00:44:52,863
Nursing homes what about

863
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:53,631
Getting fat

864
00:44:54,911 --> 00:44:55,423
The testing

865
00:44:56,959 --> 00:44:58,495
The testing could have been ramped up

866
00:44:59,007 --> 00:45:00,287
Very quickly

867
00:45:00,799 --> 00:45:01,567
A few countries

868
00:45:04,895 --> 00:45:05,663
Entirely like

869
00:45:07,711 --> 00:45:09,503
Taiwan New Zealand Australia

870
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:14,879
And so they moved a lot fast

871
00:45:24,351 --> 00:45:25,119
Will get it

872
00:45:25,375 --> 00:45:25,887
This time

873
00:45:30,495 --> 00:45:32,799
So yeah doodoo see why the lie was there

874
00:45:35,103 --> 00:45:37,663
Bill Gates's saying we'll get attention

875
00:45:40,735 --> 00:45:46,879
You specifically said at the beginning to the variable of like nursing homes in

876
00:45:47,135 --> 00:45:48,159
And stuff like that

877
00:45:49,183 --> 00:45:52,255
Factors that we missed

878
00:45:52,511 --> 00:45:55,327
In the course of this public health response

879
00:45:55,839 --> 00:45:56,863
That would get attention

880
00:45:57,375 --> 00:45:59,167
In the case of a future

881
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:00,703
Public Health

882
00:46:00,959 --> 00:46:02,495
Urgency

883
00:46:03,007 --> 00:46:05,823
No I'm pretty sure what he was trying to say is that neck

884
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:06,847
Time in the neck

885
00:46:07,103 --> 00:46:08,383
Few years when this would happen

886
00:46:08,895 --> 00:46:13,247
The New York Times will finally cover the story right

887
00:46:13,503 --> 00:46:14,527
Time that the

888
00:46:14,783 --> 00:46:16,319
Pandemic got Salma tent

889
00:46:16,831 --> 00:46:18,879
Lego Ruiz expectant CNN to get

890
00:46:19,135 --> 00:46:23,743
Right that's thirsty

891
00:46:23,999 --> 00:46:25,279
Brickmania

892
00:46:25,535 --> 00:46:26,815
Need to get on the ball

893
00:46:28,095 --> 00:46:28,863
Ridiculous

894
00:46:29,887 --> 00:46:34,239
Yeah Alex seems to be

895
00:46:34,751 --> 00:46:37,055
Lying about this Bill Gates clip

896
00:46:39,871 --> 00:46:40,383
Yeah

897
00:46:40,895 --> 00:46:41,919
And he continues to

898
00:46:42,175 --> 00:46:47,295
Alex Goes a little bit more into this

899
00:46:47,551 --> 00:46:49,343
Makes up some more stuff about monkeypox

900
00:46:54,463 --> 00:46:55,487
When will really

901
00:46:56,255 --> 00:46:56,767
Get

902
00:47:02,655 --> 00:47:03,935
Alright on

903
00:47:04,959 --> 00:47:05,727
Like a German train

904
00:47:10,335 --> 00:47:12,895
Right on time Western world

905
00:47:13,663 --> 00:47:14,431
Monkeypox

906
00:47:14,943 --> 00:47:15,455
Showed up

907
00:47:15,711 --> 00:47:16,223
Who

908
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:24,159
Is it Mussolini made the trains run on time

909
00:47:24,415 --> 00:47:26,463
Well he famously made one

910
00:47:27,743 --> 00:47:29,791
Expression about Italy

911
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:34,143
At least at least he made the trains run on time

912
00:47:35,167 --> 00:47:36,703
I don't believe that Alex

913
00:47:36,959 --> 00:47:42,079
Has this little ability to understand the words he's hearing like in terms of Bill Gates

914
00:47:44,383 --> 00:47:47,711
Gates was because

915
00:47:47,967 --> 00:47:50,015
Is easier to scare the audience that way

916
00:47:50,271 --> 00:47:51,551
He knows what he's doing

917
00:47:52,831 --> 00:47:55,647
Malicious liar

918
00:47:58,719 --> 00:48:00,255
Relax

919
00:48:00,511 --> 00:48:03,583
Do the next 10 get your attention

920
00:48:04,095 --> 00:48:05,119
My bad

921
00:48:06,143 --> 00:48:07,935
We got plenty of attention

922
00:48:08,191 --> 00:48:14,335
Okay

923
00:48:15,871 --> 00:48:21,247
Absolutely zero idea whether or not the people who have got monkeypox are vaccinated

924
00:48:21,759 --> 00:48:27,391
He's making that up that they are because his new conspiracy depends on that being true but he couldn't

925
00:48:27,647 --> 00:48:29,183
What state is Clemson

926
00:48:29,951 --> 00:48:36,095
There's a decent chance just based on percentages

927
00:48:37,631 --> 00:48:40,959
Way harder if you wants to climb through some sort of causation here

928
00:48:41,215 --> 00:48:43,519
Which is definitely the trees bark enough

929
00:48:44,031 --> 00:48:47,103
Yeah and isn't it also just like a 100 people

930
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:48,895
It's not a ton of people

931
00:48:49,151 --> 00:48:50,175
Alright

932
00:48:50,431 --> 00:48:53,759
Again a ton of people have been vaccinated with all kinds of x

933
00:48:54,271 --> 00:49:00,415
There's a pretty decent chance that it is a little bit more than that

934
00:49:00,671 --> 00:49:03,487
Confirmed cases as of the preparation this episode

935
00:49:03,743 --> 00:49:05,023
According to

936
00:49:05,535 --> 00:49:06,815
World Health Organization

937
00:49:07,071 --> 00:49:13,215
Countries that have different vaccines

938
00:49:13,471 --> 00:49:17,311
Proved difficult

939
00:49:18,335 --> 00:49:21,919
Meredith make stick in any audience that's not Alex's audience

940
00:49:22,175 --> 00:49:22,687
That's cuz

941
00:49:22,943 --> 00:49:25,759
He's trained them to believe whatever dumb she says

942
00:49:26,271 --> 00:49:26,783
Yeah

943
00:49:27,039 --> 00:49:29,087
There's no way that you hear that

944
00:49:29,343 --> 00:49:30,111
As a rational person

945
00:49:30,623 --> 00:49:31,391
Not go like

946
00:49:32,159 --> 00:49:34,207
Hold on

947
00:49:34,719 --> 00:49:40,351
About any one of the many things you can sell many variables that you should take issue with

948
00:49:41,887 --> 00:49:45,215
Alex is talking about this monkeypox

949
00:49:45,471 --> 00:49:46,495
Situation

950
00:49:46,751 --> 00:49:48,287
He makes a bizarre leap

951
00:49:48,543 --> 00:49:53,151
Because I take it he's running out of ground

952
00:49:53,407 --> 00:49:54,431
Right right right

953
00:49:54,687 --> 00:49:57,247
Out of ground under his feet

954
00:49:58,527 --> 00:49:59,807
To something else which is weird

955
00:50:13,631 --> 00:50:14,399
Help

956
00:50:17,983 --> 00:50:19,775
Madrid

957
00:50:28,991 --> 00:50:29,503
Weird

958
00:50:29,759 --> 00:50:33,855
Monkeypox is caused by

959
00:50:34,111 --> 00:50:35,647
Still talking about hepatitis case

960
00:50:35,903 --> 00:50:39,743
All diseases are caused by the covid vaccine

961
00:50:40,255 --> 00:50:46,399
DirecTV has a trick he uses to distract the audience and make them think that he's proven something

962
00:50:46,655 --> 00:50:48,191
But in reality he hasn't said s***

963
00:50:48,959 --> 00:50:54,591
Hepatitis but the World Health Organization

964
00:50:54,847 --> 00:50:56,895
The vast majority of affected

965
00:50:57,151 --> 00:51:00,479
Did children did not receive covid-19 vaccinations

966
00:51:02,271 --> 00:51:08,415
Also reporting on about the deputy Public Health minister in Madrid Gateway pundit

967
00:51:08,927 --> 00:51:09,439
Actually

968
00:51:09,695 --> 00:51:10,463
Completely wrong

969
00:51:11,231 --> 00:51:15,839
The minister in question Antonio's Arrowhead actually said the opposite

970
00:51:16,095 --> 00:51:20,959
Media reports linking the vaccine to hepatitis

971
00:51:21,215 --> 00:51:25,055
The Spanish Health Ministry released a

972
00:51:25,311 --> 00:51:31,455
Clarification because

973
00:51:33,247 --> 00:51:34,015
Almost

974
00:51:34,271 --> 00:51:35,807
I like if you're distant

975
00:51:36,063 --> 00:51:36,575
Information

976
00:51:36,831 --> 00:51:37,599
And you're just

977
00:51:37,855 --> 00:51:38,367
Feelinspiffy

978
00:51:38,623 --> 00:51:40,159
Hear somebody's like

979
00:51:40,415 --> 00:51:40,927
Listen

980
00:51:41,183 --> 00:51:46,303
This is something that's important and I don't like the media twisting our claim so they like f*** you

981
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:47,583
We're going to put those claims

982
00:51:47,839 --> 00:51:53,215
Good job Jim hoft or his twin brother I don't remember who I was responsible for writing that one

983
00:51:54,239 --> 00:51:54,751
Yeah it's

984
00:51:55,007 --> 00:51:56,799
It's just it's it's bad work

985
00:51:57,311 --> 00:51:57,823
It's bad word

986
00:51:58,079 --> 00:52:00,895
Do we have dinner

987
00:52:02,431 --> 00:52:05,247
I guess monkeypox fears that the covid-19

988
00:52:06,527 --> 00:52:11,135
Somehow by pointing to a completely inaccurate story Lincoln covid-19

989
00:52:11,391 --> 00:52:12,159
Hepatitis

990
00:52:13,439 --> 00:52:15,743
But there's a condition you should know about

991
00:52:15,999 --> 00:52:18,303
I mentioned earlier

992
00:52:19,839 --> 00:52:21,119
Meningitis

993
00:52:24,447 --> 00:52:26,751
A case study of a single person

994
00:52:27,007 --> 00:52:29,055
Who got meningitis after vaccination

995
00:52:29,567 --> 00:52:32,895
There's not a causal link established but I was able to find a second

996
00:52:33,151 --> 00:52:37,503
Case study covering two patients which recommends this phenomenon

997
00:52:37,759 --> 00:52:39,295
But doesn't say that the vaccine

998
00:52:39,551 --> 00:52:40,063
Call Dad

999
00:52:40,575 --> 00:52:46,463
Also all the patients that are in question made a full recovery with no residual neurological deficits

1000
00:52:46,719 --> 00:52:48,255
The study does nothing

1001
00:52:48,511 --> 00:52:50,303
The further Alex is clams and it's

1002
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:51,583
Not related

1003
00:52:52,607 --> 00:52:53,375
Hepatitis

1004
00:52:56,191 --> 00:52:57,983
This is just like

1005
00:52:58,239 --> 00:53:04,383
Just a Max bouillabaisse

1006
00:53:04,639 --> 00:53:06,431
Stop everything

1007
00:53:06,943 --> 00:53:07,967
Deputy health

1008
00:53:08,223 --> 00:53:09,759
Direct

1009
00:53:10,015 --> 00:53:11,295
Venezuela

1010
00:53:11,807 --> 00:53:12,319
Said that

1011
00:53:12,575 --> 00:53:14,367
All broken legs

1012
00:53:19,231 --> 00:53:20,255
You get the shot at

1013
00:53:20,511 --> 00:53:21,791
Boom your left tibia

1014
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:23,327
Breakthrough cast

1015
00:53:23,839 --> 00:53:24,351
All gone

1016
00:53:24,607 --> 00:53:30,495
Are two different headlines about that same meningitis case study

1017
00:53:30,751 --> 00:53:32,031
Stories

1018
00:53:32,287 --> 00:53:35,359
To study plants to study

1019
00:53:35,615 --> 00:53:39,199
In his list of studies he's

1020
00:53:44,319 --> 00:53:45,087
Girl

1021
00:53:46,367 --> 00:53:47,135
Does Sean

1022
00:53:48,927 --> 00:53:49,439
Stealing

1023
00:53:50,719 --> 00:53:51,743
None

1024
00:53:51,999 --> 00:53:52,767
Believable

1025
00:53:53,279 --> 00:53:59,423
This isn't a study and the article itself doesn't backup Alex's claims this is from the Australian

1026
00:53:59,679 --> 00:54:00,959
Government Health Website

1027
00:54:01,215 --> 00:54:07,103
The AstraZeneca vaccine doesn't contain animal DNA it uses an adenovirus that infects champ

1028
00:54:07,359 --> 00:54:09,919
But that's not the same thing

1029
00:54:10,431 --> 00:54:16,575
The article doesn't backup Alex's claims at all but the headline contains all the Daleks

1030
00:54:18,367 --> 00:54:19,903
Care what the actual article says

1031
00:54:20,415 --> 00:54:22,975
Alex answers the question in the headline for them

1032
00:54:23,231 --> 00:54:27,327
It makes both what the source Alex's using actually says

1033
00:54:28,095 --> 00:54:34,239
The real Amanda says that the article goes on to lay it all out is because

1034
00:54:34,495 --> 00:54:40,383
And he realizes in the middle of that the article concerts tips

1035
00:54:40,895 --> 00:54:43,199
Whenever you hear him say it goes on

1036
00:54:43,455 --> 00:54:49,599
He doesn't know the information he's and probably what he's about

1037
00:54:49,855 --> 00:54:51,647
How to read accidentally

1038
00:54:51,903 --> 00:54:53,439
Counter to his entire narrative

1039
00:54:53,951 --> 00:54:54,975
Let me tell you something

1040
00:54:55,487 --> 00:54:57,279
This is going to be released

1041
00:54:57,535 --> 00:54:58,047
Scary zalae

1042
00:54:58,559 --> 00:54:59,071
I'm going to this is go

1043
00:55:00,095 --> 00:55:00,607
Alright

1044
00:55:00,863 --> 00:55:01,887
You already

1045
00:55:02,143 --> 00:55:02,655
We have

1046
00:55:03,167 --> 00:55:04,191
Gdna inside

1047
00:55:04,447 --> 00:55:04,959
Body

1048
00:55:05,215 --> 00:55:05,983
A lot of it

1049
00:55:06,751 --> 00:55:07,519
Almost

1050
00:55:07,775 --> 00:55:08,799
All of it

1051
00:55:09,311 --> 00:55:10,335
Where monkeys

1052
00:55:10,591 --> 00:55:11,359
No way man

1053
00:55:11,871 --> 00:55:13,407
No way man

1054
00:55:13,663 --> 00:55:19,807
Where is that saying f****** s*** man to be fair Alex does not believe in Ewa

1055
00:55:20,063 --> 00:55:21,599
Solution so he probably

1056
00:55:22,367 --> 00:55:24,159
Probably would have disagree with you on that

1057
00:55:25,183 --> 00:55:31,327
Look we already know now that's the race war narratives and the race war lockdown

1058
00:55:31,583 --> 00:55:32,863
Sounds

1059
00:55:33,631 --> 00:55:35,167
You know really concerned about

1060
00:55:35,423 --> 00:55:36,191
Earlier

1061
00:55:36,447 --> 00:55:36,959
In the week

1062
00:55:37,471 --> 00:55:38,751
Disappeared

1063
00:55:39,007 --> 00:55:40,031
Because there's a

1064
00:55:41,055 --> 00:55:41,823
Public Health

1065
00:55:42,079 --> 00:55:43,615
Lockdown stuff is

1066
00:55:43,871 --> 00:55:47,711
Is more pressing now this is the biggest news that Alex is covered in his 28 years on air

1067
00:55:48,223 --> 00:55:48,991
Even though it's

1068
00:55:49,247 --> 00:55:50,783
Something that he is already covered

1069
00:55:51,039 --> 00:55:52,319
Back in 2003

1070
00:55:52,575 --> 00:55:53,855
And it fizzled out

1071
00:55:54,111 --> 00:55:55,135
Because he was lying about it

1072
00:55:56,671 --> 00:56:01,791
So we have no race war lockdowns but it turns out Alex is retaining some

1073
00:56:02,047 --> 00:56:05,119
Pieces of his coverage of the Buffalo shooting

1074
00:56:07,935 --> 00:56:08,447
That's what I was

1075
00:56:09,215 --> 00:56:09,983
Who's the top

1076
00:56:10,239 --> 00:56:12,287
Global famine

1077
00:56:12,543 --> 00:56:14,335
Armageddon

1078
00:56:15,359 --> 00:56:16,639
And apocalyptic user quote

1079
00:56:17,663 --> 00:56:19,199
Proportions all Bass

1080
00:56:19,455 --> 00:56:20,479
Based on the two plus year

1081
00:56:20,735 --> 00:56:21,247
Lockdown

1082
00:56:24,575 --> 00:56:25,343
Ordered them

1083
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:26,367
2 years locked

1084
00:56:26,879 --> 00:56:27,391
Devastating

1085
00:56:27,903 --> 00:56:28,671
Ordered them

1086
00:56:29,183 --> 00:56:30,719
40 + million starve to death

1087
00:56:31,487 --> 00:56:33,023
The refugees are flooding the last

1088
00:56:33,791 --> 00:56:35,839
As far as a replacement migration operation

1089
00:56:37,631 --> 00:56:38,143
So

1090
00:56:39,167 --> 00:56:39,935
Scott darling

1091
00:56:40,447 --> 00:56:41,727
Wow I would hate it if they can

1092
00:56:41,983 --> 00:56:42,495
Kept using great

1093
00:56:42,751 --> 00:56:45,055
Replacement Theory I do I do appreciate

1094
00:56:45,311 --> 00:56:46,079
Updating at 2

1095
00:56:46,591 --> 00:56:47,615
Rmo

1096
00:56:51,199 --> 00:56:52,223
There is there's

1097
00:56:52,479 --> 00:56:54,015
Plan in place

1098
00:56:55,551 --> 00:56:57,343
Pointing to

1099
00:56:57,599 --> 00:56:58,623
Replacement

1100
00:56:59,903 --> 00:57:01,951
I mean I think

1101
00:57:02,975 --> 00:57:03,999
It's notable

1102
00:57:04,255 --> 00:57:07,327
The hateful elements of his

1103
00:57:07,839 --> 00:57:10,399
Is Buffalo shooting coverage

1104
00:57:10,655 --> 00:57:12,703
While the fear-based

1105
00:57:12,959 --> 00:57:15,519
Do you want the audience to engage with

1106
00:57:15,775 --> 00:57:17,311
Have shifted over to

1107
00:57:18,079 --> 00:57:21,151
The other camp

1108
00:57:21,407 --> 00:57:23,967
Where is he now the flavors different it it's the same food

1109
00:57:24,991 --> 00:57:25,759
You can't reheat it

1110
00:57:27,295 --> 00:57:27,807
It's just

1111
00:57:28,063 --> 00:57:29,087
It's just

1112
00:57:29,855 --> 00:57:33,439
But it's not I mean it's it's

1113
00:57:33,951 --> 00:57:35,231
That's just what I was.

1114
00:57:36,511 --> 00:57:40,095
We're we're too late in this game to be shocked by this anymore

1115
00:57:41,119 --> 00:57:45,727
So I'm going on in social media land over the course of

1116
00:57:46,239 --> 00:57:48,799
Last week or so has been that Elon Musk

1117
00:57:51,871 --> 00:57:52,639
Shenanigans

1118
00:57:52,895 --> 00:57:53,663
Oh man

1119
00:57:53,919 --> 00:57:54,687
That guy

1120
00:57:55,199 --> 00:57:55,711
Little boy

1121
00:57:56,223 --> 00:58:02,367
So I was going to vote Republican and then he says

1122
00:58:03,391 --> 00:58:06,719
America East attacks on him would intensify

1123
00:58:06,975 --> 00:58:07,999
And then it turned out

1124
00:58:08,255 --> 00:58:10,559
I'm making those tweets

1125
00:58:10,815 --> 00:58:12,095
Someone had reached out

1126
00:58:12,351 --> 00:58:14,399
About allegations that

1127
00:58:14,655 --> 00:58:15,679
Exposed himself to

1128
00:58:19,263 --> 00:58:24,383
Why do people putting some pieces together and thinking hey maybe maybe this whole thing about

1129
00:58:24,639 --> 00:58:26,175
Denovo

1130
00:58:26,687 --> 00:58:30,783
The attacks against

1131
00:58:32,319 --> 00:58:33,599
Servicenow

1132
00:58:33,855 --> 00:58:34,879
To get ahead of a story

1133
00:58:35,135 --> 00:58:36,159
Maybe

1134
00:58:36,415 --> 00:58:38,719
I just don't understand are you saying that and

1135
00:58:38,975 --> 00:58:43,839
Unimaginably wealthy man with absolute zero accountability

1136
00:58:44,095 --> 00:58:44,863
Took

1137
00:58:45,119 --> 00:58:46,655
Advantage of a

1138
00:58:47,167 --> 00:58:48,447
Defenseless woman that seems

1139
00:58:48,703 --> 00:58:49,471
Crazy

1140
00:58:49,983 --> 00:58:50,495
Is that

1141
00:58:52,031 --> 00:58:54,335
There are allegations and

1142
00:58:54,847 --> 00:59:00,991
Obviously I don't know all the ins and outs and all the details of everything but I would say that Elon musk's

1143
00:59:01,247 --> 00:59:02,015
Behavior is

1144
00:59:02,783 --> 00:59:03,551
Not come off

1145
00:59:03,807 --> 00:59:05,087
Great

1146
00:59:06,111 --> 00:59:09,183
It seems like the WhatsApp

1147
00:59:09,439 --> 00:59:11,999
Much like someone who's guilty

1148
00:59:17,631 --> 00:59:18,399
He is blameless

1149
00:59:18,911 --> 00:59:25,055
Alex has a bit of a different perspective on this and seems to think that

1150
00:59:25,311 --> 00:59:26,079
Elon Musk is

1151
00:59:26,335 --> 00:59:28,383
Totally cool and absolutely

1152
00:59:32,735 --> 00:59:33,503
He said

1153
00:59:37,599 --> 00:59:39,135
They're going to do the me to thing

1154
00:59:44,767 --> 00:59:45,535
Tell me this

1155
00:59:51,423 --> 00:59:53,471
To punish him because he says

1156
00:59:54,495 --> 00:59:55,775
Republican we got all

1157
00:59:56,031 --> 00:59:56,543
Baton

1158
00:59:56,799 --> 00:59:57,823
So much more what's going to happen

1159
00:59:58,079 --> 00:59:58,591
Biden

1160
00:59:58,847 --> 01:00:04,991
Elon musk's

1161
01:00:05,247 --> 01:00:06,783
Assertive self

1162
01:00:07,039 --> 01:00:07,551
Defense

1163
01:00:07,807 --> 01:00:08,831
Should not

1164
01:00:09,343 --> 01:00:09,855
This easy

1165
01:00:10,623 --> 01:00:11,135
And it's

1166
01:00:11,391 --> 01:00:11,903
Holy

1167
01:00:13,951 --> 01:00:18,303
Yeah no no I mean just the hole that the whole conservatives

1168
01:00:18,815 --> 01:00:21,119
I'd like it that's that is a smartwatch

1169
01:00:21,375 --> 01:00:23,423
To try and evade accountability in the

1170
01:00:23,679 --> 01:00:24,191
The court of public

1171
01:00:24,447 --> 01:00:25,727
The pain is just suddenly be like

1172
01:00:25,983 --> 01:00:28,287
Hey I'm right wing and they're attacking the right wing

1173
01:00:28,543 --> 01:00:33,663
It has nothing to do with being held accountable for my shity behavior listen up you dumb Army of

1174
01:00:33,919 --> 01:00:34,431
Boron

1175
01:00:34,687 --> 01:00:35,967
Come to my Aid

1176
01:00:36,223 --> 01:00:37,247
They took two second

1177
01:00:37,503 --> 01:00:42,879
Rich person said he's voting Republican

1178
01:00:43,135 --> 01:00:46,207
Do all of you need to get involved oh my God

1179
01:00:46,463 --> 01:00:47,487
Jesus

1180
01:00:47,743 --> 01:00:49,535
Christ yeah yeah it's

1181
01:00:49,791 --> 01:00:53,119
It's bizarre to to sort of see that

1182
01:00:53,631 --> 01:00:56,191
Play out as publicly and sort of

1183
01:00:56,447 --> 01:00:58,239
Transparently as it has

1184
01:01:01,311 --> 01:01:02,847
Sort of bewildered by that

1185
01:01:03,359 --> 01:01:06,943
Pruitt

1186
01:01:07,199 --> 01:01:07,967
Is

1187
01:01:08,735 --> 01:01:09,759
It's upsetting

1188
01:01:10,271 --> 01:01:13,855
I mean anytime at this place now where it's just like learning

1189
01:01:15,135 --> 01:01:16,159
Dumb as a concept

1190
01:01:16,671 --> 01:01:18,207
Learning doesn't happen anymore

1191
01:01:18,719 --> 01:01:19,743
People only make

1192
01:01:20,255 --> 01:01:20,767
Exact same

1193
01:01:21,023 --> 01:01:22,303
Mistake over and over and over

1194
01:01:23,071 --> 01:01:23,583
It's almost

1195
01:01:23,839 --> 01:01:25,631
Comforting now to know that people will

1196
01:01:25,887 --> 01:01:26,399
Fuk up

1197
01:01:26,655 --> 01:01:27,423
In the same way

1198
01:01:30,239 --> 01:01:31,519
Well I mean that's

1199
01:01:31,775 --> 01:01:35,871
Because our Public Health people need to take a note

1200
01:01:36,127 --> 01:01:38,943
This precaution

1201
01:01:39,711 --> 01:01:42,271
So Alex does not end up being correct

1202
01:01:42,527 --> 01:01:45,087
About

1203
01:01:46,367 --> 01:01:49,439
Alex has some guests on on this episode

1204
01:01:49,695 --> 01:01:50,975
The first one

1205
01:01:51,231 --> 01:01:53,791
Is little lawyer buddy of his

1206
01:01:54,815 --> 01:01:56,095
Bobby Barnes

1207
01:01:56,351 --> 01:01:58,399
Ralph Lauren

1208
01:02:01,215 --> 01:02:05,567
He also thinks that the monkeypox going to be big deal

1209
01:02:05,823 --> 01:02:07,871
What is your view on what's currently happening

1210
01:02:08,639 --> 01:02:11,455
It's pretty obvious lockdown the next big rollout

1211
01:02:17,599 --> 01:02:19,903
Is the smallpox

1212
01:02:20,415 --> 01:02:22,463
I'm predicting is going to go ahead and play out of

1213
01:02:28,095 --> 01:02:34,239
Smallpox hysteria now we're here with all this

1214
01:02:34,495 --> 01:02:37,055
Latest covid You Name It We got it where you're one

1215
01:02:37,311 --> 01:02:37,823
One Stop Shop

1216
01:02:38,079 --> 01:02:44,223
Not going to listen to a ton of barnes's interview but it should be noted that a lot of it is him talking about

1217
01:02:44,479 --> 01:02:49,087
He's working with Robert Kennedy Jr to do like litigation against

1218
01:02:49,343 --> 01:02:50,367
Got the vaccine

1219
01:02:50,879 --> 01:02:53,183
Stop it.

1220
01:02:53,439 --> 01:02:57,535
Maybe you have a little bit of a biased perspective on that

1221
01:02:57,791 --> 01:03:01,375
For people to donate money to that won't go anywhere

1222
01:03:01,631 --> 01:03:04,703
I'm only legal Griff

1223
01:03:04,959 --> 01:03:06,495
Good times good times

1224
01:03:07,263 --> 01:03:09,823
The other guest has a Duo

1225
01:03:11,103 --> 01:03:13,151
And it's Peter McCullough

1226
01:03:13,407 --> 01:03:15,967
Who's the big a back doctor

1227
01:03:16,223 --> 01:03:16,991
And

1228
01:03:17,247 --> 01:03:19,295
A guy named John Leake

1229
01:03:20,063 --> 01:03:20,831
Who's an author

1230
01:03:21,343 --> 01:03:26,207
And the 1st of this interview is that John Leake

1231
01:03:26,463 --> 01:03:27,487
Has written a book

1232
01:03:27,743 --> 01:03:28,511
About McCulloch

1233
01:03:29,023 --> 01:03:32,351
Call the courage to stand up for the courage to fight

1234
01:03:32,607 --> 01:03:34,399
Covid-19 or something like that

1235
01:03:35,679 --> 01:03:37,471
And here's the here's the situation

1236
01:03:38,751 --> 01:03:41,055
I find this to be a fairly damning

1237
01:03:41,311 --> 01:03:42,335
Ebook

1238
01:03:42,847 --> 01:03:43,359
Exist

1239
01:03:43,615 --> 01:03:44,895
Also

1240
01:03:45,151 --> 01:03:46,431
Okay interview

1241
01:03:46,687 --> 01:03:47,455
Because

1242
01:03:47,967 --> 01:03:49,503
This leaked guy

1243
01:03:49,759 --> 01:03:52,319
He fancies himself a true crime author

1244
01:03:52,831 --> 01:03:55,647
And so the perspective that he took

1245
01:03:55,903 --> 01:04:00,511
MBM 3.4 him in terms of covering covid-19 was as a

1246
01:04:00,767 --> 01:04:02,047
True crime stories

1247
01:04:02,559 --> 01:04:04,863
And then he involve Peter McCullough in

1248
01:04:05,119 --> 01:04:06,655
To help him with the

1249
01:04:06,911 --> 01:04:08,703
Like scientific aspects of

1250
01:04:10,495 --> 01:04:16,639
You have a guy who's interested in writing a book from a true-crime angle about the covid vaccine

1251
01:04:17,151 --> 01:04:18,943
And the main subject of his book

1252
01:04:19,199 --> 01:04:22,015
Is this Peter guy who's going around

1253
01:04:22,527 --> 01:04:23,039
Apeirogon

1254
01:04:23,295 --> 01:04:23,807
Tucker

1255
01:04:24,063 --> 01:04:26,879
Appearing on Laura Ingraham show appeared with

1256
01:04:27,135 --> 01:04:28,159
Joe Rogan

1257
01:04:28,415 --> 01:04:29,183
Grill

1258
01:04:29,695 --> 01:04:35,071
So if he doesn't have the perspective that this is a true crime kind of vibe

1259
01:04:35,583 --> 01:04:36,863
What did I do for his book

1260
01:04:38,143 --> 01:04:40,959
But they're working to release

1261
01:04:41,215 --> 01:04:41,983
Declarative

1262
01:04:42,239 --> 01:04:44,287
It kind of looks a little bit

1263
01:04:45,311 --> 01:04:48,895
Well I mean I would say that

1264
01:04:49,151 --> 01:04:49,663
A true

1265
01:04:49,919 --> 01:04:50,943
Crime writer

1266
01:04:52,223 --> 01:04:54,783
Put together an entire entire book

1267
01:04:55,295 --> 01:04:55,807
That was

1268
01:04:56,063 --> 01:04:57,343
Is really really well done

1269
01:04:57,855 --> 01:04:59,391
And then before they published it

1270
01:04:59,647 --> 01:05:05,023
It was proven that the person they said 100% did it 100% did

1271
01:05:05,535 --> 01:05:07,583
I would assume that more likely than not Belgian

1272
01:05:07,839 --> 01:05:08,351
Just be like

1273
01:05:09,119 --> 01:05:09,887
No icing

1274
01:05:10,143 --> 01:05:10,655
Think you're wrong

1275
01:05:11,167 --> 01:05:11,679
Play my book

1276
01:05:12,447 --> 01:05:13,215
I think

1277
01:05:13,471 --> 01:05:15,007
Well I mean look

1278
01:05:15,263 --> 01:05:16,287
Whatever is it

1279
01:05:18,591 --> 01:05:21,151
It's not a secondary in some ways to like

1280
01:05:21,407 --> 01:05:22,431
Peter McCalla

1281
01:05:22,687 --> 01:05:26,015
Makes you committed to a conclusion

1282
01:05:27,807 --> 01:05:29,343
When you have this guy

1283
01:05:29,599 --> 01:05:31,135
True Crime book about you

1284
01:05:31,391 --> 01:05:34,207
True Crime novel about not

1285
01:05:34,463 --> 01:05:40,607
A crime right it would look bad if you were like well you know what a Beyond over this and it turns out I died

1286
01:05:40,863 --> 01:05:43,935
Do I think that some of our previous assumptions that this true crime

1287
01:05:44,191 --> 01:05:44,703
Based on

1288
01:05:45,983 --> 01:05:49,055
Maybe a little bit salty I think you can't do that

1289
01:05:49,823 --> 01:05:51,103
Tell you something right now

1290
01:05:51,359 --> 01:05:52,383
You know that thing everybody's

1291
01:05:52,639 --> 01:05:53,407
Debunked a lot

1292
01:05:53,663 --> 01:05:55,455
I tried to make it true and

1293
01:05:55,711 --> 01:05:56,735
Can't be done

1294
01:05:56,991 --> 01:06:01,343
But it can in the context of a true-crime novel

1295
01:06:06,207 --> 01:06:08,511
Interview is

1296
01:06:08,767 --> 01:06:09,279
Knox

1297
01:06:09,535 --> 01:06:13,887
Really all that important past that just sort of Revelation that you had

1298
01:06:14,143 --> 01:06:16,959
There's this sort of dynamic involved

1299
01:06:17,215 --> 01:06:23,359
Like this guy who's supposed to be like a truth-teller about all the stuff that the media is covering up about Iver

1300
01:06:23,615 --> 01:06:25,151
Virmax and or whatever the f***

1301
01:06:25,407 --> 01:06:28,735
I Cry

1302
01:06:29,759 --> 01:06:30,271
Influence

1303
01:06:30,527 --> 01:06:31,295
Let's say

1304
01:06:31,551 --> 01:06:34,879
Make some of his his prospectus a little bit Quest

1305
01:06:35,135 --> 01:06:35,647
Cinebowl

1306
01:06:36,927 --> 01:06:39,743
Funny things Alex

1307
01:06:40,255 --> 01:06:42,559
This pickup is just great cuz I think it's Alex

1308
01:06:42,815 --> 01:06:43,839
Himself into being like

1309
01:06:44,351 --> 01:06:46,143
Yeah I can say I've read your books

1310
01:06:46,399 --> 01:06:51,007
I wasn't going to but I can't I think I can say that

1311
01:06:53,311 --> 01:06:53,823
I'm not a

1312
01:06:54,079 --> 01:06:54,591
Astorian

1313
01:06:54,847 --> 01:06:55,871
I was just like you

1314
01:06:59,199 --> 01:07:00,223
But just powerful

1315
01:07:00,479 --> 01:07:00,991
Call Jean

1316
01:07:05,087 --> 01:07:05,599
Cuz I like

1317
01:07:06,623 --> 01:07:07,391
Stop.

1318
01:07:08,671 --> 01:07:09,439
Park in Southend

1319
01:07:11,487 --> 01:07:17,631
I am willing to take a stab at it and I don't think you're going to correct me

1320
01:07:17,887 --> 01:07:24,031
I took a look at it and I realize you're not going to

1321
01:07:24,287 --> 01:07:30,431
Oh yeah which one did you like the most exactly exactly I'm going to tell you that you're one of the top writer

1322
01:07:30,687 --> 01:07:33,503
True Crime and you're not going to

1323
01:07:33,759 --> 01:07:36,831
Come in with false modesty

1324
01:07:39,903 --> 01:07:40,927
Ever let it fly

1325
01:07:41,183 --> 01:07:41,951
So dumb

1326
01:07:42,207 --> 01:07:43,231
Aurora transact

1327
01:07:43,487 --> 01:07:45,023
So you're good

1328
01:07:45,279 --> 01:07:47,071
You pretend I've read your s*** we

1329
01:07:47,327 --> 01:07:47,839
Move on

1330
01:07:49,375 --> 01:07:53,471
And it's that guy

1331
01:07:53,727 --> 01:07:57,567
Be the writer here talking to Alex about the way that we counter

1332
01:07:58,079 --> 01:08:01,919
The propaganda that's going on in the mainstream media about

1333
01:08:02,687 --> 01:08:03,199
Health

1334
01:08:03,711 --> 01:08:04,479
Exist

1335
01:08:04,735 --> 01:08:08,319
I imagine it has something to do with watching more Infowars and read more of his book

1336
01:08:08,831 --> 01:08:10,111
Wow I wonder if that's the case

1337
01:08:12,415 --> 01:08:17,791
I mean I think it starts with being aware that you're swimming in this sea is prompt

1338
01:08:18,047 --> 01:08:18,815
Buganda I mean

1339
01:08:19,071 --> 01:08:21,375
And that you know this may seem like normal CB

1340
01:08:22,655 --> 01:08:23,423
The messaging is

1341
01:08:25,215 --> 01:08:26,239
But once you realize

1342
01:08:26,751 --> 01:08:30,847
A normal is being created when you turn on the television

1343
01:08:31,871 --> 01:08:32,383
Quit

1344
01:08:32,639 --> 01:08:34,175
Quit accepting that that

1345
01:08:34,943 --> 01:08:35,967
Television is an

1346
01:08:36,223 --> 01:08:39,039
Accurate representation of reality

1347
01:08:39,295 --> 01:08:40,319
You need to start listening

1348
01:08:45,183 --> 01:08:46,719
Weed

1349
01:08:49,791 --> 01:08:53,375
I I counter that I I protest today

1350
01:08:53,631 --> 01:08:57,727
I cannot live in a world where Alex actually does not mean to lie

1351
01:08:57,983 --> 01:08:59,775
Cuz the level of the mistakes

1352
01:09:00,031 --> 01:09:02,079
The level of things that he gets wrong

1353
01:09:02,335 --> 01:09:03,359
Constantly

1354
01:09:03,615 --> 01:09:06,943
In the exact same direction

1355
01:09:07,711 --> 01:09:09,759
I think you're

1356
01:09:10,015 --> 01:09:13,599
Standing the way that he's using words as you said

1357
01:09:13,855 --> 01:09:14,879
You said how does he

1358
01:09:15,135 --> 01:09:16,927
You can't possibly not mean to lie

1359
01:09:17,183 --> 01:09:18,719
My friend he means to lie

1360
01:09:18,975 --> 01:09:19,743
He is just not

1361
01:09:19,999 --> 01:09:20,511
Trying

1362
01:09:20,767 --> 01:09:21,791
He is succeeding

1363
01:09:22,047 --> 01:09:24,351
Okay that's how you got to think of ways

1364
01:09:24,607 --> 01:09:26,143
July

1365
01:09:26,399 --> 01:09:27,167
I'm kicking ass

1366
01:09:28,447 --> 01:09:30,239
Murdering like I'm like

1367
01:09:30,495 --> 01:09:32,543
One of the top Liars there's ever been

1368
01:09:32,799 --> 01:09:38,687
Yeah I guess I guess if you look at it that way you might you might have some wiggle room where he can get away with us

1369
01:09:38,943 --> 01:09:41,759
Yeah but you were at your prediction to watch more infosource

1370
01:09:44,319 --> 01:09:46,111
Right on red

1371
01:09:47,647 --> 01:09:50,463
I mean look we tweak we come to the end

1372
01:09:50,719 --> 01:09:51,487
Of this

1373
01:09:53,023 --> 01:09:59,167
I wanted to have a longer episode because about an hour and it's you know that's unsatisfying

1374
01:09:59,423 --> 01:10:00,959
Maybe a normal length

1375
01:10:01,215 --> 01:10:03,519
For some other shows but for us it feels like

1376
01:10:04,031 --> 01:10:05,567
Annapolis boot

1377
01:10:05,823 --> 01:10:08,127
Family and it's almost like we're here we might as well beat a

1378
01:10:08,639 --> 01:10:10,431
A day off if we're only do it an hour and

1379
01:10:10,943 --> 01:10:13,247
Yeah it's it's

1380
01:10:13,503 --> 01:10:14,271
Unfortunate

1381
01:10:15,551 --> 01:10:19,903
Be you know the circumstances of Zeno trying to be overly careful and

1382
01:10:20,159 --> 01:10:22,463
You know you're taking care of your your partner

1383
01:10:22,719 --> 01:10:28,863
Well I didn't know if we're going to have a big

1384
01:10:32,447 --> 01:10:34,751
It's a little ungratifying

1385
01:10:35,007 --> 01:10:36,799
I will guarantee

1386
01:10:37,311 --> 01:10:37,823
Sneaky Snake

1387
01:10:40,383 --> 01:10:43,967
And I also think that we needed this

1388
01:10:44,479 --> 01:10:44,991
Because

1389
01:10:46,783 --> 01:10:50,879
Stop.

1390
01:10:52,159 --> 01:10:52,671
That

1391
01:10:53,183 --> 01:10:54,719
No it merits talkin about

1392
01:10:54,975 --> 01:10:56,511
But at the end of the day

1393
01:10:56,767 --> 01:11:01,887
There's not really that much else to say outside of what you can cover in about an hour

1394
01:11:03,935 --> 01:11:04,703
So there's that

1395
01:11:05,471 --> 01:11:07,263
I mean Rodger Stone did say that

1396
01:11:07,519 --> 01:11:09,055
The North Korean ship tin monkey

1397
01:11:09,311 --> 01:11:09,823
Tupac's along

1398
01:11:10,079 --> 01:11:10,847
Song with the ballot

1399
01:11:11,103 --> 01:11:12,383
It's in Maine so that's why it took

1400
01:11:12,639 --> 01:11:13,151
So long

1401
01:11:13,663 --> 01:11:14,943
To get the rest of them

1402
01:11:15,455 --> 01:11:16,479
Box out to the the country

1403
01:11:18,015 --> 01:11:18,527
To get to me

1404
01:11:19,039 --> 01:11:24,415
I would put out a compilation of the times that he predicted monkeypox

1405
01:11:24,671 --> 01:11:26,207
Videos from 2003

1406
01:11:26,463 --> 01:11:31,839
Exactly that would be great that would be great it's something like that is.

1407
01:11:32,607 --> 01:11:36,191
We'll be back on our next episode

1408
01:11:36,447 --> 01:11:40,543
And we will be in person and dig more

1409
01:11:41,055 --> 01:11:41,567
Into something

1410
01:11:42,079 --> 01:11:44,639
Pontiac website

1411
01:11:45,407 --> 01:11:46,687
We do it's outside. Com

1412
01:11:46,943 --> 01:11:47,967
World on Twitter

1413
01:11:48,479 --> 01:11:53,087
We aren't artists at knowledge underscore but until then

1414
01:11:55,647 --> 01:11:57,183
I hope you all have a dream

1415
01:11:57,695 --> 01:11:58,463
Creamy summer

1416
01:12:02,815 --> 01:12:05,887
Alexandra Thurston color with huge fan I love your work
