00:00:04,096 --> 00:00:10,240
Alexandra Thurston color

2
00:00:10,496 --> 00:00:16,640
We are careful to sit around big novelty beverages

3
00:00:17,152 --> 00:00:17,664
No

4
00:00:18,432 --> 00:00:23,040
Not stay safe today

5
00:00:23,296 --> 00:00:25,088
What do we say to the god of B

6
00:00:25,344 --> 00:00:28,672
Not today

7
00:00:28,928 --> 00:00:30,464
Today sucks alright

8
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,256
The shift

9
00:00:32,512 --> 00:00:36,096
I don't want to talk about it

10
00:00:36,352 --> 00:00:39,680
Yeah we aren't a political Affairs and I feel like

11
00:00:39,936 --> 00:00:42,496
Anytime we train drift too deeply into those Waters

12
00:00:43,008 --> 00:00:44,288
We sound like idiots

13
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:50,688
So let's not do that that's not what this shows about the shows about

14
00:00:50,944 --> 00:00:55,040
I'm still calling for a civil war I'm not sure about it

15
00:00:55,552 --> 00:00:59,136
But something's got to happen

16
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:04,512
I saw your tweet from earlier about stacking the Supreme Court

17
00:01:04,768 --> 00:01:07,328
Might be

18
00:01:07,584 --> 00:01:09,120
Probably going to retire

19
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:11,936
You better not

20
00:01:12,192 --> 00:01:18,336
Is the wizard awful Supreme Court Judge replacing him with another awful worse

21
00:01:18,592 --> 00:01:23,456
Now he's not going to be positive now

22
00:01:23,712 --> 00:01:27,040
It's bananas

23
00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:29,600
Sceptre all such a mess

24
00:01:32,928 --> 00:01:34,464
Because of the I do know one thing I want

25
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,024
How to say thank you to our new donors

26
00:01:38,304 --> 00:01:44,448
That is a tasteless transition on my part but got to get out of it somehow

27
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:47,520
I'm a policy wonk

28
00:01:47,776 --> 00:01:51,104
Refrigerator

29
00:01:58,272 --> 00:01:59,296
I'm a policy wonk

30
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:08,512
We'd appreciate it if you'd like to support the things that we do

31
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:10,304
Support the show button

32
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,608
We would appreciate it very much

33
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:15,680
And every policy wonk will be a

34
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:16,448
Commissioned officer

35
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:18,496
Or absolute

36
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:24,896
Nonsensical

37
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:28,224
The political landscape is immoral

38
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:31,040
I decided maybe it's time for us

39
00:02:31,296 --> 00:02:35,392
To do something that I've been wanting to do for a long time message

40
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:38,976
And suggested

41
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:39,744
That we do this

42
00:02:40,256 --> 00:02:46,400
Notified the heart to explain to him that I've been kicking it around for awhile

43
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:47,680
Alex Jones

44
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:50,240
A little bit

45
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:53,568
Conversations

46
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:54,336
The folks

47
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:57,408
I don't know if I said it on the show or whatever but I might have

48
00:02:57,664 --> 00:02:59,456
The theme of this show is

49
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:01,504
Alex Jones

50
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,064
Everybody is running a con

51
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:07,648
These are all running a con and they're doing it the same way

52
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:09,696
Stop lockjaw

53
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:12,000
Our listeners need to be

54
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:14,048
He told don't listen to these people

55
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:15,328
Put it

56
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:18,656
To look at how very very similar all of these

57
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:23,776
Who are the old people by pushing whites

58
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:24,544
Supremacy

59
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,080
In such a way

60
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:27,872
It's a really successful blooper

61
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:30,432
It is it's fascinating indeed

62
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:32,992
It's being done to the body politic now we're feeling it

63
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:38,880
The stuff that we're talking about right now is beginning of this show it's the end result of these

64
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:40,416
The conman

65
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:41,184
Cool

66
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:44,256
Destroyed everything is allowed people

67
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:45,536
With Bill weld

68
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:46,304
The people like this

69
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,584
Stephen Miller's of the world

70
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,864
To game the sea

71
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:52,448
The power that they are in without the huckster con man

72
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:55,008
It really just want to take old people's money

73
00:03:55,264 --> 00:03:57,056
Probably our biggest

74
00:03:57,568 --> 00:04:03,712
They're all monsters people but at the same time they motivated by wanting to

75
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:05,760
The grip Granny's

76
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:12,160
Biggest on the local level they don't want they don't want to be the Arbiter

77
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:13,184
How long the Nationals

78
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,744
Bright

79
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:23,935
You have people who get whipped up into a frenzy don't trust people who

80
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:30,335
Because we're genuinely confused anybody's listening to us

81
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:31,359
The first place you have

82
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:35,199
I apologize for not responding to a lot of emails

83
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:38,271
Is overwhelmingly emotionally

84
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:41,087
Especially nice one

85
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:46,719
Please

86
00:04:46,975 --> 00:04:48,767
Give me fuel very

87
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:52,351
Scared but a good one make me feel

88
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:53,887
Invalid

89
00:04:54,911 --> 00:04:55,423
Yeah

90
00:04:55,679 --> 00:04:57,471
We are imposter syndrome

91
00:04:57,727 --> 00:05:02,079
About my friend

92
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:03,615
Is Jim

93
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:07,711
Snow

94
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:11,551
Oh yeah we don't want to know

95
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:19,743
Stupid crazy

96
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:25,887
And all I want to do is watch more Jim Bakker

97
00:05:26,143 --> 00:05:28,703
Okay we're doing Jim Bakker and I'll be honest

98
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:30,495
Towards the end of this

99
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:31,775
I got the

100
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:32,799
Spirit got good to me

101
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:38,175
No I'm not as I get it I understand

102
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:41,503
See the tricks that he's doing to rev people off

103
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:44,575
Yeah yeah whatever

104
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:46,623
To switch it on you to sell like a

105
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:47,903
Survival radio

106
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:52,767
Jim Bakker sucks

107
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:53,791
Is a televangelist

108
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:55,327
Who's done some time in prison

109
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:59,167
We're going to get into why he's the worst person

110
00:05:59,423 --> 00:06:00,703
Someone who's gone to prison

111
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:03,007
Various various

112
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:03,775
Things that will learn

113
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:09,407
I don't even have a contact job for this episode what I was going to do is I was going to start with that song

114
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:13,759
That made the rounds that went viral that guy singing about end time

115
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:19,903
Here's the issue then now

116
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:22,719
I'm going to have to pull it up because I decided it was

117
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:28,607
Because I

118
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:31,423
I thought it was a key they like it

119
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:33,471
The one thing that most people have seen

120
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:34,495
End of Jim Bakker

121
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:38,079
They went around it was a meme that got that got sent around

122
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:40,895
I'll give you a little bit of set up here and then I'll play it

123
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:44,223
For the good people cuz for the past

124
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:47,039
Year 2 to avoid any and all social

125
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:50,367
Media still sucking tweet every now and again cuz I'm

126
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:51,135
Same person

127
00:06:52,927 --> 00:06:59,071
It for me I actually like once every couple of weeks just whenever I'm so angry and there's no one to Yellow

128
00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:02,399
Flat around me long as we're doing the show

129
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:08,287
Couple of days

130
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:11,103
I totally understand

131
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:18,783

133
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:25,183
Is either a part of Jim Baker's praise band

Orgasm doing guest vocals

135
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:33,887
And he's going to sing a song

136
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:36,703
The guy that guy

137
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:37,727
But also like

138
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:38,495
This guy's going to

139
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:39,263
Sing a song

140
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:40,287

And I'm not sure if Jim Bakker actually speaks

144
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:48,735
Behind the guy finally

145
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:50,015
Well a little.

146
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:50,783
Let's get a little death

147
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:52,063

00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:08,703
Calvary Hill from Woodbury

152
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:13,823

Oh my God

156
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:22,015
That's right that's what I f****** looks like

157
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:27,647
And this is set to my girl

158
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:28,671
Alright

159
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:30,463
Alright

160
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:35,583
Your house

161
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:50,687
I can't

162
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:52,223
Your face

163
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:56,575
Reserve to get to the koreso they we could cut bait

164
00:08:58,623 --> 00:08:59,135
Dude

165
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:03,487
Got the most racist people always want to steal black music

166
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:27,039
I'm going to go I'm just going to go see this

167
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:29,343
Yeah

168
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:33,439
Absolutely biblical to prepare for the end times

169
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:34,975
That is against the rules

170
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:41,375
I did pick up

171
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:44,447
F*** aren't allowed to You're supposed

172
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:50,847
To just shut the fuk up and be a not shity person response was going to beat now.

173
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:53,407
Is the kind of bulshit we can get behind

174
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:56,735
Now that is what I call music

175
00:09:56,991 --> 00:09:57,503
Volume eight

176
00:09:57,759 --> 00:10:00,063
That's hilarious like the diversion

177
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:08,511
Does not involve

178
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:10,303
A man that was so bad that is

179
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:14,655
So terrible that made the rounds nobody's planning on Jim Bakker for a bit that's

180
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:16,191
Always fun to see

181
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:20,799
There's a part of me that like one of the other things that makes

182
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:21,823
Be very

183
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:22,591
I'm pretty

184
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:23,359
You sure

185
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:25,663
That he didn't think that like

186
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:30,527
I'm going to do this embarrassing my girl cover and then everyone will give me free press

187
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:33,855
Like the way Alex

188
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:34,879
Sincerely like

189
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:41,279
This will really be fun for the Congress and we'll sell some of these

190
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:42,047
That

191
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:46,655
The never fried

192
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:48,447
Nope

193
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:54,847
We're going to learn a bit about his food here in a little bit

194
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:04,831
Alright we're going we're going to get real deep on a lot of stuff into Baker's to help

195
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:08,415
Alright alright

196
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:10,463
There is nothing more christ-like

197
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:15,071
Where were the bread and fish

198
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:16,095
Target

199
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:18,399
You said it my man

200
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:24,031
So I went like I don't know Jim Baker's been around for f****** ever

201
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:30,431
I was like man it would be really convenient if someone who's on Alex Jones Show a lot is also a

202
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:34,527
Would it be snowing now in that total

203
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:37,087
Michael Snyder

204
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:41,183
Is a guest on there is actually going to be on in like a week or so and another episode

205
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:45,535
But we literally we've already talked about Michael Snyder all that much on this show

206
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:48,351
He shows up a bit but he's usually fairly boring on Alex

207
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:50,399
The shop

208
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:51,167
Get that

209
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:52,703
Treatment from us

210
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:53,471
But then

211
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:55,007
Guess who I found

212
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:55,775
As a guest

213
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:58,335
On Jim Bakker Show multiple times

214
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:00,127
Steve Quayle

215
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:07,807
The moment you said Steve has like

216
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:13,439
Who's Christine

217
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:14,975
Saturday the two of them again

218
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:17,279
Come together he is a guy who's been around

219
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:18,559
Thanks

220
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:19,583
Long time

221
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,375
He's a longtime Alex Jones

222
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:22,143
Death

223
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:23,935
Yeah he's written a bunch of books about

224
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:25,983
Number

225
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:33,407
I killed you

226
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:37,247
Steve Quayle is a bit of a lunatic

227
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:38,527
Rice

228
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:40,319
Alex

229
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:41,343
See the prophet

230
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:42,879
A witch

231
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:44,159
Should leave you two

232
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:45,183
At least

233
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:47,743
On many levels

234
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:48,511
That

235
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:49,535
With some of Alex

236
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:50,303
Narrative

237
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:52,351
And I think we're going to

238
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:53,375
To see some examples

239
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:54,911
That very clearly

240
00:12:56,191 --> 00:12:57,471
Thanks to Jim Bakker

241
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:01,311
Conspiracy

242
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:04,383
Jim actually died

243
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:05,151
In jail

244
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:06,687
Jubilee in for life

245
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:07,711
5 years

246
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:08,479
You say

247
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:10,271
Just removed all of her makeup

248
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:11,295
And now

249
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:13,855
The bull

250
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:15,135
What's the time

251
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:16,927
That's what I said

252
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:19,487
Here is at the first clip that we get

253
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:20,255
Like

254
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:21,791
There's it impossible

255
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:22,559
How to make a clip

256
00:13:22,815 --> 00:13:24,095
Of the Jim Bakker Show without some

257
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:25,375
Some sales being involved

258
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:27,423
Does he talk

259
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:28,447
Telling all the

260
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:29,983
What time into this clip starts

261
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:31,007
I'm trying to sell

262
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:33,055
Sell Steve quayle's book

263
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:34,591
Genesis 6

264
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:35,615
Giant

265
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:36,639
The book

266
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:37,407
You wrote

267
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:38,175
And then

268
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:44,575
This one here what's the difference in this one this is true with all the myths and legends

269
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:50,975
Around the world in addition to Giants but it talks about why this subject is covered up by the powers-that-be

270
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:53,791
Arizona

271
00:13:58,143 --> 00:14:03,007
It's a Ballroom Blitz

272
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:04,543
Do you know about this

273
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:10,943
Well let's see if he says

274
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:14,527
Everything

275
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:16,063
Set is at the Giant

276
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:20,415
They bought them up they've had to buy museums just to get them

277
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:22,719
Absolutely why would they want to do that

278
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:25,535
Because they don't want they don't don't want

279
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:31,679
The word of God substantiated in any way shape or form

280
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:32,959
What they're going to

281
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:34,239
Play ladies and gentlemen

282
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:35,007
Is that the

283
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:38,335
Aliens Breathe by way more people been one for the Lord

284
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:42,687
By finally answering their Quest we got they'll give you good example when God said

285
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:44,479
YouTube

286
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:46,015
Go in and Jack and Caleb

287
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:48,063
Jack and Kayla going in the Promised Land

288
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:52,159
Woman child people say how could a holy God do that

289
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:58,559
How could a loving God do that that wanted to protect the genetic creation of Adam

290
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:01,631
It was about the promise and 315 Genesis

291
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:05,727
The Redeemer Jesus coming through the truth

292
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:07,775
That's why Jesus called the second Adam

293
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:09,823
There's a lot of stuff there

294
00:15:12,895 --> 00:15:14,943
Reckzo

295
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:18,527
Correct

296
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:21,343
Giants are real

297
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:24,159
Smithsonian is covering them up

298
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:29,023
In order to keep people from knowing that God is real

299
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:30,303
Is entirely accurate

300
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:32,351
When you ask

301
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:38,751
Why did God murder every man woman and child

302
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:40,031
The answer is

303
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:42,079
Cuz of course dummies

304
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:43,359
Do you want the pickle idiot

305
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:46,943
Little bit of Adam

306
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:50,015
God loves Justin

307
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:53,087
What from Justin Sullivan Kelly

308
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:58,463
So what do you know about the Smithsonian cover up my dude well the Smithsonian is a museum

309
00:15:58,719 --> 00:16:02,815
And it has a lot of interesting things

310
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:04,351
Great website

311
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:09,983
Pretty sure that's the end of the story

312
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:11,519
In December

313
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:12,543
24

314
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:16,383
They bought all the top location published an article titled quote

315
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:17,663
Smithsonian admits to

316
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:18,943
The destruction of thousands

317
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:19,711
Giant

318
00:16:20,991 --> 00:16:21,503
In the early

319
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:23,551
From this article

320
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:24,319
Quotes

321
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:26,367
A US Supreme Court ruling is forced

322
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:27,135
The Smithsonian

323
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:30,975
Petition to release classified papers dating from the early 1900's

324
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:34,047
That proves the organization was involved in major historic

325
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:35,327
Local cover-up of evidence

326
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:36,351
Showing giant

327
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:38,143
Human

328
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:39,167
Remain

329
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:40,447
Poorly written

330
00:16:40,703 --> 00:16:41,983
In the tens of thousands

331
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:44,031
Have been uncovered all across America

332
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:46,847
And were ordered to be destroyed by high-level administrators

333
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:49,407
Stream chronology of human evolution

334
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:50,175
Another time

335
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:54,015
10000 giant skeletons

336
00:16:56,575 --> 00:16:57,599
Ons of a bit seems like

337
00:16:57,855 --> 00:16:59,391
You might just find him and get

338
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:02,719
It almost seems too low it almost seems like

339
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:04,511
Any of the people who had those

340
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:08,607
Skeletons could have said no I don't know

341
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:14,239
How much is a giant skeleton run

342
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:15,007
Probably a lot

343
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:16,031
You think

344
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:17,823
Lake part of the cover-up

345
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:23,455
Yeah absolutely

346
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:29,599
You gonna go to the National Enquirer

347
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:35,999
I've always said that National Enquirer is a wasted shot though because like they would pay you that much

348
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:37,023
I know that everyone's going

349
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:41,119
Bulshit like 50 bucks

350
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:42,143
You can give you 75

351
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:43,423
That's why there's a good one

352
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:44,447
Alright

353
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:46,495
I thought they were

354
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:47,775
I assume that they had

355
00:17:48,031 --> 00:17:48,799
Destroyed all those bones

356
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:49,823
In the

357
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:51,103
Because

358
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:52,895
That was during the

359
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:53,663
Be great

360
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:56,479
The bone thing

361
00:18:03,135 --> 00:18:07,743
Strong indications of this being complete bulshit as a stories that it repurpose old

362
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:10,815
Father's Day

363
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:18,751
Pictures of the skulls of people like Eduardo pair of obopry

364
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:20,543
Gigantism

365
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:21,823
Who died in 1904

366
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:23,615
The article lies about the context of

367
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:24,639
The picture pictures

368
00:18:25,151 --> 00:18:25,663
Text believe

369
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:26,943
First up a little bit more

370
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:27,711
Difficult

371
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:32,575
Also all Spring Court decisions are a matter of public record at this one does not exist

372
00:18:34,623 --> 00:18:39,999
That stuff

373
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:46,655
This came out on the site called worldnewsdailyreport they must

374
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:51,007
Remember if this is a great recipe starting on with

375
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:51,775
Steve Quayle

376
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:54,079
Steve Quayle is a religious zealot

377
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:55,103
To the point of believing

378
00:18:55,615 --> 00:18:59,711
Music Giants because it fulfills his weird belief about Christianity

379
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:00,991
A biblical literalism

380
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:02,527
Even though

381
00:19:02,783 --> 00:19:05,855
The website that he got this from worldnewsdailyreport

382
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:07,903
Includes this as out disclaimer

383
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:08,671
Quotes

384
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:12,255
Worldnewsdailyreport is a news and political satire web publication

385
00:19:12,511 --> 00:19:14,559
Which may or may not use real names

386
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:20,959
My real or mostly fictitious ways all news articles contained within worlds has dandruff

387
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:28,639
And presumably fake news

388
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:31,967
Well that's essentially what we're dealing with

389
00:19:32,223 --> 00:19:34,015
Books about Giants

390
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:35,807
For like before this

391
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:37,855
Fake article right

392
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:39,903
Using it as

393
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:40,671
Proof

394
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:50,399
He's not on such solid footing Willie Mays

395
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:51,167
The Smithsonian

396
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:53,471
I would lose my s*** I would love it

397
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:59,871
I need a Supreme Court ruling on that

398
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:05,503
A lot of stuff about

399
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:08,575
About to

400
00:20:09,087 --> 00:20:11,903
Gadabout they wanting to stop the lineage of the 12

401
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:13,439
True God rabiou

402
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:14,719
And here is where he gets

403
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:15,999
Real

404
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:20,095
What is work conserved

405
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:20,863
What is politics

406
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:25,471
I'm not sure if he's ever going to actually touch on that part of it

407
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:28,799
The smugness here's the other thing the Scion

408
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:31,871
You see I believe that the silence in the abortion

409
00:20:32,127 --> 00:20:33,151
The world of abortion

410
00:20:33,407 --> 00:20:36,223
Let the silence in the most

411
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:42,623
No one since the Middle Ages even more so

412
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:44,159
Date somebody posted on YouTube

413
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:46,975
There's no there's no sorrow there's no Brokenness

414
00:20:47,231 --> 00:20:51,071
What time is reading the Bible where all men are one body

415
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:53,119
That's the thing that

416
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:54,399
Crazy but you know what

417
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:57,471
All that stuff is taking place and I guarantee I can

418
00:20:57,727 --> 00:20:58,495
Fruit

419
00:20:58,751 --> 00:21:01,055
Because of the total contempt for life

420
00:21:01,311 --> 00:21:04,639
Every single one of those babies that's aborted every single one of those

421
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:07,711
Brother or sister and women are being just

422
00:21:08,223 --> 00:21:09,247
Rutilated

423
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:12,063
Rutilated that's brutally murdered and mutilated you know

424
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:12,831
It works

425
00:21:13,087 --> 00:21:13,599
New word

426
00:21:14,623 --> 00:21:20,768
Cocaine

427
00:21:21,024 --> 00:21:23,584
They've just jumping around from topic to topic

428
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:24,864
Newark

429
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:34,080
He's bald eagles jumping around and yet he's a bit laconic

430
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:36,128
Little bit lethargic as well

431
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:37,664
Football is just a measurement

432
00:21:38,944 --> 00:21:40,480
No it's it's a mix

433
00:21:40,736 --> 00:21:43,552
No that's okay

434
00:21:43,808 --> 00:21:49,952
Cheese ball like heroin and cocaine

435
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:53,792
8 Ball

436
00:21:59,168 --> 00:22:00,192
If you're not

437
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:01,728
If you're not like understand

438
00:22:01,984 --> 00:22:02,496
Exactly what

439
00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:03,520
He's getting at with this

440
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:06,848
He's talking about this

441
00:22:07,104 --> 00:22:09,408
Sort of a fundamentalist Christian idea of

442
00:22:09,664 --> 00:22:13,760
Every time that a baby is aborted that might have been the new savior

443
00:22:14,528 --> 00:22:15,040
Kind of s***

444
00:22:15,296 --> 00:22:19,392
Okay he's on that tip to the point where later on he will actually Express

445
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:20,928
That it's a

446
00:22:21,184 --> 00:22:21,952
Effort

447
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:24,256
On the part of people who are pro-abortion

448
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:26,048
To make sure the next Jesus

449
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:26,816
This doesn't come

450
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:28,864
To which I would argue

451
00:22:29,888 --> 00:22:30,400
That's

452
00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:31,680
Text bad

453
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:32,704
As a lake

454
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:33,472
Your

455
00:22:35,008 --> 00:22:36,032
It seems like your religion is

456
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:37,568
But control of the universe

457
00:22:37,824 --> 00:22:41,152
Did you think it is it seems like you

458
00:22:41,408 --> 00:22:41,920
See that coming

459
00:22:42,432 --> 00:22:42,944
Your God

460
00:22:46,528 --> 00:22:47,296
Easily Blind Side

461
00:22:47,808 --> 00:22:48,832
He missed every

462
00:22:49,088 --> 00:22:51,136
Like the whole Noah thing he should have seen that

463
00:22:51,392 --> 00:22:54,208
Coming along time ago

464
00:22:54,464 --> 00:22:55,488
Redo the whole thing

465
00:22:55,744 --> 00:22:56,512
Omniscient

466
00:22:57,024 --> 00:22:59,840
The world

467
00:23:03,168 --> 00:23:05,472
Anyway that's troubling

468
00:23:05,728 --> 00:23:06,496
How come he gets

469
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:09,568
To tell people to go and kill every man woman and child at a place

470
00:23:09,824 --> 00:23:10,848
But we can't afford our baby

471
00:23:11,616 --> 00:23:12,128
That's just

472
00:23:12,384 --> 00:23:13,152
That's fair game

473
00:23:13,408 --> 00:23:17,248
You could just say God loves everyone every good turn deserves

474
00:23:17,504 --> 00:23:18,272
You can just say Godzilla

475
00:23:18,528 --> 00:23:19,552
Something like that

476
00:23:20,576 --> 00:23:22,112
Give the same credibility as he's trying

477
00:23:23,136 --> 00:23:25,952
Golden tablets

478
00:23:26,464 --> 00:23:28,000
Zoe

479
00:23:28,256 --> 00:23:29,024
We get

480
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,328
What I would call disgraceful

481
00:23:33,632 --> 00:23:34,144
Native

482
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:42,592
Very few Ministries will even address the subject

483
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:43,360
Okay

484
00:23:43,616 --> 00:23:47,456
Charts in the Grafton this means this this means that okay

485
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:50,784
And everybody's worried about this seventh seal seventh Prophet you know

486
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:57,184
And I said you know the only thing you need to worry about you better check with the Lord make sure your name is written in the Lamb's Book of Life you know

487
00:23:58,208 --> 00:24:00,512
Work work work

488
00:24:01,536 --> 00:24:07,168
Christian culture and because we got I wish delivers that were in the numbers lottery

489
00:24:07,424 --> 00:24:08,704
Who knows who knows

490
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,240
Cancel gym the true legend

491
00:24:10,496 --> 00:24:14,336
Hold up that picture right there it's hard for people to understand

492
00:24:14,592 --> 00:24:15,872
That that that's one of the

493
00:24:16,128 --> 00:24:17,664
Famous Native American legends

494
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:22,272
Delivery of the Giants being so big they could carry a buffalo or a B

495
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:23,808
Under each arm

496
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:27,392
And listen that's like having a meal on the run for these guys

497
00:24:27,648 --> 00:24:29,952
And Tom came on I don't know if he talked about it

498
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:31,488
And the Anasazi

499
00:24:31,744 --> 00:24:34,560
Indians which we lived in Mesa Verde they were the little ones

500
00:24:34,816 --> 00:24:38,144
They literally got wiped out overnight they were eaten by the Giant

501
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,704
It's okay so are we Native American Legend

502
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,240
When you spend the time I've spent

503
00:24:42,752 --> 00:24:46,336
Going through the stuff that's why the bags are under my eyes but I don't sleep much

504
00:24:46,848 --> 00:24:48,128
Probably from the 8-ball

505
00:24:48,384 --> 00:24:49,152
Speedball

506
00:24:49,408 --> 00:24:50,176
Ribault

507
00:24:50,432 --> 00:24:51,456
I would say if you

508
00:24:51,712 --> 00:24:52,736
You spend a lot of time with him

509
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:53,504
One of the first

510
00:24:54,016 --> 00:24:54,784
Things you should have come up with his

511
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:55,552
Is that honest

512
00:24:56,576 --> 00:24:58,112
You're not supposed to use that term

513
00:24:58,368 --> 00:25:01,440
Oh really the appropriate term for the population

514
00:25:01,952 --> 00:25:02,464
Ancestral Lorraine

515
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,232
Pueblo

516
00:25:03,744 --> 00:25:04,768
The reason for this is

517
00:25:05,024 --> 00:25:07,840
The word that comes from the Navajo

518
00:25:08,096 --> 00:25:09,632
Which meaning anime ancestors

519
00:25:10,144 --> 00:25:10,912
For obvious reasons

520
00:25:11,168 --> 00:25:12,192
Sabado de Puebla

521
00:25:12,448 --> 00:25:12,960
Do not walk

522
00:25:13,216 --> 00:25:14,240
Primarily referred to as

523
00:25:14,496 --> 00:25:15,520
The descendants of enemies

524
00:25:17,056 --> 00:25:17,568
Yeah

525
00:25:22,432 --> 00:25:23,456
Is it cuz like the first

526
00:25:23,712 --> 00:25:24,224
People who went

527
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:24,992
Through that like

528
00:25:25,248 --> 00:25:26,272
The first white folk who went

529
00:25:26,528 --> 00:25:32,416
Through those areas were along with a Navajo they were like these as bizware

530
00:25:32,672 --> 00:25:38,816
So there's that you had a Navajo translator with you you didn't have a translator with you

531
00:25:39,072 --> 00:25:40,608
You got that

532
00:25:40,864 --> 00:25:42,144
Yeah yeah

533
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:45,216
So I mean that you should have figured that out with

534
00:25:45,472 --> 00:25:47,776
Anytime

535
00:25:48,032 --> 00:25:53,664
Fast food

536
00:25:54,176 --> 00:25:55,456
Now here's another question

537
00:25:55,968 --> 00:25:57,504
If there are current

538
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:58,272
Poplin

539
00:25:58,784 --> 00:25:59,808
How is it that the

540
00:26:01,344 --> 00:26:02,112
Ancient ones

541
00:26:02,368 --> 00:26:03,136
We're all eating up

542
00:26:03,904 --> 00:26:04,416
Because they weren't

543
00:26:04,672 --> 00:26:06,976
But there's like

544
00:26:07,488 --> 00:26:08,000
Dispersal from

545
00:26:09,024 --> 00:26:09,792
Population that went out

546
00:26:10,304 --> 00:26:13,120
Well when the giant eats him he throws the other one away

547
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:17,472
Right right

548
00:26:18,496 --> 00:26:22,080
Appeal to Legend

549
00:26:22,336 --> 00:26:22,848
In terms

550
00:26:23,104 --> 00:26:26,432
The factual stuff exist because Native American legends

551
00:26:26,688 --> 00:26:29,248
I'd like to ask you what about a Hooter

552
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:32,832
The Aztecs water monster

553
00:26:33,344 --> 00:26:34,880
It looks something like a large

554
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:35,904
Stylized

555
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:42,304
I'm only with panda eat their eyes

556
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:48,704
I would rather that

557
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:53,056
Real the giant any day of the week if it Smithsonian is hiding that s***

558
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:54,592
Absolutely

559
00:26:54,848 --> 00:26:55,360
Every public record

560
00:26:55,616 --> 00:26:57,920
I'm just a huge fan of the gullibility

561
00:26:58,944 --> 00:26:59,968
Inherent

562
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,504
Gullibility that you can

563
00:27:02,016 --> 00:27:02,784
Heater perfectly

564
00:27:03,296 --> 00:27:06,112
Whenever a dumb person on TV goes

565
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:07,136
Wow

566
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:08,160
Ray Ray

567
00:27:08,672 --> 00:27:13,280
That that was it that was all she needed she heard that she was like wow that must be

568
00:27:13,536 --> 00:27:15,840
Be true he said it

569
00:27:16,096 --> 00:27:22,240
Who is along for the ride and making a lot of money

570
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:25,824
I thought you might

571
00:27:26,848 --> 00:27:32,992
Who viewed the coyote is a trickster figure are we going to assume that the government is covering up that coyotes love to do pranks that's actually true

572
00:27:34,016 --> 00:27:37,088
Oh what about rabbit tology

573
00:27:37,344 --> 00:27:38,368
Which is broccoli name

574
00:27:38,624 --> 00:27:41,696
I was born from a clot of blood and raised by rabbits

575
00:27:44,768 --> 00:27:50,912
What about the spirit form

576
00:27:51,168 --> 00:27:56,288
Die if you commit various things on earth

577
00:27:56,544 --> 00:27:57,824
What about

578
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:03,712
The monster that killed people

579
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:06,272
Begin the origin of ordinary skunks

580
00:28:10,624 --> 00:28:12,672
Elster

581
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,208
Like what

582
00:28:15,232 --> 00:28:15,744
I mean like

583
00:28:17,536 --> 00:28:18,560
There's only one explanation

584
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:20,096
France exact

585
00:28:20,352 --> 00:28:22,144
Play YouTube

586
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:24,704
So what I'm getting at is like Legend

587
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:25,472
And is full of

588
00:28:28,288 --> 00:28:28,800
Really

589
00:28:29,824 --> 00:28:30,848
Modern

590
00:28:31,872 --> 00:28:32,896
Real real

591
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:34,944
It's almost like you should

592
00:28:35,456 --> 00:28:35,968
Put your faith

593
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:38,784
Hey it just

594
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:39,808
Old myths

595
00:28:40,064 --> 00:28:42,880
Ripped from a time before science you shouldn't

596
00:28:43,136 --> 00:28:43,648
Your face

597
00:28:43,904 --> 00:28:44,416
Into things

598
00:28:44,672 --> 00:28:45,696
Like a wendigo

599
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:47,232
A Jesus

600
00:28:47,488 --> 00:28:49,024
You shouldn't put your faith into those pigs

601
00:28:51,072 --> 00:28:52,352
Jesus is closer

602
00:28:53,376 --> 00:28:57,216
There's Supernatural aspects two-story and stuff like that but like

603
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:04,384
Look at the end of the game is up then I'm closer to that then

604
00:29:04,896 --> 00:29:06,176
To go though or rabbit boy

605
00:29:08,736 --> 00:29:10,528
Besides the part about being born from

606
00:29:10,784 --> 00:29:11,296
Blood clot

607
00:29:11,552 --> 00:29:13,344
The part about being raised by rabbits that just

608
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,392
Like a feral child that's not really all that

609
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:16,928
Anyway

610
00:29:17,184 --> 00:29:17,696
Steve Quayle

611
00:29:17,952 --> 00:29:20,512
And that would be reinforced as we go along but

612
00:29:20,768 --> 00:29:21,792
The specific reasons

613
00:29:22,048 --> 00:29:22,560
He's being an idiot

614
00:29:22,816 --> 00:29:25,120
Some of the specific ways he tries to funnel that it is

615
00:29:25,888 --> 00:29:26,912
The message

616
00:29:28,192 --> 00:29:29,216
He's incredibly important

617
00:29:29,472 --> 00:29:30,240
And it's important

618
00:29:30,496 --> 00:29:32,288
Remember that he is someone who Alex Jones

619
00:29:32,544 --> 00:29:33,056
Reviews as a

620
00:29:33,312 --> 00:29:35,616
A prophet basically as a is a like

621
00:29:35,872 --> 00:29:36,384
The guy's a genius

622
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,920
So before we go any further

623
00:29:38,688 --> 00:29:40,736
We can say with confidence

624
00:29:41,504 --> 00:29:42,272
Jim is

625
00:29:42,528 --> 00:29:43,040
Conning people

626
00:29:43,552 --> 00:29:45,088
He doesn't believe in f******

627
00:29:46,112 --> 00:29:47,392
Now

628
00:29:47,648 --> 00:29:50,976
He's already

629
00:29:51,232 --> 00:29:52,512
Specifics about Jim Bakker but

630
00:29:56,096 --> 00:29:56,864
But he's a con man

631
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:59,424
Listen to this is the first of his commercial break

632
00:30:00,704 --> 00:30:06,080
Woodmore of the Jim Bakker Show right after this work

633
00:30:06,336 --> 00:30:11,456
We're sitting outside of our general store here at Morningside

634
00:30:11,712 --> 00:30:13,504
Real quick Morningside

635
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:17,344
Pleasant Valley

636
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,648
It's a

637
00:30:19,904 --> 00:30:20,672
Religious community

638
00:30:20,928 --> 00:30:24,512
General Store

639
00:30:24,768 --> 00:30:25,792
General Store

640
00:30:26,304 --> 00:30:32,448
Probably more action here than any place at Morningside I would guess because it never closes

641
00:30:32,704 --> 00:30:35,008
24-hour store

642
00:30:35,264 --> 00:30:37,312
I'm going to suggest

643
00:30:37,568 --> 00:30:43,712
How much did General of the General stores that happened

644
00:30:43,968 --> 00:30:50,112
Underselling Morningside by food and

645
00:30:50,368 --> 00:30:56,512
Probably I don't know if you haven't

646
00:30:56,768 --> 00:31:02,912
But you know the thing that I've been saying over and over again

647
00:31:03,168 --> 00:31:09,312
We need to be prepared for what's going to come on Earth so what we need to do

648
00:31:09,568 --> 00:31:15,712
Is read the word be prepared so that we can be a part of this

649
00:31:17,504 --> 00:31:21,600
That's going to be so Wayne time amen and so if you're not prepared

650
00:31:22,112 --> 00:31:24,160
Be prepared

651
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:26,464
Why we have this special going on

652
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:29,536
Now if you order a year of food

653
00:31:30,304 --> 00:31:36,448

654
00:31:36,704 --> 00:31:37,472

So you have like 500 servings of potatoes

661
00:32:01,536 --> 00:32:02,816
Whatever in this bucket

662
00:32:03,328 --> 00:32:04,864

Variety to it there's like a powder

00:32:14,848 --> 00:32:15,872
Food like bread

668
00:32:17,408 --> 00:32:18,688
Powdered eggs and chip

669
00:32:18,944 --> 00:32:20,224
Dammit I am hating

All of the Doomsday Preppers so much right now cuz I'm leaning towards them

671
00:32:24,576 --> 00:32:27,136
Like really realistically right now

672
00:32:27,392 --> 00:32:29,184
In ten years I think

673
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:34,304
I might want some powdered bread I don't understand what powder bread ever but there wasn't

674
00:32:34,816 --> 00:32:36,352

A lady named Jessica

737
00:35:51,168 --> 00:35:55,520
Jim's version of what happened when he was called to answer for it is less than satisfying

738
00:35:56,544 --> 00:36:02,688
Quote I saw a fully acknowledged that 7 years ago in an isolated incident I was wickedly manipulated by treacherous

739
00:36:02,944 --> 00:36:06,784
Former friends have been colleagues who victimize me with the aid of the female Confederate

740
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:09,088
They conspired to betray me into a sexual

741
00:36:09,344 --> 00:36:11,648
Counter at a time of great stress in my marital life

742
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:13,952
Vulnerable as I was at the time

753
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:38,016
No on record he said that Jim had asked for him to

754
00:36:38,272 --> 00:36:39,552
To get somebody to help make

755
00:36:40,064 --> 00:36:40,576
How do you say jealous

756
00:36:41,344 --> 00:36:44,416
So that was something that came out before

757
00:36:44,928 --> 00:36:47,232
And you just look into the details of this

758
00:36:47,488 --> 00:36:48,256
It's pretty horrifying

759
00:36:48,512 --> 00:36:49,280
Angus pretty f***** up

760
00:36:49,792 --> 00:36:52,096
Jessica side of the story which I believe far more

761
00:36:52,352 --> 00:36:53,120
Certainly

762
00:36:53,376 --> 00:36:54,912
In terms of I don't believe him at all

763
00:36:55,168 --> 00:36:55,680
I believe her

764
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:00,032
She was under the impression that you was going to go to this

765
00:37:00,288 --> 00:37:01,312
Convention

766
00:37:01,824 --> 00:37:02,336
And babysitting

767
00:37:02,592 --> 00:37:03,104
His children

768
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:05,152
Call showed up at a hotel room

769
00:37:07,712 --> 00:37:09,504
And you know

770
00:37:10,016 --> 00:37:10,784
One of those things

771
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:11,808
Really f***** up

772
00:37:12,576 --> 00:37:15,648
$279,000 in hushmo

773
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:18,976
Apparently money coming from the funds of his then Ministry

774
00:37:19,232 --> 00:37:20,256
PTL Dentistry

775
00:37:20,768 --> 00:37:21,536
Now that's an score

776
00:37:22,048 --> 00:37:23,072
Praise the Lord

777
00:37:24,096 --> 00:37:26,912
Answer the cover-up of this hush money came out Baker was forced

778
00:37:27,168 --> 00:37:27,680
What's the step down

779
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:31,776
His ministry Jerry Falwell

780
00:37:32,032 --> 00:37:34,080
Gavin cancer on the face of Christianity

781
00:37:34,336 --> 00:37:34,848
2000

782
00:37:35,104 --> 00:37:41,248
The church history coming from The Great Escape Ministries it's whatever

783
00:37:41,504 --> 00:37:43,040
Call you a little over-the-top

784
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:44,320
Either

785
00:37:45,088 --> 00:37:47,648
So in 1988 Baker was indicted on a

786
00:37:47,904 --> 00:37:50,720
Play counts of mail fraud 15 counts of wire fraud and one count of

787
00:37:50,976 --> 00:37:51,488
Conspiracy

788
00:37:51,744 --> 00:37:56,608
He served about five years of his time and for part of his cellmate was Notorious railings Buckhead

789
00:37:56,864 --> 00:37:58,912
Infrequent Alex Jones

790
00:37:59,168 --> 00:38:02,240
Who baker said was convinced that their cell was tapped

791
00:38:02,496 --> 00:38:07,872
Quote to say that Linda was slightly paranoid Baker wrote in his autobiography would be like saying the Titanic

792
00:38:08,128 --> 00:38:08,640
I had a bit of a week

793
00:38:12,736 --> 00:38:13,504
On December

794
00:38:14,272 --> 00:38:14,784
19

795
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,576
88 Lyndon larouche was convicted of

796
00:38:16,832 --> 00:38:18,112
Conspiracy to commit mail fraud

797
00:38:18,368 --> 00:38:21,184
Involving more than thirty billion dollars into faulted loan

798
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:24,000
11 counts of actual mail fraud involving 200

799
00:38:24,512 --> 00:38:25,024
94000

800
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:25,792
Defaulted loan

801
00:38:26,048 --> 00:38:26,816
And one count

802
00:38:27,072 --> 00:38:29,376
Conspiring to defraud the United States Internal Revenue

803
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:32,960
Did not file the tax return in 10 years and when asked about it

804
00:38:33,216 --> 00:38:34,240
Flames have no income

805
00:38:35,008 --> 00:38:37,312
Just a little bit of context at the time you lived on a 100

806
00:38:37,568 --> 00:38:40,640
72 acre estate I like that argument Ball Z

807
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:49,088
Jim Bakker was in trouble and ended up in prison because he'd sold tens of thousands of $1,000 lifetime membership

808
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:50,880
Which entitled people to assert

809
00:38:52,416 --> 00:38:53,184
Free Hotel he was built

810
00:38:53,952 --> 00:38:55,488
Basically was like a timeshare type of

811
00:38:55,744 --> 00:39:01,888
Never built that hotel thousands of these members only ever did end up

812
00:39:02,144 --> 00:39:04,704
Building 15 hundred room hotel but represented

813
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:05,984
Massive overselling

814
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:08,800
I was intentionally very clearly fraud

815
00:39:09,312 --> 00:39:11,872
Baker sold exclusive Partnerships which

816
00:39:12,128 --> 00:39:15,968
Exceeded capacity raising more than twice the amount of money needed to build the hotel

817
00:39:16,224 --> 00:39:16,992
Much of the money

818
00:39:17,248 --> 00:39:19,296
Heritage USA is operating expenses

819
00:39:19,552 --> 00:39:20,320
And Baker campus

820
00:39:21,088 --> 00:39:21,600
4 million

821
00:39:22,112 --> 00:39:22,880
Everybody's got over

822
00:39:23,648 --> 00:39:26,720
3.4 million overhead

823
00:39:27,744 --> 00:39:31,072
So now he runs this Jim Bakker Show with his new wife Lori

824
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:34,656
Hello peoples of the world is about to end

825
00:39:35,168 --> 00:39:38,496
He sells literally everything I can get his little Hands-On with the help of Lori

826
00:39:38,752 --> 00:39:44,896
Reminds me quite a bit of Tammy Faye

827
00:39:45,152 --> 00:39:48,992
Pleasant Valley

828
00:39:49,248 --> 00:39:50,784
Includes

829
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:53,088
The Morningside community

830
00:39:53,344 --> 00:39:53,856
Which

831
00:39:54,368 --> 00:39:55,648
It's it's f****** insane

832
00:39:55,904 --> 00:39:57,696
If you go to Jim Bakker show.com

833
00:39:57,952 --> 00:39:59,488
You can see all of the stuff

834
00:39:59,744 --> 00:40:00,256
City cell

835
00:40:00,512 --> 00:40:01,792
There's cozy cottages

836
00:40:02,304 --> 00:40:04,864
Oh that's that you can rent a vacation stay in

837
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:09,728
That would be weird I would totally do that he has condos

838
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:11,264
But they sell

839
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:15,616
Yes they snow that's for they rent out condos

840
00:40:15,872 --> 00:40:17,152
I watch other videos

841
00:40:17,664 --> 00:40:18,944
Gesticulating when he

842
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:19,968
He's giving the sermon

843
00:40:20,224 --> 00:40:22,528
He's just tickling around that the condos

844
00:40:22,784 --> 00:40:26,368
Are the same room as the key at the open

845
00:40:26,624 --> 00:40:27,136
Door

846
00:40:27,392 --> 00:40:29,696
Your front door you're in the church

847
00:40:29,952 --> 00:40:33,280
Basically worst thing I've ever heard

848
00:40:33,536 --> 00:40:37,376
Terrified the s*** out of that on top of this

849
00:40:37,632 --> 00:40:40,192
We have court the General Store where everything is rocking

850
00:40:40,704 --> 00:40:44,032
Everything is a lot action that we have an RV park

851
00:40:44,288 --> 00:40:46,592
Camping

852
00:40:47,104 --> 00:40:53,248
I don't actually think that one's too bad selling property though is f***** up to make the idea

853
00:40:54,272 --> 00:40:57,088
Prefab actually if he's selling them

854
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:58,368
Literally

855
00:40:58,624 --> 00:41:01,440
In the church yeah yeah yeah

856
00:41:01,696 --> 00:41:04,000
Boys boys really strong on that

857
00:41:04,256 --> 00:41:08,096
Yeah it's it's pretty crazy Jesus was pissed

858
00:41:08,352 --> 00:41:08,864
Yeah yeah

859
00:41:09,376 --> 00:41:15,520
Agro that was one of the few like I am the Son of God and I'm going to f*** s*** up

860
00:41:16,032 --> 00:41:17,824
So then also

861
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:19,360
The place called borries house

862
00:41:19,872 --> 00:41:20,384
Which

863
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:21,664
Is crazy

864
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:26,272
They showed a picture of it and one of the videos I like

865
00:41:27,296 --> 00:41:29,088
4-story chip

866
00:41:29,344 --> 00:41:31,136
What is the UK

867
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:36,000
It's if you go to the website and you look it up the exterior of it is

868
00:41:37,024 --> 00:41:38,048
It's pornographic

869
00:41:38,304 --> 00:41:41,632
Inside it's so big you look through the pictures of it there's like

870
00:41:41,888 --> 00:41:44,704
Ornate staircases

871
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,496
Within every picture of room

872
00:41:47,008 --> 00:41:49,568
Every picture of rooms that they have Arts

873
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:53,919
Astraphobic they feel so small weird like there's a chapel

874
00:41:54,175 --> 00:41:54,687
Haha

875
00:41:54,943 --> 00:41:55,455
Looks like now

876
00:41:55,711 --> 00:41:57,759
If it's so tight

877
00:41:58,015 --> 00:42:00,831
It reminded me of like rooms where you'd have

878
00:42:03,391 --> 00:42:08,511
Surprise meetings at work unplanned movie

879
00:42:08,767 --> 00:42:10,559
Lori's house is place

880
00:42:10,815 --> 00:42:13,887
Open healing providing a christ-centered home in

881
00:42:14,143 --> 00:42:16,191
Support the pregnant women during their pivotal time of an

882
00:42:16,447 --> 00:42:19,007
If you want to follow after me give up your world

883
00:42:20,031 --> 00:42:20,543
No

884
00:42:24,383 --> 00:42:25,407
Plus I mean

885
00:42:26,175 --> 00:42:29,503
You know on the one level you have the idea that maybe she is

886
00:42:29,759 --> 00:42:30,527
Doing a service

887
00:42:30,783 --> 00:42:32,575
Isn't helping some pregnant women who are in

888
00:42:33,087 --> 00:42:34,879
Doubt it but from the other side of it is

889
00:42:35,135 --> 00:42:35,647
You know that this is

890
00:42:36,159 --> 00:42:36,671
Deployed

891
00:42:36,927 --> 00:42:37,439
To like

892
00:42:39,231 --> 00:42:40,511
The anti-abortion

893
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:44,607
I don't I don't believe many people are saying

894
00:42:44,863 --> 00:42:46,143
Literal house

895
00:42:46,399 --> 00:42:47,679
Contract

896
00:42:47,935 --> 00:42:51,519
Could be there's a floor with very large rooms

897
00:42:52,031 --> 00:42:53,823
Give me there's a space where

898
00:42:55,871 --> 00:42:57,663
Giant skeletons

899
00:42:57,919 --> 00:43:03,807
So now it's interesting Seuss we've gotten a little bit into Jim Baker's con history and what have you and look at any rate

900
00:43:05,343 --> 00:43:06,623
What he's doing now is

901
00:43:07,135 --> 00:43:08,159
Yeah this is brutally sad

902
00:43:08,415 --> 00:43:11,231
Is pretty pretty crazy but it is super important

903
00:43:11,487 --> 00:43:12,767
Is to listen to him breakdown

904
00:43:13,023 --> 00:43:13,535
Some headlines

905
00:43:15,071 --> 00:43:18,911
Kind of breakdown

906
00:43:19,167 --> 00:43:19,679
Familiar at all

907
00:43:20,447 --> 00:43:22,751
But the thing is is that we're seeing

908
00:43:23,007 --> 00:43:25,823
Now the literal fulfillment of all the event

909
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:27,871
Corruption we see genetic corrupt

910
00:43:28,383 --> 00:43:34,527
You can read you see it. It's okay

911
00:43:34,783 --> 00:43:37,087
You see it in the Highwood called the Midas

912
00:43:37,343 --> 00:43:38,367
Dispatch of the Illuminati

913
00:43:38,879 --> 00:43:39,391
Real quick

914
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:40,927
What do you think

915
00:43:41,439 --> 00:43:41,951
Headlines

916
00:43:42,719 --> 00:43:46,559
Corrupt

917
00:43:46,815 --> 00:43:47,839
That's not

918
00:43:48,607 --> 00:43:49,119
Suggested

919
00:43:49,375 --> 00:43:50,143
It's not

920
00:43:50,399 --> 00:43:50,911
We're going to get the weather

921
00:43:51,167 --> 00:43:53,471
But just to be clear he's just

922
00:43:53,727 --> 00:43:54,239
Drudge

923
00:43:54,495 --> 00:43:56,031
Here on Jim Bakker Show

924
00:43:56,543 --> 00:43:57,823
Philosophically inclined

925
00:43:58,079 --> 00:43:58,591
Entirely

926
00:43:59,615 --> 00:44:00,127
There

927
00:44:00,383 --> 00:44:04,735
They're releasing information that will ultimately enslave us okay

928
00:44:05,247 --> 00:44:08,319
Us scientist creating human-animal hybrids

929
00:44:08,575 --> 00:44:11,647
Growing human organs inside

930
00:44:12,159 --> 00:44:13,695
That's literally

931
00:44:14,207 --> 00:44:17,279
That's literally the exact same headline that Alex Jones brings

932
00:44:17,535 --> 00:44:18,047
Look up all the time

933
00:44:21,375 --> 00:44:23,679
GMOs

934
00:44:27,775 --> 00:44:32,383
Cyborg Cris Cyborg true

935
00:44:32,639 --> 00:44:33,407
Fox News

936
00:44:33,663 --> 00:44:37,503
CNN he's our mainstream media

937
00:44:39,039 --> 00:44:42,879
Kind of gives up the game tiny bit inasmuch as

938
00:44:43,135 --> 00:44:43,903
Is he saying like

939
00:44:44,159 --> 00:44:50,303
These are from our crazy stuff stream crazyshit anytime anybody says they're from the mains

940
00:44:50,559 --> 00:44:51,327
Extreme Newton

941
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:55,679
Betrays that they know that their position is kind of crazy

942
00:44:55,935 --> 00:44:57,983
Yep so I like that a little bit

943
00:44:58,239 --> 00:44:58,751
Exactly

944
00:44:59,519 --> 00:45:03,359
This is the same message to Alex Jones in the world

945
00:45:03,615 --> 00:45:04,127
To tell you

946
00:45:04,639 --> 00:45:10,783
In order for their Victory to be complete or whatever that's part of it misrepresent

947
00:45:11,295 --> 00:45:12,319
Chimera narrative

948
00:45:13,343 --> 00:45:15,647
The Chimera narrative is now being repackaged

949
00:45:15,903 --> 00:45:16,415
Into a morse

950
00:45:16,671 --> 00:45:17,439
Specifically

951
00:45:18,463 --> 00:45:19,487
Anti-christian

952
00:45:19,743 --> 00:45:20,255
Message

953
00:45:20,511 --> 00:45:22,047
To scare this particular audio

954
00:45:22,815 --> 00:45:24,607
It's pretty crazy

955
00:45:27,679 --> 00:45:28,191
Chicken Little

956
00:45:29,215 --> 00:45:32,287
Suigetsu

957
00:45:33,567 --> 00:45:35,359
Here comes more Giants baby

958
00:45:35,615 --> 00:45:36,127
Alright

959
00:45:37,663 --> 00:45:38,687
Situation

960
00:45:40,991 --> 00:45:42,271
Relative

961
00:45:42,783 --> 00:45:43,295
2

962
00:45:43,551 --> 00:45:44,319
The Giants

963
00:45:49,183 --> 00:45:51,743
What this is a whole lot to do about the Bible

964
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:52,511
Okay

965
00:45:53,791 --> 00:45:59,423
It's over and over in the Bible it's many many places in the Bible in different words used for different Giants

966
00:46:01,215 --> 00:46:02,239
The Giants

967
00:46:04,543 --> 00:46:05,567
Are children of who

968
00:46:06,335 --> 00:46:08,383
The Giants of the children of the Fallen Angel

969
00:46:11,711 --> 00:46:12,479
Translate a giant

970
00:46:12,735 --> 00:46:16,063
Two places and numbers 1333

971
00:46:16,575 --> 00:46:17,855
After that every

972
00:46:18,367 --> 00:46:19,135
Giant boar

973
00:46:19,391 --> 00:46:20,927
Land of the Giants store

974
00:46:21,183 --> 00:46:23,999
Whatever is refer to the land of the rephaim's

975
00:46:24,255 --> 00:46:27,583
Okay Nephilim or fallen angels

976
00:46:28,095 --> 00:46:30,655
Demons are the disembodied spirit

977
00:46:31,167 --> 00:46:31,935
Of the Giant

978
00:46:32,447 --> 00:46:33,727
The demons have app

979
00:46:33,983 --> 00:46:36,799
Appetite okay fallen angels Don't inhabit people

980
00:46:39,871 --> 00:46:41,407
And then they're all Springs

981
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:46,015
They had relationships

982
00:46:47,551 --> 00:46:48,063
With

983
00:46:48,575 --> 00:46:49,343
Paper people

984
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:51,647
Angels

985
00:46:52,159 --> 00:46:53,951
Look and people say well why would

986
00:46:54,207 --> 00:47:00,095
Famous quotes scripture the misunderstanding

987
00:47:00,351 --> 00:47:01,887
Undertaker marriage that's in heaven

988
00:47:03,679 --> 00:47:04,959
Came to corrupt

989
00:47:05,471 --> 00:47:06,239
The seed

990
00:47:06,495 --> 00:47:09,823
And the whole thing was they were trying to prevent the birth of Jesus Christ

991
00:47:10,335 --> 00:47:12,639
And now why it's so important and that that's

992
00:47:12,895 --> 00:47:14,175
That's the bottom line and everything

993
00:47:14,431 --> 00:47:15,967
The reason it's important

994
00:47:16,223 --> 00:47:17,503
Is because science

995
00:47:17,759 --> 00:47:19,039
Wants to do away

996
00:47:19,295 --> 00:47:20,063
What the last

997
00:47:20,575 --> 00:47:21,855
Vestige of Adam

998
00:47:23,135 --> 00:47:23,647
What

999
00:47:24,415 --> 00:47:24,927
What

1000
00:47:25,695 --> 00:47:26,719
Volume

1001
00:47:26,975 --> 00:47:27,487
Okay

1002
00:47:27,999 --> 00:47:28,511
Okay

1003
00:47:28,767 --> 00:47:29,279
Alright

1004
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:31,327
That was a jump

1005
00:47:31,583 --> 00:47:37,215
That was the leap that was a leap dad I'm going to I'm going to use my new catch phrase

1006
00:47:37,727 --> 00:47:39,007
I reject the premise

1007
00:47:43,871 --> 00:47:45,407
Obviously

1008
00:47:46,175 --> 00:47:48,223
Fallen angels

1009
00:47:48,735 --> 00:47:52,063
I have an appetite

1010
00:47:54,111 --> 00:47:56,159
And that means

1011
00:47:56,415 --> 00:47:58,463
Is trying to destroy the line of Adam

1012
00:47:58,719 --> 00:48:01,279
That makes perfect sense

1013
00:48:01,535 --> 00:48:06,399
First is that anytime anybody is going through a laundry list of b*******

1014
00:48:06,655 --> 00:48:11,007
And then intersperses okay that means that they are wrong

1015
00:48:11,519 --> 00:48:12,287
May 2nd

1016
00:48:12,799 --> 00:48:13,311
I know

1017
00:48:13,567 --> 00:48:14,335
We're Clowning Around

1018
00:48:14,847 --> 00:48:16,127
But can we take a second

1019
00:48:16,639 --> 00:48:17,151
Give around

1020
00:48:17,407 --> 00:48:17,919
Applause

1021
00:48:18,175 --> 00:48:20,991
How great of an interviewer Jim Bakker is

1022
00:48:22,527 --> 00:48:23,039
Like

1023
00:48:26,623 --> 00:48:30,207
He is asking leading questions Cameron

1024
00:48:30,463 --> 00:48:32,255
Great work

1025
00:48:32,511 --> 00:48:35,839
You getting one word at a time to

1026
00:48:36,095 --> 00:48:36,607
What

1027
00:48:41,215 --> 00:48:43,519
Although if you say it's in the Bible

1028
00:48:43,775 --> 00:48:44,287
Flights

1029
00:48:45,055 --> 00:48:47,103
It's in the Bible

1030
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:48,383
IRead

1031
00:48:48,639 --> 00:48:49,663
Especially

1032
00:48:50,175 --> 00:48:50,687
Super Define

1033
00:48:57,343 --> 00:49:02,207
If someone says that to me I say I got to go thank you it's been real gif

1034
00:49:02,463 --> 00:49:03,743
I'm so

1035
00:49:03,999 --> 00:49:05,791
This next web starts with a

1036
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:07,583
Starting out a question

1037
00:49:12,447 --> 00:49:16,543
When you say your kids grandkids and others coming after us and history

1038
00:49:16,799 --> 00:49:18,079
That somebody wants you dead

1039
00:49:19,615 --> 00:49:23,199
Don't scare the f****** kids

1040
00:49:23,455 --> 00:49:29,599
Black children in America

1041
00:49:30,623 --> 00:49:31,135
I'm sorry

1042
00:49:31,903 --> 00:49:34,207
But they want to annihilate you

1043
00:49:34,463 --> 00:49:39,839
So the word cyborg literally means in Central Command that the military wants to be able to plug into everybody's brains

1044
00:49:40,095 --> 00:49:42,655
And run them literally he won't be able to think you know

1045
00:49:42,911 --> 00:49:45,471
General Lee

1046
00:49:45,727 --> 00:49:47,519
The one that will probably running this program

1047
00:49:47,775 --> 00:49:48,287
He's going to be

1048
00:49:48,543 --> 00:49:51,103
Sitting there on his keyboard or wiping his hand on screen

1049
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:53,663
And all the soldiers will respond to what

1050
00:49:53,919 --> 00:49:54,687
He commands them to do

1051
00:49:55,199 --> 00:49:56,735
This is also further in line with Alex

1052
00:50:00,063 --> 00:50:03,135
Right now we're getting like the idea of the cyborg troops

1053
00:50:03,391 --> 00:50:04,671
Like Alex talks about the

1054
00:50:04,927 --> 00:50:06,207
Vaccines with

1055
00:50:06,463 --> 00:50:09,791
Nanotechnology that soldiers are given and stuff like that

1056
00:50:10,047 --> 00:50:12,095
He's talked about the Chimera stuff

1057
00:50:12,351 --> 00:50:12,863
Like it's pretty

1058
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:13,631
Clear

1059
00:50:14,655 --> 00:50:16,447
Steve is responsible for a lot of Alex

1060
00:50:16,703 --> 00:50:17,471
Whose beliefs

1061
00:50:18,239 --> 00:50:19,775
Is this a show about

1062
00:50:24,127 --> 00:50:30,271
Questions

1063
00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:31,039
Whatever whatever

1064
00:50:31,295 --> 00:50:33,855
Man that's a great question it's supposed to be

1065
00:50:34,111 --> 00:50:38,207
It's mostly about selling food

1066
00:50:39,743 --> 00:50:43,071
Food cyborg

1067
00:50:43,327 --> 00:50:43,839
Bright

1068
00:50:44,095 --> 00:50:44,607
So

1069
00:50:44,863 --> 00:50:45,631
You might think

1070
00:50:46,655 --> 00:50:48,447
If you buy a giant

1071
00:50:48,959 --> 00:50:49,471
You get

1072
00:50:49,727 --> 00:50:52,287
A giant bonus They Might Be Giants

1073
00:50:52,543 --> 00:50:53,311
And bucket

1074
00:50:54,847 --> 00:50:59,199
America was named after Amerigo Vespucci

1075
00:50:59,711 --> 00:51:00,479
You probably don't

1076
00:51:01,503 --> 00:51:02,015
You don't

1077
00:51:02,271 --> 00:51:03,551
To think everything works in pocket

1078
00:51:04,063 --> 00:51:05,599
Like that but

1079
00:51:05,855 --> 00:51:06,879
Steve doesn't think that either

1080
00:51:07,391 --> 00:51:08,159
Just one thing

1081
00:51:09,183 --> 00:51:12,511
America America

1082
00:51:12,767 --> 00:51:13,535
Land of the

1083
00:51:13,791 --> 00:51:14,559
Boom Serpa

1084
00:51:15,327 --> 00:51:18,143
An interesting Lee as word land of the plumed serpent

1085
00:51:20,191 --> 00:51:23,775
Inca Amaya and practitioners the human sacrifice

1086
00:51:24,799 --> 00:51:26,079
Donnelly babies everybody

1087
00:51:26,335 --> 00:51:27,359
Went on the sacrificial

1088
00:51:27,871 --> 00:51:29,407
But they knew that the Giant

1089
00:51:29,663 --> 00:51:30,687
Who ha

1090
00:51:31,711 --> 00:51:32,479
From the East

1091
00:51:32,735 --> 00:51:34,527
Had built their Citadel

1092
00:51:34,783 --> 00:51:38,623
It's pretty tough to get an Aztec and Inca to build the Great Pyramid

1093
00:51:39,647 --> 00:51:40,415
Sickly shells

1094
00:51:40,671 --> 00:51:41,183
And Ward

1095
00:51:43,999 --> 00:51:44,767
For the technology

1096
00:51:45,279 --> 00:51:48,095
So important

1097
00:51:48,351 --> 00:51:50,911
Jesus said you know we're going to know the truth

1098
00:51:51,167 --> 00:51:52,191
The prince is going to set us free

1099
00:51:52,703 --> 00:51:56,287
And this is a good work.

1100
00:51:56,543 --> 00:51:57,055
It's coming out

1101
00:51:57,311 --> 00:51:58,847
In the press to do away with

1102
00:51:59,103 --> 00:51:59,615
Humanity

1103
00:52:02,943 --> 00:52:06,527
He's so often and Alex project Bluffs diminishing of

1104
00:52:07,039 --> 00:52:07,551
Civilization

1105
00:52:08,575 --> 00:52:11,135
Bugs with shells

1106
00:52:11,391 --> 00:52:12,671
They could never do that

1107
00:52:13,183 --> 00:52:15,487
Giants needs to be there to build the pyramids

1108
00:52:16,767 --> 00:52:18,559
Are they were pyramids they were

1109
00:52:18,815 --> 00:52:19,327
What are they called

1110
00:52:20,863 --> 00:52:24,959
What do you mean in Central America

1111
00:52:25,215 --> 00:52:25,983
Whatever it is there

1112
00:52:26,239 --> 00:52:27,263
Most people just call the

1113
00:52:28,031 --> 00:52:30,079
There's a different technical name for it

1114
00:52:30,335 --> 00:52:32,383
Also

1115
00:52:33,151 --> 00:52:35,455
Of the people that I've ever met in my life

1116
00:52:37,503 --> 00:52:40,063
That is a strong word

1117
00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:41,087
I bet Steve is

1118
00:52:41,343 --> 00:52:44,159
Is probably the most likely to believe in like Eldorado

1119
00:52:44,671 --> 00:52:46,463
Let's

1120
00:52:48,255 --> 00:52:49,279
Do giants

1121
00:52:50,815 --> 00:52:52,095
Is actually made of their bones

1122
00:52:52,351 --> 00:52:54,655
Destroyed

1123
00:52:54,911 --> 00:52:59,007
Mysteries solved

1124
00:53:00,799 --> 00:53:02,335
No that's the

1125
00:53:02,591 --> 00:53:03,615
Just a classic sort of whites

1126
00:53:03,871 --> 00:53:04,895
Supremacist world

1127
00:53:05,151 --> 00:53:07,199
You know just a lately white

1128
00:53:08,735 --> 00:53:09,759
Before couldn't do s***

1129
00:53:10,271 --> 00:53:11,551
Everything else

1130
00:53:11,807 --> 00:53:13,343
Must be proof of alien

1131
00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:14,879
Or Giant

1132
00:53:16,159 --> 00:53:17,183
Because these dumb people

1133
00:53:17,695 --> 00:53:18,207
Figure out

1134
00:53:21,791 --> 00:53:22,559
Anyway

1135
00:53:22,815 --> 00:53:27,679
That's such like Marco Polo's description like

1136
00:53:28,447 --> 00:53:34,591
You know the the old drawings that he had whenever he came back of people who didn't have heads or hands or feet but they had

1137
00:53:34,847 --> 00:53:35,615
Add spaces in there

1138
00:53:35,871 --> 00:53:36,639
Chaste life

1139
00:53:37,151 --> 00:53:38,687
It was all pretty much b*******

1140
00:53:38,943 --> 00:53:43,295
He's making up most of it

1141
00:53:43,807 --> 00:53:47,391
I've never been there you must be right like this is also where the guys like

1142
00:53:48,671 --> 00:53:53,279
You don't know anything about the native text about

1143
00:53:53,535 --> 00:53:56,607
I think we would still be susceptible to that

1144
00:53:56,863 --> 00:53:57,375
Mentality

1145
00:53:57,631 --> 00:53:59,679
Even nowadays it's like one person went to

1146
00:53:59,935 --> 00:54:02,751
Tamar's or something like that

1147
00:54:03,007 --> 00:54:03,775
Legitimately

1148
00:54:04,031 --> 00:54:05,311
Prove they went to Mars

1149
00:54:05,567 --> 00:54:10,175
I never liked that a bunch of

1150
00:54:10,431 --> 00:54:11,455
Ruby like well

1151
00:54:11,711 --> 00:54:13,759
He was there he was on Mars

1152
00:54:14,015 --> 00:54:16,831
That's true huh but it'll be the same

1153
00:54:17,087 --> 00:54:18,623
Scrupulous

1154
00:54:19,903 --> 00:54:20,671
Sing

1155
00:54:20,927 --> 00:54:21,439
Think you're telling

1156
00:54:21,695 --> 00:54:22,207
The truth

1157
00:54:22,975 --> 00:54:23,743
Brenda Morris

1158
00:54:23,999 --> 00:54:24,511
Here

1159
00:54:24,767 --> 00:54:25,535
Steve says something

1160
00:54:26,559 --> 00:54:27,071
Really fun

1161
00:54:27,583 --> 00:54:28,863
And it actually

1162
00:54:29,375 --> 00:54:30,143
One of my

1163
00:54:32,191 --> 00:54:32,703
Respond to login

1164
00:54:35,263 --> 00:54:36,287
And you know what the biggest rat

1165
00:54:36,543 --> 00:54:38,591
The world at this point is Persia

1166
00:54:38,847 --> 00:54:41,151
A okay

1167
00:54:41,407 --> 00:54:45,759
They just announced that they have the electronic warfare any military guys to know what this mean

1168
00:54:46,271 --> 00:54:48,063
Taking shut down everything the US

1169
00:54:48,319 --> 00:54:51,135
Possesses and the Russians did it the other day again

1170
00:54:51,391 --> 00:54:54,719
The Donald Cook the most sophisticated billion-dollar

1171
00:54:55,743 --> 00:55:01,119
And they basically flipped the switch that sucker went dead in the water not the soccer the chief went dead in the water

1172
00:55:02,143 --> 00:55:04,191
Probably suckers really more accurate because

1173
00:55:04,447 --> 00:55:06,239
If you're got a billion dollars

1174
00:55:06,495 --> 00:55:08,287
Someone can throw the switch on you

1175
00:55:08,543 --> 00:55:11,871
And your multiple weapons platform just goes dead in the water

1176
00:55:12,127 --> 00:55:13,919
I would guess you're adept.

1177
00:55:14,175 --> 00:55:15,967
Furnace base adapter

1178
00:55:16,223 --> 00:55:19,551
What's the name of the ships

1179
00:55:19,807 --> 00:55:23,135
Michael the Archangel Gabriel

1180
00:55:23,391 --> 00:55:23,903
The fighting

1181
00:55:24,159 --> 00:55:25,183
Against the Prince of Persia

1182
00:55:25,439 --> 00:55:26,463
And it's at the Prince of Persia

1183
00:55:26,719 --> 00:55:28,511
Iran now

1184
00:55:29,279 --> 00:55:31,839
It's nothing you have have that will work against

1185
00:55:32,607 --> 00:55:34,655
Nothing that's not an idle boast

1186
00:55:35,423 --> 00:55:36,703
That's not an idle boast

1187
00:55:37,983 --> 00:55:39,007
What I do I go God

1188
00:55:39,775 --> 00:55:40,799
One more day

1189
00:55:41,567 --> 00:55:45,407
For people to repent one more day for people cuz we talked about the end time Harvest

1190
00:55:45,663 --> 00:55:49,759
And you were that position now and somebody was telling me that there's a scene Angels around

1191
00:55:50,015 --> 00:55:52,063
This whole area ghetto meaning your you're

1192
00:55:52,319 --> 00:55:53,087
Perimeter Institute

1193
00:55:53,343 --> 00:55:55,135
I'm going to send my angel

1194
00:55:55,391 --> 00:55:56,415
Compel

1195
00:55:56,671 --> 00:55:57,183
People to come in

1196
00:55:57,439 --> 00:56:00,511
Compel them and those that are quote religious alt-right

1197
00:56:00,767 --> 00:56:01,535
Justin don't need Jesus

1198
00:56:01,791 --> 00:56:03,071
Well they've got their reward

1199
00:56:03,327 --> 00:56:04,863
I mean that

1200
00:56:05,119 --> 00:56:07,167
I hope not liberate

1201
00:56:07,423 --> 00:56:10,239
Come later that's the point that I'm really trying to make is this

1202
00:56:10,751 --> 00:56:12,031
We are in we're not in

1203
00:56:12,287 --> 00:56:14,335
We are in the last days

1204
00:56:14,847 --> 00:56:15,359
Okay

1205
00:56:15,871 --> 00:56:17,919
Well then I don't think I'm going to need a Year's worth

1206
00:56:18,175 --> 00:56:22,527
I don't think I will

1207
00:56:22,783 --> 00:56:27,391
Depends if you post a pre-trib rapture

1208
00:56:27,647 --> 00:56:28,159
If your post

1209
00:56:28,415 --> 00:56:30,975
As we all know we all know

1210
00:56:31,231 --> 00:56:31,743
Pre-trib

1211
00:56:31,999 --> 00:56:32,511
Bulshit

1212
00:56:32,767 --> 00:56:33,791
Oh yeah

1213
00:56:36,351 --> 00:56:38,655
So the Archangel Michael fought against

1214
00:56:38,911 --> 00:56:39,423
Jake Gyllenhaal

1215
00:56:44,031 --> 00:56:45,823
I don't care about that

1216
00:56:46,335 --> 00:56:49,407
The USS Donald Cook

1217
00:56:50,175 --> 00:56:51,199
Very interesting

1218
00:56:51,455 --> 00:56:51,967
Right

1219
00:56:52,223 --> 00:56:52,991
In American history

1220
00:56:53,759 --> 00:56:55,039
Situation

1221
00:56:55,295 --> 00:56:56,319
2014

1222
00:56:56,575 --> 00:56:59,903
What's happened

1223
00:57:00,159 --> 00:57:00,671
Sort of

1224
00:57:01,183 --> 00:57:01,951
But

1225
00:57:02,975 --> 00:57:03,743
That's not at all

1226
00:57:05,279 --> 00:57:06,815
USS Donald Cook with making Anna

1227
00:57:07,071 --> 00:57:07,839
Excursion into the blacks

1228
00:57:08,095 --> 00:57:12,191
Speed when it was buzzed overhead by multiple Russian su-24

1229
00:57:12,703 --> 00:57:14,239
They made a number of passes

1230
00:57:14,495 --> 00:57:15,775
Absolutely not appropriate.

1231
00:57:16,031 --> 00:57:16,543
Combat Behavior

1232
00:57:17,055 --> 00:57:18,847
In hindsight is pretty clear this was an attack

1233
00:57:19,359 --> 00:57:20,383
Provoca the ship-to-ship

1234
00:57:20,639 --> 00:57:21,151
Do down there

1235
00:57:21,407 --> 00:57:21,919
24th

1236
00:57:22,175 --> 00:57:22,687
And create

1237
00:57:22,943 --> 00:57:24,735
This point the US European Alliance

1238
00:57:24,991 --> 00:57:26,015
There was standing

1239
00:57:26,271 --> 00:57:27,295
At the time between Putin

1240
00:57:27,551 --> 00:57:28,319
Full-scale gravity

1241
00:57:29,343 --> 00:57:29,855
So

1242
00:57:30,111 --> 00:57:31,135
That is what happened

1243
00:57:31,391 --> 00:57:32,159
This ID

1244
00:57:32,415 --> 00:57:33,183
Dia of the

1245
00:57:33,695 --> 00:57:34,975
Electronic shutdown

1246
00:57:35,231 --> 00:57:35,743
Of the ship

1247
00:57:37,279 --> 00:57:38,815
This is so interesting tell me about that

1248
00:57:39,071 --> 00:57:42,399
That's so a group called the digital forensic research lab

1249
00:57:42,655 --> 00:57:48,287
I checked them out they did a deep dive in

1250
00:57:52,127 --> 00:57:53,919
Well forensic

1251
00:57:54,175 --> 00:57:55,199
Examinations of where

1252
00:57:55,455 --> 00:57:55,967
Things come

1253
00:57:56,479 --> 00:57:58,015
So they did some research

1254
00:57:58,271 --> 00:57:59,807
Claims about Donald Cook having a

1255
00:58:00,063 --> 00:58:00,575
Elektra

1256
00:58:00,831 --> 00:58:01,599
Electronics

1257
00:58:01,855 --> 00:58:02,367
Disabled because

1258
00:58:02,623 --> 00:58:05,183
The story was going around but it also didn't

1259
00:58:06,207 --> 00:58:06,975
So where

1260
00:58:07,231 --> 00:58:07,999
The story come from

1261
00:58:08,511 --> 00:58:11,071
The dfr alphabet a number of the almost

1262
00:58:11,327 --> 00:58:15,679
Identical post on Facebook to be in the form of a letter

1263
00:58:15,935 --> 00:58:19,263
Around the time in April of 2014

1264
00:58:19,519 --> 00:58:23,103
I think I can see where this ends on the ship

1265
00:58:23,359 --> 00:58:24,639
To his beloved

1266
00:58:24,895 --> 00:58:28,479
Mary they're all clearly machine-translated as they reflect very

1267
00:58:28,735 --> 00:58:30,527
Types of Miss translation of English

1268
00:58:30,783 --> 00:58:31,295
And includes

1269
00:58:31,551 --> 00:58:33,855
Suspicious details that leads you to a pretty

1270
00:58:34,111 --> 00:58:35,135
Gases to who's writing

1271
00:58:35,391 --> 00:58:36,159
Like quote

1272
00:58:36,415 --> 00:58:40,255
We Thrice cried Hip Hop Hooray

1273
00:58:43,583 --> 00:58:49,727
I'm prepared to show the Russians that what awaits them if they raise their hand for the second half of Ukraine

1274
00:58:49,983 --> 00:58:50,751
Are we all screamed out

1275
00:58:51,007 --> 00:58:53,311
Hip Hop

1276
00:58:54,591 --> 00:58:56,639
But you catch at 2 p.m.

1277
00:58:56,895 --> 00:59:00,991
Scream to threaten the Russians if they touch more of the Ukraine

1278
00:59:02,271 --> 00:59:02,783
What's going on

1279
00:59:03,295 --> 00:59:03,807
Yeah

1280
00:59:04,063 --> 00:59:09,951
So all these posts linked back to the entire letter which was posted as a Russian language

1281
00:59:10,207 --> 00:59:12,767
Opinion piece by a guy named Dimitri set

1282
00:59:13,279 --> 00:59:16,351
I would appear to have been written

1283
00:59:16,607 --> 00:59:17,119
Satirizing

1284
00:59:17,375 --> 00:59:17,887
U.s. Navy

1285
00:59:18,399 --> 00:59:18,911
Quote

1286
00:59:19,167 --> 00:59:21,215
Mary you can't imagine how we were

1287
00:59:21,471 --> 00:59:27,615
We've never been so ashamed in our lives other beat their heads against the equipment that wasn't working

1288
00:59:28,127 --> 00:59:31,455
The first officer dragged down a whole bottle of whiskey in front of everyone and shouted

1289
00:59:31,711 --> 00:59:32,991
Those freaking Russian

1290
00:59:34,527 --> 00:59:37,599
Repeat those freaking Russian kid beanie

1291
00:59:37,855 --> 00:59:39,135
Which is B I like technology

1292
00:59:39,391 --> 00:59:40,415
Empi

1293
00:59:41,695 --> 00:59:43,743
I had to ride the captain was green with rage

1294
00:59:43,999 --> 00:59:50,143
In this condition we were barely able to lower the roommate at the Romanian Shore and right after luring three dozen of our guys wrote

1295
00:59:50,399 --> 00:59:51,167
Their resignation letter

1296
00:59:51,679 --> 00:59:55,519
They couldn't bear the thought that a decisive moment in our equipment could turn into crap

1297
00:59:55,775 --> 00:59:57,311
Which state have to go to the bottom of

1298
00:59:59,103 --> 01:00:01,151
So this story was picked up by the Russian

1299
01:00:01,407 --> 01:00:03,455
State-controlled Channel

1300
01:00:05,247 --> 01:00:06,527
The show with it was Eric on it

1301
01:00:06,783 --> 01:00:07,295
It is called Vespa

1302
01:00:07,807 --> 01:00:09,599
Based

1303
01:00:09,855 --> 01:00:10,367
Based on

1304
01:00:10,623 --> 01:00:11,647
This haha

1305
01:00:12,159 --> 01:00:15,231
Report

1306
01:00:17,023 --> 01:00:17,535
27

1307
01:00:17,791 --> 01:00:18,303
19

1308
01:00:18,559 --> 01:00:21,119
The peace it was covered

1309
01:00:21,375 --> 01:00:24,191
Hold on covered by tons of foreign media

1310
01:00:25,215 --> 01:00:28,543
Not realize they were either directly amplifying Russian propaganda

1311
01:00:28,799 --> 01:00:31,615
Panda or at least covering a satire article to know and realize was

1312
01:00:32,127 --> 01:00:32,895
But

1313
01:00:33,663 --> 01:00:35,455
He was on Jim Bakker Show in 20

1314
01:00:35,711 --> 01:00:36,223
2016

1315
01:00:36,735 --> 01:00:38,015
So we couldn't have learned of this version

1316
01:00:38,271 --> 01:00:38,783
End of the story from

1317
01:00:39,039 --> 01:00:41,343
The Sun or the times are any of the articles

1318
01:00:41,599 --> 01:00:42,367
Came out 27

1319
01:00:42,879 --> 01:00:44,159
So he is learning this

1320
01:00:44,415 --> 01:00:45,183
Straight from the dec

1321
01:00:46,207 --> 01:00:46,719
Has to have

1322
01:00:47,743 --> 01:00:49,279
Wow hard to say for sure

1323
01:00:49,535 --> 01:00:50,303
Exactly where it came

1324
01:00:50,559 --> 01:00:51,327
In front but Sputnik

1325
01:00:51,583 --> 01:00:53,375
Put on article on their German site

1326
01:00:53,631 --> 01:00:55,167
Claiming that they crippled the Donald Cook

1327
01:00:55,679 --> 01:00:56,447
In April 24th

1328
01:00:56,959 --> 01:00:59,007
And this is from the DF

1329
01:00:59,263 --> 01:01:02,335
Dfr l2040

1330
01:01:02,591 --> 01:01:03,871
Russian State newspaper

1331
01:01:04,127 --> 01:01:06,943
Rusty's Kia Gazeta ran along

1332
01:01:07,199 --> 01:01:08,223
Gloating article claiming

1333
01:01:08,479 --> 01:01:10,015
That the su-24 at Target

1334
01:01:10,271 --> 01:01:10,783
Did the cook with the

1335
01:01:11,039 --> 01:01:12,063
Kabini system

1336
01:01:12,319 --> 01:01:13,599
Knocking the entire agency

1337
01:01:13,855 --> 01:01:14,623
System out of action

1338
01:01:14,879 --> 01:01:17,183
And the shipping quote hurry to a Romanian porch

1339
01:01:17,439 --> 01:01:18,207
Historic nerves

1340
01:01:18,719 --> 01:01:21,535
By November Infowars reported on it with the headline

1341
01:01:21,791 --> 01:01:23,583
Russians disable us guided-missile

1342
01:01:23,839 --> 01:01:24,351
Destroyer

1343
01:01:24,607 --> 01:01:27,423
Incident skipped over by Pentagon friendly corporate media

1344
01:01:27,935 --> 01:01:29,215
Of course the article is pretty soon

1345
01:01:29,471 --> 01:01:29,983
Sympathetic to the rush

1346
01:01:30,239 --> 01:01:31,007
Oceanside quotes

1347
01:01:31,263 --> 01:01:35,871
Russia has condemned the placement of NATO by NATO of a radar on the Czech Republic

1348
01:01:36,127 --> 01:01:37,407
Attend interceptors in Poland

1349
01:01:37,663 --> 01:01:40,479
Russia is also sending a message in the wake of the United States

1350
01:01:40,735 --> 01:01:41,247
Tomato decision

1351
01:01:41,503 --> 01:01:42,015
Confronted over

1352
01:01:43,551 --> 01:01:44,063
In the crisis in

1353
01:01:45,087 --> 01:01:49,439
So that was my November could have been regarded from Infowars was getting it from all of these

1354
01:01:49,695 --> 01:01:51,231
Yeah Russian

1355
01:01:51,487 --> 01:01:55,839
But the only way for that narrative existed before

1356
01:01:56,095 --> 01:01:57,375
Like the sign of the times

1357
01:01:57,631 --> 01:02:02,239
And picked up on the story of 2017

1358
01:02:02,495 --> 01:02:03,263
Ramsey's

1359
01:02:03,519 --> 01:02:04,287
Foreign

1360
01:02:04,799 --> 01:02:05,823
Propaganda sources

1361
01:02:06,335 --> 01:02:06,847
So

1362
01:02:08,639 --> 01:02:09,151
Who's at the door

1363
01:02:09,919 --> 01:02:12,223
Steve Quayle you are a

1364
01:02:12,479 --> 01:02:13,503
Disgusting

1365
01:02:15,807 --> 01:02:21,951
I got a bunch of them in the car

1366
01:02:22,975 --> 01:02:23,999
Uno

1367
01:02:24,255 --> 01:02:25,023
Call Jonathan cloud

1368
01:02:25,535 --> 01:02:27,839
The glove box

1369
01:02:28,095 --> 01:02:28,863
Go fuc yourself

1370
01:02:29,375 --> 01:02:30,143
Stupid ass off

1371
01:02:34,751 --> 01:02:38,591
It's fascinating at the layers of it like

1372
01:02:38,847 --> 01:02:42,687
If you read the stone article and just didn't you know didn't yet to it and thought it was true

1373
01:02:42,943 --> 01:02:45,247
But then the timeline no no no Steve

1374
01:02:47,807 --> 01:02:51,391
Propaganda Outlet

1375
01:02:51,903 --> 01:02:52,927
In Russia like Sputnik

1376
01:02:53,183 --> 01:02:58,303
Rufus kayak Gazeta they tried to push it but no one picked up

1377
01:02:58,815 --> 01:02:59,583
If so

1378
01:02:59,839 --> 01:03:00,351
They didn't work

1379
01:03:00,863 --> 01:03:01,631
Then here

1380
01:03:03,423 --> 01:03:03,935
When they did it

1381
01:03:04,191 --> 01:03:04,703
It again

1382
01:03:04,959 --> 01:03:05,727
The same story when they

1383
01:03:05,983 --> 01:03:06,751
They tried to do it again

1384
01:03:07,263 --> 01:03:08,543
You can see the forensic fingerprint

1385
01:03:08,799 --> 01:03:10,847
Prince being exactly

1386
01:03:11,103 --> 01:03:11,615
The song

1387
01:03:11,871 --> 01:03:12,895
And the Daily Mail

1388
01:03:13,151 --> 01:03:16,223
The other ones but other kind of publication

1389
01:03:16,479 --> 01:03:16,991
Picked it up

1390
01:03:18,015 --> 01:03:18,527
It's no bolts

1391
01:03:18,783 --> 01:03:19,295
From there right

1392
01:03:19,551 --> 01:03:20,063
Crazy

1393
01:03:20,831 --> 01:03:21,343
That's fantastic

1394
01:03:21,599 --> 01:03:22,111
I love it

1395
01:03:22,623 --> 01:03:23,903
I don't understand

1396
01:03:24,159 --> 01:03:24,671
Why

1397
01:03:25,951 --> 01:03:26,975
If you are doing this

1398
01:03:27,743 --> 01:03:29,023
And if you know that it's propaganda

1399
01:03:29,791 --> 01:03:30,559
You don't

1400
01:03:30,815 --> 01:03:31,583
Mix up the letter

1401
01:03:32,095 --> 01:03:34,655
And just just rewrite it in into life

1402
01:03:34,911 --> 01:03:35,679
Just like

1403
01:03:35,935 --> 01:03:37,983
For real just turned it into a civil war

1404
01:03:38,239 --> 01:03:38,751
Dearest

1405
01:03:39,007 --> 01:03:39,519
No

1406
01:03:39,775 --> 01:03:41,567
We stood upon the deck of the

1407
01:03:41,823 --> 01:03:42,591
John Cook

1408
01:03:42,847 --> 01:03:45,151
Most of these Donald Tucker whatever

1409
01:03:47,199 --> 01:03:48,479
So like a lot of it is just like

1410
01:03:48,735 --> 01:03:50,271
You don't have someone on that yet

1411
01:03:50,527 --> 01:03:51,039
Automate

1412
01:03:51,807 --> 01:03:52,831
I feel like you got to have somebody

1413
01:03:53,599 --> 01:03:54,879
You should have

1414
01:03:55,135 --> 01:03:59,999
Why are we still giving advice to propaganda this just goes to show the realest I mean

1415
01:04:00,255 --> 01:04:01,791
Of course information Warfare asthma going on

1416
01:04:02,047 --> 01:04:03,071
On forever

1417
01:04:03,327 --> 01:04:04,095
This sort of

1418
01:04:05,375 --> 01:04:06,143
Targeted

1419
01:04:07,423 --> 01:04:07,935
Approach

1420
01:04:08,447 --> 01:04:08,959
From Russia

1421
01:04:09,727 --> 01:04:10,239
And

1422
01:04:10,751 --> 01:04:11,775
The figures

1423
01:04:12,031 --> 01:04:12,799
The people like

1424
01:04:13,055 --> 01:04:13,823
Steve Quayle

1425
01:04:14,079 --> 01:04:15,871
Who's big influence on Alex Jones

1426
01:04:16,127 --> 01:04:18,687
They are clearly on board with Russia already

1427
01:04:19,455 --> 01:04:20,479
You can see from Alex

1428
01:04:21,247 --> 01:04:23,807
Carburetor

1429
01:04:24,063 --> 01:04:27,135
Yeah they're already been holding two or tricks by

1430
01:04:27,391 --> 01:04:28,415
Manipulation

1431
01:04:28,671 --> 01:04:29,439
Better being done

1432
01:04:29,695 --> 01:04:30,207
So it's like

1433
01:04:31,231 --> 01:04:33,535
I don't know whoever talked about that the like

1434
01:04:34,559 --> 01:04:36,351
What were they doing in 2016

1435
01:04:36,863 --> 01:04:37,375
Marriage

1436
01:04:38,143 --> 01:04:38,911
They were already done

1437
01:04:39,167 --> 01:04:41,727
They'd already done a lot

1438
01:04:42,239 --> 01:04:43,775
I'm so now let's get another commercial just

1439
01:04:44,031 --> 01:04:46,591
Get this out of our hair a little bit

1440
01:04:46,847 --> 01:04:52,991
Heirloom seeds

1441
01:04:53,247 --> 01:04:59,391
20 different types of vegetables

1442
01:04:59,647 --> 01:05:05,791
There are Luminate they just they come back every year and it is

1443
01:05:06,047 --> 01:05:07,839
It's a great

1444
01:05:08,095 --> 01:05:14,239
A double blessing it is if you get the 7 years of food then

1445
01:05:14,495 --> 01:05:20,639
You have the seeds you can just keep adding all this food and mixing together you have all this

1446
01:05:20,895 --> 01:05:27,039
Outside and pick from the garden add that in and add the rice and the multiplier

1447
01:05:28,319 --> 01:05:34,463
As someone who eats mostly eggs and rice and vegetables

1448
01:05:34,719 --> 01:05:36,255
And if

1449
01:05:36,511 --> 01:05:38,303
If enzymes were coming

1450
01:05:38,815 --> 01:05:39,327
Dial be like

1451
01:05:39,839 --> 01:05:40,351
Great

1452
01:05:40,863 --> 01:05:41,887
Whoopty

1453
01:05:42,911 --> 01:05:47,007
I'm not be excited about it like I don't know what it is

1454
01:05:47,263 --> 01:05:49,311
Something about the way he says food makes me

1455
01:05:49,823 --> 01:05:50,847
Food food

1456
01:05:52,895 --> 01:05:55,455
Seven years of food

1457
01:05:56,735 --> 01:05:59,295
To talk about it

1458
01:05:59,551 --> 01:06:04,927
It's a double

1459
01:06:06,463 --> 01:06:10,303
Got you also other things and silver solution

1460
01:06:10,815 --> 01:06:14,399
Like you probably a colloidal silver of some kind God.

1461
01:06:14,911 --> 01:06:17,215
Also he at least shares one sponsor

1462
01:06:17,471 --> 01:06:17,983
Literally

1463
01:06:18,495 --> 01:06:20,543
Alexapure air filters

1464
01:06:20,799 --> 01:06:21,567
Alex Jones

1465
01:06:21,823 --> 01:06:23,103
That was one of the sponsors

1466
01:06:23,359 --> 01:06:24,127
There's a sponsor

1467
01:06:24,383 --> 01:06:24,895
Of

1468
01:06:25,151 --> 01:06:26,687
Jim Bakker

1469
01:06:27,199 --> 01:06:28,223
Who Alexa

1470
01:06:28,479 --> 01:06:34,623
Probably sign on them

1471
01:06:34,879 --> 01:06:40,511
Probably just sell through them there's like wholesalers

1472
01:06:40,767 --> 01:06:44,095
You know we just mark down a little bit

1473
01:06:44,351 --> 01:06:45,887
Right reason we still filters

1474
01:06:46,143 --> 01:06:48,703
We haven't heard

1475
01:06:48,959 --> 01:06:49,983
Like the Alexa fiehrer person

1476
01:06:50,239 --> 01:06:53,823
Come on out the show and do limericks yet

1477
01:06:54,079 --> 01:06:54,847
Bulgaria map

1478
01:06:56,127 --> 01:06:59,711
Another similarity with Alex

1479
01:07:00,991 --> 01:07:01,503
Of the rhetoric

1480
01:07:03,295 --> 01:07:05,343
At all of these things are happening

1481
01:07:05,599 --> 01:07:06,367
I was so shocked

1482
01:07:06,623 --> 01:07:08,159
When Tom Horn told me

1483
01:07:08,415 --> 01:07:09,439
Dadant Everett

1484
01:07:09,695 --> 01:07:10,719
Single state

1485
01:07:11,487 --> 01:07:13,023
They are experimenting

1486
01:07:13,535 --> 01:07:14,815
Wolf hybrid human being

1487
01:07:15,327 --> 01:07:16,607
Don't worry about who Tom Horn

1488
01:07:17,631 --> 01:07:19,679
He's at another time

1489
01:07:20,191 --> 01:07:20,703
Okay

1490
01:07:20,959 --> 01:07:21,471
Absolutely

1491
01:07:21,727 --> 01:07:23,007
Human

1492
01:07:25,055 --> 01:07:27,103
How do I say sacrifice

1493
01:07:32,223 --> 01:07:32,735
You can't

1494
01:07:33,759 --> 01:07:36,063
Put Christmas tree in Town Square

1495
01:07:37,087 --> 01:07:40,415
It's not as government property

1496
01:07:41,695 --> 01:07:43,231
Doing experiment on

1497
01:07:44,255 --> 01:07:45,791
It's because the people that are making

1498
01:07:46,047 --> 01:07:47,071
A war on Chris

1499
01:07:47,839 --> 01:07:49,119
Want them absolutely

1500
01:07:49,631 --> 01:07:50,143
Destroyed

1501
01:07:50,399 --> 01:07:52,959
This is something that the Christians understand we've been given

1502
01:07:53,215 --> 01:07:54,495
Power through the Holy Spirit

1503
01:07:54,751 --> 01:08:00,127
Anymore very few okay there is no way to deal with the stuff in the nap

1504
01:08:00,639 --> 01:08:01,919
So you don't

1505
01:08:03,967 --> 01:08:05,503
You've got you've got a left-handed right now

1506
01:08:05,759 --> 01:08:09,855
And let me know you got to prep you got to have your power your food you know your water critical

1507
01:08:10,111 --> 01:08:15,999
Okay the ability to defend yourself and I'm by the way I'm a guy that preaches on the radio every woman that every woman

1508
01:08:17,279 --> 01:08:18,047
Concealed weapons permit

1509
01:08:18,303 --> 01:08:20,607
Because I'm going to make sure that the last

1510
01:08:20,863 --> 01:08:24,447
Breath out of my mouth no woman is brutalized by the people that are being

1511
01:08:24,703 --> 01:08:25,215
Brutalized

1512
01:08:25,471 --> 01:08:30,335
Rape murder in Europe okay and no says anything

1513
01:08:31,615 --> 01:08:33,151
He was doing so good for you

1514
01:08:33,407 --> 01:08:36,223
No I don't want

1515
01:08:36,479 --> 01:08:42,623
He was doing great and then he said that you're a partner like that you're on that site

1516
01:08:49,791 --> 01:08:55,935
Hey

1517
01:08:57,983 --> 01:09:01,567
The similarity to the Alex always going on and on about how we need to arm women

1518
01:09:01,823 --> 01:09:02,335
Is

1519
01:09:02,847 --> 01:09:03,359
Also

1520
01:09:05,407 --> 01:09:06,431
Women want Guns automatic

1521
01:09:06,687 --> 01:09:07,967
But I'm not going to jack off about it

1522
01:09:09,247 --> 01:09:12,831
We're going to let them have the choice to have gone

1523
01:09:13,343 --> 01:09:13,855
I'm pro-choice

1524
01:09:14,111 --> 01:09:14,879
With women having gun

1525
01:09:15,903 --> 01:09:18,207
The other

1526
01:09:18,719 --> 01:09:19,487
Then there was

1527
01:09:21,023 --> 01:09:22,815
You know you need that you're right in your left hand

1528
01:09:23,327 --> 01:09:24,095
You have your last name

1529
01:09:24,607 --> 01:09:25,375
We have your prepping

1530
01:09:25,631 --> 01:09:27,935
Engineer

1531
01:09:28,191 --> 01:09:28,703
By the way

1532
01:09:28,959 --> 01:09:29,727
Double bonus

1533
01:09:34,847 --> 01:09:37,407
Most people aren't ambidextrous

1534
01:09:37,663 --> 01:09:40,479
You got the other hand is kind of a waste

1535
01:09:40,991 --> 01:09:43,295
For the most part. Okay

1536
01:09:43,551 --> 01:09:44,319
You know all that prepping

1537
01:09:44,831 --> 01:09:45,343
What is largely away

1538
01:09:48,415 --> 01:09:48,927
I get it

1539
01:09:49,183 --> 01:09:51,743
I see what you doing now

1540
01:09:54,559 --> 01:09:55,839
You hate left-handed people

1541
01:09:56,607 --> 01:09:57,887
Why did you do that

1542
01:09:58,143 --> 01:09:58,911
But why did

1543
01:09:59,167 --> 01:10:02,751
Did you force people

1544
01:10:03,007 --> 01:10:04,031
Locust

1545
01:10:05,055 --> 01:10:05,567
I would argue

1546
01:10:05,823 --> 01:10:07,359
I would argue

1547
01:10:08,895 --> 01:10:09,407
If your left hand

1548
01:10:10,431 --> 01:10:11,711
You everyone should have one hand

1549
01:10:12,223 --> 01:10:12,991
That's what I'm saying

1550
01:10:14,015 --> 01:10:19,391
I'm sites

1551
01:10:19,647 --> 01:10:25,791
And it should be attached to the water

1552
01:10:27,071 --> 01:10:29,119
Imagine whatever day of the week it is

1553
01:10:29,887 --> 01:10:31,167
The power goes down

1554
01:10:31,679 --> 01:10:32,191
Call bank

1555
01:10:32,447 --> 01:10:36,287
What if he 8:30 p.m. car do not work they go to pump gas

1556
01:10:36,543 --> 01:10:37,055
There's no gas

1557
01:10:37,311 --> 01:10:40,639
Cuz you can't f*** with no power

1558
01:10:41,151 --> 01:10:42,431
You could be Virgie broadcast

1559
01:10:42,687 --> 01:10:43,199
Nation comes on

1560
01:10:43,455 --> 01:10:44,991

01:10:45,247 --> 01:10:48,063
Unforeseen circumstances us Cyber attack on Iran

1562
01:10:48,319 --> 01:10:48,831
Structure

1563
01:10:49,343 --> 01:10:49,855
They're going

1564
01:10:50,111 --> 01:10:50,879
To generate

1565
01:10:51,135 --> 01:10:51,647
The Prof

1566
01:10:52,159 --> 01:10:54,207
That they will provide the solution for

1567
01:10:54,463 --> 01:10:55,487
Call Becky Italian dialect

1568
01:10:55,999 --> 01:10:57,791
And then we will be brought under

1569
01:10:58,047 --> 01:11:01,887
The control remember that it's all about control it's all about

1570
01:11:02,143 --> 01:11:02,911

1572
01:11:06,495 --> 01:11:09,311
Man all the messages being put out

1573
01:11:09,567 --> 01:11:15,711
Synchronized essentially throughout all of this world

1574
01:11:15,967 --> 01:11:20,575
Magic for the horrible Christianity that I was raised in

1575
01:11:20,831 --> 01:11:26,975
Oh well at least they f****** talked about the Bible or some s*** whenever I was growing up this is about cyborg

1576
01:11:31,583 --> 01:11:35,679
But I feel like a piece of that is actually what kind of got me a little bit but I was

1577
01:11:36,191 --> 01:11:39,519
And I like about it watching this exactly what happened

1578
01:11:40,799 --> 01:11:41,823
This is a clip that

1579
01:11:42,335 --> 01:11:42,847
Play Ventura

1580
01:11:45,919 --> 01:11:46,431
Harken back

1581
01:11:47,455 --> 01:11:48,991
Like my religious deism

1582
01:11:49,247 --> 01:11:50,271
There's some things were easier

1583
01:11:51,039 --> 01:11:51,551
I was a kid

1584
01:11:54,623 --> 01:11:58,207
Watching this evoke

1585
01:12:02,047 --> 01:12:07,423
Wildly prefer people believing weird s*** and then holding snakes instead of them being like

1586
01:12:07,679 --> 01:12:09,215
You know the government's making chimera

1587
01:12:09,471 --> 01:12:13,567
Alright alright

1588
01:12:17,663 --> 01:12:18,431
Snakes theme song

1589
01:12:19,199 --> 01:12:25,343
Exactly exactly like you're crazy but I think you mean it you mean it

1590
01:12:25,599 --> 01:12:26,111

1595
01:12:30,207 --> 01:12:31,231
No I'm very much now

1596
01:12:31,487 --> 01:12:32,255

01:12:32,511 --> 01:12:33,791
Cut it as a

1598
01:12:34,303 --> 01:12:34,815

I probably could make it as dollar needed

1601
01:12:43,519 --> 01:12:46,079
He decided to take a little bit of a shortcut which is

1602
01:12:46,591 --> 01:12:50,175
Reading up on mythologies and stuff like that and trying to find ways to

1603
01:12:50,687 --> 01:12:51,199

Depression and what-have-you

1609
01:12:58,111 --> 01:13:00,415
Link yourself up with the right-wing real hard and

1681
01:16:30,335 --> 01:16:31,359
I am

1682
01:16:32,639 --> 01:16:33,151
An assassin

1683
01:16:33,663 --> 01:16:34,687
I get that

1684
01:16:35,199 --> 01:16:36,735
And by the way he sent his son to Bibles

1685
01:16:37,247 --> 01:16:39,551
Even though he was the most profane man I've ever met

1686
01:16:39,807 --> 01:16:42,367
But he said even as hard as my heart was

1687
01:16:42,623 --> 01:16:43,391
When you see

1688
01:16:43,647 --> 01:16:44,671
Human-animal High

1689
01:16:45,439 --> 01:16:45,951
That was once

1690
01:16:46,207 --> 01:16:46,719
Strictly humor

1691
01:16:47,231 --> 01:16:48,767
And people do that

1692
01:16:49,023 --> 01:16:50,303
If you see in the headline

1693
01:16:52,607 --> 01:16:53,119
In all

1694
01:16:53,375 --> 01:16:54,911
States in our country are

1695
01:16:59,775 --> 01:17:05,919
Beat to the rebuttal you can't do that

1696
01:17:06,175 --> 01:17:08,991
And in every country

1697
01:17:12,063 --> 01:17:12,575
Angola

1698
01:17:12,831 --> 01:17:13,343
Doing it

1699
01:17:14,111 --> 01:17:14,879
Burkina Faso

1700
01:17:15,135 --> 01:17:17,951
I don't even know where that is but they're doing it

1701
01:17:18,207 --> 01:17:21,023
Capitals of Ouagadougou

1702
01:17:21,279 --> 01:17:22,047
Madagascar

1703
01:17:22,303 --> 01:17:24,095
Okay Madagascar actually they are

1704
01:17:25,119 --> 01:17:31,263
Madagascar is a study on Evolution and island nations and how you can see the flower

1705
01:17:32,287 --> 01:17:35,871
Species that would go on the Instinct and otherwise places everything

1706
01:17:36,127 --> 01:17:38,431
Fantastic

1707
01:17:38,687 --> 01:17:44,831
Play Chris Rock David Schwimmer movie was actually a documentary all those animals in Madagascar were chimeras

1708
01:17:45,087 --> 01:17:51,231
Chris Rock has been in

1709
01:17:51,487 --> 01:17:51,999
All time

1710
01:17:52,255 --> 01:17:53,791
Of course

1711
01:17:54,047 --> 01:17:56,351
Bigger and more chimeran

1712
01:17:57,631 --> 01:17:59,423
What all right

1713
01:18:00,191 --> 01:18:01,727
I can't

1714
01:18:03,007 --> 01:18:03,775
You know

1715
01:18:04,031 --> 01:18:07,359
It's one of those things you know

1716
01:18:07,615 --> 01:18:11,199
Alright you on the show there's another guy who's a guest is name is David like

1717
01:18:11,455 --> 01:18:17,599
He's a preacher but he is mostly silent wow Steve Quayle Steve rolls over everybody

1718
01:18:17,855 --> 01:18:18,367
God intend

1719
01:18:18,623 --> 01:18:20,671
But he gets to say a little bit here

1720
01:18:20,927 --> 01:18:21,951
I'm at this

1721
01:18:22,463 --> 01:18:22,975
F******

1722
01:18:23,231 --> 01:18:23,743
So laughing

1723
01:18:27,071 --> 01:18:29,119
It's telling you to get prepared

1724
01:18:29,375 --> 01:18:29,887
It's all about Jesus

1725
01:18:31,167 --> 01:18:31,679
Folks

1726
01:18:32,191 --> 01:18:35,263
Antonyms of former pastor Pastor 27 years

1727
01:18:36,031 --> 01:18:37,055
I'm so tired

1728
01:18:37,567 --> 01:18:39,103
Alex pantywaist pastor

1729
01:18:39,359 --> 01:18:45,503
We won't preach anything

1730
01:18:45,759 --> 01:18:46,783
Politically correct

1731
01:18:48,575 --> 01:18:50,367
All they want is your money

1732
01:18:55,743 --> 01:18:58,047
The denominations got done with them

1733
01:19:01,375 --> 01:19:05,471
He brought us out of the Harlot

1734
01:19:05,983 --> 01:19:07,263
But I just want to warn both

1735
01:19:08,543 --> 01:19:09,055
Images laughing

1736
01:19:12,127 --> 01:19:18,271
I love I love a guy is a baker shows your money

1737
01:19:18,527 --> 01:19:24,671
Preachers just want your money

1738
01:19:29,535 --> 01:19:31,583
You find it within Infowars

1739
01:19:31,839 --> 01:19:32,607
That's where you find

1740
01:19:33,631 --> 01:19:35,423
Does mega mega churches ask

1741
01:19:35,679 --> 01:19:37,215
Skin for your money by the way

1742
01:19:37,471 --> 01:19:37,983
You can get a

1743
01:19:38,239 --> 01:19:42,847
Only $600 when you talk about megachurch

1744
01:19:43,103 --> 01:19:47,967
You don't get more Mega than this guy who has built a city around who

1745
01:19:48,223 --> 01:19:50,015
Lake is community Ozarks

1746
01:19:50,271 --> 01:19:51,551
Look in the middle of Missouri

1747
01:19:51,807 --> 01:19:54,367
Write as a p.o. box in Branson

1748
01:19:54,623 --> 01:19:55,135
Because

1749
01:19:55,391 --> 01:19:57,439
Is churches too far away

1750
01:19:57,951 --> 01:20:01,023
Doubt it is essentially an apocalyptic cult that's funny

1751
01:20:01,279 --> 01:20:03,839
Yeah I don't know one of those

1752
01:20:04,095 --> 01:20:07,167
Prosperity Gospel

1753
01:20:07,935 --> 01:20:12,543
Yes they told me it's a matter of

1754
01:20:12,799 --> 01:20:13,311
Actual

1755
01:20:13,567 --> 01:20:14,336
Poundage of money

1756
01:20:14,592 --> 01:20:17,152
Antimatter

1757
01:20:17,408 --> 01:20:20,736
Well certainly we're going to get to that

1758
01:20:20,992 --> 01:20:22,272
But it's more about like

1759
01:20:22,784 --> 01:20:24,064
He's created a world

1760
01:20:24,320 --> 01:20:29,184
Megachurch people they get in and get out and then go about their lavish lifestyles

1761
01:20:29,440 --> 01:20:31,232
Living mansions

1762
01:20:31,488 --> 01:20:33,792
Like God's

1763
01:20:34,048 --> 01:20:37,632
Extravagant lifestyle that their megachurch affords them but

1764
01:20:37,888 --> 01:20:38,656
I don't I think

1765
01:20:39,168 --> 01:20:41,472
From everything I can tell Jim Bakker seems to like

1766
01:20:42,240 --> 01:20:43,776
Have a comment

1767
01:20:44,032 --> 01:20:48,128
Yeah I don't know if he lives there all the time but it would be stupid if he didn't because

1768
01:20:48,384 --> 01:20:48,896
Like I said

1769
01:20:49,152 --> 01:20:49,920
Lori's house

1770
01:20:50,176 --> 01:20:50,944
Is Giant

1771
01:20:51,200 --> 01:20:53,248
Buildings are art

1772
01:20:53,504 --> 01:20:54,016
Giant

1773
01:20:54,272 --> 01:20:55,296
Huge

1774
01:20:55,808 --> 01:20:56,576
It's crazy

1775
01:20:57,088 --> 01:21:00,672
If you have the money to do this and live in a mansion somewhere else

1776
01:21:01,440 --> 01:21:01,952
I don't even want to

1777
01:21:02,208 --> 01:21:04,512
Considerate also why would he live anywhere else

1778
01:21:04,768 --> 01:21:08,608
You live in the only place where he's worshipped regular lamps

1779
01:21:08,864 --> 01:21:11,936
If he went anywhere else people be like

1780
01:21:12,960 --> 01:21:15,008
Or kick his ass

1781
01:21:15,264 --> 01:21:16,800
There's a lot of people who probably a really mad at him

1782
01:21:21,664 --> 01:21:22,176
He probably

1783
01:21:22,944 --> 01:21:25,760
It's probably a situation where the Ozarks are where you can hide

1784
01:21:26,016 --> 01:21:27,040
Yeah

1785
01:21:27,552 --> 01:21:28,064
To some extent

1786
01:21:28,320 --> 01:21:29,344
Senescence

1787
01:21:29,600 --> 01:21:31,904
I told you were going to get to poundage of food

1788
01:21:32,160 --> 01:21:35,744
How much pound

1789
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:39,072
Flesh this out but that last the guys talking about

1790
01:21:39,840 --> 01:21:40,352
The

1791
01:21:40,864 --> 01:21:41,888
These other piece

1792
01:21:42,144 --> 01:21:45,984
Preachers they just want your money in that stuff back to another of Alex's

1793
01:21:46,496 --> 01:21:47,008
Rhetorical

1794
01:21:48,032 --> 01:21:49,312
You people of what you're doing

1795
01:21:49,568 --> 01:21:51,360
Very good strategy in order to

1796
01:21:51,616 --> 01:21:52,128
Deflect

1797
01:21:52,384 --> 01:21:53,408
Criticism of yourself

1798
01:21:53,664 --> 01:21:55,456
When you're very obviously running

1799
01:21:55,712 --> 01:21:56,224
Scammed

1800
01:21:56,736 --> 01:21:58,528
Accuse people

1801
01:21:59,040 --> 01:22:01,088
Especially people who have nothing to do with what you're doing

1802
01:22:01,344 --> 01:22:01,856
Other preacher

1803
01:22:02,112 --> 01:22:07,744
It's preemptively saying I'm Rubber and you're glue that's that's what it is

1804
01:22:09,024 --> 01:22:09,792
Pound of haddock

1805
01:22:10,048 --> 01:22:10,560
In this clip

1806
01:22:10,816 --> 01:22:11,840
Jim Bakker

1807
01:22:12,096 --> 01:22:15,424
Sort of insinuate that you don't buy his food you'll be forced to take the mark

1808
01:22:16,192 --> 01:22:17,472
That sounds right

1809
01:22:17,984 --> 01:22:18,496
Ship gets

1810
01:22:18,752 --> 01:22:20,800
Weird

1811
01:22:22,336 --> 01:22:23,872
Yelp reviews for

1812
01:22:27,968 --> 01:22:28,480
Princeton

1813
01:22:31,296 --> 01:22:32,576
I've got a granddaughter who's

1814
01:22:32,832 --> 01:22:33,344
3

1815
01:22:34,112 --> 01:22:35,648
I've got a grandson

1816
01:22:35,904 --> 01:22:36,416
Who's

1817
01:22:36,672 --> 01:22:38,464
About three months

1818
01:22:41,280 --> 01:22:43,328
Nieces and nephews here now

1819
01:22:48,960 --> 01:22:49,984
But I would check it again

1820
01:22:51,264 --> 01:22:52,288
Define

1821
01:22:55,360 --> 01:22:57,408
And they're crying what am I going to do

1822
01:22:58,688 --> 01:23:00,480
What am I going to do

1823
01:23:00,992 --> 01:23:01,760
Who is

1824
01:23:02,272 --> 01:23:03,296
The joy of my heart

1825
01:23:04,064 --> 01:23:07,904
You all say well I'm strong

1826
01:23:14,560 --> 01:23:15,072
Alright

1827
01:23:16,864 --> 01:23:18,656
I'll believe that when I see it

1828
01:23:19,168 --> 01:23:19,680
Batman

1829
01:23:20,704 --> 01:23:21,728
But why

1830
01:23:25,568 --> 01:23:27,616
For years and years

1831
01:23:28,896 --> 01:23:29,664
Panda

1832
01:23:31,968 --> 01:23:32,992
Amiel's here

1833
01:23:33,248 --> 01:23:34,016
Morningside

1834
01:23:36,832 --> 01:23:37,856
About coming

1835
01:23:38,112 --> 01:23:38,624
Distill

1836
01:23:43,744 --> 01:23:44,256
Weird

1837
01:23:45,024 --> 01:23:46,048
That's where I go

1838
01:23:46,304 --> 01:23:49,632
Because I couldn't I couldn't quite tell what the guy said

1839
01:23:49,888 --> 01:23:50,656
But it wasn't good

1840
01:23:50,912 --> 01:23:54,496
There was something I come on man

1841
01:23:54,752 --> 01:23:55,520
Don't even

1842
01:23:55,776 --> 01:23:56,800
Try

1843
01:23:57,056 --> 01:23:59,104
Think about coming to steal my food

1844
01:23:59,616 --> 01:24:00,384
Why would I

1845
01:24:00,896 --> 01:24:04,480
It was the last thing on them if I was hungry

1846
01:24:08,064 --> 01:24:08,576
Well

1847
01:24:09,856 --> 01:24:10,880
Preach that again

1848
01:24:13,696 --> 01:24:16,256
Please

1849
01:24:19,328 --> 01:24:20,864
If

1850
01:24:24,192 --> 01:24:25,216
ER

1851
01:24:30,592 --> 01:24:33,920
So I found a review of the food

1852
01:24:34,176 --> 01:24:38,784
Apocalypse Chow where they try that.

1853
01:24:43,136 --> 01:24:45,696
Blind

1854
01:24:45,952 --> 01:24:47,488
Hear it in PR we tried the

1855
01:24:47,744 --> 01:24:48,512
The creamy potato soup

1856
01:24:48,768 --> 01:24:49,792
Macaroni elbows in

1857
01:24:50,048 --> 01:24:51,840
Powder and the chicken noodle soup

1858
01:24:52,096 --> 01:24:53,376
And of course we had to test

1859
01:24:53,632 --> 01:24:54,144
The chocolate pudding

1860
01:24:54,400 --> 01:24:55,424
For dessert

1861
01:24:57,984 --> 01:25:00,288
Extremely salty and had odd lingering aftertaste

1862
01:25:01,056 --> 01:25:05,408
We couldn't agree on which was worse the thick potato soup that felt like eating wet cement

1863
01:25:05,664 --> 01:25:08,480
The strong chemical overtones of the chocolate pudding or the

1864
01:25:08,736 --> 01:25:11,040
Disturbing radioactive orange of the macaroni and cheese

1865
01:25:11,552 --> 01:25:13,856
Pro-tip did not make a mistake we made of adding more

1866
01:25:14,112 --> 01:25:14,624
Portuguese.

1867
01:25:14,880 --> 01:25:16,160
Because work

1868
01:25:17,696 --> 01:25:19,232
I feel like that's on NPR

1869
01:25:19,488 --> 01:25:21,792
Liberals run

1870
01:25:23,584 --> 01:25:24,864
It's awful

1871
01:25:25,120 --> 01:25:29,472
It's trash Greg lauro of Brooklyn New York tells basalt

1872
01:25:33,056 --> 01:25:35,616
November video for sploid Loro Cooks

1873
01:25:35,872 --> 01:25:37,152
Taste test several dishes

1874
01:25:37,408 --> 01:25:43,040
From baker's revivalist Buck Italian marinara the potato soup

1875
01:25:43,296 --> 01:25:46,624
Black bean burger stroganoff and chocolate pudding they taste

1876
01:25:46,880 --> 01:25:51,488
He says like cooked paper mache a bathroom at a bar at the end of the night in the college

1877
01:25:51,744 --> 01:25:54,304
I'm simply one of the worst things I've ever eaten in my life

1878
01:25:55,072 --> 01:25:58,144
Frank Davis is the founder of food for health International one of the two companies

1879
01:25:58,656 --> 01:25:59,424
The manufacturer the food for the

1880
01:25:59,680 --> 01:26:00,192
Jim Bakker

1881
01:26:00,448 --> 01:26:00,960
Show

1882
01:26:01,216 --> 01:26:06,848
He takes issue with Laura brutal critique of throttle

1883
01:26:12,736 --> 01:26:13,248
40 Years War

1884
01:26:13,504 --> 01:26:14,784
When stored and ideal basement lights

1885
01:26:15,040 --> 01:26:16,320
Conditioned hunger is the best

1886
01:26:16,832 --> 01:26:19,136
It's not crucial to you not

1887
01:26:19,392 --> 01:26:19,904
To use anything

1888
01:26:20,160 --> 01:26:20,928
Mickey go rancid like

1889
01:26:23,744 --> 01:26:24,768
Even though animals

1890
01:26:25,024 --> 01:26:26,048
Make a cheaper more flavorful

1891
01:26:26,560 --> 01:26:28,096
There's no way that will work

1892
01:26:29,376 --> 01:26:30,144
Korean baseball

1893
01:26:30,400 --> 01:26:32,448
Not all products are vegetarian

1894
01:26:32,704 --> 01:26:33,472
Many like the answer

1895
01:26:33,728 --> 01:26:34,496
The potatoes have rendered

1896
01:26:35,264 --> 01:26:37,568
Creamy stroganoff ingredients list a vegetarian

1897
01:26:38,080 --> 01:26:38,592
Bass

1898
01:26:39,104 --> 01:26:39,872
Bubba Bubba

1899
01:26:42,432 --> 01:26:43,968
It's all Quote this is the chef

1900
01:26:44,224 --> 01:26:44,736
Loro

1901
01:26:44,992 --> 01:26:47,552
It's off-putting Baker is trying to sell this stuff on its

1902
01:26:48,064 --> 01:26:48,832
It doesn't look or taste

1903
01:26:49,088 --> 01:26:50,112
Anything like he advertise

1904
01:26:51,392 --> 01:26:52,416
So there's that

1905
01:26:53,952 --> 01:26:56,000
I don't know if your years worth of food

1906
01:26:56,256 --> 01:26:56,768
47

1907
01:26:57,280 --> 01:26:58,560
It's not

1908
01:26:59,328 --> 01:27:00,096
No

1909
01:27:00,352 --> 01:27:00,864
That's just

1910
01:27:02,912 --> 01:27:05,984
I mean if you're already predisposed to buying a Year's worth of food

1911
01:27:06,496 --> 01:27:09,056
I don't think taste is big on your on your list

1912
01:27:09,824 --> 01:27:10,336
Priority

1913
01:27:11,616 --> 01:27:17,760
Probably not because the point of this food is you haven't been able to eat

1914
01:27:18,016 --> 01:27:21,600
Just looking for a calorie

1915
01:27:22,112 --> 01:27:23,648
Go for it

1916
01:27:23,904 --> 01:27:24,928
But at the same time

1917
01:27:30,304 --> 01:27:31,072
Food as food

1918
01:27:31,328 --> 01:27:33,376
Write using these pricks

1919
01:27:33,632 --> 01:27:35,168
Fear in order to

1920
01:27:35,680 --> 01:27:39,008
To sell the food

1921
01:27:39,520 --> 01:27:40,544
Clip from one of his commercial

1922
01:27:41,056 --> 01:27:41,824
On this episode

1923
01:27:42,080 --> 01:27:44,128
That I found jarring and it was because

1924
01:27:44,640 --> 01:27:45,664
So indicative of

1925
01:27:45,920 --> 01:27:46,432
Every

1926
01:27:47,968 --> 01:27:48,480
Telemark

1927
01:27:48,736 --> 01:27:50,784
Televangelist

1928
01:27:52,064 --> 01:27:55,648
So do it today we know we don't know what

1929
01:27:55,904 --> 01:27:57,440
The future brings

1930
01:27:57,696 --> 01:27:58,208
But

1931
01:27:58,720 --> 01:28:02,816
We can be ready for the future

1932
01:28:03,072 --> 01:28:08,192
That I believe you haven't done it

1933
01:28:08,448 --> 01:28:14,592
But I believe that God is really speaking to someone someone be prepared and if you

1934
01:28:14,848 --> 01:28:16,640
You haven't even started

1935
01:28:16,896 --> 01:28:21,248
Maybe today is the day you need to order that seven years of food

1936
01:28:22,272 --> 01:28:23,040
You'll not

1937
01:28:23,296 --> 01:28:24,576
Be disappointed

1938
01:28:25,088 --> 01:28:26,112
If you prepare

1939
01:28:26,368 --> 01:28:29,184
Wait we have to get back to our program right now

1940
01:28:29,696 --> 01:28:30,208
Yeah I got to go

1941
01:28:31,488 --> 01:28:32,512
I will

1942
01:28:32,768 --> 01:28:35,584
Commercial for a product that I was like

1943
01:28:36,096 --> 01:28:37,376
I mean that's out of my price range

1944
01:28:37,632 --> 01:28:38,400
But that's pretty cool

1945
01:28:39,936 --> 01:28:43,520
Generator look at fuelless generator that they sell for like $3,000

1946
01:28:43,776 --> 01:28:47,104
Oh yeah but it looks really cool like

1947
01:28:47,360 --> 01:28:48,384
Cuz you eat we can do is you

1948
01:28:48,640 --> 01:28:49,920
You can hook it up to solar panels

1949
01:28:50,432 --> 01:28:52,480
They comes with a couple solar panels you can hook up

1950
01:28:52,736 --> 01:28:54,016
Come to the back

1951
01:28:54,272 --> 01:28:54,784
Apparently

1952
01:28:55,040 --> 01:28:55,552
Allegedly

1953
01:28:56,832 --> 01:28:57,344
2 hours

1954
01:28:57,600 --> 01:28:58,880
With the solar panel

1955
01:28:59,136 --> 01:29:01,952
You know there's other ways to power it like

1956
01:29:02,208 --> 01:29:04,768
You can find Outlet you can

1957
01:29:05,024 --> 01:29:06,560
But his like USB ports

1958
01:29:07,072 --> 01:29:07,840
It has like gopher

1959
01:29:08,096 --> 01:29:08,608
4 phones

1960
01:29:09,120 --> 01:29:10,656
It's got a bunch

1961
01:29:12,448 --> 01:29:18,592
I want one of those what I'm saying

1962
01:29:18,848 --> 01:29:21,920
Smaller version of that would be amazing for like Tampa

1963
01:29:22,176 --> 01:29:28,320
You know what I'd forgotten the generators and probably come a long way since I've ever consider

1964
01:29:28,576 --> 01:29:32,160
Wasn't even the product they're selling it's like

1965
01:29:32,416 --> 01:29:38,560
USB

1966
01:29:40,352 --> 01:29:42,656
So now I really want to generate

1967
01:29:45,728 --> 01:29:46,496
Feeder

1968
01:29:46,752 --> 01:29:47,776
And then we will power outage

1969
01:29:48,800 --> 01:29:49,568
Wrap up with

1970
01:29:51,872 --> 01:29:54,432
In the last

1971
01:29:55,456 --> 01:29:59,296
We want to live in the city

1972
01:30:02,880 --> 01:30:03,648
Sunnyside

1973
01:30:09,024 --> 01:30:10,560
Yea or

1974
01:30:10,816 --> 01:30:11,840
Or something

1975
01:30:12,864 --> 01:30:13,888
Morningside

1976
01:30:18,240 --> 01:30:19,008
I want to tell you

1977
01:30:19,264 --> 01:30:20,032
1 minutes

1978
01:30:33,856 --> 01:30:34,368
Something

1979
01:30:34,624 --> 01:30:36,672
What they want

1980
01:30:38,464 --> 01:30:39,232
Holding

1981
01:30:40,256 --> 01:30:41,536
A roast turkey in her hand

1982
01:30:41,792 --> 01:30:43,584
Then they want it on it

1983
01:30:43,840 --> 01:30:44,864
Grandma

1984
01:30:45,120 --> 01:30:45,632
Head off

1985
01:30:45,888 --> 01:30:46,400
Yep

1986
01:30:46,912 --> 01:30:48,192
Turkey

1987
01:30:50,752 --> 01:30:52,800
What people are hungry and then there's

1988
01:30:53,056 --> 01:30:54,080
Converted

1989
01:30:54,336 --> 01:30:57,664
They're going to take what they want

1990
01:30:58,176 --> 01:30:59,712
Jesus allows you to not feel

1991
01:31:00,224 --> 01:31:01,760
Also

1992
01:31:02,016 --> 01:31:08,160
I'm not so I made sure certainly get a hypothetical gang members that are certainly using racist

1993
01:31:08,416 --> 01:31:10,976
Beer to deport in prison

1994
01:31:11,232 --> 01:31:14,304
Yes

1995
01:31:20,704 --> 01:31:23,520
Highway

1996
01:31:23,776 --> 01:31:29,920
I was in a prison cell with prison cell

1997
01:31:30,176 --> 01:31:36,064
You're too rich old con man in a minimum-security prison gangs were you in

1998
01:31:36,320 --> 01:31:37,344
Stupid credibility

1999
01:31:37,600 --> 01:31:40,672
Now the idea do Demi he's just using classic racer

2000
01:31:41,184 --> 01:31:45,792
We are basically the marauding minorities

2001
01:31:48,096 --> 01:31:49,376
Everyone leaves everyone

2002
01:31:51,936 --> 01:31:54,752
I don't think it's great of a game wants to behead your grandma for a turkey

2003
01:31:55,520 --> 01:31:57,824
Or chicken or whatever you're saying roast chicken

2004
01:31:58,592 --> 01:31:59,616
Probably

2005
01:31:59,872 --> 01:32:00,384
Better taste

2006
01:32:00,640 --> 01:32:03,456
I will say actively what Jim Bakker does as a

2007
01:32:03,712 --> 01:32:04,224
The career

2008
01:32:04,480 --> 01:32:07,296
Is talking that old woman into giving away her turkey

2009
01:32:07,808 --> 01:32:09,344
Or chicken

2010
01:32:09,600 --> 01:32:13,696
He is just using a different tactic in order to get the exact same thing

2011
01:32:13,952 --> 01:32:14,464
The Gangs do

2012
01:32:14,720 --> 01:32:16,512
He uses emotional manipulation

2013
01:32:16,768 --> 01:32:20,608
Fear of religious s*** that's all made up and apparently Giants

2014
01:32:21,120 --> 01:32:23,424
In order to trick grandma in

2015
01:32:23,680 --> 01:32:25,728
What she can't afford

2016
01:32:26,240 --> 01:32:29,056
Violence

2017
01:32:29,312 --> 01:32:31,360
To take your grandmother

2018
01:32:31,616 --> 01:32:36,736
And I will only use the 300 Violin fridge

2019
01:32:37,248 --> 01:32:40,064
I am a good man that actually make sense

2020
01:32:41,344 --> 01:32:42,624
Don't buy my food

2021
01:32:43,136 --> 01:32:45,440
Buy a home in my community

2022
01:32:45,696 --> 01:32:46,720
Where I have millions of

2023
01:32:47,232 --> 01:32:49,536
Right that's the only way that makes sense

2024
01:32:49,792 --> 01:32:51,584
Because you're safe in his

2025
01:32:52,352 --> 01:32:53,632
Apparently everyone has guns

2026
01:32:53,888 --> 01:32:55,680
Well-armed.

2027
01:32:56,448 --> 01:32:56,960
I don't know

2028
01:32:57,216 --> 01:33:00,800
I hate this guy I am feeling so

2029
01:33:01,056 --> 01:33:01,568
Terrible

2030
01:33:02,592 --> 01:33:03,872
Like legitimately

2031
01:33:04,640 --> 01:33:05,920
I am offended

2032
01:33:06,176 --> 01:33:08,736
As the 10-year old Christian boy that I was

2033
01:33:09,248 --> 01:33:15,392
Come on

2034
01:33:15,648 --> 01:33:21,280
Christianity is the f****** worse in organized religion is killing all of us but for some reason like there's that

2035
01:33:22,816 --> 01:33:27,680
Like no matter how old you grow or how your opinion change like there's that ten-year-old

2036
01:33:28,448 --> 01:33:31,520
Part of you that was raised that you're never going to be able to scratch

2037
01:33:31,776 --> 01:33:32,544
Completely away

2038
01:33:32,800 --> 01:33:34,080
And 10 year old me is like

2039
01:33:34,592 --> 01:33:39,712
This is a terrible interpretation of the Bible are spitting on Jesus's face

2040
01:33:39,968 --> 01:33:44,320
You should be ashamed of yourself and when I come

2041
01:33:44,576 --> 01:33:49,952
You will burn in hell for eternity Jim Bakker and the only reason that you would do this

2042
01:33:50,208 --> 01:33:51,488
Is if you knew

2043
01:33:51,744 --> 01:33:53,024
100%

2044
01:33:53,280 --> 01:33:55,072
God wasn't real

2045
01:33:55,328 --> 01:33:56,864
The way he behaves is Sosa

2046
01:33:57,376 --> 01:34:00,960
Brutal

2047
01:34:01,216 --> 01:34:04,032
I don't understand how you get to that moral play

2048
01:34:04,288 --> 01:34:05,568
I'd like

2049
01:34:05,824 --> 01:34:06,592
It sucks because

2050
01:34:06,848 --> 01:34:08,640
A lot of the victims are probably well mean

2051
01:34:08,896 --> 01:34:09,664
People who aren't

2052
01:34:09,920 --> 01:34:15,808
That cynical

2053
01:34:16,064 --> 01:34:17,088
But like there

2054
01:34:18,624 --> 01:34:19,904
I know that my grandma buys a lot

2055
01:34:20,160 --> 01:34:20,928
All the stuff off at QVC

2056
01:34:22,464 --> 01:34:25,024
I'm not sure if she still does but like I would get these horrible

2057
01:34:25,280 --> 01:34:25,792
Stupid Christian

2058
01:34:26,048 --> 01:34:26,560
Some gift

2059
01:34:26,816 --> 01:34:27,584
But you would sound like

2060
01:34:27,840 --> 01:34:28,352
1

2061
01:34:28,608 --> 01:34:30,144
Two years in a row for Christmas

2062
01:34:30,400 --> 01:34:30,912
For my birthday

2063
01:34:31,936 --> 01:34:33,984
She sent me a book that was a tour guide to heaven

2064
01:34:34,496 --> 01:34:35,520
I was just about like

2065
01:34:36,800 --> 01:34:40,640
Yeah like in the structure of like

2066
01:34:40,896 --> 01:34:42,688
Is it was a hotel that you were going to

2067
01:34:42,944 --> 01:34:49,088
Gold

2068
01:34:49,600 --> 01:34:53,440
Even bother to disabuse you of your boat

2069
01:34:55,488 --> 01:34:58,816
Cool cool

2070
01:34:59,072 --> 01:34:59,584
The same thing

2071
01:35:02,656 --> 01:35:04,960
To being religious.

2072
01:35:05,216 --> 01:35:06,496
Volvo misguided there's like

2073
01:35:06,752 --> 01:35:09,824
I believe we're going to go to hell if you don't do these rights

2074
01:35:11,872 --> 01:35:12,640
Achieved

2075
01:35:12,896 --> 01:35:14,432
No acted out on it poorly

2076
01:35:14,688 --> 01:35:15,200
But

2077
01:35:15,456 --> 01:35:18,784
The people on the next level people selling the books that are used as

2078
01:35:19,040 --> 01:35:20,064
Unfortunately

2079
01:35:20,320 --> 01:35:21,088
Araucana

2080
01:35:21,856 --> 01:35:22,624
People below them

2081
01:35:22,880 --> 01:35:24,928
And I think that's actually the case with almost every

2082
01:35:25,184 --> 01:35:26,976
Church

2083
01:35:27,232 --> 01:35:33,376
I think you get the more sincere thing probably are the higher up people kind of realize that is a business

2084
01:35:34,912 --> 01:35:36,448
Because it is

2085
01:35:36,960 --> 01:35:39,520
Something that they themselves

2086
01:35:41,568 --> 01:35:43,360
I don't know I don't know what I don't know

2087
01:35:43,616 --> 01:35:49,760
Enough about

2088
01:35:50,016 --> 01:35:50,784
Play Church

2089
01:35:51,040 --> 01:35:52,832
That had the that had

2090
01:35:54,368 --> 01:35:55,648
In my small town

2091
01:35:55,904 --> 01:35:56,416
Growing up

2092
01:35:56,672 --> 01:35:57,696
I had to

2093
01:35:57,952 --> 01:35:59,488
World rocking events

2094
01:35:59,744 --> 01:36:00,256
In the Christian

2095
01:36:01,024 --> 01:36:02,048
1 Nugent

2096
01:36:03,072 --> 01:36:04,096
Woman pastor

2097
01:36:05,120 --> 01:36:05,632
Everybody

2098
01:36:05,888 --> 01:36:06,656
Talking about

2099
01:36:06,912 --> 01:36:07,936
Is quite a everybody

2100
01:36:08,704 --> 01:36:09,472
5 years later

2101
01:36:13,824 --> 01:36:14,336
Holetown

2102
01:36:14,848 --> 01:36:19,712
This is cultural Marxism slippery slope of subjectivism

2103
01:36:20,480 --> 01:36:20,992
But that's

2104
01:36:21,248 --> 01:36:22,784
That's the thing to me

2105
01:36:23,040 --> 01:36:24,576
Christianity exemplifies

2106
01:36:24,832 --> 01:36:25,344
The worst

2107
01:36:25,600 --> 01:36:30,464
Thing and that's the thing that they argue and they bitching about all the time which is

2108
01:36:30,720 --> 01:36:33,280
The idea that it is the Smart versus

2109
01:36:33,536 --> 01:36:34,048
Does the dumb

2110
01:36:35,072 --> 01:36:38,400
Like that's what Christians always fight against like that the idea

2111
01:36:38,656 --> 01:36:39,680
You can't go to college

2112
01:36:40,192 --> 01:36:41,984
You can't don't go to the colleges

2113
01:36:42,240 --> 01:36:43,776
Because they're fighting against you

2114
01:36:47,616 --> 01:36:50,432
And they're using the fact that you're not

2115
01:36:50,688 --> 01:36:51,456
Capable

2116
01:36:51,712 --> 01:36:52,224
Really

2117
01:36:52,736 --> 01:36:53,248
Of looking

2118
01:36:54,272 --> 01:36:54,784
Cuz you're dumb

2119
01:36:55,552 --> 01:36:56,064
Your

2120
01:36:57,600 --> 01:36:58,112
That's what it is

2121
01:36:58,624 --> 01:37:00,160
And that lesbian pastor

2122
01:37:01,184 --> 01:37:02,464
Exemplifies to me

2123
01:37:03,488 --> 01:37:04,000
Believing

2124
01:37:04,512 --> 01:37:05,792
I'd like actually believing

2125
01:37:06,048 --> 01:37:09,120
Because if you are a lesbian and you believe in

2126
01:37:10,400 --> 01:37:11,168
Christianity

2127
01:37:11,936 --> 01:37:13,216
F*** you gotta believe it

2128
01:37:13,984 --> 01:37:17,056
You got to believe that it's real true otherwise

2129
01:37:17,312 --> 01:37:22,176
Otherwise damn you are aligning yourself with the entire organ is trying to murder you

2130
01:37:22,432 --> 01:37:25,248
Yeah you know that's a good point

2131
01:37:25,504 --> 01:37:28,064
That's cuz that's what this is It's the smart versus

2132
01:37:28,320 --> 01:37:30,112
The dumb knowing

2133
01:37:30,368 --> 01:37:32,928
That you're too stupid to see through this s***

2134
01:37:33,184 --> 01:37:34,464
And if you had even though

2135
01:37:34,976 --> 01:37:37,280
The slightest modicum

2136
01:37:37,792 --> 01:37:39,584
Critical thinking skills

2137
01:37:40,096 --> 01:37:41,376
You would look at this and go

2138
01:37:41,888 --> 01:37:44,960
Wow is that dumb then it's the same thing with Alex Jones

2139
01:37:45,216 --> 01:37:47,008
Which is why he always says

2140
01:37:47,264 --> 01:37:48,800
They think you're stupid

2141
01:37:49,056 --> 01:37:52,640
Knows he's playing on

2142
01:37:53,408 --> 01:37:53,920
Securities

2143
01:37:54,176 --> 01:37:54,944
And those same

2144
01:37:55,456 --> 01:37:55,968
Speeded feeling

2145
01:37:56,224 --> 01:37:57,504
The people have is not one

2146
01:37:57,760 --> 01:37:58,272
The dumps

2147
01:37:58,528 --> 01:38:00,064
And most people aren't as dumb

2148
01:38:00,576 --> 01:38:01,088
A lot of people thing

2149
01:38:01,600 --> 01:38:02,112
I guess I don't know

2150
01:38:02,624 --> 01:38:05,696
I have no idea how to make a broad generalization Uno

2151
01:38:06,464 --> 01:38:08,000
Another employee

2152
01:38:08,768 --> 01:38:09,280
Jim Bakker

2153
01:38:11,328 --> 01:38:16,448
No I wish the song

2154
01:38:18,496 --> 01:38:20,032
Someone I got to say looks like she

2155
01:38:20,288 --> 01:38:20,800
She's 14

2156
01:38:21,056 --> 01:38:21,824
I don't think

2157
01:38:22,080 --> 01:38:24,640
She is a really important question

2158
01:38:25,152 --> 01:38:27,200
Before you can

2159
01:38:27,712 --> 01:38:33,856
I know you're trying to get a clap and I'm doing that thing where I interrupted light clips

2160
01:38:34,112 --> 01:38:34,880
Premier I'm sorry

2161
01:38:36,672 --> 01:38:37,696
Is the music any good

2162
01:38:38,208 --> 01:38:39,744
I know I did you know why

2163
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:42,816
Here's the thing the video that they put out don't often have

2164
01:38:43,072 --> 01:38:43,584
The band

2165
01:38:43,840 --> 01:38:44,352
Playing in it

2166
01:38:45,120 --> 01:38:45,888
What the f***

2167
01:38:46,656 --> 01:38:47,424
Well you just need to hear

2168
01:38:47,680 --> 01:38:48,448
Steve talk about giant

2169
01:38:48,960 --> 01:38:49,472
What the f***

2170
01:38:49,728 --> 01:38:54,848
What is the time song

2171
01:38:55,104 --> 01:39:01,248
You have different perspectives on

2172
01:39:02,272 --> 01:39:03,552
Not true

2173
01:39:04,064 --> 01:39:06,112
My youth group

2174
01:39:12,512 --> 01:39:13,280
Guitar bass

2175
01:39:13,792 --> 01:39:16,352
All that stuff I was just a vehicle for the

2176
01:39:16,608 --> 01:39:17,120
I guess

2177
01:39:17,376 --> 01:39:17,888
Probably like

2178
01:39:18,400 --> 01:39:22,752
Funny something-year-old music leader to be the frontman of a band

2179
01:39:24,032 --> 01:39:25,312
And so they did covers of like me

2180
01:39:25,568 --> 01:39:30,688
Meet Virginia

2181
01:39:30,944 --> 01:39:34,528
You just described every youth pastor in this entire f****** c***

2182
01:39:34,784 --> 01:39:40,928
Also except you didn't add him that he was guilty of sexually abusing children

2183
01:39:41,184 --> 01:39:41,952
Music leader

2184
01:39:42,208 --> 01:39:47,072
He was beating like a second-in-command actual youth pastor

2185
01:39:48,352 --> 01:39:50,400
Name

2186
01:39:52,960 --> 01:39:53,472
Well function

2187
01:39:53,728 --> 01:39:58,080
I don't know

2188
01:40:01,920 --> 01:40:05,504
Wish you would step back from that ledge my friend

2189
01:40:07,552 --> 01:40:11,904
Big youth group

2190
01:40:12,160 --> 01:40:15,744
It seems like there might have been like some sort of a worldwide religious

2191
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:21,632
Yes I got together and they're like these are the songs that are okay to cover and like time of your life

2192
01:40:21,888 --> 01:40:23,936
Everywhere everywhere

2193
01:40:24,192 --> 01:40:26,240
Didn't do that

2194
01:40:27,776 --> 01:40:29,568
The music guy but I think he probably thought that

2195
01:40:29,824 --> 01:40:30,592
Day was too hard

2196
01:40:30,848 --> 01:40:32,128
Something like that

2197
01:40:35,712 --> 01:40:37,504
Cricket

2198
01:40:37,760 --> 01:40:38,272
Sing song

2199
01:40:40,576 --> 01:40:44,672
I do but if you do do that then you run the risk

2200
01:40:45,184 --> 01:40:45,696
The kids fine

2201
01:40:47,744 --> 01:40:48,768
And then maybe

2202
01:40:49,024 --> 01:40:50,304
They'll find out what the word Duke

2203
01:40:50,816 --> 01:40:51,328
Right

2204
01:40:51,584 --> 01:40:53,120
But then totally fine.

2205
01:40:53,376 --> 01:40:53,888
Train

2206
01:40:56,448 --> 01:40:57,472
Third Eye Blind

2207
01:41:00,032 --> 01:41:01,056
Which song was trained

2208
01:41:02,592 --> 01:41:06,688
Drops of Jupiter

2209
01:41:06,944 --> 01:41:10,016
Drops of Jupiter that yeah yeah

2210
01:41:11,040 --> 01:41:12,832
So now we meet this employee

2211
01:41:16,928 --> 01:41:18,720
Lori's favorite employee

2212
01:41:25,120 --> 01:41:28,704
Would you take care of her

2213
01:41:30,752 --> 01:41:31,776
Would you say

2214
01:41:42,016 --> 01:41:45,856
If you are up there with your mom and dad

2215
01:41:46,624 --> 01:41:47,904
No matter what happened

2216
01:41:48,416 --> 01:41:49,440
You'd Survive

2217
01:41:54,560 --> 01:41:55,072
I know they wouldn't

2218
01:42:02,240 --> 01:42:05,568
Specific

2219
01:42:08,128 --> 01:42:11,712
I just I just like her response which is which might as well have been like

2220
01:42:12,736 --> 01:42:16,064
I'm not playing your game this is no.

2221
01:42:16,576 --> 01:42:18,624
Yeah I'm telling you she looks like she's 14

2222
01:42:18,880 --> 01:42:19,648
She's not

2223
01:42:19,904 --> 01:42:20,416
I know that

2224
01:42:20,672 --> 01:42:21,184
For another

2225
01:42:21,440 --> 01:42:22,976
Isn't that I'll explain tomorrow

2226
01:42:23,232 --> 01:42:24,000
But the

2227
01:42:24,256 --> 01:42:27,584
So the parents are there

2228
01:42:32,960 --> 01:42:34,496
All right I wasn't that boost

2229
01:42:37,056 --> 01:42:42,688
Not as many pounds is the potatoes not really but he's risen around with this guy about killing moose and living in Alaska

2230
01:42:44,224 --> 01:42:50,112
Different

2231
01:42:50,624 --> 01:42:51,136
Idea of meeting

2232
01:42:53,184 --> 01:42:56,512
Right so now the reason that she is there and they talked

2233
01:42:57,792 --> 01:42:59,328
Lori's favorite employee

2234
01:42:59,584 --> 01:43:00,864
Her parents are there

2235
01:43:01,376 --> 01:43:02,144
Kind of raping now

2236
01:43:02,400 --> 01:43:03,680
Or because the show ends

2237
01:43:03,936 --> 01:43:04,704
A video package

2238
01:43:05,472 --> 01:43:06,240
About her

2239
01:43:07,520 --> 01:43:08,032
Wait

2240
01:43:08,288 --> 01:43:08,800
Mike.

2241
01:43:10,080 --> 01:43:11,360
I think the exciting thing

2242
01:43:11,616 --> 01:43:14,944
About my daughter being in this program is really the personalities

2243
01:43:15,200 --> 01:43:17,248
Is really the people that have connected with her

2244
01:43:17,504 --> 01:43:19,040
Have invested into her

2245
01:43:19,296 --> 01:43:23,648
Have really given the time and the effort and the experience and

2246
01:43:23,904 --> 01:43:30,048
And so

2247
01:43:30,304 --> 01:43:36,448
I went anywhere else

2248
01:43:36,704 --> 01:43:42,848
Would it be fulfilling for calling

2249
01:43:43,104 --> 01:43:49,248
With some experience behind the camera some desire and info

2250
01:43:49,504 --> 01:43:52,832
Christian the net and found out that really her niches audio

2251
01:43:53,344 --> 01:43:58,976
So this goes on for a long time that music swells and at the end man is kicking in really got me

2252
01:43:59,232 --> 01:44:05,376
That swelling music over like the dad and the daughter talking about like having a good time in life

2253
01:44:05,632 --> 01:44:09,728
No this is an ESPN 30 for 30 of a tennis player whatever it is

2254
01:44:09,984 --> 01:44:11,520
Do you understand what's going on here

2255
01:44:12,032 --> 01:44:15,360
Jim Bakker is straight-up charging people to indoctrinate their children

2256
01:44:15,616 --> 01:44:20,224
Teach them how to use specific technology that his show uses then turn them into employees

2257
01:44:20,480 --> 01:44:24,064
Under the guise of something he calls Morningside School of media

2258
01:44:24,320 --> 01:44:24,832
What

2259
01:44:30,464 --> 01:44:31,488
Yeah buddy

2260
01:44:33,792 --> 01:44:34,816
The moment I Heard a Voice

2261
01:44:35,584 --> 01:44:36,352
You can look at my notes

2262
01:44:36,608 --> 01:44:37,376
The first thing I wrote was

2263
01:44:38,400 --> 01:44:38,912
F***** up

2264
01:44:39,168 --> 01:44:41,728
Udon and now I am

2265
01:44:41,984 --> 01:44:42,496
Furious

2266
01:44:44,032 --> 01:44:47,360
I think he's she looks like she's 14 15 16

2267
01:44:47,616 --> 01:44:51,456
It's tough for me to tell but I do know that from the website he doesn't allow anyone under age

2268
01:44:52,224 --> 01:44:54,528
Into the morning School

2269
01:44:55,040 --> 01:44:56,576
I'm at so at morning

2270
01:44:56,832 --> 01:44:57,344
This is

2271
01:44:57,600 --> 01:44:58,368
This is from their description

2272
01:44:58,880 --> 01:45:01,696
At Morningside School of media receive Hands-On training

2273
01:45:02,208 --> 01:45:04,000
Some of the best and brightest Minds in broadcasting

2274
01:45:04,256 --> 01:45:05,024
Dalmatian pointer

2275
01:45:05,536 --> 01:45:06,560
As you work alongside

2276
01:45:06,816 --> 01:45:08,096
Them to produce a National Leasing

2277
01:45:08,352 --> 01:45:11,424
Indicated television show you'll be learning how to use high-definition cameras

2278
01:45:11,680 --> 01:45:13,216
State-of-the-art audio equipment and

2279
01:45:13,472 --> 01:45:14,496
Professional editing software

2280
01:45:14,752 --> 01:45:15,776
Create content that airs

2281
01:45:16,032 --> 01:45:19,104
On the PTL television network in the Jim Bakker Show

2282
01:45:19,360 --> 01:45:20,896
This Hands-On approach will

2283
01:45:21,152 --> 01:45:22,176
Will will boy

2284
01:45:23,200 --> 01:45:27,808
The cut and paste ear and it said will you you a one-of-a-kind experience that cannot be found

2285
01:45:29,600 --> 01:45:30,368
You can't respond to book

2286
01:45:30,624 --> 01:45:32,160
Real schools

2287
01:45:32,416 --> 01:45:33,184
Also

2288
01:45:33,952 --> 01:45:40,096
I find I find it not to be an education when it's just send your kids here will give him a bed and then you can watch

2289
01:45:40,352 --> 01:45:44,704
They can watch us create the show and then eventually become the people who create the show

2290
01:45:45,472 --> 01:45:47,776
That actually less of a scam that a lot of

2291
01:45:48,032 --> 01:45:48,544
Reggae

2292
01:45:49,056 --> 01:45:50,336
It's not accredited

2293
01:45:50,592 --> 01:45:53,408
No I'm not saying it's accredited but but I

2294
01:45:53,664 --> 01:45:58,784
Spent my first semester in college was an audio production

2295
01:46:00,832 --> 01:46:02,368
If if it were that

2296
01:46:02,624 --> 01:46:04,160
It would be less of a scab that it was

2297
01:46:04,416 --> 01:46:06,976
I'm not with a scam

2298
01:46:07,232 --> 01:46:08,512
You can't learn some skills from

2299
01:46:08,768 --> 01:46:09,792
You'll have no degree

2300
01:46:10,304 --> 01:46:16,448
Know what you should do is just go to a audio production facility and jdola

2301
01:46:16,704 --> 01:46:18,752
Exactly

2302
01:46:19,008 --> 01:46:21,568
It's very clear to me that we have here the Peter Pan

2303
01:46:21,824 --> 01:46:22,336
Situation

2304
01:46:22,592 --> 01:46:24,128
Where does the Lost Children

2305
01:46:25,152 --> 01:46:26,688
Is there the one making the show

2306
01:46:26,944 --> 01:46:28,736
You will see that there's a cutaway

2307
01:46:28,992 --> 01:46:30,016
The go to the booth

2308
01:46:30,528 --> 01:46:36,672
When he's talking to her as like Laurie's favorite employee

2309
01:46:37,696 --> 01:46:42,560
Has a child Army that's running the show

2310
01:46:42,816 --> 01:46:43,328
Exaggeration

2311
01:46:43,584 --> 01:46:45,120
Peter Pan

2312
01:46:45,376 --> 01:46:49,472
No it's Peter Pan cuz she looks 14 and clearly 20

2313
01:46:50,496 --> 01:46:56,640
$5,500 a year to year program

2314
01:46:56,896 --> 01:47:00,480
A student becomes through his door

2315
01:47:00,992 --> 01:47:03,040
The FAQ

2316
01:47:03,296 --> 01:47:04,320
The school specifically state

2317
01:47:04,576 --> 01:47:05,344
Went

2318
01:47:05,600 --> 01:47:06,880
Discuss discuss

2319
01:47:08,160 --> 01:47:13,024
I think you specifically says this when discussing why they don't offer grants or scholarships at all

2320
01:47:14,560 --> 01:47:17,376
Quote what is the FAQ

2321
01:47:17,632 --> 01:47:22,496
Is Dan I am very curious almost will come to Morningside School

2322
01:47:22,752 --> 01:47:25,056
Prince story about God providing

2323
01:47:25,312 --> 01:47:30,432
Many of the support stories of Miracles and for that reason we agree with you in prayer

2324
01:47:30,688 --> 01:47:31,712
God has called you

2325
01:47:31,968 --> 01:47:33,760
He will support the finances for the school year

2326
01:47:34,272 --> 01:47:37,344
Also as a general rule do not offer payment plans

2327
01:47:47,328 --> 01:47:53,472
Also tuition is not

2328
01:47:55,776 --> 01:48:01,920
Tuition is not tax-deductible also if you're looking if you're looking for a fun car

2329
01:48:02,176 --> 01:48:05,760
College experience

2330
01:48:06,016 --> 01:48:11,904
You can get kicked out for swearing smoking or yep quotes non-refundable

2331
01:48:12,160 --> 01:48:16,512
Completely forbidden non-refundable not allowed to have a job while you're there

2332
01:48:16,768 --> 01:48:21,888
Quotes

2333
01:48:22,656 --> 01:48:26,496
Also also also big things to consider

2334
01:48:26,752 --> 01:48:32,896
Unless you're on Verizon you probably won't be able to contact the outside world because

2335
01:48:33,152 --> 01:48:35,712
Do not read

2336
01:48:35,968 --> 01:48:36,480
Yes

2337
01:48:36,736 --> 01:48:42,880
If there's a Verizon tower nearby so if you're on Verizon you probably be okay

2338
01:48:43,136 --> 01:48:44,928
But if you're on the other ones people have had

2339
01:48:45,184 --> 01:48:51,328
Problems getting a signal do not allow to print

2340
01:48:51,584 --> 01:48:57,728
Even customers to join this group

2341
01:48:57,984 --> 01:48:59,776
Being able to contact the outside world is this

2342
01:49:00,032 --> 01:49:02,592
Featuring not a buck

2343
01:49:03,104 --> 01:49:05,664
This is indoctrination

2344
01:49:05,920 --> 01:49:11,040
I was really really scared of it is really really really scared of it when I saw

2345
01:49:11,296 --> 01:49:12,064
Sure

2346
01:49:12,576 --> 01:49:13,088
Cuz I thought you was a

2347
01:49:13,856 --> 01:49:14,624
Yeah and knowing

2348
01:49:14,880 --> 01:49:18,208
Little different but it's still super f***** up

2349
01:49:19,488 --> 01:49:20,768
Is it the boys and girls that

2350
01:49:21,280 --> 01:49:23,328
I don't think separately

2351
01:49:23,584 --> 01:49:25,632
I already assumed

2352
01:49:25,888 --> 01:49:28,192
Now we find out what Lori's house

2353
01:49:28,704 --> 01:49:29,472
It's for housing music

2354
01:49:30,752 --> 01:49:32,032
It's not really about the abortion

2355
01:49:34,336 --> 01:49:36,896
Crisis pregnancy

2356
01:49:37,152 --> 01:49:39,712
Girls who code

2357
01:49:39,968 --> 01:49:40,480
So they don't end up

2358
01:49:40,736 --> 01:49:42,528
Open coed situation

2359
01:49:43,552 --> 01:49:46,368
Cuz if you f*** you figure out the God's not real bright

2360
01:49:46,624 --> 01:49:50,208
Black Square

2361
01:49:51,744 --> 01:49:56,864
Heirloom seeds

2362
01:49:57,632 --> 01:50:03,264
Investigation

2363
01:50:05,568 --> 01:50:11,712
For sure the Waters of

2364
01:50:11,968 --> 01:50:12,480
Now that we've come

2365
01:50:12,736 --> 01:50:15,296
To the company cuz I know why I did this

2366
01:50:15,808 --> 01:50:18,112
Yeah but I'm wondering what you're coming away with it

2367
01:50:20,160 --> 01:50:20,672
The same as

2368
01:50:20,928 --> 01:50:26,304
I intended that the sort of thing I am coming away with it with a

2369
01:50:26,560 --> 01:50:29,120
Newfound knowledge of my

2370
01:50:30,144 --> 01:50:31,936
F***** up upbringing and how it feels

2371
01:50:32,960 --> 01:50:34,752
But most importantly

2372
01:50:35,008 --> 01:50:36,288
I am

2373
01:50:36,544 --> 01:50:37,568
Thinking about how

2374
01:50:39,104 --> 01:50:41,664
Built-in like if we were to talk about Alec

2375
01:50:41,920 --> 01:50:42,432
In the present day

2376
01:50:43,456 --> 01:50:44,224
The thing that

2377
01:50:44,480 --> 01:50:44,992
Is getting

2378
01:50:45,248 --> 01:50:47,296
To me is that there's only one

2379
01:50:47,808 --> 01:50:48,320
Reaction

2380
01:50:49,856 --> 01:50:50,368
To turn it off

2381
01:50:50,624 --> 01:50:51,136
Exactly

2382
01:50:51,392 --> 01:50:52,160
It's just like

2383
01:50:52,416 --> 01:50:55,232
There's there's only one way to respond to that

2384
01:50:55,488 --> 01:50:56,768
You we can no longer

2385
01:50:57,024 --> 01:51:00,096
Like I'm not saying that we can never do a present-day Al except

2386
01:51:00,352 --> 01:51:04,704
Episode

2387
01:51:04,960 --> 01:51:06,752
To be not true or whatever but

2388
01:51:07,776 --> 01:51:09,056
I loved her right well that's

2389
01:51:09,312 --> 01:51:10,848
Not giving me many options up top

2390
01:51:11,360 --> 01:51:12,384
I love spicy

2391
01:51:12,896 --> 01:51:18,784
I love really spicy pepper sauce

2392
01:51:19,040 --> 01:51:20,320
What most people don't

2393
01:51:20,576 --> 01:51:23,904
Most people do not enjoy them and they find them intolerable switch

2394
01:51:25,184 --> 01:51:26,720
Alex Jones before

2395
01:51:26,976 --> 01:51:28,512
I find it tolerable most

2396
01:51:28,768 --> 01:51:32,096
People can't listen to it but I think there's some

2397
01:51:32,352 --> 01:51:33,120
Experiencing it

2398
01:51:33,376 --> 01:51:34,144
I can do it

2399
01:51:34,656 --> 01:51:36,192
I can tell you about what the sauce is like

2400
01:51:36,704 --> 01:51:39,008
And you can experience it on the second hand

2401
01:51:39,264 --> 01:51:42,848
Level and together we can make it entertaining

2402
01:51:43,872 --> 01:51:45,408
But there are other things

2403
01:51:45,664 --> 01:51:46,432
That are like

2404
01:51:46,944 --> 01:51:48,224
Their sauces that are gross

2405
01:51:48,736 --> 01:51:49,504
Are there two

2406
01:51:50,016 --> 01:51:54,624
6 million Scoville units or whatever

2407
01:51:55,136 --> 01:51:55,648
What's the f******

2408
01:51:55,904 --> 01:52:02,048
Point of this don't eat that right

2409
01:52:02,304 --> 01:52:08,448
Rubbing them around until you're blind in the present he is like putting Scotch bonnet up your butthole

2410
01:52:10,240 --> 01:52:13,824
There's no reason to engage with it at all

2411
01:52:14,080 --> 01:52:18,944
But now there's really the only response at this point is like

2412
01:52:19,200 --> 01:52:23,552
And thank God for the heroes who keep doing it but the only response to these people now is

2413
01:52:23,808 --> 01:52:24,832
Get the f*** out

2414
01:52:25,088 --> 01:52:30,208
If you're it's Sarah Huckabee Sanders is in your restaurant tell her to get the f*** out

2415
01:52:30,464 --> 01:52:33,536
If Alex is anywhere near you tell them to get the f*** out

2416
01:52:33,792 --> 01:52:35,072
Maybe we can talk later

2417
01:52:35,584 --> 01:52:38,656
After all this s*** is over but for now

2418
01:52:40,192 --> 01:52:40,704
Absolutely

2419
01:52:41,216 --> 01:52:43,520
Listen to this so now I'm back on the like

2420
01:52:44,544 --> 01:52:45,056
Let's

2421
01:52:45,312 --> 01:52:46,848
I have fun talking about con men

2422
01:52:47,104 --> 01:52:49,920
These people are evil

2423
01:52:50,176 --> 01:52:56,320
Jim Bakker is dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb but then there's also the

2424
01:52:56,576 --> 01:53:02,720
Do you like lust for money over power to not make it obvious

2425
01:53:02,976 --> 01:53:04,768
Trying to con you into buying potatoes

2426
01:53:05,024 --> 01:53:07,584
Because he doesn't mean to most of the time

2427
01:53:08,096 --> 01:53:10,912
It's a calculus that people do and I think Alex has done it with white

2428
01:53:13,216 --> 01:53:14,240
Jim Bakker doesn't

2429
01:53:14,496 --> 01:53:16,800
I'm sure they're not him but some employee

2430
01:53:17,056 --> 01:53:19,104
Alright

2431
01:53:19,360 --> 01:53:25,504
80% of the people who watch these are going to watch if you like

2432
01:53:25,760 --> 01:53:26,528
Percent of people

2433
01:53:26,784 --> 01:53:28,832
Maybe 5% of that 20%

2434
01:53:29,088 --> 01:53:30,880
Are going to end up buying stuff

2435
01:53:31,136 --> 01:53:32,672
So who cares if you make it over

2436
01:53:32,928 --> 01:53:33,952
If you make it over

2437
01:53:34,208 --> 01:53:40,352
You're not going to even if you're subtle about it you're not going to trick that 80% anyway

2438
01:53:40,608 --> 01:53:42,656
Focus on that 5% of the 20%

2439
01:53:43,680 --> 01:53:44,192
Except the 20

2440
01:53:44,448 --> 01:53:44,960
Percent

2441
01:53:45,216 --> 01:53:45,728
Does a hole

2442
01:53:47,776 --> 01:53:53,920
Text to 20% versus the community will only make the 5% more likely

2443
01:53:54,176 --> 01:53:55,968
Guilt about the other place

2444
01:53:56,224 --> 01:54:00,576
We need to keep this going for

2445
01:54:00,832 --> 01:54:02,112
Done that more with bigotry

2446
01:54:03,136 --> 01:54:03,648
Sales

2447
01:54:03,904 --> 01:54:04,928
Does any good sales are on

2448
01:54:05,696 --> 01:54:10,560
F****** much lower level than gyms

2449
01:54:13,632 --> 01:54:14,144
It's 8

2450
01:54:14,656 --> 01:54:16,192
Need to con people into doing the right thing

2451
01:54:16,448 --> 01:54:18,496
It's not it's somehow

2452
01:54:18,752 --> 01:54:20,032
Somehow they're trying though

2453
01:54:20,288 --> 01:54:22,336
To come people into not doing the right

2454
01:54:22,848 --> 01:54:24,640
That's a weird thing about the Democratic party right

2455
01:54:24,896 --> 01:54:26,432
Right now they're really trying hard

2456
01:54:26,944 --> 01:54:28,992
I'm actually in now I'm now I'm interest

2457
01:54:29,248 --> 01:54:30,016
Did you see how I

2458
01:54:30,272 --> 01:54:32,320
Or Taz did in the

2459
01:54:32,832 --> 01:54:35,136
Especially in the primary for the 14th

2460
01:54:35,648 --> 01:54:40,256
Church of New York

2461
01:54:41,024 --> 01:54:42,304
Well I'm glad

2462
01:54:42,560 --> 01:54:43,072
This was fun

2463
01:54:43,584 --> 01:54:44,096
This was fun

2464
01:54:44,352 --> 01:54:45,888
Jim Bakker is

2465
01:54:48,960 --> 01:54:49,728
My sort of radar

2466
01:54:49,984 --> 01:54:51,776
But there aren't as many people who have

2467
01:54:52,032 --> 01:54:52,544
I like

2468
01:54:53,056 --> 01:54:53,824
Frequent

2469
01:54:54,080 --> 01:54:54,592
Contact

2470
01:54:54,848 --> 01:55:00,992
Yeah you know like everyday to make without a couple things a week

2471
01:55:01,248 --> 01:55:02,272
People give

2472
01:55:05,088 --> 01:55:11,232
You got to give him that you got it

2473
01:55:11,488 --> 01:55:12,512
Big Mike cernovich does

2474
01:55:12,768 --> 01:55:14,304
Tons of stuff on Periscope and

2475
01:55:14,560 --> 01:55:17,632
I'm sure you can find those audio video streams

2476
01:55:17,888 --> 01:55:18,400
Go over

2477
01:55:18,656 --> 01:55:23,520
That doesn't seem as fun but if anybody out there if you have other ideas of people who might have overlooked

2478
01:55:25,056 --> 01:55:26,336
Send emails

2479
01:55:26,592 --> 01:55:27,104
Send a message to us

2480
01:55:28,384 --> 01:55:29,408

But for now I'm I'm excited

2482
01:55:32,480 --> 01:55:32,992
Talk

2483
01:55:34,272 --> 01:55:34,784
Yeah

2484
01:55:39,392 --> 01:55:40,160
Jim Bakker

2485
01:55:41,952 --> 01:55:42,464
Pathetic

2486
01:55:42,720 --> 01:55:44,256
It's just such money-grubbing

2487
01:55:44,768 --> 01:55:46,560
Crazy like there's nothing like it

2488
01:55:47,328 --> 01:55:47,840
That's what

2489
01:55:49,376 --> 01:55:51,680
Like that's what really fascinates me about the

2490
01:55:51,936 --> 01:55:53,216
Is Prosperity Gospel guys

2491
01:55:53,472 --> 01:55:53,984
Is envy

2492
01:55:54,496 --> 01:55:55,776
Please add Jim Bakker

2493
01:55:56,032 --> 01:55:56,544
Is the world

2494
01:55:56,800 --> 01:55:57,568
Where it's like

2495
01:55:58,592 --> 01:55:59,104
Wow

2496
01:55:59,616 --> 01:56:00,128
You have

2497
01:56:00,384 --> 01:56:00,896
Nothing

2498
01:56:01,408 --> 01:56:01,920
You believe

2499
01:56:02,176 --> 01:56:03,456
If you take

2500
01:56:03,968 --> 01:56:04,736
Religion

2501
01:56:05,248 --> 01:56:06,272
And you take the

2502
01:56:07,296 --> 01:56:10,112
Like ultimately kind-hearted believe that

2503
01:56:10,624 --> 01:56:11,392
Life is about

2504
01:56:11,648 --> 01:56:13,696
Being kind to others life is about

2505
01:56:15,488 --> 01:56:16,512
Serving AAA

2506
01:56:16,768 --> 01:56:17,792
Power that asked

2507
01:56:18,048 --> 01:56:20,096
Steel to do what's best

2508
01:56:20,864 --> 01:56:22,400
And you turn that into

2509
01:56:22,912 --> 01:56:24,192
I'm a billionaire

2510
01:56:27,520 --> 01:56:29,824
What and if you do that and then you commit

2511
01:56:30,080 --> 01:56:33,664
Massive fraud prison for 5 years

2512
01:56:33,920 --> 01:56:35,968
Write a book called I was wrong

2513
01:56:36,224 --> 01:56:39,552
About specifically how you got a lust for money

2514
01:56:39,808 --> 01:56:43,648
And that got you off track from the love of God

2515
01:56:47,488 --> 01:56:52,352
On a bigger scale it's like she's alright not to build Hotel

2516
01:56:52,608 --> 01:56:57,728
Fine you just have Cottages now Cottages in Condominiums

2517

She's the one who's behind.
