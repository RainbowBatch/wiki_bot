00:00:04,096 --> 00:00:10,240
Alexandra Thurston color

00:00:10,496 --> 00:00:16,640
Alex Jones Jordan

3
00:00:18,944 --> 00:00:25,088
I can't remember anything we ever coming in

4
00:00:25,344 --> 00:00:29,184
Mary on unfamiliar territory

5
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:34,816
Recording this on the in the morning cuz I'm flying out on vacation

6
00:00:38,144 --> 00:00:44,288
Window of the - 50 degrees Chicago

7
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:51,712
For a couple days

8
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:58,112
And because of that we have to record this ahead of time so we can get this episode out for Monday

9
00:00:58,368 --> 00:01:00,672
But we will not have an episode

10
00:01:00,928 --> 00:01:01,696
Just abide by virtue

11
00:01:02,208 --> 00:01:05,536
There's no way we could have pulled that off I wish I wish we could have

12
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:10,656
Yeah but that we could not appreciate everybody

13
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:17,056
Little man

14
00:01:17,312 --> 00:01:23,456
Call my parents kind of still at work

15
00:01:23,712 --> 00:01:24,480
Vacation

16
00:01:24,736 --> 00:01:28,832
Emotional word cookies

17
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:30,880
Very thrilled about that though because

18
00:01:31,136 --> 00:01:31,648
I mean

19
00:01:31,904 --> 00:01:32,672
This life

20
00:01:33,184 --> 00:01:34,464
Especially the show is Ben

21
00:01:35,232 --> 00:01:35,744
Nuts

22
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:36,768
Like in terms of

23
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,864
Monday

24
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:46,496
And then Alex's clear indications that he's f****** done with Rodger at the end

25
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:48,032
And even requiem

26
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:52,128
Talk too much about this but I was working on like a really big episode

27
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:54,688
Right before Rodger got indicted so it was like

28
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,480
3 straight days of

29
00:01:56,736 --> 00:01:59,040
Call Matt Rogers

30
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:01,600
This is got to go on the back burner and I got to dive into

31
00:02:02,112 --> 00:02:03,392
So I'm very excited

32
00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:07,232
To not do this for a couple days

33
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,888
I'll probably check Twitter but beyond that

34
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:17,728
I'm not doing anything

35
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:18,752
Working

36
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:24,128
The candle at both ends as it where I know a lot about Alex Jones

37
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:30,528
It doesn't matter today cannot talk about Alex Jones

38
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:38,976
Yeah last week no Wacky Wednesday last

39
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:46,144
Project

40
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,936

00:02:48,192 --> 00:02:49,216

Black

53
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,776
Jesus Christ

54
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:08,576
Not really Business website

55
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:10,368
Click the button for the show

56
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:18,303
So Jordan been

57
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:20,607
A little bit of a mess

58
00:04:21,119 --> 00:04:22,911
The sort of things that necessarily we liked

59
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:23,679
Recover

60
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:27,775
I don't need to hear Kerry Cassidy talk some weirdo by 5G technology

61
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:32,383
I really need to hear that I want to hear about space

62
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:36,735
I don't want to hear her talk about real science but

63
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:43,135
Libels pray that stuff there are, now.

64
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:49,535
Miss a little bit because I don't want to talk about her version of that

65
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:50,303
Delivered

66
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:56,703
Let interesting late spider leadership is involved with involved with 5G technology

67
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:57,727
How to get the f*** out of

68
00:04:57,983 --> 00:05:00,287
Start a punch on those little bit

69
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:03,871
I found it

70
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:04,895
With starring

71
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:07,199
Starex

72
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:12,831
He's on to promote his new book

73
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:17,439
Wow this is busy pretty good stuff this is interesting

74
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:19,231
Search talking about Luke

75
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:28,703
You talk about loose

76
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:30,239
Alright

77
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:32,799
He's talking about how he had these licked

78
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:38,431
These messages from Aliens

79
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:43,807
He starts talking about how he had some people who he had good help editing the book

80
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:45,855
I'm thinking

81
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:47,647
If you're getting messages from Aliens

82
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:50,207
You don't even understand

83
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:58,399
That's unfair that is unfair everybody

84
00:05:58,655 --> 00:06:01,215
True.

85
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:02,751
Worst

86
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:06,591
Grandma

87
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:10,943
Pretty similar

88
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:14,527
Certainly at least

89
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:18,111
Reliant

90
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:21,183
You can tell if there was a bigger story behind it

91
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:26,303
But they weren't talking about the specifics of okay

92
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:28,863
So I went back to a year prior

93
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:31,423
The first time Sebastian Martin was on the show

94
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:36,799
Wild okay sweets

95
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:39,103
I love Mia Sebastian

96
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:41,663
So I'm kind of on his side right off the write-up

97
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:48,063
Until the listeners that this is simultaneously the most fascinating and most boring story

98
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:56,255
I was a zigzag Road in yours backstory Tales of this are super interesting

99
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:58,047
But as I was going over it I

100
00:06:58,303 --> 00:07:01,631
Kept finding myself zoning out

101
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:07,007
God

102
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:07,775
I guess

103
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:09,311
I guess he's talking about the honor

104
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:10,335
Okay

105
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:11,103
Cool

106
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:16,479
I took slap myself in the face would be like getting the game's getting the game

107
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:21,855
So they'll be a little bit of that context drop

108
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:22,879
Today Show

109
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:26,207
It is a problem where people put at aliens

110
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:29,279
So-called aliens on pedestals so to speak

111
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:41,311
You don't got to elevate

112
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:51,807
Concerned

113
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:54,879
She's worried that we over exaggerate

114
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:56,927
The Evolve level

115
00:07:57,183 --> 00:08:01,791
Different different types

116
00:08:02,303 --> 00:08:04,607
Would you get that read between the lines however you like

117
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:08,703
On the show

118
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:13,823
It's interesting. They came out

119
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:15,359
Beginning of 2017

120
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:17,919
The two of them don't really know each other

121
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,479
They're on a little bit of

122
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:22,271
Oh and

123
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:23,551
He's a French dude

124
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:26,111
More fun

125
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:32,511
He hasn't is one of the types of people who gets tricked by an accent

126
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:39,167
It makes it makes dumb things sound smarter to American ears reading. European

127
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:43,007
Especially French or British

128
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:46,847
It's a hack it's like a little override

129
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:50,431
In people's brain be like

130
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:51,711
Yeah that's where the thing

131
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:54,271
Some of the stuff that you saying I would

132
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:56,831
I would beg the audience to imagine

133
00:08:57,087 --> 00:08:58,879
He wasn't French

134
00:08:59,135 --> 00:09:01,183
If they sound

135
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:02,463
Now

136
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:06,559
Carrie and Sebastian Matt alien conference

137
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:08,607
I think they call it the alien Congress

138
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:15,775
I don't think they have any kind of actual legislative power there's no balance

139
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:22,175
There's no alien executive or judicial

140
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:26,015
Here's how they start at the interview

141
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:32,159
Hi I'm Kerry Cassidy from Project Camelot

142
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:35,487
Today we are beautiful Congress and

143
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:39,839
Texas opportunity to meet up with Sebastian

144
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:43,167
Who is here as well attending the conference

145
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:49,567
He's a very interesting man he has been out and around telling his story a bit

146
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:53,151
But we're going to Dallas down a maybe a little deeper here

147
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:55,199
The great opportunity

148
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:58,527
Project Camelot 2

149
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:04,159
What's been going on with him over many many years and

150
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:09,279
I'm going to let him introduce himself since I actually don't know him that well

151
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:11,071
Heard a couple interviews

152
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:15,679
So I don't I don't know I feel like Gary knows nothing

153
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:18,751
Considering that you saying like what

154
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:24,895
He's been going people stories

155
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:26,687
Maybe skimmed in interview

156
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:27,711
Something like that

157
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:30,783
Are you can you can

158
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:31,807
Damn

159
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:34,111
We don't do this

160
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:34,879
Would you just

161
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:40,511
Are you prepared for the show yeah

162
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:43,839
I don't have a u.s. congress

163
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:47,423
To get ready to go to the vet

164
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:49,727
Really front-loaded or schedule preparing for

165
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:50,751
The Congress

166
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:53,311
Congress

167
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:55,359
Forgot

168
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:56,127
Prepare for the center

169
00:10:57,663 --> 00:10:58,431
She the

170
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:07,135
Introduce yourself I don't know who you are

171
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:11,999
So I was a C U of A

172
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:14,559
Multinational for 10 years in Canada

173
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:17,375
Struck my ears drain

174
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:20,447
First

175
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:24,287
He says he's a CEO of a multinational corporation

176
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:28,639
Or what you think he was

177
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:32,479
Immediately I'm like I don't believe anybody

178
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:40,671
I don't believe them across the board for the military

179
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:42,207
I can't figure that out

180
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:46,303
But if you're the CEO of a company that records should be somewhere

181
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:49,631
So

182
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:51,167
Hold on

183
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:54,495
However

184
00:11:56,543 --> 00:11:58,591
You could have a franchise of McDonald's

185
00:11:58,847 --> 00:12:00,383
In Canada and

186
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:08,831
Across the border in America and call yourself a multinational business

187
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:11,391
You going to start upright

188
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:12,927
Front office

189
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:14,463
Canada

190
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:18,047
Vizio remote

191
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:26,495
Across-the-board interviews I've watched Sebastian Martin as well as bio on Amazon in the blurb

192
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:30,079
Released book called journey and outer space

193
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:34,687
Martin consistently refers to himself as before Maceo of a multinational company

194
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:38,015
But in no instance does he ever say what that company was

195
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:39,551
Which I found very suspicious

196
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:43,647
If you just Google is named find a ton of Sebastian Martin's who aren't

197
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:45,183
Which doesn't get me anywhere

198
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:51,071
I decided to search

199
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:52,607
First Sebastian Martins

200
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:54,911
And see what came out

201
00:12:58,239 --> 00:13:02,591
Which mysteriously doesn't go

202
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:04,127
Of a multinational company

203
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:05,663
Jobs listed

204
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:08,479
What is its current business City run

205
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:10,271
Distribution

206
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:16,671
The website mostly about new-age pseudo-spiritual together lightworkers and what have you

207
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:21,279
That's what he's doing

208
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:24,863
What position is the director of focus herbs

209
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:32,543
Leader whose positions could be the CEO position he always stays as a part of History partially because the entire time

210
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:33,311
Have you was at fault

211
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:36,383
Another person

212
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:39,967
We drank any of this had a higher position in the company that he did

213
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:46,367
And beyond that the timeline doesn't work out

214
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:51,999
About

215
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:57,119
You look through the other lady has to find somebody who is like a little bit higher that's a little bit

216
00:13:57,375 --> 00:14:00,191
You're running a little bit higher

217
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:01,215
Thorough

218
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:03,519
Hireright

219
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:11,967
Another interview date in 2013 so neither

220
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:15,039
Of the two entries on his LinkedIn page could possibly represent

221
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:20,671
And that's just leave off of your resume on a job website

222
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:23,743
CEO of the multinational company

223
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:27,583
Please

224
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:31,167
It says it on a ton of interviews that he was in

225
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:39,103
Portion of LinkedIn

226
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:45,759
Mercury

227
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:51,647
Any honors and accolades article

228
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:57,791
About the 2012 responsibility

229
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:00,863
I don't know

230
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:07,263
But he says that his business got an honorable mention in the small slash medium business of any sector

231
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:08,031
Category

232
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:09,567
There it is

233
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:14,431
Sebastian was the CEO of a company called wet organic

234
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:19,551
Wedderspoon organic is a honey company

235
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:24,415
They sell small jars of Boutique honey for absurdly high prices

236
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:25,951
But that's not all

237
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:29,279
They also promote their honey is having antibacterial property

238
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:33,887
Interesting Lee that's not a problem honey absolutely does have antibacterial properties

239
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:35,167
But Weatherspoon is

240
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:38,239
Accused of exaggerating their honey powers on that front

241
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:42,079
In March 2015 they were hit with a class-action lawsuit for it

242
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:43,871
That's it would be voluntary

243
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:49,247
Voluntarily withdrawn in December but the exact details of why I got withdrawn

244
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:53,343
From looking at a series of court filings throughout fall 2015

245
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:57,439
It does appear that they reached some sort of out-of-court settlement but it's hard to say for sure

246
00:15:57,951 --> 00:16:01,023
So what are spoon Organics base product

247
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:03,071
For $50 you can get a honey-based

248
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:06,911
Or for $22 in get a smaller tube

249
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:14,335
Territory

250
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:18,175
For $21 you can buy a 5-pack of single-serving

251
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:24,575
Honey plus Vitality which were apparently perfect for when you're on-the-go I would rather put that on

252
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:28,415
Super male vitality

253
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:33,535
They sell versions that are honey plus immunity honey plus Clarity advertising minutes

254
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:35,327
Fuels the body and the mind

255
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:36,351
That sort of thing

256
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:43,007
So it looks like Sebastian ran a small to medium Boutique honey operation

257
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:46,591
Sound like it was a Fortune 500 company in order to elevated story

258
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:51,967
Moments like this that I'm glad that I got to the bottom of the story but also realize that it probably wasn't worth it

259
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:55,295
We could have just assumed it was something like this

260
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:09,631
He was just honest I wouldn't

261
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:14,495
But he's trying to make it seem like a business was much larger than it was

262
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,871
Everything

263
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:22,431
Simple everything I can tell like he started it

264
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:25,503
Department

265
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:31,903
Ended build-it small slash medium size

266
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:34,463
I am going to say it's slightly dishonest

267
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:36,511
To only represent

268
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:42,911
Mazzio's multinational corporations

269
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:43,679
What is 2

270
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:47,519
Elevate his story make himself seem way more important

271
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:51,615
So whatever you say is so much more important by virtue of that

272
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:56,991
But what stolen business Valor like that's kind of weird talking about here but it's the difference between

273
00:17:57,759 --> 00:18:00,063
You're being entirely made up and just exaggerated

274
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:03,391
It would be like someone just a rank

275
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:05,183
Can file enlisted person

276
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:09,535
And then they're saying that they were

277
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:11,583
Level up

278
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:14,911
Credit enough for being a CEO and not hate not being a lie

279
00:18:15,167 --> 00:18:15,679
But

280
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:19,007
I also think it's spiritually a little bit.

281
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:23,103
Both stood and honorable mention in the oven

282
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:27,455
The years were the years of 2012 was when you got that two honorable mention

283
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:34,111
And then 2015 was when I got the class-action

284
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:37,183
Where water

285
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:45,887
The company in 2013

286
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:47,423
On him

287
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:51,775
You know at least he wasn't around at the show the time

288
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:53,055
You do car to get the fence

289
00:18:54,847 --> 00:18:57,663
Marketing

290
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:00,479
The I don't know

291
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:06,623
Robin

292
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:10,719
Hey soon-to-be tsar2

293
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:11,999
No no no no no

294
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:15,583
That same sort of

295
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:17,631
Call Honey

296
00:19:19,423 --> 00:19:25,567
Doesn't honey business only thing that never goes bad or whatever it is

297
00:19:25,823 --> 00:19:27,359
Closing property

298
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:32,735
Let's move along

299
00:19:32,991 --> 00:19:37,599
Traduction

300
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:42,463
Pennsylvania

301
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:43,231
UK

302
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:45,023
Yu-Gi-Oh

303
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:46,303
And

304
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:47,839
In 2011

305
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:51,423
The dream

306
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:53,215
That's that was a common dream

307
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:55,519
The face of a boy

308
00:19:57,567 --> 00:19:59,103
You had eyes away before

309
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:02,943
Away from each other then house and

310
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:04,735
Cheekbones

311
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:10,367
And he was very happy

312
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:11,903
Key smiles

313
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:14,719
California

314
00:20:14,975 --> 00:20:15,743
UT novetta

315
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:23,167
Since I'm not that unusual because you not see him in

316
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:25,471
Does a woman

317
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:27,263
When I woke up in the morning

318
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:28,799
I went to work

319
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:31,871
That's a boy

320
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:32,895
The face

321
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:34,687
Was steel

322
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:35,455
In front of me

323
00:20:36,991 --> 00:20:38,783
And it was highly disturbing

324
00:20:39,551 --> 00:20:40,319
So you had a bad day

325
00:20:46,207 --> 00:20:46,719
Maybe have a

326
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:52,863
And then that face was staring at him all day I think you just meme in this case that

327
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:54,911
Couldn't get the image out of

328
00:20:56,191 --> 00:20:57,471
You imagine that

329
00:20:57,727 --> 00:20:59,519
You just had a face like directly in front of him like

330
00:21:00,031 --> 00:21:00,543
3 ft away

331
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:08,991
Best Buy

332
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:11,807
Thinking about this boy all day

333
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:13,599
Comes home

334
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:14,623
From work after having

335
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:16,928
Head all day

336
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,464
Starts to meditate

337
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,488
Or something

338
00:21:19,744 --> 00:21:21,536
It's not really clear what he's up to

339
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:24,608
And then the boy appears to him in his lips

340
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:28,448
My sofa

341
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:32,288
It does require

342
00:21:33,056 --> 00:21:34,848
And I put myself a cup of tea before hands

343
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,760
Not renewing what to expect

344
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:44,320
Basically

345
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:49,184
Something must have happened

346
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,720
I still get some

347
00:21:51,232 --> 00:21:53,792
With my eyes on second

348
00:21:55,328 --> 00:21:56,352
Ween the Walgreens

349
00:21:56,864 --> 00:21:58,400
Of energy around me

350
00:21:59,168 --> 00:21:59,680
I've been stopped

351
00:22:00,704 --> 00:22:01,728
And when I stopped

352
00:22:01,984 --> 00:22:02,496
Ibis

353
00:22:03,008 --> 00:22:03,776
Open

354
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:05,312
Andy was Beast

355
00:22:05,568 --> 00:22:06,080
Boy

356
00:22:06,336 --> 00:22:06,848
But stunning

357
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:07,872
In front of me

358
00:22:09,408 --> 00:22:10,432
He was about

359
00:22:10,688 --> 00:22:11,968
Speedway from me

360
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:14,784
How many was

361
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:15,552
Glowing

362
00:22:16,064 --> 00:22:18,624
Globe energy was breakfast with Buddy

363
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:19,392
Keith was not

364
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:28,608
Bouncy was

365
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,144
Physically there

366
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:32,704
The casino in Shreveport

367
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:36,544
So you got this boy in his room

368
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:42,176
Cereal

369
00:22:42,432 --> 00:22:44,480
Events at down on the couch

370
00:22:44,736 --> 00:22:46,016
Apparently

371
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:47,040
Spirit

372
00:22:47,296 --> 00:22:48,320
Just like a Frenchman

373
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:49,856
Azores

374
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:53,952
Call hours tonight

375

From France or is he

376
00:22:55,232 --> 00:22:59,584
The Bordeaux

377
00:23:00,096 --> 00:23:00,864
Empire

378
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,400
Is it legit Frenchman

379
00:23:02,656 --> 00:23:04,448
But yeah used

380
00:23:04,704 --> 00:23:08,032
Spend some time in Germany of UK and Canada also throughout his

381
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:17,760
It's before he went to the different countries

382
00:23:18,016 --> 00:23:19,552
And it's very disappointing

383
00:23:19,808 --> 00:23:20,320
Nope

384
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,672
You sitting there this boy comes and visit

385
00:23:26,976 --> 00:23:27,744
But it turns out

386
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:28,512
The boy

387
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:32,096
Am I try to get up

388
00:23:33,632 --> 00:23:34,912
I was frozen

389
00:23:38,496 --> 00:23:40,288
Because it was going to stop by the whole thing

390
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:45,152
When I so Hammond

391
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:46,432
You must have heard me

392
00:23:50,272 --> 00:23:52,320
Basically responded saying

393
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:53,856
My Name Is Earl

394
00:23:54,368 --> 00:23:56,160
The oar

395
00:23:56,416 --> 00:23:58,208
And I'm from the Galactic Federation

396
00:23:58,976 --> 00:24:00,768
She said no I forgot

397
00:24:01,792 --> 00:24:03,328
Refrigeration

398
00:24:03,584 --> 00:24:05,120
But I'm guessing

399
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:11,008
We had a 15-minute phone conversation

400
00:24:11,264 --> 00:24:13,056
Which is

401
00:24:13,568 --> 00:24:17,920
Intractable

402
00:24:18,432 --> 00:24:19,712
Weird space

403
00:24:21,248 --> 00:24:25,600
I was a little bit turned on at the same time cuz I'm kind of

404
00:24:25,856 --> 00:24:28,160
Had some

405
00:24:28,416 --> 00:24:28,928
Sleep paralysis

406
00:24:30,464 --> 00:24:30,976
Described

407
00:24:32,768 --> 00:24:33,280
Paralysis

408
00:24:34,304 --> 00:24:39,424
Talk about is very

409
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:41,472
Justfly contact

410
00:24:41,728 --> 00:24:44,288
But I do like the idea that

411
00:24:45,056 --> 00:24:48,640
1550 minute conversation

412
00:24:50,432 --> 00:24:53,760
Azure

413
00:24:58,368 --> 00:25:02,208
My favorite thing

414
00:25:02,464 --> 00:25:02,976
Just like

415
00:25:04,512 --> 00:25:06,816
Galactic Federation

416
00:25:08,864 --> 00:25:09,376
Russian Federation

417
00:25:09,632 --> 00:25:10,144
Carrie's just like

418
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:16,544
Bright corn dad also

419
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:21,920
In fact if you Google's or Intergalactic Alliance or whatever or Federation

420
00:25:23,968 --> 00:25:26,016
Keeps popping outfits

421
00:25:26,272 --> 00:25:32,416
But there's another podcast

422
00:25:32,672 --> 00:25:36,000
And on the same episode

423
00:25:36,256 --> 00:25:39,584
I don't think they're on it together

424
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:45,728
I don't think they're on the episode together I think it's like this guy interview both of them

425
00:25:45,984 --> 00:25:48,800
But just to show there's a connection

426
00:25:49,568 --> 00:25:51,104
Some podcast will have both

427
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:53,152
Jon rappoport

428
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,200
Zoar alien on

429
00:25:55,456 --> 00:25:59,552
Cuz this is what I see happening right now

430
00:26:04,672 --> 00:26:05,184
3-space

431
00:26:05,696 --> 00:26:06,208
Zoar

432
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:06,976
Sebastian

433
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:07,744
Sebastian

434
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:16,704
CEO of yourself honey

435
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,752
Ends or those oars always like

436
00:26:19,008 --> 00:26:20,544
I'm way up in the clock

437
00:26:21,824 --> 00:26:25,152
And then they both kind of learn about each other and eventually they find out

438
00:26:25,408 --> 00:26:26,432
You know

439
00:26:26,688 --> 00:26:28,224
Glee Sebastian has to be like

440
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:30,528
Man I've been lying to

441
00:26:30,784 --> 00:26:33,088
See this whole time

442
00:26:33,344 --> 00:26:33,856
Dude

443
00:26:34,624 --> 00:26:40,768
I'm a janitor

444
00:26:41,024 --> 00:26:43,840
But also I love honey

445
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:47,424
Realized I got to clean my apartment

446
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:48,192
Let's trade

447
00:26:48,704 --> 00:26:54,848
As if you was talking I did it again find myself zoning out a little bit what I realized I could

448
00:26:55,104 --> 00:26:56,896
Myself is CEO of an international

449
00:26:57,408 --> 00:26:57,920
That's true

450
00:26:59,968 --> 00:27:01,248
Maybe that's not fair

451
00:27:03,552 --> 00:27:06,624
How about that

452
00:27:10,464 --> 00:27:15,072
What are the problems with Carrie and a lot of her guests

453
00:27:18,656 --> 00:27:19,680
What's the problem

454
00:27:21,472 --> 00:27:22,240
Is that they talk

455
00:27:22,496 --> 00:27:26,336
Well because they don't keep it in line

456
00:27:26,848 --> 00:27:30,432
Start trying to develop these stories for themselves

457
00:27:33,248 --> 00:27:36,064
Describe their backstory

458
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,344
You start to get these

459
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,880
About like

460
00:27:39,136 --> 00:27:40,672
You're describing is

461
00:27:40,928 --> 00:27:42,464
Is not aliens

462
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:44,000
What you're describing isn't

463
00:27:44,256 --> 00:27:45,280
Like you didn't

464
00:27:47,072 --> 00:27:49,120
Goal of whatever

465
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:50,656
Isn't what you want

466
00:27:51,936 --> 00:27:52,448
It's good enough

467
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:53,728
The trick people

468
00:27:54,752 --> 00:27:56,032
Physics Cliff was my first

469
00:27:56,288 --> 00:27:57,312
Signs like a real wrestler

470
00:27:58,336 --> 00:28:00,640
McDonald's had a farm houses

471
00:28:02,176 --> 00:28:02,944
I need was wanted

472
00:28:03,456 --> 00:28:04,736
And I had to

473
00:28:04,992 --> 00:28:05,760
Recurring nightmares

474
00:28:07,552 --> 00:28:08,320
As a child

475
00:28:08,576 --> 00:28:13,952
But I saw that ghost going in Georgia

476
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:21,120
Goat

477
00:28:21,376 --> 00:28:22,912
It kind of makes sense to me

478
00:28:23,424 --> 00:28:24,448
Understood

479
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,520
Genuine

480
00:28:28,032 --> 00:28:29,056
Understanding of

481
00:28:29,312 --> 00:28:30,336
Just to know what they were

482
00:28:30,592 --> 00:28:31,616
In Sons of Anarchy

483
00:28:35,456 --> 00:28:39,040
Human being who passed away like we see their bodies floating around

484
00:28:39,296 --> 00:28:42,368
And that's was

485
00:28:44,416 --> 00:28:49,280
Videoeta is parents

486
00:28:49,792 --> 00:28:52,352
Recurring nightmares

487
00:28:52,608 --> 00:28:53,120
About

488
00:28:53,376 --> 00:28:56,704
Consciousness a little bit

489
00:28:57,984 --> 00:28:59,008
Selfie was seeing ghosts

490
00:29:02,336 --> 00:29:04,384
I live in Hawaii for a little bit grown up

491
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:07,200
And when I lived there I we lived in this house

492
00:29:08,224 --> 00:29:09,248
We came to find out what's hot

493
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,040
For allegedly haunted

494
00:29:13,344 --> 00:29:14,368
The Kasha of Kaimuki

495
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:15,904
Which is like a

496
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:18,720
Vengeful Spirit apparently

497
00:29:18,976 --> 00:29:20,256
Lived in this house

498
00:29:20,512 --> 00:29:21,280
We lived in

499
00:29:21,536 --> 00:29:23,584
He's one of those things that we didn't have money

500
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:27,424
@properties pretty expensive

501
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:32,032
In Hawaii

502
00:29:32,288 --> 00:29:34,336
For a while cuz no one wanted to move

503
00:29:34,592 --> 00:29:35,360
Cuz local

504
00:29:39,456 --> 00:29:42,016
All this s***

505
00:29:42,272 --> 00:29:42,784
Fiza

506
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:49,184
These old women that are out every now and again

507
00:29:52,768 --> 00:29:54,816
I think I like I have a memory of

508
00:29:55,072 --> 00:29:56,352
Thinking I saw a ghost

509
00:29:56,864 --> 00:29:59,936
Like I was laying in bed one night

510
00:30:00,192 --> 00:30:01,216
I saw it

511
00:30:01,472 --> 00:30:03,520
In my closet with a

512
00:30:03,776 --> 00:30:04,800
The Flaming Act

513
00:30:08,128 --> 00:30:10,432
Right then I could do the same story that he's doing

514
00:30:10,688 --> 00:30:13,248
I could use that as I can say

515
00:30:13,504 --> 00:30:14,784
I was under the age

516
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:15,552
Japan

517
00:30:15,808 --> 00:30:18,368
There were things I couldn't understand

518
00:30:18,624 --> 00:30:24,768
Like these women throwing salt at our house good at explaining these thing

519
00:30:25,024 --> 00:30:25,792
Tried to comfort

520
00:30:26,048 --> 00:30:30,400
Me about the idea that these people think our house is haunted or whatever but

521
00:30:31,168 --> 00:30:32,704
They weren't they were the best

522
00:30:33,472 --> 00:30:39,616
Conflict resolution in that in that way you got it in my head like oh I communicate

523
00:30:42,176 --> 00:30:42,944
Real

524
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:43,712
Vegas X

525
00:30:43,968 --> 00:30:50,112
Didn't integrate the information I was having

526
00:30:50,368 --> 00:30:51,648
Beto's probably playing

527
00:30:51,904 --> 00:30:58,048
Computer game back then that had something

528
00:31:00,352 --> 00:31:06,496
I think I might have at a friend's house

529
00:31:06,752 --> 00:31:07,776
No

530
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:09,056
Definitely not

531
00:31:09,312 --> 00:31:12,896
Whatever the rational explanation

532
00:31:14,944 --> 00:31:15,712
The circumstances

533
00:31:15,968 --> 00:31:18,784
Like there's a path you can take the stupid

534
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:19,552
You can take that

535
00:31:20,064 --> 00:31:21,600
Is more real

536
00:31:21,856 --> 00:31:22,368
The path here

537
00:31:22,624 --> 00:31:23,392
And it's unfortunate

538
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:24,416
Because it is

539
00:31:24,672 --> 00:31:25,184
Like

540
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:25,952
You know

541
00:31:26,208 --> 00:31:27,488
Is kid that played by Nightmare

542
00:31:27,744 --> 00:31:29,536
It's unfortunate that

543
00:31:29,792 --> 00:31:30,816
He's allowing these fans

544
00:31:33,632 --> 00:31:34,400
In such a serious

545
00:31:35,424 --> 00:31:38,240
I like the idea

546
00:31:39,776 --> 00:31:40,800
House hunting show

547
00:31:41,056 --> 00:31:41,568
On HD

548
00:31:42,848 --> 00:31:44,128
That is just for like

549
00:31:44,384 --> 00:31:45,664
Really discounted houses

550
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:46,688
Because they were haunted

551
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,504
That would be a really fast

552
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:52,576
From what I understand I don't know

553
00:31:52,832 --> 00:31:54,112
McKay's but like

554
00:31:54,624 --> 00:31:55,648
From what I understand

555
00:31:55,904 --> 00:31:56,928
After we moved out

556
00:31:57,184 --> 00:31:57,952
Move to Missouri

557
00:31:58,976 --> 00:32:00,768
That the house was again

558
00:32:01,024 --> 00:32:01,792
No one moved in

559
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:04,864
They just couldn't get anyone to

560
00:32:06,912 --> 00:32:07,936
Look the point is

561
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:09,984
We all choose our path

562
00:32:13,312 --> 00:32:15,360
Will get back to

563
00:32:17,152 --> 00:32:20,224
I told you move around

564
00:32:22,272 --> 00:32:23,040
And you were suspecting

565
00:32:24,576 --> 00:32:26,368
Or something like that

566
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:29,440
It's not he's running towards

567
00:32:30,976 --> 00:32:32,256
Germany

568
00:32:32,768 --> 00:32:33,280
Curiosity

569
00:32:33,536 --> 00:32:34,560
Had a girlfriend

570
00:32:35,072 --> 00:32:37,888
I just move there

571
00:32:38,144 --> 00:32:39,168
Josey Jewell

572
00:32:41,216 --> 00:32:42,752
But you still wearing the French service

573
00:32:45,056 --> 00:32:47,360
So did you have a long time there are just you just

574
00:32:53,248 --> 00:32:55,296
I broke my arm at the end

575
00:32:55,552 --> 00:32:57,088
Weeks before the end of my service

576
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:00,160
Because what happened

577
00:33:01,184 --> 00:33:03,744
And I broke my arm doing

578
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,792
Training and I went back to France

579
00:33:06,304 --> 00:33:07,584
And that's what I meant

580
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:09,120
3 days later

581
00:33:09,376 --> 00:33:09,888
So

582
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:14,240
Pretty much what happened tonight get back to Germany and broke my contract when I move to England

583
00:33:15,776 --> 00:33:18,080
So within like 11 months

584
00:33:18,336 --> 00:33:22,688
He moved to Germany for a woman breaks his arm woman

585
00:33:22,944 --> 00:33:24,992
In France that moves to England for

586
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:28,320
That's not a stable person

587
00:33:28,576 --> 00:33:31,648
That's it that's is really

588
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,696
Like questionable Behavior

589
00:33:33,952 --> 00:33:40,096
I understand moving for like a tiny bow

590
00:33:42,912 --> 00:33:44,192
But like if

591
00:33:44,448 --> 00:33:46,496
If you have nothing tying you down necessarily

592
00:33:49,056 --> 00:33:50,080
You care about it somewhere else

593
00:33:50,592 --> 00:33:53,664
Why not why not try and like start Eliza If it's

594
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:55,456
If it's all appropriate

595
00:33:56,992 --> 00:33:58,272
Is a little bit much

596
00:34:02,112 --> 00:34:03,648
It's not only that you have no ties

597
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:07,232
Geographical location you started and you have no ties

598
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:11,072
You are just

599
00:34:11,328 --> 00:34:13,376
Leaf in the wind we can blown around

600
00:34:13,632 --> 00:34:18,496
I broke my arm

601
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:27,968
Seems like he's fulfilling all of our stereotypes about French people

602
00:34:36,672 --> 00:34:40,768
The sound slightly more than because of an accident

603
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,816
So are we get back now

604
00:34:44,352 --> 00:34:44,864
Is useful

605
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:46,912
Paranormal

606
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:48,192
I guess activity

607
00:34:48,448 --> 00:34:51,008
Heard there was a haunted show

608
00:34:51,264 --> 00:34:51,776
You can talk to ghosts

609
00:34:52,288 --> 00:34:54,336
But he was also having visions back then

610
00:34:55,616 --> 00:34:56,128
When he was younger

611
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:57,152
And

612
00:34:57,408 --> 00:35:00,224
I think the timeline of these Visions is interesting

613
00:35:06,112 --> 00:35:07,136
Cuz you saw the ghost

614
00:35:08,672 --> 00:35:09,952
Approximately

615
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:11,744
Play Robin 12 years old

616
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,560
Okay

617
00:35:15,584 --> 00:35:16,096
Priest

618
00:35:16,352 --> 00:35:16,864
Stingrays

619
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:17,888
Until the age of

620
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:20,960
And after that

621
00:35:25,312 --> 00:35:27,360
Because I blocked it off button

622
00:35:28,128 --> 00:35:30,176
So the first thing they're at the end is

623
00:35:30,432 --> 00:35:32,480
Yeah there's a voluntary aspect

624
00:35:32,992 --> 00:35:34,784
Barro's Pizza block

625
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,832
Vision

626
00:35:37,088 --> 00:35:40,672
He has a lot of mental fortitude

627
00:35:41,184 --> 00:35:42,208
Next B2

628
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:45,792
When I got here

629
00:35:46,048 --> 00:35:47,584
It's from 12 to 16

630
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:53,984
It was terrible and uncontrollable subsided I hear that this might be a hormone

631
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:57,824
Photo issue

632
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:02,176
Has ever had interesting emotional

633
00:36:02,432 --> 00:36:04,736
Issues

634
00:36:05,248 --> 00:36:06,784
I think it's very common

635
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:09,856
You have a pubescent crisis a little bit

636
00:36:11,136 --> 00:36:12,672
Changing hormonal levels

637
00:36:14,208 --> 00:36:15,744
That accompanies that there

638
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,048
It's very simple to look at this and be like

639
00:36:18,816 --> 00:36:24,448
I would say based on that timeline the fact that they magically subsided around 16

640
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,240
Akai here I just

641
00:36:26,752 --> 00:36:27,264
This is

642
00:36:27,776 --> 00:36:28,800
A product of

643
00:36:29,824 --> 00:36:30,336
Miss

644
00:36:30,592 --> 00:36:32,384
Integrated information

645
00:36:34,944 --> 00:36:37,248
These traumatizing nightmares that you had as a child

646
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:38,528
Evan the hormonal

647
00:36:38,784 --> 00:36:40,576
Shift

648
00:36:40,832 --> 00:36:41,600
So so far

649
00:36:41,856 --> 00:36:42,368
I hear

650
00:36:43,392 --> 00:36:48,512
Believe Israel

651
00:36:48,768 --> 00:36:49,280
Andale

652
00:36:50,048 --> 00:36:51,072
Because now I have to ask

653
00:36:51,328 --> 00:36:51,840
The question

654
00:36:52,352 --> 00:36:56,960
Do ghosts are there aliens

655
00:36:57,472 --> 00:37:02,848
Ostensibly if aliens have treated Earth is a Battleground many aliens have died on Earth

656
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,712
A+ someone on Project

657
00:37:11,296 --> 00:37:17,440
Episodes I don't know

658
00:37:19,488 --> 00:37:20,512
We can start controlling them

659
00:37:23,584 --> 00:37:26,912
He was able to block them off for 10 years but they do come back

660
00:37:27,424 --> 00:37:28,192
Even

661
00:37:28,448 --> 00:37:31,008
Further solidifies in my mind that this is stress related

662
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:32,288
Because here

663
00:37:32,544 --> 00:37:33,312
Is when they came back

664
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:35,104
Becky's my wife

665
00:37:35,616 --> 00:37:36,384
The pregnant

666
00:37:40,224 --> 00:37:44,064
For ten years while being married with a block my vision

667
00:37:44,576 --> 00:37:45,088
Because

668
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:46,624
I2

669
00:37:47,392 --> 00:37:48,160
I respect your wishes

670
00:37:48,416 --> 00:37:48,928
Baseball nut

671
00:37:51,488 --> 00:37:53,280
Being frightened by what was happening this

672
00:37:53,792 --> 00:37:54,816
The sidon

673
00:37:55,584 --> 00:37:57,632
Mac

674
00:37:59,168 --> 00:37:59,936
DC Pride

675
00:38:00,192 --> 00:38:00,704
Do something

676
00:38:01,216 --> 00:38:03,008
Soul by respective Hudson

677
00:38:03,264 --> 00:38:04,800
My Visions off

678
00:38:05,312 --> 00:38:05,824
What's the news

679
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:06,592
And

680
00:38:07,616 --> 00:38:10,432
When she became pregnant maybe just came back in.

681
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:11,968
Used to have XP

682
00:38:14,272 --> 00:38:17,600
And it was very disturbing because I was not really used to

683
00:38:18,624 --> 00:38:19,648
After 10 years was

684
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:21,184
Green Adidas

685
00:38:22,464 --> 00:38:24,512
I was re-reading the employees you know

686
00:38:25,024 --> 00:38:26,816
Had no clue what was going on

687
00:38:27,328 --> 00:38:33,472
So he has this honey business that's been growing and he's going to on the cusp of getting dishonorable mention award tickets

688
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:39,360
No it's a real business that you like even if it isn't as big as he's

689
00:38:39,616 --> 00:38:42,176
It's still a lot of pressure you still haven't

690
00:38:42,432 --> 00:38:44,736
Are responsible for getting the damn hunting out

691
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:48,064
You got to go to school.

692
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:51,648
A lot of work

693
00:38:51,904 --> 00:38:52,928
Gets pregnant which is a

694
00:38:53,184 --> 00:38:55,232
Life-changing experience

695
00:38:55,744 --> 00:39:00,864
The people there's a real blow Hardy thing that I've had a couple friends that kids sale

696
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:04,704
Everything Changes

697
00:39:09,312 --> 00:39:15,456
Don't think that it's not sincere or real-life fear that is your response

698
00:39:15,712 --> 00:39:17,504
Ability

699
00:39:21,088 --> 00:39:21,856
To have to

700
00:39:22,112 --> 00:39:22,624
Wrestle with

701
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:23,648
Out of nowhere

702
00:39:23,904 --> 00:39:25,696
Because of the news or whatever of it

703
00:39:26,976 --> 00:39:28,256
Almost always is like

704
00:39:30,048 --> 00:39:30,816
They weren't pregnant

705
00:39:33,632 --> 00:39:34,656
Pivotal shift

706
00:39:34,912 --> 00:39:36,448
It causes a lot of stress in people

707
00:39:36,704 --> 00:39:38,496
So if you have a story where from

708
00:39:38,752 --> 00:39:39,776
From 12 to 16

709
00:39:40,032 --> 00:39:42,336
The time when your hormones are out of whack and

710
00:39:42,592 --> 00:39:44,640
Highly stressful.

711
00:39:44,896 --> 00:39:45,920
You have all these visions

712
00:39:46,432 --> 00:39:47,968
After that they subside

713
00:39:48,224 --> 00:39:48,992
You block them

714
00:39:49,248 --> 00:39:50,784
Once you get married entirely

715
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:52,320
You know all this time

716
00:39:52,576 --> 00:39:55,648
Then a new highly stressful life change happens

717
00:39:55,904 --> 00:39:57,440
And all of a sudden they come back

718
00:39:57,696 --> 00:39:58,976
I'm seeing a pattern

719
00:39:59,232 --> 00:39:59,744
I don't understand

720
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,792
I know

721
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:05,632
I'm just saying

722
00:40:06,656 --> 00:40:07,936
He has these vision

723
00:40:08,192 --> 00:40:08,960
Then that coincides

724
00:40:10,752 --> 00:40:13,312
And then after his brain is fully formed right around

725
00:40:13,568 --> 00:40:14,080
11:35

726
00:40:14,336 --> 00:40:14,848
27

727
00:40:15,104 --> 00:40:15,872
He settles down

728
00:40:16,384 --> 00:40:16,896
He gets married

729
00:40:17,408 --> 00:40:19,200
Doesn't really have that much

730
00:40:20,992 --> 00:40:22,272
And then he has a

731
00:40:22,528 --> 00:40:23,296
The big life change

732
00:40:23,808 --> 00:40:26,368
Reasserting the same hormonal

733
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:28,416
But he's had before and all of a sudden

734
00:40:28,672 --> 00:40:29,696
Are you going back to having visions

735
00:40:30,208 --> 00:40:32,768
Ulta

736
00:40:33,024 --> 00:40:33,536
Dan

737
00:40:34,048 --> 00:40:34,816
Alien ghost

738
00:40:35,584 --> 00:40:37,120
Goodnight they're following him around

739
00:40:37,376 --> 00:40:38,144
There's a possibility

740
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,424
So

741
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:40,192
You know

742
00:40:40,448 --> 00:40:40,960
I have

743
00:40:46,592 --> 00:40:48,640
Could be pruned

744
00:40:48,896 --> 00:40:50,688
So as a child

745
00:40:50,944 --> 00:40:52,992
Carrie wants to get into

746
00:40:53,248 --> 00:40:53,760
Whereabouts

747
00:40:54,016 --> 00:40:56,832
And conveniently inconsequential

748
00:40:57,088 --> 00:40:58,624
And only related to

749
00:40:59,136 --> 00:41:00,416
As a child

750
00:41:00,672 --> 00:41:03,232
There's no way we could verify anything

751
00:41:04,256 --> 00:41:05,280
So that's super convenia

752
00:41:06,048 --> 00:41:11,424
Go back to when you were in a 12-hour. Agent and a little later

753
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:15,008
Okay, said between 12 and 16 you're having visions right

754
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:16,288
So how were the vision

755
00:41:16,544 --> 00:41:17,824
Characterize at that time

756
00:41:19,104 --> 00:41:20,128
About them

757
00:41:20,384 --> 00:41:23,200
Premonitions

758
00:41:23,456 --> 00:41:29,088
Future events

759
00:41:36,256 --> 00:41:42,144
So would you know something before it happened in the morning

760
00:41:42,912 --> 00:41:44,960
Oh yes

761
00:41:45,216 --> 00:41:46,496
People around here perhaps

762
00:41:48,544 --> 00:41:50,592
Call vibrate

763
00:41:51,104 --> 00:41:53,919
And he became part of my life

764
00:41:59,295 --> 00:42:00,063
I was adamant

765
00:42:00,575 --> 00:42:02,879
To even talk about the infraction hadn't

766
00:42:03,135 --> 00:42:03,647
Resort

767
00:42:03,903 --> 00:42:05,439
Because she doesn't

768
00:42:06,207 --> 00:42:06,975
So

769
00:42:07,487 --> 00:42:10,559
None of us can really be tracked back

770
00:42:11,071 --> 00:42:12,095
Meaningful way you know like

771
00:42:12,607 --> 00:42:15,679
Premonition

772
00:42:15,935 --> 00:42:20,031
Pete was going to playground

773
00:42:20,543 --> 00:42:21,055
Alright whatever

774
00:42:21,567 --> 00:42:23,103
Maybe a hunch

775
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:29,503
Maybe a hunch Steve has been acting recklessly for a while

776
00:42:30,527 --> 00:42:33,087
Right right ultimate

777
00:42:33,343 --> 00:42:37,183
Inconsequential

778
00:42:37,439 --> 00:42:41,023
So I don't know

779
00:42:41,279 --> 00:42:42,047
He does say

780
00:42:42,303 --> 00:42:44,863
They didn't want to tell his mom about Zoar

781
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:46,143
Because you don't believe in aliens

782
00:42:49,983 --> 00:42:51,519
Completely rationalist family

783
00:42:51,775 --> 00:42:53,311
And no date

784
00:42:55,871 --> 00:42:56,383
This nonsense

785
00:42:58,431 --> 00:42:59,711
She doesn't

786
00:42:59,967 --> 00:43:00,735
He believed himself

787
00:43:02,271 --> 00:43:02,783
So

788
00:43:03,295 --> 00:43:04,575
I think another

789
00:43:04,831 --> 00:43:05,599
Essential elements

790
00:43:05,855 --> 00:43:06,623
These sorts of things

791
00:43:08,415 --> 00:43:09,183
To really latch on

792
00:43:10,207 --> 00:43:11,487
Especially in childhood

793
00:43:11,743 --> 00:43:13,279
Important you have a source

794
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:15,583
But you have to have some

795
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:19,935
I keep my parents have believed in ghosts or something like that

796
00:43:21,983 --> 00:43:22,495
Just wanted to

797
00:43:23,007 --> 00:43:24,799
Because at that time I would have

798
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:26,847
Relied on this Authority

799
00:43:27,103 --> 00:43:27,871
Figure in my parents

800
00:43:28,383 --> 00:43:30,175
I'm very believe that this is real

801
00:43:30,431 --> 00:43:31,455
Why should I not believe

802
00:43:32,479 --> 00:43:34,015
So I need to find a

803
00:43:34,271 --> 00:43:34,783
Peace

804
00:43:35,039 --> 00:43:35,551
From Sebastian

805
00:43:35,807 --> 00:43:36,575
Martin's life

806
00:43:37,855 --> 00:43:38,879
Concrete enough

807
00:43:39,391 --> 00:43:40,927
Fit me

808
00:43:41,183 --> 00:43:42,463
That there's

809
00:43:43,231 --> 00:43:45,023
Let me tell you there's more than one

810
00:43:45,279 --> 00:43:49,375
Oh boy is Mexico if he talks about his grandma

811
00:43:49,631 --> 00:43:52,447
My Grandma had a vision of the Virgin Mary

812
00:43:52,959 --> 00:43:54,239
So what about

813
00:43:55,519 --> 00:43:56,543
Grandparents

814
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:00,127
Have a grandparent ever or other

815
00:44:02,943 --> 00:44:06,527
Cher

816
00:44:06,783 --> 00:44:08,575
Decide

817
00:44:09,855 --> 00:44:10,623
Was

818
00:44:10,879 --> 00:44:11,647
She had cancer

819
00:44:12,159 --> 00:44:12,927
It made many places

820
00:44:13,439 --> 00:44:17,023
He was one of the miracle of Lourdes in

821
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:21,631
She said she'd be why some

822
00:44:21,887 --> 00:44:23,167
The Redskins least on the

823
00:44:23,423 --> 00:44:24,703
Real miracles

824
00:44:25,471 --> 00:44:29,567
Miracle

825
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:31,359
Driven in a wheelchair

826
00:44:31,615 --> 00:44:32,383
The Grotto

827
00:44:34,175 --> 00:44:36,479
This was back when have one area

828
00:44:39,039 --> 00:44:40,063
Catholic after that

829
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:41,343
She was protesting

830
00:44:42,367 --> 00:44:44,671
And how old was she

831
00:44:44,927 --> 00:44:45,439
Timer

832
00:44:45,695 --> 00:44:46,975
Popping a 30

833
00:44:50,047 --> 00:44:52,095
Today

834
00:44:52,351 --> 00:44:53,375
Yes

835
00:44:53,887 --> 00:44:57,471
She's very genuine and

836
00:44:59,263 --> 00:45:01,055
I'm still in touch with her but

837
00:45:01,311 --> 00:45:02,335
He had these

838
00:45:02,591 --> 00:45:03,359
Found expensive

839
00:45:05,663 --> 00:45:06,175
And

840
00:45:07,455 --> 00:45:08,991
Again just related to religion

841
00:45:09,503 --> 00:45:11,295
And I wasn't a religious person so

842
00:45:12,063 --> 00:45:12,831
Cannabis card

843
00:45:13,087 --> 00:45:14,111
Has being relevant

844
00:45:14,623 --> 00:45:17,951
In any way

845
00:45:19,487 --> 00:45:20,511
Eastside other stories

846
00:45:20,767 --> 00:45:22,047
Here

847
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:28,703
The stories about your grandmother or did you run mother tell you

848
00:45:29,215 --> 00:45:29,727
I don't believe that

849
00:45:31,007 --> 00:45:33,055
You can say that he only heard those stories later I don't

850
00:45:33,567 --> 00:45:37,407
If you have sold

851
00:45:37,663 --> 00:45:41,247
The Virgin Mary at The Grotto in the Vatican

852
00:45:41,503 --> 00:45:47,647
Becomes a Catholic out of nowhere before that's going to be a piece of your

853
00:45:47,903 --> 00:45:48,671
Family lore

854
00:45:48,927 --> 00:45:54,559
That's not something there's a good

855
00:45:54,815 --> 00:45:57,119
It's going to be it's going to be something

856
00:45:58,143 --> 00:46:04,287
I mean even even if he had a certified multiple Miracles involving your grandmother

857
00:46:04,543 --> 00:46:05,823
I wouldn't know where they put out those

858
00:46:06,335 --> 00:46:08,127
Because apparently they put him out annually

859
00:46:12,223 --> 00:46:16,063
You would have to just be like hey

860
00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:22,463
H-E-B like your grandmother

861
00:46:27,839 --> 00:46:29,375
I don't do Palau the French

862
00:46:29,887 --> 00:46:31,167
I don't believe it

863
00:46:32,447 --> 00:46:33,215
Huge

864
00:46:34,239 --> 00:46:35,007
I would say

865
00:46:35,263 --> 00:46:36,543
Nationally important

866
00:46:36,799 --> 00:46:38,335
Internationally important

867
00:46:38,591 --> 00:46:42,431
Globally important event that your grandmother's life

868
00:46:42,687 --> 00:46:44,223
And then your mom would be like

869
00:46:44,479 --> 00:46:46,015
Hey don't tell

870
00:46:46,271 --> 00:46:48,063
The kid about that until he's 25

871
00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:51,135
Or whatever there's no way

872
00:46:51,391 --> 00:46:54,719
Family Lawrence

873
00:46:54,975 --> 00:46:56,511
0 miracle

874
00:46:56,767 --> 00:46:57,279
Crazy

875
00:46:57,535 --> 00:46:58,559
Families have

876
00:46:58,815 --> 00:47:01,119
Masala jaising they're on their own path

877
00:47:01,375 --> 00:47:04,191
There's a there's an oral tradition

878
00:47:04,447 --> 00:47:06,239
There's no way that something this important

879
00:47:06,495 --> 00:47:07,007
Wouldn't be

880
00:47:07,263 --> 00:47:10,847
He can say that he didn't know until later but I just

881
00:47:11,103 --> 00:47:11,871
I find that to be

882
00:47:12,127 --> 00:47:12,639
Be Beyond

883
00:47:12,895 --> 00:47:14,175
Credulity

884
00:47:14,431 --> 00:47:15,967
Is one family trait that I have

885
00:47:16,479 --> 00:47:16,991
Throughout

886
00:47:19,039 --> 00:47:19,551
Modesty

887
00:47:20,063 --> 00:47:24,927
None of them want it look she doesn't want to brag

888
00:47:25,183 --> 00:47:25,951
Everybody's going to put it on

889
00:47:26,207 --> 00:47:26,975
Is LinkedIn

890
00:47:27,999 --> 00:47:29,535
That's just over it

891
00:47:30,047 --> 00:47:32,351
Miracle lids

892
00:47:32,607 --> 00:47:34,143
Twice listicle

893
00:47:34,399 --> 00:47:38,495
That's the grandma talk about it

894
00:47:39,263 --> 00:47:41,055
A really bad car accident

895
00:47:41,567 --> 00:47:45,663
In the car

896
00:47:45,919 --> 00:47:50,015
Okay

897
00:47:50,271 --> 00:47:51,551
Experience

898
00:47:51,807 --> 00:47:55,903
Okay

899
00:47:56,159 --> 00:47:56,671
Forward

900
00:47:58,463 --> 00:48:00,255
She went through Vista Noland

901
00:48:00,511 --> 00:48:01,791
She swept buddy you know

902
00:48:02,303 --> 00:48:02,815
Table 9

903
00:48:06,143 --> 00:48:06,911
White beans

904
00:48:08,447 --> 00:48:08,959
She told me that

905
00:48:10,495 --> 00:48:11,007
When she

906
00:48:11,263 --> 00:48:12,031
Talk to them

907
00:48:12,799 --> 00:48:14,335
Daddy said he's not your time yet

908
00:48:14,847 --> 00:48:15,359
Be coming back

909
00:48:16,127 --> 00:48:16,895
Your time is not ready yet

910
00:48:19,199 --> 00:48:21,247
And she came back with the heating

911
00:48:22,527 --> 00:48:23,039
Capacity

912
00:48:28,927 --> 00:48:30,207
She never promoted

913
00:48:31,231 --> 00:48:32,767
She always

914
00:48:33,279 --> 00:48:34,047
Westbrook

915
00:48:34,303 --> 00:48:35,071
Never had money from

916
00:48:35,583 --> 00:48:36,607
I give him money myself

917
00:48:39,167 --> 00:48:39,679
Retirement

918
00:48:40,191 --> 00:48:41,471
But she

919
00:48:41,727 --> 00:48:43,519
She never really made a fuss about that

920
00:48:44,287 --> 00:48:49,151
His mom died in a car accident light

921
00:48:49,407 --> 00:48:50,431
It turns out the archangel

922
00:48:50,943 --> 00:48:55,039
Okay and they tell her

923
00:48:55,295 --> 00:48:57,087
Healing powers

924
00:48:58,879 --> 00:48:59,391
Go people with

925
00:48:59,647 --> 00:49:05,791
I would like to know what level and how many like this you roll from a D6 to see how many hit

926
00:49:06,047 --> 00:49:09,631
That she returns to people with their severe burn would like

927
00:49:09,887 --> 00:49:12,191
The timeline on this

928
00:49:12,447 --> 00:49:13,727
Tickets all that clear but

929
00:49:13,983 --> 00:49:15,007
I assume this this song

930
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:16,031
Part of

931
00:49:17,311 --> 00:49:17,823
Grandma

932
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:18,847
Couple miracle

933
00:49:19,103 --> 00:49:19,615
Right

934
00:49:26,271 --> 00:49:28,575
But my story by lineage

935
00:49:28,831 --> 00:49:31,391
Really out classic

936
00:49:31,647 --> 00:49:35,487
Going to need to have met Zoar

937
00:49:35,999 --> 00:49:39,071
A bit of

938
00:49:40,095 --> 00:49:42,655
The elements are all their family history of

939
00:49:43,167 --> 00:49:48,543
Sort of grandiose by a normal type stuff received

940
00:49:48,799 --> 00:49:50,847
The timeline of this like

941
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:53,151
Matching up with highly stressful life

942
00:49:54,175 --> 00:49:56,991
And now he gets to another stressful event

943
00:49:57,247 --> 00:49:58,783
That's towards the end of his

944
00:49:59,039 --> 00:49:59,807
Is useful

945
00:50:00,063 --> 00:50:00,575
Vision

946
00:50:02,111 --> 00:50:02,623
Looks terrible

947
00:50:03,135 --> 00:50:05,951
When I was 16 I had that she had a lot of things happening

948
00:50:11,327 --> 00:50:14,143
I wasn't avoiding school so I basically

949
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:17,471
Beach hiking with a Bojangles

950
00:50:21,055 --> 00:50:23,359
And I said doing classes

951
00:50:24,383 --> 00:50:25,151
I had

952
00:50:25,663 --> 00:50:26,687
Automatic writing

953
00:50:26,943 --> 00:50:27,455
Just write that

954
00:50:27,711 --> 00:50:28,479
Foreign language

955
00:50:28,735 --> 00:50:29,503
Canadian language

956
00:50:30,015 --> 00:50:32,575
From top to bottom and left right

957
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:34,879
And I know you would have meant

958
00:50:35,135 --> 00:50:36,671
But it was the one.

959
00:50:38,975 --> 00:50:39,743
Yogi's

960
00:50:39,999 --> 00:50:42,815
Chinese language

961
00:50:43,071 --> 00:50:43,839
Because how to

962
00:50:44,095 --> 00:50:44,863
And I I had

963
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:46,143
Books dealing with this

964
00:50:46,399 --> 00:50:47,935
Because I travel so much

965
00:50:48,447 --> 00:50:50,239
My dad when you moved away

966
00:50:50,495 --> 00:50:52,031
Throughout everything that I own

967
00:50:55,103 --> 00:50:57,407
Even the oschino the stuff that I had

968
00:50:57,919 --> 00:50:58,431
She's gone

969
00:51:08,415 --> 00:51:14,559
Notebooks the world that I automatically roll but unfortunately my dad's

970
00:51:14,815 --> 00:51:18,655
Rudolph

971
00:51:19,423 --> 00:51:22,751
And that may also have contributed to his

972
00:51:23,263 --> 00:51:24,031
Visions from

973
00:51:24,287 --> 00:51:30,431
5:48 speculate just based on the information that we have

974
00:51:32,991 --> 00:51:35,295
In terms of the story as the one who

975
00:51:35,551 --> 00:51:41,695
Has precluded him from proving his story mom and grandmother about pitched

976
00:51:42,207 --> 00:51:43,231
Heroic elements

977
00:51:45,535 --> 00:51:49,887
Even if these notebooks thrown away

978
00:51:50,143 --> 00:51:53,471
They look at a notebook

979
00:51:53,727 --> 00:51:57,823
Or whatever

980
00:51:59,359 --> 00:52:03,711
He is very much like the sixty-year-old who suddenly

981
00:52:03,967 --> 00:52:04,479
Wearing a

982
00:52:05,759 --> 00:52:07,039
Pinterest you know it's busy

983
00:52:07,295 --> 00:52:08,575
He's clearly his affect

984
00:52:09,343 --> 00:52:13,951
Look up automatically

985
00:52:14,207 --> 00:52:14,975
In person just B Mike

986
00:52:15,231 --> 00:52:15,743
A complete lack of

987
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:22,143
Next clip

988
00:52:22,399 --> 00:52:27,007
Where he discusses how he learn to astral travel

989
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:30,591
Something in those offenses a girl that that

990
00:52:30,847 --> 00:52:31,871
And I

991
00:52:32,127 --> 00:52:32,895
Was trying to

992
00:52:34,175 --> 00:52:35,199
Empresa

993
00:52:35,967 --> 00:52:37,247
And I said okay

994
00:52:37,503 --> 00:52:38,783
You know I did meditation

995
00:52:40,575 --> 00:52:41,343
My mother

996
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:42,879
Cuz she does love reasoning

997
00:52:43,647 --> 00:52:46,975
Adidas

998
00:52:47,487 --> 00:52:50,047
I would like to do a test and

999
00:52:50,815 --> 00:52:52,095
And replace

1000
00:52:52,863 --> 00:52:53,375
An object

1001
00:52:53,887 --> 00:52:54,655
On your night table

1002
00:52:57,727 --> 00:53:00,543
And I never said it before but I could do it

1003
00:53:01,055 --> 00:53:01,823
And so

1004
00:53:02,335 --> 00:53:03,871
The same night I went to

1005
00:53:04,127 --> 00:53:04,639
My bedroom

1006
00:53:06,431 --> 00:53:07,455
Lay down in the bed

1007
00:53:07,967 --> 00:53:11,807
And instead of a sitting down when do tri-central midday shannan

1008
00:53:13,343 --> 00:53:14,879
I was just laying down

1009
00:53:16,159 --> 00:53:16,927
Who sing on was

1010
00:53:19,231 --> 00:53:20,255
We'll get back to this here in a second

1011
00:53:21,535 --> 00:53:22,303
The idea that

1012
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:23,071
You just sort of

1013
00:53:23,583 --> 00:53:24,351
Talk again

1014
00:53:24,607 --> 00:53:27,679
His mom taught him how to Transcendental Meditation

1015
00:53:28,191 --> 00:53:28,959
He's not on

1016
00:53:30,495 --> 00:53:32,287
Because that means his mom was into that

1017
00:53:32,543 --> 00:53:33,567
Younger and

1018
00:53:33,823 --> 00:53:34,335
You know

1019
00:53:35,103 --> 00:53:37,151
Without getting into libelous territory

1020
00:53:37,407 --> 00:53:37,919
Slander

1021
00:53:38,943 --> 00:53:40,479
People believe that

1022
00:53:40,735 --> 00:53:41,247
He's kind of a cult

1023
00:53:41,759 --> 00:53:43,295
And also there have been something

1024
00:53:43,551 --> 00:53:44,575
People have reported that

1025
00:53:44,831 --> 00:53:45,343
Canby

1026
00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:47,647
Like a kind of dangerous practice

1027
00:53:48,415 --> 00:53:50,463
Especially for children that's

1028
00:53:51,231 --> 00:53:51,999
Because it is just

1029
00:53:52,255 --> 00:53:54,303
Repeating over and over and over again

1030
00:53:54,815 --> 00:53:55,839
20 minutes

1031
00:53:56,095 --> 00:53:57,631
Eddy Kim take you in Tucson

1032
00:53:58,655 --> 00:54:00,447
Hypnotic

1033
00:54:00,959 --> 00:54:03,519
Like it is it is something that an unformed brain

1034
00:54:04,031 --> 00:54:04,799
Would be dangerous for them

1035
00:54:07,359 --> 00:54:08,127
9

1036
00:54:08,639 --> 00:54:09,407
Let It Go soft

1037
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:13,247
What is boarding school

1038
00:54:14,015 --> 00:54:15,807
I think there's some dangerous element

1039
00:54:16,831 --> 00:54:18,367
But he wants to impress

1040
00:54:18,623 --> 00:54:19,647
This girl so we can get

1041
00:54:19,903 --> 00:54:21,695
It gets into his meditative state

1042
00:54:22,207 --> 00:54:24,255
And astrally travels into her bed

1043
00:54:26,815 --> 00:54:27,583
That's what that was

1044
00:54:27,839 --> 00:54:28,351
84

1045
00:54:29,887 --> 00:54:31,679
And I became out to my buddy

1046
00:54:33,215 --> 00:54:35,007
I was being fooled very fast

1047
00:54:35,263 --> 00:54:36,543
Black tunnel

1048
00:54:36,799 --> 00:54:38,591
An auto accident I was involved

1049
00:54:39,103 --> 00:54:41,407
The night table

1050
00:54:41,919 --> 00:54:42,943
Jexi

1051
00:54:43,199 --> 00:54:44,223
I just want the three

1052
00:54:44,735 --> 00:54:47,039
And I described them as

1053
00:54:47,551 --> 00:54:48,063
Necklace

1054
00:54:49,343 --> 00:54:50,111
It was a rain

1055
00:54:51,903 --> 00:54:52,671
Danica surrounded

1056
00:54:53,183 --> 00:54:54,207
And that's sweet

1057
00:54:54,463 --> 00:54:55,487
Inter inter inter

1058
00:54:58,303 --> 00:54:58,815
Notepad

1059
00:54:59,071 --> 00:54:59,583
On the side

1060
00:55:01,631 --> 00:55:06,239
VeggieTales no pasta get out of my f****** room

1061
00:55:08,031 --> 00:55:08,799
I just came back from a

1062
00:55:10,335 --> 00:55:13,407
When I open my eyes I was sweating profusely and I was out of breath

1063
00:55:13,663 --> 00:55:14,431
Reschedule

1064
00:55:14,687 --> 00:55:16,479
You for real broken throughout

1065
00:55:16,991 --> 00:55:18,271
And but

1066
00:55:19,807 --> 00:55:22,879
I didn't I was just happy to

1067
00:55:23,135 --> 00:55:26,975
I can't wait to go back in the morning and tell the girl that's what I've seen

1068
00:55:27,999 --> 00:55:28,511
Soja.

1069
00:55:32,351 --> 00:55:33,375
You know she freaked out

1070
00:55:35,423 --> 00:55:37,983
House

1071
00:55:40,799 --> 00:55:41,567
Looked in her window or some

1072
00:55:44,127 --> 00:55:46,431
If that story is even real I don't

1073
00:55:46,687 --> 00:55:47,455
Believe that

1074
00:55:47,711 --> 00:55:49,247
Proves that he actually traveled

1075
00:55:49,759 --> 00:55:54,623
Emmett furthermore necklace and a ring Independence

1076
00:55:55,135 --> 00:55:55,903
That's not like

1077
00:55:56,415 --> 00:55:59,231
Really high-end predictions for

1078
00:55:59,743 --> 00:56:01,791
Teenage girl to have on her nightstand

1079
00:56:05,887 --> 00:56:06,911
If it was something

1080
00:56:07,167 --> 00:56:13,311
F***** up like some really weird

1081
00:56:13,567 --> 00:56:19,711
Window

1082
00:56:20,479 --> 00:56:21,247
Nothing

1083
00:56:21,759 --> 00:56:22,271
Any of it

1084
00:56:23,039 --> 00:56:27,135
Mostly easily could have turned into that

1085
00:56:27,391 --> 00:56:29,695
That Medium conman kind of thing

1086
00:56:30,207 --> 00:56:32,255
He's telling her small bits of information

1087
00:56:32,511 --> 00:56:33,279
And she's giving him

1088
00:56:33,535 --> 00:56:35,327
Larger bits of information.

1089
00:56:35,583 --> 00:56:36,095
Suggest

1090
00:56:38,911 --> 00:56:39,679
Speaking of which

1091
00:56:40,447 --> 00:56:41,727
Sebastian

1092
00:56:41,983 --> 00:56:44,287
Gets mixed up with someone who might have been doing that to him

1093
00:56:44,799 --> 00:56:47,359
And that is a hypnotherapist

1094
00:56:53,759 --> 00:56:55,807
This is the most suggestive of human being

1095
00:56:56,063 --> 00:57:00,415
Any goes to hypnotherapist

1096
00:57:00,671 --> 00:57:01,695
That teaches him

1097
00:57:01,951 --> 00:57:04,511
About the

1098
00:57:05,023 --> 00:57:06,047
Just go to the meditative

1099
00:57:07,071 --> 00:57:07,583
It's not always

1100
00:57:07,839 --> 00:57:08,351
Nefarious

1101
00:57:08,607 --> 00:57:09,119
Super weird

1102
00:57:09,375 --> 00:57:10,399
There are

1103
00:57:10,911 --> 00:57:11,935
Therapeutic benefit

1104
00:57:12,191 --> 00:57:13,727
One of the big surf

1105
00:57:13,983 --> 00:57:15,007
Benefits

1106
00:57:15,775 --> 00:57:17,055
Go to dealing with anxiety

1107
00:57:17,311 --> 00:57:18,591
You're good with dealing with so

1108
00:57:19,103 --> 00:57:19,615
Stress

1109
00:57:19,871 --> 00:57:21,151
Which might be part of

1110
00:57:21,407 --> 00:57:21,919
What causes

1111
00:57:22,175 --> 00:57:23,455
Precipitated

1112
00:57:23,711 --> 00:57:24,223
These visions

1113
00:57:24,991 --> 00:57:26,271
Now that's tough.

1114
00:57:26,527 --> 00:57:29,855
So it doesn't surprise me at all that he starts talking about this selfie

1115
00:57:30,111 --> 00:57:30,623
Hypnosis

1116
00:57:32,927 --> 00:57:34,463
Started to go to them

1117
00:57:34,719 --> 00:57:37,535
The vision stop being upset again

1118
00:57:37,791 --> 00:57:39,327
There is also. So assertive

1119
00:57:39,583 --> 00:57:40,351
Strange things

1120
00:57:41,631 --> 00:57:44,703
Years later you going to this hypnotist

1121
00:57:45,215 --> 00:57:45,727
Clinical

1122
00:57:46,239 --> 00:57:47,007
Psychologist

1123
00:57:49,311 --> 00:57:50,847
You're asking to be Hobbit

1124
00:57:51,359 --> 00:57:53,407
Either the Visions removed or or

1125
00:57:53,663 --> 00:57:56,735
Trolled the same time you did learn

1126
00:57:56,991 --> 00:57:58,527
Meditation

1127
00:57:59,039 --> 00:58:00,063
Yes

1128
00:58:00,319 --> 00:58:01,855
She taught you how to

1129
00:58:02,367 --> 00:58:04,415
Do self hypnosis Scripts

1130
00:58:05,183 --> 00:58:06,207
Not a big difference

1131
00:58:06,463 --> 00:58:08,767
Between Modesto

1132
00:58:09,023 --> 00:58:14,911
I'm really something she didn't know or

1133
00:58:15,935 --> 00:58:17,471
Did you feel at work

1134
00:58:17,983 --> 00:58:18,751
Yes

1135
00:58:19,007 --> 00:58:20,799
I was able to

1136
00:58:22,591 --> 00:58:23,359
Have them on.

1137
00:58:24,639 --> 00:58:25,151
Which is

1138
00:58:25,663 --> 00:58:27,711
Something I messed up doing pressure

1139
00:58:29,247 --> 00:58:31,551
And I just said to you

1140
00:58:31,807 --> 00:58:37,951

Didn't reset from

1142
00:58:39,487 --> 00:58:40,767
Anxiety and stress

1143
00:58:41,279 --> 00:58:42,559
That's for you to have

1144
00:58:43,071 --> 00:58:44,095
Back in 2010

1145
00:58:47,167 --> 00:58:47,679
Comfortable

1146
00:58:48,703 --> 00:58:50,239
There's so many red flags and

1147
00:58:51,775 --> 00:58:53,311
Is describing his

1148
00:58:54,847 --> 00:58:55,359
Stuff like that

1149
00:58:55,615 --> 00:58:57,919
Responsible for carrying

1150
00:58:58,431 --> 00:58:59,199
Whether or not

1151
00:58:59,455 --> 00:59:01,247
He believes them because I know that she tries

1152
00:59:01,503 --> 00:59:02,015
Pretendplay

1153
00:59:02,527 --> 00:59:08,671
You can decide if resonate with you or not

1154
00:59:08,927 --> 00:59:15,071
Reinforcing

1155
00:59:15,327 --> 00:59:16,863
Like that

1156
00:59:17,375 --> 00:59:19,167
You guys got to decide that's or the shed

1157
00:59:19,935 --> 00:59:21,471
If she had any like

1158
00:59:21,727 --> 00:59:23,007
Interest in the truth

1159
00:59:23,263 --> 00:59:25,055
Even if she believes in Aliens

1160
00:59:25,311 --> 00:59:26,335
Play programming all day

1161
00:59:26,591 --> 00:59:27,359
She had any in

1162
00:59:27,615 --> 00:59:28,127
And the truth

1163
00:59:28,383 --> 00:59:29,151
She would be like

1164
00:59:29,407 --> 00:59:30,943
This story that you're telling me

1165
00:59:31,199 --> 00:59:31,967
Is really upsetting

1166
00:59:32,479 --> 00:59:34,527
Because you're clearly describing

1167
00:59:34,783 --> 00:59:38,879
A timeline through your life of Highly stressful anxious situation

1168
00:59:39,391 --> 00:59:41,439
Leading to you having delusions

1169
00:59:41,951 --> 00:59:43,231
That you were talking to alien

1170
00:59:43,487 --> 00:59:43,999
And what happened

1171
00:59:44,511 --> 00:59:45,279
Now

1172
00:59:45,535 --> 00:59:48,351
You're talkin to me about going to see this hypnotherapist

1173
00:59:48,607 --> 00:59:49,631
Afterwards

1174
00:59:50,143 --> 00:59:52,703
Your Stress and Anxiety that you felt about all this

1175
00:59:52,959 --> 00:59:57,567
When you're able to integrate the information that your experience

1176
00:59:57,823 --> 01:00:00,639
Scuse me Sebastian I have I have

1177
01:00:01,663 --> 01:00:02,175
Occam's razor

1178
01:00:04,479 --> 01:00:05,247
She should watch

1179
01:00:05,503 --> 01:00:06,783
Call this out

1180
01:00:07,039 --> 01:00:08,319
Because if she doesn't

1181
01:00:08,831 --> 01:00:10,623
It looks like she's supporting it

1182
01:00:10,879 --> 01:00:13,695
And that hurts her larger argument about aliens

1183
01:00:13,951 --> 01:00:14,463
Space

1184
01:00:14,719 --> 01:00:15,999
Because this is a piece of it

1185
01:00:16,511 --> 01:00:19,839
To talk about this s***

1186
01:00:22,399 --> 01:00:24,447
A lack of seriousness

1187
01:00:24,703 --> 01:00:26,495
Of course

1188
01:00:26,751 --> 01:00:27,775
Even in the gold

1189
01:00:28,287 --> 01:00:29,055
She professes

1190
01:00:29,311 --> 01:00:29,823
To be interested

1191
01:00:30,079 --> 01:00:31,359
Right now the reason that you

1192
01:00:31,615 --> 01:00:32,639
She can't do that

1193
01:00:32,895 --> 01:00:34,943
Is just more like

1194
01:00:35,199 --> 01:00:36,479
These ghosts

1195
01:00:36,735 --> 01:00:39,295
If they find out that they

1196
01:00:39,551 --> 01:00:41,599
If they go on her show

1197
01:00:41,855 --> 01:00:44,159
She might challenge them right

1198
01:00:44,927 --> 01:00:49,791
She they're not going to go on her show you know

1199
01:00:50,047 --> 01:00:50,559
Because

1200
01:00:51,071 --> 01:00:56,447
If she starts challenging one a****** it's got to be every a****** and none of them can stand up

1201
01:00:57,215 --> 01:01:02,079
No not really not really but I do empathize

1202
01:01:02,335 --> 01:01:03,103
The situation

1203
01:01:03,359 --> 01:01:04,127
Sebastian Martinez

1204
01:01:04,383 --> 01:01:05,151
Describe

1205
01:01:05,407 --> 01:01:07,967
I don't like how he's deciding to go about his life

1206
01:01:08,223 --> 01:01:11,039
Book about being black with friends

1207
01:01:11,295 --> 01:01:12,831
That's helpful

1208
01:01:13,087 --> 01:01:16,159
But I do empathize them you're not in the same way that you see that

1209
01:01:16,671 --> 01:01:17,951
Image of somebody who's like

1210
01:01:18,207 --> 01:01:19,743
Clearly working a con now

1211
01:01:19,999 --> 01:01:25,119
Was a terrified child having nightmares of a haunted shed

1212
01:01:25,375 --> 01:01:31,263
Poor relationship with his dad empathize with responsible

1213
01:01:31,519 --> 01:01:32,543
Four people around

1214
01:01:32,799 --> 01:01:33,567
M2

1215
01:01:33,823 --> 01:01:34,591
Humor this stuff

1216
01:01:35,103 --> 01:01:36,895
You know I don't think you should like

1217
01:01:37,407 --> 01:01:38,687
If you if I was friends

1218
01:01:38,943 --> 01:01:39,455
I don't think

1219
01:01:39,711 --> 01:01:40,479
Bi-Rite to be like

1220
01:01:40,735 --> 01:01:45,599
Higher f****** idiot you are beautifully laelia abusing about this stuff

1221
01:01:45,855 --> 01:01:48,159
Equally abusive

1222
01:01:48,415 --> 01:01:51,231
Tell me about

1223
01:01:51,487 --> 01:01:53,279
Isn't it cool that you want on spaceship

1224
01:01:53,535 --> 01:01:56,351
But that's not okay that's that's just

1225
01:01:58,911 --> 01:01:59,423
Situations where

1226
01:01:59,679 --> 01:02:01,471
If your Mom and Grandma were

1227
01:02:01,727 --> 01:02:02,239
Both f***

1228
01:02:03,007 --> 01:02:03,519
Like

1229
01:02:03,775 --> 01:02:04,799
Performing miracle

1230
01:02:05,055 --> 01:02:05,567
Left and right

1231
01:02:05,823 --> 01:02:08,127
You would have just gone to a normal psychiatrist

1232
01:02:08,383 --> 01:02:08,895
Instead of

1233
01:02:09,663 --> 01:02:12,991
Interesting

1234
01:02:13,247 --> 01:02:19,391
Did get some modicum of benefits

1235
01:02:19,647 --> 01:02:23,999
Unfair

1236
01:02:24,255 --> 01:02:25,023
Discipline

1237
01:02:25,279 --> 01:02:26,047
Reset the session

1238
01:02:28,863 --> 01:02:35,007
Recovering memory which is one of the problems with these like sort of regret

1239
01:02:35,263 --> 01:02:37,823
Gresham therapeutic suggestion

1240
01:02:38,079 --> 01:02:39,615
That are easily implantable

1241
01:02:40,639 --> 01:02:42,943
It's not always like the therapist trying to

1242
01:02:43,199 --> 01:02:43,967
To do that

1243
01:02:44,223 --> 01:02:45,503
It said it's a really

1244
01:02:47,807 --> 01:02:48,831
To navigate and most

1245
01:02:51,135 --> 01:02:53,695
Things responsibly you end up walking away with it with

1246
01:02:54,207 --> 01:02:55,231
False memories

1247
01:02:55,487 --> 01:02:56,767
That because of the

1248
01:02:57,023 --> 01:02:58,047
Regression hypnotherapy

1249
01:02:58,559 --> 01:03:00,095
You validate and now single

1250
01:03:00,607 --> 01:03:06,239
There's the famous daycare people who

1251
01:03:07,519 --> 01:03:09,823
You goes to this

1252
01:03:10,079 --> 01:03:11,615
Hypnotherapy

1253
01:03:12,639 --> 01:03:13,407
And

1254
01:03:14,175 --> 01:03:14,943
He ends up

1255
01:03:16,735 --> 01:03:17,503
Figuring out

1256
01:03:18,015 --> 01:03:19,295
That it's fixed

1257
01:03:19,551 --> 01:03:22,111
He was taken up to spaceship Byhalia

1258
01:03:22,367 --> 01:03:23,903
Course and

1259
01:03:24,159 --> 01:03:24,927
He's there

1260
01:03:25,183 --> 01:03:26,207
He's on the ship

1261
01:03:26,463 --> 01:03:27,487
Himself

1262
01:03:27,743 --> 01:03:28,255
As a baby

1263
01:03:28,767 --> 01:03:31,583
Caesar the 6-month old version of himself

1264
01:03:35,679 --> 01:03:36,959
A couple of aliens arguing

1265
01:03:37,215 --> 01:03:37,727
With each other

1266
01:03:39,519 --> 01:03:41,311
Hypnotherapist tells him

1267
01:03:41,567 --> 01:03:42,591
What are they arguing about

1268
01:03:43,103 --> 01:03:43,615
I don't know

1269
01:03:43,871 --> 01:03:44,895
So she asks him

1270
01:03:45,151 --> 01:03:47,199
Ask the aliens

1271
01:03:47,967 --> 01:03:48,991
And so we jumped

1272
01:03:49,247 --> 01:03:50,783
And we receive

1273
01:03:53,599 --> 01:03:54,623
The aliens tell him

1274
01:03:54,879 --> 01:03:55,647
We can't touch you

1275
01:03:55,903 --> 01:03:57,183
You because you've been tampered

1276
01:03:58,207 --> 01:04:01,535
You don't understand what that means

1277
01:04:02,559 --> 01:04:03,583
That because I blacked out

1278
01:04:04,863 --> 01:04:05,631
Promethazine

1279
01:04:06,143 --> 01:04:07,679
I went backwards

1280
01:04:10,495 --> 01:04:12,287
A six-month-old baby

1281
01:04:14,335 --> 01:04:15,615
And I was going to see

1282
01:04:16,127 --> 01:04:17,407
With a glass Dome

1283
01:04:17,919 --> 01:04:20,479
He was like a Omega symbols on the seam

1284
01:04:20,735 --> 01:04:21,503
2

1285
01:04:23,551 --> 01:04:24,831
Fancy glass with a

1286
01:04:25,087 --> 01:04:26,111
Middle

1287
01:04:26,623 --> 01:04:28,415
And it was a black liquid inside

1288
01:04:28,927 --> 01:04:29,951
Organic

1289
01:04:35,071 --> 01:04:36,863
Which was whiskey covering my buddy

1290
01:04:37,631 --> 01:04:38,911
And Through the Glass

1291
01:04:40,959 --> 01:04:42,751
Gladion so about 7

1292
01:04:43,775 --> 01:04:46,591
2 radians we're also about 72

1293
01:04:47,871 --> 01:04:49,151
Do not despise

1294
01:04:55,807 --> 01:04:56,831
And so when are you

1295
01:04:57,599 --> 01:05:03,487
When I saw the play against they were wearing exactly the same blue uniform Missoula when I swim in my living room

1296
01:05:03,743 --> 01:05:06,047
Beehive that's upside down triangle on the chest

1297
01:05:06,815 --> 01:05:11,423
And the Manitou Beach and you had a helmet

1298
01:05:19,871 --> 01:05:21,407
Trident symbol on his forehead

1299
01:05:22,687 --> 01:05:25,759
And the new one was next to him and she was as tall as you are

1300
01:05:26,015 --> 01:05:27,295
Both

1301
01:05:27,807 --> 01:05:28,319
Drake

1302
01:05:29,087 --> 01:05:32,159
Right

1303
01:05:33,951 --> 01:05:34,463
Currency

1304
01:05:37,535 --> 01:05:38,047
Cumulative

1305
01:05:45,727 --> 01:05:47,263
It it really started me

1306
01:05:47,519 --> 01:05:48,287
And that's what I

1307
01:05:50,335 --> 01:05:53,151
Because I knew that that was no longer imagine

1308
01:05:53,663 --> 01:05:55,967
Crystal clear

1309
01:05:56,223 --> 01:05:58,527
You were that big

1310
01:05:59,039 --> 01:06:01,599
So he had the power

1311
01:06:02,111 --> 01:06:05,951
Earlier in this episode

1312
01:06:09,791 --> 01:06:12,607
Killed when he was 6 months old

1313
01:06:13,375 --> 01:06:14,911
These are not specific with what the

1314
01:06:15,167 --> 01:06:19,007
Condition

1315
01:06:19,263 --> 01:06:23,871
He is recovering memories of being a six-month-old taken up by the Palladium

1316
01:06:24,127 --> 01:06:25,663
Who healed his skin condition

1317
01:06:25,919 --> 01:06:26,687
Which is

1318
01:06:28,479 --> 01:06:28,991
Dubious

1319
01:06:34,623 --> 01:06:36,671
Easy there is either aliens

1320
01:06:39,487 --> 01:06:40,255
Or was

1321
01:06:40,511 --> 01:06:41,279
Medicine

1322
01:06:43,839 --> 01:06:44,863
He's only 6 months old

1323
01:06:46,143 --> 01:06:46,655
Yeah

1324
01:06:46,911 --> 01:06:50,239
Is the issue that

1325
01:06:50,495 --> 01:06:51,007
It could

1326
01:06:52,031 --> 01:06:57,151
You're seeing depressed is that his mom over the course of his life

1327
01:06:57,407 --> 01:07:03,551
Hey told him you were born with this condition know that you would survive

1328
01:07:03,807 --> 01:07:04,319
Yugioh

1329
01:07:04,575 --> 01:07:06,367
And he has really

1330
01:07:06,623 --> 01:07:10,207
Overbuilt

1331
01:07:10,463 --> 01:07:13,023
Horrible kind of

1332
01:07:17,119 --> 01:07:20,447
You are born with

1333
01:07:20,703 --> 01:07:21,215
This condition

1334
01:07:21,471 --> 01:07:22,239
Medicine

1335
01:07:22,495 --> 01:07:23,007
Took care of it

1336
01:07:23,519 --> 01:07:26,335
Lakeview there's a way there's a way that this is also a piece

1337
01:07:26,591 --> 01:07:30,431
A family lore being exaggerated misunderstood by a child

1338
01:07:30,687 --> 01:07:32,479
So I still don't hear anything

1339
01:07:34,015 --> 01:07:34,783
That's all I'm saying

1340
01:07:35,295 --> 01:07:37,855
What were the air that the aliens are just arguing like

1341
01:07:38,111 --> 01:07:40,927
What are you doing

1342
01:07:41,183 --> 01:07:45,279
I think it'll be good for us

1343
01:07:46,559 --> 01:07:48,607
It turns out actually

1344
01:07:52,959 --> 01:07:55,263
Is a hybrid or something like that

1345
01:07:55,519 --> 01:07:56,543
Of course

1346
01:07:56,799 --> 01:07:58,079
And he's also part goat

1347
01:08:02,431 --> 01:08:04,991
Memories

1348
01:08:06,271 --> 01:08:07,295
Experience is all this

1349
01:08:07,551 --> 01:08:08,319
Therapy

1350
01:08:08,575 --> 01:08:10,367
I asked him is like

1351
01:08:10,623 --> 01:08:11,903
Read any stuff about

1352
01:08:13,183 --> 01:08:13,695
All this s***

1353
01:08:13,951 --> 01:08:14,463
Before

1354
01:08:14,719 --> 01:08:18,303
He had these experiences

1355
01:08:18,559 --> 01:08:24,703
I meant later in the episode

1356
01:08:27,263 --> 01:08:33,407
Because it's not like you says I didn't read any of that but then afterwards I was so interested that I dug in and red

1357
01:08:35,199 --> 01:08:36,991
He says I'm not interested in any of that

1358
01:08:37,247 --> 01:08:37,759
Nonsense

1359
01:08:38,015 --> 01:08:40,319
I only want to talk about what my experience

1360
01:08:40,575 --> 01:08:42,111
I based on the fact that he's reference

1361
01:08:43,135 --> 01:08:45,183
Greer later in the episode and things like that

1362
01:08:45,439 --> 01:08:46,975
Hold on man

1363
01:08:47,231 --> 01:08:48,511
You are interested in this

1364
01:08:48,767 --> 01:08:50,559
Lying about not being

1365
01:08:50,815 --> 01:08:51,583
Interested in order to

1366
01:08:51,839 --> 01:08:56,447
Information just comes from me and I'll believe that

1367
01:08:56,703 --> 01:08:57,471
Because he can't

1368
01:08:57,727 --> 01:08:59,775
I have read all of those books of his information

1369
01:09:00,031 --> 01:09:00,543
Lines up

1370
01:09:00,799 --> 01:09:04,639
Really closely with those but bacon people should be like

1371
01:09:05,407 --> 01:09:06,431
Right

1372
01:09:06,687 --> 01:09:11,039
You can't have known about his grandma's certified miracles

1373
01:09:11,295 --> 01:09:13,087
Earlier in life

1374
01:09:13,343 --> 01:09:14,367
Call into question

1375
01:09:14,623 --> 01:09:17,439
Where would you get these sorts of ideas from

1376
01:09:18,207 --> 01:09:18,719
It's there

1377
01:09:20,255 --> 01:09:21,023
After this

1378
01:09:21,279 --> 01:09:21,791
You hanging out

1379
01:09:22,303 --> 01:09:22,815
He's jealous

1380
01:09:23,071 --> 01:09:28,191
Running a business

1381
01:09:30,751 --> 01:09:32,031
Revisiting

1382
01:09:33,567 --> 01:09:35,615
Just an invitation

1383
01:09:35,871 --> 01:09:41,247
Why don't you come on my spaceship or 5 ft tall and the other alien 7

1384
01:09:41,503 --> 01:09:42,271
I'm Not Dead

1385
01:09:42,527 --> 01:09:43,039
Something I'm

1386
01:09:43,551 --> 01:09:44,575
Literally not interested

1387
01:09:48,415 --> 01:09:50,463
Details

1388
01:09:51,231 --> 01:09:52,511
I don't give a s***

1389
01:09:53,023 --> 01:09:54,303
I don't give a s*** at all

1390
01:09:54,559 --> 01:09:56,863
Thompson comes back is okay buddy

1391
01:09:57,375 --> 01:09:58,143
Come Joyride

1392
01:09:58,655 --> 01:09:59,167
Spaceship

1393
01:09:59,423 --> 01:10:01,215
And Sebastian

1394
01:10:03,007 --> 01:10:04,543
Scared

1395
01:10:04,799 --> 01:10:05,567
To go on the spaceship

1396
01:10:05,823 --> 01:10:06,335
F****** a******

1397
01:10:07,103 --> 01:10:08,639
So basically went

1398
01:10:08,895 --> 01:10:09,663
How is my house

1399
01:10:09,919 --> 01:10:10,431
Again

1400
01:10:10,687 --> 01:10:12,991
And and we'll come back again the same way they did

1401
01:10:14,783 --> 01:10:16,319
What are you nuts come with me

1402
01:10:16,575 --> 01:10:17,343
On the space

1403
01:10:18,111 --> 01:10:19,903
And I didn't like that

1404
01:10:20,671 --> 01:10:21,183
I didn't want to

1405
01:10:21,695 --> 01:10:22,975
And I said that

1406
01:10:23,231 --> 01:10:25,023
No I'm sorry but I think I stay home

1407
01:10:27,327 --> 01:10:33,471
Play Spotify

1408
01:10:34,495 --> 01:10:38,847
And I even contacted e-plus therapist and I said I would like to

1409
01:10:39,103 --> 01:10:40,383
No be regressed

1410
01:10:40,639 --> 01:10:41,151
2

1411
01:10:42,431 --> 01:10:44,735
Maybe welcome the idea of being on the spaceship

1412
01:10:45,503 --> 01:10:47,295
Resort if you welcome me

1413
01:10:47,807 --> 01:10:49,343
And we see where that where it is

1414
01:10:50,623 --> 01:10:52,159
So she could have let me through that

1415
01:10:52,415 --> 01:10:53,183
That's not good

1416
01:10:53,695 --> 01:10:55,743
License

1417
01:10:56,255 --> 01:10:58,559
Real hypnotherapist probably wouldn't

1418
01:10:58,815 --> 01:11:00,607
Except a session where someone was like

1419
01:11:00,863 --> 01:11:07,007
Alien invited me on MySpace

1420
01:11:14,175 --> 01:11:16,479
I'm sorry that sounds really tough

1421
01:11:16,735 --> 01:11:19,039
I am going to have to Triple my usual hourly

1422
01:11:19,551 --> 01:11:20,575
So it'll be about 300

1423
01:11:20,831 --> 01:11:22,879
I did say

1424
01:11:23,135 --> 01:11:25,439
Credible ethical hypnotherapist

1425
01:11:26,463 --> 01:11:28,767
I don't know I just hear

1426
01:11:29,279 --> 01:11:35,167
I hear either this hypnotherapist is made up for like it's just someone real Shady

1427
01:11:35,423 --> 01:11:36,959
Real shaky

1428
01:11:45,919 --> 01:11:47,967
Okay

1429
01:11:48,223 --> 01:11:49,247
So it works

1430
01:11:49,503 --> 01:11:55,647
He doesn't still pissed off that he didn't take that trip was or he does though

1431
01:11:55,903 --> 01:11:57,183
He ends up making peace with it

1432
01:11:57,439 --> 01:11:59,743
Getting up to that does

1433
01:11:59,999 --> 01:12:01,279
He finds out what his mission is

1434
01:12:02,047 --> 01:12:04,863
When was

1435
01:12:05,119 --> 01:12:05,631

01:12:06,911 --> 01:12:08,191
Open up

1438
01:12:08,447 --> 01:12:11,775
He was Rydell

1439
01:12:12,287 --> 01:12:16,383
And in the background

1440
01:12:16,639 --> 01:12:17,407
And woman one of us

1441
01:12:17,663 --> 01:12:21,503
Azure is a bad weather

1442
01:12:24,063 --> 01:12:25,087

Winning Lotto

1449
01:12:43,519 --> 01:12:47,359
Just the reason that they care about Heights is it different alien races have like

1450
01:12:47,615 --> 01:12:48,383
Different

1451
01:12:48,639 --> 01:12:50,175

1463
01:13:30,367 --> 01:13:30,879

He's not supposed to be here

1469
01:13:44,447 --> 01:13:45,471
Enzo said Noah

They said

1473

That's when

1474

You were better now

1475
01:13:59,807 --> 01:14:00,575

1476
01:14:01,087 --> 01:14:01,855
The US opposed

1477
01:14:02,111 --> 01:14:03,135
A life

1478
01:14:03,391 --> 01:14:04,671
You know basic life on Earth

1479
01:14:06,463 --> 01:14:06,975
Emotions

1480
01:14:07,743 --> 01:14:08,255

Come back to us

I said okay

1484
01:14:18,751 --> 01:14:23,103
And then he said that but now you'll mission

1485
01:14:23,359 --> 01:14:24,127

1486
01:14:25,663 --> 01:14:27,199
Going back to us

Okay

1489
01:14:33,087 --> 01:14:34,623
But I had no clue what that meant

1490
01:14:34,879 --> 01:14:35,903
And that's wasted

1491
01:14:36,159 --> 01:14:38,975
Whose sole message that arose from this conversation

1492
01:14:39,231 --> 01:14:39,999
Okay

1493
01:14:41,535 --> 01:14:44,863

01:14:47,679 --> 01:14:48,703
To become a space

1496
01:14:49,471 --> 01:14:50,751
All right and now

You're coming up to me

You were going to have an easy life but now you got to go back down there and awake and all them goddamn Stars

You're going to be a honey impresario and then die when you die

1502
01:15:05,855 --> 01:15:07,391
Comebacks to your true form

1503
01:15:07,647 --> 01:15:08,927
Which is as an alien

1504
01:15:09,183 --> 01:15:15,327
And we're going to put you on Coast to Coast AM

Yes

1507
01:15:21,215 --> 01:15:22,495
I hear that it's like

1508
01:15:25,311 --> 01:15:27,871
That's that's a mess

1509
01:15:28,127 --> 01:15:29,151
Yeah I don't like those

1510
01:15:29,407 --> 01:15:31,967
Decision-making process if they are giving out jobs

1511
01:15:37,343 --> 01:15:38,367
It's so much of this

1512
01:15:38,623 --> 01:15:40,159
It just comes down to

1513
01:15:40,927 --> 01:15:42,975
None none of this can ever be

1514
01:15:43,999 --> 01:15:45,535
Play Kenny

1515
01:15:45,791 --> 01:15:47,327
Allegedly capable of doing

1516
01:15:47,839 --> 01:15:50,911
Conveniently

1517
01:15:51,167 --> 01:15:51,935
Languages anymore

1518
01:15:52,191 --> 01:15:52,703
Because

1519
01:15:53,215 --> 01:15:56,287
You know if you had that ability confirmable

1520
01:15:56,543 --> 01:15:57,567

01:15:58,079 --> 01:15:58,847
Mandarin

1522
01:15:59,103 --> 01:16:02,687
Right

1523
01:16:04,479 --> 01:16:06,271
I could do that when I was younger I can't do it now

1524
01:16:06,783 --> 01:16:10,623
Astral travel if that's real it would be so easy to confirm

1525
01:16:13,439 --> 01:16:16,511
Can do it

1526
01:16:16,767 --> 01:16:17,535
Is not the way you can

1527
01:16:17,791 --> 01:16:18,303
Confirm

1528
01:16:18,815 --> 01:16:19,327
Right

1529
01:16:20,863 --> 01:16:25,215
Maybe not.

1530
01:16:27,007 --> 01:16:28,031
Nonsense experience

1531
01:16:28,287 --> 01:16:29,823
Hypnotherapy session

1532
01:16:31,359 --> 01:16:32,127
You know

1533
01:16:35,199 --> 01:16:36,223

1534
01:16:36,479 --> 01:16:36,991
So

1535
01:16:40,575 --> 01:16:41,343
I hate that like

1536
01:16:42,111 --> 01:16:48,255
Now you are the only person who you're the most special person in the world

1537
01:16:48,511 --> 01:16:51,839
Picking up to like if we started this whole thing we were taking up to a spaceship

1538
01:16:52,095 --> 01:16:53,631
The mission would be like

1539
01:16:54,143 --> 01:16:57,983
Run a mildly successful podcast for electing s***

1540
01:17:02,335 --> 01:17:03,871
But mildly successful podcast

1541
01:17:04,127 --> 01:17:05,663
Hell yeah

1542
01:17:05,919 --> 01:17:08,479
Even secretary asks a very important question

1543
01:17:09,759 --> 01:17:10,783
How long were you in

1544
01:17:11,039 --> 01:17:11,807
Therapy

1545
01:17:12,319 --> 01:17:13,599
Like how long did that go on for

1546
01:17:14,111 --> 01:17:14,879
Question

1547
01:17:18,719 --> 01:17:19,231
Music

1548
01:17:19,743 --> 01:17:21,279
How long

1549
01:17:25,375 --> 01:17:26,399
Bald eagles

1550
01:17:26,655 --> 01:17:27,423
Eddie Muffler

1551
01:17:39,967 --> 01:17:40,991
He had other things to do

1552
01:17:41,759 --> 01:17:47,903
Jesus you uncover that you as a baby were taken up into a spaceship and healed by Plies

1553
01:17:48,927 --> 01:17:51,743
I got brought back up

1554
01:17:51,999 --> 01:17:52,511

1555
01:17:53,279 --> 01:17:55,327
Awaken the Earth starseeds

1556
01:17:55,839 --> 01:17:57,375
I would say nothing else matter

1557
01:17:58,399 --> 01:18:04,543
They did also say you don't have other things

1558
01:18:04,799 --> 01:18:06,079
Okay cool I'll respect

1559
01:18:06,335 --> 01:18:11,455
That's a past tense you are

1560
01:18:11,711 --> 01:18:12,223
You are supposed

1561
01:18:12,479 --> 01:18:12,991
To be here

1562
01:18:13,247 --> 01:18:14,015
You have a mission

1563
01:18:14,271 --> 01:18:15,551
Honey doesn't matter anymore

1564
01:18:15,807 --> 01:18:16,575
You have to like

1565
01:18:18,623 --> 01:18:19,135
To be like

1566
01:18:19,903 --> 01:18:22,207
Present himself as a hyper-rational person

1567
01:18:22,463 --> 01:18:23,999
Where is like

1568
01:18:24,255 --> 01:18:25,023
To do

1569
01:18:25,279 --> 01:18:28,351
Sure I had that experience or whatever but

1570
01:18:28,607 --> 01:18:29,631
He goes on to be like

1571
01:18:29,887 --> 01:18:30,399
Look

1572
01:18:30,655 --> 01:18:31,167
Yeah

1573
01:18:31,423 --> 01:18:33,215
I talked to Zoran his parents

1574
01:18:33,471 --> 01:18:36,287
I talked to the mick told me it was my mission to awaken the starseed

1575
01:18:36,799 --> 01:18:38,079
Tell me what that meant

1576
01:18:40,127 --> 01:18:41,151
Give me any help

1577
01:18:42,943 --> 01:18:43,967
Like

1578
01:18:53,695 --> 01:18:57,791
Give you an impossible task will f*** you I'm running honey

1579
01:18:58,047 --> 01:19:01,887
No doubt it is a little bit of a nap

1580
01:19:02,143 --> 01:19:04,191
It is a little bit like

1581
01:19:04,447 --> 01:19:06,751
You're setting the sky up for failure

1582
01:19:07,007 --> 01:19:08,799
But at the same time

1583
01:19:09,567 --> 01:19:10,079
Believe

1584
01:19:10,335 --> 01:19:11,103
Whatever you had

1585
01:19:11,359 --> 01:19:14,431
Experience like the idea that there are out there

1586
01:19:15,199 --> 01:19:18,015
You are super important ever

1587
01:19:18,271 --> 01:19:21,343
I don't believe that the trivial matters of

1588
01:19:21,599 --> 01:19:22,111
I just

1589
01:19:22,367 --> 01:19:24,159
The small to medium-sized business

1590
01:19:24,415 --> 01:19:24,927
Would it be

1591
01:19:25,183 --> 01:19:27,231
Like I don't think that would get in the way of like

1592
01:19:27,487 --> 01:19:30,559
Everything is changed now know that there's more the universe

1593
01:19:30,815 --> 01:19:31,839
Then we think

1594
01:19:35,167 --> 01:19:36,447
Pursue this I don't think it would take

1595
01:19:37,727 --> 01:19:38,495
For you to be like

1596
01:19:39,007 --> 01:19:40,287
Yeah we get back to that mission

1597
01:19:40,543 --> 01:19:46,175
Maybe he's leaving off the second part of the mission was actually I need you to awaken the Stars

1598
01:19:46,431 --> 01:19:48,223
By running a small to mid-sized

1599
01:19:48,735 --> 01:19:51,039
Size starseeds

1600
01:19:51,295 --> 01:19:52,575
Is space

1601
01:19:56,671 --> 01:19:59,743
Pupus this mission

1602
01:20:00,767 --> 01:20:01,791
For a bit

1603
01:20:04,351 --> 01:20:04,863
He has a

1604
01:20:05,119 --> 01:20:05,631
Some voices

1605
01:20:06,143 --> 01:20:06,655
But tell him

1606
01:20:06,911 --> 01:20:07,679
How to pursue

1607
01:20:07,935 --> 01:20:08,447
Admission

1608
01:20:09,215 --> 01:20:10,751
In 2014

1609
01:20:11,263 --> 01:20:13,824
I Heard a Voice saying you have to go to Mount Shasta

1610
01:20:14,336 --> 01:20:14,848
You have to go

1611
01:20:16,384 --> 01:20:16,896
And

1612
01:20:18,688 --> 01:20:19,200
I know

1613
01:20:19,456 --> 01:20:20,224
What to do with it

1614
01:20:22,272 --> 01:20:23,040
My wife

1615
01:20:23,296 --> 01:20:25,088
Came back from surgery you should

1616
01:20:25,344 --> 01:20:25,856
Back surgery

1617
01:20:27,136 --> 01:20:29,696
Call Jojo see smoke in the recovery process

1618
01:20:30,464 --> 01:20:32,000
And selfishly I said to her

1619
01:20:32,768 --> 01:20:33,280
Sorry but

1620
01:20:44,288 --> 01:20:44,800
Hahaha

1621
01:20:45,056 --> 01:20:46,336
You're a shity husband

1622
01:20:46,848 --> 01:20:52,992
Yeah that's a little that is awful by the way

1623
01:20:53,248 --> 01:20:55,552
Never hear a voice that says you got to go

1624
01:20:56,832 --> 01:20:57,856
Yeah I'm positive

1625
01:21:01,696 --> 01:21:02,464
Mecca

1626
01:21:02,976 --> 01:21:03,488
New age

1627
01:21:03,744 --> 01:21:09,888
Serta pseudo-spiritual near.

1628
01:21:10,912 --> 01:21:11,680
CeraVe

1629
01:21:11,936 --> 01:21:14,752
Cult Behavior

1630
01:21:15,520 --> 01:21:17,056
Okay so a

1631
01:21:18,592 --> 01:21:19,104
Convalescing

1632
01:21:19,360 --> 01:21:21,664
We know he has at least one kid

1633
01:21:23,456 --> 01:21:24,992
At this very

1634
01:21:25,504 --> 01:21:26,272
Perry

1635
01:21:26,528 --> 01:21:28,576
Crucial time he's like

1636
01:21:28,832 --> 01:21:30,112
I really don't want to be around

1637
01:21:30,368 --> 01:21:32,928
Don't you guys I don't think

1638
01:21:33,184 --> 01:21:34,208
Is like ever minor

1639
01:21:34,720 --> 01:21:38,560
I mean I guess it probably is a version of a buttocks

1640
01:21:38,816 --> 01:21:39,328
Probably

1641
01:21:39,840 --> 01:21:44,704
Serious

1642
01:21:46,240 --> 01:21:49,056
But really works with burn

1643
01:21:49,312 --> 01:21:53,152
I'm not sure if you said it only works with Burns that's what you did specify

1644
01:21:54,432 --> 01:21:54,944
This fits

1645
01:21:55,200 --> 01:21:56,224
The pattern

1646
01:21:56,480 --> 01:21:58,016
Was that his wife had this surgery

1647
01:21:58,272 --> 01:22:00,064
She needs to heal up you got a kid

1648
01:22:00,320 --> 01:22:02,112
That's a highly stressful.

1649
01:22:02,368 --> 01:22:03,392
What makes sense

1650
01:22:03,648 --> 01:22:06,208
You would also then start experiencing the same

1651
01:22:06,464 --> 01:22:08,512
Symptoms that he had before

1652
01:22:08,768 --> 01:22:10,816
Controllable on integratable

1653
01:22:11,072 --> 01:22:12,352
Versions of the

1654
01:22:12,608 --> 01:22:13,376
Is delusion

1655
01:22:13,632 --> 01:22:14,400
Minit delusion

1656
01:22:14,656 --> 01:22:17,472
Is manifested by a voice saying go to Mount Shasta

1657
01:22:18,240 --> 01:22:19,776
I don't believe for a second

1658
01:22:20,288 --> 01:22:21,568
He doesn't know what Mount Shasta

1659
01:22:25,152 --> 01:22:26,176
Anything about it yeah

1660
01:22:26,432 --> 01:22:29,504
I don't think so this new age

1661
01:22:30,016 --> 01:22:30,528
Alien

1662
01:22:31,552 --> 01:22:37,184
World the voice tells you to go to Mount Shasta

1663
01:22:37,952 --> 01:22:38,976
You got to find it

1664
01:22:39,232 --> 01:22:40,768
So you Google Mount Shasta

1665
01:22:41,280 --> 01:22:43,840
You're not just going to Google Maps Mount Shasta

1666
01:22:44,096 --> 01:22:47,424
You're going to look at one of the websites and it's going to be everything you need

1667
01:22:47,680 --> 01:22:49,728
Probably but I think you probably knew

1668
01:22:49,984 --> 01:22:50,496
Before the

1669
01:22:50,752 --> 01:22:51,520
Supposed voice

1670
01:22:52,288 --> 01:22:53,056
Knowing about it

1671
01:22:53,312 --> 01:22:53,824
Precipitated

1672
01:22:54,080 --> 01:22:57,920
Divorce where I would find the answers

1673
01:22:58,176 --> 01:22:58,944
To the staff

1674
01:23:00,224 --> 01:23:01,248
Carrie gets into it like

1675
01:23:02,016 --> 01:23:02,528
Your

1676
01:23:03,040 --> 01:23:06,624
You're not a person

1677
01:23:07,136 --> 01:23:13,280
You were around when close encounters came out like you were alive when ET came out these sorts of things

1678
01:23:14,560 --> 01:23:15,840
Christian movies

1679
01:23:16,352 --> 01:23:16,864
Which I think is a

1680
01:23:17,120 --> 01:23:18,144
Real

1681
01:23:18,400 --> 01:23:20,192
But also a lot of those ideas

1682
01:23:20,448 --> 01:23:23,264
About like Mount Shasta

1683
01:23:23,520 --> 01:23:29,152
Okay you know like the idea of yeah go to this monolith yeah

1684
01:23:29,664 --> 01:23:30,688
This place were aliens

1685
01:23:30,944 --> 01:23:35,808
Commune

1686
01:23:36,064 --> 01:23:37,600
Before his supposed

1687
01:23:38,112 --> 01:23:40,672
Auditory hallucination in 2014

1688
01:23:41,184 --> 01:23:41,696
So

1689
01:23:42,720 --> 01:23:43,232
Hugo's

1690
01:23:45,024 --> 01:23:45,536
Jesus wife

1691
01:23:46,048 --> 01:23:47,328
She agrees to let him go

1692
01:23:47,584 --> 01:23:53,728
Cheersounds

01:23:54,496 --> 01:23:55,776
But he goes to Mount Shasta

1694
01:24:02,432 --> 01:24:03,456
Whatever

1695
01:24:03,968 --> 01:24:05,504
And there's a lot

1696
01:24:05,760 --> 01:24:06,272
Science

1697
01:24:06,528 --> 01:24:08,320

The Sparks

1703
01:24:19,840 --> 01:24:21,888
Curiosity on the part of Sebastian Martin

01:24:42,112 --> 01:24:43,136
Hematinic stand

1709
01:24:43,904 --> 01:24:47,488
On the mounting on the North side or the South Side of the Mountain

1710
01:24:48,256 --> 01:24:49,280
Why you went up there with you

1711
01:24:49,536 --> 01:24:51,584
Eight-year-old son is dog

1712
01:24:54,656 --> 01:24:57,216
Basically

1713
01:24:58,752 --> 01:25:00,544
And you could not really get into it

1714
01:25:01,056 --> 01:25:02,336
Pizza is so powerful than

1715
01:25:02,848 --> 01:25:04,128
Strange

1716
01:25:07,200 --> 01:25:08,992
Market magazine placements

1717
01:25:09,248 --> 01:25:09,760
Palm tree

1718
01:25:10,272 --> 01:25:11,040
And went back home

1719
01:25:12,576 --> 01:25:13,600
The next day when you went back

1720
01:25:13,856 --> 01:25:14,368
Zune

1721
01:25:16,160 --> 01:25:16,928
The temple was gone

1722
01:25:18,720 --> 01:25:20,768
So I thought it was very interesting in

1723
01:25:22,304 --> 01:25:23,072
I took myself I need

1724
01:25:23,328 --> 01:25:24,352
Contact disorder

1725
01:25:24,864 --> 01:25:25,376
So he tries

1726
01:25:25,888 --> 01:25:27,680
Define the publisher

1727
01:25:27,936 --> 01:25:28,448
Of the book

1728
01:25:28,704 --> 01:25:29,216
Call

1729
01:25:29,984 --> 01:25:30,496
Calls them

1730
01:25:30,752 --> 01:25:31,520
And eat it

1731
01:25:31,776 --> 01:25:33,568
Miraculous

1732
01:25:33,824 --> 01:25:34,336
Coincidence

1733
01:25:34,592 --> 01:25:35,104
Timing

1734
01:25:35,360 --> 01:25:36,384
The person

1735
01:25:37,920 --> 01:25:38,944
Was staying late

1736
01:25:39,200 --> 01:25:42,016
4 hours that day in touch with them

1737
01:25:42,528 --> 01:25:44,064
He tells them I want to talk to

1738
01:25:44,320 --> 01:25:45,344
To the person who wrote This Book

1739
01:25:45,856 --> 01:25:46,880
About Mount Shasta

1740
01:25:47,392 --> 01:25:49,696
What can I do and she's like well

1741
01:25:49,952 --> 01:25:53,792
You send me an email I'll forward it to him if you wants to contact you he will

1742
01:25:54,048 --> 01:25:55,328
So they go through that process

1743
01:25:55,584 --> 01:26:00,960
Five minutes later from the author that was like I'm in the area I'll see you tomorrow morning

1744
01:26:01,472 --> 01:26:03,008
So you together

1745
01:26:03,264 --> 01:26:04,544
So the author is

1746
01:26:04,800 --> 01:26:05,312
Is really big

1747
01:26:06,080 --> 01:26:11,712
We don't know who this author is you don't see the book

1748
01:26:11,968 --> 01:26:15,808
Lot of books about Mount Shasta I have no f****** idea who this dude

1749
01:26:16,320 --> 01:26:17,344
Mighty lonely

1750
01:26:17,600 --> 01:26:23,232
Might also not be real the next morning

1751
01:26:23,488 --> 01:26:24,768
Mount Shasta

1752
01:26:25,792 --> 01:26:30,656
This is an M Night Shyamalan twist

1753
01:26:32,448 --> 01:26:33,472
Introduce myself

1754
01:26:35,264 --> 01:26:36,032
Brisket

1755
01:26:36,288 --> 01:26:36,800
Would I

1756
01:26:37,056 --> 01:26:37,568
What was

1757
01:26:40,128 --> 01:26:40,896
Dokkan battle

1758
01:26:43,968 --> 01:26:44,992
I want to see

1759
01:26:49,088 --> 01:26:50,624
I actually leave at 6

1760
01:26:53,696 --> 01:26:54,464
My dog

1761
01:26:54,976 --> 01:26:56,512
And yes it's with a template in the mouth

1762
01:26:56,768 --> 01:26:58,304
I never received

1763
01:27:01,120 --> 01:27:05,472
Really reading it

1764
01:27:06,240 --> 01:27:08,288
I guess I was hitting a vision of him

1765
01:27:09,824 --> 01:27:10,848
It wasn't in the book

1766
01:27:12,128 --> 01:27:18,272
The whole story wasn't Sebastian

1767
01:27:18,528 --> 01:27:20,576
Temple disappeared

1768
01:27:27,488 --> 01:27:28,256
Go up there

1769
01:27:28,512 --> 01:27:29,536
Can you find your

1770
01:27:30,304 --> 01:27:32,096
And there is truth in them thar Hills

1771
01:27:32,608 --> 01:27:34,144
You go up there but

1772
01:27:34,400 --> 01:27:34,912
Bro

1773
01:27:35,680 --> 01:27:36,448
Don't go to

1774
01:27:36,704 --> 01:27:39,008
To the place where the lamarion temple was

1775
01:27:40,288 --> 01:27:43,360
You don't have no chance

1776
01:27:43,616 --> 01:27:45,152
I don't they don't get into specifics

1777
01:27:45,408 --> 01:27:49,760
He says go to the other side of the mountain

1778
01:27:53,600 --> 01:27:54,112
Is

1779
01:27:54,368 --> 01:27:55,648
Look for the big rock

1780
01:27:57,696 --> 01:27:58,464
Dude

1781
01:27:59,488 --> 01:28:02,816
The f****** mountain is a big rock a******

1782
01:28:03,072 --> 01:28:04,608
It's a kind of advice

1783
01:28:05,120 --> 01:28:07,168
Thank you found something no matter what

1784
01:28:08,448 --> 01:28:09,728
Look for the big rock

1785
01:28:09,984 --> 01:28:10,496
Is like

1786
01:28:11,008 --> 01:28:12,800
That's a guaranteed

1787
01:28:13,056 --> 01:28:15,104
To make it so you don't not find some

1788
01:28:15,872 --> 01:28:16,384
Which is

1789
01:28:19,200 --> 01:28:20,224
He goes up to the mountain

1790
01:28:21,248 --> 01:28:22,016
You find a rock

1791
01:28:23,808 --> 01:28:24,320
That's nice

1792
01:28:24,576 --> 01:28:25,088
Good

1793
01:28:25,856 --> 01:28:27,136
I like the story so far

1794
01:28:27,904 --> 01:28:28,416
Now

1795
01:28:28,672 --> 01:28:29,696
You probably think

1796
01:28:29,952 --> 01:28:30,720
I mean

1797
01:28:31,232 --> 01:28:32,000
One mic

1798
01:28:33,024 --> 01:28:35,072
That this story ends

1799
01:28:35,328 --> 01:28:36,096
With him going

1800
01:28:36,352 --> 01:28:37,376
Finding a rock

1801
01:28:37,632 --> 01:28:41,216
Interfacing with some lamarion and figuring out what

1802
01:28:41,472 --> 01:28:44,288
Going on getting information

1803
01:28:44,800 --> 01:28:46,336
Well I kind of think that this story

1804
01:28:46,592 --> 01:28:48,384
Should end sooner or later but it

1805
01:28:52,224 --> 01:28:57,600
Storiarts to make it look like an a******

1806
01:28:58,368 --> 01:29:01,952
Are you are absolutely right this is

1807
01:29:02,208 --> 01:29:08,352
The most interesting thing I've ever listened to

1808
01:29:10,912 --> 01:29:17,056
Forever is all fascinating

1809
01:29:17,312 --> 01:29:23,200
Hypnotic

1810
01:29:24,224 --> 01:29:25,504
Sorry

1811
01:29:25,760 --> 01:29:28,064
He gets about yesterday find The Rock

1812
01:29:28,320 --> 01:29:30,368
This is where I almost fell asleep

1813
01:29:32,416 --> 01:29:33,440
0

1814
01:29:33,696 --> 01:29:38,048
It is so crazy I don't know why you telling me

1815
01:29:38,304 --> 01:29:39,840
Legitimately

1816
01:29:40,352 --> 01:29:42,400
You could have just been like I went to Mount Shasta

1817
01:29:42,912 --> 01:29:44,704
I saw a rock that's it

1818
01:29:46,496 --> 01:29:48,544
To speculate Maybe

1819
01:29:48,800 --> 01:29:51,104
He saw some aliens in the distance

1820
01:29:51,616 --> 01:29:53,408
Just before I could touch the Rock

1821
01:29:54,176 --> 01:29:56,224
When I go

1822
01:29:58,272 --> 01:29:58,784
About safe

1823
01:29:59,552 --> 01:30:01,600
Acqua di Gio deafening sound like

1824
01:30:03,392 --> 01:30:05,440
Something witty definition

1825
01:30:05,696 --> 01:30:06,976
Going down

1826
01:30:07,232 --> 01:30:11,072
Playing overhead

1827
01:30:11,584 --> 01:30:14,144
I looked around and you know I stopped when that happened

1828
01:30:14,400 --> 01:30:15,424
We f*** with Touch The Rock

1829
01:30:15,936 --> 01:30:17,728
Hoping a something rotten the rounds

1830
01:30:21,056 --> 01:30:22,592
When I touch the Rock

1831
01:30:23,104 --> 01:30:25,408
Damn sexy voice says it's me okay

1832
01:30:25,920 --> 01:30:26,944
You're dumb Google

1833
01:30:29,504 --> 01:30:30,016
Okay

1834
01:30:31,808 --> 01:30:34,880
So earlier in the story as trying to find the Rock

1835
01:30:35,136 --> 01:30:39,232
He finds a rock in a voice booming deep voice

1836
01:30:39,488 --> 01:30:45,632
Not that rock idiot or something like that

1837
01:30:45,888 --> 01:30:46,656
Rock

1838
01:30:48,448 --> 01:30:51,008
You're good

1839
01:30:55,360 --> 01:30:57,152
Sky walked around the Rock

1840
01:31:00,480 --> 01:31:00,992
Bathtub sizes

1841
01:31:01,760 --> 01:31:02,272
What up

1842
01:31:02,784 --> 01:31:03,296
Thalia

1843
01:31:04,064 --> 01:31:05,856
Original point where I started

1844
01:31:06,112 --> 01:31:06,880
What compose The Rock

1845
01:31:07,904 --> 01:31:08,416
And I waited

1846
01:31:09,440 --> 01:31:09,952
Nothing

1847
01:31:10,720 --> 01:31:11,232
So I

1848
01:31:11,488 --> 01:31:12,768
I looked around

1849
01:31:13,024 --> 01:31:16,608
Because that's all the way and even from the talking about ourselves

1850
01:31:17,120 --> 01:31:17,632
It was

1851
01:31:18,144 --> 01:31:19,936
Who sing me becoming more

1852
01:31:22,752 --> 01:31:24,288
Heady

1853
01:31:24,544 --> 01:31:26,848
And so when I looked on the on one of the Peaks

1854
01:31:27,104 --> 01:31:28,128
Onyourhorizon

1855
01:31:28,384 --> 01:31:29,920
And the wind was blowing and everything else

1856
01:31:30,944 --> 01:31:31,456
3

1857
01:31:31,712 --> 01:31:33,504
Flags

1858
01:31:34,528 --> 01:31:35,296
And the world

1859
01:31:35,552 --> 01:31:37,856
Instax Mini

1860
01:31:38,880 --> 01:31:41,184
And

1861
01:31:41,696 --> 01:31:42,720
When I get closer

1862
01:31:45,280 --> 01:31:47,328
Average human

1863
01:31:49,120 --> 01:31:49,888
And

1864
01:31:54,240 --> 01:31:56,032
Looked around cityway anymore beings

1865
01:31:56,288 --> 01:31:56,800
Because again

1866
01:31:57,056 --> 01:31:59,104
What was Luke goddamn macrophilia

1867
01:31:59,360 --> 01:32:01,408
And I'll maybe other things little Kenny from behind

1868
01:32:03,712 --> 01:32:05,248
And I put my keys back on

1869
01:32:06,016 --> 01:32:06,528
And

1870
01:32:06,784 --> 01:32:08,832
The flag salute the robes biscuit were gone

1871
01:32:11,648 --> 01:32:13,440
And so I waited and waste time with you

1872
01:32:13,696 --> 01:32:14,464
Nothing happens

1873
01:32:14,976 --> 01:32:18,304
Had my lunch there late lunch and go back down

1874
01:32:18,816 --> 01:32:19,840
To Manchester

1875
01:32:20,352 --> 01:32:24,448
Dababy push my lunchbox

1876
01:32:24,960 --> 01:32:26,240
As I was packing down

1877
01:32:26,496 --> 01:32:27,008
Cetme

1878
01:32:27,520 --> 01:32:28,800
And by the way never come back

1879
01:32:30,336 --> 01:32:30,848
NFL

1880
01:32:31,360 --> 01:32:37,504
Why you so mean

1881
01:32:41,344 --> 01:32:45,184
I don't know if the rock touching his any

1882
01:32:45,696 --> 01:32:46,208
Historic

1883
01:32:46,464 --> 01:32:48,000
It was The Rock

1884
01:32:48,256 --> 01:32:48,768
That would have

1885
01:32:49,024 --> 01:32:51,072
If it was

1886
01:32:51,328 --> 01:32:56,192
Significado, I just watched the Hobbs and Shaw trailer

1887
01:32:56,448 --> 01:32:56,960
Yesterday

1888
01:32:57,472 --> 01:32:58,240
Fairies

1889
01:32:58,752 --> 01:33:01,824
It's going to be great

1890
01:33:02,080 --> 01:33:06,944
Superhuman powers

1891
01:33:07,200 --> 01:33:07,712
It stinks

1892
01:33:07,968 --> 01:33:11,296
Even for like a Project Camelot story that seems like

1893
01:33:11,808 --> 01:33:13,088
That is so underwhelming

1894
01:33:13,344 --> 01:33:16,672
I want to Mount Shasta I imagine

1895
01:33:16,928 --> 01:33:18,464
Show me the touch of this rock I touch the Rock

1896
01:33:18,720 --> 01:33:21,280
I may have seen a flag in the distance

1897
01:33:21,792 --> 01:33:22,816
Decided it was an alien

1898
01:33:23,328 --> 01:33:24,096
And then

1899
01:33:26,144 --> 01:33:27,424
Everything everything fits

1900
01:33:27,936 --> 01:33:31,520
The patterns of a bartender in the old west

1901
01:33:33,824 --> 01:33:36,896
It's probably just a manifestation of his thoughts

1902
01:33:37,152 --> 01:33:37,664
Look like this was.

1903
01:33:38,432 --> 01:33:39,200
Don't come back here

1904
01:33:46,880 --> 01:33:48,160
I don't get anything out of the store

1905
01:33:48,672 --> 01:33:50,464
The only reason he can afford this is because

1906
01:33:50,720 --> 01:33:51,232
Socialites

1907
01:33:51,488 --> 01:33:53,280
I think that's the real letter

1908
01:33:53,536 --> 01:33:54,816
He could afford it

1909
01:33:55,072 --> 01:33:56,608
Because he didn't have to pay for his wife's

1910
01:33:57,376 --> 01:34:00,448
So this episode

1911
01:34:00,704 --> 01:34:04,032
We just talked about everything

1912
01:34:04,800 --> 01:34:07,104
We got

1913
01:34:07,360 --> 01:34:13,504
Twosome lamarion

1914
01:34:13,760 --> 01:34:18,368
Pleiades

1915
01:34:21,952 --> 01:34:25,536
Wow the reptilians

1916
01:34:29,376 --> 01:34:31,424
Keep track of it but I legitimately could

1917
01:34:31,680 --> 01:34:32,192
You care less

1918
01:34:34,496 --> 01:34:36,544
Oh those are the battle line

1919
01:34:37,312 --> 01:34:41,408
Ku-ku-ku-ku Destroyer

1920
01:34:43,200 --> 01:34:44,224
Destroyed by

1921
01:34:44,480 --> 01:34:45,248
Some sort of natural

1922
01:34:47,808 --> 01:34:48,320
Disagrees

1923
01:34:48,576 --> 01:34:49,600

01:34:49,856 --> 01:34:52,672

1926
01:35:00,352 --> 01:35:03,424
She come into play it's right

1927
01:35:03,936 --> 01:35:10,080
Probably

1928
01:35:10,336 --> 01:35:11,872
Rock

1929
01:35:14,176 --> 01:35:17,248
Yeah way better rock that are boys Sebastian

1930
01:35:17,760 --> 01:35:20,320
Sebastian start speculating about how the allegory of the cave

1931
01:35:20,576 --> 01:35:21,600
Cave in Plato's work

1932
01:35:21,856 --> 01:35:22,368
It was given to him

1933
01:35:24,160 --> 01:35:30,304

1945
01:36:01,792 --> 01:36:03,072

1951
01:36:16,896 --> 01:36:17,920
Yeah those beings

1952
01:36:18,176 --> 01:36:20,736
Just appeared in September of last year

1953
01:36:21,504 --> 01:36:24,064

01:36:28,672 --> 01:36:29,696
Maseca

1956
01:36:29,952 --> 01:36:30,976
Sitting in

1957
01:36:31,488 --> 01:36:32,256
Always had

1958
01:36:36,096 --> 01:36:37,120
I was just

1959
01:36:37,376 --> 01:36:37,888

Post

1962
01:36:49,664 --> 01:36:50,944
And I felt

1963
01:36:51,200 --> 01:36:52,224
Electrical

1964
01:36:52,480 --> 01:36:52,992
Charge

1965
01:36:53,248 --> 01:36:53,760
Braids

1966
01:36:56,576 --> 01:37:00,672
I knew something to send a message to my mother

1967
01:37:01,184 --> 01:37:03,488
And I said how do you communicate with angels

1968
01:37:04,512 --> 01:37:06,560
I don't care about

1969
01:37:08,608 --> 01:37:12,448
I considered a religious person and when my mother so if you need us you was using

1970
01:37:12,960 --> 01:37:15,776
Unlock Android in Android to help patients

1971
01:37:16,288 --> 01:37:17,056
Instead of using the

1972
01:37:17,312 --> 01:37:18,336
Regular Reggie

1973
01:37:18,592 --> 01:37:19,104

1974
01:37:19,360 --> 01:37:20,128

01:37:23,712 --> 01:37:24,992
Ringy-dingy

1976
01:37:26,016 --> 01:37:30,624
And so what I saw myself rotting

1977
01:37:33,440 --> 01:37:37,792
I wasn't sure and I was insisting on it

1978
01:37:38,048 --> 01:37:39,840

1993
01:38:24,384 --> 01:38:27,200
Ageless people at concerts with 100 years old

1994
01:38:27,712 --> 01:38:28,480
20 years old

1995
01:38:28,736 --> 01:38:29,760
It's been great

1996
01:38:30,016 --> 01:38:31,808
But it had become pictures

1997
01:38:32,320 --> 01:38:33,856
And Graceland

1998
01:38:43,840 --> 01:38:48,192
Barry White

1999
01:38:48,448 --> 01:38:49,728
He was the only one with an open book

2000
01:38:50,240 --> 01:38:51,520
Was the others observed

2001
01:38:52,288 --> 01:38:55,104
And I really

2002
01:38:58,432 --> 01:38:58,944
And

2003
01:38:59,968 --> 01:39:03,552
My mother was still on the phone by the way sometime

2004
01:39:03,808 --> 01:39:08,416
Edsel I was on the sofa and he was right there he was right next to

2005
01:39:09,696 --> 01:39:11,232

And we're sexing you know things to do today just didn't hurry up

2008
01:39:26,080 --> 01:39:27,360
And I didn't mention a book to her

2009
01:39:29,408 --> 01:39:30,688
And I dropped my phone

2010
01:39:30,944 --> 01:39:32,736
Place my hands underneath

2011
01:39:32,992 --> 01:39:33,504
The book

2012
01:39:34,016 --> 01:39:34,784

2013
01:39:35,552 --> 01:39:37,088

The man that was there was Michael

2016
01:39:40,928 --> 01:39:42,720

01:39:53,216 --> 01:39:55,776
That's what anybody told me about Darien saying

2022
01:39:56,032 --> 01:39:57,312
They have their own agenda

2023
01:40:00,896 --> 01:40:03,712
What you don't see on them

2024
01:40:04,224 --> 01:40:05,504
The archangels are

2025
01:40:06,016 --> 01:40:07,296
Weary of the

2026
01:40:07,808 --> 01:40:10,624
Jesus not only does he have

2027
01:40:10,880 --> 01:40:12,160
The gift to see beyond

2028
01:40:12,416 --> 01:40:13,184
The veil of death

2029
01:40:16,256 --> 01:40:18,048
Is welcomed by the leader

2030
01:40:18,304 --> 01:40:23,424

01:40:26,240 --> 01:40:28,032
Legit biblical figure

01:40:28,288 --> 01:40:34,432
The Archangel Michael is all the knowledge of space and time

2034
01:40:34,688 --> 01:40:38,016
Omniscient

2035
01:40:38,272 --> 01:40:41,856
Michael Book of Knowledge

2036
01:40:42,112 --> 01:40:43,904
Told him the history of space and time

2037
01:40:44,160 --> 01:40:45,952
He knows everything

2038
01:40:46,208 --> 01:40:52,352
Can astral travel omnipresent

01:40:54,400 --> 01:40:55,936
Is the omnipotent probably not

2041
01:40:56,192 --> 01:40:58,752
Really presenting a picture where he is

2042
01:40:59,008 --> 01:41:00,800
Very close to God

2043
01:41:01,056 --> 01:41:07,200
Is really troubling Z Archangel Michael came to me and said we got a vacancy haha

2044
01:41:07,456 --> 01:41:10,784
Got it out for a bit

2045
01:41:11,040 --> 01:41:12,832
We are you Sebastian

2046
01:41:13,856 --> 01:41:19,744
Noted ass-whole by your own selling overpriced honey

01:41:23,328 --> 01:41:29,472
Even scoff all you want to make Heroes out of vulnerable

2049
01:41:29,984 --> 01:41:31,520
This was last September so

2050
01:41:32,032 --> 01:41:38,176
He's clearly spent a lot with his power in a self-published book

2051
01:41:38,944 --> 01:41:40,224
Andy at this website

2052
01:41:40,736 --> 01:41:41,248
Drake.

2053
01:41:42,528 --> 01:41:43,040
Lightworkers

2054
01:41:43,296 --> 01:41:46,624
Together

2055
01:41:52,256 --> 01:41:57,120
It's interesting that carry isn't real book back at that she's not mad about that even though she loved

2056
01:41:59,680 --> 01:42:01,984
Although

2057
01:42:02,240 --> 01:42:02,752
Completely off

2058
01:42:04,032 --> 01:42:07,360

2059
01:42:07,616 --> 01:42:12,480
So Carrie starts rambling a little bit

2060
01:42:20,160 --> 01:42:24,000
Target.

2061
01:42:24,256 --> 01:42:27,072
Should I invest in

2062
01:42:31,936 --> 01:42:33,216
Atlantis was destroyed by

2063
01:42:33,984 --> 01:42:35,264
Controlled meteor

2064
01:42:41,152 --> 01:42:41,920
Which still exists

2065
01:42:42,176 --> 01:42:48,320
Underwater military

2066
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:57,280
I'm going on at Japan is

2067
01:42:57,536 --> 01:42:58,560
Probably on the side of it

2068
01:42:59,840 --> 01:43:01,376
I don't know I don't know idea

2069
01:43:01,888 --> 01:43:05,472
She doesn't get back to it but he does throw those Turtles of information out

2070
01:43:05,728 --> 01:43:06,752
I was like I don't give a

2071
01:43:07,520 --> 01:43:08,544
So we get to the end

2072
01:43:08,800 --> 01:43:09,312
I'm here

2073
01:43:09,824 --> 01:43:10,848
And this is how they got their energy

2074
01:43:13,920 --> 01:43:14,688
And I think that pee

2075
01:43:14,944 --> 01:43:17,760
People will find Value here and and certainly

2076
01:43:18,528 --> 01:43:20,064
With with your mission

2077
01:43:21,088 --> 01:43:21,600

Want to wake up starseeds certainly we want to wake up Stars

2079
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:34,144
And this.

2080
01:43:34,400 --> 01:43:35,168
All this because

2081
01:43:35,424 --> 01:43:37,216
Well defense industry

2082
01:43:37,728 --> 01:43:39,520
Innovation process

Feel the urgency

2084
01:43:41,568 --> 01:43:43,872
Jordan supposed to change

2085
01:43:46,688 --> 01:43:47,456
Integrating

2086
01:43:48,736 --> 01:43:49,504
Wonderball

2087
01:43:50,016 --> 01:43:50,528
Alright

2088
01:43:51,040 --> 01:43:53,344
Sebastian

2089
01:43:53,600 --> 01:43:54,112
Humanity

2090
01:43:57,184 --> 01:44:00,000
I want to draw Sharp

2091
01:44:00,256 --> 01:44:02,560
Where is the talk about your mission

2092
01:44:02,816 --> 01:44:03,328
Starseeds

2093
01:44:05,120 --> 01:44:07,168
Everything I Can Tell Sebastian is

2094
01:44:07,424 --> 01:44:08,192
The Auntie Jessica

2095
01:44:08,448 --> 01:44:10,496
Khashab is the exact reverse

2096
01:44:12,032 --> 01:44:14,336
Very clear indications from his past

2097
01:44:14,592 --> 01:44:18,176
That he went through some stuff that led him down the path he's on

2098
01:44:18,432 --> 01:44:20,224
Visa Vie believing

2099
01:44:21,504 --> 01:44:24,320
Visions or whatever these clearly embellishing

2100
01:44:24,576 --> 01:44:27,904
He has a family history in the same way Jessica did with her dad

2101
01:44:29,184 --> 01:44:29,696
To this world

2102
01:44:29,952 --> 01:44:30,976
He has a mom who believes

2103
01:44:31,488 --> 01:44:34,304
Heal people with their touch and that you came back from the dead

2104
01:44:34,560 --> 01:44:36,096
The grandma who is convinced

2105
01:44:36,352 --> 01:44:37,120
But she has Vatican

2106
01:44:37,376 --> 01:44:38,656
Certified miracles

2107
01:44:38,912 --> 01:44:40,192
Witness the Virgin Mary

2108
01:44:40,448 --> 01:44:41,984
So they have very similar

2109
01:44:42,496 --> 01:44:43,264
Trajectory

2110
01:44:44,800 --> 01:44:45,312
But the difference is

2111
01:44:45,568 --> 01:44:47,872
He's never going to get off this Trail

2112
01:44:48,384 --> 01:44:49,920
Or at least certainly hasn't yet

2113
01:44:50,432 --> 01:44:54,528
Goat saw through what she was doing and saw how it was harming people

2114
01:44:55,552 --> 01:44:57,344
Sebastian doesn't seem to be all that concerned

2115
01:44:58,112 --> 01:44:59,648
That's kind of a bummer for his grandma

2116
01:45:00,160 --> 01:45:01,696
Cuz she's only had two

2117
01:45:01,952 --> 01:45:03,488
Miracles

2118
01:45:03,744 --> 01:45:05,792
What you got to have three

2119
01:45:06,048 --> 01:45:10,400
She is still by the Pixies

2120
01:45:16,032 --> 01:45:17,568
He has an ever-expanding

2121
01:45:17,824 --> 01:45:20,896
Very grandiose life story

2122
01:45:28,064 --> 01:45:32,416
Inca inconsequential localized things that may or may not happen

2123
01:45:34,464 --> 01:45:37,024
Recruited by Angel

2124
01:45:38,560 --> 01:45:40,864
This is only showing a pattern of escalation

2125
01:45:41,120 --> 01:45:43,680
And it doesn't seem like it's going to get off track

2126
01:45:43,936 --> 01:45:45,472
He is absolutely hurting people

2127
01:45:49,824 --> 01:45:51,616
Shasta

2128
01:45:51,872 --> 01:45:53,152
Helping the people around him

2129
01:45:53,664 --> 01:45:54,944
Brace on his story

2130
01:45:55,200 --> 01:46:01,344
Is blacking out a lot and he starts to see and hear voices

2131
01:46:01,600 --> 01:46:03,648
I would suggest

2132
01:46:04,672 --> 01:46:06,720
Instead of going to see a hypnotherapist

2133
01:46:06,976 --> 01:46:09,024
Meditation

2134
01:46:13,376 --> 01:46:14,912
I don't know

2135
01:46:15,168 --> 01:46:17,728
We can't

2136
01:46:17,984 --> 01:46:23,616
Diagnosed s*** on the podcast or anything like that but there are strong indications

2137
01:46:23,872 --> 01:46:24,896
What we see

2138
01:46:25,152 --> 01:46:26,176
He has a natural path

2139
01:46:26,688 --> 01:46:28,480
There is a explanation

2140
01:46:28,992 --> 01:46:30,272
Meats

2141
01:46:30,784 --> 01:46:31,296
Criteria

2142
01:46:31,552 --> 01:46:32,320
Along the way

2143
01:46:32,576 --> 01:46:35,392
This is just a month

2144
01:46:38,208 --> 01:46:40,000
In the way that someone like Jessica shop

2145
01:46:40,256 --> 01:46:43,072
Down the road

2146
01:46:43,328 --> 01:46:46,400
To present like I'm just trying to wake up children

2147
01:46:51,520 --> 01:46:52,032
This operation

2148
01:46:53,056 --> 01:46:53,568
Roots lightworkers

2149
01:46:55,104 --> 01:46:57,920
As much as I get besides then you can also go f*** himself

2150
01:46:58,432 --> 01:46:59,200
Is lame

2151
01:46:59,968 --> 01:47:00,480
Detox

2152
01:47:03,040 --> 01:47:04,064
You're right on that one

2153
01:47:12,512 --> 01:47:18,656
Website website

2154
01:47:25,312 --> 01:47:28,384
That's right

2155
01:47:30,944 --> 01:47:34,016
Put a f****** alien on a passport

2156
01:47:34,272 --> 01:47:40,416
Do it because I'll tell you what an alien

2157
01:47:40,928 --> 01:47:42,464
Yeah if they are real

2158
01:47:42,720 --> 01:47:46,048
The conception

2159
01:47:46,304 --> 01:47:50,912
Alex Jones only killed one text

2160
01:47:51,168 --> 01:47:56,800
Escalation

2161
01:47:57,056 --> 01:47:59,616
We already

2162
01:48:01,664 --> 01:48:05,248
Galaxy color with huge fan I love your work
