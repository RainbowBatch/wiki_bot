00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:07,232
Incredibly desperate

29
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:12,608
Alex Jones did a very depressing and

30
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:19,008
Ultimately very desperate 34 hour marathon

31
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:21,312
News from what I heard he had the best

32
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:26,176
There's so much to talk about so much to go over so much

33
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:29,504
So I started watching at 11

34
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,064
When the Alex Jones Show

35
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:34,368

36
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:36,160
Fortnite

37
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:37,440
Time

38
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:40,256
I would have done what I 30

39
00:02:40,768 --> 00:02:41,536
4 Hour

40
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:42,560
Marathon

41
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:43,584
I would have stopped

42
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,864
In order

43
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,144
If I look at her

44
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:50,496
Please give us some

45
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:52,800
We talked about recording on Thursday

46
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:58,688
In preparation mode for that and it turned out you were busy

47
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:04,320
I would like endurance challenges

48
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:09,440
So I started at 11 without looking like a little

49
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:15,072
So Alex Jones on right out of the gate it's most

50
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:23,008
Kind of normal I've been being very defensive about the people who are suing him for creating an abusive workplace

51
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:26,080
There's a lot of that

52
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:27,616
I have no doubt

53
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:43,488
You view license but you're not far off

54
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:50,656
I've never heard anyone

55
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:52,448
Look into my eyes

56
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:58,080

I like whoa hold on

60
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:13,952
Technically speaking matrilineal descent

61
00:04:15,232 --> 00:04:17,024
What is why I hate my kids

62
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,303
3 years

63
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:20,607
These anti-semitic critics

64
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:21,887
Sopes

65
00:04:22,143 --> 00:04:22,655

Secretly working for Israel through her or something like that

68
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:33,919
Yeah

69
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:35,199
Totally

70
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:41,599
A member of the Jewish community

71
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:46,207
I'm not entirely sure it's not my business I don't really care

72
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:47,999
Vehemently

73
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:51,327
And now because it serves his purposes he's like

74
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:54,399
Ratatouille that my ex-wife is doing I can't hate them

75
00:04:54,655 --> 00:05:00,543
He has no idea where to go around about this

00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:02,335
Dashiki

77
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:11,039
How do I how do I

78
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:14,111
This next quote is even worse and this is a direct quote

79
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:17,183
She has a noble nose but she's not Jewish

80
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:27,935
That is a very interested

81
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:36,639
Fruition

82
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:37,407
Alright

83
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:38,431
She is

84
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:40,223
From the Acropolis

85
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:41,759
Knoxville

86
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:43,295
Propolis where the Jews

87
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:47,647
Weird

88
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:50,463
And then Alex brings in his first guest

89
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:52,767
And it's that assignment Roche

90
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:57,119
The sweet slander from South Africa

91
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:12,479
At one point Alex is like the

92
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:18,879
Leave like why don't you just go and let the blacks kill each other

93
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:25,023
He was on the show

94
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:28,351
Barbarism

95
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:32,959
What

96
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:34,495
Is going here

97
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:37,311
So he receives to have like a couple of

98
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:38,591
A couple more

00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:44,223
I don't even remember who they are

101
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:45,503
The the

102
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:51,903
The fake Twitter where all the white supremacist going to get kicked off Twitter

103
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:54,975
Comes in

104
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:57,023
The shop

105
00:06:57,279 --> 00:06:57,791
Wicked

106
00:06:58,047 --> 00:06:59,071
We get to the war room

107
00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:02,655
A giant 28 might as well have been a giant pile of cocaine

108
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:05,215
We get to the war room

109
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:06,495
With Owen Shroyer

110
00:07:07,775 --> 00:07:09,567

Into the proceedings

112
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:14,175

Indian guy on who's running for office

114
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:21,343
He's trying to take Elizabeth Warren

115
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:29,279
It's pretty uncomfortable because they keep saying only a real Indian can be two-faced

116
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:31,327
A very very

117
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:39,263
Play that like it'll really appeal to some part of

118
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:41,055
The base

119
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,175
So that interview

120
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:49,503
Actually think beyond the racism that guy was kind of making

121
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:50,527
Couple good points

122
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:51,551
About

123
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:54,879

Of course I am

151
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:05,791
His appearance was anything too awful either at side of like

152
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:07,327
I just disagree with stuffy saying

153
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:13,727
But I looked into any rights for a publication or I've come to find out now he owns this publication

154
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:22,943
Their slogan includes

155
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:28,831

00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:54,687
Decided not to engage cuz I don't really have anything

Again I really have any skin in the game outside of like

162

I tried to take that was a puff PC feels like it wasn't

I know he has Jerome corsi coming at some point with me

175
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:34,367
But I just kept referring to him as the boring intern

176
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:36,671
Because he's a young guy and you just

177
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:39,231

I've sewed like I was just sitting there like I am

194
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:16,095
I'm having

195
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:17,631
Rubble

196
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:21,471
Like not even staying awake cuz it's still before 8

197
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:22,751
Yam

198
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:25,055
I don't know I'm a bit off more than I can

199
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:27,871
Then

200
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:28,639
Alex Jones

201
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:35,295
All right you get a breath of fresh air

202
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:36,319
About

203
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:38,367
But just to give a little bit more

204
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:39,135
Contact

205
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:39,903
Text what happened

206
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:41,439
After Alex Jones finish

207
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:42,719
It's another f****** boring

208
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:44,255
And I watch

209
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:46,303
I've been drinking

210
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:50,399
Little bit along the way

211
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:51,679
About for a sec

212
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:55,519
Slam dunk videos

213
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:57,567
For a couple hours is what

214
00:11:57,823 --> 00:12:03,967
Don't

215
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:07,039
A lot of lot of metaphors

216
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:12,671
Undercurrent

217
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:14,719
Yep.

218
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:15,487
When I come back

219
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:18,303
Boring intern

220
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:19,071
Bruises

221
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:20,863
Running another 3-hour ship

222
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:23,167
I remember his name

223
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:23,935
Smith

224
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:27,263
Well he's also

225
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:28,287
Who found those

226
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:30,335
FIFA contract on 4chan

227
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:38,527
Sign contract

228
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:41,599
Any member of antique immediately

229
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:43,135
Tucson

230
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:44,159
Yes that hoax

231
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:46,975
Great

232
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:48,255
I'm really bored

233
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:49,279
I'm really bored

234
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:50,815
I need I'm flagging

235
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:54,655
And then it becomes too late for Infowars to broadcast

236
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:55,423
Anymore

237
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:56,959
And so they go to the London office

238
00:12:59,007 --> 00:12:59,775
It's probably about like

239
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:05,407
In the morning here to go to London because they're on Greenwich Mean Time

240
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:07,711
Until you got Paul Joseph Watson

241
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:08,991
And Tommy Robinson

242
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:10,271
We're going to be brought

243
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:12,575
Sing from London while everyone else in Austin

244
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:13,855
Takes a nap

245
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:15,903
And so Tommy Robinson

246
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:16,927
Is just

247
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:17,951
Howling

248
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:19,487
Apocryphal stories

249
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:20,767
About Muslim violence

250
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:22,815
I had no likes like

251
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:24,607
Citations for any openings

252
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:28,447
Eric

253
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:29,983
I like this

254
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:36,383
I like that broadcast

255
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:41,247
The old-time Grandpa tell stories level terrible

256
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:43,295
And like I'm watching the viewer

257
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:45,343
On like I was on the Infowars

258
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:46,111
Maine live

259
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:47,647
Stringent

260
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:48,927
300 people watch

261
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:49,951
Or something like that

262
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:51,487
I have to assume

263
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:55,583
He knows those numbers you can stick it in his performance was just like

264
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:01,215
Cuz he gets done

265
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:05,567
Then comes on I like turkey

266
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:07,103
For however long he's on

267
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:09,151
Then get to David Knight

268
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:11,455
Advanta maybe get another

269
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:12,735
3 hours of Alex

270
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:16,831
No I gave up at 6 a.m.

271
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:18,111
Paul Joseph Watson

272
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:19,135
Sunset these words

273
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:22,719
The Sargon of asgaard

274
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:24,767
What

275
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:25,791
I'm out

276
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:28,607
That's the only time I would have started listening

277
00:14:28,863 --> 00:14:35,007
National

278
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:40,639
With these guys

279
00:14:40,895 --> 00:14:41,663
I know what they say

280
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:43,967
You say

281
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:47,039
Okay I'm not

282
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:48,319
Sure why his

283
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:49,087
Like

284
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:53,951
Maybe he just had a YouTube channel that people like and that's the beginning of it I don't know

285
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:55,487
I don't care about his history

286
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:03,423
With somebody who thinks he is the cousin of

287
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:04,959
Thor

288
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:10,079
Card or something

289
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:14,943
I turned it off I went to bed

290
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:18,015
Guilty about it

291
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:20,831
Yes

292
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:26,463
Guilt is the feeling that you should have been experiencing that moment

293
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:27,487
Half hour nap

294
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:30,559
Then come back

295
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:33,119
And I didn't wake up until like 11

296
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:37,215
We're all good and everything was fine

297
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:40,031
World world

298
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:42,591
It turns out you could have not listened to any of it

299
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:45,407
It was worth

300
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:46,175
Anyting

301
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:47,711
Was that second

302
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:49,759
Swing shift from Alex Jones

303
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:51,551
Listening to right now

304
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:55,391
I want to give a shout out to my friend

305
00:15:55,647 --> 00:16:01,791
He was riding shotgun with me and chatting over Facebook

306
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:05,631
For some portion of it he started trolling the Infowars chat room

307
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:10,239
About that a little bit

308
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:11,519
We learned a lot

309
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:13,823
I learned I learned a great deal about

310
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:14,847
Being forward

311
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:19,199
Text from

312
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:26,879
I'm exhausted because I feel so good

313
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:29,951
Alright

314
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:36,351
You might detect a little bit of booze on his breath

315
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:39,679
I'm exhausted cuz I feel so good

316
00:16:39,935 --> 00:16:45,055
He kept getting callers or like you can see how tired you are

317
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:48,895
He is quite drunk

318
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:50,943
Which course

319
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:52,479
Alex's experience

320
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:53,503
Some exhaust

321
00:16:56,831 --> 00:16:57,343
Exhaust

322
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:58,367
Repeat stroke

323
00:16:58,623 --> 00:17:02,975
Yeah I know we start off our adventure with Alex

324
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:05,791
In this first clip he is just talk

325
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:06,815
2

326
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:08,095
Larry Pratt

327
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:13,727
Who's the guy who runs the organization called the gunownersofamerica which we would look at as a

328
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:15,519
Extreme NRA

329
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:17,055
That's not good

330
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:19,359
No it's not the Gun Owners of America

331
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:22,943
Because he's

332
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:23,967
There's nothing really in

333
00:17:24,223 --> 00:17:24,991
Everything happens and Alex

334
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:26,015
Keeping it together

335
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:27,295
Cuz Larry pride is respect

336
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:28,063
Old man

337
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:31,135
He's got about his best behavior but

338
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:31,903
Once he leaves

339
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:38,559
Larry Pratt interview

340
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:40,607
Creating straw ban version

341
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:41,631
Of the accusation

342
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:44,703
Scott said on the other

343
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:51,615
EEOC complaints filed against m in thousands of newspapers today

344
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:53,919
They say I

345
00:17:57,759 --> 00:17:59,807
In a video we were shooting on a computer

346
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:04,927
This is how crazy they are

347
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:07,743
President

348
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:10,047
Prices of a Nazi with no proof

349
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:12,351
That's why I'm telling you the lister's

350
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:15,935
There's a shoot that's that's supposed to climb out there

351
00:18:16,959 --> 00:18:22,079
I'm asking you the lizard understand that I'm not complaining at you I'm not asking for more from you

352
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:23,871
I'm saying you

353
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:25,663
You're the reason we're here

354
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:27,967
You're the Reason we've had success

355
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:31,295
You're the reason we are defending all of your frames

356
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:35,903
So give us a credit

357
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:38,975
Got them financially support Infowars today

358
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:43,327
24-hour broadcast to point that out

359
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:49,215
Give me the flavor of almost all of the night

360
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:55,615
Is just him

361
00:18:55,871 --> 00:18:57,919
Episode as one of our lives

362
00:18:58,431 --> 00:18:59,711
Art listeners would die

363
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:00,735
Cuz of the iPad

364
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:03,295
Yeah everytime there's an app

365
00:19:03,551 --> 00:19:04,063
Do with this wood

366
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:05,087
Be not good

367
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:10,207
I want to get nobody said he was grooming men for gay sex

368
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:17,119
Sex in a plane

369
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:23,007
Is that Alex was grooming man for gay sex

370
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:26,079
Because I had that I have both of their legal complaints

371
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:30,687
It's here in front of me I actually do know that he hugged

372
00:19:30,943 --> 00:19:31,967
Ashley Beckford

373
00:19:33,759 --> 00:19:37,855
Wait

374
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:42,463
That's right under the pretenses of the heart

375
00:19:42,719 --> 00:19:43,231
Complained

376
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:44,511
Because I don't want

377
00:19:45,023 --> 00:19:46,303
And I don't want there to be any bones

378
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:48,607
About this I don't want it to be like Alex

379
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:50,143
Cuz fake version of accusation

380
00:19:54,239 --> 00:19:58,079
In 2014 the CEO of the company allowed his friend Shane Steiner into my office

381
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:01,663
Computer with images of gay

382
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:06,015
Twinkle light

383
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:06,783
Bodybuilder

384
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:10,623
And I don't know if that is right or if Rob Jacob

385
00:20:11,135 --> 00:20:12,927
Explain that it was actually a pornography

386
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:14,975
So leave that aside for a second

387
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:21,375
2014 CO2 company Alex Jones Jones allowed at my office

388
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:23,935
To display on my computer images of gay pornography

389
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:28,287
I believe this action was a continuation of the intimidation and sexual harassment

390
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:32,639
That he was grooming me for homosexual sex

391
00:20:33,151 --> 00:20:34,431
I made a formal complaint to

392
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:35,199
To the human resource

393
00:20:35,455 --> 00:20:35,967
Department

394
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:37,247
So that complaint

395
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:39,039
Should be on their files

396
00:20:39,295 --> 00:20:39,807
Unless

397
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:41,343
They have

398
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:42,367
Sensitive

399
00:20:42,623 --> 00:20:43,135
Deleted them

400
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:43,903
He

401
00:20:44,415 --> 00:20:45,695
He also makes this claim cuz he says

402
00:20:46,463 --> 00:20:46,975
Continuation

403
00:20:47,743 --> 00:20:50,303
From the years 2008 to 2012

404
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:52,351
The CEO of the company called me beef

405
00:20:52,863 --> 00:20:54,143
Referring to male pornstars

406
00:20:55,423 --> 00:20:56,447
Intimidating and harassing

407
00:20:56,703 --> 00:20:57,727
And a form of sexual harassment

408
00:20:58,239 --> 00:20:59,007
And he was grooming me

409
00:20:59,263 --> 00:21:00,031
A homosexual sex

410
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:02,079
So that claim is being made

411
00:21:05,151 --> 00:21:07,455
This side this idea that

412
00:21:07,711 --> 00:21:08,735
He may have

413
00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:13,087
It might have been a bodybuilder

414
00:21:13,343 --> 00:21:14,623
Intimidating

415
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:17,952
Addressing the actual issue at hand

416
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:20,256
He's creating a fake version of it to respond to

417
00:21:23,584 --> 00:21:25,888
Houses

418
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,168
Erased

419
00:21:27,424 --> 00:21:30,240
Align perfectly with what I know of

420
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:33,568
Cuz I don't want to read like four paragraphs

421
00:21:33,824 --> 00:21:37,152
She was sent out when she get first just started

422
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:40,224
The cover a democratic

423
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,016
Party for the first presidential debate

424
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:51,744
Not used to it

425
00:21:53,536 --> 00:21:54,816
Infowars for Gears

426
00:21:55,072 --> 00:21:56,352
Compared compared to my lesson

427
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:57,376
Three months

428
00:21:57,632 --> 00:21:59,936
Consistently pressured me to engage with the Hillary Clinton

429
00:22:00,192 --> 00:22:00,960
Supporters as a black

430
00:22:01,472 --> 00:22:01,984
Trump supporter

431
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,264
I was subsequently

432
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:07,872
Subject to multiple people hurling insults and racial slurs at me including Uncle Tom

433
00:22:08,128 --> 00:22:09,408
By one of the gay white male

434
00:22:10,432 --> 00:22:14,528
Another Clinton supporter a white lesbian woman told me that she knew more about black issues than I did

435
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:17,344
Because she's married to a black woman who is also Prime

436
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:20,416
So this is all captured on video now

437
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:21,440
Just at that night

438
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:24,000
Not be uploaded to YouTube channel

439
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:25,280
Because of the interact

440
00:22:25,536 --> 00:22:27,840
Newsworthy and had no political value

441
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:29,376
Rob Dewey

442
00:22:29,632 --> 00:22:34,752
At lady

443
00:22:35,008 --> 00:22:36,800
It to exploit the racial attack on me

444
00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:37,568
Play for Infowars

445
00:22:37,824 --> 00:22:39,104
Prophet

446
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:41,920
The existence of these clips is still hurting my professional reputation

447
00:22:42,176 --> 00:22:42,688
Mutation is a journey

448
00:22:44,992 --> 00:22:47,552
Chloe working at Ward

449
00:22:47,808 --> 00:22:49,088
It's Dave still behave

450
00:22:49,344 --> 00:22:54,208
Horribly bad for her

451
00:22:55,744 --> 00:22:58,816
You should not work at Infowars if you want credibility

452
00:22:59,072 --> 00:23:00,096
It's not going to work

453
00:23:00,864 --> 00:23:03,168
So she she says I went back to the Infowars office

454
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:03,936
Tears

455
00:23:04,192 --> 00:23:07,776
Incredulous at how I was being racially attacked because of my support for a political

456
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:09,312
And Alex Jones

457
00:23:11,872 --> 00:23:14,688
Force me to share what it happened to me on air for YouTube

458
00:23:14,944 --> 00:23:16,480
Another social media that same night

459
00:23:16,992 --> 00:23:18,272
Feigning his own tears of M

460
00:23:19,296 --> 00:23:23,648
Answer the broadcast I was with Alex Jones robbed in several other staff members and Rob dues office

461
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,184
I was talking about

462
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,720
How I didn't agree with the white one

463
00:23:26,976 --> 00:23:28,000
Said that she knows

464
00:23:28,256 --> 00:23:28,768
About black

465
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,560
Community board than I do

466
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:31,584
Because she has a black wife

467
00:23:32,352 --> 00:23:33,632
Alex Jones was still pretending

468
00:23:33,888 --> 00:23:35,936
Feel sympathy for my plate is a black female Trump

469
00:23:36,192 --> 00:23:39,264
Supporter and he put his arm around my shoulder to initiate a side hug

470
00:23:39,776 --> 00:23:41,312
After he pulled me into his side

471
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,616
Instead of removing his arm from my shoulder

472
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:45,664
He allowed his arm to slide down my back

473
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,456
He grabbed my butt with his right hand

474
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:50,784
Simultaneously use commenting to those in the room quote

475
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,576
Who wouldn't wanna have a black wife

476
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:53,856
In response to

477
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,160
I felt embarrassed in Derby

478
00:23:56,672 --> 00:23:59,232
Pacifically touch my behind at that moment is

479
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:00,256
Come on

480
00:24:00,512 --> 00:24:02,560
That other people might not notice

481
00:24:03,584 --> 00:24:05,376
So she goes on

482
00:24:05,632 --> 00:24:06,144
Not

483
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,680
A good way to react

484
00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:09,472
No situation

485
00:24:09,728 --> 00:24:12,288
Of all the things to hear

486
00:24:13,056 --> 00:24:14,848
When Ashley is talking about that and

487
00:24:15,104 --> 00:24:19,968
He's like that's no good

488
00:24:28,928 --> 00:24:30,720
In the office as usual

489
00:24:31,488 --> 00:24:33,536
Alex

490
00:24:33,792 --> 00:24:36,608
Come to find out quote what I like to do for fun outside of work

491
00:24:36,864 --> 00:24:38,144
It's my opinion that it wasn't

492
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:38,912
Is intention

493
00:24:39,168 --> 00:24:41,216
To see if you could groom me for sexual exploitation

494
00:24:41,728 --> 00:24:45,824
Because he also mentioned that I had a quote good body that look like I worked out a lot

495
00:24:46,336 --> 00:24:48,384
I was concerned that these unwanted sexual

496
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:51,200
This would eventually result in a request for sexual favors

497
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:52,224
In exchange for promotion

498
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:54,272
In the office it was rumored that

499
00:24:54,528 --> 00:24:55,808
He may have had inappropriate

500
00:24:56,064 --> 00:24:57,344
Some chips with other female production

501
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,112
Instaff employees

502
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,696
In addition Alex Jones himself has alluded to the fact that he loves

503
00:25:01,952 --> 00:25:02,976
Worcester grab women's backside

504
00:25:03,488 --> 00:25:05,280
A videos of

505
00:25:06,048 --> 00:25:06,816
And that's fair

506
00:25:07,328 --> 00:25:09,888
I come to about all this

507
00:25:10,144 --> 00:25:10,656
Is like

508
00:25:11,168 --> 00:25:13,472
I take these allegations

509
00:25:13,728 --> 00:25:16,800
I believe her as much as I believe anybody who makes

510
00:25:17,056 --> 00:25:19,616
Claims and it certainly waiting line without

511
00:25:20,128 --> 00:25:23,456
Public behavior and what we know about you

512
00:25:23,712 --> 00:25:24,224
I think

513
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,016
If I had $100

514
00:25:26,272 --> 00:25:30,368
$7 on shoes

515
00:25:30,624 --> 00:25:32,416
And $3 on she's wrong

516
00:25:33,184 --> 00:25:35,488
But even then that $3 is like

517
00:25:36,256 --> 00:25:36,768
18

518
00:25:37,024 --> 00:25:39,840
Penny's I don't want that $3 back

519
00:25:40,096 --> 00:25:44,192
Because the odds are so high

520
00:25:44,448 --> 00:25:50,592
Set Alex's where all your money back

521
00:25:50,848 --> 00:25:53,664
Money if the $3 is right but

522
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,760
Some of them will get you in a minute

523
00:25:58,016 --> 00:25:59,296
I really want to

524
00:25:59,552 --> 00:26:01,344
Make very clear is that

525
00:26:01,856 --> 00:26:03,392
I'm making a judgment

526
00:26:03,648 --> 00:26:04,928
In the court of public opinion

527
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:06,976
Think her

528
00:26:07,744 --> 00:26:09,024
Claims sound credible

529
00:26:09,536 --> 00:26:12,096
Based on

530
00:26:12,608 --> 00:26:14,656
Things other people have claimed in the past

531
00:26:15,168 --> 00:26:16,448
What his ex-wife says

532
00:26:17,984 --> 00:26:20,032
The fact that all of his responses are

533
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:21,824
Strawman versions of the accusation

534
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,640
Actually dealing with the

535
00:26:24,896 --> 00:26:26,944
I'm accused of grabbing her but you like

536
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,736
I touched her back

537
00:26:28,992 --> 00:26:31,040
You know me memes

538
00:26:31,296 --> 00:26:32,832
You're defending yourself a gum

539
00:26:33,088 --> 00:26:34,112
Against the false charge

540
00:26:34,368 --> 00:26:39,232
Probably

541
00:26:39,488 --> 00:26:40,768
Hey I remember what nights

542
00:26:41,024 --> 00:26:43,840
She's talking about situation

543
00:26:44,096 --> 00:26:47,680
I felt that this was what was going on and she felt that this was what was going on

544
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:49,984
Story that's a conversation

545
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,032
Subway

546
00:27:01,248 --> 00:27:04,320
I don't know I believe that it's up to court

547
00:27:04,576 --> 00:27:05,856
To decide

548
00:27:06,368 --> 00:27:09,184
A complaint has been made and hopefully the process goes as it should

549
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,464
At this point

550
00:27:10,976 --> 00:27:12,000
Can't believe it

551
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:13,536
But I also know that your

552
00:27:13,792 --> 00:27:15,072
You're innocent until proven guilty

553
00:27:16,608 --> 00:27:17,120
Alex

554
00:27:18,144 --> 00:27:19,168
Is doing a bad job.

555
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:25,824
Publicly

556
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,640
How this goes in the future

557
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:37,344
I Will Never Surrender I will never and I will have settled that lawsuit with Ashley 41

558
00:27:43,232 --> 00:27:46,048
Also I mean really need to come

559
00:27:46,816 --> 00:27:49,120
These claims were filed

560
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:51,168
At the beginning of February or lights

561
00:27:51,424 --> 00:27:52,704
The second week of February

562
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:58,592
Coming

563
00:27:58,848 --> 00:28:01,152
Course that's the only reason he's doing this

564
00:28:01,408 --> 00:28:05,248
That's why he did one in April last year

565
00:28:07,552 --> 00:28:13,184
Either one in November I'm not entirely sure why you did that one end of the fiscal year

566
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,464
I could have not accept

567
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:17,024
Chamber 2000

568
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:19,072
15 because of his

569
00:28:19,328 --> 00:28:24,704
Divorce because

570
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:27,008
Eonline

571
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,336
That's why you doing

572
00:28:30,848 --> 00:28:33,152
If you getting sued by two former employees

573
00:28:33,408 --> 00:28:34,688
He probably knows

574
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:38,272
There's a decent chance some other employees are going to come out of the woodwork

575
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:40,320
We can only hope

576
00:28:40,576 --> 00:28:43,904
I don't know. Some people be like

577
00:28:44,416 --> 00:28:44,928
Yeah B

578
00:28:45,184 --> 00:28:46,720
This isn't covered in my MBA

579
00:28:46,976 --> 00:28:49,536
Or something like that you know

580
00:28:51,328 --> 00:28:57,472
Converse still not protected

581
00:28:57,984 --> 00:29:02,592
With the same spirit that I am approaching this we'll see what happens

582
00:29:03,104 --> 00:29:06,944
We'll see what happens

583
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:10,528
34 hour marathon

584
00:29:12,064 --> 00:29:12,832
Let's get to it

585
00:29:13,088 --> 00:29:14,112
What's the best move forward

586
00:29:14,368 --> 00:29:18,464
Just because Alex Jones burps in the middle of the worst Nigeria

587
00:29:19,488 --> 00:29:21,024
Forsyth

588
00:29:22,048 --> 00:29:23,840
Christian fighting radical Islam

589
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:26,400
Antenna or tonight

590
00:29:29,728 --> 00:29:30,496
Jerriann

591
00:29:30,752 --> 00:29:32,544
You're a lot of media hype a lot of stuff

592
00:29:33,056 --> 00:29:34,080
Delivered

593
00:29:35,616 --> 00:29:37,920
Everybody watching

594
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:45,344
Realize when you go buy a book or video or some supplements are water filtration are you will make a $10 donation

595
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:48,672
That's how we built this this was not easy to build

596
00:29:51,488 --> 00:29:53,024
Copper plating

597
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:54,816
Here we want sweetheart

598
00:29:57,632 --> 00:29:58,912
I'm a victim

599
00:30:00,448 --> 00:30:01,984
But I'm not complaining

600
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,288
So are also

601
00:30:04,544 --> 00:30:06,336
If you are going to reference

602
00:30:06,592 --> 00:30:07,104
That's good Chris

603
00:30:07,616 --> 00:30:10,944
Do not talk about the ones in Kenya and Nigeria

604
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,736
AR

605
00:30:12,992 --> 00:30:19,136
The worse they are the worst

606
00:30:19,392 --> 00:30:21,184
Admittedly

607
00:30:21,696 --> 00:30:26,304
Raping lesbian women all over the place because they're too gay and God wants them to

608
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:28,352
Those are the ones that I want

609
00:30:28,608 --> 00:30:29,376
Dimension

610
00:30:29,632 --> 00:30:30,400
When I'm talking about

611
00:30:30,656 --> 00:30:31,168
People fighting

612
00:30:31,424 --> 00:30:32,192
For freedom

613
00:30:32,448 --> 00:30:33,728
Big shout out

614
00:30:33,984 --> 00:30:34,496
Great dude

615
00:30:37,056 --> 00:30:38,080
To this Marathon

616
00:30:38,592 --> 00:30:40,128
Is Alex Jones knows he's being sued

617
00:30:40,384 --> 00:30:42,688
Yeah but what he could never have expected

618
00:30:42,944 --> 00:30:45,248
Is also the day before

619
00:30:45,504 --> 00:30:49,856
Donald Trump would come out and say I want to take people's guns

620
00:30:51,648 --> 00:30:53,952
Real trouble place

621
00:30:54,464 --> 00:30:54,976
So

622
00:30:55,232 --> 00:30:55,744
It doesn't

623
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,304
Affect his main broadcast that much

624
00:31:00,096 --> 00:31:02,144
Literally watching Macbeth

625
00:31:04,448 --> 00:31:05,728
This is exactly

626
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:12,384
Line by line was he visited by three witches

627
00:31:12,896 --> 00:31:15,200
Division of storage place

628
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:17,760
So

629
00:31:18,016 --> 00:31:18,784
Dino Alex

630
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:21,856
Struggling with his maybe turning on them

631
00:31:23,904 --> 00:31:24,672
Turn on

632
00:31:25,184 --> 00:31:25,952
So in this

633
00:31:26,464 --> 00:31:27,232
Evening shift

634
00:31:27,488 --> 00:31:29,280
Adidas

635
00:31:29,536 --> 00:31:30,304
Right right

636
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:32,864
In the evening shift he's got to find a way

637
00:31:33,376 --> 00:31:34,656
He spent most of the day trying to

638
00:31:34,912 --> 00:31:35,424
Figure out

639
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:36,192
Suspenders

640
00:31:38,752 --> 00:31:40,800
And like as usual he came up with

641
00:31:41,312 --> 00:31:41,824
Great ideas

642
00:31:43,872 --> 00:31:44,384
No

643
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:48,224
I think he doesn't figure it out until maybe like

644
00:31:48,736 --> 00:31:49,504
I don't know

645
00:31:50,272 --> 00:31:51,040
Half an hour

646
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,904
Real f*****-up thing that he said about Trump

647
00:31:56,672 --> 00:31:58,464
I want to go ahead the air again

648
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,000
Dianne Feinstein

649
00:32:00,768 --> 00:32:04,096
Winthrop and fuel each other close to get 45 emoji

650
00:32:06,656 --> 00:32:08,192
Just because he's better than Hillary

651
00:32:09,472 --> 00:32:13,056
Understand we were told our sources last week that he's being turned

652
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:15,104
Blackmail

653
00:32:16,128 --> 00:32:17,920
Biceps operatives in the White House

654
00:32:18,688 --> 00:32:22,784
We didn't put that out.

655
00:32:23,552 --> 00:32:24,320
Now

656
00:32:24,576 --> 00:32:26,112
We got no pics leaving today

657
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:35,584
Melania Trump and Stormy Daniels just looks like it's time to wash your succulent

658
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:36,608
Gorgeous female

659
00:32:37,888 --> 00:32:38,400
She's in there

660
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:43,776
Yes the word is that's been going on

661
00:32:44,288 --> 00:32:46,336
Sideways

662
00:32:46,592 --> 00:32:48,640
I want to thank this is Art of the deal stuff but

663
00:32:48,896 --> 00:32:51,200
I got to be honest with you cuz that's all that matters

664
00:32:51,456 --> 00:32:54,016
Trump starting a magazine job I was right to endorsing

665
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:57,600
Warriors

666
00:32:59,648 --> 00:33:00,672
Aluminum in trouble

667
00:33:01,696 --> 00:33:02,208
But

668
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:07,072
I had torches off Erin on Airway segoe Sandeep

669
00:33:08,608 --> 00:33:09,632
Text eoin

670
00:33:09,888 --> 00:33:14,240
14

671
00:33:14,752 --> 00:33:18,080
I just didn't touch it

672
00:33:29,088 --> 00:33:32,160
That is best friend feels like that is why

673
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:49,312
She looks little thinner

674
00:33:49,568 --> 00:33:50,080
Stipend

675
00:33:56,736 --> 00:33:58,272
Just that quote

676
00:33:58,528 --> 00:33:59,296
Look straight up

677
00:33:59,552 --> 00:34:01,088
She's a luscious succulent

678
00:34:01,344 --> 00:34:04,416
Beautiful woman

679
00:34:04,672 --> 00:34:08,000
I just wanted to add my name

680
00:34:08,256 --> 00:34:09,024
Jesus Christ

681
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,048
Succulents

682
00:34:10,304 --> 00:34:12,096
Succulent

683
00:34:13,888 --> 00:34:20,032
Also I tweeted out that quote and Ashley Beckford

684
00:34:20,288 --> 00:34:22,336
I have a lot of Correction with

685
00:34:22,592 --> 00:34:23,104
Infowars

686
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:27,200
Adjacent personalities

687
00:34:29,504 --> 00:34:32,064
Oh boy

688
00:34:33,344 --> 00:34:34,880
This is so pathetic

689
00:34:35,136 --> 00:34:37,696
Because

690
00:34:37,952 --> 00:34:40,000
Never do any of that stuff

691
00:34:40,256 --> 00:34:42,816
Do all those women accusing him of

692
00:34:43,072 --> 00:34:45,376
They're crazy they're out of that.

693
00:34:45,632 --> 00:34:47,680
The Russian P story

694
00:34:47,936 --> 00:34:51,520
That's all

695
00:34:51,776 --> 00:34:53,568
He's Beyond reproach

696
00:34:53,824 --> 00:34:55,360
Beyond is the most

697
00:34:55,616 --> 00:34:57,152
Moral man is

698
00:34:58,688 --> 00:34:59,200
Sure

699
00:34:59,712 --> 00:35:04,320
We heard that he's f****** hopex and that's why she resigned and we can never trust him again because of it

700
00:35:04,576 --> 00:35:06,112
That all that other Russian stuff

701
00:35:06,368 --> 00:35:07,136
Still crazy

702
00:35:07,392 --> 00:35:09,952
Yes he's f****** hopex all the time

703
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:14,304
David was God

704
00:35:14,816 --> 00:35:16,864
Or whatever

705
00:35:24,544 --> 00:35:26,080
Brought up King David music

706
00:35:26,592 --> 00:35:27,104
That's right religion

707
00:35:28,896 --> 00:35:30,688
Joe talked about you got to throw some of that

708
00:35:31,968 --> 00:35:32,480
Goldsboro little bit

709
00:35:36,832 --> 00:35:38,112
Trump at Ali's wives

710
00:35:38,368 --> 00:35:39,392
We didn't say suddenly

711
00:35:40,672 --> 00:35:44,768
Evangelicals just want somebody that will leave

712
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,304
I would love to get them

713
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:48,096
They're not hypocrisy.

714
00:35:48,352 --> 00:35:51,424
Bible

715
00:35:52,448 --> 00:35:55,264
OSHA real Christians have already been down the road of evil

716
00:35:55,776 --> 00:35:58,592
Sex or drugs whatever they get there. Democrats

717
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:00,128
President

718
00:36:00,384 --> 00:36:00,896
The judge

719
00:36:01,152 --> 00:36:01,920
They judge the heart

720
00:36:02,432 --> 00:36:02,944
My God does

721
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,736
And everybody else

722
00:36:06,016 --> 00:36:08,320
I'm never going to sit here and steer you wrong

723
00:36:09,088 --> 00:36:11,392
Yes you will

724
00:36:13,184 --> 00:36:14,464
I'll give you this Blanche

725
00:36:15,488 --> 00:36:16,512
Nobody's buying me off

726
00:36:17,024 --> 00:36:18,560
Yeah right

727
00:36:18,816 --> 00:36:24,960
Probably break time's over aren't true in a row and then you say

728
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:26,496
But I'll tell you something that is

729
00:36:28,032 --> 00:36:34,176
It's also not true right situation

730
00:36:34,432 --> 00:36:35,712
You can just be like

731
00:36:35,968 --> 00:36:36,992
I never said that you did

732
00:36:37,504 --> 00:36:41,344
He never did that

733
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:42,880
But I'll tell you this

734
00:36:43,136 --> 00:36:49,280
I'm definitely doing this I'm real

735
00:36:50,304 --> 00:36:56,192
Machine-gun lies that expect me to believe the last part

736
00:36:56,704 --> 00:36:59,520
The thing that you say I kind of agree with him a lot of them

737
00:36:59,776 --> 00:37:00,288
Some have been around

738
00:37:00,544 --> 00:37:02,592
The block and one of the reasons is because

739
00:37:03,616 --> 00:37:04,896
Addiction work

740
00:37:05,152 --> 00:37:07,968
Is generally you have to replace one addiction with another

741
00:37:08,224 --> 00:37:10,784
That's what a lot of people do aren't treated

742
00:37:12,064 --> 00:37:15,136
Can you end up having a lot of people

743
00:37:15,392 --> 00:37:17,696
Exercise

744
00:37:18,208 --> 00:37:19,232
Who are born again

745
00:37:19,488 --> 00:37:20,512
I may find Jesus

746
00:37:20,768 --> 00:37:21,536
Eminem Jesus

747
00:37:21,792 --> 00:37:22,304
It becomes everyday

748
00:37:23,072 --> 00:37:26,912
Community absolutely is been around the block

749
00:37:27,168 --> 00:37:28,192
That's not good

750
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:29,728
Vegetable art

751
00:37:29,984 --> 00:37:30,752
Again

752
00:37:31,008 --> 00:37:34,592
Painting with a broad brush I don't mean everybody certainly but there is

753
00:37:34,848 --> 00:37:38,176
From my experience growing up

754
00:37:38,432 --> 00:37:41,504
There's a lot of people who are just mainlining

755
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:44,576
Pretty much and that's not a healthy way to look at

756
00:37:47,904 --> 00:37:49,696
Maybe we can have a discussion

757
00:37:50,464 --> 00:37:51,232
The other one

758
00:37:53,792 --> 00:37:57,632
All up in everybody else's business about acting moral

759
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:03,264
Those are the ones who are being Hypocrites you know the ones who are like hey

760
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:06,336
Gay people can't get married because marriage is sacred

761
00:38:06,848 --> 00:38:09,920
Those are the ones who look over it Trump sham marriages

762
00:38:10,944 --> 00:38:12,736
Mail order brides

763
00:38:13,248 --> 00:38:15,296
And they're like

764
00:38:15,808 --> 00:38:16,832
That's good marriage

765
00:38:17,344 --> 00:38:19,392
But all of those gay people God hates you

766
00:38:22,976 --> 00:38:27,584
Yeah sorry this makes clip Alex speculates that he's going to

767
00:38:29,632 --> 00:38:30,656
The whole time

768
00:38:30,912 --> 00:38:31,424
Most of my life

769
00:38:31,936 --> 00:38:34,752
Speculate

770
00:38:36,032 --> 00:38:37,824
Live long is also

771
00:38:40,128 --> 00:38:40,896
I'm 44

772
00:38:41,664 --> 00:38:43,200
Stop doing this

773
00:38:43,968 --> 00:38:46,016
But I have to keep on cuz they're trying to push me out

774
00:38:46,784 --> 00:38:47,296
That makes sense

775
00:38:48,064 --> 00:38:49,600
Also

776
00:38:49,856 --> 00:38:51,904
Well no it's just his weird

777
00:38:53,696 --> 00:38:54,208
Kind of thing

778
00:38:54,464 --> 00:38:58,304
But also there's another motif of this

779
00:38:58,560 --> 00:38:59,840
Keeps talking about wanting to quit

780
00:39:02,144 --> 00:39:07,776
I understand totally acquitted

781
00:39:08,032 --> 00:39:08,544
Don't work

782
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,080
Outside of like

783
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:11,872
Fascist regime

784
00:39:13,152 --> 00:39:15,200
People are really

785
00:39:15,712 --> 00:39:21,088
You can't be your it's really worked out super well for him until people started paying attention

786
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:23,904
He got hooked up with Trump and everyone like hold

787
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:25,440
TalkBack threatened that's a

788
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:29,280
The problem he can fly under the radar making millions of dollars every year

789
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:32,352
Easter is profile is too high

790
00:39:32,864 --> 00:39:34,400
And it's really becoming a problem

791
00:39:34,912 --> 00:39:35,424
You should quit

792
00:39:36,704 --> 00:39:39,264
Butter how hard do matter how bad it gets I'm going on again

793
00:39:39,776 --> 00:39:41,056
Jackson Give Up on Humanity

794
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:42,080
Right I'd watch

795
00:39:44,384 --> 00:39:45,920
72 president

796
00:39:46,176 --> 00:39:47,200
Without you my sexy

797
00:39:48,736 --> 00:39:50,016
Pressure

798
00:39:50,272 --> 00:39:52,064
Exactly

799
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:56,160
I'll be honest with you makes me sometimes just want to

800
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:58,720
Have it all over with

801
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:04,352
Jordan

802
00:40:04,864 --> 00:40:05,632
I know

803
00:40:05,888 --> 00:40:08,448
I got to get my soul in line

804
00:40:08,704 --> 00:40:09,728
God

805
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:13,056
All you fools don't believe in God you've never

806
00:40:13,312 --> 00:40:14,848
Tasted a tire thing

807
00:40:15,104 --> 00:40:19,200
Somebody put that on no papers tomorrow morning

808
00:40:20,224 --> 00:40:22,272
I want you to experience what I seen

809
00:40:22,784 --> 00:40:24,832
Mere glimpses of the mind of God

810
00:40:26,112 --> 00:40:28,672
Unspeakable understanding unspeakable Grace

811
00:40:28,928 --> 00:40:32,000
Unspeakable will a speakable Beauty unspeakable

812
00:40:32,256 --> 00:40:33,536
Unspeakable power

813
00:40:33,792 --> 00:40:35,328
Unspeakable fidgets

814
00:40:35,584 --> 00:40:36,864
Unspeakable bread

815
00:40:37,888 --> 00:40:38,912
Speakable

816
00:40:39,168 --> 00:40:39,936
Give three horses

817
00:40:41,216 --> 00:40:41,728
The followers app

818
00:40:45,312 --> 00:40:49,408
I got my time zones messed up

819
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:51,968
Speakable

820
00:40:55,552 --> 00:40:57,088
Basketball

821
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:58,112
And

822
00:40:58,624 --> 00:41:01,184
And Bone Thugs-N-Harmony was there

823
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:02,464
I don't know why they were there

824
00:41:03,744 --> 00:41:04,768
Crossroads

825
00:41:12,704 --> 00:41:14,496
He's got

826
00:41:15,008 --> 00:41:18,592
32 hour marathon

827
00:41:19,104 --> 00:41:22,176
This is at 8 p.m. Austin

828
00:41:29,344 --> 00:41:35,488
Guinness drunk I just mean this is a conversation of a man who's like

829
00:41:35,744 --> 00:41:37,792
It's about closing time at the barn is like

830
00:41:38,048 --> 00:41:43,936
I don't know what I'm going to do with my life I don't know what's going on right now

831
00:41:44,192 --> 00:41:50,336
Our twenty-four of marathon he's been screaming the whole time

832
00:41:50,592 --> 00:41:52,128
In a cigarette in front of them

833
00:41:53,663 --> 00:41:55,711
Speakable vistas of anger

834
00:41:55,967 --> 00:41:57,759
Or whatever that is

835
00:41:58,015 --> 00:41:58,783
Space is in

836
00:41:59,039 --> 00:42:01,855
YouTube videos normal show for 3 hours

837
00:42:19,775 --> 00:42:23,615
So in this next everybody has lawyers apologized

838
00:42:23,871 --> 00:42:24,639
Before I play this next

839
00:42:25,407 --> 00:42:27,967
Because we're going to include

840
00:42:28,223 --> 00:42:28,735
The clipse

841
00:42:28,991 --> 00:42:30,015
So Trump talking about gun

842
00:42:30,271 --> 00:42:31,295
Control

843
00:42:33,855 --> 00:42:34,367
Because it's

844
00:42:34,623 --> 00:42:35,647
Crazy that Alex

845
00:42:35,903 --> 00:42:37,439
Actually playing those clips

846
00:42:37,695 --> 00:42:38,463
It's nuts

847
00:42:38,975 --> 00:42:42,047
Normally you would just ignore this or something like that

848
00:42:42,303 --> 00:42:45,631
Keep playing these clips included

849
00:42:45,887 --> 00:42:46,399
Says

850
00:42:46,655 --> 00:42:47,423
We're going to get this

851
00:42:49,727 --> 00:42:50,751
To work with you on this

852
00:42:51,263 --> 00:42:53,823
And then you'll see how many hours before

853
00:42:55,615 --> 00:42:56,383
What are you

854
00:42:57,151 --> 00:42:57,919
20 minutes

855
00:43:00,735 --> 00:43:01,759
Listen to these clips

856
00:43:02,271 --> 00:43:03,807
And then listen to what how Alex

857
00:43:04,063 --> 00:43:05,599
Deals with it immediately

858
00:43:06,111 --> 00:43:06,623
I think it's very

859
00:43:07,647 --> 00:43:09,951
Dianne Feinstein

860
00:43:11,231 --> 00:43:12,767
And then we're going to go

861
00:43:13,023 --> 00:43:15,327
The trouble I like taking the guns early

862
00:43:15,583 --> 00:43:17,887
Then due process just a horrible statement

863
00:43:18,399 --> 00:43:22,495
On the biggest family Honore lawmakers are Friday and I really like a double sided meaning

864
00:43:27,103 --> 00:43:28,127
Your phone calls

865
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:31,455
It is Thursday night is 9:43 Central

866
00:43:34,015 --> 00:43:39,647
That would be great also

867
00:44:01,151 --> 00:44:01,919
Number States

868
00:44:13,951 --> 00:44:20,095
Firearms first and then go to court

869
00:44:25,727 --> 00:44:29,055
Musicfirst depositors I can just point out like this

870
00:44:29,823 --> 00:44:31,103
It sounds like

871
00:44:32,127 --> 00:44:33,151
Progress or something

872
00:44:33,663 --> 00:44:34,175
I guess

873
00:44:34,431 --> 00:44:35,455
It's not you still crazy

874
00:44:36,223 --> 00:44:37,759
Only thing I want

875
00:44:38,015 --> 00:44:38,783
It is like

876
00:44:39,551 --> 00:44:40,575
Obama's never said

877
00:44:40,831 --> 00:44:42,111
Anythink

878
00:44:45,951 --> 00:44:47,999
Even remotely close to

879
00:44:48,255 --> 00:44:53,887
Let's circumvent the courts and take people's guns and metal go to court

880
00:44:55,935 --> 00:44:57,471
These people are stupid

881
00:44:57,727 --> 00:44:58,239
Not

882
00:44:58,495 --> 00:45:02,591
He's crazy like

883
00:45:02,847 --> 00:45:08,991
Did none of you see this coming sooner or later he's

884
00:45:10,783 --> 00:45:13,599
Oh s*** that's a good idea

885
00:45:13,855 --> 00:45:19,999
Al Green

886
00:45:20,511 --> 00:45:21,791
I hate domestic violence

887
00:45:22,047 --> 00:45:28,191
Would that apply to me that part of it is actually real

888
00:45:28,447 --> 00:45:28,959
Really important

889
00:45:29,215 --> 00:45:34,335
That is a lot of the domestic violence guideline

890
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:37,919
A lot of states only relate to like

891
00:45:38,431 --> 00:45:44,319
Husbands and wives exactly

892
00:45:45,087 --> 00:45:46,367
Your girlfriend and still get a gun

893
00:45:46,623 --> 00:45:47,903
Better things

894
00:45:48,159 --> 00:45:50,719
Those are the sort of loopholes that

895
00:45:51,743 --> 00:45:52,511
About including

896
00:45:55,583 --> 00:46:00,447
A million times over is one of these

897
00:46:00,703 --> 00:46:01,471
It's probably the number one

898
00:46:01,727 --> 00:46:02,751
Vindicator

899
00:46:03,263 --> 00:46:04,031
The sort of behavior

900
00:46:05,567 --> 00:46:06,591
Procedures

901
00:46:09,919 --> 00:46:15,807
Crazy man's case

902
00:46:22,975 --> 00:46:29,119
No bigger fan

903
00:46:29,375 --> 00:46:35,519
It doesn't make sense that I have to wait till

904
00:46:35,775 --> 00:46:41,919
21

905
00:46:54,975 --> 00:47:00,863
A lot of people are afraid of

906
00:47:02,143 --> 00:47:07,263
Dianne Feinstein of California

907
00:47:08,287 --> 00:47:09,823
Behind herself

908
00:47:10,847 --> 00:47:13,151
She's beside herself like she's entered Heaven There

909
00:47:13,919 --> 00:47:16,991
She can't believe you sound just like DACA

910
00:47:18,783 --> 00:47:20,319
You always said during a campaign

911
00:47:20,575 --> 00:47:23,647
1020

912
00:47:26,463 --> 00:47:29,279
Zodiac

913
00:47:29,791 --> 00:47:34,399
Anime

914
00:47:35,423 --> 00:47:37,215
Common cold

915
00:47:42,335 --> 00:47:43,103
Bigelow

916
00:47:49,247 --> 00:47:51,295
So that was really interesting

917
00:47:51,551 --> 00:47:52,575
Expressing

918
00:47:53,087 --> 00:47:55,391
Some people

919
00:47:55,647 --> 00:47:56,671
Enough

920
00:47:57,951 --> 00:47:59,999
He never said that you didn't hate Mexican

921
00:48:00,255 --> 00:48:02,303
I think there's a lot of people

922
00:48:03,071 --> 00:48:04,607
Play the places

923
00:48:04,863 --> 00:48:07,423
Message boards

924
00:48:09,727 --> 00:48:10,495
You got story

925
00:48:12,031 --> 00:48:14,079
Yeah he even plays this long

926
00:48:14,335 --> 00:48:15,103
Collection of clips

927
00:48:16,639 --> 00:48:18,431
Very clearly

928
00:48:18,687 --> 00:48:22,527
I'm going to help get this built

929
00:48:23,039 --> 00:48:24,831
I agree

930
00:48:31,487 --> 00:48:35,327
What you can't even how stupid is it

931
00:48:35,583 --> 00:48:36,863
Even Trump

932
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:42,239
No that doesn't make sense and then that's how stupid the NRA and then

933
00:48:42,495 --> 00:48:44,031
Disagrees with you

934
00:48:44,287 --> 00:48:46,591
Quit please like hey why haven't you guys made any

935
00:48:46,847 --> 00:48:49,407
Any progress on this you're afraid of the NRA

936
00:48:49,663 --> 00:48:55,807
Talking about in the Middle where it's hilarious and that's why is it Heaven it's not be

937
00:48:56,063 --> 00:48:57,343
Because she thinks this matters

938
00:48:57,599 --> 00:49:01,695
Right now because she's going to get her bill pass or anything like that it's because

939
00:49:01,951 --> 00:49:06,303
F****** hilarious to be in the room

940
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:08,607
Brother getting dunked on but the same time

941
00:49:08,863 --> 00:49:10,399
I feel like there is a part of her that

942
00:49:10,655 --> 00:49:13,727
Things like maybe we can make progress on this

943
00:49:16,543 --> 00:49:19,103
Probably she's a horrible horrible.

944
00:49:19,615 --> 00:49:21,919
I'm not but I also think

945
00:49:22,175 --> 00:49:23,199
Irrelevant conversation

946
00:49:23,455 --> 00:49:24,991
Listen

947
00:49:25,247 --> 00:49:27,551
He's not about how she's smiling

948
00:49:29,855 --> 00:49:30,879
Because otherwise

949
00:49:31,135 --> 00:49:32,415
I got to wrestle with

950
00:49:33,183 --> 00:49:33,951
Holyshit

951
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:40,095
This is worse

952
00:49:47,263 --> 00:49:52,639
And you just like I had to guess I would say that during that like

953
00:49:52,895 --> 00:49:54,943
2 minutes is probably when he was chugging

954
00:49:55,199 --> 00:49:55,967
Some Jameson

955
00:49:56,223 --> 00:49:57,759
I imagine he was a group because it

956
00:49:58,015 --> 00:50:00,575
The video is off Hamilton playing a video of trump

957
00:50:01,087 --> 00:50:03,647
It's a good opportunity for him to get a little booze and

958
00:50:04,159 --> 00:50:06,463
A bit more f***** up

959
00:50:06,719 --> 00:50:07,487
Pretty quick after that

960
00:50:09,279 --> 00:50:12,351
Cuz I was watching it and I like this is a roller coaster a booze

961
00:50:12,863 --> 00:50:15,679
Zenith pretty Gravely drunk there at the beginning

962
00:50:15,935 --> 00:50:17,471
And then pretty quick here

963
00:50:18,495 --> 00:50:19,775
Ends up getting to like this

964
00:50:20,031 --> 00:50:24,383
The drunk esoteric Alex we know and then by the time it's over it's

965
00:50:25,663 --> 00:50:26,687
Angry crashed

966
00:50:26,943 --> 00:50:28,479
The Angry Birds

967
00:50:29,503 --> 00:50:30,015
Alex

968
00:50:32,063 --> 00:50:32,831
What's up

969
00:50:35,903 --> 00:50:36,671
This quote

970
00:50:37,183 --> 00:50:38,207
To condemning Trump

971
00:50:38,719 --> 00:50:39,999
This close

972
00:50:40,255 --> 00:50:41,535
But he gets sidetracked by what

973
00:50:42,303 --> 00:50:42,815
Who's more in it

974
00:50:43,071 --> 00:50:43,839
Is Mooyah

975
00:50:44,095 --> 00:50:44,607
As a journalist

976
00:50:51,007 --> 00:50:57,151
You just watched Dianne Feinstein

977
00:51:00,479 --> 00:51:04,063
Let me see giant

978
00:51:10,719 --> 00:51:12,511
I like all that he's Afro-American

979
00:51:12,767 --> 00:51:15,327
Populist

980
00:51:15,583 --> 00:51:17,631
Not.

981
00:51:18,143 --> 00:51:19,423
Ignatov

982
00:51:22,751 --> 00:51:23,775
Don't you get it president

983
00:51:24,543 --> 00:51:27,103
They're not going to let you be the pragmatist it's all

984
00:51:27,359 --> 00:51:33,503
A big joke

985
00:51:33,759 --> 00:51:35,039
Wizard of Oz

986
00:51:35,295 --> 00:51:36,319
Funny plays

987
00:51:36,575 --> 00:51:37,599
Dianne Feinstein

988
00:51:37,855 --> 00:51:43,743
Holy crap together and spiraling on a loop intersperses video of the Wicked Witch of the West

989
00:51:51,423 --> 00:51:57,567
Definitely not deal with the fact that we elected a crazy like we should have known he was always going

990
00:51:59,615 --> 00:52:00,639
The simplest

991
00:52:01,151 --> 00:52:02,175
Point vet

992
00:52:02,431 --> 00:52:04,223
Furiated the right literally

993
00:52:07,551 --> 00:52:08,319
Well yeah

994
00:52:08,575 --> 00:52:11,391
I mean if it if you have to wait until 21 to get a handgun

995
00:52:12,159 --> 00:52:15,999
Shouldn't have to wait until 21 to get all done well

996
00:52:16,511 --> 00:52:21,887
Because the easiest argument to make is the exact argument

997
00:52:22,143 --> 00:52:23,423
Justin reverse is like we should make

998
00:52:23,679 --> 00:52:25,727
All of them 18 cuz you could

999
00:52:25,983 --> 00:52:30,335
Just using the same information and make that argument

1000
00:52:30,591 --> 00:52:31,615
You know what it's like it's like

1001
00:52:31,871 --> 00:52:34,687
Hiring like a wolverine

1002
00:52:35,199 --> 00:52:37,759
There's nothing like that just because of Wolverine is like

1003
00:52:38,015 --> 00:52:40,063
Tidy up sometime or whatever

1004
00:52:40,319 --> 00:52:43,903
All of a sudden it f****** attack you while you sleep or whatever you like

1005
00:52:44,671 --> 00:52:50,815
Great analogy to your house

1006
00:52:57,471 --> 00:52:58,751
The Wolverine

1007
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:08,223
I lost a metaphor

1008
00:53:08,479 --> 00:53:09,247
Is where I picked up

1009
00:53:10,527 --> 00:53:11,807
You judge me by Trish

1010
00:53:12,575 --> 00:53:14,623
Fry said that in my life I learned

1011
00:53:18,207 --> 00:53:20,767
You judge a restaurant

1012
00:53:22,047 --> 00:53:25,887
Put on table take care of his wife

1013
00:53:31,519 --> 00:53:36,383
Beautiful

1014
00:53:36,639 --> 00:53:37,151
G.

1015
00:53:41,759 --> 00:53:45,343
Popping babies out of a 5 Seconds

1016
00:53:47,903 --> 00:53:49,951
How many miscarriages

1017
00:53:50,975 --> 00:53:55,327
I got 20

1018
00:54:00,191 --> 00:54:01,471
You get what I'm saying

1019
00:54:05,823 --> 00:54:08,127
So that's what I'm saying here is

1020
00:54:08,639 --> 00:54:10,943
Nobody's going to turn on Trump harder than me

1021
00:54:11,711 --> 00:54:14,015
That's

1022
00:54:20,927 --> 00:54:21,951
That clip

1023
00:54:22,207 --> 00:54:23,231
That clip

1024
00:54:25,791 --> 00:54:26,303
Okay

1025
00:54:28,607 --> 00:54:30,655
Fox

1026
00:54:31,167 --> 00:54:34,239
But the f*****-up are you thinking about anything now hold on

1027
00:54:36,031 --> 00:54:37,567
No it's not what it is

1028
00:54:37,823 --> 00:54:38,847
The first part of it

1029
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:39,871
Totally

1030
00:54:40,127 --> 00:54:45,759
Restaurant by what they serve you as food

1031
00:54:46,015 --> 00:54:52,159
Find a better 4/1

1032
00:54:52,415 --> 00:54:54,463
Think about their service

1033
00:54:54,719 --> 00:54:55,999
But at the same time

1034
00:54:56,255 --> 00:55:02,399
Food is good enough baby you don't care baby like exactly

1035
00:55:06,751 --> 00:55:07,263
Odo

1036
00:55:07,519 --> 00:55:13,663
Cuz Rose really just like humans are only as good as their reproductive

1037
00:55:16,223 --> 00:55:18,015
Look if a woman can't Berry kids

1038
00:55:18,271 --> 00:55:19,551
Not saying she's a bad person

1039
00:55:20,063 --> 00:55:20,575
I'm just saying

1040
00:55:20,831 --> 00:55:26,975
She doesn't count as a human being right now the problem is of no Worth to the rest of the speech problem

1041
00:55:27,231 --> 00:55:27,743
He's like

1042
00:55:27,999 --> 00:55:30,559
If if it was devoid of Conte

1043
00:55:31,071 --> 00:55:33,375
He was just saying if it was

1044
00:55:33,631 --> 00:55:34,655
She's not fertile

1045
00:55:34,911 --> 00:55:36,703
Yes

1046
00:55:36,959 --> 00:55:43,103
It's surrounded by is the quality of a thing

1047
00:55:50,783 --> 00:55:54,367
Yep

1048
00:55:54,623 --> 00:55:57,951
420 baby

1049
00:55:58,207 --> 00:56:00,255
One miscarriage

1050
00:56:00,511 --> 00:56:04,095
Look still a goddess I'm not saying music

1051
00:56:04,607 --> 00:56:07,167
Nobody going to turn on Trump harder than

1052
00:56:07,423 --> 00:56:10,495
Perfect metaphor even further into

1053
00:56:11,775 --> 00:56:15,359
The Trump is popping out babies every 5 minutes or whatever

1054
00:56:15,615 --> 00:56:16,383
My response to

1055
00:56:17,663 --> 00:56:20,991
That is not long enough gestational.

1056
00:56:21,247 --> 00:56:23,807
18 popping out on viable baby

1057
00:56:30,463 --> 00:56:36,607
Analogy

1058
00:56:38,399 --> 00:56:40,191
Quality of babies

1059
00:56:40,703 --> 00:56:41,471
That's a large

1060
00:56:41,983 --> 00:56:42,495
There

1061
00:56:43,007 --> 00:56:45,567
Yeah and I don't care. Packet I just think that that is

1062
00:56:45,823 --> 00:56:46,847
Incredibly incredibly

1063
00:56:47,103 --> 00:56:48,639
Buck job that's a weird way of thinking

1064
00:56:48,895 --> 00:56:51,199
The weird way of thinking about

1065
00:56:51,711 --> 00:56:54,527
Yes all of those things he said weird

1066
00:56:54,783 --> 00:57:00,927
What's crazy is there weird and different

1067
00:57:01,183 --> 00:57:03,231
None of it is like uniform crazy

1068
00:57:03,487 --> 00:57:05,791
You judge a man by what he can put on the table

1069
00:57:06,047 --> 00:57:08,607
And how many babies he can put in you

1070
00:57:08,863 --> 00:57:10,143
That makes sense right

1071
00:57:10,399 --> 00:57:13,471
That's exactly how we should judge human

1072
00:57:13,983 --> 00:57:14,751
Stop

1073
00:57:16,031 --> 00:57:17,311
So weird

1074
00:57:17,823 --> 00:57:23,967
That would make sense maybe or like a farmer

1075
00:57:24,223 --> 00:57:30,367
Chinese farmer would be like from The Orphan Train

1076
00:57:30,623 --> 00:57:35,487
Living in like a subsistence economy where you have to grow your food

1077
00:57:35,999 --> 00:57:37,279
Tend the livestock

1078
00:57:37,535 --> 00:57:41,631
Reproduce in order to run your life

1079
00:57:44,191 --> 00:57:50,335
Lucky children are free labor is what Alex just said that are free labor

1080
00:57:51,359 --> 00:57:52,895
One of the only rationalization

1081
00:57:54,687 --> 00:57:56,991
The only real world example where it's like

1082
00:57:57,247 --> 00:57:58,527
I do what you're saying

1083
00:57:58,783 --> 00:57:59,551
Wild

1084
00:57:59,807 --> 00:58:01,855
But to be like in Austin

1085
00:58:02,111 --> 00:58:03,647
Right-wing radio host

1086
00:58:03,903 --> 00:58:05,183
And hold those views

1087
00:58:05,695 --> 00:58:08,767
It smacks of just like you don't see people as people

1088
00:58:09,535 --> 00:58:11,071
You see people at breathing machine

1089
00:58:12,351 --> 00:58:12,863
Pretty f*****-up

1090
00:58:13,119 --> 00:58:13,887
When is the next clip

1091
00:58:14,655 --> 00:58:18,495
Route to talking about how like I believe he's still on the line

1092
00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:22,847
Buy cuz of course

1093
00:58:23,103 --> 00:58:24,383
If he does

1094
00:58:24,895 --> 00:58:26,687
F****** vets

1095
00:58:27,711 --> 00:58:29,247
He starts talking about a signature

1096
00:58:31,039 --> 00:58:33,343
Spoiler alert for what's happening

1097
00:58:35,135 --> 00:58:37,695
And during the long pauses he's got the document cam

1098
00:58:39,231 --> 00:58:41,023
On the piece of paper in front of him

1099
00:58:41,279 --> 00:58:42,047
And if you'd like

1100
00:58:42,303 --> 00:58:43,327
If Trump signs at

1101
00:58:45,631 --> 00:58:47,679
I didn't realize that the cameras on it

1102
00:58:48,191 --> 00:58:48,959
Bonnie Wright

1103
00:58:49,983 --> 00:58:51,007
Besides Donald Trump

1104
00:58:51,263 --> 00:58:52,031
Name underneath it

1105
00:58:52,287 --> 00:58:53,055
As he's talking

1106
00:58:53,567 --> 00:58:54,079
And then

1107
00:58:54,335 --> 00:58:55,359
Just starts make

1108
00:58:55,615 --> 00:58:56,383
Can a line of.

1109
00:59:06,623 --> 00:59:08,415
They're not

1110
00:59:09,183 --> 00:59:11,231
I'm such a purist I wouldn't do that

1111
00:59:11,487 --> 00:59:12,255
That's why I'm not surprised

1112
00:59:14,559 --> 00:59:16,863
There's a lot of race do not president

1113
00:59:17,631 --> 00:59:18,143
Shoebill

1114
00:59:19,423 --> 00:59:20,959
He puts his name

1115
00:59:23,263 --> 00:59:24,287
He takes Bell

1116
00:59:25,311 --> 00:59:28,639
The ban all semi-automatic rifles of Dianne Feinstein sign

1117
00:59:34,015 --> 00:59:35,295
He's playing it out

1118
00:59:38,367 --> 00:59:39,391
Donald J Trump

1119
00:59:42,463 --> 00:59:43,999
He's going to be some big problems

1120
00:59:45,279 --> 00:59:47,327
That crazy signature

1121
00:59:56,287 --> 00:59:57,823
Guarantee this thing

1122
00:59:59,359 --> 01:00:00,639
Never Back Down

1123
01:00:00,895 --> 01:00:06,271
Pointed back to his own signature

1124
01:00:06,527 --> 01:00:08,319
Over enunciate incontinence

1125
01:00:08,575 --> 01:00:10,623
Form of drama

1126
01:00:13,439 --> 01:00:14,719
Never compromise

1127
01:00:18,303 --> 01:00:19,583
Audi

1128
01:00:24,447 --> 01:00:26,495
I'm not sitting here saying I'm a greater man

1129
01:00:29,823 --> 01:00:32,383
Disney problem

1130
01:00:35,455 --> 01:00:39,551
I'm not like other man in my life better than a real man

1131
01:00:39,807 --> 01:00:42,879
That's what I see my better relationship one

1132
01:00:43,391 --> 01:00:44,159
Yeah you're totally

1133
01:00:45,439 --> 01:00:47,999
I'm a big man

1134
01:00:57,471 --> 01:01:01,823
Because he says It'll recognize a better man on the pizza I want to see

1135
01:01:02,079 --> 01:01:06,687
Judged I want to go to him like the Oracle of Delphi want to go to

1136
01:01:07,711 --> 01:01:10,271
Also

1137
01:01:10,527 --> 01:01:13,855
I made all these so I'm definitely better than you great man

1138
01:01:14,367 --> 01:01:17,695
Lary over there he was a miscarriage

1139
01:01:17,951 --> 01:01:19,743
But I carry him around and toe and memory

1140
01:01:20,255 --> 01:01:23,583
I'm so Alex realizes he doesn't have enough content

1141
01:01:23,839 --> 01:01:25,631
To do his late night shift

1142
01:01:25,887 --> 01:01:29,727
To-do at 34 hour marathon

1143
01:01:29,983 --> 01:01:31,519
Besides to go to Kohl's

1144
01:01:31,775 --> 01:01:33,823
Howdy

1145
01:01:34,847 --> 01:01:35,615
Go to Costco

1146
01:01:35,871 --> 01:01:37,919
New York

1147
01:01:38,175 --> 01:01:40,223
Hell yeah

1148
01:01:40,735 --> 01:01:42,527
Here and Harvard

1149
01:01:42,783 --> 01:01:46,111
Brenda Radford man right now but

1150
01:01:48,159 --> 01:01:49,695
I'm the type of person that

1151
01:01:51,487 --> 01:01:53,023
When I am which I usually am

1152
01:01:53,535 --> 01:01:54,303
You're usually right

1153
01:01:54,815 --> 01:01:58,911
Emergency usually with our sales ocean

1154
01:01:59,423 --> 01:02:04,031
Ships on the blood in our heart blood veins

1155
01:02:09,663 --> 01:02:10,687
It's paradox

1156
01:02:12,223 --> 01:02:15,807
Cuz I do these promos under these sales raise money

1157
01:02:17,087 --> 01:02:23,231
50% off rolling like 10 bucks on Friday night always paradoxes of financial

1158
01:02:23,487 --> 01:02:29,631
Squeeze

1159
01:02:29,887 --> 01:02:31,935
Make less money

1160
01:02:33,727 --> 01:02:34,751
It's just Bad Manners

1161
01:02:35,775 --> 01:02:36,543
Play Foreigner.

1162
01:02:37,311 --> 01:02:41,407
Why do donation lines and millions of dollars on donations every year

1163
01:02:41,919 --> 01:02:45,247
Thalia donation button on a word., prisonplanet.com

1164
01:02:45,759 --> 01:02:46,527
They're only about

1165
01:02:46,783 --> 01:02:48,575
Support sectioning

1166
01:02:49,087 --> 01:02:51,903
Sunrise like $10,000 a day on that

1167
01:02:52,671 --> 01:02:55,743
Couple

Hard thousand dollars profit

1170
01:02:59,839 --> 01:03:00,863
You should not be

1171
01:03:01,119 --> 01:03:02,911
Telling people your business model

1172
01:03:03,167 --> 01:03:03,935
Very bad

1173
01:03:05,471 --> 01:03:08,287
If you're getting $100,000 in profit

1174
01:03:08,543 --> 01:03:09,823
You're crushing it

1175
01:03:10,335 --> 01:03:13,919
No

1176
01:03:14,175 --> 01:03:14,943
Not for what Jeep

1177
01:03:15,199 --> 01:03:15,711
Pretences audio

1178
01:03:17,503 --> 01:03:18,527
I just meant

1179
01:03:20,063 --> 01:03:22,623
1/3 pocketbooks pretty good

1180
01:03:23,647 --> 01:03:24,159

1181
01:03:24,415 --> 01:03:25,951
Goodnight baby

1182
01:03:26,207 --> 01:03:29,535
But still $300,000 worth of products

1183
01:03:29,791 --> 01:03:30,559
Forgotten like 10,000

1184
01:03:30,815 --> 01:03:31,327
Donations

1185
01:03:31,583 --> 01:03:34,399
When he gets off of errors that will be 12 hours

1186
01:03:34,911 --> 01:03:35,679
The marathon

1187
01:03:35,935 --> 01:03:37,983
You got to assume you're not making any money with it

1188
01:03:38,239 --> 01:03:38,751
300

1189
01:03:39,007 --> 01:03:40,543

Shift right with the Harrison Smith

1191
01:03:43,359 --> 01:03:46,687
Boring everyone to sleep

1192
01:03:47,455 --> 01:03:48,735
Like legitimately that's

1193
01:03:48,991 --> 01:03:49,759
Really bad

1194
01:03:50,015 --> 01:03:53,343
It's a lot of money but that's really bad based on what

1195
01:03:53,599 --> 01:03:54,111
He expect

1196
01:03:54,367 --> 01:03:55,647
Text to Macon what he pretends.

1197
01:03:56,415 --> 01:03:58,207
You should not be saying these things are there

1198
01:03:58,719 --> 01:03:59,743
Probably.

1199
01:04:01,279 --> 01:04:02,815
Witchduck Bay products

1200

Globalist grocery

1204
01:04:20,991 --> 01:04:22,271
So close to car

1205
01:04:23,807 --> 01:04:24,831
You're crazy

1206
01:04:26,367 --> 01:04:28,415
If you don't go to Infowars store.com

1207
01:04:29,183 --> 01:04:34,815
Angle

1208
01:04:35,071 --> 01:04:36,863
Proud of shutdown

1209
01:04:37,119 --> 01:04:38,399
Her Facebook or Twitter

1210
01:04:39,167 --> 01:04:41,471
CC there he's using the YouTube

1211
01:04:41,727 --> 01:04:44,543
Situation

1212
01:04:44,799 --> 01:04:47,871
We're going to need you because they're going to get us

1213
01:04:48,127 --> 01:04:49,407
That's a big part of my

1214
01:04:50,687 --> 01:04:51,711
Is not a winning strategy

1215
01:04:51,967 --> 01:04:52,991
Interpret

1216
01:04:53,503 --> 01:04:54,783
And I

1217
01:04:56,063 --> 01:04:58,367
Sexual assault

1218
01:04:58,623 --> 01:05:02,463
Well and I'm touched her on the back

1219
01:05:08,095 --> 01:05:09,375
Yes I'm blaming the women

1220
01:05:13,471 --> 01:05:19,615
Exactly

1221
01:05:22,175 --> 01:05:24,223
That you have a gun

1222
01:05:27,295 --> 01:05:30,623
Are though really like it like her wanting

1223
01:05:30,879 --> 01:05:31,647
Concealed carry class

1224
01:05:32,159 --> 01:05:32,927
There whatever is irrelevant

1225
01:05:34,207 --> 01:05:35,487
Like even if she's saying that she

1226
01:05:35,743 --> 01:05:37,791
She felt intimidated by everyone carrying guns

1227
01:05:38,047 --> 01:05:38,559
At the office

1228
01:05:39,071 --> 01:05:39,583
Like

1229
01:05:39,839 --> 01:05:40,351
That doesn't

1230
01:05:40,607 --> 01:05:41,631
Just because she wanted

1231
01:05:42,143 --> 01:05:44,191
Classes on it that doesn't invalidate the

1232
01:05:44,447 --> 01:05:49,567
Intimidated by

1233
01:05:50,079 --> 01:05:53,919
I wouldn't want to work in an office where everyone was also wearing gun

1234
01:05:54,175 --> 01:05:54,687
I've gone

1235
01:05:54,943 --> 01:05:58,527
To the shooting range and number of times in my life and I understand the enjoyment

1236
01:05:58,783 --> 01:06:00,575
Shooting a gun recreationally I can get it

1237
01:06:00,831 --> 01:06:01,855
And I don't I'm not again

1238
01:06:02,111 --> 01:06:02,879
Exploding guns

1239
01:06:03,135 --> 01:06:05,439
As a ruler

1240
01:06:05,695 --> 01:06:07,231
But if I was in an office

1241
01:06:07,487 --> 01:06:09,791
Like when I worked at Groupon if everyone was packing

1242
01:06:10,047 --> 01:06:10,559
I would be

1243
01:06:10,815 --> 01:06:12,351
So scared

1244
01:06:12,607 --> 01:06:15,935
Any small into a very

1245
01:06:16,191 --> 01:06:16,703
Brought

1246
01:06:16,959 --> 01:06:17,983
Mexican standoff

1247
01:06:18,239 --> 01:06:21,055
Very quick especially when you consider like the

1248
01:06:21,567 --> 01:06:22,335
Hair trigger

1249
01:06:22,591 --> 01:06:25,919
Party supply of people like Alex like him going from crying too

1250
01:06:26,175 --> 01:06:29,759
Screaming updated performatively

1251
01:06:30,015 --> 01:06:33,599
Like you're feeling these things breaking stuff

1252
01:06:33,855 --> 01:06:35,903
And commercial breaks and he's even

1253
01:06:41,023 --> 01:06:42,047
That kind of thing is

1254
01:06:42,303 --> 01:06:42,815
Like

1255
01:06:43,071 --> 01:06:44,351
That's not a good environment

1256
01:06:45,631 --> 01:06:46,399
I booked into this

1257
01:06:47,167 --> 01:06:49,215
At the beginning of the

1258
01:06:49,471 --> 01:06:49,983
His first

1259
01:06:50,239 --> 01:06:52,543
Shift when he's talking about this allegation

1260
01:06:52,799 --> 01:06:54,847
He's like open carry the legal

1261
01:06:55,615 --> 01:06:56,383
I looked it up

1262
01:06:56,639 --> 01:06:57,151
It's not

1263
01:06:57,407 --> 01:06:59,455
Open carry is very much allowed

1264
01:06:59,967 --> 01:07:00,735
And if you

1265
01:07:00,991 --> 01:07:02,527
Is it illegal to have open carry or

1266
01:07:02,783 --> 01:07:03,807
Concealed carry in an office

1267
01:07:05,087 --> 01:07:07,903
Do you have to have is you can't have one of those signs

1268
01:07:08,159 --> 01:07:09,183
That says no guns

1269
01:07:09,439 --> 01:07:09,951
Your whatever

1270
01:07:10,207 --> 01:07:11,231
You can have

1271
01:07:11,487 --> 01:07:13,279
You can have guns in private property

1272
01:07:13,791 --> 01:07:14,559
Assuming Alex Jones

1273
01:07:15,071 --> 01:07:15,839
Broadcast

1274
01:07:16,095 --> 01:07:18,911
Cast from private property there's no reason why I couldn't open carry in your office

1275
01:07:20,447 --> 01:07:20,959
Mean something

1276
01:07:21,471 --> 01:07:23,775
Open carry legal in Texas

1277
01:07:24,031 --> 01:07:26,335
Means he's not even aware of the gun laws in his state

1278
01:07:26,591 --> 01:07:27,615
Which is troubling

1279
01:07:28,383 --> 01:07:29,407
Anyway there's a little more

1280
01:07:29,663 --> 01:07:31,455
It's just like

1281
01:07:32,223 --> 01:07:35,551
It's just like Trump and the sexual assault allegations were he's like

1282
01:07:35,807 --> 01:07:38,623
No I never did that you can't prove anything

1283
01:07:39,391 --> 01:07:41,951
How many listen to the clip of himself

1284
01:07:44,255 --> 01:07:47,583
The exact

1285
01:07:49,631 --> 01:07:55,519
I don't have guns out

1286
01:07:56,031 --> 01:07:58,335
Well let's go back to this show whenever you said

1287
01:07:58,591 --> 01:08:04,735
I won't carry guns all over the place

1288
01:08:04,991 --> 01:08:09,599
Play Bedford like that

1289
01:08:09,855 --> 01:08:15,999
Well let's go back to when you called a woman succulent just a minute ago

1290
01:08:18,815 --> 01:08:20,095
Innocent until proven guilty

1291
01:08:20,351 --> 01:08:21,887
But if you've already

1292
01:08:27,519 --> 01:08:29,055
I'm going to go on your guilt

1293
01:08:29,311 --> 01:08:30,847
Call Jordan

1294
01:08:31,359 --> 01:08:32,639
Trump said that that was Locker

1295
01:08:33,407 --> 01:08:34,431
Right

1296
01:08:34,687 --> 01:08:35,711
Incidentally

1297
01:08:35,967 --> 01:08:36,735
It's the same kind of a

1298
01:08:36,991 --> 01:08:38,527
Excuse that's coming out of Infowars

1299
01:08:38,783 --> 01:08:39,551
HR

1300
01:08:39,807 --> 01:08:43,135
Current which is run by Alex

1301
01:08:44,159 --> 01:08:49,023
David Jones runs the HR department

1302
01:08:49,279 --> 01:08:52,095
Yeah yeah that's

1303
01:08:52,351 --> 01:08:57,727
Number one

1304
01:09:00,287 --> 01:09:00,799
Most likely

1305
01:09:01,823 --> 01:09:07,199
When I was reading from the EEOC complaint

1306
01:09:07,711 --> 01:09:08,223
You said he filed

1307
01:09:12,319 --> 01:09:13,599
New did it with this f******

1308
01:09:13,855 --> 01:09:17,183
I think I remember reading in that

1309
01:09:17,439 --> 01:09:18,719
Complaint was that

1310
01:09:18,975 --> 01:09:21,023
I can't can't remember if she said she filed

1311
01:09:21,279 --> 01:09:22,559
Complaints while she work there or not

1312
01:09:22,815 --> 01:09:25,119
Because she didn't know who was in charge of

1313
01:09:26,143 --> 01:09:27,423
So that is

1314
01:09:27,679 --> 01:09:30,751
That's far more likely

1315
01:09:31,775 --> 01:09:32,287
File complaint

1316
01:09:32,799 --> 01:09:36,639
Again

1317
01:09:39,199 --> 01:09:44,831
Talking to your mom because the elementary school bully beat you up and she calls his dad and his dad is

1318
01:09:45,087 --> 01:09:48,415
Clearly like the a****** who's the reason the kids

1322
01:10:04,031 --> 01:10:07,871
Anytime you anytime your boss does something bad you tell his dad on

1323
01:10:10,431 --> 01:10:14,015
Here's the quote for the statement that they made to the Daily Mail

That's crazy

1328
01:10:23,487 --> 01:10:26,815
Raise your email that the Infowars office environment

1329
01:10:27,071 --> 01:10:28,863
Can often be like that of a locker room

1330
01:10:30,655 --> 01:10:31,423
Some had made complaints

1331
01:10:31,679 --> 01:10:37,823
It's HR about certain issues but insisting on writing

1332
01:10:38,079 --> 01:10:38,847
Call Hema p****

1333
01:10:39,359 --> 01:10:40,895

Great band

01:10:51,903 --> 01:10:55,231
The Beast

1338
01:10:58,815 --> 01:11:01,375
Really

1339
01:11:02,399 --> 01:11:02,911
Not good

1340
01:11:03,167 --> 01:11:04,703
Zero tolerance

1341
01:11:04,959 --> 01:11:05,727
For ethnic discrimination

1342
01:11:05,983 --> 01:11:08,287
Conair

1343
01:11:09,567 --> 01:11:10,079
Wow

1344
01:11:10,335 --> 01:11:12,127
Kind of

1345
01:11:13,151 --> 01:11:14,431
Junior said the company is made up of

1346
01:11:14,687 --> 01:11:18,015
Equal opportunity offenders adding

1347
01:11:18,271 --> 01:11:19,295

Enrique of everybody crap

1349
01:11:21,343 --> 01:11:22,623
I'm just being brutally honest here

1350
01:11:22,879 --> 01:11:26,463
From your HR head

1351
01:11:27,487 --> 01:11:33,631
Admission of guilt

1352
01:11:41,311 --> 01:11:41,823
Okay

1353
01:11:42,079 --> 01:11:42,847
I did do that

1354
01:11:49,503 --> 01:11:53,343
Come on man

1355
01:11:53,599 --> 01:11:54,879
It's not totally fine

1356
01:11:55,135 --> 01:11:56,159
If the seventies

1357
01:11:56,415 --> 01:11:57,695

01:12:06,399 --> 01:12:07,935
I feel like that quote Mike

1360
01:12:08,191 --> 01:12:08,703
Come up in court

1361
01:12:08,959 --> 01:12:10,495
In terms of it being like

1362
01:12:11,263 --> 01:12:12,031
Now

1363
01:12:12,287 --> 01:12:13,823
Kind of admitted these allegation

1364
01:12:15,615 --> 01:12:18,943
Foundationally true how do you respond

1365
01:12:20,223 --> 01:12:22,271
Now we're looking at things

1366
01:12:23,551 --> 01:12:25,087
Yes I did that

1367
01:12:25,343 --> 01:12:26,111
I did that too

1368
01:12:26,367 --> 01:12:27,135
And I

1369
01:12:28,415 --> 01:12:32,511
I totally did.

1370
01:12:33,023 --> 01:12:35,839
Do you think these statements reflect poorly upon you as

1371
01:12:36,863 --> 01:12:40,703
Yeasty

1372
01:12:46,079 --> 01:12:48,639
This is just an incredibly weird ramble

1373
01:12:48,895 --> 01:12:49,663
The Gibson to like

1374
01:12:49,919 --> 01:12:54,015
Sales pitch in the middle but on committal about it cuz want to talk about

1375
01:12:54,271 --> 01:12:54,783
Spiritual issues

1376
01:12:55,295 --> 01:12:57,343
A little bit more than he wants to talk about sales

1377
01:12:57,599 --> 01:13:00,671
But those spiritual issues are in service of trying to make more sense

1378
01:13:00,927 --> 01:13:01,951
Just like Jesus said

1379
01:13:02,207 --> 01:13:06,303

Reach plateaus in Community Theater or whatever

1385
01:13:30,879 --> 01:13:32,671

1391
01:13:50,591 --> 01:13:51,871
But I've learned so much

1392
01:13:52,127 --> 01:13:54,943
And I feel very thrilled to have learned

1393
01:13:56,479 --> 01:13:59,039
To be on this Quest Alex let's see where you go from there

1394
01:13:59,807 --> 01:14:01,087
I'm not complaining but

1395

I'm seriously a lot older most Realty

1396
01:14:06,719 --> 01:14:07,231
I know

1397
01:14:08,767 --> 01:14:09,279
Sure

1398
01:14:10,047 --> 01:14:13,119
I remember things I see people doing I used to do

1399
01:14:13,375 --> 01:14:14,911
10 years ago 20 years ago

1400
01:14:15,167 --> 01:14:16,191
I remember back

1401
01:14:16,447 --> 01:14:17,471
I was like damn

1402
01:14:22,847 --> 01:14:23,871

I've done this so long I don't warn people I've done it so long

1406
01:14:40,511 --> 01:14:42,047
Become removed from it now

1407
01:14:43,583 --> 01:14:44,863

Sick part of me that doesn't want to come beg for your money which

Part of your body Alex

1463
01:17:54,559 --> 01:17:56,351
But in that case

1464
01:17:56,863 --> 01:17:58,399
The way he's framing it is

1465
01:17:58,911 --> 01:18:00,959
I don't want to convince you to give me money

1466
01:18:01,215 --> 01:18:07,359

Well it's what I

1469
01:18:11,967 --> 01:18:15,551
Flashback to is when I was in church one of the things they would always tell us

01:18:15,807 --> 01:18:16,575
In the youth group is like

1471
01:18:16,831 --> 01:18:19,647
If you don't if you don't feel close to God

1472
01:18:19,903 --> 01:18:21,695
You should pray to feel close to God

1473
01:18:22,207 --> 01:18:24,767
If you don't want to feel close to God you should

1474
01:18:25,023 --> 01:18:26,303
Pray to want to feel close

1475
01:18:26,559 --> 01:18:27,071

01:19:43,871 --> 01:19:50,015
Mountain

1503
01:19:50,271 --> 01:19:51,551
Bash your head

1504
01:19:51,807 --> 01:19:54,623
Hoping you can die and you're not going to be able to die

1505
01:19:54,879 --> 01:19:55,903
Thought is that a i

1506
01:19:56,927 --> 01:19:58,975
And you're going to beg for God to tell you

1507
01:20:00,255 --> 01:20:01,791
God's not going to kill you

1508
01:20:03,071 --> 01:20:04,351
Because you served

1509
01:20:05,119 --> 01:20:06,143
Seems like a weirdo

1510
01:20:06,911 --> 01:20:08,447
Seems like a weird

1511
01:20:09,727 --> 01:20:11,263
Darkness

1512
01:20:12,031 --> 01:20:14,080
Pray for God

1513
01:20:14,336 --> 01:20:14,848
Achillea

1514
01:20:15,104 --> 01:20:15,616
But no

1515
01:20:15,872 --> 01:20:17,920
Was full of love

1516
01:20:18,688 --> 01:20:19,968
He's more about torturing you

1517
01:20:20,224 --> 01:20:24,576
Fraternity

1518
01:20:24,832 --> 01:20:26,880
How to pay for multiple abortions

1519
01:20:27,136 --> 01:20:27,904
Calm down

1520
01:20:28,160 --> 01:20:29,440
Also like

1521
01:20:30,464 --> 01:20:32,000
It's the feeling that I get from that is

1522
01:20:34,304 --> 01:20:36,096
The ceiling to it

1523
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:41,472
Through certain extent

1524
01:20:41,728 --> 01:20:42,496
People think this is funny

1525
01:20:43,008 --> 01:20:48,384
I think it's because he has an awareness that like people laughing

1526
01:20:49,408 --> 01:20:50,432
Because he went

1527
01:20:50,688 --> 01:20:51,712
Right there is like

1528
01:20:54,272 --> 01:20:56,576
Robot

1529
01:20:56,832 --> 01:21:02,976
Everything all you think that's funny and you're like

1530
01:21:03,232 --> 01:21:03,744
Exist

1531
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:05,024
Like I don't want

1532
01:21:05,280 --> 01:21:06,048
To hifalutin

1533
01:21:06,304 --> 01:21:06,816
I'm here but

1534
01:21:07,072 --> 01:21:08,864
The fact that multiple Infowars

1535
01:21:09,120 --> 01:21:10,400
Employees started like

1536
01:21:10,912 --> 01:21:17,056
Retweet not retweeting but like saving tweets that I adore that uncle's guy responding to one of my

1537
01:21:17,312 --> 01:21:23,456
Jon rappoport followed us the other day so I think that there's some sort of an awareness

1538
01:21:23,712 --> 01:21:24,224
There might be

1539
01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:25,760
I can't say for sure

1540
01:21:26,016 --> 01:21:27,552
Explain why Alex

1541
01:21:27,808 --> 01:21:29,088
Like self-aware enough to know that

1542
01:21:29,344 --> 01:21:30,368
Some people

1543
01:21:30,880 --> 01:21:35,232
But also that could just be normal human self-awareness

1544
01:21:39,072 --> 01:21:40,352
AI robots

1545
01:21:40,608 --> 01:21:41,888
Everything that covers it

1546
01:21:48,032 --> 01:21:51,616
It looks just a couple months ago he was saying the chimeras are

1547
01:21:51,872 --> 01:21:53,408
That's the biggest thing

1548
01:21:53,920 --> 01:21:55,712
He's moved on to a i

1549
01:21:59,040 --> 01:22:00,320
Anyway

1550
01:22:02,112 --> 01:22:02,624
The Bold

1551
01:22:03,136 --> 01:22:03,648
Declaration

1552
01:22:06,464 --> 01:22:06,976
I don't believe

1553
01:22:07,744 --> 01:22:09,536
And all I say is buckle up

1554
01:22:20,288 --> 01:22:21,056
My soul

1555
01:22:22,080 --> 01:22:22,592
Headspace

1556
01:22:24,128 --> 01:22:25,408
Down just a little ways

1557
01:22:25,920 --> 01:22:27,456
This is going

1558
01:22:27,712 --> 01:22:29,248
Did you take a look

1559
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:31,296
Lowe's

1560
01:22:34,880 --> 01:22:35,904
Dresses

1561
01:22:39,488 --> 01:22:40,256
You don't want to go there

1562
01:22:40,768 --> 01:22:43,584
Okay

1563
01:22:44,096 --> 01:22:45,376
You know where it's going

1564
01:22:45,632 --> 01:22:46,144
Hell

1565
01:22:46,400 --> 01:22:47,680
You don't want to go there

1566
01:22:47,936 --> 01:22:48,704
We are going there

1567
01:22:49,216 --> 01:22:52,800
Apparently yeah.

1568
01:22:54,592 --> 01:22:55,360
Like

1569
01:22:55,616 --> 01:22:56,640
Where did the space jump

1570
01:22:57,152 --> 01:22:59,712
Are we talking about

1571
01:23:00,992 --> 01:23:02,784
Time and space

1572
01:23:05,344 --> 01:23:11,488
Right I don't know he's just a crazy person created an einstein-rosen Bridge

1573
01:23:11,744 --> 01:23:16,608
2050

1574
01:23:21,728 --> 01:23:23,776
You sold your soul time Jump

1575
01:23:24,032 --> 01:23:29,152
Coronavirus

1576
01:23:30,944 --> 01:23:32,736
If you'd like

1577
01:23:34,784 --> 01:23:35,808
Profound

1578
01:23:36,064 --> 01:23:37,856
Now why is it

1579
01:23:38,112 --> 01:23:39,904
Don't worry about it

1580
01:23:41,696 --> 01:23:45,024
Forgotten but you said he was going to go to Kohl's

1581
01:23:45,280 --> 01:23:49,632
So here's the beginning of rats

1582
01:23:51,168 --> 01:23:56,032
New York

1583
01:23:58,080 --> 01:24:02,432
Personal betrayal

1584
01:24:05,248 --> 01:24:06,528
Really humbling to see

1585
01:24:07,296 --> 01:24:10,624
I can tell you're you're you're a nice man and you hate it when people

1586
01:24:11,136 --> 01:24:12,928
Take advantage of you and do things

1587
01:24:13,696 --> 01:24:14,976
Are honorable

1588
01:24:15,232 --> 01:24:16,512
And you're just trying to help people

1589
01:24:17,024 --> 01:24:18,560
Well I appreciate that

1590
01:24:18,816 --> 01:24:22,144
It hurts me that there she'll phone

1591
01:24:22,656 --> 01:24:24,448
You p****

1592
01:24:25,728 --> 01:24:27,264
He had to because

1593
01:24:28,032 --> 01:24:28,544
He can't

1594
01:24:29,568 --> 01:24:31,616
Allow other people to feel bad for him

1595
01:24:32,128 --> 01:24:33,408
Actually

1596
01:24:33,664 --> 01:24:35,712
He listened to that and he heard somebody

1597
01:24:35,968 --> 01:24:36,736
Play listener

1598
01:24:38,016 --> 01:24:38,528
You all right

1599
01:24:38,784 --> 01:24:39,808
I feel bad

1600
01:24:40,064 --> 01:24:41,600
For you Alex Adele

1601
01:24:41,856 --> 01:24:45,952
You can't feel bad for me I feel great I always feel great I feel bad

1602
01:24:47,232 --> 01:24:49,792
So don't you feel bad for me hundred percent

1603
01:24:50,048 --> 01:24:50,816
For the bad guys

1604
01:24:51,072 --> 01:24:53,120
Fallen

1605
01:24:54,912 --> 01:24:57,216
Cowardly

1606
01:24:58,752 --> 01:25:00,032
Right that's what's underneath

1607
01:25:00,288 --> 01:25:03,360
I was watching this

1608
01:25:03,616 --> 01:25:06,432
In lifetime and then when I went back and watched it

1609
01:25:06,688 --> 01:25:08,224
To cut the clips and what have you

1610
01:25:08,480 --> 01:25:11,552
There's two things they're running parallel with the collars that are really into

1611
01:25:12,064 --> 01:25:12,832
There's a sale

1612
01:25:13,088 --> 01:25:15,904
Piece of it and I'll talk about that a little bit further down the road

1613
01:25:16,160 --> 01:25:17,440
But there's a b storyline

1614
01:25:18,976 --> 01:25:19,744
Can cry on air

1615
01:25:20,256 --> 01:25:21,792
You can feel it in him that like

1616
01:25:22,048 --> 01:25:24,096
There's so much that voice

1617
01:25:25,120 --> 01:25:28,704
He wants to go to a collar that says something that allows him to Launch

1618
01:25:28,960 --> 01:25:30,496
Into a rant that will make him

1619
01:25:30,752 --> 01:25:31,264
Can cry

1620
01:25:31,520 --> 01:25:33,312
Great television

1621
01:25:33,824 --> 01:25:38,944
But unfortunately Raptor man comes in with a pity party and he knows that if he cries from

1622
01:25:39,200 --> 01:25:39,712
He's weak

1623
01:25:39,968 --> 01:25:40,480
Week

1624
01:25:40,736 --> 01:25:44,576
He can't show asked his audience and then there's another caller later

1625
01:25:44,832 --> 01:25:46,624
Who does the same thing and you can tell

1626
01:25:47,392 --> 01:25:48,928
You and I will see it in his face looks like

1627
01:25:52,512 --> 01:25:54,048
Deepfake emotion

1628
01:25:54,304 --> 01:25:56,864
And you are only giving me a motion that is weak

1629
01:25:57,376 --> 01:25:59,168
Frustrating for him

1630
01:26:00,960 --> 01:26:01,728
Takes a turn for the

1631
01:26:01,984 --> 01:26:03,008
Realize

1632
01:26:04,288 --> 01:26:05,056
It's not good

1633
01:26:05,568 --> 01:26:06,592
Well we know

1634
01:26:06,848 --> 01:26:08,128
We know there

1635
01:26:08,896 --> 01:26:12,736
Good people with every race color creed when others bloodlines

1636
01:26:14,016 --> 01:26:14,784
To focus on

1637
01:26:15,040 --> 01:26:19,392
Because the enemy fears those Bloodlines if those people were

1638
01:26:19,648 --> 01:26:21,440
Actually stand up and do what they were

1639
01:26:21,696 --> 01:26:22,720
Full potential

1640
01:26:22,976 --> 01:26:24,256
What is 1

1641
01:26:24,512 --> 01:26:26,048
Help for Humanity.

1642
01:26:26,816 --> 01:26:29,120
I think those those people are targeted

1643
01:26:29,376 --> 01:26:30,656
Because of their potential

1644
01:26:31,168 --> 01:26:33,728
And it's a very very sad things we have to grieve

1645
01:26:34,240 --> 01:26:36,800
We have to grieve for them and I'm just understand that

1646
01:26:40,384 --> 01:26:43,200
What they see in US is a projection of themselves

1647
01:26:43,712 --> 01:26:44,736
What the f***

1648
01:26:46,016 --> 01:26:48,320
They're afraid of certain bloodline

1649
01:26:48,832 --> 01:26:53,184
The Illuminati I guess or the powers-that-be the new world order

1650
01:26:53,440 --> 01:26:54,208
Car gets hurt

1651
01:26:54,464 --> 01:26:54,976
Bloodline

1652
01:26:55,488 --> 01:26:57,536
Because they're afraid of their potential

1653
01:26:59,328 --> 01:27:01,120
Like what

1654
01:27:01,632 --> 01:27:03,680
We're going

1655
01:27:03,936 --> 01:27:05,216
That's what we're talking about here

1656
01:27:05,472 --> 01:27:07,264
Save setting that up

1657
01:27:07,520 --> 01:27:09,312
There's good people in all Races

1658
01:27:09,568 --> 01:27:10,080
His collars

1659
01:27:10,336 --> 01:27:16,480
Bloodline

1660
01:27:16,736 --> 01:27:17,248
Flip

1661
01:27:18,272 --> 01:27:19,552
Clear

1662
01:27:19,808 --> 01:27:20,832
Buy bloodline

1663
01:27:21,600 --> 01:27:22,368
Talking about

1664
01:27:22,880 --> 01:27:23,392
Race

1665
01:27:23,648 --> 01:27:27,232
Ethnic origin and that sort of thing

1666
01:27:27,488 --> 01:27:28,000
He's talking about

1667
01:27:29,536 --> 01:27:30,048
Nailed it

1668
01:27:32,352 --> 01:27:33,120
I don't think

1669
01:27:35,936 --> 01:27:36,704
I just think

1670
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:38,240
Certain races are better

1671
01:27:38,752 --> 01:27:43,616
Races are so good they have been held down by my imaginary enemy exactly

1672
01:27:44,128 --> 01:27:45,408
Yeah like mine

1673
01:27:47,200 --> 01:27:47,712
I

1674
01:27:47,968 --> 01:27:50,272
Confederate royalty

1675
01:27:50,528 --> 01:27:53,344
There's no doubt about that

1676
01:27:54,880 --> 01:27:55,392
They have

1677
01:27:55,648 --> 01:27:56,928
Held my bloodline

1678
01:27:57,184 --> 01:27:58,976
All my dad is is a dentist

1679
01:28:04,608 --> 01:28:05,632
Bullion qualified

1680
01:28:05,888 --> 01:28:07,424
Bhr

1681
01:28:09,472 --> 01:28:11,264
What is this is nepotism

1682
01:28:11,520 --> 01:28:12,288
Hibbett

1683
01:28:12,544 --> 01:28:18,688
Head of HR is not like an entry-level position

1684
01:28:18,944 --> 01:28:23,552
What are you doing

1685
01:28:26,368 --> 01:28:27,392
You just a head of HR

1686
01:28:28,160 --> 01:28:29,696
I'll probably just there to take cover

1687
01:28:29,952 --> 01:28:34,304
Cover for action

1688
01:28:34,560 --> 01:28:38,400
Did all the crimes every good run

1689
01:28:38,656 --> 01:28:39,168
To come to an end

1690
01:28:39,424 --> 01:28:43,520
For a while

1691
01:28:43,776 --> 01:28:44,288
4 guys

1692
01:28:44,544 --> 01:28:46,336
Alex Jones.

1693
01:28:55,040 --> 01:28:59,648
I feel bad when I see people little kids trash cans in Venezuela

1694
01:29:00,416 --> 01:29:03,232
I know they've got thousands every week Donna starvation

1695
01:29:04,768 --> 01:29:07,584
You think I'll go look at those Hispanic people down there

1696
01:29:07,840 --> 01:29:10,144
CDOT traffic another Venezuela

1697
01:29:11,168 --> 01:29:12,960
I'm Alex Jones I'm a big guy

1698
01:29:13,216 --> 01:29:16,032
This is so close to Andy Daly's Dom dimello

1699
01:29:16,288 --> 01:29:18,592
Like this kind of voice

1700
01:29:19,104 --> 01:29:19,872
Gross

1701
01:29:20,128 --> 01:29:20,640
The girls

1702
01:29:23,712 --> 01:29:24,480
Sparrows

1703
01:29:26,528 --> 01:29:28,320
It's damn close

1704
01:29:28,832 --> 01:29:29,856
Better than

1705
01:29:30,368 --> 01:29:32,672
She told me that satanic let me tell you

1706
01:29:33,184 --> 01:29:33,952
The people

1707
01:29:34,464 --> 01:29:36,256
Go to the people that run those countries

1708
01:29:37,280 --> 01:29:39,840
I drop by their limousine to their helicopter

1709
01:29:40,352 --> 01:29:43,936
See those families eating their garbage it makes them feel real bad

1710
01:29:44,448 --> 01:29:46,240
Makes me want to do

1711
01:29:46,752 --> 01:29:47,776
Throat

1712
01:29:50,848 --> 01:29:53,920
Going to kill those kids

1713
01:29:54,176 --> 01:29:55,456
0 crops

1714
01:29:55,712 --> 01:29:57,504
Sure about pre-market

1715
01:29:57,760 --> 01:29:59,808
Renaissance

1716
01:30:02,624 --> 01:30:07,232
Years ago with his riches of us per capita the average

1717
01:30:07,488 --> 01:30:09,280
Venezuelan citizen

1718
01:30:09,536 --> 01:30:11,840
Was making as much as a US citizen

1719
01:30:12,096 --> 01:30:12,608
Look it up

1720
01:30:13,120 --> 01:30:14,144
They were on par

1721
01:30:14,656 --> 01:30:16,960
In the 1970s and 60s or the US

1722
01:30:17,728 --> 01:30:21,312
I guess it was about the US and Venezuela it was Argentina

1723
01:30:23,104 --> 01:30:25,664
Sad big slick New York bags come in

1724
01:30:28,224 --> 01:30:31,296
Addition on a run stuff can teach you how to be socialist

1725
01:30:32,064 --> 01:30:38,208
The be slick New York Banks socialism

1726
01:30:38,464 --> 01:30:39,488
Socialism

1727
01:30:40,256 --> 01:30:43,072
Don't talk to you a little bit about Goldman Sachs

1728
01:30:43,328 --> 01:30:45,632
Nobody is bigger into socialism than them

1729
01:30:45,888 --> 01:30:49,984
I want to talk to you a little bit about Venezuela because I think the way that Alex Jones speaks about

1730
01:30:50,240 --> 01:30:53,056
Situation there is really disgusting and degraded

1731
01:30:53,568 --> 01:30:54,080
He was

1732
01:30:54,336 --> 01:31:00,480
Was he trying to talk about how in Venezuela they shared foil

1733
01:31:02,272 --> 01:31:04,576
Subway

1734
01:31:04,832 --> 01:31:05,600
That was later

1735
01:31:05,856 --> 01:31:08,672
What's the

1736
01:31:09,952 --> 01:31:10,976
Nationalized

1737
01:31:11,232 --> 01:31:12,256
That was after like

1738
01:31:12,768 --> 01:31:13,280
76

1739
01:31:15,072 --> 01:31:17,632
This is from the website called the Venezuela analysis

1740
01:31:19,168 --> 01:31:20,448
Lot of research into

1741
01:31:20,704 --> 01:31:21,216
Cultural

1742
01:31:21,472 --> 01:31:23,264
Historical aspects of Venezuela

1743
01:31:23,776 --> 01:31:26,080
Going to read some of this as a quote

1744
01:31:26,336 --> 01:31:27,872
Venezuelan Allison

1745
01:31:28,640 --> 01:31:29,664
That's a good that I could do

1746
01:31:29,920 --> 01:31:30,688
Portmanteau

1747
01:31:31,456 --> 01:31:34,272
It was not until 1912 that the first oil well was drilled

1748
01:31:34,528 --> 01:31:36,320
Shortly thereafter first

1749
01:31:36,576 --> 01:31:38,368
First Royal Dutch Shell and then

1750
01:31:38,624 --> 01:31:41,440
Standard Oil became major producers of oil in Venezuela

1751
01:31:41,952 --> 01:31:47,328
Within a few years by 1929 Venezuela was the world's second-largest oil producer after the United States

1752
01:31:47,584 --> 01:31:49,376
At world's largest oil exporter

1753
01:31:49,888 --> 01:31:52,960
Between 1920 and 1935 oil

1754
01:31:53,216 --> 01:31:54,240
Percent

1755
01:31:54,496 --> 01:31:56,032
To 91.2%

1756
01:31:56,544 --> 01:31:59,616
This of course had an immediate and dramatic impact on the country

1757
01:31:59,872 --> 01:32:00,384
Economy

1758
01:32:00,640 --> 01:32:01,920
Known among Economist as

1759
01:32:02,176 --> 01:32:02,688
The Dutch disease

1760
01:32:03,456 --> 01:32:06,528
The most important consequence of these was the agricultural

1761
01:32:06,784 --> 01:32:08,064
The agricultural production

1762
01:32:08,320 --> 01:32:09,344
Decline to almost nothing

1763
01:32:09,856 --> 01:32:11,648
The country fell behind in industrialized

1764
01:32:12,928 --> 01:32:13,440
American country

1765
01:32:14,208 --> 01:32:15,744
By the definition of

1766
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:17,024
Disease explanation

1767
01:32:17,792 --> 01:32:19,328
An economic disease

1768
01:32:19,584 --> 01:32:20,608
Get this economic disease

1769
01:32:20,864 --> 01:32:22,144
Just caught whenever commodities

1770
01:32:22,400 --> 01:32:24,960
One sector of the economy

1771
01:32:25,472 --> 01:32:26,240
Which is not match

1772
01:32:26,496 --> 01:32:27,008
Despite increased

1773
01:32:27,264 --> 01:32:28,032
Incoming other sect

1774
01:32:29,312 --> 01:32:29,824
What happened

1775
01:32:30,080 --> 01:32:32,384
Is Addison sectoral

1776
01:32:32,640 --> 01:32:33,152
Increase

1777
01:32:33,408 --> 01:32:35,456
Causes several products

1778
01:32:35,968 --> 01:32:36,480
Any other side

1779
01:32:37,504 --> 01:32:39,296
The increase sectoral income causes

1780
01:32:39,552 --> 01:32:40,832
Distorted growth and services

1781
01:32:41,088 --> 01:32:42,112
And other non-tradable

1782
01:32:42,368 --> 01:32:45,184
Balls which cannot be imported while discouraging the

1783
01:32:45,440 --> 01:32:45,952
Tradable

1784
01:32:47,488 --> 01:32:48,768
The reason for this disparity

1785
01:32:49,024 --> 01:32:51,328
Is that the great economic greater

1786
01:32:51,840 --> 01:32:54,400
The greater income rapidly raises the

1787
01:32:54,656 --> 01:32:55,424
The demand for imports

1788
01:32:55,680 --> 01:32:56,704
Since domestic production

1789
01:32:57,728 --> 01:32:59,008
Father demands quickly enough

1790
01:32:59,264 --> 01:33:01,312
It also raises the demand for services

1791
01:33:01,568 --> 01:33:02,848
Which of the domestic Market has to

1792
01:33:06,688 --> 01:33:09,248
The increased demand for imported goods and domestic service

1793
01:33:09,760 --> 01:33:10,784
Call Danny

1794
01:33:11,040 --> 01:33:11,808
Increase in prices

1795
01:33:12,064 --> 01:33:13,856
With articles domestic production

1796
01:33:14,112 --> 01:33:15,136
Increase

1797
01:33:15,648 --> 01:33:18,720
Because the flow of Foreign Exchange into the economy has caused a greater in

1798
01:33:18,976 --> 01:33:20,256
Inflation of wages and pray

1799
01:33:22,560 --> 01:33:23,840
Itzy

1800
01:33:25,376 --> 01:33:25,888
What is it

1801
01:33:26,144 --> 01:33:28,192
Douglas Adams it was the the shoe point

1802
01:33:28,448 --> 01:33:29,728
Right you have

1803
01:33:30,240 --> 01:33:36,128
An economy suddenly starts making a lot of shoes everybody wants shoes all the time so then people start making more shoes

1804
01:33:36,384 --> 01:33:38,176
Everybody starts their own shoe store

1805
01:33:38,432 --> 01:33:39,200
Then you forget

1806
01:33:39,456 --> 01:33:40,480
We don't have groceries

1807
01:33:40,736 --> 01:33:42,528
And their agricultural production

1808
01:33:42,784 --> 01:33:43,808
It becomes almost nothing

1809
01:33:44,064 --> 01:33:44,832
Exactly

1810
01:33:45,088 --> 01:33:46,624
We continually increasing oil in

1811
01:33:47,136 --> 01:33:48,672
Reliance

1812
01:33:48,928 --> 01:33:49,696
In Venezuela

1813
01:33:49,952 --> 01:33:51,232
On this source of income

1814
01:33:51,488 --> 01:33:53,024
In lieu of individual income tax

1815
01:33:56,096 --> 01:33:56,608
Mystery Begins

1816
01:33:56,864 --> 01:33:58,400
Began to feel the effects of the oversupply

1817
01:33:59,680 --> 01:34:01,984
Especially following the increase production of oil in the Middle East

1818
01:34:02,496 --> 01:34:05,056
And the imposition of import quotas on the United States

1819
01:34:05,568 --> 01:34:06,080
The consequence

1820
01:34:06,592 --> 01:34:07,872
Tropically low oil price

1821
01:34:08,640 --> 01:34:11,456
In 1973 there was a middle east oil embargo

1822
01:34:11,712 --> 01:34:16,320
Which lights are the revenues of Venezuela's oil sales quadrupling from 1970s

1823
01:34:16,576 --> 01:34:17,344
1974

1824
01:34:17,600 --> 01:34:19,136
Newly elected president Carlos and

1825
01:34:19,392 --> 01:34:20,672
Andrea Perez

1826
01:34:20,928 --> 01:34:22,720
Intended to use the vast explosion of money

1827
01:34:22,976 --> 01:34:23,744
I need to fight poverty

1828
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:25,536
And diversify the economy through

1829
01:34:25,792 --> 01:34:26,304
Import Subs

1830
01:34:26,560 --> 01:34:27,072
Kitchen

1831
01:34:27,328 --> 01:34:29,632
This had a good effect for a while but in the midnight

1832
01:34:29,888 --> 01:34:31,424
80s price.of.oil crashed

1833
01:34:32,704 --> 01:34:34,752
$3.19 a barrel

1834
01:34:37,056 --> 01:34:43,200
Well agricultural production made up 1/3 of Venezuela GDP in the 1920s than 110

1835
01:34:43,456 --> 01:34:44,224
10th by the 1950

1836
01:34:44,736 --> 01:34:46,784
Jesus hurt agriculture makes up about

1837
01:34:47,296 --> 01:34:47,808
6%

1838
01:34:48,064 --> 01:34:49,088
Venezuela

1839
01:34:50,112 --> 01:34:51,904
In addition to the Dutch disease problem

1840
01:34:52,160 --> 01:34:54,720
The sudden increase of oil revenues in Venezuela caused

1841
01:34:54,976 --> 01:34:56,000
The Furious problem in the

1842
01:34:56,256 --> 01:34:56,768
Fiscal

1843
01:34:57,536 --> 01:35:03,680
That is the new revenues called the illusion that the oil income could be used industrialized the country via massive

1844
01:35:03,936 --> 01:35:04,704
Infrastructure projects

1845
01:35:05,216 --> 01:35:06,496
Do so the oil

1846
01:35:06,752 --> 01:35:07,776
As the president

1847
01:35:08,032 --> 01:35:10,592
At the time of the oil boom Carlos Andres Perez

1848
01:35:11,616 --> 01:35:12,128
What happened

1849
01:35:12,640 --> 01:35:18,272
Was that the quadrupled government income cause government spending to quickly increase it even surpass the new-found revenue

1850
01:35:18,784 --> 01:35:19,552
When the oil income

1851
01:35:21,088 --> 01:35:21,600
It was not a z

1852
01:35:21,856 --> 01:35:24,416
Easy to reduce government spending as it had been to increase

1853
01:35:24,928 --> 01:35:26,720
The result was the government

1854
01:35:26,976 --> 01:35:30,560
Yeah the result was that the government gradually went deeper and deeper into debt

1855
01:35:30,816 --> 01:35:34,656
Between 1970 and 1990 for foreign debt Rose from 9% to

1856
01:35:35,168 --> 01:35:35,680
3% of

1857
01:35:36,960 --> 01:35:37,728
So what

1858
01:35:37,984 --> 01:35:40,032
The reason that Venezuela is devastated

1859
01:35:40,288 --> 01:35:41,312
Is partially mismanagement

1860
01:35:41,824 --> 01:35:42,592
Partially

1861
01:35:42,848 --> 01:35:43,360
Like

1862
01:35:44,384 --> 01:35:45,152
You know some problems

1863
01:35:47,456 --> 01:35:47,968
Necessarily

1864
01:35:48,224 --> 01:35:49,760
But the cause of all of it

1865
01:35:50,016 --> 01:35:51,040
Is

1866
01:35:51,296 --> 01:35:54,624
Well you can you can still fight that way if you want

1867
01:35:54,880 --> 01:35:56,672
But it is this Dutch disease idea

1868
01:35:56,928 --> 01:35:57,952
Where their economy

1869
01:35:58,208 --> 01:36:04,352
Was solely reliant on oil is solely reliant on the fluctuations in

1870
01:36:04,608 --> 01:36:06,400
Price of one particular commodity

1871
01:36:08,192 --> 01:36:08,960
Is also going to

1872
01:36:09,472 --> 01:36:10,240
Just as

1873
01:36:10,496 --> 01:36:11,008
Fluctuated

1874
01:36:11,264 --> 01:36:14,848
He's going to as you can see from the way the Venezuela has

1875
01:36:15,360 --> 01:36:16,384
I had so many f******

1876
01:36:17,920 --> 01:36:22,272
Coups and Revolutions in all this stuff over and over again is because

1877
01:36:22,528 --> 01:36:24,064
Ultimately your economy is

1878
01:36:24,576 --> 01:36:27,904
It's going well it's really just masking how f***** it

1879
01:36:28,928 --> 01:36:30,208
That's what was happening in the six

1880
01:36:30,720 --> 01:36:33,536
Quadrupling of income from oil

1881
01:36:35,840 --> 01:36:36,352
The average

1882
01:36:36,608 --> 01:36:37,376
GDP being

1883
01:36:41,216 --> 01:36:43,008
The people who were making a shitload of money

1884
01:36:43,264 --> 01:36:43,776
Loyal

1885
01:36:44,032 --> 01:36:46,336
Inflate the appearance of the economy

1886
01:36:46,592 --> 01:36:48,128
Would you look at it

1887
01:36:50,176 --> 01:36:53,248
I think that the situation is far more complicated than even I person

1888
01:36:59,904 --> 01:37:01,184
It's still trying to work it out

1889
01:37:01,696 --> 01:37:02,464
Is because

1890
01:37:02,720 --> 01:37:03,488
Of that.

1891
01:37:07,072 --> 01:37:09,632
This is what happened

1892
01:37:10,144 --> 01:37:12,192
It's there's much more complicated ecosystem

1893
01:37:13,472 --> 01:37:15,008
That's what happens with

1894
01:37:15,264 --> 01:37:15,776
Capitalism

1895
01:37:16,032 --> 01:37:18,080
Literally right score

1896
01:37:18,592 --> 01:37:20,640
Capitals win and destroyed

1897
01:37:20,896 --> 01:37:21,408
Bright

1898
01:37:24,224 --> 01:37:24,992
The free market

1899
01:37:25,248 --> 01:37:26,016

1901
01:37:29,600 --> 01:37:31,904
And once again we see indications

1902
01:37:35,232 --> 01:37:37,536
AR

1903
01:37:50,848 --> 01:37:51,872
How old is Darren

01:37:54,176 --> 01:37:54,688
Break

1906
01:37:55,712 --> 01:37:58,272
Maybe we're not meant to be

1907
01:37:58,528 --> 01:37:59,296
You know what

1908
01:38:02,368 --> 01:38:03,648
We got 50% off

1909
01:38:05,440 --> 01:38:05,952
Baby Bop

Bathwater

1912
01:38:25,152 --> 01:38:26,432
I'm going to chew on a lot

1913
01:38:26,688 --> 01:38:28,992
So I thought I might roll over my eyes go up

1914
01:38:30,272 --> 01:38:33,088
Call me racist

1915
01:38:33,344 --> 01:38:34,112
I don't want to die

1916
01:38:34,880 --> 01:38:36,416
Is that why I want to die

1917
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:40,768
Kill you

1918
01:38:41,792 --> 01:38:44,096
Anytime

1919
01:38:44,352 --> 01:38:45,888
I realize they're dead already

1920
01:38:46,912 --> 01:38:48,704
Join us won't kill you.

1921
01:38:48,960 --> 01:38:50,496
You're dead already

1922
01:38:53,568 --> 01:38:54,848
Sleeping

1923
01:39:00,224 --> 01:39:03,296
No that's okay my ancestor your dad I'm not yet

1924
01:39:03,808 --> 01:39:04,320
So

1925
01:39:04,576 --> 01:39:05,088
Okay

1926
01:39:08,160 --> 01:39:09,440
That I'm creating in my head

1927
01:39:11,488 --> 01:39:17,632
Understand the mindset of the people he thinks he's talking about in the mindset

1928
01:39:20,960 --> 01:39:23,520
I understand the mindset of the people

1929
01:39:23,776 --> 01:39:27,360
Are his enemies his fake enemies because it's the mindset of

1930
01:39:27,616 --> 01:39:29,664
Many classical Victaulic villains

1931
01:39:29,920 --> 01:39:36,064
From film tropes of literature

1932
01:39:37,088 --> 01:39:38,880
I get that I seen

1933
01:39:39,392 --> 01:39:40,928
But like

1934
01:39:41,184 --> 01:39:43,488
The guy understand the mind

1935
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:50,144
He's just describing plot holes

1936
01:39:50,400 --> 01:39:53,216
Tired

1937
01:39:53,728 --> 01:39:56,288
If you don't scream

1938
01:39:57,312 --> 01:39:57,824
It's weird

1939
01:39:58,080 --> 01:40:00,896
Idea it is much more difficult to try and wrestle with like

1940
01:40:01,152 --> 01:40:02,432
What is the mindset of the

1941
01:40:02,688 --> 01:40:06,016
The person who created

1942
01:40:06,528 --> 01:40:07,808
Just so you can make money

1943
01:40:08,064 --> 01:40:08,576
I guess

1944
01:40:09,600 --> 01:40:11,392
I don't end that's why they called braces

1945
01:40:17,280 --> 01:40:17,792
The caller

1946
01:40:18,048 --> 01:40:18,560

1949
01:40:23,936 --> 01:40:24,960
Heard a caller

1950
01:40:25,216 --> 01:40:25,984
Whose voice

1951
01:40:26,240 --> 01:40:28,800
More matches what they say they're up to

1952
01:40:29,056 --> 01:40:31,104

1965
01:41:28,192 --> 01:41:28,960
Member of the NRA

1966
01:41:29,216 --> 01:41:33,568

Some

1972
01:41:50,464 --> 01:41:56,608
I called that perfectly though

Always clear

1974
01:41:58,912 --> 01:41:59,936
Immediately clear

1975
01:42:01,472 --> 01:42:06,336
Is that not a proton voice he's just created for himself

1976
01:42:06,592 --> 01:42:10,432
That guy was born to run for Congress as a Republican

1977
01:42:10,688 --> 01:42:12,736
That guy was a chimera

1978
01:42:12,992 --> 01:42:13,760
Is living is true

1979
01:42:14,272 --> 01:42:18,368
I want you to not talk over really quick

1980
01:42:18,624 --> 01:42:20,416
It's not

1981
01:42:20,672 --> 01:42:22,976
But I want it I want you to listen to Robert

1982
01:42:23,232 --> 01:42:24,512
The guys running for congress

1983
01:42:24,768 --> 01:42:26,816
I thought he was going to go away real quick

1984
01:42:27,072 --> 01:42:30,400
But I just want I want to interrupt

1985
01:42:30,912 --> 01:42:33,728
It's interesting to listen to him say he doesn't categorized

1986
01:42:33,984 --> 01:42:35,520
People

1987
01:42:35,776 --> 01:42:36,544
Categorize people

1988
01:42:36,800 --> 01:42:38,336
It's an invalid

1989
01:42:39,104 --> 01:42:40,640
It's fascinating within the same thing

1990
01:42:40,896 --> 01:42:41,408
Yeah

1991
01:42:42,176 --> 01:42:43,456

1992
01:42:44,992 --> 01:42:46,272
Polite about it

1993
01:42:46,528 --> 01:42:47,552
It is so

1994
01:42:47,808 --> 01:42:49,088
Disgusting

1995
01:42:54,464 --> 01:42:56,512

1996
01:42:59,328 --> 01:43:03,936

Do not know anything about this guy and I would never get along with

2025

Just by listening to him you got to go like I hear that boys would like

Which way was he going to be categorized

2033
01:45:19,360 --> 01:45:20,384
Anthony's just

2034
01:45:20,640 --> 01:45:23,200
Transphobic

Important

2037
01:45:25,760 --> 01:45:26,272
What's going on

2038
01:45:27,808 --> 01:45:28,576
Also what is

2039
01:45:28,832 --> 01:45:29,600
He think

2040
01:45:29,856 --> 01:45:31,648
He thinks she's actually saying

2041
01:45:31,904 --> 01:45:33,184
Whenever he's talking about

2042
01:45:33,440 --> 01:45:36,512
Transsexual woman

2043
01:45:36,768 --> 01:45:37,536
Leading the women

2044
01:45:38,816 --> 01:45:40,096
Text

2045
01:45:40,608 --> 01:45:45,216
That's the Pied Piper thing for him I think

2046
01:45:45,472 --> 01:45:46,752
Bright

2047
01:45:47,264 --> 01:45:48,800
By removing his own

2048
01:45:49,312 --> 01:45:49,824
Wow

2049
01:45:50,080 --> 01:45:51,104

Yeah well that's true

2051
01:45:52,640 --> 01:45:55,200
Scenario Alex

2052
01:45:57,248 --> 01:45:58,272
From what I understand

2053
01:45:59,040 --> 01:46:01,088
That is insane

2054
01:46:02,112 --> 01:46:03,648
Because the man is

2055
01:46:06,208 --> 01:46:08,512
He would be a trans exclusionary feminist

2056
01:46:08,768 --> 01:46:10,048
If you was effeminate

2057
01:46:10,560 --> 01:46:11,072
Either

2058
01:46:11,328 --> 01:46:13,632
Trans exclusionary misogynist

2059
01:46:14,912 --> 01:46:15,424
I guess

2060
01:46:15,680 --> 01:46:19,008
I don't know

2061
01:46:19,264 --> 01:46:21,056
I thought

2062
01:46:22,336 --> 01:46:23,104

2063
01:46:23,360 --> 01:46:25,408

It's the point where he's at

2068
01:46:35,904 --> 01:46:36,416
Can't get drunk enough

2069
01:46:37,952 --> 01:46:40,000
I want to go forward

2070
01:46:40,512 --> 01:46:41,792
I'm scared we're not going to make it

2071
01:46:42,816 --> 01:46:45,376

I just love this

2083
01:47:26,336 --> 01:47:27,104
I got to go to bed

2084
01:47:29,408 --> 01:47:31,712
6 Cozumel

2085

We're going to go to the Stars

2086
01:47:35,296 --> 01:47:35,808
It's written

2087
01:47:36,064 --> 01:47:36,832
On our flag

2088
01:47:37,088 --> 01:47:38,368
Rob to call me an Uber

2089
01:47:40,160 --> 01:47:43,488
Who wrote it on the flag tell me who wrote

2090
01:47:45,024 --> 01:47:48,864
He's just at this point today I think manifesting and intense

2091
01:47:49,120 --> 01:47:50,400
Frustration that none of these callers

2092
01:47:50,656 --> 01:47:52,704
They're giving him what he needs

2093
01:47:52,960 --> 01:47:53,472
Just cry

2094
01:47:53,728 --> 01:47:55,264
It goes onto another call

2095
01:47:56,800 --> 01:47:58,080
Does not succeed in making it look

2096
01:48:00,640 --> 01:48:01,664
Because it would make him look weak

2097
01:48:01,920 --> 01:48:03,200
The way she's presenting

2098
01:48:03,456 --> 01:48:07,552
Normally should get you into an emotional state emotion

2099
01:48:08,320 --> 01:48:10,368
Start with Judy in Florida

2100
01:48:10,624 --> 01:48:11,904
Girly everything for all the go-ahead

2101
01:48:13,440 --> 01:48:13,952
Hey Alex

2102
01:48:14,208 --> 01:48:19,072
It's good to talk to you again are you looking at you earlier on

2103
01:48:20,096 --> 01:48:25,728
And I never seen you look so sad and tired and I know you're very tired

2104
01:48:25,984 --> 01:48:27,776
With all the work that you're doing

2105
01:48:30,080 --> 01:48:34,176
First off I love you products

2106
01:48:34,944 --> 01:48:37,248
Because of the attack

2107
01:48:37,760 --> 01:48:42,880
Sure at this point far out was

2108
01:48:44,672 --> 01:48:47,232
At this point far out was trolling the chat room

2109
01:48:47,488 --> 01:48:50,048
He's not tired he's drunk

2110
01:48:51,072 --> 01:48:53,632
I met a couple people were like no he's really tired

2111
01:48:54,144 --> 01:48:55,168
But a lot of people

2112
01:48:55,424 --> 01:48:58,496
Started jumping in

2113
01:48:58,752 --> 01:49:02,080
And what I realized there's one or two options because I did this later in the

2114
01:49:02,592 --> 01:49:04,896
I was bored so I started

2115
01:49:05,408 --> 01:49:06,432
I was during Harris

2116
01:49:06,688 --> 01:49:08,480
Some Smith's part as like this

2117
01:49:08,736 --> 01:49:09,504
So boring

2118
01:49:09,760 --> 01:49:11,296
Write a bunch of accounts started

2119
01:49:11,552 --> 01:49:14,368
Chiming in like you doing

2120
01:49:14,624 --> 01:49:16,160
Alex is trying to put us to sleep

2121
01:49:16,416 --> 01:49:20,768
And I got a lot of people to jump on board with

2122
01:49:21,024 --> 01:49:24,352
And the same thing happened when far-right was doing lead this guy is drunk

2123
01:49:24,608 --> 01:49:26,656
Check it made me realize one of two things

2124
01:49:26,912 --> 01:49:27,424
X1

2125
01:49:28,704 --> 01:49:33,568
Is people listening there's a lot of people who are watching it in the same Spirit watching

2126
01:49:33,824 --> 01:49:36,128
Just waiting for a leader to jump in

2127
01:49:36,384 --> 01:49:38,688
Aunt be like

2128
01:49:39,968 --> 01:49:40,992
A lot of people are Bots

2129
01:49:41,504 --> 01:49:44,064
Mirroring whatever what they,

2130
01:49:44,576 --> 01:49:45,856
Just reiterating

2131
01:49:46,112 --> 01:49:47,136
Or like using

2132
01:49:47,392 --> 01:49:48,672
Using the idea

2133
01:49:48,928 --> 01:49:49,952
And making simple sentences

2134
01:49:50,208 --> 01:49:50,976
Is based on it in

2135
01:49:51,488 --> 01:49:52,512
Forget be like chatbot

2136
01:49:53,792 --> 01:49:57,632
Or they could just be in for listeners who are

2137
01:49:58,144 --> 01:50:04,288
Matagorda follow literally any leader see that's the other thing I thought about it and it's like everyone is so f******

2138
01:50:04,544 --> 01:50:05,056
Malleable

2139
01:50:05,312 --> 01:50:06,080
Or it's

2140
01:50:09,152 --> 01:50:10,944
It was a sort of thing that I could see definite

2141
01:50:11,456 --> 01:50:13,248
Yeah but that is not

2142
01:50:13,504 --> 01:50:15,296
Disqualifier for irregular Infowars

2143
01:50:17,088 --> 01:50:19,392
I don't know the other thing I was crazy was it's like

2144
01:50:19,648 --> 01:50:25,024
People engaging with like he's drunk no he's not like a little bit of that

2145
01:50:25,280 --> 01:50:27,072
Writing a essay about gnosticism

2146
01:50:32,704 --> 01:50:33,984
Project Camelot

2147
01:50:35,264 --> 01:50:36,288
I better go over to this one

2148
01:50:36,544 --> 01:50:37,824
Write about gnosticism

2149
01:50:39,872 --> 01:50:40,640
At this point Alex

2150
01:50:41,152 --> 01:50:41,920
Isn't such a bad head

2151
01:50:42,176 --> 01:50:43,712
Headspace

2152
01:50:48,320 --> 01:50:54,464
I told you already

2153
01:50:56,768 --> 01:51:00,096
Wherever God doesn't hear me

2154
01:51:00,608 --> 01:51:02,400
That's why

2155
01:51:03,680 --> 01:51:06,496
But I'm not perfect I love problem just please

2156
01:51:07,008 --> 01:51:09,824
Just don't let them get me I don't want to be with them please

2157
01:51:11,104 --> 01:51:11,616
What's your choice

2158
01:51:12,128 --> 01:51:18,272
But I don't think you have anything to fear I mean my son and I are staying and I have a daughter that lives

2159
01:51:18,784 --> 01:51:20,576
McDonald's

2160
01:51:20,832 --> 01:51:23,648
I love her husband

2161
01:51:24,160 --> 01:51:26,976
He's very much a

2162
01:51:27,232 --> 01:51:27,744
Trapanese

2163
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:31,584
Scottish guy because he is but he's like a silly boy

2164
01:51:34,144 --> 01:51:37,472
And I'm not going to be the one to reach her but you know I've got does

2165
01:51:37,984 --> 01:51:40,800
The people praying for her because I really believe

2166
01:51:41,312 --> 01:51:44,896
What was happening in Israel I believe

2167
01:51:45,152 --> 01:51:45,664
Like

2168
01:51:46,176 --> 01:51:48,992
Behold on the world

2169
01:51:51,296 --> 01:51:51,808
It's intense

2170
01:51:52,064 --> 01:51:52,576
Sublime

2171
01:51:53,344 --> 01:51:54,624
Like your son-in-law

2172
01:51:57,696 --> 01:52:01,792
I'm so I don't know if we ever really talked about it

2173
01:52:02,048 --> 01:52:07,168
Paul Joseph Watson made a video like a couple months back where he was misusing science

2174
01:52:10,752 --> 01:52:11,264
For feminizing

2175
01:52:11,776 --> 01:52:12,544
Outerstuff so

2176
01:52:12,800 --> 01:52:14,080
He drew a bunch of

2177
01:52:14,336 --> 01:52:15,872
Conclusions bad like

2178
01:52:16,128 --> 01:52:17,920
Soy latte

2179
01:52:18,176 --> 01:52:19,968
Story latte that's why they're such

2180
01:52:20,224 --> 01:52:21,504
Feminized dork

2181
01:52:22,016 --> 01:52:24,320
Or whatever and it just became a meme on the internet

2182
01:52:24,576 --> 01:52:28,928
And it probably actually he probably ripped it off of some message board

2183
01:52:29,184 --> 01:52:33,024
But he made a video about it kind of

2184
01:52:33,280 --> 01:52:34,048
Throwing around isn't

2185
01:52:34,304 --> 01:52:35,328
Cancel

2186
01:52:35,840 --> 01:52:37,632
The thing is it's not as fun as cuck

2187
01:52:37,888 --> 01:52:40,448
To say that so they're going to get to keep it

2188
01:52:40,704 --> 01:52:46,592
It's never guess I'm never going to throw soyboy back at Villa

2189
01:52:46,848 --> 01:52:51,200
So they get to just have it and it's going to linger in the alt-right world for a long time

2190
01:52:51,456 --> 01:52:55,808
Sadly could cook we reclaim does like ice hilarious

2191
01:52:56,064 --> 01:53:00,160
So the other thing is that boring intern whose name I can't remember

2192
01:53:00,928 --> 01:53:03,488
Baked a couple times they played a video of him

2193
01:53:03,744 --> 01:53:06,304
Going out to the University of Texas at

2194
01:53:07,840 --> 01:53:09,120
His name is soy seed

2195
01:53:10,912 --> 01:53:17,056
He goes out and he claims he's trying to get political discourse going or whatever people with

2196
01:53:17,312 --> 01:53:18,592
Signs and they just block him

2197
01:53:20,896 --> 01:53:26,016
It's the end of trying to walk around and they just block her

2198
01:53:32,672 --> 01:53:35,488
As like

2199
01:53:35,744 --> 01:53:40,096
The only thing that's actually in the video is whoever the cameraman is literally pushes a woman

2200
01:53:40,352 --> 01:53:45,216
The video of you guys doing

2201
01:53:45,472 --> 01:53:47,008
I bring it up

2202
01:53:47,264 --> 01:53:48,032
Is

2203
01:53:48,544 --> 01:53:49,056
VI

2204
01:53:49,824 --> 01:53:53,920
Wendy's being blocked by a sign he's actually this guy looks like a silly boy

2205
01:53:56,480 --> 01:53:56,992
He looks

2206
01:53:57,504 --> 01:53:58,016
Really weird

2207
01:53:58,784 --> 01:54:02,880
What Alex is productivity sales on your website have soy in them

2208
01:54:03,648 --> 01:54:06,208
There's a lot of Google Soriano's products

2209
01:54:06,720 --> 01:54:09,792
Exodus guys responses like

2210
01:54:10,304 --> 01:54:13,632
Pickle meme what I like that's a shity defense

2211
01:54:17,216 --> 01:54:20,800
We reached a new level of incompetence layout

2212
01:54:21,056 --> 01:54:24,384
You have got to figure this out being out in the field and recognize

2213
01:54:24,640 --> 01:54:29,504
Really something we believe it is just trying to make people mad

2214
01:54:29,760 --> 01:54:34,624
We're trying to provoke people in all of Alex's

2215
01:54:35,392 --> 01:54:36,672
Make the subtext text

2216
01:54:36,928 --> 01:54:37,952
Every time

2217
01:54:40,768 --> 01:54:44,608
Does next caller gets us back to the the other

2218
01:54:44,864 --> 01:54:46,912
They are going to make him cry

2219
01:54:47,168 --> 01:54:48,960
Side and then this is the other side

2220
01:54:49,216 --> 01:54:49,728
Alex

2221
01:54:50,240 --> 01:54:50,752
Wants

2222
01:54:51,008 --> 01:54:51,520
Your money

2223
01:54:52,288 --> 01:54:54,592
That's really bizarre because in this call

2224
01:54:56,128 --> 01:54:56,640
The caller

2225
01:54:56,896 --> 01:54:58,432
Literally offers to split Alex

2226
01:55:09,696 --> 01:55:10,976
Could you please buy some

2227
01:55:11,744 --> 01:55:13,792
Let's see what happen

2228
01:55:21,216 --> 01:55:24,032
I can tell

2229
01:55:24,288 --> 01:55:26,848
Weight of the world on your shoulders my friend

2230
01:55:27,360 --> 01:55:28,896
I'm an old friend

2231
01:55:29,920 --> 01:55:32,224
God works in mysterious ways my friend

2232
01:55:32,992 --> 01:55:34,016
That's why I'm calling tonight

2233
01:55:36,832 --> 01:55:37,344
First off

2234
01:55:40,160 --> 01:55:43,488
You have a lot of friends that are with you and behind you

2235
01:55:43,744 --> 01:55:44,768
Specifically

2236
01:55:45,280 --> 01:55:48,608
Folks that are self-made people that own their own businesses

2237
01:55:49,376 --> 01:55:53,472
The do their own thing and great job cetera

2238
01:55:53,728 --> 01:55:56,544
Around this world I know that I'm right on Campbell

2239
01:56:00,128 --> 01:56:01,664
It it's it's God's been

2240
01:56:01,920 --> 01:56:03,200
And I haven't talked to

2241
01:56:03,456 --> 01:56:04,480
2 + years

2242
01:56:10,112 --> 01:56:13,440
Just remember that you do have a lot of support and lot of friends behind you

2243
01:56:16,256 --> 01:56:17,792
Number two

2244
01:56:19,328 --> 01:56:21,632
There's a lot of stuff here working through with

2245
01:56:22,144 --> 01:56:25,472
Employee problems and all that crap

2246
01:56:25,984 --> 01:56:26,752
Grand Rapids

2247
01:56:27,008 --> 01:56:30,848
I'll put my money where my mouth is I don't have the millions that Gary has

2248
01:56:31,104 --> 01:56:32,384
However

2249
01:56:32,896 --> 01:56:36,224
I've got a fantastic labor law attorney and if you ever need any help

2250
01:56:37,248 --> 01:56:43,392
What's Bill with you you're awesome

2251
01:56:43,904 --> 01:56:45,952
Black people have done nothing to but help

2252
01:56:46,464 --> 01:56:50,560
Like one of them ever sick I let them on plus 4 months old pay them in the shop it's like

2253
01:56:51,072 --> 01:56:52,608
It's like the weakest people

2254
01:56:53,120 --> 01:56:56,704
But we still can't be evil it's about like the album

2255
01:56:56,960 --> 01:56:58,752
And they're like

2256
01:57:02,592 --> 01:57:05,664
Put your faith in humanity

2257
01:57:06,176 --> 01:57:09,760
Got my contact information

2258
01:57:10,016 --> 01:57:11,296
So you can talk to you

2259
01:57:11,552 --> 01:57:12,064
We don't talk

2260
01:57:12,320 --> 01:57:13,088
Later that's fine

2261
01:57:13,344 --> 01:57:15,648
But I I mean what I say in this

2262
01:57:19,232 --> 01:57:22,816
Haha yep once again we get back to

2263
01:57:29,216 --> 01:57:33,312
Dubai money

2264
01:57:33,568 --> 01:57:35,104
Do you not get the game yet

2265
01:57:35,360 --> 01:57:36,640
This leads me to my next

2266
01:57:37,152 --> 01:57:38,688
And that is that there was a

2267
01:57:38,944 --> 01:57:40,224
Much higher incidence

2268
01:57:40,736 --> 01:57:41,504
Of 425c

2269
01:57:41,760 --> 01:57:43,296
Supply commercials during the

2270
01:57:43,552 --> 01:57:44,576
The marathon

2271
01:57:44,832 --> 01:57:46,624
Then there ever is on his show

2272
01:57:46,880 --> 01:57:48,416
I think there's a reason

2273
01:57:49,184 --> 01:57:49,696
That is

2274
01:57:51,232 --> 01:57:53,792
45

2275
01:57:54,816 --> 01:57:55,840
I do I don't know

2276
01:57:56,096 --> 01:57:59,168
I don't I'm not a lawyer but I like the guy

2277
01:57:59,680 --> 01:58:01,728
A lot of self-made people

2278
01:58:01,984 --> 01:58:04,288
I make a lot of great jobs for a lot of people

2279
01:58:04,544 --> 01:58:06,848
I have a labor attorney on retainer

2280
01:58:10,688 --> 01:58:11,200
It's 8

2281
01:58:11,456 --> 01:58:17,600
Crazy to me that they keep stealing one of the best

2282
01:58:18,112 --> 01:58:19,648
No idea why my employees

2283
01:58:19,904 --> 01:58:22,464
But you understand

2284
01:58:22,720 --> 01:58:24,768
Is freaked out is vide recognizes

2285
01:58:25,024 --> 01:58:27,072
I'm not going to take these two court

2286
01:58:28,864 --> 01:58:30,912
He just knows he needs a certain amount

2287
01:58:31,168 --> 01:58:31,936
So he just wants to make

2288
01:58:32,192 --> 01:58:32,704
As much

2289
01:58:32,960 --> 01:58:33,472
Cuz he can

2290
01:58:33,728 --> 01:58:36,544
He's already budgeted out what these lawsuits are going to cost him

2291
01:58:36,800 --> 01:58:37,824
I'm sure

2292
01:58:39,104 --> 01:58:40,896
What's coming to like

2293
01:58:41,152 --> 01:58:43,712
I don't want you to give me a lawyer I want your money

2294
01:58:43,968 --> 01:58:45,248
This money

2295
01:58:45,504 --> 01:58:47,296
Understand me

2296
01:58:47,808 --> 01:58:51,136
You are offering to solve what is ostensibly the problem

2297
01:58:51,392 --> 01:58:52,416
Add to me that means

2298
01:58:52,672 --> 01:58:53,952
That's not the real problem

2299
01:58:54,208 --> 01:58:54,720
Course not

2300
01:58:54,976 --> 01:58:55,744
Or some other problem

2301
01:58:56,000 --> 01:58:59,584
To take this to court

2302
01:58:59,840 --> 01:59:00,352
Right

2303
01:59:00,608 --> 01:59:01,376
I will lose

2304
01:59:06,496 --> 01:59:11,872
I want to pay these people go away I have a lawyer who's just

2305
01:59:12,128 --> 01:59:12,640
Good enough

2306
01:59:13,152 --> 01:59:15,968
To threaten the people who are suing me with

2307
01:59:16,224 --> 01:59:18,272
Exposing information about them

2308
01:59:18,528 --> 01:59:24,672
To make it lower

2309
01:59:26,464 --> 01:59:32,608
He's able to apology

2310
01:59:37,216 --> 01:59:41,312
That's what's going to end up happening he knows that

2311
01:59:41,824 --> 01:59:42,336
Like that

2312
01:59:42,592 --> 01:59:45,664
It's got to be something else I don't know exactly what it is

2313
01:59:45,920 --> 01:59:47,712
That that leads me to believe like

2314
01:59:48,992 --> 01:59:50,272
These lawsuits

2315
01:59:50,784 --> 01:59:52,320
Are f****** him up emotional

2316
01:59:52,832 --> 01:59:53,600
Because he knows he's built

2317
01:59:54,112 --> 01:59:55,392
That's what

2318
01:59:55,648 --> 01:59:58,976
Driving the the performance in the emotion

2319
01:59:59,232 --> 02:00:00,512
And the feelings screwed

2320
02:00:00,768 --> 02:00:01,792
Do that service.

2321
02:00:02,048 --> 02:00:03,328
But it's not the financial

2322
02:00:04,096 --> 02:00:06,144
I think he's just using like okay

2323
02:00:06,656 --> 02:00:07,680
These people are suing me

2324
02:00:07,936 --> 02:00:09,984
YouTube is coming after me in quote

2325
02:00:10,752 --> 02:00:12,032
Perfect opportunity

2326
02:00:12,288 --> 02:00:13,568
For me to put on a marathon

2327
02:00:13,824 --> 02:00:19,968
I raised a whole shitload of money

2328
02:00:20,224 --> 02:00:21,504
Ostensibly

2329
02:00:22,016 --> 02:00:23,296
Hey what's weird

2330
02:00:23,552 --> 02:00:25,600
During this 34 hour marathon

2331
02:00:25,856 --> 02:00:26,624
We got one

2332
02:00:26,880 --> 02:00:27,648
Huge donation

2333
02:00:27,904 --> 02:00:28,928
Also telling

2334
02:00:33,024 --> 02:00:36,096
Crazy

2335
02:00:36,352 --> 02:00:36,864
This one

2336
02:00:37,120 --> 02:00:37,888
Massive

2337
02:00:38,400 --> 02:00:41,984
Hundred million dollar donation from an anonymous donor

2338
02:00:42,240 --> 02:00:43,776
He's clearly an Infowars listener

2339
02:00:44,032 --> 02:00:48,896
It loves it loves it through this business I am running illegally

2340
02:00:50,688 --> 02:00:51,456
This point

2341
02:00:52,480 --> 02:00:54,528
Alex decides to say some stuff

2342
02:00:55,296 --> 02:00:55,808
You should not have

2343
02:00:56,832 --> 02:00:57,344
At this point

2344
02:00:57,856 --> 02:00:59,136
He gets into

2345
02:01:01,440 --> 02:01:02,976
I can't imagine this not coming up in

2346
02:01:03,744 --> 02:01:06,560
Not quite frankly he starts talking about Rob Jacobs

2347
02:01:07,072 --> 02:01:09,632
And ways that he doesn't

2348
02:01:10,144 --> 02:01:11,424
He doesn't need to say these things

2349
02:01:11,680 --> 02:01:12,704
His lawyers

2350
02:01:12,960 --> 02:01:14,496
Should have told him to say nothing

2351
02:01:14,752 --> 02:01:16,288
I would advise them that

2352
02:01:16,544 --> 02:01:22,688
Give good advice

2353
02:01:25,760 --> 02:01:27,808
Alex

2354
02:01:28,064 --> 02:01:34,208
Shut up

2355
02:01:40,864 --> 02:01:45,984
Billable hours

2356
02:01:47,008 --> 02:01:47,520
Locked up

2357
02:01:56,736 --> 02:01:57,760
I knew Rob Jacobson

2358
02:01:58,016 --> 02:02:00,320
I had a video letter one at a few other editors

2359
02:02:00,832 --> 02:02:03,136
Show Homeland so alone

2360
02:02:03,904 --> 02:02:08,512
And don't ever treat him well he couldn't believe he got a paycheck and he works all these free liberal things and

2361
02:02:08,768 --> 02:02:14,912
Please stop

2362
02:02:15,168 --> 02:02:21,312
Bob likes giving and I was nice to English

2363
02:02:22,848 --> 02:02:23,616
Black Trump

2364
02:02:24,128 --> 02:02:27,456
Do it well that's okay.

2365
02:02:28,224 --> 02:02:28,736
And

2366
02:02:30,528 --> 02:02:32,832
I like that and say all that

2367
02:02:33,088 --> 02:02:33,856
It's like

2368
02:02:34,880 --> 02:02:37,184
Defeating him which we will

2369
02:02:40,256 --> 02:02:44,864
Like I would walk around the office calling people any Semitic names I mean not looking play

2370
02:02:45,888 --> 02:02:46,912
No he was just telling you

2371
02:02:48,192 --> 02:02:49,984
Call people names

2372
02:02:50,240 --> 02:02:50,752
Powerful

2373
02:02:51,776 --> 02:02:53,568
I told Noah

2374
02:02:53,824 --> 02:02:55,360
Stuff for him

2375
02:02:55,616 --> 02:02:57,664
They know what to say they know

2376
02:02:58,176 --> 02:02:58,944
To invert

2377
02:02:59,456 --> 02:03:00,480
Misrepresent

2378
02:03:01,248 --> 02:03:03,040
Like I would sit there and say oh

2379
02:03:03,552 --> 02:03:05,600
Like I said things they say why

2380
02:03:06,112 --> 02:03:07,136
I walk into the room and

2381
02:03:07,392 --> 02:03:08,416
Scream

2382
02:03:08,672 --> 02:03:12,256
Apple Jacks at black people

2383
02:03:12,512 --> 02:03:13,536
Shoes

2384
02:03:13,792 --> 02:03:14,816
That's not the complaint either

2385
02:03:15,328 --> 02:03:19,168
Droid telling us what it is he's doing

2386
02:03:19,424 --> 02:03:21,216
Well then

2387
02:03:21,472 --> 02:03:24,288
The complaint but it is totally out of context

2388
02:03:24,544 --> 02:03:28,896
For some it's just another creating a straw man of the complaint

2389
02:03:29,152 --> 02:03:30,944
Here in Ashley beckford's EEOC

2390
02:03:31,200 --> 02:03:31,712
Complaints

2391
02:03:31,968 --> 02:03:34,528
Barry mcbreen receive two gifts of fitness shoes

2392
02:03:34,784 --> 02:03:36,832
Which was Laden with swastika

2393
02:03:37,088 --> 02:03:38,880
Donald Trump

2394
02:03:39,136 --> 02:03:40,416
Would you probably display to me

2395
02:03:43,744 --> 02:03:45,024
Prince's that's great

2396
02:03:45,536 --> 02:03:46,048
Hostile work

2397
02:03:46,560 --> 02:03:50,656
He was one of the pairs and then in parentheses it specifically States

2398
02:03:50,912 --> 02:03:51,936
Without the swap

2399
02:03:52,704 --> 02:03:58,848
So Alex Lange

2400
02:03:59,104 --> 02:04:00,128
Other pair

2401
02:04:00,384 --> 02:04:02,432
But showed me the swastika shoes

2402
02:04:02,688 --> 02:04:03,968
It's it's fine

2403
02:04:04,224 --> 02:04:06,272
They don't wear nothing shoes

2404
02:04:06,528 --> 02:04:12,672
Display them proudly in their offices like your bronze baby shoes

2405
02:04:15,232 --> 02:04:18,560
I think I would rather have them

2406
02:04:22,144 --> 02:04:24,192
That's kind of like

2407
02:04:25,216 --> 02:04:28,032
I'm very torn about it cuz like

2408
02:04:31,616 --> 02:04:34,432
Torn about it because on the one hand like if someone

2409
02:04:34,688 --> 02:04:40,832
That's not see shoes I would be like

2410
02:04:41,088 --> 02:04:44,928
Imagine if we had such a f*****-up body and puts it looks like us use of swastika

2411
02:04:45,440 --> 02:04:51,584
Like I would be blown away and if I worked at a workplace I. Can you believe how f*****-up

2412
02:04:52,608 --> 02:04:55,168
And I probably would show them to people

2413
02:04:55,424 --> 02:04:56,192
Or something like that

2414
02:04:57,728 --> 02:04:58,752
The fact that it's in a cup

2415
02:04:59,008 --> 02:05:00,288
Complaint leads me to believe that the

2416
02:05:00,544 --> 02:05:03,360
The presentation of it was very different

2417
02:05:04,640 --> 02:05:05,408
For real

2418
02:05:06,176 --> 02:05:09,248
Maybe we're the bad guys here

2419
02:05:09,760 --> 02:05:10,784
Swastika shoes

2420
02:05:11,040 --> 02:05:13,600
Indication that like

2421
02:05:14,112 --> 02:05:14,880
Maybe we're not

2422
02:05:15,136 --> 02:05:15,904
Cruising the best

2423
02:05:17,184 --> 02:05:18,976
Just another instance

2424
02:05:19,232 --> 02:05:20,256
Creating strawberry

2425
02:05:21,536 --> 02:05:22,048
About

2426
02:05:22,304 --> 02:05:22,816
The claim

2427
02:05:23,072 --> 02:05:25,888
She's just saying that the claims are different that they are with

2428
02:05:26,144 --> 02:05:28,192
Leads me to believe that the real claim

2429
02:05:28,704 --> 02:05:30,496
Or the reality is at the claims of paleo

2430
02:05:30,752 --> 02:05:32,800
Oh absolutely

2431
02:05:34,080 --> 02:05:35,872
And we do all this

2432
02:05:36,128 --> 02:05:38,688
Doesn't hurt me attack

2433
02:05:40,736 --> 02:05:42,528
It hurts me that they've got people

2434
02:05:43,040 --> 02:05:46,112
So given over to the lies that they believe it

2435
02:05:46,368 --> 02:05:47,136
Is that something

2436
02:05:48,928 --> 02:05:50,208
Well

2437
02:05:50,976 --> 02:05:51,488
I'm Hitler

2438
02:05:52,768 --> 02:05:54,304
I don't think George Soros

2439
02:05:54,816 --> 02:05:57,376
They believe someone

2440
02:05:57,632 --> 02:05:59,680
Is fighting the Hitler energy

2441
02:06:00,192 --> 02:06:00,704
Supplement

2442
02:06:00,960 --> 02:06:03,264
Argue in debate

2443
02:06:03,776 --> 02:06:04,544
David Duke

2444
02:06:17,088 --> 02:06:18,624
David Duke point out that

2445
02:06:18,880 --> 02:06:24,000
We had an unprecedented amount of time for an interview with Alex

2446
02:06:24,768 --> 02:06:26,048
Do you love David

2447
02:06:26,304 --> 02:06:30,912
Seemed like he wanted to appear tonight

2448
02:06:31,168 --> 02:06:34,240
It seems like they just had a word

2449
02:06:34,496 --> 02:06:36,288
Seems like they just had Samantha

2450
02:06:36,544 --> 02:06:38,592
Check differences about their beliefs

2451
02:06:39,104 --> 02:06:40,896
Send it

2452
02:06:41,408 --> 02:06:42,432
Complained

2453
02:06:42,688 --> 02:06:44,992
They references David Duke interview because

2454
02:06:45,248 --> 02:06:45,760
David Duke

2455
02:06:47,296 --> 02:06:47,808
Jewish India

2456
02:06:48,320 --> 02:06:53,184
Individual

2457
02:06:53,440 --> 02:06:54,720
And the resident Jew

2458
02:06:54,976 --> 02:06:56,256
And stuff like that

2459
02:06:56,512 --> 02:06:58,560
Police harassment

2460
02:06:58,816 --> 02:07:01,632
Environment

2461
02:07:02,656 --> 02:07:03,680
That's very interesting

2462
02:07:03,936 --> 02:07:05,728
Singers like Alex

2463
02:07:05,984 --> 02:07:07,008
Again is making a straw man

2464
02:07:07,264 --> 02:07:08,800
In the complaint

2465
02:07:10,592 --> 02:07:11,104
That's not

2466
02:07:14,176 --> 02:07:15,712
And the inversion

2467
02:07:16,992 --> 02:07:19,040
They always total flip

2468
02:07:19,552 --> 02:07:21,088
We're fighting satanism

2469
02:07:21,344 --> 02:07:26,720
Dover

2470
02:07:26,976 --> 02:07:29,024
Look at someone whose soul

2471
02:07:29,280 --> 02:07:30,816
Has been overrun

2472
02:07:31,584 --> 02:07:34,656
JoJo oh my God

2473
02:07:35,680 --> 02:07:38,240
Grab somebody

2474
02:07:38,496 --> 02:07:41,056
And just talk into hell

2475
02:07:44,384 --> 02:07:46,688
They said about you

2476
02:07:46,944 --> 02:07:48,480
You're thinking about them like

2477
02:07:48,992 --> 02:07:51,552
What dimension do they hang in like

2478
02:07:55,392 --> 02:07:59,232
Scarlett Johansson age

2479
02:08:05,376 --> 02:08:05,888
Mansion

2480
02:08:06,400 --> 02:08:09,728
What happened to lullwater in the memo get naked

2481
02:08:14,080 --> 02:08:15,104
Real men win

2482
02:08:15,360 --> 02:08:16,384
To be killed

2483
02:08:17,152 --> 02:08:19,712
Ritualistically the movie

2484
02:08:20,224 --> 02:08:21,760
The movie with

2485
02:08:23,552 --> 02:08:25,088
The movie

2486
02:08:26,624 --> 02:08:27,648
Angler fish

2487
02:08:28,160 --> 02:08:29,184
Light

2488
02:08:29,440 --> 02:08:30,720
That beautiful woman was a lie

2489
02:08:35,072 --> 02:08:36,352
Cool.

2490
02:08:37,888 --> 02:08:39,168
It's like what the

2491
02:08:39,424 --> 02:08:42,752
The hell and you realize Hollywood powers like that black

2492
02:08:43,008 --> 02:08:46,592
You're finally going to be

2493
02:08:47,360 --> 02:08:48,896
Apparel

2494
02:08:52,224 --> 02:08:52,736
Hi-C

2495
02:08:52,992 --> 02:08:54,016
Would that the metaphor

2496
02:08:59,392 --> 02:08:59,904
What am I

2497
02:09:03,232 --> 02:09:06,304
And then you see a response

2498
02:09:06,560 --> 02:09:07,328
Yep

2499
02:09:10,400 --> 02:09:11,424
It was gay grooming

2500
02:09:12,192 --> 02:09:14,752
So that becomes Jones is having a grooming in

2501
02:09:15,264 --> 02:09:16,288
Women

2502
02:09:16,544 --> 02:09:18,848
Don't think so man hug

2503
02:09:21,920 --> 02:09:23,456
Also the shuttle

2504
02:09:23,712 --> 02:09:24,480
She hugged me

2505
02:09:25,760 --> 02:09:27,808
A woman hugged

2506
02:09:28,064 --> 02:09:28,576
Les Schwab

2507
02:09:30,368 --> 02:09:33,440
So he's being satanic cuz he's flipping thing pretty much

2508
02:09:35,744 --> 02:09:39,328
Baclofen 100° is

2509
02:09:39,840 --> 02:09:40,352
Exhausting

2510
02:09:40,864 --> 02:09:42,912
Like when I heard that I was like I

2511
02:09:43,168 --> 02:09:43,680
I

2512
02:09:45,472 --> 02:09:45,984
I mean

2513
02:09:46,752 --> 02:09:47,776
Empathy is tough

2514
02:09:48,032 --> 02:09:54,176
At this point for him like in the middle of that telling of a Scarlett Johansson movies plot for 10

2515
02:09:54,944 --> 02:09:55,456
I like

2516
02:09:55,968 --> 02:09:56,992
I worry for him

2517
02:09:57,248 --> 02:09:59,552
There's still a part of me that's like

2518
02:09:59,808 --> 02:10:00,320
I am

2519
02:10:00,576 --> 02:10:02,880
Deeply concerned about what's going on in that head

2520
02:10:06,208 --> 02:10:08,256
Doesn't know that all of his list

2521
02:10:08,512 --> 02:10:09,024
Is there Nazis

2522
02:10:09,280 --> 02:10:11,584
Yeah we're at least eight the die-hard one

2523
02:10:11,840 --> 02:10:13,632
Let's get to this next week cuz that's actually

2524
02:10:13,888 --> 02:10:14,400
Super

2525
02:10:14,656 --> 02:10:15,680
Mentalist

2526
02:10:16,192 --> 02:10:17,728
At the beginning of this quote

2527
02:10:18,752 --> 02:10:19,776
Themes delusional

2528
02:10:20,032 --> 02:10:21,056
At the end of it

2529
02:10:22,080 --> 02:10:22,848
Is

2530
02:10:23,104 --> 02:10:24,128
Is delusional

2531
02:10:24,896 --> 02:10:25,408
Powerful

2532
02:10:27,456 --> 02:10:30,272
Michael Jackson lawyer

2533
02:10:33,344 --> 02:10:34,624
The Democrats

2534
02:10:34,880 --> 02:10:36,416
Every time I defeat them

2535
02:10:37,952 --> 02:10:39,232
It's not like a power trip

2536
02:10:43,072 --> 02:10:44,096
I keep beating the globe

2537
02:10:44,608 --> 02:10:48,192
You have narrowly avoided people following through with lawsuit

2538
02:10:48,448 --> 02:10:50,752
How do you make multiple public apologies

2539
02:10:51,008 --> 02:10:52,544
And basically just

2540
02:10:52,800 --> 02:10:53,312
You mean

2541
02:10:53,568 --> 02:10:55,104
You are the one who settled

2542
02:10:55,616 --> 02:10:58,944
You know like you are the one

2543
02:10:59,200 --> 02:11:02,528
Right

2544
02:11:02,784 --> 02:11:03,552
But you didn't

2545
02:11:04,064 --> 02:11:05,856
You lost a lawsuit

2546
02:11:08,160 --> 02:11:12,512
Custody case with his wife

2547
02:11:16,096 --> 02:11:19,168
Because apparently he's been dragging it out then

2548
02:11:19,424 --> 02:11:20,704
I would like to injunction

2549
02:11:24,288 --> 02:11:28,128
Globalstar real beatings the globalist

2550
02:11:28,384 --> 02:11:31,456
She's losing lawsuits to people he slandered and mistreated

2551
02:11:31,712 --> 02:11:34,528
But then narrowly getting through

2552
02:11:34,784 --> 02:11:37,856
Out of a pickle

2553
02:11:39,648 --> 02:11:40,672
These people

2554
02:11:41,184 --> 02:11:41,952
So f****** good

2555
02:11:43,744 --> 02:11:44,256
Bad games

2556
02:11:44,512 --> 02:11:45,280
That's a troubling

2557
02:11:45,536 --> 02:11:46,304
Way to look at reality

2558
02:11:46,560 --> 02:11:47,072
Favorite

2559
02:11:47,840 --> 02:11:48,352
Did not see things

2560
02:11:50,400 --> 02:11:52,704
It's like God why did they join me

2561
02:11:54,752 --> 02:11:56,800
Like will be him

2562
02:11:57,056 --> 02:11:57,824
Will be there

2563
02:11:58,336 --> 02:11:59,104
Will be gem

2564
02:11:59,360 --> 02:12:00,640
Will be there

2565
02:12:00,896 --> 02:12:02,944
Over but the listeners

2566
02:12:03,456 --> 02:12:04,736
The activist they just keep

2567
02:12:04,992 --> 02:12:08,320
The word activity

2568
02:12:08,576 --> 02:12:09,600
Have what they want

2569
02:12:09,856 --> 02:12:12,672
Over and over and over and over and over again

2570
02:12:16,512 --> 02:12:17,792
Third time he said he wants to quit

2571
02:12:18,304 --> 02:12:20,096
Play roll over like a dead whale

2572
02:12:21,632 --> 02:12:24,960
South African Farmers that produce 70% there's

2573
02:12:28,544 --> 02:12:30,080
Nobody

2574
02:12:30,592 --> 02:12:31,616
Aberdeen population

2575
02:12:32,384 --> 02:12:33,152
Is 40

2576
02:12:33,408 --> 02:12:34,688
Thousand Farms

2577
02:12:34,944 --> 02:12:35,456
Baby

2578
02:12:36,736 --> 02:12:38,272
130,000 people on

2579
02:12:38,528 --> 02:12:40,320
Little Farms

2580
02:12:41,088 --> 02:12:44,160
No way leave.

2581
02:12:46,208 --> 02:12:48,000
Under communist rule they don't even know

2582
02:12:52,864 --> 02:12:54,144
Today

2583
02:12:56,704 --> 02:12:58,496
Interracial brainwashing

2584
02:12:58,752 --> 02:13:01,824
Patroon Asia activity they don't even know

2585
02:13:03,104 --> 02:13:04,384
They just want to kill

2586
02:13:07,456 --> 02:13:08,736
And that's with reach me up

2587
02:13:10,016 --> 02:13:11,296
Freaked out by that if that were real

2588
02:13:11,808 --> 02:13:14,624
South Africa

2589
02:13:14,880 --> 02:13:15,392
Department

2590
02:13:15,648 --> 02:13:19,488
They voted 240 1283 to confiscate the white on land without

2591
02:13:21,536 --> 02:13:27,680
Population at own approximately 72% of the farm

2592
02:13:30,752 --> 02:13:31,520
Colonization

2593
02:13:31,776 --> 02:13:32,288
And apartheid

2594
02:13:35,360 --> 02:13:39,456
Distributed as the white minority possession about

2595
02:13:39,712 --> 02:13:40,992
Three-quarters of usable land

2596
02:13:41,248 --> 02:13:43,040
In South Africa

2597
02:13:43,296 --> 02:13:43,808
Controls

2598
02:13:44,064 --> 02:13:46,624
They were massive will they own it dance

2599
02:13:46,880 --> 02:13:48,160
Power imbalance

2600
02:13:48,416 --> 02:13:49,440
That's how that works

2601
02:13:55,072 --> 02:13:58,912
Even this Marxist guy that Alex is railing a bad was like we're not

2602
02:13:59,168 --> 02:14:00,704
Talking about slaughtering White

2603
02:14:00,960 --> 02:14:01,472
People

2604
02:14:01,728 --> 02:14:03,264
But here's where the quote goes bad

2605
02:14:03,776 --> 02:14:04,544
At least not yet

2606
02:14:08,640 --> 02:14:09,664
Went bad

2607
02:14:09,920 --> 02:14:13,760
I feel like that was the right thing it's bad Optics

2608
02:14:15,552 --> 02:14:16,576
The situation

2609
02:14:16,832 --> 02:14:17,600
That's funny

2610
02:14:18,112 --> 02:14:18,624
And also

2611
02:14:18,880 --> 02:14:19,904
I hope he means it I didn't

2612
02:14:20,160 --> 02:14:23,488
Hear it said so it could have been in jest I don't know

2613
02:14:23,744 --> 02:14:27,072
Like what this situation we're looking at now is just

2614
02:14:27,328 --> 02:14:30,400
People trying to make right what wasn't made right at the end

2615
02:14:31,424 --> 02:14:31,936
Because

2616
02:14:32,192 --> 02:14:34,240
Control of the land is power

2617
02:14:34,496 --> 02:14:38,848
Even though the formal system of apartheid went away you live in a place where people can

2618
02:14:39,104 --> 02:14:40,640
Possibly live Equitable live

2619
02:14:41,152 --> 02:14:45,248
Three-quarters of the land is owned by less than 8% of the people

2620
02:14:45,760 --> 02:14:49,856
State-sponsored apartheid doesn't mean it's still not economic

2621
02:14:50,112 --> 02:14:51,136
Apartheid

2622
02:14:51,648 --> 02:14:52,928
Ironically

2623
02:14:53,184 --> 02:14:55,232
Lot of the afrikaners

2624
02:14:57,024 --> 02:14:58,304
This Brewing by Parliament

2625
02:15:03,936 --> 02:15:04,960
Which is really funny

2626
02:15:05,216 --> 02:15:06,752
Considering everything

2627
02:15:08,032 --> 02:15:10,336
Also the opponents of this move and claimed

2628
02:15:10,592 --> 02:15:12,640
Zimbabwe

2629
02:15:12,896 --> 02:15:13,408
A 2000

2630
02:15:13,664 --> 02:15:14,176
Atlanta Mass

2631
02:15:15,200 --> 02:15:21,344
But most experts would be quick to point out that the reason that happened was rampant Corruption of

2632
02:15:24,160 --> 02:15:27,232
Maybe one of history modern history is great villain

2633
02:15:27,488 --> 02:15:29,280
Has more to do with that then

2634
02:15:34,144 --> 02:15:36,960
The corruption aspirin

2635
02:15:38,240 --> 02:15:41,056
More Equitable state

2636
02:15:42,080 --> 02:15:42,848
Is that I told you

2637
02:15:43,104 --> 02:15:45,408
Alex Jones is first section

2638
02:15:45,664 --> 02:15:46,432
The 11th

2639
02:15:46,688 --> 02:15:47,200
Before

2640
02:15:47,456 --> 02:15:48,992
Section during the day

2641
02:15:49,248 --> 02:15:50,272
He had Simon wrote

2642
02:15:50,784 --> 02:15:52,832
The flying Burger

2643
02:15:53,344 --> 02:15:53,856
He was on

2644
02:15:54,112 --> 02:15:55,904
How to promote a fundraiser

2645
02:15:56,160 --> 02:15:56,672
Like a go fund

2646
02:15:57,696 --> 02:15:58,208
Of course

2647
02:15:58,464 --> 02:15:59,744
Because we're not be allowed on any

2648
02:16:00,000 --> 02:16:03,072
Mainstream

2649
02:16:03,584 --> 02:16:04,864
If I went to check on it

2650
02:16:05,120 --> 02:16:05,632
Periodically

2651
02:16:05,888 --> 02:16:07,424
Play throughout the day

2652
02:16:08,192 --> 02:16:10,240
It's just one of those things

2653
02:16:13,568 --> 02:16:15,360
He's on there

2654
02:16:15,616 --> 02:16:19,200
He was on the show is $85

2655
02:16:20,224 --> 02:16:23,808
So I wanted to check back later little bit later in the night maybe likes

2656
02:16:24,064 --> 02:16:26,112
Six seven hours later I checked back and they were like

2657
02:16:26,368 --> 02:16:27,904
$400 or so

2658
02:16:28,416 --> 02:16:29,440
But I was looking through it

2659
02:16:29,696 --> 02:16:31,488
And one of them was an anonymous donation

2660
02:16:32,000 --> 02:16:33,024
For $100

2661
02:16:33,792 --> 02:16:34,816
And the commented

2662
02:16:35,328 --> 02:16:35,840
Was just

2663
02:16:36,096 --> 02:16:36,864
The 14 words

2664
02:16:39,424 --> 02:16:40,448
We must have

2665
02:16:40,704 --> 02:16:43,520
I'm sure the future of white children blah blah blah

2666
02:16:43,776 --> 02:16:44,800
Just verbatim

2667
02:16:45,056 --> 02:16:45,568
I like

2668
02:16:45,824 --> 02:16:46,336
Yep

2669
02:16:46,848 --> 02:16:47,360
You guys get it

2670
02:16:47,616 --> 02:16:48,128
Yeah.

2671
02:16:50,176 --> 02:16:52,480
And I when I woke up in the morning I went back to check

2672
02:16:52,736 --> 02:16:54,272
To see how their fundraiser was doing

2673
02:16:54,528 --> 02:16:55,296
And that comment

2674
02:17:00,160 --> 02:17:00,928
You know

2675
02:17:01,440 --> 02:17:02,208
Did the cause

2676
02:17:02,464 --> 02:17:02,976
B b

2677
02:17:03,488 --> 02:17:04,000
Pushed

2678
02:17:04,512 --> 02:17:05,792
Clearly very popular

2679
02:17:06,048 --> 02:17:07,840
I'm on white nationalist white supremacist

2680
02:17:08,096 --> 02:17:09,632
Right arm and Alex's

2681
02:17:10,400 --> 02:17:12,192
Clearly helping that cause Ride Along

2682
02:17:13,472 --> 02:17:13,984
Really weird

2683
02:17:14,496 --> 02:17:18,336
Also the the farmer murder stuff as we went over on a wreath

2684
02:17:23,456 --> 02:17:24,480
Contextualize

2685
02:17:24,992 --> 02:17:25,504
So it's

2686
02:17:25,760 --> 02:17:26,272
Is it

2687
02:17:27,808 --> 02:17:28,576
Hippie

2688
02:17:29,088 --> 02:17:32,672
They would almost be something to talk about if they would admit like

2689
02:17:33,952 --> 02:17:34,720
They're taking

2690
02:17:34,976 --> 02:17:36,000
Our land back

2691
02:17:39,584 --> 02:17:42,656
Is racist against white people and they're taking our land if they were like

2692
02:17:42,912 --> 02:17:44,704
They're taking our land back

2693
02:17:44,960 --> 02:17:46,752
Then you would have a conversation of

2694
02:17:47,008 --> 02:17:50,336
Well is that is that a good way of doing things

2695
02:17:50,592 --> 02:17:56,736
There's a conversation is that the best

2696
02:17:56,992 --> 02:18:01,344
Like moral standpoint but just from like a general stability

2697
02:18:01,856 --> 02:18:05,440
Do that

2698
02:18:05,696 --> 02:18:08,768
Now mainly it was horrific

2699
02:18:09,024 --> 02:18:10,816
But it's possible that that policy

2700
02:18:11,072 --> 02:18:11,584
Decision

2701
02:18:11,840 --> 02:18:13,120
Did have something to do with

2702
02:18:13,632 --> 02:18:19,776
So maybe let's have a conversation about the best way to take your land

2703
02:18:20,032 --> 02:18:21,568
Conversation about

2704
02:18:21,824 --> 02:18:24,128
You think we're just stealing your land

2705
02:18:24,384 --> 02:18:24,896
Yeah

2706
02:18:25,152 --> 02:18:27,712
Yeah you know I agree

2707
02:18:28,224 --> 02:18:30,784
Peaceful transition of power as opposed to

2708
02:18:31,296 --> 02:18:32,064
We're just taking it

2709
02:18:33,856 --> 02:18:34,624
And it is

2710
02:18:35,648 --> 02:18:38,208
It brings to the state

2711
02:18:38,720 --> 02:18:39,744
Should have been in

2712
02:18:40,000 --> 02:18:44,096
Exactly were a crime not too long ago

2713
02:18:44,864 --> 02:18:45,632
8 stops

2714
02:18:46,144 --> 02:18:47,424
Blake if you stole

2715
02:18:47,680 --> 02:18:49,472
A very valuable painting

2716
02:18:49,984 --> 02:18:54,592
And then whatever the museum was like hey could you work we're going to take

2717
02:18:54,848 --> 02:18:56,640
You were like

2718
02:18:56,896 --> 02:18:57,664
This is your

2719
02:18:57,920 --> 02:18:58,944
Do you like my art

2720
02:19:00,224 --> 02:19:01,504
Clothesline

2721
02:19:02,272 --> 02:19:04,064
So

2722
02:19:05,088 --> 02:19:05,856
Besom

2723
02:19:06,624 --> 02:19:07,648
Signal I think

2724
02:19:07,904 --> 02:19:10,976
The issue is far more complicated than even our

2725
02:19:12,000 --> 02:19:14,048
Analysis of it

2726
02:19:14,304 --> 02:19:16,864
Morally it is right to take their land

2727
02:19:17,120 --> 02:19:18,400
Like practically

2728
02:19:18,656 --> 02:19:21,472
How you do that is a very different conversation

2729
02:19:24,800 --> 02:19:26,080
Is more real than Alex's

2730
02:19:26,336 --> 02:19:29,152
We're even like some

2731
02:19:32,736 --> 02:19:33,760
Let alone

2732
02:19:34,528 --> 02:19:35,296
True true

2733
02:19:36,832 --> 02:19:40,416
Alex Jones plays

2734
02:19:41,696 --> 02:19:42,976
I'm out I don't want to work

2735
02:19:43,232 --> 02:19:46,816
Olivia Olivia

2736
02:19:47,584 --> 02:19:53,728
Feel like I could turn it around

2737
02:19:58,592 --> 02:19:59,872
It's the Frank

2738
02:20:00,128 --> 02:20:00,640
Call Zin

2739
02:20:01,152 --> 02:20:02,432
Isaac Alex I am sick

2740
02:20:02,688 --> 02:20:03,200
Tired of you

2741
02:20:03,712 --> 02:20:06,016
Cleaning all the time about how people are trying to shut you down

2742
02:20:10,112 --> 02:20:11,904
Bright I need your help Frank

2743
02:20:12,160 --> 02:20:12,928
Spencer Shay

2744
02:20:13,440 --> 02:20:19,584
And so it's an ad commercial

2745
02:20:20,608 --> 02:20:21,888
I'm seriously that he's being shut down

2746
02:20:22,400 --> 02:20:24,448
I took the entire night in the Infowars

2747
02:20:24,704 --> 02:20:26,240
Everyone was calling each other Frank

2748
02:20:26,496 --> 02:20:27,520
Like it wasn't meme

2749
02:20:30,080 --> 02:20:30,592
Can Franklin

2750
02:20:30,848 --> 02:20:32,128
Ralph

2751
02:20:33,664 --> 02:20:35,456
Sprite

2752
02:20:35,712 --> 02:20:36,224
For this

2753
02:20:36,480 --> 02:20:37,248
Next clip

2754
02:20:37,760 --> 02:20:39,552
I was just another caller

2755
02:20:39,808 --> 02:20:40,576
Later in the Brock

2756
02:20:44,928 --> 02:20:47,744
Yeah it's about midnight where I'm at and I'm wondering how Frank

2757
02:20:58,240 --> 02:21:00,032
What one time

2758
02:21:00,544 --> 02:21:04,384
What real quick I'm going to scroll this back a tiny bit cuz even I misrepresented

2759
02:21:04,640 --> 02:21:08,224
Actual commercial the same

2760
02:21:08,480 --> 02:21:09,248
Complaining all the time

2761
02:21:09,760 --> 02:21:11,808
He says I'm tired of you bragging all the time

2762
02:21:12,320 --> 02:21:15,392
Kind of

2763
02:21:15,648 --> 02:21:16,672
I'm super important

2764
02:21:17,184 --> 02:21:18,720
Steven A misrepresentation

2765
02:21:18,976 --> 02:21:21,024
Presentation I apologize that I I slept up

2766
02:21:23,584 --> 02:21:25,376
Plug one time

2767
02:21:25,632 --> 02:21:28,704
I'm being shut down everybody went bought products

2768
02:21:30,752 --> 02:21:31,264
Boost

2769
02:21:32,800 --> 02:21:34,080
That would be so upset

2770
02:21:36,640 --> 02:21:37,920
He's an interesting fellow

2771
02:21:38,432 --> 02:21:42,272
He called them and said all but you want to get your ass also stuff

2772
02:21:42,784 --> 02:21:43,808
He probably can't find

2773
02:21:48,928 --> 02:21:50,976
I'm just trying to restore stuff

2774
02:21:51,488 --> 02:21:53,792
And Frank's betcha that I'm saying I'm under attack

2775
02:21:54,304 --> 02:21:55,584
What do I do just not

2776
02:21:58,912 --> 02:22:01,216
I really am attacking people not seen

2777
02:22:01,728 --> 02:22:02,240
Wow

2778
02:22:04,800 --> 02:22:05,824
And this time I am

2779
02:22:06,336 --> 02:22:10,432
At least I have the little now

2780
02:22:10,944 --> 02:22:13,504
Yeah that's that's f***** up

2781
02:22:13,760 --> 02:22:17,088
The game man I have to say I'm under attack to get funding

2782
02:22:19,136 --> 02:22:22,720
Remembering

2783
02:22:22,976 --> 02:22:24,768
Yeah so is not good

2784
02:22:25,792 --> 02:22:29,120
Particularly pissed off that he's being sued for like racial

2785
02:22:29,376 --> 02:22:30,912
Harassment

2786
02:22:31,424 --> 02:22:33,216
The healthy work environment

2787
02:22:34,752 --> 02:22:35,520
Because he's

2788
02:22:36,800 --> 02:22:37,312
Everybody

2789
02:22:37,568 --> 02:22:38,080
Man

2790
02:22:38,592 --> 02:22:39,104
And if you do what

2791
02:22:39,616 --> 02:22:40,128
Sometimes

2792
02:22:40,384 --> 02:22:40,896
31

2793
02:22:41,152 --> 02:22:41,920
Prizes liberal

2794
02:22:42,944 --> 02:22:45,504
Leftist

2795
02:22:45,760 --> 02:22:49,088
Minorities and women I don't care

2796
02:22:49,344 --> 02:22:53,440
What color you are are German woman

2797
02:22:53,952 --> 02:22:56,000
Listening to music

2798
02:22:57,280 --> 02:22:59,328
Black white

2799
02:22:59,584 --> 02:23:00,352
Not a good analogy

2800
02:23:00,864 --> 02:23:01,632
If that's

2801
02:23:01,888 --> 02:23:02,400
True

2802
02:23:03,680 --> 02:23:04,448
It works

2803
02:23:05,216 --> 02:23:09,056
Because everyone in front of the camera is a white dude

2804
02:23:10,080 --> 02:23:14,176
If he does have a completely diverse staff

2805
02:23:14,432 --> 02:23:17,248
But surprises leftist media that comes and shows up

2806
02:23:17,504 --> 02:23:20,064
That means he's intentionally holding some people.

2807
02:23:21,088 --> 02:23:24,672
Which is which is that good

2808
02:23:24,928 --> 02:23:25,952
You working

2809
02:23:32,608 --> 02:23:37,984
Do you realize all of our listeners are not allow people I call

2810
02:23:38,240 --> 02:23:39,776
I didn't watch the entire man

2811
02:23:40,544 --> 02:23:42,336
Yes I'm sorry

2812
02:23:42,592 --> 02:23:43,872
Break for a little while

2813
02:23:45,152 --> 02:23:47,200
Envy I would put it.

2814
02:23:47,712 --> 02:23:49,248
I would put it at

2815
02:23:49,760 --> 02:23:51,040
18 hours of it that I watch

2816
02:23:51,296 --> 02:23:52,064
Bully 2

2817
02:23:52,320 --> 02:23:53,088
Way too much

2818
02:23:53,344 --> 02:23:57,184
Way too much fat Indian dude who's running for congress did he win

2819
02:23:57,440 --> 02:23:57,952
I don't know

2820
02:24:00,512 --> 02:24:04,352
He's legitimately the only non-white

2821
02:24:04,608 --> 02:24:06,144
I saw in the entire time

2822
02:24:06,400 --> 02:24:09,984
Who's playing videos of Ashley Beckford shooting a gun

2823
02:24:10,496 --> 02:24:11,520
That's be only like

2824
02:24:13,056 --> 02:24:14,848
I admit I might have missed somebody

2825
02:24:15,104 --> 02:24:21,248
Don't think I did they keep all of their diverse people on the other 18

2826
02:24:22,528 --> 02:24:28,160
That was the plan the whole time night Chaka block with all these ethnic

2827
02:24:28,416 --> 02:24:29,696
Can gender minorities

2828
02:24:30,464 --> 02:24:33,280
Like I don't know man cuz I'm alright

2829
02:24:33,536 --> 02:24:34,048
South a

2830
02:24:34,304 --> 02:24:35,072
Slander

2831
02:24:35,328 --> 02:24:36,608
Guy who runs Gab

2832
02:24:36,864 --> 02:24:38,144
Anthony cumia

2833
02:24:38,400 --> 02:24:39,424
Gerald Celente

2834
02:24:39,680 --> 02:24:40,704
Jerome corsi

2835
02:24:40,960 --> 02:24:41,984
Owen Shroyer

2836
02:24:42,240 --> 02:24:43,776
This jacob angles guy

2837
02:24:45,056 --> 02:24:46,848
Rodger Stone

2838
02:24:47,104 --> 02:24:53,248
Tommy Robinson

2839
02:24:57,600 --> 02:25:03,744
Lipizzaner to believe Alec but if he is telling the truth

2840
02:25:04,000 --> 02:25:04,512
That's worse

2841
02:25:04,768 --> 02:25:06,304
That's very bizarre position

2842
02:25:06,560 --> 02:25:07,072
To be unlike

2843
02:25:07,328 --> 02:25:09,376
If you are this much of a open

2844
02:25:09,888 --> 02:25:10,400
I like

2845
02:25:15,008 --> 02:25:18,848
And it should drive home the fact that Alex

2846
02:25:19,104 --> 02:25:19,872
Just really wants your f******

2847
02:25:20,384 --> 02:25:24,224
Sick and tired of this video

2848
02:25:25,760 --> 02:25:27,808
I appreciate you out and only be clear

2849
02:25:28,064 --> 02:25:29,088
How to say this

2850
02:25:30,368 --> 02:25:30,880
It's real

2851
02:25:32,416 --> 02:25:33,440
Check my

2852
02:25:36,256 --> 02:25:37,536
Fred like pay for mine

2853
02:25:38,304 --> 02:25:39,840
Coffee at the gas station

2854
02:25:42,400 --> 02:25:45,472
All your gas you paid for the copies on me and I'm like

2855
02:25:50,848 --> 02:25:53,920
I don't deserve coffee but I'll tell you this

2856
02:25:54,432 --> 02:25:59,040
If you want to find the operator you want to buy the product they're trying to shut us down

2857
02:26:00,320 --> 02:26:01,088
What is that

2858
02:26:01,856 --> 02:26:04,160
I don't deserve for you to buy me a coffee

2859
02:26:04,416 --> 02:26:05,952
Spoken by a product

2860
02:26:06,208 --> 02:26:09,280
Look I don't want you to pay for half of my legal fees

2861
02:26:11,072 --> 02:26:11,584
F****** website

2862
02:26:13,888 --> 02:26:15,680
I am rich

2863
02:26:16,960 --> 02:26:18,752
My business is in trouble

2864
02:26:19,264 --> 02:26:23,360
I think more of it is like I don't want to barter

2865
02:26:24,128 --> 02:26:26,432
Money talks b******* walks

2866
02:26:26,944 --> 02:26:27,712
Buy a bra.

2867
02:26:28,736 --> 02:26:34,624
Except the only stretch of the show that was worth watching

2868
02:26:37,696 --> 02:26:40,000
Predictable ads all over the place in

2869
02:26:41,280 --> 02:26:41,792
Boring

2870
02:26:42,304 --> 02:26:48,448
Alex Jones these people the Ashley beckford's and the

2871
02:26:49,216 --> 02:26:49,984
Rob Jacobson

2872
02:26:50,496 --> 02:26:51,776
If they keep up this lawsuit

2873
02:26:52,288 --> 02:26:54,080
You're in real trouble

2874
02:26:54,336 --> 02:26:56,128
I think if they don't settle

2875
02:26:56,384 --> 02:26:57,408
You are in trouble

2876
02:26:58,432 --> 02:26:59,200
Man it'll be fun

2877
02:26:59,712 --> 02:27:00,480
But the other people come out

2878
02:27:00,992 --> 02:27:07,136
I really like to hear about like what other people's experiences were like working there

2879
02:27:07,392 --> 02:27:10,720
Gucciardi avechi

2880

I'm not going to make people a really long time ago

2896
02:27:58,592 --> 02:28:00,384
I'm going to do something that I think they'll like

2897
02:28:00,640 --> 02:28:01,664
Even more

2898
02:28:01,920 --> 02:28:04,992

02:28:09,600 --> 02:28:10,368
Okay

2901
02:28:10,624 --> 02:28:15,744
You just decided not to do it

2902
02:28:16,512 --> 02:28:17,792
No.

2903
02:28:18,304 --> 02:28:20,352
Not that I realized what I could do

2904
02:28:20,864 --> 02:28:21,632
Cuz I could make

2905
02:28:21,888 --> 02:28:23,168
A super long

2906
02:28:23,680 --> 02:28:25,216
Ridiculous soundbite

2907
02:28:28,032 --> 02:28:30,336
Play it for people

2908
02:28:30,848 --> 02:28:31,360
Haha

2909
02:28:31,616 --> 02:28:32,384
What I could do

2910
02:28:33,152 --> 02:28:33,920
I've decided to do

2911
02:28:34,688 --> 02:28:36,480
Create a 16 seed bracket

2912
02:28:37,248 --> 02:28:39,808

Muhammad Ali

2918
02:29:04,896 --> 02:29:06,688
I might have to rethink this

2919
02:29:06,944 --> 02:29:10,272
I won't renege on a really long sound bite if this is not

2920
02:29:11,296 --> 02:29:12,320
Some people like butt

2921
02:29:12,576 --> 02:29:13,344
I think we will like it

2922
02:29:15,136 --> 02:29:16,672
Everybody loves the bracket

2923
02:29:17,184 --> 02:29:17,696
That's true

2924
02:29:17,952 --> 02:29:20,256
Alex is mad

2925
02:29:20,512 --> 02:29:22,816
Anyway guys thank you so much for listening

Quick to sue

2930
02:29:42,528 --> 02:29:43,808
You're very racist towards white people
