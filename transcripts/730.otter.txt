Bray Andy in Kansas surely are. Huge fan. I love your knowledge by now knowledge fight.com

Dan  00:59
Hey, everybody, welcome back knowledge, right. I'm Dan. I'm Jordan. We're a couple dudes sit around worship at the altar of Slean. And talk a little bit about Alex June. Oh, indeed. We are Dan Jordan.

Jordan  01:08
Dan. Dan, quick question for you.

Dan  01:11
So that's a bright spot today, buddy. My bright spot today is the turning of a season the turning of a seat. Fall has sprung or however we put it Sure. And I it's getting a little chillier. Right maybe I think it's a little chillier in my apartment than it is even outside. Yeah, that is true. But I don't mind. I like I run hot generally. So I don't mind a little bit of cool weather. In the past. The cold has always signified one thing for me. Was that that cranberry splash Sierra Mist is right around the corner.

Jordan  01:44
I did not know that. That was cold based. That was the seasonal

Dan  01:47
variety of CRMs to cranberry is returning. I don't know I think it probably will be sometime like closer to December. More of like a wintry thing I see. But I've realized there's a new thing that's been incorporated pumpkin spice CRMs No. Okay, but it is an indication that I think I'm getting old. And that is I got so excited. I was at the Walgreens. And I saw that they had the soft Werther's Originals can be apple variety.

Jordan  02:16
Okay. Yeah, that is a sign that you're good to go these fall. I am shocked that you didn't immediately like give it to a child with a little piece of wisdom as you walked out was like,

Dan  02:31
this kid can't have it.

Jordan  02:32
I mean, the mall. That's fair. That's okay. Now we're back to you leaning out.

Dan  02:37
The Walgreens of all of them. There's there's a couple other flavors to that. I may try. There's a maple and a cinnamon. One that I might try. There's also a pumpkin, but I'm not into that.

Jordan  02:49
Are they allowed to call those Werther's Originals? Considering they're clearly not original? How the caramel is? Well, exactly. I mean, those you can call where there's originals. But what do you call the maple one

Dan  03:00
Werther's? Innovative, innovative, innovative. I like that. I don't know. It's great. Congratulations. Fall.

Jordan  03:08
I made I suppose where there's derivatives would be a little bit more accurate.

Dan  03:13
Yeah. All right. So I'm told man, we're gonna get it's time. It's time somebody handled this. Don't think you can go through email. Yep. Send a telegram. Right, right. Um, what's your brightspot

Jordan  03:24
by brightspot Is that my partner and I have we've kind of been on a fitness week. We've been we've been exercising going to yoga class every day doing the whole thing and it feels good. Feel, you know, be sure like to exercise you get your heart rate move. And definitely yeah, it is. It is like there's, there's certain spots, you know, I'm not like, Oh, I'm an old man. I'm 35 sure there are certain spots of my body that are not Werther's Original. I'm not I'm not telegram old just yet. But like, they're my knee is 68. Like, it's that kind of that kind of situation. So it's, it's it's good. And also very difficult to do one of these with my shoulder. Sure. It hurts a lot.

Dan  04:08
Well, I mean, you play a lot of tennis. So I imagine Yeah, the shoulders and the knees are things that Yeah, take a little bit of a hit. Yeah. There's more wear on that than on some of the other parts of your body. You are wrong. Well, but it's been good. That's good. Yeah. I wish you the best of that. I don't know what that feels like at all, ya know?

Jordan  04:26
So che five.

Dan  04:30
So Jordan, today we have an episode to go over? Yes. I decided after our last episode, where we talked about Alex's weekend excursion with Robert barn

Jordan  04:42
right where Barnes committed the crime. Yeah,

Dan  04:45
I decided I wanted to put Alex on timeout. I don't want it to be here's the thing. We you know, we've been watching the trial as its progressed over the week and this week has been a lot of family testimony. Yep. A lot of people telling very Moving and difficult stories of their, you know, their loved ones some some very heartening and bright stories about their lives. And then horrific tales of the abuse that they've suffered. I mean,

Jordan  05:15
yeah, it is. It is a emotional rollercoaster that is is like so extreme you know you you see them cry and in with with smiling happy tears at the at these joyful memories and then you are and then it's it's just, oh, it's intense. It's intense.

Dan  05:35
And one of the things that I keep hearing a bit too like that just just I don't know, maybe will haunt me is the the sort of consistency that you hear people describe one of the effects of the abuse that they get as like almost a denial of their self, you know, like, being asked, Oh, are you related to this person who died? It's any nope, that's not me. Right? You know, having to deny your sibling or your you know, your child, just for the sake of like, I don't want to deal with the possibility that they're one of those people who wants to yell at me. Right. Right. It's just, it's dark and, and challenging. I appreciate that. These people are getting this opportunity. You know, and it's very important. But I don't want to cover Alex is stuff right now. You know, like he did as bad of thing is he could do on Saturday, pretty much. I can't think of much more disrespect that he could give. And I don't want to be like we've talked about this. I don't want to be an Alex Jones. Chris Hardwick show or whatever. Yeah, talking Alex. Yeah, we're

Jordan  06:49
not a recap. Yeah.

Dan  06:51
And, you know, he can go on timeout. So we're going back to the past.

Jordan  06:55
Yeah. I don't know if he could get worse, but I don't think I'm interested in seeing him try. You know, like, we're we he did and he and Barnes stepped across that line. Last episode to a point where I'm like, why aren't we all suing them as a country as as a as a species? We should get together and like, include fucking rhesus monkeys because he's probably defamed them too. Like, we should be all suing him in barns for what they did class action. correctly. Yes.

Dan  07:29
Yeah. And that sounds silly. We're not talking. We're not talking about like Alex at all, as the trial progresses or anything or is present day stuff. It's too much. Yeah, you can, you can go sit over there. And we'll talk about the past. So we're going to talk about August 12 2003. Okay, continuing our path through 2003. And I gotta say, it's just what the doctor ordered it. I don't want to say okay, I often resist the urge to say we got a banger. Right. Okay. Okay. All right. This was great. Okay, there were two things that happen. Uh huh. That are just, man, they are restorative to the soul. Okay. Like, if you're listening to Alex Jones stuff, this is the kind of episode that you need to be like, Oh, you. So I'm glad to be able to provide that. Right. Right. Right. We will get to that in just one moment. But before we do, let's say hello to some new wall. Oh, that's great idea. So first, longtime walk first time listener, thank you so much.

Jordan  09:50
you so much. Yes, thank you very much.

Dan  09:52
Now Jordan before we dive into this episode, here's a fun out of context drop from today's show.

Alex Jones  09:57
Just so happens that I look like a tighter right now.

Dan  10:01
Just so happened.

Jordan  10:02
So happened. Just so happened.

Dan  10:04
You wonder what kind of apropos of nothing. I look like a potato just so

Jordan  10:11
happens. I look like a potato As luck would have it. I look like I mean as far as an intro to that state, but it really is a non sequitur that drives you insane.

Dan  10:21
Yeah, yeah, so happens. It

Jordan  10:24
reminds me of Louis blacks if it weren't for the horse. I never would have spent that year in college. Like I need so much more information than

Dan  10:34
that. Well, you will get none. Okay, so, here is where we start. Alex is in the mood where he wants to talk about big stories, but he can't.

Alex Jones  10:43
They're being shot and killed and grenaded and dying in their, in their barracks in Iraq. They're dying in Afghanistan. But that doesn't matter. Folks wall the wall everywhere. All anyone is talking about is Arnold Schwarzenegger running for Governor of California. And I know that he's charismatic. He's good looking. It's interesting. He's played this archetypal Hercules character. Oh,

Jordan  11:22
literal. Yeah, he's played actual Hercules image of him being

Alex Jones  11:25
the trooper male stamped on our psyche out and there's some German, a powerlifting champion and a lot of folks don't know that. He's also an atheist who makes in several of his books that I've read,

Dan  11:45
okay. So I think that literally everyone knows that Arnold was a powerlifting guy.

Jordan  11:51
That's how you that's what he is.

Dan  11:53
He was Mr. Universe.

Jordan  11:55
Nothing that that is. Yes.

Dan  11:57
Also Arnold represented Austria, not Germany. Yeah. Yeah, that's

Jordan  12:02
a small point. Different countries. Did you know that dance true Alex does not.

Dan  12:05
Also Arnold is not an atheist. He's a very public Catholic. Yeah. You may remember that his daughter Katherine married Chris Pratt, a couple years back and there's a bit of a public reckoning with the notion that not only Pratt but also Arnold's daughter, were pretty traditionalist Catholic for Yeah, you may also remember that Arnold is married to Maria Shriver, famously a member of the Kennedy family notable for the fact that JFK was the first Catholic President of the United States. There is that Shrivers mother Eunice was JFK sister. Right, right. I also have no idea what kind of books Arnold was writing before 2003. But looking into it, I found mostly bodybuilding memoirs with checks out make sense. And actually Alex does touch on this later. That is what he's talking about bodybuilding, but

Jordan  12:51
that's what

Dan  12:52
makes him an atheist. Yes. Well, he apparently mocked God.

Jordan  12:59
Because God can't lift weights as well as fuckin Arnold, can we know this?

Dan  13:04
I guess, come on. So there's a really fun thread that goes throughout this entire episode. That is like Alex is like, there's so many big stories to cover. But oh, no, I got to talk about Arnold. No one

Jordan  13:16
is making I don't think anybody's making him talk about art. Especially not that he

Dan  13:20
was very put upon that he has to talk about,

Jordan  13:24
you know, he wants to talk about the horrific nightmares going on. And I can't know about Arnold. Yep. Okay.

Alex Jones  13:32
Arnold said decades ago that he wanted to run for president or that he wanted to be the head of a national police force. And there's a good chance you'll end up being one of the two because he's in with the Illuminati. Right. He's married into the Kennedys and we will address Arnold Schwarzenegger. Or Arnold the black head. That's what his name means.

Jordan  13:55
Exactly. What Oh, okay.

Alex Jones  13:57
Means Arnold. The slave will discuss Arnold the Austrian. A little bit in the shower. Well, it

Dan  14:05
looks like Alex is a bit off on his prediction there about Arnold. Seems like he was just governor of California for a bit and now he makes videos with animals in his kitchen about how Trump is bad news and how he loves the people of Ukraine and the people of Russia. Yeah,

Jordan  14:18
he seems like he's having a way better. Post 2020 life he's killing it. Yeah,

Dan  14:24
another point. Alex is totally wrong about the etymology of Schwarzenegger. He's assuming that Schwartz means black and the second half of his name. Well, you can guess where I'm pretty sure that's where he's going with that. That was a popular piece of incorrect information that was flying around at this time and Alex saw it probably in a meme or some dumb blog and then just decided to pass it along to his audience as gospel Sure,

Jordan  14:48
sure. Sure. That's white dude. shithead stuff right there.

Dan  14:51
In reality the name comes from his ancestors being from a place called shorts and egg which is in modern day Austria. Shorts does mean black in this case. and egg is derived from the word meaning ridge. Schwarzenegger his name means person from the Black Ridge. point here is Alex's stupid and most of the things that he says mean absolutely nothing. Yeah, but he feigns this kind of like expertise or like this, this depth of knowledge that he has, which is really just like it's nothing.

Jordan  15:19
It's the confidence with which you deliver absolute made up nonsense then just you no matter how many times it happens, there is a reason con men have confidence in the name like that's just you in

Dan  15:32
that layer, right? You see what's underneath, and it's usually like, oh, just dumb shit. You don't even like I don't even think Alex probably thinks this is dumb. He probably believes that. That's true. Yeah, of course. Why wouldn't a while because he never takes the time to look into anything. So we need to?

Jordan  15:47
Schwartz right. I think he feels like 50% is is like I did that? You know, that's fair.

Dan  15:54
So we got we got Arnold on the docket. Now. He is he's very important. Yep. for governor. Yep. But Alex needs to take some calls. Because if you if you remember on our last episode, he was in John Stott Miller's studio. And so he couldn't take calls, right. So now we got to get to these calls is very important. Also, movies are real.

Alex Jones  16:15
So I do want to take time out to go to those calls today on any of the news items, any issue, any global story, national story, love story, something that you think is important that I should know about, for some propaganda you saw on the nightly news, or in a sitcom or drama, or in a movie because that's where more of the New World Order program is, is his shot at us than any other places in the mediums of, of fiction, on television and in print, as well as movies. So anything you want to discuss, it's it's wide open phones, if you disagree with me, if you want to confront me, if you want to show that I'm a liar, and that government is holy, and that government can do no wrong, and that it's conservative to turn your guns in. I disagree with that. I believe it's not conservative to have open borders and to turn your guns in and to be for an abortion. But again, I'm one of those old fashioned conservatives.

Dan  17:20
So that's, that's the way to disagree with you, is I call in and say that the government is holy.

Jordan  17:25
Yeah. Well, I can't be like, hey, maybe you're just wrong about stuff. This

Dan  17:30
means like this. This feels strong, Manny.

Jordan  17:32
I'm, I'm, I'm gonna guess based upon the length of time he's drawing out. Call me that maybe the show isn't as busy today, as he might have you believe so much yesterday. I really feel like I'm starting to think that maybe he doesn't have that much to talk about,

Dan  17:51
well, you'd be fucking wrong.

Jordan  17:53
I really don't think I would be

Dan  17:55
well, here's all the stuff he's not going to talk about today.

Alex Jones  17:58
Talk about Kobe Bryant. We'll talk about Arnold Schwarzenegger. We won't talk about the three dozen level for bio weapons labs are gonna build around the country. Why now that the Baltimore Sun reported the government said they're going to build systems that produce 1000s of gallons of liquid death. And they've had monkeys and stuff escaped from these in the past. Stuff that makes West Nile and smallpox look like mother's milk. We won't talk about that talk about how all the microbiologist that are in race specific bio weapon production who are all dropping dead we won't talk about that no time we won't talk about how they're putting in systems are shut down all the highways and walk down all the cities. What does that call it and talk about this in foreign trips publicly to impress the American people who won't talk about how they're openly building FEMA camps everywhere now to the mainstream news can't do it. Feel like he's drawing? Talk about how there's been more bombings in Israel or

Jordan  18:53
he could be talking about it now in this thing? Well, Pfizer,

Alex Jones  18:57
Oregon's being called

Caller 1 (730)  19:00
pneumonia unknown. He

Alex Jones  19:01
doesn't look liquefy your internal organs folks. Ebola does

Dan  19:05
no it doesn't. It's

Jordan  19:06
not liquid.

Alex Jones  19:09
Talked about how NASSCO, the UN organization that runs our public schools that want to increase funding for says that the family is the enemy and quote must be destroyed and is a quote disease quote no time. We won't talk about how they're putting cancer viruses in the vaccines.

Jordan  19:28
Sounds like he's got a busy show. He can't talk about all this stuff.

Alex Jones  19:33
It's the equivalent of talking about what color to paint your toenails when you're two inches from running your car off of a cliff over a 5000 foot ravine with spikes at the bottom. But we'll talk about it. So

Jordan  19:50
look, I'm gonna talk about who put those spikes at the bottom of that ravine.

Dan  19:53
If you were played Mortal Kombat, yes on the

Jordan  19:56
Yeah, totally. But

Dan  19:58
those spikes down there Sunday. Same guy. Okay. He's saying sins got a guy. Yeah. Okay, so look, it's all Alex's choice what he don't know if anybody can stop if he's so mad that he's like, Hey, I got to spend time on Kobe or Arnold Schwarzenegger, he should have just like chosen to cover what he wants, like his audiences clearly captured in the sense that they aren't going to leave him if he decides not to cover celebrity stories that he explicitly believes are beneath him. Yeah, they'd stick around, whatever. It's purely his choice of the thing that he wants to talk about. And he wants to talk about this because it's easy. Yeah. to pontificate about, like, celebrity type gossip style stories. Yeah. yelling about Arnold Schwarzenegger is easier than, you know. Like, what he just did there is covering these stories for him. Right. It's touching the surface of it. And they wanted to do Yeah, exactly. Yeah. He has nothing more to say about. Behind them. No, yeah. So just touch on it and move on.

Jordan  20:57
Make it sound like you're you're above.

Dan  21:00
But no, I have to. I'm so mad. I have to talk about Arnold Schwarzenegger. I can't The people demand that I do it. So okay.

Jordan  21:07
I mean, I love the idea. Like, in a tragic sense, this is that that almost Twilight Zone. And you know, like the TV journalist who's always stuck talking about, I don't want to talk about the cat stuck in the tree, you know, I want to be a real journalist. And then they capture the audience so they can finally talk about what they want to talk about. But realize that all they're capable of talking about is that cat stuck in the tree, right? Like it's a tragic situation. And

Dan  21:34
ultimately, that is what they want to talk about. Exactly.

Dan  21:38
Yeah. Yep. So it was great. Yeah. This is Alex's Black Mirror. So which is actually what Arnold Schwarzenegger saying. So Alex, take some calls. He gets a call from a guy who's been given out a bunch of his tapes. Now I know that we know from listening to Alex's show that the success rate with those tapes,

Jordan  21:59
90 plus percent of 90 north of 90, yeah,

Dan  22:03
let's see what this guy has to say. Okay.

Caller 1 (730)  22:04
Well, I've given out hundreds of your tapes and 50% of the people are lethargic and don't care. They, they, they're just lethargic. They just don't even they don't even know they just they watch it. They said, Yeah. They just have a look in their eye. And they don't have any comment. The second thing I do,

Alex Jones  22:24
they're not even they're not even in the ball game. That's true here a bunch of spectators, so I just feel sorry for them. They're like lemmings. What about the other 50% that listen?

Caller 1 (730)  22:37
I'd say 25% of the quarter the 50%. They care. They're passionate about it. Talk, we share videos, we swap videos, and we get involved. The other 25 are scared to death. And I think they're sitting on the fence. They don't know. Well, hey, 3%

Alex Jones  22:53
won the Revolutionary War. Okay, your

Dan  22:56
tone is a little different. Yeah, yeah. 90% of people who watch my tapes are waiting. All right. Well, you know, we only need

Jordan  23:03
three 3% is all we need, though. Like, we're happy you that 90% happens.

Dan  23:08
So first point, Those 50% aren't lethargic, they're polite. That's number one.

Jordan  23:13
Now they're lethargic. No, they're sleepy. They don't have the energy. They don't want to fight

Dan  23:18
again. Actually, maybe they're lethargic or tired to fight. You're right on

Jordan  23:23
us specifically, not the tape itself. They can take the tape. Yeah, that's fine.

Dan  23:28
And I noticed second thing that Alex is doing here, where he's like those people are they're not even in the game. Yeah. So I wonder if Alex's 90% excludes people who just like don't even want to bother. I'll watch this. I don't want to talk about it. Right? Right. This is stupid. I don't even want to fight you on this. So those people are removed, then you're artificially creating this imaginary 90% Sure, by excluding all of the people who don't even want to talk to you. Right, right. Just great. I mean, these seems like a cheat.

Jordan  23:57
Okay, if you were say, you're downtown, you know, handing out your mixtape, trying to get people to listen to your demo. 95% of people don't even want it. Don't even take it right. But some people do take it and the one person who comes back to you eventually and it's like, Hey, man, that was really good. That's 95% of the people that have listened to it. Probably. So you've got a 95% success rate, right? It's math.

Dan  24:23
If two people take your tape, right? And oh, boy, two is too small. One person comes back and says it's good. Right? But you've approached 1000 People Sure. That's a 50% success rate.

Jordan  24:37
That does sound right to be something like

Dan  24:39
that. Let's achieve the numbers. Yeah. So earlier, he said the movies are real and film is real and all this stuff. That's how they talked to us. And he wanted people to call in if they've seen if you see something say so

Jordan  24:52
if I've seen a movie that tells me a secret about the globalist that I can pretend to know about. I

Dan  24:57
need to hear about it right now. Alex is mad about this dynamic because he has to watch TV to get these messages. Yes, of course, he hates TV. He doesn't want to watch it. No, because it's evil. Exactly. But he has to watch. Well, they send messages. He can't rely on the audience to constantly tell him everything, all these messages that they're seeing in the television. Okay?

Jordan  25:19
If Alex doesn't watch TV, are they still sending Alex message? Yes,

Dan  25:25
through his listeners who call in and tell him about episodes of things that they've seen.

Jordan  25:30
Now, why has not why hasn't Alex made this like real attempt? You know, like, let's try and change the globalists behavior. Right. So I won't watch TV or talk about TV or let my audience talk about TV. And if they still want to get messages to me, they will have to send them through a different medium.

Dan  25:48
Well, here's, here's the actual answer to that. Okay. It's not just messages that they're sending to Alex. It's also like, you know, demoralizing the public through messages and stuff. So even if Alex isn't watching the globalists would have every reason to still do this naturally, naturally. So he's just monitoring for the right human demoralizing messages

Jordan  26:09
that they can send him messages is more of like a side, you know, bonus little bonus game that we can fuck with Alex and

Dan  26:16
the messages that they're sending are mostly the demoralizing things which Alex experiments or experiences as them taunting him. Gotcha. So there's that. That two way communication, right? Anyway, we could talk more about that episode of Frasier.

Jordan  26:30
That's a good idea.

Alex Jones  26:31
It's a problem for me because I need to watch the news the television. Right, I need to track and trace what they're doing and look at the propaganda and I still go to some movies, I, my watch videos, listeners, send me a specific stuff. It has been for weeks and counting. I watched while you were out with my wife last night when I got home. And I was reading bloodlines of the Illuminati again by Fritz spring Meyer, again, while she was watching while you were out where you know, you do the repair of the house or whatever. And I didn't even like that. So I gotta make television so much. And now it's good to the point where I can't watch it. I mean, it was becoming that upsetting when we talked about the Fraser episode where he joins the gun club, and his family. His friends all criticized him and what's wrong with him? This is crazy. This is evil. No, it's not bad. And he could do anything else. But this was bad. And then at the end, he goes into the basement and there's the gun club huddled around something whispering he says watch that they don't show it is that they say oh, it's it's a machine we're building to defeat the New World Order. And he screams in horror season runs out what it is, but the message is, there's the secret groups, they're armed by own guns. That's a sign of being a terrorist. They want to bring down the government. And Frazier was criticized by his whole family. And it turns out he was right. See, he fled out of the building. And you know, anybody that's in the guns and talks about a new world order is dangerous. And you better run screaming from him. I mean, I couldn't watch a movie. I couldn't watch a commercial I couldn't flip channels it just wall the wall evil. I can't handle it anymore. Vote turn it off. Then Deke

Jordan  28:34
Dan, everything must be made with my particular trigger warnings. alerted to me in advance. He does. Frankly,

Dan  28:44
he does sound a little sensitive. He sounds a little bit like he's triggered. Well, look, Alex hasn't seen this Frasier episode. Now he's just taking a little misrepresented details for Paul Joseph Watson's interview on yesterday's show, right. And then he's made up details to create a better story out of it. He has really basic plot points wrong like how it was Niles, not Fraser who got into guns, or more importantly, that it wasn't a gun club. It was that Niles and his dad went to a shooting range. The bigger aspect that Alex is really missing with this episode is that the shooting range and guns are treated as totally normal, safe and actually fun. Fraser's dad has a routine of going shooting and Niles is a stick in the mud. But after firing a gun, he realizes that it's really enjoyable and not that scary. Nothing about guns or even an issue that the episode makes look bad. It's the people that he met at the shooting range that are a weirdo New World Order dudes. And that wouldn't have even really been a problem except they were trying to get nails to come to their compound in Idaho, which is why Frazier's dad was worried in the first place. It's the compound in Idaho that's suspicious, not the guns.

Jordan  29:53
Fraser is portraying guns as a legitimate way for a father and son to bond deftly MIT Well, you know, that's like a real thing. Like Alex could be fixating on that and saying, like, look, look, the New World Order is that even the New World Order is like, you know,

Dan  30:07
we're like fine recreational activities. Sherif

Jordan  30:11
Ali, isn't that what you want people to think guns are?

Dan  30:15
I mean, at best, right, maybe isn't that what they want? So also, they weren't making a machine to fight the New World Order. It was and it wasn't in a basement. They were at that gun show and the dudes were looking at blueprints for a generator that they were going to need once the New World Order took over, which is what clued Niles in that he shouldn't go to Idaho with them. Anyway, the point is that Alex doesn't even watch TV to find these evil hidden globalist messages. You just hear secondhand retellings of plots, and then makes up stuff so he can ramble to his listeners about evil hidden globalist messages that aren't real. Yeah,

Jordan  30:49
yeah, they're not real. I mean, I think what's funny is that now, you know, back then, if I saw that episode, I'd be like, yeah, it's because those guys in Idaho are gonna be crazy, you know, that kind of thing. And now, it's like, I would run away from them, just because their stories are really boring. They're just they're made up. They don't that you weren't actually in the war, whichever one you're pretending to be.

Dan  31:11
And you know, you're imagining details into this. I am yeah, that was no, they were just nice guys.

Jordan  31:17
I'm imagining the Bundys that's what I'm imagining. I understand that but that wasn't part of the episode. Now. For your the Bundys did not feature heavily in Frasier episode nine, which would have been a true prediction. Yeah.

Dan  31:29
So Alex takes takes another call. And this person also wants to talk about his film. And this is kind of frustrating. At this point.

Caller 1 (730)  31:39
If we were to choose to copy two of them, which would be your choice.

Alex Jones  31:44
Probably 911. The road to tyranny and 911 The road to tyranny 911 The road to tyranny 911 The road to tyranny stage three total enslavement.

Caller 1 (730)  31:55
The least state three total enslavement. Okay, Alec.

Alex Jones  31:58
Hey, thanks a lot. Go ahead.

Fake Paul Revere   32:01
It's tremendous.

Alex Jones  32:03
Well, thank you so you're it's you're you're seeing and effect given people to videos. Well, that's great. Again, I don't really I'm not mad at Glenfiddich. You guys are great, but I don't talk about my videos. No, they are having an effect. And maybe somebody wants to comment about our No, all No.

Jordan  32:23
Because I thought you were the one

Alex Jones  32:26
version oh my god Docker respond to the diversion. See,

Dan  32:30
you understand what's going on here. Thank you, Alex. Passive aggressive. I set up the show talking about how I've got all these big things to talk about. But oh, we got to talk about Arnold expecting them to open up the phones. Everybody would want to talk about art. And that would justify his like, I've got to talk about I love to talk about these important issues. But then the callers aren't going along with it. He's frustrated. Yeah. They

Jordan  32:56
want to talk about our nope, god dammit. Yeah. So he comes back from break is trying to nag his audience to tell him about our knees just

Dan  33:04
a little bit frustrated. Oh,

Alex Jones  33:06
all right. I do have a bunch of news. We haven't even gotten to yet. But hey, we're not going to talk about it. We're going to talk about Arnold all day. And how important that is. Why we're not no one wants

Jordan  33:18
to know. literally nobody wants to nobody wants to. Absolutely. Come on.

Dan  33:22
What are you doing? The only thing I kept thinking as this was going on was like, well, this pageant is not working. The game he's trying to play is just completely laid bare in front of you. Yeah, so as I was listening to this, I was like, oh, that's the ball my needs. On a week like this. You don't want to talk about Alex in the present day. You hope to go back and see something like this happening on his show. Yes. Just delicious. Yeah,

Jordan  33:53
this is a this is a fantastic tripping up the stairs and falling onto a pie situation. Yeah.

Dan  33:58
So Alex has some other news. Not in that laundry list of things to share this. I don't I don't think this is true. Because it's not

Alex Jones  34:10
joined as a caller, in the last segment. mentioned that the American Bar Association just voted last week to strike down the attorney client privilege. Notice they always called it and this means now in any case, that your lawyer when you're there giving him information or preparing your case will go report on you to the prosecution and to the judge. Now. That is a 180 from what America was found it to be but it doesn't matter. They all wrap that in American flag. Patriotic if you don't do it.

Dan  34:54
This is this isn't true.

Jordan  34:56
That sounds that's that's such a great like oh If this were happening, I'd be furious, right? Yeah, no, I agree. It's not

Dan  35:04
I imagine this has something to do with there being some exceptions to attorney client privilege. If you're trying to witness tamper or like, destroy evidence,

Jordan  35:17
like, Hey, you want to commit a murderer with me later,

Dan  35:19
your attorney doesn't have to maintain privilege if they're trying to be involved in a crime with you, or whatever. The crime fraud provisions allow for that to be breached.

Jordan  35:33
The lawyer man lie for me, I can't do that. I mean, I have to tell people that you said that Sorry, man,

Dan  35:40
or you even don't have to, you could just, you could just remove yourself as attorney, but you can break the privilege in those cases. I don't know. Anyway, there's other news,

Alex Jones  35:50
locally. And, again, we're not going to talk about how they've announced they're gonna build three dozen giant, level four bio weapons labs that produce stuff worse than smallpox. So you're taking another swing at this, then anthrax, super weaponized Ebola. Super weaponized smallpox. A Level three is just smallpox or interaction. A level four is weaponized.

Dan  36:21
Seat. Now, this is why I'm saying he just when he lists off the things that he's not gonna talk about, that is him talking about it. Yeah, that's all he's back to it. And it's just the same thing. And also, what he just said, is so not true. If Alex actually thinks that level four labs are for weaponized things that explains a lot of his dumb ideas, but he's just making that up. The distinction between level three and four are the things that are studied in level four labs are, quote, infectious agents or toxins that pose a high risk of aerosol transmitted laboratory infections and life threatening diseases for which no vaccine or therapy is available. Both use very high levels of safety protocols, but understandably, for things that are, you know, studied and level four, they need greater control, right? Smallpox and Ebola are absolutely not level three pathogens. They're studied in level four labs. Yeah, he's just, he has no idea of the things he's talking about.

Jordan  37:16
I I'm just gonna throw this out there. I'm the globalists. I'm trying to figure out where to put my weaponized stuff. I'm not just going to give it a blanket lay level. I'm not just gonna be like, Oh, by the way, to the whole world, in case you're wondering all of my level four laboratories, that's where I weaponize things,

Dan  37:36
right? Take a swing, take a bite at this apple. Totally level five, five, it

Jordan  37:41
could just be level five.

Dan  37:42
That would explain why there's no records of any of this. It's all clandestine, make it

Jordan  37:48
a secret level. I find if there was a weaponized lab level, I wouldn't tell people about it. It would be a

Dan  37:55
secret. It's a slam dunk. Yeah, yeah. There's

Jordan  37:59
a whole nother level for that. Do

Dan  38:00
better. So look, there's another really fun thing that happens on this episode. The first thing is that Arnold charade falling apart, yes. Delightful. One wonderful first hour of the show, just what a chef's kiss. Absolutely. There's another really fun thing that happens for the like the last hour of the show. He talks about a different episode of Frasier. I wish Yeah, it's you do with fun in a different way. Yes. Unfortunately, there's some anti semitism we got to get away there they go. This is weird. Alex is upset that people are mad at the Passion of the Christ still sure. And he says something strange okay.

Alex Jones  38:36
And oh, but but Mel Gibson make something wholesome. And his dad comes on the show and talks about decent, wholesome things is the passion of the family as listeners of this network, we appreciate them one thing and there I got articles today. The film is going to be boycotted by the Southern Poverty Law Center, the ADL because it shows the Pharisees calling for Christ to be killed well, that's not anti semitic. I mean, Jesus was a semi Palestinians are Semites to the Jews are Semitic? Just means you're from that area. When that's how crazy it's gotten. Jesus is now racist books. And they actually say that in there that the the New Testament is racist. And there's moves in Europe to ban it. I read the BBC News articles. Because price points his finger at him and says, you know, you're evil, you're corrupt. You're of the devil. He was talking to the establishment Pharisee talking about the Jews as a whole. He was talking about Jews that didn't accepting

Dan  39:50
Ah, I see.

Jordan  39:55
Boy, yeah, not he wasn't talking about Jews just the specific subset of Jews that don't agree with him, thus setting off an ability for us to hate them for the rest of our lives. I don't understand what that what about what's the problem there? Haha, no big deal. What? No, he just chooses to hate every Jews. Oh no Now I'm getting it.

Dan  40:20
Yeah. So there's, we've talked a bit already about the Passion of the Christ and the problems with it Mel Gibson's dad met so many problems with so many problems Holocaust denial and such he's still allowed to be in movies. And so yeah, that's the way Alex's framing that there at the end is bizarre. Yeah, that is, I just I don't understand how these things can just, they can come out of his mouth and he doesn't recognize Hey, this is what I'm saying. You cannot

Jordan  40:48
say things. Yeah, there are things you can choose not to say. Yeah,

Dan  40:53
yeah. So we have one more clip before we get to the really fun thing. And it's Alex reporting on a story that is not

Alex Jones  41:01
and then they got the world of wonder channel for Salah wonder that's production company channel forged in Persia is a group doing it over in over in England, where they're going to put a bunch of 10 year olds together to have sex in a house. And that's normal. Now that's horrible.

Unknown Speaker  41:18
So would be oh, there would be

Alex Jones  41:22
minded and the Scotland Yard diversity unit may arrest you. Now that the Scotland Yard is arresting people, if they criticize that,

Caller 1 (730)  41:34
that's absolutely horrible.

Dan  41:35
Scotland Yard's diversity unit is going to come after you if you criticize an alleged show where they put 10 year olds in a house to have sex with each other.

Jordan  41:43
I mean, that's ridiculous. Just so I do appreciate that. That is kind of the bread and butter of radio, though. There's a little bit of like, did you hear this? Did you hear this in the news? I read recently don't quote me on this. I read that somebody somewhere in some government said that they were going to replace the sugar and ice cream with bird feces law. Can you believe this? Or it is the government out of control. Okay, they've run amok.

Dan  42:12
I will say though, I recently went back and I was watching all of the Agatha Christie Paul row. So yeah, and there was one where poro and Colonel Hastings were sitting around having a conversation and chief inspectors app came in and he was just complaining from a hard day of sure arresting people for criticizing the show. This is just

Jordan  42:39
smiling at me.

Dan  42:42
He's not French, he is Belgian. So we get to this. Yes. Alex has a guest. That's actually two guests. Okay. But he only is really giving an ID and play. I wish, man that would be great. If a house party. Yeah, that would be great. But it's a guy named Paul Revere. Not real name.

Jordan  43:02
Yeah. Well, I Yeah.

Dan  43:04
I want to say one thing really quick. If I'm Alex Jones, I'm not accepting bookings for people with aliases. No,

Jordan  43:11
no. Especially Revere. I can't trust you. Come on, man. So Paul Revere trust car paid doctor more than somebody who changed his name to Paul Revere. You're a liar.

Dan  43:22
Yeah. He's a pastor of sorts. Sure. And Alex recently heard him on another guy's show this guy named John Anderson, who's a guy, I think he has a voice of ministry or voice of truth or something. It's another show on Genesis one of those. And so Paul Revere has some thoughts about Romans 13. Now, as we know, Romans 13 is one of the things that Christian folk, like Alex are really mad about, right? Because it's this. It's this scripture that they think is going to be used by the new world order to convince everyone that Christians need to submit to authority and right, have you so they believe that this is a twisting of Scripture, and they were very, very upset

Jordan  44:05
if they're real mad about something in their book. Yes, yeah.

Dan  44:08
So this is what Paul Revere his bread and butter is. I will allow Alex to give an introduction. And then I have a fun story to tell you. Here we go.

Alex Jones  44:17
I'm about to go to my guests here in a few minutes. But let's keep them on hold for just a second because I want to introduce them first. And then I want to plug my videos. Paul Revere is a well known minister, non establishment minister in the US, and they have their peaceful community attacked by tanks, smash and crash and he was chased in the woods by him and all that happened and substantive, much larger, globally, talking about Romans 13, and how the churches say that we're supposed to follow all orders of the government. The government is basically God. This was one of Hitler's most My favorite things to promote and say, it's taken totally out of context. The new Bibles are being edited and changed and altered in amazing ways. And so even if you're not a Christian, this is very interesting because it's kind of that Orwellian memory hole where history is being altered all around us and in front of us. And I heard Mr. Revere yesterday on the air with with John Anderson, who is on the network. I know a lot of people don't agree with him some do. I'm not getting off into a debate about eschatology versus other interpretations of the Bible. But I do agree with with Mr. Mr. Anderson, about his comment that a lot of the churches lie down and say, we're not supposed to be involved, because, you know, Jesus is gonna come back and do it all. For us. This is very important to understand what's happening inside the New World Order.

Dan  46:06
So put a pin in Alex's disagreement about eschatology, right, right. Here we go. might come up later,

Jordan  46:13
man, you know, you know if your book can just like, be edited. And then that's it, then it wasn't that holy of a book in the first place? You know?

Dan  46:25
Well, there, there are some arguments you can make on that front. I would rather focus on the fact that you have pre and post trib rapture ideas. Sure. And people who believe different things about that tend to fight with each other. They

Jordan  46:40
get real mad because Alex is not a pre trib guy. You got to go through it to do it.

Dan  46:46
This might come up. Oh, now I want to talk about Paul Revere. Okay. All right, here we go. So he was on John Anderson's show talking about how Romans 913 is bullshit. Yeah, and that's fine. I don't care. I'm not interested in that. We're not gonna argue what I'm interested in is the scam that Revere was working that he doesn't bring up at all on this show. Okay. And I don't know if he thinks it's a scam. I think he doesn't, okay. Part of Paul Revere. His philosophy is that you are a citizen of the country that you're born in. And when you're reborn in Christ, you are now a citizen of heaven. That's something I can go along with as a metaphor. But I need to make it clear to you that revere means this literally,

Jordan  47:28
are you going to tell me that he is going to sell some sort of citizenship passes?

Dan  47:34
He runs a church called the Embassy of heaven. And there's a reason it's called the embassy. He gives people passports to heaven through his website, he sells fake documents. No, he claims can be used instead of US government documents, like a passport or driver's license because you're a citizen of heaven, or even enrollment in quote, mutual assurance, which appears to be some kind of fake insurance. All right, also, there's business licenses. Cars.

Jordan  48:04
So he's creating an alternative government and just calling it f and

Dan  48:09
v like documents office of it. Yes. Appreciate that. So beyond selling fake official documents, is probably illegal. Oh, it's all illegal. Revere has also created a bunch of fun civic information about the country of heaven. For instance, he takes things that are mentioned in the Bible and then uses them as official symbols of the country. Oh, that's nice. I have four things. Okay. That I'm going to ask you and you have to guess what they are. Okay. What is the national musical instrument of heaven? Ooh, this one you should be able to get?

Jordan  48:40
I mean, you know, you could go with a liar, right?

Dan  48:44
Because so much like liar. When it's true. Well, actually, I think there's probably a number of options on this you could also go harp

Jordan  48:51
right but harp C I was gonna think harp but that's that's not going to draw people into your embassy of heaven. Everybody already thinks the harp and they have it's a trumpet. Oh, it's a trumpet.

Dan  49:00
Trumpets. Oh, that's fair. What is the national animal of Heaven?

Jordan  49:06
The dove. No,

Dan  49:08
that's the national bird national animal national.

Jordan  49:16
Night think of why is it Bernadette? i Lion,

Dan  49:20
huh? No. last land Lamb of God.

Jordan  49:23
Oh, fuck off. What are you blanking me Shut up.

Dan  49:28
Next. 1/3 You're over to so far.

Jordan  49:30
Yeah, no, I'm not doing great on this. I'm gonna get kicked out. Right.

Dan  49:34
The National Dance. Ah,

Jordan  49:37
ooh, the LaMotta for

Dan  49:41
leaping for joy.

Jordan  49:46
Leaping for joy is the dead

Dan  49:49
national dance of heaven.

Jordan  49:53
Okay, all right. And then finally, leaping for joy. It's a good day. Oh, you're that rock. So

Dan  49:59
A national song of heaven I

Jordan  50:03
mean, what? Why not? Oh did joy?

Dan  50:06
Hmm. They'll be there'll be an interesting, traditional. It's My Country Tis of the

Jordan  50:10
explain to me how that is possibly.

Dan  50:15
First it doesn't even fit the pattern. What are you talking about? Everything else is stuff that's mentioned in the Bible. Like a three tenths of the shirt and the name of that song is actually America. Yeah, I was gonna say My Country Tis of Yeah, and the dude who wrote it just stole the tune from God Save the Queen. It was basically a parody song. Yeah.

Jordan  50:33
All right. Okay, boy.

Dan  50:37
So yeah, this guy's got a website called The Embassy of heaven. And it's a lot he has a whole section about his encounters with police.

Jordan  50:51
Yeah, that's, that is the type of thing that you would experience a lot if this was your church. Yeah.

Dan  50:56
So he's driving around one day and he sees some cops Sure. And so he pulls over this is after he had gone to the post office because he had to do some official business right for the I'm gonna throw this out here to see if guy equips you haven't. White Guy. only seen a small picture of him, but I would, I would guess so. So he, he goes down down the street and quote, at the same time, Quinton Stott thought, a city of Slayton police officer was traveling north on Center Street and recognize the Embassy of Heaven vehicle, he decided to intercept us. After circling the block, he realized that we were headed out of town toward the embassy. We were about three blocks ahead of him and he traveled at a high rate of speed to catch up with us. After leaving the city limits I turned on to the long driveway of our friend's place. Quinn also entered the private property and turned on his overhead lights. We stopped in front of the garage and Quinn pulled up behind us. I opened my door and started to exit the car. Quinn stepped out of his car and yelled for me to remain in the car. Rather than cause a scene I remained seated in the car and close the door. No, it's Quinn was talking on the radio. I asked Rachel How to handle the situation. She had no answer. We both realized that it had been five years since being stopped and I was pretty rusty. Two unmarked cars arrived within moments. One of the persons in the first car was the chief of police quit and approached this my side of the car and stood slightly behind me. He asked to see my driver's license and registration. I asked if he was tape recording, and he said he was not. Rather than answer his question I stated, I am an ambassador of Jesus Christ with the kingdom of heaven. I am using the highways in the Kingdom of Heaven and the performance of my official duties to evangelize the Kingdom of Heaven according to the Great Commission.

Jordan  52:41
All right, sir. I'm gonna have to ask you to step out into the car. I had

Dan  52:45
declared my intent which showed I was operating under the highest authority yet Quinn ignored my statement and repeated his question. May I see your driver's license registration?

Jordan  52:54
I want more. I want more info about how he rates a chief of police stop as well, like the Chief of Police is also in

Dan  53:01
the small town. Actually the chief of police. So maybe made up Fair enough. I was not quite sure how to handle the situation. So I said that I needed some time to think about it. Quinn said he would give me a few minutes and he returned to his car and talked with the undercover people. When he returned he asked me if I was Paul Revere. I responded by saying yes I am Paul Revere. Got nearly a figure.

Jordan  53:29
That's the moment that's the moment if I'm Paul Revere of like everything I've ever worked for just paid off in that moment when the cop goes, aren't you Paul Revere? Yes, you better believe it's

Dan  53:43
a third time may I see your driver's license and registration. Probably a little bit slower this time I have responded I have documents at the Embassy of heaven and I also have documents with me if I give you these documents will you what will you do with them? And you responded if it is those church documents I will not recognize Okay, well I guess that's settled step out of the car you're under arrest

Dan  54:13
running to the police Yeah, that

Jordan  54:15
sounds about right. And

Dan  54:16
I was pretty curious about this story because I was like why did you get pulled over in the first place right and then I scroll down a little bit further and there's a section here and the title of the section is heaven plates removed that's

Jordan  54:27
kind of what I was waiting for. Waiting for some sort of Heaven reason being the like, Dude, you You've lit your own lights up with candles that's not how cars work gotta

Dan  54:39
stop it. He made his own embassy of Heaven license plates which is gonna get you pulled over. But I'm amazed he made it a couple of years without getting pulled over. By the way that guys like, are you Paul Revere? I imagine maybe there's like, no, there's

Jordan  54:54
there's absolutely there's no doubt in my mind that he gets away with that just because the more Are you the more you bother him, the more he's gonna bother you? It's more proof

Dan  55:03
of his own persecution code likes. And yeah, what you do. It's also

Jordan  55:08
proof that all of these laws are fake and made up and are only enforced based upon the willingness of the law to enforce itself upon us, Dan, you know what I'm saying? You could just say no to the cops,

Dan  55:20
I wouldn't do it. So while they're having a conversation about Romans 13, everything's going good. And Alex believes that these are smart, smart people.

Alex Jones  55:35
And Martin, are and others holding, we'll get your calls early in the next hour. And I'm interested to see how Paul Revere and John Anderson respond to all of them, because they're both very intelligent men, and are definitely saying a lot of things that are different than what we hear from a lot of the mainstream folks out there. We're just trying to get folks to think here, pal. Yeah,

Dan  55:58
let's think,

Jordan  56:00
Ah, I don't think they're gonna get people to think I'm thinking

Dan  56:03
about some stuff. Yeah. Are you I'm thinking about. All right. So here we have this guy, Paul Revere, right. And he's on with John Anderson, who they're clearly associates. They seem to like each other. He's been on Anderson's show. Sure. And Paul Revere believes that the United States doesn't exist, or at least he's not beholden to any of these laws, because he's a citizen of heaven. It doesn't anybody who's born again in Christ should to be a citizen of heaven. So he doesn't really care too much about America. Right? Founding Fathers. Yeah. Well, their constitution. Wow. And maybe this comes up. Oh,

Alex Jones  56:45
John Anderson, you were trying. We're trying to make a point here, about Romans 13. And what the King James Version clearly says and how they take it out of context. They are Go ahead.

John Anderson   56:59
Okay. Here's an example. Alex bankfull served to show the point, if I ask you because you did a lot with this to name three. Founding Fathers right off the top of your head. Who would you name?

Alex Jones  57:12
Thomas Jefferson, George Washington, Thomas Paine?

John Anderson   57:16
Okay, exactly what if I named Peter, John and Paul going in when we read the Bible with the preconceived ideas that's we come up with with the wrong answer.

Dan  57:31
Yeah, man. You're small minded thinking about America? No, no, no, the country was founded by the apostles.

Jordan  57:38
That is such the fuckin Eckhart Tolle, like giving a speech way of doing it. Let me ask you a question. Who are your three best businessman? Oh, yeah. I'll tell you who mine are Jesus Christ Himself. Okay, all right, bad. All right. Okay.

Dan  57:57
Yeah, pretty good. Pretty good. So this is where things started to feel like this could get this could get messy. I'm not sure where this is gonna go. And quicker than I imagined. It did get into ideas about the rapture, and they are not on the same page. Here we

Jordan  58:17
go. Now for just

John Anderson   58:18
a moment. And as you know, I'm a preterist. The voice of reason, teaches Preterism period as far as eschatology or last things, which means past fulfillment now, but let's say for a moment that you are a futurist one that believes the book of Revelation has yet to be fulfilled.

Alex Jones  58:33
We got to stay right there. Look, all I'm saying is, I agree with Paul Revere, I agree with you about Romans 13. That's clearly talking about the other stuff. We'll get back. I don't know about that.

Dan  58:44
So here's the thing to understand. This is not even an issue of post or pre trib rapture

Jordan  58:49
he's denying that the rapture even happens because he's saying that the Book of Revelations was already fulfilled

Dan  58:54
yeah by JESUS IS COMING yeah the entirety of the that all that shit so he is already it's already done. The devil is gone.

Jordan  59:03
We banged it out now we're now we're we're waiting to get our passport to get into the Coney Island of heaven. Or that No. Coney Island to Coney Island. So what I was thinking of for sure.

Dan  59:19
Get a grace papaya of heaven. Yep. So I Alex can handle this. And one of the reasons that I really feel coming through strongly is that Alex needs the devil. And yeah, this will put to bed very efficiently. Whether or not Alex believes in the literal devil and 2003 Like, he definitely does. And there is such an aversion on his part to living in a world without the devil right? He needs the devil. Sure.

Jordan  59:52
I mean, once again, reinforcing my belief that he is the actual Satan worship here, you know, based upon what he described Satan where are stripping people the noises they make or the noises he makes cool, you know, it's it's the way it works. I think it's

Dan  1:00:06
not worshipping the devil on Alex's part. But I think the devil is something of a comfort blanket for

Jordan  1:00:11
sure, just very weird somebody else's fault.

Alex Jones  1:00:14
You don't need to have these guys on, I guess, when we're not in such a hot new cycle of all this worldly stuff that we track here. But I heard him yesterday talking about Romans 13. And the I've read the Sunday school, I've read the Romans 13, out of the King James Version. And you look at what the whole chapter says, and it's about the church and how the church should behave and how the church should be governed and how you should you know, how you should behave. And then they take it and they translate it and change it into worship the government following any orders that it has to say, and Hitler use this. And it's just it's so dangerous. And then John Anderson, who's a preterist, they believe that, you know, in 70 ad that got that slave Bible now all have the, you know that Jesus finished his work and that now the only evil the chair's evil a man and the devil is gone. We want to talk about this, that's fine. We can take calls on the issue of people are saying, Well, wait, you know, we'd have a religious show. This affects the psyche of the world, folks, whether you believe in God or not. This affects the psyche. And I know a lot of these big churches can't stand up against evil because they say, Oh, we're about to get, you know, taken out of here. And it's not our responsibility. My Bible says it is your responsibility to stand up against the worst of darkness, to speak out against evil to fight corruption.

Dan  1:01:40
They are not disputing that really, right. They are still bad. It's just bad people who are doing bad things, who are outside of this kingdom of heaven that exists on earth. Like there's still like an obligation to be a good person and be opposed to bad things. Yeah,

Jordan  1:01:57
the Bible doesn't go away if Romans I mean, yeah, right. Yeah,

Dan  1:02:01
it's, it's interesting. And then Alex is trying to twist it to now to be the poster pretrib there with these churches that are saying that we're about to be taken out here. That's not what these guys are. Fries are different.

Jordan  1:02:16
See, this is the type of shit that makes me want to, like really get people to understand why Christian nationalism is bad. You know, like, sure, you say you want a Christian nation, but are you a futurist or preterist? You know, like, what are we what are we doing here? Because you don't fucking know what Christianity fucking is.

Dan  1:02:34
Yeah, the breakdowns of like, really, really aggressive disagreement is insane, right? I mean, it's the same thing with like, all right. I want statehood and state sovereignty, right. It's like, all right, I'd like to introduce you to the king of Texas. Oh,

Jordan  1:02:49
no. Well, now I don't know if I want that. Oh, I didn't think about how this could go wrong.

Dan  1:02:55
Yeah, there's unforeseen consequences. Yeah. But yeah, it's just I think that Alex has an idea of how things operate and the way his mythology and the cosmos to him, it requires cosmic evil, right? It requires the bad guys on his side not be bad people doing bad things, or good people who are parts of bad systems, or neutral, it has to be something of this mythological good versus evil struggle. And you can really just I that's what I feel coming through in in his opposition.

Alex Jones  1:03:36
And I tell you, I listen to the show. And it's, it's confusing, because I agree with some things. They say I see the problems with a modern church that says lay down the corruption go along with it. And then I hear these guys saying that. Well, I've heard him say these guys are talking about the new world order all day. I get sick of it. I heard Anderson say yesterday, because because you know, the answer is right here in our hearts and souls and minds. If we just come to Christ, we wouldn't have an evil society. Well, you said it best are still going to be evil people, they're still going to come in army tanks, and try to kill Christians, just like they do all the time. So I've got to expose China killing Christians, I've got to expose the government kidnapping children, I've got to expose them putting cancer viruses in the vaccines, because that is saving lives. And we are saving lives. So you know, this is very confusing stuff. And yeah, I know, you guys. It's not confusing. That must be very comfortable place to be in. But I'm just very confused.

Dan  1:04:42
Alex is confusing himself. Yeah. Because they're not saying you shouldn't talk about or talk out about any of those things necessarily. It's just that maybe the New World Order isn't the devil. Right, right.

Jordan  1:04:53
I think I mean, like, we you know, deep down my fear that my My feeling on it is Alex finds it very, very comforting to think that there are people that can override, you know what I'm saying. So like, no matter what, at the end of the day, you've got a, I don't need to take responsibility for my actions card, you know what I'm saying? Like, that's why the devil, that's why God exists is because at the end of the day, I am in their, you know, sway, I'm just part of their little struggle or whatever it is, you know, sure, I don't have to look at myself in the mirror and say, I'm responsible for every single thing I've

Dan  1:05:34
ever done. I'm in the arena, but it's their arena. Exactly, you know? Yeah. I think there's something to that. And then I also think that because Alex is so obsessed with this idea of this tyrannical one world government, it's the entire world. And it's like, All right, what's above the world? Well, it's got to be cosmic forces and travel and stuff. You can't just be like, what? President of the world as a human. Right, right. Have that know that? So then there's the other aspect to that I think that is narcissism based. And that is Alex sees himself as such a conquering hero, right, that he must be up against the great evil in the entire universe. Yeah, sure. And have some kind of hubris that thinks he can actually defeat this devil. Right, right. I think that it would be unsatisfying for him to just be like, somebody who's like, Okay, I see a problem. I'm going to work towards an actual solution to it. Yeah, okay. Yeah, you you know, you rebuilt someone's house after natural disasters,

Jordan  1:06:37
then well, then now what do we do? Do we fight somebody?

Dan  1:06:40
That's not I mean, there's gonna be a devil. So do you? Do you like do you kill the devil now?

Jordan  1:06:44
Is that what happens next? It's

Dan  1:06:45
not as gratifying to to like sort of be a part of working towards helping and solving real issues. Yeah, it is gratifying to imagine everything you do whether it is productive, or a mistake, or stupid. All of those things are part Oh, or you're misinterpreting a Fraser episode there is that all of that is fighting the fucking devil. I mean, like, grandiose way to live your life. And I imagine. Yeah, and you know, if you empty

Jordan  1:07:17
with with that kind of narcissism, you know, the devil is his nemesis. It's not as archenemy you know, like the arch enemy. You would be fine. Defeating that'd be the Nemesis. You would feel Yeah, exactly. If he defeated you, right? He'd be like, hurray, we defeated Dan. You know, like, we got him. But if he defeats the devil, he's like, Well, then who's gonna push me? You know who's gonna make me more holy? That kind of feeling? It's his nemesis. Knights sharpens knife, but

Dan  1:07:45
it is. Well, that's not how knives were. No. And also there isn't a second knife.

Jordan  1:07:51
It's an imaginary knife. Yeah. I don't know air sharpens knife.

Dan  1:07:55
So this, this aspect will come up more later, this absence of the devil in their worldview and how this is like, incompatible? Sure, but the not liking America thing is great. Yeah, this is so fun. Here we

Alex Jones  1:08:11
go. Where do you stand then, on the founding fathers of this country standing up to England? I mean, because again, this is where it gets a little confusing.

Fake Paul Revere   1:08:22
Well, it's real simple. Alex, if you take a look. Well, from Scripture, Jesus says that good seed produces good fruit. Bad seed produces bad fruit. Not produce bad, bad cannot produce.

Jordan  1:08:37
Good. Gregor Mandela.

Fake Paul Revere   1:08:39
What did be the United States, the people that de us to that time those who refer to as the founding fathers of the country in America? Where did these people come from? Not all Deist. Now the majority of them were in

Alex Jones  1:08:56
third, some of the prominent ones were

Dan  1:08:58
alright, a third of all the famous one.

Jordan  1:09:01
What do you what kind of waigani responses? Okay, well,

Dan  1:09:04
most of them were just quibble. Anyway. So he's saying that good cannot come from bad, right? And he elaborates on that here. Okay.

Fake Paul Revere   1:09:11
Point is they came from England. It was a teenager who had grown up and said, I want a piece of the action. I don't want the mother country to rule us, we want to rule ourselves. So that's really where it came from. Therefore, they were fighting their own kin. They were fighting, but they wanted they wanted to be a teenager that grew up, did it come out of Ecclesia? Did it come out of the kingdom of God? No, it cannot possibly have came out of the world. And they even in their own declarations declared, we take equal station among the powers of the earth.

Alex Jones  1:09:52
Well, I'm glad they did what they did. Or we wouldn't even exist right now.

Fake Paul Revere   1:09:58
We don't know that. Oh, Oh, come

Alex Jones  1:10:00
on, you're saying that nobody Jones and Paul Revere, you're even named after one of them wouldn't have existed. I mean, look, we wouldn't exist right now it was obviously God's plan. I mean, you think God just just just turned things on and just turns it loose?

Fake Paul Revere   1:10:24
They did it. I think he did. In fact, at one point, he repented that he even made man, and he desired to destroy the whole world.

Jordan  1:10:33
Why are you worshiping that guy? Love it real quick, real quick. You said your God was like, oh, I should have killed everybody. I don't want I don't want to worship that guy.

Dan  1:10:42
Wow. I mean, he does make a good point to Alex's, you know, bottle to find a rebuttal

Jordan  1:10:48
to find rebuttal. Yeah. Ah, so

Dan  1:10:50
Yeah, apparently to, obviously, if you could understand anything about what these people actually believe, you would know that they can't possibly be in favor of the United States, the founding document, the founding fathers, all of that stuff. But here's what's interesting about this, a lot of the beliefs that you have could still overlap your cause, according to Alex, so many of these things that are in the Constitution are actually God given rights. And so they preclude or they predate the right, the Constitution, right? Those are things that the government cannot do to you as opposed to rights that they give you. So coincidentally, if he believes or if like Paul Revere and John Anderson both are like, everybody should have all the guns, they could still believe that with or without a belief in the Constitution. Right, right. But I don't think Alex would ever let the conversation get there, right? Because it's so much he needs the Constitution, right? In the same way that he needs the devil. He needs that in order to have his God given right,

Jordan  1:11:58
right or whatever. But he doesn't actually care about the Constitution. He cares about the idea of the Constitution that he's created. Like, he doesn't like all of the Constitution, and if he hadn't, he doesn't like it. Like he'd scratch them out as a couple, you know, like, it is a stupid, stupid conversation whenever he's like, No, the Constitution isn't violent. I mean, I would get rid of this amendment. I would get rid of this part. I don't want to deal with this freedom of religion. Get that out. We should also

Dan  1:12:23
outlaw the Democratic Party.

Jordan  1:12:25
Exactly. Like okay, so why are you arguing with him about whether or not the founding fathers were 100%? Right about everything because

Dan  1:12:32
Alex is on his back foot. You know what he's doing? So student interviewees shouldn't do so stupid. So, look, there's no devil, but what do you mean? Do you know that? Well, that's what John Anderson Oh, okay. Oh, by the way, Paul Revere barely in this interview. Yeah,

Jordan  1:12:46
it does seem like

Dan  1:12:49
Alex arguing with each other. Okay. But Alex wants to know, if there's no devil. Why do people worship the devil? Good question.

Alex Jones  1:12:56
I know this is not the devil pulling my strings. Again, according to John Anderson, and I guess Paul Revere, the devil isn't even around anymore. Let me respect you.

John Anderson   1:13:09
That is according to Scripture, not according to John Anderson.

Alex Jones  1:13:12
Lon, what I'm trying to ask you here is this. Why does it world leaders go to the Bohemian Grove to worship the devil? Why does Arnold checkmate the devil?

John Anderson   1:13:23
Hey, let's talk about hope for five years of my life. I went through the nonsense. I came to the truth of the Lord Jesus Christ, January of 1979. You know, I've met people that think they've talked to a rock solid. They think they're channeling this that sonar so forth. People have a lot of strange ideas.

Dan  1:13:43
I found myself in a very bizarre position where I am laughing my ass off at Paul Revere believing that he's a citizen of the kingdom of heaven and the laws don't apply. But he and John Anderson make a lot more sense than Alex in this.

Jordan  1:13:59
I know. I know. I really do. I really do want to fight him. I really do want to throw rocks as well so people talk to him. I mean, those rock Hey, listen, listen. I've seen people do all kinds of weird shit. Like for instance, one time I got pulled over by a cop because of I believe in some weird stuff. I started talking

Dan  1:14:17
to him to be fair, this is John talking

Jordan  1:14:20
here anyways, but

Dan  1:14:21
the the the question, if the devil doesn't exist, why do people worship him? And the answer being people do a lot of weird shit is like well, I don't have a rebuttal to that I

Jordan  1:14:32
know is true. So but you do a lot of weird shit. God dammit. Right. There's that and

Dan  1:14:37
I'm I'm pretty sure that if I knew more about either Paul Revere or John Anderson. Yeah, I would not think that they come off as rational. No, no, no, of course. And obviously even just from this website, I don't think Paul's got a good head on his shoulders. But Alex cannot handle very basic things that John Anderson is throwing at him. Yeah, it's pretty not good. But John did bring up that he used to be involved in the occult. And this is going to be a good way for Alex to try and be like, maybe you are

Jordan  1:15:06
the devil. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, no, they can't bond over his previous being in the occult

Dan  1:15:12
truth, where maybe it was just like,

Jordan  1:15:15
Yeah, well, for continuity right now. No, no, no. Yeah.

Alex Jones  1:15:19
I didn't know that. What type of occult stuff were you into?

John Anderson   1:15:22
Oh, I was involved in basically pseudo satanic It was what is called a non blood cult. We believed in basically the adherence of the Golden Dawn, the Great White Brotherhood. What worked as a professional psychic, I'm the one that made the prediction to Larry Flynt bungalow number six. This would be an attempt on his life was 30 days. 23 days, he was shot in Lawrenceville, Georgia that made national headlines really how'd you do that?

Alex Jones  1:15:46
There aren't spirits and things out there. Call the Lucky

John Anderson   1:15:48
guess Alex.

Jordan  1:15:52
John? Damn. Damn. Alex, do you not understand that the point of this story is I no longer believe I was second. Alex, you realize the point of this story is that I am telling you I am not actually psychic. I do not have the powers of a psychic. I believe that back then.

Dan  1:16:14
Oh, how'd you do that without spirits? Well,

Jordan  1:16:15
I didn't do it. The thing I said I didn't. I wasn't a psychic.

Dan  1:16:21
So, again, that's delightful. And I think one of the reasons is the Alex who lies about his predictions in order to appear prophetic in some ways, right? I didn't look into this. So I don't know if John Anderson actually did make this prediction. But assuming that he did, he's disowning it as some kind of a like feat of his brilliance. As a lucky guess. Yeah, that kind of like, it's refreshing to enjoy juxtaposition to Alex. Although I'm sure John Anderson is a wild lunatic.

Jordan  1:16:55
Oh, yeah. No doubt. There. It is. It is fantastic.

Dan  1:17:00
Did you tell Larry Flynt, this what's going on here? Just predicted it.

Jordan  1:17:04
He just predicted it.

Dan  1:17:05
I don't know. I don't know what's happening.

Jordan  1:17:06
It does feel like maybe we're in different, like spots of the lie con about your your predictions. Like he's like, Ah, no, no, that was my old grift. Like, maybe Alex, we see him in 10 years on somebody else's show, like add on prediction anymore. I used to lie about you know, like, where are we in this? grift

Dan  1:17:26
this guy probably isn't saying that. It was a lie that it was some kind of a psychic prediction. Maybe it felt like it to him then. Sure. But he got lucky. Really? If you think Right, right? You I would see it that way. He's not disowning necessarily the fact that he did say this and it came true. Just that there's any meaning to it. Right.

Jordan  1:17:47
Right. Right. It's coincidence. Yeah.

Dan  1:17:49
Not a lie. No. Right.

Jordan  1:17:52
I mean, did it get paid for it? It made the national sell it there we go.

Dan  1:17:57
So look, there's another problem that Alex asked was that all right, fine. Is this all happened in the past? Why isn't the devil in a

Jordan  1:18:05
cage? That's a good question.

John Anderson   1:18:07
Satan was destroyed as he said he would do when He came. That's why he came that's through his death. He overcame the devil.

Alex Jones  1:18:17
Okay, where does the devil in a cage for 1000 years for people to look at him and say that's the

John Anderson   1:18:21
guy that did all this. Okay, first of all, you're going to Revelation 20. And you're taking the, quote, literalistic, 999 years plus one,

Alex Jones  1:18:30
you just did a literalistic thing to say it's all circular just circles. And so it isn't? No, it is both doing it. I'm not that's why

Dan  1:18:40
I can't do anything. It's almost like we're both walking in mud.

Jordan  1:18:45
It is a little bit like you guys are so close to stumbling on that you're arguing about imaginary nonsense. And it's very silly. But we just keep going back and forth. Because there's no way to settle this argument based upon made up nonsense from 1000s of years ago. Oh,

Dan  1:19:00
I would say I don't want to believe in either of these people's ideas. No, no, that said, forced to choose between the two and we grade on a curve because this is Alex. You know, we're listening to intro. Yeah. And so you know, Alex, you know, all the shit that he believes in? Well, so this person comes off looking pretty good. Just based on not being a wild liar.

Jordan  1:19:23
I'm liking his passports idea. say Well,

Dan  1:19:26
again, Paul. Yeah, John. Okay, that's fair. Ringo, also some way. All right. All right. So there's all things being equal. I'll take a world where there isn't a devil running around, as opposed to one where there is and so already John's idea in his world is far more appealing to me. Yeah. It seems bizarre to want to hold on to the idea that there is a devil. Yeah, but unless you need it. It

Jordan  1:19:55
does. It does seem like something he needs that he absolutely could never be able to process in like an understand it like he can't understand. No, I don't want the devil and it's like, no, you do, you do. But you can't process that. Like he just can't understand it

Dan  1:20:13
and you can't you just can't deal with the idea that the devil is dead.

John Anderson   1:20:18
And I want to back up just a second on this whole Satan issue. It's not what I'm saying. It's what the Scriptures teach us. The problem is many good God fearing Christians don't have a clue what the Bible says, okay? You're talking to one, Hebrews 214. Four as much then as the children are protectors of flesh and blood, he also Christ likewise took part of the same that through death, he might destroy him that had the power of death. That is the devil Did he fail or do to succeed?

Alex Jones  1:20:46
But you talk about looking at it? Did he fail or did it? Whoa, that's a nice lawyer tactic.

Jordan  1:20:58
is just an immigration hearing for the heaven country. What's happening right now? Objection. These that's before the courts of heaven, though. We've got years before the courts have haven't chosen.

Dan  1:21:10
Oh, yeah. I wonder if they're integrated. Those courts are part of the Embassy of have

Jordan  1:21:14
a right. Well, the courts have to notarize all of the documentation to get into heaven.

Dan  1:21:20
These are not notarized documents. There have to be a notary. Not public divine notary divine or some. Anyway, no, I

Jordan  1:21:31
know what you're searching for.

Dan  1:21:34
is great. Alex has no rebuttal to this. No, because it is okay. You know, Scripture tells us that Satan will be defeated by Jesus's sacrifice on the cross. Did he fail?

Jordan  1:21:45
Right? Right. Yeah. So that question he's, he's he's introduced the thing into a religious argument that you just can't do, which is a yes or no question. An up down question cannot happen in a religious argument,

Dan  1:21:58
especially one like that, where it's like, well, no matter what you answer, yeah, screwed. Yeah, maintain your position and answer that question.

Jordan  1:22:06
There's just no way. Fun. Yeah. The only way to answer that question is to not answer the question. Yeah.

Dan  1:22:13
Now, it's bizarre that I mean, like, at this point in his career, it's so weird that Alex just like, does this. Yeah. Like he doesn't hang up on them. He doesn't end the interview. He just gets kind of petty and child like, a little like, I don't know. Yeah, like lawyer trick or something. And I think that there is a desire that he has to be seen as strong in these settings right to his listeners. Sure. This looks very weak, right? He doesn't come off like somebody who can defend his position. Yeah,

Jordan  1:22:46
he reminds me I mean, this is fairly early on like this reminds me a little bit of those early debate bros on on like, the Twitch platforms or whatever the debate bros who would go in there with a freshman level philosophy audit to their name and like just try and argue with people about religion for a while and it didn't matter if they're obviously stupid arguments look stupid. They just clowned on that me or

Dan  1:23:14
or standups, who were like pretty early on wanting to tangle with hecklers or something, you know, like, man, there's a there's a desire to like, appear above or like having like, like, stood up to something

Jordan  1:23:30
median destroys heckler, but

Dan  1:23:33
there isn't like, in order to counter the things that this guy believes you need to first of all understand what he believes. And then second, you're gonna need to unpack this entire idea of heaven being the country. Yeah. And you don't want to do that? No, because it's way too complicated. Yeah, your audience is going to, you're going to lose some of them. And you're going to reveal that those are the sorts of people you're going to take seriously on your show. And that kind of, I don't know, demeans the entire show. Yeah. And I think he learns that if you're interviewing and taking seriously a guy who calls himself Paul Revere is the head of the Embassy of heaven and sells fraudulent documents to people like passports. Yeah, you kind of can't take yourself that seriously. And you would need to reveal that in order to actually have the conversation that Alex is wanting to have, right? And yeah, he's just stuck. And because of that, he just has John Anderson asking him these trap questions that he can't get out of,

Jordan  1:24:37
man. It's great. That's why That's why later on, he's like, I'm not doing that anymore. I assume. Yeah. I will hang up on you if you challenge me. So weirdly,

Dan  1:24:47
later on as the Tea Party grew, Paul Revere would come back up as somebody who worked for FEMA. Paul Revere worked for FEMA. He was a He was like a pastor that was recruited by FEMA in order to get them to preach Romans 13 Oh my god, everybody, which mysteriously isn't in his backstory here. Yeah. And I would have to assume, based on his lack of any documents is clearly fraud church. I don't think FEMA is going to be recruiting him into any kind of pastor and

Jordan  1:25:24
I'm interested to know about a conversation that happened, what meeting room did it happen where they're like, man, we cannot find anybody to preach the correct interpretation of Romans 13. And our FEMA camps, nobody will do

Dan  1:25:38
it. There's nobody that we can get to preach Romans 13 as a means of submitting to the FEMA camps, right. So we need Paul Revere, a guy who's made his entire career preaching the opposite of it and selling people fake passports. Yep.

Jordan  1:25:57
One passport if you want to enter by land, two passports if you want to enter by sea. Yeah, yeah. So we have one last

Dan  1:26:05
clip here. Okay. Alex doesn't get to the news.

Alex Jones  1:26:09
God let you get one. I'm sorry. I got loaded phones, no more time for calls. Again, this is a news program. And I just think it's very important to address this because the Romans 13 is clear. And I agree with our guests on that. That it's been twisted. And that's big news.

Dan  1:26:26
That is Big news. Big news. So we have all those stories that Alex didn't cover. Everyone wants him to talk about Arnold, he spends like over an hour talking with these dudes. Because the real big news apparently is that Romans 13 has been twisted.

Jordan  1:26:40
Yeah, what? Yeah, that is that is a curveball it

Dan  1:26:45
is. But there's one thing that's important to remember was that

Alex Jones  1:26:47
and again, whether you believe in Jesus Christ or not, this is not a religious show. I'm a Christian. I make no secret of that. But the point is, this affects you. This is not a

Jordan  1:26:57
religious show. This is not a religious show.

Dan  1:27:00
Now we're going to spend over an hour talking to a weirdo pastor who calls himself Paul Revere believes he's the head of the Embassy of heaven. Yeah. But it's not a religion. This

Jordan  1:27:11
is a show that touches on religious topics, okay, from time to time, and has transformed a mythology of the United States into its own smaller version of Christianity itself, thus making my belief in the country a religion, along with my belief in the state is a religion, along with my belief in this house being a really like he's a religious man.

Dan  1:27:37
Well, this this is not a religious show. Okay. All right. All right. We will spend over an hour discussing religious stuff in a desperate attempt for me to cling to my belief in the devil.

Jordan  1:27:49
Yeah. worth it. Worth it. And Dan, here's what you don't understand. What's this affects you?

Dan  1:27:57
It made me laugh. It affected me.

Jordan  1:28:00
It did affect you. In the literal definition of the word.

Dan  1:28:04
Yeah. And I think it was a nice reprieve as it were from present day bullshit.

Jordan  1:28:10
Yeah, this felt good.

Dan  1:28:11
Yeah, a little bit of can maybe that shoulders feeling a little looser now?

Jordan  1:28:16
It's a little bit better. I feel like I just got some icy hot on there just doing it. Right. Yeah. Therapeutic

Dan  1:28:20
effective shot.

Jordan  1:28:25
That sounds about right.

Dan  1:28:26
So if you are, you know, watching Alex's trial, and you're, you know, thinking that he's onto something, remember that his career is meaningless. Sort of bullshit that he does. You got it. Anyway. Jordan, we'll be back. Probably check back in on the present day on Monday, perhaps? Oh, yeah. We'll see. We'll see. But until then, we have website.

Jordan  1:28:50

Dan  1:28:52

Jordan  1:28:54
are on Twitter. It's at knowledge underscore fight.

Dan  1:28:56
Yep, we'll be back. But until then, I'm Neil. I'm Leo. I'm DCX Clark. I am Wilford snuggle Snapple of the Gribble. Pebble, and now here comes the sex robots.
