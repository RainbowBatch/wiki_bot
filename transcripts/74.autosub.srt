Most people can't afford to pay attention a little bit

13
00:00:51,712 --> 00:00:53,760
You just become aware of them and then

14
00:00:54,016 --> 00:00:55,040
You know you want me to

15
00:00:58,112 --> 00:00:59,136

From 2015

53
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:15,584
People then go back and listen to what we've said what we written what we have exposed

54
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:23,264
Understand that we do have our finger on the pulse

55
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:29,152
We do understand how the elite operate

56
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:31,968
Are sure would beg to differ

57
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:37,344
People will go back and listen to this

58
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,880
Two years later we're like yeah

59
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:41,184
And no no not at all

60
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:46,304
And no sir

61
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,864
Span of October 4th

62
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:49,632
Thirsty

63
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:51,424
4015

64
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:53,728
2015

65
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:55,008
Forever

66
00:03:55,264 --> 00:04:00,640
Publicly that we have an episode 2

67
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:07,040
Covering Alex Jones's further coverage of the events in Charlottesville

68
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:09,088
We recorded

69
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:11,904
The evening of Trumps

70
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:12,928
Latest Prescott

71
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:14,976
Almost simultaneously

72
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:17,536
Yeah and

73
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:20,095
The hearing is a press conference everything

74
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:22,399
That our analysis was good

75
00:04:22,911 --> 00:04:29,055
In terms of what we had in front of us and how Alex Jones is about a lot of stuff with

76
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:30,335
Add a contact of

77
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:32,127
Basically mirroring Alex

78
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:33,151
On so many fronts

79
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:34,687
It became a thing where

80
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:36,991
That's what we need to talk about

81
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:39,039
Episode itself would have been dogshit

82
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:42,111
So I don't like that's the reason for not putting it up

83
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:42,879
But

84
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:45,183
I've been having a lot of thoughts

85
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:46,207
I just want to say that

86
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:46,975
Really quick

87
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:48,255
I feel like

88
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:51,839
I kind of know what's going on here with these white nationalists

89
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:54,143
And I see

90
00:04:56,447 --> 00:05:02,079
What's going on are they looking for something I'm not saying that I know as much as even

91
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:04,383
Deep deep deep sleep study

92
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:06,687
I'm not saying that

93
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:08,479
Of what's going on and the direct

94
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:09,247
Some things are going

95
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:10,015
And it's bad

96
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:12,575
I predicted on the last episode

97
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:13,343
We were going to see

98
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:14,623
The Isis like insert

99
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:15,903
Please come together

100
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:17,695
I meant immediately there was that guy

101
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:20,767
In Oklahoma who got arrested with 1,000 lb

102
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:22,559
Federal Reserve building

103
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:28,703
Course

104
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:32,031
That's literally

105
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:35,615
Absolutely

106
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:37,407
You can't do that whole thing

107
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:39,199
I'm right where they are

108
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:44,575
That's for real for real war

109
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:49,695
Yeah and it's it's scary and I'm terrified and I hope that

110
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:51,231
My fears

111
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:52,767
And why expectation

112
00:05:53,279 --> 00:05:54,303
Predictions are off

113
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:56,351
I don't know we'll see

114
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:58,399
But I had one thought

115
00:05:58,655 --> 00:06:00,959
That I want to share with everybody and you Jordan

116
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:04,287
I know you were looking at me very accusatory

117
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:06,079
I think this is actually a good

118
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:08,127
And I think it's something that should

119
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:11,199
Good talk

120
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:14,015
This is a mega good and bad song

121
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:15,295
Is bittersweet

122
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:16,319
It's a bittersweet

123
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:18,623
There's a massive difference between

124
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:19,903
People on the left

125
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:22,719
Be alright then gone

126
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:23,743
White nationalist

127
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:24,767
What's the Nazis

128
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:27,071
The biggest difference

129
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:28,607
What's that I see beyond

130
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:30,399
Very obvious

131
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:33,471
Are the people on the left specially activist

132
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:35,007
Engage people

133
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:37,055
A place of love

134
00:06:37,567 --> 00:06:39,103
They operate from a place of love

135
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:41,151
And trust with each other and vulnerability

136
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:42,431
There is

137
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:44,991
A part of it that is

138
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:46,015
Usher

139
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:46,783
Goal

140
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:48,063
A shared objective

141
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:49,343
Videos Unity

142
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:50,111
And is

143
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:54,463
I get taken care of and so do you and so does everybody else

144
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:57,023
Damn there's a freedom to be what you are

145
00:06:57,535 --> 00:07:00,095
Gay people can just be gay trans people can be trained

146
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:02,143
And there's a vulnerability in living

147
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:03,423
Who you are public

148
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:06,751
And there's something that brings people together about that

149
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:08,031
And creates community

150
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:10,335
So when you see these organizations

151
00:07:10,847 --> 00:07:12,639
These hippie leftist organization

152
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:13,663
That protest

153
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:16,479
Often you'll see people who stand arms

154
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:17,247
2 arm

155
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:18,783
Together different

156
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:21,087
And they care about each other and that's great

157
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:22,623
On the right

158
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:23,903
It's beer

159
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:26,207
It's fear and paranoia

160
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:27,999
And that is not

161
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:28,767
Sustainable

162
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:32,095
You see what's happening even within the Trump White

163
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:33,887
Everyone's turning on each other

164
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:36,959
It's constantly happening because they

165
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:37,983
Come from this place

166
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:40,543
Of conspiratorial paranoia

167
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:44,383
This fear this fear of someone trying to squash them

168
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,175
It's on Meredith

169
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:48,991
It's this fear of whiteness being eradicated

170
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:52,063
Or whatever version you want to fill in that Gap

171
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:54,111
That beer

172
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:56,159
Makes you fear everyone else

173
00:07:56,671 --> 00:07:57,695
Even the people you're so

174
00:07:57,951 --> 00:07:58,975
Supposed to be in lockstep

175
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:00,511
So

176
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:04,863
Even though we see these disparate white nationalist groups coming together

177
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:06,911
And they're doing some damage

178
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:10,751
There is a part of me that knows full well

179
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:11,775
They're going to

180
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:14,591
To turn on each other cuz they're going to start taking each other or fed

181
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:17,407
They're going to come to a point where they're like

182
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:18,943
You're an infiltrator

183
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:19,711
There is

184
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:20,479
Cannibalistic

185
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:22,271
These sorts of organizations

186
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:23,295
Can't really

187
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:26,111
Make the sort of loving Coke

188
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:27,135
Lisa Vaughn

189
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:28,415
The people

190
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:29,695
Supporting each other

191
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:31,231
Ansel

192
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:32,767
That's my positive feeling

193
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,559
Right now unfortunately

194
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:41,983
About it is

195
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:44,799
That Wendy's conspiratorial paranoid

196
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:46,847
Type of Tendencies come out

197
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:48,127
It often leads

198
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:49,151
To explosion

199
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:50,175
So

200
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:51,455
There could be

201
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:52,991
Some really negative

202
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:53,759
Flare up

203
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:55,039
And what have you

204
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:56,831
But they'll never

205
00:08:57,599 --> 00:08:58,879
Will never be able to work

206
00:08:59,135 --> 00:08:59,647
Work together well

207
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:01,439
I'm at the plaza

208
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:02,463
I think

209
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:08,351
I don't know it's cold comfort and I don't think it's that great but it was something that dawned on me when I was

210
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:10,911
Going over some of these stories

211
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:11,679
And watching

212
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:12,447
Footage

213
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:13,727
From the

214
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:15,007
From the demonstrations

215
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:20,383
It's like it's terrifying but at the same time there's a there's a pitiable ass

216
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:21,663
When you see them interact with

217
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:24,223
With each other

218
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:25,503
I agree

219
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:32,927
Type beat right

220
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:36,255
It might be it might be something very small but

221
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:38,047
They that wait on the heart

222
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:39,071
Well

223
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:41,631
I agree with you like whatever

224
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:42,399
So I

225
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,239
Advice of Menifee

226
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:47,007
People who

227
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:49,055
Here's what we got to do

228
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:51,615
We should

229
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:52,895
We should talk to them

230
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:55,455
If you have somebody that you know who is

231
00:09:56,479 --> 00:10:00,319
Engaging with his alright bulshit unfortunately know where this is going

232
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:05,439
And

233
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:07,487
I got a lot of Infowars back

234
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:11,327
Did you forward me that email there's a

235
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:16,703
There's a good bit of it but it's not encouraging

236
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:21,055
But it is anymore

237
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:26,687
It's just ironic to

238
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:28,223
I've spent the last

239
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:30,015
Pretty much year of my life

240
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:32,831
Fighting against Alex Jones only to be

241
00:10:33,343 --> 00:10:34,111
Related to it

242
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:36,415
Whatever I'm talking to him

243
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:37,695
I don't want

244
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:39,487
I want him to

245
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:40,255
See what's wrong

246
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:42,047
I want him to

247
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:43,839
Because I believe he's a good person

248
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:47,679
This is not good

249
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:49,983
I know you think you're following through with your princess

250
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:51,775
But

251
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:52,799
Twisted by this

252
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:54,335
Nonsense

253
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:56,639
Just for a second remember you're not a

254
00:10:57,407 --> 00:11:01,759
Or not the apologist

255
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:03,295
Them and they just can't do that

256
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:08,415
Seaside is all Jews should die

257
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:11,487
So I'm going to go with we're fighting out of love

258
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:14,559
If you're apologizing

259
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:17,375
Apologize

260
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:18,399
For Nazis

261
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:23,007
To be in the middle if you're apologizing for

262
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:24,799
No no

263
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:27,615
The part that you know

264
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:31,455
A lot of people have made this point already but

265
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:33,247
The weekend you can cast

266
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:35,295
Decide very easily the argument that

267
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:37,087
There are good people who are

268
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:39,135
Just with them

269
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:42,719
Yeah no arguments

270
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:45,023
I've been to 100 protests in my license

271
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:47,327
Anytime there were Nazis

272
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:48,351
Airplane people

273
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:52,447
Open like I'm getting the f*** out of here

274
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:54,239
If you're surrounded by

275
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:55,263
Maybe you're not

276
00:11:55,519 --> 00:12:01,663
Terrible right one of the two

277
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:06,271
Cuz even if you do care about Southern Heritage so much that you feel like you got to go to the protest

278
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:10,367
The only two options are leave or then demonstrate against

279
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:12,159
The Nazis being a part of your protest

280
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:13,951
Those are really the only

281
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:15,999
To socially active

282
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:17,279
Responsible

283
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:18,559
Things you can do

284
00:12:18,815 --> 00:12:19,583
But be that as it may

285
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:21,631
Let's not dwell on this too far cuz

286
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:24,703
The simplest way of putting it

287
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:25,471
Is

288
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:26,751
Not everybody who voted

289
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:30,591
Now they are

290
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:32,895
Now it's time to

291
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:36,479
Look in the goddamn mirror the one who's on the side of

292
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:38,527
Good luck

293
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:39,807
Good f****** lakay

294
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:46,463
I don't want to talk about this anymore and

295
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:47,999
Proventil

296
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:50,303
Which I don't see happening cuz you now on vacation

297
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:53,631
We were safe to go back to the past

298
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:55,679
I go back to 2015

299
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:59,007
Be going over the 4th to the 6th

300
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:00,799
Guess what

301
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:07,199
On 4th David Knight hosted we don't have to talk about that s*** at all I'm looking forward to all the stuff

302
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:07,967
Not talkin about

303
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:11,551
That's my favorite part of the show right now

304
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:17,439
Not talking about it that's another one of the win column for us

305
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:18,463
Big old weigh

306
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:23,327
Here's how Alex Jones Watson start

307
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:24,863
This is the beginning narrative

308
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:25,631
The kickoff

309
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:29,471
I also in the fourth hour Paul Joseph Watson

310
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:30,751
This morning

311
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:39,711
And

312
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:47,391
This motherfukers wearing my dress

313
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:51,999
Endorsement

314
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:53,791
It's hurtful.

315
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:55,583
You may have to lose your eyesight

316
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:04,543
Your existence

317
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:08,127
So you don't know where that

318
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:09,151
But that's based on

319
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:19,135
I can't be happier that were in 2015 Dance For Us in 2015

320
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:21,439
Arise

321
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:23,999
Best trendy

322
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:28,095
May we live here in perpetuity

323
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:30,911
Alex Jones saw some sort of

324
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:32,447
I don't know probably

325
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:35,007
He's ready he's ready

326
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:35,775
Vonnegut

327
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:38,079
Like one time

328
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:39,359
And that's all he knows

329
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:40,895
So that's all he's doing right now

330
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:43,455
But this is

331
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:44,991
Aji sauce

332
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:49,087
Some British version of a show that's like My Strange Addiction

333
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:53,183
I like that one of these shows where they follow people

334
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:54,975
Pretty bizarre

335
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:58,559
Cuz even plays part of it on the show and everybody loves a freak

336
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:04,959
It is there worshiping these people pouring Drano in their eyes

337
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:11,615
They're showing that there are people who believe that they should be blind

338
00:15:13,407 --> 00:15:16,991
There are people who believe they should

339
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:18,271
And cut off their arm

340
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:25,183
Supporting anybody

341
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:25,951
I don't know

342
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:28,255
If you want to if there's an argument

343
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:32,863
So small of a population because I'm not sure I need to have an opinion

344
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:34,399
But I don't want to

345
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:38,239
Stop the Elsa want to say that

346
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:44,639
Trendy's are not worshiping them

347
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:45,407
That because that's

348
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:48,223
That's the same thing as

349
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:48,991
GB like

350
00:15:49,247 --> 00:15:55,391
That's going to a carnival and having the guys they look at the bearded lady especially the ones that are like I eat my bed

351
00:15:55,647 --> 00:15:58,463
There's a conversation about that

352
00:15:58,719 --> 00:16:01,023
What is the copycat is not becoming

353
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:08,703
Like a carnival Sideshow s***

354
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:11,775
No I'm not super thrilled with that but

355
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:17,663
Then again about sucking 33 year-old man I shouldn't be

356
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:20,735
90s local Broadcast News

357
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:25,343
You're in your eyes could that be happening to your kids

358
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:31,487
If if the local news guy was really obsessed with globalists into trendys yet

359
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:34,815
So Alex

360
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:39,167
It's going to be 1000 degrees by the end of the

361
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:40,959
The week because they're globalism

362
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:47,359
Thanks 16 will be everybody's

363
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:51,455
The trendy

364
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:55,295
Worship blind making people blind do I have you

365
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:56,831
These on that for like days

366
00:16:57,087 --> 00:16:58,623
It's ridiculous

367
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:01,439
Give other stuff

368
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:03,743
The other other narratives he wants to get to

369
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:05,535
This one's kind of interesting

370
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:11,679
Alex Jones shows

371
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:14,751
Alex is way ahead of the curve my man

372
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:19,871
This is about 20 years ago about linguistic

373
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:20,639
Okay

374
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:22,943
And European is wrong

375
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:24,991
Members of the

376
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:28,319
UK and German and French government the last month

377
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:30,879
On television articles

378
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:36,767
Because it's Europe has white people

379
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:39,071
And it's good they're all about to be gone

380
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:42,143
Northbrook

381
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:51,103
So you are

382
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:01,599
I said you mean where

383
00:18:02,367 --> 00:18:07,231
A woman

384
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:23,359
I love that played

385
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:26,943
Eva

386
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:27,711
Eerily

387
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:28,991
Specifically

388
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:31,039
You might as well as that black dude

389
00:18:32,575 --> 00:18:33,599
He was actually saying

390
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:38,207
Do you mean that video you sent me right right

391
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:40,511
I agree I look up

392
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:41,791
We wrote the story a little bit

393
00:18:42,047 --> 00:18:44,863
In terms of like Shakespearean language

394
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:51,263
Adjustment a lady who is cheating on her husband and everyone knew it modern

395
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:55,359
Pornography

396
00:18:55,615 --> 00:19:01,759
Exactly what is 15

397
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:09,183
Fruit that is great until like the crnkovich is come along and stuff like

398
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:09,951
But

399
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:12,511
He's right there

400
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:15,327
I think it might be right around the corner

401
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:16,863
I think they might show up around the

402
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:20,703
Who's Rodger Stone

403
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:24,287
They're all their ears perk up

404
00:19:30,431 --> 00:19:34,271
So I'm pretty thrilled to that I didn't know that Alex Jones is on the cock tip

405
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:35,039
Literally

406
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:36,319
I'm excited

407
00:19:41,183 --> 00:19:42,975
You're not going to like this next clip

408
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:45,279
Cuz it's one of the three times

409
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:47,839
Eight-and-a-half months

410
00:19:48,095 --> 00:19:49,631
That I've labeled a clip

411
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:50,399
Wolf

412
00:19:52,703 --> 00:19:53,983
So get ready for that

413
00:19:55,007 --> 00:19:56,543
Let's baby exasperated

414
00:19:57,055 --> 00:19:58,335
Can you be homosexual

415
00:19:58,847 --> 00:20:04,991
Already out

416
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:07,295
There are cases of it

417
00:20:09,855 --> 00:20:13,183
Drugs the

418
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:17,535
The degeneracy the mutilation is

419
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:25,215
The idea that will Embrace us

420
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:33,407
Didn't like the

421
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:38,783
Like the Greeks will this is just repetition of what that homophobic

422
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:41,599
Pastor said on the show like 3 weeks ago or whatever

423
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:44,671
Chronology

424
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:45,695
2015

425
00:20:45,951 --> 00:20:49,023
This is just an example of literally repeat

426
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:50,559
So

427
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:52,607
But that that's part of the Wolf

428
00:20:52,863 --> 00:20:53,375
Vet like

429
00:20:53,631 --> 00:20:54,911
I knew that you were

430
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:59,007
I knew that your answer was going to be what he deflected from immediately after

431
00:20:59,263 --> 00:21:01,823
We just got a nice it's a little frustrating but it gets so much worse

432
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:11,807
I'm civilization because the globalist are developing high-tech reservations

433
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:14,111
Cultural degradation

434
00:21:15,903 --> 00:21:17,184
The globalist

435
00:21:18,464 --> 00:21:21,536
Elysium basis

436
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:24,096
Seminar on artificial Islands

437
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:28,448
You don't get onto those things when you buy into any of the stuff

438
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:34,080
Is a cultural poison put out there to neutralize

439
00:21:43,296 --> 00:21:44,064
Well

440
00:21:44,832 --> 00:21:47,648
Do you sing

441
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:59,168
The first weapon

442
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:03,776
Cover for a whole bunch of different

443
00:22:10,176 --> 00:22:11,200
Racially-based

444
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:14,272
Caucasians

445
00:22:14,528 --> 00:22:15,040
Wait

446
00:22:15,808 --> 00:22:20,928
Are so closely aligned to Africans

447
00:22:24,256 --> 00:22:24,768
What

448
00:22:25,024 --> 00:22:27,840
You can sneeze we got HIV black person it

449
00:22:32,448 --> 00:22:37,312
What about the year relationship

450
00:22:37,568 --> 00:22:40,384
Let's talk about reality

451
00:22:43,968 --> 00:22:44,480
That's a

452
00:22:45,248 --> 00:22:48,832
That's a misunderstanding of all the things all the way at

453
00:22:49,088 --> 00:22:49,600
Simultaneous

454
00:22:51,392 --> 00:22:53,696
Also also even his argument of like

455
00:22:54,464 --> 00:22:58,560
Gay people destroy civilization if you embrace them

456
00:22:58,816 --> 00:23:01,376
That's why the globalist have no gay Utopia

457
00:23:01,888 --> 00:23:04,704
Right I guess three of the cultural degradation

458
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:08,032
Yeah he argues the globalist

459
00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:10,336
Superhero

460
00:23:10,592 --> 00:23:15,456
He also argued that globalist like f****** each other

461
00:23:17,248 --> 00:23:18,272
How do you not know that

462
00:23:18,528 --> 00:23:20,576
Fine

463
00:23:24,672 --> 00:23:26,464
Can have a conversation about that

464
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:29,280
Jon rappoport

465
00:23:29,536 --> 00:23:30,304
That's why

466
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:34,912
Reagan crack into the black community I will not put

467
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:37,984
Whatever whatever

468
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,264
But oh boy

469
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,128
If I understand this correctly

470
00:23:46,432 --> 00:23:48,224
White people are resistant

471
00:23:48,736 --> 00:23:49,504
Hib

472
00:23:50,784 --> 00:23:51,296
But

473
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:58,976
Designed specifically just

474
00:23:59,232 --> 00:23:59,744
For Africa

475
00:24:00,256 --> 00:24:01,792
Understand DNA

476
00:24:02,048 --> 00:24:06,144
He does not even come close to it

477
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,448
The studies that have been done have shown that there is a

478
00:24:08,704 --> 00:24:10,240
Incredibly higher-risk

479
00:24:10,496 --> 00:24:12,544
In Black communities of HIV

480
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:18,944
But the reason is generally it's because of poor resources in communities

481
00:24:20,224 --> 00:24:21,760
The systematic differences of

482
00:24:22,016 --> 00:24:23,808
Shittier education

483
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:24,832
Because we

484
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:26,624
Deflective Public School Systems

485
00:24:27,136 --> 00:24:27,648
Deteriorate

486
00:24:27,904 --> 00:24:29,440
And just access to healthcare

487
00:24:29,696 --> 00:24:33,024
Those are the things that are the main drivers of the wrist

488
00:24:33,536 --> 00:24:35,328
And intravenous drug use

489
00:24:35,584 --> 00:24:36,864
Things like that also

490
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,400
Artifacts are in it

491
00:24:38,656 --> 00:24:40,960
Hit his

492
00:24:41,216 --> 00:24:42,496
You get why I marked that

493
00:24:43,008 --> 00:24:43,776
That's a big oof

494
00:24:44,032 --> 00:24:46,336
Wow Let's talk about reality

495
00:24:48,384 --> 00:24:48,896
Great

496
00:24:49,152 --> 00:24:52,992
That's such a great punchline to that

497
00:24:55,808 --> 00:24:56,832
But really

498
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:01,440
Yeah really what he said so he said

499
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:04,768
You can sneeze on a black person and give them HIV

500
00:25:08,608 --> 00:25:10,656
Damasio book

501
00:25:10,912 --> 00:25:14,752
A hell of a sneaky

502
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,544
If you got

503
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,080
TV

504
00:25:19,104 --> 00:25:20,896
Just jumping on somebody

505
00:25:21,408 --> 00:25:21,920
Into their face

506
00:25:22,176 --> 00:25:23,968
Maybe maybe

507
00:25:24,224 --> 00:25:26,784
Are 28 Days Later

508
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:29,600
I think he thinks it is

509
00:25:32,928 --> 00:25:34,464
Alex's

510
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,256
Redeemable

511
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:37,280
Sneeze on the black

512
00:25:40,608 --> 00:25:43,936
Immaculate Palace Moline the homosexual community

513
00:25:46,496 --> 00:25:48,288
Sort of I don't know people on black

514
00:25:48,544 --> 00:25:51,104
People but he certainly

515
00:25:56,224 --> 00:25:57,248
Genetically

516
00:25:58,528 --> 00:26:02,368
That's fair I think that's fair but what you need to know is what Alex doesn't it

517
00:26:05,952 --> 00:26:08,000
Around most cases

518
00:26:08,256 --> 00:26:10,816
With with with the group above the Ku Klux Klan

519
00:26:11,328 --> 00:26:14,144
Ku Klux Klan is in their dialectic

520
00:26:15,168 --> 00:26:17,216
Used to just create

521
00:26:25,664 --> 00:26:26,176
PetSmart

522
00:26:26,432 --> 00:26:28,224
But they recall my mobile

523
00:26:35,648 --> 00:26:38,464
Going to give you free stuff

00:27:08,416 --> 00:27:09,952
Show me on the doll where Al Sharpton

525
00:27:10,208 --> 00:27:16,352
Unless you

526
00:27:16,608 --> 00:27:18,912
And that means every race every color every crate

527
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:27,104
Good

528
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:33,504
Pay for abortions

529
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:35,040
Alicia

530
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:39,136
Maryland

531
00:27:39,392 --> 00:27:40,160
Holler at you are

Cultural

534
00:27:46,304 --> 00:27:47,584
Notice how they're saying

535
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:51,680
Facebook at 50 different sexual preferences

536
00:27:52,448 --> 00:27:55,776
And the future you will be asexual

537
00:27:56,032 --> 00:27:57,056
Wrong creatures

538
00:27:57,824 --> 00:28:02,688
Under the UN plan it is not all that matters.

539
00:28:07,296 --> 00:28:12,160
Um puts out a plan where they're like we're going to make people asexual dronebot

540
00:28:15,744 --> 00:28:16,768
Totally

541
00:28:17,024 --> 00:28:20,352
This is pretty

542
00:28:21,376 --> 00:28:23,680
Eat ya in the

543
00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:25,984
21

544
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:27,008
The

545
00:28:27,776 --> 00:28:28,800
Plan of the globalist

546
00:28:29,056 --> 00:28:29,568
There is

547
00:28:29,824 --> 00:28:30,592
Really convolute

548
00:28:31,104 --> 00:28:33,152
Very much so

549
00:28:33,408 --> 00:28:35,712
Workout

550
00:28:35,968 --> 00:28:39,296
And if the global if they're the ones who really hate black

551
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:41,856
There

552
00:28:42,112 --> 00:28:43,136
They're just doing a bad job

553
00:28:43,648 --> 00:28:44,160
How so

554
00:28:45,184 --> 00:28:45,696
Well

555
00:28:45,952 --> 00:28:48,256
I mean if you really hated black people

556
00:28:48,512 --> 00:28:50,048
Any better plans as opposed to

557
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:52,608
Building up the KKK as a

558
00:28:52,864 --> 00:28:55,168
False flag for white people

559
00:28:55,424 --> 00:28:57,728
People also black people to hate white people

560
00:28:57,984 --> 00:29:04,128
Power up the black lives matter

561
00:29:04,384 --> 00:29:08,224
You forgot a piece of the plane

562
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,528
Director

563
00:29:10,784 --> 00:29:16,928
And then they train people to get mad

564
00:29:18,976 --> 00:29:19,488
Red

565
00:29:19,744 --> 00:29:20,768
Is the late nights

566
00:29:21,024 --> 00:29:21,792
70

567
00:29:22,048 --> 00:29:23,072
He wasn't an MC

568
00:29:25,376 --> 00:29:27,424
You drive around in a big ass convertible

569
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:30,752
He would

570
00:29:31,008 --> 00:29:33,056
F****** Spin and it would be an amazing

571
00:29:33,312 --> 00:29:35,872
Departament galten came over

572
00:29:38,432 --> 00:29:40,736
If you got to do a different

573
00:29:41,248 --> 00:29:42,272
Some Arch globalist

574
00:29:42,528 --> 00:29:43,040
Tricked him

575
00:29:43,552 --> 00:29:46,368
Well because

576
00:29:46,624 --> 00:29:47,904
Rap is an amazing art form

577
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:50,464
So Gore Vidal

578
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:51,744
Unfortunately

579
00:29:52,512 --> 00:29:54,560
Let the men dressing differ

580
00:29:57,376 --> 00:29:58,144
The point there

581
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,424
Is that Alex loves everybody

582
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:05,824
He wants to get across wow invalidating the

583
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,616
Entire point

584
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,688
Those of us who love

585
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:14,528
What a dick

586
00:30:14,784 --> 00:30:17,600
What a dick

587
00:30:19,392 --> 00:30:21,440
Oh you're just saying all the things you hate about black people

588
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:29,632
What makes you uncomfortable that black people is all the globalist

589
00:30:30,656 --> 00:30:36,800
It's a really sneaky way to be a bigot

590
00:30:37,312 --> 00:30:38,848
It's not that I hate

591
00:30:39,872 --> 00:30:41,408
I just hate all the things

592
00:30:42,688 --> 00:30:44,224
But it said the globalist make him do that

593
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:46,784
A little bit

594
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:53,440
On this show also Alex explained that people are Pepsi is using baby parts

595
00:30:53,696 --> 00:30:55,744
Flavor their sodas

596
00:30:56,256 --> 00:30:57,280
This is not true at all

597
00:30:59,328 --> 00:31:02,400
He screams about that a little bit it wasn't a big enough deal in 2050

598
00:31:02,912 --> 00:31:03,424
Get sued by Pepsi

599
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:04,704
No no no no

600
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:08,032
What there's no statue

601
00:31:08,544 --> 00:31:10,592
Limitations on that well know there's enough

602
00:31:10,848 --> 00:31:16,992
Truth to what he's talkin about that he probably couldn't get sued although it's a wild misrepresentation

603
00:31:17,248 --> 00:31:18,784
What's going on

604
00:31:19,296 --> 00:31:23,136
There isn't like a development a flavor development company that

605
00:31:23,392 --> 00:31:24,928
Has subcontracted with

606
00:31:25,184 --> 00:31:26,208
Pepsi in the past

607
00:31:26,976 --> 00:31:28,256
They use

608
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:29,280
Cloned

609
00:31:29,536 --> 00:31:31,584
Endometrial kidney cells

610
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:32,608
Or something like that

611
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:34,144
From elective abortion

612
00:31:34,656 --> 00:31:35,936
In some of their res

613
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:37,472
So

614
00:31:37,728 --> 00:31:39,776
There's removed from

615
00:31:40,288 --> 00:31:40,800
Actual cannibal

616
00:31:41,056 --> 00:31:44,128
But there is enough truth in it that I think Alex

617
00:31:44,384 --> 00:31:45,152
Could get away with not getting

618
00:31:45,408 --> 00:31:47,456
But he's straight up line

619
00:31:47,712 --> 00:31:51,552
Cuz he wants his audience to think when you drink Pepsi there's f****** babies in there

620
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:54,880
So

621
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:57,952
You know what

622
00:31:58,720 --> 00:31:59,744
He has a lot of Truth

623
00:32:00,256 --> 00:32:04,096
Despite what we say for hours on end

624
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:10,752
He's got a lot of Truth backing him up but he has a problem

625
00:32:11,008 --> 00:32:13,056
And that be that might be that he is too much

626
00:32:13,568 --> 00:32:14,080
Behind them

627
00:32:14,336 --> 00:32:17,408
Fantastic

628
00:32:17,664 --> 00:32:21,248
I found out one of the biggest reasons why under such government scrutiny right now

629
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:24,576
Is because of whistleblowers documents things like that

630
00:32:25,088 --> 00:32:28,928
I've got to the point where I can't even respond because

631
00:32:36,864 --> 00:32:37,888
They will arrest

632
00:32:39,424 --> 00:32:41,216
And you're afraid of no

633
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:48,384
Plumlee folks in Benghazi and all that and Colonel Shaffer

634
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:51,712
I don't even want to know

635
00:32:56,576 --> 00:33:02,720
Horse anymore

636
00:33:13,216 --> 00:33:16,032
Bro

637
00:33:16,544 --> 00:33:19,616
Will control the whole future that's why they're so brutal

638
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:21,664
Not backing down

639
00:33:22,688 --> 00:33:26,528
Whether you're FBI or CIA or

640
00:33:26,784 --> 00:33:28,064
Politician or an arrogant

641
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,600
NFL football player

642
00:33:29,856 --> 00:33:35,232
False reality

643
00:33:35,744 --> 00:33:38,304
Slow poison

644
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:41,888
The Shield we respond to see if we notice is a titrate the dose

645
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:48,032
Talk to guard what is it in different compounds all known

646
00:33:48,544 --> 00:33:53,408
Prostate function he'll never fails

647
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:55,456
20% off

648
00:33:55,712 --> 00:34:01,856
I've been listening to Alex Alex Jones everyday for a month

649
00:34:02,112 --> 00:34:03,648
Whiplash

650
00:34:03,904 --> 00:34:04,928
I was impressed

651
00:34:05,184 --> 00:34:10,304
Also

652
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:14,400
Brookside with the NFL football player

653
00:34:14,656 --> 00:34:16,960
It's not I don't think so cuz I don't think it was

654
00:34:17,216 --> 00:34:19,520
2015 Midview started his

655
00:34:19,776 --> 00:34:20,800
Is the public

656
00:34:21,056 --> 00:34:21,568
Protester

657
00:34:22,336 --> 00:34:23,872
He might have still been an activist but

658
00:34:24,128 --> 00:34:27,200
Daikumedia paying attention to what I don't think was in 2015

659
00:34:29,504 --> 00:34:31,808
If you're saying an NFL football if you're staying in

660
00:34:32,064 --> 00:34:33,856
Arrogant NFL football player

661
00:34:34,112 --> 00:34:34,880
That is

662
00:34:35,136 --> 00:34:36,160
Quote

663
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:39,232
Book Subway

664
00:34:39,488 --> 00:34:41,792
Apparently racist

665
00:34:42,816 --> 00:34:48,960
Very race I don't I don't know what was going on exactly that point but he always talked about how much he hates the NFL

666
00:34:49,216 --> 00:34:49,728
Because it's such a

667
00:34:49,984 --> 00:34:51,008
Distraction from globalist

668
00:34:51,264 --> 00:34:52,032
Some stuff like that

669
00:34:52,288 --> 00:34:57,664
But I'm willing to believe that that was a vague non-specific thing I don't know I'm not entirely sure

670
00:34:58,944 --> 00:34:59,456
Still racist

671
00:34:59,968 --> 00:35:01,504
But boy is that amazing

672
00:35:02,784 --> 00:35:03,552
First of all

673
00:35:03,808 --> 00:35:07,136
He is too many

674
00:35:13,792 --> 00:35:15,072
All these whistleblowers

675
00:35:15,328 --> 00:35:17,120
Giving me all of the same information

676
00:35:17,632 --> 00:35:19,168
Yeah it was a coup

677
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:21,216
Yes it was a false flag

678
00:35:21,728 --> 00:35:23,008
I don't need proof

679
00:35:23,264 --> 00:35:25,312
Purple Penguin

680
00:35:26,848 --> 00:35:28,128
I don't want any

681
00:35:28,896 --> 00:35:29,408
In the degrees of May

682
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:33,248
Frost guard

683
00:35:33,504 --> 00:35:34,272
That's pretty amazing

684
00:35:35,552 --> 00:35:37,088
You got a lot of s*** coming out of you

685
00:35:38,112 --> 00:35:38,880
Because got to poop

686
00:35:41,184 --> 00:35:41,696
So

687
00:35:42,208 --> 00:35:45,024
Yeah I have anymore

688
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:46,304
Reservoirs coming up to him

689
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:49,888
I want I want this clip

690
00:35:51,936 --> 00:35:54,752
Okay good but it just it's delightful

691
00:35:55,264 --> 00:35:57,312
Cuz you eat in this nightclub

692
00:35:57,568 --> 00:35:59,104
A the Liberals

693
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:00,640
And the Dum Dums like us

694
00:36:00,896 --> 00:36:02,432
Fallen for the globalist

695
00:36:02,944 --> 00:36:04,992
To a certain other group dum dum

696
00:36:05,504 --> 00:36:07,552
And it's it's pretty fun

697
00:36:07,808 --> 00:36:09,856
Let's find out it's a total false reality

698
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:12,416
People don't know what they're talking about

699
00:36:16,512 --> 00:36:18,816
Repeat

700
00:36:19,072 --> 00:36:20,352
Because they have nothing

701
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:26,240
They're totally in the hands of a

702
00:36:31,104 --> 00:36:32,384
I can't tell you how many people

703
00:36:32,896 --> 00:36:39,040
I'm coming over the years with Nigerian scams and other skins

704
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:45,696
OU falling for one of those scams

705
00:36:49,792 --> 00:36:51,840
MMA even invest in the fraud

706
00:36:53,632 --> 00:36:58,240
And then down the road will never speak to me again

707
00:37:04,128 --> 00:37:06,176
Because they can't admit they got screwed over

708
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:07,456
I didn't learn from it

709
00:37:09,504 --> 00:37:12,064
Successful

710
00:37:18,976 --> 00:37:22,560
It's their family as their clubs are cool nobody can stop them

711
00:37:22,816 --> 00:37:26,400
There

712
00:37:26,656 --> 00:37:28,192
2 Chainz

713
00:37:28,448 --> 00:37:34,592
A couple of important first

714
00:37:35,104 --> 00:37:40,224
Buck is he doesn't talk about it all the time but the fourth time you talked about the Nigerians

715
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:47,648
Prince bububu Austin bar

716
00:37:48,672 --> 00:37:52,512
I don't know if that's the next stage of the scam I think it's a one stage

717
00:37:53,536 --> 00:37:54,048
Second

718
00:37:54,816 --> 00:37:55,840
Let's take it easy line

719
00:37:56,096 --> 00:37:57,120
But let's pretend he's not

720
00:37:57,632 --> 00:38:00,960
But he knows for people who fell for the

721
00:38:01,216 --> 00:38:01,728
Yeah

722
00:38:02,496 --> 00:38:03,008
Tumor

723
00:38:03,264 --> 00:38:04,288
Your Friends Are

724
00:38:05,312 --> 00:38:08,384
He knows more those are just the ones who won't talk to him

725
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:09,408
Anymore

726
00:38:09,664 --> 00:38:13,248
A lot of people

727
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:19,648
What you don't know is that he's not on air is volunteering at a very tech-savvy nursing

728
00:38:21,952 --> 00:38:24,768
It is a place where really old people

729
00:38:25,024 --> 00:38:28,096
Exposed to the internet and email

730
00:38:28,608 --> 00:38:29,888
To not answer email

731
00:38:30,144 --> 00:38:30,912
Wow

732
00:38:31,424 --> 00:38:32,960
That's that my only Theory

733
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:37,824
To want is Alex's lying to

734
00:38:40,128 --> 00:38:40,640
Buckley

735
00:38:40,896 --> 00:38:42,176
Buckley it still talking

736
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:49,344
Buckley second third and fourth ex-wife

737
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:55,744
Destroying Buckley marriage

738
00:38:56,512 --> 00:38:57,280
I'm so

739
00:38:57,536 --> 00:38:58,816
This whole investigation

740
00:38:59,072 --> 00:39:00,096
Isabel

741
00:39:00,352 --> 00:39:01,632
Figure out where Alex Jones

742
00:39:01,888 --> 00:39:04,704
About the 2016 presidential election

743
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:05,984
Right

744
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:08,032
We get to check in

745
00:39:08,288 --> 00:39:10,336
Who who who

746
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:11,616
You're in the truck yet

747
00:39:12,384 --> 00:39:12,896
Cuz

748
00:39:13,152 --> 00:39:14,688
He hasn't been up to this point

749
00:39:14,944 --> 00:39:17,504
Let's see where's had that on

750
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:20,320
I would support Trump more if he

751
00:39:20,832 --> 00:39:23,392
Paul and I really like Carson

752
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:28,000
I can tell he's really a good man

753
00:39:28,512 --> 00:39:29,536
He's so good

754
00:39:29,792 --> 00:39:34,656
Inoculations

755
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:37,984
He's super smart

756
00:39:38,496 --> 00:39:41,568
But he's I know people like this so good

757
00:39:41,824 --> 00:39:43,616
He wants to help people so much

758
00:39:44,128 --> 00:39:46,688
Then he just can't believe the system crap they're bad

759
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:47,712
And

760
00:39:48,992 --> 00:39:53,344
I don't want us there really smart loving hardworking people on average

761
00:39:53,856 --> 00:39:56,160
The most successful people I know are Seventh-day Adventist

762
00:39:56,672 --> 00:39:59,744
But they still will do what

763
00:40:00,256 --> 00:40:04,352
You know a lot of Seventh-day Adventist

764
00:40:04,608 --> 00:40:05,888
We tested on

765
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,680
They volunteered for

766
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:11,008
Including some cases to be killed

767
00:40:11,264 --> 00:40:11,776
Basically

768
00:40:13,312 --> 00:40:15,616
Because I thought that was christ-like I mean

769
00:40:17,408 --> 00:40:18,944
My mom Workforce

770
00:40:21,248 --> 00:40:22,528
Dallas

771
00:40:26,112 --> 00:40:27,136
Point

772
00:40:27,392 --> 00:40:29,952
Nashville TV show

773
00:40:30,464 --> 00:40:36,608
Steven Trump

774
00:40:45,056 --> 00:40:46,080
It's just that

775
00:40:54,784 --> 00:40:56,064
Tearing

776
00:40:56,832 --> 00:40:59,392
Values

777
00:40:59,648 --> 00:41:04,000
The other way if you then just start saying the state's perfect

778
00:41:05,536 --> 00:41:09,632
He said

779
00:41:11,936 --> 00:41:12,704
Carson

780
00:41:16,544 --> 00:41:20,128
I really do like Cruz, he's got some better leadership qualities

781
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:23,200
I like trains

782
00:41:23,968 --> 00:41:25,504
I guess you were asking callers

783
00:41:26,016 --> 00:41:29,088
What

784
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:32,672
A lot more

785
00:41:36,512 --> 00:41:37,536
Who was somebody like

786
00:41:38,816 --> 00:41:42,144
Does not include

787
00:41:45,216 --> 00:41:46,240
That's where he's at

788
00:41:46,496 --> 00:41:52,640
Long diatribe about Seventh-day Adventist I don't know why

789
00:41:58,783 --> 00:42:00,831
Text job history

790
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:02,367
His mom works

791
00:42:02,623 --> 00:42:04,159
Pr4 The Seventh-Day Advent

792
00:42:05,183 --> 00:42:06,207
But wasn't

793
00:42:06,463 --> 00:42:11,327
I don't understand I don't care to unpack it like once we already have been placed the CIA dentist

794
00:42:11,583 --> 00:42:12,351
Story

795
00:42:12,607 --> 00:42:15,423
Add 26 smartest boy in Austin, Texas

796
00:42:15,935 --> 00:42:16,959
Country who knows

797
00:42:17,215 --> 00:42:19,007
Who cares

798
00:42:19,263 --> 00:42:21,567
It's all made up

799
00:42:22,335 --> 00:42:28,479
We talked about

800
00:42:30,015 --> 00:42:32,319
We can't nail down these

801
00:42:32,575 --> 00:42:36,671
Because he always talks about like all my family is in the

802
00:42:37,439 --> 00:42:41,535
Your CIA dentist dad also

803
00:42:42,303 --> 00:42:45,887
He assigns whatever job he needs to one of his family members

804
00:42:46,143 --> 00:42:47,935
In order to make some sort of connect

805
00:42:48,191 --> 00:42:49,215
Listen to what he's talking about

806
00:42:49,471 --> 00:42:50,495
I don't believe

807
00:42:50,751 --> 00:42:51,263
Three quarters

808
00:42:53,311 --> 00:42:56,127
The Avengers part I believe 100%

809
00:42:57,151 --> 00:42:59,711
I love it I love that Ben Carson

810
00:42:59,967 --> 00:43:00,479
Is a

811
00:43:00,735 --> 00:43:01,503
Good man

812
00:43:01,759 --> 00:43:02,271
He's a

813
00:43:02,527 --> 00:43:03,295
Find man

814
00:43:03,807 --> 00:43:04,831
He's a bit tyrannical

815
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:07,647
Totalitarian

816
00:43:07,903 --> 00:43:10,719
A little bit but he's a good man

817
00:43:10,975 --> 00:43:15,583
He just thinks the government is good for everybody like also I figured it out

818
00:43:16,351 --> 00:43:16,863
I figured it out

819
00:43:17,887 --> 00:43:18,399
Ben Carson

820
00:43:18,911 --> 00:43:19,423
Very very

821
00:43:20,191 --> 00:43:20,703
Super smart

822
00:43:21,471 --> 00:43:22,239
The pyramid

823
00:43:22,495 --> 00:43:23,519
It's filled with green

824
00:43:24,799 --> 00:43:26,335
Are the same. Pyramid

825
00:43:26,847 --> 00:43:27,359
That weren't

826
00:43:27,615 --> 00:43:28,127
It's built by the

827
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:30,175
That could be

828
00:43:30,431 --> 00:43:35,295
Well guys

829
00:43:35,551 --> 00:43:37,087
You'll never know how

830
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:40,927
Mediocre that joke really was he found the guy who organized

831
00:43:41,183 --> 00:43:41,951
The

832
00:43:42,207 --> 00:43:45,791

00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:52,703
We're taking down these Confederate statues next thing raps take down the pyramids slaves built

835
00:43:53,983 --> 00:43:54,751
Go.

836
00:43:55,007 --> 00:43:55,519
Love it

837
00:43:58,591 --> 00:44:01,663
Slaves built some of some of them yet

838
00:44:01,919 --> 00:44:02,687
A joke

839
00:44:02,943 --> 00:44:04,991

There's some stats

848
00:44:20,863 --> 00:44:22,911
Okay

849
00:44:23,167 --> 00:44:23,935
Weird

850
00:44:24,447 --> 00:44:25,215
Descriptive

851
00:44:26,751 --> 00:44:29,311
Numbers

852
00:44:32,383 --> 00:44:34,175
You're going to find out in just a minute

853
00:44:34,687 --> 00:44:40,831
And so they all have their special Garden for special drug their clean vaccines

00:44:41,343 --> 00:44:46,463
Got their own food trucks around Jets their own everything in line they're all

855
00:44:49,279 --> 00:44:51,583
7000 people on planet

856
00:44:52,351 --> 00:44:53,887
In their own words are aware of this

857
00:44:54,143 --> 00:45:00,287
And they just totally try to just get ready and they're all very scared in the elite

858
00:45:00,543 --> 00:45:04,127
For the Earth

859
00:45:04,383 --> 00:45:10,527
Population

860
00:45:10,783 --> 00:45:16,927
Populations to the plants

861
00:45:23,327 --> 00:45:25,887
The truth is your control

862
00:45:26,143 --> 00:45:32,287
Promise all this power by your masters

863
00:45:32,543 --> 00:45:33,311
When it gets down

864
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:40,223
The deeper level of statement

865
00:45:40,479 --> 00:45:41,759
100 million

866
00:45:45,343 --> 00:45:47,903
Wait but why what's up

867
00:45:48,159 --> 00:45:49,695
He's talking directly to like

868
00:45:49,951 --> 00:45:50,975
Douglas Taffer

869
00:45:51,231 --> 00:45:53,023
Yeah like a PA

870
00:45:53,279 --> 00:45:56,607
Going around like okay

871
00:45:57,119 --> 00:46:03,263
I'm afraid of this guy so I will set up all these

872
00:46:03,519 --> 00:46:09,663
Population

873
00:46:09,919 --> 00:46:10,943
Jones

874
00:46:11,711 --> 00:46:13,759
They're not going to give me the life extension

875
00:46:14,015 --> 00:46:20,159
I'm not going to

876
00:46:21,439 --> 00:46:22,463
That's great

877
00:46:22,719 --> 00:46:23,231
Their staff

878
00:46:25,023 --> 00:46:29,119
Their nature is not going to change as they continue

879
00:46:30,911 --> 00:46:32,191
You complete

880
00:46:33,215 --> 00:46:35,519
You're not

881
00:46:37,567 --> 00:46:39,871
By the system okay

882
00:46:41,407 --> 00:46:41,919
That's cool

883
00:46:42,431 --> 00:46:44,735
Some of these people and they know that

884
00:46:45,247 --> 00:46:46,783
What are you doing

885
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:53,183
Because let me tell you these people start turning against their masters real quick

886
00:46:57,279 --> 00:46:59,327
I spiritually have announced that I'm not part of

887
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:01,631
Hands off

00:47:03,167 --> 00:47:06,751
Older sub Corruptions

889
00:47:07,263 --> 00:47:08,031
Before

890
00:47:09,055 --> 00:47:11,359
Sublevel where I wake up and I'm in their hands

891
00:47:14,175 --> 00:47:18,015
What's this is the master seduction of humanity

892
00:47:19,039 --> 00:47:25,183
The Bible is run by an ancient powerful entities with super advanced intelligence

893
00:47:25,439 --> 00:47:29,791
Call

894
00:47:30,047 --> 00:47:34,911

Envisions the double-helix of DNA Invision Envision science

897

Social engineering

Charles Darwin his cousin Alex

899
00:47:53,087 --> 00:47:55,391

900
00:47:57,439 --> 00:47:58,719

Futurize Technologies

00:48:13,823 --> 00:48:15,103
Like global

Google downloads

909
00:48:18,175 --> 00:48:20,735
Love the hyper-intelligent demon

910
00:48:23,039 --> 00:48:29,183
Which book of the Bible is that I don't remember

911
00:48:29,439 --> 00:48:30,719
Are you talkin about how you guys met

912
00:48:30,975 --> 00:48:32,767
Need to give up all of your local religion

00:48:38,399 --> 00:48:39,167
Established

915
00:48:39,423 --> 00:48:44,031
Make sure that you're not bothering each other

916
00:48:44,543 --> 00:48:46,847
Is my basic Point again

917
00:48:47,103 --> 00:48:47,871
Just to reiterate

918
00:48:48,383 --> 00:48:54,015
Super intelligent living underneath you at all times

919
00:48:57,087 --> 00:49:00,159
He's going to start getting Charles Darwin to think about stuff

920
00:49:05,023 --> 00:49:11,167
I love this I love that he believes that human creativity and Innovation and progress

921
00:49:11,423 --> 00:49:14,495
All this stuff but can't believe the people would come up with creative ideas

922
00:49:14,751 --> 00:49:17,055
Understand it's only

923
00:49:17,311 --> 00:49:20,895
It's only Superstar how to be a demon

924
00:49:21,919 --> 00:49:23,967
Huge parallel between what

925
00:49:24,223 --> 00:49:24,991
I just heard it

926
00:49:25,503 --> 00:49:28,063
A huge parallel between what do you say

927
00:49:28,831 --> 00:49:31,647
About how

928
00:49:31,903 --> 00:49:35,487
They're Masters don't care about you

929
00:49:35,743 --> 00:49:37,279
You can't change their nature

930
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:42,399
Alex

931
00:49:42,655 --> 00:49:43,679
Personally with his

932
00:49:44,959 --> 00:49:45,471
Yeah

933
00:49:46,495 --> 00:49:48,287
Line by line that's what happen

934
00:49:52,383 --> 00:49:55,199
Paranoia is exactly what has happened

935
00:49:55,711 --> 00:49:56,735
Damn right now

936
00:49:56,991 --> 00:50:03,135
Paranoid mindset that tears apart every

937
00:50:05,183 --> 00:50:06,975
Look even look at it like I mentioned

938
00:50:07,231 --> 00:50:11,839
The Trump Administration is being sort of the microcosm of that

939
00:50:12,095 --> 00:50:15,167
Can staph look how quickly people just show up and leave

940
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:18,751
Still haven't

941
00:50:19,007 --> 00:50:23,359
Norfolk

942
00:50:23,871 --> 00:50:24,639
Shows back up

943
00:50:24,895 --> 00:50:27,455
Occasionally now but clearly is on a

944
00:50:27,711 --> 00:50:29,503
Real real Longley

945
00:50:30,015 --> 00:50:31,551
In the episode that we

946
00:50:31,807 --> 00:50:33,087
Tell recording didn't put out

947
00:50:33,343 --> 00:50:39,487
When he's interviewing Jason Kessler the guy who organized the United the right rally he accuses him of being a pet

948
00:50:40,255 --> 00:50:43,583
Right I mean there is Jeff they complete destructive

949
00:50:44,095 --> 00:50:46,655
A force that's within paranoia

950
00:50:46,911 --> 00:50:47,423
Evil

951
00:50:47,679 --> 00:50:48,703
Itself from within

952
00:50:48,959 --> 00:50:49,727
Right

953
00:50:52,287 --> 00:50:53,823
Will Shakespeare

954
00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:54,591
Dragonlance

955
00:50:54,847 --> 00:50:57,151
The end of everything that's important

956
00:50:57,407 --> 00:50:58,431
On October 1st

957
00:50:59,455 --> 00:51:03,807
Let me see is there anything else that I worth talking about on this episode

958
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:06,367
Distributive not Nigerian prince

959
00:51:06,623 --> 00:51:08,415
Oh no this is worth talking about

960
00:51:08,671 --> 00:51:11,231
He takes calls for a long time on the show

961
00:51:12,767 --> 00:51:18,911
Think about Trump

962
00:51:19,167 --> 00:51:25,311
Call

963
00:51:27,359 --> 00:51:30,431
Raptor

964
00:51:30,687 --> 00:51:31,199
Fantastic

965
00:51:31,455 --> 00:51:34,271
You have no idea

966
00:51:34,527 --> 00:51:36,575
He has no qualms using people's fake names

967
00:51:36,831 --> 00:51:38,111
Respect

968
00:51:38,367 --> 00:51:41,439
But be that as it may. Call not work.

969
00:51:41,951 --> 00:51:43,231
But now we get onto October see

970
00:51:44,767 --> 00:51:45,279
It's kind of ground

971
00:51:46,047 --> 00:51:48,351
I think October 6th is a really big day for Alec

972
00:51:51,167 --> 00:51:51,679
Nephew

973
00:51:51,935 --> 00:51:54,495
But

974
00:51:54,751 --> 00:51:56,543
If the musical

975
00:51:59,103 --> 00:52:02,431
It's going to go away better than the Spider-Man free shows on Broadway

976
00:52:02,687 --> 00:52:05,247
The undoubtedly

977
00:52:05,759 --> 00:52:08,319
I will get to he's in a weird place and then something

978
00:52:09,087 --> 00:52:15,231
But he's mad about guns

979
00:52:15,487 --> 00:52:16,767
White people

980
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:26,239
Anyways I want zero gun laws

981
00:52:26,495 --> 00:52:31,103
Doesn't track we have a pretty clear statement of his position

982
00:52:31,615 --> 00:52:32,383
Viva vegan

983
00:52:32,639 --> 00:52:38,783
No gun law everybody gets everybody

984
00:52:39,039 --> 00:52:45,183
Are we check government program that gives everybody

985
00:52:46,207 --> 00:52:46,719
Absolutely

986
00:52:48,767 --> 00:52:53,119
Serious about that about that

987
00:52:55,167 --> 00:52:56,191
Okay new pet

988
00:52:56,959 --> 00:52:58,495
Everybody can have a gun

989
00:52:58,751 --> 00:52:59,519
No gun laws

990
00:52:59,775 --> 00:53:01,311
But every gun is stamped

991
00:53:01,567 --> 00:53:02,335
Brought to you by Obama

992
00:53:07,711 --> 00:53:09,247
Everybody everybody gets a gun

993
00:53:09,503 --> 00:53:10,783
You just have to give it to us

994
00:53:11,039 --> 00:53:13,087
We stamp them with with

995
00:53:15,903 --> 00:53:16,415
I'm not into it

996
00:53:16,671 --> 00:53:19,743
Background check

997
00:53:19,999 --> 00:53:20,511
Text chat like that

998
00:53:21,023 --> 00:53:25,119
I don't think it's great just because you know that people can get guns illegally

999
00:53:25,375 --> 00:53:26,399
Doesn't mean you should

1000
00:53:26,655 --> 00:53:30,751
Lags all the rules about like

1001
00:53:31,007 --> 00:53:33,567
Alright no nuclear proliferation laws

1002
00:53:33,823 --> 00:53:38,175
Rogue nations are going to end up getting nuclear-weapons eventually

1003
00:53:38,431 --> 00:53:39,967
You know why even try

1004
00:53:40,223 --> 00:53:41,247
From getting it

1005
00:53:41,503 --> 00:53:42,783
Background check

1006
00:53:43,039 --> 00:53:44,319
For that guy who is

1007
00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:47,135
Convicted of domestic violence

1008
00:53:47,391 --> 00:53:51,231
Multiple times you don't want anybody looking into that because those guys

1009
00:53:52,767 --> 00:53:54,815
Main people who kill people

1010
00:53:56,607 --> 00:53:59,423
75% of the people

1011
00:53:59,679 --> 00:54:00,191
Terrorist attack

1012
00:54:00,959 --> 00:54:05,567
You're being bigoted against

1013
00:54:05,823 --> 00:54:07,871
That's what the back.

1014
00:54:08,127 --> 00:54:11,199
At the end of the day it would save so many more lives if

1015
00:54:11,455 --> 00:54:12,223
It was just like looking

1016
00:54:12,479 --> 00:54:13,247
Into whether or not

1017
00:54:13,503 --> 00:54:14,015
Dude

1018
00:54:15,039 --> 00:54:18,879
Unfortunately unfortunately I don't think a lot of those things

1019
00:54:19,135 --> 00:54:21,695
Can show up on background check

1020
00:54:21,951 --> 00:54:26,047
Convictions that happened for domestic abuse

1021
00:54:26,303 --> 00:54:26,815
Incident

1022
00:54:27,071 --> 00:54:30,399
Through the roof so unfortunately that might not be effective but yeah I agree

1023
00:54:31,935 --> 00:54:32,703
To get a f******

1024
00:54:33,727 --> 00:54:34,751
From a breeder

1025
00:54:35,007 --> 00:54:35,775
Over breeder

1026
00:54:36,799 --> 00:54:37,567
Like

1027
00:54:40,127 --> 00:54:46,015
From like a pound or something like that she was giving 50 bucks

1028
00:54:46,527 --> 00:54:49,855
I got my cat just showed up and gave him money

1029
00:54:50,367 --> 00:54:52,927
So what

1030
00:54:53,183 --> 00:54:56,767
Keep one of the eyes

1031
00:54:57,279 --> 00:54:58,303
That's why you're Pepsi

1032
00:54:58,559 --> 00:55:00,095
Okay so much better than everybody else

1033
00:55:01,631 --> 00:55:04,447
With dogs and cats if you go to Humane Society you just give them likes

1034
00:55:04,959 --> 00:55:05,471
D-box

1035
00:55:05,727 --> 00:55:06,751
To cover the shots

1036
00:55:08,543 --> 00:55:10,847
I know what you're trying to say it's also

1037
00:55:11,103 --> 00:55:13,663
There's this reason that

1038
00:55:14,175 --> 00:55:14,943
Yeah

1039
00:55:15,455 --> 00:55:17,503
Like I said in a weird place

1040
00:55:17,759 --> 00:55:19,295
He's faking a lot of

1041
00:55:20,063 --> 00:55:21,343
Protocol ailments

1042
00:55:21,855 --> 00:55:22,879
On this episode

1043
00:55:23,391 --> 00:55:25,439
He might be like a kid trying to get out of class

1044
00:55:25,695 --> 00:55:29,023
He actually has feelings

1045
00:55:29,535 --> 00:55:31,327
The first one where he

1046
00:55:31,583 --> 00:55:32,863
He really hams it up

1047
00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:36,191
About what he's feeling

1048
00:55:36,447 --> 00:55:37,215
This is one today

1049
00:55:42,591 --> 00:55:46,687
I mean I know I guess

1050
00:55:47,199 --> 00:55:47,711
Because

1051
00:55:47,967 --> 00:55:48,991
All this was coming

1052
00:55:49,247 --> 00:55:50,783
The old-timers were hundred percent right

1053
00:55:51,039 --> 00:55:52,063
But now it's all here

1054
00:55:52,319 --> 00:55:53,343
It show

1055
00:55:55,135 --> 00:55:55,647
Criminal

1056
00:56:02,047 --> 00:56:03,327
If you say it's not drama it's totally

1057
00:56:07,679 --> 00:56:13,823
Occupied country

1058
00:56:15,615 --> 00:56:16,127
They are

1059
00:56:17,663 --> 00:56:21,247
They hate everyone

1060
00:56:21,503 --> 00:56:22,783
They are the Pierce come

1061
00:56:23,039 --> 00:56:27,135
The corporation

1062
00:56:27,391 --> 00:56:31,999
They're going to hurt everyone they hate everybody they are stroking

1063
00:56:42,239 --> 00:56:48,383
A lot of a Sienna be like watching some guy with a big pot belly

1064
00:56:48,639 --> 00:56:49,151
Peter

1065
00:56:49,663 --> 00:56:53,247
800-pound wife

1066
00:57:02,719 --> 00:57:06,815
And people on the world Hip-Hop star

1067
00:57:07,071 --> 00:57:08,607
I physically get it all

1068
00:57:09,119 --> 00:57:14,751
Because they turn people into such scum and nnn people

1069
00:57:17,055 --> 00:57:18,335
I physically important

1070
00:57:18,847 --> 00:57:19,871
Only physically threatened

1071
00:57:20,383 --> 00:57:22,943
You always talking about he's just talking about all the

1072
00:57:23,199 --> 00:57:26,527
Videos that he watches of black people beating up white people

1073
00:57:26,783 --> 00:57:28,831
Featherstone Worldstar

1074
00:57:29,087 --> 00:57:31,903
He's just talking about how scared he is about lightning

1075
00:57:32,671 --> 00:57:34,207
That makes him physically ill

1076
00:57:34,463 --> 00:57:40,095
It's a nice reveal that he comes to at the end there that that's what's making them feel that way

1077
00:57:40,607 --> 00:57:41,119
Guitar

1078
00:57:42,399 --> 00:57:43,423
I've had tons of

1079
00:57:43,679 --> 00:57:44,703
Contacts that last rough

1080
00:57:48,031 --> 00:57:49,567
To speak coherently throughout

1081
00:57:49,823 --> 00:57:51,871
On a live broadcast

1082
00:57:52,127 --> 00:57:54,431
Comment

1083
00:57:56,735 --> 00:57:57,503
Blind Pilot

1084
00:57:58,015 --> 00:58:04,159
So all the other stuff is very standard Alex Jones

1085
00:58:04,671 --> 00:58:09,023
We just mention that they put her in the vaccines

1086
00:58:09,535 --> 00:58:10,047
Stuff like that

1087
00:58:12,095 --> 00:58:12,863
Explain danhauer

1088
00:58:13,119 --> 00:58:13,631
You can put cancer

1089
00:58:13,887 --> 00:58:14,399
Vaccine

1090
00:58:16,191 --> 00:58:17,727
No it never really gets into

1091
00:58:17,983 --> 00:58:21,311
Do the specifics of it but if you really look into it but the only thing

1092
00:58:21,567 --> 00:58:22,847
Think you really can be referencing

1093
00:58:23,359 --> 00:58:25,151
I is Vape

1094
00:58:26,431 --> 00:58:27,967
Presence of simian virus

1095
00:58:28,223 --> 00:58:28,735
40

1096
00:58:28,991 --> 00:58:30,271
I would realize

1097
00:58:30,527 --> 00:58:32,319
Some of the cell cultures that they used in

1098
00:58:32,575 --> 00:58:33,087
In the preparation

1099
00:58:33,343 --> 00:58:34,367
The polio vaccine

1100
00:58:34,879 --> 00:58:36,927
Between 1955 and 90

1101
00:58:37,439 --> 00:58:37,951
61

1102
00:58:38,463 --> 00:58:40,767
I've accidentally they didn't know this

1103
00:58:41,023 --> 00:58:44,863
But it led to a very high rate of mesothelioma

1104
00:58:45,375 --> 00:58:47,167
And increase rate of bone

1105
00:58:47,423 --> 00:58:47,935
Tumors

1106
00:58:48,191 --> 00:58:48,959
That

1107
00:58:49,471 --> 00:58:49,983
Was

1108
00:58:50,495 --> 00:58:51,263
Statistically

1109
00:58:51,775 --> 00:58:54,591
Hire it statistically relevant compared to

1110
00:58:54,847 --> 00:58:55,871
Xenon

1111
00:58:56,127 --> 00:58:57,151
Right

1112
00:58:58,175 --> 00:59:00,991
A lot of times he's really misrepresenting and just talking about

1113
00:59:01,247 --> 00:59:02,015
Temple side effects

1114
00:59:02,783 --> 00:59:04,319
That are natural or you

1115
00:59:04,575 --> 00:59:06,367
It is inflating stiff

1116
00:59:06,879 --> 00:59:09,183
In this case what he's doing is talking about

1117
00:59:10,719 --> 00:59:12,511
Bad science

1118
00:59:12,767 --> 00:59:13,791
Didn't get caught

1119
00:59:14,047 --> 00:59:15,327
We didn't know any better

1120
00:59:15,583 --> 00:59:17,631
The ended in 1961

1121
00:59:18,399 --> 00:59:18,911
So

1122
00:59:22,495 --> 00:59:26,079
Told you it ended Dan

1123
00:59:26,335 --> 00:59:26,847
That's because

1124
00:59:27,103 --> 00:59:28,383
Proto infowarrior

1125
00:59:28,639 --> 00:59:30,175
Was around in 1960

1126
00:59:30,431 --> 00:59:31,711
51 was it

1127
00:59:31,967 --> 00:59:34,271
One of Alex Jones has previously

1128
00:59:34,783 --> 00:59:37,087
No

1129
00:59:37,343 --> 00:59:37,855
Entire time

1130
00:59:39,903 --> 00:59:40,671
No

1131
00:59:42,463 --> 00:59:43,231
Neuroscientist

1132
00:59:43,487 --> 00:59:44,511
No somebody found this out

1133
00:59:44,767 --> 00:59:46,815
Stop it

1134
00:59:47,071 --> 00:59:47,583
A leaker

1135
00:59:51,935 --> 00:59:52,703
And then they stopped

1136
00:59:53,471 --> 00:59:53,983
Publicly

1137
00:59:54,239 --> 00:59:55,263
But this has been Declassified

1138
00:59:58,847 --> 01:00:03,711
No there was a study and there's a study 1991

1139
01:00:03,967 --> 01:00:04,991
5 a.m.

1140
01:00:05,247 --> 01:00:06,015
Anticancer research

1141
01:00:06,527 --> 01:00:07,039
Association

1142
01:00:07,551 --> 01:00:08,831
That

1143
01:00:09,087 --> 01:00:09,855
It's 1999

1144
01:00:11,391 --> 01:00:11,903
You know

1145
01:00:12,159 --> 01:00:14,207
Set timer

1146
01:00:14,463 --> 01:00:15,487
Sometimes they f******

1147
01:00:18,303 --> 01:00:18,815
It's

1148
01:00:19,071 --> 01:00:23,679
It's not some sort of terrible plot the conclusion of the study

1149
01:00:23,935 --> 01:00:25,727
The conclusion of the study that they found is

1150
01:00:25,983 --> 01:00:27,519
The data suggests that there may be an in

1151
01:00:27,775 --> 01:00:28,287
Increased incidence

1152
01:00:28,799 --> 01:00:30,847
I'm certain cancers among the 98 million persons

1153
01:00:31,103 --> 01:00:31,615
Exposed

1154
01:00:31,871 --> 01:00:32,383
Contaminated

1155
01:00:32,639 --> 01:00:34,175
Poliovirus in the United States

1156
01:00:34,431 --> 01:00:35,199
Further investigation

1157
01:00:35,455 --> 01:00:36,479
The clearly Justified

1158
01:00:36,735 --> 01:00:38,783
Even in the studies that they've done

1159
01:00:39,039 --> 01:00:40,319
There is no causation

1160
01:00:40,831 --> 01:00:42,879
Necessarily that is ascribed

1161
01:00:43,647 --> 01:00:47,487
It's probably it looks like this is probably a player

1162
01:00:47,743 --> 01:00:48,767
And not in that

1163
01:00:49,023 --> 01:00:51,327
So what I'm saying is it's not evil globalist

1164
01:00:51,839 --> 01:00:52,351
8

1165
01:00:52,607 --> 01:00:53,631
Science in the fifth

1166
01:00:55,679 --> 01:00:56,191
Yeah

1167
01:00:57,983 --> 01:00:59,007
Where do you think

1168
01:01:02,079 --> 01:01:02,591
Wawa

1169
01:01:03,103 --> 01:01:04,127
Super intelligent

1170
01:01:06,431 --> 01:01:06,943
Demon

1171
01:01:07,199 --> 01:01:07,711
Exactly

1172
01:01:07,967 --> 01:01:11,295
Hyper-intelligent

1173
01:01:14,879 --> 01:01:15,647
Throwing up because you

1174
01:01:15,903 --> 01:01:17,439
You scared what's going to happen to white people

1175
01:01:17,695 --> 01:01:19,743
Random is next episode of fakes

1176
01:01:19,999 --> 01:01:20,767
But he's going to throw up again

1177
01:01:21,023 --> 01:01:23,839
What do you think the American people can do to stop please

1178
01:01:24,351 --> 01:01:27,167
Prom queen

1179
01:01:27,679 --> 01:01:28,959
I almost threw up

1180
01:01:30,239 --> 01:01:35,615
Good morning that bad right now

1181
01:01:38,175 --> 01:01:40,991
One time and I went to the CPS meeting and watch the judge

1182
01:01:41,759 --> 01:01:43,551
Take the kid from the family for no reason

1183
01:01:56,095 --> 01:02:00,959
Ducks shop in chest get worse from here it's so over-the-top

1184
01:02:02,495 --> 01:02:03,519
Covert

1185
01:02:05,311 --> 01:02:07,103
Alright Nikki and public

1186
01:02:07,359 --> 01:02:07,871
That's

1187
01:02:08,639 --> 01:02:09,919
That's some real next level

1188
01:02:10,431 --> 01:02:11,711
Absolutely

1189
01:02:11,967 --> 01:02:15,551
I'm so in this next clip Alex wants to brag about Amanda

1190
01:02:15,807 --> 01:02:17,599
He is after faking a panic attack

1191
01:02:18,111 --> 01:02:19,903
He's going to throw up

1192
01:02:20,415 --> 01:02:21,695
Listen this is genuine

1193
01:02:21,951 --> 01:02:22,975
I truly feel this

1194
01:02:23,231 --> 01:02:23,743
Listen

1195
01:02:23,999 --> 01:02:25,279
This is totally genuine

1196
01:02:25,791 --> 01:02:27,071
I really feel these

1197
01:02:28,863 --> 01:02:31,935
I filleted don't believe that heals anything

1198
01:02:34,751 --> 01:02:38,079
Fear and paranoia

1199
01:02:38,335 --> 01:02:39,615
You lies about a fight

1200
01:02:44,735 --> 01:02:47,039
And the guy was

1201
01:02:48,831 --> 01:02:49,855
Phlebotomist

1202
01:02:50,111 --> 01:02:53,695
People on here what you doing down the street

1203
01:02:57,791 --> 01:03:02,143
Establishment

1204
01:03:02,911 --> 01:03:05,983
I bet you're a little leftist you don't want the right way

1205
01:03:06,239 --> 01:03:09,567
I'm more or less

1206
01:03:12,895 --> 01:03:19,039
I'm going to walk out of here

1207
01:03:24,415 --> 01:03:29,279
Oh I see you're not so tough now you think I'm one of these people been here all day

1208
01:03:30,303 --> 01:03:31,839
Let's go

1209
01:03:55,135 --> 01:03:57,183
Just looks like

1210
01:03:57,695 --> 01:04:03,071
What do I do what I do

1211
01:04:03,327 --> 01:04:08,191
I just was telling that story about being really manly and not getting into a fight

1212
01:04:08,703 --> 01:04:13,823
Why did I do that he had no idea and then

1213
01:04:14,079 --> 01:04:15,103
F****** 10

1214
01:04:15,359 --> 01:04:16,895
15-second pause

1215
01:04:23,039 --> 01:04:25,599
Skip another break after earlier

1216
01:04:30,463 --> 01:04:31,999
Best stories

1217
01:04:32,511 --> 01:04:34,303
Not true

1218
01:04:34,815 --> 01:04:36,351
I don't have that story

1219
01:04:37,119 --> 01:04:39,167
The point of the story I believe

1220
01:04:39,423 --> 01:04:42,495
Is that there are people in the world

1221
01:04:42,751 --> 01:04:47,359
But he also knows

1222
01:04:47,615 --> 01:04:48,895
Kansas Granby and everybody up

1223
01:04:49,151 --> 01:04:54,015
He's got to let him know that he will beat them up

1224
01:04:54,271 --> 01:04:55,551
Otherwise they'll think that he would

1225
01:04:55,807 --> 01:04:58,623
Only want to fight him because

1226
01:04:58,879 --> 01:05:00,415
The globalist minions

1227
01:05:02,207 --> 01:05:02,719
Power Trip

1228
01:05:03,231 --> 01:05:04,511
But the reality is

1229
01:05:04,767 --> 01:05:05,791
Then Alex knows

1230
01:05:06,815 --> 01:05:07,327
Victims

1231
01:05:07,839 --> 01:05:09,375
He doesn't want to beat up victims

1232
01:05:10,143 --> 01:05:10,655
Kind of does

1233
01:05:10,911 --> 01:05:12,703
I really wanted to beat that guy

1234
01:05:15,775 --> 01:05:18,335
Or if you did that story the reality of it is

1235
01:05:18,591 --> 01:05:19,103
Very

1236
01:05:19,871 --> 01:05:20,383
Yeah yeah

1237
01:05:20,639 --> 01:05:22,687
Sounds like Alex

1238
01:05:23,199 --> 01:05:24,479
Probably

1239
01:05:24,735 --> 01:05:25,247
I would assume

1240
01:05:25,503 --> 01:05:27,039
And they were like

1241
01:05:28,063 --> 01:05:28,575
Calm down

1242
01:05:28,831 --> 01:05:29,599
Get your

1243
01:05:29,855 --> 01:05:30,623
You're being really

1244
01:05:31,647 --> 01:05:37,791
It's very difficult to have my bar

1245
01:05:38,047 --> 01:05:38,559
Yeah

1246
01:05:40,863 --> 01:05:45,215
You you and your friend want to come fight me outside I hate your ass

1247
01:05:45,471 --> 01:05:50,335
Elsa fight you I'll kick your ass I see you're one of these controllers

1248
01:05:50,847 --> 01:05:53,407
You're just drunk drunk

1249
01:05:54,175 --> 01:05:55,455
You're drunk your globalist

1250
01:05:55,967 --> 01:05:57,247
Alex

1251
01:05:59,039 --> 01:06:00,319
I am on the left

1252
01:06:02,879 --> 01:06:09,023
But you are further less than 11

1253
01:06:09,279 --> 01:06:10,559
Far to the left of me

1254
01:06:11,071 --> 01:06:15,679
Where did you get that table on top of a bottle of Jack Daniels

1255
01:06:16,191 --> 01:06:20,287
Where'd you get that where'd you get that thing that pours out a shot at a time

1256
01:06:20,543 --> 01:06:22,591
Did you get it from a hyper demon

1257
01:06:23,615 --> 01:06:24,383
Cyberdemon

1258
01:06:25,151 --> 01:06:26,687
Intelligent demon

1259
01:06:27,455 --> 01:06:28,479
Technology

1260
01:06:28,991 --> 01:06:30,271
Dolphin

1261
01:06:30,527 --> 01:06:32,063
Galt

1262
01:06:32,575 --> 01:06:38,207
The devil

1263
01:06:38,463 --> 01:06:41,535
Deceived the devil every night when he goes to bed

1264
01:06:42,559 --> 01:06:43,327
Bulbulay

1265
01:06:43,583 --> 01:06:44,863
So yeah that didn't

1266
01:06:45,375 --> 01:06:45,887
This next

1267
01:06:46,911 --> 01:06:49,727
I'm going to tell you that I only have

1268
01:06:49,983 --> 01:06:51,519
A small awareness

1269
01:06:53,055 --> 01:06:53,823
But he's talking about

1270
01:06:54,335 --> 01:06:55,615
It's very complicated

1271
01:06:55,871 --> 01:06:57,407
I didn't have time to look into it

1272
01:06:57,663 --> 01:07:00,735
I had enough time to look into it enough to know that he's lying

1273
01:07:01,247 --> 01:07:02,527
I'm keeping this in

1274
01:07:03,039 --> 01:07:03,807
The show

1275
01:07:04,063 --> 01:07:04,831
What a cocky prick

1276
01:07:05,087 --> 01:07:05,599
Kia's

1277
01:07:05,855 --> 01:07:07,391
And at the end he says

1278
01:07:07,903 --> 01:07:08,671
It's very telling

1279
01:07:08,927 --> 01:07:10,207
About his beliefs about vaccine

1280
01:07:10,975 --> 01:07:13,023
And that's the reason I got to keep it in even though

1281
01:07:13,535 --> 01:07:14,047
Camp

1282
01:07:14,303 --> 01:07:15,327
Fully unpacked

1283
01:07:15,583 --> 01:07:16,607
GnRH for you

1284
01:07:17,119 --> 01:07:17,631
Which is

1285
01:07:18,143 --> 01:07:20,191
Will get yours down the other side of the Sun

1286
01:07:28,383 --> 01:07:30,175
In feral animal population

1287
01:07:30,431 --> 01:07:31,455
A similar approach

1288
01:07:31,711 --> 01:07:36,063
31-day spur the development of long-term birth control options for human

1289
01:07:36,575 --> 01:07:38,111
This looks incredibly promising

1290
01:07:38,367 --> 01:07:40,927
William Swanson director animal research

1291
01:07:41,183 --> 01:07:43,487
Cincinnati Zoo in Ohio

1292
01:07:52,191 --> 01:07:58,335
To get their resources of already response in animals

1293
01:08:07,295 --> 01:08:08,575
Dumb gringo

1294
01:08:09,343 --> 01:08:10,879
I want to stop right there for a second

1295
01:08:11,135 --> 01:08:13,951
This is a anytime he brings of Gardasil you only mentioned

1296
01:08:14,207 --> 01:08:15,231
In the context of Hispanic

1297
01:08:15,999 --> 01:08:19,583
Which is very weird cuz it works for everybody

1298
01:08:19,839 --> 01:08:20,607
Because he's racist

1299
01:08:20,863 --> 01:08:27,007
Okay because he wants to use it as a way to take potshots at

1300
01:08:28,287 --> 01:08:29,055
Maraza

1301
01:08:29,311 --> 01:08:31,103
Because he thinks Our Gang organizations

1302
01:08:32,895 --> 01:08:37,247
RH is the thing that he's talking about

1303
01:08:37,759 --> 01:08:40,063
Gonadotropins releasing hormone

1304
01:08:40,575 --> 01:08:42,623
And they were experimenting with

1305
01:08:42,879 --> 01:08:43,903
In terms of being able to

1306
01:08:44,159 --> 01:08:46,719
Create sterility and animals bunch more effectively

1307
01:08:48,255 --> 01:08:49,791
Just like spaying or neutering

1308
01:08:50,047 --> 01:08:51,839
Yeah and also it was

1309
01:08:52,095 --> 01:08:56,447
Something that I believe was discussed as a means of birth control

1310
01:08:56,703 --> 01:08:57,983
They could be applied to humans

1311
01:08:58,239 --> 01:08:59,007
Because

1312
01:09:00,031 --> 01:09:01,823
One of the things that they found in the study

1313
01:09:02,079 --> 01:09:03,103
Was that it did

1314
01:09:03,359 --> 01:09:04,895
Make the animals in

1315
01:09:05,151 --> 01:09:07,199
Infertile while their treatments were going on

1316
01:09:07,455 --> 01:09:10,527
But then as soon as 9 months after

1317
01:09:10,783 --> 01:09:12,831
IV treatments for ceased

1318
01:09:13,087 --> 01:09:14,879
All of the animals in the studies regain their

1319
01:09:15,135 --> 01:09:17,695
Infertility

1320
01:09:17,951 --> 01:09:21,023
Yeah out of 10 were infertile during

1321
01:09:25,887 --> 01:09:27,679
I am at 9 months later they were

1322
01:09:29,727 --> 01:09:30,239
Just okay

1323
01:09:31,519 --> 01:09:32,543
The birth control pill has a

1324
01:09:34,079 --> 01:09:36,383
Effective male birth

1325
01:09:36,895 --> 01:09:42,527
Great is that to it again it's not perfect and that's why

1326
01:09:43,039 --> 01:09:43,807
Hasn't been used

1327
01:09:44,063 --> 01:09:46,623
Humans and it hasn't developed for them that it's

1328
01:09:47,903 --> 01:09:51,487
It's a study that is interesting but maybe not Apple

1329
01:09:51,743 --> 01:09:53,279
And it's not

1330
01:09:53,535 --> 01:09:54,559
What I was down says it is

1331
01:09:55,071 --> 01:09:56,095
About like I said I don't

1332
01:09:56,351 --> 01:09:57,887
I don't fully understand all this

1333
01:09:58,143 --> 01:10:01,471
Sauce and I know Alex doesn't either cuz he's just reading off like a daily mail art

1334
01:10:02,239 --> 01:10:03,007
So

1335
01:10:04,031 --> 01:10:04,543
Anyway

1336
01:10:04,799 --> 01:10:09,407
Block

1337
01:10:10,943 --> 01:10:17,087
At this is hit GnRH that's when I got

1338
01:10:23,743 --> 01:10:25,023
Bio weapon

1339
01:10:29,375 --> 01:10:31,679
I've seen the show on other next

1340
01:10:32,191 --> 01:10:34,239
Nope trying to get blind

1341
01:10:35,007 --> 01:10:36,031
Cuz I only read the first

1342
01:10:39,615 --> 01:10:43,199
I only read the first line together hours

1343
01:10:55,231 --> 01:10:57,023
Response antibodies

1344
01:10:57,535 --> 01:11:03,679
Releasing hormone GnRH required by mammals to turn on the pathway

1345
01:11:04,703 --> 01:11:06,239
Trickblox in the first trimester

1346
01:11:09,311 --> 01:11:11,103
Inducing dear contraception

1347
01:11:11,615 --> 01:11:13,919
Go knock on Heaven show no effectively work

1348
01:11:14,431 --> 01:11:16,735
Are both male and female birth control

1349
01:11:16,991 --> 01:11:23,135
He doesn't understand any of these things that he saying either completely

1350
01:11:23,391 --> 01:11:29,535
He's the blocking of the GnRH it's already you're only use

1351
01:11:29,791 --> 01:11:30,559
Using it while you're

1352
01:11:30,815 --> 01:11:33,887
Sing

1353
01:11:34,143 --> 01:11:35,423
The blocking of the GnRH

1354
01:11:35,679 --> 01:11:36,703
This allows

1355
01:11:36,959 --> 01:11:38,239
The sperm and egg

1356
01:11:38,495 --> 01:11:39,263
From being produced

1357
01:11:39,775 --> 01:11:42,847
And from being accessible whatever however you want to put it

1358
01:11:43,359 --> 01:11:45,663
So he's been so in the first trimester

1359
01:11:45,919 --> 01:11:46,431
No it's

1360
01:11:46,687 --> 01:11:47,199
Before

1361
01:11:47,455 --> 01:11:49,247
It's before that call TriMet

1362
01:11:49,503 --> 01:11:53,343
Misrepresented

1363
01:11:53,599 --> 01:11:56,159
Get some how about a portion which it's not

1364
01:11:56,415 --> 01:11:57,183
Process

1365
01:11:57,439 --> 01:11:59,743
He's not doing a good job defending

1366
01:12:00,767 --> 01:12:04,607
He's not doing a good job reading the article

1367
01:12:10,495 --> 01:12:12,799
Use a booster shots every few years

1368
01:12:13,055 --> 01:12:19,199
Biologist Bruce hay in the California Institute of Technology

1369
01:12:19,455 --> 01:12:20,223
GnRH

1370
01:12:31,487 --> 01:12:32,255
That win

1371
01:12:32,511 --> 01:12:37,887
Interactive Rochelle's oh that sounds like

1372
01:12:40,447 --> 01:12:44,799
Turn the muscle cells into Auntie GnRH

1373
01:12:45,055 --> 01:12:46,847
That's turn your muscles into cancer

1374
01:12:47,359 --> 01:12:53,503
Spell Sparky

1375
01:12:53,759 --> 01:12:58,111
Because muscle cells are some of the longest lasting in the body

1376
01:12:58,367 --> 01:13:00,927
They continue to search for 10 years

1377
01:13:04,255 --> 01:13:08,095
From autoimmune disease

1378
01:13:15,519 --> 01:13:19,615
Reproduction not kilkee

1379
01:13:20,127 --> 01:13:22,175
We love you so much

1380
01:13:22,431 --> 01:13:25,759
We care about you and your family so much

1381
01:13:28,063 --> 01:13:31,647
I have to be cynical and evil about the I bet

1382
01:13:31,903 --> 01:13:34,975
That right there at the end was the reason I wanted to

1383
01:13:35,231 --> 01:13:38,047
Keep it in because he he shows his cards a little bit there

1384
01:13:38,303 --> 01:13:41,887
And that he believes that side effects that happen naturally insert

1385
01:13:42,399 --> 01:13:43,423
Small subgroup

1386
01:13:43,679 --> 01:13:44,447
Are the

1387
01:13:44,703 --> 01:13:45,983
Vaccine working

1388
01:13:48,031 --> 01:13:49,567
Which is really

1389
01:13:49,823 --> 01:13:50,335
Dumb

1390
01:13:51,103 --> 01:13:51,615
Insanely.

1391
01:13:51,871 --> 01:13:53,407
So I just wanted to

1392
01:13:53,919 --> 01:13:54,431
Do that

1393
01:13:55,711 --> 01:13:56,223
Childish

1394
01:13:56,479 --> 01:13:57,247
Bulshit moves

1395
01:13:59,039 --> 01:13:59,551
Cincinnati be like

1396
01:14:01,599 --> 01:14:02,367
Dismissed it out of

1397
01:14:04,415 --> 01:14:05,183
That's awful

1398
01:14:06,975 --> 01:14:09,279
Cuz he doesn't understand what he's talking about he's just

1399
01:14:10,047 --> 01:14:12,351
Speculating and saying everything

1400
01:14:12,607 --> 01:14:14,399
Autoimmune blah blah blah

1401
01:14:14,911 --> 01:14:16,959
And he's misrepresenting like

1402
01:14:18,495 --> 01:14:20,031
Science books

1403
01:14:20,287 --> 01:14:20,799
He's choosing

1404
01:14:21,055 --> 01:14:22,335
One word that he understand

1405
01:14:22,591 --> 01:14:23,103
And out of the lungs

1406
01:14:23,359 --> 01:14:24,127
Considering that he doesn't

1407
01:14:25,151 --> 01:14:25,663
She's playing like

1408
01:14:26,687 --> 01:14:28,223
Match this with whatever word you do

1409
01:14:28,479 --> 01:14:31,551
How to say words like

1410
01:14:32,063 --> 01:14:34,367
He's doing the positive thing but with

1411
01:14:34,623 --> 01:14:36,159
Basically is what he's doing there

1412
01:14:40,255 --> 01:14:40,767
I mean like

1413
01:14:41,023 --> 01:14:42,047
The stuff about

1414
01:14:42,815 --> 01:14:43,327
Putting

1415
01:14:44,607 --> 01:14:47,423
Stuff inside virus shells and stuff like that that's

1416
01:14:47,679 --> 01:14:48,447
Pretty common

1417
01:14:48,959 --> 01:14:49,727
No that's how you do

1418
01:14:49,983 --> 01:14:56,127
Yeah that's not that's not out there any hole

1419
01:14:56,639 --> 01:14:59,967
Actually understand any of the words involved

1420
01:15:00,223 --> 01:15:01,503
Escrowed

1421
01:15:01,759 --> 01:15:02,527
At this point

1422
01:15:03,295 --> 01:15:04,319
Everything Changes

1423
01:15:05,599 --> 01:15:10,207
Up till this point everything is Ban Alex faking illness who's talking about being manly

1424
01:15:10,719 --> 01:15:13,279
A couple of really stupid narrative

1425
01:15:15,327 --> 01:15:15,839
Coming in

1426
01:15:16,351 --> 01:15:17,119
Coming in hot

1427
01:15:17,375 --> 01:15:18,655
It's point of the show

1428
01:15:19,935 --> 01:15:21,215
Big big time

1429
01:15:21,983 --> 01:15:28,127
I have never had a deer in the headlights experience this crazy cuz I really

1430
01:15:28,383 --> 01:15:34,527
Drudge

1431
01:15:42,207 --> 01:15:45,279
And then he's hiding over there in the shadows right now I'm not kidding

1432
01:15:45,535 --> 01:15:47,071
Conspiracy theory

1433
01:15:52,191 --> 01:15:52,959
Is over there

1434
01:15:53,215 --> 01:15:58,591
Heart attack can you just walk over here behind the stage you're not coming

1435
01:15:58,847 --> 01:16:01,151
Stop saying it's

1436
01:16:01,663 --> 01:16:04,479
1puglife

1437
01:16:06,271 --> 01:16:09,087
Take a note

1438
01:16:10,367 --> 01:16:16,511
April Fools

April.

1440
01:16:19,583 --> 01:16:22,399
Supposed to go to rebroadcast

1441
01:16:29,055 --> 01:16:31,871
Oh my gosh

1442
01:16:47,487 --> 01:16:53,631
Alright well I'm not going to be aggressive and turn the lights on over there and in the document

1443
01:16:53,887 --> 01:16:58,239
I'm definitely going to have to

1444
01:17:01,311 --> 01:17:02,847
Alex is tumescent

1445
01:17:06,431 --> 01:17:07,711
That's the weirdest

1446
01:17:07,967 --> 01:17:09,503
Like schoolgirl

1447
01:17:10,783 --> 01:17:12,575
Wow this is bamboo

1448
01:17:19,743 --> 01:17:22,303
7 years ago me and Matt Drudge

01:17:24,351 --> 01:17:26,655
And she is taking it and all

1451
01:17:29,471 --> 01:17:33,055
That's why I Drudge.

1452
01:17:35,359 --> 01:17:37,663
It gets worse Alex's fan Bush it gets worse

1453
01:17:37,919 --> 01:17:39,455
Sandra Bullock

1454
01:17:40,223 --> 01:17:44,063
Anyways

1455
01:17:44,575 --> 01:17:45,343
Maybe

1456
01:17:45,599 --> 01:17:46,879
God would that be all right

1457
01:17:51,231 --> 01:17:53,023
Oh my God

1458
01:17:54,303 --> 01:17:56,095
What I look like Buckley when he walked in

1459
01:17:57,119 --> 01:18:03,007
Flabbergast who is that

1460
01:18:03,263 --> 01:18:04,543

01:18:12,223 --> 01:18:18,367
Anyways I was already super Roundup today I've already had too many DNA for assisted

1463
01:18:21,183 --> 01:18:23,743
I'm at the I'm not been drinking

1464
01:18:24,511 --> 01:18:26,559
Since last Thursday

1465
01:18:27,071 --> 01:18:27,839
And

1466
01:18:31,935 --> 01:18:32,959
I don't have any

1467
01:18:33,983 --> 01:18:35,263
Recall on tranquilizers

1468
01:18:35,775 --> 01:18:38,591
Equalizer.

1469
01:18:41,663 --> 01:18:44,991
Because I'm Starstruck right now

1470
01:18:45,247 --> 01:18:48,831
I have like

01:19:01,887 --> 01:19:02,399
You wasn't there

1472
01:19:02,911 --> 01:19:03,423
Guess what

1473
01:19:04,703 --> 01:19:05,215
He wasn't there

1474
01:19:05,727 --> 01:19:06,239
What

1475
01:19:06,495 --> 01:19:12,639
I'm getting used

1476
01:19:16,735 --> 01:19:22,879
Avenue just it's believable

1477
01:19:23,903 --> 01:19:26,463
Is definitely in the house

1478
01:19:28,511 --> 01:19:29,023
Man

1479
01:19:29,279 --> 01:19:31,583
Regular Alex was disgusting but

1480
01:19:33,119 --> 01:19:39,263
Weird and that like I've been a good boy I haven't drank since Thursday

1481
01:19:39,519 --> 01:19:41,567
F****** open microphone

1482
01:19:41,823 --> 01:19:44,383
Publix up dude you see at the bars every night like

1483
01:19:44,639 --> 01:19:45,663
Haven't drank in 3 days

1484
01:19:45,919 --> 01:19:52,063
Too pretty big for me on water

1485
01:20:00,511 --> 01:20:01,023
Too many

1486
01:20:01,279 --> 01:20:04,863
A worried about the

1487
01:20:05,119 --> 01:20:07,423
DNA Force like a a pet pillars

1488
01:20:07,679 --> 01:20:09,471
I think of the brain for

1489
01:20:09,727 --> 01:20:11,007
Probably what you meant to say

1490
01:20:11,263 --> 01:20:14,336
Is just supposed to keep your DNA from untangling

1491
01:20:18,688 --> 01:20:20,736
Something's not working

1492
01:20:22,272 --> 01:20:25,344
He's in the studio is very rare

1493
01:20:29,440 --> 01:20:31,488
During the break

1494
01:20:31,744 --> 01:20:32,512
With a mic

1495
01:20:32,768 --> 01:20:35,840
Add so he's not on video but he's on my

1496
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:38,912
You give

1497
01:20:39,168 --> 01:20:41,472
He gives a bit of an interview and he says I'm really dumb

1498
01:20:41,984 --> 01:20:43,264
And we'll get to that in a second

1499
01:20:44,544 --> 01:20:48,640
For those of you who don't know drudge is one of the most popular people in the world

1500
01:20:50,176 --> 01:20:51,456
With no sarcasm

1501
01:20:51,712 --> 01:20:52,992
But much display

1502
01:20:53,760 --> 01:20:56,320
Because his website

1503
01:20:56,832 --> 01:20:58,112
Is one of the most

1504
01:20:58,624 --> 01:20:59,136
Traffic

1505
01:20:59,904 --> 01:21:02,208
Internet news aggregators in the world

1506
01:21:02,464 --> 01:21:04,256
One of the problems of it

1507
01:21:04,512 --> 01:21:05,280
Is that

1508
01:21:06,048 --> 01:21:06,816
He is a

1509
01:21:07,328 --> 01:21:08,096
Partisan hack

1510
01:21:08,608 --> 01:21:09,376
He is a

1511
01:21:09,632 --> 01:21:10,400
Super

1512
01:21:10,656 --> 01:21:12,192
Conservative dill weed

1513
01:21:12,448 --> 01:21:15,264
Publishers are not

1514
01:21:16,288 --> 01:21:17,824
A lot of them have

1515
01:21:18,336 --> 01:21:19,104
Let's say

1516
01:21:19,616 --> 01:21:21,920
He was big on that Swiss boat

1517
01:21:22,176 --> 01:21:22,944
For truth

1518
01:21:23,200 --> 01:21:24,480
Situation with Carrie

1519
01:21:24,992 --> 01:21:26,784
I'll be on that I'm either

1520
01:21:27,040 --> 01:21:29,344
You just everything anything anti-hillary

1521
01:21:29,600 --> 01:21:30,880
Everything anti-clinton

1522
01:21:31,136 --> 01:21:33,184
He's been a huge part of because

1523
01:21:33,440 --> 01:21:34,464
He came to prominence

1524
01:21:34,976 --> 01:21:37,536
As one of the first people reporting to Monica Lewinsky

1525
01:21:38,816 --> 01:21:39,328
With Oakland

1526
01:21:39,840 --> 01:21:40,864
That's why he broke

1527
01:21:41,120 --> 01:21:41,632
International,

1528
01:21:42,656 --> 01:21:43,680
But before that

1529
01:21:44,192 --> 01:21:44,704
He was just

1530
01:21:44,960 --> 01:21:46,240
A guy who ran a gossip

1531
01:21:47,008 --> 01:21:49,568
The Drudge Report was just a gossip site

1532
01:21:50,080 --> 01:21:50,848
And that

1533
01:21:51,104 --> 01:21:51,616
Ethos

1534
01:21:52,128 --> 01:21:53,152
Still Remains

1535
01:21:53,408 --> 01:21:54,432
Even though he's

1536
01:21:54,944 --> 01:21:56,480
Supposedly a hard news

1537
01:21:56,736 --> 01:21:58,272
Breaking reports kind

1538
01:21:59,552 --> 01:22:01,344
It's still a gossip rag

1539
01:22:01,856 --> 01:22:03,392
But for very serious issue

1540
01:22:03,904 --> 01:22:06,464
We've seen it brought up over Court Daily Mail

1541
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:09,024
Cuz a lot of

1542
01:22:09,280 --> 01:22:10,048
Bulshit

1543
01:22:14,656 --> 01:22:16,192
Drudge Report

1544
01:22:16,448 --> 01:22:17,216
That doesn't help

1545
01:22:21,568 --> 01:22:22,336
Play some nice pop ups

1546
01:22:23,616 --> 01:22:24,384
Little Ted every now and again

1547
01:22:24,640 --> 01:22:28,992
When we went over the dentist Montgomery investigation

1548
01:22:29,248 --> 01:22:31,040
About how much b******* that was

1549
01:22:32,064 --> 01:22:34,624
Alex being excited The Drudge was reporting

1550
01:22:36,672 --> 01:22:37,696
Not

1551
01:22:37,952 --> 01:22:41,536
True so there's one example just from our history

1552
01:22:41,792 --> 01:22:43,072
Of him by shooting the bad

1553
01:22:43,584 --> 01:22:46,656
Also you super big into it has been

1554
01:22:46,912 --> 01:22:48,192
Super baked into the birther

1555
01:22:48,448 --> 01:22:49,472
Situation

1556
01:22:49,728 --> 01:22:55,360
Upholstered for Joe Arpaio with his birth certificate

1557
01:22:55,872 --> 01:22:57,408
No just some of the examples of

1558
01:22:57,664 --> 01:22:59,712
Horrible things that use perpetuate

1559
01:22:59,968 --> 01:23:00,736
Joe Arpaio

1560
01:23:00,992 --> 01:23:01,760
Should be on.

1561
01:23:05,088 --> 01:23:06,368
Also

1562
01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:09,184
They're pushed me Hillary is sick

1563
01:23:09,440 --> 01:23:10,720
Narrative really hard

1564
01:23:10,976 --> 01:23:12,512
He also pushed the

1565
01:23:13,536 --> 01:23:16,608
Bill Clinton's love child story it's gossip

1566
01:23:19,168 --> 01:23:21,216
Except your say and what have you

1567
01:23:26,080 --> 01:23:27,872
And I'll say that this first

1568
01:23:28,128 --> 01:23:29,920
Clip is about

1569
01:23:30,176 --> 01:23:31,456
The only piece of it

1570
01:23:31,968 --> 01:23:32,992
That could be

1571
01:23:33,248 --> 01:23:34,272
Construed as real

1572
01:23:35,040 --> 01:23:35,552
And it's not

1573
01:23:36,064 --> 01:23:41,184
Husband and wife

1574
01:23:41,440 --> 01:23:46,048
They were going to ban words

1575
01:23:46,304 --> 01:23:52,448
Has the left have they gone collectively insane on on a

1576
01:23:52,704 --> 01:23:53,216
Kontrolfreek

1577
01:23:53,472 --> 01:23:59,616
Bentley

1578
01:23:59,872 --> 01:24:02,944
Supreme Court Justice over for me

1579
01:24:03,968 --> 01:24:05,504
Which one are you

1580
01:24:05,760 --> 01:24:08,832
They've got the votes copyright law out of there

1581
01:24:09,344 --> 01:24:11,904
They're going to make it so headlines

1582
01:24:12,160 --> 01:24:14,464
Was it Kennedy Court Justice

1583
01:24:15,232 --> 01:24:16,768
To my face that it's over

1584
01:24:17,280 --> 01:24:22,400
They got the boat, which means forever

1585
01:24:22,912 --> 01:24:26,496
How many more moons does sun rises BBC in real life

1586
01:24:26,752 --> 01:24:30,848
Horizon soil amount

1587
01:24:31,104 --> 01:24:37,248
People to be saying with his attitude I'll get on with my life in my greatness

1588
01:24:37,504 --> 01:24:43,648
No you can't

1589
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:54,144
They're claiming you're taking their words this is insane and you had the Justice Stephen Breyer said we need to look at it

1590
01:25:02,080 --> 01:25:06,944
He thought some of these other decisions

1591
01:25:07,200 --> 01:25:08,480
And the Supreme Court

1592
01:25:08,992 --> 01:25:14,624
Decides you cannot have a website with news headlines linking across-the-board

1593
01:25:14,880 --> 01:25:18,464
Was it Ruth Bader Ginsburg Alex accidentally

1594
01:25:18,720 --> 01:25:21,024
Like nine months a year after this

1595
01:25:21,536 --> 01:25:24,096
He's like the conservative one

1596
01:25:24,352 --> 01:25:25,632
On an item not saying it's

1597
01:25:25,888 --> 01:25:28,192
Scalia

1598
01:25:29,472 --> 01:25:30,240
Hello

1599
01:25:30,752 --> 01:25:31,264
Clarence.

1600
01:25:36,128 --> 01:25:36,896
So I

1601
01:25:37,152 --> 01:25:37,920
That's all.

1602
01:25:38,432 --> 01:25:39,712
I mean ice

1603
01:25:41,504 --> 01:25:42,272
At this point

1604
01:25:42,528 --> 01:25:46,112
I mean right now I'm asking that because I I'm afraid of

1605
01:25:46,624 --> 01:25:48,416
F****** zombies I watch Game of Thrones earlier

1606
01:25:48,672 --> 01:25:49,184
We should check

1607
01:25:53,536 --> 01:25:55,072
I think I think what

1608
01:25:55,328 --> 01:25:56,352
Maybe

1609
01:25:57,888 --> 01:25:58,912
A Supreme Court Justice

1610
01:25:59,168 --> 01:25:59,680
Was telling Drudge

1611
01:26:00,448 --> 01:26:01,472
What you do is done

1612
01:26:02,240 --> 01:26:04,544
Inasmuch as

1613
01:26:05,056 --> 01:26:07,872
Call you can't take headline

1614
01:26:09,664 --> 01:26:10,944
What you traffic in

1615
01:26:11,200 --> 01:26:12,480
Is lying about story

1616
01:26:13,760 --> 01:26:17,344
Lake George is really good and it gets a lot of traffic because

1617
01:26:17,600 --> 01:26:18,880
Chico's me fine stories

1618
01:26:19,136 --> 01:26:21,440
I meant put the manipulative headlines on the link

1619
01:26:23,488 --> 01:26:24,512
Boost traffic to the

1620
01:26:24,768 --> 01:26:25,280
Two places

1621
01:26:26,816 --> 01:26:32,960
Right and it makes it makes for inability to control it because a lot of the time people don't follow the links

1622
01:26:33,216 --> 01:26:35,264
Read the stories

1623
01:26:35,520 --> 01:26:37,568
And because he misrepresented

1624
01:26:37,824 --> 01:26:39,360
I'm so happy

1625
01:26:39,616 --> 01:26:42,944
And sometimes it's not outright statements it's the you know

1626
01:26:43,200 --> 01:26:44,480
Statement?

1627
01:26:44,736 --> 01:26:45,760
We can get around that

1628
01:26:49,856 --> 01:26:51,136
Is it the case that

1629
01:26:51,392 --> 01:26:53,696
Wonder Alex loves him so much that

1630
01:26:53,952 --> 01:26:57,280
Alex's ammo right there

1631
01:26:58,048 --> 01:26:59,840
I mean Alex Jones came up with

1632
01:27:00,864 --> 01:27:03,424
He came up on drug

1633
01:27:03,936 --> 01:27:05,472
Like drudge has been doing this for

1634
01:27:05,728 --> 01:27:08,032
For twenty years as long as Alex has been broadcasting

1635
01:27:08,544 --> 01:27:10,336
So it's always been

1636
01:27:10,848 --> 01:27:12,128
Of Alex's awareness

1637
01:27:12,640 --> 01:27:14,176
It's always been a piece of wood

1638
01:27:14,432 --> 01:27:15,200
His

1639
01:27:15,968 --> 01:27:17,504
What he respects in journalism

1640
01:27:17,760 --> 01:27:19,296
If the same way that Andrew

1641
01:27:19,808 --> 01:27:21,344
Will Andrew Breitbart

1642
01:27:21,856 --> 01:27:25,952
Before he ever started Breitbart

1643
01:27:26,464 --> 01:27:30,048
All of this stuff really links back

1644
01:27:30,304 --> 01:27:30,816
To Drudge

1645
01:27:31,072 --> 01:27:33,888
And his willful misleading people

1646
01:27:34,144 --> 01:27:34,656
With

1647
01:27:35,168 --> 01:27:37,216
And I would say I don't either

1648
01:27:37,472 --> 01:27:38,496
Talk to Clarence Thomas

1649
01:27:39,008 --> 01:27:41,568
So I don't know what he actually said to Drudge

1650
01:27:41,824 --> 01:27:45,408
And what drug is misrepresenting but I'm guessing the

1651
01:27:45,664 --> 01:27:47,968
People's intellectual property will be protected

1652
01:27:48,224 --> 01:27:49,504
In a better way

1653
01:27:49,760 --> 01:27:50,784
Then what you do with it

1654
01:27:51,040 --> 01:27:52,576
You will be able to be sued

1655
01:27:52,832 --> 01:27:53,344
Ford

1656
01:27:53,600 --> 01:27:55,136
Manipulating people like this

1657
01:27:55,648 --> 01:27:57,952
I'm not too worried about that

1658
01:27:58,464 --> 01:28:00,000
Cuz I don't want people doing stuff like

1659
01:28:01,024 --> 01:28:02,304
It's freedom of speech

1660
01:28:02,560 --> 01:28:03,584
But at the same time

1661
01:28:04,352 --> 01:28:04,864
Propaganda

1662
01:28:05,376 --> 01:28:07,936
Yeah I'm very against propaganda because

1663
01:28:08,192 --> 01:28:09,216
We seen the effects of

1664
01:28:11,776 --> 01:28:12,800
Just a rule like hey

1665
01:28:13,568 --> 01:28:14,592
If their headline is this

1666
01:28:15,616 --> 01:28:16,640
Splinter with their head

1667
01:28:16,896 --> 01:28:17,408
Bright

1668
01:28:17,664 --> 01:28:18,176
That's it

1669
01:28:18,432 --> 01:28:19,712
All that all that because that's

1670
01:28:19,968 --> 01:28:21,760
Exactly what salve

1671
01:28:22,016 --> 01:28:22,528
What time is this

1672
01:28:23,296 --> 01:28:24,576
This willingness of

1673
01:28:24,832 --> 01:28:25,344
People

1674
01:28:26,368 --> 01:28:27,648
To just read a headline and then

1675
01:28:28,416 --> 01:28:31,232
Just like Alex saying

1676
01:28:33,536 --> 01:28:35,840
You're plenty of time pre-show

1677
01:28:39,680 --> 01:28:42,240
I'm only a broadcast

1678
01:28:42,496 --> 01:28:43,264
You're talking about it on there

1679
01:28:43,520 --> 01:28:47,104
Kill Everybody

1680
01:28:48,384 --> 01:28:54,272
Crazy at 9 to 5 job and I read more of it than he did

1681
01:28:57,856 --> 01:28:58,880
Write any predates

1682
01:28:59,136 --> 01:29:00,672
Well yeah I know

1683
01:29:01,952 --> 01:29:04,256
Just

1684
01:29:05,024 --> 01:29:05,536
Okay

1685
01:29:05,792 --> 01:29:09,120
I want to make sure that work

1686
01:29:09,376 --> 01:29:11,168
The reference that are

1687
01:29:12,704 --> 01:29:15,520
The thing I want to drive home though is that

1688
01:29:17,568 --> 01:29:19,616
George is really the

1689
01:29:19,872 --> 01:29:20,384
The central

1690
01:29:20,640 --> 01:29:22,432
Spoke in many ways of this week

1691
01:29:23,200 --> 01:29:23,968
Because

1692
01:29:24,736 --> 01:29:26,016
His his

1693
01:29:27,040 --> 01:29:29,344
His Empire and is important

1694
01:29:29,600 --> 01:29:30,880
It's the culture have really run

1695
01:29:31,136 --> 01:29:33,952
Concurrent paths with Alex Jones Infowars

1696
01:29:34,464 --> 01:29:36,768
He's he's been more successful he's much bigger than our

1697
01:29:39,840 --> 01:29:41,120
No their contemporaries

1698
01:29:41,632 --> 01:29:43,168
Time they have run

1699
01:29:43,424 --> 01:29:44,704
Similar paths

1700
01:29:45,216 --> 01:29:46,240
Same place as Trump

1701
01:29:47,264 --> 01:29:48,800
At the same time Breitbart

1702
01:29:49,824 --> 01:29:51,872
The publication

1703
01:29:52,128 --> 01:29:53,408
Are direct offshoot

1704
01:29:54,432 --> 01:29:55,456
Bright garage

1705
01:29:55,968 --> 01:29:56,480
Android

1706
01:29:56,736 --> 01:29:59,296
Consistently linked to them which gave them

1707
01:29:59,552 --> 01:30:01,088
The platform and the audience

1708
01:30:01,600 --> 01:30:02,880
But they never would have had otherwise

1709
01:30:04,416 --> 01:30:09,024
He is responsible for mainstreaming and creating and popularizing

1710
01:30:09,536 --> 01:30:11,328
So much of this dangerous

1711
01:30:11,840 --> 01:30:12,864
Why based

1712
01:30:13,376 --> 01:30:14,656
Right-wing media

1713
01:30:15,424 --> 01:30:16,192
And beyond that

1714
01:30:16,960 --> 01:30:17,728
He's created

1715
01:30:17,984 --> 01:30:18,496
An Atmos

1716
01:30:18,752 --> 01:30:20,800
Sphere where everyone knows

1717
01:30:21,056 --> 01:30:23,360
Baby if you get on drugs

1718
01:30:23,616 --> 01:30:25,152
It brings you massive trap

1719
01:30:25,920 --> 01:30:28,224
So a lot of people have tailored their approach

1720
01:30:28,480 --> 01:30:28,992
In order to

1721
01:30:29,248 --> 01:30:30,784
To try and get linked on drugs

1722
01:30:31,296 --> 01:30:31,808
Which

1723
01:30:32,064 --> 01:30:34,112
Don't f****** keep yourself for a second

1724
01:30:34,368 --> 01:30:35,648
If that hasn't informed

1725
01:30:36,160 --> 01:30:36,672
How

1726
01:30:36,928 --> 01:30:38,720
Mike cernovich goes about his business

1727
01:30:38,976 --> 01:30:41,024
Power jack the Soviet goes about his business

1728
01:30:41,536 --> 01:30:42,048
They want

1729
01:30:42,304 --> 01:30:44,352
Create things that drudge will linked to

1730
01:30:44,608 --> 01:30:45,120
As opposed

1731
01:30:45,376 --> 01:30:46,912
To creating things that are true

1732
01:30:47,168 --> 01:30:49,728
Because they know there's a massive upside in it

1733
01:30:50,496 --> 01:30:53,056
And don't think for a f****** second The Drudge doesn't know that

1734
01:30:54,336 --> 01:30:56,640
It's all it's all a f******

1735
01:30:57,152 --> 01:30:58,688
Manipulation

1736
01:30:58,944 --> 01:30:59,968
Media game

1737
01:31:00,224 --> 01:31:01,760
That drug is making millions

1738
01:31:02,528 --> 01:31:04,064
Because all he has to do

1739
01:31:04,320 --> 01:31:05,344
Please keep upkeep

1740
01:31:05,600 --> 01:31:09,440
On his very shoddy site where all you have to do is sit down

1741
01:31:09,696 --> 01:31:12,768
And write write a note 20 headlines a day that are salacious

1742
01:31:13,280 --> 01:31:16,096
4 / the news find things you can misrepresent

1743
01:31:16,352 --> 01:31:17,120
You're done

1744
01:31:17,376 --> 01:31:17,888
He doesn't do

1745
01:31:18,144 --> 01:31:18,656
Do that personally

1746
01:31:19,424 --> 01:31:24,032
I don't know what it looks like now but like they've there was a piece I read for my 2011

1747
01:31:24,288 --> 01:31:25,824
Him and another dude

1748
01:31:26,848 --> 01:31:30,688
Wow yeah because it is the simplest thing in the world to do

1749
01:31:30,944 --> 01:31:33,248
Right and I mean he's his it's not like he's

1750
01:31:33,504 --> 01:31:34,272
He's putting a lot of grass

1751
01:31:34,528 --> 01:31:35,552
Design people to work on

1752
01:31:35,808 --> 01:31:40,160
I'm saying negative things about him because I take you to s*******

1753
01:31:40,416 --> 01:31:44,768
But at the same time in the same way that I say Alex Jones is a good broadcaster

1754
01:31:45,024 --> 01:31:45,792
I want to see

1755
01:31:46,304 --> 01:31:46,816
Grudges

1756
01:31:47,072 --> 01:31:47,840
Brilliant

1757
01:31:48,608 --> 01:31:49,632
Brilliant guy

1758
01:31:49,888 --> 01:31:52,448
In terms of picking the stories and presenting

1759
01:31:54,496 --> 01:31:56,544
Eat the pudding is in the eating

1760
01:31:56,800 --> 01:31:57,312
The fact that

1761
01:31:57,568 --> 01:31:59,872
Millions of people go to his website

1762
01:32:00,128 --> 01:32:01,152
Everyday

1763
01:32:02,432 --> 01:32:04,992
You can't do that if you're not really good

1764
01:32:05,248 --> 01:32:07,296
After I believe the term

1765
01:32:07,552 --> 01:32:11,136
But I saw some on right that I was he's the best wire editor in the world

1766
01:32:11,648 --> 01:32:13,952
Oh yeah that's great that's a great line

1767
01:32:15,744 --> 01:32:16,768
Curator of

1768
01:32:17,024 --> 01:32:19,072
Things in order to make a specific point

1769
01:32:19,328 --> 01:32:21,376
But the point isn't necessarily real

1770
01:32:21,632 --> 01:32:22,912
He's had to redact so many fun

1771
01:32:23,168 --> 01:32:23,936
Walking things in the past

1772
01:32:24,192 --> 01:32:25,984
He's let people down horrible pad

1773
01:32:27,520 --> 01:32:28,032
Create

1774
01:32:28,288 --> 01:32:30,080
The he's created a lot of that

1775
01:32:32,128 --> 01:32:33,152
He's definitely Amplified

1776
01:32:33,408 --> 01:32:34,432
That to a level that

1777
01:32:35,968 --> 01:32:39,808
If you have somebody who's your Protege go create a site that explains

1778
01:32:40,064 --> 01:32:40,832
With Italy makes

1779
01:32:41,344 --> 01:32:41,856
Right wing

1780
01:32:42,368 --> 01:32:43,136
Propaganda

1781
01:32:44,672 --> 01:32:45,440
Italy link to it

1782
01:32:46,464 --> 01:32:47,488
To get them more trap

1783
01:32:48,256 --> 01:32:50,816
You're a Yeezys like this weird conservative

1784
01:32:51,072 --> 01:32:52,608
Kingmaker

1785
01:32:52,864 --> 01:32:53,632
It's in the same way that

1786
01:32:54,144 --> 01:32:54,656
Those

1787
01:32:55,168 --> 01:32:56,448
Energy

1788
01:32:56,704 --> 01:32:57,728
Anyting where the Fox News

1789
01:32:57,984 --> 01:32:58,496
People

1790
01:32:58,752 --> 01:33:00,800
Rodger Ailes

1791
01:33:01,056 --> 01:33:03,616
The same thing is true of the drug

1792
01:33:04,640 --> 01:33:06,432
You like what you were saying about the Drudge Report

1793
01:33:06,688 --> 01:33:07,712
And like like Breitbart

1794
01:33:07,968 --> 01:33:10,528
Created Breitbart while still working with drugs

1795
01:33:10,784 --> 01:33:11,552
So the whole thing is

1796
01:33:11,808 --> 01:33:13,344
Feedback loop

1797
01:33:13,600 --> 01:33:16,416
That's exact same thing with the game that Alex Jones plays Lester

1798
01:33:16,672 --> 01:33:17,184
Successfully

1799
01:33:17,440 --> 01:33:21,280
With sending Mark Dice out to make a video and then reporting on that video

1800
01:33:21,536 --> 01:33:23,584
So it is all just

1801
01:33:25,376 --> 01:33:27,680
Miss representation of Truth and fact

1802
01:33:28,192 --> 01:33:29,728
For specific goal

1803
01:33:29,984 --> 01:33:32,288
Specifically

1804
01:33:32,800 --> 01:33:33,312
Big picture

1805
01:33:34,336 --> 01:33:35,360
Destruction of reality is

1806
01:33:36,128 --> 01:33:37,920
Well that's it that's by-product of it

1807
01:33:38,176 --> 01:33:39,200
But the destruction of the

1808
01:33:40,480 --> 01:33:42,784
It really seems like that's what he's mostly about

1809
01:33:44,576 --> 01:33:46,112
Say really really really hate

1810
01:33:48,416 --> 01:33:51,488
And I think a part of that is I mean I don't want to bring it down to some like

1811
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:54,560
You're a misogynist if you don't like Hillary but

1812
01:33:55,072 --> 01:33:56,096
I generally

1813
01:33:56,352 --> 01:33:57,376
Do you think that

1814
01:33:57,632 --> 01:33:58,400
Especially back in

1815
01:33:58,656 --> 01:33:59,168
In the days

1816
01:33:59,424 --> 01:34:00,192
When bill was

1817
01:34:01,216 --> 01:34:04,800
There were there was a lot of hatred of Hillary that was just

1818
01:34:05,312 --> 01:34:09,152
She's the first lady can't you just get a nice dress on and go to a party

1819
01:34:09,408 --> 01:34:11,456
The fact that she actually had an agenda

1820
01:34:11,968 --> 01:34:12,480
I mean

1821
01:34:12,736 --> 01:34:13,760
Not that other path

1822
01:34:14,016 --> 01:34:14,784
First ladies hats

1823
01:34:15,040 --> 01:34:15,552
But

1824
01:34:16,576 --> 01:34:18,112
She was very vocal

1825
01:34:18,368 --> 01:34:20,672
Choose forceful about her opinion

1826
01:34:21,184 --> 01:34:22,720
Easy target for the

1827
01:34:23,232 --> 01:34:24,768
F****** monsters in the

1828
01:34:25,024 --> 01:34:26,304
It's like Newt Gingrich in those

1829
01:34:26,816 --> 01:34:29,120
Yeah and I think that a lot of the hatred

1830
01:34:29,376 --> 01:34:30,912
Come through that and

1831
01:34:31,168 --> 01:34:32,192
From internalized

1832
01:34:32,448 --> 01:34:33,984
Misogyny where people are like

1833
01:34:34,240 --> 01:34:34,752
Hey

1834
01:34:35,008 --> 01:34:37,312
You just let your your husband go bang all the

1835
01:34:37,568 --> 01:34:38,848
These people you're a weak woman

1836
01:34:39,360 --> 01:34:40,128
It sort of s***

1837
01:34:40,384 --> 01:34:46,528
And I think the Judge is a victim of that mentality along with the lies that we've already shown Larry

1838
01:34:46,784 --> 01:34:47,296
Nichols Towing

1839
01:34:47,808 --> 01:34:50,624
Like all this is in the same ecosystem

1840
01:34:50,880 --> 01:34:52,416
Really really f***** up

1841
01:34:52,672 --> 01:34:53,952
That all of these people

1842
01:34:54,464 --> 01:34:57,024
Are so connected and it's so clear

1843
01:34:57,280 --> 01:34:58,048
What they're doing

1844
01:34:58,816 --> 01:35:00,352
So let's get to this next clip

1845
01:35:01,120 --> 01:35:02,400
With a Drudge

1846
01:35:03,168 --> 01:35:04,192
You know what

1847
01:35:05,216 --> 01:35:05,984
Beggars of thought

1848
01:35:08,288 --> 01:35:08,800
They don't

1849
01:35:09,056 --> 01:35:10,080
I have any ideas

1850
01:35:14,432 --> 01:35:16,224
Is trying to

1851
01:35:16,480 --> 01:35:16,992
Kingsdown

1852
01:35:17,248 --> 01:35:19,296
Like Trump isn't doing anything

1853
01:35:20,576 --> 01:35:22,368
He's just tearing down everything that Obama

1854
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:28,768
Progressive tax

1855
01:35:29,536 --> 01:35:30,304
Is something that they're just

1856
01:35:30,560 --> 01:35:31,072
Continuing to

1857
01:35:31,328 --> 01:35:32,352
Teardown

1858
01:35:32,608 --> 01:35:33,376
What fer

1859
01:35:34,656 --> 01:35:35,424
These guys

1860
01:35:36,448 --> 01:35:37,216
What Nixon

1861
01:35:37,728 --> 01:35:38,240
Really

1862
01:35:44,128 --> 01:35:44,896
Is there anything

1863
01:35:45,152 --> 01:35:45,664
Things that they

1864
01:35:45,920 --> 01:35:46,432
Built

1865
01:35:46,944 --> 01:35:53,088
Like Network that's impressive

1866
01:35:53,344 --> 01:35:55,904
Ethics and consequences out of it it's pretty impressive

1867
01:35:57,440 --> 01:35:58,208
No I don't know

1868
01:35:58,464 --> 01:35:58,976
I don't know

1869
01:35:59,232 --> 01:36:00,256
Just like in argiope

1870
01:36:00,512 --> 01:36:01,792
Government

1871
01:36:02,048 --> 01:36:02,560
Nothing ever come up

1872
01:36:03,584 --> 01:36:04,864
It seems like everything always

1873
01:36:05,120 --> 01:36:05,632
Just goes down for

1874
01:36:06,400 --> 01:36:07,168
Or backwards

1875
01:36:07,680 --> 01:36:08,192
Yeah

1876
01:36:09,216 --> 01:36:13,312
I don't know I can't think of anything right now there's probably something somewhere but who cares

1877
01:36:13,568 --> 01:36:15,360
Next clip we get to

1878
01:36:15,616 --> 01:36:16,640
To see what

1879
01:36:17,152 --> 01:36:17,664
What drugs

1880
01:36:17,920 --> 01:36:18,688
Facts about the candidates

1881
01:36:21,504 --> 01:36:25,856
Is drag

1882
01:36:31,488 --> 01:36:33,280
Any form of success

1883
01:36:33,792 --> 01:36:35,840
In the pole is because they

1884
01:36:36,352 --> 01:36:39,680
I don't know I'm very pessimistic

1885
01:36:39,936 --> 01:36:44,544
I'm very pessimistic

1886
01:36:44,800 --> 01:36:46,080
With the dreaded brain

1887
01:36:46,336 --> 01:36:49,920
In the in the jar in the Oval Office once known as Hillary Clinton

1888
01:36:50,432 --> 01:36:51,712
Who is hypothyroid

1889
01:36:51,968 --> 01:36:56,320
Anybody who is 17 years old who is hypothyroid

1890
01:36:56,576 --> 01:36:58,112
Ladies and gentlemen

1891
01:36:58,624 --> 01:37:04,768
Do it has to be her VP is whether it's Antonio or the other

1892
01:37:05,024 --> 01:37:08,096
San Antonio for the other Castro from San Antonio

1893
01:37:11,424 --> 01:37:15,776
After seeing NDC giving her a Time

1894
01:37:16,800 --> 01:37:19,360
Hillary's back

1895
01:37:19,872 --> 01:37:20,896
And she's back for real

1896
01:37:21,408 --> 01:37:26,528
Means to you or me what it means to me I got a long history with these people

1897
01:37:26,784 --> 01:37:32,928
They play dirty

1898
01:37:34,208 --> 01:37:35,232
A civil action

1899
01:37:35,488 --> 01:37:37,280
Thought that's very misrepresented

1900
01:37:39,328 --> 01:37:45,216
In 1997 The Drudge Report reported that incoming White House assistant Sidney Blumenthal beat his wife

1901
01:37:45,472 --> 01:37:46,496
And was covering it up

1902
01:37:47,776 --> 01:37:50,848
Read the story the next day and apologized saying that he was given bad information

1903
01:37:51,104 --> 01:37:54,688
But Blumenthal filed a 30 million-dollar libel lawsuit against Drudge

1904
01:37:55,200 --> 01:38:00,064
After four years Blumenthal drop the lawsuit saying that the suit of costing tens of thousands of dollars in legal

1905
01:38:00,832 --> 01:38:04,416
He agreed to pay $2,500 to drudges Los Angeles attorney

1906
01:38:04,672 --> 01:38:05,440
Foretravel cost

1907
01:38:05,952 --> 01:38:07,488
Claiming The Drudge was quote back

1908
01:38:07,744 --> 01:38:08,768
Unlimited fun

1909
01:38:09,024 --> 01:38:09,792
From political supporters

1910
01:38:10,048 --> 01:38:11,840
Who use tax-exempt Foundation

1911
01:38:12,608 --> 01:38:16,192
The individual rights Foundation led by conservative activist David Horowitz

1912
01:38:16,704 --> 01:38:19,008
Paid drug is legal fees in the Blumenthal author

1913
01:38:19,776 --> 01:38:21,312
A federal judge noted in the judgment

1914
01:38:21,568 --> 01:38:22,592
The drudges quote

1915
01:38:22,848 --> 01:38:25,664
I'm not a reporter a journalist or a news gatherer

1916
01:38:25,920 --> 01:38:28,992
He is as he admits himself simply a purveyor of God

1917
01:38:29,760 --> 01:38:30,272
So

1918
01:38:30,528 --> 01:38:36,160
Even though there was a bad outcome to that suit and terms of you didn't actually get pain for libel

1919
01:38:36,672 --> 01:38:37,696
Is a purveyor of God

1920
01:38:37,952 --> 01:38:40,000
Yes

1921
01:38:41,280 --> 01:38:41,792
Is legally

1922
01:38:43,584 --> 01:38:46,912
Clinton suing him

1923
01:38:47,936 --> 01:38:49,984
I think you wanted to say that thing about the Supreme Court

1924
01:38:50,240 --> 01:38:51,008
I think that's about it

1925
01:38:51,264 --> 01:38:52,288
Etiquette mostly at

1926
01:38:52,800 --> 01:38:54,336
Like just showed up

1927
01:38:56,128 --> 01:38:58,688
He's just doing a drop in 5 minutes like what's going on

1928
01:38:58,944 --> 01:39:03,296
No I think there was something else going on in Austin at the time something by conference or something I don't know

1929
01:39:03,808 --> 01:39:09,440
I'm not entirely sure

1930
01:39:10,976 --> 01:39:11,744
Michael Savage

1931
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:13,280
The show around that time

1932
01:39:13,536 --> 01:39:15,840
I think he's just trying to get to

1933
01:39:16,096 --> 01:39:17,120
Get stories out

1934
01:39:17,376 --> 01:39:18,656
To demonize people

1935
01:39:18,912 --> 01:39:21,216
And scare people into falling in line with the right

1936
01:39:21,728 --> 01:39:22,496
Hypothyroid

1937
01:39:24,544 --> 01:39:27,360
Brain in a jar

1938
01:39:27,616 --> 01:39:31,968
It's not even scary as his lies about the Supreme Court

1939
01:39:33,504 --> 01:39:35,296
Isn't that a fish song

1940
01:39:37,088 --> 01:39:39,136
I was thinking more Futurama

1941
01:39:39,392 --> 01:39:40,928
I was going to I was going I'm happy with

1942
01:39:41,184 --> 01:39:41,952
The president

1943
01:39:42,464 --> 01:39:44,256
If Nixon can come back to become

1944
01:39:44,768 --> 01:39:46,304
Futurama I think Hillary has a shot

1945
01:39:49,888 --> 01:39:50,656
Meant to scare

1946
01:39:50,912 --> 01:39:52,960
Conservatives is the idea that the

1947
01:39:53,216 --> 01:39:53,728
The out of

1948
01:39:53,984 --> 01:39:58,080
Control liberal Supreme Court is going to Outlaw even the ability to

1949
01:39:58,336 --> 01:39:59,360
To publish a headline

1950
01:39:59,872 --> 01:40:01,152
It's all part of this

1951
01:40:01,408 --> 01:40:02,944
Internationalism

1952
01:40:03,712 --> 01:40:06,272
He's walking on the globalist ip2

1953
01:40:06,784 --> 01:40:10,112
Like for real

1954
01:40:10,368 --> 01:40:12,416
He spends about 5 minutes of this time

1955
01:40:12,672 --> 01:40:13,440
But he's on

1956
01:40:13,696 --> 01:40:15,488
Just being like Alex you are the best

1957
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:16,768
I love you

1958
01:40:17,024 --> 01:40:18,048
You get it

1959
01:40:18,560 --> 01:40:19,328
Yeah of course he's on

1960
01:40:19,584 --> 01:40:20,096
Globalist

1961
01:40:20,608 --> 01:40:21,120
But you asked

1962
01:40:21,376 --> 01:40:22,144
The beginning of the clip

1963
01:40:22,400 --> 01:40:23,936
Is he on Trump and no he's not

1964
01:40:24,192 --> 01:40:24,704
This point

1965
01:40:24,960 --> 01:40:27,776
Or at least he's not expressing that on Alex's show

1966
01:40:28,544 --> 01:40:32,896
I don't think I don't think the marching orders have been given out clearly from Russia

1967
01:40:33,408 --> 01:40:35,200
For all these people to fall in line

1968
01:40:35,456 --> 01:40:35,968
And sports

1969
01:40:37,504 --> 01:40:39,296
That's kind of depends what I'm getting at this

1970
01:40:39,552 --> 01:40:40,064
Pretty much

1971
01:40:40,320 --> 01:40:41,344
And we get like

1972
01:40:41,856 --> 01:40:43,136
We just saw today

1973
01:40:43,392 --> 01:40:45,184
Daily Stormer got taken offline

1974
01:40:45,440 --> 01:40:49,024
Apricot hacked by anonymous

1975
01:40:49,280 --> 01:40:50,816
What a shock

1976
01:40:52,864 --> 01:40:53,376
Yeah

1977
01:40:53,888 --> 01:40:54,912
Russians really love suck

1978
01:40:55,680 --> 01:41:01,824
It goes back to that stuff that we were talking about when we went over the interview book that he put out the talked about

1979
01:41:02,080 --> 01:41:04,384
The way to subvert a country

1980
01:41:04,896 --> 01:41:07,968
Especially America is to support any Fringe

1981
01:41:08,224 --> 01:41:09,760
Groups specially racist

1982
01:41:10,016 --> 01:41:10,528
Extremist

1983
01:41:10,784 --> 01:41:12,576
And that's clearly what's being done

1984
01:41:13,344 --> 01:41:14,112
Bucking obvious

1985
01:41:14,368 --> 01:41:14,880
I'll be

1986
01:41:15,136 --> 01:41:16,160
All these assholes

1987
01:41:16,928 --> 01:41:20,000
They were they were primed for it of their own volition

1988
01:41:20,256 --> 01:41:21,792
I'm not saying that it's in trap

1989
01:41:22,048 --> 01:41:24,864
Matter anything like that I don't think that Russia made them do something

1990
01:41:25,120 --> 01:41:29,472
They didn't want to do or blackmailed them or anything like that they were already ready

1991
01:41:29,728 --> 01:41:31,520
Need to do it and they got tricked

1992
01:41:32,032 --> 01:41:35,872
Tricked by Propaganda cuz they're propagandist

1993
01:41:36,128 --> 01:41:38,432
Comes out

1994
01:41:38,688 --> 01:41:39,456
The truth and so

1995
01:41:39,968 --> 01:41:40,736
Anybody who agrees with

1996
01:41:44,064 --> 01:41:45,088
There's an added piece to it

1997
01:41:45,600 --> 01:41:51,232
That's how you move a propagandist in the direction you want them to go by adding ly

1998
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:54,816
Absolutely so here is another

1999
01:41:55,072 --> 01:41:56,352
Here's the other thing

2000
01:41:56,608 --> 01:41:58,400
That I think garage was there to do

2001
01:41:58,656 --> 01:42:01,472
Is there scare people

2002
01:42:02,240 --> 01:42:03,264
So why this next

2003
01:42:03,776 --> 01:42:05,056
Is really weird

2004
01:42:05,312 --> 01:42:07,104
There's so much going on world

2005
01:42:07,360 --> 01:42:11,200
Obama now is talking about Australia

2006
01:42:15,296 --> 01:42:17,856
As pundits to say let's just take him

2007
01:42:21,696 --> 01:42:24,256
If they really come out in the frontal assault on Gunn

2008
01:42:24,512 --> 01:42:27,072
It means I think they're trying to start a civil war

2009
01:42:27,840 --> 01:42:30,144
It just seems like insanity I mean they may

2010
01:42:32,960 --> 01:42:37,824
Well cuz they're all armed

2011
01:42:38,080 --> 01:42:43,968
Themselves they don't have to worry about challenge Hillary Secret Service

2012
01:42:46,272 --> 01:42:48,832
Your secret service dismiss them

2013
01:42:49,088 --> 01:42:50,624
Security around you

2014
01:42:50,880 --> 01:42:53,440
Hillary

2015
01:42:53,952 --> 01:42:55,744
I dare you

2016
01:42:58,304 --> 01:43:00,608
Take your secret service away Obama

2017
01:43:01,120 --> 01:43:07,264
Take It All Away leave the White House unguarded Obama

2018
01:43:07,520 --> 01:43:08,032
Obama

2019
01:43:08,288 --> 01:43:09,824
What would happen in 30 seconds

2020
01:43:10,592 --> 01:43:12,896
Both of those people would no longer be on planet Earth

2021
01:43:15,456 --> 01:43:19,552
To drop drop our security measures

2022
01:43:20,064 --> 01:43:20,576
For what

2023
01:43:20,832 --> 01:43:25,184
This thing is very real and I don't see how it's being taken seriously

2024
01:43:25,440 --> 01:43:26,208
Except for the sick

2025
01:43:27,488 --> 01:43:33,120
You can't underestimate the sickness of the American people right now

2026
01:43:33,376 --> 01:43:35,168
But what you were confused

2027
01:43:36,960 --> 01:43:37,472
So

2028
01:43:37,728 --> 01:43:38,240
His point

2029
01:43:39,520 --> 01:43:40,032
Clinton

2030
01:43:40,288 --> 01:43:40,800
For Obama

2031
01:43:42,080 --> 01:43:42,592
Security detail

2032
01:43:44,896 --> 01:43:45,408
Would murder them

2033
01:43:46,176 --> 01:43:47,712
And he's probably

2034
01:43:48,480 --> 01:43:50,528
One of them

2035
01:43:50,784 --> 01:43:52,576
Isn't he saying that basically

2036
01:43:53,344 --> 01:43:56,416
If the live didn't have any protection

2037
01:43:56,672 --> 01:43:57,440
The Wrightwood murder

2038
01:43:57,696 --> 01:44:03,840
Yeah that's kind of exactly what I hear them saying and I'm confused as to why he thinks that makes him in the

2039
01:44:04,096 --> 01:44:08,448
The subtext of what he saying but he is also using this

2040
01:44:10,240 --> 01:44:13,568
The Second Amendment

2041
01:44:13,824 --> 01:44:16,128
Do something

2042
01:44:16,384 --> 01:44:18,688
I'm just saying that the people who love the Second Amendment

2043
01:44:18,944 --> 01:44:19,968
Notoriously violent

2044
01:44:23,808 --> 01:44:24,320
The thing

2045
01:44:24,576 --> 01:44:26,368
The thing there too is more the

2046
01:44:26,624 --> 01:44:27,648
Canard

2047
01:44:27,904 --> 01:44:29,184
Obama wants

2048
01:44:29,440 --> 01:44:30,208
To take your gun

2049
01:44:30,464 --> 01:44:35,072
I'm so they think that a reasonable argument against that is you have guards

2050
01:44:35,840 --> 01:44:37,632
You have guards protecting you

2051
01:44:37,888 --> 01:44:40,448
So why are you saying that I can't protect myself

2052
01:44:40,704 --> 01:44:44,544
And the problem with that logic is no one is saying you can't protect yourself

2053
01:44:45,312 --> 01:44:46,080
They're just saying

2054
01:44:46,848 --> 01:44:47,872
Victor

2055
01:44:48,640 --> 01:44:50,688
We should I get background checks for weapons

2056
01:44:51,968 --> 01:44:52,480
I don't

2057
01:44:52,736 --> 01:44:54,272
Get it I understand

2058
01:44:55,040 --> 01:44:55,808
We've been over this

2059
01:44:56,320 --> 01:44:57,344
I support people

2060
01:44:57,600 --> 01:44:58,368
Rights to have guns

2061
01:44:58,624 --> 01:44:59,136
Right

2062
01:44:59,392 --> 01:45:02,976
I can see every piece of evidence that Alex Jones brings up

2063
01:45:03,488 --> 01:45:05,792
In terms of the fears about people taking their guns

2064
01:45:06,304 --> 01:45:08,864
I look into them in they're not accurate they're not true

2065
01:45:09,632 --> 01:45:11,424
This Lion of like

2066
01:45:11,680 --> 01:45:14,496
You want me to put down my gun but you have guards

2067
01:45:15,008 --> 01:45:17,056
It falls so flat it's so

2068
01:45:17,568 --> 01:45:18,336
Defensive

2069
01:45:18,592 --> 01:45:19,360
It's so

2070
01:45:19,872 --> 01:45:20,896
Built on nothing

2071
01:45:22,688 --> 01:45:23,200
Yeah

2072
01:45:23,712 --> 01:45:24,224
I don't know what else

2073
01:45:25,504 --> 01:45:26,016
I mean

2074
01:45:28,576 --> 01:45:29,856
There though is

2075
01:45:30,624 --> 01:45:33,440
Imagine afraid of

2076
01:45:33,952 --> 01:45:34,464
When

2077
01:45:34,720 --> 01:45:36,000
We're just like Halo

2078
01:45:36,768 --> 01:45:37,536
What time's the background

2079
01:45:39,840 --> 01:45:43,936
Like what would they think was happening if we actually did come take their guns

2080
01:45:44,448 --> 01:45:49,568
Well I think we will never know that we will never know because that's not good

2081
01:45:50,592 --> 01:45:51,104
Of course not

2082
01:45:52,384 --> 01:45:55,712
Do you know what it's like

2083
01:45:55,968 --> 01:45:56,736
Steve threat

2084
01:45:57,248 --> 01:45:58,272
Of Obama

2085
01:45:58,528 --> 01:46:00,576
Saying like you know we should have background checks

2086
01:46:00,832 --> 01:46:01,600
It's waiting.

2087
01:46:01,856 --> 01:46:02,624
Some stuff like that

2088
01:46:02,880 --> 01:46:04,672
In order to cut down on raids killing

2089
01:46:04,928 --> 01:46:05,952
Things and stuff like that domestic

2090
01:46:06,208 --> 01:46:06,720
Situation

2091
01:46:06,976 --> 01:46:07,744
I'm getting out of control

2092
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:10,816
Go buy a gun and kill your wife and next

2093
01:46:11,072 --> 01:46:12,608
Let's see if we can find ways

2094
01:46:13,120 --> 01:46:14,912
To respect people Second Amendment right

2095
01:46:15,168 --> 01:46:16,960
But at the same time make the world safer

2096
01:46:17,216 --> 01:46:18,496
Cut down on rash violin

2097
01:46:19,008 --> 01:46:23,104
All I hear is take away my gun and they react

2098
01:46:23,360 --> 01:46:24,128
To the point where

2099
01:46:25,664 --> 01:46:30,016
It's for the next like 3 days tries to start a hashtag disarm Obamacare

2100
01:46:30,272 --> 01:46:35,648
Campaign tries to get a medium out there

2101
01:46:36,416 --> 01:46:40,256
The reaction that most people have two literal Nazis Gathering

2102
01:46:40,512 --> 01:46:41,536
They're like

2103
01:46:43,328 --> 01:46:47,424
Calm down

2104
01:46:47,680 --> 01:46:50,496
Bad guys are both sides you don't know what's in the

2105
01:46:51,520 --> 01:46:54,336
It's utter lunacy the reaction

2106
01:46:54,592 --> 01:46:58,176
The perceived threat as opposed to reasonable reaction to realtor

2107
01:47:02,528 --> 01:47:07,904
Right that's the threat you would respond like that to the threat

2108
01:47:08,160 --> 01:47:08,672
We're making

2109
01:47:10,208 --> 01:47:12,000
All black

2110
01:47:12,256 --> 01:47:13,024
People in Judaism

2111
01:47:13,536 --> 01:47:16,096
You should get the f*** out

2112
01:47:16,352 --> 01:47:17,632
I don't understand why you don't think

2113
01:47:17,888 --> 01:47:18,912
Like

2114
01:47:19,680 --> 01:47:20,704
I have every right

2115
01:47:21,216 --> 01:47:23,008
You believe that everybody but me

2116
01:47:23,264 --> 01:47:24,288
And people who look like

2117
01:47:25,824 --> 01:47:31,968
Break even an episode we're not going to release their the we had a clip of Millie Weaver who was there in Charlottesville

2118
01:47:34,528 --> 01:47:36,320
Is there a lot of them or just White

2119
01:47:36,576 --> 01:47:42,464
And Alex and Alex responding an agreement like that's not okay

2120
01:47:43,488 --> 01:47:45,280
You're if that's where you're at

2121
01:47:45,536 --> 01:47:46,816
You need to you need to look at

2122
01:47:47,840 --> 01:47:49,376
31 Moore clip of Drudge

2123
01:47:49,632 --> 01:47:51,680
Look around you if you're surrounded by Nazis

2124
01:47:55,008 --> 01:47:57,568
A little bit of information

2125
01:47:58,080 --> 01:47:58,592
Before we listen to

2126
01:47:59,360 --> 01:48:00,640
On the next day's show

2127
01:48:02,176 --> 01:48:02,688
Is furious

2128
01:48:03,200 --> 01:48:04,736
That everyone is reporting

2129
01:48:04,992 --> 01:48:07,552
That you had a weird with Matt Drudge

2130
01:48:08,320 --> 01:48:09,856
So far time is a flat circle

2131
01:48:10,112 --> 01:48:11,392
You're running out of time

2132
01:48:11,904 --> 01:48:12,416
But I'm

2133
01:48:12,672 --> 01:48:13,184
Time is Olive

2134
01:48:13,696 --> 01:48:14,464
We are all time

2135
01:48:14,720 --> 01:48:16,512
Don't say that you can do tomorrow

2136
01:48:16,768 --> 01:48:22,656
Time is a flat circle we're running out of Hillary's ahead of a jar

2137
01:48:22,912 --> 01:48:23,936
The Supreme Court has told us

2138
01:48:24,192 --> 01:48:25,216
We can't use headline

2139
01:48:25,728 --> 01:48:27,264
Pretty weird

2140
01:48:28,032 --> 01:48:29,568
Listen to this next clip

2141
01:48:29,824 --> 01:48:34,688
I think it justifies why anybody would think that this interview was f****** weird as s***

2142
01:48:35,200 --> 01:48:35,968
Cuz this is dumb

2143
01:48:36,224 --> 01:48:42,368
Well I'll say this week until name for start coming up

2144
01:48:42,624 --> 01:48:43,392
Was

2145
01:48:43,648 --> 01:48:46,208
Designed to be confused with their Eliza

2146
01:48:48,256 --> 01:48:54,144
Was the Enemy at the time

2147
01:48:54,400 --> 01:48:56,960
ResCare most likely

2148
01:48:57,984 --> 01:49:00,800
You get the depositions going you get the president under oath

2149
01:49:01,312 --> 01:49:02,336
You fight with a chain

2150
01:49:02,592 --> 01:49:05,152
Most likely

2151
01:49:05,408 --> 01:49:07,456
Boehner decided we're going there

2152
01:49:07,712 --> 01:49:09,504
Those Cities Burn

2153
01:49:10,016 --> 01:49:12,320
We're not going to do it

2154
01:49:15,904 --> 01:49:18,208
Aisa

2155
01:49:20,768 --> 01:49:24,352
Isis

2156
01:49:24,864 --> 01:49:31,008
To be confused with their license

2157
01:49:32,544 --> 01:49:33,312
Isis

2158
01:49:36,384 --> 01:49:42,272
You know these words

2159
01:49:42,528 --> 01:49:44,320
House

2160
01:49:44,576 --> 01:49:47,904
So he can't even keep it

2161
01:49:53,280 --> 01:49:55,328
It's Islamic State in Iraq and Syria

2162
01:49:59,424 --> 01:50:05,568
ORS or if you're confused about the isoparts Islamic

2163
01:50:06,080 --> 01:50:06,848
Iraq and the Levant

2164
01:50:07,360 --> 01:50:08,640
So I mean it's all.

2165
01:50:11,712 --> 01:50:13,248
All of the name

2166
01:50:17,344 --> 01:50:17,856
Vets

2167
01:50:18,112 --> 01:50:18,624
That's like

2168
01:50:19,136 --> 01:50:20,160
It's like a weird

2169
01:50:20,928 --> 01:50:22,976
Wait so you know the collective Batman

2170
01:50:24,768 --> 01:50:27,072
That's what does 60s

2171
01:50:28,352 --> 01:50:28,864
Yellow

2172
01:50:29,120 --> 01:50:30,144
Yellow is a lot

2173
01:50:30,656 --> 01:50:31,680
Melo Melo

2174
01:50:32,192 --> 01:50:36,032
Carmelo Anthony will be going to the next like that's just made-up nonsense

2175
01:50:37,824 --> 01:50:43,968
Stupid obviously

2176
01:50:46,016 --> 01:50:47,808
Like what happened with the pinto

2177
01:50:53,696 --> 01:50:54,208
What the f***

2178
01:50:54,976 --> 01:50:59,840
But the other thing is I think that he couldn't even keep a straight face while saying it cuz he knows I'm full of shity

2179
01:51:00,608 --> 01:51:01,632
I think that he's

2180
01:51:01,888 --> 01:51:03,936
Obviously just spitballing nonsense

2181
01:51:06,240 --> 01:51:09,312
I think that he want the audience to think he's not

2182
01:51:09,824 --> 01:51:11,104
But he is so

2183
01:51:11,616 --> 01:51:13,408
Like he's above the Joker

2184
01:51:15,200 --> 01:51:15,968
I think that

2185
01:51:16,480 --> 01:51:18,272
I think that he's tricking Alex up

2186
01:51:22,624 --> 01:51:27,232
Believe in 5 minutes flattering him as lip service in order to make sure that

2187
01:51:27,488 --> 01:51:29,024
Alex

2188
01:51:29,280 --> 01:51:32,096
I'm in spreads nonsense like a there Lysa

2189
01:51:32,352 --> 01:51:34,656
Is Bruce demonized by ISIS

2190
01:51:36,960 --> 01:51:37,472
Is demonizing

2191
01:51:37,728 --> 01:51:39,776
Aisa

2192
01:51:40,800 --> 01:51:42,592
So then Obama's like hey

2193
01:51:48,992 --> 01:51:50,528
Where was The Writers Workshop

2194
01:51:51,040 --> 01:51:51,808
Cuz I could have done better

2195
01:51:52,064 --> 01:51:54,624
This is evidence that he does not have a big staff

2196
01:51:56,672 --> 01:51:58,720
Is just he's running on field

2197
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:03,584
So that's that's about it for the 6

2198
01:52:03,840 --> 01:52:04,352
That they called

2199
01:52:04,864 --> 01:52:06,656
Darrell Issa

2200
01:52:06,912 --> 01:52:08,192
Make fun of Darrell

2201
01:52:08,960 --> 01:52:15,104
I thought the Darrell Hammond was named Johanna

2202
01:52:15,360 --> 01:52:17,152
With me

2203
01:52:18,176 --> 01:52:20,480
Hammond Indiana

2204
01:52:21,504 --> 01:52:27,648
I love you tell you I could do this all day

2205
01:52:27,904 --> 01:52:32,512
Good but let's not bring this to the end of

2206
01:52:32,768 --> 01:52:34,048
Legit no development

2207
01:52:34,304 --> 01:52:37,120
Pasta where we were in terms of his opinion store Trump

2208
01:52:37,632 --> 01:52:41,216
But I do believe that we're starting to see the forces come together

2209
01:52:41,472 --> 01:52:43,008
It weird

2210
01:52:43,264 --> 01:52:45,824
Comes on cuz it is rare pokes his little

2211
01:52:46,080 --> 01:52:48,128
F****** head out of his Miami condo

2212
01:52:48,384 --> 01:52:50,688
Gives interviews that's very strange

2213
01:52:51,200 --> 01:52:52,480
So it's a pretty big deal

2214
01:52:53,504 --> 01:52:55,552
I think there's consolidation that we're seeing

2215
01:52:55,808 --> 01:52:57,344
And on the heels of

2216
01:52:57,600 --> 01:53:00,416
Alex is very clear pro-russia pro-putin

2217
01:53:00,928 --> 01:53:02,208
Stances that he was making

2218
01:53:02,464 --> 01:53:03,488
In the days just

2219
01:53:03,744 --> 01:53:04,256
For this

2220
01:53:05,280 --> 01:53:08,096
I see I see trouble I see trouble

2221
01:53:08,608 --> 01:53:09,888
No definitive conclusions

2222
01:53:10,144 --> 01:53:10,912
But I see trouble

2223
01:53:11,168 --> 01:53:11,680
It's going to happen

2224
01:53:11,936 --> 01:53:13,216
To beat we're going to have to find

2225
01:53:13,728 --> 01:53:14,752
When we find the day

2226
01:53:19,360 --> 01:53:21,152
We're going to have to cross-reference it with

2227
01:53:21,408 --> 01:53:22,176
It's something else going

2228
01:53:23,200 --> 01:53:29,344
Find the day I might not be able to record for a week or so

2229
01:53:29,600 --> 01:53:30,112
And just

2230
01:53:30,624 --> 01:53:36,768
Dance around like a lunatic pour over everything from before that figure out

2231
01:53:37,024 --> 01:53:40,096
Like exactly what was going on with all the players involved

2232
01:53:41,632 --> 01:53:47,776
Find out what happened on Drudge Report the days before Rodger Stone

2233
01:53:48,032 --> 01:53:49,568
Find out what Trump has said

2234
01:53:49,824 --> 01:53:51,616
I very like read all of his

2235
01:53:51,872 --> 01:53:53,920
Appearances from the days before that

2236
01:53:54,176 --> 01:53:55,712
Cuz there's something I mean

2237
01:53:56,736 --> 01:53:58,528
I'm at the point where I don't believe

2238
01:53:58,784 --> 01:54:00,576
That he just decides who likes Trump

2239
01:54:00,832 --> 01:54:02,368
And I don't believe it's coincidence

2240
01:54:02,880 --> 01:54:03,392
At all

2241
01:54:03,648 --> 01:54:04,160
Not anymore

2242
01:54:04,416 --> 01:54:06,208
No I thought

2243
01:54:11,584 --> 01:54:13,376
Let's not make any rash conclusions

2244
01:54:13,632 --> 01:54:15,424
Of course the Russian narrative is

2245
01:54:16,448 --> 01:54:17,472
Because it's happening

2246
01:54:17,728 --> 01:54:20,032
Concurrently with the present where there's

2247
01:54:20,544 --> 01:54:21,824
The Mueller investigation

2248
01:54:22,336 --> 01:54:22,848
All of these

2249
01:54:23,616 --> 01:54:25,152
Going on like my first thought is

2250
01:54:25,408 --> 01:54:26,176
Of course

2251
01:54:26,688 --> 01:54:27,968
We are going to be more likely

2252
01:54:28,224 --> 01:54:29,248
Play the sea Russia ever

2253
01:54:30,016 --> 01:54:31,040
Right even when we're going

2254
01:54:31,552 --> 01:54:33,856
But God dammit this whole thing

2255
01:54:37,696 --> 01:54:38,464
Coming on

2256
01:54:39,232 --> 01:54:40,768
Resin and

2257
01:54:41,024 --> 01:54:42,304
Yeah yeah yeah

2258
01:54:46,400 --> 01:54:47,168
I've kept a running

2259
01:54:51,776 --> 01:54:53,056
I mailed it to have influenced

2260
01:54:54,080 --> 01:54:55,872
I nailed it

2261
01:54:56,128 --> 01:54:58,688
I agree with you and I believe

2262
01:54:58,944 --> 01:54:59,456
We've done

2263
01:54:59,712 --> 01:55:01,760
As best we can to push back again

2264
01:55:02,784 --> 01:55:04,064
Willy-nilly jumping in

2265
01:55:04,320 --> 01:55:05,088
To that conclusion

2266
01:55:05,344 --> 01:55:11,488
And like I said I think that there's something going on and it doesn't necessarily mean

2267
01:55:11,744 --> 01:55:12,256
Oggi's

2268
01:55:12,512 --> 01:55:13,024
Bentofu

2269
01:55:13,280 --> 01:55:15,328
But it's clear that he likes Buddha

2270
01:55:15,840 --> 01:55:16,864
Before he likes Trump

2271
01:55:18,400 --> 01:55:18,912
Anybody else

2272
01:55:19,168 --> 01:55:20,192
And that's not nothing

2273
01:55:20,448 --> 01:55:21,728
Helix

2274
01:55:21,984 --> 01:55:22,496
Ram's Horn

2275
01:55:23,520 --> 01:55:24,032
Seems like it

2276
01:55:24,288 --> 01:55:25,056
That seems like

2277
01:55:25,568 --> 01:55:27,872
You know what I like more than Rand Paul

2278
01:55:28,128 --> 01:55:28,640

The world is a

01:56:43,392 --> 01:56:46,720
Massive nonsense and violence right now

Pikachu

Would never come out of the mouth of a John Rappaport I'll tell you that right now

2311
01:56:59,776 --> 01:57:00,544
Time is the flats

2312
01:57:01,056 --> 01:57:03,616
You think the John Rappaport speak to that poetically

2313
01:57:03,872 --> 01:57:10,016
We've already got the CIA

2314
01:57:10,272 --> 01:57:14,368
Sorry

2315
01:57:14,880 --> 01:57:21,024
