00:00:21,504 --> 00:00:27,648

00:00:34,304 --> 00:00:40,448
Monica

00:01:03,744 --> 00:01:05,280
Beverages and talk a little bit

5
00:01:10,144 --> 00:01:10,656
Choking

6
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,752
Call a number of times

7
00:01:19,104 --> 00:01:25,248
If you were putting together an American Olympics shooting team you would not come today

8
00:01:25,504 --> 00:01:27,808
One that sticks out the most to me was when I was like

9
00:01:28,576 --> 00:01:29,600
Let's call it

10
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:30,368

11
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:32,928
Pool

12
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:34,208
In Columbia Missouri

13
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:35,488

14
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:36,512

15
00:01:36,768 --> 00:01:37,280

17
00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:46,496
Not in the water frame

18
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:48,288
Hot dogs

19
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:51,872
Into all that well swallowed I could feel like

20
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:58,528
The Ono Ono Ono

21
00:01:58,784 --> 00:02:04,928
Friends were laughing

22
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:11,072
I'm going to the pool having fun a joke

23
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:14,400
Parable

24
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:15,168
Against

25
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:18,752
Chair

26
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:20,544
Memories are a little bit vague

27
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:21,568
Lack of oxygen

28
00:02:21,824 --> 00:02:27,968
Self

29
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:29,760
Beautifying

30
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:33,344

What what time is it last year

33
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:45,888

34
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:47,680
Should Have Cheated more

35
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:48,960

37
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:51,264
Feeling of like

Alright I do a podcast about Alex Jones being a liar I'm going to choke on this sandwich

00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:16,352
No matter what we're destined to die in a conspiracy theory

42
00:03:17,888 --> 00:03:18,400
Dislodging that

43
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:21,472
I survived to this day on

44
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:24,288

Care right now about the

51
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:55,008
The present day

52
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,800

For Friday

54
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,104
Not entirely sure I might

55
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,152
Do an episode about it then

56
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:02,432

What's going on

64
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:24,959
It really feels like

65
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:26,495
Unfollowing that bread

66
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:29,567
Over March 29th

67
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:30,847

Confusing and fun

77
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:50,303
Informative

78
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:51,839
Frustrating

79
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:53,375
I'd like to

80
00:04:55,935 --> 00:04:58,495
To create that frustrating and informative

81
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:02,079
Not the fear

82
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:03,103

Freakishly large

96

Charlie

97
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:12,479

00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:20,415
Like I said we're back in

101
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:25,023
Alex

102
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:25,791
The 29th

103
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:28,095
In an interesting way

104
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:29,375
What we speak

105
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:31,679
Is Alex talking over the

106
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:32,447
The bumper music

107
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:35,263
Like you coming into the show

108
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:36,287
From

109
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:39,103
FEMA occupied regions

110
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:46,271
For that but I think he doesn't know his mic is on

111
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:48,063
And then he pretends that he

112
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:48,831
Is Mike

113
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:49,855
Ikeno

114
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:52,159
He pretends that he's aware of it and he's doing it on

115
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:52,927
You'll see

116
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:59,583
Batman movie

117
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:05,983
Mainstream media

118
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:11,103
My life like a Batman movie

119
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:14,431
Call my Mike

120
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:20,575
He was driving into work that day and a piece of plastic

121
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:25,183
It came off of a truck

122
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:29,279
For the day

123
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:35,167
He's thrilled to be alive if you could have died out on the highway it is

124
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:38,239
Man movie

125
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:40,031
There are similarities

126
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:41,055
Batman

127
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:42,847
There we go

128
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:45,407
So Alex has an interesting narrative

129
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:46,431
He's pitching on

130
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:50,271
You trying to

131
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:54,623
Incredibly consist

132
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:55,391
Throughout his career

133
00:07:58,207 --> 00:07:58,719
Prominent

134
00:07:58,975 --> 00:07:59,487
Right now

135
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:00,511
Stretch

136
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:02,815
And that is the everybody who's in

137
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:03,839
Important love

138
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:10,495
World leaders are interested in what Alex's doing everyday

139
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:14,847
Rogue world leaders are concerned about

140
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:15,871
So

141
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:19,199
Is Alex talking about that a little bit in a way that

142
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:19,967
What is

143
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:21,247
Rathe

144
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:32,767
This is about Kim Jong

145
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:36,351
Honor last episode

146
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:40,191
Kim Jong-un

147
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:40,959
Kim Jeong Hoon

148
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:41,983
Come out

149
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:42,751
Is responding to

150
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:46,335
Talking about

151
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:51,199
The world

152
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:53,503
That he's a probably watching the show

153
00:08:58,111 --> 00:09:01,183
Just like your degenerate father

154
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:03,743
You little piece of trash

155
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:09,375
Austin such a military Target

156
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:20,895
Little turd

157
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:22,943
So Kim

158
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:28,831
Unbelievable

159
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:31,647
Listens to his show

160
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:32,671
And because

161
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:34,719
Yelling about how soon is a demon

162
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:37,791
Kim Jeong Hoon has made plans to bomb Austin to shut Alex

163
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:39,071
That's the only thing

164
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:40,351
That is

165
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:42,143
Legitimately what Alex

166
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:42,911
Is

167
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:45,983
Leader of North Korea

168
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:52,383
United States

169
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:56,991
Which will 8 a.m.

170
00:09:57,247 --> 00:10:00,575
We have to shut about

171
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:04,415
Alex is too much of a risk

172
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:09,279
Be on fire right now if they'd Alex believes in Freedom

173
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:15,679
Kim Jeong hoon is against Freedom there for Kim Jeong Hoon Must Destroy out

174
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:17,471
Supligen

175
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:20,287
Higher half of the country would be on fire

176
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:22,847
Jesus yeah it's pretty crazy

177
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:27,455
Replacing himself is radio show

178
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:31,295
He's on the elevated pedestal

179
00:10:31,551 --> 00:10:32,063
Target

180
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:34,879
I can't believe someone would listen to his show and not because

181
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:36,159
Concerned about his well-being

182
00:10:36,415 --> 00:10:37,439
After saying something like

183
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:43,071
Like that like or this guy is so full of s*** is f****** around like why would you

184
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:49,471
Either you're crazy or this is completely unreliable

185
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:53,567
Post on MK news

186
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:54,847
North Korea news

187
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:58,431
With the headline quote North Korean photo reveals us mainland

188
00:10:58,687 --> 00:10:59,199
Strike plan

189
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:03,807
I've read this article and I have to say that from the blurriness of the photo that's in

190
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:07,903
Included I don't even think it's a fair assessment to say that Austin is even one of the target

191
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:09,439
There is a line

192
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:10,207
On the maps

193
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:11,487
Supposedly a mistletoe

194
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:13,535
Which appears to end in Central Tech

195
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:15,583
But the problem is it

196
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,631
Stops there

197
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:18,655
Or that's just where the

198
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:22,239
Picture of the u.s. map is blocked by one of the North Korean soldiers

199
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:25,567
His problem

200
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:31,455
Because of this even a composite overlay appears to

201
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:33,247
To show San Diego Washington DC

202
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:37,855
KC Hawaii and possibly Austin is being primary Targets in a North Korean attack

203
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:45,023
They had to make a composite overlay where this they superimpose the map over the soldiers hat and then guess where

204
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:46,047
That line ended

205
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:51,167
His hat also cover the entire southeastern United States could have ended anywhere

206
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:54,239
But it's probably Austin because Alex has been talking s*** about you

207
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:55,007
Ninjago

208
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:59,103
That was his much of a map as they could have four

209
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:05,759
They couldn't afford the second they couldn't afford the easternmost

210
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:12,927
Don't make a composite

211
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:15,999
Sure it's operating

212
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:18,047
Information

213
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:24,191
The other thing that's important to point out is that this image was not information that North Korea released at the world to threaten

214
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:28,799
It was published in MK news image in rodong

215
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:30,335
The newspaper of the

216
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:31,615
Taqueria Workers Party

217
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:35,455
The folks that has believe that this is indicative that the message

218
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:38,015
Intended for an internal North Korean audience

219
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:39,039
Not the world

220
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:41,087
John Swenson right

221
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:42,623
Senior lecturer

222
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:43,647
East Asian

223
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:44,671
International relations

224
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:47,743
Is the University of Cambridge quotes

225
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:51,071
It seems reasonable to suppose that the target map is designs

226
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:52,095
For home consumption

227
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:53,375
Create an impression

228
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:54,399
Nerf war Readiness for

229
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:55,679
Dprk

230
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:56,447
Citizen

231
00:12:56,703 --> 00:12:57,983
Part of the wider policy

232
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:06,431
This was a piece of propaganda meant for interred for an internal audience

233
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:08,479
It's a wild man Alex and

234
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:10,527
Something like that

235
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:14,111
Look and decide that the real story here is about himself

236
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:22,303
I'm sure there's no evidence that Austin was even one of their targets

237
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:26,143
This is deeply troubling

238
00:13:26,655 --> 00:13:27,679
Because only two

239
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:28,447
Nations icon

240
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:29,983
CR outrageous levels

241
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:30,751
Narcissism

242
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:32,799
To the point where he actually believes the moonless

243
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:39,199
Unbelievable level of comfort

244
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:40,735
And his audience will just believe it

245
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:45,087
It's not for they'll just ignore it or it like it'll be

246
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:49,695
To me so much of this has to be like water off a duck's back

247
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:52,511
After so many of his listeners where it's like

248
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:54,047
A stroke out unless something

249
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:56,351
Applies directly to them

250
00:13:56,607 --> 00:14:00,959
In the same way that Alex can't pay attention to anything without applying it directly to himself

251
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:03,519
Alexa says all this narcissist

252
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:06,079
And his listeners are like okay

253
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:11,967
But still has some sort of a residual

254
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:13,503
Even if it rolls off

255
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:16,063
Because you

256
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:18,367
Even if you're like well whatever

257
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:21,439
Status of like

258
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:23,231
Super important geopolitical

259
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:26,559
Experience of listening to it even if you don't

260
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:28,095
Take that in and fully in

261
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:29,887
Internalize it as like something important

262
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:33,983
It still gives the appearance that like well I mean it's dictators want to take out

263
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:38,847
Stupid

264
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:40,383
Have to

265
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:41,407
Amplify the

266
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:43,199
Threat to them

267
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:46,015
Specifically

268
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:48,575
Almost better and more effect

269
00:14:49,087 --> 00:14:51,135
If it is that sort of thing where it is

270
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:51,903
Easy to do

271
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:53,439
Just sort of like Let It Roll Off

272
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:54,463
Yeah

273
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:57,279
Because then you don't sit and think about it too long to realize

274
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:01,631
Stupid

275
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:02,911
You're crazy

276
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:07,007
Another headline

277
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:08,799
To get into and this is another thing

278
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:10,591
Things that I believe is indicative

279
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:11,615
Of all of Alex's

280
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:12,383
Does pattern of

281
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:13,663
Saying that everybody

282
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:14,943
In very astute

283
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:15,711
Situations

284
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:18,783
This is a trend that's going running

285
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:19,551
Counter

286
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:20,575
To Alex

287
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:22,367
Hook

288
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:24,415
And this is the path where we see

289
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:27,999
I'm saving some people in the Aurora shooting were actors

290
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:28,767
The G20

291
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:30,047
Person who is arrest

292
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:31,071
Did was an actor

293
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:33,119
And now we have another exam

294
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:37,727
American Terrorist

295
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:55,647
So

296
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:03,583
Eric harroun

297
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:05,631
I was an American citizen who was arrested

298
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:06,911
Sit in a very complicated

299
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:07,935
Situation back in

300
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:15,359
There's a version that Alex is putting forth which is that he was an American soldier who decided to start saying LK it was great

301
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:19,455
Most likely because he's a paid actor and then the government had stage in the rest covers

302
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:20,223
Things up or something

303
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:25,599
Obviously the globalist paid him to protect us portal creative because he's part of a larger psyops

304
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:30,975
Which Alex would tell you is impossible

305
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:32,767
That's the only

306
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:34,559
It makes as much sense

307
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:39,423
Sandwiches

308
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:40,959
Beyond that just kind of being a dumb

309
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:43,007
Conception his version of this story

310
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:44,287
Leo burst

311
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:46,847
I routed been in the army

312
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:49,407
Bad behavioral issue

313
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:50,431
When he was in love

314
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:52,223
According to the New Yorker

315
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:57,855
Fellow-soldiers service

316
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:01,695
Which he was a passenger in a drunk driving

317
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:04,255
Which led to him suffering from

318
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:09,119
He got a medical waiver and honorable discharge that's

319
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:11,167
It's for bullfighting career in the US service

320
00:17:12,191 --> 00:17:15,775
In the years that followed the New Yorker paints a picture of a really f***** up guy

321
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:17,311
Discussing is stocking in a

322
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:19,103
Ex-girlfriend which ultimately led to

323
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:20,639
Shooting himself in the abdomen

324
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:21,407
What you wouldn't take

325
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:24,223
The article also says use rest

326
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:25,759
Twice for DUI

327
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:27,295
A real trouble pass

328
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:30,879
That might to him going overseas

329
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:32,159
A meeting people

330
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:32,927
And getting into

331
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:33,695
First aid in Freedom

332
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:39,071
It all the interviews I've read including

333
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:41,375
It's abundantly clear that Eric harroun was

334
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:42,655
Not in Elkader

335
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:44,447
He was a committed

336
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:45,215
Anti-anxiety

337
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:47,263
To join up with rebels in Syria

338
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:49,311
If you wanted to help overthrow Assad

339
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:52,895
And in the process he allegedly accidentally got mixed up with a G

340
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:55,455
He joined up with

341
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:58,015
A separate group that was ostensibly aligned with the United

342
00:17:58,271 --> 00:17:59,807
State but after a skirmish

343
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:00,831
In the ensuing chaos

344
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:01,855
Has he got a ride

345
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:03,135
The in-and-out knows were truck

346
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:04,927
Away from the fighting

347
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:07,743
Any ended up embedded with them for about

348
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:08,767
25 days

349
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:10,815
Which you could kind of believe is a mistake

350
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:12,863
Considering that haroun didn't know Arabic

351
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:16,447
Due to his linguistic confusion there's even some doubt that he was at

352
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:18,495
Actually ever even with Elmo's World

353
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:19,263
As opposed to

354
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:21,311
The possibility he was with a group like

355
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:23,615
And he just didn't know the difference

356
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:28,735
What is father says that you was working with the CIA as Alex

357
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:29,759
Just got this

358
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:32,575
He doesn't mean that he was in

359
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:33,343
Cheerio bee

360
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:34,367
He was working with us

361
00:18:34,623 --> 00:18:35,135
CIA

362
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:37,695
With the CIA

363
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:38,463
To be able to

364
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:39,743
The United States

365
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:43,327
In the foreign policy article

366
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:44,607
Describes the CIA

367
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:47,167
When he's dealing with them about like

368
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:49,983
Trying to not get charged with

369
00:18:56,383 --> 00:18:56,895
The bad cop

370
00:18:57,151 --> 00:18:58,431
Map to the FBI's good cop

371
00:18:58,943 --> 00:18:59,455
In their discussion

372
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:01,247
Yeah they're both

373
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:02,271
They're both

374
00:19:02,783 --> 00:19:03,551
They're both good

375
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:08,415
Ensure

376
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:09,951
According to that New York

377
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:12,511
In 2008 Eric and reached out to this

378
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:13,535
CIA about a Reece

379
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:14,303
Some trippy take

380
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:15,071
Cancel Lebanon

381
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:19,679
I need a received a reply from a guy named Wayne appear to be operating a dummy

382
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:20,447
Email account

383
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:22,751
Wayne did appear to act as a bit of a

384
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:23,519
The Handler

385
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:24,799
I was trying to get Eric to

386
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:26,079
Spy on a local mosque

387
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:29,663
Perform all available information it doesn't appear that relationship

388
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:34,015
Nor did it have anything to do with a Terex later Adventure is

389
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:35,039
In the Middle East

390
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:38,367
It does seem like it explains why he would approach

391
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:40,927
The CIA

392
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:43,487
Which is exactly what

393
00:19:43,743 --> 00:19:48,095
Right it makes a lot of built-up from interacting with

394
00:19:48,351 --> 00:19:49,375
Giants rings

395
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:51,167
To help him get information on this

396
00:19:55,263 --> 00:19:57,823
They wouldn't charge him with the war crimes that it appeared

397
00:19:58,079 --> 00:20:00,127
You may have been involved down

398
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:01,151
So f******

399
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:06,783
Never not in a million years Hugo the f******

400
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,063
Harrison Ford Road

401
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:10,367
You Escape

402
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:11,647
You go on the Run

403
00:20:11,903 --> 00:20:17,023
Until you find the real killer turn yourself in they are not your friend

404
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:19,071
They are trying to come after

405
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:22,143
Whatever the case is very motivated

406
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:25,983
Whatever the case is about whether or not he deserve to go to jail for his action

407
00:20:26,751 --> 00:20:29,055
She's I can't really settle for you or the

408
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:33,407
There's no credible reason to believe that Eric harroun is in

409
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:35,967
That's just a completely insane

410
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:38,015
It fits very neatly without Alex's

411
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:40,831
Beginning to incorporate actors in so many of his narrative

412
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:45,183
Erica Reed died in April 2014 of a drug

413
00:20:45,951 --> 00:20:47,999
Which I'm going to guess Alex would say is actually

414
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:49,023
Is the globalist hit

415
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:49,791
Stake him out

416
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:53,887
Play Department you wasn't useful anymore happen that way

417
00:20:54,143 --> 00:20:55,935
In reality Eric had struggled with a Dick's

418
00:20:56,191 --> 00:20:56,703
In his whole life

419
00:20:56,959 --> 00:21:00,287
Rehab for heroin in 2011 and be hospitalized for

420
00:21:01,311 --> 00:21:02,591
Before an overdose

421
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:03,615
About 4 months

422
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:04,383
Before his death

423
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:05,663
December twenty

424
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:07,967
13news found unresponsive

425
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:11,295
It's hard not to imagine that these six months

426
00:21:11,551 --> 00:21:13,343
The solitary confinement he was subjected to

427
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:15,135
Which ended in September

428
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:15,903
2013

429
00:21:16,159 --> 00:21:17,184
Could have played a role

430
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:18,208
Is relapse

431
00:21:21,536 --> 00:21:25,376
Describe his torture could play a role in

432
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:26,656
Drug addicts death

433
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:27,680
Which was the

434
00:21:27,936 --> 00:21:28,960
Strange

435
00:21:29,472 --> 00:21:32,032
Is the tragic story of a complicated person who did

436
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:33,824
Probably unwise

437
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:34,592
Is things

438
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:37,664
Possibly motivated by actually wanting to

439
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:43,040
Depressed people in Syria possibly but also

440
00:21:43,296 --> 00:21:45,600
Motivated clearly by some vaguely

441
00:21:46,112 --> 00:21:48,416
Somatic and anti-zionist ideas

442
00:21:49,952 --> 00:21:50,464
Desire in need

443
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:57,888
Is life and the fact that in the present-day someone could just

444
00:21:58,144 --> 00:21:59,680
Decide to do that

445
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:01,216
Freetress

446
00:22:04,288 --> 00:22:05,824
Got

447
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,384
Highly possible that he

448
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,152
Slapstick

449
00:22:09,408 --> 00:22:10,944
His way into the tower

450
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:12,736
You know

451
00:22:14,528 --> 00:22:16,320
Pictures of Herbie rides

452
00:22:16,576 --> 00:22:20,672
Cool we're in a war zone this guy seems nice if somebody's offering you a ride

453
00:22:20,928 --> 00:22:22,464
They're nice guys they're not trying to

454
00:22:33,216 --> 00:22:34,240
Truck

455
00:22:35,776 --> 00:22:39,616
The Prisoner for a while then there was another battle

456
00:22:46,528 --> 00:22:47,808
I don't know how much of this is

457
00:22:48,064 --> 00:22:49,600
Apocryphal and whatever

458
00:22:51,648 --> 00:22:52,416
This is

459
00:22:52,928 --> 00:22:56,768
Complicated f****** story that a lot of people have looked into and research

460
00:22:57,024 --> 00:22:58,560
Pretty well

461
00:22:58,816 --> 00:23:02,400
Even their versions of ambiguity

462
00:23:02,656 --> 00:23:03,168
About

463
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,472
Precise details about a lot of stuff

464
00:23:05,728 --> 00:23:07,008
But what is

465
00:23:07,776 --> 00:23:09,056
Pretty clear from everything I've read

466
00:23:09,824 --> 00:23:10,336
Not an actor

467
00:23:10,592 --> 00:23:12,896
And Alex would rather get rid of all that

468
00:23:13,408 --> 00:23:14,176
Great.

469
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:15,200
Complicated

470
00:23:15,712 --> 00:23:20,576
Reality by just writing them off as an actor

471
00:23:21,344 --> 00:23:22,880
Annette's. That's not good

472
00:23:25,184 --> 00:23:28,000
Early forties

473
00:23:28,256 --> 00:23:28,768
You see whatever

474
00:23:29,792 --> 00:23:30,304
I don't know I

475
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:33,632
Syria

476
00:23:35,424 --> 00:23:36,704
Sure

477
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:38,240
Done it that way

478
00:23:38,496 --> 00:23:39,776
I see that

479
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,664
Alex has a big special report that he's bragging

480
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,456
About on this episode 129

481
00:23:47,712 --> 00:23:49,248
Already

482
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:50,784
He's trying to troll people

483
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:54,624
Because the title of it is Alex Jones endorses gun control

484
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:57,952
Already angry

485
00:23:58,208 --> 00:23:59,232
Wolf course

486
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:00,512
The right is too good at

487
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:06,144
Of course the point of it is I don't endorse gun control I endorse gun control for that

488
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:08,960
Government taken away

489
00:24:09,216 --> 00:24:09,984
Fine I'm fine

490
00:24:10,496 --> 00:24:11,264
Sure here's a little

491
00:24:18,176 --> 00:24:20,480
No not yet

492
00:24:20,736 --> 00:24:22,528
Liberty

493
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,136
Evil is restrained

494
00:24:27,392 --> 00:24:28,672
Cowboy

495
00:24:30,464 --> 00:24:32,000
Try and quote Thomas Jefferson

496
00:24:34,048 --> 00:24:37,376
This is so much of a running joke

497
00:24:37,632 --> 00:24:38,144
He's f****** with

498
00:24:39,168 --> 00:24:40,192
Don't think I don't know man

499
00:24:40,448 --> 00:24:41,472
Just doesn't know anything

500
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:48,896
The very atmosphere of firearms anywhere and everywhere restrains

501
00:24:49,152 --> 00:24:49,664
Evil interfere

502
00:24:50,432 --> 00:24:51,968
We've gone over this before but again

503
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:53,760
It's essential point

504
00:24:54,016 --> 00:25:00,160
Even a fake Thomas Jefferson quote Washington quote

505
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:01,440
Hunting magazine from 90

506
00:25:01,696 --> 00:25:02,208
T26

507
00:25:02,976 --> 00:25:05,280
It's essential to keep highlighting

508
00:25:05,536 --> 00:25:07,072
Because it shows how little Alex

509
00:25:07,328 --> 00:25:09,888
Cares about these supposed history claims to be an egg

510
00:25:10,144 --> 00:25:11,936
Expert in

511
00:25:12,192 --> 00:25:14,496
These founding fathers

512
00:25:14,752 --> 00:25:15,264
You fake quotes

513
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,544
4patriot message board

514
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,080
He pulls out whenever he needs

515
00:25:18,336 --> 00:25:18,848
Bratz doll

516
00:25:19,872 --> 00:25:20,384
Crazy

517
00:25:23,456 --> 00:25:25,504
You can't be that wrong about Thomas

518
00:25:26,528 --> 00:25:29,088
There's just so many

519
00:25:35,744 --> 00:25:37,024
How can you be wrong

520
00:25:39,328 --> 00:25:40,352
It's very impressive

521
00:25:42,144 --> 00:25:45,216
The arrival of Steve

522
00:25:45,472 --> 00:25:47,264
The argument

523
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:51,872
No kid died at Sandy Hook there wasn't even a shooter it didn't happen it's all bulshit

524
00:25:52,128 --> 00:25:52,896
Stevi B's coming in

525
00:25:53,664 --> 00:25:55,456
And Alex push back

526
00:25:55,712 --> 00:25:57,504
About it and actually sounded

527
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,040
Kind of excited about it

528
00:25:59,296 --> 00:26:00,064
He didn't leave

529
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,368
A really strong impression of

530
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:03,392
Disagree

531
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:09,792
He has one

532
00:26:10,048 --> 00:26:11,328
People have said stuff like that in the past

533
00:26:12,096 --> 00:26:13,632
So on the 29th

534
00:26:15,424 --> 00:26:16,192
With a little

535
00:26:16,448 --> 00:26:16,960
Surprised

536
00:26:17,216 --> 00:26:18,752
And also a little bit not surprised

537
00:26:19,008 --> 00:26:19,520
Figure that

538
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:26,432
Running around

539
00:26:32,832 --> 00:26:34,880
Okay

540
00:26:35,648 --> 00:26:37,184
Alex

541
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,488
Alex

542
00:26:39,744 --> 00:26:40,512
Still believe

543
00:26:40,768 --> 00:26:41,280
The kids workout

544
00:26:41,536 --> 00:26:43,584
It does sound like he's referring to

545
00:26:45,376 --> 00:26:48,192
The people who say

546
00:26:48,448 --> 00:26:49,216
There

547
00:26:49,984 --> 00:26:50,496
Is that

548
00:26:51,264 --> 00:26:52,288
Is that a defense

549
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:53,824
Music

550
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:56,896
I don't think so

551
00:26:57,152 --> 00:27:03,296
No no you missed it I also said that they loved it

552
00:27:03,552 --> 00:27:06,880
Global Aquatics

553
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:10,208
To be like one of his only reasons for holding out like

554
00:27:12,512 --> 00:27:13,280
Ditto kids died

555
00:27:13,536 --> 00:27:14,048
Is that like

556
00:27:14,816 --> 00:27:19,168
The globalist love killing kids why wouldn't I do that

557
00:27:21,728 --> 00:27:22,240
Jewelry

558
00:27:22,496 --> 00:27:23,008
Kids for free

559
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:25,056
Does seem strange

560
00:27:25,568 --> 00:27:27,360
But that's because I

561
00:27:27,616 --> 00:27:28,384
Text is not swayed

562
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:31,712
He is not right

563
00:27:31,968 --> 00:27:33,248
I still think that is

564
00:27:33,504 --> 00:27:36,832
How it ends up going bad

565
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:38,624
Text board

566
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:41,696
He's on his show and Little Voices

567
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:42,720
That's Mike Adams

568
00:27:42,976 --> 00:27:43,744
Adam

569
00:27:44,256 --> 00:27:45,792
He still telling him

570
00:27:48,096 --> 00:27:48,864
Now it's

571
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:49,632
Time

572
00:27:50,144 --> 00:27:50,656
Alex

573
00:27:50,912 --> 00:27:51,424
Has started

574
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:52,192
Didn't notice

575
00:27:52,448 --> 00:27:53,216
Some of these

576
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:54,752
Inconsistency

577
00:27:55,264 --> 00:27:56,544
About the story

578
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:00,896
Enter he starting to incorporate more

579
00:28:30,592 --> 00:28:34,688
What do you think

580
00:28:42,368 --> 00:28:43,648
So they're having a lot of fun

581
00:28:43,904 --> 00:28:45,184
5 workshop and

582
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:56,192
Radiological

583
00:28:57,472 --> 00:29:00,544
Listen to enjoy that conversation

584
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:01,568
Good time

585
00:29:01,824 --> 00:29:02,336
It's like sex

586
00:29:02,592 --> 00:29:04,384
Play would you rather

587
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,688
Can for it there like how do you want it

588
00:29:10,784 --> 00:29:15,136
A couple of examples

589
00:29:15,392 --> 00:29:17,952
The arguments that Alex uses

590
00:29:18,208 --> 00:29:18,720
Later

591
00:29:18,976 --> 00:29:22,304
In defense of the crisis actors no one died there

592
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:26,400
Guy caught in the woods Bloomberg technology

593
00:29:26,912 --> 00:29:27,936
He has these

594
00:29:28,192 --> 00:29:29,728
Narratives that he's putting forth

595
00:29:29,984 --> 00:29:30,496
These pieces of in

596
00:29:30,752 --> 00:29:31,776
Information has been consisting

597
00:29:32,544 --> 00:29:35,616
Which you will later blame people like

598
00:29:36,128 --> 00:29:38,944
Wolfgang halbig is in no way mentioned

599
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,760
He hasn't been on the show there has been no indication

600
00:29:43,808 --> 00:29:45,344
Awareness of ham or interact

601
00:29:46,112 --> 00:29:47,392
This appears to be

602
00:29:47,648 --> 00:29:49,184
Things that Alex has learned of

603
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,464
News reporter

604
00:29:50,976 --> 00:29:53,280
These things that will be part of the

605
00:29:53,536 --> 00:29:54,048
Hook

606
00:29:54,304 --> 00:29:55,584
No one died their argument

607
00:29:56,096 --> 00:29:57,120
Are there now

608
00:29:57,888 --> 00:29:58,912
But he still doesn't believe

609
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:00,960
Bloomberg

610
00:30:05,056 --> 00:30:05,568
How big

611
00:30:06,336 --> 00:30:07,360
Alex

612
00:30:11,712 --> 00:30:14,272
So it's for the 29th

613
00:30:14,784 --> 00:30:15,552
Adams

614
00:30:15,808 --> 00:30:16,832
Just have like a

615
00:30:17,344 --> 00:30:17,856
I try to be Joker

616
00:30:19,136 --> 00:30:19,648
That's not

617
00:30:21,184 --> 00:30:22,976
Especially Mike Adams

618
00:30:28,096 --> 00:30:31,168
The Friday

619
00:30:31,424 --> 00:30:33,728
We come in on the 31st

620
00:30:33,984 --> 00:30:36,800
And I don't know if you know this but March 31st 2013

621
00:30:37,312 --> 00:30:37,824
That was Easter

622
00:30:42,944 --> 00:30:43,968
Sometimes can be

623
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:47,552
Did not know that Easter and Alex

624
00:30:47,808 --> 00:30:49,088
Opens the show

625
00:30:54,208 --> 00:30:56,512
In front of me

626
00:30:56,768 --> 00:30:59,072
Constitutional

627
00:31:02,912 --> 00:31:04,192
Terrorist murderers

628
00:31:12,128 --> 00:31:15,200
Big smiles

629
00:31:30,048 --> 00:31:32,864
A free Society doesn't include television

630
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:37,472
Programs like this weird argument to be made by an anti

631
00:31:37,728 --> 00:31:39,776
Free Society

632
00:31:40,032 --> 00:31:41,824
Would make sure that these things

633
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:45,408
Would be censored and away from visual

634
00:31:45,664 --> 00:31:47,456
Devices

635
00:31:47,712 --> 00:31:51,552
Sure more free than censoring my political enemies

636
00:31:52,064 --> 00:31:53,088
For sure

637
00:31:53,344 --> 00:31:55,392
Easter is one of the biggest holidays

638
00:31:55,648 --> 00:31:56,416
Christian religion

639
00:31:56,928 --> 00:32:01,536
The day off to be with his family or go to services

640
00:32:02,048 --> 00:32:04,096
I don't think that's a shame I just want to point out

641
00:32:04,352 --> 00:32:05,120
Does how he celebrates

642
00:32:05,376 --> 00:32:05,888
Recognize

643
00:32:06,144 --> 00:32:08,704
Is the day when Christians worldwide

644
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:13,056
Select on how Jesus died for their sins and opened up a possibility of living

645
00:32:13,312 --> 00:32:14,336
Free from the bondage

646
00:32:15,616 --> 00:32:17,664
Easter egg hunts for the neighborhood

647
00:32:18,176 --> 00:32:20,736
Some people make a nice meal and commune with our loved one

648
00:32:21,248 --> 00:32:24,576
And people like Alex get on a nationally syndicated radio program

649
00:32:24,832 --> 00:32:25,600
Complain about fox

650
00:32:25,856 --> 00:32:26,880
Drama shows

651
00:32:29,184 --> 00:32:34,560
From extremist religious weirdos

652
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:38,144
The show that Alex is talking about here is the following

653
00:32:38,656 --> 00:32:44,800
So at least it's an actual show that was on are unlike other times you complained about Pilots that never got picked up as if they're like

654
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:50,432
I went read the article on Infowars about this from Kurt Nimmo

655
00:32:50,688 --> 00:32:51,968
But Alex is reporting on

656
00:32:52,224 --> 00:32:52,736
Edit start

657
00:32:53,248 --> 00:32:53,760
Week

658
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:57,600
Actually it starts up too strong I would say

659
00:32:58,112 --> 00:33:00,928
Well yeah that way too strong

660
00:33:01,952 --> 00:33:02,464
Quote

661
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:08,864
Fox the Entertainment Network founded by Rupert Murdoch and Barry Diller is working with the federal government at the Southern Poverty Law

662
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:13,472
Americans identified themselves as constitutional

663
00:33:13,728 --> 00:33:14,240
Wow

664
00:33:15,008 --> 00:33:16,288
This is a devastatingly

665
00:33:16,544 --> 00:33:17,568
Terribly paragraph

666
00:33:17,824 --> 00:33:19,616
I would never write this

667
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:22,688
In any website with an actual editor would never publish

668
00:33:22,944 --> 00:33:23,712
And here's why

669
00:33:24,224 --> 00:33:26,272
It's fighting off of way more than the article

670
00:33:26,528 --> 00:33:27,040
Continue

671
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:31,392
That paragraph is explicitly saying that this article will report

672
00:33:31,904 --> 00:33:33,440
The splc is working with fox

673
00:33:33,952 --> 00:33:36,256
The federal government is working with socks

674
00:33:36,512 --> 00:33:40,096
These groups are specifically working with Fox on issues related to

675
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:40,864
Contact

676
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:41,632
And for

677
00:33:41,888 --> 00:33:44,448
The work they're doing is specifically to demonize concert

678
00:33:45,984 --> 00:33:52,128
Do you have any idea how much work that dum-dum curtain if I was going to have to do to actually make this article match that lead parrot

679
00:33:52,384 --> 00:33:57,760
How dare you the answer is put a. At the end of that paragraph and called

680
00:33:58,016 --> 00:34:00,832
Go to lunch

681
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:06,976
He's going to have to demonstrate actual coordination or involve the splc's federal government in Fox

682
00:34:07,232 --> 00:34:07,744
But guess what

683
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,792
Even if he somehow manages to do that

684
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:10,560
He still has

685
00:34:10,816 --> 00:34:14,400
To prove that this work has anything to do with the following and the content

686
00:34:14,656 --> 00:34:15,424
In that show

687
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:19,264
There's literally no way that anyone in forwards has the journalism or research

688
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:21,056
Chops to pull something like that off

689
00:34:21,568 --> 00:34:25,152
Just pathetic all right so I assume that Nimoy

690
00:34:25,408 --> 00:34:27,456
Immediately filed

691
00:34:27,712 --> 00:34:32,576
Immediate

692
00:34:32,832 --> 00:34:33,856
We need emails

693
00:34:34,112 --> 00:34:34,624
Between

694
00:34:35,648 --> 00:34:38,720
Producers the producers of the show

695
00:34:38,976 --> 00:34:43,328
How do I get to goes all the way to the top let's just go to the president

696
00:34:43,584 --> 00:34:45,120
We need it all

697
00:34:45,376 --> 00:34:48,448
He didn't he didn't copy and paste

698
00:34:49,472 --> 00:34:55,616
About to eat my acropora and how are play for the pilot of a comedy show on are called we hate Paul Revere

699
00:34:56,128 --> 00:34:57,920
And they don't mention that it's

700
00:34:58,176 --> 00:34:58,688
Was never

701
00:34:58,944 --> 00:34:59,968
Actually on the show

702
00:35:00,224 --> 00:35:01,760
It's just all that standard bulshit

703
00:35:02,528 --> 00:35:06,368
But the bigger issue here is that this isn't about the entire series

704
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,928
It's just about one episode of

705
00:35:09,184 --> 00:35:09,696
The following

706
00:35:09,952 --> 00:35:12,768
And this gripe that he has

707
00:35:13,024 --> 00:35:13,536
Walking Hilaire

708
00:35:14,304 --> 00:35:14,816
Quote

709
00:35:15,072 --> 00:35:19,680
Any news on Thursday to recruits are asked

710
00:35:19,936 --> 00:35:20,704
Guitar ex-military

711
00:35:21,216 --> 00:35:24,032
They respond by saying they were raised in a militia in our quote

712
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:25,312
Constitutional extremists

713
00:35:26,336 --> 00:35:26,848
First

714
00:35:27,104 --> 00:35:29,664
You got the name of their own show wrong

715
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:34,528
If the important

716
00:35:35,296 --> 00:35:39,648
Mark's it's real bad

717
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:40,672
Second problem

718
00:35:40,928 --> 00:35:41,696
That's it

719
00:35:42,208 --> 00:35:44,000
Two characters mention that they work on

720
00:35:44,256 --> 00:35:45,792
Constitutional extremists in the response

721
00:35:46,304 --> 00:35:50,144
PLC federal government

722
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:56,544
I don't think there's any other explanation

723
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:01,664
Massive conspiracy because they felt that for a little

724
00:36:02,176 --> 00:36:06,272
These people running around calling people snowflakes all the time for not putting up with racist

725
00:36:06,528 --> 00:36:07,296
Sexist bullying

726
00:36:07,552 --> 00:36:08,832
These are people who are into the

727
00:36:09,344 --> 00:36:10,368
Exchange of ideas

728
00:36:11,136 --> 00:36:11,904
Absolutist

729
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:14,720
And yet here Alex is legitimately saying on his show that

730
00:36:14,976 --> 00:36:15,744
Free Society

731
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:22,144
A show like The Following wouldn't exist because it makes his extremist buddies feel bad

732
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,680
Marilee of coward liar

733
00:36:25,472 --> 00:36:27,264
There's a profoundly bad take on Alex

734
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:33,152
He can't prove that the sblc in federal government is responsible for this

735
00:36:33,408 --> 00:36:33,920
Probably like

736
00:36:34,432 --> 00:36:35,968
10 seconds and one episode of The Following

737
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:39,040
Memo write a shity article

738
00:36:39,296 --> 00:36:40,320
Pretending to demonstrate

739
00:36:41,088 --> 00:36:46,976
Then Alex can get on his radio show and talked about Infowars is reporting that the sblc is demonizing Constitution

740
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:54,144
Sick loop-the-loop of live version of the 24

741
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:54,912
For our Fox

742
00:36:55,168 --> 00:36:57,216
Machine where the morning show has

743
00:36:57,472 --> 00:37:03,616
Monday evening news

744
00:37:06,176 --> 00:37:07,712
It is but it's so much more

745
00:37:08,992 --> 00:37:11,040
It's more nefarious yes

746
00:37:12,576 --> 00:37:13,600
Call Alex

747
00:37:17,184 --> 00:37:19,744
I don't think anyone would take the

748
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,816
The time

749
00:37:23,584 --> 00:37:25,120
It's really an insult

750
00:37:25,632 --> 00:37:26,144
Or anything

751
00:37:27,424 --> 00:37:29,216
It's definitely like

752
00:37:29,728 --> 00:37:30,496
Real bad

753
00:37:33,056 --> 00:37:34,080
Hate to make it even worse

754
00:37:34,336 --> 00:37:35,104
This is so funny

755
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:37,664
Probably only bring this up cuz I had to read

756
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:41,248
Need an actual Infowars article and like when you do you find s*** like this

757
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:42,272
Pathetic

758
00:37:42,528 --> 00:37:43,808
Listen to this

759
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,600
Axel paragraph

760
00:37:45,856 --> 00:37:47,648
Real article

761
00:37:48,672 --> 00:37:49,184
Quote

762

Expert

778
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:53,184
Did they consulted about what shows his wife that is

Basketball today

You start

783
00:39:00,864 --> 00:39:01,632
Question

784
00:39:02,144 --> 00:39:02,912
How rigorous

785
00:39:03,168 --> 00:39:03,936
Is any process for

786
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:12,384
Strong if this is okay I really like them being able to

787
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:15,200
I really like them just like

788
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:19,808
It would make

789
00:39:20,064 --> 00:39:21,600
If they had the headline and then

790
00:39:21,856 --> 00:39:22,368
Just a series of a

791
00:39:23,136 --> 00:39:24,160
Like that would be

792
00:39:24,416 --> 00:39:25,184
It's the same thing

793
00:39:26,208 --> 00:39:29,024
Patriots

794
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:32,864
We are now reporting

795
00:39:33,888 --> 00:39:36,704
Alex Jones across the hall

796
00:39:37,216 --> 00:39:39,264
Yeah

797
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:40,288
It's embarrassing

798
00:39:41,056 --> 00:39:44,128
So on this 31st year this Sunday Easter

799
00:39:44,384 --> 00:39:46,432
Joe Alex goes out to break

800
00:39:46,688 --> 00:39:47,456
The first commercial break

801
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:48,480
Like that

802
00:39:55,648 --> 00:39:56,416
Enterprise

803
00:39:56,672 --> 00:39:58,720
It's a Sprite

804
00:39:58,976 --> 00:39:59,488
And guess what

805
00:39:59,744 --> 00:40:00,512
Then it just goes to

806
00:40:00,768 --> 00:40:01,280
Rebroadcast

807
00:40:01,536 --> 00:40:03,840
What is Coachella

808
00:40:04,096 --> 00:40:07,424
Alex didn't work on

809
00:40:07,936 --> 00:40:08,960
He did take Easter off

810
00:40:09,216 --> 00:40:14,336
So what happened with you recorded that on Friday know what special guest

811
00:40:14,592 --> 00:40:15,872
They were going to replay

812
00:40:16,384 --> 00:40:17,920
What interview they're going to replay

813
00:40:18,176 --> 00:40:18,688
And so he

814
00:40:18,944 --> 00:40:19,712
That

815
00:40:19,968 --> 00:40:24,832
Adidas recorded that like 5 minutes on Friday or whatever and they took the weekend off

816
00:40:25,856 --> 00:40:26,880
F****** a******

817
00:40:27,136 --> 00:40:30,720
Klipsch heresies Ted Nugent

818
00:40:30,976 --> 00:40:32,512
Which is like God

819
00:40:33,024 --> 00:40:35,328
Just complaining about to Jim Carrey

820
00:40:35,584 --> 00:40:38,912
And then he has an interview that he did a while back with John rap

821
00:40:39,168 --> 00:40:40,704
Report about how

822
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:41,984
James Holmes

823
00:40:42,496 --> 00:40:44,544
Amazon mind control

824
00:40:45,312 --> 00:40:46,336
So you to April 1st

825
00:40:50,944 --> 00:40:51,456
Real quick

826
00:40:52,224 --> 00:40:58,368
April 1st 2013 I am your host Alex Jones going to be live here

827
00:41:10,656 --> 00:41:12,960
I asked him a few questions during that.

828
00:41:13,472 --> 00:41:15,008
Steve pieczenik is back already

829
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:21,408
Cbp's back after a weekend a couple Days Inn

830
00:41:21,664 --> 00:41:24,480
Alex

831
00:41:24,736 --> 00:41:29,088
Express that he does not agree with that

832
00:41:29,344 --> 00:41:30,624
Look at these back.

833
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:34,464
Talk about it for an hour

834
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:36,512
Stone cave where he was

835
00:41:36,768 --> 00:41:37,280
Kept

836
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:42,144
These back to bring Salvation to Alex Jones

837
00:41:42,912 --> 00:41:43,424
Perhaps

838
00:41:43,936 --> 00:41:47,520
So I started to listen to this episode and I started to feel like

839
00:41:48,288 --> 00:41:49,056
This is

840
00:41:49,312 --> 00:41:50,080
So familiar

841
00:41:50,848 --> 00:41:51,616
Has like

842
00:41:51,872 --> 00:41:52,895
Heard this episode

843
00:41:54,175 --> 00:41:58,527
And I knew for sure that I had heard it before it got to Alex Garden

844
00:41:58,783 --> 00:41:59,551
Nutella story

845
00:41:59,807 --> 00:42:01,343
About how over the weekend

846
00:42:01,855 --> 00:42:03,903
He got yelled at by a global Asuna

847
00:42:04,415 --> 00:42:10,559
This is it is we have covered this episode already

848
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:14,399
I got about 40 minutes into the episode

849
00:42:14,655 --> 00:42:15,167
This camp

850
00:42:15,423 --> 00:42:19,007
Be another time that there's a globalist in the hot tub

851
00:42:22,335 --> 00:42:24,639
Salvage yard

852
00:42:27,455 --> 00:42:29,759
I went back and I looked

853
00:42:30,015 --> 00:42:30,527
Cover this song

854
00:42:31,039 --> 00:42:32,831
Why have I already heard today

855
00:42:33,087 --> 00:42:35,391
A couple years back

856
00:42:35,903 --> 00:42:37,439
When I was trying to find

857
00:42:37,695 --> 00:42:38,463
The topic to cover

858
00:42:43,071 --> 00:42:44,095
What was

859
00:42:44,351 --> 00:42:47,935
I went back and I listened to every April Fools

860
00:42:48,703 --> 00:42:54,847
Cuz I thought that maybe Alex would do a joke show I heard this music

861
00:42:55,359 --> 00:43:01,503
But the next episode after that found the globalist hot tub story as like we got it.

862
00:43:01,759 --> 00:43:07,903
So if you want you can go back and listen to our April first and second episode

863
00:43:08,159 --> 00:43:12,767
Where it's mostly about Alex running into a authoritarian globalist

864
00:43:13,023 --> 00:43:15,327
Who is into white genocide

865
00:43:15,583 --> 00:43:16,863
Who yelled at Alex

866
00:43:19,679 --> 00:43:24,543
For 20 minutes 20 minutes

867
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:26,847
The Fantasticks

868
00:43:27,103 --> 00:43:29,407
I realize that like we'd already covered

869
00:43:31,199 --> 00:43:32,223
S*** what do I do

870
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:35,807
Do I just say everyone go listen to that episode I were done

871
00:43:38,111 --> 00:43:38,623
Listen to that episode

872
00:43:39,391 --> 00:43:41,183
And I realize they like

873
00:43:41,439 --> 00:43:41,951
Play covered in that

874
00:43:42,207 --> 00:43:42,975
Was the Robeson

875
00:43:43,231 --> 00:43:44,511
And there's more going on here

876
00:43:45,023 --> 00:43:46,559
So what

877
00:43:46,815 --> 00:43:48,095
I'm going to look at the other stuff

878
00:43:48,351 --> 00:43:48,863
The globalist

879
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:50,911
Hot tub stuff that's in the other episode

880
00:43:51,167 --> 00:43:53,215
We will take a look at all the other stuff

881
00:43:53,471 --> 00:43:54,751
It's important for our

882
00:43:55,007 --> 00:43:56,031
Continuing investigation

883
00:43:56,287 --> 00:43:56,799
2013

884
00:43:57,567 --> 00:43:59,615
But unfortunately involved

885
00:44:00,127 --> 00:44:00,639
Republican

886
00:44:01,151 --> 00:44:01,663
Globalist

887
00:44:02,175 --> 00:44:02,687
Hot tub I think

888
00:44:03,711 --> 00:44:04,735
Sequel to hobo with a

889
00:44:05,503 --> 00:44:07,295
Do you remember that Electric Power

890
00:44:07,807 --> 00:44:08,575
I think that was pretty much

891
00:44:10,367 --> 00:44:13,439
The point out the Globus in a hot tub

892
00:44:13,695 --> 00:44:14,463
Because it's

893
00:44:15,743 --> 00:44:17,023
It puts us in a really bad

894
00:44:18,047 --> 00:44:19,071
He is really depressed

895
00:44:19,583 --> 00:44:20,863
And really messed up

896
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:21,631
About

897
00:44:21,887 --> 00:44:23,167
Running into this authoritarian

898
00:44:28,799 --> 00:44:30,079
Certainly not

899
00:44:30,847 --> 00:44:32,639
So he's in a very f*****-up

900
00:44:33,407 --> 00:44:35,711
Really bad position

901
00:44:36,223 --> 00:44:37,503
To interact with

902
00:44:38,015 --> 00:44:38,783
A psych Warfare

903
00:44:39,039 --> 00:44:39,807
Man

904
00:44:40,063 --> 00:44:41,087
And I love it when they're hate

905
00:44:42,367 --> 00:44:44,671
So we got as we get to it

906
00:44:44,927 --> 00:44:46,463
But before that

907
00:44:49,279 --> 00:44:50,303
He continues are running Joe

908
00:44:53,631 --> 00:44:55,423
Thomas Jefferson

909
00:45:00,543 --> 00:45:01,311
What

910
00:45:02,847 --> 00:45:06,687
God damn it I don't think that's an actual Thomas Jefferson quote

911
00:45:06,943 --> 00:45:08,991
Literally

912
00:45:09,247 --> 00:45:09,759
Never said it

913
00:45:10,015 --> 00:45:11,295
Searching through sources ranging

914
00:45:11,551 --> 00:45:15,391
Jeffersonian archives

915
00:45:15,903 --> 00:45:17,695
This doesn't appear in any recorded

916
00:45:17,951 --> 00:45:18,463
Midstate Motorsports

917
00:45:20,255 --> 00:45:23,327
To off-base for something Jefferson

918
00:45:24,095 --> 00:45:25,119
It's just that there's no evidence

919
00:45:25,375 --> 00:45:25,887
He did say it

920
00:45:26,655 --> 00:45:27,167
However

921
00:45:27,423 --> 00:45:31,007
It does sound a lot like a boiled down version of someone else's words

922
00:45:32,543 --> 00:45:38,431
What a people will submit to and you found out the exact amount of Injustice and wrong which will be imposed

923
00:45:38,943 --> 00:45:43,295
If these will continue until their resisted with either words or blows or with both

924
00:45:43,807 --> 00:45:47,647
The limits of tyrants are prescribed by the endurance of Those whom they oppress

925
00:45:48,927 --> 00:45:50,463
This was set on August 4th 18th

926
00:45:50,719 --> 00:45:52,767
57 by noted radical abolitionist

927
00:45:53,023 --> 00:45:53,791
Frederick Douglass

928
00:45:54,559 --> 00:45:56,863
Is wild to me because obviously Alex likes

929
00:45:58,143 --> 00:46:01,471
Quote for some reason he doesn't know that he's reciting quotes

930
00:46:01,727 --> 00:46:02,495
Specifically about the

931
00:46:02,751 --> 00:46:03,775
The ending of slavery

932
00:46:04,031 --> 00:46:04,799
Which is something is

933
00:46:05,055 --> 00:46:07,103
Family members literally fought to maintain

934
00:46:08,383 --> 00:46:09,919
You're making assumptions

935
00:46:10,687 --> 00:46:11,711
The next line

936
00:46:12,735 --> 00:46:17,599
In the light of these ideas Negroes will be hunted in the north and held and flog it at in the

937
00:46:17,855 --> 00:46:20,671
The South so long as they submit to those devilish outrageous

938
00:46:20,927 --> 00:46:21,951
And make no resistance

939
00:46:22,207 --> 00:46:23,231
It's either moral or physical

940
00:46:23,999 --> 00:46:27,839
Men may not get all they pay for in this world but they must certainly pay for all they go

941
00:46:28,607 --> 00:46:31,423
If we ever get freedom from the oppression and Wrongs heaped upon us

942
00:46:31,679 --> 00:46:32,959
We must pay for their removal

943
00:46:33,471 --> 00:46:36,031
Will do this by labor by suffering by sacrifice

944
00:46:36,287 --> 00:46:38,591
And if need be by our lives in the lives of others

945
00:46:39,615 --> 00:46:41,663
Most of the time Alex is fake Jefferson

946
00:46:41,919 --> 00:46:42,431
Quotes are just

947
00:46:43,711 --> 00:46:44,223
Their examples

948
00:46:44,479 --> 00:46:46,527
I'm seeing a meme on a patriot message board

949
00:46:46,783 --> 00:46:47,295
It's real

950
00:46:47,807 --> 00:46:48,319
Huskies field

951
00:46:48,575 --> 00:46:49,087
Grocer

952
00:46:49,343 --> 00:46:50,623
As if what's going on isn't it

953
00:46:51,135 --> 00:46:52,671
You Frederick douglass's words

954
00:46:52,927 --> 00:46:53,695
And attribute them to

955
00:46:53,951 --> 00:46:55,999
Someone at school with your audience

956
00:46:56,255 --> 00:46:56,767
Quotes

957
00:46:57,023 --> 00:46:59,071
Maybe I'm reading too much into this maybe more than I

958
00:47:02,399 --> 00:47:03,423
But whatever the case

959
00:47:03,935 --> 00:47:04,703
Streak of not knowing anything

960
00:47:04,959 --> 00:47:06,239
His favorite subject

961
00:47:07,775 --> 00:47:08,287
Still going

962
00:47:08,799 --> 00:47:10,847
Impaled

963
00:47:12,383 --> 00:47:13,663
Really messed up

964
00:47:13,919 --> 00:47:14,431
Ted Williams

965
00:47:14,943 --> 00:47:15,455
Not knowing any

966
00:47:15,711 --> 00:47:16,223
Anything about Thomas

967
00:47:17,503 --> 00:47:18,015
Kind of amazed

968
00:47:18,783 --> 00:47:23,391
No one will ever be 256 quote

969
00:47:23,647 --> 00:47:24,415
Monovalent

970
00:47:24,927 --> 00:47:26,463
Does bmore messed up to me

971
00:47:26,719 --> 00:47:32,607
What black people say

972
00:47:36,191 --> 00:47:36,959
Frederick Douglass

973
00:47:37,471 --> 00:47:37,983
Smart guy

974
00:47:38,239 --> 00:47:41,823
Going to have to go

975
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:43,359
The Thomas Jefferson everything is

976
00:47:43,615 --> 00:47:44,383
F****** Jefferson

977
00:47:44,639 --> 00:47:45,663
If it sounds good

978
00:47:50,015 --> 00:47:51,295
Cuz there's no way you're going to say

979
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:54,623
Diseases ancestor

980
00:47:55,903 --> 00:47:58,463
Relearn something without linking a little bit later

981
00:47:58,975 --> 00:48:00,255
So

982
00:48:00,511 --> 00:48:02,815
Text Cliff we get a server continuation of Alex

983
00:48:03,071 --> 00:48:04,351
Delusions of grandeur

984
00:48:05,887 --> 00:48:07,167
Beginning this episode we heard him

985
00:48:07,423 --> 00:48:11,263
Arguing the Kim Jong and because Alex

986
00:48:11,519 --> 00:48:13,055
Getting out of pocket

987
00:48:13,311 --> 00:48:14,847
Kim Jeong Hoon

988
00:48:15,103 --> 00:48:16,639
That's the only thing

989
00:48:17,151 --> 00:48:18,943
Alex has another indication

990
00:48:19,711 --> 00:48:20,479
Is geopolitical

991
00:48:20,735 --> 00:48:21,247
Important

992
00:48:24,831 --> 00:48:28,927
Different

993
00:48:57,343 --> 00:48:58,111
Smells like

994
00:49:03,231 --> 00:49:03,999
What we know

995
00:49:04,255 --> 00:49:06,815
Is the is former CFL

996
00:49:07,327 --> 00:49:09,119
We know that he's somebody talks

997
00:49:10,143 --> 00:49:11,423
We know that you somebody like that

998
00:49:11,679 --> 00:49:14,495
The strategy of buttering up Alex with flattery

999
00:49:15,007 --> 00:49:17,823
Like something that Steve is telling Alex

1000
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:22,687
I go to these high-level meetings and everyone's a huge fan but you're right on

1001
00:49:22,943 --> 00:49:23,711
They say that you

1002
00:49:23,967 --> 00:49:26,783
Dear God you're there to tell people the truth

1003
00:49:27,295 --> 00:49:30,367
That to me is right in line with the kind of b*******

1004
00:49:30,879 --> 00:49:31,647
Hotel hourly

1005
00:49:31,903 --> 00:49:33,439
To ingratiate himself

1006
00:49:33,695 --> 00:49:34,463
And you know how

1007
00:49:35,999 --> 00:49:36,511
Scuse me

1008
00:49:37,791 --> 00:49:42,655
I just choked ironically I

1009
00:49:43,679 --> 00:49:44,703
It's so

1010
00:49:45,215 --> 00:49:46,751
It's so funny to baby

1011
00:49:47,263 --> 00:49:48,031
Alex has

1012
00:49:48,287 --> 00:49:48,799
The ark

1013
00:49:49,311 --> 00:49:50,335
For Wyatt

1014
00:49:50,591 --> 00:49:51,103
Not true

1015
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:51,871
On his lips

1016
00:49:52,639 --> 00:49:56,735
He's saying literally you guys listen to me and you're saying you don't know what to do

1017
00:49:56,991 --> 00:50:03,135
I'm telling you what to do what are you talkin about yourself why are you doing this

1018
00:50:07,999 --> 00:50:08,767
I'll tell you why I

1019
00:50:09,791 --> 00:50:12,095
Cuz they're not actually

1020
00:50:12,351 --> 00:50:13,375
You know why

1021
00:50:13,631 --> 00:50:16,447
I listen to this s*** this terrible showare like

1022
00:50:16,703 --> 00:50:17,215
Flies

1023
00:50:17,727 --> 00:50:19,519
Leon

1024
00:50:19,775 --> 00:50:20,287
Easter

1025
00:50:20,543 --> 00:50:26,687
Cover an article that you're the primary source for about 10 seconds and a fox show were you allege that the

1026
00:50:26,943 --> 00:50:28,735
Splc in the federal government of running

1027
00:50:29,759 --> 00:50:30,783
Drama contact

1028
00:50:31,295 --> 00:50:37,439
Like you running that kind of a joke of a f****** show world leaders

1029
00:50:38,719 --> 00:50:41,279
Skip.

1030
00:50:41,791 --> 00:50:42,815
They're like what

1031
00:50:43,071 --> 00:50:45,631
Else is Alex's wife

1032
00:50:51,519 --> 00:50:57,663
Realistic explanation is that Steve is telling them that it's a complete lie from somebody because he sounds

1033
00:50:58,175 --> 00:50:59,967
He believes it and it's not something that he

1034
00:51:00,735 --> 00:51:01,503
Absolutely

1035
00:51:03,551 --> 00:51:05,343
I heard that in a

1036
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:11,743
Immediately my Steve bell went off

1037
00:51:11,999 --> 00:51:12,767
Pieczenik

1038
00:51:13,023 --> 00:51:16,095
He brought up CFR brought of talking to high-level peep

1039
00:51:17,631 --> 00:51:21,215
It's too it's too exactly in line with the manipulation we send

1040
00:51:21,471 --> 00:51:23,007
Steve Hughes on Alex

1041
00:51:23,519 --> 00:51:27,103
There's only one other high-level

1042
00:51:27,359 --> 00:51:28,383
And he's not going to show up for another

1043
00:51:29,151 --> 00:51:31,455
True

1044
00:51:31,711 --> 00:51:34,015
Rodger Stone

1045
00:51:34,271 --> 00:51:35,551
They didn't become friends

1046
00:51:35,807 --> 00:51:36,575
I did not know that

1047
00:51:36,831 --> 00:51:38,879
That's where they that's where their pads first

1048
00:51:39,135 --> 00:51:39,903
Allegedly cross

1049
00:51:40,927 --> 00:51:43,231
I'm so Alex would say something that

1050
00:51:46,815 --> 00:51:48,351
About his awareness

1051
00:51:48,607 --> 00:51:49,119
About his Auto

1052
00:51:50,399 --> 00:51:54,495
And the only reason we have any wealth or money order

1053
00:51:54,751 --> 00:51:56,031
Is because

1054
00:52:21,631 --> 00:52:27,263
Which five

1055
00:52:38,783 --> 00:52:43,647
They are playing the game like

1056
00:52:46,463 --> 00:52:48,255
Exist

1057
00:52:48,511 --> 00:52:49,023
Prevalent

1058
00:52:49,279 --> 00:52:51,839
No is it like individual teeth

1059
00:52:52,095 --> 00:52:55,423
Press X and all teeth are removed

1060
00:52:55,679 --> 00:52:56,191
Same time that's a

1061
00:52:56,447 --> 00:53:00,799
Shawty construction of the game

1062
00:53:01,055 --> 00:53:03,359
Is emission

1063
00:53:04,383 --> 00:53:05,663
So I found a top

1064
00:53:05,919 --> 00:53:08,991
100 video games

1065
00:53:09,247 --> 00:53:10,015
2013

1066
00:53:10,271 --> 00:53:11,551
And I'm not sure

1067
00:53:12,831 --> 00:53:13,343
In here

1068
00:53:13,855 --> 00:53:16,671
The top selling game of 2013

1069
00:53:16,927 --> 00:53:19,487
And I can definitely see Alex taking issue with that game from like a

1070
00:53:19,743 --> 00:53:21,279
The puritanical standpoint

1071
00:53:21,535 --> 00:53:23,071
He wasn't about training

1072
00:53:23,583 --> 00:53:24,351
Patero Patriots

1073
00:53:26,655 --> 00:53:31,007
Number two on the list is FIFA

1074
00:53:31,263 --> 00:53:37,407
Could be as an American

1075
00:53:39,711 --> 00:53:41,759
Number three is Call of Duty ghosts

1076
00:53:42,015 --> 00:53:46,367
Phone number for is Battlefield 4 which are both pretty solidly America Centric military

1077
00:53:46,623 --> 00:53:47,135
Freestyle

1078
00:53:47,647 --> 00:53:48,671
Number 5 is assassins

1079
00:53:48,927 --> 00:53:50,975
Creed Black Flag which is about Pirates

1080
00:53:51,231 --> 00:53:51,743
Number 6

1081
00:53:51,999 --> 00:53:54,815
Tomb Raider number seven is the previous year's edition of

1082
00:53:55,071 --> 00:53:57,887
FIFA number 8 is Lego Marvel super

1083
00:53:58,143 --> 00:53:58,911
Heroes never die

1084
00:54:00,191 --> 00:54:01,215
The number 10 is lasted

1085
00:54:01,983 --> 00:54:05,055
None of these games come close to describing the sort of game Alex

1086
00:54:05,567 --> 00:54:06,591
Is imagining.

1087
00:54:07,103 --> 00:54:11,199
I should admit for full disclosure IM played any of the games on the top 100

1088
00:54:11,455 --> 00:54:12,479
Except probably Luigi

1089
00:54:12,735 --> 00:54:18,879
These Mansion 2 tortured people because they love to yell about private property in the freezer

1090
00:54:19,135 --> 00:54:19,903
Market

1091
00:54:20,159 --> 00:54:20,671
Sound right

1092
00:54:22,207 --> 00:54:22,975
This is Alex

1093
00:54:23,231 --> 00:54:23,999
Text being dumb and

1094
00:54:24,767 --> 00:54:26,559
But also knowing that is audience

1095
00:54:26,815 --> 00:54:27,327
Gullible

1096
00:54:27,583 --> 00:54:28,095
An old

1097
00:54:28,351 --> 00:54:31,423
Keurig I say that all the top video games are about teaching kids

1098
00:54:31,679 --> 00:54:32,191
Torture

1099
00:54:32,703 --> 00:54:34,239
All I really hear is a guy

1100
00:54:34,495 --> 00:54:35,007
Indicating that he

1101
00:54:35,263 --> 00:54:36,287
He knows that is demographic

1102
00:54:36,543 --> 00:54:38,079
Don't include people under 40

1103
00:54:38,847 --> 00:54:41,407
More I think about it the more I think there's a very good chance

1104
00:54:41,663 --> 00:54:42,943
Alex would have been the sort of guy

1105
00:54:43,199 --> 00:54:49,343
Back in the day would have been like in rock and roll

1106
00:54:50,623 --> 00:54:54,719
Like what are the kids doing

1107
00:54:57,279 --> 00:54:59,583
It's just it's just a man being out of touch

1108
00:54:59,839 --> 00:55:00,607
The Next Generation

1109
00:55:04,959 --> 00:55:05,983
Knowing that

1110
00:55:06,239 --> 00:55:07,775
Pressing that out of touch

1111
00:55:08,287 --> 00:55:11,359
Aggressive

1112
00:55:11,615 --> 00:55:13,663
Anybody was listening is

1113
00:55:13,919 --> 00:55:15,199
Like someone

1114
00:55:15,711 --> 00:55:16,479
Video games

1115
00:55:18,783 --> 00:55:19,807
What's the cost

1116
00:55:20,063 --> 00:55:20,831
Just taking that line

1117
00:55:21,599 --> 00:55:23,391
You've got like old man house phone

1118
00:55:23,647 --> 00:55:27,231
Yeah it's not like anything about the current state of

1119
00:55:27,487 --> 00:55:33,119
Modern console games

1120
00:55:36,703 --> 00:55:37,471
Serious

1121
00:55:37,983 --> 00:55:39,519
Kind of

1122
00:55:39,775 --> 00:55:40,287
In the Fallout game

1123
00:55:40,543 --> 00:55:41,055
Games where it's like

1124
00:55:41,311 --> 00:55:43,615
Look at where Nationals propaganda will get

1125
00:55:44,127 --> 00:55:44,639
That kind of thing

1126
00:55:45,407 --> 00:55:46,943
I could see that maybe

1127
00:55:48,223 --> 00:55:49,759
Baby but that doesn't mean that like

1128
00:55:50,271 --> 00:55:52,319
Find a real life

1129
00:55:52,575 --> 00:55:55,391
Example of

1130
00:55:55,647 --> 00:56:01,023
Yeah probably is one the video game

1131
00:56:01,279 --> 00:56:02,047
To be able to like

1132
00:56:02,303 --> 00:56:04,351
Pinpoint what you probably talk about

1133
00:56:04,607 --> 00:56:05,631
But even if you prove

1134
00:56:07,167 --> 00:56:08,959
Game that's similar to

1135
00:56:09,215 --> 00:56:09,727
I'm about

1136
00:56:09,983 --> 00:56:11,519
He still has failed to prove his thesis

1137
00:56:11,775 --> 00:56:15,871
That is all there's so many of these games it's all about it's in the culture

1138
00:56:16,127 --> 00:56:20,479
You have 10 seconds of an episode of the following you're complaining about I don't believe you

1139
00:56:25,087 --> 00:56:25,855
Pcgamer

1140
00:56:26,111 --> 00:56:26,623
What are we

1141
00:56:26,879 --> 00:56:27,647
Atari

1142
00:56:30,463 --> 00:56:30,975
The GameCube

1143
00:56:35,327 --> 00:56:37,631
2 time I'm noticing a lot of different

1144
00:56:38,399 --> 00:56:39,679
One of them is the

1145
00:56:40,191 --> 00:56:41,983
Heightened prevalence of Alex

1146
00:56:42,239 --> 00:56:42,751
Things are actor

1147
00:56:43,007 --> 00:56:45,311
Another one that I'm noticing

1148
00:56:45,567 --> 00:56:46,335
Quite a bit

1149
00:56:46,591 --> 00:56:47,359
The troubles

1150
00:56:47,615 --> 00:56:48,895
Maybe

1151
00:56:51,455 --> 00:56:52,991
Is a lot of colors

1152
00:56:53,247 --> 00:56:55,295
Seem to be calling and expressing alienation

1153
00:56:55,807 --> 00:56:56,575
The people around them

1154
00:56:56,831 --> 00:56:58,367
Because of Alex

1155
00:56:58,879 --> 00:57:00,159
And we've seen him respond

1156
00:57:00,415 --> 00:57:00,927
Pretty

1157
00:57:02,719 --> 00:57:03,743
Episode

1158
00:57:03,999 --> 00:57:07,071
But in this next clip we see another caller expressing

1159
00:57:07,327 --> 00:57:07,839
Pretty much

1160
00:57:08,095 --> 00:57:09,119
Exactly the same thing

1161
00:57:09,375 --> 00:57:11,167
It's like now that I've woken up

1162
00:57:11,679 --> 00:57:14,495
People around me don't agree with me anymore

1163
00:57:14,751 --> 00:57:16,543
And the hostility that Alex

1164
00:57:16,799 --> 00:57:17,567
Expresses towards

1165
00:57:18,079 --> 00:57:19,359
People in the collars life

1166
00:57:19,615 --> 00:57:20,895
I think it's so

1167
00:57:21,919 --> 00:57:25,759
Pennsylvania

1168
00:57:26,527 --> 00:57:27,295
Hey Alex

1169
00:57:27,551 --> 00:57:30,623
Huge fan I just wanted to ask you

1170
00:57:30,879 --> 00:57:33,183
Approach people with this information I mean

1171
00:57:33,439 --> 00:57:35,487
I get ridiculed I get laughed at

1172
00:57:35,743 --> 00:57:41,887
People think I'm crazy

1173
00:57:54,687 --> 00:57:58,271
Organize

1174
00:57:59,807 --> 00:58:01,087
Yeah it's

1175
00:58:01,599 --> 00:58:05,695
I just want to also tell you I'll let you know you really touched my life for the positive

1176
00:58:06,207 --> 00:58:10,047
Wow you can't say but you can't do both of those things back to back

1177
00:58:10,815 --> 00:58:11,327
Alex

1178
00:58:11,839 --> 00:58:15,423
No one wants to talk to me and I get made fun of all the time because of

1179
00:58:15,679 --> 00:58:17,983
Cuz the ideas that I repeat that you have

1180
00:58:18,239 --> 00:58:18,751
Next

1181
00:58:19,519 --> 00:58:21,567
You really made a positive influence

1182
00:58:21,823 --> 00:58:27,967
Know you know that is sort of indicative of Stockholm Syndrome

1183
00:58:28,223 --> 00:58:29,247
Yes

1184
00:58:31,039 --> 00:58:32,319
It does seem like there is a

1185
00:58:32,831 --> 00:58:34,879
Where it is possible to

1186
00:58:35,135 --> 00:58:35,647
Interpret

1187
00:58:35,903 --> 00:58:38,463
Like as long as you have the veneer of martyrdom

1188
00:58:38,719 --> 00:58:40,255
To whatever people are doing

1189
00:58:40,511 --> 00:58:42,303
To you it is still possible for someone

1190
00:58:42,559 --> 00:58:43,327
How to destroy your life

1191
00:58:43,583 --> 00:58:46,655
Can you still see it as an absolute

1192
00:58:46,911 --> 00:58:48,191
It's so wrong of Alex

1193
00:58:50,239 --> 00:58:50,751
He's not

1194
00:58:51,007 --> 00:58:52,031
Hurting people

1195
00:58:52,287 --> 00:58:54,335
If you get a bunch of calls for

1196
00:58:54,591 --> 00:58:55,615
From people who are saying like

1197
00:58:56,127 --> 00:58:58,175
What you have made me believe

1198
00:58:58,687 --> 00:58:59,711
Has really

1199
00:58:59,967 --> 00:59:00,991
Made it so no one

1200
00:59:01,503 --> 00:59:02,015
Communicate

1201
00:59:04,319 --> 00:59:05,087
Should take a look at

1202
00:59:05,855 --> 00:59:06,623
That's all I would

1203
00:59:07,903 --> 00:59:08,415
That's what I would say

1204
00:59:08,671 --> 00:59:09,183
Tyranny

1205
00:59:15,583 --> 00:59:17,887
Frederick Douglass Highway of Jefferson

1206
00:59:19,679 --> 00:59:23,519
Earlier I heard Alex high-level government

1207
00:59:28,639 --> 00:59:29,663
Alex

1208
00:59:29,919 --> 00:59:30,943
Confirm

1209
00:59:50,911 --> 00:59:57,055
Confirmation on that too

1210
00:59:57,311 --> 00:59:59,871
Remember that I level government

1211
01:00:06,015 --> 01:00:06,527
Alex

1212
01:00:06,783 --> 01:00:08,575
Is coming off this globalist in a hot tub

1213
01:00:10,367 --> 01:00:10,879
I need freedom

1214
01:00:11,647 --> 01:00:12,671
Because this guy

1215
01:00:12,927 --> 01:00:13,951
You know you really shook him

1216
01:00:15,999 --> 01:00:17,023
And Alex is really

1217
01:00:18,047 --> 01:00:19,071
And that's not good

1218
01:00:19,839 --> 01:00:20,351
Because Steve

1219
01:00:20,607 --> 01:00:22,911
Pieczenik for whatever crazy

1220
01:00:23,935 --> 01:00:24,703
For however

1221
01:00:24,959 --> 01:00:25,471
Munchies

1222
01:00:25,727 --> 01:00:28,287
Probably exaggerating a lot of

1223
01:00:29,311 --> 01:00:30,591
He definitely is

1224
01:00:31,103 --> 01:00:33,151
Someone who understands psychology

1225
01:00:35,967 --> 01:00:36,479
He has

1226
01:00:36,735 --> 01:00:39,039
Degrees in psychology

1227
01:00:39,295 --> 01:00:40,063
View psychiatry

1228
01:00:40,575 --> 01:00:41,599
Totino's

1229
01:00:42,111 --> 01:00:42,879
How to manipulate

1230
01:00:43,135 --> 01:00:44,927
People when they're vulnerable

1231
01:00:45,439 --> 01:00:47,743
Helicopter

1232
01:00:48,255 --> 01:00:50,047
He's not somebody that you want to talk

1233
01:00:50,303 --> 01:00:50,815
To win

1234
01:00:51,071 --> 01:00:51,583
You're not in

1235
01:00:51,839 --> 01:00:52,607
The good place

1236
01:00:53,119 --> 01:00:54,655
And so when I hear Alex

1237
01:00:54,911 --> 01:00:55,423
Introduce him

1238
01:00:55,679 --> 01:00:57,215
I feel like this is the worst

1239
01:00:59,007 --> 01:01:04,383
Doctor Steve

1240
01:01:11,807 --> 01:01:14,367
What is the psychology

1241
01:01:23,583 --> 01:01:25,375
They're celebrating

1242
01:01:25,887 --> 01:01:29,983
The Publix

1243
01:01:34,591 --> 01:01:36,895
Homeland Security

1244
01:01:46,367 --> 01:01:46,879
He's not the one

1245
01:01:47,647 --> 01:01:51,487
To talk about the truth but I can understand why you're feeling depressed

1246
01:01:51,743 --> 01:01:53,023
I am not

1247
01:01:53,791 --> 01:01:55,327
What we see there is a

1248
01:01:55,839 --> 01:01:59,423
Perfect setup for someone likes to eat

1249
01:01:59,679 --> 01:02:00,191
Uranus

1250
01:02:00,447 --> 01:02:01,471
Expert on this stuff

1251
01:02:01,727 --> 01:02:04,543
Depressed I'm feeling grief is a lot of real name

1252
01:02:04,799 --> 01:02:05,823
I'm coming

1253
01:02:06,079 --> 01:02:07,871
You shattered put the pieces back

1254
01:02:08,127 --> 01:02:09,151
Together in the way

1255
01:02:09,407 --> 01:02:11,199
That you see fit

1256
01:02:11,967 --> 01:02:12,479
And

1257
01:02:14,015 --> 01:02:14,527
Yeah

1258
01:02:14,783 --> 01:02:15,551
Cheese's here

1259
01:02:16,831 --> 01:02:20,159
You got the compliment in there without even without Force

1260
01:02:26,047 --> 01:02:26,559
Reframe

1261
01:02:27,071 --> 01:02:28,607
Depress

1262
01:02:29,119 --> 01:02:30,399
So you think about that

1263
01:02:30,655 --> 01:02:36,799
Allowed

1264
01:02:37,055 --> 01:02:37,823
The different package

1265
01:02:38,079 --> 01:02:39,615
That doesn't make me depressed

1266
01:02:39,871 --> 01:02:41,407
So if you see

1267
01:02:41,663 --> 01:02:43,455
You won't be depressed either either

1268
01:02:43,711 --> 01:02:48,575
And you don't want to feel bad anymore and the fascinating

1269
01:02:48,831 --> 01:02:52,671
Compliment also within the framework of

1270
01:02:52,927 --> 01:02:57,279
Why we've always gotten along a firm Connection in there

1271
01:02:57,535 --> 01:02:59,839
Mutual respect and working together

1272
01:03:00,095 --> 01:03:01,119
It's so

1273
01:03:01,887 --> 01:03:03,679
I don't know if

1274
01:03:03,935 --> 01:03:06,495
I don't know if this is muscle memory or if he's just

1275
01:03:06,751 --> 01:03:08,799
That girl

1276
01:03:12,383 --> 01:03:13,151
No that's okay

1277
01:03:14,431 --> 01:03:16,479
You are somebody who has a good amount of training

1278
01:03:16,991 --> 01:03:17,503
In the

1279
01:03:18,015 --> 01:03:20,575
Probably recognize little cues

1280
01:03:23,391 --> 01:03:27,231
No provide stimulus

1281
01:03:28,255 --> 01:03:29,023
That's it

1282
01:03:30,559 --> 01:03:31,071
So

1283
01:03:31,327 --> 01:03:31,839
Steve

1284
01:03:33,119 --> 01:03:34,399
Gets bright

1285
01:03:35,167 --> 01:03:36,191
He has some

1286
01:03:36,447 --> 01:03:37,727
Feelings about it

1287
01:03:41,055 --> 01:03:44,127
No one died there was that

1288
01:03:44,639 --> 01:03:45,151
The writer of the hunt

1289
01:03:45,407 --> 01:03:46,175
Hunger Games

1290
01:03:46,431 --> 01:03:47,199
Is from

1291
01:03:47,711 --> 01:03:48,479
The city of

1292
01:03:50,271 --> 01:03:52,063
In this episode he starts off with

1293
01:03:52,319 --> 01:03:53,087
With a slightly different

1294
01:03:54,111 --> 01:03:54,879
And that is

1295
01:03:55,903 --> 01:03:56,415
Express

1296
01:03:56,671 --> 01:03:57,183
That

1297
01:03:58,207 --> 01:03:59,231
Let me see if I can

1298
01:03:59,743 --> 01:04:00,511
Cuz it's dumb

1299
01:04:02,047 --> 01:04:03,327
In the Aurora shooting

1300
01:04:04,095 --> 01:04:05,375
There was a gag order

1301
01:04:05,631 --> 01:04:07,167
Alright I am already finding this

1302
01:04:07,423 --> 01:04:11,007
To be stupid

1303
01:04:11,263 --> 01:04:12,799
President Obama talked about the

1304
01:04:13,055 --> 01:04:16,383
The Sandy Hook shooting

1305
01:04:16,639 --> 01:04:22,783
Talkabouttd

1306
01:04:23,039 --> 01:04:24,319
Because there was an act

1307
01:04:24,831 --> 01:04:26,367
Crime

1308
01:04:26,623 --> 01:04:27,135
Was protecting

1309
01:04:27,647 --> 01:04:29,695
Because Obama talked about Sandy Hook

1310
01:04:29,951 --> 01:04:32,511
There wasn't a gag order to actually reinforce

1311
01:04:32,767 --> 01:04:36,351
There's no crime there for no before Obama didn't commit a crime

1312
01:04:40,959 --> 01:04:47,103
Doesn't understand

1313
01:04:47,359 --> 01:04:52,223
What is 1250

1314
01:04:54,015 --> 01:04:59,391
Not going to great

1315
01:04:59,647 --> 01:05:02,975
Turn the phrase midnight

1316
01:05:05,279 --> 01:05:08,863
I thought like this is

1317
01:05:09,375 --> 01:05:09,887
Weird

1318
01:05:10,143 --> 01:05:14,495
Yeah that's

1319
01:05:16,031 --> 01:05:16,799
Line of thought

1320
01:05:18,591 --> 01:05:19,103
It's mind-blowing

1321
01:05:28,063 --> 01:05:34,207
Gag order

1322
01:05:39,839 --> 01:05:45,983
Federal and 10th

1323
01:05:46,239 --> 01:05:52,383
Criminal

1324
01:05:59,295 --> 01:06:00,319
Sure

1325
01:06:00,575 --> 01:06:01,855
That's weird

1326
01:06:02,111 --> 01:06:03,135
But I'm very strange

1327
01:06:04,415 --> 01:06:05,951
I just don't like how you

1328
01:06:07,231 --> 01:06:07,743
So

1329
01:06:08,511 --> 01:06:09,023
Good

1330
01:06:09,535 --> 01:06:10,559
At manipulation

1331
01:06:11,071 --> 01:06:12,351
And then in the neck

1332
01:06:13,375 --> 01:06:13,887
So

1333
01:06:15,423 --> 01:06:16,703
I mean it's on

1334
01:06:16,959 --> 01:06:19,775
Real what he is saying

1335
01:06:20,031 --> 01:06:21,311
Is that true

1336
01:06:21,567 --> 01:06:22,591
It's not it doesn't

1337
01:06:23,359 --> 01:06:23,871
It doesn't

1338
01:06:27,455 --> 01:06:31,295
So nobody's going to end

1339
01:06:32,575 --> 01:06:34,111
Steve's argument

1340
01:06:34,367 --> 01:06:36,927
To be that Laura was real

1341
01:06:37,183 --> 01:06:38,975
That was a crazy dude

1342
01:06:39,231 --> 01:06:43,839
A real crime was committed

1343
01:06:44,863 --> 01:06:45,631
Nautical flag

1344
01:06:46,399 --> 01:06:47,935
City of false flag

1345
01:06:48,191 --> 01:06:49,215
Proven by Obama's

1346
01:06:49,727 --> 01:06:50,239
Something about it

1347
01:06:50,495 --> 01:06:52,799
Breaking a gag order

1348
01:06:54,079 --> 01:06:55,103
It's all

1349
01:06:58,431 --> 01:06:58,943
So

1350
01:06:59,711 --> 01:07:00,735
Alex takes issue with

1351
01:07:00,991 --> 01:07:03,295
Because he does believe it Aurora

1352
01:07:03,551 --> 01:07:09,183
A little bit of a difficulty he's like

1353
01:07:09,439 --> 01:07:11,231
Respond to that by just

1354
01:07:11,487 --> 01:07:12,767
Sort of really getting

1355
01:08:00,639 --> 01:08:04,479
No I'm not

1356
01:08:04,735 --> 01:08:05,503
You're really

1357
01:08:07,039 --> 01:08:07,551
Bananas

1358
01:08:07,807 --> 01:08:08,319
Yeah

1359
01:08:08,575 --> 01:08:10,111
Susan Collins

1360
01:08:10,879 --> 01:08:17,023
Specifically she was writing about false Flags

1361
01:08:17,279 --> 01:08:17,791
The Newtown Connecticut

1362
01:08:18,303 --> 01:08:19,071
No

1363
01:08:19,327 --> 01:08:23,679
His only real connection is that there are schoolchildren in

1364
01:08:24,191 --> 01:08:25,471
And they are fighting

1365
01:08:27,007 --> 01:08:28,031
Timmy is

1366
01:08:28,287 --> 01:08:30,079
As best I can tell

1367
01:08:30,335 --> 01:08:31,103
That exist

1368
01:08:33,663 --> 01:08:34,175
That's fine

1369
01:08:34,431 --> 01:08:40,575
Zero Dark Thirty

1370
01:08:40,831 --> 01:08:44,415
The Grind With creative

1371
01:08:44,671 --> 01:08:47,743
Yeah is involved with Tom Clancy

1372
01:08:48,255 --> 01:08:50,559
Respected enough

1373
01:08:50,815 --> 01:08:53,119
Not a lot of people respect to ghostwriting

1374
01:08:55,679 --> 01:08:56,191
Got a lot of people

1375
01:08:59,007 --> 01:09:00,287
This conversation

1376
01:09:00,543 --> 01:09:02,591
You know Steve is expressing a lot of things that are

1377
01:09:02,847 --> 01:09:04,127
Counter to Alex's

1378
01:09:04,383 --> 01:09:05,151
Stated position

1379
01:09:05,663 --> 01:09:11,807
First of all that you know don't worry about Aurora we'll talk about Sandy Hook

1380
01:09:12,063 --> 01:09:13,599
No big deal nothing happen

1381
01:09:14,111 --> 01:09:14,623
Alex

1382
01:09:14,879 --> 01:09:17,695
Position he will end up

1383
01:09:17,951 --> 01:09:19,231
Which is string

1384
01:09:19,487 --> 01:09:20,511
And also Alex

1385
01:09:20,767 --> 01:09:21,791
Allowing this

1386
01:09:22,047 --> 01:09:24,863
It happened on his show with very little pushback outside

1387
01:09:25,631 --> 01:09:27,423
I think Aurora is fake too

1388
01:09:27,679 --> 01:09:28,447
Eva

1389
01:09:28,703 --> 01:09:29,215
This is his other

1390
01:09:30,751 --> 01:09:33,567
Specific

1391
01:09:41,503 --> 01:09:44,319
What you're saying that tells you

1392
01:09:51,743 --> 01:09:57,119
So like I said earlier the biggest stumbling block that he has is like why

1393
01:10:00,191 --> 01:10:00,703
He's pretty f******

1394
01:10:00,959 --> 01:10:03,519
Smart and manipulative able to come up with a

1395
01:10:03,775 --> 01:10:04,799
Compelling reason for Alex

1396
01:10:05,055 --> 01:10:10,431
To believe it would be easier for them to not kill even though they love to kill and have fun

1397
01:10:10,687 --> 01:10:12,479
Then that would resolve any of the

1398
01:10:12,991 --> 01:10:15,295
Rebuttal

1399
01:10:15,551 --> 01:10:17,855
Yep

1400
01:10:18,111 --> 01:10:20,159
That's not a hard hurdle now

1401
01:10:20,415 --> 01:10:21,439
And especially in his

1402
01:10:21,695 --> 01:10:22,975
State of being right now

1403
01:10:23,231 --> 01:10:24,767
So deferential at

1404
01:10:25,535 --> 01:10:28,095
Like this is Daddy issue on

1405
01:10:28,351 --> 01:10:30,143
Display here is an older man

1406
01:10:30,399 --> 01:10:34,239
And who I respect and he is allowed to hold forth and whenever I push

1407
01:10:35,007 --> 01:10:35,519
Going to be with a

1408
01:10:36,031 --> 01:10:40,127
Every state in fesbian

1409
01:10:40,639 --> 01:10:41,407
Everything is a quest

1410
01:10:41,919 --> 01:10:43,967
Yeah

1411
01:10:44,223 --> 01:10:44,735
At all like

1412
01:10:44,991 --> 01:10:45,503
Eve Alex's

1413
01:10:45,759 --> 01:10:46,527
State is very

1414
01:10:47,295 --> 01:10:50,367
To hold court for long stretches

1415
01:10:55,231 --> 01:10:55,743
It's just

1416
01:10:56,255 --> 01:10:57,279
Public pontificate

1417
01:10:57,535 --> 01:11:01,375
Sing about a whole bunch of

1418
01:11:01,887 --> 01:11:02,655
Really is in

1419
01:11:03,423 --> 01:11:04,191
There's a lot of like

1420
01:11:04,447 --> 01:11:04,959
Packaging

1421
01:11:05,471 --> 01:11:08,543
His argument about Sandy Hook with a lot of window dressing about

1422
01:11:08,799 --> 01:11:09,823
Like

1423
01:11:10,079 --> 01:11:11,359
Return of small business

1424
01:11:11,615 --> 01:11:14,431
The era of false flag already

1425
01:11:14,687 --> 01:11:16,223
Which we know is bad prediction

1426
01:11:16,735 --> 01:11:19,295
Sure

1427
01:11:20,063 --> 01:11:20,831
No Thomas

1428
01:11:23,135 --> 01:11:25,951
Steve does say that Europe has never valued entrepreneurship

1429
01:11:26,207 --> 01:11:27,743
Are these people

1430
01:11:28,767 --> 01:11:33,887
Anyway it's a little bit longer but this is Steve laying out his big

1431
01:11:35,679 --> 01:11:37,471
I guess about Sandy Hook being

1432
01:11:38,495 --> 01:11:40,543
I want to allow him to speak

1433
01:11:41,311 --> 01:11:47,455
I asked why I was talking to doctor Steve in the break and I

1434
01:11:47,711 --> 01:11:50,271
Specifically

1435
01:11:55,135 --> 01:11:58,719
Repeat

1436
01:12:31,487 --> 01:12:34,303
Call Susan Collins

1437
01:12:34,815 --> 01:12:37,887
The first piece of evidence Susan Collins

1438
01:12:38,143 --> 01:12:40,447
Dash he's a writer who's written similar things

1439
01:12:40,703 --> 01:12:41,727
Even lives there yoga

1440
01:12:42,751 --> 01:12:46,079
Hunger Game movies

1441
01:13:06,303 --> 01:13:12,447
Who is 42 social media Emergency Management

1442
01:13:12,703 --> 01:13:15,775
Emergency Management Institute

1443
01:13:17,823 --> 01:13:22,175
Prestige community

1444
01:13:27,039 --> 01:13:33,183
Psychologist

1445
01:13:44,447 --> 01:13:50,591
Minecraft

1446
01:13:51,871 --> 01:13:58,015
Irish cops who I have to go in Connecticut

1447
01:13:59,039 --> 01:14:01,855
Wealthy community alcohol

1448
01:14:02,367 --> 01:14:08,511
No evidence of murder or killing

1449
01:14:13,375 --> 01:14:19,519
In contrast to Aurora

1450
01:14:24,127 --> 01:14:28,991
By the way not a psychiatric disorder

1451
01:14:35,903 --> 01:14:42,047
Irrelevant

1452
01:14:48,703 --> 01:14:49,983
Alarm for today

1453
01:14:55,103 --> 01:14:56,127
So you see that

1454
01:14:56,383 --> 01:14:57,151
Alex

1455
01:14:57,663 --> 01:14:58,175
Response

1456
01:14:59,455 --> 01:15:00,735
The Cavalcade of b*******

1457
01:15:00,991 --> 01:15:03,039
Is to be like

1458
01:15:03,551 --> 01:15:06,623
Obama is trying to

1459
01:15:06,879 --> 01:15:08,415
To push the Small Arms Treaty

1460
01:15:09,183 --> 01:15:10,975
That's him talking himself into the

1461
01:15:11,231 --> 01:15:17,375
Yep he's in a vulnerable position cuz globalist in a hot tub it really threw him off

1462
01:15:19,167 --> 01:15:21,471
Yeah I don't know is that Alex

1463
01:15:21,983 --> 01:15:23,263
In control of all of its back

1464
01:15:23,519 --> 01:15:25,055
Kobe's wouldn't behave exactly the same way

1465
01:15:25,311 --> 01:15:28,127
He probably would but it's it's a bad

1466
01:15:28,383 --> 01:15:28,895
State for him to

1467
01:15:29,407 --> 01:15:31,199
You can see it you can see that you starting to be

1468
01:15:31,967 --> 01:15:34,015
I probably wouldn't happen so obvious

1469
01:15:36,575 --> 01:15:37,087
Do you think

1470
01:15:37,343 --> 01:15:38,111
The crisis actors

1471
01:15:38,367 --> 01:15:38,879
Is Guild

1472
01:15:39,903 --> 01:15:40,415
View Inn

1473
01:15:40,927 --> 01:15:42,463
They have an amazing package

1474
01:15:42,719 --> 01:15:43,743
When do I get my

1475
01:15:48,863 --> 01:15:50,655
Tagine rosin is the guy who the kids

1476
01:15:50,911 --> 01:15:51,679
Blade

1477
01:15:51,935 --> 01:15:53,471
To his front yard

1478
01:15:53,727 --> 01:15:54,239
Overact

1479
01:15:56,031 --> 01:15:56,799
Not any of it

1480
01:15:57,823 --> 01:15:58,591
The other piece

1481
01:15:58,847 --> 01:15:59,871
There were

1482
01:16:00,127 --> 01:16:00,639
You know like

1483
01:16:01,151 --> 01:16:03,199
Guidelines about how to cover

1484
01:16:03,455 --> 01:16:03,967
Disaster

1485
01:16:07,807 --> 01:16:08,319
This is how we

1486
01:16:08,575 --> 01:16:09,599
Planned disaster

1487
01:16:09,855 --> 01:16:10,623
Complete misrepresent

1488
01:16:11,391 --> 01:16:12,159
Always

1489
01:16:12,415 --> 01:16:15,231
Starting about like these are Irish

1490
01:16:15,743 --> 01:16:21,887
Rich area

1491
01:16:23,423 --> 01:16:25,727
Aurelia

1492
01:16:25,983 --> 01:16:32,127
Can I get pension increase

1493
01:16:34,687 --> 01:16:35,711
He doesn't say it in this clip

1494
01:16:35,967 --> 01:16:36,479
But it's

1495
01:16:36,735 --> 01:16:38,271
It relates back to other things

1496
01:16:38,527 --> 01:16:39,807
Please set it in the last step

1497
01:16:40,063 --> 01:16:40,831
Episode we covered

1498
01:16:41,087 --> 01:16:44,927
Irish cops I've ever heard of

1499
01:16:45,183 --> 01:16:45,951
PTSD from you

1500
01:16:48,255 --> 01:16:48,767
Providence

1501
01:16:51,583 --> 01:16:53,887
That we bottle it up down inside until we

1502
01:16:55,423 --> 01:16:55,935
It's just phlegm

1503
01:16:56,959 --> 01:17:00,799
I love coming in with like a lot of things to say

1504
01:17:01,055 --> 01:17:02,847
But all of it is so weak

1505
01:17:03,359 --> 01:17:04,127
I love that

1506
01:17:04,383 --> 01:17:10,527
He even goes over like his all that we know is that his mom gave him guns and alcohol and there's nothing wrong with that

1507
01:17:13,343 --> 01:17:14,879
No no most

1508
01:17:15,135 --> 01:17:16,671
If not all violence

1509
01:17:17,183 --> 01:17:19,231
Happens when alcohol is involved

1510
01:17:19,999 --> 01:17:20,767
Yep

1511
01:17:21,279 --> 01:17:25,119
But Alex is starting to come around but I don't

1512
01:17:25,631 --> 01:17:26,399
His body and yet

1513
01:17:26,911 --> 01:17:27,679
I think you can see that

1514
01:17:41,503 --> 01:17:42,527
Aurora Frank

1515
01:17:55,071 --> 01:17:55,583
And

1516
01:18:04,031 --> 01:18:06,847
Episode

1517
01:18:08,639 --> 01:18:09,151
He's not

1518
01:18:09,407 --> 01:18:10,687
He's not operating well

1519
01:18:13,503 --> 01:18:14,527
To be resolved for Alex

1520
01:18:14,783 --> 01:18:15,807
To take up the

1521
01:18:16,319 --> 01:18:16,831
Theory

1522
01:18:17,087 --> 01:18:17,599
Kids

1523
01:18:17,855 --> 01:18:18,623
Didn't get killed

1524
01:18:18,879 --> 01:18:19,391
AR

1525
01:18:19,647 --> 01:18:25,791
Someone explaining to him better

1526
01:18:26,047 --> 01:18:28,095
They're not actually killing people

1527
01:18:28,351 --> 01:18:29,887
That's super easy

1528
01:18:30,143 --> 01:18:30,911
Perceived

1529
01:18:31,167 --> 01:18:34,495
Easy for him to resolve this other lingering

1530
01:18:34,751 --> 01:18:35,775
Concern

1531
01:18:36,031 --> 01:18:36,799
About Aurora

1532
01:18:37,311 --> 01:18:38,591
Play Speakers by alright yes I was

1533
01:18:47,551 --> 01:18:50,623
Argument

1534
01:18:50,879 --> 01:18:51,647
You convinced me

1535
01:18:51,903 --> 01:18:53,183
Galaxy

1536
01:18:53,439 --> 01:18:55,743
That would be perfect

1537
01:18:58,815 --> 01:19:00,095
At least what I see

1538
01:19:00,351 --> 01:19:02,911
From all of my experience of Alex's psychology

1539
01:19:03,167 --> 01:19:05,983
How he comports himself howdy howdy cover stuff

1540
01:19:06,495 --> 01:19:07,263
He's on

1541
01:19:07,519 --> 01:19:08,031
The edge

1542
01:19:09,567 --> 01:19:10,591
Teetering on the edge

1543
01:19:11,103 --> 01:19:11,871
All it takes

1544
01:19:12,383 --> 01:19:12,895
Is resolving a

1545
01:19:13,151 --> 01:19:14,687
A couple tiny little thoughts

1546
01:19:14,943 --> 01:19:15,455
But he has

1547
01:19:15,711 --> 01:19:16,479
In order for him to

1548
01:19:16,735 --> 01:19:17,247
To get on board

1549
01:19:19,039 --> 01:19:19,807
So Prime

1550
01:19:20,575 --> 01:19:23,647
Now that you have a f****** psych Warfare guy involved

1551
01:19:23,903 --> 01:19:27,231
You're just asking for it

1552
01:19:27,487 --> 01:19:28,511
If you don't that

1553
01:19:28,767 --> 01:19:31,583
Never talked to someone like Steve ever

1554
01:19:31,839 --> 01:19:34,143
You know it's it's almost one of those things where I want

1555
01:19:37,215 --> 01:19:37,727
A benchmark

1556
01:19:38,495 --> 01:19:40,799
How good are you

1557
01:19:41,311 --> 01:19:42,847
And also how good am I

1558
01:19:43,103 --> 01:19:47,199
See this is how you get this is how you end up on the rocks

1559
01:19:47,455 --> 01:19:53,599
Sirens do you want to hear the song boats going to crash baby

1560
01:19:55,647 --> 01:19:57,695
I just want to hear the song

1561
01:19:58,719 --> 01:20:00,511
I think I think your

1562
01:20:00,767 --> 01:20:01,279
Seeing Alex

1563
01:20:02,047 --> 01:20:03,071
Being seduced

1564
01:20:03,327 --> 01:20:04,351
In this direction

1565
01:20:04,607 --> 01:20:05,631
But refusing to be

1566
01:20:05,887 --> 01:20:06,655
Be pushed over the edge

1567
01:20:06,911 --> 01:20:08,703
Until a few lingering question

1568
01:20:09,215 --> 01:20:09,983
Resolve

1569
01:20:11,263 --> 01:20:11,775
Going to be hard

1570
01:20:12,543 --> 01:20:13,055
Steve

1571
01:20:13,311 --> 01:20:14,080
Is very capable

1572
01:20:14,592 --> 01:20:15,104
Of doing that

1573
01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:16,128
I think that's where we're going to

1574
01:20:16,896 --> 01:20:17,920
In the very near

1575
01:20:18,176 --> 01:20:19,456
I think just about anybody

1576
01:20:19,968 --> 01:20:20,736
Pretty capable of

1577
01:20:20,992 --> 01:20:22,272
Kicking him over the edge

1578
01:20:23,040 --> 01:20:26,624
Right but you got Prime but it's gotta be somebody likes

1579
01:20:27,136 --> 01:20:29,952
Older man who reminds

1580
01:20:30,208 --> 01:20:30,976
For sure.

1581
01:20:32,512 --> 01:20:34,304
Jim Fetzer who wrote no one died

1582
01:20:34,560 --> 01:20:36,096
Would be able to do it

1583
01:20:36,352 --> 01:20:37,888
Cuz he doesn't know how to work with Alex

1584
01:20:38,144 --> 01:20:38,912
Psychology

1585
01:20:39,168 --> 01:20:39,680
Steve.

1586
01:20:39,936 --> 01:20:42,240
Steve knows what you need to do is

1587
01:20:42,496 --> 01:20:44,032
You have put sugar around the pill

1588
01:20:44,288 --> 01:20:44,800
Rite Aid

1589
01:20:45,056 --> 01:20:46,080
To Sweet Malik's up

1590
01:20:46,336 --> 01:20:46,848
Complement

1591
01:20:47,104 --> 01:20:47,616
Flattering

1592
01:20:48,128 --> 01:20:52,480
Evoking your history together of like

1593
01:20:55,808 --> 01:20:59,648
You need to you need to frame any possible disagreement as just like

1594
01:20:59,904 --> 01:21:01,184
Well we're both really smart

1595
01:21:01,440 --> 01:21:02,976
That's why we disagree on things

1596
01:21:03,232 --> 01:21:09,376
Exactly overwhelmed with flattery and a lot of

1597
01:21:09,632 --> 01:21:10,912
Be able to convince

1598
01:21:11,168 --> 01:21:16,800
Position of like I'm correct

1599
01:21:17,056 --> 01:21:21,920
Let's bring it together

1600
01:21:22,432 --> 01:21:23,200
I just need to

1601
01:21:23,456 --> 01:21:25,760
Bring it out when you're

1602
01:21:28,832 --> 01:21:30,368
Already there I'm just

1603
01:21:30,624 --> 01:21:31,136
Breaking away

1604
01:21:32,160 --> 01:21:33,184
The Marvels

1605
01:21:33,696 --> 01:21:34,208
Yep

1606
01:21:38,048 --> 01:21:38,560
Was

1607
01:21:38,816 --> 01:21:40,096
Any policy will

1608
01:21:40,352 --> 01:21:44,704
They could take the lessons learned from the show

1609
01:21:44,960 --> 01:21:45,984
And convince Alex if

1610
01:21:46,240 --> 01:21:48,544
I definitely think that's true

1611
01:21:51,872 --> 01:21:52,896
Tear and it's

1612
01:21:53,152 --> 01:21:54,432
Just some indication

1613
01:21:54,944 --> 01:21:55,456
Steve is not

1614
01:21:58,272 --> 01:21:59,040
I think that

1615
01:21:59,296 --> 01:22:00,576
You see that

1616
01:22:00,832 --> 01:22:01,344
Obviously

1617
01:22:01,600 --> 01:22:05,184
Steve pieczenik is somebody who's up to no good and is meddling in Alex's life

1618
01:22:05,696 --> 01:22:07,488
For whatever reason.

1619
01:22:07,744 --> 01:22:10,048
Outside

1620
01:22:10,304 --> 01:22:11,072
Just convincing him

1621
01:22:15,424 --> 01:22:19,264
Whatever the f*** people on the

1622
01:22:20,800 --> 01:22:23,104
Sure

1623
01:22:26,432 --> 01:22:28,480
I think he likes

1624
01:22:34,880 --> 01:22:41,024
Don't even think of that in terms of a civil war

1625
01:22:41,280 --> 01:22:45,376
Abraham Lincoln

1626
01:22:50,752 --> 01:22:51,520
Stop president

1627
01:22:58,432 --> 01:22:59,456
Oh boy

1628
01:23:04,832 --> 01:23:06,368
You want some slaves

1629
01:23:08,672 --> 01:23:13,280
I don't know what greater psychic Warfare is there

1630
01:23:14,816 --> 01:23:15,328
Something to that

1631
01:23:15,584 --> 01:23:19,168
I don't know what that is but I do know that he seems to be

1632
01:23:19,680 --> 01:23:25,824
Northern northern

1633
01:23:26,080 --> 01:23:32,224
You do see a lot of Confederate sympathies

1634
01:23:36,064 --> 01:23:37,088
Yeah what is where is he

1635
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:39,392
I mean I know you lives in Florida

1636
01:23:39,648 --> 01:23:42,464
But where is he

1637
01:23:42,720 --> 01:23:48,352
Cuba Northern

1638
01:23:48,608 --> 01:23:50,144
So I don't know

1639
01:23:50,400 --> 01:23:50,912
Betty White

1640
01:23:52,192 --> 01:23:55,776
Very weird

1641
01:23:56,544 --> 01:23:57,568
Feel like this is a bit

1642
01:24:08,064 --> 01:24:11,904
Pretty much

1643
01:24:12,160 --> 01:24:18,304
About race

1644
01:24:18,560 --> 01:24:20,864
No no

1645
01:24:21,120 --> 01:24:23,424
Know how that works

1646
01:24:23,936 --> 01:24:28,032
He really wants to say the word uppity on a daily basis

1647
01:24:28,288 --> 01:24:29,568
If you really want

1648
01:24:29,824 --> 01:24:32,896
To say it yeah I feel like that's just an indication of

1649
01:24:33,152 --> 01:24:33,664
That's some pretty late

1650
01:24:35,200 --> 01:24:37,248
Northern invasion

1651
01:24:37,504 --> 01:24:38,016
It was pretty

1652
01:24:38,272 --> 01:24:44,160
Pretty clear where your sympathies lie if you saved

1653
01:24:44,416 --> 01:24:45,184
John Wilkes Booth

1654
01:24:45,440 --> 01:24:51,584
Revealed

1655
01:24:52,352 --> 01:24:55,424
I think you can hide behind a lot of ideas about

1656
01:24:57,728 --> 01:25:01,312
Stuff like that with the northern invasion

1657
01:25:01,824 --> 01:25:03,104
But

1658
01:25:03,360 --> 01:25:04,640
Expressing something like this

1659
01:25:10,016 --> 01:25:10,784
American wars

1660
01:25:11,040 --> 01:25:11,552
The northern

1661
01:25:12,576 --> 01:25:13,856
You wouldn't have a goddamn

1662
01:25:14,112 --> 01:25:16,160
State Alex if it weren't for the northern

1663
01:25:17,184 --> 01:25:18,464
That's an interesting Theory

1664
01:25:23,584 --> 01:25:25,632
More convinced than ever that Alex

1665
01:25:25,888 --> 01:25:28,192
Being softly LED down the path

1666
01:25:28,448 --> 01:25:29,472
To Sandy Hook denial is

1667
01:25:29,728 --> 01:25:32,800
By doctor Steve

1668
01:25:33,824 --> 01:25:36,128
Based on

1669
01:25:36,384 --> 01:25:36,896
Is

1670
01:25:37,152 --> 01:25:38,432
That it might be a good

1671
01:25:38,688 --> 01:25:39,200
Cigar time

1672
01:25:39,456 --> 01:25:42,272
For our next episode to forgo going back to the

1673
01:25:42,528 --> 01:25:48,672
The present-day checking in on whatever.

1674
01:25:51,744 --> 01:25:52,256
Has been involved

1675
01:25:53,024 --> 01:25:54,048
Take a closer look

1676
01:25:54,304 --> 01:25:56,096
Who is this guy

1677
01:25:56,352 --> 01:25:57,376
Is he crazy

1678
01:25:57,888 --> 01:25:59,168
What what's going on

1679
01:25:59,680 --> 01:26:00,192
Which

1680
01:26:01,216 --> 01:26:03,520
Novels did he write with Tom Clancy

1681
01:26:04,288 --> 01:26:07,104
Interested know which one to use his belt

1682
01:26:07,360 --> 01:26:11,968
So I hope you have residual

1683
01:26:12,224 --> 01:26:16,832
I guess in effect because on Mondays episode we stumbled into

1684
01:26:17,088 --> 01:26:17,600
To Steve pieczenik

1685
01:26:17,856 --> 01:26:18,624
Showing up in the past

1686
01:26:19,648 --> 01:26:22,976
In-N-Out this episode we see he comes back a couple days later

1687
01:26:23,232 --> 01:26:25,024
And he's very clearly

1688
01:26:25,280 --> 01:26:26,048
Putting forth

1689
01:26:26,304 --> 01:26:27,584
Hey aggressive

1690
01:26:28,096 --> 01:26:30,144
Sandy Hook no one died there arguing

1691
01:26:31,424 --> 01:26:32,704
Good to know more

1692
01:26:32,960 --> 01:26:33,472
About him

1693
01:26:34,496 --> 01:26:36,032
So on Friday

1694
01:26:36,288 --> 01:26:37,056
With a

1695
01:26:37,312 --> 01:26:38,336
Steve pieczenik breakdown

1696

Steve pieczenik

1697
01:26:53,440 --> 01:26:53,952
