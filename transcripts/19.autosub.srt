You heard up top

00:00:15,104 --> 00:00:15,616
The sound

5
00:00:15,872 --> 00:00:19,200
Cork popping

6
00:00:19,456 --> 00:00:24,576
Absolutely ears to the globalist

7
00:00:27,392 --> 00:00:29,184
It's a mild celebration

8
00:00:30,464 --> 00:00:34,560
The thing the trends that we're seeing are going exactly the direction we expect

9
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:39,424
I speculated that

10
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:40,704
Friday would be a

11
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,496

12
00:00:42,752 --> 00:00:46,592

You don't know anything about Dolores

17
00:00:56,832 --> 00:00:57,344

00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,416
I know a lot about Infowars you too much info

19
00:01:01,184 --> 00:01:01,952
One day we're going to figure out

20
00:01:02,208 --> 00:01:02,720
How to do this smooth

21
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:06,304
Anyway the show is me explaining what's happened

22
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,328

We're just really excited

25
00:01:13,216 --> 00:01:13,984
Very prompt

26
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,008

Write a March

29
00:01:18,848 --> 00:01:20,384
In the Life of Alex Jones

30
00:01:22,688 --> 00:01:24,736
In the greater World outside of him

31
00:01:24,992 --> 00:01:26,784
Is that everything

32
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:28,832
Coming out

33
00:01:29,088 --> 00:01:30,368
To be not accurate

34
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:31,648
And all of these

35
00:01:31,904 --> 00:01:32,416
Allies

36
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:33,696
Is that he had built up around

37
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:35,488
Themself

38
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:40,096
Address

39
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:40,864
These things

40
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:41,632
Head on

41
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:43,424
He can't talk about the session

42
00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:45,216
Except

43
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:45,984
To say

44
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,264
You was doing his job

45
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,288
Like that

46
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:49,312
Address

47
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:50,080
The fact that

48
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:52,128
Met with

49
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,920
Russian ambassador

50
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,248
Be in Cleveland

51
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:01,600
And he traveled there

52
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:07,232
Fun

53
00:02:07,488 --> 00:02:10,304
What's a great idea

54
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,120
He's legally there in the capacity as a trump surrogate

55
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:16,448
Service

56
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,520
Because there's no wiggle room

57
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:22,080
Kushner's

58
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:22,848
Situation with

59
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:25,664
Why the f*** was your son-in-law in a meeting with Flynn

60
00:02:26,176 --> 00:02:29,504
And the Russians

61
00:02:32,064 --> 00:02:35,392
Listen to me because the whole like why the f*** is your son-in-law anywhere near this

62
00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:37,440
Totally

63
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:40,000
Kennesaw the israel-palestine conflict

64
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,864
Can address the Kushner situation he can't dress Carter page

65
00:02:45,376 --> 00:02:50,752
He can to try to pages

66
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:51,520
He may ask

67
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:52,800
Actually be a deer in

68
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:54,080
Like I literally

69
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:59,456
He was on one of those new shows on MSNBC anyway

70
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:01,760
I will not deny that I met the Ambassador

71
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:03,808
Meanwhile

72
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:05,088
You smiling

73
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:05,856
Laika

74
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:07,392
The canary

75
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:08,416
He's a man with

76
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:09,184
The secret

77
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,256
But it's not a secret that most people know what it is

78
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:14,816
He's being set up to be the Fall Guy

79
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:17,376
I don't know about that

80
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:19,424
Situation

81
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,472
I think that he might be able to

82
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:22,240
To pull it off

83
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:23,520
And get away with a lot of money

84
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:24,288
And run away song

85
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:27,360
Somewhere I think

86
00:03:28,384 --> 00:03:32,480
So we're saying the Carter page is our Kaiser Sosa that's what's that

87
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:35,552
He looks kind of like Kevin Spacey

88
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:38,880
Alex Jones also cannot address the issues with manafort

89
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:39,904
Ukraine

90
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:41,440
Address

91
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:42,720
Suspicious timing

92
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:44,512
About the GOP sauce

93
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:46,048
Its position on Ukraine

94
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:46,816
It wasn't

95
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:48,864
Suspicious he literally said

96
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:50,656
They said that the Trump

97
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:53,216
Trump himself said we need to soft in the

98
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:54,240
Soft

99
00:03:55,264 --> 00:04:00,128
Ukraine meetings with Russian

100
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:03,200
Sew-ins

101
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:04,224
Chico's

102
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,504
Buckwild

103
00:04:06,016 --> 00:04:08,576
Turbo lie mode

104
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:11,392
Everywhere

105
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:12,928
And to that extent

106
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:15,488
This episode

107
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:17,024
Getting an order for the clips

108
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:20,863
To go in

109
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:23,423
It's going to be a little

110
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:24,703
Scattershot in Kalamazoo

111
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:28,287
Should be representative of what it is that you listen to

112
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:29,823
I think that's exactly how the

113
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:32,639
A-listers to get a taste of what it's like

114
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:35,711
Alex Jones

115
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:40,575
I unfortunately don't have these in chronological order

116
00:04:41,855 --> 00:04:43,391
Starting to learn

117
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:44,159
Is the

118
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:45,951
The first hour of Alex

119
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:47,231
Is usually born

120
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:49,023
OK Google

121
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:50,815
Good sour

122
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:57,983
First hour super boring

123
00:04:58,239 --> 00:05:00,031
Will it start when you got to warm up

124
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:02,591
Yeah it's been warming up let's warm ourselves up

125
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:03,615
With a little out of

126
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:10,015
Bubbles are open women

127
00:05:12,831 --> 00:05:14,111
Documents about it

128
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:15,647
They're super run tool

129
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:17,951
I just love that

130
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:21,535
So uncool

131
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:23,327
You're just going to find one

132
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:24,863
Drop every episode

133
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:29,215
I have a second one

134
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:36,383
F*** those stupid liberal

135
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:40,735
Liberals

136
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:42,783
I like sounds like a five-year-old

137
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:43,807
Does he does

138
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:46,623
Big lies

139
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:47,903
But he throws out

140
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:49,183
Is breaking news

141
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:50,975
About Obama

142
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:52,767
Have you grab you use the

143
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:54,047
Department of Justice

144
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:57,119
Steal billions of dollars to give to act

145
00:05:57,631 --> 00:05:58,143
Groups

146
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:00,447
Breaking news

147
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:05,567
Glue

148
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:07,103
Here's a who who's that

149
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:08,383
Here's his narrative

150
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:09,919
Okay

151
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:12,223
It's worse than we thought

152
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:16,831
In Florida

153
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:19,391
Which department high-level operative

154
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:20,671
Any mail

155
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:21,951
On the ground

156
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:25,279
Cause riots

157
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:30,143
The division

158
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:35,519
Fox News is reporting and they've got the documents

159
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:39,615
Michelle Whaley

160
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:43,455
I mean that's a very solid

161
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:45,503
I tried to hunt down

162
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:49,087
Give deep as I could following the link

163
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:51,391
Fix the paper

164
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:53,695
But it never really ended up getting anywhere so

165
00:06:53,951 --> 00:06:55,743
But I'll get i'll get here

166
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:57,791
Let's finish this and then I'll get to

167
00:06:58,047 --> 00:06:58,559
Water

168
00:06:58,815 --> 00:06:59,583
You're so giddy

169
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:07,007
Obama transferred billions of dollars

170
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:08,543
To Eric Holder

171
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:14,687
And the Department of Justice we're getting the video report right now

172
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:18,015
Cam right now

173
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:23,391
Obama doj funded billions to liberal activist group

174
00:07:28,767 --> 00:07:31,071
Billions of dollars that is so illegal

175
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:33,887
Department give money

176
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:35,935
The group secretly.

177
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:37,215
Political groups

178
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:39,263
Got the government funding and sound

179
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:46,431
Kill cops

180
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:49,247
This is the government

181
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:54,111
Local and state governments

182
00:07:55,391 --> 00:07:59,743
Is any the truth everything I covered yesterday

183
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:02,815
Turn of Obama

184
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:09,471
Like not even a little not even a little colonel there he's got more fear-mongering

185
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:12,543
But Obama's coming

186
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:16,127
Just to break this down what do you talking about

187
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:18,687
He's acting like this is breaking news and it's not

188
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:19,711
It can't pause

189
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:22,783
Just lose billions

190
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:25,343
The dollars until a year after your present

191
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:28,159
There's an article that I found on Breitbart

192
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:29,695
About this from 2015

193
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:30,719
Solid news source

194
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:33,279
Years old

195
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:38,655
He's coming out with this now and making it sound like the biggest deal in the world breaking news

196
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:41,471
F***** Well it's worse than we thought

197
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:45,823
It's exactly what we thought it's exactly the same

198
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:50,431
Dope is exactly what we thought even references

199
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:52,735
B Bank of America and what's the other one

200
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:53,503
Citibank

201
00:08:57,087 --> 00:08:57,599
Even reference

202
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:00,159
The situation Envy article

203
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:06,303
It's a little bit weird but it's definitely not illegal

204
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:10,143
One of the things is when the government sues an organization

205
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:13,471
Appeasement

206
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:15,775
When they get payouts it doesn't go to the

207
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:17,567
Usually the payout

208
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:21,919
And donated

209
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:23,455
To charitable causes

210
00:09:23,711 --> 00:09:24,479
Or things like that

211
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:29,599
Universal across-the-board it's not how all of the payout

212
00:09:29,855 --> 00:09:32,671
When you lose against the government

213
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:34,463
But in instances

214
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:37,279
This money is going to

215
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:38,815
Radical liberal

216
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:41,119
Service Groups

217
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:43,423
Which which ones are they

218
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:48,287
Blacklivesmatter

219
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:51,103
Maybe some of the harshest

220
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:52,383
Fringe parts of it

221
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:54,175
But that's not what the group is about

222
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:56,223
You know to say that is

223
00:09:56,735 --> 00:09:57,503
Is wildly responsive

224
00:09:58,783 --> 00:10:02,879
Very racist

225
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:07,231
The types of groups that are getting money are like the HUD housing

226
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:10,815
Which is great especially when

227
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:12,607
Housing is part of the issue that the

228
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:13,375
These Banks

229
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:17,215
People for clothes

230
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:24,127
Yeah

231
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:28,479
30 million dollars that year of that money that was

232
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:29,247
From Citibank

233
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:30,271
America

234
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:31,551
Go to the HUD

235
00:10:32,063 --> 00:10:38,207
The Housing and Urban Development Housing Council directly to the people that they

236
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:39,231
Yeah but it's

237
00:10:39,487 --> 00:10:42,559
I understand now I know

238
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:45,119
Directly

239
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:47,935
To the people cuz the people have no standing in court

240
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:49,471
They aren't the one

241
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:50,495
You are suing

242
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:51,519
These organizations

243
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:52,543
Yeah

244
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:55,871
That's why I said it's a little bit murky

245
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:59,455
There should be a XXX victim status

246
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:01,247
Court

247
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:02,783
In this case

248
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:05,599
Go to groups like the house

249
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:07,135
Council or the other one

250
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:09,695
I was the Legal Services Corporation

251
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:10,719
Which helps

252
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:11,487
Provide

253
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:12,511
Legal Services

254
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:13,279
Does the under-privileged

255
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:20,191
I would also prefer a more ironic as opposed to just a monetary settlement out of log homes

256
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:22,239
Yeah

257
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:24,031
Bank of America

258
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:25,823
They get your husband

259
00:11:26,335 --> 00:11:28,127
Like that

260
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:29,663
They live there now

261
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:31,967
60 poor people get to live in your mansion

262
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:37,087
Exactly

263
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:47,583
The story is it broke

264
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:49,119
Conservative

265
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:50,399
Paranoia blog

266
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:53,215
A year-and-a-half

267
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:56,543
Old is not news

268
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:58,591
It's not real and it's not true

269
00:11:59,103 --> 00:11:59,615
Great

270
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:06,015
Distraction cuz nobody's paid attention to that nobody paid attention because it was announced

271
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:07,039
Story then

272
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:08,319
So you bring it up now and

273
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:14,207
It's like we've got this bombshell but nobody cared about nobody cares about and nobody will ever

274
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:19,839
Website for

275
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:23,423
To do is for every episode

276
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:24,447
Provide links

277
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:25,471
Do all of the

278
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:26,239
Documentation

279
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:31,871
Of the things that debunk what he saying people could hear us if you like why should I believe you

280
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:33,151
Write totally fair

281
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:37,247
What about his marriage breaking up most

282
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:45,951
That works

283
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:46,719
Mentor

284
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:50,047
A text

285
00:12:50,303 --> 00:12:51,071
Facts about Obama here

286
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:55,679
Not not super

287
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:56,703
Something to get my pass

288
00:12:57,727 --> 00:12:58,495
He's coming

289
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:00,799
And he's ready to roll

290
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:06,687
This is the New York Times you name it like he's God

291
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:13,599
From president impeachment resignation

292
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:19,999
Quotes New York time with them admitting

293
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:22,047
They leaked the intelligence documents

294
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:23,583
If you sat

295
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:29,983
Perfect did you see what he did there I hope you're pointing out what I was going to run out

296
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:34,591
They are reporting

297
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:39,199
He's ready to roll

298
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:47,647
It seemed like they were Altos

299
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:53,535
Out-of-context quotes from Politico in New York Times articles and then

300
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:57,119
Twisted to be like Obama's got a bunker and he's going to be the

301
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:59,167
The shadow dark government

302
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:01,215
They really don't want to

303
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:07,359
I use that terminology

304
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:09,919
Exactly what they do

305
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:11,711
Just

306
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:22,719
I believe

307
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:24,767
Is the better that better turn there

308
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:26,815
Is that if you were writing that down

309
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:28,351
You have to put quotes

310
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:29,631
Around what the New York

311
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:31,935
Attributed to the New York Times

312
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:33,983
Then quotes around what Paltrow

313
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:36,543
Attributed to Paul Joseph

314
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:41,151
You you can't

315
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:42,687
See him hold up his fingers

316
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:49,599
Free for life

317
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:55,231
He's playing Mad Libs with the truth

318
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:57,023
Excited to see what's going

319
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:57,791
To happen

320
00:14:58,047 --> 00:15:00,095
In terms of this all falling apart

321
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:04,191
Because I really don't know what Alex Jones does when his team loses

322
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:05,727
I don't know if he's going

323
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:07,519
Call for a revolution like

324
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:08,543
People on the street

325
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:11,359
That is a possible outcome

326
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:13,663
There's other than he would

327
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:17,503
Open

328
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:21,599
I think it might be illegal

329
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:28,255
Syndicated radio show

330
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:32,095
Legal situations about to come up to them

331
00:15:33,119 --> 00:15:33,887
I don't know if there's

332
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:34,655
Enough time for

333
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:35,935
Time to get off the trumpet

334
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:39,775
Like it no time is he does he have to have some

335
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:40,543
Catalyst

336
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:42,847
Trump does

337
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:45,919
I thought you was for Liberty

338
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:48,223
Prosperity

339
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:50,783
But I don't know what that would be

340
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:53,087
Makes up

341
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:54,367
That's true

342
00:15:54,623 --> 00:15:59,743
Where's my where's my war games on what Alex Jones

343
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:08,447
Alex Jones

344
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:10,239
See the writing on the wall

345
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:11,263
Cease what happened

346
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:12,543
His

347
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:14,079
Narrative then is

348
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:16,127
Another phone call

349
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:21,503
Time I realized

350
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:23,295
Find me the whole time

351
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:24,063
Rusted out

352
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:28,671
You know what you can really ride Alex Jones for so long before Alex

353
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:29,439
Jones

354
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:30,975
Is it out I disagree that's

355
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:36,351
But would I think it would be is I have had phone calls with unnamed high up

356
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:37,375
Sources

357
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:38,399
The government

358
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:41,471
Okay

359
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:45,311
General

360
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:50,687
Flame

361
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:57,087
I think he brings this up in a clip we're going to play

362
00:16:57,343 --> 00:16:58,879
Later he believes

363
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:00,927
But everyone was painting

364
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:05,791
Flynn unfairly is a Russian spy

365
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:07,071
This I'm out of here

366
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:10,911
And he was just so offended that people thought he was a spy that's right

367
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:13,215
America it's not even worth

368
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:18,847
The coverage right right right

369
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:22,431
She's like the Russian Ambassador they're giving him a lot of like

370
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:27,551
Recruiter with zero

371
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:32,159
Turning

372
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:34,463
Trump is a Russian agent

373
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:37,791
The issue is that

374
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:39,071
They had these conversations

375
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:41,375
A long time ago

376
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:42,399
Policy changes

377
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:44,191
When they were not in office

378
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:48,287
And if they were in office

379
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:50,591
It would have been fine

380
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:02,623
Inflate the idea of like

381
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:04,159
Chuck Schumer met with them

382
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:07,743
It's completely not the

383
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:09,279
Conversation

384
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:12,607
A lot

385
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:14,399
Think that Jeff

386
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:16,703
The Russian part of it is the

387
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:20,543
Piedmont with of the French

388
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:21,567
Ambassador

389
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:33,087
We're getting into

390
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:39,487
About Obama

391
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:41,535
I kind of want to see what Obama does

392
00:18:42,047 --> 00:18:48,191
I want to see Obama's this morning on Saturday morning

393
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:50,751
We did a bunch of stuff about Obama tapping his phone

394
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:52,799
That he got the information

395
00:18:53,055 --> 00:18:53,567
From a

396
00:18:55,103 --> 00:18:55,615
Yep

397
00:19:00,735 --> 00:19:02,015
Through a spokesman responded

398
00:19:12,511 --> 00:19:15,071
Everybody

399
00:19:15,327 --> 00:19:16,607
Who knows anything knows

400
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:21,471
Then I mean that there was probable cause

401
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:22,239
Sabbag

402
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:24,031
The Trump Tower

403
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:26,847
Is that

404
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:29,151
Under under the law

405
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:30,687
That we know of

406
00:19:32,223 --> 00:19:33,247
Whether or not

407
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:36,831
Because the Feist Accord is basically a rubber stamp

408
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:38,367
Well.

409
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:43,231
You're probably right

410
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:44,255
Green light for the one

411
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:50,399
I think it might have some

412
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:53,215
If there was a bug

413
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:53,983
She is f***

414
00:19:54,239 --> 00:19:54,751
Tax return

415
00:19:55,263 --> 00:19:57,055
If it was a bug there was probable cause

416
00:19:58,335 --> 00:19:58,847
Signed off on it

417
00:19:59,103 --> 00:20:00,639
Is there

418
00:20:01,151 --> 00:20:02,175
You the f****** lunatic

419
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:06,271
Who believes everything he reads on Breitbart another problem

420
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:07,039
The other problem

421
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:07,807
There though

422
00:20:08,063 --> 00:20:08,575
Is that

423
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:10,111
Either way

424
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:11,903
If it's real or not

425
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:15,231
He's a f******

426
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:17,791
But

427
00:20:18,047 --> 00:20:19,071
We are talking too much

428
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:22,143
Not getting to the clips so let's get back

429
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:23,935
This is the first instance on this

430
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:25,215
Michelle

431
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:29,567
Alex Jones

432
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:34,175
Co-hosts with him throughout most of the show cuz

433
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:34,943
You need the babies

434
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:40,831
Okay

435
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:42,367
And it's interesting because I also

436
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:44,159
Start to feel a little pity

437
00:20:47,487 --> 00:20:47,999
It's similar to

438
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:51,583
Key for the devil

439
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:54,399
He also has he has to stand next to next to him

440
00:20:57,471 --> 00:21:00,543
Who's the guy who we haven't brought up in the pattern

441
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:02,847
Just kind of boring

442
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:04,895
I don't really know how to do

443
00:21:05,151 --> 00:21:05,663
Describing is a soda

444
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:07,455
Bland

445
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:08,479
No

446
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:09,503
I think he's better

447
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:10,527
Is a little more engaging

448
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:11,551
David

449
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:14,111
He just has like a newscaster who happen

450
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:14,879
Comes to work at

451
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:15,647
Infowars

452
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:18,464
Surprise

453
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:27,424
I'm not saying pain center of him

454
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:28,448
Lycamobile

455
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,520
And then for a bit

456
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:35,104
Owen Shroyer is in for a little bit

457
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:35,872
Black ice

458
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:37,664
Sucks like I is the worst

459
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:40,736
But we deal with Owen Shroyer

460
00:21:40,992 --> 00:21:42,016
Single

461
00:21:43,296 --> 00:21:49,440
Fairly similar to our friend Betty Ryan

462
00:21:49,952 --> 00:21:51,232
And then also he's just

463
00:21:51,488 --> 00:21:53,024
Like in the same way to Paul Joseph Watson

464
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,560
Is so manipulative about

465
00:21:54,816 --> 00:21:55,328
Social

466
00:21:55,584 --> 00:21:56,096
Just Warriors

467
00:21:56,352 --> 00:21:57,376
Progressive

468
00:21:57,632 --> 00:21:58,912
Causes

469
00:21:59,168 --> 00:22:01,216
Bullying

470
00:22:01,728 --> 00:22:03,008
He is using that same

471
00:22:03,264 --> 00:22:03,776
Camp

472
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:05,568
Young

473
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,104
Attractive dudes

474
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,128
Alright

475
00:22:09,152 --> 00:22:12,480
I just f****** ear alittle bit on the year using your powers

476
00:22:12,736 --> 00:22:14,784
Evil kind of motor

477
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:16,064
Anyway I feel about Leanne Mack

478
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,624
Millie Weaver

479
00:22:19,648 --> 00:22:22,464
I don't find her all that attractive

480
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:29,120
Back for a minute

481
00:22:29,632 --> 00:22:32,448
They sent her out to a protest

482
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:35,264
I bet they had a bunch

483
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,544
Clips of people like

484
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:37,568
Telling her to turn off

485
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:40,640
The camera I don't use this footage

486
00:22:40,896 --> 00:22:42,944
Don't put me on here I don't want to talk to

487
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,248
Weather like

488
00:22:45,504 --> 00:22:46,528
Hugo

489
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:56,768
Clown she literally is dressed up like Trump

490
00:22:57,024 --> 00:22:58,048
This is about

491
00:22:58,304 --> 00:23:00,352
More stuff about that. Slush fund

492
00:23:00,608 --> 00:23:01,632
Alex

493
00:23:01,888 --> 00:23:02,656
Legit

494
00:23:02,912 --> 00:23:03,680
Freaking out

495
00:23:04,192 --> 00:23:04,704
Great

496
00:23:10,592 --> 00:23:13,152
3 billion to the social justice Warriors

497
00:23:18,784 --> 00:23:19,808
Not social dress

498
00:23:20,064 --> 00:23:20,576
Warrior cause

499
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:21,600
Is a lot of it was

500
00:23:21,856 --> 00:23:23,392
Housing Council

501
00:23:25,184 --> 00:23:26,208
Stuff like that

502
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,000
Literally no.

503
00:23:28,256 --> 00:23:34,400
Invitation that any of that money went to the end of the black lives matter

504
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:38,496
Antifa stuff nothing none of that is

505
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:41,568
Go to that

506
00:23:41,824 --> 00:23:42,592
I can't prove it either way

507
00:23:43,104 --> 00:23:46,176
Absolutely no proof

508
00:23:46,432 --> 00:23:47,712
Claiming it is alive

509
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:49,760
Prima facie

510
00:23:50,016 --> 00:23:50,528
Social justice

511
00:23:51,552 --> 00:23:52,064
Flip a coin

512
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,856
Do you want to try and get poor people housing

513
00:23:54,112 --> 00:23:56,416
How's the homeless your social justice

514
00:23:56,672 --> 00:23:57,696
Just Warriors

515
00:23:57,952 --> 00:23:59,232
You can get angry at Social

516
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:07,936
Well it's not because it's a trick try to get you into communism would get you into socialism which isn't real

517
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:09,472
It's just a globalist

518
00:24:09,728 --> 00:24:10,240
Slavery

519
00:24:13,056 --> 00:24:13,824
Spiel

520
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:16,896
Hundreds of millions of dollars in some cases was 386 billion

521
00:24:17,152 --> 00:24:23,040
Wells Fargo

522
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:25,856
4 billion stolen

523
00:24:26,624 --> 00:24:31,744
Then they take the money and they give it to social justice Warriors the country take our guns

524
00:24:34,304 --> 00:24:40,448
Upon upon upon crime they shut off almost 1,000

525
00:24:47,104 --> 00:24:49,920
Don't forget Obamacare

526
00:24:51,968 --> 00:24:53,504
Don't forget it

527
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:57,600
That's Darren mcbreen and he is he's just sitting there the entire time like

528
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,952
He's doing little takes to the camera and stuff.

529
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:03,232
Out here too

530
00:25:16,032 --> 00:25:20,128
Thunder stop

531
00:25:20,384 --> 00:25:23,200
Smart

532
00:25:23,456 --> 00:25:23,968
Is he listening

533
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:30,624
Everybody whatever you here

534
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,672
You got to finish your drink

535
00:25:43,424 --> 00:25:45,472
Weather

536
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:53,408
Tell me I'm fat.

537
00:25:57,504 --> 00:25:59,296
I'm the opposite.

538
00:25:59,552 --> 00:26:01,088
Sentence

539
00:26:01,856 --> 00:26:05,952
If

540
00:26:11,584 --> 00:26:12,608
What do you think about them

541
00:26:15,424 --> 00:26:16,960
What do you think the plan is

542
00:26:31,808 --> 00:26:33,344
He does not use what is it what is it

543
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,624
She comes from the rainbow smash

544
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:41,024
Improv good normal losses

545
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:41,792
Possibly thing

546
00:26:42,304 --> 00:26:47,424
Text to Alex Jones as it goes like

547
00:26:47,936 --> 00:26:49,216
Ruined

548
00:26:49,472 --> 00:26:49,984
My

549
00:26:50,496 --> 00:26:52,032
Possible career test

550
00:26:52,288 --> 00:26:54,592
I can't go anywhere else

551
00:26:55,104 --> 00:26:56,384
Like I might say

552
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:59,456
Have been on Infowars as a reporter

553
00:26:59,968 --> 00:27:03,552
I'm done the only opportunity the only option I have

554
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,368
Yes one

555
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:07,136
The only

556
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:11,744
Jettisoning he could possibly do is start his own like YouTube channel

557
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,024
And kind of go

558
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:16,864
A little while

559
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:19,936
Play cuz there's no credibility anywhere to be found

560
00:27:20,192 --> 00:27:22,496
If he does try to get a job at like

561
00:27:22,752 --> 00:27:26,592
Call MSNBC

562
00:27:26,848 --> 00:27:27,616
They're going to take it

563
00:27:28,384 --> 00:27:29,152
Play that clip

564
00:27:30,176 --> 00:27:32,224
Also he brought up this

565
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:35,040
Fake news this weird narrative

566
00:27:35,552 --> 00:27:40,416
You were confused at the 20th Century Fox theme.

567
00:27:42,976 --> 00:27:49,120
We're so lucky that there's the internet though because I'm thinking a lot of that lot of what we're seeing right now is Backlash for 4

568
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:53,728
Trump being elected

569
00:27:53,984 --> 00:27:57,568
And getting Trump elected

570
00:27:58,336 --> 00:27:58,848
The internet

571
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:05,504
That would probably be looking at a Jeb Bush presidency or God forbid

572
00:28:09,344 --> 00:28:15,488
Let's not start

573
00:28:20,608 --> 00:28:26,752
They celebrated the course we all celebrated as soon as Trump was elected and now the battle has just begun

574
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:31,360
He goes a little bit further about their role and Trump

575
00:28:31,616 --> 00:28:32,128
Election

576
00:28:32,384 --> 00:28:38,528
Later

577
00:28:38,784 --> 00:28:41,600
You want to make the argument you're not a propaganda

578
00:28:41,856 --> 00:28:47,488
Number why Admiral got ripped

579
00:28:47,744 --> 00:28:49,280
Like the idea behind

580
00:28:49,536 --> 00:28:50,304
The fake news

581
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:52,352
Meme or the term is

582
00:28:52,608 --> 00:28:53,888
Propaganda

583
00:28:54,144 --> 00:28:55,680
It's not about like

584
00:28:56,192 --> 00:28:56,704
All these

585
00:28:57,728 --> 00:28:59,264

Just called propaganda

591
00:29:07,968 --> 00:29:08,736
To me is more like

592
00:29:09,504 --> 00:29:14,880
700 tallest terrorizes Infowars Church

593
00:29:15,136 --> 00:29:18,208

595
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,888
Alright Alex does propaganda

596
00:29:26,144 --> 00:29:26,912
He doesn't

597
00:29:27,168 --> 00:29:28,960
Understand that that's what people are saying

598
00:29:29,472 --> 00:29:29,984
And so he

599
00:29:31,264 --> 00:29:32,544
Dutifully serves

600
00:29:33,312 --> 00:29:34,080
Every propaganda

601
00:29:34,592 --> 00:29:38,432
NTR

602
00:29:40,224 --> 00:29:41,248
The fake stream media

603
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,832
There's just no Escape calling the propaganda

604
00:29:47,136 --> 00:29:48,416

00:30:01,728 --> 00:30:03,776
1880 for every single day

608
00:30:04,032 --> 00:30:06,592
Making up words

609
00:30:06,848 --> 00:30:08,384
Newspeak b*******

610
00:30:09,664 --> 00:30:12,224

From The New York Times

613
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:25,280
20th Century Fox used fake news to publicize a new movie called

614
00:30:25,536 --> 00:30:26,304
A cure for wellness

615
00:30:27,328 --> 00:30:30,144
Put up

616
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:30,912
Fake site

617
00:30:31,424 --> 00:30:33,728
They were filled with advertisements for their movies

618
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:34,752
With

619
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:39,872
Knowing that people would repost these articles

620
00:30:40,384 --> 00:30:42,432

621
00:30:42,944 --> 00:30:43,456

00:30:51,136 --> 00:30:51,904
But there

626
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:56,768
Trying to

00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:59,328
Lander Infowars or anything like that

628
00:30:59,584 --> 00:31:01,632
Rationalization

629
00:31:01,888 --> 00:31:02,400
Confirm this article

630
00:31:04,704 --> 00:31:06,496
A cure for wellness is a movie about a fake

631
00:31:06,752 --> 00:31:07,520
That makes

632
00:31:07,776 --> 00:31:08,288
People sticker

633
00:31:08,544 --> 00:31:09,312
Their statement said

634
00:31:09,568 --> 00:31:10,336
As a part of this

635
00:31:10,592 --> 00:31:11,616

Wish.com

638

639
00:31:16,224 --> 00:31:17,504

Both made jokes online about the phenomenon fake news

647
00:31:36,704 --> 00:31:38,496
The film opens on Friday and has received

648
00:31:38,752 --> 00:31:40,032
Mostly negative reviews

649
00:31:40,544 --> 00:31:41,312
What critic

650
00:31:44,128 --> 00:31:44,896
Of the Daily News

651
00:31:45,152 --> 00:31:48,480
Describe it's Preposterous Gothic nonsense

652
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:53,600
Sound more interesting

653
00:31:55,392 --> 00:31:56,416
Preposterous

654
00:32:00,768 --> 00:32:02,816
Samina

655
00:32:03,072 --> 00:32:04,864
Clue was set in Transylvania

656
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:07,680
Preposterous

657
00:32:09,216 --> 00:32:11,520
You get with like we're making a mountain out of a mole cat

658
00:32:11,776 --> 00:32:12,288
Yeah

659
00:32:13,568 --> 00:32:15,360
If I work all this article also

660
00:32:15,616 --> 00:32:16,384
Has a list of

661
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:17,408
A bunch of the headline

662
00:32:18,176 --> 00:32:21,504
Are they are they wildly obvious

663
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:23,040
In there fake attitude

664
00:32:23,296 --> 00:32:23,808
Stopwatch

665
00:32:24,064 --> 00:32:26,112
Leaked Lady Gaga halftime performance

666
00:32:26,368 --> 00:32:27,392
The future Muslim tribute

667
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:33,536
Kind of believable in NFL

668
00:32:33,792 --> 00:32:36,608
Done that maybe California legislature to

669
00:32:36,864 --> 00:32:39,168
Considered abortion

670
00:32:39,936 --> 00:32:43,008
So basically they just have these Hot Topic but you shoes

671
00:32:43,264 --> 00:32:44,800
And they know that people are going to be like

672
00:32:45,056 --> 00:32:47,616
Read this s***

673
00:32:50,432 --> 00:32:52,992
You don't like I agree with you 100% that it's bad

674
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:55,552
It's dangerous

675
00:32:55,808 --> 00:33:01,952
Yeah it's definitely not weed it out and they're like

676
00:33:02,976 --> 00:33:06,560
We add more as a sort of parody

677
00:33:07,072 --> 00:33:07,840
Performance arts

678
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:09,632
Okay

679
00:33:11,168 --> 00:33:12,960
Marketing I'm not okay with it

680
00:33:13,216 --> 00:33:14,752
But if you take Essex out of it

681
00:33:15,008 --> 00:33:18,080
I'm really smart it's a really smart idea

682
00:33:18,336 --> 00:33:20,896
Alex is treating it as like

683
00:33:21,152 --> 00:33:21,920
This is proof

684
00:33:22,176 --> 00:33:24,992
That everybody every everything

685
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:27,552
20th Century Fox

686
00:33:27,808 --> 00:33:29,344
It's made by the globalist

687
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,136
The establishment

688
00:33:31,392 --> 00:33:32,672
Discredit Infowars

689
00:33:32,928 --> 00:33:34,208
Which is on The Cutting Edge

690
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:35,744
And that's not

691
00:33:36,256 --> 00:33:37,792
Situation at all

692
00:33:38,048 --> 00:33:38,816
Diesel

693
00:33:39,072 --> 00:33:41,120
He doesn't even understand the story he's telling

694
00:33:41,376 --> 00:33:42,656
Darren mcbreen

695
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:47,008
Is on the show to break this news it's just

696
00:33:47,264 --> 00:33:52,384
I love I love how he's on the show to break this news that has spoken all of 10

697
00:33:54,944 --> 00:33:56,992
The end where

698
00:33:58,016 --> 00:33:58,784
Pivot

699
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:00,320
The conversation weirdly to say

700
00:34:00,576 --> 00:34:02,112
Play some really bad stuff about CIA

701
00:34:03,648 --> 00:34:07,232
Exactly right the mainstream media has been caught red-handed

702
00:34:07,488 --> 00:34:09,536
Create a fake News website

703
00:34:09,792 --> 00:34:15,936
That's not that and they're completely made up stories that were spread online

704
00:34:16,192 --> 00:34:17,728
People on Facebook and Twitter

705
00:34:17,984 --> 00:34:18,496
Because

706
00:34:18,752 --> 00:34:19,520
Alex

707
00:34:19,776 --> 00:34:24,128
And feel like the real thing they look like traditional mainstream media websites

708
00:34:24,384 --> 00:34:26,432
That's a fair point but I never saw any of

709
00:34:26,944 --> 00:34:33,088
What's the weather forecast for maybe but not within our Circle

710
00:34:36,672 --> 00:34:37,696
Somebody's going to share some dumps

711
00:34:38,464 --> 00:34:39,232
The champagne start

712
00:34:39,488 --> 00:34:41,280
Feel real good right about now

713
00:34:42,048 --> 00:34:44,096
Check out the names of some of these websites

714
00:34:44,352 --> 00:34:46,656
Salt Lake City Guardian the Houston leader

715
00:34:46,912 --> 00:34:48,192
Sacramento dispatch

716
00:34:48,448 --> 00:34:51,264
New York morning post and the Indianapolis Gazette

717
00:34:51,776 --> 00:34:54,080
I guess it looks and feels like a legitimate website

718
00:34:54,336 --> 00:35:00,480
Trump spotted at Swiss Resort

719
00:35:01,248 --> 00:35:02,528
The election

720
00:35:02,784 --> 00:35:07,136
Inasmuch as like

721
00:35:07,392 --> 00:35:07,904
That last one

722
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:08,928
Especially is really yours

723
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:14,816
Possible to discredit Infowars or anything like that it's strictly

724
00:35:15,072 --> 00:35:15,584
Ted mark

725
00:35:18,912 --> 00:35:19,424
No we don't

726
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:24,544
Really need help from them

727
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:28,896
And it's not the mainstream media it's a corporation its threat

728
00:35:29,152 --> 00:35:31,200
Can Corporation to realize me

729
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:33,760

Some guy

733
00:35:43,744 --> 00:35:44,768
Probably came up with

734
00:35:45,536 --> 00:35:46,048
You know what

735
00:35:46,304 --> 00:35:48,096
Everyone shares bulshit online

736
00:35:48,608 --> 00:35:49,632
What if we could use

737
00:35:49,888 --> 00:35:50,912
Totally get it in the head

738
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:53,728
With all these ads on these sites that

739
00:35:53,984 --> 00:35:55,520

00:36:06,272 --> 00:36:07,296
Also like

744
00:36:07,552 --> 00:36:10,112
I didn't see any of these websites cuz they've all been taken down

745
00:36:10,624 --> 00:36:12,416
Course good but I would have to ask

746
00:36:13,696 --> 00:36:14,208
Person

747
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:15,744
I know there's not many of us left

748
00:36:16,256 --> 00:36:18,304
But if you went to the website

749
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:19,328

Sacramento dispatch

757
00:36:45,184 --> 00:36:47,488
A news organization that does

Not exist there's no such thing

759
00:36:50,304 --> 00:36:56,448
California Federal support in midst of a natural....

That's their clickbait

761
00:36:57,984 --> 00:37:02,592
What happens if you don't got one side

64 popping up a lot of people were sharing them

764
00:37:07,968 --> 00:37:10,528
Totally oblivious to the fact that they were sharing

765
00:37:10,784 --> 00:37:12,576
And spreading fake news

766
00:37:13,088 --> 00:37:13,600
Here's the headline

767
00:37:14,624 --> 00:37:17,184
Mcbreen has Dumb Friends

768
00:37:17,696 --> 00:37:18,720
The story

769
00:37:18,976 --> 00:37:24,864
Because his friends as well

770
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:27,680

That would be legal back then

790
00:38:30,144 --> 00:38:31,680
Had three thousand plus

791
00:38:32,192 --> 00:38:37,056
CIA agents imbedded in mainstream media growing up in Texas and Dallas

792
00:38:37,312 --> 00:38:38,848
You couldn't swing a stick

793
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:51,904
Was electronic back then

794
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:52,672
Best and brightest

795
00:38:52,928 --> 00:38:55,232

799
00:39:15,712 --> 00:39:17,504
Classified information

800
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:23,392
You don't want to deal with that

801
00:39:23,648 --> 00:39:24,160
Alex

802
00:39:24,416 --> 00:39:26,720
You are not being recruited by the sea

803
00:39:27,744 --> 00:39:30,048
He was younger

804
00:39:33,376 --> 00:39:35,936
Yoked

805
00:39:36,192 --> 00:39:37,728
You wouldn't imagine

806
00:39:41,056 --> 00:39:41,568
F******

807
00:39:41,824 --> 00:39:47,968

808
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:53,088
Anger at Alex

809
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:07,424
His argument is there they're in control of it

810
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:15,360
Agencies

811
00:40:19,968 --> 00:40:20,992
Domestically

812
00:40:21,248 --> 00:40:27,392
Filled with all the Liberals and social justice Warriors that have been packed in there under Obama and under Bill Clinton and under

813
00:40:28,672 --> 00:40:33,280
And they literally are Waging War against us

814
00:40:37,376 --> 00:40:39,680
To run wise against Trump

815
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:50,944
As even in their own examples most of them we're not

816
00:40:54,272 --> 00:40:55,552
Trolley Hop On

817
00:40:57,600 --> 00:41:00,928
One of them is California gives tax cut

818
00:41:01,184 --> 00:41:02,976
Abortion

819
00:41:08,864 --> 00:41:10,400
Keep in mind that question

820
00:41:10,656 --> 00:41:13,216
Find out about that

821
00:41:13,472 --> 00:41:18,336
I want to know where you found out about it also keep in mind

822
00:41:18,592 --> 00:41:19,616
Spring break

823
00:41:19,872 --> 00:41:21,664
Nobody else

824
00:41:22,176 --> 00:41:26,784
Promoting a new movie that's coming out called cure for wellness

825
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:28,064
But like I said

826
00:41:28,576 --> 00:41:30,368
This is I think it's more than that

827
00:41:30,624 --> 00:41:32,160
Because

828
00:41:32,672 --> 00:41:37,024
It's not slander also it's more than that

829
00:41:37,792 --> 00:41:39,072
Promoting a movie

830
00:41:39,328 --> 00:41:39,840
Also

831
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:47,264
Oh my God I'm making up for some Admiral Ship

832
00:41:50,592 --> 00:41:51,872
20th Century Fox

833
00:41:52,128 --> 00:41:55,455
Two fake news combat their fake news

834
00:41:56,479 --> 00:41:56,991
Yeah

835
00:41:57,247 --> 00:41:57,759
Okay

836
00:41:58,015 --> 00:41:58,527
We did it

837
00:41:59,039 --> 00:42:03,135
Bye-bye is snow blown

838
00:42:03,647 --> 00:42:07,999
Holding out of fake article not telling you it's at the bottom

839
00:42:09,535 --> 00:42:11,327
I can't confirm or deny whether it didn't

840
00:42:13,887 --> 00:42:14,399
Because you really should

841
00:42:15,167 --> 00:42:16,703
That's inappropriate

842
00:42:16,959 --> 00:42:17,471
That isn't

843
00:42:17,983 --> 00:42:18,495
Well

844
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:21,311
The onion doesn't have

845
00:42:21,567 --> 00:42:22,079
How to say

846
00:42:22,335 --> 00:42:25,407
At the bottom of every article and by the way this is not

847
00:42:25,663 --> 00:42:28,991
Information

848
00:42:29,247 --> 00:42:30,271
This article

849
00:42:34,879 --> 00:42:38,207
It's absolutely

850
00:42:38,719 --> 00:42:44,351
Well New York Times cover did Washington Post cover

851
00:42:53,567 --> 00:42:56,127

People

854
00:43:09,951 --> 00:43:11,231
We know where you got it

855
00:43:13,023 --> 00:43:15,071
That trumps order the CIA

856
00:43:17,887 --> 00:43:20,703
All the soldiers all the operatives

857
00:43:26,847 --> 00:43:29,663
But they're in there with all the

858
00:43:40,927 --> 00:43:42,975
Trouble

859
00:43:49,375 --> 00:43:50,399
Hold on

But they're the ones in there

868
00:45:13,855 --> 00:45:14,879
Alex does

869
00:45:16,159 --> 00:45:22,303
What kind of lame like

870
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:23,327

871
00:45:23,583 --> 00:45:24,351
All of his b

873
00:45:26,911 --> 00:45:30,239
Utter Insanity American flag

874
00:45:30,495 --> 00:45:33,823
Yes and then they were like wait till Obama

875
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:35,359
Got them the wood carved America

876
00:45:35,871 --> 00:45:36,639
Trump

877
00:45:38,687 --> 00:45:43,039
What was the reveal at the end of that there was a receipt for the reveal was

878
00:45:43,551 --> 00:45:45,087
Foundation chicken neck

879
00:45:51,743 --> 00:45:53,279
These gifts and then they're like oh

880
00:45:53,535 --> 00:45:55,327
Used government money it's a bribe

881
00:45:55,839 --> 00:45:56,351
I want

882
00:45:56,607 --> 00:45:59,679
People stay behind and show them a receipt that proved

883
00:45:59,935 --> 00:46:01,983
Trump paid for it with his own money

884
00:46:02,239 --> 00:46:03,519
April 8th couldn't get them

885
00:46:03,775 --> 00:46:05,311
With Miss

886
00:46:07,103 --> 00:46:08,895
What

887
00:46:09,151 --> 00:46:11,199
Play-Doh poop

888
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:15,807
Okay

889
00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:20,415
If you didn't hear what could possibly what kind of water

890
00:46:20,927 --> 00:46:24,511
Aveda near from Trump I don't know where that could have come from

891
00:46:29,375 --> 00:46:32,959
AC coils

892
00:46:35,263 --> 00:46:36,287
Dumbass

893
00:46:36,543 --> 00:46:38,847
Also that the analysts are there

894
00:46:39,103 --> 00:46:40,639
And they're excited

895
00:46:40,895 --> 00:46:41,919
Thrilled

896
00:46:42,175 --> 00:46:42,943
Trump

897
00:46:43,711 --> 00:46:47,551
Because he bought them a total of like $100 worth

898
00:46:48,575 --> 00:46:50,367
Wooden American flag Americana

899
00:46:50,623 --> 00:46:56,767
They were going to licking their lips

900
00:46:57,023 --> 00:46:58,303
Using government funds

901
00:46:58,559 --> 00:46:59,839
Knick knack

902
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:01,887
And we got

903
00:47:03,423 --> 00:47:06,239
Supposed to be all over this

904
00:47:07,263 --> 00:47:08,287
So stupid

905
00:47:08,543 --> 00:47:11,103
Bric-a-brac

906
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:12,895
Know that

907
00:47:13,407 --> 00:47:14,431
White also

908
00:47:15,455 --> 00:47:16,223
If I know me

909
00:47:18,015 --> 00:47:19,039
They were prochnow

910
00:47:19,295 --> 00:47:21,599
Probably very disappointed

911
00:47:22,111 --> 00:47:22,879
Not to have receipt

912
00:47:23,135 --> 00:47:23,903
Steve their own breaker

913
00:47:24,159 --> 00:47:27,999
Bric-a-brac as well I'm not sure if

914
00:47:28,511 --> 00:47:29,535
It's unclear from the clip

915
00:47:30,047 --> 00:47:30,815
Nobody knows about

916
00:47:31,071 --> 00:47:35,423
I should be talking about

917
00:47:36,703 --> 00:47:37,215
Right

918
00:47:39,007 --> 00:47:39,519
Could not

919
00:47:39,775 --> 00:47:45,919
Possibly be lower let's be honest only kind of makes Trump look good

920
00:47:46,175 --> 00:47:47,199
Good

921
00:47:47,455 --> 00:47:53,599
It's actually kind of funny it's a funny story

922
00:47:56,671 --> 00:47:59,743
If there was documentation of these chicken Nick analyst

923
00:47:59,999 --> 00:48:01,279
Freaking out

924
00:48:01,535 --> 00:48:03,583
Kind of indicate that there is some truth

925
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:04,863
That there is a schism

926
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:06,655
Give me a community

927
00:48:06,911 --> 00:48:08,447
Some people want to take him down and some don't

928
00:48:12,031 --> 00:48:14,335
What anyway

929
00:48:14,591 --> 00:48:15,871
Interesting so far off course

930
00:48:19,711 --> 00:48:21,503
Time to pay the bill

931
00:48:21,759 --> 00:48:24,831
We got to go to an adherent

932
00:48:31,487 --> 00:48:35,839
I think there's some indication

933
00:48:37,631 --> 00:48:39,935
We did sell out of all the Ronald Reagan

934
00:48:41,983 --> 00:48:43,519
Donald Trump lithograph

935
00:48:46,335 --> 00:48:47,871
We're about to sell out of Tennessee

936
00:48:48,639 --> 00:48:50,431
Firearms lowers rimforest

937
00:48:53,247 --> 00:48:56,063
With public reborn 45th president of today's

938
00:48:56,319 --> 00:48:57,087
Donald J Trump

939
00:48:57,343 --> 00:49:00,671
They're only a couple hundred left to those of the one out of 1000

940
00:49:00,927 --> 00:49:02,463
It is a collector's item

941
00:49:02,719 --> 00:49:08,607
You drill this out this is your airline this is for you that's how you legally have it with the ATF letter there

942
00:49:08,863 --> 00:49:12,959
Metal check your local laws it's all there infowarsstore.com

943
00:49:13,727 --> 00:49:14,751
Yeah

944
00:49:21,151 --> 00:49:22,431
Check your local laws

945
00:49:22,943 --> 00:49:25,503
Probably don't even know if that letter is real

946
00:49:25,759 --> 00:49:28,575
A policy wonk would probably know the local laws

947
00:49:28,831 --> 00:49:34,207
Actually all of the analysts inside and forwards were really excited

948
00:49:34,463 --> 00:49:34,975
They're like

949
00:49:35,231 --> 00:49:37,791
We finally got you on this one Alex Jones

950
00:49:39,071 --> 00:49:39,839
I love you so awesome

951
00:49:40,095 --> 00:49:42,655
Towards

952
00:49:43,679 --> 00:49:45,471
So yeah I don't

953
00:49:45,727 --> 00:49:46,239
I don't know if

954
00:49:46,495 --> 00:49:47,775
If it's legal or not I don't really care

955
00:49:48,031 --> 00:49:50,079
I know that it's only a matter of time

956
00:49:50,335 --> 00:49:51,103
Before they sell guns

957
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:52,383
If it is legal

958
00:49:52,639 --> 00:49:53,151
The

959
00:49:53,407 --> 00:49:55,199
Idea of a human being

960
00:49:55,967 --> 00:49:58,015
With a republic Reborn

961
00:49:58,527 --> 00:49:59,039
Donald Trump

962
00:49:59,551 --> 00:50:00,063
Camp gun

963
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:02,111
Lady pantsed

964
00:50:02,367 --> 00:50:03,391
Scariest

965
00:50:04,671 --> 00:50:10,815
711

966
00:50:11,071 --> 00:50:12,095
Use to murder you and I

967
00:50:12,351 --> 00:50:15,935
What is an ironic

968
00:50:19,263 --> 00:50:23,871
Swing about fftt makes it through this this whole thing

969
00:50:24,127 --> 00:50:24,639
Republic 2

970
00:50:25,151 --> 00:50:26,431
Donald Trump

971
00:50:26,687 --> 00:50:27,455
Who's my second favorite

972
00:50:27,711 --> 00:50:29,247
D&C after delivery

973
00:50:30,783 --> 00:50:33,087
Either the conditioner

974
00:50:38,207 --> 00:50:39,487
Cuz Alex Jones

975
00:50:39,743 --> 00:50:40,255
I think it's talk

976
00:50:40,511 --> 00:50:41,791
Talking about himself a little bit and

977
00:50:42,047 --> 00:50:43,071
Miss clip

978
00:50:43,583 --> 00:50:44,863
That wasn't an ironic

979
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:46,143
That was a fitting

980
00:50:46,911 --> 00:50:47,679
Ironic does not mean

981
00:50:48,191 --> 00:50:51,775
How to engage

982
00:50:52,287 --> 00:50:52,799
Globalist

983
00:50:53,055 --> 00:50:53,567
Okay

984
00:50:54,847 --> 00:51:00,479
The only winning move is to not play

985
00:51:00,735 --> 00:51:03,295
They set the rules they set up a

986
00:51:04,063 --> 00:51:05,343
Cultural construct

987
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:06,879
That breaks the social

988
00:51:07,135 --> 00:51:07,903
Contract

989
00:51:08,159 --> 00:51:09,695
Any is anti-human

990
00:51:12,255 --> 00:51:13,535
Slavery based

991
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:15,839
Technocracy base

992
00:51:17,631 --> 00:51:18,911
Throughout its entire

993
00:51:19,167 --> 00:51:19,679
System

994
00:51:20,191 --> 00:51:20,959
Specific

995
00:51:21,215 --> 00:51:24,031
Dixie laid out at the end there necessarily or him talking about himself

996
00:51:24,287 --> 00:51:25,311
But that don't engage

997
00:51:25,567 --> 00:51:26,847
Do they have a fake world

998
00:51:28,383 --> 00:51:29,663
Sacrifice for us

999
00:51:32,735 --> 00:51:33,503
Quite literally

1000
00:51:35,039 --> 00:51:37,087
All he's ever done is engaged

1001
00:51:37,343 --> 00:51:38,111
Global that's right

1002
00:51:38,623 --> 00:51:40,159
What movie not one-on-one

1003
00:51:40,671 --> 00:51:42,207
Maybe not actually debating

1004
00:51:45,279 --> 00:51:48,351
Putting himself as the the opponent

1005
00:51:49,887 --> 00:51:56,031
Okay so so git ology of the

1006
00:51:57,823 --> 00:52:03,967
Basically his boys don't do what I've done

1007
00:52:09,855 --> 00:52:10,367
My life

1008
00:52:10,623 --> 00:52:11,903
To think there are those quiet moment

1009
00:52:13,439 --> 00:52:14,719
Those moments where he's just like

1010
00:52:15,743 --> 00:52:17,535
Just laying in bed with a soft dick

1011
00:52:18,047 --> 00:52:20,351
Waiting for the second Super male to kick in

1012
00:52:20,607 --> 00:52:21,375
Movies like

1013
00:52:23,935 --> 00:52:24,703
Was it worth it

1014
00:52:25,727 --> 00:52:31,103
Did I am I cuz I think I might

1015
00:52:31,359 --> 00:52:34,175
The idea that he never had that moment of doubt

1016
00:52:34,687 --> 00:52:35,199
Terrified

1017
00:52:35,455 --> 00:52:35,967
Me more than anything

1018
00:52:36,479 --> 00:52:38,271
Yeah

1019
00:52:38,527 --> 00:52:39,039
To be an imposition

1020
00:52:39,295 --> 00:52:44,415
We're doing this now I have a moment

1021
00:52:45,951 --> 00:52:50,303
Are we going to be in terrible moments of insecurity

1022
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:52,607
Sometimes

1023
00:52:57,215 --> 00:52:59,263
Very fast

1024
00:52:59,519 --> 00:53:01,055
Trust

1025
00:53:01,311 --> 00:53:02,079
Myself

1026
00:53:02,335 --> 00:53:04,639
Is just the natural byproduct of it is like

1027
00:53:07,711 --> 00:53:12,063
He's cool with weed legalization

1028
00:53:14,879 --> 00:53:18,719
I think billionaires are a group of global

1029
00:53:19,743 --> 00:53:21,023
Maybe we're wrong

1030
00:53:24,095 --> 00:53:24,607
Stuff

1031
00:53:24,863 --> 00:53:26,143
30 and then the big

1032
00:53:26,399 --> 00:53:29,983
Corner city being that we are

1033
00:53:30,751 --> 00:53:32,287
Aggressively self-aware

1034
00:53:32,543 --> 00:53:34,335
To the point that even with abs

1035
00:53:34,591 --> 00:53:35,871
Absolutely 100% right

1036
00:53:36,383 --> 00:53:36,895
We will

1037
00:53:37,151 --> 00:53:38,943
Really yell at ourselves like

1038
00:53:39,199 --> 00:53:39,967
Maybe wrong

1039
00:53:40,223 --> 00:53:42,015
Baby Alive critical

1040
00:53:42,271 --> 00:53:43,295
Skills

1041
00:53:44,319 --> 00:53:46,111
Digging we're doing into him

1042
00:53:46,367 --> 00:53:48,159
We do ten times more to ourselves

1043
00:53:48,415 --> 00:53:49,439
Anyway

1044
00:53:51,231 --> 00:53:52,511
The next freakout videos

1045
00:53:52,767 --> 00:53:54,047
This one's good also

1046
00:53:55,839 --> 00:53:56,863
The Russians

1047
00:53:57,119 --> 00:53:57,631
Situation

1048
00:54:01,471 --> 00:54:03,007
Now my note that I have here is

1049
00:54:03,519 --> 00:54:04,031
David Knight

1050
00:54:04,543 --> 00:54:05,055
Studio

1051
00:54:05,567 --> 00:54:06,335
For this clip

1052
00:54:08,127 --> 00:54:09,663
David Knight

1053
00:54:10,175 --> 00:54:11,967
The fuckout starts

1054
00:54:12,479 --> 00:54:13,247
You just can't get a word in

1055
00:54:15,295 --> 00:54:16,575
This is on

1056
00:54:16,831 --> 00:54:18,367
Believer

1057
00:54:18,623 --> 00:54:24,767
We just keep learning more and more and more and more meanwhile the big Scandal go to this town

1058
00:54:42,175 --> 00:54:44,223
Mini more life

1059
00:54:59,071 --> 00:55:04,703
Specifically

1060
00:55:14,175 --> 00:55:16,479
Tops

1061
00:55:21,087 --> 00:55:27,231
Just revealed why it is it what is okay and what is that what do you mean

1062
00:55:28,255 --> 00:55:29,279
She had all of these meetings

1063
00:55:29,535 --> 00:55:31,839
Add all of these meetings Obama had all these

1064
00:55:32,863 --> 00:55:35,423
Sessions only has two and then he lied about it

1065
00:55:35,679 --> 00:55:40,287
Wilshire

1066
00:55:40,799 --> 00:55:42,591
Is the Russian

1067
00:55:47,455 --> 00:55:50,527
Based on what

1068
00:55:50,783 --> 00:55:53,855
And it's not true

1069
00:55:54,111 --> 00:55:55,391
How he would respond

1070
00:55:55,647 --> 00:55:56,927
Attorney General

1071
00:55:57,183 --> 00:55:57,951
About it

1072
00:55:58,207 --> 00:55:59,231
These things came out

1073
00:55:59,487 --> 00:56:01,279
Which is even crazier because then

1074
00:56:04,095 --> 00:56:05,375
Denies having nut

1075
00:56:05,887 --> 00:56:08,191
Which is very suspicious he doesn't answer the question

1076
00:56:08,447 --> 00:56:10,495
Different

1077
00:56:11,775 --> 00:56:13,823
Look Brown

1078
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:17,407
Surrogate before

1079
00:56:19,711 --> 00:56:20,991
Used campaign funds

1080
00:56:21,247 --> 00:56:24,063
Nobody else

1081
00:56:24,319 --> 00:56:25,343
Committed

1082
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:27,391
His record

1083
00:56:27,647 --> 00:56:29,951
Silver price

1084
00:56:31,743 --> 00:56:32,511
Things are about

1085
00:56:32,767 --> 00:56:33,279
The contact

1086
00:56:34,303 --> 00:56:35,071
Text Matt

1087
00:56:35,327 --> 00:56:36,351
Right now

1088
00:56:36,607 --> 00:56:38,399
And the lying part is a big

1089
00:56:38,655 --> 00:56:41,471
I have both

1090
00:56:41,727 --> 00:56:42,239
Come out

1091
00:56:42,751 --> 00:56:43,775
Address to these sort of

1092
00:56:44,031 --> 00:56:44,799
Argument

1093
00:56:45,311 --> 00:56:49,151
What he's yelling about Alice's yelling about is about a post on Drudge

1094
00:56:49,663 --> 00:56:52,223
The Trump also saw and tweeted about you

1095
00:56:52,479 --> 00:56:54,271
You talk about how we need to invest

1096
00:56:56,575 --> 00:56:58,879
It's like okay you don't understand how logic

1097
00:56:59,391 --> 00:57:01,951
You think you're doing a syllogism here you're not

1098
00:57:02,207 --> 00:57:05,791
FedEx

1099
00:57:06,303 --> 00:57:06,815
Colon

1100
00:57:07,327 --> 00:57:07,839
Iran

1101
00:57:09,375 --> 00:57:15,007
The most logical person in the world

1102
00:57:15,263 --> 00:57:16,543
Years of college

1103
00:57:20,127 --> 00:57:22,175
Most-loved

1104
00:57:26,271 --> 00:57:28,319
Understand

1105
00:57:28,575 --> 00:57:29,599
How logicworks

1106
00:57:32,671 --> 00:57:33,695
But I'm a little bit

1107
00:57:33,951 --> 00:57:35,231
No problem

1108
00:57:35,487 --> 00:57:37,279
Is impressed by you knowing about love

1109
00:57:37,535 --> 00:57:40,095
You can't brag about learning about logic

1110
00:57:40,351 --> 00:57:43,167
Nobody's like

1111
00:57:43,679 --> 00:57:44,959
I just I don't even like you

1112
00:57:45,215 --> 00:57:45,727
You saying that word

1113
00:57:45,983 --> 00:57:48,799
I just need to be clear that ice I have studied

1114
00:57:49,055 --> 00:57:51,103
System of logic and how it works

1115
00:57:51,359 --> 00:57:53,407
And when people misuse it it drives me

1116
00:57:53,663 --> 00:57:59,295
Me crazy which is a big reason why we're doing the show

1117
00:58:05,951 --> 00:58:08,255
Look it's like I think one of the big problems with him

1118
00:58:08,511 --> 00:58:13,887
Is that he looks like a cold war-era spy

1119
00:58:14,143 --> 00:58:15,423
He looks like the word from

1120
00:58:17,727 --> 00:58:21,311
I'm not your body shame Russia

1121
00:58:23,615 --> 00:58:24,127
They're derusha

1122
00:58:27,455 --> 00:58:31,039
You should meet with the Russian Ambassador and I'm sure he's a cool dude

1123
00:58:32,063 --> 00:58:34,111
How many parties

1124
00:58:34,623 --> 00:58:36,159
You're the guy who comes over here and

1125
00:58:36,415 --> 00:58:40,255
And he's got great vodka and I'll be very stereotypical

1126
00:58:41,535 --> 00:58:42,047
I bet he would

1127
00:58:42,303 --> 00:58:44,607
Hangouts

1128
00:58:47,423 --> 00:58:48,191
What was discussed

1129
00:58:51,007 --> 00:58:52,543
And why

1130
00:58:53,055 --> 00:58:54,335
That's also super big

1131
00:58:56,127 --> 00:58:59,967
Obfuscated all he wants about other people meeting with someone with

1132
00:59:02,527 --> 00:59:04,575
Schumer and Pelosi of both come out in

1133
00:59:04,831 --> 00:59:05,855
Try to

1134
00:59:06,367 --> 00:59:07,903
Explain right there's a difference

1135
00:59:08,159 --> 00:59:09,183
Between public meetings

1136
00:59:09,439 --> 00:59:09,951
Private

1137
00:59:10,975 --> 00:59:13,535
There's a difference about

1138
00:59:13,791 --> 00:59:16,095
To explain there's a reason they're two different words

1139
00:59:16,351 --> 00:59:21,727
What's the difference between being a sitting senator in your official capacity that the media is

1140
00:59:21,983 --> 00:59:23,519
Informed about meeting with

1141
00:59:23,775 --> 00:59:24,287
Diplomat

1142
00:59:24,543 --> 00:59:25,567
Being

1143
00:59:26,847 --> 00:59:27,871
Legally speaking

1144
00:59:28,895 --> 00:59:29,407
Do to your youth

1145
00:59:29,663 --> 00:59:30,431
Campaign funds

1146
00:59:31,199 --> 00:59:34,271
Trump surrogate for the campaign at the time

1147
00:59:37,087 --> 00:59:37,855
Foreign affairs

1148
00:59:38,367 --> 00:59:39,647
So like

1149
00:59:39,903 --> 00:59:42,719
That would be it would be

1150
00:59:45,279 --> 00:59:45,791
Pantanal that's

1151
00:59:48,607 --> 00:59:49,887
Foreign services

1152
00:59:52,703 --> 00:59:55,007
Even in the

1153
00:59:57,567 --> 01:00:00,127
If you just said oh yeah I'm at with him a couple of times

1154
01:00:01,663 --> 01:00:02,175
Address

1155
01:00:02,431 --> 01:00:04,991
Nope

1156
01:00:05,247 --> 01:00:07,295
If you just said

1157
01:00:07,551 --> 01:00:10,367
I would take very seriously and whatever information

1158
01:00:10,623 --> 01:00:12,415
Comes out I will deal with impartial

1159
01:00:12,671 --> 01:00:13,183
Unfairly

1160
01:00:13,695 --> 01:00:14,975
If you if you just

1161
01:00:19,071 --> 01:00:21,631
Even if the news comes with Russian

1162
01:00:21,887 --> 01:00:23,679
He has not perjured himself

1163
01:00:23,935 --> 01:00:26,751
What's up committed zero felony

1164
01:00:28,543 --> 01:00:29,823
They're everybody's so stupid

1165
01:00:30,335 --> 01:00:32,383
He put himself behind the 8-ball

1166
01:00:32,639 --> 01:00:37,247
Dog that ever goes out

1167
01:00:39,807 --> 01:00:41,343
CheapTickets

1168
01:00:42,111 --> 01:00:42,879
Bespoke

1169
01:00:43,647 --> 01:00:44,671
Poorly again

1170
01:00:49,535 --> 01:00:51,839
And I didn't have a chance

1171
01:00:59,519 --> 01:01:00,287
Inline

1172
01:01:00,799 --> 01:01:03,871
Like interest once he falls I don't know who's that

1173
01:01:04,127 --> 01:01:04,639
It's all good

1174
01:01:04,895 --> 01:01:08,991
Come down

1175
01:01:09,503 --> 01:01:10,527
The sessions

1176
01:01:10,783 --> 01:01:11,551
The administration

1177
01:01:11,807 --> 01:01:12,319
Into the hole

1178
01:01:12,575 --> 01:01:13,087
How did Kushner

1179
01:01:13,343 --> 01:01:13,855
Could be next

1180
01:01:16,927 --> 01:01:17,439
Mandala

1181
01:01:17,695 --> 01:01:18,463
You seem like a text

1182
01:01:18,975 --> 01:01:19,487
Such a dick

1183
01:01:19,743 --> 01:01:22,815
Yeah

1184
01:01:23,327 --> 01:01:24,095
The point where Alex

1185
01:01:24,351 --> 01:01:25,119
Really freaks out

1186
01:01:26,399 --> 01:01:27,679
Just my favorite thing in the world

1187
01:01:29,983 --> 01:01:32,031
You lied you met with a Russian

1188
01:01:35,871 --> 01:01:37,407
AJ

1189
01:01:39,455 --> 01:01:45,599
The judge

1190
01:01:49,951 --> 01:01:53,279
Again you didn't answer the question that was stupid

1191
01:01:53,535 --> 01:01:57,631
But this doesn't make any sense

1192
01:02:03,775 --> 01:02:06,847
Directions

1193
01:02:07,359 --> 01:02:13,503
Again use campaign funds to go to the RNC which takes him outside of his role is

1194
01:02:13,759 --> 01:02:14,271
Contacts

1195
01:02:14,527 --> 01:02:17,343
Being a part of the campaign

1196
01:02:17,599 --> 01:02:21,439
Alex is lying

1197
01:02:21,695 --> 01:02:22,463
Any truth

1198
01:02:22,719 --> 01:02:28,863
While Hillary and our people are all the Russian Chinese payroll

1199
01:02:29,119 --> 01:02:34,495
Irishman

1200
01:02:43,199 --> 01:02:44,479
Blew up on

1201
01:02:47,295 --> 01:02:47,807
He didn't

1202
01:02:49,343 --> 01:02:54,207
He's talked about that are always whatever he says

1203
01:02:55,999 --> 01:02:59,839
I watch that episode it was the one where it was

1204
01:03:00,351 --> 01:03:01,375
This is a clip from

1205
01:03:03,167 --> 01:03:03,679
This was

1206
01:03:04,191 --> 01:03:05,727
Weldon interview

1207
01:03:07,519 --> 01:03:08,543
Jerome corsi

1208
01:03:08,799 --> 01:03:09,823
Was over Skype

1209
01:03:10,591 --> 01:03:12,383
Welding

1210
01:03:12,639 --> 01:03:13,663
Some of this stuff

1211
01:03:14,943 --> 01:03:15,455
He believes

1212
01:03:15,711 --> 01:03:16,735
Hillary is

1213
01:03:18,783 --> 01:03:19,295
Surrogate

1214
01:03:22,111 --> 01:03:23,647
I need

1215
01:03:23,903 --> 01:03:25,439
Information that he was going to come out with

1216
01:03:25,695 --> 01:03:26,719
Did he come out with it

1217
01:03:26,975 --> 01:03:29,535
No do it seems really important for that second

1218
01:03:32,351 --> 01:03:33,119
He had a meeting

1219
01:03:33,375 --> 01:03:35,167
To get to

1220
01:03:35,423 --> 01:03:36,447
At the beginning of the interview

1221
01:03:37,983 --> 01:03:40,287
Time with me I know you have a meeting to get to

1222
01:03:42,335 --> 01:03:46,687
He stormed is not mad after interview

1223
01:03:47,455 --> 01:03:49,247
Hillary works

1224
01:03:49,503 --> 01:03:51,551
Chinese and that his family had been

1225
01:03:51,807 --> 01:03:52,319
Threatened

1226
01:03:52,575 --> 01:03:53,087
In the past

1227
01:03:56,159 --> 01:03:57,183
Do you have a meeting

1228
01:03:57,439 --> 01:03:59,743
So you did have polonium

1229
01:04:00,511 --> 01:04:01,279
All right now

1230
01:04:04,607 --> 01:04:05,119
Anyway

1231
01:04:06,143 --> 01:04:06,655
That's not

1232
01:04:08,191 --> 01:04:11,007
Characterization of that interview with her 12 in is just natural

1233
01:04:17,663 --> 01:04:20,735
Threatened was the Vegas f****** thing I've ever heard in my life

1234
01:04:20,991 --> 01:04:25,343
All that works out about even his family being threatened in the past

1235
01:04:25,599 --> 01:04:26,879
So like

1236
01:04:32,767 --> 01:04:37,119
I'm threatened

1237
01:04:37,375 --> 01:04:39,423
Making a f****** Mountain out of a molehill.

1238
01:04:39,679 --> 01:04:43,519
And

1239
01:04:43,775 --> 01:04:44,799
Explicitly

1240
01:04:45,055 --> 01:04:45,567
Say what

1241
01:04:45,823 --> 01:04:47,871
He's talking about how he's full of s***

1242
01:04:49,151 --> 01:04:50,175
Like you just angry

1243
01:04:55,039 --> 01:05:01,183
Classified

1244
01:05:08,095 --> 01:05:10,911
So now we're

1245
01:05:12,959 --> 01:05:13,727
Okay

1246
01:05:13,983 --> 01:05:15,007
I assume

1247
01:05:15,263 --> 01:05:16,799
Is a Chinese,

1248
01:05:18,335 --> 01:05:21,151
But she was also paid off by the Russian

1249
01:05:21,663 --> 01:05:22,175
Yeah

1250
01:05:22,431 --> 01:05:27,039
So will the Russians thing is you talking about

1251
01:05:30,367 --> 01:05:31,135
Representative

1252
01:05:31,391 --> 01:05:31,903
There was

1253
01:05:32,159 --> 01:05:33,951
Canadian company

1254
01:05:35,231 --> 01:05:36,767
They have access to

1255
01:05:37,279 --> 01:05:38,303
20% of

1256
01:05:38,559 --> 01:05:40,607
Yeah yeah yeah

1257
01:05:40,863 --> 01:05:43,167
Wasn't that whenever Trump

1258
01:05:43,423 --> 01:05:43,935
There's like

1259
01:05:44,447 --> 01:05:46,495
Geranium

1260
01:05:49,823 --> 01:05:55,711
Nuclear weapons out of it.

1261
01:05:58,783 --> 01:06:01,599
Yeah but it was a deal

1262
01:06:02,111 --> 01:06:07,231
It was a deal between a Canadian company that owned these resources that happened to be in our country

1263
01:06:08,511 --> 01:06:09,791
Russian company

1264
01:06:14,399 --> 01:06:15,167
Quia formality

1265
01:06:18,239 --> 01:06:20,031
Have no authority to stop it

1266
01:06:20,543 --> 01:06:23,615
Is I understand from everything I read up on the deal

1267
01:06:23,871 --> 01:06:30,015
She's the only person the only person who could have actually been like no absolutely not have been

1268
01:06:30,527 --> 01:06:32,575
Have

1269
01:06:32,831 --> 01:06:36,671
And I assume that's what he saying about

1270
01:06:36,927 --> 01:06:38,463
These she's bought off by Russia

1271
01:06:38,719 --> 01:06:39,487
But she's actually

1272
01:06:39,743 --> 01:06:40,255
Chinese

1273
01:06:40,767 --> 01:06:42,047
How

1274
01:06:42,303 --> 01:06:43,327
Hilarious would it

1275
01:06:45,887 --> 01:06:46,655
What'd happened

1276
01:06:46,911 --> 01:06:47,423
Instead

1277
01:06:47,679 --> 01:06:48,959
Is if Hillary got elected

1278
01:06:49,727 --> 01:06:51,007
Instead of this

1279
01:06:51,263 --> 01:06:52,543
Chaos with Russia

1280
01:06:52,799 --> 01:06:56,895
China run

1281
01:06:57,919 --> 01:07:00,991
Happy wild screwed no matter what happen

1282
01:07:01,247 --> 01:07:03,039
I would love to

1283
01:07:03,551 --> 01:07:05,087
Hillary

1284
01:07:06,111 --> 01:07:06,879
First thing on my agenda

1285
01:07:07,391 --> 01:07:10,207
The rest of those frogs gay

1286
01:07:12,511 --> 01:07:14,559
More present

1287
01:07:14,815 --> 01:07:16,863
That pad in their first address

1288
01:07:18,655 --> 01:07:21,983
Schedule

1289
01:07:22,239 --> 01:07:23,263
Hillary's a Chinese

1290
01:07:24,287 --> 01:07:29,407
Has come out to their Chinese

1291
01:07:30,943 --> 01:07:37,087
Directions

1292
01:07:37,343 --> 01:07:43,487
Route of control

1293
01:07:43,743 --> 01:07:47,327
Storamerica

1294
01:07:53,215 --> 01:07:55,775
And a lobbyist

1295
01:07:59,359 --> 01:08:02,175
And the government

1296
01:08:02,431 --> 01:08:07,807
Jones & the lifters are they broadcasting

1297
01:08:12,927 --> 01:08:14,719
2 plan

1298
01:08:14,975 --> 01:08:21,119
Swimming and water

1299
01:08:23,935 --> 01:08:26,239
Into something that it wasn't as you point out he said yeah

1300
01:08:26,495 --> 01:08:32,383
I'm in Washington about the campaign

1301
01:08:32,895 --> 01:08:39,039
The same thing is true when this was he's talking to him

1302
01:08:40,831 --> 01:08:42,111
The best

1303
01:08:42,623 --> 01:08:46,463
He's clearly feeding off of Alex Jones

1304
01:08:46,719 --> 01:08:52,863
You can see in all of their face

1305
01:08:53,119 --> 01:08:54,655
Places

1306
01:08:54,911 --> 01:09:01,055
On in another Studio

1307
01:09:01,311 --> 01:09:03,871
And we're both looking

1308
01:09:05,151 --> 01:09:06,175
They both were like

1309
01:09:08,735 --> 01:09:09,503
Do you think

1310
01:09:09,759 --> 01:09:12,319
He is

1311
01:09:13,343 --> 01:09:14,879
Gotten a switch from a tree

1312
01:09:20,511 --> 01:09:21,279
You're right that's

1313
01:09:26,911 --> 01:09:28,447
So

1314
01:09:28,703 --> 01:09:30,239
Domino's one ended with a nice lie

1315
01:09:36,895 --> 01:09:39,967
It's just now he's not in an official capacity

1316
01:09:41,247 --> 01:09:41,759
We can

1317
01:09:42,015 --> 01:09:43,295
Take a little bit of a step back

1318
01:09:43,551 --> 01:09:45,599
In terms of investigating him

1319
01:09:46,111 --> 01:09:47,135
SB investigation

1320
01:09:47,391 --> 01:09:47,903
Proceed

1321
01:09:48,415 --> 01:09:50,207
All of his eyes are part of

1322
01:09:50,463 --> 01:09:51,743
No one is

1323
01:09:51,999 --> 01:09:55,839
Like being

1324
01:09:56,095 --> 01:10:02,239
He's not in the government anymore

1325
01:10:03,519 --> 01:10:04,287
Security

1326
01:10:04,799 --> 01:10:05,823
Ahead

1327
01:10:06,335 --> 01:10:09,151
That's why people are like okay we can breathe little sigh of relief

1328
01:10:09,407 --> 01:10:10,175
This guy who's

1329
01:10:10,431 --> 01:10:10,943
Clearly

1330
01:10:11,455 --> 01:10:11,967
Vincent

1331
01:10:12,223 --> 01:10:12,991
Fuckedupshit

1332
01:10:13,759 --> 01:10:15,295
He's not in the government

1333
01:10:15,551 --> 01:10:16,831
We can deal with him

1334
01:10:17,087 --> 01:10:17,599
Adorama

1335
01:10:18,623 --> 01:10:21,183
So that's why it feels like people

1336
01:10:21,439 --> 01:10:21,951
Care

1337
01:10:22,207 --> 01:10:24,255
Because we have other people we need to get out of that government

1338
01:10:25,535 --> 01:10:28,863
Real heart

1339
01:10:29,887 --> 01:10:31,167
Is there any adult

1340
01:10:31,423 --> 01:10:31,935
I've been reading

1341
01:10:32,447 --> 01:10:32,959
Constitution

1342
01:10:35,519 --> 01:10:36,287
Go Bragh

1343
01:10:41,151 --> 01:10:41,663
Can we

1344
01:10:41,919 --> 01:10:42,943
All agree

1345
01:10:43,199 --> 01:10:44,223
To add an amendment

1346
01:10:44,735 --> 01:10:45,759
That just says like

1347
01:10:47,039 --> 01:10:47,807
Sometimes

1348
01:10:48,575 --> 01:10:49,343
If we get enough votes

1349
01:10:50,367 --> 01:10:51,903
We're going to do a do-over election

1350
01:10:52,159 --> 01:10:53,695
Can we get a do-over closet

1351
01:10:53,951 --> 01:10:54,463
The Constitution

1352
01:10:54,719 --> 01:10:57,535
Idea of being able to vote no confidence

1353
01:10:59,071 --> 01:10:59,839
Confidence

1354
01:11:00,351 --> 01:11:04,959
I think we'll be a really good person we're still relying on the public

1355
01:11:05,215 --> 01:11:06,239
Like to know what's going on in there the one

1356
01:11:06,495 --> 01:11:07,263
If I can put Trump in

1357
01:11:07,519 --> 01:11:08,799
The first place

1358
01:11:09,055 --> 01:11:09,823
Based on strict

1359
01:11:10,079 --> 01:11:11,103
Numbers

1360
01:11:11,359 --> 01:11:13,663
Here's more s*** about session

1361
01:11:14,431 --> 01:11:16,991
What happened

1362
01:11:18,271 --> 01:11:23,647
Has the u.s. ranking Senator on the armed services committee is the ranking Republican

1363
01:11:23,903 --> 01:11:25,183
Directions

1364
01:11:25,695 --> 01:11:30,047
Absolutely I've met with that other top generals time

1365
01:11:30,303 --> 01:11:31,839
Just as Europe met with us

1366
01:11:42,079 --> 01:11:42,847
File

1367
01:11:43,103 --> 01:11:45,407
The last few years

1368
01:11:45,663 --> 01:11:49,247
I posted that your Senate session

1369
01:11:51,551 --> 01:11:54,111
These are public meetings are completely aboveboard

1370
01:11:56,927 --> 01:11:57,695
Chuck Schumer

1371
01:11:58,463 --> 01:11:59,743
Map of the very same person

1372
01:11:59,999 --> 01:12:02,559
Public works together right now

1373
01:12:09,471 --> 01:12:11,263
And the Republican Party

1374
01:12:11,775 --> 01:12:12,799
Donald Trump

1375
01:12:13,055 --> 01:12:14,847
I said just let us have planned

1376
01:12:15,103 --> 01:12:16,895
We'll get him off your back

1377
01:12:29,439 --> 01:12:32,511
Chat with the Democrats

1378
01:12:35,071 --> 01:12:35,839
Dead matter

1379
01:12:38,143 --> 01:12:41,471
Who's this patriotic at Americana as basically John Wayne

1380
01:12:41,983 --> 01:12:43,775
I believe that's code for white

1381
01:12:50,175 --> 01:12:51,711
Being the handlers of the Democrats

1382
01:12:53,759 --> 01:12:54,783
He's talking about like

1383
01:12:58,111 --> 01:12:59,135
Stuff that happened

1384
01:12:59,391 --> 01:13:00,159
VY qwaint

1385
01:13:00,415 --> 01:13:00,927
Durance word

1386
01:13:02,719 --> 01:13:05,023
Okay

1387
01:13:05,279 --> 01:13:06,559
Right

1388
01:13:07,583 --> 01:13:08,863
Sure sure great point

1389
01:13:09,375 --> 01:13:10,143
Not really

1390
01:13:10,399 --> 01:13:11,935
But also the Democrats were

1391
01:13:12,191 --> 01:13:12,703
Against

1392
01:13:13,215 --> 01:13:13,983
Civil rights at 1

1393
01:13:14,239 --> 01:13:14,751
Yeah

1394
01:13:15,007 --> 01:13:16,543
So

1395
01:13:16,799 --> 01:13:20,895
You know the whole parties

1396
01:13:22,431 --> 01:13:23,455
History of the parties they

1397
01:13:23,967 --> 01:13:25,247
As a party

1398
01:13:26,015 --> 01:13:28,063
Both of them have gone so far back

1399
01:13:28,319 --> 01:13:29,087
Fourth

1400
01:13:30,111 --> 01:13:30,879
Absolutely

1401
01:13:31,135 --> 01:13:33,183
And people have switched from one to the other that

1402
01:13:38,303 --> 01:13:40,863
At the boat you know if you replaced both parts

1403
01:13:41,119 --> 01:13:42,911
See how your place to sale your place of that

1404
01:13:43,167 --> 01:13:44,191
At the end of all of that is

1405
01:13:44,447 --> 01:13:45,983
Still the same boat

1406
01:13:46,239 --> 01:13:47,007
Even your body

1407
01:13:47,263 --> 01:13:48,031
Yeah exactly

1408
01:13:48,287 --> 01:13:50,335
Every 7 years your a completely different

1409
01:13:52,127 --> 01:13:54,687
To stay like all the Democrats

1410
01:13:54,943 --> 01:13:55,455
These are the same as

1411
01:13:55,711 --> 01:13:56,223
Is the Democrats

1412
01:13:56,735 --> 01:13:57,503
Today it's stupid

1413
01:14:03,647 --> 01:14:08,511
Make an argument and appeal to 70 years ago

1414
01:14:08,767 --> 01:14:10,047
Years ago you're just

1415
01:14:10,815 --> 01:14:12,095
I mean you're not even

1416
01:14:12,351 --> 01:14:17,471
Trying

1417
01:14:17,727 --> 01:14:18,751
If you were to make an

1418
01:14:19,007 --> 01:14:19,519
An argument

1419
01:14:19,775 --> 01:14:20,543
About how

1420
01:14:22,591 --> 01:14:23,359
Let's say

1421
01:14:24,127 --> 01:14:25,407
Slavery still has effects

1422
01:14:25,663 --> 01:14:26,175
Jackson you're like wow

1423
01:14:26,943 --> 01:14:27,455
I wasn't

1424
01:14:29,247 --> 01:14:29,759
Slave owners

1425
01:14:30,015 --> 01:14:32,063
Set the timer

1426
01:14:34,111 --> 01:14:34,879
It's it's like

1427
01:14:35,391 --> 01:14:36,671
Even if you make your point

1428
01:14:36,927 --> 01:14:37,695
Successful

1429
01:14:38,207 --> 01:14:38,975
It doesn't matter

1430
01:14:39,231 --> 01:14:39,999
Who cares

1431
01:14:40,511 --> 01:14:41,279
Also

1432
01:14:42,047 --> 01:14:42,559
He pitches

1433
01:14:43,071 --> 01:14:44,095
One of his nice Fanta

1434
01:14:44,351 --> 01:14:45,119
Role playing

1435
01:14:45,375 --> 01:14:46,143
Scenarios

1436
01:14:46,399 --> 01:14:46,911
Was in there

1437
01:14:48,447 --> 01:14:48,959
Pent

1438
01:14:49,215 --> 01:14:49,727
And a republic

1439
01:14:50,239 --> 01:14:51,007
Came up to Trump

1440
01:14:51,263 --> 01:14:51,775
And they were like

1441
01:14:52,287 --> 01:14:53,311
Give us blind

1442
01:14:53,567 --> 01:14:54,079
Is this

1443
01:14:54,591 --> 01:14:59,455
As if it's the f****** that the people in Judea being like give us Barabbas

1444
01:15:04,831 --> 01:15:08,671
The floor and then rising up out of the Shadows you're just going

1445
01:15:12,255 --> 01:15:14,559
Everything will be fine if you give them Flynn

1446
01:15:15,839 --> 01:15:16,351
No

1447
01:15:16,863 --> 01:15:18,655
Maybe maybe sacrifice to the

1448
01:15:22,751 --> 01:15:23,519
Advisers are

1449
01:15:23,775 --> 01:15:24,287
Are f******

1450
01:15:24,543 --> 01:15:25,055
Stupid

1451
01:15:25,311 --> 01:15:26,079
1

1452
01:15:26,335 --> 01:15:26,847
Baby

1453
01:15:29,151 --> 01:15:31,455
If you have

1454
01:15:31,711 --> 01:15:36,575
If you had a bad day

1455
01:15:38,623 --> 01:15:39,647
Let's

1456
01:15:42,975 --> 01:15:43,487
We talked about

1457
01:15:43,743 --> 01:15:44,255
The MoMA

1458
01:15:44,511 --> 01:15:45,023
It happened

1459
01:15:45,535 --> 01:15:46,815
Or right before that happen

1460
01:15:47,327 --> 01:15:48,351
That was a terrible

1461
01:15:48,607 --> 01:15:49,887
Strategic move

1462
01:15:50,143 --> 01:15:51,935
Not admit of

1463
01:15:52,447 --> 01:15:53,471
Anything other than bad

1464
01:15:54,495 --> 01:15:55,263
That's not like

1465
01:15:58,079 --> 01:16:00,127
Someone who had his ear possibly

1466
01:16:00,383 --> 01:16:01,407
By then

1467
01:16:01,663 --> 01:16:03,199
No f****** biennium

1468
01:16:03,711 --> 01:16:04,223
Anyway

1469
01:16:04,735 --> 01:16:05,503

Gauge with anything real because if he does

1473
01:16:17,279 --> 01:16:19,839
Talk like if he's actually

1474
01:16:20,351 --> 01:16:21,887
Do you have to talk about all that stuff we talked

1475
01:16:22,655 --> 01:16:23,423
The kushners

1476
01:16:23,679 --> 01:16:25,215
Situation situation

1477
01:16:25,471 --> 01:16:27,007
The world shrinking

1478
01:16:27,263 --> 01:16:28,031
Himself

1479
01:16:28,543 --> 01:16:30,335
He has to get to strike

1480
01:16:30,591 --> 01:16:31,359
Anything

1481
01:16:31,871 --> 01:16:32,639
Comes up to fit

1482
01:16:32,895 --> 01:16:33,663
The bulshit narrative

1483
01:16:33,919 --> 01:16:34,431
And yet

1484
01:16:34,943 --> 01:16:38,527
Coming to this with all the anger of the world's ranking in on

1485
01:16:39,039 --> 01:16:40,575
It's really it's really kind of fun

Any good

1493

Advisors

1494
01:16:56,959 --> 01:16:57,471
He wouldn't have

1495
01:16:58,239 --> 01:16:59,007
Phone

1496
01:17:00,287 --> 01:17:06,431
All the time

1497
01:17:06,687 --> 01:17:08,223
According to

1498
01:17:08,479 --> 01:17:09,247

1499
01:17:11,039 --> 01:17:14,367
So this clip is Alex responding to a video

Getting into a little bit of an altercation with with a

1503
01:17:23,327 --> 01:17:25,119
I watch this video about 20 times

But I'll let him say his piece

1506
01:17:32,287 --> 01:17:33,823
Before I describe what is actually going on

1507
01:17:35,103 --> 01:17:35,871
Does Cana

01:17:36,383 --> 01:17:38,431
Shift gears once he's called the

He's talking about the guy they have a little bit of an argument and this

1510
01:17:42,271 --> 01:17:44,575
This very huge British guy

1511
01:17:44,831 --> 01:17:45,343
Kohl's

1512
01:17:46,367 --> 01:17:47,391
The Muslim Guy racist

01:17:47,647 --> 01:17:48,415
Cuz he's like

01:17:52,511 --> 01:17:53,279
Clipper his outfit

1515
01:17:53,535 --> 01:17:55,327
I feel bad even making this up

1516
01:17:57,119 --> 01:17:57,631
Well you know

1517
01:17:57,887 --> 01:17:59,423
We don't have all the information

1518
01:17:59,679 --> 01:18:01,727
But this guy is is like

1519
01:18:03,775 --> 01:18:04,799
Say you look like

1520
01:18:05,055 --> 01:18:05,567
Pork

1521
01:18:05,823 --> 01:18:06,335
To the guy

1522
01:18:10,687 --> 01:18:11,455
And that's what Alex is

1523
01:18:11,967 --> 01:18:12,479
I mean

1524
01:18:14,015 --> 01:18:15,039
Does he look like pork

1525
01:18:15,807 --> 01:18:16,575
Sure he's the other white meat

1526
01:18:17,599 --> 01:18:18,367
Anyway

1527
01:18:20,927 --> 01:18:21,439
Is okay

1528
01:18:21,695 --> 01:18:22,975
Alright

1529
01:18:23,231 --> 01:18:28,351
Set up

1530
01:18:30,399 --> 01:18:33,727
This is the power of this made

1531
01:18:36,799 --> 01:18:37,567
Understand

1532
01:18:38,591 --> 01:18:39,871
The mayor of London

1533
01:18:42,175 --> 01:18:44,479
So he then runs over to the woman

1534
01:18:50,111 --> 01:18:52,671
That's a short clip but it just everything

1535
01:18:53,183 --> 01:18:55,743
This guy anyone United States

1536
01:19:01,887 --> 01:19:04,447
This guy would have been laid out his jaw broken

1537
01:19:04,703 --> 01:19:05,471
Just like that

1538
01:19:07,519 --> 01:19:10,079
What about smashing really fast when you get a woman

1539
01:19:12,127 --> 01:19:15,455
Allow women

1540
01:19:15,711 --> 01:19:16,479
To be attacked

1541
01:19:16,991 --> 01:19:18,527
Because

1542
01:19:18,783 --> 01:19:19,551
The new

1543
01:19:19,807 --> 01:19:25,439
Culture

1544
01:19:26,719 --> 01:19:29,023
Is the be a coward that lays down

1545
01:19:31,839 --> 01:19:33,631
Alex

1546
01:19:33,887 --> 01:19:35,679
Unless you're a mass of other liberals

1547
01:19:35,935 --> 01:19:36,959
Then you attract women

1548
01:19:39,007 --> 01:19:42,079
You will know them because they attack women whether their islamist

1549
01:19:42,335 --> 01:19:45,151
Whether they are

1550
01:19:45,407 --> 01:19:47,455
Weather blacklivesmatter

1551
01:19:47,711 --> 01:19:50,527
They Revel in Cafe

1552
01:19:50,783 --> 01:19:51,551
Cat sanctuary

1553
01:19:53,599 --> 01:19:54,367
Interesting

1554
01:19:54,623 --> 01:19:56,159
The Blue Cat Cafe cats

1555
01:19:56,415 --> 01:20:00,255
I was so thrown off by that that I had to look it up

1556
01:20:02,047 --> 01:20:03,327
Cafe

1557
01:20:04,863 --> 01:20:06,143

Okay go and drink coffee

1559
01:20:10,751 --> 01:20:11,263
Hang out with cats

1560
01:20:11,775 --> 01:20:15,104
And I believe as I understand you're able to adopt

1561
01:20:16,896 --> 01:20:17,408
Society

1562
01:20:17,664 --> 01:20:19,968
Hangout

1563
01:20:20,224 --> 01:20:21,504
OK Google

1564
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:24,064
It's like a it's like a dick spot for cat

1565
01:20:27,648 --> 01:20:28,160
Which is

1566
01:20:28,416 --> 01:20:29,696
Obviously what are you talkin about

1567
01:20:30,976 --> 01:20:33,024
It's breaking news

1568
01:20:33,280 --> 01:20:35,072
This is no other news breaking news

1569
01:20:38,912 --> 01:20:39,680
Was greeted by

1570
01:20:39,936 --> 01:20:42,496
The protesters who were rallying against landlords FF

1571
01:20:42,752 --> 01:20:43,264
Real estate

1572
01:20:44,288 --> 01:20:45,056
The cafe

1573
01:20:45,312 --> 01:20:46,336
Is adjacent to the site of the

1574
01:20:46,848 --> 01:20:47,616

1575
01:20:47,872 --> 01:20:49,152
Pinata store jumper

1576
01:20:49,664 --> 01:20:51,456
Which is also

1577
01:20:51,712 --> 01:20:54,784
It's f****** East Austin

1578
01:20:55,040 --> 01:21:00,160
Something you could really have a pinata store and its controversial that it's being demolished

1579
01:21:01,696 --> 01:21:03,232
Who was the author

1580
01:21:03,488 --> 01:21:05,024

This pinata store Jumpoline was also owned by fnf

1584
01:21:12,960 --> 01:21:14,496
Is now being used

1585
01:21:14,752 --> 01:21:16,032

Diverse business

1606

Supremacist

1607

01:22:12,096 --> 01:22:13,120
Could you possibly have done

1612
01:22:13,376 --> 01:22:14,144
For a pinata

1613
01:22:15,936 --> 01:22:21,824
World stores are on every block

1614
01:22:22,080 --> 01:22:28,224
If a pinata and a latte and I'm good to go

Problem

1621
01:22:42,816 --> 01:22:43,840
Of gentrification in Austin

1622
01:22:44,096 --> 01:22:45,120
And a bunch

Independent businesses

Did they hit a woman

1645
01:23:25,824 --> 01:23:27,104

01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:45,792

Demolition

1654
01:23:46,816 --> 01:23:51,680
Of the business next door and unfortunately unfortunately

1655
01:23:52,192 --> 01:23:52,960
Slightly

1656
01:23:53,472 --> 01:23:53,984
People who wanted to go to

1657
01:23:54,240 --> 01:23:54,752
Cafe

1658
01:23:55,264 --> 01:23:55,776
But it's

1659
01:23:56,032 --> 01:24:00,384
They were chanting outside your cat's if your tea on the ruins of Jumpoline

1660

Yeah

1665
01:24:10,368 --> 01:24:12,160
Arthur and the argument of the protesters

1666
01:24:12,416 --> 01:24:13,184
Chris were

1667
01:24:13,440 --> 01:24:15,488
Animal Welfare work.

1668
01:24:15,744 --> 01:24:16,512
Don't mean it's excused

1669
01:24:16,768 --> 01:24:17,536
From accountability to

1670
01:24:17,792 --> 01:24:19,328
Community that obviously is going

1671
01:24:19,584 --> 01:24:20,096
Through struggle

1672
01:24:20,608 --> 01:24:21,376
Which is

1673
01:24:23,680 --> 01:24:26,752
Now the cat sanctuary their argument was

1674
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:28,800
We wish for the best

1675
01:24:29,056 --> 01:24:30,080
For the business owners

1676
01:24:30,336 --> 01:24:31,360
Nextdoor

1677
01:24:32,384 --> 01:24:33,152
That isn't like

1678
01:24:33,408 --> 01:24:33,920
It's not art

1679
01:24:34,176 --> 01:24:37,248
It's not our job to

1680
01:24:37,760 --> 01:24:38,272
System

1681
01:24:41,856 --> 01:24:42,880
That's the world we live in

1682
01:24:48,256 --> 01:24:49,024
Auntie

1683
01:24:49,280 --> 01:24:51,584
FIFA black black protesters are attacking

1684
01:24:51,840 --> 01:24:54,144
Cuz they hate nice

1685
01:24:54,656 --> 01:24:55,936
They hate these cats

1686
01:24:57,472 --> 01:24:59,264
He says more about it

1687
01:24:59,776 --> 01:25:00,800
But I just wanted you to have a

1688
01:25:04,384 --> 01:25:05,664
And protesting every week

1689
01:25:19,744 --> 01:25:20,256
In the past

1690
01:25:20,512 --> 01:25:21,024
Put super glue

1691
01:25:23,584 --> 01:25:25,376
In Bowling in whatever's weakest

1692
01:25:26,912 --> 01:25:27,936
Dexter spirit

1693
01:25:29,728 --> 01:25:33,568
And so this is what the government of England Thanksgiving

1694
01:26:00,704 --> 01:26:03,776
About

1695
01:26:04,544 --> 01:26:07,104
That's what I was most interested in trades

1696
01:26:07,360 --> 01:26:11,456
But like I said I watch this video

1697
01:26:11,712 --> 01:26:15,808
Exactly what was going on

1698
01:26:16,064 --> 01:26:19,392
Okay so basically if there's two cars

1699
01:26:19,648 --> 01:26:21,696
Muslim guys car is

1700
01:26:24,256 --> 01:26:24,768
The guy has

1701
01:26:25,024 --> 01:26:25,536
Just his car

1702
01:26:25,792 --> 01:26:31,936
So there is probably a minor fender-bender

1703
01:26:32,192 --> 01:26:33,472
Starts with the Muslim gentleman

1704
01:26:33,728 --> 01:26:35,264
Take a picture of the guys license

1705
01:26:35,520 --> 01:26:37,568
Play I'm getting harassed by the wife

1706
01:26:38,336 --> 01:26:40,640
Okay tell her we're off to a good start

1707
01:26:40,896 --> 01:26:42,688
In supporting Alex Jones

1708
01:26:44,736 --> 01:26:47,296
Conclude exactly what the white guy says

1709
01:26:47,808 --> 01:26:48,320
But

1710
01:26:48,576 --> 01:26:49,344
I can assume it's

1711
01:26:50,112 --> 01:26:52,672
I'm sure it's offensive

1712
01:26:52,928 --> 01:26:55,232
It's just hey excuse me sir I would love to

1713
01:26:55,488 --> 01:26:56,256
To pay for the damage

1714
01:26:56,512 --> 01:26:58,048
To your car

1715
01:26:58,304 --> 01:26:58,816
Disseminate

1716
01:26:59,072 --> 01:26:59,584
Seems

1717
01:26:59,840 --> 01:27:00,608
Unrepentant

1718
01:27:00,864 --> 01:27:04,704
About a cat

1719
01:27:05,216 --> 01:27:05,728
Sounds like a

1720
01:27:05,984 --> 01:27:10,336
It starts with the Muslim guy says I'm allowed in this country

1721
01:27:10,592 --> 01:27:13,408
So we can assume that the first thing the white

1722
01:27:13,664 --> 01:27:16,480
Is it something along the lines of

1723
01:27:17,248 --> 01:27:20,576
I bet the original clip

1724
01:27:20,832 --> 01:27:21,344
Was never

1725
01:27:21,600 --> 01:27:22,112
I bet

1726
01:27:22,880 --> 01:27:24,672
There's a longer version on someone's phone

1727
01:27:24,928 --> 01:27:26,208
That isn't online

1728
01:27:27,744 --> 01:27:29,280
Of course

1729
01:27:31,072 --> 01:27:32,608
Because

1730
01:27:32,864 --> 01:27:33,632
Evil Muslim

1731
01:27:33,888 --> 01:27:35,680
Because

1732
01:27:36,192 --> 01:27:37,472
He's got his car hit

1733
01:27:37,984 --> 01:27:39,776
And this guy is being a total

1734
01:27:41,056 --> 01:27:43,104
SD level of eggs

1735
01:27:43,360 --> 01:27:45,408
Essential fear that that guy has

1736
01:27:45,664 --> 01:27:46,176
Nice to have

1737
01:27:46,432 --> 01:27:46,944
Now

1738
01:27:47,200 --> 01:27:48,224
Every single day

1739
01:27:48,736 --> 01:27:49,248
Is

1740
01:27:50,784 --> 01:27:52,064
If I ever lived

1741
01:27:52,320 --> 01:27:52,832
With that

1742
01:27:53,344 --> 01:27:54,112
Level of

1743
01:27:55,136 --> 01:27:56,160
People are

1744
01:27:56,416 --> 01:27:58,208
All day everyday on TV

1745
01:27:58,464 --> 01:27:59,488
Shouting about how I'm

1746
01:28:01,024 --> 01:28:01,536
Personal way

1747
01:28:01,792 --> 01:28:06,144
I would not wish to lose my s***

1748
01:28:06,400 --> 01:28:07,168
Even if that guy was

1749
01:28:07,424 --> 01:28:09,216
Spine

1750
01:28:09,472 --> 01:28:09,984
Terrified

1751
01:28:10,240 --> 01:28:12,288
I'd like you're reacting like a like

1752
01:28:12,544 --> 01:28:18,688
So how you could only find it posted

1753
01:28:18,944 --> 01:28:19,456
On account

1754
01:28:19,712 --> 01:28:20,224
That were like

1755
01:28:20,480 --> 01:28:22,272
See how evil Muslims are

1756
01:28:22,528 --> 01:28:25,344
Nobody had it posted in like a positive light

1757
01:28:25,600 --> 01:28:27,136
But if you actually watch the clip

1758
01:28:28,160 --> 01:28:29,184
The only active

1759
01:28:29,440 --> 01:28:29,952
Violence

1760
01:28:30,208 --> 01:28:30,720
He does

1761
01:28:31,232 --> 01:28:32,000
You look like

1762
01:28:32,256 --> 01:28:38,144
Pork scholarly and that's kind of fun

1763
01:28:39,936 --> 01:28:40,960
How is that racist

1764
01:28:41,472 --> 01:28:44,032
I think I feel like that's more about

1765
01:28:46,080 --> 01:28:49,152
I told you seems like it's more like

1766
01:28:49,408 --> 01:28:51,712
Even if you want to make the argument that it's racist

1767
01:28:53,760 --> 01:28:56,064
That that's like signaling you know like hey

1768
01:28:59,904 --> 01:29:04,256
I'm not offended either because I know that if I were in the situation

1769
01:29:05,280 --> 01:29:05,792
I would approach

1770
01:29:06,048 --> 01:29:12,192
I'm so sorry I hit your car

1771
01:29:17,568 --> 01:29:18,848
Which it clearly is in the video

1772
01:29:20,896 --> 01:29:23,456
He ends up knocking the girls phone camera

1773
01:29:23,968 --> 01:29:24,480
Which is italics

1774
01:29:26,784 --> 01:29:29,344
Knox her camera and because of how

1775
01:29:29,600 --> 01:29:30,368
Videotaping work

1776
01:29:30,624 --> 01:29:33,184
Whenever you hit a phone it looks like someone

1777
01:29:37,024 --> 01:29:38,304
It doesn't she was doing

1778
01:29:38,560 --> 01:29:40,352
Well then

1779
01:29:40,864 --> 01:29:42,400
Immediately not on Hurst

1780
01:29:46,752 --> 01:29:48,032
Little bit of a Down

1781
01:29:49,568 --> 01:29:50,080
He's like

1782
01:29:57,248 --> 01:29:57,760
Deteriorate

1783
01:29:58,016 --> 01:30:00,320
And the lady start saying

1784
01:30:00,576 --> 01:30:06,720
Obviously obviously isn't response to him being like I'm allowed in this country

1785
01:30:06,976 --> 01:30:07,488
Of course

1786
01:30:07,744 --> 01:30:09,536
You're not allowed

1787
01:30:10,560 --> 01:30:11,584
I'm here you're not white

1788
01:30:11,840 --> 01:30:13,888
He is offended by that goes up to her

1789
01:30:14,144 --> 01:30:15,168
I can't tell exactly

1790
01:30:15,424 --> 01:30:16,704
Exactly if you was going to

1791
01:30:16,960 --> 01:30:19,008
Just spit on her or if he's just so worked up

1792
01:30:19,264 --> 01:30:25,152
He ends up like a loogie in a little on himself

1793
01:30:25,920 --> 01:30:27,456
And then he was like

1794
01:30:27,968 --> 01:30:28,480
Get that phone out

1795
01:30:29,248 --> 01:30:31,552
Okay anything wrong

1796
01:30:32,064 --> 01:30:33,344
Yeah I mean

1797
01:30:33,600 --> 01:30:34,880
I used to like them

1798
01:30:35,136 --> 01:30:35,904
Worst thing I can

1799
01:30:37,696 --> 01:30:38,464
I'd like a mile

1800
01:30:38,720 --> 01:30:41,280
Estimation the worst part of that is the whole

1801
01:30:41,792 --> 01:30:43,072
Brost

1802
01:30:43,840 --> 01:30:46,144
Like at any time he did

1803
01:30:46,400 --> 01:30:46,912
Being like

1804
01:30:47,168 --> 01:30:49,472
F*** you guys I've got your license

1805
01:30:49,728 --> 01:30:50,240
Play time just

1806
01:30:50,496 --> 01:30:51,008
Can I get the f*** out

1807
01:30:51,264 --> 01:30:55,616
The only the only thing I can think of

1808
01:30:55,872 --> 01:31:00,480
Dude that's not Muslim toxic masculinity

1809
01:31:00,736 --> 01:31:02,016
That's just dude

1810
01:31:02,528 --> 01:31:03,808
Something that they say is b*******

1811
01:31:05,344 --> 01:31:06,112
No more dude

1812
01:31:06,624 --> 01:31:08,928
Always comes back for Alex

1813
01:31:10,976 --> 01:31:13,024
It is an attack on his masculinity

1814
01:31:13,280 --> 01:31:14,816
It is sexual for him

1815
01:31:15,072 --> 01:31:15,584
In some ways

1816
01:31:17,888 --> 01:31:20,192
I don't understand I agree with you that

1817
01:31:20,448 --> 01:31:22,496
There is a better way to have dealt

1818
01:31:23,008 --> 01:31:29,152
Yeah but I don't want to be mad at all

1819
01:31:29,408 --> 01:31:31,712
In the perfect

1820
01:31:31,968 --> 01:31:32,736
Quiet

1821
01:31:32,992 --> 01:31:34,016
Situation

1822
01:31:35,040 --> 01:31:35,808
Here is the best

1823
01:31:36,320 --> 01:31:37,344
Probable way to do

1824
01:31:40,672 --> 01:31:42,208
And somebody had just come up to me

1825
01:31:42,464 --> 01:31:43,744
And exploited the very

1826
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:46,560
Been told every single day

1827
01:31:46,816 --> 01:31:47,840
On TV is coming for them

1828
01:31:48,096 --> 01:31:50,656
A reasonable and logic

1829
01:31:51,168 --> 01:31:54,496
F****** crazy

1830
01:31:56,544 --> 01:31:58,080
Blaming a religion for that

1831
01:31:59,616 --> 01:32:02,176
F*** you let's go to a couple of quick lies

1832
01:32:03,456 --> 01:32:06,016
This one is about the radio station

1833
01:32:06,528 --> 01:32:10,368
Trump said the fake media

1834
01:32:10,624 --> 01:32:12,672
They are

1835
01:32:13,184 --> 01:32:14,976
R-Truth

1836
01:32:16,256 --> 01:32:21,888
Well they're losing control of the media because of Independent Media because of the internet

1837
01:32:23,424 --> 01:32:29,568
I mean these Theon six big corporations that control 90% of everything you read and wassergass Road

1838
01:32:30,848 --> 01:32:36,992
Capture the internet they need to gain control of the internet is so that's what they're trying to do with this as well

1839
01:32:37,248 --> 01:32:37,760
Done.

1840
01:32:42,368 --> 01:32:48,512
Because I don't mind

1841
01:32:48,768 --> 01:32:50,048
Whatever

1842
01:32:50,816 --> 01:32:54,400
Also don't let those because there are not as many of them anymore

1843
01:32:56,192 --> 01:32:59,776
Episodes as recent as a week or two ago Alex's

1844
01:33:00,032 --> 01:33:00,544
I'm still work with

1845
01:33:01,056 --> 01:33:01,824
Gcn Genesis

1846
01:33:02,080 --> 01:33:03,104
Communication Network

1847
01:33:04,640 --> 01:33:05,408
Clearly lying

1848
01:33:07,200 --> 01:33:08,224
If you want to take some heat off

1849
01:33:08,480 --> 01:33:10,272
That the Genesis communication Network

1850
01:33:10,528 --> 01:33:12,832
He's a gold sale scam

1851
01:33:13,088 --> 01:33:13,600
The his morph

1852
01:33:13,856 --> 01:33:14,624
Into a

1853
01:33:15,136 --> 01:33:17,184
Steel sales exactly

1854
01:33:17,440 --> 01:33:21,024
He wants to take a little bit of distance between the two but if you're paying attention

1855
01:33:21,280 --> 01:33:24,608
We are seeing Network

1856
01:33:24,864 --> 01:33:27,936
Yeah and his bumpers at comeback commercial he said

1857
01:33:32,032 --> 01:33:33,568
He's trying to go both ways

1858
01:33:34,336 --> 01:33:35,616
I like your style

1859
01:33:36,128 --> 01:33:37,664
I like is boldface bullshittery

1860
01:33:44,576 --> 01:33:46,880
Serious but new ones

1861
01:33:47,392 --> 01:33:50,208
We learned boycotted

1862
01:33:50,464 --> 01:33:56,608
Local area and then the globalist even find out

1863
01:34:01,216 --> 01:34:07,360
Termite 170er top was not listening

1864
01:34:21,440 --> 01:34:27,584
Here's another lie

1865
01:34:27,840 --> 01:34:28,864
4000 radio station

1866
01:34:29,120 --> 01:34:30,912
Oh s*** are we

1867
01:34:37,312 --> 01:34:42,432
Literally every second radio station

1868
01:34:43,968 --> 01:34:44,480
Anyway

1869
01:34:44,736 --> 01:34:46,272
T-Mobile store

1870
01:34:46,528 --> 01:34:51,392
David Knight does make a good point about the factory

1871
01:34:59,072 --> 01:35:00,352
Six corporations that own everything

1872
01:35:02,400 --> 01:35:07,520
Let's agree wasn't exactly

1873
01:35:08,800 --> 01:35:10,336
They are getting rid of net neutrality

1874
01:35:10,592 --> 01:35:13,152
Break

1875
01:35:15,712 --> 01:35:18,784
Really ironic

1876
01:35:19,040 --> 01:35:20,064
If all of the things

1877
01:35:21,088 --> 01:35:22,112
All of this blows over

1878
01:35:22,368 --> 01:35:24,160
Trump gets his whole agenda

1879
01:35:24,416 --> 01:35:24,928
Envy

1880
01:35:25,184 --> 01:35:27,488
Cuz of that Alex Jones gets kicked off

1881
01:35:27,744 --> 01:35:33,888
Most ironic thing like

1882
01:35:34,144 --> 01:35:34,912
Ancient Greek style

1883
01:35:35,424 --> 01:35:35,936
Video about that

1884
01:35:38,496 --> 01:35:40,800
You laughing or is Icarus flew too close

1885
01:35:43,104 --> 01:35:44,384
The entire play

1886
01:35:44,640 --> 01:35:45,408
But I

1887
01:35:45,664 --> 01:35:47,200
Like this idea that like

1888
01:35:47,712 --> 01:35:48,992
If you don't list the affiliates

1889
01:35:51,040 --> 01:35:53,088
Kick us out

1890
01:35:53,600 --> 01:35:54,624
When I was younger

1891
01:35:54,880 --> 01:35:55,648
How easy is it

1892
01:35:55,904 --> 01:35:56,672
Define those affiliate

1893
01:35:57,184 --> 01:35:59,744
With your local

1894
01:36:01,280 --> 01:36:03,328
You could just ask around when I was about to

1895
01:36:03,584 --> 01:36:04,608
20 or so

1896
01:36:04,864 --> 01:36:07,168
Maybe a little bit older than that

1897
01:36:07,680 --> 01:36:08,960
Timelines a little vague

1898
01:36:11,008 --> 01:36:11,520
College ugly

1899
01:36:11,776 --> 01:36:12,288
Anyway

1900
01:36:12,544 --> 01:36:15,872
Michael Savage it started saying a bunch of really violently

1901
01:36:16,128 --> 01:36:17,152
Muslim

1902
01:36:17,664 --> 01:36:18,432
Anti-muslim

1903
01:36:19,456 --> 01:36:20,992
My dad is a religious studies

1904
01:36:21,248 --> 01:36:23,552
Professor and is very plugged in with all the

1905
01:36:23,808 --> 01:36:24,320
Community

1906
01:36:24,832 --> 01:36:28,160
And along with the Muslim Community in town

1907
01:36:28,672 --> 01:36:29,952
He was involved

1908
01:36:30,464 --> 01:36:30,976
The campaign

1909
01:36:31,232 --> 01:36:32,256
To get Michael Savage

1910
01:36:32,512 --> 01:36:34,048
Taken off of the local radio

1911
01:36:34,560 --> 01:36:35,840
Okay it was a Grassroots

1912
01:36:36,352 --> 01:36:37,376
Local things that happen

1913
01:36:39,680 --> 01:36:42,752
Weather

1914
01:36:43,264 --> 01:36:43,776
We don't want this

1915
01:36:45,568 --> 01:36:47,616
Make money off of

1916
01:36:47,872 --> 01:36:48,896
Him we will not

1917
01:36:49,152 --> 01:36:50,432
We don't want to be a part of this

1918
01:36:50,688 --> 01:36:52,224
Yeah it's awful

1919
01:36:54,784 --> 01:36:56,320
I got the show taken off the air

1920
01:36:57,600 --> 01:36:59,904
Bright but so his argument that it's the globalist

1921
01:37:00,160 --> 01:37:03,744
Coming in and like targeting little local radio stations

1922
01:37:07,328 --> 01:37:07,840
The globalist

1923
01:37:08,096 --> 01:37:09,120
Because he doesn't listen

1924
01:37:09,632 --> 01:37:11,680
The globalists with their Nayan in

1925
01:37:12,192 --> 01:37:12,704
Resources

1926
01:37:13,472 --> 01:37:13,984
Still can't

1927
01:37:14,496 --> 01:37:15,520
Right

1928
01:37:17,824 --> 01:37:18,592
Alex Jones listen

1929
01:37:19,360 --> 01:37:21,920
And I don't believe for a second I like radio stations

1930
01:37:24,480 --> 01:37:28,576
Are but if yours if you like he was saying that very protest

1931
01:37:29,344 --> 01:37:30,368
You just described

1932
01:37:30,624 --> 01:37:31,136
Is threatened

1933
01:37:31,392 --> 01:37:31,904
Getting the radio

1934
01:37:32,416 --> 01:37:35,488
Yeah that's what he said he would probably

1935
01:37:36,768 --> 01:37:37,536
Forces

1936
01:37:40,096 --> 01:37:42,400
Stop listening then because there are a lot fewer

1937
01:37:42,656 --> 01:37:44,704
Yes absolutely

1938
01:37:44,960 --> 01:37:47,520
It's a community that feels threatened

1939
01:37:48,032 --> 01:37:48,544
Offended

1940
01:37:49,824 --> 01:37:50,592
For no reason

1941
01:37:52,384 --> 01:37:53,152
Will not put up

1942
01:37:53,920 --> 01:37:55,712
They have every right to

1943
01:37:55,968 --> 01:37:56,992
Yeah which is great

1944
01:37:57,248 --> 01:37:59,040
It's a fight for dignity you dumb f***

1945
01:37:59,296 --> 01:38:01,088
It's a knowledge Warfare fight

1946
01:38:08,768 --> 01:38:10,304
So they killed seven million hours

1947
01:38:19,520 --> 01:38:22,080
As a colleague takes place the next few decades

1948
01:38:23,360 --> 01:38:28,736
Rival them properly and show them that you've been subservient

1949
01:38:32,064 --> 01:38:34,112
Some of the chores for the diseases they been

1950
01:38:34,368 --> 01:38:36,160
Dumping out pouring out upon us

1951
01:38:37,440 --> 01:38:37,952
He sounds

1952
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:41,280
Like right now

1953
01:38:41,536 --> 01:38:44,096
He sounds depressed like this whole nightmare scenarios

1954
01:38:44,352 --> 01:38:44,864
Him being like

1955
01:38:48,704 --> 01:38:49,216
A million laughs

1956
01:38:50,240 --> 01:38:50,752
Is there a

1957
01:38:51,520 --> 01:38:52,800
They're going to take out 85

1958
01:38:53,056 --> 01:38:53,568
Percent of my money

1959
01:38:57,408 --> 01:38:58,688
He's being the writing on the wall in this

1960
01:38:58,944 --> 01:39:03,808
And it's in the tone of voice that he's got right here

1961
01:39:04,064 --> 01:39:05,600
Doesn't matter what's really important

1962
01:39:06,112 --> 01:39:07,136
This idea to Ted Turner

1963
01:39:07,648 --> 01:39:08,672
Kill 80%

1964
01:39:08,928 --> 01:39:11,232
What was the first thing you said was Ted

1965
01:39:11,488 --> 01:39:14,560
Turner I didn't hear that part I just started my weekend

1966
01:39:14,816 --> 01:39:15,328
That's a good point

1967
01:39:15,584 --> 01:39:18,144
Turner wants to kill 80% of the population

1968
01:39:18,656 --> 01:39:19,168
What

1969
01:39:20,448 --> 01:39:20,960
Explain

1970
01:39:21,216 --> 01:39:22,752
Just give a reason

1971
01:39:26,080 --> 01:39:27,872
Ted Turner

1972
01:39:29,408 --> 01:39:30,688
The Atlanta Braves

1973
01:39:34,272 --> 01:39:34,784
God

1974
01:39:35,040 --> 01:39:37,856
He didn't interview

1975
01:39:38,112 --> 01:39:41,184
Diu did an interview with Audubon magazine

1976
01:39:42,976 --> 01:39:48,352
Where he says he's an ideal population for the world would be

1977
01:39:48,608 --> 01:39:50,400
About a 95% reduction

1978
01:39:51,680 --> 01:39:52,704
Which is even more it

1979
01:39:52,960 --> 01:39:55,264
Stream Middletown

1980
01:39:56,032 --> 01:39:57,056
If you just

1981
01:39:57,312 --> 01:39:58,592
Snippet it sounds

1982
01:40:01,664 --> 01:40:02,688
Is actually

1983
01:40:03,200 --> 01:40:04,992
How we should have cheese that

1984
01:40:05,248 --> 01:40:06,016
Is over the neck

1985
01:40:07,296 --> 01:40:08,320
Encourage everyone

1986
01:40:09,856 --> 01:40:10,368
Children

1987
01:40:10,624 --> 01:40:11,648
In order to Mass

1988
01:40:11,904 --> 01:40:12,416
Sibley decrees

1989
01:40:12,928 --> 01:40:13,952
Horizon popular

1990
01:40:15,744 --> 01:40:18,048
Which is a terrible idea as we already soft

1991
01:40:18,304 --> 01:40:20,352
Bree is the worst

1992
01:40:21,632 --> 01:40:22,144
What

1993
01:40:22,400 --> 01:40:23,936
It's not about killing tons of

1994
01:40:24,192 --> 01:40:25,728
People it's just about being bored

1995
01:40:25,984 --> 01:40:31,360
Judicious in terms of our future who wants to kill 85%

1996
01:40:31,616 --> 01:40:32,128
The population

1997
01:40:32,384 --> 01:40:34,688
He could have gone with literally any of Bill Burr special

1998
01:40:35,200 --> 01:40:35,712
Now

1999
01:40:36,736 --> 01:40:38,016
Another thing

2000
01:40:39,040 --> 01:40:39,808
Very clearly

2001
01:40:40,064 --> 01:40:40,576
Is

2002
01:40:41,088 --> 01:40:42,368
All of it has to be

2003
01:40:45,440 --> 01:40:46,208
He says

2004
01:40:46,464 --> 01:40:48,768
How old is ideas would have to be implemented

2005
01:40:49,024 --> 01:40:49,792
Voluntarily

2006
01:40:50,304 --> 01:40:51,328
I don't want to force people

2007
01:40:51,584 --> 01:40:52,096
To do these things

2008
01:40:52,608 --> 01:40:53,376
So that

2009
01:40:53,632 --> 01:40:55,424
Alex

2010
01:40:56,960 --> 01:41:03,104
Beyond that still a weird interview to give every weird

2011
01:41:03,360 --> 01:41:05,920
I want to get to that

2012
01:41:06,176 --> 01:41:08,224
Is crazy

2013
01:41:08,480 --> 01:41:11,040
That's right I forgot about

2014
01:41:14,368 --> 01:41:17,184
It's not a nefarious I want to kill the world argument

2015
01:41:17,440 --> 01:41:19,744
As much as it is a crazy person

2016
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:20,512
With a

2017
01:41:21,024 --> 01:41:24,096
Fairly reasonable idea that could never be implemented

2018
01:41:24,352 --> 01:41:25,632
Great

2019
01:41:25,888 --> 01:41:26,400
Terrible

2020
01:41:26,656 --> 01:41:29,728
What are my favorite quotes is he was talking about his wife

2021
01:41:30,240 --> 01:41:31,008
And he was saying like

2022
01:41:32,032 --> 01:41:34,336
I believe the question was about his

2023
01:41:34,592 --> 01:41:35,360
Make a frequent marriages

2024
01:41:37,408 --> 01:41:38,688
You know at the end of the day

2025
01:41:39,712 --> 01:41:40,224
You live

2026
01:41:41,504 --> 01:41:43,296
Like I never did anything with any kids

2027
01:41:46,624 --> 01:41:49,696
Are slightly paraphraser great quote

2028
01:41:54,816 --> 01:41:56,864
You know what. All of us could say we're so lucky

2029
01:41:57,120 --> 01:42:02,496
Lexus. What are you saying is right that you want to insult him by getting married multiple times

2030
01:42:04,800 --> 01:42:10,432
Yeah you know who committed

2031
01:42:10,688 --> 01:42:11,200
Very few

2032
01:42:11,456 --> 01:42:11,968
D'usse

2033
01:42:12,480 --> 01:42:14,016
Well I mean to Ted Turner

2034
01:42:14,272 --> 01:42:15,808
We we are coming up again

2035
01:42:16,320 --> 01:42:19,392
Because I don't get out before too long

2036
01:42:19,904 --> 01:42:20,672
Okay

2037
01:42:20,928 --> 01:42:21,696
Caught a couple clips

2038
01:42:21,952 --> 01:42:22,464
But aren't import

2039
01:42:24,512 --> 01:42:25,792
Get to the next one where I think Alex

2040
01:42:26,048 --> 01:42:26,816
What is

2041
01:42:27,072 --> 01:42:27,584
Talking about

2042
01:42:27,840 --> 01:42:28,352
Himself

2043
01:42:28,864 --> 01:42:29,376
This is

2044
01:42:30,400 --> 01:42:30,912
Another Mass

2045
01:42:31,168 --> 01:42:31,680
Distraction

2046
01:42:32,448 --> 01:42:33,472
From the real issue

2047
01:42:34,240 --> 01:42:35,520
This is stupid

2048
01:42:36,288 --> 01:42:36,800
Very

2049
01:42:37,312 --> 01:42:37,824
Very very

2050
01:42:38,848 --> 01:42:39,360
So stupid

2051
01:42:42,944 --> 01:42:44,480
Manipulatives

2052
01:42:56,768 --> 01:42:59,072
You're coming up

2053
01:43:04,192 --> 01:43:05,216
A TV viewers

2054
01:43:06,496 --> 01:43:07,008
But

2055
01:43:07,264 --> 01:43:13,408
Degenerative male or female

2056
01:43:17,760 --> 01:43:21,344
Augmentation orb

2057
01:43:24,928 --> 01:43:28,000
Face surgeries

2058
01:43:32,864 --> 01:43:38,240
I'm a celebrity

2059
01:43:38,752 --> 01:43:40,288
A carnival show Freak Show

2060
01:43:43,360 --> 01:43:45,152
Not being part of the human system

2061
01:43:45,408 --> 01:43:47,456
Humans look at you and think there's something wrong with you

2062
01:43:47,968 --> 01:43:53,088
Mental illness

2063
01:43:53,344 --> 01:43:59,488
This is another psychic

2064
01:44:03,584 --> 01:44:06,144
To further accelerate the downfall of civilization

2065
01:44:06,656 --> 01:44:11,776
Organize together recognize the disease in the filled the poison breaks the poison Berry

2066
01:44:13,056 --> 01:44:14,592
Others not to eat of them

2067
01:44:14,848 --> 01:44:20,992
And enjoy from the poison fruit in the Garden of Eden we have the knowledge of good it's the

2068
01:44:26,112 --> 01:44:28,416
That's okay so let me try and

2069
01:44:30,208 --> 01:44:30,976
Get through

2070
01:44:31,232 --> 01:44:36,096
Bounce from point-to-point the weather

2071
01:44:36,352 --> 01:44:37,120
So 100

2072
01:44:37,376 --> 01:44:38,144
100 genders

2073
01:44:41,472 --> 01:44:43,776
People are getting body modification

2074
01:44:44,032 --> 01:44:47,872
Things to look like aliens there was a story that came out about a guy

2075
01:44:49,664 --> 01:44:51,456
Got surgery to become a genderless alien

2076
01:44:51,712 --> 01:44:52,224
Yeah

2077
01:44:52,480 --> 01:44:56,064
Uncle that I'm fine with it but it's also texted media does not

2078
01:44:56,320 --> 01:44:58,112
He just read transmission

2079
01:44:59,648 --> 01:45:01,440
Describing but also the media.

2080
01:45:01,696 --> 01:45:02,720
Hold up that case

2081
01:45:02,976 --> 01:45:07,584
How awesome

2082
01:45:07,840 --> 01:45:10,656
Isaac most of the reports about are much like

2083
01:45:10,912 --> 01:45:12,192
Girls you got plans

2084
01:45:14,496 --> 01:45:19,872
Or

2085
01:45:20,128 --> 01:45:21,664
Willingly castrate

2086
01:45:21,920 --> 01:45:26,016
Themselves as well

2087
01:45:27,552 --> 01:45:32,672
Instances of people never even acknowledged the existence of men who would win

2088
01:45:32,928 --> 01:45:33,440
Can we do that

2089
01:45:38,304 --> 01:45:42,912
Understand

2090
01:45:43,168 --> 01:45:43,936
Whatsoever

2091
01:45:44,192 --> 01:45:45,216
It's not that

2092
01:45:46,496 --> 01:45:47,008
Cuz you can't

2093
01:45:47,520 --> 01:45:51,616
Have the knowledge of good without the knowledge of evil in the knowledge of evil without the knowledge

2094
01:45:51,872 --> 01:45:54,432
You don't get one or the other you have to

2095
01:45:54,688 --> 01:45:55,200
To have both

2096
01:45:55,712 --> 01:45:58,528
So once again understand his own theology

2097
01:45:59,296 --> 01:45:59,808
At all

2098
01:46:00,064 --> 01:46:01,088
He also

2099
01:46:01,600 --> 01:46:02,624
In a little bit here

2100
01:46:02,880 --> 01:46:03,392
He's going to

2101
01:46:03,904 --> 01:46:04,672
Really make it

2102
01:46:06,976 --> 01:46:08,768
It's just

2103
01:46:09,024 --> 01:46:09,792
Stupid distraction

2104
01:46:10,048 --> 01:46:11,840
There was someone who got surgery

2105
01:46:12,096 --> 01:46:15,168
To publicize themselves

2106
01:46:21,312 --> 01:46:21,824
Prayers

2107
01:46:22,080 --> 01:46:28,224
What a blizzard out of 7 billion people we got one guy who's like I want to be an alien that's a really good

2108
01:46:29,504 --> 01:46:32,320
The government has to pay for it

2109
01:46:36,416 --> 01:46:39,232
Also I've been I had

2110
01:46:39,488 --> 01:46:40,512
To start looking up tattoo

2111
01:46:40,768 --> 01:46:44,608
Turner quotes

2112
01:46:45,120 --> 01:46:45,888
I'm a very good thinker

2113
01:46:46,144 --> 01:46:47,936
Sometimes grabbed the wrong word

2114
01:46:48,960 --> 01:46:50,752
I say something I didn't think through attic

2115
01:46:51,008 --> 01:46:51,520
Secretly I mean

2116
01:46:53,056 --> 01:46:54,592
Just didn't sit up there and read them off the

2117
01:46:54,848 --> 01:46:55,872
Teleprompter you know

2118
01:46:56,128 --> 01:46:56,640
I Winged It

2119
01:46:57,920 --> 01:46:59,200
Sounds like a drive-in

2120
01:46:59,968 --> 01:47:01,504
Alex Jones would absolutely love

2121
01:47:01,760 --> 01:47:06,624
Really really good

2122
01:47:06,880 --> 01:47:07,648
And I'm not

2123
01:47:09,952 --> 01:47:13,792
Sometimes

2124
01:47:14,560 --> 01:47:16,864
If people get all the sex they can handle their so happy

2125
01:47:19,168 --> 01:47:19,680
I mean

2126
01:47:19,936 --> 01:47:22,496
You never feel aggressive after you've just gotten laid right

2127
01:47:22,752 --> 01:47:25,824
What's the sex forever solution to all the world's problems

2128
01:47:26,080 --> 01:47:30,688
I am in totality

2129
01:47:30,944 --> 01:47:33,248
And somehow inexplicably

2130
01:47:33,760 --> 01:47:34,528
And this is

2131
01:47:34,784 --> 01:47:36,064
This isn't 78

2132
01:47:36,320 --> 01:47:39,136
Okay this is prior to all of these other quotes

2133
01:47:40,160 --> 01:47:40,672
Ted Turner

2134
01:47:41,440 --> 01:47:43,232
Where's the upside in opening your mouth

2135
01:47:47,072 --> 01:47:48,096
Actually 8

2136
01:47:48,608 --> 01:47:49,888
A cautionary Tale

2137
01:47:50,144 --> 01:47:51,168
40 years later

2138
01:47:51,680 --> 01:47:52,192
Ted Turner

2139
01:47:52,448 --> 01:47:55,520
In the guardian virtually Limitless

2140
01:47:57,312 --> 01:48:01,152
That might be because he owns a bunch of fight is Buffalo

2141
01:48:01,408 --> 01:48:03,200
Anyway

2142
01:48:04,480 --> 01:48:04,992
And wrong

2143
01:48:05,248 --> 01:48:07,552
This in this clip Alex speculate

2144
01:48:07,808 --> 01:48:09,600
Basically most crime is

2145
01:48:09,856 --> 01:48:10,368
Isn't real

2146
01:48:11,648 --> 01:48:14,720
Human Liberty

2147
01:48:14,976 --> 01:48:15,488
Also

2148
01:48:15,744 --> 01:48:17,280
I got to stop it because we have another f******

2149
01:48:17,536 --> 01:48:18,304
Song it's awesome

2150
01:48:18,560 --> 01:48:20,608
But he uses which is George Strait

2151
01:48:20,864 --> 01:48:23,680
Amarillo by Morning

2152
01:48:25,472 --> 01:48:28,032
Read about today

2153
01:48:30,336 --> 01:48:32,896
What song is this

2154
01:48:33,920 --> 01:48:36,736
He's remastered why does Hilo

2155
01:48:37,760 --> 01:48:40,832
He's a man of many contradictions

2156
01:48:44,160 --> 01:48:44,672
How could you not

2157
01:48:50,560 --> 01:48:52,864
Attorney General

2158
01:48:55,424 --> 01:49:00,544
Amarillo

2159
01:49:00,800 --> 01:49:02,592
Any symptoms get knocked out

2160
01:49:03,104 --> 01:49:06,432
But

2161
01:49:08,224 --> 01:49:14,368
Infowars.com has a story I haven't seen anybody else report

2162
01:49:14,624 --> 01:49:20,768
Southway to Jewish Community Center

2163
01:49:21,024 --> 01:49:21,536
People

2164
01:49:21,792 --> 01:49:22,560
We've seen an uptick

2165
01:49:24,608 --> 01:49:25,888
It could be coincidence

2166
01:49:26,656 --> 01:49:28,704
Correlation is not causation

2167
01:49:28,960 --> 01:49:29,728
We all know this

2168
01:49:29,984 --> 01:49:30,496
However

2169
01:49:30,752 --> 01:49:32,032
It does seem highly likely

2170
01:49:32,288 --> 01:49:33,312
Set an

2171
01:49:33,568 --> 01:49:34,848
An anti-semitic rhetoric

2172
01:49:35,104 --> 01:49:36,640
In the White House

2173
01:49:36,896 --> 01:49:41,248
Does kind of say that it involves anti-semites all over the place literally the first

2174
01:49:41,504 --> 01:49:42,016
Presidents

2175
01:49:42,272 --> 01:49:43,552
Since World War II

2176
01:49:43,808 --> 01:49:49,696
To not mention the Jews when talking about the Holocaust

2177
01:49:49,952 --> 01:49:54,048
And what

2178
01:49:54,304 --> 01:49:55,072
They feel like

2179
01:49:56,096 --> 01:49:58,656
Now we got one of our own in there

2180
01:49:58,912 --> 01:50:01,216
Also in the same way that Alex Jones

2181
01:50:01,472 --> 01:50:03,520
Feels like now is the time to strike again

2182
01:50:03,776 --> 01:50:06,336
Exactly

2183
01:50:06,592 --> 01:50:11,456
There's never going to be another opportunity we have to go now

2184
01:50:11,712 --> 01:50:13,504
Dear of a false flag

2185
01:50:14,016 --> 01:50:14,784
Jewish person

2186
01:50:15,296 --> 01:50:16,320
Defiling Cemetery

2187
01:50:18,624 --> 01:50:20,160
Silly well unfortunately

2188
01:50:21,952 --> 01:50:23,488
Weather

2189
01:50:23,744 --> 01:50:26,304
Cemetery

2190
01:50:27,584 --> 01:50:28,352
A guy

2191
01:50:28,608 --> 01:50:29,632
Trying to f*** with his ex

2192
01:50:30,400 --> 01:50:31,168
Yeah he wasn't Jewish

2193
01:50:31,680 --> 01:50:37,824
And that is unfortunate because it gives some Credence to the idea that all the other ones are also fake

2194
01:50:38,080 --> 01:50:44,224
Edgar

2195
01:50:44,736 --> 01:50:48,320
Yeah so we already know this dude is

2196
01:50:49,344 --> 01:50:53,184
The reality that we have to deal with

2197
01:50:55,232 --> 01:50:57,280
Dick holes on the left and the right are both

2198
01:50:57,536 --> 01:51:00,864
Assholes once again

2199
01:51:01,120 --> 01:51:02,144
Not left or right

2200
01:51:02,400 --> 01:51:03,680
Dudes

2201
01:51:03,936 --> 01:51:08,544
This guy is doing jilted by his ex

2202
01:51:08,800 --> 01:51:09,824
Kohl's in Toms River

2203
01:51:10,080 --> 01:51:10,592
The Jewish Center

2204
01:51:10,848 --> 01:51:11,360
To f*** with her

2205
01:51:11,616 --> 01:51:14,432
Which eventually

2206
01:51:15,712 --> 01:51:19,296
Very similar to the beginning of game

2207
01:51:19,552 --> 01:51:21,344
So this is

2208
01:51:22,112 --> 01:51:24,160
Awful cycle that we're trapped

2209
01:51:24,672 --> 01:51:25,440
Basically

2210
01:51:25,696 --> 01:51:27,744
Is these really angry dude

2211
01:51:28,768 --> 01:51:29,280
Men

2212
01:51:29,536 --> 01:51:31,584
Right and then you have Alex Jones

2213
01:51:32,096 --> 01:51:32,608
Wale net

2214
01:51:34,400 --> 01:51:35,424
Trying to

2215
01:51:36,704 --> 01:51:37,984
To misrepresent

2216
01:51:39,264 --> 01:51:40,288
The news that's happening

2217
01:51:40,544 --> 01:51:41,056
In order to

2218
01:51:41,312 --> 01:51:42,080
To fit that narrative

2219
01:51:43,360 --> 01:51:45,152
Once he starts doing all of this

2220
01:51:45,408 --> 01:51:45,920
Like

2221
01:51:46,688 --> 01:51:50,784
All these racial crimes are fake I've never seen white racism

2222
01:51:51,040 --> 01:51:52,320
Also

2223
01:51:52,576 --> 01:51:55,136
But not Caesar totally not racist

2224
01:51:55,392 --> 01:51:56,928
They're happy with me

2225
01:51:58,976 --> 01:51:59,744
Pitching White

2226
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:01,280
Genocide type narrative

2227
01:52:02,304 --> 01:52:05,376
Tyler Snodgrass was filling in for you he asked

2228
01:52:05,888 --> 01:52:06,400
Alex

2229
01:52:06,656 --> 01:52:07,168
Supremacist

2230
01:52:07,936 --> 01:52:09,728
And at the time I answer was

2231
01:52:10,240 --> 01:52:11,008
I don't have enough information

2232
01:52:11,264 --> 01:52:17,152
Information I'm not sure and at this time as

2233
01:52:18,688 --> 01:52:20,224
I don't think it's a deaf

2234
01:52:21,248 --> 01:52:22,272
But man I'm watching

2235
01:52:22,784 --> 01:52:24,064
I mean

2236
01:52:24,320 --> 01:52:25,856
A r star Charter

2237
01:52:26,112 --> 01:52:30,464
Very difficult

2238
01:52:31,488 --> 01:52:32,512
You going to stay things that

2239
01:52:32,768 --> 01:52:34,048
Suggest he's not a white supremacist

2240
01:52:38,400 --> 01:52:40,192
As opposed to every

2241
01:52:40,448 --> 01:52:42,752
I don't know I'm just

2242
01:52:45,056 --> 01:52:45,568
Ivan

2243
01:52:47,104 --> 01:52:49,408
System like 3%

2244
01:52:50,176 --> 01:52:50,944
Always

2245
01:52:51,200 --> 01:52:51,968
White supremacist

2246
01:52:52,992 --> 01:52:53,504
Does

2247
01:52:55,808 --> 01:52:58,368
So whether or not you said you know it doesn't matter

2248
01:52:58,880 --> 01:53:01,696
It doesn't matter if you say like

2249
01:53:03,744 --> 01:53:06,304
Or even if you're cool with your black friend

2250
01:53:10,144 --> 01:53:11,936
Expression goat

2251
01:53:15,008 --> 01:53:15,776
Two more after

2252
01:53:18,080 --> 01:53:18,592
I'm just

2253
01:53:20,128 --> 01:53:21,664
Let's pull back the curtain you have a show tonight

2254
01:53:21,920 --> 01:53:24,736
I don't want to ruin that for you but

2255
01:53:36,512 --> 01:53:37,024
I'll also

2256
01:53:37,280 --> 01:53:40,352
You tried to make the argument that this

2257
01:53:40,608 --> 01:53:41,120
About

2258
01:53:43,168 --> 01:53:44,704
The guy who called in

2259
01:53:49,824 --> 01:53:50,336
Everyone

2260
01:53:55,456 --> 01:53:56,992
Obama anti

2261
01:53:58,272 --> 01:53:58,784
Trump

2262
01:53:59,040 --> 01:53:59,552
Opera

2263
01:54:00,320 --> 01:54:01,856
Hanna Reservoir Jewish Center

2264
01:54:02,624 --> 01:54:04,928
Bomb threat has an anti Trump Muslim convert

2265
01:54:06,208 --> 01:54:12,352
Oh my God

2266
01:54:20,800 --> 01:54:21,568
Attack

2267
01:54:22,080 --> 01:54:24,128
We see out there are false flag

2268
01:54:48,960 --> 01:54:52,544
What court case latest Austin where

2269
01:54:56,896 --> 01:54:57,408
Portland

2270
01:55:01,248 --> 01:55:03,296
Social justice Warriors

2271
01:55:04,320 --> 01:55:05,344
This makes me so sad

2272
01:55:06,112 --> 01:55:07,648
Chocolate made me so f******

2273
01:55:08,160 --> 01:55:09,696
God names

2274
01:55:09,952 --> 01:55:12,512
Is he talking

2275
01:55:12,768 --> 01:55:13,792
Are false flag

2276
01:55:15,072 --> 01:55:15,840
Everyone just wants it

2277
01:55:16,096 --> 01:55:18,400
Attention

2278
01:55:21,472 --> 01:55:21,984
All sexes

2279
01:55:22,496 --> 01:55:24,288
All sex isn't rape

2280
01:55:24,544 --> 01:55:26,592
There's no way there's a lot of rain

2281
01:55:27,104 --> 01:55:29,408
There is

2282
01:55:29,920 --> 01:55:30,688
A lot of it

2283
01:55:35,552 --> 01:55:36,832
Culture he doesn't believe in

2284
01:55:37,088 --> 01:55:39,648
The idea that they're unlocked

2285
01:55:40,160 --> 01:55:44,256
Believe that there's unreported sexual assault on campus

2286
01:55:45,280 --> 01:55:49,120
Pentagon

2287
01:55:51,424 --> 01:55:54,752
Did the entire the entire theme of this episode is

2288
01:55:55,264 --> 01:55:55,776
Alex Jones

2289
01:55:56,032 --> 01:55:59,360
Blaming everyone but who's really at fault which is

2290
01:55:59,616 --> 01:56:00,896
Dude that's not this episode

2291
01:56:05,248 --> 01:56:07,040
Examples

2292
01:56:07,552 --> 01:56:11,136
You was talking about maybe this entire show is

2293
01:56:11,392 --> 01:56:14,208
At like all of this is a distraction from

2294
01:56:14,464 --> 01:56:14,976
Toxic Mass

2295
01:56:15,744 --> 01:56:21,888
I'm becoming more and more convinced every single islamism

2296
01:56:22,400 --> 01:56:22,912
Dude

2297
01:56:26,752 --> 01:56:28,032
The whole thing

2298
01:56:28,544 --> 01:56:31,360
Is Eddie possible distraction from the fact that

2299
01:56:31,616 --> 01:56:33,152
A lot of dudes

2300
01:56:34,944 --> 01:56:35,456
Bad s***

2301
01:56:35,968 --> 01:56:38,528
Anyway he brings up like

2302
01:56:38,784 --> 01:56:39,552
The Duke lacrosse

2303
01:56:40,064 --> 01:56:41,600
Thing in there that's what he was reference

2304
01:56:41,856 --> 01:56:46,464
Mike 444 White

2305
01:56:47,232 --> 01:56:48,768
Yeah sure that was that was bad

2306
01:56:49,280 --> 01:56:50,304
That was bad

2307
01:56:51,328 --> 01:56:53,120
Cool so are all the rich

2308
01:56:53,632 --> 01:56:59,776
Just because one on the board of falsely accused of rape

2309
01:57:00,288 --> 01:57:01,568
And then we've got

2310
01:57:03,616 --> 01:57:06,944
20 million on the board of accused of rape

2311
01:57:07,968 --> 01:57:09,504
Facing any consequences

2312
01:57:09,760 --> 01:57:11,552
The best actor and our present

2313
01:57:13,856 --> 01:57:14,624
Silicate

2314
01:57:14,880 --> 01:57:17,184
Just because we're

2315
01:57:19,744 --> 01:57:21,024
It's almost impossible for us

2316
01:57:23,840 --> 01:57:25,632
I can't I can't say enough how much

2317
01:57:26,912 --> 01:57:27,424
Really

2318
01:57:31,776 --> 01:57:33,568
Anyway I have to I have to

2319
01:57:34,080 --> 01:57:34,592
My spot

2320
01:57:34,848 --> 01:57:40,992
Because we you know we got it we got to get in what needs to be got in and this next

2321
01:57:41,248 --> 01:57:42,272
Play

2322
01:57:42,784 --> 01:57:43,808
So fun

2323
01:57:44,064 --> 01:57:45,088
This one's fun

2324
01:57:48,160 --> 01:57:48,928
This one

2325
01:57:49,184 --> 01:57:50,208
Is a lie about him meeting

2326
01:57:50,464 --> 01:57:51,232
A military

2327
01:57:55,328 --> 01:57:58,144
You're going to find out

2328
01:57:58,656 --> 01:57:59,168
Super weird

2329
01:57:59,680 --> 01:58:00,192
About

2330
01:58:00,704 --> 01:58:01,216
Again

2331
01:58:01,984 --> 01:58:03,520
Kind of masculine issue dudes

2332
01:58:05,056 --> 01:58:08,640
We're on over 200 radio station so we don't let cuss words go out

2333
01:58:09,152 --> 01:58:10,688
Cassandra MCC regulations

2334
01:58:14,016 --> 01:58:15,552
He's not president anymore

2335
01:58:17,088 --> 01:58:19,136
And so we enter into the next problem

2336
01:58:19,392 --> 01:58:20,160
We know

2337
01:58:20,928 --> 01:58:27,072
I apologize I pulled out the wrong Cliff Obama and Hillary

2338
01:58:27,328 --> 01:58:33,216
It's like they've got nothing to do with nothing

2339
01:58:34,240 --> 01:58:35,264
It's still going yeah

2340
01:58:35,520 --> 01:58:36,288
Anyway here's the right click

2341
01:58:37,312 --> 01:58:43,456
Psychologist

2342
01:58:43,712 --> 01:58:49,856
Schneider jobs

2343
01:58:50,112 --> 01:58:51,136
The big four Banks

2344
01:58:57,536 --> 01:58:59,072
American Airlines mobile app

2345
01:58:59,584 --> 01:59:00,864
Famous conversation

2346
01:59:03,936 --> 01:59:06,240
Steal my catchphrase

2347
01:59:16,480 --> 01:59:16,992
You didn't

2348
01:59:18,784 --> 01:59:21,600
I famously came up with that

2349
01:59:25,184 --> 01:59:26,464
You think people will

2350
01:59:26,720 --> 01:59:29,792
To fight the system

2351
01:59:30,048 --> 01:59:33,120
Admit they're going to

2352
01:59:33,376 --> 01:59:35,424
Given whatever we do as long as it's incremental

2353
01:59:35,680 --> 01:59:39,264
It was in the shower you with your business dad was retired General

2354
01:59:39,776 --> 01:59:40,544
And

2355
02:00:01,280 --> 02:00:01,792
But

2356
02:00:15,872 --> 02:00:20,224
You have to adapt

2357
02:00:20,480 --> 02:00:25,856
And the man that works troid with the ones that got to where they liked it and the ones that are destroyed

2358
02:00:26,880 --> 02:00:29,440
That's what they do with the public

2359
02:00:30,208 --> 02:00:34,048
And then get us to adapt

2360
02:00:34,560 --> 02:00:37,632
The highest knowledge

2361
02:00:38,400 --> 02:00:41,216
We are not submitted

2362
02:00:41,472 --> 02:00:45,056
We're trying to adapt to actually overcome it for people and build a better system

2363
02:00:54,528 --> 02:00:56,064
Well neither do I

2364
02:00:59,392 --> 02:01:00,160
Trying to

2365
02:01:00,416 --> 02:01:01,696
I do I kind of thing

2366
02:01:01,952 --> 02:01:05,536
Think he has a good point but it's only applicable to how

2367
02:01:06,304 --> 02:01:08,096
The GOP is managed to convince

2368
02:01:08,352 --> 02:01:10,400
People to vote against their own interests by

2369
02:01:10,656 --> 02:01:11,424
Aiden

2370
02:01:11,936 --> 02:01:13,216
Extrapolate

2371
02:01:13,472 --> 02:01:15,776
Amphitheatre

2372
02:01:21,152 --> 02:01:25,248
Would you be impressed by a guy who is wearing his clothes

2373
02:01:25,760 --> 02:01:31,136
Looks great he got up and everything

2374
02:01:31,904 --> 02:01:34,976
Turn our on a plane

2375
02:01:35,488 --> 02:01:36,000
Talk to Alex

2376
02:01:36,512 --> 02:01:37,024
Is gets up

2377
02:01:38,304 --> 02:01:40,096
You got a gray suit you got a great too

2378
02:01:40,352 --> 02:01:41,376
What I am more into

2379
02:01:43,680 --> 02:01:44,192
There's two things that

2380
02:01:45,728 --> 02:01:46,496
What is

2381
02:01:48,544 --> 02:01:50,336
He's glorifying the idea of being

2382
02:01:50,592 --> 02:01:51,360
Cool with killing

2383
02:01:52,384 --> 02:01:53,920
Military like

2384
02:01:54,176 --> 02:01:54,944
To kill people

2385
02:01:55,456 --> 02:01:55,968
And

2386
02:01:58,272 --> 02:01:58,784
Start to like

2387
02:01:59,040 --> 02:01:59,808
Like to kill people

2388
02:02:00,576 --> 02:02:02,624
Even for a military

2389
02:02:04,160 --> 02:02:05,696
I like the idea of killing

2390
02:02:05,952 --> 02:02:07,232
Having to be done

2391
02:02:07,744 --> 02:02:08,512
Sometimes

2392
02:02:09,024 --> 02:02:10,048
Judiciously

2393
02:02:10,304 --> 02:02:10,816
5 ml

2394
02:02:11,584 --> 02:02:13,376
I do not like the idea that like

2395
02:02:13,888 --> 02:02:14,400
We love calendar

2396
02:02:15,168 --> 02:02:17,216
That's f***** up I don't like anybody

2397
02:02:17,472 --> 02:02:17,984
Who says that

2398
02:02:18,752 --> 02:02:19,264
.

2399
02:02:20,544 --> 02:02:21,056
Cuz it while

2400
02:02:21,568 --> 02:02:22,592
The second thing is

2401
02:02:23,104 --> 02:02:24,896
He talks about this military psychologist

2402
02:02:25,152 --> 02:02:26,432
Off the Record

2403
02:02:27,200 --> 02:02:27,968
I think means

2404
02:02:32,576 --> 02:02:37,184
And I had that I told

2405
02:02:44,096 --> 02:02:44,864
Pics of a conversation

2406
02:02:45,120 --> 02:02:46,144
If it was off the Record

2407
02:02:47,680 --> 02:02:49,216
That's not the important part

2408
02:02:53,056 --> 02:02:54,080
He's so cute

2409
02:02:54,336 --> 02:02:58,944
He's so arrogant only chicken necks

2410
02:02:59,200 --> 02:03:00,480
He's not a he's a dude

2411
02:03:00,992 --> 02:03:02,016
Alex's

2412
02:03:02,528 --> 02:03:04,320
F****** problem with people being arrogant

2413
02:03:04,576 --> 02:03:05,088
And quotes

2414
02:03:05,600 --> 02:03:06,368
Things are better than me

2415
02:03:10,208 --> 02:03:10,720
He's projecting

2416
02:03:11,232 --> 02:03:11,744
So much

2417
02:03:12,000 --> 02:03:13,280
Yeah but like all these people think they're

2418
02:03:13,536 --> 02:03:14,560
Smart better than me

2419
02:03:14,816 --> 02:03:20,448
Look that's in your head a****** I'm starting to be more and more convinced by this

2420
02:03:20,960 --> 02:03:21,472
If

2421
02:03:21,728 --> 02:03:23,520
The people in like if the New York

2422
02:03:23,776 --> 02:03:24,800
X would just be like

2423
02:03:25,312 --> 02:03:26,080
Alex Jones

2424
02:03:26,336 --> 02:03:28,128
We think you're so smart

2425
02:03:30,944 --> 02:03:32,224
Push him in the right direction

2426
02:03:32,480 --> 02:03:35,040
Like what like with Trump there is a part of me that believes

2427
02:03:35,296 --> 02:03:36,320
If we give Trump

2428
02:03:37,088 --> 02:03:37,600
Positive

2429
02:03:37,856 --> 02:03:39,136
Feedback and candy

2430
02:03:41,440 --> 02:03:47,584
20 sounded presidential or whatever

2431
02:03:47,840 --> 02:03:48,352
You give him positive

2432
02:03:48,608 --> 02:03:49,120
Feedback

2433
02:03:49,632 --> 02:03:50,912
Maybe he'll start

2434
02:03:51,936 --> 02:03:54,752
Like we could push him in the like a cuz he just wants to

2435
02:03:55,008 --> 02:03:58,592
I want people to like it may be president

2436
02:03:58,848 --> 02:04:04,992
I don't want baby propaganda

2437
02:04:06,016 --> 02:04:08,576
It's not workout

2438
02:04:08,832 --> 02:04:12,416
Children their small babies

2439
02:04:12,672 --> 02:04:18,816
Possible that by the time this episode is aired we will have a new president no but the situation on the ground will be

2440
02:04:19,328 --> 02:04:20,608
It is just on Saturday

2441
02:04:20,864 --> 02:04:27,008
We haven't we haven't tomorrow could be a wild day during the recording of this episode

2442
02:04:27,264 --> 02:04:28,800
Neither of us have checked Twitter

2443
02:04:29,056 --> 02:04:32,640
It might be an entirely new situation by the end of the recording

2444
02:04:33,152 --> 02:04:33,664
Very possible

2445
02:04:38,272 --> 02:04:39,040
And this one

2446
02:04:39,296 --> 02:04:40,064
About

2447
02:04:40,320 --> 02:04:41,088
10 minutes

2448
02:04:42,880 --> 02:04:43,648
We can break it up

2449
02:04:43,904 --> 02:04:46,208
But the reason that is important is that Alex

2450
02:04:46,464 --> 02:04:46,976
Loses

2451
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:48,512
About money

2452
02:04:49,024 --> 02:04:50,560
While talking about not caring about my

2453
02:04:52,352 --> 02:04:53,632
Accidentally being

2454
02:04:53,888 --> 02:04:55,168
Unreleased

2455
02:04:55,680 --> 02:04:59,776
He talks earlier earlier in the show this is a Christian

2456
02:05:00,032 --> 02:05:02,336
Program we don't cuss on it right

2457
02:05:03,104 --> 02:05:04,128
What

2458
02:05:04,896 --> 02:05:05,664
In this next

2459
02:05:06,944 --> 02:05:07,456
Literally

2460
02:05:07,712 --> 02:05:08,992
I think everybody

2461
02:05:09,248 --> 02:05:10,016
Who goes to church

2462
02:05:12,064 --> 02:05:13,856
And horrified by what he says

2463
02:05:15,136 --> 02:05:18,976
We'll talk more if you're really giving people go to church a lot of credits

2464
02:05:19,232 --> 02:05:21,536
In my life

2465
02:05:21,792 --> 02:05:22,304
Route

2466
02:05:22,560 --> 02:05:23,584
I feel like

2467
02:05:23,840 --> 02:05:25,120
The people that I knew

2468
02:05:25,632 --> 02:05:26,144
Executor of this sort

2469
02:05:26,656 --> 02:05:30,496
In my heart of hearts

2470
02:05:30,752 --> 02:05:33,056
No depths of depravity that people who go to

2471
02:05:34,848 --> 02:05:35,360
What's the longest

2472
02:05:35,872 --> 02:05:36,384
And you just

2473
02:05:36,640 --> 02:05:37,920
Use the term heart of hearts

2474
02:05:38,176 --> 02:05:42,016
Church credibility I know the language

2475
02:05:42,528 --> 02:05:43,552
There's a nice sales pitch

2476
02:05:43,808 --> 02:05:44,576
That goes bad

2477
02:05:49,952 --> 02:05:54,048
And always have

2478
02:05:54,304 --> 02:06:00,448
Bring in Georgia

2479
02:06:00,704 --> 02:06:02,496
Covers this like it's a good thing and

2480
02:06:02,752 --> 02:06:03,520
So I mean

2481
02:06:03,776 --> 02:06:07,104
We do have a fight on her hands focuses

2482
02:06:07,360 --> 02:06:09,408
Are you see how far we've come

2483
02:06:19,136 --> 02:06:20,160
So you skipping a break

2484
02:06:23,232 --> 02:06:25,024
Is very

2485
02:06:27,072 --> 02:06:28,352
Which would be a commercial

2486
02:06:32,192 --> 02:06:34,496
It's a 9 minute commercial

2487
02:06:34,752 --> 02:06:38,336
No you can't possibly

2488
02:06:38,592 --> 02:06:42,176
We have over 40 million people to listen

2489
02:06:42,688 --> 02:06:45,248
And that watches on YouTube and Facebook on a platform

2490
02:06:45,504 --> 02:06:47,808
4344 million people

2491
02:06:50,112 --> 02:06:56,256
I think I'm doing good jobs that I'm selling a thousand t-shirts a day

2492
02:06:59,328 --> 02:07:01,376
$5 or $4 Jamaican t-shirt

2493
02:07:01,888 --> 02:07:03,936
I care about those shirts in the streets

2494
02:07:04,448 --> 02:07:08,288
I got to find myself so I'll try to make $5 on them we have the new Trump

2496
02:07:09,824 --> 02:07:10,848
Will it save the world

2497
02:07:13,664 --> 02:07:17,248
People instead of 100,000 people

2498
02:07:17,504 --> 02:07:21,344
A million people

2499
02:07:22,112 --> 02:07:23,904
On the street with Trump is my president

2500
02:07:26,720 --> 02:07:28,000

Worship

2505
02:08:07,680 --> 02:08:09,216
That's literal sacrilege

2506
02:08:12,032 --> 02:08:13,312
$20 shirts

2507
02:08:13,824 --> 02:08:18,688

2509
02:08:20,736 --> 02:08:21,504
There is a

2510
02:08:25,088 --> 02:08:25,600
Location for it

2511
02:08:26,880 --> 02:08:28,672
The mega churches

2512
02:08:29,696 --> 02:08:35,840
The whole thing that everything that he's talking about if your author of the Giants

2513
02:08:36,608 --> 02:08:37,888
That is sacrilege

2514
02:08:38,144 --> 02:08:38,656
Sure

2515
02:08:42,496 --> 02:08:43,520
The Jesus Christ Our Lord

2516
02:08:47,616 --> 02:08:52,736
The most brilliant lie I've ever been I've ever been part of

2517
02:08:52,992 --> 02:08:54,784
Pastor Creflo a dollar

2518
02:08:55,040 --> 02:08:57,856
YouTube

2519
02:08:58,880 --> 02:09:01,184
Now your point though is that the word

2520
02:09:01,440 --> 02:09:02,720
Hive to him

2521
02:09:03,232 --> 02:09:04,768
Is the big one

2522
02:09:05,280 --> 02:09:06,048
That's a big one

2523
02:09:06,304 --> 02:09:07,584
Text f*****-up

Create good work

2527
02:09:19,360 --> 02:09:24,224
Against

2528
02:09:24,480 --> 02:09:25,248
The church is the people

2529
02:09:25,504 --> 02:09:26,016
Ulta Comenity

2530
02:09:26,272 --> 02:09:28,064
If Infowars is doing the good work

2531
02:09:28,320 --> 02:09:29,856
Well then Infowars is your

2532
02:09:30,112 --> 02:09:31,392
My friend Infowars is the

2533
02:09:31,648 --> 02:09:33,696
The community and all of these churches are just

2534
02:09:40,608 --> 02:09:41,120
In that

2535
02:09:41,376 --> 02:09:44,192
Like late 90s commercial where the guys getting it

2536
02:09:44,448 --> 02:09:46,752
Text Branson all that too

2537
02:09:53,152 --> 02:09:53,664
First of all

2538
02:09:54,176 --> 02:09:55,456
We have Alex morphine

2539
02:09:55,712 --> 02:09:56,736
M2 facelift

2540
02:09:56,992 --> 02:09:58,016
Alarm for political

2541
02:10:00,320 --> 02:10:00,832
Smurfing in

2542
02:10:01,088 --> 02:10:02,624
Game 2 is he going to try and get

2543
02:10:02,880 --> 02:10:03,648
Tax exempt status

2544
02:10:03,904 --> 02:10:05,952
But he's he's turning this into a church

2545
02:10:06,464 --> 02:10:07,744
In front of her eyes

2546
02:10:12,352 --> 02:10:13,888
Maybe that's how he does it

2547
02:10:14,400 --> 02:10:16,448
L.ron Hubbard

2548
02:10:18,752 --> 02:10:23,104
Well Alex Jones can't do it

2549
02:10:23,360 --> 02:10:25,920
But as we discussed IDI back on the page

2550
02:10:26,176 --> 02:10:26,944
Just taking atheras

2551
02:10:32,320 --> 02:10:33,856
Transparent and lame and

2552
02:10:34,112 --> 02:10:35,136
He's trying so hard

2553
02:10:35,392 --> 02:10:35,904
To make it not

2554
02:10:38,720 --> 02:10:39,744
Sl1000

2555
02:10:40,512 --> 02:10:42,048
A million

2556
02:10:42,304 --> 02:10:43,072
Streets

2557
02:10:45,376 --> 02:10:45,888
List money that year

2558
02:10:46,656 --> 02:10:47,680
I want you

2559
02:10:48,960 --> 02:10:49,728
Where are these

2560
02:10:50,240 --> 02:10:51,008
And make a movement

2561
02:10:51,264 --> 02:10:52,032
Now admitted

2562
02:10:52,544 --> 02:10:53,312
That means you're going

2563
02:10:53,568 --> 02:10:54,080
Going to give me a lot

2564
02:10:54,848 --> 02:10:56,128
Yeah

2565
02:10:56,384 --> 02:10:58,944
He's waffling between those two ideas

2566
02:10:59,200 --> 02:10:59,712
For this

2567
02:10:59,968 --> 02:11:03,040
Entire clip where

2568
02:11:03,296 --> 02:11:05,600
Mcbreen it was in there tries to talk about

2569
02:11:05,856 --> 02:11:08,928
To make adjustments

2570
02:11:10,208 --> 02:11:11,744
That's let's play this at

2571
02:11:12,000 --> 02:11:13,792
Apply to promote Justice

2572
02:11:15,840 --> 02:11:16,864
Somebody

2573
02:11:18,400 --> 02:11:20,704
Just read the links for the Articles reach out to people

2574
02:11:21,216 --> 02:11:23,776
Class I would buy just one shirt

2575
02:11:24,032 --> 02:11:25,568
100

2576
02:11:25,824 --> 02:11:31,968
In different sizes give them to people

2577
02:11:32,480 --> 02:11:34,016
That's basically multi-level marketing

2578
02:11:38,368 --> 02:11:41,440
I love you Alex Jones by a bunch of shirts and selling to people

2579
02:11:41,696 --> 02:11:46,560
F****** lunatic

2580
02:11:46,816 --> 02:11:49,376
Gospel

2581
02:11:50,656 --> 02:11:51,168
Shirts

2582
02:11:54,496 --> 02:11:56,288
Just get the shirts

2583
02:11:56,544 --> 02:12:00,896
I honestly think of that it might be an indication that he has too many

2584
02:12:02,688 --> 02:12:06,528
We got a movie search

2585
02:12:06,784 --> 02:12:08,064
Everything

2586
02:12:08,320 --> 02:12:14,464
Percent off that's fair I know we're going out of business he's also started a new thing where if you sign up for their newsletter they

2587
02:12:14,720 --> 02:12:16,256
Loft coupons

2588
02:12:16,512 --> 02:12:17,024
For a new thing

2589
02:12:21,632 --> 02:12:24,192
Now we're going back on the angel

2590
02:12:24,960 --> 02:12:26,496
Everything he's doing

2591
02:12:26,752 --> 02:12:27,776
Kind of make it sound like he's broke

2592
02:12:28,544 --> 02:12:29,568
No

2593
02:12:30,336 --> 02:12:34,176
I'm still waffling myself in the middle of like trying to parse

2594
02:12:34,432 --> 02:12:37,248
Exactly what is going on

2595
02:12:37,504 --> 02:12:38,016
Brokenness

2596
02:12:40,320 --> 02:12:41,344
But I don't

2597
02:12:41,600 --> 02:12:42,112
I don't think

2598
02:12:42,624 --> 02:12:43,136
Second chance

2599
02:12:43,392 --> 02:12:44,416
He's going to

2600
02:12:44,672 --> 02:12:45,184
Like

2601
02:12:46,208 --> 02:12:47,232
Screwed

2602
02:12:56,448 --> 02:13:02,592
Inferno

2603
02:13:02,848 --> 02:13:03,360
Call Tina

2604
02:13:03,616 --> 02:13:06,688
Alex when we went to the pro pro Trump rallies

2605
02:13:06,944 --> 02:13:08,224
All across the country

2606
02:13:09,248 --> 02:13:15,392
Full of Infowars

2607
02:13:18,976 --> 02:13:23,328
It shows the MSN the real power it shows the Trump people

2608
02:13:23,840 --> 02:13:25,888
Also exercises free speech

2609
02:13:26,144 --> 02:13:27,936
In the face of the bullies

2610
02:13:28,192 --> 02:13:34,336
But also people that are scared

2611
02:13:44,576 --> 02:13:48,928
I told you I had a conversation with my older brother who's a traditional Republican

2612
02:13:49,440 --> 02:13:51,488
Establishment Republican

2613
02:13:51,744 --> 02:13:55,584
Sinusitis

2614
02:13:55,840 --> 02:13:59,424
Hundreds of millions and billions of taxpayer money

2615
02:13:59,680 --> 02:14:04,800
The fights on now in every

2616
02:14:05,056 --> 02:14:11,200

Oh my God

2619
02:14:21,184 --> 02:14:23,744
Tell a lot about somebody by how they treat

2620
02:14:24,000 --> 02:14:25,792
People they work with and how they like

2621
02:14:26,048 --> 02:14:28,096
They start interacting he's comfortable moments

2622
02:14:28,352 --> 02:14:30,144
Is Alex

2623
02:14:30,400 --> 02:14:31,168

02:14:32,192 --> 02:14:33,216
About something when he wants

2626
02:14:33,472 --> 02:14:33,984
To go

2627
02:14:34,240 --> 02:14:36,032
What do you wants to get on the roll it's

2628
02:14:36,288 --> 02:14:38,848
Got to go

02:14:40,128 --> 02:14:41,664
But now that's a dick move

2630
02:14:41,920 --> 02:14:43,456
I'm like a

02:14:43,968 --> 02:14:45,504
Child like a little boy

2632
02:14:45,760 --> 02:14:46,528
Like he's at the

2633
02:14:46,784 --> 02:14:49,088
The Kids Table Thanksgiving

2634
02:14:49,344 --> 02:14:50,368

And then get right back

2637
02:14:55,232 --> 02:14:59,584
I bet he tells him to stop.

2638
02:15:07,264 --> 02:15:09,056
Everyone

2639
02:15:12,896 --> 02:15:13,408

02:15:16,480 --> 02:15:19,808
Well proud when we went to the

2642
02:15:20,064 --> 02:15:25,184
Pro Trump rallies that every fifth person had an Infowars shirt on and then it seemed like every

2643
02:15:29,280 --> 02:15:35,168
And we were like rock stars man they would recognize everybody from Infowars

2644
02:15:35,424 --> 02:15:38,240
Listeners

2645
02:15:38,496 --> 02:15:44,640

My brother about that and this was before the election by the way and he says well little brother I don't really see how that's hell

2647
02:15:53,856 --> 02:16:00,000

Worked out

2649
02:16:14,592 --> 02:16:19,712
I'm telling you I had no idea

2650
02:16:25,344 --> 02:16:26,624
Trump
