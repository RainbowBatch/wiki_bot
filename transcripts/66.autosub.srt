1
00:00:04,096 --> 00:00:10,240
Alexandra Thurston color

2
00:00:16,896 --> 00:00:18,176
Specific to the twist

3
00:00:18,432 --> 00:00:19,200
Of yesterday

4
00:00:23,552 --> 00:00:26,624
Lestrange

5
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:36,864
We are going back to our roots

6
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,144
The root

7
00:00:38,656 --> 00:00:42,752
And the reason was given to me by Dan as

8
00:00:45,056 --> 00:00:46,592
We might have to brace ourselves

9
00:00:46,848 --> 00:00:48,896
Steel Reserve

10
00:00:50,944 --> 00:00:53,504
I think that we've been getting July Reserve

11
00:00:54,016 --> 00:00:56,064
You know we got a lot of food squared away we

12
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:57,088
The cover it

13
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:05,024
Think about it

14
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:10,656
Amen and I realized

15
00:01:10,912 --> 00:01:11,680
About

16
00:01:11,936 --> 00:01:16,288
The people were posting T-Bone Iver video meme

17
00:01:17,568 --> 00:01:19,872
I was right

18
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,920
I was way too mad

19
00:01:22,432 --> 00:01:28,576
And I don't like that I wanted Alex Jones facsimile rhymes

20
00:01:28,832 --> 00:01:34,976
Screaming really likes

21
00:01:35,488 --> 00:01:36,512
Solution is let's get drunk

22
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:41,376
Kind of thoughts recently where

23
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:47,264
Are we becoming the anti Alex Jones like there's been a couple of things where I

24
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,288
I've noticed like

25
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:49,312
Sing back

26
00:01:50,848 --> 00:01:51,360
Oh that's

27
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:52,384
Exactly

28
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,432
But we don't build up false narrative

29
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:55,200
A specific

30
00:01:55,456 --> 00:01:59,040
Purpose narrative

31
00:01:59,296 --> 00:01:59,808
First Pacific

32
00:02:00,576 --> 00:02:05,696
Which is the anti Alex

33
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,816
Tear down the wall

34
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:13,888
Adjectives

35
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:14,656
David Hasselhoff

36
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:23,104
Like I want to also say that

37
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,664
Like I said

38
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:29,504
Derecho

39
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,296
Start back up vocals

40
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:36,672
I want to say is that about that Bon Iver video I'm totally right

41
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,280
Twice we have

42
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:42,304
Confirm.

43
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,072
What is right

44
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:53,056
The $20,000 contest for people to make parody versions of the parody song about him

45
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:59,456
Yep and that's what I am saying he's going to do what he does all the time with this trip

46
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:00,480
But

47
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:02,784
To talk about it yourself.

48
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,344
You should have given me a little

49
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,368
Like damn you're so right

50
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:08,416
The reason I brought it up

51
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:11,232
Congratulatory note is

52
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:13,280
Because I know exactly what the

53
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:14,048
Plan is

54
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:16,352
For what this contest is going to achieve

55
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,704
He's basically going to have all the all the lyrics

56
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,240
Of the parody song

57
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:24,544
On his website on infowars.com

58
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:27,872
And what are you going to have people do in the winter who ends up winning

59
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:29,920
$10,000 / 20,000

60
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:31,456
Cuz it's broken down

61
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:32,224
It's 3 price

62
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:33,504
1

63
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,784
4 best parody

64
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,320
That's 10,000

65
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:41,696
Person who films at in the best location

66
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:44,512
Their videos

67
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:50,912
Congress is that a way to avoid paying out that five probably

68
00:03:51,424 --> 00:03:52,192
I know he's going to do

69
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:58,592
All the lyrics

70
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,200
He's going to

71
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:04,480
Essentially

72
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:06,016
Get people to

73
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:07,552
To try and reinforce

74
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:10,112
The Lions and that song that people are making fun of

75
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:11,648
So it'll be like

76
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:13,440
We love our somalis

77
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:17,280
I'm at you know flash up on the screen something about how somalis kill people

78
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:19,327
It's going to be a thing where you takes

79
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:21,631
His propaganda and it's reinforced

80
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:23,679
Of that parodies

81
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:28,031
All of it true they do want to eat

82
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:31,359
You guys are fighting a losing battle

83
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:33,151
Anyway

84
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:35,199
It's going to be a bummer

85
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:41,855
But the good news is way less people will see that Feherty version Bengali version

86
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:43,647
Something to be said for that

87
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:50,815
Let's get into greener pastures and happy things would like to give a shout out to a couple

88
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:55,679

Today we're going to be going over a investigation where we go

101
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:55,583
2015 and find out what the f*** happened to make Alex Jones go crazy

102

Due September 17th

103
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:58,143
This is

104
00:05:58,655 --> 00:05:59,679
This is

105
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:01,471
Like what

106
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:03,007
This started in

107
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:04,031
June

108
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:10,431
Our investigation began June 15th

109
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:16,831
How is this how is this still going on with his

110
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:17,855
Is full-on like

111
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:25,279
2017

112
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:31,935
Substantial

113
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:35,263
No

114
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:36,031
The weather

115
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:37,567
The 73 - 14

116
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:38,591
The end

117
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:40,639
Of his big-money bomb

118
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:41,919
We've discussed

119
00:06:42,175 --> 00:06:44,735
Opportunity

120
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:47,295
Bizarro money to come flowing in

121
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:49,343
To the show

122
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:52,159
I don't know we'll see

123
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:53,439
He get into like

124
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:57,535
And a lot of $1 bills

125
00:06:57,791 --> 00:07:00,863
Kind of around him lie.

126
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:03,167
Yeah

127
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:08,543
As many of them as you can in order to help

128
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:10,335
Do you want your bills covered

129
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:11,615
Getting a tattoo

130
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:12,383
I don't know

131
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:15,967
That's way more fun than about $10,000

132
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:17,247
No

133
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:18,527
Fly somebody

134
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:21,599
Put them in a tube and throw $1 bills at that

135
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:31,583
Ben 10 grand for the story for the experience

136
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:34,911
Can you go and see how we're all going and

137
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:42,847
Alex Jones

138
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:53,087
I don't know how that works

139
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:55,647
Never attain full consciousness

140
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:01,791
I can't judge

141
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:27,135
I'm trying to figure out why these demons from

142
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:30,975
Conscious

143
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:38,143
I don't know it's just food for thought I don't know

144
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:41,471
I love the the mind-killer reference

145
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:45,823
Two gang everybody knows

146
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:48,383
Play

147
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:49,919
I completely f***** up

148
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:54,015
I forgot that I know I forgot the video

149
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:56,831
I forgot that I had another thing I wanted to discuss

150
00:08:57,087 --> 00:08:58,623
Before we got into our main episode

151
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:00,159
So guys forgive me

152
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:01,951
But I have another clip

153
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:05,023
I recently

154
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:08,351
I don't have permission to play this but I'm going to anyway I hope he doesn't

155
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:09,375
Recently

156
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:11,679
Jimmy Pardo on never not funny

157
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:12,959
Had Tom Arnold

158
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:19,615
Had a very interesting story about some of the people that are involved in our universe

159
00:09:19,871 --> 00:09:24,223
Comes up in this clip Mike cernovich

160
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:25,503
And

161
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:29,855
Alleged Nazi

162
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:32,159
This Sandra Bullock

163
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:35,231
Also it Lads not to no no no no no no

164
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:37,023
Hi when I heard

165
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:38,815
Squealed with delight and I want to play

166
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:42,143
For those of you out in the world do not have never not funny

167
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:44,703
I don't get the episodes

168
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:48,543
Enjoy

169
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:36,927
Barely was

170
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:49,983
Pizza

171
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:27,871
Everything

172
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:32,223
He wrote a book called gorilla

173
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:36,319
Is about

174
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:52,703
Unfortunately

175
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:56,031
And that's what really happened

176
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:06,783
Different than the version That's Mike cernovich towels

177
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:08,575
Also I'll tell you this

178
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:11,135
We get to use that clip

179
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:17,535
Parto a part of headline to show that I was emptying and

180
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:20,863
20 minutes

181
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:27,263
All right we got the

182
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:32,383
And some sort of bizarre Feud about using a clip of Tom Arnold

183
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:39,807
The terminal does realize that Mike cernovich

184
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:43,391
Calling Tom Arnold

185
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:48,767
After they had already agreed to have a celebrity boxing match just another version of promotion

186
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:52,607
Perfectly

187
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:55,935
His wife couldn't follow through

188
00:12:56,191 --> 00:12:57,215
If Tom Arnold

189
00:12:57,471 --> 00:12:58,751
Doesn't have his

190
00:12:59,007 --> 00:12:59,519
Beat out of them

191
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:00,799
Yeah

192
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:05,151
The whole game is over even if it's closed

193
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:06,175
Like it's like

194
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:12,063
Oh it's closed at the disaster for Saturday or Jesse James

195
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:15,903
That you got beat up

196
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:18,207
If I feel bad about it

197
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:19,743
It'll probably be like

198
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:21,279
For the experience

199
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:25,375
Anyway

200
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:31,007
Anyway as I set up on the outside of the state

201
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:37,663
Is that a stealth raises thing about juice now I realize Ed

202
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:41,247
Oh well anyway

203
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:44,575
I just like to bring up anytime in pop culture we get

204
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:46,367
Evidence that these dudes are wack is

205
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:47,647
So

206
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:49,439
Behind the scenes

207
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:50,975
They had already agreed

208
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:52,767
Is what his point is

209
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:54,047
And then they back out

210
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:55,327
Yep that is

211
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:57,631
That is the most Vedic movie

212
00:13:57,887 --> 00:13:59,167
You can do

213
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:05,567
Challenging him and then getting biker Jesse James to stand in for him I use you as

214
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:09,919
Game of Thrones ship

215
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:11,455
You know exactly

216
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:18,111
Let's get to the episode Jordan

217
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:33,983
I feel like we've done decent job staying where we left off the money bomb is coming up

218
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:34,751
Alex Jones

219
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:39,103
Is clearly needing money at the end of the fiscal year these to try and raise a million dollars

220
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:41,663
Fans only

221
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:47,039
Said basically that he likes what Trump is saying but he doesn't trust him still

222
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:51,903
September 6th starts the show

223
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:54,719
Honestly

224
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:07,007
Usually Cumberbatch

225
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:15,967
Maybe a happy cuz when you look at this world

226
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:16,991
Call Jennifer Katz

227
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:23,647
Your cat doesn't love you

228
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:28,767
I don't need a scientific study to show me

229
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:31,839
You have one cat

230
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:37,983
Because no animal has ever loved

231
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:39,007
My stomach

232
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:43,615
But they could care less about fell down and died tomorrow

233
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:47,967
When I'm Gone

234
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:50,015
He wants a free

235
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:54,623
Basically died of heart attacks

236
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:55,903
If something happened to me

237
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:59,487
Spiritual connection

238
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:02,559
If that

239
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:09,727
I'm a dog person.

240
00:16:10,239 --> 00:16:10,751
Great

241
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:17,151
Batman

242
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:18,175
You think you're cool

243
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:20,223
Only care about yourself

244
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:28,415
Go to the bathroom

245
00:16:28,671 --> 00:16:31,487
Can you check on everyone else you put on yourself

246
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:34,303
These are just Elementary understandings here

247
00:16:34,559 --> 00:16:35,071
Right

248
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:37,887
Prairie

249
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:42,495
I let you look at the cat to our practice

250
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:43,519
Ivana

251
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:45,567
Merton foremost

252
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:54,015
Cats are cute cats are funny but make no mistake

253
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:56,831
Be there for you

254
00:16:59,391 --> 00:17:00,927
Stand up for you

255
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:02,207
Goodwill

256
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:06,047
You don't hear about cops going people's houses and shooting a cat studio

257
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:08,607
Because they're not cowards

258
00:17:18,591 --> 00:17:21,407
Dog Society

259
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:25,247
Trying to make a point about the world while at the same time

260
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:31,647
Trying to work out some material for a weekend

261
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:38,559
A real castle would be like this

262
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:45,983
Yeah you said it

263
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:50,335
Haribol

264
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:51,103
Hacking

265
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:51,871
Nonsense

266
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:56,479
Yeah

267
00:17:56,735 --> 00:17:58,783
Kind of love you know that's how cats and dogs are

268
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:01,855
Dogs are simple cancer complex there we go

269
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:06,463
Now I'm getting it done

270
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:09,279
People who explained

271
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:13,375
I got nothing for that

272
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:15,423
I think is an indication of how

273
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:17,215
How often does like

274
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:19,263
The Sunday shows are low stakes

275
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:21,823
He knows that not many people are watching

276
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:23,871
And so it just kind of feel time

277
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:28,223
So why not start off the show the five minutes

278
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:32,319
About why don't cops kill your house

279
00:18:32,575 --> 00:18:35,903
Right out of the gate

280
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:42,303
Sometimes I feel like I got to get into all of this news today

281
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:46,911
So he doesn't stay on that beat

282
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:48,191
You feel the same way

283
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:49,727
What time are is

284
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:52,799
Interesting

285
00:18:53,055 --> 00:18:56,639
Take on the property

286
00:18:56,895 --> 00:18:59,455
Michelle

287
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:05,855
Take on the properties on the property

288
00:19:06,111 --> 00:19:06,879
I think they would have to

289
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:11,743
I mean there's got to be some sort of genetic influence from the post animal

290
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:13,279
Sad

291
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:17,631
Humans aren't sad all the time

292
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:20,191
We have no idea what the psychology

293
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:23,263
Animal

294
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:27,615
Really depressing thing

295
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:32,735
Scientists reveal that fish are all depressed all the time

296
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:35,295
But nothing else

297
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:38,111
A very long

298
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:40,671
He does killing your fish

299
00:19:41,183 --> 00:19:42,975
That's a good point

300
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:44,511
He does get weird

301
00:19:47,327 --> 00:19:49,119
Indispensable

302
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:53,215
I don't think if pressed

303
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:55,263
He could explain what the f*** you talking

304
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:57,567
And here is the first of those clips

305
00:19:57,823 --> 00:20:03,967
Books like echoes

306
00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:11,903
Think they're Gods they say the public

307
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:12,927
Like you say

308
00:20:13,183 --> 00:20:15,487
At a spiritual Intergalactic level

309
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:17,279
An Interstellar

310
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:21,631
There Are Rules just written by God

311
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:27,519
Something

312
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:29,823
Then you are a queen

313
00:20:30,335 --> 00:20:30,847
That's

314
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:31,615
Really weird

315
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:33,407
Interstellar left

316
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:35,455
Intergalactic light

317
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:39,551
About Makati

318
00:20:40,575 --> 00:20:44,927
God wrote that rule on the universe

319
00:20:45,183 --> 00:20:45,695
Just keep living

320
00:20:45,951 --> 00:20:46,975
That's what we do

321
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:49,791
The super Bazaar

322
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:52,095
He's expressing the belief that

323
00:20:53,631 --> 00:20:56,703
Do you know if you don't fight back against something you consent to it

324
00:20:57,215 --> 00:20:57,983
Yeah

325
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:00,287
I disagree with

326
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:01,055
How he wants

327
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:05,151
He's defeated

328
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:06,943
Denying the nerve

329
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:07,967
The Nuremberg

330
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:14,111
I was just

331
00:21:14,623 --> 00:21:15,135
Orders

332
00:21:15,647 --> 00:21:17,184
Is not an actual defense

333
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:18,720
Towards you

334
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:20,512
Putting Jews into account

335
00:21:21,536 --> 00:21:22,048
Right you know

336
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:23,584
So

337
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:24,352
He is right

338
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:28,704
And it's something that I've talked about earlier I talked about

339
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:29,728
Lady witches

340
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,288
Everyday that I'm not protesting

341
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:34,336
The mistreatment of black p

342
00:21:35,872 --> 00:21:36,384
F******

343
00:21:37,152 --> 00:21:43,296
I am

344
00:21:46,112 --> 00:21:47,904
I think it's a little more complicated

345
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,440
Bad well that's because you're a cat

346
00:21:49,952 --> 00:21:55,840
I don't think there are Universal rules

347
00:21:56,096 --> 00:21:57,632
Especially in the way that he's presenting

348
00:21:59,168 --> 00:21:59,680
Globalist

349
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:05,568
Like Bertrand Russell ecosciences bring it up the recent

350
00:22:07,104 --> 00:22:09,408
Writing in the 30s right

351
00:22:09,664 --> 00:22:10,432
John P holdren

352
00:22:10,688 --> 00:22:13,248
Text bookie cosine

353
00:22:13,504 --> 00:22:15,808
Yep does not say the things that he says

354
00:22:16,832 --> 00:22:22,976
You think they're putting this out there they're giving the information of what they're doing to you and if you don't fight back

355
00:22:23,232 --> 00:22:24,256
Then you just accept it

356
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:27,584
And that's cockamamie because he's lying about what those

357
00:22:28,352 --> 00:22:31,680
Eco science textbook

358
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:35,264
It doesn't say dumb down the population

359
00:22:35,776 --> 00:22:36,544
It's a f******

360
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:39,872
It doesn't matter

361
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,456
Anyway

362
00:22:44,224 --> 00:22:45,504
I'm still mad about the jogging

363
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:47,552
I couldn't even listen to

364
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,904
Pretty weird also I'm telling you

365
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:54,464
Interstellar the plot mechanics are not

366
00:22:54,976 --> 00:22:55,488
Okay

367
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,096
Great when you're on Doug Loves movies

368
00:23:07,008 --> 00:23:08,288
What time is it the Rosemont

369
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:11,360
Whatever

370
00:23:11,872 --> 00:23:18,016
But I'm telling you this next clip is much weirder I invited oversold how weird that clip is I think it's f******

371
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:21,344
But he believes that there is Interstellar rule

372
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,624
That's very weird

373
00:23:23,392 --> 00:23:24,160
B next clip

374
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:25,184
Is there a

375
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:27,488
I think it's undeniably weird

376
00:23:27,744 --> 00:23:30,048
And I think that people lining up

377
00:23:30,304 --> 00:23:31,328
40

378
00:23:31,584 --> 00:23:32,352
New iPhone

379
00:23:32,608 --> 00:23:33,888
That's technology

380
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:43,360
Analogy

381
00:23:46,688 --> 00:23:52,832
Is evil of this world

382
00:23:53,088 --> 00:23:54,368
The elite all know that

383
00:23:54,624 --> 00:23:57,440
They're just they're dumb in the public down

384
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:04,352
Not like she's eating after the elves we are the elf

385
00:24:11,008 --> 00:24:15,360
They want to play Godly run around watching NFL that's what the joke is

386
00:24:16,128 --> 00:24:19,456
Vinny favorite item

387
00:24:19,968 --> 00:24:21,760
My idol is myself

388
00:24:22,016 --> 00:24:28,160
Tell me the truth

389
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:31,744
And

390
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,328
Try and reach as many as we can

391
00:24:38,656 --> 00:24:44,800
This is not only that would put stuff in vaccines to lower IQ

392
00:24:54,784 --> 00:25:00,928
Bunch of retarded idiot

393
00:25:07,584 --> 00:25:13,728
You are you are

394
00:25:13,984 --> 00:25:20,128
Creations that dominates you

395
00:25:24,224 --> 00:25:28,064
True Humanity

396
00:25:29,088 --> 00:25:31,136
They will go to hell before they

397
00:25:37,024 --> 00:25:38,304
Jamaica

398
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:40,096
Just get that straight.

399
00:25:40,352 --> 00:25:46,496
Failed they're scum selected

400
00:25:48,288 --> 00:25:49,568
We win for eternity

401
00:25:49,824 --> 00:25:51,104
Jesus Christ

402
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:03,648
I am tired of these people

403
00:26:05,696 --> 00:26:10,816
Man

404
00:26:11,072 --> 00:26:12,608
Man-o-man

405
00:26:12,864 --> 00:26:16,192
That is smooth as silk

406
00:26:16,448 --> 00:26:20,032
Hearth

407
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:25,408
I think most Christians believe that right

408
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:32,576
Anything outside of like the weirdest

409
00:26:33,088 --> 00:26:35,136
Theosophy like the weirdest

410
00:26:35,392 --> 00:26:37,440
Pseudo spiritualism

411
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:41,792
I mean I guess there is a little bit on the seventh day God rested

412
00:26:43,328 --> 00:26:48,192
To the negative first day was like

413
00:26:48,448 --> 00:26:52,288
It goes into a little bit of vaguely Gnostic beliefs

414
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:55,104
There is a tiny bit of

415
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:59,712
Pieces of your spirit predate Humanity everything

416
00:27:02,272 --> 00:27:06,880
I liked a little bit of Internet message boards Illuminati talk

417
00:27:08,672 --> 00:27:10,208
And the idea that he presented

418
00:27:10,464 --> 00:27:11,744
Vivi's globalist

419
00:27:12,512 --> 00:27:18,656
They all of their therefore is to be a challenge for us to get to the next level

420
00:27:18,912 --> 00:27:21,984
Within Christianity

421
00:27:22,752 --> 00:27:28,384
But it also goes to the ideas that have been pitched on internet message boards about the Illuminati

422
00:27:28,896 --> 00:27:32,224
So with all of the and with all of the b******* that we

423
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,272
Deal with

424
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:35,552
Said that weird

425
00:27:35,808 --> 00:27:36,320
Religious Act

426
00:27:37,344 --> 00:27:41,184
Has so much more of a ring of Truth to him

427
00:27:42,976 --> 00:27:44,000
What is a verb

428
00:27:44,256 --> 00:27:46,048
What are you saying

429
00:27:46,304 --> 00:27:48,096
Teaching the elves we are the

430
00:27:48,608 --> 00:27:49,120
Yeah

431
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:49,888
It feels like

432
00:27:52,448 --> 00:27:56,544
Like terrible

433
00:27:57,056 --> 00:27:58,080
If you guys understand

434
00:27:58,592 --> 00:27:59,360
You got

435
00:27:59,616 --> 00:28:00,128
YouWager

436
00:28:00,384 --> 00:28:00,896
Yeah

437
00:28:01,152 --> 00:28:05,504
I wonder who talked about the DMT machine

438
00:28:06,016 --> 00:28:08,064
You know when people take DMT they often

439
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:08,832
MC machinery

440
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:10,624
I don't know what that means

441
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:13,440
A tall dimethyltryptamine is a substance

442
00:28:17,792 --> 00:28:20,096
And when you do a lot of people

443
00:28:21,376 --> 00:28:22,400
I don't know what the

444
00:28:23,424 --> 00:28:24,448
I have taken at my

445
00:28:24,704 --> 00:28:25,984
But a lot of people report

446
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:29,824
I suppose the next episode

447
00:28:33,664 --> 00:28:38,272
You can't move elucidating so hard

448
00:28:38,528 --> 00:28:42,880
But a lot of people report that they seem elves working gears

449
00:28:43,136 --> 00:28:44,160
I am machine

450
00:28:45,696 --> 00:28:46,976
Some people have speculated that

451
00:28:47,232 --> 00:28:49,792
Behind the veil of reality DMT allows you to

452
00:28:50,304 --> 00:28:50,816
Beyond

453
00:28:52,352 --> 00:28:55,168
Elves

454
00:28:55,424 --> 00:28:56,448
Machinery

455
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:02,080
That create whatever we see in our our reality

456
00:29:03,872 --> 00:29:06,176
Countries that have helped factories

457
00:29:06,432 --> 00:29:10,528
Let's go any further down this road let's okay

458
00:29:12,064 --> 00:29:17,184
Establish that we're doing an eight and a half hour logout

459
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:20,000
Never drinking wine over to Everest

460
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:23,584
August 6th

461
00:29:26,912 --> 00:29:28,704
And then in addition to that

462
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:29,472
We start

463
00:29:29,728 --> 00:29:30,752
To be this creeping

464
00:29:32,544 --> 00:29:33,824
Pro-russia stamps

465
00:29:34,592 --> 00:29:39,200
The beginnings of it starting to develop

466
00:29:39,456 --> 00:29:41,248
But that was more like

467
00:29:41,504 --> 00:29:42,784
Pro strongman

468
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:45,600
The mail

469
00:29:45,856 --> 00:29:47,136
Yeah

470
00:29:47,392 --> 00:29:48,416
We're starting

471
00:29:48,672 --> 00:29:49,440
Be a little bit more of it

472
00:29:52,512 --> 00:29:56,352
Assad

473
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,912
Show tragic plight of refugees

474
00:29:59,168 --> 00:30:02,240
5 years ago watches Al-Qaeda

475
00:30:02,496 --> 00:30:05,568
In Syria kills 300,000 of these innocent people

476
00:30:06,592 --> 00:30:09,664
Serious fight back we call them terrorists

477
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:13,504
Media says it quote.

478
00:30:15,296 --> 00:30:17,600
Nashua dead little two-year-old toddler

479
00:30:18,112 --> 00:30:22,976
In the sand that won't show the tens of thousands of dead babies that I've seen online

480
00:30:23,232 --> 00:30:24,768
Eonline

481
00:30:25,024 --> 00:30:27,840
They were killed by western-backed rebels in Syria

482
00:30:28,352 --> 00:30:30,400
So they create the crisis of the shapes

483
00:30:30,656 --> 00:30:31,936
Look up

484
00:30:33,216 --> 00:30:33,728
Look

485
00:30:38,848 --> 00:30:40,640
Compare that compares

486
00:30:40,896 --> 00:30:41,408
Bulshit

487
00:30:41,664 --> 00:30:42,688
Empathy

488
00:30:44,736 --> 00:30:47,808
Somebody like when terrorist attack

489
00:30:50,112 --> 00:30:56,256
In all of the people who look at how right and then he pretends to give

490
00:30:56,768 --> 00:30:58,304
F*** about that lips

491
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:03,680
And

492
00:31:04,192 --> 00:31:05,984
Complete

493
00:31:06,496 --> 00:31:07,264
That doesn't count

494
00:31:10,592 --> 00:31:11,360
Fake bowls

495
00:31:13,408 --> 00:31:19,552
Basically Russia

496
00:31:19,808 --> 00:31:21,344
Well actually you know

497
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:23,392
Is Labor Day

498
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:26,976
So you don't have a show

499
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:32,608
Union holiday

500
00:31:32,864 --> 00:31:35,680
Well I think you love the free market

501
00:31:35,936 --> 00:31:36,960
Prosperity

502
00:31:37,216 --> 00:31:37,728
That he has to be

503
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:40,544
A day to celebrate

504
00:31:41,056 --> 00:31:43,616
Union he does actually make a little bit of a point

505
00:31:46,688 --> 00:31:47,456
I got to get my

506
00:31:47,712 --> 00:31:48,480
My fever

507
00:31:50,016 --> 00:31:51,040
Are we come back on

508
00:31:51,296 --> 00:31:53,344
8 +

509
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,904
Still on his b******* about Russia being the good guy

510
00:32:00,512 --> 00:32:01,280
Because

511
00:32:01,792 --> 00:32:03,584
This is the reality of what's Happening

512
00:32:04,352 --> 00:32:06,656
All the other news

513
00:32:17,408 --> 00:32:19,200
Refugees from coming here

514
00:32:19,456 --> 00:32:20,224
See I mean

515
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:24,576
That's not that's not in and of itself

516
00:32:25,088 --> 00:32:25,600
An evil thing

517
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:27,392
Wrong

518
00:32:28,416 --> 00:32:28,928
Syria.

519
00:32:29,184 --> 00:32:31,744
Good things

520
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,072
Pattern developing over the course of

521
00:32:35,584 --> 00:32:38,656
Early September just outright

522
00:32:38,912 --> 00:32:40,960
Russian guy we're the Bad Guy

523
00:32:41,728 --> 00:32:43,008
Really bizarre

524
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:45,568
It's really bizarre considering Alex Jones

525
00:32:47,872 --> 00:32:48,896
Just got to be played into

526
00:32:49,152 --> 00:32:53,504
So much Roosa phobia is early career and the Last Time Rush

527
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:54,784
The favor was in World War

528
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:57,600
That was the very last

529
00:32:58,368 --> 00:32:59,136
Yeah damn

530
00:32:59,392 --> 00:33:03,488
So I don't know I don't know what to make of it is really interesting that

531
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,304
If we look at the timeline of the world

532
00:33:07,072 --> 00:33:07,584
It seems like

533
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:08,352
Summer

534
00:33:08,608 --> 00:33:09,120
Fall

535
00:33:09,376 --> 00:33:09,888
Of

536
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,424
2005

537
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:12,704
Is when something

538
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:16,032
Really sucks

539
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:19,104
Might be the branching points

540
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:25,504
When are our world could have gone one way or the other and we went the wrong way

541
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:28,064
That's when

542
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:28,832
Is starting

543
00:33:29,088 --> 00:33:29,600
YouTube

544
00:33:30,112 --> 00:33:34,720
Warm to Trump

545
00:33:34,976 --> 00:33:35,744
On his show

546
00:33:36,512 --> 00:33:39,840
I don't think so but it's weird

547
00:33:40,608 --> 00:33:41,888
The thing that I

548
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:42,912
Think about

549
00:33:43,168 --> 00:33:43,680
Pretty

550
00:33:45,728 --> 00:33:46,752
What's the balance

551
00:33:47,264 --> 00:33:47,776
Between

552
00:33:49,568 --> 00:33:50,848
Advantage of a situation

553
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:51,872
And Putin

554
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:55,968
Right so all of these guys right

555
00:33:56,224 --> 00:33:57,248
Now in 2000

556
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:02,112
We'll look at this strong man doing

557
00:34:02,624 --> 00:34:04,928
How much is that

558
00:34:05,696 --> 00:34:06,464
Russian proper

559
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:07,488
Ganda steeping

560
00:34:07,744 --> 00:34:09,536
Out and then gone

561
00:34:10,304 --> 00:34:10,816
If not

562
00:34:11,328 --> 00:34:12,096
Himself directly but

563
00:34:12,864 --> 00:34:14,144
His circle of oligarch

564
00:34:15,936 --> 00:34:16,960
This is something we can

565
00:34:18,752 --> 00:34:19,776
And how much is

566
00:34:20,032 --> 00:34:21,568
Directly

567
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:22,848
Look at what I do

568
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:23,872
Like that

569
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:26,944
As it relates to Alex

570
00:34:27,968 --> 00:34:30,272
He's taking in like Artie and Sputnik

571
00:34:31,552 --> 00:34:33,600
Getting the Russian line as

572
00:34:33,856 --> 00:34:34,368
True

573
00:34:34,624 --> 00:34:35,648
Because it's more appealing

574
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:38,208
Masculine culture

575
00:34:38,464 --> 00:34:40,000
I'm at they've kicked out the globalist

576
00:34:40,768 --> 00:34:44,352
And therefore their media is much more reliable than ours

577
00:34:44,608 --> 00:34:46,656
Ours is just full of propaganda

578
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:48,704
And CIA plant

579
00:34:49,216 --> 00:34:50,240
Better in the media

580
00:34:50,496 --> 00:34:51,520
And Sookie just

581
00:34:52,032 --> 00:34:53,568
I have no reason to doubt things

582
00:34:53,824 --> 00:34:54,336
Is it come from

583
00:34:54,848 --> 00:34:58,944
There are Outlets

584
00:34:59,200 --> 00:34:59,712
See through these

585
00:34:59,968 --> 00:35:01,504
People's eyes

586
00:35:03,296 --> 00:35:04,320
It could not be

587
00:35:07,648 --> 00:35:09,696
Is a state-controlled media

588
00:35:12,512 --> 00:35:14,048
What the state wants you to

589
00:35:14,816 --> 00:35:16,864
Yeah like it can't be more

590
00:35:17,632 --> 00:35:18,144
So how come

591
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,424
Can you not

592
00:35:20,704 --> 00:35:22,752
You don't want to

593
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:30,944
I mean I do understand though because

594
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:34,272
If you built your entire life like if you're Alex G

595
00:35:35,296 --> 00:35:36,320
2050

596
00:35:39,648 --> 00:35:40,160
Maybe

597
00:35:42,464 --> 00:35:44,512
Migrated

598
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:45,536
Stalking with his a

599
00:35:45,792 --> 00:35:48,864
Entire life around

600
00:35:51,424 --> 00:35:52,448
You said we have this

601
00:35:52,704 --> 00:35:53,216
We have those

602
00:35:54,752 --> 00:35:57,056
Dark timeline versus the lights

603
00:35:57,312 --> 00:35:57,824
Damn

604
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:58,592
Where in

605
00:35:58,848 --> 00:35:59,616
Either or

606
00:36:00,896 --> 00:36:01,664
Really confront the

607
00:36:02,944 --> 00:36:03,712
What I believe

608
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:06,272
Israel

609
00:36:07,296 --> 00:36:08,064
For they do

610
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:08,832
DoubleDown

611
00:36:09,088 --> 00:36:09,600
They Double Down

612
00:36:09,856 --> 00:36:10,368
And of course

613
00:36:11,136 --> 00:36:12,928
Rollies new episode

614
00:36:13,184 --> 00:36:16,256
Whatever's happening

615
00:36:18,048 --> 00:36:23,424
The entire politics

616
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:25,728
2015 was the

617
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:28,032
The Firm cementing

618
00:36:29,056 --> 00:36:30,336
There will never be a

619
00:36:30,592 --> 00:36:31,360
Shared reality

620
00:36:31,872 --> 00:36:32,640
Call Totally

621
00:36:32,896 --> 00:36:36,992
Like Fox News

622
00:36:37,248 --> 00:36:38,784
Toughman it started

623
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:40,064
Like it Regan

624
00:36:40,576 --> 00:36:46,464
You're absolutely right

625
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:48,512
Lobbying really took off

626
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:52,096
But that I feel like is whenever it

627
00:36:52,608 --> 00:36:53,376
This is

628
00:36:53,632 --> 00:36:54,144
How it's going to be

629
00:36:54,912 --> 00:36:59,264
Yeah things wrapped up to

630
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,800
I think it's because

631
00:37:01,056 --> 00:37:04,128
People realize that election was coming up

632
00:37:05,664 --> 00:37:07,456
And they realize that

633
00:37:07,712 --> 00:37:08,992
It was win or lose at that point

634
00:37:09,504 --> 00:37:10,016
Yeah and

635
00:37:10,272 --> 00:37:15,648
The trends in society that we could see were like well if something doesn't happen Democrats are never going to lose another election

636
00:37:15,904 --> 00:37:22,048
Because that's the way Society is going

637
00:37:23,072 --> 00:37:24,352
I am that is

638
00:37:31,264 --> 00:37:33,312
Right

639
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:38,688
There doesn't seem like there's any shot there

640
00:37:38,944 --> 00:37:39,968
Because they were the ones

641
00:37:40,224 --> 00:37:40,736
To realize

642
00:37:41,248 --> 00:37:41,760
That

643
00:37:42,016 --> 00:37:43,552
The only way

644
00:37:44,832 --> 00:37:45,600
Too lenient

645
00:37:45,856 --> 00:37:46,368
To being the wife

646
00:37:46,624 --> 00:37:47,136
Supremacist

647
00:37:47,648 --> 00:37:48,928
Because if you look at that

648
00:37:50,208 --> 00:37:50,976
The

649
00:37:51,232 --> 00:37:52,768
GOP autopsy

650
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,304
They did on the two

651
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:55,072
12 election

652
00:37:55,328 --> 00:37:56,352
Is all about

653
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:58,656
We need to return back to the Big Ten

654
00:37:59,168 --> 00:38:00,960
I need to expand we need to

655
00:38:01,216 --> 00:38:03,264
Find more Latino voters

656
00:38:03,776 --> 00:38:04,288
Need to do all of this

657
00:38:05,056 --> 00:38:05,824
And they took

658
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:06,592
None of that

659
00:38:07,104 --> 00:38:08,640
I didn't mean to

660
00:38:08,896 --> 00:38:12,224
Stanford Federal

661
00:38:12,736 --> 00:38:13,248
Today went

662
00:38:13,504 --> 00:38:15,040
Straight

663
00:38:15,296 --> 00:38:17,344
And God bless them

664
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:19,136
I don't know

665
00:38:19,392 --> 00:38:23,232
Because they give us something to fight back again

666
00:38:23,488 --> 00:38:28,352
Diamond Audio Harley

667
00:38:28,608 --> 00:38:29,376
Alex Jones

668
00:38:29,632 --> 00:38:31,424
Has a long interview

669
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:38,336
Really long interview about how great

670
00:38:38,592 --> 00:38:39,616
Their products

671
00:38:39,872 --> 00:38:42,688
And about how

672
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:51,136
Both the same to scare people that are going to come while simultaneously being like

673
00:38:51,392 --> 00:38:52,416
Products are fuckingawesome

674
00:38:52,672 --> 00:38:54,720
They're spending way more time on the show.

675
00:38:54,976 --> 00:38:55,488
Trying to sell stuff

676
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,840
Periodic visits from Doctor Who comes in for like

677
00:39:00,096 --> 00:39:00,864
The hour-long

678
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:01,632
Session

679
00:39:02,144 --> 00:39:06,240
Gucci Artis on almost every day doing something

680
00:39:06,496 --> 00:39:07,776
To try and sell products

681
00:39:09,824 --> 00:39:10,848
That is not on

682
00:39:11,104 --> 00:39:11,616
Remarkable

683
00:39:11,872 --> 00:39:13,920
Part of the leader for the money

684
00:39:14,176 --> 00:39:16,992
Yeah so in the Muddy Bottom world

685
00:39:21,088 --> 00:39:21,600
After that

686
00:39:22,112 --> 00:39:23,904
Alex Jones interview with John McAfee

687
00:39:24,672 --> 00:39:25,696
Who created

688
00:39:25,952 --> 00:39:27,232
McAfee Security

689
00:39:27,488 --> 00:39:31,584
Every Windows computer with junk

690
00:39:32,864 --> 00:39:36,960
He's also the guy who may or may not have murdered his neighbor in South America

691
00:39:37,216 --> 00:39:38,752
I don't know if this is the case

692
00:39:39,008 --> 00:39:42,336
His neighbor wound up dead and he fled

693
00:39:43,104 --> 00:39:45,664
He was living down South of the Border

694
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:49,760
And his neighbor ended up dead and he was being

695
00:39:50,016 --> 00:39:51,296
Pursued by the police

696
00:39:51,552 --> 00:39:52,320
For questioning

697
00:39:52,576 --> 00:39:56,672
I don't I don't know if you did it I don't have no idea but I do know that he flies

698
00:39:57,184 --> 00:39:58,464
Eminem's house burned down

699
00:39:58,976 --> 00:40:02,816
As I understand the timeline

700
00:40:03,072 --> 00:40:06,656
I admit I haven't done a ton of research into it

701
00:40:06,912 --> 00:40:11,264
Hafizul Wild

702
00:40:12,032 --> 00:40:15,360
I'm not ready to say that no time you man

703
00:40:18,432 --> 00:40:19,200
Computer software

704
00:40:19,712 --> 00:40:20,480
And weird goatee

705
00:40:23,808 --> 00:40:25,856
Superhero McAfee is on

706
00:40:26,112 --> 00:40:26,880
Alex's

707
00:40:30,208 --> 00:40:30,720
Four presidents

708
00:40:32,256 --> 00:40:34,048
If Alex is super excited about it

709
00:40:34,304 --> 00:40:36,864
Cuz it McAfee has a deep libertarian pass

710
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:37,632
And what have you

711
00:40:37,888 --> 00:40:43,008
And anybody who would you like

712
00:40:43,264 --> 00:40:45,568
The full-on like we're going to build our own

713
00:40:46,592 --> 00:40:52,736
Why not if you can create a World online like when you create a world in real world

714
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:56,064
Alex Wood

715
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:58,624
Obviously

716
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:01,184
John McAfee is being like his whole

717
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:02,208
Storyline is

718
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:03,232
My age

719
00:41:03,488 --> 00:41:05,792
They went out and they filed paperwork

720
00:41:06,048 --> 00:41:07,072
For me to run for

721
00:41:09,376 --> 00:41:10,144
Yeah

722
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:11,680
Are you giving us the exclusive

723
00:41:11,936 --> 00:41:15,008
Are you going to run for president

724
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:16,544
I give you the exclusive

725
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,848
They filed some papers

726
00:41:19,104 --> 00:41:23,456
F*** you and that's really not a great exclusive like if I run

727
00:41:23,712 --> 00:41:24,480
I'm going to win

728
00:41:27,296 --> 00:41:28,576
He didn't run any didn't win

729
00:41:28,832 --> 00:41:32,928
But in the middle of their interview Alex Jones says really trouble

730
00:41:33,184 --> 00:41:36,000
Is he real

731
00:41:40,608 --> 00:41:41,888
They're really good

732
00:41:42,144 --> 00:41:46,752
We've got a radicalized

733
00:41:49,056 --> 00:41:55,199
I really am tired of that mentality because all of his that's exactly what he did because all of his stuff is based

734
00:41:55,455 --> 00:41:55,967
It's on live

735
00:41:59,295 --> 00:42:02,367
So he perceives an extreme enemy that he's up again

736
00:42:02,623 --> 00:42:05,695
It's okay for him to radicalize his

737
00:42:05,951 --> 00:42:06,719
Gorgeous

738
00:42:06,975 --> 00:42:08,255
Essentially what Terrace

739
00:42:08,511 --> 00:42:10,047
Yeah that's exactly what

740
00:42:14,399 --> 00:42:16,447
Isis has a better argument than he

741
00:42:16,703 --> 00:42:17,471
He does for radical

742
00:42:18,495 --> 00:42:19,775
Yeah I like

743
00:42:20,031 --> 00:42:25,407
Short of advocating

744
00:42:25,663 --> 00:42:27,199
Just on a logic basis

745
00:42:27,455 --> 00:42:30,271
Their argument does make more sense

746
00:42:30,527 --> 00:42:31,551
A real animal

747
00:42:32,575 --> 00:42:35,903
I like I

748
00:42:36,159 --> 00:42:37,439
Yeah and those don't make sense

749
00:42:39,743 --> 00:42:44,095
Certainly.

750
00:42:44,351 --> 00:42:46,655
Imagine imagine

751
00:42:46,911 --> 00:42:47,679
A terrorist group

752
00:42:48,191 --> 00:42:49,471
That was fighting again

753
00:42:50,239 --> 00:42:50,751
Imaginary

754
00:42:52,031 --> 00:42:52,799
Without

755
00:42:53,055 --> 00:42:53,823
Explosives we do

756
00:42:58,431 --> 00:42:59,199
Yeah

757
00:42:59,455 --> 00:43:00,479
Was radicalized

758
00:43:00,735 --> 00:43:01,503
Partly by Ali

759
00:43:02,015 --> 00:43:07,903
Partly I mean he's the most mainstream voice of the website

760
00:43:09,951 --> 00:43:11,231
Network of monsters

761
00:43:11,743 --> 00:43:13,023
Out there

762
00:43:13,279 --> 00:43:13,791
Yeezys

763
00:43:14,047 --> 00:43:15,839
He's responsible for a lot of terrible

764
00:43:16,351 --> 00:43:20,447
In the end of this episode we get a phone call from old man house phone

765
00:43:20,703 --> 00:43:22,751
He called Becca

766
00:43:23,519 --> 00:43:26,079
I love me some old man house phone

767
00:43:26,335 --> 00:43:27,871
Because it's boring

768
00:43:28,127 --> 00:43:30,175
But he wants to talk to John McAfee about guns

769
00:43:30,943 --> 00:43:31,711
Oh that's fun

770
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:36,063
It's just important to point out whenever house phone call then

771
00:43:38,879 --> 00:43:40,671
So we move on to the 10th

772
00:43:40,927 --> 00:43:43,743
Hold on let me backup

773
00:43:45,023 --> 00:43:46,047
I think I've forgotten

774
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:48,863
Is hazrat Portia

775
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:51,935
Jon rappoport

776
00:43:52,447 --> 00:43:56,287
And I'll tell you to the end of the money bomb build out there

777
00:43:56,543 --> 00:43:57,567
Bonjour

778
00:43:57,823 --> 00:43:59,615
Due September 9th

779
00:44:00,127 --> 00:44:02,175
On the show Alex Jones is very obsessed with

780
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:03,711
The story out of

781
00:44:03,967 --> 00:44:05,503
Where at

782
00:44:05,759 --> 00:44:07,039
A Ron's Barber Shop

783
00:44:07,551 --> 00:44:11,135
$50 for refusing to cut the hair of a lady

784
00:44:11,647 --> 00:44:14,207
Okay man

785
00:44:15,231 --> 00:44:17,279
Mouse.

786
00:44:17,535 --> 00:44:21,375
Like like the movie Barbershop like a white dude

787
00:44:22,399 --> 00:44:22,911
Second one

788
00:44:26,751 --> 00:44:27,263
I'm showing up on

789
00:44:27,775 --> 00:44:33,663
A lady went in the shop and you're not going to get

790
00:44:35,455 --> 00:44:36,991
Alright complain about this

791
00:44:37,247 --> 00:44:38,783
And they got fined $750

792
00:44:41,087 --> 00:44:43,903
Hey these guys just don't have the technology to cut ladies hair

793
00:44:45,695 --> 00:44:47,231
They they don't know how to do it

794
00:44:47,487 --> 00:44:51,071
But if you actually look into the story

795
00:44:51,327 --> 00:44:54,399
Confine that this dude is basically running The Man Show

796
00:44:54,655 --> 00:44:56,703
Out of a barbershop

797
00:44:56,959 --> 00:44:59,007
And his reason for not wanting to

798
00:44:59,263 --> 00:45:00,543
Like through a woman

799
00:45:00,799 --> 00:45:01,311
Who came in

800
00:45:01,567 --> 00:45:05,407
Was less about I don't know how to cut your hair predicated on

801
00:45:05,663 --> 00:45:07,455
This is where dude go to Hangouts

802
00:45:07,711 --> 00:45:13,599
He ends up calling in and they have an interview on a later show where he's like

803
00:45:13,855 --> 00:45:15,391
Montgomery

804
00:45:15,647 --> 00:45:16,415
Make jokes

805
00:45:16,671 --> 00:45:17,183
Some fart

806
00:45:17,439 --> 00:45:23,583
They can't do that if ladies like you should have gotten

807
00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:29,727
Clubhouse

808
00:45:29,983 --> 00:45:33,823
The Little Rascals absolutely

809
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:34,591
Azilect

810
00:45:34,847 --> 00:45:35,615
The stand-on in terms of

811
00:45:35,871 --> 00:45:36,383
Play

812
00:45:36,639 --> 00:45:39,199
Is that he doesn't really necessarily believe

813
00:45:39,455 --> 00:45:42,271
Everybody

814
00:45:42,527 --> 00:45:45,599
Yeah I believe that his libertarian beliefs

815
00:45:46,111 --> 00:45:47,647
If pressed he would say that a business

816
00:45:47,903 --> 00:45:49,951
Could deny service to African Americans

817
00:45:50,463 --> 00:45:52,511
If they wanted to

818
00:45:56,351 --> 00:45:58,143
All of the free market

819
00:45:58,655 --> 00:46:03,519
Example of a workout

820
00:46:04,543 --> 00:46:06,079
Is what is

821
00:46:06,335 --> 00:46:08,383
What kind of support of

822
00:46:08,639 --> 00:46:11,455
Barber shop

823
00:46:12,479 --> 00:46:15,551
But who cares

824
00:46:15,807 --> 00:46:16,831
Listing to me if

825
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:18,879
The guy really just does

826
00:46:21,695 --> 00:46:22,463
Use for it like

827
00:46:22,975 --> 00:46:24,511
Flag of his defense in

828
00:46:24,767 --> 00:46:25,279
Court was like

829
00:46:27,327 --> 00:46:27,839
Went to

830
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:30,399
I don't know

831
00:46:31,935 --> 00:46:32,447
I don't know how to cut

832
00:46:33,215 --> 00:46:33,727
I'm just go

833
00:46:33,983 --> 00:46:34,751
Copper hair

834
00:46:35,007 --> 00:46:35,519
Yeah

835
00:46:38,847 --> 00:46:42,431
That's borderline reasonable

836
00:46:42,687 --> 00:46:43,199
Is not

837
00:46:45,247 --> 00:46:45,759
Something

838
00:46:46,015 --> 00:46:47,807
Way more

839
00:46:50,879 --> 00:46:53,439
Important happens on the September 9th

840
00:46:54,463 --> 00:46:55,231
That day

841
00:46:55,487 --> 00:46:56,511
Before

842
00:46:57,023 --> 00:46:57,791
Donald Trump

843
00:46:58,303 --> 00:47:00,095
Came out and said some stuff about immigrants

844
00:47:03,423 --> 00:47:05,471
Has a very strong response to it

845
00:47:05,983 --> 00:47:07,775
And it might not be what you expect

846
00:47:08,287 --> 00:47:10,079
Donald Trump

847
00:47:18,015 --> 00:47:20,319
Cuz we have the moral High Ground

848
00:47:26,719 --> 00:47:28,511
This is suicide let's go to the clip

849
00:47:30,047 --> 00:47:36,191
Well it's a serious problem we haven't seen anything like it since the second world war and it's getting worse

850
00:47:36,447 --> 00:47:41,823
Edward said I was actually impressed in one way but surprised that Merkel in Germany allowed

851
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:48,223
This to happen because they're really flowing through all over Europe and if you notice Russia's not taking and

852
00:47:48,479 --> 00:47:54,623
China's not taking and the Gulf States

853
00:47:54,879 --> 00:48:01,023
But some of them are

854
00:48:04,607 --> 00:48:08,959
Really.

855
00:48:09,215 --> 00:48:11,007
84%

856
00:48:20,991 --> 00:48:23,551
Cross the place somalis at the Minnesota

857
00:48:30,719 --> 00:48:33,279
Welfare

858
00:48:45,567 --> 00:48:47,103
Dollars

859
00:48:48,639 --> 00:48:54,783
Holyshit

860
00:49:01,439 --> 00:49:02,463
This is

861
00:49:02,975 --> 00:49:03,999
Why

862
00:49:04,511 --> 00:49:05,023
Yeah

863
00:49:05,279 --> 00:49:10,655
Alex Jones on September 9th 2015

864
00:49:10,911 --> 00:49:12,191
That's more like

865
00:49:12,447 --> 00:49:15,007
Vitriol that's more passion than

866
00:49:15,263 --> 00:49:16,799
Yeah what's your shut your fat mouth

867
00:49:17,055 --> 00:49:18,847
Yeah for interested like

868
00:49:19,103 --> 00:49:25,247
That's exactly what he said fill your hands ya goddamn

869
00:49:26,783 --> 00:49:27,295
That is

870
00:49:27,551 --> 00:49:33,695
More passionate than all of the stuff you said about his mob ties in the past episode 3.

871
00:49:33,951 --> 00:49:35,231
That's super Bazaar

872
00:49:35,487 --> 00:49:40,351
Yeah that I don't know what to make of that

873
00:49:40,863 --> 00:49:42,143
Wow yeah

874
00:49:43,423 --> 00:49:43,935
What

875
00:49:46,239 --> 00:49:48,031
It should be over by now

876
00:49:49,055 --> 00:49:51,103
What's this song

877
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:52,383
Austin turns

878
00:49:52,639 --> 00:49:55,455
So on this show after this he has an interview with the sheriff

879
00:49:55,967 --> 00:49:56,991
I got

880
00:50:05,183 --> 00:50:07,999
Running for sheriff in Houston

881
00:50:08,255 --> 00:50:10,303
Okay this guy is

882
00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:11,071
Nuts

883
00:50:11,327 --> 00:50:16,703
He says that he thinks that Obama is creating racial Strife in order to cancel the 2016 election

884
00:50:17,727 --> 00:50:23,359
He does not win the election for Sheriff

885
00:50:24,639 --> 00:50:25,407
Just cancel them

886
00:50:27,967 --> 00:50:34,111
Good thing we have to deal with the militia Uprising easier the revolution out of the way pretty quick

887
00:50:34,367 --> 00:50:35,391
I just moved on

888
00:50:36,159 --> 00:50:41,535
Ted Nugent

889
00:50:42,047 --> 00:50:44,351
He put up the nude signal on the past day

890
00:50:45,887 --> 00:50:52,031
There

891
00:50:52,287 --> 00:50:57,407
Call in about how I his show on the Sportsman Channel has been cancelled

892
00:50:57,663 --> 00:50:59,455
That's because everybody's afraid of guns

893
00:50:59,711 --> 00:51:01,759
He's got the best ratings ever

894
00:51:02,015 --> 00:51:03,295
And I don't think any of that

895
00:51:04,063 --> 00:51:07,391
I think it's just a convenient way for them to play victim about the 2nd Amendment

896
00:51:07,647 --> 00:51:08,927
Yeah and

897
00:51:09,183 --> 00:51:09,951
It's very boring

898
00:51:10,719 --> 00:51:11,487
So

899
00:51:11,743 --> 00:51:12,255
It's hard for them

900
00:51:15,327 --> 00:51:17,887
Also I would like to wonder what is

901
00:51:18,399 --> 00:51:19,935
Why was Alex saying that

902
00:51:20,191 --> 00:51:22,751
10 years ago the NRA was very bad

903
00:51:23,007 --> 00:51:24,543
And now it's very

904
00:51:24,799 --> 00:51:25,823
Stream about the 2nd

905
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:27,103
An amendment

906
00:51:27,359 --> 00:51:29,919
Gone into. Where they were

907
00:51:31,711 --> 00:51:34,015
Semi automatic

908
00:51:34,271 --> 00:51:35,039
Rick

909
00:51:35,295 --> 00:51:39,135
Maybe that's reasonable and because of these other people.

910
00:51:39,647 --> 00:51:40,159
These moric

911
00:51:40,415 --> 00:51:41,439
Stream gun group

912
00:51:41,695 --> 00:51:43,999
The NRA.

913
00:51:44,255 --> 00:51:45,023
Stream organization

914
00:51:45,279 --> 00:51:47,071
Dalek believes that gun

915
00:51:47,327 --> 00:51:48,863
People should be on the offense

916
00:51:49,631 --> 00:51:51,679
And actually he has an interview later on

917
00:51:51,935 --> 00:51:54,239
Hearing that sentence does not make me feel good

918
00:51:54,495 --> 00:51:57,055
Later on

919
00:51:58,079 --> 00:51:58,847
Problem with America

920
00:51:59,871 --> 00:52:02,687
Bellator is an interview with a guy who runs a like citizens

921
00:52:02,943 --> 00:52:03,455
For gun rights

922
00:52:03,711 --> 00:52:04,479
Organization

923
00:52:04,735 --> 00:52:06,527
That Ted Nugent was involved with

924
00:52:08,575 --> 00:52:09,343
Very false claims

925
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:11,135
Fold down the road

926
00:52:11,647 --> 00:52:12,927
On the 9th

927
00:52:13,183 --> 00:52:15,231
Alex said that they called Trump a punk

928
00:52:15,743 --> 00:52:16,255
Yeah

929
00:52:16,511 --> 00:52:17,535
Then on the 10th

930
00:52:24,191 --> 00:52:25,727
Alex

931
00:52:31,615 --> 00:52:37,759
What about the factory flip-flops on dump position

932
00:52:38,015 --> 00:52:42,623
There was a reason not to trust you

933
00:52:53,375 --> 00:52:55,935
The streets and people sign a petition

934
00:52:56,191 --> 00:52:59,263
Tabantha on Amazon

935
00:52:59,775 --> 00:53:01,311
Adit Barnes & Noble

936
00:53:01,567 --> 00:53:04,383
Mark Dice is the worst

937
00:53:08,479 --> 00:53:09,247
Decided leave me alone

938
00:53:09,759 --> 00:53:10,783
But then beyond

939
00:53:11,295 --> 00:53:11,807
Based on

940
00:53:12,063 --> 00:53:12,831
Free market

941
00:53:13,087 --> 00:53:15,647
Based on Alex Jones is libertarian beliefs

942
00:53:16,159 --> 00:53:17,695
You should be able to not tell the Bible

943
00:53:17,951 --> 00:53:24,095
Yeah if you can refuse service to a lady getting a haircut you'll be able to refuse

944
00:53:24,351 --> 00:53:30,495
I don't understand where the line between your belief and religious supremacism in Liberty

945
00:53:30,751 --> 00:53:33,311
Where is what is more important

946
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:35,615
Religious

947
00:53:35,871 --> 00:53:37,663
Your principles your phony ass Principe

948
00:53:38,431 --> 00:53:39,455
It's insane

949
00:53:39,711 --> 00:53:42,271
Almost gets into a fight up with a guy

950
00:53:44,319 --> 00:53:48,671
Because he's trying to ban the Bible

951
00:53:48,927 --> 00:53:54,047
Don't sell it on Amazon or at Barnes & Noble

952
00:53:55,583 --> 00:53:59,935
Got really mad why did they leave it in the f****** clip because

953
00:54:00,191 --> 00:54:02,495
The guy gets really mad at him and he's like

954
00:54:02,751 --> 00:54:04,031
I'm doing a hidden camera show

955
00:54:04,287 --> 00:54:06,335
We're trying to point out the people are stupid for signing day

956
00:54:06,591 --> 00:54:08,383
I don't believe you f*** off

957
00:54:08,895 --> 00:54:10,687
Heaven Mark Dice chases them down

958
00:54:10,943 --> 00:54:12,991
Isaac no man don't you get it

959
00:54:13,247 --> 00:54:14,527
A right over there

960
00:54:16,831 --> 00:54:20,159
Yeah that's really sad

961
00:54:20,415 --> 00:54:25,791
Alex Jones tell the story about harassing a lady at the hike-and-bike trail

962
00:54:26,559 --> 00:54:27,583
Which is the

963
00:54:27,839 --> 00:54:30,399
Not at better than elves are we are l

964
00:54:30,655 --> 00:54:36,799
I'm just giving you a run down the steps because like we can't possibly cover everything

965
00:54:37,055 --> 00:54:41,151
We've already spent an hour-and-a-half onto clip

966
00:54:41,407 --> 00:54:43,199
About

967
00:54:43,455 --> 00:54:47,807
I think I've made up even in his made-up story

968
00:54:48,063 --> 00:54:48,575
You still a dick

969
00:54:48,831 --> 00:54:51,647
What you doing at the hike in there all the time

970
00:54:51,903 --> 00:54:53,695
You taking his kids there all the time

971
00:54:53,951 --> 00:54:58,815
Stories about the hike-and-bike trail at least every third outfit

972
00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:04,191
Handsome handsome

973
00:55:04,447 --> 00:55:08,031
Will you tell me a story about the immigrants who were fishing and cooking the fish

974
00:55:08,287 --> 00:55:08,799
Outside

975
00:55:09,055 --> 00:55:13,663
Infection from

976
00:55:13,919 --> 00:55:14,687
From the hiking bikes

977
00:55:20,063 --> 00:55:22,879
But using it as an opportunity to sell

978
00:55:23,135 --> 00:55:24,159
Silver Bullet

979
00:55:24,415 --> 00:55:26,207
Is colloidal silver product

980
00:55:26,463 --> 00:55:32,607
This is an opportunity to sell silver bullet

981
00:55:32,863 --> 00:55:33,375
I'm halfway like

982
00:55:35,167 --> 00:55:37,215
Do you think werewolves are real

983
00:55:42,847 --> 00:55:45,919
Alex Jones has a lot of really bad stuff in the next couple days

984
00:55:46,175 --> 00:55:48,479
And here is one of those things

985
00:55:49,247 --> 00:55:49,759
I tell you

986
00:55:51,295 --> 00:55:52,575
You talking about

987
00:56:03,839 --> 00:56:05,631
It's not just a fetish

988
00:56:06,143 --> 00:56:08,959
To smear

989
00:56:18,431 --> 00:56:19,199
Your daughter

990
00:56:26,623 --> 00:56:28,671
The most degenerate their most

991
00:56:29,439 --> 00:56:33,791
A bunch of eighteen-year-old twenty-year-old troublemaker

992
00:56:41,727 --> 00:56:43,263
Bunch of Christians heads off

993
00:57:11,167 --> 00:57:17,311
Quarterback in Vermont

994
00:57:20,895 --> 00:57:27,039
Not local

995
00:57:31,903 --> 00:57:34,207
That's so close to a Dennis Miller

996
00:57:34,719 --> 00:57:37,023
Heretic Brewing is run by the way

997
00:57:37,279 --> 00:57:40,095
White House

998
00:57:40,863 --> 00:57:43,935
Okay

999
00:57:44,191 --> 00:57:48,799
Does the CIA not really over their overseas

1000
00:57:51,359 --> 00:57:52,127
I don't know

1001
00:57:53,919 --> 00:57:56,991
I guess couple stories that have come out of

1002
00:57:57,247 --> 00:57:58,783
People Young

1003
00:57:59,039 --> 00:57:59,807
White girls

1004
00:58:00,063 --> 00:58:00,831
Who's going to join

1005
00:58:01,087 --> 00:58:01,599
Isis

1006
00:58:01,855 --> 00:58:05,695
Yeah in the same way that there are a couple stories that have come out of

1007
00:58:05,951 --> 00:58:06,975
Young white dude

1008
00:58:07,231 --> 00:58:07,999
Sue gone over to

1009
00:58:08,255 --> 00:58:13,375
To join

1010
00:58:13,631 --> 00:58:14,143
The opposite

1011
00:58:14,399 --> 00:58:19,519
The actual Syrian resistance

1012
00:58:19,775 --> 00:58:25,919
Or they're even trying to come here

1013
00:58:30,271 --> 00:58:31,551
He takes like

1014
00:58:31,807 --> 00:58:32,319
Colonel

1015
00:58:32,575 --> 00:58:33,599
It feels like one or two

1016
00:58:33,855 --> 00:58:35,135
You stories that have come out

1017
00:58:36,159 --> 00:58:38,207
Embellishes it to be like 1,000

1018
00:58:38,463 --> 00:58:43,327
Of young white girls who just want to go get beat by a by a Muslim cuz that cool

1019
00:58:43,583 --> 00:58:46,143
Yeah maybe women just want it sewed

1020
00:58:52,543 --> 00:58:56,127
I can tell you this there's not

1021
00:58:56,383 --> 00:58:56,895
Definitely not

1022
00:58:57,151 --> 00:58:58,687
So

1023
00:58:58,943 --> 00:59:00,735
He's snoring that's bad

1024
00:59:00,991 --> 00:59:02,015
Your impulse

1025
00:59:02,271 --> 00:59:03,295
Both bad

1026
00:59:03,551 --> 00:59:06,111
What is nothing on this next one

1027
00:59:06,879 --> 00:59:12,255
This is the first of two very severe historical misrepresentation that Alex make

1028
00:59:12,511 --> 00:59:14,047
It will discuss on Today Show

1029
00:59:14,303 --> 00:59:15,839
And I think it's probably the worst

1030
00:59:16,095 --> 00:59:17,119
So the two I'll let you decide

1031
00:59:17,375 --> 00:59:20,447
Because Hitler was a project of the Allegiant Air

1032
00:59:20,703 --> 00:59:23,775
I'm already out

1033
00:59:24,031 --> 00:59:26,335
But it's beyond what they tell you

1034
00:59:28,639 --> 00:59:29,919
Hillary's bad got it

1035
00:59:32,991 --> 00:59:34,271
Because

1036
00:59:34,527 --> 00:59:37,343
New York City

1037
00:59:38,367 --> 00:59:41,951
Get out

1038
00:59:50,399 --> 00:59:51,935
But after he was born

1039
00:59:53,727 --> 00:59:57,055
Because New York City wouldn't take him cuz the Jews shed

1040
00:59:57,311 --> 00:59:58,335
You didn't pay up

1041
00:59:59,359 --> 01:00:02,175
Shrew

1042
01:00:02,943 --> 01:00:06,527
If I was a real Nazi collaborator then it would be okay if I was George Soros

1043
01:00:06,783 --> 01:00:08,831
Schwarzenegger

1044
01:00:12,159 --> 01:00:14,207
Evil

1045
01:00:14,463 --> 01:00:15,487
I'll be right

1046
01:00:20,863 --> 01:00:24,703
Robinson and sucks off the Jews

1047
01:00:24,959 --> 01:00:26,751
Israel

1048
01:00:28,031 --> 01:00:31,359
Israel

1049
01:00:32,127 --> 01:00:36,479
$1000000 today

1050
01:00:37,247 --> 01:00:43,391
Middle class

1051
01:00:43,647 --> 01:00:46,207
Heaven Help Me

1052
01:00:46,719 --> 01:00:52,863
Holocaust narrative

1053
01:00:53,119 --> 01:00:59,263
The average amount

1054
01:00:59,519 --> 01:01:01,823
Truck stop

1055
01:01:11,295 --> 01:01:17,439
I feel your hand Nazi lovense come and go straight to hell where you came from

1056
01:01:17,695 --> 01:01:21,535
My friends it is official we can now say that Alex Jones is a holocaust denier

1057
01:01:22,047 --> 01:01:24,607
Wow

1058
01:01:26,143 --> 01:01:31,007
Wow that's pretty wild look into it there are a bunch

1059
01:01:34,079 --> 01:01:34,847
Get themselves out

1060
01:01:35,103 --> 01:01:41,247
Occupied York City out of camps

1061
01:01:41,503 --> 01:01:45,343
If you bribe a lot of money because

1062
01:01:45,599 --> 01:01:46,623
I want the money

1063
01:01:48,159 --> 01:01:50,463
Alex is extrapolating that to be like

1064
01:01:50,719 --> 01:01:51,487
So it was

1065
01:01:51,743 --> 01:01:54,559
It was Jewish groups who were keeping the poor Jews

1066
01:01:54,815 --> 01:01:58,399
In these camps to be killed

1067
01:02:02,495 --> 01:02:04,287
They plays on a

1068
01:02:04,543 --> 01:02:08,639
By their way out

1069
01:02:08,895 --> 01:02:11,711
And

1070
01:02:12,223 --> 01:02:14,271
America absolute

1071
01:02:15,039 --> 01:02:15,807
Do you know why

1072
01:02:16,063 --> 01:02:17,087
Because of the same

1073
01:02:17,343 --> 01:02:20,927
Walking type of people denying Muslim refugees

1074
01:02:21,183 --> 01:02:27,327
No that's why they're rewriting this goddamn history so they can't do it like

1075
01:02:27,583 --> 01:02:32,191
It wasn't us we're the ones who aren't f****** bringing it

1076
01:02:32,447 --> 01:02:38,591
If Alex has been around

1077
01:02:38,847 --> 01:02:41,919
Can be allowed

1078
01:02:42,943 --> 01:02:44,223
Their secret knock

1079
01:02:44,735 --> 01:02:47,551
What walking b*******

1080
01:02:47,807 --> 01:02:53,951
Sneak Nazis in America they play on your sympathies and then before you know it

1081
01:02:54,463 --> 01:02:56,767
They're making a little right

1082
01:02:57,023 --> 01:02:58,047
Play Pandora country

1083
01:02:58,303 --> 01:02:59,071
Even though

1084
01:02:59,327 --> 01:02:59,839
Very

1085
01:03:00,095 --> 01:03:03,423
F****** anti-semitic beliefs

1086
01:03:03,935 --> 01:03:05,727
Hitler

1087
01:03:06,239 --> 01:03:07,775
Intellectual here in the 19

1088
01:03:08,031 --> 01:03:08,799
Totally

1089
01:03:09,311 --> 01:03:15,455
Who f****** b******* in history to make

1090
01:03:15,711 --> 01:03:20,063
Like if you're if you're somebody now who says all lives matter

1091
01:03:20,575 --> 01:03:21,087
Doona

1092
01:03:21,343 --> 01:03:21,855
Do not

1093
01:03:22,111 --> 01:03:23,391
10 for a second

1094
01:03:23,647 --> 01:03:25,695
During the Civil Rights era

1095
01:03:25,951 --> 01:03:27,231
You would have been like well I

1096
01:03:27,743 --> 01:03:28,511
I get why

1097
01:03:28,767 --> 01:03:30,559
Martin Luther King Junior is angry

1098
01:03:30,815 --> 01:03:32,607
But I really don't like what he say

1099
01:03:33,119 --> 01:03:34,143
I'm I'm pulling on my

1100
01:03:35,167 --> 01:03:36,959
The neck of my shirt because the next

1101
01:03:37,215 --> 01:03:43,359
We're going to play it starts with him in the middle of a rant

1102
01:03:43,615 --> 01:03:45,407
It's about all lives matter

1103
01:03:48,991 --> 01:03:53,343
I want to just tell everybody in case you're unaware

1104
01:03:53,855 --> 01:03:57,951
The Holocaust denial is much more complicated than

1105
01:03:58,207 --> 01:03:59,999
Just someone saying it didn't happen

1106
01:04:00,255 --> 01:04:01,535
There's a lot of schools

1107
01:04:01,791 --> 01:04:02,559
The thought Within

1108
01:04:03,071 --> 01:04:04,607
The Holocaust denial community

1109
01:04:04,863 --> 01:04:06,911
They're people who believe like it didn't happen

1110
01:04:07,167 --> 01:04:08,191
But there were

1111
01:04:10,495 --> 01:04:12,799
But they were work camps they worked at camp

1112
01:04:13,055 --> 01:04:14,079
It didn't happen

1113
01:04:14,335 --> 01:04:19,711
But the reason the people died was because of malnutrition not because of a concerted effort on the

1114
01:04:19,967 --> 01:04:20,735
Unathi parts

1115
01:04:20,991 --> 01:04:21,503
To kill the Jews

1116
01:04:22,271 --> 01:04:24,831
The other another Branch that's just like

1117
01:04:25,087 --> 01:04:27,391
Hey yeah 6 million Jews.

1118
01:04:28,415 --> 01:04:30,719
A bunch of other people died so why do we care

1119
01:04:30,975 --> 01:04:32,767
There's all these branches end

1120
01:04:33,023 --> 01:04:33,535
The thing that Alex

1121
01:04:33,791 --> 01:04:34,815
Expressing

1122
01:04:35,327 --> 01:04:37,631
One of the branches of helicopter

1123
01:04:38,399 --> 01:04:39,167
This is

1124
01:04:39,423 --> 01:04:40,447
Incredibly

1125
01:04:40,959 --> 01:04:41,471
Disgusting

1126
01:04:41,983 --> 01:04:43,775
Certifit

1127
01:04:44,031 --> 01:04:45,567
This is the

1128
01:04:47,359 --> 01:04:48,383
Still pissed about that

1129
01:04:48,895 --> 01:04:49,663
After our last step

1130
01:04:50,943 --> 01:04:52,223
Is exactly the same s***

1131
01:04:52,735 --> 01:04:53,503
People try

1132
01:04:54,015 --> 01:04:56,063
With the alt-right versus

1133
01:04:56,319 --> 01:04:58,111
Light if you are

1134
01:04:58,367 --> 01:04:59,647
Minimizing the Holocaust

1135
01:05:00,159 --> 01:05:00,927
You are denying

1136
01:05:01,439 --> 01:05:04,511
You are not

1137
01:05:04,767 --> 01:05:05,279
You are not

1138
01:05:05,535 --> 01:05:06,815
Pretending to be

1139
01:05:07,071 --> 01:05:09,119
More intelligent

1140
01:05:09,375 --> 01:05:12,447
More research than anybody

1141
01:05:12,703 --> 01:05:14,495
Holocaust

1142
01:05:14,751 --> 01:05:18,847
Equivalent

1143
01:05:20,895 --> 01:05:23,455
Equivalent to somebody saying that it should

1144
01:05:23,967 --> 01:05:25,503
You're a f****** monster

1145
01:05:25,759 --> 01:05:30,879
On the head earlier and the reason

1146
01:05:32,927 --> 01:05:36,255
Engages in this sort of thing is that there's a part of him that realizes

1147
01:05:36,767 --> 01:05:38,559
That his mentality is

1148
01:05:39,327 --> 01:05:41,631
Was the problem in our country

1149
01:05:42,143 --> 01:05:44,703
Yeah

1150
01:05:44,959 --> 01:05:49,823
I was drunk does have a little thought about all lies matter but that's not the most important

1151
01:05:50,591 --> 01:05:52,127
You justice where he begins

1152
01:05:52,383 --> 01:05:54,431
Starting he's ranting about all lives matter

1153
01:05:54,687 --> 01:05:56,223
And how Democrats

1154
01:05:56,479 --> 01:05:57,247
Have to apologize

1155
01:05:57,503 --> 01:05:58,527
For saying all lives matter

1156
01:06:00,319 --> 01:06:04,159
But it leads to another really weird sort of religious

1157
01:06:04,671 --> 01:06:06,463
That I actually think is much more interest

1158
01:06:09,279 --> 01:06:10,047
Is a fraud

1159
01:06:13,887 --> 01:06:16,703
Sr raised

1160
01:06:24,895 --> 01:06:27,199
Machine

1161
01:06:27,967 --> 01:06:34,111
The devil isn't real for the sake of argument

1162
01:06:34,367 --> 01:06:38,975
Where is that Revelation that there's a telephone

1163
01:06:39,231 --> 01:06:39,743
I want to be clear

1164
01:06:39,999 --> 01:06:43,839
About before the truck started

1165
01:06:44,095 --> 01:06:50,239
I just came out that there's a telephone don't know what that

1166
01:06:50,495 --> 01:06:51,519
Talk about what

1167
01:06:52,031 --> 01:06:55,359
Oh you think the Rapture is

1168
01:06:55,615 --> 01:06:57,407
It's a f****** teleporter

1169
01:06:59,967 --> 01:07:01,247
Anyway.

1170
01:07:01,503 --> 01:07:02,527
Special

1171
01:07:06,623 --> 01:07:12,767
Fair

1172
01:07:14,559 --> 01:07:16,095
Deanne twittly. Preachers

1173
01:07:17,375 --> 01:07:18,655

1174
01:07:20,959 --> 01:07:23,775
501 c 3 script

1175
01:07:31,199 --> 01:07:37,343
Forever pots lines of that's great what I think is really fascinating is to look at like the preachers that he

1176
01:07:37,599 --> 01:07:38,367
He does have on

1177
01:07:40,671 --> 01:07:41,439
Complains about

1178
01:07:41,695 --> 01:07:45,791
Cuz he's had this guy named Pastor David James Manning's on

1179
01:07:46,047 --> 01:07:47,839
A bunch

1180
01:07:48,095 --> 01:07:51,167
David Manning is one of the craziest

1181
01:07:51,423 --> 01:07:52,703
Black nationalist

1182
01:07:53,215 --> 01:07:54,495
Homophobic pastors

1183
01:07:54,751 --> 01:07:58,847
Called Ministry in New York

1184
01:07:59,103 --> 01:08:01,919
The most notable thing he's done recently

1185
01:08:02,175 --> 01:08:04,735
Is a couple years back maybe a year-and-a-half ago or so

1186
01:08:04,991 --> 01:08:07,295
He came out and said that the gay agenda

1187
01:08:07,551 --> 01:08:08,319
Is way more

1188
01:08:08,575 --> 01:08:09,087
Then we think

1189
01:08:10,879 --> 01:08:13,183
Is that they're putting semen in the

1190
01:08:13,695 --> 01:08:14,975
At the Starbucks

1191
01:08:15,999 --> 01:08:22,143
The frothy milk

1192
01:08:27,263 --> 01:08:31,359
It's super fun because

1193
01:08:31,615 --> 01:08:34,175
You go into Starbucks when you get a latte it has semen

1194
01:08:34,687 --> 01:08:36,223
How many get a taste for semen

1195
01:08:36,479 --> 01:08:42,623
The gays like to eat a lot of fun so you'll associate these are these good times that you have

1196
01:08:45,439 --> 01:08:45,951

44 years talks for 2 years to do this

1227
01:10:29,119 --> 01:10:30,399
Finally

1228
01:10:30,655 --> 01:10:35,519
We got it all done I'll be honest with you I went out and talked to somebody

1229
01:10:35,775 --> 01:10:39,871
Just couldn't provide something as good as is

1230
01:10:40,127 --> 01:10:41,407
That was

1231
01:10:41,919 --> 01:10:48,063

I've moved on

1263
01:12:15,103 --> 01:12:18,687
So here is something

1264
01:12:18,943 --> 01:12:19,455
You know

1265
01:12:19,711 --> 01:12:22,015
Seeing 2000 people die

1266
01:12:22,271 --> 01:12:24,063
The half a million civilians that week

01:12:25,343 --> 01:12:26,111

01:12:27,647 --> 01:12:28,159
You know what

1269
01:12:30,463 --> 01:12:31,743

1273
01:12:45,567 --> 01:12:46,847
Levy Seaman dude

1274
01:12:47,103 --> 01:12:48,639
Very bad time

01:12:49,151 --> 01:12:51,455
This dude can't fart

1276
01:12:51,711 --> 01:12:52,223
Wait what

1277
01:12:52,479 --> 01:12:56,319
That sort of hit one of his arguments

1278
01:12:56,575 --> 01:12:57,599
Fart women around

1279
01:12:58,111 --> 01:12:59,391
That is legitimately

1280
01:12:59,647 --> 01:13:00,671
Like what is argena

1281
01:13:01,183 --> 01:13:02,463
Comes down to it but

1282
01:13:02,975 --> 01:13:03,999
More importantly

1283
01:13:04,255 --> 01:13:05,279
Alex has somebody

1284
01:13:05,535 --> 01:13:07,071
He needs you to be really afraid about

1285
01:13:07,327 --> 01:13:08,351
911

1286
01:13:08,607 --> 01:13:09,375
Here is that

1287
01:13:11,423 --> 01:13:16,287
Islam mesom

1288
01:13:17,823 --> 01:13:18,335
That's not

1289
01:13:18,591 --> 01:13:22,175
The New World Order

1290
01:13:22,687 --> 01:13:23,711
In Saudi Arabia

1291
01:13:23,967 --> 01:13:25,503
You understand that

1292
01:13:40,863 --> 01:13:42,911
Right now

1293
01:13:45,983 --> 01:13:49,311

1296
01:14:04,927 --> 01:14:08,767
That's the one

1297
01:14:10,559 --> 01:14:14,143
One of our governors

1298
01:14:14,655 --> 01:14:17,215
Even our even our best Governors have committed at least

1299
01:14:17,471 --> 01:14:17,983
Most crime

1300
01:14:18,239 --> 01:14:19,775
Light crimes

1301
01:14:20,031 --> 01:14:22,847
But that

1302
01:14:23,359 --> 01:14:26,175
False flag

1303
01:14:26,687 --> 01:14:31,551
They're going to overthrow the Middle East

1304
01:14:31,807 --> 01:14:32,575
Anyway

1305
01:14:37,439 --> 01:14:38,207

01:14:43,071 --> 01:14:43,839
What time right now

1308
01:14:46,911 --> 01:14:53,055

I know so much more that I have because I can't reveal sources

1312
01:15:11,743 --> 01:15:14,559
You have so many times

1313
01:15:16,351 --> 01:15:19,423
If they're looking at a whole bunch of arrest

1314
01:15:19,679 --> 01:15:21,983
Legislators

And the world

1319
01:15:47,327 --> 01:15:49,887
Getting locked in prison or killed

If it now

1328
01:16:17,535 --> 01:16:19,583
It's entirely possible that we don't make

1329
01:16:19,839 --> 01:16:20,351
Get through

1330
01:16:20,863 --> 01:16:22,399
This whole section of

1331
01:16:22,655 --> 01:16:27,007
Of democracy

1332
01:16:27,263 --> 01:16:29,823
We've done it we've done a lot

1333
01:16:30,079 --> 01:16:32,895
They want to believe that

1334
01:16:33,151 --> 01:16:34,943
The grp agenda and the

1335
01:16:35,199 --> 01:16:36,735
Restrict voting rights and all that s***

1336
01:16:37,247 --> 01:16:40,063
It's not like our voting rights haven't been restricted before

1337
01:16:40,319 --> 01:16:42,111
Do I like a large

1338
01:16:42,367 --> 01:16:43,647
Women got the vote

1339
01:16:48,767 --> 01:16:50,815
If they don't pull it off perfect

1340
01:16:51,839 --> 01:16:53,119
Sooner or later

1341
01:16:53,375 --> 01:16:54,143
Come after that

1342
01:16:54,655 --> 01:16:55,167
Right

1343
01:16:58,239 --> 01:16:58,751
Wind

1344
01:17:00,031 --> 01:17:00,543
A hundred percent

1345
01:17:02,079 --> 01:17:03,359
Sooner or later

1346
01:17:03,615 --> 01:17:04,127
They're going to get

1347
01:17:04,383 --> 01:17:05,919
And they don't understand

1348
01:17:06,175 --> 01:17:08,223
No but we're not saying

1349
01:17:10,271 --> 01:17:12,575
Fucken are we

1350
01:17:12,831 --> 01:17:18,975
Now you're down

1351
01:17:27,167 --> 01:17:29,215
Video of the place we're doing stop Jones

1352
01:17:29,471 --> 01:17:34,335
Governors are legislators

1353
01:17:36,127 --> 01:17:37,919
What kind of lunacy Whitaker

1354
01:17:38,943 --> 01:17:39,455
If you

1355
01:17:40,223 --> 01:17:43,551
Little bit off

1356
01:17:43,807 --> 01:17:49,951
It's not the wine Jordan is watching the baseball game on this phone

1357
01:17:50,207 --> 01:17:54,303
I'm just keeping

1358
01:17:56,863 --> 01:17:57,887
I understand your fam

1359
01:17:58,655 --> 01:17:59,423
Iuic

1360
01:17:59,679 --> 01:18:02,239
Angry about that

1361
01:18:02,495 --> 01:18:03,007
Ascend

1362
01:18:03,263 --> 01:18:07,871
If you just said it was are you sure are you sure it's not because

1363
01:18:08,127 --> 01:18:08,639
Nevermind

1364
01:18:12,479 --> 01:18:13,759
So on September 11th

1365
01:18:14,271 --> 01:18:18,111
That was one of the

1366
01:18:18,367 --> 01:18:22,207
The idea that has high-level sources

1367
01:18:22,719 --> 01:18:25,535
All of our Patriots take him out secretly

1368
01:18:28,607 --> 01:18:30,911
He also has an interview with a guy named Joseph

1369
01:18:31,167 --> 01:18:31,679
Farrah

1370
01:18:31,935 --> 01:18:32,703
Be aware of

1371
01:18:32,959 --> 01:18:33,471
Sferra

1372
01:18:33,727 --> 01:18:35,007
I'm not never heard of that

1373
01:18:35,519 --> 01:18:37,567
WorldNetDaily

1374
01:18:38,079 --> 01:18:39,871
He is a dick

1375
01:18:40,127 --> 01:18:40,895
Yeah

1376
01:18:41,407 --> 01:18:43,967
I was going to say you you said WorldNetDaily and

1377
01:18:44,479 --> 01:18:44,991
Betty's

1378
01:18:46,015 --> 01:18:46,527
Horrifying

1379
01:18:47,295 --> 01:18:49,599
He is big into the Clinton

1380
01:18:49,855 --> 01:18:51,903
Conspiracies along with our friend Larry Nichols

1381
01:18:52,415 --> 01:18:55,487
And then also he

1382
01:18:55,743 --> 01:18:57,535
I've made a lot of

1383
01:18:57,791 --> 01:18:58,559
Public claim

1384
01:18:59,071 --> 01:18:59,839
Butta bomma

1385
01:19:00,095 --> 01:19:01,119
His birth certificate is fake

1386
01:19:01,375 --> 01:19:05,215
He offered to pay up $15,000 if they could prove it was real

1387
01:19:05,471 --> 01:19:08,543
I meant reneged once the birth certificate was revealed

1388
01:19:10,079 --> 01:19:10,847
Easy easy

1389
01:19:11,359 --> 01:19:12,383
But he

1390
01:19:13,407 --> 01:19:14,175
He released

1391
01:19:14,431 --> 01:19:16,223
Some information about the clintons

1392
01:19:18,015 --> 01:19:19,039
Empath

1393
01:19:19,295 --> 01:19:20,575
About how they wanted to

1394
01:19:20,831 --> 01:19:21,343
Silent

1395
01:19:21,599 --> 01:19:22,367
Conservative voices

1396
01:19:23,391 --> 01:19:26,463
Interview about

1397
01:19:26,719 --> 01:19:28,255
You know the growing Clinton Menace

1398
01:19:28,767 --> 01:19:29,279
In the 20s

1399
01:19:29,535 --> 01:19:30,303
16 election

1400
01:19:30,559 --> 01:19:31,583
And he asked

1401
01:19:31,839 --> 01:19:32,607
Joseph Farah

1402
01:19:33,887 --> 01:19:35,423
Hey you got a bunch of information

1403
01:19:35,679 --> 01:19:36,703
Why don't you release it

1404
01:19:37,471 --> 01:19:38,239
Will you have a bunch

1405
01:19:38,495 --> 01:19:40,031
The stuff from the Clinton stash

1406
01:19:40,287 --> 01:19:40,799
Do you have

1407
01:19:41,055 --> 01:19:43,103
Now

1408
01:19:43,359 --> 01:19:45,663
Let's see how legitimate his answer is

1409
01:19:56,927 --> 01:19:59,743
About what

1410
01:19:59,999 --> 01:20:00,767
Bombshell

1411
01:20:01,535 --> 01:20:07,679
Yeah well it is near but you know when I look at it just means something to me because I

1412
01:20:10,239 --> 01:20:16,384
How much do I put out there without

1413
01:20:16,640 --> 01:20:20,736
This Is How They

1414
01:20:30,976 --> 01:20:37,120
Such an early stage

1415
01:20:39,936 --> 01:20:41,984
Breitbart androgynous

1416
01:20:49,408 --> 01:20:55,552
And a bunch of

1417
01:20:55,808 --> 01:20:58,880
Want to release because people think I'm being sentimental ornithology

1418
01:20:59,136 --> 01:21:03,744
What is Delphine

1419
01:21:04,256 --> 01:21:07,840
Okay I don't want to look like I'm just all

1420
01:21:08,096 --> 01:21:09,376
What that means

1421
01:21:09,632 --> 01:21:11,424
I think if I was going to

1422
01:21:11,680 --> 01:21:12,192
To try and

1423
01:21:12,448 --> 01:21:12,960
Give him a tie

1424
01:21:13,216 --> 01:21:17,568
I would say that means is people think I'm trying to sell

1425
01:21:18,080 --> 01:21:20,128
I'll try to make myself the story about the

1426
01:21:21,408 --> 01:21:22,432
And I want to avoid that

1427
01:21:22,688 --> 01:21:24,736
Hey Tim try to be magnanimous in Humble

1428
01:21:24,992 --> 01:21:26,528
But the reality is he

1429
01:21:27,040 --> 01:21:28,064
Give no information

1430
01:21:28,832 --> 01:21:30,880
Obviously you're the f****** guy who runs

1431
01:21:31,136 --> 01:21:32,416
Started World News

1432
01:21:32,672 --> 01:21:33,696
WorldNetDaily

1433
01:21:33,952 --> 01:21:35,488
You're on Alex Jones Show talk

1434
01:21:35,744 --> 01:21:36,512
Shut about the Clinton

1435
01:21:36,768 --> 01:21:38,560
If you have any concrete information

1436
01:21:38,816 --> 01:21:42,144
You told me that mother f****** s*** up

1437
01:21:42,400 --> 01:21:44,192
Concrete information

1438
01:21:44,448 --> 01:21:44,960
Makes

1439
01:21:45,216 --> 01:21:48,288
You just want

1440
01:21:48,544 --> 01:21:50,592
You want to have this

1441
01:21:50,848 --> 01:21:53,664
Possible thing right

1442
01:21:54,176 --> 01:21:59,296
Because it's the same thing with W on the server

1443
01:21:59,552 --> 01:22:00,832
Creates in your mind is

1444
01:22:01,088 --> 01:22:03,136
Way more potent than what the reality is

1445
01:22:03,392 --> 01:22:04,416
It's the same reason like

1446
01:22:04,672 --> 01:22:06,208
I've been putting out these

1447
01:22:06,464 --> 01:22:09,536
I made an archive of the episodes of that they wanted

1448
01:22:10,048 --> 01:22:10,560
Me and Marty

1449
01:22:10,816 --> 01:22:11,584
Conspiracy theories

1450
01:22:11,840 --> 01:22:13,120
And we did what

1451
01:22:13,376 --> 01:22:16,704
Thanks we didn't want episode about a group called The hellfire club

1452
01:22:16,960 --> 01:22:21,312
Secret society that existed

1453
01:22:21,568 --> 01:22:22,336
Guy names for France

1454
01:22:22,592 --> 01:22:23,104
Dashwood

1455
01:22:24,384 --> 01:22:24,896
As love their names

1456
01:22:28,992 --> 01:22:32,576
Secret society

1457
01:22:39,232 --> 01:22:40,256
Self-esteem

1458
01:22:41,024 --> 01:22:43,840
Sodomy was involved

1459
01:22:44,352 --> 01:22:45,888
But they had

1460
01:22:46,912 --> 01:22:47,936
They created

1461
01:22:48,192 --> 01:22:48,704
Secrecy

1462
01:22:48,960 --> 01:22:49,472
Intentionally

1463
01:22:51,520 --> 01:22:53,056
This methodology

1464
01:22:53,568 --> 01:22:57,408
Wherein they would publicly talked about how secret their society

1465
01:22:57,920 --> 01:22:59,200
And because they would do that

1466
01:22:59,456 --> 01:23:00,992
There was a mistake to what they did

1467
01:23:01,248 --> 01:23:03,296
Way more important

1468
01:23:03,552 --> 01:23:04,832
They were actually doing

1469
01:23:08,160 --> 01:23:09,184
Perhaps but it wasn't

1470
01:23:09,440 --> 01:23:10,720
To any larger goal

1471
01:23:10,976 --> 01:23:12,000
But because

1472
01:23:12,256 --> 01:23:14,560
They would be like like Acme

1473
01:23:14,816 --> 01:23:15,840
About the hellfire club

1474
01:23:17,888 --> 01:23:20,448
Have you been to the house and I haven't

1475
01:23:20,704 --> 01:23:26,592
They're really upset

1476
01:23:28,128 --> 01:23:28,896
I have no idea

1477
01:23:29,152 --> 01:23:30,688
I've heard stuff

1478
01:23:31,200 --> 01:23:32,736
Table

1479
01:23:32,992 --> 01:23:39,136
Did he stop Red Rock workout

1480
01:23:39,392 --> 01:23:45,536
No tomorrow

1481
01:23:45,792 --> 01:23:50,656
I don't want to because you're mine

1482
01:23:53,216 --> 01:23:55,008
He's not putting it up maybe it's dangerous

1483
01:23:57,056 --> 01:23:57,824
Representation of

1484
01:23:59,360 --> 01:24:02,176
In one of his I think it was The Long Dark

1485
01:24:02,432 --> 01:24:03,200
Tea-time of the Soul

1486
01:24:03,712 --> 01:24:05,504
He had a famous author

1487
01:24:06,016 --> 01:24:07,552
Who famously

1488
01:24:09,088 --> 01:24:09,600
Taken

1489
01:24:09,856 --> 01:24:10,624
Into his hotel room

1490
01:24:11,904 --> 01:24:12,416
Nobody knows

1491
01:24:12,928 --> 01:24:14,720
And then later on is

1492
01:24:15,488 --> 01:24:21,632
We are you just hadn't brought it and had him smuggle that with nobody knowing because it created that sense of what the f***

1493
01:24:22,912 --> 01:24:27,008
Like so many weird celebrities

1494
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:31,872
It's unfortunately way more.

1495
01:24:32,640 --> 01:24:33,152
Create

1496
01:24:33,408 --> 01:24:34,688
Is part of that

1497
01:24:34,944 --> 01:24:35,712
Vast right-wing

1498
01:24:35,968 --> 01:24:39,808
Conspiracy that Hillary Clinton so accurately complained about

1499
01:24:46,208 --> 01:24:48,256
And let's be clear we're not

1500
01:24:48,768 --> 01:24:49,536
Sitting here saying that

1501
01:24:51,840 --> 01:24:53,888
That's not our game that's like

1502
01:24:54,400 --> 01:24:54,912
I'd like

1503
01:24:55,936 --> 01:24:57,472
The thing I think about

1504
01:24:57,984 --> 01:24:59,520
Whenever we talk about the

1505
01:25:01,312 --> 01:25:02,592
A lot of what's going on with

1506
01:25:02,848 --> 01:25:03,360
Emmanuel

1507
01:25:03,616 --> 01:25:04,128
Omicron

1508
01:25:04,384 --> 01:25:04,896
Right now in

1509
01:25:06,432 --> 01:25:07,456
He's way better

1510
01:25:08,224 --> 01:25:09,760
Then what

1511
01:25:10,016 --> 01:25:10,784
Then leave

1512
01:25:13,600 --> 01:25:19,232
The king like he's not good he he sucks in a lot of ways but

1513
01:25:23,584 --> 01:25:25,632
It seems like our world now exist

1514
01:25:25,888 --> 01:25:26,400
In

1515
01:25:27,168 --> 01:25:29,728
The extreme far-right

1516
01:25:30,240 --> 01:25:33,568

How about Progressive

1519
01:25:39,968 --> 01:25:41,760
This is a thing that I thought about

1520
01:25:42,016 --> 01:25:44,320
Which is

1521
01:25:44,832 --> 01:25:46,368
The way that a lot of

1522
01:25:46,624 --> 01:25:47,392
Conservative

1523
01:25:47,648 --> 01:25:49,184
Before the Tea Party really got going

1524
01:25:49,440 --> 01:25:50,464
Is that like a

1525
01:25:50,720 --> 01:25:52,000
The center was liberal

1526
01:25:52,256 --> 01:25:53,024
MMA

1527
01:25:53,536 --> 01:25:54,048
You know what I'm saying

1528
01:25:54,304 --> 01:25:56,864
What's the Republicans will come

1529
01:25:57,120 --> 01:25:59,424
Hey man that Democrats were straight up socialist

1530
01:25:59,680 --> 01:26:00,704
Yeah

1531
01:26:00,960 --> 01:26:03,008
Launch this hard right thing

1532
01:26:03,264 --> 01:26:05,056
And they have moved it

1533
01:26:05,312 --> 01:26:06,336
Super Fart the right

1534
01:26:06,848 --> 01:26:07,360
And maybe

1535
01:26:07,616 --> 01:26:08,128
I don't know

1536
01:26:08,384 --> 01:26:12,736
I don't know how I feel entirely about the blossoming internet socialism

1537
01:26:13,248 --> 01:26:18,624
That's been going on look into it a little more before I before I speak on it

1538
01:26:18,880 --> 01:26:22,464
Yeah but it's possible that sort of

1539
01:26:22,720 --> 01:26:23,744
New version

1540
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:25,536
On the list of the Tea Party

1541
01:26:25,792 --> 01:26:27,328
And swing thing back

1542
01:26:27,584 --> 01:26:29,376
But unfortunately

1543
01:26:29,632 --> 01:26:33,472
It will swing the other way

1544
01:26:40,384 --> 01:26:41,664
For every action there is any

1545
01:26:42,688 --> 01:26:43,200
Yeah

1546
01:26:44,480 --> 01:26:45,248

This next clip from Alex

1550
01:26:55,744 --> 01:26:58,048
Is one of the most misogynist

1551
01:26:58,304 --> 01:27:00,864
Never had to say and that's saying a lot

1552
01:27:01,888 --> 01:27:05,216
Illustrate how serious this year

1553
01:27:19,040 --> 01:27:20,064

1559
01:27:33,888 --> 01:27:36,448

1560
01:27:36,704 --> 01:27:41,312

01:27:41,568 --> 01:27:47,712
Professional networking site why do not want to be judged by my appearance

1562
01:27:51,040 --> 01:27:52,832
Everyone started calling her

1563
01:27:53,088 --> 01:27:54,112
She started

1564
01:27:54,368 --> 01:27:55,904
Threats

1565
01:27:56,160 --> 01:27:57,184
Over social media

1566
01:27:57,440 --> 01:27:59,488
She was inundated with

1567
01:27:59,744 --> 01:28:00,512
So much abuse

1568
01:28:00,768 --> 01:28:04,608
From standing up for yourself I read the messages

1569
01:28:05,120 --> 01:28:05,888
That were sent

1570
01:28:06,144 --> 01:28:08,960
Are there post that you can read this Guardian article about it

1571
01:28:09,216 --> 01:28:15,360
I don't think she said anything that was like Hey fuk you man right

01:28:15,616 --> 01:28:16,384

1573
01:28:16,896 --> 01:28:17,664

1576
01:28:23,552 --> 01:28:24,576

1577
01:28:24,832 --> 01:28:26,112

01:28:37,376 --> 01:28:38,400
Afterwards came up to

1582
01:28:39,424 --> 01:28:42,752
Man whatever you pulled out that violin you were so sexy

1583
01:28:43,776 --> 01:28:45,568
There are compliments about

1584
01:28:45,824 --> 01:28:46,848
Comedy

1585
01:28:47,104 --> 01:28:47,616
You don't need

1586
01:28:47,872 --> 01:28:48,640
What's that

1587
01:28:48,896 --> 01:28:52,480
F*** is that it's very weird and the reason that like

1588
01:28:52,736 --> 01:28:55,040
You were very funny

1589
01:28:55,296 --> 01:28:56,064

You know the conversation has been having a lot of dudes aren't listening to

1593
01:29:06,816 --> 01:29:10,400
Is that the sexualizing and eroticize and compliments

1594
01:29:10,912 --> 01:29:13,728
Especially in non-romantic text

1595
01:29:13,984 --> 01:29:16,800
What it does is a of exerting power over with

1596
01:29:19,872 --> 01:29:20,640
See you there

1597
01:29:20,896 --> 01:29:22,176

Check me out at Dillard's or something

1617
01:31:13,280 --> 01:31:16,352
This is sick

1618
01:31:19,680 --> 01:31:25,824
But it's all selectively enforced if you want to have liberal Hollywood

1619
01:31:36,576 --> 01:31:37,088
Nope

1620
01:31:38,368 --> 01:31:40,160

1623
01:31:50,400 --> 01:31:53,472
Before then I'm so sorry it's slightly correct

1624
01:31:53,984 --> 01:31:56,288
Incorrect

1625
01:31:56,544 --> 01:31:58,336
Bug-eyed piranha

1626
01:31:59,872 --> 01:32:01,408
To come in and go after him

1627
01:32:03,456 --> 01:32:06,016

01:32:34,688 --> 01:32:35,200
Holy

1630

That and is

1632
01:32:37,504 --> 01:32:38,016
Crazy

1633
01:32:38,528 --> 01:32:39,552
If you get jumped

1634
01:32:39,808 --> 01:32:45,952

01:32:48,256 --> 01:32:49,024
On LinkedIn

1636
01:32:50,048 --> 01:32:52,096
That's so f****** awful

1637
01:32:52,608 --> 01:32:54,400
That interpretation is wild

1638
01:32:54,656 --> 01:32:55,168
I don't

1639
01:32:55,680 --> 01:32:57,216
How can you not understand that

1640
01:32:59,264 --> 01:32:59,776
The context of a

1641
01:33:00,288 --> 01:33:00,800
Look

1642
01:33:01,056 --> 01:33:02,080
I want to fuc

1643
01:33:02,592 --> 01:33:07,712
Yeah but that's not why I would hire someone on LinkedIn

1644
01:33:07,968 --> 01:33:13,600

01:33:14,112 --> 01:33:14,624
Rate

1646
01:33:14,880 --> 01:33:16,672
So long as you're not being a creep

1647
01:33:16,928 --> 01:33:23,072
Yeah you're not pulling them off the streets or within a context that makes

1648
01:33:23,328 --> 01:33:29,472
Sent threatening

1649
01:33:29,728 --> 01:33:31,520
Do that in a professional Circle

Wild

1651
01:33:33,568 --> 01:33:34,592
Bizarre

1652
01:33:35,616 --> 01:33:39,200
Also the reason he thinks he's an actor

1653
01:33:39,456 --> 01:33:44,320
Critique her and call her like a wild out-of-control feminazi blah blah blah

1654
01:33:44,576 --> 01:33:50,720
Is that you said that she called men sexy and hot stuff online

1655
01:33:50,976 --> 01:33:51,744
That's exactly

1656
01:33:53,536 --> 01:33:55,072
If you look into that

1657
01:33:55,328 --> 01:33:56,352
Yeah

1658
01:33:57,376 --> 01:33:58,144
She commented

1659
01:33:58,400 --> 01:33:58,912
Sexy

1660
01:33:59,168 --> 01:34:00,192

01:34:00,448 --> 01:34:01,728

1662
01:34:01,984 --> 01:34:03,776
F****** which is completely different

1663
01:34:04,032 --> 01:34:04,544
Very

1664
01:34:04,800 --> 01:34:06,336
Very different

1665
01:34:06,592 --> 01:34:08,896
Congratulatory

1666
01:34:09,152 --> 01:34:10,176
He knows that

1667
01:34:10,688 --> 01:34:11,712
People aren't

1668
01:34:11,968 --> 01:34:14,272
Knows that his audience

1669
01:34:14,528 --> 01:34:15,808
Duties anti-feminist

1670
01:34:17,600 --> 01:34:20,160
Mentality

1671
01:34:21,696 --> 01:34:22,464
That's like this

1672
01:34:22,720 --> 01:34:26,560
Just like whenever they show the the little headline

1673
01:34:27,072 --> 01:34:27,840
Stuff like that

1674
01:34:28,352 --> 01:34:29,120
Where it's like

1675
01:34:32,192 --> 01:34:32,704
Convict

1676
01:34:34,240 --> 01:34:35,264
Murdered by the cops

1677
01:34:35,776 --> 01:34:36,288
Yeah

1678
01:34:36,800 --> 01:34:40,640
Father-of-two

1679
01:34:40,896 --> 01:34:47,040
Father-of-three either words

1680
01:34:47,296 --> 01:34:51,904
Yeah pulled someone out of a burning car

1681
01:34:52,160 --> 01:34:52,672
Spelling

1682
01:34:52,928 --> 01:34:57,024
Saved

1683
01:35:04,192 --> 01:35:08,032
Former actress

1684
01:35:09,312 --> 01:35:11,104
So

1685
01:35:11,360 --> 01:35:12,128
F******

1686
01:35:12,384 --> 01:35:13,408
Unbelievable

1687
01:35:13,920 --> 01:35:14,688
Or just

1688
01:35:14,944 --> 01:35:17,248
Just the way that the white lady shot

1689
01:35:18,016 --> 01:35:20,064
The Australian white ladies

1690
01:35:21,344 --> 01:35:24,928
So differently

1691
01:35:28,256 --> 01:35:29,024
Yeah I'm over it

1692
01:35:29,280 --> 01:35:33,120
F****** believe it's so tragic

1693
01:35:35,424 --> 01:35:36,192
Now what are

1694
01:35:37,984 --> 01:35:40,544
Like the actual elements of it are farts

1695
01:35:41,056 --> 01:35:44,384
But that's kind of where we leave off September 11th

1696
01:35:44,640 --> 01:35:45,408
2015

1697
01:35:48,224 --> 01:35:52,064
Really is an interview with our favorite homophobic Pastor Chuck Baldwin

1698
01:35:52,320 --> 01:35:55,392
Here's the guy who said that no civilization that has

1699
01:35:55,648 --> 01:36:01,792
Officially endorsed homosexuality has ever survived

1700
01:36:02,048 --> 01:36:04,864
Christianity is responsible for saving

1701
01:36:05,120 --> 01:36:07,424
People from slavery all sorts of

1702
01:36:07,680 --> 01:36:11,776
Everything is good

1703
01:36:12,032 --> 01:36:15,872
Even when Christians did bad stuff well that's cuz they weren't Christians

1704
01:36:17,664 --> 01:36:18,688
The 11th

1705
01:36:18,944 --> 01:36:19,968
And then almost as if

1706
01:36:20,224 --> 01:36:22,016
Regardless of your religion people are

1707
01:36:22,272 --> 01:36:23,040
Capable of doing good

1708
01:36:23,552 --> 01:36:25,344
So the 11th is a Friday

1709
01:36:25,856 --> 01:36:27,136
Over the weekend

1710
01:36:27,392 --> 01:36:29,184
Bike trail

1711
01:36:29,440 --> 01:36:30,208
And jumps into Lake

1712
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:34,560
He's gone on Sunday David night host

1713
01:36:34,816 --> 01:36:35,328
On 13th

1714
01:36:35,584 --> 01:36:37,120
I host again on the 14th

1715
01:36:37,376 --> 01:36:38,912
Yeah

1716
01:36:39,168 --> 01:36:40,448
And we get back to the 15

1717
01:36:40,704 --> 01:36:42,496
And it's weird cuz the end of the 11th

1718
01:36:46,336 --> 01:36:47,616
And he comes back

1719
01:36:47,872 --> 01:36:48,640
On the 15th

1720
01:36:49,152 --> 01:36:50,944
And he wants to talk a whole bunch

1721
01:36:51,200 --> 01:36:51,968
About West

1722
01:36:53,760 --> 01:36:57,344
But instead of religion

1723
01:36:57,856 --> 01:36:58,368
It's based

1724
01:36:58,624 --> 01:36:59,392
In

1725
01:37:01,440 --> 01:37:02,464
I would posit

1726
01:37:02,720 --> 01:37:04,512
He does not have a good handle on his

1727
01:37:05,024 --> 01:37:06,816
But we can discuss that on the app

1728
01:37:07,328 --> 01:37:10,400
Did we just discover that now we can discuss that on the other end of the

1729
01:37:26,016 --> 01:37:27,040
It's just not true

1730
01:37:30,368 --> 01:37:32,160
And why the West is great

1731
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:41,120
White or batteries other things for whatever manifestation

1732
01:37:42,912 --> 01:37:46,240
Different breeds of dogs

1733
01:37:46,496 --> 01:37:47,520
Why dogs are better

1734
01:37:53,152 --> 01:37:54,176
Has been the great innovator

1735
01:37:55,712 --> 01:37:57,760
Builders the Great

1736
01:37:58,784 --> 01:38:02,880
Much of the ideas the last fireworks

1737
01:38:03,392 --> 01:38:04,672
17 lb

1738
01:38:06,464 --> 01:38:08,512
Come from even older cultures

1739
01:38:09,024 --> 01:38:12,864
But whatever reason many of those cultures fell before

1740
01:38:13,120 --> 01:38:15,168
And never Rose

1741
01:38:15,680 --> 01:38:16,448
Emma

1742

1743
01:38:19,008 --> 01:38:20,800
Four great innovators

1744
01:38:21,056 --> 01:38:26,432
In other cultures and using it when other cultures

1745
01:38:31,808 --> 01:38:32,576
I don't know what that mean

1746
01:38:34,624 --> 01:38:36,160
And that was the last

1747
01:38:36,416 --> 01:38:38,976
What is The Melting Pot

1748
01:38:41,280 --> 01:38:43,584
Racist

1749
01:38:44,608 --> 01:38:47,936
And your father

1750
01:38:50,240 --> 01:38:53,568
Sure

1751
01:38:54,080 --> 01:38:55,616
The first is

1752
01:38:56,640 --> 01:39:01,248
Where do where do we start with his b******* and work backwards

1753
01:39:01,504 --> 01:39:03,296

01:39:31,200 --> 01:39:33,248
Is that Barbarian

1763
01:39:33,504 --> 01:39:34,272
You know where it comes from

1764
01:39:34,528 --> 01:39:36,064

Because they thought that everybody who didn't even immigrants

01:39:55,008 --> 01:39:55,776
Actual people

1770
01:39:57,824 --> 01:39:58,336
They would

1771
01:39:58,848 --> 01:40:01,152
Barbarian comes from barbar

1772
01:40:03,712 --> 01:40:09,856
They didn't respect anyone else's language or any culture

1773
01:40:10,112 --> 01:40:12,416
Onomatopoeia

01:40:12,672 --> 01:40:15,232
Okay come from

1775
01:40:15,488 --> 01:40:16,256

1776
01:40:16,512 --> 01:40:21,888
There's tons of stuff throughout the history of Greece and terrible

1777
01:40:22,144 --> 01:40:24,960
Father a culture and civilization

1778
01:40:25,216 --> 01:40:26,752
The idea

1779
01:40:27,008 --> 01:40:33,152
Well it's like this great innovator that took things from other cultures have been made it better

1780

Take the big Kill Everybody

1781
01:40:43,904 --> 01:40:50,048
The idea that the West is the great innovators have pulled

Everybody mix

1863
01:44:47,872 --> 01:44:49,920
That's where things got a lot better

1864
01:44:50,176 --> 01:44:50,944
And a lot more interest

1865
01:44:52,224 --> 01:44:54,272
Yeah everywhere

01:44:54,784 --> 01:44:55,808
Everywhere

1867
01:44:56,064 --> 01:44:58,624
Like when you're when you're talking about

1868
01:44:59,392 --> 01:45:01,184

Most people today

1874
01:45:12,448 --> 01:45:13,984
They are so isolated

1875
01:45:14,240 --> 01:45:15,264
Did that they never

1876
01:45:15,520 --> 01:45:17,568
Wind-up interacting

1877
01:45:17,824 --> 01:45:21,408

From far-off lands

1880
01:45:30,624 --> 01:45:32,416
In order to

1881
01:45:36,768 --> 01:45:39,072
The idea of isolation

1882
01:45:39,328 --> 01:45:40,352
The idea of

1883
01:45:40,864 --> 01:45:41,632

Exactly

1886
01:45:47,520 --> 01:45:51,104
If you want great work if you want the world to die

01:45:51,360 --> 01:45:52,128
Nationalism

01:45:52,384 --> 01:45:52,896
The way you do

01:45:58,528 --> 01:45:59,808
He's wrong about most of them as

1890
01:46:00,320 --> 01:46:01,344
Discussed but

1891
01:46:02,880 --> 01:46:04,928
This next clip is super bizarre

1892
01:46:06,208 --> 01:46:06,720
We

1893
01:46:06,976 --> 01:46:08,768
No Alex Jones as a man

1894
01:46:09,024 --> 01:46:10,816
It was primarily against

1895
01:46:11,072 --> 01:46:11,584
Tyranny

1896
01:46:12,608 --> 01:46:13,632
He's afraid

1897
01:46:14,144 --> 01:46:15,680
Theoretically primarily

1898
01:46:16,448 --> 01:46:17,728
His words

1899
01:46:18,496 --> 01:46:19,008
Hugh

1900
01:46:19,520 --> 01:46:21,056
Sort of world conception

1901
01:46:21,312 --> 01:46:24,128
Liberals are not really liberals

1902
01:46:24,384 --> 01:46:25,664
They want to push socialism

1903
01:46:25,920 --> 01:46:27,200
Which will lead to Communism

1904
01:46:27,456 --> 01:46:30,272
To a totalitarian regime

1905
01:46:30,528 --> 01:46:32,064
Tyranny

1906
01:46:32,320 --> 01:46:32,832
His big

1907
01:46:33,088 --> 01:46:34,880
Kefir and how much

1908
01:46:35,136 --> 01:46:35,904
Fewer steps

1909
01:46:36,160 --> 01:46:36,672
It takes to get to

1910
01:46:41,536 --> 01:46:42,304
That is

1911
01:46:42,560 --> 01:46:43,584
His

1912
01:46:43,840 --> 01:46:44,864
His career now

1913
01:46:45,120 --> 01:46:45,632
Talked about

1914
01:46:45,888 --> 01:46:46,912
For the beginning of this episode

1915
01:46:47,168 --> 01:46:49,216
There's also that weird pseudo-spiritual

1916
01:46:49,472 --> 01:46:51,520
That's going on in the background

1917
01:46:51,776 --> 01:46:53,568
In terms of what he's really willing to

1918
01:46:53,824 --> 01:46:55,616
Present as his overarching theme

1919
01:46:55,872 --> 01:46:56,896
It's a fight against

1920
01:46:59,712 --> 01:47:00,224
Epsom salt

1921
01:47:00,480 --> 01:47:02,528
All the time

1922
01:47:02,784 --> 01:47:05,088
Is super f***** up when you keep that in mind

1923
01:47:06,368 --> 01:47:09,184
Do not want you to be perceptive

1924
01:47:09,440 --> 01:47:12,512
Powerful

1925
01:47:16,352 --> 01:47:17,632
And all I know is

1926
01:47:22,496 --> 01:47:28,384
Total control system Wars and functions killing each other

1927
01:47:28,640 --> 01:47:29,664
That's not good.

1928
01:47:40,160 --> 01:47:46,304
I would say it was a lesser of evils very dangerous might be coming down the road but I wouldn't fight

1929
01:47:51,936 --> 01:47:53,216
Does that mean

1930
01:47:53,728 --> 01:47:55,264
What you just said is

1931
01:47:55,520 --> 01:47:57,568
Is cool as long as it's on my side

1932
01:47:57,824 --> 01:48:01,152
As long as it's the right kind of tyranny as long as

1933
01:48:01,664 --> 01:48:03,456
That's incredibly f***** up

1934
01:48:03,712 --> 01:48:06,784
Like most of his beliefs

1935
01:48:07,552 --> 01:48:09,856
Let me see the principles he's just on a team

1936
01:48:10,112 --> 01:48:16,256
Your sister his team is weird yeah like his team is not the Republicans

1937
01:48:16,512 --> 01:48:17,024
Rotarians

1938
01:48:17,280 --> 01:48:17,792
8

1939
01:48:18,304 --> 01:48:20,608
That's its anti-government

1940
01:48:20,864 --> 01:48:21,632
Weird

1941
01:48:21,888 --> 01:48:22,912
I Constitution

1942
01:48:23,168 --> 01:48:24,704
That really is

1943
01:48:25,216 --> 01:48:25,728
Swear

1944
01:48:26,752 --> 01:48:28,544
You do point back like

1945
01:48:29,824 --> 01:48:31,616
All over the founding

1946
01:48:32,896 --> 01:48:33,408
Congress's

1947
01:48:33,920 --> 01:48:34,432
I refuse

1948
01:48:34,688 --> 01:48:35,200
To call him the phone

1949
01:48:35,968 --> 01:48:36,992
Sure that's f******

1950
01:48:37,248 --> 01:48:38,784
Annoying

1951
01:48:39,040 --> 01:48:41,600
King annoying not patriarchal just very

1952
01:48:42,112 --> 01:48:48,256
It's what it's like saying the Pledge of Allegiance

1953
01:48:48,768 --> 01:48:50,048
Just in a gross way

1954
01:48:50,304 --> 01:48:52,608
But the the

1955
01:48:52,864 --> 01:48:53,888
Framers of the Constitution

1956
01:48:54,400 --> 01:48:54,912
I don't know why

1957
01:48:55,680 --> 01:49:01,056
Paper and made it words

1958
01:49:01,824 --> 01:49:05,664
Cookie cookie with a paper

1959
01:49:05,920 --> 01:49:06,688
I'm trying so hard

1960
01:49:07,456 --> 01:49:08,736
Richard

1961
01:49:08,992 --> 01:49:09,504
Awful

1962
01:49:09,760 --> 01:49:11,552
The one thing that you will

1963
01:49:11,808 --> 01:49:12,320
You give them

1964
01:49:12,832 --> 01:49:13,344
Is that

1965
01:49:13,600 --> 01:49:14,624
All of those guys

1966
01:49:15,136 --> 01:49:16,416
Really did come from it

1967
01:49:16,672 --> 01:49:17,696
From different angles

1968
01:49:18,464 --> 01:49:20,512
Like there were in general

1969
01:49:20,768 --> 01:49:23,072
The same concept of Republican

1970
01:49:23,328 --> 01:49:23,840
In the Democrats

1971
01:49:24,864 --> 01:49:31,008
That we have now conservative

1972
01:49:44,320 --> 01:49:45,344
We're against

1973
01:49:48,160 --> 01:49:48,672
F******

1974
01:49:48,928 --> 01:49:52,768
Throat

1975
01:50:01,472 --> 01:50:02,752
I'm cool

1976
01:50:03,008 --> 01:50:09,152
Maybe it turns into tyranny down the road but most dangerous

1977
01:50:09,408 --> 01:50:10,432
What is that now

1978
01:50:10,944 --> 01:50:15,808
That is the one thing that you can do with our our overarching

1979
01:50:16,064 --> 01:50:17,600
Idea of the overarching

1980
01:50:18,880 --> 01:50:19,392
The Declaration

1981
01:50:21,696 --> 01:50:23,232
No

1982
01:50:23,488 --> 01:50:26,304
Yeah and right now we have a political party

1983
01:50:26,560 --> 01:50:27,072
That is

1984
01:50:28,864 --> 01:50:30,656
You look at it LOL.

1985
01:50:31,424 --> 01:50:33,216
Probably 40% of the other party

1986
01:50:33,728 --> 01:50:36,032
Like the exact

1987
01:50:36,288 --> 01:50:36,800
The powers-that-be

1988
01:50:38,336 --> 01:50:42,944
Who is maybe in response

1989
01:50:43,200 --> 01:50:44,224
To the fact that we had

1990
01:50:44,736 --> 01:50:45,248
Most

1991
01:50:45,760 --> 01:50:47,296
Obstructive Congress in

1992
01:50:47,552 --> 01:50:48,064
History

1993
01:50:48,320 --> 01:50:49,344
And so the only way to actual

1994
01:50:51,648 --> 01:50:52,416
F*** it I'm doing

1995
01:50:52,672 --> 01:50:55,744
Fayetteville largest financial crisis

1996
01:51:01,376 --> 01:51:05,984
Bunch of wars and fact that's our Healthcare System

1997
01:51:06,496 --> 01:51:11,104
List of reasons why it happens

1998
01:51:11,360 --> 01:51:12,640
How you get to

1999
01:51:12,896 --> 01:51:15,968
Bright like a whole bunch of crises come together

2000
01:51:16,224 --> 01:51:17,504
And people f****** along

2001
01:51:17,760 --> 01:51:20,064
And wants Trump gets away with everything

2002
01:51:20,576 --> 01:51:22,880
He's been doing

2003
01:51:23,136 --> 01:51:23,904
He has

2004
01:51:24,160 --> 01:51:24,928
He will

2005
01:51:25,184 --> 01:51:26,464
And your eyes gotten away with

2006
01:51:27,488 --> 01:51:30,304
Yep and Alex will cheer lead all the way

2007
01:51:30,560 --> 01:51:32,864
Also a couple couple more points

2008
01:51:33,120 --> 01:51:35,168
About the September 15th episode before we get

2009
01:51:35,424 --> 01:51:35,936
More clips

2010
01:51:36,192 --> 01:51:38,752
Yeah I open with John bowne report

2011
01:51:40,032 --> 01:51:42,336
What about Howard

2012
01:51:42,592 --> 01:51:45,152
I do a great job.

2013
01:51:45,408 --> 01:51:51,040
How many episodes start with a John bowne report

2014
01:51:51,552 --> 01:51:52,576
I'm at it because

2015
01:51:54,112 --> 01:51:55,136
The radio station

2016
01:51:55,648 --> 01:51:57,440
Start at 6 of the hour

2017
01:51:57,952 --> 01:51:58,976
Shows start at 6

2018
01:51:59,488 --> 01:52:00,000
Laughter

2019
01:52:00,256 --> 01:52:06,400
Commercials and station identification or what have you

2020
01:52:06,656 --> 01:52:07,424
John bowne report

2021
01:52:09,216 --> 01:52:10,496
F****** babies reports are terrible

2022
01:52:11,008 --> 01:52:12,800
Because I got to fill time until 2

2023
01:52:13,056 --> 01:52:14,848
Stations actually pick up

2024
01:52:15,360 --> 01:52:19,968
More pro-assad stuff more pro-russia business

2025
01:52:20,224 --> 01:52:21,248
Then

2026
01:52:21,504 --> 01:52:23,296
Proceed

2027
01:52:25,600 --> 01:52:26,368
Such a perfect

2028
01:52:26,624 --> 01:52:27,136
Bellwether

2029
01:52:27,648 --> 01:52:28,160
Whether or not

2030
01:52:29,440 --> 01:52:32,256
Like if your profile just f****** died now

2031
01:52:32,768 --> 01:52:33,536
I'm okay

2032
01:52:35,072 --> 01:52:40,448
Super mad about a story that he read about l.a. trying to call themselves the capital of Latin America

2033
01:52:41,472 --> 01:52:43,520
Well you know why they did

2034
01:52:46,336 --> 01:52:47,104
The Olympic

2035
01:52:47,616 --> 01:52:51,456
I was going to the World Cup World Cup to come to LA

2036
01:52:51,712 --> 01:52:53,504
PR campaign

2037
01:52:54,016 --> 01:52:55,040
Talking about how

2038
01:52:55,296 --> 01:53:01,440
North America is one of Latin America

2039
01:53:01,696 --> 01:53:06,304
I'm coming out into the open

2040
01:53:06,560 --> 01:53:08,864
No they wanted to make a ton of money

2041
01:53:09,120 --> 01:53:09,888
Los Angeles

2042
01:53:15,008 --> 01:53:19,104
A very large about it

2043
01:53:22,688 --> 01:53:24,736
Will probably get the Olympics

2044
01:53:24,992 --> 01:53:28,576
And that's why that's why

2045
01:53:28,832 --> 01:53:29,600
Calling

2046
01:53:32,928 --> 01:53:33,696
We need to check in

2047
01:53:34,720 --> 01:53:35,232
Alex

2048
01:53:35,488 --> 01:53:36,000
Like I said

2049
01:53:36,256 --> 01:53:38,816
In that

2050
01:53:39,328 --> 01:53:39,840
Call

2051
01:53:40,096 --> 01:53:40,608
A punk

2052
01:53:41,120 --> 01:53:43,168
Called him to tell him to shut his mouth

2053
01:53:45,984 --> 01:53:47,520
Now it's often

2054
01:53:48,288 --> 01:53:50,592
So now we got to check in on this

2055
01:53:50,848 --> 01:53:52,128
15th of September

2056
01:53:52,384 --> 01:53:54,432
Has some thoughts about Trump is where we're at

2057
01:53:54,688 --> 01:53:58,272
Trump

2058
01:53:58,528 --> 01:54:00,576
Because I love Rand Paul real

2059
01:54:01,344 --> 01:54:03,904
I support him I want him to win

2060
01:54:04,928 --> 01:54:08,512
I know he's listing more milquetoast political advisors

2061
01:54:08,768 --> 01:54:12,096
General election

2062
01:54:12,608 --> 01:54:14,912
Because he's too extreme he's not a string

2063
01:54:15,680 --> 01:54:17,984
I don't know I trust or not I don't know

2064
01:54:18,752 --> 01:54:19,264
But

2065
01:54:20,800 --> 01:54:22,336
I dunno what he's saying is true

2066
01:54:22,592 --> 01:54:23,616
And that's why you so popular

2067
01:54:24,128 --> 01:54:25,408
We're back to where we started

2068
01:54:25,920 --> 01:54:27,456
Of course we have made no progress

2069
01:54:27,968 --> 01:54:30,016
Nundi win it just went

2070
01:54:31,296 --> 01:54:32,064
Yeah

2071
01:54:32,320 --> 01:54:38,464
He's very going on and the Baseline is I like what he saying but I don't trust him

2072
01:54:38,720 --> 01:54:39,232
I think it's

2073
01:54:39,488 --> 01:54:41,024
Real problem so far

2074
01:54:41,536 --> 01:54:42,048
To be the

2075
01:54:42,816 --> 01:54:44,864
Rand Paul actually believe

2076
01:54:47,936 --> 01:54:49,984
And Alex Jones doesn't actually believe in what he says

2077
01:54:50,752 --> 01:54:52,032
That might be part of the tension

2078
01:54:52,288 --> 01:54:54,080
Like that's what it seems to me like

2079
01:54:54,848 --> 01:54:57,152
And I think Grandpa is a little smarter than Alex

2080
01:54:58,688 --> 01:55:01,504
So much smarter than Alex

2081
01:55:01,760 --> 01:55:04,064
What is possible what is impossible

2082
01:55:05,088 --> 01:55:07,648
Is also sucking dick

2083
01:55:10,464 --> 01:55:13,024
But faster

2084
01:55:13,280 --> 01:55:13,792
Inconsistent

2085
01:55:15,072 --> 01:55:17,120
Which is something that we cannot say about

2086
01:55:17,632 --> 01:55:19,680
Partial tear

2087
01:55:19,936 --> 01:55:21,216
Alex

2088
01:55:24,800 --> 01:55:25,312
Is the wind

2089
01:55:25,568 --> 01:55:26,848
Blows wherever it may

2090
01:55:27,360 --> 01:55:31,200
On this episode he has that interview with the guy from the citizens for guns

2091
01:55:31,456 --> 01:55:31,968
Or whatever

2092
01:55:32,224 --> 01:55:38,368
Remember the name of the organization and I'll tell you this it's not important

2093
01:55:42,464 --> 01:55:44,000
And the other

2094
01:55:46,048 --> 01:55:47,328
He's just sitting in the room

2095
01:55:47,584 --> 01:55:48,864
Yeah doing this interview with Alex

2096
01:55:49,888 --> 01:55:51,936
They end up having this conversation

2097
01:55:53,472 --> 01:55:55,776
This is the second instance of

2098
01:55:56,288 --> 01:55:57,824
Historical revision

2099
01:55:58,336 --> 01:56:00,640
I think it's slightly less offensive than the Holocaust

2100
01:56:00,896 --> 01:56:02,944
Denial that Alex engaged in previously

2101
01:56:03,200 --> 01:56:04,480
But it is just as well

2102
01:56:04,736 --> 01:56:07,296
Federal government you can go here and no farther

2103
01:56:09,088 --> 01:56:10,880
Then the second amendment comes into play

2104
01:56:12,160 --> 01:56:13,952
And to put it a little bit more crudely

2105
01:56:14,208 --> 01:56:16,768
If you try to act

2106
01:56:17,024 --> 01:56:17,536
Tyrannical

2107
01:56:30,592 --> 01:56:32,896
Wasn't about

2108
01:56:33,664 --> 01:56:37,760
About

2109
01:56:38,016 --> 01:56:38,784
Being free

2110
01:56:39,040 --> 01:56:40,576
The Revolutionary War

2111
01:56:40,832 --> 01:56:41,600
Was about Gunn

2112
01:56:43,904 --> 01:56:46,720
That's okay

2113
01:56:47,232 --> 01:56:50,560
Alex

2114
01:56:50,816 --> 01:56:51,328
The Declaration of

2115
01:56:52,096 --> 01:56:52,608
Sarah likes

2116
01:56:55,424 --> 01:56:57,216
That's why was the Second Amendment

2117
01:56:58,496 --> 01:57:03,360
Yeah I think that there was were more issues about taxation

2118
01:57:03,616 --> 01:57:04,640
Certainly Alex loves

2119
01:57:04,896 --> 01:57:08,224
To bring up Harris we talked about the Civil War this one might be more appropriate

2120
01:57:08,480 --> 01:57:12,064
There was a

2121
01:57:12,320 --> 01:57:12,832
Redress

2122
01:57:13,088 --> 01:57:15,392
Of grievances there was no representation

2123
01:57:18,720 --> 01:57:20,000
I know that

2124
01:57:20,512 --> 01:57:22,304
Parties Boston Tea Party

2125
01:57:22,816 --> 01:57:23,840
Was not about gun

2126
01:57:24,352 --> 01:57:24,864
I know that

2127
01:57:27,168 --> 01:57:32,544
Maybe what else what else

2128
01:57:33,056 --> 01:57:33,568
I don't need to

2129
01:57:35,872 --> 01:57:36,896
Not

2130
01:57:37,152 --> 01:57:38,176
It's just an assertion

2131
01:57:38,432 --> 01:57:41,760
It's just an assertion that the Revolutionary War was about guns

2132
01:57:43,552 --> 01:57:44,064
What

2133
01:57:45,856 --> 01:57:46,368
I mean

2134
01:57:50,464 --> 01:57:52,000
What do you say to somebody who believes

2135
01:57:52,256 --> 01:57:53,792
Is that the Civil War was about

2136
01:57:54,048 --> 01:57:54,560
States rights

2137
01:57:55,840 --> 01:57:57,120
Like what words

2138
01:57:57,888 --> 01:57:58,912
Are possible

2139
01:57:59,168 --> 01:58:01,216
I think there's a way though to like

2140
01:58:01,984 --> 01:58:03,264
I don't Tara snow

2141
01:58:03,520 --> 01:58:05,824
That's not true I think there is a way

2142
01:58:06,336 --> 01:58:09,152
To look back on what happened

2143
01:58:10,688 --> 01:58:11,200
The Civil War

2144
01:58:12,480 --> 01:58:13,248
Rewrite it

2145
01:58:13,760 --> 01:58:14,784
Reasonably

2146
01:58:15,296 --> 01:58:15,808
With the states

2147
01:58:17,856 --> 01:58:19,136
What's going on

2148
01:58:19,392 --> 01:58:19,904
Then

2149
01:58:20,160 --> 01:58:23,488
This is going to be a dangerous argument for me to make this is already Danger

2150
01:58:24,256 --> 01:58:25,280
I think

2151
01:58:26,304 --> 01:58:27,840
In hindsight

2152
01:58:28,096 --> 01:58:31,168
You can make the argument that what they were trying to argue

2153
01:58:32,960 --> 01:58:38,080
That we should be able to decide whatever is legal in our state federal government

2154
01:58:38,336 --> 01:58:39,104
Like

2155
01:58:39,360 --> 01:58:40,640
Think you can do that you can't

2156
01:58:40,896 --> 01:58:43,200
Use what they were saying back then

2157
01:58:43,456 --> 01:58:44,224
To make your argument

2158
01:58:45,504 --> 01:58:46,016
Clearly

2159
01:58:46,784 --> 01:58:48,064
But you could do that

2160
01:58:48,832 --> 01:58:52,160
I don't think you can do that with the Revolutionary War being about guns

2161
01:58:52,672 --> 01:58:53,184
Absolutely

2162
01:58:53,440 --> 01:58:54,720
Cuz I don't think

2163
01:58:54,976 --> 01:58:58,048
Do you know what I don't know

2164
01:58:58,304 --> 01:58:58,816
Between

2165
01:58:59,072 --> 01:59:00,608
The British and US was

2166
01:59:01,376 --> 01:59:01,888
Gun owners

2167
01:59:02,400 --> 01:59:04,448
Do you know what the primary disagreement

2168
01:59:05,472 --> 01:59:05,984
That

2169
01:59:06,752 --> 01:59:07,264
Is

2170
01:59:07,776 --> 01:59:08,288
Through-line

2171
01:59:09,568 --> 01:59:10,080
The Revolutionary

2172
01:59:10,336 --> 01:59:10,848
Pre-war and the

2173
01:59:11,104 --> 01:59:11,872
Civil War

2174
01:59:12,384 --> 01:59:13,408
Rich people are fuc

2175
01:59:13,664 --> 01:59:14,176
I think it's over

2176
01:59:14,432 --> 01:59:14,944
Yeah that's true

2177
01:59:15,456 --> 01:59:18,016
That's what that's what the argument has been

2178
01:59:18,272 --> 01:59:19,296
That's what the argument

2179
01:59:19,808 --> 01:59:20,320
As always

2180
01:59:20,576 --> 01:59:23,136
End of the Revolutionary War

2181
01:59:24,160 --> 01:59:26,464
And the Civil War

2182
01:59:27,744 --> 01:59:29,280
It was the rich

2183
01:59:29,792 --> 01:59:30,816
The rich people

2184
01:59:33,120 --> 01:59:37,472
Okay and I don't I don't want to pull out

2185
01:59:37,728 --> 01:59:38,752
Because they were employment

2186
01:59:40,032 --> 01:59:42,336
Even though it wasn't even the southern

2187
01:59:45,664 --> 01:59:46,688
And then it was racist

2188
01:59:46,944 --> 01:59:52,832
It was the whole time about how black people are

2189
01:59:53,344 --> 01:59:57,440
Right it is it is always and I'm not going to pull up

2190
01:59:58,464 --> 02:00:00,512
Hardcore socialist

2191
02:00:01,024 --> 02:00:01,536
Argument

2192
02:00:02,048 --> 02:00:03,584
I am just going to

2193
02:00:03,840 --> 02:00:05,376
To point out the same thing that

2194
02:00:05,632 --> 02:00:06,400
Always been

2195
02:00:06,656 --> 02:00:09,472
True that it's a rich man's war and a poor man

2196
02:00:10,240 --> 02:00:11,520
Rich people always

2197
02:00:11,776 --> 02:00:12,288
Wind-up

2198
02:00:13,568 --> 02:00:14,848
Yeah

2199
02:00:15,104 --> 02:00:15,616
Winning

2200
02:00:15,872 --> 02:00:17,664
Others regardless of who wins

2201
02:00:20,736 --> 02:00:25,088
F****** insane I mean Smart in terms of like cunning

2202
02:00:25,344 --> 02:00:29,952
In terms of evil ability to no matter what the outcome I mean

2203
02:00:30,464 --> 02:00:34,816
Information

2204
02:00:35,584 --> 02:00:39,680
They're not smart

2205
02:00:39,936 --> 02:00:40,448
Brilliant

2206
02:00:40,704 --> 02:00:45,824
The guys who voted on the health-care bill

2207
02:00:46,592 --> 02:00:48,640
We're like okay well we're going to invest

2208
02:00:48,896 --> 02:00:49,920
In the same day

2209
02:00:50,176 --> 02:00:51,200
On companies that

2210
02:00:54,528 --> 02:00:55,808
From this exact vote

2211
02:00:56,064 --> 02:00:57,600
Yeah not that they're smarter than

2212
02:00:59,648 --> 02:01:00,160
A butt

2213
02:01:00,416 --> 02:01:03,232
Manipulating the system that we allowed

2214
02:01:05,536 --> 02:01:08,608
The day before September 15th

2215
02:01:08,864 --> 02:01:10,144
Something really f***** up happen

2216
02:01:10,400 --> 02:01:12,448
What number 14

2217
02:01:12,704 --> 02:01:13,728
Donald Trump

2218
02:01:13,984 --> 02:01:14,752
Had a rally

2219
02:01:15,264 --> 02:01:15,776
Intex

2220
02:01:16,288 --> 02:01:18,848
Okay and Joe Biggs went to the rally

2221
02:01:19,360 --> 02:01:20,384
I bet he asked

2222
02:01:20,896 --> 02:01:21,408
Insider information

2223
02:01:22,176 --> 02:01:22,688
Never found

2224
02:01:24,992 --> 02:01:25,760
A couple clips

2225
02:01:26,016 --> 02:01:29,088
From Joe Biggs reporting about going to

2226
02:01:29,344 --> 02:01:29,856
To the Trump rally

2227
02:01:33,696 --> 02:01:34,208
The MoMA

2228
02:01:35,488 --> 02:01:36,000
When

2229
02:01:36,256 --> 02:01:37,536
Alex Jones realize

2230
02:01:38,304 --> 02:01:39,072
Trump's the way to go

2231
02:01:40,096 --> 02:01:40,608
Yeah

2232
02:01:40,864 --> 02:01:41,376
No s***

2233
02:01:41,632 --> 02:01:42,144
Now

2234
02:01:42,400 --> 02:01:42,912
I'm not

2235
02:01:43,168 --> 02:01:44,448
Really sure about this

2236
02:01:45,216 --> 02:01:47,776
Doesn't give a lot of indication

2237
02:01:48,288 --> 02:01:48,800
But I'm correct

2238
02:01:49,056 --> 02:01:51,104
But I will make my argument over the course

2239
02:01:51,360 --> 02:01:52,128
The next three or four

2240
02:01:53,664 --> 02:01:54,688
Hero 3 hours

2241
02:01:56,224 --> 02:01:57,760
We got way more than that

2242
02:01:59,296 --> 02:02:02,368
The first clip of Joe Biggs reporting about going to the Trump

2243
02:02:03,136 --> 02:02:03,648
And

2244
02:02:04,160 --> 02:02:05,696
Again it is not what you'd expect

2245
02:02:10,560 --> 02:02:11,840
Lorie Line

2246
02:02:13,632 --> 02:02:17,216
He says a lot of good things out there

2247
02:02:21,824 --> 02:02:26,176
He's not motivated or convicted in a sense when it comes to the issues at hand

2248
02:02:26,432 --> 02:02:30,784
Issues in a presidential candidate

2249
02:02:31,040 --> 02:02:32,832
Have knowledge in

2250
02:02:33,344 --> 02:02:35,136
Certain questions about these issues

2251
02:02:35,392 --> 02:02:41,536
He doesn't have a really good answer he doesn't know what he's doing he kind of reminded me of Rodney Dangerfield Woody's one-liners

2252
02:02:41,792 --> 02:02:46,144
Like hey we got a border problem huh what are we going to do about it

2253
02:02:46,400 --> 02:02:47,680
Art stores

2254
02:02:48,192 --> 02:02:54,336
All he does he bring to the table without a solution

2255
02:02:54,592 --> 02:02:56,640
Go to the table without him giving any kind of clear

2256
02:02:56,896 --> 02:03:00,480
The how he was going to get the pollution to these

2257
02:03:00,736 --> 02:03:03,040
Issues we know I won't work

2258
02:03:05,088 --> 02:03:08,672
What really works is Prosecuting people that are little

2259
02:03:08,928 --> 02:03:09,952
So at this point

2260
02:03:10,208 --> 02:03:10,720
That

2261
02:03:12,512 --> 02:03:16,096
Slightly reasonable report

2262
02:03:16,608 --> 02:03:22,496
I'm going to get into this next clip of the two of them kind of advocating for

2263
02:03:22,752 --> 02:03:25,568
Reasonable moderate immigration reform

2264
02:03:26,080 --> 02:03:28,640
Trump Jones

2265
02:03:29,152 --> 02:03:32,992
Saying that a wall won't work when months later

2266
02:03:33,248 --> 02:03:39,392
He's screaming about a walk is the most important

2267
02:03:42,208 --> 02:03:42,720
Which there isn't

2268
02:03:42,976 --> 02:03:46,304
Later

2269
02:03:47,328 --> 02:03:48,864
He has an interview with Jesse Ventura

2270
02:03:49,120 --> 02:03:54,240
And Jesse Ventura lives in Mexico what about the wall between Mexico

2271
02:03:54,496 --> 02:03:57,824
He's like I don't know if

2272
02:04:00,640 --> 02:04:06,784
I don't know

2273
02:04:07,040 --> 02:04:09,856
Proposes was the Berlin Wall

2274
02:04:10,112 --> 02:04:12,672
Does inventory also brings up a bunch for it

2275
02:04:12,928 --> 02:04:14,464
But this point like

2276
02:04:16,256 --> 02:04:17,536
He's absolutely making sense

2277
02:04:17,792 --> 02:04:19,840
Trump has a bar like you're about to bring the hammer

2278
02:04:20,352 --> 02:04:22,144
Not yet

2279
02:04:22,400 --> 02:04:23,168
Problem

2280
02:04:23,424 --> 02:04:27,264
No Solutions he's up there he doesn't have a grasp of the air doesn't know what he's talking

2281
02:04:27,520 --> 02:04:31,104
Is just coming in with Rodney Dangerfield style one-liners

2282
02:04:31,360 --> 02:04:31,872
All this is

2283
02:04:32,128 --> 02:04:33,152
Not everybody the Showman

2284
02:04:33,408 --> 02:04:33,920
Right

2285
02:04:34,176 --> 02:04:34,688
Vitamix

2286
02:04:34,944 --> 02:04:38,784
In this next clip they talked a little bit more about immigrants

2287
02:04:41,344 --> 02:04:42,624
Surprisingly modern

2288
02:04:43,136 --> 02:04:44,416
It's very weird

2289
02:04:44,672 --> 02:04:48,000
The month screaming about how

2290
02:04:48,256 --> 02:04:50,048
The globalists are trying to flutter

2291
02:04:50,560 --> 02:04:51,328
With

2292
02:04:52,096 --> 02:04:53,632
People need to get rid of them

2293
02:04:53,888 --> 02:04:54,656
Or not let them in

2294
02:04:55,424 --> 02:04:59,520
This could be no now versus

2295
02:04:59,776 --> 02:05:05,920
Is the man that were in 2015

2296
02:05:12,576 --> 02:05:15,136
The present day of the previous Alex

2297
02:05:15,392 --> 02:05:17,696
In terms of the wall

2298
02:05:17,952 --> 02:05:18,464
Cuz my

2299
02:05:18,720 --> 02:05:19,232
Yeah

2300
02:05:20,256 --> 02:05:22,560
Complete evidence that he sold himself out

2301
02:05:22,816 --> 02:05:25,376
Nothing

2302
02:05:25,632 --> 02:05:26,912
So here here is it bad

2303
02:05:27,424 --> 02:05:29,216
I've labeled this clip Jo and Alex

2304
02:05:29,472 --> 02:05:30,496
Seem very moderate

2305
02:05:30,752 --> 02:05:32,288
On immigration reform

2306
02:05:32,544 --> 02:05:35,872
Going to have every legal out of the country

2307
02:05:42,784 --> 02:05:43,808
And find her

2308
02:05:44,064 --> 02:05:47,904
Are you American I need to see proof

2309
02:05:48,160 --> 02:05:49,440
All the illegals out

2310
02:05:52,768 --> 02:05:57,632
Welfare

2311
02:06:05,056 --> 02:06:11,200
Reasonable position reflective

2312
02:06:12,992 --> 02:06:15,808
What do you actually believe

2313
02:06:16,832 --> 02:06:17,600
It's the way he presents

2314
02:06:18,368 --> 02:06:20,160
Joe Biggs

2315
02:06:21,696 --> 02:06:22,208
Republican

2316
02:06:24,768 --> 02:06:25,280
McCain ran

2317
02:06:25,536 --> 02:06:26,304
Like

2318
02:06:26,560 --> 02:06:28,096
The kind of idea

2319
02:06:28,352 --> 02:06:30,912
Hey we know a lot of people are good

2320
02:06:31,168 --> 02:06:32,960
Just don't want you taking advantage of

2321
02:06:33,728 --> 02:06:39,872
That's what we're going to do steps to stop and as we already of covered when Jesse Ventura was last on he was talking about

2322
02:06:40,128 --> 02:06:43,200
If these people are

2323
02:06:43,456 --> 02:06:46,784
Program say they are

2324
02:06:47,040 --> 02:06:50,880
Why would you not blame the system as opposed the first

2325
02:06:51,392 --> 02:06:54,208
It just trying to survive

2326
02:06:54,976 --> 02:06:55,488
But far more reason

2327
02:06:56,768 --> 02:06:58,048
Joe Biggs is coming in here

2328
02:07:01,888 --> 02:07:04,448
Impossible. Turning into a f****** police

2329
02:07:04,960 --> 02:07:05,984
Absolutely not

2330
02:07:09,824 --> 02:07:12,384
Pushing back against that Alex is fine with the bush

2331
02:07:12,640 --> 02:07:13,664
Yeah

2332
02:07:14,176 --> 02:07:15,200
This next clip

2333
02:07:18,016 --> 02:07:19,296
Just Divergent higher leaf

2334
02:07:20,320 --> 02:07:24,160
No not yet

2335
02:07:32,864 --> 02:07:34,144
Daingerfield

2336
02:07:38,752 --> 02:07:42,336
Teva crowd-pleaser he doesn't know how to work a crowd and that's what he was doing

2337
02:07:42,848 --> 02:07:46,432
He didn't have the first

2338
02:07:46,688 --> 02:07:51,040
We don't have any 15 million dollars

2339
02:07:51,808 --> 02:07:55,136
It took 30 minutes before he even

2340
02:07:55,392 --> 02:07:57,696
He talked about this vague tax plan that he had

2341
02:07:57,952 --> 02:08:04,096
You going to release it

2342
02:08:11,264 --> 02:08:11,776
So

2343
02:08:12,288 --> 02:08:16,384
Wow basically there's no substance to what he's saying

2344
02:08:16,640 --> 02:08:17,664
Carnival Barker

2345
02:08:17,920 --> 02:08:19,456
But at the end

2346
02:08:19,712 --> 02:08:20,992
Talkin about how

2347
02:08:21,504 --> 02:08:22,784
Even with that lack of Subs

2348
02:08:23,808 --> 02:08:24,320
Crazy

2349
02:08:25,344 --> 02:08:25,856
They were in

2350
02:08:26,112 --> 02:08:26,624
In Arena

2351
02:08:29,952 --> 02:08:31,232
Trump is able to draw

2352
02:08:31,744 --> 02:08:32,512
These crowds

2353
02:08:32,768 --> 02:08:34,048
These massive crowd

2354
02:08:34,816 --> 02:08:35,840
That are mind-blowing

2355
02:08:36,096 --> 02:08:37,120
Oh he would be

2356
02:08:37,376 --> 02:08:38,400
Booked at The Improv

2357
02:08:42,240 --> 02:08:46,336
Woodlake

2358
02:08:47,872 --> 02:08:48,640
I pay for that

2359
02:08:50,432 --> 02:08:52,736
So I think this is

2360
02:08:57,856 --> 02:09:00,160
I think

2361
02:09:00,416 --> 02:09:01,952
We've heard a lot of

2362
02:09:02,208 --> 02:09:03,232
A very reasonable

2363
02:09:03,488 --> 02:09:04,000
Respect

2364
02:09:04,256 --> 02:09:05,024
The Joe Biggs has

2365
02:09:05,536 --> 02:09:06,304
From going

2366
02:09:06,560 --> 02:09:08,096
New to this Trump rally

2367
02:09:08,352 --> 02:09:09,120
But I think

2368
02:09:09,632 --> 02:09:10,400
We're going to

2369
02:09:10,656 --> 02:09:11,680
Start to see here

2370
02:09:12,960 --> 02:09:13,728
It's going to start today

2371
02:09:13,984 --> 02:09:16,544
Deteriorate well maybe beginning of the end

2372
02:09:17,056 --> 02:09:20,640
Maybe I'll make my point after this clip Anthony

2373
02:09:21,152 --> 02:09:23,200
Also do you know how great Todd glasses

2374
02:09:23,456 --> 02:09:24,224
Hilarious

2375
02:09:24,480 --> 02:09:27,040
Can't stop anytime you bring up Rodney

2376
02:09:27,296 --> 02:09:29,856
Dangerfield now I don't think of Rodney Dangerfield

2377
02:09:31,392 --> 02:09:33,184
Mitch Hedberg

2378
02:09:33,696 --> 02:09:34,720
In Rodney Danger

2379
02:09:35,232 --> 02:09:36,256
Rodney Dangerfield

2380
02:09:36,512 --> 02:09:38,816
He's the best it's just amazing anyways

2381
02:09:39,328 --> 02:09:40,096
Not the best

2382
02:09:41,632 --> 02:09:47,520
My Hillary for prison 2016 t-shirt

2383
02:09:47,776 --> 02:09:48,544
Under my suit

2384
02:09:49,056 --> 02:09:55,200
The best seller we have photos you sent me those photos

2385
02:09:55,456 --> 02:09:58,272
Of my cell phone in the front row

2386
02:10:01,600 --> 02:10:03,392
A shirt like Superman

2387
02:10:03,648 --> 02:10:09,792
And you can see the Hillary for prison

2388
02:10:19,776 --> 02:10:21,568
It did that for real

2389
02:10:22,080 --> 02:10:22,592
A ditch

2390
02:10:22,848 --> 02:10:24,640
Well

2391
02:10:24,896 --> 02:10:26,432
So he's like

2392
02:10:26,688 --> 02:10:28,736
Punk 1007

2393
02:10:29,248 --> 02:10:32,064
Trump is in the middle of saying something with the crowd like

2394
02:10:36,416 --> 02:10:37,696
He yells Hillary for prison

2395
02:10:38,208 --> 02:10:39,744
Trump is like

2396
02:10:40,256 --> 02:10:42,304
The polls Hillary

2397
02:10:43,584 --> 02:10:44,608
Highest points over

2398
02:10:47,424 --> 02:10:48,192
But hear me out on this

2399
02:10:49,728 --> 02:10:51,008
Has been jerking off for

2400
02:10:51,264 --> 02:10:51,776
3 years

2401
02:10:53,568 --> 02:10:55,616
They're as a marketing possible

2402
02:10:56,384 --> 02:11:00,224
The idea of going there and finding out what's going on with Trump

2403
02:11:00,480 --> 02:11:02,784
Was secondary to the idea of field test

2404
02:11:03,040 --> 02:11:04,064
Nothing is Hillary

2405
02:11:04,832 --> 02:11:08,928
So he goes there as a marketing opportunity because Trump has pulled

2406
02:11:09,184 --> 02:11:11,232
An arena full of people today

2407
02:11:11,488 --> 02:11:13,792
Which is there might be audience Crossover with

2408
02:11:14,304 --> 02:11:17,632
SoJO big goes down there he does the Superman sing

2409
02:11:17,888 --> 02:11:19,424
People seem to really like it

2410
02:11:19,680 --> 02:11:20,960
Now listen to this next clip

2411
02:11:21,728 --> 02:11:27,872
In the entire crowd erupted

2412
02:11:41,696 --> 02:11:44,000
Thinking of what we're doing

2413
02:11:57,312 --> 02:12:03,200
So sorry about the sound on the clips from this episode

2414
02:12:04,992 --> 02:12:06,016
That this is the mama

2415
02:12:07,040 --> 02:12:08,576
This is at the Hillary for prison

2416
02:12:09,600 --> 02:12:13,696
It's because of the potential sales of Hillary for prison

2417
02:12:17,280 --> 02:12:17,792
Bear

2418
02:12:18,048 --> 02:12:18,560
Yeah tall

2419
02:12:20,352 --> 02:12:21,120
I f******

2420
02:12:21,376 --> 02:12:22,400
Love and Hate

2421
02:12:22,656 --> 02:12:23,680
How my perspective

2422
02:12:23,936 --> 02:12:27,008
Keep changing based on the information that we keep getting

2423
02:12:27,264 --> 02:12:28,800
But I legitimately think

2424
02:12:29,312 --> 02:12:29,824
That

2425
02:12:30,080 --> 02:12:31,616
That moment for them is trans

2426
02:12:31,872 --> 02:12:36,480
Informative cuz they realized

2427
02:12:37,504 --> 02:12:39,040
Alex Jones loves Trump

2428
02:12:39,296 --> 02:12:39,808
Now

2429
02:12:40,320 --> 02:12:40,832
Because of

2430
02:12:42,880 --> 02:12:47,744
Hakeem go beyond t-shirt sales it's at Market if fertile Market

2431
02:12:48,256 --> 02:12:54,400
Alex Jones couldn't get people to show up somewhere

2432
02:12:57,728 --> 02:13:01,568
Dustin like gristy Georgia

2433
02:13:02,080 --> 02:13:06,688
I imagine behind-the-scenes they did

2434
02:13:06,944 --> 02:13:11,296
But I saw a spike in traffic to the site

2435
02:13:11,552 --> 02:13:13,856
Probably got a bunch of sales from it and they're like

2436
02:13:14,880 --> 02:13:21,024
Might be something we need to do

2437
02:13:23,840 --> 02:13:26,656
Too much right

2438
02:13:27,424 --> 02:13:29,216
Yeah that's taking it to the streets

2439
02:13:32,544 --> 02:13:33,568
Alright we're done with that

2440
02:13:34,848 --> 02:13:35,616
Relieved

2441
02:13:35,872 --> 02:13:36,640
On the 50

2442
02:13:39,712 --> 02:13:41,504
Dumb bulshit that happens on that show

2443
02:13:41,760 --> 02:13:44,832
Alex Jones does reveal he doesn't want to

2444
02:13:45,344 --> 02:13:46,368
But he does say

2445
02:13:46,624 --> 02:13:47,904
They cost him over 50

2446
02:13:48,160 --> 02:13:49,184
18 million dollars

2447
02:13:52,256 --> 02:13:53,024
So if you

2448
02:13:53,280 --> 02:13:54,560
You take that number

2449
02:13:55,072 --> 02:13:55,584
And you can

2450
02:13:55,840 --> 02:13:56,608
Twitter

2451
02:14:00,192 --> 02:14:01,472
Right is about

2452
02:14:01,728 --> 02:14:02,240
Chameleon

2453
02:14:05,312 --> 02:14:08,896
It's in the realm of believable

2454
02:14:09,408 --> 02:14:11,712
Exaggerating is always

2455
02:14:13,248 --> 02:14:13,760
Jasmine

2456
02:14:14,528 --> 02:14:17,088
Let's meet in the middle at 12 but be that as it may

2457
02:14:17,600 --> 02:14:18,368
It don't matter

2458
02:14:21,440 --> 02:14:22,720
It doesn't really matter

2459
02:14:22,976 --> 02:14:25,024
What are the number is 10 or 15

2460
02:14:25,280 --> 02:14:25,792
Because

2461
02:14:26,304 --> 02:14:28,352
The money bomb that we're about to get into

2462
02:14:28,864 --> 02:14:30,144
Cuz we're about to jump into the six

2463
02:14:30,400 --> 02:14:31,680
Just the beginning of the month

2464
02:14:32,704 --> 02:14:34,240
28 hour live

2465
02:14:35,776 --> 02:14:36,544
He doesn't

2466
02:14:36,800 --> 02:14:38,592
He's trying to make $1000000

2467
02:14:39,872 --> 02:14:40,896
So

2468
02:14:41,664 --> 02:14:42,176
He's trying to make a

2469
02:14:42,944 --> 02:14:45,248
Play but he's trying to make a certain amount of money

2470
02:14:45,760 --> 02:14:46,784
Hopefully tamilia

2471
02:14:47,040 --> 02:14:47,552
Right

2472
02:14:48,064 --> 02:14:49,088
All things

2473
02:14:49,344 --> 02:14:51,904
He says he wants to do with million dollars

2474
02:14:52,416 --> 02:14:56,256
Is weird. About shooting the show into Europe

2475
02:14:56,512 --> 02:14:59,328
What you said what you said already

2476
02:14:59,584 --> 02:15:02,656
We're not going to do that immediately

2477
02:15:05,216 --> 02:15:06,752
Stuffy's already doing

2478
02:15:07,264 --> 02:15:08,288
Paying for reporters

2479
02:15:08,800 --> 02:15:10,080
Paying for cameras

2480
02:15:10,336 --> 02:15:12,384
Paying for syndication

2481
02:15:12,640 --> 02:15:14,176
Paying for closed captioning

2482
02:15:14,432 --> 02:15:16,480
Already

2483
02:15:16,992 --> 02:15:21,856
So all of that million dollars is just operating expenses

2484
02:15:22,112 --> 02:15:25,440
This million dollars for

2485
02:15:30,048 --> 02:15:32,352
Cuz these are I watch this s*** on YouTube

2486
02:15:33,376 --> 02:15:34,656
This looks exactly the same

2487
02:15:34,912 --> 02:15:35,424
Jezebel

2488
02:15:35,936 --> 02:15:37,216
There is no

2489
02:15:37,472 --> 02:15:39,264
Inspiron 15

2490
02:15:39,520 --> 02:15:40,288
2017

2491
02:15:40,544 --> 02:15:43,616
There is no discernible change that has been made in

2492
02:15:43,872 --> 02:15:44,640
In terms of

2493
02:15:44,896 --> 02:15:46,176
The studio

2494
02:15:47,200 --> 02:15:48,736
There are no people

2495
02:15:48,992 --> 02:15:50,272
Who are there

2496
02:15:50,528 --> 02:15:51,040
That

2497
02:15:51,808 --> 02:15:52,320
Rapable

2498
02:15:52,832 --> 02:15:55,136
No talk off Rapport work for free

2499
02:15:56,416 --> 02:15:58,464
They're probably does rapport the soldier

2500
02:16:01,280 --> 02:16:05,632
But there's no

2501
02:16:05,888 --> 02:16:07,680
Greater number of people that work there

2502
02:16:07,936 --> 02:16:11,008
Did aren't balanced out by the last numbers

2503
02:16:11,264 --> 02:16:12,800
No

2504
02:16:13,056 --> 02:16:14,080
So there isn't

2505
02:16:14,336 --> 02:16:15,104
Really like

2506
02:16:15,616 --> 02:16:18,176
Wide expansion

2507
02:16:18,944 --> 02:16:19,968
You pretended that

2508
02:16:20,224 --> 02:16:21,760
Expansion in his audiences

2509
02:16:23,296 --> 02:16:26,112
If you look at these statistics that are available on quadcast

2510
02:16:26,368 --> 02:16:27,392
And other tracking

2511
02:16:27,648 --> 02:16:28,928
Sources

2512
02:16:29,440 --> 02:16:33,024
Yeah if you look at the numbers that are on his YouTube videos even they aren't

2513
02:16:33,280 --> 02:16:37,376
He says they are you add all of them up

2514
02:16:37,888 --> 02:16:43,520
But be that as it may raise money for a fictitious thing that didn't happen

2515
02:16:44,032 --> 02:16:47,104
Yeah I understand I understand your point

2516
02:16:48,640 --> 02:16:49,664
To me though

2517
02:16:50,176 --> 02:16:52,992
It seems like it's exactly the same thing as an MP

2518
02:16:53,248 --> 02:16:53,760
Yardley

2519
02:16:54,016 --> 02:16:55,040
Hey we

2520
02:16:55,552 --> 02:16:56,832
Live

2521
02:16:57,088 --> 02:16:58,368
Entirely upon

2522
02:16:58,880 --> 02:16:59,392
Public mod

2523
02:17:00,416 --> 02:17:02,464
But he's because he can't

2524
02:17:02,976 --> 02:17:03,488
Supplicate

2525
02:17:04,512 --> 02:17:05,280
Because he

2526
02:17:05,536 --> 02:17:07,072
He can't be somebody who asked

2527
02:17:07,840 --> 02:17:08,864
Operating

2528
02:17:10,912 --> 02:17:16,288
It's possible hyper-masculine NPR

2529
02:17:16,544 --> 02:17:17,824
It's a hyper-masculine fun

2530
02:17:18,592 --> 02:17:19,616
That's what it seems like

2531
02:17:19,872 --> 02:17:20,896
To me so far

2532
02:17:21,152 --> 02:17:22,688
Typically

2533
02:17:22,944 --> 02:17:26,016
MPR is not going to go hypothetically out of business

2534
02:17:26,272 --> 02:17:28,576
By the end of the year

2535
02:17:28,832 --> 02:17:30,624
And I feel the panic

2536
02:17:31,392 --> 02:17:31,904
I don't think

2537
02:17:32,160 --> 02:17:32,672
Going to go out of business

2538
02:17:33,952 --> 02:17:34,464
You would have to

2539
02:17:37,792 --> 02:17:42,400
Did the reason that strikes me as false

2540
02:17:43,168 --> 02:17:43,680
Biggest

2541
02:17:43,936 --> 02:17:45,728
I know that it's easy for us to get

2542
02:17:45,984 --> 02:17:47,008
MPR

2543
02:17:47,264 --> 02:17:49,824
Liberalism

2544
02:17:52,640 --> 02:17:53,152
Money what a dumbass

2545
02:17:53,664 --> 02:17:55,712
That's what he would think we're doing

2546
02:17:57,248 --> 02:17:58,784
Can donate to knowledge fight if you go to the

2547
02:18:00,832 --> 02:18:03,392
Thank you for all the policy wants

2548
02:18:03,648 --> 02:18:04,160
Thank you to all the

2549
02:18:06,208 --> 02:18:06,720
I'm getting a

2550
02:18:06,976 --> 02:18:08,256
Circumstances

2551
02:18:08,512 --> 02:18:10,048
Much more

2552
02:18:11,328 --> 02:18:12,864
Yeah cuz you presenting

2553
02:18:13,376 --> 02:18:14,400
Fictitious expansion

2554
02:18:14,656 --> 02:18:15,424
Of the show

2555
02:18:17,472 --> 02:18:19,776
He's doing it at the end of the fiscal year

2556
02:18:20,288 --> 02:18:20,800
Which is 2

2557
02:18:21,824 --> 02:18:24,896
And then the third is keys in this will-they-won't-they

2558
02:18:25,152 --> 02:18:25,920
Situation with

2559
02:18:26,176 --> 02:18:26,688
Trump

2560
02:18:26,944 --> 02:18:27,712
3 super

2561
02:18:27,968 --> 02:18:28,480
Bucked up

2562
02:18:28,736 --> 02:18:30,272
That's

2563
02:18:31,296 --> 02:18:32,320
It's not about

2564
02:18:32,576 --> 02:18:33,088
It's

2565
02:18:34,880 --> 02:18:36,672
If that because he needs money

2566
02:18:37,184 --> 02:18:38,208
There is motive

2567
02:18:38,976 --> 02:18:40,768
In order to make the

2568
02:18:41,024 --> 02:18:42,304
That's what we're talk

2569
02:18:42,560 --> 02:18:47,424
A baby are going to do a fundraiser and then

2570
02:18:47,680 --> 02:18:48,192
Stealth

2571
02:18:48,448 --> 02:18:50,240
V

2572
02:18:50,496 --> 02:18:51,520
Because of it

2573
02:18:52,288 --> 02:18:54,592
Legitimate news sources don't have

2574
02:18:54,848 --> 02:18:55,616
Like

2575
02:18:56,128 --> 02:18:56,640
They are

2576
02:18:56,896 --> 02:18:58,432
Doing subversive

2577
02:18:58,944 --> 02:19:00,224
Marketing

2578
02:19:00,480 --> 02:19:01,760
The guardian is

2579
02:19:02,272 --> 02:19:03,040
Now

2580
02:19:03,296 --> 02:19:04,576
Blacklist

2581
02:19:05,344 --> 02:19:06,112
Journalism

2582
02:19:06,368 --> 02:19:07,392
Needs to be paid

2583
02:19:08,672 --> 02:19:10,464
Rather than put us behind

2584
02:19:11,488 --> 02:19:12,512
We need you to donate

2585
02:19:15,072 --> 02:19:18,912
Yeah the guardian all the sudden

2586
02:19:19,168 --> 02:19:19,936
Become the f***

2587
02:19:20,704 --> 02:19:21,984
A Daily Mail

2588
02:19:22,240 --> 02:19:23,264
No because

2589
02:19:23,520 --> 02:19:24,544
Trump gave them

2590
02:19:26,592 --> 02:19:29,664
I would hope not because Trump gave them 10 million dollars

2591
02:19:32,224 --> 02:19:32,992
Is that the areas

2592
02:19:33,248 --> 02:19:34,272
Probably

2593
02:19:35,040 --> 02:19:35,552
A future

2594
02:19:36,576 --> 02:19:37,600
Better civilization

2595
02:19:37,856 --> 02:19:38,368
Involved

2596
02:19:38,880 --> 02:19:39,904
All public

2597
02:19:40,160 --> 02:19:41,440
Financing

2598
02:19:41,696 --> 02:19:43,232
4 presidential campaign

2599
02:19:43,488 --> 02:19:44,512
Political campaign

2600
02:19:44,768 --> 02:19:45,536
And journal

2601
02:19:48,352 --> 02:19:48,864
Does Michael

2602
02:19:49,376 --> 02:19:54,240
Need to be incredibly unbiased

2603
02:19:54,496 --> 02:19:56,032
I hate Alex Jones

2604
02:19:56,288 --> 02:19:57,056
Are we hate Trump

2605
02:19:57,312 --> 02:19:59,360
But at the same time

2606
02:20:02,432 --> 02:20:08,576
I think you can go back and look at my previous statements and do that I have no bias

2607
02:20:08,832 --> 02:20:10,368
Clear but at the same time

2608
02:20:10,624 --> 02:20:12,160
When I was dead stuff that's like

2609
02:20:12,416 --> 02:20:13,440
Yeah rock and roll

2610
02:20:13,696 --> 02:20:14,976
We've been totally cool with that

2611
02:20:15,232 --> 02:20:16,256
Weave

2612
02:20:19,072 --> 02:20:19,584
Props

2613
02:20:19,840 --> 02:20:20,352
Also

2614
02:20:20,608 --> 02:20:21,120
Alex

2615
02:20:21,632 --> 02:20:24,704
You really need to look into what Jeff sessions is doing with syphilis

2616
02:20:24,960 --> 02:20:25,728
Forfeiture

2617
02:20:25,984 --> 02:20:28,288
So far no comment

2618
02:20:30,848 --> 02:20:31,616
Dissident by Pearl Jam

2619
02:20:33,664 --> 02:20:35,200
Committed

2620
02:20:37,248 --> 02:20:37,760
Because he's

2621
02:20:38,016 --> 02:20:39,040
He's under investigation

2622
02:20:42,368 --> 02:20:43,136
To take his stuff

2623
02:20:43,392 --> 02:20:44,416
By his own rules

2624
02:20:44,928 --> 02:20:46,976
The great point

2625
02:20:47,232 --> 02:20:49,792
Galaxy us those assets

2626
02:20:50,304 --> 02:20:53,120
So citizens civil forfeiture

2627
02:20:53,632 --> 02:20:55,168
Have a great

2628
02:20:56,448 --> 02:20:59,776
Like maybe 60 bucks

2629
02:21:02,336 --> 02:21:04,128
Speaking of things that have to do with money

2630
02:21:04,384 --> 02:21:05,920
Jordan

2631
02:21:12,320 --> 02:21:14,880
Here's the bad news

2632
02:21:15,136 --> 02:21:21,280
Look up the money is

2633
02:21:21,792 --> 02:21:23,328
Incredibly boring

2634
02:21:23,840 --> 02:21:24,864
Of course it is

2635
02:21:25,120 --> 02:21:30,496
27 hours or whatever the f*** it was I didn't watch any of it they didn't have Alex Jones on it

2636
02:21:30,752 --> 02:21:33,824
Smart but there is one piece that I wish I could watch

2637
02:21:36,384 --> 02:21:37,920
Because why would five

2638
02:21:39,456 --> 02:21:40,736
Yeah you've already hurt yourself

2639
02:21:41,504 --> 02:21:42,016
Arnaud arbery

2640
02:21:42,272 --> 02:21:45,088
Here's something that we didn't realize about

2641
02:21:45,344 --> 02:21:45,856
The money bomb

2642
02:21:46,624 --> 02:21:48,672
It is at the end of the fiscal year

2643
02:21:49,184 --> 02:21:51,232
But do you know what else happened on September

2644
02:21:51,744 --> 02:21:52,256
No

2645
02:21:52,512 --> 02:21:54,304
The second Republican

2646
02:21:54,560 --> 02:21:55,328
Presidential

2647
02:21:55,840 --> 02:21:58,400
Debate

2648
02:21:58,656 --> 02:22:00,192
To be on the night of the debate

2649
02:22:00,448 --> 02:22:01,728
Oh s*** that's really

2650
02:22:01,984 --> 02:22:03,008
Smart

2651
02:22:03,264 --> 02:22:04,544
Really smart

2652
02:22:04,800 --> 02:22:05,568
You got to give him credit

2653
02:22:05,824 --> 02:22:10,432
Is Lee Ann McAdoo David Knight

2654
02:22:10,944 --> 02:22:12,992
I think Rob do the third person

2655
02:22:14,784 --> 02:22:16,320
Mystery Science Theater

2656
02:22:16,576 --> 02:22:17,856
The debate

2657
02:22:24,768 --> 02:22:26,304
F****** wow

2658
02:22:26,560 --> 02:22:29,120
I saw a couple clips of it and it's

2659
02:22:33,472 --> 02:22:33,984
Nothing

2660
02:22:34,496 --> 02:22:38,336
No no professionals are no fake robot either like

2661
02:22:38,592 --> 02:22:40,128
Alex

2662
02:22:40,384 --> 02:22:41,920
Create a robot

2663
02:22:42,176 --> 02:22:43,712
You can get even with the real gypsy

2664
02:22:45,248 --> 02:22:45,760
38

2665
02:22:46,272 --> 02:22:47,296
I should be good about that

2666
02:22:47,552 --> 02:22:48,064
I don't like you

2667
02:22:48,320 --> 02:22:48,832
Music

2668
02:22:49,344 --> 02:22:51,648
On September 10th you did talk about how the gypsies have

2669
02:22:51,904 --> 02:22:52,416
Free rein

2670
02:22:52,672 --> 02:22:57,280
Steel RVs in Europe

2671
02:22:57,792 --> 02:23:02,912
Vincent f****** reaches thing from the 1700 what are you doing talking about

2672
02:23:03,168 --> 02:23:03,936
Gypsy Wild

2673
02:23:04,448 --> 02:23:05,216
So

2674
02:23:05,728 --> 02:23:09,312
Jewel of the 27-hour 28-hour broadcast

2675
02:23:09,824 --> 02:23:11,872
It was really disappointing

2676
02:23:12,384 --> 02:23:13,664
Are they had that

2677
02:23:13,920 --> 02:23:17,760
You know Mystery Science Theater blah blah

2678
02:23:18,016 --> 02:23:19,808
Thanks for his show on on

2679
02:23:20,064 --> 02:23:21,344
The beginning of it on this

2680
02:23:21,600 --> 02:23:24,160
16th The Alex Jones Show on the 17th

2681
02:23:26,976 --> 02:23:30,560
Their reporters tag team like it Daniels did a show

2682
02:23:31,584 --> 02:23:33,376
Never never heard is a writer

2683
02:23:37,728 --> 02:23:40,800
Somebody always goes well when you put a writer guy on air

2684
02:23:41,056 --> 02:23:42,336
Some of these other guys like

2685
02:23:42,848 --> 02:23:48,992
Just people drop do the interview Leo zagami Illuminati

2686
02:23:49,248 --> 02:23:50,528
Midnight

2687
02:23:51,040 --> 02:23:53,344
A.m.

2688
02:23:53,600 --> 02:23:54,368
It was just not

2689
02:23:54,880 --> 02:23:57,696
Paul Joseph Watson

2690
02:23:57,952 --> 02:24:00,000
Doing a bunch of stuff on the office hours

2691
02:24:00,256 --> 02:24:02,560
Because he's so

2692
02:24:02,816 --> 02:24:03,584
It's again

2693
02:24:03,840 --> 02:24:05,632
You're doing an overnight thing where no one else

2694
02:24:05,888 --> 02:24:06,400
To stay up overnight

2695
02:24:09,728 --> 02:24:10,240
Look

2696
02:24:13,568 --> 02:24:14,848
Tortured slave

2697
02:24:15,104 --> 02:24:15,616
Infowars

2698
02:24:15,872 --> 02:24:19,200
More and more as time goes on.

2699
02:24:19,456 --> 02:24:20,480
He's kind of

2700
02:24:20,736 --> 02:24:23,808
Charlie Brown

2701
02:24:24,064 --> 02:24:24,576
Like

2702
02:24:24,832 --> 02:24:25,344
There's a

2703
02:24:25,600 --> 02:24:28,672
There's the football right there and robbed is about to kick it

2704
02:24:29,440 --> 02:24:31,744
Always pulled out

2705
02:24:32,000 --> 02:24:33,280
He's probably way worse

2706
02:24:33,536 --> 02:24:34,560
He appears

2707
02:24:35,072 --> 02:24:37,120
Cuz you just seem so boring

2708
02:24:37,376 --> 02:24:38,400
Is dick

2709
02:24:38,656 --> 02:24:39,936
Cuz how would you stay in this business

2710
02:24:40,192 --> 02:24:40,704
For like

2711
02:24:40,960 --> 02:24:41,984
Years that there really

2712
02:24:42,240 --> 02:24:44,032
Your point

2713
02:24:44,800 --> 02:24:47,360
Have you considered that he is actually

2714
02:24:47,616 --> 02:24:50,688
Control help

2715
02:24:51,712 --> 02:24:54,272
I think there's a decent chance there's a good person

2716
02:24:54,528 --> 02:24:55,552
Behind Rob do

2717
02:24:56,320 --> 02:24:56,832
Cutting soap

2718
02:25:00,928 --> 02:25:02,976
Specifically and only the Alex Jones

2719
02:25:03,232 --> 02:25:03,744
Portion

2720
02:25:04,000 --> 02:25:05,024
Of the Moneyball

2721
02:25:05,792 --> 02:25:07,328
What's a 16

2722
02:25:08,352 --> 02:25:10,656
Talk to you about his audience

2723
02:25:13,728 --> 02:25:16,800
To my house last night Buckley Hammond

2724
02:25:17,056 --> 02:25:19,104
Horsing

2725
02:25:19,360 --> 02:25:23,968
You're getting people to your old numbers

2726
02:25:24,224 --> 02:25:26,016
Here they are they pulled them up in front of me

2727
02:25:26,528 --> 02:25:29,088
Internal

2728
02:25:29,600 --> 02:25:30,368
Server systems

2729
02:25:30,624 --> 02:25:34,464
Infowars now reaches 41 million individual different people a month

2730
02:25:41,632 --> 02:25:42,144
Nope

2731
02:25:42,656 --> 02:25:47,008
If you count all of our social media it is several billion more

2732
02:25:49,056 --> 02:25:54,176
We did a

2733
02:25:54,432 --> 02:25:56,480
Videos

2734
02:25:56,736 --> 02:25:59,808
It's over 100

2735
02:26:04,416 --> 02:26:08,000
But it appears we're reaching upwards of a half billion

2736
02:26:08,256 --> 02:26:10,048
Vermont

2737
02:26:10,304 --> 02:26:11,328
36

2738
02:26:12,864 --> 02:26:15,680
Have some access to the internet

2739
02:26:15,936 --> 02:26:20,288
Heavy access

2740
02:26:20,544 --> 02:26:21,312
That's insane

2741
02:26:23,360 --> 02:26:24,896
What in full disclosure

2742
02:26:25,152 --> 02:26:29,760
Text out of the 7 billion people on this f****** planet

2743
02:26:30,016 --> 02:26:34,112
Have internet access

2744
02:26:34,624 --> 02:26:35,136
Three-point

2745
02:26:35,392 --> 02:26:36,416
Three-point

2746
02:26:36,672 --> 02:26:38,464
Between 3.2 and 3.6

2747
02:26:38,976 --> 02:26:40,512
Have

2748
02:26:41,280 --> 02:26:44,352
Oh okay well then solve access

2749
02:26:45,376 --> 02:26:47,936
Now here Alexander

2750
02:26:49,472 --> 02:26:53,312
700700000000

2751
02:26:57,152 --> 02:26:57,920
None of them

2752
02:27:02,784 --> 02:27:08,672
That's almost billion

2753
02:27:08,928 --> 02:27:13,024
Alex Jones

2754
02:27:13,536 --> 02:27:16,352
And s***

2755
02:27:17,632 --> 02:27:20,704
Of course not 700 million

2756
02:27:21,216 --> 02:27:23,008
Literally impossible that covers

2757
02:27:24,032 --> 02:27:25,568
He said there's six billion listening

2758
02:27:26,080 --> 02:27:26,848
Bob

2759
02:27:27,360 --> 02:27:29,408
So that 700 billion covers BX

2760
02:27:30,944 --> 02:27:37,088
No cuz you talk about the people who have access to the

2761
02:27:37,344 --> 02:27:38,112
3 billion

2762
02:27:42,208 --> 02:27:42,720
They

2763
02:27:42,976 --> 02:27:43,488
What is that

2764
02:27:44,512 --> 02:27:46,816
Social media

2765
02:27:47,328 --> 02:27:52,448
It's the same reason he says Paul Joseph Watson videos

2766
02:27:52,704 --> 02:27:54,240
Postum on

2767
02:27:54,496 --> 02:27:55,008
Facebook

2768
02:27:55,264 --> 02:27:58,336
People scroll autoplay

2769
02:27:58,848 --> 02:28:04,992
This is the same that you look at all these nonsense videos

2770
02:28:05,248 --> 02:28:07,040
Watching videos

2771
02:28:07,296 --> 02:28:07,808
2 minutes

2772
02:28:10,368 --> 02:28:13,184
For a good while I remember this from back when I was

2773
02:28:13,440 --> 02:28:13,952
Coronavirus

2774
02:28:14,720 --> 02:28:16,768
Trolling around on that dumb

2775
02:28:18,048 --> 02:28:18,560
Look it up

2776
02:28:20,864 --> 02:28:21,376
Girlfriend

2777
02:28:22,400 --> 02:28:22,912
But most

2778
02:28:23,424 --> 02:28:25,984
But he's also we have to

2779
02:28:26,240 --> 02:28:26,752
Really

2780
02:28:27,008 --> 02:28:28,032
Really have to point out

2781
02:28:28,544 --> 02:28:30,592
He's double triple and quadruple

2782
02:28:31,360 --> 02:28:35,200
There's absolutely no way cuz he's talking about the top hundred sites

2783
02:28:35,456 --> 02:28:36,224
Post-Star videos

2784
02:28:36,480 --> 02:28:37,760
Which we've already established

2785
02:28:38,016 --> 02:28:39,040
He's at like

2786
02:28:39,296 --> 02:28:39,808
What

2787
02:28:40,320 --> 02:28:41,088
He's not even in

2788
02:28:41,600 --> 02:28:42,112
The top 20

2789
02:28:42,368 --> 02:28:48,512
100 posted but you understand

2790
02:28:49,280 --> 02:28:49,792
Yes

2791
02:28:50,048 --> 02:28:53,120
If you know but as you've explained them

2792
02:28:53,376 --> 02:28:54,144
Come to me in regards to a

2793
02:28:55,168 --> 02:28:58,240
If you embed a video on your blog

2794
02:28:58,496 --> 02:28:59,008
Let's say

2795
02:28:59,264 --> 02:28:59,776
From

2796
02:29:00,032 --> 02:29:01,056
YouTube and someone

2797
02:29:01,312 --> 02:29:02,592
Who plays it from the block

2798
02:29:03,616 --> 02:29:05,152
It counts as a head

2799
02:29:05,664 --> 02:29:06,176
On YouTube

2800
02:29:06,944 --> 02:29:07,712
But if

2801
02:29:07,968 --> 02:29:08,480
There is

2802
02:29:08,992 --> 02:29:09,504
You got this

2803
02:29:10,784 --> 02:29:11,552
This blog post

2804
02:29:11,808 --> 02:29:12,832
That is about your video

2805
02:29:13,344 --> 02:29:14,880
You can count that as another hit

2806
02:29:16,416 --> 02:29:16,928
For the

2807
02:29:17,184 --> 02:29:20,000
For every single person who

2808
02:29:30,752 --> 02:29:32,032
You read because you're in

2809
02:29:32,288 --> 02:29:33,312
Avid info Warrior

2810

Newly-elected WorldNetDaily repost

2811
02:29:37,408 --> 02:29:38,432
Thirsty

2812
02:29:38,688 --> 02:29:40,736
Breitbart has in the past

2813
02:29:40,992 --> 02:29:41,760
Done

2814
02:29:42,272 --> 02:29:44,320
Reposted their links to the videos

2815
02:29:44,832 --> 02:29:45,344
How many

2816
02:29:46,624 --> 02:29:47,136
Just with

2817
02:29:47,392 --> 02:29:48,160
The emails Trump

2818
02:29:48,672 --> 02:29:49,440
Now to all of his donor

2819
02:29:53,536 --> 02:29:55,072
There was a video in bed

2820
02:29:55,328 --> 02:29:56,864
Yeah

2821
02:29:57,632 --> 02:30:03,776
There's massive manipulation going on there in terms of the audience.

2822
02:30:05,056 --> 02:30:06,592
Exactly how you want to start the money

2823
02:30:07,360 --> 02:30:07,872
Course at

2824
02:30:08,128 --> 02:30:12,992
How you want to start so we're reaching 3.5 billion people a month

2825
02:30:13,760 --> 02:30:15,296
That everyone in the world

2826
02:30:15,808 --> 02:30:16,576
Considerate

2827
02:30:17,088 --> 02:30:18,112
Think about how many children

2828
02:30:19,392 --> 02:30:20,160
Do you know what your

2829
02:30:20,672 --> 02:30:25,024
We talked about there being 7 billion people seven and a half billion people in the world

2830
02:30:25,280 --> 02:30:29,120
How many lizards are under 12 most of them most of them are just born

2831
02:30:35,264 --> 02:30:37,056
That's more than ever

2832
02:30:37,312 --> 02:30:42,176
Basically you consider the amount of

2833
02:30:42,432 --> 02:30:43,456
Considered

2834
02:30:43,712 --> 02:30:49,856
And they're not the only country that restricts the internet of course other countries that have blocked internet

2835
02:30:53,696 --> 02:30:54,976
Does numbers make no f****** sense

2836
02:30:55,232 --> 02:30:55,744
He's back

2837
02:30:56,000 --> 02:30:57,536
Way of

2838
02:30:57,792 --> 02:30:58,560
He's reaching 10

2839
02:30:59,328 --> 02:31:00,864
And one of them is me

2840
02:31:01,120 --> 02:31:04,448
Down 10%

2841
02:31:06,240 --> 02:31:10,080
He tries to sort of like couch and he's like now maybe people are

2842
02:31:10,336 --> 02:31:12,640
Coming to our site from different devices

2843
02:31:13,152 --> 02:31:15,200
So maybe we're reaching a billion

2844
02:31:15,712 --> 02:31:19,552
Even though

2845
02:31:19,808 --> 02:31:20,320
Facebook

2846
02:31:20,576 --> 02:31:21,344
Damn

2847
02:31:21,856 --> 02:31:22,880
Yeah

2848
02:31:23,136 --> 02:31:24,416
Check your Facebook on your phone

2849
02:31:26,208 --> 02:31:27,744
I think

2850
02:31:28,000 --> 02:31:30,048
You track IP addresses

2851
02:31:30,304 --> 02:31:31,584
I think that

2852
02:31:31,840 --> 02:31:37,984
Especially if you're using mobile like if you're on the bus and you check your Facebook

2853
02:31:42,336 --> 02:31:43,104
Incredibly difficult

2854
02:31:43,360 --> 02:31:45,152
The towel like exactly what your meth

2855
02:31:45,408 --> 02:31:46,944
Patrick Star

2856
02:31:47,712 --> 02:31:53,856
He's not doing legit work in terms of statistics

2857
02:31:54,112 --> 02:31:54,624
Open

2858
02:31:54,880 --> 02:31:55,392
I love it

2859
02:31:58,464 --> 02:32:04,608
After that we'll there's no there's no arguing with Matt but all of this other stuff

2860
02:32:04,864 --> 02:32:07,936
We can deal with reality versus non reality

2861
02:32:08,192 --> 02:32:10,240
And there is a question there and there are

2862
02:32:10,752 --> 02:32:12,800
The truth it is

2863
02:32:13,056 --> 02:32:14,080
Pure Analytics

2864
02:32:14,848 --> 02:32:15,616
You're lying

2865
02:32:18,944 --> 02:32:22,784
Yeah I got the clip and where you goes from there is talk about how like

2866
02:32:24,320 --> 02:32:27,392
I'm humbled that I'm talking to

2867
02:32:27,904 --> 02:32:31,488
Do you know you're lying what's going on here

2868
02:32:31,744 --> 02:32:35,072
Humility that's really fast

2869
02:32:35,840 --> 02:32:36,864
But

2870
02:32:37,120 --> 02:32:38,656
There's no possible way

2871
02:32:39,424 --> 02:32:39,936
Alex

2872
02:32:40,192 --> 02:32:43,008
Beyond his b******* about his audience eyes yes Mother

2873
02:32:43,264 --> 02:32:44,544
Things you want to talk about on the money about

2874
02:32:47,872 --> 02:32:48,384
Jordan

2875
02:32:48,640 --> 02:32:49,664
I've said a lot of things

2876
02:32:49,920 --> 02:32:50,944
Are not true that I

2877
02:32:57,088 --> 02:32:59,648
Astronomical it's maybe three and a half billion things

2878
02:32:59,904 --> 02:33:00,928
You get you upset or not true

2879
02:33:01,184 --> 02:33:04,256
Not true

2880
02:33:04,512 --> 02:33:06,304
I don't like that one scared

2881
02:33:12,960 --> 02:33:15,776
Never never

2882
02:33:17,056 --> 02:33:18,336
Rareform

2883
02:33:19,360 --> 02:33:21,152
Cuz you got that 40 in my heart that

2884
02:33:27,808 --> 02:33:30,112
Starbucks

2885
02:33:30,624 --> 02:33:32,672
I'll be just fine until all this comes true

2886
02:33:36,256 --> 02:33:39,840
I want to I want to I want to go back there tonight

2887
02:33:40,096 --> 02:33:41,632
It's screwed everything up I apologize

2888
02:33:44,960 --> 02:33:47,008
I'll be just fine until all this comes true

2889
02:33:50,336 --> 02:33:51,360
Criticism is

2890
02:33:54,944 --> 02:33:59,296
Go to level and put everything on the table

2891
02:34:02,368 --> 02:34:04,160
The end of the West

2892
02:34:09,536 --> 02:34:10,304
Now it's not

2893
02:34:11,072 --> 02:34:11,584
But

2894
02:34:13,888 --> 02:34:14,400
What

2895
02:34:15,680 --> 02:34:16,448
George Soros

2896
02:34:16,960 --> 02:34:18,240
Is he hanging out with

2897
02:34:18,496 --> 02:34:19,008
What

2898
02:34:19,520 --> 02:34:20,032
What

2899
02:34:20,288 --> 02:34:21,568
Okay you believe

2900
02:34:21,824 --> 02:34:22,848
Global

2901
02:34:23,360 --> 02:34:24,384
AR

2902
02:34:24,640 --> 02:34:25,408
Demonic

2903
02:34:26,944 --> 02:34:28,992
Beings from a different dimension

2904
02:34:29,248 --> 02:34:33,344
Rich if you see one

2905
02:34:33,600 --> 02:34:35,136
Skillet

2906
02:34:35,392 --> 02:34:36,672
Why would you

2907
02:34:36,928 --> 02:34:40,768
What would you have like a

2908
02:34:41,280 --> 02:34:44,096
Hey listen I know you're a demonic monster

2909
02:34:44,352 --> 02:34:46,144
Hell-bent on destroying Humanity

2910
02:34:46,400 --> 02:34:51,776
But come on you got to leave juicy inside tips for me like a MySpace

2911
02:34:54,080 --> 02:34:58,688
That's right cuz that's what he's talking about

2912
02:34:58,944 --> 02:34:59,456
Keep on

2913
02:34:59,968 --> 02:35:00,992
Keep on your ears

2914
02:35:01,248 --> 02:35:05,088
Well know this goes back to what we were

2915
02:35:05,344 --> 02:35:10,720
You better get out this goes back to what we were talking about at the beginning of this episode of the internet

2916
02:35:10,976 --> 02:35:11,488
Version

2917
02:35:11,744 --> 02:35:12,768
The elite

2918
02:35:13,280 --> 02:35:14,560
And the Illuminati

2919
02:35:14,816 --> 02:35:17,888
They need to have everyone know what they're doing

2920
02:35:18,144 --> 02:35:24,288
At work idea

2921
02:35:24,544 --> 02:35:25,568
Do anything you can say

2922
02:35:26,080 --> 02:35:27,616
Big either using Alex

2923
02:35:28,384 --> 02:35:29,920
Conduit to tell people

2924
02:35:30,176 --> 02:35:33,248
What they're doing to them and if they don't fight back

2925
02:35:33,760 --> 02:35:35,040
Then whatever

2926
02:35:35,296 --> 02:35:41,440
F****** believe what's magical about that entire line of argument

2927
02:35:46,560 --> 02:35:48,352
I guess if I don't really support him

2928
02:35:48,608 --> 02:35:51,424
Then being destroyed

2929
02:35:53,472 --> 02:35:54,240
Really

2930
02:35:56,800 --> 02:35:58,592
Brilliant

2931
02:35:58,848 --> 02:35:59,872
I don't think you could

2932
02:36:01,920 --> 02:36:02,944
To be able to articulate

2933
02:36:03,200 --> 02:36:03,968
Exactly what

2934
02:36:04,224 --> 02:36:04,992
Lineup

2935
02:36:05,248 --> 02:36:09,344
That trains

2936
02:36:09,600 --> 02:36:11,392
Sixth Sense

2937
02:36:15,488 --> 02:36:17,280
It's not that these people are all insane

2938
02:36:17,536 --> 02:36:18,304
And it's at their tariff

2939
02:36:18,560 --> 02:36:19,328
I don't know

2940
02:36:19,840 --> 02:36:24,704
I spend a lot of periods of my life in various stages of paranoia

2941
02:36:25,216 --> 02:36:25,984
Xiety

2942
02:36:26,240 --> 02:36:28,288
I have mental illness I've done a lot of drugs

2943
02:36:28,544 --> 02:36:30,592
In the past until I know weird

2944
02:36:31,104 --> 02:36:32,384
Yeah and I can sort of

2945
02:36:32,640 --> 02:36:35,712
I can suss out where things are coming from right

2946
02:36:38,016 --> 02:36:39,296
I don't I don't mean to put two

2947
02:36:43,136 --> 02:36:43,904
These conspiracy

2948
02:36:44,160 --> 02:36:44,672
The Forum

2949
02:36:44,928 --> 02:36:46,208
These weird

2950
02:36:46,464 --> 02:36:49,536
Illuminati forums these message board

2951
02:36:49,792 --> 02:36:52,608
Like I've read all this stuff that people talk about

2952
02:36:52,864 --> 02:36:54,144
And none of it's based on

2953
02:36:54,656 --> 02:36:56,704
It's so much of it is mirrored in what

2954
02:36:57,728 --> 02:36:59,264
The Lesser Magic

2955
02:37:00,544 --> 02:37:01,056
We've got it

2956
02:37:02,080 --> 02:37:03,360
Then you're in

2957
02:37:04,128 --> 02:37:04,896
Its soda

2958
02:37:05,664 --> 02:37:06,944
It's So based on nothing

2959
02:37:09,248 --> 02:37:10,784
And that's what he's doing it's great

2960
02:37:11,040 --> 02:37:12,832
I love it

2961
02:37:14,880 --> 02:37:15,648

The join up I got you there

Mythology

2968
02:37:43,040 --> 02:37:44,576
Easiest b******* like

2969
02:37:44,832 --> 02:37:47,648
We need to be more like Prometheus who God loves

2970
02:37:47,904 --> 02:37:51,232
Like wait hold on one second

2971
02:37:52,000 --> 02:37:54,048
Oh I did

2972
02:37:54,560 --> 02:37:55,072

To the elite

2975
02:37:59,168 --> 02:38:00,960
Version that I would be into

2976
02:38:01,216 --> 02:38:04,032

Just bring us the fire then got his liver pecked out

2978
02:38:10,688 --> 02:38:15,552
He makes for Humanity

2979
02:38:16,320 --> 02:38:18,368
Is it that the God that I would worship

2980
02:38:18,624 --> 02:38:19,904
Is the one that builds us up

2981
02:38:20,160 --> 02:38:21,696
Cuz Prometheus give us fire

2982
02:38:21,952 --> 02:38:22,976
Gave us.

2983
02:38:25,280 --> 02:38:25,792
No

2984
02:38:26,048 --> 02:38:27,328
Multiplayer

2985
02:38:30,400 --> 02:38:32,192
We have a lot of Christian knowledge

2986
02:38:32,704 --> 02:38:35,520
It's like we do

2987
02:38:36,032 --> 02:38:37,056
If you do God bless

2988
02:38:37,312 --> 02:38:41,408
I don't care I don't

2989
02:38:45,760 --> 02:38:46,784
No comment

02:38:47,552 --> 02:38:51,648
So this next clip his bulshit for

2991
02:38:53,184 --> 02:38:53,696
Ever

2992
02:38:54,976 --> 02:38:56,768
These liberals want to kill cops

2993
02:38:57,024 --> 02:38:58,304
Yes

2994
02:39:00,608 --> 02:39:01,888
Okay

2995
02:39:02,656 --> 02:39:04,704
You have an interview with this guy named

2996
02:39:04,960 --> 02:39:06,240
James Wesley Rawles

2997
02:39:06,752 --> 02:39:07,776
Runza

2998
02:39:08,032 --> 02:39:08,544
Rate name

2999
02:39:12,128 --> 02:39:15,456
Yeah I would totally be serial killer

3000
02:39:20,064 --> 02:39:20,832
Serial killer

3001
02:39:22,112 --> 02:39:28,256
Like his own serial killer I think it's a lot of prepping enough

3002
02:39:29,280 --> 02:39:33,888
Here's a step-by-step don't piss me off

3003
02:39:35,168 --> 02:39:37,472
He is a guy who used to come on on

3004
02:39:37,728 --> 02:39:39,264
On Skype and basements on Rhode Island

3005
02:39:39,520 --> 02:39:40,032
Just told us

3006
02:39:40,288 --> 02:39:44,384
Used to come on on Skype now you don't even want your picture out there cuz you're so freaked

3007
02:39:44,896 --> 02:39:45,664
Too much

3008
02:39:46,176 --> 02:39:46,944
Gobs

3009
02:39:47,200 --> 02:39:48,992
Most of the show with an interview with this

3010
02:39:49,760 --> 02:39:53,088
Let me get into talking about cop killing rhetoric

3011
02:39:53,344 --> 02:39:54,880
What have you here use that

3012
02:39:55,904 --> 02:40:00,256
It is a paradox

3013
02:40:00,512 --> 02:40:01,792
We still put up with it

3014
02:40:02,560 --> 02:40:04,864
U-Haul Westchester out chilling

3015
02:40:05,120 --> 02:40:08,960
So they're so fired up once

3016
02:40:09,216 --> 02:40:11,520
I wish there was some sophistication out there

3017
02:40:11,776 --> 02:40:14,080
Everyone not be played like fiddles

3018
02:40:19,712 --> 02:40:20,736
Where

3019
02:40:22,016 --> 02:40:22,784
Radical

3020
02:40:23,040 --> 02:40:24,576
Rrb

3021
02:40:24,832 --> 02:40:27,904
Towards

3022
02:40:34,816 --> 02:40:35,840
Dispensary

3023
02:40:40,960 --> 02:40:42,240
Steve

3024
02:40:48,128 --> 02:40:50,688
Nation

3025
02:41:02,720 --> 02:41:05,536
NWA in 1988

3026
02:41:07,584 --> 02:41:10,400
Body count cop killer in 1992

3027
02:41:10,656 --> 02:41:13,216
How many times

3028
02:41:13,472 --> 02:41:14,240
This happen

3029
02:41:14,496 --> 02:41:15,264
Boba tea

3030
02:41:15,520 --> 02:41:21,664
911 is a joke came out in 1990 that wasn't cop killing

3031
02:41:21,920 --> 02:41:22,688
Always come with us

3032
02:41:23,200 --> 02:41:24,736
I've never heard this s***

3033
02:41:24,992 --> 02:41:27,552
When did they start

3034
02:41:30,880 --> 02:41:31,648
Why not community

3035
02:41:31,904 --> 02:41:32,928
That's really

3036
02:41:33,184 --> 02:41:37,280
Like when we talked about like feminism and racism in these sorts of things

3037
02:41:37,536 --> 02:41:40,096
And how blind Alex's do so many

3038
02:41:42,400 --> 02:41:45,216
A lot of it really does boil down in some ways to like

3039
02:41:45,728 --> 02:41:46,240
You're not listening

3040
02:41:47,008 --> 02:41:48,032
Well you're not listen

3041
02:41:50,336 --> 02:41:52,896
The larger Avenue is just that

3042
02:41:53,408 --> 02:41:53,920
Nobody was

3043
02:41:54,432 --> 02:41:54,944
Nobody

3044
02:41:55,200 --> 02:41:56,480
In your world

3045
02:41:59,040 --> 02:42:01,344
That wasn't like if you go back to the 80

3046
02:42:02,880 --> 02:42:04,160
See all those local news

3047
02:42:05,952 --> 02:42:09,536
Is out of control like all of those different

3048
02:42:09,792 --> 02:42:13,632
Never

3049
02:42:13,888 --> 02:42:17,728
Now let's take like reality out of it and sensible

3050
02:42:17,984 --> 02:42:19,008
Discourse out

3051
02:42:19,264 --> 02:42:20,544
Let's just remove that first

3052
02:42:21,056 --> 02:42:24,640
Which is how many people

3053
02:42:24,896 --> 02:42:26,944
We're f****** talking about taking out the police

3054
02:42:27,200 --> 02:42:27,968
After the Rodney King

3055
02:42:28,480 --> 02:42:28,992
So

3056
02:42:29,504 --> 02:42:30,528
And that was not in the six

3057
02:42:31,808 --> 02:42:34,624
Is just

3058
02:42:34,880 --> 02:42:36,672
Very clear example

3059
02:42:38,464 --> 02:42:39,744
Talking James Wesley Rawles

3060
02:42:40,000 --> 02:42:40,768
He's an idiot

3061
02:42:41,280 --> 02:42:43,584
Music f****** historical

3062
02:42:45,888 --> 02:42:46,400
And I want

3063
02:42:47,424 --> 02:42:47,936
You got a Blog

3064
02:42:48,448 --> 02:42:48,960
That's pretty cool

3065
02:42:49,216 --> 02:42:49,728
Goddamn

3066
02:42:50,752 --> 02:42:54,080
So naughty

3067
02:42:57,152 --> 02:42:59,200
Arguments that he's making within this

3068
02:42:59,456 --> 02:42:59,968
Interview

3069
02:43:00,480 --> 02:43:02,016
Is that the global

3070
02:43:02,272 --> 02:43:05,088
Created radical Islam in order

3071
02:43:06,112 --> 02:43:07,904
Logic like they're fighting

3072
02:43:08,160 --> 02:43:09,184
Cuz I needed a better anime

3073
02:43:09,440 --> 02:43:10,208
Controlled opposition

3074
02:43:16,608 --> 02:43:20,704
Our freedoms created one world religion

3075
02:43:22,496 --> 02:43:25,312
One World Government

3076
02:43:25,568 --> 02:43:29,920
It doubled back into the ship that Alex talks about

3077
02:43:30,176 --> 02:43:31,200
Your radicalizing

3078
02:43:31,712 --> 02:43:33,760
The enemies that you are imagining

3079
02:43:34,016 --> 02:43:34,784
In order to jump

3080
02:43:35,040 --> 02:43:35,808
Sayori

3081
02:43:38,368 --> 02:43:38,880
Coronavirus

3082
02:43:39,136 --> 02:43:39,648
In his

3083
02:43:39,904 --> 02:43:42,720
Is this like this is the f****** money bomb

3084
02:43:43,744 --> 02:43:47,840
Most of the show this is the money but most of the show

3085
02:43:48,352 --> 02:43:51,168
Fear beer and money

3086
02:43:51,424 --> 02:43:54,496
Fear fear and we are much more numerous

3087
02:43:54,752 --> 02:43:55,264
Then you think

3088
02:43:55,776 --> 02:43:57,568
You are not alone it's all about

3089
02:43:57,824 --> 02:43:59,104
3.5 billion

3090
02:44:00,128 --> 02:44:03,712
Don't feel bad because you're just one of them

3091
02:44:03,968 --> 02:44:07,552
It's like it's like on a buster has a dollar bill already in

3092
02:44:07,808 --> 02:44:10,624
His hat whenever he pulls it up priming the pot

3093
02:44:12,672 --> 02:44:18,816
Okay 3.5 billion people behind the only ones fighting

3094
02:44:19,072 --> 02:44:20,352
Global

3095
02:44:21,632 --> 02:44:22,400
Before

3096
02:44:23,424 --> 02:44:24,960
Rawls gets out

3097
02:44:26,240 --> 02:44:26,752
How much money

3098
02:44:28,544 --> 02:44:29,056
Did he actually

3099
02:44:35,200 --> 02:44:35,712
Yeah

3100
02:44:36,224 --> 02:44:36,992
Oh man

3101
02:44:37,248 --> 02:44:38,272
Are considering

3102
02:44:38,784 --> 02:44:41,856
Insane markup he has on these products

3103
02:44:42,112 --> 02:44:48,256
Even when they're on sale which I didn't even mean to bring up but let's f****** talk about it

3104
02:44:53,632 --> 02:44:56,448
For sale

3105
02:44:56,704 --> 02:44:57,984
Italy talking about like

3106
02:44:58,240 --> 02:45:04,128
All right that's on sale until the show is over got free shipping on everything

3107
02:45:06,688 --> 02:45:07,456
Cost

3108
02:45:07,968 --> 02:45:08,480
Yeah just like

3109
02:45:08,736 --> 02:45:09,504
Got to move it

3110
02:45:09,760 --> 02:45:14,624
That sort of thing on it

3111
02:45:15,136 --> 02:45:15,904
Which is b*******

3112
02:45:16,160 --> 02:45:19,232
If you if you are looking

3113
02:45:19,488 --> 02:45:20,512
King at the end of

3114
02:45:20,768 --> 02:45:21,792
The fiscal year though

3115
02:45:22,048 --> 02:45:28,192
Just because otherwise otherwise

3116
02:45:29,216 --> 02:45:30,752
It's still money you have

3117
02:45:31,008 --> 02:45:37,152
And it's not like that stuff you bought isn't going to factory

3118
02:45:37,408 --> 02:45:39,712
Books and sell it for no profit

3119
02:45:40,224 --> 02:45:45,856
Which might I don't know when we got into business I don't know I don't have it

3120
02:45:46,112 --> 02:45:51,744
Might still be like it might be indicative of the fact

3121
02:45:52,000 --> 02:45:54,048
Maybe overbought

3122
02:45:55,584 --> 02:45:56,352
He's in a hole

3123
02:45:58,144 --> 02:45:58,656
I don't know

3124
02:45:58,912 --> 02:45:59,936
Anyway

3125
02:46:00,192 --> 02:46:00,704
Ross

3126
02:46:00,960 --> 02:46:01,728
Before he gets out

3127
02:46:02,240 --> 02:46:03,519
The episode

3128
02:46:03,775 --> 02:46:05,055
Hamster say

3129
02:46:05,311 --> 02:46:06,335
Scariest things

3130
02:46:06,591 --> 02:46:08,639
I've heard a guest today on Alex Jones

3131
02:46:08,895 --> 02:46:09,663
Hellboy

3132
02:46:09,919 --> 02:46:12,991
There's going to be huge numbers of Christian refugees

3133
02:46:16,831 --> 02:46:20,927
That there is actually a need for a new Homeland Nation

3134
02:46:21,183 --> 02:46:22,463
Persecuted

3135
02:46:22,975 --> 02:46:25,279
Christian

3136
02:46:25,535 --> 02:46:27,071
Refugees

3137
02:46:27,839 --> 02:46:30,655
Numbers in the years to come

3138
02:46:30,911 --> 02:46:32,447
That's why I decided to

3139
02:46:32,959 --> 02:46:35,775
Siri

3140
02:46:37,823 --> 02:46:42,175
Call Land Of Promise describe the establishment of a Christian Nation

3141
02:46:42,687 --> 02:46:45,759
And I also made it

3142
02:46:46,271 --> 02:46:49,599
Christian libertarian

3143
02:46:51,903 --> 02:46:53,439
Read pray

3144
02:46:56,255 --> 02:46:57,535
A Safe Haven

3145
02:46:58,047 --> 02:47:00,095
For persecuted Christians all over the world

3146
02:47:00,607 --> 02:47:02,399
Argue that most of the time when

3147
02:47:02,655 --> 02:47:03,167
Religious

3148
02:47:03,679 --> 02:47:05,471
Pacific countries have been created heaven

3149
02:47:06,495 --> 02:47:07,519
How

3150
02:47:09,055 --> 02:47:09,823
Here there though

3151
02:47:10,079 --> 02:47:10,591
Is that

3152
02:47:10,847 --> 02:47:11,359
You saying

3153
02:47:11,615 --> 02:47:12,383
So many Christian

3154
02:47:12,639 --> 02:47:13,151
Refugees

3155
02:47:13,407 --> 02:47:14,431
Homeland

3156
02:47:15,711 --> 02:47:16,735
We're creating

3157
02:47:17,247 --> 02:47:18,015
Counter Cafe

3158
02:47:18,783 --> 02:47:23,135
Which is like what is the name of his novel

3159
02:47:23,391 --> 02:47:24,415
But the point being

3160
02:47:24,927 --> 02:47:25,439
We

3161
02:47:26,463 --> 02:47:27,487
That is persecuted

3162
02:47:27,999 --> 02:47:29,023
So let's make

3163
02:47:29,279 --> 02:47:30,815
Exactly that

3164
02:47:31,071 --> 02:47:32,863
What are burrs

3165
02:47:33,119 --> 02:47:34,399
That's instinct

3166
02:47:34,655 --> 02:47:36,191
That mentality pervades

3167
02:47:42,335 --> 02:47:43,615
Well and frankly this is

3168
02:47:43,871 --> 02:47:44,383
This is what we've been to

3169
02:47:45,151 --> 02:47:45,663
4 months

3170
02:47:46,175 --> 02:47:48,735
Forever

3171
02:47:49,247 --> 02:47:49,759
Surprise me

3172
02:47:50,015 --> 02:47:50,783
The people don't

3173
02:47:52,831 --> 02:47:53,599
One f******

3174
02:47:53,855 --> 02:47:54,623
2nd and think

3175
02:47:55,135 --> 02:47:55,903
Oh well this is

3176
02:47:56,159 --> 02:47:57,951
Thing is bad to lift

3177
02:47:58,719 --> 02:48:00,511
Because they have this

3178
02:48:02,047 --> 02:48:04,863
But then again then again you know what

3179
02:48:06,655 --> 02:48:07,935
Every every Democrat

3180
02:48:08,447 --> 02:48:11,007
Said when they go low we go high

3181
02:48:11,263 --> 02:48:17,407
Like Mark DeRosa

3182
02:48:17,663 --> 02:48:20,479
Walking friend of the show and I were having

3183
02:48:20,735 --> 02:48:21,247
This conversation

3184
02:48:22,271 --> 02:48:27,391
We all said when they go low we go high and now we're kind of at the position where

3185
02:48:28,159 --> 02:48:32,767
When they go low you f****** go goddamn

3186
02:48:33,023 --> 02:48:35,839
I don't know

3187
02:48:37,119 --> 02:48:43,263
Don't know.

3188
02:48:43,519 --> 02:48:45,055
Like we need our up

3189
02:48:45,311 --> 02:48:49,919
Okay so the rest of us

3190
02:48:50,175 --> 02:48:50,943
September

3191
02:48:51,199 --> 02:48:52,479
16th show for the money

3192
02:48:54,783 --> 02:48:57,087
I do think he's right there

3193
02:48:57,343 --> 02:48:57,855
A lot of

3194
02:48:58,367 --> 02:48:58,879
Should refugees

3195
02:48:59,391 --> 02:49:00,671
In the same way that there will be

3196
02:49:00,927 --> 02:49:01,439
A lot of rep

3197
02:49:01,951 --> 02:49:02,719
Total.

3198
02:49:02,975 --> 02:49:04,511
Immediately following like

3199
02:49:04,767 --> 02:49:05,791
Considering the effects

3200
02:49:06,047 --> 02:49:06,559
Climate change

3201
02:49:06,815 --> 02:49:08,351
What does happen

3202
02:49:08,607 --> 02:49:09,375
In our country inn

3203
02:49:09,631 --> 02:49:10,143
Specific

3204
02:49:10,911 --> 02:49:13,215
So right now we have a s*** ton of

3205
02:49:13,471 --> 02:49:13,983
Muslim

3206
02:49:14,751 --> 02:49:15,519
From Aldi

3207
02:49:16,799 --> 02:49:20,895
It's not my almost

3208
02:49:23,199 --> 02:49:23,967
Fuller up in arms

3209
02:49:25,503 --> 02:49:26,527
When we just start talking

3210
02:49:26,783 --> 02:49:27,551
About refugees

3211
02:49:28,063 --> 02:49:29,087
With no religion

3212
02:49:32,415 --> 02:49:33,183
How many all of these

3213
02:49:33,439 --> 02:49:38,047
Everyone's going to scapegoat depending on the adjectives that is part of the refugee

3214
02:49:38,303 --> 02:49:41,887
Parked exactly how many how many Christian ref

3215
02:49:42,143 --> 02:49:43,679
What's the number before

3216
02:49:44,959 --> 02:49:45,727
Well we don't want it

3217
02:49:45,983 --> 02:49:48,799
Anymore retrokits a part of

3218
02:49:49,567 --> 02:49:51,871
Complaining about refugees.

3219
02:49:52,383 --> 02:49:53,919
Because

3220
02:49:54,175 --> 02:49:55,455
Well you deny climate

3221
02:49:55,711 --> 02:50:00,319
Exactly it's a fun game play it's a fun fun game

3222
02:50:00,575 --> 02:50:01,343
What's the number

3223
02:50:02,111 --> 02:50:03,391
Like how many

3224
02:50:04,159 --> 02:50:05,183
For fucksake

3225
02:50:05,439 --> 02:50:06,207
Imagine

3226
02:50:06,463 --> 02:50:07,999
We're talking about Rome

3227
02:50:08,511 --> 02:50:09,791
All of the Catholics

3228
02:50:10,559 --> 02:50:12,351
For whatever reason

3229
02:50:13,375 --> 02:50:14,655
How many how many

3230
02:50:16,703 --> 02:50:17,215
Before

3231
02:50:17,471 --> 02:50:18,239
It starts going like

3232
02:50:18,495 --> 02:50:19,775
Well we can't allow any

3233
02:50:20,287 --> 02:50:21,823
Regardless of religion

3234
02:50:22,079 --> 02:50:28,223
Let's imagine this may not be the case

3235
02:50:28,479 --> 02:50:30,015
I'm not saying it necessarily is

3236
02:50:30,271 --> 02:50:34,623
But let's imagine a scenario where Muslim

3237
02:50:34,879 --> 02:50:36,415
Dominated countries

3238
02:50:36,927 --> 02:50:39,999
Happened to be the places that are safer from climate change

3239
02:50:40,255 --> 02:50:46,399
Imagine like Saudi Arabia is unaffected by climate change

3240
02:50:46,911 --> 02:50:47,935
And now these cats

3241
02:50:48,191 --> 02:50:49,727
Six-letter displaced rib

3242
02:50:49,983 --> 02:50:54,847
Wonderful

3243
02:50:55,103 --> 02:50:58,175
The Catholic

3244
02:50:58,431 --> 02:50:59,711
From the south of Italy

3245
02:51:01,759 --> 02:51:04,319
Right place

3246
02:51:04,575 --> 02:51:08,671
So now they have to go somewhere and they go into Saudi Arabia

3247
02:51:08,927 --> 02:51:10,463
Saudi Arabia

3248
02:51:10,975 --> 02:51:14,815
I mean let's not unpack all of their negative cultural problem

3249
02:51:15,071 --> 02:51:20,959
Let's talk about that

3250
02:51:21,215 --> 02:51:23,519
These Catholics come in want to change everything

3251
02:51:25,567 --> 02:51:26,591
How

3252
02:51:26,847 --> 02:51:27,615
How is it the

3253
02:51:27,871 --> 02:51:28,895
People can't do that neck

3254
02:51:31,199 --> 02:51:32,479
Like think about that

3255
02:51:32,735 --> 02:51:35,039
Caught up in their identity

3256
02:51:35,551 --> 02:51:36,319
Yeah that's probably

3257
02:51:36,575 --> 02:51:39,391
That's why whenever we talk about Alex Jones I don't like

3258
02:51:40,415 --> 02:51:40,927
Supremacist

3259
02:51:41,183 --> 02:51:43,999
I like to say that you caught up in white identity

3260
02:51:44,255 --> 02:51:47,839
White Christian male identity is more

3261
02:51:48,095 --> 02:51:50,143
To the point than saying is a white supremacist

3262
02:51:50,655 --> 02:51:53,471
It's way too easy to say that like he thinks he's better than ever

3263
02:51:53,983 --> 02:51:55,263
But

3264
02:51:55,775 --> 02:51:57,823
What really motivates him is

3265
02:51:58,079 --> 02:52:03,199
His identification with what makes him white what makes him male what makes

3266
02:52:03,455 --> 02:52:04,223
Christian

3267
02:52:06,015 --> 02:52:07,295
That threat

3268
02:52:07,551 --> 02:52:10,623
Opening to a lot of people to imagine a world where is

3269
02:52:10,879 --> 02:52:13,439
Problematic

3270
02:52:13,951 --> 02:52:17,023
Because becomes threatening

3271
02:52:17,279 --> 02:52:20,351
Right like I meant is that because

3272
02:52:20,607 --> 02:52:21,119
The demographics

3273
02:52:22,143 --> 02:52:23,423
All the sudden they have the

3274
02:52:23,679 --> 02:52:24,191
Thought

3275
02:52:24,703 --> 02:52:25,215
Wait

3276
02:52:25,471 --> 02:52:26,495
Maybe they start sink

3277
02:52:26,751 --> 02:52:28,543
What we think about them about us

3278
02:52:28,799 --> 02:52:29,567
Ramen to say

3279
02:52:29,823 --> 02:52:30,847
Already really in

3280
02:52:31,103 --> 02:52:31,615
Interesting

3281
02:52:31,871 --> 02:52:32,895
Assessment of

3282
02:52:34,687 --> 02:52:35,199
A lot of

3283
02:52:35,455 --> 02:52:38,783
Someone was pointing out that a lot of homophobia is based on

3284
02:52:39,039 --> 02:52:40,319
A sphere

3285
02:52:41,087 --> 02:52:41,599
Bye

3286
02:52:41,855 --> 02:52:42,367
Really

3287
02:52:43,135 --> 02:52:44,671
Aggressive angry dudes

3288
02:52:45,439 --> 02:52:47,487
That men will treat them like they

3289
02:52:47,743 --> 02:52:48,255
Women

3290
02:52:49,279 --> 02:52:51,327
And I think there is a bit of that

3291
02:52:52,607 --> 02:52:53,119
Really

3292
02:52:53,631 --> 02:52:56,703
I think there's a lot of that in

3293
02:52:57,983 --> 02:52:58,751
Alex is afraid

3294
02:52:59,263 --> 02:53:02,335
The minorities will treat him how he thinks

3295
02:53:02,591 --> 02:53:04,127
About them

3296
02:53:04,383 --> 02:53:07,967
Yeah crimes coming back

3297
02:53:15,903 --> 02:53:17,695
The thing that I have always

3298
02:53:17,951 --> 02:53:18,463
Considered

3299
02:53:19,743 --> 02:53:20,767
And it is

3300
02:53:21,023 --> 02:53:22,303
One of the things in the later stages

3301
02:53:23,071 --> 02:53:23,839
Obama's

3302
02:53:25,119 --> 02:53:25,887
That I was

3303
02:53:26,143 --> 02:53:26,655
Concerned about is

3304
02:53:26,911 --> 02:53:27,679
Because of that

3305
02:53:27,935 --> 02:53:28,703
Executive over

3306
02:53:29,471 --> 02:53:30,751
Because of how much power we go

3307
02:53:31,007 --> 02:53:31,519
Gave Obama

3308
02:53:32,031 --> 02:53:32,799
Trump now

3309
02:53:34,079 --> 02:53:34,591
Like they just

3310
02:53:34,847 --> 02:53:36,639
Never we never considered

3311
02:53:36,895 --> 02:53:39,455
That's not true

3312
02:53:39,967 --> 02:53:40,479
In the

3313
02:53:40,735 --> 02:53:42,271
I mean I agree with the point but it's

3314
02:53:42,527 --> 02:53:44,575
When's that was happening

3315
02:53:44,831 --> 02:53:46,623
Executive power was given to Obama

3316
02:53:47,135 --> 02:53:48,415
There were people

3317
02:53:48,671 --> 02:53:49,439
Such as myself

3318
02:53:49,695 --> 02:53:50,463
And other folks

3319
02:53:50,719 --> 02:53:52,255
You as well

3320
02:53:52,511 --> 02:53:53,535
This is not good

3321
02:53:54,303 --> 02:53:56,351
There should not be like

3322
02:53:56,607 --> 02:53:57,631
Domenico's back to Bush

3323
02:53:57,887 --> 02:54:04,031
The idea of being able to unilaterally launch war is not in the power

3324
02:54:04,543 --> 02:54:06,335
Executive branch

3325
02:54:06,591 --> 02:54:08,639
Even with Obama in power

3326
02:54:09,151 --> 02:54:09,663
I know

3327
02:54:09,919 --> 02:54:10,431
Hun

3328
02:54:10,943 --> 02:54:11,455
Of Democrats

3329
02:54:16,319 --> 02:54:17,087
It wasn't enough

3330
02:54:17,343 --> 02:54:17,855
2

3331
02:54:19,903 --> 02:54:20,415
Congress

3332
02:54:20,671 --> 02:54:22,463
Yeah

3333
02:54:23,743 --> 02:54:25,791
Imagine

3334
02:54:27,327 --> 02:54:28,095
Yeah no

3335
02:54:28,351 --> 02:54:28,863
I'm out

3336
02:54:32,191 --> 02:54:34,239
It's political opportunism by

3337
02:54:35,519 --> 02:54:36,031
I mean

3338
02:54:36,543 --> 02:54:38,335
If we keep this conversation going more than

3339
02:54:38,591 --> 02:54:39,103
10 minutes

3340
02:54:39,359 --> 02:54:40,127
We're going

3341
02:54:40,383 --> 02:54:46,527
Overthrow Appleton

3342
02:54:46,783 --> 02:54:50,111
Little do you know I'm already there but

3343
02:54:50,367 --> 02:54:51,391
Don't reveal that

3344
02:54:51,647 --> 02:54:53,695
So

3345
02:54:54,975 --> 02:54:57,279
September 16th I'm the revolution

3346
02:54:57,535 --> 02:54:58,303
Senor the one

3347
02:54:58,559 --> 02:54:59,327
Kiefer that's legitimate

3348
02:54:59,583 --> 02:55:00,863
Part 1 of the money

3349
02:55:01,119 --> 02:55:03,679
Rhymes with a long interview

3350
02:55:03,935 --> 02:55:05,727
Doctor group runs the 4th hour

3351
02:55:07,007 --> 02:55:09,311
The show before they handed off to whoever dumbass

3352
02:55:13,663 --> 02:55:15,199
He's just trying to sell a lot of product

3353
02:55:15,455 --> 02:55:16,991
She does a bunch of bulshit

3354
02:55:17,247 --> 02:55:21,599
But before he leaves leaves he says that his predictions

3355
02:55:22,111 --> 02:55:24,159
Have never been wrong he's basically a psychic

3356
02:55:24,671 --> 02:55:26,719
Young and that his sixpence

3357
02:55:27,231 --> 02:55:30,047
Is on fire like never before race

3358
02:55:31,071 --> 02:55:31,839
Life expenses

3359
02:55:32,095 --> 02:55:32,863
Is it on fire like

3360
02:55:33,119 --> 02:55:33,887
It's never been before

3361
02:55:37,215 --> 02:55:39,263
There I think that you are freaked out

3362
02:55:39,519 --> 02:55:40,031
Certainly

3363
02:55:40,799 --> 02:55:42,591
This quote

3364
02:55:42,847 --> 02:55:44,639
That I thought was really f****** awesome

3365
02:55:44,895 --> 02:55:45,407
I was

3366
02:55:45,663 --> 02:55:48,991
If you're nouveau-riche and you're not giving us money

3367
02:55:49,247 --> 02:55:49,759
Or

3368
02:55:50,015 --> 02:55:53,087
There's a long list of things basically there's about giving him

3369
02:55:53,343 --> 02:55:55,391
Impress a billboard

3370
02:55:55,647 --> 02:55:56,415
Yeah

3371
02:55:56,671 --> 02:55:57,439
You're crazy

3372
02:55:58,975 --> 02:56:00,767
If your nouveau-riche

3373
02:56:01,279 --> 02:56:02,815
Is that why you phrases like alright

3374
02:56:03,071 --> 02:56:07,679
Cuz he wants to delineate between like

3375
02:56:07,935 --> 02:56:09,215
It's a it's a new

3376
02:56:09,471 --> 02:56:10,751
If the.com billionaire

3377
02:56:11,775 --> 02:56:12,287
He's really cute

3378
02:56:12,799 --> 02:56:13,311
So now

3379
02:56:13,823 --> 02:56:14,335
Here's where things

3380
02:56:16,383 --> 02:56:19,199
Where is his show on September

3381
02:56:19,711 --> 02:56:20,223
Then

3382
02:56:20,479 --> 02:56:21,247
He was due to

3383
02:56:21,503 --> 02:56:22,015
The comeback

3384
02:56:22,271 --> 02:56:24,319
From 10 to 11 p.m.

3385
02:56:24,831 --> 02:56:26,623
Yes Larry Nichols

3386
02:56:26,879 --> 02:56:27,391
Yes

3387
02:56:27,647 --> 02:56:31,231
They were going to do an interview

3388
02:56:31,487 --> 02:56:33,791
And then they were going to Premiere a documentary

3389
02:56:34,559 --> 02:56:35,071
He said

3390
02:56:35,327 --> 02:56:37,375
People down to tape Larry Nichols

3391
02:56:37,887 --> 02:56:38,399
At his house

3392
02:56:38,655 --> 02:56:41,727
His address has been given out all our show

3393
02:56:50,431 --> 02:56:51,967
Give you his phone number

3394
02:56:54,015 --> 02:56:55,039
Still on the internet

3395
02:56:55,551 --> 02:56:58,879
On out Jones

3396
02:56:59,135 --> 02:57:05,023
They taste sour long interview with Larry 2

3397
02:57:06,303 --> 02:57:06,815
Christina

3398
02:57:08,095 --> 02:57:08,863
Lyrics

3399
02:57:09,119 --> 02:57:10,655
Clearly didn't answer the

3400
02:57:11,679 --> 02:57:13,983
Because the first time purpose

3401
02:57:14,495 --> 02:57:19,103
The first half hour of the show is Alex Jones vamping like hell

3402
02:57:19,615 --> 02:57:21,407
He's just talking about like Meyer of the day

3403
02:57:22,431 --> 02:57:24,479
We're great

3404
02:57:24,735 --> 02:57:26,271
So much filler

3405
02:57:26,527 --> 02:57:31,135
Recite the first 25 minutes on the radio and then

3406
02:57:31,391 --> 02:57:32,159
People not on the

3407
02:57:32,415 --> 02:57:35,231
What is he's trying to say

3408
02:57:35,487 --> 02:57:36,767
Without getting into anything

3409
02:57:37,023 --> 02:57:37,791
Then he can't

3410
02:57:38,047 --> 02:57:38,815
Bale from

3411
02:57:39,071 --> 02:57:42,143
Play reggaeton

3412
02:57:42,399 --> 02:57:43,167
That maintenance

3413
02:57:44,447 --> 02:57:45,983
Yeah

3414
02:57:46,751 --> 02:57:47,263
Exactly

3415
02:57:47,519 --> 02:57:51,103
And so about 25 minutes or so 30 minutes in

3416
02:57:51,359 --> 02:57:53,407
Larry Nichols on the phone

3417
02:57:53,663 --> 02:57:55,455
Emma just talked about

3418
02:57:55,711 --> 02:57:56,479
How much calories

3419
02:57:57,759 --> 02:57:58,271
Cuz that's his

3420
02:57:58,527 --> 02:57:59,295
Is bread and butter

3421
02:57:59,551 --> 02:58:00,575
Larry Nichols

3422
02:58:01,599 --> 02:58:02,367
Drop this

3423
02:58:02,623 --> 02:58:03,135
Chestnut

3424
02:58:04,415 --> 02:58:05,951
What Hillary needs to do

3425
02:58:07,743 --> 02:58:08,255
Is

3426
02:58:08,511 --> 02:58:09,023
She's going

3427
02:58:09,279 --> 02:58:11,071
To make herself the underdog

3428
02:58:11,583 --> 02:58:12,863
That's why she

3429
02:58:13,375 --> 02:58:15,167
Released all this information

3430
02:58:16,191 --> 02:58:16,959
About the

3431
02:58:17,471 --> 02:58:17,983
Wait

3432
02:58:18,239 --> 02:58:24,127
She did Hillary release her own the old is the information about the service

3433
02:58:24,383 --> 02:58:26,687
Yes because she needs to make herself the underdog

3434
02:58:27,199 --> 02:58:29,247
Which is out of Larry Nichols Playbook

3435
02:58:29,759 --> 02:58:31,551
From way back in the ark

3436
02:58:32,575 --> 02:58:35,135
They'd make Bill Clinton and Underdog in order to make

3437
02:58:35,391 --> 02:58:36,415
Cuz everyone loves an underdog

3438
02:58:36,671 --> 02:58:37,951
Bill Clinton

3439
02:58:39,487 --> 02:58:39,999
It's all.

3440
02:58:40,511 --> 02:58:44,863
If you actually look at Larry Nichols actual history with the Clinton

3441
02:58:45,375 --> 02:58:45,887
It does

3442
02:58:47,935 --> 02:58:49,471
Scan at all

3443
02:58:51,775 --> 02:58:54,591
But that's his Big Sur

3444
02:58:54,847 --> 02:58:55,359
Is it

3445
02:58:55,615 --> 02:58:56,895
She did all this s*** to herself

3446
02:58:57,151 --> 02:58:57,663
Because

3447
02:58:57,919 --> 02:58:59,711
The clintons and the bushes are dying

3448
02:58:59,967 --> 02:59:02,015
They're always going to be at the top

3449
02:59:02,271 --> 02:59:02,783
Today to make

3450
02:59:04,319 --> 02:59:05,855
Kind of care about

3451
02:59:06,367 --> 02:59:08,671
So he goes on to say

3452
02:59:09,183 --> 02:59:09,695
Text to thing

3453
02:59:10,207 --> 02:59:11,487
On the show

3454
02:59:11,743 --> 02:59:12,511
That are

3455
02:59:12,767 --> 02:59:13,791
Dumb

3456
02:59:14,047 --> 02:59:16,863
They only have 20 minutes or so to do their interview before they

3457
02:59:17,375 --> 02:59:21,471
Expend

3458
02:59:21,727 --> 02:59:22,751
10 minutes of it

3459
02:59:23,519 --> 02:59:25,823
With Alex Jones vamping more

3460
02:59:26,079 --> 02:59:27,871
Cuz Larry Nichols has to take his dog out to ship

3461
02:59:29,151 --> 02:59:29,919
Crazy

3462
02:59:30,431 --> 02:59:34,015
It is it's it's

3463
02:59:34,783 --> 02:59:36,575
Terrible even Hitler's dog loved him

3464
02:59:36,831 --> 02:59:42,975
Is something that Larry Nichols predict about Hillary that come true

3465
02:59:45,279 --> 02:59:48,351
That Obama's have for Hillary

3466
02:59:50,655 --> 02:59:52,959
Here's what you watch

3467
02:59:53,983 --> 02:59:56,799
There probably aren't Playbook this time exactly

3468
02:59:58,335 --> 02:59:59,103
She's going to start

3469
02:59:59,359 --> 03:00:00,383
Tour

3470
03:00:00,639 --> 03:00:03,711
Now when you go deaf

3471
03:00:04,479 --> 03:00:06,015
Misogynistic

3472
03:00:06,271 --> 03:00:08,063
Hillary goes out

3473
03:00:08,831 --> 03:00:14,975
Tear up going to start crying respect

3474
03:00:15,231 --> 03:00:20,095
Makes me want her to be president

3475
03:00:20,351 --> 03:00:22,911
Misogyny behind

3476
03:00:24,447 --> 03:00:29,055
Larry Nichols complains that like

3477
03:00:29,311 --> 03:00:35,455
You call me racist and that's your way of taking my power

3478
03:00:38,271 --> 03:00:39,039
It's a load of b*******

3479
03:00:39,295 --> 03:00:43,135
Also Hillary Clinton say what you want about it

3480
03:00:43,391 --> 03:00:45,951
She came out and defended herself

3481
03:00:48,255 --> 03:00:48,767
So

3482
03:00:49,023 --> 03:00:49,791
Hilton

3483
03:00:50,047 --> 03:00:54,655
Yeah whatever Larry Nichols idea about Hillary campaign

3484
03:00:54,911 --> 03:00:55,423
Hillary

3485
03:00:55,679 --> 03:00:56,447
F****** brought it

3486
03:00:59,263 --> 03:00:59,775
To these

3487
03:01:00,287 --> 03:01:00,799
Bees attack

3488
03:01:02,591 --> 03:01:04,383
Apologize for things that

3489
03:01:04,639 --> 03:01:06,687
Thought was maybe a error in judgement

3490
03:01:06,943 --> 03:01:09,759
Yeah

3491
03:01:14,111 --> 03:01:15,903
Right-wing conspiracy

3492
03:01:16,159 --> 03:01:18,719
Mostly tracks

3493
03:01:18,975 --> 03:01:22,815
Problem in the world

3494
03:01:23,839 --> 03:01:24,607
Terrible

3495
03:01:26,143 --> 03:01:27,679
As much as he has a problem in

3496
03:01:27,935 --> 03:01:29,471
In terms of all the stuff he's done with

3497
03:01:29,727 --> 03:01:30,239
With the clintons

3498
03:01:31,007 --> 03:01:31,519
He's a huge

3499
03:01:31,775 --> 03:01:32,287
Problem in

3500
03:01:32,543 --> 03:01:33,055
General

3501
03:01:33,311 --> 03:01:34,079
Like I know he

3502
03:01:34,335 --> 03:01:37,151
We've talked about this he was saying Obama wants to

3503
03:01:37,407 --> 03:01:38,175
Become the last

3504
03:01:39,199 --> 03:01:40,479
Because venue become king

3505
03:01:40,735 --> 03:01:43,295
Like like the Patton Oswalt Dead about

3506
03:01:45,855 --> 03:01:51,999
That's president about this at all

3507
03:01:52,255 --> 03:01:53,791
The King and I

3508
03:01:54,303 --> 03:01:55,839
Attract

3509
03:01:56,863 --> 03:01:58,143
Now

3510
03:01:58,399 --> 03:02:03,007
Will never stop that's funny that's funny

3511
03:02:03,263 --> 03:02:04,543
That's funny

3512
03:02:04,799 --> 03:02:05,311
But

3513
03:02:05,567 --> 03:02:07,615
Listen to this next clip of Larry Nichols

3514
03:02:08,127 --> 03:02:09,407
And realize how much

3515
03:02:09,919 --> 03:02:10,943
F****** hate Muslims

3516
03:02:11,711 --> 03:02:12,479
And realize

3517
03:02:13,503 --> 03:02:14,783
Nichols

3518
03:02:15,039 --> 03:02:15,551
Yeah

3519
03:02:16,063 --> 03:02:17,855
It's it this is no longer funny

3520
03:02:18,623 --> 03:02:22,463
I just I just can't believe what

3521
03:02:30,911 --> 03:02:32,447
Bad guys would look good today

3522
03:02:33,215 --> 03:02:35,519
Lancaster that bad guys back then

3523
03:02:35,775 --> 03:02:39,103
The heroes today you can believe that

3524
03:02:39,871 --> 03:02:40,383
Remember this

3525
03:02:40,639 --> 03:02:42,175
Honda Element

3526
03:02:45,247 --> 03:02:47,295
What does

3527
03:02:51,647 --> 03:02:52,671
Text to spread

3528
03:02:53,695 --> 03:02:55,743
They're moving in there setting up caliphates buddy

3529
03:02:56,255 --> 03:02:58,303
How about bread

3530
03:03:03,679 --> 03:03:05,983
Really nice people

3531
03:03:06,495 --> 03:03:08,287
We could probably let another one

3532
03:03:08,543 --> 03:03:11,871
Well then comes another really nice pic

3533
03:03:13,151 --> 03:03:15,199
Read the Koran folks one day

3534
03:03:16,735 --> 03:03:22,879
For lung cancer for lung cancer

3535
03:03:28,511 --> 03:03:29,791
Got it 3 times

3536
03:03:30,559 --> 03:03:32,863
70 some odd times

3537
03:03:33,631 --> 03:03:34,143
It says

3538
03:03:34,399 --> 03:03:36,191
Try to convert the infidel

3539
03:03:47,455 --> 03:03:53,599
Christmas thank you that we can grow Christianity

3540
03:03:53,855 --> 03:03:54,623
Crusade

3541
03:03:56,671 --> 03:03:59,743
America become cowardly

3542
03:04:11,775 --> 03:04:15,103
Dearborn Michigan

3543
03:04:22,271 --> 03:04:27,135
The Wacom app and Alex should we wake up

3544
03:04:27,647 --> 03:04:29,183
Dearborn Michigan

3545
03:04:29,439 --> 03:04:32,767
Community there declares itself a caliphate

3546
03:04:36,863 --> 03:04:41,727
Michigan

3547
03:04:44,799 --> 03:04:46,335
Think there's no way

3548
03:04:47,103 --> 03:04:49,151
Do you really believe we would take our

3549
03:04:49,407 --> 03:04:50,687
Government and Alex

3550
03:04:50,943 --> 03:04:52,479
Grab them out of there

3551
03:04:52,735 --> 03:04:53,759
Yeah probably

3552
03:04:59,903 --> 03:05:05,279
With Force leggings

3553
03:05:05,535 --> 03:05:10,143
It's not like we're new to the National Guard murder people

3554
03:05:11,167 --> 03:05:13,983
Take them out of the equation like

3555
03:05:14,239 --> 03:05:17,823
The government did what it had to do with like the Bundy Ranch

3556
03:05:18,335 --> 03:05:24,479
Wildlife Preserve

3557
03:05:29,343 --> 03:05:35,231
You suggested it admirable that they didn't all die so much now I respect you for that

3558
03:05:35,487 --> 03:05:37,535
Opinion

3559
03:05:37,791 --> 03:05:38,815
A lot of restraint

3560
03:05:39,583 --> 03:05:40,095
Because

3561
03:05:41,119 --> 03:05:47,263
The restraint I wish they afforded other people break

3562
03:05:47,519 --> 03:05:49,567
Write a hundred percent agree with that

3563
03:05:49,823 --> 03:05:52,383
His presentation

3564
03:05:52,895 --> 03:05:53,919
Just playing

3565
03:06:00,831 --> 03:06:01,343
Of course I would

3566
03:06:01,599 --> 03:06:03,647
Imply

3567
03:06:03,903 --> 03:06:05,183
Broken

3568
03:06:05,695 --> 03:06:06,719
Declared a Chris

3569
03:06:10,047 --> 03:06:11,327
Or what if

3570
03:06:11,583 --> 03:06:13,119
Livesay Dearborn Michigan

3571
03:06:13,375 --> 03:06:13,887
Headache

3572
03:06:14,143 --> 03:06:15,679
Huge Christian population

3573
03:06:16,191 --> 03:06:19,519
I have decided we are going to

3574
03:06:19,775 --> 03:06:20,543
Completely

3575
03:06:20,799 --> 03:06:21,823
The Theocratic

3576
03:06:22,335 --> 03:06:22,847
Christian

3577
03:06:23,103 --> 03:06:23,615
City

3578
03:06:24,383 --> 03:06:26,943
So do you mean just Dearborn

3579
03:06:27,199 --> 03:06:29,247
I got a lot of things

3580
03:06:35,903 --> 03:06:36,927
I keep sitting

3581
03:06:37,183 --> 03:06:38,207
How can is this

3582
03:06:38,719 --> 03:06:39,743
As if I don't

3583
03:06:39,999 --> 03:06:40,767
I don't get that.

3584
03:06:41,023 --> 03:06:41,535
The concept behind

3585
03:06:41,791 --> 03:06:44,863
Girl I'm clueless

3586
03:06:45,375 --> 03:06:46,655
I just Isaiah

3587
03:06:47,167 --> 03:06:48,959
I just genuinely believe

3588
03:06:49,471 --> 03:06:50,495
Human resources

3589
03:06:50,751 --> 03:06:51,519
Capable of

3590
03:06:53,567 --> 03:06:54,335
And I'm

3591
03:06:56,127 --> 03:06:57,407
And the worst part is over

3592
03:06:57,919 --> 03:06:59,455
We proved her wrong Embassy

3593
03:06:59,711 --> 03:07:00,479
F****** Epis

3594
03:07:00,991 --> 03:07:01,503
Yeah

3595
03:07:01,759 --> 03:07:03,295
There's no rationality

3596
03:07:04,319 --> 03:07:05,599
It's not

3597
03:07:06,111 --> 03:07:08,927
Nichols has a bunch of dumb-ass bulshit as he's

3598
03:07:09,183 --> 03:07:09,951
He's known to do on this

3599
03:07:10,463 --> 03:07:11,231
As is his

3600
03:07:11,743 --> 03:07:14,303
Yeah and play

3601
03:07:15,071 --> 03:07:18,143
Like he's in the wire is Marlo not there

3602
03:07:18,399 --> 03:07:19,679
My name is

3603
03:07:20,703 --> 03:07:23,519
Tyler Nichols then they play the documentary

3604
03:07:24,031 --> 03:07:25,567
Eclipse

3605
03:07:28,639 --> 03:07:29,407
It's just

3606
03:07:29,663 --> 03:07:30,943
Him talking about how like

3607
03:07:34,783 --> 03:07:36,575
To be taken down by Benghazi

3608
03:07:38,623 --> 03:07:39,903
But what's going to take her

3609
03:07:40,415 --> 03:07:42,463
Is the documents I have about Vince Foster

3610
03:07:42,719 --> 03:07:43,231
Murder

3611
03:07:45,535 --> 03:07:47,071
We have already covered

3612
03:07:47,327 --> 03:07:48,095
Him saying

3613
03:07:48,607 --> 03:07:52,447
That the document that he has murdered

3614
03:07:52,703 --> 03:07:56,799
Miraculously showed up in his mailbox

3615
03:07:57,055 --> 03:07:59,359
Address

3616
03:07:59,871 --> 03:08:03,455
I'm in the document proving that mother was Galileo

3617
03:08:03,711 --> 03:08:04,735
Yeah maybe

3618
03:08:04,991 --> 03:08:10,367
Maybe someone falsified that based on how you keep going on a right-wing radio shows

3619
03:08:10,623 --> 03:08:12,415
I got a Twitter DM saying it

3620
03:08:12,671 --> 03:08:16,767
True

3621
03:08:17,535 --> 03:08:20,863
But there's one moment of true comedy where he talks about how

3622
03:08:23,423 --> 03:08:24,447
I was involved

3623
03:08:25,983 --> 03:08:27,263
And then my dad got

3624
03:08:27,775 --> 03:08:28,287
Long

3625
03:08:30,847 --> 03:08:34,175
The video is him smoke

3626
03:08:36,991 --> 03:08:43,135
I don't know why he got lung cancer and probably some globalist

3627
03:08:43,391 --> 03:08:49,535
Cures for lung cancer is life-changing moment that he's describing is brought on by the thing he's doing

3628
03:08:49,791 --> 03:08:50,815
In the video

3629
03:08:51,071 --> 03:08:52,607
Crazy

3630
03:08:52,863 --> 03:08:58,751
Could be involved anymore what about if the drugs brought in my daughter was doing

3631
03:09:00,287 --> 03:09:02,079
Like with Larry Nichols was it really just

3632
03:09:02,591 --> 03:09:03,103
I'm kind of getting

3633
03:09:03,359 --> 03:09:04,127
F***** over and

3634
03:09:04,383 --> 03:09:05,407
Then realized

3635
03:09:05,919 --> 03:09:07,967
Yeah but it just realized

3636
03:09:08,223 --> 03:09:09,247
Do you have

3637
03:09:10,527 --> 03:09:11,039
Just talk

3638
03:09:12,319 --> 03:09:14,623
I don't like

3639
03:09:14,879 --> 03:09:21,023
I don't think he had any idea how well this is going to work out I think he was a bitter

3640
03:09:21,279 --> 03:09:21,791
Fictive dude

3641
03:09:23,071 --> 03:09:23,583
The piece of s***

3642
03:09:24,095 --> 03:09:25,631
And wasn't

3643
03:09:26,399 --> 03:09:27,679
Is

3644
03:09:28,191 --> 03:09:31,775
He was involved with

3645
03:09:32,031 --> 03:09:35,615
I'm not really sure what the circumstances were

3646
03:09:35,871 --> 03:09:37,919
But he was involved with the contras

3647
03:09:38,175 --> 03:09:41,759
Yeah like he was involved with like Ollie North and all them

3648
03:09:42,015 --> 03:09:43,295
That's why you got fired

3649
03:09:43,551 --> 03:09:44,575
From Clinton

3650
03:09:44,831 --> 03:09:46,367
So do you mean yeah

3651
03:09:46,623 --> 03:09:47,135
He wouldn't

3652
03:09:47,391 --> 03:09:49,439
He kept making collect calls

3653
03:09:52,767 --> 03:09:54,303
Nicaragua

3654
03:09:54,559 --> 03:09:56,095
And that's why you ended up getting

3655
03:09:56,607 --> 03:10:00,191
Cuz it was a completely traceable we haven't called

3656
03:10:00,447 --> 03:10:01,727
We have a call for you from

3657
03:10:04,287 --> 03:10:05,567
Will you accept the charges

3658
03:10:05,823 --> 03:10:09,919
Hang up I got no he's just going to complain about his dog sitting

3659
03:10:10,431 --> 03:10:13,503
But like that is he

3660
03:10:13,759 --> 03:10:15,551
Involved as a funk

3661
03:10:15,807 --> 03:10:17,855
Dictionary

3662
03:10:18,367 --> 03:10:20,159
I'm not entirely sure what other key

3663
03:10:20,927 --> 03:10:22,975
He had at that point that's very difficult

3664
03:10:23,231 --> 03:10:23,743
Betrayed

3665
03:10:23,999 --> 03:10:25,279
But I

3666
03:10:25,535 --> 03:10:27,583
He got fired he blamed bill for it

3667
03:10:28,095 --> 03:10:30,911
Event created this elaborate backstory

3668
03:10:31,167 --> 03:10:32,703
That has been shown to be

3669
03:10:32,959 --> 03:10:34,239
Mostly false

3670
03:10:34,495 --> 03:10:35,007
Repeat it

3671
03:10:35,263 --> 03:10:35,775
On

3672
03:10:37,055 --> 03:10:41,663
Bears repeating you haven't listened to all of our episode

3673
03:10:41,919 --> 03:10:43,711
He was on a right-wing radio showing

3674
03:10:43,967 --> 03:10:45,247
Claimed to be an assassin

3675
03:10:45,503 --> 03:10:47,039
Who killed people for hire

3676
03:10:47,295 --> 03:10:49,855
For the clintons he was their hired assassin

3677
03:10:50,111 --> 03:10:51,903
He said that on radio show

3678
03:10:52,159 --> 03:10:52,927
And then

3679
03:10:53,183 --> 03:10:55,743
When I was high on pills

3680
03:10:55,999 --> 03:10:59,839
When I was

3681
03:11:00,095 --> 03:11:00,607
That

3682
03:11:00,863 --> 03:11:02,399
The kind of person were talking about

3683
03:11:02,655 --> 03:11:04,703
Liar

3684
03:11:06,239 --> 03:11:07,263
Vince Foster killed

3685
03:11:07,775 --> 03:11:09,311
Yeah it was not a murder

3686
03:11:09,567 --> 03:11:12,895
Yeah the reason most people think it's a murder

3687
03:11:13,151 --> 03:11:14,687
Is because of this document

3688
03:11:14,943 --> 03:11:17,503
Yeah just mysteriously showed up in Larry Nichols

3689
03:11:21,855 --> 03:11:24,671
Does Rob Larry nickel

3690
03:11:28,511 --> 03:11:32,351
Drudge Report of their time

3691
03:11:32,607 --> 03:11:33,631
Yeah but like

3692
03:11:35,679 --> 03:11:36,959
Is it was moved

3693
03:11:37,215 --> 03:11:38,751
All that stuff

3694
03:11:39,007 --> 03:11:39,775
Zip Clinton

3695
03:11:40,031 --> 03:11:40,799
Sports Department

3696
03:11:41,055 --> 03:11:42,847
Department to take the murder

3697
03:11:43,103 --> 03:11:44,639
Navigation instead of that be

3698
03:11:44,895 --> 03:11:47,455
All that stuff comes from Larry Nichols and is there

3699
03:11:49,759 --> 03:11:51,807
I've seen the document that

3700
03:11:52,319 --> 03:11:53,343
Larry Nichols

3701
03:11:53,855 --> 03:11:56,671
Like I played it on the Alex Jones Show

3702
03:11:56,927 --> 03:11:58,975
Name Cran

3703
03:11:59,487 --> 03:12:00,767
It might as well have been

3704
03:12:02,559 --> 03:12:03,839
The late night

3705
03:12:04,095 --> 03:12:04,863
Portion of the 60

3706
03:12:05,119 --> 03:12:05,887
Now we get to the seven

3707
03:12:06,399 --> 03:12:12,031
The money by we are now we are now 24 hours into the money

3708
03:12:13,311 --> 03:12:16,127
And Alex Jones is trying to raise a million dollars

3709
03:12:16,383 --> 03:12:17,407
What kind of lunatic

3710
03:12:20,223 --> 03:12:20,735
You're looking

3711
03:12:24,831 --> 03:12:26,111
Goodnight part come on

3712
03:12:26,367 --> 03:12:28,159
Like I understand

3713
03:12:28,671 --> 03:12:31,487
I've watched

3714
03:12:31,743 --> 03:12:34,559
Involved

3715
03:12:36,095 --> 03:12:37,631
Why would you do that

3716
03:12:39,423 --> 03:12:40,191
I just don't know

3717
03:12:41,215 --> 03:12:42,751
What it is they think it's going to

3718
03:12:44,031 --> 03:12:44,799
If you do 8

3719
03:12:45,055 --> 03:12:47,103
27 hour Show versus

3720
03:12:47,359 --> 03:12:48,127
84 hour

3721
03:12:48,895 --> 03:12:50,943
Like tomorrow

3722
03:12:51,967 --> 03:12:52,479
Actually

3723
03:12:52,735 --> 03:12:53,503
Yes please

3724
03:12:53,759 --> 03:12:54,271
So much

3725
03:12:54,527 --> 03:12:56,319
Alex Jones knows full well

3726
03:12:56,575 --> 03:12:59,135
The only times are going to be making money ordering history

3727
03:13:00,159 --> 03:13:00,671
But

3728
03:13:00,927 --> 03:13:02,719
Maybe we get a couple thousand

3729
03:13:02,975 --> 03:13:05,279
Maybe we get a little bit of stragglers

3730
03:13:05,535 --> 03:13:06,303
Yes

3731
03:13:06,815 --> 03:13:12,959
Are you f****** work

3732
03:13:13,215 --> 03:13:17,823
Maybe some people

3733
03:13:18,079 --> 03:13:18,847
Big donation

3734
03:13:19,103 --> 03:13:20,895
Yeah so there's that there's just

3735
03:13:21,663 --> 03:13:22,943
We need to be

3736
03:13:23,199 --> 03:13:24,223
Off internet

3737
03:13:24,735 --> 03:13:26,527
On that on that like

3738
03:13:26,783 --> 03:13:27,551
It's a drain

3739
03:13:27,807 --> 03:13:29,343
And we got to catch as much as we ran

3740
03:13:31,135 --> 03:13:32,671
We got to make sure we're catching all that hay

3741
03:13:33,183 --> 03:13:34,207
What you want

3742
03:13:34,463 --> 03:13:35,487
Has money

3743
03:13:36,511 --> 03:13:38,047
You got to catch all of it

3744
03:13:39,839 --> 03:13:45,983
I'm not thrilled with this I love it I love it but it's the difference between

3745
03:13:46,239 --> 03:13:47,519
Using a thick or thin comb

3746
03:13:47,775 --> 03:13:48,287
You know like

3747
03:13:50,335 --> 03:13:52,895
Find count we got to get all the money out of this we can

3748
03:13:53,919 --> 03:13:54,687
Whole day

3749
03:13:55,199 --> 03:13:56,223
Someone'll TuneIn

3750
03:13:56,479 --> 03:13:57,247
A baby like

3751
03:13:57,503 --> 03:13:58,527
I love Liberty

3752
03:14:01,599 --> 03:14:02,111
Comparison

3753
03:14:03,391 --> 03:14:07,743
Like our usual like a or like or like with Jimmy Pardo

3754
03:14:08,255 --> 03:14:11,071
Like cherry

3755
03:14:11,583 --> 03:14:12,351
But exactly

3756
03:14:13,375 --> 03:14:14,655
0.0 is

3757
03:14:14,911 --> 03:14:15,935
We're going to

3758
03:14:16,191 --> 03:14:17,215
Continue to have a show

3759
03:14:17,727 --> 03:14:20,287
This is going to be something we're going to have these

3760
03:14:20,799 --> 03:14:25,663
They don't have many gas

3761
03:14:25,919 --> 03:14:28,735
Even if you're not interested for 2 hours

3762
03:14:28,991 --> 03:14:30,783
Like hey maybe you're a big fan of

3763
03:14:31,039 --> 03:14:32,831
Doug Benson Leo zagami

3764
03:14:33,087 --> 03:14:35,135
So you show up Joyce Brady

3765
03:14:37,439 --> 03:14:39,231
That would be

3766
03:14:39,999 --> 03:14:41,023
But but

3767
03:14:41,279 --> 03:14:43,839
Like other other

3768
03:14:44,095 --> 03:14:44,863
Marathon

3769
03:14:45,375 --> 03:14:47,679
Idea of life

3770
03:14:51,263 --> 03:14:51,775
And he does

3771
03:14:52,799 --> 03:14:54,591
Most marathons have Goodwill

3772
03:14:55,359 --> 03:14:56,895
You know what

3773
03:14:57,151 --> 03:14:58,687
Fair

3774
03:14:59,967 --> 03:15:06,111
Most marathons come from a place of we want to do good most of the time but they're doing

3775
03:15:06,367 --> 03:15:09,695
If it's you know Jerry's Kids

3776
03:15:09,951 --> 03:15:14,559
A park A Thon money for charity and they hope that things are entertaining

3777
03:15:14,815 --> 03:15:16,351
And I've watched

3778
03:15:16,607 --> 03:15:17,887
4 years in Boyle

3779
03:15:18,143 --> 03:15:19,423
Is not entertaining

3780
03:15:20,703 --> 03:15:23,519
The slog know they don't give a fuk

3781
03:15:24,031 --> 03:15:25,055
They Don't Really Care

3782
03:15:25,567 --> 03:15:26,079
It's just a

3783
03:15:26,335 --> 03:15:27,359
Marketing

3784
03:15:27,615 --> 03:15:30,431
It's not like this money is going to charity

3785
03:15:30,687 --> 03:15:33,759
Right clear the money is just going to

3786
03:15:34,015 --> 03:15:35,551
The things we already do

3787
03:15:38,879 --> 03:15:41,695
Already f******

3788
03:15:41,951 --> 03:15:42,975
Slapdash

3789
03:15:43,231 --> 03:15:44,767
And he's not even offering bugs

3790
03:15:45,023 --> 03:15:46,303
Do people like NPR.

3791
03:15:47,583 --> 03:15:48,095
Part out of it

3792
03:15:48,863 --> 03:15:49,375
He's just

3793
03:15:49,631 --> 03:15:52,191
It's just madcap desperation

3794
03:15:52,447 --> 03:15:52,959
So

3795
03:15:53,215 --> 03:15:53,727
When

3796
03:15:55,007 --> 03:15:56,543
But he ended his show

3797
03:15:56,799 --> 03:15:57,567
On the 6th

3798
03:15:58,591 --> 03:16:01,663
They had in the hundreds of thousands of dollars

3799
03:16:01,919 --> 03:16:02,431
Sprite

3800
03:16:03,455 --> 03:16:05,247
They were pretty well on their way

3801
03:16:06,015 --> 03:16:07,039
Here's where we

3802
03:16:07,295 --> 03:16:08,319
We start on the 7th

3803
03:16:08,831 --> 03:16:10,879
Here's where the finances are on the beginning

3804
03:16:18,303 --> 03:16:19,327
+ 500

3805
03:16:19,839 --> 03:16:21,887
60 something thousand dollars

3806
03:16:22,143 --> 03:16:23,167
We're just about to update

3807
03:16:27,007 --> 03:16:31,103
And the biggest one

3808
03:16:31,359 --> 03:16:33,663
Today

3809
03:16:37,759 --> 03:16:38,527
Dollars

3810
03:16:38,783 --> 03:16:42,111
$100

3811
03:16:42,623 --> 03:16:43,135
Thousand

3812
03:16:50,815 --> 03:16:52,863
Towards crew towards travel

3813
03:16:53,119 --> 03:16:56,447
Towards camera fobs towards editing

3814
03:16:56,959 --> 03:16:57,727
Sports reporters

3815
03:16:57,983 --> 03:17:03,103
Research cameras

3816
03:17:03,615 --> 03:17:07,455
But all the other stuff that he list

3817
03:17:07,711 --> 03:17:09,247
Stop it he's already doing

3818
03:17:09,503 --> 03:17:11,295
So like 8%

3819
03:17:12,319 --> 03:17:16,159
F*** we're 24 hours and we like $550,000

3820
03:17:16,671 --> 03:17:17,951
We're not making this million

3821
03:17:18,207 --> 03:17:21,279
Yeah I think there is a part of him that's realizing

3822
03:17:22,303 --> 03:17:23,839
Is not as potent as I want

3823
03:17:24,095 --> 03:17:26,143
Cuz a million dollars he's presenting

3824
03:17:26,399 --> 03:17:27,935
This entire lead up to it

3825
03:17:28,959 --> 03:17:30,239
It's not that much money

3826
03:17:30,495 --> 03:17:34,335
We're trying to run a media operation

3827
03:17:34,847 --> 03:17:36,127
He's milking

3828
03:17:36,383 --> 03:17:39,199
Don't he's trying to get blood out of a stone

3829
03:17:39,455 --> 03:17:41,247
All he's been able to do is

3830
03:17:42,527 --> 03:17:44,831
He ends with $700,000

3831
03:17:45,855 --> 03:17:46,879
Right around there

3832
03:17:47,391 --> 03:17:48,415
Which is 300,000

3833
03:17:48,671 --> 03:17:51,743
I'm short of their now granted that make their goal

3834
03:17:51,999 --> 03:17:52,511
Later

3835
03:17:52,767 --> 03:17:58,399
Darren Slater sales

3836
03:17:58,911 --> 03:17:59,423
So like

3837
03:18:00,447 --> 03:18:02,239
Thing that I think

3838
03:18:03,007 --> 03:18:03,519
Is that

3839
03:18:04,799 --> 03:18:05,567
At a certain point

3840
03:18:06,591 --> 03:18:09,407
He didn't need the money like I guarantee that

3841
03:18:10,943 --> 03:18:12,223
Half a million

3842
03:18:12,735 --> 03:18:14,271
But he wanted a million

3843
03:18:14,527 --> 03:18:17,087
Yeah until it became a thing where

3844
03:18:17,343 --> 03:18:19,647
Now it's not about money it's about

3845
03:18:19,903 --> 03:18:22,975
Cried it's about who am I it's about how much

3846
03:18:24,511 --> 03:18:25,791
And that's why you can hear a little bit of

3847
03:18:26,047 --> 03:18:28,095
Deflation

3848
03:18:28,351 --> 03:18:29,887
He expected to wake up

3849
03:18:30,143 --> 03:18:31,423
Desperation

3850
03:18:31,935 --> 03:18:35,519
Deflation exactly why

3851
03:18:35,775 --> 03:18:36,543
Exact

3852
03:18:36,799 --> 03:18:39,103
He expected to wake up in the goal be met

3853
03:18:39,615 --> 03:18:43,967
The show with Larry Nichols that are that documentary that everyone wants

3854
03:18:44,223 --> 03:18:49,087
Also it's like 28 30 minutes long

3855
03:18:49,343 --> 03:18:49,855
Disaster

3856
03:18:50,367 --> 03:18:52,671
F*** everyone should watch it though it's so bad

3857
03:18:52,927 --> 03:18:55,487
30 short

3858
03:18:55,743 --> 03:18:57,023
It's Larry Nichols smoking

3859
03:18:57,535 --> 03:18:58,559
Talent bulshit

3860
03:19:00,607 --> 03:19:05,727
You expected I'm going to I'm going to come in on the September 17th the end of Moneyball

3861
03:19:05,983 --> 03:19:07,007
And either it's going

3862
03:19:07,263 --> 03:19:08,799
Beware it 900,000

3863
03:19:09,055 --> 03:19:10,847
Are we just got to get the last push

3864
03:19:11,103 --> 03:19:12,895
Or were already there

3865
03:19:13,151 --> 03:19:14,943
Right and we're going to

3866
03:19:15,199 --> 03:19:19,295
Started

3867
03:19:19,551 --> 03:19:23,903
For 3.5 billion people we touch with our social

3868
03:19:24,159 --> 03:19:25,951
And I think he's starting to realize

3869
03:19:26,463 --> 03:19:30,303
He ain't got s*** right to what I was talking about

3870
03:19:30,559 --> 03:19:33,375
Right when he went there and did the Superman

3871
03:19:33,631 --> 03:19:35,167
With Hillary for prison shirt

3872
03:19:35,423 --> 03:19:38,495
And everyone in the f****** Arenas are for Trump

3873
03:19:38,751 --> 03:19:39,775
Recognized

3874
03:19:40,031 --> 03:19:40,799
Oh s***

3875
03:19:41,567 --> 03:19:42,591
Okay I think

3876
03:19:43,103 --> 03:19:44,127
That my premise

3877
03:19:44,639 --> 03:19:45,663
Bet the money bomb

3878
03:19:45,919 --> 03:19:46,687
Was

3879
03:19:46,943 --> 03:19:48,991
Money gets funneled in

3880
03:19:49,247 --> 03:19:50,271
I was wrong

3881
03:19:50,783 --> 03:19:51,295
But I

3882
03:19:51,551 --> 03:19:52,575
The disaster

3883
03:19:52,831 --> 03:19:55,647
Disaster is Billy Idol of $500

3884
03:19:55,903 --> 03:19:57,439
$7,000 I'd love that

3885
03:19:57,695 --> 03:19:58,207
But the

3886
03:19:58,463 --> 03:19:59,487
Disappointment of

3887
03:19:59,743 --> 03:20:01,279
How potent is audiences

3888
03:20:01,535 --> 03:20:02,559
Compared to

3889
03:20:02,815 --> 03:20:03,839
How Gloria

3890
03:20:04,607 --> 03:20:05,887
The reaction was

3891
03:20:06,399 --> 03:20:06,911
From

3892
03:20:07,679 --> 03:20:08,959
Trump audio

3893
03:20:09,471 --> 03:20:09,983
I think

3894
03:20:10,239 --> 03:20:13,055
That those two things Duhamel

3895
03:20:17,407 --> 03:20:18,431
Has him recognize

3896
03:20:19,199 --> 03:20:20,223
The real

3897
03:20:20,479 --> 03:20:21,247
Extent of his

3898
03:20:22,271 --> 03:20:22,783
Which is

3899
03:20:23,039 --> 03:20:23,551
700g

3900
03:20:23,807 --> 03:20:25,087
Which is not as good as he help

3901
03:20:25,599 --> 03:20:27,135
And you

3902
03:20:27,391 --> 03:20:28,159
Joe Biggs

3903
03:20:28,415 --> 03:20:29,951
Showing up at a trump rally

3904
03:20:30,719 --> 03:20:31,999
As a like

3905
03:20:32,767 --> 03:20:34,815
There is a whole new world

3906
03:20:35,071 --> 03:20:39,167
Right here

3907
03:20:39,935 --> 03:20:40,447
Yeah

3908
03:20:44,031 --> 03:20:45,823
But if we throw it

3909
03:20:46,335 --> 03:20:48,895
Very into some other weird

3910
03:20:49,151 --> 03:20:50,175
That's where we get into it

3911
03:20:50,431 --> 03:20:52,991
He thinks he's throwing in the Trump on

3912
03:20:53,247 --> 03:20:53,759
Top of it

3913
03:20:54,015 --> 03:20:56,319
As opposed to he's surrendering

3914
03:20:58,111 --> 03:20:59,647
I think it might be the beginning of it

3915
03:21:01,439 --> 03:21:02,207
That's really interesting

3916
03:21:02,463 --> 03:21:08,607
I'm not even listen to it

3917
03:21:08,863 --> 03:21:09,887
Damn hell knows what's going

3918
03:21:10,143 --> 03:21:15,775
I know every single time I've been certain of something crazy

3919
03:21:16,799 --> 03:21:20,895
There's no way he's a punk

3920
03:21:21,407 --> 03:21:23,711
Shut your fat mouth

3921
03:21:23,967 --> 03:21:24,991
Holy

3922
03:21:25,503 --> 03:21:29,087
Maybe when I put that I was like

3923
03:21:29,343 --> 03:21:34,975
Well maybe he never gets on the Trump trade at all forgetting the world that we live in now

3924
03:21:35,231 --> 03:21:37,279
Saladworks

3925
03:21:37,791 --> 03:21:38,559
Itech

3926
03:21:39,327 --> 03:21:39,839
I was like

3927
03:21:40,607 --> 03:21:44,447
This investigation is so f***** up

3928
03:21:44,959 --> 03:21:49,055
How the f*** did he say now

3929
03:21:49,567 --> 03:21:50,847
Here's worth shitt get Center

3930
03:21:51,103 --> 03:21:51,615
Yes

3931
03:21:52,127 --> 03:21:52,895
The debate

3932
03:21:53,151 --> 03:21:54,175
The Republican debate

3933
03:21:54,431 --> 03:21:54,943
Who's on the 6th

3934
03:21:55,199 --> 03:21:55,711
The 2nd

3935
03:21:55,967 --> 03:21:56,735
The night of the 6th

3936
03:21:57,759 --> 03:21:59,295
Mystery Science

3937
03:21:59,551 --> 03:22:00,319
Peter debate

3938
03:22:00,575 --> 03:22:03,647
Thing all the Alex Wilson Auto Part

3939
03:22:04,671 --> 03:22:05,695
So much fun

3940
03:22:06,207 --> 03:22:07,231
Cell phone

3941
03:22:09,023 --> 03:22:11,583
Then they really took down monosa had the

3942
03:22:13,631 --> 03:22:17,727
Not libertarian enough Alex

3943
03:22:17,983 --> 03:22:19,263
Get to respond

3944
03:22:21,055 --> 03:22:22,591
And so now we're going to enter

3945
03:22:23,359 --> 03:22:24,639
Little bit of

3946
03:22:25,151 --> 03:22:26,431
Little bit of debate recap

3947
03:22:26,687 --> 03:22:28,735
Here's Alex Jones highlights

3948
03:22:28,991 --> 03:22:30,527
Of last night's debate

3949
03:22:33,599 --> 03:22:35,903
Does Planned Parenthood

3950
03:22:40,511 --> 03:22:44,095
This is also based on all the Center for Medical progress videos

3951
03:22:44,351 --> 03:22:48,703
Of course of course videos

3952
03:22:48,959 --> 03:22:49,727
I've cutouts

3953
03:22:49,983 --> 03:22:52,031
So much of Alex complaining about that stuff

3954
03:22:52,543 --> 03:22:56,639
Because it's just so boring we don't need to cover it over and over again

3955
03:22:57,407 --> 03:22:58,175
Anybody references

3956
03:22:58,431 --> 03:22:58,943
Screws

3957
03:22:59,199 --> 03:23:01,247
In the context of a phrase that doesn't

3958
03:23:01,759 --> 03:23:02,271
And with

3959
03:23:02,783 --> 03:23:03,295
Loftus

3960
03:23:06,111 --> 03:23:07,647
Covering

3961
03:23:07,903 --> 03:23:10,975
Center for Medical

3962
03:23:11,231 --> 03:23:13,279
He is talking about

3963
03:23:13,535 --> 03:23:14,047
Legal

3964
03:23:14,559 --> 03:23:15,071
Regal

3965
03:23:17,119 --> 03:23:19,167
Bacon

3966
03:23:19,423 --> 03:23:19,935
Right

3967
03:23:20,703 --> 03:23:23,519
I live baby

3968
03:23:23,775 --> 03:23:24,799
Hold on

3969
03:23:26,847 --> 03:23:29,151
As long as the baby is touching the mother

3970
03:23:29,919 --> 03:23:30,943
They can cut it up

3971
03:23:31,199 --> 03:23:31,967
Then cut up

3972
03:23:34,271 --> 03:23:35,551
But if the baby stop

3973
03:23:35,807 --> 03:23:37,087
Touching the mother

3974
03:23:37,343 --> 03:23:39,135
No no

3975
03:23:39,903 --> 03:23:44,767
No I refuse to even believe that even the most irrational of human beings

3976
03:23:45,023 --> 03:23:47,071
What except

3977
03:23:47,327 --> 03:23:53,471
Crazy

3978
03:23:53,727 --> 03:23:56,031
For September 17th

3979
03:23:57,823 --> 03:24:02,175
About Red Rover situation

3980
03:24:02,687 --> 03:24:08,831
Okay heading up baby Planned Parenthood

3981
03:24:09,599 --> 03:24:11,135
But it may

3982
03:24:11,391 --> 03:24:12,927
I think it was

3983
03:24:13,951 --> 03:24:15,743
September 2015

3984
03:24:15,999 --> 03:24:18,047
The Congressional investigation started

3985
03:24:18,559 --> 03:24:19,839
Into the video

3986
03:24:21,631 --> 03:24:26,751
Now because we're in the future we know they cleared them of any wrongdoing

3987
03:24:27,007 --> 03:24:30,335
And found and all those videos

3988
03:24:30,847 --> 03:24:35,711
The deeply manipulated and edited poorly

3989
03:24:35,967 --> 03:24:40,063
Not appropriately they've been sued it's really f***** up

3990
03:24:41,855 --> 03:24:43,647
Since we've started

3991
03:24:43,903 --> 03:24:44,671
Like the court

3992
03:24:45,695 --> 03:24:46,975
K-Swiss still in motion

3993
03:24:47,231 --> 03:24:47,999
Like

3994
03:24:48,511 --> 03:24:49,535
Jeff the last week

3995
03:24:49,791 --> 03:24:51,327
Yeah bunch of those charges

3996
03:24:51,583 --> 03:24:52,607
We have said in the past

3997
03:24:52,863 --> 03:24:54,655
15 felonies that are being

3998
03:24:54,911 --> 03:24:55,423
Put on them

3999
03:24:55,679 --> 03:24:57,471
Yeah bunch of those charges got dropped

4000
03:24:57,983 --> 03:24:58,495
Like last week

4001
03:24:59,519 --> 03:25:00,031
Yeah I know

4002
03:25:00,287 --> 03:25:00,799
Why do we

4003
03:25:01,311 --> 03:25:06,175
I don't know but it does

4004
03:25:07,199 --> 03:25:09,247
A lot of it comes down to technicalities

4005
03:25:09,503 --> 03:25:11,039
And it just comes like I can't

4006
03:25:11,551 --> 03:25:14,879
Is it worth Prosecuting this further

4007
03:25:15,647 --> 03:25:17,695
You get you get somebody on

4008
03:25:17,951 --> 03:25:18,719
Tax evasion

4009
03:25:20,511 --> 03:25:21,023
Murdering

4010
03:25:21,279 --> 03:25:21,791
Everybody you've ever

4011
03:25:22,047 --> 03:25:26,399
Every investigation into whether these videos are full of s***

4012
03:25:26,911 --> 03:25:27,423
Have shown

4013
03:25:27,679 --> 03:25:28,191
Beverly

4014
03:25:33,311 --> 03:25:34,847
And Alex loves

4015
03:25:37,919 --> 03:25:38,687
Yeah

4016
03:25:39,711 --> 03:25:40,223
Bush

4017
03:25:40,479 --> 03:25:46,623
Just 40 years ago you smoke marijuana I admitted big deal

4018
03:25:48,927 --> 03:25:50,463
Donald Trump

4019
03:25:53,279 --> 03:25:54,303
And he's ugly

4020
03:25:55,071 --> 03:25:56,351
Trump

4021
03:25:57,375 --> 03:25:59,167
You look pretty goofy to me

4022
03:26:03,263 --> 03:26:08,639
Which I don't think looks goofy but I guess you can say it looks Goofy from your perspective you look like

4023
03:26:09,407 --> 03:26:13,759
Blond possum on your head

4024
03:26:14,271 --> 03:26:15,039
Then it was

4025
03:26:19,135 --> 03:26:22,463
You get your hair bleached

4026
03:26:28,351 --> 03:26:32,703
But

4027
03:26:35,775 --> 03:26:36,799
Agree

4028
03:26:37,311 --> 03:26:38,335
Believable

4029
03:26:39,103 --> 03:26:40,639
Is unbelievable

4030
03:26:46,527 --> 03:26:52,671
Where he talks about the fact that this is a country where we speak English

4031
03:26:52,927 --> 03:26:56,511
Alex

4032
03:26:57,535 --> 03:26:58,559
Not great

4033
03:26:59,071 --> 03:26:59,583
Pretty solid

4034
03:27:04,447 --> 03:27:05,471
Super unexpected

4035
03:27:06,495 --> 03:27:10,591
Oh man you know that three months after this point

4036
03:27:11,359 --> 03:27:13,407
Trump is on Alex's show

4037
03:27:13,663 --> 03:27:14,175
Yeah

4038
03:27:14,943 --> 03:27:15,967
That's so funny

4039
03:27:16,991 --> 03:27:18,015
What is going on

4040
03:27:18,527 --> 03:27:21,855
I don't know

4041
03:27:23,135 --> 03:27:27,231
How do you not negotiate

4042
03:27:28,255 --> 03:27:28,767
Hear me out

4043
03:27:29,023 --> 03:27:29,791
Here's what I think

4044
03:27:33,887 --> 03:27:34,399
I think

4045
03:27:34,911 --> 03:27:35,679
The payment hasn't

4046
03:27:35,935 --> 03:27:36,447
Clear

4047
03:27:36,703 --> 03:27:39,519
Do you think the check hasn't cleared

4048
03:27:40,031 --> 03:27:42,335
Like he's in Dorsett but he still like

4049
03:27:42,847 --> 03:27:44,639
Why do you

4050
03:27:44,895 --> 03:27:47,967
Why do you think he's surprised to wake up in this 500000

4051
03:27:50,527 --> 03:27:51,039
Okay

4052
03:27:51,807 --> 03:27:54,623
Why do you think he's disappointed he's mad

4053
03:27:54,879 --> 03:27:55,647
Because he hasn't

4054
03:27:57,951 --> 03:27:59,999
And he thinks that the movement

4055
03:28:02,559 --> 03:28:08,703
The check if I can't tell how much of what I

4056
03:28:10,239 --> 03:28:15,103
I'm just trying to make sense of this s*** I love it so crazy want you to be right

4057
03:28:15,359 --> 03:28:15,871
But that

4058
03:28:16,127 --> 03:28:19,711
Too far but it's nonsense even it like take all of that

4059
03:28:19,967 --> 03:28:20,735
Cuz I don't think that

4060
03:28:21,759 --> 03:28:24,319
Timing the s*** about Trump

4061
03:28:24,575 --> 03:28:25,087
Absolute

4062
03:28:27,903 --> 03:28:29,439
Take my nonsense out of it

4063
03:28:29,951 --> 03:28:31,487
Before that

4064
03:28:32,255 --> 03:28:32,767
He can

4065
03:28:33,023 --> 03:28:33,535
Be

4066
03:28:34,047 --> 03:28:35,583
F*** you shut your mouth

4067
03:28:35,839 --> 03:28:36,607
You're a punk

4068
03:28:37,375 --> 03:28:39,679
Whatever

4069
03:28:39,935 --> 03:28:43,007
Oh you're mad at Rand Paul askew

4070
03:28:43,263 --> 03:28:44,031
About your appearance

4071
03:28:46,847 --> 03:28:47,871
I suck your dick please

4072
03:28:48,383 --> 03:28:49,919
Within 3 months

4073
03:28:50,943 --> 03:28:51,967
He's crazy

4074
03:28:52,223 --> 03:28:54,271
Yeah no

4075
03:28:56,575 --> 03:28:59,135
That once he becomes Trump's cheerleader

4076
03:28:59,391 --> 03:29:02,463
He don't think that all this still exists on the internet

4077
03:29:04,255 --> 03:29:05,791
Established he has no concept

4078
03:29:06,559 --> 03:29:11,167
Movie ideas that like all that like stuff like every time we gone through

4079
03:29:11,423 --> 03:29:14,239
Alex Jones says this now in defensive

4080
03:29:14,495 --> 03:29:16,031
We go back and we have a clip of him

4081
03:29:19,359 --> 03:29:21,919
Everything Trump has ever said we have a twin

4082
03:29:23,455 --> 03:29:29,599
Are you are different steroids

4083
03:29:30,111 --> 03:29:30,879
They don't care

4084
03:29:31,391 --> 03:29:32,415
It's

4085
03:29:32,927 --> 03:29:35,231
Nobody is actually holding them accountable

4086
03:29:35,487 --> 03:29:39,583
Which is the biggest we can go on Twitter and we can see people going like

4087
03:29:39,839 --> 03:29:42,143
Here's what they said here's what they used to say

4088
03:29:42,399 --> 03:29:43,679
But nobody's actually f******

4089
03:29:43,935 --> 03:29:47,775
We're trying and I don't know what to do we're trying

4090
03:29:48,031 --> 03:29:50,335
I wake up everyday and I don't know what

4091
03:29:50,591 --> 03:29:51,359
To do dad

4092
03:29:51,871 --> 03:29:54,687
I can't tell you but we're trying

4093
03:29:54,943 --> 03:29:55,967
We got a couple more clips

4094
03:30:00,831 --> 03:30:05,695
That we're trying to do a fundraiser

4095
03:30:06,207 --> 03:30:07,231
So

4096
03:30:10,559 --> 03:30:12,863
The fact that Alex has been very

4097
03:30:14,655 --> 03:30:15,679
Free pro-russia

4098
03:30:17,215 --> 03:30:22,335
Pro strongman pro-putin

4099
03:30:22,591 --> 03:30:23,615
Not necessarily

4100
03:30:23,871 --> 03:30:25,407
Pro-russia

4101
03:30:25,663 --> 03:30:26,943
No that's not fair

4102
03:30:27,199 --> 03:30:28,479
Pro-russian pro-assad

4103
03:30:29,759 --> 03:30:33,087
He has been brought before the strongman

4104
03:30:33,599 --> 03:30:34,367
The things you said

4105
03:30:36,159 --> 03:30:37,439
Pro-russia

4106
03:30:37,695 --> 03:30:38,207
You're right

4107
03:30:38,463 --> 03:30:39,487
Angry

4108
03:30:39,743 --> 03:30:41,023
This next clip brings

4109
03:30:42,559 --> 03:30:48,703
Play don't like

4110
03:31:01,759 --> 03:31:04,063
Because of al-Qaeda

4111
03:31:07,135 --> 03:31:08,671
Yuma government

4112
03:31:10,719 --> 03:31:11,999
Essentially is saying

4113
03:31:12,255 --> 03:31:15,583
On the wrong side of everything is on the right

4114
03:31:18,911 --> 03:31:19,679
But how

4115
03:31:21,215 --> 03:31:21,983
What what

4116
03:31:24,031 --> 03:31:25,567
We have funded

4117
03:31:25,823 --> 03:31:26,847
Created

4118
03:31:27,615 --> 03:31:29,151
Al-Qaeda and Isis

4119
03:31:30,175 --> 03:31:30,943
Destabilize

4120
03:31:31,967 --> 03:31:33,759
Because of that

4121
03:31:34,015 --> 03:31:36,575
We are on the wrong side of everything

4122
03:31:36,831 --> 03:31:38,367
Russia

4123
03:31:38,623 --> 03:31:39,903
Just trying to destroy the forces

4124
03:31:40,159 --> 03:31:41,695
That we've brought in their forties

4125
03:31:43,231 --> 03:31:44,767
And

4126
03:31:47,071 --> 03:31:49,631
I just don't get that very simplistic

4127
03:31:50,655 --> 03:31:51,167
Argument

4128
03:31:51,423 --> 03:31:53,983
Because there's a dump in the same way that

4129
03:31:54,495 --> 03:31:55,519
In the same way that there's a

4130
03:31:55,775 --> 03:31:57,055
Kernel of truth to it

4131
03:31:58,079 --> 03:31:59,359
That is also such a

4132
03:31:59,615 --> 03:32:00,383
Wilfred

4133
03:32:01,407 --> 03:32:01,919
Mister

4134
03:32:02,175 --> 03:32:04,479
Misunderstanding of the way that the world works

4135
03:32:05,503 --> 03:32:06,271
It's hard to imagine

4136
03:32:06,527 --> 03:32:07,039
Totally

4137
03:32:07,551 --> 03:32:10,623
River of Russia

4138
03:32:11,903 --> 03:32:12,415
Cool

4139
03:32:12,671 --> 03:32:14,719
What's the motivation

4140
03:32:14,975 --> 03:32:21,119
For him being in favor of a son

4141
03:32:21,375 --> 03:32:22,399
Russian propaganda

4142
03:32:23,167 --> 03:32:23,935
He's a tease

4143
03:32:25,727 --> 03:32:28,543
These beholding to RT and Sputnik

4144
03:32:29,055 --> 03:32:30,847
Information

4145
03:32:31,103 --> 03:32:33,151
I mean yeah you make the good point of him

4146
03:32:33,407 --> 03:32:34,175
As as

4147
03:32:34,687 --> 03:32:35,199
Affirmations

4148
03:32:35,967 --> 03:32:36,479
But

4149
03:32:36,735 --> 03:32:37,759
If you put out

4150
03:32:38,015 --> 03:32:39,295
Stories about

4151
03:32:39,551 --> 03:32:40,063
No cuz

4152
03:32:40,575 --> 03:32:42,367
Didn't get the things that you will say

4153
03:32:43,135 --> 03:32:44,159
About Islamabad

4154
03:32:44,415 --> 03:32:45,695
Being oppressive tased

4155
03:32:51,327 --> 03:32:52,863
Yeah

4156
03:32:55,679 --> 03:33:00,287
Notarized

4157
03:33:00,543 --> 03:33:04,895
Is that

4158
03:33:05,151 --> 03:33:06,431
Is western-backed

4159
03:33:06,687 --> 03:33:07,711
Rebel forces

4160
03:33:07,967 --> 03:33:09,503
That are faking

4161
03:33:11,551 --> 03:33:15,135
That is the narrative that's their name yes yes

4162
03:33:15,647 --> 03:33:17,439
And that's

4163
03:33:20,767 --> 03:33:23,839
These people on who are

4164
03:33:24,351 --> 03:33:25,631
Disreputable sources

4165
03:33:27,423 --> 03:33:30,495
Yeah I can't resent Ambassador guy who he had on

4166
03:33:30,751 --> 03:33:36,383
Who acts clear Financial

4167
03:33:36,639 --> 03:33:37,407
If you're Russian

4168
03:33:37,663 --> 03:33:39,455
Yeah and you are on

4169
03:33:39,967 --> 03:33:40,735
Media of

4170
03:33:42,271 --> 03:33:42,783
Probably have time

4171
03:33:43,807 --> 03:33:44,319
The oligarch

4172
03:33:44,575 --> 03:33:45,087
With

4173
03:33:45,343 --> 03:33:46,111
A couple exceptions

4174
03:33:46,367 --> 03:33:47,135
Yes absolutely

4175
03:33:47,647 --> 03:33:50,207
That is the narrative that Alex

4176
03:33:50,463 --> 03:33:51,743
He's on board

4177
03:33:52,511 --> 03:33:53,279
8

4178
03:33:53,535 --> 03:33:54,047
Seems

4179
03:33:54,303 --> 03:33:54,815
Dumb

4180
03:33:55,071 --> 03:33:56,351
James Wilde but that

4181
03:33:57,119 --> 03:33:58,399
That's that's what he pushes

4182
03:33:58,655 --> 03:34:00,447
It's every single thing

4183
03:34:00,959 --> 03:34:02,239
Something do that

4184
03:34:02,751 --> 03:34:04,287
Like I

4185
03:34:05,055 --> 03:34:06,847
Arguing other Russian

4186
03:34:08,127 --> 03:34:08,895
But its side

4187
03:34:09,407 --> 03:34:10,175
So very

4188
03:34:10,431 --> 03:34:10,943
Clearly

4189
03:34:11,967 --> 03:34:13,503
Set out to murder his own

4190
03:34:14,015 --> 03:34:16,575
Here's where it seems like such a

4191
03:34:16,831 --> 03:34:19,647
First thing all over again

4192
03:34:19,903 --> 03:34:23,231
Like are you for Hitler murdering Jews or against

4193
03:34:23,487 --> 03:34:25,279
That's what a son is to

4194
03:34:28,095 --> 03:34:32,703
Is that Obama said the redline is using gas

4195
03:34:32,959 --> 03:34:33,983
Using gas tax on

4196
03:34:34,751 --> 03:34:35,263
How many didn't

4197
03:34:38,335 --> 03:34:38,847
Clearly

4198
03:34:40,639 --> 03:34:41,151
Is more

4199
03:34:41,919 --> 03:34:42,687
Proud moments

4200
03:34:43,455 --> 03:34:45,247
Sending the world

4201
03:34:45,503 --> 03:34:46,015
Agree

4202
03:34:46,527 --> 03:34:47,039
But

4203
03:34:47,295 --> 03:34:52,415
Alex's and all the Russian media's argument about that is

4204
03:34:52,927 --> 03:34:57,279
Why the f*** would do that if Obama said that was a red line

4205
03:34:57,791 --> 03:34:58,815
Why would they

4206
03:34:59,071 --> 03:34:59,583
Okay

4207
03:34:59,839 --> 03:35:05,983
That which is compelling interesting angle yeah I agree

4208
03:35:06,239 --> 03:35:07,775
People if you don't

4209
03:35:10,591 --> 03:35:11,359
Obama invited

4210
03:35:12,383 --> 03:35:16,991
Okay so the end result legitimately is World War

4211
03:35:17,503 --> 03:35:18,015
So what

4212
03:35:18,527 --> 03:35:20,063
What

4213
03:35:20,319 --> 03:35:21,343
Who is Obama

4214
03:35:21,599 --> 03:35:22,111
Sorry

4215
03:35:22,367 --> 03:35:22,879
Dancing

4216
03:35:25,439 --> 03:35:27,743
And if Obama knows that

4217
03:35:27,999 --> 03:35:29,279
Doesn't

4218
03:35:29,535 --> 03:35:30,559
Get in there and f***

4219
03:35:31,327 --> 03:35:31,839
Burn the ships

4220
03:35:32,095 --> 03:35:32,607
To the ground

4221
03:35:33,119 --> 03:35:34,143
That must be

4222
03:35:34,399 --> 03:35:35,935
All Sonos

4223
03:35:36,191 --> 03:35:36,703
It's a

4224
03:35:36,959 --> 03:35:37,471
False flag

4225
03:35:39,007 --> 03:35:40,543
And also before

4226
03:35:41,311 --> 03:35:43,871
Putin had made clear that he was not going

4227
03:35:44,127 --> 03:35:44,639
Except

4228
03:35:44,895 --> 03:35:47,711
Any of our aggression in Seattle

4229
03:35:48,479 --> 03:35:54,111
It is a much more complicated

4230
03:35:54,367 --> 03:35:54,879
Disturbed

4231
03:35:56,159 --> 03:35:57,183
Russian propaganda

4232
03:35:57,951 --> 03:35:59,743
I'm not saying that he's an agent

4233
03:35:59,999 --> 03:36:06,143
Call my calls

4234
03:36:06,399 --> 03:36:07,679
Why would you even need him

4235
03:36:07,935 --> 03:36:08,447
To be in Asia

4236
03:36:08,703 --> 03:36:09,215
Russia

4237
03:36:09,471 --> 03:36:11,775
If you have this kind of weird

4238
03:36:12,799 --> 03:36:13,567
Attention

4239
03:36:15,103 --> 03:36:16,895
Man foreign policy is tux

4240
03:36:17,151 --> 03:36:17,919
I don't know

4241
03:36:20,223 --> 03:36:21,247
I don't know if you know that's enough

4242
03:36:22,015 --> 03:36:24,063
But Global foreign policy

4243
03:36:24,831 --> 03:36:25,343
Barry comp

I'm a walk

4245
03:36:26,879 --> 03:36:27,903
Very complex

4246
03:36:32,767 --> 03:36:33,535
Entirely clear

4247
03:36:33,791 --> 03:36:34,559
Ouija

4248
03:36:34,815 --> 03:36:36,095
We've made a lot of mistakes

4249
03:36:36,607 --> 03:36:38,143
In terms of Armin Rebel

4250
03:36:38,655 --> 03:36:41,215

4251
03:36:45,055 --> 03:36:46,591

Burn him to death

4260
03:37:14,751 --> 03:37:17,311
If he survives your lighting him on fire

4261
03:37:17,567 --> 03:37:18,847
Lighting a bonfire

Jordan

4320
03:40:13,439 --> 03:40:13,951
The debate

4321
03:40:14,463 --> 03:40:14,975
Yes

4322
03:40:16,255 --> 03:40:17,535
Alex mentioned

4323
03:40:17,791 --> 03:40:18,559
A little bit earlier

4324
03:40:20,095 --> 03:40:20,607
Good thing

4325
03:40:21,119 --> 03:40:22,143
And the debate right

4326
03:40:22,399 --> 03:40:25,471
Now one of them was that people speak English not Spanish

4327
03:40:25,983 --> 03:40:26,751
I didn't like that

4328
03:40:30,079 --> 03:40:30,591
Set them up

4329
03:40:31,615 --> 03:40:32,383
But Alex did

4330
03:40:33,663 --> 03:40:34,175
Fan

4331
03:40:35,455 --> 03:40:35,967

Coming out

4334
03:40:49,535 --> 03:40:52,351
And he knows the system's going to come after him

4335
03:40:52,607 --> 03:40:55,423
What's going on

4336
03:40:55,679 --> 03:40:58,751
He doesn't want to be involved

4337
03:41:00,287 --> 03:41:01,567
What is removing health

4338
03:41:01,823 --> 03:41:07,967
Autoimmune disorders

4339
03:41:08,991 --> 03:41:12,063
Carson a medical doctor surgeon

4340
03:41:14,623 --> 03:41:16,927
Virologist

4341
03:41:17,695 --> 03:41:19,487
Future sister-in-law

4342
03:41:19,743 --> 03:41:22,047
Because he's a good guy

4343
03:41:32,031 --> 03:41:34,847
In in the debate debate

4344
03:41:35,103 --> 03:41:36,639
Trump talked about how

4345
03:41:36,895 --> 03:41:38,687
When he had kids

4346
03:41:39,199 --> 03:41:40,735
He's spaced-out the VAC

4347
03:41:41,759 --> 03:41:42,783
Cuz he thought that like

4348
03:41:43,039 --> 03:41:46,367
I've heard a bunch recently

4349
03:41:51,743 --> 03:41:52,255
Which is

4350
03:41:52,511 --> 03:41:53,023
True at all

4351
03:41:53,535 --> 03:41:54,303
No and then

4352
03:41:56,095 --> 03:41:57,631
I don't want to put too fine

4353
03:41:57,887 --> 03:41:58,399
The point on this

4354
03:41:58,655 --> 03:41:59,935
And where are you 4 hours

4355
03:42:00,191 --> 03:42:01,215
Podcast but like

4356
03:42:01,983 --> 03:42:03,519
I've looked into all of it

4357
03:42:03,775 --> 03:42:05,567
All of the anti-vax stuff

4358
03:42:06,335 --> 03:42:06,847
Pitbull

4359
03:42:09,663 --> 03:42:12,479
It's going to Wakefield

4360
03:42:12,735 --> 03:42:13,503
Sense8

4361
03:42:14,527 --> 03:42:16,575
Create

4362
03:42:17,087 --> 03:42:18,111
One guy

4363
03:42:18,367 --> 03:42:20,159
Got a f****** thing happened to him

4364
03:42:20,415 --> 03:42:22,719
Within two weeks of a vaccine news like

4365
03:42:22,975 --> 03:42:23,743
Well vaccine

4366
03:42:24,511 --> 03:42:27,327
It is always

4367
03:42:27,583 --> 03:42:28,351
F****** b*******

4368
03:42:28,607 --> 03:42:31,423
I can't

4369
03:42:31,935 --> 03:42:33,471
To deal with how much

4370
03:42:33,727 --> 03:42:34,495
I hate you

4371
03:42:35,007 --> 03:42:37,311
If you're an anti vaxxer

4372
03:42:37,567 --> 03:42:39,871
Legitimately by one

4373
03:42:40,895 --> 03:42:42,175
That is one of the most

4374
03:42:42,431 --> 03:42:42,943
Importance

4375
03:42:44,223 --> 03:42:45,247
In terms of

4376
03:42:45,759 --> 03:42:46,783
Statistics

4377
03:42:47,295 --> 03:42:48,575
That correlation

4378
03:42:48,831 --> 03:42:50,111
Does not imply causation

4379
03:42:51,135 --> 03:42:52,415
Something

4380
03:42:52,671 --> 03:42:53,439
But there is a

4381
03:42:53,695 --> 03:42:54,719
Slight relation to

4382
03:42:54,975 --> 03:42:56,511
You can't say

4383
03:42:56,767 --> 03:42:57,791
Because there's a relation

4384
03:42:58,047 --> 03:42:59,327
That explains why

4385
03:42:59,583 --> 03:43:00,095
Nuggets

4386
03:43:00,607 --> 03:43:01,119
If you can't

4387
03:43:01,375 --> 03:43:03,423
Correlation does not equal causation

4388
03:43:05,471 --> 03:43:05,983
Exist

4389
03:43:07,007 --> 03:43:07,775
The fact that it is

4390
03:43:08,031 --> 03:43:08,543
True

4391
03:43:08,799 --> 03:43:09,311
The fact that it is

4392
03:43:09,823 --> 03:43:10,591
Almost there

4393
03:43:10,847 --> 03:43:11,871
Possible foremost

4394
03:43:13,151 --> 03:43:13,663
Right

4395
03:43:14,431 --> 03:43:14,943
The most

4396
03:43:15,199 --> 03:43:15,711
Destructive force

4397
03:43:18,527 --> 03:43:19,295
One of the biggest

4398
03:43:20,575 --> 03:43:21,087
Cases about

4399
03:43:21,855 --> 03:43:23,903
And Alex Jones talks about

4400
03:43:24,415 --> 03:43:27,743
You know like in the UK

4401
03:43:29,791 --> 03:43:32,351
Is this guy named Andrew Wakefield

4402
03:43:32,607 --> 03:43:34,655
Starting

4403
03:43:36,447 --> 03:43:37,471
Were called into question

4404
03:43:37,983 --> 03:43:39,007
And he got

4405
03:43:39,263 --> 03:43:39,775
Fired

4406
03:43:41,311 --> 03:43:43,103
Because it turned out he was taking

4407
03:43:43,615 --> 03:43:44,639
Enough money

4408
03:43:44,895 --> 03:43:48,223
Animal lawyers

4409
03:43:48,735 --> 03:43:50,015
License was revoked

4410
03:43:50,271 --> 03:43:55,391
There were lawyers who were trying to get a class-action lawsuit going

4411
03:43:56,671 --> 03:43:58,975
People who hate texting

4412
03:43:59,231 --> 03:44:00,767
And he got like four

4413
03:44:02,303 --> 03:44:03,327
From those players

4414
03:44:05,631 --> 03:44:06,399
People

4415
03:44:07,167 --> 03:44:08,703
Find

4416
03:44:08,959 --> 03:44:09,471
In the past

4417
03:44:09,727 --> 03:44:10,751
Knowing that

4418
03:44:11,007 --> 03:44:12,287
Terry

4419
03:44:14,847 --> 03:44:15,871
OSHA

4420
03:44:17,663 --> 03:44:19,199
Are you saying that when you get in

4421
03:44:19,455 --> 03:44:19,967
When you get

4422
03:44:20,479 --> 03:44:20,991
Money involved with

4423
03:44:21,247 --> 03:44:22,015
Healthcare bad things

4424
03:44:23,551 --> 03:44:24,319
Special

4425
03:44:25,087 --> 03:44:26,879
Can't believe it

4426
03:44:27,135 --> 03:44:28,927
Inclusions

4427
03:44:29,183 --> 03:44:30,207
Free market

4428
03:44:30,463 --> 03:44:31,743
Free market

4429
03:44:31,999 --> 03:44:32,767
Prosperity

4430
03:44:36,863 --> 03:44:37,375
Anyway

4431
03:44:37,631 --> 03:44:39,679
I was pretty thrilled with that

4432
03:44:40,447 --> 03:44:40,959
Zach Smith

4433
03:44:42,239 --> 03:44:45,567
Honestly think we totally clear

4434
03:44:46,847 --> 03:44:49,407
I think that no matter what happened

4435
03:44:49,663 --> 03:44:50,431
Internet debate

4436
03:44:50,687 --> 03:44:52,223
Alex would find something

4437
03:44:52,479 --> 03:44:52,991
The love

4438
03:44:53,247 --> 03:44:53,759
About

4439
03:44:54,015 --> 03:44:55,551
Yeah yeah

4440
03:44:55,807 --> 03:44:57,855
I think it's in this timeline

4441
03:44:58,111 --> 03:44:59,391
Is the

4442
03:45:00,415 --> 03:45:00,927
I do

4443
03:45:02,207 --> 03:45:03,487
He fixated on

4444
03:45:05,535 --> 03:45:06,559
Like now I

4445
03:45:06,815 --> 03:45:12,191
I want, want to go back and watch that debate

4446
03:45:12,447 --> 03:45:12,959
Sissy

4447
03:45:13,215 --> 03:45:13,727
How many things

4448
03:45:13,983 --> 03:45:14,751
Trump said that he

4449
03:45:15,007 --> 03:45:15,775
Would have

4450
03:45:16,031 --> 03:45:16,543
Agreed with versus

4451
03:45:17,823 --> 03:45:18,335
Did

4452
03:45:18,847 --> 03:45:22,431
I have no idea I did go back and look into

4453
03:45:23,199 --> 03:45:23,711
Stivax

4454
03:45:27,039 --> 03:45:29,087
So f****** hot water like 3 months

4455
03:45:29,343 --> 03:45:29,855
For this

4456
03:45:31,903 --> 03:45:32,415
And

4457
03:45:32,671 --> 03:45:35,231
He hasn't answered vax history that goes back

4458
03:45:36,255 --> 03:45:37,535
Like 2,000

4459
03:45:37,791 --> 03:45:40,351
5

4460
03:45:40,863 --> 03:45:42,399
Situation

4461
03:45:42,911 --> 03:45:43,679
This isn't news

4462
03:45:44,191 --> 03:45:46,239
This is just he cited a debate

4463
03:45:46,495 --> 03:45:49,055
Right position is like

4464
03:45:49,311 --> 03:45:50,335
He's going to be attacked

4465
03:45:50,591 --> 03:45:51,103
For this

4466
03:45:51,359 --> 03:45:53,407
But he had been attacked for it already

4467
03:45:53,663 --> 03:45:55,711
He's pretending this is some sort of like

4468
03:45:56,223 --> 03:45:57,759
New character

4469
03:45:58,271 --> 03:45:59,039
Widgets not

4470
03:45:59,551 --> 03:46:00,831
I honestly

4471
03:46:05,183 --> 03:46:06,463
No I don't think this has

4472
03:46:10,815 --> 03:46:12,351
Campaign it hasn't been all about

4473
03:46:14,399 --> 03:46:16,191
It hasn't it hasn't been all about

4474
03:46:16,703 --> 03:46:18,239
Hey he didn't start that

4475
03:46:19,007 --> 03:46:21,055
He's

4476
03:46:23,103 --> 03:46:23,615
Belt

4477
03:46:23,871 --> 03:46:25,151
So I think

4478
03:46:25,407 --> 03:46:27,711
I think if there's a little bit of manipulation

4479
03:46:27,967 --> 03:46:28,479
I'm going on

4480
03:46:35,903 --> 03:46:37,695
Maybe 4 episodes back

4481
03:46:39,487 --> 03:46:40,767
When he made his pivot

4482
03:46:41,023 --> 03:46:42,047
Stop talking

4483
03:46:42,303 --> 03:46:43,839
S*** about Trump

4484
03:46:44,351 --> 03:46:45,375
In terms of his

4485
03:46:45,631 --> 03:46:48,703
Yeah I went back and I did deep research

4486
03:46:49,727 --> 03:46:53,823
And if you have done

4487
03:46:54,079 --> 03:46:56,127
That she would already know that he has

4488
03:46:56,383 --> 03:47:01,503
A history of being anti-vaccination right hasn't been not that for

4489
03:47:01,759 --> 03:47:02,527
Right

4490
03:47:03,295 --> 03:47:03,807
So this

4491
03:47:04,063 --> 03:47:05,599
Isn't that the truth

4492
03:47:06,111 --> 03:47:07,647
Such a luxury for rich

4493
03:47:12,255 --> 03:47:15,839
Oh my kids go to schools where

4494
03:47:16,095 --> 03:47:17,375
Everybody has been vaccinated

4495
03:47:17,631 --> 03:47:18,143
So I don't have

4496
03:47:19,167 --> 03:47:20,191
And they're not pregnant

4497
03:47:20,447 --> 03:47:22,495
Also that this this

4498
03:47:23,007 --> 03:47:23,775
Version of ants

4499
03:47:24,031 --> 03:47:24,543
EFax

4500
03:47:24,799 --> 03:47:25,311
Where's

4501
03:47:25,567 --> 03:47:27,103
I spaced it out / 6

4502
03:47:27,359 --> 03:47:28,127
Years f******

4503
03:47:28,639 --> 03:47:29,151
F*** you

4504
03:47:30,943 --> 03:47:31,711
Light on

4505
03:47:35,039 --> 03:47:36,063
I've established

4506
03:47:36,831 --> 03:47:37,855
I think pretty

4507
03:47:38,111 --> 03:47:38,623
Consistently

4508
03:47:39,135 --> 03:47:41,183
But if your anti-vax

4509
03:47:41,695 --> 03:47:43,231
I hope you kill yourself

4510
03:47:43,487 --> 03:47:44,511
And then kill your children

4511
03:47:46,047 --> 03:47:46,559
That seems hard

4512
03:47:47,071 --> 03:47:48,351
No that's a good order

4513
03:47:49,119 --> 03:47:50,911
Well we all know that Arts

4514
03:47:51,679 --> 03:47:52,191
Still with us

4515
03:47:55,007 --> 03:47:58,591
Yeah and this is Alex

4516
03:48:07,295 --> 03:48:11,391
I guarantee a Donald Trump his friend

4517
03:48:21,887 --> 03:48:28,031
Vaccine

4518
03:48:36,735 --> 03:48:42,879
Donald Trump presidential

4519
03:48:43,135 --> 03:48:45,183
Composition of Liberty

4520
03:48:45,695 --> 03:48:48,767
Now we have come to our only place

4521
03:48:49,023 --> 03:48:49,535
Yeah we

4522
03:48:50,047 --> 03:48:51,071
We've narrowed it down

4523
03:48:53,631 --> 03:48:55,935
Cuz he loves Rand Paul he will

4524
03:48:56,191 --> 03:48:57,215
Very soon

4525
03:48:57,727 --> 03:48:59,007
Humiliated

4526
03:48:59,263 --> 03:48:59,775
Cruise

4527
03:49:00,031 --> 03:49:01,311
Yeah

4528
03:49:02,591 --> 03:49:04,383
The biggest b****** machine

4529
03:49:05,151 --> 03:49:05,919
For Donald Trump

4530
03:49:06,431 --> 03:49:07,199
Which is funny

4531
03:49:07,455 --> 03:49:11,807
But but that is the one that is the one true Joy

4532
03:49:12,831 --> 03:49:13,343
Cruise

4533
03:49:15,903 --> 03:49:16,415
This

4534
03:49:16,671 --> 03:49:17,183
Is

4535
03:49:18,719 --> 03:49:19,231
Like

4536
03:49:19,743 --> 03:49:20,767
I don't know how to say it

4537
03:49:21,535 --> 03:49:22,559
I was right

4538
03:49:25,887 --> 03:49:31,007
My argument so what you're saying is that we began this episode with Dan being right

4539
03:49:31,519 --> 03:49:35,615
And we ended it with Dad but I think I'm right

4540
03:49:35,871 --> 03:49:37,151
Not the way I expected

4541
03:49:38,687 --> 03:49:40,991
Is II predicted earlier

4542
03:49:41,503 --> 03:49:42,783
When Alex

4543
03:49:43,039 --> 03:49:43,807
Lexus

4544
03:49:44,063 --> 03:49:46,623
To trump it will be superficial it'll be

4545
03:49:46,879 --> 03:49:49,695
It'll be about

4546
03:49:49,951 --> 03:49:50,719
He already

4547
03:49:51,231 --> 03:49:51,999
It's not like

4548
03:49:52,255 --> 03:49:53,535
It's not new it's not new

4549
03:49:53,791 --> 03:49:56,351
Yeah sort of done

4550
03:49:56,863 --> 03:49:58,143
But he's not the cheerleader

4551
03:49:58,911 --> 03:50:01,215
He's still just saying these three guys

4552
03:50:01,727 --> 03:50:03,007
Liberty Canada

4553
03:50:03,519 --> 03:50:04,031
He's narrative.

4554
03:50:04,287 --> 03:50:04,799
Yeah

4555
03:50:05,055 --> 03:50:05,567
Riches

4556
03:50:06,591 --> 03:50:07,871
Already f***** up enough

4557
03:50:08,895 --> 03:50:10,431
Yeah like the candy

4558
03:50:11,711 --> 03:50:12,735
I don't understand

4559
03:50:14,527 --> 03:50:16,063
How it is that he

4560
03:50:17,855 --> 03:50:19,391
Professes to be

4561
03:50:19,647 --> 03:50:20,159
Libertarian

4562
03:50:23,231 --> 03:50:24,767
Theoretically nonpar

4563
03:50:25,535 --> 03:50:26,815
And yet at the same time

4564
03:50:27,071 --> 03:50:27,839
Every anime

4565
03:50:28,351 --> 03:50:28,863
Is leftist

4566
03:50:29,119 --> 03:50:30,911
Damn every every

4567
03:50:31,167 --> 03:50:31,679
Beer

4568
03:50:31,935 --> 03:50:32,703
Comes from

4569
03:50:33,471 --> 03:50:34,239
Inclusion

4570
03:50:34,495 --> 03:50:35,007
Every

4571
03:50:35,263 --> 03:50:36,031
Here Comes

4572
03:50:36,287 --> 03:50:36,799
Who's from

4573
03:50:37,055 --> 03:50:38,847
Any kind of like

4574
03:50:39,359 --> 03:50:45,503
We should all be part of the same world now his professed ideology

4575
03:50:45,759 --> 03:50:46,271
In that

4576
03:50:46,783 --> 03:50:50,623
The the globalists are trying to keep

4577
03:50:52,159 --> 03:50:54,207
Inclusion but he knows that it's a globalist

4578
03:50:54,463 --> 03:50:54,975
Plot

4579
03:50:55,487 --> 03:50:55,999
Like

4580
03:50:56,511 --> 03:50:59,071
He talks about a couple times

4581
03:50:59,583 --> 03:51:00,863
I already need sunlight

4582
03:51:01,375 --> 03:51:03,167
Bass f****** ding dong

4583
03:51:03,423 --> 03:51:04,959
A******

4584
03:51:06,239 --> 03:51:10,079
To me it seems like he would wind up coming down

4585
03:51:10,335 --> 03:51:10,847
Sanders

4586
03:51:11,103 --> 03:51:12,127
No

4587
03:51:16,223 --> 03:51:19,295
Ventura is like

4588
03:51:19,551 --> 03:51:21,087
Sanders or Rand Paul

4589
03:51:21,855 --> 03:51:27,487
That's what Ventura is he does Ventura has a philosophy as an ideological consistency

4590
03:51:28,767 --> 03:51:29,535
Alex

4591
03:51:29,791 --> 03:51:30,303
Believe

4592
03:51:30,815 --> 03:51:31,327
Really

4593
03:51:32,607 --> 03:51:35,423
I honestly think what we're coming to

4594
03:51:35,679 --> 03:51:36,703
What I've learned

4595
03:51:37,215 --> 03:51:38,495
From listening to

4596
03:51:39,007 --> 03:51:40,031
These pants

4597
03:51:40,287 --> 03:51:41,311
Like three weeks

4598
03:51:41,823 --> 03:51:43,103
For two weeks that we've covered

4599
03:51:44,383 --> 03:51:45,151
He is a

4600
03:51:46,175 --> 03:51:46,687
Harsh

4601
03:51:47,199 --> 03:51:47,711
Opportunist

4602
03:51:49,503 --> 03:51:50,783
He wants his money

4603
03:51:53,599 --> 03:51:54,879
And I think

4604
03:51:55,391 --> 03:51:56,415
He realized

4605
03:51:58,463 --> 03:52:01,535
When we write the screenplay for our documentary

4606
03:52:02,303 --> 03:52:03,327
It will be the

4607
03:52:03,583 --> 03:52:04,095
The tagline is

4608
03:52:04,607 --> 03:52:05,119
Alex Jones

4609
03:52:06,143 --> 03:52:06,655
He wants his

4610
03:52:08,703 --> 03:52:09,727
Earlier that

4611
03:52:09,983 --> 03:52:11,263
Are being thing where it's like

4612
03:52:11,519 --> 03:52:12,287
He's trying to get

4613
03:52:12,543 --> 03:52:13,055
Mercer

4614
03:52:13,311 --> 03:52:18,687
Trump to try and come in as big-money donors may still be the case

4615
03:52:19,199 --> 03:52:19,711
But

4616
03:52:20,223 --> 03:52:20,735
I think

4617
03:52:21,247 --> 03:52:22,527
He started the million

4618
03:52:22,783 --> 03:52:24,063
$10 campaign

4619
03:52:24,831 --> 03:52:25,599
Like as not having

4620
03:52:26,623 --> 03:52:29,695
In the meantime we've recognized Joe pigs went out there

4621
03:52:29,951 --> 03:52:35,071
And everyone wanted that shirt yeah

4622
03:52:35,583 --> 03:52:36,863
How do we rationalize

4623
03:52:38,143 --> 03:52:39,423
We rationalize it

4624
03:52:39,679 --> 03:52:41,215
There was a debate last night

4625
03:52:41,983 --> 03:52:45,823
He said something if you vaccination that he said Eddie Ray

4626
03:52:46,079 --> 03:52:46,847
Now it's like

4627
03:52:47,359 --> 03:52:47,871
F***

4628
03:52:48,127 --> 03:52:49,663
We soft kill babies

4629
03:52:50,943 --> 03:52:51,711
That he's against

4630
03:52:55,551 --> 03:52:56,831
Maybe

4631
03:52:57,855 --> 03:52:59,903
What kind of

4632
03:53:00,159 --> 03:53:00,927
Farias

4633
03:53:02,719 --> 03:53:04,511
Coronavirus

4634
03:53:05,023 --> 03:53:05,535
That's a good point

4635
03:53:06,047 --> 03:53:06,559
It means

4636
03:53:09,375 --> 03:53:11,423
In order for us to

4637
03:53:11,679 --> 03:53:12,191
2

4638
03:53:14,751 --> 03:53:15,775
Like

4639
03:53:16,287 --> 03:53:16,799
I guess it's

4640
03:53:17,311 --> 03:53:18,335
I guess it's more like

4641
03:53:18,847 --> 03:53:19,615
I feel like

4642
03:53:19,871 --> 03:53:20,639
We need a scoop

4643
03:53:22,687 --> 03:53:23,967
Like I feel like maybe nice

4644
03:53:24,223 --> 03:53:27,551
We need some kind of

4645
03:53:28,319 --> 03:53:28,831
But if it's

4646
03:53:29,087 --> 03:53:31,391
Just wind up being weird shity

4647
03:53:31,903 --> 03:53:33,183
Opportunism

4648
03:53:34,207 --> 03:53:34,719
It bums

4649
03:53:34,975 --> 03:53:41,119
I think some sort of Mercer money sort of like

4650
03:53:41,631 --> 03:53:43,167
Third-party donors like

4651
03:53:43,423 --> 03:53:44,703
Alright now I direct

4652
03:53:45,215 --> 03:53:47,263
Used to be the gold

4653
03:53:47,519 --> 03:53:48,287
But now it's

4654
03:53:51,103 --> 03:53:55,711
Chevron

4655
03:53:59,295 --> 03:53:59,807
Take solace in

4656
03:54:00,063 --> 03:54:00,575
Knowing that

4657
03:54:00,831 --> 03:54:01,343
No one

4658
03:54:01,855 --> 03:54:02,623
Has done

4659
03:54:02,879 --> 03:54:03,647
As much

4660
03:54:03,903 --> 03:54:05,951
Listening to his show as we have

4661
03:54:11,327 --> 03:54:11,839
We do have

4662
03:54:13,119 --> 03:54:13,631
Whatever

4663
03:54:14,399 --> 03:54:15,935
Even if it isn't

4664
03:54:16,447 --> 03:54:18,239
Set the Mercers are the ones who did it

4665
03:54:19,263 --> 03:54:20,031
Trump money

4666
03:54:20,543 --> 03:54:21,823
There's a scoop here

4667
03:54:22,591 --> 03:54:23,103
Cuz

4668
03:54:23,615 --> 03:54:24,383
He didn't

4669
03:54:25,407 --> 03:54:26,175
Care about Trump

4670
03:54:27,455 --> 03:54:27,967
Before

4671
03:54:28,735 --> 03:54:29,503
And now he's

4672
03:54:30,527 --> 03:54:31,551
Is it

4673
03:54:32,063 --> 03:54:33,087
Antivaxer

4674
03:54:34,111 --> 03:54:36,159
He's he's all over the place

4675
03:54:37,439 --> 03:54:38,719
When he becomes

4676
03:54:39,487 --> 03:54:39,999
These

4677
03:54:40,255 --> 03:54:41,023
1770

4678
03:54:41,535 --> 03:54:42,559
6 2.0

4679
03:54:43,071 --> 03:54:43,839
A guy

4680
03:54:46,143 --> 03:54:46,655
Going to be

4681
03:54:46,911 --> 03:54:47,679
It's not because of

4682
03:54:47,935 --> 03:54:50,751
It's not because of things Trump said 5 years ago

4683
03:54:51,263 --> 03:54:51,775
Well that's

4684
03:54:52,031 --> 03:54:53,311
That's the thing that gets

4685
03:54:54,079 --> 03:54:54,591
Is that it

4686
03:54:54,847 --> 03:54:55,615
Seems like right now

4687
03:54:55,871 --> 03:54:56,383
Now he's

4688
03:54:56,639 --> 03:54:57,151
He's going off of

4689
03:54:58,175 --> 03:54:58,687
Says

4690
03:54:59,711 --> 03:55:01,759
Like he's going off of things that truck

4691
03:55:02,015 --> 03:55:04,063
Like Trump says something I like so I

4692
03:55:06,623 --> 03:55:08,927
Trump says I don't like so I don't say nice

4693
03:55:09,951 --> 03:55:10,975
Trump said something alike

4694
03:55:11,231 --> 03:55:13,535
Like that's the problem that I have

4695
03:55:14,047 --> 03:55:15,839
It should be something that is

4696
03:55:16,863 --> 03:55:17,375
Consistent

4697
03:55:17,887 --> 03:55:19,167
And until we

4698
03:55:20,447 --> 03:55:20,959
Assistant

4699
03:55:22,239 --> 03:55:23,263
It just seems like he's

4700
03:55:23,519 --> 03:55:24,287
Bollocks

4701
03:55:24,543 --> 03:55:26,847
Yeah you're a dumb dumb there's never going to be

4702
03:55:27,103 --> 03:55:27,871
There's never been

4703
03:55:28,127 --> 03:55:34,271
No that's fair I've never going to be point with Alex

4704
03:55:35,551 --> 03:55:41,183
I still live in this world

4705
03:55:42,719 --> 03:55:44,511
I still live in the world

4706
03:55:45,535 --> 03:55:48,863
I believe people believe in things and Alex

4707
03:55:49,887 --> 03:55:53,727
You know what you know what that's why you're right about that

4708
03:55:53,983 --> 03:55:54,495
Is that

4709
03:55:56,543 --> 03:55:58,079
Be consistent argument

4710
03:55:58,335 --> 03:56:01,151
Is always people believe

4711
03:56:01,407 --> 03:56:03,455
And Alex doesn't have a beliefs

4712
03:56:04,479 --> 03:56:06,527
Valentine Alex has

4713
03:56:07,807 --> 03:56:09,087
And then we move

4714
03:56:09,343 --> 03:56:11,647
These Rogue he's completely Rogue

4715
03:56:13,951 --> 03:56:16,511
All right. It doesn't matter to move on

4716
03:56:19,327 --> 03:56:20,863
Story

4717
03:56:21,887 --> 03:56:23,423
They got to get a bunch of

4718
03:56:23,679 --> 03:56:26,495
Publicity out of calling Tom Marla p****

4719
03:56:26,751 --> 03:56:31,871
Right and no one on their side knows that they canceled the fight

4720
03:56:32,127 --> 03:56:33,151

4721
03:56:33,663 --> 03:56:34,175

4726
03:56:43,391 --> 03:56:44,415

4727
03:56:44,671 --> 03:56:45,695
Everything is b*******

4728
03:56:45,951 --> 03:56:47,231

03:56:47,487 --> 03:56:49,279
Will be back with the next

4730
03:56:49,535 --> 03:56:52,095
Stage of this investigation

4731
03:56:52,351 --> 03:56:53,119
Chip I don't want

4732
03:56:54,911 --> 03:56:59,007
Interesting with so far

4733
03:56:59,519 --> 03:57:00,031
To this

4734
03:57:00,543 --> 03:57:01,055
Circumstance

4735
03:57:02,079 --> 03:57:02,591
Been buried

4736
03:57:03,103 --> 03:57:08,479
The actual things that are happening in the administration

4737
03:57:08,735 --> 03:57:11,039
Scaramucci's

4738
03:57:12,063 --> 03:57:13,343
That's because Sean Spicer was a

4739
03:57:13,599 --> 03:57:14,367
Deep state agent

4740
03:57:14,623 --> 03:57:16,159
Hayward

4741
03:57:16,927 --> 03:57:17,439

4743
03:57:20,511 --> 03:57:21,279
Like

4744
03:57:22,815 --> 03:57:24,607
Who would get him inside information

4745
03:57:25,375 --> 03:57:26,143
How do you die

4746
03:57:28,703 --> 03:57:29,471
Was working

4747
03:57:29,727 --> 03:57:31,007

03:57:31,775 --> 03:57:32,799
Bananas

4749
03:57:33,055 --> 03:57:35,615
This week as this episode comes out

4750
03:57:37,151 --> 03:57:39,455

4751
03:57:40,735 --> 03:57:41,247

03:57:45,855 --> 03:57:47,647
So we'll see

4754
03:57:48,415 --> 03:57:48,927
Of course

4755
03:57:49,439 --> 03:57:50,719
No they're going to be pardoned

4756
03:57:53,791 --> 03:57:59,423
But if you don't want to be pardoned you should go to our website I don't know

4757
03:57:59,679 --> 03:58:01,983
No I refuse that transition

4758
03:58:02,239 --> 03:58:08,383
Reject slightly buzzed activity on the word Ridge

4759
03:58:09,151 --> 03:58:14,271
You want to reject something on the website

4760
03:58:15,039 --> 03:58:20,159

How important it is to us

4766
03:58:36,031 --> 03:58:39,871
And if you are not a policy wonk

4767
03:58:40,127 --> 03:58:40,639

4768
03:58:40,895 --> 03:58:42,175
To be click on that button

4769
03:58:42,431 --> 03:58:44,223
And you will kill Jeff

4770
03:58:46,271 --> 03:58:52,415
What hold on hold on

4771
03:58:53,951 --> 03:58:55,999
You will be granted access to

4772
03:58:56,255 --> 03:58:57,791
Now it's 10 episodes

4773
03:58:58,047 --> 03:59:00,863
Want you to think me and Marty DeRosa

4774
03:59:01,119 --> 03:59:02,399
Conspiracy theory podcast

4775
03:59:02,655 --> 03:59:06,495
Little bonus for you're a smarty friend of the showing

4776
03:59:06,751 --> 03:59:12,895
And there are other episodes that will be added eventually once I find him in my art Drive

4777
03:59:13,151 --> 03:59:17,759
I have an external hard drives that has other

4778
03:59:18,015 --> 03:59:18,527
We'll figure it out

4779
03:59:19,039 --> 03:59:20,831
But

4780
03:59:21,087 --> 03:59:25,183
Twitter is at knowledge underscore fight and we're on Facebook

4781
03:59:27,231 --> 03:59:29,023
Alright

4782
03:59:29,279 --> 03:59:29,791
Why this

4783
03:59:30,047 --> 03:59:34,143
Entire after they did that last episode

4784
03:59:34,399 --> 03:59:34,911
Intriguing

4785
03:59:35,167 --> 03:59:35,679
Is it diarrhea

4786
03:59:35,935 --> 03:59:39,263
Episode 18 on Facebook like I said

4787
03:59:43,871 --> 03:59:47,199
There's something about their algorithm where if you give us like

4788
03:59:47,711 --> 03:59:48,223
Stars

4789
03:59:50,271 --> 03:59:50,783
Indeed

4790
03:59:51,039 --> 03:59:54,111
Apologize this episode has been

4791
03:59:54,623 --> 03:59:57,695
Jesus Christ, we are at 4 hours

4792
04:00:01,023 --> 04:00:01,535
Not true

4793
04:00:01,791 --> 04:00:02,815
Jesus Christ

4794
04:00:03,071 --> 04:00:05,631
Really we've not breach

4795
04:00:06,143 --> 04:00:08,191
4

4796
04:00:08,447 --> 04:00:14,335
The Joe Rogan was the closest I think it's closed

4797
04:00:14,847 --> 04:00:15,359
Discover 24

4798
04:00:16,127 --> 04:00:17,407
I think if you would not

4799
04:00:17,919 --> 04:00:19,455
Disrupt as me so many times

4800
04:00:22,527 --> 04:00:28,159
Don't pretend

4801
04:00:28,671 --> 04:00:31,743
I was going to make this episode 4 hours no matter what have

4802
04:00:33,535 --> 04:00:34,047
A good time

4803
04:00:46,335 --> 04:00:48,895
You are ruining the ending

4804
04:00:52,479 --> 04:00:53,503
UFO

4805
04:01:00,159 --> 04:01:00,671
This one guy

4806
04:01:00,927 --> 04:01:01,695
What

4807
04:01:02,719 --> 04:01:03,231
Who is he

4808
04:01:05,279 --> 04:01:06,815
The younger the older

4809
04:01:07,071 --> 04:01:09,375
It's really old really old

4810
04:01:09,631 --> 04:01:10,143
Anti AIDS

4811
04:01:14,751 --> 04:01:18,079
Yes what about

4812
04:01:19,103 --> 04:01:19,615
The end of the night

4813
04:01:19,871 --> 04:01:21,663
Okay

4814
04:01:22,175 --> 04:01:26,783
The bathtub it has gone so far

4815
04:01:27,039 --> 04:01:28,831
He said he was going to the bathroom

4816
04:01:36,767 --> 04:01:37,279
Holding

4817
04:01:39,327 --> 04:01:42,911
