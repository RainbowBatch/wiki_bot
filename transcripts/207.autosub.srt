00:00:04,096 --> 00:00:10,240
Alexandra Thurston color

2
00:00:20,224 --> 00:00:21,504
Beginnings

3
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:27,904
The same thing so I wanted to drink my roller coaster

4
00:00:32,256 --> 00:00:34,048
As far as the first shot in the dark

5
00:00:35,072 --> 00:00:35,584
A blue sky

6
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,120
There's no bad idea

7
00:00:37,376 --> 00:00:39,936
Okay baby

8
00:00:40,448 --> 00:00:41,984
Let's

9
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:45,312
Thank you for the

10
00:00:45,568 --> 00:00:46,592
What's going on man

11
00:00:46,848 --> 00:00:52,992
Take me to Best Western

12
00:00:54,528 --> 00:00:57,856
Although I am starting to like the fact that every vague question

13
00:00:59,904 --> 00:01:04,256
It resulted in like long story longer than expected

14
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:10,144
We don't want to give it a shot

15
00:01:11,424 --> 00:01:12,192
Yeah they're go

16
00:01:12,448 --> 00:01:13,216
When did you first try

17
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:14,752
Versed

18
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:16,032
Oh that's an interesting question

19
00:01:17,568 --> 00:01:19,360
But I don't think I have a good answer for that

20
00:01:19,616 --> 00:01:24,736
I mean I mean I liked growing up and what have you sure

21
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:29,344
Remember my friends had like Dave's

22
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,624
Sauce

23
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:32,928
Try that

24
00:01:33,184 --> 00:01:33,696
That's just

25
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:35,488
Gross that's just like really discussed

26
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:37,024
Never heard of David

27
00:01:37,792 --> 00:01:38,560
It was like an old Pro

28
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:39,328
Frank sauce

29
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:47,008
He's staying with her soup

30
00:01:47,264 --> 00:01:49,568
Superhot

31
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:54,176
So they are the like peanut brittle

32
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:56,992
Condiments

33
00:01:57,248 --> 00:01:57,760
Sure

34
00:01:58,016 --> 00:01:59,808
Sure they're always filled with exploding

35
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:01,088
Yes yes

36
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:03,136
The camp

37
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:06,720
The last like 45 years ago

38
00:02:07,488 --> 00:02:08,512
I've gotten interested in

39
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:13,120
I just asked

40
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:16,448
Play everybody we were in Austin and you spent

41
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:23,104
God knows mirror an hour in the hot sauce store Ryan everything

42
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:24,896
I find that I find that in

43
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:29,504
Terms of a turning into a story but Noble effort

44
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:33,600
I got this great question it's not bad

45
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:36,416
Impact

46
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:37,952
They are

47
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:39,488
They are good

48
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:42,816

Number names

58
00:03:26,848 --> 00:03:32,992
Except for Andrew Wright Elementary School

59
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:39,392
Andrew Breitbart cuz your dad and I know that your credit card doesn't work anymore

60
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:43,488
That's absolutely true

61
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:53,216
Iran podcast

62
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:57,824
To one of our other side world

63
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:05,248
Ocean Project Camelot

64
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:07,808
Putting out stuff

65
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:11,136
Putting out a lot of content lately

66
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:12,416
Where is Buffet

67
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:18,815
A little bit of a dry spell she wasn't putting out a whole lot

68
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:22,399
Project Camelot in like 3 or 4 weeks

69
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:26,239
Assume that she didn't put out enough high-quality

70
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:30,591
Back to fighting shape

71
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:32,127
She's

72
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:35,967
Season 4

73
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:37,247
The fences

74
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:39,807
Also there's nothing is going to come up on this episode

75
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:45,439
The f****** funniest things I've ever heard in my life

76
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:47,487
But also at the same time

77
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:50,047
The reason we haven't been going back to Jim Bakker so much

78
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:51,583
I think we've dealt with

79
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:58,495
Like I've listened to a bunch more episodes and it's so much crap salesmanship

80
00:04:58,751 --> 00:04:59,519
So pathetic

81
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:02,079
I've listened to him and Michael

82
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:03,359
How would we talk about

83
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:05,407
Exactly the same thing as

84
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:09,247
Bunch of the other episodes

85
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:15,647
Oxytocin

86
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:19,231
But I do Reserve

87
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:22,815
The right to if you have someone else on like Apollo

88
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:29,215
Intersection of

89
00:05:29,983 --> 00:05:31,519
Doomsday Faith bucket

90
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:32,799
In politics

91
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:36,639
That's worthwhile

92
00:05:37,151 --> 00:05:39,455
I don't want to wait hours and hours of my time

93
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:42,015
Like fishing in this dry well

94
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:43,039
Of Jim Bakker

95
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:44,831
It's a waste of my time

96
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:51,487
That's where you want me to be pissed off

97
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:56,607
Start a part of the charm of the show

98
00:05:56,863 --> 00:05:58,143
Yourself so we don't have to

99
00:05:58,399 --> 00:05:59,167
Yeah I guess so

100
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:04,543
Sort of bullpen

101
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:05,311
The roster

102
00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:07,103
I've known Alex Jones.

103
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:08,383
Future

104
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:10,687
Augustus off air

105
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:15,295
Bit more about Joe Rogan

106
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:18,879
A little bit of his catalog

107
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:19,647
Hi

108
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:20,927
And go through some of that stuff

109
00:06:22,975 --> 00:06:24,767
And so I'm not ready to do that today

110
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:27,583
We talked about Project Camelot

111
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:28,607
And like I said

112
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:30,911
One of the funniest f****** things I've ever seen in my life

113
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:35,007
Maybe during an episode with

114
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:35,775
Jordan Peterson

115
00:06:36,031 --> 00:06:42,175
Not worthwhile Peterson

116
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:46,271
And God bless him for it

117
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:47,551
Create other people

118
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:49,343
It's already been done

119
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:51,903
But I think there's a story going on with Joe Rogan

120
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:52,671
Hafthor

121
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:54,207
He's alright

122
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:55,999
Not be adjacent

123
00:06:56,255 --> 00:06:59,071
Behavior that is not being told

124
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:03,679
That is interesting sound through analyzer

125
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:06,751
That I think is worth

126
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:09,567
Future

127
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:11,103
Look

128
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:14,687
But if you want to support the show

129
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:15,455
It helps a lot

130
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:16,223
Towards us

131
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:16,991
Jamaican D's

132
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:19,039
Goals that we have a reality

133
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:22,111
You know bacon to work

134
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:23,135
Redan easier

135
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:28,511
We've shout it out today and everyday

136
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:32,607
Sports show

137
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:36,703
Perfect

138
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:38,239
Here is an out-of-context dropped

139
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:39,007
From Today Show

140
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:41,055
I have remote View

141
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:43,103
Okay

142
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:46,431
Alright Jerry

143
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:52,319
You can just look up

144
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:55,391
She's got a remote view that Moon

145
00:07:55,647 --> 00:07:57,951
The Moon

146
00:07:58,207 --> 00:08:01,535
Everybody like if your remote viewing cuz that means you stood on the moon

147
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:05,631
She has the experience of her astral body being on the moon

148
00:08:05,887 --> 00:08:06,399
I guess

149
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:07,935
Something like that

150
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:10,495
I would I would assume it's not

151
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:11,775
Doubt

152
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:14,335
Buccaneers

153
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:19,711
There's going to be a theme on today's episode

154
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:24,575
Play 3 episode

155
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:27,135
So Jordan today is episode

156
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:29,439
It starts unlike

157
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:31,999
Any other episode of Project Camelot I've ever heard

158
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:33,535
Eden vet

159
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:36,351
I don't know why Carrie didn't just say it

160
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:38,399
Start half an hour later

161
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:41,215
Cassidy

162
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:42,239
Has a giant races

163
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:48,895
I'm sure Cassidy from Project Camelot and

164
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:55,807
Very happy to be here tonight but unfortunately my gas brewski Saul I think he didn't

165
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:56,575
Get my

166
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:57,599
Message

167
00:08:57,855 --> 00:09:01,183
Sort of scheduling him for an agreed-upon time

168
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:04,255
So I texted him over on his

169
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:05,791
Channel where he just

170
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:09,631
Maybe he'll see my comment

171
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:14,751
Under that video reminding him and trying to see if

172
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:18,335
Process to the time when he was going to come on the show

173
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:19,103
Alright

174
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:26,015
So if I understand correctly we got a no-show

175
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:32,415
This guy was supposed to be on the show

176
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:35,487
Bruce don't like the amazing Bruce

177
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:42,143
Everything is Everything

178
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:43,423
Resubmission

179
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:44,959
His name is Bruce Swartz

180
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:51,359
Message Tim whatever message

181
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:59,295
Was live streaming at the time unloading a video or something

182
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:00,831
The video hey

183
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:05,183
Remember how you were going to do my show at this exact moment right now

184
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:08,255
And so she still went on air

185
00:10:08,511 --> 00:10:10,815
That's the part that's confusing to me is like

186
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:12,351
You can just not do it

187
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:19,519
Is he not do the show

188
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:24,383
I from from everything I can tell no it's pretty it's pretty inconsistent

189
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:30,783
Like three or four in a week and then none

190
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:38,207
Pirate

191
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:43,583
I didn't show up I got the night off

192
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:44,863
But I also

193
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:48,447
I admire the hustle I admire the you like

194
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:53,567
No we are doing the show

195
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:55,871
Show dance

196
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:58,943
Show Business absolutely

197
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:04,575
It's your business not sure

198
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:05,855
Hey

Beeswax

201
00:11:11,487 --> 00:11:15,327
Because the guy isn't that means Terry

202
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:17,887
Needs to spend the beginning of the show

203
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:21,983
How old is basically doing some housekeeping

204
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:28,895
Love saying like a by the way aliens are real guys I know we're waiting for our gas but let me just run down the list

205
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:32,223
Things weather weapons totally real that's what happened

206
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:34,527
North Carolina I don't even know if it's still there

207
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:39,391
They are actually in the hurricane and that is why

208
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:40,671
People are dying they are being

209
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:42,719
Raptor

210
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:43,487
Retain

211
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:47,839
That's a next movie

212
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:49,375
Channel movie right now

213
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:51,423
Dammit they should hire her

214
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:56,543
Yeah I totally fell for like a question

215
00:11:57,055 --> 00:11:59,103
And so she just sort of rambles and checks and on

216
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:00,383
Some things that are happening

217
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:03,199
Around the world of Project Camelot

218
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:07,807
I do want to say that Eddie page had his Facebook

219
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:09,343
Yes toothpaste

220
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:11,391
If I understand correctly

221
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:15,743
Haven't taken down last night

222
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:17,791
Cigar

223
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:20,095
Something you said

224
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:22,911
Did not agree with the powers-that-be

225
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:25,471
And or want to be or

226
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:29,055
Think they are I would have going to call him and

227
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:30,335
So Gone

228
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:32,127
His his channels gone

229
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:33,151
And

230
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:37,759
That's not even getting like Stripes that's not a normal procedure

231
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:40,831
That is basically the only people that have

232
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:42,623
That would be

233
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:43,647
The CIA

234
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:50,303
Although I obviously Eddie page is now hitting a nerve

235
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:53,375
Okay

236
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:54,399
Racism

237
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:57,471
It is the idea of a society getting along

238
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:01,311
Facebook

239
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:04,383
YouTube

240
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:06,943
8

241
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:09,503
So it's interesting

242
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:13,599
10th of September Kerry Cassidy put a Blog up on her website

243
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:16,415
New info res

244
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:18,719
Anunnaki or pleiadian

245
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:25,887
Heritage

246
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:26,911
Has turned

247
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:27,935
Freddy

248
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:30,239
It turns out

249
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:33,311
Things are falling apart but

250
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:37,407
This is prior to September

251
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:43,295
Okay alright

252
00:13:44,063 --> 00:13:46,111
Caribou

253
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:46,879
Facebook

254
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:49,951
And if a CIA conspiracy

255
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:51,487
Next

256
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:56,095
Okay alright I like it

257
00:13:56,351 --> 00:13:57,375
So now what

258
00:13:57,631 --> 00:13:58,399
Turns out

259
00:13:58,655 --> 00:14:01,471
Is that going to read this

260
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:02,239
The quote

261
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:03,263
From

262
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:04,287
From her

263
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:05,055
Blog post

264
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:07,615
Do you who works with Eddie

265
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:09,919
Turn on the YouTube videos

266
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:13,247
YouTube channel as well as

267
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:14,783
Project Aquarius

268
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:15,807
And Michael Wolff

269
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:19,135
On the Earth

270
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:22,975
One of Eddie's Palladium brothers and Michael

271
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:23,743
Another brother

272
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:26,047
Who's been in contact with re

273
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:27,583
From shattering The Matrix

274
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:31,167
Just another online alright alright

275
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:31,935
I'm tracking

276
00:14:32,447 --> 00:14:33,215
So

277
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:36,287
Here's why they contacted

278
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:37,823
And told them to take stuff down

279
00:14:39,359 --> 00:14:41,663
He went on someone else's show

280
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:44,479
Purported

281
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:48,831
To show a photo inside a pleiadian

282
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:49,855
Mothership

283
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:54,975
Showed this picture on this other person's show

284
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:56,767
And it turns out that if you

285
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:59,327
Reverse image search this or if you just

286
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:01,631
Kind of know

287
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:05,727
Took this photo is a snapshot from a video game called Secret World Legends

288
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:13,407
God dammit Eddie you're being too specific again

289
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:18,015
Goddamnit the internet will find you also in a previous video Eddie claims

290
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:19,807
Uso to be

291
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:23,391
But it's a photo taken

292
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:31,583
Information that we haven't handled

293
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:33,119
If this is true

294
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:35,167
Is Carrie not affiliated

295
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:40,031
Well I never really went too far

296
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:42,335
But I don't think that you would like

297
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:45,151
I think that was more of like I aren't you pretty

298
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:47,711
That kind of thing

299
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:50,015
Aren't you

300
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:51,551
Noble as a pleiadian

301
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:52,831
Or something like that

302
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:53,599
I don't like it

303
00:15:56,927 --> 00:15:58,463
S*** this blog post

304
00:15:58,719 --> 00:15:59,487
Is f******

305
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:00,255
Crazy

306
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:01,535
Because

307
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:05,119
It's very clear that any right-thinking person

308
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:09,215
That what's going on is Betty Page pictures of UFOs

309
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:14,847
Snapshots from video games

310
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:18,175
Just like his metals are representative of the real metal

311
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:20,479
So are these pictures representative

312
00:16:20,991 --> 00:16:22,271
Not

313
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:24,063
The ID

314
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:25,087
That they

315
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:27,903
There's

316
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:31,999
Here's where Carrie goes with it

317
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:37,119
Eli's recently pictures of crap

318
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:38,399
Control panel

319
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:42,495
On an interview he did with another host called Ari from shattering The Matrix

320
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:44,543
I'm in contact with her and apparently

321
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:46,591
He claimed the photo from

322
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:48,895
If I understand what they're saying

323
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:50,943
Is the inside of a Palladium ship

324
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:57,599
Either the photo is from a game

325
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:05,791
Parenthetically assuming the gamers didn't have access to classified photos of real Plies

326
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:10,399
Or

327
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:16,287
It is possible Eddie is deceived because the inside of the ship looked so much like his memory he mistook it for

328
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:22,175
Should have taken the first out that second one is tough

329
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:27,295
Yeah might be a bridge too far

330
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:33,695
Is clear evidence that he is a con man he's passing off things as I got part of my story

331
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:37,023
Episode

332
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:38,815
This is my life story

333
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:40,095
And stuff like that

334
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:43,423
In reality that's not will get scary

335
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:44,191
To be like

336
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:45,471
Oono

337
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:46,239
What's going on

338
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:47,007
Dear

339
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:50,847
From the

340
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:53,663
I've made very public statement

341
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:54,943
Revealing my position

342
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:56,479
Eddie's convoluted claims

343
00:17:56,735 --> 00:17:58,015
The future diabolical

344
00:17:58,271 --> 00:18:01,599
If there is a problem is religious overlay

345
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:02,879
Advise you must

346
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:09,535
Control in a punishing God to such an extent

347
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:13,631
To be a Punisher of humanity

348
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:14,655
As well as

349
00:18:14,911 --> 00:18:15,935
Confusion or calling himself

350
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:16,703
Abaddon

351
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:23,359
Apparently he has in his mind over this appears

352
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:25,663
Claims in the same breath that he loves Humanity

353
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:27,711
And that he and his father wants

354
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:28,479
Just save them

355
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:31,295
Cuz of his things

356
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:37,951
He said on the show where he talks about his father and the wrathful extermination of the

357
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:40,767
Draco

358
00:18:41,023 --> 00:18:41,791
It being some sort of

359
00:18:42,047 --> 00:18:42,815
Light being like

360
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:45,887
She knows the Pleiadians to be

361
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:47,679
Thank you must be Anunnaki

362
00:18:55,103 --> 00:18:56,127
You can't just break up with

363
00:18:58,175 --> 00:18:58,687
Quote

364
00:18:58,943 --> 00:19:00,223
This is Keith

365
00:19:00,735 --> 00:19:01,759
Vintage King

366
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:07,903
His father is just a pleiadian rulers employment

367
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:10,719
Not even the larger he claims

368
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:12,511
Not all the planets within the

369
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:16,607
Is grouper working with many other races within the galactic

370
00:19:16,863 --> 00:19:17,375
Expiration

371
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:21,215
Which by the way according to Asiana.

372
00:19:21,471 --> 00:19:22,751
Are in violation of the

373
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:23,775
The peace treaty with

374
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:26,847
Hitmen of the races are part of the luciferian Rebellion

375
00:19:27,103 --> 00:19:29,151
They are not aligned with the guardian Alliance

376
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:35,551
Which is a group of races were safeguarding Humanity about the guardian Alliance

377
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:36,319
Versus the galactic

378
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:37,087
Confederation

379
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:40,415
However to my knowledge he did not bother to read the Voyager book

380
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:45,791
What an a******

381
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:50,143
I'm telling you right now this is the only reason to not like it

382
00:19:50,911 --> 00:19:56,287
If Eddie is a member of the warrior Clan known as the Anunnaki and is one of the hybrid reptilians then

383
00:19:58,079 --> 00:19:59,359
Are all his brothers

384
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:00,127
Sisters

385
00:20:00,383 --> 00:20:02,175
Classic if then state

386
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:06,271
Bear dance

387
00:20:06,527 --> 00:20:10,879
The testimony by Eddie on my recent interview about the Pleiadians shooting down our satellite

388
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:11,903
Act of War

389
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:12,927
Is perplexing

390
00:20:13,183 --> 00:20:13,951
And what would happen

391
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:14,975
To figure out if this was

392
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:16,255
Disabled

393
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:18,559
Programs battlegroup communication

394
00:20:18,815 --> 00:20:21,887
In support of The Darkside Illuminati Draco takeover

395
00:20:22,143 --> 00:20:25,471
Or whether the satellite

396
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:30,591
And therefore belong to the enemy of humanity

397
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:34,175
!!

398
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:36,479
A lot of!

399
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:43,391
Chanel

400
00:20:43,647 --> 00:20:45,439
I think you start to see

401
00:20:45,695 --> 00:20:47,999
The issue that Carrie has backed ourselves into

402
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:51,327
In that she can no longer say that Eddie is a liar

403
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:53,631
She has to make him evil now

404
00:20:56,447 --> 00:20:58,751
She now has created a super villain

405
00:20:59,263 --> 00:21:00,799
Because I couldn't until like

406
00:21:01,055 --> 00:21:02,335
Really read into that

407
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:11,807
Yes in fact I am

408
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:17,440
Oh my God a showdown between Good and Evil

409
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:23,840
We don't know for sure yet whether or not carry herself

410
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:25,120
Is good or evil

411
00:21:25,376 --> 00:21:27,680
Extrude

412
00:21:27,936 --> 00:21:30,240
I don't know she's like a part of the globe

413
00:21:30,496 --> 00:21:36,640
Federation or the alliance what happened

414
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:41,504
Do you have no standards if we all talked to

415
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:47,904
Alright well now my narratives going down this road and he's a f******

416
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:51,488
What do I do

417
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:54,816
You've actually Anunnaki

418
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,544
This is like that now you didn't shoot me

419
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,552
You spend so much time talking about Alex Jones

420
00:22:16,576 --> 00:22:20,416
Really matter

421
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:23,488
Halo

422
00:22:25,024 --> 00:22:25,792
That's my life

423
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:28,352
Bishop things on alien planets

424
00:22:28,864 --> 00:22:29,632
Alright buddy go to bed

425
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,936
Go to bed already

426
00:22:32,192 --> 00:22:36,800
You're no longer useful so

427
00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:41,408
He's super useful now as the bad guy

428
00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:44,224
But not on the ship

429
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,760
Well I mean maybe

430
00:22:46,528 --> 00:22:52,416
What is the head of reconciliation episode not a Showdown episode

431
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:56,256
Absolutely

432
00:22:56,512 --> 00:22:59,840
Terry takes Guinness in the production room

433
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:07,264
Would wind up

434
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,288
Switching places

435
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,848
They don't

436
00:23:12,128 --> 00:23:16,736
Mark Richards put his mind at 2 or or

437
00:23:16,992 --> 00:23:23,136
Prepaid claims

438
00:23:23,392 --> 00:23:27,232
I haven't felt like myself ever since I went to Vacaville

439
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:33,632
Resale good

440
00:23:33,888 --> 00:23:36,448
Perfect Minerva get on that

441
00:23:36,704 --> 00:23:40,032
So many possibilities for this narrative to go in better directions

442
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,640
That would be

443
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:47,712
Cuz Eddie

444
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:50,016
To pull it off with a complete lack of

445
00:23:50,784 --> 00:23:54,112
And flexibility

446
00:23:55,904 --> 00:23:59,744
I shut down those satellites totally thinking that that would be a fine thing

447
00:24:03,328 --> 00:24:03,840
Better

448
00:24:04,096 --> 00:24:04,608
That's her out

449
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,656
Her out is on the show

450
00:24:07,168 --> 00:24:08,192
He said that he was

451
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:09,216
He shut down the

452
00:24:09,472 --> 00:24:09,984
Satellites

453
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,288
Now it turns out he's a liar

454
00:24:12,544 --> 00:24:13,568
Head full of s***

455
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:19,200
She's like that she agreed with him

456
00:24:19,456 --> 00:24:19,968
On every

457
00:24:20,224 --> 00:24:22,016
X

458
00:24:22,272 --> 00:24:23,808
Yeah it's short span

459
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:26,624
Like that you never does that with that

460
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,672
Pushed into the front of the line

461
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:32,512
He's a f******

462
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,560
Definitive bulshit artist

463
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:36,864
The UK

464
00:24:38,912 --> 00:24:40,192
Misinformation

465
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:41,472
I like that

466
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,800
At the very least listen to the most

467
00:24:45,056 --> 00:24:46,336
Recent episode of Bettie Page on

468
00:24:47,104 --> 00:24:47,616
Haha

469
00:24:50,688 --> 00:24:55,808
She didn't though because she's recording this episode and saying that

470
00:24:56,064 --> 00:24:57,088
The CIA what have you

471
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,696
Tracy

472
00:25:01,952 --> 00:25:04,768
We going to be involved with this anymore at all lights

473
00:25:07,328 --> 00:25:11,936
This is how she spends her time with her guest camp

474
00:25:12,192 --> 00:25:14,496
He starts talking a little bit about her she didn't interview with

475
00:25:14,752 --> 00:25:15,264
Somebody else

476
00:25:16,032 --> 00:25:21,152
And we're not getting it.

477
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:24,992
I will say that I did an interview with

478
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:28,576
Trottier is his name

479
00:25:29,856 --> 00:25:30,880
And II

480
00:25:31,136 --> 00:25:31,904
Posted it

481
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,696
Yesterday the link to his

482
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:41,376
And then he tried to post it on YouTube and he got a

483
00:25:41,632 --> 00:25:43,168
Immediate message

484
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,984
Saying that that radio show with me

485
00:25:46,496 --> 00:25:48,800
Band and all country

486
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:56,736
And I get a kick out of that cuz it's like how dangerous am I right

487
00:25:56,992 --> 00:26:00,064
This guy is kind of mainstream

488
00:26:00,576 --> 00:26:02,624
Stoic

489
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:09,280
Looks like that was too much for them

490
00:26:10,048 --> 00:26:10,816
They couldn't handle it

491
00:26:15,424 --> 00:26:16,960
There's nothing I would love more than

492
00:26:17,216 --> 00:26:17,984
Dog interrupting

493
00:26:18,752 --> 00:26:20,288
I don't think that there's

494
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:21,824
I don't think anyone's band

495
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:22,592
All country

496
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,664
Not every country

497
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,712
More countries are very different standards

498
00:26:27,968 --> 00:26:28,736
For what

499
00:26:29,248 --> 00:26:30,272
He passes for accepted

500
00:26:30,784 --> 00:26:33,344
Country has different laws

501
00:26:34,624 --> 00:26:35,904
You like that yeah

502
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:42,304
For all the time like the first amendment and countries not called the United States

503
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:45,632
The Baseline

504
00:26:46,144 --> 00:26:51,008
Okay alright interview with this guy

505
00:26:51,264 --> 00:26:51,776
And like

506
00:26:52,032 --> 00:26:53,568
Attack didn't work out a glitch

507
00:26:53,824 --> 00:26:54,336
Something like that

508
00:26:54,592 --> 00:26:57,152
He's trying to be polite or it was a shity interview

509
00:26:57,408 --> 00:27:00,224
Omigod I tried to post it

510
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:01,760
Yeah I guess

511
00:27:02,016 --> 00:27:04,576
Yeah that

512
00:27:05,088 --> 00:27:11,232
Look at at detecting workout Rebecca

513
00:27:16,864 --> 00:27:22,752
Look what are you in Luxemburg band you know you got to stop they don't even I don't even know what they do there

514
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:23,520
It's just such

515
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:25,056
It's just a couple of guys

516
00:27:25,312 --> 00:27:25,824
Luxembourg

517
00:27:27,872 --> 00:27:28,896
Garbage

518
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:31,968
YouTube

519
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:36,832
And YouTube says it's been banded all country

520
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,112
Noah

521
00:27:41,696 --> 00:27:44,512
Okay what other streaming services

522
00:27:47,584 --> 00:27:51,680
Spotify

523
00:27:51,936 --> 00:27:52,960
Who gives a s***

524
00:27:53,216 --> 00:27:57,056
Put it on Mike Adams real. Video never f****** b*******

525
00:27:57,312 --> 00:27:59,616
Play still exist

526
00:27:59,872 --> 00:28:01,920
Anyway all that stuff

527
00:28:02,944 --> 00:28:05,504
Now we find out the Carrie is writing a book

528
00:28:06,272 --> 00:28:08,064
Oh that's not a trouble in Paradise

529
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:10,880
And I'm also finding out that

530
00:28:11,136 --> 00:28:16,256
Apparently my book is like coming in at like 700 Pages or something really crazy

531
00:28:18,048 --> 00:28:20,096
I don't think

532
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,264
Okay something

533
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:29,312
Are there

534
00:28:29,824 --> 00:28:30,592
Cix

535
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:36,480
Okay so anyway I just want to say that

536
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:41,344
Let me see if it looks like he is showing up

537
00:28:58,496 --> 00:28:59,008
Hello

538
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:06,432
Cherry hi I'm so sorry

539
00:29:06,944 --> 00:29:09,760
I was waiting for the reply

540
00:29:10,272 --> 00:29:13,344
I wasn't sure if you were going to call or not I am here

541
00:29:13,856 --> 00:29:17,696
It looks like for whatever it I can tell Carrie didn't send a reply

542
00:29:17,952 --> 00:29:20,000
Confirm

543
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:24,864
She just assumed

544
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:28,704
Aaron went on air

545
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:29,728
So he calls

546
00:29:29,984 --> 00:29:32,288
Bruce Lee it was most likely

547
00:29:32,544 --> 00:29:33,056
She sent him a message

548
00:29:33,312 --> 00:29:34,336
Do you want to do it at

549
00:29:34,592 --> 00:29:35,872
And he was like

550
00:29:36,896 --> 00:29:38,176
I mean I would probably

551
00:29:39,456 --> 00:29:40,736
Say what's best for you

552
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:43,552
Shawty

553
00:29:43,808 --> 00:29:46,368
Lack of confirmation in bed

554
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,672
Structure me to expect from

555
00:29:49,184 --> 00:29:52,000
None of it surprises me

556
00:29:52,256 --> 00:29:55,072
But the

557
00:29:55,328 --> 00:29:56,352
She shares with

558
00:29:56,864 --> 00:29:57,888
That is for sure

559
00:29:58,144 --> 00:30:04,032
Alex like checking his phone on air

560
00:30:06,848 --> 00:30:07,360
The play

561
00:30:07,616 --> 00:30:08,384
Even the mix

562
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,152
Okay

563
00:30:09,408 --> 00:30:10,688
This guy

564
00:30:10,944 --> 00:30:11,712
Does he

565
00:30:14,272 --> 00:30:15,808
Everything all right I don't even think

566
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:16,576
Make that he would make

567
00:30:17,088 --> 00:30:18,880
I don't want to tell you anything I just wanted

568
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:20,928
Carrie is going to

569
00:30:21,184 --> 00:30:21,952
Give him a little bit of

570
00:30:22,208 --> 00:30:23,488
Introduction here that I can

571
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:27,072
Greg

572
00:30:27,328 --> 00:30:30,144
So it's great to have you here let me just

573
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:32,192
You like a real brief

574
00:30:32,448 --> 00:30:33,472
I got your introduction

575
00:30:33,728 --> 00:30:36,032
Operate a Celestron

576
00:30:36,288 --> 00:30:39,872
1400hd computerized 14 inch telescope

577
00:30:40,128 --> 00:30:40,640
38

578
00:30:42,432 --> 00:30:48,576
Optical to with DSLR and adapter

579
00:30:48,832 --> 00:30:51,136
24 megapixel camera

580
00:30:51,904 --> 00:30:55,232
3910 mm of Focalin

581
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:59,840
Asteroids planetoids unknown planets meteors

582
00:31:00,096 --> 00:31:01,376
Planets Stars nebulas

583
00:31:01,888 --> 00:31:04,704
Constellations Orion

584
00:31:05,216 --> 00:31:06,240
Andromeda

585
00:31:06,752 --> 00:31:08,800
Taurus Virgo Perseus

586
00:31:09,056 --> 00:31:14,432
Wow you're very serious

587
00:31:16,224 --> 00:31:16,992
Siri serious

588
00:31:17,248 --> 00:31:22,112
Here's how I would

589
00:31:23,392 --> 00:31:24,416
Got it

590
00:31:26,976 --> 00:31:28,256
Videos of

591
00:31:28,768 --> 00:31:34,912
It's a nice-looking telescope telescope I mean it's fine it's better than

592
00:31:35,168 --> 00:31:36,704
Then like you're at your hobbyist

593
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:43,360
Do you have is a kid to look up at the stars

594
00:31:43,616 --> 00:31:49,248
Is it a comically oversized telescope like you might find in a cartoon

595
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:50,272
The 70s

596
00:31:50,528 --> 00:31:54,880
No it's right in the middle I will call it a middle-of-the-road but closer to

597
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:56,928
Impressive than

598
00:31:59,744 --> 00:32:01,024
No I don't know if he has

599
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:04,352
I don't know what he knows exactly what he's doing with it

600
00:32:06,912 --> 00:32:08,704
So okay so all we've got

601
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:09,984
Is a guy who has

602
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:10,752
The telescope

603
00:32:11,008 --> 00:32:12,032
That's not enough

604
00:32:12,288 --> 00:32:13,056
To get on

605
00:32:13,824 --> 00:32:14,336
Project Campbell

606
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:24,064
There is enough to get on Project Camelot

607
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:25,344
Drive

608
00:32:26,368 --> 00:32:27,392
He didn't

609
00:32:31,488 --> 00:32:35,840
That would actually be pretty cool thing I would actually listen to

610
00:32:36,096 --> 00:32:36,608
Interview

611
00:32:36,864 --> 00:32:37,376
Where she's like

612
00:32:37,632 --> 00:32:39,168
OK Google

613
00:32:39,424 --> 00:32:39,936
Telescope

614
00:32:40,704 --> 00:32:43,264
That would be interesting how things work

615
00:32:46,848 --> 00:32:48,128
Not project

616
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:49,664
But look to your right

617
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:50,432
You're right

618
00:32:50,944 --> 00:32:51,712
Imma call myself

619
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,272
Telescope is not enough

620
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:55,552
Michelle

621
00:32:55,808 --> 00:32:58,624
Guys got a lot of other things going on

622
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,672
She sees all through this telephone

623
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,744
You understand more than that

624
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:06,048
You going to break some

625
00:33:06,304 --> 00:33:08,864
Hoboken

626
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:11,168
So if you're able to bring the small photo

627
00:33:11,424 --> 00:33:13,216
Keep it the same way it is but just

628
00:33:13,728 --> 00:33:14,240
Bring it

629
00:33:14,496 --> 00:33:15,264
This wife

630
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:18,336
You describe hands

631
00:33:18,848 --> 00:33:19,872
Resuming enhance

632
00:33:20,128 --> 00:33:21,920
Very small

633
00:33:22,944 --> 00:33:28,576
Bending or the sorting and then you can see

634
00:33:28,832 --> 00:33:29,856
Some people think that

635
00:33:37,024 --> 00:33:40,096
Zoom

636
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:43,936
Are psychologists bigamy

637
00:33:44,704 --> 00:33:46,240
It's all real photography

638
00:33:47,264 --> 00:33:48,544
Very little filtering

639
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:58,272
Special objects

640
00:34:00,832 --> 00:34:02,112
What are giving me a good hand

641
00:34:02,368 --> 00:34:03,648
Honestly if

642
00:34:06,208 --> 00:34:08,512
I don't know I think I'm not getting out there

643
00:34:08,768 --> 00:34:12,352
So that people can see themselves you know what I have

644
00:34:13,376 --> 00:34:14,912
Beautiful what

645
00:34:15,168 --> 00:34:16,448
A whole bunch of movement

646
00:34:16,704 --> 00:34:19,776
Different UFOs

647
00:34:20,032 --> 00:34:23,360
I don't need to say they're all real if they are already

648
00:34:23,616 --> 00:34:26,176
That's really you know

649
00:34:26,432 --> 00:34:28,480
A lot of people don't realize that

650
00:34:28,736 --> 00:34:31,552
That's actually in my opinion

651
00:34:31,808 --> 00:34:32,320
Impressive

652
00:34:32,576 --> 00:34:36,928
Stop is when you actually have a crap flying and you're capturing that

653
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:39,232
Gaunt

654
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,304
I would say

655
00:34:43,328 --> 00:34:48,704
Watch some videos to show structures in motion on the moon

656
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:56,128
Like honestly a narration is crazy

657
00:34:56,640 --> 00:35:02,016
Is it good

658
00:35:02,272 --> 00:35:04,832
This is

659
00:35:06,112 --> 00:35:10,208
Wow that's not good over and over again with like

660
00:35:11,488 --> 00:35:12,000
Let's say

661
00:35:12,256 --> 00:35:14,560
You know it's like I've found proof of x y and z

662
00:35:14,816 --> 00:35:18,656
More like all those UFO guys has a picture and likewise

663
00:35:18,912 --> 00:35:20,704
Stream

664
00:35:23,264 --> 00:35:27,360
Cheating it in so much as like those people were creating fake UFOs

665
00:35:27,616 --> 00:35:28,128
And like Forest

666
00:35:28,384 --> 00:35:29,152
Perspective

667
00:35:29,408 --> 00:35:31,456
Things like that he's cheating

668
00:35:32,224 --> 00:35:38,112
Showing like a blurry pixel art on a picture that you've taken

669
00:35:39,136 --> 00:35:40,928
You're going to get the distortion

670
00:35:41,184 --> 00:35:42,976
And blurring of pixels

671
00:35:43,232 --> 00:35:46,560
Right there

672
00:35:46,816 --> 00:35:48,096
You could solve buddy

673
00:35:50,144 --> 00:35:52,448
Which is why you know

674
00:35:52,704 --> 00:35:57,568
Those really really big run by scientists yeah they don't they don't

675
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:58,592
No no

676
00:35:59,872 --> 00:36:04,224
Anybody who studies astronomy at all would be able to look at his stuff

677
00:36:05,504 --> 00:36:06,016
Like this is

678
00:36:07,552 --> 00:36:08,576
What you doing

679
00:36:08,832 --> 00:36:09,856
Misinterpreted

680
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:13,952
Studied

681
00:36:14,208 --> 00:36:15,232
Yeah but you can't have those

682
00:36:16,256 --> 00:36:18,816
Now I'm saying that anybody who has

683
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:20,352
Science

684
00:36:20,864 --> 00:36:22,400
Astronomy would understand

685
00:36:22,656 --> 00:36:23,424
And I said

686
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:24,192
Because

687
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:25,984
I must I must make clear

688
00:36:26,496 --> 00:36:27,264
This guy has not

689
00:36:28,032 --> 00:36:29,056
I don't

690
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:30,592
Backstory

691
00:36:31,616 --> 00:36:32,128
Is not

692
00:36:33,152 --> 00:36:34,176
Inspire confidence

693
00:36:37,504 --> 00:36:40,064
Driving now I've rebranded as Bruce sees all

694
00:36:40,576 --> 00:36:42,368
But not exactly

695
00:36:43,136 --> 00:36:44,416
Continue what I want to do is

696
00:36:44,672 --> 00:36:45,696
Forget you

697
00:36:45,952 --> 00:36:48,256
To talk about how you got into this deal

698
00:36:48,512 --> 00:36:51,840
Photography how you kind of got

699
00:36:52,096 --> 00:36:52,864
That'll happen

700
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,656
Well I was

701
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:09,504
What do I do

702
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:12,832
Photography

703
00:37:13,088 --> 00:37:16,928
Photos of people

704
00:37:17,184 --> 00:37:20,512
That I was getting really good at it

705
00:37:21,024 --> 00:37:23,072
I don't know it's weird

706
00:37:23,328 --> 00:37:29,472
They're notoriously hard to photograph

707
00:37:29,728 --> 00:37:31,776
Very weird

708
00:37:32,032 --> 00:37:33,312
Weird way to phrase

709
00:37:33,568 --> 00:37:35,616
It's almost like I am upset

710
00:37:35,872 --> 00:37:36,384
At my stomach

711
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:38,432
It's almost

712
00:37:40,992 --> 00:37:45,344
Because of course I have

713
00:37:45,856 --> 00:37:47,904
Station and I'm still working there

714
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,952
So it's a regular job

715
00:37:50,208 --> 00:37:51,232
Taking photos

716
00:37:51,744 --> 00:37:52,512
And then I

717
00:37:53,024 --> 00:37:55,840
1.2 make a long story short to jump into the

718
00:38:03,776 --> 00:38:05,568
Never sold any really

719
00:38:08,384 --> 00:38:10,176
And I got one star

720
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:13,248
I can say is that it was

721
00:38:13,504 --> 00:38:16,320
Towards the constellation of Draco

722
00:38:16,576 --> 00:38:18,368
Because you know people say where exactly is this

723
00:38:18,624 --> 00:38:21,952
Never given indication

724
00:38:22,208 --> 00:38:26,560
That's a bad sign

725
00:38:26,816 --> 00:38:28,864
You said it like

726
00:38:29,376 --> 00:38:30,144
You don't know where

727
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,168
Any stock

728
00:38:31,424 --> 00:38:34,752
If you're if you're taking pictures where you're purporting to show like

729
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:36,544
Life in space

730
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,080
Some structures and stuff like that

731
00:38:38,336 --> 00:38:39,872
It behooves you to be like

732
00:38:40,128 --> 00:38:40,896
Here's where it is

733
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:42,432
You guys go confirm for yourself

734
00:38:42,688 --> 00:38:43,456
It seems like

735
00:38:43,712 --> 00:38:45,248
Maybe the most important

736
00:38:46,016 --> 00:38:46,528
Also

737
00:38:46,784 --> 00:38:48,832
Also even in his back stories like

738
00:38:49,088 --> 00:38:55,232
Put things in angles to make it look

739
00:38:55,488 --> 00:38:58,560
Populate photographs

740
00:38:58,816 --> 00:39:04,960
Which is photography

741
00:39:06,752 --> 00:39:10,848
No usually bring up when you're describing your backstory

742
00:39:11,104 --> 00:39:15,456
Like reportedly supposed to reinforce that like I have hard evidence

743
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:20,320
Manipulating angles for art

744
00:39:20,832 --> 00:39:21,600
Benefit

745
00:39:21,856 --> 00:39:23,648
Blah blah blah

746
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:26,976
Some pictures of even a few kids

747
00:39:30,304 --> 00:39:32,352
Probably frankly I would not be

748
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:37,472
Leads me to believe that he does not have

749
00:39:38,752 --> 00:39:39,264
Astrophysics

750
00:39:43,616 --> 00:39:49,760
Instead of being I work at a bus station in as a hobby pictures

751
00:39:53,856 --> 00:39:54,624
Description of his life

752
00:39:55,136 --> 00:39:56,416
About

753
00:39:56,928 --> 00:39:58,976
Doing this I had a break

754
00:39:59,744 --> 00:40:00,512
What about

755
00:40:01,792 --> 00:40:07,680
No it didn't

756
00:40:07,936 --> 00:40:10,752
Plowed ground here from YouTube

757
00:40:12,544 --> 00:40:14,080
That's crazy levels of both

758
00:40:17,152 --> 00:40:18,688
Right there is enough to be like

759
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:19,712
No sir

760
00:40:20,224 --> 00:40:21,760
I will listen I will listen

761
00:40:22,016 --> 00:40:25,088
They know where the star

762
00:40:27,392 --> 00:40:30,208
I'm sure that it will be answered by the end of the episode by

763
00:40:30,464 --> 00:40:31,488
I want to

764
00:40:31,744 --> 00:40:32,256
To get this

765
00:40:32,768 --> 00:40:34,048
From you

766
00:40:35,328 --> 00:40:37,632
Does he believe what he's saying or is he

767
00:40:38,656 --> 00:40:41,472
Is he where is he on her stupid evil continue

768
00:40:41,728 --> 00:40:42,752
I would say both

769
00:40:43,008 --> 00:40:44,544
But probably closer to scamming

770
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:50,944
GoFundMe page

771
00:40:53,504 --> 00:40:56,320
So I don't know how lucrative

772
00:40:59,392 --> 00:41:00,160
The nascent stages

773
00:41:03,232 --> 00:41:06,048
I'd be hard-pressed to say that I don't think he also kind of believe

774
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:08,608
But it's easy to believe things when you don't

775
00:41:08,864 --> 00:41:09,376
Understand

776
00:41:09,888 --> 00:41:11,168
Like when you don't understand

777
00:41:11,424 --> 00:41:12,704
How space works

778
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:19,104
You don't understand what you're looking at its really easy to assume that blurring of pixels looks a lot like a building

779
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:20,128
It must be a builder

780
00:41:20,384 --> 00:41:22,688
Yeah when there's a really easy explanation

781
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:23,712
Just talked to anybody

782
00:41:26,016 --> 00:41:27,040
Astronomer be like

783
00:41:28,576 --> 00:41:31,904
Photography expert would be able to explain to you the blurring and

784
00:41:32,928 --> 00:41:38,048
Devore thing of pickles at happens when you zoom too far telescope manufacturer

785
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:41,376
Be able to

786
00:41:41,632 --> 00:41:43,168
Away pretty quick

787
00:41:43,424 --> 00:41:44,960
So

788
00:41:45,216 --> 00:41:46,496
Doesn't know where stars are

789
00:41:49,056 --> 00:41:50,080
It's a little bit worse

790
00:41:50,336 --> 00:41:51,360
In terms of the Assumption

791
00:41:52,895 --> 00:41:54,687
Because you know people say where exactly is a

792
00:41:54,943 --> 00:41:55,455
Star

793
00:41:55,711 --> 00:42:01,855
I never give an indication honestly I don't know

794
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:11,327
Or could be very far away and is you it was very small

795
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:16,191
Uh-oh uh-oh

796
00:42:20,287 --> 00:42:23,871
It could be two billion light years in the past

797
00:42:24,383 --> 00:42:25,151
I'll tell you who knows

798
00:42:25,407 --> 00:42:26,687
Astronomer

799
00:42:30,527 --> 00:42:32,319
It sounds like you.

800
00:42:33,343 --> 00:42:36,415
Probably them something

801
00:42:36,671 --> 00:42:37,439
Really no write-up

802
00:42:39,743 --> 00:42:45,887
Bruce sees all explain gravida cleansing

803
00:42:49,727 --> 00:42:51,775
It is president

804
00:42:52,543 --> 00:42:53,823
You know

805
00:42:54,079 --> 00:43:00,223
It's really boring to read a bunch of texts there's a f****** City up there

806
00:43:00,479 --> 00:43:03,295
Write me money

807
00:43:03,551 --> 00:43:06,367
Do that much more gratifying than today

808
00:43:06,623 --> 00:43:08,415
I don't know studying for 4 years

809
00:43:08,671 --> 00:43:10,719
To get a degree and it dedicated your life

810
00:43:10,975 --> 00:43:11,743
Working it out

811
00:43:11,999 --> 00:43:12,767
Like I'd large

812
00:43:13,023 --> 00:43:13,535
Telescope

813
00:43:18,911 --> 00:43:21,983
That's not the people have

814
00:43:22,239 --> 00:43:23,263
It's always fascinated

815
00:43:24,031 --> 00:43:25,823
These these people who are

816
00:43:26,847 --> 00:43:28,127
Essentially hard sci-fi

817
00:43:29,151 --> 00:43:35,295
Boulevard

818
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:36,831
Hard

819
00:43:37,087 --> 00:43:38,879
They struggle to avoid

820
00:43:39,135 --> 00:43:42,975
Learning anything about what it is they're talking about

821
00:43:46,303 --> 00:43:49,887
The strict adherence to rules

822
00:43:50,143 --> 00:43:50,655
Fanciful

823
00:43:50,911 --> 00:43:57,055
Neil deGrasse Tyson

824
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:00,895
The house wouldn't have flown like

825
00:44:01,151 --> 00:44:04,991
Close to the border of

826
00:44:05,247 --> 00:44:07,551
Do you like we won't talk about them on the show

827
00:44:08,063 --> 00:44:10,879
You know that that sort of Project Camelot line like

828
00:44:11,391 --> 00:44:12,415
Is this person

829
00:44:12,671 --> 00:44:13,183
Okay

830
00:44:13,439 --> 00:44:18,303
Haha very close to the line but he's on the right side of it

831
00:44:18,559 --> 00:44:19,071
Talk about

832
00:44:19,327 --> 00:44:23,679
I don't think that he's so mentally unwell

833
00:44:23,935 --> 00:44:25,215
And he's on the other side of it

834
00:44:25,727 --> 00:44:26,495
End of episode

835
00:44:26,751 --> 00:44:27,519
No no no no

836
00:44:31,103 --> 00:44:34,943
Star is because big

837
00:44:36,991 --> 00:44:38,271
Small and far

838
00:44:38,527 --> 00:44:39,551
Vice-versa whatever

839
00:44:39,807 --> 00:44:42,879
A really did a great job of explaining perspective

840
00:44:43,135 --> 00:44:45,183
Photographer would do

841
00:44:45,695 --> 00:44:47,231
So now hold on that clip isn't done

842
00:44:47,487 --> 00:44:47,999
It gets weirder

843
00:44:54,655 --> 00:45:00,031
Some surface structure

844
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:04,127
Very different to the Moon surface

845
00:45:08,479 --> 00:45:09,759
Was constructed

846
00:45:10,015 --> 00:45:11,295
It does look chiseled

847
00:45:12,831 --> 00:45:14,879
Ancient structures that we see here on

848
00:45:16,159 --> 00:45:22,047
The way they talk about the Egyptians

849
00:45:22,303 --> 00:45:24,351
Civilization

850
00:45:25,375 --> 00:45:25,887
On another

851
00:45:28,447 --> 00:45:31,519
Just chiseled out surface in certain areas

852
00:45:35,615 --> 00:45:36,127
There is

853
00:45:36,383 --> 00:45:37,919
Literally no way

854
00:45:38,687 --> 00:45:41,247
Good no matter what kind of Zoom is guys got

855
00:45:41,503 --> 00:45:44,575
You could find some looks chiseled out

856
00:45:46,111 --> 00:45:47,647
Like

857
00:45:49,183 --> 00:45:55,327
Jordans Jordans

858
00:45:56,351 --> 00:46:01,727
There was a service structure on a star

859
00:46:02,239 --> 00:46:08,383
Okay that's a lot of structure and determine

860
00:46:08,639 --> 00:46:09,919
The masonry of it

861
00:46:10,431 --> 00:46:13,247
From his telescope

862
00:46:13,503 --> 00:46:14,527
Is cockamamie bulshit

863
00:46:14,783 --> 00:46:18,367
Implore anyone to go watch any of his videos

864
00:46:18,623 --> 00:46:20,671
The idea that he could tell about the sort of

865
00:46:20,927 --> 00:46:23,743
Technique of the building is all in his imagination

866
00:46:24,255 --> 00:46:29,375
He's just making all that up

867
00:46:29,631 --> 00:46:33,727
Sanitary water

868
00:46:33,983 --> 00:46:34,495
Gotcha

869
00:46:35,519 --> 00:46:36,287
Two dudes

870
00:46:36,543 --> 00:46:37,567
Is this is wild stuff

871
00:46:37,823 --> 00:46:39,615
He also says that I got theirs

872
00:46:40,127 --> 00:46:41,919
Lush vegetation on the moon

873
00:46:42,175 --> 00:46:45,759
There's a lot of colors

874
00:46:46,271 --> 00:46:50,111
Alright understand is it like often times

875
00:46:51,135 --> 00:46:51,647
Space

876
00:46:51,903 --> 00:46:53,183
Of the Moon

877
00:46:53,695 --> 00:46:55,487
But if you take a picture of the moon

878
00:46:55,743 --> 00:46:56,767
From planet Earth

879
00:46:57,023 --> 00:46:59,327
Oftentimes you'll see a little bit of coloration

880
00:46:59,583 --> 00:47:01,119
Intuit you'll see there's like a little bit more

881
00:47:01,375 --> 00:47:02,911
Strict whiteness or even some

882
00:47:03,167 --> 00:47:03,679
Yellowing

883
00:47:03,935 --> 00:47:08,031
That sort of phenomenon and the reason for that is Earth's atmosphere

884
00:47:13,663 --> 00:47:14,943
A picture

885
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:16,735
Through Earth's atmosphere

886
00:47:17,503 --> 00:47:22,623
Looks different than taking picture from like the Hubble telescope which is outside of a bingo baby

887
00:47:22,879 --> 00:47:24,927
I don't understand how that could affect

888
00:47:26,719 --> 00:47:30,303
What if it's just really really close in Earth's atmosphere

889
00:47:31,327 --> 00:47:37,471
He's also said that he likes to take things

890
00:47:37,727 --> 00:47:43,103
You just did that new forgot that's why you think there's vegetation

891
00:47:45,663 --> 00:47:46,687
There is are

892
00:47:47,199 --> 00:47:49,247
Alright

893
00:47:49,503 --> 00:47:50,015
Not enough

894
00:47:50,527 --> 00:47:54,623
I mean that not enough for you

895
00:47:54,879 --> 00:47:55,903
Lush vegetation

896
00:47:56,671 --> 00:47:58,207
Whatever his

897
00:48:00,255 --> 00:48:02,047
Now I want to say that I don't think

898
00:48:02,303 --> 00:48:04,351
G Spot astronomy is strong

899
00:48:04,607 --> 00:48:05,887
Not great I would save

900
00:48:06,143 --> 00:48:06,911
The indication

901
00:48:07,935 --> 00:48:10,239
I don't know how far away this thing is it could be

902
00:48:10,495 --> 00:48:11,775
Fart

903
00:48:12,031 --> 00:48:12,799
Small enclosed

904
00:48:13,055 --> 00:48:16,127
That leads me to believe that he's not wrestled with the actual work

905
00:48:16,639 --> 00:48:18,175
But this next quickly

906
00:48:18,431 --> 00:48:18,943
Believe

907
00:48:19,199 --> 00:48:20,223
That this guy

908
00:48:21,503 --> 00:48:23,807
He is into cutting Corners when it comes to physics

909
00:48:24,575 --> 00:48:27,647
Can you ask do you have any idea how big

910
00:48:27,903 --> 00:48:30,463
Example

911
00:48:30,719 --> 00:48:33,023
Dimensions of the dimensions of the crop

912
00:48:33,279 --> 00:48:38,143
And then the structures can you even is there even any way to estimate

913
00:48:45,823 --> 00:48:48,127
Maybe seem silly but it seems to me the most

914
00:48:49,663 --> 00:48:50,687
Logical weight

915
00:48:50,943 --> 00:48:53,503
Confirm something using the eye

916
00:48:55,295 --> 00:48:57,343
Compared to the size of the creators

917
00:49:02,463 --> 00:49:03,743
I'll take a very small

918
00:49:03,999 --> 00:49:04,511
Equator

919
00:49:05,023 --> 00:49:07,839
Any frames that I will find the small UFO

920
00:49:12,703 --> 00:49:13,215
So

921
00:49:15,263 --> 00:49:18,079
45

922
00:49:34,207 --> 00:49:34,719
Phuket

923
00:49:34,975 --> 00:49:35,487
Scuse me sir

924
00:49:38,303 --> 00:49:43,423
Well he isn't Canada I believe so you might be on the kilometer

925
00:49:45,471 --> 00:49:45,983
Conversion

926
00:49:46,239 --> 00:49:48,287
Help carry out

927
00:49:48,543 --> 00:49:51,103
Now the first problem that I would say

928
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:52,383
With this

929
00:49:52,639 --> 00:49:54,687
Technique of judging with craters

930
00:49:55,199 --> 00:49:57,759
Is the exact same thing she's already brought up

931
00:49:58,271 --> 00:50:01,855
What if that's far away from the crater

932
00:50:02,111 --> 00:50:08,255
How are you touching the sizes of the crater that I decide to the pixel dammit

933
00:50:08,767 --> 00:50:11,583
It makes perfect sense

934
00:50:16,191 --> 00:50:20,031
Doesn't work

935
00:50:20,287 --> 00:50:22,847
To use like to know how big one of these craters

936
00:50:23,359 --> 00:50:23,871
First of all

937
00:50:25,151 --> 00:50:27,967
That's the problem

938
00:50:28,223 --> 00:50:28,735
The vet

939
00:50:28,991 --> 00:50:30,015
I just I think you just like this

940
00:50:30,271 --> 00:50:31,807
The f****** 3-mile spaceship

941
00:50:32,063 --> 00:50:32,575
Buddy

942
00:50:32,831 --> 00:50:33,343
Joy

943
00:50:34,111 --> 00:50:34,623
School

944
00:50:35,391 --> 00:50:35,903
I mean

945
00:50:36,159 --> 00:50:38,719
Tragically

946
00:50:38,975 --> 00:50:41,791
Flawed thinking

947
00:50:42,047 --> 00:50:44,863
Google how large

948
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:51,263
Craters on the moon are and people have courses you can

949
00:50:51,775 --> 00:50:56,127
See if that was the crater that you were looking at now here here's where things get real bad

950
00:50:56,383 --> 00:50:56,895
For Bruce

951
00:50:57,151 --> 00:50:57,663
Is the

952
00:50:58,175 --> 00:50:59,455
If he did do that

953
00:50:59,711 --> 00:51:00,479
Take those measure

954
00:51:02,015 --> 00:51:03,039
And we

955
00:51:03,295 --> 00:51:05,087
Just for fun

956
00:51:05,343 --> 00:51:07,647
Spaceships on tape

957
00:51:09,695 --> 00:51:10,719
And he does take that

958
00:51:10,975 --> 00:51:13,279
You know whatever measurement is made of the spaceship

959
00:51:13,535 --> 00:51:14,303
Can put it into the

960
00:51:15,583 --> 00:51:17,375
The crater that he have the measurement of

961
00:51:17,887 --> 00:51:20,191
The prospective problem is still a problem

962
00:51:20,447 --> 00:51:23,263
Confirm where that spaceship was

963
00:51:23,519 --> 00:51:24,543
Unless

964
00:51:24,799 --> 00:51:25,823
On the ground

965
00:51:26,335 --> 00:51:29,407
In what is much as it is buggy

966
00:51:29,663 --> 00:51:30,431
You can't do this

967
00:51:31,199 --> 00:51:34,783
But you can't do that cuz even if it's a mile off the grappler

968
00:51:35,039 --> 00:51:38,367
It's going to completely fuk up your measurements your equations are bunk

969
00:51:38,623 --> 00:51:39,391
Literally

970
00:51:39,647 --> 00:51:40,159
Could be

971
00:51:40,415 --> 00:51:42,207
In the exact middle

972
00:51:42,719 --> 00:51:48,863
Distance between where the Earth is in and it would look to you taking a

973
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:50,655
Picture as it might have been asked

974
00:51:52,703 --> 00:51:53,471
3 miles

975
00:51:53,727 --> 00:51:54,495
According to that

976
00:51:54,751 --> 00:51:58,591
Because it's halfway between the Earth and the only I don't know

977
00:51:59,103 --> 00:52:01,407
60 ft Black it's a pleasure yacht

978
00:52:01,663 --> 00:52:07,807
Horoscope

979
00:52:08,063 --> 00:52:12,415
Spacecraft

980
00:52:15,487 --> 00:52:17,791
I mean look I watch these videos

981
00:52:18,047 --> 00:52:21,631
Get into why others

982
00:52:23,167 --> 00:52:23,679
But

983
00:52:24,191 --> 00:52:25,471
What's more important is

984
00:52:25,727 --> 00:52:27,775
Just thinking that we're seeing demonstrate at

985
00:52:28,031 --> 00:52:29,055
The lack of him even

986
00:52:29,311 --> 00:52:30,335
Like realizing

987
00:52:31,359 --> 00:52:33,151
Huh that could be a problem

988
00:52:33,407 --> 00:52:34,687
For my equation

989
00:52:34,943 --> 00:52:35,455
Play ideas

990
00:52:35,967 --> 00:52:36,479
The

991
00:52:36,735 --> 00:52:38,783
Supposed UFO isn't on the ground

992
00:52:39,551 --> 00:52:42,367
Am I going to get around that he's just like

993
00:52:42,623 --> 00:52:43,647
Oh no

994
00:52:43,903 --> 00:52:45,951
Structure on the

995
00:52:46,207 --> 00:52:48,511
Assume everything is grounded

996
00:52:48,767 --> 00:52:50,303
I'm sure that makes sense yeah

997
00:52:51,583 --> 00:52:57,727
No one knows where that might have been us.

998
00:52:57,983 --> 00:52:58,751
Where

999
00:53:00,287 --> 00:53:02,079
The stars are everywhere always

1000
00:53:05,151 --> 00:53:06,175
I will never

1001
00:53:06,687 --> 00:53:07,711
Maybe I do

1002
00:53:07,967 --> 00:53:09,247
I don't understand that

1003
00:53:10,527 --> 00:53:11,551
Reaction

1004
00:53:11,807 --> 00:53:12,575
So many people have

1005
00:53:13,855 --> 00:53:14,879
Anybody who spent

1006
00:53:15,135 --> 00:53:15,903
Entire life

1007
00:53:16,671 --> 00:53:17,439
Studying stuff

1008
00:53:18,207 --> 00:53:18,719
Like just

1009
00:53:18,975 --> 00:53:20,767
La Quinta Inn

1010
00:53:21,023 --> 00:53:24,095
Like there are people who started out as like

1011
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:25,887
90 rolls

1012
00:53:26,399 --> 00:53:32,031
Literally fascinated by all the stuff they go through school they're their brilliant than they go to college

1013
00:53:32,287 --> 00:53:33,567
They tell you all of this stuff

1014
00:53:33,823 --> 00:53:37,407
They're brilliant and then they spend the next 20 to 30 years of their life

1015
00:53:37,663 --> 00:53:42,527
Building these vaccines in order to save lives and there are a bunch of people are just like

1016
00:53:42,783 --> 00:53:45,343
F*** you you don't know a goddamn thing

1017
00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:46,879
Like what are you

1018
00:53:47,903 --> 00:53:50,463
They're doing it for

1019
00:53:52,511 --> 00:53:55,327
It's a really boring thing to do like the human in

1020
00:53:55,583 --> 00:53:56,863
That you have to like

1021
00:53:57,119 --> 00:53:59,423
Want to make your mark on ship

1022
00:53:59,679 --> 00:54:02,751
Is not going to be satisfied by Ray

1023
00:54:03,007 --> 00:54:06,591
They're trying to do

1024
00:54:06,847 --> 00:54:09,151
Parallel between the worlds of Alex

1025
00:54:09,407 --> 00:54:12,223
The project

1026
00:54:12,479 --> 00:54:12,991
Black people

1027
00:54:13,503 --> 00:54:17,087
It is very similar thinking that these people have with

1028
00:54:17,855 --> 00:54:18,367
Inasmuch

1029
00:54:19,391 --> 00:54:20,927
They don't look at it that way

1030
00:54:21,183 --> 00:54:23,487
They don't look at it as someone has dedicated their life

1031
00:54:23,743 --> 00:54:25,791
Studying this stuff and they know more than me

1032
00:54:26,303 --> 00:54:26,815
Just because I

1033
00:54:27,839 --> 00:54:29,631
Angry and Watson

1034
00:54:30,143 --> 00:54:32,447
You know scam people out of there

1035
00:54:32,703 --> 00:54:34,751
They don't look at it that way they look at it like

1036
00:54:35,007 --> 00:54:37,567
These people got it with probably good intent

1037
00:54:38,847 --> 00:54:41,151
Team sucked into the nefarious globalist

1038
00:54:41,663 --> 00:54:44,991
So like with the vaccine it's like

1039
00:54:45,247 --> 00:54:49,343
Corrupted by big Pharma and you know that took over

1040
00:54:49,599 --> 00:54:54,975
You know what they were about

1041
00:54:55,231 --> 00:54:55,743
All shity

1042
00:54:56,511 --> 00:54:59,839
And NASA is doing the big cover-up and now they're apart

1043
00:55:02,655 --> 00:55:03,679
Track if you ever

1044
00:55:05,471 --> 00:55:06,239
Any kind

1045
00:55:06,495 --> 00:55:07,007
Make

1046
00:55:07,263 --> 00:55:07,775
Send snow

1047
00:55:08,287 --> 00:55:09,823
No put it it does make sense

1048
00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:11,359
If you're looking for a convenient

1049
00:55:11,615 --> 00:55:13,151
Easy way to explain

1050
00:55:13,663 --> 00:55:15,199
The not explaining

1051
00:55:18,527 --> 00:55:21,599
Why is everyone disagreeing with

1052
00:55:22,111 --> 00:55:22,879
Yeah

1053
00:55:23,135 --> 00:55:23,903
You know

1054
00:55:24,927 --> 00:55:25,439
You can't

1055
00:55:26,719 --> 00:55:27,231
Cannot

1056
00:55:28,511 --> 00:55:29,791
Certain level of trust

1057
00:55:30,047 --> 00:55:30,815
Just another human being

1058
00:55:31,327 --> 00:55:36,703
Unless unless those people implicitly agree with whatever world

1059
00:55:36,959 --> 00:55:39,775
Internet why Carrie gets sucked in by people like

1060
00:55:40,031 --> 00:55:42,335
I-80

1061
00:55:42,591 --> 00:55:44,383
Because he reinforces

1062
00:55:44,639 --> 00:55:45,919
The worldview that she's already

1063
00:55:46,175 --> 00:55:49,503
By guest all the time

1064
00:55:49,759 --> 00:55:51,039
Robert David Steele on

1065
00:55:51,551 --> 00:55:52,575
He was reinforcing Alex

1066
00:55:52,831 --> 00:55:55,647
His worldview until he came on and said that their children

1067
00:55:57,439 --> 00:55:59,999
And that's when Alex Bruce has

1068
00:56:00,767 --> 00:56:02,047
Photograph some of those

1069
00:56:04,351 --> 00:56:05,119
But even that

1070
00:56:08,447 --> 00:56:09,215
Person that they can

1071
00:56:09,471 --> 00:56:10,495
Can ever truly trust

1072
00:56:11,007 --> 00:56:11,519
Is themself

1073
00:56:12,031 --> 00:56:16,639
The only people that believe you are extension

1074
00:56:17,919 --> 00:56:22,015
That's such a bummer man engaged with the rest of the human race

1075
00:56:23,039 --> 00:56:29,183
But

1076
00:56:30,975 --> 00:56:37,119
This guy was putting the stuff out into the world video

1077
00:56:37,631 --> 00:56:40,959
I believe that these are structures

1078
00:56:41,215 --> 00:56:44,031
I could be wrong and you know I just want to put this out there

1079
00:56:44,287 --> 00:56:45,055
Start a conversation

1080
00:56:46,591 --> 00:56:47,615
I wouldn't laugh at him

1081
00:56:48,127 --> 00:56:51,967
No I wouldn't treat him like a dick I would be open to the

1082
00:56:52,223 --> 00:56:54,015
The possibilities that

1083
00:56:54,271 --> 00:56:55,295
What you're seeing isn't

1084
00:56:55,551 --> 00:56:56,319
What you think it is

1085
00:56:56,831 --> 00:56:57,343
Victor

1086
00:56:57,599 --> 00:56:58,623
Booty is what makes

1087
00:56:58,879 --> 00:57:01,439
It's funny because the certainty implies

1088
00:57:01,951 --> 00:57:02,463
You're trying to pull

1089
00:57:02,719 --> 00:57:07,839
You and I can only experience.

1090
00:57:09,119 --> 00:57:11,167
You know what I mean like you and I are both

1091
00:57:14,495 --> 00:57:19,359
I don't agree with you

1092
00:57:20,639 --> 00:57:21,151
So many of these

1093
00:57:21,663 --> 00:57:23,199
Well is that you and I are

1094
00:57:24,479 --> 00:57:25,247
Default

1095
00:57:25,503 --> 00:57:26,783
At the death position

1096
00:57:27,295 --> 00:57:29,343
Like is like

1097
00:57:29,599 --> 00:57:31,903
There's no way that my first reaction

1098
00:57:32,159 --> 00:57:33,183
Or even

1099
00:57:33,439 --> 00:57:34,463
Action is the correct

1100
00:57:34,719 --> 00:57:35,487
Bro I need to

1101
00:57:35,743 --> 00:57:37,279
To make sure and double check

1102
00:57:39,071 --> 00:57:43,423
Chinese people don't have that at all that's why this guy I'll maybe make 8500

1103
00:57:43,679 --> 00:57:45,215
Hundred dollars into GoFundMe but

1104
00:57:45,471 --> 00:57:46,495
No one will know who he is

1105
00:57:49,567 --> 00:57:50,079
His wife

1106
00:57:51,871 --> 00:57:52,895
Still working at that bus

1107
00:57:53,919 --> 00:57:54,431
Ouch

1108
00:57:54,687 --> 00:57:55,711
Taking pictures of the moon

1109
00:57:56,479 --> 00:57:57,759
And children

1110
00:58:02,367 --> 00:58:03,647
I can't get that out of my head

1111
00:58:03,903 --> 00:58:09,791
Because this next clip scares me a little bit

1112
00:58:10,047 --> 00:58:11,583
I'm trying to figure out

1113
00:58:12,095 --> 00:58:14,143
How much harassment do you get

1114
00:58:14,399 --> 00:58:19,519
You know in terms of what you're doing are you doing today

1115
00:58:24,383 --> 00:58:27,711
Harassment

1116
00:58:31,039 --> 00:58:32,063
What real quick you said

1117
00:58:32,575 --> 00:58:33,343
II

1118
00:58:33,599 --> 00:58:34,879
I need to start that back a little

1119
00:58:35,391 --> 00:58:36,927
Because I listen to

1120
00:58:37,439 --> 00:58:39,487
Quite figure

1121
00:58:39,743 --> 00:58:41,279
Spider-Man and Black

1122
00:58:41,535 --> 00:58:42,303
Or if you saying

1123
00:58:42,815 --> 00:58:44,863
The idea that I've been harassed by the Men in Black isn't

1124
00:58:45,119 --> 00:58:46,143
Tru Hotel

1125
00:58:46,399 --> 00:58:52,543
HD has been harassed

1126
00:58:52,799 --> 00:58:56,639
Men In Black Vincent D'Onofrio is a little bit upsetting

1127
00:58:57,151 --> 00:58:57,919
Vincent D'Onofrio

1128
00:58:58,175 --> 00:58:58,687
With the heroes

1129
00:58:58,943 --> 00:59:02,527
Listen I want to I want you to track this is Chloe please okay

1130
00:59:02,783 --> 00:59:04,063
I'm not sure

1131
00:59:04,575 --> 00:59:05,087
What is Elijah

1132
00:59:05,343 --> 00:59:07,135
What you're doing are you

1133
00:59:21,983 --> 00:59:24,543
Could tell you that I've been raised by the Men in Black but it's not true

1134
00:59:25,311 --> 00:59:27,615
Credit

1135
00:59:27,871 --> 00:59:28,639
That's that's what he said

1136
00:59:29,663 --> 00:59:34,527
Threw me the first time of her death

1137
00:59:34,783 --> 00:59:37,599
I could tell you that I've been harassed by the Men in Black

1138
00:59:37,855 --> 00:59:41,951
Very honest, I could tell you

1139
00:59:42,207 --> 00:59:44,511
The phrasing is a little bit,

1140
00:59:44,767 --> 00:59:45,279
Located

1141
00:59:45,535 --> 00:59:47,071
Especially for a Project Camelot gas

1142
00:59:47,327 --> 00:59:50,911
Yeah I'm okay with

1143
00:59:51,167 --> 00:59:53,215
Black

1144
00:59:54,495 --> 00:59:57,055
Control tell you that I'm upset

1145
00:59:57,311 --> 00:59:59,359
My stomach but my stomach is

1146
01:00:00,127 --> 01:00:00,639
Right

1147
01:00:02,687 --> 01:00:03,967
France but honestly

1148
01:00:04,223 --> 01:00:05,759
Seems really

1149
01:00:06,015 --> 01:00:09,599
More nasty and vindictive and try to scare me and

1150
01:00:15,999 --> 01:00:18,303
Do something worse than you and I'll play with them

1151
01:00:19,327 --> 01:00:20,863
To see how they react

1152
01:00:21,119 --> 01:00:21,887
Because honestly

1153
01:00:22,143 --> 01:00:24,191
People that are doing this for real

1154
01:00:24,447 --> 01:00:25,727
I've seen some story

1155
01:00:27,007 --> 01:00:28,031
They say 6 words

1156
01:00:33,407 --> 01:00:33,919
Tubalcain

1157
01:00:34,431 --> 01:00:35,455
I don't know what those two

1158
01:00:37,247 --> 01:00:38,271
Maybe I'm going to

1159
01:00:38,527 --> 01:00:39,551
To kill you I am

1160
01:00:42,879 --> 01:00:47,743
Right very weird

1161
01:00:48,511 --> 01:00:52,607
I don't know what you're talkin about freaked me the f*** out

1162
01:00:56,447 --> 01:01:01,567
What's one of these what's the acrostics for the solar system

1163
01:01:02,079 --> 01:01:05,407
You know like my very I don't want to say mine

1164
01:01:07,199 --> 01:01:10,015
Yeah it was my very erotic

1165
01:01:11,295 --> 01:01:13,087
Reminder nasty pillows

1166
01:01:13,343 --> 01:01:15,647
Now that's why they're crossed

1167
01:01:16,159 --> 01:01:17,439
I don't think so

1168
01:01:17,695 --> 01:01:18,463
I believe it is

1169
01:01:19,743 --> 01:01:20,767
Because you can put them

1170
01:01:23,839 --> 01:01:24,607
The reason that they

1171
01:01:24,863 --> 01:01:26,143
No to tell you only

1172
01:01:27,423 --> 01:01:29,215
Is because there are really

1173
01:01:30,495 --> 01:01:33,311
Write 6 words

1174
01:01:33,567 --> 01:01:35,615
Dude it's like D12

1175
01:01:36,127 --> 01:01:39,967
There's only six 12 there's six members

1176
01:01:40,991 --> 01:01:41,759
Dirigo

1177
01:01:42,015 --> 01:01:48,159
There's twelve planets including

1178
01:01:54,815 --> 01:01:56,095
He doesn't Alter Ego planet

1179
01:01:56,607 --> 01:01:57,631
So Jordan

1180
01:01:57,887 --> 01:01:59,423
I don't like the idea that he saying

1181
01:01:59,679 --> 01:02:00,959
People threaten

1182
01:02:01,983 --> 01:02:02,495
Because

1183
01:02:02,751 --> 01:02:03,263
No

1184
01:02:03,775 --> 01:02:04,543
From looking at these

1185
01:02:05,055 --> 01:02:05,823
Finality type

1186
01:02:06,335 --> 01:02:11,967
Ovarian pain feel like they're being threatened when they're not

1187
01:02:12,223 --> 01:02:13,759
Running me respond to

1188
01:02:14,015 --> 01:02:14,527
Critique

1189
01:02:14,783 --> 01:02:15,551
As threats

1190
01:02:16,063 --> 01:02:17,599
Which is why I would like to bring everyone

1191
01:02:18,111 --> 01:02:20,415
Listen to website called flat-earth lunacy.

1192
01:02:21,183 --> 01:02:22,207
To the website that

1193
01:02:22,463 --> 01:02:23,999
Takes people to make flat Earth arguments and

1194
01:02:24,255 --> 01:02:24,767
Brake sound like

1195
01:02:25,535 --> 01:02:28,863
Bulshit is a lot of other astronomy related

1196
01:02:29,375 --> 01:02:30,143
Stuff on there

1197
01:02:30,399 --> 01:02:33,471
And they did a little bit of looking into Bruce sees all

1198
01:02:33,727 --> 01:02:35,263
Right

1199
01:02:35,519 --> 01:02:37,567
Very critical

1200
01:02:39,615 --> 01:02:41,151
Really believe that Bruce

1201
01:02:41,407 --> 01:02:42,175
Diesel

1202
01:02:42,431 --> 01:02:43,199
Could be a name

1203
01:02:43,967 --> 01:02:47,807
It's like I really haven't really have a hard time pulling with

1204
01:02:48,319 --> 01:02:48,831
Bruce

1205
01:02:52,671 --> 01:02:54,463
Lego

1206
01:02:54,719 --> 01:02:57,791
It's not though

1207
01:02:59,839 --> 01:03:01,119
You got wind of

1208
01:03:01,375 --> 01:03:01,887

You guys want to be the top and it ain't about me

1217
01:03:25,951 --> 01:03:27,231
It's about exposing what is true

1218
01:03:27,743 --> 01:03:30,303
You're part of the light open

1219
01:03:30,559 --> 01:03:31,583

For your family it appears

1234
01:04:04,863 --> 01:04:05,887
These posts against me

1235
01:04:06,143 --> 01:04:10,495
Community that I have stirred up a few brainless wonders to the reality of it all

1236
01:04:10,751 --> 01:04:13,311
The fact that everything you said about me was a lie

1237
01:04:13,567 --> 01:04:15,615
Therefore this post will be taken down

1238
01:04:15,871 --> 01:04:17,919
My business will not be attacked by you

1239
01:04:18,175 --> 01:04:20,479
You will have brought many troubles your way

1240
01:04:21,759 --> 01:04:23,551
I will be watching what you

01:04:25,855 --> 01:04:29,183

01:04:32,255 --> 01:04:32,767
Alright

1244
01:04:33,023 --> 01:04:34,047
I'm sure it was supposed to be

1245
01:04:34,559 --> 01:04:37,887
Better hear from Mike buddy

1246
01:04:38,143 --> 01:04:39,679
Mike ain't so friendly

1247
01:04:44,031 --> 01:04:50,175
Tell me a co-worker the bus station

1248
01:04:54,527 --> 01:04:58,879
Yeah I didn't realize he was running that kind of operation

1249
01:04:59,135 --> 01:05:01,183
The kind of response that he gives out with someone

1250
01:05:01,439 --> 01:05:05,023
Critique the possibility that he's not doing due diligence

1251
01:05:05,279 --> 01:05:06,559
Astronomy assumptions

1252
01:05:09,887 --> 01:05:10,655
Disguises

1253
01:05:10,911 --> 01:05:11,935
Skype little bit aggressive

1254
01:05:12,191 --> 01:05:13,471
Little Acro

1255
01:05:13,727 --> 01:05:15,007
Question the intelligence

1256
01:05:16,031 --> 01:05:16,799
People debunk

1257
01:05:17,055 --> 01:05:17,567
Kingdom muzic

1258
01:05:18,591 --> 01:05:19,359
Austin route

1259
01:05:19,615 --> 01:05:20,127
Veal

1260
01:05:20,383 --> 01:05:21,407
Via their question

1261
01:05:21,919 --> 01:05:23,967
They are not themselves

1262
01:05:24,223 --> 01:05:26,271
Don't have a good grasp

1263
01:05:26,527 --> 01:05:28,063
You guys think you're so smart

1264
01:05:28,319 --> 01:05:28,831
And

1265
01:05:29,087 --> 01:05:30,623
You misspelled everything anthro brackets

1266
01:05:31,391 --> 01:05:32,415
In the wrong place is like

1267
01:05:32,927 --> 01:05:33,439
Guide

1268
01:05:33,695 --> 01:05:34,463
It's like hey

1269
01:05:34,719 --> 01:05:36,255
I get it that you're angry

1270
01:05:37,023 --> 01:05:37,535
But come on

1271
01:05:38,303 --> 01:05:44,447
Doolittle double-check spell check your writing an email you got time it's not like you're on the phone but you know what to do

1272
01:05:44,703 --> 01:05:46,495
Be it also is an indication of lack of

1273
01:05:46,751 --> 01:05:47,263
Trust

1274
01:05:47,519 --> 01:05:48,543
And your own

1275
01:05:49,311 --> 01:05:52,383
Like that that sort of behaviour to me really indicates the

1276
01:05:53,663 --> 01:05:56,223
Bruce himself knows what he's putting out at

1277
01:05:56,735 --> 01:05:58,271
Yeah you know when silkies just like

1278
01:06:00,063 --> 01:06:00,575
Better attack

1279
01:06:01,599 --> 01:06:05,439
Otherwise I'm not going to be able to stand up my marriage

1280
01:06:05,695 --> 01:06:06,719
We just a weird distorted

1281
01:06:09,535 --> 01:06:10,047
The city

1282
01:06:10,303 --> 01:06:13,119
I don't I am worried about this guy and I hope

1283
01:06:13,375 --> 01:06:14,143
Attacks us

1284
01:06:15,423 --> 01:06:15,935
Weird

1285
01:06:16,959 --> 01:06:21,311
What is the difference between that guy and like

1286
01:06:21,567 --> 01:06:22,591
The Daily Caller

1287
01:06:23,359 --> 01:06:24,383
It's just proofreading

1288
01:06:24,639 --> 01:06:30,783
Yeah like Daily Caller has all of the same insults towards disagree with that but they

1289
01:06:31,295 --> 01:06:34,623
Just proofread for some reason a huge section of the population

1290
01:06:35,391 --> 01:06:38,463
Don't know if this guy is really into white

1291
01:06:38,719 --> 01:06:39,231
Or anything

1292
01:06:39,487 --> 01:06:40,255
I don't really proud

1293
01:06:40,511 --> 01:06:41,535
I don't really know his business

1294
01:06:44,095 --> 01:06:46,911
Maybe we'll find a way

1295
01:06:49,215 --> 01:06:55,359
We will find a way

1296
01:06:56,639 --> 01:06:57,919
Next clip

1297
01:06:58,175 --> 01:06:59,199
Carrie

1298
01:06:59,455 --> 01:07:00,479
Has a very hard question

1299
01:07:00,991 --> 01:07:01,503
Bruce

1300
01:07:01,759 --> 01:07:02,783
And that is

1301
01:07:05,855 --> 01:07:09,695
First of all I want to understand weather

1302
01:07:10,719 --> 01:07:11,743
You stink

1303
01:07:11,999 --> 01:07:14,303
That you have ever photograph being

1304
01:07:16,607 --> 01:07:18,399
Interesting question

1305
01:07:21,727 --> 01:07:23,263
Possibility

1306
01:07:23,519 --> 01:07:26,847
I don't think people understand what I mean by being

1307
01:07:27,615 --> 01:07:29,663
I'm not seem right now

1308
01:07:29,919 --> 01:07:30,687
Anything with

1309
01:07:31,199 --> 01:07:33,247
Play shoulders and legs

1310
01:07:33,759 --> 01:07:35,551
I'm seeing things right

1311
01:07:38,879 --> 01:07:42,463
Or that not debris

1312
01:07:42,975 --> 01:07:48,351
It looks like they're moving themselves

1313
01:07:48,607 --> 01:07:50,143
Use photographic

1314
01:07:50,399 --> 01:07:52,447
The glow cloud

1315
01:07:52,703 --> 01:07:58,335
Photograph

1316
01:08:00,127 --> 01:08:02,175
There is not

1317
01:08:05,247 --> 01:08:05,759
But

1318
01:08:07,295 --> 01:08:07,807
Halo

1319
01:08:08,063 --> 01:08:10,367
Phenomenon of

1320
01:08:11,391 --> 01:08:12,671
End up being

1321
01:08:12,927 --> 01:08:16,767
Caught in space like we talked about with the coloration of things

1322
01:08:17,279 --> 01:08:19,071
Space often being affected by

1323
01:08:20,095 --> 01:08:21,631
You know just the earth atmosphere

1324
01:08:22,143 --> 01:08:23,423
1

1325
01:08:23,679 --> 01:08:24,191
Consideration

1326
01:08:24,447 --> 01:08:24,959
Cuz even if you're using

1327
01:08:25,215 --> 01:08:25,727
Telescope

1328
01:08:26,495 --> 01:08:27,007
Clouds

1329
01:08:27,263 --> 01:08:29,055
You know you can't see through

1330
01:08:38,015 --> 01:08:38,783
Footage of something

1331
01:08:39,039 --> 01:08:42,367
Appears to have clouds on the moon

1332
01:08:42,879 --> 01:08:43,903
Very high

1333
01:08:44,159 --> 01:08:45,183
Spirit

1334
01:08:45,439 --> 01:08:49,279
Cloud-like up really high in the troposphere or whatever

1335
01:08:49,535 --> 01:08:51,327
I don't remember the exact

1336
01:08:56,447 --> 01:08:59,007
Heaven I don't really remember the

1337
01:09:00,031 --> 01:09:02,335
BMX

1338
01:09:02,847 --> 01:09:05,151
Why is ended up taking pictures of

1339
01:09:06,431 --> 01:09:06,943
You know

1340
01:09:07,711 --> 01:09:08,223
Clouds

1341
01:09:08,479 --> 01:09:09,759
Alive

1342
01:09:10,271 --> 01:09:11,039
That leads me to

1343
01:09:11,295 --> 01:09:11,807
To believe that

1344
01:09:12,319 --> 01:09:12,831
PDF picture

1345
01:09:14,623 --> 01:09:15,647
Accidentally captured

1346
01:09:15,903 --> 01:09:17,183
Something like

1347
01:09:17,695 --> 01:09:18,975
High-level Cirrus

1348
01:09:19,231 --> 01:09:20,255
Cloud

1349
01:09:22,559 --> 01:09:23,839
EZ's captured that

1350
01:09:24,351 --> 01:09:25,631
And is misunderstanding

1351
01:09:28,191 --> 01:09:31,519
That's kind of what I'm guessing he made the classic rookie

1352
01:09:31,775 --> 01:09:33,055
Mistake of a guy with a telescope

1353
01:09:33,823 --> 01:09:34,335
You can only see

1354
01:09:34,591 --> 01:09:35,103
The space

1355
01:09:35,359 --> 01:09:35,871
You can only speak

1356
01:09:36,383 --> 01:09:36,895
She's facing when it's

1357
01:09:37,407 --> 01:09:37,919
Right

1358
01:09:38,687 --> 01:09:40,479
Descendants

1359
01:09:40,735 --> 01:09:41,759
If you watch his videos

1360
01:09:42,527 --> 01:09:44,063
To be light

1361
01:09:44,575 --> 01:09:45,087
Stuff like that

1362
01:09:45,343 --> 01:09:46,623
8

1363
01:09:47,647 --> 01:09:48,927
NoHo

1364
01:09:49,183 --> 01:09:50,719
Lake reflection

1365
01:09:51,231 --> 01:09:52,767
No it's not it's not

1366
01:09:53,023 --> 01:09:55,839
You're not actually seeing like a luminescent bulb

1367
01:09:56,095 --> 01:09:56,607
On the moon

1368
01:09:59,423 --> 01:10:03,007
Crazy would that be if that's what you could see from your telescope

1369
01:10:03,263 --> 01:10:07,615
You're looking at the moon and you see someone like turn on their porch light

1370
01:10:08,127 --> 01:10:09,407
Like that

1371
01:10:09,663 --> 01:10:15,295
Tell you where the stars are

1372
01:10:15,551 --> 01:10:16,319
There's no

1373
01:10:17,087 --> 01:10:17,599
Champs

1374
01:10:17,855 --> 01:10:18,367
Love you

1375
01:10:18,623 --> 01:10:20,927
No matter how powerful telescope that you have

1376
01:10:21,183 --> 01:10:22,975
That you could look at the Moon and

1377
01:10:23,743 --> 01:10:24,255
Elite

1378
01:10:24,767 --> 01:10:26,303
Phonics

1379
01:10:26,815 --> 01:10:29,887
It would have to be

1380
01:10:30,143 --> 01:10:33,215
Indivisible to your telescope

1381
01:10:34,495 --> 01:10:37,567
The reality is that appear to be light

1382
01:10:38,079 --> 01:10:38,591
It might be a piece

1383
01:10:38,847 --> 01:10:39,359
Flex paste

1384
01:10:39,871 --> 01:10:45,503
Or something like that reflecting light or any number of possible explanations

1385
01:10:45,759 --> 01:10:46,783
So I don't know all of them

1386
01:10:47,039 --> 01:10:48,063
I know there are plenty of

1387
01:10:50,623 --> 01:10:52,671
In the classic pale blue.

1388
01:10:53,439 --> 01:10:54,975
You see a lot of s*** up

1389
01:10:57,279 --> 01:10:58,303
Not not living

1390
01:10:59,071 --> 01:10:59,839
All those lights

1391
01:11:00,351 --> 01:11:03,679
Glow cloud

1392
01:11:05,471 --> 01:11:06,239
Also Florence

1393
01:11:09,055 --> 01:11:10,079
Glow cloud

1394
01:11:10,335 --> 01:11:11,359
I didn't have the

1395
01:11:15,455 --> 01:11:15,967
I didn't have

1396
01:11:16,223 --> 01:11:17,503
The nerve to watch Carrie

1397
01:11:17,759 --> 01:11:19,551
Is two-part interview about that hurricane

1398
01:11:20,063 --> 01:11:21,343
Knock knock

1399
01:11:21,855 --> 01:11:22,623
Involves weather

1400
01:11:23,135 --> 01:11:23,903
Yeah I know

1401
01:11:24,671 --> 01:11:27,999
I decided I'm out I'm out on that one

1402
01:11:29,023 --> 01:11:33,119
A really f***** up for a long time because

1403
01:11:35,167 --> 01:11:35,935
Tomorrow

1404
01:11:42,847 --> 01:11:43,359
In this next

1405
01:11:46,687 --> 01:11:47,711
How do I how do I

1406
01:11:52,063 --> 01:11:55,647
He's just about any

1407
01:11:55,903 --> 01:11:58,207
I guess I guess what I would say is

1408
01:11:58,463 --> 01:11:58,975
He's trying to

1409
01:11:59,231 --> 01:11:59,999
Express

1410
01:12:00,511 --> 01:12:01,023
Again

1411
01:12:01,279 --> 01:12:01,791
He seems

1412
01:12:02,303 --> 01:12:03,839
Fascinated by the idea of

1413
01:12:04,095 --> 01:12:06,143
Resume

1414
01:12:08,191 --> 01:12:10,751
The ability to zoom on a camera seems like almost

1415
01:12:12,799 --> 01:12:14,847
The more I zoom in

1416
01:12:15,359 --> 01:12:16,383
The more I see

1417
01:12:16,895 --> 01:12:18,687
What people are talking about the hologram

1418
01:12:20,991 --> 01:12:21,759
And it's scary

1419
01:12:25,343 --> 01:12:26,879
Michigan looking at a corner

1420
01:12:27,135 --> 01:12:27,903
Spring or something

1421
01:12:28,159 --> 01:12:29,183
Moving

1422
01:12:29,695 --> 01:12:34,559
Unfortunately

1423
01:12:37,887 --> 01:12:40,959
3000 Geary

1424
01:12:41,215 --> 01:12:42,751
You'll never see a mosquito

1425
01:12:43,775 --> 01:12:48,639
You will never like this in the window

1426
01:12:49,407 --> 01:12:51,711
Would be this stressed out

1427
01:12:51,967 --> 01:12:55,039
A blur

1428
01:12:55,295 --> 01:12:57,855
You're arguing against criticism buddy

1429
01:12:59,391 --> 01:13:00,415
That's not that's not a

1430
01:13:00,671 --> 01:13:01,183
Legitimate

1431
01:13:07,839 --> 01:13:09,119
Yeah usually

1432
01:13:11,423 --> 01:13:12,447
I don't know man

1433
01:13:12,959 --> 01:13:15,263
I'm not sure

1434
01:13:15,775 --> 01:13:17,823
Exactly what point you're trying to make with the hologram

1435
01:13:18,335 --> 01:13:18,847
Business

1436
01:13:19,103 --> 01:13:20,895
But I do know that some of these other people like

1437
01:13:22,175 --> 01:13:23,711
Somebody's other weirdos

1438
01:13:25,759 --> 01:13:26,783
Makerspace Carrie cast

1439
01:13:27,039 --> 01:13:27,807
Kind of world

1440
01:13:28,063 --> 01:13:30,367
They do speculate there's like a hologram.

1441
01:13:30,623 --> 01:13:31,391
Going on

1442
01:13:31,647 --> 01:13:32,159
Allow you to

1443
01:13:32,415 --> 01:13:34,463
To see what's actually going on on the moon

1444
01:13:35,743 --> 01:13:37,791
That's okay

1445
01:13:39,583 --> 01:13:41,375
More like if you zoom in

1446
01:13:41,887 --> 01:13:42,399
Far enough on

1447
01:13:44,191 --> 01:13:45,215
Can see that the entire universe

1448
01:13:47,007 --> 01:13:49,823
Now that's interesting I might be what he said I don't know

1449
01:13:50,079 --> 01:13:53,919
We just have to you and I are left you're guessing

1450
01:13:55,199 --> 01:13:56,223
Cuz episode I don't know

1451
01:13:56,479 --> 01:13:57,503
I can't I can't answer that question

1452
01:13:57,759 --> 01:13:58,271
Before you

1453
01:13:58,527 --> 01:14:00,319
Like I don't have more prior contacts

1454
01:14:00,831 --> 01:14:01,599
It's going to help fair enough

1455
01:14:01,855 --> 01:14:03,391
But I can tell you this

1456
01:14:04,671 --> 01:14:07,231
At a certain point became an incredibly boring

1457
01:14:07,999 --> 01:14:12,095
This was one of the rare times that I almost fell asleep

1458
01:14:14,911 --> 01:14:16,191
I'm so interested in

1459
01:14:16,703 --> 01:14:17,727
Is the kernel of it

1460
01:14:17,983 --> 01:14:18,751
Yeah

1461
01:14:19,007 --> 01:14:20,287
After the episodes of hour and a half

1462
01:14:20,799 --> 01:14:23,615
Stretches

1463
01:14:25,919 --> 01:14:28,223
That's a long time for an episode interview

1464
01:14:28,735 --> 01:14:29,759
Interviewing your guy

1465
01:14:30,271 --> 01:14:31,039
With a telescope

1466
01:14:31,551 --> 01:14:32,575
You guys have telescopes

1467
01:14:32,831 --> 01:14:33,599
Confirm

1468
01:14:34,111 --> 01:14:36,415
You might be asking yourself to work

1469
01:14:36,671 --> 01:14:37,183
To the bus station

1470
01:14:37,439 --> 01:14:37,951
Does working

1471
01:14:38,463 --> 01:14:39,743
Interpret ography lights

1472
01:14:39,999 --> 01:14:41,535
She dangles

1473
01:14:45,631 --> 01:14:49,983
We know that he said he started taking pictures of a star that had no idea where it is

1474
01:14:51,519 --> 01:14:53,055
But it's not

1475
01:14:53,567 --> 01:14:54,335
What is assertive

1476
01:14:55,103 --> 01:14:55,615
Story end

1477
01:14:56,639 --> 01:14:57,151
Facebook

1478
01:14:58,431 --> 01:14:59,967
How long have you been doing

1479
01:15:01,503 --> 01:15:03,295
This is my second year completed

1480
01:15:07,391 --> 01:15:09,439
I couldn't even get you an Associates

1481
01:15:09,951 --> 01:15:12,767
Treated my second year of research

1482
01:15:13,023 --> 01:15:14,815
I've never done this before

1483
01:15:15,071 --> 01:15:18,143
I was very interested in the New World Order

1484
01:15:18,399 --> 01:15:21,471
Oh no

1485
01:15:22,239 --> 01:15:28,383
Super fly into something it was involved with the government

1486
01:15:29,919 --> 01:15:30,687
The secret project

1487
01:15:31,967 --> 01:15:35,295
So everything I'm researching now is only from what I'm finding

1488
01:15:40,671 --> 01:15:42,463
I'm researching in debt

1489
01:15:42,719 --> 01:15:43,487
A lot of

1490
01:15:43,743 --> 01:15:44,767
The space program

1491
01:15:47,839 --> 01:15:49,631
What's an estate program

1492
01:15:51,167 --> 01:15:52,703
Maybe there's some similarities

1493
01:15:54,239 --> 01:15:55,775
It could be that I'm finding some

1494
01:15:56,287 --> 01:15:57,823
Faraway evidence

1495
01:15:59,103 --> 01:16:00,639
Maybe the state program

1496
01:16:05,759 --> 01:16:08,575
So I started looking at looking at things I don't

1497
01:16:09,599 --> 01:16:10,111
And then

1498
01:16:11,647 --> 01:16:13,183
Went to the people who do

1499
01:16:13,439 --> 01:16:13,951
Stand up and I was like

1500
01:16:17,023 --> 01:16:18,303
Who don't understand them

1501
01:16:18,559 --> 01:16:19,071
At all

1502
01:16:19,583 --> 01:16:21,887
And I decided to

1503
01:16:22,143 --> 01:16:23,167
The secret

1504
01:16:23,423 --> 01:16:23,935
Bridgeway program

1505
01:16:30,335 --> 01:16:31,359
This is

1506
01:16:31,615 --> 01:16:34,175
I started to get into the Illuminati

1507
01:16:34,687 --> 01:16:35,967
Alright alright

1508
01:16:36,479 --> 01:16:39,295
Okay we're always going to get there soon

1509
01:16:39,551 --> 01:16:43,903
Sooner or later I'm being forthcoming with that information

1510
01:16:44,415 --> 01:16:46,207
So we got one more clip of this dude

1511
01:16:46,463 --> 01:16:46,975
Bruce

1512
01:16:47,231 --> 01:16:47,743
Bezel

1513
01:16:49,791 --> 01:16:50,559
Versus Ali

1514
01:16:51,071 --> 01:16:52,095
I have

1515
01:16:52,351 --> 01:16:53,375
Vindicated

1516
01:16:53,631 --> 01:16:54,399
A couple things

1517
01:16:54,911 --> 01:16:56,191
Lead me to believe that this guy is

1518
01:16:56,447 --> 01:16:57,727
Is not popping up

1519
01:16:57,983 --> 01:16:58,751
In terms of like

1520
01:17:00,799 --> 01:17:02,335
Bunny perspective

1521
01:17:02,591 --> 01:17:04,127
Is the biggest

1522
01:17:04,639 --> 01:17:05,663
More exam

1523
01:17:07,711 --> 01:17:08,479
Oprah for you

1524
01:17:08,735 --> 01:17:10,527
Video how about that

1525
01:17:11,295 --> 01:17:12,319
But this next clip

1526
01:17:12,575 --> 01:17:13,087
Is

1527
01:17:14,367 --> 01:17:15,135
Deeply troubling

1528
01:17:16,671 --> 01:17:17,439
Unjustly

1529
01:17:17,951 --> 01:17:19,231
Understanding reality

1530
01:17:19,487 --> 01:17:19,999
What kind of bass

1531
01:17:20,767 --> 01:17:22,559
Actually maybe

1532
01:17:23,071 --> 01:17:24,863
Just because not because it's those shocking

1533
01:17:25,119 --> 01:17:27,167
You to understand what you say

1534
01:17:28,191 --> 01:17:31,519
Well if you're having some really odd things going on

1535
01:17:32,031 --> 01:17:35,615
I guess it also has to do with maybe the actress that were

1536
01:17:35,871 --> 01:17:37,407
We're shifting

1537
01:17:37,663 --> 01:17:39,711
The sphere on Earth because

1538
01:17:40,223 --> 01:17:42,527
The moon does not appear to be in the same place that you

1539
01:17:46,623 --> 01:17:47,391
Now I'm wondering

1540
01:17:47,903 --> 01:17:48,927
Maybe

1541
01:17:49,439 --> 01:17:50,719
Maybe the moon hasn't moved

1542
01:17:51,487 --> 01:17:52,511
This is just an assumption

1543
01:17:56,351 --> 01:17:58,911
Is rocking back and forth

1544
01:18:00,959 --> 01:18:02,751
Look at the Moon

1545
01:18:06,847 --> 01:18:07,871
We're both moving

1546
01:18:10,431 --> 01:18:11,967
Universe around us

1547
01:18:12,223 --> 01:18:13,247
Going like this

1548
01:18:20,671 --> 01:18:21,951
Everything's

1549
01:18:22,463 --> 01:18:22,975
Spinning around

1550
01:18:28,607 --> 01:18:30,143
But just before it stopped

1551
01:18:30,399 --> 01:18:32,447
Really really really really fast

1552
01:18:32,959 --> 01:18:35,263
And I often say to myself

1553
01:18:48,063 --> 01:18:50,111
Going to be

1554
01:18:53,951 --> 01:18:55,999
8020 years 10 years

1555
01:19:00,863 --> 01:19:01,375
Hoo-boy

1556
01:19:04,447 --> 01:19:05,471
The universe was moving

1557
01:19:09,311 --> 01:19:10,591
When did you learn first

1558
01:19:11,103 --> 01:19:11,615
Bea Arthur

1559
01:19:12,127 --> 01:19:16,735
Second moon was moving around the earth making them both moves

1560
01:19:16,991 --> 01:19:19,551
Ray-Ban pattern

1561
01:19:20,063 --> 01:19:22,367
Both of them also orbiting the Sun

1562
01:19:22,623 --> 01:19:27,487
The sun itself which orbits around the supermassive black hole at the center of our galaxy

1563
01:19:27,743 --> 01:19:31,839
The Galaxy itself which is expanding as part of the University

1564
01:19:32,095 --> 01:19:38,239
Expanding

1565
01:19:40,287 --> 01:19:43,615
Magic or whatever it is the universe is always

1566
01:19:50,783 --> 01:19:51,807
What is the universe

1567
01:19:53,343 --> 01:19:57,695
What is going on

1568
01:19:57,951 --> 01:20:04,095
Cuz that a prerequisite class today after all that much

1569
01:20:04,351 --> 01:20:08,703
Broad stroke

1570
01:20:09,215 --> 01:20:10,495
Moving and not just

1571
01:20:10,751 --> 01:20:16,896
Chilling out

1572
01:20:17,152 --> 01:20:19,712
I got

1573
01:20:19,968 --> 01:20:23,040
Physics class

1574
01:20:23,296 --> 01:20:26,112
Doctor mushroom but I'm not entirely sure

1575
01:20:27,136 --> 01:20:27,904
A professor

1576
01:20:28,160 --> 01:20:31,232
Headed that sounded a lot like doctor mushroom

1577
01:20:31,488 --> 01:20:35,584
Dr. Bruce mushrooms all not care to find out what his real name is but I'm sure

1578
01:20:36,864 --> 01:20:39,680
Background

1579
01:20:39,936 --> 01:20:41,216
To know that it was that doctor mushroom

1580
01:20:41,728 --> 01:20:43,264
Teach me about space

1581
01:20:45,056 --> 01:20:45,824
Dog doo-doo

1582
01:20:46,336 --> 01:20:46,848
Beyond real

1583
01:20:48,384 --> 01:20:49,664
Did he just

1584
01:20:52,992 --> 01:20:59,136
Maybe the universe is moving you have to ask yourself what is the dichotomy that's being presented by Carrie

1585
01:21:00,160 --> 01:21:00,928
And what day is it

1586
01:21:01,184 --> 01:21:01,952
Are you saying

1587
01:21:04,256 --> 01:21:05,536
Now if that were the case

1588
01:21:06,304 --> 01:21:06,816
Disaster

1589
01:21:07,840 --> 01:21:08,352
The tides

1590
01:21:08,608 --> 01:21:10,144
Would be completely

1591
01:21:10,400 --> 01:21:13,472
Devastator

1592
01:21:13,728 --> 01:21:17,056
No

1593
01:21:17,312 --> 01:21:18,080
Had not moved

1594
01:21:18,848 --> 01:21:23,968
Oh yeah that took time out Jordan

1595
01:21:24,224 --> 01:21:29,600
Timeout because the moon not moving is the equivalent of the Moon movie

1596
01:21:29,856 --> 01:21:30,624
The Moon

1597
01:21:30,880 --> 01:21:31,648
Moving

1598
01:21:32,416 --> 01:21:36,768
In her what she's saying is the moon is moving in a way that is not what we would expect

1599
01:21:37,280 --> 01:21:39,584
Alright

1600
01:21:39,840 --> 01:21:41,632
Expected to be based on our calculations

1601
01:21:42,144 --> 01:21:47,776
Feel like his response is more similar to

1602
01:21:48,032 --> 01:21:48,800
Yes yes

1603
01:21:49,312 --> 01:21:54,432
But that's better

1604
01:21:57,760 --> 01:22:00,832
Is equally troubling

1605
01:22:02,368 --> 01:22:05,952
Devastating consequences for the solar system

1606
01:22:06,208 --> 01:22:06,976
A complete

1607
01:22:07,232 --> 01:22:09,536
Everything would be screwed

1608
01:22:09,792 --> 01:22:12,608
Either these possibilities were the case

1609
01:22:12,864 --> 01:22:14,144
Weed Trucking know it by now

1610
01:22:14,400 --> 01:22:15,168
For sure

1611
01:22:15,680 --> 01:22:17,984
Is the confidence that it take

1612
01:22:18,496 --> 01:22:19,008
2

1613
01:22:19,520 --> 01:22:21,312
Fly in the face of every

1614
01:22:21,824 --> 01:22:25,664
Brilliant group of people who have ever studied this

1615
01:22:26,176 --> 01:22:26,688
Ever

1616
01:22:27,712 --> 01:22:33,856
Really astonishing

1617
01:22:34,880 --> 01:22:35,648
Disproven

1618
01:22:38,976 --> 01:22:41,536
Calm down man

1619
01:22:41,792 --> 01:22:44,608
Equal of like Pliny the Elder

1620
01:22:45,376 --> 01:22:46,656
4000 years after

1621
01:22:46,912 --> 01:22:47,680
Pliny the Elder

1622
01:22:48,960 --> 01:22:49,984
It's not a good look

1623
01:22:50,240 --> 01:22:52,288
So this is where we leave Bruce

1624
01:22:53,568 --> 01:22:55,104
Sparks up another bowl or whatever

1625
01:22:56,384 --> 01:22:57,408
Real introspective

1626
01:22:59,968 --> 01:23:00,480
Right

1627
01:23:00,736 --> 01:23:01,760
What if it's not the week

1628
01:23:02,272 --> 01:23:03,040
Burning butt

1629
01:23:03,552 --> 01:23:05,344
I am the one that's all right

1630
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:07,392
So he leave

1631
01:23:07,904 --> 01:23:08,672
F******

1632
01:23:08,928 --> 01:23:09,952
Fortunate posts

1633
01:23:10,464 --> 01:23:10,976
From Carrie

1634
01:23:11,232 --> 01:23:14,048
She doesn't have the episode

1635
01:23:14,560 --> 01:23:15,840
I don't know exactly

1636
01:23:16,096 --> 01:23:19,680
I think maybe because she felt good about starting episode without a gas

1637
01:23:20,192 --> 01:23:20,704
And maybe she's like

1638
01:23:20,960 --> 01:23:23,520
Maybe a little bit

1639
01:23:23,776 --> 01:23:25,056
Unfortunately

1640
01:23:25,568 --> 01:23:27,360
She reveals that things are not

1641
01:23:29,920 --> 01:23:35,296
I am trying to raise money to go see Captain Mark Richards again and do an interview

1642
01:23:35,552 --> 01:23:39,904
And this is a great time for me to do that interview so much is happening

1643
01:23:40,416 --> 01:23:46,560
I want to run a lot of Eddie's information by him see how he sees it and

1644
01:23:46,816 --> 01:23:50,400
See what he's up to and what he understands about was coming

1645
01:23:52,192 --> 01:23:52,704
He's in prison

1646
01:23:52,960 --> 01:23:57,824
In the future here on planet Earth perspective

1647
01:23:58,080 --> 01:24:00,128
From

1648
01:24:03,712 --> 01:24:05,504
But only because of the

1649
01:24:07,296 --> 01:24:09,600
Actors who he's in touch with as well

1650
01:24:09,856 --> 01:24:13,696
So that's a very worthwhile Enterprise if you can

1651
01:24:13,952 --> 01:24:14,464
Donate

1652
01:24:14,720 --> 01:24:15,744
Camelot

1653
01:24:16,512 --> 01:24:20,608
You just go to my website Project Camelot. TV and click on the Donate fat

1654
01:24:21,120 --> 01:24:23,680
And then it gives you several ways to donate

1655
01:24:25,216 --> 01:24:27,776
If you just want to send money to my email address

1656
01:24:28,032 --> 01:24:28,800
You can do it that way

1657
01:24:29,056 --> 01:24:31,360
But I'm not mad at her for asking for money

1658
01:24:32,640 --> 01:24:33,152
Support

1659
01:24:33,408 --> 01:24:35,456
But you.

1660
01:24:35,712 --> 01:24:41,088
New model that should be successful

1661
01:24:41,344 --> 01:24:43,648
Universal

1662
01:24:45,696 --> 01:24:48,000
But I do think even with universal basic

1663
01:24:48,256 --> 01:24:51,328
Drinking with your dad and everyone should have the right to housing

1664
01:24:56,960 --> 01:24:57,984
I do think that a

1665
01:24:58,240 --> 01:24:59,520
The successful model 4 in

1666
01:24:59,776 --> 01:25:00,288
Entertainment

1667
01:25:00,544 --> 01:25:01,568
And that sort of thing is

1668
01:25:02,080 --> 01:25:03,616
Do you like this thing

1669
01:25:04,128 --> 01:25:05,408
Give them a couple boxes

1670
01:25:05,920 --> 01:25:07,200
Enter subscription format

1671
01:25:07,712 --> 01:25:08,480
That allows them

1672
01:25:08,736 --> 01:25:10,784
To be able to create the things that you like

1673
01:25:11,040 --> 01:25:12,320
Which is what they like

1674
01:25:12,576 --> 01:25:14,368
I don't think there's a

1675
01:25:16,928 --> 01:25:20,256
Really don't and I even though I think Carrie is

1676
01:25:20,512 --> 01:25:21,536
Unfortunately

1677
01:25:21,792 --> 01:25:24,352
Pushing a lot of really dangerous stuff into the world

1678
01:25:24,608 --> 01:25:25,120
Weather

1679
01:25:25,888 --> 01:25:28,704
Eddie page saying that racism is totally cool

1680
01:25:28,960 --> 01:25:31,008
Or lot of these people who are

1681
01:25:31,520 --> 01:25:32,800
Hypothetical alien

1682
01:25:33,056 --> 01:25:33,568
Being

1683
01:25:34,080 --> 01:25:36,128
Weirdly into Russia also

1684
01:25:36,384 --> 01:25:37,408
Happened

1685
01:25:37,920 --> 01:25:38,944
Dangerous

1686
01:25:39,200 --> 01:25:39,712
Flippancy in

1687
01:25:39,968 --> 01:25:40,736
Anti-science

1688
01:25:41,504 --> 01:25:42,528
Yak that was sort of thing

1689
01:25:42,784 --> 01:25:43,808
I hate it but I

1690
01:25:44,064 --> 01:25:45,856
I'm not going to be mad at her being like

1691
01:25:46,624 --> 01:25:47,904
Did you like what I do please support it

1692
01:25:48,672 --> 01:25:49,952
I am going to say

1693
01:25:50,464 --> 01:25:50,976
Hey

1694
01:25:51,488 --> 01:25:57,632
What does it cost to go visit someone in prison

1695
01:25:57,888 --> 01:25:58,656
He's money

1696
01:25:58,912 --> 01:26:05,056
The book of flight it doesn't take off like she live in California

1697
01:26:05,312 --> 01:26:06,848
Prison you can drive there

1698
01:26:07,104 --> 01:26:13,248
California roll La I don't know exactly

1699
01:26:13,504 --> 01:26:15,808
At most I've driven down the California coast

1700
01:26:16,064 --> 01:26:16,832
At most like

1701
01:26:18,368 --> 01:26:19,648
At most

1702
01:26:19,904 --> 01:26:24,000
Maybe cost something to have a hotel ghetto f****** Motel 6

1703
01:26:24,768 --> 01:26:29,120
60 bucks for the night or whatever

1704
01:26:37,824 --> 01:26:39,104
The way she's framing it

1705
01:26:39,360 --> 01:26:39,872
Is gross

1706
01:26:40,128 --> 01:26:41,408
Because if it is like

1707
01:26:41,664 --> 01:26:43,712
Hey if you want me to go and

1708
01:26:43,968 --> 01:26:45,248
Do this as a

1709
01:26:45,504 --> 01:26:46,016
The bonus

1710
01:26:46,528 --> 01:26:47,808
You can support that

1711
01:26:48,064 --> 01:26:50,112
That kind of feels better but the idea of like

1712
01:26:50,624 --> 01:26:52,160
I need money to do this

1713
01:26:52,672 --> 01:26:54,720
Is gross because it doesn't

1714
01:26:56,768 --> 01:26:57,280
It doesn't cost

1715
01:26:57,536 --> 01:26:58,048
Much

1716
01:26:58,304 --> 01:26:59,584
Call Tatanka gas

1717
01:26:59,840 --> 01:27:01,632
And maybe a cheap hotel

1718
01:27:02,912 --> 01:27:04,192
He is a guy in prison

1719
01:27:04,704 --> 01:27:06,752
Now on the other hand

1720
01:27:07,264 --> 01:27:08,800
The other hand is this

1721
01:27:09,568 --> 01:27:11,104
I think that there's a possibility

1722
01:27:11,360 --> 01:27:12,384
Mark is charging her

1723
01:27:12,640 --> 01:27:13,152
How to do interviews

1724
01:27:13,408 --> 01:27:14,176
I don't

1725
01:27:15,456 --> 01:27:17,760
There's a bunny

1726
01:27:18,016 --> 01:27:19,296
Interviewing him isn't

1727
01:27:19,808 --> 01:27:21,856
She needs to put something in his commissary

1728
01:27:22,112 --> 01:27:24,160
In order for him to agree to do an interview

1729
01:27:24,416 --> 01:27:26,720
So maybe there is

1730
01:27:30,048 --> 01:27:30,816
It's absolutely

1731
01:27:31,072 --> 01:27:33,120
Illegal

1732
01:27:33,632 --> 01:27:34,144
What could it be

1733
01:27:34,400 --> 01:27:34,912
Charging

1734
01:27:38,496 --> 01:27:42,336
Like what is he charged us $500 in his commissary

1735
01:27:42,592 --> 01:27:43,360
Very easy to do it

1736
01:27:43,616 --> 01:27:46,688
It's a version of extortion

1737
01:27:46,944 --> 01:27:48,224
The people in prison

1738
01:27:48,736 --> 01:27:49,248
I do not know

1739
01:27:49,504 --> 01:27:54,112
Oh absolutely I apologize for not having enough

1740
01:27:58,208 --> 01:28:00,000
Present but not ones that I visit

1741
01:28:00,256 --> 01:28:00,768
Prison wanted

1742
01:28:01,536 --> 01:28:03,328
Will do is extort other other prisoners

1743
01:28:03,584 --> 01:28:05,120
To get them to get their loved one

1744
01:28:05,376 --> 01:28:05,888
To put money

1745
01:28:06,144 --> 01:28:06,656
Commissary

1746
01:28:07,680 --> 01:28:08,704
The threat that they will hurt

1747
01:28:08,960 --> 01:28:12,800
If they don't do it surprising economy within prison

1748
01:28:19,200 --> 01:28:22,528
There's a documentary that Lewis the road

1749
01:28:22,784 --> 01:28:23,552
I believe it was about

1750
01:28:24,576 --> 01:28:27,136
Are you stalking

1751
01:28:28,160 --> 01:28:29,184
I still think about very

1752
01:28:29,696 --> 01:28:30,464
Very happy

1753
01:28:34,048 --> 01:28:35,328
There's this guy

1754
01:28:36,352 --> 01:28:36,864
Mentality

1755
01:28:41,728 --> 01:28:43,008
The game ain't based on

1756
01:28:43,776 --> 01:28:45,824
Which is the idea that like I will extort you

1757
01:28:46,336 --> 01:28:47,360
I will do everything

1758
01:28:47,616 --> 01:28:48,640
I don't give a s*** about you

1759
01:28:48,896 --> 01:28:49,408
Humanity

1760
01:28:49,664 --> 01:28:50,688
Sympathy doesn't come into

1761
01:28:51,456 --> 01:28:51,968
So

1762
01:28:52,480 --> 01:28:54,528
I don't necessarily think that Mark Richards is

1763
01:28:54,784 --> 01:28:57,088
Shaking down people or anything like

1764
01:28:57,344 --> 01:28:58,624
But he's got a fish on the line

1765
01:28:59,136 --> 01:29:03,744
Gary is his being able to be like I will tell you more about this

1766
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:05,024
Secret space program

1767
01:29:05,280 --> 01:29:06,560
If you give me money

1768
01:29:06,816 --> 01:29:09,376
Right cuz I need that to do all my need to get toilet

1769
01:29:15,264 --> 01:29:15,776
Hey

1770
01:29:16,288 --> 01:29:19,360
The Conners

1771
01:29:22,944 --> 01:29:24,224
That there might be more going on

1772
01:29:24,480 --> 01:29:24,992
On here then

1773
01:29:25,504 --> 01:29:26,016
Then is

1774
01:29:26,272 --> 01:29:27,296
Which somehow

1775
01:29:27,552 --> 01:29:28,064
Makes

1776
01:29:30,368 --> 01:29:32,160
The only rational actor in the

1777
01:29:32,416 --> 01:29:32,928
This entire situation

1778
01:29:33,440 --> 01:29:34,208
Well yeah

1779
01:29:34,720 --> 01:29:40,096
I mean it's horrible

1780
01:29:40,864 --> 01:29:42,144
Reasonable

1781
01:29:46,496 --> 01:29:47,008
We've opted

1782
01:29:47,264 --> 01:29:51,872
He said that he's just like he's a board dude but it makes way more sense for him to be like

1783
01:29:52,384 --> 01:29:58,016
Yeah I'll do an interview where I'll say all kinds of crazy s*** to you for

1784
01:29:58,528 --> 01:30:00,064
Yeah that makes perfect

1785
01:30:00,320 --> 01:30:02,112
So that clip kind of brought that thought

1786
01:30:02,368 --> 01:30:02,880
Into my mind

1787
01:30:04,160 --> 01:30:04,672
Which is interest

1788
01:30:05,696 --> 01:30:07,744
It certainly it certainly in line with a lot of these

1789
01:30:08,256 --> 01:30:09,536
Starting to find out about

1790
01:30:10,048 --> 01:30:10,560
The guests on

1791
01:30:10,816 --> 01:30:12,864
Jim Bakker Show

1792
01:30:13,376 --> 01:30:16,192
Understanding Baker 5000 books

1793
01:30:16,448 --> 01:30:17,216
Exactly

1794
01:30:18,496 --> 01:30:20,032
And I believe that there's certain Arrangements

1795
01:30:20,288 --> 01:30:21,568
It's like that with Alex

1796
01:30:22,848 --> 01:30:23,360
I do think

1797
01:30:23,616 --> 01:30:24,128
There are similar

1798
01:30:24,384 --> 01:30:24,896
Things going on

1799
01:30:25,152 --> 01:30:25,920
With Alex's

1800
01:30:26,432 --> 01:30:26,944
Consignment

1801
01:30:28,224 --> 01:30:30,016
Yeah so I think there is

1802
01:30:30,272 --> 01:30:31,040
A much more

1803
01:30:32,064 --> 01:30:34,624
Nuanced economy behind the program

1804
01:30:36,672 --> 01:30:37,440
Now unfortunate

1805
01:30:38,208 --> 01:30:40,512
Well the reason that we don't really understand these

1806
01:30:40,768 --> 01:30:41,280
Economies is

1807
01:30:43,072 --> 01:30:45,632
Don't do that no

1808
01:30:53,312 --> 01:30:54,336
For the insurance

1809
01:30:54,592 --> 01:30:59,456
8 interest of putting on a good Publix did that and then

1810
01:30:59,712 --> 01:31:02,784
The first thing we say Talega anybody that we interview

1811
01:31:03,552 --> 01:31:09,440
Hey we bought five thousand of this guy's book we hope you guys buy we're going to mark it up in order to

1812
01:31:09,696 --> 01:31:10,720
Get our cut of the profit

1813
01:31:17,376 --> 01:31:19,168
That's why I had to cut out 10 minutes

1814
01:31:19,424 --> 01:31:21,728
Mike Kaplan interview

1815
01:31:22,496 --> 01:31:23,776
Micro going to sell your seat

1816
01:31:24,288 --> 01:31:25,312
Yeah

1817
01:31:25,568 --> 01:31:27,104
Gets worse

1818
01:31:27,616 --> 01:31:28,128
Because

1819
01:31:30,176 --> 01:31:31,200
Thing else that leads

1820
01:31:31,456 --> 01:31:32,224
Me to believe that

1821
01:31:32,736 --> 01:31:33,248
Again

1822
01:31:33,504 --> 01:31:34,272
All is not well

1823
01:31:35,808 --> 01:31:36,832
Basically we just

1824
01:31:37,088 --> 01:31:38,112
You do need money

1825
01:31:38,368 --> 01:31:39,392
To operate

1826
01:31:39,904 --> 01:31:45,024
Wasn't able to pay my Webster last week

1827
01:31:45,280 --> 01:31:47,840
Actually really down and out financially

1828
01:31:48,096 --> 01:31:48,864
Because

1829
01:31:50,912 --> 01:31:53,984
Over the summer

1830
01:31:54,240 --> 01:31:56,288
So I laid out on a bunch of

1831
01:31:56,544 --> 01:31:57,568
Credit cards

1832
01:31:57,824 --> 01:31:58,592
Travelan

1833
01:31:58,848 --> 01:32:02,688
You can help out you know even a little bit helps

1834
01:32:02,944 --> 01:32:04,736
Appreciate it

1835
01:32:04,992 --> 01:32:05,760
Carrie's falling in

1836
01:32:06,016 --> 01:32:07,040
Into debt carry

1837
01:32:07,296 --> 01:32:07,808
Carrie

1838
01:32:08,320 --> 01:32:08,832
Carrie

1839
01:32:09,344 --> 01:32:11,392
Do you remember when you got

1840
01:32:11,648 --> 01:32:12,928
Scammed by that guy

1841
01:32:13,184 --> 01:32:16,256
To the tune of hundreds of thousands of dollars

1842
01:32:17,024 --> 01:32:17,536
10000

1843
01:32:18,304 --> 01:32:21,888
Sean David Morton

1844
01:32:23,680 --> 01:32:25,984
It wasn't it wasn't his fault

1845
01:32:26,496 --> 01:32:27,008
This is why

1846
01:32:27,776 --> 01:32:28,544
I don't want to

1847
01:32:28,800 --> 01:32:30,080
I don't want to be the guy who says

1848
01:32:31,616 --> 01:32:32,128
You got this

1849
01:32:34,688 --> 01:32:36,480
I do know that money that you didn't have

1850
01:32:36,736 --> 01:32:37,760
This summer

1851
01:32:38,272 --> 01:32:39,040
Cuz you didn't pay your taxes

1852
01:32:41,856 --> 01:32:48,000
She was posting about how she needed a bunch of money because you owed

1853
01:32:48,256 --> 01:32:51,328
Backpacks I did not remember what happened

1854
01:32:51,584 --> 01:32:53,376
After tax season what

1855
01:32:55,168 --> 01:32:57,728
It's tragic I feel bad about it but this is

1856
01:32:59,264 --> 01:33:00,032
This all makes sense

1857
01:33:01,056 --> 01:33:02,592
Advertising

1858
01:33:02,848 --> 01:33:03,360
Amitriptyline

1859
01:33:04,128 --> 01:33:06,176
No she will take people and show them around Egypt

1860
01:33:06,688 --> 01:33:07,712
3500

1861
01:33:07,968 --> 01:33:09,248
$50

1862
01:33:09,504 --> 01:33:10,784
Around Egypt

1863
01:33:11,552 --> 01:33:13,856
Flight not included

1864
01:33:14,880 --> 01:33:15,392
To get to EJ

1865
01:33:15,904 --> 01:33:16,416
Critics

1866
01:33:16,928 --> 01:33:18,208
Right

1867
01:33:18,720 --> 01:33:20,512
I don't know flight

1868
01:33:20,768 --> 01:33:21,280
You're not

1869
01:33:23,072 --> 01:33:24,096
Dog

1870
01:33:24,608 --> 01:33:26,144
I'm in the belly of the plane

1871
01:33:26,656 --> 01:33:27,168
That's why

1872
01:33:27,424 --> 01:33:27,936
78 hunt

1873
01:33:28,192 --> 01:33:31,520
$3,550

1874
01:33:32,288 --> 01:33:34,080
Other than bracket

1875
01:33:35,360 --> 01:33:35,872
Discover because

1876
01:33:36,384 --> 01:33:38,176
She's assuming that you'll be in a hotel

1877
01:33:39,200 --> 01:33:40,224
We got to pay for your other

1878
01:33:44,064 --> 01:33:44,832
I think

1879
01:33:45,344 --> 01:33:48,928
It's unclear from the

1880
01:33:49,184 --> 01:33:51,232
Itinerary

1881
01:33:51,488 --> 01:33:53,536
Kind of unclear I'm not entirely sure

1882
01:33:54,048 --> 01:33:59,168
What's it called amenities not include Star cruise

1883
01:33:59,424 --> 01:34:05,568
I like a four-day 5-star Cruise right that might be worth 35

1884
01:34:06,080 --> 01:34:07,360
Problem

1885
01:34:08,640 --> 01:34:09,408
Anyway

1886
01:34:09,664 --> 01:34:10,176

1902
01:34:56,768 --> 01:34:59,840
Talking about pedophilia in Hollywood

1903
01:35:01,120 --> 01:35:01,632
And

1904
01:35:01,888 --> 01:35:03,680
You know so

01:35:03,936 --> 01:35:07,776
It will be great when he gets around to coming on the show

1906
01:35:08,032 --> 01:35:12,640
Isaac Kappy the guy who said it's for real

1907
01:35:12,896 --> 01:35:16,224
The guy who said that you wanted to talk to him about chicken

1908
01:35:16,480 --> 01:35:18,272
And that means that he's a pedophile

1909
01:35:18,784 --> 01:35:23,136
Yep. Who was on Alex Jones Isaac Kappy

1910
01:35:23,392 --> 01:35:23,904
Project

1911
01:35:24,928 --> 01:35:27,232
Do to be like have a conference do they hang out

1912
01:35:27,744 --> 01:35:31,328
Images of producer of Project Camelot like

1913
01:35:33,120 --> 01:35:38,240
I apologize I forgot to bring this up in that last what she was talking about her webmaster not being able to pay him

1914
01:35:39,008 --> 01:35:41,824
The last time we did an episode about Eddie page

1915
01:35:42,336 --> 01:35:43,104
On that episode

1916
01:35:43,360 --> 01:35:45,920
She's talking about how her webmaster disappeared

1917
01:35:46,176 --> 01:35:48,224
And that you needed to get a replacement

1918
01:35:48,480 --> 01:35:49,504
Webmaster

1919
01:35:49,760 --> 01:35:52,576
And she does not talk about it in the context of I couldn't pay him

1920
01:35:52,832 --> 01:35:58,976
Webmaster disappearing is probably

1921
01:35:59,232 --> 01:36:00,512
Man tried to come down on you

1922
01:36:00,768 --> 01:36:01,280
And she was like

1923
01:36:01,536 --> 01:36:02,816
Yeah probably

1924
01:36:03,072 --> 01:36:09,216
So she was presenting it as a thing was like yeah

1925
01:36:09,472 --> 01:36:10,240
Program or whatever

1926
01:36:10,496 --> 01:36:12,032
She would call it

1927
01:36:12,288 --> 01:36:17,408
It turns out very concrete. You didn't want to work

1928
01:36:17,920 --> 01:36:18,944
There's a concrete explanation

1929
01:36:19,200 --> 01:36:19,712
For everything that you

1930
01:36:19,968 --> 01:36:20,480
You claiming some

1931
01:36:21,248 --> 01:36:21,760
A jack

1932
01:36:22,016 --> 01:36:23,040
The same way that you would like

1933
01:36:23,552 --> 01:36:25,600
Weird cyber weapon coming at me

Stop with this b*******

1936
01:36:30,720 --> 01:36:31,488
I understand

1937
01:36:34,816 --> 01:36:35,840
How to make money

1938
01:36:36,352 --> 01:36:37,632
When you're doing something

1939
01:36:38,144 --> 01:36:39,680
I get that

1940
01:36:41,728 --> 01:36:43,264
Empathetic

1941
01:36:44,800 --> 01:36:45,568
Yeah

1942
01:36:46,080 --> 01:36:51,712
How blind you cannot have Isaac Kappy on your f****** show

1943
01:36:58,112 --> 01:37:00,928
Minimizing of pedophilia

1944
01:37:01,696 --> 01:37:02,464
He's a failed

1945
01:37:02,976 --> 01:37:04,256
F*** you

1946
01:37:08,096 --> 01:37:09,888
He's acting like he's a witch

1947
01:37:11,168 --> 01:37:12,192
He's a badass

1948
01:37:12,448 --> 01:37:13,472
He's a bad face Act

1949
01:37:13,728 --> 01:37:14,496
The bad

1950
01:37:14,752 --> 01:37:15,264
Actor

1951
01:37:15,520 --> 01:37:17,824
Good enough to get on that Project Camelot and

1952
01:37:18,336 --> 01:37:18,848
Alex Jones

1953
01:37:20,384 --> 01:37:20,896
Is that what it's called

1954
01:37:22,432 --> 01:37:23,712
I wonder if he could Rebrand

1955
01:37:26,272 --> 01:37:32,416
It said you like I did

1956
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:38,048
Yummy already called the show the final Edition

1957
01:37:40,864 --> 01:37:42,912
Slayer to it book

1958
01:37:45,728 --> 01:37:46,240
6 kids

1959
01:37:47,776 --> 01:37:48,544
Probably aliens

1960
01:37:48,800 --> 01:37:50,592
Got to talk to Alex

1961
01:37:52,384 --> 01:37:53,408
Results

1962
01:37:56,992 --> 01:38:02,624
So Jordan This brings us to the end of this

1963
01:38:02,880 --> 01:38:04,160
Respond for me on a number of lava

1964
01:38:04,672 --> 01:38:05,440
Because this guy

1965
01:38:07,744 --> 01:38:08,512
He's not even

1966
01:38:08,768 --> 01:38:10,560
Crazy in like crazy

1967
01:38:11,584 --> 01:38:12,864
He's just bad

1968
01:38:13,888 --> 01:38:16,704
He just doesn't know what he's talking about and is managed to trick

1969
01:38:17,472 --> 01:38:21,312
Couple hundred people and I give him enough credibility to come on

1970
01:38:21,568 --> 01:38:22,080
Program

1971
01:38:22,592 --> 01:38:23,616
And even say anything

1972
01:38:23,872 --> 01:38:24,384
Two offensive

1973
01:38:24,640 --> 01:38:27,456
To her worldviews that goes along with it quite well

1974
01:38:27,712 --> 01:38:28,224
But

1975
01:38:28,480 --> 01:38:30,784
I would argue that at the end of this podcast

1976
01:38:32,064 --> 01:38:33,856
Squarely on the stupid

1977
01:38:34,112 --> 01:38:34,624
The end of the

1978
01:38:34,880 --> 01:38:35,392
You stupid

1979
01:38:38,208 --> 01:38:44,352
That's kind of a bunch of stupid kind of dumb

1980
01:38:44,608 --> 01:38:46,400
Expressions

1981
01:38:47,680 --> 01:38:49,472
Rotary

1982
01:38:49,728 --> 01:38:55,104
Letter like the Unabomber with a series of steps

1983
01:38:55,360 --> 01:38:55,872
That you would

1984
01:38:56,128 --> 01:38:58,432
Takes that's a different story than a guy who

1985
01:38:58,688 --> 01:38:59,712
It might as well be

1986
01:39:00,224 --> 01:39:06,368
Or liberal or like to be found personal information

1987
01:39:06,624 --> 01:39:12,256
Yeah I just blow their

1988
01:39:12,512 --> 01:39:13,536
Studio a whatever

1989
01:39:14,048 --> 01:39:15,328
Without any evidence

1990
01:39:15,584 --> 01:39:17,888
Early I think

1991
01:39:19,680 --> 01:39:20,192
Perspective

1992
01:39:20,448 --> 01:39:22,496
Absolutely

1993
01:39:22,752 --> 01:39:23,776
Make me on your siding

1994
01:39:26,080 --> 01:39:28,896
He's calling man for sure but maybe not as robust

1995
01:39:29,152 --> 01:39:29,664
Career of

1996
01:39:30,432 --> 01:39:36,064
But I think I've used

1997
01:39:36,576 --> 01:39:38,880

You know

2040
01:41:57,632 --> 01:41:59,168
There's just one thing that's been in the back

2041
01:42:01,728 --> 01:42:02,240
Which is that

2042
01:42:02,496 --> 01:42:03,520
Bruce sees all

2043
01:42:04,032 --> 01:42:05,312

Number things

Certainly

2051
01:42:20,160 --> 01:42:21,184
That would be really important

2052
01:42:21,440 --> 01:42:21,952
Right
