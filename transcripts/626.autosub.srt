1
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:20,736
Air Jordan

2
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:27,136
I have great respect but knowledge B I'm sick of them posing as if they're the good guys

3
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:56,320
Knowledge fight

4
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:57,088
Dot-com

5
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:02,464
Everybody was right on that

6
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:05,280
Alex

7
00:01:05,536 --> 00:01:06,304
Joe

8
00:01:07,328 --> 00:01:09,632
Jordan

9
00:01:10,656 --> 00:01:12,704
I struggled with this

10
00:01:13,984 --> 00:01:17,568
Up and down

11
00:01:17,824 --> 00:01:18,336
Because

12
00:01:18,592 --> 00:01:20,640
I struggle with

13
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,712
Being into things that are too popular

14
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:26,784
Sure wish that I had pasted that were like

15
00:01:27,552 --> 00:01:33,696
Under

16
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:40,096
I got recommended a video on YouTube I don't know how just popped up and it was of these dudes dropping something from a really high height

17
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:42,144
And watching it the fall

18
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:45,216
I love it and I

19
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:48,032
Got really hooked it's hard not to see something

20
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:50,080
Big beautiful in

21
00:01:50,336 --> 00:01:52,896
And to channel called to how ridiculous

22
00:01:53,408 --> 00:01:56,224
And they're like dudes from Australia

23
00:01:57,248 --> 00:01:58,784
Steve millions of views on their videos

24
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,160
Come to my attention but I didn't know that they were these

25
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:09,792
People getting Billy interviews dropping things from a high height don't know anymore

26
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:16,192
Because if there's so many fractures like there's many fractures that there are in the bulletproof glass when they act

27
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:21,056
445 m in the air

28
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:22,848
Viewership for

29
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:23,872
CNN is like

30
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:24,896
700000

31
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:28,736
Everybody knows CNN but 700,000

32
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:30,016
F****** nobody

33
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:36,928
So it's like of course you know CNN and it's only watch by 700,000 people but these f****** are in the

34
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:37,952
YouTube

35
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:40,512
Amazon 24 hours a day

36
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:42,304
It's it would be

37
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,328
Be tough to tell

38
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:49,728
How much viewership there would be of guys who drop things from really high

39
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:53,056
Are or even if it was just appointment television

40
00:02:53,824 --> 00:02:56,896
Tough to say what kind of readings it would get if it wasn't something you could do

41
00:02:57,152 --> 00:02:58,944
Just click and watch

42
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,992
Mora MN watch more

43
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:03,552
Given that to me when I was high at 4

44
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:09,952
13 that would be all my friends and I did everything like 20 years ago

45
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:16,608
It feels a little bit like jackass but without the meme

46
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:18,656
Nobody getting hurt

47
00:03:18,912 --> 00:03:19,424
Fantastic

48
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,240
Yeah but I struggle with

49
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:25,056
A very popular thing that a lot of people

50
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:28,384
Know about tonight just heard about it like I have business trip

51
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:33,760
Every big on Tik-Tok that is true that is true

52
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:35,296
Yeah yeah

53
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:36,832
Events that that whole world

54
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,136
Never never shall I

55
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:40,928
Even if people tell me that people are dropping

56
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:44,768
Things things from really high up on tiktok I'm still not going to check it out

57
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,192
Maybe the best batch

58
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:56,032
Chex Mix ever made in my entire life it's fantastic

59
00:03:56,288 --> 00:03:57,824
I only cook two things

60
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,360
At a professional

61
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:01,408
Potatoes

62
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:07,296
And Chex Mix

63
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:12,416
Me and Angela Lansbury too much for that

64
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:14,464
Who's not great ham

65
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,095
But this was an especially good batch what about air fryer

66
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:26,495
Chicken that one wasn't that wasn't how he's going to go

67
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:32,895
I think you eventually got that one together right

68
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:39,295
That one real wrong I actually was not there for that

69
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:40,831
To try this Chex Mix

70
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:46,207
Fortunately did not have any for the show so I can't vouch for you but what is it

71
00:04:46,463 --> 00:04:46,975
Timer

72
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:51,327
On the next episode the Chex Mix

73
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:52,607
Well that was it

74
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:53,375
It's not it's going to

75
00:04:56,959 --> 00:05:00,799
We'll see we'll see if I even remember by the time

76
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:08,479
We're in the present Davis

77
00:05:08,735 --> 00:05:10,783
Is Thursday of the week that was

78
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:11,551
Last

79
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:14,879
Do you like that we had a week it was the Thursday of it

80
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:18,975
There's kind of a specific reason that I decided

81
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:20,255
The truth episode

82
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:22,047
And spoiler alert

83
00:05:22,303 --> 00:05:24,351
It's because Alex is a little bit mad

84
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:25,119
At a certain point

85
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:26,655
About Vice article

86
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:32,799
That I was interviewed for responded to some of that

87
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:39,199
That's Tuff

88
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:46,879
The first false flag football thank you so much you're now policy walk

89
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:58,911
Ewok

90
00:05:59,423 --> 00:06:00,191
I'm a policy wonk

91
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:05,567
Spotify wrapped Saline

92
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:12,223
Blizzard lizard wizard love Serena thank you so much you are now apology

93
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:15,807
Thank you very much thank you all

94
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:18,367
Restart off here on Thursday

95
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:19,647
Congrat with Alex

96
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:21,695
Talking pretty extreme

97
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:23,743
He also wants to remind you

98
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:24,767
Hindi always

99
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:34,751
World's been artificially put into a Cascade of crises

100
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:37,823
Control

101
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:42,943
Sure

102
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:44,735
Broadcast

103
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:48,319
Predictions

104
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:50,623
Off in the future I said 25-30 years

105
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:54,719
Collapse of civilization and the

106
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:07,775
Anymore doesn't work here

107
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:09,823
That kind of talk I never really would

108
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:13,407
Think I would describe as fanciful let's not be term I would use

109
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:17,759
Who's a really sad attempt on Alex's BART to misrepresent how he carried himself in

110
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:18,783
Earlier career

111
00:07:19,295 --> 00:07:22,623
He's pretending that is a present-day saying that the end is right in front of our faces

112
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:25,695
Years ago he would say that the end was coming in 20 years

113
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:27,743
It's almost like

114
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:29,535
Totally right about everything

115
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:34,143
Complete Vindication of everything he's ever believed right then this is total horseshit

116
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:40,543
It is earlier career Alex is very similar to how he is now but he would just say that the globalist or 10 years behind and their play

117
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:41,567
Planes or whatever

118
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:42,591
When is predictions dating

119
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:43,615
Come to pass

120
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:46,431
He didn't say that in 20 years should be going down

121
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:48,735
You saying what disaster was coming imminently

122
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:50,015
Pretty consistent

123
00:07:50,783 --> 00:07:54,623
I could go through many examples of this so how over the years it was just

124
00:07:55,135 --> 00:08:00,511
Consistent pattern because it's more fun this way here's a clip of him from May 5th 1998

125
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:04,351
Where he predicts that within two years there will be complete martial law

126
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:06,143
With hit teams roaming the streets

127
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:08,959
Two years you have a massive crash in the

128
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:10,495
You have a match

129
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:13,567
Criminal consolidation of wealth you have a police state

130
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:15,359
Rounded up wholesale

131
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:17,407
You barely hear about on the news

132
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:19,199
You will have six

133
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:20,479
Excessive vomiting

134
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:24,063
Coming out

135
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:24,831
Until

136
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:26,111
The governor

137
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:28,671
People being killed.

138
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:29,695
Local

139
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:31,743
Sheriff being killed being in prison

140
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,559
Squadron all over the nation

141
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:35,327
Killing people

142
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:36,863
Get ready

143
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:40,959
They didn't do nothing

144
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:45,823
Alex never predicted the collapses were coming 20 years down the line because that's not good for business

145
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:48,127
One of Alex's most essential tools

146
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:50,687
In terms of f****** with his audience that is created

147
00:08:50,943 --> 00:08:51,711
Sense of emergency

148
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:53,503
See where the information he's yelling about his

149
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:54,783
The most important thing

150
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:56,063
Right now

151
00:08:56,319 --> 00:09:00,415
And that's something you're trying to make someone scared of something that's supposed to happen into decade

152
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:05,791
The difference between Oz earlier career in now is that we're currently in the middle of a protractor

153
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:07,839
Societal challenge in the form of covid

154
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:10,911
And it's something that fits very perfectly into a strategy of making people

155
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:12,703
Scared of how the end is right around

156
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:13,471
The corner

157
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:19,103
He's smart enough to know that his fear-mongering and doomsday s*** sounds way less convincing Than People realize he's been doing

158
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:20,895
Exact same thing for years

159
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:27,295
In the way around that is pretend that all along you've been saying that this big thing was coming aways off in the future which would coincide with

160
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:28,575
Insane owl

161
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:30,111
The end is here

162
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:34,975
Like I said it was going to be here

163
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:41,375
Maybe a little bit like if Nostradamus is writings we're actually like he said all of that stuff was going to happen tomorrow and then when

164
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:47,519
When did news 1000 years from now how about that Nostradamus

165
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:50,335
Long-winded RadioShack

166
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:54,175
Recovery time

167
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:55,455
Yeah it would be rhyme

168
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:56,223
And that's no fun

169
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:57,759
Actually I would like Alex

170
00:09:58,015 --> 00:10:00,575
Stride

171
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:06,719
Navigate to make things a little interesting

172
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:11,071
Studio is a little ominous it's looking a little bit too spooky

173
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:12,095
Today

174
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:14,143
Describes why

175
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:18,751
The u.s. cap

176
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:23,103
Winifred storms in the back

177
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:26,943
Describe

178
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:29,503
Free evil

179
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:31,295
That ass control of our government

180
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:32,575
Almost every level

181
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:33,855
We are the bad guys

182
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:35,647
We have been captured

183
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:43,839
We became the most powerful wealthy love Nation the world still at incredible problems but because

184
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:46,911
We had a Christian but also rugged Western

185
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:48,703
Renaissance

186
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:52,543
What are the freest greatest most productive Nation on Earth

187
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:54,335
Took over

188
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:58,943
We have become a slave

189
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:02,271
Of the New World Order

190
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:05,087
The wages of sin are death

191
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:07,391
What's up what is

192
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:09,439
Feels just like Christian nationalism

193
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:11,743
I'm poking its little head up again

194
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:15,583
Cuz I mean like it's got to be that the thing that went bad was

195
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:20,703
Bakeries not Christian anymore

196
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:22,495
Outside of marriage

197
00:11:22,751 --> 00:11:25,311
Because I don't feel like it's that we're not rugged enough

198
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:29,663
That's not the complaint Alex

199
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:36,063
He might make a complaint much rugged about going to the grocery store when you

200
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:37,599
You're hungry I will admit that

201
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:41,439
You know instead of going out and shooting the Bison

202
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:42,463
Do

203
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:47,327
Push a herd of bison over a cliff in order to insure my son

204
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:48,863
Sustenance for the following winter

205
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:50,399
It is less rugged

206
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:56,031
Certainly doordash who really struggled with

207
00:11:57,055 --> 00:11:58,079
The Unabomber is against

208
00:11:58,335 --> 00:11:59,359
Did it probably less rugged than

209
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:01,151
Then you would like

210
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:03,199
Do the government is captured because

211
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:04,479
Circle

212
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:05,503
Christian

213
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:06,271
The Orient

214
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:08,063
The policies aren't what is

215
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:09,855
Is flaw

216
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:14,207
The laws of Deuteronomy should probably run most adult

217
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:18,303
Although I don't think Alex would particularly like it if that kind of like

218
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:22,399
Theocratic State we're actually enacted to be a real problem

219
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:23,679
Well I mean

220
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:29,055
Like it really like it it's Austin was a dry county

221
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:30,847
I don't think sad and

222
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:32,383
Let's see how prohibition did first

223
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:34,687
So Alex has

224
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:35,967
Some weird ideas

225
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:37,247
On this episode

226
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:38,527
And here's one of them

227
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:41,855
There's a number of things that just even Felix stray thoughts

228
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:44,159
Better

229
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:44,927
But also see

230
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:46,463
Disconnected from anything else

231
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:47,231
She's talking about

232
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:50,047
That's why you see them letting murderers out of jail

233
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:53,119
Robbers out after a week

234
00:12:56,191 --> 00:12:58,239
Yeezys release the next day because he's black

235
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:02,847
All of that is being done to totally undermined changed

236
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:05,407
Put you in a state of confusion

237
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:09,247
Show that you'll accept

238
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:14,111
On your phone even leave your house

239
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:17,439
The great reset

240
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:19,231
Confused

241
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:19,999
Okay

242
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:22,047
So all of the bad that

243
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:23,327
It's being done

244
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:25,119
To confuse me

245
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:26,655
Well into being like

246
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:27,935
I'm going to use

247
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:34,335
The Euro guy who shot people at a school was released on bail

248
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:37,407
Use the euro right

249
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:46,111
I must get involved with great recent because this guy got a bond

250
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:48,671
Armed robbery

251
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:51,231
Got out of prison on bail

252
00:13:51,487 --> 00:13:54,815
So now I am going to be

253
00:13:55,071 --> 00:14:00,447
Define with vaccines KB also that this person got released from jail because they were black

254
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:04,287
I am going to need a vaccine after

255
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:09,919
You tell me that to the other cases like an armed robbery or murder I've no idea what he's talking about

256
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:10,943
Internet is

257
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:11,711
Clear

258
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:12,991
Is about Timothy Simcoe

259
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:16,063
Play an 18 year old student at High School in Arlington

260
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:16,831
Send Texas

261
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:20,671
He's accused of injuring four people including one teacher and a shooting

262
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:25,023
He was released on a $75,000 Bond and is currently under house arrest and wearing

263
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:26,047
GPS monitor

264
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:27,839
Simkins wasn't released

265
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:28,863
Because he's black

266
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:31,935
Any still going to be most likely to a bit

267
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:32,703
Trouble

268
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:36,031
What are the reasons you probably released on bond is because no one was

269
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:36,799
Killed

270
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:37,567
Also there

271
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:40,895
Some strong indications that he was acting in what his family is called Selfish

272
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:46,271
According to a relative Simpkins have been robbed multiple times by bullies at school in the

273
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:48,319
The theory is that he was the target for that kind of thing

274
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:50,367
Because it came from a well-off family

275
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:57,023
None of this justifies shooting people but it does factor into whether or not you would think it was a risk to send someone out on

276
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:57,791
Bond

277
00:14:58,047 --> 00:15:00,351
But Alex is this story the only relevant details

278
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:03,167
The Simpsons is black so that must be why he's out on bond

279
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:07,007
It's really tough to compare the circumstances of different school shooting

280
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:10,079
To gauge how treatment varies among perpetrators

281
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:14,175
There factors like whether or not anyone was killed

282
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:15,711
What state it occurred in

283
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:18,783
A specific context of the shooting that you really need to take him to

284
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:20,831
Consideration if you want to compare TSA

285
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:22,111
The case be sure

286
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:27,999
I could do through a number of examples of people who engaged in school shootings who are white allowed bail

287
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:29,279
But does it really matter

288
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:32,095
Examples to Alex's claim here doesn't

289
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:34,143
Mean anything because Alex isn't even

290
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:35,679
Making this claim sincerely

291
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:36,703
He doesn't fit

292
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:39,263
Think it's a release because he's black

293
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:41,055
He would have been held if you were white

294
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:42,847
That's not a serious point

295
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:44,895
It's just signaling to the racist audience

296
00:15:45,151 --> 00:15:47,199
But he has created the perception of white oppression

297
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:48,479
To them to experience

298
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:49,503
Then get mad about

299
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:50,271
Yeah

300
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:51,039
I guess

301
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:52,063
Sia's

302
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:53,599
Why everyone's

303
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:55,391
Joining the euro

304
00:15:56,159 --> 00:16:01,279
It's just racism racism is certain except there's at this point

305
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:02,047
It's like

306
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:04,607
If this is the only nation where this

307
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:07,935
Type of thing regularly happens or happens at all

308
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:08,959
Then it take

309
00:16:09,215 --> 00:16:09,727
Complete struts

310
00:16:09,983 --> 00:16:10,495
Troll issue

311
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:13,823
You know so if you want to get into the lake

312
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:14,591
Weeds of

313
00:16:14,847 --> 00:16:16,639
Should the child be punished with

314
00:16:16,895 --> 00:16:20,479
10 years are tried as an adult that's fine but the reality is this is a

315
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:21,503
Complete struts

316
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:24,831
Before it's a personal responsibility

317
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:29,951
More to the issue that Alex is specifically bringing up though the

318
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:32,767
The qualifications of when someone

319
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:35,071
Would be allowed bail

320
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:36,607
After a shooting

321
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:38,143
It's a very

322
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:41,215
Number of circumstances

323
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:42,495
Exactly

324
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:44,799
I don't I don't find

325
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:46,591
Alex's Gates

326
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:48,383
This is just right

327
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:50,431
It's verifying your already held pressure

328
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:55,039
We get to talk in a little bit here about those

329
00:16:56,063 --> 00:16:57,343
But we talked about I think I'm the last

330
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:01,183
Alex a

331
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:01,951
Text example

332
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:05,279
Do use a word that he loves and that he's props

333
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:07,583
Atrocious

334
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:09,375
I see so good

335
00:17:10,399 --> 00:17:11,935
They want 75 years

336
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:18,079
I'm not joking

337
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:22,431
Emergency authorization

338
00:17:29,343 --> 00:17:29,855
Last week

339
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:30,879
Release

340
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:32,671
30 pages

341
00:17:34,207 --> 00:17:35,231
Thousands of dead

342
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:37,791
In just the first weeks of the rollout

343
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:39,583
Massive

344
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:43,935
Increases in

345
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:45,471
Spontaneous abortion

346
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:47,263
Play call a miscarriage now

347
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:49,567
Everything

348
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:56,479
We talked about the documents in detail on the last episode so I'm not going to go over all that but there are some other important points

349
00:17:56,735 --> 00:17:57,247
It's here

350
00:17:57,503 --> 00:17:59,807
The 75 years thing is just another predict

351
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:01,599
Should have when the documents would be fully released

352
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:02,879
The same rate

353
00:18:03,135 --> 00:18:04,671
Discuss the 500 pages a month

354
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:09,023
BMI just refuses to accept massive difference

355
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:12,095
Between the FDA reviewing the science and documents it receives

356
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:12,863
Privately

357
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:17,471
And the process required to then ethically and responsibly released those

358
00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:18,495
To the public

359
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:21,311
The first isn't in-house scientific analysis

360
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:25,919
And the other is a legal privacy-oriented analysis that obviously could take longer

361
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:31,551
The idea that they're pretending to not understand that a very obvious Dynamic is pretty clear everything

362
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:34,111
That's just

363
00:18:34,623 --> 00:18:36,415
Show me the argument is essentially

364
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:38,207
You should just turn over all of

365
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:41,791
These documents so we can harass people with all of this information

366
00:18:42,047 --> 00:18:48,191
Regardless of whether or not approves our point we will have names in personal information that we can f*** people up with

367
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:51,263
That and it's more efficient Expedition

368
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:52,031
4

369
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:55,871
Things we could be misrepresented as has already happened with his first

370
00:18:56,127 --> 00:18:56,639
Class

371
00:18:56,895 --> 00:19:00,735
Oh yeah this 3838 page document that Alex's

372
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:02,783
I turned it to the Smoking Gun

373
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:06,111
Yeah you're going to give them 300,000 pages so they can find

374
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:06,879
$0.03

375
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:10,207
Says to really Hammer home for the rest of our f****** live

376
00:19:11,231 --> 00:19:17,375
The second point I want to make is that the FDA did request that they narrow down their request so it wouldn't be 40

377
00:19:17,631 --> 00:19:18,911
Over 300,000.

378
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:20,959
Witcher timeline

379
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:24,799
Where's everyone to get the documents they want the lawyers could make sure they weren't releasing private

380
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:25,823
Information to the public

381
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:31,711
From everything I've read it seems like the fda's willing to prioritize whatever documents are most important

382
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:35,039
So ultimately if this group really wanted to reach the goal that therefore

383
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:36,063
Pretending they're looking

384
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:40,927
Collaborate with the FDA to get what they want

385
00:19:41,183 --> 00:19:41,951
Well before 7

386
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:42,719
35 years from now

387
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:43,487
Okay

388
00:19:44,511 --> 00:19:46,303
Stupid narrow down your foil request

389
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:49,119
We want the documents where you admit to killing everybody

390
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:50,911
I'm sorry those don't exist

391
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:54,239
Well obviously they both do you want everything

392
00:19:54,495 --> 00:19:59,615
Forever cover up

393
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:00,383
Okay

394
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:06,015
Third point I want to make is that Alex is claiming that now that the FDA has killed everyone they won't release

395
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:06,783
The documents

396
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:09,855
He immediately says that they did release the trash

397
00:20:10,111 --> 00:20:11,903
That includes what he's pretending as evidence

398
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:13,183
Thousands of vaccine

399
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:15,231
That's completely self

400
00:20:15,487 --> 00:20:16,511
Contradictory of the position

401
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:23,167
They refused to release the documents but also they released this document that's the Smoking Gun

402
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:27,007
Bring Me The Smoking Gun of what they've done

403
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:30,335
Finally I want to clarify with Alex's lying about as a relates

404
00:20:30,591 --> 00:20:31,615
Spontaneous abortion

405
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:34,431
There were 413 reports

406
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:36,991
Involving persons in the data set that they had

407
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:37,759
And of these

408
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:39,295
He's twenty-three were reporting

409
00:20:39,551 --> 00:20:40,575
Spontaneous abortion

410
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:44,927
And five additional instances of different variations of spontaneous abortions like

411
00:20:45,183 --> 00:20:47,487
Ones with neonatal death or intrauterine

412
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:51,327
Worst case scenario from these numbers as if they were 28

413
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:52,095
Agencies that ended

414
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:53,119
Spontaneous abortion

415
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:54,143
Some people who were vacs

416
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:57,215
This cannot prove that the spontaneous

417
00:20:57,727 --> 00:20:58,495
Were caused by the vaccine

418
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:00,799
So what's up for now

419
00:21:01,055 --> 00:21:02,847
And talk about what we can tell from this number

420
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:04,895
This would constitute approximately

421
00:21:05,151 --> 00:21:06,431
At least 7% of the break-in

422
00:21:06,687 --> 00:21:08,991
She's captured the data ending in spontaneous abortion

423
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:14,367
This number sounds really high out of context but you need to know what the rate of spontaneous abortion isn't

424
00:21:14,623 --> 00:21:15,647
The general population

425
00:21:15,903 --> 00:21:20,768
If you want to get any kind of sense about whether this is within or outside the range of what you would expect

426
00:21:21,024 --> 00:21:23,584
In this number of people with or without the vaccine

427
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:25,376
According to the Mayo Clinic

428
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:29,216
A quote about 10 to 20% of known pregnancies end in miscarriage

429
00:21:29,728 --> 00:21:34,592
But the actual number is likely higher because many miscarriages occur very early in pregnancy

430
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:36,896
Before you might even know about a

431
00:21:37,152 --> 00:21:37,664
You might think

432
00:21:38,432 --> 00:21:39,200
Having a heavy.

433
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:40,992
Possible

434
00:21:41,504 --> 00:21:44,832
The numbers captured in the FDA Adverse Events report actually reflect

435
00:21:45,088 --> 00:21:46,112
Text a much lower than

436
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:46,880
Unexpected rate

437
00:21:47,136 --> 00:21:48,160
Spontaneous abortion

438
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:48,928
Then you would expect

439
00:21:49,184 --> 00:21:50,208
Courtesy of the general population

440
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:52,256
That's probably a function of

441
00:21:52,512 --> 00:21:53,280
Incomplete information

442
00:21:53,536 --> 00:21:54,304
Then the report about pregnant

443
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,072
The outcomes

444
00:21:55,328 --> 00:21:59,936
You have really no reason to suspect that the vaccine that any discernible outcome

445
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:01,216
In terms of miscarriage

446
00:22:01,984 --> 00:22:03,520
That's why this report concludes

447
00:22:03,776 --> 00:22:04,288
Quote

448
00:22:04,544 --> 00:22:08,128
There were no safety signals that emerged from the review of these cases

449
00:22:08,384 --> 00:22:09,920
Of use and pregnancy and well

450
00:22:10,176 --> 00:22:10,688
Breastfeed

451
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,480
What a great things are right

452
00:22:12,736 --> 00:22:14,784
If you're covering up the truth

453
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:21,184
Alex can take this number of reported spontaneous abortions about 7% and that's a lot if you expect that the number should be

454
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:22,976
0 but that's not reality

455
00:22:23,488 --> 00:22:25,280
He's creating a false problem bike

456
00:22:25,536 --> 00:22:27,072
Comparing these numbers to the wrong

457
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:27,840
Baseline

458
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:29,632
And that's because he's dumb and

459
00:22:30,144 --> 00:22:32,192
Anyway that's what's going on here what he yells about

460
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:34,240
A bunch of

461
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,544
Spontaneous abortion

462
00:22:37,568 --> 00:22:38,080
Sidetracks

463
00:22:38,592 --> 00:22:41,664
Wow 7% is lower by

464
00:22:42,432 --> 00:22:48,320
Send the estimated 3% lower than the low range excited by the Mayo Clinic

465
00:22:49,088 --> 00:22:53,440
It's almost like we should probably know that off hand but because it's

466
00:22:53,696 --> 00:22:54,208
It's about women

467
00:22:54,464 --> 00:22:55,232
Society

468
00:22:55,488 --> 00:22:56,768
Large doesn't care that

469
00:23:01,888 --> 00:23:04,960
More dangers and difficulties

470
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:07,008
Is a pregnancy then then a lot of people wreck

471
00:23:07,264 --> 00:23:12,896
Goodnight seem like that should be so obvious though if it is 10 to 20% Which obviously it is

472
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:16,224
How is it that that is not so well

473
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:20,064
No do you know what I mean like that's a significantly higher amount

474
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:24,160
For the number of people who would exist for which is just about every f******

475
00:23:24,672 --> 00:23:25,184
You know

476
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:25,952
It's weird

477
00:23:26,464 --> 00:23:28,768
Yeah yeah it definitely the beat the fact

478
00:23:29,024 --> 00:23:34,400
The people don't know it is a handy tool for someone like Alex to be able to misrepresent the data activist

479
00:23:35,424 --> 00:23:35,936
So we have to

480
00:23:37,472 --> 00:23:41,824
Haha. The vaccine still going

481
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:45,408
Pfizer covid vaccine

482
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:46,944
Pulling off the market

483
00:23:47,712 --> 00:23:49,248
Wowed

484
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,296
So I'm sure

485
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:53,088
Open Twitter

486
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:53,856
In fact they are

487
00:23:54,368 --> 00:23:59,744
I can find a few articles that discuss the Japanese Health Ministry deciding to put a warning on the visor in vagina vaccine

488
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:00,768
That

489
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:02,304
I could have possible serious item

490
00:24:03,072 --> 00:24:04,096
That's their prerogative

491
00:24:04,608 --> 00:24:07,168
I can find no evidence that they're contemplating taking it off

492
00:24:07,424 --> 00:24:10,240
Market over this though and I strongly suspect

493
00:24:10,752 --> 00:24:11,264
Like that

494
00:24:11,776 --> 00:24:17,920
An article in the Japan times does discuss how the health Ministry may decide to recommend a Pfizer vaccine over the moderna wanted

495
00:24:18,176 --> 00:24:19,968
Because it appears that the possible risk

496
00:24:20,224 --> 00:24:20,736
Is lower

497
00:24:21,248 --> 00:24:21,760
With visor

498
00:24:22,016 --> 00:24:24,064
But even so the rates of myocarditis

499
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,856
Some people who get covid

500
00:24:26,112 --> 00:24:26,880
Substantially higher

501
00:24:27,392 --> 00:24:28,416
But even the worst numbers

502
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:29,440
You can find for the vaccine

503
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:31,232
That article cites

504
00:24:31,488 --> 00:24:33,536
Tetsuo Nakayama the project

505
00:24:33,792 --> 00:24:36,352
Professor at the

506
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:41,216
Attitude for life sciences and the director of the Japanese Society of cultural virologia

507
00:24:41,472 --> 00:24:45,824
The risk of myocarditis is much lower and people who got them the vaccine than those

508
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,872
I experiencing a natural infection

509
00:24:48,384 --> 00:24:49,408
So there is no reason

510
00:24:49,664 --> 00:24:50,176
To Halt its use

511
00:24:50,944 --> 00:24:54,016
That's got to be the vibe that coming out of the story

512
00:24:54,528 --> 00:24:56,832
Given a warning of the potential

513
00:24:57,088 --> 00:24:58,368
Side effects

514
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,952
Delineator lesbian causally linked but

515
00:25:02,464 --> 00:25:03,488
What was Japan

516
00:25:04,768 --> 00:25:05,536
So

517
00:25:06,048 --> 00:25:06,560
Get out

518
00:25:07,328 --> 00:25:13,216
You can't say well oh it's not the UN so they're going to censor its like you been part of the us but it's not coming from like the

519
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:16,544
The un's had the body or whatever the World Health

520
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:19,360
Translation

521
00:25:19,872 --> 00:25:23,712
So we got also some news out of Israel

522
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,808
Israel says at least 7 boosters

523
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,368
Haha

524
00:25:31,136 --> 00:25:33,952
Oh my God I told you it'll be 10 shots a year

525
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:39,328
Elder said

526
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,120
This is the best business ever

527
00:25:41,632 --> 00:25:43,680
Song when I do

528
00:25:44,192 --> 00:25:44,704
And

529
00:26:05,952 --> 00:26:07,744
First of all that Bill Gates Prospect

530
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:08,512
Cuz doesn't exist

531
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:09,792
Alex is just making that up

532
00:26:10,304 --> 00:26:12,096
And if he's not I would say that he's committing journalist

533
00:26:12,352 --> 00:26:13,632
Malpractice by not releasing

534
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:18,496
Absolutely not real so I was just committing journalistic malpractice by bang that s*** up

535
00:26:19,008 --> 00:26:24,896
I just started laughing while talking about that because on some level he can't believe that he can get away with this level of b*******

536
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:29,760
As for the seven boosters think that's misreporting on Alex's part as well

537
00:26:30,272 --> 00:26:32,832
There was a Times of Israel article that Paul Joseph Watson

538
00:26:33,088 --> 00:26:35,904
I'm covered poorly and now Alex's covering Paul schuette work

539
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,184
Even more sloppily

540
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:41,280
The actual article is about the health Minister and it's on Horowitz

541
00:26:41,536 --> 00:26:43,328
Discussing the possibility of a fourth dose

542
00:26:43,584 --> 00:26:44,096
In the country

543
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:45,120
Which would be the second

544
00:26:46,144 --> 00:26:51,776
However he says quote I don't know yet if we see that the vaccine's efficacy drops after a certain amount of time

545
00:26:52,032 --> 00:26:54,848
Even after the booster we could wrap a recommended fourth dose

546
00:26:55,104 --> 00:26:55,616
It's possible

547
00:26:56,384 --> 00:26:58,432
That's what the health minister is

548
00:26:58,688 --> 00:26:59,200
Once again

549
00:26:59,456 --> 00:27:01,248
Measured

550
00:27:01,504 --> 00:27:02,272
Obvious response

551
00:27:02,528 --> 00:27:03,808
If bad

552
00:27:04,064 --> 00:27:04,576
Then yes

553
00:27:05,088 --> 00:27:07,648
The article also has a comment from Professor are known as

554
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:12,768
The deputy director of the Sheba Medical Center who is of the belief that the second booster was

555
00:27:13,024 --> 00:27:13,536
Inevitable

556
00:27:14,048 --> 00:27:17,632
Whoever thinks that we won't have a fourth doses simply mistaken

557
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:19,424
Isaac told the Wynette

558
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,448
News

559
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:26,848
As long as there's still a pandemic and areas like Africa which have low vaccination rates there will be more and more variants

560
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,640
Eric said he hopes that sucks

561
00:27:28,896 --> 00:27:31,968
Covid mutations won't be as contagious and severe as the Delta variant

562
00:27:32,224 --> 00:27:32,992
Quote but it

563
00:27:33,248 --> 00:27:33,760
It seems

564
00:27:34,016 --> 00:27:34,528
That we will need

565
00:27:34,784 --> 00:27:35,808
Need to take a fourth and fifth

566
00:27:36,064 --> 00:27:37,344
In 6th and 7th dose

567
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,368
Who knows how many

568
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,160
So that's where this quote is coming

569
00:27:40,416 --> 00:27:46,560
Any coverage of the story Alex's misidentifying the source of the comment and he's also mischaracterizing what was

570
00:27:46,816 --> 00:27:47,328
Set

571
00:27:47,584 --> 00:27:53,472
If you just listen to Alex you would think that a health official was saying that you needed at least 7 boosters to be considered fully vaccinated

572
00:27:53,728 --> 00:27:54,496
Would you be 9 shot

573
00:27:55,008 --> 00:27:58,080
That's absolutely not what this article says and once again

574
00:27:58,336 --> 00:28:02,176
I'd like to remind Tucker that Alex is a shity guide to reality

575
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:03,712
Nonsense

576
00:28:04,736 --> 00:28:05,248
Dumb

577
00:28:05,504 --> 00:28:06,016
S***

578
00:28:06,784 --> 00:28:07,296
Yeah

579
00:28:07,552 --> 00:28:08,320
I mean what else

580
00:28:08,576 --> 00:28:14,464
What do you expect a f****** expert to say about this is just literally like this is how shots work

581
00:28:14,976 --> 00:28:18,560
We're in a pandemic if you don't want to be in a pandemic than guess what this

582
00:28:18,816 --> 00:28:19,840
This is how it works

583
00:28:20,096 --> 00:28:20,608
It's not like

584
00:28:20,864 --> 00:28:22,144
OSB Legos

585
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:25,472
We're making it work like this this is how we have to

586
00:28:25,728 --> 00:28:26,240
To respond

587
00:28:26,752 --> 00:28:27,520
Because of you dick

588
00:28:27,776 --> 00:28:29,824
Funny about this professor just saying

589
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,104
Is that is of his

590
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,384
But

591
00:28:34,688 --> 00:28:35,200
We could be looking

592
00:28:35,712 --> 00:28:38,528
Sure that is not somebody dictated government policy

593
00:28:38,784 --> 00:28:41,600
Thing we definitely need seven shots and that's how it is

594
00:28:41,856 --> 00:28:45,440
Is reporting this I mean imagine imagine if this happens like

595
00:28:45,952 --> 00:28:49,024
However many years ago in somebody's like listen we're going to have

596
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:50,816
We're going to have a yearly flu shot

597
00:28:51,072 --> 00:28:51,840
I put your face it

598
00:28:52,096 --> 00:28:55,680
The flu is going to mutate every single f****** time we try and stop it

599
00:28:55,936 --> 00:28:59,776
So we're going to have yearly flu shots how would Alex have covered the moment that was in

600
00:29:00,032 --> 00:29:00,544
Introduce

601
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:01,568
I'm certain

602
00:29:01,824 --> 00:29:07,968
That there were people who acted like Alex Becker

603
00:29:08,224 --> 00:29:10,016
However many years later and everybody's fine

604
00:29:10,784 --> 00:29:14,368
But it's going to happen every single time there's a new disease that we create

605
00:29:14,624 --> 00:29:15,648
Entered into a f******

606
00:29:15,904 --> 00:29:17,184
God I hate everybody

607
00:29:18,976 --> 00:29:22,560
Do you should do also know if you hate everybody you should hate

608
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:26,400
Because they're talking about preemptively nuking

609
00:29:26,656 --> 00:29:31,008
Russia I don't know if you knew that

610
00:29:33,568 --> 00:29:35,872
Pisanello's look war with Russia

611
00:29:39,968 --> 00:29:40,480
Oh

612
00:29:40,992 --> 00:29:41,760
A grand collapse

613
00:29:45,856 --> 00:29:47,648
Crisis

614
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,536
Possibly can

615
00:29:57,888 --> 00:29:58,656
Destroy

616
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,752
Almost past the point of return

617
00:30:03,264 --> 00:30:05,568
World leaders aren't talking about nuke in Russia

618
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:09,408
I did was just a comment that Republican senator Rodger wicker said on Fox

619
00:30:09,664 --> 00:30:10,176
Fox News

620
00:30:10,432 --> 00:30:14,272
Discussing the situation in Ukraine and how Biden should respond he said quote

621
00:30:14,784 --> 00:30:16,320
I would not rule out Military at

622
00:30:16,832 --> 00:30:21,184
Military action could mean we stand off with our ships in the Black Sea Andre rain.

623
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,720
Obstruction on Russian

624
00:30:22,976 --> 00:30:24,000
Military capability

625
00:30:24,512 --> 00:30:25,792
I would not rule out America

626
00:30:26,048 --> 00:30:26,816
Troops on the ground

627
00:30:27,328 --> 00:30:29,120
You know we don't rule out the first

628
00:30:29,376 --> 00:30:30,144
Use nuclear Act

629
00:30:30,656 --> 00:30:31,424
We don't think it'll happen

630
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:32,192
But

631
00:30:32,704 --> 00:30:36,288
For no reason whatsoever I want to read to you from an email that Rodger wicker sent to his

632
00:30:36,544 --> 00:30:39,360
Constituents in Mississippi 3 days after the 2020 election

633
00:30:39,872 --> 00:30:40,384
Quote

634
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:46,784
President Trump's team reached out to me about the voting fraud that's going on in our country right now there is no

635
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:48,064
Capital n o

636
00:30:49,088 --> 00:30:50,112
Excuse for any of this

637
00:30:50,624 --> 00:30:54,976
Americans should be confident that their ballot was submitted directly legally in untampered

638
00:30:55,744 --> 00:31:00,352
You don't vote to certify the election that's great but not before he played his role and whipping up

639
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:02,656
The distrust and paranoia that led to January

640
00:31:04,704 --> 00:31:09,312
First of all wicker is not what you would call a world-leader he was just talking s*** on Fox News

641
00:31:09,568 --> 00:31:10,592
Second diesel truck guy

642
00:31:11,104 --> 00:31:12,128
About 22 report

643
00:31:12,384 --> 00:31:13,408
The story accurately he would

644
00:31:13,664 --> 00:31:15,712
Be saying that one of the senators of Kik

645
00:31:16,736 --> 00:31:17,760
Ring now wants Biden

646
00:31:18,016 --> 00:31:19,040
Pitkin Center attack

647
00:31:19,808 --> 00:31:20,320
That's more accurate

648
00:31:20,832 --> 00:31:22,368
I mean it would be

649
00:31:22,624 --> 00:31:28,768
Very similar to him saying something like remember how pissed off I was whenever Trump drop that bomb in Syria

650
00:31:29,024 --> 00:31:35,168
I cried and said he can go f*** himself forever and all of that stuff Isis apart dirty assholes

651
00:31:35,424 --> 00:31:41,568
You did say that or his dirty a****** account number is saying we should do this

652
00:31:41,824 --> 00:31:44,896
Same thing to Russia so I am also angry inside of it

653
00:31:46,432 --> 00:31:52,576
It's world leaders Rodger wicker is a globalist except when he sent out an email trying to help Trump find voter fraud

654
00:31:52,832 --> 00:31:54,624
Music by name you can use them both white alright

655
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,928
And later Alico call him Rodger Whittaker

656
00:31:57,184 --> 00:32:00,512
I've no idea who the people even are

657
00:32:00,768 --> 00:32:02,304
What's good to know that we're almost

658
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:06,912
Past the point of return now as opposed to a few weeks ago when it was already too late to stop what was coming

659
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:10,752
Sympathetically transparent that Alex's mood is the only real determined

660
00:32:11,008 --> 00:32:13,056
Exactly whether or not it's too late to do something

661
00:32:13,312 --> 00:32:14,336
Stop the globalists plan

662
00:32:15,104 --> 00:32:17,664
Really hard to imagine that his audience hasn't caught on to that by now like

663
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:19,200
How do you not ask yourself why he

664
00:32:19,456 --> 00:32:20,480
He keeps going back and forth

665
00:32:20,736 --> 00:32:25,344
On whether or not it's too late to stop the end of the world

666
00:32:26,368 --> 00:32:27,136
Except our death

667
00:32:27,392 --> 00:32:33,536
Or do we fight or do we fight mix up their deaths or do we not accept our deaths in then fight

668
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:36,352
Because

669
00:32:36,608 --> 00:32:38,144
It might be somewhere in the middle

670
00:32:38,912 --> 00:32:39,680
All I can tell you

671
00:32:41,216 --> 00:32:42,496
The answer is going to be

672
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:45,312
Going and getting very conservative Christian communities

673
00:32:45,824 --> 00:32:46,848
In the middle of nowhere work

674
00:32:47,104 --> 00:32:48,896
People just very austere

675
00:32:51,968 --> 00:32:54,272
Because once all this Falls once all this goes

676
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,112
And

677
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,672
Tried to stop this and we had a chance to back

678
00:33:03,232 --> 00:33:04,512
When you look at

679
00:33:04,768 --> 00:33:06,304
Klaus Schwab

680
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:07,584
These are psychos

681
00:33:08,096 --> 00:33:11,680
So I have terrible news for Alex what the plan is I took it up about setting up like

682
00:33:12,192 --> 00:33:13,216
Christian cities

683
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,008
Complete violation of

684
00:33:15,264 --> 00:33:16,544
Well there's that

685
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:18,336
Particular The Establishment Clause

686
00:33:18,592 --> 00:33:23,968
Sure I guess if you wanted to just have a weird compound in the middle of the woods or pull of Jim Bakker that would be

687
00:33:24,224 --> 00:33:26,528
Define

688
00:33:26,784 --> 00:33:29,344
Structure like incorporate as an actual City

689
00:33:30,112 --> 00:33:31,136
The First Amendment rules about the

690
00:33:31,392 --> 00:33:34,464
State not being involved in the establishment of any religion replies

691
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,256
Who plays not just the Federal

692
00:33:36,768 --> 00:33:37,792
But the lower governments as well

693
00:33:38,304 --> 00:33:41,632
What you're discussing the need to create religiously-based communities

694
00:33:41,888 --> 00:33:43,936
You pretty much have given up any right to care about the cost

695
00:33:44,192 --> 00:33:44,960
Restitution ever again

696
00:33:45,472 --> 00:33:47,008
He wants to

697
00:33:47,264 --> 00:33:49,056
He loves guns

698
00:33:49,568 --> 00:33:51,872
It's tough to respect those arguments being based in a reverend

699
00:33:52,128 --> 00:33:53,408
For the Constitution to Caesar

700
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:55,200
His solutions to problem

701
00:33:55,712 --> 00:33:59,296
Yeah aren't they aren't there like militia cities in

702
00:33:59,552 --> 00:34:03,136
In Idaho but even they in there like Charter not cities

703
00:34:03,392 --> 00:34:04,928
Even they can't like

704
00:34:05,184 --> 00:34:09,024
Incorporate as a City Christian City you cannot

705
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:12,864
Not do that yeah it is a

706
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:13,632
Christian City

707
00:34:13,888 --> 00:34:17,728
Or something is just like

708
00:34:17,984 --> 00:34:18,496
Campus

709
00:34:18,752 --> 00:34:20,544
They have to refer to themselves as a camper

710
00:34:21,056 --> 00:34:21,568
It has like a

711
00:34:21,824 --> 00:34:22,592
The hospital

712
00:34:22,848 --> 00:34:24,128
And

713
00:34:24,384 --> 00:34:25,408
Text money from the government

714
00:34:25,664 --> 00:34:29,248
If your incorporated as a city that won't work

715
00:34:29,504 --> 00:34:34,112
But maybe that's not what he wants anyway baby does just want to have like a compound

716
00:34:34,624 --> 00:34:35,904
That's healthy

717
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:40,512
Yeah that's great. Everybody in history whose wanted a compound has been a good

718
00:34:40,768 --> 00:34:41,280
Person

719
00:34:41,536 --> 00:34:42,816
And it's usually worked

720
00:34:43,328 --> 00:34:43,840
Yeah

721
00:34:44,864 --> 00:34:47,936
You know what specially especially people have compounds where it's like

722
00:34:48,192 --> 00:34:51,264
Alright the premise of this compound is that the rest of the world is f*****

723
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:53,568
This is the only place we're safe

724
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:55,104
So also there's a fun fact

725
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:58,432
I was just talking about like a class lobbying

726
00:35:00,224 --> 00:35:01,504
You do class Schwab is

727
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:03,808
Like a relevant figures for a lot of hits

728
00:35:05,344 --> 00:35:08,672
Is created the world economic forum

729
00:35:08,928 --> 00:35:13,536
I can find no evidence that Infowars ever posted an article containing the name Klaus Schwab

730
00:35:13,792 --> 00:35:14,816
Until November 6th

731
00:35:15,072 --> 00:35:21,216
Jeep 2020 that's not good for somebody who's been right about everything to not even know

732
00:35:21,472 --> 00:35:23,776
The major player in his

733
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:30,432
Extinction game

734
00:35:30,688 --> 00:35:31,200
Pop up

735
00:35:31,456 --> 00:35:36,832
If you write about everything 20 years later if I didn't even know the name of the guy that's kind of

736
00:35:37,088 --> 00:35:38,112
Yeah yeah yeah

737
00:35:39,648 --> 00:35:40,160
Suspicious

738
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:43,488
Blofeld who is

739
00:35:43,744 --> 00:35:47,840
Hiding himself from everything even made the world economic forum

740
00:35:48,096 --> 00:35:48,608
Stroke

741
00:35:48,864 --> 00:35:49,632
So Alex

742
00:35:49,888 --> 00:35:51,936
You know whenever he brags he likes

743
00:35:52,192 --> 00:35:52,960
Society's not bragging

744
00:35:53,216 --> 00:35:55,008
Here's an instance of him not bragging

745
00:35:55,264 --> 00:35:56,544
About how he's woken up

746
00:35:57,056 --> 00:35:57,568
Really important

747
00:35:57,824 --> 00:35:58,336
People.

748
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,504
I say this so you have somehow

749
00:36:06,272 --> 00:36:07,808
Brag

750
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:11,392
Acrostico deposit

751
00:36:12,928 --> 00:36:14,720
We have come so far together

752
00:36:15,232 --> 00:36:15,744
In this fight

753
00:36:21,376 --> 00:36:21,888
The guest

754
00:36:22,144 --> 00:36:23,936
The collars

755
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:28,032
Probably because

756
00:36:28,288 --> 00:36:29,056
This is our culture

757
00:36:29,568 --> 00:36:30,336
This is Who We Are

758
00:36:31,616 --> 00:36:34,176
All alone

759
00:36:34,688 --> 00:36:35,712
They want to cut off from each other

760
00:36:36,992 --> 00:36:38,272
Do you know that

761
00:36:43,392 --> 00:36:45,952
List of everybody fighting New World Order

762
00:36:46,976 --> 00:36:48,256
By the day

763
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:52,096
Almost every one of them personally told me that

764
00:36:53,376 --> 00:36:54,144
Them up

765
00:36:54,656 --> 00:36:57,984
And they wouldn't be awake or understood this and if I had been there

766
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:00,288
But I thought it was crazy 20-something years ago

767
00:37:02,848 --> 00:37:04,384
From

768
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:08,480
Other surrounding contacts he's talking about Tucker Carlson and Clyde back

769
00:37:08,736 --> 00:37:13,600
I totally not bragging what are you bragging about how those dude say he woke them up if that's great I mean

770
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:18,208
Tucker is a shity opportunist who found ridiculous ratings lean and hard at the trumpet

771
00:37:18,464 --> 00:37:18,976
Extremism

772
00:37:19,232 --> 00:37:21,280
He's just following that thread out as far as he can

773
00:37:21,792 --> 00:37:23,072
Hey Susie needs to get it

774
00:37:23,328 --> 00:37:24,608
Self-preservation mode

775
00:37:24,864 --> 00:37:28,192
Seriously end up finding someone else to wake him up to something else

776
00:37:28,448 --> 00:37:30,240
Like maybe helping him ReDiscover his meal

777
00:37:30,496 --> 00:37:31,008
Conservative route

778
00:37:31,264 --> 00:37:31,776
Right

779
00:37:32,032 --> 00:37:34,592
As we're going back this is really just more of a desperation

780
00:37:34,848 --> 00:37:35,360
Something

781
00:37:35,616 --> 00:37:36,384
Legitimately

782
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:39,712
Nobody respects Glenn back anymore and he's got no place in the market

783
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:40,992
He's laughable

784
00:37:41,248 --> 00:37:43,808
Sirius media and he's been way too weak for the extremist

785
00:37:44,064 --> 00:37:46,112
Immediate

786
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,160
He's got the blaze Network

787
00:37:48,672 --> 00:37:54,304
Reruns and I'm sure he does fine with that but he's not even the most relevant host on his very depressing Network

788
00:37:55,072 --> 00:37:59,936
He's way less popular than Steven Crowder it probably even less popular than Dave Rubin

789
00:38:00,192 --> 00:38:03,264
And I would guess that he probably has less of an audience than Gavin

790
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:04,288
McGinnis did but

791
00:38:04,544 --> 00:38:09,408
The fire Gavin back in 2018 when he merged with Mark Levin conservative media platform

792
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:10,944
So cool

793
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:13,248
Really really into free speech

794
00:38:14,784 --> 00:38:18,624
We woke up a lot of very important people this year in my head I was like yeah yeah

795
00:38:19,136 --> 00:38:19,648
Zach

796
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:20,928
Kelly

797
00:38:21,184 --> 00:38:21,952
Lisa

798
00:38:22,208 --> 00:38:22,720
Slater

799
00:38:23,232 --> 00:38:23,744
Screech

800
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,048
Why am I thinking of Saved by the Bell

801
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:29,376
The Millman he's like we woke up a lot of people I'm like

802
00:38:29,632 --> 00:38:30,656
I got the whole cast

803
00:38:30,912 --> 00:38:36,544
To say by the Bell. Everybody I'm confused why you were thinking that

804
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:37,824
I don't know

805
00:38:39,104 --> 00:38:42,432
It's interesting that Alex is so proud of Heaven waking up these

806
00:38:42,688 --> 00:38:44,480
Clearly disingenuous media figure

807
00:38:44,736 --> 00:38:46,784
Other people he's woken up

808
00:38:47,296 --> 00:38:48,576
Like Daniel Rodriguez

809
00:38:48,832 --> 00:38:54,208
The guy was arrested for tasing officer Mike fanone during the storming of the Capitol on January

810
00:38:54,976 --> 00:38:57,536
The FBI released a transcript of an interview with him

811
00:38:57,792 --> 00:38:59,840
I'm in the conversation he's asked about how

812
00:39:00,096 --> 00:39:01,632
No prior to January 6th

813
00:39:01,888 --> 00:39:04,192
Keep in the back of the blue rally and he stood up for

814
00:39:04,448 --> 00:39:05,984
The cops then on the 6th

815
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:07,776
There he was assaulting a cop

816
00:39:08,544 --> 00:39:11,104
The agent who's doing the interviews asked me what what'd happen

817
00:39:11,872 --> 00:39:16,992
So how did the Danny that stood on the line in between law enforcement and antifa and BLM

818
00:39:17,248 --> 00:39:18,528
How did you get to that point

819
00:39:18,784 --> 00:39:21,088
What happened in your life like how did you start going

820
00:39:21,344 --> 00:39:21,856
These rallies

821
00:39:22,624 --> 00:39:23,392
Daddy responds

822
00:39:23,904 --> 00:39:24,416
Infowars

823
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:27,488
Infowars so like Alex Jones stuff

824
00:39:27,744 --> 00:39:29,024
David replies

825
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,048
Send Danny.

826
00:39:30,816 --> 00:39:34,400
Later in the interview Danny says cook I've been following Infowars for

827
00:39:34,912 --> 00:39:36,960
2008-2009 Maybe

828
00:39:37,216 --> 00:39:37,728
He's the one

829
00:39:37,984 --> 00:39:41,312
Alex Jones Infowars out there you know

830
00:39:41,568 --> 00:39:45,920
That there's an other news that's not on TV but they don't want you to know you know

831
00:39:46,432 --> 00:39:47,968
They don't tell you a lot of things

832
00:39:48,736 --> 00:39:51,296
That was just information is is what it is

833
00:39:51,808 --> 00:39:53,600
I was trying to find the truth and answers

834
00:39:53,856 --> 00:39:55,904
And what I thought I found the truth and answers

835
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:58,720
I thought it was up to me to I don't know I just

836
00:39:58,976 --> 00:40:00,000
It's like when like

837
00:40:00,256 --> 00:40:01,024
There's a saying like

838
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:02,304
To know better is

839
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:03,072
Knowing better

840
00:40:03,328 --> 00:40:05,376
To know better is to do better you know

841
00:40:06,144 --> 00:40:07,168
Because they really are

842
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:08,704
You're killing Trump supporter

843
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:10,752
Shooting them in the head

844
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:12,800
School in public everything right

845
00:40:13,312 --> 00:40:14,848
So I kept thinking that we were going

846
00:40:15,104 --> 00:40:16,384
Go to like a civil war

847
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:18,176
Kohat

848
00:40:18,432 --> 00:40:19,712
It's going to go you know

849
00:40:19,968 --> 00:40:20,736
I don't know

850
00:40:20,992 --> 00:40:23,040
I don't know we didn't nobody knew

851
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:27,136
So we just thought it was going to we're preparing for the little prepared to save the country

852
00:40:27,392 --> 00:40:28,672
We thought we were saving the country

853
00:40:29,184 --> 00:40:30,720
I thought I was going to help save the country

854
00:40:31,744 --> 00:40:32,512
Decided

855
00:40:32,768 --> 00:40:35,328
Consider himself a three percenter also which is something that he

856
00:40:35,584 --> 00:40:37,888
He told the agents that he had learned about from Infowars

857
00:40:38,912 --> 00:40:39,680
In the interview

858
00:40:39,936 --> 00:40:43,264
Danny tries to downplay his desire to do violent s*** at the Capitol

859
00:40:44,544 --> 00:40:47,872
But unfortunately the end of November he got hit with some new charges involving

860
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:50,176
Conspiracy to commit violence

861
00:40:50,688 --> 00:40:52,480
It turns out he was on a telegram Channel

862
00:40:52,736 --> 00:40:55,552
That he and his friends created titled Patriots 45

863
00:40:55,808 --> 00:40:58,880
Where he at these friends wrote fairly openly about their vile

864
00:40:59,136 --> 00:40:59,648
What plans

865
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:01,696
One of his buddies wrote quote

866
00:41:01,952 --> 00:41:05,024
We need to violently remove Traders and if they're in key position

867
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:07,072
Replace them with able-bodied

868
00:41:07,328 --> 00:41:07,840
Patriots

869
00:41:08,608 --> 00:41:11,424
Danny wrote about a week before January 6th

870
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:12,704
Congress can hang

871
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:13,472
I'll do it

872
00:41:13,728 --> 00:41:14,752
Please let us get the

873
00:41:15,008 --> 00:41:16,032
These people Dear God

874
00:41:16,544 --> 00:41:22,432
The person who wasn't named in the indictment but whose identity is known to the grand jury that he would assassinate Joe Biden

875
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:23,200
If you got the chance

876
00:41:23,968 --> 00:41:27,040
On January 5th Danny posted in the group quote

877
00:41:27,296 --> 00:41:29,344
There Will Be Blood welcome to the revolution

878
00:41:30,368 --> 00:41:32,160
The indictment alleges that in preparation

879
00:41:32,416 --> 00:41:34,976
For the 6 the group began quote collecting weapons and

880
00:41:35,232 --> 00:41:37,792
Cycle Gear to bring to Washington DC including a taser

881
00:41:38,048 --> 00:41:40,096
Pepper spray baseball bat gas masks

882
00:41:40,608 --> 00:41:41,120
And walkie-talkie

883
00:41:42,144 --> 00:41:43,424
In contrast

884
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:46,496
I'm confused you appeared in the FBI interview

885
00:41:47,008 --> 00:41:49,312
Immediately after leaving the capital Danny message

886
00:41:49,568 --> 00:41:54,175
Does group chat and said quote OMG I did so much f****** s*** right now and got away

887
00:41:54,687 --> 00:41:55,199
Tell you later

888
00:41:55,711 --> 00:41:58,527
Tazed with a bunch of Z's the f*** out of the blue

889
00:41:58,783 --> 00:42:00,575
Wow wow

890
00:42:01,087 --> 00:42:01,599
Fun

891
00:42:02,111 --> 00:42:06,207
Interesting Lee we also learn for the indictment on January 8th one of Danity

892
00:42:06,463 --> 00:42:08,511
He's co-conspirators guy named Edward balidan

893
00:42:08,767 --> 00:42:09,279
I called

894
00:42:09,535 --> 00:42:12,863
Owen Shroyer show and field in fours in on what they've done

895
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:16,959
Haley blamed the violence on Trump supporters that they had just decided where

896
00:42:17,471 --> 00:42:19,519
Antifa

897
00:42:19,775 --> 00:42:20,287
Yeah

898
00:42:20,799 --> 00:42:24,127
Tucker and Glen Becker shameless.con men telling Alex what he wants

899
00:42:24,383 --> 00:42:26,175
Insecure cuz it suits the current state of their grid

900
00:42:26,943 --> 00:42:30,527
They don't even know what Alex is actually promoting or preaching over the years

901
00:42:31,039 --> 00:42:32,063
Popular in the world

902
00:42:33,087 --> 00:42:34,111
Why isn't as a point

903
00:42:34,367 --> 00:42:34,879
At this time

904
00:42:35,135 --> 00:42:35,647
Like at this moment

905
00:42:35,903 --> 00:42:38,463
That's popular in their grip

906
00:42:38,719 --> 00:42:39,487
Pretend

907
00:42:39,743 --> 00:42:40,767
Cast aside the moment.

908
00:42:41,023 --> 00:42:41,791
Convenient

909
00:42:42,047 --> 00:42:45,631
People like Danny Rodriguez real people Alex wakes up

910
00:42:45,887 --> 00:42:47,423
They get sucked in by Alex physics

911
00:42:47,679 --> 00:42:49,471
Stream and very immediate rhetoric

912
00:42:49,727 --> 00:42:52,543
And they reach the natural conclusion of what Alex presents

913
00:42:53,055 --> 00:42:54,335
There demons in the White House

914
00:42:54,591 --> 00:42:55,359
Trump won the election

915
00:42:55,871 --> 00:42:56,639
The demon stole it

916
00:42:56,895 --> 00:42:59,199
The only way to save the country has come to DC in flight

917
00:43:00,223 --> 00:43:01,247
They lash out

918
00:43:01,503 --> 00:43:02,271
And brag to their friends

919
00:43:02,527 --> 00:43:03,295
It's about how they tasered

920
00:43:03,551 --> 00:43:04,831
The cop when the coast looks clear

921
00:43:05,343 --> 00:43:07,135
They call into the War Room in the next days

922
00:43:07,391 --> 00:43:08,671
Established

923
00:43:08,927 --> 00:43:09,439
The false flag

924
00:43:09,951 --> 00:43:10,463
Antifa

925
00:43:11,487 --> 00:43:13,023
You don't know if they themselves know it

926
00:43:13,279 --> 00:43:13,791
What's b*******

927
00:43:14,047 --> 00:43:15,071
And that they plan to do it

928
00:43:15,327 --> 00:43:15,839
Exactly what they

929
00:43:16,095 --> 00:43:17,631
Play data Megan joined it when it was happen

930
00:43:18,399 --> 00:43:21,983
Let me cry but Heather actually a good person once I have to answer for their actions

931
00:43:22,239 --> 00:43:22,751
And they get arrest

932
00:43:23,263 --> 00:43:24,543
I didn't know I was going to face

933
00:43:24,799 --> 00:43:26,079
Consequences

934
00:43:26,335 --> 00:43:32,479
Now this doesn't feel as good as it did when I was hurting people I'm going to take a break from crying to make

935
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:38,879
Make sure you don't have no about my telegram Channel if I hurt somebody then it's possible

936
00:43:39,135 --> 00:43:40,927
But I will then have consequences

937
00:43:41,183 --> 00:43:42,719
This is completely new to me in the United

938
00:43:44,255 --> 00:43:47,583
Yep but like Alex wakes up a lot of people into just being scared

939
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:49,119
And buying useless pills

940
00:43:49,375 --> 00:43:50,143
That is death

941
00:43:50,399 --> 00:43:50,911
Definitely true

942
00:43:51,423 --> 00:43:54,239
But a very small subset of the people he wakes up or Danny's

943
00:43:54,751 --> 00:43:57,311
Dynamic

944
00:43:57,567 --> 00:43:58,079
His legacy

945
00:43:59,359 --> 00:43:59,871
Concern

946
00:44:00,127 --> 00:44:00,895
Tucker

947
00:44:01,151 --> 00:44:01,919
Glenn Beck

948
00:44:02,175 --> 00:44:03,967
Dark matter you know what

949
00:44:04,223 --> 00:44:05,247
What's so weird

950
00:44:05,503 --> 00:44:07,551
Is that nothing

951
00:44:08,575 --> 00:44:13,439
Alex's effect on people reminds me of like a f****** Firefly and serenity

952
00:44:13,695 --> 00:44:17,535
Like the way that they never help me with that

953
00:44:17,791 --> 00:44:23,935
Did the Firefly show is with Nathan Fillion know what it is

954
00:44:24,191 --> 00:44:24,959
This whole thing the packs

955
00:44:25,215 --> 00:44:26,495
Right and it makes everybody

956
00:44:27,263 --> 00:44:32,639
But what they wind up creating something that made people sell Pacifier that they just wound up not living

957
00:44:32,895 --> 00:44:33,663
They just gave up

958
00:44:33,919 --> 00:44:35,199
You know where they stood

959
00:44:35,455 --> 00:44:38,015
Rough 10% of that population

960
00:44:38,271 --> 00:44:41,087
What the exact other way and got so viola

961
00:44:41,343 --> 00:44:42,623
Vicious and awful

962
00:44:42,879 --> 00:44:46,975
That they're now the Terrors of the universe or whatever and I was just keep thinking of like

963
00:44:47,231 --> 00:44:48,767
If you're an Infowars listener

964
00:44:49,023 --> 00:44:52,607
Most of them are just sitting there like a frayed shaking

965
00:44:52,863 --> 00:44:54,143
Or maybe posting

966
00:44:55,935 --> 00:44:58,751
It is getting on Facebook and posting memes and stuff

967
00:44:59,007 --> 00:44:59,775
But then there's that fun

968
00:45:00,031 --> 00:45:01,055
F****** 10% that's just

969
00:45:01,311 --> 00:45:03,103
Vicious ya-ya-ya

970
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:07,455
Metaphorically 10% who knows what the actual number is

971
00:45:07,711 --> 00:45:09,247
It goes on they embark on a

972
00:45:09,503 --> 00:45:10,015
Journey

973
00:45:10,271 --> 00:45:11,551
That leads to really

974
00:45:11,807 --> 00:45:13,599
Tasering a cop

975
00:45:13,855 --> 00:45:14,623
At the Capitol

976
00:45:14,879 --> 00:45:17,183
And planning to to stuff like that

977
00:45:18,207 --> 00:45:21,791
And then the other part that I find really disgraceful is the way in which

978
00:45:22,303 --> 00:45:24,095
Immediately afterwards

979
00:45:24,351 --> 00:45:25,631
You call into Infowars

980
00:45:25,887 --> 00:45:28,447
To try and help build up a narrative

981
00:45:28,703 --> 00:45:30,751
No you did

982
00:45:31,519 --> 00:45:33,823
Cypress Imaging

983
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:34,591
It's real

984
00:45:34,847 --> 00:45:35,359
It says

985
00:45:36,127 --> 00:45:36,895
Just amazing

986
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:39,455
How did you how were you the guy at the back

987
00:45:39,711 --> 00:45:40,223
The blue event

988
00:45:40,479 --> 00:45:43,295
And then the guy who heard the cop that doesn't make sense

989
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:47,135
Condition about race not about cops body

990
00:45:48,415 --> 00:45:49,439
Is it already

991
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:54,815
At least the sport back the blue

992
00:45:55,071 --> 00:45:55,583
Absolutely

993
00:45:58,399 --> 00:45:58,911
You know what

994
00:45:59,167 --> 00:46:00,191
Sometimes

995
00:46:00,447 --> 00:46:01,983
Things get a little bit like that for

996
00:46:02,239 --> 00:46:04,287
And I'll do something to palate cleanser

997
00:46:04,543 --> 00:46:05,823
This next step is not that

998
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:08,639
Oh no I was hoping he's going to sing

999
00:46:08,895 --> 00:46:10,687
It's kind of like when you need

1000
00:46:10,943 --> 00:46:11,711
If you'd like

1001
00:46:11,967 --> 00:46:12,991
Something to

1002
00:46:13,247 --> 00:46:15,039
Glenn fallat

1003
00:46:15,295 --> 00:46:19,391
A different Flavor jelly beans

1004
00:46:19,903 --> 00:46:20,927
It's like

1005
00:46:21,183 --> 00:46:22,207
Like a booger

1006
00:46:22,463 --> 00:46:24,767
Aggressive mustard jelly beans

1007
00:46:25,279 --> 00:46:26,815
This is not a palate cleanser

1008
00:46:27,583 --> 00:46:29,631
Breakfast with my girl.

1009
00:46:36,031 --> 00:46:36,799
Usher love you so

1010
00:46:38,335 --> 00:46:38,847
Show Daddy

1011
00:46:43,711 --> 00:46:44,223
Sure what it is

1012
00:46:53,183 --> 00:46:53,695
My daughter but she did

1013
00:46:54,975 --> 00:46:56,511
Text my mom

1014
00:46:57,023 --> 00:46:58,047
Show me will sweetheart

1015
00:47:02,655 --> 00:47:03,167
I never saw

1016
00:47:04,959 --> 00:47:05,471
Well

1017
00:47:07,263 --> 00:47:07,775
Oh my

1018
00:47:08,287 --> 00:47:08,799
Oh man

1019
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:11,615
You have your hand on your forehead

1020
00:47:11,871 --> 00:47:15,711
That's that's just I'm not going to be a parent

1021
00:47:15,967 --> 00:47:20,831
And I haven't read many parenting books I'm going to go with that one's not in there

1022
00:47:21,343 --> 00:47:27,487
Dr. Sparks book was mostly about show me your will

1023
00:47:28,767 --> 00:47:33,119
You know you know how creepy devil noises

1024
00:47:33,375 --> 00:47:34,399
Excuse me daughter

1025
00:47:34,655 --> 00:47:39,007
Daughter you know the sounds good my theoretical demons make when they see me

1026
00:47:39,519 --> 00:47:45,663
Make those towards me on purpose cuz it means you're good it's kind of interesting

1027
00:47:45,919 --> 00:47:50,527
To imply that stuff that he does on his show bleeds into his personal life

1028
00:47:51,551 --> 00:47:52,063
Daughter

1029
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:54,367
Is aware on some level of making

1030
00:47:54,623 --> 00:47:55,903
Weird demon noises

1031
00:47:56,159 --> 00:48:02,303
Yeah you must do that at all

1032
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:08,703
Beyond me yeah

1033
00:48:08,959 --> 00:48:12,543
Alright

1034
00:48:12,799 --> 00:48:13,311
Cuz he's beautiful

1035
00:48:18,431 --> 00:48:20,223
Poison control

1036
00:48:25,087 --> 00:48:25,599
Add

1037
00:48:27,903 --> 00:48:29,439
Because they know we're beautiful

1038
00:48:29,695 --> 00:48:31,231
They know we love God they know

1039
00:48:33,279 --> 00:48:34,303
And they want to kill us

1040
00:48:35,327 --> 00:48:38,911
Beautiful black skin a beautiful white skin a beautiful brown skin

1041
00:48:39,167 --> 00:48:42,495
You all got red-blooded God Made You And if you love God the devil h

1042
00:48:43,519 --> 00:48:44,799
Club Cafe

1043
00:48:50,175 --> 00:48:53,503
Jean are so incredible and I want you to take stock

1044
00:48:53,759 --> 00:48:54,527
In your will

1045
00:48:54,783 --> 00:48:55,551
The God gave you two

1046
00:48:55,807 --> 00:48:56,831
Exercise

1047
00:48:57,599 --> 00:49:00,415
Exercise your will

1048
00:49:04,767 --> 00:49:05,279
Coin yesterday

1049
00:49:08,607 --> 00:49:10,911
Then I won't be all these writing projects that are getting launched

1050
00:49:12,191 --> 00:49:12,959
There will be

1051
00:49:13,215 --> 00:49:15,007
Alex is now selling a silver

1052
00:49:15,263 --> 00:49:15,775
Pork loin

1053
00:49:16,287 --> 00:49:18,079
He's pretending it's some kind of a war bond

1054
00:49:18,335 --> 00:49:20,127
It's a lot of fun

1055
00:49:20,383 --> 00:49:22,431
Imply that you be willing

1056
00:49:22,687 --> 00:49:26,783
To buy all of them back in a certain point but I'm guessing that's not part of the

1057
00:49:27,039 --> 00:49:27,551
I wouldn't think

1058
00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:29,343
Who is Mike sense

1059
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:32,671
I was just probably just marketing someone else's coins and making a

1060
00:49:32,927 --> 00:49:37,023
Haircut but there's one really interesting thing that I found in the fine print

1061
00:49:38,303 --> 00:49:39,583
Due to current restrictions

1062
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:43,423
This custom round is not available for sale to the state of Minnesota

1063
00:49:43,935 --> 00:49:44,703
Weird

1064
00:49:44,959 --> 00:49:48,031
But it has nothing to do with Ted Anderson living in Minnesota

1065
00:49:48,287 --> 00:49:52,127
Got to be a coincidence was involved

1066
00:49:52,895 --> 00:49:59,039
Then the only state that he wouldn't be allowed to sell this in would be that's why I don't know if he's actually involved

1067
00:49:59,551 --> 00:50:05,695
I honestly think it could be a coincidence and there's some sort of a weird law that they Minnesota's just like

1068
00:50:05,951 --> 00:50:12,095
Gold sales

1069
00:50:12,607 --> 00:50:13,375
Sing people

1070
00:50:13,631 --> 00:50:14,143
Probably

1071
00:50:14,399 --> 00:50:14,911
Also

1072
00:50:15,423 --> 00:50:16,191
Coin cost

1073
00:50:16,447 --> 00:50:20,287
$129 and is one troy ounce of silver

1074
00:50:20,799 --> 00:50:21,567
In the past

1075
00:50:21,823 --> 00:50:26,175
30 years the highest an ounce of silver has ever been worth his $42.88 back

1076
00:50:26,431 --> 00:50:27,455
Can April 2011

1077
00:50:27,967 --> 00:50:31,039
And the price is currently around $22.29

1078
00:50:31,807 --> 00:50:35,647
This is a heroic level of policing Alex is trying to pull off

1079
00:50:35,903 --> 00:50:39,487
On eBay you can fly to 3 Troy oz silver Tiki head for

1080
00:50:39,743 --> 00:50:42,559
25 bucks less than Alex is dumb coin

1081
00:50:43,071 --> 00:50:47,423
31 bucks you can get a 1 oz silver coin with Snoopy from peanuts doing

1082
00:50:47,679 --> 00:50:48,703
Sonic

1083
00:50:48,959 --> 00:50:49,727
You know that he's never

1084
00:50:49,983 --> 00:50:51,263
Overthrown

1085
00:50:51,519 --> 00:50:56,127
Kingdom of the Red Baron that's true that's true but that Red Baron was a monarch

1086
00:50:56,383 --> 00:51:02,527
For 47 bucks you can get a 1 oz silver coin with Joe Campbell on it from 1930

1087
00:51:02,783 --> 00:51:07,647
Very classic

1088
00:51:07,903 --> 00:51:09,951
Milford suddenly wanted a coin

1089
00:51:10,207 --> 00:51:14,303
Joe Cool stupid

1090
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:16,095
Speed scams I wouldn't do that

1091
00:51:16,351 --> 00:51:18,143
Joe Cool 1913 I want it

1092
00:51:19,167 --> 00:51:21,215
What's a silver Cthulhu coin to

1093
00:51:21,471 --> 00:51:24,543
And on the backside of it is weirdly Queen

1094
00:51:25,311 --> 00:51:27,103
I don't know why it legal

1095
00:51:27,615 --> 00:51:30,431
Silver and Allstate all spend

1096
00:51:30,687 --> 00:51:32,223
I was very close to buying

1097
00:51:32,479 --> 00:51:36,575
Joe Campbell

1098
00:51:37,087 --> 00:51:39,135
Absarokee actually does address

1099
00:51:39,391 --> 00:51:41,951
The fact that this is a ridiculous markup

1100
00:51:52,447 --> 00:51:55,519
You're getting a coin and momenta other resistance it says

1101
00:51:58,335 --> 00:51:59,359
King George

1102
00:51:59,615 --> 00:52:01,151
What eating with children

1103
00:52:04,223 --> 00:52:06,271
It's the founder of our country the archetype of

1104
00:52:07,807 --> 00:52:10,879
Killing the dragon Place gentleman of Christ

1105
00:52:11,647 --> 00:52:12,159
What

1106
00:52:12,415 --> 00:52:13,439
His archangel

1107
00:52:13,951 --> 00:52:14,463
Saint Michael

1108
00:52:15,487 --> 00:52:18,303
And an end that's what this is

1109
00:52:24,191 --> 00:52:24,703
What

1110
00:52:26,751 --> 00:52:28,543
It's a powerful coin

1111
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:32,383
Faithfully resisting in Latin on the back

1112
00:52:32,895 --> 00:52:33,919
Always resisting

1113
00:52:34,943 --> 00:52:35,711
Turn on the front

1114
00:52:36,479 --> 00:52:38,015
Always left the tyrants

1115
00:52:40,575 --> 00:52:45,183
I don't even want to try and unpack the idea that George Washington was somehow like an avatar of the Christ

1116
00:52:45,439 --> 00:52:46,207
Spirit or whatever

1117
00:52:46,463 --> 00:52:47,487
Like a

1118
00:52:47,743 --> 00:52:49,279
Kind of implies that Alex was

1119
00:52:49,535 --> 00:52:50,559
Trying to say that

1120
00:52:50,815 --> 00:52:51,327
Trump was

1121
00:52:51,583 --> 00:52:53,119
Is like an avatar of Jesus

1122
00:52:53,375 --> 00:52:53,887
I guess

1123
00:52:55,167 --> 00:52:56,447
The Christ Spirit exists

1124
00:52:56,959 --> 00:52:59,775
Like over and over again same way that like there's an antichrist

1125
00:53:00,031 --> 00:53:01,055
Right then

1126
00:53:01,567 --> 00:53:02,847
That was Debbie

1127
00:53:04,127 --> 00:53:05,663
Treated Trump like he thought he was

1128
00:53:05,919 --> 00:53:08,223
Incarnation of Jesus true

1129
00:53:08,479 --> 00:53:10,015
That's maybe a little sacrilegious

1130
00:53:10,271 --> 00:53:11,551
Would you want

1131
00:53:12,063 --> 00:53:12,831
John Wilkes

1132
00:53:13,087 --> 00:53:15,391
Booth last words to be on your coin

1133
00:53:15,647 --> 00:53:17,439
Yeah history

1134
00:53:17,695 --> 00:53:18,975
Tree is a little bit

1135
00:53:19,231 --> 00:53:22,047
Iffy

1136
00:53:22,303 --> 00:53:26,143
Schlage Abraham Lincoln is a dragon that would make more sense

1137
00:53:27,935 --> 00:53:30,239
6/2 Rands is something

1138
00:53:30,751 --> 00:53:34,079
Existed prior to call John Wilkes Booth

1139
00:53:34,335 --> 00:53:38,687
Terms of American history that is definitely contacts

1140
00:53:38,943 --> 00:53:39,711
The people have for that

1141
00:53:40,223 --> 00:53:41,759
Hey kind of ruined the turf

1142
00:53:42,015 --> 00:53:45,599
It really didn't end up together with the guy who ended

1143
00:53:45,855 --> 00:53:47,391
Slavery being killed

1144
00:53:47,647 --> 00:53:52,767
Even more Infowars adjacent place that that the expression pops up

1145
00:53:53,023 --> 00:53:57,631
Timothy mcveigh's famous mugshot every blew up the Murrah building he's wearing a shirt

1146
00:53:57,887 --> 00:53:59,167
A taranis

1147
00:53:59,423 --> 00:54:00,447
With a picture of Lincoln on it

1148
00:54:00,703 --> 00:54:01,727
Great

1149
00:54:01,983 --> 00:54:02,495
Straight

1150
00:54:02,751 --> 00:54:08,895
It does feel a little bit like you might be signaling a tiny bit so that this going

1151
00:54:09,151 --> 00:54:12,479
Baby the war of Northern aggression

1152
00:54:15,551 --> 00:54:16,831
That seems this

1153
00:54:17,087 --> 00:54:17,599
Deadline

1154
00:54:17,855 --> 00:54:18,367
Advice

1155
00:54:18,623 --> 00:54:22,975
Little bit on the other side of a little bit mad about

1156
00:54:23,487 --> 00:54:25,279
Spices come out in freak out

1157
00:54:25,535 --> 00:54:26,815
About freaked out

1158
00:54:28,095 --> 00:54:30,911
Occultic New Age brainwashing hypnotism

1159
00:54:34,239 --> 00:54:36,031
No you're the ones we're doing the brainwashing

1160
00:54:40,383 --> 00:54:40,895
This is

1161
00:54:43,711 --> 00:54:45,503
Alex Jones oh my goodness

1162
00:54:47,807 --> 00:54:49,599
Keep on wishing

1163
00:54:53,183 --> 00:54:56,767
A little bit

1164
00:54:57,023 --> 00:54:59,071
About the article a bit buddy

1165
00:54:59,327 --> 00:55:00,095
Never mentioned

1166
00:55:00,351 --> 00:55:01,375
Stas

1167
00:55:02,655 --> 00:55:03,935
First I thought was a little bit strange

1168
00:55:04,191 --> 00:55:07,007
Because he's talking about how they were afraid of reset

1169
00:55:07,263 --> 00:55:08,543
I was

1170
00:55:08,799 --> 00:55:14,943
The person who talked to her about reset Wars animal in the writer the story

1171
00:55:15,199 --> 00:55:17,759
I also interviewed for the story

1172
00:55:18,271 --> 00:55:21,343
But as far as I can tell I was the only person who was like

1173
00:55:21,599 --> 00:55:27,743
Hey look at this crazy nonsense

1174
00:55:27,999 --> 00:55:31,839
Tells you you can just imagine more money coming to you

1175
00:55:32,095 --> 00:55:33,119
Antelope

1176
00:55:33,375 --> 00:55:37,727
Before I didn't actually read the article what I do come out because I get a little bit

1177
00:55:37,983 --> 00:55:38,495
Uncomfortable

1178
00:55:39,007 --> 00:55:39,519
Would like chasing

1179
00:55:39,775 --> 00:55:41,055
Turn down clipping but I don't do it

1180
00:55:41,311 --> 00:55:43,871
Interviews I did your own grandpa

1181
00:55:44,383 --> 00:55:48,991
Right right and so when I heard Alex talk about the reset Wars stuff I was like

1182
00:55:50,015 --> 00:55:51,039
I can't imagine

1183
00:55:52,063 --> 00:55:54,367
Jon Ronson was talking about reset water

1184
00:55:55,135 --> 00:55:56,159
I've not heard

1185
00:55:56,415 --> 00:56:02,559
Anybody except us bring this up we spoke to him was like I don't pay attention to him

1186
00:56:02,815 --> 00:56:03,583
Given the present

1187
00:56:03,839 --> 00:56:08,191
For good reason like I thought like oh this is a clearly intentional thing

1188
00:56:08,447 --> 00:56:09,215
He's knows that this

1189
00:56:09,471 --> 00:56:12,543
Article deals with reset Warriors and he's intentionally not mentioning

1190
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:14,847
Again it within

1191
00:56:15,103 --> 00:56:16,127
The pattern and once again

1192
00:56:16,639 --> 00:56:18,431
But I when I read the article and

1193
00:56:18,687 --> 00:56:20,479
You could take away from it that

1194
00:56:21,503 --> 00:56:25,343
Was just bringing up Reese at work could come off

1195
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:27,135
Off of that the article itself

1196
00:56:27,647 --> 00:56:29,183
I have information about it

1197
00:56:29,439 --> 00:56:29,951
And that a comment

1198
00:56:33,279 --> 00:56:38,911
It's very possible that I could have seen this and not recognize that

1199
00:56:39,167 --> 00:56:41,727
I think I think a lot of the like hey what up what's up

1200
00:56:43,007 --> 00:56:46,847
I can tell you is dealing with this

1201
00:56:47,103 --> 00:56:49,919
Yeah it might not come off that I think that I was

1202
00:56:50,431 --> 00:56:52,991
Obsessively talking about this

1203
00:56:53,247 --> 00:56:59,135
Wasn't quite that she was like can you have so many more like shut the f****** it's right that was we got her talking about right now

1204
00:56:59,391 --> 00:57:03,743
What are you up to

1205
00:57:03,999 --> 00:57:08,351
The most important work of the story Rings hanging out with a weirdo hypnosis

1206
00:57:09,119 --> 00:57:11,167
That's how you start a conversation

1207
00:57:12,447 --> 00:57:15,007
So anyway Alex doesn't bring us up

1208
00:57:15,263 --> 00:57:17,823
Which is I put it up on the board for 20

1209
00:57:18,079 --> 00:57:20,383
Or whatever

1210
00:57:20,895 --> 00:57:22,431
Glenn Beck now

1211
00:57:23,455 --> 00:57:27,551
Because Glenn Beck is gotten weird they went on Tucker's show

1212
00:57:27,807 --> 00:57:28,575
Inside somebody

1213
00:57:28,831 --> 00:57:29,855
Conspiracy ship

1214
00:57:30,367 --> 00:57:34,719
Well the Gateway pundit got it right when they put huge in front of the headline

1215
00:57:35,743 --> 00:57:38,303
Tucker Carlson

1216
00:57:38,815 --> 00:57:43,423
Us doctors were reviewing moderna vaccine 2019

1217
00:57:43,679 --> 00:57:45,471
Ash

1218
00:57:46,239 --> 00:57:49,311
They were calling covid-19

1219
00:57:56,223 --> 00:57:58,527
Bunch of viruses

1220
00:57:58,783 --> 00:57:59,807
With the

1221
00:58:01,855 --> 00:58:03,135
Set the description covid-19

1222
00:58:03,647 --> 00:58:04,671
Months

1223
00:58:05,951 --> 00:58:08,767
Before we hear the name and they're already running

1224
00:58:09,023 --> 00:58:14,143
Moderna vaccine for what they cooked up at a lab all confirmed in the emails now

1225
00:58:14,399 --> 00:58:19,519
Glenn Beck went on Tucker and misrepresented in agreement between moderna and the niaid

1226
00:58:19,775 --> 00:58:23,615
Where they were working on collaborating on a vaccine for covid before Mercer

1227
00:58:24,383 --> 00:58:30,527
I know it's fun to finish dum-dum just either work coronavirus and assumed this must be secret evidence that they are working on covid vaccine

1228
00:58:30,783 --> 00:58:31,807
Before we do about covid

1229
00:58:32,319 --> 00:58:33,599
The coronavirus is out there

1230
00:58:34,111 --> 00:58:34,879
This isn't even news

1231
00:58:35,391 --> 00:58:38,975
Conspiracy theorist tried to push this narrative back in June and it went nowhere so I guess

1232
00:58:39,231 --> 00:58:39,743
Stop going back

1233
00:58:39,999 --> 00:58:40,511
I was just trying to reach

1234
00:58:40,767 --> 00:58:42,047
Reheat it

1235
00:58:42,559 --> 00:58:47,423
You know what your own little spin on it it's like a it's like remaking Family Ties

1236
00:58:48,447 --> 00:58:50,495
Can you stop for a second and Rec

1237
00:58:50,751 --> 00:58:51,263
Thick thighs

1238
00:58:51,519 --> 00:58:55,871
How lucky we are to live in 2021 when we can see

1239
00:58:56,127 --> 00:59:02,271
F****** Bow-Tie guy in Mister chalkboard get together and try and Rehab their images by spouting covid conspiracy

1240
00:59:02,527 --> 00:59:04,063
How is it possible

1241
00:59:04,319 --> 00:59:07,135
How is it possible I thought we were done with these

1242
00:59:07,391 --> 00:59:08,671
Dix 15 years ago

1243
00:59:08,927 --> 00:59:12,511
Glenn Beck apologize with Samantha Bee

1244
00:59:13,023 --> 00:59:13,535
Jesus

1245
00:59:16,863 --> 00:59:18,143
None of that happened

1246
00:59:19,167 --> 00:59:22,495
Some weird analysis hear about Russia in his concern

1247
00:59:22,751 --> 00:59:23,263
About

1248
00:59:23,519 --> 00:59:24,031
The new king

1249
00:59:26,847 --> 00:59:27,359
Concerned

1250
00:59:28,127 --> 00:59:29,407
Morgan

1251
00:59:29,663 --> 00:59:31,967
Building

1252
00:59:32,735 --> 00:59:33,503
Show

1253
00:59:35,295 --> 00:59:35,807
Just been

1254
00:59:39,647 --> 00:59:40,159
In Europe

1255
00:59:45,791 --> 00:59:46,815
That major Wars

1256
00:59:49,119 --> 00:59:50,911
U.s. senator

1257
00:59:51,679 --> 00:59:52,703
Rodger Whittaker

1258
00:59:53,471 --> 00:59:57,055
Rob say everything's on the table including a pre-emptive first-strike

1259
00:59:57,311 --> 01:00:00,639
A sneak attack Pearl Harbor

1260
01:00:01,151 --> 01:00:02,175
Was Conventional Weapons

1261
01:00:03,711 --> 01:00:04,991
Bombs and torpedoes

1262
01:00:06,015 --> 01:00:07,807
No it was bad

1263
01:00:12,415 --> 01:00:13,439
Rodger Whittaker

1264
01:00:14,463 --> 01:00:15,487
Mississippi

1265
01:00:15,743 --> 01:00:18,559
Maybe he can come out and tell us how the Japanese were good

1266
01:00:18,815 --> 01:00:22,399
You think the Pearl Harbor was a false flag I was going to say

1267
01:00:22,655 --> 01:00:24,191
What is happening

1268
01:00:25,727 --> 01:00:28,031
Straight b******* straight

1269
01:00:28,287 --> 01:00:29,311
If you're going to create an ad

1270
01:00:29,567 --> 01:00:33,151
Expanded universe at least in Marvel Universe when they retcon something

1271
01:00:33,407 --> 01:00:33,919
Tell you

1272
01:00:34,175 --> 01:00:36,223
They're like a hand wave

1273
01:00:36,479 --> 01:00:39,551
Alex Wilson some really weird ideas about like we're borders

1274
01:00:39,807 --> 01:00:41,599
Exist

1275
01:00:42,111 --> 01:00:47,231
Is the time that you should stop recognizing changes to borders I mean

1276
01:00:47,487 --> 01:00:53,631
In his mind I think the entire continent of Africa was just renamed Rhodesia so I don't know how many borders matter they

1277
01:00:53,887 --> 01:00:56,703
Germination

1278
01:01:00,031 --> 01:01:01,055
All the Rodger Whittaker again

1279
01:01:01,311 --> 01:01:02,591
Not his name

1280
01:01:03,871 --> 01:01:04,895
Is talking s*** on Fox News

1281
01:01:06,431 --> 01:01:10,015
I mean granted there are reasons to be like mine full of and watch

1282
01:01:10,271 --> 01:01:11,039
Situation

1283
01:01:11,295 --> 01:01:12,319
As it relates to Russian

1284
01:01:12,575 --> 01:01:13,087
Ukraine

1285
01:01:13,343 --> 01:01:13,855
And do you have

1286
01:01:14,111 --> 01:01:15,135
His response to it but

1287
01:01:15,391 --> 01:01:17,439
That it I think that everybody knows it

1288
01:01:17,695 --> 01:01:18,463
It's preposterous

1289
01:01:18,719 --> 01:01:19,231
To say like we're going to

1290
01:01:19,487 --> 01:01:19,999
First strike

1291
01:01:20,255 --> 01:01:21,023
Nuclear attack

1292
01:01:21,535 --> 01:01:24,607
Really fun for Alex and his friends to get back in

1293
01:01:24,863 --> 01:01:31,007
Into the Cold War

1294
01:01:31,263 --> 01:01:31,775
I don't I don't

1295
01:01:32,287 --> 01:01:32,799
This is productive

1296
01:01:33,823 --> 01:01:34,591
Speaking of unproductive

1297
01:01:35,359 --> 01:01:40,735
Alex decides to spend a little time

1298
01:01:40,991 --> 01:01:41,759
Chasing the world

1299
01:01:42,783 --> 01:01:45,855
And some of them are end-of-days stuff

1300
01:01:47,135 --> 01:01:47,647
Which

1301
01:01:48,671 --> 01:01:49,183
You'll never go

1302
01:01:49,439 --> 01:01:49,951
Okay

1303
01:01:50,975 --> 01:01:53,279
Let's end racism in America yeah that's our big

1304
01:01:54,815 --> 01:01:55,839
Looks looks

1305
01:01:56,095 --> 01:01:57,375
Chopsticks is a Mudslide

1306
01:01:57,631 --> 01:01:59,679
All the new winner of the international

1307
01:01:59,935 --> 01:02:06,079
The top

1308
01:02:07,871 --> 01:02:09,663
We're going to accept a man

1309
01:02:11,455 --> 01:02:12,479
Pointiest

1310
01:02:14,271 --> 01:02:16,063
Men are taking over women's forged

1311
01:02:17,855 --> 01:02:20,927
Man

1312
01:02:21,183 --> 01:02:24,767
Woman swimming match

1313
01:02:25,023 --> 01:02:25,791
Wrestling match

1314
01:02:30,143 --> 01:02:31,167
Lea Thomas

1315
01:02:36,287 --> 01:02:37,311
Is Val the top

1316
01:02:39,103 --> 01:02:42,431
X Converse

1317
01:02:42,943 --> 01:02:45,247
I find myself fascinated by the sorts of things Alex

1318
01:02:45,503 --> 01:02:46,783
Considers End of Days

1319
01:02:47,039 --> 01:02:47,551
Stop

1320
01:02:48,063 --> 01:02:49,087
Is trans athletes

1321
01:02:49,343 --> 01:02:50,623
This is evidence of the Apocalypse

1322
01:02:54,463 --> 01:02:55,231
Ridiculous

1323
01:02:55,487 --> 01:03:01,119
The Olympics will be overtaken as for Leah Thomas the transformer Alex's maligning

1324
01:03:01,375 --> 01:03:02,399
Really good meat

1325
01:03:02,655 --> 01:03:04,959
At the recent Zippy Invitational

1326
01:03:05,215 --> 01:03:06,495
I also think that Alex is just

1327
01:03:06,751 --> 01:03:08,287
Read clickbait headlines about this

1328
01:03:08,543 --> 01:03:09,311
Forgot to actually looking

1329
01:03:10,591 --> 01:03:14,687
Is true that Leah sent me quote pool and meet record on the 500-meter free

1330
01:03:14,943 --> 01:03:15,967
During the event

1331
01:03:16,223 --> 01:03:17,759
And that her time is currently the best

1332
01:03:18,015 --> 01:03:18,527
Best in the country

1333
01:03:19,039 --> 01:03:22,879
It is true that you said a couple other pool and meet records and other events

1334
01:03:23,391 --> 01:03:26,207
Really accurate to say that she's the best swimmer in the world

1335
01:03:26,463 --> 01:03:30,303
The one thing Alex's just glossing over the fact that the same beat Leah finished

1336
01:03:30,559 --> 01:03:31,327
Fifth of the fifth

1337
01:03:31,583 --> 01:03:32,095
Demeter free

1338
01:03:32,607 --> 01:03:35,935
And fourth in the Quaker of 400m medley relay

1339
01:03:36,447 --> 01:03:39,775
He's a swimmer who's good at some event and apparently not as good at others

1340
01:03:40,031 --> 01:03:41,055
Just like any other athlete

1341
01:03:41,823 --> 01:03:43,103
This isn't stuff

1342
01:03:43,359 --> 01:03:45,407
It's just another manifestation of Alex's bigoted RI

1343
01:03:45,919 --> 01:03:47,967
Imagine he actually cares at all about women

1344
01:03:48,223 --> 01:03:48,991
Collegiate swimming

1345
01:03:49,247 --> 01:03:50,783
Like to take collagen shity

1346
01:03:51,807 --> 01:03:53,087
What are you doing I mean

1347
01:03:54,111 --> 01:03:56,927
Again this is like go back 50 years was like well

1348
01:03:57,183 --> 01:03:59,487
I can't believe we're allowing women

1349
01:03:59,743 --> 01:04:02,047
Like it was just the same bulshit it's just

1350
01:04:02,303 --> 01:04:03,583
Updated I'm bored

1351
01:04:04,095 --> 01:04:04,607
It is

1352
01:04:04,863 --> 01:04:05,887
Spiritually

1353
01:04:06,143 --> 01:04:08,703
Almost the exact same

1354
01:04:08,959 --> 01:04:09,471
Yelp

1355
01:04:09,727 --> 01:04:13,055
So Alex now makes a deeply deeply transphobic

1356
01:04:13,311 --> 01:04:15,871
Narrative about the swimmer

1357
01:04:16,127 --> 01:04:16,639
But she

1358
01:04:17,919 --> 01:04:18,431
He can't

1359
01:04:23,551 --> 01:04:24,063
But

1360
01:04:24,319 --> 01:04:25,343
He's stunning and brave

1361
01:04:25,599 --> 01:04:29,695
$3 on a Wheaties box

1362
01:04:33,279 --> 01:04:34,559
All there is

1363
01:04:35,071 --> 01:04:36,095
There she is

1364
01:04:39,423 --> 01:04:39,935
Joke

1365
01:04:40,447 --> 01:04:41,983
Is a pretty standard thing for bigots

1366
01:04:42,239 --> 01:04:47,871
To suggest because there's a subtle implication baked into that statement that he's making that's inherently transphobic

1367
01:04:48,127 --> 01:04:48,639
Pier

1368
01:04:48,895 --> 01:04:50,175
Necessarily on the surface

1369
01:04:50,943 --> 01:04:52,479
Alex's suggesting that Leah couldn't

1370
01:04:52,735 --> 01:04:53,503
Can compete with the men

1371
01:04:53,759 --> 01:04:54,527
And so she transition

1372
01:04:55,039 --> 01:04:57,599
This allows Alex to make the claim that her transition was in

1373
01:04:57,855 --> 01:05:00,671
Inspired by a desire to swim against people that she cooked

1374
01:05:00,927 --> 01:05:01,439
Compete with

1375
01:05:01,951 --> 01:05:05,023
And he doesn't even have to say those exact words what you come off as really bad

1376
01:05:05,279 --> 01:05:07,327
You can make that that basically

1377
01:05:07,583 --> 01:05:09,119
That claim without actually making

1378
01:05:09,375 --> 01:05:10,399
Yeah that's gross

1379
01:05:11,167 --> 01:05:11,935
Essentially by holding

1380
01:05:12,191 --> 01:05:12,959
Kingsview Alex of giving

1381
01:05:13,215 --> 01:05:19,359
Voice to an idea that people's reasons were transitioning are not legitimate and they people likely or only doing it as a shortcut

1382
01:05:19,871 --> 01:05:20,383
Success

1383
01:05:20,639 --> 01:05:21,151
That's f***** up

1384
01:05:21,919 --> 01:05:25,759
It's stupid and it's based on absolutely nothing other than Alex's hateful imagination

1385
01:05:26,271 --> 01:05:30,111
Also pre-transition Leah was a really successful swimmer at UPenn

1386
01:05:30,879 --> 01:05:34,975
For instance in 2018 she broke the pool record for the 1000 free

1387
01:05:35,231 --> 01:05:37,023
And at that point in the season was the

1388
01:05:37,279 --> 01:05:38,047
The number for rent

1389
01:05:38,303 --> 01:05:39,583
Swimmer in the ivy league,

1390
01:05:40,351 --> 01:05:44,191
Before and after transition Lee has been an elite level swimmer

1391
01:05:44,447 --> 01:05:45,983
But Alex doesn't know any of that stuff

1392
01:05:46,239 --> 01:05:50,335
You just makes up a fence of storylines if it is prejudices and just reports those facts

1393
01:05:51,615 --> 01:05:53,151
Yeah yeah dumb

1394
01:05:53,407 --> 01:05:54,431
Yeah yeah

1395
01:05:54,943 --> 01:06:01,087
Guide to reality I think it is it is a great conclusion to make that someone would ever

1396
01:06:01,343 --> 01:06:03,903
Absolutely torture themselves

1397
01:06:04,159 --> 01:06:06,207
By living in a society that is 8

1398
01:06:06,463 --> 01:06:08,511
Angry and miserable and hateful

1399
01:06:08,767 --> 01:06:09,279
Towards you

1400
01:06:09,535 --> 01:06:10,303
Just so you can win a few

1401
01:06:10,559 --> 01:06:11,071
You collegiate

1402
01:06:12,351 --> 01:06:13,119
Yeah

1403
01:06:13,631 --> 01:06:15,935
Yeah it's it's a ludicrous proposition

1404
01:06:16,191 --> 01:06:17,983
And just based on

1405
01:06:19,007 --> 01:06:20,287
To create

1406
01:06:20,543 --> 01:06:21,311
Some kind of

1407
01:06:21,823 --> 01:06:27,711
A non hate-based reason for great

1408
01:06:27,967 --> 01:06:30,783
Trans people haha

1409
01:06:31,039 --> 01:06:31,551
Sports

1410
01:06:31,807 --> 01:06:34,879
I care a lot about women's Collegiate Sports

1411
01:06:36,159 --> 01:06:37,183
This is a little sweaty

1412
01:06:38,975 --> 01:06:42,815
He's trying to make this narrative that he has about Leah

1413
01:06:43,071 --> 01:06:44,607
Fit into his other narrative

1414
01:06:44,863 --> 01:06:46,143
Bono

1415
01:06:47,167 --> 01:06:49,983
I found this to be a little too hard

1416
01:06:52,543 --> 01:06:54,847
Mortgage companies

1417
01:06:57,151 --> 01:06:58,943
Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan

1418
01:07:02,783 --> 01:07:04,063
If they can get you

1419
01:07:10,207 --> 01:07:13,023
Who's the really famous Olympic swimmer dark hair

1420
01:07:13,279 --> 01:07:13,791
Tall guy

1421
01:07:15,583 --> 01:07:17,375
Michael Phelps just want to like always all metal

1422
01:07:18,911 --> 01:07:21,215
Best of everybody

1423
01:07:24,287 --> 01:07:24,799
What

1424
01:07:25,567 --> 01:07:29,151
But the only way

1425
01:07:29,407 --> 01:07:31,199
Did Michael Phelps what's going to happen

1426
01:07:42,719 --> 01:07:44,767
Dementia

1427
01:07:45,023 --> 01:07:46,815
I want to go down the women's division

1428
01:07:47,583 --> 01:07:48,095
I'm a woman

1429
01:07:54,751 --> 01:07:57,567
A lot of a lot of

1430
01:07:58,335 --> 01:08:01,407
Because I'm a signpost to hell I'm a signpost a collapse

1431
01:08:01,919 --> 01:08:03,711
On the signpost to the end of the world

1432
01:08:04,223 --> 01:08:06,015
A man

1433
01:08:06,271 --> 01:08:10,111
Can compete in women's sports and beat their ass in boxing

1434
01:08:10,367 --> 01:08:11,391
Orange

1435
01:08:11,647 --> 01:08:12,927
Orion MMA

1436
01:08:13,183 --> 01:08:17,023
We're all supposed to sit here

1437
01:08:17,791 --> 01:08:19,583
And go along with that light just like

1438
01:08:20,607 --> 01:08:22,911
7 shots

1439
01:08:23,167 --> 01:08:23,679
Subway

1440
01:08:24,191 --> 01:08:27,263
He's trying desperately to swing this into

1441
01:08:27,519 --> 01:08:33,663
Like a story about this Chinese

1442
01:08:33,919 --> 01:08:36,223
Weave that story

1443
01:08:36,479 --> 01:08:37,247
Come to this

1444
01:08:37,759 --> 01:08:39,039
How is he

1445
01:08:39,295 --> 01:08:39,807
Right here

1446
01:08:40,063 --> 01:08:45,439
And then into his lies story about Israel requiring 7 shot

1447
01:08:46,207 --> 01:08:48,511
It's just like I said it's sweaty

1448
01:08:48,767 --> 01:08:50,303
That's a lot of Hoops

1449
01:08:50,559 --> 01:08:51,327
To jump through

1450
01:08:51,583 --> 01:08:53,375
Returns at bat

1451
01:08:53,631 --> 01:08:54,911
It's very under

1452
01:08:55,167 --> 01:08:56,191
Compelling

1453
01:08:56,447 --> 01:09:00,031
I'll buy part I don't believe that any of this is

1454
01:09:02,591 --> 01:09:06,431
Materially related

1455
01:09:06,687 --> 01:09:08,735
I have a hard time believing that

1456
01:09:08,991 --> 01:09:09,503
Barry Bonds

1457
01:09:09,759 --> 01:09:10,783
Being

1458
01:09:11,039 --> 01:09:13,343
Kept out of the Hall of Fame is going to make him transition

1459
01:09:13,599 --> 01:09:14,111
Until we can get in

1460
01:09:14,367 --> 01:09:15,391
Into the Women's Softball Hall

1461
01:09:18,207 --> 01:09:19,999
I don't think that's how it's going to go

1462
01:09:20,511 --> 01:09:21,535
According to Alex

1463
01:09:25,119 --> 01:09:25,887
So answer the gas

1464
01:09:26,399 --> 01:09:26,911
At the end

1465
01:09:27,167 --> 01:09:30,495
The show

1466
01:09:31,263 --> 01:09:31,775
Okay

1467
01:09:32,031 --> 01:09:33,055
He's been kicked off Twitter

1468
01:09:34,591 --> 01:09:36,639
People on

1469
01:09:45,855 --> 01:09:47,135
Link to the

1470
01:09:47,391 --> 01:09:49,183
FDA documents

1471
01:09:49,951 --> 01:09:52,255
The final court order to release a little bit of them

1472
01:09:55,839 --> 01:09:56,351
Yeah

1473
01:09:56,607 --> 01:09:59,423
Posted these FDA documents on Twitter and got back

1474
01:09:59,679 --> 01:10:00,703
That's all you need to do

1475
01:10:00,959 --> 01:10:07,103
Not true I mean I assume there was some massive anti-semitic content somewhere along the line.

1476
01:10:07,359 --> 01:10:10,175
He was kicked off Twitter because he posted a long thread admission

1477
01:10:10,431 --> 01:10:12,223
Information about the IPA.

1478
01:10:13,503 --> 01:10:15,551
Being booted for posting

1479
01:10:15,807 --> 01:10:17,343
The document send and doing what

1480
01:10:18,367 --> 01:10:21,439
Haven't listened to your conversation about that would be one thing but it's not

1481
01:10:21,695 --> 01:10:22,207
Situation

1482
01:10:22,463 --> 01:10:23,999
Is misrepresenting its on of

1483
01:10:24,511 --> 01:10:25,791
I things from inside the

1484
01:10:26,047 --> 01:10:28,095
The same way that Alex does on his show

1485
01:10:28,863 --> 01:10:29,887
So look

1486
01:10:30,143 --> 01:10:31,935
Got these

1487
01:10:32,447 --> 01:10:32,959
These docks

1488
01:10:33,471 --> 01:10:34,239
From someone else

1489
01:10:34,495 --> 01:10:36,031
Twitter heat someone else with a smaller

1490
01:10:38,079 --> 01:10:39,103
And they turned his stomach

1491
01:10:39,359 --> 01:10:41,407
What golfer say we're just horrifying

1492
01:10:41,919 --> 01:10:45,247
Yeah look I mean I have a follower on Facebook

1493
01:10:45,759 --> 01:10:46,527
Take me to his

1494
01:10:46,783 --> 01:10:47,551
Little post

1495
01:10:48,063 --> 01:10:48,575
She doesn't have that

1496
01:10:48,831 --> 01:10:50,367
That much of a following so I

1497
01:10:50,623 --> 01:10:51,135
How to read

1498
01:10:51,903 --> 01:10:52,415
Mike Meisner

1499
01:10:52,671 --> 01:10:53,183
Stomach dropped

1500
01:10:53,951 --> 01:10:54,463
After I have 22

1501
01:10:54,719 --> 01:10:55,231
Weakest out

1502
01:10:55,999 --> 01:10:58,047
And all within a couple hours or just ate

1503
01:10:58,303 --> 01:10:59,583
Doo-wop listen notes

1504
01:10:59,839 --> 01:11:00,351
Documents are pretty

1505
01:11:00,607 --> 01:11:01,119
Scary

1506
01:11:01,375 --> 01:11:01,887
And

1507
01:11:03,679 --> 01:11:04,191
That's a lot of Santa

1508
01:11:05,471 --> 01:11:06,239
You know there's

1509
01:11:06,495 --> 01:11:08,031
Nobody wants to answer any

1510
01:11:08,543 --> 01:11:09,055
Nobody wants to talk

1511
01:11:09,567 --> 01:11:11,615
That's self-selected the group of doctors

1512
01:11:11,871 --> 01:11:12,383
You are talkin

1513
01:11:14,943 --> 01:11:16,479
Who can find doctors and scientists

1514
01:11:16,735 --> 01:11:17,503
Discussing this

1515
01:11:18,015 --> 01:11:20,319
Pretty easily

1516
01:11:21,087 --> 01:11:21,855
Does

1517
01:11:22,367 --> 01:11:23,903
Cause problem believe that

1518
01:11:24,159 --> 01:11:26,719
I do but I don't believe that there is a mom

1519
01:11:26,975 --> 01:11:29,791
Conspiracy among scientists about these.

1520
01:11:30,303 --> 01:11:33,375
I don't appreciate the Bible

1521
01:11:33,631 --> 01:11:37,727
The level of heroic myth-making it seems he's put into

1522
01:11:38,239 --> 01:11:40,031
I just read these documents and I realize

1523
01:11:41,055 --> 01:11:41,823
I had to tweak

1524
01:11:42,079 --> 01:11:48,223
It's outright like he's a f****** pianos

1525
01:11:48,479 --> 01:11:50,015
Twitter account

1526
01:11:50,271 --> 01:11:50,783
Yeah

1527
01:11:51,807 --> 01:11:53,087
Who makes another

1528
01:11:53,343 --> 01:11:54,623
Acclaim here

1529
01:11:55,135 --> 01:11:55,647
I don't

1530
01:11:57,695 --> 01:11:59,743
True

1531
01:12:01,023 --> 01:12:03,071
Conjecture that is that

1532
01:12:03,327 --> 01:12:04,351
It initially

1533
01:12:05,119 --> 01:12:05,887
Doctors

1534
01:12:06,143 --> 01:12:07,679
We're reporting things to like there

1535
01:12:08,191 --> 01:12:10,495
Joanne to the Pfizer Edwards

1536
01:12:10,751 --> 01:12:12,031
Events reporting

1537
01:12:13,823 --> 01:12:14,847
Fret

1538
01:12:18,431 --> 01:12:19,711
Okay well that's

1539
01:12:20,223 --> 01:12:20,735
The beginning

1540
01:12:21,247 --> 01:12:22,271
It was it was still

1541
01:12:22,527 --> 01:12:23,295
Pretty open

1542
01:12:24,319 --> 01:12:24,831
Or doctor

1543
01:12:25,343 --> 01:12:26,623
To speak outer or two

1544
01:12:26,879 --> 01:12:27,391
Give a call

1545
01:12:27,647 --> 01:12:28,415
2

1546
01:12:28,927 --> 01:12:29,695
Pfizer or

1547
01:12:29,951 --> 01:12:30,719
To the various data

1548
01:12:31,231 --> 01:12:31,999
And they weren't threatened

1549
01:12:32,255 --> 01:12:33,791
And about it today they're being threatened about it

1550
01:12:35,327 --> 01:12:36,351
Patient

1551
01:12:37,631 --> 01:12:38,143
I think they do that

1552
01:12:38,399 --> 01:12:39,423
How to get fired

1553
01:12:39,679 --> 01:12:40,191
Does who

1554
01:12:40,703 --> 01:12:41,983
Look even if you are in

1555
01:12:42,239 --> 01:12:43,263
An evil entity

1556
01:12:43,519 --> 01:12:44,287
Like who's

1557
01:12:44,543 --> 01:12:47,103
Like trying to kill people with the vaccines and stuff

1558
01:12:48,127 --> 01:12:49,407
It's still in your best interest

1559
01:12:49,663 --> 01:12:50,175
Stick out of that date

1560
01:12:53,247 --> 01:12:55,807
Yeah absolutely cuz you need you have to also have

1561
01:12:56,063 --> 01:12:57,343
Control over reality

1562
01:12:58,111 --> 01:12:59,903
In order to kind of unpredictable

1563
01:13:00,159 --> 01:13:02,463
Both of you need to know how people

1564
01:13:02,719 --> 01:13:03,487
That makes sense

1565
01:13:03,743 --> 01:13:05,535
I don't believe

1566
01:13:05,791 --> 01:13:07,071
Probably what doctors are being

1567
01:13:07,327 --> 01:13:08,095
Indoor fire

1568
01:13:08,607 --> 01:13:11,423
If they report adverse effects

1569
01:13:13,983 --> 01:13:15,519
Even if you were evil

1570
01:13:16,031 --> 01:13:19,871
You would still want the reporting of the opposite of people who survived

1571
01:13:21,407 --> 01:13:25,247
I just think that if you were able to produce

1572
01:13:25,503 --> 01:13:26,015
Proof

1573
01:13:26,271 --> 01:13:28,063
Maybe respond to it

1574
01:13:28,319 --> 01:13:28,831
Currently but I think

1575
01:13:29,599 --> 01:13:30,367
I think it's a joke

1576
01:13:30,623 --> 01:13:31,391
Because

1577
01:13:31,903 --> 01:13:33,695
He's talking s*** I want to know who's there

1578
01:13:33,951 --> 01:13:34,463
Heading home

1579
01:13:34,719 --> 01:13:37,023
That would be nice but also

1580
01:13:37,279 --> 01:13:38,815
He's just deciding without proof

1581
01:13:39,071 --> 01:13:43,679
Name plate like in this next clip he's decided that every single thing that's in that report is

1582
01:13:43,935 --> 01:13:46,239
Been proven to have been caused by the vector

1583
01:13:47,263 --> 01:13:48,031
42000

1584
01:13:48,543 --> 01:13:49,055
Complaints

1585
01:13:49,311 --> 01:13:50,079
Many of them

1586
01:13:52,383 --> 01:13:53,407
Pretty serious song

1587
01:13:54,175 --> 01:13:54,687
Pretty serious.

1588
01:13:55,455 --> 01:13:56,223
As you saw it

1589
01:13:57,247 --> 01:13:57,759
12:00

1590
01:13:58,015 --> 01:13:58,527
23

1591
01:13:59,551 --> 01:14:00,831
So if you look at the

1592
01:14:01,087 --> 01:14:01,599
If you Quan

1593
01:14:03,647 --> 01:14:04,159
N35

1594
01:14:04,671 --> 01:14:05,183
Side effects

1595
01:14:05,951 --> 01:14:06,463
Reply.

1596
01:14:07,743 --> 01:14:08,511
1 + 35

1597
01:14:09,791 --> 01:14:10,815
Unprecedented

1598
01:14:12,351 --> 01:14:13,631
Playing with their side effects

1599
01:14:13,887 --> 01:14:14,399
Sure

1600
01:14:14,655 --> 01:14:16,447
Is a little bit loaded

1601
01:14:17,471 --> 01:14:20,543
That's the implication and throughout the entire conversation

1602
01:14:20,799 --> 01:14:21,567
Is that all of this

1603
01:14:21,823 --> 01:14:22,591
This is caused by

1604
01:14:24,639 --> 01:14:25,407
Not founded

1605
01:14:25,663 --> 01:14:28,479
When you have the conversation being had on that

1606
01:14:28,991 --> 01:14:29,503
Oh my g

1607
01:14:29,759 --> 01:14:30,783
In those terms

1608
01:14:32,063 --> 01:14:32,831
What's pointless conversation

1609
01:14:33,087 --> 01:14:33,855
Just dumb

1610
01:14:34,367 --> 01:14:35,135
Not going

1611
01:14:35,391 --> 01:14:36,159
To get to truthful

1612
01:14:36,415 --> 01:14:37,183
From falsity

1613
01:14:38,719 --> 01:14:39,231
Also

1614
01:14:39,487 --> 01:14:40,255
42000

1615
01:14:40,511 --> 01:14:41,023
Is 4K

1616
01:14:41,535 --> 01:14:42,047
Nothing

1617
01:14:42,559 --> 01:14:44,351
You know like comparatively speaking

1618
01:14:44,863 --> 01:14:46,911
42000 is not even one-tenth

1619
01:14:47,167 --> 01:14:48,447
Does the people watching CNN

1620
01:14:50,495 --> 01:14:52,287
Just to give some kind of

1621
01:14:52,543 --> 01:14:53,823
Push back on that

1622
01:14:54,079 --> 01:14:58,175
This is only up to the 28th of February 20th

1623
01:14:58,431 --> 01:14:58,943
21

1624
01:14:59,199 --> 01:15:00,479
So at least it's

1625
01:15:00,735 --> 01:15:02,271
It's dated it only covers

1626
01:15:02,527 --> 01:15:03,039
A couple months

1627
01:15:03,551 --> 01:15:04,063
Vaccine

1628
01:15:04,319 --> 01:15:04,831
Information

1629
01:15:10,975 --> 01:15:11,743
But

1630
01:15:11,999 --> 01:15:17,887
It's not it's not as low of a number as it would be

1631
01:15:18,399 --> 01:15:19,167
Yeah

1632
01:15:23,007 --> 01:15:24,799
No it's really this guy lives in Israel

1633
01:15:26,591 --> 01:15:27,103
To know like

1634
01:15:27,359 --> 01:15:27,871
What

1635
01:15:28,639 --> 01:15:29,663
Why do

1636
01:15:29,919 --> 01:15:30,943
Globalists

1637
01:15:31,199 --> 01:15:31,967
All these bad guys

1638
01:15:32,479 --> 01:15:32,991
Really want to see

1639
01:15:33,503 --> 01:15:34,015
Israel

1640
01:15:35,039 --> 01:15:36,319
The clip is good

1641
01:15:38,879 --> 01:15:41,439
What is going on these foundations like why

1642
01:15:41,695 --> 01:15:44,511
Foundations the big money have the biggest hard-on

1643
01:15:45,023 --> 01:15:47,839
Choo choo choo to attack people in Israel

1644
01:15:51,423 --> 01:15:51,935
We can release dates

1645
01:15:52,191 --> 01:15:52,959
Justin

1646
01:15:53,215 --> 01:15:53,727
Israel's like this

1647
01:15:53,983 --> 01:15:54,495
Spearheaded

1648
01:15:55,007 --> 01:15:56,543
To spearhead so like we were the first

1649
01:15:58,335 --> 01:15:59,615
Any pregnant women we were the

1650
01:15:59,871 --> 01:16:00,383
First vaccinate

1651
01:16:02,687 --> 01:16:03,455
Company everywhere

1652
01:16:08,831 --> 01:16:09,343
Yeah

1653
01:16:09,599 --> 01:16:10,111
I mean

1654
01:16:10,367 --> 01:16:13,439
I can't I can't even try and imagine I mean looking for if you want to get down

1655
01:16:13,695 --> 01:16:16,255
Down deep the rabbit hole I mean

1656
01:16:16,767 --> 01:16:19,839
All the major positions in the CDC info

1657
01:16:20,095 --> 01:16:21,375
Pfizer going all these other

1658
01:16:21,631 --> 01:16:22,143
Companies

1659
01:16:22,399 --> 01:16:23,423
Companies that are pushing this all the

1660
01:16:24,191 --> 01:16:24,703
Call Jewish

1661
01:16:24,959 --> 01:16:25,983
So I mean

1662
01:16:26,239 --> 01:16:27,519
I mean I'm not going to I'm not going to

1663
01:16:27,775 --> 01:16:28,287
Let you know say that the

1664
01:16:28,543 --> 01:16:30,079
The craziest things but I'm just saying like

1665
01:16:30,335 --> 01:16:30,847
Pretty

1666
01:16:31,359 --> 01:16:31,871
Pretty weird

1667
01:16:32,383 --> 01:16:33,663
To see that all these people are in

1668
01:16:33,919 --> 01:16:36,479
Are Jewish and they're doing this to the Jewish shots and the Jewish

1669
01:16:36,991 --> 01:16:38,015
So there's there's a mess

1670
01:16:38,271 --> 01:16:40,319
Plan here and you know it I mean

1671
01:16:40,575 --> 01:16:41,087
Talking about it first

1672
01:16:41,599 --> 01:16:42,879
You know two decades at least

1673
01:16:45,951 --> 01:16:48,511
Silver has always been very own antibiotic

1674
01:16:49,791 --> 01:16:52,607
Listen I don't want to get too far down the rabbit

1675
01:16:52,863 --> 01:16:56,191
Butthole I mean you do what you don't want to do this but it is obviously

1676
01:16:56,447 --> 01:16:58,751
Conspiracy of the Jewish people to destroy the Jewish state

1677
01:16:59,263 --> 01:17:01,055
I'm not saying I'm just saying

1678
01:17:02,335 --> 01:17:08,479
Alex you've been saying that for 20 years so I mean you know that it's a conspiracy of Jewish people to destroy

1679
01:17:08,735 --> 01:17:09,759
Everybody knows

1680
01:17:10,527 --> 01:17:16,671
I'm not saying anything weird

1681
01:17:16,927 --> 01:17:18,463
Payment and all government is controlled by the

1682
01:17:18,719 --> 01:17:21,279
I understand

1683
01:17:21,535 --> 01:17:23,839
But this guy got kicked off Twitter any is a big-time got

1684
01:17:24,095 --> 01:17:24,863
I understand

1685
01:17:25,119 --> 01:17:25,631
Huge

1686
01:17:27,423 --> 01:17:31,519
Somebody somewhere knew about it

1687
01:17:35,615 --> 01:17:36,383
Pat said

1688
01:17:36,895 --> 01:17:38,175
After that

1689
01:17:38,431 --> 01:17:39,199
I might

1690
01:17:39,455 --> 01:17:40,479
Baked phone issue

1691
01:17:40,735 --> 01:17:44,831
Spider-Man

1692
01:17:45,087 --> 01:17:51,231
Doesn't want to piss off the anti-semites in his audiology

1693
01:17:51,487 --> 01:17:57,631
Take pics on Skype issues South packages all the time

1694
01:17:57,887 --> 01:18:04,031
Man from continuing to David indicating that it's common knowledge that I've

1695
01:18:04,287 --> 01:18:09,151
Been reporting essentially that's all I've been trying to say is that it's the globalist

1696
01:18:09,407 --> 01:18:10,687
Come on guys

1697
01:18:11,199 --> 01:18:12,735
He doesn't do that

1698
01:18:12,991 --> 01:18:16,063
Is Lament

1699
01:18:16,319 --> 01:18:17,087
The end of Truth

1700
01:18:17,855 --> 01:18:18,879
That's great

1701
01:18:19,135 --> 01:18:21,439
Sure except for he's doing it in response

1702
01:18:21,695 --> 01:18:23,743
What's to a question that Alex asked him

1703
01:18:23,999 --> 01:18:25,023
It's based on a false premise

1704
01:18:25,535 --> 01:18:26,815
Which is kind of ironic

1705
01:18:28,095 --> 01:18:33,471
Howard Howard Israelis that's the EpiCentre responding

1706
01:18:33,727 --> 01:18:34,239
This is

1707
01:18:37,055 --> 01:18:40,895
You're you're not actually that's why I'm sick you need to take a shot

1708
01:18:42,431 --> 01:18:44,479
There's no logic there

1709
01:18:47,295 --> 01:18:47,807
Logic

1710
01:18:48,319 --> 01:18:53,439
Definitely out the window in 2020 and 2021 has literally no logic there's no truth anymore

1711
01:18:53,695 --> 01:18:56,767
Now there's no truth anymore you ask me a question that's a lie

1712
01:18:57,023 --> 01:18:57,535
Yeah

1713
01:18:57,791 --> 01:19:03,935
How do you feel about the plague of pegasi absolutely destroying every Airline

1714
01:19:04,191 --> 01:19:08,287
Mister Airlines anymore

1715
01:19:08,543 --> 01:19:09,311
No one talk

1716
01:19:09,567 --> 01:19:12,383
Facts about the pegasi out there

1717
01:19:12,639 --> 01:19:18,271
The mainstream media is invested in bigpantha

1718
01:19:18,527 --> 01:19:19,807
It's the corporations

1719
01:19:20,063 --> 01:19:23,647
Who want to prop up the picket sign Arizona

1720
01:19:23,903 --> 01:19:24,927
I don't know if you've looked

1721
01:19:25,183 --> 01:19:27,743
Intuit but a lot of the people in major positions

1722
01:19:27,999 --> 01:19:29,791
The media are Pegasus

1723
01:19:32,095 --> 01:19:32,607
Boo

1724
01:19:32,863 --> 01:19:36,959
This caller is presenting as the major plan

1725
01:19:37,471 --> 01:19:41,567
Globalist

1726
01:19:41,823 --> 01:19:42,335
In order to get

1727
01:19:42,591 --> 01:19:44,383
People to be the track

1728
01:19:44,639 --> 01:19:46,431
Green passes

1729
01:19:46,943 --> 01:19:47,967
Social credit score

1730
01:19:48,223 --> 01:19:52,063
Which kind of runs counter to the entire idea that it's meant to kill you

1731
01:19:52,319 --> 01:19:53,087
Because why would they need

1732
01:19:53,855 --> 01:19:54,367
Cards

1733
01:19:54,623 --> 01:19:55,391
Tracking dead people

1734
01:19:55,647 --> 01:19:56,159
Who cares

1735
01:19:56,415 --> 01:19:57,695
Anyway the big plan is

1736
01:19:57,951 --> 01:19:59,487
According to Galileo is this tracking

1737
01:19:59,743 --> 01:20:00,511
And once they're able

1738
01:20:00,767 --> 01:20:02,559
They can turn off your

1739
01:20:02,815 --> 01:20:03,839
Your stuff at any minute

1740
01:20:04,095 --> 01:20:05,887
I meant he realizes that this

1741
01:20:06,143 --> 01:20:09,471
It's exactly like a documentary that Alex did in the past

1742
01:20:09,727 --> 01:20:11,007
Filmygod

1743
01:20:11,263 --> 01:20:13,311
They can't come up with a name of the guy the interview

1744
01:20:14,336 --> 01:20:15,104
Then once everything is done

1745
01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:15,872
Digital and they have

1746
01:20:16,128 --> 01:20:17,408
The screen passport and

1747
01:20:17,920 --> 01:20:18,432
You know

1748
01:20:18,688 --> 01:20:20,736
I think it was you speaking to

1749
01:20:21,504 --> 01:20:22,272
To mr. Ross

1750
01:20:23,040 --> 01:20:23,552
I think it was Ross

1751
01:20:23,808 --> 01:20:27,136
Saudi director of the American movie

1752
01:20:27,904 --> 01:20:28,416
It was a long time

1753
01:20:28,928 --> 01:20:30,976
He said all you have to do is is

1754
01:20:31,232 --> 01:20:31,744
Hit a button

1755
01:20:32,256 --> 01:20:34,048
And then your life is gone I could take away your life by

1756
01:20:34,560 --> 01:20:35,072
Pressing a button

1757
01:20:39,936 --> 01:20:40,448
Call job

1758
01:20:41,984 --> 01:20:43,008
What's his name

1759
01:20:43,776 --> 01:20:47,360
Exactly exactly

1760
01:20:47,616 --> 01:20:48,128
Okay

1761
01:20:50,432 --> 01:20:51,968
Good friend

01:20:52,480 --> 01:20:55,296
El Papa my name who made America freedom to Fascism guys

1763
01:20:55,552 --> 01:20:56,064

Castaway

1765
01:20:57,600 --> 01:20:58,368
Cancer

Anyways the whole time I was like Aaron Russo is Aaron Russo

1770
01:21:08,864 --> 01:21:09,376
Football guys

1771
01:21:09,888 --> 01:21:10,912
Alex are good friends with her

1772
01:21:12,960 --> 01:21:16,544
Revealed all this secret information to getting rotors name

1773
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:17,824
Does not really that important

1774
01:21:18,080 --> 01:21:20,128
Yeah you know you know it's b*******

1775
01:21:20,384 --> 01:21:21,664
I mean if you were

1776
01:21:21,920 --> 01:21:22,688
Earth-shattering info

1777
01:21:22,944 --> 01:21:24,992
I feel like I would remember your name

1778
01:21:27,040 --> 01:21:28,576
Also

1779
01:21:28,832 --> 01:21:29,600
Be totally clear

1780
01:21:29,856 --> 01:21:31,648
The Rockefellers didn't reveal

1781
01:21:31,904 --> 01:21:33,696
Aaron Russo if you don't remember

1782
01:21:33,952 --> 01:21:35,488
Talking to a guy named

1783
01:21:35,744 --> 01:21:37,024
Nicholas Rockefeller

1784
01:21:37,280 --> 01:21:38,816
Who is not related to the Rockefeller

1785
01:21:39,328 --> 01:21:42,400
Right who I was kind of a conman tank.

1786
01:21:42,912 --> 01:21:48,288
And I presented Aaron presented it as if he was in the Rockefeller family

1787
01:21:48,544 --> 01:21:50,080
And all this but that was not the

1788
01:21:50,592 --> 01:21:55,968
Regular old guy with the last name Rock

1789
01:21:56,480 --> 01:21:58,528
Yep no big deal but these dumb dumb

1790
01:21:58,784 --> 01:22:00,320
Don't even know that

1791
01:22:00,576 --> 01:22:03,136
I really take offense to is

1792
01:22:03,392 --> 01:22:06,720
Play calyx introduced gal by being like this person on Twitter is like

1793
01:22:06,976 --> 01:22:08,512
Good researcher

1794
01:22:09,536 --> 01:22:11,072
In charge of the information and such

1795
01:22:11,584 --> 01:22:12,608
And then like

1796
01:22:12,864 --> 01:22:15,424
You didn't take the time to ask yourself like

1797
01:22:15,936 --> 01:22:16,448
Did

1798
01:22:16,704 --> 01:22:19,008
Aaron Russo really talked to one of the Rockefellers

1799
01:22:19,776 --> 01:22:20,544
Like is this real

1800
01:22:20,800 --> 01:22:24,384
Well I mean it's been my experience that every human being with the last name Holmes

1801
01:22:24,640 --> 01:22:25,152
Has been related

1802
01:22:25,408 --> 01:22:28,224
Absolutely

1803
01:22:28,480 --> 01:22:29,248
Why not

1804
01:22:30,016 --> 01:22:32,064
You got some badass family member

1805
01:22:32,320 --> 01:22:34,368
Elizabeth Goodwin

1806
01:22:34,624 --> 01:22:36,416
Very yes

1807
01:22:37,696 --> 01:22:39,488
Not good Jordan your family sucks

1808
01:22:41,280 --> 01:22:45,120
And by the way it's got to be like the people who are just bad researchers who resolved

1809
01:22:45,376 --> 01:22:45,888
Infowars

1810
01:22:46,144 --> 01:22:48,192
I wanted to cover this but I just don't even care

1811
01:22:48,448 --> 01:22:49,984
What are the fourth hours

1812
01:22:53,312 --> 01:22:56,896
And his entire segment was about silent weapon

1813
01:22:57,152 --> 01:22:57,920
For quiet Wars

1814
01:22:58,176 --> 01:22:58,944
Greyhounds like

1815
01:22:59,456 --> 01:22:59,968
Man

1816
01:23:00,736 --> 01:23:02,272
This is just a fake document

1817
01:23:02,528 --> 01:23:03,808
You're doing

1818
01:23:04,064 --> 01:23:04,832
An hour

1819
01:23:05,344 --> 01:23:09,696
About how silent weapons for quiet Wars relates to the covid conspiracy

1820
01:23:09,952 --> 01:23:10,464
Island

1821
01:23:10,720 --> 01:23:11,232
You didn't

1822
01:23:11,744 --> 01:23:12,768
Look at this

1823
01:23:13,024 --> 01:23:17,888
Care to ask yourself is this real real

1824
01:23:18,144 --> 01:23:19,168
Conspiracy worldview good

1825
01:23:20,192 --> 01:23:21,472
Workday

A quiet Wars great height on a great title

1830
01:23:31,456 --> 01:23:32,992
I'm not going to argue that

1831
01:23:34,272 --> 01:23:35,808
There is a problem

1832
01:23:36,064 --> 01:23:39,392
31 last this is where things get a little bit scary

1833
01:23:39,648 --> 01:23:41,184
And I do not like what's going on any

1834
01:23:41,952 --> 01:23:44,000
And I'll tell you more

1835
01:23:44,512 --> 01:23:45,280
Try to

1836
01:23:45,536 --> 01:23:48,352
Get advice from lawyers and people who know the law and I'm like look at

1837
01:23:48,608 --> 01:23:49,120
What point do the

1838
01:23:49,376 --> 01:23:50,144
The citizens have

1839
01:23:50,400 --> 01:23:50,912
The right

1840
01:23:51,680 --> 01:23:52,960
To take the law into their own hands

1841
01:23:53,984 --> 01:23:54,752
To do anything.

1842
01:23:55,264 --> 01:23:56,032
You know violet

1843
01:23:56,544 --> 01:23:57,824
But when am I allowed

1844
01:23:58,336 --> 01:23:59,104
To arrest

1845
01:23:59,872 --> 01:24:00,384
Adjudge

1846
01:24:00,640 --> 01:24:01,920
That is not upholding the law

1847
01:24:02,176 --> 01:24:04,224
When am I allowed to arrest

1848
01:24:05,248 --> 01:24:07,552
Police station that is not upholding the law

1849
01:24:07,808 --> 01:24:09,344

1851
01:24:10,624 --> 01:24:12,416
Check the law into our hands because nobody is

1852
01:24:12,928 --> 01:24:13,696
Nobody's Inn

1853
01:24:14,464 --> 01:24:14,976
Putting Justice

1854
01:24:15,744 --> 01:24:21,888
Holyshit

1855
01:24:22,912 --> 01:24:29,056
And you know what I would probably agree with that was Danny Rodriguez

1856
01:24:29,312 --> 01:24:32,896
You know you have the right side of certain points take the law into your own hands

1857
01:24:33,408 --> 01:24:34,944
You know maybe when you have nothing left to lose

1858
01:24:35,200 --> 01:24:36,736
I would say a lot of terrorists

1859
01:24:36,992 --> 01:24:41,856
Start from when you have nothing left to lose and you know what's interesting about people like this

1860
01:24:42,112 --> 01:24:44,928
Feel like I have nothing left to lose

1861
01:24:45,184 --> 01:24:46,720
And maybe they do something like

1862
01:24:46,976 --> 01:24:47,488
Taze a cop

1863
01:24:47,744 --> 01:24:53,888
Capital

1864
01:24:54,144 --> 01:24:59,008
It turns out I have a bank account on God

1865
01:24:59,264 --> 01:25:05,408
Pretending to have nothing to do you have family

1866
01:25:05,664 --> 01:25:11,808
These shity media sources that I was constantly

1867
01:25:12,320 --> 01:25:15,136
Convinced me that I had nothing to lose when in reality

1868
01:25:15,392 --> 01:25:17,952
Quite a bit

1869
01:25:18,208 --> 01:25:20,000
F*** you about the not violent thing

1870
01:25:20,256 --> 01:25:23,072
How do you think it's going to go with you try to arrest

1871
01:25:23,328 --> 01:25:24,352
The chief of police

1872
01:25:24,608 --> 01:25:27,680
You think you slick when can I peacefully

1873
01:25:27,936 --> 01:25:33,056
And here's the other question cuz I feel like this is the subtext to what he saying

1874
01:25:33,568 --> 01:25:35,104
When will the police chief

1875
01:25:35,360 --> 01:25:38,432
Recognize that I should be allowed to arrest him as well

1876
01:25:38,688 --> 01:25:40,480
What police chief

1877
01:25:40,736 --> 01:25:44,832
Well obviously

1878
01:25:45,088 --> 01:25:46,880
That's kind of the subjects

1879
01:25:47,136 --> 01:25:51,232
Never when will they realize LOL I'm obviously on the rug side

1880
01:25:51,488 --> 01:25:53,792

01:25:54,048 --> 01:25:56,096

01:25:56,352 --> 01:26:02,496
You can walk up and say that you are a bad judge maybe when you create overwhelming force that the police can't

1883
01:26:04,288 --> 01:26:05,312
I got a maybe but that's

1884
01:26:05,568 --> 01:26:06,336

Congratulate

1888
01:26:13,760 --> 01:26:16,576
These guys are really stupid conversations dumb

1889
01:26:18,112 --> 01:26:18,624
I guess

1890
01:26:19,392 --> 01:26:22,208

Things into your own hands

1896
01:26:35,776 --> 01:26:37,056
When you have nothing left to lose

1897
01:26:38,080 --> 01:26:43,456
I think I probably sounds great in like a movie trailer or something but not Infowars

1898
01:26:43,712 --> 01:26:46,784
