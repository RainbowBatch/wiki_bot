Indeed we are.

9
00:01:09,632 --> 00:01:10,912
Then I have a

10
00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:11,936
Quick question for you

11
00:01:12,192 --> 00:01:12,704

Deported from Australia

Trailer for the next 30 it maybe has died down but this

19
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,864
There's not going to be more trouble

20
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:42,656
Beyond that

21
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:48,800
The Australian Open has begun sure and all three of my rooting interest one with

22
00:01:49,056 --> 00:01:55,200
Djokovic out-of-the-way Rafa's got a real Clearpath the favorite

23
00:01:55,456 --> 00:01:56,992
This year I would say probably Medvedev

24
00:01:57,248 --> 00:02:02,112
Okay wait to present president

25
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:02,880

00:02:04,672 --> 00:02:05,952
Yeah I know but

27
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:07,744
He's got a good shot

28
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,328
Andy Murray old man Andy Murray is back

29
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:12,096
Exact

30
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:19,008
Exactly he hasn't been relevant for tennis in the past 10 years and he's back anyone last night as a wildcard

31
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:19,776
Incredible

32
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:24,384
And then Nick kyrgios is also he's still going along strong and I

33
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,176
Can't wait for him to put it all together

34
00:02:26,944 --> 00:02:29,760
Alright well

At the end of this episode

42
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:55,104
I knew about this thing

43
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:57,152
Episode

44
00:02:57,408 --> 00:02:58,176
I could not stop laughing

45
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,784
But first before

46
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,600

Accessbcc

60
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:13,440
What's today's episode

61
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:14,720
Is obvious that the play on

62
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:16,256
Seditious conspiracy

63
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:17,024
Sid Vicious

64
00:04:17,536 --> 00:04:18,047
Conspiracy

65
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:23,167
Dirty business

66
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:29,823
Where can I buy Funtime so I got to I got to thinking and wrestling with

67
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:31,359
Mention that there was an interview

68
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:33,919
But he did with Stewart Road Indian twas

69
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:34,687
Disaster

70
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:37,247
It's newer freaks out on him and so Alex never post

71
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:39,295
I was curious about

72
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:40,063
This

73
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:46,719
I knew that there had been a number of times that he'd come in and said like

74
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:48,511
Hey we got set up this way

75
00:04:48,767 --> 00:04:52,095
Was bulshit

76
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:53,375
Of those interviews that Alex

77
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:55,935
Misrepresent had put it out

78
00:04:56,447 --> 00:05:00,543
But it turned out that I'm banned. Video Alex posted this

79
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:02,079
Old interview that he had never

80
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:04,127
Shut up

81
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:05,407
Under the headline like

82
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:07,711
You can never buy me you can't

83
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:09,503
Talk me out of this you can't

84
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:15,903
Threaten me hopefully I'm Stewart Road close to that

85
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:17,183
I'm so I

86
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:18,207
It was like

87
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:20,255
This looks familiar to me too like

88
00:05:20,511 --> 00:05:21,023
It seems like

89
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:23,583
I've seen that before I'm not sure that I had

90
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:26,399
Watch it

91
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:28,191
I don't know

92
00:05:28,447 --> 00:05:30,239
Why Alex characterized it the way he

93
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:33,567
He did there's not really a fight and it or anything

94
00:05:33,823 --> 00:05:35,103
But I did find it in

95
00:05:35,359 --> 00:05:37,151
Interesting

96
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:37,919
2

97
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:38,687
Cover that

98
00:05:38,943 --> 00:05:39,711
For today's episode

99
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:40,479
And see where the

100
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:41,503
The mood took me

101
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:44,575
See where things went to be talkin about this interview

102
00:05:45,087 --> 00:05:47,135
Alex recorded on July 2nd

103
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:48,415
2021

104
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:54,559
And it was supposed to air on the 4th

105
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:55,583
Amanda never did

106
00:05:57,375 --> 00:06:01,471
Confirm because I went by check to the July 4th show and instead of an interview

107
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:03,263
Yeah Alex interviews judge

108
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:06,079
Joe Brown hey what's White

109
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:06,847
Can he do that

110
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:13,247
Youcam in the like a ton but every

111
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:18,367
Newsies showing up what a weird thing I had no idea was true

112
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:19,391
Exactly

113
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:22,207
Abso

114
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:23,487
Here's here's the thing

115
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:24,767
This point

116
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:26,303
An article had come out

117
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:27,327
About sewer

118
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:28,607
Calling him Buffet

119
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:30,655
The right-wing was

120
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:34,239
Like you're a goddamn thing cuz you haven't been arrested yet

121
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:36,287
Enter this is how Alex

122
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:37,567
Starts up

123
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:38,591
The interview

124
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:39,871
And starts up a conversation

125
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:42,431
Talk about this upstart

126
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:47,295
Stuart Rhodes is the founder of Okafor this 11 years ago

127
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:48,319
He's been quiet

128
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:49,087
In the spotlight

129
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:50,111
January 6th

130
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:51,135
Obviously

131
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:52,671
Before that

132
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:57,023
And I wanted to give him a chance to come on because we saw this revolver article

133
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:58,559
That came out

134
00:06:59,071 --> 00:06:59,583
Abased

135
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:01,119
We saying unindicted

136
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:02,911
Conspirators in 16 case

137
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:05,727
Raise disturbing questions of federal for knowledge

138
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:08,287
Thought that was a pretty important article because

139
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:09,567
Portland

140
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:10,847
Racketeering things

141
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:11,615
4

142
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:15,711
But then there's a new article out that a lot of questions about only Randolph Air

143
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:17,247
And that's

144
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:18,783
Story-based

145
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:19,807
Chipley well Federal

146
00:07:20,575 --> 00:07:22,623
Protection of old keeper Kingpin Stewart Road

147
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:25,183
Breaks the entire Capital insurrection

148
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:26,207
Lies

149
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:27,231
Wide open

150
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:30,815
So this rhubarb revolver article was one of the early attempt

151
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:33,119
Create the false flag narrative Atwood

152
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:34,655
Stick with the right with medic minute

153
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:36,447
I don't think it

154
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:37,215
Really

155
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:37,983
Totally work

156
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:39,007
Two things of evolved

157
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:46,431
It was an interesting first attempt given Ohio like what we seeing something but reading it does give you a sense of the sort of fact that they were rest

158
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:47,711
Slime with last June

159
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:52,319
And the end of July which they've essentially decided to all conveniently for

160
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:54,111
Forget since

161
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:58,719
Princeton this article points out that most of the attention in that media space

162
00:07:58,975 --> 00:07:59,487
Has been

163
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:02,815
60 Minutes erection

164
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:03,583
Because most

165
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:05,631
Most of the people who went into the capital for tourist

166
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:08,959
Like Maga moms who wandered a little further than they should have

167
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:14,591
However this article argues that they should start dealing with the reality that a separate group of folks

168
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:15,615
Were there and act

169
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:16,383
If that day

170
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:19,455
Up until now the overwhelming perhaps

171
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:23,551
Exclusive sharabi counter establishment reporting on 16 is focused on

172
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:24,831
Absolving the first

173
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:26,879
And this is a valuable thing

174
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:30,719
The notion that these harmless Maga mom's wandering around the capital word immense

175
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:32,767
The terrorist engaged interactionism

176
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:33,535
Absurd

177
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:37,887
However the possibility that the federal government had undercover operatives are informed

178
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:39,679
It's involved in the events of 16

179
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:40,447
Trump

180
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:41,471
Planning to text

181
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:42,751
Fusion compels us

182
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:44,031
To turn our attention to the second

183
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:44,799
Category 4

184
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:50,687
We're especially interested in the unindicted co-conspirators who belong to any of the big three militia

185
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:54,015
The Oath Keepers the proud boys in the 3 percenters

186
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:56,063
Indeed it is these militia

187
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:57,599
Two groups whose Behavior statements

188
00:08:57,855 --> 00:09:00,415
I'm planning leading up to and during 16

189
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:03,743
Most closely aligned with the violin insurrectionist

190
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:04,767

191
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:06,047
We hear about in the media

192
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:08,863
In which the government claims to have been going after and it's

193
00:09:09,119 --> 00:09:09,631
Its aggressive

194
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:10,399
Prosecution

195
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:13,471
Okay so the person who wrote this article has been killed

196
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:20,895
Actually it's actually Darren Beattie who is in Tucker Carlson Patriot first documentary

197
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:24,991
Get away with it

198
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:32,415
Personal articles fully aware of the fact that members of The Oath Keepers Cowboys in 3%

199
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:33,183
Implanting

200
00:09:33,439 --> 00:09:33,951
About doing it

201
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:34,975
Exactly what happened

202
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:39,327
And that fact is really inconvenient for the right-wing media that spent years

203
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:40,351
Protecting these group

204
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:43,935
And pretending that they're actually just the victims of antifa Newport

205
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:50,335
Protectors of Patriots didn't mean for you to do the things we told you to do

206
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:52,639
And we knew you were doing

207
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:57,503
In order to counter this problem it's essential to make the very obvious right-wing extremist

208
00:09:57,759 --> 00:09:58,527
Government operative

209
00:09:58,783 --> 00:09:59,807
It's doing a false flag

210
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:00,831
And at this point

211
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:02,111
At least revolver was

212
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:03,135
Totally willing

213
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:04,671
Throw folks like The Oath Keepers and

214
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:05,695
The proud boys under the bus

215
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:10,047
The reason to dightman's of Thomas Caldwell one of the oak

216
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:12,095
Keepers who is now charged along with Stewart

217
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:13,375
Conspiracy case

218
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:15,679
Including a couple of unnamed Coke and

219
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:16,447
Conspirators

220
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:19,263
It's a reason I mean recent

221
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:21,055
To this article

222
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:24,895
This article has decided to interpret

223
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:25,919
But people who are fat

224
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:28,735
In reality that's an honor

225
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:33,855
Conclusion because these co-conspirators May well have been on name because name and them could do damage

226
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:35,135
Do the building of another

227
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:36,159
More important

228
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:37,695
Possibly like a case

229
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:40,767
Charging Stewart with a seditious conspiracy

230
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:41,535
Anyway

231
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:46,911
In June 2021 there was at least some willingness on the part of the right-wing media to cut bait

232
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:48,191
With more extreme groups

233
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:50,239
In their ranks and portray them as feds

234
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:51,007
In order to save

235
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:53,055
This probably didn't

236
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:54,847
Stick because for a while

237
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:56,895
Didn't seem like any legal action was happy

238
00:10:57,663 --> 00:11:02,271
But he kind of died down and it didn't feel like there was any real need to throw these guys out after all

239
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:04,063
That was a huge mistake

240
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:05,343
Propaganda tactics

241
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:10,463
All these people knew damn well that the folks who were acting like military units in

242
00:11:10,719 --> 00:11:12,767
Storm the capital of where is there militia buddy

243
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:18,911
And they should have known that it was only a matter of time before that was going to come out and it's going to look really bad to be associated with

244
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:23,519
So the other article about Stewart being The Oath Keepers Kingpin is being

245
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:24,543
Protected by the feds

246
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:27,615
That's just another revolver article also written by darebee

247
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:31,455
It's a stupid article that's just based on the fact that Stewart hadn't been

248
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:36,319
Indicted yet which was probably the result of the investigator

249
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:38,879
So they wouldn't end up going off half-cocked

250
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:41,439
Charging a revolutionary minded militia leader

251
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:45,279
And then give him a massive propaganda Victory to use

252
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:46,047
Rally his arm

253
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:51,423
Turning him not just from martyr to Untouchable God hero that's

254
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:55,775
That's a good idea when you're dealing with someone like Stuart Rhodes you cannot miss

255
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:58,335
So it makes absolute sense the investigators would

256
00:11:58,591 --> 00:12:00,127
First prosecuted lower-level cases

257
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:01,663
Number to build the

258
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:02,687
Base they needed

259
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:03,455
The charge Stewart

260
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:06,527
And that's exactly what Attorney General

261
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:09,855
Amerit Garland said there was the doj strategy in his speech

262
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:10,623
Those commemorating

263
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:11,647
Anniversary

264
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:15,231
He said we watch The Wire recently and the guy said if you come at the

265
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:16,767
The king you best not miss and he's

266
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:17,535
Kingpins all week

267
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:20,863
Kind of just when you walk through the garden to go to wash your back

268
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:24,191
We build investigations by laying a foundation

269
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:26,239
We resolved more straightforward cases

270
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:30,591
Is first because they provide the evidentiary foundation for more complex cases

271
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:33,663
Investigating the moreover crimes generates link

272
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:34,943
Linkages the less OverWatch

273
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:39,551
Hobart actors on the evidence they provide can lead us to others

274
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:40,831
Sue may have been involved

275
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:42,111
And that evidence

276
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:43,135
Conservice the found a

277
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:45,439
A further investigative leads and techniques

278
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:46,975
Yeah you seem Law and Order

279
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:49,023
Basically exactly what was going on

280
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:51,839
Darren Beattie at revolver was doing exactly what

281
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:52,607
He should have

282
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:54,911
Been doing from a propaganda and cover-up respect

283
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:56,191
He was a temp

284
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:57,983
Please protect the larger right-wing Griffin

285
00:12:58,239 --> 00:12:59,007
Machine that relies on it

286
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:00,543
Inciting revolutionary feelings

287
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:01,567
By smearing

288
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:05,407
Disowning the people who actually followed through with those revolutionary feeling

289
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:06,943
So like

290
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:08,223
I think he was

291
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:11,039
Doing what he should have been doing and terms

292
00:13:11,295 --> 00:13:11,807
The scams

293
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:17,183
And all that people decided no

294
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:22,303
We prefer our Revolution that's why we're all here

295
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:24,095
Let's do this

296
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:28,447
It's a really interesting Dynamic to go back and look at to read those articles and be like

297
00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:31,007
Yeah y'all y'all should have

298
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:33,055
Like obviously Stewart Roads isn't

299
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:36,127
The FED but if that's what you need in order to

300
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:39,199
Extricate yourself from him at The Oath Keepers of The Proud boys

301
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:41,247
You should have done that right

302
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:43,551
If you if you're interested in maintaining

303
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:44,831
The business that you're doing

304
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:45,855
Right I mean

305
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:47,903
Just like we talked about

306
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:51,231
Less time with you they can only flourish in a stable cyst

307
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:52,255
And then

308
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:53,791
Because they create unseen

309
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:57,887
Instability they break down there on time trying to correct

310
00:13:58,143 --> 00:14:02,751
Executive create that table system Aaron Beatty is trying to right the ship

311
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:05,055
Eventually much smarter

312
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:06,591
I mean I don't want

313
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:12,991
He's dead now but it is what you would do if you were doing a better job

314
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:17,087
That is what you would do

315
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:17,855
More or less

316
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:23,231
Very happy about one particular per

317
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:25,279
Thanks for joining

318
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:27,583
Yeah thank you and I want to

319
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:29,375
Give a shout out to Harrison Smith

320
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:31,935
Awesome Porter there yesterday

321
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:33,215
Play pretty-much dismantle

322
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:36,287
The revolver headpiece on me and called it what it is

323
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:39,103
Do deaf amateur earpiece

324
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:43,455
He went through it paragraph by paragraph on the American Journal of the great job

325
00:14:43,711 --> 00:14:44,479
Way2go Harrison

326
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:47,039
Man a lot of stuff

327
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:49,343
You say in retrospect about Harrison Smith

328
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:51,903
Always just makes me think

329
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:54,719
The capital Has Fallen

330
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:56,511
Can I watch

331
00:14:56,767 --> 00:14:58,559
The videos of Harrison

332
00:14:58,815 --> 00:14:59,327

Vespa

334
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:03,423
The video debunking the revolver

335
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:07,775
I'm going over but I don't care

336
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:10,847
Another video

337
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:14,431
Stewart got arrested

338
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:15,199
No

339
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:19,295
He he was doing it out to disprove he's not a fat now kind of thing

340
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:26,719
One of the things that I video is he pretending he wasn't on air on January 6th

341
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:28,511
The Patriots

342
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:31,327
Really weird mean

343
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:33,119
That's just one of those things that should

344
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:42,335
You own that what you wear it like a badge on your chest

345
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:46,175
Fallen quote me

So

Is the temperature here

350
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:55,391
But honestly like he can laugh at all

351
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:57,439
But also he's going to sue

352
00:15:59,231 --> 00:16:00,255
It's a pathetic

00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:09,375
So yeah this is so hard.

375
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:10,655
You can't

376
00:17:10,911 --> 00:17:11,679
Give me the

377
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:13,215
Two position of

378
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:15,519
Literally in

379
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:16,799
Jail for sedition

380
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:17,823
Screaming

381
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:23,455
I love my country so much there's nothing I wouldn't do for my country

382
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:28,319
Exactly what they think that's how they think

383
00:17:28,575 --> 00:17:34,207
Yeah but they're dedicated Stewart is dedicated to his country but his

384
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:40,863
Is country is only a conception that existing is mine and it is not the share reality that we all have

385
00:17:41,119 --> 00:17:42,143
How are government and civics

386
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:46,239
He's hostile to that his country

387
00:17:48,287 --> 00:17:49,311
Bucking Pete Santilli

388
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:55,967
He's a radio host

389
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:58,527
Who was also at

390
00:17:58,783 --> 00:18:04,159
Do you like the Bundy Ranch and at the mouth of the occupation there

391
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:07,999
I believe it was at the one that he getting arrested

392
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:08,767
Dino Charge

393
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:10,047
NFL getting dropped

394
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:15,935
Sure that's where the big feather in the the Santilli cap are looking at the length

395
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:17,727
The time it took to get to Stewart Road

396
00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:22,335
This because they f***** up the Bundy s*** so incredibly badly

397
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:23,871
It seems like

398
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:26,431
You could have you could have maybe arrested

399
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:27,199
In-store backpack

400
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:30,271
I'm probably I don't know

401
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:31,039
Again

402
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:31,807
Important

403
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:33,599
To go off half-cocked

404
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:34,879
With revolutionary

405
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:36,671
Butts

406
00:18:36,927 --> 00:18:38,207
Talked a little bit here about his beef

407
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:39,231
Pizza antille

408
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:43,583
Drill into all this past stuff on the ranch

409
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:44,351
Impastor

410
00:18:46,399 --> 00:18:47,423
You are a refuge

411
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:48,191
But just

412
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:50,751
Kylian

413
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:53,311
Because I think he was set up by the fence I got out of jail

414
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:55,615
What is the issue between you and Pete Santilli

415
00:18:56,383 --> 00:19:00,223
Well for one I opposed

416
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:02,527
A dozen

417
00:19:02,783 --> 00:19:03,807
Walking tours were there

418
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:07,647
And before Amity even did it

419
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:14,047
Who's actually good point to bring up which is a good indication that store probably actually has a track record of

420
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:15,583
Thinking for himself and making

421
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:22,751
You might think it's someone like the head of the Oath Keepers of being favor of every single right-wing cause celeb but that's not actually true

422
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:26,847
Stewart he was in favor of any took part in the

423
00:19:27,103 --> 00:19:28,895
Bundy Ranch standoff in 2014

424
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:30,175
But he was very

425
00:19:30,431 --> 00:19:32,223
Critical of the malheur Wildlife Refuge

426
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:32,991
Standoff

427
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:37,343
Initially he didn't want The Oath Keepers get involved it all ain't thought that it was

428
00:19:37,599 --> 00:19:40,415
The fight that was worth their time or even had like a righteous cause

429
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:43,999
Let's do it but eventually he did give in and he said quote

430
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:48,863
And oathkeeper team to Oregon albeit without long guns or camouflage gear and only

431
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:49,631
To quote

432
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:50,399
Keep the peace

433
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:51,679
Great I mean

434
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:53,215
Just just

435
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:53,983
So

436
00:19:54,495 --> 00:19:55,007
Kind of

437
00:19:55,263 --> 00:19:56,287
That's what I think

438
00:19:57,055 --> 00:20:01,407
Pete Santilli was deep in the malware game so this could explain some of the tension

439
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:05,503
Between him and Stuart but if you look a little bit deeper that. Around the mouth

440
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:08,319
Patient you begin to see some real disillusionment with

441
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:10,367
Stewart as the head of the organization

442
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:11,903
And some of it did involve

443
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:12,671
Pete Santilli

444
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:17,023
Store was not a very popular guy after some of the events at the Bundy Ranch

445
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:18,047
Bunkerville

446
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:19,071
He called it

447
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:22,399
It's easy to remember the key in The Oath Keepers were there

448
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:25,471
But it's less well remembered how they ended up leaving

449
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:28,287
German article by the splc quote

450
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:32,127
In May 2014 The Oath Keepers were fixture at Cliven Bundy

451
00:20:32,383 --> 00:20:32,895
These cattle ranch

452
00:20:33,151 --> 00:20:33,663
Did Nevada

453
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:34,687
And tell Road

454
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:36,479
Claimed to have received intelligence

455
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:38,015
Have an imminent drone

456
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:39,295
And respond

457
00:20:39,551 --> 00:20:42,623
Multipool do Keepers out of what he called the Killzone

458
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:44,671
Would you let other militia Matt at the camp

459
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:47,743
To talk openly about shooting roads for desertion

460
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:52,607
In the end they voted unanimously to announce The Oath Keepers and the Drone strike never came

461
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:58,239
Rhodes was a bit humiliated and he lay low for a bit but popped up after that to the shooting

462
00:20:58,495 --> 00:21:00,543
15 or 5

463
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:02,079
Police officers were shot

464
00:21:03,615 --> 00:21:04,383
Stewart re-emerged

465
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:05,663
Pissed off

466
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:06,431
Some people

467
00:21:06,687 --> 00:21:11,551
Susan delemus the wife of an oath keeper who was it Bunkerville wrote an article titled quote

468
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:14,879
New Roads comes out of hiding and that has the nerve to ask

469
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:16,159
Will you take up arms

470
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:16,928
The fight marks

471
00:21:17,184 --> 00:21:17,696
Is Terrorism

472
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:21,024
This article was published and was spread wide by

473
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,048
Pete Santilli

474
00:21:22,304 --> 00:21:23,328
So it seems like this be

475
00:21:23,584 --> 00:21:24,352
With them

476
00:21:24,608 --> 00:21:27,680
Predates males wearing have something to do with it

477
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:31,520
In the intervening years there have been some of keeper cells that have broken

478
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:32,288
With a national or

479
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:33,056
Organization

480
00:21:33,312 --> 00:21:34,592
Specifically because of a disc

481
00:21:34,848 --> 00:21:35,616
Trust with Stewart

482
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:38,432
There was a cell in Josephine County Oregon

483
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:39,456
Who carried office

484
00:21:39,712 --> 00:21:40,224
Successful

485
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,504
And far less publicized

486
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,040
Turn off of law enforcement

487
00:21:43,296 --> 00:21:44,576
Happy Sugar Pine mine

488
00:21:45,088 --> 00:21:46,368
And they kind of had a

489
00:21:47,136 --> 00:21:49,440
Their local Leader Joseph Rice said quote

490
00:21:49,696 --> 00:21:51,488
We have flag rank officers and

491
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:57,376
Senior officers military retired that have made the statement that they would not join the group as long as Stewart Road

492
00:21:57,632 --> 00:21:58,144
Wasn't charged

493
00:21:58,656 --> 00:22:00,704
Stuart is not a leader he has no leadership

494
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:01,984
Ability he's self

495
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:02,752
Remotes

496
00:22:03,264 --> 00:22:05,056
Rice would also say quote like a moth

497
00:22:05,312 --> 00:22:07,872
To the flame he flies in throws up a PayPal

498
00:22:08,128 --> 00:22:08,896
And then disappears

499
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:14,272
What are the big issues do with it this group E of the from Josephine County Oregon

500
00:22:14,528 --> 00:22:15,040
Is the

501
00:22:15,296 --> 00:22:16,320
Because they

502
00:22:16,576 --> 00:22:20,416
Lychee used what they had set out to with the

503
00:22:23,232 --> 00:22:24,768
This was used as a jacket

504
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,304
Giant marketing

505
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:27,584
Peace for the oak

506
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:31,168
Deeper life is like this is the kind of successes we have

507
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:32,192
Where I believe

508
00:22:32,704 --> 00:22:33,984
The people on the local tip

509
00:22:34,496 --> 00:22:35,776
Didn't feel like the National Organ

510
00:22:36,032 --> 00:22:37,568
Renovation really was responsible

511
00:22:37,824 --> 00:22:39,872
For the success that they had while we're trying to

512
00:22:40,128 --> 00:22:41,408
To take credit for all right

513
00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:44,992
In the stretch between Vacaville and Mal who are there

514
00:22:45,248 --> 00:22:46,272
Dissension in the ranks

515
00:22:46,528 --> 00:22:48,320
It's related to Stewart's ability as a leader

516
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:50,880
And a bit of this was publicized by Pete Santilli

517
00:22:51,648 --> 00:22:56,000
And then Santilli was there at malgor and even got arrested there whilst or dad to go back

518
00:22:56,512 --> 00:22:57,792
What is initial position to knock

519
00:22:58,048 --> 00:22:59,328
Get involved by sending smoke

520
00:22:59,584 --> 00:23:00,096
Keepers in after

521
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,912
Books like Stuart are basically on Ableton

522
00:23:03,168 --> 00:23:05,728
Accept personal responsibilities

523
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:08,032
Eat or somehow those bad times

524
00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:10,336
What happened in the damage they did to his

525
00:23:10,592 --> 00:23:11,104
Mutation

526
00:23:11,616 --> 00:23:13,920
I would say that hopefully getting arrested for sedition

527
00:23:14,176 --> 00:23:14,944
Conspiracy help store

528
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:15,712
Get some of this

529
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:21,344
Pizza Philly did ya

530
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,112
Is

531
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:24,160
The terrorist crab

532
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:24,928
That is kind

533
00:23:25,184 --> 00:23:27,488
The funny thing about having a leaderless resistance

534
00:23:27,744 --> 00:23:29,280
Senses that your local leader would like to

535
00:23:29,536 --> 00:23:30,560
Credit for his s***

536
00:23:31,072 --> 00:23:32,352
And the national leader can go f******

537
00:23:32,864 --> 00:23:34,144
I would argue that

538
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:37,472
Maybe the local leader just doesn't want the national L take

539
00:23:37,728 --> 00:23:38,240
Taking credit

540
00:23:38,496 --> 00:23:39,264
Well know for sure

541
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,056
You could you can imagine

542
00:23:41,312 --> 00:23:42,848
Not knowing anything about

543
00:23:43,104 --> 00:23:43,872
The guy who was the local

544
00:23:44,384 --> 00:23:45,152
Perhaps

545
00:23:45,664 --> 00:23:48,480
He was more interested in the solidarity of his people

546
00:23:48,736 --> 00:23:49,504
Oh he's holding

547
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:52,832
Maybe

548
00:23:56,928 --> 00:23:59,232
I don't know anyway the point is that people didn't like

549
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:01,280
Stewart that much after the Bundy Ranch

550
00:24:01,792 --> 00:24:03,328
It's weird cuz they are old

551
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:04,608
Cosplaying but

552
00:24:04,864 --> 00:24:05,376
To varying

553
00:24:05,632 --> 00:24:08,704
Degrees in some of these people really are f******

554
00:24:09,216 --> 00:24:12,288
Straight up retired military with a a

555
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,080
Intense amount of ability

556
00:24:14,336 --> 00:24:19,200
Youtrading another bunch of these guys are just assholes who on the weekends have a long gun

557
00:24:19,968 --> 00:24:20,480
It's crazy

558
00:24:20,736 --> 00:24:22,016
I need some of that bar business

559
00:24:22,272 --> 00:24:25,600
People are they're just they're just got to own a f****** tire shop

560
00:24:25,856 --> 00:24:32,000
No I mean Stewart's kind of a businessman kind of a

561
00:24:32,256 --> 00:24:34,560
It's like they started the KKK all over again

562
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:37,888
The dues the f

563
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:46,848
The merch recruit other people in order that yeah yeah the whole thing

564
00:24:47,104 --> 00:24:49,408
So bookstore didn't want people to go in

565
00:24:50,176 --> 00:24:50,944
Capital

566
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:51,712
Chicago victim

567
00:24:51,968 --> 00:24:52,992
If you really think about it

568
00:24:55,552 --> 00:24:57,344
Of January 6th I know for damn sure

569
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,112
I didn't want

570
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:00,672
Investigation

571
00:25:02,464 --> 00:25:03,232
I did not want that.

572
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:07,328
What is your position on January 6th and

573
00:25:08,352 --> 00:25:10,400
I've been through this before the same thing

574
00:25:13,216 --> 00:25:14,240
And we all go

575
00:25:14,496 --> 00:25:16,288
Caught off guard we all got suckered in

576
00:25:16,544 --> 00:25:18,592
Were there bucket or is there no doubt about it

577
00:25:22,176 --> 00:25:23,968
Target of the DHHS

578
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,248
Boj

579
00:25:25,504 --> 00:25:26,528
We're doing everything I can

580
00:25:28,576 --> 00:25:29,856
Victim I'm a Target

581
00:25:30,624 --> 00:25:31,648
And you know.

582
00:25:33,696 --> 00:25:34,720
That's supposed

583
00:25:35,488 --> 00:25:36,000
Yeah and I

584
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:39,840
But I honestly probably work

585
00:25:40,864 --> 00:25:41,888
The disappointing

586
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,448
As long as information isn't

587
00:25:44,704 --> 00:25:46,240
Really it's not a long-term

588
00:25:46,496 --> 00:25:47,264
Strategy

589
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,312
No it's it's sort of a Band-Aid

590
00:25:50,848 --> 00:25:52,384
We do he's doing his best to can

591
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:53,920
Knowing that like

592
00:25:54,944 --> 00:26:00,064
Salman I smoke come out and be like hey I was the one who led the fucken assault on the Kappa

593
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:00,832
How do I get that

594
00:26:02,624 --> 00:26:03,392
I think of you can't

595
00:26:03,648 --> 00:26:04,416
Just be like

596
00:26:05,184 --> 00:26:08,000
Suck my guys

597
00:26:08,256 --> 00:26:12,864
So anyway looked Keepers were there under official auspice

598
00:26:13,888 --> 00:26:15,936
And we stand for the Constitution always have

599
00:26:16,448 --> 00:26:20,800
And we were protecting people on January 6th Matthew van as we have done in the prior

600
00:26:21,056 --> 00:26:24,128
Stop a seal Rally's in in November and December in Atlanta

601
00:26:24,384 --> 00:26:25,408
Have you done for the entire

602
00:26:25,664 --> 00:26:26,432
Ministration

603
00:26:26,688 --> 00:26:27,712
Minimum Street Wichita

604
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:30,528
And speakers and the best

605
00:26:32,832 --> 00:26:33,600
And I'm not for sale

606
00:26:34,112 --> 00:26:34,880
You can't buy me

607
00:26:35,648 --> 00:26:36,416
Blackmail me

608
00:26:36,672 --> 00:26:38,464
You can intimidate me or shut me up

609
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:41,024
Melissa put me behind bars or

610
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:41,792
Scrap

611
00:26:42,048 --> 00:26:43,072
Destroy my character

612
00:26:43,328 --> 00:26:43,840
IPad new

613
00:26:44,864 --> 00:26:46,656
Nearby bars

614
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:50,240
I'm going to guarantee they destroy your character as well

615
00:26:50,496 --> 00:26:53,312
I think I think that he might be able to

616
00:26:53,568 --> 00:26:54,080
To get lucky

617
00:26:54,592 --> 00:26:55,360
And go to prison for the rest

618
00:26:55,616 --> 00:26:57,920
His life and become a patriot hero

619
00:26:58,176 --> 00:27:01,760
That's maybe the best outcome for him in terms of like

620
00:27:02,272 --> 00:27:03,552
Moving forward

621
00:27:05,088 --> 00:27:05,856
Somehow like

622
00:27:06,112 --> 00:27:07,904
Getting off

623
00:27:08,416 --> 00:27:10,976
I don't I don't imagine the paper World trusting him ever again

624
00:27:11,232 --> 00:27:12,512
No I don't

625
00:27:12,768 --> 00:27:14,816
Also want to live in a world where

626
00:27:15,072 --> 00:27:16,352
30 years from now

627
00:27:16,608 --> 00:27:18,912
F****** Stewart Roads is though

628
00:27:19,168 --> 00:27:20,192
White nationalist Mandela

629
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:21,984
Getting out of a

630
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:22,752
F****** right

631
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:25,568
Yeah I don't like it all

632
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:26,592
I don't

633
00:27:26,848 --> 00:27:29,408
Steve

634
00:27:30,176 --> 00:27:31,456
Watching this and watching some of

635
00:27:31,712 --> 00:27:33,248
The other interviews that he's done

636
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:36,064
There are some where he's at the eyepatch

637
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,088
Somewhere he doesn't

638
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,136
And there's a striking difference in the tone

639
00:27:40,928 --> 00:27:44,256
He does not seem nearly as scary when he's doesn't have his eyepatch

640
00:27:44,768 --> 00:27:46,304
Like what is a

641
00:27:46,816 --> 00:27:47,840
Huge element

642
00:27:48,096 --> 00:27:48,608
Of his present a

643
00:27:48,864 --> 00:27:50,912
I mean an eyepatch really does do it though

644
00:27:52,448 --> 00:27:53,472
If you've got the courage

645
00:27:53,728 --> 00:27:56,800
Words to just wear an eyepatch all the time the remarkably menacing

646
00:27:59,104 --> 00:27:59,872
Dictation

647
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,688
A other choices you can make

648
00:28:02,944 --> 00:28:03,456
Eyepatch

649
00:28:03,712 --> 00:28:08,576
Justin the one he uses

650
00:28:08,832 --> 00:28:09,344
Nice people

651
00:28:10,112 --> 00:28:10,880
So

652
00:28:11,136 --> 00:28:11,904
Houses like a man

653
00:28:12,928 --> 00:28:13,440
Hey man

654
00:28:13,696 --> 00:28:15,232
I know he's not doing the family

655
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:19,584
Hey we knew each other

656
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:20,352
Like a long time

657
00:28:21,888 --> 00:28:25,472
Keepers I was interviewing you back

658
00:28:27,264 --> 00:28:28,544
I've only known you because of you.

659
00:28:29,312 --> 00:28:31,616
Wanted to get Stewart Roads on rug

660
00:28:32,128 --> 00:28:32,640
Because

661
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,456
Text Giordano stork for I don't know

662
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,272
How long ago was the Stewart that you are

663
00:28:38,528 --> 00:28:39,808
Working with

664
00:28:40,064 --> 00:28:41,088
Congressman Ron Paul because

665
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,880
That's how long I've been interviewing you

666
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:46,208
1990 899

667
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:50,304
So but I don't think you and I

668
00:28:52,608 --> 00:28:57,472
2009 star Troopers me.

669
00:28:58,496 --> 00:29:00,288
What were you doing in between working

670
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,080
Photographer Paul and

671
00:29:02,336 --> 00:29:02,848
Okay bro

672
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:06,432
Wasco

673
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:09,248
I just remembered having you on before us

674
00:29:09,504 --> 00:29:10,528
Keeper Dumber you founding out

675
00:29:11,296 --> 00:29:14,624
Confused because Stewart did start coming on Infowars

676
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:17,440
Just before The Oath Keepers existed but

677
00:29:17,696 --> 00:29:18,720
Is really close

678
00:29:19,232 --> 00:29:21,024
His first appearance Alex was on April 8th

679
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:22,816
It's 2009 and it was

680
00:29:23,072 --> 00:29:24,864
Kind of predicated on the idea that

681
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:27,680
He was a former Ron Paul staffer who was part of the ascent

682
00:29:27,936 --> 00:29:28,448
50 party

683
00:29:28,704 --> 00:29:30,752
And he was talking a whole bunch about Revolution

684
00:29:31,264 --> 00:29:33,312
This is clearly an attempt to obscure its part to do so

685
00:29:33,568 --> 00:29:34,592
The preemptive advertising

686
00:29:34,848 --> 00:29:36,128
Because on April 19th

687
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,408
Patriots Day

688
00:29:37,664 --> 00:29:38,688
He gave a speech and Alexa

689
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:39,968
Canton Massachusetts announce

690
00:29:40,224 --> 00:29:40,736
Sigelei formation

691
00:29:40,992 --> 00:29:41,504
None of the Oath Keepers

692
00:29:42,016 --> 00:29:43,552
I need B on with Alex

693
00:29:43,808 --> 00:29:44,320
Twice

694
00:29:44,576 --> 00:29:45,600
Between April 8th

695
00:29:45,856 --> 00:29:46,880
And the actual amounts

696
00:29:47,136 --> 00:29:47,648
Are like

697
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,440
Are you was clearly doing some

698
00:29:51,744 --> 00:29:53,280
This is why Alex thinks that he was talking

699
00:29:55,584 --> 00:29:58,144
Alex does remember the formation of The Oath Keepers happening

700
00:29:59,424 --> 00:30:00,704
Doing it but the relationship

701
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:03,008
They had barely predated that at all

702
00:30:03,264 --> 00:30:04,032
And it

703
00:30:04,544 --> 00:30:05,312
Pretty clear that

704
00:30:05,568 --> 00:30:06,592
Stewart's that we contact

705
00:30:06,848 --> 00:30:08,128
Did you

706
00:30:08,384 --> 00:30:12,480
It's because maybe a press release they like hey I'm getting ready to start up here on Military

707
00:30:14,016 --> 00:30:17,088
Get on the ground floor of this forgotten

708
00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:20,928
Point

709
00:30:21,184 --> 00:30:22,208
I think you could

710
00:30:22,464 --> 00:30:23,488
Argue is a little bit

711
00:30:24,256 --> 00:30:24,768
Between the two of them

712
00:30:25,536 --> 00:30:27,840
Alex is trying to ask Stewart

713
00:30:28,096 --> 00:30:28,608
Questions

714
00:30:28,864 --> 00:30:30,400
From BT's article

715
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:32,192
And Stuart seems to think

716
00:30:32,704 --> 00:30:33,472
That Alex is to

717
00:30:33,728 --> 00:30:35,520
Suggesting these things

718
00:30:36,032 --> 00:30:37,568
There is a little bit of a misc

719
00:30:37,824 --> 00:30:38,592
Communication between

720
00:30:38,848 --> 00:30:39,360
The two

721
00:30:39,616 --> 00:30:42,432
Answer like a try to give you a chance to respond

722
00:30:44,736 --> 00:30:48,320
Little bit of that

723
00:30:48,576 --> 00:30:50,112
It's not that aggressive

724
00:30:50,624 --> 00:30:51,392
And it resolves

725
00:30:51,648 --> 00:30:52,672
Excel fairly well

726
00:30:52,928 --> 00:30:54,208
Hey what's up miscommunication

727
00:30:54,464 --> 00:30:56,768
Minutes into a 40-minute interview

728
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:58,048
Like it goes on

729
00:30:58,304 --> 00:30:59,328
So like

730
00:30:59,584 --> 00:31:01,888
But here's a little piece of it that I thought was particularly at

731
00:31:03,168 --> 00:31:06,752
According to the indictment you were having a 5 minute 25 second phone call

732
00:31:07,264 --> 00:31:09,824
What person can stating at 2:31 p.m.

733
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,872
Which overlaps with a precise minutes

734
00:31:12,128 --> 00:31:13,664
No Keepers got the Moltres

735
00:31:14,432 --> 00:31:15,456
Formation in just minutes

736
00:31:15,968 --> 00:31:19,296
Later went up to the capital given that you were the head of the Oath Keepers

737
00:31:20,064 --> 00:31:22,624
A person 10 was your ground Commander that day

738
00:31:23,136 --> 00:31:25,440
How could you be having almost respond

739
00:31:25,696 --> 00:31:26,208
Almost

740
00:31:26,464 --> 00:31:27,232
1/2 minute

741
00:31:27,488 --> 00:31:28,256
Phone call

742
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:30,048
Whitewall your troops

743
00:31:30,304 --> 00:31:31,840
Are lining up in the formation

744
00:31:32,096 --> 00:31:34,144
I know that they were lining up

745
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:35,424
The formation to do

746
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:37,728
What did you talk about 45 minutes 25 seconds

747
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:40,544
What's your ground operations Commander while they were forming

748
00:31:41,824 --> 00:31:43,360
Questions on the internet

749
00:31:43,872 --> 00:31:45,152
They put out saying

750
00:31:46,176 --> 00:31:47,712
If this guy's indicted

751
00:31:48,224 --> 00:31:49,248
Talking to you

752
00:31:49,504 --> 00:31:52,064
Then how have you not been indicted and I don't give him a chance to respond

753
00:31:53,088 --> 00:31:54,112
Whip has not been indicted

754
00:31:56,928 --> 00:31:58,208
Operation Chimera that day

755
00:32:04,096 --> 00:32:04,864
I'm just sitting here

756
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:08,448
Going all these articles in the questions because I'm actually trying to get you to respond to these

757
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,752
You don't respond it was

758
00:32:11,008 --> 00:32:12,288
Horrible reception

759
00:32:12,544 --> 00:32:14,080
Trying to reach each other

760
00:32:14,592 --> 00:32:15,104
In a massive

761
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:16,896
You were there you know

762
00:32:17,408 --> 00:32:18,944
You can't hear a damn thing

763
00:32:19,712 --> 00:32:22,272
Spotty reception desk

764
00:32:22,784 --> 00:32:23,296
Pause.

765
00:32:23,552 --> 00:32:24,576
So I don't believe that

766
00:32:24,832 --> 00:32:27,392
But Stewart is actually right about the bigger picture

767
00:32:27,648 --> 00:32:29,696
The person that you was on the phone with at 2:30

768
00:32:29,952 --> 00:32:31,232
2 p.m. on January 6th

769
00:32:31,744 --> 00:32:32,768
Hadn't been indicted

770
00:32:33,024 --> 00:32:34,048
And he's still

771
00:32:34,304 --> 00:32:35,072
Haven't been indicted

772
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:41,472
Give me a diaper for Stewart and his associates this person is just referred to as quote a person whom Road 2.0

773
00:32:41,728 --> 00:32:42,496
Did as the operation

774
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:43,776
Leader for January

775
00:32:44,544 --> 00:32:45,568
This person is Mike

776
00:32:45,824 --> 00:32:46,592
Wixom

777
00:32:47,616 --> 00:32:51,712
There's a very good chance that Simmons hasn't been indicted yet because he's going to be facing

778
00:32:51,968 --> 00:32:54,016
Can even more specific charge due to

779
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:55,040
Personally took

780
00:32:55,552 --> 00:32:57,600
Or possibly he's a cooperating with

781
00:32:57,856 --> 00:32:58,368
Miss at this point

782
00:32:58,624 --> 00:32:59,392
He's going to be charged

783
00:32:59,648 --> 00:33:00,928
With a lesser crime down the road

784
00:33:01,184 --> 00:33:01,696
Or he

785
00:33:03,744 --> 00:33:04,512
No

786
00:33:04,768 --> 00:33:07,840
The most terrifying Prospect for someone like Alex is a third option

787
00:33:08,608 --> 00:33:10,400
It's entirely possible that Simmons

788
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:11,424
Hasn't been charged

789
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:12,704
Because he's connected

790
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:13,472
The other

791
00:33:13,728 --> 00:33:16,032
Allegations that are ongoing and they don't want to pounce

792
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:19,360
Because doing so could jeopardize those other

793
00:33:20,384 --> 00:33:25,504
A possibly relevant detail that is that along with being Stewart's operations leader on the ground

794
00:33:26,016 --> 00:33:27,296
Simmons was also providing

795
00:33:27,552 --> 00:33:28,320
Security for Rodger

796
00:33:28,576 --> 00:33:29,856
Stone that weekend

797
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:34,720
Zero chance he hasn't been indicted yet because Simmons could be

798
00:33:34,976 --> 00:33:35,488
Be seen as a witness

799
00:33:35,744 --> 00:33:39,328
Send the case against Rodger or possibly that he seen is connective tissue

800
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:41,120
Between the road seditious

801
00:33:41,376 --> 00:33:41,888
Conspiracy

802
00:33:42,144 --> 00:33:45,216
And a circle that includes Rodger and Alex and Ali Alexander

803
00:33:45,472 --> 00:33:46,240
Stop the steel rail

804
00:33:47,264 --> 00:33:49,824
This is all conjecture and it may not be the case but

805
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:52,128
It seems like if you're someone like Alex or Ally

806
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:56,224
The fact that Simmons hasn't been indicted or named at this indictment should be a Cause

807
00:33:57,248 --> 00:33:58,272
That would really worry me

808
00:33:58,784 --> 00:33:59,552
Yeah if

809
00:33:59,808 --> 00:34:01,856
The indictment includes so many

810
00:34:02,112 --> 00:34:05,696
Communications between Stuart and everybody

811
00:34:06,208 --> 00:34:08,000
And this guy was in on those

812
00:34:08,256 --> 00:34:08,768
Communication

813
00:34:09,024 --> 00:34:09,792
He's he's

814
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:13,888
Communications with him are in the indictment

815
00:34:14,144 --> 00:34:14,656
Exact

816
00:34:15,168 --> 00:34:15,936
Yeah and

817
00:34:16,192 --> 00:34:17,728
And he was at this high of 11

818
00:34:17,984 --> 00:34:19,008
He was the operations

819
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:20,032
Commander

820
00:34:20,288 --> 00:34:22,080
We're not f****** around with this

821
00:34:22,336 --> 00:34:24,128
This dude is not just going to be okay

822
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:30,784
And everybody else is going to look at a movie like what if your role is

823
00:34:31,296 --> 00:34:31,808
To provide

824
00:34:32,064 --> 00:34:33,088
Security for people

825
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:37,440
You have a lot of people who could do that other than your operations Commander

826
00:34:37,952 --> 00:34:40,512
The operations Commander for

827
00:34:40,768 --> 00:34:41,536
This big

828
00:34:41,792 --> 00:34:43,328
Event

829
00:34:43,584 --> 00:34:44,608
Aunt is also providing

830
00:34:44,864 --> 00:34:46,144
Security for Rodger Stone

831
00:34:46,656 --> 00:34:47,424
Like his photograph

832
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:48,704
With Rodger

833
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:51,008
Is a little bit dicey

834
00:34:51,264 --> 00:34:53,824
Well I mean you could argue that maybe

835
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:54,592
Providing

836
00:34:54,848 --> 00:34:59,712
Security and also being in contact with Rodger Stone while you're in contact with the p

837
00:34:59,968 --> 00:35:03,296
People that your operations running at the same time I mean

838
00:35:03,552 --> 00:35:04,576
That might be bad

839
00:35:04,832 --> 00:35:06,624
I think there's a lot of possibilities

840
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:10,464
The come up there and the thoughts of what it could imply

841
00:35:11,232 --> 00:35:12,256
Are none of them are good

842
00:35:12,512 --> 00:35:13,536
Call Alex and his home

843
00:35:13,792 --> 00:35:15,072
World of cronies

844
00:35:15,584 --> 00:35:18,144
They got of it

845
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:18,912
Somebody

846
00:35:19,424 --> 00:35:21,216
Somebody get Rodger Stone on

847
00:35:21,472 --> 00:35:21,984
Anything

848
00:35:22,496 --> 00:35:23,264
We've already

849
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,056
He got away with it

850
00:35:25,312 --> 00:35:26,080
What do we have

851
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:28,896
Oh you just have to

852
00:35:29,152 --> 00:35:30,176
And the charge stick

853
00:35:30,432 --> 00:35:33,504
When you can't get apartment

854
00:35:34,528 --> 00:35:35,040
Jesus

855
00:35:37,856 --> 00:35:40,160
Provocateur on January 6th

856
00:35:40,928 --> 00:35:42,208
The globalist were wanting a day

857
00:35:50,144 --> 00:35:50,912
Trying to

858
00:35:51,168 --> 00:35:53,216
Sparking Insurrection Idaho rifle

859
00:35:53,728 --> 00:35:57,824
Actually trying to provoke my guys do things are illegal

860
00:35:58,080 --> 00:36:00,128
I told him to bring guns in a da

861
00:36:01,408 --> 00:36:03,712
Don't bring anything illegal in d.c.

862
00:36:03,968 --> 00:36:05,248
A warning

863
00:36:07,296 --> 00:36:07,808
Opera

864
00:36:08,832 --> 00:36:10,368
I can get you snared in d.c.

865
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:11,904
Is complete garbage

866
00:36:12,416 --> 00:36:13,952
It starts playing little fast

867
00:36:14,208 --> 00:36:15,488
Loose with the truth here haha

868
00:36:15,744 --> 00:36:21,632
He may not have wanted is Okie Brigade be arm the whole time but he also was an active participant in the creation of weapon

869
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:23,680
Cash is just outside DC

870
00:36:23,936 --> 00:36:24,448
Work react

871
00:36:24,704 --> 00:36:27,520
Action forces could be deployed to bring them in and you know

872
00:36:27,776 --> 00:36:30,080
Bring them to his housekeeper birthday to shake out hot

873
00:36:30,848 --> 00:36:34,176
He texted we will have a QRS

874
00:36:34,432 --> 00:36:35,456
The situation calls for

875
00:36:36,224 --> 00:36:40,064
Also it's funny that Stuart says that he wanted trouble he would have brought a rifle because

876
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,088
If you read the indictment

877
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:44,416
You'll find it on the way from Texas to d.c. Stuart quote

878
00:36:44,672 --> 00:36:45,696
Approximately

879
00:36:45,952 --> 00:36:46,720
$6,000

880
00:36:46,976 --> 00:36:49,024
In Texas on an AR platform rifle

881
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:49,792
And firearms

882
00:36:50,816 --> 00:36:52,864
This was on January 3rd which is an addition

883
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:53,888
$5,000

884
00:36:54,144 --> 00:36:54,912
C-SPAN on firearms

885
00:36:55,168 --> 00:36:56,960
Equipment

886
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,312
Yeah and $4,500 more than

887
00:37:01,568 --> 00:37:02,592
Despite all January 4th and

888
00:37:02,848 --> 00:37:03,872
Mississippi on Gunn equip

889
00:37:04,128 --> 00:37:07,456
Right right a lot of money on the way

890
00:37:08,224 --> 00:37:08,736
If you want

891
00:37:08,992 --> 00:37:10,272
Trouble he would have brought his

892
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:11,552
Spun gun from home

893
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:18,464
Osher his trouble.

894
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:21,792
Some people's yearly salary on guns and gun parts

895
00:37:22,304 --> 00:37:24,096
On the way to DC

896
00:37:24,352 --> 00:37:25,376
Yeah yeah

897
00:37:26,144 --> 00:37:28,448
It's a ridiculous amount of shity bought

898
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:30,496
That seems

899
00:37:31,008 --> 00:37:34,336
Like a guy just looking to have a fun time I don't know why helicopter

900
00:37:34,592 --> 00:37:35,104
Just for you

901
00:37:36,384 --> 00:37:38,944
Further it's b******* that stewardess saying that he didn't want violence

902
00:37:40,736 --> 00:37:41,760
Because that would service Altima

903
00:37:42,016 --> 00:37:42,528
My goal

904
00:37:42,784 --> 00:37:45,856
The goal of that day's actions was to disrupt the certification of the election

905
00:37:46,112 --> 00:37:46,624
Can put Stewart

906
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:47,392
Is a big picture

907
00:37:47,648 --> 00:37:48,416
Her guy and for him

908
00:37:48,672 --> 00:37:49,440
The end goal is action

909
00:37:49,696 --> 00:37:50,720
Penzeys for the president

910
00:37:50,976 --> 00:37:52,256
To declare complete emergency

911
00:37:52,512 --> 00:37:53,792
I called The Oath Keepers up

912
00:37:54,048 --> 00:37:56,096
Under Stewart's command to be the new Army

913
00:37:56,864 --> 00:37:57,632
This isn't something you

914
00:37:57,888 --> 00:38:01,472
The preoccupied with for the better part of my history listening to him on Alex's show

915
00:38:01,984 --> 00:38:03,776
That's a very clear objective of his action

916
00:38:05,312 --> 00:38:11,456
If you consult the original indictment of his associates you can see that he even thought that the January 6th could serve as a flash

917
00:38:11,712 --> 00:38:12,480
CashPoint for that scum

918
00:38:12,736 --> 00:38:13,248
Pass

919
00:38:14,016 --> 00:38:17,088
Antifa

920
00:38:17,344 --> 00:38:18,112
Kinetic back on them

921
00:38:18,624 --> 00:38:19,136
I will eat

922
00:38:19,392 --> 00:38:20,416
Sacrifice myself for that

923
00:38:20,928 --> 00:38:22,208
Let the fight start here

924
00:38:22,464 --> 00:38:24,256
That will give President Trump what he needs

925
00:38:24,512 --> 00:38:25,024
Frankly

926
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:26,560
Hey things go kinetic good

927
00:38:26,816 --> 00:38:28,352
What if they throw bombs at us and shoot us

928
00:38:28,608 --> 00:38:30,400
Great because that brings the president

929
00:38:30,912 --> 00:38:35,264
Bring the president his reason and rationale for dropping the Insurrection Act

930
00:38:35,776 --> 00:38:36,288
We hope

931
00:38:36,544 --> 00:38:37,568
He gives us those orders

932
00:38:37,824 --> 00:38:38,336
We wanted to

933
00:38:38,592 --> 00:38:39,872
Declare an insurrection

934
00:38:40,128 --> 00:38:41,152
Had to call us up is the militia

935
00:38:42,688 --> 00:38:45,760
Probably one of the few people who actually did hope that things

936
00:38:46,016 --> 00:38:47,808
Got to a worst-case scenario on January 6th

937
00:38:48,064 --> 00:38:48,832
61 Stewart Road

938
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:51,648
He believed them things went completely off the rails

939
00:38:51,904 --> 00:38:52,672
Strumpet

940
00:38:52,928 --> 00:38:56,000
Bring in The Oath Keepers as his personal militia Army at which point

941
00:38:56,256 --> 00:38:58,560
Stuart could do what he feels the current politicians

942
00:38:58,816 --> 00:39:00,352
Some soldiers don't have the guts to do

943
00:39:00,608 --> 00:39:03,424
Namely arrest and kill his political enemies

944
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:04,704
Ideally without concert

945
00:39:05,984 --> 00:39:07,008
This interview with Alex's

946
00:39:07,264 --> 00:39:07,776
Is a fairly decent

947
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:11,104
It's spinning things to a person who's financially and ready

948
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:13,152
Mutational required to agree with you

949
00:39:13,408 --> 00:39:14,176
But it's embarrassing

950
00:39:14,432 --> 00:39:14,944
Sing s***

951
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,736
Nothing but disrespect for in search

952
00:39:16,992 --> 00:39:18,528
Going to walk stand behind their failed attempt

953
00:39:18,784 --> 00:39:19,296
Insurrection

954
00:39:20,064 --> 00:39:21,088
Boo

955
00:39:21,344 --> 00:39:24,928
Yep I say boo to you Road

956
00:39:26,208 --> 00:39:26,720
Have courage inside

957
00:39:27,232 --> 00:39:28,768
We'll talk about it

958
00:39:31,072 --> 00:39:31,840
The thing is that

959
00:39:32,096 --> 00:39:33,888
Interest me though is that when you look

960
00:39:34,144 --> 00:39:37,472
Look at the PowerPoint presentation released by Trump

961
00:39:37,728 --> 00:39:43,360
Her not release my drop but that thing went over the one that included

962
00:39:43,616 --> 00:39:45,408
Declare National Emergency

963
00:39:45,664 --> 00:39:48,224
Not do the certified it was also a constant

964
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:51,296
Topic

965
00:39:51,552 --> 00:39:52,064
The whole thing

966
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:58,464
Write it Stewart came on out to show to advocate for that open letter website

967
00:40:01,024 --> 00:40:01,536
And

968
00:40:01,792 --> 00:40:02,560
DIY ideas

969
00:40:03,072 --> 00:40:05,376
Set these people are so deluded

970
00:40:05,888 --> 00:40:07,424
As to think that they could

971
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:08,448
Trump

972
00:40:08,704 --> 00:40:09,728
Ultimate power

973
00:40:09,984 --> 00:40:11,008
And then he would

974
00:40:11,264 --> 00:40:12,032
Cold

975
00:40:13,312 --> 00:40:15,104
Military it do

976
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:19,968
William dollar thing is I got to call if a dum-dum Oath Keepers

977
00:40:20,224 --> 00:40:20,992
Keepers of the f****** loyal

978
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:22,272
Stan

979
00:40:23,552 --> 00:40:26,112
You need you need them because also they have C

980
00:40:26,368 --> 00:40:31,232
Secret members of the military within their ranks of the military will come along

981
00:40:31,488 --> 00:40:35,840
I mean you want them as a death squad but you're not going to call them up till work

982
00:40:36,096 --> 00:40:38,656
For you will probably want them

983
00:40:38,912 --> 00:40:39,680
Time to do some dirty work

984
00:40:39,936 --> 00:40:40,448
And then

985
00:40:40,704 --> 00:40:43,008
To wipe them out like Hitler

986
00:40:44,032 --> 00:40:46,336
Oh my God you guys are so evil how could

987
00:40:46,592 --> 00:40:48,896
Could you possibly do this evil horrible Act

988
00:40:49,152 --> 00:40:50,688
I mean whatever

989
00:40:51,712 --> 00:40:52,992
Ripple effect

990
00:40:53,248 --> 00:40:57,088
Of that fantasy scenario ever we could

991
00:40:57,344 --> 00:41:00,160
Lexibook in terms of like how that would play out they were going under the

992
00:41:00,672 --> 00:41:02,976
2

993
00:41:03,232 --> 00:41:08,096
Yeah like that is the goal that he is wanted for a very long time

994
00:41:08,352 --> 00:41:09,120
This is something

995
00:41:09,376 --> 00:41:10,400
For the better part of the Trump

996
00:41:10,656 --> 00:41:11,680
Administration this was

997
00:41:11,936 --> 00:41:12,960
Something that he was at

998
00:41:13,216 --> 00:41:14,752
Forza

999
00:41:15,008 --> 00:41:16,288
Keepers to be the actual Army

1000
00:41:16,544 --> 00:41:17,056
I mean

1001
00:41:17,312 --> 00:41:18,336
This is

1002
00:41:18,848 --> 00:41:20,128
Clearly if you look at the key

1003
00:41:20,384 --> 00:41:20,896
Communication

1004
00:41:22,176 --> 00:41:22,944
He had this

1005
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:25,248
Something that he was looking

1006
00:41:25,504 --> 00:41:27,040
Maybe this will be the time

1007
00:41:27,552 --> 00:41:28,064
It's the last

1008
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,088
David

1009
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:33,440
The hard constitutional deadline for the election to be certified

1010
00:41:33,952 --> 00:41:34,464
The time

1011
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:35,488
For trumpet

1012
00:41:35,744 --> 00:41:36,256
Call us up

1013
00:41:36,512 --> 00:41:37,280
Yeah

1014
00:41:37,792 --> 00:41:38,304
Violin

1015
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:40,096
What's good give him the pre-tax

1016
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:41,888
And forever

1017
00:41:42,144 --> 00:41:43,168
Your end goal is

1018
00:41:43,424 --> 00:41:44,960
To kill your political enemies

1019
00:41:45,472 --> 00:41:47,008
You the only the state gets

1020
00:41:47,264 --> 00:41:48,032
To do that without con

1021
00:41:50,592 --> 00:41:51,360
So you got to be the state

1022
00:41:51,616 --> 00:41:52,384
So

1023
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:53,663
Earlier we heard

1024
00:41:53,919 --> 00:41:55,199
Stewart say that like

1025
00:41:55,455 --> 00:41:55,967
You know him

1026
00:41:56,223 --> 00:41:56,991
Talking to people

1027
00:41:57,247 --> 00:41:58,271
Just attempts at Kohl's

1028
00:41:58,527 --> 00:42:00,319
Because we just no reception at all.

1029
00:42:04,159 --> 00:42:06,463
Earpieces

1030
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:07,743
Try to be on a radio

1031
00:42:07,999 --> 00:42:11,583
Stop the crowds going in and I couldn't hear myself it was so well

1032
00:42:12,351 --> 00:42:15,935
That's ridiculous

1033
00:42:16,703 --> 00:42:20,543
We're trying to get ahold of her

1034
00:42:20,799 --> 00:42:23,359
You're not Azar security detail, here

1035
00:42:23,615 --> 00:42:26,687
And we were supposed to have

1036
00:42:26,943 --> 00:42:28,223
Area in Northwest

1037
00:42:30,271 --> 00:42:33,343
It was a schedule event. That was supposed to be

1038
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:34,111
From

1039
00:42:41,791 --> 00:42:44,351
With a million people there sings the frogs in election

1040
00:42:44,607 --> 00:42:45,119
Peacefully

1041
00:42:45,631 --> 00:42:47,935
They were very successful hijacking and taking over

1042
00:42:48,191 --> 00:42:48,703
Blue

1043
00:42:48,959 --> 00:42:52,031
Pictures of the calls that he had there were like 30 second

1044
00:42:52,287 --> 00:42:53,567
Kim's long those are probably attend

1045
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:56,895
Call

1046
00:42:57,151 --> 00:42:57,919
That's even conference

1047
00:42:58,175 --> 00:42:59,967
Call people like

1048
00:43:00,991 --> 00:43:05,599
Another Point worth mentioning is the Ali Alexander got a permit to hold an event at that space by

1049
00:43:05,855 --> 00:43:08,671
Filing for one with a dummy organization name

1050
00:43:08,927 --> 00:43:09,951
One nation under God

1051
00:43:10,207 --> 00:43:12,511
Because he knew that they wouldn't give him a permit.

1052
00:43:12,767 --> 00:43:13,279
Bastille

1053
00:43:13,535 --> 00:43:16,351
His permit was also for an event with a maximum attendance

1054
00:43:16,607 --> 00:43:17,631
50 people which was

1055
00:43:17,887 --> 00:43:18,399
Obvious

1056
00:43:18,911 --> 00:43:20,959
Obviously a number that he knew he was going to

1057
00:43:21,215 --> 00:43:21,727
Exceed

1058
00:43:21,983 --> 00:43:22,751
Title loan

1059
00:43:23,007 --> 00:43:25,055
Is probably something they could get Ali charged with like

1060
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:27,359
Criminal negligence or something similar because

1061
00:43:27,615 --> 00:43:31,455
I have an event there which he got a permit for under false pretenses

1062
00:43:31,967 --> 00:43:35,807
He was drawing far more people to the area right around the capital than was safe

1063
00:43:36,063 --> 00:43:38,623
According to what was allowed by his permit need did that

1064
00:43:39,135 --> 00:43:39,647
Full $4

1065
00:43:40,671 --> 00:43:41,439
Dunrite fraud

1066
00:43:41,951 --> 00:43:43,743
Yeah these are all various elements of

1067
00:43:43,999 --> 00:43:45,279
The chaos that occurred that day

1068
00:43:45,535 --> 00:43:46,303
You can begin to

1069
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:49,631
Missy various actors who made intentional choices that led to what happen

1070
00:43:50,143 --> 00:43:52,959
Whether or not they knew what would happen or even coordinator

1071
00:43:53,215 --> 00:43:53,727
Google teach other

1072
00:43:54,239 --> 00:43:57,823
Trump told people at his rally to go to the capital that he was going to come with

1073
00:43:58,335 --> 00:43:58,847
What you didn't do

1074
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:04,479
Alex Letta March to the capital of people who were only getting more and more amped up along the way without

1075
00:44:04,735 --> 00:44:07,039
Screaming should about 1776 into his bowl

1076
00:44:07,807 --> 00:44:09,087
I only set up an event at the

1077
00:44:09,343 --> 00:44:10,111
The capitol grounds

1078
00:44:10,367 --> 00:44:11,391
But he knew was going to get out of

1079
00:44:11,647 --> 00:44:13,951
Control just based on the numbers of people who are going to be there

1080
00:44:14,719 --> 00:44:17,023
Stuart Nadeem coordinated to use military tax

1081
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:18,303
Fix to move through the crowd at 3

1082
00:44:18,559 --> 00:44:19,071
Reach the capital

1083
00:44:19,327 --> 00:44:23,935
While haven't weapons caches nearby for when Trump decided to make them the new Army of the u.s.

1084
00:44:24,703 --> 00:44:27,007
These people like Ali and Alex better f******

1085
00:44:27,263 --> 00:44:30,079
Pray that they don't have any texts or e-mails lingering around

1086
00:44:30,335 --> 00:44:31,615
Indicate that there was Gordon

1087
00:44:31,871 --> 00:44:33,151
Nation between these

1088
00:44:33,407 --> 00:44:33,919
Groups

1089
00:44:34,175 --> 00:44:35,967
Yeah in terms of what they were doing

1090
00:44:36,479 --> 00:44:38,015
I could actually believe that

1091
00:44:38,271 --> 00:44:38,783
There was

1092
00:44:39,295 --> 00:44:40,319
Just a bunch of

1093
00:44:40,831 --> 00:44:42,367
F****** weirdos who were old

1094
00:44:42,623 --> 00:44:44,415
Spiritually on the same page

1095
00:44:44,671 --> 00:44:45,695
Coordinate with each other

1096
00:44:45,951 --> 00:44:46,719
But

1097
00:44:46,975 --> 00:44:48,767
The prospect that there was

1098
00:44:49,023 --> 00:44:50,047
Some kind of like

1099
00:44:52,095 --> 00:44:52,607
Conscious

1100
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:55,167
Knowledge of each other's plans yeah

1101
00:44:55,679 --> 00:44:56,703
But I know

1102
00:44:58,239 --> 00:44:59,007
No that's conspiracy

1103
00:44:59,263 --> 00:45:00,031
They better

1104
00:45:00,287 --> 00:45:02,079
F****** pray that there isn't

1105
00:45:02,591 --> 00:45:04,127
Some signal message

1106
00:45:04,383 --> 00:45:07,455
I thought might be encrypted and not be able to be accessed

1107
00:45:07,711 --> 00:45:08,223
Because

1108
00:45:08,735 --> 00:45:10,783
Yeah you know reading through that

1109
00:45:11,039 --> 00:45:13,855
You've got to figure these guys had to have just assumed

1110
00:45:14,111 --> 00:45:14,879
That they were going to

1111
00:45:15,135 --> 00:45:15,647
To get away

1112
00:45:21,791 --> 00:45:24,607
How could you do that

1113
00:45:24,863 --> 00:45:26,911
I don't I don't know if I'm boring

1114
00:45:27,167 --> 00:45:28,703
Inclined to believe that they thought that it would be

1115
00:45:28,959 --> 00:45:29,471
Successful

1116
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:30,495
Or

1117
00:45:30,751 --> 00:45:31,775
That they thought

1118
00:45:32,799 --> 00:45:33,567
That there

1119
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:34,847
Comms remorse

1120
00:45:35,103 --> 00:45:35,615
Secure than they thought

1121
00:45:35,871 --> 00:45:42,015
I mean maybe it's just this is what happens whenever your entire organization is not like trains

1122
00:45:42,271 --> 00:45:44,063
Insomuch as grew up watching movies

1123
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:47,135
The movie room

1124
00:45:47,391 --> 00:45:53,535
These people are actually ex-military they've had a lot of them have had training a lot of areas at Lely rela

1125
00:45:53,791 --> 00:45:57,119
100-percent I understand that part but

1126
00:45:58,399 --> 00:46:04,543
Really you think that just a signal alone if there were articles written in 2018 about they can crack

1127
00:46:04,799 --> 00:46:08,639
Back signal I understand there is a conventional with

1128
00:46:09,151 --> 00:46:13,247
People have that it is far more secure in uncrackable

1129
00:46:13,503 --> 00:46:19,647
If you didn't read that article maybe you would

1130
00:46:19,903 --> 00:46:21,439
Protonmail

1131
00:46:21,695 --> 00:46:23,231
Texas or whatever you know like

1132
00:46:23,743 --> 00:46:27,327
More secure than other deliveries but

1133
00:46:29,887 --> 00:46:30,399
Do planets read

1134
00:46:31,679 --> 00:46:32,447
So

1135
00:46:33,983 --> 00:46:34,495
Who's Bonnie

1136
00:46:35,263 --> 00:46:37,823
I think you should help try to lead an investigation

1137
00:46:39,103 --> 00:46:41,663
Who did that

1138
00:46:42,175 --> 00:46:44,991
And you're blaming you so I mean how do you think I should lead

1139
00:46:45,247 --> 00:46:47,039
That's kind of what I'm doing now is

1140
00:46:47,295 --> 00:46:49,343
When you had a bunch of shows about it we've had

1141
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:50,879
Big debates about it

1142
00:46:51,647 --> 00:46:53,183
Become a big issue with an L

1143
00:46:53,439 --> 00:46:54,463
Can I put you in the middle of it

1144
00:46:54,719 --> 00:46:56,255
I would say that if Stewart was in charge of

1145
00:46:56,511 --> 00:46:58,047
Investigating this would be a short investigation

1146
00:46:58,303 --> 00:47:00,351
Fox placed in charge of who killed

1147
00:47:02,399 --> 00:47:08,543
Sweetheart

1148
00:47:09,567 --> 00:47:12,127
Absolutely

1149
00:47:13,407 --> 00:47:14,175
Stewart

1150
00:47:14,431 --> 00:47:15,711
What's the the government

1151
00:47:15,967 --> 00:47:16,735
The dump all the

1152
00:47:16,991 --> 00:47:18,527
They have because he knows

1153
00:47:19,551 --> 00:47:20,319
Whistleblower could

1154
00:47:21,343 --> 00:47:24,415
Antifa provocateur

1155
00:47:25,183 --> 00:47:26,719
I call on DHHS

1156
00:47:26,975 --> 00:47:27,487
NSA

1157
00:47:27,743 --> 00:47:29,791
You guys can still do a data dump

1158
00:47:30,047 --> 00:47:31,071
You can do it right now

1159
00:47:31,327 --> 00:47:33,887
Don't suppose all the dirt

1160
00:47:34,143 --> 00:47:34,911
Aldi

1161
00:47:35,935 --> 00:47:37,727
All the provocateurs you know who they are

1162
00:47:37,983 --> 00:47:41,567
Go to the data. You do it anonymously go do it

1163
00:47:41,823 --> 00:47:43,103
And anybody out there

1164
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:44,383
Blackmail

1165
00:47:44,895 --> 00:47:45,407
Or two words

1166
00:47:45,663 --> 00:47:46,175
Store bought out

1167
00:47:47,967 --> 00:47:48,991
Will forgive you

1168
00:47:49,247 --> 00:47:51,039
Expose it be whistleblower

1169
00:47:51,295 --> 00:47:53,599
Difference

1170
00:47:53,855 --> 00:47:55,391
Do the right thing for your country

1171
00:47:55,903 --> 00:47:58,207
It's fascinating to hear this knowing what we know

1172
00:47:58,463 --> 00:47:59,487
Nose

1173
00:48:01,791 --> 00:48:04,351
This is such a fraudulent performer

1174
00:48:04,607 --> 00:48:05,375
Videos putting on

1175
00:48:05,887 --> 00:48:08,447
And its operating under the assumption that he

1176
00:48:09,983 --> 00:48:10,495
That information

1177
00:48:10,751 --> 00:48:11,519
Does exist

1178
00:48:11,775 --> 00:48:16,895
There are whistleblowers were being blackmailed into not talking about the antifa provocateur

1179
00:48:17,407 --> 00:48:19,199
Like those people exist and he's reaching out

1180
00:48:20,735 --> 00:48:22,527
He's fully aware of his actions

1181
00:48:22,783 --> 00:48:23,551
So this is

1182
00:48:23,807 --> 00:48:24,831
This is local news

1183
00:48:25,343 --> 00:48:28,159
This is the husband who has killed his wife

1184
00:48:28,671 --> 00:48:29,951
On TV saying

1185
00:48:30,719 --> 00:48:31,999
Where we just want to find her

1186
00:48:32,255 --> 00:48:34,559
We just want to find her she's lost

1187
00:48:35,071 --> 00:48:36,351
We want you to come home

1188
00:48:36,863 --> 00:48:39,423
Knowing full well that her head and hands are in his f******

1189
00:48:39,679 --> 00:48:41,215
Drunk it does have that vibe

1190
00:48:41,983 --> 00:48:43,775
So

1191
00:48:45,055 --> 00:48:47,103
We were like Alex

1192
00:48:47,615 --> 00:48:49,919
Let's stop using words that make me feel bad

1193
00:48:50,175 --> 00:48:51,967
We have to stop

1194
00:48:52,223 --> 00:48:54,783
We should stop talking about military formations and

1195
00:48:55,039 --> 00:48:58,367
And storming the Capitol in insurrection

1196
00:49:00,159 --> 00:49:01,695
What it was you said

1197
00:49:01,951 --> 00:49:02,975
Protest

1198
00:49:03,231 --> 00:49:04,511
Small elements

1199
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:08,095
Were some people insult the police

1200
00:49:08,351 --> 00:49:08,863
Hey

1201
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:10,143
They got their problems

1202
00:49:10,655 --> 00:49:11,423
Because we actually saw the

1203
00:49:11,679 --> 00:49:12,191
Police officer

1204
00:49:12,703 --> 00:49:15,007
Everybody else and walk through doors already open

1205
00:49:15,775 --> 00:49:19,359
Sweeney's.

1206
00:49:19,871 --> 00:49:20,383
And look at

1207
00:49:20,639 --> 00:49:22,175
Big picture is

1208
00:49:22,431 --> 00:49:24,223
They're using like the reichstag fire

1209
00:49:24,479 --> 00:49:29,343
Peter Peter Noone at 11 to turn out more inward on us either reject an entire.

1210
00:49:29,855 --> 00:49:32,415
If I were Stewart I would also be employing people decide using words

1211
00:49:32,671 --> 00:49:33,695
Like military formations

1212
00:49:33,951 --> 00:49:35,743
Because when they do they're just talk

1213
00:49:35,999 --> 00:49:36,511
I'm about Stewart's

1214
00:49:37,535 --> 00:49:41,375
If you read the indictment that Stewart's facing the idea seems to come up with

1215
00:49:42,143 --> 00:49:42,655
Princeton

1216
00:49:42,911 --> 00:49:48,031
Quote on December 12th 2020 the North Carolina chapter of The Oath Keepers

1217
00:49:48,287 --> 00:49:50,591
According to the leader that chapter will be focused on

1218
00:49:50,847 --> 00:49:54,687
Vehicle operations roadblocks vehicle recovery Convoy operations

1219
00:49:55,199 --> 00:49:56,991
Setting up hasty ambushes

1220
00:49:57,247 --> 00:49:58,527
Reacting to ambushes

1221
00:49:58,783 --> 00:50:00,063
But the first thing we're going to

1222
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:02,879
To do is fall into formation when we Assemble

1223
00:50:03,647 --> 00:50:04,927
When things got going to Coco

1224
00:50:05,183 --> 00:50:05,695
Conspirators Farm

1225
00:50:05,951 --> 00:50:07,999
Stax I moved information to approach

1226
00:50:08,255 --> 00:50:08,767
Steve breech

1227
00:50:09,279 --> 00:50:09,791
Of capital

1228
00:50:11,071 --> 00:50:15,935
2:35 p.m. bags Watson Hackett more shell and others join together

1229
00:50:16,191 --> 00:50:17,215
Formstack

1230
00:50:17,471 --> 00:50:19,007
Maneuvered in an organized fashion.

1231
00:50:19,263 --> 00:50:20,799
The steps to the Eastside Rotunda

1232
00:50:21,055 --> 00:50:25,407
The doors each member keeping at least one hand on the shoulder of the other in front

1233
00:50:26,943 --> 00:50:31,039
This is the same type of formation that was used by the other co-conspirators in laid up stack two

1234
00:50:32,063 --> 00:50:32,831
Resisting the urge

1235
00:50:33,087 --> 00:50:35,135
Gotham stack really hard

1236
00:50:35,391 --> 00:50:36,159
So difficult

1237
00:50:37,695 --> 00:50:43,583
I'm with you obviously wouldn't want people talk about military formations if people were using on January 6th

1238
00:50:43,839 --> 00:50:48,703
Because he's ahead of a paramilitary organization using military formations that day

1239
00:50:49,215 --> 00:50:51,519
It obviously doesn't want people to use the word insurrection

1240
00:50:52,031 --> 00:50:53,311
Cuz he wrote to open letters

1241
00:50:53,567 --> 00:50:54,335
To Trump

1242
00:50:54,591 --> 00:50:55,871
Published online where he was

1243
00:50:56,127 --> 00:50:57,663
Desperately begging Trump to use the in

1244
00:50:57,919 --> 00:50:58,687
Insurrection Act

1245
00:50:59,199 --> 00:51:00,479
His friends could pretend to be the army

1246
00:51:00,735 --> 00:51:02,527
Enroute text in Signal messages

1247
00:51:02,783 --> 00:51:06,367
While the storm was going on celebrating it essentially as an

1248
00:51:06,623 --> 00:51:08,671
No no no you don't understand okay so what

1249
00:51:08,927 --> 00:51:09,695
What happened was

1250
00:51:10,207 --> 00:51:10,975
Antifa

1251
00:51:11,231 --> 00:51:14,047
Were surveilling the o.c.

1252
00:51:14,303 --> 00:51:16,351
Keepers in learning their training methods

1253
00:51:16,607 --> 00:51:17,119
Alright

1254
00:51:17,375 --> 00:51:18,399
So then whenever they went

1255
00:51:18,655 --> 00:51:23,263
Instigate the used the knowledge that they had gleaned from watching The Oath Keepers

1256
00:51:23,519 --> 00:51:25,823
Who are by the way so well-trained they would never

1257
00:51:29,151 --> 00:51:30,687
They infiltrated all of the cam

1258
00:51:31,711 --> 00:51:32,479
The signal Chats on

1259
00:51:32,735 --> 00:51:34,271
FIFA made

1260
00:51:34,527 --> 00:51:40,671
The things that he was saying really does feel like Stewart's like man I'm the only person here who wasn't antifa

1261
00:51:41,439 --> 00:51:42,975
And all those things I said

1262
00:51:43,231 --> 00:51:49,375
They're pretending to the dangerous extremist But ultimately is also a boring one

1263
00:51:49,631 --> 00:51:53,215
At least partially because his revolutionary spirit is kind of entertainment

1264
00:51:53,471 --> 00:51:56,287
His desire to make money off his revolutionary bran

1265
00:51:57,311 --> 00:51:59,359
It's great to be into the Insurrection until it doesn't work

1266
00:51:59,615 --> 00:52:00,383
Because then you have to

1267
00:52:00,895 --> 00:52:01,407
The business

1268
00:52:01,919 --> 00:52:04,735
If the Insurrection had worked and trumpet invoke the Insurrection Act

1269
00:52:04,991 --> 00:52:05,759
Inmate Stewart the head of a

1270
00:52:06,015 --> 00:52:07,551
The newly deputized militia

1271
00:52:07,807 --> 00:52:08,319
You'd be hearing

1272
00:52:08,575 --> 00:52:11,391
Very different tone from him but things that he did in the lead-up to

1273
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:16,255
Baby Bratz

1274
00:52:16,511 --> 00:52:18,559
TV all the time with

1275
00:52:18,815 --> 00:52:19,327
Tucker Carlson

1276
00:52:19,583 --> 00:52:22,399
Saying hey isn't it great that I made this a fast

1277
00:52:22,655 --> 00:52:25,471
Just country and none of this would have been possible without the intro

1278
00:52:25,727 --> 00:52:28,031
Planning of me and my friend

1279
00:52:28,543 --> 00:52:29,055
Such b*******

1280
00:52:29,311 --> 00:52:30,079
Need be like

1281
00:52:30,335 --> 00:52:31,103
The f****** swapfell

1282
00:52:31,615 --> 00:52:32,127
That would be

1283
00:52:35,199 --> 00:52:37,759
Excuse that store ears is about the fact that

1284
00:52:38,015 --> 00:52:39,295
Keepers to go into the

1285
00:52:39,807 --> 00:52:40,831
We can't really deny that

1286
00:52:41,855 --> 00:52:42,367
Finally true

1287
00:52:42,879 --> 00:52:44,671
In order to explain that away

1288
00:52:44,927 --> 00:52:46,207
Here's what story uses

1289
00:52:46,719 --> 00:52:47,231
And it's

1290
00:52:47,487 --> 00:52:51,071
Horseshit Merlot Universal two weeks.

1291
00:52:51,327 --> 00:52:55,167
Interviewed me ice I give an interview with them against legal counsel advised

1292
00:52:55,679 --> 00:52:57,471
Guys were doing

1293
00:52:59,263 --> 00:53:05,407
Nellie told me after the fact they went in the renter Medical Aid after they heard that Ashley rabbit have been shot

1294
00:53:05,663 --> 00:53:07,711
Interview where they were they found themselves

1295
00:53:08,991 --> 00:53:10,527
Well you know they were like

1296
00:53:10,783 --> 00:53:15,135
Guy walked up and said you know where to get your phone without trying to arrest you

1297
00:53:15,647 --> 00:53:16,671
You know an Indian

1298
00:53:16,927 --> 00:53:19,743
Is everything like you said it was and your interviews and media that

1299
00:53:19,999 --> 00:53:21,023
All you got

1300
00:53:21,279 --> 00:53:24,607
Anyting

1301
00:53:28,191 --> 00:53:28,703
So

1302
00:53:29,215 --> 00:53:31,775
They were asking me about what our guys didn't I said hey

1303
00:53:32,287 --> 00:53:34,591
They went in only because it hurts only been shot

1304
00:53:35,103 --> 00:53:36,383
Ashley told me and

1305
00:53:39,455 --> 00:53:40,991
The best of intentions

1306
00:53:41,503 --> 00:53:42,527
This complete bulshit

1307
00:53:43,039 --> 00:53:45,599
Ashley Babbitt was shot at 2:44 p.m.

1308
00:53:45,855 --> 00:53:47,647
Any kind of have to assume that their wooden

1309
00:53:47,903 --> 00:53:50,719
Be immediate relaying of this information to people outside the capitol

1310
00:53:51,231 --> 00:53:55,583
There's a decent chance that if you were in the crowd it would take longer for you to learn about that

1311
00:53:55,839 --> 00:53:56,607
Someone just watching

1312
00:53:56,863 --> 00:53:57,375
TV

1313
00:53:57,631 --> 00:54:00,447
Being a generous as I'm willing to be let's say that it

1314
00:54:00,703 --> 00:54:01,215
Took 6 minutes

1315
00:54:01,471 --> 00:54:03,519
That's four words get out from the site of the shooting

1316
00:54:03,775 --> 00:54:05,311
To The Wider population outside

1317
00:54:05,823 --> 00:54:07,871
Sure it's arbitrary but it also doesn't matter

1318
00:54:08,639 --> 00:54:11,967
By that point co-conspirators had breached

1319
00:54:12,223 --> 00:54:14,527
The capital and we're in contact with him then

1320
00:54:15,807 --> 00:54:16,575
What was

1321
00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:18,111
For example

1322
00:54:19,135 --> 00:54:23,231
A 235 Meg's Watkins Hackett Marshall another's join together

1323
00:54:23,487 --> 00:54:24,255
Formstack one

1324
00:54:24,767 --> 00:54:25,791
Harrison joint

1325
00:54:26,047 --> 00:54:27,327
Stack one when it reached

1326
00:54:27,583 --> 00:54:28,095
The top of the staff

1327
00:54:28,863 --> 00:54:32,959
At the top of the steps back one pushed forward as part of a mob that aggressively advance

1328
00:54:33,215 --> 00:54:34,239
Store the Rotunda doors

1329
00:54:34,495 --> 00:54:36,799
Assaulting the law enforcement officers guarding the doors

1330
00:54:37,311 --> 00:54:37,823
Through objects

1331
00:54:38,335 --> 00:54:40,383
Chemicals Dorothy officers at the doors

1332
00:54:40,895 --> 00:54:42,431
Hand-pulled violently at the door

1333
00:54:43,455 --> 00:54:44,735
At 2:39 p.m.

1334
00:54:44,991 --> 00:54:51,135
Remember stackone join the crowd and forcibly pushing against one of the Rotunda doors and align forcement officers guarding that door

1335
00:54:51,647 --> 00:54:52,415
The mob

1336
00:54:52,671 --> 00:54:55,231
Change the doors and the stack one member enter the building

1337
00:54:55,743 --> 00:54:59,071
Shortly after the mob breed silver time to doors Meg's Harrelson walk

1338
00:54:59,327 --> 00:55:00,607
Can pack it more shallow than others

1339
00:55:00,863 --> 00:55:02,143
Force their way through the doors

1340
00:55:02,399 --> 00:55:02,911
Into the Kappa

1341
00:55:03,935 --> 00:55:04,447
Dissolve

1342
00:55:04,703 --> 00:55:06,239
Before 2:44 Wenatchee

1343
00:55:06,495 --> 00:55:07,007
Tobacco shop

1344
00:55:07,263 --> 00:55:08,287
My advice

1345
00:55:09,055 --> 00:55:10,079
And this is been the case

1346
00:55:10,591 --> 00:55:11,359
Ever since I

1347
00:55:11,615 --> 00:55:16,223
Watch reality TV shows about like First 48 and all of that

1348
00:55:17,503 --> 00:55:19,551
You have the right to remain silent

1349
00:55:20,063 --> 00:55:26,207
Yeah if you could just not go to the FBI directly to the

1350
00:55:26,463 --> 00:55:30,559
Take I have to take that as

1351
00:55:30,815 --> 00:55:33,375
Coming from him as opposed to something I know.

1352
00:55:34,399 --> 00:55:39,263
Good point possibly

1353
00:55:40,031 --> 00:55:40,799
There's no chance of

1354
00:55:41,055 --> 00:55:44,383
But their actions could be motivated by a concern about a person being shot

1355
00:55:44,639 --> 00:55:48,991
In-store knows what he's doing on this show he's lying to provide cover for himself and his militia

1356
00:55:49,759 --> 00:55:50,527
3 minutes

1357
00:55:50,783 --> 00:55:53,599
Before stackone made their Advance on the capital Meg's

1358
00:55:53,855 --> 00:55:54,367
Who was apart of

1359
00:55:54,623 --> 00:55:55,135
Taquan

1360
00:55:55,391 --> 00:55:56,159
Was on a conference

1361
00:55:56,415 --> 00:55:57,183
Call with Stewart

1362
00:55:57,439 --> 00:56:02,559
And it to 44 the exact time Babbitt was shot walk-ins announced on their Zello walkie

1363
00:56:02,815 --> 00:56:03,839
Kataki Channel quote

1364
00:56:04,095 --> 00:56:07,679
We are in the mezzanine we're in the main dome right now we're rocking it

1365
00:56:07,935 --> 00:56:11,263
They're throwing grenades f****** shooting people with paintballs

1366
00:56:13,311 --> 00:56:15,359
One minute later stackone members

1367
00:56:15,615 --> 00:56:20,479
Began trying to force their way past law enforcement who are blocking the path from the Rotonda to the Senate chamber

1368
00:56:20,735 --> 00:56:21,247
With walking

1369
00:56:22,271 --> 00:56:23,295
Push push they can't hold

1370
00:56:24,319 --> 00:56:27,391
After they got teargas today decided to retreat and some of them went to

1371
00:56:27,647 --> 00:56:29,183
Look for Nancy Pelosi at the house of

1372
00:56:30,207 --> 00:56:35,327
Cuz they were worried that she was injured by the tear gassed

1373
00:56:35,583 --> 00:56:38,911
Such nonsense

1374
00:56:39,167 --> 00:56:42,495
Back to indicated a plan to enter the capital even earlier

1375
00:56:42,751 --> 00:56:43,263
When between

1376
00:56:43,519 --> 00:56:44,031
2 +

1377
00:56:44,287 --> 00:56:44,799
2:30

1378
00:56:45,055 --> 00:56:48,383
A member of the group heard the people that breach the capital and replied quote

1379
00:56:48,895 --> 00:56:49,407
Now we're talkin

1380
00:56:49,663 --> 00:56:50,943
That's what I came here for

1381
00:56:51,711 --> 00:56:54,015
Suspiciously absent from the conversation

1382
00:56:54,271 --> 00:56:56,831
Be motivated by concern about Ashley David getting shot

1383
00:56:57,087 --> 00:56:57,855
Which also hadn't happened

1384
00:56:58,879 --> 00:57:03,231
Actually make it into the capital until after the shooting but their actions and words prior to entrance

1385
00:57:03,743 --> 00:57:05,023
Very clear what they were doing

1386
00:57:05,279 --> 00:57:05,791
And why they were doing

1387
00:57:06,815 --> 00:57:12,703
Another important point is that even if his militia goons were only going in because they were concerned about someone getting shot

1388
00:57:12,959 --> 00:57:13,471
Does anybody

1389
00:57:13,983 --> 00:57:20,127
What the f*** did they think they were going to do to deescalate the situation or help in any way

1390
00:57:21,407 --> 00:57:26,527
Okay because he wanted to sound like they wanted to help

1391
00:57:26,783 --> 00:57:27,551
But if not

1392
00:57:27,807 --> 00:57:29,855
Actually

1393
00:57:30,111 --> 00:57:36,255
Because that may be able to shoot people

1394
00:57:36,511 --> 00:57:38,815
It would be adjusted

1395
00:57:39,071 --> 00:57:41,887
Application for them to other people

1396
00:57:42,143 --> 00:57:42,911
Since they were born

1397
00:57:43,679 --> 00:57:45,215
Also there's pretty clear evidence that

1398
00:57:45,471 --> 00:57:50,335
Stewart new appetime interested in providing Medical

1399
00:57:51,103 --> 00:57:53,663
Before 2 p.m. almost an hour before Babbitt with shots

1400
00:57:53,919 --> 00:57:56,223
Someone asking the signal group Stewart was in

1401
00:57:56,479 --> 00:57:57,759
Are they actually Patriot

1402
00:57:58,015 --> 00:58:00,831
It's not those who were going in in Disguise as Patriots

1403
00:58:01,087 --> 00:58:01,599
It's cause trouble

1404
00:58:03,391 --> 00:58:04,159
Actual Patriot

1405
00:58:04,671 --> 00:58:05,951
Pissed off Patriots like the

1406
00:58:06,207 --> 00:58:07,743
The Sons of Liberty were pissed off Patriots

1407
00:58:09,023 --> 00:58:10,047
Just after that walk

1408
00:58:10,559 --> 00:58:12,351
A member of Stack one who would later

1409
00:58:12,607 --> 00:58:13,631
The capital and try to storm

1410
00:58:14,911 --> 00:58:16,447
Set on their walkie-talkie Channel quote

1411
00:58:16,703 --> 00:58:19,007
It is spread like wildfire that

1412
00:58:19,263 --> 00:58:21,567
Betrayed us and everyone's marching on the capitol

1413
00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:23,615
We have about 30 to 40 of us

1414
00:58:23,871 --> 00:58:24,895
We're sticking together it's

1415
00:58:25,407 --> 00:58:25,919
Into the plan

1416
00:58:27,967 --> 00:58:28,991
What was the plan exact

1417
00:58:29,759 --> 00:58:31,295
This plan to hang out

1418
00:58:31,551 --> 00:58:34,623
Security for people like Rodger Stone and then going to the Capital Gazette

1419
00:58:34,879 --> 00:58:41,023
Provide emergency medical assistance but no one asked you to provide

1420
00:58:41,279 --> 00:58:42,303
Direction

1421
00:58:42,559 --> 00:58:43,071
Nonsense

1422
00:58:43,327 --> 00:58:44,351
And it strains credulity

1423
00:58:44,607 --> 00:58:48,703
Believe that your would ever think that is people behave the way he's trying to present it to Alex this is

1424
00:58:49,471 --> 00:58:50,239
Dogshit

1425
00:58:50,495 --> 00:58:51,519
Cover story

1426
00:58:51,775 --> 00:58:56,127
Is bad it's a good life of the audience though like people who watch Alex's she'll definitely believe

1427
00:58:56,895 --> 00:58:57,919
It's not going to play in court

1428
00:58:58,175 --> 00:59:00,735
Like the clear timing of action

1429
00:59:00,991 --> 00:59:01,503
And statements

1430
00:59:02,271 --> 00:59:02,783
It's

1431
00:59:03,039 --> 00:59:03,807
It's a clear lie

1432
00:59:04,063 --> 00:59:10,207
Episode of CSI Miami

1433
00:59:10,463 --> 00:59:11,999
I don't know if we're going to find this guy

1434
00:59:12,511 --> 00:59:15,071
Nope this is a 5-minute episode ATM he did it

1435
00:59:15,327 --> 00:59:16,095
Let's go

1436
00:59:16,607 --> 00:59:18,143
Stewart's even lying about

1437
00:59:18,399 --> 00:59:20,191
The like I've asked my guys

1438
00:59:20,447 --> 00:59:24,031
I got some eggs and daddy told me that the only way

1439
00:59:24,287 --> 00:59:30,431
He knows that's not true he's created a complete fiction he's he's written his movie where he this is how if we had

1440
00:59:31,199 --> 00:59:32,223
Plan to kill everybody

1441
00:59:33,503 --> 00:59:34,527
Here is a

1442
00:59:34,783 --> 00:59:37,599
Flimsy rationale that sounds kind of Defense

1443
00:59:37,855 --> 00:59:38,879
Ansible

1444
00:59:39,903 --> 00:59:40,671
So

1445
00:59:40,927 --> 00:59:43,999
Shity so we were hunting leprechaun

1446
00:59:45,791 --> 00:59:47,839
We thought that DC was a great place to find them

1447
00:59:48,095 --> 00:59:51,167
Cuz it's a leprechaun

1448
00:59:51,423 --> 00:59:57,567
Because the Deep State hates us they've taken away our payment processor

1449
01:00:00,127 --> 01:00:01,919
So I booked this is just funny

1450
01:00:03,199 --> 01:00:03,967
Follow his own advice

1451
01:00:04,223 --> 01:00:04,735
Okay

1452
01:00:05,247 --> 01:00:06,527
I told my guys all the time

1453
01:00:06,783 --> 01:00:08,575
You should presume that every chat is going to

1454
01:00:12,927 --> 01:00:15,487
FBI has found the painful and stressful country

1455
01:00:15,999 --> 01:00:18,559
But what you have to do is say I'm not going to let that stop me

1456
01:00:18,815 --> 01:00:22,143
Community organizer

1457
01:00:22,655 --> 01:00:23,167
Yeah man

1458
01:00:23,423 --> 01:00:24,191
Wow real smart

1459
01:00:24,703 --> 01:00:25,215
How

1460
01:00:25,471 --> 01:00:25,983
I mean

1461
01:00:26,239 --> 01:00:28,799
I do like the idea that maybe that's more of any

1462
01:00:29,055 --> 01:00:29,567
In retrospect

1463
01:00:29,823 --> 01:00:30,335
I kind of thought

1464
01:00:31,871 --> 01:00:34,175
Because of that I think about it

1465
01:00:34,431 --> 01:00:36,735
I have a lot of incriminating s*** in my tech

1466
01:00:36,991 --> 01:00:39,039
I really wish I had said all that face-to-face

1467
01:00:39,295 --> 01:00:43,903
I need to remind myself to assume that there are snitches and every chance

1468
01:00:44,159 --> 01:00:45,951
I will be a smart idea to not

1469
01:00:46,207 --> 01:00:47,487
Have people know my face

1470
01:00:47,743 --> 01:00:49,023
I think I should do that one

1471
01:00:49,279 --> 01:00:50,559
The interview

1472
01:00:50,815 --> 01:00:54,143
A little bit of weirdness but really not that

1473
01:00:54,399 --> 01:00:54,911
Bad

1474
01:00:55,423 --> 01:00:56,703
Ultrazone org

1475
01:00:58,495 --> 01:01:01,567
Fourth of July but so you can go do is bring the declaration independence

1476
01:01:02,079 --> 01:01:02,847
I think about

1477
01:01:03,103 --> 01:01:04,639
Long thin abusive they suffered

1478
01:01:05,151 --> 01:01:08,479
They're comparing when we are now we're pretty much the same place

1479
01:01:08,735 --> 01:01:11,039
What up surnames would you like to debate those guys

1480
01:01:12,831 --> 01:01:14,111
No I got nothing for him

1481
01:01:15,647 --> 01:01:17,951
Are there ghosts around

1482
01:01:18,463 --> 01:01:19,231
Are they

1483
01:01:19,743 --> 01:01:20,255
Thank you

1484
01:01:20,767 --> 01:01:21,535
That's really weird

1485
01:01:21,791 --> 01:01:24,607
It's the end of the interview a kind of sounded like parts of the

1486
01:01:24,863 --> 01:01:27,167
Was clumsily edited

1487
01:01:28,703 --> 01:01:30,751
I thought maybe there were parts that were

1488
01:01:31,775 --> 01:01:35,103
Wrong about this but let me down the road of life

1489
01:01:35,359 --> 01:01:35,871
Figure out like

1490
01:01:36,383 --> 01:01:37,151
Can I find this

1491
01:01:37,919 --> 01:01:39,711
Like posted before

1492
01:01:39,967 --> 01:01:41,759
Right they was posted like the

1493
01:01:42,271 --> 01:01:44,319
Is there any

1494
01:01:44,831 --> 01:01:46,367
Indication anywhere the week

1495
01:01:46,623 --> 01:01:47,135
You can find

1496
01:01:47,647 --> 01:01:49,439
Curious

1497
01:01:49,695 --> 01:01:50,975
According to Alex

1498
01:01:51,231 --> 01:01:53,535
Text your lady said this is recorded on July 2nd

1499
01:01:53,791 --> 01:01:56,351
In 2021 it was supposed to air on July 4th

1500
01:01:57,375 --> 01:02:00,703
It doesn't appear on the July 4th sure like I said he interviews Judge Joe Brown

1501
01:02:01,215 --> 01:02:01,983
That's less than

1502
01:02:02,239 --> 01:02:02,751
Belen radio

1503
01:02:03,263 --> 01:02:04,031
I went back and I listen

1504
01:02:04,287 --> 01:02:09,663
Listen to July 2nd show and sure enough Alex's discussing his plan to interview Stuart that day

1505
01:02:09,919 --> 01:02:10,943
You two are on Sunday

1506
01:02:11,199 --> 01:02:13,759
What you wanted to take off because it was the 4th of July

1507
01:02:37,567 --> 01:02:39,103
Understand

1508
01:02:39,359 --> 01:02:40,639
Stewart absolutely did not

1509
01:02:40,895 --> 01:02:41,663
Flip out on Alex

1510
01:02:41,919 --> 01:02:44,479
Some of course of that interview like how it's presented

1511
01:02:45,247 --> 01:02:46,783
And in fact listening to it I

1512
01:02:47,039 --> 01:02:49,087
Can't imagine what would make Alex not Aaron

1513
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:51,135
The only parts that are even a big deal

1514
01:02:51,391 --> 01:02:56,255
Contentious or that they when they have that misunderstanding or Stewart doesn't realize that

1515
01:02:56,511 --> 01:02:57,791
Someplace on the roof

1516
01:02:58,303 --> 01:02:59,583
And thinks that Alex might believe it

1517
01:03:00,607 --> 01:03:02,143
And then the stuff about pizza and Tilly

1518
01:03:02,655 --> 01:03:05,215
I think that part at the end

1519
01:03:07,263 --> 01:03:08,799
Is Alex is offering Dave Stewart

1520
01:03:09,055 --> 01:03:11,615
Debate Santilli so they can work out their issues

1521
01:03:11,871 --> 01:03:12,639
I think maybe

1522
01:03:12,895 --> 01:03:13,919
Leesburg got mad there

1523
01:03:14,175 --> 01:03:16,223
But it doesn't seem like a reason to Shell to the interview

1524
01:03:16,479 --> 01:03:17,759
Yeah something wasn't

1525
01:03:18,015 --> 01:03:19,807
Right to poke around

1526
01:03:20,063 --> 01:03:20,575
And see what's up

1527
01:03:21,087 --> 01:03:24,671
First thing I did was check on infowars.com see if they might have had a post

1528
01:03:24,927 --> 01:03:26,463
From July about Alex's interview with

1529
01:03:26,719 --> 01:03:28,511
When you search their website

1530
01:03:28,767 --> 01:03:29,535
Stuart roads now

1531
01:03:29,791 --> 01:03:30,559
You'll fine

1532
01:03:30,815 --> 01:03:32,607
Quickly that they have scrub the site

1533
01:03:32,863 --> 01:03:34,399
Of all but a few mentions of him

1534
01:03:35,167 --> 01:03:36,703
There are three straight post

1535
01:03:36,959 --> 01:03:37,983
It come up in a search

1536
01:03:38,495 --> 01:03:40,543
First Alert roads that have nothing to do with him

1537
01:03:41,055 --> 01:03:42,335
I am at one with a title like

1538
01:03:42,847 --> 01:03:44,639
Quick cure for the alive 40 hour emergency

1539
01:03:44,895 --> 01:03:46,175
SimpliSafe America transmission

1540
01:03:46,431 --> 01:03:48,991
Or maybe he was a guest on that and it still comes up

1541
01:03:49,503 --> 01:03:54,367
The only three articles that, but have anything directly to do with Stewart are all from the past to we

1542
01:03:55,391 --> 01:04:00,511
About the charges that Stewart just caught in one is from two weeks ago and it's just a Tom pappert blog

1543
01:04:00,767 --> 01:04:02,047
Entry about how real

1544
01:04:02,303 --> 01:04:05,119
Text John Sullivan into roads are set to testify

1545
01:04:06,399 --> 01:04:07,423
I'm not sure that held up well

1546
01:04:08,447 --> 01:04:09,983
Stuart is becoming on Alex's / 30

1547
01:04:10,239 --> 01:04:11,007
13 years

1548
01:04:11,263 --> 01:04:13,311
Countless headlines of him calling for revolution

1549
01:04:14,847 --> 01:04:16,895
They don't come up on the site when you search for him

1550
01:04:17,151 --> 01:04:18,687
That's so weird

1551
01:04:20,479 --> 01:04:21,503
It's such a good coins

1552
01:04:22,271 --> 01:04:24,831
A couple more articles come up if you do a Google search

1553
01:04:25,087 --> 01:04:25,855
Which of the Infowars

1554
01:04:26,111 --> 01:04:29,695
Four pages that much of nothing

1555
01:04:29,951 --> 01:04:30,719
Before last March

1556
01:04:31,743 --> 01:04:32,255
Weird

1557
01:04:32,511 --> 01:04:34,047
That seems insane

1558
01:04:34,303 --> 01:04:38,911
There's a section of Infowars website that's an archive of their heads

1559
01:04:39,679 --> 01:04:40,703
Some of them are pretty interesting

1560
01:04:40,959 --> 01:04:41,471
Sing like

1561
01:04:41,727 --> 01:04:42,495
Stewart Rhodes

1562
01:04:42,751 --> 01:04:44,799
Bill declares war on America

1563
01:04:45,823 --> 01:04:49,407
I dare you to try and guess what year that was from or what bill it stock

1564
01:04:49,663 --> 01:04:50,431
Talking about

1565
01:04:50,687 --> 01:04:51,455
I'm going to go with

1566
01:04:51,711 --> 01:04:53,759
2013 and

1567
01:04:54,015 --> 01:04:54,783
How about

1568
01:04:55,039 --> 01:04:58,367
The

1569
01:04:59,135 --> 01:04:59,647
I don't know

1570
01:05:01,183 --> 01:05:04,255
It's 2011 and I don't know because the body of the Articles missing

1571
01:05:05,535 --> 01:05:08,351
The game again

1572
01:05:08,607 --> 01:05:09,119
2013

1573
01:05:09,631 --> 01:05:11,679
You're in the ballpark ballpark

1574
01:05:16,287 --> 01:05:18,335
Learn of America's coming civil war

1575
01:05:18,591 --> 01:05:20,383
Keepers Stewart Rhodes reveals What could

1576
01:05:20,639 --> 01:05:21,407
Be in America's future

1577
01:05:22,175 --> 01:05:23,199
Could be from any year

1578
01:05:24,735 --> 01:05:26,271
I'm going to go

1579
01:05:26,527 --> 01:05:27,039
25th

1580
01:05:27,295 --> 01:05:27,807
29

1581
01:05:28,063 --> 01:05:34,207
Revolution

1582
01:05:34,463 --> 01:05:35,231
Then going for a

1583
01:05:35,487 --> 01:05:39,327
Maybe

1584
01:05:39,583 --> 01:05:45,215
DF rainforest advertised how complicit a wire and that actually facilitating

1585
01:05:45,727 --> 01:05:48,799
Yeah anywhere close to where he is now without Alex

1586
01:05:49,055 --> 01:05:50,847
I mean I would say

1587
01:05:51,103 --> 01:05:52,383
That I wouldn't

1588
01:05:52,639 --> 01:05:54,687
Wants to establish a pattern of the

1589
01:05:54,943 --> 01:05:55,967
Behavior

1590
01:05:56,223 --> 01:05:56,991
Especially if

1591
01:05:57,247 --> 01:05:59,039
Especially if I were the person who is Khan

1592
01:05:59,295 --> 01:06:00,319
Constantly arguing that it was

1593
01:06:01,599 --> 01:06:02,111
Who is always

1594
01:06:02,367 --> 01:06:06,975
Advocating for violence in politics for that pattern of behavior to be

1595
01:06:07,487 --> 01:06:11,839
So consistent everyday anyone talking about antifa

1596
01:06:12,863 --> 01:06:13,375
That could be trouble

1597
01:06:13,631 --> 01:06:16,191
Possibly worse however was the results of my neck

1598
01:06:16,447 --> 01:06:17,471
Poke

1599
01:06:17,727 --> 01:06:21,311
See if I could find if there was a reversion of this

1600
01:06:21,823 --> 01:06:22,335
This video

1601
01:06:22,847 --> 01:06:24,639
I search bam. Video for

1602
01:06:24,895 --> 01:06:25,407
4 Stewart Road

1603
01:06:25,663 --> 01:06:27,711
And there's a couple of posts on there that Alex you probably

1604
01:06:28,991 --> 01:06:31,807
What is a video where Alex and Owen Shroyer interview Stewart

1605
01:06:32,063 --> 01:06:32,831
With the title quote

1606
01:06:33,087 --> 01:06:34,111
Patriots plot there

1607
01:06:34,367 --> 01:06:37,951
Recapture of America in d.c. this weekend

1608
01:06:42,559 --> 01:06:45,119
Videos from November twenty

1609
01:06:45,375 --> 01:06:47,423
20 and the rally that they were going to was the

1610
01:06:47,679 --> 01:06:51,007
The climactic endpoint of Owens dumb stop Bastille Caravan Rush

1611
01:06:51,519 --> 01:06:52,799
Optics are really bad

1612
01:06:53,567 --> 01:06:57,151
It definitely sends a strong message did Alex and Owen and Stewart

1613
01:06:57,407 --> 01:06:58,431
Collaborative plant help

1614
01:06:58,687 --> 01:07:00,991
Patriots recapture America within a few months

1615
01:07:01,247 --> 01:07:02,015
January 6th

1616
01:07:02,527 --> 01:07:04,319
They were doing so under the same name

1617
01:07:04,575 --> 01:07:05,343
Stop the steel

1618
01:07:05,599 --> 01:07:09,439
As the organization that Allie Alexander ran it was instrumental in planning the rally

1619
01:07:09,695 --> 01:07:10,207
At the Capitol

1620
01:07:10,463 --> 01:07:12,767
Have they switched most of their headlines to just like

1621
01:07:13,023 --> 01:07:13,535
Exhibit a

1622
01:07:13,791 --> 01:07:15,327
Exhibit

1623
01:07:16,095 --> 01:07:18,143
The video was from November 10th

1624
01:07:18,399 --> 01:07:22,495
If you consult Stewart's indictment you can see at this same time he was also a

1625
01:07:22,751 --> 01:07:23,775
Actively planning with you

1626
01:07:24,031 --> 01:07:25,823
Keepers to disrupt the election results

1627
01:07:26,591 --> 01:07:30,943
Quote on November 9th 2020 East Rhodes held a private GoToMeeting

1628
01:07:31,199 --> 01:07:34,783
And online conference calls

1629
01:07:35,039 --> 01:07:35,551

The operations leader for January 6th

1636

That's it

1637
01:07:54,495 --> 01:07:55,775
During the meeting roads outline

1638
01:07:56,031 --> 01:07:58,847
Plan to stop the lawful transfer of Presidential Power

1639
01:07:59,103 --> 01:08:00,895
Including preparations for the use of force

1640
01:08:01,407 --> 01:08:02,943
Innards those listening to

1641
01:08:04,223 --> 01:08:04,991
If I had to guess

1642
01:08:05,247 --> 01:08:08,831
The November rally in DC was too soon after the election to try and coordinate

1643
01:08:09,855 --> 01:08:13,183
There wasn't a fever pitch yet at that point since a lot of people were still hoping

1644
01:08:13,439 --> 01:08:15,487
But some kind of evidence of voter fraud 2 come out

1645
01:08:15,743 --> 01:08:16,511
And drop would still win

1646
01:08:17,279 --> 01:08:19,583
It wouldn't be optically good for Stewart

1647
01:08:19,839 --> 01:08:21,631
Use that rally as the jump point

1648
01:08:21,887 --> 01:08:22,911
And I guess

1649
01:08:23,167 --> 01:08:25,215
I had to guess he was probably using it for

1650
01:08:26,239 --> 01:08:27,263
There's another Exchange

1651
01:08:27,519 --> 01:08:28,799

01:08:37,759 --> 01:08:39,039
You taking into Washington

1657
01:08:39,295 --> 01:08:43,135
Did DC and coordinate planning with roads For an upcoming op in wash

1658
01:08:43,647 --> 01:08:44,159
10 BC

1659
01:08:44,671 --> 01:08:45,695
I would be surprised

1660
01:08:45,951 --> 01:08:47,231
Stuart knew well enough that this was

1661
01:08:47,487 --> 01:08:47,999
The time

1662
01:08:48,255 --> 01:08:48,767
But that rally

1663
01:08:49,023 --> 01:08:50,815
Could still be useful for PR purposes

1664
01:08:51,071 --> 01:08:51,839
And to get acquainted

1665
01:08:52,095 --> 01:08:52,607
North Capitol

1666
01:08:53,631 --> 01:08:54,911
Useful like March

1667
01:08:55,167 --> 01:08:55,935
Is a president

1668
01:08:56,191 --> 01:08:56,959
Kind of Porsche

1669
01:08:57,215 --> 01:09:00,287
For that

1670
01:09:00,799 --> 01:09:01,823
Looking at more

1671
01:09:02,079 --> 01:09:04,639
Videos on band a video there are multiple videos of

1672
01:09:04,895 --> 01:09:06,687
Store coming on to declare the sixth they plot

1673
01:09:06,943 --> 01:09:07,967
Talk to frame the Patriots

1674
01:09:08,223 --> 01:09:11,551
You can find the video from July 1st 2021 where is Harrison Smith

1675
01:09:11,807 --> 01:09:12,319
Defend Stewart

1676
01:09:12,575 --> 01:09:13,599
From accusations he's a fatty

1677
01:09:15,135 --> 01:09:17,439
Big gap between them and Stewart's arrest

1678
01:09:18,207 --> 01:09:20,767
I honestly find it difficult to believe that Stewart wasn't on a

1679
01:09:21,023 --> 01:09:22,559
Any of their shows between those dates

1680
01:09:22,815 --> 01:09:23,583
But I guess

1681
01:09:23,839 --> 01:09:24,351
Possible

1682
01:09:24,863 --> 01:09:26,911
I can definitely see Alex getting worried about the

1683
01:09:27,167 --> 01:09:29,727
The FedEx on him and throwing his friend of 30

1684
01:09:29,983 --> 01:09:31,007
18 years off to the side

1685
01:09:31,775 --> 01:09:32,287
Possible

1686
01:09:32,543 --> 01:09:33,567
But that's wild

1687
01:09:34,079 --> 01:09:39,199
Not only are there no results from Alex's own show but there are no results from Harrison show

1688
01:09:39,455 --> 01:09:40,735
Who went out of his way to debunked

1689
01:09:40,991 --> 01:09:41,759
Revolver articles

1690
01:09:42,015 --> 01:09:42,783
Spruce

1691
01:09:43,295 --> 01:09:44,575
Don't make sense at all to me

1692
01:09:45,599 --> 01:09:46,111
Weird

1693
01:09:46,623 --> 01:09:50,207
Can I watch the video and the only explanation I can come up with his

1694
01:09:51,999 --> 01:09:53,535
Who makes this joke about

1695
01:09:53,791 --> 01:09:54,303
If Stuart wants

1696
01:09:54,559 --> 01:09:55,071
Come on in Dubai

1697
01:09:55,583 --> 01:09:56,095
Pete Santilli

1698
01:09:56,863 --> 01:09:57,887
Stewart does look

1699
01:09:58,143 --> 01:09:59,935
Mad and he says know that you'll see him in

1700
01:10:00,703 --> 01:10:01,471
He still appears to be

1701
01:10:01,727 --> 01:10:02,239
We talkin

1702
01:10:02,751 --> 01:10:05,055
He doesn't look very happy while Alex quickly and

1703
01:10:06,079 --> 01:10:12,223
I can imagine that Stewart yelled at Alex after the show and is there cuz he was joking about the stuff that takes very seriously

1704
01:10:14,783 --> 01:10:15,807
Going to kick santilli's ass

1705
01:10:16,063 --> 01:10:16,575
Which Alex

1706
01:10:17,599 --> 01:10:18,367
Blitz torte was Galaga

1707
01:10:18,623 --> 01:10:19,903
Going to kick someone's ass

1708
01:10:20,159 --> 01:10:22,975
That happened after they stopped recording or after the inter

1709
01:10:23,231 --> 01:10:23,743
Go to bed

1710
01:10:24,767 --> 01:10:25,279
I have no idea

1711
01:10:25,791 --> 01:10:27,071
Is it a dead end

1712
01:10:29,119 --> 01:10:30,911
Until I saw one more thing on Van

1713
01:10:31,167 --> 01:10:31,679
Dog video

1714
01:10:32,447 --> 01:10:33,727
You

1715
01:10:33,983 --> 01:10:39,103
Are you Columbo and there's one more thing babe I video there was an interview

1716
01:10:39,359 --> 01:10:41,151
Stewart Rhodes did on July 12th

1717
01:10:41,407 --> 01:10:42,175
2021

1718
01:10:42,687 --> 01:10:43,711
10 days after hours

1719
01:10:43,967 --> 01:10:44,479
Has failed interview

1720
01:10:45,247 --> 01:10:51,391
This was with a just another Channel which correctly was a show on Rumble that followed Owen on the Caravan

1721
01:10:51,903 --> 01:10:53,695
And now I guess they have their own show on Alex

1722
01:10:54,463 --> 01:10:54,975
Great

1723
01:10:55,231 --> 01:10:55,743
Wow

1724
01:10:55,999 --> 01:10:56,767
The video is titled

1725
01:10:57,023 --> 01:10:59,071
Cook exclusive FBI allegation

1726
01:10:59,327 --> 01:11:02,143
Dusty roads clear the air or muddy the waters

1727
01:11:02,399 --> 01:11:03,679
America you decide

1728
01:11:04,447 --> 01:11:06,239
I got to thinking hey I'm America I should decide

1729
01:11:06,751 --> 01:11:07,519
You are America

1730
01:11:08,031 --> 01:11:09,567
I live in the whole interview it's dogshit

1731
01:11:10,079 --> 01:11:14,943
It just start saying the same kind of stuff that he'd said that as the cover Story the Alex interview

1732
01:11:16,223 --> 01:11:20,063
Way more clear that he thinks the whole thing about him being fat as a personal attack

1733
01:11:20,319 --> 01:11:21,855
Pete Santilli

1734
01:11:22,111 --> 01:11:26,207
Really clears gets madder and madder about Pete Santilli

1735
01:11:26,463 --> 01:11:28,511
Maybe one might say a kind of

1736
01:11:29,023 --> 01:11:31,839
Moving one's Anger from yourself

1737
01:11:32,095 --> 01:11:34,143
To another to really be insist

1738
01:11:34,399 --> 01:11:35,935
Until he has a crush on him

1739
01:11:37,983 --> 01:11:39,775
However it in all that like

1740
01:11:40,031 --> 01:11:40,799
Ignorable nonsense

1741
01:11:41,055 --> 01:11:44,383
There's One Moment of clarity in this interview that I need to bring up

1742
01:11:44,639 --> 01:11:45,407
2nd episode

1743
01:11:45,663 --> 01:11:46,431
And this is my brother

1744
01:11:46,687 --> 01:11:47,455
This is your bright spot

1745
01:11:47,711 --> 01:11:49,503
The interview is being conducted by a host

1746
01:11:49,759 --> 01:11:52,319
Just another channel name Brandon

1747
01:11:52,831 --> 01:11:54,111
He's joined by a co-host

1748
01:11:54,367 --> 01:11:56,415
Name Jeremy who he disguised himself

1749
01:11:56,671 --> 01:11:57,183
Is an oath keeper

1750
01:11:57,695 --> 01:12:02,303
Hayden Stewart in a woman named Angel whose husband is one of The Oath Keepers who got arrested

1751
01:12:02,559 --> 01:12:03,327
In the first indictment

1752
01:12:03,583 --> 01:12:04,351
Kenneth Harrelson

1753
01:12:04,863 --> 01:12:05,887
Who's also now charged with

1754
01:12:06,655 --> 01:12:08,447
Wow

1755
01:12:08,959 --> 01:12:14,847
The whole time does Jeremy guys are going on and on about how The Oath Keepers are totally cool

1756
01:12:15,103 --> 01:12:16,383
Which is what I would expect

1757
01:12:17,407 --> 01:12:19,967
He's openly bragging about being there on the 6th

1758
01:12:20,223 --> 01:12:25,343
And haven't bought brought weapons to the stash spot being a bit confrontational that if you ask me

1759
01:12:25,855 --> 01:12:27,391
It all comes to a head in this clip

1760
01:12:28,671 --> 01:12:29,183
Is the thing that

1761
01:12:29,439 --> 01:12:29,951
Is Moe's

1762
01:12:31,487 --> 01:12:32,511
Disingenuous

1763
01:12:32,767 --> 01:12:33,279
Tumi

1764
01:12:34,047 --> 01:12:34,559
Is that

1765
01:12:35,071 --> 01:12:36,095
All the footage that has

1766
01:12:36,351 --> 01:12:37,119
Has been released of that

1767
01:12:37,375 --> 01:12:37,887
Hotel room

1768
01:12:38,143 --> 01:12:39,167
They have that same footage

1769
01:12:40,447 --> 01:12:41,471
The list

1770
01:12:41,727 --> 01:12:42,751
Of lodging

1771
01:12:43,519 --> 01:12:45,567
I believe that my lodging

1772
01:12:46,079 --> 01:12:46,847
Which was a RV

1773
01:12:47,103 --> 01:12:47,871
A park 10 miles

1774
01:12:48,127 --> 01:12:48,895
Outside of

1775
01:12:49,151 --> 01:12:49,663
DC

1776
01:12:49,919 --> 01:12:50,687
In College Park

1777
01:12:50,943 --> 01:12:52,223
Is literally redacted

1778
01:12:52,735 --> 01:12:54,271
And it's because

1779
01:12:54,783 --> 01:12:56,319
I know they tried to read

1780
01:12:56,575 --> 01:12:57,087
Recruit me

1781
01:12:57,599 --> 01:12:58,111
Info

1782
01:12:58,623 --> 01:12:59,903
That's why I continually say

1783
01:13:00,159 --> 01:13:00,671
City people date

1784
01:13:00,927 --> 01:13:02,975
Intentionally or ignoring my

1785
01:13:03,487 --> 01:13:03,999
Dissipation

1786
01:13:04,511 --> 01:13:05,279
In January

1787
01:13:06,559 --> 01:13:07,071
Because

1788
01:13:08,351 --> 01:13:09,631
My testimony

1789
01:13:09,887 --> 01:13:11,423
Completely blows their entire

1790
01:13:11,935 --> 01:13:12,703
Bulshit

1791
01:13:12,959 --> 01:13:13,471
Narrative

1792
01:13:13,727 --> 01:13:14,239
Out of the water

1793
01:13:14,495 --> 01:13:15,775
Because I said in on these meetings

1794
01:13:16,031 --> 01:13:16,799
I was there

1795
01:13:17,311 --> 01:13:18,079
The night before

1796
01:13:18,335 --> 01:13:19,871
Or I was there on January 5th

1797
01:13:20,127 --> 01:13:21,407
I had guns

1798
01:13:21,919 --> 01:13:22,943
In that hotel room

1799
01:13:23,455 --> 01:13:25,503
I was on the video camera

1800
01:13:26,015 --> 01:13:27,807
Picking up my guns next day

1801
01:13:31,135 --> 01:13:33,951
Jeremy Brown

1802
01:13:34,207 --> 01:13:34,975
Isabelle to you

1803
01:13:35,231 --> 01:13:37,279
He's my favorite insurrectionist I think if I had

1804
01:13:37,535 --> 01:13:38,303
Massachusetts

1805
01:13:38,559 --> 01:13:41,631
So this video is recorded on July 12th

1806
01:13:41,887 --> 01:13:42,655
Turn on

1807
01:13:42,911 --> 01:13:44,447
September 30th Jeremy was arrested

1808
01:13:44,703 --> 01:13:49,055
Remaining at any restricted building or grounds that lawful Authority

1809
01:13:49,567 --> 01:13:51,871
And knowingly and with intent to impede

1810
01:13:52,127 --> 01:13:55,711
Or disrupt the orderly conduct of government business or official functions

1811
01:13:55,967 --> 01:13:56,991
Engaged disorderly artist

1812
01:13:57,247 --> 01:13:57,759
Tropicante

1813
01:13:58,015 --> 01:13:58,527
Restrict

1814
01:13:58,783 --> 01:13:59,295
To building a rat

1815
01:14:00,575 --> 01:14:05,695
It's not just a Cockiness of the Icarus Style flying too close to the Sun that makes Jeremy my favorite though

1816
01:14:06,207 --> 01:14:07,999
He's the stupidest a****** in the world

1817
01:14:08,767 --> 01:14:10,047
When Jeremy was arrested

1818
01:14:10,303 --> 01:14:11,071
Naturally his house

1819
01:14:11,839 --> 01:14:13,375
And cops found about so what you do

1820
01:14:14,143 --> 01:14:18,239
Tons of ammo and dicey guns like sawed-off shotgun do it also to hand

1821
01:14:18,751 --> 01:14:19,263
Yeah I was going

1822
01:14:19,519 --> 01:14:20,287
Going to say there's definitely any

1823
01:14:20,543 --> 01:14:21,055
Explosive or two

1824
01:14:21,311 --> 01:14:23,359
The reality is that he probably would

1825
01:14:23,615 --> 01:14:24,127
Ended up getting

1826
01:14:24,383 --> 01:14:25,407
How much time for Zach

1827
01:14:25,663 --> 01:14:26,943
Cuz I'm 6

1828
01:14:27,199 --> 01:14:27,711
Restaurants

1829
01:14:28,223 --> 01:14:29,759
7 grenades is not great

1830
01:14:30,527 --> 01:14:31,807
In 2020 I do got some

1831
01:14:32,319 --> 01:14:32,831
31 months

1832
01:14:33,087 --> 01:14:36,671
Without the correct paperwork so Jeremy might be in

1833
01:14:37,695 --> 01:14:38,719
Better

1834
01:14:39,231 --> 01:14:40,511
Before he got arrested

1835
01:14:40,767 --> 01:14:44,351
Put his house for sale on Zillow and was apparently going to be living in an RV

1836
01:14:45,119 --> 01:14:48,447
Picture of a whiteboard in Lizella list

1837
01:14:48,703 --> 01:14:54,847
Thing which included a bit of incriminating information

1838
01:14:56,895 --> 01:15:01,503
Incriminating information about it about what weapons he had on hand

1839
01:15:02,271 --> 01:15:03,807
Including flashback switch

1840
01:15:04,063 --> 01:15:06,623
Definitely wouldn't be legal for him to have on hand

1841
01:15:07,391 --> 01:15:08,159
It's also introduced

1842
01:15:08,415 --> 01:15:09,439
The new problem for Jared

1843
01:15:10,207 --> 01:15:12,255
This picture claimed to show that he had weapons

1844
01:15:12,511 --> 01:15:15,071
Including flashbangs which were not found by the cops

1845
01:15:15,327 --> 01:15:15,839
Lobster in the search

1846
01:15:16,351 --> 01:15:18,399
Which would imply or provide probable

1847
01:15:18,655 --> 01:15:19,423
Cause to suspect

1848
01:15:19,935 --> 01:15:20,703
Becky moved them

1849
01:15:21,215 --> 01:15:21,983
And it turns out

1850
01:15:22,239 --> 01:15:22,751
Transporting

1851
01:15:23,007 --> 01:15:23,519
Explosives is a

1852
01:15:23,775 --> 01:15:24,287
Crime

1853
01:15:24,799 --> 01:15:26,847
The federal agent actually had to type this out

1854
01:15:27,359 --> 01:15:28,895
Start my training

1855
01:15:29,151 --> 01:15:30,687
Expertise General familiarity with

1856
01:15:30,943 --> 01:15:35,807
Small confines of an RV the fact that the trailer was purchased approximately a month ago and sits next

1857
01:15:36,063 --> 01:15:37,855
To the RV and the house within the proper

1858
01:15:38,111 --> 01:15:40,159
And that it's unlikely that an a

1859
01:15:40,415 --> 01:15:42,719
Individual with Market at home available for public

1860
01:15:42,975 --> 01:15:43,743
Inspection with guns and

1861
01:15:43,999 --> 01:15:45,023
Explosives inside the home

1862
01:15:45,791 --> 01:15:47,327
It's probable that many of brown

1863
01:15:47,583 --> 01:15:50,655
Possessions including Electronics guns ammunition in Opelousas

1864
01:15:50,911 --> 01:15:52,191
Which constitute potential Evan

1865
01:15:52,447 --> 01:15:53,215
Into this investigation

1866
01:15:53,471 --> 01:15:54,751
Has been moved to the RV or

1867
01:15:56,287 --> 01:16:02,431
That's a really long way of explaining something very clear

1868
01:16:02,687 --> 01:16:07,295
But they weren't there so maybe they're next door also because it's fun

1869
01:16:07,551 --> 01:16:13,695
The FBI search warrant also says that the agent publicly-available video podcast

1870
01:16:13,951 --> 01:16:14,975
A person one

1871
01:16:15,487 --> 01:16:17,279
In an interview posted on July 12th

1872
01:16:17,535 --> 01:16:20,351
2021 Broadway

1873
01:16:20,607 --> 01:16:22,143
Bookkeepers HUD January 6th

1874
01:16:22,399 --> 01:16:23,423
There prior to the riots

1875
01:16:23,679 --> 01:16:28,031
He deposited guns with other of Keepers in Virginia and retrieve them after the riots

1876
01:16:29,055 --> 01:16:30,335
I would not have

1877
01:16:30,591 --> 01:16:36,223
Admitted to a potentially that's a 100 years ago executable crime

1878
01:16:36,479 --> 01:16:38,527
Definitely

1879
01:16:39,039 --> 01:16:40,831
This video that

1880
01:16:41,343 --> 01:16:42,367
He did with your roads

1881
01:16:43,135 --> 01:16:43,903
Probable cause

1882
01:16:44,159 --> 01:16:45,695
In the FBI search

1883
01:16:47,999 --> 01:16:48,767
By God

1884
01:16:49,535 --> 01:16:55,679
He's insisting on taking his case to trial so we can blow this whole thing wide open so I look forward to that Gustav fizzling out display

1885
01:16:55,935 --> 01:16:56,447
Morning Lee

1886
01:16:56,703 --> 01:17:00,287
He claimed that the FBI tried to make him an informant

1887
01:17:00,543 --> 01:17:01,311
Or whatever

1888
01:17:01,567 --> 01:17:02,591
And

1889
01:17:02,847 --> 01:17:04,639
From what I can understand

1890
01:17:04,895 --> 01:17:05,919
From the allegations

1891
01:17:06,431 --> 01:17:07,455
There was

1892
01:17:07,711 --> 01:17:08,991
A visit that he got

1893
01:17:09,503 --> 01:17:11,039
From the FBI at some point

1894
01:17:11,295 --> 01:17:11,807
About

1895
01:17:12,063 --> 01:17:13,087
Shouldn't use posting online

1896
01:17:13,343 --> 01:17:13,855
Which

1897
01:17:14,111 --> 01:17:15,903
Based on the other things I can tell about him

1898
01:17:16,671 --> 01:17:17,951
Maybe he made a threat

1899
01:17:18,207 --> 01:17:19,743
Of some sort that was relevant enough

1900
01:17:20,511 --> 01:17:23,583
As as somebody who's a member of The Oath Keepers unlike a former

1901
01:17:24,607 --> 01:17:27,679
Green Beret apparently

1902
01:17:27,935 --> 01:17:29,471
Play Michael Irvin

1903
01:17:31,007 --> 01:17:31,519
People taking us

1904
01:17:31,775 --> 01:17:32,287
The credible threat

1905
01:17:32,799 --> 01:17:34,591
I don't know exactly what the case is about that

1906
01:17:34,847 --> 01:17:35,615
And I can find

1907
01:17:36,639 --> 01:17:37,151
Blogs

1908
01:17:38,175 --> 01:17:38,943
That he released

1909
01:17:39,199 --> 01:17:39,967
Video

1910
01:17:40,991 --> 01:17:42,015
Record

1911
01:17:42,271 --> 01:17:46,367
Bfbi trying to make him an informant

1912
01:17:46,623 --> 01:17:48,671
The Oath Keepers

1913
01:17:50,463 --> 01:17:50,975
Video

1914
01:17:51,231 --> 01:17:55,327
And apparently it was supposed to have been played in an interview with just another Channel

1915
01:17:56,095 --> 01:17:57,119
So I'll know

1916
01:18:02,239 --> 01:18:03,775
By the justanotherpanel

1917
01:18:04,287 --> 01:18:05,055
It's not on the

1918
01:18:05,567 --> 01:18:08,383
So if it was on there it's been since

1919
01:18:08,639 --> 01:18:12,991
Don't know where I don't really believe necessarily what's going on here

1920
01:18:13,247 --> 01:18:15,551
But I do believe that he posted on Zillow that he had a

1921
01:18:16,063 --> 01:18:18,367
I mean this is just

1922
01:18:19,903 --> 01:18:22,975
It's just a bad movie it's like a it's like a heist movie

1923
01:18:23,487 --> 01:18:24,767
Where does weakest link

1924
01:18:25,023 --> 01:18:25,791
Is glycol

1925
01:18:26,047 --> 01:18:30,399
I'd suddenly spending 10 million dollars immediately after they did the heist

1926
01:18:30,655 --> 01:18:32,703
You're the one who's getting this caught man

1927
01:18:36,031 --> 01:18:37,823
This is why if I'm doing conspiracies

1928
01:18:38,079 --> 01:18:38,847
Alright

1929
01:18:39,359 --> 01:18:41,407
I'm not doing it with any of these

1930
01:18:41,919 --> 01:18:45,503
I'm too I think I'm only going to go with like

1931
01:18:47,551 --> 01:18:53,695
I guess cartoon characters who are used to stealing like the Hamburglar sure number one in my conspiracy who are you

1932
01:18:54,719 --> 01:18:56,255
Oh really a conspiracy charge

1933
01:18:59,583 --> 01:19:01,375
I want to go with verbal Kint

1934
01:19:01,631 --> 01:19:06,239
Verbal Kint

1935
01:19:06,495 --> 01:19:07,775
Spotless record

1936
01:19:09,567 --> 01:19:12,127
Did doesn't crack under pressure

1937
01:19:12,383 --> 01:19:16,991
Absolutely that's buddy the the Kobayashi

1938
01:19:18,015 --> 01:19:19,295
Private my first round pick

1939
01:19:20,319 --> 01:19:21,087
The trick to conspiracy

1940
01:19:21,599 --> 01:19:22,111
Makeup

1941
01:19:22,367 --> 01:19:23,903
Nobody even alive

1942
01:19:24,159 --> 01:19:29,535
So you got the Hamburglar okay

1943
01:19:34,655 --> 01:19:36,191
One of the spies that was X

1944
01:19:36,447 --> 01:19:37,215
Executed in the 40s

1945
01:19:37,471 --> 01:19:38,751
PS4

1946
01:19:39,519 --> 01:19:42,335
Nevermind I'm going to go with a walk to the water

1947
01:19:42,847 --> 01:19:43,359
Do you can't have

1948
01:19:43,871 --> 01:19:44,895
Okay I have a lot to

1949
01:19:46,943 --> 01:19:48,735
Google hamburger

1950
01:19:51,807 --> 01:19:54,879
Their rules are rules are changing

1951
01:19:55,391 --> 01:20:01,535
Okay overpowered pronounce okay nobody with superpowers

1952
01:20:01,791 --> 01:20:04,351
Thinking somebody who'd be really good at

1953
01:20:05,631 --> 01:20:06,655
Not getting involved

1954
01:20:06,911 --> 01:20:08,703
When things I don't want them involved in

1955
01:20:08,959 --> 01:20:11,007
And maybe having a lot of information that there

1956
01:20:11,263 --> 01:20:11,775
Disposal

1957
01:20:12,031 --> 01:20:14,080
I was also trying to think of somebody who's maybe a mute

1958
01:20:14,848 --> 01:20:16,128
That's not a bad

1959
01:20:19,200 --> 01:20:21,248
Chooses not to speak

1960
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:27,904
I think would be like maybe some kind of a punk type Greaseman like an Ocean's 11

1961
01:20:28,160 --> 01:20:30,464
You've got you've got the acrobat

1962
01:20:30,720 --> 01:20:32,768
The Chinese acrobat guy who only speaks

1963
01:20:33,024 --> 01:20:35,584
In Chinese and everybody understands him and it's kind of a joke

1964
01:20:36,096 --> 01:20:36,864
No

1965
01:20:37,120 --> 01:20:38,400
You don't want to

1966
01:20:38,656 --> 01:20:41,216
You don't want to inexplicably be able to understand Chinese

1967
01:20:41,728 --> 01:20:42,496
April

1968
01:20:42,752 --> 01:20:45,568
No I prefer I prefer somebody who

1969
01:20:46,080 --> 01:20:47,104
Will not snatch

1970
01:20:47,360 --> 01:20:48,128
Because they don't

1971
01:20:48,640 --> 01:20:53,248
Okay whether willingly or

1972
01:20:56,064 --> 01:20:57,088
I know the joke you're making

1973
01:21:01,696 --> 01:21:04,512
Appreciate that

1974
01:21:07,840 --> 01:21:10,656
The reason I have a Paws bear is because

1975
01:21:11,168 --> 01:21:17,312
She is not saying she doesn't speak the boyfriend of the song

1976
01:21:17,568 --> 01:21:23,456
Sister is I would have liked to track the logic of the joke of like who would I drafted message

1977
01:21:23,712 --> 01:21:24,736
Was it the bassist

1978
01:21:25,248 --> 01:21:26,016
I don't know

1979
01:21:28,320 --> 01:21:30,112
Who cares

1980
01:21:30,368 --> 01:21:35,744
My-oh-my Brightspot terrorist who posts

1981
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:37,536
Plans on Zillow accidentally

1982
01:21:37,792 --> 01:21:39,840
Just an amazing amazing individual

1983
01:21:40,096 --> 01:21:42,400
Mystery Still Remains of why Alex

1984
01:21:42,656 --> 01:21:43,168
Wooden post

1985
01:21:43,680 --> 01:21:46,752
Other than like offending Pete Santilli

1986
01:21:47,264 --> 01:21:48,288
I can't see what

1987
01:21:48,544 --> 01:21:50,336
Exactly Alex saw that was threatening

1988
01:21:50,592 --> 01:21:51,872
Interview

1989
01:21:52,128 --> 01:21:53,664
It seems to me that it

1990
01:21:54,176 --> 01:21:56,480
More likely bet Stewart sets

1991
01:21:57,504 --> 01:21:58,016
After work

1992
01:21:58,272 --> 01:22:02,880
The steward said something afterwards or something it was like I don't I don't want

1993
01:22:03,648 --> 01:22:05,184
What do you think Alex would respect

1994
01:22:05,696 --> 01:22:06,464
That's a good question

1995
01:22:06,976 --> 01:22:11,840
But also has no his buddy was ready to kill the president

1996
01:22:12,096 --> 01:22:13,376
Are the vice president

1997
01:22:13,632 --> 01:22:15,680
He also he also got to consider

1998
01:22:16,704 --> 01:22:18,240
The possibility that

1999
01:22:18,752 --> 01:22:20,288
Stewart said don't post that

2000
01:22:20,800 --> 01:22:21,824
That led to a fight

2001
01:22:22,080 --> 01:22:23,360
And that's why I Stewart haven't been on

2002
01:22:23,872 --> 01:22:24,384
That's true

2003
01:22:24,640 --> 01:22:25,152
That's awesome

2004
01:22:26,944 --> 01:22:27,968
I'm something else to do and it ruined

2005
01:22:28,224 --> 01:22:29,504
Is July 4th

2006
01:22:30,272 --> 01:22:30,784
Are deducted

2007
01:22:31,040 --> 01:22:31,552
Joe Brown

2008
01:22:31,808 --> 01:22:33,600
You got to think about this in terms of like

2009
01:22:34,880 --> 01:22:40,256
Real-time yeah I don't know I really I really find this

2010
01:22:40,512 --> 01:22:41,792
To be kind of an open question

2011
01:22:42,816 --> 01:22:43,584
Like why this wouldn't

2012
01:22:46,400 --> 01:22:46,912
Pet store

2013
01:22:48,192 --> 01:22:48,960
Possible

2014
01:22:49,216 --> 01:22:50,496
But then again

2015
01:22:50,752 --> 01:22:55,872
He 10 days later doing it every recess almost the same thing with a smaller channel on Bandai video

2016
01:22:56,128 --> 01:22:56,896
It seems like he was in

2017
01:22:57,152 --> 01:22:57,664
Consistent

2018
01:22:57,920 --> 01:22:58,688
His message app

2019
01:22:59,968 --> 01:23:02,784
The other possibility like I said is like

2020
01:23:03,296 --> 01:23:05,600
Alex does have Pete Santilli on

2021
01:23:06,112 --> 01:23:07,648
It really has a bit

2022
01:23:07,904 --> 01:23:10,976
In the past possible that he doesn't want to start beef

2023
01:23:11,232 --> 01:23:12,512
Somebody who's a little bit

2024
01:23:12,768 --> 01:23:15,840
Closer to being accepted by the mainstream of the right-wing

2025
01:23:16,096 --> 01:23:16,864
Where is stewardess

2026
01:23:17,376 --> 01:23:17,888
Frenzy friend

2027
01:23:18,144 --> 01:23:19,936
She doesn't want to get into another pechenik

2028
01:23:22,752 --> 01:23:24,032
Stay the night

2029
01:23:24,288 --> 01:23:28,640
Tell me neither of them are employees but yet maybe that would be too much of

2030
01:23:29,152 --> 01:23:30,432
Try to take sides

2031
01:23:32,224 --> 01:23:32,736
I don't know

2032
01:23:32,992 --> 01:23:35,040
I think more importantly

2033
01:23:35,296 --> 01:23:36,064
If you listen to this

2034
01:23:36,576 --> 01:23:37,088
He find

2035
01:23:38,112 --> 01:23:38,624
Just

2036
01:23:38,880 --> 01:23:39,392
Pathetic

2037
01:23:41,440 --> 01:23:41,952
Control

2038
01:23:42,208 --> 01:23:43,232
And coming up with him

2039
01:23:43,488 --> 01:23:44,000
Excuses.

2040
01:23:44,256 --> 01:23:45,536
Dad

2041
01:23:46,560 --> 01:23:48,608
Compelling to Alex's audience No Doubt

2042
01:23:48,864 --> 01:23:51,168
Of course especially without any other information

2043
01:23:51,424 --> 01:23:52,192
To contradict

2044
01:23:52,448 --> 01:23:53,216
Things that you saying

2045
01:23:53,472 --> 01:23:53,984
That are clearly

2046
01:23:54,240 --> 01:23:55,776
I mean the thing that gets me

2047
01:23:56,544 --> 01:23:57,056
Is that

2048
01:23:57,824 --> 01:24:00,640
They have watch Stewart Roads go on Infowars

2049
01:24:01,152 --> 01:24:01,664
4 years

2050
01:24:02,688 --> 01:24:04,224
Calling for violent Acts

2051
01:24:04,736 --> 01:24:06,272
And then they're going to just

2052
01:24:06,528 --> 01:24:09,088
Except it all by the way Stuart roads was all about medic

2053
01:24:10,112 --> 01:24:11,904
Why only

2054
01:24:12,160 --> 01:24:13,696
Selfless

2055
01:24:14,720 --> 01:24:18,304
I don't know if we'll see what happens but you know we'll check it again

2056
01:24:18,560 --> 01:24:19,584
Until then we went

2057
01:24:19,840 --> 01:24:25,216
We do it smells right.com we aren't

2058
01:24:25,472 --> 01:24:27,520
But until then I'm Nino and Leo Abby the Explorer

2059
01:24:35,200 --> 01:24:36,224
Alex

2060
01:24:36,480 --> 01:24:38,784
Christian color with huge fan I love your work
