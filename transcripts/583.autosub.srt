1
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:20,736
Air Jordan 5 sweat it

2
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:27,136
I have great respect for knowledge by knowledge

3
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:56,320
Knowledge fight

4
00:00:56,576 --> 00:01:02,720
Dot-com

5
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:09,120
Surround

6
00:01:09,376 --> 00:01:10,144
Attitude the Run

7
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,216
Bio of dudes

8
00:01:13,472 --> 00:01:14,496
Apple David

9
00:01:14,752 --> 00:01:16,544
The Peabody and Sherman of podcasting

10
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:19,616
I think that might be the only accurate way to describe us

11
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:26,016
So beware the Peabody and Sherman of podcast and we worked with the others lean and Doug little bit about Alex Jones

12
00:01:26,272 --> 00:01:31,648
Doesn't roll off my tongue as well as I hoped it was the Peabody & Sherman

13
00:01:31,904 --> 00:01:32,672
Peabody and Sherman

14
00:01:32,928 --> 00:01:37,536
Dog

15
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,608
There's no way I'm mr. Peabody

16
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:41,376
Just skip that part

17
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:45,216
Jordan what's up

18
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:45,984
Dustin Poirier

19
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:49,056
What's your bright spot today

20
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:51,616
I hate don't call it a comeback

21
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:57,504
I guess my bright spot has been I really have enjoyed over the time that you've been on

22
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,040
Flygon

23
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:00,576
Making buttons I've gotten

24
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:02,624
None of them sent out in his

25
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,160
Is a ton more to send out

26
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:10,560
Course and I would just like to give this way with little reminder to everyone that if you've not heard back from the email

27
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:13,632
I can't respond to all these emails

28
00:02:13,888 --> 00:02:20,032
There are way too many for a way more than I expected it to be more than last time but they're all be

29
00:02:20,544 --> 00:02:21,056
Sent out

30
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:26,176
It's 1 I'm not complaining to be able to give

31
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:28,480
I give to Tom people

32
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:31,040
It's not like biting off more than you can chew it's like

33
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:37,184
Picking out a buffet and deciding that it's going to take a few weeks to finish the entire goddamn Buffet but yeah

34
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,232
Eat that goddamn Buffet

35
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:44,864
Yeah I kind of think that's how I'm looking at it

36
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:45,888
And give me the

37
00:02:46,144 --> 00:02:46,656
Excuse to watch

38
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:53,056
Bunch of Survivor why you were gone and so I would like to say that

39
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:54,336
Really

40
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:58,176
Wow I thought you were going to that you were telling me that it was about to

41
00:02:58,432 --> 00:03:04,576
To fall off the cliff you would seem the future coming and it was going to be a disaster they introduced Exile Island and then

42
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:08,416
And also they introduced the hidden immunity idol and he's are signs of bad things

43
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:14,816
For sure I will tell you this

44
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:16,096
Way too many twists

45
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:17,120
Start

46
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:23,264
Were they start throwing curveballs for no reason like you can't plan from episode 2 episode like

47
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:27,104
I don't even know if his give me my tribe tomorrow

48
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:34,272
It's outrageous that you're on The Bachelorette

49
00:03:34,528 --> 00:03:38,880
But season 13 was the one that starts out divided by race

50
00:03:39,648 --> 00:03:40,672
Ukiah and the

51
00:03:41,952 --> 00:03:45,792
Yeah they start with an African American tribe and Asian American tribe

52
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:46,816
A white

53
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:50,656
Tribe

54
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:51,424
Wild

55
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,704
Edit

56
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:53,728
Not

57
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:55,776
Comfortable at first

58
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:05,504
It's 2005-2006 might get away with that s*** someone thought it was a great

59
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:10,880
Good idea and it like maybe it would prompt conversation

60
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:13,184
Yeah it doesn't

61
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:16,256
It's bad it's beginning

62
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:18,559
The story that developed the middle of the

63
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:19,839
The season throughout is

64
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:21,119
Maybe one of the mower

65
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:23,935
Compelling things I've seen all that show

66
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:25,983
I don't want to spoil anything but it's

67
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:27,519
Styx gets Highmark

68
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:29,567
I think a lot of people would hate it if you spoiled something

69
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:31,871
Sing from 16 years ago

70
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:33,919
Fair enough

71
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:38,783
What about you what's your birthday

72
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:41,343
You know I had a absolutely fantastic

73
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:42,623
Isaac Tripp

74
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:44,415
It was astonishing

75
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:48,767
Waterfalls I climbed

76
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:49,791
Goddamn

77
00:04:50,047 --> 00:04:51,327
2 mi long

78
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:53,631
But it was

79
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:56,703
We're from here where there's no high

80
00:04:58,239 --> 00:05:00,543
Yeah concrete everywhere

81
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:03,359
If they're up whenever I got up there I could

82
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:05,919
Could see other things from like further away

83
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:11,295
Reminds me of season of Survivor where they went up on a hill

84
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:14,111
Nobody was

85
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:15,135
Triplets great

86
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:19,231
Give me back my bright spot is I feel like life is bright

87
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:20,511
Yeah that's good

88
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:24,095
That's always a nice things to reclaim after a vacation

89
00:05:24,351 --> 00:05:28,959
Dogs again I'm sure they were quite messy

90
00:05:29,215 --> 00:05:30,495
A****** when they saw me

91
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:32,287
This morning pick them up

92
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:38,687
Jumped into my face baby been off half of my beard it was brutal anyway you got it

93
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:41,247
Folks

94
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:44,063
We when we last left

95
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:48,159
Serialized show

96
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:55,583
So are we going to finally figure out who shot Jr been not feeling all that well it was not

97
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:59,935
That huge of a deal I did get tested for covid never thing is all

98
00:06:00,191 --> 00:06:00,703
-7

99
00:06:00,959 --> 00:06:02,239
I am and what have you

100
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:07,615
And the only reason I bring this back up is because you never coming back here on a Wednesday and I really hope

101
00:06:07,871 --> 00:06:09,919
That we would have been able to record some stuff

102
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:11,455
Before your vacation

103
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:13,503
And then have it too

104
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:15,039
Smooth

105
00:06:15,295 --> 00:06:17,855
Things out on either end of it but

106
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:24,511
Because I was not feeling well we weren't able to and I appreciate everybody being understanding

107
00:06:24,767 --> 00:06:30,911
I listened to the episode there's a delight to meet Jared

108
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:33,215
Sorry sorry I missed that

109
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:36,287
I had a couple it was weird listening to you guys talk because

110
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:40,895
I was listening as I was there and I was like who I got something funny

111
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:43,455
I can't say it

112
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:44,223
Brutal

113
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:49,599
Another thing that's interesting is

114
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:51,391
We might be witches

115
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:54,975
Alex

116
00:06:57,535 --> 00:06:58,047
No

117
00:06:58,303 --> 00:07:00,095
Nope nope unacceptable

118
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:01,887
I refuse

119
00:07:02,143 --> 00:07:02,911
I refuse

120
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:03,935
Then

121
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:05,471
Prior to this show

122
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:08,543
Prior to the show the number of coincidences

123
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:11,359
Coincidences per month

124
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:12,127
Very low

125
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:18,527
Right now it seems our schedules matchup in

126
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:25,183
When we don't really announce these things all that far in advance is upsetting Italy

127
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:30,303
I don't like it so yeah there wasn't actually all that much to deal with in terms of Alex last week

128
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:31,583
So would have been

129
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:32,351
You know

130
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:33,887
No-man's-land Dwight

131
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:35,167
We are back

132
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:36,959
Discussing

133
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:38,751
First one

134
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:41,567
This is the Sunday

135
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:42,591
Sunday

136
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:43,359
Episode

137
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:44,639
Very exciting

138
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:50,527
Stuff to go over but before we get to that door and let's take a look-see hello

150
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:27,647

First metal bender

00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:35,071
They do a whole nice professional wrestling thing and Mick Foley

154
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:36,095
Plays the boulder

155
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:39,423
And does a full-on inov wrestling you got

156
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,983
Really excited that Mick Foley was a nozzy

157
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:46,335
I'm in the other Avatar

158
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:47,103
So how

159
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:52,479
I've listened to both of your god-awful movie episodes twice bring on more bad movies

160
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:54,015
Thank you so much right now if you want

161
00:08:57,599 --> 00:08:59,903
So what's up

162
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:00,927
Quokka the games out

163
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:15,519
Money off that heroin

164
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:20,127
Is freakishly large

165
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:23,967
Transtech Walker

166
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:24,991
Thank you very much

167
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:26,015
Also

168
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:27,551
Update

169
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:30,879
It's two additions to selene's family

170
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:31,903
To say thank you so much

171
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:32,671
Fukt

172
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:35,231
Who adopted a blue-footed booby

173
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:37,023
Cuz it needed some feathers

174
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:45,215
Play exciting movie.

175
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:47,263
For every time we do something it whines

176
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:48,543
Spiraling out of control

177
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:51,615
I think this one might get us

178
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:52,383
To Arc

179
00:09:52,639 --> 00:09:57,759
Levels of out-of-control eventually everyone's going to realize that

180
00:09:58,015 --> 00:10:03,903
The only way we're going to make it through this is if we have two of every animal in the Gulf of Celine that's just looking to have to happen

181
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:08,511
Let's not let it get to that point but we do appreciate people adopting

182
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:15,423
Start here on Sunday here's where Alex is at

186
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:29,503
Jean King headline

187
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:33,599
The British government officially warned

188
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:35,903
That

189
00:10:39,231 --> 00:10:40,511
2.6

190
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:42,303
Billion plus

191
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:43,327
People

192
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:49,983
Here we go

193
00:10:50,495 --> 00:10:51,263
Whenever you're ready

194
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:53,567
2.6 billion

195
00:10:53,823 --> 00:10:54,335
People

196
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:57,151
Die

197
00:10:58,687 --> 00:10:59,967
As a result

198
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:02,527
The

199
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:05,855
Mutations coming from

200
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:06,879
The so-called

201
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:08,671
Covid-19 vaccine

202
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:10,207
What

203
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:11,743
We modified injection

204
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:14,815
India is

205
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:18,911
It really letting it slip wow wow okay

206
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:21,983
Did you hear this story while you're on vacation feel like you

207
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:28,383
You missed this week the British press has been like 2.6 billion going to die

208
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:33,503
Florida. Would it come out of nowhere that deliver the news

209
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:40,159
I want to just talk about an article here in the Daily Mail that discusses a recent comments from the UK scientific advisory

210
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:40,927
For emergency

211
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:43,231
Also known as Sage

212
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:48,095
They warned that the possibility of a mutation occurring they could make covid as deadly as murderers

213
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:50,143
Quote of realistic

214
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:50,911
Possibility

215
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:55,263
The part that Alex is completely ignoring about the article is the part where it also says

216
00:11:56,031 --> 00:12:01,919
The sage report also claimed it was equally realistic that covid will mutate to become less lethal over time

217
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:05,247
So

218
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:08,063
Coming from the sage counsel future

219
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:08,831
Uncertain

220
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:12,927
Yes could be good that's fine

221
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:15,999
This is the paper that encouraged the UK government to that given to

222
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:21,119
Complacency because at this point there's really no way to know how covid going to evolve in the future

223
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:23,167
The part about vaccines creating

224
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:26,495
The mutations is just a simple misrepresentation of a single line in

225
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:28,287
Bastille email article that says quote

226
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:34,687
It at the outside of Britain's hugely successful vaccination Drive the team warned the country is greater levels of immunity May helps

227
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:35,711
Speed up the viruses

228
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:36,991
Evolutionary process

229
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:39,039
This isn't saying that vaccines

230
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:40,063
Increase mutation

231
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:42,623
That's just Alex's made-up version to what that means

232
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:45,439
It's clear if you read the underlying report that this is a ref

233
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:46,975
To the phenomenon known as selection

234
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:49,279
Compressor that occurs whenever you treat an illness

235
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:51,327
You wouldn't say that antibiotics

236
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:54,399
Create antibiotic-resistant strains of illness

237
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:56,703
But if you don't take a full course of antibiotics

238
00:12:57,215 --> 00:12:57,983
You might f*** around and

239
00:12:58,239 --> 00:12:59,007
Create antibiotics

240
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:00,287
Dial resistance

241
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:01,823
How many times do we have to

242
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:08,223
To discuss evolutionary arms races before people are like oh evolutionary arms-race is what's going on right here

243
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:14,111
If you do care to look for this and actually you can find the report

244
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:15,647
If you wanted look

245
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:16,927
The primary sources instead of

246
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:18,207
Of what Alex does is a

247
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:19,743
Skim Daily Mail articles

248
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:21,023
Breezy flight

249
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:23,071
That article are that tie-dye paper if you want

250
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:27,935
It's titled SPI

251
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:28,959
For the next few months

252
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:34,591
The frame of this document is really clear and that it's discussing possible circumstances that you cake

253
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:35,615
You could find itself in

254
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:38,687
But officials need to keep in mind as they embark on quote

255
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:40,479
The final step of Ethan

256
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:44,575
Primarily they list a key concern is being the quote

257
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:45,855
Any epidemic

258
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:50,207
Trajectory that could lead to unsustainable pressure on the NHS or other adverse outcomes

259
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:51,999
Would need to be identified and

260
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:53,791
Contingency enacted within days

261
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:57,375
They're board itself actually of the graphic at the bottom of it.

262
00:13:57,631 --> 00:13:58,143
Explains

263
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:00,191
What they mean when they say realistic

264
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:01,215
Possibility

265
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:03,263
This is something that has about a 42

266
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:05,311
To 50% chance in their estimation

267
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:09,407
It's slightly more probable than unlikely and less likely then

268
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:10,175
Likely

269
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:11,455
All these contacts

270
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:17,343
Is absent from Alex's coverage because he's just interested in both representing headlines in order to scare the audience into whatever

271
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:18,367
Directions

272
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:19,903
Going to be profitable that day

273
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:21,183
Also

274
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:22,463
A 2.6

275
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:24,767
6 billion number that isn't from the report

276
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:26,815
This is just a calculation Alex

277
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:30,143
Or maybe you could even blame the Daily Mail for this week

278
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:30,911
It's just take

279
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:35,775
The death rate that you would have heard about 1/2 the inspection rate

280
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:42,175
It's that we see currently so it's applying it to the entire world population

281
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:44,223
The entire world population

282
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:47,039
Okay

283
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:49,087
Alright

284
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:55,231
All right. If that is a little sloppy you have is a Daily Mail report

285
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:56,255
Kind of

286
00:14:57,023 --> 00:15:03,167
Not great in terms of the underlying primary source even further off course

287
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:05,983
With nonsense we have the British media saying that

288
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:08,799
2.6 billion

289
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:10,847
You know I think the big problem

290
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:16,223
That we're experiencing right now is a simple kind of error which is that in order to

291
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:17,247
To deal with this

292
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:19,039
We needed l

293
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:20,063
Who had the courage

294
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:22,623
To say things that people didn't want to hear

295
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:24,927
And then enforce those things as being necessary

296
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:27,999
System doesn't reward

297
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:29,279
Courageous leaders

298
00:15:29,791 --> 00:15:33,375
It punishes them for sometimes being wrong or being right in a mean way

299
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:35,679
And I so instead we got a bunch

300
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:36,959
Ifucking coward

301
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:39,263
Is a mess

302
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:42,079
One thing I really always appreciate

303
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:43,103
About

304
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:44,127
Someone like an owl

305
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:45,407
Even if he is

306
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:46,431
You know lost tracks

307
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:47,199
Sometimes

308
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:49,503
He really knows how to keep his own stories

309
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:50,271
Straight

310
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:56,671
They have begun that long dad has these things that he's researched

311
00:15:56,927 --> 00:15:57,439
And like

312
00:15:57,695 --> 00:15:58,207
Gino's

313
00:15:58,719 --> 00:16:00,255
Forward and backward

314
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:01,279
Too much yeah

315
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:03,839
Yeah like I got a really good handle on stuff

316
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:15,359
Williamston million views herself

317
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:19,967
Oh my God

318
00:16:23,551 --> 00:16:24,831
Rockefellers another's

319
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:32,767
That would collapse civilization

320
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:38,143
And then the Crimson Contagion

321
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:45,567
128.

322
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:47,615
Document

323
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:49,151
Text Arianna crimson

324
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:52,735
Really sad to hear the way Alex is talking about these two exercises

325
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:56,575
He's made a ton of s*** about both to the point where he doesn't even remember which

326
00:16:57,599 --> 00:17:01,183
The reality of either underlying thing isn't even something that he's connected

327
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:02,719
To any longer which is

328
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:03,487
Outrageous

329
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:08,095
Neither of these things that he's talking about were around by the Rockefeller

330
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:08,863
Dude with cheese

331
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:09,631
Dragonfly

332
00:17:10,143 --> 00:17:12,959
Crimson contagion with a series of exercises went by the HHS

333
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:14,239
It was a government operate

334
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:19,871
Because it was a big elaborate scenario thing there were a bunch of governmental and non-governmental participant

335
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:22,687
Hitler report there's actually a list of non-governmental / 2

336
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:24,223
Just been to the Rockefeller Foundation

337
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:25,759
One of those

338
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:30,623
Bars with a scenario exercise those run by Johns Hopkins Center for Health

339
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:31,391
Security

340
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:35,231
These are two very different exercises in the fact that Alex can get them

341
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:36,767
Confused is a very strong

342
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:39,583
Indication that he doesn't know anything about them past their name

343
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:41,375
And the stories that he's made up about the

344
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:47,519
Crimson contagion was a government-run series of exercises about the fictitious discovery of a novel influenza virus

345
00:17:48,031 --> 00:17:49,055
Not a Coronavirus

346
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:51,359
In Crimson contagion the idea was

347
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:55,967
The test interagency collaboration as well as collaboration with non-governmental agencies

348
00:17:56,223 --> 00:18:00,063
And tribal leaders to see what challenges would arise in the course of responding to a

349
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:00,831
A new infection

350
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:01,599
Disease

351
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:04,927
Airport is largely about the things that they learned in the course of role play

352
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:05,695
Playing like quote

353
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:10,047
Response Partners lack Clarity on cdc's data-sharing policies in

354
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:13,375
Quote confusion regarding the purpose of and Target audio

355
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:17,983
For National Conference Calls a coordination among state and federal response partner

356
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:20,799
This is not like an elaborate scenario that

357
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:22,591
It's washed out with a ton of detail in this

358
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:25,407
Because they point the exercise was to have

359
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:28,223
A basic problem that require coordination to address

360
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:30,271
We could create the opportunity for people to

361
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:31,551
To test that coordination

362
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:33,855
In a safe environment and identify problems

363
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:34,623
Ahead of time

364
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:35,903
Conversely

365
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:38,975
Sparse is a little bit of a different kind of scenario exercise

366
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:42,815
This isn't something that was role-played like rims

367
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:43,583
Contagion

368
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:45,375
He's instead of document

369
00:18:45,631 --> 00:18:46,399
Delays out of fictitious

370
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:47,679
Future series of events

371
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:49,471
Then poses questions about how

372
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:50,239
You could best

373
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:51,775
Respond to those develop

374
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,335
Esparza's exercise that is it

375
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:55,359
Explicitly about Messi

376
00:18:55,615 --> 00:18:56,383
Messaging and Public Health

377
00:18:56,639 --> 00:18:57,663
Risk communication

378
00:18:58,175 --> 00:19:00,991
Doesn't really lend itself to role playing in the way the crimson

379
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:01,759
Contagion

380
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:05,343
Trying to explore challenges of Public Health messaging would be hard to

381
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:08,159
Do in a role-playing environment without a fake audience

382
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:08,927
To send the message

383
00:19:09,183 --> 00:19:09,695
Just to

384
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:10,719
That makes a lot more

385
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:12,255
Sense to broach the issue in this format

386
00:19:12,511 --> 00:19:16,863
Where you have like discussion questions

387
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:23,007
You got this curveball thrown at you like a basketball practice

388
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:25,055
Esparza's like famous

389
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:25,823
Messi football

390
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:32,223
Sure you know what I'm saying like the basketball practice you've got people playing you're running through the scenarios that might come up

391
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:34,527
Open a game the fantasy football years

392
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:37,599
Studying and you're taking Jada and extrapolating based on

393
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:39,647
Or maybe like

394
00:19:41,183 --> 00:19:43,743
Esparza's like you would a chalkboard working-out a play

395
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:45,279
Sure whatever

396
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:51,167
Yeah Yeah Yeahs document is meant to highlight a different communication challenge that officials could face in

397
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:52,191
The context of a panda

398
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:57,823
Chapter 17 is about messaging surrounding potential vaccine side effects but the information

399
00:19:58,079 --> 00:19:58,847
Alex is providing

400
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:00,127
Anyway consist

401
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:02,175
Any of that stuff

402
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:04,479
Yeah it's interesting

403
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:06,783
When you are basing things on reality

404
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,319
That have reference

405
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:09,855
You can refer back

406
00:20:10,111 --> 00:20:10,623
Back to those

407
00:20:10,879 --> 00:20:11,391
If you

408
00:20:12,415 --> 00:20:13,183
Casino

409
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:13,951
If you makeup

410
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:16,255
Details

411
00:20:16,511 --> 00:20:18,559
How about things and then create a completely different

412
00:20:18,815 --> 00:20:20,607
Something based around 2 and then forget what that is

413
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:22,143
Go back and find it

414
00:20:22,911 --> 00:20:25,983
Well you certainly can't find the thing that says the thing you said

415
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:27,007
Exactly

416
00:20:27,263 --> 00:20:30,079
You can still say the name of the thing

417
00:20:30,591 --> 00:20:33,407
Convince people you have Reddit know you're talkin

418
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:39,039
I understand the basic pieces of information that Alex is trying to run with here and it's all bulshit but

419
00:20:39,295 --> 00:20:42,623
I literally drive home here that Alex doesn't even know the fake things he's talking

420
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:43,391
About

421
00:20:43,647 --> 00:20:48,767
He put out an emergency Special Report on Saturday restarted to get into the stuff and here's what he said

422
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:51,839
You know what makes me even more concerned you know I'm really free

423
00:20:52,095 --> 00:20:52,607
Breakout

424
00:20:52,863 --> 00:20:54,143
Sunday show tomorrow

425
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:55,679
For 6 p.m.

426
00:20:56,703 --> 00:20:57,471
Crimson Contagion

427
00:20:58,751 --> 00:20:59,263
4 years ago

428
00:21:01,311 --> 00:21:01,823
3 years ago

429
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:04,639
They saying there

430
00:21:05,407 --> 00:21:07,455
But they're going to roll out of vaccine for a Coronavirus

431
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:08,735
And a year later

432
00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:09,759
Turn out of kills about

433
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:11,551
Ella even

434
00:21:11,807 --> 00:21:14,623
Disable Public Health officials will step down apologizing

435
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:16,672
They're going to have new that what you said

436
00:21:16,928 --> 00:21:17,952
Why would they say that

437
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:18,720
Variance

438
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:20,000
That the mistaken

439
00:21:20,256 --> 00:21:21,024
Failed vaccine

440
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,328
Creates the hugest thing it was crimson

441
00:21:23,584 --> 00:21:27,680
Contagion on Saturday which matches basically zero of the details he's describing

442
00:21:28,192 --> 00:21:29,728
So I would guess you're that I guess

443
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:33,568
He decided he was going to really push Crimson Contagion

444
00:21:33,824 --> 00:21:35,104
Super hard on Saturday

445
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,640
Heaven sometime in between

446
00:21:36,896 --> 00:21:40,224
Queen van and the Sunday show one of his in terms of someone's like

447
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,784
You got the document wrong

448
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,576
That's why you corrected himself

449
00:21:44,832 --> 00:21:45,856
On Sunday show

450
00:21:46,112 --> 00:21:47,392
Tahiry is on Saturday again

451
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:48,928
Still just trying to push it as

452
00:21:49,184 --> 00:21:49,696
Backrooms

453
00:21:49,952 --> 00:21:50,464
Contagion

454
00:21:51,488 --> 00:21:52,000
You read

455
00:21:52,256 --> 00:21:54,560
Crimson contagion if you read of it to A-1

456
00:21:55,072 --> 00:21:56,352
If you read operation lockstep

457
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:57,120
Rockefellers

458
00:21:57,632 --> 00:21:58,400
The Rockefeller Foundation

459
00:21:58,656 --> 00:21:59,936
Now in complete control

460
00:22:00,448 --> 00:22:00,960
World policy

461
00:22:01,472 --> 00:22:02,240
Really

462
00:22:03,008 --> 00:22:03,520
Oh

463
00:22:04,288 --> 00:22:06,592
I didn't know they talked about how it's all going to come out

464
00:22:07,104 --> 00:22:09,664
And how they're going to spend that through fear

465
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:15,296
Couldn't make you want to take even more vaccines they've created a are going to come to you

466
00:22:16,064 --> 00:22:18,368
Who are against all of this who have the new vaccine

467
00:22:18,624 --> 00:22:20,160
It'll protect you from the last vaccine

468
00:22:21,184 --> 00:22:23,488
Now that was in Crimson contagion 34 years ago

469
00:22:25,024 --> 00:22:31,168
I guess he'll date has been partially removed did not know that being in the account

470
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:37,824
12 tubing mid-level management and now he's out of the game completely I'm guessing if I were to ask Alex where he found

471
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:40,896
Papers or something

472
00:22:41,408 --> 00:22:41,920
I would just

473
00:22:42,432 --> 00:22:48,576
Run into a wall that would be a really interesting document to read if it while your reading rate

474
00:22:48,832 --> 00:22:49,344
It's like

475
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:55,744
And then when people read this document will make them afraid of the document itself me like wait a second I'm reading

476
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,304
Nothing you're telling me I'm supposed to be afraid of now

477
00:22:59,328 --> 00:23:00,608
It's a mirror in a mirror

478
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:05,728
I think it's really important to understand how we could grasp Alex has on these basic

479
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:08,288
Details about the primary sources that he's misusing

480
00:23:09,056 --> 00:23:12,896
All these names are interchangeable for him because none of them actually are even real

481
00:23:13,152 --> 00:23:16,992
According to him they aren't real

482
00:23:17,248 --> 00:23:20,576
Over the course of his broadcast is created entirely fictional version

483
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:23,648
Crimson contagion to vent 201 and sparse

484
00:23:23,904 --> 00:23:24,416
Onision

485
00:23:24,672 --> 00:23:26,208
Completely fabricated operation lock

486
00:23:26,464 --> 00:23:27,744
Step out of that Rockefeller

487
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:28,768
Methodist never read

488
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,816
These documents are real

489
00:23:31,072 --> 00:23:32,608
And actually interesting to read

490
00:23:32,864 --> 00:23:34,400
But not for the reasons that Alex and

491
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:35,680
They are fixed

492
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:37,472
It's all fake

493
00:23:37,984 --> 00:23:39,520
Yeah I mean the problem is

494
00:23:39,776 --> 00:23:42,848
Disease created so many b*******

495
00:23:43,104 --> 00:23:46,432
Scenarios out of these two scenarios you know like he's

496
00:23:46,688 --> 00:23:47,456
He's written

497
00:23:47,712 --> 00:23:52,064
An entire universe filled with characters trying to kill you

498
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,112
And all of these things and it's like The Simpsons

499
00:23:54,368 --> 00:23:55,392
But you know

500
00:23:56,160 --> 00:24:02,304
You can't remember any of the episodes so it just kind of picks and chooses whoever shows up and you're like no that's not where

501
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:05,888
That goes man that's not where comic book guy is supposed to be

502
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:09,472
Comic Book Guy is back over there helping Bill Gates murder everybody

503
00:24:10,752 --> 00:24:15,616
Bugatti this episode you know that I should tell you that I'm on the Saturday show

504
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:19,712
He does say that Bill Maher is starting to come around

505
00:24:20,224 --> 00:24:24,320
So he might be working on casting people against type

506
00:24:24,576 --> 00:24:27,904
Now we're back at Belmar

507
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:29,440
Yikes all right

508
00:24:29,696 --> 00:24:31,232
So this is this is where I got worried

509
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:33,280
Sounds like oh man

510
00:24:33,536 --> 00:24:34,048
Alex

511
00:24:34,304 --> 00:24:35,072
You might have prepared

512
00:24:35,584 --> 00:24:37,632
This information I study

513
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:39,936
I like six hours

514
00:24:41,472 --> 00:24:43,520
Almost

515
00:24:43,776 --> 00:24:44,800
Contemplative

516
00:24:48,384 --> 00:24:49,152
Wow

517
00:24:49,408 --> 00:24:52,992
You might have prepared today

518
00:24:55,552 --> 00:24:56,064
I don't know

519
00:24:56,576 --> 00:25:02,720
Oh man I was working on this for six hours and I got dizzy when I got busy what I said that was so intense

520
00:25:02,976 --> 00:25:04,768
I got dizzy from the information

521
00:25:05,792 --> 00:25:07,072
I don't know I don't know how

522
00:25:07,584 --> 00:25:11,680
How much harder he could try to convince people that

523
00:25:17,312 --> 00:25:17,824
For the past

524
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:22,176
48 hours in the last time that I stood up I lost one of my

525
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:26,272
I grabbed it and I put it back on

526
00:25:26,784 --> 00:25:28,320
It's all because I've been reading

527
00:25:29,088 --> 00:25:35,232
Globalist planned Crimson Contagion

528
00:25:35,488 --> 00:25:36,512
And I would get into it but I

529
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:38,560
I've got dizzy the last time I learned about

530
00:25:38,816 --> 00:25:41,120
So I can't talk

531
00:25:41,376 --> 00:25:46,752
So he get Alex gets into a little bit of cigar called a little bit fear-monger

532
00:25:47,776 --> 00:25:48,544
As he comes back

533
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:49,312
Break

534
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:56,736
Dependent enhancement

535
00:25:56,992 --> 00:26:02,368
Real real well when your friends your family and you bleed out

536
00:26:02,624 --> 00:26:03,648
By the near future

537
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:04,928
Who

538
00:26:05,696 --> 00:26:10,048
Okay so everybody dependent enhancement is a real phenomenon that scientists

539
00:26:10,304 --> 00:26:11,072
Do see it.

540
00:26:11,584 --> 00:26:13,632
But it's actually really funny that Alex is trying to connect

541
00:26:13,888 --> 00:26:15,424
Possibility to covid vaccine

542
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,448
Number of reason

543
00:26:17,216 --> 00:26:20,288
The biggest of them is that the possibility of adee with

544
00:26:20,544 --> 00:26:22,336
Absolutely something the researchers and

545
00:26:22,592 --> 00:26:25,408
Experts were discussing in the early stages of developing a vaccine

546
00:26:25,664 --> 00:26:31,808
Oh yeah if there is an active pandemic giving people something that will make them respond worse to contact with virus

547
00:26:32,064 --> 00:26:32,832
Chris's is going

548
00:26:33,088 --> 00:26:33,600
To be ultimately

549
00:26:33,856 --> 00:26:34,368
Lee

550
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,672
And probably one of things going to check off

551
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:37,696
Early

552
00:26:37,952 --> 00:26:43,840
The best way to understand Abe is by talking about the first place it was identified which is in relation to

553
00:26:44,096 --> 00:26:44,864
The dengue fever

554
00:26:45,632 --> 00:26:48,960
Therefore varieties are serotypes of dengue fever numbered 1

555
00:26:49,216 --> 00:26:49,728
Through 4

556
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,544
If you get sick with Dengue Fever type 1

557
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:53,568
Anemone survive

558
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:56,128
Your body will create antibodies that protect

559
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:57,152
From fat zero

560
00:26:57,664 --> 00:26:58,688
Should you ever encounter at

561
00:26:58,944 --> 00:26:59,456
In the future

562
00:26:59,968 --> 00:27:00,480
That's great news

563
00:27:00,992 --> 00:27:01,504
However

564
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,552
The problem is that if you run into stereotype

565
00:27:03,808 --> 00:27:04,832
Two three or four

566
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:08,416
Decent chance of the antibodies you have against Arrow type 1

567
00:27:09,184 --> 00:27:11,744
Actually enhance the ability of dengue fever to replicate

568
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:18,144
Innovative be neutralized inside your body infection is actually really it's worth

569
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,168
Yeah yeah

570
00:27:20,192 --> 00:27:23,520
The concept is a bit more complicated than that but that's the basic idea of what the

571
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:24,800
Concerns are about ADA

572
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:27,616
Impact studies there has been

573
00:27:27,872 --> 00:27:32,224
Indications that SARS and MERS were two diseases whose treatment involves concern

574
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:33,504
It's about a DE

575
00:27:34,016 --> 00:27:36,064
Since this new virus sars-cov 2

576
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:37,856
Is closely related to those two

577
00:27:38,112 --> 00:27:40,928
That was an obvious question the people were discussing

578
00:27:41,184 --> 00:27:42,976
You can find tons of papers on the subject

579
00:27:43,232 --> 00:27:45,280
From early in the time of when vaccines are starting to

580
00:27:45,536 --> 00:27:46,304
Come around

581
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:47,328
Because

582
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:48,608
The way he says

583
00:27:48,864 --> 00:27:49,376
Is it to is like

584
00:27:49,632 --> 00:27:53,728
Antibody that's a term you're going to get to know real well is your family's bleed now and

585
00:27:53,984 --> 00:27:55,264
When is like no

586
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,032
I won't

587
00:27:56,800 --> 00:28:02,944
Because they already learned it real well that's the point you're the only person hearing about it for the first time

588
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,736
Blowin Minds baby

589
00:28:04,992 --> 00:28:06,272
Some early indications raised

590
00:28:06,528 --> 00:28:08,576
Concerns that having vaccines that attack viral protein

591
00:28:08,832 --> 00:28:09,856
Themes of covid epicenter

592
00:28:10,112 --> 00:28:11,136
The cause adee

593
00:28:11,392 --> 00:28:14,464
Which is one of the reasons that research skewed very heavily in the direct

594
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:16,000
MRNA vaccine

595
00:28:16,256 --> 00:28:17,792
The targeting of Spike protein

596
00:28:18,048 --> 00:28:19,328
Instead of the viral

597
00:28:19,584 --> 00:28:20,352
Alright

598
00:28:21,376 --> 00:28:24,192
I was just pretending this some kind of a big issue that everyone's ignoring

599
00:28:24,704 --> 00:28:26,496
It's not the scientific Community is kept

600
00:28:26,752 --> 00:28:28,032
The phenomenon willing mind and

601
00:28:28,288 --> 00:28:30,336
Pandemic response is going on

602
00:28:30,592 --> 00:28:33,408
And follow-up research on people who have been vaccinated that bro

603
00:28:33,664 --> 00:28:34,944
Breakthrough infections actually shown

604
00:28:35,456 --> 00:28:37,504
There really aren't signs of adee with covid

605
00:28:38,272 --> 00:28:44,416
If there were 80 happening you would expect to see vaccinated people having more severe cases of covid-19 exposed

606
00:28:44,672 --> 00:28:45,952
The virus but in reality

607
00:28:46,208 --> 00:28:47,488
The cases among vaccinated people

608
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:48,768
Physically less severe

609
00:28:49,024 --> 00:28:50,560
I have lied to last hospitalization

610
00:28:51,584 --> 00:28:54,400
Which are very strong indications that lady is not selling

611
00:28:55,936 --> 00:28:56,448
Just the fact that

612
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,752
The vaccine has documented

613
00:29:00,288 --> 00:29:00,800
Effectiveness

614
00:29:01,056 --> 00:29:01,568
Against

615
00:29:01,824 --> 00:29:02,592
New variant

616
00:29:02,848 --> 00:29:03,360
As well with

617
00:29:03,872 --> 00:29:06,432
Just very obviously that it's not that huge

618
00:29:06,944 --> 00:29:08,736
If it were then we would see

619
00:29:10,016 --> 00:29:14,368
Increased or even greater negative reaction from the Delta variant if you were

620
00:29:14,624 --> 00:29:15,648
Vaccinated again

621
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:16,672
Whatever you know

622
00:29:17,952 --> 00:29:20,768
I was listening to this and I thought that it was pretty clear that

623
00:29:21,024 --> 00:29:22,048
This is basically going to

624
00:29:22,304 --> 00:29:23,072
To be how Alex

625
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:26,912
Explains away future deaths

626
00:29:27,168 --> 00:29:28,704
People who are vaccinated who

627
00:29:32,032 --> 00:29:34,336
Issues where they got the vaccine and then

628
00:29:34,592 --> 00:29:35,360
They got they got

629
00:29:35,616 --> 00:29:36,384
The challenge of

630
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:39,968
Being exposed to covanta near a global scale.

631
00:29:41,248 --> 00:29:41,760
Whatever

632
00:29:42,272 --> 00:29:43,808
So you're some big news

633
00:29:47,136 --> 00:29:47,904
You don't think it's big news

634
00:29:48,928 --> 00:29:49,440
Alright

635
00:29:49,696 --> 00:29:54,816
This is a live Sunday August 1st 2021 transmission

636
00:29:56,352 --> 00:29:58,656
What year was the big announcement

637
00:29:59,936 --> 00:30:00,704
It is not debate

638
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:07,104
By the NIH

639
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:08,384
Bob again

640
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,152
IAH

641
00:30:14,272 --> 00:30:17,088
National Health Service or any other world

642
00:30:19,136 --> 00:30:19,648
Call covid

643
00:30:19,904 --> 00:30:21,952
19 of a sedation for the baby

644
00:30:27,584 --> 00:30:29,120
Johnson & Johnson

645
00:30:34,752 --> 00:30:35,520
All of them

646
00:30:35,776 --> 00:30:36,544
Make you get

647
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:37,312
Covid

648
00:30:39,104 --> 00:30:41,152
Create

649
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:48,064
What's good to know that Alex has learned that AstraZeneca isn't an mRNA vaccine by this point

650
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:48,832
Work

651
00:30:49,088 --> 00:30:51,648
Although I will say my Counterpoint all this is

652
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:56,000
All of that would absolutely be debated by any of the groups that I like

653
00:30:56,256 --> 00:30:56,768
Waitlisted

654
00:30:57,024 --> 00:30:58,048
This complete b*******

655
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:02,400
Yeah that's an insane thing to say about the claim that Alex is making this weekend

656
00:31:02,656 --> 00:31:03,424
Parsnip

657
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:04,448
It's really stupid

658
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:08,032
He's saying that all these different covid vaccines one

659
00:31:08,544 --> 00:31:09,056
Make you get

660
00:31:09,312 --> 00:31:09,824
Get covid

661
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,616
To make you shed Cove

662
00:31:12,128 --> 00:31:12,640
Free

663
00:31:12,896 --> 00:31:14,432
Make you create deadly variants

664
00:31:14,944 --> 00:31:15,456
And for

665
00:31:15,968 --> 00:31:16,480
Don't work

666
00:31:17,248 --> 00:31:18,272
None of this is true

667
00:31:18,784 --> 00:31:19,552
How could

668
00:31:19,808 --> 00:31:21,088
For be true

669
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,136
If 133 or

670
00:31:23,904 --> 00:31:27,488
I get well that's one of my problems with actually the fourth point is like I don't know what

671
00:31:27,744 --> 00:31:28,256
Not working

672
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:32,352
Yeah I mean if it's too nonspecific for me to take seriously so I'm not even going to

673
00:31:32,608 --> 00:31:38,752
Not just that but I mean if it's the point of it is to get give people covered shed covid and then create deadly

674
00:31:39,008 --> 00:31:40,544
Very it's any very clearly is working

675
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,336
Wow that's why I don't

676
00:31:42,592 --> 00:31:46,176
Engage version of vying to be different

677
00:31:46,432 --> 00:31:47,968
Is it very clearly

678
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:54,624
With .3 the vaccines make people create deadly various of the virus that just doesn't stand up

679
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:55,392
Neither

680
00:31:55,648 --> 00:31:58,464
Came into existence

681
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:00,256
Before the vaccines were developed in in Venice

682
00:32:00,512 --> 00:32:01,024
Mustard so

683
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:01,792
I guess unless

684
00:32:02,048 --> 00:32:04,352
There's some other mystery variants that he's talking

685
00:32:04,608 --> 00:32:05,120
Sing about him

686
00:32:05,632 --> 00:32:06,400
Take us seriously either

687
00:32:06,656 --> 00:32:08,960
Get the f*** out one just isn't Drew thanks

688
00:32:09,216 --> 00:32:12,288
Don't make you get covid-19

689
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:15,104
Who does leaves a point to about shedding virus

690
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:17,152
Which is the only part that even comes close to

691
00:32:18,688 --> 00:32:21,248
Some recent preprint studies of symptom indications

692
00:32:21,504 --> 00:32:23,808
It's possible for people who have been vaccinated but end up

693
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:25,856
Sing a breakthrough case of the Delta variant

694
00:32:26,112 --> 00:32:29,184
They could be as infectious as unvaccinated person

695
00:32:30,208 --> 00:32:32,000
This is a matter that we are definitely

696
00:32:32,256 --> 00:32:34,560
We need more data on before we can jump to any solid

697
00:32:34,816 --> 00:32:37,632
Conclusions but it's something that makes it clear that we should all be

698
00:32:37,888 --> 00:32:38,656
Cautious

699
00:32:38,912 --> 00:32:39,936
These same studies

700
00:32:40,192 --> 00:32:45,056
Is it suggested possibility also found quote viral load decrease Pastor the vaccinated group so

701
00:32:45,312 --> 00:32:46,336
Either way there appears to be

702
00:32:46,592 --> 00:32:48,640
Be concrete Public Health advantages to being vaccinated

703
00:32:48,896 --> 00:32:50,688
Even if it isn't a magic Silver Bullet

704
00:32:50,944 --> 00:32:54,784
And even if we're learning along the way new things that we were not aware I was earlier

705
00:32:55,552 --> 00:32:57,344
There's serious concerns that married discussion

706
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,392
What about potential challenges we're still facing with

707
00:32:59,648 --> 00:33:00,416
The Coronavirus

708
00:33:00,672 --> 00:33:02,464
Alex is acting does he

709
00:33:02,976 --> 00:33:05,280
Lead the service towards anyone's abilities engaged

710
00:33:05,536 --> 00:33:06,048
This material

711
00:33:06,304 --> 00:33:07,072
In a serious way

712
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:08,608
If you get information

713
00:33:08,864 --> 00:33:12,448
Confirm him you have to sift through all this b******* in order to reach one thing

714
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:13,728
It's being discussed

715
00:33:13,984 --> 00:33:14,496
Poorly

716
00:33:14,752 --> 00:33:17,568
Which is the idea that if you're vaccinated you still might be contagious

717
00:33:17,824 --> 00:33:20,896
Get the information that you need for better places without having to

718
00:33:21,152 --> 00:33:24,224
Huh big through a pile mean

719
00:33:24,992 --> 00:33:30,368
I can't imagine like an emergency broadcast alert suddenly breaking in while you're while you're watching

720
00:33:30,624 --> 00:33:31,136
Sing some

721
00:33:31,392 --> 00:33:32,928
Dumb reality shows like Survivor

722
00:33:33,696 --> 00:33:34,464
And then the government like

723
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:37,024
You're going to die

724
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:40,096
Anyways just so you know that the possibility that breakthrough

725
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:40,864
Actions could be a problem

726
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,912
You're going to die you're going to die you're going to die

727
00:33:44,192 --> 00:33:47,520
But that's what Alex is doing and I don't know how useful that is

728
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:50,592
The emergency broadcast system

729
00:33:50,848 --> 00:33:51,872
F****** Moody as hell

730
00:33:52,128 --> 00:33:53,664
Bad bad days

731
00:33:56,224 --> 00:34:00,832
Happy care if you guys make it through this emergency

732
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:06,720
Hey maybe it's not an emergency maybe I'm talking with you who knows

733
00:34:06,976 --> 00:34:12,352
Maybe I should join the tornado the FDR's Fireside Chats of just a moody ask

734
00:34:13,376 --> 00:34:19,520
Alright so we're fighting this f****** why don't even know does anybody even hate the Nazis anymore I don't know

735
00:34:23,104 --> 00:34:26,176
Depression is great

736
00:34:26,432 --> 00:34:27,968
About that maybe it's a great

737
00:34:28,224 --> 00:34:32,064
Depression ratings on my Fireside Chats are down

738
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,088
And I am

739
00:34:33,344 --> 00:34:36,416
I'm pissed about it yeah that would be great

740
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:40,000
Courageous leaders I would love

741
00:34:40,256 --> 00:34:41,536
The re-imaginings of

742
00:34:42,816 --> 00:34:46,144
Like historical figures with the temperament of a moody Alex Jones

743
00:34:47,424 --> 00:34:51,264
We would have never gotten anything done

744
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:53,056
So there's some side effects

745
00:34:53,312 --> 00:34:54,080
And what have you

746
00:34:54,336 --> 00:34:55,104
For vaccines

747
00:34:55,872 --> 00:34:57,408
I do believe that Alex might

748
00:34:57,664 --> 00:34:58,176
Be

749
00:34:58,688 --> 00:34:59,200
Exaggerating

750
00:35:04,576 --> 00:35:06,368
Conditioner blood clot the brain

751
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,048
You don't have a virus

752
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:16,096
You get given protein

753
00:35:16,352 --> 00:35:16,864
What

754
00:35:18,144 --> 00:35:18,912
Myprotein

755
00:35:19,168 --> 00:35:20,448
Your body starts

756
00:35:20,704 --> 00:35:21,216
Rolling

757
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:28,128
Animals of vast majority

758
00:35:28,896 --> 00:35:35,040
Reroute self-addressed

759
00:35:36,064 --> 00:35:37,088
You're going to burn to death

760

Barbie

761
00:35:46,816 --> 00:35:48,352
That's why I'm so shocked

762
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:51,424
This is one hundred percent known

763
00:35:53,728 --> 00:35:55,520
Feisty

764
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:59,616
Play my hand out of the table today

765
00:36:02,176 --> 00:36:03,200
Alex seems

766
00:36:03,456 --> 00:36:04,224
Like in

767
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:07,552
Intrigued by the idea of cause and effect

768
00:36:07,808 --> 00:36:10,112
Kind of concerning me that this is

769
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:16,512
Blowing people's minds in his in his eyes he's like I need to illustrate cause and effect causal relationship

770
00:36:17,024 --> 00:36:19,584
4 *

771
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:22,656
So you know what actually let's start with n

772
00:36:24,192 --> 00:36:24,704
The universe

773
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:27,008
This is four-dimensional space and we are leaving

774
00:36:27,264 --> 00:36:31,616
Spirit Style baby if you drop something and it falls to the ground

775
00:36:33,664 --> 00:36:37,504
John mulaney's Ice Cube

776
00:36:38,016 --> 00:36:39,296
This is Ice-T

777
00:36:39,552 --> 00:36:40,576
This is a little bit

778
00:36:40,832 --> 00:36:41,344
Much

779
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:42,880
I mean first of all just took

780
00:36:43,136 --> 00:36:44,928
From a presentation standpoint I find it

781
00:36:45,184 --> 00:36:45,952
Hilarious butt

782
00:36:47,488 --> 00:36:50,816
Hundreds of millions of vaccines administered in the United States

783
00:36:51,328 --> 00:36:53,888
The majority are absolutely not experienced heart attack

784
00:36:54,144 --> 00:36:55,168
Strokes concert

785
00:36:55,424 --> 00:36:56,960
Nonsense

786
00:36:57,472 --> 00:37:00,800
Them also Alex is trying to make this point he does this clipping

787
00:37:01,056 --> 00:37:04,640
Fully captured but there's this idea that they'd skip the animal trials

788
00:37:04,896 --> 00:37:07,456
But he pushes fairly regularly at night

789
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:13,344
Prodigious were allowed to overlap animal trials with Phase 1 trials because of the nature of the public health

790
00:37:14,112 --> 00:37:15,904
The pass animal trials with no problem

791
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:18,208
Largely ignored

792
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:20,256
We were more excited about the

793
00:37:20,512 --> 00:37:23,328
Human part of it the one we were looking for

794
00:37:23,584 --> 00:37:24,096
Boots

795
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:25,888
Paled in comparison

796
00:37:26,144 --> 00:37:27,680
Open to the idea that

797
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:33,312
Even further progress is being made no I remember reading tons of stories that were like

798
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:41,504
Stokes good vaccine resulted in tested animals and I was like that's awesome

799
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:46,112
If the something had gone wrong with like the animal trials

800
00:37:46,368 --> 00:37:48,928
As Phase 1 trials were overlapping with them

801
00:37:49,696 --> 00:37:50,720
Then back to the drawing board

802
00:37:50,976 --> 00:37:53,024
Imagine if something had gone wrong

803
00:37:53,536 --> 00:37:54,560
And deal

804
00:37:54,816 --> 00:37:56,608
Do you really think I would have expected it

805
00:37:56,864 --> 00:37:59,168
Eye exam surprise

806
00:37:59,424 --> 00:38:02,240
Many people it would have been an emotional blow certainly

807
00:38:02,496 --> 00:38:03,776
But I think Abby will be like yeah

808
00:38:04,032 --> 00:38:10,176
Yeah you try and it sometimes it works

809
00:38:10,432 --> 00:38:16,576
Those would have been very loud they would have been everywhere and Alex would have run with

810
00:38:16,832 --> 00:38:18,624
Them forever

811
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:20,416
So the fact that he didn't

812
00:38:20,928 --> 00:38:25,024
Fruits that didn't happen because he didn't do it when it would have

813
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:26,816
So Alex is a study

814
00:38:29,888 --> 00:38:30,656
Spell doesn't

815
00:38:30,912 --> 00:38:32,192
I really

816
00:38:32,704 --> 00:38:33,728
This is business roster

817
00:38:35,264 --> 00:38:39,104
I got the actual CDC

818
00:38:39,616 --> 00:38:40,640
Show you the actual study

819
00:38:40,896 --> 00:38:47,040
Overhead shot Place why you can't trust

820
00:38:47,296 --> 00:38:49,856
Flies from STP

821
00:38:52,416 --> 00:38:52,928
Percent

822
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:54,208
Helping individuals

823
00:38:59,072 --> 00:39:01,120
Azan in all the different sloughing off

824
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:05,472
Woodley

825
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:07,008
Say that part

826
00:39:07,776 --> 00:39:13,920
They're not really accurate surrounding a cluster of cases that occurred in the wake

827
00:39:14,176 --> 00:39:16,480
Quote multiple summer events and large

828
00:39:16,736 --> 00:39:19,552
Public gatherings in a Town of Barnstable County

829
00:39:19,808 --> 00:39:20,320
Chusetts

830
00:39:20,832 --> 00:39:24,672
They're important questions to ask about this cluster and I would not begrudge anyone raising

831
00:39:24,928 --> 00:39:26,720
I'm concerned about what this sort of thing could it

832
00:39:26,976 --> 00:39:27,488
Imply

833
00:39:27,744 --> 00:39:29,024
But that is not what Alex is doing

834
00:39:29,536 --> 00:39:30,304
He's misreporting

835
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:31,328
And making leaps

836
00:39:31,584 --> 00:39:33,376
Is coverage that are unearned

837
00:39:34,144 --> 00:39:37,984
Princeton's the way you covering this story you'll be led to believe that this has to do with

838
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:41,824
74% of all Delta variant cases being among vaccinated persons

839
00:39:42,336 --> 00:39:42,848
That's how he's

840
00:39:43,104 --> 00:39:43,616
Speaking

841
00:39:43,872 --> 00:39:50,016
What do you think the CDC has a report that 74% of Delta cases early

842
00:39:50,272 --> 00:39:54,368
Liar so you know they're telling the truth what last time they are

843
00:39:55,392 --> 00:39:59,488
The appropriate contact

844
00:39:59,744 --> 00:40:00,512
This was just about

845
00:40:00,768 --> 00:40:04,096
469 people who tested positive after attending events in

846
00:40:04,352 --> 00:40:04,864
In Provincetown

847
00:40:05,632 --> 00:40:07,936
The 74% number is definitely worth looking

848
00:40:08,192 --> 00:40:09,728
It is a concern but

849
00:40:09,984 --> 00:40:10,496
This study does

850
00:40:10,752 --> 00:40:12,544
Does not involve a representative sample

851
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,592
You could extrapolate to the rest of the world

852
00:40:15,104 --> 00:40:17,664
There's far more information we need to track down for the number

853
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:18,432
Could be understood and

854
00:40:18,688 --> 00:40:19,968
It's really full proper Conte

855
00:40:21,248 --> 00:40:26,112
If you read the actual CDC report you'll find a very important note that it's key to remember

856
00:40:26,624 --> 00:40:27,136
Quote

857
00:40:27,392 --> 00:40:33,536
Data from this report are insufficient to draw conclusions about the effectiveness of covid-19 vaccine against Stars Cove 2

858
00:40:33,792 --> 00:40:35,584
Including the Delta variant during this out

859
00:40:36,352 --> 00:40:37,888
As population-level vaccinations

860
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:38,912
Can coverage increases

861
00:40:39,168 --> 00:40:41,472
Vaccinated persons are likely to represent a larger

862
00:40:41,728 --> 00:40:42,240
Proportion

863
00:40:42,496 --> 00:40:43,264
Of covid-19

864
00:40:43,776 --> 00:40:44,288
Team queso

865
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:47,104
This is to say that if in this series of events

866
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:50,688
In Provincetown there was a 95% vaccination rate

867
00:40:50,944 --> 00:40:51,968
You would expect a total number of

868
00:40:52,224 --> 00:40:54,016
Infections UT on outbreak to be

869
00:40:54,272 --> 00:40:55,296
Wow the total no

870
00:40:55,808 --> 00:40:58,112
But the proportion of those infected or vaccinated

871
00:40:58,368 --> 00:40:58,880
Would be higher

872
00:40:59,392 --> 00:41:00,928
This is because no vaccine is a perfect

873
00:41:01,184 --> 00:41:01,952
Effectiveness rating

874
00:41:02,464 --> 00:41:03,232
And also that's just ask

875
00:41:04,768 --> 00:41:06,560
Provincetown is a place in Massachusetts

876
00:41:06,816 --> 00:41:10,144
That's well-known as a very lgbtq-friendly environment

877
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,192
And if I had to bet I would say that it

878
00:41:12,448 --> 00:41:12,960
This place Utah

879
00:41:13,216 --> 00:41:14,752
Pretty high vaccination rate

880
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:19,104
So if you know any event of an outbreak happening in a place like that it doesn't

881
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:20,128
Surprise me too much

882
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:22,944
Percentage of people who are vaccinated would be

883
00:41:23,456 --> 00:41:24,224
That's what you would expect

884
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:30,624
Yeah I've read that I've read too many takes on that and very few people are applying the

885
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:31,904
Very rigorous

886
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:36,256
Context that needs to be applied before you can even engage with that information without terrified

887
00:41:37,024 --> 00:41:38,048
It's still something that you should

888
00:41:38,304 --> 00:41:41,120
Absolutely nothing

889
00:41:41,376 --> 00:41:42,144
He's very

890
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:46,240
And if you understand it within the full context of what it is then isn't

891
00:41:46,496 --> 00:41:50,080
Very interesting and something that needs to be looked at in studies

892
00:41:50,592 --> 00:41:53,663
If you are just reading a wapo headline that you're f******

893
00:41:53,919 --> 00:42:00,063
Terrified there's another there's another important thing and that is needed to take 800 number

894
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:00,831
340

895
00:42:01,087 --> 00:42:03,903
B6 vaccinated persons having breakthrough cases in this outbreak

896
00:42:04,415 --> 00:42:07,487
Only focus on that number you're missing an important figure

897
00:42:07,743 --> 00:42:09,535
Which is how many vaccinated person

898
00:42:09,791 --> 00:42:11,839
Might have been exposed to the virus and didn't

899
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:13,631
In the course of these

900
00:42:13,887 --> 00:42:15,423
Public Gatherings and large events

901
00:42:15,935 --> 00:42:17,983
I'm not saying that any of this makes the story like

902
00:42:18,239 --> 00:42:19,007
Less a matter for

903
00:42:19,263 --> 00:42:19,775
Concerned

904
00:42:20,031 --> 00:42:21,311
Some people should be focusing on

905
00:42:21,567 --> 00:42:24,127
What's just critical of these times take the stuff in the proper

906
00:42:24,895 --> 00:42:26,431
Extrapolate this out to

907
00:42:26,687 --> 00:42:28,735
Do 74% of cases or vaccinate

908
00:42:28,991 --> 00:42:32,575
Yeah yeah I'm concerned quite frankly about unknown unknown

909
00:42:32,831 --> 00:42:33,599
Obviously

910
00:42:33,855 --> 00:42:34,879
How can you not be

911
00:42:35,135 --> 00:42:39,231
I barely left my house this past week is Lollapalooza what's happening at this videos

912
00:42:39,743 --> 00:42:43,327
Amass yeah I was stoked to be in the woods while all opposed

913
00:42:43,583 --> 00:42:47,935
Yeah it's rational be concerned but it's irresponsible to behave the way Alex's

914
00:42:48,191 --> 00:42:50,495
Doing it disseminate information that way

915
00:42:50,751 --> 00:42:53,311
Yeah it's just it only can lead people to make dumb

916
00:42:54,335 --> 00:42:55,359
Informed decision

917
00:42:56,639 --> 00:42:57,151
So what

918
00:42:57,407 --> 00:42:58,431
How do you say something like that

919
00:42:59,711 --> 00:43:01,247
I mean to emphasize

920
00:43:02,271 --> 00:43:04,063
I can't do I can't emphasize

921
00:43:04,575 --> 00:43:05,343
Any more than

922
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:06,879
Alex G himself

923
00:43:07,903 --> 00:43:08,927
Examples of cause and effect

924
00:43:09,183 --> 00:43:09,695
Text to emphasize

925
00:43:09,951 --> 00:43:10,975
He already did that

926
00:43:19,167 --> 00:43:20,447
Call Hatchett

927
00:43:20,703 --> 00:43:26,847
Still working on object permanence because Alex doesn't have that one doubt myself in a mirror the other day

928
00:43:30,431 --> 00:43:31,199
Alex says

929
00:43:31,711 --> 00:43:34,015
Do you get secrets on to another story that is about

930
00:43:34,271 --> 00:43:34,783
A similar theme

931
00:43:35,039 --> 00:43:37,599
That is like vaccinated people are getting

932
00:43:40,671 --> 00:43:42,463
The wet what he uses as a source

933
00:43:43,231 --> 00:43:43,743
Unbelievable

934
00:43:51,423 --> 00:43:54,751
Bossman

935
00:43:55,519 --> 00:43:56,031
Finland

936
00:43:56,799 --> 00:43:57,567
Hospital

937
00:44:03,455 --> 00:44:04,479
JCW's

938
00:44:07,551 --> 00:44:09,599
2/3

939
00:44:11,391 --> 00:44:13,695
70 + 67%

940
00:44:13,951 --> 00:44:16,255
Partially or fully vaccinated with mRNA

941
00:44:21,375 --> 00:44:26,239
I beg anyone who takes Alex Jones seriously to consider how sloppy and lazy this process is

942
00:44:26,751 --> 00:44:31,615
Instead of actually looking into any primary sources on Finland or any possible outbreaks that have happened there

943
00:44:31,871 --> 00:44:32,895
What you just heard

944
00:44:33,151 --> 00:44:34,431
Is how Alex has decided

945
00:44:35,199 --> 00:44:35,711
Story

946
00:44:36,223 --> 00:44:38,015
This is Alex reading a tweet

947
00:44:38,271 --> 00:44:43,391
Permanent verified account that's allegedly run by a guy wiederhold MD and Ms degrees

948
00:44:43,647 --> 00:44:45,951
Where is claiming townhouses in Maryland in Mississippi

949
00:44:46,719 --> 00:44:47,999
This is not how someone who take

950
00:44:48,255 --> 00:44:50,047
Take their job seriously would operate

951
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:55,423
Alex is legitimately just reading the body of this guy's tweet

952
00:44:55,679 --> 00:44:57,727
Accompanied by a screenshot and a link

953
00:44:57,983 --> 00:44:58,495
2

954
00:44:58,751 --> 00:45:02,335
I-80 surveillance article

955
00:45:03,615 --> 00:45:05,663
This is not mean that picking or being an a******

956
00:45:05,919 --> 00:45:07,967
Like Alex is not reporting on the study

957
00:45:08,223 --> 00:45:09,759
He's reporting on a tweet

958
00:45:10,271 --> 00:45:11,807
He's not read the study he has

959
00:45:12,063 --> 00:45:12,831
No idea

960
00:45:13,087 --> 00:45:15,391
The words he's reading what they even mean is what agency

961
00:45:15,647 --> 00:45:16,159
Bwam

962
00:45:17,183 --> 00:45:18,207
It's it's that great

963
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:22,815
It's at Great level of right-wing nonsense where you can just take a random dude with

964
00:45:23,071 --> 00:45:25,887
20 followers tweeting there were three million illegals voting in

965
00:45:26,143 --> 00:45:29,471
And turn it into the number one narrative that people throw around a fuk

966
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:30,239
Talking election

967
00:45:30,751 --> 00:45:35,615
Play it's it's a mess and it's such a shity work that I don't even know why I found the study and read

968
00:45:35,871 --> 00:45:36,895
But suffice it to say

969
00:45:37,407 --> 00:45:41,503
It's another very small snapshot of an outbreak that happened at a secondary care hospital

970
00:45:41,759 --> 00:45:43,295
When Finland in May of this year

971
00:45:44,063 --> 00:45:46,111
45 healthcare workers in 58-page

972
00:45:46,367 --> 00:45:48,415
Ended up attracting covid if you look at the data

973
00:45:48,671 --> 00:45:49,951
What are things that jumps out

974
00:45:50,207 --> 00:45:50,975
Is possibly most

975
00:45:51,231 --> 00:45:53,023
Concerning is the people who were only

976
00:45:53,279 --> 00:45:55,583
Partially vaccinated might have a higher risk

977
00:45:56,095 --> 00:45:56,607
With Delta very

978
00:45:57,375 --> 00:46:01,727
48 out of the 103 cases were among people who were only partially vaccinated

979
00:46:02,239 --> 00:46:05,567
As compared with 35 for unvaccinated and 20 who are fully vac

980
00:46:05,823 --> 00:46:09,919
Dynamics between the lake healthcare workers

981
00:46:11,711 --> 00:46:15,295
Drastic age discrepancy variables

982
00:46:16,063 --> 00:46:17,599
Keep an eye on butt

983
00:46:17,855 --> 00:46:18,623
This is not the

984
00:46:18,879 --> 00:46:20,927
Just a case study that you can read a tweet about

985
00:46:21,183 --> 00:46:23,999
Assume that it applies to the entire like General

986
00:46:24,255 --> 00:46:26,047
Populaire r0k studies

987
00:46:26,303 --> 00:46:32,447
You can read a tweet about and then just extrapolate from me for this must be proved up all the way

988
00:46:33,727 --> 00:46:36,287
Just take this belief added word

989
00:46:36,799 --> 00:46:37,567
So

990
00:46:37,823 --> 00:46:38,591
Alex gets back

991
00:46:38,847 --> 00:46:39,871
Activities in Vista

992
00:46:40,383 --> 00:46:41,407
This British article

993
00:46:41,919 --> 00:46:42,431
I think

994
00:46:42,687 --> 00:46:44,735
Thinks he hasn't actually talked about even though you open the

995
00:46:44,991 --> 00:46:46,271
The show talking about

996
00:46:46,783 --> 00:46:47,295
We got

997
00:46:47,551 --> 00:46:49,087
Really

998
00:46:49,343 --> 00:46:50,623
Big news the British

999
00:46:50,879 --> 00:46:52,415
Official government agency

1000
00:46:57,279 --> 00:47:00,863
Come out ladies and gentlemen instead mutants from the vaccinated

1001
00:47:04,959 --> 00:47:06,239
What's billion people

1002
00:47:07,775 --> 00:47:09,055
Call wards.com

1003
00:47:09,311 --> 00:47:12,127
It's also equally likely that it will mutate into something it is harmless

1004
00:47:13,151 --> 00:47:13,663
Weather.

1005
00:47:14,175 --> 00:47:15,711
Sometimes you know

1006
00:47:15,967 --> 00:47:19,039
Part of this is going to blow everybody's

1007
00:47:19,295 --> 00:47:21,599
Everybody's Minds about here that you know like that

1008
00:47:22,111 --> 00:47:22,879
You know when you evolve

1009
00:47:23,391 --> 00:47:25,183
Like to survive and do like propagating

1010
00:47:25,439 --> 00:47:27,999
Discontinued and sometimes one way to evolve is to not

1011
00:47:28,255 --> 00:47:29,791
Kill your host and then just

1012
00:47:30,047 --> 00:47:30,559
Keep going

1013
00:47:31,071 --> 00:47:32,607
You know another way to evolve

1014
00:47:34,911 --> 00:47:35,935
So

1015
00:47:37,471 --> 00:47:38,239
When's the last time

1016
00:47:38,751 --> 00:47:39,775
You remember

1017
00:47:40,031 --> 00:47:41,823
Alex thank you figured it all out

1018
00:47:49,247 --> 00:47:51,807
I mean baby in my dreams it was last night

1019
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:54,111
It happens a lot

1020
00:47:54,367 --> 00:47:55,391
Every

1021
00:47:56,671 --> 00:47:57,439
I like at least

1022
00:47:58,207 --> 00:48:03,839
Three four times a month I'm coming to studio and say that he's finally figured it all out

1023
00:48:04,095 --> 00:48:06,911
It took me a long time and I know I've said this before

1024
00:48:07,423 --> 00:48:10,751
So much that you might not believe me this time but I bet bubbly

1025
00:48:11,007 --> 00:48:14,847
This time he definitely has and here here's what's going on man

1026
00:48:15,871 --> 00:48:18,431
It's a nefarious plan is that amazing

1027
00:48:19,455 --> 00:48:24,319
It's a who's who of elite scientists this is insane

1028
00:48:26,367 --> 00:48:27,391
Whatever you're going to be dead

1029
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:35,583
Really hurt you bad

1030
00:48:35,839 --> 00:48:36,351
I've always wanted

1031
00:48:36,607 --> 00:48:37,119
It's in our blood

1032
00:48:37,887 --> 00:48:39,679
You're like that'll collapse Society

1033
00:48:45,055 --> 00:48:47,103
I want to bring down civilization

1034
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:48,639
Industrial world

1035
00:48:51,455 --> 00:48:52,479
Civilization

1036
00:48:58,111 --> 00:49:00,415
This is a psychological weapon of fear

1037
00:49:21,151 --> 00:49:21,919
1,000-point Plus

1038
00:49:22,175 --> 00:49:22,687
Thousand

1039
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:30,367
I thought you were dizzy

1040
00:49:31,391 --> 00:49:32,415
That's why they did it

1041
00:49:33,695 --> 00:49:34,463
Define onto it

1042
00:49:34,719 --> 00:49:35,999
Trump

1043
00:49:36,255 --> 00:49:40,351
Nationalism

1044
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:43,167
Defending it even as it starts killing everybody

1045
00:49:44,191 --> 00:49:49,567
You're cute that you're talking to you

1046
00:49:50,591 --> 00:49:53,151
Describes all the stuff that he did

1047
00:49:54,175 --> 00:49:56,223
You just described all the stuff that he did

1048
00:49:56,479 --> 00:49:56,991
It's

1049
00:49:57,247 --> 00:49:58,527
Very sad

1050
00:49:59,551 --> 00:50:05,183
Although it's it's hilarious the end of the clip being like these are sophisticated people after he lays out the stupidest

1051
00:50:05,439 --> 00:50:06,719
Over my love

1052
00:50:07,231 --> 00:50:09,279
If that's so annoying

1053
00:50:09,535 --> 00:50:10,815
That's so annoying because

1054
00:50:11,071 --> 00:50:13,375
He's making it up and then he's complimenting himself

1055
00:50:13,887 --> 00:50:14,655
Yeah that's the problem

1056
00:50:15,167 --> 00:50:16,447
No he's giving himself a

1057
00:50:16,703 --> 00:50:20,031
Compliment about how brilliant his enemies are

1058
00:50:20,543 --> 00:50:21,567
Because the plan here

1059
00:50:21,823 --> 00:50:24,383
Meet up for them to have

1060
00:50:24,639 --> 00:50:25,663
Yes

1061
00:50:25,919 --> 00:50:28,991
The plan that he came up for them with them

1062
00:50:29,247 --> 00:50:29,759
Is

1063
00:50:30,015 --> 00:50:31,039
Something about how like

1064
00:50:31,551 --> 00:50:34,623
His worldview and his god king

1065
00:50:34,879 --> 00:50:37,695
Are so important and so powerful

1066
00:50:37,951 --> 00:50:42,815
That the global is needed to use a worldwide plague in order to discredit him

1067
00:50:43,071 --> 00:50:44,095
Discredit Trump

1068
00:50:44,351 --> 00:50:46,143
We had to do

1069
00:50:46,399 --> 00:50:47,679
That's the man

1070
00:50:47,935 --> 00:50:51,007
That is the level of narcissism that's really hard to wrap your head

1071
00:50:51,263 --> 00:50:53,567
Exactly the word I would use

1072
00:50:53,823 --> 00:50:54,591
Yeah it's

1073
00:50:54,847 --> 00:50:56,127
So

1074
00:50:56,639 --> 00:50:57,151
So

1075
00:50:57,407 --> 00:50:58,687
Small-minded

1076
00:50:58,943 --> 00:50:59,455
Yeah

1077
00:50:59,711 --> 00:51:05,599
That's that's how you get to do that for a job

1078
00:51:06,111 --> 00:51:07,903
This must be about me

1079
00:51:10,463 --> 00:51:14,047
That's what I'm saying if you didn't have this fur if Alex wasn't doing this

1080
00:51:14,303 --> 00:51:14,815
If you was just

1081
00:51:15,071 --> 00:51:15,839
A person

1082
00:51:17,375 --> 00:51:18,143
Your job

1083
00:51:18,399 --> 00:51:19,935
You be like we need to talk

1084
00:51:20,191 --> 00:51:23,519
To doctors about you this is what needs to happen

1085
00:51:24,031 --> 00:51:25,311
Somehow you can just either

1086
00:51:25,823 --> 00:51:27,871
Okay either we all agree yugos

1087
00:51:28,383 --> 00:51:29,663
Go to doctors or you get a show

1088
00:51:29,919 --> 00:51:36,063
Does the only two things that we can do for people with your level of delusion now I should tell you that

1089
00:51:36,319 --> 00:51:39,135
Plane that crashed in Malaysia and somehow

1090
00:51:39,647 --> 00:51:40,415
This was an attack

1091
00:51:40,671 --> 00:51:43,231
On me

1092
00:51:45,023 --> 00:51:47,839
I could tell you exactly about

1093
00:51:48,351 --> 00:51:54,495
How this plane crash relates to me but I don't have time for that I prepare too much I got to go to break

1094
00:51:54,751 --> 00:51:57,567
Just know that they're willing to kill me because of this plane crash

1095
00:51:57,823 --> 00:51:59,103
And what I know about it

1096
00:51:59,359 --> 00:52:01,151
So Alex has proven his point

1097
00:52:02,175 --> 00:52:02,943
Stand

1098
00:52:03,199 --> 00:52:04,735
I think he thinks he still hasn't talking

1099
00:52:05,247 --> 00:52:07,039
Talk about this British British story

1100
00:52:09,855 --> 00:52:11,391
Is completely confirmed

1101
00:52:11,903 --> 00:52:13,183
Absolutely confirmed

1102
00:52:13,695 --> 00:52:17,791
Doesn't help you hurt you and makes you spread

1103
00:52:18,047 --> 00:52:20,607
All the scientists at over a year ago.

1104
00:52:25,215 --> 00:52:28,031
Wolcott in and I'll even hit the stage

1105
00:52:34,431 --> 00:52:40,575
2.625 billion day weather

1106
00:52:40,831 --> 00:52:43,391
Policy truth baby

1107
00:52:44,415 --> 00:52:45,183
Awful

1108
00:52:45,439 --> 00:52:47,487
I don't know I don't know what

1109
00:52:47,743 --> 00:52:49,023
He considers covering a story

1110
00:52:49,279 --> 00:52:52,607
Experience is about as

1111
00:52:53,119 --> 00:52:56,191
Deep is he get something to erase on some stuff every now and again

1112
00:52:56,703 --> 00:52:58,239
You covered the story

1113
00:52:58,495 --> 00:53:02,847
According to my estimation at least three or four times at this episode I haven't gotten

1114
00:53:03,103 --> 00:53:06,687
To this news I mean

1115
00:53:06,943 --> 00:53:08,991
In many ways you haven't

1116
00:53:10,783 --> 00:53:11,295
But

1117
00:53:11,551 --> 00:53:13,087
I suppose it by your definition you have

1118
00:53:13,343 --> 00:53:15,391
As much as he's ever going to

1119
00:53:15,647 --> 00:53:20,511
That's a good way of putting the number

1120
00:53:20,767 --> 00:53:21,791
2.65 billion

1121
00:53:22,815 --> 00:53:24,607
I love the idea

1122
00:53:24,863 --> 00:53:25,375
That

1123
00:53:26,143 --> 00:53:27,679
No one would do anything about that

1124
00:53:28,447 --> 00:53:29,215
That is like

1125
00:53:30,751 --> 00:53:32,799
As as millions of people are dying

1126
00:53:33,311 --> 00:53:37,151
Everybody's going to be like what let's just wait let's ride this out and see how many go down

1127
00:53:37,407 --> 00:53:41,503
Like there's even if it was this there would be a very serious reaction

1128
00:53:41,759 --> 00:53:43,807
Long before we ever hit 1 billion

1129
00:53:44,063 --> 00:53:45,343
People I mean

1130
00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:46,111
I mean

1131
00:53:46,367 --> 00:53:47,391
Do remember when

1132
00:53:47,647 --> 00:53:48,159
Alex

1133
00:53:48,415 --> 00:53:50,207
And all of his people

1134
00:53:50,463 --> 00:53:53,535
And people in his intellectual and political sphere were saying

1135
00:53:54,047 --> 00:53:54,559
Let's just

1136
00:53:54,815 --> 00:53:56,351
Just keep going and not do anything

1137
00:53:58,399 --> 00:54:00,703
I mean I can kind of Imagine That Could Happen

1138
00:54:00,959 --> 00:54:01,983
That's fair for

1139
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:02,751
That's fair

1140
00:54:03,263 --> 00:54:07,359
So I was like all right I don't understand why Alex thinks he hasn't covered this story but

1141
00:54:07,871 --> 00:54:12,735
It was getting a little bit repetitive and then the exact opposite thing happened

1142
00:54:12,991 --> 00:54:14,015
Another was a story that I was

1143
00:54:14,271 --> 00:54:16,063
Begging him to get into

1144
00:54:16,575 --> 00:54:17,343
And it just

1145
00:54:17,855 --> 00:54:18,623
I hate I hate him

1146
00:54:19,391 --> 00:54:21,695
Heads of major medical school

1147
00:54:22,207 --> 00:54:22,719
Of the

1148
00:54:23,487 --> 00:54:25,279
Medical school

1149
00:54:28,607 --> 00:54:30,911
This is crazy and she's just

1150
00:54:31,167 --> 00:54:31,679
Today

1151
00:54:32,191 --> 00:54:36,287
I have no idea here what Alex is talking about like there's multiple Dean's

1152
00:54:36,543 --> 00:54:39,871
Different Medicals medical schools within Baylor

1153
00:54:40,127 --> 00:54:42,943
And I found one guy

1154
00:54:43,199 --> 00:54:44,735
Dr. Peter hotez

1155
00:54:44,991 --> 00:54:45,503
Has

1156
00:54:45,759 --> 00:54:47,551
He's had a lot of comments

1157
00:54:47,807 --> 00:54:50,111
It's about misinformation being horrible during the

1158
00:54:50,623 --> 00:54:51,903
Stand that make I'm not I don't think

1159
00:54:52,159 --> 00:54:53,695
That can possibly be the person who

1160
00:54:53,951 --> 00:54:56,255
Who Alex is talking about

1161
00:54:56,511 --> 00:54:57,023
That person

1162
00:54:57,279 --> 00:54:59,071
I don't know he said she though

1163
00:54:59,327 --> 00:55:00,095
In the Attic

1164
00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:03,679
The guy who I'm talking about dr. hotez he's the

1165
00:55:04,191 --> 00:55:07,775
The dean of the school of tropical medicine

1166
00:55:08,031 --> 00:55:09,823
School of Medicine the other school of medicine

1167
00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:11,103
His doctor Jennifer

1168
00:55:11,359 --> 00:55:11,871
Kris Jenner

1169
00:55:12,127 --> 00:55:15,199
We talked about her but I don't know what she said I can't find everything

1170
00:55:15,711 --> 00:55:17,247
But to imagine that you have this guy

1171
00:55:17,503 --> 00:55:20,831
Who's super anti misinformation about

1172
00:55:21,087 --> 00:55:23,135
About covid and about the pandemic

1173
00:55:23,391 --> 00:55:25,183
And then this other person who's like

1174
00:55:25,439 --> 00:55:30,303
Hey to all evil

1175
00:55:30,559 --> 00:55:35,167
Holy s*** that is diversity of opinion

1176
00:55:35,423 --> 00:55:37,215
That's exactly what the right says doesn't

1177
00:55:39,775 --> 00:55:42,847
At the same time like I'm listening to this episode

1178
00:55:43,615 --> 00:55:44,383
Without going on

1179
00:55:44,639 --> 00:55:46,687
Deep of wild goose chase

1180
00:55:47,967 --> 00:55:49,503
I don't know who he's talking about

1181
00:55:50,783 --> 00:55:53,599
I suppose if I was a vindictive propagandist

1182
00:55:54,111 --> 00:55:55,903
I would find somebody

1183
00:55:56,159 --> 00:55:59,231
Saying that misinformation was a real problem

1184
00:55:59,487 --> 00:55:59,999
To be offensive

1185
00:56:00,767 --> 00:56:01,791
And also Act

1186
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:05,631
And so I would then include them in my misinformation

1187
00:56:06,143 --> 00:56:06,911
As an insult

1188
00:56:07,423 --> 00:56:11,775
That could be what he's doing I'm not sure and maybe we'll learn more as the episode goes on

1189
00:56:12,287 --> 00:56:14,079
But at this point Alex other guests

1190
00:56:14,335 --> 00:56:16,639
The General

1191
00:56:17,407 --> 00:56:19,199
Canadian weird

1192
00:56:20,735 --> 00:56:23,039
I'm too much as I can cuz he's a Canadian weirdo

1193
00:56:24,831 --> 00:56:26,367
Back in September of last year

1194
00:56:26,879 --> 00:56:29,183
Was extremely prescient looking at their own

1195
00:56:29,439 --> 00:56:30,975
Government documents

1196
00:56:34,047 --> 00:56:35,327
Weather talking about the permanent

1197
00:56:36,607 --> 00:56:40,447
I forgot it

1198
00:56:40,959 --> 00:56:43,007
Has that we need to stop people demonstrating

1199
00:56:43,263 --> 00:56:45,055
People going outside cheap locked

1200
00:56:47,359 --> 00:56:47,871
People talking

1201
00:56:48,127 --> 00:56:49,407
That's a clip is actually

1202
00:56:49,663 --> 00:56:50,175
About a Prescott

1203
00:56:50,431 --> 00:56:51,199
Easy

1204
00:56:55,039 --> 00:57:01,183
Is not right when you have like a claim that put lock down the permanent and the things you come up with to reinforce your

1205
00:57:01,951 --> 00:57:03,487
Say something it says the opposite

1206
00:57:04,255 --> 00:57:04,767
It's strange

1207
00:57:05,023 --> 00:57:06,303
Vindictive propaganda

1208
00:57:07,583 --> 00:57:09,887
Also Chris guy he's a real weirdo

1209
00:57:10,399 --> 00:57:16,543
He's a he's a fellow whose dad runs a successful real estate development business in Canada and he's mysteriously the

1210
00:57:16,799 --> 00:57:18,079
The vice president of said company

1211
00:57:18,847 --> 00:57:22,687
He also has no kids yet he runs a group called Mothers Against social distancing

1212
00:57:23,455 --> 00:57:26,015
I got arrested this year for allegedly threatened

1213
00:57:26,527 --> 00:57:27,295
You kill a bunch of people

1214
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:29,855
This is a set-up

1215
00:57:31,391 --> 00:57:35,743
There's an awesome article advice by Mick lamoureux about his plan to

1216
00:57:35,999 --> 00:57:37,535
He's going to start a bunch

1217
00:57:37,791 --> 00:57:39,071
The Auntie mask schools

1218
00:57:39,583 --> 00:57:45,727
You might think that he was doing this with the money out of his like his own money because he's kind of heart disease charitable think so

1219
00:57:45,983 --> 00:57:49,567
GoFundMe

1220
00:57:50,335 --> 00:57:51,615
According to the article quote

1221
00:57:51,871 --> 00:57:53,919
In the enrollment agreement he shared apparent

1222
00:57:54,175 --> 00:57:59,295
Must accept that their kids might be taught by volunteer teachers with no personal accreditation

1223
00:57:59,551 --> 00:58:00,575
But with expert

1224
00:58:00,831 --> 00:58:02,367
Experience and education

1225
00:58:03,135 --> 00:58:04,159
That is a tough sell

1226
00:58:04,671 --> 00:58:05,695
Especially when you consider that in

1227
00:58:05,951 --> 00:58:09,023
Description section of the GoFundMe that he was using to start the schools

1228
00:58:09,279 --> 00:58:11,071
He misspelled public school as pubic

1229
00:58:11,327 --> 00:58:16,959
Welcome to Trump University because this is really fun here's another

1230
00:58:17,215 --> 00:58:17,983
From the article

1231
00:58:19,007 --> 00:58:21,311
Guy didn't respond to a detailed list of

1232
00:58:21,567 --> 00:58:23,615
Question said by Vice news about his project

1233
00:58:24,127 --> 00:58:27,455
Answer the questions were sent sky made several social media posts

1234
00:58:27,711 --> 00:58:29,503
Sabaton upcoming Vice news story about it

1235
00:58:29,759 --> 00:58:34,367
Hey what you implied I was a pedophile and George Soros directly ordered me to write this piece

1236
00:58:34,623 --> 00:58:38,207
Add shared my phone number to his followers

1237
00:58:39,999 --> 00:58:41,791
Cool guy

1238
00:58:42,047 --> 00:58:43,839
Yeah yeah

1239
00:58:46,399 --> 00:58:52,543
How do I give a flamboyant Auntie Mass character and he's got a cool neck tattoo so he's got a bit of online detention

1240
00:58:52,799 --> 00:58:55,359
For him until he's been hanging out with Alex a little bit

1241
00:58:55,871 --> 00:58:57,151
Thursday Island about

1242
00:58:57,663 --> 00:58:59,967
That is grounds for Parental divorce

1243
00:59:00,223 --> 00:59:03,039
If I've ever heard that would like if your parents are like a

1244
00:59:03,295 --> 00:59:06,111
We're sending you to Chris Sky school you can be like

1245
00:59:06,367 --> 00:59:08,159
I'm leaving you goodbye

1246
00:59:08,415 --> 00:59:12,767
I'm getting a divorce from my parents

1247
00:59:13,279 --> 00:59:14,815
So I can listen to

1248
00:59:15,327 --> 00:59:18,399
This guy cuz I don't really care

1249
00:59:18,655 --> 00:59:24,799
Beaches schools

1250
00:59:25,055 --> 00:59:26,335
On a press conference where he is

1251
00:59:26,591 --> 00:59:30,943
Peppered with questions about school in general I think Alex would give him the most

1252
00:59:31,199 --> 00:59:33,503
Adversarial interview on the subject but

1253
00:59:34,015 --> 00:59:35,551
I already interested anyway

1254
00:59:35,807 --> 00:59:37,599
If you just can be cookie

1255
00:59:37,855 --> 00:59:40,927
Qatar Auntie masks I can get that anywhere he's not that into

1256
00:59:41,951 --> 00:59:43,743
After he leaves

1257
00:59:44,767 --> 00:59:45,279
Baylor Medical

1258
00:59:45,535 --> 00:59:46,047
School comes

1259
00:59:47,327 --> 00:59:50,655
3 University

1260
00:59:50,911 --> 00:59:51,935
I've got clips of

1261
00:59:52,191 --> 00:59:53,983
Medical school

1262
00:59:54,239 --> 00:59:56,031
Top heads

1263
00:59:56,287 --> 01:00:00,383
Coming out and saying what shots are deadly don't do it it's a disaster

1264
01:00:00,895 --> 01:00:02,687
All these other top scientist

1265
01:00:03,967 --> 01:00:04,735
I probably watched

1266
01:00:09,343 --> 01:00:12,671
I'm just clips of medical doctors and scientists not track down there

1267
01:00:12,927 --> 01:00:19,071
Curriculum vitae

1268
01:00:19,327 --> 01:00:21,887
74% of the new covid cases

1269
01:00:25,983 --> 01:00:28,031
I don't like how the first step of his research was

1270
01:00:28,287 --> 01:00:29,567
They're not an imposter

1271
01:00:30,591 --> 01:00:32,127
Yep yep checks out Alyssa

1272
01:00:32,383 --> 01:00:33,663
Look at the picture ID

1273
01:00:33,919 --> 01:00:34,943
A real person

1274
01:00:36,479 --> 01:00:41,599
Also on the same show that he's leaving his reporting on the story from Finland with a tweet

1275
01:00:42,367 --> 01:00:42,879
So great

1276
01:00:43,391 --> 01:00:44,927
That 7 hours is paid off

1277
01:00:45,183 --> 01:00:45,695
Awesome

1278
01:00:45,951 --> 01:00:52,095
I still don't know what's going on with this Baylor situation I'm interested

1279
01:00:52,351 --> 01:00:55,423
I'm interested I want to know what he's talking about

1280
01:00:55,679 --> 01:00:57,983
You got me on the hook

1281
01:00:58,495 --> 01:01:00,543
So Alex talks about one of the things

1282
01:01:00,799 --> 01:01:01,823
That he does best

1283
01:01:02,591 --> 01:01:03,103
My predict

1284
01:01:04,127 --> 01:01:05,407
He believes they predict

1285
01:01:05,663 --> 01:01:08,735
The best way to wake up the sheeple out there because they come true

1286
01:01:08,991 --> 01:01:10,271
And then blow mine

1287
01:01:11,295 --> 01:01:14,879
And it's really convenient to do whenever you don't bring up all the things you've been

1288
01:01:15,135 --> 01:01:21,279
Massively wrong about

1289
01:01:22,303 --> 01:01:22,815
Trouble

1290
01:01:23,071 --> 01:01:25,375
It's really easy to make predictions

1291
01:01:25,631 --> 01:01:31,007
And get them wrong and then still claim your right whenever you never face consequences for your actions

1292
01:01:31,263 --> 01:01:34,847
Easy to be a sniper when you are allowed to use like carpet bombing

1293
01:01:35,103 --> 01:01:40,991
Absolutely everything around Pawtucket

1294
01:01:44,575 --> 01:01:46,111
Predictions are King because

1295
01:01:46,623 --> 01:01:49,695
You're already awake if you listen you heard it you do your own research

1296
01:01:51,231 --> 01:01:54,303
The predictions I made in Chris kaimade and Mike Adams made

1297
01:01:55,583 --> 01:02:01,727
All of which were wrong

1298
01:02:02,751 --> 01:02:05,311
Okay when I see it

1299
01:02:05,567 --> 01:02:09,151
Otherwise people are buying them cheap

1300
01:02:10,175 --> 01:02:11,711
Exploit them emotionally

1301
01:02:11,967 --> 01:02:15,039
And then they'll wake up to the things that are true

1302
01:02:16,831 --> 01:02:17,855
I would say this

1303
01:02:19,903 --> 01:02:20,671
Bill Clinton

1304
01:02:20,927 --> 01:02:23,743
Ended up being the secretary-general of the United Nations

1305
01:02:24,255 --> 01:02:26,559
And then president of the United States again after

1306
01:02:26,815 --> 01:02:28,095
Hillary had a two terms

1307
01:02:28,607 --> 01:02:34,751
I would probably be freaking out that Alex called evaluate everything I've ever known about anyting ever

1308
01:02:35,775 --> 01:02:39,359
Fundamentally shatter by understanding of human beings

1309
01:02:39,615 --> 01:02:40,383
Forever

1310
01:02:40,639 --> 01:02:41,151
So yeah

1311
01:02:41,407 --> 01:02:44,223
Possibly a bike

1312
01:02:44,735 --> 01:02:46,015
We forget those bad

1313
01:02:47,039 --> 01:02:48,831
Pretend that these vague things

1314
01:02:49,087 --> 01:02:49,599
He said

1315
01:02:49,855 --> 01:02:50,367
Or Acura

1316
01:02:50,623 --> 01:02:53,183
People always like to go to those Nostradamus

1317
01:02:53,439 --> 01:02:57,535
Predictions that are a little bit vague and have plenty of room for interpretation however you want to do

1318
01:02:57,791 --> 01:02:58,559
You bet

1319
01:02:58,815 --> 01:02:59,583
So

1320
01:02:59,839 --> 01:03:01,119
Unfortunately I have bad news

1321
01:03:01,375 --> 01:03:02,143
Mike Adams

1322
01:03:02,399 --> 01:03:02,911
Amazon

1323
01:03:03,167 --> 01:03:04,447
But actually

1324
01:03:05,471 --> 01:03:08,287
Thinking about it and I kind of enjoy Mike Adams appearances now

1325
01:03:08,543 --> 01:03:09,055
Okay

1326
01:03:09,311 --> 01:03:10,847
I kind of understand him better

1327
01:03:11,103 --> 01:03:13,663
Okay just a dramatic

1328
01:03:13,919 --> 01:03:14,431
Like

1329
01:03:14,687 --> 01:03:15,199
Adolescent

1330
01:03:15,455 --> 01:03:16,735
Yeah he has

1331
01:03:17,247 --> 01:03:21,087
Almost I would say the emotional maturity of somebody who's

1332
01:03:21,343 --> 01:03:21,855
In

1333
01:03:23,903 --> 01:03:26,719
Maybe not a senior in high school

1334
01:03:27,231 --> 01:03:31,583
Like a junior he's one of those people who got rich enough where they don't have to grow up

1335
01:03:31,839 --> 01:03:34,911
I don't know I mean I'm sure he's responsible in like

1336
01:03:35,167 --> 01:03:36,447
She holds down whatever his

1337
01:03:36,703 --> 01:03:39,775
Is his businesses are inside

1338
01:03:40,031 --> 01:03:40,799
Play Ernie

1339
01:03:41,567 --> 01:03:46,687
I just think that he comes in and it's just everything is so over-the-top

1340
01:03:46,943 --> 01:03:48,991
And I kind of enjoy that

1341
01:03:50,015 --> 01:03:53,343
Is this fun narrative do that's going through the pandemic with him

1342
01:03:53,599 --> 01:03:59,743
Big Alex's best friend at the beginning right and then Alex tried to see if he could hang out with David I could David Icke was saying that there was

1343
01:03:59,999 --> 01:04:03,327
Is norovirus right back Adam got mad and went away for awhile

1344
01:04:03,583 --> 01:04:06,655
Now he's back at I wasn't hanging out with David Icke anymore

1345
01:04:06,911 --> 01:04:07,423
Jesus

1346
01:04:07,935 --> 01:04:13,055
There's just a weird fun high school thing going on with you

1347
01:04:13,567 --> 01:04:18,687
Frustrated with this Betty bulshit also comes along with High School drama

1348
01:04:19,199 --> 01:04:23,295
It also David Icke still has a section on Alex's website where he is

1349
01:04:23,807 --> 01:04:24,831
Posting videos

1350
01:04:25,087 --> 01:04:28,415
For no one to watch about how there is no virus

1351
01:04:29,439 --> 01:04:32,511
Which is great I'm glad platforming app

1352
01:04:32,767 --> 01:04:33,535
I do

1353
01:04:34,303 --> 01:04:35,071
Temp sensor anybody

1354
01:04:35,327 --> 01:04:37,887
I got you could he's much more easily with David Icke

1355
01:04:38,655 --> 01:04:39,167
But Nick Fuentes

1356
01:04:39,423 --> 01:04:39,935
I think

1357
01:04:40,959 --> 01:04:42,239
Anyway

1358
01:04:43,263 --> 01:04:43,775
A year ago

1359
01:04:44,287 --> 01:04:46,335
You may recall Mike Adams on coming to

1360
01:04:46,591 --> 01:04:47,103
Fragrant

1361
01:04:48,127 --> 01:04:48,639
What year ago

1362
01:04:48,895 --> 01:04:50,431
They're saying hospitals were full

1363
01:04:50,687 --> 01:04:51,455
Yes they were

1364
01:04:52,991 --> 01:04:53,503
Is Welch

1365
01:04:54,015 --> 01:04:55,039
Right but now

1366
01:04:55,295 --> 01:04:55,807
They are

1367
01:04:56,831 --> 01:04:59,903
The hospital

1368
01:05:01,183 --> 01:05:02,207
Cheer

1369
01:05:02,463 --> 01:05:05,791
I've got friends and family organ ospital. Crew twerking Hospital

1370
01:05:10,143 --> 01:05:10,911
Full of people dying

1371
01:05:11,423 --> 01:05:13,471
Inoculated

1372
01:05:18,335 --> 01:05:20,639
Inoculated

1373
01:05:20,895 --> 01:05:23,199
They've done it now here

1374
01:05:23,455 --> 01:05:25,247
This this is this is an interest

1375
01:05:25,503 --> 01:05:27,807
Sing reality that that he has us living in

1376
01:05:28,575 --> 01:05:29,087
No

1377
01:05:29,343 --> 01:05:30,111
I reject it

1378
01:05:30,367 --> 01:05:33,951
I rejected entirely this is unfair

1379
01:05:34,463 --> 01:05:35,231
F*** that f***

1380
01:05:35,487 --> 01:05:37,023
That so hard

1381
01:05:37,535 --> 01:05:38,559
F*** that

1382
01:05:41,631 --> 01:05:42,911
We remember that Mike Adams

1383
01:05:43,167 --> 01:05:45,727
Escalated over humanity and there would only be Lone Survivor

1384
01:05:45,983 --> 01:05:46,751
A ways back

1385
01:05:47,263 --> 01:05:48,031
He hasn't Newport

1386
01:05:48,799 --> 01:05:49,823
That made

1387
01:05:50,079 --> 01:05:50,591
Rival

1388
01:05:50,847 --> 01:05:51,615
I don't know

1389
01:05:52,127 --> 01:05:54,687
Deescalate from it's over for Humanity

1390
01:05:54,943 --> 01:05:57,503
A little bit silly

1391
01:05:58,271 --> 01:05:59,551
I'll sit here right now today

1392
01:06:00,831 --> 01:06:02,367
Events have already been put into place

1393
01:06:03,135 --> 01:06:05,183
Going to see millions of people dead

1394
01:06:05,695 --> 01:06:06,463
In the next 12

1395
01:06:06,975 --> 01:06:07,999
36 months

1396
01:06:08,511 --> 01:06:09,791
Because of these vaccines

1397
01:06:10,047 --> 01:06:11,327
And it cannot be snowy

1398
01:06:11,839 --> 01:06:13,375
Many people today are Walking Dead

1399
01:06:13,887 --> 01:06:14,655
It cannot be stopped

1400
01:06:14,911 --> 01:06:20,287
What a predictions events have been put into commotion there you know it within the next couple years

1401
01:06:20,543 --> 01:06:22,079
Millions Dead from the vaccine

1402
01:06:23,615 --> 01:06:28,479
That would still be way better than if we didn't have the f****** vaccine

1403
01:06:28,735 --> 01:06:30,015
Conceivably

1404
01:06:30,271 --> 01:06:30,783
It also

1405
01:06:31,039 --> 01:06:35,135
Is outrageously inaccurate

1406
01:06:35,647 --> 01:06:38,463
I would guess this is one of the predictions that is going to go in the

1407
01:06:38,719 --> 01:06:41,023
Bill Clinton as Secretary General basket

1408
01:06:41,535 --> 01:06:42,047
Open forget we did

1409
01:06:42,303 --> 01:06:44,351
This morning they're going to let that one go

1410
01:06:44,607 --> 01:06:45,119
So

1411
01:06:45,887 --> 01:06:46,911
Mike blue my mind

1412
01:06:47,167 --> 01:06:48,447
For a little while

1413
01:06:48,703 --> 01:06:50,751
He seems to think

1414
01:06:51,775 --> 01:06:52,287
But there's a bigger

1415
01:06:52,543 --> 01:06:53,055
2 plan

1416
01:06:53,311 --> 01:06:53,823
Going on

1417
01:06:54,079 --> 01:06:54,847
Bright

1418
01:06:56,383 --> 01:06:59,455
All these news reports that are coming out about how people are vaccinated can

1419
01:06:59,711 --> 01:07:03,295
Still you know the Delta variant might be transmissible

1420
01:07:04,831 --> 01:07:06,111
Find it the really trying to

1421
01:07:06,367 --> 01:07:07,135
The trying to cause

1422
01:07:07,647 --> 01:07:09,183
The tried to cause a reaction

1423
01:07:09,951 --> 01:07:13,023
The reason they've done this and the reason that they've admitted now

1424
01:07:13,279 --> 01:07:14,047
Over the last week

1425
01:07:15,071 --> 01:07:15,583
Vaccines

1426
01:07:15,839 --> 01:07:16,351
Don't work

1427
01:07:16,607 --> 01:07:17,887
And that they're causing

1428
01:07:18,911 --> 01:07:20,703
Of these so-called Delta

1429
01:07:23,519 --> 01:07:24,031
Want

1430
01:07:24,799 --> 01:07:25,311
Uprising

1431
01:07:25,567 --> 01:07:26,079
In America

1432
01:07:26,335 --> 01:07:26,847
This is bait

1433
01:07:27,615 --> 01:07:31,455
They want an uprising even among those who were vaccinated and then are now

1434
01:07:31,711 --> 01:07:34,527
Angry and coming to their senses and saying

1435
01:07:35,039 --> 01:07:36,575
They want a massive uprising

1436
01:07:37,087 --> 01:07:38,367
Cuz they need adjustment kaisha

1437
01:07:38,623 --> 01:07:39,647
Foreign military

1438
01:07:40,671 --> 01:07:41,439
Martial law

1439
01:07:41,695 --> 01:07:42,463
Crackdown

1440
01:07:42,975 --> 01:07:44,255
In order to cover their tracks

1441
01:07:44,511 --> 01:07:45,535
Because their entire

1442
01:07:45,791 --> 01:07:47,071
Globulus system is about

1443
01:07:47,327 --> 01:07:48,095
To employ

1444
01:07:48,607 --> 01:07:49,631
And many of them are going to go to pray

1445
01:07:49,887 --> 01:07:50,399
Prison order

1446
01:07:51,423 --> 01:07:53,471
Tried under Nuremberg 2.0

1447
01:07:53,727 --> 01:07:56,287
Yazoo apparently apparently

1448
01:07:56,543 --> 01:07:57,311
They are telling

1449
01:07:57,567 --> 01:07:59,871
Everyone that the vaccines don't work in order to

1450
01:08:00,127 --> 01:08:00,895
To try and get people

1451
01:08:01,151 --> 01:08:01,663
Go to

1452
01:08:01,919 --> 01:08:02,687
Freak out

1453
01:08:02,943 --> 01:08:03,455
Sandra Bell

1454
01:08:03,967 --> 01:08:08,063
The Maccabees put down by a military coup or some sort of

1455
01:08:08,319 --> 01:08:09,855
Martial law

1456
01:08:10,111 --> 01:08:10,623
Distract from

1457
01:08:10,879 --> 01:08:11,647
The fact that

1458
01:08:12,159 --> 01:08:12,671
Tabaxi

1459
01:08:13,951 --> 01:08:14,719
Don't working

1460
01:08:16,511 --> 01:08:17,023
I don't know

1461
01:08:17,279 --> 01:08:22,399
A really sophisticated people if that's what we're dealing with we're dealing with

1462
01:08:22,655 --> 01:08:24,447
Genius is a fun story

1463
01:08:25,215 --> 01:08:25,727
Not

1464
01:08:26,239 --> 01:08:27,263
It's not that funny story

1465
01:08:27,519 --> 01:08:28,031
Define

1466
01:08:28,287 --> 01:08:29,055
Story

1467
01:08:29,311 --> 01:08:30,079
I wouldn't read it

1468
01:08:30,335 --> 01:08:33,151
What kind of Uprising over there what kind of Uprising is a look

1469
01:08:33,407 --> 01:08:34,943
Looking for you know like do they have a boot

1470
01:08:35,199 --> 01:08:40,063
Teak Uprising that they want that would be optimal for them or do they do they want more like a

1471
01:08:40,319 --> 01:08:41,343
Graduated in

1472
01:08:41,599 --> 01:08:47,743
Insurgency kind of thing do you know that burning down a police station isn't enough to bring in martial law so I don't

1473
01:08:47,999 --> 01:08:50,303
I don't know what they're trying to

1474
01:08:50,559 --> 01:08:52,095
I mean not even

1475
01:08:52,351 --> 01:08:56,703
Trying to overthrow the government installed martial law

1476
01:08:56,959 --> 01:08:57,471
Yes

1477
01:08:57,727 --> 01:08:58,239
Anyway

1478
01:08:58,495 --> 01:08:59,519
Mike believes

1479
01:08:59,775 --> 01:09:00,799
That if you've been back

1480
01:09:01,055 --> 01:09:01,567
Vaccinated

1481
01:09:01,823 --> 01:09:03,615
And this is actually something he's been saying quite a bit

1482
01:09:04,127 --> 01:09:06,687
I remember hearing him say

1483
01:09:06,943 --> 01:09:07,967
Even though our ways back

1484
01:09:08,479 --> 01:09:09,247
He's basically like

1485
01:09:09,503 --> 01:09:12,063
You're a biological weapons Factory

1486
01:09:12,831 --> 01:09:15,135
The people who been vaccinated are walking

1487
01:09:15,391 --> 01:09:17,183
Intubation vessels

1488
01:09:19,231 --> 01:09:20,511
Weapons

1489
01:09:20,767 --> 01:09:21,791
It's all happening on

1490
01:09:22,047 --> 01:09:22,559
Purpose

1491
01:09:23,327 --> 01:09:29,215
Therapy injections which are highly illegal

1492
01:09:32,543 --> 01:09:33,311
That's right that's right

1493
01:09:33,567 --> 01:09:34,079
Hellboy

1494
01:09:34,335 --> 01:09:35,359
Better not better.

1495
01:09:35,615 --> 01:09:39,455
Explore this logic to its to his conclusion

1496
01:09:39,711 --> 01:09:44,575
Where is for the sake of protecting everyone you might have to kill vaccinated people

1497
01:09:45,087 --> 01:09:45,855
Scrape

1498
01:09:46,367 --> 01:09:48,671
They're there at this place now we're there

1499
01:09:48,927 --> 01:09:50,463
Like they've taken Karl rove's

1500
01:09:50,975 --> 01:09:52,511
Do you know that that

1501
01:09:52,767 --> 01:09:54,047
Turn a strength into a week

1502
01:09:54,303 --> 01:09:56,863
Miss that Swift boat kind of thing you know you're a veteran so

1503
01:09:57,119 --> 01:09:58,399
Destroy that credibility

1504
01:09:58,655 --> 01:10:00,959
They have just turned that on reality itself

1505
01:10:01,471 --> 01:10:01,983
Just a come

1506
01:10:02,239 --> 01:10:02,751
Complete like

1507
01:10:03,263 --> 01:10:09,407
If you're vaccinated you're the one who's incubating the virus and spreading it see hahaha it's definitely not

1508
01:10:09,663 --> 01:10:14,015
All of us unvaccinated people who spread it around all the time because we don't even f****** believe that it

1509
01:10:15,551 --> 01:10:21,695
Spreading the disease

1510
01:10:21,951 --> 01:10:28,095
What's work with Jerome corsi for years voters

1511
01:10:28,351 --> 01:10:30,655
Rex attack on reality

1512
01:10:31,167 --> 01:10:32,703
Right at the

1513
01:10:32,959 --> 01:10:36,799
Face of reality not trying to avoid it or even allow for it to come into a

1514
01:10:38,335 --> 01:10:39,359
So f****** intense

1515
01:10:40,127 --> 01:10:41,407
So I gave Mike a little bit too much

1516
01:10:41,663 --> 01:10:42,431
Credit too early

1517
01:10:42,943 --> 01:10:44,735
I told you that he was blowing my mind

1518
01:10:46,015 --> 01:10:47,295
Those clips that played or not blowing

1519
01:10:47,551 --> 01:10:48,319
They weren't doing much

1520
01:10:49,599 --> 01:10:50,111
We're going to get into

1521
01:10:50,623 --> 01:10:52,671
Mike bring some heavy s*** here

1522
01:10:53,183 --> 01:10:53,951
You might notice

1523
01:10:54,719 --> 01:10:55,743
Littlest woke

1524
01:10:55,999 --> 01:10:56,511
Corporation

1525
01:10:57,791 --> 01:11:00,863
All these corporations that are like really

1526
01:11:01,119 --> 01:11:01,887
Woke

1527
01:11:02,143 --> 01:11:02,911
We'll have the ones

1528
01:11:03,167 --> 01:11:04,191
The donated to Trump campaign

1529
01:11:04,703 --> 01:11:06,239
No other kind of

1530
01:11:07,007 --> 01:11:09,055
Okay they're making their employees get back

1531
01:11:09,567 --> 01:11:11,103
Yes that's very welcome

1532
01:11:12,639 --> 01:11:15,199
The real shocker here has have you noticed over the last week

1533
01:11:15,711 --> 01:11:16,479
All of the so-called

1534
01:11:16,735 --> 01:11:17,247
Woke Corp

1535
01:11:17,503 --> 01:11:18,015
Reparations

1536
01:11:18,527 --> 01:11:22,111
Have now demanding mandatory vaccines among their own workers so we're talk

1537
01:11:23,135 --> 01:11:23,903
Google Twitter

1538
01:11:24,159 --> 01:11:28,511
Disney Walmart even the Washington Post and many other corporations like that

1539
01:11:29,023 --> 01:11:31,839
They know that they are ordering the VAC

1540
01:11:32,095 --> 01:11:34,143
Maxine Slaughter of Their Own

1541
01:11:34,655 --> 01:11:36,703
People

1542
01:11:37,215 --> 01:11:41,055
And you ask why why would they do that well at Google and particular

1543
01:11:41,567 --> 01:11:45,151
And by the way Zack has been explaining all of this

1544
01:11:45,663 --> 01:11:46,431
Google

1545
01:11:46,943 --> 01:11:47,711
Humans have been

1546
01:11:47,967 --> 01:11:48,479
Teaching

1547
01:11:48,735 --> 01:11:50,783
Google machine Learning System

1548
01:11:51,039 --> 01:11:52,319
AI systems for the last

1549
01:11:52,831 --> 01:11:53,343
5 years

1550
01:11:53,599 --> 01:11:56,415
How to no longer need humans in the loop

1551
01:11:56,671 --> 01:12:02,815
Thompson moderations Corporation

1552
01:12:03,071 --> 01:12:06,655
Lower the drawbridge

1553
01:12:06,911 --> 01:12:08,959
Always gets executed by the army that takes over

1554
01:12:11,519 --> 01:12:13,567
I got to say I think

1555
01:12:13,823 --> 01:12:16,895
I think that might be the first time you stood up laughing

1556
01:12:17,151 --> 01:12:21,759
I was a big one one got you I wasn't ready for it I want ready for it

1557
01:12:22,015 --> 01:12:28,159
I wasn't ready for him to respond to that like the Twisted of sci-fi movies

1558
01:12:28,415 --> 01:12:30,975
Show Melania

1559
01:12:31,487 --> 01:12:36,351
Ocean's 11 where they reveal the Bland of the end what are you guys talking

1560
01:12:38,399 --> 01:12:44,287
Corporation employees with vaccinations

1561
01:12:44,543 --> 01:12:45,311
Or

1562
01:12:46,079 --> 01:12:47,103
You could kill the ball

1563
01:12:47,871 --> 01:12:48,639
Okay

1564
01:12:48,895 --> 01:12:53,247
Okay interesting strategy from Google we're going to see how this one plays out going forward

1565
01:12:59,391 --> 01:13:00,159
Deserves an

1566
01:13:01,183 --> 01:13:02,975
Whatever

1567
01:13:03,231 --> 01:13:04,511
Hi Mike cool cool

1568
01:13:05,023 --> 01:13:05,535
Anything else

1569
01:13:07,583 --> 01:13:09,375
The globalists are now

1570
01:13:09,631 --> 01:13:10,399
Acting as if

1571
01:13:10,655 --> 01:13:12,191
They have knowledge of

1572
01:13:12,959 --> 01:13:13,983
Global level

1573
01:13:14,239 --> 01:13:15,263
Mass extinction

1574
01:13:16,543 --> 01:13:17,055
For threat

1575
01:13:17,567 --> 01:13:19,615
Probably one that they're going to unleash

1576
01:13:20,127 --> 01:13:22,687
They want to make sure that there are billions

1577
01:13:23,967 --> 01:13:24,991
Human beings around

1578
01:13:25,503 --> 01:13:26,015
When that happens

1579
01:13:26,271 --> 01:13:27,039
Because they can't

1580
01:13:27,551 --> 01:13:29,087
Control billions of people

1581
01:13:29,855 --> 01:13:31,135
When people realize they've been lied to

1582
01:13:31,391 --> 01:13:32,415
And they been poisoned

1583
01:13:32,671 --> 01:13:33,183
And they're being killed

1584
01:13:37,535 --> 01:13:43,679
Third-dimensional chance

1585
01:13:50,591 --> 01:13:51,359
Very desperate

1586
01:13:52,639 --> 01:13:54,175
Yeah but my apologies I

1587
01:13:54,431 --> 01:13:59,807
I do tend to just leap ahead because you and I have a knowledge base and your listeners have

1588
01:14:00,319 --> 01:14:01,343
Set the average American

1589
01:14:01,599 --> 01:14:02,111
Is just clueless

1590
01:14:02,367 --> 01:14:03,391
What about soy

1591
01:14:04,671 --> 01:14:06,207
Look man we are so smart

1592
01:14:06,463 --> 01:14:12,607
But sometimes I go a2c on you like a way out improv troupe

1593
01:14:12,863 --> 01:14:13,375
Big leaps

1594
01:14:13,631 --> 01:14:14,911
Oh man

1595
01:14:15,167 --> 01:14:15,935
So I was a little

1596
01:14:16,191 --> 01:14:16,703
Confused

1597
01:14:16,959 --> 01:14:19,519
Yeah

1598
01:14:19,775 --> 01:14:20,799
Thankfully Mike

1599
01:14:21,055 --> 01:14:25,151
Mike is it does nothing is not a teacher clarify this

1600
01:14:25,663 --> 01:14:26,687
Let's just say

1601
01:14:28,223 --> 01:14:30,015
Giant asteroid we're going to hit the

1602
01:14:32,831 --> 01:14:34,111
Never going to happen in

1603
01:14:37,439 --> 01:14:38,207
Tell the people

1604
01:14:38,463 --> 01:14:38,975
No

1605
01:14:39,487 --> 01:14:40,511
They would never tell you

1606
01:14:40,767 --> 01:14:42,815
You wouldn't know until you see it in the sky a giant

1607
01:14:43,071 --> 01:14:43,839
Flaming Mountain

1608
01:14:44,095 --> 01:14:45,375
In the Book of Revelation

1609
01:14:45,887 --> 01:14:48,447
The reason I wouldn't tell you is because the globalist need

1610
01:14:48,959 --> 01:14:49,471
The infrastructure

1611
01:14:50,751 --> 01:14:51,263
So they can

1612
01:14:51,519 --> 01:14:52,287
Continue to stop

1613
01:14:52,543 --> 01:14:53,311
Pile food

1614
01:14:54,847 --> 01:14:55,615
Fuel and all the things

1615
01:14:55,871 --> 01:15:02,015
Teton there private islands and underground cities okay and everything

1616
01:15:02,271 --> 01:15:03,039
BattleBots

1617
01:15:03,295 --> 01:15:04,831
They have everything now

1618
01:15:06,111 --> 01:15:06,879
They have it all

1619
01:15:11,999 --> 01:15:12,767
If they told people that

1620
01:15:13,279 --> 01:15:14,047
Everybody Woodstock

1621
01:15:15,071 --> 01:15:16,095
Everybody would go home

1622
01:15:16,351 --> 01:15:19,167
And decide you know how I want to spend my last 500 Days on this

1623
01:15:19,679 --> 01:15:20,191
Probably with

1624
01:15:20,703 --> 01:15:25,311
Family or something.

1625
01:15:25,823 --> 01:15:29,407
Oh my God

1626
01:15:30,943 --> 01:15:31,711
We can infer

1627
01:15:31,967 --> 01:15:32,991
From their behavior

1628
01:15:33,247 --> 01:15:34,527
Why are they going to the private

1629
01:15:34,783 --> 01:15:35,295
Why are they

1630
01:15:35,551 --> 01:15:41,183
Building underground tunnels

1631
01:15:41,695 --> 01:15:42,463
This is wild

1632
01:15:42,719 --> 01:15:48,863
This is watching nine-year-old argue over a book report that neither of them did

1633
01:15:49,119 --> 01:15:49,631
Describe his authority

1634
01:15:49,887 --> 01:15:52,703
Experiment is if you're like likes experimenting with

1635
01:15:52,959 --> 01:15:54,239
He's really trying

1636
01:15:54,495 --> 01:15:58,079
He's playing third dimensional chess I will say that

1637
01:15:58,335 --> 01:15:59,359
The bike the globalist

1638
01:15:59,615 --> 01:16:01,663
Never tell the public in an asteroid we're going

1639
01:16:01,919 --> 01:16:02,431
Going to collide with

1640
01:16:02,687 --> 01:16:04,479
The Earth because they need infrastructure.

1641
01:16:04,735 --> 01:16:05,503
Continue to exist

1642
01:16:05,759 --> 01:16:07,039
Until the last minute so they can

1643
01:16:07,295 --> 01:16:09,343
Can stockpile resources and their bunkers are whatever

1644
01:16:10,111 --> 01:16:13,695
If they told people you know with all in the public that they had x amount

1645
01:16:13,951 --> 01:16:15,487
A time before imminent demise

1646
01:16:15,743 --> 01:16:16,767
People just stopped working

1647
01:16:17,023 --> 01:16:20,607
Families which would hurt the globalist ability to get those last minutes

1648
01:16:20,863 --> 01:16:22,655
Supplies they apparently need in their bunker

1649
01:16:23,679 --> 01:16:24,191
Wow

1650
01:16:24,447 --> 01:16:24,959
Parts

1651
01:16:25,215 --> 01:16:27,519
What what a great

1652
01:16:27,775 --> 01:16:30,335
Like here's the best part of that

1653
01:16:30,591 --> 01:16:34,687
Is the best part of that they truly believe that and extinction level events

1654
01:16:34,943 --> 01:16:36,223
What it would be like

1655
01:16:36,479 --> 01:16:37,247
Listen guys

1656
01:16:38,015 --> 01:16:39,039
We got to wait

1657
01:16:39,295 --> 01:16:45,439
Three business days before the money transfer over there

1658
01:16:46,719 --> 01:16:47,999
We can't end the world yet

1659
01:16:48,255 --> 01:16:54,399
My food is

1660
01:16:54,655 --> 01:16:59,263
Oh God we got to wait till the world ends hold off

1661
01:16:59,519 --> 01:17:01,823
Push it back supposed to be in my bunker without

1662
01:17:02,079 --> 01:17:03,359
Fresh fruit

1663
01:17:03,615 --> 01:17:04,383
Oh my God

1664
01:17:05,407 --> 01:17:10,015
Fortune reception is all I have in my bunker right now do you really think I'm going to live out the end of the world with that no

1665
01:17:10,783 --> 01:17:12,575
It's it's amazing Jesus

1666
01:17:12,831 --> 01:17:18,975
Simultaneously though this entire show and makes initial Point has to do with public messaging around the pandemic shifting to the globalist

1667
01:17:19,231 --> 01:17:21,791
Submitting that the vaccines don't work in that everyone's going to die

1668
01:17:22,303 --> 01:17:27,423
According to bikes only thought experiment the globalist are acting in a way that they never would if a disaster

1669
01:17:27,679 --> 01:17:28,447
Truly working

1670
01:17:29,215 --> 01:17:31,519
This s***'s about to go really bad and if that's

1671
01:17:31,775 --> 01:17:34,079
The case there would be stories about breaks

1672
01:17:34,335 --> 01:17:35,615
Suitcases on the Delta Varian

1673
01:17:36,383 --> 01:17:37,407
Stop I don't under

1674
01:17:37,663 --> 01:17:38,687
Understand and honestly

1675
01:17:39,455 --> 01:17:41,759
This stuff is the most infantile nonsensical garbage

1676
01:17:43,039 --> 01:17:44,575
I do kind of like listen

1677
01:17:44,831 --> 01:17:45,343
Link to this

1678
01:17:46,111 --> 01:17:52,255
Alex and him really seem like they're having a good time that's a problem they're both they're both like

1679
01:17:52,767 --> 01:17:57,119
Bouncing off each other like a great bulshit we're sitting right here this is the good stuff

1680
01:17:57,375 --> 01:17:57,887
Nothing like

1681
01:17:58,399 --> 01:17:59,423
To blow each other's minds

1682
01:18:01,727 --> 01:18:04,287
You don't want Alex says that someone's hit like

1683
01:18:04,543 --> 01:18:10,175
In this episode he says that like Mike Adams has a hook and always a farm here in Texas need a good friend

1684
01:18:10,431 --> 01:18:11,711
I believe that

1685
01:18:12,223 --> 01:18:13,759
Makes me sadder that he couldn't

1686
01:18:14,015 --> 01:18:15,295
Come on the show and Alex's pretend

1687
01:18:15,551 --> 01:18:17,599
Tecovas

1688
01:18:18,111 --> 01:18:21,183
Healthy to have a good time with each other anyways that like

1689
01:18:21,439 --> 01:18:23,487
Steve pieczenik is a power imbalance

1690
01:18:23,743 --> 01:18:26,303
Alex abuses a bunch of other guests

1691
01:18:26,559 --> 01:18:27,839
The talks over them and doesn't

1692
01:18:28,095 --> 01:18:29,375
Give them a chance

1693
01:18:29,631 --> 01:18:30,911
What's to say stupid s*** like Mike

1694
01:18:31,679 --> 01:18:34,751
I think human women like actually are probably friends yeah

1695
01:18:35,007 --> 01:18:39,103
Yeah he and Mike have the relationship that Owen thinks Alex and Owen have

1696
01:18:39,615 --> 01:18:40,383
Yeah

1697
01:18:40,895 --> 01:18:41,407
Yeah

1698
01:18:42,431 --> 01:18:44,223
But Alex knows that Owens is little baby boy

1699
01:18:44,479 --> 01:18:47,551
Cohen can't reflect my camp

1700
01:18:47,807 --> 01:18:50,367
Coming up with this good stuff

1701
01:18:50,623 --> 01:18:55,487
Never going to get up

1702
01:18:59,839 --> 01:19:00,863
Mike has more thought

1703
01:19:01,887 --> 01:19:04,191
And out why do they not care that they are at

1704
01:19:04,447 --> 01:19:05,727
Absolutely destroying the rep

1705
01:19:05,983 --> 01:19:06,495
Mutation

1706
01:19:06,751 --> 01:19:08,287
Of the CDC

1707
01:19:08,799 --> 01:19:11,871
Vaccine industry who

1708
01:19:12,127 --> 01:19:12,639
Itself

1709
01:19:12,895 --> 01:19:14,687
Answer because none of those things

1710
01:19:15,455 --> 01:19:19,039
Existing their plan in a few years

1711
01:19:27,487 --> 01:19:28,255
Anyway

1712
01:19:28,511 --> 01:19:29,023
Okay so then

1713
01:19:29,279 --> 01:19:34,911
The next couple years all this stuff is going to be gone according to their plans and dollar is gone

1714
01:19:35,423 --> 01:19:38,751
This is like the grand unified field theory of s*** I don't know

1715
01:19:39,007 --> 01:19:45,151
That's just what they're just like okay all the stuff that I don't know I don't think they care about the banks isn't that crazy

1716
01:19:45,407 --> 01:19:49,503
Do you think I've ever heard anybody say they're not concerned with the reputation of the thing I've been

1717
01:19:49,759 --> 01:19:51,039
Smearing for years

1718
01:19:52,063 --> 01:19:52,575
Insane

1719
01:19:52,831 --> 01:19:57,183
Insane level of s*** where they can say this and their brains don't

1720
01:19:57,439 --> 01:19:57,951
Explode

1721
01:19:58,207 --> 01:20:03,583
It's mind-boggling unfair it is it's unfair

1722
01:20:04,095 --> 01:20:05,631
Great transition what are the things

1723
01:20:06,143 --> 01:20:07,935
We do these episodes in 2000

1724
01:20:08,447 --> 01:20:10,239
And one of the reasons I want to know if Alex

1725
01:20:10,495 --> 01:20:12,799
Thought he was fighting the literal devil in 2000

1726
01:20:13,311 --> 01:20:14,848
And the reason that I want to know that

1727
01:20:15,104 --> 01:20:17,408
Is because he's made it abundantly clear that he does

1728
01:20:18,944 --> 01:20:19,712
Enterprise absolute

1729
01:20:19,968 --> 01:20:21,760
And stuff like this

1730
01:20:22,016 --> 01:20:23,040
I just want to

1731
01:20:23,296 --> 01:20:23,808
Throw a brick at

1732
01:20:24,064 --> 01:20:24,576
My computer

1733
01:20:24,832 --> 01:20:28,160
Fleming's other analogy

1734
01:20:28,672 --> 01:20:29,440
2 years

1735
01:20:32,512 --> 01:20:35,584
And they just got a deal they get the spaceship but they don't kill us quietly and

1736
01:20:35,840 --> 01:20:37,888
You know I'll make sure nobody wakes up and then challenges

1737
01:20:41,216 --> 01:20:42,240
They're acting like

1738
01:20:42,496 --> 01:20:43,264
Everybody's dead

1739
01:20:44,544 --> 01:20:46,336
Unless they basically call us off

1740
01:20:50,432 --> 01:20:55,552
Can't talk behind that I'm not saying that this is what the what's going on to what they believe he's a

1741
01:20:56,064 --> 01:20:57,600
Illicitly multiple

1742
01:20:58,112 --> 01:21:00,160
Multiple-time said that this is what's going on

1743
01:21:00,672 --> 01:21:04,256
The devil is behind the globalist to give them their marching orders

1744
01:21:05,536 --> 01:21:06,560
Bulshit

1745
01:21:07,072 --> 01:21:07,584
B b

1746
01:21:08,352 --> 01:21:09,120
Come on man

1747
01:21:09,632 --> 01:21:10,400
No no

1748
01:21:10,656 --> 01:21:15,520
The cats out of the bag of toothpaste out of the tube you think you're fighting the f*** it saddle

1749
01:21:15,776 --> 01:21:19,872
Let me with anything that isn't ultimately about the devil trying to corrupt

1750
01:21:20,128 --> 01:21:22,688
Don't try and like

1751
01:21:23,200 --> 01:21:25,248
Retain some veneer

1752
01:21:26,272 --> 01:21:29,856
Some credibility of like no I don't actually think I'm fighting the devil

1753
01:21:30,624 --> 01:21:31,904
It's like a dignified the devil

1754
01:21:32,416 --> 01:21:32,928
So now

1755
01:21:33,696 --> 01:21:34,208
Predictions

1756
01:21:34,464 --> 01:21:34,976
Yes

1757
01:21:35,488 --> 01:21:36,768
That's how you blow the mind of the sheeple

1758
01:21:38,048 --> 01:21:38,560
Mike

1759
01:21:39,072 --> 01:21:39,584
Has

1760
01:21:39,840 --> 01:21:40,352
Some

1761
01:21:40,864 --> 01:21:41,376
Prediction

1762
01:21:42,400 --> 01:21:43,680
I have have it on

1763
01:21:44,192 --> 01:21:45,728
Bad Authority that he's on fire today

1764
01:21:47,776 --> 01:21:48,800
These are

1765
01:21:49,824 --> 01:21:51,104
Not good prediction

1766
01:21:51,616 --> 01:21:52,896
I'm intrigued by this

1767
01:21:53,152 --> 01:21:53,920
I'm trying to shut up

1768
01:21:58,528 --> 01:21:59,040
Short Circuit

1769
01:21:59,296 --> 01:22:03,904
You know you're in trouble when Alex starts ends with this

1770
01:22:04,928 --> 01:22:08,000
Clearly when there's bars a million dying which is already starting to happen

1771
01:22:08,512 --> 01:22:14,144
They're all going to go to prison they're all going to get destroyed unless they know something even bigger coming

1772
01:22:23,104 --> 01:22:26,176
Add a magnitude much bigger than this you agree

1773
01:22:28,224 --> 01:22:34,368
The most likely scenario to primary scenarios what I think's going to happen I'm sure both of them would you hear the first one

1774
01:22:34,880 --> 01:22:35,392
Talk about

1775
01:22:35,904 --> 01:22:36,416
Fastbreak

1776
01:22:36,672 --> 01:22:38,720
Where they're going to engineer a

1777
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:40,512
Collapse

1778
01:22:41,024 --> 01:22:42,560
Freezing of the entire global

1779
01:22:42,816 --> 01:22:43,584
King system

1780
01:22:43,840 --> 01:22:44,608
All transactions

1781
01:22:44,864 --> 01:22:45,376
Frozen

1782
01:22:45,888 --> 01:22:46,656
And then

1783
01:22:47,168 --> 01:22:47,680
Where's the dollar

1784
01:22:48,192 --> 01:22:50,752
Watching and then this will unleash

1785
01:22:51,776 --> 01:22:52,800
Which would justify

1786
01:22:56,384 --> 01:22:57,152
To come into the United

1787
01:22:57,408 --> 01:22:59,200
Actually, he's Chinese troops

1788
01:22:59,456 --> 01:23:01,248
Under the UN Banner you are

1789
01:23:01,760 --> 01:23:02,528
Humanitarian

1790
01:23:02,784 --> 01:23:03,296
Emissions

1791
01:23:04,576 --> 01:23:07,392
Scenario 1

1792
01:23:07,648 --> 01:23:08,160
Executions

1793
01:23:08,672 --> 01:23:10,464
AB concentration camps mass murder

1794
01:23:10,976 --> 01:23:11,488
That's even

1795
01:23:11,744 --> 01:23:13,536
For those who survived the vaccine

1796
01:23:14,560 --> 01:23:15,840
Okay so that's

1797
01:23:16,864 --> 01:23:17,632
Option one

1798
01:23:17,888 --> 01:23:18,656
Wow

1799
01:23:18,912 --> 01:23:19,424
Let's Be Cops

1800
01:23:20,192 --> 01:23:20,704
Sure

1801
01:23:21,728 --> 01:23:23,008
Collapse of the dollar

1802
01:23:23,264 --> 01:23:29,408
Troops under the the the guise of you of any folks

1803
01:23:29,664 --> 01:23:30,432
Execution

1804
01:23:31,200 --> 01:23:33,760
Tina this is also point out that if

1805
01:23:34,016 --> 01:23:35,552
We Believe other things Alexei

1806
01:23:35,808 --> 01:23:40,416
5/6 of your immune system will also be wiped out everyone will basically

1807
01:23:40,928 --> 01:23:41,952
Be dead

1808
01:23:42,464 --> 01:23:43,232
I don't know

1809
01:23:47,840 --> 01:23:49,376
Probably trying to

1810
01:23:49,632 --> 01:23:50,656
Spin a few too many play

1811
01:23:50,912 --> 01:23:57,056
The thing of the thing about it is isn't it like you do I get if you're listening to the show and sometimes you see a coincidence

1812
01:23:57,312 --> 01:24:00,384
Playing in the Twisted in your like maybe Alex is right about the

1813
01:24:00,640 --> 01:24:01,920
This sometimes or something like that

1814
01:24:02,176 --> 01:24:04,992
But if you're listening the show would you hear that why aren't you just like

1815
01:24:05,248 --> 01:24:07,040
What the f*** are you talking about

1816
01:24:07,808 --> 01:24:08,576
What cuz the cuz

1817
01:24:08,832 --> 01:24:13,440
Horse from any contact you don't need any contacts for you to just listen to that and go

1818
01:24:13,696 --> 01:24:15,232
That doesn't make sense

1819
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:21,120
. even in my conspiracy world and Jordan what if I were to tell you that that clip I just played

1820
01:24:21,376 --> 01:24:22,912
From Mike was 5 years old

1821
01:24:23,936 --> 01:24:24,448
Same thing

1822
01:24:31,360 --> 01:24:37,504
I would not know it's from this episode.

1823
01:24:37,760 --> 01:24:40,320
Things all the time

1824
01:24:40,576 --> 01:24:43,392
When you said what if I told you was 5 years ago my first thought was

1825
01:24:44,416 --> 01:24:44,928
That makes sense

1826
01:24:47,232 --> 01:24:50,816
Dammit Daniel

1827
01:24:51,072 --> 01:24:53,888
It would not be impossible

1828
01:24:54,144 --> 01:24:56,448
Select the first scenario scenario

1829
01:24:56,960 --> 01:24:58,496
Is a little bit underwhelming

1830
01:24:58,752 --> 01:25:00,288
When that's the first scenario

1831
01:25:01,056 --> 01:25:02,336
A second scenario

1832
01:25:02,848 --> 01:25:04,896
Remember this is a very Dynamic situation this

1833
01:25:05,152 --> 01:25:06,176
Also play out

1834
01:25:06,944 --> 01:25:07,456
Is that

1835
01:25:08,992 --> 01:25:09,760
Gearing up

1836
01:25:10,272 --> 01:25:11,040
2

1837
01:25:12,064 --> 01:25:12,832
Flip the script

1838
01:25:13,088 --> 01:25:13,600
And say

1839
01:25:13,856 --> 01:25:14,368
Oh my God

1840
01:25:14,880 --> 01:25:15,392
These are true

1841
01:25:15,904 --> 01:25:17,440
Vaccines that are killing everybody

1842
01:25:17,952 --> 01:25:19,744
Trump operation warp speed

1843
01:25:20,256 --> 01:25:21,024
Push

1844
01:25:22,304 --> 01:25:24,864
Pharmaceutical companies

1845
01:25:25,120 --> 01:25:27,936
He puts the FDA in the CDC for emergency authorization

1846
01:25:28,960 --> 01:25:29,472
Going to say

1847
01:25:29,984 --> 01:25:31,008
Trump's a mess

1848
01:25:31,264 --> 01:25:32,288
Killer

1849
01:25:32,544 --> 01:25:33,056
From the vaccines

1850
01:25:33,312 --> 01:25:36,128
But the rest

1851
01:25:36,384 --> 01:25:37,152
Watching it

1852
01:25:37,408 --> 01:25:39,456
Lego future ex-wife saying don't trust him

1853
01:25:39,712 --> 01:25:40,224
Yep

1854
01:25:40,736 --> 01:25:43,040
Exactly but he was lying all the time

1855
01:25:43,808 --> 01:25:47,136
This is making the other scenarios at 80%

1856
01:25:47,648 --> 01:25:48,672
Scenario

1857
01:25:48,928 --> 01:25:50,720
They are trying to then save

1858
01:25:50,976 --> 01:25:54,048
Vaccine industry

1859
01:25:54,816 --> 01:25:55,584
Play the CDC by

1860
01:25:55,840 --> 01:25:56,864
By turning against Trump

1861
01:25:57,120 --> 01:25:58,400
I'm putting all the blame on Trump

1862
01:25:58,656 --> 01:26:00,960
Again this is that same a narcissism like this month

1863
01:26:01,216 --> 01:26:02,240
Must be about my hero

1864
01:26:02,752 --> 01:26:03,264
Wow

1865
01:26:03,520 --> 01:26:05,056
I hate Trump as much as the neck

1866
01:26:05,312 --> 01:26:06,080
Text person

1867
01:26:06,592 --> 01:26:07,104
Probably

1868
01:26:07,872 --> 01:26:09,408
Maybe a little bit over average

1869
01:26:11,456 --> 01:26:14,016
I think that it would be ludicrous

1870
01:26:14,528 --> 01:26:18,368
To imagine people blaming any problems with the vaccine on Trump

1871
01:26:19,392 --> 01:26:21,952
To imagine that he had any direct

1872
01:26:22,208 --> 01:26:24,256
Involvement with the medical

1873
01:26:25,536 --> 01:26:26,816
Outside of doing things

1874
01:26:27,072 --> 01:26:28,352
That he should have done

1875
01:26:28,608 --> 01:26:29,632
Like

1876
01:26:29,888 --> 01:26:30,656
Benno buying

1877
01:26:31,168 --> 01:26:34,240
Surplus about to vaccines in order to make sure

1878
01:26:34,496 --> 01:26:35,776
That they would become available

1879
01:26:36,032 --> 01:26:38,336
The expedited process isn't

1880
01:26:38,592 --> 01:26:41,408
Things like that probably should have done more but

1881
01:26:41,664 --> 01:26:44,480
Gordon liquid imagine that there is something that

1882
01:26:44,736 --> 01:26:45,504
Comes about that is a

1883
01:26:45,760 --> 01:26:46,272
Expect

1884
01:26:46,528 --> 01:26:47,040
Consequence

1885
01:26:48,320 --> 01:26:49,856
The unforeseen

1886
01:26:50,880 --> 01:26:51,392
I don't

1887
01:26:51,648 --> 01:26:52,416
Think that anybody

1888
01:26:52,672 --> 01:26:53,952
In the right mind would blame

1889
01:26:54,720 --> 01:26:55,232
No

1890
01:26:58,560 --> 01:27:00,352
That would be a fundamental

1891
01:27:00,864 --> 01:27:02,656
Lack of understanding of

1892
01:27:02,912 --> 01:27:03,424
Let's say

1893
01:27:03,680 --> 01:27:04,192
Cause of death

1894
01:27:04,704 --> 01:27:05,216
Sure

1895
01:27:06,496 --> 01:27:09,568
I know a guy with a lot of examples

1896
01:27:09,824 --> 01:27:13,920
Might clear that up

1897
01:27:14,432 --> 01:27:15,712
First scenario is kind of fun

1898
01:27:15,968 --> 01:27:16,480
On Thursday

1899
01:27:16,736 --> 01:27:19,552
Dunno door-to-door executions as its Financial collapse

1900
01:27:20,064 --> 01:27:22,880
Sure. We could use the Alex in this but I'll let it go

1901
01:27:23,392 --> 01:27:24,160
Xcite Hotel

1902
01:27:24,416 --> 01:27:25,696
What's Argon

1903
01:27:25,952 --> 01:27:28,256
Definitely be still in play if we're going door-to-door

1904
01:27:30,048 --> 01:27:32,096
There is an excitement

1905
01:27:32,352 --> 01:27:33,120
Into this

1906
01:27:33,632 --> 01:27:36,960
In terms of like a sci-fi movie plot should I enjoy it

1907
01:27:38,240 --> 01:27:39,008
It'd be bleak

1908
01:27:39,776 --> 01:27:40,544
B shot

1909
01:27:40,800 --> 01:27:41,312
It's dark

1910
01:27:41,568 --> 01:27:45,152
Cormac McCarthy could write everybody would be dirty

1911
01:27:45,664 --> 01:27:47,200
Might get nominated

1912
01:27:48,480 --> 01:27:50,016
The second scenario

1913
01:27:54,112 --> 01:27:55,136
Trying to save

1914
01:27:55,392 --> 01:27:55,904
Science

1915
01:27:56,416 --> 01:27:59,488
By blaming the vaccines failures on

1916
01:27:59,744 --> 01:28:00,512
Trump

1917
01:28:00,768 --> 01:28:06,144
Trump was mixing up the vaccine with a spoon

1918
01:28:06,400 --> 01:28:07,680
Borderline Trump was

1919
01:28:07,936 --> 01:28:14,080
Going to view the factory where they make the vaccine and he like elbow something stuck up to a giant f****** sister beans

1920
01:28:14,336 --> 01:28:18,176
About

1921
01:28:20,224 --> 01:28:25,344
I just think this is what a kid would say

1922
01:28:25,600 --> 01:28:26,880
This is so stupid

1923
01:28:27,136 --> 01:28:28,672
It's so sad

1924
01:28:29,184 --> 01:28:30,464
It's so sad that you acted

1925
01:28:31,232 --> 01:28:32,768
It's on it's unfair

1926
01:28:33,024 --> 01:28:33,792
For me

1927
01:28:34,304 --> 01:28:37,120
And it's unfair for them like the imbalance of

1928
01:28:37,376 --> 01:28:40,192
Ability to interact with reality

1929
01:28:40,704 --> 01:28:43,008
Ezion fair you know like it's it's

1930
01:28:43,264 --> 01:28:47,360
It's a privilege in some ways to just be able to go outside and see

1931
01:28:47,616 --> 01:28:48,128
Look

1932
01:28:48,384 --> 01:28:49,152
There is a street

1933
01:28:49,408 --> 01:28:50,944
That's what it looks like and that's what it is

1934
01:28:51,200 --> 01:28:52,224
And they don't have that

1935
01:28:54,016 --> 01:28:56,576
Did Street probably hate Trump

1936
01:28:57,344 --> 01:28:58,368
Ligature

1937
01:28:58,880 --> 01:28:59,648
Get it

1938
01:29:00,672 --> 01:29:01,440
Sad

1939
01:29:01,696 --> 01:29:04,000
But we have our own sort of

1940
01:29:04,256 --> 01:29:04,768
Things we need to

1941
01:29:05,280 --> 01:29:05,792
Concerned about

1942
01:29:06,048 --> 01:29:07,328
Family that we live

1943
01:29:08,352 --> 01:29:09,376
City

1944
01:29:09,632 --> 01:29:12,192
Every major city in America what's this

1945
01:29:12,704 --> 01:29:13,728
Top picks in every city

1946
01:29:14,240 --> 01:29:15,264
Becomes a death

1947
01:29:15,776 --> 01:29:16,288
Zone

1948
01:29:16,544 --> 01:29:17,312
A war zone

1949
01:29:17,568 --> 01:29:20,128
Wallace chaos looting rate

1950
01:29:20,896 --> 01:29:21,664
Sandy that you can

1951
01:29:22,176 --> 01:29:23,968
They will be unsurvivable

1952
01:29:25,248 --> 01:29:28,320
If you're not bugged out of the city already or if you don't have a

1953
01:29:28,832 --> 01:29:30,112
Before this happened

1954
01:29:30,880 --> 01:29:31,904
It will become your tomb

1955
01:29:32,160 --> 01:29:34,208
And this city is going to be your tomb

1956
01:29:35,232 --> 01:29:35,744
Every time

1957
01:29:36,000 --> 01:29:36,512
Every time

1958
01:29:36,768 --> 01:29:37,536
Every time

1959
01:29:38,048 --> 01:29:38,560
He says

1960
01:29:38,816 --> 01:29:39,328
Every major

1961
01:29:39,584 --> 01:29:40,608
Every time

1962
01:29:40,864 --> 01:29:41,632
I mean it's

1963
01:29:42,144 --> 01:29:44,192
Everything that is going to happen

1964
01:29:44,448 --> 01:29:45,728
Will eventually lead to

1965
01:29:45,984 --> 01:29:48,032
Every major city Willock

1966
01:29:48,288 --> 01:29:48,800
Explode

1967
01:29:49,568 --> 01:29:50,848
At no point in time

1968
01:29:51,104 --> 01:29:52,384
I know playing time have these

1969
01:29:52,896 --> 01:29:53,664
Stiffy cities exploded

1970
01:29:54,432 --> 01:29:55,456
Now they just keep going

1971
01:29:55,712 --> 01:29:58,016
And sometimes their pockets of unrest

1972
01:29:58,272 --> 01:29:59,040
What happened with it

1973
01:29:59,296 --> 01:30:00,064
10 cities around

1974
01:30:00,576 --> 01:30:01,856
Particularly

1975
01:30:02,112 --> 01:30:05,696
Resident event but the cities don't end up

1976
01:30:05,952 --> 01:30:08,000
Becoming everyone

1977
01:30:08,256 --> 01:30:08,768
Cool Math

1978
01:30:09,280 --> 01:30:14,912
Or whatever I'll give you a good reason why

1979
01:30:15,168 --> 01:30:18,496
Everybody lives here so we don't want to burn it down

1980
01:30:20,032 --> 01:30:22,848
That is a piece of it I think

1981
01:30:26,688 --> 01:30:29,504
I don't really fully understand exactly what

1982
01:30:29,760 --> 01:30:30,272
This obsession

1983
01:30:30,528 --> 01:30:31,040
Comes from

1984
01:30:31,296 --> 01:30:35,904
This desire to f*** with people and make him leave cities like I don't know if it's

1985
01:30:36,160 --> 01:30:37,184
It's trying to like

1986
01:30:37,440 --> 01:30:38,720
Like if it's a long con

1987
01:30:38,976 --> 01:30:40,768
To try and get more population

1988
01:30:41,024 --> 01:30:43,072
Into rural areas

1989
01:30:43,584 --> 01:30:45,120
Greece representation

1990
01:30:45,632 --> 01:30:46,144
In the house

1991
01:30:47,168 --> 01:30:50,752
I don't know but I think it's just I think it's just that

1992
01:30:51,520 --> 01:30:52,032
Cities

1993
01:30:52,544 --> 01:30:53,312
AR

1994
01:30:53,568 --> 01:30:54,592
Less homogenized

1995
01:30:54,848 --> 01:30:55,360
Then

1996
01:30:55,616 --> 01:31:01,760
Rural communities let's just more than your head then it is actual advise anyone to actually leave the

1997
01:31:02,016 --> 01:31:03,552
The city he just wants the people he's talk

1998
01:31:03,808 --> 01:31:05,600
Can do who don't live in cities to look at

1999
01:31:05,856 --> 01:31:07,904
Cities as if they were deathtraps exactly

2000
01:31:08,160 --> 01:31:10,208
Play because they're not

2001
01:31:10,464 --> 01:31:11,488
But not all white

2002
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:13,280
Yes I do

2003
01:31:13,536 --> 01:31:16,352
Really do believe that those there probably is a bit of that

2004
01:31:16,608 --> 01:31:22,240
Because every and growing up in rural Illinois to extremely religious parents is like

2005
01:31:22,752 --> 01:31:25,056
You get the constant drumbeat

2006
01:31:25,312 --> 01:31:29,408
Be of stories of people who went away to college you went away to the city

2007
01:31:29,664 --> 01:31:32,224
Come back and they have all these different ID

2008
01:31:32,480 --> 01:31:33,248
Ideas and stuff

2009
01:31:33,504 --> 01:31:34,272
And that's just

2010
01:31:34,528 --> 01:31:35,296
Because they meet

2011
01:31:35,552 --> 01:31:36,576
Non-white people

2012
01:31:37,344 --> 01:31:41,952
Give me people who aren't the same as them and they go oh you're still people cities are a

2013
01:31:42,208 --> 01:31:42,720
Visitation

2014
01:31:42,976 --> 01:31:45,024
Of looking at people who are different from you

2015
01:31:45,536 --> 01:31:46,048
And calling them

2016
01:31:47,072 --> 01:31:50,400
Your neighbor

2017
01:31:50,656 --> 01:31:52,960
Life experience or even just different ideas

2018
01:31:53,216 --> 01:31:54,752
As your peers and

2019
01:31:55,008 --> 01:31:55,520
Equals

2020
01:31:56,032 --> 01:31:56,800
Yeah yeah

2021
01:31:57,568 --> 01:31:58,592
Better is a piece of that

2022
01:31:58,848 --> 01:32:02,176
So Micah goes on his merry way and

2023
01:32:03,456 --> 01:32:03,968
I mean look

2024
01:32:04,224 --> 01:32:05,504
It wasn't his best outing

2025
01:32:06,016 --> 01:32:07,040
But I honestly think

2026
01:32:07,296 --> 01:32:09,600
The realization that I had of like

2027
01:32:09,856 --> 01:32:11,136
You guys actually are friends

2028
01:32:11,392 --> 01:32:12,416
I think that's fun

2029
01:32:15,232 --> 01:32:18,560
The juxtaposition of those two scenarios is unacceptable

2030
01:32:19,584 --> 01:32:24,192
It sucks it does seem like one of them he put all of his eggs in one basket

2031
01:32:24,448 --> 01:32:26,240
The other one was very under-baked

2032
01:32:26,496 --> 01:32:30,336
Yeah it's like somebody who's like all right I got to pitch meeting in the morning

2033
01:32:30,848 --> 01:32:32,896
Nothing up all night getting this elaborate

2034
01:32:33,152 --> 01:32:35,200
Plot for one at Main.

2035
01:32:35,712 --> 01:32:36,736
Is it going

2036
01:32:36,992 --> 01:32:38,528
Half an hour laying out this

2037
01:32:38,784 --> 01:32:41,600
Detailed scenario on the second one

2038
01:32:42,112 --> 01:32:46,464
Guy falls in love actually going to pick up that one

2039
01:32:47,744 --> 01:32:49,792
Little disappointed you kind of

2040
01:32:50,048 --> 01:32:50,816
UE

2041
01:32:51,072 --> 01:32:53,120
You know maybe we were going to pass on the

2042
01:32:53,376 --> 01:32:57,216
Second one anyways but now I think we're going to pass on both. Get out of here like

2043
01:32:57,472 --> 01:33:00,800
Alex talks about the people who got the first

2044
01:33:01,056 --> 01:33:01,568
People who got the

2045
01:33:01,824 --> 01:33:02,336
Pfizer shot

2046
01:33:02,592 --> 01:33:03,360
He might be wrong about

2047
01:33:09,760 --> 01:33:11,808
Call screen

2048
01:33:12,064 --> 01:33:13,600
Watching them snuff

2049
01:33:16,160 --> 01:33:16,672
Oh my God

2050
01:33:18,464 --> 01:33:23,584
The first person who got 250 shot

2051
01:33:24,608 --> 01:33:25,888
The first man

2052
01:33:26,656 --> 01:33:28,192
Okay you know you did say that

2053
01:33:28,448 --> 01:33:31,008
The first man to get the Pfizer shot you know what his name was

2054
01:33:31,520 --> 01:33:32,800
William Shakespeare

2055
01:33:33,824 --> 01:33:39,968
I wish I was making that up that's really was Bill Shakespeare in the UK

2056
01:33:40,224 --> 01:33:43,296
Swear to you I would have turned him away

2057
01:33:43,552 --> 01:33:44,064
Could be the first

2058
01:33:44,320 --> 01:33:45,600
You can be number two

2059
01:33:45,856 --> 01:33:50,720
This is not we're not going down in history as Bill Shakespeare being the first to get that f****** back safe

2060
01:33:50,976 --> 01:33:55,072
The conspiracy theorists have a field day with us

2061
01:33:55,328 --> 01:33:58,144
This was last December and he did not die of month later

2062
01:33:58,400 --> 01:34:01,728
He passed away in May of this year of an unrelated Illinois

2063
01:34:02,496 --> 01:34:07,872
How to dress fudging the details of this stuff because he knows that the reality these stories isn't salacious enough to justify his abs

2064
01:34:08,128 --> 01:34:08,896
Search injectors

2065
01:34:09,664 --> 01:34:10,176
Calling this

2066
01:34:10,944 --> 01:34:11,456
I f******

2067
01:34:11,712 --> 01:34:12,224
Snuff film

2068
01:34:13,760 --> 01:34:14,528
Ridiculous

2069
01:34:14,784 --> 01:34:18,624
Course the first people to get the vaccine we're also the ones

2070
01:34:18,880 --> 01:34:19,904
Closest to dying

2071
01:34:20,160 --> 01:34:20,672
Anyway

2072
01:34:20,928 --> 01:34:25,536
I read about his passing away

2073
01:34:25,792 --> 01:34:26,560
It was one of

2074
01:34:26,816 --> 01:34:30,400
He was incredibly proud of being able to be a part of

2075
01:34:30,656 --> 01:34:33,728
And it's just a real tragedy to see

2076
01:34:33,984 --> 01:34:34,752
Granted Alex

2077
01:34:35,008 --> 01:34:36,800
Know his name but he's not really piss merch

2078
01:34:37,824 --> 01:34:38,336
His memory

2079
01:34:38,592 --> 01:34:40,128
That much prettiest still using his death

2080
01:34:40,384 --> 01:34:45,248
That's gross he's exploiting somebody who who really believed that what they were doing is right

2081
01:34:47,296 --> 01:34:49,344
You're one last clip years has Alex decides

2082
01:34:49,600 --> 01:34:50,368
The end the show

2083
01:34:51,904 --> 01:34:52,416
Again

2084
01:34:52,672 --> 01:34:53,184
Brick

2085
01:34:53,696 --> 01:34:54,464
Through the computer

2086
01:34:55,232 --> 01:34:59,584
Sunday live in the ocean until Sunday but Sunday lights the next 2 hours

2087
01:35:00,096 --> 01:35:01,632
I'ma come back and play all those.

2088
01:35:01,888 --> 01:35:02,400
Collapse

2089
01:35:02,912 --> 01:35:04,960
Medical Dean

2090
01:35:05,984 --> 01:35:08,032
You were coming I'm single shots on safe

2091
01:35:08,800 --> 01:35:11,872
This is big

2092
01:35:15,456 --> 01:35:15,968
After Club

2093
01:35:16,480 --> 01:35:19,040
F*** you

2094
01:35:20,320 --> 01:35:26,464
Actually Jordan we've run out of time we are going to talk about those clips that I was played on the other show but we're going to

2095
01:35:26,720 --> 01:35:32,096
Have to do it another bill actually you

2096
01:35:32,352 --> 01:35:33,888
Spent so much time with those clips

2097
01:35:34,400 --> 01:35:34,912
That you have

2098
01:35:35,168 --> 01:35:36,960
Too much information to impart

2099
01:35:37,472 --> 01:35:40,288
How are you

2100
01:35:41,056 --> 01:35:42,848
Facebook

2101
01:35:44,384 --> 01:35:46,432
So transparent

2102
01:35:46,688 --> 01:35:49,504
It's legitimately so

2103
01:35:49,760 --> 01:35:51,040
Embarrassingly

2104
01:35:51,296 --> 01:35:52,064
Clear what he's doing

2105
01:35:52,576 --> 01:35:54,624
And it is like okay there is a sea

2106
01:35:54,880 --> 01:35:56,928
Sensational headline that I'm going to

2107
01:35:57,184 --> 01:35:58,464
Teased throughout the show

2108
01:35:58,720 --> 01:35:59,744
That is broadcast on

2109
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:01,024
Some radio station

2110
01:36:01,280 --> 01:36:07,424
In order to actually cover the story or whatever I'm going to force people to get it on my own platform

2111
01:36:07,936 --> 01:36:08,960
8 some of this away from

2112
01:36:10,752 --> 01:36:11,264
My own

2113
01:36:11,520 --> 01:36:12,288
Market

2114
01:36:12,544 --> 01:36:15,360
Or maybe part of that I don't know if it is necessarily but like

2115
01:36:16,896 --> 01:36:22,528
I did notice when I went to his website but there is a lot more my pillow ads on the other website

2116
01:36:22,784 --> 01:36:26,624
Maybe maybe not on radio shows

2117
01:36:27,136 --> 01:36:30,464
But on a on his website Mike lindell's seems to be getting

2118
01:36:30,720 --> 01:36:31,488
Involved

2119
01:36:32,000 --> 01:36:32,512
And advertise

2120
01:36:33,024 --> 01:36:34,304
Oh man that's like him

2121
01:36:35,584 --> 01:36:36,096
Okay

2122
01:36:36,352 --> 01:36:39,424
I got this clip that's going to prove everything over to say Ed brother

2123
01:36:39,680 --> 01:36:40,704
All right and then

2124
01:36:52,736 --> 01:36:54,272
You you want to hear it okay

2125
01:36:54,528 --> 01:36:55,040
Petco Coco

2126
01:36:58,880 --> 01:36:59,648
I don't have to do it but

2127
01:37:00,672 --> 01:37:01,184
Yeah

2128
01:37:03,232 --> 01:37:04,512
Really really frustrated

2129
01:37:05,024 --> 01:37:05,792
And I hate it

2130
01:37:06,048 --> 01:37:07,840
Every scene the strategy

2131
01:37:08,096 --> 01:37:08,864
Play out like

2132
01:37:09,120 --> 01:37:09,632
A bit

2133
01:37:10,400 --> 01:37:15,776
This this this weird like the other show

2134
01:37:16,800 --> 01:37:18,592
That's so annoying. I hate it

2135
01:37:19,104 --> 01:37:21,920
So you know this episode was was

2136
01:37:22,176 --> 01:37:23,200
Was real dumb

2137
01:37:23,456 --> 01:37:23,968
You mean like

2138
01:37:24,736 --> 01:37:26,784
One of the things I find very fascinating is the

2139
01:37:27,296 --> 01:37:27,808
This

2140
01:37:28,576 --> 01:37:29,088
Idea

2141
01:37:29,856 --> 01:37:30,880
That Alex had

2142
01:37:31,392 --> 01:37:32,160
First of all done

2143
01:37:32,416 --> 01:37:33,696
6 hours of research

2144
01:37:33,952 --> 01:37:37,024
And somehow got dizzy because he had so much

2145
01:37:37,280 --> 01:37:38,560
Information or whatever

2146
01:37:38,816 --> 01:37:40,864
Any gets on Aaron one of the primary sources

2147
01:37:41,120 --> 01:37:41,632
Diseases is a

2148
01:37:43,424 --> 01:37:45,472
Thumbs down time to find that tweet though

2149
01:37:45,728 --> 01:37:46,752
Thumbs down

2150
01:37:47,776 --> 01:37:49,312
Even did

2151
01:37:50,336 --> 01:37:50,848
20 minute

2152
01:37:51,616 --> 01:37:56,480
Of preparation for the show he could have found the underlying report that tweet was referencing

2153
01:37:56,736 --> 01:38:00,064
And not been a guy who's reporting on a tweet it would not have been her

2154
01:38:00,320 --> 01:38:03,392
That would have been probably the thing that anybody would do take care

2155
01:38:03,648 --> 01:38:04,160
Anybody

2156
01:38:05,440 --> 01:38:06,464
And then he talks to me

2157
01:38:06,720 --> 01:38:07,232
Mike Adams

2158
01:38:07,744 --> 01:38:08,768
About bulshit

2159
01:38:09,024 --> 01:38:09,536
Forever but they

2160
01:38:09,792 --> 01:38:10,304
Phone

2161
01:38:10,560 --> 01:38:12,352
He's talking to that weirdo from Canada

2162
01:38:12,608 --> 01:38:15,680
Who wanted to start a weird school should he doesn't talk about the Weird School

2163
01:38:15,936 --> 01:38:18,496
He doesn't have time to get to Spanish

2164
01:38:18,752 --> 01:38:20,544
I'm sorry I was having fun

2165
01:38:20,800 --> 01:38:22,080
Riffin with my buddy

2166
01:38:22,592 --> 01:38:24,640
About imaginary scenarios that

2167
01:38:24,896 --> 01:38:25,664
Can't happen.

2168
01:38:25,920 --> 01:38:28,992
It's just unacceptable if you imagine

2169
01:38:29,248 --> 01:38:30,528
That he's serious about us

2170
01:38:31,552 --> 01:38:32,320
Like if you ask

2171
01:38:32,576 --> 01:38:36,672
Actually think that he thinks there's value in getting these stories to people

2172
01:38:37,184 --> 01:38:38,208
This is

2173
01:38:38,464 --> 01:38:39,232
Nonsensical

2174
01:38:39,488 --> 01:38:42,304
But on the other hand if you recognize that

2175
01:38:42,560 --> 01:38:46,144
He knows that the entertainment value was having like Adam scare people right

2176
01:38:46,400 --> 01:38:49,984
Then you kind of get the like o this is what Drive sales as opposed to

2177
01:38:50,752 --> 01:38:52,288
People being disappointed by

2178
01:38:52,544 --> 01:38:54,336
New stories not living up to the way your t

2179
01:38:56,128 --> 01:38:57,408
It's it's him not

2180
01:38:57,664 --> 01:38:58,432
You know it's like

2181
01:38:59,456 --> 01:39:00,480
In the

2182
01:39:01,504 --> 01:39:02,528
The way we view it

2183
01:39:02,784 --> 01:39:04,576
If you cared about your show

2184
01:39:05,088 --> 01:39:05,600
Then you would

2185
01:39:05,856 --> 01:39:07,136
Take the things that you say

2186
01:39:07,392 --> 01:39:08,160
Evan

2187
01:39:08,928 --> 01:39:11,232
If you cared about your joke that would work on it

2188
01:39:11,488 --> 01:39:16,608
You would prepare for it you would make sure things sounded good you would get a staff that can

2189
01:39:16,864 --> 01:39:17,376
F******

2190
01:39:17,632 --> 01:39:21,984
Keep your phone calls on are all of those things I would honestly suggest that if Alex

2191
01:39:22,496 --> 01:39:24,800
Approve the things that he claims he could prove

2192
01:39:25,568 --> 01:39:27,360
He has a moral response

2193
01:39:27,616 --> 01:39:28,128
Possibility

2194
01:39:28,384 --> 01:39:28,896
To do his job

2195
01:39:29,408 --> 01:39:29,920
Like you do

2196
01:39:30,176 --> 01:39:31,200
Just have like

2197
01:39:31,712 --> 01:39:33,760
Of the financial incentives

2198
01:39:34,016 --> 01:39:35,040
It is a n

2199
01:39:35,296 --> 01:39:35,808
Imperative

2200
01:39:36,320 --> 01:39:36,832
But he do it

2201
01:39:37,088 --> 01:39:38,112
If you can't

2202
01:39:38,624 --> 01:39:39,392
And he doesn't

2203
01:39:39,904 --> 01:39:40,672
Auntie

2204
01:39:41,440 --> 01:39:43,488
Here's the bigger here's the biggest

2205
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:44,512
Alright

2206
01:39:45,024 --> 01:39:45,792
Because he can't

2207
01:39:46,048 --> 01:39:47,584
Won't and lies about it

2208
01:39:47,840 --> 01:39:48,352
Right

2209
01:39:48,608 --> 01:39:51,424
Then it becomes our moral imperative to f******

2210
01:39:51,680 --> 01:39:55,264
Talk about it he's making us work for him that's what it happening

2211
01:39:57,824 --> 01:39:58,848
Open system of morality

2212
01:40:00,128 --> 01:40:01,408
Because we think about it that way

2213
01:40:02,176 --> 01:40:05,248
It's nice to have a boss again

2214
01:40:08,832 --> 01:40:10,880
I feel a little bit Rusty

2215
01:40:11,136 --> 01:40:17,280
See this time visible longest time we've gone without recording an episode or seeing each other for a while

2216
01:40:17,536 --> 01:40:23,680
I feel like I'm a little off my game I'm excited for next episode of think we'll be a little bit more in the groove

2217
01:40:24,448 --> 01:40:24,960
A little bit

2218
01:40:27,264 --> 01:40:31,104
Feeling happy is good to do the show it's good to get back home for sure

2219
01:40:36,224 --> 01:40:38,272
Absolutely it's one of those things

2220
01:40:39,040 --> 01:40:39,552
Man

2221
01:40:40,064 --> 01:40:42,880
Vacations great but when you really love what you do

2222
01:40:43,136 --> 01:40:44,416
God if you miss work

2223
01:40:44,672 --> 01:40:45,696
Weird

2224
01:40:46,208 --> 01:40:46,720
I mean.

2225
01:40:46,976 --> 01:40:48,000
It's because I don't do much

2226
01:40:51,328 --> 01:40:55,680
I can't wait to get back to the office where I do nothing

2227
01:40:56,704 --> 01:40:57,216
Hey

2228
01:40:57,472 --> 01:41:00,800
When you get a good job you can't be jealous of it real

2229
01:41:01,824 --> 01:41:03,872
Oh you're going to kill me now

2230
01:41:04,128 --> 01:41:06,944
Where will be back

2231
01:41:07,712 --> 01:41:08,992
Back on Friday

2232
01:41:10,528 --> 01:41:13,088
We do have a website about right.

2233
01:41:13,344 --> 01:41:16,672
We are on Twitter that knowledge underscore fight and I go to bed Jordan

2234
01:41:16,928 --> 01:41:20,000
We are

2235
01:41:20,256 --> 01:41:22,560
Local charity or bail Fund in your area to help out people

2236
01:41:22,816 --> 01:41:23,328
Doing God's work

2237
01:41:27,680 --> 01:41:29,472
I am emotionally unbalanced

2238
01:41:29,728 --> 01:41:31,008
Stand Moody General Patton

2239
01:41:31,264 --> 01:41:33,312
Giving a very wishy-washy speech

2240
01:41:38,176 --> 01:41:38,944
Alex

2241
01:41:39,200 --> 01:41:41,760
Birthstone colors
