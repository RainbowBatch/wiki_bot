Air Jordan

00:00:21,504 --> 00:00:27,648

00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,632
Jordan

10
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:12,960
Interesting

11
00:01:13,216 --> 00:01:14,240
Little videos

12
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:18,080
YouTube that I think is really great and I've enjoyed quite a bit

13
00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:21,152
There's this Timber on toast

14
00:01:21,408 --> 00:01:23,456

15
00:01:23,712 --> 00:01:26,528
First heard of them or a person

00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,576
Through the majority report

17
00:01:28,832 --> 00:01:31,392

18
00:01:31,648 --> 00:01:33,696
Is channel had a great breakdown of Dave Rubin

19
00:01:35,232 --> 00:01:38,816
Trends on his channel

20
00:01:39,072 --> 00:01:44,960
I think it's called Battle of ideas check out

21
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,080
All that's going on

22
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:56,224
Are out now but I'm not sure how many total there

23
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:59,296
No history.

24
00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:00,320
Veritas

25
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:03,392
It's just really well done

26
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:06,976
Quality

27
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:14,144
Videos keep your attention

28
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,424
Well done

29
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:24,128
It's a subject that I don't have the patience to read

30
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:30,016
Well done well done through

31
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:32,064
Shoutouts

32
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:36,672
Okay

33
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:40,768
First three of these

34
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:42,304
I hope

35
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:49,728
I was going to say 50 hearts in this series

36
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:51,264
Put out content

37
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:02,272

00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:04,320
When is back playing NBA

39
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:07,136
You are

40
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:14,048
You're really excited about sports

41
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:19,168
Continue at everybody

42
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:20,448
I feel like I

43
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:24,800
I have to be very cautious about celebrating your bright spot of basketball team back

44
00:03:27,104 --> 00:03:32,480
Turn out

45
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:36,832
Marlins baseball

46
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:41,952
Either cancel the season or just contracted the Marlins and just like

47
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:44,768
Wow you guys are in a franchise

48
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,424
So I'm fine with that

49
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:57,824
Jeter on who is the CEO and he's got part ownership and let me tell you something Dan if you want

50
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:04,224
Somebody to get rid of it

51
00:04:04,736 --> 00:04:08,832
Jordans

52
00:04:09,088 --> 00:04:11,392
July 28th through 30th

53
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:15,488
So here was the plan

54
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:22,655
I was aware that this Frontline special on PBS

55
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:28,543
I initially had planned that are episode 4

56
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:30,591
Discussion event Frontline episode

57
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:35,199
And then I'll look at Alex on the day before

58
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:39,295
Easy and all right

59
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:43,903
Bucked up

60
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:48,767
Of that PBS Frontline special

61
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:51,839
Is interesting and I bought to say about it

62
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:53,375
That's it

63
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:55,935
Today we're guarding us on the 30th

64
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:56,959
Thursday

65
00:04:57,215 --> 00:04:59,007
Trump tweeted in the morning

66
00:04:59,263 --> 00:05:00,799
Something to the effect

67
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:04,895
Maybe we should postpone the election

68
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:06,687
And

69
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:08,991
Obviously I can't wait for Monday

70
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:15,391
We had we got it

71
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:16,927
Episode onto the pile

72
00:05:17,183 --> 00:05:23,327
Alex is at with the president

73
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:29,727
Maybe we should just go put it on

74
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:40,735
Beastly we just do it again is fine with that

75
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:48,927
The authority to do that

76
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:52,255
Or America

77
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:57,119
Your position I'm more concerned about the

78
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:58,911
Side effects

79
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:02,495
That conversation

80
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:06,335
Fat people who follow him

81
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:08,639
The expectations surrounding

82
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:10,175
The upcoming election

83
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:16,319
Yes very much though

84
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:22,719
And we'll get to that episode when we talk about the 30th but for now

85
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:25,023
Mg42 let's

86
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:36,287
Suspended until some nebulous time in the future

87
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:48,831
Thank you

88
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:51,391
Alexandria

89
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:52,415

00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:55,743
Starbright

91
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:58,559
Are you Patrick

92
00:06:58,815 --> 00:07:01,375
Another

93
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:07,775
Daniel

94
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:12,383
I'm a policy wonk

95
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:19,295
Thanks very much Rebecca

96
00:07:22,623 --> 00:07:25,439
Colleen W thank you so much

97
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:35,423
Business

98
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:37,471
Money off that heroin

99
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:41,055
Is freakishly large

100
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:47,711
Thanks so much as a kid

101
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:54,623
Outdoor website

102
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:57,951
Beautiful

103
00:07:58,463 --> 00:07:59,999
That generosity

104
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:01,279
Cast

105
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:03,327
I passed out

106
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:04,095
No

107
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:06,655
Oak Barrel

108
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:07,679
Just a wrap

109
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:09,215
Everyone

110
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:12,799
Realizing I don't know how to age whiskey

111
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:14,847
What is trying to do

112
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:21,247
Generosity

113
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:24,063
Prepared area

114
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:29,439
I thought what I would do first

115
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:33,023
Episode he's disgusting actual Frontline

116
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,047
Pbs.org

117
00:08:35,071 --> 00:08:39,423
I thought it was pretty well done

118
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:40,703
Pretty much

119
00:08:41,215 --> 00:08:43,519
You know for people who don't know a lot about Alex

120
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:46,591
The pretty good primer about what you might call his greatest hits

121
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:52,223
There were very accurate point about his coverage of things like 9/11

122
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:56,319
Dual-fuel couple of glaring problems with the documentary that I think they're mentioned

123
00:08:57,087 --> 00:08:57,855
One of them

124
00:08:58,111 --> 00:08:59,903
Is no real conversation

125
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:01,183
About Boston bomber

126
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:06,047
And I know that maybe that's one of the pieces of his history that

127
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:07,071
I'm bored

128
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:09,631
Intimately familiar with

129
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:11,423
Looking at it

130
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:14,751
Irrelevant pieces of

131
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:19,359
Of his propaganda at the end

132
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:21,663
Chapter in his life

133
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:25,759
Maybe what you going to do

134
00:09:26,271 --> 00:09:28,831
I think there was an overly simplistic telling

135
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:31,391
Alex is transition to supporting Trump

136
00:09:31,647 --> 00:09:36,255
They kind of made it appear that Rodger Stone just showed up and then Alex supported

137
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:38,815
Real

138
00:09:39,327 --> 00:09:43,167
Flashing out of a lot of the past that there was no

139
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:50,079
Not use those clips

140
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:50,847
You

141
00:09:51,103 --> 00:09:57,247
I feel like that could

142
00:09:57,503 --> 00:10:02,879
The Trump is Mob Japanese a front man for Consortium on the East Coast

143
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:04,415
The image

144
00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:05,695
Just be presented

145
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:07,487
What's up conversation with Steve

146
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:08,767
Pieczenik at all like

147
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:10,303
A lot of these things

148
00:10:10,815 --> 00:10:11,327
Sandy Hook

149
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:15,935
Trump intersects with Steve

150
00:10:18,495 --> 00:10:20,543
Maybe that would have been too much to unpack

151
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:22,847
Possible

152
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:31,551
Weeds with a lot of

153
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:35,135
If you look at it

154
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:36,671
The simplified version of 3

155
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:39,231
I think they did a pretty good job so

156
00:10:39,743 --> 00:10:41,791
I would have maybe

157
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:44,863
It stuck out to me

158
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:49,983
Was there's one instance of misrepresentation that this documentary made

159
00:10:50,751 --> 00:10:52,543
In the passage about Alex's Sandy Hook

160
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:54,079
Conspiracies they should be roll

161
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:58,175
Infowars picture of Adam Lanza

162
00:10:58,431 --> 00:11:00,223
Playing over it was Alex

163
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:05,087
And the doctor's he was under a was an Air Force mind control doctor using

164
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:07,135
Interface program

165
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:09,439
And told people he was under mind control in the

166
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:10,207
The jail

167
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:16,863
The audio it is that's being used is Alex talking about James Holmes the Aurora movie theater shooting

168
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:18,911
It is very true that Alex

169
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:21,471
Constantly

170
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:23,775
The cast doubt on the reality

171
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:28,383
But at no point in the Frontline piece did they make clear that the audio is not

172
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:34,783
Specifically about Adam

173
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:38,879
And video

174
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:41,183
A reasonable assumption for the viewer to think

175
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:45,279
It's audio they're playing is Adam

176
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:46,047
Accurate

177
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:48,095
There's no reason for them to introduce

178
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:49,119
This kind of confusion

179
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:55,775
They could have referenced James Holmes and said that was with who Alex was talking about a different piece of audiovalve

180
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:59,359
It's actually talked about presented his kind of sloppy

181
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:02,687
I don't think it's a major misrepresentation or any

182
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:03,455
Pensive decept

183
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:08,575
But I do think it's the sort of thing that a propagandist like Alex could latch onto to invalidate the peace

184
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:13,951
If they make it look like I said

185
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:14,975
Did they misrepresent

186
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:18,303
That kind of thing.

187
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:21,375
Although I will say I think

188
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:22,911
You saying that is

189
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:24,447
The first time he will figure that

190
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:34,431
Retard to avoid playing into if I was making this documentary

191
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:41,343
The tricks that are very easy to be playing defense as your creator

192
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:47,743
Every moment and every T's crossed so this is f*****

193
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:53,375
Complaints about this documentary is interview subject

194
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:54,143
Selection

195
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:59,519
This thing is almost entirely attackable and discardable based on Mattawa

196
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:02,079
There are three categories of interviewees

197
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:03,103
Simmons documentary

198
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:06,175
The first is insightful subject

199
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:09,503
That's exactly who should be in the documentary talk

200
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:13,855
This category of the Austin American

201
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:16,415
Statesman and naked

202
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:17,951
Of the Texas month

203
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:23,071
Beautiful to a local awareness of Alex outside of his existence as a national public figure

204
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:26,143
Able to provide some earlier context in his career

205
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:30,751
Also in this group is

206
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:33,567
Of course makes sense that somebody would make me happy

207
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:35,359
He's like this

208
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:37,407
It is perspective

209
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:40,735
Father of a child killed at Sandy Hook

210
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:43,551
Is also an important voice

211
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:49,951
It's good to have him there to really make explicit and related to Alex's Behavior

212
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:54,303
Additionally Anna Berlin the author of republic

213
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:59,423
As was Morgan get me Rodger Stone

214
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:04,287
Same can be said for Nancy Rosenblum Elizabeth Williamson

215
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:07,615
Either people have an external perspective on the issues that are

216
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:11,711
The problem with Alex and they're able to offer insight

217
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:15,039
Subject matter of the documentary

218
00:14:15,295 --> 00:14:19,135
Nancy Rosenblum

219
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:20,159
She has Judge

220
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:24,767
She listens to

221
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:27,583
Are you sure

222
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:31,167
GM's the documentary with a question of whether or not we'll be able to

223
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:33,471
Return to a reasonable place of sanity

224
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:34,751
And that question

225
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:37,823
Depends on whether or not the people who end up in positions of

226
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:40,127
The power can resist the urge to use

227
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:40,895
Conspiracy

228
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:42,943
Yeah and I thought that was a really good

229
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:44,223
Perspective for what

230
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:45,503
This documentary was right

231
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:47,295
Because it really does put the folks

232
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:49,599
Play some The onus on like these things do work

233
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:51,903
Plan they work

234
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:56,255
Right and it's the responsibility and Leadership

235
00:14:56,511 --> 00:14:59,071
To not weaponize them for their own personal opinion

236
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:00,607
Because it is a short

237
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:03,679
I thought that was really

238
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:07,519
Documentary really well and II

239
00:15:07,775 --> 00:15:09,567
I thought that was a really nice thought

240
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:11,871
The second category of people

241
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:13,663
Are people who you absolutely should not

242
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:21,599
This group includes no get the f*** out of here

243
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:27,231
Call Michael

244
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:32,351
.

245
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:39,519
Barnes and Rodger kind of understandable

246
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:43,615
The opportunity to give their side of the story

247
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:47,711
She's basically just there to make it clear that she's not as bad as Infowars which only

248
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:51,807
Serves to launder her it doesn't need to be engaged

249
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:53,087
Goddamnit PBS

250
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:57,951
Now the third category is people who I understand documentary

251
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:59,487
But we're probably miss Han

252
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:01,535
These are people who create

253
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:03,071
Targets for the documentary

254
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:07,935
The unearned suspicions about The credibility of the report

255
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:11,007
This group includes Alex's ex-wife Kelly

256
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:17,407
No understand talking to her and all those solid details

257
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:21,247
About Infowars early day since she was deeply involved in the company

258
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:24,063
I don't think that you should never talk

259
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:28,159
Her anything like that but her being in this documentary at this point

260
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:33,791
Open store to Alex

261
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:34,815
You got a text

262
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:38,143
The same as you existed before merging forward

263
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:39,423
Employees that they speak to

264
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:47,615
Swimsuit complaints couple years ago

265
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:48,639
Infowars

266
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:49,407
You know

267
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:52,479
Continue to work there for 4 years after Sandy Hook

268
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:55,295
Years as an Infowars employee

269
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:59,135
Really completely fine

270
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:05,535
He's a source that is impeachable from my perspective and from Alex's

271
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:07,327
His contribution to the

272
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:08,351
Kind of point

273
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:11,167
This also extends to Josh Owen

274
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:12,191
Used to work at

275
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:15,007
Infowars

276
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:16,543
New York

277
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:21,919
I respect both of these dudes and their right to change their position and make amends for their active participation

278
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:23,967
And profiting from conspiracy

279
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:28,831
I'm not positive they're doing it in this form is helpful and I think it complicates the p

280
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:31,903
I think it I think it makes it the more difficult

281
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:34,975
So is a vowel sound watching this

282
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:37,535
I am getting from them

283
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:39,839
You know like I'm getting

284
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:42,143
A former Infowars people being like

285
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:48,543
Man evil s*** all the time but I was a good person that sometime I tried to tell a lie

286
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:53,663
Infowars.com

287
00:17:53,919 --> 00:18:00,063
I mean you could just like yours

288
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:02,879
Alex didn't mind getting on are insane

289
00:18:03,135 --> 00:18:05,183
Lies about people

290
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:09,535
Is as demonstrated by the video of him doing it as if I

291
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:11,071
This person saying that I don't

292
00:18:11,327 --> 00:18:11,839
Here

293
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:13,119
About their perspective

294
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:14,399
I don't know if

295
00:18:14,655 --> 00:18:15,679
Yeah baby yeah

296
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:18,751
Maybe I'm a little bit harsh on that front.

297
00:18:19,007 --> 00:18:22,079
Lumberjack in the Pacific

298
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:28,479
And one of the other category is building

299
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:30,527
Of Alex in the Sandy Hook

300
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:33,343
Is one of the other people who is interview

301
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:34,111
Adhere

302
00:18:34,367 --> 00:18:40,511
I don't believe that anymore.

303
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:47,679
He's interviewed a situation where

304
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:49,215
I think that the

305
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:49,983
PBS

306
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:51,775
People

307
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:53,055
No it's that is

308
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:54,079
Really though

309
00:18:55,103 --> 00:19:00,479
You didn't say anything like that I think is horrible or anything

310
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:06,623
You know how easy this is going to be for people like our

311
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:11,231
Who is deposing him

312
00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:13,279
You're speaking as an expert

313
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:19,935
He's literally part of the globalist establishment that we're all fighting against

314
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:23,263
Using his s*** that you are all part of the globalist

315
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:24,799
Butter data data data

316
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:29,407
Yeah I'm positive how much that is

317
00:19:29,663 --> 00:19:30,943
Consider like

318
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:33,247
Dim

319
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:37,855
I think that Barnes and like

320
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:39,647
Absolutely don't put them in here

321
00:19:40,415 --> 00:19:46,559
I think that these other people like the ex-employees like Kelly like this this lawyer

322
00:19:46,815 --> 00:19:47,583
Like I think

323
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:50,655
I understand why this

324
00:19:50,911 --> 00:19:51,679
Peace isn't it

325
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:53,215
Like what I would make

326
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:54,239
Sure

327
00:19:55,007 --> 00:19:56,799
So I would say that it's a

328
00:19:57,055 --> 00:20:00,895
Is it in Italy decision

329
00:20:01,151 --> 00:20:03,199
These people were presented in Waze

330
00:20:03,711 --> 00:20:05,247
That Baker

331
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:06,783
Their inclusion

332
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:09,343
Valuable

333
00:20:11,135 --> 00:20:12,671
Would have

334
00:20:12,927 --> 00:20:14,463
Perspective to give

335
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:15,487
I don't know

336
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:17,535
Let Me Pitch you a new jacket

337
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:20,095
1 in

338
00:20:22,143 --> 00:20:23,423
6 static shot

339
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:27,007
We don't even worry about any graphics or anyting black

340
00:20:27,263 --> 00:20:30,079
Background just a regular old

341
00:20:30,335 --> 00:20:31,615
Stage

342
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:35,199
Larry klayman interviewing Rodger Stone

343
00:20:35,455 --> 00:20:41,599
Traveling show I want them to do a 20-city tour

344
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:52,863
In terms of these for like general population consumption

345
00:20:54,143 --> 00:20:56,447
The decisions that they made into except for Barnes and

346
00:20:56,703 --> 00:20:57,215
Ann Coulter

347
00:20:58,751 --> 00:21:01,567
Can I watch them for these interview choices

348
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:06,175
I just wouldn't include them as I was making this because there lightning rods

349
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:10,015
Very valid

350
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:14,111
Points brought up by people like Anna Merlin and Nancy rosenblum's

351
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:18,208
Can behave like superheaven

352
00:21:18,464 --> 00:21:19,744
The former employees who have Grudge

353
00:21:20,256 --> 00:21:23,584
Chinese ex-wife was actively involved in court cases against him

354
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,632
And a lawyer

355
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:29,728
If I were making this documentary I would have created it a lot differently

356
00:21:31,008 --> 00:21:32,032
If I were making it

357
00:21:32,288 --> 00:21:33,056
It wouldn't be as good

358
00:21:33,568 --> 00:21:39,712
The goal of the documentary is to inform the public about how conspiracy theories found their way into the mainstream through the lens of a

359
00:21:39,968 --> 00:21:40,480
Alex's

360
00:21:41,504 --> 00:21:44,320
The point is accurate but some of the nuances incorrect

361
00:21:44,576 --> 00:21:47,648
But there's no way to discuss the Nuance in just an hour

362
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,440
The version I would make would be in

363
00:21:49,952 --> 00:21:50,464
Possibility

364
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,768
Probably wouldn't be digestible by y.

365
00:21:53,024 --> 00:21:59,168
I would say probably 3 episodes

366
00:22:00,192 --> 00:22:02,496
3 hours

367
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:07,872
Completely inaccessible

368
00:22:09,152 --> 00:22:10,944
CVS

369
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,736
.

370
00:22:12,992 --> 00:22:16,576
I do appreciate that some people

371
00:22:16,832 --> 00:22:19,648
Call David Jordan

372
00:22:21,184 --> 00:22:27,328
You know for not calling us 100%

373
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:30,144
I don't really think that we have

374
00:22:30,656 --> 00:22:31,168
That much

375
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:31,936
To bring

376
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:38,080
My only argument is if you have Barnes on you have to have me on his account

377
00:22:38,592 --> 00:22:39,872
That's what you have to do

378
00:22:40,128 --> 00:22:46,272
Barnes is a moron who doesn't know s*** and he's a grifter and I'm a moron he doesn't know s*** and I hate Barnes

379
00:22:46,528 --> 00:22:49,088
Speaking of which it is now eleven days

380
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:56,512
Respond to your challenge

381
00:22:56,768 --> 00:23:01,120
I'll get covid if you get covid and we'll do this s***

382
00:23:01,376 --> 00:23:02,656
To anybody

383
00:23:02,912 --> 00:23:08,544
All the way

384
00:23:10,336 --> 00:23:11,104
What's the let's do that

385
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,384
So I thought this is a

386
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,432
I'll be perfectly honest

387
00:23:14,688 --> 00:23:19,040
I thought the PBS documentary was much better than I expect

388
00:23:19,808 --> 00:23:21,600
A lot of the times these things

389
00:23:21,856 --> 00:23:23,904
Are pretty poorly

390
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:26,208
Or like kind of like sloppily.

391
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,000
Outside of that one

392
00:23:28,256 --> 00:23:31,072
Instance where they were talking about James Holmes over

393
00:23:31,328 --> 00:23:33,632
Pictures of Adam Lanza

394
00:23:33,888 --> 00:23:34,400
Anything goes like

395
00:23:34,656 --> 00:23:36,192
This is explicitly

396
00:23:37,728 --> 00:23:40,544
That's solid

397
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:44,128
I found it to be quite that good for what it set out to be

398
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:46,944
I thought it was really

399
00:23:47,456 --> 00:23:48,736
Interesting having watched

400
00:23:48,992 --> 00:23:50,528
To see this

401
00:23:51,552 --> 00:23:52,832
Couple days and Alex

402
00:23:53,856 --> 00:23:56,672
2018 evening

403
00:23:58,976 --> 00:24:05,120
What's up yeah what's he think is going on maybe there's going to be some kind of felt like preemptive

404
00:24:05,376 --> 00:24:11,520
Bring it up at all with all the anxiety from

405
00:24:11,776 --> 00:24:12,544
He's like

406
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:16,128
All of that worry I put into whether or not

407
00:24:16,384 --> 00:24:17,664
Put out me whenever I J

408
00:24:18,176 --> 00:24:19,712
Fluid strong of n-word

409
00:24:19,968 --> 00:24:20,480
Together

410
00:24:20,736 --> 00:24:24,320
Nothing can hurt me now on the 29th

411
00:24:24,576 --> 00:24:25,344
How does he feel about

412
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:26,368
We'll see

413
00:24:26,624 --> 00:24:29,696
28 here we start Alex woke up

414
00:24:29,952 --> 00:24:30,464
Realer

415
00:24:31,232 --> 00:24:31,744
Because Barn

416
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:32,512
Tweeted something

417
00:24:32,768 --> 00:24:35,072
I woke up at 5 a.m. this morning

418
00:24:36,864 --> 00:24:40,192
Text message

419
00:24:43,008 --> 00:24:43,520
Good work on

420
00:24:45,056 --> 00:24:46,336
BBC article

421
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:54,528
This is the Line in the Sand

422
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:56,832
So many people in Salina stand for me

423
00:24:58,624 --> 00:25:00,416
And so I'm going to do my best job

424
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,208
Here today

425
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:07,840
Calmly and proficiently latest

426
00:25:09,632 --> 00:25:11,936
Despite the fact that I have been up since 5 a.m.

427
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:15,008
Researching preparing for this

428
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:17,568
Butterflies

429
00:25:18,336 --> 00:25:18,848
And

430
00:25:23,456 --> 00:25:23,968
Because

431
00:25:24,224 --> 00:25:26,016
So much data so much proof

432
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:30,112
All totally confirmed myself to use everybody else

433
00:25:30,368 --> 00:25:36,512
Every single day he does this now

434
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:40,352
In 10 minutes of look I would love to cover things

435
00:25:40,608 --> 00:25:44,192
Every single time I turn on the show now

436
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:45,984
I can barely do this

437
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,008
I'm not teasing

438
00:25:47,264 --> 00:25:49,312
I'm not trying to build suspense but

439
00:25:49,568 --> 00:25:51,104
Such big news that I can't get to it

440
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:51,872
It's just

441
00:25:52,128 --> 00:25:54,176
Over and over and over again

442
00:25:54,432 --> 00:25:55,456
It's become his like

443
00:25:55,712 --> 00:25:56,992
Rhetorical trick that

444
00:25:57,504 --> 00:25:59,552
Just Universal subtext all I have is

445
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:01,600
At Wheaton 3 headlights and I hope

446
00:26:01,856 --> 00:26:03,648
The colors don't suck today

447
00:26:03,904 --> 00:26:05,952
Tired

448
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:06,976
Yeah

449
00:26:07,488 --> 00:26:10,560
So you got to email everybody at I don't know.

450
00:26:10,816 --> 00:26:12,096
Traffic but you do need

451
00:26:12,352 --> 00:26:13,888
Email

452
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:15,936
Everyone you know

453
00:26:17,216 --> 00:26:17,728
You

454
00:26:19,008 --> 00:26:20,544
Everyone you know

455
00:26:21,824 --> 00:26:27,712
I assume people have an Alex phone tree

456
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:30,528
Scientific

457
00:26:32,832 --> 00:26:33,600
Medical

458
00:26:34,112 --> 00:26:35,904
Dictatorship

459
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:37,952
That is designed to depopulate the

460
00:26:41,536 --> 00:26:45,120
Infowars.com newswars.com

461
00:26:45,632 --> 00:26:48,704
Video Alex Jones

462
00:26:49,216 --> 00:26:51,264
Click on the left hand corner

463
00:26:55,104 --> 00:26:57,152
Send that out that's not a censored as much

464
00:26:58,944 --> 00:27:00,480
On the Internet it's easier to get out there

465
00:27:00,992 --> 00:27:07,136
Tuesday alive Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation microchip

466
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:08,672
One on

467
00:27:12,512 --> 00:27:15,072
World for sanay elections

468
00:27:16,608 --> 00:27:17,632
Tracers

469
00:27:20,192 --> 00:27:22,496
Call Michael the Beast

470
00:27:22,752 --> 00:27:24,800
Dunked on

471
00:27:25,312 --> 00:27:26,080
Were there

472
00:27:26,336 --> 00:27:32,224
I mean we're there again

473
00:27:36,832 --> 00:27:39,648
My narrative 5 years ago

474
00:27:42,208 --> 00:27:46,304
Here is where my mind almost broke while I was listening

475
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:52,704
To this I just like it's early in the show that's not good

476
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:56,032
Read to you from the BBC

477
00:27:57,824 --> 00:28:00,128
Rollout at MIT

478
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:01,664
USA Today

479
00:28:06,528 --> 00:28:09,856
Just checking the authors all of them

480
00:28:10,112 --> 00:28:12,416
I've written for the UN MIT and Bill Gates

481
00:28:13,952 --> 00:28:15,488
Exclusively

482
00:28:16,512 --> 00:28:18,816
On devices in your home and spy on you

483
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:20,352
Smart toilet

484
00:28:21,376 --> 00:28:23,424
Streetlights that watch and listen to you

485
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:26,496
Such a great example about how

486
00:28:26,752 --> 00:28:28,032
Frustrating

487
00:28:28,288 --> 00:28:29,568
Try and listen to Alex

488
00:28:29,824 --> 00:28:33,920
Because nothing he says means anything on Smart toilet

489
00:28:34,944 --> 00:28:38,528
Every step of what you just said there is almost impossible

490
00:28:38,784 --> 00:28:39,296
To discuss

491
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:40,576
As it's being present

492
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:46,976
He asserts that there's a rollout of articles about Gates

493
00:28:47,232 --> 00:28:50,048
This alone is unsubstantiated

494
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:52,096
Like what constitutes a roll

495
00:28:52,608 --> 00:28:55,424
How is Alex establishing if there is a roll out of

496
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:57,728
Stories

497
00:28:57,984 --> 00:29:01,056
Just based on a number of different Outlets the same press release

498
00:29:01,568 --> 00:29:02,592
Or something like that

499
00:29:02,848 --> 00:29:05,408
You know whenever you check the news

500
00:29:05,664 --> 00:29:10,016
And you have like Washington Post and USA Today the New York Times and all of those

501
00:29:10,272 --> 00:29:15,136
Did you notice that they only cover their news like they never cover the same story

502
00:29:15,392 --> 00:29:15,904
Stand it

503
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:17,696
Proprietary information

504
00:29:17,952 --> 00:29:21,792
It is there could be an instance where a bunch of different Outlets

505
00:29:22,048 --> 00:29:22,816
Recovering the same

506
00:29:23,072 --> 00:29:28,192
Reuters article on a PC

507
00:29:28,448 --> 00:29:33,056
And then you have a bunch of different Outlets covering that because it's an interesting story and okay

508
00:29:34,592 --> 00:29:35,616
It's like this

509
00:29:35,872 --> 00:29:37,152
First Step that he has

510
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:39,712
You can't defend that there's a roll out cuz it doesn't mean any

511
00:29:39,968 --> 00:29:40,736
What does it mean

512
00:29:40,992 --> 00:29:43,552
That means there's a role that okay

513
00:29:43,808 --> 00:29:48,160
People who wrote These articles about these Gates tattoos

514
00:29:48,416 --> 00:29:50,208
For the US and

515
00:29:50,464 --> 00:29:50,976
The right

516
00:29:51,232 --> 00:29:54,816
Exclusively about household spying devices like toilets

517
00:29:55,584 --> 00:29:58,400
This is kind of amazing because it's impressively

518
00:29:59,168 --> 00:30:00,960
Which authors is he talking about

519
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:04,032
You haven't even specified in article

520
00:30:05,312 --> 00:30:06,848
So this could be referring to anyone

521
00:30:07,104 --> 00:30:13,248
Why would you possibly go about checking into the hour-and-a-half

522
00:30:13,504 --> 00:30:14,272
There's no specific

523
00:30:14,784 --> 00:30:15,296
I could just

524
00:30:15,808 --> 00:30:16,576
I can't do it

525
00:30:16,832 --> 00:30:18,368
Then go to USA Today

526
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:19,392
I did

527
00:30:19,648 --> 00:30:23,232
Check every single author that has written for them

528
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:29,376
10 years

529
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:34,240
If you try to fact-check this claim you'll immediately run into the wall

530
00:30:34,496 --> 00:30:35,776
That you have no Lawn Shop

531
00:30:36,288 --> 00:30:42,432
You could maybe you don't find an article in USA Today that's about the right topic but how do you know it's the right one out

532
00:30:42,688 --> 00:30:43,968
Alex's vaguely referring to

533
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:49,344
Why you being so vague Alex's essentially said he completely unfalsifiable lie

534
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:54,720
Because I could find a USA Today article about these like a tattoos my tattoo

535
00:30:54,976 --> 00:30:59,072
And I can say like oh here's the author of it and it doesn't match anything

536
00:31:02,912 --> 00:31:07,520
So I found an article about this very idea of XE tattoos and Scientific American

537
00:31:07,776 --> 00:31:09,568
Which was written by Karen Weintraub

538
00:31:09,824 --> 00:31:12,896
Very simple searched over by line shows that she doesn't write

539
00:31:13,152 --> 00:31:15,200
Exclusively about appliances that are spying on you

540
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:16,992
Like the article

541
00:31:17,248 --> 00:31:19,040
Are human body temperature

542
00:31:19,552 --> 00:31:21,344
Like I said this means nothing

543
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:22,880
In terms of Alex's claim

544
00:31:23,136 --> 00:31:28,256
He can easily just say this wasn't one of the Articles it's part of his alleged rollout research from that morning

545
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:30,048
We're right back to where we started

546
00:31:30,816 --> 00:31:33,120
This is one of the ways that I was weaponizes Vegas

547
00:31:33,376 --> 00:31:39,520
And refusal to provide specific details in order to create the perception that the things he's making up or based on something real

548
00:31:40,032 --> 00:31:40,800
They're not

549
00:31:41,056 --> 00:31:42,336
He's just talkingshit

550
00:31:42,592 --> 00:31:44,384
What are you doing sneaking away

551
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,432
So makes no bulshit things he's

552
00:31:46,688 --> 00:31:47,968
Almost impossible to the bus

553
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:53,344
I mean I did check several thousand other articles this morning and they all proved that he was correct

554
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,904
So I mean

555
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:56,672
So

556
00:31:59,488 --> 00:32:00,768
Kind of suspicious evicted week

557
00:32:01,024 --> 00:32:02,048
Can pull back from the

558
00:32:02,304 --> 00:32:06,912
You know tweet that allegedly Alex got from Barnes that morning

559
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:09,728
Supposed to

560
00:32:09,984 --> 00:32:10,752
This ship

561
00:32:11,008 --> 00:32:13,056
Picture of alleged research

562
00:32:13,312 --> 00:32:16,128
So that article was written by a woman named Lena zeldovich

563
00:32:16,384 --> 00:32:17,920
Who absolutely doesn't write

564
00:32:18,176 --> 00:32:20,480
Exclusively about spying appliances in toilet

565
00:32:20,992 --> 00:32:27,136
Within the last month she's written articles on topics ranging from potential lung damage that could come from Saharan dust cloud

566
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:34,304
Devices spying on you other articles like why high-end hotels are uniquely positioned to rebound

567
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:37,376
From the Coronavirus

568
00:32:37,888 --> 00:32:39,168
Nothing Alex says means anything

569
00:32:39,424 --> 00:32:41,984
He's just making stuff up to create the feeling he's looking

570
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,264
Engendering is audien

571
00:32:44,032 --> 00:32:44,800
In this case he wants

572
00:32:45,056 --> 00:32:49,664
Listen to feel like there's a conspiracy of people in Media

573
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:51,456
So did you accomplish that he

574
00:32:51,712 --> 00:32:52,224
Pretend

575
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:56,832
That he was up all morning researching author

576
00:32:57,344 --> 00:32:59,648
And Heather now all pushing vaccine tattoos

577
00:32:59,904 --> 00:33:01,952
It's a complete and pure fabrication

578
00:33:02,208 --> 00:33:04,256
And I don't even believe Alex was up before 8

579
00:33:04,768 --> 00:33:05,536
I just don't believe it

580
00:33:06,048 --> 00:33:06,560
I buy it

581
00:33:08,608 --> 00:33:14,752
5 I imagine he probably has some sort of apnea still that he's still got to deal with

582
00:33:15,008 --> 00:33:20,896
Lately he's been saying

583
00:33:21,152 --> 00:33:21,664
You can't

584
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,200
Fake having sleep apnea

585
00:33:23,456 --> 00:33:26,272
You can fake having sleep apnea but that's unfair

586
00:33:26,528 --> 00:33:29,600
It's mean I felt that I felt empathy for a second

587
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:34,976
C a b

588
00:33:36,512 --> 00:33:41,376
Made me throw my computer cross the road because it's that that game that's being played.

589
00:33:41,632 --> 00:33:43,680
Okay you want to make it so

590
00:33:43,936 --> 00:33:44,448
I can't

591
00:33:44,704 --> 00:33:45,984
Know what you're talkin about

592
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:49,568
And if I'm actively looking into the things you talk about

593
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:52,640
How much more abusive is that two people who passively listen

594
00:33:53,152 --> 00:33:53,664
Don't even

595
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:55,968
Confirm thanks

596
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:57,248
I was up all morning

597
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:59,808
All these people just talk about spy toilet

598
00:34:00,832 --> 00:34:04,928
All I need for corroboration is you saying you are up all morning

599
00:34:05,184 --> 00:34:05,696
Like a lot of work

600
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:07,744
So Alex

601
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:08,768
Does this

602
00:34:09,024 --> 00:34:12,608
I'm going to go to break and he comes back it was a goddamn baby in the studio

603
00:34:13,888 --> 00:34:14,912
Sonny's

604
00:34:15,168 --> 00:34:16,192
Take me to bigger than I am

605
00:34:17,216 --> 00:34:19,264
But this guy is super handsome

606
00:34:23,872 --> 00:34:25,920
Mess with anybody but

607
00:34:29,248 --> 00:34:30,272
Calendar

608
00:34:30,528 --> 00:34:32,064
Here is the Sun

609
00:34:36,672 --> 00:34:37,952
12

610
00:34:38,464 --> 00:34:39,744
Got this guy and I tell you

611
00:34:43,328 --> 00:34:44,096
100-percent

612
00:34:45,632 --> 00:34:48,192
Parsley and infomercial

613
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:52,800
Onesies available at infowarsstore.com Elsa

614
00:34:53,056 --> 00:34:55,616
Infowars

615
00:34:55,872 --> 00:34:59,968
Studio

616
00:35:00,224 --> 00:35:00,992
Lookout

617
00:35:01,248 --> 00:35:04,320
Like Blown Away by how surreal this

618
00:35:04,576 --> 00:35:05,600
This this shift is

619
00:35:07,136 --> 00:35:08,416
Pretty severe

620
00:35:08,672 --> 00:35:13,024
Barnes texted me this thing you need to email everybody is it covid

621
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,816
Mediately after

622
00:35:15,328 --> 00:35:21,472
You little baby right propaganda

623
00:35:21,728 --> 00:35:27,872
Racism to new Justin Bieber

624
00:35:28,128 --> 00:35:32,480
Matter is such a great slogan

625
00:35:39,136 --> 00:35:40,160
Great thing that the world

626
00:35:41,696 --> 00:35:42,208
Just great

627
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:48,864
This interview doesn't go well because the baby and the baby's father

628
00:35:49,632 --> 00:35:50,400
Very uncomfortable

629
00:35:50,912 --> 00:35:52,960
I know it's close to his bedtime but he is a sweetheart

630
00:35:54,496 --> 00:35:55,520
He's such a good boy

631
00:35:58,848 --> 00:36:01,152
Nope didn't completely healthy never been sick

632
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:14,464
It is you can really tell in their eyes we know when it is they just kind of look like something's missing

633
00:36:24,192 --> 00:36:27,008
Most girls

634
00:36:29,568 --> 00:36:30,848
Yeah I just know

635
00:36:31,872 --> 00:36:33,152
Not happen over here

636
00:36:33,664 --> 00:36:36,224
Just a little boy

637
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:40,064
Like I can tell you the boys

638
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:43,136
Well you commit the crime

639
00:36:43,648 --> 00:36:44,160
Wow

640
00:36:44,416 --> 00:36:47,232
Social worker

641
00:36:47,488 --> 00:36:50,816
The right is really good comedy

642
00:36:56,704 --> 00:36:57,984
Phyno

643
00:36:58,752 --> 00:36:59,776
Crayola babies like this

644
00:37:00,032 --> 00:37:00,800
I don't want

645
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:02,592
Children

646
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:06,432
Oh yeah

647
00:37:07,456 --> 00:37:09,760
This is just a disaster ever

648
00:37:10,016 --> 00:37:11,552
You bring this baby out

649
00:37:11,808 --> 00:37:15,648
It's it's totally very weird

650
00:37:17,696 --> 00:37:21,792
The transphobia completely unnecessary

651
00:37:22,304 --> 00:37:27,680
I mean because he doesn't have much else to do with this baby isn't really a good scene partner

652
00:37:27,936 --> 00:37:31,008
No we could use some Second City Improv

653
00:37:31,264 --> 00:37:32,032
No Doubt

654
00:37:32,288 --> 00:37:36,896
I find the Democrat babies

655
00:37:37,152 --> 00:37:41,248
Every time that I've gotten into a Herald Democrat baby

656
00:37:41,504 --> 00:37:42,528
Babe can sing

657
00:37:42,784 --> 00:37:46,368
Do you know it's crazy though and here's what I ears or bothers me about baby

658
00:37:46,624 --> 00:37:52,768
Are those b******* liberals they don't do anything Dan they're just like

659
00:37:53,024 --> 00:37:55,584
Let's wait and see and let's hope somebody else

660
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:57,376
They're not leftist

661
00:37:57,632 --> 00:37:58,656
Out in the street

662
00:37:58,912 --> 00:38:01,728
Dan I don't want to I don't want to play this game

663
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:04,800
So Alex realizes

664
00:38:05,056 --> 00:38:11,200
Maybe the best place for him and so he calls in Darren McMurray who's the baby's Grandpa

665
00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:12,480
Has him take over the Segway

666
00:38:12,736 --> 00:38:15,808
How God his grandfather

667
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,088
Yes he is

668
00:38:17,344 --> 00:38:18,112
Oh my goodness

669
00:38:18,368 --> 00:38:19,648
You want to say hi to Grandpa

670
00:38:20,928 --> 00:38:22,976
You know that is what you want

671
00:38:23,232 --> 00:38:23,744
Golden Grandpa

672
00:38:24,256 --> 00:38:25,280
Where is Grandpa

673
00:38:29,632 --> 00:38:31,680
Darren is not a butterfly

674
00:38:44,736 --> 00:38:45,504
Hungry

675
00:38:46,528 --> 00:38:48,576
That's my special boy

676
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:58,304
Extreme things

677
00:38:58,560 --> 00:38:59,584
Turn off my grass.

678
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:00,352
It's

679
00:39:01,888 --> 00:39:02,656
I really

680
00:39:03,936 --> 00:39:08,544
Mostly playlist it's very weird but I mostly play this cuz like

681
00:39:09,824 --> 00:39:11,616
You're going to happen throughout the rest of this episode

682
00:39:11,872 --> 00:39:12,640
Please remember

683
00:39:13,152 --> 00:39:15,200
Outside baby

684
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:21,856
Sacrament of the 28th

685
00:39:22,112 --> 00:39:23,648
Capriciousness of just like

686
00:39:29,024 --> 00:39:32,352
Get over here and you're going to host the segment for a while

687
00:39:32,608 --> 00:39:36,704
Doesn't like being on it

688
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:40,032
He was referring pologize for believing people when they say

689
00:39:40,288 --> 00:39:41,312
He was making a joke

690
00:39:41,568 --> 00:39:43,360
About how the baby had butterflies

691
00:39:43,616 --> 00:39:44,384
To be on air

692
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:47,712
That was a reference to a group

693
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:49,504
Basically an on-air host

694
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,808
You would be doing

695
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:55,392
Adidas

696
00:39:55,648 --> 00:39:56,672
He is more like

697
00:39:56,928 --> 00:39:57,952
I'm between person guys

698
00:39:58,208 --> 00:40:00,512
Definitely do special reports

699
00:40:02,048 --> 00:40:03,072
Very much

700
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:07,936
So now we get back tattoo

701
00:40:08,192 --> 00:40:08,960
Narrative

702
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:10,752
Is weird

703
00:40:17,152 --> 00:40:17,920
Text

704
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:19,968
Can pull that up

705
00:40:21,248 --> 00:40:24,064
Microsoft.com in quote digital tattoos

706
00:40:24,832 --> 00:40:28,160
So you can have

707
00:40:28,416 --> 00:40:31,232
Prove you've had enough vaccine medical record all that

708
00:40:31,488 --> 00:40:33,792
My point is I'm going to show you something Cardinals right now

709
00:40:35,328 --> 00:40:37,632
This is all being announced

710
00:40:40,448 --> 00:40:41,728
But remember

711
00:40:44,032 --> 00:40:44,800
Just

712
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:47,872
A few months ago there is Microsoft

713
00:40:49,408 --> 00:40:50,688
Smart tattoos

714
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:54,272
So

715
00:40:56,064 --> 00:40:59,136
We come out and we expose what they're doing what they're up to

716
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:04,000
In January February March and April lay out exactly what they were going to do

717
00:41:04,256 --> 00:41:06,560
Operation lockstep Rockefeller

718
00:41:06,816 --> 00:41:07,328
10 years old

719
00:41:07,584 --> 00:41:08,608
Exactly

720
00:41:08,864 --> 00:41:13,472
Nope so specific cross reference

721
00:41:13,728 --> 00:41:15,008
See if I can figure out what's going on

722
00:41:15,776 --> 00:41:17,312
Start with the Microsoft

723
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:22,944
Alex just pulled up a page for smart tattoos on Microsoft research project website

724
00:41:23,456 --> 00:41:28,576
It's nothing secret or nefarious it's actually interesting technology

725
00:41:28,832 --> 00:41:33,184
We've been able to create topical temporary tattoos

726
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:34,720
Control that you can hook up to like you

727
00:41:34,976 --> 00:41:36,256
Your phone through Bluetooth

728
00:41:37,024 --> 00:41:42,400
Simple imagine what this technology looks like is to imagine

729
00:41:42,656 --> 00:41:43,424
Things on your arm

730
00:41:43,936 --> 00:41:50,080
When you touch the first one you can have it connected via Bluetooth to the lights in your living room so touching your arm could talk

731
00:41:52,895 --> 00:41:56,223
The second button Scooby Channel up and down button

732
00:41:56,479 --> 00:41:58,015
Install remote control your television

733
00:41:59,807 --> 00:42:02,879
Like button remote

734
00:42:03,135 --> 00:42:09,279
Control there's a number of other like application that you can imagine

735
00:42:09,535 --> 00:42:13,375
Video game

736
00:42:14,655 --> 00:42:16,959
Temporary

737
00:42:17,215 --> 00:42:18,495
Yeah I'm sure it's actually

738
00:42:19,007 --> 00:42:24,639
The project it at Microsoft is literally nothing like what Alex's rambling about his dystopian fever dream

739
00:42:24,895 --> 00:42:26,431
Something

740
00:42:26,687 --> 00:42:27,455
Even recent

741
00:42:27,967 --> 00:42:30,527
There's an article on Microsoft like the page that Alex

742
00:42:30,783 --> 00:42:31,551
Pulls up from

743
00:42:31,807 --> 00:42:33,087
August 2018

744
00:42:33,343 --> 00:42:36,159
And I was able to easily find an article on quartz about this from

745
00:42:36,415 --> 00:42:37,183
August 26th

746
00:42:38,207 --> 00:42:44,351
I'm sure now it would still consider this technology to work of the devil all the same but

747
00:42:44,607 --> 00:42:45,119
Doing today

748
00:42:45,375 --> 00:42:48,447
Also none of the authors involved in those articles about

749
00:42:48,703 --> 00:42:51,775
This technology exclusively right about spying toilet

750
00:42:52,031 --> 00:42:53,567
Quick question

751
00:42:54,847 --> 00:42:56,895
He is referring of course to his coverage

752
00:42:57,151 --> 00:42:59,199
In February and March whenever he laid out the

753
00:42:59,455 --> 00:43:00,479
The plan and let us all

754
00:43:01,503 --> 00:43:04,831
Is he still on the it's over for Humanity

755
00:43:06,879 --> 00:43:07,903
You know what yes he is

756
00:43:08,159 --> 00:43:14,047
Yes he is right so the plan at that time we are all going to die

757
00:43:14,303 --> 00:43:14,815
Well

758
00:43:15,071 --> 00:43:17,375
Reed will get a sentence

759
00:43:19,935 --> 00:43:26,079
At that point yes that was going to kill everyone

760
00:43:26,847 --> 00:43:27,871
Alex

761
00:43:28,127 --> 00:43:29,151
Has an interesting

762
00:43:29,407 --> 00:43:33,247
Death toll videos going to bring up later in this episode

763
00:43:33,503 --> 00:43:34,015
No

764
00:43:35,807 --> 00:43:36,575
7 million

765
00:43:37,343 --> 00:43:42,975
Higher

766
00:43:43,487 --> 00:43:48,095
Don't have the BBC article

767
00:43:48,607 --> 00:43:49,375
And it's a little

768
00:43:49,631 --> 00:43:50,655
Closer to italics

769
00:43:51,423 --> 00:43:52,191
Kind of talking about

770
00:43:52,703 --> 00:43:56,799
The headline of the piece is quotes will travel be safer by 2022

771
00:43:57,311 --> 00:44:00,639
This is an article by the aforementioned Lena's zeldovich

772
00:44:00,895 --> 00:44:01,919
Who doesn't write

773
00:44:02,175 --> 00:44:03,455
Exclusively about buying toilets

774
00:44:03,967 --> 00:44:08,319
This is a discussion about emerging technologies that could help facilitate travel in the near future

775
00:44:08,575 --> 00:44:11,135
An industry that's been hit particularly hard by covid-19

776
00:44:11,391 --> 00:44:11,903
19

777
00:44:12,159 --> 00:44:18,303
She discusses a breakthrough in breathalyzer type technology that's been created by

778
00:44:18,559 --> 00:44:19,327
Versiti in Israel

779
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:25,727
Apparently his breathalyzer showing a 92% accuracy rate so it may be fairly close to being up for consideration

780
00:44:26,239 --> 00:44:30,079
Is it means to be able to control the spread of the virus while still allowing ce4less

781
00:44:30,335 --> 00:44:31,103
Restricted travel

782
00:44:31,871 --> 00:44:33,407
One of the other Technologies that's

783
00:44:33,663 --> 00:44:36,223
Disgust is the vaccine record tattoos that have been

784
00:44:36,479 --> 00:44:37,247
Research by Folks at

785
00:44:37,503 --> 00:44:38,015
MIT

786
00:44:38,271 --> 00:44:42,879
Technology has received funding from Bill and Melinda Gates at research

787
00:44:43,391 --> 00:44:45,439
Nothing in this article says you'll need of exit

788
00:44:45,695 --> 00:44:47,231
Can you tattoo in order to travel in the future

789
00:44:47,999 --> 00:44:49,791
This article honestly is just

790
00:44:50,047 --> 00:44:52,095
Zeldovich is perspective on what

791
00:44:52,351 --> 00:44:54,655
Could be coming in terms of

792
00:44:54,911 --> 00:44:58,239
Futurist kind of baby

793
00:44:58,495 --> 00:45:00,031
Even the article says quote

794
00:45:00,287 --> 00:45:05,151
Travelers present bee costumes officers with an entrance visa and a vaccination record

795
00:45:05,663 --> 00:45:10,783
That could be a paper card or a tiny tattoo on their arm invisible

796
00:45:11,039 --> 00:45:11,807
Infrared scanner

797
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:18,463
Even in her vision of what travel could look like in 2022 people would still rather have a paper record

798
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:19,487
Vaccination history

799
00:45:19,743 --> 00:45:23,071
Or if they wanted to they could get their tattoo of a vaccine Wrecker

800
00:45:23,583 --> 00:45:29,727
I'm going to go with let's do the Sci-Fi dystopia scenario and get them right behind our Earline.

801
00:45:29,983 --> 00:45:33,055
Sounds great even so isn't this still the same

802
00:45:33,311 --> 00:45:35,615
They're still saying that you need a vaccine to travel

803
00:45:36,383 --> 00:45:38,943
As it turns out this is already the case in a lot of countries

804
00:45:39,455 --> 00:45:45,599
Countries including Australia Travelers

805
00:45:45,855 --> 00:45:48,415
Areas affected by yellow fever vaccination

806
00:45:48,671 --> 00:45:50,463
The condition has a requirement for entry

807
00:45:50,975 --> 00:45:53,279
It's sort of Public Health protocol already exist

808
00:45:53,535 --> 00:45:58,399
Honestly the way would most likely be implemented in the case of covid-19

809
00:45:58,655 --> 00:46:00,959
It's probably the same as the yellow fever situation

810
00:46:01,215 --> 00:46:07,103
Countries will be able to set their own standards for barring entry depending on their Public Health situation requires

811
00:46:07,615 --> 00:46:09,663
You can easily see that being the case of covid-19

812
00:46:09,919 --> 00:46:10,431
Did we develop

813
00:46:10,687 --> 00:46:12,223
Successful vaccine in the near future

814
00:46:12,479 --> 00:46:14,271
Things return to somewhat normal

815
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:18,111
This vaccine tattoo record has never been used on life

816
00:46:18,367 --> 00:46:20,415
Subject

817
00:46:20,671 --> 00:46:21,183
And the Ulta

818
00:46:21,439 --> 00:46:27,583
Golden would be to provide records for people quotes in the developing world where paper and electronic records are not always

819
00:46:28,607 --> 00:46:30,143
The article goes on to say that quote

820
00:46:30,399 --> 00:46:31,935
The goal is to try it on

821
00:46:32,191 --> 00:46:33,727
Measles vaccine soon

822
00:46:33,983 --> 00:46:36,799
But the tech may come in handy for other proofs of immunization

823
00:46:37,055 --> 00:46:38,335
For example at the

824
00:46:38,591 --> 00:46:39,103
Pinpoint

825
00:46:39,615 --> 00:46:41,407
The article discusses innovation

826
00:46:41,663 --> 00:46:43,967
Sounds like good smelling sanitizer is it

827
00:46:44,223 --> 00:46:46,015
UV light technology

828
00:46:47,807 --> 00:46:51,391
That sounds great but also to make little cages

829
00:46:51,647 --> 00:46:54,463
This article is absolutely not with Alex's reporting it as

830
00:46:54,975 --> 00:46:58,815
He's saying that it's proof positive that the mark of the beast is here and they're rolling out their plans

831
00:46:59,583 --> 00:47:00,607
Could just be

832
00:47:00,863 --> 00:47:04,959
Just as I was about a nefarious

833
00:47:05,215 --> 00:47:05,983
Plan to fund

834
00:47:08,031 --> 00:47:12,383
Lavender scented eco-friendly sanitizer

835
00:47:13,151 --> 00:47:14,431
I think the global issue

836
00:47:14,687 --> 00:47:16,991
Shoot a lot lower

837
00:47:17,503 --> 00:47:18,015
Onsen

838
00:47:27,231 --> 00:47:32,863
He's talking about that timeline of the denial in the confirmation

839
00:47:33,375 --> 00:47:34,911
Import

840
00:47:35,167 --> 00:47:39,775
To me frustrated me and almost baby throw my

841
00:47:40,031 --> 00:47:40,543
Computer

842
00:47:40,799 --> 00:47:41,567
At the beginning of the episode

843
00:47:43,103 --> 00:47:45,151
Every publication

844
00:47:45,663 --> 00:47:46,943
To the LA Times to wired

845
00:47:48,735 --> 00:47:50,527
Come out and say

846
00:47:51,807 --> 00:47:56,415
There are no digital tattoos

847
00:47:56,927 --> 00:47:58,207
None of this is true

848
00:47:58,975 --> 00:48:01,279
Even though they were already proposing

849
00:48:07,679 --> 00:48:13,311
Marshalls

850
00:48:13,823 --> 00:48:15,103
Digital passport or a

851
00:48:18,943 --> 00:48:20,223
You just said you weren't doing that

852
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:29,695
They have not announced on the Microsoft website of the shuttles leave yours

853
00:48:29,951 --> 00:48:34,303
Foundation

854
00:48:34,815 --> 00:48:35,327
Directly

855
00:48:39,423 --> 00:48:45,567
So no one is saying and has been saying that the invisible tattoo vaccine records are completely made up

856
00:48:45,823 --> 00:48:47,103
Ready

857
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:49,151
Yes the research wasn't complete

858
00:48:49,407 --> 00:48:54,271
Entire narrative

859
00:48:54,527 --> 00:48:56,575
Oh you denying

860
00:49:00,159 --> 00:49:01,183
That a month later there's a

861
00:49:02,207 --> 00:49:08,351
This clip was so useful to me though because at the end of their Alex confirms BBC article

862
00:49:08,607 --> 00:49:09,119
Written by the purse

863
00:49:09,375 --> 00:49:11,167
He was saying

864
00:49:12,191 --> 00:49:13,983
Yeah right about spying

865
00:49:14,751 --> 00:49:15,263
Appliances

866
00:49:15,775 --> 00:49:18,335
If you Google Lena Zelda Zelda

867
00:49:18,591 --> 00:49:20,639
Bill Gates pops up

868
00:49:22,175 --> 00:49:22,687
That you wrote back

869
00:49:22,943 --> 00:49:23,967
2017 called

870
00:49:25,503 --> 00:49:26,015
Toilet

871
00:49:26,527 --> 00:49:31,647
This article was about her traveling to Madagascar to explore a company that was developing waterless toilets

872
00:49:31,903 --> 00:49:34,463
Which is a very important sort of technology for the developing world

873
00:49:34,719 --> 00:49:39,327
Where sanitation is a major concern in Water Resources might not be available to

874
00:49:39,583 --> 00:49:40,095
Expend

875
00:49:42,911 --> 00:49:43,679
That's huge

876
00:49:43,935 --> 00:49:45,983
Involvement of Bill Gates

877
00:49:46,239 --> 00:49:49,055
Year was it in 2011 is foundation ran a challenge

878
00:49:49,311 --> 00:49:50,335
It's called the

879
00:49:50,591 --> 00:49:51,103
Toilet

880
00:49:51,615 --> 00:49:56,991
Square they solicited ideas about how people could create sustainable sanitation in the developing world

881
00:49:57,503 --> 00:49:58,783
It was a grant contest

882
00:49:59,039 --> 00:50:01,087
And this person Virginia Gardner

883
00:50:01,343 --> 00:50:05,183
Cheap designed became a startup called

884
00:50:05,695 --> 00:50:10,815
Which is what this article is about

885
00:50:11,071 --> 00:50:12,607
That's some good

886
00:50:12,863 --> 00:50:15,935
Right there

887
00:50:16,191 --> 00:50:18,751
Waste is collected to be converted into usable biogas

888
00:50:19,263 --> 00:50:21,311
Supposedly odor-free

889
00:50:21,567 --> 00:50:22,079
Which is huge

890
00:50:22,591 --> 00:50:28,735
The rest of this article involves more information about the history of toilets

891
00:50:28,991 --> 00:50:31,039
Almost certainly Google

892
00:50:31,295 --> 00:50:34,879
Found this article and he decided to write a little story about it it has nothing

893
00:50:35,135 --> 00:50:35,903
Things to do with reality

894
00:50:36,671 --> 00:50:39,487
From this article about a woman and water Gates Foundation Grant

895
00:50:39,743 --> 00:50:42,815
Waterless toilets

896
00:50:43,327 --> 00:50:46,655
Alex has reported that Lena zeldovich rights

897
00:50:46,911 --> 00:50:49,983
An almost exclusively about spying appliances like toilet

898
00:50:50,751 --> 00:50:53,311
It's a complete fabrication that came out of his imagination

899
00:50:53,823 --> 00:50:54,847
I never would have been able to

900
00:50:55,103 --> 00:50:55,615
Figure this out

901
00:50:57,407 --> 00:50:59,199
Go bad if he hadn't specified toilets

902
00:50:59,455 --> 00:51:00,223
In his rambling

903
00:51:00,735 --> 00:51:03,039
This is why he needs to be as big as possible

904
00:51:03,295 --> 00:51:08,415
Because a nice tree detail has the possibility of unraveling the flimsy ship is narratives are built on

905
00:51:09,183 --> 00:51:11,999
Also to be perfectly sure that I wasn't misrepresenting things

906
00:51:12,255 --> 00:51:14,815
Microsoft

907
00:51:15,071 --> 00:51:15,839
Smart tattoo page

908
00:51:16,095 --> 00:51:18,911
That you showed on screen is the same one that I found

909
00:51:19,167 --> 00:51:20,959
It has stuff from

910
00:51:21,983 --> 00:51:24,287
It's not and it's not a related story at all

911
00:51:24,543 --> 00:51:26,591
It's about remote control you can have

912
00:51:26,847 --> 00:51:27,871
Touchscreen on your hand

913
00:51:28,127 --> 00:51:29,663
That's fantastic research

914
00:51:29,919 --> 00:51:30,943
Great detective work

915
00:51:31,199 --> 00:51:32,735
I'm still a little bitter at Gates

916
00:51:32,991 --> 00:51:34,271
For rejecting my

917
00:51:34,527 --> 00:51:35,807
Sebastian which was

918
00:51:36,063 --> 00:51:38,623
Everybody s**** on the grass and we carry bags

919
00:51:39,903 --> 00:51:42,207
I think it works for dogs

920
00:51:42,463 --> 00:51:45,279
Doesn't work for dogs

921
00:51:46,303 --> 00:51:48,607
I don't know if this is a good solution

922
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:55,263
Anyway

923
00:51:58,591 --> 00:52:02,943
Intersection cut this article about toilets

924
00:52:03,455 --> 00:52:05,503
That's great that really good research

925
00:52:06,015 --> 00:52:06,527
You did a great job

926
00:52:06,783 --> 00:52:08,063
Accidental

927
00:52:08,319 --> 00:52:13,183
I mean you just like I get you

928
00:52:13,695 --> 00:52:15,487
Well anyway

929
00:52:15,743 --> 00:52:16,767
Much like these toilets

930
00:52:17,279 --> 00:52:19,327
Other than turned into BIOS

931
00:52:19,583 --> 00:52:23,679
I love it starts article

932
00:52:25,215 --> 00:52:25,727
BBC

933
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:28,543
Zeldovich

934
00:52:28,799 --> 00:52:30,079
666

935
00:52:33,663 --> 00:52:37,503
Looks like the citizen scientist revising and Technology

936
00:52:37,759 --> 00:52:38,527
Contessa

937
00:52:38,783 --> 00:52:39,551
Globe-trot again

938
00:52:40,831 --> 00:52:42,879
And she says my 2020

939
00:52:43,135 --> 00:52:45,439
You'll get off an airplane a robot will scan

940
00:52:49,535 --> 00:52:55,423
Odd in your mouth that other diseases

941
00:52:56,703 --> 00:52:58,239
It's no big deal

942
00:52:58,751 --> 00:53:01,567
And if you just go through how to buy and sell and live your life

943
00:53:05,919 --> 00:53:10,015
The global medical ID and they said they're going to have all seven and a half billion people

944
00:53:11,295 --> 00:53:13,599
Don't worry they'll give you money to get chip

945
00:53:14,879 --> 00:53:16,671
Don't worry it's just a patch you put on your arm

946
00:53:16,927 --> 00:53:17,951
You might have a rash

947
00:53:19,231 --> 00:53:20,767
You're going to have nanotech

948
00:53:21,023 --> 00:53:21,791
In your body

949
00:53:22,303 --> 00:53:24,095
It is a long article

950
00:53:26,655 --> 00:53:27,167
You do read this

951
00:53:27,423 --> 00:53:27,935
For yourself

952
00:53:28,191 --> 00:53:33,823
This should go without saying but almost everything you saying article

953
00:53:34,335 --> 00:53:39,199
It isn't no way inaccurate or say or characterization of what zeldovich wrote and it

954
00:53:42,527 --> 00:53:46,879
It's also not a very long article 1574 words

955
00:53:47,135 --> 00:53:51,999
And to give you some sense of how much of it is about this potential technology vexing tattoos

956
00:53:52,511 --> 00:53:58,655
Makes up only 245 of the words in the article

957
00:53:58,911 --> 00:54:05,055
The article is about uv-light technologies that could be used

958
00:54:05,311 --> 00:54:11,455
Clean playing between twice

959
00:54:11,711 --> 00:54:14,015
We bulshit to scare his audience like there's

960
00:54:14,527 --> 00:54:17,343
There's nothing going on here this is just embarrassing

961
00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:19,903
Just feel like The Mark of the Beast should have like

962
00:54:20,415 --> 00:54:21,439
Diminishing returns

963
00:54:22,207 --> 00:54:26,815
The mark of the beast is that toilet since I've been alive

964
00:54:27,071 --> 00:54:30,399
Every year there's been a new mark of the beast coming

965
00:54:30,655 --> 00:54:36,799
I'm done with it Alex's also about Doctor Who

966
00:54:37,055 --> 00:54:38,079
Hydroxychloroquine

967
00:54:38,335 --> 00:54:40,639
The video getting taken down

968
00:54:40,895 --> 00:54:45,247
No point does he mention some of her extracurricular activities about

969
00:54:45,759 --> 00:54:47,039
Demon sex

970
00:54:47,295 --> 00:54:50,879
And whatever he has any objections

971
00:54:51,135 --> 00:54:56,255
You just treated as another totally right being shut down by the man

972
00:54:56,511 --> 00:55:02,655
I don't really have a lot of time for this narrative so too much other stuff

973
00:55:03,679 --> 00:55:06,495
Kind of a trivial matter in Alex's coverage

974
00:55:07,007 --> 00:55:12,127
We're just going to

975
00:55:12,639 --> 00:55:14,175
But much more

976
00:55:14,431 --> 00:55:16,223
Yes the price of gold

977
00:55:20,575 --> 00:55:25,183
Given the circumstances in the physical

978
00:55:25,695 --> 00:55:31,327
Triangle be interested in

979
00:55:31,583 --> 00:55:34,399
And raise the price of gold to

980
00:55:34,655 --> 00:55:35,423
The point where it's at

981
00:55:36,191 --> 00:55:36,959
And

982
00:55:37,983 --> 00:55:38,751
Alex

983
00:55:39,007 --> 00:55:41,311
It turns out

984
00:55:41,823 --> 00:55:43,615
Nobody's trying

985
00:55:44,127 --> 00:55:48,223
Anderson back in the game

986
00:55:48,479 --> 00:55:49,503
Are you using

987
00:55:50,015 --> 00:55:53,087
The cupboard crisis of excuse to shut down the economy

988
00:55:53,599 --> 00:55:55,135
Before it collapses on its own

989
00:55:55,391 --> 00:55:56,927
Consolidate power

990
00:55:58,975 --> 00:55:59,743
Dollars an ounce

991
00:56:01,279 --> 00:56:03,839
People ask why don't you have a gold sponsor

992
00:56:04,607 --> 00:56:08,703
I know why

993
00:56:08,959 --> 00:56:10,751
Show me overcharge people

994
00:56:11,775 --> 00:56:14,335
More than 5% over on Boolean

995
00:56:14,591 --> 00:56:17,151
Volume 15%

996
00:56:18,431 --> 00:56:20,223
Keep the lights on

997
00:56:22,783 --> 00:56:24,831
Market like Alex usurious

998
00:56:29,439 --> 00:56:31,487
I'm working with some years ago

999
00:56:38,911 --> 00:56:42,239
We are looking by next week to have a gold sponsor of everybody's everybody's to beat

1000
00:56:42,495 --> 00:56:43,007
Yorktown

1001
00:56:43,775 --> 00:56:44,543
So I'll keep you posted

1002
00:56:44,799 --> 00:56:50,431
Johnson

1003
00:56:50,687 --> 00:56:54,527
Kick down the wall like that like and just show up.

1004
00:56:58,111 --> 00:57:00,671
I mean I guess in suspension is probably over

1005
00:57:00,927 --> 00:57:04,767
But you wasn't barred for life from precious metal sales

1006
00:57:11,167 --> 00:57:12,447
Can go read those

1007
00:57:12,703 --> 00:57:13,471
Those Court filing

1008
00:57:13,727 --> 00:57:17,311
Yeah I mean honestly he could restart because he doesn't really need to have that much

1009
00:57:17,567 --> 00:57:22,687
Gold on hand the whole idea is that it's imaginary he was

1010
00:57:22,943 --> 00:57:23,967
Made to pay

1011
00:57:24,223 --> 00:57:27,807
Hundreds of thousands of dollars in restitution to customers that he

1012
00:57:28,063 --> 00:57:29,343
Defraud

1013
00:57:29,599 --> 00:57:30,623
So

1014
00:57:34,719 --> 00:57:36,511
Jim Baker bounce back

1015
00:57:36,767 --> 00:57:40,607
Imprisoned

1016
00:57:41,119 --> 00:57:45,215
I'll be very interested to see how this works

1017
00:57:48,287 --> 00:57:51,615
Dbd game

1018
00:57:53,407 --> 00:57:59,039
Gold Leaf commercial for CBDs

1019
00:57:59,551 --> 00:58:00,319
Everybody got

1020
00:58:00,831 --> 00:58:03,391
Genesis communication that gives out loans

1021
00:58:03,647 --> 00:58:05,695
Wonder Valex got one

1022
00:58:06,207 --> 00:58:08,767
Anyways

1023
00:58:09,023 --> 00:58:11,071
I'm looking forward to seeing if gold sales

1024
00:58:11,327 --> 00:58:11,839
Girls come back

1025
00:58:12,095 --> 00:58:15,167
Alex's

1026
00:58:15,423 --> 00:58:19,007
Chaves

1027
00:58:19,263 --> 00:58:23,359
To come back like I don't think Peter Schiff Show

1028
00:58:23,615 --> 00:58:25,407
I think a lot of the people who are the

1029
00:58:25,919 --> 00:58:31,295
Real gold salespeople Ron Paul libertarian

1030
00:58:31,551 --> 00:58:33,343
And I don't think a lot of them made the jump

1031
00:58:33,599 --> 00:58:34,111
To Trump

1032
00:58:34,367 --> 00:58:35,903
Writerly

1033
00:58:36,159 --> 00:58:37,951
Problem

1034
00:58:38,463 --> 00:58:39,231
But

1035
00:58:39,999 --> 00:58:42,815
Alex's

1036
00:58:43,071 --> 00:58:46,143
He's very funny

1037
00:58:46,399 --> 00:58:47,423
Some to wear a mask in public

1038
00:58:47,935 --> 00:58:49,215
Because he has a good new B

1039
00:58:57,151 --> 00:58:58,687
This just came in

1040
00:59:04,319 --> 00:59:05,855
Successfully

1041
00:59:06,111 --> 00:59:06,623
The Chinaman

1042
00:59:10,463 --> 00:59:11,231
Superman

1043
00:59:13,279 --> 00:59:13,791
Look at me

1044
00:59:21,471 --> 00:59:22,751
Oh yeah you're bad

1045
00:59:25,567 --> 00:59:28,895
Probably

1046
00:59:29,919 --> 00:59:31,199
A dog a b****

1047
00:59:31,711 --> 00:59:32,223
You know

1048
00:59:32,479 --> 00:59:33,503
No a sheep

1049
00:59:37,343 --> 00:59:38,367
Time shutdown

1050
00:59:38,623 --> 00:59:39,903
Miles and just walked away

1051
00:59:40,415 --> 00:59:41,695
Because they know their sheep

1052
00:59:42,207 --> 00:59:42,975
What's a fraud

1053
00:59:43,487 --> 00:59:48,607
So when you lasted Alex or saying he pulled realize how complicated it is

1054
00:59:48,863 --> 00:59:51,679
And how the conversation tree requires the other person

1055
00:59:53,215 --> 00:59:55,775
Yeah your comeback to make sense

1056
00:59:59,615 --> 01:00:02,943
You're right

1057
01:00:03,199 --> 01:00:05,247
Conscious participant

1058
01:00:05,503 --> 01:00:09,599
To do the feed is literally like he has to be like okay

1059
01:00:09,855 --> 01:00:10,879
Yes

1060
01:00:12,415 --> 01:00:15,231
What's up wow

1061
01:00:15,487 --> 01:00:16,511
Wear mask

1062
01:00:18,559 --> 01:00:19,327
You're looking at me

1063
01:00:19,839 --> 01:00:21,119
What are you doing staring at me

1064
01:00:23,423 --> 01:00:25,471
I think you should wear a mask

1065
01:00:26,239 --> 01:00:29,823
You don't be mean to animals I don't know I don't understand what does that mean

1066
01:00:33,919 --> 01:00:37,247
Alright well I will

1067
01:00:37,503 --> 01:00:38,527
Alex

1068
01:00:38,783 --> 01:00:40,831
Talks a little bit here about

1069
01:00:41,087 --> 01:00:42,623
The Eurostar

1070
01:00:43,135 --> 01:00:44,159
That are being used

1071
01:00:44,415 --> 01:00:48,255
To justify

1072
01:00:48,511 --> 01:00:51,583
Ambient background violence of the communist

1073
01:00:53,887 --> 01:00:54,399
Activated

1074
01:00:55,167 --> 01:00:59,007
The overthrow of local government

1075
01:00:59,263 --> 01:01:01,567
Surrounding of the White House and attempt to drive the Press

1076
01:01:06,431 --> 01:01:07,455
We supposed to be God

1077
01:01:07,967 --> 01:01:10,015
From family members they got high level and even

1078
01:01:14,111 --> 01:01:15,135
Charles property

1079
01:01:15,391 --> 01:01:17,183
Lawsuits against

1080
01:01:17,439 --> 01:01:18,975
When we got the documents

1081
01:01:19,231 --> 01:01:21,279
Just one front guy

1082
01:01:21,535 --> 01:01:22,559
Your system

1083
01:01:22,815 --> 01:01:26,143
Talk to John about thesaurus documents being absolute fake

1084
01:01:31,263 --> 01:01:34,079
Because he knows that if he told the truth his story sounds stupid

1085
01:01:34,847 --> 01:01:37,919
You did not get them from a family member exclusively

1086
01:01:38,175 --> 01:01:40,479
Is employee Harrison Smith found them on Fortune

1087
01:01:40,991 --> 01:01:42,527
I watch the episode where Harrison

1088
01:01:42,783 --> 01:01:43,807
Shows them to Alex

1089
01:01:44,063 --> 01:01:46,367
It was explicit

1090
01:01:46,623 --> 01:01:48,671
About the original Anonymous poster

1091
01:01:48,927 --> 01:01:51,231
Playing but he found them in his brothers possession

1092
01:01:52,255 --> 01:01:57,375
His story sucks and there's literally no way to prove their authenticity of this is how we

1093
01:01:57,887 --> 01:01:58,399
So he lies

1094
01:01:58,911 --> 01:02:02,239
He claims he got them through a much more legitimate sounding means

1095
01:02:02,751 --> 01:02:05,823
Because it also

1096
01:02:06,079 --> 01:02:07,615
Unless transparently fake

1097
01:02:08,383 --> 01:02:08,895
Also

1098
01:02:09,151 --> 01:02:12,735
The alleged organization in those documents had nothing to do with Alexander Soros

1099
01:02:12,991 --> 01:02:15,295
It was a political action committee that was run by Soros

1100
01:02:17,343 --> 01:02:19,647
But as we discussed the last time you contract

1101
01:02:20,159 --> 01:02:23,487
That's what collection committee didn't even exist at the time of those documents are supposed to be

1102
01:02:23,743 --> 01:02:24,255
Created

1103
01:02:24,767 --> 01:02:28,095
In 30 seconds Alex's lied about how he got these fake document

1104
01:02:28,351 --> 01:02:30,143
Getting them exclusively

1105
01:02:30,655 --> 01:02:33,727
Made up that they relate to Alexander Soros

1106
01:02:33,983 --> 01:02:39,615
They're all his legal trouble is actually just retribution because he exclusively cover these fake.

1107
01:02:40,639 --> 01:02:46,783
All of the lawsuit against Alex they aren't the result of his own monstrous actions it's serious damages he's caused another people

1108
01:02:47,039 --> 01:02:50,111
Journalist

1109
01:02:50,367 --> 01:02:51,647
Daring to take on Soros

1110
01:02:52,159 --> 01:02:53,439
I believe one of them

1111
01:02:54,207 --> 01:02:55,743
You can

1112
01:02:56,255 --> 01:03:02,399
See here how the details of the story seems to conveniently fit the version of the story that Alex's narcissistic Eagle require

1113
01:03:03,423 --> 01:03:09,567
Alex knows what the documents are fake story so there's no reason not to weaponize it against is Imagine

1114
01:03:09,823 --> 01:03:14,943
Can use it to Gaslight is audience the victim in lawsuits

1115
01:03:15,199 --> 01:03:17,247
These lies terrorized

1116
01:03:17,759 --> 01:03:18,271

Thank you for a long time but I

1134
01:03:58,975 --> 01:04:01,279
Pure offense mode trying to stop this

1135
01:04:02,047 --> 01:04:04,863
Tell you that I agree with his analysis Aetna long-term

1136
01:04:06,399 --> 01:04:08,191
We can just mitigated.

1137
01:04:08,959 --> 01:04:09,983
Try to make sure

1138
01:04:16,895 --> 01:04:19,455
Chile

1139
01:04:19,711 --> 01:04:21,503
I had a bunch going to be coming

1140
01:04:23,551 --> 01:04:24,831
In the

1141
01:04:25,087 --> 01:04:26,879
Fourth hour today I'll become a state

1142
01:04:32,511 --> 01:04:35,583
I've never been more certain of anything in my life

1143
01:04:35,839 --> 01:04:36,351
Newspaper

1144
01:04:37,119 --> 01:04:39,423
This is broker contact

1145
01:04:39,679 --> 01:04:45,823
Location

1146
01:04:46,079 --> 01:04:47,871
Bug out to try to sell this book

1147
01:04:49,407 --> 01:04:52,223
I'm positive it's so over-the-top like

1148
01:04:52,479 --> 01:04:55,295
Alex just feeding the ground

1149
01:04:55,551 --> 01:05:01,695
Looks like this would be a good place to go but you got to understand there's going to be spillover from the

1150
01:05:03,743 --> 01:05:05,791
Whatever here's what we do

1151
01:05:06,303 --> 01:05:07,327
All right all of us

1152
01:05:08,095 --> 01:05:09,375
Present-day agree

1153
01:05:09,631 --> 01:05:10,143
On the left

1154
01:05:10,655 --> 01:05:13,727
We are going to act like this is going down

1155
01:05:14,495 --> 01:05:15,263
It's the day

1156
01:05:15,519 --> 01:05:16,287
We're doing

1157
01:05:16,799 --> 01:05:18,335
The contract will be fulfilled

1158
01:05:18,591 --> 01:05:20,127
We're doing the whole thing it's over

1159
01:05:20,383 --> 01:05:26,527
For Humanity all they got to do all they can do all the right-wing conservatives all the right

1160
01:05:28,063 --> 01:05:31,135
All they can do is go to the hills and hide

1161
01:05:31,391 --> 01:05:32,159
And wait it out

1162
01:05:32,671 --> 01:05:33,695
And while they're there

1163
01:05:34,207 --> 01:05:34,719
We

1164
01:05:35,999 --> 01:05:36,767
Do everything right

1165
01:05:37,023 --> 01:05:43,167
Just leave them there

1166
01:05:43,423 --> 01:05:43,935
Little Hut

1167
01:05:44,447 --> 01:05:48,799
Go go in there in the forest

1168
01:05:49,311 --> 01:05:49,823
But

1169
01:05:50,079 --> 01:05:51,103
You have an interesting idea

1170
01:05:51,359 --> 01:05:54,175
I think it's a good idea to trick them all into the forest

1171
01:05:54,431 --> 01:05:58,015
That was in the book plans for this sort of countermeasure but

1172
01:05:58,783 --> 01:06:03,647
Alex like

1173
01:06:03,903 --> 01:06:04,415
Is making

1174
01:06:04,671 --> 01:06:07,487
Some money from this is it

1175
01:06:07,743 --> 01:06:08,511
Lili contradict

1176
01:06:08,767 --> 01:06:09,535
It's Alex

1177
01:06:10,047 --> 01:06:12,095
Things with Alex should know as fact

1178
01:06:12,863 --> 01:06:14,143
Well as you know and we talked

1179
01:06:14,399 --> 01:06:18,751
Before the show there is a satanic Connection in the entire deep state

1180
01:06:19,263 --> 01:06:22,335
Gordy's things are done by Revelation and guidance at

1181
01:06:22,591 --> 01:06:23,359
The highest level

1182
01:06:24,383 --> 01:06:27,455
Intermediate yes-man the stupid idiots that letting used to call them

1183
01:06:27,967 --> 01:06:31,295
Just one of those useful idiots to the

1184
01:06:31,551 --> 01:06:34,623
Conspiracy

1185
01:06:35,391 --> 01:06:36,159
I don't think so

1186
01:06:36,415 --> 01:06:37,439
He said he's a lightweight

1187
01:06:37,951 --> 01:06:40,511
Scales and is presenting

1188
01:06:42,559 --> 01:06:44,351
Useful

1189
01:06:44,607 --> 01:06:47,679
Said repeatedly

1190
01:06:47,935 --> 01:06:54,079
The gates is part of the Council of twelve Duplantis

1191
01:06:55,359 --> 01:06:57,919
Yeah I am

1192
01:06:58,943 --> 01:06:59,711
Furious

1193
01:06:59,967 --> 01:07:00,479
We have

1194
01:07:00,735 --> 01:07:01,759
Spending months

1195
01:07:03,039 --> 01:07:09,183
Engage being the architect behind this whole thing and then Alex

1196
01:07:09,439 --> 01:07:11,743
This is just a thousand

1197
01:07:14,559 --> 01:07:17,375
Considers Joel skousen

1198
01:07:17,631 --> 01:07:21,215
Totally different

1199
01:07:21,727 --> 01:07:24,799
Just one of those useful idiots to the

1200
01:07:25,567 --> 01:07:28,383
To this conspiracy

1201
01:07:28,895 --> 01:07:32,223
I don't think so he's a lightweight when you look at it mentally

1202
01:07:32,991 --> 01:07:39,135
Yeah this is not a heavier

1203
01:07:39,647 --> 01:07:41,183
But as big now

1204
01:07:41,951 --> 01:07:44,767
What about the Rothschild

1205
01:07:45,535 --> 01:07:46,303
So Alex agreed

1206
01:07:52,447 --> 01:07:55,519
Bulshit I just can't

1207
01:07:55,775 --> 01:07:56,543
No

1208
01:07:56,799 --> 01:07:58,079
No that is unacceptable

1209
01:07:58,335 --> 01:08:00,383
Unacceptable

1210
01:08:00,639 --> 01:08:01,919
I agree

1211
01:08:03,199 --> 01:08:09,087
Do you think about the Rothschild are we just going to storm Alex's other coverage

1212
01:08:09,343 --> 01:08:11,391
You should not only not agree with this

1213
01:08:11,647 --> 01:08:12,159
You should say

1214
01:08:12,415 --> 01:08:13,439
Actually Joel

1215
01:08:13,695 --> 01:08:14,975
I have information

1216
01:08:15,231 --> 01:08:18,559
He's one of the 12 people who rule the planet

1217
01:08:18,815 --> 01:08:24,959
There are twelve of them

1218
01:08:25,215 --> 01:08:29,055
Are you saying that there's a council of three above

1219
01:08:29,311 --> 01:08:31,615
The Council of twelve such a stupid

1220
01:08:32,127 --> 01:08:34,175
Joel skousen

1221
01:08:37,247 --> 01:08:38,527
Oh okay

1222
01:08:39,295 --> 01:08:43,903
I don't care about like the long passages of like you should of

1223
01:08:45,695 --> 01:08:46,207
But I don't care

1224
01:08:46,463 --> 01:08:50,303
I'm not I'm not particularly concerned with his geographical analysis of the United States

1225
01:08:50,559 --> 01:08:56,703
I want a lot of people think the Central and South America via great place to go but that's only because they

1226
01:08:58,751 --> 01:09:04,895
Don't plan the bug out based on current circumstances I think that's a smart idea

1227
01:09:05,151 --> 01:09:07,199
Joel

1228
01:09:07,711 --> 01:09:10,271
Plan for the future are you sure

1229
01:09:10,783 --> 01:09:11,551
Here's the thing

1230
01:09:11,807 --> 01:09:13,343
Joel skousen

1231
01:09:15,391 --> 01:09:15,903
Because I think

1232
01:09:16,415 --> 01:09:16,927
Like

1233
01:09:17,439 --> 01:09:17,951
She thinks

1234
01:09:18,207 --> 01:09:19,743
He's fighting a literal devil

1235
01:09:20,255 --> 01:09:26,399
You don't put a lot of people get concerned about who is at the actually really doesn't matter who's at the

1236
01:09:26,655 --> 01:09:29,471
That's right

1237
01:09:29,983 --> 01:09:35,359
That's the only reason that could be going for centuries I mean service. Back of the only reason

1238
01:09:35,615 --> 01:09:39,711
No single evil person could set this in motion and keep it in motion

1239
01:09:39,967 --> 01:09:42,015
Exactly

1240
01:09:43,039 --> 01:09:43,551
Yes

1241
01:09:47,903 --> 01:09:54,047
The only way we can explain a centuries-old

1242
01:09:54,303 --> 01:10:00,447
Centuries ago yeah behind it

1243
01:10:00,703 --> 01:10:06,847
You making all that up

1244
01:10:07,359 --> 01:10:12,735
Explain it actually accidentally very legitimate argument that he made

1245
01:10:13,247 --> 01:10:19,391
The only way that we can explain our b******* is if the literal devil is real and controlling it

1246
01:10:19,903 --> 01:10:21,951
If those two things are not true

1247
01:10:22,463 --> 01:10:28,607
Everything we believe is b*******

1248
01:10:30,143 --> 01:10:32,959
Earlier Alex

1249
01:10:33,215 --> 01:10:34,239
You know you like

1250
01:10:34,495 --> 01:10:36,543
Call people sheep who wear masks

1251
01:10:38,079 --> 01:10:42,431
I might have

1252
01:10:42,687 --> 01:10:43,199
28

1253
01:10:43,455 --> 01:10:46,527
Just saw when he came out and said where your Masters patriotic

1254
01:10:47,039 --> 01:10:47,551
Donald Trump

1255
01:10:48,831 --> 01:10:51,135
From the folks I saw

1256
01:10:57,023 --> 01:11:02,911
Sounds a lot like sheep because he is their Authority

1257
01:11:03,167 --> 01:11:05,727
Would you say

1258
01:11:06,495 --> 01:11:07,263
Come on man

1259
01:11:15,967 --> 01:11:22,111
I'm not going to go to bat for it that Batman

1260
01:11:26,207 --> 01:11:32,351
Like I said the rest of this episode is 2,000 telling you where not to go in there

1261
01:11:32,607 --> 01:11:34,399
Whatever

1262
01:11:34,655 --> 01:11:35,423
Plenty of

1263
01:11:35,935 --> 01:11:37,215
Any City

1264
01:11:37,471 --> 01:11:39,007
All of China

1265
01:11:39,263 --> 01:11:41,823
Should you go to all of nowhere near

1266
01:11:42,079 --> 01:11:48,223
Spell Japan going to take all of those

1267
01:11:48,479 --> 01:11:49,247
Playing the game

1268
01:11:52,575 --> 01:11:55,647
Recruitment is not safe

1269
01:11:56,159 --> 01:12:02,303
God dammit

1270
01:12:02,559 --> 01:12:04,351
Some normal Wilson

1271
01:12:05,119 --> 01:12:06,911
I have news from Federal

1272
01:12:13,055 --> 01:12:15,103
Unfolding in front of you don't need the intelligence

1273
01:12:16,383 --> 01:12:17,151
From higher level

1274
01:12:17,919 --> 01:12:18,943
I feel the same thing

1275
01:12:20,735 --> 01:12:21,503
Are we

1276
01:12:22,015 --> 01:12:22,527
With

1277
01:12:23,039 --> 01:12:24,063
Tpd sources

1278
01:12:28,415 --> 01:12:29,439
Shinso in

1279
01:12:30,975 --> 01:12:31,487
We're doing this

1280
01:12:32,767 --> 01:12:33,535
The every morning

1281
01:12:35,839 --> 01:12:38,911
Broadcast

1282
01:12:41,983 --> 01:12:43,007
What I'm going to say about this

1283
01:12:44,287 --> 01:12:45,567
You do that pre-show

1284
01:12:48,127 --> 01:12:54,271
This is going to be Paul Revere level stuff is this

1285
01:12:54,527 --> 01:12:56,575
Same over and over

1286
01:12:57,343 --> 01:13:00,159
It's almost turning into the rake infect I was kind of laughing

1287
01:13:01,439 --> 01:13:03,487
It's like

1288
01:13:03,743 --> 01:13:09,887
Funnier than is b b he does with masks

1289
01:13:12,191 --> 01:13:13,471
He doesn't actually wait

1290
01:13:13,727 --> 01:13:16,287
He does tells what the story is

1291
01:13:19,615 --> 01:13:22,431
But I can tell you what we already knew

1292
01:13:22,687 --> 01:13:24,223
But it's totally confirm now

1293
01:13:25,759 --> 01:13:29,343
Soros deep State Obama controlled Hillary control

1294
01:13:31,903 --> 01:13:33,695
Will be the decoys

1295

There is a real feeling of that like

1352
01:16:42,623 --> 01:16:44,927
The people who paid

1353
01:16:45,183 --> 01:16:46,975
The price of the past

1354
01:16:51,583 --> 01:16:54,655

It made it pretty clear.

1359
01:17:07,711 --> 01:17:08,479
In the moron

01:17:11,551 --> 01:17:12,575
In the fulcrum

1362
01:17:18,719 --> 01:17:20,255
I know you are the fulcrum as well

1363
01:17:20,511 --> 01:17:21,279
That's why you're here

1364
01:17:22,303 --> 01:17:23,071

01:17:43,807 --> 01:17:47,647
What a much easier chance down the road to go through this AI challenging

1372
01:17:50,719 --> 01:17:51,231
More than

1373
01:17:53,535 --> 01:17:54,559
Now that sounds like a lot

1374
01:17:59,423 --> 01:17:59,935
Projector

1375
01:18:07,615 --> 01:18:09,663

We'll be lucky

1378
01:18:19,903 --> 01:18:22,719
I didn't want to step on Alex's estimate

1379
01:18:22,975 --> 01:18:24,511
What I was

1380
01:18:28,863 --> 01:18:33,727
The more I know I'm relevant

1381
01:18:33,983 --> 01:18:35,519
I'm so important

1382
01:18:36,031 --> 01:18:38,591
It has to be related to last night's

1383
01:18:38,847 --> 01:18:43,455
Look at all the attention

1384
01:18:43,711 --> 01:18:49,855

01:18:50,111 --> 01:18:53,951
Common destroy the globalists

1386
01:18:54,719 --> 01:18:58,047
It's like Trump

1387
01:18:58,559 --> 01:19:00,351

How do you like

1394
01:19:13,663 --> 01:19:17,503
Does a little bit more dangerous about this

1395
01:19:24,159 --> 01:19:27,231
Making a little bit more explicit basically

1396
01:19:27,743 --> 01:19:30,559
The protest that you're seeing in in cities like Portland

1397
01:19:31,839 --> 01:19:32,351

You win stage riots long way to get there

1399
01:19:39,519 --> 01:19:40,031

More rioting

1405
01:19:55,647 --> 01:19:59,999
With the Democrats to remove Trump and they're announcing that they're playing

1406
01:20:01,535 --> 01:20:03,583
Have we gotten them to come out of the open

Un stage riots

1419
01:21:00,672 --> 01:21:01,696
Is really not good

1420
01:21:02,208 --> 01:21:02,976
Because

1421
01:21:03,232 --> 01:21:05,536
Alex has built up years and years of

1422
01:21:06,304 --> 01:21:06,816
Argument

1423
01:21:07,072 --> 01:21:08,096
About what you do

1424
01:21:08,352 --> 01:21:09,632
When you when troops

1425
01:21:16,288 --> 01:21:22,432
I said protest

1426
01:21:22,688 --> 01:21:23,968
Even though I look at

1427
01:21:24,224 --> 01:21:28,064
And I actually live there and I see the people and I know that person

1428
01:21:28,320 --> 01:21:30,624
It turns out they were hired by the UN

1429
01:21:31,136 --> 01:21:34,976
So I don't know if you realize that he's already

1430
01:21:35,232 --> 01:21:39,840
The story about MS-13 and Chinese hit teams coming to kill Patriot leaders

1431
01:21:40,096 --> 01:21:43,936
Does he continues trying to tease the story as if he hasn't already talked about

1432
01:21:44,704 --> 01:21:48,800
I have this from the APT I have the former State Police I have is from a governor's office

It makes me physically sick to my stomach

1442
01:22:17,216 --> 01:22:19,776
To realize the situation

1443
01:22:20,032 --> 01:22:24,896
You already told the story you don't really have much else to add to it except for like maybe some

1444

The only proof that he provides

1450
01:22:38,208 --> 01:22:39,232
It doesn't prove any

1451
01:22:39,488 --> 01:22:41,536
The things that he saying

1452

1484
01:24:20,096 --> 01:24:22,400
They got stolen trucks they're going to load them up with gas

1485
01:24:23,424 --> 01:24:24,192
And I just got up

1486
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:26,496
Run your household

1487
01:24:28,032 --> 01:24:29,056
Come out they're going to shoot you

1488
01:24:30,848 --> 01:24:31,616
Capitals

1489
01:24:34,176 --> 01:24:37,504
Yeah so that's keep your item with a bet

1490
01:24:38,016 --> 01:24:40,320
Can you keep your eyes open for car bomb

1491
01:24:40,576 --> 01:24:41,600
Sands

1492
01:24:41,856 --> 01:24:42,624
Stage tooting

1493
01:24:51,840 --> 01:24:52,864
Operation against the party

1494
01:24:59,520 --> 01:25:00,032
Find ghost

1495
01:25:00,544 --> 01:25:03,104
I so weak that when they do this

1496
01:25:07,200 --> 01:25:07,968
Got plans

1497
01:25:10,016 --> 01:25:11,808
Go to conservative universities and

1498
01:25:12,576 --> 01:25:15,136
Dump

1499
01:25:15,392 --> 01:25:16,928
Sure

1500
01:25:26,144 --> 01:25:27,424
America's Best

1501
01:25:31,264 --> 01:25:33,568
But I don't think these idiots that are part of this

1502
01:25:34,336 --> 01:25:35,872
In this communist operation with Eliza

1503
01:25:37,920 --> 01:25:38,944
Their bosses

1504
01:25:39,456 --> 01:25:39,968
Target

1505
01:25:42,272 --> 01:25:42,784
My

1506
01:25:44,320 --> 01:25:45,088
That's nice of you

1507
01:25:47,648 --> 01:25:48,416
Thanks buddy

1508
01:25:50,720 --> 01:25:51,232
Okay

1509
01:25:51,488 --> 01:25:52,768
The story that he's already

1510
01:25:53,280 --> 01:25:54,304
Right

1511
01:26:01,472 --> 01:26:03,776
Leader of all

1512
01:26:04,032 --> 01:26:04,800
Tomorrow Alex

1513
01:26:05,056 --> 01:26:11,200
Go to your bunker now as far away from the rest of the human race as you can so I don't think Alex has any

1514
01:26:11,456 --> 01:26:15,040
He's basing the song that is what I would call realities

1515
01:26:15,552 --> 01:26:21,184
Misrepresenting has to sort of

1516
01:26:21,440 --> 01:26:22,208
A little bit of

1517
01:26:22,720 --> 01:26:24,256
A garnish to the story

1518
01:26:24,512 --> 01:26:29,120
They are escalating violent confrontation to set the precedent with everyone

1519
01:26:29,376 --> 01:26:32,704
Buildings down to shoot cops and they hadn't random citizen

1520
01:26:33,216 --> 01:26:33,984
City of Austin

1521
01:26:34,496 --> 01:26:35,520
Has the new budget

1522
01:26:37,568 --> 01:26:38,336
Calls for

1523
01:26:39,104 --> 01:26:40,128
Blowing up

1524
01:26:44,992 --> 01:26:45,760
To blow up

1525
01:26:46,784 --> 01:26:47,808
The police

1526
01:26:48,064 --> 01:26:48,832
Department

1527
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:51,136
As a symbol of evil

1528
01:26:52,160 --> 01:26:53,184
To make police then

1529
01:26:53,440 --> 01:26:57,024
Inside other agencies under other bureaucrats control

1530
01:27:01,632 --> 01:27:05,472
So you can you can talk about this all day long Legends understand

1531
01:27:05,984 --> 01:27:07,264
This is the Takeover

1532
01:27:07,776 --> 01:27:08,800
This is a complete

1533
01:27:09,056 --> 01:27:10,336
Easily demonstrable

1534
01:27:10,848 --> 01:27:14,944
The real story here is that one of the Austin city council members Jimmy Flanagan

1535
01:27:15,200 --> 01:27:18,016
Forwarded

1536
01:27:18,272 --> 01:27:22,368
Florida proposal is part of the process of putting together the budget

1537
01:27:23,648 --> 01:27:24,160
Please start

1538
01:27:25,184 --> 01:27:29,024
Police Department in 25 restructure Department

1539
01:27:29,280 --> 01:27:34,144
Specific mission that leadership as opposed to it all being under one executive

1540
01:27:34,656 --> 01:27:40,800
Great technology in 911

1541
01:27:41,056 --> 01:27:42,336
Forensics and record-keeping

1542
01:27:43,104 --> 01:27:47,456
Investigations in traffic safety those three are all self-explanatory

1543
01:27:47,712 --> 01:27:50,528
Another Department of Professional Standards would handle

1544
01:27:50,784 --> 01:27:51,552
Internal affairs

1545
01:27:53,088 --> 01:27:57,952
As part of The Proposal which would see these responsibilities handled by more separate entities

1546
01:27:58,208 --> 01:27:58,976
There was an idea

1547
01:27:59,232 --> 01:28:00,512
Decentralize their offices

1548
01:28:00,768 --> 01:28:02,816
It's from the current building their house

1549
01:28:03,584 --> 01:28:06,656
One issue that I was ignoring here is very Twisted in The Proposal

1550
01:28:06,912 --> 01:28:13,056
The building that houses APD headquarters and formerly housed the Municipal Court as long

1551
01:28:13,312 --> 01:28:15,104
Beyond the end of its useful life

1552
01:28:15,616 --> 01:28:18,432
We should expedite the demolition of the LAPD headquarters

1553
01:28:18,944 --> 01:28:22,784
By directing the city manager to move all remaining APD staff

1554
01:28:23,040 --> 01:28:24,064
Existing headquarters building

1555
01:28:24,320 --> 01:28:26,112
Any other underutilized

1556
01:28:26,368 --> 01:28:27,648
City facility

1557
01:28:28,416 --> 01:28:32,768
It's an old building on very valuable real estate which could be better use

1558
01:28:33,280 --> 01:28:36,096
It's a city demolish the existing building and move the new police

1559
01:28:36,352 --> 01:28:38,400
East Apartments to existing city office space

1560
01:28:38,912 --> 01:28:41,216
Could be better used to serve the community

1561
01:28:41,728 --> 01:28:43,520
It's really a win-win although all around

1562
01:28:43,776 --> 01:28:44,800
Yeah that's great idea

1563
01:28:45,056 --> 01:28:45,568
But it's also

1564
01:28:45,824 --> 01:28:47,616
Recognize that this is all just still up

1565
01:28:47,872 --> 01:28:48,384
Proposal

1566
01:28:49,152 --> 01:28:51,456
Element of Alex's reporting

1567
01:28:51,712 --> 01:28:52,224
Why

1568
01:28:52,480 --> 01:28:58,624
He's claiming that this is officially the Austin city budget that they plan to blow up the police department or some kind of virtue

1569
01:28:58,880 --> 01:28:59,648
Signal

1570
01:29:01,696 --> 01:29:03,232
Figuratively a complete lie

1571
01:29:03,744 --> 01:29:07,072
Article in KVUE

1572
01:29:08,096 --> 01:29:09,632
Police Department budget

1573
01:29:10,144 --> 01:29:13,216
Yet Alex is Huron are saying it's official and certified by the mayor

1574
01:29:13,728 --> 01:29:14,752
Lies all the time

1575
01:29:15,264 --> 01:29:16,288
Is just making stuff up

1576
01:29:16,544 --> 01:29:17,056
Bummer

1577
01:29:17,312 --> 01:29:17,824
Yep

1578
01:29:18,336 --> 01:29:18,848
What an a******

1579
01:29:20,384 --> 01:29:24,736
He hasn't told his story about these hit teams coming to kill conservatives

1580
01:29:24,992 --> 01:29:26,272
Because he's still teasing

1581
01:29:27,808 --> 01:29:29,600
What's coming up next hour

1582
01:29:31,392 --> 01:29:32,672
Is the Paul Revere

1583
01:29:32,928 --> 01:29:33,952
Signal being fired up

1584
01:29:35,488 --> 01:29:36,000
This is it

1585
01:29:38,304 --> 01:29:39,072
Units

1586
01:29:39,584 --> 01:29:40,864
They're not just lazing targets

1587
01:29:42,656 --> 01:29:43,168
Going

1588
01:29:43,680 --> 01:29:44,704
The judges homes

1589
01:29:45,728 --> 01:29:46,752
Play Psalms

1590
01:29:47,264 --> 01:29:49,312
Talk show host Tom's members of Congress on

1591
01:29:50,336 --> 01:29:50,848
Preparing

1592
01:29:51,104 --> 01:29:51,872
The groups

1593
01:29:52,384 --> 01:29:55,712
Center going to go in and down those places than they're going to have actual

1594
01:29:55,968 --> 01:29:58,528
Professionals that kill the judges in place

1595
01:29:58,784 --> 01:30:00,320
Hanging out to dry

1596
01:30:00,576 --> 01:30:03,136
Course

1597
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:08,768
I think that's great

1598
01:30:09,280 --> 01:30:10,048
These global

1599
01:30:11,840 --> 01:30:12,352
Have

1600
01:30:12,864 --> 01:30:13,888
Brilliant plans

1601
01:30:14,144 --> 01:30:18,496
Yep unfortunately even by our own measure those since none of them have

1602
01:30:18,752 --> 01:30:19,520
Actually work

1603
01:30:20,288 --> 01:30:23,104
I think the globalists are an ineffective in pointless organization

1604
01:30:23,360 --> 01:30:26,688
Alex

1605
01:30:26,944 --> 01:30:30,272
Portrays them bear the geopolitical mr. Magoo

1606
01:30:33,344 --> 01:30:33,856
Comical

1607
01:30:39,744 --> 01:30:45,632
Baby Ariel and the training baby l or maybe they mentioned both of them

1608
01:30:46,144 --> 01:30:48,448
Clip the training for Police Department

1609
01:30:48,704 --> 01:30:49,472
Surrounding

1610
01:30:49,728 --> 01:30:51,776
Either of their activities

1611
01:30:52,800 --> 01:30:53,568
Have woken up

1612
01:30:53,824 --> 01:30:54,336
Police Department

1613
01:30:54,848 --> 01:30:55,616
Because

1614
01:30:55,872 --> 01:30:59,712
The ADI was apparently trying to buy all the police chief's hookers

1615
01:31:00,224 --> 01:31:00,736
Or something

1616
01:31:00,992 --> 01:31:01,760
Now that's

1617
01:31:02,016 --> 01:31:02,528
Interesting

1618
01:31:04,064 --> 01:31:09,952
What's more interesting is that Alex starts rambling and talking about people who tried to buy him off

1619
01:31:10,208 --> 01:31:11,488
Over the course of his career

1620
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:13,280
Police state plan

1621
01:31:13,536 --> 01:31:16,096
Military

1622
01:31:16,352 --> 01:31:19,168
Training

1623
01:31:19,424 --> 01:31:22,240
Did more than Alex Jones

1624
01:31:29,664 --> 01:31:32,992
Something about you

1625
01:31:33,504 --> 01:31:35,808
You're making this up

1626
01:31:36,064 --> 01:31:38,880
What the hell is this true we're not doing that

1627
01:31:39,136 --> 01:31:42,976
Educated and now there's another one enemy cuz I told you

1628
01:31:43,232 --> 01:31:46,048
The most group in the country is the police

1629
01:31:47,584 --> 01:31:51,424
Because they get taken to ATL and Southern Poverty Law Center events

1630
01:31:52,960 --> 01:31:53,984
And the captains

1631
01:31:54,240 --> 01:31:55,264
What are they saying

1632
01:31:58,592 --> 01:32:01,920
We got a business for you and it's actually Mafia

1633
01:32:02,176 --> 01:32:03,456
Has a criminal act

1634
01:32:08,576 --> 01:32:10,880
Resetting

1635
01:32:11,904 --> 01:32:12,928
And next to top sirloin

1636
01:32:13,952 --> 01:32:14,720
You're offering me a hook

1637
01:32:16,768 --> 01:32:17,792
Driver seat of my life

1638
01:32:18,816 --> 01:32:20,096
And almost all the cops

1639
01:32:20,352 --> 01:32:20,864
Refuse

1640
01:32:21,120 --> 01:32:25,472
So this is weird Alex is claiming that the splc tried to buy him off

1641
01:32:25,728 --> 01:32:31,104
Cuz I don't believe in any of that

1642
01:32:32,128 --> 01:32:32,640
Alex

1643
01:32:34,432 --> 01:32:37,504
Talkin about

1644
01:32:38,272 --> 01:32:39,040
How

1645
01:32:40,320 --> 01:32:42,624
He might have been approached by some Russian

1646
01:32:43,136 --> 01:32:44,160
With

1647
01:32:44,416 --> 01:32:44,928
Some money

1648
01:32:45,696 --> 01:32:47,488
Just like they had them in the Russia investigation

1649
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:49,792
They couldn't get one American

1650
01:32:50,048 --> 01:32:51,840
Over 2,000 people including me

1651
01:32:53,632 --> 01:32:54,656
They couldn't get

1652
01:32:54,912 --> 01:32:56,192
One American

1653
01:32:56,704 --> 01:32:58,240
Money course it wasn't

1654
01:32:59,776 --> 01:33:00,288
So

1655
01:33:00,800 --> 01:33:04,640
I don't believe that this story is it all true

1656
01:33:04,896 --> 01:33:06,944
Truth-telling

1657
01:33:11,296 --> 01:33:12,320
He's

1658
01:33:12,576 --> 01:33:16,928
Approached and offered buddy

1659
01:33:17,184 --> 01:33:20,000
Yes

1660
01:33:20,512 --> 01:33:21,280
Now then

1661
01:33:21,792 --> 01:33:23,584
Let me let me toss this out

1662
01:33:23,840 --> 01:33:27,168
Did you report this to the FBI

1663
01:33:27,936 --> 01:33:31,520
So there is Alex's

1664
01:33:31,776 --> 01:33:32,288
Telling

1665
01:33:33,568 --> 01:33:38,432
Spit the Russians interfered with the election Dan or were attempting to Italy

1666
01:33:39,712 --> 01:33:45,856
So that whole Russia hoax Alex's accidentally got it all backwards

1667
01:33:46,112 --> 01:33:47,392
Because they were secretly

1668
01:33:47,648 --> 01:33:49,440
What okay fine then the globalist

1669
01:33:49,696 --> 01:33:50,720
Secretly

1670
01:33:54,816 --> 01:33:57,888
They'd still need somebody interfere with the election in trumps

1671
01:33:58,144 --> 01:34:04,288
Favorite setup

1672
01:34:04,544 --> 01:34:10,688
I hate living in this space

1673
01:34:12,224 --> 01:34:18,112
You saying is accurate I think he's just in a little bit of episode because

1674
01:34:18,368 --> 01:34:24,512
He had this adrenaline boost and all that juice from

1675
01:34:24,768 --> 01:34:28,608
I must be so right

1676
01:34:28,864 --> 01:34:32,192
Because people are attacking me feel so good

1677
01:34:35,264 --> 01:34:38,848
What's going on

1678
01:34:40,896 --> 01:34:41,920
Nowhere throat

1679
01:34:42,176 --> 01:34:43,968
Raccoons and it's not the Russians

1680
01:34:45,504 --> 01:34:46,016
You people

1681
01:34:48,576 --> 01:34:50,112
Laptops with epoxy

1682
01:34:50,624 --> 01:34:51,904
Because you spiritually Arbor

1683
01:34:52,160 --> 01:34:53,184
Why did you gave up your

1684
01:34:54,208 --> 01:34:54,720
Birthright

1685
01:34:54,976 --> 01:34:56,256
For nothing

1686
01:34:59,072 --> 01:34:59,840
Disgusting

1687
01:35:00,352 --> 01:35:03,168
You're like a rotting dead animal in the sun with Matt

1688
01:35:05,984 --> 01:35:09,568
You just want to force your way on us and rape us with your back scene

1689
01:35:10,336 --> 01:35:11,872
Toxic culture

1690
01:35:12,128 --> 01:35:15,200
Pedophilia and all of it and we're runs ejected

1691
01:35:17,760 --> 01:35:22,112
Do everything

1692
01:35:34,144 --> 01:35:35,168
Because when you're done

1693
01:35:36,704 --> 01:35:37,472
When you're out of breath

1694
01:35:41,056 --> 01:35:42,592
He said the only way we're settlers were both

1695
01:35:43,872 --> 01:35:47,712

Ghost brake there any comes back

And the baby

1699
01:35:57,440 --> 01:35:58,976

Even organizing and preparing

1719
01:37:10,656 --> 01:37:13,216

Too much enter to Gunn

1728
01:37:45,216 --> 01:37:46,496
By that I mean they're just

1729
01:37:47,520 --> 01:37:48,288
What are you talkin about

1730
01:37:48,800 --> 01:37:54,176
Basically so yeah yeah

1731
01:37:54,688 --> 01:37:56,480
He still seems to be

1732
01:37:56,736 --> 01:38:00,576
Acting like he thinks that he hasn't already told this story

1733
01:38:00,832 --> 01:38:02,880
He's talked about it quite a bit

1734
01:38:08,256 --> 01:38:10,048
I'm allowed to take those we come back on

1735
01:38:11,584 --> 01:38:14,912
Lightest horse vaccine World Government World by dinos

1736
01:38:19,264 --> 01:38:19,776
Layout

1737
01:38:20,800 --> 01:38:22,080
I just really mad at myself right

1738
01:38:25,408 --> 01:38:27,712
I just don't know how to describe this because it's so real

1739
01:38:30,272 --> 01:38:34,112
Understanding

1740
01:38:34,368 --> 01:38:35,648
Logical Warfare

1741
01:38:36,416 --> 01:38:36,928
So

1742
01:38:37,952 --> 01:38:44,096
I mean is the story that eventually gets to like

1743
01:38:44,352 --> 01:38:47,168
He's teasing he's teasing somebody's already talked about

1744
01:38:47,424 --> 01:38:47,936
As if

1745
01:38:48,192 --> 01:38:54,336
I really feel insane

1746
01:38:54,592 --> 01:38:55,104
You crazy

1747
01:38:55,360 --> 01:38:56,384
Still trying to

1748
01:38:56,896 --> 01:38:58,176
Is this

1749
01:39:00,992 --> 01:39:05,088
I think that he thinks that maybe people will think there's another story, but isn't

1750
01:39:07,648 --> 01:39:09,952
We have these shows they're in the middle of a zygote

1751
01:39:10,464 --> 01:39:12,000
Has the most insane ever

1752
01:39:16,352 --> 01:39:17,376
It's a form of

1753
01:39:19,424 --> 01:39:20,192
Laser welder

1754
01:39:20,960 --> 01:39:21,728
Shiting it's itchy

1755
01:39:23,264 --> 01:39:23,776
Incompetent

1756
01:39:25,056 --> 01:39:25,824
Front of me

Class A license already

1758
01:39:35,040 --> 01:39:37,344
Would give them the keys understanding all the other Shore

1759
01:39:42,976 --> 01:39:45,280

01:39:48,096 --> 01:39:48,608
Is the

1761
01:39:49,376 --> 01:39:55,520
I am Alex Jones very serious political I speak in riddles

1762
01:39:56,800 --> 01:39:58,848
Remember When

1763
01:39:59,104 --> 01:40:03,712
Walter Cronkite would get on air and tell you some kind of a riddle

1764
01:40:05,504 --> 01:40:08,576
Cannot grasp

1765
01:40:08,832 --> 01:40:11,392
But looking at where I'm going is the fools

1766
01:40:11,648 --> 01:40:17,792
Good night good luck and weaknesses strengths

1767
01:40:18,560 --> 01:40:19,328
Sure.

1768
01:40:20,096 --> 01:40:22,912
So you want to talk about

1769
01:40:23,168 --> 01:40:23,680
He's gone

1770
01:40:26,240 --> 01:40:26,752
You don't need to

1771
01:40:27,520 --> 01:40:29,056
God God will help you break

1772
01:40:29,312 --> 01:40:30,080
Next song

1773
01:40:30,592 --> 01:40:32,384
50 caliber rifle

1774
01:40:33,920 --> 01:40:34,944
That's not my real power

1775
01:40:36,480 --> 01:40:38,272
Did you know with my bare hands

1776
01:40:38,528 --> 01:40:39,296
Actiontec any

1777
01:40:39,552 --> 01:40:40,064
Weapon

1778
01:40:42,880 --> 01:40:43,648
Read the will

1779
01:40:44,672 --> 01:40:46,720
I can break any man's neck

1780
01:40:47,488 --> 01:40:48,000
Okay

1781
01:40:50,048 --> 01:40:51,072
In the service of God

1782
01:41:01,568 --> 01:41:03,616
Cannot be resisted even destroyed

1783
01:41:06,688 --> 01:41:07,712
Need these

1784
01:41:09,760 --> 01:41:10,784
Haitian I have the spirit

1785
01:41:15,648 --> 01:41:17,184
Nuclear weapons

1786
01:41:31,008 --> 01:41:32,544
That's upsetting

1787
01:41:35,616 --> 01:41:36,128
Now

1788
01:41:36,384 --> 01:41:38,432
Somebody's had a mannequin

1789
01:41:40,736 --> 01:41:42,016
Claiming

1790
01:41:42,528 --> 01:41:48,672
Certain powers that may be Beyond you

1791
01:41:48,928 --> 01:41:52,000
Through Christ you can take nukes

1792
01:41:53,536 --> 01:41:55,072
I'm just going to throw this out

1793
01:41:55,328 --> 01:41:57,888
Okay now is our long-range

1794
01:41:58,400 --> 01:42:00,192
True that is the point of

1795
01:42:05,824 --> 01:42:07,616
Maybe I should stay away from the fence

1796
01:42:08,384 --> 01:42:09,408
Ya-Ya sisterhood

1797
01:42:09,664 --> 01:42:10,432
Much shorter

1798
01:42:10,688 --> 01:42:11,200
Reyes

1799
01:42:11,456 --> 01:42:17,600
Understanding why we have guns

1800
01:42:17,856 --> 01:42:19,392
Okay she doesn't need ammo you can break your neck

1801
01:42:19,648 --> 01:42:22,720
Stay away away from him

1802
01:42:22,976 --> 01:42:25,280
Got to help breaking up

1803
01:42:25,536 --> 01:42:30,400
So Alex continues to tease the story that he's already told

1804
01:42:31,424 --> 01:42:34,496
I'm not building suspense you're holding up covering this news

1805
01:42:36,288 --> 01:42:37,056
Well actually no

1806
01:42:37,312 --> 01:42:37,824
You're not

1807
01:42:39,872 --> 01:42:41,408
Drum rolls or

1808
01:42:42,944 --> 01:42:44,480
Another thing to do to build

1809
01:42:44,736 --> 01:42:46,272
Just because

1810
01:42:47,808 --> 01:42:48,832
That's a globalist

1811
01:42:49,344 --> 01:42:51,392
So much this

1812
01:42:51,648 --> 01:42:52,928
Info so much stuff going on

1813
01:42:55,488 --> 01:42:56,000
That

1814
01:42:59,584 --> 01:43:02,400
When you actually bring out the huge information

1815
01:43:02,912 --> 01:43:04,192
It just Fizzles out

1816
01:43:06,240 --> 01:43:06,752
Doesn't matter

1817
01:43:07,264 --> 01:43:08,032
That sounds like you

1818
01:43:08,544 --> 01:43:09,568
Yeah does

1819
01:43:09,824 --> 01:43:11,104
From Deep research

1820
01:43:12,640 --> 01:43:13,664
Credible sources

1821
01:43:15,968 --> 01:43:17,248
Experiencing it myself

1822
01:43:18,784 --> 01:43:20,064
Exactly what's going on I mean

1823
01:43:20,320 --> 01:43:21,856
I know more about this topic

1824
01:43:24,672 --> 01:43:25,696
Position of

1825
01:43:26,208 --> 01:43:27,232
Power Trip

1826
01:43:31,584 --> 01:43:32,608
You can probably imagine

1827
01:43:33,120 --> 01:43:34,144
Cuz you're making it all up

1828
01:43:34,656 --> 01:43:35,168
Anyway

1829
01:43:35,424 --> 01:43:36,192
Still building this

1830
01:43:36,448 --> 01:43:42,336
Your response

1831
01:43:42,592 --> 01:43:45,920
Roller like skylight

1832
01:43:48,736 --> 01:43:49,504
Alright Alex

1833
01:43:53,088 --> 01:43:53,856
Ali Baba's

1834
01:43:54,112 --> 01:44:00,256
I use these things like a spotlights in order to build up suspense

1835
01:44:00,512 --> 01:44:03,072
Sit here the Pelicans

1836
01:44:06,400 --> 01:44:09,984
When is next Cliff Alex is telling his audience to create kill list

1837
01:44:11,776 --> 01:44:17,920
If you pay attention to the types of people that might qualify for it

1838
01:44:18,176 --> 01:44:18,944
Could make sense

1839
01:44:19,200 --> 01:44:23,296
Saying is make a list of people who are out protesting

1840
01:44:23,552 --> 01:44:24,320
Because

1841
01:44:24,576 --> 01:44:26,368
They are essentially the UN troops

1842
01:44:26,624 --> 01:44:28,160
Slitter trying to overthrow the country

1843
01:44:33,792 --> 01:44:35,072
But if they want to kill us

1844
01:44:35,328 --> 01:44:36,352
The best thing to do

1845
01:44:44,288 --> 01:44:45,824
I don't want

1846
01:44:46,080 --> 01:44:46,592
I'm not going to

1847
01:44:47,616 --> 01:44:48,128
Okay

1848
01:44:48,640 --> 01:44:51,456
Everybody likes Santa Claus to take

1849
01:44:51,968 --> 01:44:52,992
While we're here

1850
01:44:54,528 --> 01:44:56,064
Think about the future

1851
01:44:56,576 --> 01:44:58,880
Did they take down your country they destroy your bank account

1852
01:44:59,392 --> 01:45:00,928
A bunch of patriot leaders

1853
01:45:01,696 --> 01:45:02,464
What are you going to do

1854
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:08,096
Cuz you always talked about when the new world order came in and when the you ended this

1855
01:45:08,352 --> 01:45:10,144
You want to go out to shoot those two blue almond

1856
01:45:10,400 --> 01:45:11,680
Helmet

1857
01:45:16,800 --> 01:45:18,336
And once they get control your police

1858
01:45:18,592 --> 01:45:20,384
Those officers are program robots now

1859
01:45:20,640 --> 01:45:22,176
They'll follow orders for you

1860
01:45:22,432 --> 01:45:24,480
So anybody who I approached

1861
01:45:24,736 --> 01:45:30,880
In black or whatever is basically you and worker and a blue helmets

1862
01:45:31,136 --> 01:45:31,904
You should make a list

1863
01:45:32,160 --> 01:45:33,696
Who's really f****** dangerous

1864
01:45:33,952 --> 01:45:40,096
I wish that was in the Frontline documentary Alex is a f******

1865
01:45:40,608 --> 01:45:43,680
Like that is literal

1866
01:45:43,936 --> 01:45:50,080
I don't want to fight an offensive but I've created a fake one to fight a defensive War again

1867
01:45:50,336 --> 01:45:56,480
Created an artificial justification for all potential violence

1868
01:45:56,736 --> 01:45:57,760
And if you lose

1869
01:45:58,016 --> 01:46:03,136
Is any number it like hey if your 401k goes down because of I guess

1870
01:46:03,392 --> 01:46:09,536
Leftist mismanaging the covid issues

1871
01:46:09,792 --> 01:46:11,840
Which by the way

1872
01:46:12,096 --> 01:46:17,728
Happens to be everyone I disagree with but

1873
01:46:19,776 --> 01:46:20,544
I mean it is important

1874
01:46:20,800 --> 01:46:21,824
If we're going to play a clip like

1875
01:46:22,336 --> 01:46:24,128
We should probably play the follow up today

1876
01:46:27,712 --> 01:46:28,992
But the enemy is not

1877
01:46:29,248 --> 01:46:30,272
Loser

1878
01:46:30,528 --> 01:46:32,320
Method playing video games

1879
01:46:32,576 --> 01:46:35,136
That is told by the media given hundred dollars baby.

1880
01:46:35,392 --> 01:46:37,184
They're not the target you do not

1881
01:46:37,952 --> 01:46:38,464
Killing them

1882
01:46:41,024 --> 01:46:42,560
I don't want you to kill anybody right now

1883
01:46:43,584 --> 01:46:45,888
Right now

1884
01:46:46,400 --> 01:46:47,168
At what time 9

1885
01:46:48,448 --> 01:46:50,496
Free single globalist New World Order operative

1886
01:46:51,008 --> 01:46:53,312
An executive-level isn't anime combat

1887
01:46:53,568 --> 01:46:54,336
Humanity

1888
01:46:56,128 --> 01:46:58,176
Once they pull the trigger with their dick

1889
01:47:03,808 --> 01:47:04,576
Now's not the time

1890
01:47:07,648 --> 01:47:08,416
You'll know the time

1891
01:47:09,440 --> 01:47:09,952
And

1892
01:47:10,464 --> 01:47:12,256
This is the real world this isn't about

1893
01:47:13,792 --> 01:47:14,816
This is

1894
01:47:16,096 --> 01:47:16,864
Dark

1895
01:47:18,400 --> 01:47:19,936
Dark

1896
01:47:20,192 --> 01:47:21,472
Straight up

1897
01:47:21,728 --> 01:47:27,360
CBS does a report on Alex

1898
01:47:27,616 --> 01:47:30,944
Leftist

1899
01:47:31,200 --> 01:47:37,344
Really does because he's getting all this energy to go out

1900
01:47:37,600 --> 01:47:43,744
The Blaze of Glory all of these people paying attention to them look at me as I

1901
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:49,632
Explode into the stratosphere doesn't want to report losing in court

1902
01:47:49,888 --> 01:47:53,728
Yeah yeah yeah

1903
01:47:53,984 --> 01:48:00,128
If more satisfying as a narrative story

1904
01:48:04,224 --> 01:48:05,760
Exactly so

1905
01:48:06,272 --> 01:48:09,856
That's somebody who yells all the time about how much he loves God

1906
01:48:10,112 --> 01:48:11,648
Interesting Lee Alex

1907
01:48:11,904 --> 01:48:15,488
At this point the episode starts talking about how I'm going to save this

1908
01:48:17,792 --> 01:48:18,816
Have to stop

1909
01:48:19,072 --> 01:48:21,632
Sitting back and letting other towers that could Our Lives

1910
01:48:22,144 --> 01:48:23,168
Shut up

1911
01:48:23,680 --> 01:48:24,192
Person

1912
01:48:24,448 --> 01:48:25,216
Comes down

1913
01:48:25,728 --> 01:48:26,496
Taurus

1914
01:48:28,032 --> 01:48:28,544
No

1915
01:48:30,592 --> 01:48:31,360
Everything we have

1916
01:48:31,616 --> 01:48:32,640
Motorboat

1917
01:48:35,200 --> 01:48:35,712
Got a job

1918
01:48:35,968 --> 01:48:37,760
Bank account that works

1919
01:48:38,784 --> 01:48:40,064
Someone lost her husband

1920
01:48:40,576 --> 01:48:41,600
Daddy didn't come home for that

1921
01:48:41,856 --> 01:48:43,136
Millions

1922
01:48:43,392 --> 01:48:43,904
Died

1923
01:48:44,160 --> 01:48:46,464
So what's interesting here is it Alex's

1924
01:48:46,720 --> 01:48:47,232
Just like

1925
01:48:47,744 --> 01:48:52,096
Pejoratively referring to God as a magic

1926
01:48:55,424 --> 01:48:57,472
Like a robot

1927
01:48:57,728 --> 01:48:58,240
Kind of

1928
01:48:58,496 --> 01:48:59,776
View things and then

1929
01:49:00,032 --> 01:49:05,152
If you really look at what he saying about like you on your motorboat there with you with your nice house

1930
01:49:05,408 --> 01:49:06,688
He's turning

1931
01:49:07,200 --> 01:49:13,344
Capitalists of the past yet into Christ they died for your ability to have this

1932
01:49:13,600 --> 01:49:15,136
Smoker pellets

1933
01:49:15,392 --> 01:49:20,000
62 million

1934
01:49:20,256 --> 01:49:22,304
I need nothing

1935
01:49:22,560 --> 01:49:23,328
God is the market

1936
01:49:25,120 --> 01:49:26,656
So Darkness

1937
01:49:26,912 --> 01:49:27,936
Think about it

1938
01:49:30,752 --> 01:49:34,336
Easy about Christ that is a Christian

1939
01:49:34,592 --> 01:49:37,408
Sacrifice sacrifice

1940
01:49:37,920 --> 01:49:39,200
For your sins

1941
01:49:39,456 --> 01:49:43,808
Course Alex's framing these people in the past who have fought two up

1942
01:49:44,064 --> 01:49:45,344
Hold this system

1943
01:49:45,600 --> 01:49:46,368
Capitalism

1944
01:49:47,904 --> 01:49:50,976
Christ figure think about all those men

1945
01:49:51,232 --> 01:49:52,000
Who got black

1946
01:49:52,256 --> 01:49:56,864
In order to save your bank account

1947
01:49:57,120 --> 01:49:59,424
They were in the

1948
01:49:59,680 --> 01:50:05,824
Dial

1949
01:50:08,640 --> 01:50:14,784
I just can't do it another day and then they think about Jeff bezo someday in the future making a billion dollars in a

1950
01:50:15,296 --> 01:50:15,808
And they're like

1951
01:50:16,064 --> 01:50:16,832
Goddess sacrifice

1952
01:50:17,856 --> 01:50:23,488
He died for his billions

1953
01:50:23,744 --> 01:50:24,768
Zach reversa

1954
01:50:25,024 --> 01:50:29,376
Jesus where it is one person

1955
01:50:29,632 --> 01:50:31,680
The entirety of the world as opposed to

1956
01:50:31,936 --> 01:50:36,288
Millions of people who sacrificed

1957
01:50:36,800 --> 01:50:41,152
Yeah you know it.

1958
01:50:41,408 --> 01:50:45,248
World's total inversion of the the Jesus sacrifice

1959
01:50:45,504 --> 01:50:48,064
Good

1960
01:50:48,576 --> 01:50:49,088
Pretty sure

1961
01:50:49,600 --> 01:50:51,648
Don't lose the lord's name in vain

1962
01:50:51,904 --> 01:50:55,232
Does not include calling him a magic dude in the sky

1963
01:50:55,488 --> 01:51:01,632
Seems it seems a little derisive

1964
01:51:09,312 --> 01:51:14,688
Tucker Carlson a year-and-a-half ago that people come to his house breakdown add or threatened to rape and kill his wife

1965
01:51:15,712 --> 01:51:17,248
I never told people laughing.

1966
01:51:19,296 --> 01:51:20,832
Things that are going on here

1967
01:51:22,368 --> 01:51:24,928
Until I learned what was happening other areas

1968
01:51:25,184 --> 01:51:25,696
Country

1969
01:51:25,952 --> 01:51:26,464
What's up

1970
01:51:28,256 --> 01:51:29,536
But now I'm going to lay it out

1971
01:51:34,144 --> 01:51:35,168
Abbott from New York City

1972
01:51:35,680 --> 01:51:36,704
New York okay

1973
01:51:36,960 --> 01:51:38,496
Los Angeles California

1974
01:51:40,032 --> 01:51:40,800
Federal Marshal

1975
01:51:41,056 --> 01:51:41,824
The FBI

1976
01:51:42,080 --> 01:51:43,360
And finally today

1977
01:51:45,408 --> 01:51:45,920
PD

1978
01:51:47,200 --> 01:51:47,968
Confirm

1979
01:51:48,480 --> 01:51:49,504
What I was told

1980
01:51:50,016 --> 01:51:51,040
But because I wasn't

1981
01:51:52,832 --> 01:51:53,600
Absolutely

1982
01:51:53,856 --> 01:51:54,624
I did not tell you

1983
01:52:01,024 --> 01:52:01,536
Have

1984
01:52:02,560 --> 01:52:04,096
Ridiculously name

1985
01:52:06,144 --> 01:52:06,912
Assault

1986
01:52:11,264 --> 01:52:14,080
Driving around in SUVs and trucks antifa

1987
01:52:15,616 --> 01:52:17,408
With two and four men

1988
01:52:17,920 --> 01:52:18,688
Groups

1989
01:52:19,712 --> 01:52:20,736
Pairing

1990
01:52:21,248 --> 01:52:23,296
Anyone that doesn't stop at a checkpoint

1991
01:52:24,064 --> 01:52:25,600
Including police

1992
01:52:25,856 --> 01:52:26,880
Will be killed

1993
01:52:28,160 --> 01:52:29,440
And that's just the surface

1994
01:52:29,952 --> 01:52:31,744
You're already talked about this base

1995
01:52:34,816 --> 01:52:39,936
Suspicious

1996
01:52:42,752 --> 01:52:43,520
Print it out

1997
01:52:43,776 --> 01:52:45,312
Statement from the Austin

1998
01:52:46,848 --> 01:52:47,360
It does

1999
01:52:47,616 --> 01:52:50,176
It's pointless

2000
01:52:50,432 --> 01:52:52,736
They're going to blow up the Austin

2001
01:52:52,992 --> 01:52:53,504
We have the

2002
01:52:53,760 --> 01:52:55,552
We have officially been announced

2003
01:52:56,064 --> 01:52:59,648
In the city council of Austin that they're going to blow up the police department

2004
01:53:00,160 --> 01:53:01,440
I showed you that last hour

2005
01:53:03,488 --> 01:53:04,512
Officially in the budget

2006
01:53:05,024 --> 01:53:07,072
This isn't some recommendations

2007
01:53:09,120 --> 01:53:10,912
Doesn't make sense

2008
01:53:11,424 --> 01:53:11,936
This isn't

2009
01:53:17,056 --> 01:53:17,568
Is here

2010
01:53:18,080 --> 01:53:18,592
So

2011
01:53:19,104 --> 01:53:19,616
You know

2012
01:53:20,896 --> 01:53:23,712
This is very weak that's are the Takeover is here

2013
01:53:24,224 --> 01:53:24,992
Right

2014
01:53:25,248 --> 01:53:27,808
They're there if they've already pulled the trigger

2015
01:53:28,064 --> 01:53:28,576
Yeah

2016
01:53:30,112 --> 01:53:32,928
And when they pull the trigger

2017
01:53:33,440 --> 01:53:35,488
Well that the hill said the time is right

2018
01:53:35,744 --> 01:53:36,256
You'll know

2019
01:53:36,512 --> 01:53:42,656
I mean I do know he said no he said it's you'll know

2020
01:53:42,912 --> 01:53:49,056
Legally Legally you know when the time is right

2021
01:53:49,568 --> 01:53:51,616
Luigi Luigi

2022
01:53:51,872 --> 01:53:52,640
Anyway

2023
01:53:53,664 --> 01:53:54,944
Here's the big news

2024
01:54:00,832 --> 01:54:01,344
I believe

2025
01:54:03,136 --> 01:54:04,416
Weiner

2026
01:54:05,952 --> 01:54:07,488
You said you were trying to build it off

2027
01:54:09,280 --> 01:54:11,328
Multinational corporations have

2028
01:54:11,584 --> 01:54:15,424
Found and funded Army of mentally ill drug head

2029
01:54:16,704 --> 01:54:17,728
White people mainly

2030
01:54:19,520 --> 01:54:20,800
Call themselves antifa

2031
01:54:21,824 --> 01:54:22,848
When they are Fascist

2032
01:54:23,360 --> 01:54:24,896
Call themselves black lives matter

2033
01:54:27,968 --> 01:54:28,480
Stop it

2034
01:54:29,248 --> 01:54:31,552
You're embarrassing all these little pathetic

2035
01:54:31,808 --> 01:54:33,600
Video game playing

2036
01:54:34,880 --> 01:54:35,392
That's who they are

2037
01:54:36,160 --> 01:54:38,976
Losers lose to go out and do all this

2038
01:54:40,256 --> 01:54:43,328
And now they got them going to people's houses marking targets

2039
01:54:44,608 --> 01:54:46,400
Long way down roads

2040
01:54:52,032 --> 01:54:53,056
So the police

2041
01:54:57,664 --> 01:54:58,176
Sounds right

2042
01:54:58,688 --> 01:55:00,736
Woodson only encourages

2043
01:55:01,248 --> 01:55:02,784
The idiot method

2044
01:55:03,040 --> 01:55:05,856
The carry out the next part of the operation and their orders

2045
01:55:06,112 --> 01:55:06,624
Halftime now

2046
01:55:07,904 --> 01:55:08,928
Who was Saul

2047
01:55:09,440 --> 01:55:10,464
Talk show host

2048
01:55:11,232 --> 01:55:14,304
Patriot law enforcement

2049
01:55:14,560 --> 01:55:16,608
Members of Congress members of State legislatures

2050
01:55:16,864 --> 01:55:18,400
Governors that don't roll over

2051
01:55:20,448 --> 01:55:21,728
They are so important

2052
01:55:24,032 --> 01:55:25,056
And Obama and Hillary

2053
01:55:25,312 --> 01:55:26,848
Houses

2054
01:55:29,408 --> 01:55:30,432
Police

2055
01:55:30,944 --> 01:55:32,992
Armed with weapons with

2056
01:55:33,248 --> 01:55:33,760
Amber's in Hatchet

2057
01:55:34,272 --> 01:55:36,320
What a what a waste of

2058
01:55:36,576 --> 01:55:38,112
Like structure of a show

2059
01:55:38,368 --> 01:55:39,904
You know what I mean like

2060
01:55:40,160 --> 01:55:40,672
He's

2061
01:55:42,208 --> 01:55:48,352
At the end of the episode exactly the same as saying an hour and a half early

2062
01:55:48,608 --> 01:55:50,912
Couldn't stop himself from getting into

2063
01:55:51,168 --> 01:55:51,680
He's like

2064
01:55:52,192 --> 01:55:53,984
Talking about these details

2065
01:55:54,496 --> 01:55:56,544
And scaring people to the point where you couldn't

2066
01:55:56,800 --> 01:55:58,592
Even hold off on the big reveal

2067
01:55:59,104 --> 01:55:59,616
Until the end

2068
01:56:00,128 --> 01:56:03,456
Surrounds

2069
01:56:03,712 --> 01:56:04,480
The

2070
01:56:04,736 --> 01:56:09,856
Good the narcissistic response that he has two other people outside of his media bubble

2071
01:56:10,112 --> 01:56:12,672
Paying attention he's irrelevant

2072
01:56:16,256 --> 01:56:17,024
Man

2073
01:56:18,304 --> 01:56:20,352
Every every single mom

2074
01:56:21,120 --> 01:56:22,400
At the front line in Portland

2075
01:56:22,656 --> 01:56:23,936
Has more courage

2076
01:56:24,192 --> 01:56:24,960
In their f******

2077
01:56:25,216 --> 01:56:25,728
Fingers

2078
01:56:26,240 --> 01:56:29,824
Alex f****** the entire Republican goddamn

2079
01:56:30,592 --> 01:56:31,360
Every single one

2080
01:56:32,896 --> 01:56:34,176
Disgusting

2081
01:56:34,432 --> 01:56:35,968
For you to say anything about

2082
01:56:36,224 --> 01:56:38,016
They've got an army of meth head

2083
01:56:38,272 --> 01:56:41,088
There's moms out there on the front

2084
01:56:41,344 --> 01:56:42,368
Bucking why

2085
01:56:42,624 --> 01:56:43,136
True

2086
01:56:44,160 --> 01:56:47,488
You don't know there's not like that song

2087
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:48,768
Mom

2088
01:56:49,024 --> 01:56:53,120
Yeah that's true

2089
01:56:53,376 --> 01:56:58,240
Head argue that there is a connection there

2090
01:56:59,264 --> 01:57:02,592
I think there's something interesting in there like Alex on the 28th

2091
01:57:02,848 --> 01:57:03,872
Wasn't really all that

2092
01:57:04,128 --> 01:57:05,664
Concerned didn't even really mention

2093
01:57:06,944 --> 01:57:07,712
Frontline thing

2094
01:57:07,968 --> 01:57:12,576
Just did pay programming supposedly or what I would I be

2095
01:57:13,088 --> 01:57:14,368
Joel skousen

2096
01:57:15,392 --> 01:57:16,416
Just a bunch of nonsense

2097
01:57:16,928 --> 01:57:18,208
And then the day after

2098
01:57:18,464 --> 01:57:20,512
He's in a really f***** up headspace

2099
01:57:20,768 --> 01:57:24,096
Of of like really relishing and being euphoric about

2100
01:57:24,352 --> 01:57:24,864
This attack

2101
01:57:25,120 --> 01:57:27,424
She has suffered

2102
01:57:27,680 --> 01:57:28,704
Or whatever

2103
01:57:29,216 --> 01:57:29,984
And

2104
01:57:30,496 --> 01:57:35,360
He's built up this narrative where there's antifa MS-13 hit teams

2105
01:57:35,616 --> 01:57:36,896
That are going to kill all the

2106
01:57:37,152 --> 01:57:37,664
Fruit starting

2107
01:57:45,600 --> 01:57:48,416
I'm sure disturbing disturbing

2108
01:57:49,952 --> 01:57:51,488
And that would be where we at

2109
01:57:51,744 --> 01:57:53,792
4 Thursday morning

2110
01:57:54,048 --> 01:57:54,816
Trump tweeting

2111
01:57:55,072 --> 01:57:56,096
Responsibility

2112
01:57:56,608 --> 01:58:02,752
People are the ones who are Fascist and they're the ones who are fashion cuz it's a real fast

2113
01:58:03,008 --> 01:58:09,152
Just thing to do to not agree with the president whenever he says

2114
01:58:09,920 --> 01:58:11,712
Who claims to have great sources

2115
01:58:13,248 --> 01:58:14,528
Tomorrow's news today

2116
01:58:14,784 --> 01:58:18,112
Something about

2117
01:58:18,368 --> 01:58:21,952
The fact that drop tomorrow B between about the possibility

2118
01:58:22,208 --> 01:58:22,720
I mean who knows

2119
01:58:24,256 --> 01:58:25,792
Didn't didn't I get into that

2120
01:58:27,584 --> 01:58:31,168
Even bigger news has broken was here on the 30th

2121
01:58:31,424 --> 01:58:33,216
The news I'm about to announce

2122
01:58:35,008 --> 01:58:36,544
The biggest

2123
01:58:38,848 --> 01:58:41,152
And is Crescendo of incredible development

2124
01:58:46,016 --> 01:58:46,528
This morning

2125
01:58:47,552 --> 01:58:48,576
All the pieces put together

2126
01:58:51,904 --> 01:58:52,672
I will tell you this

2127
01:58:53,184 --> 01:58:53,696
Trumpets

2128
01:58:54,208 --> 01:58:56,256
Carry firearms at all time

2129
01:58:57,792 --> 01:58:58,816
The shotguns

2130
01:59:02,912 --> 01:59:03,936
Haven't even hand.

2131
01:59:04,960 --> 01:59:06,240
Because

2132
01:59:06,496 --> 01:59:08,032
Threat Level in this country

2133
01:59:08,800 --> 01:59:10,336
To what is known as the leadership

2134
01:59:10,848 --> 01:59:12,384
American resistance

2135
01:59:12,896 --> 01:59:13,664
Steakhouse

2136
01:59:14,944 --> 01:59:15,968
Is extremely serious

2137
01:59:16,224 --> 01:59:20,576
Big news at Alex's teasing and as a result of his news

2138
01:59:20,832 --> 01:59:22,880
He's going to be carrying a gun with

2139
01:59:23,392 --> 01:59:23,904
I think everybody did

2140
01:59:24,160 --> 01:59:27,232
Just assume you probably already were already

2141
01:59:27,744 --> 01:59:33,888
He might as well be a walking gun take any weapon

2142
01:59:34,144 --> 01:59:37,216
His entire personality

2143
01:59:37,728 --> 01:59:42,336
Yeah so this is about delaying the election

2144
01:59:42,592 --> 01:59:43,872
Intuit

2145
01:59:44,640 --> 01:59:46,688
Where's the giant piece of the puzzle that just went into completed

2146
01:59:52,064 --> 01:59:55,392
Universal mail-in voting

2147
01:59:57,952 --> 02:00:00,000
2020 will be the most

2148
02:00:05,120 --> 02:00:06,144
Embarrassment to the USA

2149
02:00:06,656 --> 02:00:08,960
The lady election until people can properly

2150
02:00:09,984 --> 02:00:10,752
Safeway

2151
02:00:12,544 --> 02:00:14,848
I totally agree with the president this year

2152
02:00:21,504 --> 02:00:22,272
Oh will beg

2153
02:00:23,040 --> 02:00:23,808
My father suddenly

2154
02:00:24,064 --> 02:00:25,856
Believe

2155
02:00:26,112 --> 02:00:27,904
He's not going to accept the results of the election

2156
02:00:28,928 --> 02:00:30,976
Because he's being advised by smart people

2157
02:00:31,232 --> 02:00:32,256
But you cannot allow

2158
02:00:33,536 --> 02:00:38,912
In over 25 State and over 800 weapons control settings

2159
02:00:44,032 --> 02:00:47,872
This is exactly the same ship

2160
02:00:48,128 --> 02:00:49,152
Like you was saying

2161
02:00:49,408 --> 02:00:55,296
Obama would try and is using

2162
02:00:55,808 --> 02:00:58,624
Some sort of a crisis they would cause

2163
02:00:58,880 --> 02:01:02,720
Some sort of a natural disaster with their weather control manipulation

2164
02:01:02,976 --> 02:01:04,512
Frozen fever

2165
02:01:04,768 --> 02:01:09,632
You know they be like hey we can't possibly have an election because there's been this natural disaster that

2166
02:01:09,888 --> 02:01:14,240
Excuse as to why they couldn't be an election

2167
02:01:20,896 --> 02:01:25,760
Right as opposed to what he's been saying for years and years and years and years

2168
02:01:26,016 --> 02:01:28,320
I saw all that stuff

2169
02:01:28,576 --> 02:01:29,344
This morning where it's like

2170
02:01:29,600 --> 02:01:33,184
Trump was just waiting. Out to distract from how the economy is the worst thing

2171
02:01:34,720 --> 02:01:37,024
And I'm just sitting here just being like

2172
02:01:37,536 --> 02:01:38,048
You idiots

2173
02:01:38,304 --> 02:01:39,328
You f****** moron

2174
02:01:39,584 --> 02:01:41,376
You better start having a plan

2175
02:01:41,632 --> 02:01:42,656
For when he does this

2176
02:01:43,424 --> 02:01:45,216
You should not have a plan for

2177
02:01:45,472 --> 02:01:47,776
I'm sure that the Supreme Court will stop at

2178
02:01:48,032 --> 02:01:51,104
The Supreme Court election in my lifetime

2179
02:01:53,664 --> 02:01:55,200
Play for it

2180
02:01:55,456 --> 02:01:56,992
Plan for it

2181
02:01:57,248 --> 02:02:02,112
I'm not as interested also in the

2182
02:02:02,368 --> 02:02:03,904
Distraction from ex wires

2183
02:02:04,160 --> 02:02:05,440
I'm also not

2184
02:02:05,696 --> 02:02:06,464
The camp of

2185
02:02:06,976 --> 02:02:07,488
He can

2186
02:02:07,744 --> 02:02:10,048
Unilaterally do this absolutely

2187
02:02:10,816 --> 02:02:11,584
But I

2188
02:02:11,840 --> 02:02:13,632
I agree with you that like

2189
02:02:14,656 --> 02:02:15,424
This is a line

2190
02:02:15,936 --> 02:02:16,960
That like you just can't

2191
02:02:17,216 --> 02:02:18,496
Can't you can't you can't

2192
02:02:18,752 --> 02:02:20,800
No there is there

2193
02:02:21,312 --> 02:02:24,896
Congress or whomever I don't know not taking

2194
02:02:25,152 --> 02:02:27,200
Suggestions like this seriously

2195
02:02:29,248 --> 02:02:30,784
Insect adherence

2196
02:02:31,040 --> 02:02:31,552
You're insane

2197
02:02:32,064 --> 02:02:33,856
He is going to try and steal this election

2198
02:02:34,112 --> 02:02:40,256
That is not a conversation

2199
02:02:40,512 --> 02:02:45,120
Do that because otherwise he's a terrorist

2200
02:02:48,704 --> 02:02:51,776
We're going to move back the election

2201
02:02:52,544 --> 02:02:55,616
You don't stop the mail-in ballots have to be declared fraudulent

2202
02:02:58,944 --> 02:02:59,968
Fraudulent made up

2203
02:03:00,224 --> 02:03:02,528
Mail-in ballots that are fake

2204
02:03:04,320 --> 02:03:10,208
Time results and throw Outlook is it good and they're staying even challenge

2205
02:03:10,720 --> 02:03:13,792
Frogs coming out everywhere

2206
02:03:14,304 --> 02:03:16,864
Stacked up in people's mailboxes

2207
02:03:19,168 --> 02:03:19,680
Florida

2208
02:03:20,192 --> 02:03:20,704
Texas

2209
02:03:22,752 --> 02:03:23,264
Michigan

2210
02:03:31,968 --> 02:03:33,248
They're going to say he's a terrorist

2211
02:03:34,016 --> 02:03:34,784
Anastasia bad guy

2212
02:03:35,040 --> 02:03:38,880
Does anybody realize the maximum alert they're making their move

2213
02:03:39,392 --> 02:03:40,672
You can see here how

2214
02:03:40,928 --> 02:03:42,976
Smooth transitions

2215
02:03:43,232 --> 02:03:43,744
Advocating for a

2216
02:03:44,000 --> 02:03:46,304
Completely Auntie democratic system of government

2217
02:03:47,072 --> 02:03:48,864
Because he has his fever fraudulent vote

2218
02:03:49,120 --> 02:03:54,240
Space mostly on memes and misrepresentations of headlines

2219
02:03:54,496 --> 02:04:00,640
He's positing that the only thing done to protect the country's to not have an election until all this is sorted out

2220
02:04:01,408 --> 02:04:04,224
What this accomplishes is basically allowing Alex and his

2221
02:04:04,480 --> 02:04:06,016
Define the terms of a quotient

2222
02:04:06,272 --> 02:04:06,784
Pharaohplex

2223
02:04:07,296 --> 02:04:09,344
Which is the standard that they will never reach

2224
02:04:09,600 --> 02:04:13,184
Democratic party should be outlawed

2225
02:04:13,440 --> 02:04:17,536
Do you think he'll ever say all right now it's safe to have

2226
02:04:17,792 --> 02:04:18,560
Never happen

2227
02:04:19,328 --> 02:04:20,608
Imagine this does go down

2228
02:04:20,864 --> 02:04:23,168
Trump somehow gets Congress to delay the election

2229
02:04:23,680 --> 02:04:24,192
Then what

2230
02:04:24,704 --> 02:04:26,240
When does the election get rescheduled

2231
02:04:27,008 --> 02:04:33,152
If the complaint is that the mail-in voting system is fraudulent wouldn't be until the covid-19 situation is worse

2232
02:04:33,408 --> 02:04:34,688
Which could be a while

2233
02:04:34,944 --> 02:04:36,480
So Trump going to be president

2234
02:04:36,736 --> 02:04:37,760
Until covid is over

2235
02:04:38,016 --> 02:04:39,808
Or does he still end his term

2236
02:04:40,064 --> 02:04:40,832
What do you do

2237
02:04:41,088 --> 02:04:43,904
Maybe since the problem is the mail-in voting system

2238
02:04:44,672 --> 02:04:45,952
Trump re-election

2239
02:04:46,208 --> 02:04:48,512
The only after a thorough investigation of May

2240
02:04:48,768 --> 02:04:49,536
Voting was done

2241
02:04:52,352 --> 02:04:52,864
Just that.

2242
02:04:59,008 --> 02:05:00,800
Systems in the country before

2243
02:05:01,056 --> 02:05:01,824
Agrees to an election

2244
02:05:02,080 --> 02:05:03,104
Isn't how this work

2245
02:05:03,360 --> 02:05:05,920
The president has to agree to an election

2246
02:05:06,176 --> 02:05:08,992
Everybody knows the democracies only work whenever the

2247
02:05:09,504 --> 02:05:11,296
Agrees to the elect

2248
02:05:11,808 --> 02:05:15,136
This is probably the scariest thing I've heard from Alex Jones

2249
02:05:15,392 --> 02:05:21,536
Yeah it's not even worth while to discuss how he constantly screamed his audience about spheres of Obama

2250
02:05:21,792 --> 02:05:24,352
Election of 2012

2251
02:05:24,608 --> 02:05:26,400
16 just the Highlight is apocracy

2252
02:05:26,912 --> 02:05:29,472
That does not even really matter right now because Alex

2253
02:05:29,728 --> 02:05:32,032
So transparently dangerous

2254
02:05:32,288 --> 02:05:36,128
But even engaging with it as something as something normal is wrong

2255
02:05:36,896 --> 02:05:42,784
It was generally very entertaining Alex's stupid ideas and trying to understand where they come from

2256
02:05:43,040 --> 02:05:45,600
A better understanding

2257
02:05:45,856 --> 02:05:46,624
Misinformation

2258
02:05:46,880 --> 02:05:47,648
Ecosystem

2259
02:05:47,904 --> 02:05:48,416
Sparta

2260
02:05:48,928 --> 02:05:49,440
In this case

2261
02:05:49,696 --> 02:05:50,208
F*** that

2262
02:05:50,464 --> 02:05:54,048
I was just cheerleading a direct assault on the idea of a democratically elect

2263
02:05:54,304 --> 02:05:55,328
The government in this country

2264
02:05:55,584 --> 02:05:57,632
And that's crossing a line that I cannot tolerate

2265
02:05:58,400 --> 02:06:01,472
Trump suggesting postponing the election is a Redline

2266
02:06:01,984 --> 02:06:06,080
Where people need to start taking this very seriously and considering what this could mean for the future

2267
02:06:06,848 --> 02:06:09,664
Alex endorsing it to tell you something

2268
02:06:10,944 --> 02:06:13,760
Sterno and that's what his political project

2269
02:06:14,016 --> 02:06:15,296
It's never been about the concert

2270
02:06:15,552 --> 02:06:16,576
Tatoosh in our love for America

2271
02:06:17,088 --> 02:06:21,184
Is always Christian nationalist

2272
02:06:21,440 --> 02:06:21,952
Dictatorship

2273
02:06:22,208 --> 02:06:25,280
And that's what he sees as being possible now

2274
02:06:25,792 --> 02:06:28,608
And he's going to fight like hell in order to

2275
02:06:28,864 --> 02:06:30,144
I try and install that

2276
02:06:30,656 --> 02:06:31,424
As well they are

2277
02:06:31,936 --> 02:06:33,728
Probably more than

2278
02:06:33,984 --> 02:06:34,752
More people

2279
02:06:35,008 --> 02:06:36,032
Would be comfortable imagine

2280
02:06:37,824 --> 02:06:38,848
So I don't know I mean

2281
02:06:39,104 --> 02:06:39,872
Obviously

2282
02:06:40,384 --> 02:06:41,152
I don't know what's going to

2283
02:06:41,408 --> 02:06:42,688
To become of this but like this is

2284
02:06:42,944 --> 02:06:43,456
This is this

2285
02:06:45,760 --> 02:06:46,784
Everything is bad

2286
02:06:47,040 --> 02:06:50,112
Protesters as un troops

2287
02:06:50,368 --> 02:06:51,648
Some stuff like that is bad

2288
02:06:52,416 --> 02:06:52,928
Trump

2289
02:06:54,720 --> 02:06:56,000
Muslims shouldn't come to the country

2290
02:06:56,512 --> 02:06:57,536
That's really bad

2291
02:06:57,792 --> 02:06:59,328
Stuff is really bad

2292
02:07:00,864 --> 02:07:01,376
This

2293
02:07:02,656 --> 02:07:03,424
Beauty sleep

2294
02:07:04,192 --> 02:07:04,960
Because

2295
02:07:08,544 --> 02:07:09,824
It's so Central

2296
02:07:10,080 --> 02:07:11,872
To the idea that this could never

2297
02:07:12,384 --> 02:07:13,664
Yeah you know like

2298
02:07:14,944 --> 02:07:15,456
With

2299
02:07:16,736 --> 02:07:20,320
Something like Muslims can come into this executive order

2300
02:07:23,392 --> 02:07:26,976
Is disqualifying in what we should see as a l 100

2301
02:07:28,768 --> 02:07:29,536
Assuming

2302
02:07:30,304 --> 02:07:33,888
The next Administration comes in

2303
02:07:36,448 --> 02:07:39,264
Try and mitigate

2304
02:07:41,056 --> 02:07:44,128
Hunan governmental organizations that can fight in court

2305
02:07:44,384 --> 02:07:45,152
Do duplex

2306
02:07:45,408 --> 02:07:46,688
Stop deportation total

2307
02:07:46,944 --> 02:07:49,504
You can have Charities that help displaced people

2308
02:07:50,784 --> 02:07:51,296
Focus on

2309
02:07:51,552 --> 02:07:52,832
In the Keys

2310
02:07:54,112 --> 02:07:55,136
A president of a

2311
02:07:55,392 --> 02:07:56,160
Nuclear-armed

2312
02:07:56,416 --> 02:07:56,928
Country

2313
02:07:57,184 --> 02:07:57,952
That is

2314
02:07:58,208 --> 02:07:58,976
Central

2315
02:08:00,256 --> 02:08:01,792
Functioning of the world

2316
02:08:02,048 --> 02:08:02,560
Exactly

2317
02:08:02,816 --> 02:08:05,120
The idea of becoming

2318
02:08:07,168 --> 02:08:09,728
Authoritarian position dictatorship

2319
02:08:10,752 --> 02:08:12,032
There is

2320
02:08:13,056 --> 02:08:14,080
Such a line

2321
02:08:14,336 --> 02:08:15,104
There

2322
02:08:15,360 --> 02:08:15,872
Is

2323
02:08:16,128 --> 02:08:19,968
I mean honestly I see that that very tweet

2324
02:08:20,224 --> 02:08:22,272
Is

2325
02:08:22,528 --> 02:08:24,064
Should probably

2326
02:08:24,320 --> 02:08:25,600
Include the 25th Amendment

2327
02:08:25,856 --> 02:08:29,184
Like legitimately

2328
02:08:29,952 --> 02:08:32,000
It is time to get rid of that president

2329
02:08:32,256 --> 02:08:37,632
Right

2330
02:08:37,888 --> 02:08:39,424
Don't give a s***

2331
02:08:47,360 --> 02:08:49,408
If Obama even joked about that

2332
02:08:49,664 --> 02:08:52,736
We would not hear the end of it from anyone

2333
02:08:52,992 --> 02:08:57,600
Forever about Obama joking about being Superman

2334
02:09:02,720 --> 02:09:06,048
Comedies

2335
02:09:06,304 --> 02:09:08,864
About

2336
02:09:09,120 --> 02:09:11,424
Announces f****** documentary

2337
02:09:11,936 --> 02:09:12,448
You got it

2338
02:09:14,240 --> 02:09:16,544
To me this should be like a real

2339
02:09:16,800 --> 02:09:17,824
Crystallizing moment

2340
02:09:18,848 --> 02:09:19,360
Like

2341
02:09:19,872 --> 02:09:21,408
When people say

2342
02:09:22,176 --> 02:09:26,016
If these sorts of things are the Tendencies the Trump has

2343
02:09:26,528 --> 02:09:28,576
They weren't saying that for no reason

2344
02:09:28,832 --> 02:09:31,392
These are the Tendencies the Trump has

2345
02:09:31,904 --> 02:09:33,184
And allowed

2346
02:09:33,696 --> 02:09:34,464
Uncheck

2347
02:09:34,720 --> 02:09:35,744
To continue

2348
02:09:36,256 --> 02:09:37,280
Will lead

2349
02:09:37,536 --> 02:09:38,560
NeverEnding

2350
02:09:38,816 --> 02:09:40,608
Trump dictatorship

2351
02:09:41,632 --> 02:09:42,656
It's

2352
02:09:46,240 --> 02:09:47,264
Your timing is just

2353
02:09:47,520 --> 02:09:49,056
That is the

2354
02:09:49,824 --> 02:09:51,104
That's legitimately the line

2355
02:09:51,616 --> 02:09:56,480
When can you hit bottom

2356
02:09:56,992 --> 02:09:57,760
This is the bottom

2357
02:09:58,016 --> 02:10:01,344
Alex saying that it's okay to have a trump LED dictatorship

2358
02:10:01,600 --> 02:10:03,136
Is him reaching the bottom

2359
02:10:03,648 --> 02:10:08,256
Because I don't give a s*** what happens if yes

2360
02:10:08,512 --> 02:10:10,816
Like in instances where it's like

2361
02:10:11,840 --> 02:10:12,608
Abstract

2362
02:10:12,864 --> 02:10:17,216
Trump doesn't appear to be involved in Alex's fantasy

2363
02:10:18,240 --> 02:10:22,336
Trump making jokes about 60 more years

2364
02:10:22,592 --> 02:10:24,640
Mad

2365
02:10:24,896 --> 02:10:25,664
Nonsense

2366
02:10:25,920 --> 02:10:26,432
It's b*******

2367
02:10:26,688 --> 02:10:27,968
Need something

2368
02:10:28,224 --> 02:10:31,296
People should rightly point out be like a look at this

2369
02:10:33,344 --> 02:10:33,856
Trump

2370
02:10:34,368 --> 02:10:40,512
Making excuses about mail-in votes being also fraudulent in the election

2371
02:10:40,768 --> 02:10:43,072
Or possibly we should put off the election

2372
02:10:43,584 --> 02:10:45,120
Absolutely

2373
02:10:46,144 --> 02:10:47,424
It's unacceptable

2374
02:10:48,448 --> 02:10:51,264
You can you can buy the joke whenever he says 16 years

2375
02:10:51,520 --> 02:10:52,800
Because sounds

2376
02:10:54,080 --> 02:10:54,592
2insane

2377
02:10:54,848 --> 02:10:57,408
Extra 6 months

2378
02:10:57,664 --> 02:11:00,224
Text to 6 months

2379
02:11:02,016 --> 02:11:03,040
More to the point

2380
02:11:04,064 --> 02:11:04,576
Because

2381
02:11:04,832 --> 02:11:05,856
It is only an extra

2382
02:11:06,880 --> 02:11:08,416
That's when you know ocean

2383
02:11:08,928 --> 02:11:09,440
This is

2384
02:11:09,696 --> 02:11:10,720
This is never going to end

2385
02:11:11,232 --> 02:11:14,816
And this is basically Star Wars prequels

2386
02:11:15,072 --> 02:11:16,096
Essentially

2387
02:11:16,352 --> 02:11:17,632
Really is

2388
02:11:20,960 --> 02:11:27,104
There's no way you guys don't see the Republican Senate going along

2389
02:11:27,360 --> 02:11:29,152
The goddamn Merrick Garland

2390
02:11:29,408 --> 02:11:35,552
Argument of no we should wait until Bubba Bubba Bubba until the results of the election or f******

2391
02:11:35,808 --> 02:11:41,184
And then we needed the Supreme Court validated and says it because we can't be guaranteed on those

2392
02:11:44,256 --> 02:11:50,400
You're speculating a lot about how these steps would go but I understand why

2393
02:11:50,656 --> 02:11:51,424
Understand why

2394
02:11:51,680 --> 02:11:52,448
The president

2395
02:11:52,704 --> 02:11:55,520
That we've seen over the last number of years

2396
02:11:55,776 --> 02:11:56,800
Even the last 20 years

2397
02:11:58,848 --> 02:11:59,360
Inspiring

2398
02:11:59,872 --> 02:12:01,152
It hasn't been encouraging

2399
02:12:01,408 --> 02:12:03,712
To see the Supreme Court has ruled

2400
02:12:03,968 --> 02:12:09,344
Particularly this Senate has lost the election

2401
02:12:10,112 --> 02:12:11,904
It's not

2402
02:12:12,160 --> 02:12:13,184
No

2403
02:12:15,232 --> 02:12:16,000
Anything

2404
02:12:16,256 --> 02:12:19,840
Will be accepted by the Supreme Court

2405
02:12:20,096 --> 02:12:24,192
It does give you cause for Paws as you might say

2406
02:12:24,448 --> 02:12:25,472
If you wanted to rhyme

2407
02:12:25,984 --> 02:12:30,080
I don't know I don't want to deep down this road because I think that there is a certain amount of

2408
02:12:30,336 --> 02:12:31,872
They could be over reaction

2409
02:12:33,152 --> 02:12:36,224
But if there's anything that you should over react to

2410
02:12:36,480 --> 02:12:38,272
Yeah it's something like that

2411
02:12:40,576 --> 02:12:41,856
No there should be in over react

2412
02:12:42,112 --> 02:12:45,184
Yeah that is an overreaction is the correct

2413
02:12:48,512 --> 02:12:50,816
Many people will be hurt by

2414
02:12:53,120 --> 02:12:56,704
It's unconscionable to think about just because

2415
02:12:56,960 --> 02:12:58,496
The covid thing is not going to

2416
02:12:58,752 --> 02:12:59,264
Go away

2417
02:13:00,288 --> 02:13:03,872
And if he stays in there for any capacity it is going to get

2418
02:13:05,408 --> 02:13:05,920
Right

2419
02:13:06,432 --> 02:13:08,992
I mean that's only even one

2420
02:13:11,296 --> 02:13:14,880
But really the issue is MS-13 in Chinese

2421
02:13:15,136 --> 02:13:16,928
Speedmaster Excel

2422
02:13:17,696 --> 02:13:19,744
MS-13 Tricom team

2423
02:13:20,256 --> 02:13:21,280
Other groups ready to

2424
02:13:21,536 --> 02:13:22,560
Cooperation

2425
02:13:25,120 --> 02:13:25,632
Patriot

2426
02:13:26,144 --> 02:13:28,448
During all of this and then call a race war

2427
02:13:32,800 --> 02:13:38,432
Are going to have to themselves in the rightful Authority would George Washington do you know it's worth why she would do

2428
02:13:39,968 --> 02:13:42,272
If you're drowning in debt you can't afford

2429
02:13:42,784 --> 02:13:44,064
Alex wants

2430
02:13:44,320 --> 02:13:46,112
Toledo revolutionary war against

2431
02:13:46,624 --> 02:13:47,392
I guess things

2432
02:13:47,904 --> 02:13:51,232
Inside the country that are his enemies

2433
02:13:51,744 --> 02:13:52,256
Famous

2434
02:13:52,512 --> 02:13:57,888
For arguing that there should be asked to stay on in the executive branch

2435
02:13:58,144 --> 02:14:01,216
Passed his second term said no earlier

2436
02:14:01,472 --> 02:14:01,984
Washington

2437
02:14:03,520 --> 02:14:09,408
Killing people no but against the people he was killing where the Kings

2438
02:14:09,664 --> 02:14:10,688
Sorry the Democrats

2439
02:14:16,320 --> 02:14:19,904
So how it starts talking about what's going to need to happen if things get bad

2440
02:14:24,512 --> 02:14:25,536
It is essential

2441
02:14:26,560 --> 02:14:29,120
Killing us

2442
02:14:29,632 --> 02:14:31,424
It's essential that you do out of their leadership

2443
02:14:33,216 --> 02:14:38,848
Ladies and gentlemen that means a lot of other businessmen lot of uniform a military research people you might be 7 years old

2444
02:14:39,104 --> 02:14:41,408
You're going to have to get on that airplane

2445
02:14:42,176 --> 02:14:44,736
And you're going to have to go find these people on your mission

2446
02:14:47,552 --> 02:14:48,320
Shut up and stop

2447
02:14:51,648 --> 02:14:55,232
That we gone so far down this rathole now we're facing a communist uprising

2448
02:14:58,816 --> 02:15:00,864
Going in the Doomsday switches here ladies and gentlemen

2449
02:15:01,376 --> 02:15:02,656
What to do

2450
02:15:03,168 --> 02:15:08,288
Alex and saying like seventy-year-old ex-soldiers need to go on suicide missions

2451
02:15:08,544 --> 02:15:11,104
To take out his imagine l

2452
02:15:14,176 --> 02:15:16,992
He's essentially calling for suicide bombers

2453
02:15:17,504 --> 02:15:19,296
To go and commit missions

2454
02:15:19,552 --> 02:15:20,832
For him stop being

2455
02:15:21,088 --> 02:15:21,600
Howard's

2456
02:15:21,856 --> 02:15:24,160
What needs to be done

2457
02:15:24,672 --> 02:15:30,816
Talk about the Republican response to 9/11 as being when you look into the abyss the abyss look

2458
02:15:31,072 --> 02:15:31,840
Looks back at you

2459
02:15:32,352 --> 02:15:38,496
Like all we fought at all we hate terrorism fighting against it now

2460
02:15:38,752 --> 02:15:41,312
Best way to solve your problems with suicide

2461
02:15:41,824 --> 02:15:42,336
Everybody knows

2462
02:15:42,848 --> 02:15:48,992
That would be silly to think otherwise damn seventy-year-old ex-soldiers businessmen Garrix

2463
02:15:50,528 --> 02:15:52,576
Kill yourself by killing Soros

2464
02:15:52,832 --> 02:15:58,976
Yeah that's what is wrong with this guy

2465
02:15:59,232 --> 02:16:03,328
Execute Order 66

2466
02:16:04,352 --> 02:16:07,168
Weird feeling that I got when I would listen

2467
02:16:07,424 --> 02:16:09,216
I might be reading more into it then

2468
02:16:09,728 --> 02:16:11,008
That is necessarily there

2469
02:16:11,264 --> 02:16:14,080
There was a feeling that I got the where Alex is saying goodbye

2470
02:16:14,336 --> 02:16:15,104
In this

2471
02:16:15,360 --> 02:16:15,872
In this club

2472
02:16:16,128 --> 02:16:18,688
We can beat these people heart Bear Hands

2473
02:16:18,944 --> 02:16:20,224
When they go to restaurants

2474
02:16:20,736 --> 02:16:21,760
What

2475
02:16:22,016 --> 02:16:24,832
They're the ones

2476
02:16:25,600 --> 02:16:27,648
Long after I've gone to shovel in my grave

2477
02:16:28,416 --> 02:16:30,208
Understand that lady's and gentleman's it

2478
02:16:30,720 --> 02:16:31,744
On the real side starts

2479
02:16:33,024 --> 02:16:34,816
Now

2480
02:16:35,328 --> 02:16:36,352
Get up here until you

2481
02:16:36,864 --> 02:16:38,912
I think you already all know it anyways don't you

2482
02:16:39,424 --> 02:16:39,936
Where We Are

2483
02:16:46,848 --> 02:16:47,616
Altogether

2484
02:16:47,872 --> 02:16:51,200
Supreme

2485
02:16:51,456 --> 02:16:52,224
Call devil worshippers

2486
02:16:57,088 --> 02:16:59,136
Just like the Bible says

2487
02:17:09,888 --> 02:17:10,400
What is every culture

2488
02:17:10,912 --> 02:17:15,264
This also seems to imply that he has some believe sound like British is realism

2489
02:17:15,776 --> 02:17:16,544
Which is

2490
02:17:17,312 --> 02:17:17,824
Upsetting

2491
02:17:21,920 --> 02:17:25,760
Anything but it is

2492
02:17:26,016 --> 02:17:30,880
I think it's just for dramatic effect

2493
02:17:31,392 --> 02:17:36,256
The abyss is the end of the Republic so I love all of you you know I agree with you

2494
02:17:36,512 --> 02:17:40,608
Probably for dramatic effect effect that he wants to

2495
02:17:40,864 --> 02:17:42,656
Create is

2496
02:17:43,168 --> 02:17:48,800
We're on our kamikaze

2497
02:17:49,312 --> 02:17:49,824
Bucked up

2498
02:17:50,592 --> 02:17:52,128
But anyway there's no violence

2499
02:17:52,896 --> 02:17:53,920
What's my soulmate

2500
02:17:54,432 --> 02:18:00,576
I want to be completely clear about this no offensive violence

2501
02:18:00,832 --> 02:18:03,392
But once they start a physical

2502
02:18:08,768 --> 02:18:09,792
Operation is not

2503
02:18:11,584 --> 02:18:12,352
Jimmy the defensive

2504
02:18:13,888 --> 02:18:15,680
The best defense is offense

2505
02:18:15,936 --> 02:18:16,960
Once you enter a war

2506
02:18:17,216 --> 02:18:22,592
So once you add a reward any of this offense

2507
02:18:23,104 --> 02:18:25,408
Actually

2508
02:18:25,664 --> 02:18:26,176
In a war

2509
02:18:26,688 --> 02:18:27,968
Half an hour later

2510
02:18:34,624 --> 02:18:35,392
Nothing

2511
02:18:36,416 --> 02:18:36,928
I just want to

2512
02:18:37,440 --> 02:18:39,232
In the war

2513
02:18:43,840 --> 02:18:45,888
We are now in the war PlayStation

2514
02:18:46,144 --> 02:18:48,960
Has repeatedly is giving people looking

2515
02:18:49,216 --> 02:18:53,824
Condition where upon any kind of Silence Is by

2516
02:18:54,848 --> 02:18:58,688
Great Alex you need to pay better attention to the things you're saying

2517
02:18:58,944 --> 02:19:00,224
You're giving your audience

2518
02:19:00,480 --> 02:19:02,528
Permission to murder whoever

2519
02:19:03,296 --> 02:19:06,112
It just seems like just because you separated in

2520
02:19:06,368 --> 02:19:09,440
Time doesn't mean that you didn't still tell everybody to

2521
02:19:09,696 --> 02:19:10,208
Kill EPP

2522
02:19:10,464 --> 02:19:12,768
I don't I do not

2523
02:19:13,280 --> 02:19:14,816
At least from my perspective

2524
02:19:15,072 --> 02:19:17,888
The fact that it was a little bit later in the show

2525
02:19:18,144 --> 02:19:23,264
Can't be like all the closets

2526
02:19:23,520 --> 02:19:29,664
Basically a little bit earlier in the show he said if X-Men 1 and 1/2 hour later he said X repeatedly

2527
02:19:30,688 --> 02:19:31,712
That's

2528
02:19:33,760 --> 02:19:36,064
Logically tracks that conclusion is

2529
02:19:36,320 --> 02:19:39,392
Why but apparently logic is not allowed in the court

2530
02:19:40,416 --> 02:19:42,976
Logic isn't involved in Infowars world

2531
02:19:43,232 --> 02:19:44,256
Particularly

2532
02:19:44,512 --> 02:19:45,536
Considering

2533
02:19:45,792 --> 02:19:46,816
The guest

2534
02:19:47,840 --> 02:19:51,168
Stone is going to look at the election and Trump's response

2535
02:19:52,192 --> 02:19:53,216
Maryland fraud

2536
02:19:55,008 --> 02:19:57,312
He's going to be looking at the election with a Sim in

2537
02:19:57,824 --> 02:19:58,592
The cussing weather

2538
02:20:00,896 --> 02:20:02,944
Postpone the election until the fraud

2539
02:20:04,736 --> 02:20:06,272
Walk into the machine gun fire

2540
02:20:06,528 --> 02:20:08,064
Confrontation with them

2541
02:20:10,880 --> 02:20:13,696
Love you join the Trump tweeted after the accident need where they're going

2542
02:20:14,464 --> 02:20:19,072
So Rodger is going to come in to try and talk about

2543
02:20:19,584 --> 02:20:21,120
He's not in prison

2544
02:20:21,632 --> 02:20:22,400
You know the things

2545
02:20:22,656 --> 02:20:24,704
Sucks the most about fascist proper

2546
02:20:24,960 --> 02:20:25,728
Kiganda is that it

2547
02:20:26,240 --> 02:20:27,520
Exactly

2548
02:20:28,032 --> 02:20:30,080
You know there's no spin there's no like

2549
02:20:30,336 --> 02:20:34,944
You know like normal propaganda is there during a different era

2550
02:20:35,200 --> 02:20:40,320
You're just twisting it

2551
02:20:40,576 --> 02:20:42,880
Fascist propaganda it's just like

2552
02:20:43,136 --> 02:20:43,648
Hey

2553
02:20:43,904 --> 02:20:45,440
They're the one starting the war

2554
02:20:46,720 --> 02:20:52,864
It is a little bit less creative

2555
02:20:53,120 --> 02:20:53,888
Ring and then we move on

2556
02:20:54,144 --> 02:20:58,752
Does suffer from a little bit of a lack of like I said creativity

2557
02:20:59,008 --> 02:21:01,056
Exactly

2558
02:21:01,568 --> 02:21:03,616
You express your creativity and differ

2559
02:21:03,872 --> 02:21:06,176
Frontwave sometimes it's performance Fahrenheit

2560
02:21:08,224 --> 02:21:12,064
Is it planned about evolution

2561
02:21:22,048 --> 02:21:23,328
Wyclef dismantling

2562
02:21:23,584 --> 02:21:26,912
Communist

2563
02:21:27,424 --> 02:21:31,264
Kill somebody

2564
02:21:31,520 --> 02:21:33,056
Position

2565
02:21:40,224 --> 02:21:41,504
Which helps anyone

2566
02:21:44,832 --> 02:21:46,368
End

2567
02:21:47,648 --> 02:21:53,792
Christmas in July

2568
02:21:54,048 --> 02:21:58,912
Tell me that leftists are killing people for their dream managerial position

2569
02:21:59,168 --> 02:22:05,312
You know who left it there huge in the middle manager

2570
02:22:05,568 --> 02:22:08,128
Means like manager class within the communist

2571
02:22:08,384 --> 02:22:10,176
Sequoia Bureau or whatever

2572
02:22:12,224 --> 02:22:18,368
They're going to kill you

2573
02:22:18,624 --> 02:22:22,464
Their dreams aren't even that big dad

2574
02:22:22,720 --> 02:22:28,864
Express

2575
02:22:29,120 --> 02:22:35,264
Christmas in July sale

2576
02:22:35,520 --> 02:22:37,312
Late summer Christmas

2577
02:22:38,080 --> 02:22:41,408
So Alex is making a

2578
02:22:41,664 --> 02:22:42,176
Stop

2579
02:22:42,432 --> 02:22:46,784
Misrepresenting things around the protester in Austin

2580
02:22:47,040 --> 02:22:47,552
Shot

2581
02:22:48,576 --> 02:22:51,648
This is an invalidation of Alex's Second Amendment

2582
02:22:52,160 --> 02:22:56,256
Cuz he believes that Foster just holding a gun means that he was threatening

2583
02:22:56,512 --> 02:22:57,024
The person

2584
02:22:57,280 --> 02:22:58,304
And deserve

2585
02:22:58,560 --> 02:22:59,072
B shot

2586
02:23:00,864 --> 02:23:02,912
Shame on you from the position of

2587
02:23:05,216 --> 02:23:06,496
I think we should be allowed to grab

2588
02:23:06,752 --> 02:23:07,264
His guns from

2589
02:23:07,520 --> 02:23:12,128
Studio

2590
02:23:13,920 --> 02:23:15,712
Lies about this a little bit more

2591
02:23:15,968 --> 02:23:18,784
And

2592
02:23:19,040 --> 02:23:22,112
Touch on it cuz it hasn't really evolved much except for this

2593
02:23:22,624 --> 02:23:25,952
They have colds going around

2594
02:23:32,352 --> 02:23:34,912
Police headquarters

2595
02:23:36,960 --> 02:23:37,472
Last week

2596
02:23:39,008 --> 02:23:40,800
I got it blocked off

2597
02:23:46,176 --> 02:23:47,968
Turn himself in to police and was released

2598
02:23:49,248 --> 02:23:50,272
White

2599
02:23:52,064 --> 02:23:54,112
Leasing information

2600
02:23:54,368 --> 02:23:56,416
Any information has just

2601
02:23:56,672 --> 02:24:00,768
Determine that the guy who shot Foster must not be white

2602
02:24:01,024 --> 02:24:04,352
Why they haven't really suited there's a hundred other explanation

2603
02:24:04,608 --> 02:24:06,144
Transferwise

2604
02:24:06,400 --> 02:24:07,424
Be protected in this days

2605
02:24:07,680 --> 02:24:09,216
Wyoming a white hats

2606
02:24:10,240 --> 02:24:15,104
To make it there is no real reason to release his name at this point given

2607
02:24:15,360 --> 02:24:17,664
I don't know if it's suspect

2608
02:24:18,176 --> 02:24:24,320
Or what the exact terminology you're not looking for them because they already turned themselves

2609
02:24:24,576 --> 02:24:25,856
Appeared at the station so

2610
02:24:26,368 --> 02:24:32,512
Releasing the names of the public doesn't help you find

2611
02:24:32,768 --> 02:24:33,792
Going to charge them

2612
02:24:34,048 --> 02:24:38,144
So assuming that you do the investigation and find no wrong

2613
02:24:38,400 --> 02:24:39,680
Want

2614
02:24:39,936 --> 02:24:40,704
Say

2615
02:24:40,960 --> 02:24:47,104
Put their entire business on national news and make sure that every single person on the planet knows who they

2616
02:24:47,360 --> 02:24:51,200
Reasons to defend privacy in this instance

2617
02:24:51,456 --> 02:24:54,016
From the perspective of the police station by train

2618
02:24:54,272 --> 02:24:55,808
With no information because he

2619
02:24:56,064 --> 02:24:56,832
He's a huge racist

2620
02:24:57,088 --> 02:25:00,672
Has decided that he doesn't fit the narrative but it was a white person

2621
02:25:01,952 --> 02:25:02,464
You who it is

2622
02:25:02,720 --> 02:25:03,232
That sounds right

2623
02:25:03,744 --> 02:25:07,328
This is classic white supremacist white nationalist

2624
02:25:08,352 --> 02:25:10,144
So Alex

2625
02:25:11,424 --> 02:25:12,192
And this is really funny

2626
02:25:12,960 --> 02:25:14,240
Because Alex mentions

2627
02:25:14,752 --> 02:25:15,264
Something

2628
02:25:15,776 --> 02:25:20,640
And that is the Rodger was involved in the 2000 election

2629
02:25:20,896 --> 02:25:26,272
Brooks Brothers

2630
02:25:26,528 --> 02:25:28,320
Yeah but you mentioned it

2631
02:25:28,576 --> 02:25:31,648
And then immediately realizes he's not supposed to like

2632
02:25:34,464 --> 02:25:35,744
He was there in 2000

2633
02:25:36,000 --> 02:25:37,536
In the contested election in

2634
02:25:37,792 --> 02:25:39,328
Florida between Gore and

2635
02:25:39,840 --> 02:25:42,400
Of course bus you successfully helped get bush in so

2636
02:25:46,240 --> 02:25:47,008
Internet the rapper

2637
02:25:48,800 --> 02:25:49,568
Stone

2638
02:25:53,408 --> 02:25:58,528
Is Rodger Stone

2639
02:25:58,784 --> 02:26:01,600
Savor that

2640
02:26:01,856 --> 02:26:08,000
God

2641
02:26:08,256 --> 02:26:12,864
You know that you're talking to somebody that you're early and most of your careers based around like

2642
02:26:13,120 --> 02:26:15,680
He was involved in something that you thought was a coup

2643
02:26:15,936 --> 02:26:18,496
Overthrowing the public

2644
02:26:18,752 --> 02:26:22,592
In a certain sense you literally just blamed rogerstone for 911

2645
02:26:24,896 --> 02:26:25,920
My bad buddy

2646
02:26:27,200 --> 02:26:27,712
That's so

2647
02:26:27,968 --> 02:26:28,736
F****** stupid

2648
02:26:28,992 --> 02:26:30,016
I hate him so much

2649
02:26:30,528 --> 02:26:32,832
It just doesn't mean anything nothing means anything

2650
02:26:35,648 --> 02:26:36,928
Talking about

2651
02:26:37,440 --> 02:26:40,768
Result is going to be

2652
02:26:43,840 --> 02:26:44,864
That's clear to me

2653
02:26:52,800 --> 02:26:55,104
To reserve his ability to

2654
02:26:55,360 --> 02:26:56,128
Illegally

2655
02:26:56,384 --> 02:26:59,968
I believe the next election

2656
02:27:05,344 --> 02:27:06,624
The entire issue

2657
02:27:08,416 --> 02:27:14,048
Yeah what the president has done is really brilliant to find ways around a legitimate election

2658
02:27:14,304 --> 02:27:17,120
End the pretense of Define legitimate election

2659
02:27:17,376 --> 02:27:20,960
California and urban areas are going to be illegitimate

2660
02:27:21,216 --> 02:27:27,360
No matter what

2661
02:27:27,872 --> 02:27:28,640
So

2662
02:27:29,920 --> 02:27:30,944
In this next clip

2663
02:27:31,200 --> 02:27:32,480
Alex is like a rock

2664
02:27:33,248 --> 02:27:34,272
Why don't you tell

2665
02:27:34,528 --> 02:27:35,040
Trump something

2666
02:27:35,552 --> 02:27:36,832
You just say something on air

2667
02:27:37,088 --> 02:27:37,600
Trump

2668
02:27:37,856 --> 02:27:42,208
Aren't they supposed to be friends no no

2669
02:27:44,256 --> 02:27:46,560
Rodger Stone as a message to Donald Trump

2670
02:27:46,816 --> 02:27:47,840
What you say

2671
02:27:49,632 --> 02:27:53,728
Else you want to add to the offense

2672
02:27:54,752 --> 02:27:56,032
You take a big shot of espresso

2673
02:27:56,288 --> 02:27:57,824
Will you come back in 5 minutes

2674
02:27:58,336 --> 02:28:00,640
Rodger Stone Reese Trump on

2675
02:28:00,896 --> 02:28:01,664
2020

2676
02:28:01,920 --> 02:28:04,736
When we come back and Rodger sellers you going to get to

2677
02:28:04,992 --> 02:28:10,624
President-trump

2678
02:28:10,880 --> 02:28:16,512
I don't understand how he expects anyone to not like he's listening to not think like Rodger could talk

2679
02:28:16,768 --> 02:28:17,280
To Trump

2680
02:28:20,608 --> 02:28:22,400
Send him a quick task

2681
02:28:22,912 --> 02:28:24,704
Oh no

2682
02:28:24,960 --> 02:28:29,056
Get on Infowars and Alex

2683
02:28:29,312 --> 02:28:29,824
Because of the gray

2684
02:28:30,080 --> 02:28:30,848
Listeners

2685
02:28:31,104 --> 02:28:31,616
This is

2686
02:28:31,872 --> 02:28:32,384
Childish

2687
02:28:33,664 --> 02:28:35,968
So anyway

2688
02:28:36,224 --> 02:28:40,320
Say a whole lot more of them

2689
02:28:40,576 --> 02:28:44,160
Love it is also just him trying to sell a shirt

2690
02:28:44,416 --> 02:28:45,696
Cuz he wants to appeal his case

2691
02:28:45,952 --> 02:28:48,256
I need the million dollars to appeal his case

2692
02:28:49,792 --> 02:28:52,352
Great that's a great group

2693
02:28:59,008 --> 02:29:00,544
That's still good

2694
02:29:00,800 --> 02:29:03,872
Is

2695
02:29:04,896 --> 02:29:05,920
Rodger Warren

2696
02:29:06,176 --> 02:29:08,480
Trump to not submit to a debate

2697
02:29:08,736 --> 02:29:14,880
Which is funny considering that all of these people keep yelling about how they left

2698
02:29:18,464 --> 02:29:21,280
Amazing

2699
02:29:27,680 --> 02:29:30,240
Schedule

2700
02:29:31,776 --> 02:29:32,288
Presidential

2701
02:29:32,544 --> 02:29:33,824
Commission on the base

2702
02:29:34,080 --> 02:29:35,872
Because it is

2703
02:29:36,128 --> 02:29:38,688
It is not a connection

2704
02:29:42,016 --> 02:29:44,320
Where and when

2705
02:29:53,024 --> 02:29:55,072
Is the presidential commission

2706
02:30:01,472 --> 02:30:03,264
When the moderator is in the chat

2707
02:30:03,776 --> 02:30:04,544
So you see

2708
02:30:04,800 --> 02:30:06,848
When Trump doesn't debate its

2709
02:30:07,104 --> 02:30:09,408
Strength when weak

2710
02:30:09,664 --> 02:30:10,688
Can I see it's fascist

2711
02:30:10,944 --> 02:30:12,224
Propaganda

2712
02:30:12,480 --> 02:30:12,992
Pinterest

2713
02:30:17,088 --> 02:30:18,112
You're not loud

2714
02:30:18,368 --> 02:30:20,160
Keyboard

2715
02:30:20,416 --> 02:30:26,560
Pops Pops out another guest

2716
02:30:28,352 --> 02:30:29,632
Millie Weaver

2717
02:30:31,424 --> 02:30:35,520
Because apparently there's developments with her Sunrise movement

2718
02:30:40,384 --> 02:30:42,176
Now he's very stupid

2719
02:30:42,432 --> 02:30:44,736
Alex

2720
02:30:44,992 --> 02:30:47,296
Asserting something

2721
02:30:48,832 --> 02:30:49,856
During this episode

2722
02:30:50,112 --> 02:30:51,136
Disclaim

2723
02:30:52,160 --> 02:30:55,744
Might be legally actionable and in no way does Alex

2724
02:30:56,000 --> 02:31:00,352
Back us up at all until

2725
02:31:07,520 --> 02:31:10,592
Courthouses in thousand

2726
02:31:10,848 --> 02:31:12,128
Illegal, to check point

2727
02:31:13,152 --> 02:31:16,992
We now have major leftist groups funded by Soros the Democrats

2728
02:31:17,760 --> 02:31:19,296
Sunrise movement

2729
02:31:21,600 --> 02:31:22,112
Please call me

2730
02:31:23,392 --> 02:31:25,440
Rogers Collegewood High School

2731
02:31:27,744 --> 02:31:29,024
Carry-out violent

2732
02:31:29,280 --> 02:31:30,304
These are all malice

2733
02:31:30,816 --> 02:31:32,864
Use 4 gauge you think your child's joining

2734
02:31:36,448 --> 02:31:38,240
And then I get programmed online

2735
02:31:38,752 --> 02:31:42,592
By the last two carryout sexual blackmail that's on video

2736
02:31:43,360 --> 02:31:44,384
Communist attacks

2737
02:31:44,896 --> 02:31:46,176
We have footage of this

2738
02:31:46,432 --> 02:31:48,736
Gordon inside the zoom meeting

2739
02:31:48,992 --> 02:31:49,760
And so they are

2740
02:31:50,784 --> 02:31:52,064
Activating your organization

2741
02:31:54,368 --> 02:31:55,904
Absolutely unsubstantiated

2742
02:31:56,160 --> 02:31:56,928
Alright

2743
02:31:57,440 --> 02:31:58,464
Children

2744
02:31:58,720 --> 02:32:04,864
Gather round we're going to talk about the high today

2745
02:32:05,120 --> 02:32:10,496
Does the idea that kids hit people with hammers

2746
02:32:11,776 --> 02:32:12,544
Alex

2747
02:32:12,800 --> 02:32:15,360
The only kid Racine hit people with hammers has been on it

2748
02:32:17,408 --> 02:32:18,176
Adult

2749
02:32:19,456 --> 02:32:22,528
Alex will bring that up over and over and over and over and over again

2750
02:32:22,784 --> 02:32:27,648
Dad about how this video is them telling people to hit people and conservatives with hammers

2751
02:32:28,928 --> 02:32:29,952
Payoff to that

2752
02:32:30,208 --> 02:32:30,976
Is amazing

2753
02:32:32,000 --> 02:32:32,768
It's so

2754
02:32:33,024 --> 02:32:33,536
Stupid

2755
02:32:34,048 --> 02:32:35,584
Before we get to that

2756
02:32:36,096 --> 02:32:37,888
Alex plays a little bit of the video

2757
02:32:38,144 --> 02:32:40,704
Cuz Millie Weaver Skype stops working

2758
02:32:40,960 --> 02:32:47,104
And so they play a little bit of Zoom call

2759
02:32:48,128 --> 02:32:50,176
That what it is is people talking about a plan

2760
02:32:50,432 --> 02:32:51,456
Demonstration

2761
02:32:51,712 --> 02:32:52,224
That was too

2762
02:32:52,480 --> 02:32:58,368
Keeps like Mitch McConnell up really late to his house and make a bunch of noise

2763
02:32:58,624 --> 02:33:04,768
Cuz like if we can't sleep like no justice no sleep right

2764
02:33:05,024 --> 02:33:08,608
Sleep troubles to be really scary

2765
02:33:08,864 --> 02:33:10,656
Well don't

2766
02:33:10,912 --> 02:33:11,680
Lead a genocide

2767
02:33:12,448 --> 02:33:12,960
So

2768
02:33:13,728 --> 02:33:16,032
If you if you listen to it it's very clear that's

2769
02:33:16,288 --> 02:33:17,312
The

2770
02:33:17,824 --> 02:33:18,336
Contacts

2771
02:33:18,592 --> 02:33:19,616
Around what they're talking

2772
02:33:19,872 --> 02:33:22,688
I'm about his car

2773
02:33:23,200 --> 02:33:25,760
Justice no sleep or Wide Awake

2774
02:33:26,272 --> 02:33:27,552
Protesters even showed up

2775
02:33:40,096 --> 02:33:41,376
I want to run your life

2776
02:33:41,632 --> 02:33:44,960
There is a perfect encapsulation of Alex's races

2777
02:33:45,216 --> 02:33:51,360
He sees this young woman

2778
02:33:51,616 --> 02:33:52,384
Generation

2779
02:33:52,640 --> 02:33:55,200
And for no other reason than the fact that she's not

2780
02:33:55,456 --> 02:33:57,248
Implies that she's not from America

2781
02:33:58,016 --> 02:34:03,136
He knows nothing about her than what he can tell visually and perhaps even the non-white person to something

2782
02:34:03,392 --> 02:34:05,696
You associate with them not being from here

2783
02:34:05,952 --> 02:34:09,536
With them not having the same rights to speak out or Advocate change

2784
02:34:09,792 --> 02:34:10,816
It's someone who looks like

2785
02:34:11,072 --> 02:34:11,584
Like himself.

2786
02:34:12,608 --> 02:34:14,400
This is very consistent and Alex's rhetoric

2787
02:34:15,168 --> 02:34:20,032
Use a ton of lip service to all the points that he has to hit like saying that we all have red blood

2788
02:34:20,288 --> 02:34:23,616
He's careful to not say racial slurs for the most part

2789
02:34:23,872 --> 02:34:28,480
Keep does not believe that people have the same right to be in this country

2790
02:34:28,736 --> 02:34:29,760
And to be treated as equals

2791
02:34:30,528 --> 02:34:35,392
Alex sees everyone as members of the groups that he can visually determine and treat differently

2792
02:34:35,904 --> 02:34:41,024
He sees women in her job is at the pool supply store at experiences at as as a sign

2793
02:34:41,280 --> 02:34:42,304
The Muslims are refusing

2794
02:34:42,560 --> 02:34:43,072
To assimilate

2795
02:34:43,840 --> 02:34:47,936
Eatzi's division on white woman discussion protest outside Mitch McConnell's house

2796
02:34:48,192 --> 02:34:50,752
And he experiences at as her being someone

2797
02:34:51,008 --> 02:34:55,872
The white people were nice enough to let into the country who's being ungrateful

2798
02:34:56,640 --> 02:34:57,920
This is not a small point

2799
02:34:58,432 --> 02:35:00,992
Do Alex Mike think that slip-up is kind of minor

2800
02:35:01,504 --> 02:35:05,088
It actually reveals a whole lot about how his mind operates subconsciously

2801
02:35:05,600 --> 02:35:09,184
He has an ingrained belief that non-white people don't belong in America

2802
02:35:09,440 --> 02:35:10,976
And the ones who are here should be thankful

2803
02:35:11,232 --> 02:35:13,024
That white people allowed them to be here

2804
02:35:14,304 --> 02:35:16,864
To go along with whatever circumstances they find themselves

2805
02:35:17,632 --> 02:35:21,216
Put simply on a deep level Alex doesn't believe in equal rights

2806
02:35:21,472 --> 02:35:22,240
In this country

2807
02:35:22,752 --> 02:35:24,544
He believes in a white nationalist state

2808
02:35:26,336 --> 02:35:32,480
It's clear I made just things like that are so I've just got nothing to say

2809
02:35:32,736 --> 02:35:34,272
The country you don't know anything about where she

2810
02:35:34,528 --> 02:35:35,040
He's from

2811
02:35:35,296 --> 02:35:36,320
You know anything about

2812
02:35:37,088 --> 02:35:37,856
It's not a dog whistle

2813
02:35:38,112 --> 02:35:38,880
The screen it is

2814
02:35:39,136 --> 02:35:40,416
100-percent

2815
02:35:41,184 --> 02:35:43,744
So Milly is talkin about the zoom call

2816
02:35:44,256 --> 02:35:48,352
From everything that they've provided is just people talking about a protest

2817
02:35:48,864 --> 02:35:51,168
Outside Mitch McConnell's house to keep him awake

2818
02:35:51,680 --> 02:35:54,752
Maybe even some other places but with the strategy

2819
02:35:55,008 --> 02:35:57,824
Can people off in order to

2820
02:35:58,080 --> 02:35:58,592
To take your

2821
02:35:58,848 --> 02:35:59,872
Your point seriously

2822
02:36:00,384 --> 02:36:01,664
Millie is so

2823
02:36:01,920 --> 02:36:02,432
Goddamn dumb

2824
02:36:03,200 --> 02:36:04,992
Interesting

2825
02:36:07,552 --> 02:36:10,368
Cremation of care

2826
02:36:13,696 --> 02:36:16,000
Is it

2827
02:36:20,096 --> 02:36:24,192
Is it

2828
02:36:25,728 --> 02:36:27,776
Call Dave

2829
02:36:28,032 --> 02:36:31,616
The Cremation of care ceremony historically has been held on the exact same

2830
02:36:33,408 --> 02:36:33,920
I don't know why

2831
02:36:36,224 --> 02:36:38,016
Always happens 100 days before they

2832
02:36:38,528 --> 02:36:39,040
When the planet

2833
02:36:40,064 --> 02:36:42,368
Yeah that that that's probably

2834
02:36:46,208 --> 02:36:48,512
The sunrise movement

2835
02:36:49,536 --> 02:36:52,864
Young women

2836
02:36:53,120 --> 02:36:54,400
Please

2837
02:36:54,656 --> 02:36:55,168
Cruise

2838
02:37:02,848 --> 02:37:03,360
Call Shanghai

2839
02:37:03,872 --> 02:37:04,384
Instagram

2840
02:37:19,744 --> 02:37:24,608
But now

2841
02:37:25,888 --> 02:37:28,704
Mark your house and go to Cleburne on you

2842
02:37:29,216 --> 02:37:30,240
This is

2843
02:37:30,496 --> 02:37:31,520
This is really

2844
02:37:31,776 --> 02:37:32,288
Depressing

2845
02:37:32,544 --> 02:37:34,592
Video plays

2846
02:37:37,408 --> 02:37:39,200
Are there they are with their hamburgers

2847
02:37:39,712 --> 02:37:40,992
It's like people with

2848
02:37:41,248 --> 02:37:44,064
Pots and pans

2849
02:37:44,320 --> 02:37:50,464
There is nothing video that says brick hammers to hit people it's all entirely based on

2850
02:37:50,720 --> 02:37:52,000
A couple of shots of people

2851
02:37:52,256 --> 02:37:53,536
Look actually like

2852
02:38:04,288 --> 02:38:09,664
Hammers

2853
02:38:09,920 --> 02:38:16,064
Look it look on one side we have the heroes the men decked out in military gear with

2854
02:38:16,320 --> 02:38:18,880
A r n e

2855
02:38:19,136 --> 02:38:25,280
They can identify them with their faces completely covered in only their eyes visible firing.

2856
02:38:25,792 --> 02:38:26,816
Non-lethal munizzi

2857
02:38:27,072 --> 02:38:27,584
Munitions

2858
02:38:32,448 --> 02:38:35,520
On one side and on the other you have these people with

2859
02:38:36,800 --> 02:38:38,336
A spoon in a pan damn

2860
02:38:39,104 --> 02:38:44,224
They are training your children to disagree with the guys who have all the guns

2861
02:38:44,480 --> 02:38:45,760
Terrible

2862
02:38:46,016 --> 02:38:52,160
Alarm injector position where Alex is talking about how like we're all going to die we're past the point

2863
02:38:52,416 --> 02:38:55,488
No return MS-13 kill teams are showing up

2864
02:38:56,000 --> 02:39:02,144
And you need to 70 year old veteran you need to sacrifice yourself in a suicide mission against

2865
02:39:03,424 --> 02:39:06,752
And then he's like yeah

2866
02:39:07,008 --> 02:39:08,800
Is people with noise

2867
02:39:18,784 --> 02:39:24,928
I got some Intel from the Austin Police Department

2868
02:39:27,488 --> 02:39:29,024
So Apple

2869
02:39:29,280 --> 02:39:33,376
A reports a timpani on the ground

2870
02:39:33,632 --> 02:39:35,168
Decent

2871
02:39:35,424 --> 02:39:37,728
Track record of people who

2872
02:39:37,984 --> 02:39:42,592
Or at least inspired partially by Infowars causing damage in society

2873
02:39:43,104 --> 02:39:43,872
This would be

2874
02:39:44,384 --> 02:39:47,712
The most hilarious self-parody I can imagine a name

2875
02:39:47,968 --> 02:39:51,040
The real-world ramifications of this stuff

2876
02:39:51,552 --> 02:39:52,064
Scary

2877
02:39:52,576 --> 02:39:54,624
Now Millie's interviewees

2878
02:39:54,880 --> 02:39:55,392
A

2879
02:39:55,648 --> 02:39:56,160
Dud

2880
02:39:56,672 --> 02:39:57,440
What

2881
02:39:58,208 --> 02:40:02,304
But you usually bring such good

2882
02:40:02,560 --> 02:40:05,888
Sexual blackmail

2883
02:40:06,144 --> 02:40:06,912
The

2884
02:40:07,168 --> 02:40:07,936
Hammerhead

2885
02:40:08,192 --> 02:40:08,704
Is that

2886
02:40:14,080 --> 02:40:17,664
The all seeing eye gif

2887
02:40:18,176 --> 02:40:21,760
Vettery posted on Instagram that is just a like a neon sign of an

2888
02:40:22,016 --> 02:40:22,784
Eye-opening

2889
02:40:23,040 --> 02:40:26,624
It's like not even the central focus of the gif

2890
02:40:28,928 --> 02:40:29,696
It's a bit of a

2891
02:40:35,840 --> 02:40:40,960
You know I already told across I want to come in tonight 7292 special commercial-free live show how they're going to do it I'm too tired

2892
02:40:42,496 --> 02:40:43,008
Xbox

2893
02:40:46,080 --> 02:40:47,360
The reason I'm so tired is

2894
02:40:47,872 --> 02:40:49,152
All this preparation

2895
02:40:51,968 --> 02:40:58,112
Why I know their plan and it's so hard I'm so tired cuz I prepared all of his stuff

2896
02:40:58,368 --> 02:41:00,416
I just he says it

2897
02:41:00,928 --> 02:41:01,696
As a point of pride

2898
02:41:03,744 --> 02:41:09,632
Over and over again he starts to get WIC

2899
02:41:09,888 --> 02:41:16,032
I just going to tease it because if I don't I don't know it's not making a big enough deal of it and then everytime it

2900
02:41:17,056 --> 02:41:23,200
I haven't done my job everything I know everything

2901
02:41:23,456 --> 02:41:29,088
I'm so smart and I have the all seeing eye I know all that's going on but

2902
02:41:29,344 --> 02:41:30,880
Didn't tell you anyways I forgot

2903
02:41:31,392 --> 02:41:35,232
Just do your job and boss boss I understand that you're mad

2904
02:41:36,000 --> 02:41:39,584
Only doing 5% of my job to come in from 7 to 9

2905
02:41:39,840 --> 02:41:40,864
I have a counter-offer

2906
02:41:41,120 --> 02:41:41,888
I'm really tired

2907
02:41:42,144 --> 02:41:45,472
Look I only did 5% of the news

2908
02:41:45,728 --> 02:41:46,752
Because

2909
02:41:47,264 --> 02:41:53,408
I had to spend all my show talk about how you're going to have to kill people you're going to have to kill people What is the news got to do with that right

2910
02:41:53,920 --> 02:41:55,712
So we won last year from the 30th

2911
02:41:57,504 --> 02:41:58,016
I mean

2912
02:41:58,784 --> 02:42:00,064
This is dumb but

2913
02:42:00,320 --> 02:42:00,832
Why not

2914
02:42:08,000 --> 02:42:10,560
But I was always close to it

2915
02:42:12,096 --> 02:42:13,120
A bunch of stuff

2916
02:42:18,240 --> 02:42:19,520
But now to be here in the side guy

2917
02:42:21,568 --> 02:42:22,592
I think Alex

2918
02:42:22,848 --> 02:42:28,992
May have just been heavily implying that his family was into the general

2919
02:42:34,112 --> 02:42:34,624
I think

2920
02:42:34,880 --> 02:42:35,392
Maybe

2921
02:42:35,648 --> 02:42:37,696
I might be working on his life Theory

2922
02:42:37,952 --> 02:42:40,256
That Alex had a weird relatives

2923
02:42:40,512 --> 02:42:46,656
Who may be terrified him as a child Satan or something

2924
02:42:46,912 --> 02:42:47,936
Avista

2925
02:42:48,192 --> 02:42:50,240
Is maybe unresolved

2926
02:42:50,496 --> 02:42:56,640
Unprocessed feelings that he has about being a young child in a scary distant relative or some

2927
02:42:58,432 --> 02:42:58,944
The devil

2928
02:42:59,456 --> 02:43:03,296
Or something some sort of some sort of dealt with trauma

2929
02:43:03,552 --> 02:43:04,320
Surrounding

2930
02:43:04,832 --> 02:43:07,136
I would have no reason to assume that

2931
02:43:07,648 --> 02:43:10,208
Some of his family members went to the devil if he hadn't just said that

2932
02:43:12,512 --> 02:43:13,536
We're getting this all wrong

2933
02:43:14,048 --> 02:43:17,632
Here's what we've here's what's going on Dan I finally figured it out

2934
02:43:18,912 --> 02:43:19,424
First.

2935
02:43:19,936 --> 02:43:20,448
Devil's ivy

2936
02:43:21,216 --> 02:43:22,240
Devil's obviously

2937
02:43:24,288 --> 02:43:24,800
Now

2938
02:43:25,056 --> 02:43:25,568
Here's the other

2939
02:43:26,080 --> 02:43:27,104
Alright Alex

2940
02:43:27,360 --> 02:43:28,128
Doesn't know

2941
02:43:28,896 --> 02:43:31,200
The reality that the rest of us live in

2942
02:43:31,456 --> 02:43:33,248
Because we haven't made a deal with the Devil

2943
02:43:33,504 --> 02:43:36,832
We don't have race memory we don't have these DNA memories

2944
02:43:37,088 --> 02:43:39,136
Do you know why Alex does because

2945
02:43:39,392 --> 02:43:45,536
Thousands of years ago in the American South whenever they were allowed to roam free his ancestor made

2946
02:43:45,792 --> 02:43:47,072
Deal with the devil to live

2947
02:43:47,328 --> 02:43:50,656
Forever in Pakistan from firstborn son to firstborn son

2948
02:43:50,912 --> 02:43:57,056
And that line is under his never ended and now we are here with Alex Jones who is the only person who can see all of this

2949
02:43:57,312 --> 02:43:58,592
Because he's the only one who's at

2950
02:43:58,848 --> 02:44:04,224
Actually made a deal with the devil Dan this is true

2951
02:44:04,480 --> 02:44:10,624
This guy

2952
02:44:10,880 --> 02:44:12,160
The original global

2953
02:44:12,416 --> 02:44:18,560
Wow this is serious

2954
02:44:18,816 --> 02:44:21,120
Alex's the devil

2955
02:44:21,376 --> 02:44:23,936
Is family

2956
02:44:24,960 --> 02:44:31,104
Go down that poor guy I mean
