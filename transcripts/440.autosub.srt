1
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:18,944
Air Jordan

2
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:20,736
Knowledge party.com

3
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:27,136
I have great respect for its knowledge B I'm sick of imposing

4
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:08,352
Born in the wild

5
00:01:08,608 --> 00:01:10,912
What's up man

6
00:01:13,728 --> 00:01:19,872
Well it's most certainly I was getting ready for

7
00:01:20,128 --> 00:01:26,272
Department

8
00:01:26,528 --> 00:01:29,856
Qualifications for me to

9
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:36,512
Make more of a home as opposed to one of these transient flop Squad ending up in

10
00:01:36,768 --> 00:01:41,888
Usually they're filled with steak snakes and there's no Saint Patrick around three years

11
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:48,288
I found this place I really like

12
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:49,824
Fast I think it's good

13
00:01:50,336 --> 00:01:51,360
Because

14
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:54,176
Visited a number of places it just weren't

15
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:56,992
We're not up to

16
00:01:57,248 --> 00:01:58,528
Just be angry

17
00:01:58,784 --> 00:02:02,880
And it was really pretty.

18
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:04,672
And I was lucky

19
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:05,440
I guess I got lucky

20
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:06,208
Cuz it's just

21
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:07,744
Put in an application

22
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:08,768
Her back pretty quickly

23
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:17,472
Are we moving at the middle of this month

24
00:02:17,728 --> 00:02:23,872
I will be walking out the door as if I do

25
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:28,992
That might be part of the reason why I guess the generalized everything that's going on

26
00:02:29,248 --> 00:02:34,624
Thousands of people at Uptown

27
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:39,232
Smartstandard just kicked ass all over the place

28
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:42,304
So many people how many people is thousand

29
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:45,120
Genuinely inspiring

30
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:53,056
Because of everything that's going on I feel the obligation to stay in the present.

31
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:59,456
Alex the first

32
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:02,528
And 2nd of June 2020 bands of 2020

33
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:09,440
No I think there's one thing to talk about and then there's a lot of

34
00:03:09,696 --> 00:03:13,280
Little mini bulshit things that Alex is doing but I think

35
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:16,096
Seen a lot of similar trends

36
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:17,376
Continue on

37
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:21,472
Acceleration

38
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:22,496
There's a lot of

39
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:24,032
Intensification

40
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:25,568
Valances call for blood

41
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:30,432
Basically

42
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:36,832
There's a desire to rationalize the idea of trump using military against

43
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:43,488
You have those things and there's an interesting sort of push and pull that Alex is trying to do where you trying today

44
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:46,304
Pretend that he retains some of his principles

45
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,096
Now yelling for blood

46
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:49,632
But

47
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:51,424
We'll see how it plays out

48
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,728
Cortana show

49
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:57,824
Before we do got a show

50
00:03:58,336 --> 00:04:00,384
Call him am I think

51
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:03,200
C a g h a i n

52
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:05,248
Thank you so much you are now policy wonk

53
00:04:05,504 --> 00:04:06,272
I'm a policy wonk

54
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:09,600
Thank you

55
00:04:09,856 --> 00:04:11,392
Next

56
00:04:11,648 --> 00:04:12,672
Techy thank you so much

57
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:19,327
I'm a policy wonk

58
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:23,167
I'm a policy wonk Matthias be

59
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:24,447
Journal biology

60
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:33,151
I'm a policy wonk

61
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:38,015
Where am I

62
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:39,807
Policy wonk

63
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:46,975
I donated on elevated thank you so much

64
00:04:47,231 --> 00:04:50,815
You are now a technocrat

65
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:52,095
You're now a technocrat

66
00:04:58,239 --> 00:05:00,543
We got to go

67
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:03,871
Heroin

68
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:07,711
Chick-fil-A large

69
00:05:10,527 --> 00:05:14,111
Thinking about your body

70
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:22,559
Generosity

71
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:27,679
Bundle it up really nice and toss it over to Mutual Aid

72
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:31,775
Kind of situation to help people in your area and eat

73
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:38,175
I don't want to belabor this or spend too much time here but it

74
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:40,479
You know we if we stop

75
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:43,295
Doing here the Seltzer it will just at

76
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:47,391
So although these times are great and serious

77
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:50,975
Are we also still need to check in with the year of the

78
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:54,559
So not a lot of progress

79
00:05:57,119 --> 00:05:58,399
Great white plague

80
00:05:58,911 --> 00:06:02,239
Such a positive

81
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:03,263
Not much going on

82
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:08,639
How much progress in the year 96

83
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:09,407
Drink

84
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:13,759
This point today is recess

85
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:20,415
It's a god-like cdda

86
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:25,279
Take a break from your life

87
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:31,167
I got two varieties of recess one of them was a pomegranate hibiscus

88
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:32,703
Fantastic

89
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:36,031
77

90
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:36,799
Then

91
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:38,079
I tried

92
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:40,127
Their other one which was Peach Ginger

93
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:41,151
Peach Ginger

94
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:47,551
Disaster

95
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:53,951
It's strange to me that the companies are capable

96
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:55,743
Such Heights in such a nose

97
00:06:55,999 --> 00:07:02,143
Such as the recent

98
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:14,943
So so much

99
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:20,575
Thank you for the pomegranate and I may have another one of those at some point

100
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:22,879
Start here on June 1st

101
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:27,743
Alex

102
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:29,535
There's some big things happening

103
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:33,631
And Alex gets down to it here in this first

104
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:35,679
Savannah Hernandez

105
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:38,239
He's been here five years

106
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:46,175
He's now been accused by the Twitter mob of

107
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:47,967
He's the one that burned

108
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:52,063
Because when they're burning at 1 old Marine was almost cousins

109
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:52,831
Are you

110
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:55,647
Cockroaches

111
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:05,119
You done this because he just

112
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:15,615
The audience

113
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:22,015
Video of the man experiencing homelessness who had his mattress set on fire in Austin

114
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:27,391
And I chose not to include it on our episode that we put out on Monday for a specific reason

115
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:34,047
It was an editorial decision that I made because I tried to get to the bottom of what was going on in the video and I couldn't find any

116
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:40,191
In other cases the ambiguous video had some context clues that allowed me to get something of a grip on them

117
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:46,847
Like in the case of the brakes and ballast we know what building that video is in front of it we can discuss the idea of bricks being quiet

118
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:49,663
In the context of some surrounding Clues

119
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:53,247
The case of the video of the mattress fire was another thing altogether

120
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:59,903
All you had was Alex presenting a video of a mattress being bird and his claim that it was the protesters who set it on

121
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:01,951
Fire and other people saying Alex

122
00:09:02,719 --> 00:09:05,535
In that kind of situation I'm presented with a couple of options

123
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:12,447
The first is to accept Alex's framing of the story and work to explain how it's an isolated incident

124
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:15,263
Doesn't necessarily implicate the larger character the protest

125
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:20,895
This isn't a good option because it relies wholly on taking Alex's word about an unclear situation

126
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:22,431
It's usually unwise to do that

127
00:09:23,199 --> 00:09:26,783
The second option is to speculate that all is not what it appears to be

128
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:33,439
This could take the form of saying in 4th probably set the whole thing up or that it was the proud boys or any possible entity you could come up

129
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:34,463
Oyster Point the finger at

130
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:39,583
Big eruption feels better to someone who has the positions are beliefs I do

131
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:45,215
Because I hate to imagine that someone who would be associated with protests that I support believe in the closet

132
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:47,263
Would victimize a person experience

133
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:48,031
It's like that

134
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:48,799
It's ugly

135
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:54,431
And to avoid the feelings that that ugliness would bring up

136
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:55,967
Conclusion it with no evidence

137
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:58,015
Infowars stage the whole thing

138
00:09:58,783 --> 00:09:59,295
The third eye

139
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:01,087
Option in the one I took was to be cautious

140
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:03,135
And not discuss it until there was more

141
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:04,159
To go on

142
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:06,463
Isolated incidents of property damage

143
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:12,095
Even this this egregious are not so pressing the news-item that we should feel like we have to make unforced errors

144
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:18,495
By either making unfounded accusations of a false flag making a mistake was feeding the ground to Alexandra

145
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:19,519
Accepting is framing

146
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:21,567
Hope those are not winning solution

147
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:23,103
It's hard

148
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:28,991
And I fully understand people's impulse to craft a theory that Alex or Infowars did this to make protesters look bad

149
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:33,087
Bummer to watch people do this

150
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:38,207
I've heard a number of rationalizations for why someone would assume Alex was behind it

151
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:41,023
One is that he's capable of doing something like this

152
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:43,327
And I can see that he almost certainly is

153
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:47,167
And that if there were evidence that I wouldn't be surprised at all

154
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:52,031
Being capable of a false flag publicity stunt is not the same thing as actually doing

155
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:56,383
Another rationalization is that Alex lies all the time

156
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:57,919
It's fine to weaponize it

157
00:10:58,175 --> 00:10:59,199
Conspiracy against him

158
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:03,295
I have something important to say about anyone who might feel that way

159
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:08,159
I'm often unfairly accused of being gay when they go low we go high guy

160
00:11:08,415 --> 00:11:12,767
And I resent that and this is nothing even close to that in this case

161
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:19,935
Absolute proof that Infowars set this fire this is a conspiracy theory that some people are choosing to acceptance

162
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:21,471
Fact or likely fact

163
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:24,031
Because it helps them build a narrative more convenient

164
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:27,615
After three-and-a-half years of studying Alex Jones

165
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:30,175
I'm comfortable saying that this pattern of thinking

166
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:32,479
Of accepting conspiracies absent evidence

167
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:35,551
Is what made Alex Jones into Alex Jones

168
00:11:36,575 --> 00:11:39,135
We were show that's about this mentality and how it's corrosive

169
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:45,791
We primarily discuss this through the prism of Alex because he's the most flagrant an obvious example of someone who's become super

170
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:47,839
Whose entire career

171
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:48,607
Is based on

172
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:49,631
Conspiracy narrative

173
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:51,679
And building them out of things he cannot ever

174
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:52,959
Come close to prove it

175
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:57,823
But if you look at all the people that we covered that's essentially one of the big commonalities

176
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:04,735
Yeah

177
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:05,503
Do any

178
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:06,783
He doesn't make anything

179
00:12:07,039 --> 00:12:08,831
Thanks

180
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:14,463
Because all the things humpers shirts are probably stolen from some random person

181
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:17,023
He doesn't make anything other than lies

182
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:24,447
Conspiracy thinking this kind of s*** is a manifestation generally of laziness

183
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:30,079
Your processing case process the next time

184
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:32,895
And on some level this is why Alex suck so much

185
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:39,551
He's learned over the course of his career that he doesn't need to do better than just make something up and his audience will be trained to accept that level

186
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:44,159
If people are going to be opposed to that kind of information

187
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:46,463
Economy that the right-wing is thrust us into

188
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:50,303
Crucial that they don't become lazy themselves and just use the same tricks

189
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:56,191
This isn't because the tricks are inherently wrong it's because they're corrosive

190
00:12:56,703 --> 00:12:57,727
They work well

191
00:12:57,983 --> 00:13:00,799
Yeah you can smear people like crazy and it work

192
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:03,359
Yeah but they also hurt you when you use

193
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:05,407
These techniques are not

194
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:07,199
Are there bad for you

195
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:12,831
Naturally probably the less abstract consideration is that you can't prove

196
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:15,391
That Alex are Infowars started that fire

197
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:16,927
And if you can't

198
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:18,975
You might as well be working for Infowars

199
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:20,511
When you make that accusation

200
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:25,119
A Twitter account that posted this accusation got over 13,000 retweets

201
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:27,679
And a video on Twitter

202
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:33,055
25 million views

203
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:39,455
Stop it you getting tons and tons of repressed and guess what like I said if you can't prove that you've given him the perfect

204
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:42,271
You can point to this is a great piece of evidence

205
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:47,647
Set the media the last they always lie about him cuz he's always right about everything

206
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:53,279
Deconstructing in discussing this propaganda is on

207
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:54,047
Sing to me

208
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:58,911
It satisfies an intellectual curiosity and I like learning about f***** up

209
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:03,263
But on another level it's motivated by a desire to limit the Toxic effect

210
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:06,079
People like Alex have on the people they've indoctrinated

211
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:11,455
His worldview is nonsensical and his businesses exploitative to the people who've been tricked into following it

212
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:14,783
The Narrative change to suit Alex's needs and maximizes

213
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:15,551
Is Prophets

214
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:18,879
He's been on the verge both Victory and the globalist shutting them down

215
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:19,647
20 years

216
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:26,559
The reason that this kind of thing the accusation that Infowars at this guy's mattress on fire really really really rubbed me

217
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:27,327
Romwe

218
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:30,911
Is because it has the potential to expose a lot of people to Infowars

219
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:33,471
And also trick them into thinking that he's right

220
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:37,567
There's a decent chance

221
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:39,359
And convinced that they found true

222
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:44,479
Because of an unproven accusations of Infowars staged a new story acceptable

223
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:48,319
You you can't give him the opportunity to

224
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:50,367
Play the victim by mitten

225
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:54,719
Because then you amplify his message again

226
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:55,999
25 million views

227
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:59,327
You see all these people and if he proves himself correctly

228
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:01,887
Or even if there's no proof that he did it

229
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:04,447
He can absolutely play the victim

230
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:05,983
Amplifiers message

231
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:10,079
And when people see that he actually is the victim of something that's untrue

232
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:12,127
Or at least impossible to prove

233
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:17,247
They're going to be like well obviously this guy is right and they're going to pay more attention to him

234
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:18,783
It's it's awful

235
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:20,831
It's a trick he relies on stuff like this

236
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:24,927
And if you just deprive him of this kind of oxygen he won't be able

237
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:26,719
Much more difficult time

238
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:28,255
Having access to

239
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:30,559
Fertile Minds to corrupt

240
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:35,935
I mean it's it is very much like oh you say that it's fine to use his own tricks against him

241
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:37,471
But what you don't understand it

242
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:41,055
He's been telling people that you're using those tricks anyways

243
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:45,151
True you're not doing anything other than proving that you're using those

244
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:50,015
Also you're not going to

245
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:51,551
These tricks

246
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:57,951
25 years ago

247
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:02,559
You're going to feel bad at some point

248
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:11,775
I want to be clear to I can't say that he didn't do it I don't know if you

249
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:18,431
I don't know I watch the video bunch of times slowed down

250
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:23,807
Eventually something will come out that shows that can have the discussion

251
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:29,439
I've asked multiple people to provide any evidence that this was in forwards doing and the best anyone has

252
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:33,279
Is a blurry picture of a logo

253
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:34,559
Impossible to tell if it is

254
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:38,399
And I don't think it is a computer instead

255
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:39,167
Enhance

256
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:43,263
I usually that works on CSI

257
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:46,847
The other piece of evidence is that the man who owns the mattress approaches

258
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:49,919
The camera and says quote I live here what the f*** are you doing

259
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:56,575
To me this doesn't really prove that the man is accusing the camera person of burning the mattress considering that the people who brought the mattress to the

260
00:16:56,831 --> 00:16:57,343
Fire camp

261
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:58,367
Clearly different direction

262
00:16:58,623 --> 00:17:01,439
Confirm the camera it looks more like he was just yelling at the closest

263
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:03,231
It doesn't really prove anything

264
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:07,327
But those are the two pieces of evidence

265
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:09,375
I just don't accept those as

266
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:10,911
Solid evidence

267
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:17,311
Not to say that Alex is the king but this is a situation where you can't miss

268
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:19,871
You can't do stuff like this unless you know

269
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:20,639
I believe

270
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:22,175
He could have did it

271
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:26,527
But if you can't prove that you're

272
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:29,343
Yeah it's 142 plays into his hands

273
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:35,743
It's important to remember that the camera person here too and the people who throw the mattress in the fire are not associated in the

274
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:36,767
Video at all

275
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:41,119
And that there's no way the camera person would have an Infowars sign on them

276
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:45,983
Being accosted or yelled at so it's definitely a situation where they were in stealth mode

277
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:49,823
This guy would have known

278
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:51,615
I'll be wearing a f******

279
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:54,175
Little card in their hats

280
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:58,015
Run out of there so fast know what happened to the tank

281
00:17:58,527 --> 00:18:02,623
Is allowing somebody with an Infowars press badge on

282
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:08,255
Fox News

283
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:10,559
He didn't think they ran off

284
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:11,327
Alex's

285
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:14,399
What they do with the person who's just a person

286
00:18:14,655 --> 00:18:20,799
At the very least is that camera would be gone for like yelling at

287
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:22,079
That was not the case

288
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:27,455
40-gallon Infowars that don't require this kind of unforced error

289
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:30,015
And that don't play directly into Alex's Playbook

290
00:18:30,783 --> 00:18:36,927
This kind of thing just doesn't play and that's why I think the prudent decision in cases like this has to wait until there's more information

291
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:41,023
If it turns out to be Rogue protester acting reprehensible

292
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:44,095
You can discuss it on that front doesn't invalidate the

293
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:47,423
Larger protester the points of what's going on in the world

294
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:51,519
And you still then and you don't have to then see the ground to Infowars

295
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:52,287
Central position

296
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:56,127
And if it does turn out that there is evidence that Infowars dated

297
00:18:56,383 --> 00:18:56,895
You can have the

298
00:18:57,151 --> 00:18:59,455
Discussion formal responsibly because you can say

299
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:00,735
Here is why

300
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:03,295
I don't know I just I was

301
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:04,319
Nomad

302
00:19:05,599 --> 00:19:07,647
I was texting somebody

303
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:09,951
Don't understand

304
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:11,231
Why people I beat you

305
00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:12,767
It's not true I do

306
00:19:13,023 --> 00:19:13,791
Understand

307
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:18,143
I don't understand why people can't get to the second step and recognize like

308
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:19,935
This is going to be counterproductive

309
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:26,847
It feels good I don't know

310
00:19:27,103 --> 00:19:32,479
I guess we just accepted it so there's a massive population that's just going to do this

311
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:35,551
Let's all

312
00:19:36,063 --> 00:19:37,087
Do Irish

313
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:39,391
That's that's what I can say

314
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:46,047
Delta and Alex gift-wrapped propaganda terrorist

315
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:49,631
So in the next class Alex discusses how

316
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:50,911
Realize that we were weak

317
00:19:53,215 --> 00:19:53,727
This is at

318
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:54,751
And this is the deathclaw

319
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:57,823
All of the following political correctness

320
00:19:58,335 --> 00:20:00,639
Has maybe establishment believe that you

321
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:06,015
The goose is cooked

322
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:11,903
Full

323
00:20:16,511 --> 00:20:18,047
It just include attempts to kill the president

324
00:20:18,303 --> 00:20:18,815
It doesn't

325
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:21,119
Kill the whole thing and

326
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:25,215
So that's exciting

327
00:20:25,471 --> 00:20:30,847
Episode

328
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:34,687
What will I think this is probably part of it

329
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:35,967
That is it

330
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:38,015
Through all this

331
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:42,111
You know what's coming to know what you got to do you have to understand that your enemies are

332
00:20:42,623 --> 00:20:44,415
I'm going to still say it's the murderer

333
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:45,695
No no

334
00:20:45,951 --> 00:20:46,463
Your enemies

335
00:20:46,975 --> 00:20:51,071
He has to recognize and they're not human

336
00:20:51,327 --> 00:20:53,119
If you want to start a campaign is the murder hornet

337
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:54,143
It's that is your business

338
00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:55,935
Stay out of it

339
00:20:56,191 --> 00:21:00,287
Murder Hornet how cool is Jordan

340
00:21:01,311 --> 00:21:02,335
Northeast

341
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:04,639
Doolittle beardie axle

342
00:21:05,407 --> 00:21:06,943
These are scientifically evil

343
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:07,967
People committed

344
00:21:11,551 --> 00:21:12,063
Destruction

345
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:15,135
As soon as you wake up

346
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:16,159
After that you'll be able to

347
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:17,952
Do you realize you're dealing with

348
00:21:18,464 --> 00:21:19,232
Homicidal

349
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:21,280
You don't have a dad

350
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:23,840
Okay so that's all

351
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:24,608
Call coming out

352
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:38,432
Double down because things are so insane

353
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:44,320
That means it's time to sell

354
00:21:44,576 --> 00:21:49,184
Things going on in the world unless I'm getting people really riled up

355
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:52,000
Big Move

356
00:21:52,256 --> 00:21:53,024
I know I can move to

357
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:53,792
The product

358
00:21:54,048 --> 00:21:55,328
Get the good sales going

359
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:58,144
Also goes to f****** it disgraceful mess of like

360
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:03,008
You have to recognize that your enemies are evil and then you can win also by the way I got to tell you

361
00:22:03,264 --> 00:22:06,080
Well you got to get those pills out of there

362
00:22:06,336 --> 00:22:08,896
Spilled out of there so he can

363
00:22:09,152 --> 00:22:11,712
You can

364
00:22:11,968 --> 00:22:12,480
Not

365
00:22:12,736 --> 00:22:16,576
Fight globalist without an empty Warehouse

366
00:22:16,832 --> 00:22:22,976
How many times do I have to tell you this

367
00:22:23,232 --> 00:22:29,120
Empty Warehouse okay alright middle 12

368
00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:35,008
So Alex is a big story about coronavirus covid-19

369
00:22:35,264 --> 00:22:37,312
And it gets to admit next Club

370
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:38,592
Should we start

371
00:22:40,896 --> 00:22:41,408
Second

372
00:22:42,432 --> 00:22:43,456
Let me just a single

373
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:47,808
The German interior Ministry

374
00:22:48,064 --> 00:22:49,600
Pamela pop scientist

375
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:53,440
And I came out instead

376
00:22:53,952 --> 00:22:54,464
It is

377
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:58,816
Normal seasonal Desperado things about attributed to it

378
00:22:59,584 --> 00:23:00,864
And it's just a cold virus

379
00:23:03,168 --> 00:23:04,192
Destroyed civilization

380
00:23:04,448 --> 00:23:04,960
Cannon Society

381
00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:08,800
Alarm

382
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:10,592
False alarm

383
00:23:10,848 --> 00:23:16,992
Is an alleged leaked report that a German official released recently that says that the fear of

384
00:23:17,248 --> 00:23:23,392
Covid-19 might have been overstated

385
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:29,280
And honestly I can't find coverage of this alleged leak on any website that looks reputable at all

386
00:23:29,536 --> 00:23:33,632
And none of them even linked to the actual suppose League's reports I have no idea about this

387
00:23:33,888 --> 00:23:38,496
I have no idea if this is a real things it's kind of tough for me to respond even if it

388
00:23:38,752 --> 00:23:42,592
I'd like presumably I'm going to give the benefit of the doubt and assume it's not made up

389
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:45,152
Entirely

390
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:46,176
I can't read it

391
00:23:50,016 --> 00:23:52,576
I don't know I'm going to go ahead and err on the side of

392
00:23:53,088 --> 00:23:55,136
Not taking Alex's word on this

393
00:23:56,928 --> 00:24:00,512
No scientific report

394
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:02,560
About covid-19 read a lot of stuff

395
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:05,376
But no matter how many scientific reports I read

396
00:24:05,632 --> 00:24:11,520
None of them agree with my conclusions 100% you know I'm going to get something wrong

397
00:24:11,776 --> 00:24:17,920
It's very odd for a scientific report agree with every narrative that Alex puts

398
00:24:18,176 --> 00:24:20,224
At least one

399
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,016
Well it turns out it was

400
00:24:22,272 --> 00:24:23,808
Exasperation

401
00:24:31,232 --> 00:24:34,304
His made-up story about the stories about

402
00:24:34,816 --> 00:24:35,840
Alleged leak.

403
00:24:36,096 --> 00:24:42,240
See if I can find it eventually but I have no idea

404
00:24:42,752 --> 00:24:45,312
Has proved that everything about coronavirus

405
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:47,104
Is Big a hoax

406
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,384
There we go

407
00:24:51,712 --> 00:24:52,736

Still not

410
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,064
Still not further

411
00:24:58,368 --> 00:25:04,512
That will they go where where is their headquarters what's Silicon Valley

412
00:25:04,768 --> 00:25:05,536
Tell you there is one

413
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,376
Terrorist groups

414
00:25:09,888 --> 00:25:10,912
Shutdown

415
00:25:17,312 --> 00:25:19,104
Violence

416
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,640
For political or economic

417
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:22,432
Definition of it

418
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:23,712
Cobra Commander

419
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,552

420
00:25:28,064 --> 00:25:28,832
Thunder record

421
00:25:30,624 --> 00:25:31,648
Under organized crime

422
00:25:32,672 --> 00:25:34,720
With their radios

423
00:25:35,232 --> 00:25:35,744
Accused

424
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:36,768
Reels

425
00:25:38,048 --> 00:25:38,560
Forest

426
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:40,608
Documents two years ago

427
00:25:41,888 --> 00:25:44,448
All hell broke loose Burroughs financing lawsuits against

428
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,800
We meet Hitler were going to be

429
00:25:49,312 --> 00:25:53,152
I just can't stress this enough with Alex said anything better

430
00:25:53,408 --> 00:25:53,920
You wouldn't

431
00:25:54,176 --> 00:25:56,480
Constantly bring up these stupid document

432
00:25:56,736 --> 00:26:02,624
It's a symbol of how weak his arguments are constantly fall back

433
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:03,648
They have a headquarters

434
00:26:03,904 --> 00:26:08,512
The community commanded by Alexander store was based on some dumb s*** I found on 4chan

435
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:14,912
You might as well just be some idiot fourteen-year-old telling you about what he read on a Blog communicative message

436
00:26:15,168 --> 00:26:20,032
Board nonsense

437
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:22,080
Also let's organize

438
00:26:22,336 --> 00:26:24,896
A rubber ducky Smokey is coming through

439
00:26:25,152 --> 00:26:26,688
Amos-4 organizing

440
00:26:26,944 --> 00:26:27,456
Politically

441
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:29,248
They're really a get-out-the-vote

442
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:30,016
Organization

443
00:26:30,272 --> 00:26:30,784
Sure

444
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:37,184
So we could talk in a little bit more about these documents here

445
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:37,952
Over and over again

446
00:26:39,488 --> 00:26:40,512
2015

447
00:26:41,024 --> 00:26:42,048
Play martial law in Maryland

448
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:44,608
The police captain

449
00:26:50,496 --> 00:26:51,264
Marylanders

450
00:26:53,056 --> 00:26:53,568
Baltimore

451
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,920
Riot triggering a nationwide up

452
00:26:59,712 --> 00:27:00,480
That's why Democrats

453
00:27:01,504 --> 00:27:02,272
100 are promoting

454
00:27:02,784 --> 00:27:03,296
And saying it's good

455
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:04,832
Endorsing it

456
00:27:06,368 --> 00:27:07,136
What day

457
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:07,904
1

458
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:14,304
Democratic Governors and Mayors are endorsing everything that's going on

459
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:16,864
See you but you don't answer mean

460
00:27:17,632 --> 00:27:23,264
They work for Alexandra Stewart

461
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:26,592
Milgard grave

462
00:27:26,848 --> 00:27:28,128
Troops everywhere I need

463
00:27:28,384 --> 00:27:34,528
Humvees armored I need those down there because I really endorse the message of these protests

464
00:27:34,784 --> 00:27:37,344
Setting absurd curfews

465
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,648
Military grade weapons

466
00:27:39,904 --> 00:27:44,512
Pointed at the citizens of my state because I support them

467
00:27:44,768 --> 00:27:46,560
Yeah it seems a little convoluted

468
00:27:46,816 --> 00:27:49,376
So Alex says the time

469
00:27:50,144 --> 00:27:52,448
You know where I'm going to get down to it eventually

470
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:55,008
What's coming next

471
00:27:56,544 --> 00:27:57,312
Controlling myself

472
00:27:58,336 --> 00:27:58,848
Last segment

473
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:01,152
Bubba sour

474
00:28:12,928 --> 00:28:13,696
Finish this

475
00:28:13,952 --> 00:28:14,464
Play out the

476
00:28:21,632 --> 00:28:22,400
Argue that all day long

477
00:28:27,264 --> 00:28:28,032
Almost

478
00:28:40,832 --> 00:28:42,112
Let me show you what really went on

479
00:28:42,624 --> 00:28:48,256
It wasn't all over the news on Twitter tweeting stuff about that irresponsible

480
00:28:48,512 --> 00:28:51,840
What's all over the news and also the Democrats didn't do anything

481
00:28:52,608 --> 00:28:54,912
What are you talkin about

482
00:28:55,168 --> 00:28:57,728
That was Nancy Pelosi in those videos

483
00:28:57,984 --> 00:29:03,616
Personally doing I could see that cash it's also

484
00:29:03,872 --> 00:29:06,176
Do that

485
00:29:06,688 --> 00:29:11,552
Just getting ready to head to the hills though cuz it was just starting to get to that get to worrying him a little bit

486
00:29:15,904 --> 00:29:16,928
Because I want to run

487
00:29:18,208 --> 00:29:20,512
But if Americans are so soft and so stupid

488
00:29:22,816 --> 00:29:23,584
Can't stop this

489
00:29:29,728 --> 00:29:31,264
Rob Russia in

490
00:29:31,776 --> 00:29:32,288
1517

491
00:29:33,824 --> 00:29:34,336
Why was Austin awake

492
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,664
The party's over funk

493
00:29:38,688 --> 00:29:39,200
Unless

494
00:29:39,968 --> 00:29:40,736
Globalist

495
00:29:47,392 --> 00:29:48,416
Trump decisive

496
00:29:50,464 --> 00:29:55,840
Anybody who was born in 1917 is 103 right now

497
00:30:02,496 --> 00:30:08,640
The lieutenant governor said that he want to be elderly to sacrifice themselves for the economy this is the greatest sacrifice

498
00:30:08,896 --> 00:30:09,920
Fight

499
00:30:10,176 --> 00:30:12,480
3 years old I don't know

500
00:30:12,736 --> 00:30:16,320
Balloon

501
00:30:16,576 --> 00:30:20,160
House of War

502
00:30:20,672 --> 00:30:25,024
And if you listen to Alex's show expression has a very specific

503
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,048
You

504
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:29,888
80 Temple Derry Ono

505
00:30:30,144 --> 00:30:33,216
Now although I like it is a like ethology

506
00:30:33,472 --> 00:30:36,032
No it's specifically used

507
00:30:36,288 --> 00:30:37,312
To talk about Islam

508
00:30:37,568 --> 00:30:42,944
Used to say that Muslims believe that any Muslim control care territory is

509
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,224
The house of peace

510
00:30:50,624 --> 00:30:56,768
Horrible misunderstanding of something

511
00:30:57,024 --> 00:31:03,168
Video of God dammit

512
00:31:05,472 --> 00:31:07,776
That is a phrase that Alex is using

513
00:31:08,288 --> 00:31:12,384
And because I know that he only uses that expression in those terms

514
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:15,968
He's essentially saying we're at a point where you should go kill

515
00:31:16,224 --> 00:31:18,784
Like he's he's saying the terrorist Act

516
00:31:19,552 --> 00:31:24,928
Are acceptable the only way we win is to decapitate the globalist

517
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:27,232
But I don't want to do that and neither

518
00:31:27,488 --> 00:31:29,536
Should you as anything other than

519
00:31:30,816 --> 00:31:32,096
Well we should be killed

520
00:31:42,592 --> 00:31:44,384
The only way to win so you want to win

521
00:31:44,896 --> 00:31:46,176
I think you do

522
00:31:46,688 --> 00:31:52,832
Right Ronnie still keeps like you're saying like Trump's got to get the military to do it should be against

523
00:31:56,416 --> 00:32:00,256
Preparing to evacuate is one thing and that's pretty extreme

524
00:32:00,512 --> 00:32:04,608
This next clip really f***** me up a little bit he's he's he's

525
00:32:04,864 --> 00:32:05,376
Really weird

526
00:32:09,472 --> 00:32:10,240
Club Aesthetics

527
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:13,568
Vince each other

528
00:32:14,336 --> 00:32:15,104
You're doing is normal

529
00:32:19,456 --> 00:32:20,480
They're all going to be destroyed

530
00:32:26,368 --> 00:32:28,160
Power outages starvation Mass

531
00:32:28,928 --> 00:32:30,464
Nuclear war is on the table

532
00:32:32,512 --> 00:32:35,072
Sending the military into the states is on the table

533
00:32:35,584 --> 00:32:36,096
Pretty mentally tough

534
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,144
Literally

535
00:32:41,472 --> 00:32:42,752
Praying with images

536
00:32:45,056 --> 00:32:47,104
Bye-bye.

537
00:32:48,384 --> 00:32:51,968
Talking on her back to say goodbye to your kids

538
00:32:52,224 --> 00:32:54,528
Are you doing man

539
00:32:54,784 --> 00:32:56,320
At around 3 a.m.

540
00:32:59,392 --> 00:33:04,512
Goodbye when you wake up

541
00:33:05,792 --> 00:33:11,936
This is either really childish you're presenting a dumb face to your audience of severity

542
00:33:12,192 --> 00:33:16,544
You're f****** these kids up and you got to stop that stuff

543
00:33:17,568 --> 00:33:19,872
Shut the fuk up

544
00:33:25,248 --> 00:33:28,320
I don't know about that I love the first

545
00:33:32,672 --> 00:33:33,184
Jordan

546
00:33:33,696 --> 00:33:39,584
Did you say that

547
00:33:44,192 --> 00:33:46,496
Alex Alex has a point when he's right he's right

548
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:53,152
Okay we can't do this

549
00:33:53,408 --> 00:33:55,456
This is this is this is

550
00:33:57,248 --> 00:33:57,760
Literally

551
00:33:58,272 --> 00:34:00,832
Preparing to evacuate from the show

552
00:34:01,344 --> 00:34:03,904
What are you

553
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:08,000
I'm not trying to set you up so don't worry

554
00:34:09,024 --> 00:34:15,168
I do I just like the idea they close without getting to a room together convince each other what they're doing

555
00:34:15,424 --> 00:34:18,496
A good man

556
00:34:18,752 --> 00:34:21,824
Should we start a nuclear war I think that might be a bad thing

557
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:28,224
No dairy dairy it is a good thing

558
00:34:31,552 --> 00:34:37,184
So Alex gets talking about the bunker go

559
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:40,256
Touch and Go

560
00:34:40,768 --> 00:34:41,280
Rajput

561
00:34:44,096 --> 00:34:44,608
At protest

562
00:34:52,288 --> 00:34:53,056
Trump Doral

563
00:34:58,688 --> 00:34:59,200
Call

564
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:01,760
Weak tools chart

565
00:35:09,184 --> 00:35:09,952
People

566
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:10,976
In Washington State

567
00:35:11,232 --> 00:35:11,744
Delirious

568
00:35:12,256 --> 00:35:12,768
Police

569
00:35:13,024 --> 00:35:14,048
Kneeling the black

570
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:17,632
Sure

571
00:35:18,912 --> 00:35:21,984
That's amazing

572
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:28,384
For too long the governor

573
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:34,784
States rights don't talk about that at all

574
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,576
Groupon call in

575
00:35:36,832 --> 00:35:37,600
And abused

576
00:35:37,856 --> 00:35:44,000
Constitutional

577
00:35:47,072 --> 00:35:51,168
Yeah well I mean honestly what happened next

578
00:35:51,424 --> 00:35:57,568
I'm a little mad photo-ops like for different reasons

579
00:35:57,824 --> 00:36:03,968
Hypocrisy of the later

580
00:36:04,224 --> 00:36:04,736
People

581
00:36:04,992 --> 00:36:08,832
Alex it's you just as racist

582
00:36:10,112 --> 00:36:11,904
Complicated feelings

583
00:36:12,672 --> 00:36:18,304
There's a top story on Infowars here on Monday and no

584
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:19,072
I don't think it's good

585
00:36:20,096 --> 00:36:20,608
Story

586
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:22,144
On the site

587
00:36:23,168 --> 00:36:24,192
Pull that up

588
00:36:31,872 --> 00:36:32,384
Video

589
00:36:33,664 --> 00:36:34,688
George Floyd

590
00:36:39,808 --> 00:36:40,320
Bombshell

591
00:36:40,576 --> 00:36:41,088
Reveal

592
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:42,112
Corroborate

593
00:36:42,368 --> 00:36:43,136
Support

594
00:36:43,392 --> 00:36:43,904
Floyd

595
00:36:45,184 --> 00:36:45,696
Heart attack

596
00:36:51,328 --> 00:36:51,840
It's cost him.

597
00:36:52,608 --> 00:36:53,376
Criswell who cares

598
00:36:53,632 --> 00:36:55,936
About the last part

599
00:36:56,192 --> 00:36:57,472
I don't care about anyone

600
00:36:57,728 --> 00:37:01,568
Watch the video on Infowars

601
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:02,592
It looks like

602
00:37:02,848 --> 00:37:08,480
Possible

603
00:37:08,736 --> 00:37:14,112
Like I said it doesn't matter

604
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:21,024
Even if he had a small amount of cocaine on it I accept no argument that is essentially

605
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:27,424
It's not fine to kill it for the police to kill somebody but it's more fine for them to kill me this person because they

606
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:32,032
No it's not any friends

607
00:37:32,288 --> 00:37:38,432
You could have easily been caught with some cocaine all them and I don't think the police are justified in killing

608
00:37:38,688 --> 00:37:39,712
Everybody the same way

609
00:37:39,968 --> 00:37:40,480
You would think

610
00:37:40,736 --> 00:37:43,040
Alex is trying to use this to argue

611
00:37:43,296 --> 00:37:45,856
Killed by the officer but he had a heart attack from being on cocaine

612
00:37:46,112 --> 00:37:50,208
But even if he had cocaine in his hands that doesn't mean he was on it or is it a system

613
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,048
Conclusions the dog

614
00:37:54,304 --> 00:37:55,072
Match

615
00:37:55,584 --> 00:37:59,168
Further neither of the preliminary autopsy should have come out of

616
00:37:59,424 --> 00:38:01,984
That he had drugs in his system

617
00:38:02,496 --> 00:38:05,568
Later there will be one that says that he had traces of sense

618
00:38:06,336 --> 00:38:10,688
System is true later but at this point

619
00:38:10,944 --> 00:38:12,992
The two preliminary autopsy

620
00:38:13,248 --> 00:38:14,016
Come out at night

621
00:38:14,272 --> 00:38:15,808
Specify.

622
00:38:16,064 --> 00:38:22,208
Sure sure drop this cocaine he was already

623
00:38:22,464 --> 00:38:22,976
Basically under

624
00:38:23,232 --> 00:38:23,744
Police custody

625
00:38:24,512 --> 00:38:25,024
They will go on

626
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:30,400
A killer and

627
00:38:30,912 --> 00:38:35,520
I definitely zero doubt that if George Floyd drops cocaine that it would have been found

628
00:38:35,776 --> 00:38:41,920
It would have been a part of the police report looking to find any sort of extenuating circumstances that could justify the police's action

629
00:38:42,944 --> 00:38:44,736
It's really inappropriate for Alex jump

630
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:48,064
To conclusions just based on something one of his insurance on a video

631
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:49,600
Cuz here's the reality

632
00:38:50,624 --> 00:38:54,208
He was wearing a sleeveless shirt at no point does it go into his pockets

633
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:56,768
If you read the police report it makes no sense

634
00:38:57,024 --> 00:38:59,072
He could have been in his hand the whole time

635
00:38:59,328 --> 00:39:00,096
From the report

636
00:39:00,352 --> 00:39:02,144
As officer Lane began

637
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:07,008
Speaking with mr. Floyd got out and pointed it at Mr Floyd

638
00:39:07,264 --> 00:39:08,544
Floyd to show his hands

639
00:39:09,056 --> 00:39:13,920
It seems like in the process of showing his hand this would have been revealed that doesn't seem likely

640
00:39:14,432 --> 00:39:19,296
Here's what I think the video shows and I should tell you I can't prove this but it's a possible explanation

641
00:39:20,064 --> 00:39:24,160
Supposed to drop out of Floyd's

642
00:39:24,416 --> 00:39:28,256
He's Back Against The Wall by police and slid down into a sitting position

643
00:39:28,768 --> 00:39:31,328
He's coming down this wall hands behind his back

644
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:35,424
You can clearly see that this wall that is sliding down is painted white

645
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:38,240
With some of the paint missing from the side panel

646
00:39:38,496 --> 00:39:40,288
Clearly visible in the video shot

647
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:46,944
I think it's entirely possible that would be enslaved into a sitting position his arms and back scraped against the wall

648
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:49,760
Power is really just a paint chip

649
00:39:50,272 --> 00:39:52,320
I don't know that but it's impossible

650
00:39:52,576 --> 00:39:56,928
Explanation for what's a phenomenon

651
00:39:57,696 --> 00:39:58,976
And your eyes I just don't

652
00:39:59,232 --> 00:40:02,560
Right it shows them beating him into a cop car and then murder

653
00:40:03,328 --> 00:40:06,144
I don't I don't know what the situation is with his little white

654
00:40:08,192 --> 00:40:09,472
My Explorations possible

655
00:40:10,496 --> 00:40:15,616
What I can say with certainty is that Alex cannot prove that this is a bag of white powder yet he's reporting it as Defender

656
00:40:16,128 --> 00:40:18,176
He's a reporting at that like this

657
00:40:18,432 --> 00:40:23,040
Steube a bag of white powder

658
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:25,344
He clearly drops a bag of white powder

659
00:40:25,856 --> 00:40:26,624
This is not

660
00:40:27,136 --> 00:40:29,440
Like this isn't something that they can report

661
00:40:29,952 --> 00:40:32,000
This is a guest but they're making

662
00:40:32,768 --> 00:40:33,792
Well it should be

663
00:40:34,304 --> 00:40:39,680
I can't because he's desperate

664
00:40:39,936 --> 00:40:40,704
To tarnish the victim

665
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:42,496
Police violence

666
00:40:43,008 --> 00:40:44,288
Works for his narrative

667
00:40:45,056 --> 00:40:48,384
What's discusses more stuff about George Floyd

668
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:49,408
He's doing this

669
00:40:49,664 --> 00:40:50,432
With the

670
00:40:50,688 --> 00:40:53,760
Hyper intention trying to smear

671
00:40:54,528 --> 00:40:55,552
Does George Floyd

672
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:04,512
Research

673
00:41:08,864 --> 00:41:11,424
I wonder what kind of research Alex date about George Floyd

674
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:15,008
I'm curious how you missed the article in Christianity Today titled

675
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:17,824
George Floyd left the gospel Legacy in Houston

676
00:41:18,592 --> 00:41:24,224
Just a small walk through been involved in Ministry

677
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:27,808
To Minneapolis for a job interview through a Christian work program

678
00:41:28,576 --> 00:41:30,880
The church in Houston

679
00:41:31,392 --> 00:41:33,952
The things that he would say to young man always reference

680
00:41:34,208 --> 00:41:36,256
The god Trump speech Street culture

681
00:41:36,768 --> 00:41:40,864
I think he wanted to see young men put guns down and have Jesus instead of the streets

682
00:41:41,632 --> 00:41:43,168
Another fellow churchgoers

683
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:45,728
His faith was a heart for the Third Ward

684
00:41:45,984 --> 00:41:48,544
That was radically changed by the gospel

685
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:52,128
And his mission was empowering other believers to be able to come in

686
00:41:52,384 --> 00:41:52,895
I push that cost

687
00:41:53,151 --> 00:41:53,663
Before

688
00:41:54,175 --> 00:41:58,015
I would assume that I was just read various tweets from racist undecided that counts as research

689
00:41:58,527 --> 00:42:04,671
He's invested in telling the story one particular way and it's important to recognize that and recognize why

690
00:42:04,927 --> 00:42:05,439
It's just

691
00:42:05,695 --> 00:42:06,463
It's just he's black

692
00:42:06,975 --> 00:42:12,607
Obviously

693
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:13,631
Maybe more something

694
00:42:14,143 --> 00:42:15,167
But it's just he is black

695
00:42:15,423 --> 00:42:18,751
Might be more analysis if we hadn't done this a lot already

696
00:42:19,007 --> 00:42:24,383
Yeah well that's a guy

697
00:42:25,151 --> 00:42:28,223
So Alex pretends it's like a man

698
00:42:28,479 --> 00:42:29,759
I knew this was all coming

699
00:42:30,015 --> 00:42:30,527
I knew it

700
00:42:40,511 --> 00:42:41,535
Cavanal me to house

701
00:42:43,071 --> 00:42:45,887
A totalitarian regime oh sorry

702
00:42:48,703 --> 00:42:49,215
Play jazz

703
00:42:50,751 --> 00:42:51,775
You can't prove any of that

704
00:42:52,031 --> 00:42:58,175
So I can't get on rest might be coming and images of race Wars

705
00:42:58,431 --> 00:43:02,271
Pretty regularly

706
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:08,671
Tons and tons of predictions which is an intentional strategy

707
00:43:08,927 --> 00:43:10,207
Be right about one of them

708
00:43:10,975 --> 00:43:16,607
I can't count the number of times he said that the he knows the globalists are going to try to kill Trump within the next week or two

709
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:23,007
These predictions have never come true but his audience is trained to ignore those failed predictions and only focus on fake stuff

710
00:43:23,263 --> 00:43:24,543
You can pretend he was accurate about

711
00:43:25,567 --> 00:43:31,711
In the midst of the coronavirus death Alex did talk about social unrest concerns related to the

712
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:38,879
It didn't come in the form of protest against the stomach police violence and Glisan. Responsiveness to violence against non-white person

713
00:43:39,903 --> 00:43:45,791
How to start up in the lockdown was going to crush the economy and then everyone to be starving and that would cause upheaval

714
00:43:46,047 --> 00:43:48,351
As he discussed when he ranted by eating his neighbors

715
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:52,191
That prediction was literally nothing like we're seeing happening right now

716
00:43:52,447 --> 00:43:56,031
So even if he can massage things for his audience to make it look prosthetic

717
00:43:56,287 --> 00:43:57,055
You you was not

718
00:43:57,823 --> 00:44:01,407
Maybe like if they interviewed Charles Manson and he was like see I was right

719
00:44:01,663 --> 00:44:02,687
Like fuk off

720
00:44:02,943 --> 00:44:03,967
It's not a thing

721
00:44:04,223 --> 00:44:08,063
You said there would be erased but that's not

722
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:09,343
Get night also this isn't

723
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:10,623
Exactly

724
00:44:11,903 --> 00:44:14,207
Should be repeated over and over again

725
00:44:14,463 --> 00:44:14,975
Glassware

726
00:44:15,487 --> 00:44:20,095
So Alex has big overarching prediction like what are you talking about like what comes after

727
00:44:20,351 --> 00:44:22,911
Things coronavirus coverage days

728
00:44:23,167 --> 00:44:25,215
Was that the whole coronavirus thing with

729
00:44:25,471 --> 00:44:25,983
The test run

730
00:44:26,239 --> 00:44:31,615
And it was leading tomato ravech scenes and also another biological weapon release though kill billions of people

731
00:44:32,127 --> 00:44:37,759
That was the primary focus of his narrative and before that

732
00:44:38,015 --> 00:44:40,319
In Chicago over and over again

733
00:44:40,575 --> 00:44:41,855
Are you sure

734
00:44:42,623 --> 00:44:48,767
Because Alex Rambles about bulshit pretty much everyday and so much of it

735
00:44:49,023 --> 00:44:53,119
Last few months of yelling about race Wars or some s***

736
00:44:53,375 --> 00:44:54,143
All I was saying was

737
00:44:54,399 --> 00:44:55,423
My prediction

738
00:44:55,935 --> 00:44:59,263
It's not his prediction was about a medical tyranny run by Bill Gates

739
00:44:59,775 --> 00:45:05,407
Because the circumstances of the world Reckoning is predictions of the Beast being focused on all this as being what

740
00:45:05,663 --> 00:45:06,175
Comes next app

741
00:45:06,431 --> 00:45:06,943
Double-check

742
00:45:07,199 --> 00:45:08,991
Space

743
00:45:09,503 --> 00:45:10,527
It's like writing a package

744
00:45:11,295 --> 00:45:12,575
A late night show you got to have

745
00:45:12,831 --> 00:45:13,599
25

746
00:45:13,855 --> 00:45:19,999
Different predictions to make put them all out on the same episode that way you can cut it to whatever one of them maybe

747
00:45:20,511 --> 00:45:21,023
Ensure

748
00:45:21,535 --> 00:45:23,583
Alex

749
00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:25,119
Savannah Hernandez

750
00:45:25,375 --> 00:45:30,239
Here's a Incognito reporter and a person

751
00:45:30,495 --> 00:45:31,007
Zach

752
00:45:31,263 --> 00:45:31,775
On

753
00:45:32,031 --> 00:45:34,079
They come on to talk about the mattress burnout

754
00:45:34,335 --> 00:45:37,151
They talked about it for a long time

755
00:45:37,407 --> 00:45:39,199
I hide the fact they are naked propaganda

756
00:45:42,015 --> 00:45:45,087
Did they come out to talk about that and I'll say like if they did do it

757
00:45:45,855 --> 00:45:46,623
Brass balls

758
00:45:47,135 --> 00:45:48,671
Brass balls trip

759
00:45:48,927 --> 00:45:52,767
A strip

760
00:45:53,279 --> 00:45:57,119
Bear arms.

761
00:45:57,375 --> 00:45:59,935
I think is really troubling

762
00:46:00,703 --> 00:46:04,543
If you do not resist you're not going to get killed

763
00:46:05,055 --> 00:46:05,567
And that's a fact

764
00:46:10,687 --> 00:46:12,991
What's the organized what's boom

765
00:46:16,831 --> 00:46:18,367
Corruption

766
00:46:18,623 --> 00:46:19,135
Yeah

767
00:46:19,391 --> 00:46:21,183
This was even horse somebody called on him

768
00:46:22,463 --> 00:46:23,487
Control

769
00:46:27,839 --> 00:46:28,863
They put their niani

770
00:46:29,887 --> 00:46:32,447
A combination of drugs and that killed him and now we got right

771
00:46:33,727 --> 00:46:35,263
I don't know how it's

772
00:46:35,775 --> 00:46:38,335
Makes sense for someone Infowars

773
00:46:39,103 --> 00:46:39,871
Hard

774
00:46:40,127 --> 00:46:43,199
Libertarian-leaning supposedly

775
00:46:43,455 --> 00:46:44,991
Ron Paul Style

776
00:46:45,247 --> 00:46:46,783
Conservative Outlet

777
00:46:50,623 --> 00:46:53,951
Mister police state is allowing one of his reports and sing

778
00:46:54,207 --> 00:46:57,535
Yeah absolutely after she says if you don't resist arrest

779
00:46:57,791 --> 00:47:00,351
If you just submit to the authorities are not going to get killed

780
00:47:00,607 --> 00:47:03,935
Yeah that's the libertarian position submit to Authority

781
00:47:04,447 --> 00:47:04,959
I don't I don't

782
00:47:05,215 --> 00:47:11,359
That's why Bill Cooper died because he was submitting to authority too much

783
00:47:11,615 --> 00:47:14,431
This is a pretty standard refrain from braces

784
00:47:14,687 --> 00:47:19,295
If they would just resist not resist the place

785
00:47:19,807 --> 00:47:24,415
It's a standard justify the brand of State back violence they support

786
00:47:24,671 --> 00:47:28,511
Well keeping in touch their complaints about the imaginary State Violence lyrics

787
00:47:29,023 --> 00:47:30,303
Fears about gun regulations

788
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:31,071
Jet

789
00:47:32,607 --> 00:47:37,215
What are the other cases it comes up very often in relation to current protest is the killing of breonna Taylor

790
00:47:37,983 --> 00:47:41,567
Taylor was killed in her home after police executed a no-knock search warrant

791
00:47:41,823 --> 00:47:45,151
Because they thought the suspected drug dealer kept drugs and money in that home

792
00:47:45,663 --> 00:47:49,503
Do did not live there and he'd already been arrested

793
00:47:49,759 --> 00:47:53,087
Some reason felt it important to do a no-knock which is really dangerous

794
00:47:53,855 --> 00:47:59,999
It was about 12:40 at night so Brianna's boyfriend Kenneth Walker thought they were home Invaders

795
00:48:00,255 --> 00:48:01,279
John and fired one shot

796
00:48:01,791 --> 00:48:07,935
Please return to Taylor and sending bullets into the next child

797
00:48:08,703 --> 00:48:13,311
Kenneth Walker beagley on his firearm and

798
00:48:13,567 --> 00:48:14,591
Galaxy

799
00:48:14,847 --> 00:48:18,431
Firmly believe he has every right to protect himself in those circumstances

800
00:48:18,943 --> 00:48:20,479
So what about that Savannah

801
00:48:20,735 --> 00:48:22,783
How did breonna Taylor acted like to her death

802
00:48:23,551 --> 00:48:28,159
If you don't resist arrest

803
00:48:28,415 --> 00:48:30,975
They're far too many cases that service counterexample

804
00:48:31,231 --> 00:48:33,791
Put on Savannah's doing here is joining the Infowars game

805
00:48:34,047 --> 00:48:36,607
I'm trying to make non-white peoples murders their own fault

806
00:48:37,375 --> 00:48:40,191
Just b*******

807
00:48:40,447 --> 00:48:44,287
Our groceries

808
00:48:44,799 --> 00:48:46,079
I don't support what they did

809
00:48:46,335 --> 00:48:47,103
I don't think that it's

810
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:49,919
Too right I don't think

811
00:48:50,175 --> 00:48:52,991
Well if he wasn't resisting arrest he wouldn't

812
00:48:53,759 --> 00:48:59,391
It's his fault he's not even doing the right thing by doing what they're doing he was resisting arrest

813
00:48:59,647 --> 00:49:01,183
She knows

814
00:49:01,439 --> 00:49:02,207
He's not as good at

815
00:49:02,463 --> 00:49:07,071
No she's I should say that for the cops

816
00:49:07,327 --> 00:49:08,863
If they're at all resisting

817
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:10,143
I think I

818
00:49:10,399 --> 00:49:12,191
I think it'll take probably a

819
00:49:12,447 --> 00:49:13,727
Fairly specific

820
00:49:13,983 --> 00:49:20,127
Type of person to start working at Infowars late in the game

821
00:49:20,383 --> 00:49:21,919
Maybe have been there for like 50

822
00:49:22,175 --> 00:49:23,455
18 years or so

823
00:49:23,711 --> 00:49:24,479
And maybe they

824
00:49:24,991 --> 00:49:29,087
Boiled while they were in it near the lobsters who didn't

825
00:49:29,343 --> 00:49:31,135
Realized

826
00:49:31,391 --> 00:49:35,743
Like to be gravitating towards a particularly after 2015

827
00:49:35,999 --> 00:49:38,303
Is weird and I think you have to be

828
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:40,863
Pretty angry pretty violent

829
00:49:41,887 --> 00:49:42,911
I just don't

830
00:49:43,423 --> 00:49:44,191
I can't imagine

831
00:49:44,703 --> 00:49:45,727
Anybody thinking

832
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:47,263
There are legitimate

833
00:49:47,519 --> 00:49:48,543
Or credible Outlet

834
00:49:48,799 --> 00:49:50,847
Or that there anything other than

835
00:49:51,103 --> 00:49:53,407
It like a means to express

836
00:49:53,663 --> 00:49:59,295
Hey

837
00:49:59,551 --> 00:50:00,575
Says a lot about you

838
00:50:01,343 --> 00:50:06,463
So after this Alex has Owen Shroyer and a guy who owned the gun shop on and I just

839
00:50:06,719 --> 00:50:07,743
Turn it off

840
00:50:08,255 --> 00:50:09,791
I don't care

841
00:50:10,303 --> 00:50:13,119
So we do. Here on the 2nd on Tuesday

842
00:50:13,887 --> 00:50:17,215
And a little bit of an update on this your bricks story

843
00:50:17,471 --> 00:50:20,031
About Soros in the fork

844
00:50:20,799 --> 00:50:25,663
Ladies and gentlemen we've now discovered who is delivering bricks to more than 20 cities is

845
00:50:32,319 --> 00:50:38,463
Wow yes you can if I had to guess what's going on here some dum-dum online company to link to

846
00:50:38,719 --> 00:50:43,583
Do traditional globalist behind existence of bricks at protest

847
00:50:44,351 --> 00:50:45,119
Actually that is what time

848
00:50:45,887 --> 00:50:51,007
Acme Brick Factory before 1900 name of the world

849
00:50:51,263 --> 00:50:52,543
As well as, codes

850
00:50:53,055 --> 00:50:56,383
True

851
00:50:56,639 --> 00:50:58,431
Corporation

852
00:50:58,687 --> 00:50:59,967
Steve Justin companies

853
00:51:00,223 --> 00:51:00,991
From Fort Worth Texas

854
00:51:01,247 --> 00:51:03,039
And Louisiana concrete products

855
00:51:03,807 --> 00:51:07,903
In 1972 they formally changed their name to Justin Industries Incorporated

856
00:51:08,415 --> 00:51:09,951
Underneath this umbrella they're a bunch of

857
00:51:10,207 --> 00:51:14,303
Subsidiary businesses including Acme Brick as well as Featherlite Building Products

858
00:51:14,815 --> 00:51:15,327
And Justin Boots

859
00:51:16,607 --> 00:51:21,727
Amir 2000 Berkshire Hathaway acquired Justin Industries which includes all those subsidiary business

860
00:51:22,751 --> 00:51:27,871
Alexander be f****** up the whole thing cuz Bill Gates and the guy you talked about with Berkshire Hathaway

861
00:51:28,127 --> 00:51:30,687
It's me ice cream lover himself Warren Bobby

862
00:51:31,455 --> 00:51:33,503
Bill Gates is on the board of Berkshire Hathaway

863
00:51:33,759 --> 00:51:36,063
Premier League charitable initiative

864
00:51:36,319 --> 00:51:38,623
Rarely has any stock compared to Buffy

865
00:51:39,903 --> 00:51:41,951
Is the guy who you point fingers at with Berkshire Hathaway

866
00:51:42,207 --> 00:51:48,351
Been the laziest time for Alex to make Bill Gates connect to your social unrest narratives missing Bill Gates

867
00:51:48,607 --> 00:51:51,423
Is on the board as the head of subterfuge

868
00:51:51,679 --> 00:51:54,239
Mistresses going to play Manny just got to stick with Soros

869
00:51:54,495 --> 00:51:55,775
I don't know what he's trying to do

870
00:51:56,287 --> 00:52:01,663
Alex is taking this from a videos on Twitter supposed to be

871
00:52:02,175 --> 00:52:08,319
It's just her talking to her camera and sing dropping off brakes

872
00:52:08,575 --> 00:52:13,695
Bill Gates it's very clear that this is a source

873
00:52:13,951 --> 00:52:15,487
200000

874
00:52:15,743 --> 00:52:18,559
And almost one eleven thousand retweet

875
00:52:18,815 --> 00:52:21,119
Jesus it was making the rounds

876
00:52:21,375 --> 00:52:27,519
There's nothing I believe more than a random woman standing in front of brick saying that it's Berkshire Hathaway

877
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:36,223
Okay great elise's bio reads quotes researcher and Truth

878
00:52:36,479 --> 00:52:42,623
Great about your videos hashtag

879
00:52:42,879 --> 00:52:49,023
Hashtag

880
00:52:49,279 --> 00:52:50,815
In the past week she's posted

881
00:52:51,071 --> 00:52:56,703
Clearly fake Craigslist post that are by recruiting crisis actors tons of stuff about plandemic

882
00:52:56,959 --> 00:52:59,519
One particularly

883
00:52:59,775 --> 00:53:00,799
Mel Gibson quotes

884
00:53:01,055 --> 00:53:04,127
Try to expose the scum in 2017

885
00:53:04,383 --> 00:53:05,919
Sure

886
00:53:06,175 --> 00:53:12,319
She's commenting on there is about how Gibson said the quote parasites of kids

887
00:53:12,831 --> 00:53:14,879
Which of the whole lot like a blood libel kind of thing

888
00:53:17,439 --> 00:53:21,791
His dad's a holocaust and Ira in 2006 when he got arrested for drunk driving

889
00:53:22,047 --> 00:53:26,399
This was part of the police report or what are you going to do

890
00:53:26,655 --> 00:53:32,799
Gibson almost continually threatened the Malibu and will spend all his money to get even with

891
00:53:33,055 --> 00:53:39,199
Gibson blurted out a barrage of anti-semitic remarks about Jews

892
00:53:39,711 --> 00:53:43,295
Gibson gelder quote the Jews are responsible for all the wars in the world

893
00:53:43,551 --> 00:53:44,319
The Gibson that ass

894
00:53:48,415 --> 00:53:54,559
He's saying stuff school stuff about these group of people involved children

895
00:53:54,815 --> 00:53:55,839
But I believe you

896
00:53:56,351 --> 00:54:00,959
If you might want to question what kind of information you're passing a law

897
00:54:01,215 --> 00:54:01,983
Maybe that's something

898
00:54:05,055 --> 00:54:08,639
So idiot qanon weirdo

899
00:54:08,895 --> 00:54:10,175
Asserting something without proof

900
00:54:10,431 --> 00:54:12,479
Donaire

901
00:54:12,735 --> 00:54:16,831
I feel like Berkshire Hathaway in Acme Brick could have grounds for a legal suit

902
00:54:17,087 --> 00:54:17,599
Alex

903
00:54:17,855 --> 00:54:22,975
He's claiming they're involved in a plan to cause this property damage and that's definitely meant to defame them and hurt their business

904
00:54:23,231 --> 00:54:25,279
I think they should.

905
00:54:25,535 --> 00:54:30,911
F****** sue them for all the ice cream in the world

906
00:54:31,167 --> 00:54:35,263
It's totally naturally-occurring the sign here's the thing

907
00:54:35,519 --> 00:54:38,591
Connect this kind of like with Sandy

908
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:44,991
Is that when questioned about why he reported things as fact and proven

909
00:54:45,503 --> 00:54:47,039
He's in those depositions

910
00:54:47,295 --> 00:54:48,063
He points to this

911
00:54:48,319 --> 00:54:54,463
Bulshit that he found if you was asked to prove this Acme Brick

912
00:54:54,719 --> 00:54:57,023
All he could do is point of this qanon weirdos video

913
00:54:57,279 --> 00:55:03,423
And then be like that you're taking this from that's the level of work you do for work

914
00:55:03,679 --> 00:55:08,287
So that would be the benefit of suing

915
00:55:08,543 --> 00:55:12,895
You know it's not liable if somebody else says it and then I reported as fact

916
00:55:13,151 --> 00:55:14,175
That's not how it works

917
00:55:16,735 --> 00:55:22,623
I'm not I'm not sitting here particularly concerned about Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway's reputation

918
00:55:22,879 --> 00:55:27,231
Really forcing Alex to admit like I just took a f****** qanon Twitter video

919
00:55:27,487 --> 00:55:29,023
I reported it as fax

920
00:55:29,535 --> 00:55:30,303
Somebody just do it

921
00:55:30,559 --> 00:55:32,607
Nope the benefit

922
00:55:32,863 --> 00:55:39,007
Do it so also there was a new video that was going around which is reporting to police with a truck full of bricks

923
00:55:39,263 --> 00:55:44,127
Leaving the break somewhere strategically in order for protesters

924
00:55:44,383 --> 00:55:45,663
And to justify a violent

925
00:55:46,175 --> 00:55:46,687
Response

926
00:55:46,943 --> 00:55:49,503
Presumably they're working for Soros if you're on the right

927
00:55:49,759 --> 00:55:51,551
Or they're just cops if you're not

928
00:55:52,319 --> 00:55:54,623
I'm not going to say that it's impossible that there are some in

929
00:55:54,879 --> 00:55:56,927
Census of police trying to facilitate situation

930
00:55:57,183 --> 00:55:59,743
Where they could get people to respond violently

931
00:55:59,999 --> 00:56:02,815
Rationalized

932
00:56:03,071 --> 00:56:09,215
Autotrader's bfbi everybody Department of Homeland Security I'm not saying

933
00:56:09,471 --> 00:56:10,495
Doesn't happen

934
00:56:10,751 --> 00:56:13,311
This video doesn't prove anything and honestly it's

935
00:56:13,567 --> 00:56:16,895
Pretty sad seeing you get passed around by people I've seen between it

936
00:56:17,407 --> 00:56:20,735
Alexander Parker

937
00:56:20,991 --> 00:56:22,527
Followed by three stars

938
00:56:22,783 --> 00:56:28,927
Which is a dead giveaway this is further established by them

939
00:56:29,183 --> 00:56:30,207
Play The Medic in between

940
00:56:30,463 --> 00:56:31,743
Who's a huge qanon booster

941
00:56:32,511 --> 00:56:35,327
Also tagged in the Tweet is an account called

942
00:56:35,583 --> 00:56:38,143
Punished damn 1776

943
00:56:38,399 --> 00:56:39,423
Which speaks for itself

944
00:56:39,935 --> 00:56:45,311
Also they're biohaz where we go one we go all in it

945
00:56:45,567 --> 00:56:48,639
Alexander Parker his Retreat Jack Pacific multiple times

946
00:56:48,895 --> 00:56:55,039
And also a cute walking out of the White House with a sword in his hand and angel wings drawing

947
00:56:55,551 --> 00:56:56,319
We're all doing

948
00:56:56,831 --> 00:56:58,111
Great video doesn't show anything

949
00:56:58,367 --> 00:57:04,511
Inconclusive being spread by qanon accounts it might be wise to pump the brakes on

950
00:57:04,767 --> 00:57:06,047
Confirming the store you want to be

951
00:57:06,303 --> 00:57:07,839
QuikTrip

952
00:57:08,095 --> 00:57:10,911
HD stops in Boston War planting bricks

953
00:57:11,167 --> 00:57:12,191
I have no idea

954
00:57:12,447 --> 00:57:13,983
Fuel does not show that

955
00:57:14,495 --> 00:57:20,639
There plenty of other explanations were could be going on

956
00:57:20,895 --> 00:57:21,663
Losing strategy

957
00:57:21,919 --> 00:57:24,991
Yeah there's just so much frustration and fury and

958
00:57:25,247 --> 00:57:26,527
And confusion and

959
00:57:26,783 --> 00:57:28,831
Nobody knows what the hell is going on

960
00:57:29,087 --> 00:57:30,623
Understand why you can

961
00:57:31,135 --> 00:57:32,159
Like get caught up in

962
00:57:32,671 --> 00:57:37,023
Like I said it's very easy we saw it happen over and over and over again we saw Alex

963
00:57:37,279 --> 00:57:40,351
Immediately after the Boston bombings did what we did

964
00:57:40,607 --> 00:57:41,119
No

965
00:57:41,375 --> 00:57:43,679
Show me people shared pictures of other people

966
00:57:43,935 --> 00:57:49,311
Spaces just said hey these are the guys so many times

967
00:57:49,567 --> 00:57:51,359
It's just

968
00:57:51,871 --> 00:57:54,687
It's just so hard I understand because

969
00:57:54,943 --> 00:57:55,455
Restraint

970
00:57:55,711 --> 00:57:56,479
Now

971
00:57:56,735 --> 00:57:58,271
Seems f****** insane

972
00:57:58,527 --> 00:58:00,063
Write the idea of like

973
00:58:00,319 --> 00:58:04,415
Hold off until we figure this out I understand that

974
00:58:04,927 --> 00:58:05,439
Directed

975
00:58:05,695 --> 00:58:07,231
Twitter

976
00:58:07,487 --> 00:58:08,255
I never be great

977
00:58:09,023 --> 00:58:10,559
Yeah

978
00:58:10,815 --> 00:58:11,839
My hypocritical dumb

979
00:58:12,351 --> 00:58:15,167
I just think that like there is

980
00:58:15,935 --> 00:58:17,727
There's something about the immediacy of

981
00:58:17,983 --> 00:58:20,543
Social media that allows everyone to be really suck

982
00:58:20,799 --> 00:58:21,567
Sloppy with it

983
00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:23,103
I am II

984
00:58:23,359 --> 00:58:23,871
I just

985
00:58:24,383 --> 00:58:26,687
I would ask people be a little bit more

986
00:58:27,199 --> 00:58:29,247
Conscious be more careful like

987
00:58:29,503 --> 00:58:31,295
If you're if you're putting a

988
00:58:31,551 --> 00:58:32,319
A video

989
00:58:32,575 --> 00:58:33,855
It has the caption

990
00:58:34,623 --> 00:58:36,671
Police in Boston caught

991
00:58:37,183 --> 00:58:38,719
Believing bricks as asset

992
00:58:39,743 --> 00:58:42,047
Watch the video and if it doesn't show that

993
00:58:42,559 --> 00:58:43,839
Don't pass it along

994
00:58:45,119 --> 00:58:45,887
Like I don't I can't

995
00:58:46,399 --> 00:58:47,935
Understand

996
00:58:48,191 --> 00:58:51,007
I know I grew up on social media

997
00:58:51,263 --> 00:58:53,823
I understand how social media

998
00:58:54,591 --> 00:58:55,871
I don't understand how people can

999
00:58:56,895 --> 00:59:00,991
Well in all the terms-of-service ones that you click okay

1000
00:59:01,247 --> 00:59:05,087
It's not like any of them say you should use social media responsibly

1001
00:59:05,599 --> 00:59:08,927
Put it in those terms of service I'm sure we would all read all the way down

1002
00:59:10,207 --> 00:59:10,719
That's a good point

1003
00:59:13,279 --> 00:59:14,559
So this next clip

1004
00:59:14,815 --> 00:59:16,351
Alex talks about how

1005
00:59:16,863 --> 00:59:20,447
He's only going out arms now he's always got to go and

1006
00:59:20,703 --> 00:59:21,215
And then

1007
00:59:21,983 --> 00:59:24,287
I just I found this Eddie doesn't want to ask her later

1008
00:59:25,055 --> 00:59:26,335
He's a d escalation

1009
00:59:29,919 --> 00:59:30,943
But I will tell everybody now

1010
00:59:31,455 --> 00:59:32,479
You should not be out

1011
00:59:32,735 --> 00:59:33,247
After Dark

1012
00:59:40,671 --> 00:59:41,439
Passover

1013
00:59:41,951 --> 00:59:44,255
Live that my son was going to visit my parents

1014
00:59:46,303 --> 00:59:48,351
Looters in the store attacking people

1015
00:59:50,399 --> 00:59:51,167
Kick their ass

1016
00:59:53,215 --> 00:59:53,727
Unbelievable

1017
00:59:53,983 --> 00:59:54,495
IMovie

1018
00:59:55,007 --> 01:00:01,151
Alex's using video a video of his son beating up a guy like a 7-Eleven

1019
01:00:01,407 --> 01:00:03,199
That's real yeah Jesus

1020
01:00:04,223 --> 01:00:06,271
Right yeah it's really messed up

1021
01:00:06,783 --> 01:00:08,831
I don't even know what to say about it

1022
01:00:09,855 --> 01:00:10,623
Goddamn

1023
01:00:10,879 --> 01:00:11,647
Yeah

1024
01:00:13,183 --> 01:00:15,231
Pretty bad

1025
01:00:16,255 --> 01:00:22,399
If you hate looters then you hate that guy was allegedly stealing stuff from the store

1026
01:00:22,655 --> 01:00:27,263
For this Alex's Sun happen to be in

1027
01:00:27,519 --> 01:00:31,615
Right

1028
01:00:31,871 --> 01:00:32,383
Whatever

1029
01:00:32,639 --> 01:00:36,735
Is Christ conflicted content on his show

1030
01:00:36,991 --> 01:00:39,039
It's incentivizing

1031
01:00:39,295 --> 01:00:42,623
Something very negative you definitely shouldn't be proud of it

1032
01:00:46,463 --> 01:00:46,975
Later

1033
01:00:50,047 --> 01:00:56,191
Rock shows up on the show.

1034
01:00:56,447 --> 01:00:57,983
Places you should give him an uppercut

1035
01:00:58,239 --> 01:01:03,615
Instead of those hooks and it's really sad

1036
01:01:03,871 --> 01:01:10,015
That's really f****** sad

1037
01:01:12,063 --> 01:01:12,575
Video got taken

1038
01:01:22,047 --> 01:01:28,191
Turn off we need Alex's I'm talking to a gang leader about floppy titties

1039
01:01:28,447 --> 01:01:31,007
Tip of the spear

1040
01:01:31,263 --> 01:01:36,127
So we get now to this other medical report

1041
01:01:36,383 --> 01:01:36,895
They came out

1042
01:01:37,151 --> 01:01:39,455
By this point on June 2nd

1043
01:01:39,967 --> 01:01:41,503
Here's Alex.

1044
01:01:42,271 --> 01:01:42,783
Now

1045
01:01:44,319 --> 01:01:46,367
He had enough

1046
01:01:51,487 --> 01:01:52,767
The police were scared

1047
01:01:53,535 --> 01:01:54,815
Attention and put their knee on his neck

1048
01:01:59,167 --> 01:01:59,935
Defending what's copped

1049
01:02:03,263 --> 01:02:06,591
That's literally what you just did

1050
01:02:07,103 --> 01:02:11,199
Hennepin County Medical Examiner has released

1051
01:02:11,455 --> 01:02:15,295
I had traces of Fentanyl and methamphetamine use in his system

1052
01:02:15,807 --> 01:02:21,951
This is pretty imprecise but you can see how information

1053
01:02:22,207 --> 01:02:22,975
For five people

1054
01:02:23,743 --> 01:02:29,375
Whether he was on drugs or not whether he had drugs on him or not all of it is kind of irrelevant to the larger issue

1055
01:02:29,631 --> 01:02:30,911
And that is that neither of those

1056
01:02:31,167 --> 01:02:32,447
Make his death okay

1057
01:02:32,959 --> 01:02:39,103
All of this stuff Alex is doing is an attempt to make his death okay because if he's forced to get his mad about this man Beamer

1058
01:02:39,359 --> 01:02:39,871
Murdered by the police

1059
01:02:40,127 --> 01:02:42,943
As he might be if I don't know a state require background checks

1060
01:02:43,199 --> 01:02:44,479
Private Sales of guns

1061
01:02:44,735 --> 01:02:46,271
That would have a cascading effect

1062
01:02:46,527 --> 01:02:48,575
What is a basically Fall Apart

1063
01:02:48,831 --> 01:02:50,623
Because they're all based on

1064
01:02:50,879 --> 01:02:51,391
White

1065
01:02:51,647 --> 01:02:52,671
Different yeah

1066
01:02:52,927 --> 01:02:57,279
Superiority

1067
01:02:58,047 --> 01:03:00,607
He starts to give ground

1068
01:03:00,863 --> 01:03:01,375
To that

1069
01:03:01,631 --> 01:03:03,935
It will have a domino effect

1070
01:03:05,471 --> 01:03:08,287
Insects with Alex complains you know

1071
01:03:08,543 --> 01:03:11,615
Wet certainly whenever businesses

1072
01:03:11,871 --> 01:03:12,639
Is the refrain

1073
01:03:13,407 --> 01:03:14,687
I was think of the business

1074
01:03:16,479 --> 01:03:18,783
Alex same thing that happens

1075
01:03:19,039 --> 01:03:20,063
And now Alex is saying

1076
01:03:20,319 --> 01:03:22,111
Don't you think of the police

1077
01:03:22,367 --> 01:03:23,391
There have been cops

1078
01:03:23,647 --> 01:03:24,927
More than 10 police shot

1079
01:03:25,951 --> 01:03:26,719
In the last 24 hours

1080
01:03:27,999 --> 01:03:28,511
One of their name

1081
01:03:29,023 --> 01:03:30,303
Izzamedia wonder why

1082
01:03:30,559 --> 01:03:31,071
Humanized

1083
01:03:34,911 --> 01:03:35,423
Truth

1084
01:03:37,983 --> 01:03:38,495
Tacoma.

1085
01:03:40,543 --> 01:03:41,823
Randomly shot in the head

1086
01:03:42,079 --> 01:03:43,103
They won't show him

1087
01:03:44,383 --> 01:03:45,151
Say his name

1088
01:03:45,407 --> 01:03:48,479
Because they will not humanize people that we all know George

1089
01:03:48,735 --> 01:03:49,247
Boys name

1090
01:03:49,503 --> 01:03:52,063
I think there's probably a reason why they're not releasing names

1091
01:03:55,903 --> 01:03:56,671
Folks

1092
01:03:56,927 --> 01:03:57,439
Pennywise

1093
01:03:57,695 --> 01:04:00,511
There are four cops that were shot in St Louis on Monday night

1094
01:04:01,023 --> 01:04:04,607
Three were hit in the foot or leg and Fork was shot in the arm recovery

1095
01:04:05,375 --> 01:04:10,751
As of the time of this recording I can find no information on who shot them so I have no idea who the people associated with the protest

1096
01:04:11,007 --> 01:04:11,519
Or not

1097
01:04:12,031 --> 01:04:14,847
In Las Vegas a couple shot and killed and that is not good

1098
01:04:15,359 --> 01:04:20,735
The shooter was arrested and is in custody but there's no information I can find about the perpetrator as of the time of

1099
01:04:20,991 --> 01:04:21,503
Recording

1100
01:04:21,759 --> 01:04:27,135
However that night Las Vegas Police also shot and killed someone at a protest who they said was reaching for a firearm

1101
01:04:27,391 --> 01:04:29,695
I don't know the reality that story is but that's at

1102
01:04:29,951 --> 01:04:30,975
Turn Alex's coverage

1103
01:04:31,487 --> 01:04:36,351
Also centralized episode police shot and killed BBQ restaurant owner David michetti

1104
01:04:36,607 --> 01:04:38,655
Would you like to deeply Street being fired

1105
01:04:39,423 --> 01:04:45,567
I'm not going to sit here and justify in discriminately firing guns at police but I am going to say that if you're going to cover that story

1106
01:04:45,823 --> 01:04:50,175
It's your responsibility to also point out that there's a high level of police brutality

1107
01:04:50,431 --> 01:04:51,967
It's being documented across the country

1108
01:04:52,479 --> 01:04:54,271
These are borderline cases either

1109
01:04:54,783 --> 01:04:59,903
These are instances of people marching or congregating peacefully only to have tear gas grenades

1110
01:05:00,927 --> 01:05:07,071
Sometimes fired at their faces videos of police throwing people to the ground unprovoked

1111
01:05:07,327 --> 01:05:08,863
Footage of cops driving through people

1112
01:05:09,119 --> 01:05:10,143
Yeah

1113
01:05:10,911 --> 01:05:14,751
If you're telling the story of the police being attacked and not talking about the other side

1114
01:05:15,007 --> 01:05:16,543
Explicitly trying to do PR work for the

1115
01:05:16,799 --> 01:05:18,847
Police you're just trying to hide their actions

1116
01:05:19,359 --> 01:05:21,151
Yeah but that is all that's going on

1117
01:05:21,407 --> 01:05:21,919
For free

1118
01:05:22,175 --> 01:05:26,015
For the for the Coppa of PR system

1119
01:05:26,271 --> 01:05:26,783
Yep

1120
01:05:27,039 --> 01:05:28,831
There's a

1121
01:05:29,087 --> 01:05:30,367
Grape

1122
01:05:30,623 --> 01:05:34,207
Kivik for Alex's career mister anti-police

1123
01:05:34,463 --> 01:05:38,047
Free Press work for the cops with a dick

1124
01:05:39,071 --> 01:05:41,119
The cops are all cops they're always acting

1125
01:05:41,375 --> 01:05:41,887
Can you tell defense

1126
01:05:43,935 --> 01:05:45,727
Threat

1127
01:05:45,983 --> 01:05:47,519
That seems to be Alex's position

1128
01:05:47,775 --> 01:05:50,591
That's where he's coming from if you don't

1129
01:05:51,103 --> 01:05:53,407
Resist they won't kill you

1130
01:05:53,663 --> 01:05:57,503
I just don't understand how you is like it has to be there so insulated

1131
01:05:57,759 --> 01:05:59,807
These people must be so insulated

1132
01:06:00,063 --> 01:06:01,343
From viewing any of these

1133
01:06:02,111 --> 01:06:03,391
Cuz you can't see

1134
01:06:03,647 --> 01:06:09,535
So many

1135
01:06:09,791 --> 01:06:13,375
And then have them recommend every single one of them until your glass

1136
01:06:13,631 --> 01:06:14,655
Like f****** one of us

1137
01:06:15,167 --> 01:06:21,311
It's not radical isn't it strikes me it strikes me that I think Alex doesn't do any work

1138
01:06:22,335 --> 01:06:26,431
I think that he just comes in as the curated stuff that is

1139
01:06:26,687 --> 01:06:28,479
Crew has given him any yells about it

1140
01:06:28,735 --> 01:06:33,087
That must be what goes on because otherwise like

1141
01:06:33,343 --> 01:06:34,623
He would be seeing

1142
01:06:34,879 --> 01:06:35,903
Tons and tons

1143
01:06:36,159 --> 01:06:37,183
Tons of videos

1144
01:06:37,439 --> 01:06:40,511
Police acting inappropriately

1145
01:06:40,767 --> 01:06:43,327
Basically just be sitting there must have done something

1146
01:06:43,583 --> 01:06:46,143
Yeah exactly every single one

1147
01:06:46,399 --> 01:06:47,423
Keep doing that

1148
01:06:49,215 --> 01:06:50,239
I just find

1149
01:06:50,495 --> 01:06:52,031
Pretty difficult to believe that

1150
01:06:52,287 --> 01:06:53,311
Someone

1151
01:06:54,079 --> 01:06:55,615
Who's yelled about the police and

1152
01:06:55,871 --> 01:06:56,639
Brutalities

1153
01:06:56,895 --> 01:06:57,663
For so long

1154
01:06:58,175 --> 01:06:59,199
So performatively

1155
01:06:59,711 --> 01:07:04,575
So funny so funny that this guy who made multiple documentaries about the police state

1156
01:07:05,087 --> 01:07:08,159
Be around when police were enacting curfews and

1157
01:07:08,415 --> 01:07:11,231
Sending the national guard against protesters and

1158
01:07:11,487 --> 01:07:13,023
You'll be on the side of

1159
01:07:13,279 --> 01:07:15,839
Police

1160
01:07:16,095 --> 01:07:18,655
Who are the predicted it's real sad real sad day

1161
01:07:19,679 --> 01:07:20,703
Here's the thing man

1162
01:07:23,263 --> 01:07:24,287
Important

1163
01:07:24,543 --> 01:07:25,823
I do

1164
01:07:26,335 --> 01:07:29,919
He's gone he's really important to wrong disagree if you want to if you want a nice

1165
01:07:30,175 --> 01:07:33,247
Snapshot of some real narcissism

1166
01:07:33,759 --> 01:07:35,039
This is where you're going to find it

1167
01:07:42,207 --> 01:07:43,743
No that won't be too much

1168
01:07:52,703 --> 01:07:53,983
Flown in for an audience

1169
01:07:54,239 --> 01:07:55,007
His lordship

1170
01:08:04,223 --> 01:08:04,735
You killed on the spot

1171
01:08:06,527 --> 01:08:07,295
Dumbasses

1172
01:08:08,063 --> 01:08:09,343
Globalist don't collect

1173
01:08:11,135 --> 01:08:12,159
Like people like me

1174
01:08:13,695 --> 01:08:15,487
They want me to join the New World Order

1175
01:08:17,535 --> 01:08:19,583
You don't have value in their eyes

1176
01:08:19,839 --> 01:08:20,863
You're what they call

1177
01:08:21,375 --> 01:08:22,143
Are useless here

1178
01:08:23,167 --> 01:08:23,935
Are useful

1179
01:08:24,959 --> 01:08:25,983
You're a dumbass

1180
01:08:26,239 --> 01:08:31,103
He's a dumbass three times in less than a minute so I don't know if he has much of Al you

1181
01:08:35,711 --> 01:08:39,807
The value cuz he's so good at yelling he's created a supplement line

1182
01:08:40,063 --> 01:08:40,831
I can't believe

1183
01:08:41,343 --> 01:08:41,855
He thinks

1184
01:08:42,111 --> 01:08:47,487
Anyone will invite him to anywhere

1185
01:08:48,255 --> 01:08:48,767
That's amazing

1186
01:08:49,023 --> 01:08:50,303
I mean that is a real

1187
01:08:50,559 --> 01:08:53,119
Pathetic level of self-aggrandizement

1188
01:08:53,631 --> 01:08:59,775
But I will actually be invited places because the future will need clowns Dan and I will

1189
01:09:00,031 --> 01:09:01,311
Put makeup on my face

1190
01:09:01,567 --> 01:09:04,639
Don't care

1191
01:09:04,895 --> 01:09:08,991
I do remember hearing some folks like begging the stand-up days here

1192
01:09:09,247 --> 01:09:11,807
Folks like maybe late at night at a party

1193
01:09:12,063 --> 01:09:13,599
Talking about how like

1194
01:09:14,111 --> 01:09:14,879
What side is a

1195
01:09:15,135 --> 01:09:19,231
Through hard time to people in need

1196
01:09:19,487 --> 01:09:20,767
Comedy so important

1197
01:09:21,023 --> 01:09:22,303
It is not

1198
01:09:22,559 --> 01:09:24,351
I don't know how positive

1199
01:09:24,607 --> 01:09:25,375
Nobody on the street

1200
01:09:25,631 --> 01:09:26,399
Right now is like

1201
01:09:26,655 --> 01:09:31,775
I got to do my type so I just got to get this out of the way.

1202
01:09:32,287 --> 01:09:34,847
There's enough people out there that there's

1203
01:09:35,103 --> 01:09:37,151
Someone who wants to get a second

1204
01:09:37,663 --> 01:09:43,807
Alex blames Zuckerberg works for Bill Gates blah blah

1205
01:09:44,063 --> 01:09:45,087
Call Bob Delp mobile

1206
01:09:45,343 --> 01:09:45,855
Okay

1207
01:09:47,903 --> 01:09:48,671
Now he is okay

1208
01:09:48,927 --> 01:09:53,023
Truxel fastest military Zuckerberg

1209
01:09:59,679 --> 01:10:01,983
Jake work for you

1210
01:10:10,175 --> 01:10:11,967
This is the biggest thing we've done in

1211
01:10:12,479 --> 01:10:12,991
A year

1212
01:10:13,247 --> 01:10:19,391
Look at it so I can do doing the match lady out there

1213
01:10:19,903 --> 01:10:20,415
Little boy

1214
01:10:22,207 --> 01:10:28,351
I like I like the contractor for this for Satan.

1215
01:10:28,607 --> 01:10:32,703
Bill Gates Bill Gates daughter works for sake subcontract

1216
01:10:32,959 --> 01:10:33,471
Of course

1217
01:10:33,727 --> 01:10:35,519
So dumb

1218
01:10:35,775 --> 01:10:36,287
So stupid

1219
01:10:39,871 --> 01:10:42,943
You're just making sure.

1220
01:10:43,199 --> 01:10:47,039
Alex talks about Susan Rice has come out

1221
01:10:47,295 --> 01:10:49,343
Ion TV talked about

1222
01:10:49,855 --> 01:10:51,135
Some of this stuff

1223
01:10:51,391 --> 01:10:53,951
It's going on is out of the Russian Playbook

1224
01:10:54,463 --> 01:10:54,975
Alex

1225
01:10:55,231 --> 01:10:55,999
Feelings about that

1226
01:10:57,279 --> 01:11:00,351
Play Barack Obama

1227
01:11:00,863 --> 01:11:01,375
Let me

1228
01:11:01,631 --> 01:11:04,959
Witness in major cities is right out

1229
01:11:06,239 --> 01:11:07,519
Is it goes on to say

1230
01:11:09,567 --> 01:11:11,615
Doing this with no proof

1231
01:11:27,743 --> 01:11:33,887
So the argument that Susan Rice's make monthly

1232
01:11:34,399 --> 01:11:38,495
The Russian actors use social media accounts to play both sides of device

1233
01:11:38,751 --> 01:11:39,263
Naked people fighting

1234
01:11:39,519 --> 01:11:40,031
With each other

1235
01:11:40,287 --> 01:11:42,847
She said that she had no idea that was the case

1236
01:11:43,103 --> 01:11:44,639
I'm not reading the

1237
01:11:44,895 --> 01:11:46,175
Today or these days

1238
01:11:46,943 --> 01:11:53,087
She went on to say that we cannot allow ourselves to be distracted from the real problems we have in this country that are lost

1239
01:11:53,343 --> 01:11:54,879
Centuries-old and need to be addressed

1240
01:11:55,135 --> 01:11:55,647
Responsibly

1241
01:11:56,159 --> 01:11:57,695
I don't particularly care about this.

1242
01:11:57,951 --> 01:12:04,095
I'm going to tell there's a little more information behind it

1243
01:12:04,607 --> 01:12:06,911
That's Alex's assertion though which is weird

1244
01:12:07,679 --> 01:12:08,703
Susan Rice is a big global

1245
01:12:08,959 --> 01:12:09,727
Austin Alex's eyes

1246
01:12:09,983 --> 01:12:14,847
So how does it make sense

1247
01:12:15,615 --> 01:12:18,687
I thought that Russia was the thing that they used against things they didn't like like

1248
01:12:19,711 --> 01:12:21,247
Alexander does make no sense

1249
01:12:21,503 --> 01:12:22,783
Even just on a surface level

1250
01:12:23,039 --> 01:12:25,599
And these couple episodes are really full of s*** like this man

1251
01:12:25,855 --> 01:12:31,487
Alex took off

1252
01:12:31,743 --> 01:12:32,767
It's just it's a mess

1253
01:12:34,047 --> 01:12:34,815
Poetic Justice

1254
01:12:35,071 --> 01:12:36,863
Any any any rope

1255
01:12:37,119 --> 01:12:40,447
In 5 minutes draw literally

1256
01:12:40,703 --> 01:12:41,727
Castrating every

1257
01:12:44,543 --> 01:12:46,591
So maybe that's why the Russian

1258
01:12:46,847 --> 01:12:48,895
Doesn't think that you know

1259
01:12:49,151 --> 01:12:50,687
Sing

1260
01:12:51,199 --> 01:12:52,223
Right right

1261
01:12:52,735 --> 01:12:53,759
But with no proof

1262
01:12:54,527 --> 01:12:55,551
Which he's again

1263
01:12:56,575 --> 01:12:57,343
In this circumstance

1264
01:12:57,855 --> 01:12:58,623
Right

1265
01:13:03,487 --> 01:13:06,303
It doesn't really work

1266
01:13:06,815 --> 01:13:11,679
Galaxy still mad at everyone saying this mattress on fire

1267
01:13:11,935 --> 01:13:12,959
Defend himself about it

1268
01:13:13,471 --> 01:13:15,263
What else is mean what is the top of Twitter

1269
01:13:19,103 --> 01:13:19,615
A homeless

1270
01:13:31,135 --> 01:13:32,927
We have the footage released

1271
01:13:33,183 --> 01:13:34,719
Burning

1272
01:13:34,975 --> 01:13:35,487
The whole thing

1273
01:13:46,239 --> 01:13:47,007
This isn't true

1274
01:13:47,263 --> 01:13:52,639
Their timing for Associates in employees are still on Twitter and they're posting a bunch of videos that

1275
01:13:52,895 --> 01:13:54,943
Definitively prove that Alex

1276
01:13:55,199 --> 01:13:57,247
Do show a longer stretch of time

1277
01:13:58,015 --> 01:14:04,159
Saddam Salazar Kaitlin Bennett Millie Weaver Mark Tyson

1278
01:14:04,415 --> 01:14:07,487
Confirm

1279
01:14:07,999 --> 01:14:09,279
They're all still on Twitter

1280
01:14:09,535 --> 01:14:11,839
Protestations

1281
01:14:12,095 --> 01:14:12,607
Innocence

1282
01:14:13,119 --> 01:14:17,983
In order to get right with the script Twitter just needs to let Alex back on Orban all of those

1283
01:14:18,239 --> 01:14:20,287
People because the way it is right now please

1284
01:14:20,543 --> 01:14:21,823
Entirely into Alex's Optics

1285
01:14:22,335 --> 01:14:24,639
He can pretend to be totally abandoned sensor

1286
01:14:24,895 --> 01:14:29,247
Well still haven't conduit with hundreds of thousands of followers to promote is content on the platform

1287
01:14:29,759 --> 01:14:33,343
He's a win-win

1288
01:14:34,111 --> 01:14:40,255
They just need to ban all those f****** people

1289
01:14:40,511 --> 01:14:42,303
To do

1290
01:14:42,815 --> 01:14:44,351
Yeah

1291
01:14:44,607 --> 01:14:49,215
I guess it's probably because they're technically personal accounts or whatever you know

1292
01:14:49,471 --> 01:14:51,263
Dancing stuff

1293
01:14:51,519 --> 01:14:56,895
Prison Planet

1294
01:14:57,151 --> 01:14:59,455
Seems like that one dude is knockout one outside

1295
01:14:59,711 --> 01:15:00,223
I don't know

1296
01:15:00,479 --> 01:15:02,527
Where would I defend myself

1297
01:15:03,039 --> 01:15:09,183
Where could I defend myself I need to go on some sort of media platform I need to have my old one because

1298
01:15:09,439 --> 01:15:11,231
How many people are silencing my voice

1299
01:15:11,487 --> 01:15:12,767
Right now

1300
01:15:21,983 --> 01:15:23,775
Okay

1301
01:15:27,871 --> 01:15:30,431
God

1302
01:15:30,687 --> 01:15:31,967
That's

1303
01:15:32,991 --> 01:15:37,855
Alan Keyes

1304
01:15:38,111 --> 01:15:39,903
He's coming with a bulge

1305
01:15:40,415 --> 01:15:41,183
Alright

1306
01:15:42,463 --> 01:15:43,231
That's protected in the car

1307
01:15:49,375 --> 01:15:50,655
The right of the people

1308
01:15:51,423 --> 01:15:52,191
Pizza Boli's

1309
01:15:55,263 --> 01:15:58,079
If people are out there

1310
01:16:06,015 --> 01:16:06,783
Definition of the United

1311
01:16:07,551 --> 01:16:09,087
What they are actually doing

1312
01:16:12,927 --> 01:16:16,511
And when Insurrection becomes widespread which it has been lately

1313
01:16:21,631 --> 01:16:22,399
The commander-in-chief

1314
01:16:26,751 --> 01:16:28,799
The Army and Navy

1315
01:16:34,943 --> 01:16:37,503
Into the actual service

1316
01:16:39,295 --> 01:16:44,927
He's making an argument a constitutional basis allow

1317
01:16:53,631 --> 01:16:55,935
Save it burning a police station is a

1318
01:16:56,191 --> 01:17:00,799
You Know cover by the Constitution or whatever maybe you could have an interesting conversation about that

1319
01:17:01,055 --> 01:17:05,919
But if you're going to do that then you need to be looking at every single instance where police acted upon

1320
01:17:06,175 --> 01:17:07,455
Peaceful

1321
01:17:07,711 --> 01:17:09,247
Protesters at demonstrators

1322
01:17:09,503 --> 01:17:14,879
And take that just as seriously as you would someone break and I don't see any of that coming

1323
01:17:15,135 --> 01:17:17,439
From Alex's side at all

1324
01:17:17,695 --> 01:17:19,743
David has brought this conversation

1325
01:17:20,511 --> 01:17:23,327
Stupid the constitutionalist Serbian

1326
01:17:23,839 --> 01:17:29,983
Not necessarily

1327
01:17:30,239 --> 01:17:34,335
I forgot about that

1328
01:17:34,591 --> 01:17:35,103
Is interesting

1329
01:17:35,615 --> 01:17:36,383
Shootout in Keys

1330
01:17:36,639 --> 01:17:40,223
I know although they do get into little bit of a slice

1331
01:17:40,479 --> 01:17:44,575
Is a really funny coming up

1332
01:17:44,831 --> 01:17:47,647
I wouldn't call this a novel solution cuz it's

1333
01:17:47,903 --> 01:17:50,719
Somebody said f****** million times

1334
01:17:50,975 --> 01:17:51,743
The situation where at

1335
01:17:51,999 --> 01:17:52,511
Nuketown

1336
01:17:54,303 --> 01:17:56,863
Going after the organisers.

1337
01:18:00,447 --> 01:18:03,007
FBI raids

1338
01:18:03,263 --> 01:18:05,055
Five people.

1339
01:18:06,335 --> 01:18:09,407
Obama Hillary the globalist they're running this

1340
01:18:09,663 --> 01:18:15,039
Martial law

1341
01:18:16,575 --> 01:18:19,391
Listen to that clip you just realize how f****** pathetic Alex's

1342
01:18:19,903 --> 01:18:26,047
Bicurious suggesting at the solution for Trump in this situation is to raid and arrest the people

1343
01:18:26,303 --> 01:18:26,815
Clinton

1344
01:18:27,327 --> 01:18:32,959
2015 and 2016 on the campaign Trail the chance of lock her up broke up broke out at every Trump rally

1345
01:18:33,471 --> 01:18:35,519
People wore Hillary for prison shirts

1346
01:18:35,775 --> 01:18:40,895
The whole thing was such a force in his base that it one of the presidential debates Trump said

1347
01:18:41,151 --> 01:18:46,527
If I win I'm going to instruct my attorney general to get a special prosecutor to look into your situation

1348
01:18:47,551 --> 01:18:50,623
Bnm sardellis 11 instances of trump threaten

1349
01:18:50,879 --> 01:18:51,903
Hillary up

1350
01:18:52,159 --> 01:18:52,671
Or Trump

1351
01:18:52,927 --> 01:18:56,767
Where is telling crowds at his rally that he was going to get a special prosecutor involved

1352
01:18:57,535 --> 01:18:59,327
You didn't do that because you was never gone

1353
01:18:59,583 --> 01:19:05,471
How to do that there was all the publicity strategy years later you have Alex desperately still trying to make it happen

1354
01:19:05,983 --> 01:19:10,079
You have essentially bacon his god-king dictator to enact Vengeance on his imagined enemy

1355
01:19:10,591 --> 01:19:11,103
Juicy I'm just

1356
01:19:11,359 --> 01:19:13,407
Begging Uncle please sir

1357
01:19:13,663 --> 01:19:17,503
I've contradicted all my principles for you won't you at least fight this Evil Woman

1358
01:19:17,759 --> 01:19:20,319
Please sir she runs antifa

1359
01:19:21,087 --> 01:19:24,927
So sad little baby

1360
01:19:25,183 --> 01:19:28,767
The president's people in somewhere

1361
01:19:29,023 --> 01:19:33,375
Good good the president sending people in somewhere

1362
01:19:33,631 --> 01:19:37,983
Send it

1363
01:19:38,239 --> 01:19:41,567
Great place to pick up take a load off

1364
01:19:43,103 --> 01:19:48,223
Newport Beach

1365
01:19:48,479 --> 01:19:52,063
He's already said that he wants like malicious

1366
01:19:52,319 --> 01:19:53,087
Coming in

1367
01:19:53,343 --> 01:19:59,487
I really think that's a bad idea to start deputizing everybody

1368
01:20:05,887 --> 01:20:07,423
What is enters into it

1369
01:20:15,616 --> 01:20:16,128
To the country

1370
01:20:16,384 --> 01:20:16,896
Pointing

1371
01:20:26,112 --> 01:20:31,232
Allen keys does not like Alex style interrupting everybody all the time

1372
01:20:39,424 --> 01:20:44,544
I don't blame you

1373
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:46,848
It's weird to hear Alex I kind of have to take it

1374
01:20:47,872 --> 01:20:52,736
Was a dude ran for president if you got keys in your way you got to get steamrolled by him

1375
01:20:52,992 --> 01:20:55,808
Conversation is pointless

1376
01:20:56,064 --> 01:20:59,648
I made it Beyond am just saying like Trump needs to Posse up

1377
01:21:01,952 --> 01:21:02,976
All right guys

1378
01:21:03,232 --> 01:21:03,744
You guys

1379
01:21:04,256 --> 01:21:08,608
Really wish that somebody would be like oh okay if I looked into a mirror

1380
01:21:08,864 --> 01:21:11,680
All the sudden magically a swastika appear

1381
01:21:11,936 --> 01:21:14,496
These people are out-and-out Nazis

1382
01:21:14,752 --> 01:21:15,264
Better

1383
01:21:15,520 --> 01:21:16,032
That's not

1384
01:21:17,568 --> 01:21:23,712
Little brown church

1385
01:21:23,968 --> 01:21:25,504
These are going to win World War 2

1386
01:21:26,016 --> 01:21:27,808
It's bumming me out

1387
01:21:28,064 --> 01:21:30,112
Well you might be

1388
01:21:31,392 --> 01:21:34,720
The interview with Alan Keyes ends and now Alex gets into

1389
01:21:35,488 --> 01:21:37,024
Nice

1390
01:21:38,816 --> 01:21:39,328
I'll be honest with you

1391
01:21:40,352 --> 01:21:41,120
Check the last few months ago

1392
01:21:41,376 --> 01:21:41,888
What's happening

1393
01:21:42,912 --> 01:21:44,192
Pulaski days out of

1394
01:21:45,472 --> 01:21:45,984
But I like

1395
01:21:47,520 --> 01:21:48,544
Because I meet a tall you

1396
01:21:48,800 --> 01:21:49,824
Trendys all you people

1397
01:22:02,368 --> 01:22:04,160
Around your neck

1398
01:22:17,984 --> 01:22:19,008
Memorial Day is he

1399
01:22:19,520 --> 01:22:20,800
God dammit

1400
01:22:23,616 --> 01:22:28,224
He is never going to get in trouble for not saying politically there

1401
01:22:28,736 --> 01:22:31,296
He is such a he's such a douche

1402
01:22:31,808 --> 01:22:33,600
Talking

1403
01:22:33,856 --> 01:22:36,928
But I want to start a literal hot water

1404
01:22:37,440 --> 01:22:43,584
Not no political there I want to kill all of my specifically

1405
01:22:43,840 --> 01:22:49,984
Trying to antagonize

1406
01:22:50,240 --> 01:22:55,616
People I say have fake contract with the antifa

1407
01:22:56,128 --> 01:22:58,432
I would never say that cuz I gotta protect

1408
01:22:58,688 --> 01:22:59,456
The revenue stream

1409
01:22:59,712 --> 01:23:00,736
Court and so ominous

1410
01:23:00,992 --> 01:23:02,016
Lytic lesion

1411
01:23:02,272 --> 01:23:04,320
But didn't forget to say it a little while

1412
01:23:05,344 --> 01:23:05,856
Not good.

1413
01:23:06,112 --> 01:23:08,160
So Alex gets back to this o'bricks

1414
01:23:08,416 --> 01:23:08,928
Story

1415
01:23:09,184 --> 01:23:10,208
And this is funny to me

1416
01:23:14,816 --> 01:23:15,584
20 studies delivered

1417
01:23:23,264 --> 01:23:25,056
Just took off

1418
01:23:27,872 --> 01:23:29,152
Kill the police murderer

1419
01:23:37,344 --> 01:23:43,488
I know because I have my phone

1420
01:23:43,744 --> 01:23:44,512
You sure they did didn't

1421
01:23:44,768 --> 01:23:47,328
Alex

1422
01:23:47,584 --> 01:23:48,352
He double-checked it

1423
01:23:48,608 --> 01:23:53,216
Watch that qanon video game

1424
01:23:53,472 --> 01:23:58,080
Congratulations

1425
01:23:58,336 --> 01:24:04,224
He has a responsibility to prove that Acme Brick delivered bricks specifically for these protests

1426
01:24:04,480 --> 01:24:07,552
Turn violent United States

1427
01:24:07,808 --> 01:24:09,344
Off the hook with the

1428
01:24:09,600 --> 01:24:11,904
Just press the button teleporting thing

1429
01:24:12,160 --> 01:24:18,304
I don't care about that so he said he's confirmed

1430
01:24:18,560 --> 01:24:19,072
Solid

1431
01:24:19,328 --> 01:24:20,608
Concrete like a brick pack

1432
01:24:20,864 --> 01:24:22,144
You're really going to have to prove

1433
01:24:22,400 --> 01:24:24,448
20 things if you say there's 20 City

1434
01:24:25,216 --> 01:24:29,056
Oh yeah

1435
01:24:29,312 --> 01:24:29,824
5

1436
01:24:30,080 --> 01:24:32,640
It's still not 20%

1437
01:24:33,152 --> 01:24:34,432
So Alex

1438
01:24:37,760 --> 01:24:39,296
Marshall Law basically

1439
01:24:40,064 --> 01:24:41,088
You understand

1440
01:24:42,624 --> 01:24:43,648
Starting point

1441
01:24:43,904 --> 01:24:44,416
We have to

1442
01:24:48,768 --> 01:24:50,304
Is not shutting them down

1443
01:24:53,120 --> 01:24:53,888
The anti-fascist

1444
01:24:58,240 --> 01:25:00,032
We're here now this is where we were brought

1445

01:25:40,480 --> 01:25:42,272
You're calling for decapitation

1461
01:25:49,952 --> 01:25:52,000
Telling them now as representative

1462
01:25:57,376 --> 01:25:58,912
If we're anybody wants to kill you

1463
01:25:59,424 --> 01:25:59,936
Because you

1464
01:26:03,008 --> 01:26:03,520

Soros

1472
01:26:38,592 --> 01:26:39,616
All these other people

1473
01:26:42,944 --> 01:26:44,480
Because they're already dead

1474
01:26:46,528 --> 01:26:47,296
You need to die

1475
01:26:47,808 --> 01:26:48,576

01:26:53,184 --> 01:26:53,952
Political

1478
01:26:56,768 --> 01:27:02,400
Soros would be turned into a martyr for the left

1479
01:27:04,704 --> 01:27:08,032
Streets out there they kill Soros

1480
01:27:08,288 --> 01:27:11,616

1482
01:27:14,944 --> 01:27:16,480
But I don't want that

1483
01:27:16,736 --> 01:27:18,016
Pretty mad at the end

1484
01:27:18,272 --> 01:27:21,088
Doesn't undo the emotional effect

1485
01:27:24,672 --> 01:27:25,952
I forgot about that

1486
01:27:26,720 --> 01:27:27,744
Yeah absolutely

1487
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:29,024

Now that's that's how she should go to protest

1494
01:27:41,824 --> 01:27:45,664
Yes that was the original idea

1495
01:27:45,920 --> 01:27:52,064
Blend in with the sjw that was the point where rainbows

1496
01:27:52,320 --> 01:27:58,464
Yes I'm starting to think that that wasn't a good idea

1497
01:27:58,720 --> 01:28:00,256
Using one character I would love it

1498
01:28:00,512 --> 01:28:06,144

This is Pulitzer work

1503
01:28:16,384 --> 01:28:17,664
Okay

1504
01:28:19,456 --> 01:28:20,224
Breaking news

1505
01:28:20,480 --> 01:28:23,808
Premature we were hoping to get it out later

1506
01:28:24,832 --> 01:28:25,600

1507
01:28:26,112 --> 01:28:26,624

Problem is is they stop

1509
01:28:29,184 --> 01:28:30,464
Make sure that we had anticipated

1510
01:28:30,976 --> 01:28:31,488
We have had

1511
01:28:32,512 --> 01:28:33,536
Trader that was the problem

1512
01:28:33,792 --> 01:28:36,864
Green movement

1513
01:28:39,680 --> 01:28:41,472
We are going to start releasing the document

1514
01:28:42,496 --> 01:28:43,264

1526
01:29:13,728 --> 01:29:14,752
Is insane what we have

1527
01:29:15,264 --> 01:29:19,360
If you have all of this information and you can't come up with something

1528
01:29:20,128 --> 01:29:26,016
Disquieting

1529
01:29:27,040 --> 01:29:29,600
Anyway Alex wants Miley to lay it out

1530
01:29:29,856 --> 01:29:33,440
What was going on what are you

1531
01:29:33,952 --> 01:29:40,096
Alex always expects her to lay it out

1532
01:29:40,352 --> 01:29:45,984
With it there's a glass ceiling in a far better work than Alex if

1533
01:29:46,240 --> 01:29:47,008
I didn't take all this

1534
01:29:49,568 --> 01:29:50,080
She's at least

1535
01:29:50,336 --> 01:29:50,848
Trying

1536
01:29:51,104 --> 01:29:57,248
Keeps interrupting her and cheese

1537
01:29:58,528 --> 01:30:00,576
Begin at the beginning

1538
01:30:02,368 --> 01:30:04,160
Thousand years ago

1539
01:30:05,952 --> 01:30:06,464

Cats are in League with these

1546
01:30:19,264 --> 01:30:19,776
These groups

1547
01:30:24,128 --> 01:30:25,408
They just think they're allowed to do this

1548
01:30:25,664 --> 01:30:28,992
You just can't stop getting in the making of the mix

1549
01:30:29,248 --> 01:30:31,296
She can't get her sentences out about what her big

1550
01:30:31,552 --> 01:30:33,088
Conspiracy that she's uncovered is

1551
01:30:34,112 --> 01:30:34,880
About me

1552
01:30:35,136 --> 01:30:35,648
Mommy

1553
01:30:35,904 --> 01:30:42,048
So anyway I guess she's got these documents and what have you but she hasn't released them so I don't have any way to assess what you think

1554
01:30:42,304 --> 01:30:48,448
Even talking about really hard cuz they're on the server

1555
01:30:48,704 --> 01:30:52,288
We have so much stuff

1556
01:30:53,568 --> 01:30:59,712
Somebody here a lot of stuff we can't do

1557
01:30:59,968 --> 01:31:01,760
So much so much truth

1558
01:31:02,016 --> 01:31:08,160
Talk about any other I really meant to get into those thousands of documents we just ran out of time in this hour

1559
01:31:08,416 --> 01:31:09,184
Hour-long interview

1560
01:31:09,440 --> 01:31:15,584
So I guess this is part of it I don't know necessarily but apparently I don't have to do this

1561
01:31:15,840 --> 01:31:17,888
Coronavirus non-existent or something

1562
01:31:18,144 --> 01:31:19,936
Getting everyone to wear masks

1563
01:31:20,448 --> 01:31:21,216

01:31:23,776 --> 01:31:25,312
Been pushing for all these masks

1566
01:31:27,104 --> 01:31:27,616
Their plan

1567
01:31:27,872 --> 01:31:30,688
They can use the mass to be able to go out there concealer eye

1568
01:31:30,944 --> 01:31:32,736
Identity theft

1569
01:31:33,760 --> 01:31:35,040

Do you believe

1574
01:31:50,400 --> 01:31:50,912
You just said it.

01:31:52,192 --> 01:31:54,240
Deep stuff everyone's wearing a mask

01:31:59,616 --> 01:32:01,152
Nobody's ever worn masks

1579
01:32:02,176 --> 01:32:04,736
As we all know Auntie invented the first match

1580
01:32:04,992 --> 01:32:10,112
Celebrate for that and then we took advantage

1581
01:32:10,624 --> 01:32:13,952
They took advantage of their Brilliant Invention in order to

1582
01:32:14,208 --> 01:32:18,304
Blend in with us and as we all know blending in makes you feel very powerful

1583
01:32:18,560 --> 01:32:21,120
True individual

01:32:51,840 --> 01:32:53,120
Thinking about fortune cookies

1591
01:33:05,920 --> 01:33:07,968
Determination

Control your will.

1602
01:33:49,440 --> 01:33:49,952

Post office

1625
01:35:01,888 --> 01:35:03,936
The military police were able to make

01:35:04,192 --> 01:35:04,704
Large array

1627
01:35:06,752 --> 01:35:08,032

01:35:15,200 --> 01:35:16,224
Get the terrorist

1635
01:35:17,504 --> 01:35:19,040
Officer all on social media

1636
01:35:19,296 --> 01:35:20,576
These are peaceful protest

1637
01:35:20,832 --> 01:35:21,856
Masterpiece Old Pro

1638
01:35:22,624 --> 01:35:23,392
No they're not

1639
01:35:23,904 --> 01:35:25,184
Criminals peaceful protest

1640
01:35:25,696 --> 01:35:26,464
Don't break the law

1641
01:35:26,720 --> 01:35:27,744
They don't commit crimes

1642
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:30,304
Okay they won't be out there because they wouldn't be wanting to buy

1643
01:35:31,840 --> 01:35:34,144
Wow

1644
01:35:35,168 --> 01:35:40,288
Bad stuff that is the power we want for our movement

1645
01:35:40,544 --> 01:35:43,360
Everyone in the hard right movement make

1646
01:35:43,616 --> 01:35:49,760
Sure you submit your curfew don't courage great otherwise you're not a peaceful protest

1647
01:35:50,016 --> 01:35:50,784
You're a criminal

1648
01:35:51,040 --> 01:35:52,832
I mean

1649
01:35:53,088 --> 01:35:59,232
Daughter singing for curfew

1650
01:35:59,744 --> 01:36:05,888
Licorice kiss this kind of like

1651
01:36:06,144 --> 01:36:10,240
All these people in masks because they're out

1652
01:36:10,496 --> 01:36:11,520
Wow

1653
01:36:12,288 --> 01:36:18,432
You know what I think the military police should absolutely perform a pincer movement in order to trap a large group of

1654
01:36:18,688 --> 01:36:20,736
People on a bridge that they cannot Escape

1655
01:36:20,992 --> 01:36:27,136
And then of course fire non-lethal weapons into a crowd indiscriminately now I think that's a good idea

1656
01:36:27,392 --> 01:36:28,672
8 pm

1657
01:36:29,952 --> 01:36:36,096
You bring up something else that's really interesting accidentally and that is Alex missed his opportunities to pincer movement

1658
01:36:36,608 --> 01:36:37,632
She loves to do

1659
01:36:37,888 --> 01:36:43,776
Is Deathstroke update on the Trump family

1660
01:36:44,032 --> 01:36:45,824
Are they on fire yet

1661
01:36:48,896 --> 01:36:51,712
Have you noticed that

1662
01:36:52,992 --> 01:36:53,504
Totally

1663
01:36:53,760 --> 01:36:55,296
Risking his job everything to say that

1664
01:36:56,576 --> 01:36:58,624
For the Deep state is literally sabotaging Trump

1665
01:36:59,136 --> 01:37:01,184
Here's a couple things I want to say if Tucker

1666
01:37:01,440 --> 01:37:04,000
Carlson critiquing Jared Kushner is risking his job

1667
01:37:04,256 --> 01:37:10,400
That's indicative of a problem

1668
01:37:10,656 --> 01:37:11,424
Should

1669
01:37:11,680 --> 01:37:15,008
Criticize those in power

1670
01:37:15,264 --> 01:37:21,408
Need to make sure feel threatened

1671
01:37:21,664 --> 01:37:27,808
Alex just says that it looked at all examine the idea of what

1672
01:37:28,064 --> 01:37:28,576
Frazee

1673
01:37:28,832 --> 01:37:30,112
And the second thing

1674
01:37:30,880 --> 01:37:31,648
Cuckoo bananas

1675
01:37:33,440 --> 01:37:34,208
Alright

1676
01:37:34,464 --> 01:37:35,744
Let's imagine Alex's right

1677
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:37,280
Jared kushner's the Deep state

1678
01:37:38,048 --> 01:37:40,864
No one wants him to be there

1679
01:37:44,960 --> 01:37:45,472
Yes

1680
01:37:45,728 --> 01:37:49,568
It's not like he has some kind of policy expertise

1681
01:37:49,824 --> 01:37:52,384
Tires that likes o you know what yeah maybe

1682
01:37:52,640 --> 01:37:58,784
Maybe he has a little bit maybe he's affiliated with some think tanks or whatever but he's just so damn good

1683
01:37:59,040 --> 01:38:05,184
Ematic alright we're going to orchestrate

1684
01:38:05,440 --> 01:38:09,024
Shadow idea we need for the job

1685
01:38:09,280 --> 01:38:10,048
F****** Kush

1686
01:38:10,304 --> 01:38:15,168
Let's do we got to get on ourselves let's get Trump's bucking son-in-law

1687
01:38:15,424 --> 01:38:17,216
In order to implant

1688
01:38:17,472 --> 01:38:19,008
What the hell is going on here

1689
01:38:19,520 --> 01:38:21,824
Here's what we need we need a spoil

1690
01:38:22,080 --> 01:38:23,104
Bridge motherfuker

1691
01:38:23,616 --> 01:38:25,920
In order to get our

1692
01:38:26,944 --> 01:38:30,272
Alex does this game with Kushner all the time

1693
01:38:30,528 --> 01:38:34,368
Like he's in and out on that dude all the f****** time

1694
01:38:34,880 --> 01:38:39,744
It's so it's so strange to me like how many times he's turned face and turned heel

1695
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:40,512
It's

1696
01:38:42,048 --> 01:38:45,120
This for the wrestling as well beat the Big Show

1697
01:38:45,376 --> 01:38:47,168
He poops a lot

1698
01:38:48,192 --> 01:38:51,008
I don't know man I can't really get interested in this

1699
01:38:51,264 --> 01:38:57,408
But it's funny hilarious

1700
01:38:57,664 --> 01:38:58,432
Main Street

1701
01:38:58,688 --> 01:38:59,968
How much is

1702
01:39:00,224 --> 01:39:06,368
Fox News is a propaganda Network and if they speak out against their leader

1703
01:39:06,624 --> 01:39:09,184
What does l

1704
01:39:10,208 --> 01:39:14,048
Luckily hired someone lost

1705
01:39:14,304 --> 01:39:18,912
So Billy gets to talk about how

1706
01:39:19,680 --> 01:39:21,984
That she has a few things

1707
01:39:22,240 --> 01:39:22,752
Write about

1708
01:39:23,008 --> 01:39:24,288
This big ass

1709
01:39:24,544 --> 01:39:26,336
She's got

1710
01:39:26,592 --> 01:39:28,640
Peabody Pulitzer

1711
01:39:28,896 --> 01:39:35,040
You got for it even though it's not a musical

1712
01:39:35,296 --> 01:39:39,136
TV show true

1713
01:39:40,672 --> 01:39:41,440
Released

1714
01:39:41,696 --> 01:39:44,256
Tomorrow started already released video today

1715
01:39:44,768 --> 01:39:45,792
Private internal copper

1716
01:39:46,048 --> 01:39:46,560
Prince's work

1717
01:39:48,096 --> 01:39:48,608
Osseo Cortez

1718
01:39:49,120 --> 01:39:50,400
Is calling for more uprising

1719
01:39:51,936 --> 01:39:52,960
Pictures of the rides that we're seeing

1720
01:39:53,728 --> 01:39:54,752
Publicly she sang

1721
01:39:56,032 --> 01:39:56,800
She saying everyone should know

1722
01:39:58,080 --> 01:39:59,104
We got that out today

1723
01:39:59,360 --> 01:40:02,688
Video released of AOC

1724
01:40:02,944 --> 01:40:05,760
It's not her saying that there should be more uprisings or anyting

1725
01:40:06,016 --> 01:40:12,160
Cortez making the point that we can make all of this

1726
01:40:12,672 --> 01:40:13,184
People to protest

1727
01:40:13,440 --> 01:40:13,952
In the first place

1728
01:40:14,464 --> 01:40:20,352
That's an argument that super threatening to Alex Because deep down invest in the status quo

1729
01:40:21,632 --> 01:40:22,912
Discuss a possible shifting

1730
01:40:23,168 --> 01:40:25,472
Traditional power dynamics

1731
01:40:25,984 --> 01:40:27,776
Any instinctually labels as the work of the global

1732
01:40:28,800 --> 01:40:31,872
We'll see what millions of releasing

1733
01:40:32,384 --> 01:40:36,224
This ends up being a disappointment

1734
01:40:36,736 --> 01:40:39,808
This isn't about any actual documents they got from a server or

1735
01:40:40,064 --> 01:40:43,904
Russell resume Billy might have dropped something interesting at all interview

1736
01:40:44,160 --> 01:40:49,536
It's kind of just a theatrical piece that exists in order for Alex to say stuff like this

1737
01:40:52,608 --> 01:40:53,376
Boy Scouts

1738
01:40:54,400 --> 01:40:56,192
The stuff is so horrible.

1739
01:40:58,240 --> 01:40:58,752
Weird

1740
01:41:02,848 --> 01:41:07,200
Jeffrey Dahmer looking people like

1741
01:41:07,712 --> 01:41:13,344
Alex needs his own project Veritas style stories of about a million

1742
01:41:13,856 --> 01:41:17,696
I have no idea if they have a mole at all of this server mirror

1743
01:41:17,952 --> 01:41:24,096
This recording recorded Zoom call but you could have gotten some other way

1744
01:41:24,352 --> 01:41:27,424
Screenshots of public websites and a guy's LinkedIn

1745
01:41:27,680 --> 01:41:32,288
We'll see what comes of this forwards do not give your hopes

1746
01:41:35,616 --> 01:41:37,408
So Alex has racks on

1747
01:41:39,456 --> 01:41:45,344
Raining off and waste my time

1748
01:41:45,600 --> 01:41:49,440
Talking about how f*****-up it is that Alex is talking about how his son beat up a guy in a

1749
01:41:49,696 --> 01:41:50,976
Convenience store

1750
01:41:53,280 --> 01:41:55,328
No but there were two things

1751
01:41:55,584 --> 01:41:56,096
Worthpoint

1752
01:41:56,352 --> 01:41:56,864
Here's the first

1753
01:41:58,144 --> 01:42:00,192
My little baby's here my first-born Rex

1754
01:42:00,704 --> 01:42:02,496
So I don't want to talk about this like I said

1755
01:42:03,008 --> 01:42:04,288
Cuz I think it's inappropriate

1756
01:42:04,800 --> 01:42:08,640
I only keep this clip-in because Alex says that Rex is his first born

1757
01:42:08,896 --> 01:42:09,920
And that made me think of something

1758
01:42:10,176 --> 01:42:10,688
What's that

1759
01:42:10,944 --> 01:42:17,088
According to Alex the race memory of a person is passed out to their firstborn son and strips

1760
01:42:17,344 --> 01:42:19,648
And then she becomes a queen

1761
01:42:19,904 --> 01:42:20,928
But here's where things get murky

1762
01:42:21,696 --> 01:42:24,000
Alex's said that he's paid for a ton of abortion

1763
01:42:24,256 --> 01:42:26,560
Before

1764
01:42:26,816 --> 01:42:29,376
One of those children would be his first born son

1765
01:42:29,632 --> 01:42:31,936
Rexburg

1766
01:42:32,192 --> 01:42:35,776
Keyboard

1767
01:42:37,056 --> 01:42:39,872
At the point where Alex chose to terminate

1768
01:42:40,128 --> 01:42:41,664
His partner whole thing with John

1769
01:42:42,176 --> 01:42:47,552
Fertilize their eggs and development

1770
01:42:48,064 --> 01:42:48,832
So here's my point

1771
01:42:49,344 --> 01:42:55,232
If Alex is theory about race memory means anything but either Rex doesn't have Alex's race memory

1772
01:42:55,488 --> 01:42:58,816
And in fact the inheritor that race memory was

1773
01:42:59,584 --> 01:43:00,096
Or

1774
01:43:00,352 --> 01:43:01,888
Rex does have race memory

1775
01:43:02,144 --> 01:43:04,448
Then it can't have anything to do with the father

1776
01:43:04,960 --> 01:43:05,472
If that's the case

1777
01:43:05,728 --> 01:43:06,240
Possible

1778
01:43:07,008 --> 01:43:13,152
Okay sorry has to be in Rex has race memory it has to be entirely something

1779
01:43:13,408 --> 01:43:15,200
Things related to the interaction between a fetus

1780
01:43:15,456 --> 01:43:17,248
Since mother again here's where

1781
01:43:17,504 --> 01:43:18,528
Here's where we're in trouble with

1782
01:43:19,296 --> 01:43:23,392
All right because this could absolutely invalidate everything he says about him

1783
01:43:23,648 --> 01:43:24,160
Abortion

1784
01:43:24,672 --> 01:43:26,208
If he says to me

1785
01:43:26,464 --> 01:43:29,280
That the soul doesn't enter

1786
01:43:29,536 --> 01:43:31,328
Or the race memory doesn't enter

1787
01:43:31,584 --> 01:43:33,120
Until the child is born

1788
01:43:33,376 --> 01:43:34,400
Guess what's fine

1789
01:43:36,448 --> 01:43:42,336
Zeit now Finding Dory

1790
01:43:42,592 --> 01:43:43,616
Or he's full of f***

1791
01:43:44,896 --> 01:43:48,736
I think it's possible but even with your rebuttal he could wiggle out of it

1792
01:43:48,992 --> 01:43:54,368
We will sure only a thing for the first born son

1793
01:43:55,392 --> 01:43:57,184
All the other aborted babies

1794
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:06,144
Something that I think is really really interesting to consider it a little implications

1795
01:44:06,400 --> 01:44:12,032
He's never consider

1796
01:44:12,288 --> 01:44:16,640
They're just a means to hide a chauvinist worldview behind romantic mystical ideas

1797
01:44:17,152 --> 01:44:21,760
He's never even given any thought to the process he believes that the most important thing in the world

1798
01:44:22,016 --> 01:44:26,368
You just making all this s*** up so you can sound deep as opposed to just saying what he means

1799
01:44:26,624 --> 01:44:29,696
He believes that women are inferior to men apparently

1800
01:44:29,952 --> 01:44:36,096
Fort George Lucas not giving chewy a metal theme to Star Wars

1801
01:44:36,608 --> 01:44:40,960
F****** racism

1802
01:44:41,216 --> 01:44:47,360
Do not give him a

1803
01:44:47,616 --> 01:44:49,408
Not going to give him a f******

1804
01:44:49,664 --> 01:44:55,808
Erase memory exist need to explain to either your son does not have race memory

1805
01:45:00,416 --> 01:45:01,440
Yeah

1806
01:45:01,952 --> 01:45:03,232
You need to

1807
01:45:03,488 --> 01:45:05,024
Explain to me

1808
01:45:05,280 --> 01:45:09,120
Erase memory has nothing to do with you and everything to do with

1809
01:45:09,376 --> 01:45:10,912
You are a spouse or mate

1810
01:45:11,168 --> 01:45:12,448
That case

1811
01:45:13,472 --> 01:45:19,360
I do I don't even care you need to prove to me that race memory

1812
01:45:20,128 --> 01:45:24,480
Yeah I mean I don't believe that either but I just like to have fun with his super delayed

1813
01:45:24,992 --> 01:45:27,808
So here's the last clip that we have and

1814
01:45:28,064 --> 01:45:29,344
Such a bummer

1815
01:45:30,880 --> 01:45:34,720
You would do something and then at one point I guess I had to jump in and do something

1816
01:45:37,024 --> 01:45:38,816
I was terrified but I mean I had to do it

1817
01:45:39,072 --> 01:45:41,632
And now that we love our somalis

1818
01:45:42,400 --> 01:45:45,984
Tamales

1819
01:45:46,496 --> 01:45:48,544
We love our Muslims too

1820
01:45:52,384 --> 01:45:56,736
I hate talking about Alex's family because I tried to go out of my way to leave his personal life alone

1821
01:45:56,992 --> 01:45:59,552
This however was something that I think is important to bring up

1822
01:45:59,808 --> 01:46:03,136
If you ever need any bigotry is a learned behavior

1823
01:46:03,392 --> 01:46:04,160
Here you have it

1824
01:46:04,928 --> 01:46:10,304
There's no indication that the person that wrecks beat-up was from Somalia or a Muslim become a code

1825
01:46:10,560 --> 01:46:11,328
On Alex's show

1826
01:46:11,840 --> 01:46:15,680
The person who made with Alex

1827
01:46:15,936 --> 01:46:17,728
Dial Alex

1828
01:46:17,984 --> 01:46:22,080
Whenever he found an instance of any violence that was done by a person who happens to be a Muslim

1829
01:46:22,592 --> 01:46:27,712
Eddie transformed the song show everyone always makes fun of him

1830
01:46:27,968 --> 01:46:29,504
But he's actually right about it all

1831
01:46:30,784 --> 01:46:33,600
Basically the same sort of gas that you're giving

1832
01:46:33,856 --> 01:46:36,160
When you accuse him of setting a mattress on fire

1833
01:46:36,416 --> 01:46:38,720
The song in the code on Alex's

1834
01:46:40,256 --> 01:46:41,024
Its original context

1835
01:46:41,536 --> 01:46:47,680
And you can see here how a father and son joined together to sing a song that's explicitly about 18 by norty group because you're scared of

1836
01:46:48,704 --> 01:46:54,848
And that's what's going on

1837
01:46:55,872 --> 01:46:58,688
I mean

1838
01:47:00,480 --> 01:47:02,528
I can't imagine

1839
01:47:02,784 --> 01:47:04,064
I can't believe that

1840
01:47:04,576 --> 01:47:05,088
Alex

1841
01:47:05,600 --> 01:47:09,696
Is covering a video of his son beating up somebody at a convenience store

1842
01:47:10,976 --> 01:47:12,256
Their conversation is

1843
01:47:12,512 --> 01:47:13,024
Worse

1844
01:47:13,280 --> 01:47:14,048
Then just that

1845
01:47:14,560 --> 01:47:15,584
You know it's it's

1846
01:47:15,840 --> 01:47:16,608
It's bad

1847
01:47:16,864 --> 01:47:18,656
It's really really disgusting

1848
01:47:19,168 --> 01:47:21,216
So I may we come to the end of this age

1849
01:47:21,472 --> 01:47:24,288
Something I find a little bit interesting is that like

1850
01:47:25,056 --> 01:47:26,336
Eurokies

1851
01:47:26,848 --> 01:47:27,360
Really

1852
01:47:28,896 --> 01:47:31,456
Pretty much staying on similar tracks

1853
01:47:31,712 --> 01:47:32,480
But he's been on

1854
01:47:32,992 --> 01:47:34,784
In terms of the

1855
01:47:35,040 --> 01:47:41,184
Trying to invalidate George Floyd's murder to make it palatable to his audience

1856
01:47:41,440 --> 01:47:42,208
Not a big deal

1857
01:47:42,720 --> 01:47:43,744
And then second the

1858
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:46,048
Conspiracy theory Rising about the protest

1859
01:47:46,304 --> 01:47:47,072
Demonstration

1860
01:47:47,328 --> 01:47:48,352
All this stuff is

1861
01:47:48,608 --> 01:47:49,632
Continuing unabated

1862
01:47:50,144 --> 01:47:54,240
You know you have the the Brick narratives I was assigned a great amount of Comfort Inn

1863
01:47:54,752 --> 01:47:59,616
He's got a ratings Bonanza coming through with the mattress fire

1864
01:48:00,128 --> 01:48:05,760
Trajectory wise is 8

1865
01:48:06,016 --> 01:48:07,808
Calls for blood

1866
01:48:08,064 --> 01:48:11,392
Yeah you're seeing that and you're seeing him have people like Alan Keyes

1867
01:48:11,648 --> 01:48:12,672
Come on to give like a

1868
01:48:12,928 --> 01:48:14,976
A weird constitutional rationalization

1869
01:48:15,232 --> 01:48:17,024
Denver coffee and up and having

1870
01:48:17,536 --> 01:48:19,072
I guess armed civilians

1871
01:48:19,328 --> 01:48:19,840
Fighting

1872
01:48:20,096 --> 01:48:24,960
Alongside National Guard people or whatever which seems nightmarish

1873
01:48:25,216 --> 01:48:25,728
It's it's

1874
01:48:25,984 --> 01:48:26,752
Really

1875
01:48:27,264 --> 01:48:27,776
Jarring

1876
01:48:28,032 --> 01:48:30,336
It's really jarring to find out

1877
01:48:30,592 --> 01:48:33,408
Just how few people are living in 2020

1878
01:48:33,920 --> 01:48:35,968
And how many are living in

1879
01:48:36,224 --> 01:48:36,736
Like

1880
01:48:36,992 --> 01:48:38,528
This old time of like

1881
01:48:39,296 --> 01:48:42,624
Fascism is fine we need to fire upon

1882
01:48:42,880 --> 01:48:44,416
Nobody is learned that lesson

1883
01:48:44,672 --> 01:48:46,464
Over and over and over again

1884
01:48:47,232 --> 01:48:48,000
Very tough

1885
01:48:50,304 --> 01:48:51,584
Everybody just keeps

1886
01:48:51,840 --> 01:48:52,864
Thinking man

1887
01:48:53,120 --> 01:48:55,168
I'm going to be a higher up

1888
01:48:55,424 --> 01:48:57,728
In the fascist order

1889
01:48:57,984 --> 01:49:00,032
I'm going to take a level up

1890
01:49:00,288 --> 01:49:01,056
In fascism

1891
01:49:01,568 --> 01:49:02,080
So I am

1892
01:49:02,336 --> 01:49:02,848
Profesh

1893
01:49:03,360 --> 01:49:03,872
Immediately

1894
01:49:04,384 --> 01:49:09,504
No no problems there so I'm safe from it

1895
01:49:09,760 --> 01:49:11,296
Insane to me that we've

1896
01:49:11,552 --> 01:49:15,648
We've normalize this so much and we're super in a year where

1897
01:49:16,160 --> 01:49:16,672
F******

1898
01:49:16,928 --> 01:49:18,208
Amphibious cars

1899
01:49:18,720 --> 01:49:24,864
I can't have him fibia scars and now she's running America you know like I just can't do it

1900
01:49:25,120 --> 01:49:26,912
Yeah what do you think about Alex

1901
01:49:27,424 --> 01:49:28,448
Like on this episode

1902
01:49:30,752 --> 01:49:32,544
I don't know he seems very fake

1903
01:49:33,312 --> 01:49:39,456
The only thing that seemed generally like that whole screaming speech like Phyllis price

1904
01:49:39,968 --> 01:49:41,248
Yeah but this is just

1905
01:49:42,784 --> 01:49:44,320
Is this a real f******

1906
01:49:47,136 --> 01:49:47,904
Stop at you man

1907
01:49:50,976 --> 01:49:52,256
Does not like that

1908
01:49:53,280 --> 01:49:54,816
Subway

1909
01:49:56,864 --> 01:50:00,192
Until then we website

1910
01:50:00,448 --> 01:50:06,592
We are on

1911
01:50:06,848 --> 01:50:12,992
And if you could please donate to a aggregators

1912
01:50:13,248 --> 01:50:14,784
Spread that money across a large number

1913
01:50:15,296 --> 01:50:16,320
Yes please

1914
01:50:22,720 --> 01:50:24,768
Holding

1915
01:50:26,816 --> 01:50:27,840
Alex

1916
01:50:28,096 --> 01:50:29,888
I love your work
