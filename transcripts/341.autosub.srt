00:01:05,536 --> 00:01:08,096
About Alex Jones

00:01:08,352 --> 00:01:09,888
Jordan Jordan

6
00:01:10,144 --> 00:01:10,656
What is the

7
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,448
You've ever waited

8
00:01:12,704 --> 00:01:13,216
4A

9
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,032
Or a bar

10
00:01:16,544 --> 00:01:20,640
Do you remember when we were in Austin and there's that barbecue place

11
00:01:21,152 --> 00:01:27,296
You up for our way out everyday

12
00:01:28,832 --> 00:01:30,112
It must be incredible

13
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:33,440
It must be incredible I would never wait for our

14
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:37,280
New York Subway call ahead for catering and then

15
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:38,816
Forgo the line

16
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:43,424
It's just a highly in demand barbecue place

17
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:46,496
I don't know I don't I can't think of anything

18
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:47,264
B released

19
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:53,664
Sticks out in my head because I don't go in for that at all.

20
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:54,688
Rather get something

21
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,248
Left good

22
00:01:57,504 --> 00:02:00,832
Right I know that there have been times when I've waited before because I have

23
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:01,600
Play kiddo

24
00:02:02,112 --> 00:02:04,160
Vague flashes of memories

25
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:04,928
Those disks

26
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:10,560
They give you that light up with Marissa

27
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:12,608
I can't I can't really think

28
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:13,376
Think of many incidents

29
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:16,192
This is right has any time that's like more than like

30
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:18,240
50-minute wait I have

31
00:02:18,752 --> 00:02:19,264
No time for

32
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,800
So 15 minutes

33
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:25,920
Probably cuz if I want to I don't know

34
00:02:26,176 --> 00:02:30,016
Some takeout place I hadn't called ahead if I just show up and

35
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:31,552
Disorder

36
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:33,088
Still might take 10 minutes

37
00:02:33,344 --> 00:02:34,624
To make my food and give it

38
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:37,952
Not too bad the way

39
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:38,976
I would wait

40
00:02:39,232 --> 00:02:39,744
An hour though that's

41
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:42,048
Half an hour get out of here

42
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:43,840
I think I've only ever weighed

43
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:44,864
The Pearl Restaurant

44
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:48,448
Like that's the longest I've ever

45
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:49,984
And that's because I wasn't

46
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:54,080
Control you know it was like a family gathering at once

47
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:55,104
3 people are like

48
00:02:57,408 --> 00:02:58,944
I don't like food that much

49
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,992
A restaurant

50
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:01,760
Absolutely

51
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:05,600
Inline 4 movie

52
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:10,208
I was like

53
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:13,792
17

54
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:17,888
Can I just look at the people waiting.

55
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:22,496
Pittsburgh

56
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:29,408
Columbia Missouri when I was like right headlights with autonomy over decisions

57
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:32,736
I am like not a ton of bands come to

58
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:34,528
To Columbia so

59
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:37,600
Waiting for tickets ever that huge

60
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:38,880
Sing for me

61
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:39,648
City either

62
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:41,952
I bet it could have been if I had like more obscure

63
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:45,536
No I don't know I don't I don't

64
00:03:47,584 --> 00:03:48,864
Not not too much

65
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:55,520
Rather get tag

66
00:03:55,776 --> 00:04:01,920
I'll call you like a hundred percent

67
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:08,320
Character or the bond

68
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:13,440
That would be fantastic

69
00:04:16,512 --> 00:04:18,815
Lutheranism Pakistan match by waiting in line

70
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:20,863
But I do know plenty about Alex Jones

71
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:27,775
The fun sort of present day

72
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:28,799
Episode to go over but

73
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:29,823
Before we get to that

74
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:32,895
Go to sign up

75
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:33,663
Restarting the show

Hey I like with these guys.

101
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:04,799
The sports show on the website

102
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:06,335
Horchow

103
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:09,663
We got a most

104
00:06:10,175 --> 00:06:10,687
Present

105
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:11,455
Today

106
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:12,479
Situation going on

107
00:06:12,735 --> 00:06:17,343
Because I was looking well you know what be great

108
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:19,647
Everyone seems to be interested in

109
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:23,999
They're coming out about Alex losing an appeal

110
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:25,279
Sandy Hook lawsuit

111
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:27,327
Seeing as we've

112
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:33,727
Come to the point in the 2013 investigation where it looks like things are going bad for Alex's coverage of Sandy Hook

113
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:36,543
You know we got a break in the case

114
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:39,615
In the present day

115
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:43,455
Probably wants to know what we think about that

116
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:45,759
Cuz response to breaking

117
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:49,343
And so I thought all right September 4th

118
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:51,135
So we're going over September 5th

119
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:55,743
Today although I lost my patience for this episode

120
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:56,767
And I think

121
00:06:57,023 --> 00:06:59,327
You might be able to figure out why

122
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:12,127
Okay

123
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:13,663
Lost lawsuits and defensive

124
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:14,431
America and free

125
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:15,199
Free speech

126
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:17,247
Absolutely and we got a little bit of

127
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:19,807
Got plenty of bars

128
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:24,927
The show is so Barnes heavy present

129
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:27,999
How you can have a

130
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:30,815
Show that's entirely about your own legal trouble

131
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:34,399
In between in between calling for

132
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:35,679
Inviolate over

133
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:38,239
Overthrow

134
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:39,519
Just your own legal issues

135
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:45,919
Can you imagine if I can understand Cooper's all the sudden is just doing news about it so he's getting sued

136
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:52,319
Find a conceptual getting practice it's not a good show

137
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:53,855
The idea of it makes me laugh

138
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:59,999
Probably not going to work out

139
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:04,095
So talk about these legal developments

140
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:09,215
And they talked about there at the end of that clip

141
00:08:09,471 --> 00:08:10,239
Vesuvius associated

142
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:13,567
And media organizations because

143
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:18,943
He believes that the Associated Press said that he wrote that book no one died at Sandy Hook

144
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:21,759
A lawsuit about that book

145
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:23,551
However as we discussed

146
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:24,575
In the past

147
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:25,343
This is

148
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:30,207
Different website

149
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:36,607
Can some content from an AP article article was not on that other website

150
00:08:36,863 --> 00:08:38,143
Distributed

151
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:44,287
Thrown out of court like there's no way

152
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:48,383

How to make it through the summer of Rage

159
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:12,959

160
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:17,311

But he's got

162
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:19,871

How close is he getting to like Soma

Does it cross over into like he's just doing

00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:59,359
But either way I just

193
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:05,503
Effective my outburst

194
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:08,575
Ridiculous

195
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:11,903
So Alex

196
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:15,231
Just Alex saying that he has

197
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:20,095
20 hour live a Day broadcast format

198
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:25,727
I cut that color cuz it just the same thing as the lawsuits are coming

199
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:27,775
She had over and over and over again

200
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:29,055
Liking you

201
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:33,663
Rowan a couple of new novel little pieces of bigotry here and there

202
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:34,943
Some weird defense

203
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:35,967
Open Trump.

204
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:40,575
And the rest of it is all just like it, don't worry about it down the road

205
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:45,951
We get to this point

206
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:47,231
Sentence of Alexei saying that like

207
00:12:48,767 --> 00:12:49,791
He's indicating some

208
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:52,095
Desire is to get away from

209
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:53,887
But not

210
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:54,911
What it is

211
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:57,215
After the El Paso and Dayton shooting

212
00:12:57,471 --> 00:12:58,239
Trump came out

213
00:12:58,495 --> 00:13:00,799
Besides these red flag laws

214
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:03,871
Baby there's some

215
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:06,687
So you know his narrative on that way

216
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:09,759
That was the rope-a-dope globalist

217
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:11,295
The revealed themselves men

218
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:12,319
Give them nothing

219
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:15,903
And now it appears that that is not true

220
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:21,279
Actually be interested

221
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:23,839
And now these red flag type laws

222
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:26,399
And the Alex is saying that he will call for a

223
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:28,703
Chuck Liddell net worth

224
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:34,847
Because there's a bigger issue

225
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:36,639
Is that down with the 5th

226
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:37,407
In the first place

227
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:38,943
Course

228
00:13:45,087 --> 00:13:49,183
Alright

229
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:51,743
You're never going to believe the truth

230
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:55,583
Okay

231
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:59,167
I made it depends on what you mean by Sandy Hook lost

232
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:02,751
Have you ever seen

233
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:07,871
You're wrong you haven't anything anything anything that's obviously true

234
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,687
You are an idiot for thinking

235
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:12,735
How do you know anything exists

236
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:23,487
Pictures of the most solipsistic lawyer that I can exist

Aperitif

238
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:33,215
It is a

239
00:14:33,471 --> 00:14:34,751
Hazardous thing we are

240
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:36,287
Professionals and even then

241
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:37,823
It's dangerous to go

242
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:41,151
Commercial break

243
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:42,687
Gets into talking about the

Worcestershire about Sandy Hook

245
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:53,439

First things first Washington Post article that he's talking about is not buried

253
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:55,391
It's literally as easy to find as any other articles posted on their website

254
00:15:55,647 --> 00:16:01,279
Just look for it

255
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:02,303
The media won't cover it

256
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:06,655
Washington Post article

257
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:10,751
Supreme Court that has nothing to do with Alex's Maine

258
00:16:11,007 --> 00:16:11,519
In court case

259
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:17,919
Specifically about the sanctions he was hit with after he drunkenly put out a million-dollar bounty on the opposing counsel

260
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:22,271
After which he was found to have

261
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:26,879
Unknowingly sent that email containing oligo pornography is part of his discovery

262
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:29,183
From the article

263
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:31,231
Supreme Court agreed to hear it

264
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:33,279
Appeal of a lower Court's decision

Broadcaster Alex Jones

266
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:36,863
From later in the article

267
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:39,423
Last month a judge in Connecticut

268
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:43,519
She said his legal team failed to produce several documents

269
00:16:43,775 --> 00:16:44,799
Despite repeated orders

270
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:49,663
And she decried what you described as a 20-minute deliberate tirade and harassment and

271
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:50,431
Intimidation

272
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:51,967
On Jones's broadcast

273
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:54,015
About about the lawsuit in one

274
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:55,039
Attorney

275
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:58,111
Alex's lawyer Zaid number of complaints about this

276
00:16:58,367 --> 00:17:02,719
I was largely boil down to claim that our sanctions were a violation of Alex's free-speech right

277
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:08,607
This is all good and well but from everything is been publicly available it doesn't appear this Connecticut

278
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:09,631
Supreme Court appeal

279
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:10,399
Concluded yet

280
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:14,751
All the headlines

281
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:16,031
Better coming out

282
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:17,823
It certainly is no indication

283
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:20,639
Or bearing on the idea that the larger case

284
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:23,711
Has anything to do with

285
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:26,783
Or that he's being unfairly treated in that

286
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:27,807
Write this is

287
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:29,855
Narrowly about the sanction

288
00:17:30,623 --> 00:17:31,135
That the

289
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:31,903
Anthony

290
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:35,231
The conversation is I understand it is about whether or not

291
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:37,023
Sanction Alex or something

292
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:38,047
Utah's out-of-court

293
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:40,863
With the question

294
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:44,191
Does his out-of-court behavior in as much as

295
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:48,799
Cuz he's threatening and trying to intimidate the opposing counsel right I rather

296
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:49,823
The court proceeding

297
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:56,223
I'm at 5 agree but I'm not a lawyer and I don't know

298
00:17:56,735 --> 00:18:01,087
I don't know how it works with in a courtroom so I understand why someone would want to

299
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:07,743
Talk it out but this isn't the Wild West

300
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:09,535
Balloon he threatened to kill my lawyer

301
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:13,631
That's a completely different situation

302
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:15,423
The reason for this

303
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:17,215
Can I get Supreme Court

304
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:20,287
To hear it even if they didn't agree with Alakazam

305
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:23,871
It means nothing that they agreed to hear it other than like

306
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:25,663
That's kind of a novel question

307
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:28,991
What is Ruby arguments are

308
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:31,807
Is it to the Supreme Court

309
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:33,087
To deal with it Everett

310
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:39,487
Like the Connecticut Supreme Court step over here

311
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:44,863
Are there more like okay fine

312
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:47,935
The current headlines were seeing involved the defamation lawsuit he's faced

313
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:51,007
The Texas case was filed

314
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:55,615
The father of a six-year-old child who was killed at Sandy Hook

315
00:18:56,383 --> 00:18:59,199
Advocates that got going outside to have the case dismissed

316
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:00,479
Twitch did not work

317
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:06,623
Even try to appeal the decision to not dismiss the case and the new stories popping up now we're all related to the Texas Court of a

318
00:19:06,879 --> 00:19:09,183
Determining that the case be dismissed

319
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:11,487
And Alex has to pay all the legal fees

320
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:13,535
By the other side during the appeal

321
00:19:14,047 --> 00:19:18,143
Fiesta produce all the internal documents and emails in that Discovery process

322
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:19,679
Which had been refusing

323
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:20,447
Provide

324
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:26,847
All in all what I see here is an intentional strategy being employed by Alex and his legal team of stalling inside tracking

325
00:19:27,615 --> 00:19:31,967
He doesn't want to see the inside of courtroom actually having to be under oath and talking about this stuff

326
00:19:32,223 --> 00:19:33,247
Cuz he knows he f***** up

327
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:37,599
Courts are really bad places work on man but the legal system is also place

328
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:39,647
Where other cons can be run

329
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:43,231
So instead of the actual case

330
00:19:43,743 --> 00:19:44,767
Houston

331
00:19:45,279 --> 00:19:51,167
You refused to hand over required Documents To The Judge

332
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:56,287
And before you know what you're fighting a large the unrelated battle over whether or not you should give the lawyers or email

333
00:19:56,799 --> 00:20:00,895
Gone forever

334
00:20:01,151 --> 00:20:07,295
You can run around pretending that the whole cases of champagne if you lose that little side

335
00:20:07,551 --> 00:20:08,575
Alex dating this Texas case

336
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:12,159
You end up having a bunch of Articles written about how you lost this

337
00:20:12,415 --> 00:20:13,439
And then you can

338
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:17,791
Get on your Shelby like the media signal off the case they're all f****** Liars

339
00:20:18,047 --> 00:20:20,607
It's a win-win and prolonged

340
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:24,959
Reckoning when you're actually in court under up

341
00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:27,263
And as far as the Costco like what is it

342
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:28,031
10 G

343
00:20:28,287 --> 00:20:29,055
And for the cost of a

344
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:32,383
Plaintiffs lawyers on that

345
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:33,919
It slower

346
00:20:34,175 --> 00:20:37,759
It's not Ritz kind of a negligible cost whenever you already have a large

347
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:41,855
He's going yeah how much is a

348
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:45,183
Bravado I don't know but I would assume that

349
00:20:45,695 --> 00:20:48,767
If you're already in if you're in for a penny in for a pound

350
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:51,071
Analisa

351
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:53,375
If your main court case

352
00:20:53,631 --> 00:20:54,143
Keeps going

353
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:55,679
Penalties

354
00:20:55,935 --> 00:20:56,447
These are

355
00:20:56,703 --> 00:20:57,727
Millions of dollars

356
00:20:58,239 --> 00:20:58,751
Which

357
00:21:01,311 --> 00:21:01,823
Very high

358
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:03,871
The very least possible

359
00:21:04,127 --> 00:21:07,455
Or whatever to put day off

360
00:21:07,711 --> 00:21:08,735
Another 6 months

361
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:15,391
To make sure that

362
00:21:15,647 --> 00:21:16,672
Maybe that'll help

363
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:20,768
The blow would spend all of my money

364
00:21:21,024 --> 00:21:23,840
Pushing the case back for the rest of my life rather than

365
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:24,608
Just losing

366
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:25,376
Still have to go

367
00:21:25,888 --> 00:21:26,400
All the Paul bye-bye

368
00:21:29,216 --> 00:21:35,360
Behavior is absolutely the behavior someone who really really doesn't want

369
00:21:35,616 --> 00:21:36,384
Fixing to come out

370
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:41,760
Really I don't know what that thing is something about this case exposes

371
00:21:42,528 --> 00:21:48,672
Something about the source of his money or some editorial decisions are made at info

372
00:21:49,696 --> 00:21:50,464
Either these things

373
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:51,488
Pretty much

374
00:21:52,512 --> 00:21:53,280
Incredibly Jermaine

375
00:21:53,536 --> 00:21:54,560
Sandy Hook lawsuit

376
00:21:54,816 --> 00:21:56,608
So I could obviously see Alex

377
00:21:56,864 --> 00:21:58,656
My crazy to stop the discovery process

378
00:21:58,912 --> 00:21:59,680
Anyway you can

379
00:22:00,192 --> 00:22:02,752
It turns out that his only real strategy to kind of just

380
00:22:03,008 --> 00:22:04,032
The pro temper tantrum

381
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:06,848
Blow up the process

382
00:22:07,616 --> 00:22:09,408
Which can buy you a little time

383
00:22:09,664 --> 00:22:10,176
6 months

384
00:22:10,432 --> 00:22:11,200
In the case of this Texas

385
00:22:11,712 --> 00:22:13,248
It's not going to work in the end

386
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:16,320
He's just delaying the inevitable and that inevitability is

387
00:22:16,576 --> 00:22:19,648
Is that whatever he doesn't want people to know is going to

388
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:20,416
To come out

389
00:22:20,928 --> 00:22:26,048
And how he's pretty regularly being forced to pay plaintiff's legal fees

390
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:27,840
Every reason to

391
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:29,632
Suspect that these cases proceed

392
00:22:29,888 --> 00:22:30,912
You going to be bankrupt

393
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:37,568
If you thought the other half a chance to win on the merits you'd be doing all this weaselly ship to stall the case

394
00:22:38,848 --> 00:22:39,360
You feel like it

395
00:22:40,896 --> 00:22:41,664
Hail Mary attempt

396
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:43,712
To avoid looking easily be his

397
00:22:43,968 --> 00:22:46,528
Conduit is not just from a public humiliation

398
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:47,808
Sandpoint at least

399
00:22:48,064 --> 00:22:48,832
12 a possible

400
00:22:49,088 --> 00:22:49,856
We going broke

401
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:53,440
I can't get away from

402
00:22:53,696 --> 00:22:55,232
Not matching

403
00:22:55,488 --> 00:22:56,512
Someone who wants

404
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:01,120
Like someone who wants to prove themselves innocent wouldn't play the

405
00:23:01,376 --> 00:23:01,888
These sorts of games

406
00:23:02,144 --> 00:23:08,288
These are the games that are played by people who need to not go to court

407
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:10,080
This is the corporate

408
00:23:10,336 --> 00:23:11,104
Like this is like

409
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:11,872
Equifax

410
00:23:12,128 --> 00:23:16,224
Accent s*** like that they will throw off any side the billion-dollar company

411
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:19,552
Is like Costas Costas what do everything we can and then

412
00:23:19,808 --> 00:23:21,088
You always read the story

413
00:23:21,856 --> 00:23:25,184
After 10 years of Appeals

414
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,720
Equifax finally agrees to

415
00:23:26,976 --> 00:23:28,000
Everybody

416
00:23:28,512 --> 00:23:31,328
Nothing we have going to have to do any

417
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:37,216
That's one of the downside says the fairness of the legal system are considered

418
00:23:37,728 --> 00:23:39,520
So Alex that I don't

419
00:23:42,592 --> 00:23:43,616
B

420
00:23:44,128 --> 00:23:45,408
You know I'll tip my hat to him

421
00:23:45,664 --> 00:23:46,688
Because he claimed

422
00:23:46,944 --> 00:23:50,528
But he's not seeking money from the Sandy Hook parents

423
00:23:50,784 --> 00:23:52,576
David lawsuit

424
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:53,600
Kind of contradicted

425
00:24:08,704 --> 00:24:14,848
Hundred-thousand-dollar

426
00:24:15,104 --> 00:24:16,128
And that's not true

427
00:24:22,784 --> 00:24:24,320
Okay

428
00:24:24,576 --> 00:24:26,368
Still the article is true

429
00:24:26,624 --> 00:24:29,440
Okay so it's not true.

430
00:24:29,696 --> 00:24:30,976
Okay

431
00:24:31,488 --> 00:24:32,000
Alright

432
00:24:32,256 --> 00:24:34,304
Okay whatever

433
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:36,096
When the article was written

434
00:24:36,352 --> 00:24:38,144
Not Trail okay

435
00:24:38,656 --> 00:24:40,192
That day after the articles

436
00:24:40,704 --> 00:24:42,240
Totally

437
00:24:42,496 --> 00:24:45,312
Sounds good

438
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:46,336
Hooray

439
00:24:46,848 --> 00:24:50,688
So I just tried to deny

440
00:24:50,944 --> 00:24:51,968
Escape the reality is

441
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:52,736
Situation

442
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:55,552
I'm not going to trial

443
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,160
Obviously

444
00:25:04,256 --> 00:25:06,304
This is amazing

445
00:25:08,864 --> 00:25:10,912
All of them

446
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:19,872
It's

447
00:25:20,384 --> 00:25:25,504
It's so you know it's all just down to what you define like you're able to

448
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,808
Things like this

449
00:25:28,064 --> 00:25:34,208
The declining of the appeal was based on a jurisdictional issue and they wasn't.

450
00:25:34,464 --> 00:25:36,768
It's of the case or whatever

451
00:25:37,024 --> 00:25:39,840
You can split hairs like that if you want to but

452
00:25:40,352 --> 00:25:45,216
It's not if you look at the larger picture of the case as it

453
00:25:45,472 --> 00:25:46,752
It's going this is not a posit

454
00:25:47,008 --> 00:25:47,520
For Alex

455
00:25:47,776 --> 00:25:48,544
One more loss

456
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,080
One more battle lost

457
00:25:50,336 --> 00:25:54,176
In a long ongoing War

458
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:58,528
To appeal the non dismissal of the case

459
00:25:58,784 --> 00:26:00,576
If the end result of that is

460
00:26:01,088 --> 00:26:03,904
Know whatever the reason for the know is

461
00:26:04,416 --> 00:26:05,184
It's still a no

462
00:26:05,952 --> 00:26:07,744
You did not get the outcome you thought

463
00:26:08,256 --> 00:26:09,536
So I look at that is

464
00:26:11,328 --> 00:26:16,448
Comes on and they talk a whole lot of bulshit about

465
00:26:16,704 --> 00:26:17,216
And Free Speech

466
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:18,752
Basquiat

467
00:26:21,312 --> 00:26:22,848
If allowed to proceed

468
00:26:23,104 --> 00:26:24,896
If it is even allowed to pursue

469
00:26:25,408 --> 00:26:25,920
Yes

470
00:26:26,176 --> 00:26:26,688
And

471
00:26:26,944 --> 00:26:27,712
Not only that

472
00:26:27,968 --> 00:26:30,016
That is also the goal of the people Sue

473
00:26:31,296 --> 00:26:33,600
Zip some of the legal theories being pursued

474
00:26:33,856 --> 00:26:34,880
Are permitted

475
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:35,904
Or allowed

476
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:40,000
Then press will no longer be free

477
00:26:40,256 --> 00:26:44,864
So these cases will establish the true scope of the First Amendment

478
00:26:46,144 --> 00:26:46,656
Fundamental

479
00:26:46,912 --> 00:26:48,448
First Amendment cases in the country

480
00:26:48,704 --> 00:26:50,240
To come

481
00:26:52,288 --> 00:26:54,080
Block Rockin Beats

Geopolitical issues geopolitical issues with Robert f****** Barnes

484
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:20,448
This guy has some really good

485
00:27:21,216 --> 00:27:22,240
I think he's

486
00:27:22,496 --> 00:27:24,288
Great

487
00:27:24,544 --> 00:27:30,688
Lovely nose the nitty-gritty details what's going on over there in Kashmir

488
00:27:30,944 --> 00:27:31,712
Call up Barnes

489
00:27:32,224 --> 00:27:35,296
And he'll tell you absolutely

490
00:27:37,344 --> 00:27:38,368
It's take us out to break

491
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:41,952
Customer shal

492
00:27:42,208 --> 00:27:42,720
That I thought was a

493
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:50,144
Thomas Jefferson's years ago

494
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:56,544
Close to ground close to reality

495
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:03,712
I think

496
00:28:03,968 --> 00:28:10,112
I don't know that to be Thomas Jefferson quote I can't find it in anything I think he's reference suggest the

497
00:28:10,368 --> 00:28:10,880
Charlton Heston

498
00:28:11,136 --> 00:28:17,280
Speech that we talked about the recent episode

499
00:28:17,536 --> 00:28:19,584
Is just go to jail

500
00:28:20,096 --> 00:28:23,168
It's not good

501
00:28:23,424 --> 00:28:24,960
Never seen anybody bungalow

502
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,776
Supposed

Comical

504
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:30,592
Tremendous

505
00:28:30,848 --> 00:28:31,872
So they come back

506
00:28:32,128 --> 00:28:34,176
And finish up Barnes

507
00:28:34,432 --> 00:28:35,968
Most of it is just a flexion

508
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,040
You know after all that

509
00:28:40,064 --> 00:28:40,576
Barnes

510
00:28:40,832 --> 00:28:42,368
Gives a little bit of a plug

511
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:47,744
For something that I've been a little bit aware of for a bit now cuz of listen to these episodes

512
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,560
But it's becoming more public about

513
00:28:50,816 --> 00:28:53,632
Deserves a little bit

514
00:28:53,888 --> 00:28:55,680
It's lukewarm for Sono

515
00:28:55,936 --> 00:28:56,448

We are going to be supporting

524

That works

525
00:29:34,592 --> 00:29:36,384
Exactly

526
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:38,944
Lawyers to bring great cases to equalize the equation

527
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,504
Because the left has been effectively monopolized

528
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,040
Interest law in this country

529
00:29:43,552 --> 00:29:49,696
So do the left has taken over the ACLU entirely too

530
00:29:49,952 --> 00:29:51,488
Organization

531
00:29:51,744 --> 00:29:54,048

ACLU

533

Oh boy

534
00:30:00,192 --> 00:30:00,704
So Jordan

535
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:01,728
Yeah

536
00:30:01,984 --> 00:30:07,360
Robert Barnes dangerous part of his path as a scam artist

537
00:30:07,616 --> 00:30:10,688
It's all good well to manipulate Alex and feast on his court Express

538
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,992
It's almost amusing to watch Howie's

539
00:30:13,248 --> 00:30:19,136
Completely insinuated himself into the actual programming at Infowars Alex now refers to him as expert

540
00:30:19,392 --> 00:30:20,928
Things like international relations

541
00:30:21,184 --> 00:30:24,768
It's understandable to up on other scams

542
00:30:25,024 --> 00:30:25,536
Flash react

543
00:30:25,792 --> 00:30:27,584
Missionary Outlets like the Rubin report

544
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:28,864
And doing interviews with

545
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:29,632
Stefan molyneux

546
00:30:30,144 --> 00:30:33,472
It is so predictable territory

547
00:30:33,984 --> 00:30:34,496
Shein

548
00:30:35,008 --> 00:30:35,520
However

549
00:30:35,776 --> 00:30:37,312
Now he's in barking on a project

550
00:30:37,568 --> 00:30:40,128
That no matter how it shakes out is a really bad song

551
00:30:41,408 --> 00:30:42,432
Robert Barnes has launched

552
00:30:42,688 --> 00:30:46,016
The free America Law Center which is uses the antidote

553
00:30:46,272 --> 00:30:48,576
Liberal Stranglehold over the world of law

554
00:30:48,832 --> 00:30:52,160
Splc in ACLU weirdest shields for the Democrat Party

555
00:30:52,672 --> 00:30:56,256
So that the right-wing needs their own version of these organizations in order to

556
00:30:56,512 --> 00:30:57,280
To even the playing

557
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:00,864
Yep got it would be

558
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:01,632
So much better

559
00:31:02,656 --> 00:31:03,680
Free America internet

560
00:31:03,936 --> 00:31:04,448
National RC

561
00:31:04,704 --> 00:31:06,496
Something like that and just himself

562
00:31:07,264 --> 00:31:08,288
I be great

563
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:14,944
So it is justifying the need for this organization has cases for liberals nowadays

564
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,224
Which is patently false

565
00:31:16,992 --> 00:31:23,136
The ACLU was a non political entity that does so much goddamn work for people's rights it would take what's left of Barnes his breath away

566
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:24,928
The fair look

567
00:31:25,696 --> 00:31:28,512
Here is some of the cases the ACLU was involved in right now

568
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:30,816
James Aaron McKinney was sentenced

569
00:31:31,072 --> 00:31:33,888
The death for a murder but it is trial the judge didn't take

570
00:31:34,144 --> 00:31:36,192
Consideration evidence related to his post-traumatic

571
00:31:36,448 --> 00:31:36,960
Stress disorder

572
00:31:37,216 --> 00:31:39,520
Which could have been seen as a mitigating circumstance

573
00:31:39,776 --> 00:31:41,056
The terms of applying Capital punish

574
00:31:41,824 --> 00:31:44,640
That case has nothing to do with liberals or conservatives

575
00:31:44,896 --> 00:31:46,432
But the rights of a human being

576
00:31:46,688 --> 00:31:50,016
Sounds like the left-wing, nonsense to me damn probably

577
00:31:50,528 --> 00:31:53,600
Also they're defending

578
00:31:54,368 --> 00:31:55,648
Based on the reasoning

579
00:31:55,904 --> 00:31:58,720
Comes to life without parole as a juvenile

580
00:31:59,232 --> 00:32:00,512
Does he deserve a Newsstand

581
00:32:01,024 --> 00:32:06,912
Should be ruling be retroactive to minors were sentenced to life without parole prior to the Montgomery versus

582
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:08,192
Court decision

583
00:32:08,448 --> 00:32:09,728
Make that an appropriate

584
00:32:10,496 --> 00:32:11,520
This has nothing to do with Paula

585
00:32:12,032 --> 00:32:13,312
The ACLU was on the front lines

586
00:32:13,568 --> 00:32:14,080
The stuff like that

587
00:32:14,592 --> 00:32:15,616
Compassion is left-wing

588
00:32:16,384 --> 00:32:22,528
I guess for pulling off a f****** sniper attack

589
00:32:22,784 --> 00:32:24,576
I still recognize that maybe his scent

590
00:32:24,832 --> 00:32:26,624
I'm saying is invalid now because of

591
00:32:28,928 --> 00:32:31,232
These are just a couple of cases they're currently involved in that

592
00:32:31,488 --> 00:32:34,304
V possibly unpopular Santa

593
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:35,840
Defend individual rights

594
00:32:36,352 --> 00:32:37,888
And they're plenty more examples

595
00:32:38,144 --> 00:32:39,680
Of a political s*** in the work they do

596
00:32:40,448 --> 00:32:42,496
They still use the American civil liberties

597
00:32:43,008 --> 00:32:48,384
Here is the people like Alex and Barnes have a very specific definition of civil liberties

598
00:32:49,664 --> 00:32:51,200
The ACLU believes the definition

599
00:32:51,456 --> 00:32:55,040
Includes taking on cases where Refugee Rights are being trampled on where lgbtq

600
00:32:55,296 --> 00:33:01,440
Thank you folks rights are being violated where women's rights are violated voting rights are being eroded

601
00:33:01,696 --> 00:33:06,816
His ilk are actively interested in those rights being curtail

602
00:33:07,072 --> 00:33:09,376
Organization

603
00:33:09,632 --> 00:33:10,144
Pacifically exist

604
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:13,728
To defend those rights

605
00:33:13,984 --> 00:33:14,496
Conservatives

606
00:33:15,008 --> 00:33:17,056
Is there definition of conservatives is

607
00:33:17,312 --> 00:33:20,896
Not into respecting the rights of non straight white male

608
00:33:21,152 --> 00:33:22,432
Natural born citizen

609
00:33:22,688 --> 00:33:25,504
Then I guess the ACLU is the enemy of

610
00:33:26,016 --> 00:33:27,040
Conservative

611
00:33:32,928 --> 00:33:34,976
Work outfits

612
00:33:35,744 --> 00:33:38,304
This organization Works to counter the bad things I want to see

613
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:42,144
City in the world

614
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,424
Working everything they might do

615
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:44,704
It's almost reflexive

616
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:50,336
And that's not to say you doesn't deserve some criticism in some places it's not the valid

617
00:33:50,592 --> 00:33:54,432
The type people like Barnes and

618
00:33:54,688 --> 00:33:59,040
Is completely the wrong criticism invalid

619
00:33:59,296 --> 00:34:01,344
It's always a a

620
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:02,368
I can't imagine

621
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:03,392
People

622
00:34:03,648 --> 00:34:04,672
You can be mad

623
00:34:05,952 --> 00:34:06,720
I've been mad at

624
00:34:07,232 --> 00:34:07,744
ACLU

625
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,280
But generally speaking if you

626
00:34:09,536 --> 00:34:11,072
The ACL is a bad organ

627
00:34:13,888 --> 00:34:20,032
There's a lot of Green Valley criticisms you can make a lot of especially internal stuff

628
00:34:21,056 --> 00:34:22,848
Now this earlier this year there's a

629
00:34:23,104 --> 00:34:25,152
Real bad stuff came out of

630
00:34:25,408 --> 00:34:26,176
Internal working condition

631
00:34:28,992 --> 00:34:30,016
Allegation

632
00:34:30,272 --> 00:34:32,576
I think it's very valid to

633
00:34:32,832 --> 00:34:33,856
Be critical of Ozark

634
00:34:34,112 --> 00:34:34,624
Relationship

635
00:34:35,136 --> 00:34:36,416
Not in the blanket

636
00:34:36,672 --> 00:34:38,208
They're run by liberals

637
00:34:38,464 --> 00:34:40,768
To crush us White

638
00:34:41,024 --> 00:34:43,584
That's the mentality

639
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:44,864
Yeah

640
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:45,888
2 organization

641
00:34:46,144 --> 00:34:46,912
And I've always thought that

642
00:34:47,936 --> 00:34:49,472
Are those crazy

643
00:34:49,728 --> 00:34:50,240
Isn't that working

644
00:34:50,496 --> 00:34:51,008
Conditions are

645
00:34:52,544 --> 00:34:54,080
But the main goals

646
00:34:54,336 --> 00:34:55,360
Of the ACLU

647
00:34:56,128 --> 00:34:56,640
Splc

648
00:34:57,152 --> 00:34:58,176
I have always been like

649
00:34:59,456 --> 00:35:01,504
You remember all that stuff in the Constitution

650
00:35:02,272 --> 00:35:04,320
We'd like to apply to every

651
00:35:06,624 --> 00:35:08,416
The goal of Americas

652
00:35:08,672 --> 00:35:10,720
Original goals are but just for like all p

653
00:35:11,744 --> 00:35:13,280
And people

654
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:15,072
Berserk

655
00:35:16,096 --> 00:35:16,608
Or out

656
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:22,240
So my big issue here is with Barnes playing to set up his own counter a course

657
00:35:22,496 --> 00:35:28,384
Splc completely inaccurate portrayal of what either of those groups are or do

658
00:35:29,152 --> 00:35:33,248
Proverbs Barn plan is the group's describing

659
00:35:33,504 --> 00:35:34,016
Already

660
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:39,648
Throughout the ecou as an example there still so many non-political rights Focus

661
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:41,184
Advocacy groups in the United

662
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:47,328
Midstate Plumbing for fucksake in 1998 conservative started their own Americans

663
00:35:47,584 --> 00:35:48,096
Union

664
00:35:48,352 --> 00:35:50,656
Specifically as a response to the ACLU

665
00:35:50,912 --> 00:35:56,800
This is old territory it's been done before and for these reasons you really have to ask yourself why is Barnes

666
00:35:57,056 --> 00:35:57,568
Doing this

667
00:35:57,824 --> 00:35:59,360
Already exist

668
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:03,968
Oh I know I know hold your hold your thoughts

669
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:06,016
One possibility

670
00:36:06,272 --> 00:36:09,088
Maybe one of the more likely possibility is it

671
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:15,744
We've discussed many times that the trend of the right-wing in the scam Community is tended towards lost

672
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:16,512
Suit scam

673
00:36:16,768 --> 00:36:20,608
As their ability to really make much Headway on social media spaces is diminished

674
00:36:20,864 --> 00:36:23,168
And along with that their ability to pull off compelling

675
00:36:23,424 --> 00:36:24,704
Improbable publicity stunts

676
00:36:25,984 --> 00:36:29,312
It could make complete sense of the Barnes knows that the future of right-wing

677
00:36:31,616 --> 00:36:32,384
Impotent threat

678
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:33,664
Text to file a lawsuit

679
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:36,224
We used to raise money for the person issuing

680
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:41,344
We saw Laura Loomer not too long ago

681
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:44,672
Like how long is he been saying is going to sue the Associated Press

682
00:36:44,928 --> 00:36:50,048
Beginning this episode he's always just about to file this lawsuit

683
00:36:50,304 --> 00:36:52,352
And until he does he has the ability to

684
00:36:52,608 --> 00:36:53,120
Teases audio

685
00:36:53,888 --> 00:37:00,032
You all hate the mainstream media and I'm just the guy to fight them for you to give me money I promise the lawsuit is coming any day now

686
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,080
Schroeder's lawsuit

687
00:37:02,848 --> 00:37:07,456
If Barnes is smart that is freedom Law Center does American free America Law Center

688
00:37:07,712 --> 00:37:11,296
I am setting up a corporate Entity 303

689
00:37:11,552 --> 00:37:12,832
Incredible and then take a cut off

690
00:37:13,088 --> 00:37:13,600
The top

691
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:17,696
Which I respect the hustle

692
00:37:17,952 --> 00:37:20,512
As a 501

693
00:37:20,768 --> 00:37:22,304
However Jordan

694
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:24,352
There's a possibility

695
00:37:24,608 --> 00:37:25,376
Far boredness

696
00:37:26,656 --> 00:37:29,728
I'd like to tell you a little story about a man named Kirk David lion

697
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:31,776
Whose footsteps Robert Barnes

698
00:37:32,032 --> 00:37:32,544
Maybe

699
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:33,312
Following

700
00:37:34,336 --> 00:37:35,616
Brooke Lyons grew up in text

701
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:37,152
And according to a bios

702
00:37:37,408 --> 00:37:38,688
From Baylor University

703
00:37:38,944 --> 00:37:42,528
From a young age Lions was confronted with the issue of racial equality

704
00:37:42,784 --> 00:37:45,088
Which was realized the forced integration

705
00:37:45,344 --> 00:37:51,232
Public Schools

706
00:37:51,488 --> 00:37:53,280
If a write-up of your early years include

707
00:37:53,536 --> 00:37:59,680
Beating black people in schools was difficult for Kirk as a child that story is not going to end well

708
00:37:59,936 --> 00:38:02,752
Is it really

709
00:38:03,776 --> 00:38:04,288
Very much

710
00:38:05,824 --> 00:38:06,592
Sleep what they

711
00:38:06,848 --> 00:38:07,360
Was actually

712
00:38:07,616 --> 00:38:12,992
I think it's a diplomatic phrase

713
00:38:13,248 --> 00:38:14,272
Absolutely

714
00:38:14,528 --> 00:38:18,112
University of Houston that started practice

715
00:38:18,368 --> 00:38:18,880
Nothing on his own

716
00:38:19,392 --> 00:38:25,536
The former head of the clan and then head of the Aryan Nation

717
00:38:25,792 --> 00:38:28,352
He was brought at Alliant by Mutual acquaintance

718
00:38:28,864 --> 00:38:31,680
Zendaya

719
00:38:31,936 --> 00:38:32,448
Anyone

720
00:38:32,704 --> 00:38:33,216
Your Council

721
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:39,872
Why does mutual friend with the ground-floor they Louis beam

722
00:38:40,128 --> 00:38:40,640
Legal team

723
00:38:42,688 --> 00:38:48,832
I would imagine it's probably because Lions gave us that old Telltale cool with Nazis vibe

724
00:38:49,088 --> 00:38:50,880
Azu preferred Alabama

725
00:38:54,976 --> 00:38:59,072
Not all this is for Baylor ironically

726
00:38:59,328 --> 00:39:02,144
Came from the Southern Poverty Law Center

727
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,704
Does white people like barns rectum

728
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:09,568
Yes so when being was arrested in 1987 left his

729
00:39:09,824 --> 00:39:10,592
Gets to represent him

730
00:39:11,104 --> 00:39:13,408
In the trial that's known as the Fort Smith

731
00:39:13,664 --> 00:39:14,176
Sedition trial

732
00:39:14,944 --> 00:39:16,992
In that trial 14

733
00:39:17,248 --> 00:39:20,320
As leaders were tried on accusations plan to overthrow the government

734
00:39:21,088 --> 00:39:23,392
Outside of a court of law that's a slam-dunk case

735
00:39:23,904 --> 00:39:28,000
These dudes literally never stop talking about crushing occupied government

736
00:39:28,256 --> 00:39:30,816
They are not very secretive

737
00:39:31,072 --> 00:39:33,376
Hangouts

738
00:39:33,632 --> 00:39:34,144
The courtroom

739
00:39:34,656 --> 00:39:35,936
We are planning

740
00:39:36,192 --> 00:39:36,704
Together

741
00:39:37,472 --> 00:39:38,240
To overthrow the

742
00:39:39,264 --> 00:39:41,312
Right now when they get inside of

743
00:39:41,568 --> 00:39:47,712
The courtroom dad know it seems like

744
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:49,760
Free speech

745
00:39:50,528 --> 00:39:56,672
Dial along with Richard smell of David Lane members of white supremacist groups

746
00:39:56,928 --> 00:39:57,440
Murders

747
00:39:57,696 --> 00:39:58,208
As well as the

748
00:39:58,464 --> 00:39:59,488
The founder of Aryan Nation

749
00:39:59,744 --> 00:40:00,512
Richard Butler

750
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:02,816
A white supremacist named Glenn Miller

751
00:40:03,072 --> 00:40:07,680
Agreed to testify against the other man

752
00:40:07,936 --> 00:40:08,960
Including making bombs

753
00:40:09,472 --> 00:40:12,032
He served three years in prison thanks to his cooperation

754
00:40:13,056 --> 00:40:15,616
In 2014 Glenn Miller carried out two shootings

755
00:40:15,872 --> 00:40:19,200
The Jewish Community Center of Greater Kansas City and Village Shalom

756
00:40:19,456 --> 00:40:20,992
The second of which is a retirement home

757
00:40:21,504 --> 00:40:22,528
He killed three people

758
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:25,856
Ironically since his attack was clearly based on his aunt

759
00:40:26,112 --> 00:40:26,624
Ism

760
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:28,416
None of the people he killed were Jewish

761
00:40:28,928 --> 00:40:32,512
At the community center he killed a fourteen-year-old and his grandfather who were just there visiting

762
00:40:32,768 --> 00:40:35,072
Heather retirement homie killed an occupational therapist

763
00:40:35,328 --> 00:40:36,608
A Christian

764
00:40:37,376 --> 00:40:40,960
Anyway that's the legacy of one of these guys now

765
00:40:41,216 --> 00:40:41,984
Great good people

766
00:40:43,264 --> 00:40:45,056
Prison

767
00:40:45,312 --> 00:40:49,152
Three years but agreed to testify in the Fort Smith sedition trials we got a letter sent

768
00:40:49,664 --> 00:40:50,944
Unfortunately his assistant

769
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:51,968
The case was pointless

770
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:57,600
All the defendants were acquitted due to lack of evidence which is exactly

771
00:40:58,368 --> 00:41:00,160
It's insanely hard to prove it

772
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:03,232
Conspiracy particularly want to actually overthrow the government

773
00:41:03,488 --> 00:41:05,024
When it's perfectly acceptable as a DE

774
00:41:05,536 --> 00:41:09,376
To say that your constant screaming but other government has been taken over by malevolent demon

775
00:41:09,632 --> 00:41:11,168
Is this criticism of the state

776
00:41:11,424 --> 00:41:11,936
It's protected

777
00:41:13,728 --> 00:41:19,104
So anyway all these dudes walked her clients became a big f****** deal in the world

778
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:19,872
Supremacy

779
00:41:20,384 --> 00:41:22,944
He was the lawyer that saved all their leaders

780
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:23,712
From jail time

781
00:41:23,968 --> 00:41:27,808
And is Lewis being put it quote Delta huge blow to the dog

782
00:41:28,064 --> 00:41:30,880
Those f****** things where you're like

783
00:41:31,392 --> 00:41:33,696
I get it and I know I shouldn't

784
00:41:35,232 --> 00:41:38,304
But everybody knows that Colin Kaepernick

785
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:41,632
Should be in the f****** NFL and it's a goddamn conspiracy

786
00:41:42,912 --> 00:41:47,264
How did the NFL but you go into courtroom and they're like well you can't prove that it's like that

787
00:41:52,384 --> 00:41:58,527
That's the that's the difference between what you can

788
00:42:01,343 --> 00:42:02,879
It's one thing for a lawyer to

789
00:42:03,135 --> 00:42:03,903
To defend white supremacy

790
00:42:04,159 --> 00:42:04,671
Justin Aziz

791
00:42:04,927 --> 00:42:09,791
As we discussed

792
00:42:10,047 --> 00:42:12,863
In court but it doesn't prove that

793
00:42:13,631 --> 00:42:16,703
Just the fact that Lions decided to put his previous career on hold

794
00:42:16,959 --> 00:42:19,007
To defeat at St Louis

795
00:42:19,263 --> 00:42:21,311
Doesn't mean that he's a client's menorah.

796
00:42:21,567 --> 00:42:22,079
Absolutely

797
00:42:22,591 --> 00:42:26,431
And a Nazi does prove that.

798
00:42:26,687 --> 00:42:31,295
Does help there is not a dearth of evidence

799
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:35,647
He marched with the Klan and Nazis in 1989 in Tennessee

800
00:42:36,159 --> 00:42:37,951
He was a member of the National Alliance

801
00:42:38,207 --> 00:42:40,255
What's a group run by William Luther pierce the author of The

802
00:42:40,511 --> 00:42:41,279
The Turner Diaries

803
00:42:41,535 --> 00:42:47,679
He was definitely definitely a member of these groups as proven by correspondence is written by Piers identifying

804
00:42:47,935 --> 00:42:49,471
The lawyer within their ranks

805
00:42:49,727 --> 00:42:50,239
Yeah

806
00:42:50,495 --> 00:42:53,311
To give you some idea how deep in the mix Lions was

807
00:42:53,567 --> 00:42:55,103
When you got married in 1990

808
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:57,151
The ceremony took place at the Aryan Nation

809
00:42:57,407 --> 00:42:57,919
Compound

810
00:42:58,175 --> 00:42:59,967
Wow his bride had two brothers

811
00:43:00,479 --> 00:43:01,247
One was in prison

812
00:43:01,503 --> 00:43:06,879
Because he was a member of the order and was involved with some of their murders member of the f****** order

813
00:43:07,135 --> 00:43:10,207
Brother was

814
00:43:10,719 --> 00:43:11,487
Right right

815
00:43:11,743 --> 00:43:14,559
Richard Butler so he was he was marrying royalty

816
00:43:14,815 --> 00:43:18,911
Richard Butler the founder of the Aryan Nation

817
00:43:19,167 --> 00:43:23,519
Charges

818
00:43:23,775 --> 00:43:24,287
The ceremony

819
00:43:24,543 --> 00:43:27,871
Were they all wearing white

820
00:43:31,967 --> 00:43:36,063
In 1988 Lions was invited to give a speech of Aryan Nations World Congress

821
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:41,439
Swear you discussed ideas about setting up a foundation where you could operate like the FPL

822
00:43:41,695 --> 00:43:44,255
L

823
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:47,583
Leaders who he represented

824
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:49,887
People who he thought were just Patriots

825
00:43:50,143 --> 00:43:50,655
Dissident

826
00:43:51,167 --> 00:43:51,935
In quotes

827
00:43:52,447 --> 00:43:53,215
District shape

828
00:43:53,471 --> 00:43:54,239
Uniformity Patriots

829
00:43:54,495 --> 00:43:55,263
Defense Foundation

830
00:43:55,775 --> 00:43:57,311
In soliciting donations

831
00:43:57,567 --> 00:43:58,335
Thanks for the PDF

832
00:43:58,591 --> 00:44:02,431
William Luther Pierce told his followers in a newsletter quote

833
00:44:02,687 --> 00:44:08,831
Houston member clients and attorney has organized the Patriots defense Foundation as a start towards a June for our

834
00:44:09,087 --> 00:44:10,623
People what the Jews have done to RN

835
00:44:11,903 --> 00:44:12,927
Before our enemies

836
00:44:13,439 --> 00:44:16,255
That sure seems like a conspiracy to overthrow the government

837
00:44:16,511 --> 00:44:17,279
I'm just

838
00:44:17,791 --> 00:44:20,351
The PDF would change its name in 1991

839
00:44:20,607 --> 00:44:22,143
Would henceforth be known as cause

840
00:44:22,655 --> 00:44:25,983
Which stands for Canada Australia Us South Africa in Europe

841
00:44:26,239 --> 00:44:29,055
Reflecting the areas in the world were white people were being attacked

842
00:44:29,311 --> 00:44:34,687
Build themselves as quote America's only pro-white Law Firm

843
00:44:35,199 --> 00:44:36,991
I put out ads and all the places you would have

844
00:44:37,503 --> 00:44:38,271
Soldier of Fortune

845
00:44:39,039 --> 00:44:41,087
Stormfront all the of the

846
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:42,111
Normal

847
00:44:42,367 --> 00:44:46,463
Yeah we're not

848
00:44:47,231 --> 00:44:53,375
Secondary Guitar Pro

849
00:44:55,935 --> 00:44:59,263
From there I started recording all the right with monsters

850
00:44:59,519 --> 00:45:00,543
He could take on his client

851
00:45:00,799 --> 00:45:05,151
Holocaust deniers the middle of Alyssa guys who killed someone because they didn't like

852
00:45:05,919 --> 00:45:11,551
Tempe of the Rocky Mountain Rendezvous the meeting held by Christian identity

853
00:45:11,807 --> 00:45:14,879
Repeaters with brought together all the luminaries in the world of white bigot

854
00:45:15,647 --> 00:45:19,743
He was there with Larry Pratt head of gun owners for America and early Alex Jones

855
00:45:19,999 --> 00:45:20,511
Sponsor

856
00:45:21,023 --> 00:45:22,303
Pratt ended up having to resign

857
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:23,071
For Pat Buchanan

858
00:45:23,327 --> 00:45:24,095
1996

859
00:45:24,351 --> 00:45:25,375
Presidential campaign

860
00:45:25,631 --> 00:45:26,399
Because it came out

861
00:45:26,655 --> 00:45:27,423
But he was at that be

862
00:45:28,191 --> 00:45:32,543
But the other reason he had to step down as it was revealed that gunownersofamerica

863
00:45:32,799 --> 00:45:33,823
Had given cause

864
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:36,127
The other white supremacist organization

865
00:45:36,383 --> 00:45:36,895
X 1000

866
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:37,663
The dollars

867
00:45:38,687 --> 00:45:44,831
As the case was for everyone in the right-wing Patriot militia world the Oklahoma City bombing f***** everything

868
00:45:45,855 --> 00:45:47,135
It came out that Kirk

869
00:45:47,391 --> 00:45:49,695
Was Close Associates with Andre ostrosky

870
00:45:50,463 --> 00:45:51,487
It actually introduced him

871
00:45:51,743 --> 00:45:53,023
Two people are Elohim

872
00:45:53,279 --> 00:45:59,423
City which looks really bad but rumors started flying around that strossmayer might have had something to do with the plant

873
00:45:59,935 --> 00:46:00,447
And for the bombing

874
00:46:01,215 --> 00:46:04,799
A lot of the militia Community thought that strossmayer was working for the government

875
00:46:05,055 --> 00:46:05,823
So that Association

876
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:06,847
Was toxic there

877
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:11,199
Ironically it was the same white supremacist buddied up to who were now making

878
00:46:11,455 --> 00:46:12,223
His life hell

879
00:46:12,479 --> 00:46:18,623
As they were trying really hard to point fingers at anyone other than Timothy McVeigh

880
00:46:21,439 --> 00:46:23,487
Now he's friends with that dude

881
00:46:23,999 --> 00:46:25,279
Now he's on the man

882
00:46:26,047 --> 00:46:30,143
Now the problem is that the same world also they saw strossmayer

883
00:46:30,399 --> 00:46:31,935
A potentially a really dangerous

884
00:46:32,191 --> 00:46:35,775
Streamers who played some undefined roll-o-matic terrorist

885
00:46:36,543 --> 00:46:37,823
So his association with him

886
00:46:38,335 --> 00:46:39,359
Fictive that World 2

887
00:46:39,871 --> 00:46:44,991
Has fun with the overworked white supremacy world but it looks like it's good time was over

888
00:46:46,527 --> 00:46:47,039
Not quite over

889
00:46:48,575 --> 00:46:49,855
Really almost

890
00:46:50,367 --> 00:46:51,647
Being involved with a

891
00:46:51,903 --> 00:46:52,415
A group of

892
00:46:53,183 --> 00:46:53,695
Socio

893
00:46:54,975 --> 00:46:57,791
You just don't know when they're going to turn that sociopath

894
00:46:58,047 --> 00:46:58,815
South Park

895
00:46:59,071 --> 00:47:01,887
And you you know what I'm saying flycos

896
00:47:02,655 --> 00:47:05,471
And you can't trust on their loyalty on account of them

897
00:47:06,239 --> 00:47:07,263
Leaving interesting thought there

898
00:47:10,847 --> 00:47:12,127
Kirk knew the block was too hot

899
00:47:12,639 --> 00:47:13,919
So you decided to Rebrand

900
00:47:14,175 --> 00:47:15,199
As Jennifer Lopez

901
00:47:15,455 --> 00:47:15,967
No

902
00:47:16,735 --> 00:47:18,271
He did so by founded

903
00:47:18,527 --> 00:47:19,551
Southern legal rights

904
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:23,647
A directions

905
00:47:23,903 --> 00:47:26,719
Lrc with specifically created

906
00:47:26,975 --> 00:47:28,255
The defense Southern Heritage

907
00:47:28,511 --> 00:47:31,583
Meeting Neil

908
00:47:32,095 --> 00:47:32,607
Better

909
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:34,911
He preferred Alabama.

910
00:47:36,191 --> 00:47:40,287
So he's defending Southern Heritage called quote and ethnic cleansing of Dixie

911
00:47:41,055 --> 00:47:42,847
This was Proto demographic replaced

912
00:47:43,615 --> 00:47:44,895
It was the early versions

913
00:47:46,175 --> 00:47:51,551
He's consistently Advanced the theory that quote Confederate Southern Americans are a distinct race

914
00:47:51,807 --> 00:47:54,111
And that's deserve it I deserve a distinction as a

915
00:47:54,623 --> 00:47:55,903
Class under the Civil Rights

916
00:47:56,671 --> 00:47:58,975
Whenever the spirit is been brought out in court

917
00:47:59,231 --> 00:48:01,791
But it appears that did way better on this

918
00:48:02,303 --> 00:48:02,815
Listening donation

919
00:48:03,071 --> 00:48:03,839
From racists

920
00:48:06,399 --> 00:48:09,983
It's a failing idiot

921
00:48:10,751 --> 00:48:11,519
So here's the point

922
00:48:11,775 --> 00:48:16,639
The right-wing particular tradition

923
00:48:16,895 --> 00:48:17,919
Presenting their arguments

924
00:48:18,175 --> 00:48:18,687
Duplicitous

925
00:48:19,199 --> 00:48:21,247
I tempted to masquerade violent bigotry

926
00:48:21,503 --> 00:48:22,527
Bigotry is a civil right

927
00:48:23,039 --> 00:48:27,391
And plotting terrorist acts as against the government they feel is occupied

928
00:48:27,647 --> 00:48:28,159
Free speech

929
00:48:28,671 --> 00:48:30,207
This is a scam it's been done before

930
00:48:30,975 --> 00:48:34,303
I mean it you do it maybe the Robert Barnes isn't trying

931
00:48:35,327 --> 00:48:36,095
But I don't believe that

932
00:48:36,351 --> 00:48:39,679
He's using very similar strategies to Kirk lion

933
00:48:39,935 --> 00:48:43,519
He's using the same language about the splc only helping his enemies

934
00:48:44,031 --> 00:48:45,055
And he's got his own forts

935
00:48:45,567 --> 00:48:47,359
Sedition trial here in the form of Alex's

936
00:48:47,615 --> 00:48:48,127
Sandy Hook

937
00:48:49,151 --> 00:48:50,687
This looks like history repeating its

938
00:48:51,455 --> 00:48:54,527
What are the main reasons I feel that way is because there's already

939
00:48:54,783 --> 00:48:55,807
Plenty of groups that do it

940
00:48:56,063 --> 00:48:56,831
Exactly

941
00:48:58,111 --> 00:48:58,623
Exist

942
00:48:58,879 --> 00:49:00,159
There's already the American

943
00:49:00,415 --> 00:49:00,927
Civil rights

944
00:49:01,439 --> 00:49:03,999
Which is very active and has filed

945
00:49:04,255 --> 00:49:05,535
Defending Trump's Muslim ban

946
00:49:06,047 --> 00:49:09,375
Supporting voter ID laws and trying to help with Republican

947
00:49:11,679 --> 00:49:17,567
There's also the Southeastern Legal Foundation which just serves the purpose of the Legal Center for Cancer

948
00:49:17,823 --> 00:49:18,335
Closet

949
00:49:18,847 --> 00:49:22,943
If you want to go a little bit more libertarian with things to do with the Pacific Legal Foundation

950
00:49:23,455 --> 00:49:24,735
Which has been operating since 90

951
00:49:24,991 --> 00:49:25,503
73

952
00:49:25,759 --> 00:49:27,295
Who's priorities literally

953
00:49:27,551 --> 00:49:29,343
Wheatley overlap with what Alex

954
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:30,367
Pretends to care about

955
00:49:30,879 --> 00:49:32,415
Private property free speech

956
00:49:32,671 --> 00:49:33,183
Free association

957
00:49:33,439 --> 00:49:34,463
Due process all that

958
00:49:35,743 --> 00:49:41,887
If you want one that's religious in nature and pretty cool with you being anti-lgbtq you can mess around with the alliance defending freedom

959
00:49:42,399 --> 00:49:47,775
Or if you want one that's super Christian and kind of unclear about whether that if they have a problem with you being anti-lgbt

960
00:49:48,031 --> 00:49:49,311
You could consult these

961
00:49:49,567 --> 00:49:51,103
American Center for Law and justice

962
00:49:52,383 --> 00:49:58,527
There's already an organization called the American Freedom Law Center that is specifically about protecting

963
00:49:58,783 --> 00:50:00,831
Judeo-christian heritage

964
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:03,647
There's so many of these f****** groups already

965
00:50:03,903 --> 00:50:05,439
And many of them are very prominent

966
00:50:05,695 --> 00:50:08,255
And they all address the exact issues that Robert Barnes is

967
00:50:08,511 --> 00:50:09,791
Pretending no one addresses

968
00:50:10,303 --> 00:50:13,631
Does his need for the America of the free America Law Center

969
00:50:14,143 --> 00:50:16,447
His reason for starting the group is b*******

970
00:50:18,239 --> 00:50:18,751
I have to

971
00:50:19,007 --> 00:50:19,775
There are other reasons

972
00:50:21,311 --> 00:50:22,591
It couldn't be a scam

973
00:50:22,847 --> 00:50:23,871
You know what he's trying to fleece

974
00:50:24,127 --> 00:50:24,639
Racist video

975
00:50:25,151 --> 00:50:26,175
But my gut says

976
00:50:26,431 --> 00:50:27,711
Is that you wouldn't take to

977
00:50:27,967 --> 00:50:30,783
Take us all the way to be starting a foundation level

978
00:50:31,039 --> 00:50:32,063
If that was your goal

979
00:50:32,319 --> 00:50:32,831
Just pleasing peep

980
00:50:33,343 --> 00:50:34,367
This feels ideological

981
00:50:36,671 --> 00:50:37,695
When you look at Robert Barn

982
00:50:38,207 --> 00:50:39,231
You see his past asked

983
00:50:39,743 --> 00:50:40,511
Espace Client List

984
00:50:40,767 --> 00:50:41,791
Particularly of light

985
00:50:42,047 --> 00:50:42,815
And the way he carries

986
00:50:43,583 --> 00:50:44,351
Nothing seems right

987
00:50:46,143 --> 00:50:47,423
Conclude Charles Johnson

988
00:50:47,679 --> 00:50:50,239
Holocaust denier who kicked off Twitter for quotes to listen

989
00:50:50,495 --> 00:50:52,287
Support to take out DeRay McKesson

990
00:50:52,543 --> 00:50:54,335
Who has you know is a civil rights leader

991
00:50:55,103 --> 00:50:55,615
An activist

992
00:50:56,639 --> 00:50:59,455
That case was thrown out of court but not before Barnes had the chance to

993
00:50:59,711 --> 00:51:00,479
The frame the whole thing is

994
00:51:00,735 --> 00:51:01,503
Censorship

995
00:51:01,759 --> 00:51:04,831
Antisocial media and all that all those good narrative

996
00:51:10,975 --> 00:51:13,535
Anti-everything

997
00:51:13,791 --> 00:51:15,327
Threatens to kill a man in

998
00:51:15,583 --> 00:51:17,375
Makes a detailed plan about it

999
00:51:17,631 --> 00:51:21,215
You guys are all up in arms

1000
00:51:22,495 --> 00:51:26,591
Even though it got thrown out of court and people think

1001
00:51:26,847 --> 00:51:27,359
The joke

1002
00:51:27,615 --> 00:51:29,407
Penny represented Cassandra

1003
00:51:29,663 --> 00:51:31,455
A reporter at Fusion

1004
00:51:31,711 --> 00:51:33,759
For saying that her making the okay hamster

1005
00:51:34,015 --> 00:51:35,551
Signal along with Mike's

1006
00:51:35,807 --> 00:51:36,831
Picture taken at the White House

1007
00:51:37,087 --> 00:51:38,111
What's a white power sign

1008
00:51:38,879 --> 00:51:41,695
That case also got thrown out but not before Barnes had a chance

1009
00:51:42,719 --> 00:51:45,535
Is it critical First Amendment and anti-media narrative

1010
00:51:48,351 --> 00:51:48,863
With that

1011
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:52,703
His latest hustle outside Alex is representing the Covington kids

1012
00:51:53,215 --> 00:51:59,359
By representing them I mean he's going around threatening to sue everyone in the media Place Elizabeth Warren and apparently a lot of

1013
00:51:59,871 --> 00:52:01,663
Because they smoke

1014
00:52:01,919 --> 00:52:02,687
White boys

1015
00:52:03,455 --> 00:52:07,551
Any particularly dramatic move back in January gave the people who spoke ill of the kids

1016
00:52:07,807 --> 00:52:08,575
48 hours

1017
00:52:08,831 --> 00:52:10,367
Mr. retractor slanderous words

1018
00:52:10,623 --> 00:52:12,159
Or face the wrath of his lawsuit

1019
00:52:13,439 --> 00:52:14,719
Steam to get thrown out of court a lot

1020
00:52:15,743 --> 00:52:18,303
After rebate is very serious and very real threat

1021
00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:21,375
He was the target of another very serious and totally real threat

1022
00:52:21,631 --> 00:52:23,167
When someone

1023
00:52:23,423 --> 00:52:23,935
Threat

1024
00:52:24,447 --> 00:52:27,263
To be clear I don't think that anyone should ever even jokingly threatened

1025
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:29,823
Can someone see messages

1026
00:52:30,335 --> 00:52:31,871
S*** and probably should have some

1027
00:52:32,127 --> 00:52:32,639
Some consequences

1028
00:52:33,151 --> 00:52:34,431
But it's hilarious at Barnes

1029
00:52:34,687 --> 00:52:35,199
Decided to take

1030
00:52:35,455 --> 00:52:37,247
Seriously it takes

1031
00:52:37,503 --> 00:52:38,783
Proclaim his victimhood about that

1032
00:52:39,807 --> 00:52:42,879
He made a mistake by sending a screenshot of this email that he

1033
00:52:43,647 --> 00:52:44,159
2 media out

1034
00:52:44,671 --> 00:52:46,719
Oh nothing

1035
00:52:46,975 --> 00:52:50,047
Oh no

1036
00:52:50,815 --> 00:52:52,351
One is it Barnes uses Gmail

1037
00:52:52,607 --> 00:52:53,375
Which is weird

1038
00:52:56,191 --> 00:52:57,471
Form submission on his website

1039
00:52:57,727 --> 00:52:58,495
Barnes law

1040
00:52:58,751 --> 00:53:00,799
Which you runs through Squarespace

1041
00:53:01,311 --> 00:53:02,847
Which is a little sad for someone

1042
00:53:03,103 --> 00:53:03,615
Supposition

1043
00:53:03,871 --> 00:53:06,175
I use Squarespace for Fox Say

1044
00:53:06,687 --> 00:53:12,831
He's supposed to be a big-time high-end lawyer he's got a goddamn $20 a month website going the f*** out of here Barn

1045
00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:16,671
The reason I bring those two things up as it's Christmas is a huge comp

1046
00:53:17,183 --> 00:53:21,023
And this isn't the first time someone has realized

1047
00:53:21,279 --> 00:53:21,791
Pittsfield in

1048
00:53:22,047 --> 00:53:23,839
And send threatening things to people

1049
00:53:24,351 --> 00:53:25,631
That doesn't make them anonymous

1050
00:53:26,143 --> 00:53:27,679
In order to relay the message to Barnes

1051
00:53:27,935 --> 00:53:30,751
This email I got it incredibly unlikely that a footprint wouldn't

1052
00:53:31,007 --> 00:53:31,519
Be left behind

1053
00:53:31,775 --> 00:53:32,799
Person type

1054
00:53:33,055 --> 00:53:36,127
The address wasn't logged by the server that the message through

1055
00:53:36,639 --> 00:53:37,151
Guess what

1056
00:53:38,175 --> 00:53:38,687
Guess what

1057
00:53:39,967 --> 00:53:40,735
It's coming from inside

1058
00:53:41,247 --> 00:53:45,087
No I don't think there's necessarily was I think this is just

1059
00:53:45,343 --> 00:53:45,855
Selective

1060
00:53:46,111 --> 00:53:46,879
Media manipulation

1061
00:53:47,135 --> 00:53:53,279
Epoch Times article says quote he's received thousands of messages that's picking up the case and I haven't been able to

1062
00:53:53,535 --> 00:53:54,303
Sister all of them

1063
00:53:55,071 --> 00:53:59,679
I find that weird because the subject line of that threat email is quote you're a racist piece of s***

1064
00:54:00,191 --> 00:54:00,959
I don't say anything

1065
00:54:01,983 --> 00:54:05,055
At all

1066
00:54:05,311 --> 00:54:06,335
But all threatened

1067
00:54:06,847 --> 00:54:07,871
Hey Joe it's just insulting

1068
00:54:08,383 --> 00:54:08,895
Free speech

1069
00:54:09,151 --> 00:54:11,711
Is Barnes my check

1070
00:54:12,223 --> 00:54:16,319
He received that message at 10:45 a.m. on January 23rd

1071
00:54:16,575 --> 00:54:19,391
An Epoch Times article was published on January

1072
00:54:19,647 --> 00:54:20,159
Fourth

1073
00:54:20,671 --> 00:54:26,815
I find it incredibly hard to believe that he has thousands of messages he can't get through all of them but somehow he saw this one created media blitz

1074
00:54:27,071 --> 00:54:28,863
I thought of it in under 24 hours

1075
00:54:29,887 --> 00:54:31,679
It's even harder to believe when you realize that

1076
00:54:32,447 --> 00:54:34,751
X was late to the game on this store

1077
00:54:35,263 --> 00:54:38,847
The Gateway pundit heading article up before 5 p.m. on the 23rd

1078
00:54:39,103 --> 00:54:39,615
She Howard

1079
00:54:39,871 --> 00:54:44,223
After he received this email

1080
00:54:44,479 --> 00:54:46,527
Breaking exclusive story for the Gateway pundit

1081
00:54:46,783 --> 00:54:48,319
Why it's Cassandra Fairbanks

1082
00:54:50,367 --> 00:54:52,159
In what is her legal publicity stunt

1083
00:54:52,671 --> 00:54:54,207
So weird

1084
00:54:54,463 --> 00:54:54,975
My God I hate

1085
00:54:55,487 --> 00:54:58,559
People so much suspicion

1086
00:54:59,071 --> 00:55:00,607
And now here with Alex he is

1087
00:55:00,863 --> 00:55:03,167
Barnes has the perfect opportunity to Parlay this case

1088
00:55:03,423 --> 00:55:05,471
Pretty much a limitless self-promotion

1089
00:55:05,983 --> 00:55:09,311
He's representing a guy with a media Empire that's not doing great financial

1090
00:55:09,823 --> 00:55:11,871
He needs a lawyer you need publicity

1091
00:55:12,127 --> 00:55:13,151
Perfect it works out

1092
00:55:14,175 --> 00:55:15,199
But publicity

1093
00:55:15,711 --> 00:55:16,991
Wasn't about his own

1094
00:55:18,015 --> 00:55:21,343
Or even getting his own show and usurping Alex's We've joked about

1095
00:55:21,855 --> 00:55:23,903
I suspected it was about this all along

1096
00:55:24,159 --> 00:55:26,207
And it looks like now the transition is beginning

1097
00:55:26,463 --> 00:55:31,327
Barnes is openly promoting the America free America loss center on Alex's

1098
00:55:31,583 --> 00:55:34,399
Tell his listeners to donate to this cause

1099
00:55:34,911 --> 00:55:39,007
I mean if you go to the Barnes as website Barnes law his Law Firm

1100
00:55:39,775 --> 00:55:40,799
In the cases

1101
00:55:41,055 --> 00:55:42,591
Section Alex isn't in there

1102
00:55:43,103 --> 00:55:45,919
You go to the free America Law Center cases

1103
00:55:46,431 --> 00:55:46,943
Alex is in the

1104
00:55:47,455 --> 00:55:50,271
He's moving this stuff over there

1105
00:55:50,527 --> 00:55:52,575
In order to build up a more robust

1106
00:55:53,087 --> 00:55:55,647
Sing it if you look at the history of a lot of these

1107
00:55:55,903 --> 00:55:56,671
These organization

1108
00:55:57,183 --> 00:55:58,463
The ones that do exist

1109
00:55:58,719 --> 00:55:59,999
Don't have scam history

1110
00:56:00,767 --> 00:56:01,791
Bright lights

1111
00:56:02,047 --> 00:56:03,839
Conservative or liberal Therrien

1112
00:56:04,863 --> 00:56:05,631
Public

1113
00:56:05,887 --> 00:56:07,679
Law organization

1114
00:56:08,191 --> 00:56:09,471
Don't have like

1115
00:56:09,727 --> 00:56:10,239
Ha

1116
00:56:10,495 --> 00:56:16,639
We're going to f****** just support these grifter assholes and their Felicity stunts and see what we can do

1117
00:56:19,199 --> 00:56:19,711
Start

1118
00:56:20,223 --> 00:56:20,735
Bye

1119
00:56:21,503 --> 00:56:22,527
Something like

1120
00:56:22,783 --> 00:56:24,575
The Patriots defense fund

1121
00:56:25,087 --> 00:56:26,879
Comes out of

1122
00:56:27,391 --> 00:56:28,159
Mentality

1123
00:56:28,671 --> 00:56:29,695
So I'm worried

1124
00:56:29,951 --> 00:56:33,279
I'm worried I'm not saying I need to be clear about that

1125
00:56:33,535 --> 00:56:35,327
I'm not saying that what Barnes is doing is it

1126
00:56:35,583 --> 00:56:36,351
Exactly the same

1127
00:56:36,607 --> 00:56:38,143
What Kirk Lions did

1128
00:56:38,399 --> 00:56:39,679
Inasmuch as like

1129
00:56:40,191 --> 00:56:41,727
You know Kirkland's was straight-up

1130
00:56:41,983 --> 00:56:42,751
Hanging out with

1131
00:56:43,007 --> 00:56:43,519
And defending

1132
00:56:44,031 --> 00:56:45,567
Real neo-nazis

1133
00:56:45,823 --> 00:56:49,151
Ed white supremacist

1134
00:56:49,407 --> 00:56:49,919
Call Alex

1135
00:56:50,175 --> 00:56:56,319
I don't II

1136
00:56:57,087 --> 00:56:59,135
There is an absolute on the radio

1137
00:57:02,207 --> 00:57:03,743
I think I think that you could

1138
00:57:03,999 --> 00:57:06,047
You could make an argument that some of the

1139
00:57:06,303 --> 00:57:08,095
The form and function of their

1140
00:57:08,351 --> 00:57:11,679
The rhetoric is maybe similar there's overlap

1141
00:57:12,191 --> 00:57:13,727
But in terms of what they're doing

1142
00:57:13,983 --> 00:57:14,495
You can't even

1143
00:57:14,751 --> 00:57:15,519
Come close to a

1144
00:57:16,031 --> 00:57:17,567
Once I started the Aryan Nation

1145
00:57:17,823 --> 00:57:18,591
One guy

1146
00:57:19,103 --> 00:57:19,615
Screams

1147
00:57:21,151 --> 00:57:23,711
Incredibly bigoted s*** on a radio show

1148
00:57:23,967 --> 00:57:24,479
But

1149
00:57:24,991 --> 00:57:26,783
He's finally some people into the Aryan Nation

1150
00:57:27,551 --> 00:57:28,063
So

1151
00:57:28,575 --> 00:57:31,135
I guess the other guy started

1152
00:57:36,255 --> 00:57:38,047
If you want to put it that way

1153
00:57:38,559 --> 00:57:39,839
A f****** nightmare book

1154
00:57:40,351 --> 00:57:41,631
Concerned

1155
00:57:41,887 --> 00:57:42,399
About this

1156
00:57:42,655 --> 00:57:44,191
Free America Law Center

1157
00:57:44,703 --> 00:57:48,543
Because I think that it could Bode

1158
00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:49,311
It could turn in

1159
00:57:49,567 --> 00:57:50,079
Into

1160
00:57:50,847 --> 00:57:51,871
A form

1161
00:57:52,127 --> 00:57:53,407
Where Barn

1162
00:57:53,663 --> 00:57:54,175
Is able

1163
00:57:54,431 --> 00:57:54,943
Go to

1164
00:57:55,199 --> 00:57:56,223
Revivalist

1165
00:57:56,479 --> 00:57:56,991
Cover

1166
00:57:57,247 --> 00:57:57,759
For a lot of these

1167
00:57:58,271 --> 00:57:58,783
Is that

1168
00:57:59,039 --> 00:58:00,319
Should had propaganda

1169
00:58:00,831 --> 00:58:02,367
Racial agitators

1170
00:58:02,623 --> 00:58:03,647
Anti-lgbt

1171
00:58:03,903 --> 00:58:04,927
Teq activist

1172
00:58:05,439 --> 00:58:06,975
Some of the more Fringe

1173
00:58:07,487 --> 00:58:08,255
Dangerous

1174
00:58:08,511 --> 00:58:09,023
People within

1175
00:58:09,279 --> 00:58:10,303
DirecTV

1176
00:58:11,327 --> 00:58:15,167
And so I wanted to get more into it but Alex hasn't talked about it all that much

1177
00:58:15,423 --> 00:58:19,775
Except for this plug really heard them bring it up all too much in his other appearances

1178
00:58:20,031 --> 00:58:23,359
Know that Barnes was starting

1179
00:58:23,615 --> 00:58:24,127
Started

1180
00:58:25,407 --> 00:58:26,687
I was like well alright

1181
00:58:26,943 --> 00:58:28,991
I got to go check out other things Barn

1182
00:58:29,247 --> 00:58:30,015
Princess.

1183
00:58:30,527 --> 00:58:32,063
And so I decided to listen

1184
00:58:32,319 --> 00:58:35,903
To his interview with Stefan molyneux you don't have any clue

1185
00:58:36,415 --> 00:58:36,927
Bangla Natok

1186
00:58:37,439 --> 00:58:37,951
Do you have a bunch

1187
00:58:38,719 --> 00:58:41,791
Heat have route sorry

1188
00:58:42,047 --> 00:58:42,559
Sorry

1189
00:58:42,815 --> 00:58:46,399
The rest of this episode we're going to be going over Robert Barnes

1190
00:58:46,655 --> 00:58:47,679
And appearing on Stefan molyneux

1191
00:58:47,935 --> 00:58:51,519
Because they talk a bit more about what Barnes wants to

1192
00:58:51,775 --> 00:58:54,079
To do

1193
00:58:54,591 --> 00:58:59,967
And I figure like okay if I have by theories and my ideas about what his motivations are

1194
00:59:00,479 --> 00:59:02,015
I need to hear them talk more about

1195
00:59:02,527 --> 00:59:04,319
And this is the Forum

1196
00:59:04,575 --> 00:59:06,367
He did have an hour to talk about

1197
00:59:07,135 --> 00:59:08,415
Here's my here's my

1198
00:59:09,439 --> 00:59:09,951
Free game

1199
00:59:10,463 --> 00:59:10,975
Free guy

1200
00:59:11,487 --> 00:59:11,999
Alright

1201
00:59:12,511 --> 00:59:14,559
When you file one of those bulshit lawsuit

1202
00:59:15,327 --> 00:59:16,095
Cassandra Fairbanks

1203
00:59:17,375 --> 00:59:18,911
You got to put up the money right up

1204
00:59:19,935 --> 00:59:21,215
And then you got to ask for donations

1205
00:59:23,519 --> 00:59:24,287
You got donation

1206
00:59:25,055 --> 00:59:25,823
Coming and going

1207
00:59:26,335 --> 00:59:28,127
You have a lot Center where they donate to

1208
00:59:28,383 --> 00:59:28,895
So you don't have to

1209
00:59:29,151 --> 00:59:29,663
Even put up any

1210
00:59:30,687 --> 00:59:31,199
Defiled

1211
00:59:32,735 --> 00:59:34,271
People are already donated

1212
00:59:35,039 --> 00:59:36,319
Then whenever you filed

1213
00:59:36,831 --> 00:59:38,367
You get to campaign for donation

1214
00:59:39,647 --> 00:59:40,415
You have just got to

1215
00:59:40,671 --> 00:59:42,207
Giant funnel of money off

1216
00:59:42,463 --> 00:59:46,815
For you without ever having to spend any of your own

1217
00:59:49,631 --> 00:59:51,935
It's going I don't believe that

1218
00:59:52,191 --> 00:59:53,471
1776

1219
00:59:54,239 --> 00:59:54,751
Subscription

1220
00:59:55,007 --> 00:59:58,591
Are going to pay for like high-end lawsuit

1221
00:59:58,847 --> 01:00:00,895
Like I just don't think the subscriber base

1222
01:00:01,151 --> 01:00:02,687
Is generally what he's

1223
01:00:02,943 --> 01:00:03,711
Pretending it is

1224
01:00:03,967 --> 01:00:04,479
You would

1225
01:00:04,735 --> 01:00:05,503
Still need

1226
01:00:05,759 --> 01:00:06,783
High-end benefactors

1227
01:00:07,295 --> 01:00:10,367
That would be something that you would be able to mask

1228
01:00:10,879 --> 01:00:12,159
With one of these

1229
01:00:13,695 --> 01:00:14,975
You know non-for-profit

1230
01:00:15,231 --> 01:00:17,791
I have 501 c 3 Type organization

1231
01:00:18,303 --> 01:00:18,815
So

1232
01:00:19,071 --> 01:00:22,399
Gets into this interview and he starts

1233
01:00:23,167 --> 01:00:24,703
Describe

1234
01:00:24,959 --> 01:00:25,983
As Barnes

1235
01:00:27,007 --> 01:00:27,519
Plan

1236
01:00:27,775 --> 01:00:31,103
Clearly communicated prior to this

1237
01:00:31,359 --> 01:00:32,639
Explain what he's up to

1238
01:00:33,407 --> 01:00:35,199
Ivypool as well

1239
01:00:36,223 --> 01:00:42,367
Extraordinaire

1240
01:00:45,439 --> 01:00:49,791
Banana that I think it's helped with some of the challenges of

1241
01:00:50,047 --> 01:00:56,191
You know if you're not on the laptop if you criticize in the public eye for more than 8 to 12 minutes at a time

1242
01:00:56,703 --> 01:01:02,847
Then the tsunami of you like some help

1243
01:01:04,127 --> 01:01:10,271
Oh well I'm sure this can be easily corrected

1244
01:01:10,527 --> 01:01:12,831
Not good

1245
01:01:13,087 --> 01:01:19,231
Problems of having to prove actual malice and

1246
01:01:20,255 --> 01:01:22,047
So the reports in America

1247
01:01:22,559 --> 01:01:26,399
I think tipped a little bit more towards the First Amendment rather than

1248
01:01:26,655 --> 01:01:27,935
Reputational protection

1249
01:01:28,447 --> 01:01:32,287
I can take the approach that is very interesting.

1250
01:01:37,407 --> 01:01:37,919
So

1251
01:01:38,687 --> 01:01:42,271
Savant wait you know I'm

1252
01:01:42,527 --> 01:01:48,671
What's the first amendment when it comes to reputational protectant

1253
01:01:48,927 --> 01:01:50,975
That's tough to square with

1254
01:01:51,231 --> 01:01:52,511
That's bananas

1255
01:01:52,767 --> 01:01:58,911
Opening up

1256
01:02:00,191 --> 01:02:01,727
You know there is there is

1257
01:02:01,983 --> 01:02:03,263
Thematic similarity between

1258
01:02:04,031 --> 01:02:05,823
Yeah I mean

1259
01:02:06,591 --> 01:02:08,639
He's advocating for his Ludacris

1260
01:02:09,151 --> 01:02:13,247
Jenkins like your someone does lie about you you can still demand a retraction

1261
01:02:13,503 --> 01:02:15,551
There's no actual malice

1262
01:02:15,807 --> 01:02:18,111
Just like you can still do that only is about

1263
01:02:19,135 --> 01:02:21,951
And if you threw them you definitely should have to prove

1264
01:02:22,207 --> 01:02:23,231
There was

1265
01:02:25,023 --> 01:02:26,303
There there lie about you

1266
01:02:27,071 --> 01:02:30,143
So I don't worry

1267
01:02:30,399 --> 01:02:31,423
Approved

1268
01:02:32,447 --> 01:02:35,007
That's true too

1269
01:02:35,263 --> 01:02:36,543
Issue with a lot of those lawsuit

1270
01:02:37,055 --> 01:02:38,079
They're saying

1271
01:02:38,847 --> 01:02:41,151
Yeah later

1272
01:02:41,407 --> 01:02:43,711
Complaining about

1273
01:02:43,967 --> 01:02:46,527
Yo cuz of these these meet like these

1274
01:02:46,783 --> 01:02:52,159
All these big companies know good things about certain people out there

1275
01:02:52,415 --> 01:02:54,975
Like what

1276
01:02:55,999 --> 01:02:59,327
What if you're just messing with me.

1277
01:02:59,583 --> 01:03:05,215
Will ever be a value to the recipe

1278
01:03:05,471 --> 01:03:08,031
All I see is negative things tweeted at me

1279
01:03:09,311 --> 01:03:11,103
That's clearly because of tech center

1280
01:03:11,359 --> 01:03:14,431
As opposed to think bad things

1281
01:03:14,687 --> 01:03:15,455
Cuz there's no

1282
01:03:15,711 --> 01:03:16,479
Possible way

1283
01:03:17,247 --> 01:03:18,527
Is that everybody couldn't

1284
01:03:19,039 --> 01:03:19,551
Agree that I'm

1285
01:03:19,807 --> 01:03:20,319
I'm the greatest

1286
01:03:20,831 --> 01:03:23,135
I don't understand why.

1287
01:03:23,391 --> 01:03:25,695
Estimation the function of the narcissism

1288
01:03:25,951 --> 01:03:32,095
Something comes along with this world to like just no way I could be wrong is no way that anyone could just like

1289
01:03:33,119 --> 01:03:37,471
So you know

1290
01:03:37,727 --> 01:03:39,519
Is a problem because of

1291
01:03:40,031 --> 01:03:42,079
The need to protect my reputation

1292
01:03:42,335 --> 01:03:43,103
Shower something

1293
01:03:43,615 --> 01:03:44,383
Which

1294
01:03:44,895 --> 01:03:45,407
Seems silly

1295
01:03:46,687 --> 01:03:48,223
Gets into answering

1296
01:03:49,247 --> 01:03:50,783
So the goal was we needed a legal

1297
01:03:53,087 --> 01:03:53,599
The Southern poverty

1298
01:03:53,855 --> 01:03:54,367
Lawson

1299
01:03:55,903 --> 01:03:56,671
Southern Poverty Law

1300
01:03:57,439 --> 01:03:59,231
Sort of equivalent of the ACLU

1301
01:04:00,511 --> 01:04:01,279
For all people not to

1302
01:04:03,839 --> 01:04:04,863
That Just Cause 2

1303
01:04:05,631 --> 01:04:06,143
What's on porch

1304
01:04:06,399 --> 01:04:08,703
The ACLU has mostly done today

1305
01:04:08,959 --> 01:04:10,239
We needed something like that

1306
01:04:11,007 --> 01:04:12,031
People on the political right

1307
01:04:12,287 --> 01:04:13,311
Libertarian for Independence

1308
01:04:13,823 --> 01:04:14,847
People who aren't part of the

1309
01:04:15,103 --> 01:04:16,127
The cultural cachet

1310
01:04:16,639 --> 01:04:17,919
Already exist

1311
01:04:18,431 --> 01:04:23,295
How's it going over 100 times the framing of this presentation

1312
01:04:23,551 --> 01:04:24,575
Is alive

1313
01:04:25,087 --> 01:04:29,695
If you want to make the argument that like these things do exist

1314
01:04:30,463 --> 01:04:31,231
Then

1315
01:04:31,743 --> 01:04:35,583
You would be coming from a more honest perspective if you wanted to say

1316
01:04:35,839 --> 01:04:39,167
Alright I'm Robert Barnes I believe Indies libertarian

1317
01:04:39,679 --> 01:04:41,215
Conservatives ideas

1318
01:04:41,471 --> 01:04:45,311
Therefore I'm going to join up with this other existing

1319
01:04:45,567 --> 01:04:48,895
Public Law organization that already serves those enter

1320
01:04:49,407 --> 01:04:51,711
Work with like to make that better

1321
01:04:51,967 --> 01:04:52,991
So it can

1322
01:04:53,247 --> 01:04:54,783
BV

1323
01:04:56,831 --> 01:04:58,879
Like you're our existing framework

1324
01:04:59,135 --> 01:05:00,159
Better run by Lake

1325
01:05:00,927 --> 01:05:01,951
Very credible people

1326
01:05:02,207 --> 01:05:05,535
You know people who of high stature in in

1327
01:05:05,791 --> 01:05:06,815
In society

1328
01:05:07,071 --> 01:05:09,887
This reminds me so much of the

1329
01:05:10,143 --> 01:05:14,751
Muslim leaders to hardcore Muslim terrorist

1330
01:05:15,007 --> 01:05:19,103
We never hear from the leaders of Islam

1331
01:05:19,359 --> 01:05:21,919
Aesthetic

1332
01:05:22,175 --> 01:05:23,199
And then it's like

1333
01:05:23,455 --> 01:05:23,967
Cuz you didn't

1334
01:05:24,223 --> 01:05:24,735
Google it

1335
01:05:24,991 --> 01:05:25,503
4 / 2

1336
01:05:26,271 --> 01:05:26,783
You don't

1337
01:05:27,039 --> 01:05:27,551
Want to hear

1338
01:05:28,063 --> 01:05:30,367
You don't want to know that they're all ready to start exactly

1339
01:05:32,415 --> 01:05:33,439
Possible but I honestly

1340
01:05:33,695 --> 01:05:35,231
Think that it's more that what he wants

1341
01:05:35,487 --> 01:05:35,999
To do with differ

1342
01:05:36,255 --> 01:05:40,351
Yeah he doesn't really want to bring into the conversation that are real scene

1343
01:05:40,863 --> 01:05:46,239
And even slightly insane version of

1344
01:05:46,495 --> 01:05:50,591
Yeah he doesn't want to talk about that cuz he resent this is a new and novel idea

1345
01:05:51,103 --> 01:05:54,431
Idea that the left has been dominating and

1346
01:05:54,687 --> 01:05:57,247
The only people who are in that space

1347
01:05:57,503 --> 01:05:59,039
Public Law

1348
01:05:59,551 --> 01:06:03,135
Because if he doesn't what he's doing just seems like it

1349
01:06:03,647 --> 01:06:06,975
It's already exists

1350
01:06:07,231 --> 01:06:11,071
Right question why are you doing this

1351
01:06:12,095 --> 01:06:16,447
Because if you're trying to create an antidote on the right to the ACLU

1352
01:06:16,959 --> 01:06:18,239
And you're really going for it

1353
01:06:18,751 --> 01:06:21,055
You are going to wind up creating the ACLU

1354
01:06:21,823 --> 01:06:23,615
You know you're just going to do the same thing that they do

1355
01:06:24,383 --> 01:06:30,527
It's just because that's how that that's how that works there are some conservative-leaning

1356
01:06:30,783 --> 01:06:31,551
Publix

1357
01:06:32,063 --> 01:06:32,575
Civil rights

1358
01:06:33,087 --> 01:06:34,367
Liberty face

1359
01:06:34,623 --> 01:06:36,415
Organization

1360
01:06:37,695 --> 01:06:42,815
Fairly

1361
01:06:43,071 --> 01:06:49,215
Yeah because if you're caring about what

1362
01:06:49,471 --> 01:06:51,263
Absolutely actually have prints

1363
01:06:51,775 --> 01:06:53,311
Then

1364
01:06:53,567 --> 01:06:54,591
OSHA

1365
01:06:54,847 --> 01:06:56,127
I care more about

1366
01:06:56,639 --> 01:07:00,735
Doing things the right way or the legal way than I do about lying

1367
01:07:00,991 --> 01:07:07,135
It's very imaginable very conservative and a liberal could come together on the discussion about whether

1368
01:07:07,391 --> 01:07:07,903
Whether or not

1369
01:07:08,159 --> 01:07:10,207
The kid in the DC sniper case

1370
01:07:10,463 --> 01:07:16,607
Deserves a new trial based on agree or disagree

1371
01:07:16,863 --> 01:07:19,423
Proposition proposition

1372
01:07:19,679 --> 01:07:21,727
But there's no reason why a group

1373
01:07:21,983 --> 01:07:24,031
Interested individual right

1374
01:07:24,287 --> 01:07:26,335
No matter the political alignment

1375
01:07:26,591 --> 01:07:27,103
Integreon that

1376
01:07:27,359 --> 01:07:27,871
Absolutely

1377
01:07:29,151 --> 01:07:29,919
It's just

1378
01:07:30,175 --> 01:07:33,503
Shady s***

1379
01:07:33,759 --> 01:07:34,527
That's because

1380
01:07:34,783 --> 01:07:35,807
I would hazard

1381
01:07:36,831 --> 01:07:37,855
If you are going to ask

1382
01:07:38,111 --> 01:07:38,623
Billy give a s***

1383
01:07:39,135 --> 01:07:39,903
You going to litigate

1384
01:07:40,927 --> 01:07:41,439
And you want them to

1385
01:07:41,951 --> 01:07:43,231
If you want to go to trial

1386
01:07:43,999 --> 01:07:46,047
Then that means in order to win your case

1387
01:07:46,303 --> 01:07:47,071
You have to accept

1388
01:07:47,583 --> 01:07:48,095
Shared real

1389
01:07:48,607 --> 01:07:50,399
Both sides agree

1390
01:07:50,655 --> 01:07:51,679
On what the facts

1391
01:07:52,703 --> 01:07:53,727
And so then

1392
01:07:53,983 --> 01:07:57,311
You find out so much that ideology and all that

1393
01:07:57,823 --> 01:07:59,103
Doesn't apply

1394
01:08:00,127 --> 01:08:00,639
Actually not real

1395
01:08:02,943 --> 01:08:03,455
Grifter case

1396
01:08:03,967 --> 01:08:06,271
They're fundamentally imagine

1397
01:08:06,783 --> 01:08:08,575
Right there using public opinion

1398
01:08:08,831 --> 01:08:12,671
The court of public opinion versus the court of court

1399
01:08:12,927 --> 01:08:14,463
And that's all

1400
01:08:15,231 --> 01:08:18,815
Free America Law Center would be

1401
01:08:19,071 --> 01:08:20,095
Incredibly effective

1402
01:08:20,351 --> 01:08:21,119
In terms of

1403
01:08:21,375 --> 01:08:23,423
The the court of public opinion

1404
01:08:23,679 --> 01:08:26,239
It would be something that could be used as

1405
01:08:27,775 --> 01:08:29,311
Just

1406
01:08:29,567 --> 01:08:31,103
Media arm of these

1407
01:08:32,895 --> 01:08:34,175
I don't know I don't know what to called

1408
01:08:35,711 --> 01:08:38,015
Dabblers and extremism

1409
01:08:39,807 --> 01:08:41,343
Centers that do side with

1410
01:08:42,111 --> 01:08:43,391
You of course they're not going to

1411
01:08:43,647 --> 01:08:44,159
To draw in those

1412
01:08:44,415 --> 01:08:44,927
Same level of do

1413
01:08:45,695 --> 01:08:48,511
Because sometimes they do things that the propaganda says are wrong

1414
01:08:49,023 --> 01:08:52,351
Maybe they thought it would

1415
01:08:52,863 --> 01:08:54,143
Adventures would be more successful

1416
01:08:54,399 --> 01:08:55,679
Or not I think it was doomed

1417
01:08:55,935 --> 01:08:58,495
But it also scares me

1418
01:08:58,751 --> 01:08:59,775
Because I'm

1419
01:09:00,031 --> 01:09:01,567
It could be a very

1420
01:09:02,079 --> 01:09:02,591
Very day

1421
01:09:02,847 --> 01:09:03,359
Dangerous organization

1422
01:09:04,383 --> 01:09:07,455
Text Claire Barnes talks about how the left

1423
01:09:08,223 --> 01:09:08,735
You know

1424
01:09:09,503 --> 01:09:10,527
The Virtue signal

1425
01:09:10,783 --> 01:09:11,551
Sure we do

1426
01:09:16,415 --> 01:09:17,695
The second thing the left as well

1427
01:09:18,207 --> 01:09:20,767
It because virtue-signaling matter so much to

1428
01:09:26,143 --> 01:09:26,655
In ways

1429
01:09:26,911 --> 01:09:27,679
Generally conservative

1430
01:09:29,727 --> 01:09:31,263
Some value for what they give their money for

1431
01:09:32,543 --> 01:09:33,055
Difficult

1434
01:09:36,895 --> 01:09:38,431
Knowing the lawsuits going to move forward

1435
01:09:38,687 --> 01:09:40,991
The goal was to create a legal organization

1436
01:09:41,247 --> 01:09:43,295
And it serves the interest

1437
01:09:43,551 --> 01:09:44,575
Call people all across the

Democratize access

Organization

1458
01:10:19,391 --> 01:10:21,439
I feel like that price

1459
01:10:21,695 --> 01:10:22,975
Is virtue signaling

1460
01:10:23,743 --> 01:10:27,071
Absolutely

1461
01:10:27,583 --> 01:10:28,351
Absolutely

1462
01:10:28,863 --> 01:10:33,727
That price is not based on the free market

1463
01:10:33,983 --> 01:10:40,127
It certainly seems to be

1464
01:10:40,383 --> 01:10:46,527
Ali's left is a virtue signal with

1465
01:10:46,783 --> 01:10:50,623
Crowdfunding

1466
01:10:53,183 --> 01:10:54,719
I love

1467
01:10:54,975 --> 01:10:56,511
The inverted reality

1468
01:10:57,023 --> 01:10:57,535
People thinking

1469
01:10:57,791 --> 01:10:59,071
That's all the cousins

01:10:59,583 --> 01:11:00,351
We donate to

1471
01:11:00,863 --> 01:11:02,143
Have no value

1472
01:11:02,399 --> 01:11:03,679
And yet they would donate to

1473
01:11:03,935 --> 01:11:04,447
F******

1474
01:11:04,703 --> 01:11:07,263
Because they want to get something for their money

1475
01:11:08,287 --> 01:11:10,591

01:11:40,543 --> 01:11:41,567
Yourself

1489
01:11:42,079 --> 01:11:43,103
You better protect their own rights

1490
01:11:43,359 --> 01:11:43,871
Defend their rights

1491
01:11:45,663 --> 01:11:46,175
Volume

1492
01:11:47,455 --> 01:11:48,735
The same time prank

1493
01:11:50,015 --> 01:11:50,783
Clyde the Mack

1494
01:11:54,367 --> 01:12:00,511
How f****** weird is at the idea that Barnes is like if you donate you can vote on what cases Altec

1495
01:12:00,767 --> 01:12:05,119
That doesn't seem like it's principles

1496
01:12:05,375 --> 01:12:08,191
That is absolutely ridiculous

1497
01:12:08,447 --> 01:12:08,959
That is

1498
01:12:11,519 --> 01:12:15,103
I don't have any books

1499
01:12:15,359 --> 01:12:16,383
That's at least like

1500
01:12:16,639 --> 01:12:17,151
That's something

1501
01:12:17,407 --> 01:12:20,735
I suppose

1502
01:12:21,759 --> 01:12:22,527
Pressured voice

1503
01:12:22,783 --> 01:12:23,551
Van Dyke

1504
01:12:24,063 --> 01:12:24,831
Enjoy that podcast

1505
01:12:27,135 --> 01:12:27,647
Is trouble

1506
01:12:27,903 --> 01:12:28,671
Oh no that's

1507
01:12:28,927 --> 01:12:33,023
I can't imagine gamify as the entire thing

1508
01:12:33,279 --> 01:12:38,399
Really doesn't seem like a good way to run a lot better

1509
01:12:38,911 --> 01:12:39,679
People learn the list

1510
01:12:39,935 --> 01:12:40,959
Voting

1511
01:12:44,031 --> 01:12:46,079
Boaty mcboatface whenever you are like

1512
01:12:46,335 --> 01:12:48,383
I'm going to open this up to the Internet

1513
01:12:49,151 --> 01:12:50,687
To make a good decision

1514
01:12:54,271 --> 01:12:55,039
Exactly

1515
01:12:57,599 --> 01:12:59,647
But you know you got to do something

1516
01:13:00,671 --> 01:13:02,975
The baby this is bad idea

1517
01:13:03,231 --> 01:13:03,743
Because there's a

1518
01:13:04,255 --> 01:13:05,791
Conspiracy going on

1519
01:13:06,047 --> 01:13:07,839
Robert Barnes is fighting against

1520
01:13:08,863 --> 01:13:09,631
And what's happening

1521
01:13:10,911 --> 01:13:11,679
A big media Ark

1522
01:13:12,703 --> 01:13:13,215
In ways to

1523
01:13:13,471 --> 01:13:15,007
Depresi sensor dissident voices

1524
01:13:15,519 --> 01:13:17,055
Using their Superior Lawson

1525
01:13:17,567 --> 01:13:19,359
Inner Superior legal

1526
01:13:19,615 --> 01:13:21,151
Talent on their side of the aisle be

1527
01:13:21,919 --> 01:13:22,687
Ceaseless

1528
01:13:23,199 --> 01:13:23,967
An endless retainer

1529
01:13:24,479 --> 01:13:26,527
This is exactly what Kirk lions

1530
01:13:26,783 --> 01:13:29,855
Told the Aryan Nations World Congress in 1988

1531
01:13:30,367 --> 01:13:32,159
They're against that guy they're against us

1532
01:13:32,415 --> 01:13:33,695
Dissident voices

1533
01:13:33,951 --> 01:13:34,463
The Patriot

1534
01:13:34,975 --> 01:13:37,023
It's exactly the same rhetoric

1535
01:13:37,279 --> 01:13:38,559
There's being used as a Justice

1536
01:13:38,815 --> 01:13:39,583
Application for started

1537
01:13:39,839 --> 01:13:40,863
Patriots defense

1538
01:13:41,631 --> 01:13:42,655
Similarly

1539
01:13:42,911 --> 01:13:45,983
What you have in the

1540
01:13:46,239 --> 01:13:49,311
You know Louis William Luther pierce his letter

1541
01:13:50,591 --> 01:13:51,359
Kirk Lyon

1542
01:13:51,871 --> 01:13:54,687
The weenie he's going to help us create something

1543
01:13:54,943 --> 01:13:59,295
To help us in the same way the Jews have done for our enemy

1544
01:13:59,551 --> 01:14:03,903
Sure you know the have that same thing

1545
01:14:04,415 --> 01:14:06,719
What's the last

1546
01:14:06,975 --> 01:14:09,023
Four people were against

1547
01:14:09,279 --> 01:14:10,303
Yeah I'm that

1548
01:14:10,559 --> 01:14:13,631
I get that he's not saying the same thing

1549
01:14:14,143 --> 01:14:15,423
But the structure is the same

1550
01:14:15,935 --> 01:14:16,447
The argument

1551
01:14:17,983 --> 01:14:18,495
And

1552
01:14:19,519 --> 01:14:24,383
A lot of the people that seem to be adjacent to the world's that Barnes is swimming in our f*****-up

1553
01:14:24,895 --> 01:14:29,759
Stefan molyneux

1554
01:14:30,783 --> 01:14:32,063
Can't take the context

1555
01:14:32,575 --> 01:14:33,087
Out of

1556
01:14:33,343 --> 01:14:35,647
I can't hear this without thinking

1557
01:14:36,159 --> 01:14:37,183
Of Kirkland

1558
01:14:38,975 --> 01:14:40,511
The parallels are too strong

1559
01:14:40,767 --> 01:14:41,279
Right

1560
01:14:44,095 --> 01:14:47,935
To get back to our earlier conversation though was dealing with the

1561
01:14:48,191 --> 01:14:49,983
Founder of the area

1562
01:14:50,495 --> 01:14:51,519
And Barnes is dealing with

1563
01:14:51,775 --> 01:14:52,799
Cassandra Fairbanks Denali

1564
01:14:53,055 --> 01:14:53,567
Alex Jones you know what

1565
01:14:56,895 --> 01:14:59,455
Absolutely more I think it might be a smarter things

1566
01:14:59,711 --> 01:15:01,503
To do

1567
01:15:01,759 --> 01:15:02,783
She gives you weigh less

1568
01:15:03,295 --> 01:15:04,831
But give it give it more time

1569
01:15:05,599 --> 01:15:06,367
And who knows what it could be

1570
01:15:08,415 --> 01:15:11,999
Barnes decries

1571
01:15:12,511 --> 01:15:14,047
The downfall of the last

1572
01:15:14,815 --> 01:15:15,327
Lesbian

1573
01:15:16,095 --> 01:15:18,655
I don't know Noble or heroic or something

1574
01:15:21,727 --> 01:15:27,871
Enda reputational attack

1575
01:15:32,991 --> 01:15:36,063
With the giant corporations intact with the giant corporations

1576
01:15:36,319 --> 01:15:37,599
In media against

1577
01:15:38,111 --> 01:15:41,183
The little guy

1578
01:15:41,439 --> 01:15:42,975
Capacity to push back against

1579
01:15:44,255 --> 01:15:45,791
Absolutely isolated

1580
01:15:48,095 --> 01:15:48,607
Destination

1581
01:15:48,863 --> 01:15:50,143
Platforming is also happy

1582
01:15:50,655 --> 01:15:52,191
And people with your sort of ice

1583
01:15:54,495 --> 01:15:55,263
Trying to enforce

1584
01:15:55,519 --> 01:15:56,031
Orthodoxy

1585
01:15:59,871 --> 01:16:00,383
Indus Elsa

1586
01:16:01,151 --> 01:16:01,919
The most effective

1587
01:16:04,479 --> 01:16:10,623
Until he can get people afraid of man if I say that I might get sued I might lose my job I might coming

1588
01:16:13,183 --> 01:16:15,487
Who was just ain't working as they at a gas station

1589
01:16:16,255 --> 01:16:17,023
And he got fired

1590
01:16:19,583 --> 01:16:20,095
Trump

1591
01:16:20,351 --> 01:16:22,655
Customer credit

1592
01:16:23,423 --> 01:16:23,935
Ha

1593
01:16:24,447 --> 01:16:30,591
I don't know who the person Barnes is because the current cases section in the free America Law Center web

1594
01:16:30,847 --> 01:16:31,615
Website doesn't include them

1595
01:16:32,127 --> 01:16:33,663
The only cases listed are the coven

1596
01:16:33,919 --> 01:16:37,503
Two kids of former FBI agent representing and Alex Jones

1597
01:16:38,015 --> 01:16:39,039
Like I said Alex

1598
01:16:39,295 --> 01:16:42,367
Is not listed on the current roster of cases on barnes's website

1599
01:16:42,879 --> 01:16:43,903
Think it means

1600
01:16:44,927 --> 01:16:45,439
But we'll see

1601
01:16:46,207 --> 01:16:46,719
I'm guessing

1602
01:16:47,231 --> 01:16:51,839
The barn is the guy who worked at a gas station in Naperville

1603
01:16:52,095 --> 01:16:53,375
Just outside of Chicago

1604
01:16:53,631 --> 01:16:54,911
Who was just fired

1605
01:16:55,167 --> 01:16:55,679
Supporting Trump

1606
01:16:56,191 --> 01:16:59,519
This guy was caught on video questioning the citizenship status of a cup

1607
01:16:59,775 --> 01:17:01,311
And then telling her that people needed

1608
01:17:01,567 --> 01:17:03,103
Go back to their country

1609
01:17:03,615 --> 01:17:08,991
He tells the woman quote you're in the wrong country and as she's leaving threatens her quote will come

1610
01:17:09,503 --> 01:17:11,551
Which is a real cool indication

1611
01:17:13,855 --> 01:17:14,623
Stormtrooper Force

1612
01:17:14,879 --> 01:17:19,743
Bissell course was on the Hills right after Trump's whole centre-backs thing

1613
01:17:19,999 --> 01:17:20,767
So I guess

1614
01:17:21,279 --> 01:17:22,559
Kind of argue that there's a showings

1615
01:17:22,815 --> 01:17:24,607
Support for Trump

1616
01:17:24,863 --> 01:17:25,375
Retelling that he

1617
01:17:25,631 --> 01:17:26,911
He's reframing that as

1618
01:17:27,167 --> 01:17:33,311
Expressing a pro Trump position the real incident is a blatantly racist

1619
01:17:33,567 --> 01:17:37,663
Inoffensive interaction that's beyond the pale regardless of a person the political beliefs

1620
01:17:37,919 --> 01:17:39,455
I've managed retail outlets

1621
01:17:44,319 --> 01:17:44,831
Gone

1622
01:17:45,087 --> 01:17:48,415
Even if it wasn't about race even if it wasn't about her citizenship status

1623
01:17:48,927 --> 01:17:51,999
You don't get into fights with customers pure and simple

1624
01:17:52,511 --> 01:17:53,791
If you're a clerk at a gas station

1625
01:17:55,583 --> 01:17:58,399
Because someone who worked at multiple gas stations in my life

1626
01:17:58,655 --> 01:18:00,447
You're insanely replaceable

1627
01:18:00,703 --> 01:18:02,239
And no business should feel any need to

1628
01:18:03,007 --> 01:18:05,823
Guy who likes to argue with customers on the payroll

1629
01:18:07,871 --> 01:18:13,247
I'm not sure if this is the case of Barnes is talking about but I would kind of bet that it is based on the details that he provides

1630
01:18:13,503 --> 01:18:17,087
A video of the exchange between the clerk and customer went around on sofa

1631
01:18:17,343 --> 01:18:21,183
Commedia three plays into that part of barnes's platform

1632
01:18:21,695 --> 01:18:23,743
This is not a case of someone who's fired for supporting

1633
01:18:25,791 --> 01:18:29,887
But that's how racism it being a shity employee are whitewashed

1634
01:18:30,655 --> 01:18:31,679
If this really is

1635
01:18:31,935 --> 01:18:32,447
The case of Barnes

1636
01:18:32,703 --> 01:18:34,751
Let's talk about it clearly shows what is intention

1637
01:18:35,007 --> 01:18:35,519
Strategy

1638
01:18:35,775 --> 01:18:38,079
These are you take people like this to do

1639
01:18:38,335 --> 01:18:39,871
Blatantly intimidating race

1640
01:18:40,127 --> 01:18:40,639
This thing

1641
01:18:40,895 --> 01:18:41,919
And then you reframe

1642
01:18:42,175 --> 01:18:43,199
Repackage it

1643
01:18:43,711 --> 01:18:47,039
Some sort of a violation of the offenders right

1644
01:18:47,551 --> 01:18:50,111
And by virtue that you hope to come up the process

1645
01:18:50,623 --> 01:18:51,903
Or intimidate people

1646
01:18:52,159 --> 01:18:53,183
Out of

1647
01:18:53,695 --> 01:18:56,255
You know dealing with the disorder outburst

1648
01:18:57,023 --> 01:18:57,535
Rational

1649
01:19:00,095 --> 01:19:00,607
Like

1650
01:19:00,863 --> 01:19:01,375
Vicky

1651
01:19:01,631 --> 01:19:02,655
The person has

1652
01:19:02,911 --> 01:19:03,423
To have no

1653
01:19:04,191 --> 01:19:04,703
That Barn

1654
01:19:05,471 --> 01:19:05,983
Exploiting them for

1655
01:19:07,519 --> 01:19:09,055
Like the person who got fired

1656
01:19:09,311 --> 01:19:10,847
From the gas station

1657
01:19:11,359 --> 01:19:11,871
Do you think so

1658
01:19:12,127 --> 01:19:17,503
I don't know I don't know how this work that how that works as Barnes goes to

1659
01:19:17,759 --> 01:19:18,783
To them

1660
01:19:19,551 --> 01:19:20,319
Convince

1661
01:19:20,575 --> 01:19:21,343
Them that they have a key

1662
01:19:22,111 --> 01:19:22,623
And that

1663
01:19:22,879 --> 01:19:24,927
If they stick with Barnes they're going to wind up with

1664
01:19:25,183 --> 01:19:25,695
Winning a lot of money

1665
01:19:31,327 --> 01:19:34,143
Wow that's a good point I have no idea but I wouldn't

1666
01:19:34,399 --> 01:19:35,423
Surprised

1667
01:19:35,679 --> 01:19:36,959
It didn't seem strange

1668
01:19:37,471 --> 01:19:40,799
Prefer Barnes to reach out to him but I wouldn't I wouldn't

1669
01:19:41,055 --> 01:19:44,383
I don't I don't know how any of this stuff works I don't know anybody's expectation

1670
01:19:46,175 --> 01:19:47,199
We create

1671
01:19:47,455 --> 01:19:48,479
You're really sweet

1672
01:19:48,735 --> 01:19:51,295
We try to work on creating an atmosphere

1673
01:19:51,551 --> 01:19:53,343
Where are bigotry

1674
01:19:53,599 --> 01:19:54,879
Is legally

1675
01:19:55,391 --> 01:19:55,903
Defensible

1676
01:19:56,159 --> 01:20:00,511
Defendable to the point where people will resist pushing back on it

1677
01:20:00,767 --> 01:20:03,583
Yeah they want to create a fear of stepping up

1678
01:20:03,839 --> 01:20:05,119
To entreating

1679
01:20:06,143 --> 01:20:08,191
Publicly abusive racist outbursts

1680
01:20:09,983 --> 01:20:10,751
Actually

1681
01:20:11,263 --> 01:20:12,031
Protected speech

1682
01:20:12,287 --> 01:20:15,104
Absolutely

1683
01:20:15,872 --> 01:20:16,384
So

1684
01:20:16,640 --> 01:20:18,688
I just don't understand how the guy at the ascend

1685
01:20:19,456 --> 01:20:19,968
Doesn't realize that

1686
01:20:21,504 --> 01:20:22,016
Exploiting him

1687
01:20:22,272 --> 01:20:22,784
Completely

1688
01:20:23,040 --> 01:20:26,624
Like he's going to go home at the end at the end of all of this

1689
01:20:27,136 --> 01:20:28,416
He's going to go home with nothing

1690
01:20:28,672 --> 01:20:29,184
And having a

1691
01:20:29,952 --> 01:20:35,584
He might have more than he would otherwise what the f***

1692
01:20:35,840 --> 01:20:39,424
See if we can make a couple bucks off the fair the gas station chain

1693
01:20:39,936 --> 01:20:40,448
Fair

1694
01:20:40,960 --> 01:20:44,032
Do you threaten them enough you have

1695
01:20:44,288 --> 01:20:46,080
Intimidating enough lawyer

1696
01:20:46,336 --> 01:20:49,920
You might be able to make a settlement out of it

1697
01:20:55,808 --> 01:20:56,320
Ivysaur

1698
01:20:56,576 --> 01:20:57,088
Gas station

1699
01:20:57,344 --> 01:20:57,856
I was pretty dumb

1700
01:20:59,392 --> 01:21:02,976
Customer

1701
01:21:03,232 --> 01:21:03,744
I don't know

1702
01:21:04,256 --> 01:21:05,536
Because of all the

1703
01:21:06,048 --> 01:21:10,144
Because of the nature of what this organization really is geared towards

1704
01:21:10,912 --> 01:21:13,472
Stephane knows that like this is good

1705
01:21:13,984 --> 01:21:15,520
This is some momentum

1706
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:21,152
Well I obviously have somewhat of a personal motive in in supporting

1707
01:21:21,408 --> 01:21:26,784
Somebody ordered a trying to balance things like the splc which to me you know

1708
01:21:27,040 --> 01:21:28,576
Become a completely ideological

1709
01:21:30,112 --> 01:21:32,928
Battle Breakers

1710
01:21:33,184 --> 01:21:33,696
And me and

1711
01:21:33,952 --> 01:21:34,976
And other people who just

1712
01:21:35,232 --> 01:21:36,000
Make an argument

1713
01:21:43,424 --> 01:21:47,264
Any organization

1714
01:21:47,776 --> 01:21:50,592
Overtime

1715
01:21:50,848 --> 01:21:52,128
Collectivistic

1716
01:21:52,384 --> 01:21:52,896
Free market

1717
01:21:53,152 --> 01:21:53,920
Anti Freedom agenda

1718
01:22:00,320 --> 01:22:01,856
Having a counterweight to it

1719
01:22:02,112 --> 01:22:03,136
Think it's really important

1720
01:22:03,392 --> 01:22:04,160
Because

1721
01:22:09,024 --> 01:22:11,328
There are tons of counterweights already

1722
01:22:11,584 --> 01:22:14,912
If you think that they're not doing a good enough job

1723
01:22:15,424 --> 01:22:18,240
That's the conversation to have ever posted

1724
01:22:18,496 --> 01:22:19,008
Things don't exist

1725
01:22:20,032 --> 01:22:20,800
This

1726
01:22:21,056 --> 01:22:22,848
Is really an important distinction

1727
01:22:23,104 --> 01:22:23,616
To make

1728
01:22:23,872 --> 01:22:25,408
Because the way they framed

1729
01:22:25,920 --> 01:22:27,712
Is all like there is nothing

1730
01:22:28,224 --> 01:22:33,088
It's a wide-open Wilderness on the on the right side of public law

1731
01:22:33,344 --> 01:22:34,368
We need it because we

1732
01:22:34,880 --> 01:22:36,160
The Liberals have dominated

1733
01:22:37,696 --> 01:22:39,744
Their soup

1734
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:41,024
Superior Locker

1735
01:22:41,280 --> 01:22:43,328
Did laissez-faire

1736
01:22:43,584 --> 01:22:45,376
Absolutely not

1737
01:22:46,400 --> 01:22:47,168
It's dishonest

1738
01:22:47,424 --> 01:22:47,936
Bremen

1739
01:22:50,240 --> 01:22:50,752
It means

1740
01:22:51,008 --> 01:22:51,520
But you're up to some

1741
01:22:51,776 --> 01:22:52,544
General

1742
01:22:56,384 --> 01:22:57,664
I've asked this question I don't know how

1743
01:23:00,224 --> 01:23:02,016
Does he actually believe his own bulshit

1744
01:23:02,784 --> 01:23:04,064
Because what he just said

1745
01:23:04,320 --> 01:23:05,344
With sewn on

1746
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:06,368
Extensively

1747
01:23:07,648 --> 01:23:08,160
Just

1748
01:23:08,416 --> 01:23:09,696
Walmart

1749
01:23:10,208 --> 01:23:12,512
Everything

1750
01:23:13,280 --> 01:23:18,656
Except for his need for something like barnes's organization

1751
01:23:19,936 --> 01:23:20,960
Sentiment with gas

1752
01:23:21,472 --> 01:23:27,360
Well it's right

1753
01:23:27,616 --> 01:23:28,384
These people don't believe

1754
01:23:29,152 --> 01:23:33,248
So therefore it's a terrible organization taken over by globalist life dates then

1755
01:23:33,504 --> 01:23:36,832
Check collectivist agenda in far-left activist blah blah blah

1756
01:23:37,856 --> 01:23:38,880
FPL

1757
01:23:39,392 --> 01:23:41,440
You have like today watch out and like

1758
01:23:41,952 --> 01:23:48,096
They cover extremists on the right there are there one of the forces

1759
01:23:48,352 --> 01:23:49,120
Actually

1760
01:23:49,376 --> 01:23:50,144
Takes the time

1761
01:23:50,400 --> 01:23:54,496
And research is a lot of these people likes

1762
01:23:54,752 --> 01:23:56,800
Stefan molyneux don't get a pass from them

1763
01:23:58,848 --> 01:24:00,896
And declared himself

1764
01:24:01,152 --> 01:24:07,296
Like he is on the radar

1765
01:24:09,088 --> 01:24:10,880
It became a f****** weight National

1766
01:24:14,464 --> 01:24:15,744
The splc existed

1767
01:24:17,280 --> 01:24:18,048
Pasta

1768
01:24:18,304 --> 01:24:18,816
People who want

1769
01:24:22,912 --> 01:24:25,216
Prageru and me we're just having idea

1770
01:24:25,472 --> 01:24:26,752
F*** we just make argument

1771
01:24:27,008 --> 01:24:27,776
That's what I'm saying

1772
01:24:31,104 --> 01:24:31,872
So

1773
01:24:32,128 --> 01:24:32,896
But it's all the same

1774
01:24:34,432 --> 01:24:35,712
I just making arguments

1775
01:24:36,992 --> 01:24:40,064
It's the same

1776
01:24:40,320 --> 01:24:42,368
Similar to

1777
01:24:42,880 --> 01:24:43,392
This whole

1778
01:24:45,440 --> 01:24:46,464
Masquerading

1779
01:24:46,720 --> 01:24:47,744
What's really going on

1780
01:24:50,560 --> 01:24:52,352
Gas station person is just supporting Trump

1781
01:24:55,680 --> 01:24:58,240
It's a strategy that people like this

1782
01:24:58,496 --> 01:25:00,800
Right and it's essential to their ability to operate

1783
01:25:01,056 --> 01:25:03,360
Because Jose went around here like hey

1784
01:25:03,872 --> 01:25:04,640
I am going to

1785
01:25:05,664 --> 01:25:09,248
This guy who said a bunch of a customer

1786
01:25:09,504 --> 01:25:15,648
When he was working at a gas station and got fired because of it and I

1787
01:25:15,904 --> 01:25:20,256
Thrilled about minimum wage employees

1788
01:25:20,512 --> 01:25:22,816
Racist

1789
01:25:23,072 --> 01:25:25,120
That is the sort of thing that Society needs

1790
01:25:25,376 --> 01:25:29,472
No one giving money to that except for the really hardcore rapist

1791
01:25:30,752 --> 01:25:32,544
And that's not a big enough fool for you to run

1792
01:25:32,800 --> 01:25:33,824
A f****** Law Center with

1793
01:25:34,080 --> 01:25:36,896
Issue

1794
01:25:37,408 --> 01:25:38,432
You need to pretend that it's

1795
01:25:39,456 --> 01:25:42,528
The noble sensible Trump

1796
01:25:42,784 --> 01:25:43,296
Voter

1797
01:25:43,552 --> 01:25:44,320
Because that's a much

1798
01:25:44,576 --> 01:25:45,344
Larger audience

1799
01:25:45,600 --> 01:25:46,368
Dance from which to

1800
01:25:46,624 --> 01:25:47,392
Fish for donation

1801
01:25:47,648 --> 01:25:49,440
You masquerade thing

1802
01:25:49,696 --> 01:25:53,536
No one's going to be mad about Stephon just making argument

1803
01:25:57,120 --> 01:25:57,632
I hate him so much

1804
01:25:57,888 --> 01:26:00,448
You have to hide because you really do

1805
01:26:00,704 --> 01:26:01,728
Sincerely and honestly

1806
01:26:02,496 --> 01:26:04,032
Is a losing game

1807
01:26:04,288 --> 01:26:05,824
Which is why

1808
01:26:06,080 --> 01:26:06,848
Which is why they losing

1809
01:26:07,872 --> 01:26:08,896
Exactly

1810
01:26:09,408 --> 01:26:12,992
Positive

1811
01:26:13,248 --> 01:26:14,272
About Morris Dees

1812
01:26:14,528 --> 01:26:15,040
The

1813
01:26:15,296 --> 01:26:15,808
Founder

1814
01:26:16,064 --> 01:26:17,088
The Southern Poverty Law Center

1815
01:26:17,856 --> 01:26:18,880
Morris Dees in the time

1816
01:26:20,160 --> 01:26:20,928
The founder

1817
01:26:22,208 --> 01:26:22,720
Credit

1818
01:26:22,976 --> 01:26:24,000
He was originally started

1819
01:26:27,072 --> 01:26:27,584
Landmark

1820
01:26:28,608 --> 01:26:30,656
There was more money

1821
01:26:30,912 --> 01:26:31,680
If you suing the queen

1822
01:26:32,192 --> 01:26:33,472
It wasn't driven at an idiot

1823
01:26:34,496 --> 01:26:35,008
Anything else

1824
01:26:35,520 --> 01:26:38,336
What is that giving him credit for

1825
01:26:39,104 --> 01:26:41,920
I'll give him some credit it's still weird

1826
01:26:42,176 --> 01:26:42,944
Some credit goes to

1827
01:26:51,136 --> 01:26:51,648
Is it like

1828
01:26:52,928 --> 01:26:54,464
I don't understand what's being

1829
01:26:54,720 --> 01:26:57,792
Applauded because it could be that he was originally a client

1830
01:26:58,048 --> 01:26:59,072
Is that app I don't know

1831
01:26:59,328 --> 01:27:03,424
Is it that he's decided to start suing the clan is that what is a plot

1832
01:27:05,472 --> 01:27:07,008
Is it the fact that his decision

1833
01:27:07,264 --> 01:27:09,568
Baap Clan wasn't motivated

1834
01:27:09,824 --> 01:27:10,848
The clan just by a being

1835
01:27:11,360 --> 01:27:12,384
Financial consideration

1836
01:27:13,152 --> 01:27:14,432
None of the options seem good

1837
01:27:14,688 --> 01:27:16,224
All of them seem to be

1838
01:27:16,480 --> 01:27:17,248
Do you stocks

1839
01:27:17,504 --> 01:27:21,344
What is credit what really against the Klan uses following

1840
01:27:21,600 --> 01:27:23,392
Hey yeah basically what he

1841
01:27:23,648 --> 01:27:24,672
What he said

1842
01:27:25,696 --> 01:27:27,232
I think what he thought he was saying

1843
01:27:27,488 --> 01:27:28,512
Was that previously

1844
01:27:28,768 --> 01:27:29,280
He was

1845
01:27:29,536 --> 01:27:30,560
Non-ideological

1846
01:27:34,400 --> 01:27:34,912
Didn't pick

1847
01:27:36,448 --> 01:27:36,960
I guess

1848
01:27:37,472 --> 01:27:40,032
I don't know

1849
01:27:40,800 --> 01:27:41,312
That he was

1850
01:27:41,824 --> 01:27:42,336
He didn't pick

1851
01:27:48,736 --> 01:27:53,600
Where is Dee's is called the clan lawyer because in 1962 represented a klansman named Claude Henley

1852
01:27:53,856 --> 01:27:55,904
Who was on trial for attacking the Freedom Writers

1853
01:27:56,672 --> 01:27:57,184
He was 20

1854
01:27:57,440 --> 01:27:58,464
Pictures all the time and less than

1855
01:27:58,720 --> 01:28:01,792
For two years out of Law School

1856
01:28:02,048 --> 01:28:03,328
Any regrets taking that case

1857
01:28:04,096 --> 01:28:05,632
His subsequent legal history does

1858
01:28:06,656 --> 01:28:08,704
Sometime after the trial

1859
01:28:09,216 --> 01:28:11,776
As reflected by hit the cases that you took on

1860
01:28:12,032 --> 01:28:14,848
And the fact that he supported George Wallace his campaign

1861
01:28:15,104 --> 01:28:15,616
58

1862
01:28:15,872 --> 01:28:18,432
But by 1972 he was back in George McGovern

1863
01:28:19,456 --> 01:28:24,576
These objective antic Target for the right-wing because he's completely destroyed a lot of white supremacy

1864
01:28:25,856 --> 01:28:26,880
He's one large settlements

1865
01:28:27,136 --> 01:28:28,416
Against the white Aryan resistance

1866
01:28:28,672 --> 01:28:30,976
United klans of America and the Aryan Nation

1867
01:28:31,744 --> 01:28:34,560
People on the really f***** up parts of the right-wing do they can

1868
01:28:34,816 --> 01:28:36,096
Complain about him on the Merritt

1869
01:28:36,608 --> 01:28:40,448
Which is to say they can't just come out and say that they hate that he financially crippled white supremacist

1870
01:28:40,704 --> 01:28:42,752
This group's alternative Pro

1871
01:28:43,520 --> 01:28:44,800
You try to take his motive

1872
01:28:45,056 --> 01:28:48,128
You try to say you like

1873
01:28:49,664 --> 01:28:50,944
It's all an attempt

1874
01:28:51,200 --> 01:28:52,736
To attack without

1875
01:28:53,248 --> 01:28:54,528
Revealing why you're mad at him

1876
01:28:55,552 --> 01:28:56,576
What I think

1877
01:28:56,832 --> 01:29:01,952
Political work is very important

1878
01:29:02,208 --> 01:29:04,256
He was fired by the splc earlier this

1879
01:29:05,024 --> 01:29:06,816
Amedia suggested that it stems from it

1880
01:29:07,072 --> 01:29:07,584
Turtle harassed

1881
01:29:07,840 --> 01:29:08,352
Not complain

1882
01:29:10,912 --> 01:29:14,496
It certainly isn't from Barnes or Alex Randy's right-wing truth-tellers

1883
01:29:14,752 --> 01:29:16,544
It's from the f****** New York Times

1884
01:29:17,056 --> 01:29:21,408
The Bastion of liberal media the world

1885
01:29:21,664 --> 01:29:23,968
A world where the splc runs the show

1886
01:29:24,480 --> 01:29:27,552
Thick extensively covered the firing and all the employee

1887
01:29:27,808 --> 01:29:30,112
Complaints

1888
01:29:30,368 --> 01:29:32,928
Is the same his civil rights work is invalid

1889
01:29:33,184 --> 01:29:33,696
Claptrap

1890
01:29:33,952 --> 01:29:34,976
Don't b******* like

1891
01:29:35,232 --> 01:29:41,376
There are complaints about voice

1892
01:29:42,912 --> 01:29:43,936
Obvious plc

1893
01:29:44,192 --> 01:29:45,728
But the complaints that I hear out of

1894
01:29:46,240 --> 01:29:47,520
People is never that

1895
01:29:47,776 --> 01:29:48,288
Right

1896
01:29:48,544 --> 01:29:50,336
But at the same time they can

1897
01:29:51,104 --> 01:29:52,384
Talk about the legitimate

1898
01:29:53,408 --> 01:29:54,688
Cuz out of one side table

1899
01:29:54,944 --> 01:29:57,760
Look at how bad this guy is in the other side of them out there like

1900
01:29:58,272 --> 01:30:04,416
Employers should be able to do whatever they want that is a functional problem

1901
01:30:04,672 --> 01:30:06,208
Their other position

1902
01:30:06,464 --> 01:30:08,256
So it doesn't explicit Barnes

1903
01:30:08,512 --> 01:30:09,024
I think

1904
01:30:09,280 --> 01:30:10,048
Really sucks

1905
01:30:11,328 --> 01:30:13,888
90% of the people they list on their so-called hate water

1906
01:30:14,144 --> 01:30:14,912
Why not

1907
01:30:16,960 --> 01:30:17,472
They're awesome

1908
01:30:18,240 --> 01:30:19,520
Mainstream

1909
01:30:21,056 --> 01:30:22,080
Seattle

1910
01:30:24,896 --> 01:30:29,248
So I think the Barnes might have said be quiet

1911
01:30:29,504 --> 01:30:35,648
He claims that 1% of the people listed on the splc hate watch

1912
01:30:35,904 --> 01:30:39,232
Often within the political mainstream on the political right

1913
01:30:39,488 --> 01:30:40,256
Here are some of the most

1914
01:30:40,512 --> 01:30:41,024
Recent headlines

1915
01:30:41,280 --> 01:30:42,048
Saint hate watch

1916
01:30:42,816 --> 01:30:48,192
There's an article about the power struggle that's going on in the leadership of the anti-government militia

1917
01:30:48,704 --> 01:30:53,312
There's an article about women running for congress is really into calling groups

1918
01:30:53,568 --> 01:30:55,616
Muslim Sharia

1919
01:30:56,128 --> 01:30:58,432
There's a couple articles about Matthew cougarboard

1920
01:30:58,688 --> 01:31:02,528
Department officials active member of white nationalist group

1921
01:31:03,040 --> 01:31:05,856
There's an article about how many of the accelerationist elements

1922
01:31:06,112 --> 01:31:07,392
Sydney white supremacist community

1923
01:31:07,648 --> 01:31:10,464
We're responding to the El Paso shooting by emphasizing the need

1924
01:31:10,720 --> 01:31:12,000
To kill important people

1925
01:31:12,256 --> 01:31:13,792
Instead of random Folks at Walmart

1926
01:31:14,304 --> 01:31:18,144
There's an article about how a member of an Arkansas white nationalist group was arrested

1927
01:31:18,400 --> 01:31:19,680
For beating up a gay man because he

1928
01:31:19,936 --> 01:31:21,728
He was gay also had previous hate crime

1929
01:31:21,984 --> 01:31:22,752
Conviction to the Past

1930
01:31:23,264 --> 01:31:23,776
Legitimate

1931
01:31:24,288 --> 01:31:28,640
If you look at these articles and you think that's basically mainstream right-wing dissident voices

1932
01:31:28,896 --> 01:31:31,200
Your identifying the same problem I am

1933
01:31:31,712 --> 01:31:32,992
You don't think it's a problem

1934
01:31:34,016 --> 01:31:38,880
That's not good organization

1935
01:31:39,136 --> 01:31:40,416
Then you only brought up

1936
01:31:40,672 --> 01:31:41,952
You exam

1937
01:31:42,720 --> 01:31:45,792
See 90% of them are all of those

1938
01:31:46,048 --> 01:31:46,816
Groups are like

1939
01:31:47,328 --> 01:31:50,400
Americans for having a good time at places

1940
01:31:53,728 --> 01:31:56,032
Letter there in the political Maine

1941
01:31:56,288 --> 01:31:58,336
Stream right

1942
01:31:58,592 --> 01:32:00,896
Out of the country

1943
01:32:01,408 --> 01:32:02,432
Buddy there in the political

1944
01:32:04,736 --> 01:32:08,064
I guess Barnes could actually maybe be talkin about there

1945
01:32:08,320 --> 01:32:09,088
Extremist files

1946
01:32:09,344 --> 01:32:10,112
That section of the

1947
01:32:11,136 --> 01:32:14,208
Catchy name.

1948
01:32:14,464 --> 01:32:15,488
People remember

1949
01:32:18,816 --> 01:32:21,888
People listed in the extremophiles are really bad

1950
01:32:22,144 --> 01:32:22,656
Yeah

1951
01:32:22,912 --> 01:32:27,520
We could go through that list one by one and discuss how a lot of these people are either literal murders

1952
01:32:27,776 --> 01:32:29,056
Who killed people for white supremacy

1953
01:32:29,312 --> 01:32:31,360
Cicadas

1954
01:32:31,872 --> 01:32:33,920
Button to do is

1955
01:32:34,176 --> 01:32:34,944
I'd like to ask

1956
01:32:35,200 --> 01:32:35,712
Barnes think

1957
01:32:35,968 --> 01:32:40,832
Exactly are these 90% of people who are in the political mainstream on the right

1958
01:32:41,344 --> 01:32:43,392
That's the sort of thing that's really fun to say

1959
01:32:43,648 --> 01:32:46,720
Who plays really well with the right-wing persecution complex

1960
01:32:49,280 --> 01:32:54,144
But he's tacitly saying the mainstream of the right-wing has been overtaken by right white supremacist

1961
01:32:54,400 --> 01:32:54,912
In fashion

1962
01:32:57,728 --> 01:33:00,032
After Poland

1963
01:33:00,288 --> 01:33:04,128
Become a white nationalist

1964
01:33:05,408 --> 01:33:06,432
Really the word

1965
01:33:06,688 --> 01:33:07,968
Bubbled to the surface

1966
01:33:08,480 --> 01:33:10,272
It's probably a better way of foot

1967
01:33:10,784 --> 01:33:12,320
What was always there is

1968
01:33:12,576 --> 01:33:13,088
Just now allowed

1969
01:33:14,368 --> 01:33:16,672
I don't know I don't know if I wholly agree with you on that

1970
01:33:17,440 --> 01:33:18,464
That's an argument for another day

1971
01:33:19,232 --> 01:33:22,560
Barnes

1972
01:33:23,840 --> 01:33:24,864
Yeah the theory

1973
01:33:25,120 --> 01:33:25,888
About the media

1974
01:33:29,984 --> 01:33:30,496
The depiction

1975
01:33:31,776 --> 01:33:33,568
It also reminds me of what I said

1976
01:33:33,824 --> 01:33:34,336
Scholarships

1977
01:33:36,640 --> 01:33:37,408
Phenomenon

1978
01:33:37,664 --> 01:33:38,432
60 + 7

1979
01:33:38,944 --> 01:33:42,528
What particular groups tend to be demonized within the popular media

1980
01:33:43,040 --> 01:33:44,576
And back then

1981
01:33:44,832 --> 01:33:46,368
African America

1982
01:33:46,880 --> 01:33:47,648
Import White

1983
01:33:47,904 --> 01:33:48,672
Certain parts of the country

1984
01:33:49,184 --> 01:33:50,464
Kennedy portrayed

1985
01:33:50,720 --> 01:33:51,488
Fortunately

1986
01:33:51,744 --> 01:33:53,280
Dangerous and frightening way

1987
01:33:56,864 --> 01:33:58,400
Is that the beak

1988
01:33:59,424 --> 01:34:01,728
Take me to try to demonize those communities

1989
01:34:04,800 --> 01:34:05,568
Did whatever the establish

1990
01:34:05,824 --> 01:34:06,848
Panera

1991
01:34:07,360 --> 01:34:09,920
And so if you came from a community that reflected that

1992
01:34:10,944 --> 01:34:12,480
Popular

1993
01:34:12,736 --> 01:34:13,760
Cultural representation

1994
01:34:15,040 --> 01:34:16,576
Gifted

1995
01:34:17,856 --> 01:34:18,624
Whiteman

1996
01:34:18,880 --> 01:34:19,392
General

1997
01:34:19,648 --> 01:34:21,184
Also add Willy

1998
01:34:22,976 --> 01:34:25,280
Target even like I feel like big little lies when they

1999
01:34:25,536 --> 01:34:27,328
Yo would represent

2000
01:34:30,912 --> 01:34:34,240
Well

2001
01:34:35,008 --> 01:34:41,152
Other religions out there that that despite having some negative beliefs in general

2002
01:34:41,408 --> 01:34:42,688
Betrayed

2003
01:34:42,944 --> 01:34:43,968
With rapturous

2004
01:34:44,224 --> 01:34:45,504
Positivity like like

2005
01:34:45,760 --> 01:34:49,344
Somebody's either a member or a groupie

2006
01:34:49,856 --> 01:34:56,000
So I'm just trying to be coy with saying religious people at the fun

2007
01:35:04,960 --> 01:35:11,104
I didn't want to make it clear I wanted to leave a little air of vagueness that I talked about

2008
01:35:11,360 --> 01:35:16,736
Christian identity

2009
01:35:16,992 --> 01:35:18,016
Good call wink

2010
01:35:18,272 --> 01:35:20,064
Stefan molyneux is like

2011
01:35:24,416 --> 01:35:25,952
Buck

2012
01:35:26,208 --> 01:35:29,536
I've been through the fire and everyone knows I suck

2013
01:35:29,792 --> 01:35:35,424
Let's talk about f****** Christian Supremacy

2014
01:35:43,616 --> 01:35:45,920
Yeah that's f****** revealing too

2015
01:35:46,176 --> 01:35:46,944
Bb8

2016
01:35:47,200 --> 01:35:48,480
The idea that what he's pushing is

2017
01:35:48,736 --> 01:35:51,552
Glycol

2018
01:35:52,064 --> 01:35:54,112
Christian

2019
01:35:55,136 --> 01:35:57,440
I see what you doing can you imagine

2020
01:35:57,696 --> 01:35:58,464
Jinhao

2021
01:35:58,976 --> 01:36:01,024
Like imagine being able to tie Barnes

2022
01:36:03,584 --> 01:36:04,352
Pick 9th

2023
01:36:05,632 --> 01:36:07,680
I would love that

2024
01:36:07,936 --> 01:36:09,472
Pick out of all of those names

2025
01:36:09,728 --> 01:36:11,776
You give me 90% of them and wolf

2026
01:36:12,288 --> 01:36:14,336
Will f****** see who's in the political Maine

2027
01:36:14,592 --> 01:36:18,944
And if you still believe

2028
01:36:22,528 --> 01:36:24,064
Stefan molyneux podcast

2029
01:36:24,320 --> 01:36:27,136
Whatever

2030
01:36:27,392 --> 01:36:29,184
Snow White

2031
01:36:29,440 --> 01:36:30,208
The scrutiny it's just

2032
01:36:30,464 --> 01:36:33,792
Talk Hood narrative

2033
01:36:34,304 --> 01:36:35,072
He's a very

2034
01:36:36,096 --> 01:36:37,120
Marketable thing

2035
01:36:40,448 --> 01:36:40,960
No

2036
01:36:43,008 --> 01:36:44,544
Further down this

2037
01:36:45,824 --> 01:36:46,336
Slippery

2038
01:36:46,592 --> 01:36:50,944
Road at were on where it we learned that it's all about Christianity

2039
01:36:51,456 --> 01:36:51,968
White

2040
01:36:52,224 --> 01:36:52,992
Course

2041
01:36:53,248 --> 01:36:54,272
Barn starts talking about

2042
01:36:54,528 --> 01:36:55,296
The Covington case

2043
01:36:55,552 --> 01:36:56,320
But he's involved

2044
01:36:57,600 --> 01:36:58,368
Vicki said something

2045
01:36:58,624 --> 01:36:59,136
Things that aren't true

2046
01:37:00,160 --> 01:37:01,440
It was really a sub

2047
01:37:01,696 --> 01:37:02,208
Motivation

2048
01:37:02,720 --> 01:37:03,232
Chicken places

2049
01:37:03,488 --> 01:37:04,256
The Covington Chase

2050
01:37:04,512 --> 01:37:06,048
The message was what are these

2051
01:37:07,072 --> 01:37:08,608
That are successful at resisting

2052
01:37:08,864 --> 01:37:09,632
Sort of the elite

2053
01:37:11,936 --> 01:37:14,496
Entertainment and education that almost monopolize

2054
01:37:14,752 --> 01:37:15,520
Friday identity

2055
01:37:16,800 --> 01:37:17,312
Well that is place

2056
01:37:17,568 --> 01:37:18,080
Like really

2057
01:37:21,152 --> 01:37:21,664
Suppository

2058
01:37:21,920 --> 01:37:22,944
Independent

2059
01:37:23,712 --> 01:37:25,248
Establish

2060
01:37:25,504 --> 01:37:26,016
What's the narrative

2061
01:37:26,272 --> 01:37:26,784
In a widely

2062
01:37:30,112 --> 01:37:30,880
Catholic School

2063
01:37:31,136 --> 01:37:32,416
By trying to scare parents

2064
01:37:34,208 --> 01:37:34,976
McAfee School

2065
01:37:35,232 --> 01:37:37,280
Someday maybe then your time will ruin your life

2066
01:37:37,792 --> 01:37:38,816
Just because he really ghost

2067
01:37:39,072 --> 01:37:39,840
Catholic School

2068
01:37:40,096 --> 01:37:41,632
Affected

2069
01:37:42,144 --> 01:37:43,424
Time for planning on

2070
01:37:45,984 --> 01:37:47,776
Across the country wow

2071
01:37:48,032 --> 01:37:52,384
Wow writers for the New York Times

2072
01:37:52,640 --> 01:37:53,920
Stop

2073
01:37:54,432 --> 01:37:55,200
Again with her their

2074
01:37:57,504 --> 01:38:00,320
I'm pretty fast food fight

2075
01:38:02,880 --> 01:38:03,392
Education

2076
01:38:03,648 --> 01:38:08,768
I don't want to demonize it don't want to be one of the only places

2077
01:38:09,024 --> 01:38:09,536
Cuz we're like

2078
01:38:09,792 --> 01:38:11,840
Free thinking is is allowed

2079
01:38:12,096 --> 01:38:12,864
Strange

2080
01:38:13,120 --> 01:38:14,656
Because there's an overlay of religion

2081
01:38:14,912 --> 01:38:16,704
So-so

2082
01:38:17,216 --> 01:38:19,264
Barnes let me let me ask you a question

2083
01:38:19,776 --> 01:38:21,056
One of the

2084
01:38:21,568 --> 01:38:26,688
Strictest and most dogmatic places that you could ever get an education

2085
01:38:27,456 --> 01:38:29,248
Is the last Bastion for free

2086
01:38:29,760 --> 01:38:33,088
Sorry I completely forgot everything I've ever learned about Capo

2087
01:38:33,344 --> 01:38:34,624
Bookscool apologies

2088
01:38:36,416 --> 01:38:37,952
Not to be too blunt about this

2089
01:38:39,488 --> 01:38:40,512
Extremists

2090
01:38:41,024 --> 01:38:42,816
Presentation

2091
01:38:43,328 --> 01:38:47,680
Religious schools are the only place that give you a counter-narrative to the mainstream that

2092
01:38:47,936 --> 01:38:48,448
Trying to

2093
01:38:48,704 --> 01:38:51,776
Essentially trying to brainwash you and created collectivist

2094
01:38:52,032 --> 01:38:55,360
That dystopia where conservatives aren't allowed to say anything

2095
01:38:55,872 --> 01:38:59,712
Extremist

2096
01:38:59,968 --> 01:39:00,992
Physical kind of like

2097
01:39:01,504 --> 01:39:03,040
Matter-of-fact way that makes

2098
01:39:03,296 --> 01:39:03,808
It seemed like it

2099
01:39:04,064 --> 01:39:06,368
It's not as Extreme as it is this is insane

2100
01:39:06,624 --> 01:39:10,208
I'm still not be I'm still not able to draw this parallel that

2101
01:39:10,720 --> 01:39:11,232
Sorry about with lion

2102
01:39:11,488 --> 01:39:14,816
I don't see any similarities between that what

2103
01:39:15,072 --> 01:39:15,840
Whatsoever

2104
01:39:16,096 --> 01:39:16,608
Probably not

2105
01:39:17,120 --> 01:39:18,656
Barnes

2106
01:39:18,912 --> 01:39:19,424
It's just a lot

2107
01:39:20,448 --> 01:39:21,216
Dummy Jack Dorsey

2108
01:39:23,776 --> 01:39:25,312
Party

2109
01:39:25,568 --> 01:39:26,848
What is the biggest live

2110
01:39:29,152 --> 01:39:29,920
Because they become one of the

2111
01:39:32,224 --> 01:39:34,528
Forget what anybody goes to Twitter and tried to look up

2112
01:39:34,784 --> 01:39:35,808
Meet Barnes law

2113
01:39:36,064 --> 01:39:37,088
Sylvia

2114
01:39:37,600 --> 01:39:38,112
Unless they're already

2115
01:39:38,368 --> 01:39:39,904
I disappear

2116
01:39:40,672 --> 01:39:41,696
Saudi

2117
01:39:41,952 --> 01:39:42,720
I just finally they took

2118
01:39:44,512 --> 01:39:45,536
I did

2119
01:39:46,048 --> 01:39:46,816
Follow Barn

2120
01:39:47,840 --> 01:39:50,656
How long did it take you to find the first name that pops up to

2121
01:39:50,912 --> 01:39:54,496
Google Robert Barnes Barnes law

2122
01:39:54,752 --> 01:39:56,800
You forgot that you weren't connect

2123
01:39:57,056 --> 01:39:57,824
Did to Wi-Fi

2124
01:39:58,080 --> 01:40:02,688
Then it might take a little longer might be harder to find it that's if that's possible

2125
01:40:02,944 --> 01:40:09,088
Absolutely

2126
01:40:09,344 --> 01:40:12,672
Now what's interesting about that is the argument

2127
01:40:12,928 --> 01:40:14,208
It proves the opposite

2128
01:40:14,720 --> 01:40:15,744
Because you saying that

2129
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:20,608
I can't be found on Twitter I'll maybe they're mad at me cuz I took some of your time

2130
01:40:20,864 --> 01:40:22,912
MSU time

2131
01:40:23,168 --> 01:40:25,728
That only serves to reinforce

2132
01:40:25,984 --> 01:40:27,264
B Twitter is not

2133
01:40:27,520 --> 01:40:30,080
Vindictively attacking you in anyway

2134
01:40:30,336 --> 01:40:33,664
I could still find it Twitter

2135
01:40:35,200 --> 01:40:36,736
It is not difficult

2136
01:40:37,248 --> 01:40:40,320
He's someone who if Jack was a petulant person news

2137
01:40:40,576 --> 01:40:43,904
Capriciously Rakim

2138
01:40:44,160 --> 01:40:45,952
Yeah you would be number one

2139
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:49,024
Also he could

2140
01:40:51,072 --> 01:40:51,584
Sure

2141
01:40:54,144 --> 01:40:58,496
I do like him being like

2142
01:40:59,520 --> 01:41:00,544
And now I'm about to

2143
01:41:00,800 --> 01:41:02,080
Coppell one bigger

2144
01:41:02,336 --> 01:41:03,872
I don't think it's

2145
01:41:04,128 --> 01:41:07,968
Bigger butt like I would say how I would look at Jack statement

2146
01:41:08,480 --> 01:41:08,992
More like

2147
01:41:09,248 --> 01:41:14,368
I bet he meant that when he said it was the goal

2148
01:41:14,624 --> 01:41:18,720
It was not a Isaac you're starting

2149
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:20,512
Start up

2150
01:41:21,024 --> 01:41:26,144
You probably have a really different idea of what it is

2151
01:41:26,400 --> 01:41:27,424
Millions of users

2152
01:41:28,448 --> 01:41:33,056
Isaac changed the complexion of

2153
01:41:33,312 --> 01:41:35,104
With Twitter like working

2154
01:41:35,360 --> 01:41:39,712
Speech all over the place right what's the logistics of what

2155
01:41:39,968 --> 01:41:41,760
How people are going to abuse

2156
01:41:43,296 --> 01:41:45,088
Start to become real

2157
01:41:45,344 --> 01:41:48,416
You can't live up to the the goals you set out for yourself

2158
01:41:48,672 --> 01:41:49,184
Puppy outside

2159
01:41:49,440 --> 01:41:50,208
Yes I'll probably

2160
01:41:50,720 --> 01:41:53,024
Stating an idea and then failing

2161
01:41:53,280 --> 01:41:53,792
To live up to

2162
01:41:54,560 --> 01:41:56,096
For any number of Circa

2163
01:41:56,864 --> 01:41:57,376
Does not

2164
01:41:57,632 --> 01:41:59,424
Me and you are lying about your ID

2165
01:41:59,936 --> 01:42:01,216
Bright Eyes

2166
01:42:01,472 --> 01:42:04,032
Deserves criticism

2167
01:42:04,288 --> 01:42:10,432
I don't think it's

2168
01:42:12,992 --> 01:42:15,552
Actual malice which is a problem

2169
01:42:15,808 --> 01:42:16,832
We're going to get rid of it

2170
01:42:18,880 --> 01:42:22,464
Christian paranoia here in

2171
01:42:22,976 --> 01:42:24,000
Sponsor

2172
01:42:24,256 --> 01:42:24,768
Stuff that's just

2173
01:42:25,024 --> 01:42:25,792
Way out of line

2174
01:42:26,560 --> 01:42:27,584
Why is it all the best

2175
01:42:27,840 --> 01:42:30,144
Deliverance your kind of redneck

2176
01:42:33,216 --> 01:42:38,848
Coastal Elite The General

2177
01:42:39,104 --> 01:42:42,432
What countries

2178
01:42:43,968 --> 01:42:48,832
What when you put a

2179
01:42:49,088 --> 01:42:51,392
Historically has stood between

2180
01:42:51,648 --> 01:42:52,928
Galactus collectible

2181
01:42:53,440 --> 01:42:57,280
And straight out of the French

2182
01:42:57,536 --> 01:43:02,656
Revolution posting they did was kill the priest that killed someone

2183
01:43:03,168 --> 01:43:05,216
So there is those who seek power

2184
01:43:05,472 --> 01:43:10,592
Have a great deal of

2185
01:43:18,528 --> 01:43:24,672
And so warm

2186
01:43:26,720 --> 01:43:28,256
Christian's Libertarians and so on

2187
01:43:28,768 --> 01:43:34,144
Anniyan and others end

2188
01:43:34,400 --> 01:43:37,216
Between the predators in the power AC

2189
01:43:37,472 --> 01:43:43,616
At people like that

2190
01:43:47,200 --> 01:43:48,992
Okay why do you agree with that

2191
01:43:54,880 --> 01:43:56,416
100% volume

2192
01:43:56,672 --> 01:43:59,488
Yeah the phone was on a bit of a rash was stupid

2193
01:43:59,744 --> 01:44:03,072
Yeah somebody tells me that Stefan molyneux is smart

2194
01:44:03,328 --> 01:44:03,840
I think

2195
01:44:05,120 --> 01:44:06,656
In some ways yes

2196
01:44:06,912 --> 01:44:08,960
Somebody who knows

2197
01:44:09,216 --> 01:44:09,728
Elvish

2198
01:44:09,984 --> 01:44:10,496
Is good at

2199
01:44:11,008 --> 01:44:14,848
You know Larry absolutely you're smart

2200
01:44:15,616 --> 01:44:16,128
That's

2201
01:44:16,640 --> 01:44:21,760
You're living in a fictitious World ice skating in Lord of the Rings world you are a f******

2202
01:44:22,016 --> 01:44:25,088
Genius Stephen molyneux in the real world

2203
01:44:25,344 --> 01:44:26,112
You're an idiot

2204
01:44:27,648 --> 01:44:33,280
By my earlier comments about him being really smart it is much as like he has

2205
01:44:34,048 --> 01:44:38,912
High level of mental processing power

2206
01:44:39,424 --> 01:44:40,704
Functionally

2207
01:44:40,960 --> 01:44:43,520
Technically smart but functionally an idiot

2208
01:44:44,032 --> 01:44:46,848
What kind of Elvis thing works

2209
01:44:47,104 --> 01:44:51,456
We don't need to spend a lot of time rehashing her Christianity

2210
01:44:51,712 --> 01:44:53,760
He served as an excuse and immoral rationalization for

2211
01:44:54,016 --> 01:44:54,528
Colonialism

2212
01:44:54,784 --> 01:45:00,160
Anna. Where countless indigenous peoples were massacred and had their lands taken from them and their resources

2213
01:45:00,416 --> 01:45:03,232
Ripple effects that still played much of the world today

2214
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:05,536
I don't know how to find to find

2215
01:45:05,792 --> 01:45:06,560
Purity or pressure

2216
01:45:06,816 --> 01:45:08,864
But if it doesn't include Experian

2217
01:45:09,120 --> 01:45:10,656
He's talking about something else

2218
01:45:11,936 --> 01:45:17,056
When you look around the world and you try and figure out who some of the major not good folks are

2219
01:45:17,568 --> 01:45:18,336
He kind of got the sense

2220
01:45:18,848 --> 01:45:21,152
Stefan's notion that Christianity is somehow resistant

2221
01:45:21,408 --> 01:45:22,944
Just a depression is like

2222
01:45:23,200 --> 01:45:23,712
Complete bulshit

2223
01:45:23,968 --> 01:45:24,480
Nonsense

2224
01:45:24,736 --> 01:45:27,296
Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orban is a Christian

2225
01:45:27,552 --> 01:45:33,696
Religious stuff lately in the Philippines is identified

2226
01:45:34,464 --> 01:45:39,840
These guys complain all day about South Africa but their president

2227
01:45:40,096 --> 01:45:43,168
Slobodan milosevic was a Christian and that dude's face charges

2228
01:45:43,424 --> 01:45:44,960
Crimes against humanity

2229
01:45:46,496 --> 01:45:49,312
There plenty of world leaders who are up-to-no-good who are Christian

2230
01:45:49,568 --> 01:45:50,848
But beating up on Christianity

2231
01:45:51,104 --> 01:45:51,616
Isn't the point

2232
01:45:52,384 --> 01:45:53,920
Their leaders of all religious persuasion

2233
01:45:54,176 --> 01:45:54,944
To do bad things

2234
01:45:55,200 --> 01:45:58,272
Goleta country's downtown

2235
01:45:58,528 --> 01:45:59,040
Religion

2236
01:46:00,064 --> 01:46:02,880
When you completely ignore that this is an unrelated variable

2237
01:46:03,392 --> 01:46:07,488
Continue to lionize Christianity demean other religions based on that false

2238
01:46:07,744 --> 01:46:12,352
It really demonstrates

2239
01:46:12,864 --> 01:46:14,400
It's more that your soft pitching

2240
01:46:14,656 --> 01:46:15,936
A social theocracy

2241
01:46:16,192 --> 01:46:16,704
Dan

2242
01:46:16,960 --> 01:46:17,472
Do you know what is

2243
01:46:17,728 --> 01:46:20,032
Is real tyranny but the Muslims

2244
01:46:20,544 --> 01:46:21,568
In Jerusalem

2245
01:46:21,824 --> 01:46:27,200
In 1080 that was real tyranny because they wouldn't just let the British

2246
01:46:27,456 --> 01:46:28,736
Thousands of miles away

2247
01:46:28,992 --> 01:46:29,504
Have it

2248
01:46:30,016 --> 01:46:31,040
I think they would

2249
01:46:31,296 --> 01:46:32,832
Keira Knightley

2250
01:46:35,136 --> 01:46:38,464
The more a Christian anxiety you're coming up in

2251
01:46:40,256 --> 01:46:40,768
Look at the Nike

2252
01:46:41,024 --> 01:46:42,048
30 communist model

2253
01:46:42,560 --> 01:46:43,328
You're trying to rap

2254
01:46:44,608 --> 01:46:45,632
Which is getting bought like

2255
01:46:47,680 --> 01:46:48,448
Apartments apart of

2256
01:46:49,728 --> 01:46:50,496
Infiltrate

2257
01:46:51,520 --> 01:46:52,288
Appreciate people

2258
01:46:52,544 --> 01:46:53,056
. process

2259
01:46:53,568 --> 01:46:56,640
Get all of that they mostly been wildly

2260
01:46:58,176 --> 01:47:00,992
Ezequiel Ramos

2261
01:47:01,248 --> 01:47:02,016
In the United States

2262
01:47:02,528 --> 01:47:03,808
Almost out of them religious

2263
01:47:04,064 --> 01:47:04,576
Parochial School

2264
01:47:06,624 --> 01:47:07,648
Controller

2265
01:47:07,904 --> 01:47:08,672
TV and Hollywood

2266
01:47:08,928 --> 01:47:09,696
Major books

2267
01:47:09,952 --> 01:47:10,976
Elmo

2268
01:47:11,744 --> 01:47:13,280
With the sole exception

2269
01:47:13,536 --> 01:47:14,560
Really being the church

2270
01:47:14,816 --> 01:47:15,840
Is the last ripassa

2271
01:47:16,096 --> 01:47:17,120
Story of traditional beliefs

2272
01:47:18,400 --> 01:47:19,168
Their status

2273
01:47:19,424 --> 01:47:20,448
And sort of

2274
01:47:20,704 --> 01:47:21,984
Revolutionary mindset

2275
01:47:24,544 --> 01:47:25,568
It's one that attacked

2276
01:47:25,824 --> 01:47:26,336
Prediction

2277
01:47:26,592 --> 01:47:27,360
Tax ideas

2278
01:47:27,872 --> 01:47:28,896
Because of their Association

2279
01:47:30,176 --> 01:47:30,944
Warwick

2280
01:47:31,200 --> 01:47:32,224
Expedition

2281
01:47:32,736 --> 01:47:33,248
Christian religion

2282
01:47:33,504 --> 01:47:35,808
Because they see them as their biggest

2283
01:47:37,600 --> 01:47:38,368
Diesel

2284
01:47:38,880 --> 01:47:39,904
We could get rid of churches

2285
01:47:40,416 --> 01:47:41,184
Like the county

2286
01:47:41,952 --> 01:47:44,000
To do in the 1930s in places like Russia

2287
01:47:46,048 --> 01:47:46,560
Parsley

2288
01:47:47,840 --> 01:47:48,352
The best way to

2289
01:47:52,192 --> 01:47:52,960
Perceive the world

2290
01:47:53,472 --> 01:47:55,264
Ain't nobody trying to get rid of churches

2291
01:47:58,080 --> 01:48:04,224
Are we adding Catholicism is are they adding Catholicism

2292
01:48:04,480 --> 01:48:07,552
People who used to murder Catholics for the very active

2293
01:48:07,808 --> 01:48:10,624
Right there from that ideological

2294
01:48:13,184 --> 01:48:16,768
Willy-nilly

2295
01:48:17,280 --> 01:48:23,424
Growth

2296
01:48:23,680 --> 01:48:29,824
Used to have a great time alienated Catholic but now I still hate the Pope

2297
01:48:30,080 --> 01:48:36,224
Netflix

2298
01:48:36,480 --> 01:48:38,016
The pope is still a demon

2299
01:48:38,272 --> 01:48:39,040
These people are so f*****

2300
01:48:39,296 --> 01:48:41,344
Being stupid why is it that they get to destroy the world

2301
01:48:41,856 --> 01:48:42,368
I don't know

2302
01:48:44,160 --> 01:48:46,464
Won't work now this is

2303
01:48:46,720 --> 01:48:47,488
Turn now

2304
01:48:47,744 --> 01:48:50,304
Like this episode conversation

2305
01:48:50,560 --> 01:48:52,096
Stephon is having with Robert Barn

2306
01:48:52,352 --> 01:48:53,632
Has turned towards

2307
01:48:53,888 --> 01:48:54,912
Be natural

2308
01:48:55,168 --> 01:48:56,192
Place that it was

2309
01:48:58,496 --> 01:49:01,056
Okay I'm expressing that be

2310
01:49:01,568 --> 01:49:02,336
Are the threats

2311
01:49:02,592 --> 01:49:03,872
Against white identity

2312
01:49:04,128 --> 01:49:08,480
And Christianity that I'm going to focus on with my

2313
01:49:09,504 --> 01:49:13,344
All I want at least that's my guiding principles

2314
01:49:13,856 --> 01:49:14,624
I'm going

2315
01:49:14,880 --> 01:49:15,904
To be like

2316
01:49:16,672 --> 01:49:18,464
The guy who you go to

2317
01:49:18,720 --> 01:49:20,000
Whenever you

2318
01:49:20,256 --> 01:49:24,352
Like infringe on a gay person and you feel like you should have

2319
01:49:25,632 --> 01:49:27,168
Pro straight white male

2320
01:49:27,424 --> 01:49:27,936
Yeah

2321
01:49:28,448 --> 01:49:28,960
First

2322
01:49:29,216 --> 01:49:29,984
Prologue

2323
01:49:34,336 --> 01:49:37,152
And you can hear by how much this turns into a like

2324
01:49:37,920 --> 01:49:41,760
Christianity is the only thing that matters is the last bulwark against

2325
01:49:42,016 --> 01:49:42,784
Terranea

2326
01:49:43,808 --> 01:49:44,320
Alright man

2327
01:49:45,088 --> 01:49:48,416
So they get into some real stupid territory

2328
01:49:48,672 --> 01:49:49,440
After

2329
01:49:50,208 --> 01:49:52,000
But it's still within this

2330
01:49:52,256 --> 01:49:56,608
This dissertation that's going on about how Christianity is under attack

2331
01:49:57,376 --> 01:49:58,912
And tap man

2332
01:49:59,168 --> 01:49:59,680
Philly

2333
01:50:02,240 --> 01:50:03,264
Pedophilia

2334
01:50:06,080 --> 01:50:07,872
The Catholic Church

2335
01:50:09,152 --> 01:50:09,664
Hollywood

2336
01:50:09,920 --> 01:50:10,944
But only one

2337
01:50:11,200 --> 01:50:11,712
Has been sent

2338
01:50:14,528 --> 01:50:15,040
Recovered

2339
01:50:19,392 --> 01:50:20,416
Civil suit in criminal case

2340
01:50:20,928 --> 01:50:22,464
If in the churches in the

2341
01:50:23,232 --> 01:50:25,792
That's absurd

2342
01:50:26,048 --> 01:50:27,840
Steel focus on Hollywood

2343
01:50:28,096 --> 01:50:29,376
Now I would argue

2344
01:50:30,144 --> 01:50:33,472
They're one of the reasons that the Hollywood stuff is been a little bit more difficult

2345
01:50:34,240 --> 01:50:37,056
Is the people who come from the same places

2346
01:50:37,312 --> 01:50:38,080
Has Robert Barnes

2347
01:50:38,336 --> 01:50:40,896
Maybe write for similar Publications

2348
01:50:43,712 --> 01:50:44,480
Panic sing

2349
01:50:44,736 --> 01:50:46,272
There's a lot of distraction

2350
01:50:46,784 --> 01:50:52,672
With the pizza world that is taken away from any kind of

2351
01:50:52,928 --> 01:50:53,440
Real

2352
01:50:53,696 --> 01:50:54,208
Focus

2353
01:50:54,464 --> 01:50:56,000
Distraction

2354
01:50:56,256 --> 01:50:56,768
The create

2355
01:50:57,024 --> 01:50:59,328
Expectations that can't be lived up to

2356
01:50:59,584 --> 01:51:02,400
Yeah the creates a false version

2357
01:51:02,656 --> 01:51:05,216
That makes it look like real investigations recovery

2358
01:51:06,240 --> 01:51:08,032
That isn't the media's fault

2359
01:51:08,544 --> 01:51:09,824
That's your side's fault

2360
01:51:10,336 --> 01:51:12,384
That's Alex and his associates full

2361
01:51:13,152 --> 01:51:15,712
That is something that you will never be able to achieve

2362
01:51:16,224 --> 01:51:18,016
The idea that everybody is involved

2363
01:51:20,576 --> 01:51:22,112
Blood-drinking

2364
01:51:22,368 --> 01:51:23,392
Child sacrifice

2365
01:51:23,648 --> 01:51:24,160
Party

2366
01:51:24,672 --> 01:51:26,976
Is not something you're going to ever prove

2367
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:31,840
Add because you can't you'll always look at it as like well they never really got to the bottom of

2368
01:51:32,352 --> 01:51:34,656
And you know what they do with the Catholic Church

2369
01:51:35,424 --> 01:51:37,216
The only one

2370
01:51:37,472 --> 01:51:39,008
Not about protecting kids

2371
01:51:39,264 --> 01:51:41,056
It's about attacking Christianity

2372
01:51:44,896 --> 01:51:45,408
Very

2373
01:51:48,480 --> 01:51:49,248
For especially

2374
01:51:52,320 --> 01:51:52,832
Cuz there's a

2375
01:51:53,344 --> 01:51:54,624
Griffin I mean Griff

2376
01:51:54,880 --> 01:51:55,392
About

2377
01:51:56,416 --> 01:51:56,928
The Catholic Church

2378
01:51:58,208 --> 01:51:59,232
Measurable number of

2379
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:00,512
Is over

2380
01:52:01,792 --> 01:52:02,304
Comprehend

2381
01:52:03,584 --> 01:52:05,632
Yeah I not least of which

2382
01:52:05,888 --> 01:52:06,400
Because

2383
01:52:06,912 --> 01:52:09,216
That's not a thing that can be

2384
01:52:09,728 --> 01:52:10,496
Partisan

2385
01:52:11,520 --> 01:52:12,288
You can't do that

2386
01:52:13,312 --> 01:52:13,824
Directions

2387
01:52:16,640 --> 01:52:18,176
What are you talkin about

2388
01:52:18,432 --> 01:52:19,968
White religious people

2389
01:52:21,248 --> 01:52:23,296
Georgia

2390
01:52:23,552 --> 01:52:24,832
It doesn't make any sense for me

2391
01:52:25,088 --> 01:52:25,600
Nope

2392
01:52:25,856 --> 01:52:27,904
So if you wanted to make less than

2393
01:52:28,416 --> 01:52:33,024
Robert Barnes here has a an example of something that shows

2394
01:52:33,280 --> 01:52:34,048
The distinction

2395
01:52:34,304 --> 01:52:35,584
Between how people react

2396
01:52:35,840 --> 01:52:36,864
Hollywood

2397
01:52:37,120 --> 01:52:38,656
AMC the priest

2398
01:52:39,424 --> 01:52:40,192
In the Catholic Church

2399
01:52:40,960 --> 01:52:43,008
And I would say this is one of the more ludicrous compare

2400
01:52:44,288 --> 01:52:45,312
Try to reinstate

2401
01:52:46,336 --> 01:52:47,104
White

2402
01:52:47,360 --> 01:52:47,872
Death record

2403
01:52:51,200 --> 01:52:53,248
Appropriate

2404
01:52:53,504 --> 01:52:54,272
If you think

2405
01:52:55,296 --> 01:52:56,576
Saudi amazing dynamic

2406
01:52:57,344 --> 01:52:57,856
Buena Park

2407
01:52:59,136 --> 01:53:01,184
Revealed that their true agenda

2408
01:53:03,232 --> 01:53:05,280
What if God was a Catholic

2409
01:53:06,048 --> 01:53:11,168
Eddie took to Twitter to make horrible jokes

2410
01:53:11,424 --> 01:53:12,704
That's his smoking gun rights

2411
01:53:12,960 --> 01:53:13,728
I mean

2412
01:53:13,984 --> 01:53:14,752
It's a little weak

2413
01:53:15,008 --> 01:53:15,520
That is

2414
01:53:15,776 --> 01:53:16,288
That is

2415
01:53:16,544 --> 01:53:17,568
Dumbo

2416
01:53:21,408 --> 01:53:27,552
I have ever had work Barnes

2417
01:53:27,808 --> 01:53:30,624
We would have been treated differently if he was a f******

2418
01:53:30,880 --> 01:53:31,392
Priest

2419
01:53:31,648 --> 01:53:32,672
Greg Barnes

2420
01:53:33,696 --> 01:53:38,560
Gun situation

2421
01:53:39,072 --> 01:53:41,632
Is kind of analogous analogous

2422
01:53:41,888 --> 01:53:42,400
Because

2423
01:53:42,656 --> 01:53:44,704
No one is ever had like a priest

2424
01:53:44,960 --> 01:53:45,728
Did the Catholic Church

2425
01:53:47,776 --> 01:53:48,288
Thing f*****-up

2426
01:53:48,544 --> 01:53:50,592
Right that's not been the case

2427
01:53:51,104 --> 01:53:52,640
You can't really draw parallels

2428
01:53:52,896 --> 01:53:54,432
Between them you show me that

2429
01:53:54,688 --> 01:53:55,712
The Catholic priest

2430
01:53:55,968 --> 01:53:57,504
Repeat something I really f***** up

2431
01:53:57,760 --> 01:53:59,296
And then we'll talk

2432
01:53:59,552 --> 01:54:01,344
Then we'll talk about how the reaction.

2433
01:54:01,600 --> 01:54:03,136
You know what also lets

2434
01:54:03,392 --> 01:54:05,440
Show me not just the Catholic priests who f***** up

2435
01:54:05,696 --> 01:54:06,208
Intuitive sense

2436
01:54:06,464 --> 01:54:11,328
Weird but the Catholic priest who f***** up and tweeted something 10 years ago that was Unearthed

2437
01:54:11,584 --> 01:54:12,864
Dubai a right-wing suck

2438
01:54:13,120 --> 01:54:14,400
King lunatic a****** trying to

2439
01:54:15,936 --> 01:54:17,216
OK Google

2440
01:54:17,472 --> 01:54:18,496
Control operator

2441
01:54:19,008 --> 01:54:20,288
Then blown out of proportion

2442
01:54:22,848 --> 01:54:24,640
Fair enough

2443
01:54:24,896 --> 01:54:28,224
Situation then we can gauge reactions and how they're different

2444
01:54:28,736 --> 01:54:29,760
So I born

2445
01:54:30,016 --> 01:54:30,528
Believes

2446
01:54:30,784 --> 01:54:32,064
Some interesting things about

2447
01:54:32,320 --> 01:54:32,832
The First Amendment

2448
01:54:34,368 --> 01:54:35,648
Get rid of it no

2449
01:54:36,160 --> 01:54:39,232
Before it but he has a slightly different interpretation of it

2450
01:54:39,488 --> 01:54:40,000
Most people

2451
01:54:41,024 --> 01:54:41,792
Big Meech

2452
01:54:42,048 --> 01:54:42,816
Big fat

2453
01:54:46,144 --> 01:54:46,656
Target certain

2454
01:54:47,168 --> 01:54:48,704
Really slowly because of

2455
01:54:49,216 --> 01:54:49,984
To suppress

2456
01:54:50,240 --> 01:54:50,752
Concentra

2457
01:54:51,008 --> 01:54:51,776
Thought

2458
01:54:53,824 --> 01:54:55,104
Stalking

2459
01:54:55,360 --> 01:54:56,640
Audience

2460
01:54:58,688 --> 01:54:59,456
Really all about

2461
01:54:59,968 --> 01:55:01,248
Protecting the audience's right

2462
01:55:01,760 --> 01:55:02,528
Introspective

2463
01:55:02,784 --> 01:55:03,296
The audience

2464
01:55:03,552 --> 01:55:04,320
Rational

2465
01:55:06,880 --> 01:55:07,392
Their morale

2466
01:55:07,648 --> 01:55:08,928
Capacity

2467
01:55:12,000 --> 01:55:12,768
It doesn't trust

2468
01:55:13,024 --> 01:55:13,792
The ordinary person

2469
01:55:15,584 --> 01:55:16,352
Ability of thought

2470
01:55:16,608 --> 01:55:17,120
Conscience

2471
01:55:17,376 --> 01:55:17,888
Processing

2472
01:55:18,144 --> 01:55:18,656
Information

2473
01:55:18,912 --> 01:55:19,936
Mick Gordon Wyatt

2474
01:55:20,448 --> 01:55:20,960
That's why they have

2475
01:55:23,008 --> 01:55:25,056
So he believes it appears

2476
01:55:25,312 --> 01:55:27,872
That the first time I met a titles you to an audio

2477
01:55:28,384 --> 01:55:30,432
Which is absurd

2478
01:55:31,712 --> 01:55:32,992
Crazy it's the right

2479
01:55:33,248 --> 01:55:35,808
You're infringing on the rights of the audience right

2480
01:55:36,320 --> 01:55:37,600
Which I am and of course

2481
01:55:37,856 --> 01:55:42,208
Entitled to right like if you use the Alex Jones example the audience

2482
01:55:42,464 --> 01:55:43,232
Isn't affected Alex

2483
01:55:43,488 --> 01:55:44,256
You can still find wherever

2484
01:55:45,024 --> 01:55:46,816
So even under his

2485
01:55:47,072 --> 01:55:49,120
Broad definition of the first appointment

2486
01:55:49,376 --> 01:55:55,264
Alex is not being impressed at all he has his website you can still find his s*** wherever you want

2487
01:55:56,544 --> 01:55:57,056
Like

2488
01:55:57,312 --> 01:55:58,592
Florence doesn't respect

2489
01:55:59,360 --> 01:55:59,872
The audience

2490
01:56:00,128 --> 01:56:00,896
To go out

2491
01:56:01,152 --> 01:56:01,664
And find it

2492
01:56:01,920 --> 01:56:03,712
On their own wow interesting

2493
01:56:03,968 --> 01:56:05,248
It don't look like barns

2494
01:56:05,504 --> 01:56:07,040
This is the one who disrespects his

2495
01:56:07,296 --> 01:56:07,808
Is audience

2496
01:56:08,064 --> 01:56:09,344
By saying that their apps

2497
01:56:09,600 --> 01:56:11,136
Absolutely incapable of Googling

2498
01:56:11,392 --> 01:56:12,160
Alex Jones

2499
01:56:12,416 --> 01:56:13,440
Infowars.com

2500
01:56:13,696 --> 01:56:19,584
The other problem that I have is the audience

2501
01:56:19,840 --> 01:56:21,888
To make a decision here these things

2502
01:56:22,144 --> 01:56:22,912
To make a decision

2503
01:56:23,168 --> 01:56:26,496
But you know the classic example of

2504
01:56:26,752 --> 01:56:28,288
You can't yell fire in a crowded building

2505
01:56:28,800 --> 01:56:32,128
Write his version of it would be

2506
01:56:32,384 --> 01:56:32,896
Because

2507
01:56:33,152 --> 01:56:39,296
If you get in trouble for yelling fire in a crowded building what you're doing is you're not trusting the other people in that building to make a sound

2508
01:56:39,552 --> 01:56:45,696
Moral decision about whether or not there's a fire

2509
01:56:45,952 --> 01:56:46,976
Capable of knowing

2510
01:56:47,488 --> 01:56:48,768
Instantaneously

2511
01:56:49,024 --> 01:56:50,304
When hearing fire

2512
01:56:50,816 --> 01:56:56,960
Whether or not there is or is not a fire.

2513
01:56:58,752 --> 01:57:02,592
Disrespect to the people in that theater

2514
01:57:03,104 --> 01:57:07,456
If you get the person at

2515
01:57:07,968 --> 01:57:08,480
Trick

2516
01:57:08,736 --> 01:57:11,808
Hundreds of people into doing something silly I don't

2517
01:57:13,088 --> 01:57:13,856
Putting on

2518
01:57:14,368 --> 01:57:15,648
People is absurd

2519
01:57:19,232 --> 01:57:20,256
Even know how to describe it it's

2520
01:57:20,512 --> 01:57:21,024
You're such a

2521
01:57:21,280 --> 01:57:22,048
Strange way to look

2522
01:57:23,328 --> 01:57:29,216
It is such a fascinating it doesn't matter what I do you must respond

2523
01:57:30,240 --> 01:57:34,848
It's such an also the fire in a crowded theater thing is a really interesting a noun

2524
01:57:35,360 --> 01:57:36,128
When you

2525
01:57:36,384 --> 01:57:37,408
Actually

2526
01:57:40,224 --> 01:57:42,528
In a way I don't trust

2527
01:57:43,040 --> 01:57:43,808
These people

2528
01:57:44,320 --> 01:57:45,088
Instant react

2529
01:57:45,600 --> 01:57:46,112
To this guy

2530
01:57:46,368 --> 01:57:46,880
A screaming fight

2531
01:57:47,648 --> 01:57:48,160
Because

2532
01:57:48,672 --> 01:57:50,464
That guy could be a bad actor

2533
01:57:50,976 --> 01:57:52,512
He could be a bad faith actor

2534
01:57:53,024 --> 01:57:53,536
And in

2535
01:57:54,560 --> 01:57:55,072
Split Second

2536
01:57:55,584 --> 01:57:56,352
He is

2537
01:57:57,376 --> 01:57:59,424
Influencing your emotional Behavior

2538
01:57:59,680 --> 01:58:01,984
Bypassing your rational thought process

2539
01:58:02,496 --> 01:58:03,520
And

2540
01:58:03,776 --> 01:58:05,824
In influencing you react in the weather today

2541
01:58:06,080 --> 01:58:06,592
Detrimental

2542
01:58:06,848 --> 01:58:07,872
Do your own bed

2543
01:58:10,944 --> 01:58:13,248
And that's what he's doing

2544
01:58:13,504 --> 01:58:19,136
Well it's on you to make a rational decision or whatever

2545
01:58:19,392 --> 01:58:21,952
Are you to disagree with me

2546
01:58:22,464 --> 01:58:26,816
I don't necessarily agree

2547
01:58:27,328 --> 01:58:27,840
Specific suit

2548
01:58:28,864 --> 01:58:29,632
Barnes hats

2549
01:58:29,888 --> 01:58:31,424
Real stupid

2550
01:58:31,936 --> 01:58:34,752
His main argument seems to be that this is like a

2551
01:58:35,008 --> 01:58:36,544
Focused attack

2552
01:58:36,800 --> 01:58:40,384
Using Alex as an example because what they're doing is there deplatforming

2553
01:58:40,896 --> 01:58:42,432
And that also defaming him

2554
01:58:42,688 --> 01:58:47,552
He's not able to respond because he's been to

2555
01:58:47,808 --> 01:58:48,320
The platform

2556
01:58:48,832 --> 01:58:49,344
This is

2557
01:58:49,600 --> 01:58:50,112
Silly

2558
01:58:50,368 --> 01:58:53,440
And I know it's silly because of the examples that he

2559
01:58:53,696 --> 01:58:54,208
He uses

2560
01:58:54,976 --> 01:58:56,256
But they're doing parallel

2561
01:59:00,352 --> 01:59:01,888
They're not only when they

2562
01:59:02,400 --> 01:59:02,912
Enterprise

2563
01:59:07,264 --> 01:59:08,288
The water right

2564
01:59:09,312 --> 01:59:10,080
Craziest way

2565
01:59:12,128 --> 01:59:12,640
Completely

2566
01:59:12,896 --> 01:59:13,920
Cities in California

2567
01:59:15,456 --> 01:59:18,272
Cities in California to lawyers totally Fallen

2568
01:59:25,696 --> 01:59:26,464
Instead lied about

2569
01:59:33,120 --> 01:59:34,400
Take me where I go Estrella Court

2570
01:59:34,912 --> 01:59:39,008
They were unopened

2571
01:59:39,520 --> 01:59:42,336
Email account

2572
01:59:42,592 --> 01:59:45,408
If I understand correctly

2573
01:59:45,920 --> 01:59:50,784
But this was not

2574
01:59:53,600 --> 01:59:54,624
Here's the thing

2575
01:59:54,880 --> 01:59:56,672
You know how Stefano's these things

2576
01:59:56,928 --> 01:59:58,464
Because it was f****** reported

2577
01:59:58,720 --> 02:00:04,864
The Lakers this is like no one was reporting the story that Alex sent these people c********* for the shitz and giggles

2578
02:00:05,120 --> 02:00:11,264
Get that information Insider information

2579
02:00:11,520 --> 02:00:17,664
If you're complaining about people misunderstanding the story that was correctly reported in New York

2580
02:00:18,176 --> 02:00:23,040
That I don't know what to do I don't know what to do for you your complaint is the people on Twitter dumb

2581
02:00:24,576 --> 02:00:25,600
Yes

2582
02:00:25,856 --> 02:00:26,880
Is the case

2583
02:00:27,136 --> 02:00:30,720
Is doing

2584
02:00:31,232 --> 02:00:32,000
As

2585
02:00:32,512 --> 02:00:34,048
Robert is presenting

2586
02:00:34,560 --> 02:00:38,400
They're presenting the idea that the media lied about this situated

2587
02:00:38,656 --> 02:00:39,424
And that does not

2588
02:00:39,680 --> 02:00:41,728
True I've read a bunch of Arctic

2589
02:00:41,984 --> 02:00:43,008
About that situation

2590
02:00:43,264 --> 02:00:44,800
Because we had to cover it on this show

2591
02:00:45,056 --> 02:00:46,080
All of them

2592
02:00:46,336 --> 02:00:48,384
We're clear about

2593
02:00:48,640 --> 02:00:51,456
They were the FBI had been involved

2594
02:00:51,712 --> 02:00:56,576
And had said that it does not appear that Alex was aware of it these were on open

2595
02:00:56,832 --> 02:00:59,392
There was no culpability that was assigned to Alex Jones

2596
02:01:01,952 --> 02:01:05,024
I don't even know if this isn't any of the articles are just what I took away from it

2597
02:01:05,280 --> 02:01:07,072
The criticism that could be launched

2598
02:01:07,328 --> 02:01:07,840
Is

2599
02:01:08,096 --> 02:01:11,168
How the f*** did he not look at what he was turning over to Discovery

2600
02:01:11,424 --> 02:01:16,032
Is the sort of criticism

2601
02:01:16,800 --> 02:01:17,568
That is

2602
02:01:17,824 --> 02:01:19,360
What could be taken from it

2603
02:01:19,872 --> 02:01:21,664
If you want to talk about the interpretations

2604
02:01:21,920 --> 02:01:23,200
The people could have of

2605
02:01:24,992 --> 02:01:25,760
DD

2606
02:01:26,272 --> 02:01:30,112
With whatever someone might walk away from it if they didn't read the whole article

2607
02:01:30,368 --> 02:01:32,416
Well then you're just talking about Alex's business model

2608
02:01:32,672 --> 02:01:33,952
So almost like your

2609
02:01:34,720 --> 02:01:36,512
Not trusting the audience

2610
02:01:37,024 --> 02:01:37,792
To read the

2611
02:01:38,048 --> 02:01:38,560
Tire art

2612
02:01:41,888 --> 02:01:43,168
Infringing upon their free speech

2613
02:01:45,216 --> 02:01:50,592
Will hear of like Alex being defamed and platform

2614
02:01:52,128 --> 02:01:54,688
Got the reports that I've read were very clear about the

2615
02:01:54,944 --> 02:01:55,456
Situation

2616
02:01:55,968 --> 02:01:57,248
And if you want

2617
02:01:59,552 --> 02:02:00,832
Need to sue those people

2618
02:02:02,624 --> 02:02:03,392
It doesn't matter

2619
02:02:04,672 --> 02:02:05,952
Anyway

2620
02:02:06,208 --> 02:02:06,976
I love

2621
02:02:09,536 --> 02:02:10,560
Like it's so stupid

2622
02:02:10,816 --> 02:02:11,328
For him to be like

2623
02:02:11,840 --> 02:02:16,448
And know if there's no way

2624
02:02:16,704 --> 02:02:20,544
Silence them so there's no way that that information

2625
02:02:20,800 --> 02:02:21,312
Okay

2626
02:02:23,104 --> 02:02:25,152
Let me repeat back to you exactly what I read

2627
02:02:25,408 --> 02:02:26,944
Quoting from the wash right

2628
02:02:27,200 --> 02:02:32,576
Information reporting

2629
02:02:33,344 --> 02:02:34,624
Sostuto stupid

2630
02:02:34,880 --> 02:02:35,648
So there's other lies

2631
02:02:35,904 --> 02:02:36,928
The media's defamed hour

2632
02:02:37,184 --> 02:02:37,696
Facts about sharks

2633
02:02:38,976 --> 02:02:39,744
Lost the lawsuit

2634
02:02:42,048 --> 02:02:43,072
A book that has nothing to do with

2635
02:02:43,584 --> 02:02:46,656
Head anti-semitic statements

2636
02:02:46,912 --> 02:02:47,424
He made a rap

2637
02:02:47,680 --> 02:02:48,960
A white shoe

2638
02:02:49,216 --> 02:02:50,752
Lawyer

2639
02:02:56,640 --> 02:03:00,992
Search lawsuit in writing the book no one died at Sandy Hook

2640
02:03:01,248 --> 02:03:04,320
MarketWatch

2641
02:03:05,344 --> 02:03:06,368
We've discussed this already

2642
02:03:06,624 --> 02:03:07,648
And now it should be right to

2643
02:03:07,904 --> 02:03:08,416
To get in touch with them

2644
02:03:08,672 --> 02:03:09,440
Insist they retract

2645
02:03:09,696 --> 02:03:10,208
Can apologize

2646
02:03:10,720 --> 02:03:16,864
However

2647
02:03:17,120 --> 02:03:17,632
The APU

2648
02:03:20,448 --> 02:03:23,264
And this is because they didn't write it and didn't publish it

2649
02:03:23,520 --> 02:03:25,056
A completely different website did

2650
02:03:25,568 --> 02:03:31,712
This is what I was his grandstanding about suing the Associated Press about early in the episode which is never going to fly

2651
02:03:31,968 --> 02:03:33,248
Knows that this is the Publix

2652
02:03:33,504 --> 02:03:35,040
Nice. You can tell because there's a

2653
02:03:35,296 --> 02:03:37,088
The clear problem they did real

2654
02:03:37,600 --> 02:03:39,136
And they're attacking the straw man

2655
02:03:39,392 --> 02:03:45,536
Yep the problem is super easy to resolve all you have to do is contact MarketWatch and if they refuse to correct it then you sue them

2656
02:03:46,304 --> 02:03:48,608
All you do is focus on the Associated Press

2657
02:03:48,864 --> 02:03:52,192
You're not interested in the correction you're not interested in the real problem

2658
02:03:52,448 --> 02:03:55,776
You're interested in pretending the largest news Outlet in the United States

2659
02:03:56,032 --> 02:03:56,544
To slandering

2660
02:03:57,056 --> 02:04:00,384
And the real reason to do that is to elevate and exaggerate your own Vicks

2661
02:04:01,408 --> 02:04:02,176
Mark my words

2662
02:04:02,688 --> 02:04:04,224
That lawsuit will never happen

2663
02:04:04,736 --> 02:04:10,880
Because any lawyer Alex could possibly have would know that if you thrown out immediately and possibly even open up

2664
02:04:11,904 --> 02:04:12,416
Refine

2665
02:04:12,672 --> 02:04:15,488
For a frivolous or malicious filing of a suit

2666
02:04:15,744 --> 02:04:17,024
It's absolutely ridiculous

2667
02:04:17,280 --> 02:04:18,048
Not if

2668
02:04:18,304 --> 02:04:19,328
You are a

2669
02:04:19,584 --> 02:04:20,352
Working for the

2670
02:04:20,608 --> 02:04:21,632
Free America lost

2671
02:04:21,888 --> 02:04:22,400
Center that lost

2672
02:04:23,680 --> 02:04:25,984
I don't know I still think even Barnes with no like this

2673
02:04:26,240 --> 02:04:26,752
Opens up

2674
02:04:27,008 --> 02:04:28,032
Potential

2675
02:04:28,288 --> 02:04:29,568
That's why I hired

2676
02:04:30,592 --> 02:04:31,616
You're sure

2677
02:04:31,872 --> 02:04:36,992
I was always against the reading of Alex's words as jewboy

2678
02:04:37,248 --> 02:04:39,808
But also really drunk when he say

2679
02:04:40,064 --> 02:04:40,832
Said that anyway

2680
02:04:41,088 --> 02:04:41,600
Caulking

2681
02:04:41,856 --> 02:04:43,136
Super unclearly in that ran

2682
02:04:43,648 --> 02:04:45,184
I can totally understand how someone could

2683
02:04:45,440 --> 02:04:46,720
Could hear jewboy in there

2684
02:04:46,976 --> 02:04:48,512
But I think if you're familiar

2685
02:04:48,768 --> 02:04:50,560
His career in style

2686
02:04:50,816 --> 02:04:51,840
Throw around stuff like that

2687
02:04:52,352 --> 02:04:57,472
He has decades under his belt walking a very fine line and even he's aware that calling someone jewboy

2688
02:04:57,728 --> 02:05:00,800
Is going to raise more questions about his rhetoric that he wants sex

2689
02:05:01,312 --> 02:05:03,104
That's one of those things where

2690
02:05:03,360 --> 02:05:04,896
I was

2691
02:05:06,432 --> 02:05:08,992
I understand why people would think him being drunk

2692
02:05:09,504 --> 02:05:10,528
More likely to

2693
02:05:10,784 --> 02:05:11,296
To throw out

2694
02:05:13,600 --> 02:05:15,392
But at the same time

2695
02:05:16,160 --> 02:05:17,440
Black performing wise

2696
02:05:18,208 --> 02:05:18,720
There

2697
02:05:19,232 --> 02:05:21,280
I don't know why I thought

2698
02:05:22,048 --> 02:05:22,816
Almost

2699
02:05:24,096 --> 02:05:24,864
Across-the-board bud

2700
02:05:25,120 --> 02:05:26,912
There's a certain amount of muscle memory that

2701
02:05:27,168 --> 02:05:27,936
Takes over even if you're

2702
02:05:29,472 --> 02:05:30,240
I've been

2703
02:05:30,496 --> 02:05:31,520
Drunk before

2704
02:05:31,776 --> 02:05:33,312
And then I walk up on stage

2705
02:05:33,568 --> 02:05:35,104
And do the same set that I normally do

2706
02:05:36,128 --> 02:05:37,408
It's just it's just muscle

2707
02:05:38,176 --> 02:05:38,944
And then you walked

2708
02:05:41,760 --> 02:05:43,040
Which is why I don't

2709
02:05:43,552 --> 02:05:44,576
Think that even if Alex is

2710
02:05:44,832 --> 02:05:45,344
Is really drunk

2711
02:05:45,600 --> 02:05:46,112
He's going to

2712
02:05:46,368 --> 02:05:46,880
You forget

2713
02:05:47,136 --> 02:05:48,672
All of those performance

2714
02:05:49,184 --> 02:05:49,696
Things

2715
02:05:49,952 --> 02:05:54,816
You know the difference between autopilot or whatever the performance

2716
02:05:55,328 --> 02:05:56,608
Spade

2717
02:05:56,864 --> 02:05:57,888
Dealing with chaos

2718
02:05:58,144 --> 02:05:58,912
While you're performing

2719
02:05:59,424 --> 02:06:04,032
Like if you started getting heckled you might end up the drunkenness might come back

2720
02:06:04,288 --> 02:06:05,056
Possible

2721
02:06:06,848 --> 02:06:08,128
I don't know if that works

2722
02:06:08,384 --> 02:06:11,200
As well as it might feel like it for Alex's

2723
02:06:11,456 --> 02:06:12,224
Drunken ranting

2724
02:06:12,480 --> 02:06:14,784
But I still even like in his intoxicated

2725
02:06:15,040 --> 02:06:16,832
It's a I still do I think he knows better

2726
02:06:17,344 --> 02:06:19,392
He's very used to knowing

2727
02:06:19,648 --> 02:06:21,440
Where approximate lines are

2728
02:06:21,696 --> 02:06:26,304
He test those lines before he crosses them a lot of the time

2729
02:06:26,816 --> 02:06:30,400
There's a lot of calling everybody else actors before he jumps in

2730
02:06:30,656 --> 02:06:32,704
And starts doing the actress.

2731
02:06:32,960 --> 02:06:34,240
That testing align

2732
02:06:34,496 --> 02:06:37,312
That's like telling up to it and seeing how it feels

2733
02:06:37,824 --> 02:06:38,592
Before he commits to

2734
02:06:39,104 --> 02:06:40,640
He would never just drunkenly

2735
02:06:41,152 --> 02:06:42,688
You got yelled this guy's a Jew boy

2736
02:06:42,944 --> 02:06:47,040
I just don't feel like it's in his character even if there is a ton of

2737
02:06:47,296 --> 02:06:47,808
Semitism

2738
02:06:48,064 --> 02:06:49,344
It is worldview

2739
02:06:50,112 --> 02:06:50,880
I just don't think it makes sense

2740
02:06:51,392 --> 02:06:52,416
The transcript

2741
02:06:52,672 --> 02:06:54,976
Plaintiff

2742
02:06:55,232 --> 02:06:56,512
But even critics

2743
02:06:56,768 --> 02:06:59,328
Like will summer

2744
02:06:59,840 --> 02:07:03,424
My overall feeling about this is that the transcription folks were incorrect

2745
02:07:03,680 --> 02:07:05,728
But I don't think it came from a place of malice

2746
02:07:05,984 --> 02:07:06,752
They're trying to defame out

2747
02:07:07,520 --> 02:07:08,032
I think Alex

2748
02:07:08,288 --> 02:07:09,056
Who's f****** wasted

2749
02:07:09,312 --> 02:07:10,080
Screaming about the plane

2750
02:07:10,336 --> 02:07:12,384
Million-dollar bounty on his head

2751
02:07:12,896 --> 02:07:14,176
Do bees eat

2752
02:07:14,432 --> 02:07:15,456
Mistake

2753
02:07:15,712 --> 02:07:18,272
In the transcription if you're not really all that familiar with Alex

2754
02:07:19,040 --> 02:07:20,064
Especially considering

2755
02:07:20,320 --> 02:07:21,600
White shoes

2756
02:07:21,856 --> 02:07:22,624
The super well-known

2757
02:07:22,880 --> 02:07:23,392
Interim

2758
02:07:23,648 --> 02:07:27,232
That's not a slang insult that gets thrown around by most people

2759
02:07:27,744 --> 02:07:30,816
So I don't know if it's on the tip of a lot of people's tongues

2760
02:07:31,072 --> 02:07:32,608
Yeah so you're doing transcript

2761
02:07:34,400 --> 02:07:35,680
He's drunk he's kind of flirting

2762
02:07:35,936 --> 02:07:37,984
You don't know what white shoe boy means

2763
02:07:38,752 --> 02:07:40,800
Cuz why would you write I still don't know what

2764
02:07:41,312 --> 02:07:43,360
It means like a Ivy League

2765
02:07:43,616 --> 02:07:44,384
Upper Crust

2766
02:07:44,640 --> 02:07:45,408
Kind of

2767
02:07:46,944 --> 02:07:47,456
Richie

2768
02:07:47,712 --> 02:07:50,016
So anyway we get back to Barnes

2769
02:07:50,272 --> 02:07:51,296
Defending the Alex

2770
02:07:51,552 --> 02:07:52,832
The court of public opinion

2771
02:07:53,088 --> 02:07:54,624
If you well on Stefan molyneux

2772
02:07:55,904 --> 02:07:56,416
So he is

2773
02:07:56,672 --> 02:07:58,208
Spear for lost

2774
02:07:58,720 --> 02:08:00,768
As the victim in Target of big media

2775
02:08:01,024 --> 02:08:02,048
Big Tech solution

2776
02:08:02,560 --> 02:08:03,072
To be able to

2777
02:08:05,120 --> 02:08:06,400
And the reason is because

2778
02:08:06,912 --> 02:08:08,960
Independent

2779
02:08:11,776 --> 02:08:12,288
Independent

2780
02:08:12,544 --> 02:08:13,056
Perspective

2781
02:08:14,336 --> 02:08:16,128
Protective

2782
02:08:17,408 --> 02:08:17,920
Anywhere else

2783
02:08:18,176 --> 02:08:19,456
Imma get information I don't hear

2784
02:08:21,248 --> 02:08:22,528
Should have the power in Detroit

2785
02:08:22,784 --> 02:08:23,552
Decide whether

2786
02:08:24,832 --> 02:08:25,856
Whether I like it or no

2787
02:08:27,648 --> 02:08:33,792
Scott to a 10-hour Montage italics

2788
02:08:34,048 --> 02:08:39,936
With

2789
02:08:40,192 --> 02:08:43,520
Yeah I love this idea that

2790
02:08:44,032 --> 02:08:45,568
Package Alex as this Lake

2791
02:08:46,336 --> 02:08:49,152
Rogue Independent Media guy who's

2792
02:08:49,920 --> 02:08:50,944
Get the f*** out of here

2793
02:08:51,456 --> 02:08:51,968
I don't like

2794
02:08:52,224 --> 02:08:52,736
Is is

2795
02:08:53,504 --> 02:08:55,040
I don't know obviously

2796
02:08:55,296 --> 02:08:55,808
Because I'm not in

2797
02:08:56,064 --> 02:08:56,576
Legal Circle

2798
02:08:57,344 --> 02:08:58,112
Is lawfare

2799
02:08:58,368 --> 02:08:58,880
Thrown around

2800
02:09:02,464 --> 02:09:02,976
Looking a

2801
02:09:03,488 --> 02:09:04,768
Cuz I'm not

2802
02:09:05,280 --> 02:09:05,792
Let's

2803
02:09:06,048 --> 02:09:12,192
That's not how you know what is the word that Barnes uses a lot and I've noticed from listening to a bit of him that he's also

2804
02:09:12,448 --> 02:09:13,472
One of these guys who likes to

2805
02:09:13,728 --> 02:09:17,056
Speaking alliteration and rhyme

2806
02:09:17,568 --> 02:09:20,896
He says lies and labels all the f****** time

2807
02:09:21,152 --> 02:09:23,456
Whatever he says either word it's

2808
02:09:23,968 --> 02:09:26,528
That kind of

2809
02:09:27,040 --> 02:09:28,320
Aggressive

2810
02:09:31,136 --> 02:09:37,280
Everything is okay

2811
02:09:37,536 --> 02:09:38,560
Fairy should be law War

2812
02:09:38,816 --> 02:09:40,864
Instead Infowars

2813
02:09:42,912 --> 02:09:46,240
Grandiose

2814
02:09:46,496 --> 02:09:48,032
About to Alex's struggle

2815
02:09:50,848 --> 02:09:52,128
I've been proud to be a car.

2816
02:09:52,640 --> 02:09:54,176
Try to defend Alex Jones

2817
02:09:55,712 --> 02:09:58,016
Legal actions of all time

2818
02:09:58,528 --> 02:09:59,296
To ascertain

2819
02:09:59,552 --> 02:10:00,320
Free speech and free

2820
02:10:00,576 --> 02:10:01,088
Presrite

2821
02:10:01,600 --> 02:10:03,392
Been behind them

2822
02:10:05,952 --> 02:10:06,464
The future

2823
02:10:06,976 --> 02:10:07,488
Free speech

2824
02:10:07,744 --> 02:10:11,584
Free Press in America

2825
02:10:11,840 --> 02:10:13,632
And that's why it's so important

2826
02:10:13,888 --> 02:10:14,912
City of the best represent

2827
02:10:15,680 --> 02:10:16,448
The best legal I can

2828
02:10:16,704 --> 02:10:17,728
Bates the best defense

2829
02:10:17,984 --> 02:10:19,520
Because ultimately

2830
02:10:19,776 --> 02:10:20,544
We are outside

2831
02:10:21,056 --> 02:10:24,128
Alex

2832
02:10:24,640 --> 02:10:25,920
NFL C-TEC big media

2833
02:10:28,480 --> 02:10:29,760
I would say okay

2834
02:10:30,016 --> 02:10:31,296
I would say

2835
02:10:32,832 --> 02:10:34,880
I don't think there's anything wrong with

2836
02:10:35,136 --> 02:10:37,696
Mediatek treating me like Alex drone

2837
02:10:43,072 --> 02:10:44,864
See how getting the consequences

2838
02:10:45,120 --> 02:10:46,400
If you can

2839
02:10:46,656 --> 02:10:48,960
If I directly inspired

2840
02:10:49,216 --> 02:10:52,032
Harassment to go on for years and years and years

2841
02:10:52,288 --> 02:10:52,800
I think I would be

2842
02:10:54,336 --> 02:10:55,360
If there's somebody was like

2843
02:10:56,128 --> 02:10:57,664
Yeah you're going to need to be punished

2844
02:11:03,808 --> 02:11:07,136
He's lucky that there's not a hundred more

2845
02:11:07,904 --> 02:11:08,416
Cuz

2846
02:11:08,672 --> 02:11:12,256
Hit his his style is broadcast what he does

2847
02:11:12,768 --> 02:11:13,280
Large

2848
02:11:13,792 --> 02:11:14,816
Depends on

2849
02:11:16,864 --> 02:11:17,632
Like he's just

2850
02:11:17,888 --> 02:11:20,192
Straight up constantly lying about people

2851
02:11:21,728 --> 02:11:27,104
That's a good boy

2852
02:11:30,176 --> 02:11:30,688
I guess I can try

2853
02:11:33,248 --> 02:11:37,856
I think it when I look at all this is a large cent

2854
02:11:38,880 --> 02:11:39,392
Suspicion

2855
02:11:41,952 --> 02:11:42,720
I don't think

2856
02:11:42,976 --> 02:11:43,744
It's even possible

2857
02:11:44,000 --> 02:11:44,512
At this point

2858
02:11:44,768 --> 02:11:46,304
To know what barnes's game is

2859
02:11:47,072 --> 02:11:48,864
But Victor strong indications

2860
02:11:49,120 --> 02:11:50,144
That you know

2861
02:11:50,656 --> 02:11:52,704
He's done some Marquee cases

2862
02:11:52,960 --> 02:11:55,264
In the past what year was Wesley Snipes lawyer in that tax

2863
02:11:56,032 --> 02:11:57,568
Yeah he's tried to

2864
02:11:57,824 --> 02:12:00,128
Latch onto a lot of these right-wing grifter

2865
02:12:00,896 --> 02:12:02,944
This case

2866
02:12:03,200 --> 02:12:04,224
Along with the Covington

2867
02:12:05,248 --> 02:12:06,528
He's trying to really make an a

2868
02:12:07,296 --> 02:12:08,576
Myself under the auspice

2869
02:12:08,832 --> 02:12:09,600
Pictures of

2870
02:12:09,856 --> 02:12:11,136
The free America lost

2871
02:12:11,648 --> 02:12:12,160
Right

2872
02:12:12,416 --> 02:12:14,208
It's entirely possible that

2873
02:12:14,464 --> 02:12:14,976
It's just

2874
02:12:16,768 --> 02:12:17,280
A scam

2875
02:12:17,536 --> 02:12:19,328
It's entirely possible

2876
02:12:19,584 --> 02:12:20,096
Believes

2877
02:12:20,352 --> 02:12:21,120
With these other

2878
02:12:21,376 --> 02:12:22,912
Conservative libertarian

2879
02:12:23,168 --> 02:12:23,680
Christian

2880
02:12:24,960 --> 02:12:26,240
Public Law offering

2881
02:12:28,032 --> 02:12:28,800
Not catered

2882
02:12:29,056 --> 02:12:30,848
To the specific needs that he has

2883
02:12:31,616 --> 02:12:34,176
Edmonton if he presented his argument as these

2884
02:12:34,432 --> 02:12:36,480
Things do exist but they're not

2885
02:12:36,736 --> 02:12:37,248
You working

2886
02:12:37,504 --> 02:12:39,808
In the direction I want them to

2887
02:12:40,064 --> 02:12:41,088
Create a run

2888
02:12:41,600 --> 02:12:43,648
I would find that argument a little bit more honest

2889
02:12:44,160 --> 02:12:45,440
Since he's not presenting

2890
02:12:45,696 --> 02:12:47,488
Like that in all of this is just

2891
02:12:47,744 --> 02:12:53,888
We don't have anything in the splc NaCl you were running over us his framing of it makes

2892
02:12:54,144 --> 02:12:55,168
It's me really worried

2893
02:12:55,424 --> 02:12:56,192
About what the realtor

2894
02:12:56,704 --> 02:12:57,216
Bizarre

2895
02:12:57,984 --> 02:12:58,496
So

2896
02:12:59,264 --> 02:13:00,544
All I can do

2897
02:13:00,800 --> 02:13:03,360
Is take the pieces of information that are available to

2898
02:13:04,128 --> 02:13:04,640
@ryan makes

2899
02:13:06,176 --> 02:13:06,944
And it's last clip

2900
02:13:07,456 --> 02:13:07,968
Doesn't help

2901
02:13:10,016 --> 02:13:12,320
Great deal.

2902
02:13:16,672 --> 02:13:19,488
To be interviewed by Stefan molyneux

2903
02:13:20,000 --> 02:13:22,816
Someone who is a creep of the highest order

2904
02:13:23,328 --> 02:13:25,120
And a self-described

2905
02:13:25,376 --> 02:13:28,704
Empiricist who supports white nationalism

2906
02:13:29,216 --> 02:13:31,264
So I just don't I don't

2907
02:13:31,520 --> 02:13:33,312
Seaway around looking at this

2908
02:13:33,568 --> 02:13:34,592
In the context

2909
02:13:35,104 --> 02:13:37,152
That Barnes is offering me

2910
02:13:37,664 --> 02:13:38,432
I'm not

2911
02:13:38,688 --> 02:13:39,200
I'm not

2912
02:13:40,992 --> 02:13:41,504
You know

2913
02:13:41,760 --> 02:13:44,832
Anyway I'm looking at his actions

2914
02:13:45,344 --> 02:13:46,112
Compare

2915
02:13:47,136 --> 02:13:51,488
Somebody did very similar things in the past

2916
02:13:53,024 --> 02:13:54,560
You spit to publicize

2917
02:13:55,072 --> 02:13:55,584
His venture

2918
02:13:56,096 --> 02:14:02,240
He's willing to you know he promotes that on Alex's show but will Stefan molyneux and talk about it for

2919
02:14:02,496 --> 02:14:03,008
An hour

2920
02:14:03,264 --> 02:14:04,288
In a way that drift

2921
02:14:05,056 --> 02:14:05,824
Deeply

2922
02:14:06,080 --> 02:14:07,360
Enter Christian identity

2923
02:14:07,616 --> 02:14:09,152
White identity ideas

2924
02:14:10,176 --> 02:14:11,200
That to me is not

2925
02:14:12,224 --> 02:14:12,736
On

2926
02:14:12,992 --> 02:14:13,504
Important

2927
02:14:13,760 --> 02:14:14,272
Nah

2928
02:14:14,784 --> 02:14:15,296
No

2929
02:14:15,808 --> 02:14:17,600
So far every

2930
02:14:17,856 --> 02:14:18,368
Every

2931
02:14:19,136 --> 02:14:20,160
P0land in Iraq

2932
02:14:21,952 --> 02:14:24,000
Every time I've heard anything about it

2933
02:14:24,512 --> 02:14:25,536
Every time I've heard his voice

2934
02:14:26,560 --> 02:14:27,072
Barnes

2935
02:14:27,584 --> 02:14:28,864
Creeps me out

2936
02:14:29,120 --> 02:14:29,888
And he is

2937
02:14:30,656 --> 02:14:33,216
Running something on someone always

2938
02:14:33,472 --> 02:14:36,544
I don't think I've never heard him in any such

2939
02:14:36,800 --> 02:14:38,080
Situation where I feel like he was

2940
02:14:38,848 --> 02:14:41,408
On the up-and-up everything is always been like

2941
02:14:41,664 --> 02:14:43,200
You're running some game on somebody

2942
02:14:43,456 --> 02:14:49,600
Sometime right now like I just don't even know who it is is definitely

2943
02:14:49,856 --> 02:14:51,392
I think a lot of our invitation

2944
02:14:52,672 --> 02:14:54,464
Him trying to take over Infowars

2945
02:14:54,720 --> 02:14:55,488
Goodyear

2946
02:14:55,744 --> 02:14:57,024
Jack actually this

2947
02:14:58,304 --> 02:15:00,096
Easily explained

2948
02:15:00,608 --> 02:15:01,120
By him

2949
02:15:01,376 --> 02:15:02,400
I'm trying to set up this

2950
02:15:02,912 --> 02:15:03,680
Counter to the

2951
02:15:04,448 --> 02:15:06,752
Now that it now that we've heard about that

2952
02:15:08,032 --> 02:15:08,544
I'm trying

2953
02:15:10,080 --> 02:15:12,896
Sure people now who are like

2954
02:15:14,432 --> 02:15:15,456
Tech is starting

2955
02:15:15,712 --> 02:15:16,480
To take some of these

2956
02:15:16,992 --> 02:15:17,504
More seriously

2957
02:15:18,016 --> 02:15:20,064
There are a lot of people who have

2958
02:15:20,576 --> 02:15:21,344
Fascist Outlet

2959
02:15:23,136 --> 02:15:23,648
Francis Outlets

2960
02:15:23,904 --> 02:15:26,208
That are going to be needing a lawyer

2961
02:15:26,464 --> 02:15:27,744
And so creating

2962
02:15:28,512 --> 02:15:30,304
Counter splc that caters

2963
02:15:30,560 --> 02:15:32,864
To people who are of that ilk

2964
02:15:33,120 --> 02:15:33,632
Does

2965
02:15:33,888 --> 02:15:34,656
Seem like it could be a pretty

2966
02:15:34,912 --> 02:15:35,424
Prophet Levin

2967
02:15:35,936 --> 02:15:36,960
So that's why I don't

2968
02:15:37,216 --> 02:15:38,240
Exclude the idea that you just

2969
02:15:39,008 --> 02:15:39,776
But

2970
02:15:40,800 --> 02:15:42,336
It's also even if it is a scam

2971
02:15:43,104 --> 02:15:43,616
Dangerous

2972
02:15:44,128 --> 02:15:44,640
Yeah

2973
02:15:44,896 --> 02:15:47,968
Pat from

2974
