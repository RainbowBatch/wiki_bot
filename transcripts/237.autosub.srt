00:00:13,568 --> 00:00:14,592
Little bit about Alex

00:00:15,104 --> 00:00:19,712
Yes sir

4
00:00:25,088 --> 00:00:25,856
Weird

5
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:27,648
Halloween

6
00:00:27,904 --> 00:00:28,672
Things to sew

Bassett peppermint bark

11
00:00:36,864 --> 00:00:39,168
He's probably out there

12
00:00:39,424 --> 00:00:40,704
Bark

13
00:00:41,216 --> 00:00:41,728
Disgusting

14
00:00:41,984 --> 00:00:44,288
Peppermint bark

15
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:46,336
Yeah but that's

16
00:00:46,592 --> 00:00:50,176
Because

17
00:00:56,832 --> 00:01:00,672
It's a perversion of chocolate

18
00:01:00,928 --> 00:01:01,696
Scrape

Gusset

25
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:24,224
I could be wrong

26
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:26,528
A yearly thing

27
00:01:36,768 --> 00:01:41,888
My grandma was the entire all of the kids in my family

28
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:42,656
These like

29
00:01:43,168 --> 00:01:49,312
Commemorative Lifesavers containers that he ever

30
00:01:58,016 --> 00:02:04,160

Peanut brittle throw you straight out the window

34
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:25,408
I don't know these

35
00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:29,760
I hear holiday candies but I know more about Alex Jones

36
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:31,296
Littleton on about boats

37
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:33,856
I guess

38
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:45,632
Talking about

39
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:51,520
John Birch Society

40
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:53,824
Yep is a Candyman

41
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:57,152
We've it altogether libertarianism

42
00:02:58,176 --> 00:03:00,224
Indeed

43
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:03,296
Back in the past 2000

44
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:05,344

27th

46
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:09,696
Episode

47
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:11,232
The ad the John Birch Society

00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:12,512
President on the show

00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:13,792
Pinterest

50
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:19,936
Anything is Possible

51
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:23,520
Stay so I'd like to take a moment to say thank you

52
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:25,312
Do some of the people who have

53
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:31,968
And are supporting the show House and helping us to keep the lights on

54
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:38,368
You're not allowed to say that

55
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:39,392
You are now policy

56
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:45,280

Thank you all so much

You to someone who is coming in a little bit of a higher level

65
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,559
Appreciate it I'm so very much

66

Isobar

67
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:30,335
Don't get mad and tell your brother someone sodomite sent me a bucket of poop

68
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:36,735

69
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:44,159
Thank you so much

70
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:50,559
Must've been real tough to live through 95 with that name right

71
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:52,863
Right there

72
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:56,447
Well a certain Bob Dole was running for president

73
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:02,335
Confused like maybe you're a relative of Jimmy soul

74
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:05,663
If you want

75
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:18,207
Mistaken for him

76
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:22,559
It's just so prevalent that song dad

77
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:27,167
That song in High School

78
00:05:27,423 --> 00:05:31,519
The only reason I know that song or I can probably take it off the top of my head

79
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:32,543
You yeah it's

80
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:34,335
Weird it's because that was the

81
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:35,359
Friday song

82
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:37,407
That our teacher played

83
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:39,199
Broadcast production class in high school

84
00:05:39,455 --> 00:05:40,479
Always be

85
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:42,015
It's Friday

86
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:46,111
If you want

87
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:52,511
What's your name

88
00:05:54,559 --> 00:06:00,703
In hindsight problematic Choice Realty

89
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:06,591
Anyway

90
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:13,247
A lot of weird stuff

91
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:19,647
Push us into the door jamb on our way out of class everyday

92
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:22,463
F***** up teacher

93
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:25,791
Anyone knew he was doing it

94
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:29,119
Coach Hawkins

95
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:30,399
Good day good day

96
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:32,959
Friends later after I hit

97
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:37,055
Google login

98
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:43,455
Every story you have about your high school really just kind of outlines either some sort of child abuse or

99
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:45,503
Mysterious and dangerous

100
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:49,343
Tough time

101
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:51,391
Yeah I'm sorry

102
00:06:51,647 --> 00:06:54,463
I was my knob

103
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:04,959
We went a little too far

104
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:07,007
2009

105
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:08,543
Bizarre life

106
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:10,591
It's Monday

107
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:14,175
President of the John Birch

108
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:14,943
Society

109
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:18,527
Immediately, into any

110
00:07:18,783 --> 00:07:19,807
That's not really important

111
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:20,575
Necessarily

112
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:23,135
Context

113
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:24,159
An important Frameworks

114
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:25,183
Understand

115
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:27,231
Moving forward in Alex's

116
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:29,279
2009

117
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:35,167
Especially

118
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:36,703
There are

119
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:37,471
Interesting

120
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:39,263
Trends that happened

121
00:07:40,031 --> 00:07:42,079
Website

122
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:46,175
Super abundantly

123
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:47,455
Play clearly the f****** sovereign

124
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:50,527
Definitely

125
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:04,095
It's a few square miles within the city of London itself

126
00:08:06,143 --> 00:08:07,679
Financial

127
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:17,919
I don't really understand fully what Alex is the idea that like this

128
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:19,967
Vatican is private

129
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:20,735
Country with it

130
00:08:20,991 --> 00:08:27,135
Speedy country but not necessarily that the city of Rome is like that

131
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:27,903
But with bangs

132
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:29,951
Because later he says that

133
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:33,791
Is Washington DC the District of Columbia is that but with me

134
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:37,631
Okay

135
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:38,655
We held cities

136
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:40,447
In the world and you have like

137
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:44,031
The

138
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:48,127
The Rome and London to city of London or banking

139
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:48,895
And then watch

140
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:50,175
PCS military

141
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:53,503
Exactly know what all of that amounts to

142
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:54,271
But

143
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:58,879
Look I'm going to look into that more I don't really understand what he's talking about and there are not

144
00:08:59,391 --> 00:09:01,183
Like ready resources on this

145
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:05,023
Lines between the three of them

146
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:05,791
Like a triangle

147
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:07,071
You are

148
00:09:07,327 --> 00:09:08,607
Pictures of

149
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:10,655
Exactly what is the devil sign

150
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:11,679
Triangle

151
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:20,383
System

152
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:31,391
Modern

153
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:35,231
Yes that is what they called

154
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:39,839
For Rome to Greece

155
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:44,191
I digress

156
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:44,959
You do

157
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:49,055
Until proven innocent

158
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:54,175
Blah blah blah blah

159
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:55,455
That's all Sovereign Center

160
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:56,735
It's all

161
00:09:56,991 --> 00:09:57,503
Wacky

162
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:03,903
Distance and how well they know history by just naming

163
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:05,183
6

164
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:08,767
You must know history

165
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:11,839
Yeah Alexandria

166
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:12,863
I'm guessing

167
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:13,887
He just has like

168
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:17,215
I've already forgotten all those cities

169
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:19,775
But it seems like most of them had pork

170
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:32,575
It's really hard to do Orleans

171
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:33,855
Position

172
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:36,159
Sklep Alex

173
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:39,487
Become very

174
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:42,559
Very normal

175
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:43,839
On our show

176
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:45,631
Him giving a prosthetic warnings

177
00:10:45,887 --> 00:10:46,655
That what they are doing

178
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:48,447
People they will soon

179
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:52,031
Be doing to white people

180
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:53,823
Situation you better get ready

181
00:10:54,591 --> 00:11:00,735
Worse and worse and worse I mean we are in 40 trouble because

182
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:11,999
Contract racetrack everywhere k

183
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:16,095
And from here on out it becomes hit larian

184
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:28,383
Start dying here and in Europe soap ready to die

185
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:29,663
Okay

186
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:30,943
Fix that

187
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:38,111
Guess what's behind Diaz at like the globalist are not touch up

188
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:41,695
Until they have full control

189
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:43,487
I guess I guess what's behind that

190
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:48,863
Is that like they know that we're the only ones who are capable of

191
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:52,191
I'm not entirely sure

192
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:53,983
No idea

193
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:55,519
All that stuff is

194
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:56,287
Also just

195
00:11:57,055 --> 00:11:57,823
The little building blocks

196
00:11:59,103 --> 00:12:00,383
Just needs a little dump narratives

197
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:03,455
The globalist they're climbing the mountain

198
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:04,479
A conquest

199
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:06,015
And what's at the top of that mountain

200
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:07,551
About the white cat

201
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:19,327
To start it does

202
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:20,607
Baseline

203
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:21,887
Likewise

204
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:23,423
Let me know

205
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:24,959
Privacy

206
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:25,983
But white

207
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:26,751
Primacy

208
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:29,055
Important

209
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:30,079
They're the best

210
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:33,663
Yeah

211
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:34,687
Whoops

212
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:35,967
Honey whyte's

213
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:37,503
The part of the beginning

214
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:38,783
When I was making

215
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:40,319
Alex

216
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:41,599
Having

217
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:44,927
John Birch Society president on the day before

218
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:46,719
It does show up a little earlier than

219
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:49,535
Because in this next clip

220
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:50,559
Alex Jones

221
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:51,327
Goes

222
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:52,351
Whole Hog

223
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:54,655
He starts attack

224
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:55,423
Taking him

225
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:56,447
Aggressive

226
00:12:58,751 --> 00:12:59,519
The John Birch Society

227
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:25,631
It doesn't matter if I have thousands of government documents Congressional testimony

228
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:32,031
How to terrible with pronoun reference stories about

229
00:13:32,799 --> 00:13:35,359
There is Glenn Beck at someone on

230
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:36,127
Just got the

231
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:37,919
Realities and falsehood

232
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:38,943
Of all the stories

233
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:40,479
The internet about

234
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:45,343
The feud began

235
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:49,183
Whenever Glenn Beck inexplicably chose somebody to

236
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:51,999
Pick through the lies of somebody else who was lying

237
00:13:52,255 --> 00:13:57,631
About stuff that he's also lying about what of this clip

238
00:13:57,887 --> 00:13:58,399
Seem very light

239
00:13:58,911 --> 00:13:59,679
Non suspicious

240
00:13:59,935 --> 00:14:00,447
Just that Alex's

241
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:02,495
Because

242
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:05,055
He has said things like it got to look out with this

243
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:06,079
This guy a little bit early

244
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:08,639
I don't know about him

245
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:09,663
Not that sort

246
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:11,199
Yeah yeah

247
00:14:11,455 --> 00:14:12,223
In line with Alex

248
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:13,247
To a certain extent

249
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:14,527
This goes on

250
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:15,295
You'll start to

251
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:17,087
But

252
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:18,111
Alex's.

253
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:22,719
Chronicles Associated Press

254
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:31,167
You are

255
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:37,823
Halo probably said am I

256
00:14:41,919 --> 00:14:47,551
St.Louis

257
00:14:58,303 --> 00:14:58,815
Not really

258
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:04,191
I'll tell you the truth about them

259
00:15:05,215 --> 00:15:06,751
What are the place to find out if it's true

260
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:09,823
All this stuff

261
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:15,967
News articles

262
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:20,319
You're misrepresenting followers and Ron Paul Allen

263
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:23,135
Chuck Baldwin all those guys got together

264
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:23,903
Big enough

265
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:26,719
Representation of it

266
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:28,255
Got the box

267
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:30,047
Redacted

268
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:33,631
When Paul said that only three people

269
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:37,727
In the middle of the night has misrepresented

270
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:38,495
Impatient

271
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:42,335
Critique

272
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:43,615
Making stuff up

273
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:45,663
Isn't that he's making up

274
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:46,943
Interpretation of it

275
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:48,479
Dishonest way

276
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:51,551
Now the thing that I want to bring sharp Focus

277
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:53,343
Is

278
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:54,111
Alex's

279
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:55,647
Complaint about Glenn Beck

280
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:57,439
Seems to be mostly

281
00:15:57,695 --> 00:15:59,231
He's not extreme enough

282
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:00,255
Or

283
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:01,023
When he's

284
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:01,791
Stream

285
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:02,559
He's lying

286
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:04,351
So there's this

287
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:05,887
There's this

288
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:07,679
He came out and he was talk

289
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:09,215
Talking about the New World Order

290
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:10,495
And how what you need

291
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:13,055
We worry about it we're going to look into it

292
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:15,359
The part where Alex's

293
00:16:15,615 --> 00:16:16,127
Is cool with it

294
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:17,919
But then what

295
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:20,479
Like we looked into it and a lot of this stuff that's going around is

296
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:22,015
True

297
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:22,783
He's

298
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:24,063
Either just talkin about

299
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:24,831
New World Order In

300
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:27,391
Ricky went to believe in him only

301
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:33,791
Do have him say it's not true all right

302
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:34,559
Enough

303
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:35,839
Get it right

304
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:36,607
Either of those the

305
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:37,375
Things are possible

306
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:39,423
But the primary

307
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:40,191
It is

308
00:16:40,703 --> 00:16:41,471
He's not

309
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:42,495
Putting out the rhetoric

310
00:16:43,007 --> 00:16:43,775
I want put out

311
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:45,055
The world

312
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:47,359
Now in this next clip Alex talks about the

313
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:50,175
It might not

314
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:51,199
Surprise you too much

315
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:52,223
Do you hear her make

316
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:52,991
Almost

317
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:53,759
The exact

318
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:54,527
Same criticize

319
00:16:55,039 --> 00:17:01,183
The only thing I hear right now is to Liars getting into about who lies the right way

320
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:03,487
Surface that is kind of

321
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:04,511
But there's more

322
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:05,535
More forces at play here

323
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:06,815
What do you understand that

324
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:07,583
Philosophy

325
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:10,655
It's kind of like the John Birch Society

326
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:33,951
Associated Press article

327
00:17:34,207 --> 00:17:38,815
Where they tried to bribe the police chief another's

328
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:42,911
Antonio Express-News

329
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:44,191
But I am

330
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:03,903
And you know what the public

331
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:09,023
Show

332
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:10,815
McManus

333
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:15,167
In here yesterday the present

334
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:34,879
Knowing about this one.

335
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:37,695
My Dad's friend

336
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:49,471
Bookshelf

337
00:18:55,103 --> 00:18:59,199
Storage things for

338
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:03,551
Ruin my life

339
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:11,999
Does youth service Corps in

340
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:24,543
Well that's in one of the bills to start

341
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:25,823
The New York Times

342
00:19:26,591 --> 00:19:30,175
So you here

343
00:19:30,431 --> 00:19:31,711
Important

344
00:19:32,479 --> 00:19:35,039
If you base elements of that clipart

345
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:35,807
At the beginning

346
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:41,951
He's talking about how the John Birch Society had this guy there who was reporting on stuff that Alex knew wasn't correct

347
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:43,231
So he got in touch with them

348
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:45,535
I meant they corrected their behavior and

349
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:46,559
Very positive

350
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:48,351
Version of this not be

351
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:50,655
Yeah

352
00:19:50,911 --> 00:19:52,959
Accidentally found this book that the course of

353
00:19:53,215 --> 00:19:55,007
His life when he was a child or whatever

354
00:19:55,263 --> 00:19:56,031
And then get you

355
00:19:56,287 --> 00:19:56,799
You talkin to me

356
00:19:57,055 --> 00:19:57,567
McManus

357
00:19:57,823 --> 00:19:58,335
McManus

358
00:19:58,847 --> 00:19:59,615
Degrees on him

359
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:00,895
Extremely

360
00:20:01,151 --> 00:20:01,663
Supposition

361
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:03,199
And Alex

362
00:20:03,455 --> 00:20:03,967
This

363
00:20:04,223 --> 00:20:04,735
Article

364
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:07,551
Do you know is assuming that John

365
00:20:09,855 --> 00:20:11,903
Stream because of the influence

366
00:20:12,927 --> 00:20:15,743
Exerted on him parallel situation okay

367
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:17,023
His feelings about Glenn Beck

368
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:17,791
Feelings about the

369
00:20:18,047 --> 00:20:18,815
John Birch Society

370
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:19,583
Run

371
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:21,375
Almost similar track

372
00:20:22,143 --> 00:20:23,167
Not extreme enough

373
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:25,215
But we can make it better

374
00:20:28,287 --> 00:20:34,431
I was struggling to that story that story was like a game of Chutes and Ladders

375
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:35,711
Spell and we're back in

376
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:37,503
His childhood or whatever it is

377
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:39,807
Is it going on

378
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:46,207
He came for workout

379
00:20:46,463 --> 00:20:46,975
Convoluted

380
00:20:47,487 --> 00:20:49,791
I'm an extemporaneous speaker

381
00:20:50,303 --> 00:20:51,839
You're just a

382
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:53,631
Go to beach

383
00:20:54,911 --> 00:20:56,191
I just I think that's very

384
00:20:57,215 --> 00:20:57,727
No

385
00:20:57,983 --> 00:20:58,495
Sara Lee

386
00:20:59,007 --> 00:20:59,519
Memestube

387
00:21:00,031 --> 00:21:01,055
But it does

388
00:21:01,823 --> 00:21:02,591
Reflect some

389
00:21:05,407 --> 00:21:06,431
So

390
00:21:06,687 --> 00:21:10,527
His view on these guys is that they don't go

391
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:16,928
For the most part where he's coming from now is you guys are in extreme extreme enough in your the New World Order is

392
00:21:17,184 --> 00:21:17,696
Kill Everybody

393
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:19,232
More life

394
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:24,096
Does he other than his apocalyptic they're controlled plague releases

395
00:21:24,608 --> 00:21:25,632
Does he have any like

396
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,192
Opinions that they are

397
00:21:28,448 --> 00:21:34,592
Extreme enough on you know what I'm saying but well I mean he's he's of course saying that the New World Order is

398
00:21:34,848 --> 00:21:35,360
Doing everybody

399
00:21:35,616 --> 00:21:36,640
Yeah

400
00:21:37,408 --> 00:21:38,688
And they're not

401
00:21:39,712 --> 00:21:44,064
But agree or disagree with anything that they are sick

402
00:21:44,576 --> 00:21:46,880
I think your glory that they're over the formerly

403
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:53,280
I think the matter of scale not a matter of

404
00:21:56,352 --> 00:21:56,864
I think that's

405
00:21:57,376 --> 00:21:57,888
Clear

406
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:00,448
Patty and security

407
00:22:00,704 --> 00:22:01,984
I'm not I'm not sure

408
00:22:02,496 --> 00:22:03,008
But

409
00:22:03,776 --> 00:22:05,312
It does lead to Alex talking about Glenn

410
00:22:05,568 --> 00:22:06,080
Quite a bit

411
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:08,384
On the show next clip

412
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:09,664
He complains

413
00:22:10,176 --> 00:22:10,688
About

414
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:12,480
Glenn Beck and John Byrne

415
00:22:12,736 --> 00:22:13,248
Society

416
00:22:13,504 --> 00:22:17,344
And then starts complaining about the very idea that people complain about other people

417
00:22:26,048 --> 00:22:26,816
Christian

418
00:22:27,072 --> 00:22:31,680
Norfolk Christian website

419
00:22:32,192 --> 00:22:35,264
System basically

420
00:22:36,032 --> 00:22:41,152
What are fake Christians

421
00:22:53,952 --> 00:23:00,096
If I speak in Sheraton Hotel in La I don't work for Sheridan AR

422
00:23:00,352 --> 00:23:01,120
Pause for a second

423
00:23:01,376 --> 00:23:02,912
The point out that that's exactly the

424
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:03,936
Inverse of a lodge

425
00:23:04,192 --> 00:23:09,568
Victor uses about Margaret Sanger giving a speech women of the KKK

426
00:23:09,824 --> 00:23:12,128
When you do it you're wrong when I do it I'm right

427
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:41,824
This is crazy

428
00:23:59,232 --> 00:24:00,512
Facebook

429
00:24:01,024 --> 00:24:04,608
Critiquing

430
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:10,752
So he just went from saying that they're not extreme enough

431
00:24:11,008 --> 00:24:13,824
Amen singer Christian website is trying to

432
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,104
Complain about

433
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,408
Yeah this whole thing has been largely

434
00:24:17,664 --> 00:24:19,200
Complaints about people who are

435
00:24:19,456 --> 00:24:23,552
Berkeley on the same side as you have roseola

436
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:28,672
We spent too much time complaining about people not working

437
00:24:30,464 --> 00:24:35,840
Is there complaining about him

438
00:24:36,096 --> 00:24:38,656
And he's complaining that they're complaining

439
00:24:38,912 --> 00:24:40,960
And there's too much complaining going on

440
00:24:41,216 --> 00:24:45,568
And you complaining about that this particular instance

441
00:24:45,824 --> 00:24:48,896
Places email is made up

442
00:24:49,152 --> 00:24:54,784
Forwarded

443
00:24:55,296 --> 00:24:57,088
Nothing

444
00:25:02,464 --> 00:25:03,744
Complaining about about Glenn Beck

445
00:25:04,256 --> 00:25:05,536
Society

446
00:25:05,792 --> 00:25:09,632
Those are complained that they're making Alex complaining about them

447
00:25:10,144 --> 00:25:11,424
In the instance of Glenn Beck

448
00:25:11,936 --> 00:25:12,960
It's not complaining

449
00:25:13,472 --> 00:25:14,496
It's disgusting

450
00:25:14,752 --> 00:25:15,776
Misinformation

451
00:25:16,032 --> 00:25:18,080
The people like Alex are perpetuating

452
00:25:18,592 --> 00:25:20,384
So not to defend going back in anyway

453
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,152
But Vicky

454
00:25:21,408 --> 00:25:22,944
Complained that out says about him is

455
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,736
He's pushing back on my nonsense

456
00:25:25,248 --> 00:25:26,016
Where is

457
00:25:26,272 --> 00:25:26,784
You know his

458
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:27,552
Complained

459
00:25:29,088 --> 00:25:29,600
Is people

460
00:25:29,856 --> 00:25:31,904
People complain I don't know it's it's

461
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:34,208
He's Alex's version has much less tubs

462
00:25:34,464 --> 00:25:34,976
Distance to it

463
00:25:35,232 --> 00:25:36,512
If only because Glenn Beck

464
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:37,280
Just talking about like

465
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:39,328
Oh this is a misrepresentation misreading

466
00:25:39,584 --> 00:25:40,864
This bill or whatever

467
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:48,800
Everyone complains about me we spent too much time complaining and complaining all the

468
00:25:49,568 --> 00:25:52,640
Process

469
00:25:52,896 --> 00:25:53,920
As

470
00:25:54,176 --> 00:25:55,200
Doesn't have one

471
00:25:55,712 --> 00:25:58,784
Like

472
00:25:59,040 --> 00:25:59,808
Here's the thing

473
00:26:01,088 --> 00:26:02,880
I don't like that

474
00:26:03,136 --> 00:26:05,696
And even though it's a thing that I'm doing

475
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:06,720
To do

476
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:08,256
I think it's a bad thing

477
00:26:08,512 --> 00:26:10,304
There's a strong feeling that like

478
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,584
I'm not positive

479
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,888
He knows what he's saying in the middle of us

480
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:15,680
But he said stuff like that

481
00:26:16,192 --> 00:26:18,240
Yeah that's a good boy like I'm not sure he doesn't

482
00:26:18,496 --> 00:26:19,520
Like I'm not sure you understand

483
00:26:20,032 --> 00:26:20,544
But it doesn't

484
00:26:21,824 --> 00:26:23,104
Doesn't have anything

485
00:26:23,616 --> 00:26:24,640
The middle or the last

486
00:26:24,896 --> 00:26:25,408
Since before it

487
00:26:26,944 --> 00:26:28,224
Outright contradict

488
00:26:30,528 --> 00:26:33,344
Score is the convoluted story

489
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:38,464
Patikim over little details

490
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:39,232
Jobs

491
00:26:41,024 --> 00:26:41,792
So far was the

492
00:26:42,304 --> 00:26:43,584
This better business

493
00:26:45,888 --> 00:26:47,424
What I'm saying

494
00:26:48,448 --> 00:26:49,216
I think it's a snake

495
00:26:49,472 --> 00:26:50,496
Text clip really dead

496
00:26:51,264 --> 00:26:53,312
Because what we see is out I think

497
00:26:53,568 --> 00:26:56,128
But he's been a little bit more severe about going back in

498
00:26:56,384 --> 00:26:57,152
In the past that you like

499
00:26:58,176 --> 00:26:58,688
But

500
00:26:58,944 --> 00:27:00,992
Mostly I kind of agree that

501
00:27:01,504 --> 00:27:02,272
Critiques of Glenn Beck

502
00:27:02,528 --> 00:27:03,040
Exacerbated

503
00:27:03,552 --> 00:27:04,064
Not

504
00:27:04,576 --> 00:27:05,088
Attacking him

505
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,112
In the past

506
00:27:06,368 --> 00:27:07,648
Not necessarily attacking

507
00:27:08,416 --> 00:27:09,440
But like staying

508
00:27:09,696 --> 00:27:10,464
You probably

509
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:11,744
Up to something

510
00:27:12,512 --> 00:27:13,792
And it's like not

511
00:27:14,048 --> 00:27:14,816
Treating him like a Target

512
00:27:16,608 --> 00:27:18,400
Yeah yeah I think that's fair

513
00:27:19,424 --> 00:27:20,960
Me and what time

514
00:27:21,472 --> 00:27:26,080
But personal attacks that were so used to seeing from Allison

515
00:27:26,336 --> 00:27:29,152
Look at his dumb hair he's probably a pedophile

516
00:27:29,408 --> 00:27:32,224
Yeah

517
00:27:34,272 --> 00:27:35,296
Things are going to change

518
00:27:35,552 --> 00:27:36,576
And now I'm looking

519
00:27:36,832 --> 00:27:37,856
I'm not as

520
00:27:38,112 --> 00:27:39,136
Some inconsequential

521
00:27:39,648 --> 00:27:40,928
Inconsequential person

522
00:27:41,184 --> 00:27:42,720
That you should be wary of

523
00:27:42,976 --> 00:27:44,000
But now is a targ

524
00:27:46,304 --> 00:27:49,888
Months ago

525
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:57,824
I said the supporters and FEMA camps

526
00:28:12,672 --> 00:28:15,232
With Al-Qaeda and

527
00:28:16,512 --> 00:28:17,792
Psychological manipulation

528
00:28:32,384 --> 00:28:34,176
Popular Mechanics

529
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:46,720
You supply the pictures I'll Supply the war

530
00:28:51,328 --> 00:28:57,472
Barely folks that are always calling for police

531
00:29:01,568 --> 00:29:03,616
More

532
00:29:03,872 --> 00:29:10,016
A guy from Popular Mechanics

533
00:29:10,272 --> 00:29:12,576
Glenn Beck enlisted to

534
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:21,024
Yellow journalism

535
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:22,560
Because he has to attack the store

536
00:29:22,816 --> 00:29:24,096
But if you want to play that game

537
00:29:24,352 --> 00:29:25,120
Then fine Alex

538
00:29:25,376 --> 00:29:26,400
You are a show that

539
00:29:26,656 --> 00:29:27,680
Distributed by Genesis

540
00:29:27,936 --> 00:29:28,448
Communications

541
00:29:28,704 --> 00:29:30,752
That works which is owned by Ted Anderson

542
00:29:31,008 --> 00:29:32,032
Who owns Midas resource

543
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:34,848
Create agenda

544
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,896
Medications net worth

545
00:29:37,152 --> 00:29:39,712
Advertising arm of Midas

546
00:29:41,248 --> 00:29:44,832
You have people on all the time who just try and create Panic food sell gold

547
00:29:45,088 --> 00:29:46,624
So I mean we can play that game

548
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:47,648
You're a thoroughly

549
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:01,216
But it is a f****** South African rapist who believe in Rhodesia

550
00:30:01,472 --> 00:30:04,544
So there you go

551
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,080
I don't know if it is

552
00:30:06,592 --> 00:30:09,920
Nurses office

553
00:30:12,992 --> 00:30:14,272
This knife Cuts both Direct

554
00:30:14,528 --> 00:30:16,832
I think you should probably

555
00:30:17,088 --> 00:30:20,672
Give a pass for first publishing owning Popular Mechanics

556
00:30:20,928 --> 00:30:21,952
Unless you have specific

557
00:30:22,208 --> 00:30:23,488
Complain about

558
00:30:25,024 --> 00:30:25,536
Person

559
00:30:25,792 --> 00:30:26,304
Or any

560
00:30:35,264 --> 00:30:41,408
They are now going to court.

561
00:30:41,664 --> 00:30:44,736
Very underwhelming

562
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:49,856
The research

563
00:31:14,176 --> 00:31:15,968
I want you to make

564
00:31:21,344 --> 00:31:24,928
Jamaica Coronavirus

565
00:31:25,184 --> 00:31:26,976
And I can piggyback Glenn Beck success

566
00:31:28,512 --> 00:31:30,560
The dependent brings up there as his

567
00:31:31,072 --> 00:31:31,584
Example of

568
00:31:34,912 --> 00:31:35,424
Can't prog

569
00:31:36,192 --> 00:31:37,984
It really is just about

570
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:38,752
Creating

571
00:31:39,008 --> 00:31:39,776
The private prison

572
00:31:41,312 --> 00:31:42,592
The idea that you can make

573
00:31:42,848 --> 00:31:43,616
Inmates work

574
00:31:43,872 --> 00:31:45,408
Yeah I know that's flavor is labor

575
00:31:46,432 --> 00:31:48,224
If you want to talk about that in the realistic

576
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,760
Segway I would really appreciate

577
00:31:50,016 --> 00:31:52,576
But if he wants to fold it into this FEMA camp nonsense

578
00:31:52,832 --> 00:31:54,880
Then it what it does is diminish

579
00:31:55,392 --> 00:31:58,208
The ability to work against the actual evil that he

580
00:31:58,720 --> 00:31:59,232
Pretends to be

581
00:31:59,488 --> 00:32:00,000
We complaining about

582
00:32:00,512 --> 00:32:01,024
So

583
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,304
That to me is a problem

584
00:32:03,584 --> 00:32:05,120
The other problem here

585
00:32:05,376 --> 00:32:06,912
Think what I think is going on

586
00:32:07,424 --> 00:32:08,192
That's just my theory

587
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:09,472
And it

588
00:32:09,984 --> 00:32:14,592
I didn't know about this episode when we recorded the episode about him interviewing the John Birch

589
00:32:15,872 --> 00:32:16,640
And we talked about

590
00:32:16,896 --> 00:32:17,408
The connections with

591
00:32:17,664 --> 00:32:18,688
Koch brothers

592
00:32:18,944 --> 00:32:19,456
Freedomworks

593
00:32:19,712 --> 00:32:20,224
Citizens

594
00:32:21,248 --> 00:32:24,576
54 Prosperity Americans for Prosperity

595
00:32:24,832 --> 00:32:25,856
A sound economy

596
00:32:26,112 --> 00:32:26,880
Like all of these

597
00:32:27,136 --> 00:32:28,160
I didn't know that

598
00:32:28,416 --> 00:32:29,184
The next day Alex

599
00:32:29,696 --> 00:32:30,720
Hard on Glenn Beck

600
00:32:31,232 --> 00:32:31,744
When I

601
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,280
Brought up those connections

602
00:32:33,536 --> 00:32:36,352
You know that I'm not reading this

603
00:32:36,864 --> 00:32:38,656
I'm saying like

604
00:32:39,168 --> 00:32:40,704
He's mad at Glenn Beck probably

605
00:32:41,984 --> 00:32:43,264
He's now creating the

606
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:44,032
Sing

607
00:32:44,544 --> 00:32:45,312
Here here

608
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:46,848
This is tough to put into work

609
00:32:49,152 --> 00:32:49,920
Is it Alex

610
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:50,688
Creating

611
00:32:50,944 --> 00:32:52,736
The appearance

612
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:54,272
Because

613
00:32:54,528 --> 00:32:55,040
It is

614
00:32:55,552 --> 00:32:56,832
This is where it's at

615
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,416
Conspiratorial

616
00:33:03,744 --> 00:33:09,888
I think it might be in the same way Meek Mill versus Drake when they both have an album coming out and it boosted

617
00:33:12,192 --> 00:33:14,240
Glenn Beck is even necessarily

618
00:33:14,496 --> 00:33:17,056
Lord knows what's going on right

619
00:33:17,312 --> 00:33:17,824
But I

620
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:20,384
Strategy where

621
00:33:22,176 --> 00:33:23,456
Ostensibly

622
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:25,760
You have that

623
00:33:26,272 --> 00:33:27,296
Have a petty argument

624
00:33:27,552 --> 00:33:28,064
Of some sort

625
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,088
And what you do is you

626
00:33:29,344 --> 00:33:30,112
To create a rattle

627
00:33:30,368 --> 00:33:31,136
Radicalization

628
00:33:32,416 --> 00:33:32,928
You know like

629
00:33:34,464 --> 00:33:35,488
It's it's a perfect

630
00:33:35,744 --> 00:33:36,768
Chamber wherein

631
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:40,096
Because it's easy

632
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:41,888
If you're like a Fox News watcher

633
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,680
Or you're somebody who

634
00:33:43,936 --> 00:33:44,704
Has inclination

635
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:47,264
Towards the right it's really easy to fall into

636
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:48,032
Glenn Beck

637
00:33:48,544 --> 00:33:50,336
It's more difficult to fall into Alex Jones

638
00:33:51,104 --> 00:33:52,384
He is much more extreme

639
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,176
Yells about s*** all the time

640
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:58,016
He references documents that he wants you to read that you'll never be able to find

641
00:33:58,272 --> 00:34:00,064
All this stuff is very confusing

642
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:01,600
To the the immediate

643
00:34:01,856 --> 00:34:02,880
Glenn Beck

644
00:34:03,136 --> 00:34:03,648
Is very easy

645
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:04,672
So

646
00:34:05,696 --> 00:34:06,464
Baby step

647
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:09,280
From sort of normal well-meaning conservit

648
00:34:09,536 --> 00:34:11,072
Motive can be to go to Glenn Beck

649
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,888
Right right, Glenn Beck's van

650
00:34:14,656 --> 00:34:15,168
You get

651
00:34:15,424 --> 00:34:17,472
Sort of used to that temperature of water

652
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:22,080
Then there's someone who is out there who's yelling The Glenn Beck is a fraud

653
00:34:22,336 --> 00:34:23,616
And the two of them have it

654
00:34:23,872 --> 00:34:24,384
A beef

655
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:26,176
It may or may not be one-sided

656
00:34:27,712 --> 00:34:28,736
And what does

657
00:34:28,992 --> 00:34:30,016
Create the opportunity

658
00:34:30,272 --> 00:34:31,040
Need to jump from the

659
00:34:31,808 --> 00:34:33,856
Sort of warm water of going back into

660
00:34:34,112 --> 00:34:36,928
To be scalding hot water of Alex Jones without

661
00:34:37,184 --> 00:34:38,976
Like noticing it's so hot and burning

662
00:34:42,816 --> 00:34:43,328
Hey

663
00:34:45,632 --> 00:34:46,144
Is it from that

664
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:46,912
Light on

665
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:48,704
Is people who want to push the

666
00:34:49,472 --> 00:34:50,240
Further to the right

667
00:34:50,496 --> 00:34:51,008
Yeah

668
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:57,664
People are leaving from Glenn Beck to go to Alex Jones

669
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,968
Incredibly hot water

670
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:05,344
That is going to heat up his own water in order to get those people

671
00:35:12,256 --> 00:35:13,792
Because if he gets too hot

672
00:35:16,096 --> 00:35:17,376
Which may actually accidentally

673
00:35:17,888 --> 00:35:18,656
Then what happened

674
00:35:20,704 --> 00:35:21,216
I don't know

675
00:35:21,472 --> 00:35:23,520
I don't think that this is necessarily what happen

676
00:35:23,776 --> 00:35:24,288
But I would not be

677
00:35:24,544 --> 00:35:25,312
Be surprised at all

678
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:27,872
Glenn Beck

679
00:35:28,128 --> 00:35:29,408
Thought in his rise to promise

680
00:35:29,664 --> 00:35:30,432
Also

681
00:35:30,688 --> 00:35:31,712
Eventually paying out

682
00:35:31,968 --> 00:35:32,480
Alex Jones

683
00:35:32,736 --> 00:35:33,504
To serve as

684
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:34,784
The more extreme version

685
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:37,600
I think that's a result of their purpose

686
00:35:38,624 --> 00:35:39,136
Credibly well

687
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:43,744
I fall short of saying that I think that that's

688
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:44,512
McKay's

689
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:46,048
Is because it is

690
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:47,840
Crazy things

691
00:35:48,608 --> 00:35:53,984
What's the business verticals vertical integration

692
00:35:54,496 --> 00:35:59,872
It's controlling the entire eat you control the entire method production

693
00:36:00,128 --> 00:36:01,152
I feel

694
00:36:01,408 --> 00:36:02,176
About

695
00:36:03,968 --> 00:36:04,992
Nature

696
00:36:05,248 --> 00:36:08,576
I find it very difficult

697
00:36:08,832 --> 00:36:09,600
Circle 2

698
00:36:09,856 --> 00:36:11,136
Look at the picture that we have in

699
00:36:11,392 --> 00:36:13,184
In front of us knowing what I know

700
00:36:13,696 --> 00:36:14,976
Like for example

701
00:36:15,488 --> 00:36:16,256
I know

702
00:36:16,512 --> 00:36:18,560
Did Alex Jones is deadlocked

703
00:36:19,072 --> 00:36:20,352
Calling avoyelles Revenue

704
00:36:20,608 --> 00:36:21,888
From the lands that he owned

705
00:36:22,144 --> 00:36:22,656
In Texas

706
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:26,240
Pretty recently before this

707
00:36:27,008 --> 00:36:30,592
I know that Alex Jones moved into a new studio where the rent was higher

708
00:36:30,848 --> 00:36:31,872
Around this time

709
00:36:32,384 --> 00:36:35,712
I know that he just had the John Birch Society president on

710
00:36:35,968 --> 00:36:37,760
And change the number of his position

711
00:36:38,272 --> 00:36:39,040
Mid interview

712
00:36:39,296 --> 00:36:39,808
With him

713
00:36:40,064 --> 00:36:42,624
I know that freedomworks in Americans

714
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:43,648
For prosperity

715
00:36:43,904 --> 00:36:44,672
Funnel tons

716
00:36:44,928 --> 00:36:46,208
Money and they are run by the

717
00:36:46,464 --> 00:36:47,488
The children of

718
00:36:47,744 --> 00:36:49,024
One of the founding members

719
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,560
Society

720
00:36:51,072 --> 00:36:52,352
I know that a couple months

721
00:36:52,864 --> 00:36:55,424
After this episode

722
00:36:56,192 --> 00:36:57,216
So I know what number is

723
00:36:57,472 --> 00:36:58,240
Things that make it look

724
00:36:58,496 --> 00:36:59,264
Really difficult for

725
00:37:00,288 --> 00:37:01,056
To not think

726
00:37:01,568 --> 00:37:02,592
There's something up here

727
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:06,688
And the fact that the day after the John Birch Society president

728
00:37:06,944 --> 00:37:07,712
Was on the show

729
00:37:07,968 --> 00:37:08,480
Alex

730
00:37:08,736 --> 00:37:09,248
Pivot

731
00:37:09,504 --> 00:37:11,296
His position on Glenn Beck

732
00:37:12,064 --> 00:37:13,600
From being someone who

733
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:14,880
He's like an annoying

734
00:37:15,136 --> 00:37:17,952
GameFly your shoe in the way

735
00:37:18,208 --> 00:37:23,584
The probably not great news I don't want to hang out with them but I'm not going to I'm not going to get into a fight with them

736
00:37:24,096 --> 00:37:25,888
Now being like he's a danger

737
00:37:26,656 --> 00:37:29,216
Yeah I don't know how else to look at that

738
00:37:29,728 --> 00:37:30,752
Other than through like

739
00:37:33,056 --> 00:37:33,824
It's f****** weird

740
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:36,640
Right

741
00:37:37,152 --> 00:37:37,664
Yeah

742
00:37:38,176 --> 00:37:38,688
I could just

743
00:37:38,944 --> 00:37:39,456
Feels like

744
00:37:39,712 --> 00:37:40,736
The easiest way I can

745
00:37:40,992 --> 00:37:42,016
Can explain that is

746
00:37:42,528 --> 00:37:43,552
Alex needs bunny

747
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,600
You know someone who's got money

748
00:37:46,112 --> 00:37:47,136
Serves the purpose

749
00:37:47,392 --> 00:37:49,184
Yeah

750
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:51,744
Werther's where there's smoke

751
00:37:52,256 --> 00:37:55,584
There is probably Nazis burning books in a fire

752
00:37:56,096 --> 00:37:57,120
This could be nothing

753
00:37:57,632 --> 00:38:00,448
It could be nothing I could be making a mountain out of a molehill

754
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:01,472
I don't know

755
00:38:01,984 --> 00:38:04,032
But the facts on the ground lead me to

756
00:38:04,288 --> 00:38:05,824
You think this is something I got it

757
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:07,104
I got to keep my eye on

758
00:38:07,616 --> 00:38:08,640
And look into a little bit more

759
00:38:09,152 --> 00:38:09,664
So we'll see

760
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:10,688
As time goes on

761
00:38:10,944 --> 00:38:11,456
But

762
00:38:11,712 --> 00:38:12,224
But you

763
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:14,016
Straight up just doing

764
00:38:14,272 --> 00:38:15,296
You just ends up

765
00:38:15,808 --> 00:38:17,088
Keeps on dunking on Glenn Beck

766
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:20,672
Here at this point he invites Jason bermas onto the show

767
00:38:22,464 --> 00:38:25,024
Have a little bit of a s*** on Glenn Beck special

768
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:31,680
The best thing about this Alex aguiar

769
00:38:31,936 --> 00:38:36,800
Pressure OverWatch

770
00:38:37,056 --> 00:38:43,200
He's telling us the truth about the financial

771
00:39:02,656 --> 00:39:05,216
He's very proud that over a quarter-million people have joined

772
00:39:05,472 --> 00:39:11,616
Really turns in my stomach I mean this guy is fine

773
00:39:19,552 --> 00:39:22,880
11 hour call to service day and

774
00:39:23,392 --> 00:39:29,536
Are you guys f****** talking about

775
00:39:29,792 --> 00:39:30,816
Malicious

776
00:39:36,192 --> 00:39:37,728
There is something up

777
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:44,128
Barrage

778
00:39:44,384 --> 00:39:47,200
Lies that they're telling it's almost past each other

779
00:39:47,456 --> 00:39:49,504
They like I don't even know if they're talking about the same

780
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:50,272
Instinct

781
00:39:50,528 --> 00:39:52,064
Back is following the Maya

782
00:39:52,832 --> 00:39:53,600
He's following you

783
00:39:53,856 --> 00:39:54,368
I don't know

784
00:39:55,136 --> 00:39:56,160
I don't know how you would fall

785
00:39:56,416 --> 00:40:02,560
The descriptive report they put a little piece of wood and they have the

786
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:06,400
Fruitless

787
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:11,520
This is something that is very interesting to me

788
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:14,592
We'll have to see how it plays out and I was really hoping

789
00:40:14,848 --> 00:40:15,616
Visit Friday

790
00:40:15,872 --> 00:40:18,176
Until like I was really hoping this Sunday's episode

791
00:40:18,432 --> 00:40:20,224
Would give me more insight into this

792
00:40:21,248 --> 00:40:25,344
The whole thing is just an interview with Webster.

793
00:40:25,856 --> 00:40:27,392
I don't want to talk about

794
00:40:27,648 --> 00:40:28,160
Guitar play

795
00:40:28,416 --> 00:40:31,232
Why we will later but

796
00:40:31,488 --> 00:40:32,512
Because Alex is trying

797
00:40:36,608 --> 00:40:38,656
So I think he's going to be

798
00:40:38,912 --> 00:40:45,056
He's going to take a

799
00:40:45,824 --> 00:40:46,336
Like sort of

800
00:40:46,592 --> 00:40:47,360
Tough situation

801
00:40:47,616 --> 00:40:48,128
Is it like his

802
00:40:48,384 --> 00:40:49,920
Tire show on

803
00:40:50,944 --> 00:40:52,992
This is all just an interview

804
00:40:56,832 --> 00:40:57,600
That's because

805
00:41:00,672 --> 00:41:01,952
So he's using that as

806
00:41:02,208 --> 00:41:04,000
Platform okay

807
00:41:04,256 --> 00:41:04,768
The

808
00:41:06,048 --> 00:41:06,560
Reflux beef

809
00:41:06,816 --> 00:41:10,912
Hibbett in the change that happens over time we're now Sunday shows are kind of like

810
00:41:12,192 --> 00:41:13,728
Whereas before they were where

811
00:41:13,984 --> 00:41:15,264
You could actually get much more Market

812
00:41:17,568 --> 00:41:18,080
It's interesting

813
00:41:19,872 --> 00:41:20,640
I don't know how to say

814
00:41:20,896 --> 00:41:21,408
Synthesizer

815
00:41:21,664 --> 00:41:22,944
But there is a clue somewhere

816
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:23,712
Going to make it all makes

817
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:24,992
Probably

818
00:41:26,272 --> 00:41:26,784
For now

819
00:41:27,296 --> 00:41:29,600
Much like Alex Jones in the past about Glenn Beck

820
00:41:30,112 --> 00:41:30,624
I'm weary

821
00:41:31,648 --> 00:41:34,208
Call boy I got my eyes open but I will see

822
00:41:34,464 --> 00:41:37,280
We are you are looking for

823
00:41:37,792 --> 00:41:41,120
Where in the world is Blair in the world

824
00:41:42,656 --> 00:41:44,704
We see another thing that's a little bit in

825
00:41:45,472 --> 00:41:45,984
And that is

826
00:41:51,616 --> 00:41:52,128
Hellboy

827
00:41:52,384 --> 00:41:54,943
Until this point Alex Jones did not know about

828
00:41:55,199 --> 00:41:55,711
Garage

829
00:41:55,967 --> 00:42:01,343
You still going by Stephen yaxley-lennon

830
00:42:01,855 --> 00:42:04,671
I think he's actually in 2009 I think he was in

831
00:42:04,927 --> 00:42:05,951
Straight up Nazis

832
00:42:06,463 --> 00:42:09,791
I'm pretty sure if I recall his timeline correctly

833
00:42:10,047 --> 00:42:13,887
He was like operating anonymously as the leader of the you like European

834
00:42:14,143 --> 00:42:17,215
In front European Defense

835
00:42:17,983 --> 00:42:18,751
Oh that's not good

836
00:42:19,007 --> 00:42:19,519
Goodnotes

837
00:42:19,775 --> 00:42:22,335
The ebl

838
00:42:23,359 --> 00:42:29,503
Bring bring

839
00:42:29,759 --> 00:42:30,783
It kind of old

840
00:42:31,039 --> 00:42:33,087
Reinforces your Theory on

841
00:42:34,367 --> 00:42:36,415
Alex Jones

842
00:42:36,671 --> 00:42:37,439
So much money

843
00:42:37,695 --> 00:42:39,999
Why would they

844
00:42:40,255 --> 00:42:42,303
That we're so used to seeing fund all these

845
00:42:42,559 --> 00:42:44,095
Right-wing lunatics

846
00:42:44,351 --> 00:42:47,423
Also fund

847
00:42:47,935 --> 00:42:51,775
If they weren't also funding all kinds of out now.

848
00:42:52,031 --> 00:42:52,799
And further to the

849
00:42:53,055 --> 00:42:54,591
The point why would you not find out

850
00:42:54,847 --> 00:42:55,359
Exactly

851
00:42:55,615 --> 00:42:57,663
That's the other thing that's kind of has like a tough

852
00:42:58,175 --> 00:42:58,943
Head scratcher

853
00:42:59,455 --> 00:42:59,967
With

854
00:43:00,223 --> 00:43:00,991
With this

855
00:43:01,503 --> 00:43:03,295
I don't I don't know

856
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:05,855
Are you like

857
00:43:06,111 --> 00:43:06,623
Clear that

858
00:43:06,879 --> 00:43:07,391
Someone's

859
00:43:09,695 --> 00:43:11,743
You kept any plays along compilation

860
00:43:12,511 --> 00:43:13,791
I've just completely out contacts

861
00:43:14,047 --> 00:43:14,559
Text clips

862
00:43:14,815 --> 00:43:17,375
I'd like Nigel farage yelling at Gordon Brown

863
00:43:18,143 --> 00:43:19,167
On the floor

864
00:43:21,471 --> 00:43:23,007
He does know

865
00:43:23,519 --> 00:43:24,031
Lord Vox

866
00:43:24,543 --> 00:43:26,335
At this point

867
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:31,455
So he's aware of Lord monckton as someone who's like climate changes

868
00:43:32,991 --> 00:43:37,343
He doesn't know Nigel farage garage doesn't show up on his show until a couple months down the line

869
00:43:38,623 --> 00:43:41,439
He doesn't really know about the UK independence party

870
00:43:41,951 --> 00:43:45,279
He's not particularly interested in it except for like

871
00:43:46,047 --> 00:43:47,071
Broader speaking

872
00:43:47,327 --> 00:43:48,095
Trends

873
00:43:48,351 --> 00:43:49,887
But he has about like

874
00:43:50,399 --> 00:43:50,911
Getting rid of it

875
00:43:51,423 --> 00:43:52,191
Stuff like that

876
00:43:54,495 --> 00:43:55,263
It's interesting cuz

877
00:43:55,519 --> 00:43:56,543
Who plays this long

878
00:43:56,799 --> 00:43:57,567
Long compilation

879
00:43:57,823 --> 00:43:59,103
Mirage yelling on the

880
00:43:59,359 --> 00:43:59,871
Lafleur

881
00:44:00,127 --> 00:44:00,639
And then

882
00:44:01,151 --> 00:44:01,663
You come back

883
00:44:01,919 --> 00:44:02,431
Spring break with

884
00:44:37,759 --> 00:44:43,903
Republic

885
00:44:45,183 --> 00:44:45,695
Oh boy

886
00:44:45,951 --> 00:44:47,487
It's interesting

887
00:44:47,743 --> 00:44:48,511
It's really interesting

888
00:44:48,767 --> 00:44:49,279
2 mi to feet

889
00:44:50,303 --> 00:44:50,815
Now being

890
00:44:51,071 --> 00:44:51,839
Folded into

891
00:44:52,095 --> 00:44:56,959
Do Alex's World immediately after the interview with a John Birch Society

892
00:44:57,215 --> 00:44:58,239
We see the introduction of the

893
00:44:58,495 --> 00:44:59,007
Presents

894
00:44:59,519 --> 00:45:01,567
Of the UK independence party and Nigel

895
00:45:01,823 --> 00:45:02,335
Mirage

896
00:45:02,591 --> 00:45:03,615
Being someone that Alex

897
00:45:04,127 --> 00:45:06,175
Not by name cuz I don't think he knows his

898
00:45:06,943 --> 00:45:07,711
At this point even

899
00:45:07,967 --> 00:45:14,111
You never say never

900
00:45:15,391 --> 00:45:19,999
Yes he does like these guys are really giving it to the idea of Greater Britain

901
00:45:20,511 --> 00:45:22,047
Being in the world

902
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:23,583
You should know

903
00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:26,655
You should be able to talk about this more if you're as much of an expert

904
00:45:27,423 --> 00:45:28,191
But it's here

905
00:45:28,447 --> 00:45:31,007
And it's a huge part of his stuff moving forward

906
00:45:31,263 --> 00:45:33,311
Resistance to globalism

907
00:45:34,335 --> 00:45:37,663
EU is Nigel farage in UK

908
00:45:38,175 --> 00:45:39,455
So this is the beginning of that

909
00:45:39,711 --> 00:45:42,527
So this is the beginning of our International nationalist Alliance

910
00:45:49,439 --> 00:45:50,719
In 2009

911
00:45:50,975 --> 00:45:52,255
Astroneer

912
00:45:53,023 --> 00:45:54,559
Use the Russian angle on the

913
00:45:55,071 --> 00:45:59,167
Ukrainian gas prices

914
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:00,191
Russian side like

915
00:46:01,471 --> 00:46:06,079
And so this is true of so much of Nigel farage and you kept it all that s***

916
00:46:06,335 --> 00:46:09,919
They too are funded by right-wing billionaires in the United

917
00:46:10,431 --> 00:46:13,759
So that we start to see this coming at this time

918
00:46:14,015 --> 00:46:19,647
That's right while all of these guys are together and this is the first time that Alex starts bringing up

919
00:46:19,903 --> 00:46:21,951
UK lunatics

920
00:46:22,463 --> 00:46:23,743
Alongside him

921
00:46:23,999 --> 00:46:25,023
The John Birch Society

922
00:46:25,535 --> 00:46:27,071
Or having him on the Shelf

923
00:46:27,327 --> 00:46:29,631
Not meeting for the first date they talked before

924
00:46:30,399 --> 00:46:32,191
But there does seem to be a

925
00:46:39,103 --> 00:46:41,151
It's just it's a lot

926
00:46:41,407 --> 00:46:43,455
It's a lot and I don't really like I don't

927
00:46:43,711 --> 00:46:46,015
It's tough for me to do this as a show

928
00:46:46,527 --> 00:46:48,319
Because I don't want to put out into the

929
00:46:48,575 --> 00:46:50,623
The world's would lead one of our listeners.

930
00:46:52,671 --> 00:46:55,999
This is now a Broad City of all these things

931
00:46:58,303 --> 00:46:59,071
We need to find

932
00:46:59,327 --> 00:47:00,351
Whatever indications

933
00:47:00,863 --> 00:47:01,375
We can find

934
00:47:01,887 --> 00:47:03,935
And as we look into it if we find things

935
00:47:04,703 --> 00:47:05,215
Prove

936
00:47:05,471 --> 00:47:06,751
Whatever we're suspecting

937
00:47:07,263 --> 00:47:13,407
I'm fine with that runs down the line and it gets like

938
00:47:13,663 --> 00:47:14,687
Doesn't work

939
00:47:14,943 --> 00:47:15,455
Alex

940
00:47:16,735 --> 00:47:18,015
Getting money that week

941
00:47:18,271 --> 00:47:22,623
Thank you. We had during our 2015 investigation

942
00:47:23,135 --> 00:47:29,279
Like we're speculating

943
00:47:29,535 --> 00:47:35,679
And then two days later

944
00:47:35,935 --> 00:47:37,727
Understand

945
00:47:38,239 --> 00:47:38,751
We're coming from

946
00:47:39,007 --> 00:47:41,055
Not a position of Authority or

947
00:47:41,311 --> 00:47:41,823
Knowing

948
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:43,871
Where to position

949
00:47:44,127 --> 00:47:44,639
Pieces

950
00:47:45,151 --> 00:47:46,687
That look weird

951
00:47:46,943 --> 00:47:48,479
And we'll see if it

952
00:47:48,735 --> 00:47:50,783
Is puzzle piece

953
00:47:51,551 --> 00:47:52,063
Together

954
00:47:52,575 --> 00:47:55,647
Picture that we think it will be wrong

955
00:47:56,159 --> 00:47:57,439
The other thing too is that like

956
00:47:57,951 --> 00:47:58,719
I would understand

957
00:47:59,231 --> 00:48:01,279
A criticism of the speculation that

958
00:48:02,047 --> 00:48:03,327
If there's only one or two

959
00:48:07,167 --> 00:48:13,311
If you will achieve just the president of the John Birch Society was on his show and then the next day he insulted

960
00:48:14,335 --> 00:48:14,847
I wouldn't think that

961
00:48:15,615 --> 00:48:17,407
The world

962
00:48:17,663 --> 00:48:18,175
That would be the bigger

963
00:48:19,199 --> 00:48:20,223
Bedroom

964
00:48:25,087 --> 00:48:25,855
Alex does

965
00:48:27,647 --> 00:48:30,719
Say that he's wrong

966
00:48:30,975 --> 00:48:31,999
Right

967
00:48:32,255 --> 00:48:33,535
Yeah that makes sense with that

968
00:48:34,815 --> 00:48:36,095
Little pieces around it

969
00:48:37,631 --> 00:48:38,399
It just smells bad

970
00:48:38,911 --> 00:48:40,959
It does I don't know

971
00:48:41,215 --> 00:48:41,983
So anyway

972
00:48:42,239 --> 00:48:44,287
We are also starting

973
00:48:45,055 --> 00:48:45,567
9:30

974
00:48:46,591 --> 00:48:47,103
Which

975
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:48,383
Encourages everybody

976
00:48:48,639 --> 00:48:49,151
Kickback

977
00:48:49,407 --> 00:48:49,919
2

978
00:48:50,175 --> 00:48:51,967
9:13 the day after

979
00:48:52,991 --> 00:48:55,039
Glenn Beck started his 912 movement

980
00:48:55,295 --> 00:48:55,807
And how it made you

981
00:48:56,063 --> 00:48:56,575
You feel

982
00:48:57,087 --> 00:48:58,623
And that is that Glenn Beck is a huge ship

983
00:48:59,135 --> 00:49:00,415
There's also

984
00:49:01,183 --> 00:49:01,951
Yeah

985
00:49:02,207 --> 00:49:03,231
How did the

986
00:49:07,583 --> 00:49:09,631
Yeah I don't have

987
00:49:09,887 --> 00:49:10,399
A handle on it

988
00:49:11,167 --> 00:49:17,311
Nebulous in stupid concept that it was hard.

989
00:49:20,383 --> 00:49:21,919
I think it was I think it was pretty specific

990
00:49:22,175 --> 00:49:24,735
It was trying to recapture that feeling you had all night

991
00:49:24,991 --> 00:49:26,015
12

992
00:49:26,527 --> 00:49:30,879
9 principles and 12 guidelines or whatever

993
00:49:32,415 --> 00:49:34,719
If there's a lot of ways to criticise him I don't think that's why

994
00:49:35,487 --> 00:49:36,767
Lookbook

995
00:49:37,279 --> 00:49:38,047
Who gives a

996
00:49:38,815 --> 00:49:39,839
All they know is a baby

997
00:49:40,095 --> 00:49:40,863
Need to start attacking Guam

998
00:49:43,167 --> 00:49:43,935
Now at this point

999
00:49:46,239 --> 00:49:48,543
Oh I should also say coincidentally

1000
00:49:48,799 --> 00:49:51,359
Another piece of my constellation is

1001
00:49:51,871 --> 00:49:52,895
Bob Chapman's on this app

1002
00:49:55,455 --> 00:49:55,967
Sell gold

1003
00:49:56,223 --> 00:49:57,759
They don't talk about it at all cuz Alex

1004
00:49:58,015 --> 00:49:59,807
Too busy tried to complain about Glenn Beck

1005
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:00,831
So

1006
00:50:01,343 --> 00:50:01,855
There is a

1007
00:50:02,111 --> 00:50:06,463
Replacement of normal roll on the Shelf

1008
00:50:06,719 --> 00:50:07,743
Episode in months

1009
00:50:08,255 --> 00:50:09,535
Did Bob Chapman didn't exist

1010
00:50:09,791 --> 00:50:10,559
Specifically

1011
00:50:10,815 --> 00:50:16,959
To set up Alex on the volleyball court to spike a gold

1012
00:50:17,215 --> 00:50:18,239
Chapman's on here at all

1013
00:50:18,751 --> 00:50:21,567
Is just on as a like soda guy to agree with Alex

1014
00:50:21,823 --> 00:50:23,359
Wow you complaining about Glenn Beck

1015
00:50:23,871 --> 00:50:24,383
And all of these

1016
00:50:25,407 --> 00:50:27,455
Which vacuum you just be like well

1017
00:50:27,967 --> 00:50:28,735
Alex's

1018
00:50:29,503 --> 00:50:32,831
Bitching and so when the spirit gets good to him

1019
00:50:38,975 --> 00:50:41,279
Amidst all of the other data points

1020
00:50:44,863 --> 00:50:45,375
Complete honesty

1021
00:50:45,631 --> 00:50:46,655
See I have heard episodes

1022
00:50:46,911 --> 00:50:47,679
Where Bob Chapman's Auto

1023
00:50:47,935 --> 00:50:48,447
They don't sell gold

1024
00:50:48,959 --> 00:50:49,471
But they are

1025
00:50:50,495 --> 00:50:51,007
Rare

1026
00:50:51,263 --> 00:50:52,031
They are all

1027
00:50:52,287 --> 00:50:53,567
Probably heard

1028
00:50:54,847 --> 00:50:57,407
Yeah it's not like it never happened

1029
00:50:58,175 --> 00:50:59,967
So it's within the realm of like

1030
00:51:00,223 --> 00:51:01,759
It could be a real crazy

1031
00:51:02,015 --> 00:51:02,783
Coincidence

1032
00:51:04,575 --> 00:51:07,135
Anyway what are those three times

1033
00:51:07,647 --> 00:51:09,951
I assume where they held a surprise party on

1034
00:51:10,207 --> 00:51:14,303
Anniversary of Rhodesia

1035
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:20,703
Virginity right that was the other one they just said such Brody for a while

1036
00:51:24,287 --> 00:51:26,079
Appearance but we are going

1037
00:51:27,615 --> 00:51:28,127
With another guy

1038
00:51:29,151 --> 00:51:29,663
Alex

1039
00:51:30,175 --> 00:51:30,687
Has a guy on

1040
00:51:31,199 --> 00:51:31,711
For good

1041
00:51:32,223 --> 00:51:32,991
Or so

1042
00:51:33,759 --> 00:51:34,271
This guy

1043
00:52:00,895 --> 00:52:07,039
Certification for naturopathic doctors

1044
00:52:10,623 --> 00:52:13,695
Clear

1045
00:52:15,231 --> 00:52:15,743
Cheez-It

1046
00:52:17,535 --> 00:52:19,583
Certified naturopath

1047
00:52:19,839 --> 00:52:22,399
That's pretty awesome

1048
00:52:28,287 --> 00:52:29,567
Here's another little bit of

1049
00:52:31,615 --> 00:52:34,431
Doctorate of naturopathy from the International School

1050
00:52:34,687 --> 00:52:37,759
Masterpass in Los Altos California

1051
00:52:40,831 --> 00:52:46,975
Google

1052
00:52:47,231 --> 00:52:52,351
Chapathi in Los Altos California

1053
00:52:53,119 --> 00:52:54,911
It's not even the University of Phoenix online

1054
00:52:55,167 --> 00:53:01,311
Even more interesting you don't even find reviews of a fake school or website

1055
00:53:07,967 --> 00:53:14,111
Mailing address

1056
00:53:14,367 --> 00:53:19,231
Psyche look into any of

1057
00:53:19,487 --> 00:53:24,863
Here's the course now you can take it we're not

1058
00:53:25,375 --> 00:53:25,887
That's where the thing

1059
00:53:26,399 --> 00:53:26,911
In fact

1060
00:53:27,167 --> 00:53:28,959
If you Google the name of the school

1061
00:53:29,215 --> 00:53:30,751
All you will find our links

1062
00:53:31,007 --> 00:53:36,383
To dr. Scott Whitaker in his book medicine

1063
00:53:36,639 --> 00:53:38,943
Appeared

1064
00:53:44,831 --> 00:53:45,855
Grip

1065
00:53:46,111 --> 00:53:49,695
Confirm this but it appears that the only place this name for a school

1066
00:53:50,975 --> 00:53:51,999
Is in his bio

1067
00:53:57,375 --> 00:54:01,983
Not the fun part about this

1068
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:08,127
Did you know that I have that the fun part about this

1069
00:54:08,383 --> 00:54:10,943
Most natural path doctor

1070
00:54:12,479 --> 00:54:14,015
Realized

1071
00:54:15,039 --> 00:54:16,063
The very real threat

1072
00:54:16,575 --> 00:54:17,855
I decided to cut out the middleman

1073
00:54:18,111 --> 00:54:20,415
Just make up a school

1074
00:54:28,607 --> 00:54:29,375
Thousands of dollars

1075
00:54:29,631 --> 00:54:30,143
To get it

1076
00:54:30,399 --> 00:54:34,751
Even if it's just a couple

1077
00:54:35,263 --> 00:54:36,031
Still saving

1078
00:54:36,287 --> 00:54:41,407
You shouldn't even really have to pay tikos just print it out on your home printer

1079
00:54:41,919 --> 00:54:42,431
Did that

1080
00:54:54,975 --> 00:54:57,535
Ginkgo biloba

1081
00:54:59,071 --> 00:54:59,583

Detoxification

1085
00:55:03,679 --> 00:55:05,983
Sound trustworthy

1086
00:55:06,239 --> 00:55:07,519
About 9 country study

1087
00:55:07,775 --> 00:55:09,311
Ceiling fans over Naf

1088
00:55:09,567 --> 00:55:12,383
Janasia bringing them back to America and using them and applying

1089
00:55:13,151 --> 00:55:14,431
Phenomenal results

1090
00:55:14,943 --> 00:55:15,711
Everyone

1091
00:55:15,967 --> 00:55:16,991
Contact weird recording

1092
00:55:20,319 --> 00:55:21,855
Which

1093
00:55:24,159 --> 00:55:24,927
Approach

1094
00:55:25,183 --> 00:55:25,695
The healing

1095
00:55:25,951 --> 00:55:26,975
Is the only way I go

1096
00:55:32,095 --> 00:55:33,375
Nothing but a death trap

1097
00:55:36,703 --> 00:55:38,751
To do anything else except for go that route

1098
00:55:39,007 --> 00:55:39,519
But

1099
00:55:39,775 --> 00:55:40,799
Real Hospital

1100
00:55:41,823 --> 00:55:42,335
That sounds right

1101
00:55:43,615 --> 00:55:45,151
They do have a high rate of infection

1102
00:55:45,407 --> 00:55:45,919
Deathtrap

1103
00:55:46,943 --> 00:55:49,247
What if you break your leg strap

1104
00:55:51,807 --> 00:55:53,343
Because it is next clip

1105
00:55:53,599 --> 00:55:57,439
He does explain Whittaker does explain but there are some instances

1106
00:55:57,951 --> 00:55:58,975
Wearing you should go to office

1107
00:55:59,999 --> 00:56:00,767
But the hospitals are

1108
00:56:01,023 --> 00:56:01,791
Set up there all

1109
00:56:02,815 --> 00:56:03,327
Set up

1110
00:56:03,583 --> 00:56:04,351
A drug charge

1111
00:56:05,375 --> 00:56:06,399
The only

1112
00:56:06,655 --> 00:56:09,983
Reason or purpose to throw everyone go to hospital

1113
00:56:10,239 --> 00:56:10,751
4

1114
00:56:11,007 --> 00:56:12,031
Emergency

1115
00:56:12,287 --> 00:56:13,055
Emergencies

1116
00:56:15,615 --> 00:56:21,759
Amputation

1117
00:56:23,295 --> 00:56:25,599
You can forget it there is no cure ever

1118
00:56:31,487 --> 00:56:36,607
Yeah except or gunshot

1119
00:56:39,679 --> 00:56:40,703
No reason given

1120
00:56:40,959 --> 00:56:47,103
I think it really goes without saying that like this is a really dangerous line of thought

1121
00:56:47,359 --> 00:56:49,663
Really f***** up for Alex

1122
00:56:49,919 --> 00:56:50,431
Because

1123
00:56:50,943 --> 00:56:53,247
There's so much more that hospitals do

1124
00:56:53,503 --> 00:56:55,807
Just because you wanted demonize Diane

1125
00:56:56,063 --> 00:56:57,087
Because you're afraid that

1126
00:56:57,343 --> 00:56:58,623
You know I don't know regulations

1127
00:56:58,879 --> 00:57:00,159
Things are going to start popping up

1128
00:57:00,415 --> 00:57:02,207
Make your scams untenable

1129
00:57:02,463 --> 00:57:03,231
Or illegal

1130
00:57:03,487 --> 00:57:03,999
To pull off

1131
00:57:04,255 --> 00:57:10,399
I don't know that they aren't already create a Grassroots

1132
00:57:10,655 --> 00:57:12,447
Awakening of people who are

1133
00:57:12,703 --> 00:57:13,727
Think the doctor is

1134
00:57:13,983 --> 00:57:17,823
Some hospitals just be a deathtrap

1135
00:57:18,079 --> 00:57:20,895
You know there's so much preventive medicine that is saved

1136
00:57:21,151 --> 00:57:22,431
Millions of lives

1137
00:57:22,687 --> 00:57:24,223
Over the years that have nothing to do with

1138
00:57:24,735 --> 00:57:26,527
Crisis emergency

1139
00:57:27,039 --> 00:57:27,551
Medicine

1140
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:31,391
This is this is a ludicrous thing for someone to be saying it

1141
00:57:32,159 --> 00:57:33,439
Borders on

1142
00:57:33,695 --> 00:57:34,207
Gleefully Danger

1143
00:57:34,463 --> 00:57:37,279
Ill-advised

1144
00:57:37,791 --> 00:57:43,167
At the very things that he's describing the hospitals do

1145
00:57:43,423 --> 00:57:44,191
Also include

1146
00:57:44,447 --> 00:57:48,287
The other things that hospital it's not like a surgery is just

1147
00:57:48,543 --> 00:57:50,847
They

1148
00:57:51,103 --> 00:57:53,151
World all surgeries are just a Tatian

1149
00:57:53,407 --> 00:57:56,991
Like your break it like they're just like

1150
00:57:57,247 --> 00:57:59,551
Performing a surgery

1151
00:57:59,807 --> 00:58:04,159
Involved involved

1152
00:58:04,415 --> 00:58:10,559
And also usually means

1153
00:58:10,815 --> 00:58:16,959
How to control infection and maybe frostbite

1154
00:58:17,215 --> 00:58:20,799
Holistic medicine

1155
00:58:28,991 --> 00:58:31,039
That's not to say that like

1156
00:58:33,087 --> 00:58:33,599
Are medical

1157
00:58:33,855 --> 00:58:36,159
Call system even take out the financial last

1158
00:58:38,207 --> 00:58:38,719
It works

1159
00:58:38,975 --> 00:58:41,535
Every time we got it all down

1160
00:58:41,791 --> 00:58:42,303
But it is

1161
00:58:42,559 --> 00:58:45,119
Far and Away better than your herb nonsense

1162
00:58:45,375 --> 00:58:47,423
Yeah

1163
00:58:47,679 --> 00:58:48,447
Holistic medicine

1164
00:58:48,703 --> 00:58:49,983
Stop.

1165
00:58:50,239 --> 00:58:51,775
Placebos

1166
00:58:52,031 --> 00:58:54,591
There's that part of results

1167
00:58:57,663 --> 00:59:03,807
I support structure

1168
00:59:04,063 --> 00:59:06,879
Dua LIPA

1169
00:59:07,135 --> 00:59:09,439
It's not right to demonize all of it

1170
00:59:09,695 --> 00:59:10,207
But there was

1171
00:59:11,487 --> 00:59:13,535
Like an old Loveline episodes dr. Drew

1172
00:59:16,095 --> 00:59:17,631
If all of this

1173
00:59:17,887 --> 00:59:18,911
Herb base

1174
00:59:19,167 --> 00:59:20,447
Natural healing

1175
00:59:20,703 --> 00:59:21,215
Work

1176
00:59:21,727 --> 00:59:25,567
There would be no reason that medicine would have ever developed

1177
00:59:25,823 --> 00:59:30,175
There is no reason that you would have ever come up with all this stuff no one would have studied

1178
00:59:30,687 --> 00:59:32,479
B H & H

1179
00:59:33,503 --> 00:59:36,575
Failed experiments that lead to the 1641

1180
00:59:36,831 --> 00:59:40,927
If all of it was already taken care of

1181
00:59:41,183 --> 00:59:43,999
It's got to be took

1182
00:59:44,255 --> 00:59:45,279
Memories

1183
00:59:45,791 --> 00:59:47,839
Epic Madison

1184
00:59:48,095 --> 00:59:49,887
In order to have a monopoly

1185
00:59:50,143 --> 00:59:55,007
But they don't really want a monopoly on medicine for healing

1186
00:59:55,263 --> 00:59:56,543
They want it for deathtrap

1187
00:59:58,591 --> 01:00:01,663
A lot of nickels to create MRI machine

1188
01:00:02,175 --> 01:00:03,455
Yeah

1189
01:00:07,807 --> 01:00:08,319
Natural

1190
01:00:08,575 --> 01:00:09,087
Cures

1191
01:00:09,343 --> 01:00:11,135
And stuff probably did help

1192
01:00:11,391 --> 01:00:12,671
A lot more in

1193
01:00:13,183 --> 01:00:14,207
Earlier time

1194
01:00:14,719 --> 01:00:15,231
Japan history

1195
01:00:15,743 --> 01:00:17,279
But

1196
01:00:17,535 --> 01:00:18,047
More

1197
01:00:18,815 --> 01:00:19,327
Pollution

1198
01:00:19,583 --> 01:00:20,351
More

1199
01:00:23,679 --> 01:00:24,191
Change.

1200
01:00:24,447 --> 01:00:24,959
Conditions that

1201
01:00:25,471 --> 01:00:25,983
Have changed

1202
01:00:26,239 --> 01:00:27,007
Because of

1203
01:00:28,031 --> 01:00:28,799
Assertive

1204
01:00:29,055 --> 01:00:29,567
Human

1205
01:00:30,847 --> 01:00:31,871
World interaction

1206
01:00:32,127 --> 01:00:32,895
But we have inner tubes

1207
01:00:33,919 --> 01:00:34,943
The things like smallpox

1208
01:00:35,455 --> 01:00:36,735
To everyone

1209
01:00:36,991 --> 01:00:39,295
All those things didn't necessarily exist

1210
01:00:39,551 --> 01:00:40,319
Before

1211
01:00:40,575 --> 01:00:41,599
They probably wouldn't have been

1212
01:00:41,855 --> 01:00:42,879
Natural medicine

1213
01:00:44,927 --> 01:00:50,047
Nothing we could do about that

1214
01:00:50,303 --> 01:00:51,327
Which is kind of the same thing

1215
01:00:52,607 --> 01:00:55,679
Mr.

1216
01:00:55,935 --> 01:00:58,239
Put that on my side

1217
01:00:59,775 --> 01:01:02,335
Board certified by made-up nonsense

1218
01:01:02,591 --> 01:01:03,103
Second

1219
01:01:03,359 --> 01:01:06,175
I'm a chance over you while you die

1220
01:01:07,967 --> 01:01:08,479
Who said it was

1221
01:01:09,247 --> 01:01:11,039
What's Google it

1222
01:01:11,295 --> 01:01:13,087
You can't trust that

1223
01:01:13,599 --> 01:01:14,367
Have revenant

1224
01:01:14,879 --> 01:01:15,647
Like

Version of

1228
01:01:20,255 --> 01:01:21,023
Oh that's what they say

1229
01:01:23,071 --> 01:01:25,375
His bio

1230
01:01:25,631 --> 01:01:28,959
You're absolutely right

1231
01:01:29,215 --> 01:01:29,727
Why would you

1232
01:01:29,983 --> 01:01:33,055
Pay somebody for the fake degree when you can just make it up your

1233
01:01:33,311 --> 01:01:34,591
Self

1234
01:01:34,847 --> 01:01:35,359
To the same problem

1235
01:01:36,639 --> 01:01:37,151
Real fake

1236
01:01:40,223 --> 01:01:45,599
Have the pretend authority to stay there

1237
01:01:46,111 --> 01:01:48,415
People who may need actual medical advice

1238
01:01:48,671 --> 01:01:53,791
I just don't see the difference between

1239
01:01:54,303 --> 01:01:56,095
No I agree they have the same problem

1240
01:01:58,911 --> 01:01:59,679
Saudia

1241
01:02:00,191 --> 01:02:00,959
Whitaker w

1242
01:02:01,471 --> 01:02:02,495
You give

1243
01:02:04,031 --> 01:02:04,543
Analogy

1244
01:02:05,567 --> 01:02:08,127
Start of a condemnation of the medical establishment

1245
01:02:08,895 --> 01:02:09,663
And it's really into

1246
01:02:10,431 --> 01:02:11,199
The way you phrases

1247
01:02:12,223 --> 01:02:12,735
Petco

1248
01:02:14,015 --> 01:02:15,039
There is no cure

1249
01:02:15,295 --> 01:02:16,063
Are becoming

1250
01:02:16,319 --> 01:02:17,087
The medical establishment

1251
01:02:17,343 --> 01:02:18,623
If they don't want a cure

1252
01:02:18,879 --> 01:02:20,159
Keep you

1253
01:02:23,999 --> 01:02:25,279
Play can drain your account

1254
01:02:25,791 --> 01:02:26,303
New it

1255
01:02:26,559 --> 01:02:27,327
Can you often

1256
01:02:27,583 --> 01:02:28,095
The grave

1257
01:02:30,655 --> 01:02:31,423
You're right

1258
01:02:34,495 --> 01:02:36,287
I love a good

1259
01:02:36,543 --> 01:02:39,615
I love a good Alex doesn't have anything to say so he says

1260
01:02:40,383 --> 01:02:41,663
You're right

1261
01:02:41,919 --> 01:02:43,967
So I wanted you to pay close attention to that because

1262
01:02:44,479 --> 01:02:44,991
Interesting

1263
01:02:46,271 --> 01:02:46,783
Conception

1264
01:02:47,551 --> 01:02:48,831
For that is the idea

1265
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:50,111
ChapStick and

1266
01:02:50,367 --> 01:02:51,903
Healthy

1267
01:02:52,159 --> 01:02:52,927
Keep you in a state where they can

1268
01:02:53,439 --> 01:02:54,207
In your bank account

1269
01:02:54,463 --> 01:02:55,743
Now let's look at Alex Jones

1270
01:02:56,255 --> 01:02:57,279
What he does is

1271
01:02:57,535 --> 01:03:00,095
Is keeps his audience in the state where they're constantly

1272
01:03:00,351 --> 01:03:01,375
About to be

1273
01:03:01,631 --> 01:03:05,983
The victims of genocide is over the

1274
01:03:06,239 --> 01:03:06,751
These genocide

1275
01:03:07,007 --> 01:03:07,775
Eugenics courses

1276
01:03:08,031 --> 01:03:09,055
I don't understand your point

1277
01:03:09,311 --> 01:03:11,615
He keeps them in a half alive half a flea

1278
01:03:11,871 --> 01:03:15,455
State or whatever had doesn't sound healthy

1279
01:03:15,711 --> 01:03:16,479
From a

1280
01:03:16,735 --> 01:03:18,271
Worldview stamp in order

1281
01:03:19,039 --> 01:03:20,319
Bentley keep them on board in

1282
01:03:20,575 --> 01:03:21,343
Scared enough

1283
01:03:21,599 --> 01:03:23,647
That they are motivated to buy things

1284
01:03:24,159 --> 01:03:25,695
But Victorious and

1285
01:03:26,207 --> 01:03:27,999
That they don't feel like it's pointless

1286
01:03:30,303 --> 01:03:31,327
Who is

1287
01:03:31,583 --> 01:03:33,375
In the Bank of Big Hoss

1288
01:03:33,887 --> 01:03:38,751
That's what you're saying right there is propaganda for pro hospitals

1289
01:03:39,007 --> 01:03:40,031
You are just

1290
01:03:40,287 --> 01:03:46,431
Making these wild connections groups fakes

1291
01:03:46,687 --> 01:03:52,831
F****** supplement

1292
01:03:53,087 --> 01:03:55,391
Little thinking you're suppressing Hospital

1293
01:03:55,647 --> 01:03:56,671
I want you out of

1294
01:03:57,183 --> 01:04:00,511
Mnsshp

1295
01:04:00,767 --> 01:04:04,095
Just to be very clear

1296
01:04:04,351 --> 01:04:10,495
Beyond Tangy Tangerine

1297
01:04:10,751 --> 01:04:12,543
Mariah is not a doctor for human

1298
01:04:13,055 --> 01:04:14,591
No shortage of Griff

1299
01:04:22,271 --> 01:04:23,807
It's still just

1300
01:04:24,319 --> 01:04:26,879
Hey man

1301
01:04:27,135 --> 01:04:27,647
Stillgoode

1302
01:04:28,159 --> 01:04:28,671
Still works

1303
01:04:28,927 --> 01:04:29,439
Fine

1304
01:04:30,975 --> 01:04:33,023
He's presenting like some dangerous ideas

1305
01:04:33,279 --> 01:04:35,327
And then also an interesting metaphor

1306
01:04:35,839 --> 01:04:37,631
Accidentally sums up Alex's business

1307
01:04:39,423 --> 01:04:39,935
If it's next

1308
01:04:40,703 --> 01:04:42,239
Whitaker crosses the line

1309
01:04:42,751 --> 01:04:44,031
Severely.

1310
01:04:44,287 --> 01:04:45,055
Dangerous stupid

1311
01:04:46,335 --> 01:04:47,615
Didn't want to come out

1312
01:04:47,871 --> 01:04:48,383
Give this

1313
01:04:48,639 --> 01:04:49,663
Duraseal

1314
01:04:50,175 --> 01:04:51,199
Little girls

1315
01:04:51,455 --> 01:04:52,223
Major nine

1316
01:04:52,735 --> 01:04:56,575
In 26 program

1317
01:04:57,087 --> 01:04:58,111
And

1318
01:04:58,367 --> 01:04:59,391
The body that's

1319
01:04:59,903 --> 01:05:00,415
Gets rid of

1320
01:05:00,671 --> 01:05:01,439
The so-called HP

1321
01:05:08,351 --> 01:05:09,119
Problems

1322
01:05:09,375 --> 01:05:14,239
This is real

1323
01:05:14,495 --> 01:05:20,639
So wait so the fake doctor with a fake degree from it

1324
01:05:20,895 --> 01:05:26,271
Naturally get rid of HPV bumps

1325
01:05:28,063 --> 01:05:34,207
See how not real it is it only killed 3,000 people a year

1326
01:05:34,719 --> 01:05:40,863
That doesn't make sense it's actually get rid of it already have autoimmune disorders

1327
01:05:41,119 --> 01:05:47,263
Autoimmune disorders

1328
01:05:47,519 --> 01:05:49,055
What is it it's a precursor for cervical can

1329
01:05:49,567 --> 01:05:51,359
Women's

1330
01:05:52,895 --> 01:05:54,175
Because as recently as the knights

1331
01:05:54,431 --> 01:05:54,943
50

1332
01:05:55,199 --> 01:05:57,503
Cervical cancer was a leading cause of death in adults

1333
01:05:58,527 --> 01:05:59,807
In the 50s the pap smear was in

1334
01:06:00,063 --> 01:06:00,831
Stardew switch

1335
01:06:01,087 --> 01:06:02,367
Too much earlier diagnosis of

1336
01:06:02,623 --> 01:06:04,671
Weather condition and the number of deaths went down

1337
01:06:06,207 --> 01:06:06,975
Protective

1338
01:06:07,231 --> 01:06:09,279
Stevie got the ability to essentially eliminate

1339
01:06:09,535 --> 01:06:10,047
The Fatal risk

1340
01:06:10,815 --> 01:06:16,191
Now it's just turning our girls into slots Dan

1341
01:06:16,447 --> 01:06:19,519
Whitaker says it's a sterilization Tech

1342
01:06:20,543 --> 01:06:21,823
Dependent premise

1343
01:06:22,335 --> 01:06:24,383
Oh I believe it

1344
01:06:25,151 --> 01:06:29,759
Fine that's not what a doctor would say everybody who's gotten Gardasil so far

1345
01:06:30,015 --> 01:06:36,159
Has become sterile within two to three days

1346
01:06:36,415 --> 01:06:37,183
Notion

1347
01:06:37,439 --> 01:06:39,487
Irresponsible stay I just believe this

1348
01:06:39,743 --> 01:06:41,791
I believe you need an amputation

1349
01:06:42,047 --> 01:06:43,071
Which is why you came to the

1350
01:06:43,583 --> 01:06:49,727
So Alex trots out that only 3,000 deaths occur annually from HPV number is closer to like 4

1351
01:06:49,983 --> 01:06:50,751
For 5000

1352
01:06:51,263 --> 01:06:52,543
And I'd only reflects the United

1353
01:06:53,567 --> 01:06:54,847
That's only because

1354
01:06:55,103 --> 01:06:57,151
His Maiden screening and detection in the years since then

1355
01:06:57,663 --> 01:06:58,175
Q50

1356
01:06:58,431 --> 01:06:59,711
Since which time the incident

1357
01:06:59,967 --> 01:07:00,735
Death rate for server

1358
01:07:01,247 --> 01:07:02,527
Panthers dropped about 60%

1359
01:07:02,783 --> 01:07:05,599
I understand the grammatically

1360
01:07:05,855 --> 01:07:09,695
Since which time is correct however I heard it

1361
01:07:11,231 --> 01:07:14,303
The drop that

1362
01:07:14,559 --> 01:07:19,167
The state for hbv is it wasn't thanks to holistic medicine or natural

1363
01:07:19,935 --> 01:07:23,007
It was thanks to the development of the pap smear the dedicated researcher

1364
01:07:23,519 --> 01:07:24,031
I figured out how

1365
01:07:24,543 --> 01:07:25,055
BV causes

1366
01:07:26,591 --> 01:07:28,383
And the folks has now developed a vaccine

1367
01:07:28,895 --> 01:07:30,175
The only reason Alex

1368
01:07:30,431 --> 01:07:32,735
Flippantly pretend to 3000 annual deaths

1369
01:07:32,991 --> 01:07:37,087
You know you could have talked that around in order to make it seem like it's not a big deal

1370
01:07:37,343 --> 01:07:39,903
It's because of the work of the very people him and Whitaker

1371
01:07:40,159 --> 01:07:41,951
Here are trying to demonize

1372
01:07:42,719 --> 01:07:44,255
It's very very stupid

1373
01:07:45,791 --> 01:07:47,327
Dangerous

1374
01:07:47,839 --> 01:07:50,143
Buy mentality to put out

1375
01:07:50,399 --> 01:07:51,679
What you have to back it up

1376
01:07:51,935 --> 01:07:53,471
I believe that this is the case

1377
01:07:54,239 --> 01:07:55,519
Sterilization Tech

1378
01:07:55,775 --> 01:07:57,311
And not about trying to

1379
01:07:57,567 --> 01:07:58,591
Make sure that

1380
01:07:59,103 --> 01:07:59,871
We have a

1381
01:08:00,127 --> 01:08:01,151
Completely

1382
01:08:01,919 --> 01:08:02,431
Like

1383
01:08:02,687 --> 01:08:03,199
We could get rid of

1384
01:08:03,967 --> 01:08:06,527
What protects the process by which this s***

1385
01:08:06,783 --> 01:08:07,807
Always works with

1386
01:08:08,063 --> 01:08:11,135
With how Humanities stupid humanity is

1387
01:08:11,391 --> 01:08:15,487
It is a massive problem and we spend all this time and effort

1388
01:08:15,743 --> 01:08:18,815
Trying to fix it and as we get closer and closer to

1389
01:08:19,071 --> 01:08:19,583
A solution

1390
01:08:19,839 --> 01:08:21,375
It stops being a massive problem

1391
01:08:21,631 --> 01:08:24,703
And the people for whom it was a massive problem are dead

1392
01:08:24,959 --> 01:08:26,751
So the next generation is like

1393
01:08:27,007 --> 01:08:32,639
B it's not a problem and it never was and nobody's ever fixed it

1394
01:08:32,895 --> 01:08:33,407
For men

1395
01:08:33,663 --> 01:08:34,687
Lake HPV dozen

1396
01:08:34,943 --> 01:08:38,271
I'm sure that didn't

1397
01:08:38,527 --> 01:08:40,575
So

1398
01:08:40,831 --> 01:08:43,647
The body takes care of cervical

1399
01:08:43,903 --> 01:08:47,487
What do you might be expressing is just the idea that form and it doesn't really matter

1400
01:08:47,743 --> 01:08:51,839
That's like saying that for abortion doesn't really matter

1401
01:08:52,095 --> 01:08:52,863
That sounds crazy

1402
01:08:53,119 --> 01:08:53,631
Weird

1403
01:08:56,959 --> 01:08:59,775
Really dangerous but some of them are just outright

1404
01:09:00,031 --> 01:09:00,799
Wacky stupid

1405
01:09:01,055 --> 01:09:01,567
Like this next

1406
01:09:02,591 --> 01:09:03,615
You never want to bring

1407
01:09:03,871 --> 01:09:04,895
Cut roses

1408
01:09:05,151 --> 01:09:05,919
Someone that you're visiting

1409
01:09:07,455 --> 01:09:08,223
The essence of death

1410
01:09:08,991 --> 01:09:10,527
So you want me to bring a live play

1411
01:09:12,319 --> 01:09:14,111
Hospital the MD DMD

1412
01:09:14,623 --> 01:09:15,903
Who is considered by most

1413
01:09:16,159 --> 01:09:16,671
As a guy

1414
01:09:18,719 --> 01:09:21,791
Misdirected

1415
01:09:23,583 --> 01:09:25,119
Cut flowers

1416
01:09:25,375 --> 01:09:26,911
York Zoo

1417
01:09:28,447 --> 01:09:28,959
Attracts

1418
01:09:29,215 --> 01:09:31,519
Don't bring rocks those aren't alive

1419
01:09:33,311 --> 01:09:33,823
Wood

1420
01:09:34,079 --> 01:09:39,199
Probably need to study the back into the priesthood

1421
01:09:39,455 --> 01:09:43,039
That's why in d.c.

1422
01:09:43,295 --> 01:09:46,111
Fun with words

1423
01:09:47,647 --> 01:09:50,719
I folded up a twenty-dollar bill and saw that hospitals are deaf

1424
01:09:50,975 --> 01:09:55,327
You would need to do a study of people who are brought flowers and vases

1425
01:09:55,583 --> 01:10:01,215
Cut flowers do that study because you'd be endangering

1426
01:10:01,471 --> 01:10:07,103
Poopy and in ethical study to

1427
01:10:07,359 --> 01:10:13,503
Yes I would agree with you Dad everybody in the medical community agreed

1428
01:10:13,759 --> 01:10:15,551
Bringing cut flowers was a risk

1429
01:10:15,807 --> 01:10:18,879
Then the study itself would of course be on

1430
01:10:21,183 --> 01:10:27,327
Everybody is like

1431
01:10:27,583 --> 01:10:33,727
Exude is a degree with objectivity

1432
01:10:33,983 --> 01:10:34,751
Study being done

1433
01:10:37,055 --> 01:10:37,823
Hey now

1434
01:10:38,079 --> 01:10:40,127
You're possibly killing patients

1435
01:10:40,639 --> 01:10:43,199
Crazy

1436
01:10:44,991 --> 01:10:46,527
So we see the other sort of stuff that he

1437
01:10:47,807 --> 01:10:48,319
Insanity

1438
01:10:50,111 --> 01:10:51,391
You know early in the show

1439
01:10:51,647 --> 01:10:52,927
Alex started out talk

1440
01:10:53,183 --> 01:10:53,951
Think about things that made it

1441
01:10:54,207 --> 01:10:54,719
It's very clear that

1442
01:10:54,975 --> 01:10:55,743
The Sovereign citizen

1443
01:10:56,255 --> 01:10:58,047
Well guess what so is dr. Whitaker

1444
01:10:58,815 --> 01:11:04,959
Import

1445
01:11:06,751 --> 01:11:11,615
And that's all

1446
01:11:11,871 --> 01:11:12,639
Oh yes no doubt

1447
01:11:14,431 --> 01:11:16,735
Systems under the British admiralty regulation

1448
01:11:18,271 --> 01:11:20,319
And almost at the goalposts of the year

1449
01:11:20,575 --> 01:11:21,599
Flags of goldfinches

1450
01:11:22,367 --> 01:11:23,391
Good boy

1451
01:11:23,647 --> 01:11:24,415
Hospital

1452
01:11:26,463 --> 01:11:28,255
Yeah that's that's that's

1453
01:11:30,303 --> 01:11:34,911
I just want to run through some of the stupidity

1454
01:11:35,679 --> 01:11:36,191
Insole

1455
01:11:37,471 --> 01:11:37,983
Can you go in and

1456
01:11:38,239 --> 01:11:40,799
You're going to do some you still using your hmos and

1457
01:11:41,055 --> 01:11:43,359
And all these different Health Spanish

1458
01:11:43,615 --> 01:11:46,431
Basement Systems that's what they are they there to manage or disease

1459
01:11:47,455 --> 01:11:48,479
You got to be aware that

1460
01:11:48,735 --> 01:11:49,247
When you go in

1461
01:11:50,015 --> 01:11:50,783
It's like a recruitment

1462
01:11:52,063 --> 01:11:53,087
Scaring Detroit

1463
01:11:53,343 --> 01:11:54,111
Fear

1464
01:11:54,623 --> 01:11:55,903
AR

1465
01:11:56,159 --> 01:11:56,671
Getting real

1466
01:11:57,951 --> 01:11:58,463
Call boy

1467
01:11:59,231 --> 01:12:02,047
If you turned it into an acronym it must be true Dan

1468
01:12:02,303 --> 01:12:04,351
That's something that I remember

1469
01:12:04,607 --> 01:12:08,447
From Gary Busey saying all the time

1470
01:12:08,703 --> 01:12:14,335
And I also have heard that note

1471
01:12:14,591 --> 01:12:16,383
For everything

1472
01:12:16,895 --> 01:12:19,967
Is it a gentleman who does

1473
01:12:20,223 --> 01:12:24,575
Does a million acronyms for literally every possible thing

1474
01:12:26,111 --> 01:12:30,463
You did not tell me he would do that all over VH1 television

1475
01:12:31,743 --> 01:12:34,047
In the years when I was watching a saint of it

1476
01:12:35,839 --> 01:12:37,631
You just get the sense that this guy is coming

1477
01:12:37,887 --> 01:12:38,399
From NADA healthy

1478
01:12:39,167 --> 01:12:39,679
Ironically

1479
01:12:41,983 --> 01:12:42,751
But

1480
01:12:43,263 --> 01:12:43,775
We do get

1481
01:12:44,287 --> 01:12:47,103
You know what this sounds so much like

1482
01:12:47,359 --> 01:12:48,895
Doing this right now this sounds like

1483
01:12:49,663 --> 01:12:50,431
Like daytime

1484
01:12:50,943 --> 01:12:57,087
TV for Eno like mom's watching.

1485
01:12:57,343 --> 01:13:00,671
Hicksville

1486
01:13:01,183 --> 01:13:07,071
What are they what are they doing this is

1487
01:13:07,839 --> 01:13:08,351
I'm here at the end

1488
01:13:08,863 --> 01:13:09,887
Because what happens is

1489
01:13:10,399 --> 01:13:11,423
An actual doctor calls

1490
01:13:11,935 --> 01:13:16,287
An oncologist

1491
01:13:16,543 --> 01:13:17,055
He wants

1492
01:13:17,311 --> 01:13:23,455
Point out that this is bad guys I Googled yours and

1493
01:13:27,039 --> 01:13:29,855
My phone number is much nicer than someone asking

1494
01:13:30,111 --> 01:13:30,879
That kind of question

1495
01:13:31,903 --> 01:13:33,695
You're on the air of Scott

1496
01:13:34,719 --> 01:13:35,487
Hi

1497
01:13:35,743 --> 01:13:38,303
You know I think the world was not so black-and-white

1498
01:13:38,815 --> 01:13:39,839
As so you're guessing

1499
01:13:42,399 --> 01:13:44,703
And there's a 90% cure rate

1500
01:13:44,959 --> 01:13:45,471
4

1501
01:13:45,983 --> 01:13:47,263
Testicular cancer Young

1502
01:13:47,519 --> 01:13:48,031
Guy has to

1503
01:13:48,287 --> 01:13:49,311
Testicular cancer

1504
01:13:49,567 --> 01:13:50,591
Because you listen

1505
01:13:50,847 --> 01:13:52,639
Does not go to a doctor

1506
01:13:52,895 --> 01:13:54,687
Good chance he's going to die

1507
01:13:55,711 --> 01:13:56,991
Does your guest have that kind of

1508
01:13:57,503 --> 01:13:58,271
Treatments

1509
01:13:59,039 --> 01:14:01,087
That's what your vitamins I don't think so

1510
01:14:01,855 --> 01:14:05,183
So you brings up a very good point

1511
01:14:05,439 --> 01:14:09,791
Heard the man say oncologist in then he disappears in a puff of

1512
01:14:10,047 --> 01:14:11,071
Smoke like a cartoon

1513
01:14:11,327 --> 01:14:13,887
What's

1514
01:14:14,143 --> 01:14:17,471
That is that this is dangerous

1515
01:14:21,055 --> 01:14:21,823
Put some kind of like

1516
01:14:22,079 --> 01:14:23,871
Studies research that you've done

1517
01:14:24,127 --> 01:14:24,639
A review

1518
01:14:25,151 --> 01:14:25,663
Formation

1519
01:14:26,175 --> 01:14:27,199
And I'm telling you

1520
01:14:27,711 --> 01:14:28,479
We don't have

1521
01:14:29,759 --> 01:14:30,527
This doctor called

1522
01:14:30,783 --> 01:14:31,551
Incredibly Fair

1523
01:14:32,063 --> 01:14:32,831
He keeps saying like

1524
01:14:33,087 --> 01:14:35,135
I believe that there is a place for holistic

1525
01:14:35,391 --> 01:14:35,903
Approaches

1526
01:14:36,159 --> 01:14:38,975
There are people who incorporate it really well and

1527
01:14:39,231 --> 01:14:39,743
Have shown

1528
01:14:39,999 --> 01:14:41,023
Some techno

1529
01:14:41,535 --> 01:14:42,047
Do you have

1530
01:14:42,303 --> 01:14:43,839
Some appropriate application

1531
01:14:44,351 --> 01:14:48,191
He's not coming into being like you're full of s***

1532
01:14:48,959 --> 01:14:50,495
If someone who could

1533
01:14:50,751 --> 01:14:51,519
Be helped with early

1534
01:14:51,775 --> 01:14:52,287
Detection of

1535
01:14:52,543 --> 01:14:53,055
Eye cancer

1536
01:14:53,311 --> 01:14:53,823
Let's say

1537
01:14:54,335 --> 01:14:56,127
Doesn't do it because he believes this guy

1538
01:14:56,639 --> 01:14:57,151
He might die

1539
01:14:57,407 --> 01:14:58,431
You might be killing me

1540
01:15:03,551 --> 01:15:06,623
Stick Euler cancer has a 90% cure

1541
01:15:06,879 --> 01:15:08,159
Deathtrap medicine

1542
01:15:08,415 --> 01:15:09,695
Do you know what I have

1543
01:15:09,951 --> 01:15:10,719
Fish oil

1544
01:15:10,975 --> 01:15:13,791
1%

1545
01:15:15,071 --> 01:15:16,351
You're not far off.

1546
01:15:16,607 --> 01:15:18,911
You're not far off from Whitakers words

1547
01:15:24,543 --> 01:15:30,687
Polymyxin was Justice with cancer and who's the other one in the phone when I'm done both of those hundred percent pure race so

1548
01:15:33,759 --> 01:15:39,903
I highly doubt that

1549
01:15:40,159 --> 01:15:40,671
Call trial

1550
01:15:41,183 --> 01:15:42,719
I got to be responsible study

1551
01:15:43,231 --> 01:15:44,255
Behind that

1552
01:15:46,815 --> 01:15:47,583
First Easter

1553
01:15:47,839 --> 01:15:49,631
I need to research

1554
01:15:56,543 --> 01:16:01,663
Well I mean you know I would like to have drop is studying so I can

1555
01:16:01,919 --> 01:16:08,063
Medical studies

1556
01:16:11,135 --> 01:16:12,927
Yes but there's a lot of synthetic

1557
01:16:13,183 --> 01:16:15,231
Vitamin studies that have been negative lately

1558
01:16:15,743 --> 01:16:19,071
So I love that response

1559
01:16:19,327 --> 01:16:22,143
I don't why don't you believe

1560
01:16:22,399 --> 01:16:24,959
I don't I don't think it will occur understand how science

1561
01:16:25,215 --> 01:16:29,311
A studies were or peer-reviewed

1562
01:16:29,567 --> 01:16:32,383
Statistics I understand

1563
01:16:33,919 --> 01:16:34,431
You think

1564
01:16:34,687 --> 01:16:40,831
Everyone who's ever come to him it's been healed because he has maybe they don't believe it

1565
01:16:42,367 --> 01:16:46,463
The patients

1566
01:16:46,719 --> 01:16:49,023
At this is crazy

1567
01:16:49,279 --> 01:16:53,375
The invite

1568
01:16:53,631 --> 01:16:56,703
Success rate for testicular cancer I got a hundred percent success rate

1569
01:16:58,495 --> 01:17:04,639
I would like to see your statistics on that listen to this arrogant

1570
01:17:07,711 --> 01:17:10,527
Peer-reviewed answered hippie like

1571
01:17:10,783 --> 01:17:13,855
Why don't you trust me I believe what you're saying the internet

1572
01:17:14,111 --> 01:17:14,879
You shouldn't

1573
01:17:17,183 --> 01:17:19,487
Because whenever

1574
01:17:19,743 --> 01:17:21,535
Everybody else's job

1575
01:17:21,791 --> 01:17:27,935
Until they can replicate the stuff

1576
01:17:28,191 --> 01:17:34,079
I believe

1577
01:17:34,335 --> 01:17:34,847
If you think

1578
01:17:35,103 --> 01:17:38,175
It does lead me to believe that doctor Whittaker isn't

1579
01:17:38,431 --> 01:17:44,063
Even aware of the studies about testicular cancer

1580
01:17:44,319 --> 01:17:45,343
Makes me a little

1581
01:17:45,599 --> 01:17:51,743
Concerned what makes me more concerned

1582
01:17:51,999 --> 01:17:53,279
Galaxy

1583
01:17:55,327 --> 01:17:56,607
Getting defensive and trying to

1584
01:17:56,863 --> 01:17:59,423
To backup Dr Whitaker because he has the

1585
01:18:00,447 --> 01:18:03,007
The anti-vaccine arguments that Alex loves and that's

1586
01:18:03,519 --> 01:18:08,895
10000 copies of his books

1587
01:18:09,151 --> 01:18:11,455
So when you have when you have this like

1588
01:18:11,711 --> 01:18:12,735
It's clear that

1589
01:18:12,991 --> 01:18:14,271
Most of the world

1590
01:18:14,783 --> 01:18:15,295
Act

1591
01:18:15,807 --> 01:18:16,831
You believe why

1592
01:18:18,623 --> 01:18:22,463
The sources that you can get to back up why are people like him

1593
01:18:22,975 --> 01:18:28,863
I'm like that lady dr. Rebecca Carly who got her license taken away

1594
01:18:29,119 --> 01:18:31,423
If those are the only people you got

1595
01:18:31,679 --> 01:18:33,983
To backup your worlds

1596
01:18:34,239 --> 01:18:36,031
Trouble you got a really bad world

1597
01:18:36,287 --> 01:18:37,823
Because if the bike

1598
01:18:38,079 --> 01:18:38,847
Legitimate

1599
01:18:39,103 --> 01:18:39,871
Respectable science

1600
01:18:40,895 --> 01:18:41,919
Did not believe

1601
01:18:42,175 --> 01:18:42,943
Mainstream science

1602
01:18:43,711 --> 01:18:45,247
And they believe the things that Alex

1603
01:18:46,271 --> 01:18:47,295
He would not be hard to get

1604
01:18:47,807 --> 01:18:49,343
People who knew what they were talking about

1605
01:18:49,599 --> 01:18:50,623
To come on your show

1606
01:18:52,415 --> 01:18:53,695
About it it would be hard

1607
01:18:53,951 --> 01:18:54,719
Exactly

1608
01:18:55,231 --> 01:18:55,999
Do people like this

1609
01:18:56,511 --> 01:19:00,607
Is it just means that it means the pool is shallow

1610
01:19:00,863 --> 01:19:03,935
It's one of those big big differences between

1611
01:19:04,191 --> 01:19:04,959
People who

1612
01:19:05,471 --> 01:19:08,799
No things and study things and all that s*** versus bees guys

1613
01:19:09,055 --> 01:19:10,079
Is as you were saying

1614
01:19:10,335 --> 01:19:14,431
Whatever this actual oncologist

1615
01:19:16,223 --> 01:19:22,367
Goes on the show he's very reasonable yes we have seen that holistic

1616
01:19:22,623 --> 01:19:23,647
Coaches can benefits of

1617
01:19:23,903 --> 01:19:30,047
However

1618
01:19:30,303 --> 01:19:36,447
Credible study about it

1619
01:19:39,263 --> 01:19:43,615
Hahaha Italy makes

1620
01:19:43,871 --> 01:19:45,919
Look at this arrogant

1621
01:19:46,175 --> 01:19:50,527
That felt great

1622
01:19:50,783 --> 01:19:53,343
Send their Ivory Towers with their studies

1623
01:19:53,599 --> 01:19:57,951
Not all of us got to go to college you got a

1624
01:19:58,207 --> 01:20:02,303
You got a delay but right don't just put that out there

1625
01:20:02,559 --> 01:20:03,071
From Berkeley

1626
01:20:03,839 --> 01:20:09,215
Pacific engineering and that might be true I don't know

1627
01:20:09,471 --> 01:20:13,567
Berkeley and civic engineering and then all the sudden decide to be a naturopath

1628
01:20:13,824 --> 01:20:18,432
From his telling of the story he ended up meeting a Native American

1629
01:20:21,504 --> 01:20:27,648
Are Tampa land of course I wore a black man it was

1630
01:20:27,904 --> 01:20:33,024
Get into this is part of his backstory

1631
01:20:33,280 --> 01:20:35,072
It's kind of comical but at the same time

1632
01:20:35,584 --> 01:20:36,096
There's a chance

1633
01:20:36,352 --> 01:20:37,376
He did go to Berkeley

1634
01:20:37,632 --> 01:20:38,144
What is a Chauncey

1635
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:42,240
He did me some Native American guy who got him off on his weird batural hellpath

1636
01:20:42,496 --> 01:20:45,312
I don't know

1637
01:20:45,568 --> 01:20:46,592
I'm not going to try and

1638
01:20:46,848 --> 01:20:48,128
Stuff's out his college

1639
01:20:48,384 --> 01:20:49,664
Transcript for anything

1640
01:20:50,176 --> 01:20:56,320
And only talk about the stuff that I can sort of talk about a man who create

1641
01:20:56,576 --> 01:21:02,720
University of his own fake degree then having a back story involving

1642
01:21:05,536 --> 01:21:09,888
Not the way I'm going to go with us

1643
01:21:10,144 --> 01:21:11,936
Music instruments

1644
01:21:12,448 --> 01:21:12,960
Scholar

1645
01:21:14,240 --> 01:21:15,008
So who knows

1646
01:21:15,520 --> 01:21:16,544
Anyway

1647
01:21:17,312 --> 01:21:18,592
Here Alex

1648
01:21:19,104 --> 01:21:19,872
Dr. Whitaker

1649
01:21:20,128 --> 01:21:20,640
Post game

1650
01:21:20,896 --> 01:21:23,200
After they have ended the call with the

1651
01:21:23,456 --> 01:21:23,968
Oncologist

1652
01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:26,016
Kicked out oncologist

1653
01:21:37,280 --> 01:21:39,072
Well you know just the fact that he was

1654
01:21:44,192 --> 01:21:44,960
Carries on with heater

1655
01:21:46,752 --> 01:21:47,264
What's up

1656
01:21:47,776 --> 01:21:51,104
In a bottle

1657
01:21:53,408 --> 01:21:56,480
Go to school

1658
01:21:56,736 --> 01:21:57,504
And I don't believe it

1659
01:21:58,016 --> 01:22:00,320
Yes 50 science

1660
01:22:03,648 --> 01:22:05,952
That is a raving lunatic

1661
01:22:07,488 --> 01:22:09,536
Is condemning the very idea of the

1662
01:22:11,072 --> 01:22:12,608
Like repeatability of sodomy

1663
01:22:12,864 --> 01:22:14,400
Confirmability

1664
01:22:14,656 --> 01:22:17,984
Excluding extraneous variables that sort of thing

1665
01:22:18,240 --> 01:22:20,800
He's like they are so trapped

1666
01:22:21,056 --> 01:22:21,568
Denair

1667
01:22:21,824 --> 01:22:22,592
Scientific I

1668
01:22:22,848 --> 01:22:23,360
Ideas like

1669
01:22:24,384 --> 01:22:24,896
Yeah man

1670
01:22:25,408 --> 01:22:26,944
Good

1671
01:22:30,528 --> 01:22:32,064
Go to these colleges

1672
01:22:32,320 --> 01:22:34,368
And if you don't think a certain way

1673
01:22:34,624 --> 01:22:36,928
You know like with facts or whatever it is they called

1674
01:22:42,048 --> 01:22:45,632
You have a delay button

1675
01:22:45,888 --> 01:22:48,704
This is really just f***** up I mean it

1676
01:22:48,960 --> 01:22:49,728
Somebody really f***** up

1677
01:22:50,240 --> 01:22:52,032
Everything in terms of Alex's Medical

1678
01:22:53,056 --> 01:22:55,360
Yeah we have like that that interview with Rebecca Carl

1679
01:22:58,688 --> 01:22:59,968
Bow

1680
01:23:00,224 --> 01:23:02,272
I'm talking about that don't get back to me

1681
01:23:03,296 --> 01:23:04,576
This guy coming in

1682
01:23:05,088 --> 01:23:05,600
Expressing Lake

1683
01:23:05,856 --> 01:23:06,368
All medicine

1684
01:23:06,624 --> 01:23:07,392
I'm just wants to kill you

1685
01:23:07,648 --> 01:23:08,160
Brighton

1686
01:23:09,952 --> 01:23:10,464
I mean it

1687
01:23:10,720 --> 01:23:11,488
Kind of old hat

1688
01:23:11,744 --> 01:23:13,792
Interesting new character

1689
01:23:14,048 --> 01:23:15,072
A couple of flourishes

1690
01:23:16,352 --> 01:23:17,632
I just hate that

1691
01:23:17,888 --> 01:23:19,936
I hate these people so much

1692
01:23:20,960 --> 01:23:22,240
There

1693
01:23:22,496 --> 01:23:23,776
Sweet and utter

1694
01:23:24,800 --> 01:23:25,312
Like

1695
01:23:25,824 --> 01:23:27,616
They are not hurting themselves

1696
01:23:27,872 --> 01:23:29,152
Because it's very

1697
01:23:36,064 --> 01:23:37,600
They're hurting other people

1698
01:23:37,856 --> 01:23:39,904
The end of this adventure

1699
01:23:40,160 --> 01:23:41,440
BECU

1700
01:23:41,952 --> 01:23:42,720
Interesting

1701
01:23:42,976 --> 01:23:43,488
Prospect

1702
01:23:44,768 --> 01:23:45,280
Alex's

1703
01:23:45,792 --> 01:23:46,304
Is rhetoric

1704
01:23:46,816 --> 01:23:47,840
Sliding towards

1705
01:23:48,352 --> 01:23:49,120
Antigua

1706
01:23:49,376 --> 01:23:49,888
I'm back

1707
01:23:51,168 --> 01:23:51,680
Involving

1708
01:23:53,216 --> 01:23:53,728
Weird

1709
01:23:53,984 --> 01:23:54,496
Constellation

1710
01:23:54,752 --> 01:23:56,544
Things starting to happen

1711
01:23:57,056 --> 01:23:57,568
Ready to roll

1712
01:23:57,824 --> 01:23:59,360
It feels like it's starting to roll

1713
01:23:59,872 --> 01:24:01,408
Now that makes it worthwhile.

1714
01:24:01,664 --> 01:24:02,688
That we spent so much time

1715
