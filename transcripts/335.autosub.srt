00:01:13,216 --> 00:01:18,592

You bless somebody else

11
00:01:32,928 --> 00:01:35,488
Poker tournament that we were throwing for a friend of ours

12
00:01:40,096 --> 00:01:42,656
To give him the money

13
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:43,680
We didn't we knew that

14
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:44,960

00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:45,728

18
00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:07,232
Really bad about it

19
00:02:07,488 --> 00:02:08,256
Cuz I you wouldn't

20
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:11,072
Accept the money

21
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:13,632
And so what I did is I threw one of my trademark party

22
00:02:14,144 --> 00:02:16,192
Afterwards I don't know where I pick this up

23
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:16,960
What might have been

24
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:17,984

But everybody comes to the party gets there

00:02:35,648 --> 00:02:39,488
That was a great time

31
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:42,816
Kick somebody out of the party's over because they were trying to

00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:48,448

Mice answer back

86
00:05:55,327 --> 00:05:57,631
So how many plays does it take before we get a

87
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:02,751
I don't I don't I don't forget we ever will be

88
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:03,775
And that's okay

89
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:08,895
So Jordan today we're going to be going over the span of March 5th

90
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:10,431
March 5th

91
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:12,479
Teeth to March 22nd

92
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:15,551
2013

93
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:16,319
Yeah

94
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:18,367
And the reason

95
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:20,671
That long

96
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:22,975
Is that so

97
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:24,767
You were on vacation

98
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:26,047
Coroplast

99
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:29,375
And I decided that I'm one of the things

100
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:32,447
I get through a lot of it

101
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:37,567
A little bit little bit

102
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:43,967
There is a little bit of

103
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:44,991
Restart

104
00:06:45,247 --> 00:06:47,551
Doing this the crisis actors stop

105
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:48,831
And we are just like

106
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:49,855
Wow Alex

107
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:51,135
Just

108
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:53,439
Piers Morgan s***

109
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:54,719
He is all over the place

110
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:58,815
And it's not like you can just skip ahead I mean you literally have to listen to the episode

111
00:06:59,071 --> 00:06:59,839
Before you can figure out

112
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:02,399
You know you can't just not

113
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:03,679
Into an episode

114
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:07,007
One of the frustrations

115
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:11,615
If you don't listen to all of them that you don't really understand that

116
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:13,919
Development what's behind

117
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:15,199
The rhetoric which is

118
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:16,735
What I'm most interest

119
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:21,599
So we going over this stretch of a little bit about a week

120
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:23,135
Of Alex's show

121
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:24,159
And I think

122
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:25,695
We might have some big

123
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:28,255
So it's good that we went ahead

124
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:31,583
I'm also I should say

125
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:34,655
That during this time there's something that I've just I don't have it

126
00:07:35,679 --> 00:07:36,959
But it does bear make

127
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:39,263
Because Alex

128
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:40,799
About it

129
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:43,103
Abmat is the 2013

130
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:45,151
Cypriot financial crisis

131
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:47,455
Okay coming to a head

132
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:49,247
So the banks in Cyprus

133
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:50,783
Are going through some trouble

134
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:53,599
And I was thinking about it like well I'm not

135
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:54,367
The best

136
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:56,415
International finance

137
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:01,791
It would take a whole lot of time and it'll be like

138
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:02,559
40 minutes

139
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:03,327
This podcast

140
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:04,351
Explain

141
00:08:04,607 --> 00:08:06,399
How much of the debt was

142
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:07,423
Bad Greek

143
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:12,799
Haven status

144
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:14,079
Cypress

145
00:08:14,335 --> 00:08:17,407
I mean they put out a good album but after that they really

146
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:18,175
Kind of mismanaged

147
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:18,943
Is there money

148
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:24,831
What am I thinking

149
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:28,415
I don't know what you're thinking

150
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:31,487
I was hoping you would jump there joke

151
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:33,791
I didn't want to do it in the membrane

152
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:38,143
So I just decided that

153
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:42,239
Alex's take on it is very standard for anytime

154
00:08:42,495 --> 00:08:43,263
There's some sort of

155
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:44,031
The money thing

156
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:47,359
And that is the globalists are doing it is and they're trying to cause

157
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:52,479
As opposed to

158
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:56,575
Some of the lingering effects from the 2008/2009

159
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:57,599
Situations

160
00:08:58,367 --> 00:09:00,159
I just decided that

161
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:03,487
In and of itself is an important Global of

162
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:05,535
But for what

163
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:07,583
Texas doing it's not that important

164
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:09,375
Except for a couple of ways

165
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:10,911
That it extends

166
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:11,935
Two other area

167
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:13,727
And I will talk about those

168
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:16,799
But I don't I just we don't have the time

169
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:18,079
Breakdown

170
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:20,639
This.

171
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:21,919
I appreciate that

172
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:25,503
From Today Show before we jump

173
00:09:33,695 --> 00:09:38,559
Roccat about the Battle

174
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:44,959
How old is Imagine Alex in a fedora

175
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:48,543
Blues Man Hank

176
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:50,079
The devil that's boring

177
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:52,383
Let's go all the way with scat

178
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:58,015
Start on the 15th

179
00:09:58,271 --> 00:10:01,855
And what we find here on this episode is Alex

180
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:02,879
Is

181
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:05,951
Just continuing his insistence

182
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:09,279
That basically we need to go kill Kim Jeong Hoon

183
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:10,047
Okay

184
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:11,839
Alright

185
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:19,775
Running around

186
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:22,335
Surrounded by

187
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:37,183
But when you are openly running around

188
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:40,767
North Korea

189
00:10:58,175 --> 00:11:00,223
Good

190
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:05,087
That's a good Line in the Sand

191
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:05,855
2

192
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:08,927
Someone's house with a gun and saying you're going to shoot them

193
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:11,999
Issue no

194
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:17,119
There's a brain

195
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:24,031
I don't think North Korea is withheld by First Amendment of the US Constitution

196
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:27,103
I'm just I'm just going to say that

197
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:33,247
Only inasmuch as like Alex is on like a pretty militant Pat

198
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:34,271
Relate

199
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:35,039
North Korea

200
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:36,831
Pinterest

201
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:39,135
And the second piece of it is just a

202
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:40,159
The tacit understanding

203
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:41,183
Things that even though free

204
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:43,743
Free speech is protected in the United States

205
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:45,279
There are limitations

206
00:11:46,303 --> 00:11:47,071
Which is important

207
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:49,375
Because I was pretending years later

208
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:52,959
6 minutes later

209
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:55,519
6 minutes

210
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:58,079
You know even back in 2013 as a lot of apps

211
00:11:58,335 --> 00:11:59,359
Absolutist ideas about

212
00:11:59,615 --> 00:12:00,383
Bedford

213
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:01,919
Incongruity

214
00:12:02,175 --> 00:12:03,711
With what he understands to ask

215
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:05,247
What free speech

216
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:08,575
Pictures about now Kim jong-un's surround himself with

217
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:09,599
With people who are drunk

218
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:10,367
On the

219
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:11,135
The blood

220
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:18,047
Might be more literal than you think

221
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:18,815
Is adrenochrome

222
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:20,863
You might actually be

223
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:24,959
You talkin about them being vampires from contact

224
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:28,031
If you think they force their fellow compatriots

225
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:28,799
Get drunk

226
00:12:29,055 --> 00:12:29,567
Prior to

227
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:30,591
Making their blood

228
00:12:30,847 --> 00:12:34,943
So they would have a hyphen

229
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:39,039
Alcohol blood

230
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:40,319
You'd probably get lice

231
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:41,599
You think so

232
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:45,439
Well well I mean just based on how much

233
00:12:45,695 --> 00:12:51,839
Alcohol there is in blood than in alcohol

234
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:54,655
Let's just a cocktail

235
00:12:57,727 --> 00:13:01,055
You've just invented at the worst Bloody Mary

236
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:02,591
Alright

237
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:04,895
Okay

238
00:13:08,223 --> 00:13:08,991
Kim Jeong Hoon

239
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:09,759
A bit

240
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:11,551
He's getting like the violence

241
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:16,415
He's talking about the people

242
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:17,439
To talk about his

243
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:37,919
I mean that's just to further evidence that he probably

244
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:40,223
Sometimes

245
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:40,991
REI

246
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:42,527
I think it was describing

247
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:44,831
That is

248
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:46,111
Getting help for

249
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:48,415
Like if anybody

250
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:54,559
But like when I get aggressive I turn into a caveman I can't help myself

251
00:13:57,887 --> 00:14:00,191
Tenable way to existence

252
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:03,007
If you are if you are like

253
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:06,079
Completely controlled by the whims of violence

254
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:08,639
You're you're messed up man

255
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:09,919
Know if at any point

256
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:11,711
Time you have no higher order

257
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:13,503
He's describing

258
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:14,271
If you are simply

259
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:15,807
Overtaken by

260
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:18,623
Testosterone

261
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:19,391
Society

262
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:25,279
Somebody who would walk up to your door and have a gun in their hand

263
00:14:26,303 --> 00:14:26,815
Helped out

264
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:29,375
Violence

265
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:33,471
Sort of Albert's bragging about his own violent end

266
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:36,799
Ranting about

267
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:37,823
Demons

268
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:39,359
Dianne Feinstein

269
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:41,151
FaceTime

270
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:43,711
Continue of it

271
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:44,991
Insult

272
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:46,015
Half an hour

273
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:47,039
Of just like

274
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:48,063
Rambo

275
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:48,831
About nothing

276
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:51,135
Nothing going

277
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:52,927
Talent if it true tell

278
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:56,255
Sing about this other thing

279
00:14:56,511 --> 00:14:57,023
That has been

280
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:58,303
Developing and that is

281
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:00,863
People particularly Michael Moore

282
00:15:03,423 --> 00:15:03,935
That want the

283
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:04,703
Pictures

284
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:05,983
From Sandy Hook

285
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:06,751
To be released

286
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:09,055
Because there are times people were saying

287
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:10,847
And the

288
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:13,407
Motivation behind the

289
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:14,431
Desire to release the picture

290
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:16,991
Seeing photos is

291
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:18,015
Cut that off

292
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:20,831
The

293
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:23,647
Fake

294
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:47,967
Should I go your calls

295
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:49,247
Nope

296
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:54,623
So that is what he believes he want to show pictures cuz they love it

297
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:55,391
Right

298
00:15:55,647 --> 00:15:56,159
Which is a

299
00:15:56,927 --> 00:15:57,439
Thrill gross

300
00:15:58,719 --> 00:15:59,743
They want to show the pic

301
00:16:00,767 --> 00:16:01,279
Cuz they love

302
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:03,071
And glorify the death

303
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:05,631
Yes but they also want to use that

304
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:07,167
Trick you

305
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:08,191
To letting them

306
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:11,007
Break which will inevitably lead

307
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:15,103
To a tyranny

308
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:19,199
The time

309
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:21,247
But there's so many mass shooting

310
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:23,551
It's not like they're running

311
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:25,343
Okay

312
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:28,159
Sort of thinking

313
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:28,927
Extenze

314
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:31,231
Where Alex

315
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:33,023
Discussing an instant

316
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:34,815
When gun campus

317
00:16:35,071 --> 00:16:36,095
The station LEDs

318
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:36,863
The genocide

319
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:43,007
Okay 100% historically accurate

320
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:08,351
So

321
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:11,679
One quick but in Port

322
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:12,447
Points

323
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:16,287
The vast majority of both the Hutu and Tutsi Rwanda or Christian

324
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:20,639
There were religious figures who fought against the knot

325
00:17:22,687 --> 00:17:25,759
Is it the Tutsi were Christians and Hutu were not is a complete lie

326
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:27,551
That is absolute nonsense

327
00:17:28,831 --> 00:17:29,343
He's just talkin

328
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:30,879
Try and create

329
00:17:31,135 --> 00:17:32,927
Some sort of a white Hood narrative

330
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:35,743
Christian victimhood which is

331
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:41,375
It is interesting that you can turn a

332
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:43,167
Genocide in Africa

333
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:44,191
Between

334
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:45,215
Two tribes

335
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:46,751
Black people in

336
00:17:47,007 --> 00:17:48,799
28

337
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:50,079
I guess that

338
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:51,359
So big a piece

339
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:53,151
This is his s*** that's why my brain

340
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:56,223
Did that little cup

341
00:17:56,479 --> 00:17:58,783
Identify with are actually the victim

342
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:02,367
Personalization

343
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:03,903
In the wrong way

344
00:18:04,671 --> 00:18:07,743
Unfolded in Rwanda in the early 90s

345
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:09,279
Complicated

346
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:13,631
There's no one factor that led to the genocide

347
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:16,447
The answer of what we is a global Community could have done

348
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:17,215
Stop it

349
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:22,079
Answer either of these questions involves a lot of possibilities a lot of missed opportunities

350
00:18:22,335 --> 00:18:22,847
Deescalate

351
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:23,615
The situation

352
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:25,151
To recognize the warnings

353
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:28,479
And ultimately when you look back you see pretty much nothing

354
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:29,247
Tragedy

355
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:34,623
I know that Alex's solution to everything literally is just everyone should have a gun

356
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:37,183
But honestly if you look seriously at the Dynamics at work

357
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:40,767
Implayer in Rwanda that's just a childish delusion

358
00:18:42,047 --> 00:18:44,863
Even if every Tootsie had a gun it probably wouldn't have been able to

359
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:45,631
Stop the horror

360
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:46,655
Transpired

361
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:50,495
What are the most indelible images of the Rwandan Genocide is out of

362
00:18:50,751 --> 00:18:51,263
Machete

363
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:53,567
The Hutu militia

364
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:56,895
Used machetes as their primary weapon because guns were to occur

365
00:18:57,151 --> 00:18:58,431
Expensive for what they had planned

366
00:18:59,199 --> 00:19:01,247
Where is bullets

367
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:02,015
Or not

368
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:06,879
There's a reason that there's no reason to assume that the victims of their violence were any more able to

369
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:08,415
Report a gun whether or not

370
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:09,183
They had access

371
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:15,327
An important consideration is that

372
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:19,167
It becomes kind of a dishonest framing today that they weren't allowed to own

373
00:19:19,423 --> 00:19:19,935
Gun

374
00:19:21,983 --> 00:19:22,495
Chair

375
00:19:22,751 --> 00:19:24,287
But I wanted to get to the bottom of this

376
00:19:24,543 --> 00:19:26,591
I want to understand where the idea that

377
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:29,151
Tootsie's had their guns before they were last

378
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:31,711
I wanted to sort this out because

379
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:34,527
Materials I've ever read about the Rwandan genocide

380
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:39,135
And get it comes up for these gun weirdo

381
00:19:39,903 --> 00:19:42,207
They are implying going to happen before

382
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:43,743
Broke out

383
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:48,351
The confiscation of property that happened during

384
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:49,887
Caskers

385
00:19:50,143 --> 00:19:50,911
Campaign

386
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:52,191
Isn't there talk

387
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:52,959
In about

388
00:19:57,311 --> 00:19:59,103
They all of the claims online

389
00:19:59,359 --> 00:19:59,871
Trace back to

390
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:00,895
On all of these

391
00:20:01,151 --> 00:20:01,663
Strange

392
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:02,431
Or they can

393
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:03,199
Constructed blog

394
00:20:04,223 --> 00:20:07,551
The first is reference is made to the Nairobi protocol for the prevention

395
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:10,111
Control and reduction of small arms and light weapons

396
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:11,391
The Great Lakes region

397
00:20:11,647 --> 00:20:12,159
The Horn of Africa

398
00:20:13,183 --> 00:20:16,255
This absolutely was a resolution that's not to limit civilian ownership

399
00:20:16,511 --> 00:20:17,791
Gun

400
00:20:18,047 --> 00:20:21,375
Each participating country decided was illegal civilian owner

401
00:20:21,887 --> 00:20:22,399
Guns

402
00:20:22,911 --> 00:20:24,447
I have to suspect this is what Alex's

403
00:20:24,703 --> 00:20:25,215
Is referring to

404
00:20:25,471 --> 00:20:28,799
Since he's talking about that clip which is definitely involved in

405
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:30,079
The Nairobi protocol

406
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:36,991
Teen aerobic protocol was largely targeted at the illicit trade of weapons internationally in the language is pretty clear

407
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:37,759
Got that

408
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:38,527
It does

409
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:40,831
Contains language about confiscating illegal weapons

410
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:44,415
Registering authorized firearm so I can understand why Gunn weirdos

411
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:45,695
Be pretty upset about that

412
00:20:46,719 --> 00:20:47,743
The problem though

413
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:51,583
Is that when they try and Link this with the genocide in Rwanda

414
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:52,863
What is a big problem

415
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:56,447
Since the Nairobi protocol was signed in April 2004

416
00:20:57,471 --> 00:20:58,239
Is actor

417
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:00,543
That doesn't sound right

418
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:05,407
I've seen folks try to link this to sit

419
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:06,175
Full gear

420
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:08,223
Before that sun I really protocol to sign

421
00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:09,503
This piece of evidence

422
00:21:09,759 --> 00:21:11,551
It's just doesn't check out

423
00:21:12,831 --> 00:21:17,184
What was it posted by a white guy

424
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:17,952
6960

425
00:21:18,464 --> 00:21:19,232
Might as well

426
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:22,048
More concrete

427
00:21:23,584 --> 00:21:24,096
Discuss online

428
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:25,120
Like the NRA is what

429
00:21:26,144 --> 00:21:26,656
Knock knock

430
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:29,472
Not specifically saying that this cause

431
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:35,872
Either of the campaign

432
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:37,408
Yeah based on

433
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:38,176
Chronology

434
00:21:38,432 --> 00:21:38,944
Bright

435
00:21:39,456 --> 00:21:43,040
The second piece of evidence I can find is a mini documentary called

436
00:21:43,296 --> 00:21:44,064
Betrayed

437
00:21:44,576 --> 00:21:47,392
Which makes the argument basically that all genocide

438
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:48,672
Seated by Gunn

439
00:21:48,928 --> 00:21:49,440
Control measures

440
00:21:49,696 --> 00:21:53,792
Effectively saying that if you're for gun-control you knowingly or unknowingly are going

441
00:21:54,048 --> 00:21:54,560
To cause agenus

442
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,120
If a documentary there's a section

443
00:21:57,376 --> 00:21:59,680
About Rwanda

444
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:00,448
Lawson

445
00:22:00,704 --> 00:22:01,984
Poverty of kept the victims

446
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,008
From getting weapons to the

447
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:07,104
As they're saying there's an image flash is on the screen

448
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,896
All the fences and

449
00:22:09,152 --> 00:22:10,688
Concealable arms are prohibited

450
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:11,712
With the words

451
00:22:11,968 --> 00:22:12,736
Are prohibited

452
00:22:12,992 --> 00:22:13,760
Outside the

453
00:22:14,016 --> 00:22:15,552
Quotation mark

454
00:22:15,808 --> 00:22:18,624
I'm not

455
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:19,392
Sure

456
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:21,440
What that mean

457
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:23,232
Yeah yeah yeah

458
00:22:23,488 --> 00:22:25,280
I don't know where this is coming from

459
00:22:25,536 --> 00:22:28,864
Right and there's absolutely no indication of what it's sighting

460
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:33,728
In the film there's no attribution

461
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:34,752
That's fine

462
00:22:35,008 --> 00:22:36,032
Flashes up on the screen

463
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:40,384
Well it was a weird choice. To have that is a thing

464
00:22:40,896 --> 00:22:43,712
It is innocence what is it in Central Asia

465
00:22:43,968 --> 00:22:50,112
Betrayed betrayed man

466
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:52,416
From Ron Paul and Ted Nugent

467
00:22:53,184 --> 00:22:53,696
So cool

468
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:55,232
Great

469
00:22:55,488 --> 00:22:58,816
Good work so those words are flashed over an image that

470
00:22:59,072 --> 00:23:01,376
Seems to be presenting itself as a legal

471
00:23:01,888 --> 00:23:04,192
What the heck

472
00:23:04,704 --> 00:23:07,520
Which is the name of a major newspaper in Rwanda

473
00:23:07,776 --> 00:23:10,080
The official Gazette of the Republic of Rwanda

474
00:23:10,592 --> 00:23:13,152
However the name of it is actually eat

475
00:23:13,664 --> 00:23:15,200
Which makes me a little bit

476
00:23:15,456 --> 00:23:16,224
Suspicious of the graphic

477
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,016
Save a misspelled name of the

478
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:18,784
Because that tea

479
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,320
Every time we talk about the

480
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,136
There are always those little things

481
00:23:23,904 --> 00:23:24,672
If you

482
00:23:24,928 --> 00:23:25,696
Had a good point

483
00:23:26,464 --> 00:23:27,232
You would have spent

484
00:23:30,048 --> 00:23:31,584
Presented like you weren't happy

485
00:23:32,352 --> 00:23:36,448
I stay away with this project

486
00:23:36,704 --> 00:23:38,496
Alex Jones City documentary

487
00:23:38,752 --> 00:23:39,776
Because people are going to believe it in

488
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:41,056
Know

489
00:23:41,312 --> 00:23:45,152
Superimposed

490
00:23:47,712 --> 00:23:49,760
I put over a picture of a noose

491
00:23:50,272 --> 00:23:50,784
That is

492
00:23:51,808 --> 00:23:52,576
Reference correct

493
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:53,856
Probably

494
00:23:54,112 --> 00:23:56,928
Superimposed over this image of these pose legislation

495
00:23:57,184 --> 00:23:58,976
Just the words article 50

496
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:05,376
Which is Manchester just I believe that this quote is from Article 15 presumably from the Rwandan

497
00:24:05,888 --> 00:24:06,400
Petition

498
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:09,216
Rwanda Constitution is nothing

499
00:24:09,728 --> 00:24:11,520
With guns it's about people having equality

500
00:24:11,776 --> 00:24:12,288
Under the eyes

501
00:24:12,544 --> 00:24:14,080
Velox

502
00:24:14,336 --> 00:24:14,848
Think of that

503
00:24:16,128 --> 00:24:16,640
The current cons

504
00:24:16,896 --> 00:24:18,944
Duchenne of Rwanda was put in place in 2000

505
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:19,712
Free

506
00:24:19,968 --> 00:24:22,528
So maybe Article 15 of the previous Constitution

507
00:24:22,784 --> 00:24:23,296
Was about Gunn

508
00:24:24,064 --> 00:24:24,576
Nope

509
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:30,464
Their 1991 Constitution did include an Article 15

510
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:31,744
Recognized within the conditions

511
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:32,768
Define by law

512
00:24:33,024 --> 00:24:35,584
Expedition Shelby authorized only within the limits

513
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:36,608
Prescribed by law

514
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:40,704
There's no version of Article 15 that exists in the Rwandan law that is anything

515
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,752
To do with the ban on quote offensive in

516
00:24:43,008 --> 00:24:43,520
Concealable AR

517
00:24:45,824 --> 00:24:46,592
The 15th

518
00:24:46,848 --> 00:24:47,360
Article

519
00:24:47,616 --> 00:24:48,384
Of the paper

520
00:24:48,896 --> 00:24:49,408
That day

521
00:24:49,664 --> 00:24:52,736
Article 15

522
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:56,064
Article

523
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:05,024
Score of the headline heading of a Rwandan newspaper being used as an image

524
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:05,792
Over witches

525
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:08,608
Quote about Rwanda gun laws is being presented

526
00:25:08,864 --> 00:25:09,632
Restrict

527
00:25:09,888 --> 00:25:10,400
New gun laws

528
00:25:10,656 --> 00:25:11,936
Preceded the outbreak of the genocide

529
00:25:12,448 --> 00:25:15,008
With a cryptic reference to an Article 15 which doesn't

530
00:25:16,544 --> 00:25:20,640
From everything I can tell this is a complete fabrication antibiotic it seems like a disgusting

531
00:25:20,896 --> 00:25:21,920
Appropriation of one of the most

532
00:25:22,176 --> 00:25:23,712
Horrific chapters in modern day

533
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,760
Text to serve as a prop

534
00:25:26,272 --> 00:25:26,784
For this gun

535
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:27,552
Carnage

536
00:25:28,576 --> 00:25:29,088
That's so good

537
00:25:31,136 --> 00:25:31,648
We rarely see p

538
00:25:35,744 --> 00:25:41,888
It shouldn't surprise you to learn that this film was created by Jews for the preservation of firearms ownership

539
00:25:42,144 --> 00:25:48,288
Alex Jones's earliest sponsors the oldest Snapchat

540
00:25:48,544 --> 00:25:49,824
Being from May 19th

541
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:52,384
9 has a link to their website

542
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,176
Alexander Jews for the preservation

543
00:25:54,432 --> 00:25:55,712
In the Firearms ownership go

544
00:25:55,968 --> 00:25:56,480
Wayback

545
00:25:57,504 --> 00:25:58,016
Organization

546
00:25:58,272 --> 00:26:00,576
Started by a big old gun weirdo named Aaron

547
00:26:00,832 --> 00:26:04,672
Zelman has been exercising absolute extremism my behalf

548
00:26:04,928 --> 00:26:05,952
Since 1989

549
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:11,840
Interesting Lee with very little time on Google I found both Larry Pratt

550
00:26:12,096 --> 00:26:15,936
Associating themselves with Salman and his group as a rebuttal to accusation

551
00:26:16,192 --> 00:26:17,216
Consult their anti-semite

552
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,800
For Pratt it was when he was fired from the 1990s

553
00:26:21,312 --> 00:26:24,128
Pat Buchanan campaign

554
00:26:24,384 --> 00:26:24,896
The neo-nazis

555
00:26:25,408 --> 00:26:27,200
It was at the Rocky Mountain rendezvous

556
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:30,272
For Ted Nugent it was after he got in trouble for posting

557
00:26:30,528 --> 00:26:33,856
An image on Facebook behind Gunn

558
00:26:34,112 --> 00:26:40,256
Control with pictures of Dianne Feinstein Chuck Schumer and 10 others opposed gun-grabbers Israeli flag

559
00:26:40,512 --> 00:26:41,024
Eggs on their face

560
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:45,120
We might as well have been reposting stuff from Stormfront

561
00:26:46,144 --> 00:26:49,216
Bananas that you can get away with

562
00:26:49,472 --> 00:26:51,264
So I'm friends with

563
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:53,824
I'm also friends with Jewish Nazis

564
00:26:56,384 --> 00:26:56,896
Juju bar

565
00:26:57,152 --> 00:27:02,784
Explanation

566
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:04,064
Is so laughable

567
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,344
This is ridiculous

568
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:13,024
In my Rush between songwriting jams and usable

569
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:17,888
Musical recording

570
00:27:18,144 --> 00:27:24,288
Images of people

571
00:27:24,544 --> 00:27:30,688
Brown balls

572
00:27:30,944 --> 00:27:36,832
I haven't had a hit you up

573
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,648
And everything after that I f******

574
00:27:39,904 --> 00:27:41,184
Phone in

575
00:27:42,208 --> 00:27:46,304
I should point out the 12 Israeli flags are kind of them

576
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:47,328
Point of that image

577
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,120
They're really hard to miss

578
00:27:49,632 --> 00:27:52,960
Also over the image of senator Frank Lautenberg there is

579
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:54,496
Text that says quote

580
00:27:54,752 --> 00:27:58,592
Gave Russian Jew immigrants your tax money

581
00:27:58,848 --> 00:28:00,384
Carryover

582
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,432
This image

583
00:28:02,688 --> 00:28:06,016
I think it would be totally get away with it

584
00:28:06,784 --> 00:28:09,344
I genuinely didn't know that was the Israeli flag

585
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:10,624
I'm Ted Nugent

586
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,160
I'm professionally amore

587
00:28:16,256 --> 00:28:20,352
So I definitely believe there are Jewish people who are opposed to Gunn

588
00:28:20,608 --> 00:28:24,960
Control measures wanted minimize

589
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:27,008
Existing

590
00:28:27,264 --> 00:28:28,032
Group

591
00:28:28,544 --> 00:28:30,592
Large portion of

592
00:28:30,848 --> 00:28:31,616
Membership with

593
00:28:31,872 --> 00:28:32,896
Even juice

594
00:28:33,152 --> 00:28:34,176
For the preservation of firearms

595
00:28:36,224 --> 00:28:37,248
Firearm

596
00:28:37,504 --> 00:28:38,784
Ownership

597
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:39,808
I believe that

598
00:28:41,088 --> 00:28:43,648
Vast number of people who are in that group are probably

599
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,696
Concerned citizens

600
00:28:46,208 --> 00:28:47,744
Jewish or otherwise

601
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:50,048
Who wrote just have

602
00:28:50,304 --> 00:28:53,120
Feelings about gun issue

603
00:28:57,472 --> 00:29:01,312
It seems like people like 10 and Larry have a relationship with them that feels

604
00:29:01,568 --> 00:29:02,080
Similar to

605
00:29:02,336 --> 00:29:03,616
Someone saying I can't be erased

606
00:29:03,872 --> 00:29:07,200
The organization

607
00:29:07,456 --> 00:29:09,504
To serve as a crutch to some of these

608
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:10,528
People who have

609
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:11,808
Connections with knots

610
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:13,344
In order to minimize

611
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:14,368
Distract from

612
00:29:15,392 --> 00:29:15,904
Those connection

613
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:18,720
Preservation of firearms ownership

614
00:29:18,976 --> 00:29:21,536
Who's responsible for Whole Lotta Vegas Oracle propaganda

615
00:29:21,792 --> 00:29:24,864
That goes around a Patriot Gun weirdo circles about gun laws

616
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:25,632
A consequence

617
00:29:26,144 --> 00:29:26,912
Of their enactment

618
00:29:27,424 --> 00:29:29,216
Apparently this stuff about Rolanda is Judge

619
00:29:29,984 --> 00:29:32,544
Yeah they have done a lot of pushing of the

620
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,592
The Hitler took the gun

621
00:29:34,848 --> 00:29:39,712
Before

622
00:29:39,968 --> 00:29:40,736
Should I which

623
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,832
Implore anyone to look into cuz that's

624
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,112
Ridiculous

625
00:29:50,208 --> 00:29:50,720
Is a little off

626
00:29:50,976 --> 00:29:51,488
On

627
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:56,096
Yeah f*** for a number of reasons

628
00:29:56,352 --> 00:29:58,400
That 22nd if we heard was

629
00:29:58,912 --> 00:29:59,936
Completely f***** up

630
00:30:00,704 --> 00:30:03,520
Call

631
00:30:03,776 --> 00:30:04,288
Coastal collar

632
00:30:05,056 --> 00:30:06,848
Illinois gun laws

633
00:30:07,616 --> 00:30:09,152
Alex is something that I find

634
00:30:09,408 --> 00:30:09,920
And troubling

635
00:30:11,456 --> 00:30:12,224
Last year

636
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,760
Bike mid-December

637
00:30:14,016 --> 00:30:16,064
The Supreme Court gave Illinois

638
00:30:16,832 --> 00:30:18,112
180 days

639
00:30:19,392 --> 00:30:20,416
With some sort of

640
00:30:20,672 --> 00:30:21,440
The right to carry

641
00:30:31,936 --> 00:30:32,960
Whoa

642
00:30:36,544 --> 00:30:37,056
So

643
00:30:37,312 --> 00:30:40,384
I find that troubling is that I think there's

644
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,152
Still a difference

645
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:42,432
Between

646
00:30:42,688 --> 00:30:43,968
Saying that it was staged

647
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:44,992
And saying

648
00:30:45,248 --> 00:30:46,272
That the globalist

649
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:48,576
REI

650
00:30:48,832 --> 00:30:49,856
Much closer

651
00:30:50,624 --> 00:30:51,392
EBay used actors

652
00:30:51,904 --> 00:30:53,696
Then saying they know they used

653
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:54,720
The Patsy

654
00:30:55,232 --> 00:30:56,512
Whatever

655
00:30:57,536 --> 00:30:58,048
It's not

656
00:30:58,560 --> 00:30:59,584
They're not saying that it was

657
00:31:00,096 --> 00:31:00,608
Directed

658
00:31:01,888 --> 00:31:02,400
The production is

659
00:31:03,424 --> 00:31:03,936
Made up

660
00:31:04,192 --> 00:31:05,472
It was all there too

661
00:31:05,728 --> 00:31:06,752
Play out in front of our eyes

662
00:31:07,264 --> 00:31:07,776
And none of it Act

663
00:31:08,544 --> 00:31:10,592
It's not as overt as I need to be

664
00:31:11,872 --> 00:31:12,640
Closer

665
00:31:12,896 --> 00:31:14,944
It's the language

666
00:31:15,968 --> 00:31:17,248
It appears to be heading

667
00:31:17,504 --> 00:31:18,016
Sing in that direction

668
00:31:18,272 --> 00:31:18,784
This is

669
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:21,088
Is it closer to the bad side of it

670
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:24,928
Terrible side

671
00:31:25,184 --> 00:31:25,952
Benny has been in

672
00:31:26,464 --> 00:31:27,744
I can understand

673
00:31:28,768 --> 00:31:29,536
Hyperbolic

674
00:31:29,792 --> 00:31:30,560
Metaphor

675
00:31:31,584 --> 00:31:32,096
But

676
00:31:32,352 --> 00:31:33,632
I mean when you say stage

677
00:31:34,144 --> 00:31:35,424
If you're going by what words

678
00:31:37,472 --> 00:31:39,264
And it also has to live in the context

679
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:40,544
Texas so many of the

680
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,080
Fringe online

681
00:31:42,336 --> 00:31:47,200
Theories that are already going around absolutely

682
00:31:47,456 --> 00:31:48,480
Like this was

683
00:31:48,992 --> 00:31:49,760
It's not like

684
00:31:50,016 --> 00:31:52,320
That is a 4in idea to a lot of

685
00:31:52,576 --> 00:31:53,856
Conspiracy weirdos right

686
00:31:54,368 --> 00:31:55,648
They will hear that

687
00:31:55,904 --> 00:31:57,440
I'm saying that these were

688
00:31:57,952 --> 00:31:58,976
Yeah

689
00:31:59,232 --> 00:32:01,280
And that we haven't really talked about it so much

690
00:32:02,048 --> 00:32:03,840
Chances are if you've been following along

691
00:32:04,096 --> 00:32:04,608
With the online

692
00:32:04,864 --> 00:32:07,936
And debate outside of his show the online debate

693
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:10,496
Debate the online fervor

694
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:13,312
Entirely fake

695
00:32:13,824 --> 00:32:14,336
Pretty quick

696
00:32:15,104 --> 00:32:17,920
So that he's coming back now and saying it

697
00:32:18,176 --> 00:32:18,688
Was staged

698
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,248
Most likely means he's relying on more current

699
00:32:22,784 --> 00:32:23,296
But you know

700
00:32:23,552 --> 00:32:24,832
It's in a Memphis

701
00:32:25,088 --> 00:32:26,624
It feels that way

702
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:33,792
Alex has an interview with the guy who got fired for the 1996

703
00:32:34,048 --> 00:32:37,120
Buchanan campaign because it came out today

704
00:32:37,376 --> 00:32:38,656
Larry Pratt

705
00:32:38,912 --> 00:32:41,472
And he wants to know if you want to talk about gun laws

706
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:45,568
I think he thinks he has a really good point here but I would say

707
00:32:45,824 --> 00:32:46,336
He doesn't

708
00:32:46,848 --> 00:32:48,640
Feinstein get a

709
00:32:48,896 --> 00:32:50,176
Wonderful,

710
00:32:58,880 --> 00:32:59,648
I've been

711
00:33:01,184 --> 00:33:03,488
First Amendment

712
00:33:11,168 --> 00:33:14,752
The invasion of privacy

713
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:26,016
Genius point is that like there are Shades there degrees that the Second Amendment

714
00:33:26,272 --> 00:33:28,832
Degrees of the first

715
00:33:29,088 --> 00:33:35,232
In the first clip of this episode Alex said there are

716
00:33:35,488 --> 00:33:38,048
Tons of books that have been bad US history

717
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:41,632
Cruising these right-wing morons could

718
00:33:42,144 --> 00:33:43,168
See

719
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:44,704
Egg the comeback

720
00:33:45,472 --> 00:33:50,848
Everything

721
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:54,688
You have to be a lunatic

722
00:33:54,944 --> 00:33:55,456
Take to be like

723
00:33:56,480 --> 00:34:02,624
What do you say that not everything is absolute your stupid is a good comeback free speech is protected by the

724
00:34:03,648 --> 00:34:04,416
But there's limits

725
00:34:05,696 --> 00:34:06,720
There's no reason

726
00:34:06,976 --> 00:34:07,488
To think

727
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:08,512
That

728
00:34:08,768 --> 00:34:10,560
Owning a firearm

729
00:34:10,816 --> 00:34:12,352
Is protected by the 2nd of May

730
00:34:12,864 --> 00:34:15,680
But there are limitations to owning a firearm

731
00:34:15,936 --> 00:34:18,240
There's no it's absolutely

732
00:34:18,752 --> 00:34:23,872
Lele and lied with every understanding of how societies work

733
00:34:24,128 --> 00:34:24,640
It's just

734
00:34:25,408 --> 00:34:25,920
Sociopath

735
00:34:26,176 --> 00:34:28,480
Works

736
00:34:29,248 --> 00:34:32,064
Joel skousen but

737
00:34:33,856 --> 00:34:36,928
Size very boring Alex just wanted to

738
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:38,464
Say that it's good

739
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:39,232
It's good idea

740
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:45,120
I hate

741
00:34:45,376 --> 00:34:47,168
Divorce but pretty

742
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:52,544
It seems like it's mostly a plug for Joel skousen book

743
00:34:55,872 --> 00:34:56,640
Strategic real okay

744
00:35:00,736 --> 00:35:01,504
Like nuclear war

745
00:35:02,528 --> 00:35:05,856
Me and that you need to know where that bug out to got to get scales

746
00:35:08,416 --> 00:35:10,208
So we get to the 17th

747
00:35:10,464 --> 00:35:10,976
Cuz

748
00:35:14,048 --> 00:35:14,816
The Sundays

749
00:35:15,584 --> 00:35:17,888
Big big narrative

750
00:35:18,144 --> 00:35:18,912
That Wilkin

751
00:35:19,168 --> 00:35:20,448
Continue throughout pretty-much

752
00:35:20,704 --> 00:35:21,472
The rest of our time

753
00:35:21,984 --> 00:35:25,568
I don't think I have a ton of clips of it but he brings it up over and over and over again

754
00:35:27,104 --> 00:35:28,128
Police station

755
00:35:28,384 --> 00:35:31,712
Oh there, what is it

756
00:35:31,968 --> 00:35:34,528
Prison list

757
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,576
Florida

758
00:35:52,192 --> 00:35:55,520
Law & Order balloons special balloon

759
00:35:56,032 --> 00:35:58,080
So there's an element of this case

760
00:35:58,336 --> 00:35:58,848
Spitaliks

761
00:36:01,152 --> 00:36:02,688
Intentionally leaving it out very

762
00:36:02,944 --> 00:36:03,712
Speculative

763
00:36:04,224 --> 00:36:10,368
If it's episode you just keeps going on and on about this guy was arrested because he released a bunch of balloons in a romantic gesture for his girlfriend

764
00:36:10,624 --> 00:36:13,696
Which is a crime in Florida because of Environmental Protection laws

765
00:36:14,208 --> 00:36:16,768
Apparently it turns out you can't release more than

766
00:36:17,024 --> 00:36:19,584
10 balloons in a 24-hour.

767
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:21,120
Which is admittedly a very

768
00:36:21,376 --> 00:36:21,888
Strange

769
00:36:22,144 --> 00:36:24,192
Limit your know it's very weird

770
00:36:24,704 --> 00:36:27,776
The story behind

771
00:36:28,032 --> 00:36:34,176
I didn't know story behind that large negotiation that

772
00:36:34,432 --> 00:36:35,712
What happened

773
00:36:35,968 --> 00:36:42,112
For what I don't know or if you have a group of people could eat if You released 10

774
00:36:42,624 --> 00:36:48,768
I don't I don't know the I have no idea

775
00:36:49,024 --> 00:36:52,096
Fourth Amendment says that I can only really so many balloons

776
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:53,632
Very weird

777
00:36:54,656 --> 00:36:56,448
The man in this case was Anthony breast

778
00:36:56,704 --> 00:37:01,568
3D prosecutors obviously didn't file a case

779
00:37:01,824 --> 00:37:02,336
Based on that

780
00:37:02,592 --> 00:37:04,384
It would have been literally impossible for them

781
00:37:04,896 --> 00:37:06,432
Proceed with that case and they knew it

782
00:37:06,688 --> 00:37:08,224
They didn't even pursue the case

783
00:37:08,736 --> 00:37:10,528
This is absolutely 100% And

784
00:37:11,296 --> 00:37:13,344
Cop looking for a charge to give someone

785
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:18,208
Nothing immediately popped up a cop fell back on well you really stupid balloons

786
00:37:18,464 --> 00:37:20,768
As a strategy

787
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,328
Exactly

788
00:37:23,584 --> 00:37:29,728
The important very important variable that Alex is leaving out of this coverage

789
00:37:29,984 --> 00:37:32,800
Intentionally I believe

790
00:37:33,312 --> 00:37:35,872
Alex's intentionally leaving the side of the story because he wants

791
00:37:36,128 --> 00:37:38,432
The angle to be the Environmental Protection laws

792
00:37:38,688 --> 00:37:40,992
Trojan Horse

793
00:37:41,504 --> 00:37:47,648
The last thing he wants is for his audience to consider for a second maybe was actually going on here is that this is maybe an inch

794
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:48,672
Horse over

795
00:37:48,928 --> 00:37:49,696
Policing of minority

796
00:37:50,464 --> 00:37:52,512
Which is probably a more

797
00:37:53,792 --> 00:37:57,376
Realistic way to look at the story based on the reporting I saw on

798
00:37:57,888 --> 00:38:00,448
That does seem to be what the the cases

799
00:38:00,704 --> 00:38:01,216
I f****** hate

800
00:38:02,496 --> 00:38:06,080
Bummer bummer story

801
00:38:07,616 --> 00:38:09,408
Reality of the story be warped

802
00:38:09,664 --> 00:38:12,736
By someone

803
00:38:13,248 --> 00:38:15,552
McDonald's

804
00:38:15,808 --> 00:38:16,832
Story that everybody's

805
00:38:17,088 --> 00:38:19,648
Still pulls that b******* on where the lady with the cup

806
00:38:19,904 --> 00:38:20,928
The lady with the cup

807
00:38:21,184 --> 00:38:23,232
The hot coffee still that like

808
00:38:23,488 --> 00:38:26,816
Oh you didn't know it was going to be hot

809
00:38:27,328 --> 00:38:28,096
Can you read into it you're like

810
00:38:28,352 --> 00:38:30,656
This is a story about Corporation

811
00:38:30,912 --> 00:38:31,936
F****** over every

812
00:38:32,448 --> 00:38:35,008
It's not a story about a woman who didn't know coffee with

813
00:38:35,776 --> 00:38:39,104
Admit that I do believe

814
00:38:39,872 --> 00:38:40,384
She knew coffee

815
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:46,528
Okay I will agree with you I will agree with your member looking into it a long time ago but I don't

816
00:38:47,552 --> 00:38:48,064
Speak on it

817
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:52,416
But I'm going to trust your version

818
00:38:52,672 --> 00:38:53,696
Corporations

819
00:38:53,952 --> 00:38:56,768
Cutting costs wherever and whenever they could to the detriment

820
00:38:57,024 --> 00:38:58,560
And pain of everybody around

821
00:38:58,816 --> 00:39:00,864
And they'd already been warned not to do it

822
00:39:01,376 --> 00:39:05,216
She's absolutely they should have been sued before they

823
00:39:05,984 --> 00:39:09,568
And it's just a few infuriating thing cuz every time you look at this Visa

824
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:11,360
Like short

825
00:39:11,616 --> 00:39:12,384
And you know like

826
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:15,968
Sherry

827
00:39:17,248 --> 00:39:19,040
You're not mad at the right person

828
00:39:19,552 --> 00:39:20,064
Yeah

829
00:39:20,576 --> 00:39:21,344
Corporations are people

830
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:22,368
They are

831
00:39:23,392 --> 00:39:26,976
Alex goes all frantic

832
00:39:27,488 --> 00:39:28,000
The

833
00:39:28,256 --> 00:39:29,024
The guy who gets arrested

834
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:29,792
Search for balloons

835
00:39:30,304 --> 00:39:31,584
Going to go to prison for 5 Years cuz

836
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:33,120
Environmental cop

837
00:39:34,144 --> 00:39:35,424
Is a natural transition

838
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:37,984
And for him to talk about how he got jammed up for

839
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:44,384
Giving out flyers at sxsw

840
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:46,176
Caller has a really good question

841
00:39:46,688 --> 00:39:47,712
For him about that

842
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:48,480
Situation

843
00:39:49,248 --> 00:39:51,040
I haven't heard you reported on

844
00:39:51,296 --> 00:39:52,832
And I'm very interested in them

845
00:39:53,344 --> 00:39:55,648
The number of internal affairs complaints

846
00:39:55,904 --> 00:40:00,768
You and your streak thing that's filed against the various officers and be various departments

847
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:05,632
It is important to file these even if you don't think you'll get a satisfactory

848
00:40:05,888 --> 00:40:07,424
Because of the very least

849
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:09,216
You're getting these reports

850
00:40:09,728 --> 00:40:15,872
Record just like it should track equine

851
00:40:21,504 --> 00:40:23,552
Shop by Southwest

852
00:40:24,064 --> 00:40:25,088
So this is

853
00:40:25,344 --> 00:40:28,672
So damn indicative of what's wrong with Alex's approach toward

854
00:40:28,928 --> 00:40:30,208
These supposed tyranny he imagined

855
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:37,376
He complained that he was a victim of gestapo tactics while he's out trying to give out

856
00:40:39,168 --> 00:40:43,520
The story is now becoming ballast involve not only the actual police trying to intimidate him

857
00:40:43,776 --> 00:40:45,824
But also hired goons threatening

858
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:46,592
18 which is

859
00:40:47,104 --> 00:40:47,616
Seriously f***** up

860
00:40:47,872 --> 00:40:48,640
To happen if it were

861
00:40:48,896 --> 00:40:49,408
True at all

862
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:52,992
Alex has an action prove to me that this story is most likely

863
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,808
Because it clearly demonstrates that

864
00:40:56,064 --> 00:40:57,600
He says is the problem

865
00:40:57,856 --> 00:40:58,368
Tyrannical

866
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:00,416
There's not something he's at all interested

867
00:41:00,672 --> 00:41:01,184
Didn't Sullivan

868
00:41:01,696 --> 00:41:06,048
You want attention out of this he wants to create the appearance that he's having his rights trampled on

869
00:41:06,304 --> 00:41:07,328
Do you want the opportunity

870
00:41:07,584 --> 00:41:08,352
Turn this into a sales

871
00:41:08,864 --> 00:41:10,144
But what he doesn't want is

872
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:15,264
Uses of an opening to help bring about real change in the system he makes money by railing against

873
00:41:15,776 --> 00:41:17,312
Because that would be bad for business

874
00:41:18,336 --> 00:41:19,616
First they came for my

875
00:41:21,664 --> 00:41:22,432
I lied about it

876
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:24,480
And screamed about it

877
00:41:24,736 --> 00:41:25,504
Nothing

878
00:41:26,272 --> 00:41:28,320
They came for minorities right

879
00:41:28,832 --> 00:41:30,112
And I lied about it

880
00:41:30,368 --> 00:41:33,184
And screamed about it on the radio and made a lot of money and nothing happens

881
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:35,744
And then I just made a lot of money and nothing

882
00:41:36,256 --> 00:41:37,280
Because I'm not going to do any

883
00:41:39,072 --> 00:41:45,216
I meant if you're only reason to exist as a business is to scream that out-of-control government and police depression why would you ever

884
00:41:45,472 --> 00:41:48,800
Try to decrease the level of out-of-control government in Felicia fraction

885
00:41:49,824 --> 00:41:55,967
Why would you why would you ever go through the painful and difficult process of advocating for wheelchair

886
00:41:56,223 --> 00:41:58,271
Change in pursuing it through the proper channels when

887
00:41:58,527 --> 00:42:00,575
This creating a fictional version of your own

888
00:42:00,831 --> 00:42:04,159
Struggle and yelling about them much more profitable

889
00:42:04,927 --> 00:42:08,511
How much is excuse that he has too good of a heart to file internal complaints

890
00:42:09,023 --> 00:42:10,047
Howard Lee cop out

891
00:42:10,559 --> 00:42:13,119
If you saw a dollar sign in it he be filing those reports

892
00:42:13,375 --> 00:42:16,191
And honestly him filing internal reports really only works

893
00:42:17,983 --> 00:42:20,543
If he's making all this stuff up would you almost certainly is

894
00:42:20,799 --> 00:42:23,103
Trouble for filing false complaints

895
00:42:24,383 --> 00:42:28,223
Conversely if he's not making it up genuine genuine departmental performance

896
00:42:28,479 --> 00:42:29,759
Completely counter to his agenda

897
00:42:30,015 --> 00:42:33,343
If the police start operating in ways he's all in favor of he'll have no

898
00:42:35,135 --> 00:42:36,927
It's just to me I think it's so damn it

899
00:42:37,183 --> 00:42:39,487
When a guy calls in is like I'd like to ask about like

900
00:42:39,999 --> 00:42:46,143
Defile internal reports trouble

901
00:42:46,399 --> 00:42:48,447
In trouble

902
00:42:48,703 --> 00:42:52,543
Play Stan that's such b******* b*******

903
00:42:52,799 --> 00:42:58,943
It's so against what he's for crack

904
00:42:59,199 --> 00:43:00,223
Back in his Visage

905
00:43:00,735 --> 00:43:02,271
And it just flies past

906
00:43:02,527 --> 00:43:03,807
Like I'm sure most people listening

907
00:43:07,391 --> 00:43:08,927
Consider for a second but like

908
00:43:09,439 --> 00:43:10,207
Oh hold on

909
00:43:10,719 --> 00:43:11,999
This is crazy

910
00:43:12,511 --> 00:43:13,791
This is this really makes

911
00:43:17,887 --> 00:43:18,655
The sex work

912
00:43:18,911 --> 00:43:19,423
S*** is

913
00:43:19,679 --> 00:43:20,703
Going to be number one

914
00:43:25,823 --> 00:43:26,335
And you could make

915
00:43:26,591 --> 00:43:28,383
81 of 10 million

916
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:29,407
Just even up pause

917
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:33,503
Somebody trying

918
00:43:33,759 --> 00:43:37,343
To stop traffic I do I agree with you the reason I think

919
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:38,111
Slightly

920
00:43:38,367 --> 00:43:40,159
Isn't this case Alex has standings

921
00:43:40,415 --> 00:43:40,927
To file these

922
00:43:41,183 --> 00:43:45,023
Complaint department

923
00:43:45,279 --> 00:43:47,839
Yeah and he doesn't take action

924
00:43:49,375 --> 00:43:50,143
More damning

925
00:43:50,399 --> 00:43:50,911
Yeah you're right

926
00:43:51,167 --> 00:43:53,471
There is

927
00:43:53,727 --> 00:43:54,239
Sue the city

928
00:43:54,751 --> 00:43:55,263
You could

929
00:43:55,519 --> 00:43:57,311
Bring about departmental change

930
00:43:57,823 --> 00:43:58,591
In the way that

931
00:43:58,847 --> 00:44:00,127
You feel is in line with

932
00:44:00,895 --> 00:44:01,919
Diffusion Norte

933
00:44:03,455 --> 00:44:04,991
Or even you could make a little money to

934
00:44:05,503 --> 00:44:09,343
Sherpa

935
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:11,647
Chicken bake motor Shut up

936
00:44:15,487 --> 00:44:17,279
What if Barnes is right in 2013

937
00:44:19,071 --> 00:44:24,703
TV living on an island somewhere

938
00:44:25,215 --> 00:44:25,727
Sagara

939
00:44:25,983 --> 00:44:29,055
Ears billions of dollars disappear Alex need to take over

940
00:44:29,823 --> 00:44:31,615
So this last clip from the 17th

941
00:44:31,871 --> 00:44:32,383
It's not that

942
00:44:32,895 --> 00:44:34,943
Michelle Alex's at complaining

943
00:44:35,199 --> 00:44:35,711
Carac

944
00:44:38,527 --> 00:44:39,039
Things that work

945
00:44:40,575 --> 00:44:43,391
This is true under under hr32

946
00:44:43,647 --> 00:44:45,951
1521 that we all have to be chick

947
00:44:46,207 --> 00:44:52,351
Obamacare

948
00:44:55,679 --> 00:44:58,495
Saraga

949
00:44:59,007 --> 00:44:59,519
First things for

950
00:45:00,031 --> 00:45:03,359
Of course the Affordable Care Act didn't require or pay for people to get

951
00:45:03,871 --> 00:45:04,383
Naturally

952
00:45:04,639 --> 00:45:07,455
However there was like early house version

953
00:45:07,967 --> 00:45:11,039
The Bell that really got Dum Dums on the right all worked up

954
00:45:11,295 --> 00:45:15,391
Particularly ones with preoccupations about the end times

955
00:45:16,671 --> 00:45:18,975
The provisions of the early draft were related

956
00:45:19,231 --> 00:45:21,535
To creating a database for the Department of Health and Human

957
00:45:21,791 --> 00:45:23,071
Human Services of people

958
00:45:23,327 --> 00:45:23,839
Pacemaker

959
00:45:24,095 --> 00:45:24,863
Replacement body

960
00:45:25,887 --> 00:45:28,959
Their reasoning was that if there was a centralized database

961
00:45:29,215 --> 00:45:31,263
Things I can more easily study the efficacy of

962
00:45:31,519 --> 00:45:32,543
Implantable devices

963
00:45:32,799 --> 00:45:34,079
And probably more important

964
00:45:34,335 --> 00:45:35,103
Naked informed

965
00:45:35,615 --> 00:45:36,895
Boomers way more quickly wedding

966
00:45:37,663 --> 00:45:38,175
Recalls

967
00:45:38,431 --> 00:45:40,223
Of medical products like that of this

968
00:45:40,479 --> 00:45:45,599
Which is really important

969
00:45:47,391 --> 00:45:50,207
Crazy

970
00:45:50,463 --> 00:45:52,511
Implantable medical devices one gets

971
00:45:52,767 --> 00:45:58,911
Recalled knowing who you need to get it out of dangerous

972
00:46:00,447 --> 00:46:02,495
It's very the number

973
00:46:02,751 --> 00:46:03,519
People who file complaints

974
00:46:03,775 --> 00:46:04,543
The FDA

975
00:46:04,799 --> 00:46:06,591
Of injuries related in plants

976
00:46:06,847 --> 00:46:09,407
Device is much higher than people realize

977
00:46:09,663 --> 00:46:11,199
Yeah

978
00:46:12,479 --> 00:46:16,319
There are some folks unfortunately

979
00:46:16,831 --> 00:46:20,159
So these are really important

980
00:46:20,415 --> 00:46:21,183
For obvious reasons

981
00:46:21,695 --> 00:46:23,743
However this language was taken out of the phone

982
00:46:23,999 --> 00:46:25,791
Final version of ACA that eventually passed

983
00:46:26,047 --> 00:46:26,559
Through Congress

984
00:46:26,815 --> 00:46:29,119
He was basically just lying about things that doesn't

985
00:46:29,887 --> 00:46:30,399
End up being

986
00:46:31,423 --> 00:46:32,959
Event at buy this one

987
00:46:33,215 --> 00:46:33,983
He has ever read

988
00:46:34,239 --> 00:46:34,751
Even to know that it's not

989
00:46:35,775 --> 00:46:37,311
These databases actually already

990
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:39,359
BFDI freeze instant

991
00:46:39,615 --> 00:46:40,639
Which is housed under the

992
00:46:40,895 --> 00:46:41,407
The DHHS

993
00:46:41,919 --> 00:46:43,455
Keep the registry of people laugh and plaster

994
00:46:43,711 --> 00:46:44,479
What medical devices

995
00:46:44,735 --> 00:46:47,295
Because without that they'd be unable to appropriately respond to

996
00:46:48,063 --> 00:46:48,575
Complained

997
00:46:49,087 --> 00:46:53,695
Why was obviously benefits to expanding the data available to provide people with better care

998
00:46:53,951 --> 00:46:54,975
This complaint that Alex

999
00:46:55,231 --> 00:46:55,743
Does making is

1000
00:46:56,255 --> 00:46:56,767
The real thing

1001
00:46:57,023 --> 00:46:59,583
At all it got taken out of the bill Alex's just yelling

1002
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:00,351
Shadows

1003
00:47:00,607 --> 00:47:03,167
Is caller discolored paranoid about

1004
00:47:03,423 --> 00:47:04,447
I'm picking Alex is like yeah

1005
00:47:04,959 --> 00:47:07,519
Yeah

1006
00:47:07,775 --> 00:47:08,287
Modeling

1007
00:47:09,311 --> 00:47:09,823
So

1008
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:15,199
Do you know which model of pacemaker you have for sure so even if they put out a call Lovey

1009
00:47:18,271 --> 00:47:18,783
Replaced

1010
00:47:19,039 --> 00:47:24,671
You don't know for sure if that one's yours aren't I would hope that if I had a pacemaker I would know that

1011
00:47:24,927 --> 00:47:29,279
I don't know I would be surprised if you did I would hope

1012
00:47:29,791 --> 00:47:32,095
There's a ton of

1013
00:47:32,607 --> 00:47:33,631
Just logistical

1014
00:47:34,143 --> 00:47:34,911
Public Health

1015
00:47:35,423 --> 00:47:35,935
Wise up

1016
00:47:36,191 --> 00:47:37,727
Nothing like this would be very

1017
00:47:38,239 --> 00:47:39,263
Helpful

1018
00:47:39,519 --> 00:47:40,031
Important

1019
00:47:40,543 --> 00:47:41,311
Save lives

1020
00:47:44,383 --> 00:47:45,151
Did you consider that

1021
00:47:46,175 --> 00:47:46,943
OKC

1022
00:47:47,199 --> 00:47:49,503
I understand where Alex's argument

1023
00:47:50,271 --> 00:47:52,831
Is this

1024
00:47:53,855 --> 00:47:55,647
We can move on

1025
00:47:56,159 --> 00:48:00,767
Is built on like okay so they make it okay for you.

1026
00:48:01,023 --> 00:48:02,815
Keep a registry of people who have

1027
00:48:03,071 --> 00:48:04,607
Implantable devices in them

1028
00:48:04,863 --> 00:48:11,007
Then they're going to just have everybody slippers

1029
00:48:11,263 --> 00:48:13,311
Database of people with teeth of course

1030
00:48:18,943 --> 00:48:19,455
Bright

1031
00:48:20,223 --> 00:48:20,735
It's ridiculous

1032
00:48:20,991 --> 00:48:24,063
Paranoia is built on

1033
00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:26,367
I get the beginning stages of

1034
00:48:27,391 --> 00:48:27,903
People just

1035
00:48:30,975 --> 00:48:33,791
We get to the 18th and Alex is going on

1036
00:48:34,047 --> 00:48:34,559
The paranoias

1037
00:48:36,863 --> 00:48:39,679
We've already heard him say that there's going to be a false flag

1038
00:48:40,447 --> 00:48:41,727
No

1039
00:48:41,983 --> 00:48:43,263
The Boston bombing is less

1040
00:48:43,519 --> 00:48:44,799
It's been a month away right around the corner

1041
00:48:45,311 --> 00:48:46,847
But here's the problem was that

1042
00:48:47,103 --> 00:48:48,383
His predictions of very

1043
00:48:48,639 --> 00:48:50,431
Specific about what's going to happen

1044
00:48:50,687 --> 00:48:51,455
Edit not

1045
00:48:51,967 --> 00:48:54,015
A bombing in Boston during the

1046
00:48:54,783 --> 00:48:55,295
.

1047
00:48:55,551 --> 00:48:59,903
It's not that

1048
00:49:06,303 --> 00:49:08,351
Billing office Chicago

1049
00:49:09,631 --> 00:49:14,239
Ozzy man

1050
00:49:19,103 --> 00:49:19,871
Dallas

1051
00:49:20,127 --> 00:49:21,151
Cleveland

1052
00:49:21,407 --> 00:49:23,967
Chicago

1053
00:49:33,695 --> 00:49:35,743
Helicopters flying around

1054
00:49:41,887 --> 00:49:48,031
Show a movie of all Anouk in Chicago

1055
00:49:48,287 --> 00:49:51,103
Very clear that this is the prediction he's making

1056
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:53,663
Without saying they're going to Nuke Chicago

1057
00:49:53,919 --> 00:49:55,967
Specifically because he knows that

1058
00:49:56,223 --> 00:49:57,759
And it's a chip prediction

1059
00:50:00,063 --> 00:50:00,575
Is real shotty

1060
00:50:01,087 --> 00:50:06,719
So what does happen you going to take credit for predicting it but if you look at the actual prediction

1061
00:50:07,231 --> 00:50:10,047
First of all Cleveland sent like a

1062
00:50:10,303 --> 00:50:14,655
The Chicago it's not on his radar.

1063
00:50:15,167 --> 00:50:16,191
He's talking about nukes

1064
00:50:16,703 --> 00:50:17,215
It's

1065
00:50:18,239 --> 00:50:21,823
It's not your Main Avenue of research for this

1066
00:50:23,103 --> 00:50:23,615
That was

1067
00:50:24,383 --> 00:50:26,687
Does the CFR like to brag

1068
00:50:28,735 --> 00:50:32,319
The Council on Foreign Relations

1069
00:50:32,831 --> 00:50:33,599
Bragging about

1070
00:50:33,855 --> 00:50:35,135
Can I be honest with you

1071
00:50:35,647 --> 00:50:38,719
I didn't think that was something worth looking into

1072
00:50:38,975 --> 00:50:45,119
I feel like people's definition of bracken might be different and I felt like we could get in the weeds

1073
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:46,399
Pretty quickly

1074
00:50:47,167 --> 00:50:48,191
Also

1075
00:50:48,447 --> 00:50:50,239
Ecfr membership Rollies

1076
00:50:50,495 --> 00:50:52,287
Gigantic

1077
00:50:52,543 --> 00:50:58,431
Tons of this business owner

1078
00:51:00,735 --> 00:51:03,807
Cabela's golf scores all the time

1079
00:51:06,367 --> 00:51:12,511
Chicago Chicago

1080
00:51:17,887 --> 00:51:19,423
So I'll talk more about this

1081
00:51:19,679 --> 00:51:20,191
Yes here it is

1082
00:51:21,215 --> 00:51:24,031
Chicago

1083
00:51:24,287 --> 00:51:25,823
Oops

1084
00:51:58,079 --> 00:52:00,127
The CFR really bragged about that one

1085
00:52:07,551 --> 00:52:08,063
So

1086
00:52:08,575 --> 00:52:11,647
I mean you got really specific

1087
00:52:11,903 --> 00:52:12,671
Predict

1088
00:52:13,439 --> 00:52:13,951
Going on

1089
00:52:15,743 --> 00:52:17,791
It's gradually becoming more refined

1090
00:52:18,047 --> 00:52:19,583
923 Chicago

1091
00:52:20,863 --> 00:52:22,911
And I guess Alex is way around it

1092
00:52:23,167 --> 00:52:25,727
Once the Boston bombing does

1093
00:52:25,983 --> 00:52:28,287
Well they heard me say that they were going to Nuke

1094
00:52:28,543 --> 00:52:32,383
Chicago that's how you would get around to it

1095
00:52:32,639 --> 00:52:34,175
But I don't text

1096
00:52:34,431 --> 00:52:37,759
Naturally The Playbook that he is outline for the

1097
00:52:38,271 --> 00:52:40,319
Globalist to do after he's correct

1098
00:52:40,575 --> 00:52:41,343
Is the Playbook

1099
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:42,367
Follows after

1100
00:52:42,623 --> 00:52:43,135
Incorrect

1101
00:52:43,903 --> 00:52:44,415
Yes

1102
00:52:44,671 --> 00:52:46,975
So the rest of this episode 18

1103
00:52:47,231 --> 00:52:47,743
If it's not

1104
00:52:50,815 --> 00:52:51,583
Cathy Cypress Bank

1105
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:52,607
Situation

1106
00:52:53,375 --> 00:52:53,887
I don't

1107
00:52:56,703 --> 00:52:57,983
It's so standard

1108
00:52:58,239 --> 00:52:59,007
Alex Financial

1109
00:53:00,543 --> 00:53:01,311
Exactly the same

1110
00:53:01,823 --> 00:53:02,335
And

1111
00:53:02,591 --> 00:53:03,103
I don't

1112
00:53:03,615 --> 00:53:06,175
Are the people in Cypress

1113
00:53:07,455 --> 00:53:13,599
People around the world are dealing with financial crises

1114
00:53:13,855 --> 00:53:15,647
Don't mean to be insensitive about that but Alex

1115
00:53:15,903 --> 00:53:17,439
Version of it is not something

1116
00:53:17,951 --> 00:53:18,975
I'm particularly interested

1117
00:53:19,999 --> 00:53:21,023
So we jump to the 19th

1118
00:53:21,279 --> 00:53:25,631
Edit begins with an hour-long yelling about Obama being the devil

1119
00:53:25,887 --> 00:53:28,703
Okay it's alright

1120
00:53:32,543 --> 00:53:33,055
Wow

1121
00:53:33,823 --> 00:53:34,591
Wow

1122
00:53:34,847 --> 00:53:35,615
It's just

1123
00:53:35,871 --> 00:53:36,383
Constant

1124
00:53:36,639 --> 00:53:38,175
Obama

1125
00:53:38,431 --> 00:53:39,199
I don't hurt time

1126
00:53:39,455 --> 00:53:40,479
Believing that you can

1127
00:53:41,759 --> 00:53:45,855
It's tough It's really tough

1128
00:53:46,111 --> 00:53:49,695
But really listened to the whole hour

1129
00:53:49,951 --> 00:53:51,743
Stupid commercials

1130
00:53:52,767 --> 00:53:56,095
I would make it through 50 minutes

1131
00:53:56,607 --> 00:53:57,631
Moorhead

1132
00:53:58,143 --> 00:54:04,031
I think during it I just I did go a couple times

1133
00:54:04,287 --> 00:54:04,799
I did

1134
00:54:13,247 --> 00:54:19,135
The world

1135
00:54:35,519 --> 00:54:36,799
Pretty Goods

1136
00:54:37,055 --> 00:54:38,591
Glimpse in his world

1137
00:54:38,847 --> 00:54:39,359
I guess

1138
00:54:39,615 --> 00:54:40,639
Now I'm confused

1139
00:54:41,151 --> 00:54:41,663
Do you think he's

1140
00:54:41,919 --> 00:54:42,687
Actually read

1141
00:54:42,943 --> 00:54:43,967
The hobbes's Leviathan

1142
00:54:44,223 --> 00:54:46,015
No there's no way right

1143
00:54:46,271 --> 00:54:47,039
I don't think so

1144
00:54:47,295 --> 00:54:49,599
I think you seen it referenced unlike Patriot vlogs

1145
00:54:49,855 --> 00:54:50,623
Okay

1146
00:54:50,879 --> 00:54:52,415
I think most of his information

1147
00:54:52,927 --> 00:54:53,439
Through those doors

1148
00:54:57,279 --> 00:54:58,815
I information that traces back

1149
00:54:59,071 --> 00:55:02,399
To these groups like the Jews for the preservation of firearms ownership

1150
00:55:02,655 --> 00:55:04,191
Forgot owners for America

1151
00:55:04,447 --> 00:55:05,215
There's so much

1152
00:55:05,727 --> 00:55:06,239
Stop that like

1153
00:55:06,751 --> 00:55:07,775
We getting second

1154
00:55:08,031 --> 00:55:08,543
Third hand

1155
00:55:09,823 --> 00:55:12,895
Pretending

1156
00:55:13,151 --> 00:55:17,247
He's really just read skousen capitalist

1157
00:55:18,527 --> 00:55:22,367
If he gives himself credit for reading the original thing as opposed to

1158
00:55:22,623 --> 00:55:24,671
Or even jumpy Holdren's ecoscience

1159
00:55:25,183 --> 00:55:28,511
Yeah he claims he's read that there is no chance you've read that

1160
00:55:28,767 --> 00:55:29,535
No textbook

1161
00:55:30,047 --> 00:55:36,191
It's a textbook yeah he's read the little excerpts that are posted on that out

1162
00:55:36,447 --> 00:55:40,287
Their weapon attack the fluoride in the water and lava blocks

1163
00:55:41,311 --> 00:55:42,591
Though he's never read la vie

1164
00:55:43,103 --> 00:55:45,919
I'm positive it's just fun for me whenever all of a sudden

1165
00:55:46,431 --> 00:55:46,943
He uses some

1166
00:55:47,199 --> 00:55:47,711
Something like that

1167
00:55:48,991 --> 00:55:50,015
Is it correctly or you're like

1168
00:55:50,527 --> 00:55:54,367
Hey it's somebody else had to avoid another word for the devil

1169
00:55:56,415 --> 00:55:58,719
The term for the devil

1170
00:56:05,887 --> 00:56:07,167
That's the one I like

1171
00:56:07,423 --> 00:56:10,495
I love the other one

1172
00:56:10,751 --> 00:56:11,263
Alex

1173
00:56:15,359 --> 00:56:16,895
At this point

1174
00:56:17,151 --> 00:56:18,175
Because the devil

1175
00:56:18,431 --> 00:56:19,199
The skinny one

1176
00:56:19,711 --> 00:56:20,223
Just fun

1177
00:56:21,759 --> 00:56:23,295
Because of this Cypress

1178
00:56:24,319 --> 00:56:25,599
Financial

1179
00:56:25,855 --> 00:56:27,391
Involved

1180
00:56:27,647 --> 00:56:28,415
Money and Bank

1181
00:56:28,671 --> 00:56:29,695
Is suspicious

1182
00:56:29,951 --> 00:56:30,463
Yeah yeah

1183
00:56:30,719 --> 00:56:31,743
Around this time

1184
00:56:31,999 --> 00:56:33,535
Also there was

1185
00:56:33,791 --> 00:56:34,559
Chase Bank

1186
00:56:34,815 --> 00:56:37,375
Glitch that happened with their internal systems

1187
00:56:37,887 --> 00:56:39,423
That made some users

1188
00:56:39,679 --> 00:56:41,215
Accounts show a zero balance

1189
00:56:41,983 --> 00:56:43,519
It was resolved fairly quickly

1190
00:56:43,775 --> 00:56:45,311
They has been pretty

1191
00:56:45,823 --> 00:56:46,847
Consistent

1192
00:56:47,103 --> 00:56:48,383
Understatement that it wasn't

1193
00:56:48,639 --> 00:56:51,199
It was a malfunctioning

1194
00:56:51,455 --> 00:56:55,039
Internal algorithms are or whatever

1195
00:56:55,551 --> 00:56:57,855
Yeah I don't see any evidence

1196
00:56:58,111 --> 00:57:00,927
That it was a hack or anything the fairies

1197
00:57:01,183 --> 00:57:01,695
Astronomy

1198
00:57:01,951 --> 00:57:03,743
Clearing out People's Bank account

1199
00:57:04,255 --> 00:57:05,279
Alex

1200
00:57:06,559 --> 00:57:07,327
Something up

1201
00:57:09,119 --> 00:57:10,655
There is a local news story

1202
00:57:10,911 --> 00:57:12,703
Where they interviewed somebody

1203
00:57:12,959 --> 00:57:13,471
About

1204
00:57:13,727 --> 00:57:15,263
This Chase Bank

1205
00:57:15,519 --> 00:57:16,031
Glitch

1206
00:57:17,055 --> 00:57:18,591
A caller calls in

1207
00:57:19,103 --> 00:57:20,383
Talk about house that was the

1208
00:57:20,639 --> 00:57:22,943
Suspicious

1209
00:57:23,199 --> 00:57:23,967
This is very

1210
00:57:24,223 --> 00:57:24,735
Important

1211
00:57:25,247 --> 00:57:27,551
What's your take on this

1212
00:57:30,623 --> 00:57:31,647
Definitely

1213
00:57:32,671 --> 00:57:37,023
The fact that they did that thing with Chase and if you notice the guy in the clip said

1214
00:57:37,279 --> 00:57:40,095
He had faith that the government would step in

1215
00:57:40,351 --> 00:57:45,215
In case it was something serious

1216
00:58:26,431 --> 00:58:30,015
Amazing

1217
00:58:30,527 --> 00:58:36,671
So Alex has decided this guy who said that I believe the government will intervene

1218
00:58:37,695 --> 00:58:39,999
Literally

1219
00:58:40,255 --> 00:58:43,071
Yeah so this guy who's

1220
00:58:43,327 --> 00:58:43,839
In this

1221
00:58:44,095 --> 00:58:47,423
Local news interview Alex has decided as an actor

1222
00:58:47,679 --> 00:58:49,215
This is a

1223
00:58:49,471 --> 00:58:51,263
Massive important job

1224
00:58:51,519 --> 00:58:53,567
Yeah cuz it opens up the door

1225
00:58:53,823 --> 00:58:54,847
To be like wow

1226
00:58:55,103 --> 00:58:58,943
If they're using actors to shape the public opinion on

1227
00:58:59,455 --> 00:59:01,247
How far are we away from

1228
00:59:01,503 --> 00:59:03,039
We're we're ending up at night

1229
00:59:03,551 --> 00:59:05,087
His hit this was a

1230
00:59:05,343 --> 00:59:05,855
Respect

1231
00:59:06,111 --> 00:59:07,391
Secular example of

1232
00:59:07,647 --> 00:59:08,927
Yes anding turned

1233
00:59:09,439 --> 00:59:09,951
New Prius

1234
00:59:10,463 --> 00:59:14,559
Y'all y'all figured out the universe

1235
00:59:15,071 --> 00:59:15,839
Like that

1236
00:59:16,095 --> 00:59:17,119
That is such a

1237
00:59:17,375 --> 00:59:18,143
Coked-up like

1238
00:59:18,655 --> 00:59:24,799
Yeah I thought it was really weird

1239
00:59:25,311 --> 00:59:27,615
They're all actors

1240
00:59:32,735 --> 00:59:35,039
You made up this whole story about directing your

1241
00:59:36,831 --> 00:59:39,903
I highly doubt it

1242
00:59:40,415 --> 00:59:45,791
No I think it I think it's an interesting thought that he arrived on because of the colors

1243
00:59:46,047 --> 00:59:46,815
Suspicion in Maui

1244
00:59:47,327 --> 00:59:49,887
He's adding a lot of little bushes

1245
00:59:50,143 --> 00:59:51,935
To increase the background of this pic

1246
00:59:52,703 --> 00:59:55,007
You know what they're like it's

1247
00:59:55,263 --> 00:59:56,543
It's really interests

1248
00:59:57,567 --> 01:00:01,407
That's why I think it's important to point out that the Cypress

1249
01:00:01,663 --> 01:00:02,431
Situation is happening

1250
01:00:04,735 --> 01:00:05,247
Construction

1251
01:00:05,503 --> 01:00:08,063
How is financial lies are always the same and it's all

1252
01:00:08,319 --> 01:00:08,831
Hispanic

1253
01:00:09,087 --> 01:00:09,599
Buy gold

1254
01:00:09,855 --> 01:00:10,879
We've got a 300 up

1255
01:00:11,135 --> 01:00:12,415
I think it's important

1256
01:00:12,671 --> 01:00:14,975
Because it does live in the background of what's making him

1257
01:00:15,231 --> 01:00:15,999
Suspicious about the

1258
01:00:16,255 --> 01:00:17,279
Situation

1259
01:00:17,535 --> 01:00:18,047
And those

1260
01:00:18,303 --> 01:00:19,583
Efficient

1261
01:00:19,839 --> 01:00:23,679
Glitch make him suspicious of the news report about it

1262
01:00:24,959 --> 01:00:29,311
I don't know if that's an entirely what's motivating him to say that this guy in the

1263
01:00:29,567 --> 01:00:33,407
News story about the chase glitches an actor but it's a piece of

1264
01:00:33,663 --> 01:00:36,735
Part of the feedback loop

1265
01:00:36,991 --> 01:00:40,063
If he's watching all of the

1266
01:00:40,319 --> 01:00:41,599
All of these papers

1267
01:00:41,855 --> 01:00:42,367
Bullshiter

1268
01:00:42,623 --> 01:00:43,135
Coming about

1269
01:00:43,647 --> 01:00:44,927
Sandy Hook being staged in

1270
01:00:45,183 --> 01:00:45,695
Thanks

1271
01:00:45,951 --> 01:00:48,511
Staged and fake is in his mind all the time

1272
01:00:49,023 --> 01:00:50,047
Constantly so

1273
01:00:50,303 --> 01:00:53,887
If he gets something like this this is a perfect opportunity for his brain to go like

1274
01:00:54,911 --> 01:00:58,751
It's fake let's jump on it first exactly the way you was trying to

1275
01:00:59,007 --> 01:00:59,775
Cover shooting

1276
01:01:00,031 --> 01:01:01,055
Yes

1277
01:01:01,311 --> 01:01:07,455
Do you know what he was trying to be like

1278
01:01:07,711 --> 01:01:08,479
His own

1279
01:01:09,503 --> 01:01:11,039
This is an actor thing

1280
01:01:12,319 --> 01:01:13,087
Have a stake in the market

1281
01:01:13,855 --> 01:01:14,879
Unrelated

1282
01:01:15,135 --> 01:01:16,415
But still very lucrative

1283
01:01:16,671 --> 01:01:17,695
Kickbacks

1284
01:01:17,951 --> 01:01:19,743
Places maybe get some SEO

1285
01:01:19,999 --> 01:01:22,047
I think it's pretty interesting

1286
01:01:22,303 --> 01:01:22,815
Soylent

1287
01:01:23,071 --> 01:01:29,215
His assertion that this guy in the news report was probably an actor I think probably

1288
01:01:29,471 --> 01:01:30,495
The lamest way possible

1289
01:01:31,263 --> 01:01:33,567
Driver show

1290
01:01:36,383 --> 01:01:38,431
Ask him questions Cash Cab

1291
01:01:48,671 --> 01:01:51,999
Immediately

1292
01:01:52,511 --> 01:01:55,327
Everybody else

1293
01:02:45,503 --> 01:02:47,807
2013 comedies

1294
01:02:49,087 --> 01:02:53,695
Scab is an example of why

1295
01:02:54,207 --> 01:02:55,487
The news interview was intact

1296
01:02:55,999 --> 01:03:02,143
Bailey

1297
01:03:03,167 --> 01:03:04,703
Missouri back before I move to

1298
01:03:04,959 --> 01:03:05,983
Chicago I did

1299
01:03:07,519 --> 01:03:13,663
I don't I didn't want I didn't spend much time with him but he was nice and I think he had a bit about birds that I thought was bad

1300
01:03:18,783 --> 01:03:19,551
Yes

1301
01:03:19,807 --> 01:03:23,903
A number of people who are on the Cash Cab as contestants are also comedian

1302
01:03:24,159 --> 01:03:25,695
Aspiring actors

1303
01:03:26,207 --> 01:03:32,351
That is normal calls into your morning radio shows

1304
01:03:32,607 --> 01:03:33,887
Real people dab

1305
01:03:34,143 --> 01:03:36,703
I think that it's part of the show business at

1306
01:03:36,959 --> 01:03:38,495
I honestly think

1307
01:03:39,007 --> 01:03:40,799
If you're running a show like Cash Cab

1308
01:03:41,055 --> 01:03:43,103
Doing it any other way is

1309
01:03:43,359 --> 01:03:43,871
Impossible

1310
01:03:44,127 --> 01:03:45,151
The idea of

1311
01:03:45,407 --> 01:03:47,967
Having a completely unknown variable get in

1312
01:03:48,223 --> 01:03:48,735
A very

1313
01:03:48,991 --> 01:03:49,759
Controlled

1314
01:03:50,015 --> 01:03:52,319
Space where you're running again

1315
01:03:52,575 --> 01:03:53,343
It's

1316
01:03:58,975 --> 01:04:00,511
So much money on shooting

1317
01:04:00,767 --> 01:04:02,303
Like

1318
01:04:02,815 --> 01:04:07,423
Issues of people needing to fill out tax forms in

1319
01:04:07,679 --> 01:04:09,727
If you just pick people up off the street

1320
01:04:09,983 --> 01:04:10,751
Like you can't

1321
01:04:11,007 --> 01:04:16,127
Have them fill out the paperwork after runaway you can pay them just in cash

1322
01:04:16,383 --> 01:04:20,223
Like I do

1323
01:04:20,991 --> 01:04:23,039
I don't want to get into it

1324
01:04:23,295 --> 01:04:27,135
If you think reality TV it 100% real then blood get the

1325
01:04:27,391 --> 01:04:30,975
A produced

1326
01:04:31,743 --> 01:04:32,767
Keisha like

1327
01:04:33,279 --> 01:04:34,559
Something

1328
01:04:35,071 --> 01:04:38,655
If he's using that as an example of like every

1329
01:04:38,911 --> 01:04:39,679
Interviewee

1330
01:04:39,935 --> 01:04:42,495
A local news could be fake

1331
01:04:42,751 --> 01:04:44,543
It's it's it's

1332
01:04:45,567 --> 01:04:51,455
I don't use the word slippery slope it's just stupid allow your brain to

1333
01:04:51,711 --> 01:04:52,479
Start thinking about

1334
01:04:53,247 --> 01:04:54,015
Because it opens up

1335
01:04:57,343 --> 01:04:58,623
The Pyro diminished

1336
01:04:58,879 --> 01:04:59,903
Credulity

1337
01:05:00,159 --> 01:05:01,183
Required

1338
01:05:02,463 --> 01:05:04,255
And even then even within your b*******

1339
01:05:07,839 --> 01:05:08,863
Cuz now you're getting people

1340
01:05:11,167 --> 01:05:11,935
You got to pull out a cat

1341
01:05:12,191 --> 01:05:13,727
Casting call or you have actors

1342
01:05:14,239 --> 01:05:15,007
Tugonon

1343
01:05:15,263 --> 01:05:16,543
On retainer

1344
01:05:18,591 --> 01:05:23,711
Get somebody in the production crew to walk in front me like I was a baby I'm fine with it

1345
01:05:25,503 --> 01:05:27,295
This was

1346
01:05:27,551 --> 01:05:28,831
Top

1347
01:05:29,087 --> 01:05:29,599
Big

1348
01:05:29,855 --> 01:05:31,135
Because it is a departure in

1349
01:05:31,647 --> 01:05:32,159
Is narrative

1350
01:05:33,183 --> 01:05:37,023
And then he starts talking about it a little bit more interview

1351
01:05:37,791 --> 01:05:38,303
And

1352
01:05:38,559 --> 01:05:39,071
He

1353
01:05:39,327 --> 01:05:42,655
Expensive about this subject

1354
01:05:43,167 --> 01:05:43,679
Factor

1355
01:05:44,191 --> 01:05:46,239
Do territory that I have not heard before

1356
01:05:47,007 --> 01:05:50,847
This is very very very very suspicious

1357
01:05:51,615 --> 01:05:57,759
Deal

1358
01:06:04,927 --> 01:06:07,487
Found instances of movie actors

1359
01:06:09,023 --> 01:06:13,887
About how they survived who just so happened to be in the Aurora shooting

1360
01:06:15,423 --> 01:06:19,775
Moderate

1361
01:06:23,103 --> 01:06:24,639
I don't think it was Lee major

1362
01:06:25,151 --> 01:06:28,735
Never up to this point if there were crisis actor

1363
01:06:29,247 --> 01:06:29,759
Using your aura

1364
01:06:30,527 --> 01:06:36,671
He said that James Holmes of the Mind Control killer and all that s*** we've gone over in detail already but I've not heard him

1365
01:06:37,183 --> 01:06:39,487
Accusation that are actors

1366
01:06:40,767 --> 01:06:41,535
The departure

1367
01:06:41,791 --> 01:06:42,303
And his rhetoric

1368
01:06:43,071 --> 01:06:46,911
I tried to trace down the particular people he's talking about but I can't really find any

1369
01:06:47,167 --> 01:06:47,935
Good resources

1370
01:06:48,191 --> 01:06:49,983
About what's going on here

1371
01:06:50,239 --> 01:06:54,591
And even if I could I feel like naming the people he's accusing being actors does more harm than good at the

1372
01:06:54,847 --> 01:06:56,639
This point even if it's in service of deacon

1373
01:06:56,895 --> 01:06:59,199
Constructing is why it was weird whenever they

1374
01:06:59,967 --> 01:07:00,479
George Clooney interview

1375
01:07:01,759 --> 01:07:02,783
It was weird

1376
01:07:03,039 --> 01:07:07,391
There is a possibility that someone who was

1377
01:07:07,647 --> 01:07:13,791
In the theatre was also an actor

1378
01:07:14,047 --> 01:07:14,559
In that movie

1379
01:07:18,655 --> 01:07:21,983
But I think if I had to guess based on the distinguish

1380
01:07:22,239 --> 01:07:23,775
Ocean characteristics Alex provide

1381
01:07:24,287 --> 01:07:26,079
I think I kind of know who he's talking

1382
01:07:26,335 --> 01:07:26,847
Sing about

1383
01:07:27,103 --> 01:07:31,455
There's one African-American guy who posted a video on YouTube describing his experience being a

1384
01:07:31,711 --> 01:07:32,223
In the theater when the

1385
01:07:32,479 --> 01:07:32,991
Shooting happen

1386
01:07:33,247 --> 01:07:36,319
And this guy was immediately attacked by conspiracy theorist is being

1387
01:07:37,855 --> 01:07:41,695
I assume that this is one of the people that Alex is talking about since he fits Alex's

1388
01:07:41,951 --> 01:07:42,463
Description

1389
01:07:43,487 --> 01:07:49,375
There's no evidence whatsoever outside of unfounded accusations on conspiracy message board

1390
01:07:50,399 --> 01:07:51,679
The second person Isis

1391
01:07:51,935 --> 01:07:55,775
Suspect is a Hispanic man who was interviewed on Good Morning America after

1392
01:07:56,031 --> 01:07:56,543
The shooting

1393
01:07:57,055 --> 01:07:59,103
He survived the shooting and described his experiences

1394
01:07:59,359 --> 01:08:01,919
Stipulating a lot while being interviewed

1395
01:08:02,175 --> 01:08:03,711
Would you like to be receipts Lutz online

1396
01:08:04,479 --> 01:08:04,991
He was an actor

1397
01:08:05,503 --> 01:08:09,343
I really don't think people understand how adrenaline can really f*** with you and high-pressure

1398
01:08:09,599 --> 01:08:10,111
Situation

1399
01:08:10,623 --> 01:08:16,511
Like if anybody thinks that talking with your hands a lot is a strange behavior for someone who's being interviewed on National Television for the

1400
01:08:16,767 --> 01:08:17,279
The first time

1401
01:08:17,535 --> 01:08:19,583
I really think that they've never tried public speaker

1402
01:08:20,351 --> 01:08:23,423
I would predict that if they had to get up in front of a room is like 100 people

1403
01:08:23,679 --> 01:08:24,191
And say something

1404
01:08:24,447 --> 01:08:24,959
Bachelor

1405
01:08:25,215 --> 01:08:27,007
Possibly emotionally resonant

1406
01:08:27,263 --> 01:08:30,591
They would find their delivery might not be totally natural or casual either

1407
01:08:31,871 --> 01:08:36,991
That's as closely fit Alex's description but he's another person who survived the Aurora shooting who's a

1408
01:08:37,247 --> 01:08:38,015
Accused of being an actor

1409
01:08:38,527 --> 01:08:40,831
I've gone through a bit of this stuff

1410
01:08:41,087 --> 01:08:41,599
Digging around

1411
01:08:41,855 --> 01:08:43,135
Literally nothing

1412
01:08:43,391 --> 01:08:43,903
Topeka

1413
01:08:44,159 --> 01:08:44,671
Compelling evidence

1414
01:08:45,183 --> 01:08:46,719
Nothing rises above the level of an

1415
01:08:46,975 --> 01:08:47,487
Insinuation

1416
01:08:47,743 --> 01:08:49,023
And yet here we have Alex Jones

1417
01:08:49,279 --> 01:08:50,815
Reporting on his show that there were crazy

1418
01:08:51,839 --> 01:08:53,119
At the Aurora shooting

1419
01:08:54,143 --> 01:08:57,215
I think of his highlights and under-recognized aspect of Alberta

1420
01:08:57,471 --> 01:08:57,983
Is propaganda

1421
01:08:58,495 --> 01:08:59,007
He needs

1422
01:08:59,263 --> 01:08:59,775
To use crutches

1423
01:09:01,055 --> 01:09:03,103
You just can't say that the victims of Sandy

1424
01:09:03,359 --> 01:09:03,871
Hooker actor

1425
01:09:04,383 --> 01:09:05,151
Because

1426
01:09:09,503 --> 01:09:10,015
Parents

1427
01:09:10,527 --> 01:09:13,087
He knows that the accusations are based in reality

1428
01:09:13,343 --> 01:09:15,647
That level of b*******

1429
01:09:15,903 --> 01:09:16,927
Human level of Cruelty

1430
01:09:17,695 --> 01:09:21,023
In order to justify that leap he needs her to be another event where it's at

1431
01:09:22,047 --> 01:09:22,815
The crisis actors

1432
01:09:23,071 --> 01:09:23,839
Reusable shooting

1433
01:09:24,095 --> 01:09:26,655
Unless it's sensible to assume that they might have been

1434
01:09:26,911 --> 01:09:27,935
Sandy Hook as well

1435
01:09:28,703 --> 01:09:30,751
We saw him do this from the beginning with sand

1436
01:09:31,007 --> 01:09:33,567
Hook but surrounding the question of whether or not it was a false

1437
01:09:33,823 --> 01:09:34,335
Flag

1438
01:09:34,591 --> 01:09:37,407
He justified arguing that the globalist probably did say

1439
01:09:37,663 --> 01:09:39,967
Sandy Hook

1440
01:09:40,223 --> 01:09:42,527
Rahsaan constantly use that as his

1441
01:09:47,903 --> 01:09:52,511
He did that one that they did that it's likely they did this

1442
01:09:53,791 --> 01:09:57,119
He established to normalize that rhetoric and now it's perfectly acceptable

1443
01:09:57,375 --> 01:09:58,399
For him to apply that's

1444
01:10:01,983 --> 01:10:05,055
Thing is that he hasn't established in the past that actors were used in Aurora

1445
01:10:05,567 --> 01:10:06,335
That's new

1446
01:10:06,847 --> 01:10:11,711
He's trying to rewrite the narrative about Aurora to include that element in order to justify saying

1447
01:10:11,967 --> 01:10:12,735
The director is

1448
01:10:13,247 --> 01:10:13,759
Sandy Hook shooting

1449
01:10:14,015 --> 01:10:15,039
Which I feel he's

1450
01:10:15,295 --> 01:10:16,063
Very close

1451
01:10:16,831 --> 01:10:17,343
Yeah

1452
01:10:17,599 --> 01:10:18,111
This is

1453
01:10:18,367 --> 01:10:19,391
This is important

1454
01:10:19,647 --> 01:10:20,159
Like these are

1455
01:10:20,415 --> 01:10:21,439
Trends that are happening

1456
01:10:21,951 --> 01:10:22,719
And this is not

1457
01:10:23,487 --> 01:10:25,023
Like because we haven't listened

1458
01:10:25,279 --> 01:10:26,559
All these episodes

1459
01:10:29,631 --> 01:10:32,447
Would you say cuz to me this sounds like outside in

1460
01:10:33,215 --> 01:10:33,727
Changing

1461
01:10:33,983 --> 01:10:38,079
Yeah if that's the problem that's what it sounds like to me it sounds to me like he's

1462
01:10:38,335 --> 01:10:38,847
Buying his own

1463
01:10:39,103 --> 01:10:41,151
Conspiracy b******* from elsewhere

1464
01:10:41,663 --> 01:10:44,223
You know what I'm saying

1465
01:10:44,479 --> 01:10:48,319
Internal right

1466
01:10:48,575 --> 01:10:50,111
A couple of days ago I

1467
01:10:50,367 --> 01:10:50,879
Right now he

1468
01:10:52,159 --> 01:10:55,487
Co-opting yeah it's an essential limitation of how we

1469
01:10:55,743 --> 01:10:56,255
Can

1470
01:10:56,511 --> 01:10:57,023
Study Island

1471
01:10:57,791 --> 01:10:58,815
It in that

1472
01:10:59,327 --> 01:11:01,375
We can see the stuff on his show

1473
01:11:01,887 --> 01:11:04,191
And we can see okay there's a change

1474
01:11:04,447 --> 01:11:09,823
Sitting here but it doesn't necessarily allow us unless he says on his show what he's doing

1475
01:11:10,079 --> 01:11:13,151
Can't really Noah

1476
01:11:14,175 --> 01:11:14,687
Cause

1477
01:11:15,199 --> 01:11:16,735
This possibly behind this

1478
01:11:19,295 --> 01:11:22,623
And I think that's a limitation that it is appropriate for us to own up to

1479
01:11:23,391 --> 01:11:23,903
That

1480
01:11:24,159 --> 01:11:24,671
Said

1481
01:11:24,927 --> 01:11:26,719
He gets drunk and watches YouTube a lot

1482
01:11:27,231 --> 01:11:29,279
Possible

1483
01:11:29,535 --> 01:11:31,327
In the present day

1484
01:11:31,583 --> 01:11:32,095
Alex

1485
01:11:32,351 --> 01:11:34,911
Talking about the the crisis actor stuff

1486
01:11:35,167 --> 01:11:35,935
As it relates to

1487
01:11:36,191 --> 01:11:36,703
Sandy Hook

1488
01:11:36,959 --> 01:11:39,007
He will say the people like James

1489
01:11:39,263 --> 01:11:42,335
Tracy and Wolfgang halbig

1490
01:11:42,847 --> 01:11:43,615
Deemed credible

1491
01:11:44,639 --> 01:11:46,431
James Tracey was on the show Once

1492
01:11:46,687 --> 01:11:47,711
Paul Joseph Watson

1493
01:11:48,479 --> 01:11:52,063
Alex has not talked to him on the show

1494
01:11:52,319 --> 01:11:53,087
Not shown up

1495
01:11:53,343 --> 01:11:53,855
At all

1496
01:11:54,367 --> 01:11:57,439
Steve pieczenik even hasn't shown up on Alex's show

1497
01:11:57,695 --> 01:11:58,207
At all

1498
01:11:58,719 --> 01:11:59,487
There don't appear

1499
01:11:59,743 --> 01:12:00,767
YouTube Vianney

1500
01:12:01,023 --> 01:12:01,791
Influences

1501
01:12:02,303 --> 01:12:04,863
Outside of Alex's own mine

1502
01:12:05,119 --> 01:12:07,935
Yeah on his

1503
01:12:08,191 --> 01:12:08,703
This road

1504
01:12:09,215 --> 01:12:11,263
It seems entirely organic

1505
01:12:11,775 --> 01:12:16,127
If you are listening to his show

1506
01:12:16,383 --> 01:12:17,407
Those guys as being

1507
01:12:17,663 --> 01:12:18,687
People who gave him

1508
01:12:20,735 --> 01:12:22,015
It's entirely possible where

1509
01:12:22,527 --> 01:12:23,039
Considering that

1510
01:12:23,295 --> 01:12:24,063
Giving it to him

1511
01:12:25,087 --> 01:12:26,623
As opposed to him just watching some

1512
01:12:26,879 --> 01:12:30,463
I think they were on 100%

1513
01:12:30,719 --> 01:12:31,487
Some bad information

1514
01:12:32,767 --> 01:12:35,583
It could be him taking it from watching their s***

1515
01:12:36,351 --> 01:12:36,863
That is false

1516
01:12:37,887 --> 01:12:39,167
The other possibility

1517
01:12:39,423 --> 01:12:39,935
Is

1518
01:12:40,447 --> 01:12:43,007
That there are exchanges going on

1519
01:12:43,263 --> 01:12:44,799
Through email

1520
01:12:45,311 --> 01:12:47,103
And that's one of the things that I think is really

1521
01:12:47,359 --> 01:12:49,151
Important about the Sandy Hook lawsuits

1522
01:12:49,407 --> 01:12:49,919
That are happening

1523
01:12:50,175 --> 01:12:50,943
Is some of that key

1524
01:12:51,199 --> 01:12:51,711
Can come to light

1525
01:12:51,967 --> 01:12:54,015
Through discovery

1526
01:12:55,551 --> 01:12:56,063
The parrots

1527
01:12:56,319 --> 01:12:57,087
People suing Alex

1528
01:12:57,599 --> 01:12:58,367
I have requested

1529
01:12:59,135 --> 01:13:00,671
I think that a lot of it information

1530
01:13:00,927 --> 01:13:01,439
Is best

1531
01:13:01,695 --> 01:13:03,231
Served being investigated

1532
01:13:03,487 --> 01:13:04,255
And that

1533
01:13:04,511 --> 01:13:07,839
Contact information is available I am going

1534
01:13:08,863 --> 01:13:09,887
Chop it all up

1535
01:13:14,239 --> 01:13:15,263
So simple as that

1536
01:13:16,287 --> 01:13:16,799
A quick

1537
01:13:17,055 --> 01:13:17,823
Find search of

1538
01:13:19,103 --> 01:13:22,687
Hey how do you want to lie about Sandy Hook

1539
01:13:23,199 --> 01:13:23,711
Slugga themes

1540
01:13:24,735 --> 01:13:25,759
It's very possible

1541
01:13:26,015 --> 01:13:27,295
Seems very

1542
01:13:27,807 --> 01:13:29,343
Possible plausible

1543
01:13:29,855 --> 01:13:30,367
I have nothing

1544
01:13:30,623 --> 01:13:31,391
To back it up,

1545
01:13:31,647 --> 01:13:32,159
Concretely

1546
01:13:32,927 --> 01:13:33,439
Themes

1547
01:13:35,743 --> 01:13:38,815
It doesn't seem that crazy to assume that something is going on

1548
01:13:39,839 --> 01:13:40,863
At this point

1549
01:13:41,119 --> 01:13:42,399
Because this is a massive

1550
01:13:42,655 --> 01:13:43,423
Massive change

1551
01:13:43,679 --> 01:13:45,727
Right I don't know if like

1552
01:13:46,239 --> 01:13:47,263
The day of

1553
01:13:47,775 --> 01:13:48,543
The

1554
01:13:48,799 --> 01:13:49,567
Aurora shooting

1555
01:13:49,823 --> 01:13:51,103
Alex said there were actors

1556
01:13:51,615 --> 01:13:52,639
But I'd listen to Mom

1557
01:13:52,895 --> 01:13:53,663
Of his show

1558
01:13:53,919 --> 01:13:54,687
And it is not

1559
01:13:55,199 --> 01:13:55,967
He has ever

1560
01:13:56,479 --> 01:13:57,247
Applied

1561
01:13:57,503 --> 01:13:58,015
In that

1562
01:13:59,295 --> 01:14:01,343
It's been the other stuff the DARPA right

1563
01:14:01,599 --> 01:14:07,231
All all the other the Mind controls Antonio Airforce doctor notebook

1564
01:14:09,791 --> 01:14:10,303
Ryan rental

1565
01:14:11,327 --> 01:14:12,351
Now been on

1566
01:14:12,607 --> 01:14:13,119
Conspiracies

1567
01:14:13,375 --> 01:14:13,887
Hasn't

1568
01:14:14,911 --> 01:14:16,191
So why do you have that

1569
01:14:16,447 --> 01:14:17,471
You have the

1570
01:14:17,727 --> 01:14:18,239
The Chase

1571
01:14:18,751 --> 01:14:20,543
Interview is now an act

1572
01:14:21,567 --> 01:14:23,871
You're running into a good bit of

1573
01:14:24,639 --> 01:14:25,151
That

1574
01:14:25,407 --> 01:14:25,919
Becoming a

1575
01:14:27,455 --> 01:14:28,479
Rhetoric

1576
01:14:28,735 --> 01:14:29,247
Pushed

1577
01:14:29,759 --> 01:14:30,783
It feels like an intentional

1578
01:14:31,039 --> 01:14:32,063
Push here on this March 9th

1579
01:14:32,575 --> 01:14:33,087
Episode

1580
01:14:33,599 --> 01:14:35,391
I don't know what to make of it but I guess we'll see

1581
01:14:35,647 --> 01:14:38,463
At the same time it could just be

1582
01:14:39,231 --> 01:14:41,023
Alex

1583
01:14:41,535 --> 01:14:43,327
Could be he was watching a movie

1584
01:14:44,607 --> 01:14:46,655
A week ago where there were

1585
01:14:47,935 --> 01:14:48,959
What movie is this

1586
01:14:50,239 --> 01:14:52,031
Pick a pick a false flag

1587
01:14:52,287 --> 01:14:54,847
Okay

1588
01:14:55,359 --> 01:14:57,407
But it goes through the end

1589
01:14:57,663 --> 01:14:58,175
Fixated

1590
01:14:58,431 --> 01:14:59,455
Sprain

1591
01:14:59,711 --> 01:15:00,223
Fazos

1592
01:15:00,479 --> 01:15:00,991
Everything is

1593
01:15:02,015 --> 01:15:04,319
But I don't think so

1594
01:15:05,087 --> 01:15:06,367
It feels much more intense

1595
01:15:08,415 --> 01:15:09,951
I don't know how much

1596
01:15:10,207 --> 01:15:11,487
The planned editorial decision

1597
01:15:11,999 --> 01:15:13,791
As much as the day is like well

1598
01:15:14,047 --> 01:15:14,559
Moving in

1599
01:15:14,815 --> 01:15:15,327
Misdirection

1600
01:15:15,839 --> 01:15:18,399
I don't know I don't know we'll see how it develops

1601
01:15:19,423 --> 01:15:22,495
Episode Alex has an interview with someone who

1602
01:15:22,751 --> 01:15:24,031
We've never heard

1603
01:15:24,543 --> 01:15:25,055
From

1604
01:15:25,311 --> 01:15:25,823
Before

1605
01:15:26,591 --> 01:15:27,615
The guy named Cody Wilson

1606
01:15:28,383 --> 01:15:30,943
And has really excited about

1607
01:15:31,199 --> 01:15:31,967
Because he is

1608
01:15:32,223 --> 01:15:34,271
On the Forefront of 3D printing

1609
01:15:34,783 --> 01:15:37,599
Particularly in the area of printing gun

1610
01:15:37,855 --> 01:15:39,391
Okay well there was there's the bad

1611
01:15:39,903 --> 01:15:42,463
He is a guy who

1612
01:15:42,719 --> 01:15:43,743
To tell you is an anarchy

1613
01:15:44,255 --> 01:15:45,791
I believe that the best way to

1614
01:15:46,047 --> 01:15:46,559
To deteriorate

1615
01:15:46,815 --> 01:15:47,583
Power of the state

1616
01:15:48,095 --> 01:15:48,607
Is 2

1617
01:15:48,863 --> 01:15:49,887
To make it so everybody

1618
01:15:50,143 --> 01:15:50,655
Can have gun

1619
01:15:51,167 --> 01:15:52,703
He even acknowledges how

1620
01:15:52,959 --> 01:15:55,007
So incredibly f***** up this would be

1621
01:15:55,263 --> 01:15:56,543
Because you have completely

1622
01:15:56,799 --> 01:15:58,847
Undetectable

1623
01:15:59,103 --> 01:16:05,247
It doesn't seem to care too much about that it's like he's into chaos

1624
01:16:05,503 --> 01:16:06,527
Blueprints online

1625
01:16:06,783 --> 01:16:11,903
Infrared

1626
01:16:12,159 --> 01:16:17,791
Also stuff

1627
01:16:18,047 --> 01:16:18,559
Discussing

1628
01:16:18,815 --> 01:16:19,839
Sing house

1629
01:16:20,351 --> 01:16:20,863
Be ubiquitous

1630
01:16:21,119 --> 01:16:22,655
Sure that will be the solution

1631
01:16:22,911 --> 01:16:24,191
To all the world's problems

1632
01:16:38,527 --> 01:16:41,599
Especially with the gun part since we have a printable firearm

1633
01:16:45,695 --> 01:16:46,207
And this is why

1634
01:16:50,559 --> 01:16:53,119
This is important no one can take those things

1635
01:16:53,631 --> 01:16:54,399
They're online forever

1636
01:17:02,591 --> 01:17:03,871
I don't know

1637
01:17:04,127 --> 01:17:05,919
Should be thrilled of Anarchy

1638
01:17:06,175 --> 01:17:07,967
I really think

1639
01:17:08,479 --> 01:17:09,503
He's

1640
01:17:09,759 --> 01:17:11,807
A supervillain

1641
01:17:12,319 --> 01:17:14,111
I'm really loving everything you're doing so far

1642
01:17:14,367 --> 01:17:14,879
Yeah

1643
01:17:15,135 --> 01:17:16,159
He just falls in love with

1644
01:17:16,415 --> 01:17:17,439
This dude on this episode

1645
01:17:17,695 --> 01:17:21,791
Cody Wilson

1646
01:17:22,303 --> 01:17:27,935
Wilson has been working with 3D printing and unable to print a functional gun

1647
01:17:28,191 --> 01:17:31,519
Which he was doing to demonstrate the gun laws are pointless

1648
01:17:32,287 --> 01:17:34,335
Is it now or undetectable gun

1649
01:17:34,591 --> 01:17:36,127
Pretty much everywhere

1650
01:17:36,383 --> 01:17:37,407
There be no point in the state

1651
01:17:37,663 --> 01:17:38,943
Trying to control their flow

1652
01:17:39,199 --> 01:17:39,967
Andros Island

1653
01:17:40,223 --> 01:17:43,039
Fantasy nightmare of everyone walking around armed to the teeth

1654
01:17:43,295 --> 01:17:44,063
You coming to reality

1655
01:17:44,319 --> 01:17:45,343
This is the Phantom

1656
01:17:45,855 --> 01:17:46,623
If they're put in for

1657
01:17:51,487 --> 01:17:53,279
He says as much in the interview and he's against

1658
01:17:53,535 --> 01:17:56,607
The state completely which Alex should not be on board with

1659
01:17:57,375 --> 01:18:02,239
Everything he loves about the quote-unquote West

1660
01:18:02,495 --> 01:18:03,775
Completely disappear

1661
01:18:04,287 --> 01:18:05,567
But Cody super indigent

1662
01:18:05,823 --> 01:18:07,615
Then maybe the solution to gun regulation

1663
01:18:07,871 --> 01:18:08,895
Alex just skips over

1664
01:18:09,151 --> 01:18:09,663
That part

1665
01:18:09,919 --> 01:18:10,431
11

1666
01:18:11,455 --> 01:18:17,599
It's probably worth mentioning that in 2017 Cody well say Wilson would go on to launch the patreon alternative

1667
01:18:17,855 --> 01:18:23,231
Which was specifically designed to be a place where white supremacist and kicked off patreon

1668
01:18:24,767 --> 01:18:28,607
Because of his platform Richard Spencer was able to pull in a monthly income

1669
01:18:28,863 --> 01:18:34,495
And Andrew Anglin of the daily Stormer was able to raise his income by about $8,000 a month

1670
01:18:34,751 --> 01:18:35,519
A mad that

1671
01:18:35,775 --> 01:18:37,311
Podcaster in audiobook

1672
01:18:37,567 --> 01:18:41,663
Media because the Gorillaz

1673
01:18:41,919 --> 01:18:48,063
Spectacular rankings of top earners from their early time and

1674
01:18:48,319 --> 01:18:50,111
Existence

1675
01:18:50,367 --> 01:18:50,879
4

1676
01:18:51,135 --> 01:18:57,279
Why it's denoted Justin white supremacist organization identity evropa number 9 is

1677
01:18:57,535 --> 01:19:00,607
The guy who hosted the show fash the nation

1678
01:19:00,863 --> 01:19:04,191
You would probably guess it is the worst David Letterman top 10 in

1679
01:19:04,959 --> 01:19:09,055
Number 13 is Christopher Cantwell the crying Nazi from the unite the right rally

1680
01:19:09,567 --> 01:19:11,103
Number 14 is.

1681
01:19:11,359 --> 01:19:12,639
The founder of Stormfront

1682
01:19:13,407 --> 01:19:15,455
Looking through the list I really don't

1683
01:19:15,711 --> 01:19:16,223
Know if you can

1684
01:19:16,479 --> 01:19:17,759
Can find anyone with a razor

1685
01:19:18,015 --> 01:19:21,343
Fascist propaganda

1686
01:19:21,599 --> 01:19:22,623
Polly tied to white supremacy

1687
01:19:22,879 --> 01:19:23,391
Violence in

1688
01:19:23,903 --> 01:19:24,415
Last few years

1689
01:19:24,927 --> 01:19:25,695
I make no mistake

1690
01:19:26,463 --> 01:19:28,767
Initially hatreon was a service that

1691
01:19:29,023 --> 01:19:31,327
Creators could only set up accounts for buy-in

1692
01:19:32,351 --> 01:19:33,119
Cody Wilson

1693
01:19:33,375 --> 01:19:33,887
Specifically

1694
01:19:34,143 --> 01:19:34,655
Chose these

1695
01:19:36,191 --> 01:19:39,519
Patreon sold itself as the censorship free version of patreon

1696
01:19:39,775 --> 01:19:41,823
You can easily see what that means in practice

1697
01:19:42,591 --> 01:19:46,175
In concept you're imagining that it'll be a place where the free exchange of ideas

1698
01:19:46,431 --> 01:19:47,455
Can take place and everybody could be

1699
01:19:47,711 --> 01:19:53,343
Be themselves

1700
01:19:53,599 --> 01:19:56,159
Yep and reality to send up at the place where White

1701
01:19:56,671 --> 01:19:57,439
Confound their operation

1702
01:19:57,951 --> 01:19:59,231
Cody Wilson gets to take his

1703
01:19:59,487 --> 01:20:00,255
Cut off the top

1704
01:20:01,279 --> 01:20:03,071
Naturally because this is just

1705
01:20:03,327 --> 01:20:05,631
Literally a conduit for people to fund hatefi

1706
01:20:05,887 --> 01:20:07,423
Beach Pizza terminated their involved

1707
01:20:07,679 --> 01:20:09,215
But with the site is payment processor

1708
01:20:09,471 --> 01:20:11,263
There weren't any other option

1709
01:20:11,519 --> 01:20:13,055
Life for them to try cuz I'm place

1710
01:20:13,311 --> 01:20:13,824
Extra

1711
01:20:14,336 --> 01:20:15,360
PayPal it already

1712
01:20:15,616 --> 01:20:17,152
He kicked all these other costs

1713
01:20:17,664 --> 01:20:23,808
List all part of that point

1714
01:20:24,064 --> 01:20:26,368
You see all these right-wing guys

1715
01:20:26,624 --> 01:20:29,696
Iran has a good model of

1716
01:20:30,208 --> 01:20:30,720
A little off the top

1717
01:20:31,232 --> 01:20:33,536
It's not that hard for me to Cota website

1718
01:20:33,792 --> 01:20:34,816
B o of course

1719
01:20:35,584 --> 01:20:40,448
It's a good graft if you are willing to just make money off funding

1720
01:20:45,824 --> 01:20:46,336
Advantage storage

1721
01:20:48,128 --> 01:20:48,640
Good morning

1722
01:20:48,896 --> 01:20:50,176
For being a psychopath grift

1723
01:20:50,688 --> 01:20:54,528
Also in December 2018 Cody Wilson was indicted by the state of Texas

1724
01:20:58,880 --> 01:21:00,928
And indecency with a child by exposure

1725
01:21:01,696 --> 01:21:02,208
Get medicine

1726
01:21:02,720 --> 01:21:07,072
10 year old girl on a sugar daddy website

1727
01:21:07,584 --> 01:21:08,352
Very illegal

1728
01:21:08,608 --> 01:21:09,632
That's the most illegal

1729
01:21:09,888 --> 01:21:15,776
What do you sound out the police were looking into me allegedly fled to Taiwan but was ultimately returned back to the

1730
01:21:16,288 --> 01:21:16,800
I'd state

1731
01:21:17,312 --> 01:21:21,920
His defense argued that the child had lied about her age and Austin Police Commander said quote

1732
01:21:22,432 --> 01:21:27,552
Detectives have interviewed and spoken with his victim and then their opinion of someone mistakes her age

1733
01:21:28,064 --> 01:21:29,344
She's younger not older than

1734
01:21:29,856 --> 01:21:33,440
These are all that she is this gross

1735
01:21:34,208 --> 01:21:36,512
Even if she had misled Cody about her age

1736
01:21:36,768 --> 01:21:38,304
Texas law requires the adult

1737
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:40,096
To confirm that someone is above the age of

1738
01:21:40,352 --> 01:21:42,912
You can set and put to no legal burden on a child victim

1739
01:21:43,168 --> 01:21:44,448
Which I think is probably the best way for

1740
01:21:44,960 --> 01:21:49,568
Listen to operate as the alternate yeah that would be a really good way

1741
01:21:50,336 --> 01:21:52,128
So Cody ended up leading down ascend

1742
01:21:52,384 --> 01:21:53,664
But I was still sentence

1743
01:21:53,920 --> 01:21:56,224
27 years probation and had to register as a sex offender

1744
01:21:57,248 --> 01:21:58,784
He's not allowed to be alone with minors

1745
01:21:59,040 --> 01:22:00,832
Nana possible poetic irony

1746
01:22:01,344 --> 01:22:02,368
He's not allowed to own firearm

1747
01:22:02,624 --> 01:22:03,392
Anymore

1748
01:22:05,184 --> 01:22:06,720
So these are the sorts of people

1749
01:22:08,768 --> 01:22:09,536
Who's got

1750
01:22:09,792 --> 01:22:10,560
Hanging around

1751
01:22:13,120 --> 01:22:15,168
Kind of

1752
01:22:15,424 --> 01:22:16,192
About Cody Welch

1753
01:22:16,448 --> 01:22:20,544
Alex Jones

1754
01:22:21,312 --> 01:22:22,848
This clip takes on a

1755
01:22:23,104 --> 01:22:23,616
Slightly

1756
01:22:29,248 --> 01:22:31,296
Technology

1757
01:22:31,552 --> 01:22:34,880
This is from

1758
01:22:53,824 --> 01:22:55,360
The old way of thinking

1759
01:22:55,872 --> 01:23:02,016
Relishing in this idea that people think they're f*****-up dangerous people

1760
01:23:02,272 --> 01:23:04,064
It's one of those things like you look back at this

1761
01:23:04,320 --> 01:23:05,088
6 years in the past

1762
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:09,696
And you have to ask the question I would love to like show that would be like

1763
01:23:10,208 --> 01:23:12,000
Maybe everyone was right

1764
01:23:13,536 --> 01:23:14,304
Absolutely

1765
01:23:14,560 --> 01:23:18,400
Whatever

1766
01:23:18,656 --> 01:23:19,168
Together in the

1767
01:23:20,704 --> 01:23:21,984
Jerking each other off for being

1768
01:23:22,240 --> 01:23:22,752
Soda

1769
01:23:23,008 --> 01:23:24,544
That's cuz you're not

1770
01:23:24,800 --> 01:23:27,104
You're living this fantasy where we like

1771
01:23:27,360 --> 01:23:28,896
Cody Wilson is living this weird

1772
01:23:29,152 --> 01:23:30,176
Super villain fan

1773
01:23:30,688 --> 01:23:35,808
Like he's living like if I make guns available for everyone that all power is meaningless

1774
01:23:36,064 --> 01:23:36,832
Is doing that all thing

1775
01:23:40,672 --> 01:23:42,976
So powerful in the

1776
01:23:43,744 --> 01:23:44,768
Realm or whatever it is

1777
01:23:46,816 --> 01:23:47,584
Conforth been like

1778
01:23:47,840 --> 01:23:50,144
You're great. You're a great because we're both so

1779
01:23:50,400 --> 01:23:50,912
Scary

1780
01:23:51,168 --> 01:23:52,192
Powerful

1781
01:23:52,448 --> 01:23:57,056
I'm a threat to the system

1782
01:23:57,312 --> 01:24:00,896
Translate more to I'm a threat to peace

1783
01:24:03,712 --> 01:24:07,808
Because I was not treated as one when I was nine or whatever the f***

1784
01:24:08,064 --> 01:24:08,832
Psychology it is

1785
01:24:10,112 --> 01:24:13,440
He also is a big booster of Bitcoin

1786
01:24:13,952 --> 01:24:14,464
And he's

1787
01:24:14,720 --> 01:24:17,536
Specifically trying to promote bitcoin-based

1788
01:24:17,792 --> 01:24:20,352
I assume he got very very very rich

1789
01:24:21,120 --> 01:24:23,424
I mean I bet he was pretty rich to begin with

1790
01:24:23,680 --> 01:24:26,496
He had a lot of people interested in the

1791
01:24:27,008 --> 01:24:28,032
Like it cuz a month

1792
01:24:29,568 --> 01:24:30,336
2 months after this

1793
01:24:30,592 --> 01:24:31,104
He does make you

1794
01:24:31,360 --> 01:24:32,384
Huge Splash by

1795
01:24:32,640 --> 01:24:34,176
Having a 3D printed

1796
01:24:34,432 --> 01:24:39,296
I recall almost

1797
01:24:39,552 --> 01:24:42,112
And so like there were a bunch of people funding

1798
01:24:42,624 --> 01:24:43,904
With with capital

1799
01:24:46,464 --> 01:24:47,488
Make a lot of money

1800
01:24:51,328 --> 01:24:54,144
But in this club by he's trying to promote bitcoin-based

1801
01:24:54,912 --> 01:24:55,936
Coinbase

1802
01:24:56,192 --> 01:24:58,240
Exactly

1803
01:24:58,496 --> 01:25:02,592
Whatever it is Alex is always very suspicious about

1804
01:25:05,408 --> 01:25:07,712
It's interesting the way you suspicious about it

1805
01:25:13,344 --> 01:25:16,928
It's just one of the easiest way to buy and sell Bitcoin and accessible

1806
01:25:25,376 --> 01:25:30,752
People that think like him people with that sounds fun mentality corporations

1807
01:25:32,288 --> 01:25:33,056
Companies like coins

1808
01:25:41,504 --> 01:25:43,040
Self

1809
01:25:43,296 --> 01:25:44,064
Well I mean

1810
01:25:46,880 --> 01:25:47,392
So

1811
01:25:47,648 --> 01:25:51,744
Itsfunneh do your Alex still worried about Peter Thiel back in 2013

1812
01:25:52,512 --> 01:25:55,072
He suspicious about Bitcoin as a free and open Marketplace

1813
01:25:55,840 --> 01:25:58,912
The only real specific he gives him his interviews that he believes Peter Tila

1814
01:25:59,168 --> 01:25:59,680
Involved

1815
01:25:59,936 --> 01:26:03,264
Is a bit of a red flag

1816
01:26:03,776 --> 01:26:09,920
In October 26th New York Times reported the team donated $1000000 to Trump's presidential campaign

1817
01:26:10,176 --> 01:26:12,736
And not surprisingly wasn't important advisor

1818
01:26:14,528 --> 01:26:15,040
After the election

1819
01:26:15,552 --> 01:26:18,880
By that point in continuing to the present Alex has been a strong

1820
01:26:19,136 --> 01:26:19,648
People advocate

1821
01:26:20,160 --> 01:26:21,184
Which is also

1822
01:26:21,696 --> 01:26:25,024
Covert

1823
01:26:25,536 --> 01:26:29,888
I don't think it'll happen to buy 2013

1824
01:26:30,400 --> 01:26:36,032
Cuz the only thing I recall, in lawsuit

1825
01:26:36,288 --> 01:26:37,312
This point is the first

1826
01:26:37,568 --> 01:26:42,432
Founder of Facebook

1827
01:26:42,688 --> 01:26:45,760
Cease and desist you any journalistic outlet that

1828
01:26:46,016 --> 01:26:46,528
Said his name

1829
01:26:46,784 --> 01:26:48,832
Haha

1830
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:50,112
Jennifer Alex

1831
01:26:50,368 --> 01:26:51,392
Like those trifecta

1832
01:26:51,648 --> 01:26:52,672
Being

1833
01:26:53,184 --> 01:26:53,696
Facebook

1834
01:26:53,952 --> 01:26:54,464
Evil global

1835
01:26:55,232 --> 01:26:56,256
Alex's on that tip

1836
01:26:58,560 --> 01:26:59,072
I'm not sure

1837
01:26:59,328 --> 01:27:00,096
I'm not sure what he hate

1838
01:27:00,352 --> 01:27:02,656
Puppy tortilla palantir is still Bowl

1839
01:27:02,912 --> 01:27:03,424
Yvette's

1840
01:27:03,680 --> 01:27:04,448
Vets around

1841
01:27:04,704 --> 01:27:06,496
Right I don't know exactly Alex's

1842
01:27:07,008 --> 01:27:09,824
But right

1843
01:27:10,848 --> 01:27:12,384
Fuckum

1844
01:27:13,152 --> 01:27:14,688
And

1845
01:27:14,944 --> 01:27:15,456
What something really good

1846
01:27:16,224 --> 01:27:20,320
Because in 2015 when we were looking at that. Of time where Alex

1847
01:27:20,576 --> 01:27:21,344
Makes peace with

1848
01:27:22,368 --> 01:27:23,136
And besides just boarded

1849
01:27:25,184 --> 01:27:25,952
It was in the back

1850
01:27:26,464 --> 01:27:27,232
Did we discover

1851
01:27:27,488 --> 01:27:28,256
Was that Alex

1852
01:27:28,512 --> 01:27:29,024
Love Rush

1853
01:27:29,536 --> 01:27:30,304
Right

1854
01:27:30,560 --> 01:27:31,328
There

1855
01:27:32,352 --> 01:27:32,864
Was

1856
01:27:33,120 --> 01:27:34,144
Perhaps some

1857
01:27:35,424 --> 01:27:35,936
Suspicion or some

1858
01:27:36,192 --> 01:27:37,216
Feelings

1859
01:27:37,472 --> 01:27:42,080
When we initially started looking at it that these two things were related and so

1860
01:27:42,336 --> 01:27:46,176
As we learned more

1861
01:27:46,432 --> 01:27:51,040
Love Putin and Russia

1862
01:27:51,296 --> 01:27:54,624
Almost entirely disconnected

1863
01:27:54,880 --> 01:27:55,648
Did from his path

1864
01:27:56,672 --> 01:27:57,184
Supporting Trump

1865
01:27:57,440 --> 01:28:01,792
Yeah it just existed already before

1866
01:28:02,048 --> 01:28:06,400
He started as opposed to drop Ricky wheeler you tomorrow

1867
01:28:06,656 --> 01:28:07,680
Cunningham loving Russia

1868
01:28:08,192 --> 01:28:11,520
Absolutely

1869
01:28:11,776 --> 01:28:12,288
Indication

1870
01:28:12,544 --> 01:28:13,312
Of

1871
01:28:14,592 --> 01:28:15,872
Russo positive

Worldview

1873
01:28:18,176 --> 01:28:19,456
Taking Russia's line

1874
01:28:19,712 --> 01:28:20,224
On

1875
01:28:21,248 --> 01:28:23,552
Certain geopolitical issues

1876
01:28:23,808 --> 01:28:26,880
To question about who's is correct

1877
01:28:27,136 --> 01:28:29,184
What is interest

1878
01:28:29,440 --> 01:28:30,208
Is that in twenty

1879
01:28:31,744 --> 01:28:32,512
Pictures of Alex's

1880
01:28:33,280 --> 01:28:33,792
Positive

1881
01:28:34,048 --> 01:28:34,560
Russia

1882
01:28:34,816 --> 01:28:35,840
Angle was

1883
01:28:36,096 --> 01:28:37,632
That Putin kicked out the oligarch

1884
01:28:38,144 --> 01:28:39,936
And the poop

1885
01:28:40,192 --> 01:28:46,336
Putin is trying to create this wonderful Christian free-market whatever

1886
01:28:46,592 --> 01:28:48,896
Complete and total coincidence that that journalist died

1887
01:28:49,408 --> 01:28:51,712
State was murdered on the same day

1888
01:28:52,224 --> 01:28:54,016
Leave out of sight

1889
01:28:54,784 --> 01:28:56,320
Alex's video

1890
01:28:56,576 --> 01:28:58,112
Kicked out the oligarchs

1891
01:28:58,368 --> 01:28:59,136
That's one of the big

1892
01:28:59,648 --> 01:29:00,160
This is why

1893
01:29:00,416 --> 01:29:00,928
You love

1894
01:29:02,208 --> 01:29:02,720
Supports him

1895
01:29:38,048 --> 01:29:40,608
So he understands but they didn't kick out the oligarch

1896
01:29:41,632 --> 01:29:43,936
In 2013 no not in 2013

1897
01:29:49,824 --> 01:29:53,920
I don't I don't that's not even Alex's angle in 2050

1898
01:29:55,968 --> 01:30:00,064
Alright Alex

1899
01:30:00,320 --> 01:30:01,856
Alright Alex

1900
01:30:02,624 --> 01:30:03,392
Interesting I wonder what

1901
01:30:03,648 --> 01:30:08,256
I wondered what

1902
01:30:08,512 --> 01:30:09,280
Between 2013

1903
01:30:09,536 --> 01:30:11,328
2015

1904
01:30:11,584 --> 01:30:12,608
I wonder if it has anything

1905
01:30:12,864 --> 01:30:13,632
Things to do with Siri

1906
01:30:14,656 --> 01:30:16,192
I do I do wonder that

1907
01:30:19,264 --> 01:30:23,104
I don't believe so that was a

1908
01:30:25,920 --> 01:30:27,456
Except for I guess going on max

1909
01:30:27,712 --> 01:30:28,480
Kaiser show

1910
01:30:32,576 --> 01:30:33,600
I'm not sure Wilson

1911
01:30:35,136 --> 01:30:35,648
Because that's

1912
01:30:35,904 --> 01:30:37,184
Pocket incongruous

1913
01:30:37,440 --> 01:30:38,720
As hell yeah that's strange

1914
01:30:39,232 --> 01:30:42,560
Look at this clip in just for our our our dear friend Sonia

1915
01:30:43,584 --> 01:30:44,864
I think she will enjoy

1916
01:30:49,216 --> 01:30:49,728
Dumb clip

1917
01:30:58,944 --> 01:30:59,712
But

1918
01:30:59,968 --> 01:31:03,040
Hours of the north-south mountain

1919
01:31:07,648 --> 01:31:09,696
Europe

1920
01:31:09,952 --> 01:31:14,304
North America

1921
01:31:18,912 --> 01:31:19,424
Good stuff

1922
01:31:20,960 --> 01:31:21,728
We love it

1923
01:31:21,984 --> 01:31:26,336
Western Hemisphere

1924
01:31:26,592 --> 01:31:28,384
That's how you say those or something

1925
01:31:28,896 --> 01:31:30,688
Intersection of Alex Mack

1926
01:31:31,200 --> 01:31:32,736
A woman whose

1927
01:31:32,992 --> 01:31:34,784
Supported Obama

1928
01:31:35,040 --> 01:31:37,344
Gross Elliman

1929
01:31:39,904 --> 01:31:41,184
Bring it in I don't know why I'm

1930
01:31:42,976 --> 01:31:44,512
Just point out these

1931
01:31:45,024 --> 01:31:45,536
Shift

1932
01:31:53,728 --> 01:31:54,752
He's going to destroy

1933
01:32:04,480 --> 01:32:06,016
That is going to look

1934
01:32:13,952 --> 01:32:18,816
You will kill for Obama

1935
01:32:27,776 --> 01:32:29,824
Weather out there

1936
01:32:30,336 --> 01:32:30,848
Wow

1937
01:32:31,360 --> 01:32:34,432
Alex has many many times said that he would die for

1938
01:32:34,688 --> 01:32:35,968
It's

1939
01:32:37,504 --> 01:32:42,368
Ridiculous absolutely right

1940
01:32:43,136 --> 01:32:45,696
He's so smart about how people will get

1941
01:32:45,952 --> 01:32:48,256
Turned into an authoritarian Empire

1942
01:32:48,768 --> 01:32:49,536
Babe

1943
01:32:50,048 --> 01:32:50,560
Like almost

1944
01:32:50,816 --> 01:32:51,328
Gleefully

1945
01:32:51,840 --> 01:32:54,144
Joining it

1946
01:32:55,168 --> 01:32:58,240
I would be critical of anybody who says

1947
01:32:58,496 --> 01:33:03,616
They would die for their chosen political leader

1948
01:33:03,872 --> 01:33:06,432
Critical of Alexandra

1949
01:33:06,688 --> 01:33:07,200
Sentiment

1950
01:33:07,712 --> 01:33:12,320
The difference between me and Alex is Alex is not critical of his own sentiment of I would die for from

1951
01:33:13,088 --> 01:33:14,368
That is a problem

1952
01:33:14,624 --> 01:33:18,720
Very weird

1953
01:33:19,744 --> 01:33:21,280
Very clear that she's being

1954
01:33:22,816 --> 01:33:24,608
Will probably yeah or

1955
01:33:24,864 --> 01:33:31,008
Everybody's having it to Alex right now

1956
01:33:31,264 --> 01:33:32,800
Probably exaggerating

1957
01:33:33,056 --> 01:33:33,568
Of context

1958
01:33:33,824 --> 01:33:34,336
It's very

1959
01:33:35,360 --> 01:33:37,664
We're back to the chase glitch

1960
01:33:38,176 --> 01:33:40,480
Now Alex is covering that you're on the 20th

1961
01:33:40,992 --> 01:33:42,016
Amanda

1962
01:33:42,272 --> 01:33:42,784
Smells

1963
01:33:52,512 --> 01:33:53,280
0

1964
01:33:53,792 --> 01:33:55,840
People couldn't

1965
01:34:15,552 --> 01:34:18,112
This is based on

1966
01:34:18,368 --> 01:34:21,696
Conversations you probably never had with it people

1967
01:34:22,720 --> 01:34:25,536
Send one time. They said that that would probably never happen

1968
01:34:28,352 --> 01:34:29,632
Alex is creating this

1969
01:34:29,888 --> 01:34:32,192
Conspiracy surrounding this Chase glitch

1970
01:34:33,216 --> 01:34:34,496
In service of reinforcing

1971
01:34:35,264 --> 01:34:35,776
I guess

1972
01:34:36,288 --> 01:34:38,336
What probably is more primary is

1973
01:34:40,640 --> 01:34:41,408
Play become more primary

1974
01:34:41,920 --> 01:34:43,200
Is the idea that this guy

1975
01:34:43,968 --> 01:34:46,528
TV interview was an actor who was there too

1976
01:34:46,784 --> 01:34:49,856
Describe people from thinking it was any kind of nefarious

1977
01:34:51,648 --> 01:34:52,160
A map

1978
01:34:52,416 --> 01:34:54,208
Interesting

1979
01:34:54,464 --> 01:34:57,792
Incredibly impossible to hide ever

1980
01:34:58,816 --> 01:35:00,608
Conspiracy though that idea that

1981
01:35:00,864 --> 01:35:01,888
Some Bank like Chase

1982
01:35:02,656 --> 01:35:03,168
Wood

1983
01:35:03,680 --> 01:35:04,960
In a second

1984
01:35:05,984 --> 01:35:06,496
Flash second

1985
01:35:07,008 --> 01:35:09,312
Take all this money from all these

1986
01:35:10,080 --> 01:35:11,616
Invest it instantly

1987
01:35:11,872 --> 01:35:13,408
See the stock rise by one penny

1988
01:35:13,920 --> 01:35:14,432
And then

1989
01:35:15,456 --> 01:35:17,504
It take it all out after selling all those shares

1990
01:35:17,760 --> 01:35:19,552
And putting all of that money back

1991
01:35:19,808 --> 01:35:20,320
Into your

1992
01:35:21,088 --> 01:35:24,928
So they would make money and you wouldn't even notice cuz it all happens in a

1993
01:35:25,440 --> 01:35:26,208
That's a fun

1994
01:35:26,464 --> 01:35:32,096
Conspiracy theory that could be instantly and easily found out and would be the most illegal possible thing

1995
01:35:32,352 --> 01:35:33,376
That could ever f******

1996
01:35:33,888 --> 01:35:35,680
Alex not understand

1997
01:35:35,936 --> 01:35:37,472
It's work already

1998
01:35:41,824 --> 01:35:42,336
It's Melissa

1999
01:35:43,104 --> 01:35:43,616
So stupid

2000
01:35:47,968 --> 01:35:54,112
If you don't work all she is the lady who is super into agenda

2001
01:35:54,368 --> 01:35:55,136
Corrupt local meetings

2002
01:35:56,672 --> 01:35:57,952
Any kind of

2003
01:35:58,464 --> 01:36:01,280
Environmentalism any kind of Civic planning

2004
01:36:01,536 --> 01:36:02,304
Building Park

2005
01:36:02,560 --> 01:36:07,936
As being part of

2006
01:36:09,216 --> 01:36:11,264
Their interview is just exactly the

2007
01:36:11,776 --> 01:36:13,312
Same as the last time we talked about her it's

2008
01:36:13,568 --> 01:36:14,080
Not worth getting in

2009
01:36:14,336 --> 01:36:14,848
Into again

2010
01:36:15,104 --> 01:36:15,872
Except for this

2011
01:36:16,384 --> 01:36:16,896
Did she say

2012
01:36:17,408 --> 01:36:18,688
That Alex doesn't

2013
01:36:19,968 --> 01:36:23,296
Australia

2014
01:36:23,552 --> 01:36:24,832
Australia

2015
01:36:25,088 --> 01:36:31,232
It's terrible people are really dealing with it

2016
01:36:41,472 --> 01:36:45,568
Alex doesn't seem to be like

2017
01:36:45,824 --> 01:36:48,384
That's the sort of thing that should be

2018
01:36:48,640 --> 01:36:49,152
Like

2019
01:36:49,664 --> 01:36:53,248
Why would you go on that show they are explicitly

2020
01:36:53,504 --> 01:36:54,528
White supremacist

2021
01:36:55,040 --> 01:36:58,112
White nationalist show

2022
01:36:58,368 --> 01:37:01,696
Throws Good Morning America

2023
01:37:02,208 --> 01:37:04,000
Like we're in a very safe space

2024
01:37:04,768 --> 01:37:06,560
Speak freely Rosa

2025
01:37:08,864 --> 01:37:10,912
How old is

2026
01:37:11,168 --> 01:37:16,288
Just be like oh yeah I was also on this f****** show that is largely about identity

2027
01:37:17,568 --> 01:37:20,640
And it's cool

2028
01:37:20,896 --> 01:37:22,176
21 is a global problem

2029
01:37:22,432 --> 01:37:23,456
Yep great

2030
01:37:23,712 --> 01:37:25,248
Red Rosa

2031
01:37:27,808 --> 01:37:28,576
Hanover

2032
01:37:28,832 --> 01:37:29,344
Few days

2033
01:37:30,112 --> 01:37:32,416
Alex incorporate ideas of this

2034
01:37:32,928 --> 01:37:35,232
TV interview being an actor

2035
01:37:35,488 --> 01:37:36,256
We seen him

2036
01:37:36,512 --> 01:37:39,328
Save it some of the survivors and victims

2037
01:37:39,584 --> 01:37:41,120
The Aurora shooting where actors

2038
01:37:41,632 --> 01:37:43,424
Is

2039
01:37:43,680 --> 01:37:44,192
A

2040
01:37:44,960 --> 01:37:45,984
Three is a pattern

2041
01:37:46,752 --> 01:37:47,520
Here is the third

2042
01:37:53,408 --> 01:37:59,552
Directions

2043
01:38:07,744 --> 01:38:11,072
We should all that's US National Guard

2044
01:38:20,800 --> 01:38:23,616
Social Security authorized private security

2045
01:38:28,736 --> 01:38:31,552
Hung up on

2046
01:38:34,624 --> 01:38:40,768
Security number

2047
01:38:41,024 --> 01:38:43,328
I just called

2048
01:39:06,368 --> 01:39:09,696
Doesn't look concerned that

2049
01:39:10,208 --> 01:39:10,976
Reporter

2050
01:39:11,488 --> 01:39:17,376
22nd I apologize and clarify Alex and Mike Adams hosted

2051
01:39:19,424 --> 01:39:22,240
And he's coming in with this narrative

2052
01:39:22,496 --> 01:39:24,032
About G20

2053
01:39:24,800 --> 01:39:25,312
Psyop

2054
01:39:25,568 --> 01:39:26,080
Yeah

2055
01:39:27,104 --> 01:39:29,920
I don't believe Alex's story about how he got this in

2056
01:39:30,176 --> 01:39:30,944
Information for

2057
01:39:33,760 --> 01:39:36,832
Mainly that he always lies right

2058
01:39:37,088 --> 01:39:37,856
That is just

2059
01:39:38,368 --> 01:39:40,160
Unbelievable chain of events

2060
01:39:40,672 --> 01:39:43,488
You got your answer

2061
01:39:44,768 --> 01:39:46,816
Alex doesn't ever do investigative work

2062
01:39:47,072 --> 01:39:48,096
So the idea that you would

2063
01:39:48,352 --> 01:39:49,888
Track down other phone numbers

2064
01:39:50,144 --> 01:39:50,912
Is laughing

2065
01:39:51,936 --> 01:39:54,496
But like I said I'm trying to be pretty clear about the

2066
01:39:55,264 --> 01:39:57,312
I'm seeing a trend developing of Alex

2067
01:39:57,568 --> 01:40:00,896
Incorporating crisis actors it was narrative has not

2068
01:40:01,152 --> 01:40:01,664
Up till this point

2069
01:40:02,176 --> 01:40:05,760
I've been listening to every single minute of his show

2070
01:40:06,272 --> 01:40:09,088
I can say with no hesitation that this is not normal

2071
01:40:09,600 --> 01:40:11,648
We've already seen Alex at actors because

2072
01:40:11,904 --> 01:40:13,184
Conspiracy about the Aurora shooting

2073
01:40:13,696 --> 01:40:18,816
And now people arrested at the 2009 G20 meeting in Pittsburgh where actors engaged

2074
01:40:19,072 --> 01:40:20,352
Asiop run by the

2075
01:40:21,376 --> 01:40:23,168
Presumably at the behest of globalist

2076
01:40:23,424 --> 01:40:25,472
So they could gauge how the media would respond to

2077
01:40:26,752 --> 01:40:29,056
Let's leave aside for a moment how stupid this is

2078
01:40:29,312 --> 01:40:32,384
If you believe as Alex does that the globalist already

2079
01:40:32,640 --> 01:40:33,152
Control the media

2080
01:40:33,664 --> 01:40:36,992
What's more important is how Alex is missing out on a real in

2081
01:40:37,248 --> 01:40:38,272
Instance of State oppression

2082
01:40:38,784 --> 01:40:39,808
In service of using it

2083
01:40:40,064 --> 01:40:41,088
How to create a different

2084
01:40:41,600 --> 01:40:42,112
Pharisee

2085
01:40:42,880 --> 01:40:43,648
Auto rebates

2086
01:40:43,904 --> 01:40:45,440
Level its analysis best interest

2087
01:40:45,696 --> 01:40:46,464
The delegitimize

2088
01:40:46,720 --> 01:40:47,488
The G20 protests

2089
01:40:48,256 --> 01:40:52,352
He wants to yell about the G20 but the people who are actually protesting never largely anti

2090
01:40:52,608 --> 01:40:53,120
A capitalist

2091
01:40:53,632 --> 01:40:59,008
People who are willing to put their bodies on the line or not people who think three people voted in the Federal Reserve it takes

2092
01:40:59,776 --> 01:41:02,080
The people who want to dismantle the power of capital

2093
01:41:02,592 --> 01:41:03,872
That's a threat to the power struck

2094
01:41:04,128 --> 01:41:05,408
It's also a threat to Allie

2095
01:41:05,920 --> 01:41:07,968
So course you would have propaganda narrative

2096
01:41:08,224 --> 01:41:09,760
In order to delegitimize

2097
01:41:10,016 --> 01:41:10,528
Census of

2098
01:41:12,576 --> 01:41:15,136
That said even though it makes sense for him to undercut

2099
01:41:15,648 --> 01:41:16,416
Decapolis protest

2100
01:41:17,440 --> 01:41:19,232
I've never heard of argue this people arrested

2101
01:41:19,488 --> 01:41:20,256
2009

2102
01:41:20,512 --> 01:41:21,024
G20 meeting

2103
01:41:23,328 --> 01:41:23,840
Absolutely

2104
01:41:24,096 --> 01:41:24,608
We're not

2105
01:41:25,120 --> 01:41:28,960
The specific arrest Alex's talking about was the subject of his videos at

2106
01:41:29,216 --> 01:41:30,752
2009 viral

2107
01:41:31,008 --> 01:41:37,152
It was a video of a car pulling up on protesters camo coming out and grabbing a guy and tossing them into

2108
01:41:38,432 --> 01:41:40,736
Immediately the internet went wild the theories of

2109
01:41:40,992 --> 01:41:44,832
That the arrest was fake because we Campbell outfits the men were wearing

2110
01:41:45,344 --> 01:41:46,880
They were like a different form of

2111
01:41:47,136 --> 01:41:49,696
Camos and National

2112
01:41:51,744 --> 01:41:54,304
Sure

2113
01:41:54,816 --> 01:41:55,584
What's another

2114
01:42:01,472 --> 01:42:01,984
A comet

2115
01:42:02,240 --> 01:42:03,776
That's just not part of the Infowars journalism

2116
01:42:04,032 --> 01:42:05,056
In process

2117
01:42:05,312 --> 01:42:10,176
I can count on one hand the number of times I believe they may have sent someone an email to check on a story

2118
01:42:10,688 --> 01:42:16,320
What Alex is probably referring to as the boilerplate response that the information center

2119
01:42:16,576 --> 01:42:18,368
Journalist inquiring about the arrest

2120
01:42:19,392 --> 01:42:20,928
Found published verbatim on both

2121
01:42:21,184 --> 01:42:21,696
Mediaite

2122
01:42:21,952 --> 01:42:22,464
10 Raw Story

2123
01:42:23,232 --> 01:42:28,096
Jules involved 2409 arrest which has appeared online

2124
01:42:28,352 --> 01:42:30,656
Enforcement officers from a multi-agency

2125
01:42:30,912 --> 01:42:31,680
Tactical response

2126
01:42:32,448 --> 01:42:34,752
It's Not Unusual for tactical team members to

2127
01:42:35,008 --> 01:42:35,520
Wear camouflage

2128
01:42:36,544 --> 01:42:40,384
The type of fatigue fatigue the officers wear designates their unit affiliate

2129
01:42:41,408 --> 01:42:47,552
This is pretty close to what Alex is saying the Army told so I'm going to assume he probably just read this response inside

2130
01:42:48,576 --> 01:42:49,088
Reached out

2131
01:42:49,344 --> 01:42:51,136
To them himself knowing that the response

2132
01:42:52,160 --> 01:42:53,440
If you did reach out to its

2133
01:42:53,696 --> 01:42:54,976
2 safe

2134
01:42:56,256 --> 01:42:57,280
They reach out to him

2135
01:42:58,816 --> 01:42:59,328
Sure

2136
01:42:59,840 --> 01:43:01,376
These weren't military members

2137
01:43:01,632 --> 01:43:03,424
Despite their camo they were allegedly

2138
01:43:03,680 --> 01:43:09,568
Observe the individual

2139
01:43:10,080 --> 01:43:13,664
And decided to intervene the way they did do to the quote hostile nature of the

2140
01:43:13,920 --> 01:43:14,432
Krowd

2141
01:43:14,944 --> 01:43:16,224
I think that's all kind of b*******

2142
01:43:16,480 --> 01:43:17,760
And the rest absolutely

2143
01:43:18,272 --> 01:43:20,320
I would describe is overkill in the methods

2144
01:43:20,576 --> 01:43:21,088
They're using

2145
01:43:21,344 --> 01:43:23,648
But Alex doesn't help the actual problem

2146
01:43:26,720 --> 01:43:28,256
To file internal complaints

2147
01:43:28,512 --> 01:43:30,304
Wednesday is the victim

2148
01:43:30,560 --> 01:43:32,096
A police over-reach dozen

2149
01:43:32,352 --> 01:43:33,120
And help the problem

2150
01:43:33,376 --> 01:43:33,888
Right

2151
01:43:34,144 --> 01:43:34,912
Because he wants

2152
01:43:35,168 --> 01:43:35,936
He wants

2153
01:43:36,192 --> 01:43:37,728
Terrorist

2154
01:43:37,984 --> 01:43:38,496
Policing

2155
01:43:42,592 --> 01:43:45,152
The largest year for our purposes though is that this

2156
01:43:45,408 --> 01:43:46,432
Was a real rat

2157
01:43:47,456 --> 01:43:48,224
Zero evidence

2158
01:43:48,480 --> 01:43:50,528
Support his claim that he was an actor who was arrested

2159
01:43:50,784 --> 01:43:51,552
It is part of a psyop

2160
01:43:52,064 --> 01:43:55,392
That's a completely unfounded belief he's decided to presentist

2161
01:43:55,904 --> 01:43:57,952
And I believe it's part of a growing pattern

2162
01:43:58,464 --> 01:44:02,560
More and more things are being called fake and alleged to be evolving Act

2163
01:44:03,328 --> 01:44:05,376
This is the third example in a week

2164
01:44:05,632 --> 01:44:06,400
Weeks worth of Alex

2165
01:44:06,656 --> 01:44:07,168
Does program

2166
01:44:07,424 --> 01:44:08,960
And I don't think it means nothing

2167
01:44:09,984 --> 01:44:15,616
It's important to note to like I mentioned earlier that Alex has not had Wolfgang halbig on his show up to this point

2168
01:44:16,128 --> 01:44:18,432
He's at James Tracy on but Alex didn't even talk to

2169
01:44:19,200 --> 01:44:24,576
This like if this is in fact where we jump off the hook actors narrative

2170
01:44:25,344 --> 01:44:25,856
Alex

2171
01:44:26,624 --> 01:44:27,136
Really make it

2172
01:44:27,392 --> 01:44:28,160
Compelling argument

2173
01:44:28,416 --> 01:44:30,976
You heard both sides

2174
01:44:34,560 --> 01:44:35,584
He's doing this him

2175
01:44:35,840 --> 01:44:36,608
Spell fright

2176
01:44:36,864 --> 01:44:37,888
Is there something behind

2177
01:44:39,424 --> 01:44:41,728
They convince them of that and it's Wolfgang halbig

2178
01:44:42,752 --> 01:44:44,800
He hasn't demonstrated that in any way

2179
01:44:46,080 --> 01:44:48,640
I don't know I

2180
01:44:48,896 --> 01:44:50,688
Because originally I was thinking that it

2181
01:44:50,944 --> 01:44:51,456
It was some sort of

2182
01:44:51,712 --> 01:44:52,224
Outside

2183
01:44:53,504 --> 01:44:54,272
Influence

2184
01:44:54,528 --> 01:44:55,808
But then

2185
01:44:56,064 --> 01:44:57,856
Now to put this in there for

2186
01:44:58,624 --> 01:44:59,648
No reason real

2187
01:44:59,904 --> 01:45:04,000
Like there's no point in throwing other than you giving him

2188
01:45:04,256 --> 01:45:05,024
Possible credit for

2189
01:45:05,792 --> 01:45:08,352
Setting the groundwork for being able to call

2190
01:45:09,632 --> 01:45:10,144
A completely

2191
01:45:12,960 --> 01:45:14,496
But it also sounds like

2192
01:45:14,752 --> 01:45:16,800
Call whenever he was just having that

2193
01:45:17,312 --> 01:45:18,336
That fun like

2194
01:45:19,616 --> 01:45:25,760
Free associative like all the sudden yeah these guys are actors to throw that in there

2195
01:45:26,272 --> 01:45:28,320
Excited to call everything

2196
01:45:31,392 --> 01:45:32,928
So smart you figured out

2197
01:45:33,184 --> 01:45:33,952
Fake and all this

2198
01:45:34,208 --> 01:45:36,768
It does feel that way and on some level

2199
01:45:37,280 --> 01:45:38,048
A bit of that could

2200
01:45:38,304 --> 01:45:39,072
Possibly be

2201
01:45:39,328 --> 01:45:40,096
Explained by

2202
01:45:40,608 --> 01:45:42,400
When he had James Tracy on

2203
01:45:42,656 --> 01:45:45,472
A big part of it

2204
01:45:45,728 --> 01:45:51,872
Was a recognition that there was 10 million views of this video that I put out there was a big Market

2205
01:45:52,384 --> 01:45:53,664
Right that was

2206
01:45:53,920 --> 01:45:55,200
Recalling things

2207
01:45:55,456 --> 01:45:57,504
Exactly

2208
01:45:57,760 --> 01:46:01,088
I don't think it's unreasonable to look at it as

2209
01:46:01,344 --> 01:46:04,672
In the intervening month or so they've seen that

2210
01:46:04,928 --> 01:46:05,952
Hasn't gone away

2211
01:46:06,208 --> 01:46:09,792
Yeah this is a pretty lucrative fertile

2212
01:46:10,048 --> 01:46:10,816
Space

2213
01:46:11,328 --> 01:46:11,840
Conspiracy

2214
01:46:12,864 --> 01:46:13,376
Growing

2215
01:46:14,144 --> 01:46:15,680
So I think it it's it's a

2216
01:46:15,936 --> 01:46:16,704
Possibility

2217
01:46:17,472 --> 01:46:17,984
When is the case

2218
01:46:18,240 --> 01:46:19,520
But it is a possibility

2219
01:46:19,776 --> 01:46:23,616
Is that there is Market viability in Colorado

2220
01:46:23,872 --> 01:46:24,384
Fake

2221
01:46:24,640 --> 01:46:25,408
And Alex

2222
01:46:25,664 --> 01:46:27,968
Is allowing himself to dip into that

2223
01:46:28,480 --> 01:46:29,504
Right that's

2224
01:46:30,016 --> 01:46:32,576
Another possibility is Alex is aware that he is working

2225
01:46:32,832 --> 01:46:33,344
Towards

2226
01:46:33,600 --> 01:46:34,368
Sandy Hook

2227
01:46:34,880 --> 01:46:36,416
Yeah and the day it was all actors

2228
01:46:36,672 --> 01:46:38,720
Because we do know that that is where he

2229
01:46:39,744 --> 01:46:43,584
Right and if he knows that that's the conclusion you're getting to

2230
01:46:43,840 --> 01:46:44,608
It makes sense

2231
01:46:44,864 --> 01:46:46,144
To build up to that

2232
01:46:46,912 --> 01:46:51,008
Have the have the groundwork laid

2233
01:46:51,520 --> 01:46:52,544
Incorporating it into

2234
01:46:52,800 --> 01:46:53,312
These other

2235
01:46:53,824 --> 01:46:55,360
Thing

2236
01:46:55,616 --> 01:46:56,384
Pretty consistent

2237
01:46:56,640 --> 01:46:57,152
We coming up

2238
01:46:57,408 --> 01:46:59,200
Accusations of things involving Act

2239
01:46:59,456 --> 01:47:00,480
It doesn't

2240
01:47:00,736 --> 01:47:01,248
Seem

2241
01:47:01,760 --> 01:47:02,272
Organic

2242
01:47:03,040 --> 01:47:03,552
Right

2243
01:47:03,808 --> 01:47:06,880
It did it could be explained by your

2244
01:47:07,136 --> 01:47:09,696
Theory that he got drunk and watched YouTube

2245
01:47:09,952 --> 01:47:12,000
And it's like hey it's fun to call Diggs actress

2246
01:47:12,256 --> 01:47:17,888
I admit that that's a possibility that's not a low possibility

2247
01:47:18,400 --> 01:47:18,912
Mine

2248
01:47:19,168 --> 01:47:20,704
Suspicions are also possibility

2249
01:47:20,960 --> 01:47:21,472
Absolute

2250
01:47:21,984 --> 01:47:23,008
100

2251
01:47:23,776 --> 01:47:24,800
Possible explanation

2252
01:47:25,056 --> 01:47:26,592
Oceans 41

2253
01:47:27,616 --> 01:47:31,712
But I'm looking at it and I I can't escape the conclusion that it is happy

2254
01:47:31,968 --> 01:47:33,248
Yeah I know absolutely

2255
01:47:34,528 --> 01:47:35,808
I'm going to go with money

2256
01:47:36,064 --> 01:47:36,576
Ivory

2257
01:47:36,832 --> 01:47:40,672
Until proven otherwise I'm going to go with some sort of

2258
01:47:41,440 --> 01:47:45,024
And again this comes down to the limitation of looking at it the way we do

2259
01:47:45,280 --> 01:47:47,840
Is it I can tell you that there is something going on

2260
01:47:48,096 --> 01:47:51,168
Right with the available information that I have I can't tell you

2261
01:47:51,424 --> 01:47:53,216
Exactly how it plays out yet

2262
01:47:53,728 --> 01:47:57,312
And I also may never be able to tell you the exact

2263
01:47:57,568 --> 01:47:59,360
I give you the possibilities

2264
01:47:59,872 --> 01:48:01,920
But I don't know outside of Alex

2265
01:48:02,176 --> 01:48:03,712
Confessing

2266
01:48:03,968 --> 01:48:07,808
This lawsuit revealing emails that showed machinations

2267
01:48:08,320 --> 01:48:08,832
Deceived

2268
01:48:09,344 --> 01:48:12,416
I'm not sure that I would ever be able to give you the Y

2269
01:48:12,672 --> 01:48:14,208
Frustrating

2270
01:48:15,744 --> 01:48:17,536
This does not appear to me

2271
01:48:18,048 --> 01:48:20,608
From my time studying Alex Jones to be a coincidence

2272
01:48:21,120 --> 01:48:22,912
Now we got it appears to be

2273
01:48:23,168 --> 01:48:23,936
Weather

2274
01:48:24,192 --> 01:48:24,704
Conscious

2275
01:48:24,960 --> 01:48:25,472
Orkin

2276
01:48:25,984 --> 01:48:27,520
Petition to incorporate

2277
01:48:27,776 --> 01:48:28,800
Crisis actors

2278
01:48:29,056 --> 01:48:29,568
Do a bunch of stuff

2279
01:48:30,080 --> 01:48:31,360
I think

2280
01:48:32,384 --> 01:48:35,456
I don't think it's possible for us ever to

2281
01:48:35,712 --> 01:48:36,480
To know because I don't

2282
01:48:37,504 --> 01:48:38,272
Anyway that Alex

2283
01:48:39,296 --> 01:48:39,808
Concrete

2284
01:48:40,064 --> 01:48:40,832
Concrete Lino's

2285
01:48:41,088 --> 01:48:41,856
Squidward eats

2286
01:48:42,112 --> 01:48:44,416
Cuz it's not like we could do an interview with Alex like

2287
01:48:44,672 --> 01:48:45,184
20 years

2288
01:48:45,440 --> 01:48:48,256
When he's not on the air and he's got nothing to lose

2289
01:48:48,512 --> 01:48:52,864
We can't trust a thing he says cuz there's no way that he lay remember it or be

2290
01:48:53,120 --> 01:48:53,888
Bother to tell

2291
01:48:54,144 --> 01:48:55,680
Some insightful person

2292
01:48:55,936 --> 01:48:57,472
And who used to work at Infowars

2293
01:48:57,728 --> 01:48:58,496
If breeds

2294
01:48:58,752 --> 01:49:01,568
From their non-disclosure agreement we could

2295
01:49:01,824 --> 01:49:02,336
Explain

2296
01:49:02,592 --> 01:49:05,152
The Dynamics

2297
01:49:05,408 --> 01:49:06,688
But would have to be a third party

2298
01:49:06,944 --> 01:49:07,456
Before sure

2299
01:49:09,504 --> 01:49:10,016
Be there for

2300
01:49:11,296 --> 01:49:13,088
It would I think it requires

2301
01:49:13,344 --> 01:49:14,112
Those

2302
01:49:15,136 --> 01:49:17,696
What about her email said

2303
01:49:18,976 --> 01:49:20,768
So because Alex

2304
01:49:21,024 --> 01:49:22,304
Is he's getting pretty

2305
01:49:22,816 --> 01:49:24,864
Extreme I mean he's already yelled about Obama's

2306
01:49:25,120 --> 01:49:26,656
The devil for an hour

2307
01:49:28,192 --> 01:49:29,472
Troubling if proven

2308
01:49:29,728 --> 01:49:30,240
Right

2309
01:49:30,752 --> 01:49:33,056
He is building up this idea that

2310
01:49:33,824 --> 01:49:34,592
This is

2311
01:49:34,848 --> 01:49:36,128
An existential battle

2312
01:49:37,664 --> 01:49:38,432
He wants his audience

2313
01:49:38,944 --> 01:49:39,456
Understand

2314
01:49:39,968 --> 01:49:40,480
Is

2315
01:49:40,992 --> 01:49:42,784
That if they lose it's all over

2316
01:49:43,296 --> 01:49:44,576
If they win then it

2317
01:49:45,856 --> 01:49:47,392
This is how he's

2318
01:49:57,376 --> 01:49:59,936
The function of rhetoric like that is in order to

2319
01:50:00,192 --> 01:50:00,960
To justify

2320
01:50:01,216 --> 01:50:01,728
Success

2321
01:50:01,984 --> 01:50:02,496
On your side

2322
01:50:03,264 --> 01:50:05,056
If you presented as an ex

2323
01:50:05,312 --> 01:50:07,872
Substantial battle where if we lose we lose everything

2324
01:50:08,384 --> 01:50:09,152
Advair

2325
01:50:09,408 --> 01:50:11,200
For it all

2326
01:50:11,712 --> 01:50:17,856
They're using actors to create this completely fictional reality in order to

2327
01:50:18,112 --> 01:50:19,392
Brainwash people

2328
01:50:19,904 --> 01:50:22,720
If they're going for it all we're going for it all

2329
01:50:23,232 --> 01:50:24,512
And that is not good

2330
01:50:25,024 --> 01:50:31,168
Because you're creating a fictional version of what the enemy is doing in order to justify these very real things that you are doing

2331
01:50:31,424 --> 01:50:36,544
The enemy is going to commit war crimes we have no choice but to fight them on their level

2332
01:50:36,800 --> 01:50:40,128
If they're going to burn our farms and couldn't commit to Total War

2333
01:50:40,384 --> 01:50:42,688
Then we have to burn their farms in theirs

2334
01:50:43,456 --> 01:50:46,016
Grimes

2335
01:50:46,272 --> 01:50:47,040
You know it is

2336
01:50:47,296 --> 01:50:47,808
Somewhat

2337
01:50:48,064 --> 01:50:48,576
Relevant

2338
01:50:49,088 --> 01:50:49,600
Because

2339
01:50:50,112 --> 01:50:50,880
As we discussed

2340
01:50:51,136 --> 01:50:52,160
The beginning of this episode

2341
01:50:52,416 --> 01:50:55,744
Alex is making predictions about what the globalist are going to do

2342
01:50:56,000 --> 01:50:58,048
This false flag that they're going today

2343
01:50:58,304 --> 01:51:02,912
Pull-off

2344
01:51:05,216 --> 01:51:06,752
What's the prediction

2345
01:51:21,344 --> 01:51:23,904
Can you do

2346
01:51:25,696 --> 01:51:27,488
So it's all very consist

2347
01:51:27,744 --> 01:51:32,096
It's a repetition of the blame the Patriot

2348
01:51:32,864 --> 01:51:34,144
He's listed the cities but

2349
01:51:34,912 --> 01:51:35,680
Are the target

2350
01:51:36,192 --> 01:51:37,472
Chicago primarily

2351
01:51:39,264 --> 01:51:40,288
Whether or not

2352
01:51:41,312 --> 01:51:43,360
He says there's going to be a false flag all the time

2353
01:51:43,616 --> 01:51:44,128
So

2354
01:51:44,384 --> 01:51:47,200
When there is an actual terrorist attack

2355
01:51:47,456 --> 01:51:48,992
As the Boston bombing

2356
01:51:49,504 --> 01:51:50,016
It doesn't

2357
01:51:50,272 --> 01:51:52,064
Lend him any more credibility

2358
01:51:52,576 --> 01:51:53,856
He said there was something coming

2359
01:51:54,368 --> 01:51:55,648
Especially when you look back

2360
01:51:55,904 --> 01:51:56,416
Can feel like

2361
01:51:56,928 --> 01:51:57,696
Specifically

2362
01:51:57,952 --> 01:51:58,464
Predicting

2363
01:51:58,720 --> 01:51:59,232
Something

2364
01:51:59,488 --> 01:52:00,768
Completely different

2365
01:52:01,792 --> 01:52:05,376
So going to be another school shooting

2366
01:52:05,888 --> 01:52:06,656
That's not

2367
01:52:07,680 --> 01:52:08,960
Local news

2368
01:52:09,728 --> 01:52:10,496
Would give anything

2369
01:52:10,752 --> 01:52:11,776
Sing for that kind of

2370
01:52:12,288 --> 01:52:12,800
Throw to break

2371
01:52:13,568 --> 01:52:15,360
Like they have to be like

2372
01:52:15,616 --> 01:52:21,760
Is there something in your food

2373
01:52:22,016 --> 01:52:27,904
Still not as bad as Alex

2374
01:52:28,416 --> 01:52:31,744
We'll see you in five pretty distracted

2375
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:33,792
Bad so Alex

2376
01:52:34,048 --> 01:52:34,560
Like

2377
01:52:34,816 --> 01:52:37,632
There's been a lot of stuff in this episode

2378
01:52:37,888 --> 01:52:39,168
Like I think we're seeing this tent

2379
01:52:39,680 --> 01:52:41,472
C towards actor narrative

2380
01:52:41,728 --> 01:52:46,592
I think Alex is prediction of a nuke in Chicago is pretty important because

2381
01:52:46,848 --> 01:52:47,360
He's going to

2382
01:52:47,616 --> 01:52:50,944
Predicted the Boston bombing when it happens

2383
01:52:51,200 --> 01:52:52,224
I see clearly is not

2384
01:52:52,480 --> 01:52:52,992
Of course

2385
01:52:53,248 --> 01:52:54,528
LOL that's pretty important

2386
01:52:54,784 --> 01:52:56,576
What is about to happen is not

2387
01:52:57,600 --> 01:52:58,624
But I think it's

2388
01:52:58,880 --> 01:52:59,392
Pretty

2389
01:53:01,440 --> 01:53:02,976
Alex has decided

2390
01:53:03,232 --> 01:53:03,744
That

2391
01:53:04,256 --> 01:53:04,768
Coyotes

2392
01:53:05,280 --> 01:53:06,048
Are very picky

2393
01:53:06,816 --> 01:53:10,144
Not not people who smuggle people know

2394
01:53:10,400 --> 01:53:11,424
You know what's fun

2395
01:53:11,936 --> 01:53:18,080
Not for one moment did I think it was anything other than literally coyotes Alex believes that there

2396
01:53:18,336 --> 01:53:24,480
Coyote murder happening

2397
01:53:25,504 --> 01:53:26,528
Purely coyotes

2398
01:53:26,784 --> 01:53:32,672
People are being killed by Coyotes no

2399
01:53:32,928 --> 01:53:33,696
He says they're being eaten

2400
01:53:33,952 --> 01:53:34,720
By Coyotes

2401
01:53:34,976 --> 01:53:36,512
And he believes

2402
01:53:36,768 --> 01:53:38,304
That the globalists are trying

2403
01:53:38,816 --> 01:53:41,376
Train people to be attacked by coyote

2404
01:53:41,632 --> 01:53:43,168
By watching horror movies

2405
01:53:43,680 --> 01:53:49,824
Because in horror movies like in the Jason movie you know the character will run away and then trip and fall

2406
01:53:50,080 --> 01:53:53,408
No.

2407
01:53:53,664 --> 01:53:54,432
She's going to trip and fall

2408
01:53:54,688 --> 01:53:55,712
That's just cruel

2409
01:53:55,968 --> 01:53:57,760
So Alex believes that this program

2410
01:53:58,016 --> 01:54:04,160
People coyote

2411
01:54:04,416 --> 01:54:04,928
The greatest

2412
01:54:06,208 --> 01:54:08,512
Plan the globalist to have ever come up with

2413
01:54:08,768 --> 01:54:09,280
This is

2414
01:54:09,536 --> 01:54:11,072
Amazing

2415
01:54:11,328 --> 01:54:12,096
Alex's

2416
01:54:12,352 --> 01:54:12,864
Really

2417
01:54:13,120 --> 01:54:15,424
Cigarettes playing now

2418
01:54:34,880 --> 01:54:36,672
Rawlings fall down

2419
01:54:43,584 --> 01:54:47,168
Coyotes coming in in in

2420
01:54:49,984 --> 01:54:50,496
This is

2421
01:54:51,264 --> 01:54:51,776
Ridiculous

2422
01:54:52,288 --> 01:54:58,432
First of all I don't know if anybody watches a horror movie and thinks that the person who's being killed by Jason is having a great time

2423
01:55:03,552 --> 01:55:04,320
First things first

2424
01:55:06,368 --> 01:55:07,904
Alright you're good you're good dude

2425
01:55:08,160 --> 01:55:08,928
Let me make a

2426
01:55:09,184 --> 01:55:09,696
Real clear

2427
01:55:09,952 --> 01:55:13,280
People that is not a big problem

2428
01:55:13,536 --> 01:55:19,680
In the United States really want to believe you Dan interactions released

2429
01:55:19,936 --> 01:55:26,080
2017 of the phenomenon of humans being attacked by Coyotes

2430
01:55:26,336 --> 01:55:29,152
70 and 2015 I assume it is 100%

2431
01:55:29,408 --> 01:55:29,920
Shorter women

2432
01:55:30,432 --> 01:55:34,016
Between 1977 and 2015 there were 360

2433
01:55:34,272 --> 01:55:36,576
7 instances of humans being attacked by coyote

2434
01:55:37,088 --> 01:55:41,952
And when you eliminate rabies as a variable because any rabid animals going to text

2435
01:55:43,744 --> 01:55:44,256
AC3 the follow

2436
01:55:45,024 --> 01:55:45,536
1

2437
01:55:45,792 --> 01:55:47,840
Coyotes generally attack when they're corner

2438
01:55:48,352 --> 01:55:53,984
With the elimination of wildlands where they can roam free their environments that are foreign

2439
01:55:54,240 --> 01:55:55,776
Causing some disrupt

2440
01:55:56,544 --> 01:56:00,128
They have the behavioral plasticity to live in urban environments

2441
01:56:00,384 --> 01:56:00,896
What causes

2442
01:56:02,176 --> 01:56:02,688
2

2443
01:56:02,944 --> 01:56:05,248
The vast majority of attacks occurred in California

2444
01:56:05,504 --> 01:56:07,040
Due to Natural coyote population

2445
01:56:08,576 --> 01:56:11,904
The text also seem to follow a pattern where they increased around the times when

2446
01:56:12,160 --> 01:56:14,720
Coyotes would be either pregnant or nursing their pups

2447
01:56:15,232 --> 01:56:17,280
Position of foods

2448
01:56:18,304 --> 01:56:19,840
This isn't to say that they were attacking humans

2449
01:56:20,608 --> 01:56:23,424
But that over time they've lost their fear of humans

2450
01:56:23,680 --> 01:56:25,472
They've also begun to associate humans

2451
01:56:25,728 --> 01:56:26,240
With food

2452
01:56:26,496 --> 01:56:29,824
Environment that humans live in or resource-rich environment

2453
01:56:31,104 --> 01:56:31,872
Think of what camp

2454
01:56:33,664 --> 01:56:35,968
When you start to think about that it's

2455
01:56:36,224 --> 01:56:38,784
See how the very basic Association could be babe

2456
01:56:39,040 --> 01:56:41,344
Do the presence of humans in the availability of food

2457
01:56:41,856 --> 01:56:45,440
It's theorized that this Association has been made by the coyote population

2458
01:56:46,720 --> 01:56:48,256
Exist in more urban areas

2459
01:56:48,768 --> 01:56:50,560
And many of the attacks we've seen

2460
01:56:50,816 --> 01:56:51,584
Open out of food

2461
01:56:52,352 --> 01:56:53,376
They believe that attacking you

2462
01:56:53,632 --> 01:56:54,656
Women's up will open up

2463
01:56:54,912 --> 01:56:56,192
Food resource

2464
01:56:56,704 --> 01:57:00,288
F*** you I used to live here killed everybody

2465
01:57:01,824 --> 01:57:04,640
Trying to live here and you're still fighting me

2466
01:57:04,896 --> 01:57:05,408
Albeit

2467
01:57:06,176 --> 01:57:12,320
Define the phenomenon of wild animals becoming the living room

2468
01:57:12,576 --> 01:57:14,624
Generally when things like rabies aren't in play

2469
01:57:14,880 --> 01:57:16,928
Habituated and don'ts

2470
01:57:17,696 --> 01:57:20,256
The threat they mostly don't attack people without a reason

2471
01:57:20,512 --> 01:57:23,584
Like being cornered or if there's a drop-off in available food

2472
01:57:23,840 --> 01:57:27,424
Often as precipitated by a decreasing in the population of a species

2473
01:57:27,680 --> 01:57:28,448
Their prey

2474
01:57:28,960 --> 01:57:30,496
It's a byproduct of the interconnect

2475
01:57:31,008 --> 01:57:34,080
Something that we are apart of as much as Alex my one

2476
01:57:34,336 --> 01:57:34,848
Pretend otherwise

2477
01:57:35,872 --> 01:57:37,664
Also only to the 360

2478
01:57:37,920 --> 01:57:38,944
B7 coyote interaction

2479
01:57:39,968 --> 01:57:40,480
Support life

2480
01:57:41,760 --> 01:57:43,552
When was back in 1980

2481
01:57:43,808 --> 01:57:45,088
The victim was a three-year-old child

2482
01:57:45,344 --> 01:57:46,368
Which is incredibly tragic

2483
01:57:46,880 --> 01:57:51,744
But I can't guarantee that the child did not watch horror movies and then decide running away from

2484
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:55,840
The coyote would be fun

2485
01:57:56,096 --> 01:57:57,120
44 horror movie

2486
01:57:57,632 --> 01:58:01,472
Three-year-old watches

2487
01:58:01,984 --> 01:58:02,496
I don't I don't

2488
01:58:02,752 --> 01:58:04,544
I don't I don't

2489
01:58:05,056 --> 01:58:07,360
That it's

2490
01:58:07,616 --> 01:58:09,920
Dubious to suggest

2491
01:58:10,176 --> 01:58:14,016
The other instance was in 2009 Jose 19 year old folk singer

2492
01:58:14,272 --> 01:58:16,320
Who is killed by Coyotes in Nova Scotia

2493
01:58:16,576 --> 01:58:17,856
So that wasn't even in the United

2494
01:58:18,880 --> 01:58:20,672
Again this is a real tragic situation

2495
01:58:20,928 --> 01:58:25,536
And I'm not minimizing it at all but experts discuss the situation

2496
01:58:25,792 --> 01:58:27,072
The most likely situation

2497
01:58:27,584 --> 01:58:28,608
That you was hiking alone

2498
01:58:28,864 --> 01:58:31,424
And probably encountered a group of coyotes

2499
01:58:32,448 --> 01:58:34,496
And that they were likely protecting a deer they

2500
01:58:35,776 --> 01:58:36,544
Whatever the specific

2501
01:58:36,800 --> 01:58:38,080
Details for situation doesn't mean

2502
01:58:38,336 --> 01:58:39,104
Alex's b*******

2503
01:58:39,360 --> 01:58:40,896
Either and coyotes didn't

2504
01:58:41,664 --> 01:58:42,688
People came to her Aid

2505
01:58:42,944 --> 01:58:44,992
I'm scared off the coyotes called for help and then she

2506
01:58:45,248 --> 01:58:46,528
She died from her injuries At the Hop

2507
01:58:47,808 --> 01:58:48,320
I noticed

2508
01:58:48,576 --> 01:58:51,392
Might seem like a minor weird thing to focus on

2509
01:58:51,648 --> 01:58:53,440
But I think it's a really good example of how

2510
01:58:53,696 --> 01:58:54,720
Authoritatively Alex

2511
01:58:54,976 --> 01:58:55,488
Speaks

2512
01:58:55,744 --> 01:58:56,256
Tuxedos in.

2513
01:58:56,512 --> 01:58:57,024
Sing about

2514
01:58:57,536 --> 01:58:58,816
This is complete b*******

2515
01:58:59,072 --> 01:59:00,352
And yet he's delivering this bitumen

2516
01:59:00,608 --> 01:59:01,120
Information

2517
01:59:01,376 --> 01:59:02,656
Study the topic in depth

2518
01:59:03,424 --> 01:59:05,472
It's important to highlight these examples sometimes

2519
01:59:05,728 --> 01:59:06,752
Because they illustrate would have

2520
01:59:07,008 --> 01:59:07,520
Con man

2521
01:59:08,032 --> 01:59:10,848
Self-reflection

2522
01:59:11,104 --> 01:59:11,616
He's capable of

2523
01:59:12,384 --> 01:59:15,456
He just Rambles rants about Notions and things he's making up

2524
01:59:15,712 --> 01:59:16,224
Feel-Rite

2525
01:59:16,736 --> 01:59:19,040
70% them as if they're well-researched fat

2526
01:59:19,808 --> 01:59:20,832
Would you recognize the

2527
01:59:21,088 --> 01:59:22,112
Does this about coyotes

2528
01:59:22,368 --> 01:59:25,952
Is eating people regularly because the globalist have trained him not to

2529
01:59:26,208 --> 01:59:26,720
To fight back

2530
01:59:26,976 --> 01:59:29,792
It opens the door to recognizing that he does this about everything

2531
01:59:30,560 --> 01:59:32,352
He's never read a study on coyote attack

2532
01:59:33,120 --> 01:59:33,888
Like he's never read

2533
01:59:36,192 --> 01:59:37,472
Everything is b*******

2534
01:59:37,728 --> 01:59:39,008
And coyote

2535
01:59:39,264 --> 01:59:40,544
Murder eating people

2536
01:59:40,800 --> 01:59:43,872
Is such a good doorway into understanding

2537
01:59:46,688 --> 01:59:47,200
Swing

2538
01:59:47,712 --> 01:59:53,856
That's just such a swing for the fences Urban cities in America

2539
01:59:54,624 --> 01:59:55,136
There's

2540
01:59:55,392 --> 01:59:56,160
Zerorez

2541
01:59:56,416 --> 01:59:57,696
Cuz he's already f****** crazy

2542
01:59:58,208 --> 01:59:59,232
That anybody is going to

2543
01:59:59,488 --> 02:00:01,024
Call him out on his coyote bulshit

2544
02:00:02,816 --> 02:00:03,328
Some

2545
02:00:03,840 --> 02:00:05,888
Freak happenstance he's right about the

2546
02:00:06,144 --> 02:00:07,168
The coyote murders

2547
02:00:07,424 --> 02:00:07,936
Situation

2548
02:00:08,192 --> 02:00:11,520
He's the most brilliant man in the world

2549
02:00:11,776 --> 02:00:14,848
He's not the most brilliant man in the world

2550
02:00:15,104 --> 02:00:18,944
It just so people don't think that I'm just taking a little clip of this

2551
02:00:20,480 --> 02:00:22,784
He's actually saying that coyotes are killing

2552
02:00:23,040 --> 02:00:23,552
People

2553
02:00:23,808 --> 02:00:24,320
Here's some more

2554
02:00:43,008 --> 02:00:46,592
I looked through instances of coyote attacks

2555
02:00:46,848 --> 02:00:52,992
None of the none of the stories I could find mirror this in anyway

2556
02:00:53,504 --> 02:00:56,576
Bloopers of the right

2557
02:00:56,832 --> 02:00:59,392
Easter lunch with two coyotes

2558
02:00:59,648 --> 02:01:05,792
The ability to switch between coyotes

2559
02:01:07,072 --> 02:01:09,632
It's a different way so she's just eating their lunch

2560
02:01:11,424 --> 02:01:12,960
Highly populated area

2561
02:01:13,472 --> 02:01:18,336
Can get there cuz there's so many people missing her

2562
02:01:18,592 --> 02:01:23,456
Eaten by two coyotes bystander coyote

2563
02:01:23,712 --> 02:01:24,480
Add stuff

2564
02:01:48,288 --> 02:01:54,432
Anime

2565
02:02:07,488 --> 02:02:09,280
This is

2566
02:02:10,816 --> 02:02:11,328
Ludacris

2567
02:02:15,168 --> 02:02:21,312
Play

2568
02:02:43,328 --> 02:02:46,656
Native American

2569
02:02:57,920 --> 02:03:01,248
Restarting the train

2570
02:03:01,760 --> 02:03:02,272
What's up

2571
02:03:02,784 --> 02:03:03,296
So

2572
02:03:04,064 --> 02:03:04,832
So he's

2573
02:03:05,344 --> 02:03:08,160
He's defending wolves killing people

2574
02:03:08,928 --> 02:03:12,512
Because he's putting the onus upon you

2575
02:03:12,768 --> 02:03:14,816
The person getting eaten by the wolf

2576
02:03:15,584 --> 02:03:18,400
I don't know I'm with Wolves

2577
02:03:18,656 --> 02:03:19,424
Is very similar to

2578
02:03:19,680 --> 02:03:22,496
Situation with coyote

2579
02:03:22,752 --> 02:03:27,360
His worldview and his worldview are now roving packs of

2580
02:03:27,872 --> 02:03:28,896
Bucking Warriors

2581
02:03:29,408 --> 02:03:32,992
Coming out to murder helpless innocent women on their lunch break

2582
02:03:33,248 --> 02:03:39,392
In the dead of winter

2583
02:03:39,648 --> 02:03:42,464
He is Rehabilitation

2584
02:03:42,720 --> 02:03:44,512
Beautiful

2585
02:03:44,768 --> 02:03:49,888
Yeah it's unfair it's unfair to both animals really I mean

2586
02:03:50,144 --> 02:03:53,472
The target of real maligned perception

2587
02:03:57,312 --> 02:03:58,336
Of them based on

2588
02:03:58,848 --> 02:03:59,616
Perception

2589
02:03:59,872 --> 02:04:00,640
There there

2590
02:04:01,664 --> 02:04:02,688
Predators

2591
02:04:02,944 --> 02:04:07,808
And woke up.

2592
02:04:10,112 --> 02:04:10,880
Really many

2593
02:04:11,648 --> 02:04:13,440
I think I could find two examples

2594
02:04:13,696 --> 02:04:14,720
Again

2595
02:04:14,976 --> 02:04:16,512
Confirm people who have been killed

2596
02:04:17,024 --> 02:04:17,792
By wolves

2597
02:04:18,048 --> 02:04:18,816
In North America

2598
02:04:19,072 --> 02:04:20,096
Coyotes

2599
02:04:20,608 --> 02:04:22,400
Definitely for coyote

2600
02:04:22,912 --> 02:04:23,680
But then with Wolves

2601
02:04:23,936 --> 02:04:27,264
I could find to most of the reasons I can find

2602
02:04:27,520 --> 02:04:31,104
Only had two examples

2603
02:04:31,360 --> 02:04:32,640
Native American

2604
02:04:33,664 --> 02:04:34,176
Sure

2605
02:04:34,432 --> 02:04:40,320
Leaving the Wolves decide what we have here when you really get down to it is Alex trying to make his audience scared about it

2606
02:04:40,576 --> 02:04:41,856
Completely made up thing

2607
02:04:42,368 --> 02:04:44,672
Which is the famous plague of women being eaten by Coyotes

2608
02:04:45,184 --> 02:04:46,208
And then trying to make them

2609
02:04:46,464 --> 02:04:47,488
Scared about how the globalist

2610
02:04:47,744 --> 02:04:48,256
Trains

2611
02:04:48,512 --> 02:04:49,024
Unable to

2612
02:04:49,280 --> 02:04:50,048
Defend themselves

2613
02:04:50,304 --> 02:04:51,584
For being eaten by the coyote

2614
02:04:51,840 --> 02:04:55,424
Really really going to have to stop here are we

2615
02:04:55,680 --> 02:04:57,728
Ultimately it's all made up

2616
02:04:57,984 --> 02:04:59,264
But that's not what this is

2617
02:04:59,520 --> 02:05:00,032
Is about

2618
02:05:00,288 --> 02:05:02,336
Now that we've gotten to the end of this rant

2619
02:05:02,592 --> 02:05:05,664
See Clearly this was never about the fake woman being eaten by Coyotes

2620
02:05:06,176 --> 02:05:08,480
It's about I was yelling at his audience about how big

2621
02:05:08,736 --> 02:05:09,504
And strong of a boy

2622
02:05:10,272 --> 02:05:12,320
He's not afraid of coyotes

2623
02:05:12,832 --> 02:05:15,136
After that I guess I applaud him

2624
02:05:15,392 --> 02:05:16,416
Have time for his show

2625
02:05:16,928 --> 02:05:23,072
But he's making stuff up and all that leads to is I'm strong and brave I'm so powerful

2626
02:05:23,328 --> 02:05:24,608
Never fall down in the face of

2627
02:05:24,864 --> 02:05:25,376
Coyote

2628
02:05:25,632 --> 02:05:26,656
Great.

2629
02:05:26,912 --> 02:05:27,424
That's

2630
02:05:29,984 --> 02:05:31,264
That's the mark of a true leader

2631
02:05:31,776 --> 02:05:34,592
I mean if you fall into that that's the only thing that I need to

2632
02:05:35,360 --> 02:05:38,688
I would say that it's ironic that it's begin this episode Alex

2633
02:05:38,944 --> 02:05:40,224
Accusing to see how far

2634
02:05:42,528 --> 02:05:43,808
The democratic debate

2635
02:05:44,064 --> 02:05:44,832
F*** no

2636
02:05:45,088 --> 02:05:48,416
Throw a coyote in there whoever stands their ground new president

2637
02:05:49,440 --> 02:05:50,208
Done good

2638
02:05:52,256 --> 02:05:54,048
From the 22nd

2639
02:05:54,304 --> 02:05:55,840
And against Alex predicting

2640
02:05:56,096 --> 02:05:56,864
This upcoming

2641
02:05:57,120 --> 02:05:58,144
False flag terrorism

2642
02:06:00,448 --> 02:06:01,728
He names multiple cities

2643
02:06:02,240 --> 02:06:04,032
April talks very specifically

2644
02:06:04,544 --> 02:06:06,080
And

2645
02:06:06,336 --> 02:06:07,104
Pay close attention

2646
02:06:07,360 --> 02:06:09,664
None of this has to do anything with us

2647
02:06:18,624 --> 02:06:22,208
Atomic weapon in Chicago

2648
02:06:26,048 --> 02:06:28,096
Coupons for Target

2649
02:06:29,632 --> 02:06:31,680
Chicago Cleveland Denver

2650
02:06:32,448 --> 02:06:33,216
Places like that

2651
02:06:34,496 --> 02:06:37,824
What About Bob

2652
02:06:39,872 --> 02:06:41,920
Was the Sears Tower

2653
02:06:42,432 --> 02:06:48,576
Is a nice man

2654
02:06:48,832 --> 02:06:51,392
Coyotes are on a rampage

2655
02:06:51,648 --> 02:06:53,184
Do coyotes are on Earth

2656
02:06:53,696 --> 02:06:59,840
Yeah I bet he's very specifically there is you know how Alex talk what he saying is they're going to Nuke

2657
02:07:00,096 --> 02:07:01,376
The Willis Tower

2658
02:07:01,632 --> 02:07:02,912
Login Duke Sears Tower

2659
02:07:03,424 --> 02:07:04,960
So his production issue

2660
02:07:05,216 --> 02:07:08,800
None of them were Boston

2661
02:07:09,056 --> 02:07:09,568
Austin

2662
02:07:09,824 --> 02:07:11,872
Yeah I guess you could say cities like that

2663
02:07:12,128 --> 02:07:17,248
Include faucet in a large city

2664
02:07:17,504 --> 02:07:18,016
Alex

2665
02:07:18,272 --> 02:07:20,320
This is no good this prediction that you're making a s***

2666
02:07:21,088 --> 02:07:24,160
I needed to get through this large

2667
02:07:24,416 --> 02:07:25,696
Kerchunk of time on this

2668
02:07:25,952 --> 02:07:27,232
So I'm glad we were able to

2669
02:07:28,512 --> 02:07:29,024
He's trying to start

2670
02:07:29,280 --> 02:07:29,792
To develop

2671
02:07:30,816 --> 02:07:31,584
More fully

2672
02:07:33,120 --> 02:07:33,888
Trying to convince

2673
02:07:34,144 --> 02:07:40,288
He's going to say before I really think I do everyday

2674
02:07:40,544 --> 02:07:46,688
Ed every time

2675
02:07:46,944 --> 02:07:48,992
Accelerated or decelerate in his timeline

2676
02:07:49,248 --> 02:07:55,392
For saying what we all know he's going to say anything.

2677
02:07:55,648 --> 02:07:58,720
In the past because he knew that eventually one

2678
02:07:59,488 --> 02:08:02,560
Coyotes will become an actual threat so I assume in the next 6 months

2679
02:08:02,816 --> 02:08:08,704
Sprite and take a lunch break indoors later

2680
02:08:08,960 --> 02:08:11,008
Dear psychic he could see the future

2681
02:08:11,264 --> 02:08:12,544
And he's f****** with us a

2682
02:08:13,312 --> 02:08:16,896
Either this podcast was eventually going through

2683
02:08:18,944 --> 02:08:24,832
Only question that remains the ultimate and the road is saying that

2684
02:08:25,088 --> 02:08:25,856
Victims of the shooting

2685
02:08:26,112 --> 02:08:26,624
We're actors

2686
02:08:27,136 --> 02:08:28,672
The question is

2687
02:08:28,928 --> 02:08:30,464
Is it before the Boston

2688
02:08:30,720 --> 02:08:31,744
Vomiting or because of

2689
02:08:32,256 --> 02:08:33,280
I was at

2690
02:08:33,792 --> 02:08:35,072
A substantial amount of money

2691
02:08:35,328 --> 02:08:37,120
Before

2692
02:08:37,376 --> 02:08:43,520
Just a week ago I would have said it's because it's crazy

2693
02:08:43,776 --> 02:08:49,920
Had a fun week of saying they were actors everywhere next episode

2694
02:08:50,432 --> 02:08:52,480
Stripes

2695
02:08:52,736 --> 02:08:54,784
Fresno

2696
02:08:55,040 --> 02:08:57,856
Like I don't have some Advanced information that I'm like

2697
02:08:58,112 --> 02:09:02,720
Hey is it going to be great when it does happen I have no idea

2698
02:09:02,976 --> 02:09:07,328
It could be a month after

2699
02:09:07,584 --> 02:09:11,680
It is entirely possible that our predictions will be wrong the moment we changed

2700
02:09:11,936 --> 02:09:12,448
The Protector

2701
02:09:12,960 --> 02:09:16,800
I'm actually course I'm going to say it's not until the Boston bombing

2702
02:09:17,312 --> 02:09:23,456
There is that there is not an observer effect

2703
02:09:23,712 --> 02:09:26,528
Measure it

2704
02:09:26,784 --> 02:09:28,064
Alright

2705
02:09:28,320 --> 02:09:32,160
I'm excited to see where that goes

2706
02:09:32,416 --> 02:09:33,696
Maybe a better way

2707
02:09:34,464 --> 02:09:37,536
2013 of the investigation episode

2708
02:09:37,792 --> 02:09:43,936
I have such a tendency to get down into the Weeds about learning about every piece of Alex's narrative

2709
02:09:45,472 --> 02:09:47,520
Whereas we are trying to

2710
02:09:47,776 --> 02:09:49,056
Understand the Sandy Hook stuff

2711
02:09:50,592 --> 02:09:52,128
It may not be in our best interest

2712
02:09:52,384 --> 02:09:58,528
Soulard every little thing about what Alex is up to it Mr. Those details

2713
02:09:59,040 --> 02:10:02,112
Just as excited as a coyote when Phyllis is on her lunch

2714
02:10:02,368 --> 02:10:06,720
Listen I would never deprive you of finding out about I got to give it up at this mall the Pirates

2715
02:10:07,744 --> 02:10:08,768
At the same time

2716
02:10:09,536 --> 02:10:13,120
We don't need to know about Alex's troubles at sxsw

2717
02:10:16,192 --> 02:10:19,264
I'm going to try as best as I can

2718
02:10:20,032 --> 02:10:20,800
When we do these

2719
02:10:21,312 --> 02:10:21,824
Investigations

2720
02:10:22,080 --> 02:10:22,592
In the future

2721
02:10:22,848 --> 02:10:23,616
Cover larger

2722
02:10:24,128 --> 02:10:26,176
I suppose Just One Day from the past

2723
02:10:26,432 --> 02:10:28,224
We need to make we need to make progress

2724
02:10:34,112 --> 02:10:37,696
I'm interested in the occupied stuff we'd say we're going to

2725
02:10:37,952 --> 02:10:40,768
To that there's this other.

2726
02:10:41,024 --> 02:10:41,536
So

2727
02:10:41,792 --> 02:10:47,936
On Wednesday with new episode website

02:10:49,216 --> 02:10:49,728

2730

Go to bed

2731

You could also

2735
02:11:05,856 --> 02:11:07,392
Conversely find yourself

2736
02:11:08,416 --> 02:11:09,696
Small family of coyote

2737
02:11:10,208 --> 02:11:15,328
None of them can be pregnant coyotes

2738
02:11:15,584 --> 02:11:17,888
Together have a little powwow with them

2739
02:11:18,400 --> 02:11:19,424
Steve what's going on

2740
02:11:19,680 --> 02:11:25,056
See what they're doing you know what they're going to say to you

02:11:27,104 --> 02:11:28,384
Oh yeah

2743
02:11:28,640 --> 02:11:29,152
Legend

2744
02:11:30,176 --> 02:11:30,688
The coyote

2745
02:11:31,456 --> 02:11:31,968
Knowledge fight

2746
02:11:34,272 --> 02:11:36,576
There's one coyote

2747
02:11:36,832 --> 02:11:38,880
Is the desert

2748
02:11:39,136 --> 02:11:40,160
New Mexico

2749
02:11:40,416 --> 02:11:41,952
If you find a coyote

2750
02:11:42,464 --> 02:11:42,976
It speaks

2751
02:11:43,232 --> 02:11:46,560
Is open its mouth

2752
02:11:48,096 --> 02:11:48,864
Absolutely

2753
02:11:49,120 --> 02:11:55,264
Butts

2754
02:11:55,776 --> 02:11:59,872
I am Leo

2755
02:12:01,664 --> 02:12:03,712
Holding
