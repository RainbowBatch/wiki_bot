00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:20,736
Nola.com

2
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:25,088
I have great respect for knowledge B

3
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,392
Sick of them posing as you're through the good guy

4
00:00:29,696 --> 00:00:34,048
Knowledge

5
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:55,552
Knowledge fight

6
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:07,584
Wendy

7
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:08,352
Jordans

8
00:01:08,608 --> 00:01:09,632
What up

9
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:11,936
Interesting

10
00:01:12,192 --> 00:01:15,776
For the week I work today is that

11
00:01:17,568 --> 00:01:19,872
The audience

12
00:01:20,128 --> 00:01:21,152
The show is so

13
00:01:21,408 --> 00:01:23,456
Engaged in productive ways

14
00:01:23,968 --> 00:01:27,296
Like last episode I discussed how I want to get a new animal friend

15
00:01:29,344 --> 00:01:34,976
And a couple about animals that might be in the running

16
00:01:35,232 --> 00:01:36,512
Thought through

17
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:37,792
But I got to eat

18
00:01:38,304 --> 00:01:39,072
Honda feedback

19
00:01:39,328 --> 00:01:41,632
From people about those options about like

20
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:43,424
Here's some of the drawbacks of those pets

21
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,960
And also a very bored

22
00:01:45,216 --> 00:01:51,360
Piece of feedback that is sugar gliders are not things you should know

23
00:01:53,664 --> 00:01:59,808
The table was necessarily like a leader in the clubhouse

24
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:00,832
Looking cute

25
00:02:02,112 --> 00:02:05,440
I think a lot of the possibilities in

26
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:11,584
Baby another cat

27
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:17,984
And that could be more productive use of my time so I want another animal friend to come around and play with me

28
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:26,176
Somebody sent me a message

29
00:02:26,432 --> 00:02:28,224
I don't remember your name

30
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,016
I sent this message

31
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:32,320
Kangaroo

32
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:36,672
And I immediately threw up and across the room

33
00:02:36,928 --> 00:02:41,536
Suggested to get like cockroaches

34
00:02:41,792 --> 00:02:44,608
No I can't do that

35
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:48,960
I don't want to

36
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:53,824
Terraria man

37
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:55,872
About

38
00:02:56,128 --> 00:02:57,152
Mantis

39
00:02:57,408 --> 00:02:58,176
Emancipated

40
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:10,976
Completely collapses you'll be able to make little

41
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:16,096
I don't think that's going to be in the cards

42
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:19,424
I think there's a lot of broad

43
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,216
Ramifications of their choice

44
00:03:21,472 --> 00:03:22,496
Animal friends

45
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:27,616
And I appreciate the audience

46
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:30,432
Making a good

47
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:32,480
Decision

48
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:34,272
Ludacris like I end up with

49
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:35,296
A wallaby

50
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,880
Jada Wilder service

51
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:45,792
Cute and lovely but at the same time be abusive for me to have never fallen

52
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:46,816
That trap so

53
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:48,352
I've always dreamt of getting a sock

54
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:49,120
Jackson those things are

55
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:49,888
You just can't

56
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,192
Yeah they don't

57
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:54,240
I don't think you're being squirrels

58
00:03:57,312 --> 00:04:03,456
Around my neck and I instantly have a personality

59
00:04:07,552 --> 00:04:08,064
So what about you

60
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:11,904
My brakes I have you ever seen the TV show alone

61
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:17,791
It's like a history it's like a survival show

62
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:26,239
Dijon

63
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:30,335
This show is you

64
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:35,967
They make these great little shelters like my partner and I were watching these just like

65
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:38,271
Other people watch HGTV

66
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:43,647
How do you make that a frame with all the boss on it that sounds amazing

67
00:04:43,903 --> 00:04:45,183
So I think

68
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:47,231
Survivor

69
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:52,863
If you would watch season 2 or so

70
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:56,191
I think season one is pretty good with season 2 is like what really

71
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:57,215
Grabbed me

72
00:04:57,471 --> 00:04:58,495
Possible

73
00:04:58,751 --> 00:05:01,823
I think you would have enjoyed seeing the ingenuity

74
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:03,871
I mean positive

75
00:05:04,127 --> 00:05:07,711
Cheated for for a fact

76
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:14,111
Got to be some of that

77
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:15,647
You would have really enjoyed

78
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:16,415
Survivors

79
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:22,815
Thanks

80
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:27,679
Religion alter star because

81
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:34,079
Subway

82
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:35,359
Colleges which are often like

83
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:37,919
Food

84
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:43,295
Everyone compete in a reward challenge

85
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:45,343
You know so they'll do that people

86
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:47,647
Early stars on Survivor

87
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:48,671
Picture of a step back

88
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:50,719
I feel so dystopian

89
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:53,791
But it's like if you watch a Japanese game show you like

90
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:57,631
Holy s*** I don't understand how we got to this place but I don't know what we're going to

91
00:05:57,887 --> 00:06:00,959
Controls

92
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:03,263
Challenging environment

93
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:06,847
All I will say Survivor got to control some of their concept

94
00:06:08,127 --> 00:06:11,711
The breakdown of the tribes in later seasons

95
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:13,503
It was troubling

96
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:19,903
Blue barracuda

97
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:23,487
Head

98
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:31,423
Most incompetent Temple guards

99
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:41,151
I don't remember who was that with it

100
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:43,711
Mike O'Malley's during appeal

101
00:06:44,223 --> 00:06:48,831
Beyond the generations he started out on Nickelodeon and then he got his own TV show and s***

102
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:50,111
Congratulations to Mike

103
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:51,391
Sure

104
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:52,415
Congratulations

105
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:58,815
Episode

Thanks Erik with a k

Next

113

Jenneke

114
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:33,375
Are you going around here today

115
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:39,775
Are you still throwing in some KKK I'm certainly not I'm just trying to spell people's names correctly

116
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:47,711
But Jenna

117
00:07:53,343 --> 00:07:54,367
Juvenile policy walk

118
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:59,999
Next Phillippe

119
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:05,119
Text Eric C

120
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:13,311
Next.

121
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:17,663
Alex M you're now a technocrat

122
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:29,439
Money off that heroin

123
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:44,799
Yes

124
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:46,591
The people who don't

125
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:48,639
You are right I mean there are

126
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:55,039
3 mm

127
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:57,087
There's no last initial

128
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:10,911
Okay so there's just

129
00:09:12,703 --> 00:09:13,471
Ibid

130
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:16,287
I don't think it is

131
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:20,639
Alright I feel very self-conscious about something

132
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:23,967
Scooby-Doo

133
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:26,271
Everybody gets I think so

134
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:28,063
I was just getting in my head

135
00:09:28,575 --> 00:09:31,647
Jordan

136
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:35,999
I was planning on trying to do Sunday episode

137
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:38,047
For this episode is wild

138
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:40,351
I get us as close to current as possible

139
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:44,703
This is too much going on on this episode and also

140
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:47,519
The flip a Sunday episode for a Monday podcast

141
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:49,055
Is Barry difficult

142
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:52,383
It requires us to record at like 8 or 9 at night

143
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:54,687
It's just I'm up all night

144
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:56,223
If I'm trying to get that episode

145
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:57,759
Turned around a time so

146
00:09:58,015 --> 00:10:02,623
Will be able to check in on that on our next episode on these here bones

147
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:05,183
Under the sea

148
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:10,303
By not to do with protests

149
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:12,095
Billy strange

150
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:18,495
House on Friday

151
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:20,031
Strange

152
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:26,175
So Alex starts off the show he wants to get back into the business with talking about

153
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:31,551
It's your right to argue that he's right about everything

154
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:37,439
They say how are you right

155
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:38,975
Every time

156
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:41,023
How did you know the Builder

157
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:48,447
You made it up

158
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:50,239
Search that it was a group

159
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:00,991
Recovery

160
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:04,063
Play those clips

161
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:06,879
News

162
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:12,767
Study

163
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:24,031
Gasp

164
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:26,335
Think about how big

165
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:29,919
About it

166
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:30,687
Alright

167
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:31,455
F*** off

168
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:38,111
One study that disagrees with him is retracted it's obviously a cover-up one steady that agrees with him is retracted its

169
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:42,975
Like I don't I don't need any

170
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:44,511
This one is now that it's

171
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:46,303
Retracted

172
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:52,703
That game is not making up

173
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:56,031
Do the Guardians report

174
00:11:56,287 --> 00:12:02,431
Never called

175
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:03,711
Treating covid-19

176
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:04,735
This was

177
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:08,831
The early studies

178
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:15,487
Chance of mortality

179
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:16,767
In covid-19

180
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:23,679
The reason that the authors were attracted the study was that they were basing their analysis on compiled by a company called

181
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:24,447
Surgisphere

182
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:25,983
Who's methods came under Quest

183
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:32,895
The others became concerned when surgisphere apparently was uncooperative the provided

184
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:35,199
Ultimately

185
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:42,111
Around the same time that this paper was rejected the New England Journal of Medicine that relied on data from surgisphere

186
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:44,415
But it was unrelated to hydroxychloroquine

187
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:46,463
This is clearly a story about

188
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:49,279
Statistical reliability more than it is about

189
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:51,583
Or anyone trying to attack Trump

190
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:56,447
Did you hear that the retraction is not the result of the data being shown to be inaccurate

191
00:12:56,703 --> 00:13:00,031
Just that the authors are no longer convinced he's reliable

192
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:01,055
Which are different things

193
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:05,151
It may be the case that the underlying data is bad

194
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:08,223
Or it may be fine but since they can't stand behind it

195
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:13,087
Outlets

196
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:20,767
I can find concrete connections between surgisphere and Bill Gates nor between Gates and surgisphere zoner

197
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:22,047
Sepang beside

198
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:26,143
So unless Alex can substantiate that I assume he's just making it up

199
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:33,055
Another thing to keep in mind is that no matter what the reality is with this study getting rejected it has no effect on

200
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:34,847
Responsible Trump was being what he promoted

201
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:36,127
The drug is a potential miracle

202
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:36,895
Procure

203
00:13:37,151 --> 00:13:38,687
You would have all science came back

204
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:41,759
It did say that it was a perfect cure for covid-19

205
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:45,087
Trump had absolutely no reason to say what he did

206
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:46,623
Which is the problem

207
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:47,903
And finally

208
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:51,231
Alex is completely wrong about the study's referencing

209
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:57,631
He's just read a few headlines about early studies that showed promise you no like as a hundred percent

210
00:13:57,887 --> 00:13:59,935
They just decided to look no further into it

211
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:04,287
There's plenty of other studies that have shown like you shouldn't be giving this to people

212
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:09,407
On June 3rd of Derry rigorously controlled study was published in the New England Journal of Medicine would show.

213
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:13,759
Malaria drug hydroxychloroquine did not help prevent people with vinegar

214
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:17,087
Exposed to others of covid-19 from developing the disease

215
00:14:17,855 --> 00:14:22,207
This is the first double-blind randomized placebo-controlled study that's been done on the subject

216
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:26,047
Amy found that the drug had a copper elbow effect to a placebo

217
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:32,191
On June 5th is reported on a clinical trial that had just wrapped up in the UK

218
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:36,287
One of the Weeds on that study and Oxford epidemiologist said

219
00:14:36,799 --> 00:14:39,615
Today's preliminary results from the recovery trial are quite

220
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:44,735
Clear hydroxychloroquine does not reduce the risk of death among hospitalized patients with this

221
00:14:44,991 --> 00:14:46,015
New disease

222
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:52,671
Some of the new day we're seeing or tending towards the impression

223
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:56,511
There's also no medical reason to prescribe for covid-19

224
00:14:57,023 --> 00:15:02,143
Studies are showing that it's not have a significant effect on recovery

225
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:05,727
There are other studies that are looking at other aspects of the drugs possible

226
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:08,543
Applications interactions with covid-19

227
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:10,079
But it doesn't look like there's anything

228
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:16,479
Particularly promising here at this point making the presidency

229
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:18,271
Listen to prescribe drugs

230
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:20,063
Will you put it that way

231
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:26,463
I bet Alex would argue that

232
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:31,327
President

233
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:33,631
I probably would make

234
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:40,287
I guess what I was doing here as he's trying to claim a major win or a victory in hindsight

235
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:45,407
Trump may not have been advocating for people to take an unnecessary medication that might kill her

236
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:51,807
Well it sounds really bad

237
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:55,391
Is there a medication that has a smoke

238
00:15:55,647 --> 00:15:56,415
What are gyros

239
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:57,695
Claire victory

240
00:15:57,951 --> 00:15:58,975
Mission accomplished

241
00:15:59,231 --> 00:16:02,047
Chanterelle mushrooms

242
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:05,375
Very interesting approach

243
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:08,447
Did that

244
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:13,311
Because of these complicated reasons involving

245
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:16,383
Uncertainty around the sourcing of this

246
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:18,687
And Alex is going to report that

247
00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:22,527
All of everything about covid-19

248
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:26,879
Also Bill Gates is involved

249
00:16:27,135 --> 00:16:28,415
This particular retract

250
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:30,719
Which I can find no evidence

251
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:34,047
Surgisphere does have a kind of evil name to accompany

252
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:38,655
The medical companies probably have things that are

253
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:41,471
Sort of similarly

254
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:44,799
What are the chief problems about this is that

255
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:47,615
As Alex talks more about the story

256
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:50,687
Attractions

257
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:52,223
He doesn't know anything about the

258
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:55,551
How much did

259
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:01,439
Otherwise none

260
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:02,463
Bill Gates

261
00:17:07,327 --> 00:17:08,095
7 trillion

262
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:10,911
The story is

263
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:13,983
He's just read a headline about them and now he's Off to the Races

264
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:19,871
He doesn't know what the other journals that retracted their study was which was the New England Journal of Medicine

265
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:21,151
Further he doesn't

266
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:25,247
What that New England Journal medicine paper was about

267
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:28,831
I was acting like it was about hydroxychloroquine but it wasn't

268
00:17:29,087 --> 00:17:31,391
And you would know that if you knew anything about this story

269
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:37,023
The study that was retracted from the New England Journal of Medicine was based on data also provided by surgisphere

270
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:39,327
But it was looking at the possible interaction

271
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:41,887
Between covid-19 and blood pressure medication

272
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:47,263
Is the major variable nested Alec seems completely unaware of which is troubling

273
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:53,151
Anyone acting innocent Seer capacity would never report on a story like this with such a little knowledge about the topic

274
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:54,687
Does this all the time

275
00:17:55,199 --> 00:18:00,831
He gets like two or three details and then just mix up the rest in a way that generally fits his propaganda angle

276
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:02,111
We just called lion

277
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:06,463
A second major thing that Alex is making up in the story of how these retractions happen

278
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:12,351
He's pretending that public pushback was responsible for getting the researchers to retract that's not at all what hap

279
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:14,143
In reality

280
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:20,543
There are some questions that experts and news media brought question the particular provided by

281
00:18:21,311 --> 00:18:26,431
What are the major things that happened was as you mentioned the guardian reported on May 28th

282
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:30,783
Researchers in Australia review

283
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:33,599
Did 73 deaths from covid-19 in the country

284
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:37,439
At that point when there was actually only 67 official.

285
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:41,535
This set off alarm just exactly the state was coming from

286
00:18:42,047 --> 00:18:46,911
The Australian researchers contacted Lancet contacted the study's authors for clarification

287
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:49,983
Requested surgisphere authenticate their data

288
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:52,031
To make matters more suspicious

289
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:54,847
The pain beside the head of surgisphere

290
00:18:55,103 --> 00:18:56,383
Quotes

291
00:18:56,895 --> 00:19:00,479
Accidentally been included in the Australian

292
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:01,759
From there

293
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:03,807
You can't rely on this data unless it's audited

294
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:06,879
And studies that relied on it has to be retracted

295
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:08,415
Which is why those two were

296
00:19:09,183 --> 00:19:15,327
Absolutely nothing to do with public backlash it had to do with Australian researchers attempting to conduct a study

297
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:17,119
Who found an irregularity

298
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:20,959
And then the attempt to sort it out uncovered a possible instance of shoddy

299
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:26,079
This honestly should give people a lot more confidence

300
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:27,615
The numbers that were seen

301
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:30,687
Because it's such a great example of scientific self-policing

302
00:19:31,199 --> 00:19:37,343
People conducting This research pour over the data and discrepancies sit there

303
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:41,695
Yeah he's a good guy

304
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:48,095
Underlying data

305
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:49,631
It's not clear really

306
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:54,751
Absence of data

307
00:19:55,007 --> 00:20:00,383
Poorly organized and regulated data which renders it unreliable to be used for professional analysis

308
00:20:01,151 --> 00:20:04,223
That's not the same thing as having no data or just being made of

309
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:09,343
The case of this Asian / Australian hospital that was found in the data

310
00:20:09,855 --> 00:20:11,135
That could well be a mistake

311
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:17,535
But they made in terms of archiving the data and possibly if you remove the hospital from Australia

312
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:18,559
He's in set of numbers

313
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:21,119
The numbers might match official number

314
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:25,727
Very well may be the case but even if it is you still have to retract

315
00:20:25,983 --> 00:20:27,007
Because of the possibility

316
00:20:27,263 --> 00:20:31,359
Of other unexamined problems being there in the data would pop up later

317
00:20:32,127 --> 00:20:38,271
So you're saying Ashley looking over their own data sets in order to refine their information and

318
00:20:38,527 --> 00:20:41,599
Use it more effectively in the way that they're doing

319
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:44,159
I really think that sounds like a cover-up to

320
00:20:45,951 --> 00:20:51,839
Is dr. Allen chin infectious disease doctor in Australia told the guardian

321
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:54,655
If they got that wrong what else could be wrong

322
00:20:54,911 --> 00:20:56,703
In terms of the surgisphere dataset

323
00:20:57,215 --> 00:21:03,359
A mistake like that taints a set of data because it introduces far too much on reliability and uncertainty so using it is

324
00:21:03,615 --> 00:21:05,663
Is essentially like trying to build a house on Sam

325
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:11,807
There are some indications that are coming out the points in the direction that decide may have a history of fabrication

326
00:21:12,319 --> 00:21:15,135
As BuzzFeed reported on June 6th

327
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:18,464
Publix

328
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,744
In 2004

329
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,816
Is part of his Graduate Studies at the University of Illinois Chicago

330
00:21:23,584 --> 00:21:27,424
Have some instances of duplication and images used

331
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:28,192
Which is a no no

332
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,752
A computer scientist they talked to said

333
00:21:31,008 --> 00:21:33,056
It's like the guy went crazy with Photoshop

334
00:21:33,568 --> 00:21:37,408
And went on to say quote I've never seen something like this it's outrageous

335
00:21:39,968 --> 00:21:45,600
That being said that alone is not proof that the dataset that surgisphere was using was fabricated or made up

336
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:49,184
These indications of past malfeasance introduced that possibility

337
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:52,512
But it still needs to be proven which I have not seen up till this point

338
00:21:53,024 --> 00:21:59,168
It might happen in the future but was made-up is an indication that he doesn't understand

339
00:21:59,424 --> 00:22:00,960
Reporting he's kind of just wings

340
00:22:01,216 --> 00:22:02,240
Well you know who works

341
00:22:02,496 --> 00:22:03,008
Surgisphere

342
00:22:04,288 --> 00:22:06,080
It's a Polish or in the Lesser Baldwin

343
00:22:08,384 --> 00:22:14,528
Cobalt

344
00:22:14,784 --> 00:22:16,832
I don't remember

345
00:22:17,088 --> 00:22:18,624
I don't know my Baldwin

346
00:22:19,136 --> 00:22:25,280
So the fourth problem is again Alex

347
00:22:26,048 --> 00:22:32,192
If Alex wants to make the story about Bill Gates

348
00:22:32,448 --> 00:22:33,216
Understand the basics

349
00:22:33,472 --> 00:22:33,984
The story

350
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,776
He's ever going to

351
00:22:36,544 --> 00:22:42,688
The Gates Foundation in the Declaration of Interest section

352
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:46,016
Which would have been done if they've been involved in the study or responding

353
00:22:46,528 --> 00:22:49,088
I need a citation here if Alex wants me to take her seriously

354
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,368
Not going to happen

355
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:51,392
So I'm not going

356
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,696
Bill Gates

357
00:22:54,208 --> 00:22:54,720
Create

358
00:22:54,976 --> 00:22:56,256
The popularity of

359
00:22:56,512 --> 00:22:58,048
Photoshop witch

360
00:22:58,304 --> 00:22:59,072
Guy used

361
00:22:59,584 --> 00:23:02,656
Trick people on his graduates.

362
00:23:02,912 --> 00:23:07,520
I would love for Alex. Do that sounds amazing

363
00:23:07,776 --> 00:23:09,824
Demonstration of how poorly thanks

364
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:21,344
I need to have a little chat with you about

365
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:25,696
A method of lying and a method of analysis that Alex does

366
00:23:26,208 --> 00:23:28,000
Clear enough.

367
00:23:28,256 --> 00:23:28,768
The past

368
00:23:29,024 --> 00:23:29,792
Bloomberg

369
00:23:39,264 --> 00:23:40,288
Funded

370
00:23:42,848 --> 00:23:44,384
That's amazing

371
00:23:45,664 --> 00:23:51,808
Nowhere in the Lancet article Business Insider article

372
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:57,952
You just making that up because he doesn't care to understand the actual story and just wants to make things fit

373
00:23:58,976 --> 00:23:59,744
This is important

374
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:06,144
Because Alex is directly asserting that Lancet is reporting that the study of the total and was funded by Bill Gates

375
00:24:06,656 --> 00:24:07,936
That statement is a lie

376
00:24:08,192 --> 00:24:11,520
Alex is actually doing

377
00:24:12,544 --> 00:24:15,872
When I was in college I was drawn toward the study of ancient things

378
00:24:16,384 --> 00:24:22,272
I dabbled in anthropology and religious studies before I landed on the ill-advised path I ended up taking

379
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:25,344
I have a degree with basically for minors instead of one major

380
00:24:26,112 --> 00:24:28,416
Is the cost of being indecisive you end up having

381
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:33,280
Start a podcast about Alex Jones when you grow up

382
00:24:33,536 --> 00:24:39,680
My advisor in college did not warn me of this bike

383
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:43,264
I kind of felt like a famous stand-up

384
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,568
I wasn't

385
00:24:45,824 --> 00:24:50,688
Just imagine my high school guidance counselor college hours story as like a

386
00:24:50,944 --> 00:24:51,968
Cautionary Tale

387
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:57,856
Do you want to start a podcast about a lunatic

388
00:24:59,904 --> 00:25:06,048
My religious studies classes are the concepts of exegesis and eisegesis

389
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:07,328
Styles of textual criticism

390
00:25:08,096 --> 00:25:14,240
Engages in exegesis attempts to understand the text that's in front of them and understand that text to a number

391
00:25:14,496 --> 00:25:15,264
Applied contact

392
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,032
Text

393
00:25:16,288 --> 00:25:21,152
The prism of understanding a text in terms of historical events happening around

394
00:25:21,408 --> 00:25:21,920
Writing

395
00:25:22,176 --> 00:25:23,968
Another school of exegesis used

396
00:25:24,224 --> 00:25:26,272
The text itself is divinely-inspired

397
00:25:26,528 --> 00:25:31,392
It does studies a text in the context that there's a meeting beyond the original author intended

398
00:25:31,648 --> 00:25:32,928
But it's still a study of the

399
00:25:34,208 --> 00:25:39,840
There's a lot of different views on exegesis but all of it is studying within a framework and all the things

400
00:25:40,096 --> 00:25:41,632
From the text to study

401
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,960
The opposite of his practice is called eisegesis

402
00:25:45,216 --> 00:25:48,800
Which is when it's something serious.

403
00:25:49,568 --> 00:25:50,080
Strongly

404
00:25:50,848 --> 00:25:55,200
Someone who engages and eisegesis is someone approaches a text for a reason

405
00:25:55,456 --> 00:25:55,968
Anderson

406
00:25:56,224 --> 00:25:57,504
Define supplicant demonstrates

407
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,040
Conclusion they already have

408
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:03,904
An exegesis you rely on things to take out of the text inform your study

409
00:26:04,416 --> 00:26:05,952
Where is an eisegesis

410
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:08,768
Text

411
00:26:09,024 --> 00:26:12,096
And are bringing that point to the text itself to defend your point

412
00:26:12,608 --> 00:26:13,632
It's a dangerous cracked

413
00:26:13,888 --> 00:26:20,032
Just because it allows you to misuse primary sources and take small passages out of appropriate context to make whatever point

414
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:21,312
Incline to make anyway

415
00:26:21,568 --> 00:26:22,592
But you're pretending

416
00:26:22,848 --> 00:26:26,432
Figuring gauging with Source material and that's what led you to your conclusion

417
00:26:26,688 --> 00:26:29,504
It's a bastardized version to study

418
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:30,784
Are you sure they

419
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:33,344
Missy Missy cuz what I hear is

420
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,624
It's one of those is exigence

421
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:40,000
This isn't one of those is fun

422
00:26:40,256 --> 00:26:44,096
I like believe what I believe and not worrying about what other people

423
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:48,448
People say I will save it in my life that are disciplined are typically last

424
00:26:51,008 --> 00:26:54,592
Is why I have it for my Hearthstone

425
00:26:55,360 --> 00:27:01,504
Exegesis and eisegesis art in relation to biblical criticism

426
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,296
Apply to basically all sorts of

427
00:27:03,552 --> 00:27:04,320
Text Roland Allison

428
00:27:05,344 --> 00:27:08,416
The person who engages in rampant eisegesis

429
00:27:08,672 --> 00:27:13,792
The other point that he intends to make and he picks various headlines that he thinks things will reinforce his point

430
00:27:14,048 --> 00:27:18,656
As opposed to reading the news in forming conclusions based on the information that comes to him

431
00:27:18,912 --> 00:27:19,680
About reality

432
00:27:20,192 --> 00:27:22,240
A lot of conspiracy-minded people do this

433
00:27:22,496 --> 00:27:27,104
Since eisegesis is a practice that essentially it's just a pastor confirmation bias

434
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,640
You go looking for something

435
00:27:28,896 --> 00:27:33,504
And if you're lazy enough of a researcher

436
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:35,552
But there's a decent chance it won't be real

437
00:27:36,576 --> 00:27:39,392
Seen happen here with this new story that Alex is covering

438
00:27:39,904 --> 00:27:46,048
He's already decided everything about covid-19 is a hoax so he's bringing that to his reading of this story when the actual texted no

439
00:27:46,304 --> 00:27:46,816
No way support sis

440
00:27:47,072 --> 00:27:47,584
Conclusion

441
00:27:48,096 --> 00:27:49,376
The only way he could arrive at that can

442
00:27:49,632 --> 00:27:51,168
Conclusion

443
00:27:51,424 --> 00:27:51,936
Conclusion to the T

444
00:27:52,192 --> 00:27:52,960
Text with him

445
00:27:53,216 --> 00:27:53,984
Which is inappropriate

446
00:27:54,752 --> 00:27:58,592
Does this all the time and I generally just say he's lying or making things up

447
00:27:58,848 --> 00:28:03,712
I thought this was a particularly good example of his specific behavior

448
00:28:03,968 --> 00:28:06,784
Explaining this precise technique that uses

449
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:09,088
Do you understand this a little bit better you

450
00:28:09,344 --> 00:28:11,904
Can see it pop up in so many insta

451
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:14,208
Symptoms of Alex very regular

452
00:28:14,464 --> 00:28:16,512
Technique that if he'd actually learn

453
00:28:16,768 --> 00:28:17,280
Things

454
00:28:17,792 --> 00:28:20,096
In his younger years about how to engage

455
00:28:20,352 --> 00:28:21,632
Write with different text

456
00:28:21,888 --> 00:28:22,656
Differently

457
00:28:22,912 --> 00:28:23,936
He probably wouldn't

458
00:28:24,192 --> 00:28:25,216
Fall into

459
00:28:25,472 --> 00:28:27,520
I don't even want to call so

460
00:28:28,032 --> 00:28:28,544
It's so

461
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,080
Intentional

462
00:28:31,104 --> 00:28:33,152
Like I said Jesus isn't necessarily

463
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,272
Engagement

464
00:28:38,784 --> 00:28:44,928
Or a lot of a lot of creative nonfiction

465
00:28:45,184 --> 00:28:48,512
ReliOn the reader bringing something to the text to engage with

466
00:28:49,024 --> 00:28:50,048
It's it's the it's the

467
00:28:50,304 --> 00:28:51,328
The Forum

468
00:28:51,584 --> 00:28:54,656
It is more appropriate for those

469
00:28:54,912 --> 00:28:56,192
The one you're talking about

470
00:28:56,448 --> 00:28:58,240
We're talking about

471
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:02,336
Factual based things are primary sources

472
00:29:02,592 --> 00:29:03,104
Document

473
00:29:03,616 --> 00:29:04,128
It's just

474
00:29:04,384 --> 00:29:06,176
Responsible thing

475
00:29:06,432 --> 00:29:06,944
To engage

476
00:29:07,456 --> 00:29:09,504
Yeah as my age

477
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:13,344
Somebody who's gone to five colleges in still doesn't even have a single degree

478
00:29:13,856 --> 00:29:16,416
Most of most of those were all in literature

479
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:21,024
Not that conversation in so many different classes about like

480
00:29:21,536 --> 00:29:22,816
Authorial intent versus

481
00:29:24,352 --> 00:29:27,424
Always some people who are in the any of those classes

482
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:28,192
Just like

483
00:29:28,448 --> 00:29:31,776
I refuse to even bother picking up a history book

484
00:29:32,032 --> 00:29:34,848
About what was going on

485
00:29:35,104 --> 00:29:37,920
What he was obviously writing about was whatever it is

486
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:39,200
That I wish you would

487
00:29:39,968 --> 00:29:41,248
And it happened every time

488
00:29:46,112 --> 00:29:46,624
Conviction

489
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:50,720
End

490
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,560
You know looking at a piece of even

491
00:29:54,816 --> 00:29:57,376
Fiction within the context of

492
00:29:57,632 --> 00:30:01,472
What could think be allegories for based on the live experience of the author

493
00:30:01,984 --> 00:30:05,056
It's a different approach to it

494
00:30:05,312 --> 00:30:06,336
Typically

495
00:30:06,592 --> 00:30:11,712
Especially when covering topics that are similar to the one that Alex is

496
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,016
Jesus is just like

497
00:30:14,272 --> 00:30:15,808
A completely inappropriate

498
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:18,112
And flawed way to engage with

499
00:30:18,624 --> 00:30:19,136
Material

500
00:30:19,392 --> 00:30:19,904
You're going to

501
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,184
End up lying

502
00:30:21,952 --> 00:30:28,096
Intentionally you're going to end up lying intentionally everything is going to be disconnected from reality

503
00:30:28,352 --> 00:30:30,144
Cuz every story is only going to

504
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:32,448
Really be depiction of what you

505
00:30:32,704 --> 00:30:35,008
Think and feel

506
00:30:36,032 --> 00:30:36,544
Pointless

507
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,592
I can only

508
00:30:38,848 --> 00:30:43,200
For when I see Jesus isn't

509
00:30:43,456 --> 00:30:46,784
Reality

510
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:48,320
I like the.

511
00:30:49,344 --> 00:30:53,184
Did you ever read that well the author just goes through in

512
00:30:53,696 --> 00:30:58,816
Like tries to explain taoism and Buddhism by using these characters in The Way They Were

513
00:30:59,072 --> 00:31:00,352
They interact as like

514
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:01,632
But he's not saying

515
00:31:02,144 --> 00:31:03,680
It was a clearly Buddhist

516
00:31:03,936 --> 00:31:05,472
Series of books

517
00:31:05,728 --> 00:31:08,800
Books trying to explain something

518
00:31:09,056 --> 00:31:12,128
More like an application thing

519
00:31:12,384 --> 00:31:14,688
That applies

520
00:31:15,712 --> 00:31:17,504
I think about it more so I have it rented out

521
00:31:18,528 --> 00:31:20,320
Read books

522
00:31:20,576 --> 00:31:22,368
That like everyone tells me to read

523
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:25,184
Tabaxi

524
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:31,584
Little Miss Sunshine

525
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,376
You're not missing any

526
00:31:33,632 --> 00:31:34,144
You're fine

527
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:36,960
Thank you can live without those movies

528
00:31:37,216 --> 00:31:37,984
I promise you

529
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:44,640
Further into you know anti-vaccine

530
00:31:44,896 --> 00:31:45,664
Denialism

531
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:47,200
And stuff and

532
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:48,992
Making stuff up

533
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,576
Butcher Boys

534
00:31:55,392 --> 00:31:55,904
Told by

535
00:31:58,720 --> 00:31:59,232
Not

536
00:32:00,256 --> 00:32:00,768
Public

537
00:32:05,376 --> 00:32:05,888
People are still

538
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:09,472
So I

539
00:32:09,728 --> 00:32:15,104
Ian Hayden

540
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:16,384
It discusses adverse

541
00:32:17,152 --> 00:32:17,664
I'm ready

542
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:21,504
Bunch of stories about this dude and literally none of them back up without the same

543
00:32:22,272 --> 00:32:23,808
Here Alex is presenting to climb

544
00:32:24,064 --> 00:32:24,832
First

545
00:32:27,136 --> 00:32:30,976
Bill Gates of Gates Foundation told him not to come forward

546
00:32:31,744 --> 00:32:34,560
An article in the New York Post clearly says quote

547
00:32:34,816 --> 00:32:38,144
He also insisted that is sick as he was it was never life-threatening

548
00:32:40,448 --> 00:32:42,752
They're over and it back to Marathon run

549
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:49,664
No Outlet interviewed him seems to be reporting that Ian almost died unless you allow for a very very broad reading of

550
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:50,688
Almost died

551
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:55,040
Princeton Post article discusses how his girlfriend was there to catch him when he

552
00:32:55,296 --> 00:32:55,808
He fainted

553
00:32:56,064 --> 00:32:59,648
So you can make a disingenuous argument that if he'd fainted in the wrong place and she was

554
00:32:59,904 --> 00:33:01,184
Barry could have been fatal

555
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,720
That's a stretch for the type of Art

556
00:33:02,976 --> 00:33:03,488
Alex is trying

557
00:33:03,744 --> 00:33:05,024
Except

558
00:33:05,792 --> 00:33:06,304
Again

559
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:07,840
This is eisegesis

560
00:33:08,352 --> 00:33:12,704
Alex wants the story to be that these vaccines are killing people to the story

561
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,752
It completely Alters the way he reports it

562
00:33:15,264 --> 00:33:18,336
You makes up details and embellish his things in order to match his narrative

563
00:33:18,592 --> 00:33:19,616
Because it's not important

564
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:20,640
To discuss reality

565
00:33:21,152 --> 00:33:22,176
It's crucial to Warp

566
00:33:22,432 --> 00:33:24,480
Reality to match the predetermined narrative

567
00:33:25,248 --> 00:33:30,624
As for the second claim the Bill Gates told I can find no evidence of this claim

568
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:33,952
And it's a responsibility to prove it or admit

569
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:40,864
I checked out his Twitter account needs very supportive still love the vaccine he was a part of the trial for

570
00:33:41,632 --> 00:33:46,752
At the end of May he retweeted a modern announcement that they were entering Phase 2 trial

571
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:53,408
It seems like he's mostly interested in coming forward to demystify the phenomenon of adverse

572
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:56,224
I think is pretty admirable

573
00:33:56,736 --> 00:34:02,880
Alex wants the story to be the Bill Gates is somehow threatened by Ian coming forward because Alex thinks that all the media.

574
00:34:03,136 --> 00:34:05,184
Medicines can sometimes

575
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:06,720
Adverse reactions

576
00:34:06,976 --> 00:34:07,744
For the people

577
00:34:08,256 --> 00:34:09,536
That premise is faulty

578
00:34:13,888 --> 00:34:14,912
Well what's your missing here

579
00:34:15,168 --> 00:34:15,680
Here is what act

580
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,240
Is he was standing out by

581
00:34:18,496 --> 00:34:20,288
Behind the semi truck

582
00:34:20,544 --> 00:34:22,080
That had the Box

583
00:34:24,128 --> 00:34:24,640
Dolly

584
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:25,664
Not the Box

585
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:26,688
What is the vaccine on it

586
00:34:26,944 --> 00:34:32,832
Almost hit him in the head so we almost got killed by the vaccine and then bill

587
00:34:33,856 --> 00:34:34,880
And you know how that's proof

588
00:34:35,136 --> 00:34:41,280
If you didn't tell anybody about that mix-up you know what I heard actually mostly moves

589
00:34:41,536 --> 00:34:42,816
Vaccines by way of

590
00:34:43,072 --> 00:34:47,680
Pianos on strings

591
00:34:47,936 --> 00:34:51,776
Situation where a piano that cleans NFL on it

592
00:34:52,544 --> 00:34:58,688
Similar thing he was keeping a bunch of vaccines about Apple cards and all that stuff as they walked by slowly

593
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:05,344
In reality the gates people the scientist at moderna probably have no problem telling a story

594
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:08,160
Better understanding about clinical trials work

595
00:35:08,672 --> 00:35:11,232
Things get tweak does trials progress

596
00:35:11,488 --> 00:35:13,024
That's not brightening

597
00:35:13,536 --> 00:35:19,680
Princeton in the press release that Ian retweeted from moderna they discussed their initial dosing in face

598
00:35:19,936 --> 00:35:20,704
And guess what

599
00:35:21,216 --> 00:35:25,056
They completely eliminated the top dose which was 250 micrograms

600
00:35:25,568 --> 00:35:29,408
From the trials because the information they collected Indians round of tests

601
00:35:30,176 --> 00:35:34,272
3 people in the 250 microgram group had self-dissolving

602
00:35:34,528 --> 00:35:35,296
Adverse effect

603
00:35:35,552 --> 00:35:36,064
From the back

604
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:39,904
Researchers to learn

605
00:35:40,416 --> 00:35:42,208
So the new trials are focusing on

606
00:35:42,464 --> 00:35:46,304
Placebo 50 microgram dose and a 100 mg dose

607
00:35:47,328 --> 00:35:52,704
They learned from the first round but the difference between 100 and 250 microgram wasn't relevant to terms

608
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:04,480
People engage with these sorts of things in terms of reality understand that this is a process

609
00:36:05,248 --> 00:36:06,016
Asurion wasn't

610
00:36:06,272 --> 00:36:08,320
Got a bad fever and fainted

611
00:36:08,576 --> 00:36:14,720
But I'm also sure that research is gather essential information about how to proceed creating a bags

612
00:36:14,976 --> 00:36:16,512
It's safest for everyone

613
00:36:17,024 --> 00:36:20,352
And further the researchers and moderna and Bill Gates

614
00:36:20,608 --> 00:36:23,168
I don't look at you in telling the story of the huge negative

615
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:26,496
They have to report on Adverse Events anyway

616
00:36:26,752 --> 00:36:29,568
So those numbers were released prior to eating coming forward

617
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:33,152
Does it put the human face on that number

618
00:36:33,408 --> 00:36:34,432
Human face

619
00:36:34,688 --> 00:36:40,320
Pretty publicly saying what the side effect wasn't

620
00:36:40,576 --> 00:36:43,136
And that he's glad that he was a part of the study and he still believes in

621
00:36:43,904 --> 00:36:48,256
I don't know how that's a negative for Bill Gates it's insane to me

622
00:36:48,512 --> 00:36:50,816
That bet this point of view that Alex

623
00:36:51,072 --> 00:36:52,352
Is expressing is fake

624
00:36:52,608 --> 00:36:57,472
His hatred and distrust of a company trying to make a vaccine and part of that trial

625
00:36:57,984 --> 00:36:59,776
Is putting small group

626
00:37:00,288 --> 00:37:01,312
Together getting

627
00:37:01,568 --> 00:37:04,384
Clean and then getting that data in order to refine it and

628
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:05,152
Ben

629
00:37:05,408 --> 00:37:06,944
Pass it on to a larger group

630
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:07,968
That's the idea

631
00:37:08,224 --> 00:37:10,528
Not somebody coming out and just saying

632
00:37:10,784 --> 00:37:12,064
We've got the vaccine

633
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:13,344
Everyone taken

634
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:19,744
Without trying it without testing it without doing anything like that

635
00:37:20,256 --> 00:37:26,400
Santa Cruz

636
00:37:26,656 --> 00:37:32,800
Would you took the guys just like I do this over the people

637
00:37:33,056 --> 00:37:39,200
Lumos fictionalized version

638
00:37:39,712 --> 00:37:41,760
Through misusing primary sources

639
00:37:42,016 --> 00:37:45,344
In order to provide a foundation in a basis

640
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:47,392
People who don't pay attention

641
00:37:47,648 --> 00:37:48,160
Yeah

642
00:37:48,416 --> 00:37:49,184
So

643
00:37:49,696 --> 00:37:50,208
Yep

644
00:37:50,464 --> 00:37:54,560
So his next big story actually pretty exciting

645
00:37:54,816 --> 00:37:55,840
And fun

646
00:37:56,096 --> 00:37:57,376
To look into a little bit

647
00:37:59,936 --> 00:38:00,448
And guess what

648
00:38:02,496 --> 00:38:03,008
2 days ago

649
00:38:14,016 --> 00:38:14,784
But you talked about 9

650
00:38:16,832 --> 00:38:17,344
This is coming

651
00:38:19,136 --> 00:38:19,648
Now is

652
00:38:20,928 --> 00:38:21,440
Reset

653
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:27,072
With the UN imf-world Bank

654
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:28,352
Control

655
00:38:31,168 --> 00:38:31,680
Excuse

656
00:38:35,776 --> 00:38:36,544
They say it

657
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:37,312
Exactly

658
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:40,128
Wonderful

659
00:38:40,896 --> 00:38:43,712
Rothschild

660
00:38:44,736 --> 00:38:46,016
Digital money back

661
00:38:47,296 --> 00:38:47,808
How we Livin

662
00:38:48,832 --> 00:38:51,136
Your Lifestyles never going to be the same but it's

663
00:38:51,904 --> 00:38:52,416
The best

664
00:38:54,464 --> 00:38:55,232
Permission to travel

665
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:56,512
Officially

666
00:38:56,768 --> 00:38:57,280
From the day

667
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:06,496
Go to hear them come back up in Forever

668
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:13,152
Reading this report

669
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:19,040
I strongly suspect that he saying he read it because it's completely unbelievable

670
00:39:19,552 --> 00:39:23,136
She's trying to make a slightly lesser claim in order to make it sound more plausible

671
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:27,232
A man who claimed to be

672
00:39:27,488 --> 00:39:33,632
Furious it mostly read it that still puts well over four

673
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,960
My reasons

674
00:39:37,984 --> 00:39:42,080
One I cannot find any 100-page report

675
00:39:44,128 --> 00:39:50,272
3 page synopsis appears to just be an op-ed on the world economic forum's website with that line

676
00:39:50,784 --> 00:39:52,576
Now is the time for a great reset

677
00:39:53,088 --> 00:39:56,160
It's not a synopsis is just an iPad about a larger idea

678
00:39:58,464 --> 00:40:04,608
For covering this story just links to the world economic forum

679
00:40:04,864 --> 00:40:06,144
Comic forums article

680
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:10,496
Provide attribution for

681
00:40:10,752 --> 00:40:14,080
World economic forum

682
00:40:14,336 --> 00:40:19,968
Which is a copyright free photo service

683
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:22,528
If any pictures under copyright he could get into trouble

684
00:40:22,784 --> 00:40:24,576
For stealing intellectual property without permission

685
00:40:24,832 --> 00:40:25,344
Generac rebutia

686
00:40:27,648 --> 00:40:30,464
So Alex is making up the stuff he says about what's in the report

687
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:35,072
That's not in the op-ed which is mostly about how the situation

688
00:40:35,328 --> 00:40:39,424
Tends toward a very rare opportunity to reshape the world for the better

689
00:40:40,192 --> 00:40:43,008
This involves steering the market George Fair outcome

690
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:49,664
Ensuring investment Advanced shared goals such as sustainability

691
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:50,944
You support the public

692
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:53,504
Especially by addressing Health and Social Challenges

693
00:40:54,016 --> 00:40:56,064
You can read into that whatever you like insurance

694
00:40:56,320 --> 00:41:02,464
It's probably sensible to be a little suspicious of the world economic forum

695
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:04,000
Is disconnected from reality

696
00:41:04,512 --> 00:41:06,304
Again he's engaging and eisegesis

697
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:07,584
Is it bad practice

698
00:41:08,096 --> 00:41:09,120
Yeah it's

699
00:41:10,656 --> 00:41:12,448
I like the world

700
00:41:12,704 --> 00:41:16,800
Place where they're saying all this stuff but at the end of the day for their Solutions probably like

701
00:41:17,056 --> 00:41:20,128
And that's why private Equity Funds need to own a business

702
00:41:24,736 --> 00:41:26,272
This is

703
00:41:26,784 --> 00:41:30,880
What's the closest thing that I can come up to with this 100-page report

704
00:41:31,136 --> 00:41:32,416
Interactive issues map

705
00:41:32,672 --> 00:41:35,232
The world economic forum's website

706
00:41:35,488 --> 00:41:36,000
The great reset

707
00:41:36,256 --> 00:41:36,768
That sounds fun

708
00:41:37,024 --> 00:41:42,656
I strongly suspect for a membership

709
00:41:42,912 --> 00:41:46,240
See him taking the time to sign up for 1 just to read something

710
00:41:46,496 --> 00:41:48,032
Since 2000

711
00:41:49,568 --> 00:41:54,431
I got up right now it's actually really interesting the way it is data and information

712
00:41:54,687 --> 00:41:55,199
Is laid out

713
00:41:55,455 --> 00:41:58,783
Is an outrageously informative presentation on topics

714
00:42:02,367 --> 00:42:04,927
It starts with the great reset in the middle

715
00:42:05,951 --> 00:42:09,279
A couple with nodes that are go off of that the branch out

716
00:42:09,791 --> 00:42:11,327
These nodes are things like

717
00:42:11,583 --> 00:42:13,119
Shaping the economic recovery

718
00:42:13,375 --> 00:42:15,935
Strengthening Regional development

719
00:42:17,727 --> 00:42:20,287
If you click on one of these let's use restoring health

720
00:42:20,543 --> 00:42:21,823
The environment as an example

721
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:27,199
It highlights all the issue on the outermost next set of nodes that relate to that topic

722
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:32,319
So in this case if you click on restoring the health of the environment you have things like the ocean

723
00:42:32,575 --> 00:42:33,087
Forest

724
00:42:35,135 --> 00:42:37,439
Plastics in the environment and a whole bunch of others

725
00:42:38,463 --> 00:42:40,255
Of course each of these nodes reflects

726
00:42:40,511 --> 00:42:42,815
The interplay with other nodes from the first level

727
00:42:43,071 --> 00:42:47,679
Like the ocean involves the intersection of restoring the health of the environment

728
00:42:47,935 --> 00:42:49,215
Evie Hardison before

729
00:42:49,471 --> 00:42:50,751
Industrial Revolution

730
00:42:51,519 --> 00:42:55,359
Then if you click on one of these issues with the outermost issues

731
00:42:57,407 --> 00:42:58,687
The farthest out nodes

732
00:43:00,735 --> 00:43:01,503
Because we've already been

733
00:43:01,759 --> 00:43:03,039
Using

734
00:43:03,551 --> 00:43:07,391
Example if you click on that you're taking to a whole new wheel of notes

735
00:43:07,903 --> 00:43:10,719
Now the ocean is in the center of the visualization witch

736
00:43:10,975 --> 00:43:12,511
With new node surrounding it

737
00:43:12,767 --> 00:43:13,791
Like overfishing

738
00:43:14,047 --> 00:43:16,095
Aquaculture

739
00:43:16,607 --> 00:43:17,119
And the ocean

740
00:43:17,887 --> 00:43:23,519
In the original visuals the great reset their outermost nodes

741
00:43:23,775 --> 00:43:25,055
In that visualization

742
00:43:25,567 --> 00:43:27,103
And each of these like the ocean

743
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:30,175
Transfer to their own wheel bearings

744
00:43:30,687 --> 00:43:35,807
What I'm saying is more than 100 pages of information on here

745
00:43:36,063 --> 00:43:38,623
But it's not laid out in any kind of way where you busy

746
00:43:38,879 --> 00:43:43,999
Plausible to be like I read most of it's almost like a visualization of the club of Rome

747
00:43:44,255 --> 00:43:50,399
Problematique in empty in that kind of sense

748
00:43:50,911 --> 00:43:51,935
Call to that

749
00:43:53,471 --> 00:43:55,263
Idea of a way to approach

750
00:43:55,519 --> 00:43:57,823
Problems is really interesting

751
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:01,919
I'm not positive there are a ton of

752
00:44:02,175 --> 00:44:03,199
Prescribed

753
00:44:08,063 --> 00:44:09,087
Within that

754
00:44:09,343 --> 00:44:15,487
But it's largely just about like these are topics that are really important

755
00:44:15,743 --> 00:44:18,303
Compiled by experts

756
00:44:18,559 --> 00:44:19,583
One of these

757
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:21,631
Is essentially a presentation

758
00:44:21,887 --> 00:44:24,191
That is is farmed out

759
00:44:24,447 --> 00:44:27,775
Two experts in the field

760
00:44:28,031 --> 00:44:31,359
I can't even pretend that I can accurately report on this visualization

761
00:44:31,615 --> 00:44:37,759
It's a presentation of presentation the presentation there's so much there and there's pertains to somebody different issues

762
00:44:38,015 --> 00:44:39,551
Poopy impossible for me to cover it

763
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:44,671
There's a lot of stuff to be found

764
00:44:44,927 --> 00:44:47,487
But it's really outside the scope of the show for me to break it all down

765
00:44:47,743 --> 00:44:51,071
The point is that Alex didn't do any work on this

766
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:54,399
About this op-ed

767
00:44:56,191 --> 00:45:01,567
On the world economic Forum 100-page report that he's read almost all of

768
00:45:01,823 --> 00:45:02,335
Blah blah blah

769
00:45:02,591 --> 00:45:06,687
This is all bulshit

770
00:45:06,943 --> 00:45:08,479
We're a lot of people's heads

771
00:45:08,735 --> 00:45:09,247
They're at cuz

772
00:45:09,503 --> 00:45:12,319
You can you can go to that and you can realize the scope of

773
00:45:12,575 --> 00:45:13,087
What's the problem

774
00:45:13,855 --> 00:45:18,463
Really visualize everything that's going on and how the entire system itself is set up

775
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:19,487
The Destroyer

776
00:45:21,023 --> 00:45:24,607
You could tell a strong crazy moron to kill your

777
00:45:24,863 --> 00:45:25,375
Friends

778
00:45:25,631 --> 00:45:26,143
And you're in

779
00:45:27,423 --> 00:45:29,727
Those are those are alternate strategy

780
00:45:29,983 --> 00:45:32,031
We just kind of think that one is easier than the other

781
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:38,431
Alex

782
00:45:38,943 --> 00:45:41,503
I suppose it's an expert about something

783
00:45:43,807 --> 00:45:44,831
Google Trends

784
00:45:49,695 --> 00:45:50,463
16

785
00:45:50,975 --> 00:45:52,255
The black lives matter

786
00:45:54,303 --> 00:45:54,815
Wash

787
00:45:55,839 --> 00:45:56,863
20%

788
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:09,151
Some stuff in for fun

789
00:46:09,919 --> 00:46:16,063
I already discussed the error that hotep Jesus is making our life episode how use a racing context from the trends numbers writing his own

790
00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:18,111
Story about it

791
00:46:18,367 --> 00:46:19,647
Again he was having his own son today

792
00:46:20,159 --> 00:46:20,671
Sure

793
00:46:21,183 --> 00:46:24,767
What's important to remember is that Alex's is the stuff about antifa

794
00:46:25,279 --> 00:46:29,631
If you go to Google Transit you type in Antigua is Enos picat all in 2016

795
00:46:29,887 --> 00:46:32,959
Cuz the right-wing wasn't obsessed with

796
00:46:33,215 --> 00:46:39,359
The first bike you see is on August 13th 2017 and that's because it was right after that

797
00:46:40,639 --> 00:46:42,431
What happened on August 12th

798
00:46:43,199 --> 00:46:49,343
You remember that was a bunch of

799
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:50,623
Protester in his car

800
00:46:53,439 --> 00:46:58,815
You may recall that there was a concerted campaign

801
00:46:59,071 --> 00:47:00,863
Which is undoubtedly why there was a spike

802
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:01,631
Or interest

803
00:47:01,887 --> 00:47:02,399
In August

804
00:47:02,655 --> 00:47:03,679
2017

805
00:47:04,191 --> 00:47:05,471
This is critical to understand

806
00:47:05,983 --> 00:47:10,847
Ultimately the Google prove anything other than there was an increased interest in a certain topic

807
00:47:11,103 --> 00:47:11,871
Make it a certain time

808
00:47:12,127 --> 00:47:16,735
Interestin blacklivesmatter increase after the murders of Alton Sterling and philando Castillo

809
00:47:16,991 --> 00:47:18,015
And the interest is

810
00:47:18,271 --> 00:47:20,575
Really spiky

811
00:47:21,087 --> 00:47:24,927
Increase

812
00:47:25,183 --> 00:47:25,695
Make sense

813
00:47:25,951 --> 00:47:30,303
People are curious about this thing that they hadn't heard of it people keep talking about so they Googled

814
00:47:31,071 --> 00:47:34,655
Alex is making up Google Transit formation 2016

815
00:47:34,911 --> 00:47:35,679
Which wouldn't mean anything

816
00:47:36,191 --> 00:47:36,959
Even if it were true

817
00:47:37,727 --> 00:47:38,495
Just for fun

818
00:47:38,751 --> 00:47:42,079
I just had to check the information for the

819
00:47:42,591 --> 00:47:44,383
Not surprisingly there was a spike

820
00:47:44,639 --> 00:47:46,687
On January 22nd 2017

821
00:47:46,943 --> 00:47:53,087
Because I was right after Trump got inaugurated president

822
00:47:53,343 --> 00:47:55,903
Who is in violation of that closet

823
00:47:56,159 --> 00:48:02,047
There's another big spike in late October 2019

824
00:48:02,303 --> 00:48:03,839
G7 at one of his properties

825
00:48:06,143 --> 00:48:06,655
Phony

826
00:48:07,167 --> 00:48:12,799
Neither of these spikes mean anything other than something people were talking about

827
00:48:13,055 --> 00:48:14,591
Contacts

828
00:48:14,847 --> 00:48:15,615
Around

829
00:48:15,871 --> 00:48:16,639
Each of these spikes

830
00:48:16,895 --> 00:48:19,967
You can clearly understand what the glue is reflecting

831
00:48:20,735 --> 00:48:21,503
Alex pretends

832
00:48:21,759 --> 00:48:24,063
Got a secret code that's being shown in these numbers

833
00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:25,087
Ridiculous but it's

834
00:48:25,343 --> 00:48:26,367
Prion praying for him

835
00:48:26,879 --> 00:48:27,903
Cuz he's a dumb dumb liar

836
00:48:29,183 --> 00:48:29,695
Dumb dumb

837
00:48:30,207 --> 00:48:35,071
I'm still going to go out

838
00:48:35,327 --> 00:48:37,631
The violence

839
00:48:38,399 --> 00:48:40,703
I can't see any other extra

840
00:48:41,215 --> 00:48:41,983
You have to shut up

841
00:48:42,239 --> 00:48:47,359
You're going to get us killed

842
00:48:48,895 --> 00:48:49,407
Holyshit

843
00:49:04,511 --> 00:49:10,655
Alex is a MPI.

844
00:49:11,679 --> 00:49:12,703
Is really all about killing

845
00:49:12,959 --> 00:49:13,471
Tops

846
00:49:13,983 --> 00:49:15,775
Find a particular irony

847
00:49:16,031 --> 00:49:17,311
In Alex's were

848
00:49:23,199 --> 00:49:23,711
Revolution

849
00:49:29,855 --> 00:49:31,903
So I don't think

850
00:49:32,159 --> 00:49:33,183
Speaking

851
00:49:33,439 --> 00:49:34,975
Kill cops even indoors

852
00:49:35,743 --> 00:49:38,815
Eliminating Police Department

853
00:49:39,071 --> 00:49:41,631
Stop short of expressing a desire to

854
00:49:41,887 --> 00:49:42,399
Kill all cops

855
00:49:43,167 --> 00:49:47,007
Alex come play with us

856
00:49:48,031 --> 00:49:49,055
Interesting

857
00:49:49,311 --> 00:49:55,455
In the past we've heard Alex very clearly expressed that if people start to pass gun regulations that he doesn't approve of the

858
00:49:55,711 --> 00:50:00,831
The right wing and start killing cops

859
00:50:01,087 --> 00:50:06,207
He's talked about it many times and extremist text unintended consequence

860
00:50:06,719 --> 00:50:10,815
Which was about right-wing extremist waging a war on the police because of gun laws

861
00:50:11,583 --> 00:50:12,351
We heard the topic

862
00:50:12,607 --> 00:50:18,495
Slightly get broached caller brought up unintended consequences Alex replied that it was a good book

863
00:50:23,615 --> 00:50:24,383
We just go get coffee

864
00:50:29,759 --> 00:50:33,087
So that was a show on January 16th 2013

865
00:50:33,343 --> 00:50:35,647
By February 10th 2013

866
00:50:35,903 --> 00:50:38,463
Covering the story of Chris daughter

867
00:50:38,719 --> 00:50:40,767
The LAPD cop who is going on a killing

868
00:50:41,023 --> 00:50:43,583
Seemingly primarily targeting police

869
00:50:44,095 --> 00:50:47,679
Alex was super upset that the shooting spree would lead to new gun regulation

870
00:50:47,935 --> 00:50:50,239
He expressed his concern

871
00:50:50,495 --> 00:50:52,287
Brett police games

872
00:50:52,799 --> 00:50:53,311
Gun owners

873
00:50:53,567 --> 00:50:55,103
Would rise up and kill them

874
00:51:02,271 --> 00:51:04,831
Motorcycles

875
00:51:09,951 --> 00:51:11,999
20 something

876
00:51:13,791 --> 00:51:17,887
Social engineering

877
00:51:32,991 --> 00:51:33,759
And just go out

878
00:51:44,767 --> 00:51:50,911
Play way more explicit about this whole thing directly

879
00:51:52,959 --> 00:51:54,751
Literally all cops would be dead

880
00:51:55,007 --> 00:51:55,775
Very quickly

881
00:52:31,359 --> 00:52:33,663
You can see here on Alex's mindworks

882
00:52:33,919 --> 00:52:37,247
Version of the current protests

883
00:52:37,503 --> 00:52:38,271
Make them scared

884
00:52:38,527 --> 00:52:41,599
In this reality these protesters

885
00:52:41,855 --> 00:52:43,135
Because I just going to end up

886
00:52:43,391 --> 00:52:43,903
Bordelaise

887
00:52:44,671 --> 00:52:45,951
In case of husted issue

888
00:52:46,207 --> 00:52:47,999
Imaginary

889
00:52:48,255 --> 00:52:54,399
He's directly threatening the lives of literally all cops in the country with murder

890
00:52:54,655 --> 00:52:58,239
Real and this is smart and will not end up with more police

891
00:52:58,751 --> 00:53:04,895
This is a dreadful Glimpse because what it tells you that Alex wishes

892
00:53:05,151 --> 00:53:06,687
Protesting for a cause he's opposed to

893
00:53:06,943 --> 00:53:08,735
In this case greater equality in terms

894
00:53:08,991 --> 00:53:09,503
Justice

895
00:53:10,015 --> 00:53:13,855
However when it comes to issues impacted by like gun regulation

896
00:53:14,111 --> 00:53:18,207
He feels entitled to any violence against the state to the point of murdering all cops

897
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:25,631
This is an astoundingly authoritarian level

898
00:53:25,887 --> 00:53:28,959
Provide some explanation for how we got to where we are now

899
00:53:29,215 --> 00:53:30,239
Alex has always been this

900
00:53:33,823 --> 00:53:37,407
Massive ships that have happened since Trump

901
00:53:37,663 --> 00:53:38,687
He's always been

902
00:53:38,943 --> 00:53:41,759
Fundamentally I want everybody who disagrees with me

903
00:53:42,271 --> 00:53:42,783
Yeah

904
00:53:44,831 --> 00:53:49,951
You know it's the term the guy use so much like right after Trump's election that kind of became

905
00:53:50,207 --> 00:53:52,255
I kind of a joke was emboldened

906
00:53:52,511 --> 00:53:53,279
But legitimate

907
00:53:53,791 --> 00:53:54,559
I think

908
00:53:54,815 --> 00:53:56,607
Clearly what you see with Alex's

909
00:53:56,863 --> 00:53:57,375
Not so much

910
00:53:58,399 --> 00:53:59,167
Total Gym

911
00:53:59,679 --> 00:54:01,983
Impulses

912
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:03,775
And things that were there already

913
00:54:04,031 --> 00:54:05,311
Yeah absolutely

914
00:54:05,567 --> 00:54:06,335
And then it just

915
00:54:06,847 --> 00:54:08,639
Underscores the fact that the

916
00:54:08,895 --> 00:54:11,455
Heart rate for all their Bluster about wanting a second

917

They don't want a revolution

921
00:54:20,415 --> 00:54:26,559
They don't want to change the system is great for them

922
00:54:29,887 --> 00:54:35,263
Alex is his big thing that he goes I guess someone forwarded him like

923
00:54:35,519 --> 00:54:36,287
A Facebook post

924
00:54:36,543 --> 00:54:37,055
Or something

925
00:54:37,311 --> 00:54:40,895
Protest organizers who were explaining like

926
00:54:41,151 --> 00:54:42,175

936
00:55:09,055 --> 00:55:09,823
Other protesters

Track people down and suck at throwing up

941
00:55:20,063 --> 00:55:22,623
Concerns that this post that Alex is making

00:55:37,471 --> 00:55:38,751
When we come back

946
00:55:39,519 --> 00:55:40,287
And I'll stop the bubble

947
00:55:44,383 --> 00:55:45,151
No selfies

00:55:45,663 --> 00:55:46,687
Bosch

949
00:55:47,199 --> 00:55:47,967
Reinventing slavery

950

00:55:54,111 --> 00:55:55,647
The biggest sale

953
00:55:55,903 --> 00:55:56,415
This year

954
00:55:57,183 --> 00:55:58,207
Gold sale

955
00:55:59,487 --> 00:56:00,511
This is just tiresome

956
00:56:00,767 --> 00:56:02,303
This this level of like

957
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:05,887
Misrepresenting stuff

958
00:56:06,399 --> 00:56:08,703
Stupid

00:56:08,959 --> 00:56:09,471
Gestalt

960
00:56:09,983 --> 00:56:11,519
Something

00:56:11,775 --> 00:56:12,543
Told you

962
00:56:12,799 --> 00:56:13,567
About

963
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:16,383
Because I was just bored

964
00:56:16,639 --> 00:56:17,919
And I don't care

965
00:56:18,943 --> 00:56:20,991
A couple days Alex has been having a

966
00:56:21,247 --> 00:56:24,319
Chess board skull and roses on his desk

967
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:31,743
Pretending

968
00:56:31,999 --> 00:56:37,375
Set dresser to look at it

969
00:56:37,631 --> 00:56:43,775
Despite his desk before he's brought up that like is Dad is a dentist near the skull

970
00:56:44,031 --> 00:56:46,847
He found it

971
00:56:47,103 --> 00:56:47,615
He wasn't

972
00:56:48,639 --> 00:56:54,783
Cuz it's taking to the next level with a chessboard

973
00:56:55,039 --> 00:56:58,111
Roses

974
00:57:01,439 --> 00:57:01,951

975
00:57:02,463 --> 00:57:04,511
I can't tell you enough how much I love this clip

976
00:57:06,303 --> 00:57:07,071
Is

977
00:57:08,351 --> 00:57:13,983
This is what kind of overdose

978
00:57:14,495 --> 00:57:20,639
For me the other stuff I can handle the hardships

979
00:57:23,455 --> 00:57:23,967
With you

980
00:57:26,527 --> 00:57:27,039

982
00:57:35,487 --> 00:57:37,279
Can just look directly into the camera

983
00:57:38,559 --> 00:57:40,607
Radio Western

984
00:57:43,679 --> 00:57:47,007
Who is Mike Trout

985
00:57:49,055 --> 00:57:49,567
Askew

986
00:57:49,823 --> 00:57:50,335
Do you want

987
00:57:50,847 --> 00:57:51,871
You control your own future

988
00:57:55,199 --> 00:57:56,223
Future

989
00:57:56,991 --> 00:57:58,015
Do you want a pro-human

990
00:58:04,159 --> 00:58:04,671
Decided

991
00:58:05,695 --> 00:58:06,207
You're worthless

992
00:58:14,143 --> 00:58:14,911
But you need

993
00:58:23,615 --> 00:58:24,127
Just rhetoric

994
00:58:28,479 --> 00:58:29,247
But I'm up here

995
00:58:36,671 --> 00:58:37,183
Things that are half

996
00:58:39,487 --> 00:58:40,255
Your family's future

997
00:58:54,591 --> 00:58:56,127
I should appear on this TV program

998
00:58:57,407 --> 00:58:58,175
This chat said

999
00:58:58,431 --> 00:58:59,199
The skull

1000
00:58:59,711 --> 00:59:00,223
The flowers

1001
00:59:01,503 --> 00:59:02,271
Why do people fast

1002
00:59:06,111 --> 00:59:06,623
Your show it looks

1003
00:59:17,119 --> 00:59:17,631
Superjet

1004
00:59:17,887 --> 00:59:18,399
On the edge

1005
00:59:19,423 --> 00:59:19,935
What you're thinking

1006
00:59:22,751 --> 00:59:23,263
Tumi

1007
00:59:25,823 --> 00:59:27,103
All God's gifts

1008
00:59:30,687 --> 00:59:32,223
StreetWise

1009
00:59:45,023 --> 00:59:47,071
A while

1010
00:59:50,911 --> 00:59:57,055
Oh my God that's so perfect to me that is like

1011
00:59:57,311 --> 00:59:57,823
Funniest

1012
00:59:58,079 --> 00:59:59,359
F****** thing in the world

1013
00:59:59,871 --> 01:00:00,895
It's

1014
01:00:01,151 --> 01:00:02,687
Alex

1015
01:00:02,943 --> 01:00:03,455
2 minutes

1016
01:00:03,711 --> 01:00:04,991
Of like oh my God

1017
01:00:05,247 --> 01:00:07,295
No one could do that but Alex

1018
01:00:08,063 --> 01:00:10,367
So it started esoteric

1019
01:00:10,623 --> 01:00:12,671
I want to walk you through what's so great about this

1020
01:00:12,927 --> 01:00:18,303
It starts with Alex he has responsibility to prove anything

1021
01:00:18,559 --> 01:00:21,119
Sure I can prove it all but instead I'm just going to

1022
01:00:21,375 --> 01:00:27,007
Speaker earnestly into the camera am rattle off a bunch of vague platitudes about nothing lot easier to do that in such a

1023
01:00:27,263 --> 01:00:28,287
Perfect encapsulation

1024
01:00:28,543 --> 01:00:30,079
Alex's style of proven things

1025
01:00:30,591 --> 01:00:34,175
It runs through so much of his program how do you say you know like

1026
01:00:34,431 --> 01:00:37,503
But I can't get to any of it so he doesn't get that

1027
01:00:37,759 --> 01:00:42,111
Right there's so many major news stories break

1028
01:00:42,623 --> 01:00:44,415
This is Alex's sleight-of-hand

1029
01:00:44,671 --> 01:00:45,951
Dixon just to Clearview

1030
01:00:46,207 --> 01:00:46,719
Amazing

1031
01:00:47,231 --> 01:00:49,791
Alex gets to the chess set in the scope of the Rose

1032
01:00:50,303 --> 01:00:53,119
Riverbend except he's on his desk for the last few days

1033
01:00:53,375 --> 01:00:55,167
You like about it

1034
01:00:55,423 --> 01:00:57,727
Obviously there's some kind of point he's trying to impart

1035
01:01:02,079 --> 01:01:03,615
It means whatever it means to you

1036
01:01:04,127 --> 01:01:09,759
Alex instinctually knows that this is disappointing as hell so he starts breaking down what it means to him

1037
01:01:10,015 --> 01:01:13,599
Apparently the rose is a tree that symbolizes

1038
01:01:13,855 --> 01:01:15,647
Add red blood to the red rose

1039
01:01:15,903 --> 01:01:19,743
I bet it all falls apart

1040
01:01:20,255 --> 01:01:24,351
A very clearly sounded like he got distracted by his own bullets and then was like

1041
01:01:24,607 --> 01:01:25,887
Wait what was the fuc

1042
01:01:26,143 --> 01:01:32,287
Just about any of this toroso you thought because you're special report

1043
01:01:33,055 --> 01:01:39,199
You want so desperately to be reflected in these

1044
01:01:40,479 --> 01:01:45,087
It's hilarious what an active putting on here just everything is pretense and facade

1045
01:01:45,343 --> 01:01:47,903
He acts like he can prove his claims

1046
01:01:48,159 --> 01:01:51,487
Batteries

1047
01:01:51,999 --> 01:01:56,607
He act like he was some kind of a deep esoteric message props on his desk

1048
01:01:56,863 --> 01:01:59,679
You can't come up with a ship pass calling

1049
01:01:59,935 --> 01:02:03,263
He acts like he's fully committed to his show and all the same

1050
01:02:03,519 --> 01:02:06,079
I want things are going well

1051
01:02:06,335 --> 01:02:10,943
This dude is legitimately the saddest person in media right now.

1052
01:02:11,199 --> 01:02:12,223
Just

1053
01:02:12,479 --> 01:02:16,319
He was like he's like if a bookshelf filled with cardboard box

1054
01:02:16,575 --> 01:02:19,135
This is bound to look like Britannica became a person

1055
01:02:22,463 --> 01:02:25,279
It's almost impressively that

1056
01:02:25,535 --> 01:02:31,679
No one else could do big books

1057
01:02:32,959 --> 01:02:34,239
Just like okay stale

1058
01:02:34,495 --> 01:02:38,079
And then come back and stay on tomorrow never learn any lesson

1059
01:02:40,639 --> 01:02:41,663
You telling me that there are less

1060
01:02:42,687 --> 01:02:43,199
Amazing

1061
01:02:43,967 --> 01:02:50,111
Really rich people in fair enough discussion of Jeff Bezos

1062
01:02:50,367 --> 01:02:53,439
This little piece of his

1063
01:02:53,695 --> 01:02:54,719
Really reflects

1064
01:02:54,975 --> 01:02:58,047
Ultimately how bad Alex is even with a Leo

1065
01:03:05,215 --> 01:03:07,263
0 1%

1066
01:03:12,127 --> 01:03:12,639
$37

1067
01:03:13,151 --> 01:03:15,199
Fairies all good and well

1068
01:03:21,087 --> 01:03:24,671
Dissolution probably to get Bezos to give a billion to Gunn weirdos

1069
01:03:24,927 --> 01:03:25,951
I'm not I don't care

1070
01:03:26,463 --> 01:03:28,255
So what I'm most interested nightclub is the mass

1071
01:03:29,279 --> 01:03:32,863
You take the ratio

1072
01:03:33,119 --> 01:03:35,679
Maybe the equivalent of them giving $87 a year

1073
01:03:36,447 --> 01:03:41,567
Alex's claim at 8.01% of Bezos income

1074
01:03:41,823 --> 01:03:43,615
The same as $87 to euro

1075
01:03:44,127 --> 01:03:45,151
Some news for Alec

1076
01:03:45,919 --> 01:03:52,063
$87 to be .01% of your income in $870,000

1077
01:03:56,415 --> 01:04:01,023
Come on Investopedia the median income in the United States per household

1078
01:04:01,279 --> 01:04:04,351
In 2018 with 63000 179 dollars

1079
01:04:04,863 --> 01:04:09,215
I've no idea what Alex thinks about at all

1080
01:04:09,983 --> 01:04:15,871
I heard him throughout those numbers and even without doing the math I do this is load of s*** but I didn't realize how far off he was

1081
01:04:16,639 --> 01:04:20,479
What's going on here is it out with Miss read the headline in Vox that he's trying to cover

1082
01:04:20,991 --> 01:04:22,015
Which of the Bezos gay

1083
01:04:22,271 --> 01:04:23,807
1% of his wealth

1084
01:04:24,063 --> 01:04:25,343
Charity in 2018

1085
01:04:25,855 --> 01:04:29,439
But in the headline this is visualized as 0.1

1086
01:04:29,695 --> 01:04:32,511
Sounds just moved until 1

1087
01:04:32,767 --> 01:04:38,655
Alright you didn't realize how big of a difference moving the decimal point

1088
01:04:38,911 --> 01:04:42,239
Accuracies they come from sloppy and lazy reporting

1089
01:04:42,751 --> 01:04:45,823
You could say that it doesn't matter that the point of Bezos doesn't give enough

1090
01:04:46,079 --> 01:04:47,103
The charity is right

1091
01:04:50,175 --> 01:04:52,735
This is a serious issue like bezos's charity

1092
01:04:58,879 --> 01:05:04,255
Actually has misread to score dumb points.

1093
01:05:05,023 --> 01:05:07,839
Incapable the kind of discussions

1094
01:05:08,095 --> 01:05:08,863
Solve problems

1095
01:05:09,119 --> 01:05:11,935
Society the billionaires are hypothetical trillionaires

1096
01:05:12,191 --> 01:05:14,751
He's part of it is just

1097
01:05:15,263 --> 01:05:19,359
Kind of counterproductive

1098
01:05:19,615 --> 01:05:20,383
Six of the topic

1099
01:05:20,639 --> 01:05:22,687
Cuz he doesn't eat skimmed a headlines

1100
01:05:22,943 --> 01:05:24,991

Send

1102
01:05:26,015 --> 01:05:27,551
It is a small problem

1103
01:05:27,807 --> 01:05:33,951
Implies a large problem if you were to go to a protest at Jeff Bezos

1104
01:05:34,463 --> 01:05:35,999
How's about this situation

1105
01:05:36,511 --> 01:05:39,327
He would not sit and listen to the f****** organizers

1106
01:05:39,583 --> 01:05:45,727
Play some b*******

1107
01:05:51,871 --> 01:05:53,407
Protests in Austin

1108
01:05:53,919 --> 01:05:58,783
All that Alex came out the organizers

1109
01:05:59,039 --> 01:06:05,183
We're trying to get him to come speak up on the diocese just distracting

1110
01:06:06,463 --> 01:06:08,767
Point where they theorize that like he was

1111
01:06:09,023 --> 01:06:10,815
Intentionally disrupting their protest

1112
01:06:11,327 --> 01:06:15,935
And it probably wasn't that

1113
01:06:16,191 --> 01:06:22,335
It is that kind of takes them over

1114
01:06:22,591 --> 01:06:26,687
And he doesn't take them over just makes them s*** makes everybody hate

1115
01:06:26,943 --> 01:06:27,455
Yeah

1116
01:06:29,759 --> 01:06:31,295
This is another one that's really fascinating

1117
01:06:32,831 --> 01:06:36,415
Hilarious

1118
01:06:36,671 --> 01:06:42,815
Fantastic in the same way there's something that is

1119
01:06:43,071 --> 01:06:43,583
Anything you stalking

1120
01:06:44,351 --> 01:06:46,143
And I'll discuss it

1121
01:06:46,399 --> 01:06:46,911
After you left

1122
01:06:48,447 --> 01:06:48,959
The biggest

1123
01:06:51,775 --> 01:06:52,287
Myself

1124
01:06:52,543 --> 01:06:53,055
For you for your

1125
01:07:04,063 --> 01:07:05,087
Businesses

1126
01:07:09,695 --> 01:07:10,463
You guys got a mic

1127
01:07:21,727 --> 01:07:23,007
Really stressed out about all this

1128
01:07:27,103 --> 01:07:29,151
Show now

1129
01:07:31,967 --> 01:07:33,247
Adjustable mattress

1130
01:07:41,439 --> 01:07:43,487
Medical martial law

1131

Operate

1132
01:07:47,839 --> 01:07:49,119
Did he ran Jeffrey

1133
01:07:49,375 --> 01:07:50,143
Operation

1134
01:07:57,823 --> 01:07:58,335

1136

Scientific

1137
01:08:06,783 --> 01:08:08,319
Clipper super interesting

1138
01:08:08,575 --> 01:08:13,439
You can tell from Alex's tone and he was preparing

1139
01:08:13,695 --> 01:08:18,815
Or more likely begging his audience to spread it around and sucker in new customer

1140
01:08:19,583 --> 01:08:23,423
It's very distinctive ramps

1141
01:08:23,679 --> 01:08:24,703
Before the end of the hour

1142
01:08:24,959 --> 01:08:27,007
That's usually when he's most likely to plug

1143
01:08:27,263 --> 01:08:29,567
Trying to tell by the tone of his voice at the beginning of the

1144
01:08:30,335 --> 01:08:36,479
Then he gets distracted by Tech problems and completely loses his train of thought and he blows up about how he's not doing any of this

1145
01:08:36,735 --> 01:08:37,247
The theatrics

1146
01:08:38,015 --> 01:08:41,855
When he realizes that he's got a big daddy charcoal about accusations it is being theatrical

1147
01:08:42,111 --> 01:08:45,183
He knows he has to give some kind of an explanation for why he's on edge

1148
01:08:45,439 --> 01:08:46,463
Can you see what he comes up with

1149
01:08:46,975 --> 01:08:50,303
It's the Bill Gates was Jeffrey Epstein's entire operation

1150
01:08:52,095 --> 01:08:53,887
Here's what's fascinating

1151
01:08:54,655 --> 01:08:57,727
You can actually hear Alex decide to run with a narrative

1152
01:08:58,495 --> 01:09:03,871
I'll play you just a little section where you can hear his footing Shake slightly and then you can hear him reassure himself

1153
01:09:04,383 --> 01:09:04,895
Fascinating

1154
01:09:06,175 --> 01:09:07,967
Medical martial law

1155
01:09:09,759 --> 01:09:10,783
Jeffrey Epstein

1156
01:09:14,879 --> 01:09:21,023
You can hear it in the tone he says the Bill Gates ran Epstein's operation and then

1157
01:09:24,351 --> 01:09:30,495
It's amazing to me since it's not very often you can hear Alex Devore extreme narratives in real time

1158
01:09:31,263 --> 01:09:36,895
Clear the gates and Epstein knew each other and there was a connection between the two in the past and that's all good and well

1159
01:09:37,151 --> 01:09:38,431
But this is a massive departure

1160
01:09:38,687 --> 01:09:39,711
From that beaten path

1161
01:09:40,223 --> 01:09:44,831
This is honestly possibly the kind of slander you might even get in trouble with the

1162
01:09:45,087 --> 01:09:47,903
Black figure

1163
01:09:48,159 --> 01:09:54,303
Alex directly asserting on his operation wasn't

1164
01:09:54,559 --> 01:09:55,327
Going to making snuff film

1165
01:09:56,095 --> 01:09:59,679
Obviously it's not worth cases time to get into the mud with Alex but that

1166
01:09:59,935 --> 01:10:01,983
Hesitation and reassurance

1167
01:10:02,239 --> 01:10:04,543
I'm almost certain about I was I was thinking

1168
01:10:04,799 --> 01:10:05,567
I get away with this

1169
01:10:05,823 --> 01:10:06,847
I meant deciding that he care

1170
01:10:07,615 --> 01:10:10,431
I'm not sure this is the best place for someone to step in it

1171
01:10:10,687 --> 01:10:11,711
Eat Alex's lunch

1172
01:10:11,967 --> 01:10:15,551
No one has financially destroyed

1173
01:10:15,807 --> 01:10:19,903
Because they eat makes jet up to this point

1174
01:10:22,207 --> 01:10:24,511
Just know that there's no consequences raining he said

1175
01:10:25,023 --> 01:10:30,399
Any evidence being involved in murders and there's no consequences

1176
01:10:31,167 --> 01:10:32,703
It's honestly pretty remarkable

1177
01:10:32,959 --> 01:10:38,079
Is basically a living example of how these sorts of laws only apply when someone is willing to enforce them

1178
01:10:38,335 --> 01:10:44,479
And if you spend all your time slandering

1179
01:10:44,735 --> 01:10:47,039
You're pretty much free to say whatever you want about them

1180
01:10:47,807 --> 01:10:49,855
So let this be a lesson to Future propagandist

1181
01:10:50,367 --> 01:10:51,903
If you want to make materially false

1182
01:10:52,159 --> 01:10:53,439
Defamatory claims about someone

1183
01:10:53,695 --> 01:10:56,255
Always go for top-tier targets

1184
01:10:56,511 --> 01:11:01,631
Trouble is when you go after private persons like Sandy Hook families

1185
01:11:01,887 --> 01:11:03,935
Or mid-tier folks like the owner of Chobani

1186
01:11:04,447 --> 01:11:05,983
Actually are too busy

1187
01:11:06,239 --> 01:11:09,823
So you can just defend them all you want it generally there'll be no,

1188
01:11:10,079 --> 01:11:13,151
Isn't there

1189
01:11:13,407 --> 01:11:15,711
You know okay I get babies busy

1190
01:11:15,967 --> 01:11:16,735
Maybe he's busy

1191
01:11:16,991 --> 01:11:17,759
What do I give him

1192
01:11:18,527 --> 01:11:20,319
But come on just send that guy

1193
01:11:20,575 --> 01:11:22,879
100 Junior lawyers

1194
01:11:23,135 --> 01:11:24,671
For somebody straight out of Law School

1195
01:11:24,927 --> 01:11:28,767
Slam-dunk case give them their first win right out the gate

1196
01:11:29,023 --> 01:11:30,303
50 Grand a year you'll get it

1197
01:11:30,559 --> 01:11:31,583
Possibly

1198
01:11:31,839 --> 01:11:33,119
You know you end up

1199
01:11:33,887 --> 01:11:40,031
As we've seen with so many of these cases that Alex is involved in a situation

1200
01:11:40,287 --> 01:11:42,335
Motortrend create more attention for himself

1201
01:11:42,591 --> 01:11:46,431
You end up with the possibility of like just getting bogged down in something

1202
01:11:46,687 --> 01:11:52,831
The plays at his hand even if you would end up winning the case

1203
01:11:53,087 --> 01:11:59,231
Don't even talk to don't even acknowledge that there is a lawsuit

1204
01:12:00,511 --> 01:12:05,119
My position on it is more that like that

1205
01:12:05,375 --> 01:12:06,655
This point

1206
01:12:06,911 --> 01:12:09,471
Probably past the point where anyone

1207
01:12:09,727 --> 01:12:11,263
Outside in

1208
01:12:11,775 --> 01:12:13,055
Indicating that way

1209
01:12:14,847 --> 01:12:15,871
Long ago

1210
01:12:16,383 --> 01:12:18,431
Yeah so what

1211
01:12:18,687 --> 01:12:24,831
New project Veritas video

1212
01:12:26,623 --> 01:12:27,647
Any plays little bit of it

1213
01:12:28,159 --> 01:12:28,671
Alex is dumb

1214
01:12:40,703 --> 01:12:43,775
Videos complete

1215
01:12:44,543 --> 01:12:45,823
In the video James O'Keefe

1216
01:12:46,079 --> 01:12:50,943
Ellen and proven repeatedly liar

1217
01:12:51,455 --> 01:12:54,015
Of course this person is completely Anonymous and has their face

1218
01:12:54,271 --> 01:12:57,599
Skewers are honestly everything up they probably are

1219
01:12:58,111 --> 01:12:59,647
There's some serious inconsistency

1220
01:12:59,903 --> 01:13:03,487
She's a come up in the video which The Daily Beast

1221
01:13:04,255 --> 01:13:10,399
The biggest one is the guy in the video

1222
01:13:10,655 --> 01:13:11,679
Storage Portland

1223
01:13:11,935 --> 01:13:18,079
Call Kim Edwards open for business problem

1224
01:13:18,335 --> 01:13:22,943
Because according to Oregon live in other words closed in 2018

1225
01:13:23,199 --> 01:13:27,807
What does indicator shows this bookstore for a reason easy to guess what that reason is

1226
01:13:28,319 --> 01:13:33,695
In other words was the inspiration for the fictional book store women and women first in the show Portlandia

1227
01:13:34,207 --> 01:13:40,351
If you are a right-wing propaganda attacking you were trying to come up with a location for this militant sjw

1228
01:13:40,607 --> 01:13:45,727
It makes sense with the first thing come to mind Be the One Bookstore you've heard of in that City

1229
01:13:45,983 --> 01:13:47,519
But you have to do your homework

1230
01:13:47,775 --> 01:13:52,127
Because when you don't wind up questions

1231
01:13:53,151 --> 01:13:54,431
There's undercover footage

1232
01:13:54,687 --> 01:13:58,783
In a video that's alleged to be from one of these secret antifa meetings in other words

1233
01:13:59,295 --> 01:14:01,087
But that's not really possible

1234
01:14:01,343 --> 01:14:02,879
Business for over

1235
01:14:03,135 --> 01:14:03,647
For two years

1236
01:14:04,159 --> 01:14:07,999
Possibility

1237
01:14:08,767 --> 01:14:10,303
It's not like it's supposed to

1238
01:14:10,815 --> 01:14:12,351
2017 Pacifica

1239
01:14:13,631 --> 01:14:15,679
It'll be completely laughable and discredited

1240
01:14:15,935 --> 01:14:16,703
Under normal

1241
01:14:17,983 --> 01:14:21,823
He was doing as a strong potential to lead to violence against left-leaning protesters

1242
01:14:22,079 --> 01:14:24,895
Easily tricked viewers will assume

1243
01:14:25,151 --> 01:14:25,663
Domestic Terror

1244
01:14:26,431 --> 01:14:29,759
This is one of the reasons why people have to be shut down

1245
01:14:30,015 --> 01:14:36,159
If you was doing some cigarettes gate of Journalism like into the potential political malfeasance of democratic

1246
01:14:36,671 --> 01:14:39,231
Are reporting on stories that were real inconvenience

1247
01:14:39,487 --> 01:14:40,511
To the left

1248
01:14:40,767 --> 01:14:43,071
Absolutely defend entirely is right

1249
01:14:43,327 --> 01:14:44,351
Continue doing that work

1250
01:14:44,863 --> 01:14:46,143
His career is just too full of

1251
01:14:46,399 --> 01:14:46,911
Complete fraud

1252
01:14:48,959 --> 01:14:52,031
Ultimately he doesn't care if what he puts outputs

1253
01:14:52,287 --> 01:14:52,799
People in danger

1254
01:14:53,311 --> 01:14:56,127
His misinformation isn't intellectual or abstract

1255
01:14:56,383 --> 01:15:00,223
He's lying in a ways that can directly lead to people getting hurt and that

1256
01:15:00,479 --> 01:15:02,271
Cannot be allowed to continue

1257
01:15:02,527 --> 01:15:05,855
Mikey

1258
01:15:06,111 --> 01:15:08,415
Inspire

1259
01:15:08,671 --> 01:15:09,439
Inspired by

1260
01:15:10,719 --> 01:15:14,047
Or something I don't know what the mechanism would be but like this

1261
01:15:14,303 --> 01:15:14,815
Is

1262
01:15:15,071 --> 01:15:19,167
This is unacceptable

1263
01:15:19,679 --> 01:15:21,215
One of our laws should have just been like

1264
01:15:21,727 --> 01:15:23,775
If you're doing grbl s***

1265
01:15:24,031 --> 01:15:24,543
No

1266
01:15:25,311 --> 01:15:29,663
Like real simple just like a grbl did this this in this that's bad

1267
01:15:29,919 --> 01:15:31,455
Don't do that if you do

1268
01:15:33,247 --> 01:15:34,527
I don't understand

1269
01:15:34,783 --> 01:15:36,831
Yeah

1270
01:15:37,343 --> 01:15:38,623
Clear and transparent b*******

1271
01:15:39,903 --> 01:15:40,671
Troubling

1272
01:15:40,927 --> 01:15:44,255
Not good because there's other s*** going on

1273
01:15:44,511 --> 01:15:47,839
Cialix

1274
01:15:48,095 --> 01:15:49,119
George Floyd's death

1275
01:15:49,375 --> 01:15:52,447
And trying to use it for his own political purposes

1276
01:15:52,703 --> 01:15:54,751
Really interesting the way he's taking

1277
01:15:55,007 --> 01:15:58,591
And using it to reinforce a narrative that he already had

1278
01:15:59,103 --> 01:15:59,615
Is not

1279
01:16:13,695 --> 01:16:14,975
Covid-19

1280
01:16:18,559 --> 01:16:19,327
We obviously.

1281
01:16:22,655 --> 01:16:28,799
So it is true that George Floyd tested positive for Coronavirus back in April

1282
01:16:29,055 --> 01:16:31,871
Autopsy

1283
01:16:32,127 --> 01:16:33,407
Do the covid-19 death count

1284
01:16:34,175 --> 01:16:39,807
Airports I can find coronavirus played any role in his death

1285
01:16:40,063 --> 01:16:44,927
Just assuming because he tested positive he was listed then as a covid death

1286
01:16:45,695 --> 01:16:51,327
Differently by different states

1287
01:16:51,583 --> 01:16:52,863
Spectre too sloppy

1288
01:16:53,119 --> 01:16:53,887
Muscle

1289
01:16:55,679 --> 01:17:01,823
Would have looked into this at all they would have found that the state of Minnesota released specific

1290
01:17:02,079 --> 01:17:03,871
Reporting covid-19

1291
01:17:04,127 --> 01:17:04,639
Back in April

1292
01:17:05,663 --> 01:17:06,943
If they looked into this

1293
01:17:07,199 --> 01:17:09,759
He might have a better understanding

1294
01:17:10,527 --> 01:17:12,575
Reporting form in Minnesota has multiple

1295
01:17:13,087 --> 01:17:16,927
The first most important section is about the underlying cause of death

1296
01:17:17,439 --> 01:17:20,767
This is part one and it set up as a sequence of causality

1297
01:17:21,279 --> 01:17:25,375
In one example they give the cause of death could be reported as a cute dress

1298
01:17:25,631 --> 01:17:26,655
For Tory distress symptom

1299
01:17:26,911 --> 01:17:29,471
Due to pneumonia covid-19

1300
01:17:30,239 --> 01:17:31,519
There's a descendant causality

1301
01:17:31,775 --> 01:17:36,127
Cause of death is like

1302
01:17:36,895 --> 01:17:42,527
The second section part to where the death certifier other significant conditions

1303
01:17:42,783 --> 01:17:43,551
Contributing to death

1304
01:17:43,807 --> 01:17:46,879
Not resulting in the underlying cause given in part 1

1305
01:17:47,903 --> 01:17:53,279
Possible

1306
01:17:53,535 --> 01:17:54,815
Does

1307
01:17:57,119 --> 01:18:01,471
There's another consideration to keep in mind and then Minnesota guidance.

1308
01:18:03,007 --> 01:18:08,383
The manner of death sometimes referred to as circumstances of death is also reported on death

1309
01:18:09,151 --> 01:18:14,015
In the case of death due to covid-19 infection the manner of death will almost always be natural

1310
01:18:15,039 --> 01:18:20,415
What are the other classifications of manner of death was homicide

1311
01:18:20,927 --> 01:18:23,487
Classification of homicide almost by definition

1312
01:18:23,743 --> 01:18:25,791
That's for being counted as a covid-19

1313
01:18:26,559 --> 01:18:29,631
In order for covid-19

1314
01:18:29,887 --> 01:18:32,703
Case where someone was intentionally insect

1315
01:18:32,959 --> 01:18:34,495
People shot this

1316
01:18:40,895 --> 01:18:42,943
That is a claim that Alex's asserting is fat

1317
01:18:43,455 --> 01:18:47,295
He needs to back that up and he absolutely can't do it which means he's making this s*** up

1318
01:18:49,087 --> 01:18:50,623
Yeah no I need anyting

1319
01:18:52,159 --> 01:18:53,183
I'm done with

1320
01:18:53,439 --> 01:18:54,207
Distractions about

1321
01:18:55,487 --> 01:18:56,767
Now it doesn't I don't care

1322
01:18:57,023 --> 01:18:59,839
I don't care what

1323
01:19:00,095 --> 01:19:02,143
We can't get distracted

1324
01:19:05,983 --> 01:19:11,359
So is mostly about discussing these distractions

1325
01:19:11,615 --> 01:19:17,759
Is the paradise unfortunately frustrating because of the nature of the thing we decided to do

1326
01:19:18,271 --> 01:19:20,063
No

1327
01:19:21,855 --> 01:19:26,975
I don't think the podcast where I just scream

1328
01:19:27,231 --> 01:19:31,327
Times when I've had to just say so

1329
01:19:31,583 --> 01:19:34,399
You're entitled to that

1330
01:19:34,655 --> 01:19:39,007
Voice in a point to make is that a lot of this stuff is distractionary

1331
01:19:39,263 --> 01:19:40,287
It's meant

1332
01:19:40,543 --> 01:19:42,591
Take focus and attention away from

1333
01:19:42,847 --> 01:19:43,615
These protests

1334
01:19:43,871 --> 01:19:46,687
That are growing

1335
01:19:47,455 --> 01:19:49,759
It's the same thing with attack

1336
01:19:50,015 --> 01:19:52,319
The tactic of Summer

1337
01:19:52,575 --> 01:19:55,135
Focusing on

1338
01:19:55,391 --> 01:19:57,183
Tens of thousands of people gathered

1339
01:19:57,439 --> 01:19:59,743
2chan to a speaker

1340
01:19:59,999 --> 01:20:01,279
Or make a point

1341
01:20:03,583 --> 01:20:06,399
The distraction everything and is always important

1342
01:20:07,167 --> 01:20:08,191
Do remember

1343
01:20:08,447 --> 01:20:09,727
What the Center focus

1344
01:20:09,983 --> 01:20:12,543
Your eyes to be taken off

1345
01:20:13,311 --> 01:20:16,128
Because otherwise you lose

1346
01:20:20,224 --> 01:20:20,736
Entire job is

1347
01:20:20,992 --> 01:20:21,504
To take eyes off

1348
01:20:22,016 --> 01:20:22,528
You know

1349
01:20:22,784 --> 01:20:23,552
So it is

1350
01:20:23,808 --> 01:20:24,832
It is

1351
01:20:25,088 --> 01:20:26,112
Unfortunately yeah yeah

1352
01:20:27,136 --> 01:20:29,184
We don't you know I mean

1353
01:20:29,440 --> 01:20:30,464
It is still important

1354
01:20:30,976 --> 01:20:34,048
To bring that up so I'm glad you did

1355
01:20:34,304 --> 01:20:35,072
At the same time

1356
01:20:35,584 --> 01:20:38,656
Alex is what he in

1357
01:20:38,912 --> 01:20:43,264
So Alex gets into this we talked about a black lives matter protest

1358
01:20:47,360 --> 01:20:49,920
What to do about Australia

1359
01:20:50,688 --> 01:20:51,712
This is the official backlight

1360
01:20:52,992 --> 01:20:53,504
Melbourne

1361
01:20:56,576 --> 01:20:57,088
The area

1362
01:20:57,344 --> 01:20:58,624
Pizza population

1363
01:21:03,232 --> 01:21:03,744
Allowed

1364
01:21:06,048 --> 01:21:07,072
Their job are there racist

1365
01:21:10,656 --> 01:21:16,800
First things first Alex's describing black people in Melbourne

1366
01:21:21,408 --> 01:21:23,456
To tell him about what happened to the Aborigines in Mowry

1367
01:21:23,712 --> 01:21:27,296
Don't have racism in Australia cuz it's all white

1368
01:21:27,552 --> 01:21:30,880
There is literally no other way to get those comments

1369
01:21:31,136 --> 01:21:32,672
Example of white nationalist

1370
01:21:33,184 --> 01:21:36,768
Alex says that Melbourne Police Department is mostly minorities

1371
01:21:37,280 --> 01:21:40,608
I've no idea where he's getting that information from and I strongly suspect

1372
01:21:40,864 --> 01:21:41,376
He's making it up

1373
01:21:41,888 --> 01:21:48,032
I was able to find a 2008 analysis of the Victoria police forces which Melbourne is a port

1374
01:21:49,312 --> 01:21:50,080
Show a lot of diversity

1375
01:21:50,848 --> 01:21:53,920
Victoria police's predominantly in Australia

1376
01:21:54,176 --> 01:21:54,688
Police force

1377
01:21:54,944 --> 01:21:57,248
It has an over-representation of English-speaking

1378
01:21:57,504 --> 01:22:01,088
Can countries and under-representation of

1379
01:22:01,344 --> 01:22:02,880
English speaking minorities

1380
01:22:03,392 --> 01:22:09,536
In 2006 there were 9037 australian-born officers in the Victoria Police compared to

1381
01:22:09,792 --> 01:22:11,584
From northern African countries

1382
01:22:11,840 --> 01:22:14,144
25 from South African countries

1383
01:22:14,400 --> 01:22:16,448
And 17 from Southwest Asian ones

1384
01:22:17,216 --> 01:22:20,288
This is in contrast to 698 from other English

1385
01:22:20,800 --> 01:22:22,592
Countries predominantly from the UK

1386
01:22:23,104 --> 01:22:28,736
These numbers are low even when you look in terms of proportions of the population is still under representation

1387
01:22:28,992 --> 01:22:29,760
Today's staggering

1388
01:22:30,272 --> 01:22:30,784
The Great

1389
01:22:31,296 --> 01:22:32,832
It's almost like fashion

1390
01:22:33,088 --> 01:22:33,600
Just love being caught

1391
01:22:34,624 --> 01:22:38,720
I was able to find another analysis from 1979 with showbiz

1392
01:22:38,976 --> 01:22:45,120
If we add the Australian and British categories together we find that all forces are between 94 and 98 +

1393
01:22:45,376 --> 01:22:51,520
Anglo-Saxon

1394
01:22:51,776 --> 01:22:57,408
Some progress has been made in 2008

1395
01:22:57,664 --> 01:22:58,176
Still showing

1396
01:22:59,712 --> 01:23:02,528
Kind of under-representation that was marked

1397
01:23:02,784 --> 01:23:04,576
Pain in the 1979

1398
01:23:04,832 --> 01:23:06,624
Analysis

1399
01:23:07,136 --> 01:23:11,232
Probably unlikely since 2008 it's become majority-minority

1400
01:23:12,512 --> 01:23:13,280
Ludacris ride

1401
01:23:13,536 --> 01:23:17,376
But I mean that's also

1402
01:23:17,888 --> 01:23:18,400
Like

1403
01:23:20,704 --> 01:23:23,008
The incremental approach isn't cut

1404
01:23:23,520 --> 01:23:24,032
Run it has

1405
01:23:24,288 --> 01:23:26,080
Cut it cut it

1406
01:23:30,688 --> 01:23:32,736
We're still at 85%

1407
01:23:35,552 --> 01:23:37,600
Incremental should probably

1408
01:23:37,856 --> 01:23:39,392
Not the best way to approach thing

1409
01:23:39,648 --> 01:23:42,720
Incremental things that are solving the wrong problem

1410
01:23:44,512 --> 01:23:45,280
The way to go

1411
01:23:45,536 --> 01:23:49,120
So I can play

1412
01:23:49,632 --> 01:23:53,984
Minorities

1413
01:23:54,496 --> 01:23:55,776
Also it doesn't really matter

1414
01:23:56,544 --> 01:24:01,408
Delores Jones Brown the founder of the center on Race crime and Justice at the John Jay College

1415
01:24:01,664 --> 01:24:02,432
Criminal justice

1416
01:24:02,688 --> 01:24:05,760
Accountability project

1417
01:24:06,016 --> 01:24:11,648
There's a bit of naivete that if you have an officer of color that officer Canton Rachel profile

1418
01:24:12,416 --> 01:24:14,976
And I think all the evidence suggests that it is not the case

1419
01:24:15,744 --> 01:24:18,560
John Brown goes on to express

1420
01:24:18,816 --> 01:24:24,960
It's eating places primarily likely a result of the culture of police departments as opposed to the individual

1421
01:24:25,472 --> 01:24:25,984
Officers

1422
01:24:26,752 --> 01:24:31,872
The police accountability project also cited a 2004 National research Council study which said

1423
01:24:32,128 --> 01:24:35,200
There is no credible evidence that officers of different racial or

1424
01:24:35,456 --> 01:24:37,504
Make background perform differently during interaction

1425
01:24:38,016 --> 01:24:38,528
Citizens

1426
01:24:39,040 --> 01:24:41,088
Simply because of race or ethnicity

1427
01:24:41,856 --> 01:24:44,928
If you're going to have a police department it's good to have them not all these

1428
01:24:45,184 --> 01:24:46,208
One demographic group

1429
01:24:46,464 --> 01:24:52,608
Simple Act of increasing representative diversity is going to solve the underlying problems of police Sevilla

1430
01:24:52,864 --> 01:24:53,376
Directions

1431
01:24:53,888 --> 01:24:56,448
You're very naive and it's not the

1432
01:24:56,704 --> 01:24:58,240
Primary problem to be solved

1433
01:24:58,752 --> 01:25:00,544
I mean the police are trained now

1434
01:25:00,800 --> 01:25:01,824
As a military

1435
01:25:02,336 --> 01:25:06,688
Yes send an army into wherever it

1436
01:25:06,944 --> 01:25:09,760
The soldiers are just because they're different you know

1437
01:25:10,016 --> 01:25:12,576
From different backgrounds doesn't mean they're not all trained to be soldiers

1438
01:25:12,832 --> 01:25:13,856
Who take orders

1439
01:25:14,112 --> 01:25:16,672
And do that same s*** it's it's

1440
01:25:18,208 --> 01:25:20,512
It's the fact that they are essentially an invading Force

1441
01:25:22,048 --> 01:25:25,376
It is the the bottom of the bottom line

1442
01:25:25,632 --> 01:25:26,912
Salting the wrong

1443
01:25:27,168 --> 01:25:27,680
Problem

1444
01:25:27,936 --> 01:25:28,704
No

1445
01:25:29,728 --> 01:25:30,496
Good

1446
01:25:31,008 --> 01:25:32,288
You shouldn't have

1447
01:25:32,544 --> 01:25:33,568
Complete

1448
01:25:33,824 --> 01:25:39,456
Uniformity of background or

1449
01:25:39,968 --> 01:25:45,600
I need your age group or gender

1450
01:25:45,856 --> 01:25:47,648
I don't I don't think that's good

1451
01:25:48,160 --> 01:25:51,744
What is follow me people who are allowed to be librarians

1452
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:52,512
We're Polynesian

1453
01:25:53,024 --> 01:25:57,632
When that be weird things that be like a Pokemon world where everybody is

1454
01:25:58,400 --> 01:25:59,936
So in the next place we learn

1455
01:26:00,192 --> 01:26:04,288
Physically interesting cuz I see is ours trying to ship

1456
01:26:04,544 --> 01:26:09,152
Black lives matter and societal unrest paper narrative

1457
01:26:09,408 --> 01:26:10,432
Into being

1458
01:26:12,480 --> 01:26:14,272
I think is interesting because it doesn't

1459
01:26:14,528 --> 01:26:18,112
It doesn't work for the way Alex categorizes villain

1460
01:26:18,624 --> 01:26:20,928
But he's trying to get the stupid thing to do

1461
01:26:25,536 --> 01:26:26,048
Black babies

1462
01:26:27,584 --> 01:26:28,352
Your babies

1463
01:26:28,864 --> 01:26:29,632
Your ass up to

1464
01:26:35,776 --> 01:26:36,800
Run buy online

1465
01:26:47,552 --> 01:26:49,088
Everything's going on that we've not

1466
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:50,112
When did The Big Mac

1467
01:26:59,072 --> 01:27:01,376
Yep

1468
01:27:01,632 --> 01:27:02,144
To like

Sidelines Soros Soros Meritus

1470
01:27:06,496 --> 01:27:11,872
I don't I don't I don't think it works very well I don't think his audience is going to be able to

1471
01:27:12,128 --> 01:27:12,896
Follow the bread

1472
01:27:13,152 --> 01:27:17,760
But all I heard is all I heard in my head was just a voice

1473
01:27:18,016 --> 01:27:18,528
Voice Yukon

1474
01:27:18,784 --> 01:27:21,600
Stop stop

1475
01:27:21,856 --> 01:27:24,672
I know this feels good but it don't

1476
01:27:26,976 --> 01:27:31,840
Alex at the beginning of this episode was bragging about I was going to take calls and take so many calls

1477
01:27:32,352 --> 01:27:32,864
Technical

1478
01:27:33,120 --> 01:27:33,632
Talkin ever to go

1479
01:27:33,888 --> 01:27:34,400
It's called

1480
01:27:35,680 --> 01:27:37,728
5 total something in that ballpark

1481
01:27:38,496 --> 01:27:39,008
First Call

1482
01:27:39,264 --> 01:27:40,032
Northern Ireland

1483
01:27:40,288 --> 01:27:41,568
And this guy

1484
01:27:42,848 --> 01:27:43,616
Not good

1485
01:27:49,504 --> 01:27:51,552
Nevada terzin researchers

1486
01:27:52,576 --> 01:27:53,600
Star video

1487
01:27:55,136 --> 01:27:57,696
Chopped explaining all the crap

1488
01:27:59,232 --> 01:28:01,280
Is true that Obama

1489
01:28:01,792 --> 01:28:02,816
Executive order

1490
01:28:17,920 --> 01:28:18,432
He presents

1491
01:28:24,320 --> 01:28:26,112
They would all be done

1492
01:28:26,624 --> 01:28:27,904
You're absolutely right at

1493
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:33,536
Tubidy

1494
01:28:34,048 --> 01:28:38,656
Notice our Fox News

1495
01:28:40,960 --> 01:28:41,472
The troubles he was

1496
01:28:41,728 --> 01:28:46,848
Ganttic breach of the First Amendment

1497
01:28:47,104 --> 01:28:52,992
Caribou Properties broadcasters on propaganda and contact

1498
01:28:53,248 --> 01:28:58,880
Far worse than Twitter Banning someone because it's government forcing speech

1499
01:29:00,160 --> 01:29:01,696
I care about is pretending

1500
01:29:01,952 --> 01:29:08,096
The tution always just been a costume

1501
01:29:08,352 --> 01:29:09,376
Principal

1502
01:29:09,632 --> 01:29:15,008
Expression of his anger at an increasingly integrated and connected

1503
01:29:15,264 --> 01:29:18,336
We're people like him don't have a monopoly on social capital

1504
01:29:18,592 --> 01:29:23,456
That's all that's going on it's pathetic

1505
01:29:24,224 --> 01:29:30,368
Why did you throw the hammer into the TV but the nice man was talking he was telling us all doubt if

1506
01:29:30,624 --> 01:29:31,136
Feel

1507
01:29:32,160 --> 01:29:32,928
God dammit

1508
01:29:37,536 --> 01:29:41,888
Government-controlled media First Amendment

1509
01:29:42,400 --> 01:29:44,192
What what

1510
01:29:44,448 --> 01:29:47,776
Because of this Northern Irish British nationalist I will

1511
01:29:48,032 --> 01:29:49,824
Trump to take over the media

1512
01:29:50,080 --> 01:29:54,944
Another thought is very dumb

1513
01:29:56,480 --> 01:29:58,016
Vitamin Water

1514
01:30:05,440 --> 01:30:06,208
People say enough

1515
01:30:11,584 --> 01:30:12,096
The card

1516
01:30:12,864 --> 01:30:13,376
Is enough

1517
01:30:14,656 --> 01:30:17,984
The check and then I watch your show every day religiously

1518
01:30:30,016 --> 01:30:31,040
Incredibly

1519
01:30:31,552 --> 01:30:37,696
Illuminati card game and protect these cards are acceptable

1520
01:30:37,952 --> 01:30:39,744
Godzilla tires

1521
01:30:40,512 --> 01:30:44,096
There's a card in the deck it's titled enough is enough which depicts a guy yelling

1522
01:30:44,352 --> 01:30:47,936
But there's no indication

1523
01:30:48,448 --> 01:30:54,336
The effect of the card is to clear out all Zack paralysis or freeze effect that have been played against you

1524
01:30:54,592 --> 01:30:57,152
You can't move your plot forward in that turn

1525
01:30:57,664 --> 01:31:03,808
The angry yelling person on the card is basically depicting someone who's had enough of these that paralysis or freeze effects 04

1526
01:31:04,064 --> 01:31:05,600
Because enough is enough

1527
01:31:06,368 --> 01:31:09,952
It's a ridiculous stretch to pretend that this is Trump or that there's any kind of

1528
01:31:10,208 --> 01:31:10,976
Meaning in here

1529
01:31:11,232 --> 01:31:13,536
I was perusing these blogs that make these arguments

1530
01:31:13,792 --> 01:31:19,936
The same people who speculate about this also claimed that was a prediction of the Boston

1531
01:31:21,984 --> 01:31:28,128
They also claim the Deep card predicted the Deepwater Horizon spill

1532
01:31:28,384 --> 01:31:34,528
Exxon Valdez spill happened prior to the game's release

1533
01:31:39,392 --> 01:31:44,256
Everybody saw after the Exxon Valdez

1534
01:31:44,512 --> 01:31:46,816
Steps to make sure that this never occurred to

1535
01:31:47,072 --> 01:31:51,680
So stupid

1536
01:31:51,936 --> 01:31:52,704
Of the

1537
01:31:52,960 --> 01:31:53,728
Conspiracies

1538
01:31:53,984 --> 01:31:54,496
That

1539
01:31:55,008 --> 01:31:56,032
AR

1540
01:31:56,544 --> 01:31:57,056
Floated

1541
01:32:01,664 --> 01:32:02,432
I wish you'd just

1542
01:32:04,480 --> 01:32:06,528
I mean it's frustrating and boring but

1543
01:32:07,040 --> 01:32:09,856
Sometimes like all right let's do this

1544
01:32:10,368 --> 01:32:11,904
A time traveler

1545
01:32:12,160 --> 01:32:13,184
Ifucking wish

1546
01:32:13,440 --> 01:32:14,208
Cut out this clip

1547
01:32:14,464 --> 01:32:17,024
It starts talking about Steve Jackson games

1548
01:32:17,280 --> 01:32:23,424
A lot of stuff looks like me either

1549
01:32:25,984 --> 01:32:28,032
Did this guy have time machine

1550
01:32:28,544 --> 01:32:34,688
F****** do that Alex get into improve its Steve Jackson has a time machine

1551
01:32:36,480 --> 01:32:38,272
Takes out a single verse to Target

1552
01:32:38,528 --> 01:32:39,296
He just pulls out

1553
01:32:41,856 --> 01:32:44,672
And here's how I'm going to prove exactly what this is

1554
01:32:44,928 --> 01:32:51,072
Alright Jackson angels are up there Angels be flying around anyways

1555
01:32:53,376 --> 01:32:59,520
Yeah I would love it it's like some kind of man in the High Castle

1556
01:32:59,776 --> 01:33:00,288
God

1557
01:33:00,800 --> 01:33:01,312
Anyway

1558
01:33:01,824 --> 01:33:05,920
Talking about some other news stories about the National Guard being

1559
01:33:06,176 --> 01:33:08,480
Not welcome in d.c. hotels

1560
01:33:11,552 --> 01:33:12,576
Void d.c.

1561
01:33:12,832 --> 01:33:13,600
Motel

1562
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:21,280
1200 confirm

1563
01:33:22,048 --> 01:33:23,584
What do we say we don't want your

1564
01:33:24,096 --> 01:33:24,608
Find here

1565
01:33:26,400 --> 01:33:28,960
Corporations are we don't want police

1566
01:33:29,472 --> 01:33:31,520
We don't want military around Legos

1567
01:33:32,544 --> 01:33:33,568
Pulled all of it

1568
01:33:34,080 --> 01:33:34,848
That policeman

1569
01:33:37,920 --> 01:33:38,944
He want

1570
01:33:40,992 --> 01:33:41,760
We want

1571
01:33:46,368 --> 01:33:52,512
Students repeating inaccurate stories a trace back to propaganda campaigns Push by Trump social media Guy Brad parscale

1572
01:33:58,656 --> 01:34:03,776
The idea they were putting out

1573
01:34:05,056 --> 01:34:05,568
Which isn't true

1574
01:34:06,080 --> 01:34:12,224
Email the right-wing lawyers were misrepresented to clarify

1575
01:34:12,736 --> 01:34:14,016
We did not pull our product

1576
01:34:14,272 --> 01:34:20,160
From shells rather paused digital marketing activities as well

1577
01:34:20,416 --> 01:34:22,976
Show sensitivity for the tragic events of the United States

1578
01:34:23,744 --> 01:34:28,096
Generations of children of love playing with assessing our Lego City Line

1579
01:34:28,352 --> 01:34:28,864
Stanton or collection

1580
01:34:29,376 --> 01:34:35,520
Given the tragic events of the United States over the past 10 days we positive digital marketing assets that could be perceived as incense

1581
01:34:35,776 --> 01:34:37,312
If promoted at this time

1582
01:34:37,568 --> 01:34:38,336
Statement from Lego

1583
01:34:38,848 --> 01:34:40,128
We read the room

1584
01:34:40,384 --> 01:34:46,528
A company correctly recognized that now is not the time for

1585
01:34:46,784 --> 01:34:47,808
To come off as a little girl

1586
01:34:48,576 --> 01:34:52,416
They requested affiliate links they had advertising this product

1587
01:34:52,672 --> 01:34:55,744
Ad campaign for said products you can still buy them at the store

1588
01:34:56,256 --> 01:35:01,632
I want you probably still call this virtue signaling but it's pretty telling that he doesn't even know what the actual story is

1589
01:35:01,888 --> 01:35:07,008
You only knows the fake outrage bait version that he's picked up from fellow right when bulshit artist

1590
01:35:07,520 --> 01:35:11,104
And what he says the left is mad that they're not virtue signaling enough

1591
01:35:13,664 --> 01:35:15,968
Crystal like a list of random tweets

1592
01:35:18,528 --> 01:35:19,296
You got the left

1593
01:35:19,552 --> 01:35:25,696
You got a few tweets I didn't recognize any of the accounts

1594
01:35:26,464 --> 01:35:28,000
Left everything in a meeting

1595
01:35:28,256 --> 01:35:34,400
Leftist online whatever

1596
01:35:34,912 --> 01:35:35,936
Coffee

1597
01:35:36,192 --> 01:35:42,336
Triggered by people having a position on Twitter

1598
01:35:42,592 --> 01:35:44,640
Accounts with like $100

1599
01:35:47,712 --> 01:35:49,504
It takes scouring

1600
01:35:54,368 --> 01:35:58,464
Utah National Guard out of proportion

1601
01:35:58,976 --> 01:36:05,120
DC mayor Muriel Bowser requested that Trump remove Federal and Military troops have been sent to the city because they were

1602
01:36:06,912 --> 01:36:08,960
Absolutely not going to lead with the escalation

1603
01:36:09,472 --> 01:36:13,312
She was cleared the troops could stay in the DC Hotel

1604
01:36:14,336 --> 01:36:15,872
DC will not pay for them

1605
01:36:16,128 --> 01:36:16,640
To be housed

1606
01:36:17,408 --> 01:36:20,224
This led to them being relocated from one hotel to another

1607
01:36:20,736 --> 01:36:23,808
US Army Master Sergeant W Michael

1608
01:36:24,064 --> 01:36:26,368
Ksl-tv

1609
01:36:26,880 --> 01:36:32,512
Some National Guard responders were quartering in hotel accommodations which had pre-existing contractual agreements with the district

1610
01:36:33,024 --> 01:36:37,376
Out of respect for existing agreements those facilities

1611
01:36:37,632 --> 01:36:38,912
Do service members have

1612
01:36:39,168 --> 01:36:39,680
Relocated

1613
01:36:40,704 --> 01:36:42,240
What is ultimately comes down to

1614
01:36:42,496 --> 01:36:46,336
Is the DC already a contract with these hotels for National Guard members who responded

1615
01:36:46,592 --> 01:36:47,360
Thanks covid-19

1616
01:36:47,616 --> 01:36:51,456
This contract did not apply to guard members who were there to respond to the protest

1617
01:36:52,480 --> 01:36:54,272
DC didn't evict anyone

1618
01:36:54,528 --> 01:37:00,672
Did you stop payment for the housing because they hadn't agreed to take it on and as a result the effective guard members had to find other lodging

1619
01:37:01,440 --> 01:37:03,232
There's no Scandal here there's no implication

1620
01:37:03,488 --> 01:37:06,048
The third amendment like Twitter has been having fun with

1621
01:37:06,304 --> 01:37:08,096
It's just a bureaucratic billing issue

1622
01:37:08,608 --> 01:37:10,912
Alex is missing

1623
01:37:11,168 --> 01:37:11,680
As well

1624
01:37:12,192 --> 01:37:18,336
200 was the number of National Guard members from Utah that had to move hotels which Senator Mike Lee was very upset about

1625
01:37:19,104 --> 01:37:23,200
12:00 was the number of d.c. National Guard members who were activated

1626
01:37:23,456 --> 01:37:25,248
Is declaration that DC wasn't going

1627
01:37:25,504 --> 01:37:29,856
5100 people who work

1628
01:37:30,112 --> 01:37:34,464
200 numbers only relevant cuz bike leaves from Utah made a big deal out of this

1629
01:37:34,720 --> 01:37:35,488
Play the victim

1630
01:37:35,744 --> 01:37:37,024
My really embarrassing way

1631
01:37:37,536 --> 01:37:40,352
I don't see I don't see instances of like

1632
01:37:40,864 --> 01:37:43,936
Governors of other states who had their guard activated now

1633
01:37:44,192 --> 01:37:45,984
I know where we're at

1634
01:37:46,752 --> 01:37:47,264
Whatever

1635
01:37:48,032 --> 01:37:49,056
But he's got a wine if you're

1636
01:37:55,200 --> 01:37:55,712
We come

1637
01:37:55,968 --> 01:37:57,504
Towards the end of this episode

1638
01:37:57,760 --> 01:37:58,272
And

1639
01:37:58,784 --> 01:38:00,320
I've got to say

1640
01:38:01,088 --> 01:38:04,672
I have one piece of bad news

1641
01:38:04,928 --> 01:38:06,208
Something else that happened

1642
01:38:06,720 --> 01:38:10,048
Bad news out of the way

1643
01:38:10,304 --> 01:38:11,072
Corrected Alex

1644
01:38:12,352 --> 01:38:13,632
How awesome is bolsonaro

1645
01:38:16,448 --> 01:38:19,008
So Alex is finally figured out how to pronounce bolsonaro

1646
01:38:19,264 --> 01:38:24,128
Just took the day off Ali's doing office

1647
01:38:24,640 --> 01:38:30,784
This f****** how can you praise bolsonaro even the right-wing that dropped bolsonaro up and Brazil is like

1648
01:38:32,064 --> 01:38:38,208
Murderer because his son Alex at ePacket

1649
01:38:38,720 --> 01:38:41,024
Keep our soundboard despite anything

1650
01:38:43,328 --> 01:38:45,376
Bolsonaro Captain called Brazil Trump

1651
01:38:45,888 --> 01:38:49,472
So Alex just guys got to be awesome

1652
01:38:49,728 --> 01:38:50,496
You don't know anything

1653
01:38:52,032 --> 01:38:53,824
Next clip

1654
01:38:54,080 --> 01:38:54,848
4

1655
01:38:55,360 --> 01:38:59,200
Sphynx is saying Outlaw the Democratic Party

1656
01:38:59,456 --> 01:39:03,040
Nice

1657
01:39:03,808 --> 01:39:05,856
Neglected garbage needs to be

1658
01:39:07,392 --> 01:39:08,160
Capri's Pizza

1659
01:39:11,232 --> 01:39:12,256
Outlawed

1660
01:39:20,448 --> 01:39:24,800
So I'm sure Alex just thinks he's calling for the political party he doesn't like to be outlawed which is

1661
01:39:28,640 --> 01:39:32,480
Liberalism doesn't mean liberal or democrat or anything like that

1662
01:39:32,992 --> 01:39:37,856
I don't have much love to quote encyclopedias so here's the definition of liberalism from Encyclopedia Britannica

1663
01:39:38,112 --> 01:39:38,624
Quotes

1664
01:39:38,880 --> 01:39:40,160
A political Doctrine

1665
01:39:40,416 --> 01:39:44,512
Protecting and enhancing the freedom of the individual Central problem of politic

1666
01:39:45,280 --> 01:39:46,304
Liberals pepper

1667
01:39:46,560 --> 01:39:51,168
We believe that government is necessary to protect individuals from being harmed by others

1668
01:39:51,424 --> 01:39:55,008
But they also recognize that government itself can pose a threat to Liberty

1669
01:39:56,032 --> 01:39:57,312
The philosopher John Locke came up with

1670
01:39:57,568 --> 01:40:00,896
Concept is defined as a system based on

1671
01:40:01,152 --> 01:40:01,664
Contract

1672
01:40:01,920 --> 01:40:03,200
Where individuals have rights

1673
01:40:03,456 --> 01:40:03,968
The government's

1674
01:40:04,224 --> 01:40:04,736
Cannot vile

1675
01:40:05,760 --> 01:40:07,808
When Alex gets on Aaron argues that liberalism

1676
01:40:08,064 --> 01:40:11,648
Should be outlawed for a totalitarian

1677
01:40:12,416 --> 01:40:15,232
For one that's not based on the concept of individual liberty

1678
01:40:15,744 --> 01:40:20,352
I'm sure that's not what Alex means no idea what the words he says mean

1679
01:40:20,864 --> 01:40:22,144
That is what he's advocating

1680
01:40:22,656 --> 01:40:25,472
And it makes it all the more hilarious when I tell you this Jordan

1681
01:40:25,728 --> 01:40:30,848
Less than a minute before he did that himself a classical liberal he says this

1682
01:40:38,016 --> 01:40:44,160
Don't say don't say I have a don't say anything

1683
01:40:44,416 --> 01:40:45,440
This introduces

1684
01:40:45,696 --> 01:40:47,232
Kind of what I would describe as

1685
01:40:47,488 --> 01:40:48,768
A segment where Alex

1686
01:40:49,792 --> 01:40:51,584
Tries to play with words

1687
01:40:51,840 --> 01:40:52,864
A little bit

1688
01:40:53,120 --> 01:40:54,912
He goes on a pond run

1689
01:40:55,168 --> 01:40:57,216
Already box

1690
01:40:57,472 --> 01:40:58,752
This liberalism

1691
01:40:59,008 --> 01:41:05,152
That he's he's bragged about his vocabulary and then misuse the word liberalism

1692
01:41:05,408 --> 01:41:06,432
His words are fine a

1693
01:41:10,016 --> 01:41:10,784
Oligarch

1694
01:41:12,320 --> 01:41:12,832
Oh no

1695
01:41:13,856 --> 01:41:14,368
A mob

1696
01:41:18,976 --> 01:41:20,000
Mob rule

1697
01:41:20,256 --> 01:41:21,024
Is the role of government

1698
01:41:23,072 --> 01:41:23,584
Some people

1699
01:41:34,080 --> 01:41:34,592
Wow

1700
01:41:38,944 --> 01:41:41,248
That was a perfect

1701
01:41:41,504 --> 01:41:47,648
Okay look at the war called

1702
01:41:47,904 --> 01:41:53,024
Definition of an oligarchy

1703
01:41:53,792 --> 01:41:58,656
If you can solve Merriam-Webster definition of oligarchy government by the few

1704
01:41:58,912 --> 01:42:00,192
Which is kind of the opposite of Marlboro

1705
01:42:00,960 --> 01:42:06,080
What happened here is that Alex didn't realize was actually reading the definition of the word aqua

1706
01:42:06,336 --> 01:42:07,360
Until he was halfway

1707
01:42:07,616 --> 01:42:08,128
Through it

1708
01:42:08,384 --> 01:42:11,200
How many just decided to cover his tracks by saying it goes off

1709
01:42:11,712 --> 01:42:14,016
It's an easy mistake to make when you dump repair

1710
01:42:14,272 --> 01:42:15,040
Just talking out of your ass

1711
01:42:15,296 --> 01:42:16,576
I mean go to work to do looks

1712
01:42:16,832 --> 01:42:17,600
Similar

1713
01:42:21,952 --> 01:42:25,280
I'd like to figure out exactly what happened here and I did get to the bottom of this

1714
01:42:25,792 --> 01:42:31,936
It's just reading the definition of autocracy from the top of its Wikipedia page

1715
01:42:32,192 --> 01:42:32,704
In the middle of it

1716
01:42:33,728 --> 01:42:38,080
Greek in College Point out

1717
01:42:38,336 --> 01:42:40,640
The end of these two words are a sure sign

1718
01:42:42,432 --> 01:42:44,736
Walker cnz crossy

1719
01:42:44,992 --> 01:42:46,016
Which comes from the Greek

1720
01:42:47,808 --> 01:42:51,136
Root word in democracy or aristocracy or theocracy

1721
01:42:51,392 --> 01:42:54,208
It means power in Greek which is reflected in

1722
01:42:54,464 --> 01:42:55,232
Each of these terms

1723
01:42:55,488 --> 01:42:56,512
Up social structure

1724
01:42:57,280 --> 01:43:01,120
Democracy is where the crotches or power is rooted in the demos

1725
01:43:01,376 --> 01:43:01,888
The people

1726
01:43:02,144 --> 01:43:05,984
Aristocracy has no power in the aristos or the excellent

1727
01:43:06,240 --> 01:43:08,800
Meaning the power lies in the hands of the elite

1728
01:43:09,568 --> 01:43:12,640
Theocracy is where power is rooted in the idea

1729
01:43:13,152 --> 01:43:15,712
Forgot

1730
01:43:15,968 --> 01:43:16,480
Control Society

1731
01:43:17,504 --> 01:43:18,272
Conversely

1732
01:43:18,528 --> 01:43:20,064
Oligarchy and xanarchy

1733
01:43:20,320 --> 01:43:21,600
Which comes from the word Arco

1734
01:43:22,112 --> 01:43:22,880
Which means to rule

1735
01:43:23,648 --> 01:43:27,488
Words that end in R key typically reflect the type of rulers there are in assist

1736
01:43:28,768 --> 01:43:29,536
He comes from

1737
01:43:29,792 --> 01:43:31,328
Switch translates to the few

1738
01:43:31,840 --> 01:43:35,424
It's just descriptive of a system where these few rule the money

1739
01:43:35,936 --> 01:43:41,568
Aristocracy meritocracy or theocracy or subsets of oligarchy systems because the rule of the few

1740
01:43:41,824 --> 01:43:42,848
Take many different forms

1741
01:43:43,360 --> 01:43:45,408
Depending on how

1742
01:43:45,664 --> 01:43:51,808
Find a particular society Alex has a big vocabulary to Dan Bon

1743
01:43:52,064 --> 01:43:53,088
No other languages

1744
01:43:53,344 --> 01:43:59,488
Who even speaks English

1745
01:43:59,744 --> 01:44:00,768
Pictures of War

1746
01:44:01,024 --> 01:44:02,304
Is what you're doing

1747
01:44:02,816 --> 01:44:05,632
Examples of this linguistic patterns

1748
01:44:06,144 --> 01:44:06,656
Or the apps

1749
01:44:06,912 --> 01:44:07,424
Since of a ruler

1750
01:44:08,960 --> 01:44:14,080
Which is a system where rulers and officials are selected from a random sampling of the population

1751
01:44:14,336 --> 01:44:15,872
More of a system where the ruler

1752
01:44:19,968 --> 01:44:22,784
Monarchy is a system where there is power in the hands of an individual

1753
01:44:23,296 --> 01:44:26,880
If you want to break down more stuff and words

1754
01:44:27,392 --> 01:44:31,744
It's important to remember that words mean things when the system is described

1755
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:33,280
Crotches or crossing

1756
01:44:33,792 --> 01:44:34,560
It's disgusting

1757
01:44:34,816 --> 01:44:36,352
Power derives from

1758
01:44:36,864 --> 01:44:38,656
In democracy the source of power is

1759
01:44:38,912 --> 01:44:41,728
The people chakra see it's God

1760
01:44:41,984 --> 01:44:45,568
It's the mob or in Greek which is

1761
01:44:45,824 --> 01:44:47,104
For a crowd or the rebel

1762
01:44:48,128 --> 01:44:50,176
When the system is described with a word ending in

1763
01:44:50,432 --> 01:44:50,944
Narco

1764
01:44:52,736 --> 01:44:55,296
It's describing who actually is in a power position

1765
01:44:56,064 --> 01:44:57,856
Oligarchy has a few

1766
01:44:58,112 --> 01:44:59,392
In positions of power

1767
01:44:59,904 --> 01:45:01,184
The king or queen in a position

1768
01:45:01,440 --> 01:45:03,232
The power

1769
01:45:03,488 --> 01:45:04,256
In a position of power

1770
01:45:04,768 --> 01:45:10,144
Basic linguistic distinction

1771
01:45:10,656 --> 01:45:14,496
It's staggering

1772
01:45:14,752 --> 01:45:15,776
For 20-plus years

1773
01:45:16,032 --> 01:45:19,360
Eddie doesn't grasp this very Elementary think about how political systems are

1774
01:45:20,384 --> 01:45:26,528
Really f****** sad and probably not a sadist pretending to know the definition of oligarchy oligarchy

1775
01:45:26,784 --> 01:45:28,320
Clock receiver

1776
01:45:28,576 --> 01:45:29,856
Mistake mid definition

1777
01:45:30,112 --> 01:45:31,904
Pretending

1778
01:45:32,160 --> 01:45:34,464
That's a pathetic level disregard for accuracy

1779
01:45:34,976 --> 01:45:36,768
I'm honestly not very surprising

1780
01:45:37,024 --> 01:45:37,536
That's just

1781
01:45:37,792 --> 01:45:38,304
Is comically bad

1782
01:45:40,608 --> 01:45:41,888
For anyone

1783
01:45:42,144 --> 01:45:43,168
Serious about Alec

1784
01:45:43,424 --> 01:45:44,448
Exercise

1785
01:45:44,960 --> 01:45:45,984
Kind of think that Alex

1786
01:45:46,240 --> 01:45:47,008
Might be right

1787
01:45:47,264 --> 01:45:50,080
That's the kind of thing that I would really like them to understand

1788
01:45:50,592 --> 01:45:52,384
He has no idea what he's talking about

1789
01:45:52,640 --> 01:45:55,968
Almost all the time

1790
01:45:56,224 --> 01:45:59,808
And sometimes really f****** steps

1791
01:46:00,320 --> 01:46:02,368
He doesn't understand the definition

1792
01:46:02,624 --> 01:46:08,000
Articles

1793
01:46:08,256 --> 01:46:09,280
This one business pretty

1794
01:46:15,168 --> 01:46:21,312
I enjoy it because I also really enjoy the opportunity to explain

1795
01:46:21,568 --> 01:46:23,616
I think it's really interesting the way that these

1796
01:46:23,872 --> 01:46:26,944
Suffixes two words

1797
01:46:27,200 --> 01:46:28,224
In terms of what

1798
01:46:28,480 --> 01:46:30,272
They're describing and how

1799
01:46:30,528 --> 01:46:32,832
You can find these patterns within the word

1800
01:46:33,088 --> 01:46:34,880
Yeah it's important if you want to understand

1801
01:46:35,392 --> 01:46:36,160
What is the difference

1802
01:46:36,416 --> 01:46:39,744
Between democracy

1803
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:43,584
What is the fundamental difference

1804
01:46:43,840 --> 01:46:47,936
Glitches

1805
01:46:48,448 --> 01:46:50,496
If you understand it it helps you understand

1806
01:46:51,008 --> 01:46:52,288
What things mean

1807
01:46:52,800 --> 01:46:57,152
Recognized on a fundamental level first of all the wrong word

1808
01:46:57,408 --> 01:46:59,712
Oligarchy is a narc

1809
01:47:00,736 --> 01:47:02,272
Apocracy is a cross

1810
01:47:04,320 --> 01:47:05,088
I don't know he's just very sad

1811
01:47:05,344 --> 01:47:06,880
He's very very very very

1812
01:47:08,928 --> 01:47:09,696
I do

1813
01:47:09,952 --> 01:47:10,464
Applaud

1814
01:47:10,976 --> 01:47:11,488
Sorta

1815
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:13,536
Because he goes to commercial

1816
01:47:13,792 --> 01:47:14,560
He comes back

1817
01:47:14,816 --> 01:47:16,096
And he admits

1818
01:47:17,888 --> 01:47:18,656
He sort of admit

1819
01:47:18,912 --> 01:47:20,192
Bet he got the wrong word

1820
01:47:20,448 --> 01:47:21,728
Ofloxacin

1821
01:47:26,336 --> 01:47:28,640
In the room

1822
01:47:28,896 --> 01:47:31,712
The people or the intimidation of legitimate authorities

1823
01:47:32,224 --> 01:47:36,576
How to speak from Wikipedia but he's still not

1824
01:47:36,832 --> 01:47:37,344
Correct

1825
01:47:37,600 --> 01:47:40,416
A clock received derives from polybius

1826
01:47:40,672 --> 01:47:42,208
Who was a Greek historian

1827
01:47:42,464 --> 01:47:44,512
The term was adopted by Latin

1828
01:47:44,768 --> 01:47:45,536
Millie comes from Greek

1829
01:47:48,096 --> 01:47:50,656
Alex wasn't just randomly reading that definition

1830
01:47:50,912 --> 01:47:56,032
You in the middle of a rant about how oligarchy is actually incorrect definition

1831
01:47:56,544 --> 01:48:01,152
I'm glad he's coming but it completely invalidates the prior

1832
01:48:01,408 --> 01:48:03,456
He was talkin about

1833
01:48:06,016 --> 01:48:08,832
Straight to cover his ass here and it's silly

1834
01:48:11,648 --> 01:48:12,160
Create the

1835
01:48:22,912 --> 01:48:23,424
But worried about

1836
01:48:24,704 --> 01:48:27,776
Historically accurate definitions of these words

1837
01:48:28,032 --> 01:48:29,056
Completely Escape Alex

1838
01:48:29,568 --> 01:48:34,432
Bruin Anarchy or absolutely not synonymous but is acting as if they are

1839
01:48:34,688 --> 01:48:36,736
It's entirely possible for an anarchist system

1840
01:48:36,992 --> 01:48:42,112
To be implemented in a stable way and has literally nothing to do with the signature features of ox

1841
01:48:43,136 --> 01:48:47,488
Typically autocracy is not a functional system of Affairs

1842
01:48:47,744 --> 01:48:51,840
The characterizes a. As opposed to any kind of stable working order or

1843
01:48:52,608 --> 01:48:58,496
Examples like the Salem witch trials and racialized violence like lynch mobs it looks like in real life

1844
01:48:58,752 --> 01:49:00,800
It's pretty easy to understand

1845
01:49:01,312 --> 01:49:07,456
It's just not a sustainable system

1846
01:49:07,968 --> 01:49:12,320
Reconstruction Era South workout perfect it just doesn't work

1847
01:49:12,576 --> 01:49:15,392
A great typically do not grow out of an arc

1848
01:49:16,160 --> 01:49:22,304
Many theorists believe that oligarchy is actually the natural result of not rigidly controlled social

1849
01:49:22,560 --> 01:49:23,584
Renovations as they grow

1850
01:49:24,096 --> 01:49:28,960
Eventually the size of the system will be too large for any kind of effective direct representation

1851
01:49:29,216 --> 01:49:31,264
Naturally develop

1852
01:49:31,776 --> 01:49:35,872
This is the basis of Robert Michels Theory called the iron law of oligarchy

1853
01:49:37,408 --> 01:49:37,920
Scro

1854
01:49:38,176 --> 01:49:40,736
Oligarchy

1855
01:49:41,760 --> 01:49:45,600
I'm not sure if that's accurate but that's something that a lot of people point to

1856
01:49:46,112 --> 01:49:47,392
It's a it's a pattern

1857
01:49:47,648 --> 01:49:49,184
It's a pattern displayed out whether or not you

1858
01:49:49,696 --> 01:49:50,208
Say that they

1859
01:49:50,720 --> 01:49:52,256
You know reasoning behind it is

1860
01:49:52,512 --> 01:49:53,280
Found itself

1861
01:49:53,792 --> 01:49:54,816
A repetitive thing

1862
01:49:55,072 --> 01:50:01,216
Making things up and trying to cover his ass because he realized

1863
01:50:01,472 --> 01:50:02,496
Mickey was wrong

1864
01:50:02,752 --> 01:50:04,032
Because he's too proud

1865
01:50:04,288 --> 01:50:08,128
He's such that guy you know that everybody knows that guy who no matter what

1866
01:50:08,640 --> 01:50:14,784
What I was saying was actually

1867
01:50:15,296 --> 01:50:20,672
And you are still 100 but I have a very big

1868
01:50:21,184 --> 01:50:25,792
Barry Beck

1869
01:50:26,048 --> 01:50:26,816
But now.

1870
01:50:27,072 --> 01:50:28,864
Who's dating the word

1871
01:50:30,656 --> 01:50:31,680
Too proud

1872
01:50:33,728 --> 01:50:35,264
We come to the last two

1873
01:50:36,032 --> 01:50:37,568
They're sort of around the same subject

1874
01:50:38,080 --> 01:50:41,664
Because we get to explore

1875
01:50:42,176 --> 01:50:42,944
The subject of

1876
01:50:43,200 --> 01:50:43,968
The chessboard

1877
01:50:47,808 --> 01:50:51,648
Alex did not intend to get back to the subject

1878
01:50:51,904 --> 01:50:53,440
Encircled the call

1879
01:50:53,696 --> 01:50:56,768
From a former accountant

1880
01:51:00,864 --> 01:51:01,632
Is not so thrilled

1881
01:51:01,888 --> 01:51:08,032
Alex's is worried

1882
01:51:08,288 --> 01:51:10,336
Send messages to Demons

1883
01:51:11,616 --> 01:51:12,384
And that brings me to something

1884
01:51:12,640 --> 01:51:15,200
Concerns me and that is something that your

1885
01:51:15,968 --> 01:51:17,248
Has been panning doodle

1886
01:51:18,784 --> 01:51:22,112
And putting as the central Focus instead of you multiple times now

1887
01:51:22,624 --> 01:51:23,904
And I recognize that

1888
01:51:24,160 --> 01:51:27,232
That could be used as something that devudu who done

1889
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:28,768
Surya and

1890
01:51:29,024 --> 01:51:30,816
People who have ancestor altar

1891
01:51:34,144 --> 01:51:34,912
It concerns me

1892
01:51:41,056 --> 01:51:41,568
Chess board

1893
01:51:48,992 --> 01:51:49,760
They're playing both sides

1894
01:51:53,088 --> 01:51:55,392
That's not how you play chess

1895
01:52:00,256 --> 01:52:01,280
You dumbass.

1896
01:52:03,840 --> 01:52:04,352
Do I thought

1897
01:52:07,168 --> 01:52:07,680
Kaiser in

1898
01:52:10,496 --> 01:52:11,008
Flowers

1899
01:52:11,264 --> 01:52:11,776
Delivered

1900
01:52:12,032 --> 01:52:13,568
I was setting us up

1901
01:52:14,080 --> 01:52:14,848
What a joke

1902
01:52:16,640 --> 01:52:18,176
We'll put some flowers out here

1903
01:52:19,200 --> 01:52:19,968
Execute people what's the

1904
01:52:20,480 --> 01:52:20,992
Message

1905
01:52:24,832 --> 01:52:25,344
Is all about

1906
01:52:25,856 --> 01:52:26,368
People

1907
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:32,512
All came together

1908
01:52:38,656 --> 01:52:40,192
Expressing

1909
01:52:40,704 --> 01:52:41,216
He just

1910
01:52:41,728 --> 01:52:44,288
Show some random stuff to put out there

1911
01:52:44,544 --> 01:52:46,080
B somebody would

1912
01:52:46,336 --> 01:52:48,384
Start a campaign of accusing him

1913
01:52:48,640 --> 01:52:50,688
Of doing some kind of a satanic

1914
01:52:50,944 --> 01:52:52,736
And then he could be like

1915
01:52:53,248 --> 01:52:55,040
No this is just a debit

1916
01:53:02,976 --> 01:53:05,280
Comes back to bite him in the ass

1917
01:53:05,536 --> 01:53:08,352
I wanted people to bring what they brought through it and she did

1918
01:53:08,608 --> 01:53:10,656
And now you're all flustered and what help

1919
01:53:11,936 --> 01:53:15,264
It's a joke the next Kaiser sent him flowers

1920
01:53:15,520 --> 01:53:16,288
What is it

1921
01:53:16,544 --> 01:53:17,056
Is that cuz

1922
01:53:17,312 --> 01:53:20,640
Beck's in Southaven

1923
01:53:20,896 --> 01:53:27,040
Explain

1924
01:53:27,296 --> 01:53:30,368
Process

1925
01:53:46,496 --> 01:53:49,824
First of all you do have the black and white and we know that that's been used

1926
01:53:54,688 --> 01:53:55,456
The checkerboard

1927
01:53:56,736 --> 01:53:58,016
Offering to whatever

1928
01:53:58,272 --> 01:54:01,344
Or whatever is demons whatever it is

1929
01:54:04,928 --> 01:54:05,952
Pieces flowers

1930
01:54:06,208 --> 01:54:06,976
Of course

1931
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:09,280
The flower or the Stevens

1932
01:54:09,792 --> 01:54:10,304
The most

1933
01:54:10,816 --> 01:54:11,840
Disturbing thing what is of course

1934
01:54:13,376 --> 01:54:14,144
Placed on the altar

1935
01:54:15,168 --> 01:54:16,704
So if you are an accomplice

1936
01:54:17,216 --> 01:54:18,752
Be something that you would use

1937
01:54:19,008 --> 01:54:19,520
Specifically

1938
01:54:20,032 --> 01:54:21,568
To gain the favor of

1939
01:54:22,080 --> 01:54:22,592
Demonic

1940
01:54:24,384 --> 01:54:25,408
Make me a little nervous that it's on

1941
01:54:27,456 --> 01:54:30,528
Invocations or anything like that

1942
01:54:36,416 --> 01:54:40,256
I'm really bummed

1943
01:54:40,512 --> 01:54:41,280
Alex

1944
01:54:45,120 --> 01:54:46,400
I didn't mean it

1945
01:54:49,984 --> 01:54:53,056
You can't even just accept a vulnerability of the like

1946
01:54:53,824 --> 01:54:59,456
Look you tried something a little creative creative

1947
01:54:59,712 --> 01:55:05,856
Okay I've got these flowers Mexican to me

1948
01:55:06,112 --> 01:55:09,184
My dad there's the chessboard

1949
01:55:16,096 --> 01:55:20,448
Can't do that what you're Alex because it's a tacit admission that you fail

1950
01:55:20,704 --> 01:55:21,216
Yeah

1951
01:55:21,472 --> 01:55:25,568
He's presenting that he still succeeded cuz he made something

1952
01:55:26,080 --> 01:55:31,712
Or whatever if you do things out but I accidentally

1953
01:55:38,112 --> 01:55:39,392
Exclamation

1954
01:55:39,648 --> 01:55:40,928
Inform her about why demons like

1955
01:55:41,696 --> 01:55:43,488
Sure

1956
01:55:44,512 --> 01:55:50,656
How does human sacrifices

1957
01:55:51,168 --> 01:55:52,960
That's my guess

1958
01:55:56,288 --> 01:55:56,800
Toilet

1959
01:56:01,664 --> 01:56:07,040
Disconnected broadcast not straight out of the park

1960
01:56:07,552 --> 01:56:09,088
Alex

1961
01:56:09,344 --> 01:56:11,392
Another

1962
01:56:11,648 --> 01:56:12,672
When on the bus

1963
01:56:12,928 --> 01:56:16,256
Let's just let's take a look at the win column for Alex's

1964
01:56:16,512 --> 01:56:19,840
25000 million in the win column zero in the loss

1965
01:56:21,376 --> 01:56:24,960
Spectacularly disconnected from reality

1966
01:56:25,216 --> 01:56:27,776
Important stuff that are going on in the world right now

1967
01:56:28,032 --> 01:56:29,312
That I might

1968
01:56:30,336 --> 01:56:31,360
Little bit

1969
01:56:31,872 --> 01:56:33,408
Bar in the direction of

1970
01:56:33,664 --> 01:56:38,016
Teachable moment understand

1971
01:56:39,040 --> 01:56:41,856
I mean the way I was lies the way

1972
01:56:43,392 --> 01:56:46,976
He tries to feign expertise about things

1973
01:56:48,512 --> 01:56:51,328
Like a moment that I really think

1974
01:56:51,584 --> 01:56:52,096
The most

1975
01:56:52,608 --> 01:56:53,632
Shocking for me

1976
01:56:53,888 --> 01:56:57,984
About the Bill Gates running a speed narrative

1977
01:56:58,240 --> 01:57:00,032
Because that's where you can see him like

1978
01:57:05,152 --> 01:57:06,688
He is what he did

1979
01:57:08,480 --> 01:57:09,760
It's almost like Kim

1980
01:57:10,016 --> 01:57:12,832
Resisting for a moment be giving into the momentum

1981
01:57:13,088 --> 01:57:14,880
Of his own narrative

1982
01:57:17,184 --> 01:57:19,232
I'm kind of going so if you look at it that way cuz

1983
01:57:19,488 --> 01:57:20,768
Knoebels makes it seem like he's

1984
01:57:21,024 --> 01:57:22,560
Powerless over the

1985
01:57:31,008 --> 01:57:33,056
But I also know

1986
01:57:35,360 --> 01:57:36,896
I'm not happy for him

1987
01:57:37,664 --> 01:57:38,944
What's the best excuse

1988
01:57:39,456 --> 01:57:40,736
I think it's just kind of sad

1989
01:57:41,760 --> 01:57:46,112
Until then

1990
01:57:59,168 --> 01:58:01,216
Local charity in your neighborhood please donate

1991
01:58:01,472 --> 01:58:01,984
Bail fund

Please donate to supplies anything that you can

1993
01:58:06,592 --> 01:58:12,736

Vocabulary

1995
01:58:19,648 --> 01:58:20,416
Alex

1996
01:58:20,928 --> 01:58:21,440
In color
