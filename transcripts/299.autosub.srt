Because I cut the right there

15
00:00:59,904 --> 00:01:05,280
Doing exactly how I would expect them to be doing at this point they're growing large

16
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:09,120
So they're all so mysterious

17
00:01:09,376 --> 00:01:13,728
Red flower that I plant it is growing quite well not powered yet

18
00:01:13,984 --> 00:01:14,496

00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:28,480
Not interested didn't think what I was doing with the light I have no idea

34
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:31,040

45
00:03:18,912 --> 00:03:22,752

There's no energy

82
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:50,815
Beulah a lack of

00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:51,839

How do I brand for myself

90
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:07,711

I cuz he seems to be disappointed that it's not Cruller

172
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:29,759
Declare a national emergency

173
00:10:30,015 --> 00:10:31,295
As commander-in-chief

174
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:34,879

00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:28,639
Face on Alec

194
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:32,735
Express

195
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:34,527
It really goes to show how little his

196
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:36,319
310 principles that really matter to

197
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:39,391
His fears of an overpowered executive or images of

198
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:41,183
Release date we're always just

199
00:11:41,439 --> 00:11:43,487
You never really meant a word of it

200
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:44,767
Just tell by

201
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:45,791
The way you sweat

202
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:48,863
Around

203
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:54,495
However it would I find particularly upsetting about this clip is it Alex's evoking Eisenhower's deportations

204
00:11:54,751 --> 00:11:55,519
Cuz if they were a good thing

205
00:11:56,543 --> 00:11:59,103
Alex's referring to what's known as operation wet back

206
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:01,151
Which to put it simply was not a good

207
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:09,855
That's why we owe used all the time

208
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:12,671
Actually probably article

209
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:16,255
Operational not simply the enforcement of immigration

210
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:18,303
Beer against

211
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:20,607
Its goal was to draw line

212
00:12:20,863 --> 00:12:22,911
Between who was and who was not American

213
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:30,079
54 which was just on the heels of the 1952 immigration and nationality Act

214
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:32,383
Also known as the McCarran Walter Act

215
00:12:32,895 --> 00:12:35,199
Import named after senator Pat McCarran

216
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:35,967
Who won

217
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:36,735
Protect our country

218
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:39,295
From communism and quote to Jewish interest

219
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:41,087
Which ones

220
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:42,879
Not sure exactly

221
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:45,695
Would you believe he didn't spend it but

222
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:54,655
Much interest in there is a vibe

223
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:58,751
The bill passed both houses of Congress but was president

224
00:12:59,007 --> 00:12:59,519
Truman

225
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:01,567
The veto was overturned by Congress and the bill was

226
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:08,223
What the bill were not good byproduct of abolishing the part of the 70

227
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:09,759
Naturalization Act

228
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:11,295
Specified that only quote

229
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:12,575
Free white person

230
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:14,111
Good become naturalized

231
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:16,415
That's opening the door to non-white in the

232
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:17,183
Citizens

233
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:19,999
This created the need for a new way to exclude people

234
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:21,279
People and the way that happened

235
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:24,095
Was a new mentality that operations like the one in

236
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:25,375
54

237
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:29,727
Namely that non-white immigrants were probably cheating and not you're legally

238
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:33,055
Isn't it ridiculous that single

239
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:36,383
Moments there is a lack of exclusion

240
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:39,711
Everybody's like sleepy

241
00:13:39,967 --> 00:13:46,111
Racism towards the vacuum

242
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:47,647
They're already writing

243
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:48,671
Tooxclusive

244
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:58,655
Illegal until proven otherwise

245
00:13:59,167 --> 00:14:01,983
And operation wet back when a long way toward solidifying

246
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:03,007
Mentality

247
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:09,407
Everybody loved it which is why we use that word all the time I believe it's the Washington again

248
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:14,783
The farms and factories

249
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:16,063
Suzy azzam

250
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:17,599
Support for

251
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:19,135
Professionalism

252
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:21,439
Meanwhile the reality was quite different

253
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:23,999
Repeating had their head shaved

254
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:25,535
For identification purposes

255
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:26,559
Added one in

256
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:27,583
Code 88

257
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:30,399
Detainees died of exposure in the

258
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:31,167
12 degrees

259
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:33,215
Just passed the California border

260
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:43,199
Many detainees weren't given the opportunity to gather their belongings often without

261
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:43,967
Due process

262
00:14:46,783 --> 00:14:48,063
There is a

263
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:52,671
Customer support is Justified their actions by

264
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:53,951
To secure the southern border

265
00:14:54,207 --> 00:14:54,719
Enticed

266
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:55,999
Fears of an invasion

267
00:14:57,791 --> 00:15:00,351
What was the goal or not this operation

268
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:02,399
The appearance of criminality

269
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:03,423
To just be

270
00:15:03,679 --> 00:15:04,703
Being an immigrant from Latin

271
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:06,495
In America

272
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:07,519
Alex is excited

273
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:08,799
We're bored here

274
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:09,823
Not me imagine

275
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:11,103
Solution to his imagine

276
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:12,127
Immigration

277
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:15,199
So does make sense

278
00:15:15,967 --> 00:15:16,991
Pics of Eisenhower's action

279
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:17,759
Composite

280
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:20,319
This late article was written in 20

281
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:23,391
Pretty prescient

282
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:25,695
If the mass deportation

283
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:27,231
Beginning Trump is product

284
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:30,303
Ship of Latinos will always be questioned

285
00:15:30,815 --> 00:15:33,375
Latinos along with people who look Latino Toulon Forest

286
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:34,655
Mike will be forced to produce their

287
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:36,447
Documents

288
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:38,495
To avoid deportation

289
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:40,799
Delivering a poisonous atmosphere

290
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:42,847
Suspicion

291
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:45,663
Enforcement and other law enforcement will inevitably make

292
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:46,431
Tragic mistake

293
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:47,967
Children will not be

294
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:52,575
On Monday child died while being held in custody by immigration authorities

295
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:55,391
He was the fifth child to die in such circumstances

296
00:15:56,927 --> 00:15:57,439
So I think

297
00:15:57,695 --> 00:15:58,207
Prediction

298
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:00,767
Accurate

299
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:01,535
Alex

300
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:02,303
Hearkening

301
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:03,327
To the Legacy

302
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:05,375
Power to jump

303
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:06,399
What do you want to try

304
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:08,959
He's a really f***** up thing

305
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:12,031
If it's not

306
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:12,799
Somehow

307
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:18,175
Horrific act of violence against an entire people

308
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:19,199
Is the

309
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:21,503
Well the good news is that

310
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:24,319
Inevitably

311
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:26,367
Play war with Iran or Venezuela

312
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:32,255
Absolutely have learned our lesson from WWII in Venezuela

313
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:35,071
F****** camps that would be crazy

314
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:40,959
Tell me we would never go back to

315
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:42,495
I don't know because

316
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:47,359
Alex talks about what to do

317
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:48,895
It's a bad sign

318
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:54,015
What an incredible

319
00:16:54,271 --> 00:16:55,807
Alive

320
00:16:59,135 --> 00:17:01,183
Publications like the recall

321
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:01,951
Whoops

322
00:17:03,231 --> 00:17:04,767
That I reporters inside

323
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:11,167
And the president has floated the idea and it says he's getting ready to do it

324
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:13,983
President Trump Insurrection Act

325
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:27,551
A really good

326
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:29,343
Chin of his National Emergency

327
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:31,647
B******* you know imagine

328
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:35,999
Giving Trump this King like power

329
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:37,791
In the Insurrection Act

330
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:42,399
I don't like I don't like to hear this sort of

331
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:44,703
Sting

332
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:51,615
Is really thinking about using the Insurrection Act of course somebody else is right

333
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:52,639
It's almost

334
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:53,663
Useless

335
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:57,759
Speculate about whether or not this is based on a real

336
00:17:58,015 --> 00:17:58,527
Gossip

337
00:17:59,039 --> 00:17:59,807
From the kingdom

338
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:01,855
The palace

339
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:05,951
But I don't like to hear Alex

340
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:06,719
Excited about it

341
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:09,535
Cuz

342
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:12,351
Misconception

343
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:13,887
The Immigrant

344
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:16,191
The refugees and the people who are

345
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:18,751
Them and support

346
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:20,287
Immigration

347
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:23,615
People who are in open Rebellion against

348
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:24,639
Country

349
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:25,407
In Alex

350
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:27,455
His conception of the insurrection

351
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:30,271
National bird

352
00:18:30,783 --> 00:18:31,295
You literally

353
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:34,367
Enacted martial law to put down this Rebellion

354
00:18:34,623 --> 00:18:39,743
Alex is saying

355
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:46,655
You think doesn't seem like his use my multiple movies about martial law

356
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:50,495
Primary brand

357
00:18:50,751 --> 00:18:55,103
Mr. Anti martial law

358
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:58,943
I f****** love that this executive is going to use the Insurrection Act

359
00:18:59,199 --> 00:19:02,015
Barcelo is f****** weird

360
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:04,063
Yeah it's not but it is

361
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:07,903
It's not when you understand Alex Moore.

362
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:11,999
Really f***** up

363
00:19:12,255 --> 00:19:13,791
Borlette

364
00:19:14,047 --> 00:19:15,583
But I think that Alex understands that

365
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:17,887
But it's f***** up counter

366
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:19,423
To everything

367
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:21,471
But he's warned people about

368
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:23,263
For his entire career

369
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:24,543
And so he tries to

370
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:26,847
Explain why this martial law isn't

371
00:19:27,103 --> 00:19:28,127
Bad martial law

372
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:29,919
And I think you can tell just

373
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:30,687
From this clip

374
00:19:30,943 --> 00:19:31,967
Reconcile

375
00:19:32,223 --> 00:19:32,991
What he's doing

376
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:35,039
Spurtle martial law

377
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:37,087
I made four films on martial law

378
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:40,927
Because Bill Clinton and others were planning martial law to take our gun

379
00:19:41,183 --> 00:19:43,999
Using people

380
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:47,071
Is

381
00:19:47,327 --> 00:19:49,375
Emergency martial law

382
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:51,423
To counter the emergency

383
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:55,263
Emergency

384
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:01,151
Define race war

385
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:03,199
Martial law Nationwide

386
00:20:03,455 --> 00:20:08,831
Fake antifa Soros documents contract in order to

387
00:20:09,087 --> 00:20:11,135
To justify and reinforce this

388
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:17,535
It's exactly what you're saying Revolution

389
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:25,727
Tempted

390
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:27,263
Never cruelty

391
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:29,823
Justifying SBA

392
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:33,919
Yeah

393
00:20:34,175 --> 00:20:40,319
We can't because you made us

394
00:20:40,575 --> 00:20:43,135
What you want to do to lock

395
00:20:43,647 --> 00:20:44,159
People up

396
00:20:44,415 --> 00:20:47,231
These immigrants and refugees you want to send them back

397
00:20:47,487 --> 00:20:47,999
To there

398
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:49,023
Probable death

399
00:20:49,535 --> 00:20:51,071
You want

400
00:20:54,655 --> 00:20:58,239
Dental service with no rights whatsoever in fear

401
00:20:58,751 --> 00:21:00,543
For their lives if they

402
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:01,311
Trying

403
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:02,847
Stand up for themselves

404
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:04,639
I'm sort of better working conditions

405
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:05,663
That's what you want

406
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:07,967
Assistant that you wish to see and play

407
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:10,527
Don't hide behind imagine

408
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:13,343
Revolution that you're the counter-revolution

409
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:15,391
It's it's pathetic

410
00:21:15,647 --> 00:21:17,696
I almost see this as like

411
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:25,120
Years or whatever he's been saying that the government is going to cost FEMA camps in all this stuff

412
00:21:25,376 --> 00:21:25,888
President

413
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:30,240
And all of that stuff and none of them

414
00:21:31,008 --> 00:21:31,776
So

415
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:35,616
He's supporting the guy who will do it

416
00:21:35,872 --> 00:21:37,920
In order to prove it

417
00:21:38,176 --> 00:21:40,480
Man that's an interesting way to look at it

418
00:21:40,736 --> 00:21:43,040
Retconning

419
00:21:43,296 --> 00:21:46,880
Narrative

420
00:21:47,136 --> 00:21:53,280
My prophecies have gone unfulfilled and now I must make my prophecies come through or else

421
00:21:53,536 --> 00:21:54,304
Legacy movie

422
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:58,400
That's an interesting way to look at it I don't know if that

423
00:21:58,912 --> 00:22:05,056
School job literary criticism

424
00:22:06,336 --> 00:22:09,152
I think it's more than that

425
00:22:09,408 --> 00:22:10,944
We talked about it a hundred times

426
00:22:13,248 --> 00:22:16,064
There has always been

427
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:22,208
Write the movies about martial law aren't about martial law there about something being done to wipe

428
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:25,536
He feels his team is safe

429
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:30,144
Everything was conditional

430
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:30,912
Very queer

431
00:22:31,168 --> 00:22:32,448
Albany

432
00:22:32,704 --> 00:22:35,520
Literally talking about martial law

433
00:22:35,776 --> 00:22:37,312
And he's talking about it

434
00:22:38,592 --> 00:22:41,920
Watches old f****** movies about martial law

435
00:22:42,176 --> 00:22:45,760
If you imagine him saying something like this

436
00:22:46,784 --> 00:22:49,088
The first emergency was just going to Congressional

437
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:55,232
Oversee DeShields funding and

438
00:22:55,488 --> 00:22:56,256
Law enforcement

439
00:22:56,512 --> 00:22:58,048
Emergency

440
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:00,096
Martial law

441
00:23:06,752 --> 00:23:07,520
Call the jungle

442
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,688
Martial law

443
00:23:14,944 --> 00:23:16,480
Marshal meaning military

444
00:23:18,784 --> 00:23:20,576
Okay so I'm excited again

445
00:23:21,344 --> 00:23:25,440
Ambrosia

446
00:23:27,232 --> 00:23:33,120
Your Town's going to be put under the emergency by the governor a form of Martial law stop loading for a week

447
00:23:33,632 --> 00:23:39,776
Border has not the only reason but also I think we could probably come up with

448
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:46,176
Examples of natural disasters where there has been a inklings of martial law

449
00:23:53,088 --> 00:23:53,600
Agency

450
00:23:53,856 --> 00:23:56,928
Different kind of martial law

451
00:23:59,744 --> 00:24:01,280
Of which there are apparently

452
00:24:03,072 --> 00:24:05,632
That's because of an emergency that wasn't man made

453
00:24:16,384 --> 00:24:17,920
You're the one who broke the Border

454
00:24:20,736 --> 00:24:21,760
You did this

455
00:24:22,272 --> 00:24:23,040
You made me do this

456
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:26,624
The stereotypical

457
00:24:29,952 --> 00:24:31,744
It's gross this is for your own good

458
00:24:32,256 --> 00:24:37,888
Against your will but it's for everybody else

459
00:24:45,056 --> 00:24:48,640
View of the world that he's lied about and created with his rhetoric

460
00:24:48,896 --> 00:24:52,992
In order to justify the idea

461
00:24:53,248 --> 00:24:57,856
If you believe

462
00:24:58,112 --> 00:25:00,672
The rhetoric in the world

463
00:25:03,488 --> 00:25:04,768
For his listeners

464
00:25:05,024 --> 00:25:05,792
It's not real

465
00:25:06,048 --> 00:25:11,936
Compared to the real world people are helping each other

466
00:25:12,192 --> 00:25:14,752
Not going crazy and burning everything

467
00:25:15,008 --> 00:25:16,032
What happens in a creek

468
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:20,128
WhatsApp in 3 days people will

469
00:25:20,384 --> 00:25:20,896
Eat themselves in

470
00:25:21,664 --> 00:25:22,432
That's not my bad

471
00:25:27,552 --> 00:25:28,832
I don't know

472
00:25:29,344 --> 00:25:31,904
My bad news is

473
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:34,464
Reviews episodes

474
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:40,608
Do I'll know in Alex's show

475
00:25:41,376 --> 00:25:46,496
Milkshakes do come up once but I don't have a clip of it but Nigel farage as we know is running

476
00:25:46,752 --> 00:25:52,896
UCare part he's really being investigated

477
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:54,944
Is clearly illegal and corrupt

478
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:55,712
Surprise

479
00:25:56,224 --> 00:26:02,368
I don't know enough about that too, but it's not going to come out

480
00:26:02,624 --> 00:26:04,160
Nigel farage is the word

481
00:26:04,416 --> 00:26:05,184
He's a piece of s***

482
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,208
He's not going to be

483
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:10,048
European

484
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:14,400
And that is tommyrot

485
00:26:17,984 --> 00:26:19,776
He's a piece of s*** he's a disaster

486
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:20,800
He is running

487
00:26:21,056 --> 00:26:21,824
For the northwest

488
00:26:23,872 --> 00:26:25,920
You know the European Parliament

489
00:26:26,176 --> 00:26:26,688
And

490
00:26:26,944 --> 00:26:28,736
He's on Alex's Show 2

491
00:26:28,992 --> 00:26:29,504
To discuss his

492
00:26:30,016 --> 00:26:30,528
Champagne

493
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,344
Man it's just a

494
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:37,952
Trap it's just a it's a PR trap yes that's all

495
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:40,256
Talk more about it on the 20

496
00:26:40,512 --> 00:26:41,024
Recovering

497
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,816
But you're on the 7th

498
00:26:43,584 --> 00:26:44,608
He comes on as a guest

499
00:26:45,888 --> 00:26:46,400
I think that

500
00:26:46,656 --> 00:26:48,192
If you listen to the way he describes

501
00:26:48,448 --> 00:26:49,472
Political campaign

502
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,776
Kind of understand what he's doing

503
00:26:52,288 --> 00:26:54,080
Diamond select toys

504
00:26:59,968 --> 00:27:02,016
Out of the northwest

505
00:27:02,272 --> 00:27:05,344
And I'm trying to tell

506
00:27:07,136 --> 00:27:07,904
Till we get

507
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:10,208
All communities in Austell

508
00:27:10,464 --> 00:27:11,744
Background

509
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,304
Our backgrounds

510
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:24,032
Free speech

511
00:27:24,288 --> 00:27:30,432
Tommy Robinson's primary brand much like Alex's used to be anti martial law

512
00:27:30,688 --> 00:27:32,736
Is a Muslim agitation

513
00:27:36,576 --> 00:27:42,720
Get people out to vote is a noble intention in terms of a representative democracy and a republic

514
00:27:42,976 --> 00:27:44,000
You do want higher

515
00:27:44,256 --> 00:27:45,536
Numbers of people going to

516
00:27:46,816 --> 00:27:48,608
Hiding behind the pretensive

517
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:53,984
Forward

518
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:54,752
Forward

519
00:27:55,264 --> 00:27:56,288
Our backgrounds

520
00:27:56,544 --> 00:27:57,568
Our daughter

521
00:27:57,824 --> 00:28:02,432
You need to hear and then you know OU ragip

522
00:28:02,688 --> 00:28:07,040
The moment you have that appeal to look at what they're doing to our daughters like you

523
00:28:08,064 --> 00:28:11,392
Robinson is this

524
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:14,464
The system it's mobile

525
00:28:16,768 --> 00:28:17,536
You can't see it without

526
00:28:17,792 --> 00:28:18,304
The contact

527
00:28:19,328 --> 00:28:19,840
But

528
00:28:20,096 --> 00:28:20,864
I don't

529
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,144
Care much

530
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,680
Because he doesn't have a snowball's

531
00:28:24,192 --> 00:28:25,216
Some hell of

532
00:28:25,472 --> 00:28:26,240
Selection

533
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:27,008
I don't think

534
00:28:27,776 --> 00:28:28,288
Season

535
00:28:28,544 --> 00:28:29,056
Absurdity

536
00:28:29,312 --> 00:28:30,080
And awful

537
00:28:30,336 --> 00:28:31,104
Shuffle playlist

538
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,896
But what

539
00:28:34,176 --> 00:28:34,688
Is

540
00:28:36,992 --> 00:28:38,528
Sort of logical conclusion of the

541
00:28:42,368 --> 00:28:43,648
Payment processors

542
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:48,256
That not want to work with him he's been kicked off all the social media Networks

543
00:28:50,816 --> 00:28:52,096
Best political campaign

544
00:28:52,608 --> 00:28:53,888
I think he's doing it

545
00:28:54,144 --> 00:28:54,912
Specifically

546
00:28:55,424 --> 00:28:56,192
Keep agitating

547
00:28:56,448 --> 00:28:56,960
Against

548
00:28:57,472 --> 00:28:58,496
And doing things

549
00:28:58,752 --> 00:28:59,264
Does

550
00:29:01,312 --> 00:29:02,848
But now be able to be like

551
00:29:03,104 --> 00:29:06,944
You guys not letting me on is disrupting the political process

552
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:11,296
So what you're saying is he's trying to do because

553
00:29:11,808 --> 00:29:13,856
By running for a political office

554
00:29:14,112 --> 00:29:17,184
He forces the mainstream press to cover his bulge

555
00:29:17,696 --> 00:29:18,976
Or at least admit it's an attempt

556
00:29:19,232 --> 00:29:20,256
X2

557
00:29:20,512 --> 00:29:22,304
To make the argument that these processors

558
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:23,328
Are not allowed

559
00:29:24,864 --> 00:29:26,144
Donation

560
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:29,984
And turn it into some issues its much larger than it is when it really

561
00:29:31,776 --> 00:29:33,824
Crusade against Islam

562
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:34,848
Is personal

563
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,920
About

564
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:38,688
Being

565
00:29:39,456 --> 00:29:39,968
Forced

566
00:29:40,224 --> 00:29:41,504
On to everybody

567
00:29:42,016 --> 00:29:42,784
Yeah

568
00:29:43,808 --> 00:29:44,320
It's a mess

569
00:29:44,576 --> 00:29:45,344
And we'll get

570
00:29:48,672 --> 00:29:50,720
On it when we talk about the 20th

571
00:29:50,976 --> 00:29:52,768
But for now he's just on the show he's like

572
00:29:54,816 --> 00:30:00,192
Help help help me out I need anything out anywhere

573
00:30:00,448 --> 00:30:01,984
Cuz everybody knows I'm a dick

574
00:30:03,776 --> 00:30:05,056
I am so that's all we're

575
00:30:07,104 --> 00:30:08,128
Alex gets back in

576
00:30:08,384 --> 00:30:09,664
Into his own bulshit

577
00:30:10,176 --> 00:30:11,712
Talking about martial law

578
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:14,272
Making it

579
00:30:14,528 --> 00:30:15,296
Pretty clear

580
00:30:15,808 --> 00:30:16,576
Vets

581
00:30:17,344 --> 00:30:18,880
He thinks that his audiences are sources

582
00:30:19,392 --> 00:30:20,416
Intelligent

583
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,304
45 minutes

584
00:30:27,072 --> 00:30:28,352
Quickly

585
00:30:28,608 --> 00:30:30,400
Call Zack

586
00:30:35,008 --> 00:30:37,312
Did you want

587
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:48,320
Focus Martial law

588
00:30:48,576 --> 00:30:50,368
We're already under Anarchy way

589
00:30:51,392 --> 00:30:54,720
So like a couple couple weeks

590
00:30:54,976 --> 00:30:58,304
Trump made me turn on Trump

591
00:30:59,072 --> 00:31:00,096
All over the f******

592
00:31:00,352 --> 00:31:03,936
Play It's So conditional it's so day today

593
00:31:04,192 --> 00:31:04,704
Anybody who

594
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:05,728
Tens that likes

595
00:31:05,984 --> 00:31:09,824
I've read hundreds of books and that's what I'm basing my assessment of the globalist

596
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,872
My lifelong Crusade against them

597
00:31:12,128 --> 00:31:17,760
Anybody who tries to pretend to have that rock-solid of a foundation about what they're doing

598
00:31:18,272 --> 00:31:20,320
I can't imagine how embarrassing it would be for them

599
00:31:20,576 --> 00:31:22,624
To know that they're recording themselves

600
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,672
Constantly contradicting themselves

601
00:31:24,928 --> 00:31:28,512
I disagree

602
00:31:28,768 --> 00:31:30,048
Short-term stocks Trader

603
00:31:30,304 --> 00:31:36,448
Every time the market goes up

604
00:31:40,288 --> 00:31:44,896
He's Chasin whatever High short-term news

605
00:31:45,152 --> 00:31:46,688
And whether it's Pro or anti

606
00:31:46,944 --> 00:31:47,456
Even his hero

607
00:31:47,712 --> 00:31:48,736
Right

608
00:31:48,992 --> 00:31:50,784
It's a sickle

609
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:57,184
A legitimate support

610
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:59,232
20 year-long mental degradation

611
00:31:59,744 --> 00:32:02,048
As his attention

612
00:32:02,304 --> 00:32:05,632
Has gradually dwindled

613
00:32:07,936 --> 00:32:13,568
He's unable to remember the 10 seconds

614
00:32:13,824 --> 00:32:16,128
It's I think it's also a manifestation of like

615
00:32:16,384 --> 00:32:18,432
What we talked about

616
00:32:22,528 --> 00:32:24,320
So he doesn't even remember it

617
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:30,720
I hope for his own sake I hope he doesn't

618
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:34,560
Yeah for sure

619
00:32:36,096 --> 00:32:37,120
How much like

620
00:32:37,888 --> 00:32:39,168
This show

621
00:32:39,936 --> 00:32:40,448
Send it

622
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:41,472
Psychiatry

623
00:32:41,984 --> 00:32:42,752
Sleeping breathing

624
00:32:43,008 --> 00:32:45,056
Studying

625
00:32:45,568 --> 00:32:46,592
Researching is narrative

626
00:32:47,104 --> 00:32:47,616
And I hate it

627
00:32:48,128 --> 00:32:48,640
The worst

628
00:32:48,896 --> 00:32:50,176
Firmly convinced

629
00:32:50,432 --> 00:32:51,968
That I know he's a liar

630
00:32:52,224 --> 00:32:53,504
I know that he doesn't know what he's talking

631
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,552
I'm about I can't imagine

632
00:32:56,064 --> 00:32:57,088
What it would feel like

633
00:32:57,344 --> 00:32:59,648
In 20 years if we keep doing the show that long

634
00:32:59,904 --> 00:33:00,672
To be like

635
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:11,168
I can imagine the show for 2 years

636
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:12,704
Believing the opposite

637
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,496
Continuing to believe the opposite

638
00:33:15,008 --> 00:33:19,104
So or supporting someone who is going to bring

639
00:33:20,896 --> 00:33:24,992
Yeah and then you everyday you wake up with a the burning

640
00:33:25,248 --> 00:33:26,272
Tell Tale Heart

641
00:33:26,528 --> 00:33:28,064
Maybe breaking beneath your floor

642
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:28,832
If you feel

643
00:33:37,792 --> 00:33:41,632
And we're the only punishment

644
00:33:45,216 --> 00:33:49,824
On top of that

645
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:51,616
Ancestral memory

646
00:33:56,224 --> 00:33:58,272
Kind of bad from our position

647
00:33:58,528 --> 00:33:59,296
In terms of his ID

648
00:33:59,552 --> 00:34:00,576
Videos about martial law

649
00:34:01,088 --> 00:34:03,648
And I will say even after the clip they won't

650
00:34:03,904 --> 00:34:04,672
Look good

651
00:34:04,928 --> 00:34:05,440
But

652
00:34:05,696 --> 00:34:06,208
You tries to

653
00:34:06,464 --> 00:34:07,488
Explain the difference

654
00:34:08,256 --> 00:34:09,024
The martial law

655
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:09,792
Fart again

656
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:11,328
Martial law

657
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:16,192
Encouraging beyond our expectations

658
00:34:16,448 --> 00:34:17,728
Try

659
00:34:20,544 --> 00:34:21,568
Dissociate with failure

660
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:25,152
It's associated with ism

661
00:34:25,408 --> 00:34:30,784
Could The clintons Wanted at that martial law

662
00:34:41,792 --> 00:34:44,864
The same martial law

663
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:46,656
Border

664
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:51,264
Federal judges

665
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:52,544
That would be the same way

666
00:34:55,872 --> 00:34:58,176
A hundred thousand a month for across

667
00:35:00,736 --> 00:35:02,272
Clark's child trafficking

668
00:35:07,392 --> 00:35:07,904
And I

669
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:10,464
Politically use the term martial law

670
00:35:13,024 --> 00:35:14,560
This is a form of martial law

671
00:35:17,376 --> 00:35:19,424
It's just marshall law means

672
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:21,728
Abnormal

673
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:24,288
Your wall because it's failed

674
00:35:24,544 --> 00:35:25,056
Not what it means

675
00:35:25,312 --> 00:35:27,104
Because the government collapsed

676
00:35:27,616 --> 00:35:28,128
Nope

677
00:35:28,896 --> 00:35:31,712
Martial law meaning Marshall

678
00:35:31,968 --> 00:35:33,504
The Marshal of the band

679
00:35:35,552 --> 00:35:36,576
The Marshal of the band

680
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:39,392
It's not

681
00:35:40,416 --> 00:35:41,184
Troubling

682
00:35:42,464 --> 00:35:44,256
Equivocate

683
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:46,048
Do you know

684
00:35:47,584 --> 00:35:48,608
A shocking

685
00:35:53,984 --> 00:35:55,264
It's hard to differentiate

686
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:56,288
When I say shocking

687
00:35:56,544 --> 00:36:01,408
Figured like I'm not shocked to hear Alex

688
00:36:06,528 --> 00:36:07,296
Expressing

689
00:36:08,832 --> 00:36:10,624
Martial law for gun can

690
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:11,648
Controlled

691
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:13,184
Martial law for f

692
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:13,952
Cleansing

693
00:36:14,208 --> 00:36:20,352
Good exactly what you said there is it's a form of Martial law and the form of Martial law is weird

694
00:36:20,608 --> 00:36:26,496
Marshalls

695
00:36:28,544 --> 00:36:32,640
Seems that way

696
00:36:32,896 --> 00:36:35,712
For it to be something that's

697
00:36:36,224 --> 00:36:36,992
Is just a

698
00:36:37,248 --> 00:36:37,760
Terrifying

699
00:36:38,016 --> 00:36:39,296
Look at someone who's

700
00:36:40,064 --> 00:36:40,576
Cruel

701
00:36:40,832 --> 00:36:42,368
Don't mind hurting people

702
00:36:43,392 --> 00:36:46,976
It's awful awful

703
00:36:47,488 --> 00:36:48,000
Space is just

704
00:36:48,768 --> 00:36:49,280
Is it terrifying

705
00:36:49,536 --> 00:36:50,304
Glimpse

706
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:51,328
How people can

707
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:56,960
Each other really would have hated being

708
00:36:58,752 --> 00:37:02,848
Are like he really loved being a dictator but he would have hated living underneath a dick

709
00:37:09,504 --> 00:37:11,296
Most dictators do not want to be

710
00:37:16,928 --> 00:37:17,952
It's almost right

711
00:37:18,208 --> 00:37:18,720
To even

712
00:37:19,232 --> 00:37:19,744
Talk about

713
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:20,512
But it's

714
00:37:22,048 --> 00:37:23,072
Necessary to look at

715
00:37:24,864 --> 00:37:27,168
This is Alex now

716
00:37:27,424 --> 00:37:30,496
Hey Patriots come get your boy

717
00:37:30,752 --> 00:37:33,568
He's wildin out over here talk about martial law

718
00:37:33,824 --> 00:37:34,848
He is off

719
00:37:36,896 --> 00:37:38,688
Lost it

720
00:37:38,944 --> 00:37:39,456
Yes

721
00:37:42,528 --> 00:37:46,624
Tarpley article that you wrote back in

722
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,672
16 warning about the idea

723
00:37:48,928 --> 00:37:49,440
The

724
00:37:49,696 --> 00:37:50,208
The

725
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:52,768
Superficiality and the emptiness

726
00:37:53,024 --> 00:37:54,304
Libertarianism

727
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:57,632
In terms of the Ron Paul movement

728
00:37:57,888 --> 00:37:59,168
Edsby

729
00:37:59,424 --> 00:38:00,960
The Buell wherein we will all be led to

730
00:38:01,216 --> 00:38:01,728
The fascism

731
00:38:01,984 --> 00:38:02,752
Authoritarian

732
00:38:03,264 --> 00:38:08,896
So mad at Tarpley for making a good point it's fascinating that insight

733
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:10,432
And how

734
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:11,968
It really does track

735
00:38:12,992 --> 00:38:18,624
Maybe not the entire world and certainly not necessarily all people who have lived

736
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:19,392
Quotations

737
00:38:19,648 --> 00:38:21,184
But f****** Alex it is

738
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:22,976
On the head

739
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:24,768
Hit met mail

740
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:26,048
So

741
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:26,816
I don't know

742
00:38:27,072 --> 00:38:27,584
Alex's

743
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:28,608
Makes me sad

744
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:32,960
What's interesting to

745
00:38:33,216 --> 00:38:33,728
Expected

746
00:38:33,984 --> 00:38:35,776
You hear a lot more about these abortion pills

747
00:38:36,032 --> 00:38:42,176
Jack doesn't come up

748
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:46,528
Does it come up

749
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:48,064
To say that they're protecting

750
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:54,464
Children

751
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:58,560
Like you got to give it up to the Somali pirates

752
00:38:58,816 --> 00:39:01,888
Couple episodes that I didn't listen to

753
00:39:02,144 --> 00:39:04,448
Not a f****** mention of it except for

754
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:05,472
Dismissive

755
00:39:05,728 --> 00:39:06,752
8 bills are great

756
00:39:07,008 --> 00:39:08,032
Protecting children

757
00:39:08,288 --> 00:39:08,800
Cherish

758
00:39:09,312 --> 00:39:10,592
Analysis

759
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:12,128
Yeah I like it but

760
00:39:12,384 --> 00:39:13,920
That doesn't mean that he doesn't

761
00:39:14,176 --> 00:39:14,944
Some of my old favorite

762
00:39:15,456 --> 00:39:17,248
Like lying about Ellis Island

763
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:26,976
On average quarantine

764
00:39:27,744 --> 00:39:29,024
No one's being checked

765
00:39:29,536 --> 00:39:30,816
Diseases are pouring in

766
00:39:31,328 --> 00:39:32,608
Can you imagine how

767
00:39:32,864 --> 00:39:33,376
Huge

768
00:39:33,632 --> 00:39:35,168
Ellis Island would have had to have been

769
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:36,704
How cumbersome

770
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:38,752
I help you

771
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:40,544
3 months on average

772
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:41,312
That's

773
00:39:41,568 --> 00:39:45,920
Absurd how many people would come through a day like thousand

774
00:39:46,176 --> 00:39:50,016
The jet backlog

775
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:54,368
For 3 months

776
00:39:54,880 --> 00:40:01,024
Gradually

777
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:06,144
Ridiculous I would be about 30 million people by the end of 90 days

778
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:08,704
I would say

779
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:09,472
Estimate it would

780
00:40:09,728 --> 00:40:12,288
Be larger than the city of Chicago at

781
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:13,824
Are you given time for sure

782
00:40:14,336 --> 00:40:15,616
100-percent

783
00:40:16,384 --> 00:40:18,432
With with a far smaller

784
00:40:18,944 --> 00:40:20,224
It's a laughable

785
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:21,248
Thing for Alex

786
00:40:21,504 --> 00:40:22,784
Text to be trying to prevent that

787
00:40:24,832 --> 00:40:26,880
I know that we talked about Ellis Island probably too much

788
00:40:27,392 --> 00:40:30,208
Impasse episode

789
00:40:30,464 --> 00:40:31,232
To bring it up because it's

790
00:40:31,744 --> 00:40:32,256
This is what

791
00:40:32,512 --> 00:40:33,024
He believes

792
00:40:34,048 --> 00:40:34,816
Used to happen

793
00:40:36,096 --> 00:40:37,888
He's facing a lot of his

794
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,424
Understanding

795
00:40:40,704 --> 00:40:41,472
Recommendation

796
00:40:41,728 --> 00:40:42,752
About immigration

797
00:40:43,008 --> 00:40:44,032
Stuff that never his exact

798
00:40:44,288 --> 00:40:45,056
Listed

799
00:40:45,312 --> 00:40:46,592
I just completed storical revision

800
00:40:49,664 --> 00:40:52,736
Probably I would say more astonishing achievement

801
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:56,320
Ellis Island admission of so many

802
00:40:56,576 --> 00:40:57,088
Immigrants

803
00:40:57,344 --> 00:40:58,624
Sylvia

804
00:40:59,136 --> 00:41:01,696
Was

805
00:41:02,208 --> 00:41:08,352
What America was supposed to be here through the entire world

806
00:41:08,608 --> 00:41:14,752
There's still some cultural and social problems with the history of Ellis Island

807
00:41:15,008 --> 00:41:17,312
From a bureaucratic perspective it's almost

808
00:41:18,336 --> 00:41:19,616
Simply Amazing

809
00:41:19,872 --> 00:41:20,896
That it works

810
00:41:22,176 --> 00:41:24,992
So those calls

811
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:27,808
Put out the call for military

812
00:41:28,064 --> 00:41:30,368
Police people's call in

813
00:41:31,392 --> 00:41:33,952
Actually the military

814
00:41:34,208 --> 00:41:40,352
You just call it a call and say that you are

815
00:41:40,608 --> 00:41:44,960
Ridiculous

816
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:54,943
I'm willing to stipulate just for the sake of like I don't even want to get into it that they all are

817
00:41:55,199 --> 00:41:59,039
The point out that Alex has no way of knowing

818
00:41:59,295 --> 00:42:00,575
If they are or are not

819
00:42:00,831 --> 00:42:01,599
So we're going to take

820
00:42:01,855 --> 00:42:04,159
The least likely scenario

821
00:42:04,415 --> 00:42:06,207
That all of you

822
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:09,791
Just because who cares because if

823
00:42:10,047 --> 00:42:10,559
They're not

824
00:42:10,815 --> 00:42:14,911
This next call is really f***** up where caller tells Alex he's arrested

825
00:42:15,167 --> 00:42:21,311
A couple of undocumented immigrant

826
00:42:27,967 --> 00:42:28,991
Anyway here's this caller

827
00:42:29,503 --> 00:42:35,391
Big listener regular collar for shiitake products and action else I won't waste anymore of your time served

828
00:42:36,415 --> 00:42:38,463
In the last week I'm in North Texas

829
00:42:38,719 --> 00:42:42,559
I have a I have arrested three illegals myself

830
00:42:43,327 --> 00:42:46,655
Metric Hunter panel as well as other things on them

831
00:42:47,167 --> 00:42:48,447
I'm nowhere near the border

832
00:42:48,959 --> 00:42:51,263
Uncle to the Oklahoman I am Mexico

833
00:42:52,287 --> 00:42:55,103
I have invaded us on every level as

834
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:56,127
Well-known

835
00:42:56,639 --> 00:42:59,967
Their influence from MS-13 to the Vista

836
00:43:00,223 --> 00:43:00,991
Drug pushers

837
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:05,599
Everything else have gotten everywhere and

838
00:43:06,111 --> 00:43:08,671
Trump must shut this place down now

839
00:43:09,951 --> 00:43:11,999
On an emergency and it must be done

840
00:43:12,255 --> 00:43:13,279
I'm telling you Alex

841
00:43:13,535 --> 00:43:16,863
So I just play that clip to illustrate the kind of

842
00:43:17,119 --> 00:43:18,143
Consensus opinion of the

843
00:43:18,655 --> 00:43:19,167
You're calling it today

844
00:43:21,983 --> 00:43:23,263
People are still listening

845
00:43:23,775 --> 00:43:24,799
So

846
00:43:25,055 --> 00:43:28,895
With a grain of salt that it may not represent that large

847
00:43:31,199 --> 00:43:32,735
It's what it's what Alex is audien

848
00:43:33,503 --> 00:43:34,783
Is all on board with

849
00:43:36,575 --> 00:43:37,343
Possibly

850
00:43:37,855 --> 00:43:38,879
Identical lamorak

851
00:43:39,647 --> 00:43:40,159
Take on it

852
00:43:41,183 --> 00:43:42,719
That's not good specially

853
00:43:43,231 --> 00:43:44,511
Not if those are people who are

854
00:43:45,791 --> 00:43:48,351
Yeah that's usually a bad sign for civil rights

855
00:43:48,863 --> 00:43:50,911
In general

856
00:43:51,423 --> 00:43:53,215
It's almost a worst sign if they like 24

857
00:43:55,775 --> 00:44:01,407
What all those border militias aren't really held in check by

858
00:44:02,175 --> 00:44:06,783
Like basically allowed to get away scot-free and they even look at them as allies more often

859
00:44:08,831 --> 00:44:12,927
Running around

860
00:44:20,607 --> 00:44:22,143
Does being a bad looks at the future

861
00:44:24,191 --> 00:44:24,703
Alex

862
00:44:25,215 --> 00:44:26,239
Is it between calls

863
00:44:26,751 --> 00:44:27,775
He realizes that like

864
00:44:28,543 --> 00:44:30,079
He needs to let people know that

865
00:44:30,335 --> 00:44:31,103
S*** is getting

866
00:44:31,615 --> 00:44:32,127
Real for him

867
00:44:32,639 --> 00:44:33,919
And he is

868
00:44:34,687 --> 00:44:35,199
Trouble

869
00:44:35,711 --> 00:44:36,479
I don't want it

870
00:44:43,391 --> 00:44:43,903
I don't like

871
00:44:45,695 --> 00:44:48,255
But

872
00:44:50,815 --> 00:44:51,327
But

873
00:44:55,423 --> 00:44:57,983
Inordinate amounts of Time funny operation

874
00:44:58,239 --> 00:45:00,799
10 years ago back

875
00:45:05,919 --> 00:45:07,711
Stupid

876
00:45:08,735 --> 00:45:10,783
Because

877
00:45:14,879 --> 00:45:18,719
Have a helicopter to go cover news

878
00:45:22,815 --> 00:45:24,863
Wish I knew what I knew now when I was young

879
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:30,495
Just just to let all of my listeners

880
00:45:33,823 --> 00:45:34,335
The money is

881
00:45:34,591 --> 00:45:40,735
F*** the radar

882
00:45:40,991 --> 00:45:41,759
People

883
00:45:42,015 --> 00:45:43,039
Into what he was saying

884
00:45:43,295 --> 00:45:47,647
Yeah if you have a reasonably sized radio audience

885
00:45:48,415 --> 00:45:48,927
You can make

886
00:45:49,183 --> 00:45:53,023
Quite a bit of money monetizing that audience

887
00:45:53,279 --> 00:45:57,119
Especially if you're going with these sort of weirdo advertisers that have really nice

888
00:45:57,631 --> 00:45:58,399
Survivalist

889
00:46:00,703 --> 00:46:05,055
You have a market that's very unique

890
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:12,223
CNN's not going to be advertised people who has more

891
00:46:12,479 --> 00:46:12,991
Maine

892
00:46:13,247 --> 00:46:15,551
Incredible

893
00:46:15,807 --> 00:46:20,671
We're only going to advertise for avatar The Last Airbender

894
00:46:23,487 --> 00:46:29,631
Will advertise Jordan 4

895
00:46:29,887 --> 00:46:30,399
Dude

896
00:46:30,655 --> 00:46:33,471
Driver toys for Frank Herbert's estate

897
00:46:40,127 --> 00:46:41,407
Yeah

898
00:46:42,687 --> 00:46:43,199
Express

899
00:46:43,455 --> 00:46:44,223
Is real

900
00:46:44,479 --> 00:46:50,623
Money used to be no big deal

901
00:46:50,879 --> 00:46:51,391
Because I am

902
00:46:51,647 --> 00:46:53,439
Fuk right now is consequences

903
00:46:53,695 --> 00:46:56,767
Of the things that I did when he was flushed

904
00:46:59,583 --> 00:47:03,423
Tell all my listeners there's a story about a grasshopper

905
00:47:08,543 --> 00:47:14,687
And that's how they say

906
00:47:16,991 --> 00:47:17,503
Exaggerating

907
00:47:19,039 --> 00:47:20,063
But he says this

908
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:22,111
A little bit later and

909
00:47:25,695 --> 00:47:26,463
Like

910
00:47:26,719 --> 00:47:27,487
How bad it might

911
00:47:29,279 --> 00:47:31,071
The money

912
00:47:32,095 --> 00:47:35,935
But we've got some shirts

913
00:47:41,311 --> 00:47:42,335
Sports person in Spanish

914
00:47:42,591 --> 00:47:44,383
Lawson

915
00:47:44,639 --> 00:47:47,199
So Alex doesn't have the money to sue the splc

916
00:47:48,991 --> 00:47:50,271
Weekend the proud boys

917
00:47:50,527 --> 00:47:55,391
Conceivably Alex has less money than the sucking

918
00:47:55,647 --> 00:47:56,415
Proud boys

919
00:47:56,671 --> 00:48:02,815
Well I mean okay

920
00:48:03,071 --> 00:48:03,839
Southern Poverty Law

921
00:48:04,607 --> 00:48:06,399
Where is Alex wants to

922
00:48:06,655 --> 00:48:07,423
Punish

923
00:48:07,679 --> 00:48:08,959
The Southern Poverty Law

924
00:48:09,215 --> 00:48:14,335
Center

925
00:48:14,591 --> 00:48:20,735
Not a regular similar place because Alex

926
00:48:20,991 --> 00:48:23,039
Run by Bosch or Banks and globalist

927
00:48:23,295 --> 00:48:25,855
And they've designated him as a hate speech

928
00:48:26,111 --> 00:48:29,951
Crippling is ability to use PayPal or something

929
00:48:30,207 --> 00:48:33,023
So are we just complaints are very similar to those

930
00:48:33,279 --> 00:48:33,791
Proud boys

931
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:39,935
Makes me think that I was may have less money to Gavin McInnes

932
00:48:40,191 --> 00:48:43,775
And I don't think Gavin is saved from his bike bike

933
00:48:45,311 --> 00:48:46,591
Some s*** about Jon Ronson

934
00:48:47,615 --> 00:48:48,127
Really care

935
00:48:49,151 --> 00:48:49,919
Move past that

936
00:48:50,175 --> 00:48:52,223
Cuz it gets to another caller who I think is a little

937
00:48:54,783 --> 00:48:55,807
Okay if I had to guess

938
00:48:57,599 --> 00:48:59,647
Other end

939
00:49:00,671 --> 00:49:02,975
A list of four things that he needs to do

940
00:49:03,743 --> 00:49:04,767
He needs to stop

941
00:49:05,023 --> 00:49:06,047
These chemtrails

942
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:07,583
Get the Air Force

943
00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:09,631
Sons of pitches out of the

944
00:49:09,887 --> 00:49:11,167
I'm sick of it

945
00:49:11,423 --> 00:49:14,239
Everybody sick this is why people are delusional

946
00:49:16,799 --> 00:49:19,103
Well it's true it's true

947
00:49:19,615 --> 00:49:22,943
Reinforcement

948
00:49:23,199 --> 00:49:28,063
Probably don't even know

949
00:49:29,343 --> 00:49:31,903
Goodyear

950
00:49:32,159 --> 00:49:33,183
This is a plan

951
00:49:33,695 --> 00:49:36,511
The president has to take

952
00:49:37,023 --> 00:49:43,167
Complain more about the Border cuz he needed to get off the topic a little bit cuz she just said Shoop Lane

953
00:49:43,423 --> 00:49:49,311
Calling wild-eyed insane person Debbie I hope you enjoy Minnesota

954
00:49:49,567 --> 00:49:53,151
So has been talking about rambling

955
00:49:53,407 --> 00:49:55,711
He's been talking a bit about chemtrails

956
00:49:56,223 --> 00:49:57,247
There's been some coverage

957
00:49:57,503 --> 00:50:01,855
Which leads me to believe that maybe she's a Lionel fan

958
00:50:02,111 --> 00:50:03,391
I don't know

959
00:50:05,695 --> 00:50:07,487
Also those list

960
00:50:07,743 --> 00:50:09,791
I realized

961
00:50:10,303 --> 00:50:13,119
She's representing could be one of the scariest

962
00:50:13,375 --> 00:50:13,887
F****** things

963
00:50:14,143 --> 00:50:15,935
Send the ID in the world

964
00:50:16,447 --> 00:50:16,959
Because

965
00:50:17,215 --> 00:50:19,263
Let's say Trump does want to shoot up

966
00:50:19,519 --> 00:50:20,031
Playing out of the sky

967
00:50:20,543 --> 00:50:26,687
Right Hillary's completely

968
00:50:26,943 --> 00:50:28,223
Medical situation

969
00:50:28,479 --> 00:50:34,623
To throw nuclear warheads around whatever want to shoot

970
00:50:34,879 --> 00:50:39,231
I'm obviously being

971
00:50:39,743 --> 00:50:40,767
It would be in

972
00:50:41,023 --> 00:50:43,583
Circumstance that is far past where we are now

973
00:50:43,839 --> 00:50:46,911
It's a nightmarish scenario where

974
00:50:47,167 --> 00:50:47,679
We are

975
00:50:49,983 --> 00:50:55,615
Tacoma day where he

976
00:50:56,639 --> 00:50:58,175
To use this as a cover

977
00:50:58,431 --> 00:51:04,575
Poisoning your families with their barium salt in the sky

978
00:51:07,647 --> 00:51:09,183
Beat me realize how much these

979
00:51:09,439 --> 00:51:10,207
Conspiracy theories

980
00:51:10,719 --> 00:51:11,999
Incredibly powerful

981
00:51:12,255 --> 00:51:13,535
As a cover tool

982
00:51:17,631 --> 00:51:18,143
Used

983
00:51:19,423 --> 00:51:20,191
An excuse for any

984
00:51:20,703 --> 00:51:21,471
Kind of extra

985
00:51:21,727 --> 00:51:27,871
Judicial killing they wanted to

986
00:51:28,127 --> 00:51:30,175
Empower there's always going to be

987
00:51:30,687 --> 00:51:35,551
Thinly veiled excuse to remove

988
00:51:36,063 --> 00:51:41,695
Your situation I understand that trend

989
00:51:41,951 --> 00:51:43,231
And I guess I just didn't realize

990
00:51:43,487 --> 00:51:46,559
How useful some of the

991
00:51:46,815 --> 00:51:49,887
I think about very often

992
00:51:50,399 --> 00:51:53,215
But hearing her articulated that way baby realized

993
00:51:53,727 --> 00:51:55,007
So many of the prong

994
00:51:55,263 --> 00:51:58,591
Right of the world that Alex has built up could very easily

995
00:51:59,103 --> 00:51:59,871
Be used

996
00:52:00,127 --> 00:52:00,895
To justify

997
00:52:01,407 --> 00:52:02,431
Some really f***** up stuff

998
00:52:02,687 --> 00:52:03,455
Well let me know

999
00:52:03,711 --> 00:52:07,039
Go back to Jason's for any number of

1000
00:52:07,295 --> 00:52:09,855
F****** calling their genocide there whatever you like

1001
00:52:10,111 --> 00:52:10,879
And go deep

1002
00:52:11,135 --> 00:52:16,767
Further down and you find a ridiculous conspiracy theories it doesn't really make any goddamn sense

1003
00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:20,351
A large part of what I'm saying is

1004
00:52:21,375 --> 00:52:24,191
Suck me first

1005
00:52:24,447 --> 00:52:27,519
For having that experience of listening to

1006
00:52:27,775 --> 00:52:28,799
Thought about

1007
00:52:29,055 --> 00:52:30,591
Useful for that

1008
00:52:31,615 --> 00:52:33,663
Alex one more call

1009
00:52:35,711 --> 00:52:38,271
He's in the middle of

1010
00:52:38,527 --> 00:52:39,551
Plug for his product

1011
00:52:40,063 --> 00:52:41,599
And then he goes to the call

1012
00:52:41,855 --> 00:52:42,879
And let's see how that plays

1013
00:52:44,159 --> 00:52:45,951
It should be fun

1014
00:52:46,207 --> 00:52:47,231
Operation

1015
00:52:49,279 --> 00:52:50,815
For your support we couldn't do it without you

1016
00:52:51,071 --> 00:52:53,887
Arizona

1017
00:52:54,655 --> 00:52:56,191
Hello sir

1018
00:52:57,983 --> 00:53:02,079
Forgot what I was going to say if you can keep calling me I just want to plug your products real quick

1019
00:53:02,591 --> 00:53:04,383
The other day I bought six

1020
00:53:04,639 --> 00:53:05,407
T-shirt

1021
00:53:05,663 --> 00:53:08,991
My son is currently wearing the 50 caliber

1022
00:53:09,503 --> 00:53:12,575
1776 coming take a shirt to school today

1023
00:53:12,831 --> 00:53:18,719
Get me some of that D12.

1024
00:53:19,231 --> 00:53:20,767
She forgets what she's even

1025
00:53:21,023 --> 00:53:24,095
Talk about your Vamp by plugging Alex's product

1026
00:53:24,351 --> 00:53:27,167
She's got a well-trained dog or they're fake

1027
00:53:27,423 --> 00:53:30,239
I can't decide which weather

1028
00:53:32,031 --> 00:53:33,567
Sounds to remember

1029
00:53:33,823 --> 00:53:38,687
It sounds too insane plausible that you would have your son

1030
00:53:39,199 --> 00:53:39,711
50

1031
00:53:39,967 --> 00:53:45,087
2 caliber the teacher almost what you would do called

1032
00:53:46,111 --> 00:53:48,927
Reality

1033
00:53:49,439 --> 00:53:54,303
Is blurring debris and when she finally does remember what she's going to talk about it

1034
00:53:54,559 --> 00:53:56,351
Just a bland call about how the border is

1035
00:53:58,143 --> 00:54:00,447
I don't know I don't know

1036
00:54:00,959 --> 00:54:03,775
I don't know about intention but what I do know is

1037
00:54:04,031 --> 00:54:05,567
The fact and ineffective

1038
00:54:06,079 --> 00:54:07,359
What you see is

1039
00:54:07,615 --> 00:54:10,687
Take a call I forgot I was going to say help me plug

1040
00:54:10,943 --> 00:54:11,711
Yeah

1041
00:54:11,967 --> 00:54:13,247
Just a f****** everything

1042
00:54:13,503 --> 00:54:14,783
Is a bad show

1043
00:54:15,039 --> 00:54:18,879
Because if you are a longtime listener Valley

1044
00:54:19,135 --> 00:54:21,695
And you got a hold of Alex on the air

1045
00:54:22,207 --> 00:54:28,351
And you forgot what you were going to say you know to buy yourself time by just plugging in

1046
00:54:29,375 --> 00:54:33,471
Some favors

1047
00:54:34,495 --> 00:54:37,311
Is you have bought that time

1048
00:54:37,823 --> 00:54:38,591
So

1049
00:54:38,847 --> 00:54:40,383
Sunday

1050
00:54:40,895 --> 00:54:41,663
We are Sunday

1051
00:54:41,919 --> 00:54:43,455
No big deal

1052
00:54:43,711 --> 00:54:44,991
About to be fired

1053
00:54:46,015 --> 00:54:47,551
It seemed like a money is good right now

1054
00:54:47,807 --> 00:54:50,111
So we get to Monday

1055
00:54:50,367 --> 00:54:50,879
The 20th

1056
00:54:51,135 --> 00:54:52,415
And I think

1057
00:54:53,695 --> 00:54:54,207
Interesting

1058
00:54:54,975 --> 00:54:55,743
It's not a choice

1059
00:54:56,255 --> 00:54:57,023
But there's a vibe

1060
00:54:57,535 --> 00:54:59,327
That I'm really worried about

1061
00:55:00,607 --> 00:55:01,119
I think

1062
00:55:01,375 --> 00:55:02,655
You should be very worried about this

1063
00:55:04,191 --> 00:55:04,959
Time

1064
00:55:05,215 --> 00:55:05,727
Deceased

1065
00:55:05,983 --> 00:55:07,519
Some signs that it might be a good

1066
00:55:08,543 --> 00:55:09,823
Okay

1067
00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:10,591
Okay

1068
00:55:10,847 --> 00:55:13,151
I will ask no further free Quest

1069
00:55:13,407 --> 00:55:14,943
It's very complicated

1070
00:55:18,015 --> 00:55:18,783
Hear from the toy

1071
00:55:19,807 --> 00:55:22,367
That is the essence of what is globalist

1072
00:55:22,879 --> 00:55:23,903
Are establishing

1073
00:55:33,887 --> 00:55:36,447
Because the Bible says

1074
00:55:36,703 --> 00:55:39,007
Will come up

1075
00:55:43,871 --> 00:55:45,151
Are there

1076
00:55:46,943 --> 00:55:47,967
But one hour

1077
00:55:52,575 --> 00:55:56,159
Most of the Earth's population will be exterminated

1078
00:55:56,927 --> 00:55:58,975
2000 years ago that was written plush

1079
00:55:59,999 --> 00:56:01,535
2000 plus years ago

1080
00:56:02,303 --> 00:56:03,839
And then noticed

1081
00:56:04,351 --> 00:56:06,911
The world government wants to depopulate the Earth today

1082
00:56:08,447 --> 00:56:09,983
Revelations

1083
00:56:10,239 --> 00:56:11,519
Old Testament

1084
00:56:14,847 --> 00:56:17,151
In black and white

1085
00:56:17,663 --> 00:56:20,223
That's what I want

1086
00:56:20,479 --> 00:56:21,759
Because it's all there

1087
00:56:22,527 --> 00:56:23,039
So

1088
00:56:23,295 --> 00:56:25,599
First I want to I want to point out that Alex

1089
00:56:31,999 --> 00:56:33,023
He's going full-on

1090
00:56:33,279 --> 00:56:34,047
Christian doomsday /

1091
00:56:34,559 --> 00:56:38,143
For propaganda

1092
00:56:38,911 --> 00:56:40,959
The reflection of his diminished

1093
00:56:41,727 --> 00:56:42,495
His Radio present

1094
00:56:43,775 --> 00:56:44,287
Pretends it is

1095
00:56:44,543 --> 00:56:46,847
He's not allowed on any normal social media platform

1096
00:56:47,103 --> 00:56:50,175
Any more exist

1097
00:56:50,431 --> 00:56:54,527
Populated by other people who've been kicked off Facebook and Twitter for their white identity

1098
00:56:54,783 --> 00:56:55,295
Anti algae

1099
00:56:55,807 --> 00:56:57,343
SECU an anti-islam adjective

1100
00:56:58,367 --> 00:57:00,415
I have a strong suspicion that a lot of the audience

1101
00:57:00,671 --> 00:57:02,975
Still able to reach me also have some inclination

1102
00:57:03,231 --> 00:57:04,767
Towards absurd Christian

1103
00:57:05,535 --> 00:57:07,327
Which would understand

1104
00:57:07,583 --> 00:57:08,863
Taylor recovery

1105
00:57:09,631 --> 00:57:11,935
He's losing his mind and going towards

1106
00:57:12,191 --> 00:57:18,335
Intuit

1107
00:57:18,591 --> 00:57:20,383
Cuz Alex himself

1108
00:57:21,407 --> 00:57:21,919
Crass

1109
00:57:22,175 --> 00:57:24,479
It is

1110
00:57:24,735 --> 00:57:29,599
There's usually something behind you always look for a motivation that makes

1111
00:57:30,367 --> 00:57:31,647
Follow Occam's razor

1112
00:57:33,439 --> 00:57:35,231
Guide it'll be your Northstar without

1113
00:57:35,999 --> 00:57:40,351
Bit of religious

1114
00:57:40,607 --> 00:57:41,375
Different

1115
00:57:41,887 --> 00:57:42,399
The version of that

1116
00:57:42,911 --> 00:57:45,727
Another period covered in his career as a religion

1117
00:57:46,239 --> 00:57:48,031
Posted this level of Doomsday Prophecy

1118
00:57:48,543 --> 00:57:49,055
Videos

1119
00:57:49,311 --> 00:57:50,079
The Beast system

1120
00:57:50,335 --> 00:57:51,871
Mosquito with upon us

1121
00:57:52,895 --> 00:57:59,039
Beyond that it's nice to see Alex explaining that idea that he had about the devil taking over for God for an hour which we've heard him in Urdu

1122
00:57:59,295 --> 00:58:05,183
Commercial break I didn't know that

1123
00:58:06,975 --> 00:58:08,255
Scripture God is going to let the be

1124
00:58:08,511 --> 00:58:10,559
Pieces to be place for an hour which

1125
00:58:11,071 --> 00:58:12,095
Which makes

1126
00:58:17,215 --> 00:58:23,359
Year in God hours is that

1127
00:58:23,615 --> 00:58:26,687
Sewing hours

1128
00:58:27,967 --> 00:58:31,039
I can say categorically in with no hesitation

1129
00:58:31,295 --> 00:58:34,623
This is not what motivated him to resist the globalist earlier and

1130
00:58:35,647 --> 00:58:38,463
Back in the early 2000s is worried was about the globalist

1131
00:58:38,719 --> 00:58:41,535
Creating a One World Government which would rule forever

1132
00:58:41,791 --> 00:58:43,071
With no hope of a revolution

1133
00:58:43,327 --> 00:58:44,095
I'm against it 60

1134
00:58:44,607 --> 00:58:48,191
He imagined they would create a prison planet hence the name of his website

1135
00:58:48,703 --> 00:58:51,007
They were going to take over for a year

1136
00:58:51,775 --> 00:58:53,823
Initially the thought that he had and he was

1137
00:58:54,079 --> 00:58:54,847
Expressing scared me

1138
00:58:55,359 --> 00:58:57,407
But when I reflected on it more

1139
00:58:57,663 --> 00:58:58,175
Intuit

1140
00:58:58,687 --> 00:59:00,223
Because know what I want to say

1141
00:59:02,271 --> 00:59:03,551
I think it many ways it represent

1142
00:59:03,807 --> 00:59:05,343
2D escalation of his rhetoric

1143
00:59:05,855 --> 00:59:10,719
If this system is prophesied to only be in power for a year then it stands to reason that you could wait it out

1144
00:59:10,975 --> 00:59:13,791
It may be the best plan of action is doomsday prepping Behavior

1145
00:59:14,047 --> 00:59:15,839
As opposed to attacking your perceived enemy

1146
00:59:16,863 --> 00:59:21,983
I'm not sure that Alex is audience having been whipped up into a frenzy as they have already been will notice that's

1147
00:59:22,495 --> 00:59:23,007
Opportunity

1148
00:59:23,263 --> 00:59:24,287
But it's interesting

1149
00:59:26,591 --> 00:59:27,615
Train to Ski Resort

1150
00:59:27,871 --> 00:59:28,895
Has a built-in end

1151
00:59:30,175 --> 00:59:30,943
That kind of

1152
00:59:31,199 --> 00:59:32,479
He's at

1153
00:59:33,503 --> 00:59:34,015
A trapdoor

1154
00:59:34,527 --> 00:59:35,551
For his audience 2/2

1155
00:59:35,807 --> 00:59:36,575
Some sort of a hoe

1156
00:59:40,415 --> 00:59:41,695
It doesn't make any sense

1157
00:59:41,951 --> 00:59:43,231
If you believe in God

1158
00:59:43,743 --> 00:59:44,767
No I mean

1159
00:59:45,023 --> 00:59:48,863
No idea that

1160
00:59:49,119 --> 00:59:50,655
Going against God's will

1161
00:59:50,911 --> 00:59:54,495
Look I don't care about any of that

1162
00:59:54,751 --> 00:59:55,263
Pizzaville

1163
00:59:55,519 --> 00:59:58,591
It's not what I'm talkin about

1164
00:59:58,847 --> 00:59:59,615
Before

1165
01:00:00,383 --> 01:00:02,431
Alex

1166
01:00:02,687 --> 01:00:03,455
Almost everyone.

1167
01:00:03,967 --> 01:00:07,295
Exterminator

1168
01:00:07,551 --> 01:00:08,063
Lake

1169
01:00:08,831 --> 01:00:12,415
You're not going to be able to stop whatever this is

1170
01:00:12,671 --> 01:00:13,183
Thronecoming

1171
01:00:17,535 --> 01:00:19,327
You're not going to stop that from happening

1172
01:00:22,399 --> 01:00:25,983
Not in this is expressing here

1173
01:00:26,751 --> 01:00:28,287
If it's there for an hour

1174
01:00:28,799 --> 01:00:31,359
F****** get underground something

1175
01:00:36,479 --> 01:00:42,623
Underground

1176
01:00:42,879 --> 01:00:46,463
Go to the

1177
01:00:48,255 --> 01:00:51,327
Biotech on it might be generous

1178
01:00:51,583 --> 01:00:52,863
I think it's probably generous

1179
01:00:54,911 --> 01:00:56,703
That I have is that he's at least

1180
01:00:57,215 --> 01:00:58,495
Something's it allows

1181
01:00:58,751 --> 01:00:59,263
4

1182
01:01:00,543 --> 01:01:01,311
A healthier

1183
01:01:02,335 --> 01:01:02,847
Approach to be

1184
01:01:03,359 --> 01:01:03,871
Azadi

1185
01:01:04,639 --> 01:01:05,663
In the central

1186
01:01:05,919 --> 01:01:07,199
Prepping

1187
01:01:07,711 --> 01:01:08,991
The little paranoid and

1188
01:01:09,503 --> 01:01:12,319
May be misguided by it in a lot of cases

1189
01:01:13,343 --> 01:01:14,879
You know that the ideas like

1190
01:01:15,135 --> 01:01:15,647
Storing can

1191
01:01:15,903 --> 01:01:18,207
Food and haven't water been drunk

1192
01:01:18,463 --> 01:01:19,487
Stuff like that

1193
01:01:19,999 --> 01:01:23,327
It's not that unhealthy energy that Alex

1194
01:01:23,583 --> 01:01:25,119
Scares you into

1195
01:01:25,375 --> 01:01:26,399
Into doing that

1196
01:01:26,655 --> 01:01:27,423
As opposed

1197
01:01:27,679 --> 01:01:28,191
2

1198
01:01:28,703 --> 01:01:29,215
I don't know

1199
01:01:29,471 --> 01:01:30,239
Trying to

1200
01:01:32,287 --> 01:01:36,127
Parentheses parentheses

1201
01:01:36,383 --> 01:01:37,151
Yeah

1202
01:01:38,687 --> 01:01:39,967
Yelling about locking up Hillary

1203
01:01:40,223 --> 01:01:40,735
Political item

1204
01:01:41,759 --> 01:01:43,807
I'd rather have him take a proactive stance

1205
01:01:44,063 --> 01:01:48,927
It's two words preparation and

1206
01:01:49,183 --> 01:01:51,743
Yeah far too into it then

1207
01:01:51,999 --> 01:01:52,511
Probably

1208
01:01:52,767 --> 01:01:55,583
Deserves to be there

1209
01:01:58,143 --> 01:01:58,911
Listening to Alex

1210
01:01:59,167 --> 01:02:00,447
For quite a while I've never heard this

1211
01:02:03,007 --> 01:02:06,079
The Bible

1212
01:02:06,335 --> 01:02:06,847
It's just

1213
01:02:07,103 --> 01:02:07,615
Potential

1214
01:02:08,127 --> 01:02:09,663
Point it is aspiration

1215
01:02:10,943 --> 01:02:17,087
What what

1216
01:02:17,343 --> 01:02:17,855
Biblical Pizza

1217
01:02:18,879 --> 01:02:19,903
Revelation 13

1218
01:02:20,415 --> 01:02:20,927
Discusses the beat

1219
01:02:21,695 --> 01:02:24,511
And verse 5 specifically lay that how long the Beast will be given

1220
01:02:24,767 --> 01:02:26,559
Empower and guess what it's not an hour

1221
01:02:27,839 --> 01:02:29,631
There was given unto him a mouse

1222
01:02:29,887 --> 01:02:31,167
Speaking great things and blasphemies

1223
01:02:31,679 --> 01:02:33,215
And power was given unto him to

1224
01:02:33,471 --> 01:02:34,239
Continue 40 +

1225
01:02:35,519 --> 01:02:36,287
What's 42 months

1226
01:02:36,543 --> 01:02:37,311
Or 3

1227
01:02:38,079 --> 01:02:43,455
Were they still on the Gregorian calendar whatever

1228
01:02:43,711 --> 01:02:46,527
So who knows later in Revelation

1229
01:02:46,783 --> 01:02:48,063
17 vs 11

1230
01:02:48,319 --> 01:02:49,599
12

1231
01:02:49,855 --> 01:02:52,927
The Beast who was and now he's not is an 18

1232
01:02:53,439 --> 01:02:55,743
He belongs to the seven and is go at is going

1233
01:02:56,255 --> 01:02:57,023
To his destruction

1234
01:02:59,583 --> 01:03:04,447
Who have not yet received the kingdom but who for 1 hour will receive authority of Kings along with

1235
01:03:05,215 --> 01:03:05,983
I just want to say

1236
01:03:06,495 --> 01:03:07,007
Great job

1237
01:03:07,519 --> 01:03:08,031
John

1238
01:03:08,287 --> 01:03:10,591
Let's read

1239
01:03:11,103 --> 01:03:12,639
Really loved it make

1240
01:03:12,895 --> 01:03:14,175
Clear present

1241
01:03:15,455 --> 01:03:17,247
I think you did a great job

1242
01:03:17,759 --> 01:03:23,391
Just retroactively just want to let you know that big ol thumbs up

1243
01:03:24,671 --> 01:03:26,463
There is that our in the Bible

1244
01:03:26,719 --> 01:03:27,999
Is something

1245
01:03:29,279 --> 01:03:30,047
Word

1246
01:03:30,303 --> 01:03:30,815
From it

1247
01:03:33,375 --> 01:03:35,423
Cuz obviously Alex is trying to appeal to

1248
01:03:35,679 --> 01:03:36,959
His interpretation of the Bible

1249
01:03:37,215 --> 01:03:38,495
There's nothing I can really do with it

1250
01:03:42,079 --> 01:03:43,103
To prove that he's wrong

1251
01:03:43,359 --> 01:03:43,871
It is Imagine

1252
01:03:44,127 --> 01:03:45,407
Code isn't the right way

1253
01:03:45,663 --> 01:03:46,175
Text

1254
01:03:46,687 --> 01:03:47,199
So I'm

1255
01:03:47,455 --> 01:03:50,271
I kind of came to an impasse was like well that's what you think

1256
01:03:51,039 --> 01:03:52,319
Disgust

1257
01:03:52,575 --> 01:03:53,599
A little bit more

1258
01:03:53,855 --> 01:03:54,879
Explore what

1259
01:03:55,135 --> 01:03:55,647
He's doing

1260
01:03:56,415 --> 01:04:01,023
Revelation is one of the highest-profile examples ever of a genre known as apocalypse

1261
01:04:01,279 --> 01:04:01,791
Dick literature

1262
01:04:02,303 --> 01:04:04,351
Early Jewish writings

1263
01:04:04,607 --> 01:04:06,143
Send the text I primarily to

1264
01:04:06,399 --> 01:04:06,911
Two functions of

1265
01:04:07,935 --> 01:04:10,239
The first was to explain why

1266
01:04:11,775 --> 01:04:13,311
The second was to make

1267
01:04:13,567 --> 01:04:15,615
The awful condition

1268
01:04:15,871 --> 01:04:18,175
When presumably God is good and all-powerful

1269
01:04:18,943 --> 01:04:22,783
Pre Exile prophets issue prophecies

1270
01:04:23,295 --> 01:04:26,111
Like for instance the Jewish people returned from Exile in Babylon

1271
01:04:26,367 --> 01:04:27,903
But

1272
01:04:28,159 --> 01:04:29,439
True other parts.

1273
01:04:29,951 --> 01:04:30,463
Visitors

1274
01:04:30,719 --> 01:04:31,231
Problem

1275
01:04:31,487 --> 01:04:32,767
To be sorted out so the prophet

1276
01:04:33,023 --> 01:04:38,143
It's reinterpreted these older prophecies to show that quote promised Glory

1277
01:04:38,399 --> 01:04:38,911
Where you at

1278
01:04:39,167 --> 01:04:39,679
Come

1279
01:04:39,935 --> 01:04:42,239
The older Prophets

1280
01:04:42,495 --> 01:04:45,823
An invasion of Judah by enemies from the court which never came

1281
01:04:46,847 --> 01:04:49,663
Thus Ezekiel assault

1282
01:04:49,919 --> 01:04:51,967
By God upon Jerusalem

1283
01:04:52,223 --> 01:04:53,759
Which from that point onward has

1284
01:04:54,783 --> 01:04:55,295
Futurama

1285
01:04:55,551 --> 01:04:56,319
Literature

1286
01:04:57,343 --> 01:04:57,855
God

1287
01:04:58,367 --> 01:05:03,231
And my dog earlier

1288
01:05:03,487 --> 01:05:06,303
Prophecies by like Jeremiah

1289
01:05:06,815 --> 01:05:09,119
It never ended up happening

1290
01:05:09,375 --> 01:05:10,655
Interpreted as

1291
01:05:10,911 --> 01:05:12,447
The end of times that we're still yet

1292
01:05:12,703 --> 01:05:13,983
In order to make sense

1293
01:05:15,519 --> 01:05:16,543
Came through and the other part

1294
01:05:16,799 --> 01:05:22,943
Version of the guy who did math and he was like I figured out

1295
01:05:23,199 --> 01:05:26,271
Cyberpunk

1296
01:05:26,527 --> 01:05:31,391
Probably less manipulative

1297
01:05:31,647 --> 01:05:33,183
Crassly the modern-day

1298
01:05:33,439 --> 01:05:34,463
People buy

1299
01:05:36,511 --> 01:05:37,791
There was a bourse

1300
01:05:38,047 --> 01:05:38,815
There's a

1301
01:05:39,071 --> 01:05:41,631
Entire social purpose that they were probably work

1302
01:05:41,887 --> 01:05:43,167
Georgia

1303
01:05:43,935 --> 01:05:47,263
Maya prophesied that the Messianic Kingdom would return with

1304
01:05:52,127 --> 01:05:52,639
Years to min

1305
01:05:53,407 --> 01:05:55,711
Which was almost at its end

1306
01:05:56,223 --> 01:05:57,503
The Apocalypse of Baruch

1307
01:05:57,759 --> 01:06:01,087
Fourth

1308
01:06:01,343 --> 01:06:01,855
Again

1309
01:06:02,111 --> 01:06:03,391
When the span of time had passed

1310
01:06:04,671 --> 01:06:05,183
Didn't arrive

1311
01:06:05,695 --> 01:06:06,207
So this is a

1312
01:06:06,719 --> 01:06:08,255
Thread that goes throughout the tradition

1313
01:06:08,767 --> 01:06:10,303
Yep somebody make something up

1314
01:06:10,559 --> 01:06:13,375
The next person is like

1315
01:06:16,447 --> 01:06:16,959
So to the second

1316
01:06:17,471 --> 01:06:19,007
I think it's pretty self-explanatory

1317
01:06:19,263 --> 01:06:21,567
Conditions for the common person in the 500

1318
01:06:22,079 --> 01:06:22,847
We're not very great

1319
01:06:23,359 --> 01:06:24,895
Especially compared to what they would have

1320
01:06:25,151 --> 01:06:25,663
Expected

1321
01:06:25,919 --> 01:06:26,943
The prophecies about the lavish

1322
01:06:27,199 --> 01:06:27,967
Kingdom that was to come

1323
01:06:28,479 --> 01:06:31,295
Many people suffered which felt out of line with previous prophecies

1324
01:06:31,551 --> 01:06:35,391
Stone explanation was needed to show people that the prosperity and good luck

1325
01:06:35,647 --> 01:06:37,695
Was still on the Verizon

1326
01:06:38,719 --> 01:06:40,255
This tradition of liturgy

1327
01:06:40,511 --> 01:06:42,815
Literature evolved over the years until the right

1328
01:06:43,583 --> 01:06:45,375
Considered to be the first fully mature apocalypse

1329
01:06:47,935 --> 01:06:48,447
Send text

1330
01:06:48,703 --> 01:06:49,215
Because the question

1331
01:06:49,471 --> 01:06:49,983
Turn of authorship

1332
01:06:50,751 --> 01:06:54,591
It described 22 as being written by Daniel

1333
01:06:55,359 --> 01:06:56,639
But Scholars don't believe that

1334
01:06:57,151 --> 01:06:59,199
Possible

1335
01:07:00,223 --> 01:07:01,247
7216

1336
01:07:02,527 --> 01:07:03,039
Somewhere in there

1337
01:07:03,551 --> 01:07:06,623
One of the chief reasons for this is that there's a weird thing that happens

1338
01:07:06,879 --> 01:07:07,647
Israelites

1339
01:07:07,903 --> 01:07:08,415
To the accuracy

1340
01:07:08,671 --> 01:07:09,183
Prophecy

1341
01:07:09,951 --> 01:07:11,231
Everything to Daniel predict

1342
01:07:11,743 --> 01:07:13,279
At the beginning of the book matches up with

1343
01:07:13,535 --> 01:07:14,047
Historical event

1344
01:07:14,559 --> 01:07:16,607
But at the point of the book where he predicts the circum

1345
01:07:17,119 --> 01:07:20,703
Answers of the death of Antiochus the fourth everything falls apart

1346
01:07:28,383 --> 01:07:34,527
Set a timer for parallel

1347
01:07:34,783 --> 01:07:40,927
No spoilers it is

1348
01:07:41,183 --> 01:07:42,975
Interesting

1349
01:07:43,487 --> 01:07:47,839
He gets the death of Antiochus wrong and they predict the war that never happened

1350
01:07:48,095 --> 01:07:51,167
General the predictions past that point Booker Market

1351
01:07:51,423 --> 01:07:55,775
Detached from what we know from the historical in Stark opposition to the beginning of the book

1352
01:07:56,543 --> 01:07:58,079
Scholars believe the book was written during the

1353
01:07:58,335 --> 01:07:59,615
Miss. It should be understood in this

1354
01:07:59,871 --> 01:08:00,383
Contacts

1355
01:08:00,639 --> 01:08:02,687
At the time Antiochus representative

1356
01:08:02,943 --> 01:08:03,711
Existential threat to

1357
01:08:03,967 --> 01:08:04,735
The Jewish community

1358
01:08:04,991 --> 01:08:08,063
So the prophecy of his death in the coming Kingdom served

1359
01:08:08,831 --> 01:08:10,623
Dark time

1360
01:08:10,879 --> 01:08:12,671
It reinforced The credibility this

1361
01:08:12,927 --> 01:08:15,999
The author of Daniel used

1362
01:08:16,255 --> 01:08:17,535
Which allow them to use

1363
01:08:18,047 --> 01:08:19,327
From history

1364
01:08:19,583 --> 01:08:21,119
Predictions Daniel what is made

1365
01:08:21,375 --> 01:08:22,655
Of the hundreds of years that it happen

1366
01:08:23,423 --> 01:08:27,775
It's like one of our psychic

1367
01:08:28,031 --> 01:08:34,175
Well we don't have any evidence of you predicting that before the

1368
01:08:34,943 --> 01:08:38,015
Right we only have evidence of you sing predicted

1369
01:08:38,783 --> 01:08:40,575
Revelation doesn't exist in a vacuum

1370
01:08:40,831 --> 01:08:42,623
It has to be approached and understood Within

1371
01:08:42,879 --> 01:08:44,415
Apocalyptic literature

1372
01:08:44,671 --> 01:08:46,975
Mostly because the book entirely relies on the

1373
01:08:48,767 --> 01:08:49,791
The references to it

1374
01:08:50,047 --> 01:08:53,375
Revelation is held up by the final battle ideas

1375
01:08:54,911 --> 01:08:55,935
Reinterpreting prophecies

1376
01:08:57,215 --> 01:09:01,055
The beat it has a prophecy uses prophecies as a tool of political speech

1377
01:09:01,567 --> 01:09:02,847
In the same vein

1378
01:09:03,359 --> 01:09:09,503
It's an insanely complicated thing that many people spend lifetime studying scholarships

1379
01:09:10,015 --> 01:09:11,551
Wise to look at any of these books

1380
01:09:11,807 --> 01:09:13,599
It's containing literal coded message

1381
01:09:13,855 --> 01:09:14,879
Just that we should use to predict

1382
01:09:15,647 --> 01:09:16,159
That is

1383
01:09:16,671 --> 01:09:17,183
A silly things

1384
01:09:21,791 --> 01:09:27,935
At this point I was going to list off all the people who have tried to use Revelation in there

1385
01:09:29,727 --> 01:09:31,007
I write the list is too long

1386
01:09:31,263 --> 01:09:32,287
And all of them have been

1387
01:09:32,543 --> 01:09:34,335
Equally and completely wrong

1388
01:09:34,591 --> 01:09:36,383
Consider that

1389
01:09:36,639 --> 01:09:37,151
In the history

1390
01:09:37,407 --> 01:09:38,431
That we have

1391
01:09:40,735 --> 01:09:45,855
That's hubris pretty brazen

1392
01:09:46,367 --> 01:09:50,719
For anybody with the recorded history that we have

1393
01:09:51,231 --> 01:09:51,743
Even if just

1394
01:09:53,279 --> 01:09:53,791
You could get it

1395
01:09:54,047 --> 01:09:55,327
History

1396
01:09:56,607 --> 01:09:57,375
Have the balls

1397
01:09:57,887 --> 01:10:00,959
To try and make Revelation base predictions about the future

1398
01:10:01,471 --> 01:10:03,263
It just seems like you have to be

1399
01:10:03,775 --> 01:10:04,799
I mean you're pissing in the Wind

1400
01:10:06,079 --> 01:10:06,847
I mean okay

1401
01:10:07,359 --> 01:10:08,383
It's it's like

1402
01:10:09,663 --> 01:10:12,223
It's like sucking Eldorado you know

1403
01:10:13,247 --> 01:10:18,623
For Eldorado you're probably going to die and you're never going to find it

1404
01:10:20,671 --> 01:10:21,183
What

1405
01:10:21,439 --> 01:10:27,583
What is my alarm

1406
01:10:31,423 --> 01:10:34,495
Personal Achievement there's no wind except for us

1407
01:10:34,751 --> 01:10:36,031
Like it really

1408
01:10:37,823 --> 01:10:39,871
From these people who abused revelation

1409
01:10:40,127 --> 01:10:43,199
To predict the end times

1410
01:10:43,711 --> 01:10:47,551
Supreme Douglas Adams

1411
01:10:49,343 --> 01:10:51,903
Apocalypse

1412
01:10:52,159 --> 01:10:53,183
Who accidentally gets it

1413
01:10:53,951 --> 01:10:58,559
You know like the guy who's scamming everybody

1414
01:11:02,911 --> 01:11:07,263
And Alex will be wrong as well

1415
01:11:07,519 --> 01:11:08,287
Because

1416
01:11:08,543 --> 01:11:09,311
It doesn't lead

1417
01:11:09,567 --> 01:11:11,359
To anything other than having to revise

1418
01:11:11,615 --> 01:11:12,127
Your prediction

1419
01:11:12,383 --> 01:11:18,527
Wants it doesn't come true I do admire on some level that he's resisted the urge to say a specific date

1420
01:11:19,039 --> 01:11:25,183
Show some restraint is still there

1421
01:11:25,439 --> 01:11:31,583
I admire you more if you pick a certain date then if you just give me a

1422
01:11:31,839 --> 01:11:35,167
No it's over it's not the world

1423
01:11:36,191 --> 01:11:39,775
What other related to Alex Jones and all these people who try to weaponize revelation

1424
01:11:40,031 --> 01:11:41,823
And for the road and I would like to quote to them

1425
01:11:42,079 --> 01:11:42,847
Deuteronomy 8

1426
01:11:43,359 --> 01:11:44,383
21 + 20

1427
01:11:52,575 --> 01:11:55,135
How shall we know the word which the Lord have not spoken

1428
01:11:55,903 --> 01:12:00,511
When a prophet speaketh in the name of the Lord is the things follow not nor come to pass

1429
01:12:04,095 --> 01:12:05,119
But the prophet has

1430
01:12:05,375 --> 01:12:06,399
Spoken a prism

1431
01:12:07,167 --> 01:12:08,703
Thou shalt not be afraid of him

1432
01:12:09,471 --> 01:12:10,751
You heard it first in the Bible

1433
01:12:11,007 --> 01:12:14,335
Don't be afraid of Alex Jones

1434
01:12:14,591 --> 01:12:15,359
Very wrong

1435
01:12:15,615 --> 01:12:19,967
Very wrong Deuteronomy is telling us that the

1436
01:12:20,223 --> 01:12:25,087
Mark of someone who is a false prophet is he says things that don't come to pass

1437
01:12:25,855 --> 01:12:26,367
Alex

1438
01:12:26,879 --> 01:12:28,415
You sir are biblically

1439
01:12:28,671 --> 01:12:30,207
A false prophet

1440
01:12:30,463 --> 01:12:31,487
But the Bible is wrong

1441
01:12:31,999 --> 01:12:34,047
You should be afraid of false prophets

1442
01:12:34,303 --> 01:12:39,423
It's because they will f*** your s*** up maybe not on a otherworldly level but on a

1443
01:12:39,679 --> 01:12:41,727
On this world

1444
01:12:42,751 --> 01:12:44,031
I'm through Alex

1445
01:12:45,055 --> 01:12:47,615
We kind of understand Apocalypto

1446
01:12:47,871 --> 01:12:49,407
Take literature and how Revelations

1447
01:12:50,943 --> 01:12:52,479
Use to make future predict

1448
01:12:53,247 --> 01:12:53,759
Alex

1449
01:12:54,015 --> 01:12:54,527
Still is

1450
01:12:54,783 --> 01:12:55,551
Is on that

1451
01:12:55,807 --> 01:12:56,319
Tip

1452
01:12:56,575 --> 01:12:58,111
Bible prophecy is

1453
01:12:59,647 --> 01:13:05,791
World Government clone humans

1454
01:13:06,047 --> 01:13:12,191
And all of us here

1455
01:13:12,447 --> 01:13:15,775
There's a master behind

1456
01:13:16,287 --> 01:13:21,151
There is a literal devil and that also there is a literal guy that Alex is working

1457
01:13:22,431 --> 01:13:22,943
He's not

1458
01:13:23,199 --> 01:13:24,479
Some guy

1459
01:13:25,247 --> 01:13:26,527
Is doing the radio show

1460
01:13:26,783 --> 01:13:28,319
He's a tool of divinity

1461
01:13:31,391 --> 01:13:32,159
It's not

1462
01:13:33,439 --> 01:13:34,207
Easy to forget that you think

1463
01:13:34,719 --> 01:13:37,535
Are we sure the music isn't

1464
01:13:38,303 --> 01:13:39,071
Because having like

1465
01:13:39,327 --> 01:13:43,167
Oregon directly behind him while he

1466
01:13:43,423 --> 01:13:43,935
He's giving these

1467
01:13:44,447 --> 01:13:45,727
Apocalyptic predictions

1468
01:13:45,983 --> 01:13:46,495
It's like

1469
01:13:47,007 --> 01:13:51,103
Are you self-aware you know he's f****** with us

1470
01:13:55,967 --> 01:13:56,991
I feel like a staff is doing

1471
01:13:57,503 --> 01:13:58,015
Habitat now

1472
01:13:58,271 --> 01:14:00,063
Like the people he could get to employ

1473
01:14:00,319 --> 01:14:04,671
I don't know if any of them were that clever

1474
01:14:05,183 --> 01:14:05,951
Like slight Rebellion

1475
01:14:11,839 --> 01:14:12,351
Talk

1476
01:14:16,447 --> 01:14:17,727
Literature 2

1477
01:14:17,983 --> 01:14:23,359
And now we're going to get really into the standard model

1478
01:14:23,615 --> 01:14:26,431
Woodstock

1479
01:14:28,223 --> 01:14:29,503
Science

1480
01:14:30,271 --> 01:14:33,343
That the global is there going to be in charge of for an hour

1481
01:14:33,855 --> 01:14:39,231
Google Steve already been in charge for a long time according to Alex

1482
01:14:39,487 --> 01:14:45,631
Know the time

1483
01:14:47,167 --> 01:14:47,679
Pennywise

1484

Stockings

1485

Traitor

1486
01:15:12,511 --> 01:15:16,351
Music

1487
01:15:24,031 --> 01:15:25,055
Dude

1488
01:15:25,311 --> 01:15:31,455
Going to kill you

Steely Dan

1490
01:15:32,991 --> 01:15:35,551
I wasn't feeling it still

1491
01:15:36,831 --> 01:15:38,623
You might notice there those little aggressive

1492
01:15:38,879 --> 01:15:39,647
Donuts break

1493
01:15:41,695 --> 01:15:44,767
To notice the characterizes almost Alex

1494
01:15:45,023 --> 01:15:45,791
In this episode

1495
01:15:46,303 --> 01:15:48,863
It's something I've seen a lot of presents

1496
01:15:49,375 --> 01:15:53,983
With shocking regularity goes that's breaking the globalist want to kill you and your family

1497
01:15:54,239 --> 01:15:55,519
Ramping up the fear these trying

01:15:55,775 --> 01:15:56,287
How to create newsletter

Mirraw when he returns her break

1500
01:15:58,847 --> 01:16:00,127
He generally doesn't have that same intense

1501
01:16:02,175 --> 01:16:04,479
Comes back from break bragging about it

1502
01:16:05,247 --> 01:16:08,575
Like this segment right here that it began

1503
01:16:08,831 --> 01:16:10,367
Within playing Supercut of people on the

1504
01:16:10,623 --> 01:16:11,391

Wally talked over the video saying stuff like

1506
01:16:15,231 --> 01:16:19,071
Employees just too popular everyone loves in the globalist had to silence

1507
01:16:19,327 --> 01:16:22,399
Congratulatory thing coming in

1508
01:16:22,655 --> 01:16:23,167
The brakes

1509
01:16:23,423 --> 01:16:27,775
You saw through the b******* you know

1510
01:16:29,311 --> 01:16:32,127
When you're heading into a commercial break your number one job is to

1511
01:16:32,383 --> 01:16:32,895
To keep people

Turning the dial

1513
01:16:34,431 --> 01:16:35,967
This is why new shows do that embarrassing

01:16:36,223 --> 01:16:38,783
Clickbait type story thing where they're always

1515
01:16:39,039 --> 01:16:42,879
Trying to kill your child come back at 5

1516
01:16:43,135 --> 01:16:46,463
We will get you after the break will tell you about the threat to your child

1517
01:16:48,255 --> 01:16:48,767
Trend

1518
01:16:49,023 --> 01:16:49,535
Exist

1519
01:16:49,791 --> 01:16:54,143
In poorly done exploitative media

1520
01:16:54,399 --> 01:16:55,679
Happening a lot more in Alec

1521
01:16:56,191 --> 01:16:58,495
I know that we had a lot of laughs over the years

1522
01:16:58,751 --> 01:16:59,263
About Alex

1523
01:16:59,519 --> 01:17:00,287
Yelling out to break

1524
01:17:00,543 --> 01:17:02,079
And of course

1525
01:17:02,335 --> 01:17:03,359
But please trust me

1526
01:17:03,615 --> 01:17:07,455
Someone who's Listen to More Infowars than anyone ever should it's noticeable

1527
01:17:07,711 --> 01:17:08,991
30s doing it a lot more lately

1528
01:17:09,759 --> 01:17:13,599
If I had to Hazard a guess I would say that because his numbers are really down

1529
01:17:13,855 --> 01:17:15,135
I have to use whatever tricky

1530
01:17:15,391 --> 01:17:16,415
To keep people around

1531
01:17:16,671 --> 01:17:21,023
I'm no expert and I've no hard data to support this although if you look on Alexa is

1532
01:17:21,279 --> 01:17:21,791
Is traffic

1533
01:17:22,047 --> 01:17:22,815
Going downward

1534
01:17:23,327 --> 01:17:26,399
But it's hard not to read this is anything other than pure desperation

1535
01:17:26,911 --> 01:17:27,423
On display

1536
01:17:27,679 --> 01:17:28,959
The only thing Alex has left

1537
01:17:29,215 --> 01:17:29,983
To offer his audience

1538
01:17:30,239 --> 01:17:30,751
Bortles

1539
01:17:31,519 --> 01:17:33,055
He's having a f****** Easter sale on

1540
01:17:33,567 --> 01:17:35,103
Is trying to terrify people

1541
01:17:39,455 --> 01:17:40,479
To the science question

1542
01:17:42,271 --> 01:17:42,783
Omniscience

1543
01:17:46,367 --> 01:17:47,903
The question of where Alex

1544
01:17:48,159 --> 01:17:50,207
Fear has landed

1545
01:17:50,463 --> 01:17:53,023
Scale of crazy versus reasonable

1546
01:17:53,791 --> 01:17:56,351
I can't deny that there are

1547
01:17:56,607 --> 01:17:57,375
Express concern about

1548
01:17:58,143 --> 01:17:58,911
Exposure to radio

1549
01:17:59,679 --> 01:18:01,471
How they could have unintended help concert

1550
01:18:02,239 --> 01:18:05,823
So don't seem like it's something that Alex is making up out of thin air

1551
01:18:06,079 --> 01:18:06,591
Spider-Man

1552
01:18:07,871 --> 01:18:14,015
With radio waves

1553
01:18:14,271 --> 01:18:19,391
The problem with taking the Alex might be out of sort of reasonable appears when you get into

1554
01:18:20,927 --> 01:18:21,951
The reason

1555
01:18:22,207 --> 01:18:25,023
Concerned about the increased health risk I asked to do with the increase

1556
01:18:25,279 --> 01:18:26,559
If the number of transmitters

1557
01:18:28,863 --> 01:18:30,911
What you think about their specific

1558
01:18:31,167 --> 01:18:33,983
Is the not just talkin about 5

1559
01:18:34,239 --> 01:18:35,007
Is what they're concerned about

1560
01:18:35,775 --> 01:18:38,335
The scientist or talk about this stuff pretty regularly

1561
01:18:38,591 --> 01:18:40,127
That it would be just as bad

1562
01:18:41,151 --> 01:18:42,175
G4g or Wi-Fi

1563
01:18:42,687 --> 01:18:45,759
The problem for them is all wireless communication

1564
01:18:46,271 --> 01:18:48,831
To accurately Champion the closet

1565
01:18:49,087 --> 01:18:50,111
Using a thesaurus

1566
01:18:50,367 --> 01:18:51,903
You'd have to take it to that level

1567
01:18:52,159 --> 01:18:53,183
He got rid of

1568
01:18:53,439 --> 01:18:54,719
You wouldn't be able to use that

1569
01:18:54,975 --> 01:18:55,487
Peace

1570
01:18:55,743 --> 01:18:57,279
The uses for staff to talk to him

1571
01:18:58,303 --> 01:19:00,607
I am going to ask this question

1572
01:19:00,863 --> 01:19:02,655
So very simple and base

1573
01:19:03,935 --> 01:19:06,239
They know what

1574
01:19:06,495 --> 01:19:07,007
5G

1575
01:19:08,543 --> 01:19:09,311
What do you mean Alex

1576
01:19:09,567 --> 01:19:11,871
Yeah I mean any of these like 5G

1577
01:19:12,127 --> 01:19:13,407
Cruisers or whatever

1578
01:19:13,663 --> 01:19:14,943
I'm probably that

1579
01:19:15,967 --> 01:19:16,479
So

1580
01:19:16,735 --> 01:19:17,759
But it doesn't matter

1581
01:19:18,015 --> 01:19:19,039
They don't still care about

1582
01:19:23,391 --> 01:19:23,903
He's just a

1583
01:19:24,159 --> 01:19:26,207
The fifth generation of the same

1584
01:19:26,463 --> 01:19:28,511
Context conceptual radio

1585
01:19:31,071 --> 01:19:32,607
Top of the Rock

1586
01:19:32,863 --> 01:19:37,983
No

1587
01:19:39,263 --> 01:19:41,567
Could you could make a decent argument based on

1588
01:19:42,591 --> 01:19:43,871
The factory

1589
01:19:44,127 --> 01:19:44,639
She is

1590
01:19:44,895 --> 01:19:45,407
Using

1591
01:19:45,663 --> 01:19:46,431
Parts of the

1592
01:19:46,687 --> 01:19:47,967
Spectrum Spectrum

1593
01:19:48,223 --> 01:19:49,503
That don't travel as far

1594
01:19:49,759 --> 01:19:52,575
So they do need to put up a bunch more transmitter

1595
01:19:52,831 --> 01:19:53,343
In order to

1596
01:19:53,599 --> 01:19:54,111
Coverage

1597
01:19:54,367 --> 01:19:55,135
For the 5

1598
01:19:55,391 --> 01:19:57,951
That works okay

1599
01:19:59,231 --> 01:19:59,999
Radio freq

1600
01:20:02,047 --> 01:20:02,559
Based on

1601
01:20:03,583 --> 01:20:05,375
Intrinsic misunderstanding

1602
01:20:06,655 --> 01:20:09,215
It doesn't require the

1603
01:20:09,471 --> 01:20:11,007
Piggybacking it

1604
01:20:11,263 --> 01:20:14,336
They're just haters up everyone would have

1605
01:20:14,592 --> 01:20:15,360
More of this

1606
01:20:15,616 --> 01:20:16,128
Radio freq

1607
01:20:17,152 --> 01:20:18,688
Bombarding them and that

1608
01:20:18,944 --> 01:20:20,480
Is benefit

1609
01:20:20,992 --> 01:20:22,272
Right I suppose

1610
01:20:23,040 --> 01:20:25,600
Okay so there is the

1611
01:20:25,856 --> 01:20:26,624
Turtle of

1612
01:20:26,880 --> 01:20:33,024
I would need to read up a lot more before reporting

1613
01:20:33,280 --> 01:20:34,816
If it's a new story at all

1614
01:20:35,328 --> 01:20:37,632
He posted an article on Infowars over the weekend

1615
01:20:38,912 --> 01:20:41,472
Hundreds of respected scientist sound the alarm about health

1616
01:20:41,728 --> 01:20:42,240
Affect

1617
01:20:42,496 --> 01:20:44,288
Has 5G networks go up Nationwide

1618
01:20:45,056 --> 01:20:45,568
Wichita

1619
01:20:45,824 --> 01:20:48,384
Scientists are currently sounding the alarm

1620
01:20:48,640 --> 01:20:49,152
Which is not the case

1621
01:20:50,176 --> 01:20:51,712
Back on September 13th

1622
01:20:51,968 --> 01:20:52,992
2017

1623
01:20:53,248 --> 01:20:54,784
When 180 scientist

1624
01:20:55,040 --> 01:20:55,808
Doctor's appeal to

1625
01:20:56,064 --> 01:20:57,600
The European Union about 5G

1626
01:20:57,856 --> 01:21:02,976
Asking them to put a moratorium on rolling out the technology until there were appropriate

1627
01:21:03,488 --> 01:21:06,304
They were appealing to the EU because the EU

1628
01:21:06,560 --> 01:21:07,328
Tone of money

1629
01:21:07,584 --> 01:21:08,864
Making preparations and researching

1630
01:21:09,120 --> 01:21:09,632
45 G

1631
01:21:09,888 --> 01:21:11,424
So it seemed like a good place to go

1632
01:21:12,192 --> 01:21:13,728
In response to their petition

1633
01:21:13,984 --> 01:21:16,288
You clarified the quote the responsibility

1634
01:21:16,544 --> 01:21:21,664
For protecting the public from the potential harmful effects of electromagnetic fields remains

1635
01:21:21,920 --> 01:21:23,968
Including the choice of measures adopted

1636
01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:26,272
So if you understand that response

1637
01:21:28,576 --> 01:21:31,392
Have the Sovereign decision of whether or not to adopt

1638
01:21:31,648 --> 01:21:33,440
5G it's a states rights

1639
01:21:33,696 --> 01:21:38,560
No one is forcing anyone other than I guess the sovereign

1640
01:21:39,840 --> 01:21:40,352
To implement

1641
01:21:40,864 --> 01:21:44,960
Maybe like it's the federal government saying that is it is after the states

1642
01:21:45,216 --> 01:21:49,824
Horse that's being a sovereign country is about

1643
01:21:50,080 --> 01:21:51,360
Of those countries who don't

1644
01:21:55,968 --> 01:21:56,736
Discussion but whatever

1645
01:21:57,248 --> 01:21:59,040
Do you clearly has a firm in their position

1646
01:22:00,576 --> 01:22:06,208
And that's really something that Alex doesn't wanted to stop

1647
01:22:06,464 --> 01:22:07,488
To his idea of

1648
01:22:07,744 --> 01:22:09,024
The EU taking away States

1649
01:22:10,304 --> 01:22:16,448
Ultimately the more I look into 5G question of it the less concerned about it in the more I feel like as the manufacturer

1650
01:22:16,960 --> 01:22:18,496
Freakout narratives it Alex's basics

1651
01:22:19,264 --> 01:22:20,032
Small turtles

1652
01:22:20,800 --> 01:22:21,824
Bayan and used

1653
01:22:22,080 --> 01:22:23,104
Jumping from therein

1654
01:22:23,360 --> 01:22:23,872
Too irresponsible

1655
01:22:26,432 --> 01:22:26,944
Scientist

1656
01:22:27,456 --> 01:22:28,992
At the Advent of the fuc

1657
01:22:29,248 --> 01:22:32,320
Kingradio that weren't like

1658
01:22:32,576 --> 01:22:34,624
I'm positive

1659
01:22:37,952 --> 01:22:39,744
Concerns about the potential health effects

1660
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:40,768
And they're not

1661
01:22:41,024 --> 01:22:47,168
Messerli lunatics or doctors who aren't doctor

1662
01:22:47,424 --> 01:22:53,568
Alex or manifest

1663
01:22:53,824 --> 01:22:56,384
What quackery would be based on

1664
01:22:56,640 --> 01:22:57,408
Some scientist

1665
01:22:57,920 --> 01:22:58,432
That raise

1666
01:23:00,992 --> 01:23:02,528
What are the big things

1667
01:23:02,784 --> 01:23:03,552
Anti 5G

1668
01:23:04,064 --> 01:23:05,088
2 as evidence

1669
01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:08,160
Is that the international agency

1670
01:23:08,416 --> 01:23:12,000
For research on cancer Has Lifted radio frequency electromagnetic field

1671
01:23:12,256 --> 01:23:13,792
Possibly carcinogenic

1672
01:23:15,840 --> 01:23:17,376
Well it's rarely pointed out the

1673
01:23:17,632 --> 01:23:18,400
But the iarc

1674
01:23:18,912 --> 01:23:20,192
His only five categories

1675
01:23:20,448 --> 01:23:20,960
These were things

1676
01:23:21,472 --> 01:23:22,752
There's carcinogenic

1677
01:23:23,008 --> 01:23:24,032
Probably carcinogenic

1678
01:23:24,544 --> 01:23:25,824
Possibly carcinogenic

1679
01:23:26,080 --> 01:23:27,616
Probably not person agenda

1680
01:23:27,872 --> 01:23:29,152
And not classifiable

1681
01:23:29,408 --> 01:23:35,040
Strongly agree with

1682
01:23:35,296 --> 01:23:37,088
You disagree with that or do you

1683
01:23:37,344 --> 01:23:39,136
Disagree with that are strongly disagree with

1684
01:23:41,440 --> 01:23:43,232
Things like aluminum production

1685
01:23:43,488 --> 01:23:49,632
Or the Epstein-Barr virus

1686
01:23:51,168 --> 01:23:52,448
Anabolic steroids

1687
01:23:52,704 --> 01:23:55,008
Or working as a hairdresser or Barber

1688
01:23:55,264 --> 01:23:58,336
Are listed as possibly probably carcinogenic

1689
01:23:58,592 --> 01:23:59,104
As is

1690
01:23:59,360 --> 01:23:59,872
Eating red

1691
01:24:00,128 --> 01:24:01,664
Or drink beverages hotter than sick

1692
01:24:01,920 --> 01:24:03,712
65 degrees Celsius

1693
01:24:03,968 --> 01:24:04,992
Those are probably

1694
01:24:06,016 --> 01:24:07,552
Is there a hairdresser who likes

1695
01:24:07,808 --> 01:24:10,624
Drinking really hot things

1696
01:24:11,392 --> 01:24:12,160
Included in the

1697
01:24:12,416 --> 01:24:14,976
Possibly carcinogenic category

1698
01:24:15,488 --> 01:24:16,768
The radio frequency

1699
01:24:17,024 --> 01:24:17,536
MC radiation

1700
01:24:18,048 --> 01:24:19,584
Here's some of the things that are in that category

1701
01:24:20,608 --> 01:24:22,144
Being a firefighter

1702
01:24:22,400 --> 01:24:23,168
On Wednesday

1703
01:24:23,424 --> 01:24:24,192
Dry cleaning

1704
01:24:24,448 --> 01:24:25,984
Exposure to gasoline

1705
01:24:26,240 --> 01:24:27,008
Car exhaust

1706
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:30,080
Pickled vegetable right and aloe vera

1707
01:24:30,592 --> 01:24:32,896
The definition for inclusion in that group is quote

1708
01:24:33,152 --> 01:24:34,176
There's some evidence

1709
01:24:34,432 --> 01:24:37,760
Vera can cause cancer in humans but it present it is far from conclusive

1710
01:24:39,040 --> 01:24:40,832
This is this context is really important

1711
01:24:41,088 --> 01:24:43,648
Since it explains what researchers mean when they say certain things

1712
01:24:44,160 --> 01:24:45,184
The technical meaning of

1713
01:24:45,440 --> 01:24:46,976
Possibly to the iarc

1714
01:24:47,488 --> 01:24:48,256
Is different than what it mean

1715
01:24:48,768 --> 01:24:52,096
Conversationally and Alex and his cohorts are taking advantage

1716
01:24:52,352 --> 01:24:55,168
Of that difference of definition

1717
01:24:55,424 --> 01:24:58,496
Manipulating

1718
01:24:58,752 --> 01:24:59,776
Is almost like

1719
01:25:00,800 --> 01:25:01,568
Chronicle of

1720
01:25:01,824 --> 01:25:02,848
Modern inventions

1721
01:25:03,360 --> 01:25:05,920
If you want to exist in a relatively modern

1722
01:25:06,176 --> 01:25:07,456
In space you're probably going to

1723
01:25:08,480 --> 01:25:09,760
With possibly carcinogenic

1724
01:25:11,040 --> 01:25:12,832
Partially true partially

1725
01:25:13,344 --> 01:25:14,112
Not quite

1726
01:25:14,368 --> 01:25:17,440
Because a lot of them end up in the NOC category category risible

1727
01:25:17,696 --> 01:25:18,976
Area

1728
01:25:19,232 --> 01:25:21,280
Yeah because there aren't studies

1729
01:25:22,304 --> 01:25:26,912
Category

1730
01:25:27,168 --> 01:25:28,192
He's some kind of a study that

1731
01:25:28,448 --> 01:25:31,520
Is indicated if possible but nothing

1732
01:25:32,800 --> 01:25:36,128
I need a smaller list

1733
01:25:36,384 --> 01:25:37,408
Aloe vera and pickles

1734
01:25:38,944 --> 01:25:45,088
It's because those are things that are there

1735
01:25:45,344 --> 01:25:47,904
Not regularly eating platypus

1736
01:25:51,232 --> 01:25:52,000
That were study

1737
01:25:57,632 --> 01:25:58,400
Catholic Church

1738
01:25:58,656 --> 01:26:01,984
Oh I didn't know that

1739
01:26:02,496 --> 01:26:08,640
You can't eat red meat on Fridays or whatever for whatever reasons was probably person

1740
01:26:08,896 --> 01:26:10,176
Beavers

1741
01:26:10,432 --> 01:26:11,200
Fish

1742
01:26:11,968 --> 01:26:12,480
Cuz they live in water

1743
01:26:12,736 --> 01:26:14,016
Catholic trivia

1744
01:26:15,808 --> 01:26:19,648
So the LA Times article Alex is talking about there also

1745
01:26:19,904 --> 01:26:20,672
It's from August 8th

1746
01:26:22,208 --> 01:26:23,232
And talks about

1747
01:26:23,488 --> 01:26:27,328
Study that was done with

1748
01:26:27,584 --> 01:26:28,096
Found quotes

1749
01:26:28,608 --> 01:26:29,120
Small increase

1750
01:26:29,376 --> 01:26:30,656
Preseason tumors in male rats

1751
01:26:31,424 --> 01:26:32,704
And makes it clear that quote

1752
01:26:32,960 --> 01:26:34,752
Extrapolating the results to humans

1753
01:26:35,008 --> 01:26:35,520
It's complicated

1754
01:26:36,032 --> 01:26:38,080
The article comes from a quote

1755
01:26:38,336 --> 01:26:38,848
Include

1756
01:26:39,104 --> 01:26:41,664
I don't think it's clear that there are helpers

1757
01:26:42,176 --> 01:26:44,480
There are no help

1758
01:26:45,504 --> 01:26:46,272
Says Lee Kaku

1759
01:26:47,040 --> 01:26:49,856
Epidemiology professor at UCLA

1760
01:26:50,112 --> 01:26:50,624
School of public

1761
01:26:50,880 --> 01:26:52,928
Who is study the effects of cell phone

1762
01:26:53,440 --> 01:26:56,000
Yeah that's such a responsible thing to say it

1763
01:26:56,256 --> 01:27:02,400
Yuri atr8 so call back later

1764
01:27:02,656 --> 01:27:06,240
The point

1765
01:27:06,752 --> 01:27:09,824
That's the point of the article but it doesn't make a good headline

1766
01:27:11,104 --> 01:27:13,664
And so you make a more Sensational headline

1767
01:27:14,944 --> 01:27:15,456
Science

1768
01:27:15,712 --> 01:27:19,296
Results inconclusive should be the headline of just about every

1769
01:27:21,344 --> 01:27:23,904
I'm not too worried about this 5G stuff

1770
01:27:24,160 --> 01:27:26,720
And I don't think Alex is on good footing

1771
01:27:26,976 --> 01:27:27,488
If I can get some

1772
01:27:27,744 --> 01:27:28,512
First footing

1773
01:27:28,768 --> 01:27:30,048
Okay little bit later

1774
01:27:30,304 --> 01:27:31,840
Cuz he starts talking about Islam

1775
01:27:32,608 --> 01:27:37,216
You remember how he was getting really revelatory

1776
01:27:37,472 --> 01:27:38,240
Revelation

1777
01:27:38,496 --> 01:27:44,640
Stuff earlier Revelation to Muslims

1778
01:27:44,896 --> 01:27:45,664
Smell that shitt I don't want

1779
01:27:46,176 --> 01:27:48,480
It's not good

1780
01:27:48,992 --> 01:27:51,296
Wow unfortunately we live in this world

1781
01:27:51,552 --> 01:27:52,064
Alex

1782
01:27:52,320 --> 01:27:53,088
World

1783
01:27:53,344 --> 01:27:54,368
Is Express in the world

1784
01:27:54,624 --> 01:27:55,904
Wishes to see

1785
01:27:56,160 --> 01:27:56,672
Oh that's not

1786
01:27:57,696 --> 01:27:58,208
This is Joe

1787
01:28:02,304 --> 01:28:03,584
That's why they're bringing in

1788
01:28:03,840 --> 01:28:06,400
Muslims

1789
01:28:07,424 --> 01:28:07,936
That's why

1790
01:28:11,008 --> 01:28:13,312
Don't talk about what Muslim

1791
01:28:13,824 --> 01:28:16,384
Ascertain

1792
01:28:19,200 --> 01:28:19,712
Just pee

1793
01:28:19,968 --> 01:28:20,480
People

1794
01:28:20,736 --> 01:28:21,248
Have

1795
01:28:22,272 --> 01:28:22,784
A reticent

1796
01:28:23,808 --> 01:28:24,320
Except

1797
01:28:24,832 --> 01:28:25,600
U-save-it certain

1798
01:28:26,112 --> 01:28:26,880
Religion

1799
01:28:27,648 --> 01:28:28,160
Compatible

1800
01:28:28,416 --> 01:28:28,928
With

1801
01:28:29,440 --> 01:28:30,464
Good Society

1802
01:28:31,232 --> 01:28:32,512
I think that that is

1803
01:28:33,536 --> 01:28:35,840
Like it's not no one saying don't talk about is

1804
01:28:36,352 --> 01:28:37,888
Don't think don't talk about Muslim

1805
01:28:38,656 --> 01:28:39,168
They're saying

1806
01:28:40,448 --> 01:28:41,216
Yeah

1807
01:28:41,728 --> 01:28:44,800
Don't do what you just did in that quick

1808
01:28:45,312 --> 01:28:49,152
Boils down to about a seventh of the entire population of the

1809
01:28:49,408 --> 01:28:49,920
The human race

1810
01:28:50,176 --> 01:28:51,712
Is fundamentally in

1811
01:28:51,968 --> 01:28:53,248
Compatible with the other sick

1812
01:28:54,272 --> 01:28:55,552
Which leads to extermination

1813
01:28:55,808 --> 01:28:56,576
Mission is immoral

1814
01:28:58,368 --> 01:28:59,648
Complete isolation

1815
01:29:03,232 --> 01:29:06,560
There's no other resolutions

1816
01:29:06,816 --> 01:29:07,584
Restrained

1817
01:29:07,840 --> 01:29:10,656
Benevolent solution to whatever

1818
01:29:10,912 --> 01:29:16,800
Do you know what

1819
01:29:17,056 --> 01:29:18,848
Do all Muslims go to Australia

1820
01:29:19,104 --> 01:29:21,408
And you stay there and we barricaded it around

1821
01:29:22,176 --> 01:29:23,712
That's insane

1822
01:29:24,992 --> 01:29:25,504
So

1823
01:29:25,760 --> 01:29:27,040
Eva's next clip Alex

1824
01:29:27,296 --> 01:29:28,320
Explain

1825
01:29:28,832 --> 01:29:29,344
Is feeling

1826
01:29:29,600 --> 01:29:30,112
On

1827
01:29:30,368 --> 01:29:31,392
Islam

1828
01:29:32,160 --> 01:29:32,672
Himself

1829
01:29:33,440 --> 01:29:33,952
Is

1830
01:29:35,744 --> 01:29:36,512
This is troubling

1831
01:29:37,024 --> 01:29:37,536
Disturbing

1832
01:29:38,304 --> 01:29:38,816
But

1833
01:29:39,072 --> 01:29:39,840
I also think

1834
01:29:41,888 --> 01:29:42,656
Trim the video

1835
01:29:44,192 --> 01:29:45,984
We're early in the episode you was talking

1836
01:29:46,240 --> 01:29:47,008
About how

1837
01:29:47,520 --> 01:29:51,360
She doesn't want martial law but the globalists are making them do it

1838
01:29:51,616 --> 01:29:52,128
Course

1839
01:29:52,640 --> 01:29:55,200
It's sort of the same thing

1840
01:29:56,992 --> 01:29:58,016
How to get rid of all the Muslims

1841
01:29:58,272 --> 01:29:59,040
But they're making me

1842
01:30:00,064 --> 01:30:00,576
He's being

1843
01:30:00,832 --> 01:30:02,880
Forced into this position or at least that

1844
01:30:05,184 --> 01:30:06,208
It's exactly that

1845
01:30:06,464 --> 01:30:06,976
It's

1846
01:30:07,744 --> 01:30:09,792
Pathetic way to be

1847
01:30:10,048 --> 01:30:11,328
Little monster

1848
01:30:12,096 --> 01:30:13,632
And I want to explain something

1849
01:30:13,888 --> 01:30:14,656
Personally

1850
01:30:15,424 --> 01:30:16,192
Joel McHale

1851
01:30:16,704 --> 01:30:17,472
Open the middle

1852
01:30:18,752 --> 01:30:20,800
I personally don't want to be at war with Muslim

1853
01:30:21,056 --> 01:30:21,824
Cuz you're a coward

1854
01:30:22,080 --> 01:30:24,128
Globalist plan

1855
01:30:24,384 --> 01:30:25,920
For Clash of civilizations

1856
01:30:29,504 --> 01:30:31,808
But if your daughter gets kicked out of subway

1857
01:30:33,088 --> 01:30:33,600
Stairs

1858
01:30:34,112 --> 01:30:35,904
Byram islamicize cuz they

1859
01:30:36,160 --> 01:30:37,440
You know that she's a profane

1860
01:30:37,952 --> 01:30:40,512
Dog creature cuz she's a Christian or whatever

1861
01:30:41,280 --> 01:30:43,840
The police the media try to cover it up and that's long

1862
01:30:52,288 --> 01:30:53,824
On the coastline

1863
01:30:54,080 --> 01:30:56,128
The defense of the Muslims that's War

1864
01:30:56,384 --> 01:30:57,152
And that's wrong

1865
01:30:57,408 --> 01:30:58,944
We already know from covering

1866
01:30:59,200 --> 01:31:00,736
Stuff that I don't know what's

1867
01:31:01,248 --> 01:31:04,320
Stories talking about or if there even is one

1868
01:31:04,576 --> 01:31:05,088
Kick downstairs

1869
01:31:05,344 --> 01:31:08,928
But I know that that cross storyline

1870
01:31:09,184 --> 01:31:09,696
That doesn't give

1871
01:31:09,952 --> 01:31:11,744
Give me much hope that the other stories

1872
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:13,792
Are being accurately reported here

1873
01:31:15,328 --> 01:31:17,120
Application for why Islam is at

1874
01:31:18,656 --> 01:31:24,800
You're at you're starting off on a bad foot know I was I was listening to that and I was thinking maybe our solution

1875
01:31:25,056 --> 01:31:25,568
4

1876
01:31:25,824 --> 01:31:28,128
City propaganda and how awful our media is

1877
01:31:28,640 --> 01:31:30,432
The hole is not deplatforming

1878
01:31:31,456 --> 01:31:33,504
What it is is putting a referee

1879
01:31:33,760 --> 01:31:35,296
In every live

1880
01:31:38,368 --> 01:31:44,512
What he's like when your daughter gets emotional manipulation

1881
01:31:45,024 --> 01:31:51,168
I suggested that is the punishment for episode

1882
01:31:51,424 --> 01:31:53,216
That was years ago

1883
01:31:55,776 --> 01:31:57,312
I just wanted to point out that that is

1884
01:31:58,592 --> 01:32:00,896
Cross story

1885
01:32:02,944 --> 01:32:03,968
You're stupid

1886
01:32:04,224 --> 01:32:05,760
It's a manipulated Collision

1887
01:32:06,784 --> 01:32:08,832
I understand it's a manipulating Clash

1888
01:32:09,856 --> 01:32:10,624
But it doesn't

1889
01:32:10,880 --> 01:32:12,928
The fact if you're

1890
01:32:13,184 --> 01:32:14,976
On the receiving end.

1891
01:32:21,120 --> 01:32:22,912
There is a class of civilizations happening

1892
01:32:23,168 --> 01:32:24,704
The globalist program

1893
01:32:25,216 --> 01:32:27,264
We must be honest about the cancer

1894
01:32:29,056 --> 01:32:31,616
That has become Islam in this current

1895
01:32:35,200 --> 01:32:35,712
And the fact

1896
01:32:36,992 --> 01:32:37,760
Systems cancer

1897
01:32:41,344 --> 01:32:43,904
Mainline churches

1898
01:32:44,160 --> 01:32:44,928
Epitome cancer

1899
01:32:45,440 --> 01:32:46,208
It's not

1900
01:32:46,720 --> 01:32:47,232
Good

1901
01:32:47,744 --> 01:32:48,256
2

1902
01:32:48,512 --> 01:32:49,024
Here

1903
01:32:49,536 --> 01:32:50,304
Because I mean

1904
01:32:50,560 --> 01:32:51,328
It's not good

1905
01:32:51,584 --> 01:32:52,096
Because

1906
01:32:54,400 --> 01:32:56,192
Globalist and the last girl can't

1907
01:32:57,984 --> 01:32:59,008
Throwing in the main

1908
01:32:59,520 --> 01:33:01,056
Christian churches is also

1909
01:33:01,312 --> 01:33:01,824
Kind of

1910
01:33:02,336 --> 01:33:02,848
Terrifying

1911
01:33:03,104 --> 01:33:03,616
Because

1912
01:33:04,128 --> 01:33:05,664
Would you sing the mainstream Christian

1913
01:33:05,920 --> 01:33:08,736
Churches are cancer those are the ones that are going to be more tolerant

1914
01:33:09,248 --> 01:33:11,040
So if you are not in a lake

1915
01:33:12,320 --> 01:33:13,600
Christian Church

1916
01:33:14,112 --> 01:33:17,440
That believes in his belief

1917
01:33:17,952 --> 01:33:23,840
Then they are a Cancer as well that you should get out of that church they're misrepresenting God.

1918
01:33:24,096 --> 01:33:24,608
See what he say

1919
01:33:26,656 --> 01:33:32,800
Right just like just like that thought that the tea party was a leftist group

1920
01:33:33,056 --> 01:33:39,200
Like that kind of scam

1921
01:33:39,456 --> 01:33:44,064
Like the glitterbug

1922
01:33:44,320 --> 01:33:46,880
I don't know if he does specifically

1923
01:33:47,136 --> 01:33:48,160
Keywords

1924
01:33:48,672 --> 01:33:53,536
Exactly I don't know I am not positive I've heard him

1925
01:33:54,048 --> 01:33:56,352
Come down on her either either way but

1926
01:33:56,608 --> 01:33:57,120
I.

1927
01:33:57,376 --> 01:34:00,192
I think that it's more the churches that

1928
01:34:04,032 --> 01:34:06,592
Church

1929
01:34:08,128 --> 01:34:10,688
So you talkin about this and I was

1930
01:34:10,944 --> 01:34:11,712
Hearing it

1931
01:34:12,224 --> 01:34:13,760
I thought like well

1932
01:34:14,272 --> 01:34:15,040
On brand

1933
01:34:15,296 --> 01:34:17,344
For now for president

1934
01:34:17,600 --> 01:34:19,136
But at the same time it is

1935
01:34:19,392 --> 01:34:20,160
In the context

1936
01:34:20,416 --> 01:34:20,928
They're talking about

1937
01:34:21,184 --> 01:34:21,952
Apocalyptic Santa

1938
01:34:22,208 --> 01:34:23,232
WWE

1939
01:34:23,488 --> 01:34:24,768
You get this

1940
01:34:25,024 --> 01:34:26,304
There's something really f***** up that

1941
01:34:26,816 --> 01:34:27,328
Communicating

1942
01:34:27,840 --> 01:34:30,400
Understand exactly what he was

1943
01:34:30,656 --> 01:34:31,680
Other than just

1944
01:34:32,960 --> 01:34:33,728
Killing time

1945
01:34:33,984 --> 01:34:40,128
Even people and saying it's not our fault that we're demonizing you you made a threat

1946
01:34:40,384 --> 01:34:40,896
Understand

1947
01:34:41,152 --> 01:34:42,944
Practice was being laid until

1948
01:34:43,200 --> 01:34:45,504
He starts playing a video the Tommy Robin

1949
01:34:50,368 --> 01:34:51,392
Well

1950
01:34:51,904 --> 01:34:52,672
I'll just explain

1951
01:34:52,928 --> 01:34:53,952
I imagine him

1952
01:34:54,208 --> 01:34:56,512
In whatever video you're about to play

1953
01:34:56,768 --> 01:34:58,816
I imagine him as Dick Van Dyke

1954
01:34:59,072 --> 01:35:02,400
Doing a shity cockney accent wearing a Nazi uniform

1955
01:35:02,912 --> 01:35:04,448
And that's not right.

1956
01:35:04,704 --> 01:35:05,984
That's how I'm imagine

1957
01:35:06,496 --> 01:35:07,008
Inaccurate

1958
01:35:10,592 --> 01:35:11,104
Of his event

1959
01:35:11,360 --> 01:35:12,128
Tommy Robinson

1960
01:35:12,384 --> 01:35:13,408
I thought about it long

1961
01:35:13,664 --> 01:35:15,712
In hard and there's only one thing I really want

1962
01:35:16,480 --> 01:35:19,040
Before but I'd like to double and triple down

1963
01:35:19,296 --> 01:35:20,832
And that is suck Tommy Roberts

1964
01:35:22,112 --> 01:35:28,000
Tell me he's running for office

1965
01:35:29,536 --> 01:35:32,352
It is video he specifies that he's going to work in class

1966
01:35:32,608 --> 01:35:33,120
West Townsend

1967
01:35:33,376 --> 01:35:34,656
From everything in this video

1968
01:35:34,912 --> 01:35:39,264
Yeah and everything of the video I've seen I'd be hard-pressed to find to non-white people in the footage

1969
01:35:40,032 --> 01:35:43,360
He specifically even says that he's avoiding places with Muslim population

1970
01:35:45,152 --> 01:35:46,176
People

1971
01:35:46,432 --> 01:35:47,712
Given Tommy's career

1972
01:35:47,968 --> 01:35:51,296
Is believes his lifelong pattern of criminality is lifelong Association

1973
01:35:51,552 --> 01:35:52,576
With Nazi white supremacist

1974
01:35:52,832 --> 01:35:53,600
This group's is document

1975
01:35:53,856 --> 01:35:55,136
History resorting to violence

1976
01:35:55,392 --> 01:35:57,184
Tire brands

1977
01:35:57,440 --> 01:35:58,720
Funny flavored islamophobia

1978
01:35:58,976 --> 01:35:59,488
It's not hard

1979
01:35:59,744 --> 01:36:00,256
See what he's doing

1980
01:36:00,768 --> 01:36:04,352
He knows God damn well that he doesn't have a chance of winning the f****** dog catcher election

1981
01:36:04,864 --> 01:36:06,144
And this political campaign

1982
01:36:06,400 --> 01:36:08,448
Rules to carry out his anti-muslim

1983
01:36:08,704 --> 01:36:09,728
Anti-islam agitate

1984
01:36:10,240 --> 01:36:11,264
Particularly now that he's

1985
01:36:11,520 --> 01:36:12,544
Kicked off social media

1986
01:36:13,056 --> 01:36:15,872
Didn't go to predominantly white working-class areas and give campaign

1987
01:36:16,384 --> 01:36:18,176
Is what you knows will be disrupted eventually

1988
01:36:18,432 --> 01:36:19,968
Which will then give him the perfect Optics

1989
01:36:20,224 --> 01:36:21,248
Continue with b*******

1990
01:36:21,504 --> 01:36:22,272
For another cycle

1991
01:36:22,528 --> 01:36:23,808
And get more

1992
01:36:27,136 --> 01:36:29,696
Tommy was giving a speech in Oldham on

1993
01:36:29,952 --> 01:36:30,976
Saturday May 8th

1994
01:36:31,744 --> 01:36:32,768
And there's a large faction the folks

1995
01:36:33,024 --> 01:36:34,304
Who showed up

1996
01:36:34,816 --> 01:36:36,352
Some through eggs in Brick

1997
01:36:36,608 --> 01:36:37,632
Those

1998
01:36:37,888 --> 01:36:39,424
Might not have been Brixton vitamin rocks

1999
01:36:39,680 --> 01:36:40,192
I'm not entirely sure

2000
01:36:40,960 --> 01:36:42,496
Tommy could not have been happier

2001
01:36:42,752 --> 01:36:44,032
You can kind of see it in the video

2002
01:36:44,288 --> 01:36:45,824
You smirking while you talked about the event

2003
01:36:46,336 --> 01:36:47,872
Everything purple

2004
01:36:48,384 --> 01:36:49,408
A group of white families

2005
01:36:49,664 --> 01:36:51,456
Just trying to support the political process

2006
01:36:51,712 --> 01:36:53,504
Attacked by a group of unruly Muslim

2007
01:36:54,016 --> 01:36:58,112
He got all the footage of children being put in cars where yells in the bullhorn

2008
01:36:58,368 --> 01:36:59,136
About

2009
01:36:59,392 --> 01:37:01,440
How you need to be concerned for their safety

2010
01:37:01,696 --> 01:37:02,720
Children being attacked

2011
01:37:03,488 --> 01:37:05,024
Obviously I worry for those kids safety

2012
01:37:05,280 --> 01:37:05,792
Absolutely

2013
01:37:06,048 --> 01:37:09,376
But I also worry about their parents choices bring them to a f****** Tommy Robin

2014
01:37:10,144 --> 01:37:12,448
Before he even got involved in politics

2015
01:37:12,704 --> 01:37:13,216
He been arrested

2016
01:37:13,472 --> 01:37:14,496
3 x 4 violin

2017
01:37:15,008 --> 01:37:17,824
Including one-time in 2005 when he assaulted an off-duty

2018
01:37:18,080 --> 01:37:19,872
Cop who tried to break up an altercation

2019
01:37:20,128 --> 01:37:22,944
Between him and his girlfriend who was issued a citation

2020
01:37:23,200 --> 01:37:24,736
For being in possession of cocaine

2021
01:37:25,504 --> 01:37:28,320
Every Behavior has gotten less safe for kids to be around since then

2022
01:37:29,088 --> 01:37:31,136
I'm not blaming those parents fully but it's

2023
01:37:32,672 --> 01:37:33,696
To not know what you're getting

2024
01:37:34,208 --> 01:37:34,720
To going to a

2025
01:37:34,976 --> 01:37:35,488
Tommy Robinson

2026
01:37:36,768 --> 01:37:38,048
Has a particular character

2027
01:37:38,304 --> 01:37:39,328
You know what's going to happen

2028
01:37:39,584 --> 01:37:40,352
Yeah

2029
01:37:40,608 --> 01:37:41,632
I do not endorse

2030
01:37:41,888 --> 01:37:43,168
The people throwing rocks at Tommy

2031
01:37:43,424 --> 01:37:46,496
I strongly disapprove of non milkshake now

2032
01:37:46,752 --> 01:37:47,264
No Rock

2033
01:37:47,776 --> 01:37:50,336
I disapprove of non milkshake related violence

2034
01:37:50,848 --> 01:37:51,616
And even more than that

2035
01:37:51,872 --> 01:37:53,408
This is exactly the outcome Tommy

2036
01:37:53,920 --> 01:37:55,200
He gets to be the victim

2037
01:37:55,456 --> 01:37:56,480
Use these videos as a

2038
01:37:56,736 --> 01:38:00,064
Powerful recruitment tool ticket Vince white people that they're under attack from

2039
01:38:01,088 --> 01:38:01,856
No.2

2040
01:38:02,112 --> 01:38:02,880
It applies this for me

2041
01:38:03,648 --> 01:38:07,232
I don't support what these people did but I wholeheartedly support the political message

2042
01:38:08,256 --> 01:38:10,560
Which boils down to f*** you Tommy Robinson

2043
01:38:11,072 --> 01:38:14,400
Which is something that you could hear every day they would be nearly enough never

2044
01:38:14,912 --> 01:38:20,288
Big deal out of Tommy's very manipulative video about what happened to him and how Islam

2045
01:38:20,544 --> 01:38:23,872
Eagle

2046
01:38:24,384 --> 01:38:25,152
I'm not interested

2047
01:38:25,408 --> 01:38:28,992
Deconstructing what he's all about I think we all pretty much seasons game for what it is

2048
01:38:29,248 --> 01:38:30,272
There are a couple points

2049
01:38:30,528 --> 01:38:32,576
They'll wear Alex's commentary on the video drift

2050
01:38:32,832 --> 01:38:33,600
Did the territory work

2051
01:38:33,856 --> 01:38:34,624
Become relevant for us

2052
01:38:34,880 --> 01:38:35,392
To discuss

2053
01:38:35,648 --> 01:38:37,184
So they receive those clips in here

2054
01:38:37,440 --> 01:38:40,000
A little bit of tommy's video under Alex

2055
01:38:40,512 --> 01:38:42,048
Which is mostly just a

2056
01:38:42,560 --> 01:38:43,072
Explain District

2057
01:38:44,096 --> 01:38:44,864
Here is

2058
01:38:45,120 --> 01:38:47,680
Alex play the video again

2059
01:38:48,192 --> 01:38:48,704
Vicki said something

2060
01:38:48,960 --> 01:38:49,472
It's very telling

2061
01:39:03,040 --> 01:39:09,184
Is pretty explicitly expressing

2062
01:39:09,440 --> 01:39:09,952
Nationalist

2063
01:39:15,328 --> 01:39:20,704
There's no Homeland for the white man

2064
01:39:21,216 --> 01:39:26,848
Is Christian

2065
01:39:28,128 --> 01:39:33,504
Christian like there are no Christians in Africa come out

2066
01:39:33,760 --> 01:39:37,344
Is very explicitly the language

2067
01:39:37,600 --> 01:39:39,392
Uses

2068
01:39:39,648 --> 01:39:40,416
Instead of

2069
01:39:40,672 --> 01:39:41,952
People's Christian

2070
01:39:42,208 --> 01:39:43,744
You know what he's doing

2071
01:39:44,000 --> 01:39:45,280
What is edit

2072
01:39:45,536 --> 01:39:46,560
Pathetically

2073
01:39:47,072 --> 01:39:47,584
Transparent

2074
01:39:48,352 --> 01:39:52,960
It's really bad

2075
01:39:53,472 --> 01:39:54,496
That's so

2076
01:39:55,008 --> 01:39:56,544
God I'm just bummed

2077
01:39:56,800 --> 01:39:59,360
You did

2078
01:39:59,616 --> 01:40:00,896
Just use the word

2079
01:40:01,152 --> 01:40:02,176
Use the word

2080
01:40:08,064 --> 01:40:08,576
They are

2081
01:40:09,088 --> 01:40:09,600
As jay-dub

2082
01:40:12,160 --> 01:40:14,464
Alex's something

2083
01:40:14,720 --> 01:40:15,488
You said

2084
01:40:15,744 --> 01:40:16,256
Episode

2085
01:40:17,024 --> 01:40:20,096
Firenze apartment

2086
01:40:20,352 --> 01:40:26,496
England

2087
01:40:27,520 --> 01:40:31,360
Top

2088
01:40:31,872 --> 01:40:35,968
So when we did that crossover episode with qanon anonymous

2089
01:40:36,224 --> 01:40:38,528
Made a point about that

2090
01:40:38,784 --> 01:40:39,296
Traitors

2091
01:40:44,928 --> 01:40:45,440
That's what Alex

2092
01:40:46,720 --> 01:40:47,744
Do you think those cops

2093
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:50,816
Are mad because he's not a traitor to his people

2094
01:40:52,352 --> 01:40:53,376
Hoo-boy

2095
01:40:53,632 --> 01:40:56,704
You know it sure seems like it would

2096
01:40:59,776 --> 01:41:01,312
I don't know if I was exaggerating

2097
01:41:06,176 --> 01:41:10,016
A lot of that I used to describe these people has been

2098
01:41:10,272 --> 01:41:11,040
Lesson lesson

2099
01:41:11,296 --> 01:41:12,832
Extreme in regards to

2100
01:41:13,088 --> 01:41:13,600
Exaggeration

2101
01:41:14,880 --> 01:41:16,928
Yeah as we gathered more information

2102
01:41:17,184 --> 01:41:17,696
You've gotten

2103
01:41:17,952 --> 01:41:18,464
Less

2104
01:41:18,976 --> 01:41:20,000
Extreme with your rhetoric

2105
01:41:20,256 --> 01:41:21,024
Because we realized it

2106
01:41:21,280 --> 01:41:26,400
Or at least is your description

2107
01:41:27,424 --> 01:41:33,056
So what are things it's important to point out is that Alex is playing this video that highlights this

2108
01:41:33,312 --> 01:41:36,128
It's conflagration that happened at a time.

2109
01:41:36,384 --> 01:41:37,920
You know Tommy's history if you

2110
01:41:38,176 --> 01:41:39,712
You know what he's all about this

2111
01:41:39,968 --> 01:41:41,248
Exactly what he

2112
01:41:44,064 --> 01:41:47,904
Tinder and gasoline for somebody else

2113
01:41:50,976 --> 01:41:53,792
Is there fake or anything like that but it's exactly the sort of Optics

2114
01:41:54,048 --> 01:41:54,560
Tommy bags

2115
01:41:54,816 --> 01:41:55,328
Score cuz it's the

2116
01:41:55,584 --> 01:41:56,608
Kindling for the fire

2117
01:41:56,864 --> 01:41:57,888
That he knows how to build

2118
01:41:58,144 --> 01:41:58,912
Exactly

2119
01:41:59,168 --> 01:42:01,728
And it's important to point out that this video that Alex

2120
01:42:01,984 --> 01:42:03,520
Displaying is specifically

2121
01:42:03,776 --> 01:42:05,056
Materials

2122
01:42:05,568 --> 01:42:07,104
For Tommy's Run for the parliament

2123
01:42:07,872 --> 01:42:11,712
This is literally from a procedure

2124
01:42:11,968 --> 01:42:13,504
Never

2125
01:42:15,296 --> 01:42:16,832
Play the Muslim

2126
01:42:21,184 --> 01:42:27,328
Go

2127
01:42:27,584 --> 01:42:30,912
Paradise

2128
01:42:31,424 --> 01:42:34,240
So it's just a camp

2129
01:42:34,496 --> 01:42:35,008
Traders

2130
01:42:35,264 --> 01:42:36,544
Parliament

2131
01:42:37,056 --> 01:42:41,664
This family-friendly event

2132
01:42:42,944 --> 01:42:43,456
Black

2133
01:42:43,968 --> 01:42:44,480
Man

2134
01:42:45,248 --> 01:42:46,528
God he should not even be

2135
01:42:47,040 --> 01:42:48,064
You should not even be

2136
01:42:48,576 --> 01:42:49,856
Physically allowed to

2137
01:42:50,112 --> 01:42:51,136
Just say the words family

2138
01:42:52,928 --> 01:42:53,696
Censorship

2139
01:42:54,208 --> 01:42:55,232
Pro First Amendment

2140
01:42:55,488 --> 01:42:57,792
I also think we should take some words out people's

2141
01:42:58,560 --> 01:42:59,328
There's no first

2142
01:42:59,840 --> 01:43:00,864
UK

2143
01:43:03,168 --> 01:43:03,680
In a general sense

2144
01:43:03,936 --> 01:43:04,448
Alex

2145
01:43:04,960 --> 01:43:06,240
I'm all for free speech rights

2146
01:43:06,496 --> 01:43:08,800
He's not allowed to say Martin Luther King Junior 410

2147
01:43:09,056 --> 01:43:10,336
Or Huber

2148
01:43:19,808 --> 01:43:21,088
I just really think

2149
01:43:21,344 --> 01:43:21,856
Think that it's

2150
01:43:24,672 --> 01:43:25,696
Evokes

2151
01:43:25,952 --> 01:43:27,488
Exactly what it's supposed to

2152
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:28,512
Which is

2153
01:43:28,768 --> 01:43:31,584
This idea of a race war more or less

2154
01:43:32,096 --> 01:43:33,120
Milan news

2155
01:43:33,376 --> 01:43:34,144
If you will

2156
01:43:36,704 --> 01:43:37,728
It's a real bad luck

2157
01:43:39,776 --> 01:43:41,056
It's a baby when I was saying that

2158
01:43:42,592 --> 01:43:43,104
Apocalypse

2159
01:43:43,360 --> 01:43:44,896
Fix stuff with me 1 hour

2160
01:43:45,152 --> 01:43:45,920
Is maybe at the escalation

2161
01:43:46,176 --> 01:43:52,320
Go ahead and ignore all outside

2162
01:43:53,088 --> 01:43:54,624
I just was a stray thought

2163
01:43:55,136 --> 01:43:57,696
Anyway your little bit of Mark Dice

2164
01:43:57,952 --> 01:44:04,096
You've got a special report that Alex plays twice during the show

2165
01:44:05,632 --> 01:44:08,960
The marks

2166
01:44:09,472 --> 01:44:11,264
Syracuse

2167
01:44:11,776 --> 01:44:12,544
Apparently

2168
01:44:12,800 --> 01:44:14,592
Taken to making fun of Beto

2169
01:44:15,104 --> 01:44:18,432
Which I don't know why

2170
01:44:18,688 --> 01:44:19,712
I don't know how relevant

2171
01:44:20,736 --> 01:44:22,528
In the primary race

2172
01:44:23,040 --> 01:44:24,064
Less unless the time goes

2173
01:44:24,576 --> 01:44:27,136
I already think he's down in the lower tier

2174
01:44:27,392 --> 01:44:29,440
Of candidates who are running

2175
01:44:30,464 --> 01:44:32,768
But Mark Dice makes a meal out of making fun of him

2176
01:44:33,024 --> 01:44:33,792
In this clip

2177
01:44:34,048 --> 01:44:35,072
And then Alex said something really funny

2178
01:44:51,968 --> 01:44:58,112
What the Patriots game

2179
01:45:21,152 --> 01:45:22,944
Does pouring rain

2180
01:45:29,600 --> 01:45:30,880
Kimberly Goins

2181
01:45:39,072 --> 01:45:42,656
But it's a public place and you know what I mean

2182
01:45:43,424 --> 01:45:45,472
This made me want to mark.

2183
01:45:45,984 --> 01:45:49,056
The best videos ever

2184
01:45:49,312 --> 01:45:51,872
Wow.

2185
01:45:52,128 --> 01:45:58,272
Text Mark.

2186
01:46:03,136 --> 01:46:09,024
A boy taking out Beto and the Blasio

2187
01:46:09,280 --> 01:46:14,656
Emily timely Beavis and Butt-head reference pieces of information

2188
01:46:15,168 --> 01:46:15,680
About this

2189
01:46:16,192 --> 01:46:18,240
Looked into it

2190
01:46:18,752 --> 01:46:20,544
This first one I just listen

2191
01:46:21,056 --> 01:46:24,384
The clip that Mark Dice played person who complain

2192
01:46:24,640 --> 01:46:25,408
To the Blasio

2193
01:46:25,664 --> 01:46:26,688
Is this a good place

2194
01:46:26,944 --> 01:46:27,968
Get your message out cuz it's

2195
01:46:28,480 --> 01:46:28,992
Trump Tower

2196
01:46:29,248 --> 01:46:35,392
They're not mad at him for being a bad Trump Tower so

2197
01:46:35,904 --> 01:46:39,488
It doesn't really work for his argument

2198
01:46:41,024 --> 01:46:43,072
Into his marked Isis 41 f****** years old

2199
01:46:43,584 --> 01:46:44,352
That is a

2200
01:46:44,608 --> 01:46:46,144
Parasite

2201
01:46:46,400 --> 01:46:52,544
Embarrassing behavior for Asurion

2202
01:46:52,800 --> 01:46:53,312
Impression

2203
01:46:53,568 --> 01:46:54,592
Hawk

2204
01:46:54,848 --> 01:46:55,360
Call man

2205
01:46:56,384 --> 01:46:58,432
Happy birthday to forty-year-old Matt dreski friend

2206
01:46:58,688 --> 01:47:04,832
He's not making videos like that that's why I

2207
01:47:05,088 --> 01:47:07,648
Signified in Loctite

2208
01:47:08,416 --> 01:47:09,952
Holyshit

2209
01:47:10,464 --> 01:47:11,488
You got it

2210
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:13,792
That would be bad if I saw that Caitlin

2211
01:47:14,048 --> 01:47:16,096
Making it would be embarrassed

2212
01:47:16,352 --> 01:47:18,144
Anyone over

2213
01:47:19,168 --> 01:47:22,240
That kind that kind of behavior is

2214
01:47:23,008 --> 01:47:29,152
I would look down on anyone under 16 knowing a Beavis and Butt-head reference would be

2215
01:47:29,408 --> 01:47:31,712
Improve my estimation of

2216
01:47:31,968 --> 01:47:32,480
Possibly

2217
01:47:32,992 --> 01:47:34,272
I just need more style list

2218
01:47:35,296 --> 01:47:36,320
Less specific reference

2219
01:47:36,832 --> 01:47:37,600
Absolutely terrible

2220
01:47:37,856 --> 01:47:40,160
Squaw Valley

2221
01:47:40,416 --> 01:47:41,184
Described as hell

2222
01:47:41,696 --> 01:47:42,976
Climate

2223
01:47:43,488 --> 01:47:44,000
Spirit

2224
01:47:45,536 --> 01:47:47,072
He spells out a little bit of it

2225
01:47:49,120 --> 01:47:53,984
Government overreach

2226
01:47:54,752 --> 01:47:55,520
30 uses of the referee

2227
01:47:56,544 --> 01:47:57,056
Like a little

2228
01:47:57,824 --> 01:47:59,616
Specific real-world example

2229
01:48:03,456 --> 01:48:03,968
Necessarily

2230
01:48:04,224 --> 01:48:06,016
Offensive off the bat

2231
01:48:06,528 --> 01:48:07,040
It doesn't work for

2232
01:48:08,576 --> 01:48:09,600
He knows that no one listens

2233
01:48:09,856 --> 01:48:10,624
Make nose so

2234
01:48:12,160 --> 01:48:13,440
But do you see the total is

2235
01:48:27,008 --> 01:48:29,056
It's because everybody's underwater

2236
01:48:31,872 --> 01:48:33,920
And the world ending

2237
01:48:34,176 --> 01:48:35,968
In 12 years unless you do

2238
01:48:36,480 --> 01:48:38,272
Exactly what damasio

2239
01:48:47,232 --> 01:48:49,792
50% unemployment

2240
01:48:50,304 --> 01:48:51,840
25% unemployment General

2241
01:48:52,096 --> 01:48:52,608
The country

2242
01:48:52,864 --> 01:48:55,424
Has fallen apart it's been destroyed

2243
01:48:55,680 --> 01:48:57,728
This is an economic missile

2244
01:48:58,496 --> 01:49:01,568
To destroy economy

2245
01:49:02,080 --> 01:49:04,640
So Alex knows that his audience doesn't know any

2246
01:49:04,896 --> 01:49:05,664
Think about Spanish

2247
01:49:05,920 --> 01:49:06,432
Employment rate

2248
01:49:06,688 --> 01:49:09,248
Yeah

2249
01:49:14,112 --> 01:49:20,256
AP reported that Spain's unemployment rate currently

2250
01:49:20,512 --> 01:49:21,280
2013

2251
01:49:21,536 --> 01:49:26,400
14.45

2252
01:49:26,656 --> 01:49:28,192
Percent good looking

2253
01:49:28,448 --> 01:49:29,472
But whatever Alex

2254
01:49:29,728 --> 01:49:30,496
Discusses to testicle

2255
01:49:31,008 --> 01:49:31,776
Crucially important

2256
01:49:32,032 --> 01:49:32,800
Consider the context

2257
01:49:33,824 --> 01:49:37,408
What issues with Spain's economy is historically been characterized by high on a

2258
01:49:37,664 --> 01:49:38,688
Employment even in the best

2259
01:49:39,712 --> 01:49:42,784
When their economy was doing 1007

2260
01:49:44,576 --> 01:49:45,600
Unemployment

2261
01:49:46,368 --> 01:49:47,904
High Country

2262
01:49:48,416 --> 01:49:52,000
Similar circumstances

2263
01:49:52,256 --> 01:49:55,072
Like three to five percent yet what is recommended by the vet

2264
01:49:55,584 --> 01:49:56,864
13% of Spain's

2265
01:49:57,120 --> 01:49:57,632
Employment isn't

2266
01:49:57,888 --> 01:49:58,912
Construction and housing

2267
01:49:59,424 --> 01:50:03,776
So the 2000s bubble was

2268
01:50:04,032 --> 01:50:05,312
From nearly a decade later

2269
01:50:05,824 --> 01:50:07,104
30% of the housing

2270
01:50:07,616 --> 01:50:08,640
Frey Construction

2271
01:50:08,896 --> 01:50:09,408
You isn't

2272
01:50:10,944 --> 01:50:11,712
It's a very large

2273
01:50:14,016 --> 01:50:18,624
Jesus people of criticize

2274
01:50:18,880 --> 01:50:19,904
Economy was largely

2275
01:50:22,208 --> 01:50:22,720
Possibly

2276
01:50:22,976 --> 01:50:23,488
Yeah

2277
01:50:23,744 --> 01:50:26,048
A country with

2278
01:50:26,304 --> 01:50:27,072
Best protection

2279
01:50:27,328 --> 01:50:27,840
Employees

2280
01:50:28,096 --> 01:50:28,608
In the world

2281
01:50:29,120 --> 01:50:35,264
Until 2012 was the law that if you fired a permanent employee you had to pay them 45 days worth of wages for every year they were

2282
01:50:36,544 --> 01:50:38,336
Naturally this made businesses look for ways to

2283
01:50:38,592 --> 01:50:39,872
To get around have decreed

2284
01:50:43,200 --> 01:50:43,712
Which they did

2285
01:50:44,480 --> 01:50:45,760
Fire hydrant

2286
01:50:46,016 --> 01:50:47,552
Who don't qualify

2287
01:50:47,808 --> 01:50:48,320
For the protection

2288
01:50:51,648 --> 01:50:56,512
An estimate from LTE says that 25% of the workforce is made up of the

2289
01:50:56,768 --> 01:50:57,792
These temporary employees

2290
01:50:58,048 --> 01:51:00,352
Who are not included as employed

2291
01:51:00,608 --> 01:51:05,216
Statistics unemployment rate

2292
01:51:05,472 --> 01:51:05,984
13 or 15

2293
01:51:06,240 --> 01:51:06,752
Percent

2294
01:51:07,264 --> 01:51:11,104
The 10% of that fourteen or fifteen percent is constantly cycling

2295
01:51:17,248 --> 01:51:19,552
Sick because of their temporary status

2296
01:51:19,808 --> 01:51:22,112
Entire month

2297
01:51:22,368 --> 01:51:24,416
X-Pac which explains why

2298
01:51:25,184 --> 01:51:25,696
Play higher

2299
01:51:25,952 --> 01:51:29,280
From this visually look

2300
01:51:31,584 --> 01:51:33,888
Three out of every hundred job contract

2301
01:51:36,960 --> 01:51:37,472
When this article

2302
01:51:37,728 --> 01:51:38,240
That's not good

2303
01:51:38,752 --> 01:51:41,568
Unemployment rate appears to be so high

2304
01:51:42,080 --> 01:51:43,360
Under ideal conditions

2305
01:51:43,616 --> 01:51:46,432
Already and always pretty much consistently higher than you

2306
01:51:46,688 --> 01:51:47,200
Expect

2307
01:51:47,456 --> 01:51:49,760
But now the number is inflated by putting workers into

2308
01:51:50,016 --> 01:51:51,040
Abusive

2309
01:51:51,808 --> 01:51:53,344
It's like Joe with receipt here with the

2310
01:51:53,600 --> 01:51:55,904
Gig economy

2311
01:51:56,672 --> 01:51:58,208
And on a personal level I can attest

2312
01:51:58,464 --> 01:51:59,744
But I was at

2313
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:00,768
2 years before I go

2314
01:52:01,024 --> 01:52:01,536
Complained enough

2315
01:52:01,792 --> 01:52:03,840
But Heather exploiting me that I got high with Max

2316
01:52:07,936 --> 01:52:09,216
Obviously there are other factors.

2317
01:52:09,472 --> 01:52:11,776
Consider but these are a couple of the really big one that Alex

2318
01:52:12,032 --> 01:52:14,848
Conveniently not bringing up what he brings up these flames

2319
01:52:15,360 --> 01:52:18,944
Because if he did they would undercut the idea that the globalist implemented

2320
01:52:19,456 --> 01:52:22,784
Technology plan to take over the economy

2321
01:52:23,040 --> 01:52:23,552
Country because

2322
01:52:23,808 --> 01:52:24,320
That's not

2323
01:52:24,832 --> 01:52:25,344
True

2324
01:52:25,600 --> 01:52:26,880
That isn't what happened

2325
01:52:27,392 --> 01:52:27,904
It just

2326
01:52:28,160 --> 01:52:29,184
Is a wave

2327
01:52:29,440 --> 01:52:30,208
He can interpret

2328
01:52:30,720 --> 01:52:31,232
Statistics

2329
01:52:31,488 --> 01:52:32,768
Even out date

2330
01:52:33,024 --> 01:52:35,328
Yeah but you can interpret these statistics

2331
01:52:35,584 --> 01:52:39,424
And in such a way as to make his argument that it has something to do

2332
01:52:39,680 --> 01:52:41,728
With

2333
01:52:44,032 --> 01:52:44,800
Interpret is almost

2334
01:52:45,568 --> 01:52:48,384
Too bad it like obfuscate

2335
01:52:48,640 --> 01:52:49,920
Statistical fanfiction

2336
01:52:50,432 --> 01:52:51,712
Sorry one last clip year

2337
01:52:52,736 --> 01:52:53,760
It's interesting

2338
01:52:54,016 --> 01:52:56,576
Because on the one hand

2339
01:52:56,832 --> 01:52:57,344
So there is

2340
01:52:59,648 --> 01:53:01,696
But it also

2341
01:53:03,744 --> 01:53:04,512
There's two things that

2342
01:53:04,768 --> 01:53:07,584
They're going on one is Alex's arguing

2343
01:53:07,840 --> 01:53:09,632
Volcanoes are great for play

2344
01:53:09,888 --> 01:53:10,400
True

2345
01:53:10,912 --> 01:53:13,216
Sure you might be making a bigger deal out of it

2346
01:53:13,472 --> 01:53:13,984
Possible

2347
01:53:14,496 --> 01:53:15,264
Second

2348
01:53:15,520 --> 01:53:16,032
He's doing

2349
01:53:16,288 --> 01:53:18,336
Is he seems to be making an argument

2350
01:53:18,592 --> 01:53:21,152
The place is like Venezuela in Africa

2351
01:53:21,408 --> 01:53:24,480
To be based on natural resources

2352
01:53:24,736 --> 01:53:27,808
They should be the countries that are the best

2353
01:53:29,088 --> 01:53:31,648
And the reason that they're not is because they haven't

2354
01:53:31,904 --> 01:53:32,672
Superior culture

2355
01:53:33,952 --> 01:53:34,464
So

2356
01:53:35,488 --> 01:53:38,560
And then stay with the

2357
01:53:45,984 --> 01:53:49,056
Experience or how he's making this argue

2358
01:53:49,312 --> 01:53:51,104
Very much is

2359
01:53:52,640 --> 01:53:53,408
Based in

2360
01:53:53,920 --> 01:53:54,688
Position in a boat

2361
01:53:55,200 --> 01:53:57,760
That there is relative value of cultures

2362
01:53:58,272 --> 01:53:58,784
And

2363
01:53:59,040 --> 01:54:01,088
Central American South American afro

2364
01:54:01,344 --> 01:54:01,856
Working cultures

2365
01:54:03,648 --> 01:54:04,416
Inferior

2366
01:54:04,672 --> 01:54:05,696
2 European

2367
01:54:05,952 --> 01:54:06,720
White culture

2368
01:54:09,792 --> 01:54:10,560
Bright

2369
01:54:10,816 --> 01:54:12,864
Venezuela in Northern

2370
01:54:13,120 --> 01:54:14,144
South America

2371
01:54:20,288 --> 01:54:21,056
The world

2372
01:54:23,872 --> 01:54:24,640
They have

2373
01:54:25,152 --> 01:54:27,712
Incredible Wildlife incredible fish

2374
01:54:29,248 --> 01:54:31,296
Play more resources

2375
01:54:34,880 --> 01:54:35,648
It's joke

2376
01:54:35,904 --> 01:54:36,416
Level

2377
01:54:38,464 --> 01:54:40,512
But just like

2378
01:54:40,768 --> 01:54:42,560
And the government and assistant

2379
01:54:42,816 --> 01:54:43,328
Call Trish

2380
01:54:46,912 --> 01:54:48,960
How many resources

2381
01:54:49,728 --> 01:54:51,008
Sub-Saharan particularly

2382
01:54:55,616 --> 01:54:57,152
The only continent that has

2383
01:55:05,600 --> 01:55:07,136
I want a dinosaur bone

2384
01:55:07,392 --> 01:55:08,160
Summaries

2385
01:55:14,560 --> 01:55:15,328
Lithium

2386
01:55:19,680 --> 01:55:20,704
Every gym

2387
01:55:21,728 --> 01:55:24,288
Farm

2388
01:55:24,800 --> 01:55:26,336
Venezuela

2389
01:55:27,104 --> 01:55:27,616
Volcanic soil

2390
01:55:30,432 --> 01:55:31,968
We sell coffee

2391
01:55:32,736 --> 01:55:34,784
From southern Mexico

2392
01:55:36,320 --> 01:55:38,112
They grow on the sides of volcanoes

2393
01:55:41,440 --> 01:55:42,976
Why did Greece have such good food

2394
01:55:43,488 --> 01:55:44,256
Volcanic soil

2395
01:55:46,304 --> 01:55:47,584
Gary's middle

2396
01:55:49,120 --> 01:55:49,632
Volcano

2397
01:55:51,936 --> 01:55:57,824
The best coffee in the world comes from places you can get really expensive as well

2398
01:55:59,616 --> 01:56:00,896
They've got everything

2399
01:56:01,408 --> 01:56:02,432
Coffee

2400
01:56:02,688 --> 01:56:04,736
From the Continental us because

2401
01:56:05,248 --> 01:56:06,784
We don't have the soil to grow it

2402
01:56:07,040 --> 01:56:08,832
You can grow it it just doesn't taste

2403
01:56:15,488 --> 01:56:17,280
Storybook

2404
01:56:19,328 --> 01:56:21,120
Weird

2405
01:56:21,632 --> 01:56:22,912
Losing the thread

2406
01:56:25,216 --> 01:56:29,568
That's indicative of how his brain works that's really troubling

2407
01:56:30,080 --> 01:56:31,616
Nonpoint

2408
01:56:32,640 --> 01:56:34,176
Sandpoint

2409
01:56:34,944 --> 01:56:35,456
I resist

2410
01:56:37,248 --> 01:56:38,272
Just just like

2411
01:56:38,528 --> 01:56:40,320
For Note 4 no like positive

2412
01:56:40,576 --> 01:56:41,088

Crocheting

2414

Miss generation

2415
01:56:47,232 --> 01:56:48,512
I resisted Mima sighing

2416
01:56:49,280 --> 01:56:49,792
Sure

2417
01:56:50,048 --> 01:56:51,840
But God dammit if that wasn't

2418
01:56:52,096 --> 01:56:56,448
Galaxy brain level s*** right there

2419
01:56:56,704 --> 01:56:57,472
Ice-T it

2420
01:56:57,728 --> 01:57:01,568
All laid out in front of me and none of you guys are all playing on it

2421
01:57:01,824 --> 01:57:03,360
Completely different chest

2422
01:57:03,872 --> 01:57:05,920
I know it all

2423
01:57:06,176 --> 01:57:06,944
Mount Saint Helens

2424
01:57:07,456 --> 01:57:08,480
Is in America

2425
01:57:09,248 --> 01:57:11,040
Campground

2426
01:57:11,296 --> 01:57:11,808
Because

2427
01:57:12,064 --> 01:57:12,576
It erupts

2428
01:57:13,344 --> 01:57:19,232
Unlike some of the ones in Hawaii or active volcanoes of the grow

2429
01:57:19,488 --> 01:57:23,072
Coffee

2430
01:57:23,328 --> 01:57:25,888
They have a nice

2431
01:57:26,144 --> 01:57:27,680
Sexually active

2432
01:57:30,240 --> 01:57:31,008
I mean

2433
01:57:31,264 --> 01:57:32,800
On the one hand I'm not going to

2434
01:57:33,056 --> 01:57:39,200
To deny that volcanic soil is very fertile and good soil not going to argue with that

2435
01:57:39,456 --> 01:57:39,968
But

2436
01:57:40,224 --> 01:57:41,248
I am going to

2437
01:57:41,504 --> 01:57:47,648
Alex got distracted of what was

2438
01:57:48,160 --> 01:57:49,696
A very

2439
01:57:50,208 --> 01:57:52,256
Rerulili racist.

2440
01:57:52,512 --> 01:57:55,584
Ignore the

2441
01:57:55,840 --> 01:57:57,376
Tradition of colonialism

2442
01:57:57,632 --> 01:58:03,776
And especially sub-Saharan Africa

2443
01:58:04,032 --> 01:58:05,056
Really seems to take

2444
01:58:06,080 --> 01:58:07,872
1 elements out of the equation

2445
01:58:09,920 --> 01:58:10,432
And that's

2446
01:58:11,200 --> 01:58:11,968
Bye

2447
01:58:12,736 --> 01:58:14,272
Beyond adjustable Isaac

2448
01:58:14,784 --> 01:58:15,296
Ratably

2449
01:58:17,600 --> 01:58:18,880
Amanda is another word for it

2450
01:58:19,904 --> 01:58:20,416
Shoota lyrics

2451
01:58:22,720 --> 01:58:24,000
I mean undeniably

2452
01:58:24,256 --> 01:58:27,328
If you saying that all these places that's all these resources

2453
01:58:27,584 --> 01:58:30,400
You'll because their cultures they can't get their s*** together

2454
01:58:31,680 --> 01:58:32,192
Wow

2455
01:58:34,752 --> 01:58:37,056
View

2456
01:58:37,824 --> 01:58:39,104
Coming to

2457
01:58:40,128 --> 01:58:41,152
Covington native

2458
01:58:41,408 --> 01:58:42,432
Is coming to North America

2459
01:58:43,456 --> 01:58:44,480
The Savage

2460
01:58:44,992 --> 01:58:48,064
By themselves

2461
01:58:55,232 --> 01:58:57,024
You hear clip like that where he's talking about

2462
01:58:57,280 --> 01:58:57,792
These

2463
01:58:58,048 --> 01:58:58,560
Other

2464
01:58:58,816 --> 01:58:59,584
Africa

2465
01:59:01,120 --> 01:59:03,936
They're mineral-rich

2466
01:59:04,192 --> 01:59:05,984
Cultures

2467
01:59:06,240 --> 01:59:11,104
That's why there's a nefarious element to when he's talking about Africa for the Africans

2468
01:59:11,360 --> 01:59:16,224
Is it that you don't mean retire

2469
01:59:16,736 --> 01:59:20,320
I want all of Africa's resources and I want all of you people

2470
01:59:20,576 --> 01:59:21,088
Yeah

2471
01:59:21,344 --> 01:59:22,112
It's the

2472
01:59:22,624 --> 01:59:23,392
It's a load of b*******

2473
01:59:26,720 --> 01:59:27,232
So what

2474
01:59:29,280 --> 01:59:30,816
I don't think

2475
01:59:31,328 --> 01:59:32,864
Episode is good or very interesting

2476
01:59:33,120 --> 01:59:35,168
It's because like a lot of these things

2477
01:59:35,424 --> 01:59:36,704
Just kind of

2478
01:59:36,960 --> 01:59:37,472
Explicit

2479
01:59:38,496 --> 01:59:39,008
Extensive

2480
01:59:39,264 --> 01:59:40,544
Of things that we've already heard

2481
01:59:40,800 --> 01:59:43,360
Revelation

2482
01:59:44,128 --> 01:59:50,272
We heard you want our thing on a past episode

2483
01:59:52,832 --> 01:59:53,344
Sometimes

2484
01:59:53,600 --> 01:59:58,208
We've already heard him say in the past that Muslims are incompatible with his version of what he wants in

2485
01:59:58,464 --> 02:00:01,792
Society pretty hard here

2486
02:00:02,304 --> 02:00:03,584
We've heard him

2487
02:00:05,632 --> 02:00:07,424
Certipay

2488
02:00:07,680 --> 02:00:09,984
Is ideas about martial law being bad even

2489
02:00:10,240 --> 02:00:11,520
Before

2490
02:00:11,776 --> 02:00:12,800
But he's now being

2491
02:00:13,568 --> 02:00:16,640
So bootlicker read and so enthusiastic about Trump

2492
02:00:16,896 --> 02:00:19,712
Doing that with the Insurrection act in

2493
02:00:19,968 --> 02:00:22,272
Yeah it really is just

2494
02:00:22,528 --> 02:00:23,040
What we

2495
02:00:23,552 --> 02:00:24,320
Do

2496
02:00:24,576 --> 02:00:25,856
Okay alright

2497
02:00:26,112 --> 02:00:28,160
Episode of a television

2498
02:00:28,416 --> 02:00:30,720
Preamble for an action

2499
02:00:31,488 --> 02:00:33,792
Do you know who this is

2500
02:00:34,304 --> 02:00:40,448
Another bottle episode but it's that episode of rising action kind of unsatisfying

2501
02:00:40,704 --> 02:00:41,216
Really a climax

2502
02:00:41,472 --> 02:00:43,776
Next to the building

2503
02:00:44,544 --> 02:00:45,056
In baking

2504
02:00:45,312 --> 02:00:45,824
Intentions were

2505
02:00:46,592 --> 02:00:47,872
I think that's

2506
02:00:49,152 --> 02:00:50,176
In this stretch

2507
02:00:50,432 --> 02:00:51,200
2 time from the 70

2508
02:00:52,736 --> 02:00:53,760
888

2509
02:00:54,016 --> 02:00:54,784
Service

2510
02:00:55,040 --> 02:00:55,808
Of a climax

2511
02:00:56,832 --> 02:00:57,344
Who's coming

2512
02:00:57,600 --> 02:00:59,136
And it worries me

2513
02:00:59,648 --> 02:01:01,184
Well it's

2514
02:01:03,744 --> 02:01:05,280
Repeat it over and over again is one of the

2515
02:01:05,536 --> 02:01:06,560
Isn't that I find Alex

2516
02:01:07,328 --> 02:01:08,864
To be a figure worth talking about

2517
02:01:09,120 --> 02:01:09,632
All

2518
02:01:09,888 --> 02:01:11,424
Is because he is that week

2519
02:01:11,680 --> 02:01:12,704
Glink

2520
02:01:12,960 --> 02:01:15,520
Right-wing propaganda that says

2521
02:01:17,056 --> 02:01:18,848
No he sings allowed part

2522
02:01:20,896 --> 02:01:26,016
The quiet part into the wild

2523
02:01:26,272 --> 02:01:26,784
Excessively

2524
02:01:27,296 --> 02:01:28,064
Done that Alchemy

2525
02:01:28,320 --> 02:01:31,648
I don't know

2526
02:01:31,904 --> 02:01:36,256
Fully if there's a lesson to be learned from this episode

2527
02:01:36,512 --> 02:01:39,328
The present sucks Robinson if

2528
02:01:39,584 --> 02:01:40,096
Fucium

2529
02:01:40,608 --> 02:01:41,632
Milkshake at boy

2530
02:01:41,888 --> 02:01:42,912
Yep

2531
02:01:55,968 --> 02:02:00,832
We are also on the iTune as well as other pods

2532
02:02:01,088 --> 02:02:02,368
Castroville application

2533
02:02:02,880 --> 02:02:03,392
I had a beard

2534
02:02:03,648 --> 02:02:04,160
A mime

2535
02:02:04,672 --> 02:02:05,440
Yes

2536
02:02:12,352 --> 02:02:14,656
The wrong episode 4

2537
02:02:14,912 --> 02:02:15,424
Or somebody

2538
02:02:16,192 --> 02:02:16,704
I don't know

2539
02:02:18,496 --> 02:02:19,008
What do you got

2540
02:02:19,776 --> 02:02:22,848
I mean we didn't talk about it really but

2541
02:02:25,408 --> 02:02:31,552
Jon Ronson hasn't killed anybody 100% looking good

2542
02:02:31,808 --> 02:02:33,600
The terms of what they may or may not have done

2543
02:02:33,856 --> 02:02:39,744
Not murderer

2544
02:02:45,120 --> 02:02:48,704
Alexandra Thurston color with huge fan I love your work
