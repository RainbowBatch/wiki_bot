00:00:16,384 --> 00:00:18,944
Particular

00:00:19,968 --> 00:00:20,992
Showed up to

4
00:00:21,504 --> 00:00:23,808
Who made the recommendation

5
00:00:24,064 --> 00:00:25,600
You're hearing that we had been

00:00:26,112 --> 00:00:32,000
Novelty Inc lesson lagunita thing more

7
00:00:32,256 --> 00:00:33,024
Cherry jeans

8
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:36,096
Sour ale brewed with Turkish delight cherries

9
00:00:36,352 --> 00:00:42,496
The Turkish delight cherries is what really worries me is someone who I grew up when I was growing up

10
00:00:42,752 --> 00:00:46,848
Wardrobe

11
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:49,408
The book so much

12
00:00:49,664 --> 00:00:51,712
Cuz you know my parents were they loves

13
00:00:55,808 --> 00:01:01,952
Is better than one or the other thing

14
00:01:02,208 --> 00:01:04,256
C.s. Lewis

00:01:04,512 --> 00:01:06,816
Stephon Tuitt

16
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:16,032
Turkish Delight in what gets Edward to flip and go with the ice cream sound like

17
00:01:16,288 --> 00:01:17,056
Be amazing

18
00:01:17,312 --> 00:01:19,616
My mom was like I'll make you some

19
00:01:20,384 --> 00:01:22,432
You can make it hard to make Turkish delight

20
00:01:26,016 --> 00:01:26,528
I don't

21
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:30,624
It's sort of like a gelatin

22
00:01:31,136 --> 00:01:31,904
Take a little bit of a

23
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:33,184
Powdered

24
00:01:35,488 --> 00:01:39,072
Like a little treat it's very sweet

25
00:01:39,584 --> 00:01:41,632
The flavors

26
00:01:41,888 --> 00:01:43,936
Legitimately

27
00:01:44,448 --> 00:01:46,752
Same situation except I've never actually

28
00:01:47,008 --> 00:01:47,520
Target store

29
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:49,824
Whenever I found out that

30
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:50,592
Edward

31
00:01:51,872 --> 00:01:54,432
Was willing to sacrifice his entire

32
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:59,808
As well as as well as Aslan

33
00:02:00,064 --> 00:02:02,368
God on this Earth don't forget about toughness

34
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:04,416
Willy's

35
00:02:04,672 --> 00:02:06,208
Right now

36
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:08,768
That's a whole different story but he was willing to give it all up

37
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:11,328
Turkish delight

38
00:02:11,584 --> 00:02:12,608
Sweet

39
00:02:12,864 --> 00:02:15,680
Really really shows the deprivation

40
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:21,824
Hydrate

41
00:02:26,688 --> 00:02:29,504
Terrible

42
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:33,600
But I found it to be really underwhelming

43
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:35,904
I think now is the time for you to take

44
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:44,864
As far as c.s. Lewis goes did you ever get into the other Trilogy that's the one about

45
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:49,216
Like

46
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:50,752
The allegory on

47
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:54,592
Venus I did not read it. Read I read a lot of his other ones about like

48
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:56,128
God

49
00:02:56,896 --> 00:02:59,712
Like a lot of those weird Christian apology book

50
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:06,112
Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah I was really smart when I was like

51
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:08,416
14 reading

52
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:15,072
College k-life L Owen

53
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:16,864
Alright

54
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:19,424
All right you were

55
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:24,288
First I was acting like Alex does

56
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:30,688
Understood remember understand

57
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:33,248
Super thrilled that I understood it like me

58
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,272
Must been like 30

59
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:35,808
You're So reading

60
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:38,112
He's talking about the idea that like when you

61
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:39,392
You see waterfalls

62
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:41,952
You call it the blime

63
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:45,792
If you do something within yourself

64
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:47,584
But that's what you're recognizing

65
00:03:50,144 --> 00:03:51,936
Because I'm not in a great mood but

66
00:03:54,496 --> 00:03:58,336
Maybe it's the same as looking at the waterfall

67
00:03:58,592 --> 00:04:03,456
The opposite not terrible it's not terrible but this is not my style of beer

68
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:04,736
Like the band

69
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:07,808
Necessarily

70
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:11,648
It's not terrible I got

71
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:13,184
Just not my snot my

72
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:15,232
I'll drink it

73
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,559
I understand why someone would like it

74
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:19,839
There is a lot of

75
00:04:20,863 --> 00:04:23,935
Too much Turkish

76
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:24,703
It's like a

77
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:26,751
Whatever you get a Coke

78
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:30,335
And you're like I would like a Cherry Coke in there like we don't have

79
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:32,639
But we'll put a cherry

80
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:34,175
Cherries

81
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:36,735
And then you also put in some

82
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:37,503
Alcohol

83
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:38,271
Like that's what it is

84
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:39,551
Second

85
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:49,535
That'll be positive

86
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:55,935
Emergency episode that's on a Saturday

87
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:57,983
Chaos

88
00:04:58,239 --> 00:04:59,775
Alex Jones

89
00:05:00,287 --> 00:05:01,055
Infowars

90
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:03,103
And this is a rare

91
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:05,663
Where you do know what we're talkin

92
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:11,039
Most news sources

93
00:05:11,295 --> 00:05:14,111
Everybody's kind of miss

94
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:14,879
Sing of the point

95
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:16,159
A little bit I think

96
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:19,743
I don't think we've ever said that about the mainstream media covering

97
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:22,559
Couple articles

98
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:29,983
Nikes

99
00:05:30,495 --> 00:05:32,287
That were like this is bulshit

100
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:37,151
You know like this

101
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:43,807
Too little too late

102
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:46,623
In terms of any kind of puny

103
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:47,391
Is measure against

104
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:53,279
Because Jordan knows I can't imagine anyone not know

105
00:05:56,095 --> 00:05:59,167
Just last week on Thursday and Friday Alex suffered

106
00:06:00,703 --> 00:06:01,727
Meaningless blows

107
00:06:01,983 --> 00:06:03,775
He had on Thursday

108
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:04,799
He had some videos

109
00:06:05,055 --> 00:06:08,127
Taking down from YouTube streaming band

110
00:06:08,383 --> 00:06:10,687
YouTube the song is

111
00:06:14,015 --> 00:06:15,295
Who cares this is like it doesn't

112
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:17,599
Matter good for videos taken down

113
00:06:18,623 --> 00:06:19,135
He wants

114
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:22,719
Emma streaming stuff doesn't really matter

115
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:26,559
Yeah

116
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:31,679
Although I did listen

117
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:32,447
Thursday just

118
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:33,727
A star with a blow-up

119
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:36,287
A little silly but I promise

120
00:06:36,799 --> 00:06:37,567
Realized

121
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:42,943
From this place is going to be so great

122
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:49,087
I got a narrative if you don't give me money now

123
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:53,951
Going to do the job for these people are doing is more or less

124
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:55,743
His hook

125
00:06:56,767 --> 00:06:57,791
Like four people

126
00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:01,631
It's only going to work for people who are already in

127
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:06,239
Tightening the grass

128
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:08,543
He has on people who have already bought his b*******

129
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:10,335
Map to some extent

130
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:12,895
I go back and forth on

131
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:14,943
Whether or not

132
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:15,711
That matter

133
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:16,991
You know like

134
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:19,807
If those people are in your not going to get them

135
00:07:20,063 --> 00:07:21,087
No matter what

136
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:22,111
You do right

137
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:22,879
So

138
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:23,903
I don't know if that's

139
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:25,439
Sara Lee a negative

140
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:27,999
I don't I don't know if you should allow that

141
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:31,583
Facebook YouTube Twitter

142
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:34,143
Play but I don't know but I do know that

143
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:35,935
Doing what they are doing

144
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:36,703
Stupid

145
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:42,335
His financial dealings

146
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:44,895
Thursday

147
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:48,991
We don't need to cover that and I was in a bad mood on Thursday if I didn't

148
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:50,271
I couldn't do it episode

149
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:51,295
And then

150
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:55,903
On Friday last night

151
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:57,183
Facebook

152
00:07:57,695 --> 00:07:59,743
Decided they were going to

153
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:01,535
Everybody's having a good

154
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:02,559
I believe

155
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:04,607
Conviction tell me that it

156
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:05,631
Because they're cowards

157
00:08:07,423 --> 00:08:09,471
YouTube made a move and they're like well this gives up

158
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:10,751
Discover to do something

159
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:17,151
Kicked off Facebook for a month

160
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:19,711
No there's a personal account

161
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:22,271
Play right before we started recording I went on

162
00:08:22,527 --> 00:08:23,551
Infowars

163
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:27,647
Still has a blue checkmark on Facebook so does the Alex Jones

164
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:32,255
Public figure account

165
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:42,751

00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:48,127
F*** off no impact whatsoever

167
00:08:48,383 --> 00:08:49,151
Run those

168
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:51,967
Account through someone else's personal account

169
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:55,807
Or just be like hey Rob do you got a new job for a month

170
00:08:56,063 --> 00:09:01,439
Just run an advertisement saying guess what are the globalist we have no power at all

171
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:04,255
You are now able to advertise off of us

172
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:08,607
Forever we only have an interest in covering our ass

173
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:14,751
PR optic smoo right but it really is advantageous

174
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:16,287
To you and your rhetoric

175
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:20,639
And all that

176
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:27,039
Put that because first exactly

177
00:09:27,295 --> 00:09:30,367
Alex Jones Alex Jones

178
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:36,511
Actually did anything

179
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:37,535
Slightly more money

180
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:43,935
I guess I guess it's kind of almost like they all know that and they're all sort of Plan B

181
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:44,703
Same game

182
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:47,007
Wherever one Hedges their own bat

183
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,823
No one really makes a move

184
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:51,871
The people who get hurt are

185
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:53,151
You know Youmans

186
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:57,503
We are you know the human people write the people who is rhetoric Alex

187
00:09:57,759 --> 00:09:58,527
Actually affect

188
00:09:59,039 --> 00:09:59,551
People who

189
00:10:01,087 --> 00:10:02,111
Things like that

190
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:02,879
People who get hurt

191
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:06,207
I've been a longtime proponent of

192
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:07,743
Don't kick Alex off

193
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:09,791
He's committing a crime

194
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:10,559
Or whatever

195
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:16,447
Financial crimes

196
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:19,775
I don't know it's not my job to figure that out

197
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:21,311
I hate to punch on it

198
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:25,663
Because I should have an opinion but I don't really because I don't run Facebook

199
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:26,687
I don't run YouTube

200
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:28,223
That's not my decision to make

201
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:30,783
And quite frankly if I did run them I would have

202
00:10:31,039 --> 00:10:32,575
Kicked him off long ago

203
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:36,415
It's not a question now should he be kicked off right now we should have been

204
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:43,583
It's even ask the question

205
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:45,631
In the moment

206
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:48,703
It's an absurd question

207
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:52,031
It doesn't reflect reality

208
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:56,895
So I mean did you ask me what I would do in this situation I would say I would never let myself

209
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:57,919
Be in this situation

210
00:10:58,175 --> 00:11:00,735
Warise Facebook or YouTuber

211
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:06,367
You pulled her up from the route you don't snap a little bit of there please

212
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:09,695
And whatever Financial incentive any of those

213
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:12,767
Is dwarfed by other

214
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:14,815
Video game channel

215
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:19,935
Gusting rhetoric

216
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:23,775
You know I mean

217
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:29,919
Text snowflake Zumba 91

218
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:37,087
Glitter just like hey why is stardew Valley great cool

219
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:40,671
Fine

220
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:41,439
To try

221
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:48,095
You know like the weather it's my dear Irish friends or the or the buds

222
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:53,215
Diversionary attack on all of their videos

223
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:54,751
Great

224
00:11:55,775 --> 00:12:00,895
But that idea a couple years before BuzzFeed start.

225
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:01,663
And I pitched

226
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:02,431
Groupon

227
00:12:02,687 --> 00:12:07,039
Back when I work there I will go try all of the Groupon

228
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:07,807
Lisac's

229
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:11,903
Experience and make a YouTube video that it capitalizes on

230
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:14,719
Fear of missing out

231
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:15,487
State

232
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:16,767
Comedian

233
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:19,327
I'll be fun why not do that we'll get a lot of views

234
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:21,631
Free marketing for Groupon

235
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:26,751
More less

236
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:28,031
They're like

237
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:28,799
They're like

238
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:32,127
So I mean

239
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:34,687
My pettiness aside about that those videos

240
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:35,711
Farm

241
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:39,295
Really make sense

242
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:41,343
Stupid

243
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:42,623
Did

244
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:44,671
What you do now with this

245
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:45,695
Facebook

246
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:49,279
Does YouTube penalty all you're doing is

247
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:51,327
Is taking away your own credibility

248
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:52,351
And your own ability

249
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:54,143
Anyway

250
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:55,935
All you're doing is

251
00:12:56,191 --> 00:12:56,703
Making it

252
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:57,727
Very clear

253
00:12:57,983 --> 00:12:59,519
That we will punish you in

254
00:13:00,031 --> 00:13:00,543
Symbolic

255
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:03,359
Wrist slap only

256
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:05,151
And nothing more

257
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:08,479
It's D2 things

258
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:09,247
Some extent

259
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:10,783
For their own

260
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:12,575
Apathetic

261
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:17,183
That's insulting to Kabuki theater

262
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:18,719
So

263
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:19,487
I think this is

264
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:21,279
This is sort of stayed most of my

265
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:22,559
About these

266
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:24,351
YouTube

267
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:25,375
And how like

268
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:26,655
All they really do is

269
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:27,935
Display in Dallas

270
00:13:28,191 --> 00:13:29,983
But the one thing I thought was interest

271
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:32,287
Thing was when I heard

272
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:33,567
Can be banned from streaming

273
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:37,919
That goes through the Ron Gibson

274
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:38,687
Some Channel

275
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:41,247
These are going to do it there

276
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:43,551
So on Thursday I checked him

277
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:45,599
Also

278
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:54,815
And that made me think like maybe they are taking this very seriously and trying to chop off the little tentacles

279
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:56,863
Psycho you're clearly getting around the band

280
00:13:57,631 --> 00:13:58,399
But Ron Gibson

281
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:03,263
Yeah so he just started a second Channel

282
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:06,079
And posted a link

283
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:07,359
In his

284
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:16,575
On Friday

285
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:18,879
Streaming

286
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:21,439
Second Channel

287
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:23,487
So they are taking

288
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:24,511
Kind of seriously what

289
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:25,279
Which is fine

290
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:28,863
But again as we already pointed out he doesn't really have that many people watching

291
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:30,911
Interesting

292
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:33,471
Because his second Channel

293
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:35,263
Ron

294
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:37,311
So he jumped at which

295
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:40,127
Okay on Friday

296
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:41,151
Stream don't

297
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:44,223
But about an hour and a half

298
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:47,807
Which clearly kicked the channel

299
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:51,135
For streaming

300
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:53,183
He's going to end up

301
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:53,951
Probably

302
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:55,231
Gab

303
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:57,023
Or video or so

304
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:03,167
Interesting

305
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:06,495
YouTube was at least

306
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:09,823
He has multiple times

307
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:10,591
Yeah

308
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:12,895
Facebook

309
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:20,831
Infowars actual pages

310
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:22,111
Still up and running

311
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:24,415
The public figure Alex Jones pages

312
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:31,839
All of the Infowars personalities are allowed to go

313
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:33,375
A little bit of the

314
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:34,399
I guess

315
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:36,191
No I don't even think

316
00:15:36,447 --> 00:15:38,495
The convenience of Alex

317
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:40,543
Yeah

318
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:41,823
He's slightly in

319
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:44,127
He has to log into a different

320
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:45,407
Bright that's it

321
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:48,223
This all stems

322
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:49,247
Basically

323
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:51,551
From a couple of videos that

324
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:52,575
Decided

325
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:53,599
Did not

326
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:55,135
Follow their community

327
00:15:56,159 --> 00:15:56,927
And I

328
00:15:57,183 --> 00:15:58,719
Prove that these are

329
00:15:58,975 --> 00:15:59,743
The exact videos

330
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:01,023
Infowars

331
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:02,815
Paul Joseph Watson posted

332
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:05,887
The videos in question

333
00:16:06,655 --> 00:16:07,167
That

334
00:16:08,703 --> 00:16:09,215
The band

335
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:12,287
Yeah therefore videos that got taken down

336
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:13,311
Mysteriously

337
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:14,847
Free on the article that

338
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:16,127
The PJ dubs posted

339
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:17,407
But I guess

340
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:18,943
She's busy and I'm not going to

341
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:19,711
I don't think that's a

342
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:20,735
Conspiracy

343
00:16:20,991 --> 00:16:25,087
But so one of them is Alex being really mad about a cartoon called ragtop

344
00:16:25,343 --> 00:16:27,135
Which is not really it's not really for kids

345
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:31,231
As part of RuPaul's Drag Race

346
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:35,071
It's like that band for a video about

347
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:37,375
He's correct,

348
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:40,959
Children

349
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:45,567
Right

350
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:47,359
I really just

351
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:49,407
To me I look at it

352
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:50,175
Sturtevant

353
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:52,223
This is like My Little Pony the new one

354
00:16:57,343 --> 00:16:58,111
Dido

355
00:16:59,135 --> 00:16:59,903
It's not for me but

356
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:04,767
It is what it is

357
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:05,791
Valances

358
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:07,583
Anti crossdresser anti-trans

359
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:08,863
Content

360
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:12,703
It really doesn't even

361
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:15,007
So drag tots

362
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:16,543
Was there a Line in the Sand

363
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:21,919
Not all of the other s*** I can come up with

364
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:22,943
The video dead

365
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:24,991
Territory

366
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:26,271
Because he does run footage

367
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:27,039
Do children

368
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:28,063
From a show

369
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:31,647
About kids who like to cross-dress probably some

370
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:38,303
Documentary series

371
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:39,071
Maybe

372
00:17:39,327 --> 00:17:44,959
I don't know I have no f****** idea

373
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:46,751
Identify

374
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:49,567
You know they were on that show

375
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:51,103
It shows their names

376
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:51,871
Stop

377
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:53,151
He's running the

378
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:54,431
Did she does get into

379
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:55,199
Like

380
00:17:55,455 --> 00:17:56,479
His gross pedophile

381
00:17:56,735 --> 00:17:59,295
Demon Rancic

382
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:00,319
I could

383
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:02,367
Stupid people watching it

384
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:04,159
Identifying the people who are on

385
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:04,927
Screen

386
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:05,695
Is being

387
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:07,487
As evil as Alex's

388
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:08,255
Screaming about

389
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:12,351
It's really nothing different than I've seen him do

390
00:18:12,607 --> 00:18:15,679
Many times before

391
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:16,447
It is

392
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:19,263
He said we've been talking

393
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:21,311
For 10 years

394
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:26,175
Yeah Boy last night from from 2000s

395
00:18:26,431 --> 00:18:31,295
What is Extreme it's definitely more of a focus

396
00:18:32,575 --> 00:18:33,855
That's probably just be

397
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:35,135
Because it caught fire on the

398
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:40,511
Video is clearly over a month old

399
00:18:41,023 --> 00:18:41,535
Shaving

400
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:45,631
And all it is is Alex talking about Muslims taking over Europe

401
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:47,679
He's commenting on a video of a

402
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:48,703
Emmanuel macron

403
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:50,751
Speech

404
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:53,823
Something really different from his normal stick but

405
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:57,919
He does say that after Muslims take over Europe they're going to blow up the planet

406
00:18:58,175 --> 00:19:00,479
Those ones are going to kill the entire world

407
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:02,783
It's cruel it's manipulative and

408
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:03,807
Deeply bigoted

409
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:07,135
But

410
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:07,903
The past

411
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:10,975
So I don't care about that I don't

412
00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:15,583
What's up just they're just going to take over the world and then blow it up or they're going to blow it up in the

413
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:19,167
The implication that he makes them

414
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:25,823
New is bit whenever Muslims get in charge of something with everybody

415
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:27,871
Because they're somehow

416
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:30,943
I don't know genetically incapable of peace

417
00:19:31,199 --> 00:19:33,247
Weird

418
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:36,831
Horrifying

419
00:19:37,087 --> 00:19:38,111
Disgusting

420
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:44,767
Not out of line with Infowars regular content

421
00:19:45,023 --> 00:19:49,375
Absolutely nothing

422
00:19:49,631 --> 00:19:52,191
Were they just stolen somebody else's viral video

423
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:55,007
Little kid flexing on a grown man

424
00:19:55,263 --> 00:19:58,335
Right around with him for a little bit

425
00:19:58,591 --> 00:20:01,663
About after about 20 seconds kids start hitting the guy

426
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:04,735
Another guy grabbed the kid by the neck and throw them to the

427
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:07,551
The kid starts wailing

428
00:20:08,063 --> 00:20:08,831
I'm not either

429
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:13,439
It's weird and they're playing it with some weird music behind it but

430
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:20,095
The Highwaymen Silver Stallion I could see an argument that this would be seen as child and

431
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:23,935
But only because the video is titled how to prevent liberalism

432
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:28,287
Which Wich

433
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:32,383
It implies in some way that the guy is standing up to the aggressive

434
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:33,407
The child that represent

435
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:34,175
Liberals

436
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:37,759
I think what gets in fours Off The Hook from my position

437
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:42,111
Is it the very endearing mcbreen comes in doing the voiceover and says quote

438
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:43,647
Prevent liberalism used

439
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:44,415
Condoms

440
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:45,439
Which makes

441
00:20:45,695 --> 00:20:46,463
Dosa

442
00:20:47,487 --> 00:20:48,511
Zero cents

443
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:51,839
I know it's comedy I know it's an attempt at comedy

444
00:20:52,095 --> 00:20:54,911
I was going to say you you saying that it was

445
00:20:55,423 --> 00:20:59,775
Very generous

446
00:21:00,031 --> 00:21:03,359
If you use condoms and I kid wouldn't be there maybe

447
00:21:03,615 --> 00:21:06,943
But that guy clearly wasn't the kids. So that makes no sense

448
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:08,991
Is the implication that unsafe sex

449
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:11,807
Create liberals

450
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:12,575
Because

451
00:21:14,111 --> 00:21:16,159
It's clearly a bulshit attempt at being funny

452
00:21:16,672 --> 00:21:17,696
I give this a pass

453
00:21:17,952 --> 00:21:20,768
In terms of like why you would ever Center their channel for it

454
00:21:21,024 --> 00:21:24,096
I understand if you are writing person YouTube

455
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:25,888
A video titled how to

456
00:21:26,144 --> 00:21:29,216
Prevent liberalism and then a grown person assaulting a buck

457
00:21:29,472 --> 00:21:33,568
Child how to make

458
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:36,896
Conservatives are grown men fighting children

459
00:21:37,152 --> 00:21:37,920
I think

460
00:21:38,176 --> 00:21:40,224
Early reports on it might have

461
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:44,064
If implied that Alex was the adult in that video

462
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:47,136
What

463
00:21:47,392 --> 00:21:47,904
Make that

464
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:48,672
Mistake is

465
00:21:48,928 --> 00:21:49,440
Is that

466
00:21:49,952 --> 00:21:50,976
Alex and that guy have

467
00:21:51,232 --> 00:21:52,256
Oh that really shity beer

468
00:21:52,512 --> 00:21:58,656
Only persons

469
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:00,960
The only actors

470
00:22:01,216 --> 00:22:01,728
Could get to

471
00:22:01,984 --> 00:22:03,008
To really pull that off

472
00:22:08,384 --> 00:22:09,408
Was it him

473
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:10,688
It was not did he say

474
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:13,504
Dial not liberal

475
00:22:14,528 --> 00:22:17,600
No it wasn't that I don't know the only reason that I think

476
00:22:17,856 --> 00:22:18,624
There might be some

477
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:20,416
Claims

478
00:22:20,928 --> 00:22:21,952
The people said it was him

479
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,488
Is it

480
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,536
Antarctica

481
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:27,328
Probably head of Correction

482
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:28,864
That's it

483
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:31,168
Initially reported Alex

484
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:33,216
In the video

485
00:22:33,472 --> 00:22:39,616
No one else that he could be other than the guy who stuck in throat

486
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:40,384
Everyone

487
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,664
Covering Alex Jones

488
00:22:42,176 --> 00:22:43,712
Because if you're covering him

489
00:22:46,784 --> 00:22:49,856
I don't know if they're the most reputable biggest name in news

490
00:22:50,368 --> 00:22:52,672
But if you are in any way cover

491
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,232
And you miss report

492
00:22:55,488 --> 00:22:58,048
That he is the person assaulting that child

493
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:02,144
Even if you immediately make a correction you have just given him

494
00:23:02,912 --> 00:23:03,936
The greatest gift

495
00:23:04,192 --> 00:23:04,960
Could ever give yeah

496
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:06,240
You have to play

497
00:23:06,496 --> 00:23:07,264
Very tight

498
00:23:08,032 --> 00:23:08,544
These people

499
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:09,312
Because

500
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,360
Make a mountain

501
00:23:11,616 --> 00:23:15,200
You make about them is going

502
00:23:15,712 --> 00:23:16,480
He played for Sasha

503
00:23:17,504 --> 00:23:18,016
For them

504
00:23:18,784 --> 00:23:20,320
So anyway

505
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:24,416
I've been up being kicked off for videos that incite bigotry

506
00:23:24,928 --> 00:23:25,440
No s***

507
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:26,976
But he does that all the time

508
00:23:27,488 --> 00:23:28,000
If you're going to

509
00:23:28,256 --> 00:23:29,792
If you're going to make that a serious

510
00:23:30,048 --> 00:23:30,816
Complaint your levying

511
00:23:31,328 --> 00:23:32,352
Go through all of it

512
00:23:32,864 --> 00:23:36,704
Give him strikes were all that throw him off your f****** platform forever

513
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,520
Reply

514
00:23:39,776 --> 00:23:40,544
There to everyone

515
00:23:41,312 --> 00:23:41,824
Denver

516
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:46,176
What is giving me pain

517
00:23:47,456 --> 00:23:47,968
Yep

518
00:23:48,224 --> 00:23:48,736
Further

519
00:23:49,248 --> 00:23:50,784
I have heard the the

520
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:52,064
The statement date

521
00:23:52,576 --> 00:23:54,112
Is being charged

522
00:23:55,648 --> 00:23:56,416
Is a child endangerment

523
00:23:56,672 --> 00:23:57,184
Because of that video

524
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,232
DHHR

525
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:01,024
Peace was never that he was the person

526
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:01,792
Making the video

527
00:24:02,048 --> 00:24:05,888
Yeah he's make it you will later in this episode

528
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:07,424
Make it seem like that

529
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,448
People

530
00:24:08,704 --> 00:24:10,240
It's more

531
00:24:10,496 --> 00:24:11,008
That

532
00:24:11,264 --> 00:24:13,312
The child endangerment affect comes from

533
00:24:13,824 --> 00:24:14,848
Him presenting

534
00:24:15,104 --> 00:24:16,896
This guy assaulting a child is sort of

535
00:24:17,152 --> 00:24:17,664
Positive

536
00:24:18,176 --> 00:24:21,504
Which is not good and that seems to be his

537
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:23,552
Main goal in life

538
00:24:25,856 --> 00:24:28,416
First video about the

539
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:29,440
Where are you getting it

540
00:24:29,696 --> 00:24:30,976
Really dicey territory

541
00:24:31,488 --> 00:24:32,256
Where he's doing his

542
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:37,376
Is demon screaming over actual children could put them in a position where

543
00:24:37,632 --> 00:24:38,144
1 mi

544
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,704
I don't know if that

545
00:24:41,472 --> 00:24:45,056
Based on all of these social media places actions in the past

546
00:24:45,312 --> 00:24:45,824
Maritz

547
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:46,592
Kicking him off

548
00:24:47,104 --> 00:24:48,640
But I mean I get the argument

549
00:24:49,408 --> 00:24:50,688
And if you don't not up

550
00:24:50,944 --> 00:24:52,224
Just actually kick him off

551
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,504
Then just stop

552
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:54,528
Yourself

553
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:58,624
All this is nothing daddy shooting people

554
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,416
Provider the house

555
00:25:00,672 --> 00:25:01,952
Sweet

556
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,560
That's brutal

557
00:25:06,816 --> 00:25:12,192
Chokeslam official video that they made

558
00:25:12,448 --> 00:25:15,008
It's not like they grabbed

559
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:21,408
Specifically

560
00:25:21,664 --> 00:25:23,712
Produce that they didn't write

561
00:25:23,968 --> 00:25:24,736
They didn't do anything

562
00:25:24,992 --> 00:25:25,504
Nope

563
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:26,272
They stole it

564
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,160
Copyright issues

565
00:25:32,416 --> 00:25:33,440
I don't know if

566
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:40,352
27th episode

567
00:25:40,608 --> 00:25:41,120
Things about Alex

568
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,168
Play satellites

569
00:25:43,424 --> 00:25:44,704
All the drama

570
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:45,728
All of the

571
00:25:45,984 --> 00:25:47,008
Articles that missed the

572
00:25:47,264 --> 00:25:47,776
The point

573
00:25:49,312 --> 00:25:51,616
Define on the 27th of probably Alex screaming

574
00:25:51,872 --> 00:25:52,640
I probably didn't like

575
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:55,712
The globalist are afoot they're going to take us

576
00:25:58,528 --> 00:25:59,552
What I'm more expected

577
00:26:01,856 --> 00:26:03,648
Over the course of this episode

578
00:26:04,672 --> 00:26:05,952
You'll see exactly what I mean

579
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:06,976
I don't want to tip my hand

580
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:08,000
Too much but

581
00:26:09,792 --> 00:26:10,304
Alex

582
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,840
There's not a contacts dropped from Today Show

583
00:26:15,424 --> 00:26:17,216

584
00:26:17,984 --> 00:26:19,776
Just for

585
00:26:20,032 --> 00:26:20,800
N-word

586
00:26:21,056 --> 00:26:24,384
I had the videotape but Alex

587
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:34,624
Also I want to do this real quick I'm sorry we had that bad that bit of a 25-minute intro

588
00:26:38,976 --> 00:26:43,584
I don't know

589
00:26:45,632 --> 00:26:46,400
You don't believe

590
00:26:46,656 --> 00:26:48,192
That's my boy

591
00:26:49,728 --> 00:26:52,032
Shout out to

592
00:26:59,200 --> 00:26:59,712

Thank you so much thank you so much for joining up skiba

594
00:27:07,648 --> 00:27:10,464
Acknowledge

595
00:27:21,472 --> 00:27:24,288
We jumping Today Show the first 5 minutes of the show

596
00:27:24,544 --> 00:27:26,592
Because Alex operates is

597
00:27:27,104 --> 00:27:27,616
5 minutes

598
00:27:28,128 --> 00:27:30,176
Is optional on what station

599
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:35,808
Because a lot of them do news at the top of the hour

600
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:36,832
Great songs

601
00:27:37,088 --> 00:27:38,880
No not at all not at all

602
00:27:40,928 --> 00:27:41,696
The songs are just

603
00:27:43,488 --> 00:27:49,632
I can tell you that's random on the clock that's just because he really have

604
00:27:53,728 --> 00:27:57,056
Now because he has this clock that he operates off of

605
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:58,848
The first 5 minutes

606
00:27:59,104 --> 00:27:59,872
The show will be him

607
00:28:00,896 --> 00:28:02,944
Doing the best of what's to come

608
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:06,016
Imagine if John bowne has a new video out

609
00:28:06,272 --> 00:28:08,064
Hilde Foothill Place

610
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:08,832
And then coming

611
00:28:09,088 --> 00:28:09,856
6 minutes later

612
00:28:10,112 --> 00:28:12,160
Today's episode Mark Dice

613
00:28:12,928 --> 00:28:14,720
Is doing that doing a little bit of

614
00:28:15,232 --> 00:28:16,256
Little Mike Tyson business

615
00:28:18,048 --> 00:28:20,864
Hey how you doing

616
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:24,448
It shouldn't be but so Mark a lot of his videos are him

617
00:28:24,704 --> 00:28:25,984
Doing really bad man I'm just

618
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,008
Street

619
00:28:29,056 --> 00:28:30,848
I know I know where

620
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:33,920
Who is it how is your nose

621
00:28:34,432 --> 00:28:34,944
I mean

622
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:37,504
I mean like I know we've been over this 10 million

623
00:28:38,272 --> 00:28:38,784
And I know it's

624
00:28:41,088 --> 00:28:41,600
Looking if you

625
00:28:41,856 --> 00:28:42,624
You're going to go after

626
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:43,648
Alex Jones

627
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,696
Why isn't Mike cernovich also

628
00:28:48,256 --> 00:28:49,024
Pile of garbage

629
00:28:49,536 --> 00:28:50,048
Is

630
00:28:50,304 --> 00:28:51,328
At this point

631
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:56,704
Bradley or least Morris

632
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:01,824
Like what else

633
00:29:03,872 --> 00:29:04,384
She's kind of like

634
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,432
She knows his brand really well

635
00:29:06,944 --> 00:29:10,784
And he's not going to go after somebody that people will like really stand up

636
00:29:11,552 --> 00:29:15,904
You're not okay

637
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:17,952
Like with this James Gunn business

638
00:29:18,208 --> 00:29:19,744
He's so much like people

639
00:29:22,048 --> 00:29:22,816
Yeah that's

640
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:24,352
Sucked up

641
00:29:24,608 --> 00:29:25,120
Like what

642
00:29:25,376 --> 00:29:27,424
Posted with really sucked up stuff

643
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:28,960
I know it is a joke

644
00:29:29,216 --> 00:29:29,984
You shouldn't be

645
00:29:30,496 --> 00:29:31,776
How to task for that but

646
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:35,104
I'm not going to waste my energy on this one

647
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:39,456
He knows to do that he overslept level of like

648
00:29:39,968 --> 00:29:40,736
Really dude

649
00:29:40,992 --> 00:29:44,064
All the problems that we're going to go eat

650
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,856
Tops of the list

651
00:29:46,112 --> 00:29:50,464
Other s*** overextended himself when he tried to

652
00:29:50,976 --> 00:29:51,744
Represent those fraudulent

653
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,024
Documents

654
00:29:53,536 --> 00:29:54,048
Yeah that's true

655
00:29:54,304 --> 00:29:56,096
He did that

656
00:29:59,168 --> 00:30:05,312
This is the level of pain we can pull off

657
00:30:09,408 --> 00:30:09,920
So instead

658
00:30:10,176 --> 00:30:11,200
Mike cernovich is just

659
00:30:11,456 --> 00:30:11,968
Duke

660
00:30:13,504 --> 00:30:14,784
He's just a little a******

661
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:16,832
Who puts out his periscope

662
00:30:17,088 --> 00:30:20,160
And then he spends all his time or his minions

663
00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:21,440
I do it for you

664
00:30:21,696 --> 00:30:24,512
Going through celebrities that they don't like Twitter

665
00:30:24,768 --> 00:30:26,816
I'm trying to find things to be like

666
00:30:27,072 --> 00:30:30,912
Like him and Laura Loomer were complaining about Patton Oswalt putting up a bunch of tweets

667
00:30:31,168 --> 00:30:33,728
Find that we're like the Nazis were right

668
00:30:36,032 --> 00:30:39,360
The contacts did not like it was the second tweet Nusrat or some

669
00:30:39,616 --> 00:30:45,760
Unfortunately cut off at exactly

670
00:30:47,552 --> 00:30:48,064
Edward like

671
00:30:49,088 --> 00:30:50,112
This guy was in red

672
00:30:58,816 --> 00:30:59,840
Composition of the ad say

673
00:31:00,096 --> 00:31:00,864
You'll know

674
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,912
Interest in what reality is you just want

675
00:31:03,168 --> 00:31:03,680
Score points in

676
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:08,288
Exactly. And they're like

677
00:31:13,664 --> 00:31:15,456
So do you question why don't we deal with it

678
00:31:16,224 --> 00:31:18,016
Because I am not that

679
00:31:18,784 --> 00:31:19,552
I'm.

680
00:31:19,808 --> 00:31:22,624
The two I know I mean like I understand

681
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:24,928
Probably

682
00:31:25,184 --> 00:31:26,208
In the same position of life

683
00:31:27,488 --> 00:31:28,256
He's going to run out of

684
00:31:28,768 --> 00:31:30,304
I think even the right

685
00:31:30,816 --> 00:31:32,864
Missy's through a little bit

686
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:35,680
Idaho

687
00:31:35,936 --> 00:31:42,080
Like you doesn't have much of an adult

688
00:31:42,592 --> 00:31:43,360
4 people showed up

689
00:31:43,616 --> 00:31:45,408
That's like most

690
00:31:45,664 --> 00:31:47,968
Reporters aren't real people

691
00:31:50,272 --> 00:31:51,552
Just as people who are

692
00:31:52,064 --> 00:31:55,904
Yeah

693
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:56,928
Your point I don't

694
00:31:57,184 --> 00:32:01,024
Mickey shows up much anymore on it Alex's show

695
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:03,584
Falling out after that breaks

696
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:08,960
So I have a good first album and then you get the stuff

697
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:17,152
He's never had a good first album is Mark so he starts off

698
00:32:17,408 --> 00:32:20,736
Doing this video where he's making fun of how Anderson Cooper

699
00:32:20,992 --> 00:32:24,320
Ncnm decided to start Facebook live stream

700
00:32:24,832 --> 00:32:27,648
Apparently there's a cop putting out

701
00:32:29,184 --> 00:32:29,696
On Facebook

702
00:32:34,304 --> 00:32:35,328
Creator on Facebook

703
00:32:35,584 --> 00:32:38,912
Can point out to the point where this

704
00:32:39,168 --> 00:32:39,680
Makes no sense

705
00:32:40,704 --> 00:32:43,008
Joined by Jim Acosta

706
00:33:04,768 --> 00:33:05,280
Interactive

707
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:15,008
So two times and 30 seconds points out how do viewers they have

708
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:18,336
Just we know I watch Alex's livestreams all the time

709
00:33:19,872 --> 00:33:21,408
If that you know like it's not

710
00:33:21,664 --> 00:33:24,736
This is this is a really bizarre line

711
00:33:24,992 --> 00:33:26,272
In terms of like humiliating

712
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:29,600
Something like that also with his voice shouldn't

713
00:33:30,624 --> 00:33:31,648
A green suit

714
00:33:31,904 --> 00:33:35,232
With dollars.

715
00:33:36,768 --> 00:33:38,560
Free money from the government

716
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:44,960
He is doing a real f*****-up like if you see him on the street

717
00:33:47,264 --> 00:33:51,616
That's the only thing I can guess play

718
00:33:51,872 --> 00:33:58,016
Operating principles going on

719
00:33:58,528 --> 00:33:59,296
Making fun of

720
00:33:59,552 --> 00:34:00,320
Because they believe

721
00:34:00,576 --> 00:34:01,600
Maybe the right

722
00:34:01,856 --> 00:34:04,160
Behind

723
00:34:07,232 --> 00:34:12,096
Kicked off of Facebook this wrist slap minor punitive measure

724
00:34:12,352 --> 00:34:12,864
CNN

725
00:34:13,376 --> 00:34:17,216
What is Brian stelter do pieces about like

726
00:34:18,496 --> 00:34:22,336
Why is nobody

727
00:34:22,848 --> 00:34:24,640
But who knows if we actually

728
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:26,176
Had anything to do with it

729
00:34:26,432 --> 00:34:27,456
Imagine a better

730
00:34:29,504 --> 00:34:30,272
But who knows

731
00:34:30,528 --> 00:34:31,040
Mark Dice

732
00:34:31,552 --> 00:34:34,624
Terrible not going hard

733
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:38,464
He's going to hard and doesn't realize that he has

734
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:41,280
Nothing like he's a guy who's like you know what

735
00:34:43,072 --> 00:34:44,352
I'm really going through

736
00:34:44,608 --> 00:34:46,144
Disable

737
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,680
74 miles

738
00:34:48,192 --> 00:34:52,032
Crazy commercial break

739
00:34:52,288 --> 00:34:53,568
After that for Alex

740
00:34:53,824 --> 00:34:57,408
Commercial

741
00:35:04,832 --> 00:35:10,976
$3

742
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:18,144
So I mean they play variation

743
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:21,472
That same commercial a couple times it's is Rodger Stone straight up

744
00:35:21,984 --> 00:35:23,776
If you don't want to buy our

745
00:35:24,032 --> 00:35:26,336
Bulshit

746
00:35:26,592 --> 00:35:29,920
How about you give us money so we don't even have any overhead on

747
00:35:30,176 --> 00:35:31,200
Taking that money

748
00:35:31,456 --> 00:35:34,016
Great deal

749
00:35:34,272 --> 00:35:37,600
Yeah probably

750
00:35:41,952 --> 00:35:42,720
S*** like that

751
00:35:44,256 --> 00:35:44,768
It's very different

752
00:35:45,024 --> 00:35:46,048
It feels weird

753
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:48,608
Reno

754
00:35:49,632 --> 00:35:51,168
And I don't I don't know if

755
00:35:51,424 --> 00:35:51,936
Depict

756
00:35:52,704 --> 00:35:55,008
Actual desperation or just

757
00:35:55,264 --> 00:35:55,776
I'm sick of this

758
00:35:57,312 --> 00:36:02,432
Sales are down on my supplements do need somebody coming in to look good like we can't

759
00:36:02,688 --> 00:36:08,832
If we have no money coming in and our numbers are dropping whoever is bankrolling the operation is going to be like yeah

760
00:36:09,088 --> 00:36:12,672
I pay you

761
00:36:12,928 --> 00:36:14,208
To spout these narrative

762
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:19,840
Because of the people listening to you ain't even even more like

763
00:36:20,096 --> 00:36:22,656
It's like a laundromat

764
00:36:23,168 --> 00:36:25,216
Through a carwash that literally

765
00:36:25,472 --> 00:36:27,008
No one ever goes to

766
00:36:27,264 --> 00:36:33,408
You're like this is a little bit to suspicion has no listeners and somehow he still got a $3000000

767
00:36:33,664 --> 00:36:39,808
Studio The Jig Is up a little bit

768
00:36:40,064 --> 00:36:41,088
But investigators will be like

769
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,976
Reported a profit of -1000000 dollars

770
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:49,792
Very strange

771
00:36:50,816 --> 00:36:52,352
So there's another commercial

772
00:36:53,632 --> 00:36:55,936
There's another commercial that gets played

773
00:36:57,728 --> 00:36:58,240
Strong

774
00:36:58,496 --> 00:36:59,264
Glimpse

775
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,288
Where

776
00:37:00,544 --> 00:37:01,056
Alex

777
00:37:01,312 --> 00:37:01,824
Forest

778
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:09,504
Infowars with you wherever you go well now you can do just that

779
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:15,648
The best part

780
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,440
So they're pushing the app

781
00:37:17,696 --> 00:37:22,304
Commercials for that all too regularly

782
00:37:23,072 --> 00:37:24,608
I think they have but it's been like a real piece of

783
00:37:24,864 --> 00:37:25,632
The s*** like a real

784
00:37:25,888 --> 00:37:26,912
Betacap

785
00:37:27,168 --> 00:37:32,288
Yeah I think they might have got it redesigned or something like that but I think that they're starting to realize that like

786
00:37:33,312 --> 00:37:34,080
You know what

787
00:37:34,592 --> 00:37:35,616
They're started like

788
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:39,200
YouTube and Facebook are starting to give us slaps on the wrist

789
00:37:39,456 --> 00:37:43,296
We can't afford to change our Behavior

790
00:37:46,624 --> 00:37:51,744
That's a gamble could just get kicked off the App Store

791
00:37:54,304 --> 00:37:57,376
I've everyone else started to make moves like real

792
00:37:57,632 --> 00:38:03,776
Stickley tour

793
00:38:04,032 --> 00:38:04,544
Marron

794
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:05,312
Places

795
00:38:05,568 --> 00:38:06,592
Which cab was an attempt

796
00:38:06,848 --> 00:38:07,360
To do

797
00:38:07,616 --> 00:38:08,896
That didn't work right

798
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:16,320
They're just so loud

799
00:38:16,576 --> 00:38:17,344
People who

800
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:18,112
Go

801
00:38:18,368 --> 00:38:19,136
This way

802
00:38:20,928 --> 00:38:22,208
But the problem is

803
00:38:22,464 --> 00:38:25,280
You create those spaces that are specially tailored for

804
00:38:25,792 --> 00:38:26,816
This world

805
00:38:27,072 --> 00:38:30,656
What you end up with is all of those loud

806
00:38:30,912 --> 00:38:32,192
Were there not restrain from

807
00:38:32,448 --> 00:38:33,216
Saying Nazi s***

808
00:38:33,472 --> 00:38:36,288
You're not restrain from Edwards around North races

809
00:38:36,544 --> 00:38:38,848
Like it's sort of a gentleman speak freely

810
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:43,712
And all the normal people are like

811
00:38:48,064 --> 00:38:48,576
Damn

812
00:38:48,832 --> 00:38:52,160
Either that or they don't agree with that and they're like

813
00:38:53,696 --> 00:38:55,744
Look I still agree with Infowars

814
00:38:56,512 --> 00:39:00,864
Dissociate

815
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:01,888
That being what it's

816
00:39:02,144 --> 00:39:02,656
It's really about

817
00:39:03,168 --> 00:39:04,960
And what they think it's real

818
00:39:05,472 --> 00:39:07,776
Right and so anytime these like

819
00:39:08,544 --> 00:39:09,824
Niche communities

820
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,872
Get started up as a end up drifting

821
00:39:12,128 --> 00:39:12,896
Towards the fact

822
00:39:13,408 --> 00:39:14,944
Drifting towards the big

823
00:39:15,456 --> 00:39:15,968
Cuz that's

824
00:39:16,992 --> 00:39:17,760
What is about

825
00:39:18,016 --> 00:39:18,528
So

826
00:39:19,296 --> 00:39:20,832
It's an unsustainable Market

827
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:27,744
You can't grow unless more people become bigoted or more people are like

828
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:31,328
What's a

829
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:33,120
In terms of the Infowars audience

830
00:39:33,632 --> 00:39:36,704
25% monsters 75%

831
00:39:38,496 --> 00:39:40,032
Stupid or trick

832
00:39:40,288 --> 00:39:41,824
Or whatever or people watching

833
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:45,152
For entertainment value

834
00:39:45,408 --> 00:39:47,712
Once you get them all in the same place in

835
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:49,504
Not on Twitter where they're

836
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:50,528
Fighting against

837
00:39:50,784 --> 00:39:52,064
Quitter you can sort of

838
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:55,392
Have a lot of issues get put to the back burner when you're fighting

839
00:39:55,648 --> 00:39:58,208
The system the system

840
00:39:58,464 --> 00:40:03,584
And you're like oh all of my fellow compatriots really just want to drop 1488 references right

841
00:40:04,864 --> 00:40:08,448
I don't know about this anymore

842
00:40:08,704 --> 00:40:09,728
Mostly going to leave

843
00:40:09,984 --> 00:40:13,056
You're going to end up with maybe that 25 + 5

844
00:40:13,312 --> 00:40:18,176
Percent 10% to get shifted gets flipped over that you left with nothing

845
00:40:19,712 --> 00:40:20,736
Are so cancerous

846
00:40:20,992 --> 00:40:25,600
Let no one has any entry point to it

847
00:40:26,624 --> 00:40:29,696
Because of all the people that they push it

848
00:40:29,952 --> 00:40:31,488
The only way to play Both Sides

849
00:40:31,744 --> 00:40:33,024
Greece

850
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:34,048
But they're not

851
00:40:34,304 --> 00:40:36,864
They're not comfortable like throw in the end

852
00:40:39,424 --> 00:40:44,032
I definitely want black people to be slaves but I don't want to say the n-word anymore that's a

853
00:40:44,288 --> 00:40:46,848
You can't you can't make it to overt

854
00:40:47,104 --> 00:40:47,616
Without

855
00:40:47,872 --> 00:40:48,640
Alienating

856
00:40:50,688 --> 00:40:52,480
Because that's

857
00:40:52,736 --> 00:40:54,784
For these people

858
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:55,808
Then

859
00:40:56,064 --> 00:40:56,576
Student Connect

860
00:40:56,832 --> 00:40:58,880
The ideas that they're throwing around

861
00:40:59,648 --> 00:41:02,208
Why is it that I agree 100%

862
00:41:02,464 --> 00:41:04,512
With people who are happily throwing the end

863
00:41:05,024 --> 00:41:06,048
Right

864
00:41:06,304 --> 00:41:09,376
Seem like it reflects well on me

865
00:41:09,632 --> 00:41:10,144
And then I

866
00:41:11,936 --> 00:41:14,752
Without feeling bad about

867
00:41:15,008 --> 00:41:16,288
Subway

868
00:41:16,544 --> 00:41:18,336
But I also think the more important point is

869
00:41:18,592 --> 00:41:20,128
Is this is the truth behind

870
00:41:21,152 --> 00:41:22,688
Argument

871
00:41:22,944 --> 00:41:23,968
The people like Alex

872
00:41:24,224 --> 00:41:24,736
People like

873
00:41:24,992 --> 00:41:25,760
Most of his gas

874
00:41:26,528 --> 00:41:27,040
And co-host

875
00:41:27,296 --> 00:41:30,368
About the idea that Twitter Facebook are monopolies

876
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:33,184
On social

877
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:33,952
Square

878
00:41:34,976 --> 00:41:36,256
Square of modern times

879
00:41:39,328 --> 00:41:40,096
Go talk to your friend

880
00:41:42,144 --> 00:41:43,680
If you think

881
00:41:43,936 --> 00:41:49,056
End all of public discourse

882
00:41:49,312 --> 00:41:55,455
Then I'm afraid that that says more about you than it does about public discourse

883
00:41:55,711 --> 00:41:58,271
Publix

884
00:41:58,783 --> 00:41:59,295
Just be

885
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:02,367
It's not because other things heaven

886
00:42:02,623 --> 00:42:03,135
Tried

887
00:42:03,391 --> 00:42:04,927
It's that other things have fun

888
00:42:05,183 --> 00:42:05,695
Fail

889
00:42:05,951 --> 00:42:07,743
Yeah cuz of intrinsic problems with

890
00:42:07,999 --> 00:42:08,767
Groups of Nazi

891
00:42:09,023 --> 00:42:11,071
Groups of racist come together

892
00:42:11,327 --> 00:42:13,631
And they alienate people on the fence

893
00:42:13,887 --> 00:42:14,655
And that's why you

894
00:42:14,911 --> 00:42:16,447
Can't have those sort of community

895
00:42:16,703 --> 00:42:18,495
That's why Stormfront has like

896
00:42:19,007 --> 00:42:21,567
Their community and the members who have been there but

897
00:42:21,823 --> 00:42:23,871
I don't think there's a lot of new members

898
00:42:24,127 --> 00:42:26,943
Except for people who would already be

899
00:42:27,967 --> 00:42:29,247
Coming of age to be on the internet

900
00:42:34,623 --> 00:42:40,511
The whole other thing is it a whole other thing though very related but unpacking how's that

901
00:42:41,791 --> 00:42:43,327
Has led to a lot of this

902
00:42:43,839 --> 00:42:44,351
Is something

903
00:42:44,607 --> 00:42:50,751
Much smarter people can do and if we try to take us all day

904
00:42:51,007 --> 00:42:56,895
Night to being like it's not that

905
00:42:58,431 --> 00:42:59,455
So

906
00:42:59,967 --> 00:43:00,735
Now we get back

907
00:43:00,991 --> 00:43:02,015
To the showing

908
00:43:02,271 --> 00:43:03,295
Finally get to Alex

909
00:43:05,855 --> 00:43:06,623
You know how much ice

910
00:43:07,647 --> 00:43:08,159
Because

911
00:43:11,231 --> 00:43:17,375
Only had like four thousand viewers on there there

912
00:43:17,631 --> 00:43:21,983
Gets into that a little bit here and a little bit of like I understand that I don't really

913
00:43:23,775 --> 00:43:24,287
Explain it away

914
00:43:25,055 --> 00:43:26,591
No sooner had they

915
00:43:35,807 --> 00:43:39,391
Fishing nets

916
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:41,695
Anderson Cooper total failure

917
00:43:41,951 --> 00:43:47,071
$4,000 on his new Facebook show the million dollar store

918
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:49,631
Force-fed and push notifications

919
00:43:50,399 --> 00:43:52,191
Millions of people

920
00:43:52,447 --> 00:43:53,727
They shadowban us

921
00:43:53,983 --> 00:43:56,287
Videos of hundreds of thousands or millions of years

922
00:43:57,311 --> 00:43:59,871
Force

923
00:44:00,383 --> 00:44:01,919
Is he crying or laughing

924
00:44:04,735 --> 00:44:06,015
What's he doing

925
00:44:13,183 --> 00:44:14,463
His Heart's Not in Matlab

926
00:44:14,719 --> 00:44:18,815
So it's a very different version of a class than the lot of them

927
00:44:19,071 --> 00:44:19,583
Yeah

928
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:25,983
He's like I've got a really ham it up for a full sentence I'm holding back the laughter so it sounds like I'm crying

929
00:44:27,519 --> 00:44:29,823
And you know that that's his

930
00:44:32,127 --> 00:44:33,151
The small part of our audio

931
00:44:34,943 --> 00:44:38,271
It's a bit

932
00:44:38,527 --> 00:44:40,831
It is and it isn't

933
00:44:41,087 --> 00:44:41,855
Coming back to In terms

934
00:44:42,111 --> 00:44:44,159
Of this whole episode with his

935
00:44:46,719 --> 00:44:49,279
Is watching streams

936
00:44:49,535 --> 00:44:50,303
A small part of his body

937
00:44:51,071 --> 00:44:55,167
In terms of like okay so there's like two thousand people screaming

938
00:44:55,935 --> 00:44:58,239
That's not a negligible part of his audio

939
00:44:58,751 --> 00:45:03,871
More than sure are probably as

940
00:45:04,383 --> 00:45:05,407
Like engaged

941
00:45:05,919 --> 00:45:06,431
Maybe

942
00:45:06,687 --> 00:45:08,991
I've already bought product

943
00:45:09,247 --> 00:45:11,551
Right maybe it's not the most important thing

944
00:45:11,807 --> 00:45:15,647
Where is like his videos will have like 15 thousand views or something like that

945
00:45:15,903 --> 00:45:16,415
He posts them

946
00:45:16,671 --> 00:45:21,023
Which scandalous salacious bulshit clickbait titles

947
00:45:21,535 --> 00:45:23,071
What they taken away

948
00:45:24,095 --> 00:45:26,399
Relatively small piece of his operation

949
00:45:26,655 --> 00:45:27,935
Compared to what they have life

950
00:45:32,031 --> 00:45:34,335
We'll find out at the end of this hour

951
00:45:34,591 --> 00:45:37,663
Click hell yeah

952
00:45:37,919 --> 00:45:40,479
Done is basically like

953
00:45:42,271 --> 00:45:42,783
You know

954
00:45:43,039 --> 00:45:44,831
Just leave the larger

955
00:45:45,343 --> 00:45:46,623
Syntac

956
00:45:46,879 --> 00:45:48,159
You can sort of impunity

957
00:45:48,671 --> 00:45:49,183
Small piece

958
00:45:49,439 --> 00:45:53,791
Operation who really gives a s***

959
00:45:54,047 --> 00:45:55,327
What's going on

960
00:45:55,583 --> 00:45:57,887
He's allowed to make fun of himself a little bit

961
00:45:58,143 --> 00:46:00,703
Only because the bigger picture is making fun

962
00:46:00,959 --> 00:46:01,727
Anderson Cooper

963
00:46:01,983 --> 00:46:04,031
If history

964
00:46:04,287 --> 00:46:05,567
He probably be presenting it is

965
00:46:07,103 --> 00:46:09,407
He is only able to do that because it

966
00:46:09,663 --> 00:46:10,175
It's now gone

967
00:46:10,943 --> 00:46:11,455
So

968
00:46:11,967 --> 00:46:13,503
It's kind of fun but

969
00:46:13,759 --> 00:46:16,319
Yeah

970
00:46:16,575 --> 00:46:17,855
Weave

971
00:46:18,111 --> 00:46:18,623
It's super in

972
00:46:18,879 --> 00:46:20,159
Christine yet it's all just kind of like

973
00:46:23,999 --> 00:46:24,511
I don't think it's true

974
00:46:25,023 --> 00:46:26,815
But

975
00:46:29,887 --> 00:46:36,031
I think it's actually more of an embedded

976
00:46:36,287 --> 00:46:39,359
Atlantic

977
00:46:39,615 --> 00:46:41,151
He kind of gives away that

978
00:46:41,407 --> 00:46:42,431
He knows exactly

979
00:46:42,687 --> 00:46:44,479
How to benefit off things like

980
00:46:44,735 --> 00:46:45,503
What's happening

981
00:46:47,807 --> 00:46:50,367
Is beyond a dog dropping its Beyond fake

982
00:46:50,879 --> 00:46:57,023
This is after he's done like maybe 30 seconds on Like You cover a dog s*** and fudge try and feed rag

983
00:47:04,447 --> 00:47:06,239
Notice for tortious interference

984
00:47:09,311 --> 00:47:12,639
Lawsuits follow my followers I can win them out a percent

985
00:47:15,967 --> 00:47:18,783
April of last year for Alex Jones

986
00:47:19,295 --> 00:47:22,367
When he was up in court against said

987
00:47:22,623 --> 00:47:23,647
I will win this

988
00:47:23,903 --> 00:47:25,183
Or I will die

989
00:47:25,439 --> 00:47:27,999
And as we all know he won

990
00:47:28,255 --> 00:47:31,583
Topology

991
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:34,399
Political

992
00:47:36,703 --> 00:47:42,847
They are on television about what I said

993
00:47:43,359 --> 00:47:45,663
Publishers people fired

994
00:47:46,175 --> 00:47:46,687
Because

995
00:47:51,039 --> 00:47:51,551
Hilltop

996
00:47:52,063 --> 00:47:54,111
Live Neil Strauss

997
00:47:54,879 --> 00:47:55,903
Future

998
00:47:56,671 --> 00:47:58,719
Secret history of the world in the war for the future

999
00:48:02,559 --> 00:48:03,583
The Superhead

1000
00:48:04,607 --> 00:48:07,935
Of course publisher cell

1001
00:48:15,615 --> 00:48:16,127
Yeah

1002
00:48:16,895 --> 00:48:18,687
God dammit

1003
00:48:20,735 --> 00:48:24,063
It's still on his own

1004
00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:27,391
Damn right I mean it's not a scam but it is like

1005
00:48:27,647 --> 00:48:29,183
Paul Walker

1006
00:48:29,439 --> 00:48:30,463
It's not a trap

1007
00:48:30,719 --> 00:48:31,231
It's just

1008
00:48:32,255 --> 00:48:35,071
You know it's getting outrageous

1009
00:48:36,607 --> 00:48:41,727
Why whenever people are

1010
00:48:41,983 --> 00:48:44,031
Ban Alex Jones kind of mood

1011
00:48:45,567 --> 00:48:51,455
Guess you're probably consider what the actual outcome of that is because he probably has

1012
00:48:51,711 --> 00:48:54,783
The only thing he doesn't have a name strategy

1013
00:48:55,039 --> 00:48:55,807
Literally Banning

1014
00:48:56,319 --> 00:48:58,367
Kick him off YouTube

1015
00:48:58,623 --> 00:48:59,903
You do kick him off Facebook

1016
00:49:00,159 --> 00:49:01,183
Keith f***

1017
00:49:01,695 --> 00:49:05,279
His Radio engagement is not nearly what he claims are there

1018
00:49:05,535 --> 00:49:07,071
So if you kick him off

1019
00:49:07,327 --> 00:49:07,839
Legitimate

1020
00:49:08,351 --> 00:49:10,143
Ban all the Infowars

1021
00:49:10,399 --> 00:49:13,471
Correspondence from Facebook main page

1022
00:49:13,983 --> 00:49:14,751
Kick it all off

1023
00:49:15,007 --> 00:49:16,543
Takeaway streaming capability

1024
00:49:17,055 --> 00:49:18,335
Like have someone on it

1025
00:49:18,591 --> 00:49:20,639
Like be able to clearly tell

1026
00:49:20,895 --> 00:49:23,711
Oh this is a dummy account that's being put up in order to

1027
00:49:23,967 --> 00:49:28,319
You get around the band have someone there to cut off the temples as they come up

1028
00:49:28,831 --> 00:49:29,343
Phoebe Fox

1029
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:31,903
The only thing you can do anything else

1030
00:49:34,975 --> 00:49:36,767
You can't do what I'm advocating

1031
00:49:37,023 --> 00:49:37,791
For now because

1032
00:49:38,303 --> 00:49:40,095
You already backed yourself into f****** corner

1033
00:49:42,399 --> 00:49:43,679
Stupid

1034
00:49:46,239 --> 00:49:48,031
Great tracks should stop being stupid about the

1035
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:51,871
To the point where it seems like

1036
00:49:52,383 --> 00:49:55,711
They are in on it

1037
00:49:56,223 --> 00:49:57,503
It almost seems like

1038
00:49:57,759 --> 00:49:59,807
Email Facebook

1039
00:50:00,063 --> 00:50:01,599
Hey I got a game for both of us

1040
00:50:02,367 --> 00:50:03,647
Let's do the two-man game on this

1041
00:50:03,903 --> 00:50:05,439
It seems like maybe Alex

1042
00:50:05,695 --> 00:50:08,511
Gives Facebook $10,000 a month or so

1043
00:50:08,767 --> 00:50:09,535
In-N-Out

1044
00:50:09,791 --> 00:50:10,559
Promoting post

1045
00:50:11,071 --> 00:50:13,119
And stuff like that and he's like I don't

1046
00:50:13,375 --> 00:50:14,143
You know

1047
00:50:14,399 --> 00:50:18,751
That's going to go away or something like that

1048
00:50:19,007 --> 00:50:21,311
There's got to be some sort of a calculus to it but

1049
00:50:21,823 --> 00:50:23,359
Whatever it is nobody's active

1050
00:50:23,871 --> 00:50:24,639
Right now

1051
00:50:25,407 --> 00:50:25,919
Neither a wenis

1052
00:50:26,687 --> 00:50:28,991
Have the answer

1053
00:50:29,247 --> 00:50:30,271
I don't think we've ever

1054
00:50:30,783 --> 00:50:31,551
That anybody's

1055
00:50:32,063 --> 00:50:33,343
Right let alone us

1056
00:50:34,623 --> 00:50:35,135
The Bill Ayers

1057
00:50:38,207 --> 00:50:38,975
Killing it

1058
00:50:39,231 --> 00:50:43,071
Here Alex Jones to the store

1059
00:50:44,095 --> 00:50:47,935
From all this stuff it's that video about

1060
00:50:51,519 --> 00:50:52,287
You talk about how

1061
00:50:59,711 --> 00:51:01,759
He's talking about the viral video of the kid

1062
00:51:02,271 --> 00:51:02,783
Yeah

1063
00:51:03,551 --> 00:51:04,575
I guess KVUE

1064
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:15,327
That was dumb

1065
00:51:15,583 --> 00:51:18,399
That was a different time

1066
00:51:35,039 --> 00:51:40,927
And they're holding up the article

1067
00:51:41,951 --> 00:51:43,487
People aren't doing that

1068
00:51:43,743 --> 00:51:46,559
His ex-wife is doing

1069
00:51:47,583 --> 00:51:49,119
It's not like strain

1070
00:51:50,911 --> 00:51:52,703
Because no one else has standing

1071
00:51:52,959 --> 00:51:55,007
The file that stores

1072
00:51:55,263 --> 00:51:56,799
To presenting this as some sort of a concert

1073
00:51:57,055 --> 00:51:58,847
People lying about

1074
00:51:59,103 --> 00:52:01,663
What you did with this video

1075
00:52:01,919 --> 00:52:05,503
It is if you were if you follow his ex-wife on Twitter

1076
00:52:05,759 --> 00:52:09,343
It's a continuation of exactly what she's been doing for quite a while

1077
00:52:09,855 --> 00:52:12,927
And Alex presented as like the media is a blank

1078
00:52:13,183 --> 00:52:14,975
That's really what Kelly has been tweeting about

1079
00:52:16,511 --> 00:52:18,559
On Thursday night Kelly went down to

1080
00:52:18,815 --> 00:52:19,327
To the courthouse

1081
00:52:19,583 --> 00:52:21,631
And was filing an emergency

1082
00:52:21,887 --> 00:52:22,399
The order

1083
00:52:22,655 --> 00:52:24,703
And I don't believe it was because of that video

1084
00:52:25,215 --> 00:52:26,239
I believe it was

1085
00:52:26,495 --> 00:52:27,263
She'd had enough

1086
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:28,543
Yeah

1087
00:52:28,799 --> 00:52:29,311
Micah

1088
00:52:29,823 --> 00:52:30,847
Not our business

1089
00:52:32,383 --> 00:52:33,151
So

1090
00:52:34,175 --> 00:52:34,943
Earlier Alex

1091
00:52:35,199 --> 00:52:35,711
Who's pitching the app

1092
00:52:36,223 --> 00:52:38,271
Stanza in this next clip

1093
00:52:38,527 --> 00:52:39,551
You pictures something else

1094
00:52:40,063 --> 00:52:42,111
That I think is more indicative

1095
00:52:42,367 --> 00:52:44,159
That lykinos that

1096
00:52:44,415 --> 00:52:44,927
Do you need the backup

1097
00:52:45,951 --> 00:52:52,095
Source in the world

1098
00:53:06,943 --> 00:53:07,967
She's pushing the newsletter

1099
00:53:09,247 --> 00:53:09,759
Newsletter

1100
00:53:10,015 --> 00:53:12,063
Email newsletter

1101
00:53:12,319 --> 00:53:14,367
Which I actually signed up for it a dummy account

1102
00:53:14,623 --> 00:53:16,671
Because I figured they're going to start sending a bunch

1103
00:53:17,695 --> 00:53:18,975
Like selling my address

1104
00:53:19,231 --> 00:53:22,559
Account did not do anything else

1105
00:53:24,351 --> 00:53:26,655
It was all just Infowars

1106
00:53:26,911 --> 00:53:30,495
But it was bizarre I thought for sure like I'd be getting tons of spam tons

1107
00:53:31,007 --> 00:53:37,151
Unsolicited emails

1108
00:53:37,407 --> 00:53:43,551
Not doing that there's a lot of abusive practices you could be in

1109
00:53:46,879 --> 00:53:53,023
Again we are pitching ideas for should be no money off of it

1110
00:53:53,279 --> 00:53:53,791
Stream that you're not

1111
00:53:54,303 --> 00:53:56,607
Maybe they know that now

1112
00:53:56,863 --> 00:54:03,007
Yeah because they're about to start I don't know

1113
00:54:04,287 --> 00:54:05,567
Because I don't know if that's the case

1114
00:54:05,823 --> 00:54:07,359
I have not heard

1115
00:54:11,455 --> 00:54:11,967
Livestock

1116
00:54:12,991 --> 00:54:16,063
Maybe a month or so as long as

1117
00:54:16,575 --> 00:54:21,951
But it has pretty much as long as I think

1118
00:54:22,975 --> 00:54:23,999
Yeah

1119
00:54:24,511 --> 00:54:26,815
Never really here lots of

1120
00:54:27,071 --> 00:54:27,839
Commercials for the

1121
00:54:28,095 --> 00:54:28,607
The newsletter

1122
00:54:28,863 --> 00:54:29,887
44 the app

1123
00:54:30,143 --> 00:54:31,423
Or anything like that

1124
00:54:31,679 --> 00:54:32,447
Either

1125
00:54:32,703 --> 00:54:33,471
You've never

1126
00:54:33,727 --> 00:54:34,495
You've never

1127
00:54:35,263 --> 00:54:37,055
Play them for me in the past

1128
00:54:37,311 --> 00:54:38,847
That seems suspicious

1129
00:54:39,103 --> 00:54:42,175
If I never heard an ad for the newsletter

1130
00:54:42,431 --> 00:54:44,223
Which I don't think I ever have

1131
00:54:44,735 --> 00:54:46,271
That is after 8

1132
00:54:46,527 --> 00:54:47,551
Year-and-a-half of doing

1133
00:54:47,807 --> 00:54:48,831
Bananas

1134
00:54:50,623 --> 00:54:51,903
For literally every

1135
00:54:52,159 --> 00:54:54,719
Commercials for stuff like that back in

1136
00:54:54,975 --> 00:54:56,255
2009-2010

1137
00:54:56,511 --> 00:54:57,535
Cuz you have instances of like

1138
00:54:58,047 --> 00:54:59,327
At that point

1139
00:54:59,583 --> 00:55:01,119
Are you selling Infowars.

1140
00:55:01,375 --> 00:55:02,655
TV prisonplanet.tv

1141
00:55:02,911 --> 00:55:03,423
Subscription

1142
00:55:03,679 --> 00:55:05,983
You can get the video and stuff like that

1143
00:55:06,239 --> 00:55:09,823
If you join this cuz he didn't have a robust presence on like

1144
00:55:11,359 --> 00:55:13,151
There is that

1145
00:55:13,663 --> 00:55:14,431
Bitten

1146
00:55:15,199 --> 00:55:16,735
IHOP his muscle

1147
00:55:16,991 --> 00:55:17,759
But because you may

1148
00:55:18,271 --> 00:55:20,575
How much money are supplements and all that stuff and

1149
00:55:21,343 --> 00:55:26,463
Whatever you never did like it fell by the wayside we have a situation

1150
00:55:26,719 --> 00:55:27,231
Cease

1151
00:55:28,255 --> 00:55:29,535
Maybe possible

1152
00:55:29,791 --> 00:55:30,559
That they're going to f***

1153
00:55:31,071 --> 00:55:31,839
Record

1154
00:55:32,351 --> 00:55:34,911
Remind me to backup plan

1155
00:55:35,167 --> 00:55:36,191
Let's build this app

1156
00:55:36,703 --> 00:55:40,031
Make sure more people get on the newsletter so we can email them

1157
00:55:40,287 --> 00:55:41,055
And scare them

1158
00:55:41,567 --> 00:55:43,103
We need

1159
00:55:43,359 --> 00:55:45,407
Define new tentacles

1160
00:55:51,039 --> 00:55:52,831
Also has to have an adverb

1161
00:55:53,343 --> 00:55:53,855
Absolutely

1162
00:55:54,367 --> 00:55:57,695
Most of this episode has been

1163
00:55:57,951 --> 00:55:58,975
Serta dealing with

1164
00:56:01,023 --> 00:56:01,791
And what have you

1165
00:56:02,047 --> 00:56:03,839
I think I said

1166
00:56:04,863 --> 00:56:05,887
I think I've said my peace

1167
00:56:06,143 --> 00:56:06,911
I think you said your peace

1168
00:56:07,167 --> 00:56:09,215
I don't think there's going to be much more of it

1169
00:56:09,983 --> 00:56:10,495
But

1170
00:56:11,007 --> 00:56:14,591
The rest of this episode is clearly indicative of what people

1171
00:56:15,103 --> 00:56:16,895
Should be talkin about about Alex Jones

1172
00:56:18,687 --> 00:56:19,967
This is very important

1173
00:56:20,991 --> 00:56:22,271
Because this is not different than ever

1174
00:56:24,575 --> 00:56:26,623
F****** July 27th

1175
00:56:26,879 --> 00:56:28,159
2018 episode

1176
00:56:28,415 --> 00:56:29,183
Where he is

1177
00:56:29,439 --> 00:56:30,975
Responding to being banned

1178
00:56:31,231 --> 00:56:31,999
We will hear

1179
00:56:33,023 --> 00:56:34,559
Monsterous ship

1180
00:56:37,631 --> 00:56:38,399
Sabine Bandits

1181
00:56:38,655 --> 00:56:41,983
Even more van worthy who is first clip

1182
00:56:42,239 --> 00:56:43,519
Really necessarily

1183
00:56:44,031 --> 00:56:45,311
But it's absolutely

1184
00:56:45,823 --> 00:56:47,615
Conversation about Alex Jones

1185
00:56:47,871 --> 00:56:48,639
That most people are missing

1186
00:56:52,479 --> 00:56:53,503
Tucker Carlson

1187
00:56:59,135 --> 00:57:00,927
And

1188
00:57:02,207 --> 00:57:02,975
Steven Crowder

1189
00:57:05,023 --> 00:57:07,071
Because otherwise

1190
00:57:09,119 --> 00:57:10,911
White

1191
00:57:11,423 --> 00:57:13,471
Lose weight

1192
00:57:28,063 --> 00:57:30,367
Just like they say every hour on the hour

1193
00:57:30,879 --> 00:57:32,415
Trump hates Hispanic

1194
00:57:32,671 --> 00:57:33,951
And said they're all right person

1195
00:57:38,559 --> 00:57:39,327
Star

1196
00:57:46,495 --> 00:57:48,287
Donald Trump and Hitler

1197
00:57:48,543 --> 00:57:49,055
Yes

1198
00:57:49,311 --> 00:57:50,591
Swimming

1199
00:57:53,407 --> 00:57:54,431
This is all about

1200
00:57:55,199 --> 00:57:56,223
He's spread nmds

1201
00:57:56,479 --> 00:57:57,247
This is just

1202
00:57:57,503 --> 00:57:58,527
Spreading white Spears

1203
00:57:58,783 --> 00:58:01,087
Someone against took a pickaxe

1204
00:58:01,343 --> 00:58:02,367
To the Hollywood

1205
00:58:02,623 --> 00:58:07,231
Star outside Grauman's Chinese Theater

1206
00:58:07,487 --> 00:58:10,047
Not as good as ever

1207
00:58:11,071 --> 00:58:11,583
Let loose

1208
00:58:11,839 --> 00:58:12,607
Betsy DeVos

1209
00:58:12,863 --> 00:58:13,375
Yacht

1210
00:58:13,631 --> 00:58:16,191
That's my favorite thing

1211
00:58:16,447 --> 00:58:17,727
Such a good thing to do

1212
00:58:18,751 --> 00:58:21,055
I'm disappointed that it wasn't burnt to the ground

1213
00:58:21,311 --> 00:58:23,359
At the same time that carries over water

1214
00:58:23,871 --> 00:58:24,383
Fair enough

1215
00:58:24,639 --> 00:58:27,711
That carries a far larger so I respect

1216
00:58:27,967 --> 00:58:31,295
Alex talks a lot about this

1217
00:58:31,551 --> 00:58:35,135
I don't know if we're going to hear all that much more about it but he talks a ton

1218
00:58:35,391 --> 00:58:37,183
About this incident

1219
00:58:37,439 --> 00:58:38,719
The Hollywood

1220
00:58:38,975 --> 00:58:39,999
Star

1221
00:58:41,535 --> 00:58:43,583
Just like

1222
00:58:43,839 --> 00:58:47,167
Hispanics but here they are

1223
00:58:47,423 --> 00:58:47,935
That's all

1224
00:58:53,567 --> 00:58:54,591
Text to beat up lights

1225
00:58:55,871 --> 00:58:56,383
Okay fine

1226
00:58:56,639 --> 00:58:58,175
Whatever

1227
00:58:58,431 --> 00:59:03,295
Like what

1228
00:59:05,087 --> 00:59:11,231
Everybody situation that I didn't know about these pugs and I couldn't even beat up these two

1229
00:59:11,487 --> 00:59:11,999
Dudes

1230
00:59:12,511 --> 00:59:13,023
I just don't

1231
00:59:14,815 --> 00:59:17,119
It's so standard for him but at the same time

1232
00:59:18,655 --> 00:59:19,167
I don't get it

1233
00:59:19,423 --> 00:59:20,703
It's more fun in this kind

1234
00:59:21,471 --> 00:59:22,239
He's clearly

1235
00:59:23,263 --> 00:59:24,031
Felix

1236
00:59:24,799 --> 00:59:26,847
He's acting like he's up against the wall

1237
00:59:27,103 --> 00:59:31,199
Closer to him actually

1238
00:59:31,455 --> 00:59:32,223
Normally is act

1239
00:59:32,479 --> 00:59:34,015
He's up against the wall do you know what I mean

1240
00:59:36,063 --> 00:59:37,855
He's at the point where he does

1241
00:59:38,111 --> 00:59:38,623
Feel like

1242
00:59:39,391 --> 00:59:42,207
I could be up against the wall

1243
00:59:43,487 --> 00:59:43,999
But I'm

1244
00:59:44,255 --> 00:59:46,815
You still going to play it

1245
00:59:47,583 --> 00:59:49,375
But now there's a little bit more elevated

1246
00:59:51,423 --> 00:59:54,239
Slightly different in the near future

1247
00:59:54,751 --> 00:59:58,079
Close to a wall

1248
01:00:00,127 --> 01:00:06,271
Not since humbio Lucaya have I been up against there was a window we could crawl out of Woodruff

1249
01:00:11,647 --> 01:00:13,439
Alex if nothing else

1250
01:00:13,695 --> 01:00:14,975
You start to realize

1251
01:00:15,231 --> 01:00:16,511
Pretty good gambler

1252
01:00:16,767 --> 01:00:18,559
Like internships

1253
01:00:18,815 --> 01:00:19,839
Someone bluffing

1254
01:00:20,095 --> 01:00:22,655
Cuz almost all the time these people are bluffing what's

1255
01:00:24,191 --> 01:00:25,215
At this point

1256
01:00:25,471 --> 01:00:27,263
He's dealt with so many people

1257
01:00:27,519 --> 01:00:29,823
Or just weeks he can just like

1258
01:00:30,079 --> 01:00:31,103
Velocipastor

1259
01:00:31,359 --> 01:00:32,383
Like

1260
01:00:33,407 --> 01:00:35,455
No one ever calls this s***

1261
01:00:35,711 --> 01:00:38,271
You know it was never adequately explained to me about

1262
01:00:38,783 --> 01:00:39,295
How is

1263
01:00:39,551 --> 01:00:45,695
An apology illegitimate legal agreement probably also

1264
01:00:48,767 --> 01:00:51,839
I don't know all that stuff

1265
01:00:52,095 --> 01:00:56,191
Problems released about that says

1266
01:00:56,447 --> 01:00:56,959
To be able to

1267
01:00:57,215 --> 01:00:57,983
Use Somebody

1268
01:00:58,239 --> 01:00:59,007
I'm sorry

1269
01:00:59,519 --> 01:01:00,799
Millionaire

1270
01:01:01,055 --> 01:01:03,615
In a billionaire

1271
01:01:03,871 --> 01:01:04,639
Can you just want

1272
01:01:04,895 --> 01:01:05,663
Someone to be like

1273
01:01:06,175 --> 01:01:07,455
Brought low in public

1274
01:01:07,711 --> 01:01:13,599
Cuz all he was doing was lying about

1275
01:01:13,855 --> 01:01:18,207
Super negative to the guy's business or anything like that punishment

1276
01:01:18,463 --> 01:01:19,487
Kind of unnecessary

1277
01:01:20,255 --> 01:01:21,535
But it would be more fun

1278
01:01:21,791 --> 01:01:23,071
Honor dictates

1279
01:01:23,327 --> 01:01:24,607
Apologize

1280
01:01:24,863 --> 01:01:25,631
That's all you're really asked

1281
01:01:25,887 --> 01:01:27,423
Before I don't like gentlemen

1282
01:01:27,679 --> 01:01:32,031
Yeah I don't know

1283
01:01:32,287 --> 01:01:33,311
Friends bulshit

1284
01:01:33,567 --> 01:01:34,335
I don't know what to tell you

1285
01:01:34,847 --> 01:01:36,895
Shadowbanned

1286
01:01:38,431 --> 01:01:38,943
I don't know if we need

1287
01:01:39,199 --> 01:01:41,759
Need to get into that fully maybe we will a little bit later

1288
01:01:42,015 --> 01:01:43,295
Another guest

1289
01:01:43,551 --> 01:01:44,063
Shows up

1290
01:01:44,319 --> 01:01:45,599
We can talk about it at that point

1291
01:01:48,159 --> 01:01:49,183
But here Alex

1292
01:01:51,743 --> 01:01:52,511
How to get them fair enough

1293
01:01:53,023 --> 01:01:57,887
I want in Missouri a month ago I didn't

1294
01:02:04,287 --> 01:02:08,383
YouTube

1295
01:02:12,479 --> 01:02:14,783
Be spending all his time and energy

1296
01:02:28,351 --> 01:02:29,631
Americans are the enemy

1297
01:02:29,887 --> 01:02:30,399
Obscene

1298
01:02:30,655 --> 01:02:31,679
Just a trumpet set

1299
01:02:32,191 --> 01:02:32,703
Good

1300
01:02:32,959 --> 01:02:33,983
Good read

1301
01:02:37,055 --> 01:02:38,079
That's not dangerous at all

1302
01:02:38,847 --> 01:02:39,359
Just like

1303
01:02:39,615 --> 01:02:40,127
People don't run

1304
01:02:40,383 --> 01:02:40,895
Understand

1305
01:02:41,663 --> 01:02:42,175
Americans

1306
01:02:42,687 --> 01:02:43,199
Against the

1307
01:02:43,455 --> 01:02:43,967
The Free Press

1308
01:02:46,015 --> 01:02:46,527
President

1309
01:02:47,551 --> 01:02:48,319
The trust anyone

1310
01:02:51,391 --> 01:02:55,487
I'm saying is that if

1311
01:02:56,255 --> 01:02:58,047
Trump

1312
01:02:58,815 --> 01:03:03,935
You know my whole family and all of the Multicultural people I've ever met or like

1313
01:03:04,447 --> 01:03:07,007
You are evil for supporting Trump and Trump was like

1314
01:03:07,263 --> 01:03:08,287
They don't respect you

1315
01:03:08,543 --> 01:03:09,567
And you should murder all

1316
01:03:09,823 --> 01:03:15,967
Almost

1317
01:03:16,223 --> 01:03:16,991
Looks like there's a parallel

1318
01:03:17,759 --> 01:03:20,319
Who sings almost like there was a

1319
01:03:20,575 --> 01:03:21,855
Cruel cruel con man

1320
01:03:22,879 --> 01:03:24,159
Seem to like

1321
01:03:24,415 --> 01:03:25,183
Attract like

1322
01:03:27,487 --> 01:03:32,095
Was reading of one of those articles about Alex's band and they made a really good point

1323
01:03:33,119 --> 01:03:35,679
Send email to

1324
01:03:37,215 --> 01:03:38,495
Really not done too much

1325
01:03:38,751 --> 01:03:39,775
Three like Alex Jones

1326
01:03:40,031 --> 01:03:41,311
Is great

1327
01:03:41,567 --> 01:03:42,847
That's really

1328
01:03:44,383 --> 01:03:47,455
Not intellectually you're not in terms of like the argument

1329
01:03:47,711 --> 01:03:50,015
They're still clear overlapping parallel but like

1330
01:03:50,783 --> 01:03:51,551
He went on in

1331
01:03:51,807 --> 01:03:53,599
2015 inside your reputation

1332
01:03:53,855 --> 01:03:55,135
Is amazing and all that stuff

1333
01:03:55,391 --> 01:03:57,439
Scentsy elected I don't think I give the s***

1334
01:03:58,463 --> 01:04:02,559
Alex is one of the contractors that Trump has used in

1335
01:04:02,815 --> 01:04:03,327
Building

1336
01:04:05,119 --> 01:04:05,887
Moerlein

1337
01:04:06,399 --> 01:04:10,495
Episode

1338
01:04:13,311 --> 01:04:13,823
Copyright

1339
01:04:14,591 --> 01:04:15,103
Trademark

1340
01:04:16,383 --> 01:04:18,431
Super male vitality

1341
01:04:18,687 --> 01:04:20,223
Super female Vitality all his lap

1342
01:04:20,735 --> 01:04:22,783
He hasn't renewed those copyright yeah

1343
01:04:23,039 --> 01:04:24,063
But I found some new ones

1344
01:04:24,575 --> 01:04:26,879
And one of them was Firepower radio

1345
01:04:27,135 --> 01:04:30,719
I believe vagina tonight

1346
01:04:30,975 --> 01:04:35,583
Same cut through the b******* gives you a boner

1347
01:04:36,351 --> 01:04:41,727
Remember if it was Firepower radio or something something like that and then the other one was honor roll

1348
01:04:42,495 --> 01:04:46,847
And someone I apologize group posted that

1349
01:04:47,103 --> 01:04:49,151
That's obviously going to be the name of Rex

1350
01:04:49,407 --> 01:04:49,919
The show

1351
01:04:50,175 --> 01:04:56,319
It's going to be young info Warriors and I got terrified

1352
01:05:00,415 --> 01:05:05,535
Yeah that's a great name is Alex's copyrighting or trade market

1353
01:05:12,703 --> 01:05:14,239
Too close to Howard Dean

1354
01:05:14,495 --> 01:05:15,007
Not going to work

1355
01:05:16,287 --> 01:05:17,055
So

1356
01:05:17,311 --> 01:05:18,079
But

1357
01:05:19,359 --> 01:05:20,639
Suggestion was made of

1358
01:05:20,895 --> 01:05:23,967
Holy s*** that is a really good possibility

1359
01:05:24,223 --> 01:05:28,319
For what this is going to end up being

1360
01:05:28,575 --> 01:05:31,135
My first reaction

1361
01:05:31,391 --> 01:05:33,951
Trinidad is obviously Alex will not do that

1362
01:05:34,207 --> 01:05:35,487
Because that's a great idea

1363
01:05:35,743 --> 01:05:36,255
And once again

1364
01:05:38,559 --> 01:05:39,071
Infowars

1365
01:05:39,583 --> 01:05:40,095
I don't know

1366
01:05:40,351 --> 01:05:45,215
I don't know but in this episode

1367
01:05:45,727 --> 01:05:47,007
For honor roll

1368
01:05:47,263 --> 01:05:48,031
Which is the news

1369
01:05:49,311 --> 01:05:55,455
Then you've got honor roll dishes why it took us a couple years because I got a little something I said

1370
01:06:02,111 --> 01:06:08,255
Aw colors we have done it this baby right here just the nuclear option

1371
01:06:08,511 --> 01:06:14,655
You want to give your children the Boost

1372
01:06:27,711 --> 01:06:33,855
I do that

1373
01:06:46,655 --> 01:06:47,167
Real quick

1374
01:06:51,007 --> 01:06:57,151
Playlist like an advertisement in more like a f****** break down and real music

1375
01:06:57,407 --> 01:06:59,199
This is a prepackaged

1376
01:07:01,759 --> 01:07:03,551
Oil

1377
01:07:05,343 --> 01:07:07,903
You see those clear oils that look like water

1378
01:07:08,159 --> 01:07:09,951
Disgusting you see you later

1379
01:07:10,207 --> 01:07:12,255
They look like urine that's even grosser

1380
01:07:14,047 --> 01:07:17,119
Gorge

1381
01:07:17,631 --> 01:07:18,399
Orange

1382
01:07:20,191 --> 01:07:20,703
So

1383
01:07:20,959 --> 01:07:21,983
I just love that like

1384
01:07:24,287 --> 01:07:30,431
Option for your funeral

1385
01:07:37,087 --> 01:07:37,599
It's official

1386
01:07:41,183 --> 01:07:42,975
Recently been debunked

1387
01:07:43,487 --> 01:07:44,511
For the Millions

1388
01:07:44,767 --> 01:07:49,631
Terrible

1389
01:07:49,887 --> 01:07:51,167
It's a little overblown

1390
01:07:51,423 --> 01:07:53,215
In the same way is like a ginkgo biloba

1391
01:07:53,727 --> 01:07:55,519
Or something like that or any vouchers

1392
01:07:55,775 --> 01:08:00,383
Call Matt Marty was texting me earlier today cuz he was in an Uber

1393
01:08:05,503 --> 01:08:06,527
The driver was Infowars

1394
01:08:13,439 --> 01:08:15,999
I would so like all God this is awful

1395
01:08:16,767 --> 01:08:22,911
So rare to have like in the wild officially I can't

1396
01:08:23,167 --> 01:08:23,935
Do like

1397
01:08:24,191 --> 01:08:25,983
I will say one thing I don't think

1398
01:08:26,239 --> 01:08:28,287
I don't think ill of people who've

1399
01:08:28,543 --> 01:08:29,567
Drive to Alex's belief

1400
01:08:29,823 --> 01:08:30,591
Necessarily

1401
01:08:30,847 --> 01:08:33,407
I think there's probably a lot of well-meaning this life

1402
01:08:33,663 --> 01:08:34,431
People in that group

1403
01:08:34,943 --> 01:08:36,991
But I will save the ones that I've ever met

1404
01:08:37,503 --> 01:08:38,271
Not made for the service

1405
01:08:39,807 --> 01:08:40,575
I will

1406
01:08:40,831 --> 01:08:42,623
I feel

1407
01:08:42,879 --> 01:08:45,183
I feel like that stuff and then I also feel like

1408
01:08:45,695 --> 01:08:46,463
Probably tough issue

1409
01:08:46,719 --> 01:08:47,999
If you're someone who works

1410
01:08:48,511 --> 01:08:49,023
For Lyft

1411
01:08:49,791 --> 01:08:51,327
You're kind of in the gig economy

1412
01:08:51,583 --> 01:08:55,423
It's weird for you to Zendaya propping up a propagandist

1413
01:08:55,679 --> 01:09:01,567
Who is really super into keeping you in the gig economy struggling and driving people around for Penny

1414
01:09:01,823 --> 01:09:03,103
That's the trick

1415
01:09:03,615 --> 01:09:05,663
Conservative movement

1416
01:09:05,919 --> 01:09:07,199
Check the billionaires have pulled off

1417
01:09:07,455 --> 01:09:08,735
For so long as they're like

1418
01:09:08,991 --> 01:09:09,759
Your interest

1419
01:09:11,039 --> 01:09:11,551
Parable

1420
01:09:12,063 --> 01:09:12,575
You need

1421
01:09:12,831 --> 01:09:13,599
To have my entire

1422
01:09:14,623 --> 01:09:15,135
And my interest

1423
01:09:15,391 --> 01:09:17,183
Army making a lot more money

1424
01:09:17,439 --> 01:09:18,207
And you making not

1425
01:09:18,463 --> 01:09:23,327
Believe that you suck it allowed to have

1426
01:09:24,351 --> 01:09:24,863
Believe

1427
01:09:25,119 --> 01:09:27,935
That you will all I know

1428
01:09:29,471 --> 01:09:32,543
I was texting about this earlier that's kind of something I'm worried about with

1429
01:09:32,799 --> 01:09:33,823
My new favorite show

1430
01:09:34,335 --> 01:09:38,687
That I've got you on apparently Phil Rosenthal

1431
01:09:39,711 --> 01:09:40,479
I'm out

1432
01:09:41,503 --> 01:09:43,807
I love I watch

1433
01:09:44,063 --> 01:09:48,159
So if you guys are not watch this I recommend giving it a whirl

1434
01:09:48,415 --> 01:09:50,207
Delightful and Charming

1435
01:09:50,463 --> 01:09:53,535
There's a PBS show called I'll have what Phil's having

1436
01:09:54,303 --> 01:10:00,447
That got branched out into a Netflix series called somebody feed Phil

1437
01:10:00,703 --> 01:10:04,031
The guy who created Everybody Loves Raymond

1438
01:10:04,543 --> 01:10:05,055
Is a billionaire

1439
01:10:05,311 --> 01:10:07,871
Pusher he goes around the world and

1440
01:10:08,127 --> 01:10:09,663
He's trying to extol the virtues of

1441
01:10:09,919 --> 01:10:10,431
Traveling

1442
01:10:10,687 --> 01:10:13,759
And how food brings people together.

1443
01:10:14,015 --> 01:10:15,295
Beautiful things

1444
01:10:15,551 --> 01:10:17,599
For he goes in like has these

1445
01:10:18,623 --> 01:10:20,415
Top chefs around the world making meals

1446
01:10:20,671 --> 01:10:22,719
But they never in any way

1447
01:10:22,975 --> 01:10:23,487
Address

1448
01:10:23,743 --> 01:10:26,047
The fact that he's a billionaire

1449
01:10:26,303 --> 01:10:29,119
He even in the I'll have what Phil's having

1450
01:10:29,375 --> 01:10:32,703
The entire premise of the show the beginning of every episode

1451
01:10:32,959 --> 01:10:36,031
You can have what I'm having

1452
01:10:36,287 --> 01:10:41,407
You f****** evil if you can afford it you can't travel like that

1453
01:10:41,663 --> 01:10:45,503
You can meet people absolutely

1454
01:10:45,759 --> 01:10:48,319
So like a parallel for me like I went to Greece

1455
01:10:48,575 --> 01:10:50,623
With my family when I in 2007

1456
01:10:51,135 --> 01:10:53,695
And for a week of Italy

1457
01:10:54,207 --> 01:10:54,719
Concurrent

1458
01:10:54,975 --> 01:10:55,999
Who's kind of a bummer

1459
01:10:56,255 --> 01:10:58,303
My dad was like working on archaeological

1460
01:10:58,559 --> 01:10:59,071
Kodiak bear

1461
01:10:59,327 --> 01:11:00,095
Yeah it sounds

1462
01:11:01,119 --> 01:11:01,631
Paul's Church

1463
01:11:03,423 --> 01:11:03,935
Little Shack

1464
01:11:05,215 --> 01:11:05,727
3 weeks

1465
01:11:06,495 --> 01:11:08,543
Kind of sleepy bar

1466
01:11:09,567 --> 01:11:10,591
Street where they have

1467
01:11:10,847 --> 01:11:11,359
Shops like

1468
01:11:11,615 --> 01:11:13,151
Chemical stop at them

1469
01:11:13,663 --> 01:11:14,687
A couple decent restaurants

1470
01:11:15,967 --> 01:11:17,759
But luckily my girlfriend

1471
01:11:18,015 --> 01:11:19,295
Her family was going to

1472
01:11:19,551 --> 01:11:20,575
To somewhere in Italy

1473
01:11:21,087 --> 01:11:22,623
It was close enough that she came

1474
01:11:22,879 --> 01:11:23,647
Degrees for a week

1475
01:11:23,903 --> 01:11:24,671
That is a

1476
01:11:24,927 --> 01:11:25,951
Coincidence

1477
01:11:26,207 --> 01:11:26,719
Really awesome

1478
01:11:26,975 --> 01:11:28,767
Sometime

1479
01:11:29,023 --> 01:11:29,791
She and I

1480
01:11:30,047 --> 01:11:31,583
Got a hotel

1481
01:11:31,839 --> 01:11:32,351
Modern

1482
01:11:32,863 --> 01:11:33,887
Which is the sort of

1483
01:11:34,655 --> 01:11:35,423
You can't call it

1484
01:11:35,679 --> 01:11:36,447
Metropolis

1485
01:11:36,959 --> 01:11:38,495
More of a city nearby

1486
01:11:40,287 --> 01:11:40,799
And a crop

1487
01:11:41,055 --> 01:11:44,127
Might be in Agoura

1488
01:11:45,919 --> 01:11:46,943
So

1489
01:11:47,967 --> 01:11:49,503
Norton modern

1490
01:11:49,759 --> 01:11:50,527
We stayed there for a week

1491
01:11:50,783 --> 01:11:51,295
Away from

1492
01:11:51,551 --> 01:11:52,831
That was nice

1493
01:11:53,343 --> 01:11:57,695
To get out of there a little bit so we met a guy who works at a coffee shop

1494
01:11:58,207 --> 01:11:59,743
Are we friends

1495
01:12:00,255 --> 01:12:04,863
Go back to the coffee shop and talk to him

1496
01:12:05,631 --> 01:12:09,471
Little bit of a

1497
01:12:09,727 --> 01:12:10,239
Dating Miss

1498
01:12:10,751 --> 01:12:11,775
News 5

1499
01:12:12,031 --> 01:12:12,799
If you wanted to stay in

1500
01:12:13,055 --> 01:12:15,359
InTouch is my email address

1501
01:12:16,895 --> 01:12:17,407
I don't

1502
01:12:17,663 --> 01:12:21,503
I don't know if you're going to be able to call me from

1503
01:12:21,759 --> 01:12:22,271
Right

1504
01:12:22,527 --> 01:12:23,295
And then heater

1505
01:12:23,807 --> 01:12:27,903
Oh no email me I don't know what the deal was there was

1506
01:12:28,159 --> 01:12:29,439
Start of a disconnect but like

1507
01:12:29,951 --> 01:12:30,975
You can do that

1508
01:12:33,023 --> 01:12:39,167
What do you think about that

1509
01:12:42,495 --> 01:12:48,639
Go Buckwild you can have those experiences all day long

1510
01:12:49,151 --> 01:12:50,431
Level

1511
01:12:50,687 --> 01:12:52,223
Or you can f*** around and find

1512
01:12:52,479 --> 01:12:56,063
Some cool underworld bar or something like that needs some weirdos and do heroin

1513
01:12:56,319 --> 01:12:58,111
If you're traveling

1514
01:13:00,927 --> 01:13:05,023
Episode

1515
01:13:05,279 --> 01:13:06,047
Something

1516
01:13:06,303 --> 01:13:09,375
His eyes lit up in such a way that I got caught up in the moment

1517
01:13:09,631 --> 01:13:10,911
Oh my God this man

1518
01:13:11,423 --> 01:13:12,191
Truly is

1519
01:13:14,751 --> 01:13:20,895
Neurons are firing and I feel beauty and then when the episode

1520
01:13:22,431 --> 01:13:23,455
You're f****** millionaire

1521
01:13:23,711 --> 01:13:25,759
Of course you're happy

1522
01:13:26,015 --> 01:13:30,367
What do easy to be happy when you're jet-setting around the world on somebody else's dime

1523
01:13:30,623 --> 01:13:32,671
Well you're also still a millionaire

1524
01:13:32,927 --> 01:13:37,023
That's the problem with the show but I don't see the problem with Phil

1525
01:13:37,279 --> 01:13:41,119
Like I really think that even if he wasn't all that rich he's still be just as happy

1526
01:13:41,375 --> 01:13:43,935
Like his demeanor

1527
01:13:44,191 --> 01:13:47,007
I don't know there's no way to prove a counterfactual

1528
01:13:47,263 --> 01:13:47,775
But like

1529
01:13:48,031 --> 01:13:49,055
I think

1530
01:13:49,311 --> 01:13:51,871
What the thing that draws me to the show is that beautiful

1531
01:13:52,127 --> 01:13:53,151
Love of life

1532
01:13:53,407 --> 01:13:54,175
That he embodies

1533
01:13:55,199 --> 01:13:55,711
Is it really

1534
01:13:56,223 --> 01:13:56,991
There's an innocent

1535
01:13:58,015 --> 01:13:58,527
Great

1536
01:13:58,783 --> 01:14:02,111
But at the same time you can't take class out of it gets really great

1537
01:14:08,767 --> 01:14:11,839
Enough to live and eventually you pay your cards right all this stuff

1538
01:14:12,095 --> 01:14:15,423
Maybe you'll be one of those people who capitalizes all capitalism

1539
01:14:15,679 --> 01:14:18,239
In the same way this show presenter this scenario where it's like

1540
01:14:18,751 --> 01:14:20,031
You can do all this stuff and

1541
01:14:20,287 --> 01:14:20,799
You f****** cam

1542
01:14:21,055 --> 01:14:23,103
Yeah there's just a delusion embedded

1543
01:14:23,615 --> 01:14:25,407
I don't know why

1544
01:14:25,663 --> 01:14:29,247
I just don't want I don't want

1545
01:14:29,503 --> 01:14:30,015
All day today

1546
01:14:30,271 --> 01:14:32,575
We're recording much later than normal

1547
01:14:32,831 --> 01:14:37,439
Sour beer is acting weird but it's growing on me a little bit

1548
01:14:37,695 --> 01:14:38,975
It's kind of

1549
01:14:39,231 --> 01:14:40,511
I don't I still don't love it

1550
01:14:41,023 --> 01:14:42,047
But it's growing on me

1551
01:14:44,351 --> 01:14:45,631
Text a little while

1552
01:14:45,887 --> 01:14:46,911
It's like one of those sour candy

1553
01:14:47,423 --> 01:14:47,935
Yeah

1554
01:14:48,191 --> 01:14:49,215
What are those

1555
01:14:49,471 --> 01:14:51,007
It reminds me of a warhead

1556
01:14:51,263 --> 01:14:52,543
So you kind of kind of grown up

1557
01:14:53,823 --> 01:14:55,615
Grow on you

1558
01:14:56,639 --> 01:14:57,663
Is Alex's neck

1559
01:14:59,199 --> 01:14:59,711
This guy

1560
01:15:02,271 --> 01:15:03,295
We are joined

1561
01:15:03,807 --> 01:15:06,111
By Pastor Logan Robertson

1562
01:15:06,367 --> 01:15:07,391
Nope

1563
01:15:08,159 --> 01:15:14,047
Agreed

1564
01:15:15,071 --> 01:15:18,655
12 years and the Lord blessed him without children

1565
01:15:21,471 --> 01:15:22,751
What's in the news

1566
01:15:32,735 --> 01:15:36,063
Horsford

1567
01:15:41,695 --> 01:15:45,023
He's from New Zealand in Australia

1568
01:15:45,279 --> 01:15:49,631
Started harassing a bunch of Muslims

1569
01:15:49,887 --> 01:15:51,423
Go back to

1570
01:15:52,447 --> 01:15:54,751
And I'm not I'm not

1571
01:15:55,007 --> 01:15:58,079
Tatoosh and slightly better than ours because they do reserve the right to do

1572
01:15:58,335 --> 01:15:59,615
Report people for being a dick

1573
01:15:59,871 --> 01:16:02,175
Here to defend

1574
01:16:02,431 --> 01:16:05,503
Another country's decision about their deportation laws

1575
01:16:06,015 --> 01:16:07,551
I know every country has their to differ

1576
01:16:10,879 --> 01:16:11,647
I will

1577
01:16:12,159 --> 01:16:14,207
Alex ends up playing the video of

1578
01:16:14,463 --> 01:16:15,743
Logan Robertson

1579
01:16:15,999 --> 01:16:19,327
Talking to people outside a mosque

1580
01:16:19,583 --> 01:16:21,631
I certainly don't think he comports himself

1581
01:16:21,887 --> 01:16:25,727
I mean not in the video that he plays but

1582
01:16:25,983 --> 01:16:28,031
Very clearly cop to Call of Duty

1583
01:16:32,383 --> 01:16:34,943
The playground Spider-Man

1584
01:16:35,455 --> 01:16:40,063
Enough to get you deported American music

1585
01:16:42,879 --> 01:16:45,439
Well that happens all the time that I talk to Baron

1586
01:16:47,487 --> 01:16:48,511
Man drops that crepe

1587
01:16:49,535 --> 01:16:50,303
To wrestle with

1588
01:16:50,815 --> 01:16:52,095
We talked about in terms of the United

1589
01:16:52,351 --> 01:16:54,143
Quite a bit because of Tommy Robinson

1590
01:16:55,167 --> 01:16:57,471
Is it Australian Donuts

1591
01:16:57,983 --> 01:16:58,751
Cuz they're different country

1592
01:17:02,591 --> 01:17:05,151
Just to remind all the info Warriors out there

1593
01:17:05,407 --> 01:17:06,431
There are other

1594
01:17:07,199 --> 01:17:08,991
ESPN

1595
01:17:09,247 --> 01:17:11,295
Do Australians already have freedom

1596
01:17:11,551 --> 01:17:12,831
Do they have freedom of speech

1597
01:17:13,087 --> 01:17:16,671
And if so what does that really mean to our day-to-day lives

1598
01:17:17,183 --> 01:17:19,231
Despite all the debate in the past two years by priests

1599
01:17:19,743 --> 01:17:20,511
It's not a right

1600
01:17:20,767 --> 01:17:21,535
Protected under archons

1601
01:17:21,791 --> 01:17:25,375
Institution in fact the only social freedom is guaranteed is religion

1602
01:17:25,887 --> 01:17:27,423
Australia doesn't have a Bill of Rights

1603
01:17:27,679 --> 01:17:29,727
Which is where freedom speech usually gets to find a

1604
01:17:29,983 --> 01:17:31,263
Protected in most western

1605
01:17:31,775 --> 01:17:33,311
It's meter incorporated in

1606
01:17:33,567 --> 01:17:34,335
Any federal

1607
01:17:34,591 --> 01:17:35,615
Legislation

1608
01:17:36,127 --> 01:17:38,431
Free Speech has never been about staying what you want

1609
01:17:38,687 --> 01:17:39,199
Being protective

1610
01:17:39,455 --> 01:17:39,967
From the consequence

1611
01:17:40,223 --> 01:17:40,735
What you say

1612
01:17:41,247 --> 01:17:43,551
Australia does have laws regarding 3

1613
01:17:43,807 --> 01:17:46,111
But they're all concerned with limitation

1614
01:17:47,647 --> 01:17:51,487
Is the position of Australia in terms of their

1615
01:17:51,743 --> 01:17:52,255
Government

1616
01:17:52,767 --> 01:17:53,279
Free speech

1617
01:17:54,303 --> 01:17:55,327
Fairly sensible

1618
01:17:56,863 --> 01:17:59,423
Protections that have come into place through court cases

1619
01:17:59,679 --> 01:18:03,263
About political speech being protected

1620
01:18:03,519 --> 01:18:04,799
So there are there are some

1621
01:18:05,055 --> 01:18:06,591
They're not like

1622
01:18:06,847 --> 01:18:08,383
The same way that we have it embedded in

1623
01:18:11,711 --> 01:18:12,479
It's such a

1624
01:18:12,735 --> 01:18:16,063
Session we have refused to legislated at all

1625
01:18:16,319 --> 01:18:17,343
There's there's a

1626
01:18:18,623 --> 01:18:19,647
Way2go that is

1627
01:18:21,439 --> 01:18:23,743
You don't have to be Australia you don't have

1628
01:18:24,511 --> 01:18:25,279
But you also don't have to

1629
01:18:25,535 --> 01:18:26,815
You know like you

1630
01:18:27,071 --> 01:18:28,351
You shouldn't be

1631
01:18:28,863 --> 01:18:30,911
Feeling on Free Speech

1632
01:18:31,679 --> 01:18:32,703
Ultimately comes down

1633
01:18:32,959 --> 01:18:34,495
Swear jar levels

1634
01:18:35,007 --> 01:18:38,847
I like if you are a dick often enough I reserve the right to

1635
01:18:39,871 --> 01:18:40,383
Like

1636
01:18:42,431 --> 01:18:42,943
Abuser

1637
01:18:44,735 --> 01:18:46,015
Get the f*** out of here

1638
01:18:48,319 --> 01:18:51,391
But if you're just free speech

1639
01:18:51,903 --> 01:18:52,671
Porcupine the line

1640
01:18:52,927 --> 01:18:53,439
I don't know

1641
01:18:57,535 --> 01:18:59,327
Alex

1642
01:19:03,167 --> 01:19:09,055
50 Muslims

1643
01:19:09,311 --> 01:19:11,103
Proves that they are sissies the Muslims

1644
01:19:11,359 --> 01:19:15,199
Because instead of having an interview with us they had to wring the media police

1645
01:19:15,455 --> 01:19:18,271
Just because they don't want their religion exposed for what it is

1646
01:19:19,295 --> 01:19:23,135
So you going around with camera and trying to be like a Muhammad sex with a minor

1647
01:19:25,695 --> 01:19:27,231
Well yeah but so did

1648
01:19:32,351 --> 01:19:33,887
So I don't know man

1649
01:19:38,239 --> 01:19:41,311
F*** a minor

1650
01:19:42,335 --> 01:19:44,639
I think it's behavioral s*** but it

1651
01:19:46,943 --> 01:19:48,223
Have any interest in telling

1652
01:19:48,479 --> 01:19:49,503
Australia what to do

1653
01:19:51,551 --> 01:19:55,135
You guys play by your rules I don't fully understand your government or your

1654
01:19:56,159 --> 01:19:56,927
System

1655
01:19:57,183 --> 01:19:57,951
Your football

1656
01:19:58,207 --> 01:20:00,255
Sure Australian Rules

1657
01:20:01,791 --> 01:20:03,583
So what I do understand is this

1658
01:20:03,839 --> 01:20:06,911
Logan Peterson had the option to appeal his deportation

1659
01:20:07,423 --> 01:20:07,935
But chose not to

1660
01:20:08,703 --> 01:20:09,215
You know why

1661
01:20:09,727 --> 01:20:10,495
Because he knows it is

1662
01:20:10,751 --> 01:20:11,263
Is the best thing that

1663
01:20:11,519 --> 01:20:12,031
Could ever have

1664
01:20:13,311 --> 01:20:15,872
You don't want to do you know on a second train like

1665
01:20:16,128 --> 01:20:21,504
Stan from my rights I'm going to stay here wave the ability to appeal it

1666
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:25,600
Because he wants to be deported to have the victim status

1667
01:20:25,856 --> 01:20:28,672
Alex gets from these slap on the wrist

1668
01:20:28,928 --> 01:20:29,440
Punishments

1669
01:20:29,696 --> 01:20:30,208
Social media

1670
01:20:32,512 --> 01:20:33,024
Bucking

1671
01:20:33,536 --> 01:20:34,304
Conservative

1672
01:20:34,816 --> 01:20:37,120
Weirdo bigot a****** propaganda

1673
01:20:38,144 --> 01:20:38,656
Beg

1674
01:20:39,424 --> 01:20:39,936
To be punished

1675
01:20:40,448 --> 01:20:42,496
Because that validates

1676
01:20:42,752 --> 01:20:43,520
The victim status

1677
01:20:43,776 --> 01:20:45,056
That they've been faking

1678
01:20:45,312 --> 01:20:46,080
The whole time

1679
01:20:46,592 --> 01:20:47,360
So that's

1680
01:20:47,616 --> 01:20:49,408
The same boat that this dick hole is in

1681
01:20:55,040 --> 01:20:57,088
So now Alex is interviewing this guy Logan Peter

1682
01:20:57,856 --> 01:20:59,136
What are things that's really fun

1683
01:20:59,392 --> 01:20:59,904
I think

1684
01:21:00,160 --> 01:21:01,952
The reason I kept this clip-in is

1685
01:21:02,208 --> 01:21:02,976
I mean I say something

1686
01:21:03,232 --> 01:21:04,768
Disgraceful things about Islam

1687
01:21:07,840 --> 01:21:10,400
A little bit but we also get to hear

1688
01:21:10,912 --> 01:21:13,472
You if your Eagle ear listener you'll know that Alex

1689
01:21:13,728 --> 01:21:16,288
Usually has an interview

1690
01:21:16,544 --> 01:21:18,592
And while the other person is talking he's eating lunch

1691
01:21:20,384 --> 01:21:22,944
You can kind of tell here at the beginning of the clip

1692
01:21:23,200 --> 01:21:26,528
Sandwich in konawa

1693
01:21:36,512 --> 01:21:39,584
New Zealand is not as bad but Australia

1694
01:21:39,840 --> 01:21:42,144
Muslims in United

1695
01:21:43,424 --> 01:21:43,936
Frelich

1696
01:21:45,472 --> 01:21:48,544
Al 600,000 Woodlands

1697
01:21:48,800 --> 01:21:50,080
Certainly don't let him in by boat

1698
01:21:50,336 --> 01:21:51,872
That's against the rules in Australia

1699
01:21:52,128 --> 01:21:53,664
In Australia now

1700
01:21:53,920 --> 01:21:56,480
I miss you. Sweeney 24 million people

1701
01:21:56,736 --> 01:22:01,856
And what is increasing Muslim refugees

1702
01:22:02,368 --> 01:22:02,880
And

1703
01:22:03,136 --> 01:22:04,672
Do you mean

1704
01:22:05,184 --> 01:22:07,232
It's pretty much.

1705
01:22:07,488 --> 01:22:08,000
I don't believe you

1706
01:22:11,072 --> 01:22:13,120
Play

1707
01:22:14,912 --> 01:22:21,056
Opera house has to wear a polka

1708
01:22:21,312 --> 01:22:23,104
Cover

1709
01:22:25,408 --> 01:22:28,224
Can't be allowed out there

1710
01:22:28,480 --> 01:22:29,504
Like weird metal tits

1711
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:32,320
I've heard repeatedly

1712
01:22:33,856 --> 01:22:38,720
From folks

1713
01:22:39,232 --> 01:22:43,584
Turnbull prime minister conversation starter

1714
01:22:43,840 --> 01:22:47,168
Australia has a blanket ruler they don't accept people by boat

1715
01:22:47,424 --> 01:22:51,264
So, you show up no matter what your status is they take you

1716
01:22:52,288 --> 01:22:53,312
They're like you have to get out

1717
01:22:56,640 --> 01:22:58,688
You coming here by boat

1718
01:23:00,224 --> 01:23:00,736
While

1719
01:23:02,016 --> 01:23:04,832
Clearly a specific

1720
01:23:06,368 --> 01:23:09,696
Okay never have the conversation

1721
01:23:10,208 --> 01:23:10,976
Fly there

1722
01:23:11,232 --> 01:23:14,048
That suggests you can't afford to fly

1723
01:23:14,304 --> 01:23:17,632
Which means keeping out people who can't afford to fly

1724
01:23:17,888 --> 01:23:19,168
Which is a very specific

1725
01:23:19,424 --> 01:23:20,448
Degrees in to have a

1726
01:23:20,704 --> 01:23:21,984
No boats

1727
01:23:22,240 --> 01:23:26,080
Whitney is fine if you take a trained Australia f*** off

1728
01:23:26,336 --> 01:23:28,896
Legitimately

1729
01:23:29,152 --> 01:23:29,664
Marketing

1730
01:23:33,504 --> 01:23:34,784
I can't argue with it

1731
01:23:36,320 --> 01:23:39,392
If you live in Australia and one of our listeners and you don't like it

1732
01:23:39,904 --> 01:23:41,440
I'll second that that's your business

1733
01:23:41,696 --> 01:23:43,488
Chances are you hate Malcolm Turnbull

1734
01:23:43,744 --> 01:23:46,560
If you if you live in Australia you listen to us

1735
01:23:46,816 --> 01:23:48,352
You are not a fan of your government

1736
01:23:48,864 --> 01:23:50,400
It's possible I don't know

1737
01:23:51,936 --> 01:23:52,448
It's too hot

1738
01:23:52,704 --> 01:23:54,496
Question question here

1739
01:24:07,040 --> 01:24:09,856
I believe there's a lot of people that I

1740
01:24:10,112 --> 01:24:11,392
Waking up to this in

1741
01:24:11,904 --> 01:24:13,952
Hearing the truth about that

1742
01:24:14,208 --> 01:24:16,256
It is wicked false religion

1743
01:24:16,768 --> 01:24:17,280
Sad

1744
01:24:18,560 --> 01:24:22,144
At the moment they might be a little peaceful and now countries but

1745
01:24:22,400 --> 01:24:23,680
When I get in I'm bizarre

1746
01:24:23,936 --> 01:24:25,216
You can say like in England

1747
01:24:25,984 --> 01:24:29,056
They will stop relaxing and never stop.

1748
01:24:29,312 --> 01:24:32,640
It wasn't a problem

1749
01:24:33,152 --> 01:24:33,664
Sure

1750
01:24:34,176 --> 01:24:35,712
That's what the leftist do they mean

1751
01:24:35,968 --> 01:24:36,736
This dude

1752
01:24:37,504 --> 01:24:38,272
Pastor Robert

1753
01:24:40,064 --> 01:24:41,600
F***** up stuff there

1754
01:24:42,112 --> 01:24:42,624
Alex

1755
01:24:42,880 --> 01:24:43,648
His responses

1756
01:24:43,904 --> 01:24:44,416
You bet

1757
01:24:46,464 --> 01:24:46,976
We'll get to that

1758
01:24:49,280 --> 01:24:50,560
Keep calling Pastor Robinson

1759
01:24:50,816 --> 01:24:53,888
And then

1760
01:24:54,144 --> 01:24:56,704
But yeah

1761
01:24:56,960 --> 01:25:00,032
Does he go back to a different I think he might have

1762
01:25:00,288 --> 01:25:01,312
Like a small Church

1763
01:25:01,568 --> 01:25:02,592
Online

1764
01:25:03,360 --> 01:25:04,896
I'm not entirely sure

1765
01:25:05,152 --> 01:25:07,456
Because

1766
01:25:11,296 --> 01:25:11,808
Important

1767
01:25:12,064 --> 01:25:12,576
But first

1768
01:25:12,832 --> 01:25:14,112
I just think

1769
01:25:14,368 --> 01:25:20,512
You know they're putting out is that yes Muslims are fine now but once there's more of them

1770
01:25:20,768 --> 01:25:24,352
Look out witches

1771
01:25:24,608 --> 01:25:27,936
The same like this is a really cancerous piece of rhetoric

1772
01:25:28,192 --> 01:25:29,216
Ditto

1773
01:25:29,984 --> 01:25:30,752
Is encouraged

1774
01:25:32,288 --> 01:25:32,800
Like

1775
01:25:34,848 --> 01:25:38,944
The only thing that people being around

1776
01:25:39,456 --> 01:25:41,248
You can't trust people who are different

1777
01:25:41,504 --> 01:25:44,064
You got it they will always team up together guy

1778
01:25:44,320 --> 01:25:44,832
Which is

1779
01:25:45,088 --> 01:25:46,880
Which is one of the big reasons

1780
01:25:47,136 --> 01:25:48,160
That I

1781
01:25:48,672 --> 01:25:49,184
I am

1782
01:25:49,696 --> 01:25:50,208
Furious

1783
01:25:50,464 --> 01:25:50,976
Add

1784
01:25:52,256 --> 01:25:55,072
For being like well climate change is going to be a problem

1785
01:25:56,352 --> 01:25:57,120
20

1786
01:25:57,376 --> 01:26:00,192
70%

1787
01:26:00,704 --> 01:26:02,496
Every refugee

1788
01:26:02,752 --> 01:26:05,824
The more refugees we have the more destabilize

1789
01:26:06,080 --> 01:26:09,152
Is other countries are because of assholes like this

1790
01:26:11,712 --> 01:26:13,248
Of course you should accept refugees

1791
01:26:13,504 --> 01:26:14,272
Of course

1792
01:26:15,552 --> 01:26:18,112
Fought and clawed and f******

1793
01:26:18,368 --> 01:26:19,136
Everything they could

1794
01:26:19,392 --> 01:26:20,928
To get away from a situation

1795
01:26:21,952 --> 01:26:22,976
Literally died

1796
01:26:23,232 --> 01:26:24,256
And you're like

1797
01:26:24,512 --> 01:26:27,584
You can't let him in because they might change

1798
01:26:28,096 --> 01:26:28,608
No no

1799
01:26:29,120 --> 01:26:29,632
Your playlist

1800
01:26:30,400 --> 01:26:36,544
That's the point

1801
01:26:36,800 --> 01:26:42,688
People that you're actually afraid of because those people are trying to kill

1802
01:26:42,944 --> 01:26:43,712
Latent

1803
01:26:44,992 --> 01:26:49,088
Colonialist feeling within people like Alex and

1804
01:26:50,112 --> 01:26:51,904
These New Zealand

1805
01:26:52,160 --> 01:26:54,208
I was talking about the boat

1806
01:26:54,976 --> 01:26:59,328
Like a feeling of like that's what we would do

1807
01:26:59,584 --> 01:27:02,400
Do you know there is

1808
01:27:02,656 --> 01:27:03,168
Absolutely right

1809
01:27:03,424 --> 01:27:09,568
There's a sense of like if we could get away with doing you Advil all right

1810
01:27:09,824 --> 01:27:15,968
Be afraid of the fact that there's more of them they're going to kill us it's always a battle

1811
01:27:16,224 --> 01:27:17,248
Between people who look

1812
01:27:17,504 --> 01:27:18,528
Always

1813
01:27:18,784 --> 01:27:20,832
Society is always

1814
01:27:21,344 --> 01:27:24,672
Write a blog why are you giving up the presumed advantage

1815
01:27:25,696 --> 01:27:27,744
Imaginary Danger

1816
01:27:29,280 --> 01:27:30,560
Crazy crazy enough

1817
01:27:30,816 --> 01:27:32,352
Imagine if ever go

1818
01:27:32,608 --> 01:27:34,656
Edmond

1819
01:27:34,912 --> 01:27:37,728
People showed up

1820
01:27:37,984 --> 01:27:40,032
We got to get these people out here

1821
01:27:40,288 --> 01:27:42,080
Maybe we have a whole different world

1822
01:27:42,336 --> 01:27:43,616
It seems like it's old school

1823
01:27:45,152 --> 01:27:47,456
A reporter

1824
01:27:51,552 --> 01:27:52,832
Well obviously they do

1825
01:27:54,112 --> 01:27:55,648
Which is Kill Everybody

1826
01:27:56,672 --> 01:27:58,720
As opposed to what they've always

1827
01:27:59,232 --> 01:28:04,096
Except us an Open Arms which is why we're able to kill everybody

1828
01:28:04,608 --> 01:28:07,168
And that's probably where this mentality comes from

1829
01:28:07,424 --> 01:28:09,216
Expressing a great point

1830
01:28:11,008 --> 01:28:11,520
Guys

1831
01:28:14,080 --> 01:28:18,432
Is as bad as any of those videos that got taken down from Alex's Chan

1832
01:28:18,688 --> 01:28:20,480
Right there

1833
01:28:20,992 --> 01:28:21,504
This Gap

1834
01:28:21,760 --> 01:28:23,040
Being allowed to

1835
01:28:24,320 --> 01:28:25,088
What he says

1836
01:28:25,344 --> 01:28:29,440
More Muslims are going to show up and then they're going to start riding oh and then Alex comes in

1837
01:28:29,696 --> 01:28:31,488
The Democrats want them to do that

1838
01:28:31,744 --> 01:28:37,888
Yeah those videos

1839
01:28:42,240 --> 01:28:44,032
And keep posting this f****** videos

1840
01:28:45,312 --> 01:28:45,824
So anyway

1841
01:28:46,848 --> 01:28:47,360
You know

1842
01:28:48,128 --> 01:28:50,688
There's a chance

1843
01:28:54,016 --> 01:28:55,552
You've got all of it wrong about this guy

1844
01:28:56,064 --> 01:28:56,832
Is Pastor Roberts

1845
01:29:08,096 --> 01:29:09,632
He's been misrepresented

1846
01:29:09,888 --> 01:29:10,400
No

1847
01:29:11,168 --> 01:29:13,984
I know zero about the guy and I already disagree

1848
01:29:15,008 --> 01:29:15,776
Do from a 27

1849
01:29:16,032 --> 01:29:17,312
20 nautical New Zealand Herald

1850
01:29:18,336 --> 01:29:24,480
My view on homeowner Ridges at the Bible

1851
01:29:24,736 --> 01:29:29,344
This is going to be a rollercoaster for you this is going to be real rough

1852
01:29:29,600 --> 01:29:31,136
Going to get way worse

1853
01:29:31,904 --> 01:29:38,048
My view on homeowner Ridge is that the Bible never mentions it so I'm not against them getting married Robertson says

1854
01:29:39,584 --> 01:29:43,936
Quote as long as a bullet goes through their head the moment they kiss

1855
01:29:44,960 --> 01:29:47,008
I told you it's a roller-coaster neighbor

1856
01:29:49,824 --> 01:29:54,432
He's fine with them getting married quote as long as a bullet goes through their head the moment they care

1857
01:29:54,688 --> 01:29:58,016
Because that's what it talks about not marriage but homo.

1858
01:29:58,528 --> 01:29:59,040
You know what

1859
01:29:59,552 --> 01:30:00,832
I disagree with

1860
01:30:02,624 --> 01:30:08,768
It's more if you want to go full-on Deuteronomy

1861
01:30:10,304 --> 01:30:11,072
Not the moment they

1862
01:30:11,328 --> 01:30:11,840
Kiss

1863
01:30:12,096 --> 01:30:13,632
But the moment they lay down

1864
01:30:13,888 --> 01:30:14,656
Bed together

1865
01:30:15,168 --> 01:30:21,312
Like a f****** standing up the Bible doesn't say s*** about that really talk about foreplay

1866
01:30:21,568 --> 01:30:25,920
Can blow dude all you sure about that

1867
01:30:26,176 --> 01:30:28,480
Some of these stuff in like the Gnostic scripture

1868
01:30:28,736 --> 01:30:30,528
Dead Sea Scrolls are pretty clear about

1869
01:30:30,784 --> 01:30:32,320
Where you can put

1870
01:30:32,576 --> 01:30:34,112
You know it's

1871
01:30:34,624 --> 01:30:36,160
Odin

1872
01:30:37,696 --> 01:30:38,208
Stephen Curry

1873
01:30:43,328 --> 01:30:44,352
Muslims

1874
01:30:45,120 --> 01:30:45,632
Kind of fun

1875
01:30:46,912 --> 01:30:53,056
This thing that's cool whatever I'm going to get talked more about how how awful Logan Robertson is

1876
01:30:55,104 --> 01:30:57,920
So there's this writer named Marjorie

1877
01:30:58,688 --> 01:31:03,296
In the book about his struggle with his sexuality as a member of a fundamentalist Church

1878
01:31:03,808 --> 01:31:07,648
Written this book as a way to try and help people who are in a similar position

1879
01:31:07,904 --> 01:31:14,048
I'm also sort of resources and support group

1880
01:31:14,304 --> 01:31:19,168
Because before

1881
01:31:19,680 --> 01:31:22,240
He's been married for an hour

1882
01:31:22,496 --> 01:31:25,824
His wife passed away and after that point you realize what am I struggling a

1883
01:31:26,592 --> 01:31:29,920
Not going away wrote This Book

1884
01:31:30,432 --> 01:31:33,504
Help people who are

1885
01:31:33,760 --> 01:31:34,528
Which I assume

1886
01:31:34,784 --> 01:31:35,808
Punished by the

1887
01:31:37,088 --> 01:31:39,392
So he reached out to a bunch of churches means

1888
01:31:39,648 --> 01:31:41,696
Promoting his book

1889
01:31:44,768 --> 01:31:46,048
Unfortunately Robertson

1890
01:31:46,560 --> 01:31:47,840
Received a message

1891
01:31:48,864 --> 01:31:51,424
From a 2014 article in the New Zealand Herald

1892
01:31:51,680 --> 01:31:54,496
Old Robertson's response email

1893
01:31:54,752 --> 01:31:57,312
We are not interested in your filthy lifestyler book

1894
01:31:57,568 --> 01:31:59,360
The Bible says your vile strain

1895
01:31:59,616 --> 01:32:00,384
Queer reprobate

1896
01:32:00,640 --> 01:32:02,688
Phil sodomite natural brute beasts

1897
01:32:02,944 --> 01:32:03,968
Made to be taken into

1898
01:32:04,224 --> 01:32:06,784
Destroyed I pray that you commit suicide you filthy

1899
01:32:07,040 --> 01:32:07,552
The child molester

1900
01:32:07,808 --> 01:32:08,320
Things bag

1901
01:32:11,136 --> 01:32:11,904
That was published

1902
01:32:13,952 --> 01:32:17,536
His response

1903
01:32:23,680 --> 01:32:26,752
That was his response this guy is a f****** a******

1904
01:32:27,008 --> 01:32:29,056
There's a monster interesting distinct

1905
01:32:31,104 --> 01:32:31,616
Monster

1906
01:32:32,384 --> 01:32:33,408
Music horrible

1907
01:32:33,664 --> 01:32:34,176
Portable

1908
01:32:34,688 --> 01:32:35,200
Yeah

1909
01:32:36,224 --> 01:32:36,736
So

1910
01:32:36,992 --> 01:32:39,552
Baptist Churches of us isolated

1911
01:32:39,808 --> 01:32:40,576
In the event

1912
01:32:43,648 --> 01:32:45,184
New Zealand

1913
01:32:45,440 --> 01:32:46,976
Good thing it's over there

1914
01:32:49,024 --> 01:32:55,168
So this is all against represent

1915
01:32:55,424 --> 01:32:56,960
Just said the following about Logan Roberts

1916
01:32:57,216 --> 01:32:57,728
Quotes

1917
01:32:57,984 --> 01:33:04,128
F*** that guy the Baptist churches in Brazil Android no way connected with or affirm in any way the comments made by

1918
01:33:04,384 --> 01:33:07,712
Self-proclaimed Pastor Logan Robertson of Westside Baptist

1919
01:33:07,968 --> 01:33:08,736
Bible Baptist

1920
01:33:09,248 --> 01:33:12,320
The New Zealand Baptist Union of churches are appalled by the comments

1921
01:33:12,576 --> 01:33:14,368
The Patriot of evil made by Pastor Robertson

1922
01:33:14,880 --> 01:33:16,928
Unfortunately the Baptist name is not a franchise

1923
01:33:17,440 --> 01:33:19,744
The name to be taken by any group or person that wishes

1924
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:20,512
Use this long

1925
01:33:22,816 --> 01:33:24,608
In case of Pastor Logan Robertson

1926
01:33:24,864 --> 01:33:27,680
He's not an ordained or register pastor of any denomination

1927
01:33:28,192 --> 01:33:30,752
Do you not have a congregation or church building or meeting space

1928
01:33:31,264 --> 01:33:34,336
He's established a Church website there by claiming to be a church

1929
01:33:34,592 --> 01:33:35,872
Therefore his desire to conquer

1930
01:33:36,128 --> 01:33:36,640
The pastor is

1931
01:33:36,896 --> 01:33:37,664
Entirely fragile

1932
01:33:38,944 --> 01:33:41,504
2014 is a chance that he established

1933
01:33:43,040 --> 01:33:44,832
Also I don't believe you

1934
01:33:45,088 --> 01:33:46,112
Except if it's like I'm more.

1935
01:33:46,624 --> 01:33:47,904
Like I'm ordained by the new life

1936
01:33:51,488 --> 01:33:52,000
It really

1937
01:33:52,512 --> 01:33:55,584
Luggage

1938
01:33:56,096 --> 01:33:59,680
If you go to Seminary just like read the Bible and then your

1939
01:34:05,056 --> 01:34:05,824
It's like passing

1940
01:34:08,128 --> 01:34:11,712
It's like going to a real life Hogwarts in them being like

1941
01:34:11,968 --> 01:34:14,784
You know the difference I would say is very real

1942
01:34:15,296 --> 01:34:15,808
Level up

1943
01:34:16,576 --> 01:34:17,088
That's fair

1944
01:34:17,344 --> 01:34:21,696
If you go through the work that you have to take years of classes and Seminary in order to

1945
01:34:23,488 --> 01:34:24,000
Mean it

1946
01:34:24,256 --> 01:34:25,792
Yeah where is a like

1947
01:34:26,048 --> 01:34:28,864
Now f*** it I'm a pastor now 8 suck

1948
01:34:36,288 --> 01:34:36,800
You don't mean it

1949
01:34:37,056 --> 01:34:37,568
You're just

1950
01:34:37,824 --> 01:34:38,848
You're looking for a space

1951
01:34:39,104 --> 01:34:39,872
Got nothing

1952
01:34:42,944 --> 01:34:45,760
Hello hate preacher and

1953
01:34:46,272 --> 01:34:50,880
Past Infowars gas to his

1954
01:34:51,136 --> 01:34:57,024
Steve Anderson who we went over in episode

1955
01:34:57,280 --> 01:34:58,048
Open 2016

1956
01:34:58,560 --> 01:35:00,864
He wrote The Following about it in his blog

1957
01:35:01,120 --> 01:35:04,960
We had a full house again for the Saturday preaching service and Pastor Logan Robertson

1958
01:35:05,216 --> 01:35:06,496
Preach the short sermon on quote

1959
01:35:06,752 --> 01:35:08,032
How to be filled with the spirit

1960
01:35:08,288 --> 01:35:12,384
He preached his drinking and didn't hold anything back when he called out YouTubers

1961
01:35:12,640 --> 01:35:13,920
Marshall

1962
01:35:14,176 --> 01:35:15,968
Are there bizarre teaching on alcohol

1963
01:35:16,480 --> 01:35:18,272
Not only that but hearing Pastor Roberts

1964
01:35:18,784 --> 01:35:21,344
We're in a New Zealand accent

1965
01:35:23,392 --> 01:35:24,928
What a load of assholes

1966
01:35:26,208 --> 01:35:28,512
I don't think that anybody is misrepresenting

1967
01:35:29,024 --> 01:35:29,536
Mister Roberts

1968
01:35:30,048 --> 01:35:30,560
Robertson

1969
01:35:31,584 --> 01:35:32,096
You the f****** mods

1970
01:35:32,608 --> 01:35:34,912

1973
01:35:42,336 --> 01:35:46,176
So now I'm Alex plays the clip of him harassing most

1974
01:35:48,480 --> 01:35:48,992
To display this

1975
01:35:49,504 --> 01:35:50,528
Let you respond

1976
01:35:51,296 --> 01:35:52,064
If you

1977
01:35:53,088 --> 01:35:53,600
You say that

1978
01:35:53,856 --> 01:35:55,136
I know I'm not going to feel good

1979
01:35:55,392 --> 01:35:59,744
Well I don't know if you'll feel terrible much going on here

1980
01:36:02,048 --> 01:36:02,816
I think

1981
01:36:03,072 --> 01:36:04,352
There's adults respond

1982
01:36:04,608 --> 01:36:05,632
To a child with a k

1983
01:36:06,400 --> 01:36:07,424
His kind of what's going on

1984
01:36:07,680 --> 01:36:09,984
Alright let's not go ahead and finish up with this club

1985
01:36:36,608 --> 01:36:42,752
Call D'Amico

1986
01:36:43,264 --> 01:36:43,776
He dead

1987
01:37:12,448 --> 01:37:14,496
Why are you saying varidirect

1988
01:37:15,008 --> 01:37:15,520
Sure

1989
01:37:16,032 --> 01:37:18,848
There's nothing about this mosque but anyway like

1990
01:37:19,104 --> 01:37:20,384
They're harboring terrorists

1991
01:37:20,640 --> 01:37:21,664
Then we suspect

1992
01:37:22,432 --> 01:37:23,456
They're not even saying

1993
01:37:25,248 --> 01:37:25,760
Muslim

1994
01:37:27,040 --> 01:37:28,064
That's all of this is

1995
01:37:28,576 --> 01:37:31,392
There's nothing going on here that like we're going to make it

1996
01:37:31,648 --> 01:37:33,440
Expose documentary about something

1997
01:37:33,696 --> 01:37:34,720
Other than

1998
01:37:34,976 --> 01:37:38,048
How many only thing that's revealed is I f****** hate Muslim

1999
01:37:38,560 --> 01:37:43,168
That's the only thing that Robertson is revealing anyway

2000
01:37:44,192 --> 01:37:48,032
Are they making a documentary about something

2001
01:37:48,288 --> 01:37:54,432
Like specific Muslims

2002
01:37:54,688 --> 01:37:55,712
Muhammad

2003
01:37:57,504 --> 01:37:58,016
Documentary

2004
01:37:58,272 --> 01:38:00,064
Where in Vegas

2005
01:38:00,832 --> 01:38:04,928
That has nobody affiliated with it that has knowledge

2006
01:38:05,184 --> 01:38:08,256
Nobody

2007
01:38:08,768 --> 01:38:13,376
Nobody nobody doing or saying anything other than just like Bean Ahmad

2008
01:38:13,632 --> 01:38:16,192
A mosque

2009
01:38:16,448 --> 01:38:17,472
And knocked on the door

2010
01:38:17,984 --> 01:38:18,752
And said we hate you

2011
01:38:20,800 --> 01:38:21,568
Yeah

2012
01:38:22,080 --> 01:38:23,616
They probably call him a terrorist

2013
01:38:24,128 --> 01:38:26,176
I mean like really

2014
01:38:26,432 --> 01:38:28,736
If we wanted really slice through the b*******

2015
01:38:28,992 --> 01:38:30,016
Tommy Robinson

2016
01:38:30,272 --> 01:38:31,040
In prison

2017
01:38:31,296 --> 01:38:32,576
Meet another guy with an axe

2018
01:38:33,344 --> 01:38:39,488
That's what's going on here and he's got to go to the bank

2019
01:38:39,744 --> 01:38:40,256
Who hates Muslim

2020
01:38:40,512 --> 01:38:42,048
Detroit

2021
01:38:42,304 --> 01:38:44,352
Some contemporaries in the UK and none of them had

2022
01:38:44,864 --> 01:38:47,936
Not committed enough to

2023
01:38:49,984 --> 01:38:51,776
This guy has

2024
01:38:52,032 --> 01:38:53,312
Committed a lot of time

2025
01:38:53,568 --> 01:38:56,384
2014

2026
01:38:56,640 --> 01:38:58,688
To be an Infowars Gaston

2027
01:39:01,248 --> 01:39:01,760
I meant look

2028
01:39:03,296 --> 01:39:04,064
Jamaican Jah Cure

2029
01:39:04,832 --> 01:39:05,600
I don't believe you

2030
01:39:05,856 --> 01:39:07,136
You're agitating

2031
01:39:07,648 --> 01:39:10,720
We're trying to create like you're trying to do a jackass

2032
01:39:12,768 --> 01:39:13,536
Pissing off

2033
01:39:15,328 --> 01:39:16,608
And when you say things like

2034
01:39:16,864 --> 01:39:17,632
In this next clip

2035
01:39:17,888 --> 01:39:18,656
I really don't think

2036
01:39:21,984 --> 01:39:23,520
You're not even for Europeans now

2037
01:39:26,336 --> 01:39:30,432
Madewell

2038
01:39:38,880 --> 01:39:40,416
I don't understand what you're saying

2039
01:39:41,440 --> 01:39:42,720
Hundred million people

2040
01:39:43,232 --> 01:39:44,000
Is Ludacris

2041
01:39:44,768 --> 01:39:46,304
What did he say 600 million

2042
01:39:46,560 --> 01:39:51,168
600 million people

2043
01:39:51,424 --> 01:39:52,960
Because I

2044
01:39:53,472 --> 01:39:53,984
Thousand

2045
01:39:54,240 --> 01:39:56,288
Cuz that seemed almost like

2046
01:39:56,544 --> 01:39:57,824
No go back

2047
01:39:58,080 --> 01:39:58,592
Yeah

2048
01:39:59,872 --> 01:40:02,176
600 million

2049
01:40:06,528 --> 01:40:10,368
The UN just called for 1/10 of the world's population

2050
01:40:10,624 --> 01:40:12,672
Move to the United States

2051
01:40:12,928 --> 01:40:14,976
Triple the population of the United States

2052
01:40:16,256 --> 01:40:20,608
Do you empty just put out an estimate

2053
01:40:20,864 --> 01:40:23,936
The u.s. building

2054
01:40:24,192 --> 01:40:24,704
Housing

2055
01:40:27,520 --> 01:40:28,800
Use some of this on use land

2056
01:40:30,080 --> 01:40:30,592
DM

2057
01:40:30,848 --> 01:40:32,640
Do you want to put out an estimate of likes

2058
01:40:32,896 --> 01:40:33,920
68 million people were

2059
01:40:34,176 --> 01:40:34,944
Displaced in

2060
01:40:35,200 --> 01:40:35,968
2000

2061
01:40:36,992 --> 01:40:38,528
So what I think Alex is doing is a

2062
01:40:38,784 --> 01:40:39,552
Assuming that means

2063
01:40:39,808 --> 01:40:41,344
They want us to take them all

2064
01:40:41,600 --> 01:40:45,440
Protect ears

2065
01:40:45,696 --> 01:40:46,976
I think that's what he's doing

2066
01:40:47,488 --> 01:40:51,584
But I don't know what you're giving him a lot of credit for me and I just

2067
01:40:52,096 --> 01:40:58,240
Cuz I looked for 600 million people to the United States all sorts of combinations are worth

2068
01:40:58,496 --> 01:41:00,288
Couldn't find anything other than

2069
01:41:02,080 --> 01:41:06,432
68 million people were displaced 2017

2070
01:41:06,688 --> 01:41:07,968
Try and figure out what

2071
01:41:08,224 --> 01:41:10,272
The war propaganda math of this

2072
01:41:10,528 --> 01:41:11,296
That's the only thing I

2073
01:41:11,552 --> 01:41:13,600
I know

2074
01:41:15,392 --> 01:41:15,904
Preaching that

2075
01:41:16,672 --> 01:41:18,720
That's absurd

2076
01:41:19,744 --> 01:41:20,256
Even

2077
01:41:20,768 --> 01:41:22,048
The most ardent

2078
01:41:22,304 --> 01:41:23,328
People who are like

2079
01:41:23,584 --> 01:41:24,608
Let's pick folks in

2080
01:41:25,376 --> 01:41:29,984
Let's bring in 600

2081
01:41:32,288 --> 01:41:33,312
We should not borders

2082
01:41:33,568 --> 01:41:34,336
But when you say so

2083
01:41:34,592 --> 01:41:37,408
600 million people should come to the United States

2084
01:41:38,944 --> 01:41:39,968
Might be too much

2085
01:41:41,760 --> 01:41:42,272
Mystikal

2086
01:41:43,296 --> 01:41:44,576
I don't think we have the carrying

2087
01:41:44,832 --> 01:41:49,184
Capacity for that within our economy within our just our infrastructure

2088
01:41:49,440 --> 01:41:53,792
We can carry a lot more than we are

2089
01:41:54,048 --> 01:41:56,096
Easy animal Nebraska

2090
01:41:57,632 --> 01:42:00,192
How many things you need to do in order to accommodate

2091
01:42:00,704 --> 01:42:01,216
Possible

2092
01:42:01,472 --> 01:42:03,008
What is almost impossible

2093
01:42:03,264 --> 01:42:04,800
Two senators from Nebraska

2094
01:42:06,080 --> 01:42:06,848
400

2095
01:42:07,104 --> 01:42:08,128
50 house represent

2096
01:42:09,152 --> 01:42:10,944
I want all six hundred million

2097
01:42:12,224 --> 01:42:13,504
And I want to make sure that they

2098
01:42:13,760 --> 01:42:15,296
Control every voting block east

2099
01:42:17,600 --> 01:42:21,696
It's a wild wild propaganda lines that I just

2100
01:42:21,952 --> 01:42:24,256
The Electoral College would get real weird

2101
01:42:26,048 --> 01:42:30,144
So Alex made a prediction on the Thursday show that General Kelly

2102
01:42:30,400 --> 01:42:30,912
Going to get fired

2103
01:42:31,936 --> 01:42:33,216
So we can look for that

2104
01:42:35,264 --> 01:42:37,056
Next clip makes another prediction

2105
01:42:39,872 --> 01:42:40,384
You know it

2106
01:42:42,176 --> 01:42:44,992
It is all being planned towards this fall

2107
01:42:45,248 --> 01:42:48,576
Big Chrysler Chantilly want to send for those of us to reach pausing it

2108
01:42:49,344 --> 01:42:50,112
The fall of Rage

2109
01:42:50,368 --> 01:42:50,880
Just drag

2110
01:42:51,648 --> 01:42:54,208
Do you know this prediction we've heard it a million times

2111
01:42:55,488 --> 01:43:01,632
He was predicting the summer of Rage in 2018 were already at the end of July

2112
01:43:02,144 --> 01:43:02,656
Me too exciting

2113
01:43:03,168 --> 01:43:03,936
Fall of Rain

2114
01:43:04,192 --> 01:43:06,496
We've also seen over the course of years

2115
01:43:06,752 --> 01:43:07,776
Summer is

2116
01:43:08,032 --> 01:43:10,592
Waiting on the ground this winter is going to be f***** up

2117
01:43:10,848 --> 01:43:13,152
Well it's going to actually just be the winter of our

2118
01:43:13,664 --> 01:43:14,688
Content it's not really going to

2119
01:43:14,944 --> 01:43:16,224
More like

2120
01:43:17,248 --> 01:43:18,272
Always something

2121
01:43:18,528 --> 01:43:19,552
It's always just around

2122
01:43:20,832 --> 01:43:23,136
Just want to take place of the country music

2123
01:43:26,720 --> 01:43:32,352
Just getting them was the beginning of the

2124
01:43:34,144 --> 01:43:35,168
The victory was it again

2125
01:43:37,472 --> 01:43:41,568
And it's very sad to watch him

2126
01:43:41,824 --> 01:43:46,176
California

2127
01:43:51,808 --> 01:43:54,624
Country they want to be part of

2128
01:43:54,880 --> 01:43:56,672
Is the mind control

2129
01:44:02,816 --> 01:44:05,632
Pretty smooth krill oil

2130
01:44:05,888 --> 01:44:06,400
Pornography

2131
01:44:06,656 --> 01:44:07,168
Fish oil

2132
01:44:12,288 --> 01:44:13,568
I don't know what he thinks he

2133
01:44:13,824 --> 01:44:14,336
He's selling

2134
01:44:14,592 --> 01:44:15,616
Play silence bulshit

2135
01:44:17,408 --> 01:44:19,968
I don't know when you put those two words together with

2136
01:44:22,528 --> 01:44:27,136
Brain function

2137
01:44:27,904 --> 01:44:29,184
You take krill oil you be able to

2138
01:44:29,440 --> 01:44:30,464
Sing like a whale

2139
01:44:30,976 --> 01:44:37,120
I don't know man but sounds right I just love that I buy that

2140
01:44:37,376 --> 01:44:38,656
The raises hold on we got to stay

2141
01:44:39,424 --> 01:44:44,032
Cuz he heard that music coming to break

2142
01:44:44,288 --> 01:44:47,104
Break some kids neck

2143
01:44:47,360 --> 01:44:49,152
That was harsh

2144
01:44:49,408 --> 01:44:50,176
Questlove

2145
01:44:52,224 --> 01:44:52,992
I can't get enough of that

2146
01:44:53,504 --> 01:44:57,856
Do an episode with Jess

2147
01:44:59,392 --> 01:44:59,904
Gravis

2148
01:45:00,160 --> 01:45:02,720
Betty of a a gravid Marriott

2149
01:45:03,232 --> 01:45:04,512
Just going to roll with

2150
01:45:04,768 --> 01:45:09,120
The problem is

2151
01:45:09,376 --> 01:45:13,728
How many words do we heard all of them

2152
01:45:14,240 --> 01:45:17,568
How many is hundreds of them in my tablet

2153
01:45:17,824 --> 01:45:18,336
To do that

2154
01:45:18,592 --> 01:45:19,104
You would not be

2155
01:45:20,128 --> 01:45:21,920
Orcas

2156
01:45:30,368 --> 01:45:34,464
Can you gameshare with Alex Jones

2157
01:45:36,256 --> 01:45:40,352
24-second sorry about so

2158
01:45:41,376 --> 01:45:41,888
I don't know

2159
01:45:43,168 --> 01:45:44,192
But it is what it is

2160
01:45:46,240 --> 01:45:47,520
Standard as Alex

2161
01:45:48,032 --> 01:45:50,592
Prime

2162
01:45:50,848 --> 01:45:51,616
If you're going and then

2163
01:45:51,872 --> 01:45:52,896
Really hard at

2164
01:45:53,408 --> 01:45:54,176
We haven't been

2165
01:45:54,432 --> 01:45:55,200
In the present day without

2166
01:45:56,480 --> 01:45:57,504
To the point where

2167
01:45:57,760 --> 01:45:58,272
Going back in

2168
01:46:01,600 --> 01:46:03,648
True will find a way around

2169
01:46:05,952 --> 01:46:06,464
We haven't

2170
01:46:06,976 --> 01:46:07,488
Seem like

2171
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:10,048
Lincoln 2009

2172
01:46:10,560 --> 01:46:12,096
Jim Bakker in

2173
01:46:12,608 --> 01:46:13,376
Doing a lot of

2174
01:46:13,632 --> 01:46:14,144
Different things

2175
01:46:14,400 --> 01:46:14,912
But when you go in

2176
01:46:15,168 --> 01:46:16,192
Present-day Alex

2177
01:46:16,704 --> 01:46:17,472
The race

2178
01:46:19,008 --> 01:46:23,104
Very very it's not

2179
01:46:23,360 --> 01:46:26,176
It's not jog weekly it's literally just

2180
01:46:26,688 --> 01:46:28,224
We can't let Brown pee

2181
01:46:28,480 --> 01:46:28,992
People in

2182
01:46:29,248 --> 01:46:31,552
We're afraid that

2183
01:46:31,808 --> 01:46:32,832
People will be

2184
01:46:33,088 --> 01:46:38,464
And there's almost an implication through like the

2185
01:46:38,976 --> 01:46:43,840
Like the globalist and the Liberals brainwashed minority population

2186
01:46:44,096 --> 01:46:47,424
But there's also a kernel of it is like we were stupid

2187
01:46:47,680 --> 01:46:52,800
Begin was absolutely there is a feeling of we've already gone too far

2188
01:46:53,056 --> 01:46:56,640
Side effects

2189
01:46:56,896 --> 01:46:58,432
That's not even America

2190
01:46:58,688 --> 01:46:59,456
It's

2191
01:46:59,712 --> 01:47:01,248
UCare

2192
01:47:02,784 --> 01:47:04,320
Yeah it's

2193
01:47:04,576 --> 01:47:05,088
It's it's

2194
01:47:06,368 --> 01:47:07,136
It's hard

2195
01:47:07,392 --> 01:47:07,904
It's hard to listen

2196
01:47:08,416 --> 01:47:10,464
A lot of levels because

2197
01:47:12,256 --> 01:47:13,792
Sure he's not dropping at

2198
01:47:14,304 --> 01:47:17,376
You know he's not saying I hate black people

2199
01:47:17,632 --> 01:47:19,680
Anything like that but everything

2200
01:47:19,936 --> 01:47:20,960
Almost everything you say

2201
01:47:21,216 --> 01:47:21,984
Legitimately

2202
01:47:23,264 --> 01:47:24,032
Darkly

2203
01:47:24,288 --> 01:47:25,056
Deeply race

2204
01:47:26,592 --> 01:47:27,104
Yeah

2205
01:47:30,432 --> 01:47:31,456
Stupid

2206
01:47:31,968 --> 01:47:34,528
This is another piece of

2207
01:47:34,784 --> 01:47:37,600
Like some of the danger of kicking him off of

2208
01:47:37,856 --> 01:47:38,368
The flats

2209
01:47:39,648 --> 01:47:42,208
And it's another further danger of giving him a super

2210
01:47:42,464 --> 01:47:42,976
Professional

2211
01:47:43,232 --> 01:47:44,000
Lame

2212
01:47:44,512 --> 01:47:47,072
Is that what you end up doing is driving

2213
01:47:47,328 --> 01:47:48,096
Further towards

2214
01:47:48,608 --> 01:47:50,144
The worst part of what you already

2215
01:47:50,656 --> 01:47:54,240
Yeah because if he does end up getting kicked off Alexa YouTuber Facebook

2216
01:47:54,496 --> 01:47:55,264
Permanently

2217
01:47:55,776 --> 01:47:57,056
Nothing is no f******

2218
01:47:57,312 --> 01:47:58,080
Skin in the game

2219
01:47:58,336 --> 01:47:59,104
Let's

2220
01:47:59,360 --> 01:48:02,176
Does make all his money off selling his own problems

2221
01:48:02,432 --> 01:48:03,712
Whatever

2222
01:48:03,968 --> 01:48:05,248
To really worry about any of that

2223
01:48:05,760 --> 01:48:06,528
So why wouldn't he

2224
01:48:06,784 --> 01:48:07,296
Even

2225
01:48:07,552 --> 01:48:08,832
Further down the white National

2226
01:48:09,600 --> 01:48:10,624
Like why wouldn't he

2227
01:48:10,880 --> 01:48:12,416
Cuz he's all he's already

2228
01:48:12,928 --> 01:48:14,464
Very obviously that guy

2229
01:48:14,720 --> 01:48:16,512
Yeah and has been for a long time

2230
01:48:16,768 --> 01:48:19,072
Perhaps the only thing that's keeping him from being

2231
01:48:19,328 --> 01:48:24,192
Looking out right David Duke type Persona is the fear of losing his social media

2232
01:48:24,704 --> 01:48:29,312
You get to see the math drop-in be like

2233
01:48:29,568 --> 01:48:30,336
Look

2234
01:48:30,592 --> 01:48:32,896
Hamstrung by social media for a long time

2235
01:48:33,152 --> 01:48:36,480
I've been trying to make it clear but I haven't been able to look

2236
01:48:36,992 --> 01:48:37,760
This is a white country

2237
01:48:39,296 --> 01:48:40,320
That is what I care about

2238
01:48:40,832 --> 01:48:41,344
But I think

2239
01:48:41,600 --> 01:48:42,880
You hit the nail on the head

2240
01:48:43,136 --> 01:48:45,440
Earlier that those

2241
01:48:46,208 --> 01:48:46,720
Places

2242
01:48:48,256 --> 01:48:48,768
By definition

2243
01:48:50,304 --> 01:48:51,328
Sorry that you're not going

2244
01:48:51,584 --> 01:48:52,608
To get the same audio

2245
01:48:54,400 --> 01:48:55,424
Be kicked off of you to

2246
01:48:56,448 --> 01:48:57,216
Because

2247
01:48:58,496 --> 01:48:59,008
Even if he

2248
01:48:59,264 --> 01:49:00,288
He does still survive

2249
01:49:00,800 --> 01:49:01,824
His Revenue will go

2250
01:49:03,360 --> 01:49:05,664
Unless there is a dark money

2251
01:49:05,920 --> 01:49:06,432
And that sort of thing

2252
01:49:06,688 --> 01:49:08,224
And who knows if that kind of thing

2253
01:49:08,480 --> 01:49:09,760
Is not going to leave

2254
01:49:10,016 --> 01:49:12,576
But money is there money isn't

2255
01:49:13,088 --> 01:49:14,368
Interested in

2256
01:49:14,624 --> 01:49:15,136
Stormfront

2257
01:49:22,560 --> 01:49:23,584
On YouTube and Facebook

2258
01:49:23,840 --> 01:49:25,632
Here's what you're not taking into account

2259
01:49:25,888 --> 01:49:27,424
Is that world

2260
01:49:29,216 --> 01:49:31,264
Bees are always a factor that you forget

2261
01:49:31,520 --> 01:49:32,032
My girl

2262
01:49:32,288 --> 01:49:36,384
You're not taking into account is that world

2263
01:49:37,152 --> 01:49:39,968
The storm frightworld the Gap world

2264
01:49:41,504 --> 01:49:42,272
What's a wack

2265
01:49:43,296 --> 01:49:43,808
Chiefly

2266
01:49:44,064 --> 01:49:44,576
Is

2267
01:49:45,088 --> 01:49:46,624
A really charismatic

2268
01:49:46,880 --> 01:49:47,392
Frontman

2269
01:49:48,160 --> 01:49:50,976
And if Alex gets pushed into a corner

2270
01:49:51,744 --> 01:49:53,536
You could just go to drop all pretense

2271
01:49:54,048 --> 01:49:54,560
And be that

2272
01:49:55,072 --> 01:49:56,864
David Duke doesn't even really have

2273
01:49:57,120 --> 01:49:58,400
The Charisma than Alex Jones

2274
01:49:58,912 --> 01:50:02,496
But Alex Jones could present if

2275
01:50:02,752 --> 01:50:05,568
Do you have to act like he didn't have those things to worry about

2276
01:50:06,080 --> 01:50:08,128
But imagine a scenario where

2277
01:50:08,640 --> 01:50:11,200
But he loses his kid

2278
01:50:11,456 --> 01:50:13,248
Whatever pretext

2279
01:50:13,504 --> 01:50:14,272
Theater is Waco

2280
01:50:14,528 --> 01:50:15,296
But

2281
01:50:15,808 --> 01:50:21,184
Or just a rhetorical situation where he ends up losing

2282
01:50:21,440 --> 01:50:22,208
Custody of

2283
01:50:22,976 --> 01:50:24,000
At the same time music

2284
01:50:24,256 --> 01:50:25,024
Kicked off social media

2285
01:50:25,280 --> 01:50:26,816
It rained in the rhetoric

2286
01:50:27,072 --> 01:50:27,840
Rick to some extent

2287
01:50:28,096 --> 01:50:28,608
You could

2288
01:50:28,864 --> 01:50:30,656
You come go hog-wild into just

2289
01:50:30,912 --> 01:50:31,680
Becoming the next

2290
01:50:31,936 --> 01:50:36,032
Metzger your leader of the white nationalist movement

2291
01:50:36,544 --> 01:50:37,056
You could

2292
01:50:42,432 --> 01:50:46,528
Bald dude

2293
01:50:47,040 --> 01:50:48,064
Via VIA

2294
01:50:50,112 --> 01:50:53,440
Sincerely the past that it would go down but it's really dangerous possibility

2295
01:50:53,952 --> 01:50:54,464
Because

2296
01:50:55,744 --> 01:50:56,256
You know

2297
01:50:56,512 --> 01:50:57,280
Harris Road

2298
01:50:57,792 --> 01:50:58,304
Great movie

2299
01:50:59,328 --> 01:50:59,840
Propaganda

2300
01:51:02,400 --> 01:51:02,912
Nothing to lose

2301
01:51:03,168 --> 01:51:03,680
Right

2302
01:51:03,936 --> 01:51:04,704
Find music

2303
01:51:04,960 --> 01:51:05,472
Status

2304
01:51:05,728 --> 01:51:08,032
Build it eventually into a thing that

2305
01:51:08,288 --> 01:51:08,800
Hanabi

2306
01:51:09,568 --> 01:51:11,616
Eventually the movement goes outside of her

2307
01:51:12,640 --> 01:51:13,152
He has a chain

2308
01:51:13,920 --> 01:51:14,944
Tries to fight back

2309
01:51:15,200 --> 01:51:15,712
Is then

2310
01:51:15,968 --> 01:51:16,480
Cannibalized

2311
01:51:16,992 --> 01:51:17,760
His own movement

2312
01:51:18,272 --> 01:51:19,040
His Redemption

2313
01:51:19,296 --> 01:51:19,808
Ark

2314
01:51:21,856 --> 01:51:26,720
Doesn't exist

2315
01:51:27,744 --> 01:51:30,560
Salt sounds India's hell

2316
01:51:30,816 --> 01:51:32,608
I don't know man

2317
01:51:32,864 --> 01:51:36,448
Most likely outcome but it's definitely one I see as being like

2318
01:51:36,960 --> 01:51:38,752
Opossum certainly

2319
01:51:39,264 --> 01:51:40,800
Logistically possible given the

2320
01:51:41,056 --> 01:51:41,568
The players

2321
01:51:41,824 --> 01:51:42,592
Giving dependents

2322
01:51:42,848 --> 01:51:47,200
I don't know for sure who knows what tomorrow will bring

2323
01:51:47,712 --> 01:51:48,224
Who knows

2324
01:51:48,480 --> 01:51:50,016
So we got a couple more clips left

2325
01:51:52,832 --> 01:51:53,856
Good health Ranger

2326
01:51:54,624 --> 01:51:55,136
Like Adam

2327
01:51:55,392 --> 01:51:56,416
I cannot believe

2328
01:51:57,696 --> 01:51:59,232
He is and

2329
01:51:59,488 --> 01:52:00,256
He comes in

2330
01:52:01,536 --> 01:52:02,560
Cific reason that I

2331
01:52:03,072 --> 01:52:03,584
Asterisk

2332
01:52:07,936 --> 01:52:09,216
If people want

2333
01:52:34,560 --> 01:52:35,840
The realization

2334
01:52:36,096 --> 01:52:42,240
From this Alex that you are alluding to is that no one is coming to save us

2335
01:52:42,496 --> 01:52:48,640
Out there that's going to save us from this political situation

2336
01:52:48,896 --> 01:52:53,248
Pedicure

2337
01:52:53,504 --> 01:52:54,272
Like

2338
01:52:54,528 --> 01:52:55,552
Literally

2339
01:52:57,600 --> 01:52:58,368
Weird

2340
01:52:59,904 --> 01:53:04,512
There is no data there's no God coming

2341
01:53:05,536 --> 01:53:06,560
Hold on

2342
01:53:06,816 --> 01:53:12,192
Talk about God all the damn time on the show as a like God will save us but alright

2343
01:53:13,472 --> 01:53:15,776
Your own religious beliefs

2344
01:53:18,592 --> 01:53:20,384
The reason Mike Saint is that

2345
01:53:21,408 --> 01:53:22,688
Mike Adams put out

2346
01:53:26,016 --> 01:53:27,040
Treatise

2347
01:53:27,296 --> 01:53:29,088
On

2348
01:53:30,880 --> 01:53:31,392
No

2349
01:53:31,904 --> 01:53:33,696
City nail it to the wall of the

2350
01:53:33,952 --> 01:53:34,464
The Catholic Church

2351
01:53:34,720 --> 01:53:38,304
Might as well if you posted it on naturalnews.com

2352
01:53:39,328 --> 01:53:43,424
Same thing same thing basically Mike Martin Luther Adams

2353
01:53:43,936 --> 01:53:47,520
661 have dozen of the other same Better Business

2354
01:53:49,312 --> 01:53:50,336
And it's V

2355
01:53:50,592 --> 01:53:52,640
Mainstream media's

2356
01:53:53,664 --> 01:53:54,688
Their battle plan

2357
01:53:54,944 --> 01:53:55,456
Dakota

2358
01:53:55,712 --> 01:53:56,736
That's the sort of

2359
01:53:58,528 --> 01:53:59,040
The login

2360
01:54:01,088 --> 01:54:04,672
I need to tell you I don't

2361
01:54:05,440 --> 01:54:09,024
Not into it this is called

2362
01:54:09,280 --> 01:54:11,072
Censorship master plan

2363
01:54:11,328 --> 01:54:11,840
Decoded

2364
01:54:13,632 --> 01:54:14,656
The Adams report

2365
01:54:15,680 --> 01:54:18,496
The blueprint

2366
01:54:18,752 --> 01:54:21,056
America can fight back again

2367
01:54:21,312 --> 01:54:21,824
Corporate

2368
01:54:22,080 --> 01:54:22,592

More credits

2378
01:54:52,032 --> 01:54:53,568
So I made the mistake of reading

2379
01:54:55,360 --> 01:54:59,456
Approximately 15 pages of notes that I took

2380
01:54:59,712 --> 01:55:05,856
Over the course of going to go into now

2381
01:55:06,112 --> 01:55:07,136
By Sunday

2382
01:55:07,392 --> 01:55:10,208
Posted on the website

2383
01:55:10,464 --> 01:55:11,232
He's trying to do here

2384
01:55:14,560 --> 01:55:16,096
Pitch this idea

2385
01:55:17,120 --> 01:55:18,144
Pieces of it is essentially

2386
01:55:18,400 --> 01:55:23,008
There's a mainstream media. He calls the liberal Tech Giants

2387
01:55:24,544 --> 01:55:25,056
Checking site

2388
01:55:25,568 --> 01:55:26,080
PolitiFact

2389
01:55:26,336 --> 01:55:26,848
Snopes

2390
01:55:27,104 --> 01:55:29,408
They're all together to shut down conservit

2391
01:55:30,688 --> 01:55:31,456
This time

2392
01:55:31,712 --> 01:55:36,320
Seems like it would track except for the lack of evidence that the mainstream Media or text Giants are actually

2393
01:55:36,576 --> 01:55:38,880
Apps that are liberal

2394
01:55:39,648 --> 01:55:41,696
No I don't know any

2395
01:55:43,488 --> 01:55:45,024
I'm also the other problems

2396
01:55:45,280 --> 01:55:46,048
Fact-checking sites

2397
01:55:47,328 --> 01:55:50,400
Not really on the side of the Liberals

2398
01:55:50,656 --> 01:55:52,192
But if you go to PolitiFact

2399
01:55:52,448 --> 01:55:53,216
If you go to Snopes

2400
01:55:53,728 --> 01:55:54,240
Very

2401
01:55:54,496 --> 01:55:55,264
Many instances

2402
01:55:56,032 --> 01:55:56,800
Like break

2403
01:55:57,056 --> 01:56:03,200
King down liberal-leaning lies

2404
01:56:03,456 --> 01:56:03,968
Real

2405
01:56:04,224 --> 01:56:05,504
Say real things

2406
01:56:05,760 --> 01:56:07,552
They're they're very much

2407
01:56:10,112 --> 01:56:10,880
Debunk both sides

2408
01:56:14,720 --> 01:56:16,768
If you want to talk about real

2409
01:56:17,280 --> 01:56:18,304
Let's talk about

2410
01:56:18,560 --> 01:56:20,352
If you want if your policy is like

2411
01:56:20,608 --> 01:56:22,144
I think tax cuts will

2412
01:56:22,400 --> 01:56:23,168
Benefit the economy

2413
01:56:23,424 --> 01:56:24,704
And mine is I don't think

2414
01:56:24,960 --> 01:56:25,728
Text got there going to bed

2415
01:56:26,752 --> 01:56:27,776
That's a conversation week

2416
01:56:28,288 --> 01:56:29,824
If your policy is like

2417
01:56:30,080 --> 01:56:33,920
I think we should make sure that parents and children are never allowed near each other

2418
01:56:37,248 --> 01:56:38,016
You can have a conversation

2419
01:56:38,528 --> 01:56:39,808
Political PolitiFact

2420
01:56:40,064 --> 01:56:41,088
Is all about just like

2421
01:56:41,856 --> 01:56:43,392
Things that are real

2422
01:56:44,160 --> 01:56:46,208
Otherwise

2423
01:56:46,464 --> 01:56:47,744
Yeah

2424
01:56:48,000 --> 01:56:54,144
Cuz I don't want to spend like an hour talking about all of the Bulge

2425
01:56:54,400 --> 01:56:54,912
It's just

2426
01:56:55,424 --> 01:56:56,192
Constant

2427
01:56:56,448 --> 01:56:57,472
Undefended

2428
01:56:57,984 --> 01:57:00,032
Statement

2429
01:57:00,288 --> 01:57:00,800
That don't

2430
01:57:01,056 --> 01:57:02,848
Channel 2

2431
01:57:03,104 --> 01:57:03,616
Yeah

2432
01:57:03,872 --> 01:57:05,664
Of the tech Giants are liberal

2433
01:57:05,920 --> 01:57:10,016
Yeah there's that ain't right no proof of it there's no evidence given

2434
01:57:10,272 --> 01:57:10,784
Don't need it

2435
01:57:11,296 --> 01:57:12,320
Conspiratorial

2436
01:57:12,576 --> 01:57:14,624
Like an eighth grade paper

2437
01:57:14,880 --> 01:57:16,928
Right really really poorly written

2438
01:57:20,256 --> 01:57:20,768
I was

2439
01:57:21,024 --> 01:57:22,048
Fact-checking

2440
01:57:22,304 --> 01:57:24,864
At the top of my notes it's really sincere like

2441
01:57:25,120 --> 01:57:29,728
12

2442
01:57:29,984 --> 01:57:35,616
I start to refer to him in the second person

2443
01:57:35,872 --> 01:57:40,992
What are you

2444
01:57:41,248 --> 01:57:44,320
So there's one thing though there's a train that goes through this that I think is really

2445
01:57:45,344 --> 01:57:47,392
Paragraph

2446
01:57:48,672 --> 01:57:49,184
I think is

2447
01:57:50,720 --> 01:57:55,072
There was a Time in America when one specific group of people was told to sit at the back of the bus

2448
01:57:55,584 --> 01:57:57,632
Certain cafes were reserved for whites only

2449
01:57:58,144 --> 01:57:58,912
Have you

2450
01:57:59,168 --> 01:58:00,704
Punished based on the color of their skin

2451
01:58:03,008 --> 01:58:05,312
Now judge people based on the color of their thoughts

2452
01:58:06,080 --> 01:58:10,432
And conservative Trump supporters and Advocates of Natural Health content or over

2453
01:58:10,688 --> 01:58:11,968
We don't serve your kind here

2454
01:58:12,480 --> 01:58:14,784
90s throwback

2455
01:58:15,040 --> 01:58:20,928
That's a little like

2456
01:58:23,232 --> 01:58:28,608
And they don't like that okay alright

2457
01:58:29,632 --> 01:58:30,400
Roundly rejected

2458
01:58:30,912 --> 01:58:33,216
So the part that I really want to draw syrup Focus 2 is

2459
01:58:33,472 --> 01:58:34,240
Cuz I was like

2460
01:58:35,264 --> 01:58:36,032
The color of their thought

2461
01:58:36,544 --> 01:58:39,104
I think that you're proud of that is a turn of phrase

2462
01:58:41,152 --> 01:58:42,688
Glycol

2463
01:58:43,968 --> 01:58:45,248
You get one

2464
01:58:45,504 --> 01:58:46,528
Also

2465
01:58:46,784 --> 01:58:48,576
Complains so much around

2466
01:58:48,832 --> 01:58:49,344
The times when

2467
01:58:52,160 --> 01:58:54,976
White male Christian opinions not being welcome

2468
01:58:55,232 --> 01:58:58,048
Color of their socks

2469
01:58:58,304 --> 01:59:00,096
Metaphor what

2470
01:59:00,352 --> 01:59:00,864
Like you said

2471
01:59:01,376 --> 01:59:04,192
I think it's Conkey for someone like you to use I'm suspicious

2472
01:59:04,448 --> 01:59:06,752
When you keep using it

2473
01:59:07,264 --> 01:59:12,896
Clear that you're worried that white men aren't being listened to right

2474
01:59:14,176 --> 01:59:19,808
Thought if you if you put it like like that is a 75% of the way through that's your

2475
01:59:20,064 --> 01:59:21,344
Turn of phrase

2476
01:59:21,600 --> 01:59:23,136
Boom that's going to take me home

2477
01:59:23,392 --> 01:59:23,904
Occlusion

2478
01:59:24,160 --> 01:59:26,208
I f****** nailed that what I mean

2479
01:59:26,464 --> 01:59:26,976
Is

2480
01:59:27,232 --> 01:59:27,744
Redzed

2481
01:59:28,000 --> 01:59:30,304
What I mean is like the color results

2482
01:59:30,560 --> 01:59:32,608
Red

2483
01:59:32,864 --> 01:59:33,376
And then

2484
01:59:33,632 --> 01:59:35,680
If you use it multiple times what it means

2485
01:59:35,936 --> 01:59:37,472
What it means is

2486
01:59:39,264 --> 01:59:40,544
He first used it

2487
01:59:43,360 --> 01:59:46,432
You get one use of that that's your f******

2488
01:59:46,688 --> 01:59:47,200
Closer

2489
01:59:47,456 --> 01:59:48,736
Does metamagic

2490
01:59:50,016 --> 01:59:51,808
The other things that I just think would be fun

2491
01:59:52,320 --> 01:59:52,832
Point out

2492
01:59:53,088 --> 01:59:54,112
AR

2493
01:59:54,368 --> 01:59:55,136
Just have constant

2494
01:59:55,392 --> 01:59:56,416
Complaints about like

2495
01:59:56,672 --> 01:59:57,696
You're not allowed

2496
01:59:57,952 --> 01:59:58,464
To express

2497
01:59:58,976 --> 01:59:59,488
Why

2498
01:59:59,744 --> 02:00:01,536
Christian Caucasian culture

2499
02:00:03,328 --> 02:00:04,096
I think that this argument

2500
02:00:04,352 --> 02:00:05,376
It gets brought up a lot

2501
02:00:05,632 --> 02:00:06,144
And I'd like to

2502
02:00:06,400 --> 02:00:06,912
Respond to that

2503
02:00:07,424 --> 02:00:07,936
You are

2504
02:00:08,704 --> 02:00:09,728
You're just not allowed

2505
02:00:09,984 --> 02:00:10,496
To do the race

2506
02:00:11,008 --> 02:00:13,312
Stop the part of it

2507
02:00:14,080 --> 02:00:15,872
If you want to have a barbecue on the 4th

2508
02:00:17,920 --> 02:00:18,432
Enjoy

2509
02:00:18,944 --> 02:00:19,456
That's good

2510
02:00:20,992 --> 02:00:27,136
Text super-fun or if you are come for broiling

2511
02:00:27,392 --> 02:00:29,696
Do you want to celebrate

2512
02:00:29,952 --> 02:00:30,976
Nobody going to complain

2513
02:00:31,232 --> 02:00:34,304
The problem is

2514
02:00:34,560 --> 02:00:35,328
Problem come

2515
02:00:35,840 --> 02:00:36,864
When the part of your

2516
02:00:37,120 --> 02:00:37,888
Your culture you're mad

2517
02:00:38,400 --> 02:00:39,168
Celebrate

2518
02:00:39,424 --> 02:00:41,216
Is the South will rise again

2519
02:00:41,472 --> 02:00:44,800
You know you're trying to rewrite what happened during

2520
02:00:45,056 --> 02:00:47,360
The Civil War all right

2521
02:00:47,616 --> 02:00:48,128
Is Dwight

2522
02:00:49,152 --> 02:00:50,176
You want to celebrate

2523
02:00:50,432 --> 02:00:50,944
The heritage

2524
02:00:51,200 --> 02:00:51,712
Understand

2525
02:00:53,504 --> 02:00:54,272
Thoreau problem

2526
02:00:54,784 --> 02:00:55,808
Gavin McGinnis one

2527
02:00:56,064 --> 02:00:56,832
To celebrate

2528
02:00:57,088 --> 02:00:57,600
Patriarchy

2529
02:00:58,112 --> 02:00:59,392
Which you would just described as like

2530
02:00:59,648 --> 02:01:01,184
Hey this is my male identity

2531
02:01:01,440 --> 02:01:02,976
The problem with that is

2532
02:01:03,232 --> 02:01:04,000
For decades

2533
02:01:06,048 --> 02:01:08,352
The patriarchy what it represent

2534
02:01:08,608 --> 02:01:09,120
Women being

2535
02:01:09,376 --> 02:01:09,888
Sing

2536
02:01:10,144 --> 02:01:11,424
Women being

2537
02:01:11,936 --> 02:01:13,216
Anyone thinking

2538
02:01:16,032 --> 02:01:16,544
It's not

2539
02:01:17,568 --> 02:01:18,592
If it's not larger than yours

2540
02:01:19,616 --> 02:01:25,760
Is it okay to mail fraternity of chauvinist and they scream

2541
02:01:26,016 --> 02:01:27,040
Call the patriarchies back

2542
02:01:27,296 --> 02:01:28,064
That sort of thing

2543
02:01:28,832 --> 02:01:30,112
It's really clear that people will

2544
02:01:30,368 --> 02:01:31,136
Hear that and be like

2545
02:01:31,392 --> 02:01:34,720
Really excited about is the idea of being able to hit

2546
02:01:34,976 --> 02:01:35,488
Me privately

2547
02:01:37,024 --> 02:01:40,608
As opposed to if you're just someone who's like I like being the guy

2548
02:01:40,864 --> 02:01:45,472
No one's mad about that no no there's a lot of people who are actually superscore that

2549
02:01:47,008 --> 02:01:48,032
LastPass

2550
02:01:50,592 --> 02:01:51,104
Just illustrates

2551
02:01:53,664 --> 02:01:54,432
Is Rampage 20

2552
02:01:54,688 --> 02:01:56,480
Monopolist

2553
02:01:56,736 --> 02:01:57,760
Claim that their gods

2554
02:01:58,016 --> 02:02:00,576
You possess the Divine reality

2555
02:02:01,088 --> 02:02:03,392
The claims maxo Journal cultizm

2556
02:02:05,184 --> 02:02:07,232
I think he's coining phrase there

2557
02:02:08,768 --> 02:02:14,912
Is no different from the delusions of the high priest of the Ancient Maya and Aztec cultures who also for

2558
02:02:15,168 --> 02:02:20,800
Proclaim that only a select class of divinely ordained individuals could speak to God and interpret reality for the masses

2559
02:02:21,056 --> 02:02:27,200
The holy of holies you were looked into Christian history

2560
02:02:29,504 --> 02:02:35,648
Sojourn occult

2561
02:02:35,904 --> 02:02:37,184
Thrown into an ism

2562
02:02:37,440 --> 02:02:40,768
G-Eazy

2563
02:02:41,024 --> 02:02:42,816
The Aztec and Mayan cultures or

2564
02:02:44,096 --> 02:02:47,424
That's the beginning of Christianity

2565
02:02:47,936 --> 02:02:51,520
Because you're a Biro communistic capitalist

2566
02:02:51,776 --> 02:02:52,544
That's what you are

2567
02:02:52,800 --> 02:02:56,128
You're a cam you alcohol acerbis

2568
02:02:56,896 --> 02:03:02,272
That does the blizzard and then I believe in public property of alcohol

2569
02:03:02,528 --> 02:03:03,552
Clear Lake

2570
02:03:04,320 --> 02:03:05,600
Sure

2571
02:03:09,696 --> 02:03:14,816
Hot nonsense when they are pointing the finger at the Aztecs when was the exact same thing the Christians did

2572
02:03:15,328 --> 02:03:17,632
It's so crazy

2573
02:03:18,912 --> 02:03:19,680
There's that whole section

2574
02:03:20,960 --> 02:03:23,264
That people weren't allowed to go anywhere

2575
02:03:23,520 --> 02:03:27,104
I would go in your messages

2576
02:03:27,360 --> 02:03:28,384
What one of the reason

2577
02:03:28,640 --> 02:03:29,152
The Jesus was

2578
02:03:29,408 --> 02:03:29,920
So Revolution

2579
02:03:30,176 --> 02:03:31,200
Marietta

2580
02:03:31,968 --> 02:03:32,480
Personal relationship

2581
02:03:32,736 --> 02:03:36,064
Through it broke down the Walls

2582
02:03:36,320 --> 02:03:37,856
Between the holy of holy in the masses

2583
02:03:38,112 --> 02:03:40,416
There was an ability to have

2584
02:03:40,928 --> 02:03:42,720
You could play a role in religion

2585
02:03:42,976 --> 02:03:44,768
Opposed to it being told to you by

2586
02:03:45,280 --> 02:03:50,656
Fractal

2587
02:03:50,912 --> 02:03:55,264
To this is some sort of different thing with the ice

2588
02:03:56,544 --> 02:04:00,384
I don't think you want to talk about like Christian culture and like

2589
02:04:00,896 --> 02:04:01,920
You really love

2590
02:04:02,176 --> 02:04:04,480
White male Christian identity

2591
02:04:04,736 --> 02:04:06,016
You don't even know what Christ

2592
02:04:06,272 --> 02:04:06,784
Stood for

2593
02:04:07,040 --> 02:04:11,904
I'm not saying you weren't a Christian or anything like that

2594
02:04:12,160 --> 02:04:12,672
Deposit

2595
02:04:13,184 --> 02:04:15,488
Bet you don't have an in-depth understanding

2596
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:17,280
Or maybe

2597
02:04:18,816 --> 02:04:20,096
There's no truth

2598
02:04:20,352 --> 02:04:21,376
Greater than that

2599
02:04:21,632 --> 02:04:24,192
Evangelical Christianity as it is right now

2600
02:04:24,704 --> 02:04:27,264
Love every part of the Bible except for the parts where G

2601
02:04:27,776 --> 02:04:28,288
This is allowed

2602
02:04:29,056 --> 02:04:29,568
What is it like

2603
02:04:30,080 --> 02:04:32,384
Yeah just like you know all the stuff

2604
02:04:32,640 --> 02:04:33,664
You guys think it's cool

2605
02:04:34,432 --> 02:04:34,944
Stop it

2606
02:04:35,968 --> 02:04:38,016
They don't like the part where he's a new way

2607
02:04:38,272 --> 02:04:41,088
They want the Old Testament but with like

2608
02:04:43,136 --> 02:04:43,904
You know they want

2609
02:04:44,160 --> 02:04:47,744
Meat of the Old Testament right

2610
02:04:49,792 --> 02:04:51,840
They want the cash area of be like

2611
02:04:52,096 --> 02:04:56,448
Exactly

2612
02:04:56,704 --> 02:04:58,240
Being manifest

2613
02:04:59,264 --> 02:05:01,824
La Glory's all of us right

2614
02:05:02,336 --> 02:05:02,848
Arson

2615
02:05:03,104 --> 02:05:03,872
Being washed away

2616
02:05:04,128 --> 02:05:05,152
They want that stuff

2617
02:05:05,408 --> 02:05:06,432
But they want the f***

2618
02:05:06,944 --> 02:05:08,480
Really hardcore

2619
02:05:08,736 --> 02:05:14,880
Rules and they want that

2620
02:05:15,136 --> 02:05:18,208
It's like when Bush K today

2621
02:05:18,464 --> 02:05:19,232
And it was like

2622
02:05:19,488 --> 02:05:20,000
Oh this is

2623
02:05:20,256 --> 02:05:23,072
Compassionate conservative

2624
02:05:28,448 --> 02:05:29,728
Just like it does

2625
02:05:29,984 --> 02:05:32,544
Parts of the Bible where God murder people

2626
02:05:32,800 --> 02:05:33,312
Like you know

2627
02:05:33,568 --> 02:05:35,872
That's the stuff that we really want but also Jesus

2628
02:05:36,128 --> 02:05:36,640
Is there

2629
02:05:37,152 --> 02:05:38,688
Andy might have killed

2630
02:05:41,760 --> 02:05:42,528
That's true

2631
02:05:43,040 --> 02:05:44,320
Kerry Cassidy told me about that

2632
02:05:44,576 --> 02:05:47,136
So we have one more quick left

2633
02:05:47,392 --> 02:05:47,904
And this is

2634
02:05:48,160 --> 02:05:48,672
Familiar

2635
02:05:48,928 --> 02:05:49,696
I'm actually starting

2636
02:05:51,744 --> 02:05:52,256
Disappointed with my

2637
02:05:54,048 --> 02:05:54,816
Understand this

2638
02:05:55,072 --> 02:05:56,096
Game much earlier

2639
02:05:56,608 --> 02:05:57,120
Kind of didn't

2640
02:05:57,376 --> 02:05:58,400
Intuitively but I never was

2641
02:05:59,424 --> 02:06:01,984
Two words but it's back in

2642
02:06:02,240 --> 02:06:03,008
2009

2643
02:06:03,776 --> 02:06:04,800
And we see it hear it

2644
02:06:05,568 --> 02:06:06,336
In all the time

2645
02:06:06,848 --> 02:06:07,616
And again

2646
02:06:07,872 --> 02:06:08,384
A little

2647
02:06:08,896 --> 02:06:09,408
I should have been able

2648
02:06:09,664 --> 02:06:10,944
Crystallized

2649
02:06:17,856 --> 02:06:20,160
Will share with you my worst-case sub

2650
02:06:20,672 --> 02:06:26,816
Clear false flag

2651
02:06:29,120 --> 02:06:29,632
Exactly

2652
02:06:29,888 --> 02:06:30,912
Trump

2653
02:06:31,168 --> 02:06:32,192
They blame it on

2654
02:06:32,448 --> 02:06:37,312
Patriots are they blamed on Trump's negotiations with North Korea they could say it's North Korea

2655
02:06:37,568 --> 02:06:40,128
Fighting back

2656
02:06:40,384 --> 02:06:41,408
But they take out Trump

2657
02:06:41,664 --> 02:06:46,528
And they take out 200,000 Americans at the same time

2658
02:06:46,784 --> 02:06:51,136
The Blacklist all conservatives all speech online and any dissenting views

2659
02:06:51,648 --> 02:06:54,208
This is the plant they have to silence you Alex

2660
02:06:54,464 --> 02:07:00,608
Before taking the rest got us down

2661
02:07:03,680 --> 02:07:08,032
Well before the election

2662
02:07:08,288 --> 02:07:12,384
Biological or nuclear event

2663
02:07:12,896 --> 02:07:13,664
See that's the thing

2664
02:07:13,920 --> 02:07:14,944
All they have to do

2665
02:07:15,200 --> 02:07:21,344
Is an enema

2666
02:07:22,112 --> 02:07:24,928
Show me my roster for Oklahoma to office

2667
02:07:25,184 --> 02:07:31,328
No nobody ever nobody ever know nobody nobody ever threatened

2668
02:07:31,584 --> 02:07:32,352
Humid

2669
02:07:32,608 --> 02:07:37,472
Nobody ever did propaganda

2670
02:07:37,728 --> 02:07:38,240
Complain about it

2671
02:07:38,752 --> 02:07:39,520
Nevermind

2672
02:07:40,032 --> 02:07:40,544
Never happen

2673
02:07:40,800 --> 02:07:43,872
Look the thing that I was referring to before the clip

2674
02:07:44,128 --> 02:07:44,640
This is official

2675
02:07:46,432 --> 02:07:47,968
This is just pre-emptive narrative

2676
02:07:49,504 --> 02:07:50,016
When Alex and

2677
02:07:50,272 --> 02:07:52,576
2009 is saying that

2678
02:07:52,832 --> 02:07:58,976
Attack of terrorism

2679
02:08:01,280 --> 02:08:05,120
Not Feliz spelling all that out yet much more amateurish about it now

2680
02:08:05,632 --> 02:08:07,680
Do you spelling it out a little bit too much

2681
02:08:07,936 --> 02:08:08,960
More specific predictions

2682
02:08:09,216 --> 02:08:15,360
I think it's going to be a biological or nuclear attack before the midterm

2683
02:08:17,408 --> 02:08:21,760
Much more clunky about this now but other reflect on it I realize that he was doing this

2684
02:08:22,016 --> 02:08:23,552
Is all the time that we've been covering

2685
02:08:24,064 --> 02:08:26,880
You talking about how they're going to attack the inauguration

2686
02:08:27,136 --> 02:08:29,440
They're going to fly a helicopter

2687
02:08:29,696 --> 02:08:30,464
He does this all the

2688
02:08:30,720 --> 02:08:31,232
Time with

2689
02:08:31,488 --> 02:08:33,280
These pre-emptive narrative

2690
02:08:33,536 --> 02:08:34,304
The track

2691
02:08:34,560 --> 02:08:37,376
He's laying

2692
02:08:37,888 --> 02:08:38,912
I'm going to head to my bed

2693
02:08:39,424 --> 02:08:40,960
So I will be able

2694
02:08:43,008 --> 02:08:43,520
Brilliant

2695
02:08:43,776 --> 02:08:44,544
Because what you do

2696
02:08:44,800 --> 02:08:45,824
Is you create this

2697
02:08:46,080 --> 02:08:46,592
Real

2698
02:08:46,848 --> 02:08:48,896
Serious thing for your audience to be afraid of

2699
02:08:49,664 --> 02:08:50,432
It's not going to happen

2700
02:08:50,944 --> 02:08:51,456
But

2701
02:08:51,712 --> 02:08:54,272
On the off-chance goes crazy

2702
02:08:56,832 --> 02:09:00,928
Senor Nostradamus well we talked about it

2703
02:09:01,184 --> 02:09:03,488
To the globalist got scared and they didn't pull the

2704
02:09:06,560 --> 02:09:07,072
So

2705
02:09:07,584 --> 02:09:09,120
The end of this what I want to come too

2706
02:09:09,632 --> 02:09:10,144
Is

2707
02:09:11,424 --> 02:09:12,192
I didn't expect

2708
02:09:12,448 --> 02:09:14,752
Let me just a little longer than I predicted and I'm sorry about

2709
02:09:15,264 --> 02:09:16,288
I didn't predict

2710
02:09:16,544 --> 02:09:19,872
20 minutes of top talking about

2711
02:09:20,128 --> 02:09:20,640
The fake bangs

2712
02:09:20,896 --> 02:09:22,944
Yeah

2713
02:09:23,200 --> 02:09:23,968
But

2714
02:09:25,248 --> 02:09:27,296
Everyone's really focused on these fake bands

2715
02:09:27,808 --> 02:09:28,832
And I understand

2716
02:09:29,088 --> 02:09:29,856
Everyone wants

2717
02:09:30,112 --> 02:09:30,880
To do a little dance

2718
02:09:31,392 --> 02:09:31,904
And be like

2719
02:09:35,232 --> 02:09:36,512
They want to do that

2720
02:09:36,768 --> 02:09:38,304
Because it's fun and it's gratifying

2721
02:09:38,560 --> 02:09:39,584
For people who aren't doing anything

2722
02:09:41,376 --> 02:09:41,888
I understand

2723
02:09:42,400 --> 02:09:44,192
I don't expect that our coverage out of the media

2724
02:09:44,448 --> 02:09:48,800
I resent a little bit is that the way they are covering it

2725
02:09:49,568 --> 02:09:50,336
Is an advantage

2726
02:09:51,360 --> 02:09:52,128
He plays into his house

2727
02:09:53,152 --> 02:09:53,664
And

2728
02:09:54,432 --> 02:09:55,456
In present day

2729
02:09:55,968 --> 02:09:57,760
Everyone's talking about that

2730
02:09:58,272 --> 02:10:00,064
People aren't talking about the fact

2731
02:10:00,320 --> 02:10:02,368
Said he had a New Zealand preacher

2732
02:10:02,624 --> 02:10:06,208
Who prayed that a homosexual would commit suicide

2733
02:10:08,000 --> 02:10:08,768
Being deported

2734
02:10:09,280 --> 02:10:12,096
Very legitimate reasons for harassing muzzle

2735
02:10:12,608 --> 02:10:13,632
And at the same time

2736
02:10:14,656 --> 02:10:16,448
Very clearly Express position

2737
02:10:16,704 --> 02:10:18,752
You should be scared of everyone who's not

2738
02:10:19,264 --> 02:10:20,288
All of this white

2739
02:10:20,800 --> 02:10:21,312
Fear

2740
02:10:21,824 --> 02:10:22,592
His very consist

2741
02:10:23,616 --> 02:10:24,640
People are talking about that

2742
02:10:24,896 --> 02:10:25,408
Nearly f***

2743
02:10:26,432 --> 02:10:27,456
I meant at the same time

2744
02:10:29,504 --> 02:10:30,272
This is just like

2745
02:10:31,808 --> 02:10:32,320
Nobody does

2746
02:10:32,576 --> 02:10:33,856
Yep

2747
02:10:34,112 --> 02:10:35,648
Yeah you don't then stop

2748
02:10:36,160 --> 02:10:36,672
Stop helping them

2749
02:10:36,928 --> 02:10:37,696
Yeah I don't know

2750
02:10:37,952 --> 02:10:39,744
Hard for me to put a button on this but like

2751
02:10:40,256 --> 02:10:42,816
I'm a little mad

2752
02:10:43,328 --> 02:10:45,632
If you're if you're going to pretend to

2753
02:10:46,912 --> 02:10:48,448
Well then f****** suck it up and

2754
02:10:48,960 --> 02:10:50,752
If you're not going to

2755
02:10:51,776 --> 02:10:52,288
Bother

2756
02:10:56,128 --> 02:10:56,896
Exactly what he

2757
02:10:57,152 --> 02:10:57,920
Hope you do

2758
02:10:58,432 --> 02:10:59,456
Because all you're doing

2759
02:10:59,712 --> 02:11:02,016
He's giving him 2 weeks of full-on

2760
02:11:02,272 --> 02:11:08,160
Guess what these m************ are trying to take us down you need to give us more money and then whenever you let him back on

2761
02:11:08,416 --> 02:11:12,256
He's going to do the same f****** s***

2762
02:11:13,536 --> 02:11:19,680
And then whenever

2763
02:11:20,960 --> 02:11:21,728
We are forever

2764
02:11:21,984 --> 02:11:26,336
More than ever because they're going to try

2765
02:11:26,592 --> 02:11:27,872
Leg is all part of the same

2766
02:11:28,128 --> 02:11:29,920
I would like

2767
02:11:30,176 --> 02:11:31,712

02:11:33,248 --> 02:11:35,040
Bluffing Epona

02:11:35,296 --> 02:11:39,136
Yeah to raise them a little bit

2770
02:11:39,392 --> 02:11:40,672
You're doing a s*** raise

2771
02:11:41,184 --> 02:11:44,000
And then they're just going to push back with a

2772
02:11:44,256 --> 02:11:45,792
Yeah they're going to go all in on you

2773
02:11:47,584 --> 02:11:51,680
Then you're in the position of folding or calling their aggression

2774
02:11:51,936 --> 02:11:52,448
Either

2775
02:11:52,704 --> 02:11:53,472
Play

2776
02:11:53,728 --> 02:11:54,496
And push

2777
02:11:57,056 --> 02:12:00,384
Otherwise you're going to lose lose that f****** hand

2778
02:12:00,640 --> 02:12:01,152
Alex Jones
