1
00:00:21,248 --> 00:00:27,392
I have great respect for knowledge but I'm sick of them posing as you're through the good guy

2
00:00:34,048 --> 00:00:40,192
MoneyGram

3
00:00:53,248 --> 00:00:59,136
Collegeboard.com

4
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:05,536
Everybody would like to know that's right I'm down like sit around talk a little bit about Alex Jones

5
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:08,352
Indeed we are.

6
00:01:08,608 --> 00:01:11,680
Have you ever been forgotten in a mall or the

7
00:01:12,192 --> 00:01:13,984
Yeah

8
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:14,752
Terrifying

9
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:18,592
When I was a kid I had like a real serious

10
00:01:19,616 --> 00:01:20,896
Fear of being left places

11
00:01:21,152 --> 00:01:23,200
Oh yeah and I believe it was based on

12
00:01:23,456 --> 00:01:23,968
I like being

13
00:01:24,224 --> 00:01:24,736
Lost

14
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:26,272
Supermarket

15
00:01:26,528 --> 00:01:28,320
When I was really young boy

16
00:01:28,576 --> 00:01:33,952
They drive away or was it just like the other day they were still in the

17
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:39,840
My parents are still okay but I would like it very visceral memories

18
00:01:40,096 --> 00:01:44,192
I don't know where I don't know how to get where I need to be right all right

19
00:01:44,448 --> 00:01:49,824
And like I've always lived or like when I was younger in Honolulu and then also in Columbiaville

20
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,360
Missouri I lived

21
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:53,408
Close enough that I was supposed to walk to

22
00:01:53,664 --> 00:01:54,176
School

23
00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:56,224
Answer like when we lived in Hawaii

24
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:56,992
My mom was at

25
00:01:57,504 --> 00:01:58,528
You're at the school that I want

26
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:02,112
So you know what we'd walk to school together and then I'd stay after

27
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:04,160
After school while she wrapped up stuff and then we

28
00:02:04,672 --> 00:02:08,768
You know walk back but then we moved to Missouri I was

29
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:10,560
In 4th grade

30
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:11,840
And it's a walk

31
00:02:12,096 --> 00:02:12,864
To school

32
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,144
And I just had like

33
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,168
A really bad Sin

34
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:17,216
So there would be

35
00:02:17,472 --> 00:02:20,800
Times when I would just like to try and take a slightly different route and just get

36
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:24,128
Weekly loss no and I have this

37
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:25,408
Real fear of being

38
00:02:26,176 --> 00:02:27,200
Yeah very

39
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:30,016
Very strong fear that everyone was

40
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:33,856
To get me grown out of that

41
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:36,928
Walking home from school

42
00:02:37,184 --> 00:02:40,256
A car that passes any car is like there are they're going to

43
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:44,864
It's over for my location

44
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:45,632
Awful

45
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:48,192
State to be in

46
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:49,472
Constantly walking

47
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:50,752
To and from school

48
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:57,152
Terrified of anybody and not sharing that fear because that would be that would be shameful as well

49
00:02:57,408 --> 00:02:59,968
Oh man I was like probably 11

50
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,760
Or so and I was walking home

51
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:03,040
From school and I just got

52
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:03,808
I completely lost

53
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:04,576
Like II

54
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:11,232
I am now in my adult brain I can map out that neighborhood and I know exactly where I would have needed to go

55
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:12,512
Right

56
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:13,280
I don't know 10

57
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:14,048
10 blocks from

58
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:15,584
My house or so but

59
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,352
Because it was like

60
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:17,888
Is residential neighborhood

61
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:19,168
With winding streets

62
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:20,704
It's an offshoot cul-de-sac

63
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,472
What have you

64
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:24,288
I just completely lost I have no idea where to go

65
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:25,824
And I just started crying

66
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,152
And I like knocked on someone's door

67
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,712
I don't know how to get home

68
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:38,880
Looking for cell phones I don't have a cell phone at home anyway

69
00:03:39,136 --> 00:03:40,928
GPS existence

70
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:44,256
Yeah it's a difference in there was there was super nice and I

71
00:03:44,512 --> 00:03:50,656
Okay I'm 35 now it's still really appreciate it

72
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:55,520
Dental very just like oh my god let's let's get you where you get the wrong

73
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:56,800
And so on

74
00:03:57,056 --> 00:03:58,592
I got homebodii.

75
00:03:59,104 --> 00:04:01,152
Very very strong fear isn't as much as

76
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:02,176
Younger of being lost

77
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:07,040
I still I guess I'm a little bit now but with the Advent of cell phones in like maps and

78
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:07,808
Stop it

79
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:09,088
It's pretty tough

80
00:04:09,344 --> 00:04:10,624
To be fully lost

81
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,416
If your phone is charged it really is

82
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:16,512
It really is it requires a bunch of things to go wrong alley.

83
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:20,095
Sometimes you could still end up in a place where it's like well I know where I am

84
00:04:20,351 --> 00:04:26,495
There's not much I can do about that really far away from a train station or are they lose your job

85
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:31,103
It's tough but

86
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:33,407
Lessened with a

87
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:37,247
Yeah I'm so this is like his Rhino bit about the other feeling

88
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:38,015
The being left

89
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:42,879
Did not very much

90
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:49,791

Reference to something I think I said

114
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:20,927
Wayback on this podcast I have no idea what context

115
00:06:21,183 --> 00:06:22,207
But I

116
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:23,231
I like being remind

117
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:29,631
I recall it was probably something

118
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:37,567
I like what these guys do I'd like to support the show

119
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:39,871

It'll be lovely

123
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:47,295
So Jordan today like I said

124
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:50,879
Wacky Wednesday so it's been awhile since

125
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:57,279
We checked in on the world of the Jim Bakker Show and the main reason for that is his show is dumb as s***

126
00:06:57,535 --> 00:07:01,375
It's so profoundly boring to listen to and it's so incredibly rare

127
00:07:01,631 --> 00:07:02,655
For Jim or one of his guests

128
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:03,935
To say anything that I think

129
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:05,471
Even merits looking into

130
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:12,383
Like if he's going to have people like Steve Quayle or Tom Horn coming in talking about the giant Giants and angels

131
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:15,199
Baseball teams

132
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:16,479
Then Bang

133
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:20,063
There's not a whole lot I can do with

134
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:20,831
Stuff like that

135
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:26,463
But the reality is that the Jim Bakker Show is the media offshoot of a manipulative abusive money called

136
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:29,791
He feeds off his audience of tremendously cynical ways

137
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:31,327
And even if your show is boring

138
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:32,863
And half the s*** that said on the show

139
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:35,679
Can't possibly even be shown to be true or false

140
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:37,727
I think it's still important to check in for

141
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:38,495
From time to time

142
00:07:39,007 --> 00:07:41,311
Particularly when his world intersect with

143
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:42,079
Reality

144
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:46,687
At the end of last week it was announced the trumpet appointed mega-church scammer

145
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:51,807
Jim Bakker associate Paula white-cain as to an official position in the White House

146
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:55,647
He'd previously been a spiritual advisor to him

147
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:59,743
But it was announced that she was now officially working in the office of public liaison

148
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:05,887
If you'd like to learn more about Paula's Fuller story we didn't episode about her called heresy and God

149
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:08,959
What you can find in our archives or talk about

150
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:09,983
Churches in

151
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:10,751
And all that stuff

152
00:08:11,263 --> 00:08:14,591
For now suffice it to say that she is a Prosperity Gospel preacher

153
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:17,151
Who made millions of dollars by scamming her followers

154
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:18,687
She advocated

155
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:19,711
The principle of first

156
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:23,295
Fruits where you need to send her all the money that you make in January

157
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:24,575
To make sure that you make

158
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:26,367
Even more money the rest of the year

159
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:27,647
Which is cool

160
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:28,671
At that

161
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:30,719
Still one of my eggs

162
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:31,999
One of my most

163
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:33,535
Incredible

164
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:37,887
I got to give it up to you it's really hard to just say that

165
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:44,287
You know that's Jedi level just like hey if I say this enough I'm going to make

166
00:08:44,543 --> 00:08:45,311
Millions of dollars that's crazy

167
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:47,103
It's a startling level of sin

168
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:49,151
Yeah yeah you're demonstrating

169
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:52,479
And it's one thing to say that you'll gain

170
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:53,503
Future blessing

171
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:56,319
If you give her 112 the money you making a year

172
00:08:56,831 --> 00:08:58,623
It's shity and awful but at least it's

173
00:08:58,879 --> 00:08:59,647
Just an offer

174
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:04,511
But in reality the way Paula preaches at the first fruits thing is a threat

175
00:09:05,023 --> 00:09:05,791
She said quote

176
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:08,607
When you honor this principle that provides the foundation

177
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:11,167
Structure for God's blessings and Promises in your life

178
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:11,935
It unlocked

179
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:12,959
Deep dimensions

180
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:15,775
Spiritual truths that literally transform your life

181
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:19,871
When you apply this everything comes and Divine Alignment for his plan and promise

182
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:20,639
For you

183
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:24,479
When you don't honor it whether through ignorance or direct disobedience

184
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:26,015
There are consequence

185
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:28,575
There are consequences

186
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:30,367
The fuk Paula white-cain

187
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:35,487
Yes he's one of the most transparent scam artist in the field of

188
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:39,583
And the fact that Trump would give her a job in the government is so unsurprising

189
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:44,703
But so profoundly offensive considering he's one of the most transparent scammers

190
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:49,567
So in the middle of October last month yeah

191
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:51,359
Paula White Cain was a guest

192
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:52,127

00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:55,711

And what have you and

197
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:06,463

Very very small point

206
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:46,399
Very small point

207
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:51,775
Why does Jim Bakker say thank you Tammy Sue Bakker

208
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:58,175
Do you not know why do you use your daughter's last day

209
00:10:58,431 --> 00:11:00,735
Bizarre

210
00:11:02,015 --> 00:11:03,807
Miss Tammy

211
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:07,391
Thank you Miss Baker

212
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:09,439
Daughter

00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:11,999
I'm sure they have a great relationship

214
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:13,791
It just seems very strange

215
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:17,119
Thank you Tammy Sue Bakker

216
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:18,655
It's almost like you

217
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:20,703
Incapable of not doing an ad

218
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:26,591
You know like this is I am making sure that you get full full credits in the in the

219
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:32,991
Yeah I don't know exactly but I don't want them to think of some other Tammy I don't know why but that really was a hang

220
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:34,271
I was listening

221
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:36,575
I had to listen to that a couple times you like

222
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:38,623
Am I weird or is that weird

223
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:41,951
I've decided

224
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:45,023
Wright didn't even have to say that you fart right

225
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:51,423
I would feel like my dad did a like religious studies being radio show

226
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:53,215
Like in Columbia Missouri

227
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:55,007
And I was a guest on it

228
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:58,335
And if if you was introducing me and he's like I guess

229
00:11:58,847 --> 00:11:59,615
Is my son

230
00:11:59,871 --> 00:12:03,199
Damn freezer I would feel weird

231
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:08,063
My son Daniel

232
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:09,343
More

233
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:11,135
It's not like he's

234
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:12,159
Intro Youtube

235
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:14,207
Do 45 know

236
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:14,975
No

237
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:16,767
My son

238
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:23,167
Great, that works for me I'd be fine with that even if he was I would still feel weird

239
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:24,191
Formal

240
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:28,031
Anyway

241
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:32,639
So Paula White Cain is on the show primarily to promote her new book

242
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:35,199
There's a new book out called something more

243
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:38,783
That is probably the best

244
00:12:39,295 --> 00:12:40,319
Yeah

245
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:41,599
FairPoint

246
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:46,463
GS change Laurie Baker's life

247
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:49,279
Because it is so damn good

248
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:54,911
And honestly I think there's a little bit of a vibe that goes throughout this episode that Jim

249
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:56,959
Is a little bit peeved

250
00:12:57,215 --> 00:12:59,007
And how much Lori like this book

251
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:00,031
This is

252
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:02,335
I think your favorite

253
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:03,359
Talk of all times

254
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:07,711
I got y'all honestly we have a lot of

255
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:09,503
We have a huge life

256
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:12,319
Lori has already read this

257
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:13,343
But she loves it

258
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:14,111
So much

259
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:17,439
She's read it twice and she's told it to me

260
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:20,255
A dozen times

261
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:28,191
I thought she'd never tell this

262
00:13:28,447 --> 00:13:29,727
It all in this book

263
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:31,775
Here's the only way I know

264
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:35,615
Is very authentic very real very open very raw

265
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:36,639
It was the hardest

266
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:37,407
Thing I've ever done

267
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:38,687
But the most rewarding

268
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:40,991
It took me 9 years

269
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:42,015
2 years

270
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:47,903
Why it took you nine years to write this book what were you liked it she was just on

271
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:53,791
Like maybe 9-10 months before this on Jim Bakker Show pushing her other book about Esther's

272
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:57,375
How do you have a time notebook

273
00:13:57,631 --> 00:13:58,143
I will

274
00:13:58,399 --> 00:13:58,911
Eat my own

275
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:01,983
I mean technically I don't have any evidence

276
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:06,079
I know I'm just saying that if she did

277
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:06,847
I don't know

278
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:08,895
Tobacco store

279
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:15,295
Let me see the f****** manuscript I don't know how she is the time

280
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:18,111
Quite frankly

281
00:14:18,367 --> 00:14:19,391
She doesn't recognize

282
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:21,183
Fitbit

283
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:23,487
So in her book she talks about

284
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:24,767
Our path through life

285
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:26,303
Early childhood

286
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:28,863
Try and stay away from like her

287
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:32,959
Call stuff cuz I don't know if it's really all that into

288
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:34,239
Interesting or all that relevant

289
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:40,895
Tortured animals

290
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:42,175
I find her story

291
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:48,575
Has to be at least identical to John Wayne Gacy is but there was just like a different

292
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:50,623
I don't know about anything

293
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:52,671
Book except for what they talk about

294
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:54,975
And mostly it just seems like

295
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:55,999
I don't know

296
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:59,327
She's living in a trailer and then she got divorced a couple times and

297
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:02,655
Bada bing bada boom here we are to study two Bibles and

298
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:05,727
Who cares

299
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:12,127
So she gets into in this next five getting kind of emotional talking about praying at the inauguration

300
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:12,895
Eurasian

301
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:14,431
After the 22

302
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:15,199
16 election

303
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:16,479
When I got there

304
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:18,271
I

305
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:19,039
Stop

306
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:22,111
Can I just say

307
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:24,159
God

308
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:25,439
I looked up the heavens

309
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:26,975
Only

310
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:27,999
You

311
00:15:28,255 --> 00:15:29,791
Boo

312
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:32,095
Stop everything I had

313
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:33,631
To do everything I needed

314
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:34,911
And I was so

315
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:35,935
Present with

316
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:36,959
That moment

317
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:38,495
Thinking it's like my whole life

318
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:39,519
Backsplash for me

319
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:41,567
Here's this former messed up Miss

320
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:42,591
Hippie girl

321
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:43,871
Lived in a trailer

322
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:46,687
Daddy committed

323
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:48,991
Pregnant out of wedlock

324
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:50,271
Been married

325
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:51,295
In divorce

326
00:15:53,855 --> 00:15:54,879
Twice that mean all this

327
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:56,415
Not everything that

328
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:57,439
People said

329
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:58,975
Me every

330
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:00,767
Should I have called you

331
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:01,535
Shake Nation

332
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:03,327
And I'm standing there

333
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:04,607
The most powerful Nation

334
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:05,375
In the world

335
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:06,911
Invoking the name of Jesus

336
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:07,679
I said

337
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:08,703
Don't care what they say

338
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:09,471
Say about me

339
00:16:09,983 --> 00:16:10,495
History

340
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:12,543
Did it work

341
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:13,311
The woman

342
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:14,847
God a female clergy

343
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:16,383
The history will record

344
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:17,151
An Impala

345
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:18,431
Came prayed for

346
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:19,455
The first time

347
00:16:19,967 --> 00:16:20,479
A female

348
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:21,503
Sergio Verdin

349
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:33,791
It feels a little narcissistic that feels a little bit like this is about me as opposed to

350
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:35,327
Other thing

351
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:37,887
Why would you why would you think that

352
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:38,655
I got a

353
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:40,703
Strong vibe in that direction

354
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:47,359
And Paul is kind of getting out of this title of first woman clergy member to pray at the inauguration thing on a technicality

355
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:49,663
After he won the 2012 election

356
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:51,711
President Obama had Merrill

357
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:54,783
Evers-williams deliver a prayer at the inauguration

358
00:16:55,295 --> 00:17:01,439
She was the former chair of the n-double-acp and was a noted civil rights activist though she was not technically a reverend

359
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:02,207
Preacher

360
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:06,303
Christianity is largely based on the idea that all people have access

361
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:09,631
What's the God and there's no need for the old structures were the clergy or interview

362
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:11,423
Media Aries to contact the divine

363
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:15,519
I'm not sure the Pollos claimed would be this big first

364
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:17,311
Billy means all that much

365
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:19,103
I would argue

366
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:20,127
That's

367
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:23,455
None of the things that she has said in that are true

368
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:26,783
A little bit

369
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:27,551
He's doing like

370
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:33,695
I'm sure some of the details of her life through and I'm shy I'm sure that there is like an emotional narrative Arc

371
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:35,743
The her life that I don't want to

372
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:36,511
Like demeanor

373
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:37,279
Because like

374
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:38,559
The idea that you did

375
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:42,911
They come from whatever humble beginnings however much

376
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:44,703
To that

377
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:45,727
Compared to how she is

378
00:17:45,983 --> 00:17:46,495
Experience

379
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:47,263
That beat

380
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:50,591
To the point that she's at now

381
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:52,127
That's her life

382
00:17:52,383 --> 00:17:53,407
And great

383
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:55,455
But

384
00:17:56,991 --> 00:17:57,759
The other

385
00:17:58,015 --> 00:17:58,783
It doesn't

386
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:01,087
It doesn't strike me as healthy

387
00:18:01,343 --> 00:18:02,367
To have someone

388
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:03,391
Be like

389
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:07,231
But it's really just your life story

390
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:09,791
This feeling of of Narcissus

391
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:14,655
Isn't that runs behind the history books will have to remember the name Paula white-cain

392
00:18:15,935 --> 00:18:17,215
That was the thing that I was list

393
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:20,031
Me to her entire little speech

394
00:18:20,543 --> 00:18:21,055
It was like

395
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:23,103
Obviously fake cry

396
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:30,015
Probably and maybe better trained than than the Alex Jones School

397
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:31,551
A crime

398
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:35,391
Female comedians become right-wing commentators in

399
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:37,951
Bad actress can become

400
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:39,999
But then

401
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:41,279
Then it got real

402
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:44,607
It got very genuine when she started talking about how

403
00:18:44,863 --> 00:18:47,167
History is going to have to remember her f****** name

404
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:53,567
Yeah and it was not emotional it was f******

405
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:55,359
I own this

406
00:18:55,615 --> 00:18:58,175
Now I dominated you

407
00:18:58,431 --> 00:18:58,943
World

408
00:18:59,199 --> 00:19:01,247
Right and that is that I did

409
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:07,903
Yeah if you know you know that you had a woman who gave the prayer at the inauguration before that so now you have to like move

410
00:19:08,159 --> 00:19:11,487
Move the goalposts a little first woman clergy

411
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:12,511
Which she's not

412
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:14,559
Technically

413
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:16,095
I don't know anyway

414
00:19:16,351 --> 00:19:18,143
Hey wait the last

415
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:20,191
Right at the feminist

416
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:21,471
All they're coming

417
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:22,495
They should be

418
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:25,567
Thrilled with Paula because you was the first woman

419
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:30,175
Parentheses clergy member

420
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:31,199
Woman

421
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:32,991
The first clergy that a woman

422
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:41,439
Was like are you kidding me

423
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:45,279
The old ass all the women livers

424
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:51,935
Burning their bras eighty-year-old man

425
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:55,519
Expressing disdain with the the present state

426
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:56,287
Yeah

427
00:19:56,543 --> 00:20:01,407
You think of suffragettes maybe rallying behind you but

428
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:03,455
They show their hypocrisy

429
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:04,735
Elizabeth Taylor

430
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:07,039
Won't shut up now we'll see

431
00:20:08,063 --> 00:20:08,575
All right Jim

432
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:12,159
Calm down so Lori loves this book

433
00:20:12,415 --> 00:20:14,207
It's going to probably shocked a lot of you

434
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:20,351
No it's it's time

435
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:21,119
Her

436
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:23,679
You mr. Non-Stop

437
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:25,471
Because that's who you are

438
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:26,495
And here's what I love

439
00:20:26,751 --> 00:20:27,263
Variable

440
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:28,031
About you

441
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:30,079
If I laugh

442
00:20:31,615 --> 00:20:33,407
Amen I love you

443
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:38,015
Amen oh God Amen

444
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:40,319
We had him amen

445
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:42,367
So very

446
00:20:43,135 --> 00:20:49,279
Comforting thought Laurel and Hardy two-man game right there first banana second banana that was going I was going for

447
00:20:49,535 --> 00:20:50,303
Pretty well

448
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:52,607
So all this is

449
00:20:52,863 --> 00:20:53,631
Like the first

450
00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:54,911
Half

451
00:20:55,935 --> 00:20:56,447
Is Joe

452
00:20:56,959 --> 00:20:59,007
Is just selling this book

453
00:20:59,263 --> 00:21:03,871
Like I understand we'll make an

454
00:21:04,127 --> 00:21:04,895
I suppose

455
00:21:05,151 --> 00:21:06,431
Some of the presentation

456
00:21:06,687 --> 00:21:07,711
Is that this book

457
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:08,479
Highlights

458
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:10,783
Biblical principles or something

459
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:12,575
And then you could say by proxy

460
00:21:12,831 --> 00:21:14,111
You're being a religious program

461
00:21:14,623 --> 00:21:18,720
But in reality in function and inform this is an infomercial for her book

462
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:20,768
That is all that's going on

463
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,816
You are truly the greater

464
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:23,584
This woman

465
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:24,608
Preacher I have

466
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:25,376
Ever heard

467
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:27,424
And I believe

468
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:28,960
With all my heart

469
00:21:29,216 --> 00:21:31,520
I've seen and heard the best

470
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:33,312
You have a gift

471
00:21:33,568 --> 00:21:37,920
I feel bad for Tammy Faye

472
00:21:38,176 --> 00:21:42,016
Sojourner Truth

473
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:45,344
Doesn't leave you when your marriage breaks up

474
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,136
It doesn't leave you when people

475
00:21:47,392 --> 00:21:47,904
When the

476
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:51,488
FBI comes to try to hit you up in prison she want all that by the

477
00:21:52,512 --> 00:21:54,816
But this is why I want you to read this book

478
00:21:55,584 --> 00:21:56,352
Did I'm really

479
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:57,120
Really

480
00:21:57,376 --> 00:21:57,888
Angry

481
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,168
But what happened to you

482
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:01,728
Because I've been there and done a lot of that

483
00:22:01,984 --> 00:22:04,544
God

484
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,336
Amen

485
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:07,872
He's talking about like

486
00:22:08,128 --> 00:22:12,224
People investigating him for financial malfeasance

487
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:18,624
I've been there I cheated on a lot of s*** too that's what I'm really

488
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:21,952
This book is so good I mean this book is great

489
00:22:26,048 --> 00:22:30,912
Yeah there is a real sense to throughout this interview of them being like

490
00:22:31,168 --> 00:22:36,288
Yeah it look IRS and the FEDS are trying to snatch us up for this crime and

491
00:22:36,544 --> 00:22:37,824
Look I commit crimes

492
00:22:40,128 --> 00:22:43,456
They're trying to get me for any but I'm doing good

493
00:22:43,712 --> 00:22:47,040
I feel bad about the sins that are b b y

494
00:22:47,296 --> 00:22:50,368
So a lot in her life

495
00:22:50,624 --> 00:22:52,672
And I'm not going to sit here and

496
00:22:52,928 --> 00:22:54,208
Make fun of her for

497
00:22:54,464 --> 00:22:55,232
Personal struggles

498
00:22:56,256 --> 00:22:56,768
But

499
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,560
I am going to critique

500
00:22:59,072 --> 00:23:00,096
The used

501
00:23:00,352 --> 00:23:03,168
Of those personal struggles in order to sell her book

502
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:04,704
Jim Bakker Show

503
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:05,728
When we get

504
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:10,080
Attacked in every area that you can imagine but thought of giving prophetic word

505
00:23:10,336 --> 00:23:15,712
And said everything around you will be Shake yes and everything around you will fall but you will remain standing in the merger

506
00:23:15,968 --> 00:23:18,272
I'm telling you it is not over

507
00:23:18,528 --> 00:23:21,344
For you you need this book you need the series

508
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:27,744
Because when you get it you're going to discover The God Who before you ever entered into your mother's womb at all

509
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,536
Already ordained all of your days

510
00:23:29,792 --> 00:23:35,936
And your story ends in God's glory and I'm promising you different this summer you're going to find

511
00:23:36,192 --> 00:23:36,960
Weather on your best

512
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:43,360
Trend your sister your Mentor your coach or Pastor they were going to hold hands together cuz it is not my story

513
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:44,640
Thoughts Tory

514
00:23:44,896 --> 00:23:46,688
Through my life and through your life

515
00:23:46,944 --> 00:23:47,712
How we can make it

516
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:48,992
Through it

517
00:23:49,248 --> 00:23:51,040
This is like to me

518
00:23:51,296 --> 00:23:52,576
Right on the cusp

519
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:53,600
Of like

520
00:23:53,856 --> 00:23:55,136
What I'm uncomfortable

521
00:23:55,904 --> 00:23:57,952
Because there is a part of it that is

522
00:23:58,208 --> 00:24:01,792
I have lived experience I wrote about it and

523
00:24:02,048 --> 00:24:05,120
You know if you buy my book maybe it'll help you with something you're going through

524
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:07,936
I don't really think it's that bad

525
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:13,312
Which is I know enough about her and Jim Bakker that I think it's bad

526
00:24:13,568 --> 00:24:15,616
The surrounding context

527
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:16,384
Makes it

528
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,176
Prasser

529
00:24:18,432 --> 00:24:20,992
And way more manipulative then it would be if

530
00:24:21,248 --> 00:24:23,808
Just somebody else were saying those things

531
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:24,832
Because I think

532
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:26,368
You can't get a lot out of memoir

533
00:24:26,624 --> 00:24:28,416
I think a lot of people

534
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:30,208
You've been through experiences

535
00:24:30,464 --> 00:24:33,280
That mirror yours or ones that are far more

536
00:24:33,536 --> 00:24:35,840
Stream than yours but highlight certain license

537
00:24:36,096 --> 00:24:38,912
In life I think there's a lot you can gain from that

538
00:24:39,168 --> 00:24:40,192
I just

539
00:24:40,704 --> 00:24:41,216
I just don't

540
00:24:41,984 --> 00:24:42,752
I think that this is

541
00:24:43,008 --> 00:24:45,568
A good place for it

542
00:24:46,592 --> 00:24:47,360
I find it

543
00:24:47,872 --> 00:24:48,896
Incredibly disgusting

544
00:24:49,408 --> 00:24:50,688
Cuz I

545
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,504
I've been to so many different places where people

546
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:54,784
Genuinely believe

547
00:24:55,552 --> 00:24:57,088
So hard at all of this s***

548
00:24:58,112 --> 00:24:59,136
They do not

549
00:24:59,392 --> 00:25:01,440
They just don't give a s*** about

550
00:25:01,696 --> 00:25:02,720
Any of that

551
00:25:03,232 --> 00:25:04,512
I can't you can hear her

552
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,560
Words clocked in

553
00:25:07,584 --> 00:25:08,096
Like

554
00:25:08,352 --> 00:25:08,864
F******

555
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,400
Weird imitation of an

556
00:25:10,656 --> 00:25:11,680
Actual believer

557
00:25:12,192 --> 00:25:14,240
Now you know it it feels that way

558
00:25:16,288 --> 00:25:16,800
Slimy

559
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:18,592
Every time she

560
00:25:18,848 --> 00:25:19,616
Speaks I feel like

561
00:25:20,128 --> 00:25:21,664
Who is falling off of her work

562
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:22,688
He's going to get roast

563
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,480
Groats

564
00:25:25,248 --> 00:25:26,784
Say that I don't

565
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:28,064
Think that that

566
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,600
Behaviorism

567
00:25:29,856 --> 00:25:30,624
Licitly

568
00:25:31,136 --> 00:25:32,672
Grocer manipulative

569
00:25:33,184 --> 00:25:34,464
But it is in the context

570
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:35,232
Of this

571
00:25:35,488 --> 00:25:38,816
Because we know that she's somebody who asks for your January paycheck

572
00:25:39,072 --> 00:25:41,632
Or there'll be consequences

573
00:25:41,888 --> 00:25:43,424
Trump's spiritual advisor

574
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:47,264
And we know I know what's coming up

575
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:52,384
On first glance that doesn't

576
00:25:53,664 --> 00:25:54,176
To be that bad

577
00:25:54,688 --> 00:25:58,272
Yeah Patterson's going to drop in with a couple n-bomb

578
00:25:58,528 --> 00:26:00,064
But this book like I said

579
00:26:00,832 --> 00:26:01,600
Lori Bakker

580
00:26:01,856 --> 00:26:02,368
Life

581
00:26:03,648 --> 00:26:05,952
Changed your life this book

582
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:07,744
Yes Lori

583
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:08,512
Yes

584
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:10,048
You don't use get beat up

585
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:11,840
Yeah you had divorce

586
00:26:12,096 --> 00:26:12,608
Shoe had

587
00:26:12,864 --> 00:26:13,376
You know

588
00:26:13,888 --> 00:26:15,936
I mean

589
00:26:16,448 --> 00:26:16,960
This is

590
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:18,496
What she was a wild woman

591
00:26:19,008 --> 00:26:20,032
Drugs Beyond any

592
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,080
If the Heartbreak

593
00:26:22,336 --> 00:26:22,848
Centerline

594
00:26:23,616 --> 00:26:24,128
And yet

595
00:26:24,384 --> 00:26:27,456
When she first got saved they asked her to be an angel

596
00:26:27,968 --> 00:26:30,784
That fly

597
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:35,648
And some pictures

598
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,488
But you are an angel my angel but you

599
00:26:40,256 --> 00:26:41,024
Ashiya

600
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,048
This book

601
00:26:42,304 --> 00:26:48,448
You tell women that paddle boards and women have had anything and we hadn't gone through anything Penny just booked is going to let you know

602
00:26:48,704 --> 00:26:49,472
God

603
00:26:49,728 --> 00:26:51,520
Does not walk away

604
00:26:52,288 --> 00:26:58,432
Because not he's not letting Lori speak for herself that much I've noticed that trends

605
00:26:58,688 --> 00:27:04,832
He seems to be talking over her a lot whenever talking about her personal experiences

606
00:27:05,088 --> 00:27:06,880
Don't make me feel all that comfortable

607
00:27:07,136 --> 00:27:10,720
He's very much talking about her like she's not there and then suddenly remembering the

608
00:27:11,488 --> 00:27:13,536
Or not even recognizing there with you

609
00:27:14,816 --> 00:27:16,096
That goes on throughout this

610
00:27:16,352 --> 00:27:19,424
Drugs more than anything she did a wife

611
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:20,192
Did a

612
00:27:20,448 --> 00:27:21,216
Heart of drugs

613
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:25,568
Hey how you doing you're an angel you're an

614
00:27:25,824 --> 00:27:31,968
Angel she loved it heroin you name it there's nothing wrong with doing drugs there's nothing wrong with

615
00:27:32,224 --> 00:27:33,760
Taking lessons

616
00:27:34,016 --> 00:27:34,528
From

617
00:27:34,784 --> 00:27:36,064
Earlier mistakes

618
00:27:36,576 --> 00:27:37,600
Inform your future life

619
00:27:38,112 --> 00:27:42,976
Anything like that I'm not interested in beating people up for reclaiming negative experiences

620
00:27:43,232 --> 00:27:44,000
Isn't turning the positive

621
00:27:45,024 --> 00:27:45,792
I don't like this

622
00:27:46,048 --> 00:27:46,560
Mentality though

623
00:27:47,072 --> 00:27:50,144
People don't value our Brokenness right but you're not even

624
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,936
Qualified into you walk

625
00:27:52,192 --> 00:27:55,520
That's it you're not even

626
00:27:55,776 --> 00:27:58,336
Karaoke in process

627
00:27:58,848 --> 00:28:00,896
I don't know if I appreciate

628
00:28:01,152 --> 00:28:01,920
The idea that you

629
00:28:02,176 --> 00:28:02,944
She's putting forth

630
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,736
That you're not qualified

631
00:28:04,992 --> 00:28:05,504
To be in a min

632
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:08,320
Ministerial role unless you have some sort of 8

633
00:28:08,576 --> 00:28:09,088
Trauma-based

634
00:28:09,344 --> 00:28:10,112
Initiation

635
00:28:10,368 --> 00:28:11,904
Into being

636
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,208
I don't even know what

637
00:28:14,464 --> 00:28:14,976
You'd like

638
00:28:16,512 --> 00:28:18,560
That's if that's offensive okay so what happened

639
00:28:20,096 --> 00:28:21,120
You go to the church

640
00:28:21,376 --> 00:28:22,912
Yeah after Sunday service

641
00:28:23,424 --> 00:28:24,192
About 23

642
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:30,336
And then the rest of the the elders the deacons in the like they'll circle around you and start

643
00:28:30,848 --> 00:28:32,384
Can you until you gallon of cereal name

644
00:28:32,896 --> 00:28:34,432
I'm sure you are eligible to be

645
00:28:34,688 --> 00:28:38,016
Be in the clear if you haven't

646
00:28:38,272 --> 00:28:38,784
Suffered

647
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:45,184
Some horrible trauma but you feel called to the ministry

648
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:50,048
Facturar trauma in order to become eligible to be a part of him

649
00:28:50,304 --> 00:28:53,376
The cloth you could also just read a lot of Stephen King novels

650
00:28:53,632 --> 00:28:54,144
Get really

651
00:28:54,656 --> 00:28:56,448
I don't think that also

652
00:28:57,984 --> 00:28:59,264
No

653
00:29:00,288 --> 00:29:00,800
Not

654
00:29:01,056 --> 00:29:04,896
I don't I don't like that mentality I do

655
00:29:05,152 --> 00:29:06,176
I think it would

656
00:29:06,432 --> 00:29:06,944
Trying to

657
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,504
Express is that you aren't your bat your past

658
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:10,272
Damages

659
00:29:10,528 --> 00:29:12,064
Is your past traumatic experience

660
00:29:12,832 --> 00:29:13,344
You like

661
00:29:14,624 --> 00:29:18,208
Feels like what's intended to be said there is a reclamation

662
00:29:20,256 --> 00:29:21,792
I'm being overly generous

663
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:23,840
You if you hear

664
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:24,864
Hear it that way

665
00:29:25,632 --> 00:29:28,192
Good if the message is

666
00:29:28,704 --> 00:29:29,728
Just because

667
00:29:29,984 --> 00:29:34,336
I don't know I got divorced when I was younger that doesn't mean that I'm not good enough

668
00:29:34,592 --> 00:29:35,616
To do whatever I need

669
00:29:35,872 --> 00:29:39,712
To do or whatever I'm called to do whatever I trying to do

670
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,504
That's a positive message

671
00:29:42,016 --> 00:29:43,808
But when is expressed as

672
00:29:44,064 --> 00:29:45,856
In order to get to that role

673
00:29:46,112 --> 00:29:50,720
It's a prerequisite that you have drama

674
00:29:51,488 --> 00:29:53,792
If the inverse of what I think the message

675
00:29:54,304 --> 00:29:54,816
Supposed to be

676
00:29:55,584 --> 00:29:58,912
Right yeah all I'm all I'm hearing her say is like

677
00:29:59,424 --> 00:29:59,936
Be

678
00:30:01,728 --> 00:30:03,008
The only way that

679
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:06,592
Like almost again as though she's the intermediary

680
00:30:06,848 --> 00:30:08,896
As opposed to everyone having an open relationship

681
00:30:09,408 --> 00:30:12,224
It was God. He is the intermediate because

682
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,760
You are unqualified

683
00:30:14,016 --> 00:30:15,808
You've you've been fine you don't have that

684
00:30:16,832 --> 00:30:17,600
You can't really talk to

685
00:30:18,112 --> 00:30:20,672
It's not until you have that serious goodshit

686
00:30:20,928 --> 00:30:23,232
You know that's whenever you get to really f***

687
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,280
For him

688
00:30:25,792 --> 00:30:26,304
Maybe

689
00:30:26,816 --> 00:30:28,096
So they're selling this book and it's

690
00:30:28,352 --> 00:30:28,864
It's not just work

691
00:30:30,656 --> 00:30:31,168
Therapy

692
00:30:31,424 --> 00:30:37,568
Okay there's pictures

693
00:30:37,824 --> 00:30:43,712
Pictures of Bonnie

694
00:30:44,224 --> 00:30:46,016
Rare color pictures

695
00:30:46,272 --> 00:30:52,160
What are we f****** doing we're selling a book George this is bad for selling a book

696
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:53,952
And not just that

697
00:30:54,208 --> 00:30:55,488
With this set of knives

698
00:30:55,744 --> 00:30:57,024
We will also add in

699
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:58,048
And working out

700
00:30:59,584 --> 00:31:00,352
Holler pictures

701
00:31:01,632 --> 00:31:04,960
What's worse in the Halls

702
00:31:05,472 --> 00:31:08,032
Power right now he's talked to presidents

703
00:31:08,288 --> 00:31:09,056
Yes

704
00:31:09,312 --> 00:31:09,824
Before he went further

705
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:10,848
And prison guards

706
00:31:11,104 --> 00:31:15,200
I talked to both in the highest call Bruce Wiley was a cellmate in prison

707
00:31:15,968 --> 00:31:18,784
He knows that a lot of

708
00:31:19,552 --> 00:31:20,832
High-end people don't

709
00:31:22,112 --> 00:31:22,624
Right

710
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:24,672
I know what

711
00:31:25,696 --> 00:31:26,720
Real real high

712
00:31:26,976 --> 00:31:27,744
I hate your type

713
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:28,512
Church people

714
00:31:29,536 --> 00:31:30,816
They don't want to be around us

715
00:31:34,656 --> 00:31:35,680
Charismatic type people

716
00:31:36,192 --> 00:31:37,216
And so

717
00:31:38,752 --> 00:31:39,776
Spirit-filled

718
00:31:40,032 --> 00:31:40,544
Fire god

719
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:42,336
He would always watch your program

720
00:31:42,592 --> 00:31:43,104
He would watch

721
00:31:44,384 --> 00:31:45,152
The most on

722
00:31:45,408 --> 00:31:46,176
Fire

00:31:46,432 --> 00:31:47,712

And talk about loyalty

730
00:32:04,608 --> 00:32:06,144

One of the Trump building

741
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:32,768
Fake news and then say you can't buy loyalty but you have

00:32:47,104 --> 00:32:48,128
Course

747
00:32:48,384 --> 00:32:49,664
It's alright

748
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:51,968
Of course it's a great operator

749
00:32:53,248 --> 00:32:53,760
Rate scale

750
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:56,320
Keepsake keep losing money

751
00:32:56,576 --> 00:32:57,600
Working with properties

752
00:32:57,856 --> 00:32:58,624
You didn't even realize you

753
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:02,720
You could just say you owe me money or you'll die and then it's fine

754
00:33:02,976 --> 00:33:07,584
You didn't realize that so you noticed that

755
00:33:08,352 --> 00:33:09,632
I think the exact thing

756
00:33:09,888 --> 00:33:14,240
It's like the high-end religious people people in these Halls of power don't want to hang out with us

757
00:33:14,496 --> 00:33:15,520
Charismatic

758
00:33:15,776 --> 00:33:18,848
Well yeah there's a reason you you're embarrassing

759
00:33:19,104 --> 00:33:20,128
But not just that mean

760
00:33:20,384 --> 00:33:22,176
Literally described using

761
00:33:22,432 --> 00:33:24,480
Charismatic type people

762
00:33:24,992 --> 00:33:27,552
Confidence but it's but he's used he couldn't

763
00:33:27,808 --> 00:33:31,136
Stop himself from finding synonyms for the thing that he is

764
00:33:32,416 --> 00:33:38,560
Yeah I prefer a society where are serious people don't want to be associated

765
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:40,352
Did with people like this like it's

766
00:33:40,864 --> 00:33:41,632
It's a better

767
00:33:41,888 --> 00:33:43,680
It's better if that wall exist

768
00:33:43,936 --> 00:33:46,240
Build That Wall

769
00:33:47,264 --> 00:33:50,080
So Apollo starts talking about Trump going to

770
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,384
Are you ghosts these churches

771
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:55,712
Really

772
00:33:55,968 --> 00:33:56,736
Batman he'll tell me like

773
00:33:57,248 --> 00:33:58,784
To the church against Apollo

774
00:33:59,296 --> 00:34:00,064
A boring

775
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:01,088
Egos

776
00:34:01,344 --> 00:34:03,904
I went cuz I wanted to hear about Jesus

777
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:05,952
He said they talked about their dog and

778
00:34:08,256 --> 00:34:10,560
About Jesus

779
00:34:10,816 --> 00:34:12,864
I said there's a whole nother side that yes

780
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:13,632
Do you mind

781
00:34:13,888 --> 00:34:16,704
See the public Persona he's strong don't don't get me wrong

782
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,752
I mean I would never get in the boxing ring

783
00:34:19,008 --> 00:34:19,776
That's for sure

784
00:34:20,032 --> 00:34:20,800
You know he didn't

785
00:34:21,056 --> 00:34:22,336
He doesn't start the fight

786
00:34:22,848 --> 00:34:28,992
But he probably will finish it so then I think we need someone like that right now

787
00:34:29,248 --> 00:34:30,016
That's what's up

788
00:34:30,272 --> 00:34:31,808
The Bible advocates for

789
00:34:32,064 --> 00:34:34,112
Hey what's up with times get tough

790
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:35,648
Get a boxer

791
00:34:36,928 --> 00:34:37,952
Turn the other cheek

792
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:41,280
Park Your Right Hook

793
00:34:41,792 --> 00:34:44,096
Yeah it's interesting

794
00:34:44,352 --> 00:34:45,120
To me they like yeah

795
00:34:45,376 --> 00:34:47,424
Can I go see Church's I once talked about their dog

796
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:52,544
You've been selling a book for half an hour I wanted to hear about Jesus

797
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,080
No

798
00:34:54,336 --> 00:34:55,616
Jesus is in the book

799
00:34:56,128 --> 00:34:57,408
We're going to talk mostly about

800
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,968
I love that she has apparently been

801
00:35:00,224 --> 00:35:00,736
Given carte blanche

802
00:35:01,248 --> 00:35:05,856
To just lie about whatever the president

803
00:35:06,112 --> 00:35:09,696
The Office of Public liaison because Jordan

804
00:35:09,952 --> 00:35:10,976
Let's break this down

805
00:35:11,488 --> 00:35:12,000
This is a

806
00:35:12,256 --> 00:35:14,816
Crass attempt to appeal to Evangelical

807
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:19,424
All of this is an attempt to like

808
00:35:19,936 --> 00:35:20,448
Really

809
00:35:21,216 --> 00:35:21,984
Pull that bass

810
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:24,544
Back together

811
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:27,360
Because that's one of the only shots there is for the

812
00:35:28,384 --> 00:35:30,176
Is like making the

813
00:35:30,432 --> 00:35:31,456
Not end of Christy

814
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:37,856
Sienna T really really afraid of losing this election

815
00:35:38,624 --> 00:35:39,904
Bike this is

816
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:41,184
Campaigning

817
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:47,072
There's no way around it this is everybody this is disgusting

818
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:53,472
You also sell her books she's brilliant yes she is male

819
00:35:53,728 --> 00:35:55,008
About that book

820
00:35:55,776 --> 00:35:56,544
It's written by a woman

821
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:57,568
Are there pictures in

822
00:35:57,824 --> 00:35:59,360
There are color pictures which is very rare

823
00:36:00,128 --> 00:36:00,896
It's right by one

824
00:36:01,152 --> 00:36:01,920
Okay right

825
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,736
Change This Woman's life

826
00:36:05,248 --> 00:36:07,552
Bright Corey Baker's wife

827
00:36:07,808 --> 00:36:08,576
She lives in a comp

828
00:36:09,088 --> 00:36:09,600
Here's the thing

829
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:11,136
Do you make Jim's like

830
00:36:11,392 --> 00:36:11,904
Might be a

831
00:36:12,928 --> 00:36:15,488
I don't think it's a checkbook but it's a checkbook

832
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:22,144
If I kind of say I don't know I really do

833
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,424
I promise you it's

834
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:28,032
The page-turner broken women should read it

835
00:36:28,544 --> 00:36:31,104
I love the idea that he's saying that this is a chick book

836
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:36,736
He's not your it's a checkbook over Lori which he's trying to recommend the book

837
00:36:36,992 --> 00:36:38,272
Very disrespectful

838
00:36:38,784 --> 00:36:41,088
The amount that he talks over his wife

839
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:44,928
And introduces his daughter as Tammy Sue Bakker

840
00:36:45,184 --> 00:36:49,792
Very weird this familial relationship

841
00:36:50,816 --> 00:36:54,400
I don't I don't want to say that there's no love there cuz I'm sure there is

842
00:36:54,656 --> 00:36:56,704
But did they have to be sure there

843
00:36:57,216 --> 00:37:01,312
There could be none and I would be fine but I don't have any evidence of that and it's

844
00:37:01,568 --> 00:37:02,336
It'd be very ER

845
00:37:02,592 --> 00:37:04,384
Disrespectful and inappropriate

846
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,224
Here are like there is

847
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:11,040
If there is a very strong fan

848
00:37:11,552 --> 00:37:12,832
Unit it doesn't

849
00:37:13,088 --> 00:37:13,600
Translate to the show

850
00:37:14,112 --> 00:37:16,928
There is a there is sort of a

851
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:22,048
Separation of on show behavior and Affair Behavior

852
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:24,352
That must be there or else

853
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:26,144
This just seems like

854
00:37:27,424 --> 00:37:28,192
Weird people

855
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:29,216
Related

856
00:37:29,472 --> 00:37:30,496
Relate to each other it is

857
00:37:31,776 --> 00:37:33,312
It's

858
00:37:34,336 --> 00:37:35,360
If you put it in this term

859
00:37:35,872 --> 00:37:37,152
This is basically they're off

860
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:40,736
I know plenty of offices with complete strangers

861
00:37:40,992 --> 00:37:42,528
Who love each other far more than beef

862
00:37:43,808 --> 00:37:44,576
This is

863
00:37:44,832 --> 00:37:46,112
Weird business

864
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:50,464
Situation

865
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,280
So I don't

866
00:37:54,048 --> 00:37:54,816
Agree with

867
00:37:55,072 --> 00:37:55,584
A purse

868
00:37:56,352 --> 00:37:56,864
But

869
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:58,400
Paula White Cain

870
00:37:58,656 --> 00:37:59,168
Does not believe

871
00:37:59,424 --> 00:37:59,936
Leave the cheese in

872
00:38:00,192 --> 00:38:00,704
The politics

873
00:38:02,752 --> 00:38:03,264
Consider myself

874
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:04,032
New Politics

875
00:38:04,544 --> 00:38:05,312
I do people

876
00:38:05,824 --> 00:38:06,848
I Say Yes to God

877
00:38:07,616 --> 00:38:08,640
18 years ago

878
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:10,432
Story

879
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:11,456
The Lord spoke

880
00:38:11,712 --> 00:38:12,736
To me and said

881
00:38:13,248 --> 00:38:13,760
Regarding

882
00:38:14,784 --> 00:38:16,064
Trump show him who I am

883
00:38:16,832 --> 00:38:22,976
This is how you reveal the religious conduit con man

884
00:38:23,232 --> 00:38:24,000
Not fair

885
00:38:24,256 --> 00:38:28,864
This is how you do like 18 years ago God said get involved with this Trump guy

886
00:38:29,376 --> 00:38:32,704
She goes in that starts talking to him and through their relations

887
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:34,496
Zippy realizes like a man

888
00:38:34,752 --> 00:38:38,848
Religion could be a grift

889
00:38:40,128 --> 00:38:44,992
We made a gentlemen's agreements and nothing is in writing of course I debit I gave her

890
00:38:45,248 --> 00:38:47,040
Proof-of-concept

891
00:38:47,808 --> 00:38:48,320
Anyway

892
00:38:50,112 --> 00:38:50,624
Cephalexin

893
00:38:51,648 --> 00:38:52,672
And hopefully it goes

894
00:38:53,184 --> 00:38:55,488
She's not into it's not her thing she does

895
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:56,512
She does people

896
00:38:57,536 --> 00:38:58,560
Politic right

897
00:38:58,816 --> 00:38:59,328
It's

898
00:38:59,584 --> 00:39:00,352
Decades

899
00:39:00,864 --> 00:39:02,144
Centuries-long

900
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,192
Spiritual conflict

901
00:39:04,448 --> 00:39:07,520
It is a battle of righteousness and wickedness and it did not

902
00:39:07,776 --> 00:39:09,056
Start with President Trump

903
00:39:09,312 --> 00:39:10,336
This is Ben

904
00:39:10,592 --> 00:39:14,176
Battle tried to take this nation cuz if this nation goes

905
00:39:14,432 --> 00:39:16,736
Down I'm telling you this nation

906
00:39:16,992 --> 00:39:20,576
Don't get me started see if this nation goes down

907
00:39:20,832 --> 00:39:25,184
So we are the hope to this world because this nation was dedicated with little white

908
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:25,952
Crosses

909
00:39:26,208 --> 00:39:28,000
That were marked along the beaches

910
00:39:28,256 --> 00:39:34,400
Down my Virginia Beach then Plymouth that were marked that should we dedicate this plan to take the gospel to the nations in

911
00:39:34,656 --> 00:39:40,800
Then once the gospel taken to the Neches we ushered into the return of the Lord and so yes they want this light to go.

912
00:39:41,056 --> 00:39:47,200
Dim in America because if we do not be the Beacon of Hope to the world if we do not take the gospel to the world

913
00:39:47,456 --> 00:39:47,968
Then

914
00:39:48,224 --> 00:39:54,368
There's a Darkness but I believe that we are not going to go through a period where there is a 400-year of shut

915
00:39:54,624 --> 00:40:00,000
Doors or windows were have perilous time I believe we are ushering in the Great Awakening and we will

916
00:40:00,256 --> 00:40:01,280
See the greatest

917
00:40:01,536 --> 00:40:02,304
Is Harvest ever

918
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:03,328
And there's a fight

919
00:40:03,584 --> 00:40:04,864
You're going to get me started

920
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:06,400
I think you got started

921
00:40:06,656 --> 00:40:11,776
Wow I hear they're just sort of a endorsement of religious Colonial is

922
00:40:13,824 --> 00:40:16,640
I believe that this is a fundamentally Christian Nation

923
00:40:17,408 --> 00:40:23,040
And that somehow our existence as a Christian Nation is a prerequisite for the return of

924
00:40:23,552 --> 00:40:24,064
Yes

925
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:30,464
I don't like that she's working in the White House is working in the governor

926
00:40:31,488 --> 00:40:36,608
I think that what she just said is something that somebody says a week before they start burning immigrants

927
00:40:36,864 --> 00:40:38,400
Like that is a terrifying

928
00:40:38,656 --> 00:40:40,704
Study different from Alex

929
00:40:41,216 --> 00:40:46,336
Hairstyles long spiritual warfare between Good and Evil

930
00:40:46,592 --> 00:40:50,944
America is a Christian Nation is very very close to what Alex

931
00:40:51,968 --> 00:40:54,016
I wouldn't want him working in the white house either

932
00:40:54,272 --> 00:40:54,784
For now

933
00:40:59,648 --> 00:41:00,928
I get that people think that it's

934
00:41:01,952 --> 00:41:02,720
Or that

935
00:41:02,976 --> 00:41:04,768
I mean to us it's more important

936
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:06,816
But if you truly believe in God

937
00:41:07,072 --> 00:41:09,376
Him giving a s*** about an election

938
00:41:09,888 --> 00:41:10,400
Is the same as him

939
00:41:10,912 --> 00:41:11,680
You should about whether or not

940
00:41:12,192 --> 00:41:12,704
The Cowboys win

941
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:13,728
Yeah I like

942
00:41:14,752 --> 00:41:19,872
It's infinite guys to an extent it's in the way that you get around that is

943
00:41:20,128 --> 00:41:20,896
Is that you make the argument

944
00:41:21,408 --> 00:41:21,920
In some way

945
00:41:22,176 --> 00:41:23,968
That if Trump wins

946
00:41:24,224 --> 00:41:25,504
He'll be able to

947
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:26,528
Italy reshape the

948
00:41:26,784 --> 00:41:27,552
The entire government

949
00:41:28,064 --> 00:41:30,368
And turn it into the Christian government that God

950
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:34,208
Wants to exist on Earth and has wanted for all the time

951
00:41:34,464 --> 00:41:35,488
No but he doesn't

952
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,536
Well you would say that

953
00:41:37,792 --> 00:41:39,840
Because he didn't say

954
00:41:40,096 --> 00:41:40,864
Paula disagrees

955
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:44,192
Well

956
00:41:44,448 --> 00:41:45,984
We could go in circles

957
00:41:46,752 --> 00:41:49,312
But that's how you sell that's how you sell the importance

958
00:41:49,568 --> 00:41:50,848
Do it like yeah you know in the next

959
00:41:51,104 --> 00:41:51,872
4 years of trump

960
00:41:52,128 --> 00:41:52,640
Stays in

961
00:41:52,895 --> 00:41:57,759
It'll be even more Supreme Court Justices that he's able to appoint and then what happens then

962
00:41:58,015 --> 00:42:04,159
Bada-bing bada-boom all these liberal laws goes or what go away Voting Rights Act is thrown out civil rights

963
00:42:04,415 --> 00:42:10,559
Electrode out controls on churches being running schemes Johnson Amendment

964
00:42:10,815 --> 00:42:12,351
Abortion gone

965
00:42:12,607 --> 00:42:18,751
Absolutely I will turn this into a Utopia for a fusion

966
00:42:19,007 --> 00:42:20,799
I don't know somebody

967
00:42:21,311 --> 00:42:23,615
Got millions of dollars in the works in the White House

968
00:42:24,127 --> 00:42:26,943
Yeah that's not to say that Trump being

969
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:27,967
In office

970
00:42:28,223 --> 00:42:29,247
44 more years

971
00:42:29,503 --> 00:42:31,807
That that possibility would bring that

972
00:42:33,087 --> 00:42:33,599
The sales pitch

973
00:42:34,111 --> 00:42:34,879
2

974
00:42:35,391 --> 00:42:36,671
People who Paulo is talking

975
00:42:36,927 --> 00:42:38,975
We can transform this country

976
00:42:39,487 --> 00:42:39,999
Into a

977
00:42:40,255 --> 00:42:41,791
Well let's not say theocracy

978
00:42:42,047 --> 00:42:47,167
Because we believe that that has a loaded word chili enchilada

979
00:42:47,423 --> 00:42:49,215
In in Form and Function

980
00:42:49,471 --> 00:42:50,239
This could be

981
00:42:50,751 --> 00:42:51,519
Christian theocracy

982
00:42:52,287 --> 00:42:52,799
If

983
00:42:53,055 --> 00:42:54,591
Do you have enough time

984
00:42:54,847 --> 00:42:56,895
All I'm so that's why it's life-or-death

985
00:42:57,151 --> 00:42:57,663
If

986
00:42:58,431 --> 00:42:59,199
Trump loses

987
00:42:59,711 --> 00:43:02,527
All the good stuff that he's done gets rolled back

988
00:43:02,783 --> 00:43:04,319
Whenever the next person comes in

989
00:43:05,087 --> 00:43:09,183
So that's that's how you turn it into something more important than a Cowboys game but yes

990
00:43:09,695 --> 00:43:10,463
For you and me

991
00:43:10,975 --> 00:43:11,743
It does seem absurd

992
00:43:14,047 --> 00:43:16,351
That's the God Is A Thousand Years

993
00:43:16,863 --> 00:43:17,375
Yeah

994
00:43:18,399 --> 00:43:18,911
Wait

995
00:43:20,447 --> 00:43:26,079
Okay now I got it I was heard that I always heard that the other this is the whole proof of the pudding is in the eating

996
00:43:26,335 --> 00:43:28,639
Situations M the god of the Dead

997
00:43:29,407 --> 00:43:31,967
I might just be quoting a Rizzo lyrics

998
00:43:32,223 --> 00:43:37,087
Anyway

999
00:43:37,343 --> 00:43:40,415
I'd like to read from Wu-Tang 416

1000
00:43:41,695 --> 00:43:44,255
But the big thing is like this idea that

1001
00:43:44,511 --> 00:43:46,815
Trump be in office will allow

1002
00:43:47,071 --> 00:43:49,375
Rollbacks of reproductive right

1003
00:43:50,399 --> 00:43:50,911
Essentially

1004
00:43:51,423 --> 00:43:53,215
That's one of the major selling

1005
00:43:53,983 --> 00:43:55,519
Impala get to that a little bit

1006
00:43:56,031 --> 00:44:00,127
They want to fight President Trump because of what he's standing for when you or the most

1007
00:44:00,383 --> 00:44:02,687
Pro-life president ever

1008
00:44:02,943 --> 00:44:05,247
So when you were looking at all at least others

1009
00:44:07,295 --> 00:44:08,063
The biblical

1010
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:14,463
Pay attention ask God to download to you

1011
00:44:14,719 --> 00:44:15,743
When you are willing

1012
00:44:15,999 --> 00:44:19,071
To abort a baby at 9 months I don't like the sex

1013
00:44:19,327 --> 00:44:21,119
Skillet that called Murder

1014
00:44:21,375 --> 00:44:23,423
But yet if a person is pregnant

1015
00:44:23,679 --> 00:44:28,543
You can a double and then you kill them is considered a double homicide now watch him a spirit

1016
00:44:28,799 --> 00:44:29,311
Standpoint

1017
00:44:29,567 --> 00:44:30,079
You're only

1018
00:44:30,335 --> 00:44:30,847
To Nation

1019
00:44:31,615 --> 00:44:32,383
That would do later

1020
00:44:32,639 --> 00:44:33,151
Portion

1021
00:44:33,663 --> 00:44:34,175
2

1022
00:44:34,687 --> 00:44:35,455
In this world

1023
00:44:35,711 --> 00:44:36,991
And wontons lessening

1024
00:44:37,503 --> 00:44:38,015
2

1025
00:44:38,271 --> 00:44:38,783
You ready

1026
00:44:39,039 --> 00:44:40,575
So now you know it from a spiritual

1027
00:44:41,087 --> 00:44:41,855
North Korea

1028
00:44:42,111 --> 00:44:43,391
In China

1029
00:44:43,647 --> 00:44:49,791
Paula is a damn liar liar

1030
00:44:50,559 --> 00:44:51,839
She is a liar

1031
00:44:52,095 --> 00:44:53,119
Same

1032
00:44:53,375 --> 00:44:56,447
So that the issue that I come to the kids very

1033
00:44:57,727 --> 00:44:59,007
Differences between

1034
00:44:59,263 --> 00:45:00,031
Providing

1035
00:45:00,287 --> 00:45:03,103
Reproductive Rights even up to late-term

1036
00:45:03,615 --> 00:45:04,895
It in

1037
00:45:05,407 --> 00:45:06,175
Particularly where

1038
00:45:06,431 --> 00:45:06,943
A person's life

1039
00:45:07,199 --> 00:45:11,295
At risk or the the child would be on viable outside the womb

1040
00:45:11,551 --> 00:45:14,879
Those sorts of things are very different than someone murdering a pregnant

1041
00:45:15,647 --> 00:45:17,439
Thursday Elemento

1042
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:19,231
The rights

1043
00:45:19,487 --> 00:45:21,279
Being violated by a murder

1044
00:45:21,535 --> 00:45:24,607
I bet y'all are not there in the conversation of

1045
00:45:25,375 --> 00:45:26,399
You going to let's say

1046
00:45:27,167 --> 00:45:32,287
Electively ending a pregnancy even if it is in the 9th month when if you give birth

1047
00:45:32,543 --> 00:45:33,311
The child doodle

1048
00:45:33,823 --> 00:45:35,871
Leave for a couple hours and die of

1049
00:45:36,127 --> 00:45:36,639
Painful death

1050
00:45:36,895 --> 00:45:37,407
No one's

1051
00:45:37,663 --> 00:45:38,943
No one is providing

1052
00:45:39,199 --> 00:45:39,711
9th

1053
00:45:39,967 --> 00:45:41,503
Month abortion for someone who's like

1054
00:45:41,759 --> 00:45:44,063
So it's going to be a boy I wanted a girl

1055
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:46,111
That is that doesn't happen that is

1056
00:45:46,367 --> 00:45:47,647
Fake talking point

1057
00:45:47,903 --> 00:45:48,671
That she's putting forth here

1058
00:45:49,183 --> 00:45:50,719
But the big lie

1059
00:45:50,975 --> 00:45:52,255
Is the two countries

1060
00:45:53,535 --> 00:45:56,607
There are seven countries in the world that allow elective abortion

1061
00:45:57,119 --> 00:45:58,655
You just choose

1062
00:45:58,911 --> 00:46:00,191
Who get an abortion

1063
00:46:00,703 --> 00:46:02,239
Improper

1064
00:46:03,007 --> 00:46:04,031
After 20 weeks

1065
00:46:04,543 --> 00:46:09,151
And they are canada-china the Netherlands North Korea Singapore the United States

1066
00:46:09,407 --> 00:46:10,175
And Vietnam

1067
00:46:10,687 --> 00:46:14,783
She just chose to say China and North Korea because those are the two big Boogeyman

1068
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:19,903
The anti-communist extreme right-wing circles which Jim Bakker is a religious offshoot of

1069
00:46:20,415 --> 00:46:23,487
So it's definitely not in their interest to muddy the conversation by bringing

1070
00:46:23,743 --> 00:46:25,535
Canada in the Netherlands into the conversation

1071
00:46:26,047 --> 00:46:26,815
No no no

1072
00:46:27,583 --> 00:46:28,351
It's much easier

1073
00:46:28,863 --> 00:46:31,935
To just pretend that the only people who would allow this thing that you're again

1074
00:46:32,447 --> 00:46:35,263
Are in these countries you've already established his code words

1075
00:46:36,031 --> 00:46:36,799
That's b*******

1076
00:46:37,055 --> 00:46:37,823
Well just listen to

1077
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:38,591
Their reaction.

1078
00:46:40,383 --> 00:46:41,663
Those two countries

1079
00:46:41,919 --> 00:46:43,967
We're like that there is nothing

1080
00:46:44,223 --> 00:46:44,991
I

1081
00:46:45,247 --> 00:46:46,015
Appreciate more

1082
00:46:47,551 --> 00:46:48,063
Somebody

1083
00:46:48,319 --> 00:46:48,831
Who goes on

1084
00:46:50,879 --> 00:46:51,391
James the word of

1085
00:46:53,439 --> 00:46:54,207
Insta lie directly to

1086
00:46:55,231 --> 00:46:55,743
Over and out

1087
00:46:56,767 --> 00:46:57,791
Bright there is nothing

1088
00:46:58,047 --> 00:46:59,071
More in keeping

1089
00:46:59,327 --> 00:47:00,351
With the teachings

1090
00:47:00,607 --> 00:47:02,399
Christ Dan Rochelle

1091
00:47:03,167 --> 00:47:06,495
So I do know Alex believe that were fighting with actual demons

1092
00:47:06,751 --> 00:47:08,287
Principalities

1093
00:47:08,799 --> 00:47:09,823
So does

1094
00:47:10,335 --> 00:47:11,871
All white game

1095
00:47:12,127 --> 00:47:13,151
So now you're looking

1096
00:47:13,407 --> 00:47:14,175
Thanks 4 minutes

1097
00:47:14,431 --> 00:47:15,199
Spiritually

1098
00:47:15,455 --> 00:47:16,479
Wrestling against flesh

1099
00:47:16,735 --> 00:47:19,807
Can blood and I know I'll get a lot of backlash that's okay bring it on

1100
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:22,111
Alright Ephesians 6:12

1101
00:47:22,367 --> 00:47:23,391
Says we are wrestling against

1102
00:47:23,647 --> 00:47:24,415
Principalities

1103
00:47:24,927 --> 00:47:25,695
Wickedness

1104
00:47:26,975 --> 00:47:27,999
Principalities power

1105
00:47:28,255 --> 00:47:29,791
Darkness and wickedness

1106
00:47:30,047 --> 00:47:32,095
There are strong men that we know there's a

1107
00:47:32,351 --> 00:47:33,119
The Jezebel spirit

1108
00:47:33,887 --> 00:47:38,751
We know that's operating there's a leviathan Spirit we know that top-right and get here by Bon just understand

1109
00:47:39,007 --> 00:47:39,519
Behemoth

1110
00:47:39,775 --> 00:47:40,287
Bilal

1111
00:47:40,543 --> 00:47:41,055
Abaddon

1112
00:47:41,311 --> 00:47:43,615
The Bible tells you what the principalities are

1113
00:47:43,871 --> 00:47:46,431
The Bible declares with the strong men are

1114
00:47:46,687 --> 00:47:52,831
We can do it but if we don't go in and war against it as one again Believers that have authority

1115
00:47:53,087 --> 00:47:54,879
Heaven and in Earth

1116
00:47:55,135 --> 00:48:00,511
That we have power through the blood of Jesus Christ is not a natural battle it's a spiritual battle

1117
00:48:00,767 --> 00:48:04,607
And when you look at the only other two that do late-term that is murder

1118
00:48:04,863 --> 00:48:11,007
I'm just dealing with one issue I'm not even telling you all the good things for doing the religious

1119
00:48:11,775 --> 00:48:15,103
Lower Court Supreme Court

1120
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:20,479
You are so gross

1121
00:48:20,735 --> 00:48:21,247
That is

1122
00:48:21,503 --> 00:48:22,783
Discuss

1123
00:48:24,063 --> 00:48:27,647
Damn damn damn

1124
00:48:27,903 --> 00:48:32,511
Spiritual victories are he has appointed justices that's what she's got

1125
00:48:32,767 --> 00:48:35,583
For medical this is a religion

1126
00:48:36,095 --> 00:48:37,631
Completely

1127
00:48:37,887 --> 00:48:38,655
Separate political

1128
00:48:41,215 --> 00:48:42,239
Appointing a lot of

1129
00:48:42,495 --> 00:48:44,799
Justices to the Dodgers judgeship

1130
00:48:45,055 --> 00:48:46,591
Yeah I mean that's really

1131
00:48:47,103 --> 00:48:47,871
No no

1132
00:48:48,383 --> 00:48:54,015
Religiously appointment maybe the point that she wants to

1133
00:48:54,271 --> 00:48:54,783
To make

1134
00:48:55,039 --> 00:48:56,319
But won't make

1135
00:48:56,831 --> 00:48:59,647
Is the part of her religious belief is

1136
00:48:59,903 --> 00:49:00,415
Political

1137
00:49:00,671 --> 00:49:03,231
Maybe part of the the the thing that

1138
00:49:03,743 --> 00:49:04,767
Trying to express

1139
00:49:05,279 --> 00:49:06,303
But won't

1140
00:49:06,815 --> 00:49:07,583
Probably

1141
00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:09,119
Well what were you then

1142
00:49:09,375 --> 00:49:11,679
Is that there is a political dynamic

1143
00:49:12,191 --> 00:49:12,959
And advocacy

1144
00:49:13,471 --> 00:49:15,007
And in action

1145
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:18,079
That implied in her application

1146
00:49:18,335 --> 00:49:18,847
Jennifer religious

1147
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:20,127
Are you trying to get rid of it

1148
00:49:21,151 --> 00:49:24,479
I don't know she has it honestly

1149
00:49:25,503 --> 00:49:28,063
I don't know I've never I never look into those sorts

1150
00:49:28,831 --> 00:49:31,903
Because I think a lot of people just sacrifice their 501c

1151
00:49:32,159 --> 00:49:34,719
C3 status in order to act like your Baker does

1152
00:49:34,975 --> 00:49:38,047
I think I think that some folks

1153
00:49:38,303 --> 00:49:44,191
Like fuk it we're going we're going to go too far we're going to get in trouble let's just

1154
00:49:44,447 --> 00:49:46,239
I've already been to prison once

1155
00:49:46,495 --> 00:49:48,799
I don't I don't know if it's a little bit of a mystery

1156
00:49:49,055 --> 00:49:51,103
I would be I would be surprised if you

1157
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:52,127
He pays much until

1158
00:49:52,383 --> 00:49:54,943
But I also wouldn't be surprised too much of

1159
00:49:55,199 --> 00:49:55,967
You just said

1160
00:49:56,479 --> 00:49:56,991
It's not worth it

1161
00:49:58,271 --> 00:49:59,551
I find that

1162
00:49:59,807 --> 00:50:00,831
They are

1163
00:50:01,087 --> 00:50:02,623
Cuz that's one of the things that they're going to

1164
00:50:03,647 --> 00:50:04,159
What is the fact that he

1165
00:50:04,415 --> 00:50:05,183
He is appointed

1166
00:50:06,207 --> 00:50:06,975
They're not going to camp

1167
00:50:07,999 --> 00:50:08,511
Doing anything

1168
00:50:08,767 --> 00:50:09,535
Cuz he hasn't smoke point

1169
00:50:10,047 --> 00:50:10,559
Are they just

1170
00:50:14,143 --> 00:50:19,519
I don't actually know but I don't know where's it at

1171
00:50:21,055 --> 00:50:21,823
Greater

1172
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:26,175
Sorry I didn't

1173
00:50:26,431 --> 00:50:29,759
Get to the bottom of this alright stop episode

1174
00:50:30,015 --> 00:50:31,039
It's just so

1175
00:50:31,295 --> 00:50:32,575
Nakedly hypocritical

1176
00:50:33,087 --> 00:50:34,111
That idea of

1177
00:50:34,367 --> 00:50:35,647
Here's what we are proud of

1178
00:50:36,159 --> 00:50:37,183
We're proud of him

1179
00:50:37,695 --> 00:50:38,975
Appointing judges

1180
00:50:39,487 --> 00:50:42,047
Who are going to brazenly rewrite the law

1181
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:45,119
Fit our religious Zack bialigy

1182
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:48,703
You cannot if if you are campaigning on a pointing

1183
00:50:49,983 --> 00:50:51,775
What you are really saying is

1184
00:50:52,031 --> 00:50:54,335
I am destroying doctor democracy

1185
00:50:54,847 --> 00:50:55,871
Through the courts

1186
00:50:56,127 --> 00:50:58,687
One of the things that's so

1187
00:50:58,943 --> 00:50:59,967
Hypocritical in

1188
00:51:00,223 --> 00:51:02,527
And gross about this too is one of the things that

1189
00:51:03,295 --> 00:51:04,319
Commonly in these right way

1190
00:51:04,575 --> 00:51:05,087
Doing circles

1191
00:51:05,343 --> 00:51:09,951
As an attack on Islam is to say it's not a religion it's a political ideology

1192
00:51:10,463 --> 00:51:14,303
The political system mask deza is a religion

1193
00:51:14,815 --> 00:51:15,839
And I don't believe that

1194
00:51:16,095 --> 00:51:17,375
To be true I don't think that that is a

1195
00:51:17,631 --> 00:51:18,143
The fair attack

1196
00:51:18,399 --> 00:51:19,423
Back on Islam

1197
00:51:20,447 --> 00:51:24,287
And I don't think it's a fair thing to say about Christianity either

1198
00:51:24,799 --> 00:51:25,823
But I do think

1199
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:27,871
Is it the way that Paula is engaging

1200
00:51:28,127 --> 00:51:29,151
With some Christianity

1201
00:51:29,663 --> 00:51:31,711
Lends itself to be also

1202
00:51:32,223 --> 00:51:34,015
A political

1203
00:51:34,527 --> 00:51:37,087
So when when you have these people who are attacking

1204
00:51:37,343 --> 00:51:39,391
King Islam with these

1205
00:51:39,647 --> 00:51:40,159
Pacific

1206
00:51:41,183 --> 00:51:41,695
Attacks

1207
00:51:41,951 --> 00:51:45,279
And are acting in ways that are similar to the

1208
00:51:45,535 --> 00:51:47,583
Depiction of Islam that there

1209
00:51:47,839 --> 00:51:48,863
Putting forth

1210
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:49,631
It just

1211
00:51:50,399 --> 00:51:50,911
It's very tough

1212
00:51:51,423 --> 00:51:52,959
It's very it's very tough to swallow

1213
00:51:53,471 --> 00:51:53,983
It is

1214
00:51:54,239 --> 00:51:56,287
It's just it's the religious version of

1215
00:51:56,543 --> 00:51:57,311
So much

1216
00:51:57,567 --> 00:51:58,079
Up like

1217
00:51:58,335 --> 00:52:01,151
I know exactly how we're going to Moline my opponent

1218
00:52:01,663 --> 00:52:03,711
We're going to say they're doing what we're doing

1219
00:52:04,223 --> 00:52:08,063
And then no one will know incredibly effective

1220
00:52:08,575 --> 00:52:09,855
Such a universe

1221
00:52:10,367 --> 00:52:10,879
Application

1222
00:52:11,647 --> 00:52:12,159
So

1223
00:52:12,415 --> 00:52:14,207
Most of the beginning of this episode

1224
00:52:14,463 --> 00:52:15,743
What is selling policy

1225
00:52:16,511 --> 00:52:17,535
Trying to move this book

1226
00:52:17,791 --> 00:52:20,351
It changed Lori's life although Jim won't let her talk about it

1227
00:52:22,655 --> 00:52:24,703
I think that might have been the way that it

1228
00:52:25,727 --> 00:52:27,775
GIF it's no longer allowing her to

1229
00:52:28,031 --> 00:52:29,055
To talk so

1230
00:52:29,311 --> 00:52:35,455
The middle part in I get a little bit of trump is great I'm not in politics but here's all this political s***

1231
00:52:37,247 --> 00:52:37,759
Then

1232
00:52:38,527 --> 00:52:39,039
Towards the end

1233
00:52:39,807 --> 00:52:40,319
Begets

1234
00:52:40,831 --> 00:52:41,343
Big

1235
00:52:41,855 --> 00:52:42,367
News

1236
00:52:42,879 --> 00:52:44,415
God has spoken to me in the last

1237
00:52:44,671 --> 00:52:45,439
Last 24 hours

1238
00:52:45,695 --> 00:52:47,487
It was it's time to Launch

1239
00:52:47,999 --> 00:52:48,767
My final

And

1242

00:53:03,871 --> 00:53:04,383
It's fine

1246
00:53:04,639 --> 00:53:06,431
Give me strength to keep going

1247
00:53:07,455 --> 00:53:07,967
If you can keep

1248
00:53:08,223 --> 00:53:08,735

Amen

1251
00:53:12,575 --> 00:53:13,343
So today

1252
00:53:14,367 --> 00:53:16,415
On this broadcast I'm introducing

1253
00:53:16,671 --> 00:53:17,183
What God is

1254
00:53:17,439 --> 00:53:19,231
Please bring it to me next and by the way I'm

1255
00:53:19,487 --> 00:53:20,255
New Year's Eve

1256
00:53:20,767 --> 00:53:21,279
I want you to

1257
00:53:21,535 --> 00:53:22,303
Listen to me

1258
00:53:22,559 --> 00:53:23,583
A New Year's Eve

1259
00:53:24,607 --> 00:53:26,399
God woke me in the night last night

1260
00:53:27,167 --> 00:53:29,727
About this program a New Year's events going on

1261
00:53:29,983 --> 00:53:32,031
God gave me

1262
00:53:33,055 --> 00:53:34,591
A full download

1263
00:53:35,871 --> 00:53:37,407
At what is going to happen next

1264
00:53:37,919 --> 00:53:38,943
Oh God

1265
00:53:39,199 --> 00:53:42,271
It's so shocking I'm not going to tell you now I won't tell you this week

1266
00:53:43,551 --> 00:53:44,319
God willing

1267
00:53:44,575 --> 00:53:45,343
New Year's Eve

1268
00:53:46,623 --> 00:53:48,415
Will be my first major New Year's Eve

1269
00:53:48,671 --> 00:53:49,183
The dress

1270
00:53:49,439 --> 00:53:50,463
So he's

1271
00:53:50,719 --> 00:53:51,999
What is happening

1272
00:53:52,255 --> 00:53:55,071
God revealed something to him back in New Year's Eve

1273
00:53:56,351 --> 00:53:59,167
And then our next New Year's Eve

1274
00:53:59,423 --> 00:54:02,239
Gotcha

1275
00:54:02,495 --> 00:54:04,287
This can't be a very important prophecy

1276
00:54:04,543 --> 00:54:07,871
If you can wait a year

1277
00:54:08,127 --> 00:54:10,687
Well the fun thing about these text property

1278
00:54:11,199 --> 00:54:13,759
Is that he's going to announce something that happened into

1279
00:54:14,015 --> 00:54:18,111
December on New Year's Eve about what happened in

1280
00:54:18,879 --> 00:54:22,463
Convoluted nonsensical

1281
00:54:23,487 --> 00:54:25,023
But easy said that

1282
00:54:25,279 --> 00:54:27,071
New Year's Eve Suites week for religion

1283
00:54:27,839 --> 00:54:29,119
I'm thinking that you just

1284
00:54:29,375 --> 00:54:33,983
Mixed up that New Year's Eve prophecy and whatever God told him within the last

1285
00:54:34,239 --> 00:54:36,031
Well yeah because in the last week

1286
00:54:36,287 --> 00:54:36,799
I told him

1287
00:54:37,055 --> 00:54:37,567
To form his

1288
00:54:38,079 --> 00:54:38,847
Last Network

1289
00:54:39,103 --> 00:54:39,871
I don't know what that is

1290
00:54:40,127 --> 00:54:41,663
My will learn a little bit more

1291
00:54:42,175 --> 00:54:42,687
God

1292
00:54:42,943 --> 00:54:43,967
Spoke to me

1293
00:54:44,735 --> 00:54:46,015
That we were two

1294
00:54:46,271 --> 00:54:48,319
To finish this studio ever Studio

1295
00:54:49,087 --> 00:54:51,135
Under construction for the last couple years

1296
00:54:51,391 --> 00:54:52,159
There's the building

1297
00:54:53,695 --> 00:54:54,975
And inside that building

1298
00:54:55,231 --> 00:54:56,255
Has no

1299
00:54:56,511 --> 00:54:57,279
Equipment in it yet

1300
00:54:57,535 --> 00:54:59,071
It needs the walls and everything

1301
00:54:59,327 --> 00:55:00,095
Debate put in

1302
00:55:00,351 --> 00:55:00,863
All the

1303
00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:01,631
Lighting fixture

1304
00:55:03,167 --> 00:55:05,215
It could be done in 90 days

1305
00:55:05,471 --> 00:55:05,983
If I had the money

1306
00:55:07,775 --> 00:55:10,591
And it's getting so difficult to raise money because

1307
00:55:11,103 --> 00:55:11,615
Little people

1308
00:55:11,871 --> 00:55:13,151
You shouldn't do this you shouldn't

1309
00:55:13,407 --> 00:55:13,919
Sell items

1310
00:55:14,175 --> 00:55:14,943
You shouldn't do this thing

1311
00:55:15,199 --> 00:55:15,711
You know what

1312
00:55:15,967 --> 00:55:17,759
If you got a good idea that works out

1313
00:55:18,015 --> 00:55:18,527
I'll take

1314
00:55:19,295 --> 00:55:20,575
Exactly

1315
00:55:22,111 --> 00:55:23,391
The ridiculousness

1316
00:55:23,647 --> 00:55:24,927
So that is like okay

1317
00:55:25,183 --> 00:55:25,951
You going to go to work and work

1318
00:55:26,207 --> 00:55:26,719
For free

1319
00:55:26,975 --> 00:55:27,743
I mean Sears

1320
00:55:28,255 --> 00:55:34,399
Oh wow wow Paula

1321
00:55:35,679 --> 00:55:36,191
Boy

1322
00:55:39,775 --> 00:55:41,567
But follow in the footsteps

1323
00:55:41,823 --> 00:55:44,383
Jesus Christ

1324
00:55:44,639 --> 00:55:50,783
But I'm not doing it for free baby Jesus you better fucken give me benefits to I want good in

1325
00:55:51,295 --> 00:55:51,807
Jesus

1326
00:55:52,575 --> 00:55:54,623
Are they building a new studio

1327
00:55:55,135 --> 00:55:58,207
Yeah and he's pretty self-conscious about raising money because

1328
00:55:58,719 --> 00:56:00,511
Now people are making fun of the buckets

1329
00:56:00,767 --> 00:56:02,815
And all that is rightfully pointed out he's an evil being

1330
00:56:03,071 --> 00:56:08,191
Yeah might have flown under the radar for a while and then people started

1331
00:56:08,447 --> 00:56:10,751
No posting little clips of

1332
00:56:11,263 --> 00:56:13,567
Him doing this absurd bucket

1333
00:56:13,823 --> 00:56:14,847
Twitter is out

1334
00:56:15,103 --> 00:56:16,127
Look bad

1335
00:56:16,639 --> 00:56:18,175
Stop him

1336
00:56:18,431 --> 00:56:20,223
No I mean hey

1337
00:56:20,479 --> 00:56:20,991
Zoe's

1338
00:56:21,247 --> 00:56:21,759
These starting the

1339
00:56:22,271 --> 00:56:24,063
You need to build build his new studio

1340
00:56:24,319 --> 00:56:26,111
Because he's starting a network called

1341
00:56:26,367 --> 00:56:27,391
The voice of the prophet

1342
00:56:28,671 --> 00:56:32,511
He wants to run 24 hours a day very reminiscent of Alex

1343
00:56:32,767 --> 00:56:34,303
I do know everybody wants

1344
00:56:36,095 --> 00:56:37,375
These people don't

1345
00:56:37,631 --> 00:56:38,143
Nye's

1346
00:56:38,399 --> 00:56:41,471
That one of the things that's the biggest problem with the media

1347
00:56:41,727 --> 00:56:42,239
You nowadays

1348
00:56:42,495 --> 00:56:44,287
Is the 24-hour cycle

1349
00:56:44,543 --> 00:56:50,687
They don't realize that they will fall victim to the same thing

1350
00:56:50,943 --> 00:56:51,711
Be the worst thing possible

1351
00:56:51,967 --> 00:56:55,807
No voice of the prophets 24-hour

1352
00:56:56,063 --> 00:56:58,111
Add a prophecy Network

1353
00:56:58,367 --> 00:57:01,183
Be it be ridiculous if he sucks diminishing returns

1354
00:57:01,439 --> 00:57:02,463
Davida's Astros idea

1355
00:57:02,975 --> 00:57:03,487
But

1356
00:57:03,999 --> 00:57:04,767
You need to do this

1357
00:57:05,279 --> 00:57:05,791
Because

1358
00:57:06,047 --> 00:57:06,815
Prophets of things

1359
00:57:07,071 --> 00:57:09,631
To say sometimes they might want to say something at 3 in the morning

1360
00:57:10,143 --> 00:57:12,191
All right I mean that's a good argument

1361
00:57:12,447 --> 00:57:16,543
So anyway you needs you to give him a bunch of mice

1362
00:57:17,823 --> 00:57:18,591
The voice of the

1363
00:57:18,847 --> 00:57:19,359
The prophets

1364
00:57:19,615 --> 00:57:20,127
Network

1365
00:57:20,639 --> 00:57:23,455
Prison God spoke to me to build a network

1366
00:57:24,479 --> 00:57:26,271
And put his last night

1367
00:57:27,295 --> 00:57:29,087
Bugatti spoken to me to go

1368
00:57:30,623 --> 00:57:31,391
Major televised

1369
00:57:32,159 --> 00:57:32,671
Amen

1370
00:57:33,439 --> 00:57:34,719
Twenty-four hours a day

1371
00:57:34,975 --> 00:57:35,999
Where God moves

1372
00:57:36,511 --> 00:57:37,279
What are the prophets

1373
00:57:37,535 --> 00:57:38,047
Said

1374
00:57:38,815 --> 00:57:39,327
Jim

1375
00:57:39,583 --> 00:57:40,863
Is going to broadcast

1376
00:57:41,631 --> 00:57:42,911
The events of what gods

1377
00:57:44,959 --> 00:57:47,007
Healings and miracles take

1378
00:57:47,263 --> 00:57:48,543
Place up here on this phone

1379
00:57:49,055 --> 00:57:50,591
Add so where to go to

1380
00:57:51,359 --> 00:57:53,407
And we had we can do this we can do it in 90 days

1381
00:57:53,663 --> 00:57:55,199
We could be on there 24 hours

1382
00:57:55,455 --> 00:57:55,967
Richard day

1383
00:57:56,735 --> 00:57:57,247
Beaming

1384
00:57:58,783 --> 00:58:00,063
Loudly

1385
00:58:00,831 --> 00:58:02,367
That's our PTO means profit

1386
00:58:02,879 --> 00:58:03,647
Talking loudly

1387
00:58:04,415 --> 00:58:06,975
And so what the studio is there that's the

1388
00:58:07,231 --> 00:58:07,999
I renamed

1389
00:58:08,255 --> 00:58:09,535
The studio the voice of the prophet

1390
00:58:09,791 --> 00:58:10,303
Studio

1391
00:58:10,559 --> 00:58:11,071
And

1392
00:58:12,095 --> 00:58:13,119
In the

1393
00:58:13,631 --> 00:58:14,655
Entrance

1394
00:58:15,167 --> 00:58:15,679
The lobby

1395
00:58:16,191 --> 00:58:17,471
I called The Atrium

1396
00:58:18,239 --> 00:58:19,007
Event Studio

1397
00:58:21,311 --> 00:58:22,335
I have a

1398
00:58:22,591 --> 00:58:23,103
Picture

1399
00:58:23,871 --> 00:58:24,895
But my dream of it

1400
00:58:25,151 --> 00:58:26,431
This is the lobby

1401
00:58:26,943 --> 00:58:28,479
The Hall of the prophets

1402
00:58:28,735 --> 00:58:29,247
Atrium

1403
00:58:30,015 --> 00:58:32,831
And Jesus God willing is going to move

1404
00:58:33,599 --> 00:58:34,111
There

1405
00:58:34,623 --> 00:58:35,135
From here

1406
00:58:36,159 --> 00:58:38,207
Because this is the Hall of the prophets

1407
00:58:38,975 --> 00:58:41,023
And it's going to it's going to have a

1408
00:58:41,279 --> 00:58:41,791
Yep

1409
00:58:42,303 --> 00:58:43,583
A place we're going to put glass

1410
00:58:43,839 --> 00:58:45,631
Ibrance played on those who give this

1411
00:58:45,887 --> 00:58:46,911
$1,000

1412
00:58:47,167 --> 00:58:47,679
The gift

1413
00:58:48,959 --> 00:58:49,471
DeVille

1414
00:58:49,727 --> 00:58:50,239
Infinity

1415
00:58:51,519 --> 00:58:52,287
Open the network

1416
00:58:52,543 --> 00:58:53,567
Twenty-four hours a day

1417
00:58:54,591 --> 00:58:55,871
An openness Studio

1418
00:58:57,151 --> 00:58:58,431
So they can broadcast

1419
00:58:58,687 --> 00:58:59,455
Twenty-four hours a day

1420
00:58:59,711 --> 00:59:02,527
So you give $1,000 you get a plaque in the hallway

1421
00:59:02,783 --> 00:59:08,927
Is he forcibly relocating Jesus it does seem like that against the law

1422
00:59:09,439 --> 00:59:12,767
Jesus is everywhere and within all of us

1423
00:59:13,279 --> 00:59:18,143
He's evicting Jesus from the Morningside

1424
00:59:20,447 --> 00:59:21,215
Stevens with vinegar

1425
00:59:21,471 --> 00:59:25,567
Rent control Dan and then he's big developers come in trying to

1426
00:59:25,823 --> 00:59:27,103
Donate money to build his

1427
00:59:27,615 --> 00:59:30,175
I don't see a fundamental reason why he came

1428
00:59:30,687 --> 00:59:31,711
Just do what he's doing

1429
00:59:31,967 --> 00:59:32,735
Now like

1430
00:59:33,247 --> 00:59:34,527
On some sort of the streaming

1431
00:59:35,039 --> 00:59:35,551
Service

1432
00:59:35,807 --> 00:59:37,343
Like any kind of

1433
00:59:37,599 --> 00:59:39,903
Ikea's website has streaming capability

1434
00:59:40,159 --> 00:59:41,183
Like you could just

1435
00:59:41,439 --> 00:59:41,951
Get on

1436
00:59:43,231 --> 00:59:47,071
4

1437
00:59:47,583 --> 00:59:49,375
Nile overhead

1438
00:59:49,887 --> 00:59:51,167
He has a studio

1439
00:59:52,959 --> 00:59:55,007
He's filming this very episode in

1440
00:59:55,519 --> 00:59:56,543
I think one of the reasons

1441
00:59:57,055 --> 00:59:58,847
Can't do that 24 hours there

1442
00:59:59,103 --> 01:00:02,943
It's because this isn't his studio is state is in

1443
01:00:03,455 --> 01:00:04,991
Ballroom

1444
01:00:05,247 --> 01:00:07,039
Yeah yeah yeah but a long

1445
01:00:07,551 --> 01:00:08,319
DeWalt

1446
01:00:09,599 --> 01:00:10,623
This compound

1447
01:00:10,879 --> 01:00:11,903
Involves

1448
01:00:13,183 --> 01:00:14,207
Living quarters

1449
01:00:14,463 --> 01:00:15,743
Federal write-off

1450
01:00:15,999 --> 01:00:22,143
24/7 then people are going to be like turn it down out there

1451
01:00:22,399 --> 01:00:23,679
I think so

1452
01:00:23,935 --> 01:00:24,703
Icepeak

1453
01:00:24,959 --> 01:00:31,103
I think that's the fundamental problem I think that makes it so he needs to move the the shooting space

1454
01:00:31,359 --> 01:00:32,383
Right from that

1455
01:00:32,639 --> 01:00:33,407
I think

1456
01:00:33,663 --> 01:00:34,431
Ridiculous

1457
01:00:34,687 --> 01:00:35,455
F****** Transit

1458
01:00:35,711 --> 01:00:36,735
Parrot

1459
01:00:36,991 --> 01:00:38,271
Bulshit

1460
01:00:38,783 --> 01:00:39,295
80s

1461
01:00:39,551 --> 01:00:40,063
It is

1462
01:00:40,575 --> 01:00:41,855
Amazing

1463
01:00:42,111 --> 01:00:43,903
Amazing to me that you could litter

1464
01:00:44,159 --> 01:00:45,183
It's not Lisa

1465
01:00:45,439 --> 01:00:45,951
Because it's like

1466
01:00:46,719 --> 01:00:49,279
Purely Megalodon megalomaniacal

1467
01:00:49,535 --> 01:00:51,327
Like it is not it is not practical

1468
01:00:51,839 --> 01:00:53,119
It is not a way to make any

1469
01:00:53,631 --> 01:00:56,447
It is it is a it is building it

1470
01:00:56,703 --> 01:00:57,471
Asia mandamus

1471
01:00:57,727 --> 01:01:00,543
It is building statues of f****** Xerxes

1472
01:01:00,799 --> 01:01:02,079
So that when he dies

1473
01:01:02,335 --> 01:01:03,615
He has something to leave behind

1474
01:01:03,871 --> 01:01:09,247
I think that's part of it but I also think that the people like Jim Bakker in this scam

1475
01:01:09,503 --> 01:01:10,271
Any kind of community

1476
01:01:11,039 --> 01:01:13,343
They probably see all signs being green lights

1477
01:01:13,855 --> 01:01:15,135
You have gas you have Trump

1478
01:01:15,391 --> 01:01:16,927
Indicating that he's not going

1479
01:01:17,183 --> 01:01:18,207
Into an anyway

1480
01:01:18,463 --> 01:01:19,231
Encourage

1481
01:01:19,743 --> 01:01:22,047
Enforcement of the Johnson Amendment

1482
01:01:22,303 --> 01:01:22,815
Shinzon Church

1483
01:01:23,071 --> 01:01:24,351
Behavior

1484
01:01:24,863 --> 01:01:26,655
You have him putting Paula white-cain

1485
01:01:26,911 --> 01:01:28,959
Pain into an official position in the White House

1486
01:01:29,471 --> 01:01:30,495
You've got to think like

1487
01:01:30,751 --> 01:01:33,055
Now is the time we got to strike while the iron

1488
01:01:33,311 --> 01:01:34,847
Hot we got to do whatever we can

1489
01:01:35,359 --> 01:01:36,127
Expand this Griff

1490
01:01:36,895 --> 01:01:37,663
Amion

1491
01:01:37,919 --> 01:01:39,199
I get why you do that

1492
01:01:39,455 --> 01:01:40,479
That but it also

1493
01:01:40,991 --> 01:01:41,759
Woefully Tran

1494
01:01:42,271 --> 01:01:43,551
This is just like

1495
01:01:43,807 --> 01:01:44,831
All right we got to do this

1496
01:01:45,087 --> 01:01:45,599
We hacked

1497
01:01:45,855 --> 01:01:47,135
Have to get going on this year

1498
01:01:47,391 --> 01:01:49,439
We can make millions and millions of dollars

1499
01:01:49,695 --> 01:01:50,719
If we can just

1500
01:01:51,487 --> 01:01:53,023
Point we need to get to buy

1501
01:01:53,279 --> 01:01:54,559
That Windows going to be closed

1502
01:01:55,327 --> 01:01:57,631
Eventually I'm Amazed

1503
01:01:57,887 --> 01:01:58,399
How come from

1504
01:01:59,167 --> 01:01:59,679
Well I think

1505
01:01:59,935 --> 01:02:00,447
Terrifying

1506
01:02:01,471 --> 01:02:02,495
As if they're that

1507
01:02:03,007 --> 01:02:05,567
Well until the election

1508
01:02:05,823 --> 01:02:06,591
Right right

1509
01:02:06,847 --> 01:02:07,359
Right

1510
01:02:07,615 --> 01:02:08,639
Trump wins

1511
01:02:09,151 --> 01:02:13,759
In 2020 they have a real nice cushion

1512
01:02:14,015 --> 01:02:16,063
We're going to run rampant

1513
01:02:16,319 --> 01:02:20,927
2020 doesn't go their way they still have a year where I am

1514
01:02:21,439 --> 01:02:21,951
We can make

1515
01:02:22,207 --> 01:02:24,767
We can make a move here

1516
01:02:25,023 --> 01:02:26,815
Eminem challenges

1517
01:02:27,327 --> 01:02:28,351
People who commented

1518
01:02:28,607 --> 01:02:29,631
After Trump to

1519
01:02:30,143 --> 01:02:30,655
Tamp down

1520
01:02:32,447 --> 01:02:33,983
Explain political capital in order to

1521
01:02:34,239 --> 01:02:35,007
Undo

1522
01:02:35,263 --> 01:02:36,543
Whatever

1523
01:02:36,799 --> 01:02:37,311
Monstrosity

1524
01:02:37,823 --> 01:02:41,919
Rope horrific monstrosity is fair but I haven't seen him go but

1525
01:02:42,687 --> 01:02:44,991
I only saw an artist rendering of it

1526
01:02:45,247 --> 01:02:46,271
And it looks just like a

1527
01:02:46,783 --> 01:02:49,599
I don't know I wouldn't be surprised if it looked like Jim Bakker

1528
01:02:50,367 --> 01:02:52,159
Like that's that's the level of

1529
01:02:52,415 --> 01:02:53,183
Narcissus

1530
01:02:53,695 --> 01:02:54,207
Castleware deal

1531
01:02:54,719 --> 01:02:55,231
Yeah

1532
01:02:55,487 --> 01:02:57,279
So in the next clip

1533
01:02:57,535 --> 01:03:01,375
Jim kind of rewrites his own legal troubles

1534
01:03:01,631 --> 01:03:02,911
From the 80s

1535
01:03:03,679 --> 01:03:04,703
People do not

1536
01:03:04,959 --> 01:03:05,471
Stan

1537
01:03:06,239 --> 01:03:07,519
But I have talked to people

1538
01:03:07,775 --> 01:03:08,287
Boonton government

1539
01:03:09,567 --> 01:03:10,591
In prison and out

1540
01:03:11,871 --> 01:03:12,639
Believe me it's a lot of

1541
01:03:17,247 --> 01:03:18,271
They were afraid that I

1542
01:03:18,527 --> 01:03:19,807
I was going to endorse Pat Robert

1543
01:03:20,319 --> 01:03:20,831
For president

1544
01:03:22,111 --> 01:03:24,159
And they thought with his audience in my arm

1545
01:03:24,671 --> 01:03:25,695
They had no chance

1546
01:03:26,463 --> 01:03:26,975
Against

1547
01:03:27,231 --> 01:03:27,743
Pat Roberts

1548
01:03:28,255 --> 01:03:29,023
And he won the first

1549
01:03:29,279 --> 01:03:30,047
Yep primary

1550
01:03:32,095 --> 01:03:33,119
So they thought

1551
01:03:33,375 --> 01:03:34,143
Talk about

1552
01:03:39,519 --> 01:03:40,031
The

1553
01:03:40,287 --> 01:03:41,567
The president who

1554
01:03:43,359 --> 01:03:44,383
Ronald Reagan

1555
01:03:45,407 --> 01:03:46,431
I mentioned to him

1556
01:03:46,943 --> 01:03:48,479
I said I'm going to do everything

1557
01:03:48,735 --> 01:03:50,015
We thought the Carolina Broad

1558
01:03:50,527 --> 01:03:53,087
Everything to deliver 50 million votes

1559
01:03:53,599 --> 01:03:56,671
Political

1560
01:03:57,695 --> 01:03:58,207
Avenger

1561
01:03:58,719 --> 01:03:59,999
Brought into his home.

1562
01:04:00,255 --> 01:04:01,279
And we helped

1563
01:04:01,535 --> 01:04:02,047
When

1564
01:04:02,815 --> 01:04:03,327
That present

1565
01:04:04,095 --> 01:04:04,863
Tooth presents

1566
01:04:06,143 --> 01:04:08,447
Political about that

1567
01:04:08,703 --> 01:04:10,495
Temperatures along about understand

1568
01:04:10,751 --> 01:04:11,263
All these prints

1569
01:04:12,543 --> 01:04:13,055
Work

1570
01:04:13,311 --> 01:04:14,079
Political

1571
01:04:14,591 --> 01:04:16,383
So a couple quick points first

1572
01:04:16,639 --> 01:04:17,919
Pat Robertson did run

1573
01:04:18,175 --> 01:04:21,503
President in the 1988 election did not win the early Prime

1574
01:04:23,039 --> 01:04:24,319
He did end up winning a couple

1575
01:04:24,575 --> 01:04:30,207
He took Nevada Washington state Alaska and Hawaii although the Washington one I believe

1576
01:04:30,463 --> 01:04:32,255
If I understand correctly

1577
01:04:32,511 --> 01:04:34,815
You may have one because of something like manipulations of

1578
01:04:35,071 --> 01:04:35,583
Procedural

1579
01:04:35,839 --> 01:04:39,167
Thanks there was some there's a strike on Washington

1580
01:04:39,679 --> 01:04:43,519
He didn't even make it through the entire primary cycle and he dropped out of the race on May 8th

1581
01:04:43,775 --> 01:04:45,311
16th 1988

1582
01:04:46,079 --> 01:04:49,407
Jim Bakker wasn't indicted for his mail fraud and wire fraud until December

1583
01:04:49,663 --> 01:04:51,967
1988 mistrial wouldn't happen until August

1584
01:04:53,247 --> 01:04:54,527
The timeline for this doesn't really matter

1585
01:04:55,039 --> 01:04:55,551
If it all

1586
01:04:55,807 --> 01:04:56,831
Also I suspect at the

1587
01:04:57,087 --> 01:05:02,463
The person who told him these things while he was in prison was Lyndon larouche who was his cellmate while he was in the joint

1588
01:05:02,719 --> 01:05:06,303
Lyndon larouche

1589
01:05:06,559 --> 01:05:07,071
You'll find it

1590
01:05:07,327 --> 01:05:12,191
I do not care about the second-hand prison gossip

1591
01:05:12,447 --> 01:05:13,983
It's probably coming from the

1592
01:05:15,007 --> 01:05:17,567
You're supposed to lie about

1593
01:05:18,079 --> 01:05:19,871
About being the political wing

1594
01:05:21,919 --> 01:05:25,503
Just give me a lie.

1595
01:05:25,759 --> 01:05:29,599
Delivered an election is a fine thing to say

1596
01:05:30,367 --> 01:05:30,879
I guess so

1597
01:05:31,391 --> 01:05:35,487
So this is where we get to the point where Paula

1598
01:05:35,743 --> 01:05:37,023
Who is just been here

1599
01:05:37,535 --> 01:05:38,303
And selling her book

1600
01:05:38,815 --> 01:05:39,839
Now really

1601
01:05:40,351 --> 01:05:40,863
Active

1602
01:05:41,119 --> 01:05:41,887
It helping

1603
01:05:42,143 --> 01:05:43,167
Jim trying

1604
01:05:43,423 --> 01:05:44,447
Get money

1605
01:05:44,703 --> 01:05:50,335
For his duty

1606
01:05:51,615 --> 01:05:52,127
And this is

1607
01:05:52,383 --> 01:05:53,151
So important

1608
01:05:53,663 --> 01:05:55,199
Even at ATI

1609
01:05:55,711 --> 01:05:56,479
Keep filling my

1610
01:05:56,735 --> 01:05:57,247
Spirit because

1611
01:05:57,503 --> 01:05:59,295
80s of unit number to God

1612
01:05:59,807 --> 01:06:00,831
8 of course means noob

1613
01:06:01,087 --> 01:06:01,599
Beginnings

1614
01:06:01,855 --> 01:06:02,879
10 is the number of

1615
01:06:03,647 --> 01:06:04,159
And gods

1616
01:06:04,671 --> 01:06:06,207
Hey completion that I'm doing this

1617
01:06:07,231 --> 01:06:07,743
Going to New Beginning

1618
01:06:07,999 --> 01:06:09,279
That's what

1619
01:06:09,791 --> 01:06:10,559
The cycle of Gods

1620
01:06:10,815 --> 01:06:11,327
Completion form

1621
01:06:12,607 --> 01:06:13,119
To be released in

1622
01:06:13,375 --> 01:06:14,655
Into your life and that there's no

1623
01:06:14,911 --> 01:06:16,447
Hebrew word is Quincy

1624
01:06:17,215 --> 01:06:18,751
The we know that everything that's why

1625
01:06:19,007 --> 01:06:19,519
Eternity

1626
01:06:19,775 --> 01:06:20,543
Yes it purpose

1627
01:06:21,055 --> 01:06:21,567
Has

1628
01:06:27,199 --> 01:06:27,711
Eternal purpose

1629
01:06:27,967 --> 01:06:28,735
What's your destiny

1630
01:06:29,247 --> 01:06:30,015
To build this

1631
01:06:30,271 --> 01:06:30,783
It had to be

1632
01:06:31,039 --> 01:06:31,551
Watch when you're 80

1633
01:06:31,807 --> 01:06:32,575
It might feel like a

1634
01:06:32,831 --> 01:06:33,599
Delay but it was not

1635
01:06:33,855 --> 01:06:34,367
And right now

1636
01:06:34,623 --> 01:06:35,135
Someone is about to

1637
01:06:35,391 --> 01:06:36,671
Send you that million-dollar check in

1638
01:06:37,183 --> 01:06:37,695
Jesus

1639
01:06:37,951 --> 01:06:39,743
You just see play need to be obedient

1640
01:06:39,999 --> 01:06:41,791
Weather 100,000 weather alerts

1641
01:06:42,047 --> 01:06:42,559
10000

1642
01:06:42,815 --> 01:06:43,327
$7

1643
01:06:43,583 --> 01:06:44,351
It's going to be one

1644
01:06:44,607 --> 01:06:45,375
That you have your plot

1645
01:06:45,631 --> 01:06:50,751
This is beautiful as blown away because I was like he's going to think I stole some of my stuff from him

1646
01:06:51,007 --> 01:06:53,311
Has God been downloading several things

1647
01:06:53,567 --> 01:06:54,335
Or Sosa

1648
01:06:55,871 --> 01:07:00,223
I'm planning the same scam wow f******

1649
01:07:00,479 --> 01:07:00,991
Wow

1650
01:07:01,759 --> 01:07:02,527
I I mean

1651
01:07:03,551 --> 01:07:06,111
I am a little bit in awe of her oratory prep

1652
01:07:06,879 --> 01:07:12,511
She remained her ability just keep talking yes

1653
01:07:13,023 --> 01:07:14,303
Jesus Inc

1654
01:07:14,559 --> 01:07:15,583
Marge Owen

1655
01:07:15,839 --> 01:07:17,375
She's doing the tent revivalists

1656
01:07:18,911 --> 01:07:21,471
If you actually listen to these longer clips

1657
01:07:21,727 --> 01:07:22,751
Everybody talkin

1658
01:07:23,007 --> 01:07:25,311
It's disconnected it's rambling

1659
01:07:25,567 --> 01:07:26,591
It's using

1660
01:07:26,847 --> 01:07:27,871
Rhetorical devices

1661
01:07:28,127 --> 01:07:30,431
Where you say like similarly framed

1662
01:07:30,687 --> 01:07:36,831
Fragments heatedly God is love God is well God is Faith is like what

1663
01:07:37,087 --> 01:07:38,879
Repetition trying to come up with the next

1664
01:07:39,135 --> 01:07:43,231
Can you say I got done stand-up enough to know that like sometimes you forget where you're going

1665
01:07:43,487 --> 01:07:44,767
And you have just little things

1666
01:07:45,023 --> 01:07:49,375
You can say yeah to like fill time while I call that's my next day alright I'll get into

1667
01:07:49,631 --> 01:07:50,655
So much

1668
01:07:50,911 --> 01:07:53,215
A sort of rhetorical prowess

1669
01:07:53,471 --> 01:07:54,495
Is just those tricks

1670
01:07:54,751 --> 01:07:55,519
The same things that you

1671
01:07:55,775 --> 01:08:00,127
You do it over to be like okay I know how to make it sound like I have a point

1672
01:08:00,639 --> 01:08:05,247
And that's kind of a twelve-year-old kid

1673
01:08:05,503 --> 01:08:08,319
Thousand

1674
01:08:08,575 --> 01:08:10,111
There's these tricks work

1675
01:08:11,135 --> 01:08:12,671
So I find it

1676
01:08:12,927 --> 01:08:13,695
Tasteful

1677
01:08:14,207 --> 01:08:18,815
That she now has an official job in the government and she's on Jim Bakker Show saying like

1678
01:08:19,327 --> 01:08:19,839
Hey

1679
01:08:20,095 --> 01:08:25,215
You asking for $1,000 for a plaque Christian Prophet Network

1680
01:08:25,727 --> 01:08:28,287
You're going to think I ripped you off cuz I'm doing that

1681
01:08:28,543 --> 01:08:29,823
Do that

1682
01:08:30,335 --> 01:08:31,103
You work in the government

1683
01:08:31,359 --> 01:08:31,871
Now

1684
01:08:33,151 --> 01:08:34,175
This is distasteful

1685
01:08:34,431 --> 01:08:35,199
It's a never-ending

1686
01:08:35,455 --> 01:08:36,223
Exorcist 2

1687
01:08:36,735 --> 01:08:38,271
Isn't that that's that's so

1688
01:08:39,807 --> 01:08:40,319
Like

1689
01:08:41,855 --> 01:08:42,623
So much money

1690
01:08:42,879 --> 01:08:43,903
You got more money than you

1691
01:08:44,671 --> 01:08:46,975
Feed bugs and all you can think to do is

1692
01:08:47,487 --> 01:08:49,279
Try and scam more people out of

1693
01:08:49,791 --> 01:08:50,559
F****** dollars

1694
01:08:52,863 --> 01:08:55,167
He's not getting $10,000 donations

1695
01:08:55,423 --> 01:08:55,935
You getting

1696
01:08:56,191 --> 01:09:02,335
Five bucks from people who f****** need 5 bucks maybe you know a thousand dollars

1697
01:09:04,383 --> 01:09:06,431
Yeah absolutely but look dude what you don't

1698
01:09:07,199 --> 01:09:07,711
Is

1699
01:09:07,967 --> 01:09:08,479
That

1700
01:09:08,735 --> 01:09:09,503
This money

1701
01:09:10,015 --> 01:09:11,039
There's a ledger sheet

1702
01:09:12,063 --> 01:09:12,575
In heaven

1703
01:09:12,831 --> 01:09:14,367
Every treasure you give

1704
01:09:14,623 --> 01:09:15,135
If you're on Earth

1705
01:09:15,391 --> 01:09:17,183
Is being stored up in heaven

1706
01:09:17,439 --> 01:09:18,207
There is

1707
01:09:18,463 --> 01:09:19,999
Department of Treasury

1708
01:09:20,255 --> 01:09:23,583
Inhabit now I know mnuchin's over down here but I'm telling you

1709
01:09:23,839 --> 01:09:25,119
There's a department of

1710
01:09:25,375 --> 01:09:25,887
Treasury

1711
01:09:26,143 --> 01:09:27,423
In heaven that God

1712
01:09:27,679 --> 01:09:29,727
Is watching over everything you do

1713
01:09:29,983 --> 01:09:30,751
And you are

1714
01:09:31,007 --> 01:09:32,543
Storing up Eternal treasure

1715
01:09:32,799 --> 01:09:36,383
It will go so far beyond I think that we can even begin to imagine

1716
01:09:36,639 --> 01:09:38,687
You are mandated by God

1717
01:09:39,199 --> 01:09:40,479
Willimantic I know I'm

1718
01:09:40,735 --> 01:09:42,015
I was supposed to come share my book

1719
01:09:42,271 --> 01:09:43,295
But I feel a mandate to help

1720
01:09:43,551 --> 01:09:44,063
You build this

1721
01:09:44,319 --> 01:09:44,831
And gods

1722
01:09:45,087 --> 01:09:45,855
Has removed the pressure

1723
01:09:46,111 --> 01:09:47,647
Move the burden that you are not

1724
01:09:48,159 --> 01:09:48,671
Kerry burden

1725
01:09:49,183 --> 01:09:50,463
That would stress you out

1726
01:09:50,719 --> 01:09:51,487
It would make you physically

1727
01:09:51,743 --> 01:09:54,303
Yogurt to live well over 100 years

1728
01:09:55,839 --> 01:09:59,167
I'm telling you in the I know this spiritually because there is much

1729
01:09:59,679 --> 01:10:00,447

1730
01:10:00,703 --> 01:10:01,215

1731
01:10:01,471 --> 01:10:05,823
Stretch your body stretch your mind and listen there is no stress on him

1732
01:10:06,079 --> 01:10:12,223
By the spirit of God is hip trying to get the gospel out which means that somebody needs to do their part and

1733
01:10:12,479 --> 01:10:18,623
You were that somebody and when you step up your life is about to be revolutionized how do you think I got out of that

1734
01:10:18,879 --> 01:10:21,439
Trailer God is about to make a supernatural wafer

1735
01:10:21,695 --> 01:10:24,767
For you right now and your obedience to standings

1736
01:10:25,023 --> 01:10:28,863

1738
01:10:30,399 --> 01:10:30,911
Is God

1739
01:10:31,167 --> 01:10:32,959
Scream because he knows you'll be obedient

1740
01:10:33,215 --> 01:10:36,543
And that's what God wants it so you're not watching by coincidence

1741
01:10:37,055 --> 01:10:43,199
God wants to heal you he wants to bring you into yourself in Greater but you got to line up here when you line up your something

1742
01:10:43,455 --> 01:10:44,991
Greater gets really a man

1743
01:10:46,783 --> 01:10:47,807
That's wow

1744
01:10:48,063 --> 01:10:49,599
Insane wow

1745
01:10:49,855 --> 01:10:51,391
She's talking directly to the people watching

1746
01:10:51,647 --> 01:10:52,415
Home wow

1747
01:10:52,671 --> 01:10:54,463
You need to obey

1748
01:10:54,719 --> 01:10:56,255
Wow

1749
01:10:56,511 --> 01:10:57,023
Fuct

1750
01:10:57,279 --> 01:10:58,815
What's so interesting about this

1751
01:10:59,071 --> 01:11:00,095
Is that there's a

1752
01:11:00,607 --> 01:11:01,119
Believe that

1753
01:11:01,375 --> 01:11:03,167
He's expressing the people like Jim

1754
01:11:03,679 --> 01:11:04,959
Shouldn't have to feel stress

1755
01:11:05,471 --> 01:11:07,775
You'd be relieved of the stress of the

1756
01:11:08,031 --> 01:11:13,663
Millions of dollars that they're trying to make in order to operate exactly how their operating now

1757
01:11:14,175 --> 01:11:19,551
You should be relieved the stress of having an extra thousand dollars that you don't know what to do with that's the

1758
01:11:19,807 --> 01:11:21,343
I mean that's a fun way to say

1759
01:11:21,599 --> 01:11:23,391
In reality she's

1760
01:11:23,647 --> 01:11:24,159
Not

1761
01:11:24,671 --> 01:11:25,439
It all

1762
01:11:25,951 --> 01:11:26,975
Recognizing

1763
01:11:27,231 --> 01:11:27,999
The stress of

1764
01:11:28,255 --> 01:11:30,303
Everyday people who they are targeting

1765
01:11:30,559 --> 01:11:32,351
No

1766
01:11:32,607 --> 01:11:33,119
Cruel

1767
01:11:33,887 --> 01:11:34,911
Imagine.

1768
01:11:35,167 --> 01:11:35,679
If you

1769
01:11:35,935 --> 01:11:37,215
Imagine hearing that

1770
01:11:37,471 --> 01:11:39,775
And not think a like if that's your brand of

1771
01:11:40,287 --> 01:11:45,407
Christianity or if that's the only brand of Christianity been exposure but imagine listen to that and not coming to

1772
01:11:45,919 --> 01:11:48,479
Conclusion that Christianity is a fundamentally corrupt

1773
01:11:49,247 --> 01:11:50,271
You know like just

1774
01:11:52,319 --> 01:11:52,831
Man

1775
01:11:53,087 --> 01:11:53,855
Hayhurst

1776
01:11:54,111 --> 01:11:55,903
It's so much for

1777
01:11:56,159 --> 01:11:58,975
Making me try and defend the ideal of what

1778
01:11:59,487 --> 01:12:01,791
Text Bots

1779
01:12:03,583 --> 01:12:06,399
Or whatever I don't know

1780
01:12:06,655 --> 01:12:08,191
Through these sort of

1781
01:12:08,447 --> 01:12:09,471
Minute examples that

1782
01:12:09,727 --> 01:12:12,031
Good versions of religion become very

1783
01:12:12,287 --> 01:12:13,823
Clearly identifiable

1784
01:12:14,079 --> 01:12:16,127
I think maybe there's some value them exist

1785
01:12:16,383 --> 01:12:18,687
Sing for that but I also think they do way more damage

1786
01:12:18,943 --> 01:12:21,503
I think there's value of them existing Animusic

1787
01:12:22,271 --> 01:12:23,551
Maybe there's an interesting

1788
01:12:23,807 --> 01:12:24,575
Something that she's bi

1789
01:12:25,087 --> 01:12:26,623
Presenting here though that

1790
01:12:26,879 --> 01:12:27,903
Did you know

1791
01:12:28,159 --> 01:12:29,951
If you're the person who believes

1792
01:12:30,975 --> 01:12:32,255
Nothing and you're watching this

1793
01:12:33,023 --> 01:12:34,559
And you have Paula White

1794
01:12:35,583 --> 01:12:37,887
She is someone who is a luminary

1795
01:12:38,143 --> 01:12:39,423
In the Evangelical world

1796
01:12:39,935 --> 01:12:45,567
To the point where she now works in the f****** whiteout really don't like you say credibly credible person

She has religious cloud

1799

Called him to

To create this new voice of the

1803
01:13:01,183 --> 01:13:03,487
The prophets Network because prophets need a place

God is golden he must do this so he has to do this I came on to talk about my

1805

Scented with

1816
01:13:29,599 --> 01:13:30,623
A couple of possibilities

1817
01:13:31,135 --> 01:13:36,511
What is that I don't have the money I can't do it like you literally don't have the money then you feel like what I can't

1818
01:13:36,767 --> 01:13:37,535
Be a part of this

1819
01:13:37,791 --> 01:13:38,559
Religious thing

1820
01:13:38,815 --> 01:13:40,863
Or you do have the money

1821
01:13:41,887 --> 01:13:42,399
Going to give it then

Not just that you're killing Jim Bakker

1824
01:13:46,495 --> 01:13:47,263
Your disobedience

1825
01:13:47,519 --> 01:13:48,031

You have to do it or else or else your will punish your creating

1830
01:14:01,087 --> 01:14:02,623
Dichotomy

1831
01:14:02,879 --> 01:14:03,391
Choice

1832
01:14:04,159 --> 01:14:06,207
Abusive no matter what you choose to do

1833
01:14:07,231 --> 01:14:08,511
It's just a trap

1834
01:14:09,279 --> 01:14:12,607
This is a sick trap that she's putting people into

1835
01:14:12,863 --> 01:14:15,167
Who have gone far enough to believe

1836
01:14:15,935 --> 01:14:16,959
The virgin

1837
01:14:17,215 --> 01:14:18,751
Of religion that she's putting for

1838
01:14:19,519 --> 01:14:20,287
And I just

1839
01:14:20,799 --> 01:14:21,823
I think it's gross

1840
01:14:22,335 --> 01:14:23,103
It's so sick

1841
01:14:23,359 --> 01:14:24,639
It's cynical and in

1842
01:14:24,895 --> 01:14:26,175
In a really abusive

1843
01:14:26,687 --> 01:14:27,455
It really is

1844
01:14:28,991 --> 01:14:29,759
Play f****** parasite

1845
01:14:30,271 --> 01:14:31,039
Siphoning off

1846
01:14:34,367 --> 01:14:34,879
Worshipper for

1847
01:14:36,671 --> 01:14:37,183
Mind-boggling

1848
01:14:37,439 --> 01:14:37,951
But

1849
01:14:38,463 --> 01:14:40,511
It's not like Polly won't put her money where her mouth

1850
01:14:42,815 --> 01:14:46,655
If they can go get my check and write a thousand dollars right now

1851
01:14:47,167 --> 01:14:47,935
There's the obvious

1852
01:14:48,191 --> 01:14:49,983
The first movie The First One

1853
01:14:53,055 --> 01:14:57,663
Going to need a receipt for that

1854
01:14:57,919 --> 01:15:00,735

Will you run get my purse in the back.

01:15:12,767 --> 01:15:15,071
They already put on the screen the $10,000

1860
01:15:15,327 --> 01:15:16,607
Which is the profit

1861
01:15:16,863 --> 01:15:17,887
Armor Bearer

1862
01:15:19,935 --> 01:15:20,959
Those are people

1863
01:15:21,215 --> 01:15:23,775
Not only to help me do the studio

1864
01:15:24,031 --> 01:15:24,543
Especially

1865
01:15:25,055 --> 01:15:26,847
Going to be helping

1866
01:15:27,359 --> 01:15:28,127
Weather

1867
01:15:28,383 --> 01:15:28,895
The

1868
01:15:29,663 --> 01:15:30,431
Chamber you know the

1869
01:15:30,687 --> 01:15:33,247
The prophets chamber could you hear about the prophet chamber and

1870
01:15:33,503 --> 01:15:34,271
Hey Meghan King

6

1872
01:15:39,135 --> 01:15:40,415
But the Bible says

1873
01:15:40,671 --> 01:15:41,695
When you

1874
01:15:42,207 --> 01:15:43,231
Give to a prophet

1875
01:15:43,487 --> 01:15:45,279
You receive a prophet's reward

1876
01:15:45,535 --> 01:15:47,071
Amen and I believe in God

1877
01:15:47,839 --> 01:15:50,911
To folks that will say Jim I just going to join this $10,000

1878
01:15:51,679 --> 01:15:52,959
Armor-bearer we call it

1879
01:15:53,215 --> 01:15:53,727
For the prophet

1880
01:15:54,495 --> 01:15:55,775
This is so vital

1881
01:15:56,031 --> 01:15:57,823
People that I am bone way because

1882
01:15:58,079 --> 01:16:00,127
Cuz what you're doing for him to have a studio

1883
01:16:00,383 --> 01:16:01,151
In Florida it's almost

1884
01:16:01,663 --> 01:16:02,431
I'm sitting here going this

1885
01:16:02,943 --> 01:16:04,479
Just like God is speaking

1886
01:16:04,735 --> 01:16:08,319
This is exactly what I'm doing in Florida this is amazing

1887
01:16:11,135 --> 01:16:17,279
Still wouldn't be compelled by this but I would think it would be interesting if you know

1888
01:16:17,535 --> 01:16:23,679
I'll give you $1,000 and then Jim's like the $10,000 level if I did not give you something

1889
01:16:23,935 --> 01:16:24,447
I'm sorry

1890
01:16:25,215 --> 01:16:27,263
I can

1891
01:16:27,519 --> 01:16:29,311
A million of those but I cannot

1892
01:16:32,127 --> 01:16:32,895
In the 50

1893
01:16:36,223 --> 01:16:37,247
Revealing has stupid

1894
01:16:38,015 --> 01:16:41,855
We're like your your grandpa's armor level people were like that's f****** stupid

1895
01:16:42,111 --> 01:16:44,671
Prophets armor level f*** off

1896
01:16:45,183 --> 01:16:51,327
There's an interesting thing your we're like the conversation around this this network in the

1897
01:16:51,839 --> 01:16:52,863
Being obedient

1898
01:16:53,375 --> 01:16:54,143
Is Donald

1899
01:16:54,399 --> 01:16:56,447
Thousand-dollar level witches

1900
01:16:56,703 --> 01:17:00,031
Still a lot of money for somebody sending Jim Bakker

1901
01:17:00,799 --> 01:17:01,311
But it's

1902
01:17:01,567 --> 01:17:02,591
Not in the realm of

1903
01:17:02,847 --> 01:17:03,359
Comical

1904
01:17:03,615 --> 01:17:04,127
Kind of

1905
01:17:04,383 --> 01:17:05,407
You know it's not

1906
01:17:05,663 --> 01:17:11,807
It's not to the point where you're like get the f*** out of here

1907
01:17:12,063 --> 01:17:14,367
The idea of giving him this amount of money in the

1908
01:17:15,135 --> 01:17:15,647
Text of like

1909
01:17:15,903 --> 01:17:16,671
It's obedience

1910
01:17:16,927 --> 01:17:18,463
To give it to Jim

1911
01:17:18,719 --> 01:17:20,255
And then you escalate a little bit

1912
01:17:20,511 --> 01:17:26,655
So now this $10,000 level it's all the other stuff we talked about the thousand-dollar level it still apply

1913
01:17:26,911 --> 01:17:28,959
Still in there. You get bored

1914
01:17:29,983 --> 01:17:30,751
It's an escalation

1915
01:17:31,775 --> 01:17:33,567
So you know it's important

1916
01:17:33,823 --> 01:17:34,335
But there are profit

1917
01:17:34,847 --> 01:17:35,871
And they speak

1918
01:17:36,127 --> 01:17:38,175
And it's not just because profits are psychic

1919
01:17:38,431 --> 01:17:39,711
That's that small potatoes

1920
01:17:40,735 --> 01:17:44,831
It's because they are able to wheel words of God in

1921
01:17:45,343 --> 01:17:48,927
Existence is something I really don't think that's true this is weird

1922
01:17:49,439 --> 01:17:49,951
Without a

1923
01:17:50,207 --> 01:17:50,719
Prophetic word

1924
01:17:51,487 --> 01:17:52,255
Then the people

1925
01:17:52,767 --> 01:17:55,327
So when the priest mouth was open and the prophets mouth

1926
01:17:56,095 --> 01:17:56,607
People prosper

1927
01:17:57,119 --> 01:17:58,143
And prosperity is not

1928
01:17:58,399 --> 01:17:58,911
Got money

1929
01:17:59,167 --> 01:17:59,679
Prosper mean

1930
01:17:59,935 --> 01:18:00,447
To advance

1931
01:18:00,703 --> 01:18:01,727
Breakout to break through

1932
01:18:01,983 --> 01:18:02,495
Brake Force

1933
01:18:02,751 --> 01:18:04,543
It means there's no way you're going to be able to

1934
01:18:04,799 --> 01:18:05,823
Breakout breakthrough break

1935
01:18:06,079 --> 01:18:07,103
For without that purr

1936
01:18:07,359 --> 01:18:07,871
Prophetic word

1937
01:18:08,127 --> 01:18:08,895
It is not

1938
01:18:09,151 --> 01:18:09,663
Just

1939
01:18:09,919 --> 01:18:11,455
Foretelling but styling

1940
01:18:11,711 --> 01:18:14,527
To win a prophet in their many true prophet

1941
01:18:14,783 --> 01:18:15,551
It's in the Earth right now

1942
01:18:15,807 --> 01:18:17,855
When the prophet comes fortnite

1943
01:18:19,391 --> 01:18:20,927
Don't just for tell it's not just

1944
01:18:21,183 --> 01:18:21,951
It's not like a

1945
01:18:22,207 --> 01:18:24,767
Psychic or something I mean familiar spirits can do that

1946
01:18:25,023 --> 01:18:25,535
It has

1947
01:18:25,791 --> 01:18:27,071
What God

1948
01:18:27,583 --> 01:18:31,423
Do not only download the word of knowledge the word of wisdom Discerning of spirits

1949
01:18:31,679 --> 01:18:32,959
What is the prophetic word

1950
01:18:33,983 --> 01:18:37,567
So it's not just for telling it's telling for that shifting you into a

1951
01:18:37,823 --> 01:18:39,359
Which is what ecclesiastic

1952
01:18:39,615 --> 01:18:40,639
Stories of all about

1953
01:18:40,895 --> 01:18:42,431
The gospel eternity in your heart

1954
01:18:42,687 --> 01:18:44,479
To the will of God can come to pass

1955
01:18:45,503 --> 01:18:46,527
So when the prophet

1956
01:18:46,783 --> 01:18:47,551
Get the direction

1957
01:18:47,807 --> 01:18:49,599
Then the intercessors have to come in

1958
01:18:50,111 --> 01:18:50,623
I'm praying

1959
01:18:50,879 --> 01:18:53,439
Through which is why you got your

1960
01:18:53,695 --> 01:18:55,231
Have you got a chapel over here

1961
01:18:55,487 --> 01:18:56,767
So that the people can pray

1962
01:18:57,023 --> 01:18:59,839
What the prophetic word is and you say what

1963
01:19:00,095 --> 01:19:02,655
Is important because if somebody doesn't do it next

1964
01:19:02,911 --> 01:19:04,447
Actions are going to go down

1965
01:19:04,959 --> 01:19:06,751
It's just that simple to right now

1966
01:19:07,007 --> 01:19:07,519
At the PO box

That is should be f****** a homeless

1977
01:19:27,999 --> 01:19:30,047
He should be homeless

1978
01:19:30,303 --> 01:19:31,327
Because she is the type of

1979
01:19:31,583 --> 01:19:35,167
The person who is begging for your money who would s*** on a homeless person

1980
01:19:35,679 --> 01:19:36,191
If they ask

1981
01:19:36,447 --> 01:19:39,775
She might actually in a couple clips

1982
01:19:40,287 --> 01:19:42,079
She's a f******

1983
01:19:42,335 --> 01:19:43,103
Yeah

1984
01:19:43,359 --> 01:19:46,175
You see so clearly there this

1985
01:19:46,431 --> 01:19:47,711
Like okay so you need the place where the

1986
01:19:47,967 --> 01:19:48,479
CrossFit

1987
01:19:48,735 --> 01:19:49,503
Can come and speak

1988
01:19:49,759 --> 01:19:55,903
We also need all the intercessors depraved well course that's why you have your compound here

1989

What uses rude for her

1992
01:20:12,799 --> 01:20:13,824
That is

1993
01:20:14,080 --> 01:20:14,848
F***** up

1994
01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:19,200
Not least because profits are apparently just

1995
01:20:19,712 --> 01:20:25,856
Chiropractors they're just going to align you better they're not going to bring anything they're not going to actually bring anything into exist

1996
01:20:26,112 --> 01:20:28,928
With what is

1997
01:20:30,208 --> 01:20:30,976
God

1998
01:20:31,232 --> 01:20:31,744
That was a

1999
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:32,768
Big pilot.

2000
01:20:33,280 --> 01:20:33,792
It definitely is

2001
01:20:34,816 --> 01:20:35,840
So they can move on

2002
01:20:36,096 --> 01:20:39,424
From this poet does come up alot the giving the

2003
01:20:39,680 --> 01:20:41,984
The money for the the new Chapel

2004
01:20:42,496 --> 01:20:44,032
Studio

2005
01:20:44,544 --> 01:20:45,568
AMW

2006
01:20:45,824 --> 01:20:49,920
I think it's more important really to focus on what they get into after this

2007
01:20:50,176 --> 01:20:52,224
Which is some of the more like I know she's not.

2008
01:20:53,248 --> 01:20:54,016
She's not she's awful

2009
01:20:54,528 --> 01:20:57,088
But it's important to recognize

2010
01:20:57,344 --> 01:20:58,624
Is this through Pala

2011
01:20:59,392 --> 01:21:01,952
Jim Bakker has a direct line to the White House

2012
01:21:02,720 --> 01:21:06,304
She became the first woman to pray at the inauguration

2013
01:21:06,816 --> 01:21:08,352
Using the name of Jesus

2014
01:21:08,608 --> 01:21:09,120
And she

2015
01:21:09,632 --> 01:21:10,144
And your other

2016
01:21:10,400 --> 01:21:11,424
Ministries that you help

2017
01:21:11,680 --> 01:21:17,824
Doing it everyday and I was praying everyday and worshipping in the White House

2018
01:21:18,080 --> 01:21:24,224
When we Coronavirus

2019
01:21:25,248 --> 01:21:25,760
Hahaha

2020
01:21:26,016 --> 01:21:28,064
Orchestrating

2021
01:21:28,576 --> 01:21:31,392
August direct line is direct connection between

2022
01:21:31,904 --> 01:21:34,720
Kim Foxx like Jim Bakker in the in the White House

2023
01:21:34,976 --> 01:21:36,000
Yep this is

2024
01:21:36,256 --> 01:21:37,792
How you end up

2025
01:21:38,048 --> 01:21:39,584
This is one of the things it's like

2026
01:21:41,120 --> 01:21:41,888
It's so easy

2027
01:21:42,144 --> 01:21:44,448
For them now yeah it is so easy

2028
01:21:44,704 --> 01:21:46,240
Someone like Trump is so

2029
01:21:47,008 --> 01:21:47,776
Very easy

2030
01:21:48,032 --> 01:21:48,800
For them to

2031
01:21:49,056 --> 01:21:50,080
I don't know how much of it is

2032
01:21:50,336 --> 01:21:51,616
Playing him and how much of it

2033
01:21:51,872 --> 01:21:52,384
Just like

2034
01:21:54,944 --> 01:21:56,992
But whatever it is like okay

2035
01:21:57,248 --> 01:22:01,344
This is good there is the question that I have to recognize this is like

2036
01:22:02,368 --> 01:22:05,952
What's going on in the world right now is so f***** up

2037
01:22:06,208 --> 01:22:07,488
But this is like issue

2038
01:22:07,744 --> 01:22:09,280
30

2039
01:22:09,792 --> 01:22:11,840
Instable find X

2040
01:22:12,096 --> 01:22:18,240
This would be a very pressing issue problem

2041
01:22:18,496 --> 01:22:20,800
It will be easily very quick left

2042
01:22:21,056 --> 01:22:23,104
To its own devices this doesn't get better

2043
01:22:23,360 --> 01:22:25,664
Yeah and I don't see any reason

2044
01:22:26,432 --> 01:22:27,200
Why would stop

2045
01:22:28,224 --> 01:22:31,296
But like that that's what's so crazy about about the world right now

2046
01:22:31,808 --> 01:22:32,576
Is just like

2047
01:22:33,088 --> 01:22:35,392
I see this is a very very very soon

2048
01:22:36,672 --> 01:22:38,464
But I also recognize

2049
01:22:38,720 --> 01:22:39,232
But it doesn't

2050
01:22:39,744 --> 01:22:40,256
Yeah

2051
01:22:41,536 --> 01:22:42,304
So

2052
01:22:42,560 --> 01:22:44,096
You know again she's not political

2053
01:22:44,352 --> 01:22:47,424
But Trump is going to get rid of the Johnson to me

2054
01:22:48,192 --> 01:22:52,544
Super into this is where we get to

2055
01:22:52,800 --> 01:22:53,568
Can about someone

2056
01:22:54,848 --> 01:22:57,152
And that Johnson amendment in the buck

2057
01:22:57,408 --> 01:22:59,200
Which the thing holding a rat

2058
01:22:59,968 --> 01:23:02,528
Your President Donald Trump that you work with

2059
01:23:03,040 --> 01:23:03,552
Said

2060
01:23:04,064 --> 01:23:04,832
We're going to stop it

2061
01:23:05,088 --> 01:23:08,928
Because he looked down we were up 26 warranty look down he goes

2062
01:23:09,184 --> 01:23:10,720
That guy he said you

2063
01:23:10,976 --> 01:23:14,048
He gets it he understands the church

2064
01:23:14,304 --> 01:23:17,376
I said the church is the only legal entity and the Earth

2065
01:23:17,632 --> 01:23:18,656
It has the authority

2066
01:23:18,912 --> 01:23:20,192
To bring true transformation

2067
01:23:20,448 --> 01:23:21,472
And President Trump

2068
01:23:21,728 --> 01:23:23,008
What that

2069
01:23:23,264 --> 01:23:26,848
Hornet and the power of the Blood Bought Church of Jesus Christ

2070
01:23:27,104 --> 01:23:29,408
And he said you were the most powerful people

2071
01:23:29,664 --> 01:23:30,944
He's saying this to Pastor

2072
01:23:31,200 --> 01:23:35,296
Cuz he knows that Fitbit is the word of God that transforms a life

2073
01:23:35,808 --> 01:23:39,392
And he said but that guy down the street there that homeless guy

2074
01:23:39,648 --> 01:23:40,160
Has more

2075
01:23:40,416 --> 01:23:41,952
Power than you do in your pulpit

2076
01:23:42,208 --> 01:23:43,488
To make a change

2077
01:23:43,744 --> 01:23:44,512
And he said

2078
01:23:44,768 --> 01:23:47,840
I'm Preston is a. Not going to happen

2079
01:23:48,096 --> 01:23:48,608
And it has

2080
01:23:49,376 --> 01:23:49,888
Jesus

2081
01:23:50,144 --> 01:23:50,656
Or boy

2082
01:23:51,168 --> 01:23:52,448
Yeah that's not good

2083
01:23:53,984 --> 01:23:55,520
I wonder I wonder is

2084
01:23:56,800 --> 01:23:59,104
Like I wonder what is going on in those me

2085
01:23:59,616 --> 01:24:01,664
Like I wonder if she is cunning

2086
01:24:01,920 --> 01:24:02,432
Trump

2087
01:24:02,688 --> 01:24:03,968
Or if they have a

2088
01:24:04,224 --> 01:24:04,992
A business agreement

2089
01:24:05,504 --> 01:24:06,016
As equals

2090
01:24:06,272 --> 01:24:08,832
Do you know everything yeah I don't know I can't speak to that

2091
01:24:09,088 --> 01:24:09,600
Hey

2092
01:24:09,856 --> 01:24:11,648
You you deliver me this

2093
01:24:11,904 --> 01:24:12,416
Voting

2094
01:24:12,672 --> 01:24:14,464
Right I will say f******

2095
01:24:14,720 --> 01:24:19,840
Go hog-wild I have no idea I couldn't even begin to speculate about that but it doesn't it doesn't

2096
01:24:20,608 --> 01:24:22,144
Like either would Shock Me

2097
01:24:22,656 --> 01:24:23,424
Exactly

2098
01:24:23,680 --> 01:24:26,496
I think it's probably more likely that there's like an

2099
01:24:27,008 --> 01:24:31,360
Between between

2100
01:24:31,616 --> 01:24:32,384
Didn't recognize

2101
01:24:32,640 --> 01:24:36,736
It's not like you could probably be around Paula white-cain for very long without being like

2102
01:24:37,248 --> 01:24:38,016
Thumbs up

2103
01:24:38,272 --> 01:24:39,296
Even if you're oblivious

2104
01:24:39,552 --> 01:24:41,856
Kanika kind of get what's going on so

2105
01:24:42,112 --> 01:24:43,136
I would be surprised if

2106
01:24:43,392 --> 01:24:44,416
It's an outright Khan

2107
01:24:44,672 --> 01:24:46,208
And more of like a hey

2108
01:24:46,464 --> 01:24:48,000
There's a lot for you to gain

2109
01:24:48,256 --> 01:24:51,840
From keeping a Stranglehold on the Evangelical vote in the country

2110
01:24:52,096 --> 01:24:53,120
And

2111
01:24:53,376 --> 01:24:54,656
There's a lot for me to gain

2112
01:24:55,168 --> 01:24:58,752
If you get rid of certain regulations about how churches can operate

2113
01:24:59,264 --> 01:24:59,776
So

2114
01:25:00,032 --> 01:25:00,544
Let's

2115
01:25:03,104 --> 01:25:05,664
So look dude the issue is that she's not political

2116
01:25:06,176 --> 01:25:07,968
But why would you want to get rid of the

2117
01:25:10,272 --> 01:25:12,064
Wow because that's about God

2118
01:25:15,392 --> 01:25:16,928
The freedom is going to disappear

2119
01:25:17,952 --> 01:25:20,512
Sure as they get their way unless

2120
01:25:21,792 --> 01:25:24,864
In 25 the freedom of America soon if we don't

2121
01:25:25,120 --> 01:25:31,264
This election is so important and it just scares me what is going on

2122
01:25:31,520 --> 01:25:32,032
We already know

2123
01:25:32,288 --> 01:25:32,800
It is

2124
01:25:33,056 --> 01:25:33,824
Potential

2125
01:25:34,080 --> 01:25:35,616
Third one we didn't need the time

2126
01:25:35,872 --> 01:25:37,408
But it is very potential

2127
01:25:37,664 --> 01:25:39,200
We could have a 4:30 even if it

2128
01:25:39,456 --> 01:25:40,480
Now that makes

2129
01:25:40,736 --> 01:25:42,528
Let me tell you what that makes some people do

2130
01:25:42,784 --> 01:25:43,552
That's going to make

2131
01:25:44,064 --> 01:25:45,600
Dispense into it is a device

2132
01:25:46,112 --> 01:25:47,648
Toosii

2133
01:25:47,904 --> 01:25:53,280
Because it's going to either make you stand and have to look in your word and say what does the word of God saying where do I line up

2134
01:25:54,048 --> 01:25:55,328
Where do I buy not Impala

2135
01:25:55,840 --> 01:26:01,984
I might not like the personality I might not understand and get my book and you'll understand the personality and you'll understand

2136
01:26:02,240 --> 01:26:03,264
Person okay

2137
01:26:03,520 --> 01:26:04,544
You're not just a persona

2138
01:26:05,056 --> 01:26:05,568
But

2139
01:26:05,824 --> 01:26:06,848
Where do I line up

2140
01:26:07,104 --> 01:26:10,432
And you're going to have to make a decision that won't be just held accountable here

2141
01:26:10,688 --> 01:26:14,528
How things turn out for you your children or grandchildren

2142
01:26:14,784 --> 01:26:20,416
Stand accountable before 1-day not based on your opinion you're hurt you're wounding what you think what you don't

2143
01:26:20,672 --> 01:26:21,696
Educate yourself

2144
01:26:21,952 --> 01:26:24,000
Know the issues know the word of God

2145
01:26:24,256 --> 01:26:27,072
And then if you cannot align with the word of God

2146
01:26:27,328 --> 01:26:27,840
I just

2147
01:26:28,096 --> 01:26:31,936
I don't see it so if we can change the Supreme Court

2148
01:26:32,192 --> 01:26:35,264
Like we are already changing it and we can neither

2149
01:26:35,520 --> 01:26:36,288
Lifetime appointment

2150
01:26:36,800 --> 01:26:39,616
You don't think all hell is trembling right now

2151
01:26:40,128 --> 01:26:46,272
I am traveling right now

2152
01:26:46,528 --> 01:26:48,576
Is it freedom is going to disappear unless

2153
01:26:48,832 --> 01:26:51,904
Trumpkin fundamentally reshape the Supreme Court towards more

2154
01:26:52,416 --> 01:26:55,232
Extremist religious Christian views

2155
01:26:55,744 --> 01:26:57,280
So she's not political

2156
01:26:58,816 --> 01:27:01,376
Neither weed it's it's

2157
01:27:01,632 --> 01:27:02,144
Interesting

2158
01:27:02,400 --> 01:27:04,704
For that to be such a

2159
01:27:05,472 --> 01:27:05,984
Such a

2160
01:27:06,240 --> 01:27:06,752
Thing

2161
01:27:07,008 --> 01:27:08,544
I understand

2162
01:27:11,104 --> 01:27:13,408
A place of like not owning your

2163
01:27:13,664 --> 01:27:14,176
Place

2164
01:27:14,432 --> 01:27:17,504
Your place in the system

2165
01:27:17,760 --> 01:27:18,784
Please find really

2166
01:27:19,040 --> 01:27:19,552
Layman

2167
01:27:21,344 --> 01:27:23,648
I want to be involved in advocating

2168
01:27:23,904 --> 01:27:25,440
Fundamentalist religious

2169
01:27:25,696 --> 01:27:26,208
Positions

2170
01:27:26,720 --> 01:27:27,744
Vet spillover in

2171
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:28,512
Politics

2172
01:27:28,768 --> 01:27:30,048
I now work in the White House

2173
01:27:30,560 --> 01:27:31,072
I'm not into

2174
01:27:32,608 --> 01:27:33,632
It's just

2175
01:27:33,888 --> 01:27:34,912
Lame it just lame

2176
01:27:35,424 --> 01:27:36,704
And here she drifted apart

2177
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:39,008
Takes a little more in a very dishonest

2178
01:27:39,776 --> 01:27:43,360
I can tell you things right now in certain States they've already passed lunch

2179
01:27:43,616 --> 01:27:44,384
Just like Shannon state

2180
01:27:44,640 --> 01:27:45,920
It says the Bible is

2181
01:27:46,176 --> 01:27:47,200
The book of hate speech

2182
01:27:47,712 --> 01:27:50,272
It is only a matter of time

2183
01:27:50,784 --> 01:27:52,064
Laws already passed

2184
01:27:52,576 --> 01:27:53,088
People are sleep

2185
01:27:53,344 --> 01:27:53,856
In my opinion

2186
01:27:54,368 --> 01:27:56,160
Do you think this next election

2187
01:27:56,416 --> 01:27:58,464
Could change America forever if

2188
01:27:58,720 --> 01:27:59,232
The wrong way

2189
01:27:59,488 --> 01:28:00,512
No Doubt

2190
01:28:01,536 --> 01:28:02,048
Absolutely

2191
01:28:02,560 --> 01:28:08,192
So when people like Paula say things like that when they tried to save their laws being passed the declare the Bible hate speech

2192
01:28:08,704 --> 01:28:11,776
Really important to get down to what the laws actually are that they're talking

2193
01:28:12,544 --> 01:28:15,104
Because I've seen other sermons that she's given I know that you

2194
01:28:15,616 --> 01:28:17,152
Pacifically talking about a law in California

2195
01:28:17,408 --> 01:28:19,200
Sensitive very common talking point

2196
01:28:19,456 --> 01:28:21,248
For her as well as other dumb dumb television

2197
01:28:22,528 --> 01:28:25,600
The law that she's talking about is assembly Bill 2943

2198
01:28:25,856 --> 01:28:26,624
Which was written

2199
01:28:26,880 --> 01:28:28,160
To ban conversion therapy

2200
01:28:29,184 --> 01:28:31,744
A segment about the bail on one America News Network

2201
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:33,792
Place that employs jakpa Staubach

2202
01:28:34,048 --> 01:28:37,888
Argued that this was going to make the Bible hate speech and Outlaw the sale of the Bible

2203
01:28:38,400 --> 01:28:40,192
From there it became a hot talking point with

2204
01:28:40,448 --> 01:28:41,472
The evangelico crowd

2205
01:28:41,728 --> 01:28:44,288
Confirming their worst fears about the state trying to oppress them

2206
01:28:45,056 --> 01:28:51,200
Conversion therapy has been shown not to achieve the desired goal which is a phrasing that I'm uncomfortable with but honestly I don't know

2207
01:28:51,456 --> 01:28:52,992
Know how to express that point any other way

2208
01:28:53,504 --> 01:28:57,600
These people believe that they're able to change people's fundamental Identity or

2209
01:28:57,856 --> 01:29:00,416
Or persuasion are sexual orientation

2210
01:29:00,672 --> 01:29:02,720
But it doesn't achieve that goal

2211
01:29:03,232 --> 01:29:05,536
Nope. I hate I hate

2212
01:29:05,792 --> 01:29:07,584
I hate that I can't find a better way to say that

2213
01:29:08,096 --> 01:29:09,888
Because even the phrasing

2214
01:29:10,656 --> 01:29:11,936
Imply that there is a goal

2215
01:29:15,264 --> 01:29:16,544
It's a brutal practice

2216
01:29:16,800 --> 01:29:20,128
That often involves trying to attach negative stimuli like

2217
01:29:20,384 --> 01:29:24,736
Nauseate shanor electric shocks with homosexual thoughts or feelings

2218
01:29:25,248 --> 01:29:27,552
And I don't understand what the difference is between that

2219
01:29:27,808 --> 01:29:28,576
And like you said torture

2220
01:29:28,832 --> 01:29:30,112
Yeah that's good

2221
01:29:30,368 --> 01:29:31,648
If you read those things

2222
01:29:32,416 --> 01:29:33,440
Oh that's A Clockwork Orange

2223
01:29:33,696 --> 01:29:36,768
Describing A Clockwork Orange and that's not always the case

2224
01:29:37,792 --> 01:29:38,304
But it does

2225
01:29:38,816 --> 01:29:41,120
Enough very well worth

2226
01:29:41,376 --> 01:29:42,400
Mention

2227
01:29:43,168 --> 01:29:46,240
A recent study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association

2228
01:29:46,496 --> 01:29:48,288
Lynx quotes of your psychological

2229
01:29:48,544 --> 01:29:49,568
Distressed

2230
01:29:49,824 --> 01:29:50,336
Made it subject

2231
01:29:50,592 --> 01:29:51,360
People took

2232
01:29:51,616 --> 01:29:52,128
Conversion therapy

2233
01:29:52,896 --> 01:29:54,688
The co-author of that study found the quote

2234
01:29:54,944 --> 01:29:58,016
People who are exposed to conversion efforts any time in their lives

2235
01:29:58,272 --> 01:30:04,416
Have more than double the odds of attempted suicide compared to those who have never experienced ever by professionals to convert their

2236
01:30:04,672 --> 01:30:05,184
Gender identity

2237
01:30:05,696 --> 01:30:08,512
Study also found that age is really important

2238
01:30:09,024 --> 01:30:11,328
And the people who are subjected to these things

2239
01:30:11,584 --> 01:30:12,608
Even earlier in life

2240
01:30:12,864 --> 01:30:13,632
Have a four-time

2241
01:30:13,888 --> 01:30:14,912
Times higher rate of attempt

2242
01:30:15,168 --> 01:30:15,680
Suicide

2243
01:30:15,936 --> 01:30:16,960
Very serious issue

2244
01:30:17,984 --> 01:30:22,336
Conversion therapy as applied to things like gender identity or sexual orientation or barbaric

2245
01:30:22,592 --> 01:30:23,104
Humanizing

2246
01:30:23,360 --> 01:30:25,920
An absolutely cause severe problems for the people

2247
01:30:26,176 --> 01:30:26,688
Subjected to those

2248
01:30:27,712 --> 01:30:32,064
But Christian fundamentalists like policy conversion therapy is just part of their religious out

2249
01:30:32,832 --> 01:30:34,624
It's what the Bible would tell her to do

2250
01:30:34,880 --> 01:30:37,440
So if California is Banning conversion therapy

2251
01:30:37,696 --> 01:30:38,720
Then that's actually

2252
01:30:38,976 --> 01:30:40,000
California banning

2253
01:30:40,256 --> 01:30:41,792
Her following the Bible

2254
01:30:42,560 --> 01:30:44,096
This is extremist s***

2255
01:30:44,608 --> 01:30:46,912
She may have a soft lilt to her voice

2256
01:30:47,168 --> 01:30:48,448
She may not be saying that she wants

2257
01:30:48,704 --> 01:30:51,008
Kill people who don't fit her mold of religious beliefs

2258
01:30:51,264 --> 01:30:53,056
Apologize not give a f***

2259
01:30:53,312 --> 01:30:54,592
About living in a free Society

2260
01:30:55,360 --> 01:30:56,128
She knows that she

2261
01:30:56,384 --> 01:30:59,200
Can't really make the argument that she wants to make in reality

2262
01:30:59,712 --> 01:31:00,480
She can't say

2263
01:31:00,736 --> 01:31:01,504
I want lgbtq

2264
01:31:01,760 --> 01:31:02,272
Atq youths

2265
01:31:02,528 --> 01:31:07,136
Subjected to brutal therapies that don't work to make them more likely and make them more likely to kill themselves

2266
01:31:07,392 --> 01:31:07,904
Because I see

2267
01:31:08,160 --> 01:31:09,184
I think their identities are wrong

2268
01:31:09,696 --> 01:31:12,256
She knows that argument doesn't play in a free Society

2269
01:31:12,768 --> 01:31:13,280
Socialize

2270
01:31:13,792 --> 01:31:14,816
To move the goalposts

2271
01:31:15,072 --> 01:31:16,864
Turns it into an argument with California

2272
01:31:17,120 --> 01:31:18,144
Trying to outlaw the Bible

2273
01:31:18,656 --> 01:31:20,704
Because that achieves the same end result of

2274
01:31:20,960 --> 01:31:22,752
Put anchor pushing the radical extremists

2275
01:31:23,008 --> 01:31:24,288
And more importantly

2276
01:31:24,800 --> 01:31:25,568
Keeps the sweet donation

2277
01:31:25,824 --> 01:31:26,336
It's coming in

2278
01:31:27,104 --> 01:31:30,688
You can see how this easily could like this exact same logic could be

2279
01:31:30,944 --> 01:31:33,248
Be used by anybody who wants to push some

2280
01:31:33,504 --> 01:31:34,528
Form of religious

2281
01:31:35,040 --> 01:31:37,088
Yeah I mean switch it out with

2282
01:31:37,344 --> 01:31:38,112
Female

2283
01:31:42,720 --> 01:31:44,768
Like just stay in the realm of the Bible

2284
01:31:45,024 --> 01:31:48,352
Like you could say we should Stone adulterers

2285
01:31:49,120 --> 01:31:54,240
California passes a law that you can't text Outlaw they're trying to outlaw the Bible

2286
01:31:54,496 --> 01:31:55,776
Yeah I mean

2287
01:31:56,032 --> 01:31:58,848
The fundamental logic that's being used

2288
01:31:59,616 --> 01:32:00,384
Is sewed

2289
01:32:00,640 --> 01:32:01,152
Deeply

2290
01:32:02,176 --> 01:32:03,968
Disturbing

2291
01:32:05,504 --> 01:32:06,784
I just

2292
01:32:07,040 --> 01:32:08,064
I can't handle stuff like

2293
01:32:09,344 --> 01:32:11,136
It's missing the forest for the trees

2294
01:32:11,392 --> 01:32:12,416
And the forest

2295
01:32:12,672 --> 01:32:13,184
Is

2296
01:32:14,976 --> 01:32:15,488
Deep

2297
01:32:15,744 --> 01:32:16,768
Abuse

2298
01:32:17,024 --> 01:32:20,864
People who don't fit your mold of what you're the world you want to live in it

2299
01:32:21,120 --> 01:32:22,400
Well I mean the

2300
01:32:22,656 --> 01:32:24,448
Basically the they're trying

2301
01:32:24,704 --> 01:32:25,216
To save it

2302
01:32:25,472 --> 01:32:26,496
Torture is religious

2303
01:32:28,544 --> 01:32:32,384
I guess if that's the argument that we're having

2304
01:32:32,640 --> 01:32:36,736
That's what we should be talking about is it okay for torture to be part of your religion

2305
01:32:36,992 --> 01:32:40,064
Where do you come down

2306
01:32:40,320 --> 01:32:41,344
With you okay

2307
01:32:41,600 --> 01:32:43,648
I don't know how much this could be

2308
01:32:43,904 --> 01:32:44,928
Kind of a slippery slope

2309
01:32:45,184 --> 01:32:45,696
B

2310
01:32:46,208 --> 01:32:46,976
I don't see it being

2311
01:32:47,232 --> 01:32:48,256
Too far of a leaf

2312
01:32:48,512 --> 01:32:49,280
For her to then

2313
01:32:49,536 --> 01:32:51,584
Like apply this outside of just

2314
01:32:51,840 --> 01:32:52,352
You know

2315
01:32:52,864 --> 01:32:53,376
Lgbtq

2316
01:32:53,632 --> 01:32:55,168
Tfue related

2317
01:32:56,448 --> 01:32:57,984
Conversion therapy

2318
01:32:58,240 --> 01:32:59,520
Type laws like

2319
01:32:59,776 --> 01:33:00,288
How

2320
01:33:00,544 --> 01:33:01,568
Big leap is it

2321
01:33:01,824 --> 01:33:03,104
Vertu be like well

2322
01:33:03,872 --> 01:33:04,384
Muslims

2323
01:33:04,896 --> 01:33:06,944
Who don't want to be Christian

2324
01:33:07,200 --> 01:33:11,296
The Bible says go make Fishers of Men spread the gospel like

2325
01:33:11,808 --> 01:33:13,088
Putting people into

2326
01:33:13,856 --> 01:33:14,368
Or

2327
01:33:14,624 --> 01:33:15,904
Centers who don't

2328
01:33:16,416 --> 01:33:18,464
Convert to Christianity

2329
01:33:18,720 --> 01:33:22,048
I love that undergo conversion if you want

2330
01:33:22,304 --> 01:33:22,816
To do that

2331
01:33:23,072 --> 01:33:24,096
To let's say Muslim

2332
01:33:25,120 --> 01:33:26,400
And someone says you can't

2333
01:33:26,656 --> 01:33:32,800
You're ruining my religious freedom. It's outlawed

2334
01:33:33,056 --> 01:33:34,848
People whenever they hear the word Allah

2335
01:33:35,104 --> 01:33:37,152
Fine you hate religion then

2336
01:33:37,408 --> 01:33:38,688
I understand that that is

2337
01:33:38,944 --> 01:33:41,248
An extension of this logic

2338
01:33:41,504 --> 01:33:42,016
Maybe

2339
01:33:42,272 --> 01:33:45,088
Maybe too far of a leap but

2340
01:33:45,344 --> 01:33:47,904
It it does follow from the

2341
01:33:48,160 --> 01:33:49,440
Precept she's putting forth

2342
01:33:49,696 --> 01:33:54,560
That that would be considered somehow a Banning of the Bible and saying that their Bible is hates

2343
01:33:55,072 --> 01:33:56,352
Yeah it is it's nonsense

2344
01:33:56,608 --> 01:33:57,376
It's

2345
01:33:58,912 --> 01:33:59,424
It's

2346
01:34:00,192 --> 01:34:01,984
What should be is the draconian

2347
01:34:02,240 --> 01:34:06,080
Gay conversion therapy should be too far out there to make as a slipper

2348
01:34:06,336 --> 01:34:06,848
Not

2349
01:34:07,872 --> 01:34:08,896
Pull on genocide

2350
01:34:09,152 --> 01:34:09,664
Is too far out

2351
01:34:12,224 --> 01:34:14,016
His work is bigger than a

2352
01:34:15,296 --> 01:34:16,064
Jared Taylor

2353
01:34:17,088 --> 01:34:17,856
Yeah

2354
01:34:18,112 --> 01:34:18,880
An Impala

2355
01:34:19,136 --> 01:34:19,648
Is just

2356
01:34:19,904 --> 01:34:21,440
Actively trying to get people to say

2357
01:34:22,464 --> 01:34:22,976
Doing this

2358
01:34:23,232 --> 01:34:29,120
Is bigger than me and it's so much bigger than made it is which is why right now you better write that PO box

2359
01:34:29,376 --> 01:34:32,448
And not just get the book and not just

2360
01:34:32,704 --> 01:34:38,848
Get this which is exclusive to Jim and Lori not just send in 35 but you need to send in 3,500.

2361
01:34:39,360 --> 01:34:45,504
You need to send in 35,000 you need to send in that hundred-thousand-dollar check because you know God has blessed

2362
01:34:46,016 --> 01:34:49,856
You know what a blessing this ministry and now there's a launching of a network

2363
01:34:50,112 --> 01:34:55,232
I'm telling you in God has mandated to in the world and their right mind

2364
01:34:55,488 --> 01:34:58,304
Would build a network at 80 years old

2365
01:34:58,560 --> 01:35:04,704
No one unless they had a Chihuahua or

2366
01:35:04,960 --> 01:35:09,568
Yeah I guess so I mean he's old so you can't be slamming

2367
01:35:10,080 --> 01:35:10,848
He's a liar

2368
01:35:11,104 --> 01:35:13,408
I like that sort of like

2369
01:35:13,920 --> 01:35:14,688
The argument

2370
01:35:14,944 --> 01:35:19,040
Well he's going to be dead so why does he need money

2371
01:35:19,296 --> 01:35:20,064
Okay

2372
01:35:20,320 --> 01:35:20,832
Alright

2373
01:35:21,088 --> 01:35:22,112
That works cool

2374
01:35:22,368 --> 01:35:28,512
Weapon Applause line so we heard it's a very

2375
01:35:29,024 --> 01:35:29,792
It's very much

2376
01:35:30,048 --> 01:35:33,376
Kind of been couched in do you like there is something to gain by giving him

2377
01:35:33,888 --> 01:35:34,656
Which is

2378
01:35:35,168 --> 01:35:37,984
You know manipulative I still think it's wrong but at least it's

2379
01:35:38,240 --> 01:35:40,544
Hey like hey you want to support the ministry

2380
01:35:40,800 --> 01:35:43,872
So you should give him $35,000

2381
01:35:44,128 --> 01:35:45,152
$100,000

2382
01:35:46,432 --> 01:35:46,944
In his next

2383
01:35:47,200 --> 01:35:48,224
And last clip

2384
01:35:48,992 --> 01:35:50,272
I think we're getting into the stick

2385
01:35:50,784 --> 01:35:52,832
You know that did the threatening stick

2386
01:35:53,344 --> 01:35:54,880
Where it is changes

2387
01:35:55,136 --> 01:35:57,184
Words now if you don't give him money

2388
01:35:57,696 --> 01:36:03,072
Negative things play and you and your son might be getting ready

2389
01:36:03,328 --> 01:36:04,096
To eat your last

2390
01:36:04,352 --> 01:36:10,496
Cake and your Crews might be failing and your barrel of meal might be failing but I'm telling you if you do not write that PO

2391
01:36:10,752 --> 01:36:16,896
PO box and you do not call that toll-free number and you do not become a Ministry of sustained or you will never see sustainment in

2392
01:36:17,152 --> 01:36:23,296
In your life and your dream will die your call will die because God sets it up that way that what you may

2393
01:36:23,552 --> 01:36:29,696
Make happen for this ministry and is used to stain it. Says your cruise is not going to fail your bear was not going to fail

2394
01:36:29,952 --> 01:36:35,328
Your son might die but he's going to be resurrected because the enemies going to come in but I'm going to cause life

2395
01:36:35,584 --> 01:36:36,608
Sustaining to come to you

2396
01:36:36,864 --> 01:36:40,448
I'm going to cause your life to be sustained your son's life to be sustained

2397
01:36:40,704 --> 01:36:46,848
Your money to be sustained your massages. The saying your business to be sustained because you are doing what I have

2398
01:36:47,104 --> 01:36:48,640
I've said to do and I am telling you

2399
01:36:48,896 --> 01:36:51,456
You are so right on right now because we know

2400
01:36:51,712 --> 01:36:53,504
I hate to call this an interest

2401
01:36:54,528 --> 01:37:00,672
But we know in the industry so straightforward you probably never going to have me back

2402
01:37:04,256 --> 01:37:09,888
They want to stop they want to keep charging us more and more what we want to do get the gospel

2403
01:37:10,144 --> 01:37:12,448
We know that we want to preach

2404
01:37:12,704 --> 01:37:13,984
Uncompromised

2405
01:37:14,240 --> 01:37:20,128
We know that they are closing that window Tighter and Tighter on us and if we don't launch our own network

2406
01:37:20,384 --> 01:37:24,992
That we have the ability through technology to control our voice

2407
01:37:25,248 --> 01:37:27,296
A come together as the body of Christ

2408
01:37:27,552 --> 01:37:30,624
Then I'm telling you they are trying to shut down the word of God

2409
01:37:31,136 --> 01:37:33,952
They're trying to shut it down

2410
01:37:34,208 --> 01:37:38,816
Do you know like if you don't give Jim this money then nothing that you want is ever going to

2411
01:37:39,072 --> 01:37:39,840
To come to pass

2412
01:37:40,864 --> 01:37:43,936
It's so gross and if you do give him this money your kid might

2413
01:37:44,192 --> 01:37:46,752
Might still die but he's going to come back and have him buddy

2414
01:37:47,264 --> 01:37:50,848
Department of Treasury One More Time come on

2415
01:37:51,616 --> 01:37:52,128
2 gross things

2416
01:37:56,224 --> 01:38:02,368
The treasury Department in heaven will recognize it on The Ledger and they'll pay for whatever restorative Health Care is made

2417
01:38:02,624 --> 01:38:04,928
Better if he was good or bad

2418
01:38:05,184 --> 01:38:05,952
They're going to pay for

2419
01:38:06,208 --> 01:38:12,352
Medicare for all in heaven indulgences are great I think everybody saw that

2420
01:38:12,608 --> 01:38:13,632
That worked with the Catholic Church

2421
01:38:13,888 --> 01:38:14,656
And it was

2422
01:38:15,680 --> 01:38:16,448
This is gross

2423
01:38:16,960 --> 01:38:17,728
Like it's just

2424
01:38:18,240 --> 01:38:20,288
Disgusting levels of

2425
01:38:20,544 --> 01:38:21,312
Cynical

2426
01:38:21,824 --> 01:38:22,336
Money

2427
01:38:22,592 --> 01:38:23,360
Grabbing death

2428
01:38:23,616 --> 01:38:26,688
It's going on here on this show like whether it's through

2429
01:38:26,944 --> 01:38:27,968
Trying to get her book

2430
01:38:28,224 --> 01:38:31,808
Sold me know that you're Baker's already talked about a by the ton of people's books

2431
01:38:32,064 --> 01:38:35,648
You've already made the money call Pamela

2432
01:38:36,160 --> 01:38:36,928
So you know

2433
01:38:37,440 --> 01:38:38,720
You're trying to sell this book

2434
01:38:38,976 --> 01:38:42,304
And then trying to get hundred-thousand $10,000 donation

2435
01:38:42,816 --> 01:38:46,656
To build his f****** Studios we could do a 24-hour prophecy Network

2436
01:38:47,424 --> 01:38:48,192
Just it's

2437
01:38:48,960 --> 01:38:50,496
And the way that he described the problem

2438
01:38:51,008 --> 01:38:51,520
Vertu's like

2439
01:38:51,776 --> 01:38:54,592
There's going to be healing there you see who's pitching the TV show

2440
01:38:54,848 --> 01:38:56,640
We're going to have a healing

2441
01:38:56,896 --> 01:39:02,016
I know that's hot on YouTube

2442
01:39:03,040 --> 01:39:04,064
Yeah it like

2443
01:39:04,576 --> 01:39:05,856
To put a button on the

2444
01:39:06,368 --> 01:39:07,392
I mean I know that

2445
01:39:07,904 --> 01:39:10,208
Baby you've brought it up a number of times but like

2446
01:39:10,720 --> 01:39:12,512
I find you so immensely boring

2447
01:39:12,768 --> 01:39:13,536
It's a plant

2448
01:39:13,792 --> 01:39:16,352
Parent cash-grab it's disgusting

2449
01:39:16,864 --> 01:39:18,912
What he's doing to people is abusive

2450
01:39:19,168 --> 01:39:20,960
And I resent it entirely

2451
01:39:21,472 --> 01:39:22,752
Brahma humans

2452
01:39:23,008 --> 01:39:27,872
Point and from a person who doesn't believe that religion is intrinsically evil

2453
01:39:28,640 --> 01:39:30,944
From both of those two endpoints I find this

2454
01:39:31,200 --> 01:39:31,712
Tubi

2455
01:39:31,968 --> 01:39:32,992
The works

2456
01:39:33,248 --> 01:39:38,112
But it's also super boring and I probably wouldn't even cover this episode where he's trying to raise money for his

2457
01:39:38,368 --> 01:39:40,160
New film studio

2458
01:39:40,416 --> 01:39:43,232
If his guest didn't work in the White House

2459
01:39:44,256 --> 01:39:46,816
Like this is the connection between the

2460
01:39:47,072 --> 01:39:48,352
This world is so explicit

2461
01:39:48,864 --> 01:39:50,400
The connection here is Boracay

2462
01:39:50,656 --> 01:39:51,680
Explicit then Alex

2463
01:39:56,032 --> 01:39:57,824
So

2464
01:39:58,080 --> 01:40:00,128
He's guy in the white house has Miller

2465
01:40:00,384 --> 01:40:03,456
Like Steve Miller's not coming on the Infowars

2466
01:40:08,576 --> 01:40:11,648
I don't even know the words to I'm speaking in tongues

2467
01:40:11,904 --> 01:40:14,976
The word I want to use about this

2468
01:40:15,488 --> 01:40:18,560
So if you would like to hear Dan speak in tongues more please

2469
01:40:18,816 --> 01:40:24,448
Donate thousands upon thousands of dollars to our new Foundation we're going to do a 24/7

2470
01:40:24,704 --> 01:40:30,848
Where to call a Tongan with Dan I think we should change it just going to be rolling ours

2471
01:40:31,104 --> 01:40:32,896
Pictures of the whole 24 hours

2472
01:40:33,408 --> 01:40:35,200
Endurance tongue roll

2473
01:40:36,480 --> 01:40:40,576
I don't I don't like it that I don't know the word but this is the strongest possible terms

2474
01:40:40,832 --> 01:40:41,344
I

2475
01:40:43,136 --> 01:40:43,904
Vacaville

2476
01:40:45,440 --> 01:40:46,720
It is it really is like

2477
01:40:46,976 --> 01:40:48,768
Oh man there is no bottom

2478
01:40:49,024 --> 01:40:55,168
Isn't a bottom there might be a bottom but it'd be interesting to know what it is I think

2479
01:40:56,448 --> 01:41:02,080
I think the bottom for people like this like a gym or Apollo or a Lori is just like

2480
01:41:03,104 --> 01:41:06,944
Being allowed to run all scams they want to run

2481
01:41:07,200 --> 01:41:07,968
That's the bottom

2482
01:41:08,480 --> 01:41:08,992
What

2483
01:41:09,504 --> 01:41:10,528
Removing any

2484
01:41:10,784 --> 01:41:11,552
Anything

2485
01:41:11,808 --> 01:41:14,112
Gets in the way of them fleecing

2486
01:41:14,624 --> 01:41:16,928
Gullible and vulnerable people

2487
01:41:17,184 --> 01:41:17,952
Is the bottom

2488
01:41:18,208 --> 01:41:21,536
Yeah I don't think they have any interest in going much further beneath that

2489
01:41:22,048 --> 01:41:24,608
Like I don't I don't know if these people are ideologues

2490
01:41:25,120 --> 01:41:31,008
They might be they might be but I think that their ideology is far more about the scam right is

2491
01:41:31,264 --> 01:41:33,056
About extra look like social issue

2492
01:41:33,568 --> 01:41:34,592
Right now granted

2493
01:41:35,104 --> 01:41:36,128
In pursuing

2494
01:41:36,384 --> 01:41:38,944
Pursuing their scam

2495
01:41:39,200 --> 01:41:44,576
They end up hurting a lot of people in political ways I mean a lot of these people also

2496
01:41:44,832 --> 01:41:46,112
Go insane

2497
01:41:46,368 --> 01:41:47,648
And start to believe there

2498
01:41:48,672 --> 01:41:49,184
If they didn't

2499
01:41:49,440 --> 01:41:49,952
At the beginning

2500
01:41:50,464 --> 01:41:55,584
You mean people like Jim or the people like they're listening

2501
01:41:55,840 --> 01:41:57,632
Does L Type Stone

2502
01:41:57,888 --> 01:41:58,912
Don't usually

2503
01:41:59,424 --> 01:41:59,936
Have

2504
01:42:00,448 --> 01:42:00,960
As they

2505
01:42:01,472 --> 01:42:01,984
As they continued

2506
01:42:02,752 --> 01:42:06,080
Popularity and you can see a lack of restraint even involve the way that she

2507
01:42:06,336 --> 01:42:06,848
These long

2508
01:42:08,384 --> 01:42:08,896
Diatribe

2509
01:42:09,664 --> 01:42:11,456
I wouldn't be too surprised even issues like on

2510
01:42:12,224 --> 01:42:13,504
Atwoods

2511
01:42:16,576 --> 01:42:18,880
Anyway I find every time

2512
01:42:19,136 --> 01:42:21,184
I take a look at Jim Bakker to either be

2513
01:42:21,696 --> 01:42:22,720
So bored as

2514
01:42:22,976 --> 01:42:24,512
To just be a waste of my time

2515
01:42:24,768 --> 01:42:27,328
Or so just disgusted by what I see

2516
01:42:27,840 --> 01:42:29,120
That this is one of them

2517
01:42:29,376 --> 01:42:32,192
This is this is one of the ladder types so

2518
01:42:33,216 --> 01:42:34,752
Achievement of sorts

2519
01:42:35,008 --> 01:42:36,032
It is impressive

2520
01:42:36,288 --> 01:42:38,592
To think that I listen to Alex Jones

2521
01:42:39,360 --> 01:42:44,224
Bentley and this is still like it raises the needle a little baby

2522
01:42:44,480 --> 01:42:48,320
It's a dubious distinction that Jim and Laura and Lori and Pollock

2523
01:42:48,576 --> 01:42:52,160
Can have the even in my unshockable state

2524
01:42:53,440 --> 01:42:55,488
Jaded mystery listening to Alex Jones

2525
01:42:56,256 --> 01:42:58,048
You have disgusted

2526
01:42:58,304 --> 01:42:59,840
Congratulations

2527
01:43:00,352 --> 01:43:00,864
A wolf

2528
01:43:01,120 --> 01:43:01,888
BoBoiBoy

2529
