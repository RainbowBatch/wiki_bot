1
00:00:04,096 --> 00:00:10,240
Alexandra Thurston color with huge fan I love your work

2
00:00:10,496 --> 00:00:14,080
Beverages and talk a little bit

3
00:00:14,336 --> 00:00:16,384
About Alex Jones

4
00:00:19,712 --> 00:00:22,016
Most work you ever had to do to get a bottle

5
00:00:24,832 --> 00:00:26,624
Get out of scrapes

6
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:36,096
I don't know I've gone to the store to buy a bottle of wine

7
00:00:36,352 --> 00:00:39,680
I have to be in this question

8
00:00:39,936 --> 00:00:41,984
What's

9
00:00:42,496 --> 00:00:43,264
Farthest you've gone

10
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,080
To get alcohol what is like when you have you been in this

11
00:00:46,336 --> 00:00:49,152
Hundreds of times when I've liked walked

12
00:00:49,408 --> 00:00:50,176
Hours

13
00:00:50,432 --> 00:00:53,504
And then but it's only because I never found it

14
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:58,368
Especially around the area we are in uptown Chicago

15
00:00:58,624 --> 00:01:04,768
There's so many places that close super early so you have this idea that if you just go five more blocks you find someplace

16
00:01:05,024 --> 00:01:06,816
I've done that a number of times

17
00:01:07,328 --> 00:01:08,096
In the past few years

18
00:01:08,352 --> 00:01:10,144
Just walking around for like an hour and a half

19
00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:11,936
I got to give up

20
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:22,944
Where is Lackey High School

21
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,016
I I found booze pretty easily when I thought they started

22
00:01:27,808 --> 00:01:30,112
Just go and people rarely apartment

23
00:01:31,904 --> 00:01:34,464
An issue and I started hanging out at the gutter Punk bar

24
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,840
I worked at a gas station

25
00:01:40,096 --> 00:01:44,704
My work are they all the food

26
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:48,544
Never really a problem

27
00:01:49,056 --> 00:01:51,616
Beard is a cheat code to a

28
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:54,688
Yeah since you were nine you've been 21

29
00:01:54,944 --> 00:01:57,760
Yeah kind of I mean I didn't start drinking until

30
00:01:58,528 --> 00:01:59,040
I don't know

31
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:01,856
Baby 16:7

32
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:08,256
No no but I I didn't

33
00:02:08,768 --> 00:02:12,608
Write me a little while to get to the point

34
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:15,424
Sorted out

35
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:16,448
Full force

36
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,752
Like I've the first time I drank

37
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:19,776
Because

38
00:02:20,032 --> 00:02:20,800
One of my friends

39
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:23,872
And this is the links that we had to go to Bowie

40
00:02:24,128 --> 00:02:28,992
If I want to tell the story

41
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:32,064
I have to go I have to I had to go a long way to find it

42
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,088
Pacific bottle of wine

43
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:37,440
But this is

44
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:38,720
Childhood as far as buying

45
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:42,048
One of my friends still

46
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:42,816
Jack

47
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:45,888
From the rec center

48
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:50,240
Town of the rec center have Jack Daniels

49
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:52,032
Is it need to be

50
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:53,568
How did he know

51
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:56,384
How did he steal first

52
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,944
The filing cabinet

53
00:03:02,528 --> 00:03:04,320
Snitched on the bottle

54
00:03:04,576 --> 00:03:05,344
Alright

55
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:10,976
We just essentially drinks

56
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:15,584
So my first time drinking like in Earnest was at a park

57
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:16,864
Of course everybody's

58
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,656
Usually when you're that age to go to a park

59
00:03:18,912 --> 00:03:19,936
Mine was an addict but okay

60
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:24,800
I was hanging out with my friend from Mike a life group

61
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:34,784
Right right we would sort of us end of the small group

62
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,320
Yeah and Aaron

63
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:37,600
Parents liquor cabinet

64
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:39,136
And they had

65
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:46,304
We took a bottle of wine bottle red wine a bottle of peppermint schnapps and we went to the park

66
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:52,704
We're drinking because we were so young and dumb we decided to mix them together

67
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:59,104
Done with that remix them together

68
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,640
Disgusting

69
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:02,432
Make matters worse

70
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:07,808
Freezing out

71
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:15,488
In the middle of a cold park with the wine and schnapps

72
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:21,887
Rent-A-Center

73
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:24,959
Find it he stole it

74
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:27,519
As he told

75
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:29,567
ICICI

76
00:04:30,591 --> 00:04:31,615
To get not the actual drink

77
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:33,407
God I hate you

78
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:34,431
Fine

79
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:35,711
You know what I love and

80
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:43,903
People who are supporting the show

81
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:44,927
First of all

82
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:47,487

83
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:49,535

Nesquik

89
00:04:59,263 --> 00:05:05,407
How much further are we going to go no further

90
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:13,855

91
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:21,023

96
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:45,343
Jesus Christ

Thank you so much April

98
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:54,047
Appreciate it

99
00:05:56,351 --> 00:05:57,119
Today's business

100
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:59,167
I think it is important for us to take a little second

101
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:01,215
To give a special message

102
00:06:01,727 --> 00:06:03,519
Out there too

103
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:04,543
Who's that

104
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:06,079
Zapped

105
00:06:06,591 --> 00:06:10,687
Because out there driving around believe this morning from what I hear

106
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:15,039
Celebrating a birthday

107
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:21,695
What's the farthest you ever going to get into

108
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:24,255
6 miles

109
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:34,751
Thank you so much for listening to the show happy birthday to you

110
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:39,359
Least let us the message we all wish you

111
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:45,759
Public information

112
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:52,159
Like we have a weird

113
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:04,959
Amy Jordan the only thing we can do is

114
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:07,775
Sing Happy Birthday

115
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:09,055
Cool.

116
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:15,455
Almond eyes

117
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:23,647
Happy birthday

118
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:29,023
Happy birthday hope you have a great one

119
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:34,655
Jordan

120
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:40,543
What's today's business

121
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:43,359
Wacky Wednesday

122
00:07:43,615 --> 00:07:47,455
Wild Wednesday or weird

123
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:51,807
Because sometimes it's not all that wacky are we married to the alliteration

124
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:55,391
Can we just call it but you're really like it out of the ordinary

125
00:07:55,647 --> 00:08:01,535
That's a little bit clunky

126
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:11,519
You don't know shitt I was almost in the Honolulu police choir

127
00:08:11,775 --> 00:08:13,311
Music teacher I've been involved

128
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:14,591
Music

129
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:16,127
Cooper Suites

130
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:17,663
That's right

131
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:18,687
Musical theater

132
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,479
Cool the greatest of Art Club

133
00:08:20,735 --> 00:08:21,759
I was in a musical

134
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:27,903
Merced Junior High Middle School

135
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:34,303
Breeders ago in Community Theater don't want to talk about it

136
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:46,079
Just turned out to be a heavy Wednesday apparently

137
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:55,295
Certain additional episode a lot of stuff about Project Camelot

138
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:59,647
Obviously the Reverend batting coach Dave

139
00:09:00,671 --> 00:09:06,047
Jim Bakker I'll certainly keep an eye on him four times we can talk about him

140
00:09:06,303 --> 00:09:08,095
Some people about stuff that's

141
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:09,887
Might fit into that fold and

142
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:11,423
Keep my eyes open

143
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:12,959
Looking for possibilities.

144
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:14,239
But also like I said

145
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:16,543
I think it is also a perfect place for us to

146
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:21,407
Fulfill time travel request request

147
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:26,271
And honoring of the wish of one George Soros Junior

148
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:28,319
Why do you point

149
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:29,599
Because

150
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:31,135
Is your Doctor Who

151
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:34,975
And that means today is Wednesday I like it

152
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:41,375
Thank you very much

153
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:42,399
Duration everything

154
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:47,263
I have no idea

155
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:48,543
It absolutely not

156
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:49,311
Vander Soros

157
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:51,359
Anyone related to Soros

158
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:54,431
I'm pretty sure I'm telling you the Kennedys

159
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:55,967
Head one of their kids

160
00:09:56,991 --> 00:10:00,063
Right I got an update on that

161
00:10:00,319 --> 00:10:06,463
We laughed about that

162
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:14,143
George Soros Junior got in touch with me

163
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:15,167
Fanza

164
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:16,959
Wanted to know about

165
00:10:17,215 --> 00:10:19,263
What Alex Jones talked about

166
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:20,799
The Ebola outbreak

167
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:22,335
In 2014

168
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:30,015
Which

169
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:34,623
You are

170
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:40,255
You're in a mood

171
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:43,839
Unnecessary response

172
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:45,887
Outbreak

173
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:48,447
Somebody

174
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:55,103
Outbreaks

175
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:55,871
West Africa

176
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:58,431
Largely

177
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:05,599
Eventually spread to Sierra Leone in Liberia

178
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:06,623
Lie.

179
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:08,671
I was particularly hit hard

180
00:11:09,183 --> 00:11:10,719
Is ended up getting taken

181
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:13,791
Kantaros and then getting worse

182
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:17,119
Baby got worse how you judge that

183
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:23,519
Sierra Leone in Liberia were declared free of Ebola and then work 8

184
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:25,055
Intel 2016

185
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:27,871
All of it ended

186
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:28,639
Internet

187
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:29,919
Right

188
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:33,759
Community

189
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:35,551
People that made a lot of money

190
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:41,439
Out of the CIA was on the rise.

191
00:11:42,207 --> 00:11:46,815
McNabb 2014 particularly

192
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:49,375
Pretty serious

193
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:51,167
In September

194
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:54,239
14

195
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:57,311
2014 is when things got to be like

196
00:11:58,591 --> 00:11:59,615
Getting outside

197
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:03,455
And there was a case in the United

198
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:05,503
The first case

199
00:12:06,783 --> 00:12:07,295
Dallas

200
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:08,319
Actually

201
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:11,647
On September 30th

202
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:12,415
2014

203
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:16,255
Because George Soros Junior gave me such vague

204
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:17,535
I don't be missed judgemental

205
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:20,095
Give me a vague idea of where to go to

206
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:21,887
I was like okay

207
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:24,447
The first case is in Texas

208
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:31,359
Freak out about that but it still got to be like

209
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:33,663
On the 30th

210
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:35,455
I'm going to October 1st

211
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:40,063
F****** freak Out Show

212
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:42,111
Right

213
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:44,159
Is almost always the case

214
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:46,463
No

215
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:51,071
This is weird Trend that I've noticed from these time travel request the people make

216
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:54,655
Alex is almost never in studio in big news break

217
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:59,007
Whatever the pope resigned he was on vacation and David night with hosting

218
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:03,359
When the Ebola outbreak happened in case in Texas

219
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:05,663
He's on vacation to Paul Joseph Watson toast

220
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:10,271
So I found the first episode where Alex

221
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:15,903
Back from vacation after there was a case in the United States in Texas

222
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:17,439
Of someone with Ebola

223
00:13:17,695 --> 00:13:19,999
Happens to be October 5th

224
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:21,279
2014

225
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:24,351
That is absolutely going over today

226
00:13:24,607 --> 00:13:25,375
Specifics of

227
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:26,911
The actual outbreak

228
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:28,703
That's stop along the way

229
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:30,239
But it is actually

230
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:31,519
Sing a lot of this

231
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:33,823
Mangle on it

232
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:35,871
Try to predict both of them

233
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:37,663
There's a lot to learn along the way to

234
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:41,503
I feel like this is also one of

235
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:43,807
Time travel episode Trends where it's like

236
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:46,367
Whatever it was that you are asking

237
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:49,439
For the goddess to the time-travel

238
00:13:49,695 --> 00:13:52,511
We wind up talking about everything but that

239
00:13:56,095 --> 00:14:02,239
Play yeah yeah

240
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:07,103
It is it still out

241
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:13,503
Because he's recharged from vacation

242
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:16,319
And then another piece of my heart

243
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:20,159
Could be another part of it might be that this is also a Sunday

244
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:23,487
October 5th is a Sunday show

245
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:24,511
Feels like pressure

246
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:27,071
His career that was still

247
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:29,375
Much more of a lucrative things

248
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:34,751
Tokyo

249
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:41,151
Genesis Communications

250
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:43,455
I'll tell you why I chose October

251
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:48,063
2014

252
00:14:48,319 --> 00:14:49,087
Emporium

253
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:50,879
I was going to try and be like

254
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:51,903
Hey here's

255
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:55,231
Do you know why it is

256
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:05,471
That could have happened in another universe is how this episode start

257
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:08,799
But in this universe that starts with us playing out of context dropped

258
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:16,735
It's

259
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:20,831
Okay

260
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:24,415
It's so crazy it's so crazy to me

261
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:25,183
He does

262
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:26,207
These things with like

263
00:15:26,463 --> 00:15:26,975
Masculine

264
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:29,279
He has it from both sides

265
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:31,071
Like you want

266
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:31,839
He wants

267
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:38,239
Every part of the Buffalo of making you feel things about masculine

268
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:43,871
Attack the masculinity like football

269
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:45,151
It's very confusing

270
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:46,687
I don't know

271
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:52,831
And masculine as masculine being in his conception

272
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:55,135
And in terms of that I don't care to be like

273
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:56,159
You like football

274
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:59,999
Let's do let's go

275
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:00,767
To this episode

276
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:02,303
Here's how the episode start

277
00:16:02,815 --> 00:16:04,863
With Alex introducing the topic of

278
00:16:05,119 --> 00:16:05,631
Ebola

279
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:21,503
Infowars.com

280
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:29,951
Americans

281
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:34,047
2014

282
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:35,839
Does not open up

283
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:37,119
The phone to another phone

284
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:42,495
Minutes after this so badly

285
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:47,103
I don't remember

286
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:48,127
McCain

287
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:54,271
Ebola

288
00:16:54,527 --> 00:17:00,671
I read it on

289
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:07,327
So a lot of feelings about this situation

290
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:09,375
I'm certain you can

291
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:15,007
I don't want to put you on the spot

292
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:15,775
Alright

293
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:16,543
Here is

294
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:18,847
Here is mine.

295
00:17:19,103 --> 00:17:19,615
Alright

296
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:21,407
Now it's any good if you're right

297
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:25,759
If you're wrong

298
00:17:29,343 --> 00:17:30,623
Should still be applicable

299
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:37,023
Far away that was close to where we started yet

300
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:42,399
So he's closer to early 2015 investigation Alex

301
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:47,007
Then other versions of Alex that is a metric

302
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:48,543
Go for it

303
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:49,567
Here's the facts

304
00:17:56,223 --> 00:17:59,551
1850s comedy writer that is repurposing

305
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:03,903
I am 100% certain that this is Obama's fault

306
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:09,279
That there's going to be a lot of racism

307
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:10,047
Because it's

308
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:11,071
In Africa

309
00:18:11,327 --> 00:18:12,863
Walk the same time he's going to

310
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:13,631
Pretend

311
00:18:14,143 --> 00:18:15,167
He is a crusader

312
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:16,447
For a

313
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:22,847
Freaking people make sure that everybody got to be a little bit of that about black people

314
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:29,247
Veiled but it certainly there

315
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:30,271
Genetic

316
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:32,575
Diseases and

317
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:33,343
Is it Africa

318
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:37,695
Because they know you won't care about that time the guy lands in Dallas

319
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:39,999
That's how we know that they're beginning

320
00:18:42,047 --> 00:18:48,191
Jordan you just got to be on your final exam

321
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:51,263
You couldn't possibly expect

322
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:54,079
It's better also part of his narrative like this

323
00:18:54,847 --> 00:18:56,895
MSNBC headlines

324
00:18:58,943 --> 00:19:01,503
NRA is making me ebola crisis worse

325
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:05,087
Good job

326
00:19:05,855 --> 00:19:07,135
With Ebola in Texas

327
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:21,215
That's what the federal government does

328
00:19:21,471 --> 00:19:27,615
Finally found out what the federal government

329
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:38,623
Federal Aviation

330
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:48,095
Road

331
00:19:48,351 --> 00:19:49,119
He lost

332
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:54,751
Look the federal government can fly planes whenever they want

333
00:19:55,007 --> 00:19:55,519
The sky

334
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:59,871
He hates Rick Berry.

335
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:01,151
Videos like

336
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:01,919
Would you eat

337
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:02,687
Do is

338
00:20:04,223 --> 00:20:04,735
Facebook

339
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:08,575
Rick Perry isn't being aggressive enough

340
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:09,343
That's

341
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:11,903
Deficiency of Obama

342
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:13,183
Because the flight

343
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:14,719
That's a federal

344
00:20:15,231 --> 00:20:15,743
And by the way

345
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:23,167
But also we see this introduction of this news story

346
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:26,239
But the NRA is making

347
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:28,799
Alice's bucking not happy about that

348
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:35,455
Statistics

349
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:38,271
If you continue to think about it you're like

350
00:20:39,295 --> 00:20:41,855
I don't want to throw them on this

351
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:43,135
1

352
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:46,207
Deana Ray can't possibly

353
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:52,351
Zebolek

354
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:55,423
I don't think they're actively going out and giving people

355
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:57,727
Who wouldn't otherwise get Ebola

356
00:20:58,239 --> 00:21:03,615
About we will find out exactly what this article is about as soon as Alex actually talked about it

357
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:10,015
But for now he's just complaining about a headline cuz he hasn't read the article spoiler alert

358
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:11,039
But

359
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:17,184
And how that's involved

360
00:21:19,232 --> 00:21:20,768
Paralyzed

361
00:21:24,608 --> 00:21:28,704
Like a boss

362
00:21:29,216 --> 00:21:35,360
Halloween party

363
00:21:39,456 --> 00:21:44,064
Cowboys

364
00:21:49,952 --> 00:21:51,488
Bollywood do you mean

365
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:54,304
Complained

366
00:21:54,816 --> 00:22:00,960
No.

367
00:22:01,216 --> 00:22:01,984
Shut it down

368
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,056
Wearing a suit previous fight

369
00:22:05,824 --> 00:22:07,104
Even

370
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,640
Truck slides down

371
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:12,480
Countries where their estimated 1.4 to 5 million people

372
00:22:12,736 --> 00:22:13,760
Will get Ebola

373
00:22:14,272 --> 00:22:15,808
Discord

374
00:22:19,136 --> 00:22:24,512
So did this PC culture is stopping us

375
00:22:24,768 --> 00:22:30,912
I'm talking about this as it really is in the same way

376
00:22:31,168 --> 00:22:33,984
Don't use them

377
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,288
That is

378
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,592
A good rule of thumb

379
00:22:38,848 --> 00:22:42,688
I don't know about this yoga studio because it sounds a lot like

380
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:48,576
That

381
00:22:48,832 --> 00:22:49,344
Cap that

382
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:52,416
Those things that the yoga studio people are talking about how like

383
00:22:52,672 --> 00:22:54,720
We can't have a fun India party

384
00:22:54,976 --> 00:22:58,304
That sounds exactly like the side characters in the Nazi hat

385
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:03,680
Halloween weather like

386
00:23:03,936 --> 00:23:07,264
Terrible

387
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:12,384
Come on Alex wouldn't you be so offended if a black person dressed up as chicken fingers and fries

388
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,408
Install your culture

389
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:19,296
Like millions of people are going to

390
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:22,112
Also

391
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:23,904
He eventually does end up saying

392
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,184
Hundreds of thousands

393
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:25,952
The people have it

394
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,488
He's going to say that

395
00:23:28,256 --> 00:23:29,024
I want to tell you

396
00:23:29,536 --> 00:23:31,584
When it was all over

397
00:23:32,096 --> 00:23:33,120
In 2016

398
00:23:33,376 --> 00:23:38,240
2016 Guinea was officially declared Ebola Free

399
00:23:39,264 --> 00:23:41,568
28600 people

400
00:23:41,824 --> 00:23:42,336
Total

401
00:23:42,592 --> 00:23:45,408
Total got Ebola

402
00:23:45,664 --> 00:23:46,432
Liberia

403
00:23:46,688 --> 00:23:49,760
Sierra Leone

404
00:23:50,016 --> 00:23:51,552
Mali Nigeria

405
00:23:51,808 --> 00:23:53,344
Italy

406
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:57,696
The United Kingdom there was a case there a couple people in Spain Senegal

407
00:23:59,232 --> 00:24:00,256
The US

408
00:24:00,512 --> 00:24:01,024
Can we just

409
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:04,864
Say real quick that's amazing against vaccines

410
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,912
Even then

411
00:24:07,168 --> 00:24:08,192
And if you are against vaccine

412
00:24:09,984 --> 00:24:11,008
System of

413
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,800
Rooting out disease if that's

414
00:24:13,056 --> 00:24:14,592
The total number people got it

415
00:24:14,848 --> 00:24:15,872
Now

416
00:24:17,152 --> 00:24:18,688
Especially over a

417
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:23,296
2-year plus timeframe to be like Holy Ship

418
00:24:23,552 --> 00:24:29,440
It could have been way worse than they were 11,000

419
00:24:29,696 --> 00:24:31,232
325 death

420
00:24:31,488 --> 00:24:32,512
Out of those 20

421
00:24:34,048 --> 00:24:35,072
Witches

422
00:24:41,472 --> 00:24:42,240
Super Idol I don't know

423
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:52,224
There are times in history where it's like

424
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,248
North of 90

425
00:24:53,504 --> 00:24:54,528
Percent

426
00:24:55,808 --> 00:24:56,320
You are

427
00:24:56,832 --> 00:24:58,624
Remember I was looking at the statistics

428
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,440
It turns like a country-by-country breakdown

429
00:25:01,696 --> 00:25:02,720
This 2014

430
00:25:02,976 --> 00:25:07,584
It's some countries there was a 0% fatality rate

431
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:08,864
Percent

432
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,680
Before it ended up getting it

433
00:25:20,384 --> 00:25:22,176
I don't think the numbers were even

434
00:25:22,432 --> 00:25:26,784
Super 40 is right around the total

435
00:25:27,552 --> 00:25:31,136
Just extrapolate from there it is lower than some outbreaks

436
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,208
That being said

437
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,704
That's amazing and

438
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:45,728
And anybody

439
00:25:45,984 --> 00:25:46,496
You like Alex

440
00:25:46,752 --> 00:25:47,520
Bitching about it

441
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:49,312
All this

442
00:25:49,568 --> 00:25:50,336
Is the worst thing that

443
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:51,104
Could ever happen

444
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:53,152
Should also at the end of 22

445
00:25:53,408 --> 00:25:53,920
16 say

446
00:25:54,944 --> 00:25:55,968
Got to give it up to him

447
00:25:56,224 --> 00:25:57,248
That's f****** amazed

448
00:25:57,504 --> 00:26:03,648
We expect in 2014

449
00:26:03,904 --> 00:26:05,440
Results

450
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:06,720
But

451
00:26:06,976 --> 00:26:11,328
Him saying that they're like hundreds of thousands of people who have Ebola in 2014

452
00:26:11,584 --> 00:26:13,120
But at the end of it

453
00:26:13,376 --> 00:26:15,680
It's just north of a quarter of 100,000

454
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:21,312
At the end of it

455
00:26:23,104 --> 00:26:25,152
Blowing this way out of proportion

456
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:28,224
You think that

457
00:26:28,736 --> 00:26:29,760
The United States

458
00:26:30,016 --> 00:26:33,344
Particular

459
00:26:33,856 --> 00:26:34,368
Trees other than

460
00:26:34,624 --> 00:26:37,184
Arcgis

461
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,720
To make sure that the stuff

462
00:26:38,976 --> 00:26:39,488
Become a problem

463
00:26:40,256 --> 00:26:41,536
The Arab country

464
00:26:53,824 --> 00:26:56,640
Sierra Leone Liberia and other areas

465
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:01,504
Academic level

466
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:10,208
By the end of the year

467
00:27:10,464 --> 00:27:13,024
That's not what they're saying there aren't there were like all these

468
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,048
Sites that were given

469
00:27:14,304 --> 00:27:16,608
Terrible worst case scenario is

470
00:27:18,656 --> 00:27:20,960
So he's using it all these other countries

471
00:27:21,472 --> 00:27:23,776
Due to these travel bans on people

472
00:27:24,032 --> 00:27:24,800
Affected countries

473
00:27:25,056 --> 00:27:26,080
And United States

474
00:27:26,336 --> 00:27:27,104
Won't do that

475
00:27:27,616 --> 00:27:28,640
And that's f***** up

476
00:27:29,664 --> 00:27:35,808
Give me aftermath of an outbreak it makes total sense to think that the solution is closing down borders and restricting travel to countries where

477
00:27:36,064 --> 00:27:37,600
Is that particular medical issue exist

478
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:41,696
Closer look at history all you see is evidence of these travel ban

479
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:45,536
Don't work make things worse and are stupid Miss allocation

480
00:27:45,792 --> 00:27:47,328
That doesn't sound right

481
00:27:48,864 --> 00:27:54,240
1987 people with HIV or Aids Coming to America

482
00:27:54,752 --> 00:27:55,776
This did nothing to restrict

483
00:27:56,032 --> 00:27:57,056
Spread of the disease

484
00:27:57,312 --> 00:27:58,848
The conditions

485
00:27:59,104 --> 00:28:05,248
And in 1989 impractical costly

486
00:28:05,504 --> 00:28:06,272
Full anime

487
00:28:06,528 --> 00:28:07,296
Discriminatory

488
00:28:07,808 --> 00:28:10,880
The study found the Travelers played little to no role in the spread

489
00:28:11,136 --> 00:28:13,696
But efforts toward prevention and actual difference

490
00:28:14,208 --> 00:28:17,024
Beyond that they found its green Travelers 4-H ivna

491
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:19,584
Was all good and well but the process wasn't

492
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:20,352
Musically flawed

493
00:28:20,608 --> 00:28:24,704
It would inevitably lead to negative positive and vice versa

494
00:28:25,984 --> 00:28:27,008
Beatley pointless

495
00:28:27,264 --> 00:28:30,848
This infected until Obama got in office

496
00:28:31,104 --> 00:28:32,384
I'm really glad

497
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:33,152
That we

498
00:28:33,408 --> 00:28:33,920
We learned our

499
00:28:34,688 --> 00:28:35,200
Realized

500
00:28:35,456 --> 00:28:36,224
The travel bans were

501
00:28:37,248 --> 00:28:38,784
And never again tried to

502
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:42,368
No no

503
00:28:42,624 --> 00:28:44,160
87 Reagan football

504
00:28:44,416 --> 00:28:50,304
And we don't even really even remember that

505
00:28:51,072 --> 00:28:53,632
After 2008

506
00:28:53,888 --> 00:28:54,656
It's crazy

507
00:28:54,912 --> 00:29:01,056
It's crazy because it's absolutely not

508
00:29:07,456 --> 00:29:13,344
Athx out in terms of like what you'd expect kind of

509
00:29:13,856 --> 00:29:14,880
I didn't think

510
00:29:15,904 --> 00:29:16,416
We were that

511
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:18,464
It wasn't until Obama's administration

512
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,000
Anybody was like

513
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:22,304
We should care

514
00:29:23,328 --> 00:29:23,840
About you

515
00:29:26,656 --> 00:29:28,448
Maybe the government

516
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:32,800
Specifically like hiv-positive even all the way through it what I like with Clinton

517
00:29:33,056 --> 00:29:35,104
Commenter about Asia

518
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,920
And you don't expect W to do anything positive

519
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:39,200
Ever

520
00:29:39,456 --> 00:29:39,968
Yeah

521
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:43,808
Social evolution

522
00:29:44,064 --> 00:29:48,672
Some good progress being made being under W progress and stuff

523
00:29:48,928 --> 00:29:50,976
You're never going to see that mirrored up top

524
00:29:51,232 --> 00:29:52,768
No Doubt

525
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:55,584
Anyway it's a bummer

526
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:56,864
Also

527
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:03,264
After some cases of H1 N1 in Mexico in 2009 many countries cut off lights to and from the come

528
00:30:04,032 --> 00:30:06,848
There's a 40% decrease in Mexican travel volume

529
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:13,504
A study after the fact found the quote own that only led to an average delay in arrival of the infection another car

530
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,040
Countries is the first

531
00:30:15,296 --> 00:30:16,064
Imported case

532
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:18,112
Of Less Than 3 days

533
00:30:18,624 --> 00:30:21,952
And they found quote no containment was achieved by such restriction

534
00:30:22,208 --> 00:30:24,512
So there's a consistent pattern that

535
00:30:24,768 --> 00:30:30,912
That shows that all you're doing is putting things off by a couple days in service of what

536
00:30:32,192 --> 00:30:32,704
I think

537
00:30:33,216 --> 00:30:33,728
And I'm

538
00:30:33,984 --> 00:30:35,520
I'm sure that this did not affect

539
00:30:36,032 --> 00:30:40,128
Thorsten, Oregon

540
00:30:40,384 --> 00:30:41,152
It's almost like it

541
00:30:41,408 --> 00:30:43,200
Positive things

542
00:30:45,504 --> 00:30:46,272
Made destitute

543
00:30:46,528 --> 00:30:47,040
So many places

544
00:30:47,296 --> 00:30:48,064
Is that red light on that

545
00:30:49,088 --> 00:30:52,672
We're going to get you some of those like issues it actually kind of minimal

546
00:30:54,976 --> 00:30:59,072
Hemorrhagic fever

547
00:30:59,584 --> 00:31:03,424
Finances

548
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:05,728
That belongs in the calculus but it's

549
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:11,616
Craft if it matters more than people fly

550
00:31:14,688 --> 00:31:15,456
About it and your absolute

551
00:31:15,968 --> 00:31:19,808
Of the actual travel ban

552
00:31:20,064 --> 00:31:23,648
Put in place in response to the outbreak of Ebola sound

553
00:31:23,904 --> 00:31:30,048
The bands are only delaying the further International spread Ebola outbreak in West Africa for a limited time

554
00:31:30,304 --> 00:31:32,864
At the risk of compromising connected

555
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:33,632
Mobilization

556
00:31:33,888 --> 00:31:34,400
Enough resources

557
00:31:34,656 --> 00:31:35,424
To the affected area

558
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:37,472
Sustained response operation

559
00:31:37,984 --> 00:31:38,752
All actions

560
00:31:39,008 --> 00:31:42,592
Critical value to the immediate local control of the vola

561
00:31:42,848 --> 00:31:44,896
And for preventing its further geographical

562
00:31:45,152 --> 00:31:47,712
Spread so all you do is end up sacrificing

563
00:31:47,968 --> 00:31:50,016
The idea of people being mobile to stomach

564
00:31:50,272 --> 00:31:52,320
Text Dad for the sake of

565
00:31:52,832 --> 00:31:56,928
Some imaginary lockdown

566
00:31:57,184 --> 00:32:00,000
For a lockdown that doesn't make any sense

567
00:32:00,256 --> 00:32:00,768
Well

568
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:03,072
Not allocating any resources

569
00:32:03,328 --> 00:32:06,912
To the treatment that would help a lot of

570
00:32:12,032 --> 00:32:12,800
To do but it's not

571
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:17,920
Not only does it not work historically fit it actually hurts things for two important in Turkey

572
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:24,832
The first is that it's not really a reality that you're ever going to be able to shut down all travel across borders

573
00:32:25,088 --> 00:32:26,112
Borders are cute

574
00:32:26,368 --> 00:32:27,392
And people who really want

575
00:32:27,648 --> 00:32:29,440
To badly enough they want to leave

576
00:32:29,696 --> 00:32:32,000
Don't find Pachel and I can slip across the border

577
00:32:32,256 --> 00:32:32,768
It's going to happen

578
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:36,096
But you're never going to be able to completely insulate some

579
00:32:36,864 --> 00:32:38,400
This leads to the second problem

580
00:32:38,912 --> 00:32:41,728
If you travel for people from the affected region

581
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:45,312
You create an incentive for these people to lie about where they're traveling

582
00:32:45,568 --> 00:32:48,896
From which a variable you could monitor

583
00:32:50,432 --> 00:32:51,200
Wheatley on the counter

584
00:32:51,968 --> 00:32:54,272
Studies that show that this is the case

585
00:32:54,528 --> 00:33:00,672
Alex did not know this means that he's not operating from a position of wanting what's best for the world he's just looking for any

586
00:33:00,928 --> 00:33:02,976
Any excuse confined to let Africa burn

587
00:33:03,744 --> 00:33:04,768
The idea is

588
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:06,048
When you do these

589
00:33:06,304 --> 00:33:07,072
These sorts of things

590
00:33:08,096 --> 00:33:10,144
Like I said there is lying

591
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:12,704
There's someone is from let's say Guinea

592
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:17,824
And they make it across a couple Borders or whatever

593
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:23,200
Perhaps they may also have it

594
00:33:23,456 --> 00:33:29,600
They're not showing they're not they could slip into another country like

595
00:33:29,856 --> 00:33:30,368
Weather from

596
00:33:30,624 --> 00:33:32,672
Be able to travel because that country

597
00:33:32,928 --> 00:33:34,976
Where they they are coming from

598
00:33:35,232 --> 00:33:36,000
Isn't

599
00:33:36,256 --> 00:33:38,304
Included in this band and what you do

600
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:39,072
Is

601
00:33:39,328 --> 00:33:40,352
You're not able to

602
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,400
I know it sounds ugly and Turf

603
00:33:43,168 --> 00:33:43,680
Flag them

604
00:33:43,936 --> 00:33:45,984
But when you have an outbreak

605
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:49,824
It is in everyone's best interest to like if you are traveling from that country

606
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:51,360
We need to know

607
00:33:51,872 --> 00:33:56,480
We don't want to hurt you you we need to be able to keep an eye just in case maybe we

608
00:33:56,736 --> 00:34:01,600
Terrible

609
00:34:01,856 --> 00:34:04,416
Which

610
00:34:04,672 --> 00:34:05,696
Kim do

611
00:34:05,952 --> 00:34:07,232
If you allowed to travel but

612
00:34:07,488 --> 00:34:08,000
If you

613
00:34:08,256 --> 00:34:10,816
Shut that everything down close all borders

614
00:34:11,072 --> 00:34:12,096
What you do is

615
00:34:12,352 --> 00:34:13,888
Incentivize breaking

616
00:34:14,144 --> 00:34:15,680
Of the Courant

617
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:17,984
Prohibition

618
00:34:18,752 --> 00:34:19,520
Does it work

619
00:34:20,288 --> 00:34:24,896
Yeah level don't work out there over and over and over

620
00:34:25,408 --> 00:34:27,200
If you want to quarantine something very small

621
00:34:27,456 --> 00:34:30,528
Person in hospitals it does work very effective

622
00:34:31,296 --> 00:34:33,344
It also relies heavily on

623
00:34:35,392 --> 00:34:37,184
Incredibly important piece of

624
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:37,952
Quarantine

625
00:34:38,208 --> 00:34:40,768
Yeah but if you want if you want

626
00:34:41,792 --> 00:34:44,096
How willing are you to kill someone who's going to leave

627
00:34:44,608 --> 00:34:46,912
But you want to turn this into a

628
00:34:47,168 --> 00:34:48,704
Or whatever like that is the other piece

629
00:34:49,216 --> 00:34:49,728
Yeah like

630
00:34:49,984 --> 00:34:51,520
If you do want to do that

631
00:34:52,288 --> 00:34:53,824
Okay your conception is

632
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:55,360
X area

633
00:34:56,128 --> 00:34:57,152
Is shutdown

634
00:34:57,408 --> 00:34:58,432
Because there was a baller

635
00:34:59,456 --> 00:35:00,480
If someone tries to leave

636
00:35:00,992 --> 00:35:01,504
Do you murder them

637
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:03,040
Do you kill them because

638
00:35:03,296 --> 00:35:09,440
If they get out someone else might have

639
00:35:10,464 --> 00:35:10,976
If it is

640
00:35:11,488 --> 00:35:12,512
We have a different conversation to have

641
00:35:12,768 --> 00:35:13,280
Right

642
00:35:13,792 --> 00:35:15,840
Bite my big point is the Alex

643
00:35:16,352 --> 00:35:17,120
Understand that

644
00:35:17,376 --> 00:35:18,912
Travel bans don't really work

645
00:35:19,168 --> 00:35:20,960
Example of

646
00:35:21,216 --> 00:35:23,520
Do UK shutdown travel to

647
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:27,104
Of course

648
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:27,872
Ayodhya

649
00:35:28,128 --> 00:35:30,944
There's a bunch of countries that ended up

650
00:35:31,456 --> 00:35:31,968
If not

651
00:35:32,992 --> 00:35:33,504
It's not affect

652
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,064
It's Alex's

653
00:35:43,232 --> 00:35:44,000
Very weird

654
00:35:45,024 --> 00:35:48,608
You're 100 years ago

655
00:35:50,656 --> 00:35:52,192
Ellis Island

656
00:35:57,568 --> 00:35:59,872
Come on, I'll come

657
00:36:02,176 --> 00:36:06,016
You you had just the right response to that

658
00:36:06,528 --> 00:36:12,672
Positively that Ellis Island with his firmly anti-immigration positions that

659
00:36:12,928 --> 00:36:13,440
All the time

660
00:36:13,696 --> 00:36:19,328
We all know the reason why he speaks about Ellis Island as a positive thing is because of the immigrants coming in other one teeth

661
00:36:19,584 --> 00:36:20,352
Goodwin

662
00:36:23,936 --> 00:36:26,496
Stupid

663
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:28,032
Think about it

664
00:36:28,544 --> 00:36:31,872
These people came over here on Ocean Center

665
00:36:32,128 --> 00:36:32,896
The tens of thousands

666
00:36:33,408 --> 00:36:36,736
Thousands of was not an uncommon thing.

667
00:36:37,248 --> 00:36:40,320
If two-thirds of them were turned away where would they f****** go

668
00:36:40,576 --> 00:36:46,720
Are you going to incarcerate all those people how much do you think that would cost are you going to pay for ships to take them back to wherever they came from

669
00:36:46,976 --> 00:36:50,560
How much you think that would cost Animal Crossing

670
00:36:50,816 --> 00:36:51,584
Crossing the sea

671
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:55,424
I'll tell you what you should shut down the government to make sure that it doesn't happen

672
00:36:55,680 --> 00:37:00,288
Reality only 10% of the people who arrived at Ellis Island

673
00:37:00,544 --> 00:37:01,056
Health screening

674
00:37:01,568 --> 00:37:03,616
And 90% of those people were passed through with

675
00:37:04,896 --> 00:37:06,432
According to Berry Monero

676
00:37:06,688 --> 00:37:10,016
Ellis Island historian the Ellis Island Museum

677
00:37:10,272 --> 00:37:16,160
The people charged with rooting out Communists anarchist

678
00:37:16,416 --> 00:37:17,696
Impossible labor Edge

679
00:37:18,464 --> 00:37:21,280
That was a very high priority in their screening interviews

680
00:37:22,304 --> 00:37:24,864
Mental Asylum very missed his real

681
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:31,264
Calling because of his name is Barry Manilow he should have been the greatest jazz artists of his age

682
00:37:37,408 --> 00:37:42,528
Most immigrants who came through Ellis Island

683
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:45,856
They're processed through they got through Ellis Island

684
00:37:46,112 --> 00:37:46,880
Generally

685
00:37:47,136 --> 00:37:49,952
Generally 25 hours

686
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:56,864
Came up in their their history

687
00:37:57,120 --> 00:38:03,264
Etched on them before they came

688
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:07,360
Is there a criminology

689
00:38:07,872 --> 00:38:09,152
But if you forgot

690
00:38:09,408 --> 00:38:11,968
Process

691
00:38:12,224 --> 00:38:14,784
They got a dormitory and provided

692
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:20,672
Now obviously doing so good back then

693
00:38:20,928 --> 00:38:27,072
It was a perfect Cinderella Castle wasn't treated all that well but still like if you look back on it

694
00:38:28,352 --> 00:38:34,496
Really better than what's going on now

695
00:38:34,752 --> 00:38:37,824
Let's do good

696
00:38:38,336 --> 00:38:38,848
Bananas

697
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:40,128
You know how many immigrants

698
00:38:40,384 --> 00:38:43,200
I know that Alex says that it's

699
00:38:43,456 --> 00:38:47,552
66% how many go away 23

700
00:38:47,808 --> 00:38:49,344
Phone number is 2%

701
00:38:50,112 --> 00:38:54,464
Court Vincent cannot associate professor of history at the University of Massachusetts Boston

702
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:56,256
And author of the American package

703
00:38:56,512 --> 00:38:57,536
Search the history of Ellis Island

704
00:38:57,792 --> 00:38:58,304
Quote

705
00:38:58,816 --> 00:39:02,144
The greatest contradiction or irony here

706
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,448
Can processed meat have this restriction ascent

707
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:07,264
And all these people you want to keep out of the country

708
00:39:09,056 --> 00:39:10,592
Less than 2%

709
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:13,664
It's a very small number of people who got rejected

710
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:14,944
Even with

711
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:17,504
Medical issues being considered

712
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:20,064
One of the things you know like

713
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,600
This one here there's like a

714
00:39:21,856 --> 00:39:23,136
1000 people who got rejected

715
00:39:23,392 --> 00:39:25,696
He wasn't for hepatitis or whatever Alex

716
00:39:25,952 --> 00:39:27,488
Thanks

717
00:39:27,744 --> 00:39:28,256
Condition

718
00:39:28,512 --> 00:39:29,280
Close

719
00:39:29,792 --> 00:39:30,816
Chlamydia

720
00:39:31,072 --> 00:39:31,840
Contagious

721
00:39:32,096 --> 00:39:32,864
One of the easiest

722
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:33,632
Detectable thing

723
00:39:34,144 --> 00:39:34,656
A lot of

724
00:39:34,912 --> 00:39:41,056
I probably would have made it

725
00:39:41,568 --> 00:39:44,384
That look about you

726
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:50,784
So you got 1,100 people

727
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:54,880
Mass in one year

728
00:39:55,136 --> 00:39:57,184
300000 people that came

729
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:01,280
Over a million at least one or two

730
00:40:01,536 --> 00:40:03,328
Years

731
00:40:04,608 --> 00:40:06,144
It's not

732
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,680
Obviously Ellis Island

733
00:40:08,192 --> 00:40:08,704
Perfect

734
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:10,496
Story of great success

735
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:12,544
But Alex

736
00:40:13,312 --> 00:40:14,592
Perpetuate this idea

737
00:40:16,128 --> 00:40:20,992
Through everybody

738
00:40:21,248 --> 00:40:22,272
To a past that doesn't

739
00:40:25,856 --> 00:40:27,904
And he's only doing it in service of

740
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:28,928
Trying to

741
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:31,232
I think what it is if I had to

742
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,024
I think he doesn't know any

743
00:40:33,536 --> 00:40:35,328
Number one

744
00:40:36,352 --> 00:40:36,864
Emotional

745
00:40:37,376 --> 00:40:38,144
For it is

746
00:40:38,656 --> 00:40:40,704
Justifying why those white

747
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:41,472
Immigrants

748
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,008
Are good

749
00:40:43,264 --> 00:40:44,544
Not based on their skin

750
00:40:45,056 --> 00:40:47,360
But I think I think so

751
00:40:47,616 --> 00:40:48,384
Come down to the logistic

752
00:40:49,664 --> 00:40:50,176
Incarcerate

753
00:40:52,224 --> 00:40:53,504
So much

754
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:57,088
Because even if you were incarcerated him eventually what he had to send it back

755
00:40:57,344 --> 00:40:59,136
So what do you send them back immediately

756
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:03,744
Italy to pay for it

757
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:08,096
And there's no easy answer to it may think

758
00:41:08,352 --> 00:41:08,864
The people in charge

759
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:09,632
Recognize

760
00:41:09,888 --> 00:41:11,424
Is that an aired on the side of

761
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:12,192
Feel like

762
00:41:12,448 --> 00:41:13,984
All right let's do like

763
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:15,008
Legit Danes

764
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:19,104
Probably only take us a couple hours per person

765
00:41:19,872 --> 00:41:26,016
We have it we have the ability to do this alright has a lot of nails coming out

766
00:41:26,272 --> 00:41:32,416
And we have not made Hellraiser yet so I can't I can't process

767
00:41:34,464 --> 00:41:40,608
Freedom 10 hours for a bit I found that to be really fascinating I didn't know

768
00:41:40,864 --> 00:41:47,008
Was that low

769
00:41:48,544 --> 00:41:52,384
Something I always enjoyed

770
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:53,663
Help me learn a little

771
00:41:55,711 --> 00:41:57,759
We get back to the show

772
00:41:58,015 --> 00:41:58,783
Alex's show

773
00:41:59,039 --> 00:42:00,831
And Alex has

774
00:42:01,855 --> 00:42:03,135
Do you have some ideas of

775
00:42:03,391 --> 00:42:03,903
Houses

776
00:42:04,671 --> 00:42:05,183
Handle

777
00:42:05,951 --> 00:42:07,999
The case of the gentleman who came to

778
00:42:08,255 --> 00:42:09,023
Dallas

779
00:42:09,279 --> 00:42:11,071
That was my favorite Hardy Boys book

780
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:14,143
The case of the gentleman came to Dallas

781
00:42:14,399 --> 00:42:20,287
I wish I could have gone with Encyclopedia Brown

782
00:42:21,055 --> 00:42:21,567
Listen

783
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:28,223
We could name the Texas all day we really could I got a few I got to Tara

784
00:42:28,479 --> 00:42:30,527
Furniture in my boot

785
00:42:34,623 --> 00:42:35,391
This guy came

786
00:42:35,647 --> 00:42:36,927
Dallas

787
00:42:37,951 --> 00:42:38,463
Shut up

788
00:42:38,719 --> 00:42:39,487
Shutdown

789
00:42:44,351 --> 00:42:46,655
That's on me

790
00:42:48,191 --> 00:42:48,703
My friend

791
00:42:52,543 --> 00:42:56,127
I don't know how to start this. I want to see how this goes

792
00:42:57,151 --> 00:42:58,943
Has some ideas

793
00:42:59,199 --> 00:43:00,479
Is about the handling of

794
00:43:00,991 --> 00:43:01,503
The circumstance

795
00:43:01,759 --> 00:43:03,039
Cuz of the Ebola case

796
00:43:04,063 --> 00:43:06,111
And I'll say that

797
00:43:06,367 --> 00:43:07,135
You believe him

798
00:43:07,647 --> 00:43:08,671
This town suspicious

799
00:43:10,207 --> 00:43:11,231
He's also wrong about every

800
00:43:15,327 --> 00:43:18,143
Before

801
00:43:19,935 --> 00:43:22,239
They gave him antibiotics and virus

802
00:43:25,823 --> 00:43:28,127
Clean for a week the hot V

803
00:43:28,383 --> 00:43:29,151
The ambulance

804
00:43:39,903 --> 00:43:41,439
Because they obviously wanted to spread

805
00:43:41,951 --> 00:43:42,463
So

806
00:43:43,487 --> 00:43:47,071
First thing that pops out to me I think actually was the first thing you responded

807
00:43:55,775 --> 00:43:59,359
Shift clean the f****** ambulance

808
00:44:00,895 --> 00:44:03,199
Where was the first place that I went

809
00:44:03,967 --> 00:44:04,479
When I was looking at

810
00:44:06,271 --> 00:44:07,551
I can't I can't imagine

811
00:44:07,807 --> 00:44:09,343
Absolute so I looked into it

812
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:15,231
Trying as hard as I can to create the image of the powers-that-be

813
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:19,071
It seems like a huge part of his argument

814
00:44:19,327 --> 00:44:20,095
Ambulance hasn't been

815
00:44:20,351 --> 00:44:21,631
The week

816
00:44:22,143 --> 00:44:25,471
Alex is reporting is on October 5th when was this episode released made

817
00:44:26,495 --> 00:44:28,287
Because he was on vacation when the news broke

818
00:44:29,567 --> 00:44:30,847
September 3rd

819
00:44:32,639 --> 00:44:35,711
I will not reach you from an article in Dallas-Fort Worth

820
00:44:35,967 --> 00:44:39,807
From September 30th

821
00:44:40,063 --> 00:44:41,855
In question had Ebola in it we ask

822
00:44:42,111 --> 00:44:43,903
Actually lit on fire and then

823
00:44:44,159 --> 00:44:45,951
And through the ashes into a frozen lake

824
00:44:46,207 --> 00:44:52,351
In order to because that is underneath

825
00:44:52,607 --> 00:44:57,215
The Creator perpetually Frozen and burning light

826
00:45:01,311 --> 00:45:03,359
Mayor Mike Rawlings

827
00:45:03,615 --> 00:45:06,431
Confirm that an EMS crew

828
00:45:06,687 --> 00:45:12,831
Isolated

829
00:45:13,087 --> 00:45:19,231
We've quarantined both of them and to make sure that nothing was nothing was there that can spread

830
00:45:19,487 --> 00:45:25,119
And we're going about our protocol about how to do that says the bear

831
00:45:25,631 --> 00:45:26,143
Just said

832
00:45:27,679 --> 00:45:33,823
Top 40 from exactly what you would expect people to do

833
00:45:34,847 --> 00:45:36,639
Alex

834
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:39,711
What is a quarantine

835
00:45:39,967 --> 00:45:40,735
Clean it

836
00:45:41,247 --> 00:45:42,527
Unfortunately later in the article

837
00:45:42,783 --> 00:45:46,879
Dallas fire and rescue officials said the ambulance has been decontaminated

838
00:45:47,647 --> 00:45:52,255
I was just making sure it up to make it look like the people running Point doing their jobs

839
00:45:52,767 --> 00:45:56,607
Plenty of other valid criticisms to make about how the whole thing was handled

840
00:45:57,119 --> 00:45:57,887
And we'll get into some of them

841
00:45:58,399 --> 00:45:59,679
But this isn't one of them

842
00:46:00,191 --> 00:46:03,519
This is complete nonsense Alex probably reading this on some job blog

843
00:46:03,775 --> 00:46:04,543
Or something like that

844
00:46:04,799 --> 00:46:07,359
Absolutely not true

845
00:46:07,615 --> 00:46:13,759
There's more than just that article but that's just local Dallas reporting

846
00:46:14,015 --> 00:46:15,295
We did do that we took care of that

847
00:46:17,855 --> 00:46:19,135
He's on air on October

848
00:46:19,391 --> 00:46:19,903
4/5

849
00:46:20,159 --> 00:46:21,439
Saying they never did

850
00:46:21,951 --> 00:46:23,487
Vandoit

851
00:46:23,743 --> 00:46:25,279
Know that the guy had Ebola

852
00:46:25,535 --> 00:46:26,047
They still would have

853
00:46:26,559 --> 00:46:27,839
Theme to The fuc

854
00:46:28,095 --> 00:46:28,607
Distant

855
00:46:31,167 --> 00:46:35,263
Absolutely

856
00:46:36,287 --> 00:46:37,823
Not that I am taking

857
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:38,847
The mayor

858
00:46:39,103 --> 00:46:40,127
At his word

859
00:46:40,383 --> 00:46:43,967
In the article in question

860
00:46:44,223 --> 00:46:45,247
No that's how are you

861
00:46:45,759 --> 00:46:47,551
The Cowboys have

862
00:46:48,063 --> 00:46:48,575
Talk to me

863
00:46:50,623 --> 00:46:51,391
The article in question

864
00:46:51,647 --> 00:46:52,927
Also had a picture of

865
00:46:53,183 --> 00:46:53,695
The ambulance

866
00:46:53,951 --> 00:46:55,999
Important

867
00:46:56,255 --> 00:46:58,559
I did also Steve

868
00:47:02,911 --> 00:47:07,519
It's not that I'm just trusting blindly the mayor of Dallas

869
00:47:08,031 --> 00:47:12,127
Overnight with police tape around areola

870
00:47:12,383 --> 00:47:13,151
Then call it the real one

871
00:47:13,407 --> 00:47:13,919
Chirp

872
00:47:15,967 --> 00:47:17,759
But also in that article it is

873
00:47:18,015 --> 00:47:21,343
Important clip that Alex

874
00:47:22,111 --> 00:47:23,903
Just talkin he said that they gave

875
00:47:24,415 --> 00:47:24,927
Antibiotics

876
00:47:26,463 --> 00:47:26,975
Coronavirus

877
00:47:28,255 --> 00:47:29,023
Interesting

878
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:31,583
What does

879
00:47:32,095 --> 00:47:33,375
So when they say biotic

880
00:47:34,143 --> 00:47:36,191
Would you say they are talking more about that

881
00:47:37,471 --> 00:47:37,983
Now

882
00:47:44,895 --> 00:47:47,711
If I remember biology correctly viruses

883
00:47:48,735 --> 00:47:50,271
Cannot be killed

884
00:47:50,527 --> 00:47:52,319
No

885
00:47:52,831 --> 00:47:54,111
But Alex's misreporting

886
00:47:56,927 --> 00:47:57,439
Thomas dunk

887
00:47:57,695 --> 00:48:00,511
Can arrive at the Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital complaint

888
00:48:01,023 --> 00:48:03,071
A fever abdominal pain dizziness and nausea

889
00:48:03,583 --> 00:48:05,375
You spiking a fever at a tire

890
00:48:05,631 --> 00:48:06,655
Set times of 100

891
00:48:06,911 --> 00:48:11,519
3 degrees number of tests on him and couldn't figure out what was wrong

892
00:48:11,775 --> 00:48:14,847
They kept him overnight but they didn't diagnose him with a virus at all

893
00:48:15,103 --> 00:48:17,407
Broad-spectrum antibiotic

894
00:48:19,967 --> 00:48:22,783
The initial symptoms of Ebola are super common

895
00:48:23,039 --> 00:48:29,183
Like nausea dizziness abdominal fever differential diagnosis

896
00:48:29,439 --> 00:48:30,463
That goes into

897
00:48:30,719 --> 00:48:36,863
So many different possible actual underlying conditions

898
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:38,655
Ebola is like your left

899
00:48:38,911 --> 00:48:45,055
Hand turns in the exact opposite direction.

900
00:48:45,567 --> 00:48:46,335
There's not there's not

901
00:48:46,591 --> 00:48:48,895
Especially with the initial presentation of it

902
00:48:49,151 --> 00:48:50,687
Which is one of the reasons why it's so damn

903
00:48:51,199 --> 00:48:54,783
Is it the initial presentation is so similar to benign

904
00:48:55,039 --> 00:48:55,807
Condition

905
00:48:56,063 --> 00:49:02,207
Flew their brain suspicion that he has

906
00:49:02,463 --> 00:49:04,255
Ebola

907
00:49:04,511 --> 00:49:05,535
It wasn't an episode of House

908
00:49:07,327 --> 00:49:11,935
Return to the ER this time ambulance

909
00:49:12,191 --> 00:49:16,031
Together in

910
00:49:16,287 --> 00:49:18,079
Ebola risk in contact

911
00:49:19,615 --> 00:49:20,383
One important things

912
00:49:20,639 --> 00:49:21,919
Remember is the timeline of that

913
00:49:22,431 --> 00:49:22,943
The outbreak

914
00:49:23,199 --> 00:49:23,967
Jimmy happened

915
00:49:24,223 --> 00:49:25,247
In early 2014

916
00:49:25,503 --> 00:49:27,295
First being declared on March 23rd

917
00:49:27,807 --> 00:49:30,623
That with the condition spreading to Liberia and Sierra Leone

918
00:49:31,903 --> 00:49:32,927
Liberia go on

919
00:49:33,183 --> 00:49:34,463
Speedy hottest Zone event

920
00:49:34,719 --> 00:49:35,487
And initially

921
00:49:35,743 --> 00:49:37,791
The country was declared Ebola Free by May

922
00:49:38,303 --> 00:49:38,815
Now

923
00:49:39,071 --> 00:49:43,167
It would reappear and it wasn't fully taken care of again like I said until January

924
00:49:43,679 --> 00:49:48,287
But the fact that in may they declared Liberia Ebola Free

925
00:49:48,799 --> 00:49:50,591
Kind of made the crisis beam less press

926
00:49:50,847 --> 00:49:54,175
So in September these nurses probably didn't have Ebola first

927
00:49:54,431 --> 00:49:55,455
Been foremost on their mind

928
00:49:55,967 --> 00:49:56,991
You wish they would have

929
00:49:57,503 --> 00:49:59,551
But it also makes no sense why they would have slept

930
00:49:59,807 --> 00:50:02,111
Cracks the first time he shows up at the hospital

931
00:50:02,367 --> 00:50:04,671
Horse. However what happens after that

932
00:50:05,183 --> 00:50:05,951
Is

933
00:50:06,719 --> 00:50:07,999
Definitely deserving of some

934
00:50:09,023 --> 00:50:10,047
I mention there's some pretty

935
00:50:10,303 --> 00:50:11,327
Here's some of it

936
00:50:11,839 --> 00:50:13,887
The nurses Union is come out

937
00:50:14,143 --> 00:50:15,167
Complaints the protocol was

938
00:50:15,423 --> 00:50:16,447
Handled as well as it could have

939
00:50:16,959 --> 00:50:20,543
Ranging from not immediately isolating Duncan is a suspect

940
00:50:20,799 --> 00:50:23,359
Confirmation

941
00:50:23,871 --> 00:50:27,199
Suspicions do not require staff to treat him in hazmat suit

942
00:50:27,455 --> 00:50:28,991
But instead of just gloves mask

943
00:50:29,247 --> 00:50:29,759
Good eye protection

944
00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:32,575
Duncan stats rebola comes back positive

945
00:50:32,831 --> 00:50:33,855
On September 30th

946
00:50:34,367 --> 00:50:36,927
And the day before a nurse named Nina Pham

947
00:50:37,183 --> 00:50:38,975
Him without any protective

948
00:50:39,487 --> 00:50:42,815
A joy Simpson another nurse

949
00:50:43,071 --> 00:50:44,351
Retreat at Dunkin

950
00:50:44,607 --> 00:50:50,239
Compositive freebola survive. Up and up spreading it to anybody else

951
00:50:50,495 --> 00:50:53,823
It is a really great place

952
00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:56,383
To start your criticism

953
00:50:56,639 --> 00:50:57,407
This situation

954
00:50:57,663 --> 00:51:00,735
Because there are very valid criticisms about the

955
00:51:00,991 --> 00:51:02,015
Handled

956
00:51:02,271 --> 00:51:03,807
But the ones that Alex chooses to

957
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:04,831
Arnot

958
00:51:05,087 --> 00:51:07,135
Also paint

959
00:51:07,391 --> 00:51:08,415
Pictures that he wants

960
00:51:08,671 --> 00:51:12,767
If you suspect somebody of having a bowl that you don't let him nurse go in with me

961
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:16,351
Yeah let me terrible idea

962
00:51:16,607 --> 00:51:17,375
At the very least

963
00:51:17,631 --> 00:51:20,959
At the very least I can't imagine anybody Direct

964
00:51:21,215 --> 00:51:23,263
Nina Pham to go in there without any pro

965
00:51:25,567 --> 00:51:26,591
Physician was like hey

966
00:51:27,103 --> 00:51:31,711
Good old day

967
00:51:33,503 --> 00:51:34,783
Is it like a piece of

968
00:51:36,063 --> 00:51:37,855
Furniture

969
00:51:39,903 --> 00:51:44,511
Nurses have a pretty good union like that would absolutely be a lawsuit it seems like

970
00:51:45,279 --> 00:51:47,071
It seems like some failures

971
00:51:47,839 --> 00:51:51,423
Situationally in this particular Hospital definitely

972
00:51:51,679 --> 00:51:54,495
Oversight

973
00:51:55,775 --> 00:51:59,615
Not any kind of malicious and probably could be

974
00:51:59,871 --> 00:52:02,175
Easily traced back to the idea that most of these

975
00:52:02,431 --> 00:52:03,967
People involved probably never imagined

976
00:52:05,759 --> 00:52:07,295
Who would have

977
00:52:08,575 --> 00:52:09,855
Crazy

978
00:52:10,623 --> 00:52:13,951
So I want to say one thing or just

979
00:52:14,463 --> 00:52:15,743
Perfectly fair to Al

980
00:52:16,767 --> 00:52:18,303
The some of this information that I'm talking

981
00:52:19,583 --> 00:52:20,095
After this

982
00:52:21,887 --> 00:52:22,911
This is on October 5th

983
00:52:26,495 --> 00:52:27,519
End up texting

984
00:52:28,031 --> 00:52:29,823
Positive until

985
00:52:30,847 --> 00:52:31,615
October 12th

986
00:52:32,127 --> 00:52:33,407
That's when she tested positive

987
00:52:34,687 --> 00:52:35,711
The 3rd

988
00:52:35,967 --> 00:52:36,479
Miss Vincent

989
00:52:36,991 --> 00:52:37,759
Isn't until October

990
00:52:38,783 --> 00:52:40,575
He doesn't know any

991
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:42,879
Which are the actual

992
00:52:43,135 --> 00:52:43,903
Decent criticism

993
00:52:46,719 --> 00:52:48,511
But I also stand behind

994
00:52:48,767 --> 00:52:52,863
Only make

995
00:53:00,287 --> 00:53:06,431
Any more realistic exact but I just want to give that caveat that he has no reason to know

996
00:53:06,687 --> 00:53:07,199
That's tough being

997
00:53:07,455 --> 00:53:09,247
Future

998
00:53:09,759 --> 00:53:13,855
Inexplicably we are as Fair as humanly possible

999
00:53:14,111 --> 00:53:17,183
Listeners to others think

1000
00:53:17,439 --> 00:53:21,023
The timeline of unnecessary

1001
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:27,423
The ambulance was

1002
00:53:29,471 --> 00:53:29,983
Who dealt with him

1003
00:53:30,239 --> 00:53:30,751
Word

1004
00:53:31,263 --> 00:53:31,775
Quarantine

1005
00:53:33,823 --> 00:53:34,335
Kept track of

1006
00:53:36,127 --> 00:53:36,639
The

1007
00:53:37,151 --> 00:53:37,663
He wasn't

1008
00:53:38,175 --> 00:53:42,015
Give a didn't but he was given broad-spectrum antibiotics

1009
00:53:42,271 --> 00:53:42,783
Because they couldn't

1010
00:53:43,039 --> 00:53:43,551
Figure out what he

1011
00:53:44,063 --> 00:53:44,831
Automatic kind of

1012
00:53:45,343 --> 00:53:50,975
Catch a biotic resistant thing

1013
00:53:52,767 --> 00:53:56,607
What percent of cases are solved

1014
00:53:56,863 --> 00:53:57,631
Or or at least

1015
00:53:57,887 --> 00:53:59,935
Treatable by doing this

1016
00:54:00,703 --> 00:54:02,239
Your first instinct is going

1017
00:54:02,495 --> 00:54:06,335
Let's do this thing that helps nine out of ten people not like

1018
00:54:07,103 --> 00:54:11,199
Almost never hurts

1019
00:54:11,455 --> 00:54:15,807
Yeah except for the resistance

1020
00:54:16,831 --> 00:54:17,599
All this is

1021
00:54:17,855 --> 00:54:18,367
Is a bunch

1022
00:54:18,623 --> 00:54:19,135
Bulshit

1023
00:54:19,903 --> 00:54:20,671
By and large

1024
00:54:21,183 --> 00:54:23,487
And without to take on the bigger

1025
00:54:24,767 --> 00:54:26,559
I want to make this very clear

1026
00:54:27,839 --> 00:54:28,607
They either

1027
00:54:47,551 --> 00:54:51,391
And what's already happened

1028
00:54:51,647 --> 00:54:53,439
How does MSNBC respond

1029
00:55:00,863 --> 00:55:04,191
Metaphor

1030
00:55:04,447 --> 00:55:06,751
What would you blame the moon made of cheese

1031
00:55:07,007 --> 00:55:12,639
I would like to ignore everything else you said because it's just it's Obama's fault

1032
00:55:12,895 --> 00:55:14,431
So the NRA

1033
00:55:15,199 --> 00:55:16,735
Making Ebola crisis

1034
00:55:17,247 --> 00:55:17,759
Is the headline

1035
00:55:18,015 --> 00:55:21,087
Yeah Alex

1036
00:55:21,599 --> 00:55:22,623
Yes and that

1037
00:55:22,879 --> 00:55:24,927
Specifically the NRA there

1038
00:55:25,183 --> 00:55:28,767
All gunners

1039
00:55:29,279 --> 00:55:33,631
But the way he's presenting it is they're blaming gun owners were making the Ebola crisis worse

1040
00:55:34,143 --> 00:55:37,215
Which is similar to blaming the moon made of cheese

1041
00:55:38,495 --> 00:55:43,103
I don't I think he had more to say when he got cut off by a heartbreak

1042
00:55:43,359 --> 00:55:44,383
Or you just

1043
00:55:44,639 --> 00:55:49,247
That's him Stephen

1044
00:55:49,503 --> 00:55:53,599
I got nowhere to go

1045
00:55:54,111 --> 00:55:55,391
So does he

1046
00:55:55,647 --> 00:55:57,951
Blaming the NRA

1047
00:55:58,207 --> 00:55:58,975
Is similar to

1048
00:55:59,231 --> 00:56:00,511
You blaming the Moon

1049
00:56:01,279 --> 00:56:02,047
Made of cheese

1050
00:56:02,303 --> 00:56:05,119
As opposed to blaming just the moon for Ebola

1051
00:56:05,887 --> 00:56:10,495
You're blaming the moon made of cheese for another

1052
00:56:11,007 --> 00:56:17,151
I would say that it's equally ridiculous

1053
00:56:17,663 --> 00:56:18,175
That I

1054
00:56:18,431 --> 00:56:19,967
I don't think that's what he was saying

1055
00:56:20,223 --> 00:56:21,759
He was trying to make some simile about

1056
00:56:23,807 --> 00:56:29,951
I don't know I don't I don't know I don't understand this is one of these trademark moments with Alex

1057
00:56:31,743 --> 00:56:33,535
I wish I could have talked to him during the break

1058
00:56:33,791 --> 00:56:39,935
What is the name Kim now there's no way he remembers when he

1059
00:56:40,191 --> 00:56:40,703
I want to know

1060
00:56:41,215 --> 00:56:43,007
I don't know if you would remember what

1061
00:56:43,519 --> 00:56:45,823
Immediately

1062
00:56:46,079 --> 00:56:47,871
You got to tell those kids you can't go fishing again

1063
00:56:48,383 --> 00:56:51,199
He's blaming the Moon

1064
00:56:51,711 --> 00:56:56,319
Listen kids I know you want to catch some trout like the moon made of cheese

1065
00:56:56,831 --> 00:57:01,439
Doctors kids on the phone he has hard brakes

1066
00:57:01,695 --> 00:57:07,839
He calls up

1067
00:57:08,095 --> 00:57:09,375
Back tone

1068
00:57:09,631 --> 00:57:12,959
Whatever Whenever you decide to get off the phone

1069
00:57:13,215 --> 00:57:15,007
Whenever it's time to get off

1070
00:57:16,287 --> 00:57:17,823
Block Rockin Beats

1071
00:57:19,359 --> 00:57:20,639
Bow

1072
00:57:22,431 --> 00:57:23,711
Circuits got to go

1073
00:57:23,967 --> 00:57:24,735
About about

1074
00:57:26,783 --> 00:57:27,807
So

1075
00:57:28,063 --> 00:57:30,879
There's a guy Thomas Breeden who's the head of the

1076
00:57:33,439 --> 00:57:33,951
He came out

1077
00:57:34,975 --> 00:57:35,487
Comment

1078
00:57:35,743 --> 00:57:36,511
About how

1079
00:57:36,767 --> 00:57:39,071
We talked about this already a little bit

1080
00:57:39,327 --> 00:57:41,631
These bands don't work

1081
00:57:41,887 --> 00:57:43,935
Explains the closing borders isn't

1082
00:57:44,191 --> 00:57:45,727
Really a viable option

1083
00:57:45,983 --> 00:57:48,031
Alex plays the Clippers

1084
00:57:48,287 --> 00:57:50,335
Describe Alex's

1085
00:57:50,591 --> 00:57:51,103
Responses

1086
00:57:51,359 --> 00:57:52,383
Like this guy's an a******

1087
00:57:53,151 --> 00:57:54,687
What does the CDC director

1088
00:57:54,943 --> 00:58:01,087
We can't control the outbreak

1089
00:58:01,343 --> 00:58:07,487
Even if we tried the closed

1090
00:58:07,743 --> 00:58:13,887
Dwarf people have a right to return people transiting to

1091
00:58:24,895 --> 00:58:30,527
Very convincing

1092
00:58:46,143 --> 00:58:46,911
Truly love you

1093
00:58:47,167 --> 00:58:48,959
I love mobile

1094
00:58:49,215 --> 00:58:52,031
Real that is musical playing over that message

1095
00:58:54,591 --> 00:58:56,383
So what

1096
00:58:56,639 --> 00:58:58,175
You at us.

1097
00:58:58,431 --> 00:59:01,503
I know we've been doing this for so long

1098
00:59:02,783 --> 00:59:03,551
Imagine

1099
00:59:04,831 --> 00:59:06,367
People at the CDC

1100
00:59:06,623 --> 00:59:07,391
Actually

1101
00:59:07,647 --> 00:59:08,159
Being like

1102
00:59:08,671 --> 00:59:10,719
We want your kids to be healthy

1103
00:59:11,231 --> 00:59:11,743
Black Widow

1104
00:59:11,999 --> 00:59:13,279
No with no

1105
00:59:13,535 --> 00:59:14,047
Caveat

1106
00:59:14,303 --> 00:59:15,327
With no like

1107
00:59:15,583 --> 00:59:18,143
Like it's literally good job

1108
00:59:20,959 --> 00:59:21,983
To be healthy

1109
00:59:22,495 --> 00:59:24,799
For a second imagine

1110
00:59:25,055 --> 00:59:25,567
Real

1111
00:59:26,335 --> 00:59:29,407
Like not even for one moment

1112
00:59:30,943 --> 00:59:33,759
Controlling the Center for Disease freedom

1113
00:59:34,015 --> 00:59:35,039
I believe

1114
00:59:35,295 --> 00:59:39,391
Of course not

1115
00:59:44,767 --> 00:59:45,535
Is good

1116
00:59:45,791 --> 00:59:46,815
There was a Mercury based

1117
00:59:47,071 --> 00:59:47,583
Preservative

1118
00:59:47,839 --> 00:59:49,631
Marisol

1119
00:59:50,399 --> 00:59:51,935
I am.

1120
00:59:52,191 --> 00:59:53,215
The things that was targeted

1121
00:59:53,471 --> 00:59:54,751
Specifically about the idea

1122
00:59:55,007 --> 00:59:55,775
Cause

1123
00:59:56,031 --> 00:59:56,543
Able to be on the altar

1124
00:59:57,055 --> 00:59:59,359
Right right right

1125
00:59:59,871 --> 01:00:00,895
A scientific

1126
01:00:01,151 --> 01:00:04,479
It's all completely refuted by study as always

1127
01:00:06,527 --> 01:00:07,295
Love you so much

1128
01:00:07,551 --> 01:00:08,319
Richard Wright

1129
01:00:08,831 --> 01:00:09,855
Mercury they love giving

1130
01:00:10,111 --> 01:00:14,975
Mercury Mercury

1131
01:00:15,231 --> 01:00:15,999
Resume

1132
01:00:16,511 --> 01:00:17,535
Like what is he won

1133
01:00:17,791 --> 01:00:21,375
So okay so his criticism is we have an NPR voice

1134
01:00:21,631 --> 01:00:22,655
On there

1135
01:00:23,167 --> 01:00:25,727
I would like it if I CDC head

1136
01:00:25,983 --> 01:00:27,519
Didn't come out and say

1137
01:00:30,847 --> 01:00:33,407
Third Beyond inspired

1138
01:00:33,663 --> 01:00:34,687
No no

1139
01:00:36,991 --> 01:00:40,575
I guess so yeah I guess he wants people who have a little bit of a cup

1140
01:00:41,087 --> 01:00:41,855
Replying to them

1141
01:00:42,623 --> 01:00:48,767
Like that people from these other countries are going to

1142
01:00:51,071 --> 01:00:53,887
Who's the Boss

1143
01:00:54,143 --> 01:00:55,679
Like snobby liberal

1144
01:00:55,935 --> 01:01:00,031
Or whatever that is responding to

1145
01:01:00,287 --> 01:01:04,383
What radio liberals like to listen to that sound

1146
01:01:04,639 --> 01:01:06,431
Speech pattern or whatever

1147
01:01:06,687 --> 01:01:07,455
Vocal fry

1148
01:01:08,735 --> 01:01:14,623
8600 total cases

1149
01:01:14,879 --> 01:01:15,391
Is over the

1150
01:01:15,647 --> 01:01:16,927
Tires 2 year span

1151
01:01:17,183 --> 01:01:19,231
Of this outbreak

1152
01:01:20,511 --> 01:01:22,303
It did did not get outside of

1153
01:01:22,559 --> 01:01:23,071
Dallas

1154
01:01:23,327 --> 01:01:24,095
At least this

1155
01:01:24,607 --> 01:01:25,119
The distance

1156
01:01:27,423 --> 01:01:29,727
It isn't

1157
01:01:29,983 --> 01:01:31,007
Incredibly irresponsible

1158
01:01:31,263 --> 01:01:32,031
Create

1159
01:01:32,543 --> 01:01:33,311
Things are way worse than

1160
01:01:33,567 --> 01:01:34,079
They are

1161
01:02:09,151 --> 01:02:10,175
That's irresponsible

1162
01:02:10,431 --> 01:02:15,295
So loud

1163
01:02:16,319 --> 01:02:21,183
My cat seems a little louder than a lot of his regular like coming back from break music

1164
01:02:21,439 --> 01:02:23,743
He just lingers

1165
01:02:24,511 --> 01:02:27,071
Anytime anybody play ZZ Top

1166
01:02:27,327 --> 01:02:27,839
I got problems

1167
01:02:28,863 --> 01:02:29,631
I've got

1168
01:02:30,655 --> 01:02:33,215
The bad bad cuz beard

1169
01:02:33,471 --> 01:02:37,055
It's not the beard jealousy so much I don't like the idea of people making beard novelty

1170
01:02:37,311 --> 01:02:38,591
She's certainly I don't like

1171
01:02:38,847 --> 01:02:41,919
Like in college civil rights issue

1172
01:02:42,175 --> 01:02:44,735
In college I would always get like a people

1173
01:02:44,991 --> 01:02:45,503
Every

1174
01:02:47,551 --> 01:02:48,063
These updates about the

1175
01:02:48,319 --> 01:02:49,343
The beard and mustache champ

1176
01:02:51,391 --> 01:02:54,463
Otu spaghetti

1177
01:02:54,975 --> 01:03:01,119
This would interest you of course you bearded man

1178
01:03:01,631 --> 01:03:03,167
Primary

1179
01:03:03,423 --> 01:03:04,959
My primary problems are songs

1180
01:03:05,215 --> 01:03:08,543
F****** terrible I realize they're like

1181
01:03:08,799 --> 01:03:09,823
I want hundred percent

1182
01:03:10,079 --> 01:03:11,871
Hold that clip because I think it's your spot

1183
01:03:12,383 --> 01:03:12,895
Sensationalism

1184
01:03:13,151 --> 01:03:18,527
But I also because

1185
01:03:18,783 --> 01:03:21,599
Played it too loud really was like

1186
01:03:21,855 --> 01:03:25,183
Most of his music papers off as soon as he starts talking

1187
01:03:25,439 --> 01:03:31,583
That was loud as f*** it Loosely fascinated by where your boundaries are drawn with music

1188
01:03:33,631 --> 01:03:34,143
You know I think

1189
01:03:34,399 --> 01:03:35,679
I think you've got pretty

1190
01:03:36,191 --> 01:03:37,727
Decent

1191
01:03:37,983 --> 01:03:39,007
About what

1192
01:03:39,263 --> 01:03:39,775
Narrative about

1193
01:03:41,055 --> 01:03:47,199
Like the idea behind it, and the federal government

1194
01:03:47,455 --> 01:03:47,967
Intentional

1195
01:03:48,735 --> 01:03:49,247
Blue baby blue

1196
01:03:49,503 --> 01:03:51,295
But in this ex-wife

1197
01:03:51,551 --> 01:03:52,319
Makes

1198
01:03:53,855 --> 01:03:54,879
The clear

1199
01:03:55,135 --> 01:03:55,647
Is going on

1200
01:03:56,159 --> 01:04:02,303
Basically use this crisis

1201
01:04:11,007 --> 01:04:12,799
Jerry Diaz

1202
01:04:13,055 --> 01:04:16,639
Bare minimum

1203
01:04:21,503 --> 01:04:24,575
Pressurizing a jumbo jet

1204
01:04:25,087 --> 01:04:29,439
He doesn't really make it clear what do you think they're about these like not closing the hatch

1205
01:04:29,695 --> 01:04:31,999
And stuff like that

1206
01:04:32,255 --> 01:04:37,119
Rinaldi's clarify is not

1207
01:04:37,375 --> 01:04:38,143
Because I didn't

1208
01:04:38,911 --> 01:04:39,679
Did you order

1209
01:04:40,191 --> 01:04:41,983
It's because when I first listened

1210
01:04:42,239 --> 01:04:43,007
Intuit I felt like

1211
01:04:43,263 --> 01:04:44,543
He's not being clear at all

1212
01:04:48,127 --> 01:04:50,431
From Houston International

1213
01:04:51,711 --> 01:04:54,015
Turn off all the default

1214
01:04:54,271 --> 01:04:56,319
Because the public

1215
01:04:56,575 --> 01:04:59,391
More like 187

1216
01:05:02,719 --> 01:05:04,767
Gone this whole thing

1217
01:05:05,023 --> 01:05:05,791
Generally speaking

1218
01:05:06,047 --> 01:05:07,327
Is the idea that

1219
01:05:08,095 --> 01:05:10,399
Is a false flag

1220
01:05:10,655 --> 01:05:13,471
H

1221
01:05:13,727 --> 01:05:17,055
For the global false flag

1222
01:05:17,311 --> 01:05:18,335
Dip dip

1223
01:05:19,615 --> 01:05:20,127
Case

1224
01:05:20,383 --> 01:05:21,151
It's not

1225
01:05:21,663 --> 01:05:23,967
Or whatever you can

1226
01:05:24,223 --> 01:05:27,039
But the ideas globalist

1227
01:05:27,807 --> 01:05:30,879
Have created this or are letting this happen

1228
01:05:31,135 --> 01:05:37,279
In order to get us all mandatory vaccinated with a

1229
01:05:37,535 --> 01:05:42,143
Monsanto and Gates Foundation are working together to enforce Upon a

1230
01:05:42,399 --> 01:05:47,775
I don't want to talk

1231
01:05:48,031 --> 01:05:49,055
Give me any

1232
01:05:49,567 --> 01:05:51,615
Situation where Monsanto and the billing

1233
01:05:54,175 --> 01:05:56,223
I can't give you one but I can save it

1234
01:05:57,759 --> 01:05:58,783
Vaccine

1235
01:05:59,039 --> 01:06:00,575
A ebola did not

1236
01:06:00,831 --> 01:06:01,343
Come out of this

1237
01:06:02,623 --> 01:06:03,903
Anyone

1238
01:06:04,159 --> 01:06:06,975
Couple recently

1239
01:06:07,487 --> 01:06:08,511
I'm not sure if

1240
01:06:08,767 --> 01:06:14,143
But a couple of

1241
01:06:15,167 --> 01:06:16,447
Insane

1242
01:06:17,727 --> 01:06:18,751
Through

1243
01:06:19,007 --> 01:06:21,823
3 and the FDA

1244
01:06:22,335 --> 01:06:25,919
I'm not sure I'm not sure I was trying to look into it and I can't

1245
01:06:26,175 --> 01:06:29,759
I was reading a bunch of documents

1246
01:06:31,551 --> 01:06:34,623
After a bunch of testing there are a couple of EX

1247
01:06:35,135 --> 01:06:36,671
In 2016 that were shown

1248
01:06:37,439 --> 01:06:37,951
Affect

1249
01:06:38,207 --> 01:06:39,999
In the range of 70

1250
01:06:40,255 --> 01:06:41,279
200% of 2

1251
01:06:42,303 --> 01:06:44,607
Being of XP

1252
01:06:45,119 --> 01:06:46,143
Which branch

1253
01:06:48,959 --> 01:06:51,775
But

1254
01:06:52,031 --> 01:06:52,799
Pretty good

1255
01:06:53,823 --> 01:06:55,359
From what I could tell

1256
01:06:55,615 --> 01:06:57,407
It didn't seem like it was on the market

1257
01:06:59,455 --> 01:07:05,599
Quesadillas

1258
01:07:05,855 --> 01:07:06,367
Is effective

1259
01:07:06,879 --> 01:07:09,439
And on the market and approved and all that stuff yeah

1260
01:07:09,695 --> 01:07:11,743
It doesn't really matter because

1261
01:07:12,255 --> 01:07:12,767
You know

1262
01:07:13,279 --> 01:07:14,303
This entire

1263
01:07:14,815 --> 01:07:15,839
Segments of our history

1264
01:07:16,095 --> 01:07:16,863
Entire outbreak

1265
01:07:17,375 --> 01:07:17,887
Ebola

1266
01:07:18,143 --> 01:07:18,655
West Africa

1267
01:07:19,167 --> 01:07:20,191
Didn't end.

1268
01:07:20,447 --> 01:07:20,959
Precipitating

1269
01:07:21,471 --> 01:07:24,031
Navigate didn't end up leading to a crisis that were

1270
01:07:24,287 --> 01:07:25,311
Required mandatory

1271
01:07:27,615 --> 01:07:29,407
Through of this vaccine that the globalist

1272
01:07:29,663 --> 01:07:30,687
Just going to use to

1273
01:07:31,711 --> 01:07:34,015
Kill-men I guess I don't know

1274
01:07:34,271 --> 01:07:35,551
This narrative is

1275
01:07:36,831 --> 01:07:37,343
A bump

1276
01:07:40,415 --> 01:07:40,927
I agree

1277
01:07:43,231 --> 01:07:43,999
Probably been

1278
01:07:45,023 --> 01:07:45,535
What have I

1279
01:07:46,047 --> 01:07:47,839
NRA store

1280
01:07:48,095 --> 01:07:50,911
Wonder what that NRA story was all about

1281
01:07:51,167 --> 01:07:53,727
I'm going to go with here's my

1282
01:07:53,983 --> 01:07:55,519
Prediction on what the NRA

1283
01:07:57,823 --> 01:08:00,127
I want to tell you before you make this prediction

1284
01:08:00,383 --> 01:08:01,407
To hear it but

1285
01:08:01,663 --> 01:08:02,687
You're going to be wrong

1286
01:08:03,711 --> 01:08:06,015
I'm going to give I'm going to give this one a go

1287
01:08:06,527 --> 01:08:07,039
Alright

1288
01:08:07,295 --> 01:08:08,575
So the NRA

1289
01:08:09,087 --> 01:08:09,599
Is making

1290
01:08:09,855 --> 01:08:10,879
Ebola crisis

1291
01:08:13,951 --> 01:08:14,463
Isis Wars

1292
01:08:14,719 --> 01:08:15,743
I'm going to go with

1293
01:08:15,999 --> 01:08:16,511
Rampant

1294
01:08:17,023 --> 01:08:23,167
AAA medicine and all of that stuff

1295
01:08:27,007 --> 01:08:27,775
You could predict what

1296
01:08:28,543 --> 01:08:32,127
Actually be about

1297
01:08:32,639 --> 01:08:36,991
A manta ray

1298
01:08:37,247 --> 01:08:38,015
Has a

1299
01:08:38,271 --> 01:08:39,551
Prosciutto

1300
01:08:40,063 --> 01:08:41,343
You know I hate bees

1301
01:08:41,599 --> 01:08:42,367
Is much like

1302
01:08:46,719 --> 01:08:52,351
Yeah just take out bees

1303
01:08:52,863 --> 01:08:53,887
Jordan

1304
01:08:54,143 --> 01:08:54,655
B you're wrong

1305
01:08:55,679 --> 01:09:00,799
You have said that you're wrong about this NRA story

1306
01:09:01,055 --> 01:09:02,847
At the beginning you could predict

1307
01:09:03,871 --> 01:09:04,383
It's a real

1308
01:09:04,639 --> 01:09:05,407
Good point

1309
01:09:06,175 --> 01:09:06,687
And Alex

1310
01:09:07,199 --> 01:09:07,967
Has not read this article

1311
01:09:16,159 --> 01:09:20,767
You don't even know what gaslighting

1312
01:09:23,071 --> 01:09:24,095
Crystal ball

1313
01:09:25,631 --> 01:09:28,191
I want Falls there real quick that is her real name

1314
01:09:28,447 --> 01:09:34,591
Okay

1315
01:09:34,847 --> 01:09:40,479
Real person's name

1316
01:09:40,735 --> 01:09:45,599
Vice

1317
01:09:53,535 --> 01:09:54,815
Is the problem

1318
01:10:00,959 --> 01:10:02,239
They don't even give a reason

1319
01:10:04,799 --> 01:10:06,847
That sound right

1320
01:10:08,127 --> 01:10:08,895
Two people

1321
01:10:09,151 --> 01:10:09,663
Together

1322
01:10:09,919 --> 01:10:10,431
Bothering

1323
01:10:11,455 --> 01:10:12,223
Crystal ball

1324
01:10:12,479 --> 01:10:12,991
Open Amazon

1325
01:10:13,503 --> 01:10:14,783
Are not going to need some

1326
01:10:15,039 --> 01:10:15,807
Are not just going

1327
01:10:16,063 --> 01:10:18,623
To say something and then not give

1328
01:10:19,391 --> 01:10:22,207
We're going to MSNBC it's just basically like some guys

1329
01:10:22,463 --> 01:10:22,975
His blog

1330
01:10:23,231 --> 01:10:29,375
11

1331
01:10:29,631 --> 01:10:33,727
The NRA's makes Ebola crisis

1332
01:10:35,007 --> 01:10:35,775
Even talk about what

1333
01:10:36,031 --> 01:10:36,799
Is in the article

1334
01:10:37,055 --> 01:10:39,103
Bring instead just say things like they do

1335
01:10:39,359 --> 01:10:39,871
Make a point

1336
01:10:40,127 --> 01:10:40,639
It's bizarre

1337
01:10:40,895 --> 01:10:41,663
That's what you just said

1338
01:10:43,967 --> 01:10:44,479
True

1339
01:10:44,991 --> 01:10:46,271
At is bizarre

1340
01:10:46,783 --> 01:10:47,807
It would be bizarre

1341
01:10:48,063 --> 01:10:48,575
It would be bizarre

1342
01:10:48,831 --> 01:10:53,695
Do the clearance willful defeat because he knows his listeners will hear the headline

1343
01:10:53,951 --> 01:10:57,279
I'm taking some kind of dumb liberal bulshit

1344
01:10:57,791 --> 01:10:58,303
Problems

1345
01:10:59,071 --> 01:11:03,423
The reason these writers are suggesting that the NRA is responsible for making crisis worth

1346
01:11:03,679 --> 01:11:04,703
Goes like this

1347
01:11:05,471 --> 01:11:08,543
Experts and researchers had examined the US infrastructure

1348
01:11:08,799 --> 01:11:10,079
Found that there is little

1349
01:11:10,335 --> 01:11:13,407
No reason for people to worry about a breakout of Ebola happen

1350
01:11:14,175 --> 01:11:14,943
Because

1351
01:11:15,199 --> 01:11:15,967
All containment

1352
01:11:16,223 --> 01:11:16,991
Processes that we

1353
01:11:17,503 --> 01:11:18,015
Because of

1354
01:11:19,807 --> 01:11:22,111
It just is on Roku

1355
01:11:22,623 --> 01:11:23,647
Like even if

1356
01:11:23,903 --> 01:11:24,415
People

1357
01:11:24,671 --> 01:11:27,487
Do end up showing up here

1358
01:11:27,743 --> 01:11:29,279
The proof of the pudding is in the eating

1359
01:11:29,535 --> 01:11:35,679
It didn't end up becoming a pandemic we have a solid infrastructure in place

1360
01:11:37,471 --> 01:11:37,983
Before it

1361
01:11:38,239 --> 01:11:43,871
Becoming a problem

1362
01:11:44,127 --> 01:11:44,639
Is obs

1363
01:11:44,895 --> 01:11:45,663
Bingo Bongo

1364
01:11:47,967 --> 01:11:51,039
However there a hard time conveying that message

1365
01:11:51,295 --> 01:11:51,807
Publix

1366
01:11:52,063 --> 01:11:55,135
Particularly with the backdrop of a meteorite

1367
01:11:55,391 --> 01:11:58,975
Worried about break and how is Eminem

1368
01:11:59,999 --> 01:12:02,303
Historically the job of conveying important health

1369
01:12:02,559 --> 01:12:03,583
Information like this

1370
01:12:03,839 --> 01:12:05,119
And reassuring population

1371
01:12:05,631 --> 01:12:09,215
They're being sold on air on

1372
01:12:09,983 --> 01:12:11,775
That is one of the main rules of the

1373
01:12:12,031 --> 01:12:13,055
Position of the surgeon

1374
01:12:14,079 --> 01:12:16,383
However in 2014 with the Ebola crisis

1375
01:12:16,639 --> 01:12:17,663
Heating up

1376
01:12:17,919 --> 01:12:18,431
Have a surgery

1377
01:12:18,687 --> 01:12:19,711
General

1378
01:12:19,967 --> 01:12:20,479
For about a year

1379
01:12:21,247 --> 01:12:22,527
In November

1380
01:12:22,783 --> 01:12:26,367
Obama nominated dr. Vivek Murthy for the Post

1381
01:12:26,623 --> 01:12:32,767
But his domination had been held hostage by the republican-held Senate the reason

1382
01:12:33,279 --> 01:12:36,351
He believed the guns were a Public Health crisis

1383
01:12:36,607 --> 01:12:39,935
And exhaust the NRA lobbied strongly against his nomination

1384
01:12:40,191 --> 01:12:41,983
Receiving

1385
01:12:42,239 --> 01:12:48,383
In making sure his nomination didn't move forward at all

1386
01:12:48,639 --> 01:12:54,783
Totally remember the public anxiety about a potential outbreak have a top doctor in office

1387
01:12:55,039 --> 01:12:59,647
And literally the only reason is that he believed the guns led to health problems

1388
01:12:59,903 --> 01:13:02,207
And the NRA found that position unaccept

1389
01:13:02,719 --> 01:13:04,767
The NRA didn't bring Ebola in

1390
01:13:05,023 --> 01:13:05,535
Or anything like

1391
01:13:06,047 --> 01:13:07,327
But no matter how you slice it

1392
01:13:07,583 --> 01:13:10,399
Country General

1393
01:13:10,655 --> 01:13:11,679
Because of their lobbying

1394
01:13:11,935 --> 01:13:12,959
In Congress

1395
01:13:13,215 --> 01:13:14,495
Through the Republican Party

1396
01:13:14,751 --> 01:13:17,311
They absolutely made the Ebola crisis worse

1397
01:13:17,567 --> 01:13:23,455
It led to people being able to spread much more propaganda than they would have otherwise

1398
01:13:23,967 --> 01:13:28,319
The article makes perfect sense makes perfect

1399
01:13:28,575 --> 01:13:31,647
NRA made the Ebola crisis worse

1400
01:13:31,903 --> 01:13:35,999
I'd never thought about that I've never heard that article before but Alex's

1401
01:13:36,255 --> 01:13:38,303
Attack on it made me read

1402
01:13:38,559 --> 01:13:39,071
And I say

1403
01:13:39,327 --> 01:13:42,143
Good call Crystal Ball

1404
01:13:42,399 --> 01:13:46,751
Never as you correctly pointed out I would never have guessed

1405
01:13:48,031 --> 01:13:50,079
Now that I remember that whole situation

1406
01:13:50,335 --> 01:13:50,847
8 makes

1407
01:13:56,991 --> 01:13:58,527
It's another instance of

1408
01:13:58,783 --> 01:14:00,063
Corporate money having

1409
01:14:00,319 --> 01:14:05,695
Unintended consequences that are almost universally howls

1410
01:14:05,951 --> 01:14:07,743
So

1411
01:14:07,999 --> 01:14:09,023
Just talked about how the globalist

1412
01:14:09,279 --> 01:14:10,303
You want this to happen

1413
01:14:23,359 --> 01:14:26,431
And that's why I'm out there

1414
01:14:27,199 --> 01:14:29,759
The second hours a day

1415
01:14:34,367 --> 01:14:35,391
He still has no

1416
01:14:37,183 --> 01:14:37,951
48

1417
01:14:39,231 --> 01:14:40,767
The audience

1418
01:14:41,023 --> 01:14:42,047
To actually say

1419
01:14:44,095 --> 01:14:44,607
And then

1420
01:14:44,863 --> 01:14:46,655
After he has he knows the audience

1421
01:14:46,911 --> 01:14:47,679
Repeat it back

1422
01:14:49,215 --> 01:14:51,007
Little bit of fun

1423
01:14:52,287 --> 01:14:53,055
About the Ebola

1424
01:14:54,847 --> 01:15:00,991
In October 2014 a lawsuit against

1425
01:15:02,783 --> 01:15:04,575
And international terrorism

1426
01:15:04,831 --> 01:15:05,855
In facilitating

1427
01:15:06,111 --> 01:15:06,623
Terrorism

1428
01:15:07,135 --> 01:15:09,951
Larry believe that Obama intentionally brought Ebola into the

1429
01:15:10,719 --> 01:15:12,255
This is

1430
01:15:12,511 --> 01:15:13,023
Not good

1431
01:15:13,535 --> 01:15:19,679
Larry said Obama's reason for bringing Ebola and was that quote his African Brothers over the rest

1432
01:15:19,935 --> 01:15:22,751
BoBoiBoy

1433
01:15:23,007 --> 01:15:26,335
By allowing some free entry into this country

1434
01:15:26,591 --> 01:15:32,479
And others are not

1435
01:15:33,759 --> 01:15:37,343
It was just at becoming in Devious

1436
01:15:38,111 --> 01:15:40,927
Invidious form of reverse discrimination

1437
01:15:41,439 --> 01:15:42,719
He also said

1438
01:15:44,255 --> 01:15:46,047
True throughout Obama's illegitimate

1439
01:15:46,303 --> 01:15:48,095
Presidency

1440
01:15:48,351 --> 01:15:49,631
It suggests he was born in Kenya and

1441
01:15:49,887 --> 01:15:50,911
It is neither a natural born citizen

1442
01:15:51,167 --> 01:15:52,191
Ineligible to president

1443
01:15:52,447 --> 01:15:54,751
Nor has been naturalized

1444
01:15:55,263 --> 01:15:57,055
To even have the right to remain here

1445
01:15:57,311 --> 01:16:00,383
I received the deportation petition

1446
01:16:00,639 --> 01:16:03,711
Kelly files

1447
01:16:03,967 --> 01:16:06,271
Cheap is favored his own Creed over the rest

1448
01:16:07,807 --> 01:16:09,087
I know you're responding for the delay

1449
01:16:09,343 --> 01:16:10,623
But don't worry

1450
01:16:10,879 --> 01:16:11,903
Larry isn't crazy

1451
01:16:12,671 --> 01:16:17,535
He's very restrained

1452
01:16:17,791 --> 01:16:20,607
What's a restraint

1453
01:16:20,863 --> 01:16:21,631
I do not have to

1454
01:16:21,887 --> 01:16:28,031
Violence alive and deported

1455
01:16:29,823 --> 01:16:32,383
What

1456
01:16:36,479 --> 01:16:41,855
You want to beat that you want to be alive and pay for his inadequacies under the rule of law

1457
01:16:42,111 --> 01:16:44,671
This lawsuit that Larry klayman put into court

1458
01:16:46,463 --> 01:16:46,975
Embarrassing

1459
01:16:47,487 --> 01:16:48,767
Public spectacle of racism

1460
01:16:49,279 --> 01:16:50,047
Got thrown out of court

1461
01:16:53,887 --> 01:16:55,679
Where we found him

1462
01:16:56,191 --> 01:17:02,335
Creating the dentist Montgomery

1463
01:17:02,591 --> 01:17:03,103
Maricopa

1464
01:17:03,871 --> 01:17:09,759
He is one of these weird through lines that nobody knows about

1465
01:17:10,271 --> 01:17:12,319
Good part of this anti-obama sentiment

1466
01:17:12,831 --> 01:17:13,343
Yeah

1467
01:17:14,623 --> 01:17:18,719
Are things that are like

1468
01:17:19,743 --> 01:17:21,023
I'll be 90

1469
01:17:21,279 --> 01:17:21,791
You want

1470
01:17:22,559 --> 01:17:23,583
Yeah you're a lawyer

1471
01:17:24,351 --> 01:17:30,495
It's not clean that up white and others

1472
01:17:30,751 --> 01:17:32,287
We're not black Muslims to the back

1473
01:17:32,543 --> 01:17:33,055
Back of the bus

1474
01:17:34,335 --> 01:17:39,711
I know you think that's a great turn of phrase probably put like how do you not clean that up

1475
01:17:39,967 --> 01:17:41,759
So in this next clip

1476
01:17:42,783 --> 01:17:43,295
I've been

1477
01:17:43,807 --> 01:17:45,855
Sorta Vista

1478
01:17:46,111 --> 01:17:47,647
Leeside earlier that

1479
01:17:47,903 --> 01:17:48,927
Alex is saying that the

1480
01:17:49,183 --> 01:17:49,951
Ebola outbreak is a

1481
01:17:50,207 --> 01:17:50,719
The false flag

1482
01:17:54,559 --> 01:17:56,351
He actually believes that

1483
01:17:56,863 --> 01:17:58,911
A false-flag a staged event

1484
01:18:04,543 --> 01:18:06,079
False flag

1485
01:18:06,335 --> 01:18:08,383
Of course it is not surprised

1486
01:18:08,895 --> 01:18:09,919
Fight

1487
01:18:10,175 --> 01:18:11,711
One of the things I always wanted

1488
01:18:11,967 --> 01:18:12,735
Clearly

1489
01:18:14,527 --> 01:18:15,039
Make a point of

1490
01:18:15,295 --> 01:18:16,319
Is the idea that

1491
01:18:16,575 --> 01:18:17,855
Whatever Alex says

1492
01:18:18,367 --> 01:18:19,391
Izmir

1493
01:18:19,647 --> 01:18:20,927
Callers

1494
01:18:21,183 --> 01:18:22,719
About a half-hour after he says

1495
01:18:23,231 --> 01:18:23,743
He gets a caller

1496
01:18:30,655 --> 01:18:32,447
I think this is a false flag

1497
01:18:33,983 --> 01:18:36,287
Identify at least like Robert David

1498
01:18:36,543 --> 01:18:39,615
I need to work on your so on September 18th

1499
01:18:40,127 --> 01:18:45,503
It's sad that that that the next X-Files plans will be assimilated

1500
01:18:46,015 --> 01:18:48,575
She thinks it's a false flag

1501
01:18:48,831 --> 01:18:49,855
Cool whatever

1502
01:18:51,391 --> 01:18:52,671
Explanation for why

1503
01:18:53,183 --> 01:18:54,207
It's a false flag she's like

1504
01:18:54,463 --> 01:18:57,279
Robert David Steele was on your show and Stow

1505
01:18:58,047 --> 01:19:02,143
Eagle your listeners will remember that Robert David Steele was the guy who

1506
01:19:02,399 --> 01:19:04,703
Who was Maps

1507
01:19:04,959 --> 01:19:09,055
And take him to Mars bases

1508
01:19:09,311 --> 01:19:11,103
The white papers that made it pro

1509
01:19:11,359 --> 01:19:13,919
How much

1510
01:19:14,175 --> 01:19:16,223
Embarrassment never was like

1511
01:19:16,479 --> 01:19:18,527
Alex thinks people are on Mars bases

1512
01:19:18,783 --> 01:19:19,295
Itt

1513
01:19:20,319 --> 01:19:24,159
Pedialyte

1514
01:19:24,415 --> 01:19:26,207
It's because of Robert David Steele

1515
01:19:26,463 --> 01:19:29,279
Who is being brought up in 2014 as the person

1516
01:19:29,535 --> 01:19:30,815
Who predicted the

1517
01:19:32,607 --> 01:19:35,167
I do want to give it to Monique

1518
01:19:37,727 --> 01:19:39,007
She made me very

1519
01:19:39,263 --> 01:19:44,895
Justin her backstory so all-in-all Monique I don't know what's up with motor

1520
01:19:45,151 --> 01:19:50,015
Panda and because she thinks

1521
01:19:54,879 --> 01:19:57,951
How is it

1522
01:19:59,999 --> 01:20:00,767
I want another Baxter

1523
01:20:01,279 --> 01:20:02,815
I'll be honest no matter what resorts

1524
01:20:03,071 --> 01:20:03,839
I can do

1525
01:20:04,095 --> 01:20:05,119
I don't think I can solve that

1526
01:20:05,631 --> 01:20:08,959
Okay but what I can do

1527
01:20:09,471 --> 01:20:11,519
And then of course Lauren

1528
01:20:11,775 --> 01:20:12,287
From Ohio

1529
01:20:12,543 --> 01:20:15,872
Google Warren Ohio

1530
01:20:16,128 --> 01:20:17,152
Canada

1531
01:20:17,408 --> 01:20:17,920
Intend

1532
01:20:18,944 --> 01:20:21,760
I will get back to you on that

1533
01:20:22,272 --> 01:20:25,856
But for now the show on September

1534
01:20:26,624 --> 01:20:27,904
She has been accepted

1535
01:20:28,160 --> 01:20:31,488
There'll be a false-flag using Ebola as

1536
01:20:31,744 --> 01:20:32,256
The cover or what

1537
01:20:33,024 --> 01:20:35,328
If you remember earlier I said that it wasn't

1538
01:20:35,584 --> 01:20:36,096
Surprising

1539
01:20:36,352 --> 01:20:39,680
The doctors and nurses were too much of

1540
01:20:39,936 --> 01:20:40,960
September Moniqua

1541
01:20:42,240 --> 01:20:42,752
But

1542
01:20:43,008 --> 01:20:43,776
Propaganda

1543
01:20:44,032 --> 01:20:44,544
Communities

1544
01:20:46,592 --> 01:20:52,480
In the interest of total fantasy that I got completely swept

1545
01:20:53,248 --> 01:20:56,832
Not that Obama was causing it

1546
01:20:58,112 --> 01:21:03,232
But I really bought into the doom-and-gloom worst case scenario disaster for type of stuff

1547
01:21:03,488 --> 01:21:09,632
In 2014 I absolutely personal experience

1548
01:21:10,656 --> 01:21:13,728
Condom sustained and long-running campaign

1549
01:21:13,984 --> 01:21:18,080
To make people scared Airborne was going to go airborne

1550
01:21:18,336 --> 01:21:22,176
It all it was going to take with it of Ebola

1551
01:21:22,432 --> 01:21:22,944
To make it

1552
01:21:23,200 --> 01:21:24,224
Breathable

1553
01:21:24,736 --> 01:21:30,368
It was going to take America by storm

1554
01:21:30,624 --> 01:21:31,136
People's interest in

1555
01:21:31,392 --> 01:21:32,928
Survival food guns

1556
01:21:33,184 --> 01:21:34,464
All the sort of businesses that

1557
01:21:34,720 --> 01:21:35,232
It's rise on the

1558
01:21:35,488 --> 01:21:36,512
Panic of the immediate

1559
01:21:36,768 --> 01:21:38,304
Collapse but at the time

1560
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:39,072
Felt like a

1561
01:21:39,840 --> 01:21:41,888
A consistent bombardment of stories

1562
01:21:42,144 --> 01:21:43,936
This was just getting worse

1563
01:21:44,192 --> 01:21:44,960
I traffic

1564
01:21:45,216 --> 01:21:45,728
In

1565
01:21:45,984 --> 01:21:47,520
Conspiracy blogs and message

1566
01:21:47,776 --> 01:21:48,800
Boards and stuff like that

1567
01:21:49,056 --> 01:21:52,896
Around 2014

1568
01:21:53,408 --> 01:21:57,760
I wasn't buying the Rothschilds Run the World War 3

1569
01:21:58,016 --> 01:22:00,064
But this story did get to me

1570
01:22:00,320 --> 01:22:03,648
Like I remember this I was working at a shity job

1571
01:22:03,904 --> 01:22:05,184
Nothing to do or is it

1572
01:22:05,440 --> 01:22:06,464
Insurance company added

1573
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:08,512
Terrifying

1574
01:22:08,768 --> 01:22:12,096
And I rationalize it in my head I was reading these terrible thing

1575
01:22:13,632 --> 01:22:14,656
Ever find

1576
01:22:14,912 --> 01:22:21,056
Where are they sourcing their information like there are factual

1577
01:22:21,312 --> 01:22:21,824
Pieces of it like

1578
01:22:22,080 --> 01:22:23,872
Oh my God start

1579
01:22:24,128 --> 01:22:25,920
Now it's in Sierra Leone

1580
01:22:26,176 --> 01:22:29,760
Now it's in Liberia

1581
01:22:30,016 --> 01:22:31,552
It's in every

1582
01:22:32,064 --> 01:22:32,832
These blogs

1583
01:22:33,088 --> 01:22:33,600
Would just have

1584
01:22:33,856 --> 01:22:34,880
These all cap

1585
01:22:35,136 --> 01:22:35,648
Headlines

1586
01:22:35,904 --> 01:22:36,416
Of like

1587
01:22:36,672 --> 01:22:37,440
Eat snack

1588
01:22:38,464 --> 01:22:38,976
Coming

1589
01:22:39,232 --> 01:22:39,744
Coming

1590
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:42,816
It's a thing that I never really can

1591
01:22:43,072 --> 01:22:44,352
Considered but it is

1592
01:22:48,960 --> 01:22:49,728
After and all the sudden

1593
01:22:49,984 --> 01:22:50,752
Apples

1594
01:22:51,008 --> 01:22:52,544
F****** revenue-earning

1595
01:22:52,800 --> 01:22:54,336
Come out and it's higher than

1596
01:22:54,592 --> 01:22:55,872
Unexpected

1597
01:22:56,128 --> 01:22:59,200
Holyshit

1598
01:22:59,456 --> 01:22:59,968
Fly up

1599
01:23:00,224 --> 01:23:02,528
Like for these survivalist

1600
01:23:02,784 --> 01:23:04,832
I'm this kind of global pandemic

1601
01:23:05,344 --> 01:23:07,136
Veritiv comes up there to be like

1602
01:23:07,392 --> 01:23:08,672
Holyshit

1603
01:23:11,744 --> 01:23:12,256
Not real

1604
01:23:13,536 --> 01:23:14,560
Ebola like

1605
01:23:15,328 --> 01:23:16,096
It doesn't pop up

1606
01:23:16,352 --> 01:23:16,864
Valdosta

1607
01:23:19,168 --> 01:23:23,008
It's f****** cherished Crosby reality of has

1608
01:23:26,848 --> 01:23:27,616
You are in

1609
01:23:28,640 --> 01:23:29,664
Quite frankly

1610
01:23:31,200 --> 01:23:31,712
It's a

1611
01:23:32,992 --> 01:23:33,504
F******

1612
01:23:35,296 --> 01:23:37,344
It's one of the most

1613
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:38,112
Terrifying

1614
01:23:39,136 --> 01:23:40,672
You have the idea of

1615
01:23:41,952 --> 01:23:42,720
Worldwide

1616
01:23:45,024 --> 01:23:45,536
Perfect fit

1617
01:23:49,376 --> 01:23:49,888
From a

1618
01:23:50,144 --> 01:23:52,192
Brings in that so much

1619
01:23:52,448 --> 01:23:53,472
So much of that in

1620
01:23:53,728 --> 01:23:54,240
Grain

1621
01:23:54,496 --> 01:23:55,008
Cultural

1622
01:23:55,264 --> 01:23:57,312
Fear

1623
01:23:57,568 --> 01:24:02,176
We have bees in then we have Africanized bees

1624
01:24:02,432 --> 01:24:05,504
They're coming out of this place

1625
01:24:05,760 --> 01:24:11,392
So Savage

1626
01:24:11,648 --> 01:24:13,696
That works

1627
01:24:13,952 --> 01:24:18,304
From by perspective I'm not saying I'm not saying from you

1628
01:24:18,560 --> 01:24:20,096
From my perspective

1629
01:24:20,352 --> 01:24:21,376
Just seems like

1630
01:24:22,400 --> 01:24:23,680
Peacemaker

1631
01:24:24,192 --> 01:24:24,960
Because I was reading

1632
01:24:25,472 --> 01:24:25,984
Resources

1633
01:24:26,752 --> 01:24:27,264
Understand

1634
01:24:27,776 --> 01:24:29,568
You got to figure out this blog

1635
01:24:29,824 --> 01:24:30,336
Get your reading

1636
01:24:30,848 --> 01:24:33,408
What are they getting their information from

1637
01:24:33,664 --> 01:24:35,968
Changed

1638
01:24:36,224 --> 01:24:36,736
See if any

1639
01:24:41,856 --> 01:24:42,368
I got

1640
01:24:42,624 --> 01:24:43,904
I got deeply caught up

1641
01:24:44,160 --> 01:24:47,232
In this this

1642
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:48,512
They're just

1643
01:24:48,768 --> 01:24:50,048
Every time there was an oops

1644
01:24:50,304 --> 01:24:51,584
Possible case somewhere

1645
01:24:52,352 --> 01:24:53,120
Be a new blog post

1646
01:24:53,376 --> 01:24:55,424
Write new message board threads

1647
01:24:55,936 --> 01:24:56,960
Of all these like

1648
01:24:58,496 --> 01:24:59,008
Whenever where

1649
01:25:01,568 --> 01:25:03,104
It was a massive propaganda

1650
01:25:03,616 --> 01:25:04,128
Conspiracy world

1651
01:25:04,384 --> 01:25:06,432
Campaign going on well before Thomas Duncan

1652
01:25:06,688 --> 01:25:07,968
Never arrived in the United States

1653
01:25:08,736 --> 01:25:12,832
What I'm getting at is that it's not meaningful in any way that Robert David's

1654
01:25:13,088 --> 01:25:14,112
Pokemon Alex

1655
01:25:14,368 --> 01:25:14,880
The show

1656
01:25:15,136 --> 01:25:18,976
And said anything like they're going to use Ebola is a false flag

1657
01:25:19,232 --> 01:25:20,256
On September 8th

1658
01:25:21,536 --> 01:25:23,328
It was actually a really shrewd

1659
01:25:25,632 --> 01:25:26,912
Based on the facts on the ground

1660
01:25:27,424 --> 01:25:29,984
In August the World Health Organization declared

1661
01:25:30,240 --> 01:25:31,008
They continuing

1662
01:25:31,264 --> 01:25:32,800
Epidemic a public health

1663
01:25:33,056 --> 01:25:33,568
Emergency

1664
01:25:33,824 --> 01:25:34,848
Of international

1665
01:25:35,104 --> 01:25:37,664
Concerned technical designation on their plane

1666
01:25:37,920 --> 01:25:38,688
In August

1667
01:25:38,944 --> 01:25:43,296
Month before Robert Hatfield

1668
01:25:44,320 --> 01:25:45,344
And when they made that

1669
01:25:46,368 --> 01:25:48,672
That came just a little bit after

1670
01:25:48,928 --> 01:25:49,696
The August 5th

1671
01:25:50,464 --> 01:25:50,976
There was a

1672
01:25:51,232 --> 01:25:52,768
Confirmed case in Spain

1673
01:25:53,024 --> 01:25:55,840
A man who would end up dying a week later from the

1674
01:25:56,096 --> 01:25:56,864
The Ebola

1675
01:25:57,376 --> 01:25:59,168
Yeah yeah

1676
01:25:59,424 --> 01:26:01,472
In a country that was outside of a

1677
01:26:01,728 --> 01:26:02,752
Forgot

1678
01:26:03,008 --> 01:26:04,288
But he was

1679
01:26:04,544 --> 01:26:08,384
He wasn't Aid worker who had been in Africa course

1680
01:26:08,640 --> 01:26:10,176
And answer you have this

1681
01:26:10,944 --> 01:26:11,968
Already

1682
01:26:12,480 --> 01:26:14,016
Is penetrated the other

1683
01:26:14,272 --> 01:26:16,320
Yes outside

1684
01:26:16,576 --> 01:26:18,368
Spread

1685
01:26:18,624 --> 01:26:20,160
Everything the Robert David Steele

1686
01:26:20,416 --> 01:26:21,440
Was doing on Alex

1687
01:26:21,696 --> 01:26:22,208
The show on September

1688
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:24,512
Because

1689
01:26:25,024 --> 01:26:26,048
A month before this

1690
01:26:26,304 --> 01:26:27,840
Help organizations

1691
01:26:28,864 --> 01:26:30,400
Everybody everybody

1692
01:26:30,912 --> 01:26:33,728
Take this

1693
01:26:35,520 --> 01:26:36,544
Already

1694
01:26:38,080 --> 01:26:38,592
Outside

1695
01:26:39,104 --> 01:26:41,408
It is weird how

1696
01:26:43,712 --> 01:26:46,528
Making a perfectly reasonable response

1697
01:26:46,784 --> 01:26:48,320
To a massive

1698
01:26:49,344 --> 01:26:50,624
Really dangerous

1699
01:26:53,696 --> 01:26:55,744
Disease it hasn't really spread that much

1700
01:27:00,608 --> 01:27:01,888
It was it was

1701
01:27:02,144 --> 01:27:02,656
Mid

1702
01:27:02,912 --> 01:27:05,728
Because

1703
01:27:05,984 --> 01:27:06,752
Been going on

1704
01:27:10,592 --> 01:27:12,640
Going on in so far as to say

1705
01:27:13,920 --> 01:27:15,456
Less than 100,000

1706
01:27:16,224 --> 01:27:21,600
Do you know what I mean always what

1707
01:27:21,856 --> 01:27:23,904
Literally a global pandemic

1708
01:27:26,464 --> 01:27:27,232
This is a known

1709
01:27:28,256 --> 01:27:29,792
Morning

1710
01:27:30,048 --> 01:27:31,328
Early-on enough to

1711
01:27:33,632 --> 01:27:35,424
Early enough

1712
01:27:35,680 --> 01:27:37,728
People are going to run wild

1713
01:27:38,240 --> 01:27:39,008
Well thanks

1714
01:27:39,264 --> 01:27:42,592
Real strict criteria of what

1715
01:27:42,848 --> 01:27:43,360
Ketut

1716
01:27:43,616 --> 01:27:45,152
A crisis that the world needs

1717
01:27:45,408 --> 01:27:50,272
Be worried about is that they do that in August 20th

1718
01:27:52,576 --> 01:27:53,344
.

1719
01:27:54,624 --> 01:27:55,136
The first

1720
01:27:55,392 --> 01:27:55,904
Case

1721
01:27:56,160 --> 01:27:56,928
The first page

1722
01:27:57,440 --> 01:27:58,464
Was it December

1723
01:27:58,720 --> 01:27:59,232
2013

1724
01:27:59,744 --> 01:28:00,768
Foot District

1725
01:28:02,048 --> 01:28:03,840
It took a while for

1726
01:28:04,096 --> 01:28:06,656
Eat to become like

1727
01:28:06,912 --> 01:28:07,936
Three to four months after

1728
01:28:08,192 --> 01:28:09,472
Is that for real

1729
01:28:10,496 --> 01:28:12,032
WhatsApp

1730
01:28:13,056 --> 01:28:13,568
Took

1731
01:28:13,824 --> 01:28:14,848
Real specific

1732
01:28:15,104 --> 01:28:16,384
Take a note

1733
01:28:20,224 --> 01:28:20,736
Steelhead

1734
01:28:21,504 --> 01:28:22,272
Ferry boat

1735
01:28:23,040 --> 01:28:23,552
Faceted

1736
01:28:23,808 --> 01:28:24,320
Player

1737
01:28:28,160 --> 01:28:30,208
That we recognize this at all

1738
01:28:30,464 --> 01:28:31,744
2009

1739
01:28:32,256 --> 01:28:33,280
We haven't heard him

1740
01:28:33,536 --> 01:28:34,560
Back in 2009

1741
01:28:34,816 --> 01:28:37,120
But we've heard colors mention

1742
01:28:37,632 --> 01:28:39,680
Write about how you talk to him

1743
01:28:40,448 --> 01:28:41,472
On some shows

1744
01:28:41,728 --> 01:28:44,544
Virgo

1745
01:28:44,800 --> 01:28:45,312
This world

1746
01:28:45,824 --> 01:28:46,592
We've got to

1747
01:28:47,104 --> 01:28:47,616
An actual

1748
01:28:49,152 --> 01:28:50,176
We now jump into

1749
01:28:51,712 --> 01:28:52,480
2014

1750
01:28:52,736 --> 01:28:53,504
Robert David's

1751
01:28:55,040 --> 01:28:56,320
The Ebola is going

1752
01:28:56,832 --> 01:28:57,344
An outbreak

1753
01:28:58,112 --> 01:28:58,880
The false flag

1754
01:28:59,136 --> 01:28:59,904
Which

1755
01:29:00,672 --> 01:29:01,696
He's pretty clever

1756
01:29:02,208 --> 01:29:03,488
It's not I don't think it's ever

1757
01:29:04,256 --> 01:29:05,536
Anyway that is a false flag

1758
01:29:05,792 --> 01:29:06,304
He just like

1759
01:29:08,096 --> 01:29:08,608
Bridge bear

1760
01:29:08,864 --> 01:29:09,888
In terms of like

1761
01:29:10,656 --> 01:29:12,192
Real granting his

1762
01:29:12,448 --> 01:29:14,240
No looking at

1763
01:29:14,496 --> 01:29:15,520
The actual world

1764
01:29:16,032 --> 01:29:16,544
That exist

1765
01:29:17,312 --> 01:29:18,592
And figuring out the best way to live

1766
01:29:19,616 --> 01:29:20,128
I think it's pretty good

1767
01:29:20,640 --> 01:29:21,664
Bad

1768
01:29:21,920 --> 01:29:23,968
I mean his longevity

1769
01:29:24,480 --> 01:29:25,504
Evidence enough City

1770
01:29:26,016 --> 01:29:27,040
He's got some kind of

1771
01:29:27,296 --> 01:29:29,856
The angle that works I mean last until like what

1772
01:29:30,112 --> 01:29:30,624
Late 20

1773
01:29:33,184 --> 01:29:36,512
Yeah that was

1774
01:29:38,304 --> 01:29:42,144
Check that was like Steph Curry making two threes in a row and then being like

1775
01:29:42,400 --> 01:29:44,448
How about 45

1776
01:29:44,704 --> 01:29:46,496
I think Robert Davidson

1777
01:29:47,776 --> 01:29:48,544
Person get my

1778
01:29:50,592 --> 01:29:52,384
Might need to look a ton more into him

1779
01:29:52,640 --> 01:29:56,992
He's also a big Bitcoin booster kind of think he's more of a

1780
01:29:57,504 --> 01:29:59,040
Survivor than n

1781
01:30:00,832 --> 01:30:03,648
I see I see him being like a

1782
01:30:03,904 --> 01:30:07,744
I'm going to I'm going to ride these winds and then I'm going to change

1783
01:30:09,536 --> 01:30:10,304
I suspect you're wrong

1784
01:30:10,560 --> 01:30:11,584
But will write we will see

1785
01:30:14,400 --> 01:30:15,424
But

1786
01:30:17,984 --> 01:30:18,752
About how the global

1787
01:30:19,264 --> 01:30:20,032
To change the bulb

1788
01:30:22,592 --> 01:30:23,104
Houston

1789
01:30:34,368 --> 01:30:35,904
This narrative was

1790
01:30:36,160 --> 01:30:36,928
Flying all over the

1791
01:30:37,184 --> 01:30:38,208
Replace

1792
01:30:39,488 --> 01:30:40,000
The blogs

1793
01:30:42,816 --> 01:30:43,584
I was just pretending

1794
01:30:43,840 --> 01:30:44,864
The incubation. For

1795
01:30:47,168 --> 01:30:48,960
Like it used to be today

1796
01:30:49,216 --> 01:30:49,984
Is it now it's 20

1797
01:30:50,752 --> 01:30:51,264
That's all

1798
01:30:51,776 --> 01:30:54,336
The incubation period is always been arranged

1799
01:30:54,848 --> 01:30:57,408
It's historically been 22 21 days

1800
01:30:57,920 --> 01:30:58,688
With most cases

1801
01:30:58,944 --> 01:30:59,456
Is being with him

1802
01:30:59,712 --> 01:31:00,992
Create 10-day range

1803
01:31:01,248 --> 01:31:01,760
Twin symptoms

1804
01:31:02,016 --> 01:31:02,528
Manifest

1805
01:31:02,784 --> 01:31:04,064
Yeah it's a matter of

1806
01:31:04,320 --> 01:31:04,832
It's going out

1807
01:31:07,392 --> 01:31:07,904
Deviation

1808
01:31:08,416 --> 01:31:08,928
Like this

1809
01:31:09,184 --> 01:31:12,000
One standard deviation is 8 to 10 days

1810
01:31:12,512 --> 01:31:17,120
2 is 2221 or whatever like however however it actually works

1811
01:31:17,632 --> 01:31:18,656
Referendum

1812
01:31:19,168 --> 01:31:21,216
Nate silver would have a position

1813
01:31:21,472 --> 01:31:22,496
Generally speaking

1814
01:31:23,520 --> 01:31:24,288
3 weeks

1815
01:31:24,544 --> 01:31:25,824
You're at the point where it's like

1816
01:31:26,336 --> 01:31:27,360
If you haven't shown the

1817
01:31:27,616 --> 01:31:28,128
Symptoms you

1818
01:31:28,640 --> 01:31:29,152
Probably don't

1819
01:31:29,664 --> 01:31:30,944
Right route

1820
01:31:31,456 --> 01:31:33,504
3% Chase

1821
01:31:34,272 --> 01:31:35,296
So Alex is Alex

1822
01:31:35,552 --> 01:31:36,320
Pretending

1823
01:31:36,576 --> 01:31:37,088
It's always

1824
01:31:39,904 --> 01:31:44,512
Globulin globulin

1825
01:31:47,072 --> 01:31:48,096
Because that serves the

1826
01:31:48,864 --> 01:31:49,376
Of his ark

1827
01:31:50,144 --> 01:31:50,656
They walked

1828
01:31:51,168 --> 01:31:51,936
The fly into the country

1829
01:31:52,192 --> 01:31:58,336
Right because the country because there's a longer ink

1830
01:31:58,592 --> 01:31:59,616
Occupation.

1831
01:31:59,872 --> 01:32:00,896
They're not showing

1832
01:32:01,152 --> 01:32:03,968
Bada bing bada boom

1833
01:32:04,224 --> 01:32:06,528
She's going to take another week before I start

1834
01:32:06,784 --> 01:32:11,136
Really noticing that I have about life

1835
01:32:12,672 --> 01:32:14,720
Wherever

1836
01:32:14,976 --> 01:32:15,488
Exactly

1837
01:32:15,744 --> 01:32:16,512
That sort of thing

1838
01:32:18,304 --> 01:32:18,816
CDC head

1839
01:32:19,072 --> 01:32:19,840
To come out and be like

1840
01:32:24,704 --> 01:32:25,216
Is

1841
01:32:25,728 --> 01:32:27,008
Were anyone

1842
01:32:30,336 --> 01:32:30,848
Biso

1843
01:32:31,872 --> 01:32:34,176
Like any of the people that he imagined

1844
01:32:34,688 --> 01:32:35,968
Have the control

1845
01:32:36,480 --> 01:32:38,016
Do you think ya are there

1846
01:32:38,528 --> 01:32:41,600
There's still that would be worse

1847
01:32:41,856 --> 01:32:44,160
And easier transmitted than Ebola

1848
01:32:44,416 --> 01:32:45,696
That they could jobs book

1849
01:32:45,952 --> 01:32:46,464
Do that

1850
01:32:46,976 --> 01:32:49,792
Smallpox outbreak somewhere

1851
01:32:50,048 --> 01:32:50,560
It would be

1852
01:32:50,816 --> 01:32:51,584
Beat so easy

1853
01:32:51,840 --> 01:32:54,912
Feel like one of the problem

1854
01:32:55,168 --> 01:32:57,984
What are the problems with the way that you're lying problem

1855
01:32:58,496 --> 01:33:00,288
What are the scares

1856
01:33:00,544 --> 01:33:03,360
I wanted the way that we control diseases

1857
01:33:05,920 --> 01:33:06,432
Time

1858
01:33:06,688 --> 01:33:10,272
Some random scientist working in the CDC

1859
01:33:10,528 --> 01:33:11,040
Could just like

1860
01:33:11,296 --> 01:33:17,440
Sneak away of vial of smallpox and one on the ground that's exactly what happened with Larry

1861
01:33:19,488 --> 01:33:23,840
That's what happened with anthrax

1862
01:33:28,448 --> 01:33:28,960
Go read

1863
01:33:30,240 --> 01:33:31,776
41

1864
01:33:34,080 --> 01:33:35,360
Was.

1865
01:33:41,760 --> 01:33:45,088
Cliff here Alex gets to the end of the show

1866
01:33:45,344 --> 01:33:46,624
Making

1867
01:33:48,416 --> 01:33:49,696
I say facetiously

1868
01:33:52,256 --> 01:33:53,536
He's been doing his best to present

1869
01:33:53,792 --> 01:33:55,328
This idea that Obama is doing

1870
01:33:55,584 --> 01:33:56,864
The federal government

1871
01:33:57,120 --> 01:33:57,632
Is in charge of

1872
01:33:57,888 --> 01:33:58,656
If not letting planes

1873
01:33:59,680 --> 01:34:00,704
Not taking into account the

1874
01:34:02,496 --> 01:34:04,800
Alexa

1875
01:34:05,056 --> 01:34:06,080
Done before

1876
01:34:06,848 --> 01:34:07,360
This outbreak ever

1877
01:34:07,616 --> 01:34:09,408
Weapon Rarity

1878
01:34:09,664 --> 01:34:11,456
Is the one about this outbreak

1879
01:34:11,712 --> 01:34:12,736
Bitte Schon

1880
01:34:12,992 --> 01:34:14,272
Any kind of squash

1881
01:34:14,784 --> 01:34:16,320
What's the fact

1882
01:34:16,576 --> 01:34:18,368
I think we can agree without

1883
01:34:18,624 --> 01:34:20,160
He does say that Rick Perry is a

1884
01:34:22,464 --> 01:34:23,488
But he also was measured

1885
01:34:24,256 --> 01:34:26,816
That's true letting Perry off

1886
01:34:27,584 --> 01:34:28,096
Right

1887
01:34:28,352 --> 01:34:29,888
But he was also being like

1888
01:34:31,936 --> 01:34:35,264
I don't like seeing Alex like that

1889
01:34:35,776 --> 01:34:36,544
Because endgame

1890
01:34:36,800 --> 01:34:37,568
Literally end

1891
01:34:38,592 --> 01:34:39,616
With a horn

1892
01:34:39,872 --> 01:34:41,664
Outside Perris phone

1893
01:34:41,920 --> 01:34:44,992
She's outside Rick Perry's home

1894
01:34:45,248 --> 01:34:48,320
Bilderberg

1895
01:34:48,576 --> 01:34:51,648
Legitimately I do not remember that on account of what

1896
01:34:51,904 --> 01:34:53,184
Chicken game

1897
01:34:53,440 --> 01:34:53,952
The end

1898
01:34:54,208 --> 01:34:56,000
Closing shot

1899
01:34:57,024 --> 01:34:58,048
Lights go dark

1900
01:34:58,304 --> 01:35:04,192
Outside Rick Perry's house screaming into a bullhorn

1901
01:35:04,448 --> 01:35:06,240
1/2 hours before

1902
01:35:10,592 --> 01:35:11,616
I do want that violin

1903
01:35:11,872 --> 01:35:12,384
2BR sting

1904
01:35:15,712 --> 01:35:16,224
So

1905
01:35:16,480 --> 01:35:18,528
We got one more clip

1906
01:35:18,784 --> 01:35:19,296
It's a

1907
01:35:20,320 --> 01:35:21,088
Disaster

1908
01:35:21,600 --> 01:35:22,112
August 8th

1909
01:35:22,624 --> 01:35:23,392
Yeah

1910
01:35:24,416 --> 01:35:25,952
It's really like a Hallmark of our

1911
01:35:27,488 --> 01:35:28,512
That he has a lot of

1912
01:35:28,768 --> 01:35:29,280
Colors

1913
01:35:29,536 --> 01:35:30,816
Because we know they're anonymous

1914
01:35:31,328 --> 01:35:31,840
They're just calling

1915
01:35:33,888 --> 01:35:34,400
Is it like

1916
01:35:34,656 --> 01:35:36,192
I work in intelligence

1917
01:35:36,704 --> 01:35:37,728
We saw this with Zach

1918
01:35:37,984 --> 01:35:40,800
Yeah just call her that he kept I haven't

1919
01:35:41,312 --> 01:35:43,616
Mysteriously gone now hello him lately

1920
01:35:43,872 --> 01:35:44,384
What's up

1921
01:35:45,920 --> 01:35:49,248
Just drop that narrative

1922
01:35:49,504 --> 01:35:53,088
Probably run away to Morocco

1923
01:35:54,112 --> 01:35:55,904
Why hasn't left the country

1924
01:35:56,160 --> 01:35:56,672
That advice

1925
01:35:56,928 --> 01:35:58,720
A lot of these callers that call Lynn

1926
01:35:59,232 --> 01:36:00,768
Give themselves credential

1927
01:36:01,280 --> 01:36:01,792
In order to

1928
01:36:06,144 --> 01:36:06,912
What I've noticed

1929
01:36:07,168 --> 01:36:07,680
Is

1930
01:36:07,936 --> 01:36:09,216
They only do that

1931
01:36:09,472 --> 01:36:10,496
Tamir Alex

1932
01:36:11,520 --> 01:36:12,032
Bakkt

1933
01:36:13,312 --> 01:36:13,824
Anyways

1934
01:36:14,080 --> 01:36:14,592
Xanax

1935
01:36:14,848 --> 01:36:15,360
Can be like

1936
01:36:16,128 --> 01:36:21,504
I talked to this guy knows

1937
01:36:22,272 --> 01:36:25,088
There's an there's an echo chamber there where the audience

1938
01:36:25,600 --> 01:36:26,112
Understand

1939
01:36:26,624 --> 01:36:27,648
They can elevate

1940
01:36:27,904 --> 01:36:28,416
His narrative

1941
01:36:28,672 --> 01:36:29,184
5

1942
01:36:31,232 --> 01:36:31,744
Positive

1943
01:36:32,256 --> 01:36:33,536
Like in a way that's the

1944
01:36:34,560 --> 01:36:36,864
He's doing right think of this caller is a

1945
01:36:37,376 --> 01:36:38,400
Perfect representative

1946
01:36:39,680 --> 01:36:41,984
Insider from FEMA region 6

1947
01:36:42,240 --> 01:36:48,384
Incessant

1948
01:36:48,640 --> 01:36:52,992
An Informer state tax time or work for the regional agency

1949
01:36:53,248 --> 01:36:55,808
Formerly known as San Antonio Texas

1950
01:36:56,064 --> 01:37:00,416
Emergency planning

1951
01:37:00,672 --> 01:37:04,256
The reason I know the Ebola outbreak is being conducted on purpose

1952
01:37:04,512 --> 01:37:06,304
Is it violates all protocols

1953
01:37:06,560 --> 01:37:12,704
Are used to be involved in the Hurricane Katrina and Rita response of the evacuation

1954
01:37:12,960 --> 01:37:14,240
For smallpox outbreak

1955
01:37:14,752 --> 01:37:15,520
Is there a County

1956
01:37:15,776 --> 01:37:17,568
The proper response would be

1957
01:37:17,824 --> 01:37:18,848
The National Guard

1958
01:37:19,104 --> 01:37:20,640
Would steal off Bexar County

1959
01:37:21,152 --> 01:37:25,248
Law enforcement and Emergency Services would redirect the population to all hospitals

1960
01:37:25,504 --> 01:37:27,552
Churches and other government agencies

1961
01:37:27,808 --> 01:37:29,088
Where they would be screen

1962
01:37:29,600 --> 01:37:32,928
If they were sick they would be isolated at a former military base

1963
01:37:33,440 --> 01:37:35,488
I feel the sickness at the house or they died

1964
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:38,304
Everyone else will be forcibly vaccinated

1965
01:37:38,560 --> 01:37:43,168
It would be no exceptions or no travel in and out of their County so the fact that they're allowing people to

1966
01:37:43,424 --> 01:37:44,960
Travel into the United States

1967
01:37:45,216 --> 01:37:48,544
You're not walking down the city of Dallas Cowboy this is 5 desire

1968
01:37:49,312 --> 01:37:51,360
That guy was reading off a script

1969
01:37:52,640 --> 01:37:55,968
100% going to say that there's no way that

1970
01:37:56,480 --> 01:37:58,016
Extemporaneously

1971
01:37:58,272 --> 01:37:59,296
Expedia

1972
01:37:59,552 --> 01:38:00,064
Does 100%

1973
01:38:00,320 --> 01:38:01,088
Is reading a

1974
01:38:03,648 --> 01:38:06,208
This is full of s***

1975
01:38:06,720 --> 01:38:08,768
You clearly don't know what the protocol is

1976
01:38:09,024 --> 01:38:09,536
The situation lie

1977
01:38:09,792 --> 01:38:12,864
Like this and what he's pretty sure it's called in the National Guard

1978
01:38:13,888 --> 01:38:15,936
Screen everybody isolate people

1979
01:38:16,448 --> 01:38:16,960
Churches

1980
01:38:17,216 --> 01:38:17,728
And Hast

1981
01:38:17,984 --> 01:38:19,776
Bright

1982
01:38:20,032 --> 01:38:20,800
And then

1983
01:38:21,056 --> 01:38:27,200
Guy literally Alex Jones

1984
01:38:27,456 --> 01:38:33,600
Worst nightmare come true in terms of the federal government

1985
01:38:33,856 --> 01:38:35,136
Jason's at military bases

1986
01:38:35,392 --> 01:38:39,744
Churches that they have requisite shinned

1987
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:41,792
In reality this idea

1988
01:38:42,048 --> 01:38:43,072
From movies

1989
01:38:43,328 --> 01:38:45,632
At all reflect what professionals Act

1990
01:38:48,448 --> 01:38:49,984
America there was a large

1991
01:38:50,240 --> 01:38:51,264
Spell quarantine

1992
01:38:53,824 --> 01:38:57,152
No no

1993
01:38:59,200 --> 01:39:00,224
A large-scale corn

1994
01:39:00,736 --> 01:39:02,016
He was 1918

1995
01:39:02,528 --> 01:39:03,808
Mean when the Spanish Flu broke

1996
01:39:04,576 --> 01:39:06,112
No Public Health crisis center

1997
01:39:06,880 --> 01:39:07,648
And there have been many

1998
01:39:08,416 --> 01:39:08,928
Wednesday

1999
01:39:09,440 --> 01:39:10,208
Have been responded

2000
01:39:10,464 --> 01:39:11,744
Did you buy masks

2001
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:13,280
There's a good reason why

2002
01:39:13,792 --> 01:39:14,304
Multiple

2003
01:39:14,816 --> 01:39:16,096
Why 41

2004
01:39:16,608 --> 01:39:17,888
It doesn't work most space

2005
01:39:18,144 --> 01:39:19,424
Sickly

2006
01:39:19,680 --> 01:39:21,216
Almost certainly trigger a map

2007
01:39:21,984 --> 01:39:24,032
That could lead to all manner of unintended

2008
01:39:24,544 --> 01:39:27,360
Range vigilantism

2009
01:39:27,872 --> 01:39:28,384
Second

2010
01:39:28,640 --> 01:39:29,408
That panic

2011
01:39:29,664 --> 01:39:31,456
In people who see themselves as

2012
01:39:31,712 --> 01:39:32,480
Noxxic

2013
01:39:34,784 --> 01:39:35,296
Quarantine

2014
01:39:37,088 --> 01:39:38,112
Stay in the place where the

2015
01:39:38,624 --> 01:39:40,416
Unisinos Italy

2016
01:39:40,672 --> 01:39:41,440
Put others at

2017
01:39:42,208 --> 01:39:42,976
Is part of a human

2018
01:39:43,232 --> 01:39:43,744
Survival

2019
01:39:44,768 --> 01:39:45,536
Probably

2020
01:39:45,792 --> 01:39:47,584
Importantly a large-scale quarantine

2021
01:39:47,840 --> 01:39:48,864
Huge economic

2022
01:39:50,656 --> 01:39:54,496
Whatever City your quarantining effectively gets taken out of the larger economy

2023
01:39:54,752 --> 01:39:57,312
It's possible that billions

2024
01:39:57,568 --> 01:39:58,336
On top of

2025
01:39:58,592 --> 01:40:01,920
Whatever it would cost you to just do the quarantine the first right

2026
01:40:02,432 --> 01:40:04,224
Beyond that only 10 states

2027
01:40:04,480 --> 01:40:05,248
Laws in place that

2028
01:40:05,504 --> 01:40:08,320
People who have jobs

2029
01:40:09,088 --> 01:40:10,880
They are subject to a quart

2030
01:40:11,392 --> 01:40:12,416
Keep their jobs

2031
01:40:12,672 --> 01:40:13,440
Based on

2032
01:40:13,696 --> 01:40:14,976
Being subject to a quart

2033
01:40:15,488 --> 01:40:16,256
Nisei Texas

2034
01:40:18,048 --> 01:40:21,632
Sure I don't have a list of all

2035
01:40:22,144 --> 01:40:23,168
There's only 10 places

2036
01:40:23,424 --> 01:40:23,936
Is there like

2037
01:40:24,192 --> 01:40:29,312
If there's a quarantine you don't have to come to work week we cannot fire you for that alright

2038
01:40:29,824 --> 01:40:33,408
10 out of 50 I'm just going to say that

2039
01:40:35,200 --> 01:40:35,968
One of them is

2040
01:40:36,224 --> 01:40:37,248
Just Frankfurt

2041
01:40:38,016 --> 01:40:40,064
Sure I know for sure that they would do

2042
01:40:44,160 --> 01:40:47,488
Roxanne text

2043
01:40:47,744 --> 01:40:48,512
Kentucky

2044
01:40:48,768 --> 01:40:49,280
No

2045
01:40:49,536 --> 01:40:51,584
Look at the issue is they like

2046
01:40:51,840 --> 01:40:52,864
This doesn't

2047
01:40:55,168 --> 01:40:56,704
He's putting out into the world is fake inside

2048
01:40:57,472 --> 01:40:58,496
He's putting out.

2049
01:40:58,752 --> 01:40:59,264
Year of life

2050
01:40:59,520 --> 01:41:00,032
Quarantine

2051
01:41:00,544 --> 01:41:01,056
City

2052
01:41:01,824 --> 01:41:02,336
It doesn't

2053
01:41:04,896 --> 01:41:05,664
Is you end up

2054
01:41:06,176 --> 01:41:07,968
But you just imagine in your

2055
01:41:08,992 --> 01:41:10,016
You're not a dumper

2056
01:41:11,040 --> 01:41:12,576
Imagine what happened

2057
01:41:14,112 --> 01:41:16,160
He's talking about quarantining

2058
01:41:16,416 --> 01:41:17,440
Dallas Texas

2059
01:41:17,952 --> 01:41:20,768
It's nonsensical proposition

2060
01:41:21,024 --> 01:41:23,840
The idea that you were ever going to be able to create

2061
01:41:24,096 --> 01:41:25,120
Like

2062
01:41:25,376 --> 01:41:29,216
Actual

2063
01:41:29,728 --> 01:41:32,800
I'm build the walls of fun fun things to do out

2064
01:41:38,688 --> 01:41:40,224
You're ever going to be able to

2065
01:41:40,480 --> 01:41:41,248
Oyster

2066
01:41:41,504 --> 01:41:45,088
This or whatever

2067
01:41:46,112 --> 01:41:47,648
What is smart about quarantine

2068
01:41:48,928 --> 01:41:49,952
As a rule

2069
01:41:50,208 --> 01:41:52,000
Is a small as possible

2070
01:41:52,768 --> 01:41:54,560
So if you have someone who is

2071
01:41:54,816 --> 01:41:56,608
Do you have a strong suspicion

2072
01:41:56,864 --> 01:41:58,144
Has the condition

2073
01:41:59,168 --> 01:42:00,448
Quarantine that person

2074
01:42:00,704 --> 01:42:01,472
In a hospital

2075
01:42:02,496 --> 01:42:03,008
Quarantine

2076
01:42:03,776 --> 01:42:04,544
The house

2077
01:42:04,800 --> 01:42:07,360
In terms of don't let other people go in there

2078
01:42:07,616 --> 01:42:08,384
Corinth

2079
01:42:08,640 --> 01:42:10,688
You don't have to clean the entire house

2080
01:42:10,944 --> 01:42:14,272
What good is that going to do you if no one goes in

2081
01:42:14,784 --> 01:42:15,808
It doesn't help you

2082
01:42:18,368 --> 01:42:18,880
Jordan

2083
01:42:19,136 --> 01:42:20,160
We have this Insider

2084
01:42:21,184 --> 01:42:22,720
Really full of s***

2085
01:42:22,976 --> 01:42:23,744
But he's not

2086
01:42:24,768 --> 01:42:25,280
Absolutely

2087
01:42:29,888 --> 01:42:30,400
Create

2088
01:42:34,752 --> 01:42:35,776
He's trying to create

2089
01:42:36,032 --> 01:42:36,544
Apperception

2090
01:42:36,800 --> 01:42:38,080
Of himself

2091
01:42:39,360 --> 01:42:40,896
To reinforce Alex Jones

2092
01:42:41,152 --> 01:42:41,664
Narrative

2093
01:42:42,176 --> 01:42:42,688
He has heard

2094
01:42:42,944 --> 01:42:43,712
By listening

2095
01:42:43,968 --> 01:42:44,480
Doubt

2096
01:42:47,296 --> 01:42:48,832
Maybe but yeah

2097
01:42:49,344 --> 01:42:52,672
In many ways like he doesn't get your own deal and if not

2098
01:42:52,928 --> 01:42:53,696
He's on an ash

2099
01:42:54,208 --> 01:42:59,584
Syndicated Radio Networks

2100
01:43:02,144 --> 01:43:03,680
Can't really use that to help

2101
01:43:04,192 --> 01:43:05,984
Go to the bar

2102
01:43:06,240 --> 01:43:06,752
And everyone's like

2103
01:43:07,776 --> 01:43:09,824
Hello Colonel or whatever like

2104
01:43:10,080 --> 01:43:11,360
Raira

2105
01:43:11,616 --> 01:43:12,128
There's still some

2106
01:43:13,664 --> 01:43:14,176
It's only four

2107
01:43:14,432 --> 01:43:14,944
For you

2108
01:43:15,200 --> 01:43:15,712
But it's also

2109
01:43:18,016 --> 01:43:18,528
Kind of like

2110
01:43:18,784 --> 01:43:19,296
Donation

2111
01:43:20,576 --> 01:43:21,856
Alex is audience often

2112
01:43:22,624 --> 01:43:23,648
Yeah just ideas

2113
01:43:24,160 --> 01:43:25,440
They're going to lie

2114
01:43:25,696 --> 01:43:26,464
In order to bolster

2115
01:43:27,232 --> 01:43:28,000
Does narratives forehead

2116
01:43:29,024 --> 01:43:31,072
On the show

2117
01:43:31,328 --> 01:43:33,376
Insomnia to make your narrative feel import

2118
01:43:34,656 --> 01:43:35,168
Is important

2119
01:43:35,424 --> 01:43:36,192
For both of us

2120
01:43:36,448 --> 01:43:37,216
So I'm going to

2121
01:43:37,472 --> 01:43:38,240
I'm going to

2122
01:43:38,496 --> 01:43:40,032
You need someone to lie to me

2123
01:43:40,544 --> 01:43:44,640
This makes sense so I'm going to do it for you

2124
01:43:45,408 --> 01:43:45,920
And I'm not

2125
01:43:48,480 --> 01:43:50,784
I'm saying this because what he saying makes no sense

2126
01:43:51,552 --> 01:43:53,344
The idea of like quarantine in

2127
01:43:54,368 --> 01:43:55,648
As large as Dallas or

2128
01:43:55,904 --> 01:43:56,416
Or even like

2129
01:43:56,672 --> 01:43:57,440
He said

2130
01:43:57,696 --> 01:43:58,464
Bexar County

2131
01:43:59,744 --> 01:44:01,024
It's spelled vexar

2132
01:44:01,536 --> 01:44:02,304
Pronounce Barak

2133
01:44:03,072 --> 01:44:04,864
Is weird

2134
01:44:05,376 --> 01:44:10,240
Bibb County you're not allowed

2135
01:44:11,776 --> 01:44:12,288
The idea

2136
01:44:15,616 --> 01:44:16,640
Yeah

2137
01:44:16,896 --> 01:44:17,664
Tiny Town

2138
01:44:20,224 --> 01:44:21,504
We close down every

2139
01:44:22,528 --> 01:44:23,552
Your population is

2140
01:44:25,344 --> 01:44:25,856
Maybe

2141
01:44:26,368 --> 01:44:27,392
I think that's in effect

2142
01:44:28,416 --> 01:44:29,952
Maybe that would be what

2143
01:44:30,720 --> 01:44:32,000
Real baby

2144
01:44:32,512 --> 01:44:33,280
Statistically

2145
01:44:33,792 --> 01:44:34,560
Maybe you could keep

2146
01:44:34,816 --> 01:44:35,840
200 people under

2147
01:44:36,352 --> 01:44:37,632
Maybe

2148
01:44:37,888 --> 01:44:38,400
Put that into

2149
01:44:38,656 --> 01:44:39,680
2000 people

2150
01:44:40,192 --> 01:44:42,496
One is going to get out way more than that

2151
01:44:42,752 --> 01:44:45,056
And yes I know and I know but like

2152
01:44:45,312 --> 01:44:51,456
Minimum order of

2153
01:44:54,016 --> 01:45:00,160
But might I would like to say thank you to George Soros Junior for suggesting this

2154
01:45:01,696 --> 01:45:04,256
If for no other reason that I learned about Ellis Island

2155
01:45:04,768 --> 01:45:05,280
I appreciate it

2156
01:45:08,864 --> 01:45:09,632
Anyway I would say

2157
01:45:10,912 --> 01:45:11,424
Walt

2158
01:45:11,680 --> 01:45:12,448
Happy birthday

2159
01:45:12,960 --> 01:45:14,752
You're the best

2160
01:45:16,288 --> 01:45:22,432
You are

2161
01:45:27,296 --> 01:45:29,600
You son-of-a-b**** Walt you're one of the best

2162
01:45:31,136 --> 01:45:32,928
Water fun

2163
01:45:34,720 --> 01:45:36,512
I enjoy dipping toes

2164
01:45:38,560 --> 01:45:39,328
Out of context

2165
01:45:39,584 --> 01:45:41,120
Yeah because we're not evercon

2166
01:45:42,144 --> 01:45:44,192
We know a lot about Alex Jones

2167
01:45:44,704 --> 01:45:47,008
Days that we check in

2168
01:45:47,264 --> 01:45:47,776
We can come

2169
01:45:48,032 --> 01:45:50,336
Understand what he's talking about

2170
01:45:50,848 --> 01:45:52,128
If we've done this episode

2171
01:45:54,176 --> 01:45:54,944
It would have been like

2172
01:46:01,344 --> 01:46:01,856
Sterilize Aldi

2173
01:46:02,112 --> 01:46:04,416
Isabelle the narrative

2174
01:46:05,440 --> 01:46:05,952
Now is it

2175
01:46:06,976 --> 01:46:09,024
Right as it might be my way of

2176
01:46:09,280 --> 01:46:10,560
Deflecting from the idea that

2177
01:46:10,816 --> 01:46:13,888
There are a number of time travel request that we haven't done

2178
01:46:16,704 --> 01:46:17,216
Be better because

2179
01:46:17,472 --> 01:46:17,984
Put them off

2180
01:46:18,496 --> 01:46:19,264
And thank you all

2181
01:46:20,544 --> 01:46:21,056
Always

2182
01:46:21,568 --> 01:46:22,080
If you remind me

2183
01:46:22,592 --> 01:46:23,104
Again

2184
01:46:23,360 --> 01:46:24,128
About needing

2185
01:46:25,664 --> 01:46:27,200
If you have sent me a time traveler Quest

2186
01:46:27,456 --> 01:46:29,760
It can't hurt to remind me again I'm not going

2187
01:46:33,344 --> 01:46:34,112
Wouldn't mind

2188
01:46:35,392 --> 01:46:36,416
This is just language

2189
01:46:37,440 --> 01:46:40,512
When you say we know a lot about Alex Jones

2190
01:46:41,024 --> 01:46:41,536
I would

2191
01:46:41,792 --> 01:46:42,816
Prefer if you said

2192
01:46:43,072 --> 01:46:44,608
We know a nun

2193
01:46:44,864 --> 01:46:46,144
Fortunate

2194
01:46:46,400 --> 01:46:52,544
What about Alex

2195
01:46:52,800 --> 01:46:58,176
I know about about a

2196
01:46:58,432 --> 01:46:59,200
Do anything else

2197
01:46:59,456 --> 01:47:01,504
What's my life like I literally can't

2198
01:47:02,272 --> 01:47:04,064
Do you know who didn't kill anybody

2199
01:47:04,576 --> 01:47:07,648
Somebody's Brewery

2200
01:47:07,904 --> 01:47:08,928
Never killed anybody

2201
01:47:09,184 --> 01:47:10,720
Do you know what he didn't have

2202
01:47:10,976 --> 01:47:11,488
A website

2203
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:13,536
Do you know we have

2204
01:47:13,792 --> 01:47:15,840
We do have a website

2205
01:47:16,352 --> 01:47:17,888
Do you know what the guy who I'm

2206
01:47:18,144 --> 01:47:20,704
Specifically thinking of who didn't kill anybody didn't have

2207
01:47:21,216 --> 01:47:22,496
Twitter account

2208
01:47:23,776 --> 01:47:24,288
The end of this

2209
01:47:25,312 --> 01:47:27,872
He'd have a website but we acknowledge

Underscore fight

2211
01:47:32,736 --> 01:47:38,880
Cora group on Facebook

2212
01:47:46,560 --> 01:47:47,072
Serious thing

2213
01:47:47,328 --> 01:47:48,096
The Greek

2214
01:47:49,376 --> 01:47:49,888
Mithras

2215
01:47:50,656 --> 01:47:53,216
Mithras never killed anybody

2216
01:47:53,728 --> 01:47:57,568
And then three days later came back to life and there are no similarities

2217
01:48:00,128 --> 01:48:04,992
Are you sure mithras never killed anybody or expired a photo of somebody

2218
01:48:07,808 --> 01:48:08,320
Jesus

2219
01:48:08,576 --> 01:48:13,440
Who in the Apocrypha

2220
01:48:13,696 --> 01:48:14,720
The child gospel

2221
01:48:15,232 --> 01:48:21,376
You killed his friend finally brought him back to life so it's kind of

2222
01:48:21,632 --> 01:48:22,656
Enzo dragons were dealt

2223
01:48:23,168 --> 01:48:23,680
Sure

2224
01:48:24,704 --> 01:48:25,216
It's not a sin

2225
01:48:25,472 --> 01:48:26,496
But

2226
01:48:26,752 --> 01:48:29,056
Never killed nobody

2227
01:48:30,592 --> 01:48:32,128
Technically probably

2228
01:48:32,640 --> 01:48:33,152
That's out

2229
01:48:37,760 --> 01:48:41,600
