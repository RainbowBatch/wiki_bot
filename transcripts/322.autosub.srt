00:00:04,096 --> 00:00:10,240
Alex

2
00:00:10,496 --> 00:00:16,640
Around big novelty Beverages and talk a little bit about Alex Jones

3
00:00:16,896 --> 00:00:17,920
Jordan

4
00:00:18,432 --> 00:00:19,456
What's the longest set

5
00:00:19,712 --> 00:00:20,224
You've ever seen

6
00:00:24,064 --> 00:00:25,856
That's the first time you said that

7
00:00:26,112 --> 00:00:28,160
200 episode

8
00:00:28,416 --> 00:00:30,464
Rudolph

9
00:00:32,512 --> 00:00:34,048
I don't know I mean

10
00:00:34,304 --> 00:00:40,448
You ever seen

11
00:00:40,704 --> 00:00:43,520
Flowers

12
00:00:44,288 --> 00:00:47,360
I've seen Comics 2 hours

13
00:00:49,152 --> 00:00:50,688
Patton Oswalt live

14
00:00:50,944 --> 00:00:57,088
I saw the veil Crawford back in Columbia Missouri do an hour of not stop laughing

15
00:00:57,344 --> 00:00:59,904
We actually were at the comedy club

16
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,952
In Columbia

17
00:01:02,208 --> 00:01:03,232
We were sure

18
00:01:03,488 --> 00:01:09,632
By the security guard

19
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:10,400
Are you younger

20
00:01:10,656 --> 00:01:12,704
I think it was before I actually did,

21
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,032
I think it was it was previous to buy getting into

22
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:21,920
Territory for me

23
00:01:22,176 --> 00:01:23,200
Once I started doing stand-up

24
00:01:23,712 --> 00:01:24,224
I resent it

25
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:30,624
What does negative

26
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:34,720
Enjoyed it

27
00:01:40,096 --> 00:01:40,864
Friends do

28
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,144
40 minute hour

29
00:01:42,656 --> 00:01:48,288
Half hours.

30
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:50,080
Not not that cigars

31
00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:58,528
Does the Pakistan a lot about Lavell Crawford and Alex

32
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:06,720
Correct as we are going over some present-day business

33
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:09,280
We're going over July 16th and 17th

34
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:10,048
20 nights

35
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,352
Which is Tuesday and Wednesday of this

36
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:21,056
Have I found some b*******

37
00:02:21,312 --> 00:02:27,456
Going on in the world 16th and 17th

38
00:02:27,712 --> 00:02:28,224

40
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,528
Most

41
00:02:30,784 --> 00:02:33,600
Sounds impressive

42
00:02:35,136 --> 00:02:37,440
Here

43
00:02:38,208 --> 00:02:40,768
I don't like a good bit of this stuff

44
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:42,304
That we're going to go over

45
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:50,752
Forget today's episode

46
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:52,544
Michelle

47
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,872
First of all

48
00:02:56,384 --> 00:02:58,432
I'm a policy wonk

00:02:58,688 --> 00:03:01,248
Text Elliot

50
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,784
I'm a policy wonk

51
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,344
Text John

52
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,904
Thank you so much and I'll probably walk

53
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:11,744
I'm a policy wonk

54
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:18,144
Human mangle Heimer Schmidt is that

55
00:03:18,656 --> 00:03:20,448
I'm a policy wonk

56
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:24,800
Mima t.i. cool spelling

57
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:25,824
Cyclops

58
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,152
Normal spelling

59
00:03:29,664 --> 00:03:31,968
Cyclops

60
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:33,248
The boring normal swelling

61
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:43,488
Somebody donated on an elevated level

62
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:46,560
Mercer Roberts thank you so much you are now

63
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:59,104
Business heroin

64
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:03,712
Freakishly large

65
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:16,512
Sports shirt we would appreciate it

66
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:22,143
So I was going over this and preparing it on

67
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:25,471
Anyone who pays attention

68
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:31,871
The news or social media may be aware his rally where his audience started chanting

69
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:37,503
A representative ottobar

70
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:40,319
By I'm sick of this b*******

71
00:04:40,575 --> 00:04:41,343
Tone

72
00:04:41,599 --> 00:04:43,647
It might come out a little bit in this

73
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:45,951
A lot of the time I like to

74
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:50,047
Play around

75
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:51,839
Blunt

76
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:52,607
In something

77
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:58,239
This episode than normal.

78
00:04:59,263 --> 00:04:59,775
Well

79
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:01,823
I don't want to comment Miss

80
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:03,359
Literally about the government

81
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:06,687
But I will call I will comment on propaganda techniques

82
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:11,295
Start the show on July

83
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:16,415
This is an interesting thing Alex makes

84
00:05:16,671 --> 00:05:20,511
Horrible Freudian slip in the introduction to the episode

85
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:29,727
Alive Tuesday level of transmission what

86
00:05:31,007 --> 00:05:37,151
What does a globalist

87
00:05:37,407 --> 00:05:38,175
Satanism perhaps

88
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:40,735
Globalism

89
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:45,599
It's possible it and everybody is capable of Miss p

90
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:49,695
To me a reason I'm

91
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:51,231
Drawing Focus today

92
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:54,047
Is because Alex is really good at the end

93
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:56,863
Like when he comes in he almost

94
00:05:57,119 --> 00:05:57,631
Never makes

95
00:05:59,167 --> 00:06:05,311
So rapid that gets its Global transmission

96
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:12,223
He says he'll be back Lord willing tomorrow every single day

97
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:13,503
The repetition has

98
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:15,039
Become script

99
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:21,695
So when he says this is a globalist that's a pretty big dude from the strip

100
00:06:22,463 --> 00:06:25,535
And it probably would just be like haha that's funny you're stupid

101
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:27,071
But on the 17th

102
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:27,839
He says this

103
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:35,007
July 19th

104
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:41,663
18th on Wednesday on Wednesday

105
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:45,503
Trolls

106
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:46,783
Heat

107
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:49,343
Yeah cuz I I mean I don't want to

108
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:51,647
Make a mountain out of a molehill

109
00:06:51,903 --> 00:06:53,439
I do not hear him

110
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:57,279
Screw up the intro very often and in 2 days twice

111
00:06:57,791 --> 00:07:03,423
Stancil departures from the norm

112
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:05,471
Those are

113
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:07,263
The fuk up

114
00:07:08,799 --> 00:07:14,943
I don't think it means anything I just think maybe is phoning it in a little bit even his subconscious doesn't give a s*** anymore

115
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:23,135
He starts off on a narrative about before but I felt the way he was talking about it

116
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:23,903
Deserved

117
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:24,671
A little bit of a

118
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:30,559
Classified the foundation of the CIA and others by the 50s

119
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:39,263
Hollywood

120
00:07:48,223 --> 00:07:50,271
Destroy the attention span

121
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:55,903
Because you better get rid of it by the last lie

122
00:07:57,695 --> 00:08:00,767
Goldfish

123
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:03,327
The Ford Foundation

124
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:05,375
They're they're terrible

125
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:07,679
Sesame Street

126
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:11,519
Coronavirus

127
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:16,383
Very idea of berseria

128
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:17,407
Create television

129
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:18,687
In order to destroy the attention

130
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:19,967
Population

131
00:08:20,223 --> 00:08:23,039
That's exactly the sort of unhinged stupid

132
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:23,807
Come out of the mouth

133
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:24,575
This f****** idiot

134
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:31,231
He's relying on fake studies information meeting with terms and it completely made up

135
00:08:31,487 --> 00:08:32,255
Live

136
00:08:34,303 --> 00:08:35,071
In their home

137
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:36,351
It's going to destroy their attention

138
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:38,911
You'll be easily treatable

139
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:39,935
Globalist

140
00:08:45,055 --> 00:08:45,823
That's really the point

141
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:48,895
Alex constantly talks about how our attention

142
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:50,431
Shorter than a gold

143
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:51,711
She heard him say it right there

144
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:54,271
Because it's a great mental image

145
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:57,087
Goldfish before they don't seem to be all that

146
00:08:57,343 --> 00:08:58,111
Interbreeding

147
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:02,719
Goldfish actually have

148
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:03,743
Significant

149
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:10,143
Favorite they finish the Dostoevsky more than you can say

150
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:13,471
Either

151
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:19,615
Unfortunately I was just repeating something years ago it's been thoroughly described

152
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:22,431
This piece of salacious in Spokane

153
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:25,759
From a 2015 study the consumer insights

154
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:27,295
Team of Microsoft Canada

155
00:09:30,367 --> 00:09:31,391
The study of sounds of problems

156
00:09:31,903 --> 00:09:37,279
The first was that the stuff about attention span was just something that was cited in the Microsoft report

157
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:39,327
But didn't have to do with their actual research

158
00:09:40,095 --> 00:09:42,911
It was allegedly from a source called statistic brain

159
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:45,983
We're taking the information from the quote

160
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:50,591
National Center for biotechnology information at the US National Library of Medicine

161
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:51,871
And the associated

162
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:57,503
Simon Maybin at the BBC reached out to all these entities and none of them could find any research

163
00:09:57,759 --> 00:09:59,295
Backed up the claims that were made on Stitcher

164
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:05,951
Which was included in the Microsoft Canada report and then repeated tirelessly by dumbfucks like Alex

165
00:10:06,463 --> 00:10:10,559
You want to convince everyone that the modern world is built on a satanic

166
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:16,447
Of course it also was repeated exhaustively by well-meaning but maybe not all that thorough media Outlets

167
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:17,471
Who are huntingford

168
00:10:17,727 --> 00:10:21,567
Easy human interest story to report and before you know it the idea had the appearance

169
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:22,591
Credibility

170
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:26,943
We're at when in reality it might as well just been made up out of thin air

171
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:29,503
The only problem with this notion

172
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:34,623
The bigger issue is that attention span when you talk about it like this is a meaningless term

173
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:35,903
What does it mean with me

174
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:37,951
How long you can pay attention to something

175
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:38,719
How is it

176
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:40,511
Intention calculated into the measure

177
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:43,071
I mean obviously if you were trying to pay attention

178
00:10:44,351 --> 00:10:45,631
Intuit longer than if you were

179
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:48,703
Or if you're interested in the things you're paying attention to you stuck

180
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:49,727
Could be able to pay attention

181
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:51,519
Do longer than 9 seconds

182
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:58,175
Is this alleged attention span sad had any real-world meeting could watch a movie or TV show without being

183
00:10:58,431 --> 00:10:59,711
Wheatley overwhelmed in-laws

184
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:01,247
It doesn't mean any

185
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:05,599
People who study attention would never think about attention in the way Alex

186
00:11:05,855 --> 00:11:06,623
What is presenting the ID

187
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:12,511
Humans pay attention to things differently depending on how much it appears the situation there in requires them

188
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:14,047
It's like effort

189
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:14,815
In that way

190
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:17,375
You kind of able to discern how much effort

191
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:18,655
Task is going to require

192
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:21,215
And then you subconsciously decide whether or not you're in

193
00:11:21,471 --> 00:11:25,311
Interested and exerting that amount of effort in the service of completing that

194
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:27,871
300,000 people just turned

195
00:11:28,127 --> 00:11:34,271
It's not working

196
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:39,391
Subconscious conscious decision that you're making and I respect you for it

197
00:11:39,903 --> 00:11:41,439
The very idea of what Alex

198
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:42,463
2 talkin about is to

199
00:11:43,231 --> 00:11:44,511
What is it about

200
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:48,351
Is it the physical TV screen

201
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:49,631
Because if that's the case

202
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:50,911
Exactly

203
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:52,191
Could be caused by watching Alex

204
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:52,959
Cuz she

205
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:53,983
Is it the constant

206
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:55,263
Changing of topic

207
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:57,823
Because if it's that Alex jumps

208
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:03,199
From subject to subject of the f-far quicker and more disoriented

209
00:12:03,455 --> 00:12:03,967
Racine

210
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:07,551
Distraction game of vaguely referencing

211
00:12:07,807 --> 00:12:10,623
Been jumping to another subject without ever getting into what he was talkin

212
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:13,439
He's talkingshit

213
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:17,023
There's no reality to the idea that your actual attention

214
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:18,047
Spanish being shortened

215
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:20,863
And the only possible approach

216
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:23,423
Is possibly

217
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:25,983
Society modernized

218
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:28,543
Our ability to convey information forces

219
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:35,199
With the Advent of the internet the ability to disseminate that information in little chunks

220
00:12:35,455 --> 00:12:36,223
Has allowed people to

221
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:39,295
Taking information without exerting a great deal of attention

222
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:41,855
Which is possibly train people to expect not

223
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:43,391
Have to pay attention

224
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:45,695
The things were very long while still expecting

225
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:47,743
Some

226
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:49,279
Information

227
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:51,327
Expressed

228
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:52,607
If that's

229
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:53,375
Conspiracy

230
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:54,143
Lady wants

231
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:55,679
Listening

232
00:12:56,191 --> 00:12:59,007
I probably also bring up that you know if that's the

233
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:01,311
He's an active participant

234
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:02,847
Especially these days

235
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:04,639
Completely obsessed with memes

236
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:08,223
He's run meme contest he calls himself the meme machine

237
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:14,111
The other weirdos like Carpe donktum on his show whose only relevant in the world of this point is that they make

238
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:21,279
Memes are probably the method of conveying information that requires the least attention imaginable

239
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:25,631
Totally fine people information

240
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:27,423
Exerting is zero

241
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:31,775
A name in his

242
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:34,079
In any way

243
00:13:34,335 --> 00:13:35,615
You can still

244
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:37,407
Require memes

245
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:39,967
Any vacuum

246
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:45,343
Now but you can also still resent that you have

247
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:46,111
Have to do so

248
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:50,207
You know like

249
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:52,255
Of course he does

250
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:55,839
S*** on me and very well

251
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:56,607
Position

252
00:13:56,863 --> 00:13:58,143
I'm not I'm not

253
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:00,703
Do you know deriding the entirety of memes and

254
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:02,495
Culture

255
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:06,335
Means of communication through me and I'm just saying but like

256
00:14:06,591 --> 00:14:08,383
If you're concerned

257
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,175
Train to have a shorter attention span

258
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:12,223
You should dick suspect

259
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:13,759
What is memes right now

260
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:18,367
Opposed

261
00:14:18,623 --> 00:14:20,159
Or I don't know cartoon

262
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:25,279
Political cartoons

263
00:14:30,143 --> 00:14:36,287
If you got it it takes a while to get all the drivers figured out and then you have to figure out what the f*** it is he's trying to say in the first

264
00:14:39,871 --> 00:14:41,407
Apex that is better

265
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:42,175
To be a

266
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:43,455
Recurring theme

267
00:14:44,223 --> 00:14:46,015
I can find no evidence of the globalist

268
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:49,087
Therefore soundation publishing a plan to ruin the public attention

269
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:51,903
The media so they be able to

270
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:53,695
People wouldn't be able to remember what was

271
00:14:53,951 --> 00:14:55,231
Being talked about previously

272
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:57,535
Can't find any Declassified documents

273
00:14:57,791 --> 00:15:00,607
Festivus

274
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:03,935
The protocols of the Elders of Zion

275
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:10,079
Huey's from protocol number 13

276
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:16,735
Agents taking on to our press from among the goyim will at our orders discuss anything which is inconvenient

277
00:15:16,991 --> 00:15:19,295
For us to issue directly an official document

278
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:23,903
While quietly amid the din of the discussion

279
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:27,487
We shall carry through such measures as

280
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:29,023
We wish and that offer them to

281
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:30,815
The publication as accomplished fact

282
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:37,471
The abrogation of a matter once settled

283
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:39,775
And immediately

284
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:41,055
The Press will distract

285
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:42,847
The current of thought

286
00:15:43,615 --> 00:15:44,383
Grandparents

287
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:47,711
Have we not train people always something new

288
00:15:48,223 --> 00:15:54,111
In the discussions of these new questions will throw themselves those of the brainless dispensers of Fortune

289
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:58,719
Who are not able even now to understand that they have not the remotest conception

290
00:15:58,975 --> 00:15:59,743
About the matters

291
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:00,511
Which they undertake

292
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:02,815
You know it.

293
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:04,863
Is absolutely an example of

294
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:07,167
The difference in communication

295
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:09,471
Because what that really just said there was like

296
00:16:09,983 --> 00:16:14,079
Forever

297
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:17,919
It's very similar to the ideas expressed by Alex

298
00:16:18,175 --> 00:16:24,319
It's one of countless passages in the protocols about the need to distract the volume so they won't get in the way of the elders evil plan

299
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:30,719
Interesting

300
00:16:30,975 --> 00:16:31,487
Medium

301
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:36,095
Every Super Bowl Sunday

302
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:39,935
He believes that matter sublimating their Warrior instincts through fake Warfare

303
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:42,495
But his bigger issue I promise you this

304
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:45,823
Is that the whole thing

305
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:47,359
Sports are a distraction

306
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:51,967
He asserts that you could know everything about the New World Order and their evil plan

307
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:53,759
But instead you know all this

308
00:16:54,783 --> 00:16:55,295
Quarterback

309
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:57,599
And it's a waste of your time and attention

310
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:05,535
We further distracted with amusements game pastimes passions people palaces

311
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:09,631
Soon we shall begin through the press to propose competitions and art

312
00:17:10,143 --> 00:17:11,167
Sport of all kinds

313
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:16,031
These interest will finally distract their minds from questions and which we should find ourselves

314
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:17,567
Compelled to oppose them

315
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:20,127
Growing bored or just accustomed to reflect

316
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:21,919
And form any opinions of Their Own

317
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:27,551
People will begin to talk in the same tone as we because we alone shall be offering them new directions for thought

318
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:32,671
Okay so they're just going to Django

319
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:35,487
I bet you'd look a lot of globalist blocks

320
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:42,655
Fraud

321
00:17:43,935 --> 00:17:46,751
Specifically used in all sorts of

322
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:48,287
Nazi propaganda

323
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:52,127
Seems like a lot

324
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:53,919
You know it is

325
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:57,759
Kind of an understandable impulse

326
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:03,391
Do you know what I mean like it seems odd

327
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:06,207
Hundreds and hundreds of millions of people would just

328
00:18:06,975 --> 00:18:08,767
On their own

329
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:09,535
Choose

330
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:11,327
Fascinated by this

331
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:15,935
Like it's something that is a part of our culture

332
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:18,495
Except they're so the idea has to be

333
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:20,287
Well there's a reason for it

334
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:21,311
Instead of just

335
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:22,847
I want people like it

336
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:24,383
And it just kept growing

337
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:25,151
Our brains

338
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:27,711
Narrative

339
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:29,759
Someone doing

340
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:31,807
Something

341
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:32,575
All of us

342
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:33,343
Together

343
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:34,623
Independently

344
00:18:39,999 --> 00:18:40,511
Conspiracy to

345
00:18:42,047 --> 00:18:43,071
Need to organize things

346
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:46,399
In a way that fits fits in with that.

347
00:18:46,655 --> 00:18:47,679
The tendency of

348
00:18:47,935 --> 00:18:48,447
Your brain

349
00:18:49,983 --> 00:18:52,031
The protocols of the Elders of Zion are so Insidious

350
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:53,823
Is that it has that

351
00:18:55,871 --> 00:18:58,431
Roots real

352
00:18:58,687 --> 00:18:59,967
And then at the same time

353
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:01,503
Swatson so many

354
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:06,111
This is weird

355
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:11,487
It's a mess it's almost like an overlay you put on top of the world

356
00:19:12,511 --> 00:19:16,607
So on the 16th

357
00:19:16,863 --> 00:19:19,935
I was struck by

358
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:25,311
You forget about menu

359
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:26,847
You constantly relearn

360
00:19:27,103 --> 00:19:27,615
If you're paying

361
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:31,455
Become

362
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:36,831
Extremist religious preaching extremist right-wing talk

363
00:19:37,087 --> 00:19:38,623
Shrek it's so crazy

364
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:39,391
That you just

365
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:42,719
If you listen to his show a bunch of probably just

366
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:43,999
For granted the fact

367
00:19:45,023 --> 00:19:47,583
Supposed to be a political commentator

368
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:51,679
And he's on the air screaming about God in the literal devil all the time

369
00:19:51,935 --> 00:19:53,471
But it's very strange

370
00:19:53,727 --> 00:19:56,287
If you just allow it to exist on question

371
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:58,079
Like I was listening to this on my

372
00:19:58,335 --> 00:20:00,127
What the f*** is that how is this

373
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:01,919
How are people not

374
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:04,479
How do you not just see this be like

375
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:08,319
I could get the f*** out of here I signed up for libertarianism

376
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:11,135
I told I like I don't know what you're doing

377
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:13,183
You're talking about the f******

378
00:20:13,439 --> 00:20:13,951
Shoot devil

379
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:16,255
I can't I can't hang out anymore

380
00:20:17,023 --> 00:20:23,167
Situation

381
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:24,703
Incredible

382
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:32,639
We develop in the art box

383
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:35,455
We can destroy universes

384
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:39,295
Angel

385
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:41,087
Be there just service

386
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:46,975
That's why the Fallen one pizza

387
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:52,863
Fallen ones

388
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:10,783
Consciously understanding full spectrum

389
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:12,575
Spiritual deception

390
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:19,488
Meant to make us give up

391
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,792
So

392
00:21:22,816 --> 00:21:25,888
Like I said I can't stress enough how f****** weird it is just as

393
00:21:26,144 --> 00:21:26,656
Extremist

394
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:27,424
Religious

395
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:28,704
Fundamentalism

396
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:29,728
Paired with

397
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:30,752
Right-wing

398
00:21:31,008 --> 00:21:31,520
Extremist

399
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:33,056
Tendencies

400
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,896
I can't be clear about this

401
00:21:37,152 --> 00:21:38,176
It is not going well

402
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:44,320
No I usually end up with like

403
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,112
Not good

404
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:48,160
Yeah

405
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:50,208
Expresses his belief that the enemy

406
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,584
Are unrelentingly lion

407
00:21:57,632 --> 00:22:00,448
Documents at Alex's reference

408
00:22:00,704 --> 00:22:06,080
In the past I have a pretty good going to be found in any Declassified Ford Foundation

409
00:22:06,336 --> 00:22:07,872
Soros documents

410
00:22:08,128 --> 00:22:09,920
Similar ideas to show up

411
00:22:14,784 --> 00:22:20,928
Crazy protocols but how

412
00:22:21,184 --> 00:22:24,000
Is playing

413
00:22:24,256 --> 00:22:25,792
Universal protocol number two

414
00:22:26,048 --> 00:22:30,656
Where's the scotch

415
00:22:31,168 --> 00:22:36,800
In the hands of the states of today there is a great force that creates people

416
00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:38,080
Depressed the park

417
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:39,360
Play by the Press is to

418
00:22:39,616 --> 00:22:41,408
Requirements

419
00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:42,688
Be indispensable

420
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:47,040
Give voice to the complaints of the people and express into create discontent

421
00:22:47,296 --> 00:22:49,600
It isn't the media that the Triumph of freedom

422
00:22:50,112 --> 00:22:51,136
Finds Its incarnation

423
00:22:51,648 --> 00:22:52,672
But the goyim States

424
00:22:52,928 --> 00:22:54,976
Not knowing how to make use of this Force

425
00:22:55,232 --> 00:22:56,512
It is falling into our hands

426
00:22:57,024 --> 00:23:02,656
There's an entire section protocol 12

427
00:23:05,472 --> 00:23:11,616
I also prefer called number 3

428
00:23:11,872 --> 00:23:18,016
But they will be compelled to offer us international power of a nature that Viet position

429
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:20,320
Gradually to absorb all the

430
00:23:20,576 --> 00:23:21,600
State forces of the world

431
00:23:21,856 --> 00:23:23,136
Informa super government

432
00:23:23,648 --> 00:23:28,256
What you see here is a discussion of a plan to use the media that they've taken over

433
00:23:28,512 --> 00:23:30,816
To lie and deceive and manipulate

434
00:23:31,072 --> 00:23:34,656
An order that they shall be able to wear people down

435
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:36,448
To the point where they just give up

436
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:43,104
And allow them to create a world government without any need for Bloodshed exactly

437
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:44,384
Alex is talking about

438
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:48,224
I'm starting to work on a little bit of a theory

439
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:54,368
And I promise the rest of this episode isn't just being like haha Alex is a PT protocols

440
00:23:54,624 --> 00:23:55,648
Although that would be fun

441
00:23:55,904 --> 00:24:02,048
I thought about it I realized I realize how to be matically that would get really exhausted for the listener

442
00:24:02,304 --> 00:24:03,840
But I do want to point out

443
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,400
Are just a couple of insta

444
00:24:06,656 --> 00:24:08,192
From the first fifty

445
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:09,984
Keep minutes of one of his episodes

446
00:24:11,264 --> 00:24:13,568
And they very clearly traced back to The Prado

447
00:24:14,336 --> 00:24:16,640
And I'm starting to work on this. It whenever Alex

448
00:24:16,896 --> 00:24:18,688
Doesn't offer a source on something

449
00:24:18,944 --> 00:24:19,712
30 claims

450
00:24:19,968 --> 00:24:24,832
Classified or admitted he's just referencing the protocols of the Elders of Zion

451
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:27,648
But he knows that he can't openly start preaching about this

452
00:24:27,904 --> 00:24:28,416
Debunked 80

453
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:29,184
Cosmetics

454
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,744
Without losing all but the most

455
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,280
People in his face

456
00:24:33,536 --> 00:24:34,304
Which probably isn't

457
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:35,072
Enough to keep

458
00:24:35,328 --> 00:24:35,840
The bills paid

459
00:24:36,352 --> 00:24:36,864
So

460
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,144
He pretends

461
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,424
That there's some sort of

462
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:45,312
It's in the Congressional Record or whatever and then never site it

463
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:47,616
Because he's really just repeating

464
00:24:47,872 --> 00:24:48,384
Protocols

465
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:53,760
That's a theory I have I don't know is that true

466
00:24:54,016 --> 00:24:55,552
He brings up something in the future

467
00:24:55,808 --> 00:24:57,088
Classified

468
00:24:57,344 --> 00:24:59,904
Is it midday admitted back in the black

469
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:05,536
You're back at this era or whatever that I don't have a citation for and he's not specific about

470
00:25:05,792 --> 00:25:07,072
I'm going to see if it Tracy

471
00:25:07,328 --> 00:25:08,608
Is back to the protocols

472
00:25:08,864 --> 00:25:09,376
And I guarantee

473
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,424
I guarantee

474
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:12,448
Victor will at least

475
00:25:12,704 --> 00:25:15,520
Be some overlap 60%

476
00:25:16,032 --> 00:25:18,080
I think that's probably fair but

477
00:25:18,336 --> 00:25:18,848
At this point

478
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,128
Still iPod

479
00:25:20,384 --> 00:25:21,920
Not even fair to call it a theory

480
00:25:22,176 --> 00:25:24,480
I hypothesize

481
00:25:24,736 --> 00:25:28,576
And I will apply the scientific method

482
00:25:28,832 --> 00:25:30,880
This July 16th is Tuesday

483
00:25:31,136 --> 00:25:33,952
On Wednesday Trump has his rally where

484
00:25:34,208 --> 00:25:36,256
Things took a turn for the authoritarian

485
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:37,280
Fascistic

486
00:25:40,352 --> 00:25:42,656
But on Tuesday Alex is way ahead of the Curve

487
00:25:42,912 --> 00:25:43,424
Ant-Man

488
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,448
He is

489
00:25:45,472 --> 00:25:47,520
Just screaming about Ela Nail Bar

490
00:25:48,032 --> 00:25:48,800
Real heart

491
00:25:49,312 --> 00:25:50,592
It's pretty gross

492
00:25:50,848 --> 00:25:52,384
A lot of the time it's

493
00:25:53,408 --> 00:25:53,920
This whole

494
00:25:54,688 --> 00:25:55,200
Stringy

495
00:25:55,456 --> 00:25:56,224
Justin being like

496
00:25:56,992 --> 00:25:58,016
She comes from

497
00:25:58,272 --> 00:26:01,344
The high-class Somali bloodlines

498
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,880
And they're slavers

499
00:26:03,648 --> 00:26:04,416
And so he starts

500
00:26:04,672 --> 00:26:05,440
Trying to

501
00:26:05,696 --> 00:26:08,000
Scream about how Somalia was involved

502
00:26:08,256 --> 00:26:10,048
In the slave trade and Muslims are all

503
00:26:10,304 --> 00:26:11,328
The blame for slavery

504
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:12,608
Sure

505
00:26:13,376 --> 00:26:17,216
I'm not going to I'm not going to get into a ton of that but that's just sort of context

506
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:18,752
For some of these clips

507
00:26:19,264 --> 00:26:21,568
Is first one here Alex

508
00:26:21,824 --> 00:26:23,616
Is screaming about

509
00:26:29,248 --> 00:26:35,392
We're told our bad to remember that children was the opposite everyone tried to get in here because we treat women and children better

510
00:26:35,648 --> 00:26:41,792
To everybody else and that's the truth on Omar has a chip on her shoulder because she comes from us

511
00:26:42,304 --> 00:26:43,840
Orange hellhole

512
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:50,496
It's all about Conquest conqueror their own lusts for power so the somalis

513
00:26:50,752 --> 00:26:52,288
Toilet paper to wipe

514
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:53,824
Their asses

515
00:26:55,104 --> 00:26:57,920
They can't produce electricity

516
00:26:58,432 --> 00:27:02,528
Tell you every Somali Ivermectin

517
00:27:02,784 --> 00:27:08,928
They're God's chosen and they're going to take the world over and I'm going to learn from them

518
00:27:11,232 --> 00:27:13,024
You're about your inbred

519
00:27:14,816 --> 00:27:20,448
But he just say all somalis are a bunch of inbred crazy people

520
00:27:20,704 --> 00:27:22,496
Stuff like that

521
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:28,128
You can't say things like that but then pretend that you have a nuanced political point

522
00:27:28,384 --> 00:27:30,176
Note outright

523
00:27:30,432 --> 00:27:31,456
Racism

524
00:27:31,712 --> 00:27:35,552
That's just outright white supremacy white nationalism whatever

525
00:27:35,808 --> 00:27:37,344
Whatever label you want

526
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,112
To put on it

527
00:27:38,368 --> 00:27:43,488
It depending on what's the time

528
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:49,376
Yeah that's Stark I mean there's really nothing to even like if you hear somebody say that you just go okay

529
00:27:49,632 --> 00:27:50,144
You're done

530
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,680
I can't even imagine like a

531
00:27:51,936 --> 00:27:53,984
Straight newsperson complaining about

532
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,288
People of a certain ethnicity yelling at them on the

533
00:27:56,800 --> 00:28:02,944
Now that's part of it you all are a bunch of inbred crazy people

534
00:28:04,992 --> 00:28:07,040
Complaining about like

535
00:28:07,296 --> 00:28:12,672
Itself

536
00:28:12,928 --> 00:28:15,744
Crazy-house far gone

537
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,024
Alex's

538
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,048
We just

539
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:19,072
You know

540
00:28:19,584 --> 00:28:25,728
That criticism doesn't even land

541
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,616
Other complaints

542
00:28:31,872 --> 00:28:33,920
Representative Omar

543
00:28:34,176 --> 00:28:34,688
And here is

544
00:28:35,968 --> 00:28:36,992
I'm going to get into

545
00:28:38,272 --> 00:28:43,392
For Isis

546
00:28:47,232 --> 00:28:50,304
We let

547
00:28:50,816 --> 00:28:53,120
Scorpion

548
00:28:53,632 --> 00:28:59,776
Brown recluse a black widow rattlesnake bites you

549
00:29:06,432 --> 00:29:10,528
Doing that over that song

550
00:29:11,808 --> 00:29:16,416
Decorative trumpet already sent out

551
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:20,000
Alex is doing

552
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:28,192
Hi babe

553
00:29:28,448 --> 00:29:29,216
They're just trying to

554
00:29:30,496 --> 00:29:31,776
I mean

555
00:29:32,032 --> 00:29:35,616
I don't I don't understand how I could okay

556
00:29:36,384 --> 00:29:36,896
Like

557
00:29:37,152 --> 00:29:38,432
Can you do that

558
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,480
I don't think you can

559
00:29:40,736 --> 00:29:42,272
But it seems like this is a crime

560
00:29:42,528 --> 00:29:44,064
Incitement to violence

561
00:29:44,832 --> 00:29:50,976
Like he's admitted to Crime you know now on Thursday

562
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:58,144
Did that so he's bought I know

563
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:06,336
Charged with a crime I imagine myself in like one of those bodyswap comedies

564
00:30:06,592 --> 00:30:07,872
We're like I end up like

565
00:30:08,128 --> 00:30:09,920
Record scratches I end up in

566
00:30:10,176 --> 00:30:13,248
Did Trump's body welder

567
00:30:14,272 --> 00:30:15,296
How do you stop it

568
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:23,488
Cuz you definitely still feeding it and making it worse

569
00:30:23,744 --> 00:30:26,048
I think about that even a person with the best intentions

570
00:30:26,304 --> 00:30:28,096
Dropped into the circumstance like

571
00:30:28,864 --> 00:30:30,656
These people that you have

572
00:30:31,168 --> 00:30:32,960
You have fed and lied down

573
00:30:33,472 --> 00:30:34,752
Like they are not going to stop

574
00:30:36,288 --> 00:30:37,056
It's very scary

575
00:30:37,312 --> 00:30:39,616
No I remember specifically this

576
00:30:39,872 --> 00:30:41,152
Team from

577
00:30:41,664 --> 00:30:42,944
Speaker for the Dead

578
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:43,712
Sequel

579
00:30:46,528 --> 00:30:48,576
It may have been that whenever it may have been the one

580
00:30:50,368 --> 00:30:51,136
One of the main

581
00:30:51,904 --> 00:30:52,416
Starts

582
00:30:52,672 --> 00:30:53,952
Inciting all of these people

583
00:30:54,208 --> 00:30:55,488
Turning them into a mob and he's

584
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,304
He's describing it so well this feeling of

585
00:30:58,560 --> 00:30:59,328
Part of

586
00:31:00,352 --> 00:31:00,864
And almost like

587
00:31:01,376 --> 00:31:05,984
You just letting your will be become part of the mob will and how that feels really good

588
00:31:06,496 --> 00:31:07,008
And then

589
00:31:07,264 --> 00:31:09,056
He was use the one leading it and then it

590
00:31:09,312 --> 00:31:10,080
Just got out of control cuz

591
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:15,200
Once the mob is there it doesn't matter what an individual says or does

592
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:18,528
And so out of it you just realized

593
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:20,320
What have I done

594
00:31:20,576 --> 00:31:21,856
It's almost like you're you're

595
00:31:22,112 --> 00:31:22,880
Dissociate

596
00:31:23,136 --> 00:31:29,280
Are you from

597
00:31:29,536 --> 00:31:30,816
There's that feeling of like

598
00:31:31,072 --> 00:31:32,864
Becoming absorbed into the hole

599
00:31:36,704 --> 00:31:37,216
Is used

600
00:31:37,472 --> 00:31:37,984
So naked

601
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,264
Two Play-Doh dangerous

602
00:31:41,824 --> 00:31:43,872
Positive feelings you have a being absorbed

603
00:31:44,384 --> 00:31:45,408
Intergroup

604
00:31:45,664 --> 00:31:46,176
People

605
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,760
Because it feels so good and it's so powerful

606
00:31:50,784 --> 00:31:51,296
Can we do

607
00:31:51,808 --> 00:31:55,136
Real f*****-up things you can only Direct

608
00:31:55,648 --> 00:31:56,672
You can't control it

609
00:31:56,928 --> 00:31:59,488
So that isn't even that is.

610
00:31:59,744 --> 00:32:02,560
You know you can

611
00:32:03,072 --> 00:32:05,376
What kind of wood Alex's also do exact

612
00:32:05,888 --> 00:32:06,400
And qanon

613
00:32:06,656 --> 00:32:07,680
And it hopefully

614
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:12,288
I don't know just

615
00:32:12,544 --> 00:32:14,848
Did not Lobby prices

616
00:32:15,104 --> 00:32:15,616
She's not a terrorist

617
00:32:16,128 --> 00:32:19,200
Alex Jones is an over white nationalist who can't handle criticism

618
00:32:19,456 --> 00:32:20,224
Renata white person

619
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,760
It'll take any opportunity

620
00:32:22,272 --> 00:32:23,040
Scream bulshit

621
00:32:23,296 --> 00:32:25,344
Send it positions without making them

622
00:32:26,624 --> 00:32:27,904
In November 2016

623
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:33,280
I meant were on trial in Minneapolis for passports

624
00:32:33,536 --> 00:32:34,816
Presumably to train with ISIS

625
00:32:35,584 --> 00:32:36,864
These were young man and they were facing

626
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,400
30 to 40 years in prison

627
00:32:38,656 --> 00:32:39,168
For their crimes

628
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:45,312
As a newly elected Congress person in Minnesota ilhan Omar wrote to the judge not in an attempt to lobby for

629
00:32:45,824 --> 00:32:49,408
Approaching the situation from the perspective of restorative justice

630
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:51,200
As opposed to wanted punitive

631
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:56,320
She was one of Thirteen individuals or organizations that wrote To The Judge expressing this

632
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:00,416
In the letter she points out that incorporating these been for what amounts to

633
00:33:00,672 --> 00:33:01,952
To basically their whole lives

634
00:33:02,208 --> 00:33:02,720
In effect

635
00:33:02,976 --> 00:33:04,000
Helps terrorist recruit

636
00:33:05,792 --> 00:33:10,144
Society was no expectations of the to be 50 or 60 year old released prisoner

637
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:12,704
It will do that with distrust and revulsion

638
00:33:13,216 --> 00:33:16,032
Such punitive measures do not only lack ecstasy

639
00:33:16,544 --> 00:33:19,872
They inevitably create an environment in which extremism can flourish

640
00:33:20,128 --> 00:33:22,688
Aligning with the presuppositions of terrorist recruitment

641
00:33:22,944 --> 00:33:24,992
That is Americans do not accept you in

642
00:33:25,248 --> 00:33:27,808
Continue to AAA trivialize your value

643
00:33:28,064 --> 00:33:30,112
Instead of being a nobody be a martyr

644
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:31,904
She doesn't tell the judge

645
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,184
What they should do

646
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:36,768
Rather she offers a perspective that this sort of fanaticism

647
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:38,048
Forward

648
00:33:38,304 --> 00:33:40,608
Do uses the word fanaticism to describe these

649
00:33:41,376 --> 00:33:43,424
Can be fought most effectively with compassion

650
00:33:43,936 --> 00:33:48,032
The fanaticism grows out of feelings of systematic

651
00:33:48,544 --> 00:33:50,080
Which is why are we should all be working

652
00:33:50,336 --> 00:33:53,408
She doesn't save these men should not be held responsible

653
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:54,176
For their actions

654
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:56,992
Just if there's a better way to deal with it these situation

655
00:33:57,248 --> 00:33:58,784
Then by locking somebody up for deca

656
00:34:00,064 --> 00:34:05,184
I think the important point to really highlight here is that these men didn't commit any violent act they had.

657
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:07,232
Intention of joining a terrorist organization

658
00:34:07,488 --> 00:34:09,024
And that could mean that they're not

659
00:34:09,792 --> 00:34:11,328
The point of possible Rehabilitation

660
00:34:12,608 --> 00:34:14,912
Right you're welcome to have whatever feelings about that

661
00:34:15,168 --> 00:34:15,680
That you want

662
00:34:15,936 --> 00:34:17,728
That you can probably have

663
00:34:19,264 --> 00:34:21,568
It's a good idea to lock them up or it's a bad idea

664
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:22,592
Eric

665
00:34:22,848 --> 00:34:25,408
I think you'd probably have a reasonable argument

666
00:34:26,176 --> 00:34:28,224
You're not too far gone if you encourage

667
00:34:29,504 --> 00:34:33,344
Locking up people who make overtures to join a terrorist

668
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:35,392
I don't think that's beyond

669
00:34:35,648 --> 00:34:38,976
The payoff I disagree with that but I don't think you're a monster for thing

670
00:34:40,512 --> 00:34:41,792
It's entirely off base

671
00:34:42,048 --> 00:34:46,144
Use this story is proof that Elon Omar or support

672
00:34:46,912 --> 00:34:48,960
The Twist the story like this is to take a person's

673
00:34:49,216 --> 00:34:49,728
Compassion

674
00:34:49,984 --> 00:34:51,264
And use it as a weapon against

675
00:34:51,776 --> 00:34:53,824
Which is something that Alex would never be doing if

676
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:54,592
Omar was

677
00:34:55,616 --> 00:34:58,688
Alex constantly has Vox day on his show as a guest

678
00:34:58,944 --> 00:35:00,480
Who legitimately celebrate

679
00:35:00,736 --> 00:35:02,016
Terrorist Anders Breivik

680
00:35:02,272 --> 00:35:03,296
Is a freedom fighter

681
00:35:03,808 --> 00:35:04,576
Fredericton

682
00:35:04,832 --> 00:35:05,856
Plan something awful

683
00:35:06,368 --> 00:35:07,136
He killed tons

684
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:10,208
If Alex had any intellectual consistency

685
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:14,048
He could never endorse or give a platform to someone like Vox day

686
00:35:14,304 --> 00:35:17,376
It's simultaneously pretend that Omar's letter to a judge

687
00:35:17,632 --> 00:35:18,912
Is proof that she's a terror

688
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:20,448
He can do both

689
00:35:20,704 --> 00:35:22,496
Because he's a white supremacist

690
00:35:22,752 --> 00:35:25,824
Who is totally fine with white terrorism that's directed against the

691
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:28,384
What is multiculturalism

692
00:35:28,896 --> 00:35:29,664
And he believes that

693
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:34,272
Appeals to restorative justice where marginalized people are welcomed into the body of society

694
00:35:34,784 --> 00:35:36,320
Is an appeal to Terror

695
00:35:37,344 --> 00:35:38,112
It's just that simple

696
00:35:38,624 --> 00:35:39,904
You can make all this make sense

697
00:35:40,416 --> 00:35:44,256
Yeah it does make sense all you have to do is consider through the prism of

698
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:45,536
Yeah

699
00:35:45,792 --> 00:35:47,328
He's fine with white terrorism

700
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:50,400
Done by people who are afraid of multiculturalism

701
00:35:50,656 --> 00:35:51,424
East

702
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:55,776
That appeals to multiculturalism are in themselves terrorism

703
00:35:57,312 --> 00:35:59,616
I don't know because he's a f******

704
00:36:00,128 --> 00:36:01,920
Super white identity dude

705
00:36:02,176 --> 00:36:03,200
Yeah that's what it is

706
00:36:03,456 --> 00:36:06,528
I mean if you if you think that any encroachment

707
00:36:07,808 --> 00:36:08,832
Soupremacy

708
00:36:09,088 --> 00:36:09,600
A terrorist Act

709
00:36:09,856 --> 00:36:12,416
Yes I suppose in his

710
00:36:12,928 --> 00:36:14,976
How this makes exact

711
00:36:19,328 --> 00:36:20,608
Yeah

712
00:36:21,376 --> 00:36:22,656
Because his behavior

713
00:36:22,912 --> 00:36:24,192
Strongly implies

714
00:36:24,704 --> 00:36:28,032
Yeah I've always been I've always been confused as to why people do

715
00:36:28,288 --> 00:36:29,312
Understand why you would

716
00:36:32,896 --> 00:36:33,920
Very obvious

717
00:36:34,688 --> 00:36:35,712
Like okay

718
00:36:35,968 --> 00:36:41,344
Good decision America I was

719
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:43,904
I was 12 years old and America

720
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:44,672
Bomb device

721
00:36:44,928 --> 00:36:45,696
F****** home

722
00:36:45,952 --> 00:36:50,048
And my mom died and now I'm 17 I don't have any job I don't have anything

723
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:52,352
And I know that America Center bombed

724
00:36:52,608 --> 00:36:56,192
Large group of people who are chanting

725
00:36:57,216 --> 00:36:58,752
Xenophobic

726
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:01,568
President

727
00:37:01,824 --> 00:37:02,336
Stop them

728
00:37:02,592 --> 00:37:03,104
Exactly

729
00:37:04,384 --> 00:37:05,408
Reasonable

730
00:37:05,664 --> 00:37:06,944
It's not

731
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:07,968
It's not a good thing

732
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:14,112
I'm going to stop just short of calling you can understand

733
00:37:14,624 --> 00:37:15,392
Not it's

734
00:37:15,904 --> 00:37:17,440
You're able to

735
00:37:17,696 --> 00:37:21,280
Extend your brain

736
00:37:29,216 --> 00:37:29,728
But yes

737
00:37:30,240 --> 00:37:31,264
So Alex

738
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:35,360
Wants to yell a bunch about how the Muslims started the slave trade

739
00:37:35,616 --> 00:37:36,384
In

740
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:37,152
Somalia

741
00:37:37,408 --> 00:37:38,944
You get really mad

742
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:39,968
That

743
00:37:40,224 --> 00:37:40,992
You can't get a map

744
00:37:41,248 --> 00:37:42,528
The come up on his

745
00:37:43,296 --> 00:37:43,808
His

746
00:37:44,064 --> 00:37:46,880
Overhead cam

747
00:37:47,136 --> 00:37:48,672
Can start screaming while pointing

748
00:37:48,928 --> 00:37:51,232
At the backdrop he's got a map there

749
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:52,768
Google Maps

750
00:37:53,024 --> 00:37:54,048
Africa

751
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,064
Right there

752
00:38:28,864 --> 00:38:30,400
Pacific Ocean

753
00:38:31,936 --> 00:38:33,216
What's the temperature outside

754
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,336
Muhammad was a slaver

755
00:38:47,552 --> 00:38:48,576
History

756
00:38:52,928 --> 00:38:55,232
Shut up

757
00:39:02,656 --> 00:39:03,936
Well

758
00:39:04,192 --> 00:39:10,336
You just don't get that from MSNBC level of professionalism

759
00:39:11,872 --> 00:39:17,760
One of the reasons that they show ID I still appreciate

760
00:39:18,016 --> 00:39:22,624
Remind yourself

761
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:29,024
Just imagine Wolf Blitzer yelling about like walking away from his desk

762
00:39:30,304 --> 00:39:33,888
Make me feel.

763
00:39:34,912 --> 00:39:38,240
OverWatch to get to buy white man country

764
00:39:39,264 --> 00:39:45,408
It's insane to imagine the sort of behavior being done by literally anybody to him

765
00:39:45,664 --> 00:39:48,736
Type of relationship but not in the same way Tucker knows better

766
00:39:49,248 --> 00:39:51,040
He got get a trial by fire when

767
00:39:51,296 --> 00:39:52,320
You tried to do the bow tie

768
00:39:52,576 --> 00:39:53,088
4 years

769
00:39:53,344 --> 00:39:54,368
You realize like

770
00:39:54,624 --> 00:39:57,696
Don't f*** around it's not worth it

771
00:39:57,952 --> 00:39:58,720
Alex

772
00:39:59,488 --> 00:40:02,816
But that also was a testament to it like how much Alex's brand is

773
00:40:06,912 --> 00:40:11,008
Right like there's never a the he doesn't come in the next day like

774
00:40:13,056 --> 00:40:13,824
What the exception

775
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:15,872
Of maybe whenever

776
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:18,176
May or may not have threatened that

777
00:40:18,432 --> 00:40:19,712
Lawyer

778
00:40:19,968 --> 00:40:22,528
Required

779
00:40:23,552 --> 00:40:26,624
So if is Mexico if Alex talks more about these

780
00:40:27,392 --> 00:40:27,904
Slaves

781
00:40:28,928 --> 00:40:29,952
The world

782
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,536
How much

783
00:40:34,048 --> 00:40:34,816
America sucks

784
00:40:43,776 --> 00:40:44,800
Right over here

785
00:40:53,248 --> 00:40:55,296
Because of slave ships

786
00:40:55,552 --> 00:40:58,880
Alex would you like to open up a conversation about missionaries

787
00:41:02,464 --> 00:41:02,976
Fair enough

788
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,536
No no no

789
00:41:05,792 --> 00:41:08,864
Open up a conversation about you know tons of

790
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:15,264
The colonization efforts that were masquerading as planned

791
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:16,800
Really just

792
00:41:17,056 --> 00:41:18,336
Brutal exploitation in

793
00:41:18,592 --> 00:41:22,688
Resources

794
00:41:23,712 --> 00:41:24,992
Nobody is nobody is

795
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:28,064
The history of no one needs to feel

796
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:28,832
Guilty

797
00:41:29,344 --> 00:41:32,928
To move forward live together

798
00:41:33,184 --> 00:41:34,720
That's what we need to do

799
00:41:34,976 --> 00:41:37,280
Obsessing about the idea of feeling guilt

800
00:41:37,792 --> 00:41:38,560
About the long

801
00:41:38,816 --> 00:41:39,328
Distance

802
00:41:39,584 --> 00:41:40,096
Past

803
00:41:40,608 --> 00:41:42,656
Is only a way to not deal with these

804
00:41:42,912 --> 00:41:43,424
Right

805
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:44,448
That will keep these

806
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,496
The problem and that's what Alex wants

807
00:41:46,752 --> 00:41:47,520
There's a star

808
00:41:48,032 --> 00:41:49,824
There's a stark difference now as

809
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:50,848
Says it's kind of

810
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:53,151
As the question is becoming more and more

811
00:41:53,407 --> 00:41:53,919
Clear

812
00:41:54,175 --> 00:41:55,967
It's becoming more and more

813
00:41:58,015 --> 00:41:58,527
1

814
00:41:58,783 --> 00:42:00,063
One group

815
00:42:00,575 --> 00:42:01,855
Like alien Omar

816
00:42:02,111 --> 00:42:03,135
And

817
00:42:07,743 --> 00:42:08,511
Notice America

818
00:42:08,767 --> 00:42:09,279
His failures

819
00:42:09,535 --> 00:42:10,815
And use that information

820
00:42:11,071 --> 00:42:11,583
Into Improvement

821
00:42:12,095 --> 00:42:13,119
That's the idea

822
00:42:13,631 --> 00:42:14,911
And then the other choice

823
00:42:15,423 --> 00:42:17,471
They are trying to improve America

824
00:42:17,727 --> 00:42:19,007
Sing everybody

825
00:42:19,519 --> 00:42:21,055
Yeah that's it

826
00:42:21,311 --> 00:42:23,871
There's a visions of the future and wanted

827
00:42:25,151 --> 00:42:25,663
Hopeful

828
00:42:25,919 --> 00:42:26,431
Unwanted

829
00:42:27,967 --> 00:42:28,479
Darkened

830
00:42:30,015 --> 00:42:33,087
Emma's next CLEP Alex fits more stuff about Omar

831
00:42:35,135 --> 00:42:36,159
I mean I know it's not

832
00:42:36,671 --> 00:42:37,439
Why do I say

833
00:42:37,695 --> 00:42:39,231
I know the title

834
00:42:39,487 --> 00:42:40,511
Flavors

835
00:42:41,023 --> 00:42:42,303
Out of Somalia

836
00:42:42,559 --> 00:42:45,119
What does he talk about boobies

837
00:42:45,375 --> 00:42:49,215
Pirates

838
00:42:49,471 --> 00:42:54,079
Is it about the idea that people think you talk about titties

839
00:42:54,591 --> 00:42:55,615
Talk about that video

840
00:42:56,127 --> 00:42:56,639
Spell consist

841
00:42:57,151 --> 00:42:58,687
He loves using the word boobies

842
00:42:59,199 --> 00:43:00,991
But also knows there's like

843
00:43:02,527 --> 00:43:08,671
I got to make sure they know that I'm not a blue-footed booby

844
00:43:08,927 --> 00:43:10,975
Get your mind out of the gutter

845
00:43:11,231 --> 00:43:12,767
It's not you could just

846
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:17,119
And they have a right to rule

847
00:43:17,375 --> 00:43:18,399
Ml

848
00:43:18,655 --> 00:43:21,215
Enel kidnapped

849
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:26,079
Are you a racist

850
00:43:39,391 --> 00:43:42,975
So I mean all you could see here is just a building up of

851
00:43:43,999 --> 00:43:45,023
The Narrative against her

852
00:43:45,791 --> 00:43:46,303
Yep

853
00:43:47,071 --> 00:43:49,631
Will you see this on the Tuesday and then Wednesday

854
00:43:50,911 --> 00:43:54,239
See Trump's rally it's not to the other it's

855
00:43:54,495 --> 00:43:56,031
They were living in a

856
00:43:56,287 --> 00:43:56,799
Appointed

857
00:43:57,055 --> 00:43:57,567
Acceleration

858
00:43:58,079 --> 00:43:58,847
Surroundings

859
00:43:59,103 --> 00:44:01,407
Yep and the targeting of this woman

860
00:44:01,663 --> 00:44:02,687
Is so severe

861
00:44:03,199 --> 00:44:04,479
Yeah so scary

862
00:44:08,063 --> 00:44:09,343
So in his next life Alex

863
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:10,879
Let's talk more about her letter

864
00:44:11,135 --> 00:44:11,903
But you sent to this judge

865
00:44:13,439 --> 00:44:17,023
And I want to point out that there are just factual lies

866
00:44:17,535 --> 00:44:18,047
How do you say

867
00:44:19,071 --> 00:44:21,375
Flashlight

868
00:44:21,631 --> 00:44:25,215
Etax.com

869
00:44:25,983 --> 00:44:28,031
Flashback Bradford

870
00:44:35,967 --> 00:44:36,991
Judge

871
00:44:38,015 --> 00:44:41,087
To show Mercy to Isis terrorist

872
00:44:42,367 --> 00:44:43,903
The story

873
00:44:44,671 --> 00:44:47,999
Attention

874
00:44:49,279 --> 00:44:50,303
That

875
00:44:50,559 --> 00:44:52,095
These individuals were

876
00:44:54,399 --> 00:44:55,423
Freedom Fighters

877
00:44:57,727 --> 00:44:58,239
Feeble

878
00:45:03,103 --> 00:45:04,895
Shantae their freedom fighters

879
00:45:05,151 --> 00:45:08,479
Today is a freedom fighter

880
00:45:08,735 --> 00:45:09,503
Literally

881
00:45:10,271 --> 00:45:11,039
So I

882
00:45:11,295 --> 00:45:13,855
She doesn't she didn't say that you called them

883
00:45:15,903 --> 00:45:17,183
Is fanaticism

884
00:45:17,439 --> 00:45:18,463
Call the extremism

885
00:45:19,231 --> 00:45:21,535
So this is just factually inaccurate

886
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:25,375
You would make that kind of factual yet accurate

887
00:45:25,631 --> 00:45:29,471
Is if you were more interested in the perception that you painting

888
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:31,007
As opposed to the reality

889
00:45:31,263 --> 00:45:32,031
Which is very key

890
00:45:33,055 --> 00:45:36,895
Alex just talked about how

891
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:39,199
From Somali royalty

892
00:45:39,711 --> 00:45:42,527
And that her family it was involved enslaving

893
00:45:43,039 --> 00:45:45,343
I don't speak to anything

894
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:46,367
Other than

895
00:45:46,623 --> 00:45:47,647
Her skin color

896
00:45:47,903 --> 00:45:51,743
And he says literally that she doesn't look like other African

897
00:45:52,767 --> 00:45:53,535
Right

898
00:45:53,791 --> 00:45:57,119
So he said he uses that as sort of his defense for why he thinks that

899
00:45:57,375 --> 00:45:59,679
When she comes from higher class Somali stock

900
00:46:00,191 --> 00:46:01,727
Which is not good

901
00:46:02,751 --> 00:46:08,895
Is he actually just trying to say that she's of fair-skinned which is why

902
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:15,039
No evidence

903
00:46:16,063 --> 00:46:18,111
To defend these claim

904
00:46:20,671 --> 00:46:22,719
British

905
00:46:23,231 --> 00:46:28,607
200 years ago and I know somalis have all those big castles and it's life shift

906
00:46:30,143 --> 00:46:31,167
Serums

907
00:46:31,679 --> 00:46:37,823
You know you're from the upper ruling are the class everything is going to be going to show Oswego

908
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:43,455
I am Somalia Royals today

909
00:46:46,783 --> 00:46:50,367
My American red white blue petunias

910
00:46:51,647 --> 00:46:53,439
That a big old Selassie

911
00:46:53,695 --> 00:46:54,975
Bacon burger for yourself

912
00:46:56,767 --> 00:46:57,535
Seeing Lee

913
00:46:57,791 --> 00:46:58,559
Offense

914
00:46:59,327 --> 00:47:02,911
The amount it's the size of a peanut beer

915
00:47:03,167 --> 00:47:04,191
Impression that he's doing

916
00:47:04,447 --> 00:47:06,495
The fact that his brain immediately ghost

917
00:47:06,751 --> 00:47:08,287
To have a big old bacon burger

918
00:47:08,799 --> 00:47:11,871
This is hateful

919
00:47:14,175 --> 00:47:14,943
We get sort of

920
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:16,735
Ostial on Omar business

921
00:47:17,759 --> 00:47:18,271
Because Alex

922
00:47:19,039 --> 00:47:20,063
Coming back from break

923
00:47:20,575 --> 00:47:21,855
He's a real weird mood

924
00:47:22,367 --> 00:47:24,159
Terrifying profit

925
00:47:24,927 --> 00:47:25,439
Of what's to come

926
00:47:26,719 --> 00:47:31,839
I was thinking this morning when I saw that flesh eating bacteria is spreading all over the US from illegal aliens

927
00:47:40,543 --> 00:47:46,175
Barbosa going to release a bio-weapon more than blowing up

928
00:47:56,927 --> 00:47:57,695
Amish witches

929
00:48:01,791 --> 00:48:02,303
Do it

930
00:48:04,095 --> 00:48:04,863
EXO

931
00:48:05,887 --> 00:48:11,007
Intelligence agencies right now smell by attack

932
00:48:13,311 --> 00:48:18,687
Giant right wing attack on some groups with a whole bunch of right-wing patches that he was false flag

933
00:48:19,455 --> 00:48:23,295
They don't want us there when they have witnesses

934
00:48:23,551 --> 00:48:24,831
What happened

935
00:48:28,159 --> 00:48:33,023
Showing his cards a little bit worried that they receive in the present

936
00:48:33,279 --> 00:48:35,583
Or probably I mean you know you see that

937
00:48:35,839 --> 00:48:37,631
These caches of weapons that are found

938
00:48:37,887 --> 00:48:38,399
You see these groups

939
00:48:39,935 --> 00:48:43,007
Recognizes on some level they probably going

940
00:48:43,263 --> 00:48:45,055
To be a rash of right-wing violence

941
00:48:45,567 --> 00:48:46,079
There's a decent

942
00:48:48,639 --> 00:48:49,919
And no

943
00:48:50,175 --> 00:48:50,943
Probably have that is

944
00:48:51,199 --> 00:48:51,711
The park

945
00:48:51,967 --> 00:48:52,479
Is just in case

946
00:48:52,735 --> 00:48:54,271
Such

947
00:48:54,527 --> 00:48:56,319
Man that cheating

948
00:48:56,575 --> 00:48:57,343
You know

949
00:48:57,599 --> 00:49:00,159
F****** T800 career

950
00:49:02,207 --> 00:49:05,535
I feel I feel helpless in the face of somebody who is

951
00:49:05,791 --> 00:49:06,559
Actively

952
00:49:06,815 --> 00:49:07,583
Inspiring and

953
00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:08,607
Inciting violence

954
00:49:08,863 --> 00:49:10,911
Narrative

955
00:49:11,167 --> 00:49:12,447
Saying that when that violin

956
00:49:12,703 --> 00:49:14,239
Has carried out it has nothing

957
00:49:14,495 --> 00:49:15,007
To do with

958
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:17,311
And we'll all be just passed

959
00:49:20,127 --> 00:49:20,895
It's terrible

960
00:49:21,151 --> 00:49:26,527
Here we signed Alex once again spread

961
00:49:26,783 --> 00:49:29,343
He talking point about immigrants being the carriers of disease

962
00:49:30,111 --> 00:49:33,439
Unfortunately his dumbass

963
00:49:33,695 --> 00:49:34,207
Complete flop

964
00:49:37,535 --> 00:49:38,559
The flesh eating bacteria

965
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:42,143
Flesh-eating bacteria is a condition that's very scary

966
00:49:42,399 --> 00:49:44,959
Centivax very rapidly spreading

967
00:49:45,215 --> 00:49:45,983
Decaying of your flesh

968
00:49:46,239 --> 00:49:49,311
It's visually really f*****

969
00:49:50,335 --> 00:49:51,103
Visceral

970
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:52,639
In the same way

971
00:49:52,895 --> 00:49:57,247
Perfect condition to attach to the population

972
00:49:58,783 --> 00:50:03,391
According to the CDC since 2010 between 712

973
00:50:03,647 --> 00:50:05,439
Condition occur annually in the United

974
00:50:06,463 --> 00:50:10,303
And here's the thing to everyone who knows anything about flesh eating bacteria nose

975
00:50:10,815 --> 00:50:13,375
Most of the reports of it happened during the summer

976
00:50:13,887 --> 00:50:14,399
Why

977
00:50:14,655 --> 00:50:19,519
Because almost everyone catches flesh eating bacteria from swimming or falling into warm water

978
00:50:20,031 --> 00:50:20,543
When Alex

979
00:50:24,383 --> 00:50:25,151
The summer

980
00:50:25,407 --> 00:50:27,199
What is the arbitrarily decide to blame it on

981
00:50:27,455 --> 00:50:27,967
Immigrant

982
00:50:28,479 --> 00:50:33,343
Because even over white nationalist would blame immigrants or anything he felt he could get away with

983
00:50:34,367 --> 00:50:38,463
A quick look through the stories about flesh eating bacteria from recent days show a clear trend

984
00:50:38,975 --> 00:50:42,047
Nashville been contracted flesh eating bacteria while kayaking

985
00:50:42,303 --> 00:50:44,863
Virginia woman recovering from flesh eating bacteria

986
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:47,935
She said she's recovering after she went swimming in Norfolk

987
00:50:48,703 --> 00:50:53,055
Milton woman contracted flesh-eating bacteria after scalloping in Port st.joe

988
00:50:53,311 --> 00:50:54,079
You're the tough one

989
00:50:54,335 --> 00:50:54,847
From CBS

990
00:50:55,359 --> 00:50:57,407
Quote Florida man contracts

991
00:50:57,663 --> 00:50:58,431
Eating bacteria without you

992
00:50:58,687 --> 00:50:59,455
Even touching the water

993
00:51:03,551 --> 00:51:07,903
However if you read the article in the fourth paragraph you got a clue of what might be up

994
00:51:08,159 --> 00:51:13,023
Tyler King

995
00:51:13,535 --> 00:51:16,607
I've got a small theory on it how that guy

996
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:17,887
No

997
00:51:18,399 --> 00:51:18,911
God dammit

998
00:51:19,423 --> 00:51:20,191
Anyone who isn't

999
00:51:20,447 --> 00:51:23,775
Demonize immigrants would never blame an uptick in reports of

1000
00:51:24,031 --> 00:51:26,591
Flesh eating bacteria in the summer on immigrants

1001
00:51:27,103 --> 00:51:29,663
They would know that this is a very well understood phenomenon

1002
00:51:29,919 --> 00:51:31,199
It happens every year

1003
00:51:31,711 --> 00:51:33,759
Alex f****** care about the truth

1004
00:51:35,039 --> 00:51:35,807
Disgraceful

1005
00:51:36,063 --> 00:51:38,623
Embarrassing

1006
00:51:39,135 --> 00:51:41,183
Disseminating there is no two ways about it

1007
00:51:41,951 --> 00:51:43,487
I just to make this very blunt

1008
00:51:43,743 --> 00:51:45,023
The CDC is very clear

1009
00:51:45,535 --> 00:51:48,863
Quote it's very rare for someone with necrotizing fasciitis

1010
00:51:49,375 --> 00:51:50,911
Spread the infection to other

1011
00:51:51,679 --> 00:51:55,775
It's not considered a condition that has a risk of being highly transmittable person-to-person

1012
00:51:56,287 --> 00:52:01,151
They don't even routinely prescribed antibiotics for people who are in close proximity to people

1013
00:52:01,407 --> 00:52:02,175
Because it just doesn't

1014
00:52:02,431 --> 00:52:03,199
Spread that way

1015
00:52:03,455 --> 00:52:06,015
It spreads from people who are at risk

1016
00:52:06,271 --> 00:52:07,551
Swimming in warm water

1017
00:52:08,063 --> 00:52:10,879
When you talk about it risk certain conditions

1018
00:52:11,135 --> 00:52:13,951
Like you know having cirrhosis

1019
00:52:14,207 --> 00:52:14,719
To the liver

1020
00:52:14,975 --> 00:52:17,535
Diabetes make you at higher risk

1021
00:52:17,791 --> 00:52:19,583
Of getting the bacteria but then

1022
00:52:19,839 --> 00:52:21,375
Time if you have an open wound

1023
00:52:21,631 --> 00:52:22,399
Or if you fall in

1024
00:52:22,655 --> 00:52:25,727
You get cut by something you have a higher risk

1025
00:52:25,983 --> 00:52:26,495
Right

1026
00:52:26,751 --> 00:52:29,823
Serious researchers are concerned that we're seeing an uptick in cases

1027
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:32,383
Is a bacteria but it's not because of immigrants

1028
00:52:32,895 --> 00:52:33,663
It's because of climate

1029
00:52:34,687 --> 00:52:40,575
As water temperatures rise the amount of time the ocean water is at a temperature where the bacteria can live and reproduce

1030
00:52:40,831 --> 00:52:41,343
Increases

1031
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:43,903
Which in turn increases the chances of someone catching it

1032
00:52:44,671 --> 00:52:47,487
Even so it's not something that most people should worry about all that much

1033
00:52:47,999 --> 00:52:50,303
Cases of people who don't have open wounds a preexisting

1034
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:53,119
Think addition to put them at risk catching flesh eating bacteria

1035
00:52:53,375 --> 00:52:53,887
RX

1036
00:52:54,143 --> 00:52:54,655
Eating lire

1037
00:53:02,335 --> 00:53:02,847
Against

1038
00:53:03,359 --> 00:53:05,407
It's very clear A2B

1039
00:53:05,919 --> 00:53:06,943
There's no two ways

1040
00:53:07,455 --> 00:53:07,967
Yeah it's

1041
00:53:08,479 --> 00:53:10,015
F***** up that's the

1042
00:53:10,527 --> 00:53:11,295
Entire

1043
00:53:11,551 --> 00:53:12,831
Republican policies

1044
00:53:14,623 --> 00:53:15,903
Make the world worse

1045
00:53:17,183 --> 00:53:17,951
And then

1046
00:53:18,207 --> 00:53:20,511
The people who are running interference

1047
00:53:20,767 --> 00:53:21,535
The propaganda for it

1048
00:53:22,047 --> 00:53:24,095
Blame all that s*** not on the Republic

1049
00:53:24,351 --> 00:53:25,119
Policy platform

1050
00:53:25,375 --> 00:53:26,143
But on immigrants

1051
00:53:26,399 --> 00:53:27,167
And Sprite

1052
00:53:27,423 --> 00:53:28,959
Making the world at workplace

1053
00:53:29,215 --> 00:53:32,031
And then making the world a worse place allows them to

1054
00:53:32,287 --> 00:53:32,799
To blame

1055
00:53:33,567 --> 00:53:34,335
Immigrants from

1056
00:53:34,591 --> 00:53:35,103
Making the world

1057
00:53:35,359 --> 00:53:37,151
Play Perpetual vacation

1058
00:53:37,407 --> 00:53:38,175
Machine

1059
00:53:38,431 --> 00:53:40,223
So Jordan at this point on the 16th

1060
00:53:40,479 --> 00:53:40,991
Pier

1061
00:53:41,247 --> 00:53:42,015
Alex have a gun

1062
00:53:42,783 --> 00:53:43,807
Almost

1063
00:53:44,063 --> 00:53:44,575
Gas

1064
00:53:45,087 --> 00:53:46,623
When I heard who it was

1065
00:53:58,911 --> 00:54:01,727
Who cares Kaitlin Bennett I want to say very clearly

1066
00:54:01,983 --> 00:54:06,847
That like that I generally prefer these episodes is

1067
00:54:07,103 --> 00:54:09,663
I will listen to Alex and when he says something really

1068
00:54:09,919 --> 00:54:11,967
Substantial episode

1069
00:54:12,479 --> 00:54:15,551
Digging to the things that he's saying and then move on

1070
00:54:16,063 --> 00:54:17,855
So are you already written

1071
00:54:19,135 --> 00:54:20,927
Researched all the stuff about

1072
00:54:21,439 --> 00:54:27,583
Alana Omar in her letter to the judge

1073
00:54:27,839 --> 00:54:32,703
Sunvox day f****** shows up yeah

1074
00:54:32,959 --> 00:54:39,103
I can't believe that he's the best examples that refutes Alex's position about what he was saying earlier

1075
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:40,895
Episode

1076
00:54:41,151 --> 00:54:44,223
8 very bizarre it's almost like he's

1077
00:54:44,479 --> 00:54:50,623
F****** with you you are making this happen

1078
00:54:50,879 --> 00:54:53,951
Episode 9 we do a modern-day episode mate

1079
00:54:54,207 --> 00:54:57,023
Can perfectly

1080
00:54:57,279 --> 00:55:00,863
Okay are we living in a simulation where you're actually the main character

1081
00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:05,471
I hope not it's terrible job

1082
00:55:05,983 --> 00:55:08,543
Appreciating the circumstances for myself to begin

1083
00:55:08,799 --> 00:55:13,151
This isn't what I would choose a lot of people have a little bit of self-flagellation in

1084
00:55:13,663 --> 00:55:14,175
Yeah baby

1085
00:55:16,479 --> 00:55:18,271
Vox day one of the things he wants

1086
00:55:18,527 --> 00:55:24,415
He wants to spend a good amount of time complaining about Alexandria ocasio-cortez

1087
00:55:24,671 --> 00:55:25,695
Rashida tlaib

1088
00:55:25,951 --> 00:55:31,839
Call Bart.

1089
00:55:32,095 --> 00:55:34,399
People that are real

1090
00:55:34,655 --> 00:55:35,167
F******

1091
00:55:35,423 --> 00:55:37,471
Scared

1092
00:55:37,727 --> 00:55:39,775
Eddie says a couple things that I

1093
00:55:40,031 --> 00:55:40,543
Cinco just like

1094
00:55:42,335 --> 00:55:48,479
Being born in the United States doesn't make anyone an American anymore than being born in a manger

1095
00:55:48,735 --> 00:55:50,015
Jeremy Jesus Christ account

1096
00:55:51,039 --> 00:55:53,343
And the idea that the is Magic

1097
00:55:53,599 --> 00:55:55,135
The idea that geography

1098
00:55:55,647 --> 00:55:58,207
Determines genetics and nationality

1099
00:55:58,463 --> 00:55:58,975
It is a

1100
00:56:00,767 --> 00:56:03,071
Literally every major thinker

1101
00:56:03,327 --> 00:56:06,399
Dating back to the Chinese sages would have laughed at

1102
00:56:06,911 --> 00:56:13,055
You're on real dangerous territory here when you are like yes we're all citizens but some of us are more citizens

1103
00:56:13,311 --> 00:56:19,455
Yeah especially when you're specifically talking about for congress people of

1104
00:56:19,711 --> 00:56:22,015
Color

1105
00:56:22,271 --> 00:56:23,039
Really f******

1106
00:56:23,295 --> 00:56:23,807
Dangerous

1107
00:56:24,319 --> 00:56:24,831
Bad idea

1108
00:56:25,343 --> 00:56:31,231
Good once you introduce that it's possible that there's levels of citizenship

1109
00:56:31,487 --> 00:56:37,631
Course they're all citizens but they're not American

1110
00:56:38,911 --> 00:56:41,215
Comparable a level

1111
00:56:41,471 --> 00:56:42,751
But apart

1112
00:56:43,007 --> 00:56:48,639
What I'm saying is we want to be apart from each other but also equally separate but equal

1113
00:56:48,895 --> 00:56:51,967
Adolphe beef

1114
00:56:52,223 --> 00:56:52,735
Thrilled

1115
00:56:53,247 --> 00:56:54,527
About Trump in his camp

1116
00:56:55,295 --> 00:56:57,087
Because what comes next

1117
00:56:57,599 --> 00:56:58,879
If he doesn't do this

1118
00:56:59,135 --> 00:57:00,159
Will be way worse

1119
00:57:00,927 --> 00:57:01,439
Which is

1120
00:57:02,463 --> 00:57:05,535
Kind of f***** up but then the way Alex responds to it I think is even

1121
00:57:05,791 --> 00:57:07,327
More f***** up and indicates

1122
00:57:07,839 --> 00:57:09,375
He knows what's going on

1123
00:57:09,887 --> 00:57:10,399
You f****** Intuit

1124
00:57:11,167 --> 00:57:13,215
For those who are concerned that

1125
00:57:13,727 --> 00:57:19,103
Trump is an extremist in putting people in concentration camps

1126
00:57:20,639 --> 00:57:21,663
They had better

1127
00:57:22,687 --> 00:57:23,967
Embrace and accept

1128
00:57:24,223 --> 00:57:26,015
Endorse and support

1129
00:57:26,271 --> 00:57:26,783
His

1130
00:57:27,295 --> 00:57:29,343
Boomer Civic nationalism

1131
00:57:29,599 --> 00:57:30,367
Because

1132
00:57:30,623 --> 00:57:35,743
They're really going to like what comes after that a lot less whether it's from the left

1133
00:57:36,255 --> 00:57:37,279
Or from the right

1134
00:57:37,791 --> 00:57:38,559
Because

1135
00:57:39,583 --> 00:57:40,351
The history of

1136
00:57:40,607 --> 00:57:45,983
Human migration has always been accompanied by large-scale Warren balkanization

1137
00:57:46,495 --> 00:57:50,335
Recognizes this and he's attempting to get in the way of it

1138
00:57:50,591 --> 00:57:52,895
Everybody

1139
00:57:53,151 --> 00:57:59,295
Describe that versus a fastest model which will probably go towards

1140
00:58:01,343 --> 00:58:06,719
So he's basically saying is probably coming but it's also the left

1141
00:58:06,975 --> 00:58:08,767
Fault we're the ones

1142
00:58:09,279 --> 00:58:10,303
Causing right-wing fashion

1143
00:58:10,815 --> 00:58:16,959
Play it's a good way to be like people on the left have been warning that looks like your head

1144
00:58:20,287 --> 00:58:24,895
Hey you know you call people racist long enough they're going to f****** start throwing the n-word around

1145
00:58:25,151 --> 00:58:31,295
You're going to make them races ya calling them racist

1146
00:58:33,855 --> 00:58:35,903
Cuz of that you've made me a fascist

1147
00:58:36,159 --> 00:58:41,023
What am I supposed to do you called me at enough like f*** you yeah I am alright

1148
00:58:41,535 --> 00:58:44,863
What we should have done what we should have done is nothing

1149
00:58:45,119 --> 00:58:47,679
And then allowed them to create it on their own

1150
00:58:48,191 --> 00:58:49,215
I met wait no

1151
00:58:49,471 --> 00:58:50,751
We still get to right-wing fast

1152
00:58:51,263 --> 00:58:55,359
Kind of literally is going to be

1153
00:58:55,615 --> 00:58:56,383
You're right

1154
00:58:59,199 --> 00:58:59,967
It's a trap

1155
00:59:00,223 --> 00:59:04,575
Who admires a brevik

1156
00:59:07,135 --> 00:59:08,927
Not a small detail

1157
00:59:09,183 --> 00:59:09,951
About this s*** head

1158
00:59:11,231 --> 00:59:13,279
He has this to say about

1159
00:59:13,791 --> 00:59:14,559
Congress

1160
00:59:15,839 --> 00:59:17,119
Reiterating

1161
00:59:18,143 --> 00:59:24,287
The fact that he's willing to take on these issues publicly the fact that he's willing to take the media's Overton window and smashed

1162
00:59:24,543 --> 00:59:26,079
Completely with regards to

1163
00:59:26,591 --> 00:59:28,127
The fact that these

1164
00:59:28,383 --> 00:59:31,455
Women are not Americans and do not belong there

1165
00:59:31,711 --> 00:59:32,991
Again they're US citizens

1166
00:59:33,503 --> 00:59:38,367
But they're not Americans by any definition of family

1167
00:59:38,879 --> 00:59:42,207
So there an enemy with it within

1168
00:59:42,463 --> 00:59:42,975
F***

1169
00:59:43,231 --> 00:59:43,743
Right

1170
00:59:43,999 --> 00:59:48,863
Will I be presented all he wants is like they hate the

1171
00:59:50,143 --> 00:59:52,703
What I'm actually talking about it's not something else

1172
00:59:53,215 --> 00:59:54,239
So nebulous

1173
00:59:54,751 --> 00:59:55,263
Impossible to

1174
00:59:55,519 --> 00:59:56,031
Define

1175
00:59:56,287 --> 00:59:57,567
Like the idea

1176
00:59:57,823 --> 01:00:00,639
Any sort of criticism of the country

1177
01:00:00,895 --> 01:00:03,455
Is makes you not an American citizen

1178
01:00:03,711 --> 01:00:04,223
Goodnight America

1179
01:00:04,735 --> 01:00:05,247
I would say

1180
01:00:07,551 --> 01:00:08,319
Trump got elected

1181
01:00:08,831 --> 01:00:09,343
Alex

1182
01:00:09,599 --> 01:00:10,879
Is then condemning himself

1183
01:00:11,391 --> 01:00:14,719
Well yeah but

1184
01:00:14,975 --> 01:00:21,119
Real American

1185
01:00:21,375 --> 01:00:27,519
Occupied government

1186
01:00:28,287 --> 01:00:33,151
Is there a was there fog today were making him be on American Dad

1187
01:00:33,407 --> 01:00:35,455
Trying to get that sense that everything is someone else's

1188
01:00:38,015 --> 01:00:41,855
Longer conversations

1189
01:00:42,111 --> 01:00:45,183
F****** stupid and Alex trying to sell voxspace comic book

1190
01:00:45,439 --> 01:00:46,975
And to that end

1191
01:00:47,743 --> 01:00:48,767
We we get now into

1192
01:00:49,023 --> 01:00:49,535
The 17th

1193
01:00:50,047 --> 01:00:50,815
And Alex

1194
01:00:51,071 --> 01:00:54,399
First hour of his show on something

1195
01:00:54,655 --> 01:00:55,423
I find

1196
01:00:56,703 --> 01:00:58,751
One of the more disturbing

1197
01:00:59,007 --> 01:01:00,287
Things it's Loki

1198
01:01:00,543 --> 01:01:01,311
Incredibly disturbing

1199
01:01:01,567 --> 01:01:03,359
It may not appear to be immediate

1200
01:01:04,383 --> 01:01:05,151
I think I can

1201
01:01:05,407 --> 01:01:06,431
Explain why

1202
01:01:06,943 --> 01:01:07,711
It has to do with the

1203
01:01:09,759 --> 01:01:10,783
Detention centers

1204
01:01:11,039 --> 01:01:11,807
For immigrants

1205
01:01:13,599 --> 01:01:14,367
And the Border Patrol

1206
01:01:15,135 --> 01:01:15,647
Alex

1207
01:01:15,903 --> 01:01:17,951
Nuremberg

1208
01:01:18,207 --> 01:01:18,975
I assume we'll see

1209
01:01:19,487 --> 01:01:20,511
Alex's found a video

1210
01:01:20,767 --> 01:01:21,279
Candace Owens

1211
01:01:21,535 --> 01:01:22,303
Put out

1212
01:01:22,559 --> 01:01:23,583
A is him introducing

1213
01:01:27,167 --> 01:01:29,727
Where she singing with the two of the most anybody has ever done

1214
01:01:30,239 --> 01:01:32,543
USA

1215
01:01:48,927 --> 01:01:53,791
So you can hear Alex things that she came out with this video she's not with turning points

1216
01:01:54,047 --> 01:01:55,839
USA anymore she's filming this on her own

1217
01:01:56,095 --> 01:01:57,887
He's presenting this like a current video

1218
01:01:58,655 --> 01:01:59,423
What up

1219
01:01:59,679 --> 01:02:02,751
Video is from

1220
01:02:03,007 --> 01:02:03,775
2018

1221
01:02:05,055 --> 01:02:11,199
It was posted on her Facebook on September 7th 2018 I assumed was streamed live because she does mention that

1222
01:02:12,223 --> 01:02:14,015
So this is in no way current news

1223
01:02:14,527 --> 01:02:17,855
Also she went to a nice facility in Broward County Florida

1224
01:02:18,111 --> 01:02:22,719
Announces using it to somehow refute the argument that AOC

1225
01:02:22,975 --> 01:02:24,767
The detention centers on our border

1226
01:02:25,279 --> 01:02:27,839
The only thing Florida borders is the water

1227
01:02:28,607 --> 01:02:29,887
That's where they get all that flesh eating

1228
01:02:31,679 --> 01:02:34,239
Arkansas video proves literally nothing

1229
01:02:34,495 --> 01:02:37,567
And neither do the Clips Alex shows to try and build help build her case

1230
01:02:38,079 --> 01:02:39,103
For reasons I'll explain later

1231
01:02:39,871 --> 01:02:41,663
Her videos almost a year old

1232
01:02:41,919 --> 01:02:43,199
From halfway across the country

1233
01:02:43,455 --> 01:02:45,247
Where the problem

1234
01:02:45,503 --> 01:02:46,015
Disgust

1235
01:02:46,527 --> 01:02:49,599
Classic propaganda

1236
01:02:50,623 --> 01:02:51,647
Because I would know that he

1237
01:02:51,903 --> 01:02:54,975
Can't really address the actual complaints it's very serious issues

1238
01:02:55,231 --> 01:02:58,815
You said they're being brought up about ice border patrol about you

1239
01:02:59,071 --> 01:03:01,631
Trumped overtly supporting

1240
01:03:01,887 --> 01:03:02,399
Utilities

1241
01:03:02,655 --> 01:03:03,935
He moved the goalposts

1242
01:03:04,703 --> 01:03:06,751
People are talking about detainee abuse in Camp

1243
01:03:07,519 --> 01:03:09,567
So he provides footage of a discussion of camp

1244
01:03:09,823 --> 01:03:15,967
What two pretended Deb is just overblown virtues

1245
01:03:16,223 --> 01:03:18,527
Signal being out of their minds

1246
01:03:19,551 --> 01:03:22,367
I try to be sensitive about this and I try to avoid

1247
01:03:22,623 --> 01:03:23,647
Comparing things to the Holocaust

1248
01:03:24,159 --> 01:03:27,231
But Alex is literally mimicking Nazi propaganda strategies

1249
01:03:27,743 --> 01:03:30,303
So I really don't know what else I can do in the circle

1250
01:03:31,839 --> 01:03:34,911
Many people forget the during World War II the Nazis were knocked

1251
01:03:35,167 --> 01:03:36,959
Completely open about what they were doing in their camp

1252
01:03:37,727 --> 01:03:38,239
People

1253
01:03:38,495 --> 01:03:40,287
Have this image in their head the

1254
01:03:40,543 --> 01:03:41,311
It wasn't

1255
01:03:41,823 --> 01:03:42,335
Secretive

1256
01:03:42,591 --> 01:03:45,663
Try to cover that up

1257
01:03:45,919 --> 01:03:46,431
Right

1258
01:03:46,687 --> 01:03:49,759
They tried to create a public perception that

1259
01:03:50,015 --> 01:03:51,551
Does bad as everyone

1260
01:03:51,807 --> 01:03:52,575
Stories

1261
01:03:52,831 --> 01:03:54,367
Is that were saying that they were really awful

1262
01:03:54,623 --> 01:03:56,671
We're almost certainly

1263
01:03:57,439 --> 01:03:59,231
From the US Holocaust Memorial Museum

1264
01:03:59,487 --> 01:04:01,535
Positive stories were fabricated

1265
01:04:01,791 --> 01:04:02,815
It is part of you plan to step

1266
01:04:03,583 --> 01:04:07,679
One booklet printed in 1941 glowingly report the in occupied Poland

1267
01:04:07,935 --> 01:04:09,983
German authorities had put Jews to work

1268
01:04:10,495 --> 01:04:11,519
Buildclean Hospital

1269
01:04:11,775 --> 01:04:13,055
Set up soup kitchens

1270
01:04:13,311 --> 01:04:14,591
And provided them with newspaper

1271
01:04:14,847 --> 01:04:15,871
Vocational training

1272
01:04:17,151 --> 01:04:20,223
What are the essential pieces of the Grandeur deception was teresian

1273
01:04:21,503 --> 01:04:23,295
Again from the US Holocaust

1274
01:04:23,551 --> 01:04:24,063
Memorial Museum

1275
01:04:26,111 --> 01:04:28,927
German

1276
01:04:29,183 --> 01:04:30,463
Did the East perform labor

1277
01:04:30,719 --> 01:04:31,999
To be implausible in reference

1278
01:04:32,255 --> 01:04:35,839
Two elderly Jews disabled War veterans and prominent musicians are artists

1279
01:04:36,351 --> 01:04:37,375
The Nazi regime

1280
01:04:37,631 --> 01:04:39,935
Publicized existence of creation

1281
01:04:40,703 --> 01:04:41,727
As a residential

1282
01:04:41,983 --> 01:04:45,311
Where elderly or disabled German and Austrian Jews could retire

1283
01:04:45,567 --> 01:04:46,591
And live out their lives

1284
01:04:48,383 --> 01:04:49,407
Obviously this was bulshit

1285
01:04:50,175 --> 01:04:54,783
It served as little more than a stop along the way before the victims were sent to their ultimate that's

1286
01:04:55,039 --> 01:04:58,367
Summation and as a place where Nazis could use the place to

1287
01:04:58,623 --> 01:04:59,391
To help mold public

1288
01:04:59,647 --> 01:05:01,183
Perception about their activities

1289
01:05:01,951 --> 01:05:04,511
In 1940 for the Red Cross wanted to tour

1290
01:05:05,023 --> 01:05:06,815
But the Nazis knew they couldn't allow that

1291
01:05:08,095 --> 01:05:11,167
No outright to the Red Cross facility

1292
01:05:11,679 --> 01:05:13,983
They decided to allow the Red Cross to torture Asian

1293
01:05:15,007 --> 01:05:16,543
Quote as an elaborate hoax

1294
01:05:16,799 --> 01:05:19,103
The SS authorities accelerated deportation

1295
01:05:19,615 --> 01:05:21,151
From the ghetto shortly before the visit

1296
01:05:21,407 --> 01:05:23,711
An order the remaining prisoners to beautify

1297
01:05:24,735 --> 01:05:26,015
How to plant garden

1298
01:05:26,271 --> 01:05:28,319
Houses and renovate Barrett

1299
01:05:28,831 --> 01:05:30,623
DSS Authority

1300
01:05:30,879 --> 01:05:32,159
Social and cultural event

1301
01:05:32,415 --> 01:05:32,927
For visiting

1302
01:05:35,231 --> 01:05:38,047
I'm not necessarily trying to say that our government is currently produced

1303
01:05:38,303 --> 01:05:41,375
Eurasian staad Style

1304
01:05:42,143 --> 01:05:43,167
I'm saying Alex

1305
01:05:44,447 --> 01:05:49,823
The strategy of neglecting accusations of abuse of people in custody at one place by pointing to the Optics of a

1306
01:05:50,079 --> 01:05:53,151
Completely different place is directly out of the Nazi propaganda

1307
01:05:53,407 --> 01:05:53,919
The Playbook

1308
01:05:54,431 --> 01:05:58,271
The Nazis did such a good job with their propaganda films about duration gstaad

1309
01:05:58,527 --> 01:06:01,343
The reaction many people had was to wonder quote

1310
01:06:01,599 --> 01:06:03,135
Waikato residents appeared to be

1311
01:06:03,391 --> 01:06:06,975
To live it better more luxurious life than many Germans and wartime

1312
01:06:07,743 --> 01:06:09,023
You may have noticed that Alex

1313
01:06:09,791 --> 01:06:10,815
Similar comments

1314
01:06:11,327 --> 01:06:12,095
They're nicer than

1315
01:06:12,607 --> 01:06:13,631
Camp he dropped his daughter off

1316
01:06:15,935 --> 01:06:20,287
I'm infuriated for the children of America who nobody gives a s*** about on the left

1317
01:06:20,799 --> 01:06:25,151
Well they have their fake paid protesters they're pretending the people

1318
01:06:25,407 --> 01:06:26,943
Inside you're going through anything

1319
01:06:27,199 --> 01:06:29,503
And it's nicer than any public school system that I've ever

1320
01:06:29,759 --> 01:06:30,271
Seen in my life

1321
01:06:30,527 --> 01:06:31,039
That's the true

1322
01:06:31,551 --> 01:06:37,695
The policies that I support from the Republican party that have left these children in this horrible

1323
01:06:37,951 --> 01:06:39,999
Situation are what the left is not taken

1324
01:06:40,255 --> 01:06:43,071
Seriously and ignoring whenever they talk about our

1325
01:06:43,327 --> 01:06:45,887
Concentration camps which are also the policies

1326
01:06:46,143 --> 01:06:47,423
Of the party that I f******

1327
01:06:47,679 --> 01:06:48,191
Support

1328
01:06:48,447 --> 01:06:52,287
Now the obvious difference here is that the ice people probably didn't create

1329
01:06:52,543 --> 01:06:54,079
Completely manufactured reality

1330
01:06:54,335 --> 01:06:57,407
Experience

1331
01:06:58,175 --> 01:06:58,687
44

1332
01:06:58,943 --> 01:07:00,735
It might just

1333
01:07:00,991 --> 01:07:03,551
Very well have been as nice and well-run as she says it

1334
01:07:04,319 --> 01:07:05,855
I need the stress in this case it's

1335
01:07:06,111 --> 01:07:10,207
What's about the government creating a false perception that the media

1336
01:07:10,975 --> 01:07:15,327
Why would they bother when people like Alex and Candice are willing to do all that work for them

1337
01:07:15,583 --> 01:07:17,631
And it seems like people don't really care

1338
01:07:18,655 --> 01:07:21,983
Something that made her video at least seven immigrant children have died in US

1339
01:07:23,263 --> 01:07:24,799
I make no mistake about this this isn't

1340
01:07:25,055 --> 01:07:26,591
The problem this is a nice prob

1341
01:07:26,847 --> 01:07:27,615
Any predates

1342
01:07:28,639 --> 01:07:31,967
Obama is definitely to share some blame in the current situation

1343
01:07:32,223 --> 01:07:34,783
But it would be delusional say that the Trump Administration is

1344
01:07:35,551 --> 01:07:36,063
Things much worse

1345
01:07:36,575 --> 01:07:37,599
And allowing conditions

1346
01:07:37,855 --> 01:07:38,367
To worsen

1347
01:07:38,623 --> 01:07:40,159
I want I want

1348
01:07:40,415 --> 01:07:42,719
Just make this clear

1349
01:07:42,975 --> 01:07:44,511
Me to misconstrue the point that I make

1350
01:07:45,279 --> 01:07:47,071
I'm not in any way saying

1351
01:07:47,327 --> 01:07:47,839
The camp

1352
01:07:48,095 --> 01:07:49,887
We are running or on par with

1353
01:07:50,143 --> 01:07:51,679
The camps that were run by the

1354
01:07:52,703 --> 01:07:55,007
I'm not I'm not making any kind of direct

1355
01:07:55,263 --> 01:07:56,031
Comparison Thayer

1356
01:07:56,287 --> 01:07:56,799
I'm talking

1357
01:07:57,055 --> 01:07:58,847
Specifically about this strategy

1358
01:07:59,359 --> 01:08:00,383
Used

1359
01:08:00,639 --> 01:08:01,919
In order to shift public

1360
01:08:02,175 --> 01:08:02,687
Perception

1361
01:08:02,943 --> 01:08:03,967
Of the reality

1362
01:08:04,223 --> 01:08:04,735
Right

1363
01:08:05,247 --> 01:08:06,527
When you have ice

1364
01:08:07,295 --> 01:08:08,063
Border patrol

1365
01:08:08,319 --> 01:08:08,831
Facilities

1366
01:08:09,087 --> 01:08:09,855
That are the subject

1367
01:08:10,111 --> 01:08:10,623
Conversation

1368
01:08:11,135 --> 01:08:11,903
People in Congress

1369
01:08:12,159 --> 01:08:13,951
People who are concerned parties

1370
01:08:14,207 --> 01:08:15,231
Daisy OU

1371
01:08:16,511 --> 01:08:18,047
People who are human rights

1372
01:08:18,815 --> 01:08:20,607
Would you have people having those conversations

1373
01:08:20,863 --> 01:08:21,375
About this

1374
01:08:21,631 --> 01:08:22,143
Specific

1375
01:08:22,655 --> 01:08:23,423
For Alex

1376
01:08:23,935 --> 01:08:24,447
2

1377
01:08:24,959 --> 01:08:25,727
Talk about

1378
01:08:25,983 --> 01:08:27,775
Something else

1379
01:08:28,031 --> 01:08:29,567
Entirely in order to

1380
01:08:29,823 --> 01:08:30,591
Deflect from

1381
01:08:31,871 --> 01:08:33,151
The original issue

1382
01:08:33,663 --> 01:08:34,431
That is

1383
01:08:34,943 --> 01:08:35,455
Specifically

1384
01:08:36,223 --> 01:08:36,991
Monopoly strategy

1385
01:08:37,247 --> 01:08:38,271
Employed

1386
01:08:38,527 --> 01:08:39,039
To trick

1387
01:08:39,295 --> 01:08:40,575
The world's Community into

1388
01:08:41,087 --> 01:08:43,647
Being pacified and not taking the issue seriously

1389
01:08:43,903 --> 01:08:45,183
Which interesting Lee enough

1390
01:08:45,439 --> 01:08:50,303
Sounds very similar to something that was ascribed

1391
01:08:51,327 --> 01:08:52,351
An anti-Semitic

1392
01:08:52,863 --> 01:08:53,375
Propaganda

1393
01:09:01,567 --> 01:09:03,359
Really drive home that he thinks

1394
01:09:04,383 --> 01:09:06,175
He thinks but she just put this video out

1395
01:09:06,943 --> 01:09:08,223
I was coming up today

1396
01:09:08,479 --> 01:09:11,039
Credible

1397
01:09:11,295 --> 01:09:12,831
Powerful

1398
01:09:16,415 --> 01:09:18,463
Procedure for third fourth

1399
01:09:19,487 --> 01:09:20,255
Detention Center

1400
01:09:27,679 --> 01:09:30,239
He's presenting this is a current thing that he doesn't even more

1401
01:09:31,007 --> 01:09:33,311
Someone comes out she's really pissed

1402
01:09:33,823 --> 01:09:35,871
Rabbits facility

1403
01:09:38,687 --> 01:09:40,991
These are like Informer nice hotels and stuff

1404
01:09:42,271 --> 01:09:43,039
We going

1405
01:09:47,903 --> 01:09:49,695
She wants you to go viral

1406
01:09:54,303 --> 01:09:57,375
A few hours

1407
01:09:58,143 --> 01:09:59,679
Hand shooting a

1408
01:10:00,191 --> 01:10:00,959
Well guess what

1409
01:10:01,215 --> 01:10:03,263
I saw the left this morning at 5 a.m.

1410
01:10:05,311 --> 01:10:08,639
Screw you

1411
01:10:08,895 --> 01:10:12,479
She wants to go viral we're going to help

1412
01:10:12,735 --> 01:10:14,527
Because it's put it up a couple hours ago

1413
01:10:15,295 --> 01:10:15,807
F****** b*******

1414
01:10:16,575 --> 01:10:17,855
Alex

1415
01:10:18,111 --> 01:10:19,647
Is very unclear about this

1416
01:10:20,159 --> 01:10:20,927
Still talking about

1417
01:10:21,183 --> 01:10:23,487
Candace Owens and I thought he was talking about her

1418
01:10:23,743 --> 01:10:24,255
Specifically

1419
01:10:24,511 --> 01:10:29,375
He's talking about some other local Fox affiliate reporter

1420
01:10:29,631 --> 01:10:30,911
Who has a social media account

1421
01:10:32,447 --> 01:10:33,471
This thing

1422
01:10:33,727 --> 01:10:34,239
Platform

1423
01:10:34,751 --> 01:10:36,031
It's a sort of relief

1424
01:10:36,287 --> 01:10:37,311
Candace Owens

1425
01:10:38,079 --> 01:10:40,639
We need a little palate cleanser and there's something kind of fun

1426
01:10:47,295 --> 01:10:48,575
Award winner

1427
01:10:48,831 --> 01:10:50,623
A car with a parlor account

1428
01:10:51,135 --> 01:10:53,183
But you just a conservative or open

1429
01:10:53,695 --> 01:10:54,719
Facebook alternative

1430
01:10:54,975 --> 01:10:58,303
You're not supposed to

1431
01:11:01,375 --> 01:11:02,143
So

1432
01:11:02,399 --> 01:11:08,543
This is just another one of these social media upstarts where people have been kicked off Facebook and Twitter have tried to create their own homes

1433
01:11:08,799 --> 01:11:12,383
Open telegram

1434
01:11:15,967 --> 01:11:19,551
Parlay

1435
01:11:19,807 --> 01:11:21,855
Pronounce like the French verb to speak

1436
01:11:23,647 --> 01:11:25,183
I just started calling a parlor

1437
01:11:25,439 --> 01:11:29,279
So the official pronunciation of the Parlor

1438
01:11:29,535 --> 01:11:32,863
But it's spelled parley that's how it.

1439
01:11:33,119 --> 01:11:35,167
Parler is how you spell the French

1440
01:11:36,447 --> 01:11:42,591
Yeah it wasn't it wasn't spelled

1441
01:11:42,847 --> 01:11:44,127
I guess people are just quitting

1442
01:11:44,383 --> 01:11:47,711
Official pronunciation

1443
01:11:47,967 --> 01:11:49,503
Back against the French pronunciation

1444
01:11:50,015 --> 01:11:53,343
Reply poem that's supposed to be about free speech and free expression

1445
01:11:53,599 --> 01:11:59,743
It seems like a profoundly Rocky start for the creator of the site 290 be allowed to call the

1446
01:11:59,999 --> 01:12:01,791
Due to crushing anti-french bias

1447
01:12:02,047 --> 01:12:03,071
On the part of the mob

1448
01:12:03,327 --> 01:12:04,607
Yeah why didn't you just call it

1449
01:12:04,863 --> 01:12:06,399
Freedom page exact

1450
01:12:07,167 --> 01:12:12,799
Since launching a parlor has gotten into a bit of a feud with gab has gotten into a beef

1451
01:12:13,055 --> 01:12:15,103
And most people think that the site kind of sucks

1452
01:12:15,359 --> 01:12:16,127
It's not scaled

1453
01:12:16,383 --> 01:12:17,407
To the amount of users

1454
01:12:17,663 --> 01:12:18,943
So there's often like

1455
01:12:19,199 --> 01:12:20,735
Slow down glitching

1456
01:12:21,247 --> 01:12:22,783
It's our thing it's right.

1457
01:12:23,039 --> 01:12:23,551
Experience

1458
01:12:24,063 --> 01:12:28,671
A June 15th and daily. Point out the Candace Owens herself is only made 13

1459
01:12:28,927 --> 01:12:29,951
Total post on the site

1460
01:12:30,207 --> 01:12:31,487
And hadn't posted anything

1461
01:12:31,743 --> 01:12:32,511
January

1462
01:12:33,023 --> 01:12:33,791
Because why would she

1463
01:12:34,047 --> 01:12:35,071
She's still on Twitter

1464
01:12:35,327 --> 01:12:38,399
Your Griff doesn't really run on diminished levels of attention

1465
01:12:39,167 --> 01:12:40,703
It's good to signal to these alternatives

1466
01:12:40,959 --> 01:12:46,591
Twitter be like yeah we can use the real thing that you're going

1467
01:12:47,103 --> 01:12:49,919
Going to refuse to pronounce the name correctly cuz your name

1468
01:12:50,431 --> 01:12:51,199
Yeah they are

1469
01:12:54,783 --> 01:12:56,063
Swing social media

1470
01:12:56,319 --> 01:12:57,599
Alex makes an announcement

1471
01:12:57,855 --> 01:12:59,391
About video

1472
01:13:00,159 --> 01:13:02,463
So he took the video of Candace Owen

1473
01:13:02,975 --> 01:13:05,535
From a year ago

1474
01:13:06,303 --> 01:13:07,071
Into the video

1475
01:13:07,327 --> 01:13:08,863
Okay

1476
01:13:09,119 --> 01:13:13,471
Pretending the camps are all cool kids

1477
01:13:16,031 --> 01:13:17,823
And look at look what he says about social media

1478
01:13:18,335 --> 01:13:21,407
Powerful migration Detention Center

1479
01:13:28,063 --> 01:13:31,647
You need to get to shout I guess those bands are really working

1480
01:13:32,159 --> 01:13:34,719
Alex's pool Twitter

1481
01:13:34,975 --> 01:13:35,487
Publicly

1482
01:13:35,743 --> 01:13:39,071
No I guess they still have some sort of

1483
01:13:39,327 --> 01:13:41,631
I guess

1484
01:13:41,887 --> 01:13:44,703
That's not good this is why I

1485
01:13:44,959 --> 01:13:48,287
Concerned whatever the social media fan started

1486
01:13:48,799 --> 01:13:49,823
I know that there

1487
01:13:50,335 --> 01:13:55,199
Should had their Bad actors they'll find a way around it

1488
01:13:55,455 --> 01:13:56,735
But they still have

1489
01:13:56,991 --> 01:13:57,759
You just

1490
01:13:58,015 --> 01:13:58,783
You cancer

1491
01:13:59,039 --> 01:14:00,575
There's no real level of

1492
01:14:00,831 --> 01:14:03,391
Control that you can exert that will actually

1493
01:14:04,671 --> 01:14:05,439
Keep people like Alec

1494
01:14:05,695 --> 01:14:06,463
Out

1495
01:14:06,719 --> 01:14:09,279
He'll get in the pool somehow he's going to take a s*** while he's in

1496
01:14:11,071 --> 01:14:13,631
It's just it it's just too much data

1497
01:14:17,471 --> 01:14:17,983
There's no way that you

1498
01:14:19,519 --> 01:14:21,311
So a.m. is next clip

1499
01:14:21,567 --> 01:14:23,871
Make the correction about his coverage of Kansas

1500
01:14:24,639 --> 01:14:28,479
And when I heard this I was certain he's like how I found out that it was from last September

1501
01:14:29,503 --> 01:14:30,015
Correction

1502
01:14:30,527 --> 01:14:36,415
Crashing cuz I videos the morning and I was watching this Candace Owens video like 5 in the morning

1503
01:14:38,975 --> 01:14:41,535
Monkey shooting this video

1504
01:14:44,095 --> 01:14:46,399
Shino the video inside these centers

1505
01:14:47,167 --> 01:14:48,959
Michelle it's super nice

1506
01:14:49,471 --> 01:14:52,799
Did I miss the 2 second Forge is like this is coming out to film crew

1507
01:14:58,175 --> 01:15:03,551
Why does she showing all this

1508
01:15:04,063 --> 01:15:06,111
We all should be angry

1509
01:15:06,367 --> 01:15:06,879
You certainly are

1510
01:15:07,391 --> 01:15:13,023
I can't believe that he thought to make a correction and it wasn't that this is almost a year old video

1511
01:15:13,535 --> 01:15:16,095
Like how it's amazing to me

1512
01:15:16,351 --> 01:15:19,679
No he said that you didn't have a film crew she was doing it by herself

1513
01:15:19,935 --> 01:15:22,495
But you did he didn't see the whole part correct

1514
01:15:22,751 --> 01:15:25,823
Because in the video she mentions her film crew

1515
01:15:26,079 --> 01:15:32,223
September 2018

1516
01:15:32,479 --> 01:15:33,247
About that because it's

1517
01:15:33,503 --> 01:15:35,551
Obviously I'm wrong

1518
01:15:37,855 --> 01:15:39,391
Brings up those out

1519
01:15:39,647 --> 01:15:40,927
Pieces that he added

1520
01:15:41,183 --> 01:15:42,207
To her story

1521
01:15:42,719 --> 01:15:43,743
In order to add proof

1522
01:15:43,999 --> 01:15:45,791
That these places

1523
01:15:46,815 --> 01:15:47,583
Will notice

1524
01:15:47,839 --> 01:15:50,399
Texas and California and Arizona

1525
01:15:51,423 --> 01:15:52,703
Which watching footage

1526
01:15:53,215 --> 01:15:55,007
Released yesterday

1527
01:15:55,775 --> 01:15:57,823
Showing exactly

1528
01:15:58,335 --> 01:16:01,151
She said she found in Florida

1529
01:16:04,735 --> 01:16:05,759
The same

1530
01:16:06,015 --> 01:16:06,783
They're all the same

1531
01:16:08,063 --> 01:16:09,855
Play selected

1532
01:16:10,111 --> 01:16:12,671
Clips from the sap video that was released free

1533
01:16:13,439 --> 01:16:13,951
But he's being

1534
01:16:14,719 --> 01:16:15,231
Dishonored

1535
01:16:16,511 --> 01:16:19,327
This video is about a camp in Carrizo Springs Texas

1536
01:16:19,583 --> 01:16:21,631
Human Services

1537
01:16:22,399 --> 01:16:25,727
Alex play some clips you know where the kids are playing sports

1538
01:16:25,983 --> 01:16:27,007
Reading textbook

1539
01:16:28,799 --> 01:16:30,079
No idea how he

1540
01:16:31,359 --> 01:16:36,991
From the DHHS spokesman Mark Wahlberg the reason for Carrizo Springs

1541
01:16:37,247 --> 01:16:43,391
Sup is not children to stay in border patrol stations any longer than they need

1542
01:16:44,671 --> 01:16:46,719
You probably don't trust me so here he is saying that

1543
01:16:47,231 --> 01:16:53,375
The reason for Carrizo Springs and the reason why we spend this up again not to allow

1544
01:16:53,631 --> 01:16:57,471
Children to stay in Border Patrol Station any longer than they need to

1545
01:16:57,983 --> 01:17:00,031
Oh so let me know

1546
01:17:01,311 --> 01:17:05,151
This AP video is explicitly about a DHHS Center that has been set up

1547
01:17:05,407 --> 01:17:07,455
Because of how on Save ice and Border Patrol

1548
01:17:07,711 --> 01:17:08,223
Factors are

1549
01:17:08,479 --> 01:17:10,527
That's not my interpretation of the video

1550
01:17:10,783 --> 01:17:16,415
Here's another part of this two-and-a-half minutes

1551
01:17:19,999 --> 01:17:21,279
And make this point

1552
01:17:25,631 --> 01:17:27,679
Then various branches of federal

1553
01:17:32,799 --> 01:17:34,591
Patrol

1554
01:17:35,103 --> 01:17:40,223
Across the Rio Grande Valley the Department of Homeland Security's Inspector General

1555
01:17:40,479 --> 01:17:42,015
Had no access to showers

1556
01:17:47,647 --> 01:17:48,671
This video is

1557
01:17:48,927 --> 01:17:49,439
Two-and-a-half

1558
01:17:49,951 --> 01:17:50,463
Minutes long

1559
01:17:51,487 --> 01:17:52,767
You just select

1560
01:17:53,023 --> 01:17:53,791
Actively taking out the

1561
01:17:54,047 --> 01:17:56,095
The parts help him build his

1562
01:17:56,351 --> 01:17:56,863
False mirror

1563
01:17:57,631 --> 01:17:59,167
If you need this to be any BoRics

1564
01:17:59,423 --> 01:18:01,983
Please listen to how this report ends

1565
01:18:02,239 --> 01:18:06,591
Who runs the company that took the contract to run the center

1566
01:18:06,847 --> 01:18:10,431
Explicitly under the condition that the government allow the children quote

1567
01:18:10,687 --> 01:18:14,271
Unfettered access to human rights lawyers lawmakers and the media

1568
01:18:14,783 --> 01:18:17,599
And every response that we've done for Orr

1569
01:18:18,111 --> 01:18:19,135
It's been to keep

1570
01:18:19,391 --> 01:18:21,439
Kids out of CBP jail

1571
01:18:22,463 --> 01:18:27,327
So let me be clear I'm not saying that this DHHS facility is a good thing and I still think

1572
01:18:27,583 --> 01:18:29,119
Constituted an appropriate attention

1573
01:18:29,375 --> 01:18:30,399
But it's a completely different

1574
01:18:35,007 --> 01:18:36,287
And in fact in that clip

1575
01:18:36,799 --> 01:18:41,407
It's very clear that the people who are running it specifically

1576
01:18:41,663 --> 01:18:44,479
Of the very unsafe things that are the things that they do

1577
01:18:44,735 --> 01:18:46,015
See you talkin about it complaining about

1578
01:18:46,783 --> 01:18:48,063
So if you're keeping score

1579
01:18:48,831 --> 01:18:51,903
Alex Jones has made an emergency video that has to go viral

1580
01:18:52,159 --> 01:18:52,671
Biking

1581
01:18:52,927 --> 01:18:53,951
Vining an almost

1582
01:18:54,207 --> 01:18:54,975
Dear old ring

1583
01:18:55,231 --> 01:18:57,791
From Candace Owens is Crypt we Florida detention

1584
01:18:58,047 --> 01:19:04,191
Concentra

1585
01:19:04,447 --> 01:19:06,495
Keep children out of ice and border patrol centers

1586
01:19:06,751 --> 01:19:08,543
Were they often don't have access to shower

1587
01:19:09,055 --> 01:19:10,079
Alex is presenting

1588
01:19:10,335 --> 01:19:10,847
These two things

1589
01:19:11,103 --> 01:19:12,383
It's some kind of a debunked

1590
01:19:12,639 --> 01:19:15,967
Atrocities that are being reported out of my

1591
01:19:16,223 --> 01:19:18,015
Wichita you all you need to know

1592
01:19:18,527 --> 01:19:19,807
He doesn't give a f*** about what's real

1593
01:19:20,319 --> 01:19:21,599
He doesn't give a f*** about those kids

1594
01:19:22,111 --> 01:19:24,159
He doesn't give a f*** about the truth

1595
01:19:24,415 --> 01:19:25,439
A f*** about doing a good job

1596
01:19:26,207 --> 01:19:28,255
If you're trying to do a good job as a journalist

1597
01:19:28,767 --> 01:19:29,279
He's failed miserably

1598
01:19:30,047 --> 01:19:31,327
But it's important to remember

1599
01:19:31,583 --> 01:19:33,887
He's not trying to be a journalist or even a pundit

1600
01:19:34,399 --> 01:19:35,167
Consider this

1601
01:19:35,679 --> 01:19:39,775
If you were trying to do a good job of creating the image of a modern duration

1602
01:19:40,031 --> 01:19:45,151
Can start for his followers to accept the reality

1603
01:19:47,967 --> 01:19:50,015
Understand how people like him

1604
01:19:51,551 --> 01:19:52,063
Like

1605
01:19:52,319 --> 01:19:56,927
So these guys now are all running

1606
01:19:57,695 --> 01:19:58,719
Just so they can

1607
01:19:58,975 --> 01:19:59,999
Allow children to

1608
01:20:00,767 --> 01:20:01,791
And people to be kept

1609
01:20:02,047 --> 01:20:02,559
Did the Border

1610
01:20:02,815 --> 01:20:05,119
In order to try and discourage other people from

1611
01:20:05,631 --> 01:20:06,399
And also just

1612
01:20:06,655 --> 01:20:07,679
To be cruel because they

1613
01:20:08,191 --> 01:20:09,471
And so they're creating

1614
01:20:09,727 --> 01:20:11,007
Because they know

1615
01:20:11,519 --> 01:20:12,543
That a lot of the

1616
01:20:12,799 --> 01:20:17,152
People who support them a lot of people who are necessary for the gp2 remaining

1617
01:20:17,408 --> 01:20:17,920
Empower

1618
01:20:18,688 --> 01:20:19,200
Wouldn't

1619
01:20:19,456 --> 01:20:21,504
Fans of murder

1620
01:20:22,272 --> 01:20:23,296
So they're lying to them

1621
01:20:23,808 --> 01:20:25,344
Their own

1622
01:20:25,856 --> 01:20:27,136
Their own people would suggest

1623
01:20:27,392 --> 01:20:28,416
They know how

1624
01:20:28,672 --> 01:20:29,952
Evil it is what they're doing

1625
01:20:30,976 --> 01:20:33,280
You know and it's a lie

1626
01:20:33,536 --> 01:20:34,048
I just don't

1627
01:20:34,304 --> 01:20:39,424
I mean they know they don't just know they're lying they know they're lying in service of

1628
01:20:39,936 --> 01:20:40,960
Cruelty and murder

1629
01:20:42,496 --> 01:20:44,800
So that's what I want

1630
01:20:46,848 --> 01:20:51,968
I know I'm nice I'm constantly struggling

1631
01:20:52,224 --> 01:20:53,504
With that experience it fresh

1632
01:20:54,016 --> 01:20:56,064
Whenever you

1633
01:20:56,320 --> 01:20:57,088
Care

1634
01:20:57,856 --> 01:21:00,160
It's tough I don't know I mean whatever you lying

1635
01:21:00,416 --> 01:21:01,696
Finally you're doing it for a reason

1636
01:21:03,232 --> 01:21:04,000
You're aware of that

1637
01:21:05,024 --> 01:21:07,840
They don't I don't see anyway Alex to do this just

1638
01:21:08,608 --> 01:21:10,400
Coincidence

1639
01:21:12,704 --> 01:21:16,032
No this is specific and Direct in on purpose Alex

1640
01:21:16,288 --> 01:21:18,080
Or whoever who works for him

1641
01:21:18,592 --> 01:21:19,872
Took the time to watch this

1642
01:21:20,128 --> 01:21:21,152
Is Two and a Half Men at 8

1643
01:21:21,408 --> 01:21:21,920
Pipi's

1644
01:21:22,176 --> 01:21:23,968
To take the clips of it that they do

1645
01:21:24,224 --> 01:21:27,296
They would have had to see the other things that directly contradict

1646
01:21:27,552 --> 01:21:29,856
The ways in which sport

1647
01:21:30,112 --> 01:21:31,904
The only reason you would do that

1648
01:21:32,416 --> 01:21:33,952
Is an order to create a false

1649
01:21:34,464 --> 01:21:35,488
Appearance

1650
01:21:35,744 --> 01:21:36,768
About what

1651
01:21:37,536 --> 01:21:39,328
December's really are

1652
01:21:39,840 --> 01:21:40,608
And the only reason

1653
01:21:40,864 --> 01:21:41,376
Would do that

1654
01:21:41,632 --> 01:21:43,936
It's because you're aware that they're really bad

1655
01:21:44,192 --> 01:21:46,752
And if the appearance of them being really bad is allowed to

1656
01:21:47,008 --> 01:21:47,520
Stand up

1657
01:21:47,776 --> 01:21:48,288
Republic

1658
01:21:48,544 --> 01:21:49,824
It's going a road

1659
01:21:50,080 --> 01:21:50,592
Whatever

1660
01:21:51,104 --> 01:21:54,944
State of the market you have whatever political power you have now with Trump

1661
01:21:55,200 --> 01:21:55,712
Send it

1662
01:21:56,224 --> 01:21:59,552
It's very clear like it unravels very quickly and

1663
01:21:59,808 --> 01:22:00,320
When you take

1664
01:22:01,088 --> 01:22:01,600
Will you take it

1665
01:22:02,112 --> 01:22:02,880
The second 2

1666
01:22:03,136 --> 01:22:03,904
Understand

1667
01:22:04,160 --> 01:22:06,208
This is a strategy

1668
01:22:09,280 --> 01:22:10,048
This isn't okay

1669
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:12,864
Exist on the same program where Within

1670
01:22:13,120 --> 01:22:14,144
A day of this

1671
01:22:14,400 --> 01:22:16,192
You have a guy who admires

1672
01:22:16,448 --> 01:22:17,984
Anders Breivik coming on the show

1673
01:22:18,240 --> 01:22:20,800
To save it some American or some citizens aren't American

1674
01:22:23,104 --> 01:22:24,640
Work it like this is here

1675
01:22:25,920 --> 01:22:26,432
Is

1676
01:22:26,688 --> 01:22:28,224
They're not f****** around

1677
01:22:28,736 --> 01:22:31,040
Whenever I worried that Alex would take

1678
01:22:31,296 --> 01:22:32,064
The

1679
01:22:32,576 --> 01:22:33,088
The band

1680
01:22:33,344 --> 01:22:34,112
Social media

1681
01:22:36,160 --> 01:22:36,672
Dream about it

1682
01:22:36,928 --> 01:22:38,464
What is things that I was

1683
01:22:39,232 --> 01:22:40,256
Looking at was like

1684
01:22:40,512 --> 01:22:43,072
You might just start end up saying the n-word and

1685
01:22:43,328 --> 01:22:44,864
Like really good old fart with it

1686
01:22:45,120 --> 01:22:48,960
You know what guys I've been around for a long time

1687
01:22:49,216 --> 01:22:50,752
Or something like that

1688
01:22:51,008 --> 01:22:54,336
It Was Naive of me possibly to expect

1689
01:22:54,592 --> 01:22:55,360
That kind of

1690
01:22:59,968 --> 01:23:00,480
Is

1691
01:23:00,736 --> 01:23:03,552
This is exactly that but slightly different version of it

1692
01:23:03,808 --> 01:23:04,576
Then I expected

1693
01:23:04,832 --> 01:23:07,136
To find this show is inexcusable

1694
01:23:07,392 --> 01:23:07,904
And its presence

1695
01:23:08,672 --> 01:23:09,952
Anybody who works there should be

1696
01:23:10,208 --> 01:23:10,720
Deeply f******

1697
01:23:10,976 --> 01:23:11,744
Themselves

1698
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:13,536
They have to be aware of what they're doing

1699
01:23:15,072 --> 01:23:17,120
To get this out this out of our mouths

1700
01:23:18,144 --> 01:23:18,912
Stout

1701
01:23:19,424 --> 01:23:20,448
Alex's new shirt

1702
01:23:23,520 --> 01:23:26,080
I swear to God

1703
01:23:26,336 --> 01:23:28,384
I swear to God a bird of this place outfits

1704
01:23:28,640 --> 01:23:29,920
Okay

1705
01:23:30,176 --> 01:23:32,736
Recently Alex put out a Betsy Ross

1706
01:23:34,528 --> 01:23:35,808
Just caught these colors don't run

1707
01:23:36,064 --> 01:23:37,856
I'm kind of

1708
01:23:38,112 --> 01:23:43,488
They owned so hard we just got still burn a little bit

1709
01:23:48,096 --> 01:23:49,888
Shirt

1710
01:23:50,912 --> 01:23:51,936
There we go

1711
01:23:52,192 --> 01:23:52,960
In this clip

1712
01:23:53,728 --> 01:23:56,800
Alex is simultaneously saying that he stole this shirt

1713
01:23:57,056 --> 01:23:57,568
From somebody

1714
01:23:58,592 --> 01:23:59,872
But he came up with it himself

1715
01:24:00,384 --> 01:24:00,896
What

1716
01:24:01,408 --> 01:24:03,712
I said work just fell out of the

1717
01:24:04,224 --> 01:24:05,248
Betsy Ross

1718
01:24:05,504 --> 01:24:10,112
American flag shirt

1719
01:24:11,648 --> 01:24:15,744
4000

1720
01:24:19,328 --> 01:24:21,888
I said I want to be an American flag

1721
01:24:23,168 --> 01:24:26,752
Classic American

1722
01:24:28,032 --> 01:24:31,360
With katzenstein superimposed

1723
01:24:36,224 --> 01:24:38,016
America's back infowars.com

1724
01:24:42,368 --> 01:24:43,904
Infowars.com

1725
01:24:45,440 --> 01:24:46,464
Chris Pratt

1726
01:24:47,488 --> 01:24:49,280
Criticized for t-shirt choice

1727
01:24:51,328 --> 01:24:56,960
Which

1728
01:24:59,776 --> 01:25:00,544
Don't tread on me

1729
01:25:00,800 --> 01:25:01,568
Under the black

1730
01:25:06,944 --> 01:25:09,760
We'd already come

1731
01:25:11,552 --> 01:25:17,696
By the way

1732
01:25:17,952 --> 01:25:19,744
Iraq flag

1733
01:25:21,792 --> 01:25:23,584
311

1734
01:25:24,096 --> 01:25:27,680
American flag

1735
01:25:28,704 --> 01:25:30,752
Inspired by the triggering of leftists

1736
01:25:31,008 --> 01:25:32,288
The shirt worn by

1737
01:25:32,544 --> 01:25:33,312
Chris Pratt

1738
01:25:33,568 --> 01:25:39,712
Is it inspired by the left getting mad Chris Pratt's shirt or did you come up with it mysteriously before

1739
01:25:40,992 --> 01:25:43,040
It happens to be the exact same shirt

1740
01:25:43,296 --> 01:25:45,344
Which is it because Alex

1741
01:25:45,600 --> 01:25:48,416
From your own words you have a habit of stealing things

1742
01:25:48,672 --> 01:25:52,000
From people

1743
01:25:56,864 --> 01:26:00,192
You stole Hillary for Prison from a bumper sticker you saw

1744
01:26:00,448 --> 01:26:03,264
You have a habit of stealing people's intellectual property

1745
01:26:03,520 --> 01:26:04,800
Whatever I hear you say like

1746
01:26:05,056 --> 01:26:07,616
Oh yeah I read this article about how crisp

1747
01:26:07,872 --> 01:26:12,224
Everyone's mad at his shirt with the snake on it with the American flag

1748
01:26:12,480 --> 01:26:17,600
I know I've already come up with that yeah we're going to sell this inspired by the left getting there

1749
01:26:17,856 --> 01:26:19,392
I hear that and I think

1750
01:26:19,904 --> 01:26:20,928
You stole this shirt

1751
01:26:21,696 --> 01:26:23,232
Did you create the fake backstory

1752
01:26:25,280 --> 01:26:29,376
Anyone already exist

1753
01:26:29,632 --> 01:26:32,192
You can't just then make the same shirt

1754
01:26:34,496 --> 01:26:35,520
Still not okay

1755
01:26:35,776 --> 01:26:39,360
There's still you yeah

1756
01:26:41,152 --> 01:26:47,296
Ibuprofen is really long novel about about this whale

1757
01:26:47,552 --> 01:26:53,184
And then the other day I was just reading these books and I saw that somebody wrote a review of Moby Dick

1758
01:26:53,440 --> 01:26:57,536
That is a really good idea and so I'm selling my new novel Moby Dick

1759
01:26:58,048 --> 01:26:58,560
If you would like it

1760
01:26:59,328 --> 01:27:02,400
Inspired

1761
01:27:08,288 --> 01:27:11,360
4000 of those

1762
01:27:11,616 --> 01:27:14,688
Has Chris Pratt

1763
01:27:15,200 --> 01:27:18,016
Please feel free to send them this clip and Sue Alex

1764
01:27:19,296 --> 01:27:23,904
On the fence

1765
01:27:24,160 --> 01:27:28,256
In property law

1766
01:27:29,280 --> 01:27:30,048
So

1767
01:27:30,304 --> 01:27:32,096
Not too far back we heard a clip of Alex

1768
01:27:32,608 --> 01:27:34,912
Alleging that the Nazis at Charlotte

1769
01:27:35,168 --> 01:27:36,960
The white nationalist

1770
01:27:37,216 --> 01:27:39,008
We're all gay

1771
01:27:39,776 --> 01:27:40,800
Who had been employed

1772
01:27:41,056 --> 01:27:43,872
Find

1773
01:27:44,128 --> 01:27:47,968
Narrative went by the wayside

1774
01:27:48,480 --> 01:27:50,016
Alex is back on his phone

1775
01:27:51,552 --> 01:27:52,320
This includes

1776
01:27:53,600 --> 01:27:54,112
About Richards

1777
01:27:55,136 --> 01:27:57,952
Did you know that in Charlottesville

1778
01:27:58,464 --> 01:28:01,792
The Democratic party and other groups put out ads

1779
01:28:02,304 --> 01:28:04,352
What is Colton Washington

1780
01:28:12,288 --> 01:28:13,312
Nazis

1781
01:28:17,152 --> 01:28:19,456
Khaki pants white button-up shirt

1782
01:28:19,968 --> 01:28:20,992
Tiki torches

1783
01:28:25,600 --> 01:28:28,160
Democratic Party

1784
01:28:28,416 --> 01:28:30,464
Within two years of the becoming

1785
01:28:30,720 --> 01:28:31,488
Nazi

1786
01:28:35,584 --> 01:28:40,960
And most of them were simply art Department degrees

1787
01:28:44,544 --> 01:28:45,824
I mainly game in

1788
01:28:54,272 --> 01:28:59,904
And then I had there

1789
01:29:02,208 --> 01:29:03,488
America

1790
01:29:04,512 --> 01:29:05,280
Richard Spencer

1791
01:29:08,864 --> 01:29:09,888
Is a total fake

1792
01:29:11,424 --> 01:29:14,496
The Nazi leader

1793
01:29:16,032 --> 01:29:19,104
Where's outfits biking from 1938 Germany

1794
01:29:20,640 --> 01:29:21,152
A giant

1795
01:29:21,408 --> 01:29:21,920
Cedar

1796
01:29:22,176 --> 01:29:24,480
I have the ads

1797
01:29:25,760 --> 01:29:29,344
Recruited Charlottesville activist for $25 an hour

1798
01:29:29,856 --> 01:29:31,904
If you were like someone who admire the knots

1799
01:29:33,440 --> 01:29:33,952
Germany 19

1800
01:29:34,208 --> 01:29:34,720
38

1801
01:29:34,976 --> 01:29:37,536
Seems like that

1802
01:29:39,584 --> 01:29:45,728
So we've heard Alex go down this road before making a bunch of bulshit up but have a good night the right rally in Charlottesville is full of actors

1803
01:29:46,496 --> 01:29:47,776
It's one of his many attempts

1804
01:29:48,032 --> 01:29:48,544
Make sure is

1805
01:29:48,800 --> 01:29:53,664
Doesn't think there were real white supremacist real white nationalist

1806
01:29:54,176 --> 01:29:55,712
For some mysterious reason

1807
01:29:56,224 --> 01:29:57,248
Incredibly threatening

1808
01:29:59,040 --> 01:29:59,552
The same thing with the

1809
01:30:00,320 --> 01:30:04,672
But you can't allow the image of reality to penetrate because if you do

1810
01:30:05,696 --> 01:30:11,584
Run the risk of your audience being like yeah I don't like coming is a m but they're f****** Nazis out there

1811
01:30:12,096 --> 01:30:14,912
We still don't like Nazis

1812
01:30:15,168 --> 01:30:16,704
Azerbaijan

1813
01:30:23,616 --> 01:30:26,432
Also like

1814
01:30:26,688 --> 01:30:29,504
He knows enough to know that there is it

1815
01:30:30,016 --> 01:30:31,552
Considerable faction

1816
01:30:33,088 --> 01:30:35,136
Did were they to think that they were

1817
01:30:35,392 --> 01:30:36,416
In League with

1818
01:30:36,672 --> 01:30:37,184
Supporting

1819
01:30:37,440 --> 01:30:41,280
Legitimate white supremacist right they would not be on board with

1820
01:30:41,536 --> 01:30:43,840
It would be a much tougher sell for him

1821
01:30:44,096 --> 01:30:44,608
Giselle Vasquez

1822
01:30:44,864 --> 01:30:48,960
Austin flag shirt to people who were aware that he's holding water for

1823
01:30:49,216 --> 01:30:49,984
Defending

1824
01:30:50,240 --> 01:30:51,008
Like Lizzy

1825
01:30:51,264 --> 01:30:52,032
Jet racing

1826
01:30:52,288 --> 01:30:56,384
Right I think I wouldn't be surprised

1827
01:30:56,640 --> 01:30:57,408
Treating this like white

1828
01:30:57,664 --> 01:30:58,432
Supremacist p***

1829
01:30:58,688 --> 01:30:59,200
You know like

1830
01:30:59,456 --> 01:31:03,296
They're getting off on this but they would not actually want a white

1831
01:31:03,552 --> 01:31:04,064
Supremacist

1832
01:31:04,832 --> 01:31:06,624
I don't know

1833
01:31:07,392 --> 01:31:09,952
There are a number of people who have

1834
01:31:12,256 --> 01:31:13,280
To think

1835
01:31:13,536 --> 01:31:14,048
Isn't

1836
01:31:14,304 --> 01:31:14,816
Supporting

1837
01:31:15,840 --> 01:31:16,608
I know racism

1838
01:31:17,376 --> 01:31:17,888
Supremacy

1839
01:31:18,656 --> 01:31:19,168
Aspiring.

1840
01:31:19,936 --> 01:31:21,728
And were they to realize that

1841
01:31:21,984 --> 01:31:22,752
It would threaten

1842
01:31:23,264 --> 01:31:24,288
Their contribution

1843
01:31:24,544 --> 01:31:25,312
Into his Marketplace

1844
01:31:25,824 --> 01:31:26,848
I think he knows that

1845
01:31:27,616 --> 01:31:28,640
He knows better

1846
01:31:28,896 --> 01:31:30,944
To allow that perception

1847
01:31:31,200 --> 01:31:34,272
Which is pretty accurate that's almost

1848
01:31:34,528 --> 01:31:37,600
So in order to

1849
01:31:37,856 --> 01:31:38,368
To get around

1850
01:31:38,624 --> 01:31:43,744
Like he had Jason counselor the rally organizer on his show and directly accused

1851
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:49,632
Fake documents contract

1852
01:31:49,888 --> 01:31:52,448
Which put into writing their plans to start race riots

1853
01:31:52,704 --> 01:31:53,472
Which connects

1854
01:31:55,008 --> 01:31:55,520
And of course

1855
01:31:55,776 --> 01:31:58,592
He has the argument that the Nazis really just Casey tour students

1856
01:31:59,616 --> 01:32:01,920
How come you just dismiss this is stupid bullshitted

1857
01:32:04,480 --> 01:32:06,784
The Democrats used to recruit these ha so I thought

1858
01:32:07,040 --> 01:32:10,112
I wouldn't be doing my job if I didn't at least review his evidence

1859
01:32:10,624 --> 01:32:11,904
And man am I glad I did

1860
01:32:13,184 --> 01:32:14,720
2nd August 2017

1861
01:32:14,976 --> 01:32:16,000
Began reporting on the ACT

1862
01:32:16,256 --> 01:32:17,280
Has been used in Charlottesville

1863
01:32:19,840 --> 01:32:20,864
Specific CEUs is here

1864
01:32:21,120 --> 01:32:22,400
On his July 7th

1865
01:32:23,424 --> 01:32:25,984
Episode down to the $25 an hour figure

1866
01:32:26,496 --> 01:32:29,056
His reported was based on a post on zerohedge

1867
01:32:30,336 --> 01:32:30,848
Problems

1868
01:32:31,104 --> 01:32:31,616
The jump out of me

1869
01:32:32,640 --> 01:32:35,200
The first of this is based on a Craigslist ad

1870
01:32:37,504 --> 01:32:38,784
Just about anything on Craigslist

1871
01:32:39,040 --> 01:32:40,064
My job to an apartment

1872
01:32:40,320 --> 01:32:43,392
Knows that it's easy for people to make fake ads on there

1873
01:32:43,904 --> 01:32:49,792
How would you do that I first moved to the city and was looking for work I sent out hundreds of emails Craig

1874
01:32:50,048 --> 01:32:50,560
Posting

1875
01:32:50,816 --> 01:32:53,120
And looking back I'm not sure any of them were real

1876
01:32:53,632 --> 01:32:54,400
If you're going to

1877
01:32:54,656 --> 01:32:55,936
Make the Nazis are a

1878
01:32:56,192 --> 01:32:58,496
Actors argument stronger

1879
01:33:05,152 --> 01:33:07,200
Obviously when he saw this ad he

1880
01:33:07,456 --> 01:33:08,224
We traced it back to

1881
01:33:08,480 --> 01:33:10,272
Did the Democratic Party

1882
01:33:10,528 --> 01:33:11,040
Skills

1883
01:33:11,808 --> 01:33:14,112
Now the bigger problem could be founded Vista

1884
01:33:14,368 --> 01:33:15,392
What is riposte

1885
01:33:15,648 --> 01:33:16,416
Is on Infowars

1886
01:33:17,696 --> 01:33:18,464
Website they copied

1887
01:33:19,232 --> 01:33:19,744
From

1888
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:20,512
Zerohedge

1889
01:33:23,072 --> 01:33:23,840
This detail

1890
01:33:24,352 --> 01:33:26,912
I have no idea how to slip past both

1891
01:33:27,168 --> 01:33:28,448
The crack editorial Department

1892
01:33:28,704 --> 01:33:29,216
Zerohedge

1893
01:33:30,496 --> 01:33:31,520
But some Highway

1894
01:33:33,056 --> 01:33:38,688
The ad was posted by a company called crowds on demand an offer $25 per hour

1895
01:33:38,944 --> 01:33:41,760
To participate in events in the Charlotte North Carolina area

1896
01:33:42,528 --> 01:33:47,392
I'll be the first to admit that Charlottesville is in the Charlotte area in terms of name similarity

1897
01:33:47,648 --> 01:33:48,928
Geography

1898
01:33:49,184 --> 01:33:49,952
They are not close

1899
01:33:50,976 --> 01:33:51,488
Do not

1900
01:33:51,744 --> 01:33:57,888
Miles apart

1901
01:33:58,144 --> 01:34:03,776
That's a four-and-a-half hour drive

1902
01:34:07,872 --> 01:34:11,712
The release for ACT articles about this conspiracy on Infowars website

1903
01:34:11,968 --> 01:34:16,064
Most of them are just embedded videos that are gone now since their YouTube channel is gone

1904
01:34:16,320 --> 01:34:17,856
Try to guess that they are correct

1905
01:34:18,368 --> 01:34:19,904
Headlines like

1906
01:34:20,160 --> 01:34:24,256
Breathtaking actors prior to Charlottesville rally

1907
01:34:25,024 --> 01:34:30,144
No one caught that Charlotte in Charlottesville are not the same city because they don't care

1908
01:34:30,400 --> 01:34:32,192
They know they're lying to begin with

1909
01:34:32,448 --> 01:34:35,008
So it doesn't matter if they're being accurate about their life

1910
01:34:35,776 --> 01:34:37,312
The job is to create a narrative

1911
01:34:37,568 --> 01:34:41,408
To create an excuse for the Nazis violence that is deeply traumatized

1912
01:34:41,920 --> 01:34:42,944
It's easy to look at it

1913
01:34:43,200 --> 01:34:43,712
Buck up like this

1914
01:34:43,968 --> 01:34:45,760
And laugh and save these guys are

1915
01:34:46,016 --> 01:34:47,296
But it's not being dumb

1916
01:34:47,808 --> 01:34:48,832
What do you see something like this

1917
01:34:50,880 --> 01:34:54,976
Defies credulity to imagine multiple people looked at it and didn't say

1918
01:34:55,232 --> 01:34:56,512
Hold on that's a city in a different

1919
01:34:58,048 --> 01:34:59,072
That's a fingerprinted

1920
01:35:01,632 --> 01:35:02,656
List of credible reason

1921
01:35:02,912 --> 01:35:04,192
Sounds like someone might behave

1922
01:35:04,448 --> 01:35:05,216
This way is a pretty f******

1923
01:35:08,032 --> 01:35:08,800
It's not even

1924
01:35:12,128 --> 01:35:13,408
Creating this horrified

1925
01:35:13,664 --> 01:35:14,432
False narrative

1926
01:35:14,688 --> 01:35:17,760
Are there any kind of even if just anything could have made their own

1927
01:35:18,784 --> 01:35:20,576
Scribbled out the date

1928
01:35:20,832 --> 01:35:26,464
It is lazy on on that front I see what it is

1929
01:35:26,720 --> 01:35:27,232
Is a finger

1930
01:35:28,512 --> 01:35:32,864
The fact that someone would accept this level of leak b*******

1931
01:35:33,120 --> 01:35:36,192
In order to perpetuate their idea that these Nazis were

1932
01:35:37,728 --> 01:35:39,520
It means that you were defending Nazis

1933
01:35:40,544 --> 01:35:41,056
Absolutely

1934
01:35:42,336 --> 01:35:45,408
The Republican party is defective

1935
01:35:45,664 --> 01:35:46,688
Cuz you like nuts

1936
01:35:48,224 --> 01:35:51,296
Physics web Alex gets another guest on the show

1937
01:35:54,112 --> 01:35:54,624
Episode

1938
01:35:55,136 --> 01:36:01,280
Gentleman's chest

1939
01:36:07,424 --> 01:36:12,544
Would you believe that there is news that Alex haven't gotten to yet an hour on this f****** dumbass

1940
01:36:12,800 --> 01:36:15,616
Candace Owens video from almost a year ago

1941
01:36:15,872 --> 01:36:16,896
Somehow didn't manage

1942
01:36:17,152 --> 01:36:17,664
Cover news

1943
01:36:17,920 --> 01:36:18,688
I'm confused

1944
01:36:18,944 --> 01:36:20,224
He still doing is he still

1945
01:36:20,480 --> 01:36:22,784
I'm fixing to eat

1946
01:36:31,488 --> 01:36:33,536
You video that he's lying about his recent

1947
01:36:35,584 --> 01:36:37,120
Lying about it

1948
01:36:37,376 --> 01:36:40,704
All right kind of news

1949
01:36:40,960 --> 01:36:45,312
Ben Garrison and have a conversation about Trump

1950
01:36:45,568 --> 01:36:47,360
And how about those that work

1951
01:36:47,616 --> 01:36:48,128
That's fine

1952
01:36:54,784 --> 01:37:00,928
Still got to go do whatever these two.

1953
01:37:01,184 --> 01:37:02,208
Just imported attention-grabbing

1954
01:37:02,464 --> 01:37:08,608
There's an article that I scrolled passed on Infowars

1955
01:37:09,888 --> 01:37:12,192
I was like God dude is hilarious

1956
01:37:12,448 --> 01:37:16,032
You know what I didn't know that I needed that

1957
01:37:16,800 --> 01:37:17,312
In my life by

1958
01:37:17,568 --> 01:37:19,360
Restaurant

1959
01:37:19,616 --> 01:37:23,456
Think it might be fake B whatever push

1960
01:37:23,712 --> 01:37:25,760
It's one of the great things about not caring

1961
01:37:26,016 --> 01:37:26,784
About

1962
01:37:27,040 --> 01:37:32,160
Be specific tentacles of Alex's world is

1963
01:37:34,208 --> 01:37:39,840
Jersey

1964
01:37:41,888 --> 01:37:43,424
I don't give a f*** about Ben Garrison

1965
01:37:44,448 --> 01:37:45,984
I don't really care about his

1966
01:37:46,240 --> 01:37:47,008
Perspective on

1967
01:37:47,520 --> 01:37:48,032
Stop

1968
01:37:48,544 --> 01:37:50,592
I'll really

1969
01:37:52,896 --> 01:37:53,920
But in this

1970
01:37:54,432 --> 01:37:56,224
Interview he says a couple things

1971
01:37:56,480 --> 01:37:57,760
That I think are really

1972
01:37:58,016 --> 01:37:58,528
Interest

1973
01:37:59,296 --> 01:38:00,320
Evan this first one

1974
01:38:00,576 --> 01:38:03,392
I think he accidentally makes a case for a

1975
01:38:04,928 --> 01:38:09,280
Washington d.c. it was too late to cancel the tickets I said heck with it I'll go and

1976
01:38:10,048 --> 01:38:15,168
And one of the invitees so I was kind enough to invite me to the

1977
01:38:15,680 --> 01:38:19,520
After party at the Trump International Hotel where I stayed and it was a

1978
01:38:19,776 --> 01:38:23,616
The really nice experience and let me tell you Alex about I mean I saw

1979
01:38:24,128 --> 01:38:26,432
I thought you were going to Harrison Smith there

1980
01:38:26,944 --> 01:38:33,088
So they have some at the social media Summit he's people were staying at Trump's hotel when they

1981
01:38:33,344 --> 01:38:36,416
Came in and they had their official after-party at Trump's hotel

1982
01:38:37,184 --> 01:38:39,232
This is a pretty clear-cut case

1983
01:38:39,744 --> 01:38:42,304
Emoluments Clause action

1984
01:38:43,072 --> 01:38:43,584
What

1985
01:38:44,096 --> 01:38:50,240
How are those lawsuits

1986
01:38:50,496 --> 01:38:51,520
No he's break break

1987
01:38:53,568 --> 01:38:56,896
And yet all of these lawsuits

1988
01:39:00,224 --> 01:39:03,296
I don't know I don't I haven't kept

1989
01:39:03,552 --> 01:39:05,088
I haven't kept track of a lot of those.

1990
01:39:05,344 --> 01:39:11,488
Details but like people coming on Alex's show an indicator

1991
01:39:11,744 --> 01:39:12,256
Trump is prophet

1992
01:39:12,512 --> 01:39:13,792
From the president

1993
01:39:14,048 --> 01:39:16,864
And I just don't understand how like it can be soaked

1994
01:39:17,120 --> 01:39:17,888
Casual and

1995
01:39:18,144 --> 01:39:18,656
Not they don't

1996
01:39:18,912 --> 01:39:19,936
Care I just I don't

1997
01:39:20,192 --> 01:39:20,960
I do

1998
01:39:22,752 --> 01:39:25,568
I don't understand how come no court has yet has been like

1999
01:39:25,824 --> 01:39:29,920
Because they don't

2000
01:39:30,176 --> 01:39:36,320
They were found not to have to go through

2001
01:39:36,576 --> 01:39:37,088
Because it.

2002
01:39:41,184 --> 01:39:44,000
Real it's so f****** unreal

2003
01:39:44,768 --> 01:39:47,072
How is it that what is even the goddamn

2004
01:39:49,632 --> 01:39:52,448
Tution

2005
01:39:52,960 --> 01:39:56,288
Love it so goddamn much ignore the entirety of it

2006
01:39:56,800 --> 01:40:00,640
Tell me it's crazy in between that and like all this other all this other s***

2007
01:40:02,688 --> 01:40:03,968
I guess impeachment never

2008
01:40:04,224 --> 01:40:05,248
Was meant to be a thing

2009
01:40:16,000 --> 01:40:17,536
Why would anybody

2010
01:40:18,048 --> 01:40:21,120
Republican

2011
01:40:21,376 --> 01:40:22,912
Seriously the threat

2012
01:40:29,568 --> 01:40:31,104
To say anything other than

2013
01:40:31,616 --> 01:40:33,152
The Democrat Party

2014
01:40:33,408 --> 01:40:34,176
Is

2015
01:40:34,432 --> 01:40:35,712
Week on this sort of thing

2016
01:40:35,968 --> 01:40:37,248
Empty

2017
01:40:37,504 --> 01:40:39,040
Smell blood and attack

2018
01:40:41,088 --> 01:40:41,856
I don't know

2019
01:40:47,232 --> 01:40:49,536
They get into the 28th

2020
01:40:50,560 --> 01:40:51,584
2020

2021
01:40:51,840 --> 01:40:52,608
Democratic

2022
01:40:53,376 --> 01:40:54,912
Upgrade analysis

2023
01:40:56,192 --> 01:40:56,704
Man

2024
01:40:57,216 --> 01:40:59,008
Bernie's a poop head

2025
01:40:59,264 --> 01:41:01,568
Elizabeth Warren

2026
01:41:02,080 --> 01:41:03,872
I've had a certain feeling

2027
01:41:04,128 --> 01:41:05,664
For a long time about what's going

2028
01:41:05,920 --> 01:41:07,200
As the primary

2029
01:41:07,968 --> 01:41:10,272
Heats up but I kind of felt like it would be

2030
01:41:11,808 --> 01:41:14,112
The little bit speculative of me to say

2031
01:41:14,368 --> 01:41:15,392
Chick-fil-A

2032
01:41:15,648 --> 01:41:17,184
Alex

2033
01:41:17,440 --> 01:41:18,464
Open that box for me

2034
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:25,632
Is malfunctioning

2035
01:41:32,032 --> 01:41:34,336
Choose crew like why am I here why am I doing this

2036
01:41:34,592 --> 01:41:36,384
Because he's going

2037
01:41:54,304 --> 01:42:00,448
Bringing her back and

2038
01:42:01,984 --> 01:42:06,592
You know the guilty pleasure of hoping she does because I love her so

2039
01:42:06,848 --> 01:42:12,224
It'll be really fun to have a Hillary too and I had to go through that beat out cuz I like the curvature her and

2040
01:42:12,480 --> 01:42:14,528
I think she epitomizes that

2041
01:42:20,416 --> 01:42:23,744
So long time I've had a nagging

2042
01:42:24,000 --> 01:42:24,768
Suspicion that these

2043
01:42:25,024 --> 01:42:29,632
Like they really want Hillary to call

2044
01:42:30,912 --> 01:42:33,728
So many of them made their careers off the 20s

2045
01:42:34,496 --> 01:42:37,824
Election season

2046
01:42:39,616 --> 01:42:40,128
They know

2047
01:42:40,384 --> 01:42:41,408
They need names

2048
01:42:41,664 --> 01:42:43,712
For themselves the creative cottage industries

2049
01:42:44,224 --> 01:42:44,992
And now it's

2050
01:42:46,016 --> 01:42:47,040
Petering out a little bit

2051
01:42:49,600 --> 01:42:50,624
Desperately wish

2052
01:42:50,880 --> 01:42:52,416
Hillary was there because I like

2053
01:42:53,184 --> 01:42:53,952
Galvanized

2054
01:42:55,744 --> 01:42:58,048
Really turned things

2055
01:42:58,560 --> 01:42:59,584
It made them

2056
01:43:00,096 --> 01:43:01,632
And I don't think they have faith

2057
01:43:02,144 --> 01:43:05,472
They're going to be like let's say Biden or Bernie run

2058
01:43:06,240 --> 01:43:08,288
Elizabeth Warren

2059
01:43:08,544 --> 01:43:09,824
See you later

2060
01:43:10,080 --> 01:43:11,616
He'll be able to

2061
01:43:13,152 --> 01:43:14,432
How's the same boost

2062
01:43:14,688 --> 01:43:15,456
To their Market

2063
01:43:15,712 --> 01:43:16,480
Right

2064
01:43:19,040 --> 01:43:19,552
Gasparilla

2065
01:43:21,600 --> 01:43:24,672
People on the left

2066
01:43:24,928 --> 01:43:25,440
Think a lot of

2067
01:43:25,696 --> 01:43:26,720
People on the left are like

2068
01:43:26,976 --> 01:43:32,096
You know would be great

2069
01:43:32,352 --> 01:43:36,960
More sympathetic approach but I don't

2070
01:43:37,216 --> 01:43:41,056
Do we need to get her back again to run Hillary wants to run

2071
01:43:41,312 --> 01:43:47,456
Emotions around around Hillary

2072
01:43:47,712 --> 01:43:50,784
We were so high that they got they got to ride that

2073
01:43:51,040 --> 01:43:51,808
All those people

2074
01:43:52,064 --> 01:43:53,088
You're not going to find

2075
01:43:53,344 --> 01:43:54,624
The same vehemence

2076
01:43:55,136 --> 01:43:55,904
Lock her up

2077
01:43:56,416 --> 01:43:57,696
Chance

2078
01:43:58,208 --> 01:43:58,976
Bernie Sanders

2079
01:43:59,232 --> 01:44:01,792
No and it's just not going to be there

2080
01:44:02,048 --> 01:44:08,192
He doesn't have the same 40 Years of Hillary Clinton socialist

2081
01:44:12,032 --> 01:44:12,800
Alex has

2082
01:44:13,056 --> 01:44:14,336
Attacking Hillary

2083
01:44:14,848 --> 01:44:16,128
Made so many

2084
01:44:16,896 --> 01:44:19,968
Ambivalent to positive comments about Bernie Sanders

2085
01:44:20,736 --> 01:44:21,248
Buc-ee's

2086
01:44:21,504 --> 01:44:25,600
Birdie ideal primary stolen from in like

2087
01:44:25,856 --> 01:44:32,000
In the past has worked with the rampal's of the world

2088
01:44:33,536 --> 01:44:35,328
Alex's complimented him

2089
01:44:35,584 --> 01:44:36,352
Guest War

2090
01:44:36,864 --> 01:44:37,888
Exert isn't the same

2091
01:44:38,144 --> 01:44:41,472
History that Alex has with the Clinton exactly

2092
01:44:41,728 --> 01:44:42,240
Throw on

2093
01:44:43,520 --> 01:44:46,848
He's worried about it cuz always got a dumbass

2094
01:44:51,968 --> 01:44:58,112
An election season is kind of different to go up against a guy with pretty much a 40-year track record

2095
01:44:58,368 --> 01:44:59,904
Saying

2096
01:45:00,672 --> 01:45:02,720
Having any kind of ideological consist

2097
01:45:06,816 --> 01:45:08,352
We are running to bit of trouble

2098
01:45:08,608 --> 01:45:09,888
F****** want Hillary

2099
01:45:11,424 --> 01:45:11,936
Neither punch

2100
01:45:13,216 --> 01:45:18,080
They loved it

2101
01:45:18,592 --> 01:45:20,896
In the same way that they pretended America's attention

2102
01:45:21,152 --> 01:45:23,456
In Spanish been shortened

2103
01:45:23,968 --> 01:45:26,528
Understand that Trump has made this

2104
01:45:26,784 --> 01:45:27,552
Easy for that

2105
01:45:27,808 --> 01:45:29,600
And a real challenge

2106
01:45:30,112 --> 01:45:31,136
Trump

2107
01:45:31,392 --> 01:45:31,904
Going to be

2108
01:45:32,672 --> 01:45:33,696
No

2109
01:45:33,952 --> 01:45:37,792
They're going to have to work on whether or not Charlottesville is Charlotte

2110
01:45:38,048 --> 01:45:38,560
If they have to

2111
01:45:39,584 --> 01:45:45,216
Ocasio-cortez

2112
01:45:45,728 --> 01:45:49,312
Like the best because God is a year old video of Candace Owens

2113
01:45:49,568 --> 01:45:50,848
And then lying about it

2114
01:45:51,104 --> 01:45:52,640
Video combiner

2115
01:45:52,896 --> 01:45:54,688
Not putting in a lot of work

2116
01:45:54,944 --> 01:45:56,992
Right much better

2117
01:45:58,784 --> 01:45:59,552
Use accustomed

2118
01:45:59,808 --> 01:46:01,600
To a pretty simple

2119
01:46:01,856 --> 01:46:03,136
Deflection errything

2120
01:46:04,672 --> 01:46:05,440
Did the world

2121
01:46:05,952 --> 01:46:08,768
This coming election season I don't think is going to be

2122
01:46:09,280 --> 01:46:11,840
Especially with his diminished

2123
01:46:12,352 --> 01:46:12,864
To the

2124
01:46:14,656 --> 01:46:16,704
It's going to be much tougher for him

2125
01:46:16,960 --> 01:46:17,472
To command

2126
01:46:17,728 --> 01:46:18,240
Detention

2127
01:46:19,008 --> 01:46:19,520
Deflect

2128
01:46:21,056 --> 01:46:21,568
Think you just want

2129
01:46:22,336 --> 01:46:23,872
His his

2130
01:46:24,128 --> 01:46:26,432
Yeah I breathe

2131
01:46:26,688 --> 01:46:27,712
They were all of it

2132
01:46:28,224 --> 01:46:29,504
God can you imagine

2133
01:46:30,528 --> 01:46:32,832
Loud the screen from the left would be

2134
01:46:33,088 --> 01:46:35,136
If Hillary showed up was like I'm running

2135
01:46:35,392 --> 01:46:35,904
For president

2136
01:46:36,928 --> 01:46:38,464
You could hear it from across the

2137
01:46:38,720 --> 01:46:39,232
The country that

2138
01:46:41,792 --> 01:46:47,936
What's super interesting about this when Rodger Stone

2139
01:46:48,192 --> 01:46:52,544
Amazon

2140
01:46:52,800 --> 01:46:54,336
Because these people want to replace the hit

2141
01:46:54,592 --> 01:47:00,736
They want they don't want an unfamiliar new cycle to be what 2020

2142
01:47:00,992 --> 01:47:01,504
Is about

2143
01:47:02,016 --> 01:47:03,040
They don't want to

2144
01:47:03,296 --> 01:47:04,832
Have to build up a new villain

2145
01:47:05,600 --> 01:47:07,392
Cuz that's hard that's a lot of work

2146
01:47:07,904 --> 01:47:10,208
You got to convince people to hate people

2147
01:47:10,464 --> 01:47:11,744
We have to create

2148
01:47:12,000 --> 01:47:13,024
Some sort of a larger

2149
01:47:13,280 --> 01:47:14,560
Conspiracy about Folk

2150
01:47:15,072 --> 01:47:16,864
Probably the only reason

2151
01:47:17,120 --> 01:47:17,888
Hopes

2152
01:47:18,656 --> 01:47:23,776
Busy, so she for everybody

2153
01:47:24,032 --> 01:47:25,056
Joe Biden Iraq

2154
01:47:25,568 --> 01:47:26,848
Or at least these propaganda

2155
01:47:27,104 --> 01:47:31,200
Is Michelle Obama or Hillary Clinton

2156
01:47:31,712 --> 01:47:34,784
Because they've got that already

2157
01:47:35,040 --> 01:47:35,552
They have the

2158
01:47:36,064 --> 01:47:39,136
They have the muscle memory they have the stories already built

2159
01:47:39,904 --> 01:47:40,416
@simple

2160
01:47:41,184 --> 01:47:43,744
I really want Hillary back

2161
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:44,768
But

2162
01:47:45,792 --> 01:47:47,328
Behave yourselves

2163
01:47:49,632 --> 01:47:51,424
And I think I got I think I recognized

2164
01:47:51,680 --> 01:47:52,448
Tough road ahead

2165
01:47:52,960 --> 01:47:53,728
So in his neck

2166
01:47:53,984 --> 01:47:55,008
Clip

2167
01:47:56,288 --> 01:47:57,312
Mika Brzezinski

2168
01:47:57,824 --> 01:47:58,592
Scarborough

2169
01:47:58,848 --> 01:47:59,872
The uncovered footage

2170
01:48:00,384 --> 01:48:01,152
Of

2171
01:48:01,664 --> 01:48:02,176
Jeffry Epps

2172
01:48:02,432 --> 01:48:03,968
Trump

2173
01:48:04,224 --> 01:48:06,784
Mar-A-Lago club

2174
01:48:07,040 --> 01:48:07,552
To push back

2175
01:48:08,576 --> 01:48:10,368
So what he does is what he's done since

2176
01:48:10,624 --> 01:48:11,648
Epstein a comeback in

2177
01:48:18,304 --> 01:48:20,608
And so with this club

2178
01:48:21,632 --> 01:48:22,656
People to who Club

2179
01:48:22,912 --> 01:48:23,680
And I can assure

2180
01:48:24,704 --> 01:48:27,264
30 years ago no big deal

2181
01:48:27,776 --> 01:48:28,288
Whatever

2182
01:48:29,056 --> 01:48:29,824
I don't really care

2183
01:48:30,080 --> 01:48:31,104
Any Galaxy Shooters week

2184
01:48:31,360 --> 01:48:31,872
On this subject

2185
01:48:32,128 --> 01:48:32,896
Really

2186
01:48:33,152 --> 01:48:34,176
Won't even dignify

2187
01:48:34,432 --> 01:48:34,944
Messiah

2188
01:48:35,712 --> 01:48:36,224
But

2189
01:48:39,040 --> 01:48:42,624
Alex starts talking about Joe Scarborough

2190
01:48:42,880 --> 01:48:45,440
The intern was found dead in his office

2191
01:48:46,720 --> 01:48:48,512
Oh yeah yeah it's f***** up

2192
01:48:48,768 --> 01:48:52,608
He's embellishing that story quite a bit and I don't I don't want to get into that either

2193
01:48:52,864 --> 01:48:53,632
Albert

2194
01:48:53,888 --> 01:48:54,656
Quick warning

2195
01:48:54,912 --> 01:48:55,936
This next court date is

2196
01:48:56,192 --> 01:48:56,960
Disturbing

2197
01:48:57,216 --> 01:48:57,728
2

2198
01:48:57,984 --> 01:48:59,264
A very serious level

2199
01:49:00,544 --> 01:49:01,056
Speculating

2200
01:49:01,312 --> 01:49:02,592
About Mika and Joe cell

2201
01:49:03,616 --> 01:49:04,640
In the middle of trying to

2202
01:49:04,896 --> 01:49:05,408
To deflect

2203
01:49:05,664 --> 01:49:07,968
From the Epstein clip that they aired

2204
01:49:08,224 --> 01:49:09,760
And this is so f***** up

2205
01:49:10,784 --> 01:49:12,320
She likes her daddy

2206
01:49:13,088 --> 01:49:14,368
Her daddy was a killer

2207
01:49:16,160 --> 01:49:17,696
I wonder what they talked about

2208
01:49:18,208 --> 01:49:20,256
Probably got like a tourniquet around your neck

2209
01:49:24,864 --> 01:49:25,632
Daddy material

2210
01:49:26,656 --> 01:49:28,192
What Daddy did to me

2211
01:49:29,984 --> 01:49:33,824
She's married

2212
01:49:38,688 --> 01:49:40,224
And now he's been a good servant

2213
01:49:42,528 --> 01:49:45,600
How old

2214
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:53,280
I can't imagine

2215
01:49:53,792 --> 01:49:58,144
What level of f***** up you have to be to think that's an appropriate thing

2216
01:49:58,656 --> 01:50:01,728
Put speculate about on your show

2217
01:50:01,984 --> 01:50:03,520
I understand that he

2218
01:50:03,776 --> 01:50:05,824
You know sees Mika and Joe is Target

2219
01:50:06,336 --> 01:50:08,384
And they're f****** with drop with this

2220
01:50:08,640 --> 01:50:10,432
Speaking footage so I've got to defend them

2221
01:50:10,944 --> 01:50:11,456
But like

2222
01:50:11,712 --> 01:50:14,016
Speculating about their sex life

2223
01:50:15,552 --> 01:50:18,368
Way and then also speculating that

2224
01:50:18,624 --> 01:50:20,672
Mika was molested by her father

2225
01:50:20,928 --> 01:50:22,464
Is so inappropriate

2226
01:50:22,976 --> 01:50:25,024
It's

2227
01:50:25,280 --> 01:50:26,816
If anybody cared

2228
01:50:28,608 --> 01:50:29,632
This will get you f******

2229
01:50:30,144 --> 01:50:30,656
Fired

2230
01:50:32,448 --> 01:50:37,568
I can't Alex can only exist in this territory where no one can stop him from doing stuff

2231
01:50:37,824 --> 01:50:39,872
Cuz you do stuff like this on the regular

2232
01:50:40,128 --> 01:50:40,640
That is

2233
01:50:41,152 --> 01:50:42,432
Truly disgusting

2234
01:50:42,944 --> 01:50:43,456
That

2235
01:50:43,712 --> 01:50:44,480
In private

2236
01:50:44,992 --> 01:50:45,504
I would be

2237
01:50:46,272 --> 01:50:46,784
Did you find out

2238
01:50:47,040 --> 01:50:47,552
Somebody

2239
01:50:48,064 --> 01:50:48,576
Was thinking

2240
01:50:48,832 --> 01:50:49,600
And decided to tell me

2241
01:50:50,112 --> 01:50:50,880
Let alone

2242
01:50:51,136 --> 01:50:51,904
To go on a

2243
01:50:52,672 --> 01:50:53,184
Syndicated

2244
01:50:53,440 --> 01:50:53,952
Radio

2245
01:50:54,720 --> 01:50:57,024
It's still just like it's so rough

2246
01:50:57,280 --> 01:50:57,792
Posit

2247
01:50:58,304 --> 01:50:59,584
Disordered Behavior

2248
01:51:00,096 --> 01:51:01,888
And it's what you see this is how he

2249
01:51:02,144 --> 01:51:02,912
Interact

2250
01:51:03,168 --> 01:51:04,192
With anybody who

2251
01:51:04,448 --> 01:51:04,960
Thanks

2252
01:51:05,216 --> 01:51:07,008
Is a threat

2253
01:51:07,520 --> 01:51:11,360
But he allows whatever wild speculation

2254
01:51:11,616 --> 01:51:14,432
Borders on

2255
01:51:14,944 --> 01:51:18,016
I'll be because he's couching it in that stupid like I wonder if

2256
01:51:20,832 --> 01:51:22,112
This is this is

2257
01:51:23,904 --> 01:51:24,416
Have to put up with this

2258
01:51:25,184 --> 01:51:26,208
This sort of abuse

2259
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:29,536
It's wildly inappropriate

2260
01:51:30,560 --> 01:51:31,328
Alex Alex

2261
01:51:31,584 --> 01:51:32,608
Play like all jokes

2262
01:51:32,864 --> 01:51:38,752
I'm out there

2263
01:51:39,520 --> 01:51:40,288
Your character sucks

2264
01:51:40,544 --> 01:51:41,312
That's that's

2265
01:51:41,568 --> 01:51:42,336
Your character hurts

2266
01:51:42,848 --> 01:51:43,360
That's

2267
01:51:44,128 --> 01:51:44,640
Anyway

2268
01:51:44,896 --> 01:51:49,248
I was about to after that I was about to turn off the episode

2269
01:51:52,064 --> 01:51:52,576
But I didn't

2270
01:51:52,832 --> 01:51:54,880
I kept on listening and Norm pattis

2271
01:51:55,136 --> 01:51:55,648
Just comes on

2272
01:51:57,184 --> 01:52:02,560
Nope weird

2273
01:52:03,072 --> 01:52:04,352
But Norm comes on

2274
01:52:04,608 --> 01:52:05,376
And it's just like

2275
01:52:05,888 --> 01:52:06,912
Defending Alex about it

2276
01:52:08,448 --> 01:52:10,496
I don't really care

2277
01:52:10,752 --> 01:52:12,800
Seems like more of a s*** head than he did last time

2278
01:52:14,336 --> 01:52:16,896
Because last time it was sitting next to Alex

2279
01:52:17,408 --> 01:52:19,712
Drunkenly losing it right

2280
01:52:19,968 --> 01:52:26,112
So he looked very saying and comparison

2281
01:52:26,368 --> 01:52:26,880
Situation

2282
01:52:27,392 --> 01:52:28,416
Hey white whatever hookah

2283
01:52:29,696 --> 01:52:30,464

We going on for 3 weeks

2292
01:53:02,976 --> 01:53:03,744
Insane

2293
01:53:04,768 --> 01:53:10,400
Still at about to start

2294
01:53:12,448 --> 01:53:13,728
There's always a war on it

2295
01:53:16,544 --> 01:53:17,312
Like I just

2296
01:53:19,104 --> 01:53:23,200
It's one of those things is always very difficult about the present-day stuff

2297
01:53:24,736 --> 01:53:26,784
As we go along at the board

2298
01:53:27,040 --> 01:53:27,552
The ship gets

2299
01:53:27,808 --> 01:53:30,624
Real f*****-up the more you have to recognize

2300
01:53:30,880 --> 01:53:33,184
Then what we're looking at isn't the fun show

2301
01:53:33,440 --> 01:53:34,464
It's not like

2302
01:53:34,976 --> 01:53:38,304
Alex misrepresenting the news

2303
01:53:38,560 --> 01:53:39,072
Leeds Utah

2304
01:53:39,328 --> 01:53:39,840
To figure out some

2305
01:53:40,096 --> 01:53:40,608
Something about

2306
01:53:40,864 --> 01:53:43,168
He's anti-communist sources are like

2307
01:53:43,424 --> 01:53:47,264
It's not really interesting an intellectual level you were seeing is

2308
01:53:47,776 --> 01:53:48,544
Outright Sasha

2309
01:53:48,800 --> 01:53:49,568
Just propaganda show

2310
01:53:49,824 --> 01:53:50,592
Yep like this is

2311
01:53:50,848 --> 01:53:52,384
The transition tap

2312
01:53:53,664 --> 01:53:55,968
I'm every couple days or so maybe there's something

2313
01:53:56,224 --> 01:53:57,504
The anomaly

2314
01:53:57,760 --> 01:54:00,064
Now that is interesting like his

2315
01:54:00,832 --> 01:54:01,600
Everyone

2316
01:54:01,856 --> 01:54:08,000
Go to West Virginia

2317
01:54:08,256 --> 01:54:09,792
Opposed to what the show Mostly it

2318
01:54:10,304 --> 01:54:11,072
Mostly this

2319
01:54:11,328 --> 01:54:12,096
It's mostly

2320
01:54:12,864 --> 01:54:13,376
Nativist

2321
01:54:14,144 --> 01:54:16,448
White nationalist agitation

2322
01:54:16,704 --> 01:54:19,008
It's mostly misrepresenting news stories

2323
01:54:19,264 --> 01:54:19,776
Specific

2324
01:54:20,032 --> 01:54:21,568
Luckily the further that goal

2325
01:54:24,128 --> 01:54:24,640
Seriously

2326
01:54:25,152 --> 01:54:28,480
I want to apologize if anybody

2327
01:54:28,736 --> 01:54:32,064
Felt a comparison with durations.

2328
01:54:32,320 --> 01:54:33,344
Is inappropriate

2329
01:54:33,600 --> 01:54:35,136
I understand why someone may

2330
01:54:35,648 --> 01:54:37,696
I want to call myself out is being like

2331
01:54:38,720 --> 01:54:41,280
I recognize and I don't want to minimize

2332
01:54:41,536 --> 01:54:44,352
Anybody's experiences in the Holocaust at all

2333
01:54:46,912 --> 01:54:48,448
But specifically looking at

2334
01:54:48,704 --> 01:54:49,472
The technique

2335
01:54:49,728 --> 01:54:51,008
Little-used terms

2336
01:54:51,264 --> 01:54:51,776
The propaganda

2337
01:54:52,032 --> 01:54:52,800
Are important

2338
01:54:53,056 --> 01:54:54,336
And they have historical parallel

2339
01:54:54,592 --> 01:54:56,640
What's right

2340
01:54:58,432 --> 01:54:58,944
Not paying

2341
01:54:59,968 --> 01:55:00,480
Tension

2342
01:55:00,736 --> 01:55:02,016
To the real Danger

2343
01:55:02,272 --> 01:55:04,576
It's presented by people like Alex

2344
01:55:05,088 --> 01:55:05,856
Do you think these two

2345
01:55:06,112 --> 01:55:06,624
Techniques

2346
01:55:06,880 --> 01:55:08,160
If we didn't call it out

2347
01:55:08,416 --> 01:55:09,440
The entire point

2348
01:55:09,952 --> 01:55:10,464
Comparison

2349
01:55:11,232 --> 01:55:11,744
Is

2350
01:55:12,768 --> 01:55:13,280
Keep things

2351
01:55:13,536 --> 01:55:14,304
Like that

2352
01:55:15,840 --> 01:55:18,400
So if you see something like that happen

2353
01:55:19,168 --> 01:55:19,936
And the

2354
01:55:20,192 --> 01:55:21,984
Connection is not

2355
01:55:22,752 --> 01:55:23,264
It is

2356
01:55:24,032 --> 01:55:24,544
There

2357
01:55:25,312 --> 01:55:26,336
The parallel is there

2358
01:55:26,848 --> 01:55:28,384
So that is why it is

2359
01:55:29,152 --> 01:55:29,664
So

2360
01:55:29,920 --> 01:55:31,200
Important to limit

2361
01:55:32,224 --> 01:55:32,736
Comparison

2362
01:55:32,992 --> 01:55:34,528
While at the same time 2

2363
01:55:34,784 --> 01:55:35,552
Pointed out

2364
01:55:35,808 --> 01:55:36,832
Whenever it is Jermaine

2365
01:55:37,344 --> 01:55:39,392
Whenever it is there because

2366
01:55:39,648 --> 01:55:40,160
Comparison is

2367
01:55:40,672 --> 01:55:41,952
Thing that we should all

2368
01:55:42,208 --> 01:55:43,744
Very aware of

2369
01:55:45,536 --> 01:55:46,048
User

2370
01:55:47,584 --> 01:55:48,864
Use those techniques

2371
01:55:49,376 --> 01:55:50,400
Let's play

2372
01:55:50,656 --> 01:55:51,936
They're doing it for a reason

2373
01:55:52,704 --> 01:55:53,216
Like

2374
01:55:54,752 --> 01:55:55,776
Talks about

2375
01:55:56,800 --> 01:55:58,080
Immigrants bringing disease

2376
01:55:58,848 --> 01:56:00,384
Is reminisce

2377
01:56:00,640 --> 01:56:01,152
Sent off.

2378
01:56:01,408 --> 01:56:01,920
Propaganda

2379
01:56:02,176 --> 01:56:02,944
That is

2380
01:56:04,480 --> 01:56:04,992
One of the ways

2381
01:56:05,248 --> 01:56:06,016
They demonized

2382
01:56:06,272 --> 01:56:07,808
The populations that they stopped

2383
01:56:08,064 --> 01:56:08,576
To demonize

2384
01:56:09,344 --> 01:56:10,368
They did it for a reason

2385
01:56:10,880 --> 01:56:12,160
And Alex is doing it for a reason

2386
01:56:12,416 --> 01:56:14,976
And I refuse to take

2387
01:56:16,768 --> 01:56:18,048
Which is why

2388
01:56:18,304 --> 01:56:18,816
Walmart

2389
01:56:20,608 --> 01:56:22,144
This this sort of rhetoric

2390
01:56:22,400 --> 01:56:22,912
Being

2391
01:56:25,216 --> 01:56:27,008
And then simultaneously

2392
01:56:27,264 --> 01:56:27,776
Play we see

2393
01:56:28,288 --> 01:56:29,056
The guy that Alex

2394
01:56:29,312 --> 01:56:30,080
Idolizing

2395
01:56:31,872 --> 01:56:32,896
Hosting rallies

2396
01:56:33,152 --> 01:56:34,432
Is that go the way they do

2397
01:56:36,992 --> 01:56:38,016
Ijump

2398
01:56:38,272 --> 01:56:38,784
Think

2399
01:56:40,064 --> 01:56:41,600
You got to you got to be worried

2400
01:56:43,904 --> 01:56:45,440
So anyway

2401
01:56:45,696 --> 01:56:48,000
We will I hope on Monday

2402
01:56:48,256 --> 01:56:52,096
I think I'm moving on Monday

2403
01:56:52,608 --> 01:56:54,400
That is that is now been

2404
01:56:55,680 --> 01:56:56,704
Schedule

2405
01:56:57,728 --> 01:56:58,752
Monday I'm going to boo

2406
01:56:59,008 --> 01:57:00,032
But there's still a chance

2407
01:57:00,288 --> 01:57:01,312
We'll have time to

2408
01:57:01,568 --> 01:57:02,336
Recording episode

2409
01:57:03,872 --> 01:57:04,384
Before that

2410
01:57:04,896 --> 01:57:07,968
Yeah but if we edible take off Monday apologize

2411
01:57:08,224 --> 01:57:09,504
We will be back as soon as we can

2412
01:57:10,272 --> 01:57:11,040
Appreciate everyone

2413
01:57:11,296 --> 01:57:13,088
Support considerate thoughts

2414
01:57:13,856 --> 01:57:15,392
It means a lot to me and how is helpful

2415
01:57:15,648 --> 01:57:16,160
Getting through this

2416
01:57:17,696 --> 01:57:18,208
So thank you

2417
01:57:19,744 --> 01:57:21,024
But

2418
01:57:21,280 --> 01:57:25,120
