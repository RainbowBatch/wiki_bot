13
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:55,296
Yeah

14
00:00:55,552 --> 00:00:56,832
Closure

00:01:00,928 --> 00:01:01,440

Cuz we are under understand

Dial soap

25
00:01:26,528 --> 00:01:32,672
Movie that was released last year with Gosling

Skate

29
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:45,984
Over ever-changing uninspired

30
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:47,264
Ouch

31
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:54,688
This lead kid does have the potential to one day host the podcast

32
00:01:54,944 --> 00:02:01,088
Petro Mart

33
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:03,136
Is a good one we can find that guy

34
00:02:05,184 --> 00:02:06,720
I I got out of there

35
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:12,864
I want to talk little bit about the goings-on in the world

36
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,168
You tell lost his mind

37
00:02:15,424 --> 00:02:18,496
Who were recording this here on the 14th

38
00:02:18,752 --> 00:02:20,032
On Tuesday

39
00:02:20,544 --> 00:02:25,664
And he pretended

40
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:29,248
He put out

41
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:35,648
Yeah cuz what he did is he tweeted the feel like the Communists are coming after infowars.com you got to go to news

42
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:37,440
Wars in prisonplanet.com

43
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:40,768
And then infowars.com became just a

44
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:45,632
Big thing that says Infowars is under attack and then links to his other sites

45
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:52,032
If your cycle taking down there's no damn way to all of your other stuff

46
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:55,360
Senior site down level up

47
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:56,384
By the way

48
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,664
Infowars is under attack

49
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:03,296
Hey we don't want you to be able to do what you want with your site

50
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:07,136
Be doing if you took down his servers or whatever

51
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:07,904
Conscientious

52
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:08,672
Courteous

53
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:10,464
Will allow you to redirect traffic

54
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:12,000
If you want

55
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:16,096
Perfect people to do whenever they're taking down

56
00:03:16,352 --> 00:03:19,168
Thoughtful website

57
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:23,520
It really undoes the the move of take it down

58
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:25,824
I would say I have

59
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:32,224
0 the big PR stunt

60
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,248
Rock that all I seen

61
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:34,528
People tweet

62
00:03:35,296 --> 00:03:36,576
This is so fake

63
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:38,112
Yeah and that's so

64
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:42,720
It's very light

65
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:49,120
Go f****** gogoro for not found

66
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:51,680
But it is a natural progression

67
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:55,264
Narrative

68
00:03:55,776 --> 00:04:00,896
Because the world is really like hey you suck we don't want you places

69
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:03,200
Some companies have responded

70
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:04,224
Twitter heaven

71
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,016
You know it's up there or their

72
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:07,040
It's that's all it is

73
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:07,808
He wants it

74
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:09,600
To be like they're all coordinated against

75
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:12,416
These are companies that have all made their own decisions

76
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:15,488
Vimeo

77
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:19,583
Rap

78
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:21,631
Or gif

79
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:29,823
Epperly reminiscent of a man exiled from a village and yet still allowed to have a bullhorn

80
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:36,479
Write him being on Twitter

81
00:04:38,783 --> 00:04:39,807
You guys.

82
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:50,047
I want it

83
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:50,815
Going to bed

84
00:04:51,327 --> 00:04:52,095
Imagine that

85
00:04:52,351 --> 00:04:53,119
Imagine that

86
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:55,167
Do you want to throw in a row

87
00:04:58,239 --> 00:05:00,031
We Haz jazz

88
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:09,503
Thrilled about this

00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:12,063
Covenant

90
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:13,343

We are going

99
00:05:57,887 --> 00:06:03,775
He's in his own world and I don't really care about his scrambling trying to keep his head above water we've already covered into episodes

100
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:08,895
2009 plugging along. Some updates on that in the very near future but for now

101
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:15,295
I feel like you and I are probably both a little bit exhausted

102
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:16,575
Especially today

103
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:18,367
At 8

104
00:06:19,135 --> 00:06:21,439
Run around the city all over the place on

105
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:24,511
Ehrenreich

106
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:25,791
It would have liked

107
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:29,375
I want to go check out

108
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:30,399
What Kerry Cassidy

109
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:31,167
He has for us

110
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:33,215
I'm not sure how crash

111
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:35,007
Airline closes the gate

112
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:46,015
Wow

113
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:48,575
This is the sequel to The okay

114
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:51,391
Numark Richards buddy

115
00:06:54,975 --> 00:06:55,999
And I went back

116
00:06:58,303 --> 00:06:58,815
Let me be

117
00:06:59,071 --> 00:06:59,839
F****** total

118
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:00,863
Clear with you

119
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:04,447
I wasted a lot of time watching Bad episodes

120
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:06,751
There were a couple that I don't even like

121
00:07:07,007 --> 00:07:09,567
I thought there was one where she was talking about Bilderberg

122
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:16,479
How to draw the Stark parallels between her and Alex

123
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:18,783
It's not worth going over in episode

124
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:21,087
Bilderberg

125
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:22,879
So there's that and then there was one

126
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:25,439
Eyewear she's interviewing

127
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:27,743
Infowars.com

128
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:31,839
The guy who pretends that he's a big

129
00:07:32,095 --> 00:07:33,119
So I

130
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:34,911
A lot of time trying to find

131
00:07:37,215 --> 00:07:38,495
Xfinity

132
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:39,519
He's great

133
00:07:39,775 --> 00:07:40,799
But I

134
00:07:41,823 --> 00:07:42,335
Timer

135
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:43,871
You know who never disappoint

136
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:45,151
Mark f****** Richard

137
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:48,735
I realize there's at least three of the episodes

138
00:07:51,807 --> 00:07:52,575
Before strip that

139
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:53,343
If you want to go

140
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:55,647
I believe this was

141
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:56,671
2 years ago

142
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:57,951
You're so funny

143
00:07:58,975 --> 00:07:59,487
Good morning there

144
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:02,559
Spend some time

145
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:04,095
With Mark Richard

146
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:09,983
Mark Richards episodes

147
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:11,775
Short version of it

148
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:14,591
He's a crazy dude who orchestrated murder

149
00:08:16,127 --> 00:08:18,175
In California

150
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:24,063
Something years ago, San Francisco

151
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:26,111
He did he was gay

152
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:29,439
Kingdom

153
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:31,743
I work he was the king with over

154
00:08:32,255 --> 00:08:33,279
A bunch of young kids

155
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:36,095
Who would be Lords or something along those lines

156
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:39,423
Did workout

157
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,983
His murderer was found guilty of it but Carrie cast

158
00:08:44,287 --> 00:08:46,591
The he was off-world at the time

159
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:49,407
You part of the secret space program

160
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:51,455
When the murder was committed

161
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:52,735
Between

162
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:56,063
Hotels Cary

163
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:57,855
The stupidest I've ever heard my life

164
00:08:58,111 --> 00:08:59,135
She believes all

165
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:00,927
It's nuts

166
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:07,327
We have now upon further review of Project Camelot

167
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:08,095
Besides

168
00:09:08,607 --> 00:09:09,631
She may not

169
00:09:09,887 --> 00:09:10,911
Told

170
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:16,031
As much as she says she raped

171
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:17,567
What she wants to get out of it

172
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:18,847
The good news is though

173
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:25,503
Is we don't really need to worry about our most recent episode spoiling the story

174
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:28,319
Bananas

175
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:32,927
Pieces within this episode that are fresh

176
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:34,463
That might as well be

177
00:09:34,719 --> 00:09:37,023
Current in the timeline

178
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:43,167
Yeah scholarship

179
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:44,191
On Netflix

180
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:47,263
Who is this

181
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:50,079
It really doesn't matter that much

182
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:51,103
Coming up with this stuff

183
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:53,919
Then what she thinks you studying is crazy

184
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:56,479
First thing if she is

185
00:09:56,991 --> 00:09:57,759
F****** around

186
00:09:58,015 --> 00:09:58,783
It's interesting if

187
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:01,855
Accomplice to murder

188
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:02,623
Is

189
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:06,463
Manipulating her

190
00:10:06,719 --> 00:10:07,231
If she's like

191
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:10,303
Oh this is probably what real people do

192
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:16,191
Hangout with Raptors for chocolate more fascinating still further I would say

193
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:19,263
Because we don't know that

194
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:21,567
And because she's not allowed to record it

195
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:25,919
She is never actually spoken to Mark Richards maybe she talked to him one time

196
00:10:26,175 --> 00:10:32,063
And then from here on out it's just become Sixpence kind of stuff could be talking into the mirror saying that it

197
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:32,831
Mark Richards

198
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:37,951
Just making all this b******* up on Route I seen her in a parking lot that was allegedly the bridge

199
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:40,255
Sprouts

200
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:45,631
Joanne Richard guy

201
00:10:46,143 --> 00:10:47,423
They don't get to record things

202
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:51,263
Visit Mark Richard

203
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:55,359
She's got to tell you about how she has to write everything down

204
00:10:57,919 --> 00:10:58,943
Project Camelot

205
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:05,599
Interview with Captain Mark Richards of the secret space program

206
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:17,119
I'm going to sort of the recall of everything that we talked about

207
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:18,911
Ability

208
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:24,031
I should note that we had only small pencil

209
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:36,063
Paxil

210
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:39,903
She's going the graphite think I don't know

211
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:46,303
Mechanical pencil

212
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:48,351
That's what my mind goes to

213
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:53,983
How big are her hands have we ever seen her in physical relation to another human being

214
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:56,287
She might be

215
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:58,079
Books

216
00:11:58,335 --> 00:12:01,663
But she holds up her also Giant

217
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:03,967
I don't know if those are commercially available

218
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:05,503
Giant books

219
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:11,647
They might be alcoholic

220
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:14,463
Seems like it's a possibility I don't know

221
00:12:14,975 --> 00:12:15,743
Giant or not

222
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:17,535
Gel pens with ink

223
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:18,815
We'll leave that aside

224
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:25,983
Probably just me speak about it

225
00:12:26,239 --> 00:12:26,751
Here's another thing

226
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:27,519
You can't trust

227
00:12:28,031 --> 00:12:29,823
This is not the first time they've

228
00:12:31,103 --> 00:12:31,871
To get over to the fridge

229
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:33,919
Time around

230
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:35,967
She has you meant to go

231
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:40,575
Something nefarious

232
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:43,135
First of all

233
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:50,047
Six months ago I was prevented from

234
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:58,239
Part of my face

235
00:12:58,751 --> 00:12:59,519
Looks like

236
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:00,799
Halsey

237
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:03,103
Stroke

238
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:07,455
Just woken up I just woke up this morning with it I had nothing

239
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:14,367
Went on

240
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:17,183
I think you just got Bell's palsy

241
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:23,583
Happens to people like Jimmy Pardo

242
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:30,495
What is guana half of your face will just go numb

243
00:13:30,751 --> 00:13:31,263
When you can't move it

244
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,287
Really

245
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:35,615
Did not know that that was

246
00:13:35,871 --> 00:13:40,223
I'm not crazy I've heard Bell's Palsy said many a time I thought it was like

247
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:41,759
He's like Lou Gehrig's disease

248
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:45,599
You know like there was a guy named

249
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:48,927
Alexander Graham Bell

250
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:51,487
Because I'm on the phone

251
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:53,791
Exact

252
00:13:59,167 --> 00:14:01,215
Apothecary difference

253
00:14:01,471 --> 00:14:07,615
Potatoes

254
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:11,967
Alright

255
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:16,831
The ground

256
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:19,135
What servers are called Pomme de Terre

257
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:21,439
Apple's of the ground all right I'm done with

258
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:22,463
I'm done with your friend

259
00:14:22,719 --> 00:14:27,071
Do we have any listeners in French

260
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:31,935
I see a come up in the analytic someone's listening

261
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:32,703
France

262
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:35,775
Well if you're listening in France

263
00:14:36,287 --> 00:14:37,311
F****** get on it

264
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:42,175
Call somebody call your call macron tell him to change the name

265
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:44,991
Potatoes to just like potato

266
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:51,647
Cauliflower

267
00:14:57,791 --> 00:15:03,935
No I gotta get all of the words I am frustrated with the fact

268
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:10,847
I would argue that are potatoes the ground around potatoes

269
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:13,663
7 degrees out there

270
00:15:18,527 --> 00:15:19,039
Surrounded

271
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:21,343
Took a bite out of a ground

272
00:15:21,599 --> 00:15:22,367
Probably

273
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:31,071
For the community garden

274
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:37,727
Potato potato

275
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:38,751
So

276
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:40,543
I would argue

277
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:42,079
Taylor weapon attack

278
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:43,103
This is

279
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:47,455
Bell's Palsy Isabel Baldi

280
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:50,271
Stroke I still feel bad but

281
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:51,295
Time I don't

282
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:52,319
Like 2 minutes

283
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:54,879
Capabilities

284
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:57,695
Her mental state

285
00:15:57,951 --> 00:16:03,583
Physical or even before that pretty much the same person throughout all of her videos

286
00:16:09,983 --> 00:16:13,823
I don't know man why would you go if you think it's a scalar weapon

287
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:17,407
I don't know everything about palsy that Bell's palsy

288
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:18,943
From what I understand

289
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:25,855
Mostly based on Jimmy Pardo talking about it a lot cuz he had

290
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:29,951
In some cases

291
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:31,231
Just goes away and it's

292
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:31,999
Some cases a dozen

293
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:35,071
Scary

294
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:36,095
But

295
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:36,863
If she

296
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:38,911
Didn't get any treatment writing

297
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:40,447
Possible that it would just

298
00:16:40,703 --> 00:16:43,775
Resolve itself

299
00:16:44,031 --> 00:16:44,543
You

300
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:48,639
Are really trying to make it seem like someone doesn't want you to go to Taco

301
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:49,663
Mark Richards

302
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:50,943
When in reality it's just

303
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:51,967
What happens

304
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:52,735
The people of assert

305
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:56,319
Such a big deal.

306
00:16:57,599 --> 00:17:00,159
Look you can believe

307
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:05,279
You can believe all the conspiracy theories you want but if you go to a doctor after that

308
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:08,607
You're full of s*** you're a f****** liar

309
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:09,887
Live up to your b*******

310
00:17:10,143 --> 00:17:11,423
It's kind of

311
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:14,239
Cuz it would imply a lack of

312
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:15,775
Trust in your own diagnosis

313
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:21,151
Bell's palsy

314
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:22,431
You did not

315
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:24,735
So

316
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:25,759
You know

317
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:29,087
She couldn't get over there 6 months ago cuz of the scalar weapon attack

318
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:31,903
Baba she finally does get over to the

319
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:33,951
The prison

320
00:17:34,207 --> 00:17:36,255
Brouhaha

321
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:37,023
In the prison

322
00:17:40,607 --> 00:17:44,447
I wanted to talk about was his current present conditions and

323
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:51,359
His prison conditions when I was there

324
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:53,663
Somebody had murdered

325
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:06,463
So

326
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:09,023
That's real bad

327
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:10,047
Also Market

328
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:10,815
Murderer

329
00:18:15,167 --> 00:18:16,191
Believe

330
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:23,103
And yes, it's entirely possible that someone got shanked

331
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:27,711
Not everybody

332
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:28,479
The people who have

333
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:29,759
Committed

334
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:31,807
Rhythm for murder related

335
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:34,367
Okay so maybe the murderer

336
00:18:34,623 --> 00:18:40,767
Murdery baby

337
00:18:41,023 --> 00:18:44,095
Bill says that past behavior is not a predictor of future events

338
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:45,887
Why would you punish

339
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:48,447
He only rarely committed murder

340
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:51,519
I'm not going to listen

341
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:57,919
Then like actual adjective

342
00:18:58,687 --> 00:18:59,199
Don't get me wrong

343
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:02,271
But if there's a murderer in the prison I'm going to make sure all the murderers

344
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:04,063
I'll probably in their self

345
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:04,831
Prejudicial

346
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:10,975
Do you not like stop-and-frisk

347
00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:11,999
Same thing

348
00:19:12,255 --> 00:19:18,399
There's a lot of profiling same thing just as murder one guy now you want to murder a bunch of guys

349
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:20,191
That's a false promise

350
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:24,287
I would like to change about the prison system

351
00:19:24,543 --> 00:19:28,639
I think it's a horrible to deal with

352
00:19:28,895 --> 00:19:29,919
The idea of

353
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:31,199
Generalizing

354
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:32,735
People who are

355
00:19:32,991 --> 00:19:36,063
Willing to commit a murder right probably

356
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:38,111
What's another one

357
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:39,647
That's a good point

358
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:40,927
That's a good point

359
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:43,487
Especially people who believe themselves

360
00:19:43,999 --> 00:19:45,791
Part of the program

361
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:48,095
Who telepathically communicate with rafters

362
00:19:48,351 --> 00:19:50,143
What's even if it wasn't even him

363
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:51,679
It's probably Minerva

364
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:53,215
She got pissed off

365
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:59,615
We are going to get intimate earlier but

366
00:19:59,871 --> 00:20:00,383
To the prison can do

367
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:01,663
This is

368
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:02,687
Nuts

369
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:03,455
Vista

370
00:20:03,711 --> 00:20:04,479
This clip is

371
00:20:04,735 --> 00:20:05,503
It paint

372
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:06,783
A bleak picture

373
00:20:08,063 --> 00:20:14,207
There's more to the prison story I can tell you that when I was there Market

374
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:16,511
I had very little sleep for 2 days

375
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:20,351
Because they had given him a cellmate who was very dangerous

376
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:30,079
He was someone who was saying he was not

377
00:20:30,335 --> 00:20:31,871
And talk to it and

378
00:20:38,527 --> 00:20:41,087
Not like you saying he's not whatever but

379
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:47,743
These damn clothes more like marks Richards and he's been on

380
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:49,279
On a meth high for a couple of nights

381
00:20:49,535 --> 00:20:52,095
That's possible also because this next part doesn't pass.

382
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:56,191
And he wore a Hannibal Lecter mask

383
00:20:56,703 --> 00:20:57,983
He was a younger man

384
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:03,359
Possibly

385
00:21:03,615 --> 00:21:05,919
Pockmark can handle himself and

386
00:21:10,783 --> 00:21:15,903
That person moved

387
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:19,488
Because that situation was looking extremely dire

388
00:21:20,256 --> 00:21:21,280
How are you going to get it

389
00:21:21,536 --> 00:21:22,560
Hannibal Lecter mask

390
00:21:22,816 --> 00:21:26,912
To recreationally where around in prison I feel like that might be something that the guard

391
00:21:27,424 --> 00:21:32,544
You are allowed one piece everybody

392
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:38,176
Statues people wear plaid

393
00:21:38,432 --> 00:21:39,712
Some people have

394
00:21:39,968 --> 00:21:41,248
I know a lot about the purse

395
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:42,528
Obviously

396
00:21:42,784 --> 00:21:43,552
I don't think

397
00:21:43,808 --> 00:21:44,832
Hannibal Lecter mask

398
00:21:45,088 --> 00:21:47,392
He's going to pass that even crazier

399
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:50,720
Gotta be like a little hockey

400
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:56,352
You can do better

401
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:57,888
Who's Roma movie

402
00:21:58,656 --> 00:22:04,288
Come up with something else menacing but you know what this is

403
00:22:04,544 --> 00:22:09,664
That's great

404
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:10,432
Pair the wine

405
00:22:10,688 --> 00:22:13,248
Incorrect

406
00:22:13,504 --> 00:22:16,064
Facebook

407
00:22:16,576 --> 00:22:18,112
Just another copycat killer Dan

408
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:19,648
I don't believe any

409
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:20,416
A b b

410
00:22:21,184 --> 00:22:22,464
I don't I mean that could just be

411
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:23,488
My standard

412
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:24,256
Response to every

413
00:22:28,608 --> 00:22:29,632
Hold on

414
00:22:29,888 --> 00:22:30,912
Does this mean

415
00:22:31,424 --> 00:22:33,216
This is

416
00:22:36,032 --> 00:22:37,056
Who is his

417
00:22:38,592 --> 00:22:40,896
No no no his longtime companion

418
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:41,664
No no

419
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:42,688
I think I don't

420
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,224
That guy was ever his cellmate

421
00:22:44,736 --> 00:22:45,248
Another guy in the

422
00:22:46,784 --> 00:22:47,296
I can't remember his name

423
00:22:49,344 --> 00:22:52,160
Carrie has reported that he has a lieutenant

424
00:22:54,976 --> 00:22:55,488
Which is

425
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:59,072
Some young kid

426
00:23:00,096 --> 00:23:00,608
At the prison

427
00:23:02,144 --> 00:23:03,680
Kill the Selma March

428
00:23:04,448 --> 00:23:05,728
No don't do that

429
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:07,264
And Carries like this

430
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,312
But he's a great guy like that

431
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:16,224
Did that already and that's why he's in prison

432
00:23:18,784 --> 00:23:24,928
Psychologically whatever

433
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:27,488
Re-litigate in his past

434
00:23:27,744 --> 00:23:30,560
Concept of Make Believe

435
00:23:32,096 --> 00:23:33,376
Like in line with

436
00:23:33,632 --> 00:23:34,912
Like basic psychology

437
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:37,728
Childhood

438
00:23:37,984 --> 00:23:38,496
Play out

439
00:23:39,008 --> 00:23:40,544
And have a better

440
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:43,104
Unresolved issue

441
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:48,736
Alcoholic

442
00:23:48,992 --> 00:23:51,552
Alcoholics trying to create a better outcome for it

443
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:53,856
Universal but it's a

444
00:23:54,112 --> 00:23:54,624
The prettiest

445
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:57,952
Specially with people who aren't involved

446
00:23:58,464 --> 00:23:59,232
Recovery process

447
00:24:00,512 --> 00:24:01,280
Epsom salt therapy

448
00:24:02,048 --> 00:24:03,328
But I got you just needed

449
00:24:03,584 --> 00:24:06,144
Over and over again so many of his fantasies

450
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,168
Kind of involved

451
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,704
Things that are like this is

452
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:15,104
Maybe an analogy for doing the stuff that you didn't realize what you're just saying

453
00:24:18,688 --> 00:24:23,296
I like the idea of him going around recruiting

454
00:24:23,808 --> 00:24:26,368
And telling them not to murder people that he wants them

455
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:30,976
Well I solved it I wanted that

456
00:24:31,232 --> 00:24:33,536
But I didn't even tell those kids to kill him

457
00:24:33,792 --> 00:24:34,816
I told him not to

458
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:36,864
I learned my lesson

459
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,144
Can I get out now

460
00:24:38,912 --> 00:24:39,680
No no

461
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:41,728
The other your time

462
00:24:42,496 --> 00:24:45,824
So now that we've gotten through this bit of

463
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,360
His prison conditions

464
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:50,944
Do the wacky stuff

465
00:24:51,968 --> 00:24:54,016
Talking about

466
00:24:54,272 --> 00:24:56,576
Artificial intelligence satellites

467
00:24:57,344 --> 00:25:02,464
And artificial intelligence

468
00:25:03,488 --> 00:25:06,560
British

469
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:09,376
When she said he's got into black night I was like

470
00:25:09,888 --> 00:25:10,400
Martin Lawrence

471
00:25:13,984 --> 00:25:19,104
It has wiring in a sort of which is unusual for

472
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,688
Boards and slots

473
00:25:23,456 --> 00:25:26,784
I don't understand it

474
00:25:27,040 --> 00:25:29,088
He says the wiring in place

475
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,136
Makes it very low-tech

476
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:34,208
It's much harder for the

477
00:25:34,976 --> 00:25:38,560
Artificial intelligence out there

478
00:25:38,816 --> 00:25:43,936
Two governments

479
00:25:45,728 --> 00:25:47,008
Satellites out there

480
00:25:48,032 --> 00:25:54,176
The three is

481
00:25:54,432 --> 00:25:57,504
Noticed

482
00:25:58,272 --> 00:26:00,832
There's no real further information about this

483
00:26:01,088 --> 00:26:07,232
If you're curious cuz I have no idea Black Knight artificial intelligence satellites

484
00:26:07,488 --> 00:26:11,072
God knows what the British

485
00:26:11,584 --> 00:26:12,352
That sounds right though

486
00:26:12,608 --> 00:26:17,984
It does spiritual like what

487
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,056
How do we break into that

488
00:26:21,312 --> 00:26:23,104
It is

489
00:26:24,384 --> 00:26:24,896
Meaning for wife

490
00:26:26,432 --> 00:26:27,968
Well there is one other thing is

491
00:26:28,224 --> 00:26:28,992
They're not wireless

492
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:32,064
Sure

493
00:26:32,576 --> 00:26:38,720
Bored

494
00:26:41,536 --> 00:26:47,680
You go that's why I carry traveling all the time

495
00:26:49,984 --> 00:26:52,032
Powering such a large artificial

496
00:26:52,288 --> 00:26:54,592
Intelligence cable

497
00:26:54,848 --> 00:26:56,896
So you can't pull it

498
00:26:57,152 --> 00:26:57,664
Timmy uppet

499
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:02,016
And get all the way up

500
00:27:04,064 --> 00:27:06,880
All of these things

501
00:27:08,416 --> 00:27:11,232
This is silly I'm not sure what else to say about it

502
00:27:11,488 --> 00:27:12,256
Just really give any

503
00:27:13,024 --> 00:27:13,792
Talk about other than

504
00:27:14,816 --> 00:27:15,584
There's wires

505
00:27:16,096 --> 00:27:20,192
I'm a big fan of winter blankets

506
00:27:20,448 --> 00:27:21,984
Does not ask a follow-up just like

507
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:25,312
Apparently there are a three artificial intelligence

508
00:27:25,568 --> 00:27:27,360
Satellites

509
00:27:27,616 --> 00:27:28,128
I don't know

510
00:27:28,384 --> 00:27:29,408
From the 70s

511
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,456
Now and when they get a little

512
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,016
They send a text

513
00:27:36,064 --> 00:27:37,344
Studio I realized

514
00:27:39,392 --> 00:27:42,208
Cuz now I'm curious about them as I'm staying on

515
00:27:43,744 --> 00:27:45,280
To Starstruck

516
00:27:45,536 --> 00:27:46,560
Okay that's awesome

517
00:27:48,096 --> 00:27:48,608
So Jordan

518
00:27:50,656 --> 00:27:51,424
You might know

519
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:52,448
About science

520
00:27:53,216 --> 00:27:53,984
Do you know what time

521
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:58,336
I've heard of it the dreams of men I've heard that

522
00:27:59,616 --> 00:28:05,760
Brian Herbert bulshit

523
00:28:06,016 --> 00:28:07,296
Let me tell you about

524
00:28:08,064 --> 00:28:09,088
I don't think

525
00:28:09,344 --> 00:28:11,136
Frank Herbert

526
00:28:11,392 --> 00:28:11,904
But

527
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:15,488
A very notable science fiction author comes up and Mark Richards

528
00:28:15,744 --> 00:28:16,512
Azimuth

529
00:28:17,024 --> 00:28:17,536
Later

530
00:28:18,048 --> 00:28:22,144
Recruited by Mark Scott

531
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,936
What's

532
00:28:24,192 --> 00:28:26,496
Then given information

533
00:28:26,752 --> 00:28:29,056
To augment his sci-fi story

534
00:28:29,568 --> 00:28:32,640
And this was to reveal what's going on in the secrets

535
00:28:32,896 --> 00:28:33,408
Program

536
00:28:34,688 --> 00:28:37,504
Currently there are several other sci-fi authors

537
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:39,808
Do the same thing happened to

538
00:28:40,064 --> 00:28:43,904
However

539
00:28:44,672 --> 00:28:45,184
I make sense

540
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,024
Why

541
00:28:51,584 --> 00:28:54,400
Because you can't come out and say like

542
00:28:54,656 --> 00:28:57,728
This is what happened

543
00:28:58,752 --> 00:28:59,264
Securities

544
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:00,544
Fears

545
00:29:07,968 --> 00:29:14,112
I'm doing drugs and I'm out of my house

546
00:29:14,368 --> 00:29:16,160
Say that kind of stuff and I kind of

547
00:29:18,464 --> 00:29:21,792
I don't know I've read a lot of Philip K dick

548
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:24,608
I think

549
00:29:24,864 --> 00:29:25,376
Degrading

550
00:29:25,632 --> 00:29:26,144
He's alright

551
00:29:28,192 --> 00:29:29,472
It is

552
00:29:29,728 --> 00:29:30,496
Geography

553
00:29:31,008 --> 00:29:31,520
But that's just because

554
00:29:31,776 --> 00:29:32,544
He's written like what

555
00:29:33,056 --> 00:29:37,152
Novels you wrote a lot

556
00:29:39,456 --> 00:29:39,968
What are you got

557
00:29:40,736 --> 00:29:42,272
I don't know

558
00:29:42,528 --> 00:29:45,344
I haven't studied his catalog nearly as much

559
00:29:45,856 --> 00:29:47,648
But that's just because

560
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,952
My dear buddy Nick Rowley

561
00:29:50,464 --> 00:29:51,744
Super 8 in real life

562
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,536
I have never read much

563
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:58,400
And I don't think that I think it's

564
00:29:58,656 --> 00:29:59,168
Degrading

565
00:29:59,424 --> 00:29:59,936
Uart

566
00:30:00,192 --> 00:30:00,704
To use

567
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:01,984
The arguments like this like

568
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,008
Someone couldn't

569
00:30:03,264 --> 00:30:06,592
Possibly come up with these ideas they had to be given to them by the

570
00:30:06,848 --> 00:30:07,872
Secret space program

571
00:30:08,128 --> 00:30:08,640
In order to

572
00:30:08,896 --> 00:30:09,664
Service like

573
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,456
Preemptive programming

574
00:30:11,968 --> 00:30:12,992
Because further I don't know

575
00:30:13,248 --> 00:30:14,016
If you read a bunch of

576
00:30:14,272 --> 00:30:14,784
You stuff I don't

577
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:15,552
Think it has anything

578
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:17,088
To do a lot of the time with

579
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:19,904
Anything real

580
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:22,464
Anything real in their world

581
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,000
You know there's just

582
00:30:24,256 --> 00:30:25,280
Like I don't know

583
00:30:25,536 --> 00:30:27,072
Man in the High Castle what is that at

584
00:30:27,328 --> 00:30:28,352
How to do the secret space program

585
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:29,632
Morrow

586
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:32,704
Clearly

587
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:36,800
Christmas program and there's an alternate reality

588
00:30:37,056 --> 00:30:38,080
Beat it in creating this

589
00:30:38,848 --> 00:30:42,688
Realize that we can't have the Nazis running everything

590
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:49,600
The reality that could have been and then they approved him

591
00:30:52,928 --> 00:30:56,768
Otherwise nobody would f****** know how great they were

592
00:30:57,024 --> 00:30:59,840
What about flow my tears the policeman said

593
00:31:00,096 --> 00:31:01,632
Are those tears

594
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:09,824
What do they what do they leave about then

595
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:16,224
No artistic title but I'll tell you right now

596
00:31:18,016 --> 00:31:19,040
To me I don't know what that word mean

597
00:31:21,088 --> 00:31:22,624
It's a bummer cuz I like I like

598
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,160
You're right there's a lot of trash in

599
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:25,696
Things like

600
00:31:27,488 --> 00:31:28,000
Is amazing

601
00:31:28,256 --> 00:31:28,768
Ubiquitous

602
00:31:29,792 --> 00:31:31,584
Motto Palmer Eldritch

603
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,120
But these are really great

604
00:31:34,144 --> 00:31:35,168
Books that are fun

605
00:31:35,424 --> 00:31:37,216
And interesting ideas are interesting

606
00:31:39,008 --> 00:31:40,288
But for them to be sitting here and be like

607
00:31:40,544 --> 00:31:43,360
Yeah that's all just because the Dutchmen told him to write that

608
00:31:45,408 --> 00:31:51,552
To me I hear a certain amount of angry creative people because they

609
00:31:51,808 --> 00:31:53,600
This is so on creative

610
00:31:53,856 --> 00:32:00,000
That's it that's what I'm saying it just like I just like conservative assholes usually wind up going back

611
00:32:00,256 --> 00:32:01,792
Can finding out that they were shity f******

612
00:32:02,048 --> 00:32:06,144
Comedians are trying to say

613
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:09,728
No my creativity in making up this s***

614
00:32:09,984 --> 00:32:13,312
Is so much more interesting than your actual creativity

615
00:32:13,824 --> 00:32:15,360
In making up what you made up

616
00:32:15,616 --> 00:32:21,760
You have to tear down Philip K dick in order to build up your own all of his ideas

617
00:32:22,016 --> 00:32:23,552
Reality mine

618
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:24,832
Rude

619
00:32:25,344 --> 00:32:27,392
Creativity or whatever the f*** it is I don't know

620
00:32:27,648 --> 00:32:28,416
I suppose so

621
00:32:28,672 --> 00:32:31,488
Also I will all cops

622
00:32:31,744 --> 00:32:32,512
Secret space program is

623
00:32:32,768 --> 00:32:33,280
Responsible for

624
00:32:35,072 --> 00:32:35,584
Together

625
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:36,864
Cuz I was not very good

626
00:32:37,376 --> 00:32:38,144
Just about

627
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:41,728
What what is Philip

628
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:49,152
Racist repressed sexual desires

629
00:32:49,408 --> 00:32:51,456
I don't know I don't know if

630
00:32:51,712 --> 00:32:52,480
The books that I listened to

631
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:54,528
Goodwin

632
00:32:58,880 --> 00:32:59,904
Is really just about like

633
00:33:00,672 --> 00:33:02,464
There's sort of an allegory of like

634
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:03,232
Garden of Eve

635
00:33:03,744 --> 00:33:05,792
Kind of thing

636
00:33:06,048 --> 00:33:06,560
About weather

637
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:13,472
I mean it

638
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,520
Very of it

639
00:33:15,776 --> 00:33:21,920
Hi Missy say it could be said to look at it through

640
00:33:22,176 --> 00:33:24,224
49

641
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:26,528
Hero dolls

642
00:33:26,784 --> 00:33:27,808
Crazy books about life

643
00:33:28,064 --> 00:33:29,856
Space you know all this

644
00:33:30,368 --> 00:33:31,904
This weird stuff

645
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,696
I like this book is very

646
00:33:33,952 --> 00:33:34,720
Very basic

647
00:33:35,232 --> 00:33:36,000
It's interesting

648
00:33:36,256 --> 00:33:37,792
Well that's it

649
00:33:38,048 --> 00:33:42,912
His career that like CS Lewis wrote a bunch of basic boring life photo

650
00:33:43,168 --> 00:33:44,192
History of logical

651
00:33:49,824 --> 00:33:50,336
It was not

652
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,128
I think it's good

653
00:33:52,384 --> 00:33:53,664
Is alright

654
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:59,040
Did he did he wind up having five bucks is five or six in The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe

655
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:06,208
I was talking about

656
00:34:06,976 --> 00:34:10,048
The Silver Chair Prince Caspian

657
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:13,888
How's work

658
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:19,008
I think is blurred line

659
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:22,080
You're stepping into my world son

660
00:34:22,592 --> 00:34:24,128
I don't want to do this

661
00:34:24,384 --> 00:34:30,272
I really don't want to do this

662
00:34:30,528 --> 00:34:33,088
KSAT live

663
00:34:33,344 --> 00:34:34,368
Weather all the dreams

664
00:34:37,696 --> 00:34:38,208
Your cell carrier mark

665
00:34:38,976 --> 00:34:39,488
Okay.

666
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:40,512
Just did a lot of

667
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,816
So is it

668
00:34:43,072 --> 00:34:44,608
We hear something

669
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:46,912
2016

670
00:34:47,424 --> 00:34:47,936
Era

671
00:34:48,192 --> 00:34:48,960
Is it really

672
00:34:50,496 --> 00:34:52,544
Read between the people we look at

673
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:55,872
With the gilding of

674
00:34:56,384 --> 00:34:57,152
Decorating

675
00:35:06,112 --> 00:35:11,232
If possible that she's had a change of heart

676
00:35:15,072 --> 00:35:17,120
Interesting that throughout the

677
00:35:17,376 --> 00:35:19,168
Just the entire spec

678
00:35:19,424 --> 00:35:20,704
Guillermo's like you know

679
00:35:21,984 --> 00:35:23,264
Jim Bakker isn't

680
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:28,384
Anti-putin at all with the presentation that they are Christian Nation what have you

681
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:30,688
Super on board

682
00:35:30,944 --> 00:35:33,504
By what their nationalist

683
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,296
Right now

684
00:35:35,552 --> 00:35:37,600
Because they

685
00:35:38,112 --> 00:35:39,904
They're no longer with the Reptoid

686
00:35:40,928 --> 00:35:42,720
Now you can take that however you want to but

687
00:35:43,488 --> 00:35:44,768
It's weird all of these people

688
00:35:45,024 --> 00:35:45,792
Interesting

689
00:35:46,048 --> 00:35:47,328
It's almost like they're all under the

690
00:35:47,584 --> 00:35:48,096
This way

691
00:35:48,352 --> 00:35:49,632
Some sort of PR machine

692
00:35:49,888 --> 00:35:51,168
Being run by the Kremlin

693
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:55,264
I don't know if I've ever heard of Russian propaganda

694
00:36:00,128 --> 00:36:01,664
Is colored

695
00:36:02,176 --> 00:36:08,320
All of his say that and then we go back to the

696
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:10,112
7

697
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:12,416
At least I'm special

698
00:36:12,672 --> 00:36:17,536
I don't know what I can't make a bra declaration

699
00:36:17,792 --> 00:36:19,584
About this cuz I don't know who the f*** would be

700
00:36:20,096 --> 00:36:21,888
Caring about what Kerry Cassidy

701
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:25,216
I don't think that the Russian government necessarily

702
00:36:25,472 --> 00:36:25,984
Is super

703
00:36:27,264 --> 00:36:29,056
We got a swing swery Carey

704
00:36:29,568 --> 00:36:30,336
But there is

705
00:36:30,592 --> 00:36:31,360
There is something

706
00:36:31,616 --> 00:36:32,128
There's something

707
00:36:32,384 --> 00:36:32,896
I'm not sure what it is

708
00:36:33,664 --> 00:36:35,712
I think when you go

709
00:36:35,968 --> 00:36:37,504
Through all of this FF

710
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:38,528
Talked about with

711
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:39,552
Especially

712
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:42,112
As a you know as it is

713
00:36:42,368 --> 00:36:43,136
Pointed out before

714
00:36:43,648 --> 00:36:44,672
She is racist

715
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:46,720
Towards her imaginary

716
00:36:54,144 --> 00:36:56,448
Russia has a

717
00:36:57,728 --> 00:37:00,032
Wait I mean what would you call it like a

718
00:37:00,288 --> 00:37:02,592
Something similar to a white ethnostate

719
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:03,872
Bright

720
00:37:04,384 --> 00:37:05,152
None of it is

721
00:37:05,664 --> 00:37:07,200
You know what

722
00:37:07,456 --> 00:37:09,248
Itself to be what the propaganda says it is

723
00:37:11,552 --> 00:37:12,832
It is part of that like

724
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:16,160
Ideal to so many of these people of

725
00:37:16,416 --> 00:37:16,928
White Nation

726
00:37:17,184 --> 00:37:19,232
A white people black Nations for black p

727
00:37:19,488 --> 00:37:24,864
People get over here Raptors get over here like every Wonder

728
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:26,656
To stay away from each other

729
00:37:26,912 --> 00:37:30,752
And then problems will be solved

730
00:37:31,008 --> 00:37:35,872
From all of the support of Putin is not necessarily

731
00:37:37,152 --> 00:37:39,200
Russia versus

732
00:37:39,712 --> 00:37:41,760
Let's make sure that

733
00:37:42,016 --> 00:37:43,040
Ethnically cleanse

734
00:37:43,808 --> 00:37:48,416
Whether it be alien or human

735
00:37:48,672 --> 00:37:51,744
The fucken say most of the

736
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,024
These people probably

737
00:37:53,536 --> 00:37:54,816
You know I mean we're all seeing

738
00:37:55,072 --> 00:37:55,584
People who are

739
00:37:56,864 --> 00:37:57,376
Caucasian

740
00:37:57,632 --> 00:37:58,144
Who are the

741
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:00,192
Mouthpiece

742
00:38:00,704 --> 00:38:01,728
Budgetary

743
00:38:06,336 --> 00:38:06,848
Kefir

744
00:38:07,104 --> 00:38:07,872
From Russia

745
00:38:08,384 --> 00:38:08,896
Necessarily

746
00:38:09,408 --> 00:38:11,200
White people don't have a lots of

747
00:38:13,504 --> 00:38:16,064
Well especially in America

748
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:18,112
Especially in America in the car

749
00:38:18,624 --> 00:38:22,208
Yeah that's going to be all that threatened does can't

750
00:38:23,488 --> 00:38:25,024
On the global

751
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:28,096
Right

752
00:38:28,352 --> 00:38:29,376
Switch to the Orthodox Church

753
00:38:30,144 --> 00:38:31,424
That would be a little bit tired

754
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:33,984
Yeah the Russian Orthodox Church

755
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:36,288
Lot of rules that are about

756
00:38:36,544 --> 00:38:42,688
I don't know I don't read anything about the most religions

757
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,224
I think that's

758
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:49,088
Picture of

759
00:38:50,624 --> 00:38:51,648
Is it works its way

760
00:38:51,904 --> 00:38:54,208
To wherever it

761
00:38:54,464 --> 00:38:55,232
And I called everybody else

762
00:38:55,488 --> 00:38:57,536
I don't know exactly what

763
00:38:57,792 --> 00:38:58,304
To think about this

764
00:38:58,560 --> 00:38:59,328
Move on

765
00:38:59,584 --> 00:39:00,096
Because

766
00:39:00,608 --> 00:39:01,376
Cinemark at this point

767
00:39:04,192 --> 00:39:07,008
Formation about the

768
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:08,800
You're not going to get it

769
00:39:09,824 --> 00:39:10,848
Or something about him

770
00:39:11,616 --> 00:39:14,176
I asked Mark about the recent book

771
00:39:14,688 --> 00:39:15,456
Devils

772
00:39:15,712 --> 00:39:18,016
Chess board

773
00:39:18,528 --> 00:39:20,064
And

774
00:39:29,536 --> 00:39:35,680
Friendly and protective originally towards marking his father but changed his

775
00:39:37,984 --> 00:39:39,776
That Mark was siding with Kennedy

776
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:44,384
Marcus became persona non grata

777
00:39:45,408 --> 00:39:47,456
10 years old

778
00:39:53,088 --> 00:39:54,112
Goodwill

779
00:39:55,136 --> 00:40:00,768
Already he was already he's already being brought into the fold

780
00:40:03,328 --> 00:40:04,096
Right right

781
00:40:04,352 --> 00:40:10,496
Remember that much

782
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:13,312
I don't know

783
00:40:13,568 --> 00:40:14,336
I know that Margaret

784
00:40:15,104 --> 00:40:16,384
The boy probably was one of the most

785
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:17,152
Capable

786
00:40:17,408 --> 00:40:19,456
Genius brilliant

787
00:40:19,968 --> 00:40:26,112
100 books on World War

788
00:40:31,744 --> 00:40:33,280
Second help kill a guy

789
00:40:33,792 --> 00:40:34,560
Prison forever

790
00:40:35,328 --> 00:40:36,352
Start lying about all this s***

791
00:40:36,608 --> 00:40:37,632
But

792
00:40:38,656 --> 00:40:39,168
I just

793
00:40:39,424 --> 00:40:45,568
Timeline problem be damn cuz game we always talk about this

794
00:40:45,824 --> 00:40:46,592
Time is a flat circle

795
00:40:47,104 --> 00:40:48,128
Absolutely

796
00:40:48,384 --> 00:40:49,664
It's funny though that Allen Dulles

797
00:40:51,712 --> 00:40:52,480
You guys are cool

798
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:54,272

F*** you radar

801
00:40:58,368 --> 00:40:59,904
I like imagining this conversation

802
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:02,464
She had with him because you know that she was like

803
00:41:02,976 --> 00:41:06,304
I asked you about this

804
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:07,072
Any likes

805
00:41:13,472 --> 00:41:14,240
But I'll tell you what

806
00:41:14,752 --> 00:41:15,264
Dallas

807
00:41:16,544 --> 00:41:17,056
Did not like us

808
00:41:17,312 --> 00:41:18,080
Whenever we did

809
00:41:18,336 --> 00:41:19,872
What was it Dallas was talking about

810
00:41:20,128 --> 00:41:21,920
I don't know who is I mean I know him

811
00:41:22,176 --> 00:41:25,760
Could you leave me on a little bit further

812
00:41:26,528 --> 00:41:29,344
What I told you that Asimov would come

813
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:30,112
Coming up but I forgot

814
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:33,696
Eclipse

815
00:41:33,952 --> 00:41:37,280
Clarke and Isaac Asimov were also people that the Dutchman

816
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:41,376
Information program arrived in all this

817
00:41:48,288 --> 00:41:48,800
G stuff to

818
00:41:49,056 --> 00:41:50,848
Build up their science fiction

819
00:41:51,872 --> 00:41:53,663
She goes on to say that you was supposed

820
00:41:54,175 --> 00:41:54,687
If you are thirsty

821
00:41:54,943 --> 00:41:56,479
Clark

822
00:41:56,991 --> 00:42:02,623
Speculating

823
00:42:02,879 --> 00:42:05,183
Because they were going to talk to.

824
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:07,231
Corsican goes back to the scalar weapons

825
00:42:07,743 --> 00:42:09,023
Sounds sounds

826
00:42:09,535 --> 00:42:12,095
Yeah so sorry I forgot

827
00:42:12,351 --> 00:42:14,143
Explain the three types of Men In Black

828
00:42:14,399 --> 00:42:15,679
And they're out

829
00:42:16,447 --> 00:42:18,239
Oh I thought they were all going to be different

830
00:42:18,495 --> 00:42:19,263
Versions of Wilson

831
00:42:19,519 --> 00:42:21,567
Guys dressed in black remember that

832
00:42:21,823 --> 00:42:23,359
River face-to-face

833
00:42:24,895 --> 00:42:27,967
Alright alright alright

834
00:42:28,223 --> 00:42:30,015
The movie Caroline

835
00:42:31,295 --> 00:42:33,599
So now we jump back into the episode

836
00:42:33,855 --> 00:42:36,415
Mark of the Dutchman new Allen Dulles

837
00:42:36,671 --> 00:42:37,951
They supported JFK

838
00:42:38,207 --> 00:42:39,231
It is next

839
00:42:39,743 --> 00:42:41,791
Mark is heavily implying the aliens killed

840
00:42:42,559 --> 00:42:44,607
She also said that

841
00:42:45,375 --> 00:42:49,727
Yes they thought Johnson was The Mastermind originally

842
00:42:53,055 --> 00:42:55,359
Johnson was in pain

843
00:43:00,991 --> 00:43:02,015
Either of them

844
00:43:06,111 --> 00:43:07,903
And orchestrated by

845
00:43:09,183 --> 00:43:10,719
What is nesting

846
00:43:13,279 --> 00:43:14,047
Factions

847
00:43:14,815 --> 00:43:16,351
And on a much higher level

848
00:43:16,863 --> 00:43:19,167
Call Marquita

849
00:43:19,423 --> 00:43:20,703
More about it

850
00:43:27,103 --> 00:43:29,919
The association Leavenworth

851
00:43:30,431 --> 00:43:31,967
Is a military prison with a

852
00:43:32,223 --> 00:43:32,735
Much

853
00:43:34,527 --> 00:43:37,087
More dire circumstance than the

854
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:40,671
Medium security prison that he's in

855
00:43:40,927 --> 00:43:41,695
Time

856
00:43:42,207 --> 00:43:42,719
Mediums

857
00:43:42,975 --> 00:43:44,767
Show me

858
00:43:48,863 --> 00:43:50,399
What about a private prison

859
00:43:50,655 --> 00:43:52,447
The only reason that I'm

860
00:43:52,703 --> 00:43:53,215
If

861
00:43:53,471 --> 00:43:55,775
Mark Richards was in a private prison IV like

862
00:43:57,567 --> 00:43:59,615
Prison where

863
00:44:00,639 --> 00:44:02,431
The same as it is now but they allow camera

864
00:44:02,943 --> 00:44:04,223
Cuz I want

865
00:44:04,479 --> 00:44:09,855
I want to see that this interview amazing a reality TV show

866
00:44:10,111 --> 00:44:16,255
Dart.org

867
00:44:20,095 --> 00:44:22,911
The Pretender real start one up get a camera

868
00:44:23,167 --> 00:44:24,959
Yeah that's the only that's the only

869
00:44:25,983 --> 00:44:26,751
Ivory

870
00:44:29,567 --> 00:44:32,127
If they actually recorded their conversation

871
00:44:38,271 --> 00:44:42,367
What is The Voice

872
00:44:46,463 --> 00:44:52,607
Give me a pencil

873
00:44:53,375 --> 00:44:54,911
Google Play

874
00:45:03,871 --> 00:45:10,015
That's one fat one possibility

875
00:45:10,271 --> 00:45:12,063
Teenagers to murder four of those he was like

876
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:18,463
Not if he hit somebody with a hammer and then talk and then Little Star

877
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:21,535
Cars popped out little imaginary

878
00:45:21,791 --> 00:45:24,095
Boring

879
00:45:24,351 --> 00:45:30,495
If you see them doing a salt or something like that like if you see them through a crime

880
00:45:32,031 --> 00:45:33,567
Oh you know

881
00:45:33,823 --> 00:45:34,335
Kingpin

882
00:45:35,871 --> 00:45:40,479
Who owns broker

883
00:45:40,735 --> 00:45:43,039
It turns into a Looney Tune

884
00:45:43,807 --> 00:45:45,087
I don't know

885
00:45:45,343 --> 00:45:47,135
That

886
00:45:47,391 --> 00:45:49,439
I got to stop to do that voice forever

887
00:45:54,303 --> 00:45:57,631
I'm so now we get into some aliens what they're up to

888
00:45:57,887 --> 00:45:58,655
What are they up to

889
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:02,751
He said the dracos are working with the Reptoid

890
00:46:03,007 --> 00:46:08,127
Straightforward if you're the enemy and they want something or you're in the way

891
00:46:08,639 --> 00:46:11,967
They deal with you more directly I like to know where they stand

892
00:46:12,479 --> 00:46:14,783
He said the reptoids who are

893
00:46:15,295 --> 00:46:17,087
Raptor hybrid

894
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:20,415
Are more nefarious but they are working together

895
00:46:21,183 --> 00:46:23,487
He said the dracos are also working with

896
00:46:24,767 --> 00:46:25,279
Undoubtedly

897
00:46:26,559 --> 00:46:27,071
Attracts

898
00:46:27,327 --> 00:46:27,839
Sure

899
00:46:28,095 --> 00:46:30,655
That means the reptoids are all the Chinese

900
00:46:30,911 --> 00:46:35,263
If the Raptors

901
00:46:35,775 --> 00:46:37,055
Logically speaking they're all working

902
00:46:39,103 --> 00:46:39,615
Right

903
00:46:39,871 --> 00:46:40,383
Now

904
00:46:40,639 --> 00:46:41,919
Here's the implication there though

905
00:46:42,943 --> 00:46:44,479
Once you add human blood

906
00:46:44,735 --> 00:46:46,783
Do something it becomes far less

907
00:46:47,039 --> 00:46:49,599
Honest

908
00:46:50,111 --> 00:46:54,719
Well you are near something

909
00:46:56,255 --> 00:46:58,815
Will the argument is the Raptors are the good ones

910
00:46:59,071 --> 00:47:01,887
Hangout

911
00:47:02,143 --> 00:47:05,727
No but you're right once you put the human blood in their becomes a Reptoid

912
00:47:07,007 --> 00:47:10,335
Play Rittz

913
00:47:16,991 --> 00:47:19,807
Morningstar Church

914
00:47:20,063 --> 00:47:23,647
I'd also like to save this is another point of similarity in these

915
00:47:23,903 --> 00:47:26,463
These worlds Chinese are working with evil alien

916
00:47:27,231 --> 00:47:28,511
And the Chinese are big villain

917
00:47:29,023 --> 00:47:29,535
So

918
00:47:29,791 --> 00:47:30,303
Cool

919
00:47:34,143 --> 00:47:36,703
Now where you I halfway expect

920
00:47:37,727 --> 00:47:38,495
Some point

921
00:47:39,007 --> 00:47:40,031
Forever my crutches

922
00:47:40,287 --> 00:47:40,799
To be like

923
00:47:41,055 --> 00:47:47,199
Also did you know that the dracos vaginas are sideways

924
00:47:47,455 --> 00:47:50,783
Alright

925
00:47:53,855 --> 00:47:54,623
Joke

926
00:47:54,879 --> 00:47:55,903
Although I would like that

927
00:47:56,159 --> 00:47:56,671
To be the thing that's

928
00:47:56,927 --> 00:48:01,535
Taking out if we ever get like big enough to be right wing troll

929
00:48:02,815 --> 00:48:05,375
Are you going to take these down I want my voice

930
00:48:06,399 --> 00:48:10,495
To be the one clip

931
00:48:10,751 --> 00:48:16,895
2 taken out of context

932
00:48:17,151 --> 00:48:18,175
Go for it

933
00:48:18,431 --> 00:48:22,015
Nerva

934
00:48:22,271 --> 00:48:24,063
Here's where that happened

935
00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:27,391
It doesn't sound good

936
00:48:28,671 --> 00:48:34,303
Minerva

937
00:48:34,815 --> 00:48:37,119
He's aware of that and

938
00:48:37,375 --> 00:48:38,655
In touch with her

939
00:48:39,935 --> 00:48:44,031
Is the Futurama episode all over

940
00:48:47,615 --> 00:48:49,663
In the solar system

941
00:48:50,687 --> 00:48:51,455
Galaxy

942
00:48:52,223 --> 00:48:56,575
She is specifically I guess

943
00:48:56,831 --> 00:48:57,343
Somewhere

944
00:48:58,623 --> 00:48:59,647
Alterra

945
00:49:00,159 --> 00:49:01,695
Where she's in touch

946
00:49:02,207 --> 00:49:03,231
In touch with

947
00:49:06,815 --> 00:49:07,327
She's a

948
00:49:07,583 --> 00:49:08,095
She's a

949
00:49:08,351 --> 00:49:08,863
Huntress

950
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:09,887
Spacecraft

951
00:49:10,399 --> 00:49:16,543
I choose as a life sentence in prison

952
00:49:19,615 --> 00:49:22,175
Loved fries so much

953
00:49:22,431 --> 00:49:23,967
You just disappeared

954
00:49:24,479 --> 00:49:25,503
Minerva of course

955
00:49:25,759 --> 00:49:26,527
Being immortal

956
00:49:28,831 --> 00:49:29,343
But

957
00:49:30,111 --> 00:49:31,647
There are a lot of other dogs out there

958
00:49:32,159 --> 00:49:35,999
True how many of them were would be loyal and I will be filled with love

959
00:49:36,511 --> 00:49:37,791
Enough

960
00:49:38,047 --> 00:49:38,559
Fry's

961
00:49:39,327 --> 00:49:39,839
Damn

962
00:49:40,095 --> 00:49:42,399
This whole time

963
00:49:45,471 --> 00:49:49,055
Tell other later on Joey find out that she breaks them out regularly

964
00:49:49,311 --> 00:49:50,079
They still go joyriding

965
00:49:50,847 --> 00:49:55,967
No I don't I don't know cuz I think that's all like astral travel

966
00:49:56,223 --> 00:49:58,527
I think we speculated that if you have all this

967
00:49:58,783 --> 00:50:01,087
You could break out of prison so I can do that

968
00:50:01,343 --> 00:50:02,623
I think that was one of our

969
00:50:05,183 --> 00:50:05,951
I'm through brains

970
00:50:11,071 --> 00:50:15,935
But Minerva's in artificial intelligence

971
00:50:16,447 --> 00:50:19,519
Or even if he did go visit her

972
00:50:20,031 --> 00:50:20,543
They couldn't come

973
00:50:20,799 --> 00:50:22,847
No because he's also biological

974
00:50:23,359 --> 00:50:25,151
Biological artificial until

975
00:50:28,991 --> 00:50:30,527
There's a crisis in the world

976
00:50:30,783 --> 00:50:31,295
Refugees

977
00:50:32,831 --> 00:50:38,975
I assume that not we're not talking about actual refugees were not talk about Syria we're talking about

978
00:50:39,231 --> 00:50:40,767
About

979
00:50:41,023 --> 00:50:42,047
Marc Marquez

980
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:43,839
Marcus V on map

981
00:50:44,095 --> 00:50:46,911
You're the bleach take on this and I

982
00:50:47,167 --> 00:50:48,191
I don't think

983
00:50:48,447 --> 00:50:51,263
Okay

984
00:50:53,311 --> 00:50:54,591
He said the first

985
00:50:55,359 --> 00:50:58,175
Wave of Syrian refugees that you heard about

986
00:50:58,431 --> 00:50:59,711
Of which there are around 2

987
00:50:59,967 --> 00:51:00,991
100000

988
00:51:02,527 --> 00:51:03,039
He said

989
00:51:03,295 --> 00:51:09,183
All the refugees there are because of

990
00:51:11,743 --> 00:51:14,303
We rounded up and ended up on planet

991
00:51:16,607 --> 00:51:17,631
Flavor food

992
00:51:20,191 --> 00:51:25,055
By now

993
00:51:26,591 --> 00:51:27,359
I don't know if

994
00:51:27,615 --> 00:51:29,407
Better or worse than the reality

995
00:51:30,431 --> 00:51:31,199
It's worse

996
00:51:32,991 --> 00:51:33,759
You you

997
00:51:34,271 --> 00:51:35,807
No it's worse but it's cowardly

998
00:51:36,063 --> 00:51:38,367
Because what it is is I don't need to worry about that

999
00:51:38,623 --> 00:51:43,743
We only need to worry about 200,000 pretending that the problem doesn't really

1000
00:51:44,511 --> 00:51:46,047
It's just like

1001
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:47,071
Buy Raptors

1002
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:52,191
Convenient on going crazy

1003
00:51:52,447 --> 00:51:54,495
Just that people are being right

1004
00:51:56,799 --> 00:51:57,311
Surviving

1005
00:51:59,871 --> 00:52:00,383
16

1006
00:52:00,639 --> 00:52:02,175
So I assume it's all been fixed

1007
00:52:02,687 --> 00:52:06,015
Binary translator

1008
00:52:08,831 --> 00:52:12,159
In the past all of these problems have been solved

1009
00:52:12,415 --> 00:52:13,951
Certainly not ongoing

1010
00:52:22,399 --> 00:52:23,167
Really

1011
00:52:23,423 --> 00:52:23,935
Pacific

1012
00:52:25,215 --> 00:52:27,519
Now we move onto Museum

1013
00:52:28,031 --> 00:52:28,543
The character want to

1014
00:52:31,359 --> 00:52:33,151
A little bit of information about it

1015
00:52:33,663 --> 00:52:34,687
Display she saw

1016
00:52:35,711 --> 00:52:40,063
We talked about the Anunnaki skeleton in London

1017
00:52:41,087 --> 00:52:43,391
I had seen this summer

1018
00:52:43,647 --> 00:52:45,183
I'm taking a photo of

1019
00:52:48,255 --> 00:52:50,303
He agrees that it wasn't

1020
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:53,375
Disease and desist with probably inauthentic

1021
00:52:53,887 --> 00:52:56,191
Annunaki skeleton

1022
00:52:56,447 --> 00:52:56,959
Perfect

1023
00:52:57,983 --> 00:52:59,263
Healthy and

1024
00:52:59,519 --> 00:53:00,287
Good work

1025
00:53:00,543 --> 00:53:04,639
Westchester

1026
00:53:05,407 --> 00:53:09,759
Those f****** British

1027
00:53:10,015 --> 00:53:10,527
No no

1028
00:53:10,783 --> 00:53:12,063
But you know what

1029
00:53:12,831 --> 00:53:13,343
This is a very faint

1030
00:53:14,879 --> 00:53:17,183
Guy named Charles Burns

1031
00:53:17,439 --> 00:53:17,951
No

1032
00:53:19,231 --> 00:53:20,255
From 1761

1033
00:53:20,511 --> 00:53:26,143
To 1783

1034
00:53:26,399 --> 00:53:26,911
1 ft tall

1035
00:53:27,423 --> 00:53:28,959
The picture of the Carrie plays on the

1036
00:53:29,215 --> 00:53:31,263
Show you can find

1037
00:53:32,287 --> 00:53:33,055
The only reason

1038
00:53:33,311 --> 00:53:33,823
But this guy looks

1039
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:34,591
Much bigger than

1040
00:53:35,871 --> 00:53:37,663
Is because they have it next to a smaller

1041
00:53:38,687 --> 00:53:44,063
So the perspective of it makes it look like he is like

1042
00:53:44,575 --> 00:53:49,183
It's forced perspective he's closer to the camera than the other Scout

1043
00:53:49,439 --> 00:53:52,767
Got everything is known about this guy like it's not like he's a mystery

1044
00:53:53,023 --> 00:53:53,535
2

1045
00:53:53,791 --> 00:53:56,095
History

1046
00:53:56,607 --> 00:53:57,119
Come from

1047
00:53:57,631 --> 00:53:58,655
People know about who yet

1048
00:53:58,911 --> 00:54:00,447
And one of the really sad things is that

1049
00:54:00,703 --> 00:54:03,007
So you made it very clear during his life that he died

1050
00:54:03,263 --> 00:54:04,287
If you wanted to be buried at

1051
00:54:04,799 --> 00:54:06,335
Do you want to be sent to the ocean

1052
00:54:06,591 --> 00:54:07,103
And

1053
00:54:07,359 --> 00:54:07,871
Against

1054
00:54:08,127 --> 00:54:08,639
His wishes

1055
00:54:08,895 --> 00:54:10,943
People have put him on display

1056
00:54:11,199 --> 00:54:12,479
Epic Museum

1057
00:54:12,735 --> 00:54:14,783
Honda place over the years people have

1058
00:54:15,295 --> 00:54:15,807
Bentley tried

1059
00:54:16,319 --> 00:54:17,599
To like start movement

1060
00:54:17,855 --> 00:54:19,135
To honor his wishes

1061
00:54:19,391 --> 00:54:20,159
Posthumously

1062
00:54:20,415 --> 00:54:24,511
And they've generally gotten like pretty good public support but somehow they've not

1063
00:54:24,767 --> 00:54:27,327
To this day not to follow through and actually sent him

1064
00:54:27,583 --> 00:54:30,399
Into the water

1065
00:54:33,727 --> 00:54:35,007
You wouldn't like

1066
00:54:35,263 --> 00:54:40,639
If you told him when he was dying we're totally going to bury you at Sea and he felt better and then he died

1067
00:54:40,895 --> 00:54:42,175
And then you showed a skeleton around

1068
00:54:42,431 --> 00:54:43,199
I'm fine with that

1069
00:54:43,455 --> 00:54:47,807
I don't really care he's terrible

1070
00:54:48,063 --> 00:54:48,831
That's a good point

1071
00:54:49,087 --> 00:54:49,599
Fair enough

1072
00:54:49,855 --> 00:54:52,927
In the world of Project Camelot

1073
00:54:53,183 --> 00:54:53,695
His venture

1074
00:54:53,951 --> 00:54:59,583
Probably not very happy

1075
00:54:59,839 --> 00:55:00,351
You've been on

1076
00:55:01,887 --> 00:55:07,007
I've turned into an Anunnaki people like every catheter coming in and taking stupid

1077
00:55:07,263 --> 00:55:12,127
Pictures of them putting the real world

1078
00:55:12,383 --> 00:55:13,919
If you if I was dying

1079
00:55:14,175 --> 00:55:15,455
And I was like my last wish

1080
00:55:15,711 --> 00:55:16,223
Is

1081
00:55:16,479 --> 00:55:16,991
Don't

1082
00:55:17,247 --> 00:55:18,271
Remove my feet

1083
00:55:18,783 --> 00:55:20,575
And then attach them to my skull

1084
00:55:20,831 --> 00:55:21,343
With

1085
00:55:21,599 --> 00:55:23,135
Screws where my ears War

1086
00:55:24,415 --> 00:55:25,695
Exactly

1087
00:55:25,951 --> 00:55:27,487
Then you just said to me

1088
00:55:27,999 --> 00:55:29,279
We will never do that

1089
00:55:29,791 --> 00:55:31,327
And then after I died you did that

1090
00:55:31,839 --> 00:55:32,351
I don't care

1091
00:55:32,607 --> 00:55:35,167
I'm already dead who gives a f*** I know that

1092
00:55:35,423 --> 00:55:36,191
You can't care

1093
00:55:36,447 --> 00:55:37,727
But I don't actually think it's

1094
00:55:37,983 --> 00:55:38,495
For the person

1095
00:55:38,751 --> 00:55:40,031
Who died I think it's for the

1096
00:55:40,287 --> 00:55:41,311
Communal Mental Health

1097
00:55:41,823 --> 00:55:43,615
I think it there's some sort of comfort

1098
00:55:43,871 --> 00:55:46,687
That we can get in terms of feeling like we are helping

1099
00:55:46,943 --> 00:55:47,967
Honor the wishes of the

1100
00:55:48,991 --> 00:55:50,527
That's why you have a wake

1101
00:55:50,783 --> 00:55:53,343
That's why you bury people it's bad for the dead person

1102
00:55:53,599 --> 00:55:54,879
For the community

1103
00:55:55,135 --> 00:55:56,927
To heal and come together and stuff like that

1104
00:55:57,183 --> 00:55:59,487
So the idea of you not wanting your feet

1105
00:55:59,743 --> 00:56:00,767
Need to be used in ears

1106
00:56:03,071 --> 00:56:08,703
Whatever dude I think you're in the clear their butt

1107
00:56:08,959 --> 00:56:15,103
I feel like that would make the community feel even better

1108
00:56:15,359 --> 00:56:17,151
My ear hole

1109
00:56:17,407 --> 00:56:19,199
That's about

1110
00:56:19,711 --> 00:56:20,991
Thanks

1111
00:56:21,503 --> 00:56:24,063
Don't care necessarily about your soul being if

1112
00:56:24,319 --> 00:56:27,135
When I screw your ears onto your

1113
00:56:27,391 --> 00:56:29,951
It's more about knowing that we are apart of

1114
00:56:30,719 --> 00:56:31,487
The grand

1115
00:56:31,743 --> 00:56:33,535
Write it something like that

1116
00:56:33,791 --> 00:56:35,839
It makes the people honoring the wish feel better

1117
00:56:36,351 --> 00:56:36,863
The value to that

1118
00:56:37,119 --> 00:56:38,911
I respect the position

1119
00:56:39,423 --> 00:56:41,983
I don't think that's anything mysterious or Ghostly

1120
00:56:42,495 --> 00:56:43,519
Just about

1121
00:56:43,775 --> 00:56:44,287
Just about

1122
00:56:44,543 --> 00:56:46,335
All of us feeling good as a community

1123
00:56:46,591 --> 00:56:49,919
You like to imagine that your wishes will be followed when your dad

1124
00:56:50,175 --> 00:56:53,247
Whatever some people will have feelings

1125
00:56:53,759 --> 00:56:59,903
Just because you don't doesn't mean that I should respect that position

1126
00:57:00,159 --> 00:57:01,439
Was going to say

1127
00:57:01,695 --> 00:57:02,463
Plus it also helps

1128
00:57:02,719 --> 00:57:03,231
The community,

1129
00:57:03,487 --> 00:57:04,767
Come to terms of mortality better

1130
00:57:05,023 --> 00:57:06,047
Because it's like I will want

1131
00:57:06,303 --> 00:57:08,351
One day I will be in the position of

1132
00:57:08,607 --> 00:57:09,119
This corpse

1133
00:57:10,399 --> 00:57:11,423
Respect in honoring

1134
00:57:11,679 --> 00:57:12,191
The living

1135
00:57:12,447 --> 00:57:12,959
Person who

1136
00:57:16,543 --> 00:57:17,055
The value to it

1137
00:57:19,615 --> 00:57:21,151
One day I will be in that position

1138
00:57:21,919 --> 00:57:23,455
And so far I have not

1139
00:57:23,967 --> 00:57:24,735
Any skeletons

1140
00:57:24,991 --> 00:57:25,759
Things with their feet

1141
00:57:26,015 --> 00:57:27,807
Screw into their skulls right

1142
00:57:29,855 --> 00:57:31,903
It constantly make me feel bad not

1143
00:57:32,927 --> 00:57:39,071
This is not healing the community at all this is her I don't follow the personal affront I don't follow

1144
00:57:39,327 --> 00:57:41,631
No pit stops

1145
00:57:41,887 --> 00:57:42,399
Tyga

1146
00:57:42,655 --> 00:57:44,959
Okay alright

1147
00:57:45,215 --> 00:57:46,239
Carrie's got something

1148
00:57:49,311 --> 00:57:49,823
You're asked me if I

1149
00:57:50,079 --> 00:57:55,455
Iceland have it's delightful You've Been to Spain

1150
00:57:55,711 --> 00:57:59,295
I've Never Been to Spain I want to go

1151
00:57:59,807 --> 00:58:01,087
This next clip makes me laugh

1152
00:58:05,439 --> 00:58:07,999
Place that things often disappear there

1153
00:58:08,511 --> 00:58:11,327
And it's one of those places on Earth without happen

1154
00:58:12,095 --> 00:58:12,863
He said

1155
00:58:14,143 --> 00:58:17,215
Basically that means there's some kind of dimensional

1156
00:58:19,519 --> 00:58:20,031
I think Mark

1157
00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:25,663
I think Marc Maron displaced something instead

1158
00:58:25,919 --> 00:58:29,759
Babies like goddamn everything

1159
00:58:30,015 --> 00:58:31,807
Something like that needs just trying to work

1160
00:58:32,575 --> 00:58:36,415
Everybody knows you lose one sock in the dryer from time to time

1161
00:58:36,671 --> 00:58:41,023
Spanx that's where they go

1162
00:58:42,559 --> 00:58:48,191
The best tourism advertisement

1163
00:58:48,447 --> 00:58:48,959
OSHA

1164
00:58:49,215 --> 00:58:53,055
Let's go see what this could be magical

1165
00:58:58,687 --> 00:59:01,247
Little bit of a shorter episode than usual

1166
00:59:01,503 --> 00:59:03,551
I think it's good for everybody

1167
00:59:04,063 --> 00:59:05,343
Especially awesome

1168
00:59:05,855 --> 00:59:06,367
But

1169
00:59:06,879 --> 00:59:07,391
Jordan

1170
00:59:08,671 --> 00:59:10,463
I think I solved the mystery of Mark

1171
00:59:13,023 --> 00:59:13,535
I hate to break

1172
00:59:15,071 --> 00:59:15,583
He isn't

1173
00:59:16,351 --> 00:59:16,863
Maybe not

1174
00:59:17,375 --> 00:59:17,887
What

1175
00:59:18,143 --> 00:59:19,935
I found one

1176
00:59:20,191 --> 00:59:25,567
I found one in this next clip I found

1177
00:59:25,823 --> 00:59:27,615
V1 way story

1178
00:59:28,127 --> 00:59:28,639
Checks out

1179
00:59:29,663 --> 00:59:30,175
Eric.

1180
00:59:30,687 --> 00:59:31,199
But

1181
00:59:31,455 --> 00:59:32,991
This

1182
00:59:34,527 --> 00:59:37,343
Quit giving me some sort of plausible deniability

1183
00:59:39,135 --> 00:59:41,695
I'm not certain

1184
00:59:41,951 --> 00:59:42,463
I answered

1185
00:59:44,767 --> 00:59:46,815
He said there yes

1186
00:59:47,071 --> 00:59:51,167
She says there are multiple realities alternative Earth

1187
00:59:51,423 --> 00:59:52,959
Parallel Earth

1188
00:59:53,215 --> 00:59:55,263
As well as multiple timeline

1189
00:59:55,519 --> 00:59:56,287
That he is aware

1190
00:59:57,567 --> 00:59:58,079
He says

1191
00:59:58,335 --> 00:59:59,615
Said he thinks perhaps

1192
01:00:00,383 --> 01:00:03,967
As far as this timeline that he may have actually landed in the wrong

1193
01:00:06,527 --> 01:00:07,039
1

1194
01:00:07,551 --> 01:00:08,575
Okay alright

1195
01:00:08,831 --> 01:00:13,439
That's the only way to Storyworks you know what I buy that 150

1196
01:00:13,695 --> 01:00:14,207
Because

1197
01:00:14,463 --> 01:00:15,231
On this Earth

1198
01:00:15,999 --> 01:00:18,559
You committed

1199
01:00:22,143 --> 01:00:23,935
If you aren't that guy

1200
01:00:24,191 --> 01:00:25,727
From this timeline where is that

1201
01:00:26,751 --> 01:00:32,895
Did you merge with that guy flying around with Minerva

1202
01:00:33,151 --> 01:00:36,223
And then they switched timeline

1203
01:00:42,879 --> 01:00:44,415
Schnauzer murderer Mike Richards

1204
01:00:44,927 --> 01:00:46,207
Is MBI

1205
01:00:46,719 --> 01:00:49,023
The secret space program guys timeline

1206
01:00:49,535 --> 01:00:55,679
And he's stuck here doing the time the greatest movie ever made

1207
01:00:58,239 --> 01:01:03,359
Because I don't believe anything he says I know that this is just like a really convenient way to get out of any

1208
01:01:03,615 --> 01:01:04,127
Kind of ink

1209
01:01:05,919 --> 01:01:06,943
Yeah

1210
01:01:07,711 --> 01:01:10,527
It's the next the next best way to tell the story

1211
01:01:10,783 --> 01:01:11,551
Disregarding

1212
01:01:11,807 --> 01:01:12,575
Mike Richards

1213
01:01:12,831 --> 01:01:13,343
Entirely

1214
01:01:16,159 --> 01:01:17,183
How do you feel about the most

1215
01:01:18,463 --> 01:01:18,975
I'm fine with it

1216
01:01:19,743 --> 01:01:20,255
Okay

1217
01:01:21,023 --> 01:01:22,303
That was an interesting Road

1218
01:01:25,887 --> 01:01:27,423
No I mean I don't know what

1219
01:01:27,935 --> 01:01:30,751
What are you what are you think

1220
01:01:31,519 --> 01:01:34,079
Like as far as as far as multiple universes

1221
01:01:34,335 --> 01:01:38,943
Is godtfred far as like

1222
01:01:39,455 --> 01:01:39,967
Principals go

1223
01:01:40,223 --> 01:01:42,783
Do you accept the premise

1224
01:01:43,039 --> 01:01:44,575
But there are multiple use they're almost

1225
01:01:45,087 --> 01:01:45,599
Timeline

1226
01:01:45,855 --> 01:01:46,367
And they are

1227
01:01:46,623 --> 01:01:47,647
Every

1228
01:01:48,671 --> 01:01:49,183
Make sauce

1229
01:01:49,695 --> 01:01:50,463
Branching paths

1230
01:01:51,743 --> 01:01:54,559
I don't know yeah I believe it but I don't think it is

1231
01:01:54,815 --> 01:01:56,095
Any utility to my life

1232
01:01:56,351 --> 01:01:58,143
You know like I don't think the travel between

1233
01:01:59,679 --> 01:02:00,447
Sing like that

1234
01:02:00,703 --> 01:02:01,727
I I would be willing to

1235
01:02:04,031 --> 01:02:04,543
Know what life

1236
01:02:05,311 --> 01:02:07,871
I'm sitting here with you and

1237
01:02:08,127 --> 01:02:10,175
It's very weird that we're in physical bodies

1238
01:02:10,431 --> 01:02:11,199
Able to speak

1239
01:02:11,967 --> 01:02:12,735
Light

1240
01:02:13,247 --> 01:02:13,759
Houses

1241
01:02:14,015 --> 01:02:16,575
A liquid that we need to stay alive

1242
01:02:16,831 --> 01:02:19,135
All of us have Curiosities the guide us

1243
01:02:19,391 --> 01:02:20,159
Through

1244
01:02:20,415 --> 01:02:21,951
Passions in life Hobbies

1245
01:02:22,207 --> 01:02:27,583
Career choices along with so many cultural tradition

1246
01:02:27,839 --> 01:02:28,607
Because they happened

1247
01:02:29,119 --> 01:02:31,935
Long before any of us were alive and Everett

1248
01:02:32,959 --> 01:02:33,983
So we value money

1249
01:02:34,239 --> 01:02:37,055
Adult

1250
01:02:37,311 --> 01:02:40,127
Just trying to gather up money in order to get resources

1251
01:02:40,383 --> 01:02:41,919
Seems like a really silly game

1252
01:02:42,175 --> 01:02:43,967
That we play but we do anyway

1253
01:02:44,223 --> 01:02:47,551
I'm looking at my hand I know to my hand is a part of my body

1254
01:02:47,807 --> 01:02:48,831
F***** up very weird

1255
01:02:49,087 --> 01:02:50,879
Multiverse

1256
01:02:51,135 --> 01:02:51,647
Very weird

1257
01:02:51,903 --> 01:02:52,671
Freedom help me

1258
01:02:52,927 --> 01:02:53,695
It also doesn't help me

1259
01:02:54,207 --> 01:02:55,231
Sit back and think about life

1260
01:02:56,767 --> 01:02:58,815
It doesn't know why the hell are we doing

1261
01:03:01,887 --> 01:03:02,911
Comforting it away though

1262
01:03:03,167 --> 01:03:08,031
No because why the hell are we doing this is a question that can only be answered with

1263
01:03:08,287 --> 01:03:09,567
Why the hell aren't we

1264
01:03:10,847 --> 01:03:14,175
Multiverse

1265
01:03:14,431 --> 01:03:15,199
Suggest to me

1266
01:03:15,455 --> 01:03:16,479
AAA

1267
01:03:16,991 --> 01:03:18,015
Kind of calvinist

1268
01:03:18,527 --> 01:03:20,063
But you're in your time

1269
01:03:20,319 --> 01:03:23,647
Decisions don't actually matter

1270
01:03:23,903 --> 01:03:25,183
Because all of your decision

1271
01:03:25,439 --> 01:03:26,463
Are already made

1272
01:03:26,719 --> 01:03:29,791
Number of all of this

1273
01:03:30,559 --> 01:03:32,863
So it's comforting to know that

1274
01:03:33,119 --> 01:03:34,399
Regardless of what it is you

1275
01:03:34,655 --> 01:03:36,191
You choose to do or are doing

1276
01:03:36,703 --> 01:03:39,007
It has already been done and decided

1277
01:03:39,263 --> 01:03:40,799
And there's no reason to worry about

1278
01:03:41,567 --> 01:03:43,359
That doesn't comfort me it also doesn't

1279
01:03:43,615 --> 01:03:44,639
Freak me out or make

1280
01:03:44,895 --> 01:03:45,919
Nervous I would say

1281
01:03:47,711 --> 01:03:50,527
Because I don't need that to get me to why the hell not do so

1282
01:03:51,295 --> 01:03:53,599
Okay

1283
01:03:55,903 --> 01:03:58,975
You know I don't need I don't need to work around

1284
01:03:59,231 --> 01:03:59,999
Forget myself

1285
01:04:00,255 --> 01:04:00,767
Inspired to

1286
01:04:03,327 --> 01:04:04,095
No I don't know man

1287
01:04:05,631 --> 01:04:06,911
A lot of that abstract

1288
01:04:07,935 --> 01:04:08,703
Hypothetical stuff

1289
01:04:09,215 --> 01:04:11,519
I'm willing to believe any of it is

1290
01:04:11,775 --> 01:04:12,287
True

1291
01:04:12,543 --> 01:04:13,567
But I I just don't

1292
01:04:15,103 --> 01:04:17,663
Like I don't know I I imagine

1293
01:04:22,015 --> 01:04:26,111
Ballymena give me an application where I could use it in my life

1294
01:04:27,391 --> 01:04:28,671
Gladly say it matters

1295
01:04:28,927 --> 01:04:29,439
Alright

1296
01:04:30,463 --> 01:04:31,487
Here you are

1297
01:04:31,743 --> 01:04:32,511
You're at the grocery

1298
01:04:33,279 --> 01:04:34,047
You are looking

1299
01:04:34,559 --> 01:04:35,071
At fault

1300
01:04:36,607 --> 01:04:37,375
What cereal do

1301
01:04:39,167 --> 01:04:43,519
Depends on the mood I'm in.

1302
01:04:44,031 --> 01:04:46,079
Get out of here

1303
01:04:46,335 --> 01:04:47,359
Maybe Applejack

1304
01:04:50,175 --> 01:04:54,015
What

1305
01:04:54,271 --> 01:04:55,039
Applejack

1306
01:04:55,807 --> 01:04:57,343
You know what I thought about Applejack

1307
01:04:57,599 --> 01:04:58,623
Cheerios

1308
01:04:59,391 --> 01:04:59,903
Yeah

1309
01:05:00,159 --> 01:05:00,671
Honey Nut

1310
01:05:03,231 --> 01:05:06,303
I'm just saying that it's comforting to know that in reality

1311
01:05:07,583 --> 01:05:08,863
You have in fact

1312
01:05:09,119 --> 01:05:10,399
Chosen to eat all of those

1313
01:05:12,959 --> 01:05:13,471
No

1314
01:05:15,519 --> 01:05:18,079
I can't do that with a very clean

1315
01:05:18,335 --> 01:05:22,431
No fair enough because I am an actual fact

1316
01:05:22,687 --> 01:05:23,199
I haven't

1317
01:05:24,223 --> 01:05:29,087
So it's not comfort me at all

1318
01:05:29,343 --> 01:05:30,111
In actual fact

1319
01:05:30,367 --> 01:05:30,879
You have

1320
01:05:31,135 --> 01:05:33,439
It's only in your reality that you

1321
01:05:33,695 --> 01:05:34,207
You have

1322
01:05:35,231 --> 01:05:35,743
Right

1323
01:05:35,999 --> 01:05:37,279
I don't identify with

1324
01:05:37,535 --> 01:05:38,047
Myself

1325
01:05:38,303 --> 01:05:39,071
Another timeline

1326
01:05:39,327 --> 01:05:45,471
I feel like it only reinforces my belief that I am eating the cereal that I chose to know that

1327
01:05:45,727 --> 01:05:48,543
All of me has chosen all of these cereals

1328
01:05:50,335 --> 01:05:51,871
Petros in the cereals

1329
01:05:52,639 --> 01:05:54,175
Right here's what I would say to that

1330
01:05:54,431 --> 01:05:56,479
So there's a guy in Bangladesh

1331
01:05:56,735 --> 01:05:57,503
Never met

1332
01:05:58,527 --> 01:06:01,855
You have never met

1333
01:06:02,367 --> 01:06:04,159
Then we'll call him Kevin for the sake of argument

1334
01:06:04,415 --> 01:06:05,695
This guy is a stranger

1335
01:06:06,207 --> 01:06:12,351
Do you feel any interested material

1336
01:06:12,607 --> 01:06:18,751
Will you ask the question your care at all he is a complete

1337
01:06:20,799 --> 01:06:21,567
Well here's the thing

1338
01:06:24,895 --> 01:06:26,943
And then you no longer

1339
01:06:27,199 --> 01:06:28,223
You can find out what cereals

1340
01:06:28,735 --> 01:06:31,807
In the same way the mummies in different timeline

1341
01:06:32,063 --> 01:06:36,927
Complete strangers to me I've never met these all right

1342
01:06:37,183 --> 01:06:39,999
It means nothing if you are a listener

1343
01:06:41,535 --> 01:06:42,303
Named Kevin

1344
01:06:42,559 --> 01:06:44,095
Please call him

1345
01:06:44,351 --> 01:06:45,631
530

1346
01:06:46,143 --> 01:06:47,167
Neon

1347
01:06:47,935 --> 01:06:49,983
Let me know what f****** cereal eat

1348
01:06:50,239 --> 01:06:51,519
Because I am

1349
01:06:52,287 --> 01:06:53,055
Probably Lucky Charms

1350
01:06:54,591 --> 01:06:55,103
They're not allowed

1351
01:06:55,359 --> 01:06:55,871
Lucky Charms and

1352
01:06:58,431 --> 01:07:00,735
Freeze-dried marshmallows

1353
01:07:00,991 --> 01:07:02,783
All of this stuff

1354
01:07:03,295 --> 01:07:06,623
All right maybe I'm close minded but I just don't see

1355
01:07:06,879 --> 01:07:09,951
I don't see what good there is other than fun things to

1356
01:07:10,975 --> 01:07:11,487
And I'm not against

1357
01:07:12,255 --> 01:07:13,023
Because they're only funds

1358
01:07:13,535 --> 01:07:17,631
I think about like to think about Atlantis

1359
01:07:19,167 --> 01:07:20,447
But I think it lies you just choose

1360
01:07:20,959 --> 01:07:21,471
Things that you

1361
01:07:21,727 --> 01:07:24,031
What to think about that are outside of the realm of

1362
01:07:24,287 --> 01:07:25,567
Proving or outside the realm of

1363
01:07:25,823 --> 01:07:28,127
Be meaningful whatever resume

1364
01:07:28,895 --> 01:07:29,407
You go ahead and think

1365
01:07:29,663 --> 01:07:32,735
About that only becomes a problem when you try and force it on other people react

1366
01:07:32,991 --> 01:07:33,503
Actually

1367
01:07:33,759 --> 01:07:34,271
Concrete

1368
01:07:35,295 --> 01:07:39,391
You actually just undercut by saying that there's no possible way I could be

1369
01:07:40,415 --> 01:07:40,927
In what Kevin

1370
01:07:42,207 --> 01:07:42,975
Is

1371
01:07:45,279 --> 01:07:47,327
Do you ask

1372
01:07:47,583 --> 01:07:51,423
I did become interested or you going to serial Kevin from Bangladesh

1373
01:07:56,031 --> 01:07:57,311
What timing Kevin

1374
01:07:57,823 --> 01:07:58,847
Is living in Bangladesh

1375
01:08:00,639 --> 01:08:03,199
I don't know his story

1376
01:08:03,455 --> 01:08:06,271
What cereals are available

1377
01:08:06,527 --> 01:08:07,039
I don't know

1378
01:08:08,831 --> 01:08:09,599
Is very frustrating

1379
01:08:09,855 --> 01:08:10,879
And here's why

1380
01:08:11,647 --> 01:08:13,951
You have every right

1381
01:08:14,207 --> 01:08:16,511
I really not trying to just rile you up

1382
01:08:16,767 --> 01:08:22,911
I'm genuinely now interested no you're not never ask me the questions you would never ask

1383
01:08:23,423 --> 01:08:24,447
Are you interested

1384
01:08:24,703 --> 01:08:25,727
I would not be

1385
01:08:26,239 --> 01:08:32,383
Agree with your brothers I do as long as I don't

1386
01:08:32,639 --> 01:08:35,455
Think about it

1387
01:08:35,967 --> 01:08:37,759
You are not

1388
01:08:39,295 --> 01:08:43,647
Just to rile you up I promise you

1389
01:08:44,159 --> 01:08:48,767
I believe that you don't care about cereal consumption in Bangladesh

1390
01:08:56,703 --> 01:08:59,775
If anybody can find on that please

1391
01:09:00,031 --> 01:09:00,799
Send it our way

1392
01:09:01,311 --> 01:09:02,591
So Jordan to get some of his

1393
01:09:03,103 --> 01:09:09,247
Possible question

1394
01:09:09,503 --> 01:09:10,527
Answer to this

1395
01:09:10,783 --> 01:09:11,551
Change your life at all

1396
01:09:11,807 --> 01:09:14,111
Like

1397
01:09:14,623 --> 01:09:15,135
Not like

1398
01:09:15,391 --> 01:09:16,159
It doesn't matter

1399
01:09:16,415 --> 01:09:16,927
So even if

1400
01:09:17,183 --> 01:09:17,695
If you are kind

1401
01:09:17,951 --> 01:09:19,487
Curious about it all it is

1402
01:09:20,767 --> 01:09:21,279
Bangladesh

1403
01:09:21,535 --> 01:09:24,351
It doesn't mean anything towards like you and Kevin becoming closer

1404
01:09:24,863 --> 01:09:25,887
Not just that

1405
01:09:26,911 --> 01:09:29,215
It would almost certainly be disappointed

1406
01:09:29,727 --> 01:09:32,543
Undoubtedly it would be the greatest

1407
01:09:32,799 --> 01:09:36,895
Would be knowing what cereal

1408
01:09:38,431 --> 01:09:39,711
No not

1409
01:09:39,967 --> 01:09:44,063
Disappointment to find out

1410
01:09:44,319 --> 01:09:45,343
The mystery is what I'm a

1411
01:09:46,111 --> 01:09:48,415
And maybe that's why Multiverse stuff is really

1412
01:09:49,695 --> 01:09:51,231
Mystery that will never really

1413
01:09:51,743 --> 01:09:53,023
Crack into almost like

1414
01:09:53,279 --> 01:09:54,047
We never will

1415
01:09:54,815 --> 01:09:55,839
Well there's only one way to

1416
01:09:56,863 --> 01:09:58,655
We got to get markers out of prison

1417
01:09:58,911 --> 01:10:01,983
Know that

1418
01:10:02,239 --> 01:10:05,311
The proposed this scenario of the

1419
01:10:05,567 --> 01:10:06,591
Conclusion to the

1420
01:10:07,871 --> 01:10:08,895
Cat in the Box

1421
01:10:09,407 --> 01:10:11,967
You know the 50

1422
01:10:12,223 --> 01:10:14,527
Is to sit in the chair and

1423
01:10:14,783 --> 01:10:15,807
I have a gun with

1424
01:10:18,623 --> 01:10:19,135
And

1425
01:10:19,647 --> 01:10:20,415
Pull the trigger

1426
01:10:20,671 --> 01:10:21,439
Again and again and again

1427
01:10:22,463 --> 01:10:23,743
And if you continue surviving

1428
01:10:24,767 --> 01:10:26,047
You can prove yourself

1429
01:10:26,559 --> 01:10:27,839
That there is an

1430
01:10:28,095 --> 01:10:28,607
There is

1431
01:10:28,863 --> 01:10:29,887
No possibility

1432
01:10:30,399 --> 01:10:31,679
That you are not

1433
01:10:32,191 --> 01:10:34,239
Just existing in whatever Universe where you

1434
01:10:34,495 --> 01:10:35,007
You don't.

1435
01:10:37,823 --> 01:10:43,967
I know but that's because the only person you can prove it to is you put no You couldn't even to yourself

1436
01:10:44,223 --> 01:10:49,855
Because there's other rational explanation for why they didn't maybe the gun is jammed maybe there is a

1437
01:10:50,111 --> 01:10:52,415
Some sort of a failure in the mechanism of the gun

1438
01:10:52,927 --> 01:10:54,463
There's all kinds of other things

1439
01:10:54,719 --> 01:10:55,487
Could come into play

1440
01:10:55,743 --> 01:10:59,327
It's not like lost where you can't kill yourself

1441
01:10:59,583 --> 01:11:00,095
Right

1442
01:11:03,935 --> 01:11:08,799
It's alright for you I can see that

1443
01:11:14,175 --> 01:11:17,503

We talked about Alex Jones a whole f******

1454
01:11:45,151 --> 01:11:47,455
