Knowledge party.com

2
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:27,136
I have great respect for knowledge B I'm sick of them

00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:39,936
MoneyGram

4
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:56,064
Knowledge fight

5
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:05,280
Alex

6
00:01:05,536 --> 00:01:08,096
Joan Jordan

7
00:01:08,608 --> 00:01:09,120
What do you got for break

8
00:01:09,632 --> 00:01:15,776
Well I just saw that the FDA has send Alex a cease-and-desist letter about his

9
00:01:16,032 --> 00:01:19,360
Various claims products

10
00:01:20,128 --> 00:01:23,712
So in this in this in this moment when you know things look

11
00:01:24,224 --> 00:01:28,064
Weak in some ways I can take solace in

12
00:01:28,576 --> 00:01:29,856
The fact that Alex is getting

13
00:01:30,112 --> 00:01:31,904
More letters about his sales practices

14
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:32,928
Even trumps

15
00:01:33,184 --> 00:01:34,208
Fda's like weekend

16
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:35,744
We can't be doing this

17
00:01:36,256 --> 00:01:38,816
I slept nice I thought I'll take a little bit of happiness from that

18
00:01:41,632 --> 00:01:42,144
Pat's

19
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,680
I got two dogs

20
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:49,312
Play all I do with my time now is take pictures of them and keep positions and draw

21
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:55,712
You finally figured out to Twitter that's exactly how it works with Twitter is Right finally got into dog pictures

22
00:01:55,968 --> 00:02:00,576
That's how you're going to go viral

23
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:04,160
Be sure that you put a QR code on those pictures of the dogs

24
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:06,976
X2r podcast I don't know

25
00:02:07,232 --> 00:02:08,256
Maybe maybe not

26
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:10,816
I still do not understand q r

27
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:15,680
Neither do I and I never will.

28
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:21,312
Sworn on the altar of God Eternal have resistance to qr-code understanding

29
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:22,080
Qrn

30
00:02:22,336 --> 00:02:23,872
Thomas Jefferson

31
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:28,736
So Jordan to go to next episode to go over going over April 8th

32
00:02:28,992 --> 00:02:35,136
20/20 abandoned Appliance asking you to bring it back I'm going back and forth

33
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:41,792
So today I agree this is a really hotly-anticipated episode because this is Wednesday of this week

34
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:43,584
Damned if you'll recall

35
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:47,168
Back on April 1st Wednesday of last week

36
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:52,544
Alex got really pissy but however unlike qanon and no one likes him course and so he decided

37
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:58,944
To make a threat on air that he was going to reveal qanon side entity is they did not reveal themselves

38
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:04,576
It Is by April 8th and he's going to do it today you made it very clear that they had until Tuesday

39
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,672
Wednesday

40
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:11,232
So here is I'm saying that back on the 1st

41
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:12,512
You know what

42
00:03:13,024 --> 00:03:13,792
I'll just exposed

43
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:16,096
Deadline

44
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:24,288
It all

45
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:30,944
Documents

46
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:43,488
The based on that

47
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:49,120
This is real this is not talk I exactly

48
00:03:49,632 --> 00:03:51,680
The literal definitions of those words

49
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:53,728
Require

50
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:58,848
I would say that maybe you could look at this in hindsight as an April Fool's Day prank

51
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:03,712
If he pulled that'll be so bad

52
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:06,016
This episode

53
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:11,392
This is not going to be a long episode this is a really bad episode of Alex's show and we'll discuss

54
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:13,952
You know the will he won't he

55
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:24,447
I'm trying to play a little game here where I'm like not going to just tell you right up front that he doesn't reveal

56
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:28,031
I did

57
00:04:28,287 --> 00:04:33,663
Don't worry we'll discuss some of this before it gets out of business we could take a little moment say thank you some folk to sign up for supporting the show

Infowars

76
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:47,903

77
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:50,207
Local charity in her area and sports

We would love it

79
00:05:51,487 --> 00:05:51,999
If you did I

80
00:05:52,255 --> 00:05:56,351
There you go

81
00:05:56,863 --> 00:05:58,655
Not baby maybe surprising

82
00:05:58,911 --> 00:06:01,215
Maybe unsurprisingly talkin

83
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:04,031
Not about the identity of qanon

84
00:06:04,287 --> 00:06:08,383
Not at all it's more about Xenon that's zinc

85
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:12,991
Trump is come out and he has

86
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:14,527
Mentioned zinc

87
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:18,111
In his press conference

88
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:20,671
But I know Alex is going Buckwild on this

89
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:21,695
You pretending

90
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:25,023
He got kicked off of the Google app

91
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:27,071
Store the Android apps

92
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:30,655
Because he was like

93
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:32,191
Tonic water

94
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:38,847
Prescribed hydroxychloroquine

95
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:41,919
Scription version of quinine

96
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:44,735
We're giving our patients

97
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:47,551
Canada Dry tonic water

98
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:52,159
Off of the Google app

99
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:54,975
They said specifically for that

100
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:56,767
Hydroxychloroquine

101
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:02,655
I'm just telling you you don't have to

102
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:07,263
If you don't have a oxygen you died about 4 minutes everybody knows that

103
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:08,799
Everybody know

104
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:12,127
Astro

105
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:16,479
Foods are so

106
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:17,759
Damn empty

107
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:20,063
12 Oaks

108
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:22,623
Get your vitamin D3 yes get your sink

109
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:26,719
All your multivitamin

110
00:07:27,231 --> 00:07:28,511
Non-synthetic

111
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:30,047
Absolutely

112
00:07:33,631 --> 00:07:35,679
He had the real red pill red pill Plus

113
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:37,727
Wow

114
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:39,263
For adults

115
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:48,735
I don't know what it is

116
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:53,087
When I do this showed the preparation of the show there's like

117
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:59,743
There are different kind of feelings that I have and a lot of the time I can really indulge in and enjoy Alex's

118
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:00,511
Stupidity and

119
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:01,535
And all this

120
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:03,583
I don't know why but today I could not

121
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:07,679
I could I am sick of the bulshit I am not interested

122
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:13,567
I just listening to them do that over and over again basically really frustrated

123
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:16,895
Partially because he's supposed to be revealed who qanon is

124
00:08:19,967 --> 00:08:22,271
Let me out but he's not doing that

125
00:08:22,783 --> 00:08:25,343
F****** rambling about the zinc in his real red pill

126
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:26,879
Hawkeye this is just

127
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:27,647
It's not what I want

128
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:29,695
Exhausting

129
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:33,279
It is tired of it

130
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:37,119
Yeah you give up

131
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:39,167
Going to stop

132
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:45,567
You really excited like a threat to reveal qanon

133
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:47,359
Following days

134
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:48,383
Just like

135
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:55,807
Propaganda narratives that he's ripped off from Jordan sather and other qanon

136
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:57,087
Do his big reveal with

137
00:08:57,343 --> 00:08:59,135
What the f*** you even doing man

138
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:00,159
Is this

139
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:01,695
God just opened

140
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:02,975
Potential

141
00:09:03,487 --> 00:09:05,791
Did the keys know released

142
00:09:06,047 --> 00:09:08,863
Thank you for 3 years

143
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:10,911
Very frustrated

144
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:16,543
So Alex has been kicked off all these social media things and all this

145
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:17,311
Big Tech

146
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:18,847
There are there censoring him

147
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:20,383
Course

148
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:21,663
You should be afraid of them

149
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:23,967
All obviously but you're not

150
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:25,759
Because they look like hippies

151
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:26,527
Okay

152
00:09:26,783 --> 00:09:27,551
If they were suits

153
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:29,343
Scooby scared of them

154
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:33,951
And then Alex gets a little bit so I don't know homophobic against him

155
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:38,815
Different colored socks

156
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:40,863
Burning man that's they're sick

157
00:09:42,143 --> 00:09:42,911
They were wearing

158
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:46,239
Hugo Boss in a Nazi uniform he be scared

159
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,567
Professional-looking

160
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:50,591
You just let him

161
00:09:50,847 --> 00:09:51,871
Wraparound

162
00:09:52,127 --> 00:09:52,639
You know because

163
00:10:00,575 --> 00:10:01,855
You can be both

164
00:10:02,367 --> 00:10:03,647
Tearing around

165
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:09,535
I think it's a little bit of a gross thing or the end I really only kept I clip around because of the

166
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:11,839
The obsession videos with people wearing two different

167
00:10:12,095 --> 00:10:12,863
Colored socks

168
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:13,887
That comes up

169
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:15,679
So I don't understand it

170
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:20,543
He's just got that you weirdos with your different colored socks

171
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:26,175
That is like his mom written all over it like when he was but he yells mom-to-be

172
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:28,223
What the right Fox

173
00:10:29,503 --> 00:10:30,015
Mama

174
00:10:31,807 --> 00:10:36,927
Sounds like actual personal story behind the colored socks thing probably

175
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:38,463
It's very

176
00:10:38,975 --> 00:10:41,791
Very mysterious

177
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:43,583
Situation

178
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:47,935
So Alex has some graphs that he's he's touting

179
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:52,543
But he purports to say show that this virus at the whole situation

180
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:54,079
It's basically a hoax

181
00:10:54,591 --> 00:10:56,895
That's because he's pushing this as largely a

182
00:10:57,151 --> 00:10:58,175
Malnutrition

183
00:10:58,431 --> 00:11:00,479
Situation now

184
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:02,527
Because we're selling

185
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:09,695
False

186
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:11,231
But here's the paradox

187
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:18,655
You're saying Alex you just said that this this thing is a hoax and used to take our Liberty but you're saying a virus is real yes

188
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:22,239
Millions and millions die a year from now depression

189
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:24,287
Regular flu

190
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:27,103
Malnutrition is a giant issue

191
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:30,175
We talked about it here with Mike Adams

192
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:36,319
The answer is

193
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:39,391
How do you get sick

194
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:40,671
But it's still dangerous

195
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:46,047
Alex has been saying that a lot lately and I will say that he was to say stuff like that a lot more

196
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:51,167
Back when youngevity and dr. Wallach where his main sponsor

197
00:11:51,423 --> 00:11:53,727
He certainly said that's her to stuff a lot

198
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:56,543
More back then

199
00:11:57,055 --> 00:12:00,895
Hasn't been his number one concern for a while now outside

200
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:03,711
Yeah it's his belief

201
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:08,319
Basically is that you know you're seeing the number is going down

202
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:09,343
Perhaps be flattened

203
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:11,391
The curve is is underway

204
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:14,207
And Alex believes

205
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:16,767
He's found a quote

206
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:18,047
From Dr birx

207
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:19,071
About

208
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:21,631
Them taking people who have

209
00:12:22,143 --> 00:12:23,167
Tested positive

210
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:24,191
Who died

211
00:12:24,447 --> 00:12:27,007
Included as covid-19 deaths

212
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:28,031
Yes

213
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:31,103
And then of course you know there's an autopsy

214
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:34,175
And it's determined whether or not they actually died

215
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:36,735
From complication condition

216
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:38,271
Or bullet wound

217
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:39,039
Could have been cover

218
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:40,575
You'll never know the

219
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:44,671
It's not ever that but that's what I would say

220
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:45,951
Exactly and so he's

221
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:47,743
Determined

222
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:49,535
Context

223
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:55,935
But he's read that they're just saying anybody who has a cold is now covid-19

224
00:12:56,191 --> 00:12:57,215
Numbers

225
00:12:57,471 --> 00:13:00,031
And so they're they're making fake numbers

226
00:13:00,543 --> 00:13:03,359
That's basically where he's at it's very boring

227
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:04,639
It's fun to me

228
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:10,527
That that ability to just like wave away a very reasonable criticism with lies like

229
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:12,063
He's like now

230
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:13,087
You're thinking

231
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:15,135
How is it that you can call it a hoax

232
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:17,183
And then one second later say the virus

233
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:18,463
Is real well

234
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:21,279
Here's some b******* that doesn't answer that question

235
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:25,375
Know that still doesn't answer the phone

236
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:27,679
Get some zinc

237
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:30,751
You can't just bring up like here's why

238
00:13:31,263 --> 00:13:32,287
Captain Kirk

239
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:33,823
Not going to happen

240
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:34,847
You answer the question

241
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:38,687
We see the numbers are going down

242
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:39,967
Sort of

243
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:40,991
I guess

244
00:13:41,247 --> 00:13:46,111
And Alex has an explanation for this video has absolutely no basis in the inmate

245
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:50,463
Are you get sick

246
00:13:54,047 --> 00:13:56,095
People have bought it off the shelves everywhere

247
00:13:58,399 --> 00:13:59,935
Why the numbers going down

248
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:01,471
McLeod

249
00:14:05,823 --> 00:14:11,967
So there's your private messages you're texting about chloroquine the AI I'll shut you down or something

250
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:18,879
But yeah so apparently everyone's gone out to the store and bought this directly chloroquine and that's why

251
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:22,719
Numbers are still illegal

252
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:29,119
It's iffy might be getting another letter

253
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:32,959
Somebody saying that if you have it it'll help that

254
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:33,727
Cargo depth

255
00:14:33,983 --> 00:14:35,775
I'm still going to go with us

256
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:40,383
It's not the it's not the kind of thing I would like to see out of him

257
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:43,711
So he's pretty mad about the New York Times

258
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:47,295
Because they have recently put out

259
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:48,575
An article that

260
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:49,599
Discusses

261
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:51,391
A little bit of a financial stake

262
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:52,159
Drum pad

263
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:56,767
In a company that produces hydroxychloroquine

264
00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:01,119
Well I mean I think he's probably more mad at other

265
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:01,887
Peoples

266
00:15:02,143 --> 00:15:06,495
Tweets about the article than the article itself would assume that

267
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:08,031
Cuz here's his take on

268
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:10,847
I'll show you the New York Times

269
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:11,615
Trump

270
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:13,663
Pushing hydroxychloroquine

271
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:15,711
Money they went and looked at

272
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:18,783
Folio he had and he had

273
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:20,575
Less than four

274
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:23,135
$100 at the peak of the stock market

275
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:24,927
$135 at the low

276
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:26,207
$29 oh yeah

277
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:31,583
Evil Base John

278
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:37,471
Did report on a small investment that Trump has in his funds

279
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:40,031
Not even a direct investment

280
00:15:40,287 --> 00:15:41,823
These funds

281
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:44,383
Invest in a company called Santa Fe

282
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:46,943
Which produces Plaquenil

283
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:49,247
Does the brand name of hydroxychloroquine

284
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:55,135
I don't think that most of the reporting surrounding this suggested that it was his motivation for touting it as a miracle cure

285
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:56,671
I think that's probably just

286
00:15:56,927 --> 00:16:03,071
Sweets that Alex is off but I think it's understandable for people to have that reaction on Twitter like Trump is corrupt as hell

287
00:16:03,327 --> 00:16:05,631
So what do you have the appearance of impropriety

288
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:06,911
It's going to give people like

289
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:08,703
If you are going to give him the benefit of the doubt

290
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:10,239
Yeah where am I

291
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:12,287
Like five or six Senators now who have

292
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:15,103
Committed up very obvious Crimes by taking

293
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:17,919
Secret information and using it to make money

294
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:21,759
That seems like now is a good time to remove all better for

295
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:22,783
For the doubt for election

296
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:23,807
Officials announce

297
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:24,575
Stealing money

298
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:25,599
Sure

299
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:27,391
Yeah it's

300
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:29,439
It's a mess and I understand

301
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:30,207
Like

302
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:34,047
You know there is there was also the article that

303
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:35,839
It was about how like Michael Cohen

304
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:40,447
It gotten some money Trump's lawyer got robbed money guy

305
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:47,103
The other copy of Novartis but like I still don't think that even the articles that I read about that were

306
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:50,175
Saying like this is why he's behaving this way

307
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:51,199
This is

308
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:53,759
This is why you can't have someone like this be present

309
00:16:54,015 --> 00:16:54,527
Exactly

310
00:16:54,783 --> 00:16:58,111
Cuz the appearance of impropriety is here

311
00:16:58,623 --> 00:17:04,767
All questions and all like all things are up for grabs it's hard to deduce what the

312
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:08,351
Reality is it be like if Jimmy Carter

313
00:17:08,607 --> 00:17:11,679
Kept his Peanut Farm and then using his powers president

314
00:17:11,935 --> 00:17:16,543
Raise the price of peanuts by 10 million percent

315
00:17:17,823 --> 00:17:19,103
Planners

316
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:23,711
New York Times They don't want you to have

317
00:17:23,967 --> 00:17:25,759
Chloroquine right there are attacking

318
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:27,551
The idea of having a

319
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:32,671
Just wants to push it on you cuz he has Financial intra

320
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:34,975
But the reality is man

321
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:36,255
They're all taken it

322
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:38,303
They're all taken

323
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:46,751
Are there making sure you

324
00:17:47,007 --> 00:17:53,151
Don't get it because they want my dad's for the economy

325
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:53,919
Inoculation

326
00:17:56,223 --> 00:17:57,759
It's all official

327
00:17:58,015 --> 00:17:59,807
When do they make it official I don't know

328
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:06,207
Alex tested every one of the New York Times or hydroxychloroquine

329
00:18:06,463 --> 00:18:06,975
Then who qanon

330
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:12,095
I don't know if I don't know how this is all officials but

331
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:13,375
Entire staff

332
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:14,143
Set the New York.

333
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:19,775
It's just I don't know what it is they're just something about how I'm feeling

334
00:18:20,287 --> 00:18:20,799
That

335
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:25,663
Like I hear stuff like this and my reaction to today's to roll my eyes

336
00:18:26,943 --> 00:18:27,455
Bagel Factory

337
00:18:27,711 --> 00:18:29,247
Yourself have fun Alex

338
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:34,367
I think that's a fine thing either I think we all need a vacation from giving a

339
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:36,415
I need to listen to him and go

340
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:37,183
Fart

341
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:42,559
Yeah it's tough for me to give myself permission to do that because I feel like it's so much like

342
00:18:42,815 --> 00:18:48,959
You know within my nature to all well let's find out if anybody at the New York Times

343
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:54,335
We don't need to do that f****** fly a kite

344
00:18:56,383 --> 00:18:57,919
Spell definitely

345
00:18:58,175 --> 00:19:04,319
I mean that makes this episode I don't even know if we're going to make it to an hour I'll just episode

346
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:10,719
Horrible episode of the show

347
00:19:11,231 --> 00:19:13,535
A large part of the beginning is just like

348
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:19,935
Hey I'm right about zinc and hydroxychloroquine it's the

349
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:20,959
Need to belabor it

350
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:22,495
Benny has two guests

351
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:26,591
One of them is a guy who just interview David Icke

352
00:19:27,103 --> 00:19:28,639
About a bunch of Coronavirus

353
00:19:28,895 --> 00:19:29,919
Conspiracy nonsense

354
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:33,759
5G makes you susceptible to at what have you

355
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:35,039
Totally

356
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:36,575
Hundred percent legit great

357
00:19:36,831 --> 00:19:40,927
Stop this guy probably had his video taken down from YouTube

358
00:19:41,183 --> 00:19:42,463
Or something along those lines

359
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:51,167
Interview where we wind together about how we're so victimized and we don't have

360
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:57,567
The show is this useless interview with a guy interview David Icke I don't care

361
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:03,455
The guy who interviewed

362
00:20:04,223 --> 00:20:09,087
A little bit like that the drunk guy at the end of the bar whose

363
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:10,879
55 years old near just like

364
00:20:11,647 --> 00:20:17,535
Hey man you seem lonely and he's like you know I almost made it to the majors once and he like off your printout

365
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:22,399
It's not into the drunk guy at the end of the bar is like I knew someone who almost made the noises

366
00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:29,055
Fieldworks story

367
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:37,247
So I don't have any clips of that interview with the guy I think it shows called like London real and I just

368
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:39,295
I died it was listening to it

369
00:20:39,551 --> 00:20:40,575
I could not I could not

370
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:41,599
Be bothered

371
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:42,367
To give a s***

372
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:44,415
I just

373
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:47,231
You know what you here's the here's the God's honest truth

374
00:20:47,743 --> 00:20:53,887
If this wasn't the episode where Alex said that he was going to reveal the identity of human body wouldn't be doing and who would

375
00:20:54,143 --> 00:20:57,983
I was listen to like her eyes

376
00:20:58,751 --> 00:21:00,543
Go on here something going here nope

377
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:02,079
Just I have

378
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:04,127
10 Clips total

379
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:08,735
You know what bugs me out

380
00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:10,783
No conspiracy theorist are stepping up

381
00:21:11,295 --> 00:21:17,440
That's what really bums me out about this whole thing is that they're all doing the same shity boring lie that Trump

382
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:18,208
Open spelling

383
00:21:18,464 --> 00:21:20,512
Nobody's really stepping up and give me

384
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:22,304
Giving me something absolutely insane

385
00:21:22,816 --> 00:21:26,400
They've been bitching about 5G forever and they just had the virus to it

386
00:21:26,656 --> 00:21:31,264
They've been bitching about big Pharma and now they just got there but they're all doing it

387
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:34,080
We got the globalists and they're doing the whole thing.

388
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:35,872
Race specific bioweapon

389
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:38,176
Replace the population with forced inoculation

390
00:21:38,432 --> 00:21:41,504
All of this is the same shift we just added the virus

391
00:21:42,272 --> 00:21:47,648
I don't know man you know what the problem is I bet that there are some really good

392
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,184
Conspiracy theory

393
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,976
Stuff going on in the open

394
00:21:51,232 --> 00:21:57,376
Mike scene in The Conspiracy open mic in the conspiracy Open Mic like weird message board you'll never be

395
00:21:57,888 --> 00:21:58,400
Deep

396
00:21:58,912 --> 00:22:00,960
Review videos on YouTube

397
00:22:01,216 --> 00:22:04,288
Flowering of alternative comedy Oliver

398
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:07,104
Receipt Erie boom and now we got the

399
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,152
The guys who are really going to work on the

400
00:22:09,408 --> 00:22:09,920
The craft of

401
00:22:10,432 --> 00:22:11,456
Yeah yeah there's

402
00:22:11,712 --> 00:22:16,832
There's something going on bubbling under the surface I'm sure but it's so inaccessible

403
00:22:17,856 --> 00:22:24,000
But you never know these Young Guns until they release the conspiracy

404
00:22:24,256 --> 00:22:25,280
Comedian conspiracy

405
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:33,472
Pretty

406
00:22:33,728 --> 00:22:36,032
We're stuck in that that sort of

407
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:38,080
Almost corporate conspiracy

408
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:41,920
Things down a little bit

409
00:22:42,176 --> 00:22:44,224
Who's giving us all a conspiracy theories now.

410
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,528
The prison of the establishment is giving us our

411
00:22:46,784 --> 00:22:47,296
Conspiracy

412
00:22:47,552 --> 00:22:50,368
Yeah we don't have anybody in the weeds you know

413
00:22:51,392 --> 00:22:57,536
Yep and all the people in the weeds are just slightly weirder versions of the same thing

414
00:22:57,792 --> 00:22:59,072
Camelot is like okay

415
00:22:59,328 --> 00:23:00,352
You believe more life

416
00:23:00,608 --> 00:23:02,400
The same thing but then there's Raptors

417
00:23:04,448 --> 00:23:05,216
Good

418
00:23:05,472 --> 00:23:09,568
That's a real bummer Alex has that guests on the London real guy

419
00:23:09,824 --> 00:23:10,848
Diane play

420
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:11,872
London fake

421
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,408
0

422
00:23:13,664 --> 00:23:14,176
0 in

423
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,480
But before that

424
00:23:16,736 --> 00:23:17,248
That was another guy

425
00:23:18,016 --> 00:23:19,296
A guy right never heard of

426
00:23:19,552 --> 00:23:21,856
Before and this guy

427
00:23:22,624 --> 00:23:23,136
Trouble

428
00:23:23,648 --> 00:23:24,160
Use problem

429
00:23:25,184 --> 00:23:27,744
He's a problem for me because

430
00:23:28,512 --> 00:23:30,560
I really have about a

431
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:35,424
50/50 feeling about even talking about him okay because I think that he's unwell

432
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,704
Oh okay

433
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:43,104
If you would someone who's on Project Camelot I wouldn't talk to him talk about

434
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:46,944
Okay okay cuz I think that there is a mental

435
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,224
Unwellness

436
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,528
To him it's not that he wears the same outfit

437
00:23:51,552 --> 00:23:52,064
It's just no

438
00:23:52,576 --> 00:23:54,880
No name is Cyrus parsa

439
00:23:56,416 --> 00:24:00,256
I was probably going to ignore a good bit of this but then this clip happened

440
00:24:00,768 --> 00:24:01,280
And I was like

441
00:24:01,792 --> 00:24:03,584
This is so like this is in our wheelhouse

442
00:24:04,096 --> 00:24:09,472
In the same way that that clip about the people wearing two colored socks this is a running gag on

443
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,032
1000

444
00:24:14,592 --> 00:24:15,104
Electric companies

445
00:24:17,408 --> 00:24:17,920
100 War

446
00:24:18,432 --> 00:24:22,272
Timeworks Chinese and over 600 World Western companies which

447
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:23,552
Comprised

448
00:24:23,808 --> 00:24:25,088
American companies

449
00:24:25,344 --> 00:24:29,440
I'm European companies and some other companies that in Japan other places

450
00:24:44,032 --> 00:24:44,800
Got my phone

451
00:24:49,664 --> 00:24:50,432
This is

452
00:24:50,688 --> 00:24:52,736
This is deserving of a cup

453
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:59,136
If you don't want me to sit here and eat a sandwich or not give a s*** that you shouldn't

454
00:24:59,392 --> 00:25:05,536
Sit here and eat a sandwich so great if there's like a guy stop stalking you

455
00:25:05,792 --> 00:25:08,864
Images cuts to like Alex the big submarine sandwich

456
00:25:12,192 --> 00:25:13,728
Surprised by the camera

457
00:25:13,984 --> 00:25:19,360
What is why do you put a giant gun on your desk every day man get a Big-Ass Sandwiches

458
00:25:19,616 --> 00:25:22,176
Just take fingerling B of its all day

459
00:25:22,432 --> 00:25:22,944
Clips

460
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,992
So f****** funny to me like

461
00:25:25,504 --> 00:25:26,272
I get it man

462
00:25:26,528 --> 00:25:30,368
You got to eat

463
00:25:31,904 --> 00:25:35,232
Commercial break

464
00:25:38,816 --> 00:25:42,144
Would you leave me to think that maybe he's constantly eating

465
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:42,912
We only

466
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:43,680
Ketchup

467
00:25:44,192 --> 00:25:47,520
How can I how can it happen so regularly during these interviews

468
00:25:47,776 --> 00:25:48,800
If it's happening every

469
00:25:49,312 --> 00:25:51,616
Has to be happy every single day

470
00:25:52,128 --> 00:25:55,456
Then why don't you do it during the commercials there's minutes during the commercial

471
00:25:55,712 --> 00:26:01,856
It's not like he's stuck on are straight for 4 hours and it's not like 4 hours is he gets on Aaron

472
00:26:02,112 --> 00:26:03,392
11th snack

473
00:26:05,184 --> 00:26:06,464
Have a nice meal or something

474
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:10,304
Kids low blood sugar in the middle of the show he's got to take a bite he's got to keep going

475
00:26:11,328 --> 00:26:13,120
Great Snickers commercial

476
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,704
Alex Jones in the middle of a rant about devils

477
00:26:17,216 --> 00:26:18,752
Snickers

478
00:26:19,264 --> 00:26:20,800
Made it starts about think

479
00:26:22,592 --> 00:26:24,128
It is Eddie's

480
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:27,200
Because you got to figure that he gets caught like what

481
00:26:27,712 --> 00:26:30,528
I mean even even if you're really bad at

482
00:26:30,784 --> 00:26:31,808
Getting caught for doing so

483
00:26:32,064 --> 00:26:32,832
Stuff you only get caught like

484
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:38,208
She got to figure he's eating all the time throughout these interviews

485
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:38,976
You think yeah

486
00:26:39,232 --> 00:26:39,744
And I think

487
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,840
My suspicion is that it is absolutely a sign of disrespect

488
00:26:44,864 --> 00:26:45,376
And it is on

489
00:26:46,144 --> 00:26:47,936
I think you really knows when I was like

490
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:49,472
You guys are done

491
00:26:49,728 --> 00:26:51,520
And I don't give a f*** if I get caught

492
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:54,336
Even if it's not intentional sign of disrespect

493
00:26:54,592 --> 00:26:55,872
It's a disrespect

494
00:26:57,152 --> 00:26:58,688
It's also disrespected the audience

495
00:26:58,944 --> 00:27:02,784
Disrespect disrespect to

496
00:27:05,856 --> 00:27:09,184
To do babe Rush Limbaugh

497
00:27:09,696 --> 00:27:14,048
Eat chips throughout his old

498
00:27:14,304 --> 00:27:14,816
Powerful

499
00:27:15,328 --> 00:27:15,840
Powerball

500
00:27:16,096 --> 00:27:17,632
The government is doing

501
00:27:18,144 --> 00:27:20,448
Yeah that's that's good

502
00:27:20,704 --> 00:27:21,216
Pennywise

503
00:27:21,472 --> 00:27:21,984
The government

504
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:25,312
So this dude

505
00:27:25,568 --> 00:27:30,176
He's what you might call like a self-styled 5G expert

506
00:27:30,432 --> 00:27:32,736
And Alex wanted him to come on talk about like

507
00:27:32,992 --> 00:27:34,272
AI take over

508
00:27:34,528 --> 00:27:39,648
But I just couldn't care and I heard that clip of Alex very clearly eating while talking to him like

509
00:27:39,904 --> 00:27:42,976
Fine I'm going to have to bring up that he's on the show

510
00:27:43,488 --> 00:27:45,024
So I lose listening to it I was like

511
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:45,792
Okay

512
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:48,864
He's just he's researched all these companies

513
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:49,888
And all this in

514
00:27:50,144 --> 00:27:50,656
You know

515
00:27:50,912 --> 00:27:51,424
Whatever

516
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:53,216
I'm not really interested in

517
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:55,264
And idea that you wrote a book about Trump

518
00:27:55,776 --> 00:27:57,056
Pain shopping

519
00:27:58,848 --> 00:28:00,896
This next flip is where I got really really worried

520
00:28:01,664 --> 00:28:03,200
About to Alex having this guy on it

521
00:28:05,248 --> 00:28:06,528
I had to wish to discuss

522
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:08,576
What's going to happen 20 years from now

523
00:28:10,624 --> 00:28:11,904
Facebook

524
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:13,184
Book the same change about our world

525
00:28:13,952 --> 00:28:14,464
Go to

526
00:28:15,232 --> 00:28:19,072
Take me seriously I had some kind of dream and the future I see

527
00:28:20,096 --> 00:28:20,864
What president

528
00:28:21,376 --> 00:28:22,912
Pick34 become

529
00:28:23,168 --> 00:28:23,680
Empower

530
00:28:24,448 --> 00:28:25,728
Civil War

531
00:28:26,752 --> 00:28:27,264
Chaos

532
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:29,312
People

533
00:28:34,176 --> 00:28:36,224
All these bad things are going to happen a lot of people

534
00:28:37,504 --> 00:28:38,528
Dream but I put it inside

535
00:28:45,952 --> 00:28:46,464
I wouldn't

536
00:28:49,792 --> 00:28:53,888
Feel like there's more

537
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,448
That's that's really troubling to me

538
00:28:56,704 --> 00:28:58,496
That's the kind of thinking

539
00:28:58,752 --> 00:28:59,520
Is

540
00:29:00,544 --> 00:29:02,848
That's not what I want an expert

541
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:09,504
Here's what I wanted my 5gx but let me tell you I'm a guy who's into lucid dreaming

542
00:29:10,016 --> 00:29:15,648
I do believe that you can't control your dreams I think there's an amazing power that lives in the subconscious or daughter

543
00:29:16,928 --> 00:29:18,208
But like a

544
00:29:18,464 --> 00:29:20,512
I still don't I don't

545
00:29:20,768 --> 00:29:21,536
I do believe

546
00:29:23,584 --> 00:29:25,888
Lucid dream fair I don't believe

547
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:32,544
I believe this is a repackage story I believe this is something that he's come up more and more recently maybe

548
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,080
Baby baby

549
00:29:34,592 --> 00:29:36,128
I don't know here's what I want

550
00:29:36,384 --> 00:29:36,896
5dx

551
00:29:38,688 --> 00:29:44,064
I have degrees and things that are unrelated but I saw Seven Years in Tibet so I think I got this under

552
00:29:45,088 --> 00:29:45,600
That was a good movie

553
00:29:46,624 --> 00:29:47,136
Music

554
00:29:47,648 --> 00:29:48,160
So

555
00:29:48,672 --> 00:29:49,696
This dude

556
00:29:49,952 --> 00:29:50,976
Like I said self-styled

557
00:29:51,488 --> 00:29:53,280
I don't know about those degrees

558
00:29:53,536 --> 00:29:55,840
He's a thing has don't know if I agree

559
00:29:56,096 --> 00:29:57,376
Or believe in any way

560
00:29:57,632 --> 00:30:00,192
That he was kicked out of school for not agreeing to

561
00:30:00,448 --> 00:30:01,984
Promote pedophilia

562
00:30:02,496 --> 00:30:04,032
I think that sounds dicey

563
00:30:04,544 --> 00:30:06,080
So interesting Leon April 2nd

564
00:30:06,336 --> 00:30:06,848
This year

565
00:30:07,104 --> 00:30:10,176
This dude Cyrus he posted an article

566
00:30:10,432 --> 00:30:15,040
On his website about Biden being involved in some kind of a bioweapon transfer to China sounds good

567
00:30:15,296 --> 00:30:16,832
That article itself is not interesting

568
00:30:17,344 --> 00:30:18,880
But what's fun is that his tweet

569
00:30:19,136 --> 00:30:19,648
Promoting the

570
00:30:19,904 --> 00:30:21,184
The post

571
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,000
You could be hashtags

572
00:30:24,256 --> 00:30:25,280
#qanon

573
00:30:25,536 --> 00:30:27,328
A hashtag Great Awakening

574
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:28,608
Which are pretty good indication

575
00:30:28,864 --> 00:30:35,008
Cyrus parsa is a big old guy

576
00:30:35,264 --> 00:30:39,104
Find it the whole way this is Alex revealing who qanon is

577
00:30:39,616 --> 00:30:40,128
Syrup

578
00:30:40,384 --> 00:30:41,152
Titius Lee

579
00:30:41,408 --> 00:30:47,552
He had to fulfill his promise growing through the dude's timeline there's a bunch of tweets these hashtags as well as Q Plus which is

580
00:30:47,808 --> 00:30:48,832
Is the qanon name for Trump

581
00:30:49,344 --> 00:30:52,416
It's so funny on this episode where Alex is supposed to

582
00:30:52,672 --> 00:30:57,792
Expose hookah wise Hampstead is interview about AI nonsense

583
00:30:58,048 --> 00:31:03,680
Also Cyrus parsa is the guy who claims to file the lawsuit against pretty much all of the villains of the extreme right

584
00:31:04,192 --> 00:31:06,240
Quote on behalf of the world's people

585
00:31:06,496 --> 00:31:10,080
On pure altruistic reasons to prevent harm to the world citizens

586
00:31:10,592 --> 00:31:11,104
Like I said

587
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:13,920
This guy has Project Camelot written all over him

588
00:31:14,176 --> 00:31:14,944
That is a really

589
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:15,712
Yeah but I'm

590
00:31:15,968 --> 00:31:16,992
That's a pure way of

591
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:20,064
He's better than the guys we normally talk

592
00:31:20,832 --> 00:31:25,184
And if it takes a little bit of crazy to get there it's better than the crazy that we deal with all day

593
00:31:25,952 --> 00:31:27,744
This is a man who's filing lawsuit

594
00:31:28,768 --> 00:31:29,280
Aristocles

595
00:31:29,536 --> 00:31:35,680
Larry klayman

596
00:31:35,936 --> 00:31:36,704
Imagine you think

597
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:39,776
Larry klayman understands what altruism

598
00:31:40,544 --> 00:31:42,592
I ain't think that this dude is

599
00:31:44,128 --> 00:31:46,688
Are you all tourism to me is giving Rochester

600
00:31:46,944 --> 00:31:47,456
Stole your computer

601
00:31:47,968 --> 00:31:49,504
I hate to say this

602
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,552
Because I don't know how it's going to sound

603
00:31:51,808 --> 00:31:53,088
But this guy

604
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:55,648
He seems out of his element

605
00:31:55,904 --> 00:31:56,416
On

606
00:31:56,672 --> 00:31:57,184
Infowars

607
00:31:57,440 --> 00:31:59,488
Like he doesn't seem like he's ready for the show

608
00:31:59,744 --> 00:32:05,120
You know what I mean a lot of people who are terrible and bad gas

609
00:32:05,376 --> 00:32:06,144
Alex has

610
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,936
Barry's Holocaust deniers and

611
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:08,704
Steve pieczenik

612
00:32:09,728 --> 00:32:10,752
Narragansett

613
00:32:11,264 --> 00:32:12,544
Same thing but

614
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:14,848
Yo he has awful people on his guests

615
00:32:15,104 --> 00:32:15,872
Presbyterian little

616
00:32:16,128 --> 00:32:17,664
Slicker not as like

617
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:19,200
Oh no

618
00:32:19,456 --> 00:32:20,992
I looked at I was listening to this on my

619
00:32:21,248 --> 00:32:22,016
Oh no

620
00:32:22,272 --> 00:32:25,856
You're on this show talking about a lucid dream that you had about Trump

621
00:32:26,112 --> 00:32:27,392
Saving the world

622
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:29,184
You're not ready

623
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:31,488
No no no no I mean

624
00:32:31,744 --> 00:32:33,024
The first big show I did is this

625
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:35,584
Stand-up I was all admit I wasn't ready for

626
00:32:36,608 --> 00:32:40,192
You know I had to either upset but I learned from that experience

627
00:32:40,704 --> 00:32:43,520
I'm sure the next time he goes on and Infowars show

628
00:32:43,776 --> 00:32:44,800
He's going to have it.

629
00:32:45,568 --> 00:32:46,080
This guy

630
00:32:46,336 --> 00:32:46,848
Is going to get it

631
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,896
Well I mean if you get Sinister and talkin

632
00:32:49,152 --> 00:32:53,504
Can do from Alex bring up your dreams

633
00:32:54,528 --> 00:32:57,856
You make us look like Project Camelot

634
00:32:58,112 --> 00:32:58,880
Life I already did that

635
00:32:59,904 --> 00:33:06,048
So lest you think that you know Alex is going to hear this guy talk about his prophecies and

636
00:33:06,304 --> 00:33:07,584
He's going to be like

637
00:33:08,096 --> 00:33:09,376
I had to go

638
00:33:09,632 --> 00:33:10,400
Nope he loves

639
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:13,472
Martha is

640
00:33:13,728 --> 00:33:15,264
Author researcher

641
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:16,544
Iceberg

642
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:18,080
Very smart guy and

643
00:33:18,336 --> 00:33:21,152
Far out his own name for him

644
00:33:26,528 --> 00:33:27,040
Man

645
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:28,064
That's a commitment

646
00:33:28,576 --> 00:33:29,344
At the committee

647
00:33:29,856 --> 00:33:32,672
Yep so I only have one more clip left

648
00:33:32,928 --> 00:33:33,440
And

649
00:33:33,696 --> 00:33:35,744
It's revealing who qanon

650
00:33:38,048 --> 00:33:41,120
It's Cyrus talkin about how we all owe Our Lives

651
00:33:41,376 --> 00:33:41,888
Insta Trump

652
00:33:42,144 --> 00:33:44,960
I don't think that's true 400,000

653
00:33:45,216 --> 00:33:45,984
The people

654
00:33:46,752 --> 00:33:49,824
Connection of disquiet alone

655
00:33:51,104 --> 00:33:51,616
China

656
00:33:52,128 --> 00:33:52,896
Middle East

657
00:33:53,152 --> 00:33:53,664
You're up

658
00:33:54,944 --> 00:33:58,272
A President Trump China would be enslaving us right now

659
00:33:59,040 --> 00:33:59,552
Wouldn't you have

660
00:33:59,808 --> 00:34:01,088
Save all your butt

661
00:34:02,624 --> 00:34:06,464
For him right now I might be half the country would be dead and maybe everyone else doobie

662
00:34:08,768 --> 00:34:11,328
Everybody including the lap you owe President Trump your life

663
00:34:11,584 --> 00:34:12,608
You better talk to him

664
00:34:15,168 --> 00:34:16,704
That sounds like an angry child

665
00:34:18,752 --> 00:34:19,264
I do agree

666
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:21,568
I do own apology the truck

667
00:34:21,824 --> 00:34:22,336
If it was

668
00:34:22,592 --> 00:34:23,616
Death or slavery

669
00:34:23,872 --> 00:34:27,200
And Trump stop that with all the other stuff I'm going to have to say sorry

670
00:34:27,968 --> 00:34:30,016
Yeah yeah he don't think it's true

671
00:34:30,272 --> 00:34:32,064
I know I would say that Cyrus is like

672
00:34:32,832 --> 00:34:35,392
Just passed the line of like where I'm comfortable making

673
00:34:35,648 --> 00:34:36,416
In front of somebody

674
00:34:36,672 --> 00:34:38,464
I hear him and I get bummed out

675
00:34:38,976 --> 00:34:40,512
I don't really enjoy

676
00:34:40,768 --> 00:34:41,536
David of

677
00:34:42,048 --> 00:34:43,584
Good that that pm

678
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:45,888
Just sounds indicative of

679
00:34:46,144 --> 00:34:46,656
Adolescent

680
00:34:46,912 --> 00:34:47,680
Processing

681
00:34:47,936 --> 00:34:49,216
I think it's almost worse

682
00:34:49,728 --> 00:34:53,056
That he is acting like that idea of him acting are

683
00:34:53,312 --> 00:34:54,592
Altruistically it's almost

684
00:34:54,848 --> 00:34:58,944
Legos Alex I get it you're trying to make money you're on your hustle bulge

685
00:34:59,200 --> 00:34:59,712
You know

686
00:34:59,968 --> 00:35:00,992
I'm going to make fun of you cuz you're

687
00:35:01,248 --> 00:35:02,272
Complete a****** liar

688
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:03,808
Right

689
00:35:04,064 --> 00:35:05,600
This guy is like OU I

690
00:35:05,856 --> 00:35:06,368
You are

691
00:35:06,624 --> 00:35:07,136
Do you really do

692
00:35:08,416 --> 00:35:08,928
That's because

693
00:35:09,184 --> 00:35:09,696
Cuz you are not all

694
00:35:11,488 --> 00:35:12,000
Where you should

695
00:35:12,768 --> 00:35:14,048
Well I don't I don't

696
00:35:14,816 --> 00:35:20,448
See this is where it gets really muddy for me is like how much of that is me over reading thing

697
00:35:20,704 --> 00:35:23,264
Yeah I can only

698
00:35:24,032 --> 00:35:27,104
A little bit tough to say but it's

699
00:35:28,128 --> 00:35:30,432
I don't believe that this dude

700
00:35:30,688 --> 00:35:32,480
Is processing reality

701
00:35:32,736 --> 00:35:33,504
Thought accurately

702
00:35:34,016 --> 00:35:37,344
Sure you have a sense of that from the things that he saying

703
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:40,672
The way he leaves from one thing to another

704
00:35:41,952 --> 00:35:42,720
I just don't

705
00:35:44,256 --> 00:35:47,840
Do not like Alex having him on his against it really bums me out

706
00:35:48,096 --> 00:35:50,656
It's the same thing with but to a lesser

707
00:35:50,912 --> 00:35:51,680
Third-degree cuz I do

708
00:35:52,192 --> 00:35:53,472
I didn't even cover that

709
00:35:53,728 --> 00:35:59,872
He had that that 12 13 year old who would just say offensive things videos

710
00:36:00,384 --> 00:36:03,200
I hate him having people like that on because I can't cover

711
00:36:03,712 --> 00:36:04,736
Right I can't

712
00:36:04,992 --> 00:36:05,504
I can't do that

713
00:36:06,016 --> 00:36:07,296
It's too nakedly exploited

714
00:36:07,808 --> 00:36:10,880
Yeah yeah I think be exploited for us

715
00:36:11,136 --> 00:36:11,648
To really

716
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:14,208
Do too much time

717
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:16,000
What's Iris at least like

718
00:36:16,768 --> 00:36:17,280
I mean

719
00:36:17,792 --> 00:36:18,816
He's at 2 degrees

720
00:36:20,864 --> 00:36:22,400
More degrees than a legend

721
00:36:22,656 --> 00:36:25,216
And I have never been kicked out of a Ph.D for any

722
00:36:25,472 --> 00:36:26,752
He's got that on me too

723
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:29,056
And if telling the truth this guy

724
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:30,080
I might be a hero

725
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:36,992
Well that case is not going to make it through the courts

726
00:36:37,248 --> 00:36:41,856
How to lucid dream in 2002 about that case failing and I got to say

727
00:36:42,368 --> 00:36:43,904
I don't know I went to Tibet to

728
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:47,232
To pray for that case to succeed Dan so we might be at cross-purposes

729
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:54,144
Fire fighting it out for that case he's not going to

730
00:36:54,400 --> 00:37:00,544
Alright okay I'm almost certain it didn't get filed and is just an imaginary thing

731
00:37:02,848 --> 00:37:03,616
I don't know man

732
00:37:03,872 --> 00:37:04,384
What's

733
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:05,152
It's just

734
00:37:09,248 --> 00:37:10,272
Can you do this show

735
00:37:11,808 --> 00:37:13,856
You got to hold on to those things that are exciting

736
00:37:14,368 --> 00:37:15,136
And Alex

737
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:19,488
When he says that he's going to reveal qanon

738
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:21,792
Hey Pocky is s*** about it

739
00:37:22,048 --> 00:37:24,864
And he says this is something real this isn't talk

740
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:25,632
Yeah

741
00:37:25,888 --> 00:37:26,912
I want to believe him

742
00:37:27,168 --> 00:37:28,192
Cuz he's an adult I know

743
00:37:28,448 --> 00:37:31,008
He's a person I know dude somebody

744
00:37:31,264 --> 00:37:35,104
Should just be able to get away with things like that like saying I'm going to do this

745
00:37:35,616 --> 00:37:36,896
Get the documents ready

746
00:37:37,152 --> 00:37:37,920
I meant not

747
00:37:38,176 --> 00:37:38,688
Do it

748
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:42,784
I don't I don't know I don't appreciate that so we come to Wednesday and

749
00:37:43,808 --> 00:37:45,088
I just I feel

750
00:37:45,344 --> 00:37:50,208
I feel like he's eating a sandwich will turn to talk to me it's just disrespectful

751
00:37:50,464 --> 00:37:54,304
And the fact that he's having this dude Bucyrus guy on who this is

752
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:56,096
Where to buy fiocchi

753
00:37:56,352 --> 00:37:57,376
Completely out of his death

754
00:37:57,632 --> 00:37:58,144
I am

755
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,704
Acuminata

756
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:01,728
It's just it's it's

757
00:38:01,984 --> 00:38:04,032
It's a level of self-parody that Alex's

758
00:38:04,288 --> 00:38:05,568
Engaged in that like

759
00:38:07,872 --> 00:38:08,896
I just

760
00:38:09,664 --> 00:38:10,944
Might just be my mood

761
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,480
I'm having a tough time enjoying it

762
00:38:14,784 --> 00:38:18,624
It is something that I want to tell him to stop right right

763
00:38:19,392 --> 00:38:20,160
I got it I got to let

764
00:38:20,416 --> 00:38:22,464
Gotta let you go buddy man

765
00:38:22,976 --> 00:38:23,744
I stopped in

766
00:38:24,768 --> 00:38:25,280
Expect

767
00:38:25,792 --> 00:38:26,304
You know

768
00:38:27,072 --> 00:38:30,912
You hope for the best from the worst people and sometimes you expect

769
00:38:31,168 --> 00:38:36,800
From the best people and that puts you in a tough situation where you're dealing with the worst people who are always giving you the worst

770
00:38:37,312 --> 00:38:37,824
True

771
00:38:38,336 --> 00:38:40,384
And I think that I put myself in the situation

772
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:41,408
2 because

773
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:42,944
I've been really

774
00:38:43,712 --> 00:38:45,760
Expecting that you wasn't going to

775
00:38:46,272 --> 00:38:48,320
Of course not do it this time

776
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:50,368
Course you are trying to and yet

777
00:38:50,624 --> 00:38:51,904
Still you got your hopes up didn't you

778
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:54,464
Well yeah yeah I've been Avenged

779
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:58,048
So did like oh here come

780
00:38:58,304 --> 00:39:00,096
The most

781
00:39:00,352 --> 00:39:03,936
Charlie Brown

782
00:39:04,448 --> 00:39:09,568
Make it seem like it was in his interest and there was like there are people that he could have

783
00:39:09,824 --> 00:39:14,432
Pointed to that exist are some names out there if you want to look into

784
00:39:14,688 --> 00:39:17,760
People believe are the people behind qanon

785
00:39:18,016 --> 00:39:20,064
Alex could have gone with any of that s*** like you could have

786
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:23,904
He could have just reported something that you can find The Daily Beast

787
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:25,952
Let me know that he needs to start a feud

788
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:26,976
He's got to start

789
00:39:27,232 --> 00:39:27,744
Refute

790
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:34,144
Like that's his that's his only real moving right that's what I thought this was going to be and that's also what work

791
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,168
Works for his best

792
00:39:35,424 --> 00:39:36,448
I know cuz he

793
00:39:36,704 --> 00:39:37,472
Maguey mix

794
00:39:37,728 --> 00:39:39,776
It is the same way that like

795
00:39:40,032 --> 00:39:40,544
You know

796
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:41,824
Wrestling gets

797
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:47,712
More eyes on the product that is a good fight you want to see these two people go out against each other

798
00:39:48,224 --> 00:39:51,808
It's the same thing Alex needs to get eyes on the product by

799
00:39:52,064 --> 00:39:52,576
Starting up

800
00:39:52,832 --> 00:39:54,624
Good good

801
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:55,392
What

802
00:39:56,672 --> 00:40:00,256
I don't want to give him advice but I say go after Turning Point USA you're not going to

803
00:40:00,512 --> 00:40:01,536
Can't beat

804
00:40:01,792 --> 00:40:03,328
Nick Fuentes

805
00:40:03,584 --> 00:40:07,168
Nick's already on that space exactly

806
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:09,216
Nick smooth

807
00:40:09,728 --> 00:40:10,752
No nickel coops

808
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:19,456
I'm not taking into account easily Nick took over the Seebeck effect

809
00:40:19,712 --> 00:40:21,504
Just thinking you know Foreman

810
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:23,040
You know he got his ass kicked

811
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:25,600
Search for a while many came back later in life anymore

812
00:40:25,856 --> 00:40:26,624
Come on man

813
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:28,672
We got to get one more big win

814
00:40:28,928 --> 00:40:30,720
From Alex and I feel like you got left

815
00:40:30,976 --> 00:40:34,816
I mean if you think about it there's like okay what are you do Steven Crowder

816
00:40:35,072 --> 00:40:40,960
No Crowder will still let Alex come on as a guest every now and again Alex needs that kind of attention

817
00:40:41,472 --> 00:40:42,240
Can't fight him

818
00:40:42,752 --> 00:40:43,520
Turning Point

819
00:40:44,032 --> 00:40:46,336
Not a terrible idea but Nick already owns that

820
00:40:47,872 --> 00:40:48,384
Trump

821
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:49,152
No good

822
00:40:49,664 --> 00:40:50,176
No

823
00:40:50,688 --> 00:40:51,200
No

824
00:40:51,456 --> 00:40:53,760
That's then you're going to get piled on by everybody

825
00:40:54,016 --> 00:40:58,880
Yeah that's a space that you can carve out you know there's so many Brave

826
00:40:59,136 --> 00:41:02,464
Never trumper's are all like trying to act like they're aloof

827
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:04,000
When they're above all of this

828
00:41:04,256 --> 00:41:05,280
Bulshit even though they

829
00:41:05,792 --> 00:41:06,816
Gleefully

830
00:41:07,072 --> 00:41:10,144
Accepted all of it in the past so long as you weren't rude

831
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,960
But Alex could be the only never Trumper

832
00:41:13,216 --> 00:41:13,984
Who is

833
00:41:14,496 --> 00:41:16,544
Furiously and violently insane

834
00:41:18,592 --> 00:41:20,640
I don't know if you'd be the only one but he certainly have

835
00:41:20,896 --> 00:41:24,480
A bit of that Marketplace

836
00:41:24,736 --> 00:41:25,760
I think you're probably right

837
00:41:26,016 --> 00:41:26,784
I think that's what he should

838
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:28,320
Do but I don't think it will now

839
00:41:28,576 --> 00:41:30,112
He's a coward and and it would

840
00:41:30,368 --> 00:41:36,512
Require like taking a real serious hit in the short-term in order to stay solvent in the long-term I know that he has

841
00:41:36,768 --> 00:41:37,792
I need to do that he can't

842
00:41:38,048 --> 00:41:38,560
Space oven neither

843
00:41:38,816 --> 00:41:43,168
Know what you want is a flashy Feud with someone that is kind of like

844
00:41:43,936 --> 00:41:45,472
Beatable

845
00:41:45,728 --> 00:41:46,240
Yeah

846
00:41:46,496 --> 00:41:49,056
And I don't think I don't think there are many options anymore

847
00:41:50,336 --> 00:41:51,104
Jordan Peterson

848
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:54,943
Disappeared right

849
00:41:55,199 --> 00:41:57,247
Gone now right now you stop means to lycon

850
00:41:57,759 --> 00:41:58,271
To put that videos

851
00:42:03,135 --> 00:42:04,671
Peabody agreements

852
00:42:04,927 --> 00:42:05,695
Yeah

853
00:42:06,207 --> 00:42:07,743
He's not friends with e Michael Jones

854
00:42:07,999 --> 00:42:08,511
So

855
00:42:08,767 --> 00:42:09,791
I can't do that

856
00:42:10,303 --> 00:42:12,351
I say I say here's what you do

857
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:13,887
Here's what you do

858
00:42:14,143 --> 00:42:15,679
You you f******

859
00:42:16,703 --> 00:42:17,215
Kiara

860
00:42:17,471 --> 00:42:20,287
Hugo Hugo the old Route and you manufacture Abby

861
00:42:20,543 --> 00:42:21,567
So he

862
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:22,591
Goes up again

863
00:42:23,103 --> 00:42:23,615
The Oath Keepers

864
00:42:24,383 --> 00:42:24,895
How about that

865
00:42:25,151 --> 00:42:31,295
Oh so they're in on it together the whole time they're playing it off of each other

866
00:42:31,551 --> 00:42:32,319
About the

867
00:42:32,575 --> 00:42:33,343
So they're so

868
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:34,879
Inline with each other

869
00:42:35,135 --> 00:42:35,647
Let's see

870
00:42:35,903 --> 00:42:36,415
What are we got

871
00:42:37,951 --> 00:42:38,719
I don't know

872
00:42:39,231 --> 00:42:44,351
Aren't isn't The Oath Keepers guy a little bit more reasonable with the hate let's not all die from covid

873
00:42:45,631 --> 00:42:51,775
I'm not sure I don't think so I remember one time where he was like

874
00:42:52,031 --> 00:42:54,079
This is all crazy but you know it's still a good idea

875
00:42:55,103 --> 00:42:58,175
I'll let you know I think that was Mike Adams who sang that for a little while

876
00:42:59,711 --> 00:43:01,503
And you can't get into a fight with Mike Adams

877
00:43:02,015 --> 00:43:02,527
No

878
00:43:03,807 --> 00:43:05,599
And David knightwood before I see I think

879
00:43:05,855 --> 00:43:08,159
I think maybe you the way you do with Palace intrigue

880
00:43:08,671 --> 00:43:10,975
Uolo here we go

881
00:43:11,231 --> 00:43:12,767
Here's what we do alright it's

882
00:43:13,023 --> 00:43:14,047
It's time to put

883
00:43:14,303 --> 00:43:16,351
Our boys over

884
00:43:17,631 --> 00:43:22,495
Yeah I think it's time to put them over the two of them have to start an on-air Feud

885
00:43:22,751 --> 00:43:24,031
At their own network

886
00:43:24,287 --> 00:43:25,823
And then charity box

887
00:43:27,615 --> 00:43:30,431
I could see them getting that desperate

888
00:43:30,687 --> 00:43:32,223
But I don't think

889
00:43:32,479 --> 00:43:34,271
It would interest many people

890
00:43:35,039 --> 00:43:36,831
I think most people just alright

891
00:43:37,087 --> 00:43:38,367
She said

892
00:43:38,623 --> 00:43:39,391
It is a wood bee

893
00:43:39,903 --> 00:43:42,207
And no matter who win who cares

894
00:43:42,719 --> 00:43:43,231
I don't know

895
00:43:43,487 --> 00:43:43,999
Owen

896
00:43:44,511 --> 00:43:45,023
Stuff

897
00:43:45,279 --> 00:43:47,839
Yeah I don't I don't know what the answer is but

898
00:43:48,095 --> 00:43:50,143
It's not this socks man

899
00:43:50,655 --> 00:43:51,935
Walking sucks boo Alex

900
00:43:52,191 --> 00:43:52,703
Boo

901
00:43:52,959 --> 00:43:57,311
Episode short if you want to be mad about it don't be mad at me

902
00:43:58,591 --> 00:44:00,383
Don't be mad at me

903
00:44:02,943 --> 00:44:07,039
Alex is ruining our show that's how bad Alex's

904
00:44:07,295 --> 00:44:08,319
Yeah

905
00:44:09,087 --> 00:44:10,367
Alex had one job

906
00:44:11,903 --> 00:44:13,695
You gave it to himself

907
00:44:14,207 --> 00:44:16,255
He committed to it

908
00:44:16,767 --> 00:44:19,071
He had a week to prepare

909
00:44:19,583 --> 00:44:20,351
Eddie did nothing

910
00:44:22,143 --> 00:44:23,423
He probably doesn't even remember

911
00:44:25,983 --> 00:44:26,495
You probably another

912
00:44:26,751 --> 00:44:28,543
Don't even remember

913
00:44:28,799 --> 00:44:30,847
Damn have a dick

914
00:44:31,103 --> 00:44:34,431
Does he not know that there were people hanging on his every word

915
00:44:34,687 --> 00:44:35,199
That's it

916
00:44:35,455 --> 00:44:37,247
Inexplicably unhappy

917
00:44:37,503 --> 00:44:38,527
I'm not hanging on his every word

918
00:44:38,783 --> 00:44:39,807
Weird words

919
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:40,831
Yes

920
00:44:41,087 --> 00:44:42,879
How to hang on those weird word absolutely

921
00:44:43,391 --> 00:44:48,511
So we'll keep our eyes on this base and see if Alex eventually reveals cubed

922
00:44:51,583 --> 00:44:52,607
Sure

923
00:44:53,631 --> 00:44:54,399
Bomber

924
00:44:54,911 --> 00:44:56,191
It was destined to happen

925
00:44:58,495 --> 00:45:01,567
You know it sucks though cuz we've talked about this already

926
00:45:01,823 --> 00:45:02,591
Be a disappointment

927
00:45:02,847 --> 00:45:03,871
But you know what sucks

928
00:45:04,127 --> 00:45:05,407
It wasn't even a good disappoint

929
00:45:05,663 --> 00:45:11,807
No it wasn't like it was the worst possible path because there's the option of him revealing a

930
00:45:12,063 --> 00:45:14,367
Like a fake name

931
00:45:14,623 --> 00:45:16,671
There is the option of him

932
00:45:16,927 --> 00:45:18,975
Armin tamzarian

933
00:45:19,487 --> 00:45:20,767
There's the option of him pretending

934
00:45:21,023 --> 00:45:21,791
You didn't say it

935
00:45:22,047 --> 00:45:25,887
There's the option of him just complaining about qanon and not revealing it

936
00:45:27,167 --> 00:45:27,935
The option

937
00:45:28,191 --> 00:45:29,471
Did he did take was

938
00:45:30,239 --> 00:45:30,751
To be boring

939
00:45:31,263 --> 00:45:34,591
Complain about zinken 5G all episode and not even

940
00:45:34,847 --> 00:45:36,383
Address the fact that you

941
00:45:36,639 --> 00:45:37,151
Made

942
00:45:37,663 --> 00:45:38,175
Commitment

943
00:45:39,967 --> 00:45:41,503
How do you expect the best

944
00:45:43,039 --> 00:45:43,807
Now it's kind of beer

945
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:47,903
Doesn't feel like it

946
00:45:48,415 --> 00:45:49,183
Well

00:45:51,231 --> 00:45:51,743

Feel better

950
00:45:58,143 --> 00:46:00,447
That's not what I'm frustrated

951
00:46:01,215 --> 00:46:01,983
So frustrating

952
00:46:02,495 --> 00:46:04,031
Boo Alex

953
00:46:04,287 --> 00:46:05,567
