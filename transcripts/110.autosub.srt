00:00:00,256 --> 00:00:02,304
Holding

2
00:00:04,352 --> 00:00:10,496
Alexandra Thurston color

3
00:00:10,752 --> 00:00:16,896
Beverages and talk a little bit

4
00:00:17,152 --> 00:00:17,664
Search

5
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:20,736
Would you just listen to assholes talk about Alec

6
00:00:21,504 --> 00:00:23,808
My life

7
00:00:24,064 --> 00:00:26,368
Has been destroyed

8
00:00:26,624 --> 00:00:29,440
No no

9
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:34,816
Very different levels

10
00:00:35,072 --> 00:00:35,840
Knowledge about

11
00:00:36,096 --> 00:00:38,656
Alex Jones

12
00:00:40,192 --> 00:00:42,240
Not none of the knows nothing

13
00:00:42,752 --> 00:00:44,288
Everything

14
00:00:44,544 --> 00:00:45,312
Blank slate

15
00:00:46,592 --> 00:00:48,384
Tabula rasa

16
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,688
This would be such a weird show if you got

17
00:00:50,944 --> 00:00:51,456
Somebody

18
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:58,112
Every week who actually knew nothing about Alex I never actually learned like if I had some

19
00:00:58,368 --> 00:01:04,512
Sort of weird Episode II El kabong you

20
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,216
Slapnuts

21
00:01:13,472 --> 00:01:13,984
Very offensive

22
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,544
If you say people over the head with a guitar filled with cocaine

23
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:17,568
Jeff Jarrett

24
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:23,968
December 5th

25
00:01:24,736 --> 00:01:25,504
27

26
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:29,344
19 episode correct that would be Tuesday this week

27
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,648
But before

28
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,184
Context drop of Alex Jones

29
00:01:33,952 --> 00:01:37,024
Ward Stone

30
00:01:41,376 --> 00:01:43,936
Marble tablets Mueller

31
00:01:47,776 --> 00:01:50,848
I just wanted to say I love you

32
00:01:53,408 --> 00:01:55,712
Wanted to start off with that so the chat room could have a drink

33
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:04,416
He's on he's on this weird place we was talking about how like

34
00:02:04,672 --> 00:02:05,440
The investigators

35
00:02:05,696 --> 00:02:06,208
Star-gods

36
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:09,024
To the Liberals

37
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:09,792
It's a

38
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:10,816
It's wild

39
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:13,120
I don't get his tip

40
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:14,144
I do

41
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:14,912
I do

42
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:15,680
How's that

43
00:02:15,936 --> 00:02:16,960
And it's just

44
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:17,984
Discrediting

45
00:02:21,568 --> 00:02:24,128
In the eyes of his listeners are probably

46
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:28,480
Blindly following this dumb false god of theirs

47
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:31,296
The only criticism me really ever has as you are in

48
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:37,696
He's up to his eyeballs in Russia stuff

49
00:02:42,048 --> 00:02:42,560
It just happens

50
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:43,840
12 uranium

51
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:44,864
And bringing it

52
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,168
Investigator

53
00:02:47,936 --> 00:02:48,448
Confiscated

54
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:49,472
Georgia

55
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:53,056
Collaborative investigation but

56
00:02:53,312 --> 00:02:54,080
In the United States

57
00:02:54,848 --> 00:02:55,616
Yeah.

58
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:56,384
You screwed it up

59
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,432
Totally yeah that's totally

60
00:02:59,712 --> 00:03:02,016
Jordan over

61
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:03,808
There's a lot of bulshit

62
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:04,576
December 5th episode

63
00:03:06,624 --> 00:03:08,160
Cuz I think if I was going to attack

64
00:03:08,416 --> 00:03:09,440
Wheeler I would go with like

65
00:03:10,976 --> 00:03:14,048
You hang dog punk you know what he looks like

66
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:20,448
Jesus Christ are you going to discipline me

67
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:24,288
50s BBQ gift ideas

68
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:26,336
Let's go to the next hashtag trim

69
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:29,664
Vice principal Mueller

70
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:33,760
It's going to stick

71
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:36,576
I did it

72
00:03:36,832 --> 00:03:37,600
So

73
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:41,952
Ignore a whole lot

74
00:03:42,464 --> 00:03:43,744
About a 20-minute chunk

75
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:46,816
One of the first hour

76
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:50,400
But before we do I want to actually start the episode by going

77
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:51,424
The end of the Opera

78
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,192
Episode

79
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:56,544
Or a little bit later in the episode

80
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,176
Is actually

81
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:02,944
Separate

82
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,528
From what we're going to be going over but it definitely needs to be discussed

83
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:09,344
This is in the middle of it

84
00:04:11,136 --> 00:04:11,648
Is bringing up some

85
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:14,464
And not Infowars world

86
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:23,423
100

87
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:25,983
Products that

88
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:28,543
Not sold on the other side

89
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:31,359
Fortified supply.com

90
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:33,151
Bible and camping store

91
00:04:33,407 --> 00:04:36,223
Exclusive Infowars life reseller

92
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:42,367
Leopard contractually get around

93
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:53,887
To be able to show you camping supplies

94
00:04:54,143 --> 00:04:56,447
Ariana

95
00:04:56,703 --> 00:04:59,007
Lower prices

96
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:01,567
So what are you telling us

97
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:07,711
What do you understand what do you understand from

98
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:11,039
He's getting around

99
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:12,575
Map

100
00:05:13,087 --> 00:05:14,367
What was it again

101
00:05:14,623 --> 00:05:15,391
Lagrima

102
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:18,463
Map Agreements are minimum advertised price

103
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:21,279
Okay they are contractually

104
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:24,863
In place for a reason

105
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:25,887
We'll get to that in a minute

106
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:32,287
And then he's creating a subsidiary separate from his business

107
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:33,311
Indeed

108
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:34,079
But

109
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:36,383
He just revealed that it is his business

110
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:39,455
And he's doing it to get around map again

111
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:40,991
But he says

112
00:05:41,503 --> 00:05:46,879
These people who are supplying the product it's not like I'm doing this in Insidious way they know I'm doing it

113
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:47,903
That's not

114
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:49,951
What are you telling us

115
00:05:50,207 --> 00:05:53,791
But also that business out that can't possibly be true

116
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:58,399
Map of Greece

117
00:05:58,655 --> 00:05:59,167
Okay

118
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:03,775
Right and I'm like

119
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:04,543
Alright

120
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:06,591
Alex

121
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:08,895
We need you to participate

122
00:06:09,407 --> 00:06:11,711
In this program otherwise we can't allow you to do it

123
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:14,015
And then Alex comes back with

124
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:20,415
And they're like

125
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:21,439
You know what that's

126
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:27,327
Negotiations I don't know

127
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:30,399
The suppliers

128
00:06:30,655 --> 00:06:31,679
And see what they think about this

129
00:06:32,703 --> 00:06:37,055
The reason that I bring this up the beginning the show and I want it I want to put a

130
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:37,823
Focus on this

131
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:39,871
Map agreement

132
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:41,151
Exist for

133
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:43,199
And they are

134
00:06:43,455 --> 00:06:44,479
To assure

135
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:45,759
Competition

136
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:47,807
Between different leveled business

137
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:49,599
So for instance

138
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:50,367
Alex

139
00:06:50,623 --> 00:06:51,647
As a large

140
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:53,695
And he can afford

141
00:06:54,207 --> 00:06:54,975
To have lower

142
00:06:55,999 --> 00:07:00,351
Particularly lower-margin Vince a brick-and-mortar store

143
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:03,679
And in order for them to make what they need

144
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:05,727
To stay open and pay their employers

145
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:06,495
Employees

146
00:07:06,751 --> 00:07:10,335
They need to have smaller parts or bigger margins

147
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:12,127
So Alex Jones

148
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:13,151
Bye

149
00:07:13,663 --> 00:07:15,199
Getting around map agreement

150
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:16,479
What you saying is

151
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:22,111
Everyone is agreed that this is the lowest price we can advertise something for

152
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:25,695
Because to advertise for lower would be to undercut

153
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:26,975
People

154
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:28,511
Who can't advertise booth

155
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:30,047
Anything Auto

156
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:32,863
So when he talks about prosperity

157
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:35,167
And when he talks about the idea of

158
00:07:35,423 --> 00:07:36,959
People having a fair chance

159
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:41,055
Back small businesses

160
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:41,823
Absolutely

161
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:44,127
This admission on his part is

162
00:07:44,383 --> 00:07:45,919
Actively working against

163
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:47,711
The idea of the free

164
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:49,247
Fair market

165
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:52,319
Everything you stand for is undercut by the idea of

166
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:54,623
Start a second

167
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:55,903
Subsidiary so I can get around

168
00:07:56,159 --> 00:07:57,183
Agreement

169
00:07:57,439 --> 00:08:00,255
What's Matt's wasn't that an act in

170
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:04,095
Walmarts near Costco

171
00:08:05,631 --> 00:08:06,399
Take a bath

172
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:07,679
To start with

173
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:09,471
In order to push those small business

174
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:10,495
Out

175
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:11,775
And then they would raise their prices

176
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:12,543
Just cuz they don't have any

177
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:13,823
Competition most likely

178
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:18,175
I'm not entirely sure what the reasoning behind it is but it makes a lot of sense

179
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:26,111
Because I can

180
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:31,487
I should be able to destroy a Prosperity at 12

181
00:08:34,815 --> 00:08:38,655
A lot of Studies have been done about people who infringe on

182
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:43,775
You've done these studies Alex

183
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:47,615
Adam study

184
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:49,151
Every time we do a study on this

185
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:51,967
It was a study out of Kellogg

186
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:53,503
Institute

187
00:08:55,807 --> 00:08:56,319
The time

188
00:08:56,575 --> 00:08:57,343
When dried

189
00:08:57,599 --> 00:08:58,111
We describe

190
00:08:58,367 --> 00:09:00,927
What when people

191
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:02,719
Infringe on

192
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:04,255
Charge a lower price

193
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:07,327
What they also do is raise their shipping price

194
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:08,095
In order to

195
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:09,375
To stealthily get the

196
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:12,447
Money that they would have lost right

197
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:18,847
Expected volume and most people don't know about what the shipping cost

198
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:20,383
Going to be until it's already too late

199
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:21,663
Transaction

200
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:23,967
It's absolutely totally legal

201
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:28,063
It's good it's very manipulative

202
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:29,343
Now the other thing

203
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:30,879
The people found

204
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:32,159
When they started

205
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:32,927
These map agreement

206
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:34,719
People who do not follow them

207
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:35,487
When they are

208
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:36,767
Contractually obligated

209
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:38,303
Right is that

210
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:40,607
What you end up doing is you end up

211
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:42,655
Really really hurting your supply

212
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:44,447
You end up hurting your

213
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:45,727
Because

214
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:47,263
There's two there's two prongs two

215
00:09:47,775 --> 00:09:48,287
The first

216
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:49,311
Is that win

217
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:51,615
You don't honor the map of Green Bay

218
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:53,151
Most people do

219
00:09:53,663 --> 00:09:59,807
That people see that that advertised price lower than what they've agreed to

220
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:02,623
So then everybody starts in competition

221
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:03,903
Give lower prices

222
00:10:04,415 --> 00:10:07,231
And it's a race to the bottom everyone loses

223
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:08,767
Everyone who selling these things

224
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:10,303
End up selling them at much

225
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:11,071
Lower margin

226
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:14,143
F****** over people who can't

227
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:14,911
Keep up

228
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:18,495
Secondarily what you do is you weren't the manufacturer

229
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:22,079
Because you create an illusion that their MSRP

230
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:23,103
The manufacturers

231
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:24,383
Adjusted retail price

232
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:26,175
Is actually Piper Inn

233
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:26,943
Inflated

234
00:10:27,199 --> 00:10:27,967
So when you

235
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:28,735
I mean

236
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:32,831
But if you're selling something for let's say

237
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:33,855
Something cost

238
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:36,159
This amount in the the

239
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:38,463
Minimum advertised price

240
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:39,743
Is here and you're selling

241
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:41,791
It makes it look like that

242
00:10:42,047 --> 00:10:43,071
First original price

243
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:44,607
Is ridiculous

244
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:47,679
It's ridiculous.

245
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:48,703
We can't

246
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:52,031
We can't argue that part of what I am trying to say

247
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:53,823
Is that it no point

248
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:55,615
I'm have I ever seen

249
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:57,919
Capitalism

250
00:10:58,175 --> 00:11:00,479
Lead to bad results for everybody involved

251
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:01,247
Right

252
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:02,015
I've never seen

253
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:06,367
Understandable. Talk about the big picture were talking about Alex Jones Act

254
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:10,463
Oye crime

255
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:15,071
We don't have any

256
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:20,703
We don't have his contract so we don't know entirely at the same time he would never bring that up if

257
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:21,727
He wasn't in a cont

258
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:28,383
Would bring up getting around map agreements by starting a new retail website if it wasn't something

259
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:29,919
Who's concerned about unless

260
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:32,223
He's making it up entirely which case

261
00:11:32,479 --> 00:11:33,503
That's the mint

262
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:35,039
Two true facts

263
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:43,231
I've done some research

264
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:44,255
Oh really

265
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:46,815
Never heard you say that

266
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:48,095
Supply.com

267
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:50,911
Does Alex Jones's new subsidiary

268
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:51,935
And I went in

269
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:53,471
Found and hunt hunt

270
00:11:53,727 --> 00:11:55,519
All of the

271
00:11:56,543 --> 00:11:57,567
Website

272
00:11:58,335 --> 00:11:58,847
And double-check

273
00:11:59,103 --> 00:11:59,615
The prices

274
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:01,151
To see what they were selling

275
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:02,943
4

276
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:05,759
Some interesting things

277
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:08,319
Did he

278
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:11,135
What do you mean

279
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:11,903
Essentials

280
00:12:12,159 --> 00:12:15,999
The private label deal if he wants

281
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:17,023
To let safe

282
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:18,303
Super blue

283
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:19,839
Is Tom's of Maine

284
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:23,679
Private labeled

285
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:29,311
Stop putting your business out of Tom's of Maine cost

286
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:30,079
$10

287
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:33,407
Private label

288
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:35,967
It doesn't really matter Tom's of Maine

289
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:38,783
Because they get the wholesale price no matter what

290
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:42,367
And it doesn't hurt Tom's Maine's bottom-line or anybody else

291
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:43,647
Who's selling Tom

292
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:44,415
GameStop

293
00:12:44,671 --> 00:12:47,231
Because you're not supposed to know that that's Tom's of Maine

294
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:51,327
So if you're selling a super Blue 48 that shouldn't affect

295
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:52,863
At all times

296
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:54,399
But unfortunately it.

297
00:12:54,655 --> 00:12:56,191
Well if it's a licensing

298
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:00,287
No matter how much you sell it

299
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:06,943
All you doing is that a smart move because then they don't

300
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:09,247
I have to worry about advertising or any

301
00:13:10,527 --> 00:13:11,551
Private labels

302
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:17,951
None of these instances that I'm about to bring up our private label.

303
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:23,327
Check the specs on them and made sure they were and everything and

304
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:28,959
So how much does the under what's the largest amount

305
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:34,335
Almost nothing

306
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:38,431
Now the here's where it gets f***** nothing is discounted

307
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:41,247
Yeah okay

308
00:13:42,527 --> 00:13:44,319
Weird anomalies that I found

309
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:45,855
But I think are worth bringing up

310
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:49,183
Infowars product

311
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:50,975
And they're sold

312
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:51,999
Literally

313
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:53,279
0 differ

314
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:57,119
Would you expect

315
00:13:57,631 --> 00:14:00,959
But there are some that you know that have like sale price

316
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:01,983
Original price

317
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:05,311
Infowars products

318
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:06,079
Also

319
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:06,847
Exactly the same

320
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:08,383
There's a company called

321
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:09,407
Citizen armor

322
00:14:09,663 --> 00:14:10,687
Which cells like

323
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:11,455
Backpacks

324
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:12,479
Bug out bag

325
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:15,551
Their prices are all exactly the same that you can find on

326
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:16,319
Citizen armor.

327
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:18,879
There is no discount

328
00:14:21,183 --> 00:14:23,743
Android BBM going to be dry

329
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:25,791
Something along the lines of Judge Dredd

330
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:32,959
The read

331
00:14:33,215 --> 00:14:34,239
Next Pixar movie

332
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:35,263
The next Pixar

333
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:37,055
Alright

334
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:38,079
Walking around talking

335
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:40,127
My car is better

336
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:43,711
Now that is a very dark move

337
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:44,991
That's that

338
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:45,759
Those two

339
00:14:46,527 --> 00:14:47,807
From what I can tell Sid

340
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:49,599
Citizen armor might be a newer

341
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:55,487
Yeah so there might be something where

342
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:59,839
Ledge sport

343
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:01,887
This is a new supplier that Alex

344
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:02,911
Yep

345
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:05,215
They sell like camping gear

346
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:06,495
I don't I don't think I saw any

347
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:08,543
Like ID actual time

348
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:10,847
But there's a lot of like sleeping bags

349
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:11,871
And stuff like that

350
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:13,663
Anxiety

351
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:15,199
Sort of interesting describe

352
00:15:16,223 --> 00:15:19,295
The first is there is a river river is the type of

353
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:23,647
If you can go in a river called River

354
00:15:23,903 --> 00:15:25,439
Leather made from River Phoenix

355

River feather-light there's a bunch of lines of bags cat

356
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:32,095
Zero degree sleeping bag

357
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:34,911

358
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:35,679
On both

359
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:36,447
Website

360
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:37,215
As the original

361
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:39,007
It's marked down to

362
00:15:39,263 --> 00:15:40,543
249 99

363
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:41,311
On ledge

Sports markdown 259

365
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:44,639
Running forward

366
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:46,943
So he's selling it a worst this

367
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:49,759
Yeah so that's an instance where he's not trying to

368
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:51,039
To get any

369
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:52,319
Any better deals

370
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:56,927
There's just way too much of it I can scroll around

371
00:15:57,183 --> 00:16:00,511
But go to a Sportster

372
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:03,583

373
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:04,351

No discount

380
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:14,847
Actually probably cheaper

381
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:15,871
On the other one

382
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:17,919
Featherlite

Unless sport

387

Inexplicably

389
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:28,159
Awning for Wars

390
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:31,743
No I mean Mark nope makes

391
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:33,535
Make sense from there because there's

392
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:36,351
Because they're not the the wholesaler

393
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:37,119
Durex

394
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:38,911
Sales they have to go through their own

395
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:45,311
Overhead and they have to go through their own markup there

396
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:46,335
Based on with Alex Jones

397
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:47,359
I'm just pitching this

398
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:49,919
Because I have an independence

399
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:50,943
Subsidiary

400
00:16:51,967 --> 00:16:56,319
All of these are not the cheapest prices

401
00:16:56,575 --> 00:16:58,623
He hasn't he sells heirloom organic

402
00:16:59,647 --> 00:17:01,439
On the on the on there

403
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:02,463
I mean who doesn't

404
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:07,327
Microgreens

405
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:09,375
Complete kit it's $99 on a

406
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:11,423
Infowars

407
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:16,031
Microgreens

408
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:18,079
5999 on Infowars

409
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:19,359
It's

410
00:17:19,615 --> 00:17:21,663
4999

411
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:22,943
Heirloom Organics

412
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:24,223
See that's that's

413
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:31,903
Like this because you're going you're going to something to Alex Jones in advertising

414
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:35,487
Yet I would argue is possible

415
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:37,791
To yourself and will charge extra

416
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:39,839
Is not how Alex Jones

417
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:40,607
Resent

418
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:41,375
What he's doing

419
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:43,167
See you it was lying about the map

420
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:43,935
Right

421
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:44,703
Right

422
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:47,775
Why would you

423
00:17:48,031 --> 00:17:49,055
Pick something so

424
00:17:49,311 --> 00:17:50,847
Specific to lie about

425
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:53,919
Here's what I say we have the lowest prices

426
00:17:54,175 --> 00:17:55,455
Here's where it.

427
00:17:55,711 --> 00:18:01,599
About that why would you lie about cheating up

428
00:18:02,367 --> 00:18:03,391
Well because I think he is

429
00:18:03,903 --> 00:18:05,439
Okay so now we're getting back

430
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:07,487
We'll get to that in a second

431
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:08,511
So

432
00:18:09,023 --> 00:18:11,839
There's a chance that if you go through a breakup

433
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:14,143
This episode of Price is Right going on right now

434
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:16,447
If you go through checkout

435
00:18:16,703 --> 00:18:18,751
But when you put it into your bundle it would be

436
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:20,799
Because that is allowed

437
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:22,847
You can have an advertised price

438
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:25,663
That is $200 and then you put it in your cart

439
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:26,687
17

440
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:28,223
Something like that

441
00:18:28,479 --> 00:18:31,551
That's weagles Tremont

442
00:18:31,807 --> 00:18:33,087
Cam charge

443
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:35,135
Can advertise your charger

444
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:36,671
So conceivably

445
00:18:36,927 --> 00:18:38,463
Any of these prices could be

446
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:39,743
Live

447
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:40,767
Or whatever

448
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:42,303
But does it matter

449
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:44,863
Here is where it's f***** up

450
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:48,703
Once once Alex Jones is stores aren't open and honest with me

451
00:18:49,727 --> 00:18:55,871
Who knows all bets are I understand we're boring the s*** out of people with a bunch of price.

452
00:18:56,127 --> 00:18:59,967
Get through what I've one more supplier that I got very serious

453
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:01,503
So there

454
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:03,039
He sells Harvest Right

455
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:03,807
Freeze dryer

456
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:08,159
I assume those are sex

457
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:10,719
They're very large

458
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:14,303
Things you can put food in and I'll give you like dried apples out of it or something like that

459
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:18,911
You know what that I think we all actually probably need to

460
00:19:19,167 --> 00:19:19,679
Start shopping

461
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:23,007
Like the world is gone

462
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:24,031
It's almost like

463
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:26,847
On this one

464
00:19:27,103 --> 00:19:28,639
I've got a

465
00:19:28,895 --> 00:19:29,407
Can't afford it

466
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:33,503
He was the greatest of the

467
00:19:34,015 --> 00:19:36,575
Just never going to be able to afford the upon

468
00:19:37,087 --> 00:19:43,231
Webst a the greatest disparate amount that we've

469
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:43,999
Prices are wrong

470
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:44,767
All of them

471
00:19:45,535 --> 00:19:48,095
They don't match it all there's no Rhyme or Reason to them

472
00:19:48,351 --> 00:19:51,167
In terms of the actual price or the sale price

473
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:52,447
Matching on

474
00:19:52,703 --> 00:19:56,031
425 Supply or on Harbor Freights website

475
00:19:56,543 --> 00:19:58,079
Okay

476
00:20:02,687 --> 00:20:03,967
On

477
00:20:04,479 --> 00:20:06,783
Fortified Supply Infowars website

478
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:07,807
Yeah it cost

479
00:20:08,063 --> 00:20:10,367
3145 dollars in 50

480
00:20:10,623 --> 00:20:11,135
50 Cent

481
00:20:11,391 --> 00:20:11,903
Markstown

482
00:20:12,415 --> 00:20:13,439
4909

483
00:20:13,695 --> 00:20:14,207
95

484
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:14,975
Okay okay

485
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:16,255
So now

486
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:17,791
On I

487
00:20:18,047 --> 00:20:19,071
Harvest rights website

488
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:21,375
2895

489
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:23,167
For the sale

490
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:24,703
Markdown

491
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:25,983
From 34

492
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:28,287
The difference

493
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:29,055
Is

494
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:30,591
He's charging

495
00:20:31,615 --> 00:20:33,151
$300 more

496
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:34,943
Then they charge on their web

497
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:37,247
And the markdown price

498
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:38,271
But he's pretending

499
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:40,319
To have marked down from

500
00:20:40,575 --> 00:20:42,879
He's also $1,500 higher

501
00:20:43,135 --> 00:20:44,927
Yeah it's an artificially inflated

502
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:47,487
Right which is not what

503
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:48,767
Heritage

504
00:20:49,535 --> 00:20:50,559
Harvest

505
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:54,911
The Heritage Foundation is actually the

506
00:20:55,423 --> 00:21:00,543
Find Harvest right.com vet he's offering a much bigger discount than he is

507
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:01,823
Might be what he's talkin

508
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:06,431
In a very

509
00:21:06,687 --> 00:21:07,967
Specific way

510
00:21:08,223 --> 00:21:08,991
As though

511
00:21:10,527 --> 00:21:13,855
Listeners know what a map agreement is and they're like

512
00:21:14,367 --> 00:21:15,135
Check this out

513
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:18,976
This guy knows even how to screw over regular folks

514
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:24,608
Discuss pricing

515
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:27,168
What was that again

516
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:30,752
The point of it is everything that you can buy on Infowars

517
00:21:31,264 --> 00:21:33,056
Short of Infowars own product

518
00:21:33,568 --> 00:21:34,592
You can find for cheaper elsewhere

519
00:21:36,896 --> 00:21:37,920
Text cheaper elsewhere

520
00:21:38,176 --> 00:21:39,712
Find out what the active ingredient

521
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:42,784
Basically

522
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:45,344
He's pretending that he's going we need to get the word out

523
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,904
And also it mean Italian

524
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:50,208
There's a second reason why you started

525
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:51,744
Subsidiary if this isn't

526
00:21:52,256 --> 00:21:57,888
Okay there's something else you hiding money or something like that there's some other reason why

527
00:21:58,144 --> 00:21:59,936
You've created this whole other website

528
00:22:00,192 --> 00:22:01,728
GameStop

529
00:22:01,984 --> 00:22:03,264
Alabama couple of other things

530
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,312
Add inflated or non discount

531
00:22:06,336 --> 00:22:08,128
Then I don't know what that is yet but I'm going to look at

532
00:22:08,384 --> 00:22:09,152
Furthermore

533
00:22:09,664 --> 00:22:10,176
Should not have taken

534
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:11,968
Jesus Christ

535
00:22:12,224 --> 00:22:18,368
Squarespace site

536
00:22:19,392 --> 00:22:20,160
Let's get

537
00:22:20,416 --> 00:22:21,184
To the show

538
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:21,952
Okay

539
00:22:22,464 --> 00:22:23,744
So today

540
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:32,192
Probably

541
00:22:32,448 --> 00:22:33,728
Might be

542
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:36,032
She might still have a steak and Infowars

543
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:38,592
Start a new LLC

544
00:22:39,104 --> 00:22:42,688
I've heard all that all that might be

545
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:47,040
Started newswars

546

Noel

548
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:53,696
Something happened on

549
00:22:54,464 --> 00:22:54,976
That

550
00:22:55,232 --> 00:22:55,744
Or maybe it happen

551
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:56,512
In a couple days but

552
00:22:58,816 --> 00:22:59,584
Israel map

553
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:05,472

554
00:23:08,032 --> 00:23:09,312
You know he's in a weird

555
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:10,848
Headspace and

556
00:23:11,104 --> 00:23:12,640
He's going to spend

557
00:23:12,896 --> 00:23:14,176
The rest of our episodes

558
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:14,944
Screaming about

559
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:15,712
I'm stuff

560
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:25,184
Of course

561
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:28,512
No I think he does later in the show but it's not part of our episode

562
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:32,352
This is everyone's favorite

563
00:23:32,864 --> 00:23:35,424
This is something that we've got to experience a couple times in

564
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,192
In the past

565
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:37,728
We have are types of Alec

566
00:23:37,984 --> 00:23:39,776
Text that we love esoteric Alex

567
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:40,544
The drunk Alex

568
00:23:41,056 --> 00:23:42,848
This is another version of Alex

569
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:46,176
That we all can Revel in and enjoy

570
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,760
Interrupting a video clip hours

571
00:23:50,784 --> 00:23:55,904
We saw a man if that's on the drinking game we're all going to die alright with the Brian stelter

572
00:23:56,160 --> 00:24:02,304
Sure thing

573
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:04,864
Keith Olbermann about six words

574
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:08,192
This might be worse

575
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:09,472
Interrupt the Alex

576
00:24:10,496 --> 00:24:11,776

00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:25,344
Open multiple bus

581
00:24:27,392 --> 00:24:28,928
Not really

582
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,464
Joe Scarborough

583
00:24:31,488 --> 00:24:33,024
Mysterious left Congress

584
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,816
After a young

585
00:24:35,072 --> 00:24:36,352
Intern was found

586
00:24:40,448 --> 00:24:41,728
She just fell over here whatever

587
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,288
Investigation

588
00:24:49,664 --> 00:24:50,944
First I in church

589
00:24:51,968 --> 00:24:53,248
Worded

590
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:57,856
Investigation of individual

591
00:24:58,112 --> 00:25:00,672
Compromise

592
00:25:00,928 --> 00:25:02,208
Background

593
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:08,864
That's all right about how

594
00:25:17,312 --> 00:25:23,456
Call who absolutely have nothing to do with him and are very uncivil to him and I'm sure that there won't be any mate

595
00:25:24,224 --> 00:25:30,368
Open up on the level right now

596
00:25:30,624 --> 00:25:34,720
Everybody around him

597
00:25:34,976 --> 00:25:38,816
Subsequently registered agent

598
00:25:39,072 --> 00:25:44,192
Switch it over to find out who has committed sexual assaults and then he realized that he was a rapist

599
00:25:44,448 --> 00:25:45,984
Cowboy

600
00:25:48,544 --> 00:25:50,336
Like I often think about how greatest

601
00:25:50,592 --> 00:25:51,616
Sitcom Alex would make

602
00:25:51,872 --> 00:25:53,920
If we didn't live in the world because I like

603
00:25:54,176 --> 00:25:57,504
Donaire then getting off Aaron

604
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:59,808
I'm just being like that's my bush

605
00:26:01,856 --> 00:26:08,000
Bored

606
00:26:12,864 --> 00:26:13,888
A butt

607
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:21,824
We're going to get more into his specific complaints about Mika and Joe and before we do I would like to be fully clear

608
00:26:22,336 --> 00:26:26,432
Peekaboo f*** off we're going to set the record straight on

609
00:26:26,688 --> 00:26:28,736
Some things that Alex Jones but at the same time

610
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:30,528
Mika and Joe have

611
00:26:30,784 --> 00:26:32,320
Very very serious

612
00:26:32,576 --> 00:26:34,880
Royals playing right now

613
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:37,440
They did a lot of normalize

614
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:40,512
Champagne

615
00:26:40,768 --> 00:26:42,304
They're now going like

616
00:26:42,816 --> 00:26:43,584
Oh we were probably

617
00:26:45,888 --> 00:26:46,912
Response

618
00:26:47,168 --> 00:26:48,960
Possibility they're just doubling back

619
00:26:49,216 --> 00:26:51,520
Almost pretending like they didn't have

620
00:26:52,032 --> 00:26:52,800
Kissing sycophantic

621
00:26:54,592 --> 00:26:55,360
To the election

622
00:26:55,616 --> 00:26:58,688
So they can f****** fly a kite terrible

623
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:02,528
Yeah.

624
00:27:02,784 --> 00:27:08,928
Look at these Democrats committing crimes it's like watching

625
00:27:09,184 --> 00:27:12,512
Fist fight between a Nazi and apartheid apology

626
00:27:12,768 --> 00:27:14,304
Spotify

627
00:27:15,584 --> 00:27:16,864
Whoever whoever lives

628
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:23,520
So that sort of opening volley

629
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:24,288
Clip

630
00:27:25,312 --> 00:27:26,592
I believe in this next

631
00:27:26,848 --> 00:27:27,360
Clip

632
00:27:28,896 --> 00:27:30,432
Egyptian to actually starting

633
00:27:30,944 --> 00:27:31,456
The Clippers

634
00:27:31,712 --> 00:27:32,480
Morning Joe

635
00:27:32,736 --> 00:27:33,760
And I cut out nothing

636
00:27:34,016 --> 00:27:35,296
This is just like magic clip

637
00:27:35,808 --> 00:27:37,856
Is the

638
00:27:38,368 --> 00:27:38,880
Maybe

639
00:27:39,136 --> 00:27:43,488
Two-and-a-half segments of his show half an hour 45 minutes

640
00:27:43,744 --> 00:27:45,792
Alright I didn't leave the

641
00:27:46,048 --> 00:27:47,840
Will be an amazing punchline

642
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:51,168
Movable hamburger

643
00:27:53,216 --> 00:27:53,984
Scarborough

644
00:27:59,104 --> 00:28:00,128
In his businesses in his

645
00:28:00,384 --> 00:28:00,896
System

646
00:28:01,152 --> 00:28:02,944
Golf courses in his hotel

647
00:28:03,968 --> 00:28:06,016
Braava 380t

648
00:28:06,272 --> 00:28:08,064
He's keeping

649
00:28:11,136 --> 00:28:13,440
And the news is closing and they're all going to jail

650
00:28:14,208 --> 00:28:16,256
Very long time

651
00:28:19,328 --> 00:28:22,144
Is up on infowars.com right now

652
00:28:24,704 --> 00:28:27,264
From the same swamp monsters

653
00:28:37,248 --> 00:28:39,808
Going

654
00:28:40,064 --> 00:28:40,832
And going

655
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:42,112
And going

656
00:28:42,624 --> 00:28:45,696
When they're the ones that are in bed with the Russians on every front the Democrats

657
00:28:52,096 --> 00:28:53,120
Of the cliff

658
00:28:53,376 --> 00:28:55,424
Weather breaking

659
00:28:56,192 --> 00:28:58,752
So I can start the clip up yet

660
00:29:01,312 --> 00:29:04,128
You know this is all stuff we've kind of talked about already

661
00:29:04,384 --> 00:29:06,688
I don't I don't feel the need to dive into that too much

662
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,528
Understand his analysis

663
00:29:10,784 --> 00:29:11,552
I know you are but what am I

664
00:29:12,576 --> 00:29:14,368
Confusing to me

665
00:29:14,624 --> 00:29:15,136
Because it doesn't

666
00:29:15,648 --> 00:29:21,536
Like a can't hold no like shouldn't be trying to figure out a new angle

667
00:29:21,792 --> 00:29:27,936
Nobody needs a flensing West blower just came out was like Flint

668
00:29:28,192 --> 00:29:32,800
Will definitely get rid of all those directions for you illegally

669
00:29:38,432 --> 00:29:43,296
There's no doubt he committed the crime

670
00:29:44,576 --> 00:29:47,648
I really think it's a dumb thing to Bang a Drum about when

671
00:29:47,904 --> 00:29:49,952
Someone erroneously report something

672
00:29:50,208 --> 00:29:50,720
And then

673
00:29:51,232 --> 00:29:52,000
Appropriate action

674
00:29:52,512 --> 00:29:55,328
You know like that's not that's a bad example

675
00:29:55,584 --> 00:29:59,168
That's a bad example of fake news cuz even Joy Behar

676
00:29:59,424 --> 00:30:01,984
The beginning of this week came on The View and said

677
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:05,056
Look we got that wrong you know we had a bad report that was delivered

678
00:30:07,872 --> 00:30:13,760
Alex later in this episode plays plays the apology and is like

679
00:30:14,016 --> 00:30:14,528
Look at this

680
00:30:14,784 --> 00:30:16,576
Look at this fake apology

681
00:30:16,832 --> 00:30:21,440
Qliktech notice attraction

682
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:25,280
Apologies are still retract

683
00:30:26,304 --> 00:30:30,144
Like even if they're not

684
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:30,912
The stuff

685
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:33,472
So let's not let's get to this year

686
00:30:35,264 --> 00:30:36,800
Don't think about on how quickly he interrupts

687
00:30:37,312 --> 00:30:38,848
I'm going to go with three words Alex

688
00:30:39,104 --> 00:30:39,872
Three words

689
00:30:40,128 --> 00:30:40,896
Alright let's

690
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:54,720
I'm going to interrupt myself it's a while

691
00:30:54,976 --> 00:30:56,768
You have to play for a while

692
00:30:57,024 --> 00:30:58,304
That's weilong

693
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:00,864
Like you you promised something and you did not deliver

694
00:31:02,912 --> 00:31:08,288
Scarborough when he even on Alexa

695
00:31:08,544 --> 00:31:09,824
Position

696
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:10,592
To know

697
00:31:10,848 --> 00:31:12,128
What Trump was thinking around

698
00:31:12,384 --> 00:31:13,408
My time cuz he was

699
00:31:14,944 --> 00:31:15,968
Interviewing him

700
00:31:17,504 --> 00:31:18,272
Yeah that point

701
00:31:18,528 --> 00:31:21,856
Until right around then

702
00:31:22,112 --> 00:31:23,904
That Trump started talk about I'll make his face

703
00:31:26,976 --> 00:31:29,792
I don't know I don't know if that's necessarily the truth

704
00:31:30,048 --> 00:31:30,816
I would imagine

705
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:32,352
Joe Scarborough

706
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:44,128
About money

707
00:31:46,688 --> 00:31:52,832
What Barack Obama

708
00:31:53,088 --> 00:31:58,720
Is he going to be

709
00:31:59,232 --> 00:32:00,512
I can make even more money

710
00:32:04,352 --> 00:32:08,704
But the news is typing

711
00:32:15,616 --> 00:32:19,200
This is just like all the very same people

712
00:32:20,736 --> 00:32:23,296
On television

713
00:32:27,136 --> 00:32:29,184
Hillary

714
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:36,864
All of those things are true though during the campaign

715
00:32:37,376 --> 00:32:37,888
Mika

716
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,168
Game on air

717
00:32:40,192 --> 00:32:41,216
Someone from Hillary's

718
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,264
Had vaguely threatened

719
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:44,288
Her because of things

720
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:45,312
She said on air

721
00:32:45,824 --> 00:32:46,336
So

722
00:32:46,848 --> 00:32:49,920
The idea that during the campaign they were saying Trump could never win

723
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,224
Spiritually

724
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:53,248
Disingenuous

725
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:54,528
And Alex knows that

726
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:56,576
Did you ever read a shattered

727
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,392
The book about Hillary

728
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:02,208
Like I during the whole thing

729
00:33:02,464 --> 00:33:04,768
These reporters got full access to

730
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:06,048
Because they were like

731
00:33:07,328 --> 00:33:09,632
Going to be a celebratory book

732
00:33:09,888 --> 00:33:12,192
And her campaign was f****** bananas

733
00:33:13,472 --> 00:33:14,496
Terrifically bad

734
00:33:16,544 --> 00:33:17,824
I buy everything about

735
00:33:18,848 --> 00:33:20,384
Like normal

736
00:33:22,944 --> 00:33:23,456
Like the

737
00:33:23,712 --> 00:33:24,736
When you just said that

738
00:33:24,992 --> 00:33:27,040
I was I was like probably

739
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:30,112
We could probably made that up and then I read shattered and I was like

740
00:33:31,648 --> 00:33:34,720
Concerned about the truth or falsity of it I'm concerned about them

741
00:33:34,976 --> 00:33:38,304
Like where Joe and Mika

742
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:41,888
More what I was getting at is where they were.

743
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:44,960
Observe

744
00:33:45,216 --> 00:33:45,728
Right

745
00:33:46,496 --> 00:33:48,288
Donald Trump

746
00:33:48,544 --> 00:33:49,824
Just fly

747
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:56,224
President campaign stops today

748
00:33:56,992 --> 00:34:01,600
Why was he screaming and yelling and they will win

749
00:34:08,256 --> 00:34:09,536
You're a fraud

750
00:34:10,816 --> 00:34:14,144
And you're the people that have had ejected

751
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:16,192
Spirit

752
00:34:16,448 --> 00:34:17,728
Almost where

753
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:20,288
You're a loser

754
00:34:26,176 --> 00:34:28,224
So real quick before we continue as he's about to

755
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:33,088
Get back to the clip things that just came out today I was reading was that

756
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:42,304
Alaska

757
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,352
But they had numbers for whatever papers

758
00:34:44,608 --> 00:34:47,680
So the amount of stuff that we're buying from

759
00:34:47,936 --> 00:34:48,960
Overseas

760
00:34:49,472 --> 00:34:50,752
As regular vagina

761
00:34:52,032 --> 00:34:56,640
Yeah that's not good

762
00:34:58,944 --> 00:35:00,480
Let's get back to it

763
00:35:00,992 --> 00:35:02,016
Yeah we can talk about

764
00:35:02,272 --> 00:35:03,552
The stock market numbers

765
00:35:05,088 --> 00:35:06,368
Absolutely

766
00:35:06,624 --> 00:35:07,648
But that's because

767
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:09,952
That's because the stock market has

768
00:35:10,464 --> 00:35:15,584
Completely divorce itself from the reality of our economy which is

769
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:16,352
The issue

770
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:19,424
That's why we have so many booms and busts.

771
00:35:19,936 --> 00:35:20,960
That's why we have

772
00:35:21,216 --> 00:35:23,264
Come Boom for a while there

773
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,032
Because

774
00:35:24,544 --> 00:35:26,336
It had nothing to do with reality

775
00:35:26,592 --> 00:35:27,872
What's a deregulate

776
00:35:28,128 --> 00:35:28,640
Did the stock market

777
00:35:30,176 --> 00:35:30,688
Again Reagan

778
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:32,736
You f****** pile of s*** I hope you get

779
00:35:32,992 --> 00:35:33,760
Alzheimer's again

780
00:35:34,016 --> 00:35:34,528
I hope you

781
00:35:34,784 --> 00:35:35,552
Come back to life

782
00:35:36,064 --> 00:35:36,832
And then are born

783
00:35:37,088 --> 00:35:37,856
With Alzheimer

784
00:35:38,112 --> 00:35:38,624
A disease

785
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,416
And have to live out your 88 year

786
00:35:42,976 --> 00:35:43,744
The point being

787
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,560
Because they deregulated and they allowed so much

788
00:35:46,816 --> 00:35:47,584
Speculation I did

789
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:48,864
Have a

790
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:49,632
Separation

791
00:35:51,168 --> 00:35:52,960
And other one regular

792
00:35:53,472 --> 00:35:54,240
They wound up

793
00:35:54,496 --> 00:35:55,008
Creating this

794
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,056
All about

795
00:35:58,336 --> 00:35:58,848
Wedding

796
00:35:59,104 --> 00:36:00,640
It's a it's a

797
00:36:00,896 --> 00:36:02,176
Of course

798
00:36:02,432 --> 00:36:03,200
Raise the stock

799
00:36:03,456 --> 00:36:03,968
Market everybody

800
00:36:04,224 --> 00:36:04,736
Bedding

801
00:36:04,992 --> 00:36:06,272
That it's going to crash

802
00:36:06,528 --> 00:36:07,296
Eventually

803
00:36:07,552 --> 00:36:09,088
Nobody's betting on

804
00:36:09,344 --> 00:36:11,392
When do and so that's why we're getting a

805
00:36:12,416 --> 00:36:15,744
Queen is over 10,000

806
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:22,144
It's going to be 5 in 2 years

807
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,680
Aunt hands

808
00:36:25,472 --> 00:36:26,496
The other thing is

809
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:29,568
I mean the stock market is continue to go up

810
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:31,616
Bad but especially after that

811
00:36:32,128 --> 00:36:33,664
But it's also like out

812
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:34,432
If you look at it

813
00:36:34,688 --> 00:36:35,456
Before then

814
00:36:38,016 --> 00:36:38,528
Sharper

815
00:36:38,784 --> 00:36:40,832
After that but it's more or less

816
00:36:41,344 --> 00:36:46,720
Kind of expect

817
00:36:47,232 --> 00:36:50,048
And so like that's more indicative of recovery

818
00:36:50,304 --> 00:36:51,840
Growth

819
00:36:52,096 --> 00:36:52,864
If that's what we start

820
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:55,424
FEI we have aspectek

821
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,472
That's the kind of thing you got to be really worried

822
00:36:57,984 --> 00:37:01,056
Because that's not like it's never going to have the stock market at

823
00:37:01,312 --> 00:37:02,080
100000

824
00:37:03,616 --> 00:37:08,480
So anyway if you're if the stock market goes up and the homeless population goes up

825
00:37:08,736 --> 00:37:10,016
Something's not going

826
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:13,600
Let's go back to the club.

827
00:37:14,112 --> 00:37:14,624
So we shall

828
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:23,072
Under the microscope

829
00:37:23,584 --> 00:37:25,632
There is nothing there is no collusion

830
00:37:25,888 --> 00:37:32,032
Charge people for years ago that wasn't even legal

831
00:37:47,392 --> 00:37:50,208
National Security advisor

832
00:37:50,464 --> 00:37:53,024
Or launch a contraction

833
00:37:53,536 --> 00:37:55,584
Right right

834
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:58,400
But also crashing the sanctions

835
00:38:00,192 --> 00:38:06,336
Narrative is there with Flynn they've invited him because there is a

836
00:38:08,128 --> 00:38:08,640
You can have

837
00:38:08,896 --> 00:38:09,664
FBI agent

838
00:38:10,176 --> 00:38:12,224
Right right if your

839
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:15,552
Praetorian guard

840
00:38:15,808 --> 00:38:21,952
No

841
00:38:22,208 --> 00:38:23,488
Of some FBI agents

842
00:38:23,744 --> 00:38:26,048
Spending like pro-hillary text

843
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:26,816
The messages

844
00:38:27,072 --> 00:38:33,216
Stuff like that handle handle

845
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:38,080
His narrative is that the people were spying

846
00:38:38,336 --> 00:38:42,688
And these phone calls is reasonable because

847
00:38:42,944 --> 00:38:48,064
It's the Russian Ambassador that they're spying on him at least

848
00:38:49,856 --> 00:38:54,208
Husband had a warrant right it's so Alex is claiming

849
00:38:54,464 --> 00:38:58,048
What is FBI agent pocket of Hillary

850
00:38:58,304 --> 00:38:59,840
Is making these claims

851
00:39:00,352 --> 00:39:02,656
The only thing they have to go on is his note

852
00:39:04,448 --> 00:39:09,312
AZ fall FBI investigations and interviews aren't recorded

853
00:39:09,568 --> 00:39:14,688
You go to a local Precinct they record truck in Everett

854
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:15,712
Like

855
00:39:15,968 --> 00:39:20,064
Any any kind of corruption that could happen you got to have backup that's

856
00:39:21,088 --> 00:39:22,624
Stupid

857
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,416
Pro Hillary FBI agent

858
00:39:24,928 --> 00:39:28,256
Do you like oh that's because I got these notes

859
00:39:33,632 --> 00:39:34,912
Now

860
00:39:35,168 --> 00:39:36,704
Alex Lin was

861
00:39:37,728 --> 00:39:40,800
Triple deep-cover FBI Hillary age

862
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:44,384
The whole time he was like

863
00:39:45,408 --> 00:39:47,200
I'm going to plead guilty eventually

864
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:48,736
Alex's

865
00:39:48,992 --> 00:39:49,760
I would wait until I can't

866
00:39:50,528 --> 00:39:51,808
Alex really

867
00:39:52,064 --> 00:39:54,368
Needs to look into the FBI agent

868
00:39:55,392 --> 00:39:57,440
Stuff to let's say Giuliani

869
00:40:04,096 --> 00:40:04,864
The Patriot

870
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:10,496
Can do whatever they want because they're doing

871
00:40:10,752 --> 00:40:12,032
They're doing

872
00:40:13,824 --> 00:40:15,616
Them right

873
00:40:15,872 --> 00:40:18,688
This whole thing about the possibility of Erik Prince

874
00:40:18,944 --> 00:40:19,456
Creating C

875
00:40:19,712 --> 00:40:20,480
Some sort of intelligence

876
00:40:21,248 --> 00:40:22,272
Organization

877
00:40:22,784 --> 00:40:24,064
You know what I'm fine with it

878
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:25,344
I'm not

879
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:27,648
Cuz Eric Prince is a f****** idiot

880
00:40:28,416 --> 00:40:30,208
If they did if they allow air

881
00:40:30,464 --> 00:40:32,512
Prince to create a deep state bulshit

882
00:40:32,768 --> 00:40:33,280
I'm fine with that

883
00:40:33,536 --> 00:40:35,328
No cuz it's going to lead to a lot of murders

884
00:40:35,584 --> 00:40:36,096
Yeah

885
00:40:36,608 --> 00:40:37,888
Tulare

886
00:40:40,192 --> 00:40:41,472
Yeah I already sent it to fascism

887
00:40:42,496 --> 00:40:44,288
Interrupted Village Quebec

888
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:50,944
Andres Truitt

889
00:40:54,272 --> 00:40:56,064
You're exactly right

890
00:40:56,576 --> 00:41:01,184
Just like Joy Behar

891
00:41:19,872 --> 00:41:20,640
Father

892
00:41:21,408 --> 00:41:24,224
Create another subsidiary to avoid

893
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:25,248
Right

894
00:41:29,856 --> 00:41:31,136
If you watch the video of it

895
00:41:31,392 --> 00:41:34,720
Can see him constantly looking off camera as if

896
00:41:34,976 --> 00:41:37,536
I think what he's doing is he's checking the how long till commercial

897
00:41:37,792 --> 00:41:39,072
Like to see like

898
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:41,888
How much how long is

899
00:41:42,144 --> 00:41:48,288
It really it really really breaks the illusion that he actually means what he says

900
00:41:48,544 --> 00:41:49,824
Worked up

901
00:41:51,616 --> 00:41:53,663
3 minutes

902
00:41:54,431 --> 00:41:55,967
F***

903
00:41:56,479 --> 00:41:56,991
So you get back to

904
00:41:59,039 --> 00:42:04,415
The what's gotten them where they are right now Josh

905
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:10,303
A gross misunderstanding

906
00:42:11,071 --> 00:42:13,887
Of Washington

907
00:42:14,143 --> 00:42:18,495
Washington public service

908
00:42:27,455 --> 00:42:28,735
I think it's going to go on forever

909
00:42:28,991 --> 00:42:35,135
Nothing you do will ever

910
00:42:38,207 --> 00:42:40,511
Michael Steele

911
00:42:47,167 --> 00:42:49,983
Here's your eviction notice out of our lives

912
00:42:51,007 --> 00:42:57,151
It makes me so angry

913
00:43:04,063 --> 00:43:07,903
What are the rules of History I don't know because he's not

914
00:43:09,951 --> 00:43:14,559
This literally reminds me of The Daily Show segment even Steven

915
00:43:14,815 --> 00:43:20,447
No Steve Carell and Stephen Colbert with debates

916
00:43:24,799 --> 00:43:27,103
You play visit this video

917
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:30,943
Mika and Joe

918
00:43:31,711 --> 00:43:37,087
You're a loser

919
00:43:37,343 --> 00:43:39,647
You guys are an idiot anyway

920
00:43:39,903 --> 00:43:44,255
Trump doesn't know the rules

921
00:43:45,535 --> 00:43:46,303
Race memory

922
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:47,583
Right that's how you learn

923
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:49,887
Should I forgot I don't know

924
00:43:50,399 --> 00:43:52,703
That's a good ruler

925
00:43:52,959 --> 00:43:55,775
They're up to something

926
00:43:56,031 --> 00:43:58,079
Right that's enough

927
00:43:58,335 --> 00:43:59,359
Right

928
00:44:00,127 --> 00:44:01,663
Watch a white after Labor Day

929
00:44:01,919 --> 00:44:03,199
That's a good ruler

930
00:44:04,479 --> 00:44:06,527
What is that what the rules about

931
00:44:11,903 --> 00:44:12,671
When is Labor Day

932
00:44:12,927 --> 00:44:14,719
Don't know

933
00:44:15,999 --> 00:44:17,535
What is white can't wear white

934
00:44:21,887 --> 00:44:25,983
He doesn't really elaborate on the road that we don't get to learn what those are

935
00:44:26,239 --> 00:44:30,335
I'm so here's the next one next clip he comes back from the commercial break and we'll see

936
00:44:30,591 --> 00:44:31,359
See I will see where he's at

937
00:44:31,871 --> 00:44:38,015
Build a wall against hard for me to play this clip and not get angry

938
00:44:38,271 --> 00:44:43,135
Bad Liars they are

939
00:44:45,439 --> 00:44:45,951
What what

940
00:44:46,207 --> 00:44:50,047
On ER

941
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:03,615
Washed up

942
00:45:14,111 --> 00:45:18,463
How Washington works

943
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:20,767
All these are mummies up there

944
00:45:21,023 --> 00:45:24,351
He just wants money

945
00:45:32,031 --> 00:45:36,127
Established

946
00:45:39,199 --> 00:45:42,783
Ouija City Ariel

947
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:47,135
Let's go back to the discussion

948
00:45:47,391 --> 00:45:50,719
Option care

949
00:46:00,191 --> 00:46:01,983
Her dad was a famous Criminal

950
00:46:02,495 --> 00:46:06,335
Not really

951
00:46:06,591 --> 00:46:09,151
You misread my book.

952
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:17,087
Operation

953
00:46:19,391 --> 00:46:21,183
Our Lives

954
00:46:28,351 --> 00:46:28,863
I pray

955
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:29,887
For justice

956
00:46:33,471 --> 00:46:35,263
So I mean that's a load up a clip

957
00:46:38,335 --> 00:46:40,383
I don't really know or care what they are

958
00:46:45,503 --> 00:46:46,527
Navigations God

959
00:46:46,783 --> 00:46:48,575
You might get what you want

960
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:50,367
Migrate

961
00:46:50,623 --> 00:46:55,999
I think that's I think that's my main issue with is there's no collusion there's no none of that stuff

962
00:46:56,255 --> 00:46:58,047
Because like we have been

963
00:46:58,303 --> 00:47:00,607
Think about there's nowhere to go

964
00:47:00,863 --> 00:47:01,375
When

965
00:47:01,631 --> 00:47:02,143
It happen

966
00:47:03,423 --> 00:47:06,495
Like there's nowhere for him to go he can't just say

967
00:47:06,751 --> 00:47:07,263
Whoops

968
00:47:08,287 --> 00:47:10,079
Fadoodle I was wrong the whole time

969
00:47:12,895 --> 00:47:16,479
Yeah yeah it's a dangerous position for him to be another property

970
00:47:16,735 --> 00:47:17,247
Because

971
00:47:17,503 --> 00:47:19,039
Of his documented at least

972
00:47:19,295 --> 00:47:21,087
Year-and-a-half long Association

973
00:47:21,343 --> 00:47:22,111
Rodger Stone

974
00:47:23,391 --> 00:47:24,415
Constant I talked

975
00:47:24,671 --> 00:47:25,439
The Trump stuff

976
00:47:26,975 --> 00:47:28,255
When all this breaks

977
00:47:28,511 --> 00:47:29,279
Says it will

978
00:47:29,535 --> 00:47:32,351
There's really no way for him to plead ignorance about anything

979
00:47:33,375 --> 00:47:34,399
You can't incriminate him

980
00:47:34,655 --> 00:47:35,935
Himself and being a part of this

981
00:47:37,727 --> 00:47:38,239
To do is

982
00:47:38,751 --> 00:47:40,287
Do you know this is our duly elected

983
00:47:40,799 --> 00:47:41,567
Caesar is he calls

984
00:47:43,615 --> 00:47:48,735
Great great love it

985
00:47:48,991 --> 00:47:52,063
That's the only place to go and then

986
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:56,927
Dangerous place to go

987
00:47:58,975 --> 00:47:59,487
The only play

988
00:48:00,767 --> 00:48:01,279
I hope it's

989
00:48:01,791 --> 00:48:04,351
Deescalate

990
00:48:04,607 --> 00:48:05,375
It's possible but I just

991
00:48:05,887 --> 00:48:06,399
Based on

992
00:48:06,655 --> 00:48:08,191
What we see of the all right

993
00:48:08,447 --> 00:48:09,471
And the people

994
00:48:09,727 --> 00:48:11,519
And how unfairly they play in

995
00:48:11,775 --> 00:48:12,543
How they use

996
00:48:13,055 --> 00:48:15,103
Faith very intentionally

997
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:18,687
I don't see I don't see a situation where things get

998
00:48:18,943 --> 00:48:22,527
Escalated I just via getting worse point where

999
00:48:23,295 --> 00:48:26,111
Sing with Nazis like

1000
00:48:26,367 --> 00:48:28,671
Never-ending fascination of World War II

1001
00:48:28,927 --> 00:48:29,951
Is a

1002
00:48:30,207 --> 00:48:31,487
Unilateral bag

1003
00:48:32,255 --> 00:48:34,559
Like the guys committing a holocaust

1004
00:48:34,815 --> 00:48:36,351
There's no negotiation

1005
00:48:36,607 --> 00:48:39,167
There's no nothing right you have to fight and kill them

1006
00:48:39,679 --> 00:48:44,031
So we're getting with our homegrown right where it's like you guys

1007
00:48:45,055 --> 00:48:48,383
Unequivocally bad but simultaneously

1008
00:48:48,639 --> 00:48:51,711
Influence by anything else so we're getting to the point where

1009
00:48:52,735 --> 00:48:55,551
Simultaneously though as that

1010
00:48:55,807 --> 00:48:56,831
Sort of reality is

1011
00:48:57,343 --> 00:48:57,855
Is happening

1012
00:48:58,111 --> 00:48:58,879
Most people are paying

1013
00:48:59,135 --> 00:48:59,647
Attention to it

1014
00:49:02,207 --> 00:49:04,767
You have them and their immediate

1015
00:49:05,023 --> 00:49:06,047
Channels and it there

1016
00:49:09,375 --> 00:49:10,655
Yeah they're doing

1017
00:49:10,911 --> 00:49:11,423
The exact same

1018
00:49:11,679 --> 00:49:12,447
Same thing to Muslim

1019
00:49:12,703 --> 00:49:17,823
Right so they're creating an unequivocal Superbad guy

1020
00:49:18,591 --> 00:49:22,943
I meant pedophiles to but that's sort of in service of demonizing Muslim

1021
00:49:23,711 --> 00:49:25,759
They love their own pet

1022
00:49:26,271 --> 00:49:30,623
They left a good pet for fear of them

1023
00:49:31,903 --> 00:49:33,695
We need the Japanese to bomb Pearl Harbor

1024
00:49:34,207 --> 00:49:35,231
I think that's what's really

1025
00:49:36,511 --> 00:49:37,023
Yep

1026
00:49:37,279 --> 00:49:41,631
Volkswagen

1027
00:49:42,399 --> 00:49:42,911
Globalist

1028
00:49:43,167 --> 00:49:45,215
Exactly it's the

1029
00:49:45,471 --> 00:49:48,543
Assailable Ironclad logico psychosis

1030
00:49:50,335 --> 00:49:54,687
Whatever whatever thing you think could bring people together

1031
00:49:54,943 --> 00:49:56,223
Like let's say

1032
00:49:56,479 --> 00:49:56,991
Cuz we're coming

1033
00:49:57,759 --> 00:49:58,271
Piece of evidence

1034
00:49:58,527 --> 00:49:59,551
Is eventually going to fall

1035
00:49:59,807 --> 00:50:01,087
Probably is already

1036
00:50:01,343 --> 00:50:02,367
Discovered in just not public

1037
00:50:02,623 --> 00:50:03,135
Look at this point

1038
00:50:04,927 --> 00:50:06,463
Collusion on a massive

1039
00:50:06,719 --> 00:50:07,231
Food scale

1040
00:50:07,487 --> 00:50:09,023
And it's not necessarily

1041
00:50:09,535 --> 00:50:11,327
Doesn't even matter

1042
00:50:11,839 --> 00:50:14,399
Like he should already be impeached

1043
00:50:17,727 --> 00:50:20,031
He is literally broken the concert

1044
00:50:21,311 --> 00:50:22,079
Doesn't matter

1045
00:50:22,335 --> 00:50:25,663
Make money off of being

1046
00:50:25,919 --> 00:50:30,015

The cookie the cookie

1049
00:50:32,831 --> 00:50:33,343
That's true

1050
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:39,231
You wasn't an alpha like Trump standing up to this pissant globalist attack

1051
00:50:40,511 --> 00:50:41,023
You can't

1052
00:50:41,279 --> 00:50:43,327
Because

The duchenne all the time you don't understand

1055
00:50:49,215 --> 00:50:51,263
The Constitution every amendments that's the 30

1056
00:50:51,775 --> 00:50:53,055
Has been unconstitutional

1057
00:50:53,567 --> 00:50:57,151
Right under common law if you're a sovereign citizen

1058
00:50:57,407 --> 00:50:57,919
That's true

1059
00:51:00,223 --> 00:51:01,247
And I think you should

1060
00:51:01,503 --> 00:51:02,527
Still be able to own slaves

1061
00:51:02,783 --> 00:51:05,087
As you should

1062
00:51:05,343 --> 00:51:09,695
Every libertarian has to believe you should be able to every Admiral

1063
00:51:14,559 --> 00:51:15,071
Going to restart the cliff

1064
00:51:15,583 --> 00:51:16,095
So let's go back to the

1065
00:51:16,607 --> 00:51:18,143
Let's restart the club

Text Anna rupnow

1067
00:51:20,191 --> 00:51:21,215
You know

1068
00:51:27,103 --> 00:51:32,223
But it was all

1069
00:51:42,975 --> 00:51:47,583
What Barack Obama

1070
00:51:48,095 --> 00:51:48,607
Can do it

1071
00:51:51,167 --> 00:51:53,983
Office it's 70 the oldest president ever elected

1072

Dementia

1073

Before except for George Washington

1074
00:52:02,687 --> 00:52:03,455
The founder

1075
00:52:03,711 --> 00:52:07,295
He was not

1076
00:52:07,807 --> 00:52:10,111
Joe Scarborough

1077
00:52:11,903 --> 00:52:14,207
And they're sitting there saying about Trump

1078
00:52:15,999 --> 00:52:19,583
They didn't get ready American English

1079
00:52:22,399 --> 00:52:24,191
Swamp creatures

1080
00:52:24,447 --> 00:52:25,471
What are swamp creatures

1081
00:52:28,031 --> 00:52:29,055
Cool he's going to

1082
00:52:33,151 --> 00:52:33,663
Why can't

1083
00:52:34,943 --> 00:52:35,711
Stop starting

1084
00:52:36,735 --> 00:52:37,247
He could just

1085
00:52:38,527 --> 00:52:41,087
Play no cuz he wants to see what do you know

1086
00:52:41,343 --> 00:52:42,879
We talked about this over and over again

1087
00:52:43,135 --> 00:52:44,159
Alex Jones comedian

1088
00:52:44,415 --> 00:52:49,535
Stylings is get every f****** drop out of it at work

1089
00:52:49,791 --> 00:52:52,351
And a rabid dog when he gets

1090
00:52:52,607 --> 00:52:55,423
Today's old clip in his mouth he has to take out Rachel over

1091
00:52:55,935 --> 00:53:00,031
You had so much nothing to go over on this show

1092
00:53:01,055 --> 00:53:06,431
This was from like what December 2nd Tuesday I believe it was on Scarborough maybe at the

1093
00:53:06,687 --> 00:53:08,735
The Friday of last week

1094
00:53:08,991 --> 00:53:09,503
I don't think

1095
00:53:10,015 --> 00:53:11,807
I'm not entirely sure

1096
00:53:12,319 --> 00:53:13,087
To give a date

1097
00:53:13,343 --> 00:53:15,135
I can't figure that out

1098
00:53:15,647 --> 00:53:16,159
Analysis

1099
00:53:17,695 --> 00:53:19,231
I have never watched that show

1100
00:53:19,999 --> 00:53:21,023
Judging by what we're listen

1101
00:53:22,047 --> 00:53:22,559
The shity show

1102
00:53:24,607 --> 00:53:29,471
Interesting at all

1103
00:53:29,983 --> 00:53:32,031
You know he didn't even do the thing

1104
00:53:32,543 --> 00:53:33,567
And the other guys like

1105
00:53:34,591 --> 00:53:35,871
It would be more interesting

1106
00:53:36,127 --> 00:53:42,271
To me if they turned it into a Shakespearean sort of what

1107
00:53:44,831 --> 00:53:47,647
That would be more interesting like really trying to deal with like

1108
00:53:47,903 --> 00:53:50,719
We had a role to play in this

1109
00:53:50,975 --> 00:53:53,279
That sort of thing

1110
00:53:53,791 --> 00:53:56,607
If they turned Morning Joe into like a Greek tragedy

1111
00:53:56,863 --> 00:53:57,631
That would be amazing

1112
00:53:57,887 --> 00:53:58,655
That would be

1113
00:53:58,911 --> 00:54:00,959
So great

1114
00:54:01,215 --> 00:54:02,239
All life is

1115
00:54:02,495 --> 00:54:03,007
Subway

1116
00:54:05,311 --> 00:54:11,455
Don't like what is my light is he going to be thanking everyday how can I leverage this

1117
00:54:12,991 --> 00:54:14,271
I can make you the more money

1118
00:54:20,671 --> 00:54:23,231
How do I leverage this down for 15 years on television

1119
00:54:23,487 --> 00:54:24,511
Information

1120
00:54:25,023 --> 00:54:26,559
And everybody saying is about

1121
00:54:26,815 --> 00:54:27,327
Him

1122
00:54:29,887 --> 00:54:30,399
Him

1123
00:54:32,191 --> 00:54:32,703
So what's good

1124
00:54:33,983 --> 00:54:34,751
But that's not

1125
00:54:35,007 --> 00:54:35,775
That's not real

1126
00:54:37,823 --> 00:54:39,871
That's not reality Frozen opportunist

1127
00:54:40,127 --> 00:54:41,407
Piece of s***

1128
00:54:41,663 --> 00:54:44,223
We do have an issue with the revolving door between

1129
00:54:44,479 --> 00:54:49,855
Washington and the private sector and lobbyists and all of that yet

1130
00:54:50,367 --> 00:54:50,879
Not

1131
00:54:51,647 --> 00:54:52,415
Jewelry

1132
00:54:52,927 --> 00:54:53,439
It's the

1133
00:54:53,695 --> 00:54:54,207
Jewelry

1134
00:54:55,999 --> 00:54:56,511
It look

1135
00:54:56,767 --> 00:54:57,535
Obama's going to make

1136
00:54:57,791 --> 00:54:59,071
So much more

1137
00:54:59,583 --> 00:55:00,607
Then he did while he

1138
00:55:00,863 --> 00:55:01,375
Who is president

1139
00:55:04,959 --> 00:55:06,495
He wasn't using the office of

1140
00:55:06,751 --> 00:55:08,031
The presidency to make butter

1141
00:55:08,287 --> 00:55:11,103
He's leveraged

1142
00:55:12,639 --> 00:55:14,687
Is not necessarily like a huge.

1143
00:55:14,943 --> 00:55:15,455
Distinction to me

1144
00:55:17,503 --> 00:55:18,527
Really really sad

1145
00:55:19,039 --> 00:55:19,807
It is a big deal

1146
00:55:20,319 --> 00:55:24,415
But I want to talk more about this idea that Joe Scarborough killed it

1147
00:55:24,927 --> 00:55:25,439
I think that's

1148
00:55:25,695 --> 00:55:27,999
Cuz he's now brought it up twice and it is time for us

1149
00:55:29,279 --> 00:55:31,583
This is about a lady named Lori

1150
00:55:31,839 --> 00:55:32,351
Klausutis

1151
00:55:32,863 --> 00:55:34,399
She was 28 years old

1152
00:55:34,655 --> 00:55:35,935
She was an intern at

1153
00:55:36,191 --> 00:55:38,239
Joe Scarborough's office

1154
00:55:38,495 --> 00:55:39,263
Florida

1155
00:55:40,287 --> 00:55:40,799
She died

1156
00:55:41,823 --> 00:55:42,591
From

1157
00:55:43,103 --> 00:55:45,919
Related

1158
00:55:46,175 --> 00:55:48,735
Earlier In that clip

1159
00:55:49,247 --> 00:55:50,015
He's going to talk more

1160
00:55:52,831 --> 00:55:53,599
Right

1161
00:55:55,903 --> 00:55:57,695
She had an irregularity in

1162
00:55:57,951 --> 00:55:58,463
In her heart

1163
00:55:58,719 --> 00:55:59,231
They caused her to

1164
00:55:59,487 --> 00:55:59,999
To pass out

1165
00:56:00,511 --> 00:56:02,559
And when she passed out she hit her head on a desk

1166
00:56:03,327 --> 00:56:03,839
Now

1167
00:56:04,863 --> 00:56:06,399
The medical examiner is that

1168
00:56:06,655 --> 00:56:11,263
She would have died whether she hit her head on the desk for most likely

1169
00:56:11,519 --> 00:56:12,287
Because of the timing

1170
00:56:12,543 --> 00:56:18,175
That's the blunt force trauma did end up killing her but

1171
00:56:19,455 --> 00:56:20,735
The government aneurysm

1172
00:56:22,783 --> 00:56:23,295
Arrhythmia

1173
00:56:26,623 --> 00:56:28,415
Beat beating of her heart.

1174
00:56:28,671 --> 00:56:29,183
Flared up

1175
00:56:30,719 --> 00:56:34,303
It doesn't even have to be diagnosed before real I mean

1176
00:56:34,559 --> 00:56:37,119
People who are otherwise healthy

1177
00:56:37,375 --> 00:56:42,751
Was even like a she would run like four and eight cases and stuff like that

1178
00:56:43,007 --> 00:56:43,775
And it is

1179
00:56:44,031 --> 00:56:45,055
That doesn't

1180
00:56:45,311 --> 00:56:49,407
Meme oh she ran a bunch so why would her heart like it's not

1181
00:56:49,663 --> 00:56:50,687
Cover-up yeah totally

1182
00:56:50,943 --> 00:56:54,783
Like to present the idea

1183
00:56:55,039 --> 00:56:56,063
She was hit in the head with

1184
00:56:56,575 --> 00:56:57,599
She was murdered

1185
00:56:58,111 --> 00:56:59,135
The medical examiner is

1186
00:56:59,391 --> 00:57:00,415
It's been very clear about

1187
00:57:00,671 --> 00:57:01,951
But that's not possible

1188
00:57:02,207 --> 00:57:04,255
Based on the way her head trauma will have

1189
00:57:06,047 --> 00:57:06,559
You get

1190
00:57:06,815 --> 00:57:07,327
Hit by some

1191
00:57:08,095 --> 00:57:10,399
Like it before in the head

1192
00:57:10,655 --> 00:57:12,447
What ends up happening is you will have

1193
00:57:12,703 --> 00:57:16,287
Like a Bruisin matoma or whatever you'll have

1194
00:57:16,543 --> 00:57:19,103
Damage on the same side of your head

1195
00:57:19,359 --> 00:57:21,919
Because your head will go along with

1196
00:57:22,175 --> 00:57:23,199
However the hit Co

1197
00:57:24,223 --> 00:57:24,735
The foreign agent

1198
00:57:24,991 --> 00:57:26,015
Pastor register retroarch

1199
00:57:26,271 --> 00:57:31,135
But if you fall and hit the stationary object

1200
00:57:31,391 --> 00:57:34,719
What will happen is you'll have a mark on this side externally

1201
00:57:34,975 --> 00:57:37,535
And you'll have bruising on your brain on the other side

1202
00:57:37,791 --> 00:57:39,583
Because your head will stop

1203
00:57:39,839 --> 00:57:40,351
Motion

1204
00:57:40,607 --> 00:57:44,191
Your head is going in One Direction and The inertia will cause your brain

1205
00:57:44,447 --> 00:57:45,471
I hit the side of your head

1206
00:57:50,079 --> 00:57:51,103
In die in hurricane

1207
00:57:51,359 --> 00:57:54,431
So for really make this argument

1208
00:57:54,687 --> 00:57:55,711
Throw her head onto the deck

1209
00:57:58,527 --> 00:57:59,295
Maybe

1210
00:57:59,551 --> 00:58:04,415
Maybe just Joe Scarborough

1211
00:58:05,183 --> 00:58:05,951
Put her head in a

1212
00:58:06,207 --> 00:58:06,719
Advice

1213
00:58:07,487 --> 00:58:09,279
And then head that way

1214
00:58:09,535 --> 00:58:11,839
It would look like it was reasonable for her to

1215
00:58:12,863 --> 00:58:16,447
Don't you know that Scarborough famously had vices all over his office

1216
00:58:16,703 --> 00:58:21,311
Lights

1217
00:58:22,847 --> 00:58:26,431
The other the other piece of it too is just like the the heart condition

1218
00:58:28,735 --> 00:58:33,087
It's very clear you can tell that from a post like a post-mortem

1219
00:58:33,343 --> 00:58:34,367
Autopsy

1220
00:58:34,623 --> 00:58:36,927
Her heart stopped beating before

1221
00:58:38,207 --> 00:58:38,975
Send it before.

1222
00:58:40,767 --> 00:58:43,327
Indicate to you this is an arrhythmia that caused her to pass

1223
00:58:43,583 --> 00:58:45,631
Also two witnesses have said that

1224
00:58:45,887 --> 00:58:46,911
She was feeling

1225
00:58:47,167 --> 00:58:48,959
Weird or ill that day

1226
00:58:49,215 --> 00:58:52,031
Right underlying thing

1227
00:58:52,543 --> 00:58:55,871
Slayer.

1228
00:58:56,127 --> 00:59:02,271
Whenever whenever he tells one out related to Scarborough one of them was just her mail carrier

1229
00:59:03,295 --> 00:59:03,807
He pulls out

1230
00:59:04,063 --> 00:59:04,575
The heart rate

1231
00:59:04,831 --> 00:59:07,903
And then notices that it's not beating is like dude you got to get

1232
00:59:08,159 --> 00:59:09,951
Checked out

1233
00:59:12,767 --> 00:59:16,607
Scarborough was in Washington

1234
00:59:17,887 --> 00:59:18,399
Florida author

1235
00:59:18,655 --> 00:59:23,775
Spell

1236
00:59:24,287 --> 00:59:24,799
Have you seen the Press

1237
00:59:26,847 --> 00:59:27,615
Just got rehearsal

1238
00:59:28,127 --> 00:59:28,639
Okay

1239
00:59:29,919 --> 00:59:30,687
Anyway

1240
00:59:30,943 --> 00:59:31,967
Just garbage intelligent

1241
00:59:32,223 --> 00:59:33,503
This is a real tragedy

1242
00:59:34,783 --> 00:59:37,343
Outplex the present also

1243
00:59:39,903 --> 00:59:40,671
There was

1244
00:59:40,927 --> 00:59:43,231
Yeah it didn't get a lot of press coverage

1245
00:59:43,999 --> 00:59:45,279
I can tell you exactly why

1246
00:59:46,559 --> 00:59:47,071
It happened

1247
00:59:47,327 --> 00:59:48,351
2 months before 9

1248
00:59:49,119 --> 00:59:55,007
The web investigations were ongoing Joe Scarborough committed 911

1249
01:00:03,455 --> 01:00:09,599
Other things happened around the same time that Gary was being accused of murdering Chandra Levy

1250
01:00:09,855 --> 01:00:10,367
She also didn't

1251
01:00:14,975 --> 01:00:16,511
A couple of interns

1252
01:00:17,023 --> 01:00:19,839
Ford representative

1253
01:00:20,095 --> 01:00:23,935
Just the two and Gary condit's one was way creepier and

1254
01:00:24,447 --> 01:00:25,983
Much more definitely murder

1255
01:00:27,519 --> 01:00:32,127
This one was very much an accident

1256
01:00:32,383 --> 01:00:36,223
That was really strange but there was an investigation

1257
01:00:37,247 --> 01:00:38,271
Determined

1258
01:00:39,807 --> 01:00:43,391
Unsolved mystery and why didn't they ever do an investigation

1259
01:00:43,647 --> 01:00:45,951
He is literally just a mirroring things that

1260
01:00:46,975 --> 01:00:47,999
That are not true

1261
01:00:48,255 --> 01:00:49,279
It's absolutely not true

1262
01:00:49,535 --> 01:00:51,583
Still have a note on her

1263
01:00:51,839 --> 01:00:52,607
Call Larry Nichols

1264
01:00:52,863 --> 01:00:54,399
But also still

1265
01:00:54,655 --> 01:00:55,679
F*** Joe Scarborough

1266
01:00:55,935 --> 01:01:01,055
Scarborough

1267
01:01:01,311 --> 01:01:02,079
Murder exactly

1268
01:01:02,335 --> 01:01:04,639
Alex said we're going back to the club look at back

1269
01:01:16,415 --> 01:01:16,927
Illusion

1270
01:01:23,583 --> 01:01:27,679
Oh by the way the Trump campaign

1271
01:01:28,191 --> 01:01:31,519
Colluded with Israel Israel

1272
01:01:31,775 --> 01:01:36,895
What is also illegal

1273
01:01:38,175 --> 01:01:39,455
Oz referencing Hughes

1274
01:01:39,711 --> 01:01:40,479
Assad

1275
01:01:40,735 --> 01:01:43,551
Russia and the good people in our military

1276
01:01:43,807 --> 01:01:45,087
Which everybody

1277
01:01:45,343 --> 01:01:46,111
Because it's so

1278
01:01:46,367 --> 01:01:48,415
Seriously trip has never said that

1279
01:01:48,671 --> 01:01:49,439
Because it's nonsense

1280
01:01:49,951 --> 01:01:50,719
But Alex is

1281
01:01:50,975 --> 01:01:52,255
Pretending

1282
01:01:52,511 --> 01:01:54,047
Estimating R Us

1283
01:01:54,303 --> 01:01:56,351
Narrative

1284
01:01:56,607 --> 01:01:57,119
Piece of the Flint

1285
01:02:09,407 --> 01:02:11,199
Madison Ave

1286
01:02:12,735 --> 01:02:14,783
You are literally up

1287
01:02:15,039 --> 01:02:15,807
Call me

1288
01:02:18,111 --> 01:02:24,255
Call worship each other they're all involved incredible corruption and collusion with Russia

1289
01:02:24,511 --> 01:02:30,655
Immediately Russian Ridge record

1290
01:02:41,407 --> 01:02:43,455
Is going to change that trash

1291
01:02:46,015 --> 01:02:50,367
No that's true I appreciate the apology

1292
01:02:50,879 --> 01:02:52,927
How long do you think it's going to take him to interrupt again

1293
01:02:53,183 --> 01:02:54,975
6 seconds

1294
01:02:56,511 --> 01:02:57,535
Just got done ready

1295
01:02:58,303 --> 01:02:59,583
Credibly

1296
01:03:02,399 --> 01:03:06,239
About

1297
01:03:07,263 --> 01:03:09,311
Incredibly unselfish where

1298
01:03:09,567 --> 01:03:11,871
Nailed it in your writing

1299
01:03:12,639 --> 01:03:14,175
Have you seen how your

1300
01:03:16,223 --> 01:03:19,039
How you're a laughing stock joke

1301
01:03:24,415 --> 01:03:25,183
Susan

1302
01:03:25,439 --> 01:03:27,487
I pulled up the most recent rating

1303
01:03:27,999 --> 01:03:31,839
From adweek for the month of November

1304
01:03:35,679 --> 01:03:36,191
What's going on

1305
01:03:36,447 --> 01:03:37,727
MSNBC

1306
01:03:37,983 --> 01:03:40,031
Has

1307
01:03:40,543 --> 01:03:44,383
MSNBC managed to accomplish a feat this past month that its Rivals could not

1308
01:03:44,639 --> 01:03:45,663
It delivered audio

1309
01:03:45,919 --> 01:03:47,711
It's growth from the presidential

1310
01:03:48,735 --> 01:03:50,527
So no wait

1311
01:03:50,783 --> 01:03:51,295
They

1312
01:03:51,551 --> 01:03:54,879
I have more ratings than they did during the election

1313
01:03:55,391 --> 01:03:57,439
Didn't think it might have something to do with

1314
01:03:57,695 --> 01:03:59,231
A reverse election going on

1315
01:03:59,487 --> 01:04:02,559
President is no longer present

1316
01:04:03,071 --> 01:04:06,399
In November 2017 MSNBC

1317
01:04:07,679 --> 01:04:09,727
It would be lovely if it did

1318
01:04:10,239 --> 01:04:12,031
Progressive

1319
01:04:12,287 --> 01:04:18,431
Right right that's a little I'm reading from the text not at a time

1320
01:04:20,991 --> 01:04:22,271
Receive

1321
01:04:22,527 --> 01:04:23,295
+ 26

1322
01:04:23,807 --> 01:04:25,343
Percent in total primetime.

1323
01:04:25,599 --> 01:04:27,135
10 + 4% in primetime

1324
01:04:28,415 --> 01:04:28,927
Demo

1325
01:04:29,183 --> 01:04:32,255
It was also plus 28% in total day viewers

1326
01:04:32,511 --> 01:04:33,791
And plus 7%

1327
01:04:34,047 --> 01:04:35,327
Demo

1328
01:04:35,583 --> 01:04:36,863
Versus November 20th

1329
01:04:37,631 --> 01:04:38,399
So that's big

1330
01:04:38,911 --> 01:04:41,727
That that's pretty f****** what you talked about in the demo

1331
01:04:41,983 --> 01:04:43,775
That's adults 25 years old

1332
01:04:44,031 --> 01:04:44,799
54 which is what

1333
01:04:45,055 --> 01:04:45,567
Marketers

1334
01:04:46,335 --> 01:04:47,615
Interview as the most

1335
01:04:47,871 --> 01:04:48,383
Call

1336
01:04:48,895 --> 01:04:50,175
Disposable income

1337
01:04:50,687 --> 01:04:52,991
The network was once again led by Rachel Maddow

1338
01:04:53,503 --> 01:04:57,087
The top Progressive voice on cable news posted year-over-year audience

1339
01:04:57,343 --> 01:04:58,111
Growth

1340
01:04:58,367 --> 01:05:00,159
Defeated timeslot rival Sean Hannity

1341
01:05:00,415 --> 01:05:02,207
Advertiser-friendly 1:35

1342
01:05:02,463 --> 01:05:03,231
54 demographic

1343
01:05:05,279 --> 01:05:08,095
I don't care I don't care either but it's literally the

1344
01:05:08,351 --> 01:05:13,215
It is because even Fox News viewers are starting to get like

1345
01:05:13,727 --> 01:05:16,799
Why are you guys talking about The Only Thing Worth

1346
01:05:17,311 --> 01:05:19,615
Why are you telling us a story about

1347
01:05:19,871 --> 01:05:22,431
Whatever Tucker Carlson had for dinner

1348
01:05:22,943 --> 01:05:23,967
Guys

1349
01:05:24,479 --> 01:05:26,015
Present committed crimes at least

1350
01:05:26,271 --> 01:05:32,415
At least lie about it right now doing that

1351
01:05:32,671 --> 01:05:33,695
Think about it

1352
01:05:33,951 --> 01:05:34,463
PC ratings

1353
01:05:35,487 --> 01:05:36,767
There was Morning Joe

1354
01:05:37,791 --> 01:05:40,607
Not only did Joe and Mika finish ahead of new day

1355
01:05:40,863 --> 01:05:41,887
Are there

1356
01:05:42,399 --> 01:05:45,983
But they delivered the most-watched month ever on the network in

1357
01:05:46,239 --> 01:05:47,519
Give me 6 to 9 a.m. slot

1358
01:05:48,031 --> 01:05:50,335
Averaging 1.1 million total viewers

1359
01:05:50,847 --> 01:05:52,127
Gross gross but it's

1360
01:05:52,383 --> 01:05:53,407
Totally spot

1361
01:05:53,663 --> 01:05:58,015
Totally the opposite of what Alex says

1362
01:05:58,271 --> 01:05:59,295
Yeah they're great

1363
01:06:00,575 --> 01:06:01,087
F*** off

1364
01:06:02,111 --> 01:06:04,671
It's not as good ratings as a fox

1365
01:06:04,927 --> 01:06:06,975
Some friends or whatever but that's not going to

1366
01:06:07,231 --> 01:06:08,255
Be well

1367
01:06:08,767 --> 01:06:11,071
Morning racism

1368
01:06:17,471 --> 01:06:18,495
Finger guns

1369
01:06:18,751 --> 01:06:19,519
Those are

1370
01:06:19,775 --> 01:06:21,311
Maybe the dumbest people on the play

1371
01:06:22,591 --> 01:06:23,615
French people

1372
01:06:24,127 --> 01:06:24,895
Staggering and there's two

1373
01:06:27,199 --> 01:06:28,479
They're so bad at what they

1374
01:06:28,991 --> 01:06:30,783
Have no chemistry whatsoever

1375
01:06:31,039 --> 01:06:32,319
Anyway let's get back

1376
01:06:32,575 --> 01:06:35,647
It's like watching a

1377
01:06:35,903 --> 01:06:36,415
PK movie

1378
01:06:36,671 --> 01:06:39,231
Without the commentary just watching that just going like

1379
01:06:39,743 --> 01:06:40,767
Who wrote

1380
01:06:42,303 --> 01:06:43,327
This is so

1381
01:06:43,583 --> 01:06:44,863
Poorly written producer

1382
01:06:46,143 --> 01:06:48,959
Don't you guys have somebody

1383
01:06:50,239 --> 01:06:50,751
Alright

1384
01:06:53,311 --> 01:06:57,151
Under the microscope every movie

1385
01:07:07,903 --> 01:07:08,415
For Shepherd

1386
01:07:08,671 --> 01:07:09,695
Every person ever

1387
01:07:09,951 --> 01:07:15,839
Condos being harassed one that got 25 years and

1388
01:07:18,399 --> 01:07:18,911
Well

1389
01:07:19,167 --> 01:07:21,471
You accidentally just brought up a couple things there in Florida

1390
01:07:23,007 --> 01:07:23,775
To presenting it as

1391
01:07:24,031 --> 01:07:26,079
There's

1392
01:07:26,335 --> 01:07:28,639
Trump's golf members

1393
01:07:29,151 --> 01:07:35,039
But I am also fine with that are the ideas of people are paying for access to him at the club

1394
01:07:35,295 --> 01:07:40,415
Tri-State business

1395
01:07:40,671 --> 01:07:46,047
At a private club that he charges membership

1396
01:07:46,303 --> 01:07:50,399
What they're talking about the ideas by condo sales

1397
01:07:51,167 --> 01:07:53,215
There are multiple a instant

1398
01:07:53,471 --> 01:07:55,007
That you can look into

1399
01:07:55,263 --> 01:07:58,335
People who have mysteriously bought condos way above Market

1400
01:07:58,591 --> 01:08:00,127
Price

1401
01:08:00,383 --> 01:08:01,407
My mom sold them

1402
01:08:01,663 --> 01:08:02,175
2 years later

1403
01:08:03,455 --> 01:08:03,967
People with MS

1404
01:08:04,223 --> 01:08:04,991
Mysterious ties

1405
01:08:05,503 --> 01:08:07,551
To Russian mobs and what have you

1406
01:08:10,879 --> 01:08:13,439
Is that the international money-laundering

1407
01:08:13,951 --> 01:08:15,231
A really small at the big

1408
01:08:15,999 --> 01:08:16,511
You know

1409
01:08:16,767 --> 01:08:19,583
Kind of

1410
01:08:19,839 --> 01:08:24,191
Is harassing golf members and people in condos

1411
01:08:24,447 --> 01:08:25,727
I mean it

1412
01:08:26,239 --> 01:08:29,311
Technically accurate but it's actually unfair so

1413
01:08:30,591 --> 01:08:34,687
Jail for working with turkey

1414
01:08:38,015 --> 01:08:41,343
Microscope and you're so powerful would your little Mueller

1415
01:08:41,599 --> 01:08:47,743
God your unelected preacher that you bet everything on

1416
01:08:49,279 --> 01:08:50,047
Powerful

1417
01:08:59,263 --> 01:09:02,591
And you're just waking them up so keep doing what you're doing you are

1418
01:09:05,151 --> 01:09:07,455
Seems like that was

1419
01:09:10,271 --> 01:09:13,087
Heart but again

1420
01:09:13,343 --> 01:09:17,183
Democrats and Republicans

1421
01:09:17,695 --> 01:09:23,839
Thought maybe you guys have all collectively fail this to an extent so we can agree and disagree

1422
01:09:24,095 --> 01:09:24,607
Simultaneously

1423
01:09:24,863 --> 01:09:25,887
And we can move along

1424
01:09:26,143 --> 01:09:26,655
Cuz I was said

1425
01:09:27,167 --> 01:09:29,471
You got to restart

1426
01:09:31,007 --> 01:09:32,031
You know

1427
01:09:46,623 --> 01:09:48,927
I bet

1428
01:10:05,567 --> 01:10:06,591
Also you should apologize

1429
01:10:10,175 --> 01:10:15,039
She's a family in Jesus name. Just some prop for you to use

1430
01:10:15,295 --> 01:10:17,599
What do you think this is Sandy Hook

1431
01:10:17,855 --> 01:10:21,439
Scarborough

1432
01:10:24,511 --> 01:10:25,023
Someone else's

1433
01:10:25,279 --> 01:10:27,839
Tragic death

1434
01:10:28,095 --> 01:10:34,239
Glasses like his head looks f***** up that's soft but I'd accept

1435
01:10:34,495 --> 01:10:38,335
Really

1436
01:10:38,591 --> 01:10:39,359
What is Soto

1437
01:10:39,615 --> 01:10:40,383
Terrible about Alex

1438
01:10:40,639 --> 01:10:41,151
Beyond

1439
01:10:41,407 --> 01:10:42,431
The lying it's lying

1440
01:10:42,943 --> 01:10:43,455
Cursive cruelty

1441
01:10:43,967 --> 01:10:47,807
But he's a really really cruel person

1442
01:10:48,831 --> 01:10:50,367
You could make better points

1443
01:10:50,623 --> 01:10:52,415
Probably get further with his argument

1444
01:10:52,927 --> 01:10:53,439
If you would

1445
01:10:53,951 --> 01:10:54,463
Go with Subs

1446
01:10:55,231 --> 01:10:56,767
But it wouldn't allow him to be

1447
01:10:57,023 --> 01:10:57,535
Be cruel

1448
01:10:57,791 --> 01:10:58,559
And because

1449
01:10:58,815 --> 01:11:00,095
You love being cruel

1450
01:11:00,607 --> 01:11:01,631
You've got a throw-in

1451
01:11:02,143 --> 01:11:03,167
Bash that girls had in

1452
01:11:03,679 --> 01:11:04,191
Okay

1453
01:11:04,447 --> 01:11:05,471
Ocean's 11 types

1454
01:11:06,239 --> 01:11:07,775
All right here's what we're going to do

1455
01:11:09,311 --> 01:11:11,359
Alex has to go to court or

1456
01:11:11,615 --> 01:11:12,639
Court-ordered therapy

1457
01:11:12,895 --> 01:11:14,175
Be right as part of his

1458
01:11:14,431 --> 01:11:18,783
Divorce out anymore but ye did for a bed probably over

1459
01:11:20,575 --> 01:11:21,087
His therapist

1460
01:11:21,855 --> 01:11:22,367
Then

1461
01:11:22,879 --> 01:11:23,391
You

1462
01:11:23,647 --> 01:11:25,183
Standing as a replacement therapy

1463
01:11:25,695 --> 01:11:26,719
Give him the psychopath test

1464
01:11:27,487 --> 01:11:32,863
Break the you know and you're not beholding to the doctor paper towel

1465
01:11:33,119 --> 01:11:34,655
Write up

1466
01:11:34,911 --> 01:11:39,775
Then we released that he is because

1467
01:11:40,287 --> 01:11:41,055
A f****** course

1468
01:11:44,383 --> 01:11:47,711
We don't need to do that we don't even need to call Mueller

1469
01:11:48,223 --> 01:11:49,759
Just listen to this show is a f******

1470
01:11:50,015 --> 01:11:50,527
Psychopath

1471
01:11:54,879 --> 01:11:56,927
Alex apologize for that interruption

1472
01:11:57,183 --> 01:11:58,975
Let's get back to the clip

1473
01:11:59,231 --> 01:11:59,743
A good long while

1474
01:12:08,703 --> 01:12:13,055
All about the money

1475
01:12:55,807 --> 01:12:57,343
Tell her what you got her hat on

1476
01:12:58,111 --> 01:13:01,183
And show us the birth certificate

1477
01:13:01,439 --> 01:13:01,951
Mr.joe

1478
01:13:02,207 --> 01:13:02,719
.

1479
01:13:02,975 --> 01:13:06,303
Nice try to come up with an insult

1480
01:13:06,559 --> 01:13:08,351
Also I think he's planning on killing

1481
01:13:08,607 --> 01:13:13,727
Is going to go today was Lori klausutis

1482
01:13:13,983 --> 01:13:15,775
You can look that up you can find it

1483
01:13:16,031 --> 01:13:19,359
Joe Scarborough

1484
01:13:19,871 --> 01:13:21,151
18 years ago

1485
01:13:21,663 --> 01:13:23,455
Right I would imagine

1486
01:13:23,711 --> 01:13:24,223
Trump

1487
01:13:25,247 --> 01:13:28,319
Basically

1488
01:13:28,575 --> 01:13:29,855
Being part of a nun

1489
01:13:30,111 --> 01:13:31,135
Solved mystery

1490
01:13:32,415 --> 01:13:35,487
Remember it was fairly recently but he's brought up

1491
01:13:35,743 --> 01:13:37,791
Psycho Joe and stuff like that

1492
01:13:38,047 --> 01:13:43,935
They stop playing ball with him or whatever childhood played out in public

1493
01:13:44,191 --> 01:13:45,215
But be that as it may

1494
01:13:46,239 --> 01:13:49,055
You know what I have a really good reason why Joe Scarborough would not

1495
01:13:50,847 --> 01:13:51,359
Decency

1496
01:13:52,127 --> 01:13:54,175
Cuz he's addressed it already

1497
01:13:54,431 --> 01:13:55,711
There wasn't investigations

1498
01:13:55,967 --> 01:13:57,247
16 years ago when it happened

1499
01:13:57,503 --> 01:14:00,319
Any idea of him now bringing it up and being like

1500
01:14:00,575 --> 01:14:02,623
Her name was Lori klausutis

1501
01:14:02,879 --> 01:14:07,743
Kill her and you can look at the proper block friends disrespectful to her f****** fan

1502
01:14:07,999 --> 01:14:10,559
Yeah the idea that you would bring that up into the public

1503
01:14:10,815 --> 01:14:11,327
Spirit

1504
01:14:11,583 --> 01:14:12,351
Runs the risk of

1505
01:14:12,607 --> 01:14:13,375
3 traumatizing

1506
01:14:13,631 --> 01:14:15,167
A grieving family

1507
01:14:15,423 --> 01:14:16,191
Who's moved on

1508
01:14:16,447 --> 01:14:16,959
With their lives

1509
01:14:17,215 --> 01:14:18,751
But it's still something that would

1510
01:14:19,263 --> 01:14:21,311
Do you want to see your daughter being uses

1511
01:14:21,567 --> 01:14:22,335
The political

1512
01:14:22,591 --> 01:14:23,359
5 chip

1513
01:14:23,871 --> 01:14:24,895
Can be just thrown around

1514
01:14:25,151 --> 01:14:26,175
I'm guessing it's not fun

1515
01:14:26,431 --> 01:14:27,199
That's got to be

1516
01:14:27,455 --> 01:14:27,967
Terrible

1517
01:14:29,759 --> 01:14:30,783
Child but you

1518
01:14:31,039 --> 01:14:32,831
28 years old

1519
01:14:33,087 --> 01:14:37,183
You don't expect to lose your daughter to a tragic accident

1520
01:14:37,951 --> 01:14:38,463
Safety

1521
01:14:38,719 --> 01:14:39,231
Cuz if

1522
01:14:39,487 --> 01:14:41,279
Joe Scarborough brings up her name

1523
01:14:43,071 --> 01:14:44,351
Deathreats that families get

1524
01:14:44,863 --> 01:14:51,007
F***** over

1525
01:14:51,263 --> 01:14:56,127
What happened to Seth rich

1526
01:14:56,383 --> 01:14:59,967
His family or any of the families of Sandy Hook

1527
01:15:00,223 --> 01:15:01,247
It's not real

1528
01:15:01,503 --> 01:15:02,271
Not appropriate

1529
01:15:04,575 --> 01:15:05,599
Yeah

1530
01:15:08,415 --> 01:15:11,487
If somebody died at Infowars yeah that would be an

1531
01:15:11,999 --> 01:15:13,535
In the same way there is one anyone

1532
01:15:13,791 --> 01:15:14,303
Endive

1533
01:15:14,815 --> 01:15:16,095
You probably would have killed them

1534
01:15:16,351 --> 01:15:17,631
Probably

1535
01:15:17,887 --> 01:15:20,703
Solid 6042

1536
01:15:24,031 --> 01:15:25,055
That's it

1537
01:15:25,311 --> 01:15:26,079
Important

1538
01:15:26,335 --> 01:15:27,359
This be distinct

1539
01:15:27,871 --> 01:15:28,383
Language

1540
01:15:28,639 --> 01:15:29,663
Because that implies

1541
01:15:30,943 --> 01:15:32,991
That implies with someone

1542
01:15:33,247 --> 01:15:33,759
Did something

1543
01:15:34,015 --> 01:15:36,575
And a rhythmic heartbeat

1544
01:15:36,831 --> 01:15:38,367
Ended up making her pass out

1545
01:15:38,623 --> 01:15:39,903
Mitigating her head on a desk

1546
01:15:40,671 --> 01:15:41,439
That is

1547
01:15:42,207 --> 01:15:43,487
Not your head bashed in

1548
01:15:43,743 --> 01:15:45,023
Yeah that's f***** up

1549
01:15:45,279 --> 01:15:47,327
I mean she had her heart broken

1550
01:15:48,351 --> 01:15:48,863
Certainly

1551
01:15:50,911 --> 01:15:52,191
Let's move on

1552
01:15:52,447 --> 01:15:53,983
Alex would not restart

1553
01:15:54,239 --> 01:15:56,031
Alex's

1554
01:15:56,543 --> 01:15:57,823
Respect respect

1555
01:16:00,895 --> 01:16:02,431
I can make even more money

1556
01:16:04,223 --> 01:16:05,759
I think they're shocked

1557
01:16:17,535 --> 01:16:23,679
Under the microscope

1558
01:16:32,127 --> 01:16:37,503
White.

1559
01:16:39,807 --> 01:16:42,879
Thundercat

1560
01:16:44,415 --> 01:16:46,975
The rules of Washington

1561
01:16:47,231 --> 01:16:50,047
Side effects

1562
01:16:50,303 --> 01:16:52,863
And colored by the show North bywood Alex

1563
01:17:00,799 --> 01:17:01,311
Thinking

1564
01:17:04,639 --> 01:17:05,663
Banking

1565
01:17:05,919 --> 01:17:06,943
People in Washington

1566
01:17:07,199 --> 01:17:08,223
Which is dumb

1567
01:17:08,479 --> 01:17:14,623
Local Yocal

1568
01:17:16,415 --> 01:17:19,487
That what this show is you heard the music coming on

1569
01:17:19,743 --> 01:17:20,767
And that's why Alex hasn't

1570
01:17:21,023 --> 01:17:22,047
Interrupted

1571
01:17:22,303 --> 01:17:26,655
Set the clock to break

1572
01:17:26,911 --> 01:17:28,703
Is that what Morning Joe is Tara

1573
01:17:28,959 --> 01:17:30,751
Let's get today

1574
01:17:31,519 --> 01:17:33,055
Like they're doing what we're doing

1575
01:17:33,567 --> 01:17:35,359
But for a million billion dollars

1576
01:17:35,871 --> 01:17:39,455
Basically

1577
01:17:40,223 --> 01:17:42,783
They're married you know that weekend Joe got married

1578
01:17:43,039 --> 01:17:47,135
We got married within like the last year

1579
01:17:47,391 --> 01:17:49,951
We're having an affair for quite a while to the last

1580
01:17:52,511 --> 01:17:56,095
And then get opportunity

1581
01:17:56,351 --> 01:17:57,631
Washington d.c.

1582
01:17:57,887 --> 01:18:03,519
Listen to anybody

1583
01:18:04,799 --> 01:18:10,943
They stumbled into one possible crime after another possible crime

1584
01:18:17,855 --> 01:18:21,951
So the black commercial along with it

1585
01:18:23,487 --> 01:18:24,511
Keep drinking

1586
01:18:24,767 --> 01:18:28,095
I think I'm the second one

1587
01:18:29,119 --> 01:18:29,887
Scumbag

1588
01:18:34,495 --> 01:18:36,031
Congressional investigation is

1589
01:18:36,287 --> 01:18:37,823
Is just another public Feud

1590
01:18:38,079 --> 01:18:40,127
Go she ate through

1591
01:18:40,383 --> 01:18:43,199
Savvy PR

1592
01:18:44,479 --> 01:18:45,759
It's the FBI one

1593
01:18:46,015 --> 01:18:47,039
That might matter right

1594
01:18:47,295 --> 01:18:48,063
Let's not Rosie

1595
01:18:48,575 --> 01:18:50,367
The next clip

1596
01:18:50,623 --> 01:18:52,159
Is Alexandra doing a post-mortem

1597
01:18:52,671 --> 01:18:53,439
Cuz he's done interrupt

1598
01:18:57,023 --> 01:18:57,535
12

1599
01:18:57,791 --> 01:18:59,327
2345

1600
01:19:00,607 --> 01:19:01,119
7

1601
01:19:03,679 --> 01:19:04,191
12

1602
01:19:05,727 --> 01:19:11,871
You've got through 35/42

1603
01:19:12,127 --> 01:19:13,407
Did it three times

1604
01:19:13,919 --> 01:19:15,711
Postmortem

1605
01:19:20,831 --> 01:19:23,135
Thursday

1606
01:19:25,183 --> 01:19:25,951
You really think if

1607
01:19:26,207 --> 01:19:26,719
Going to say make a

1608
01:19:28,511 --> 01:19:31,839
Is this is right after

1609
01:19:34,143 --> 01:19:36,959
Is it RuPaul

1610
01:19:45,663 --> 01:19:47,711
Show coming up

1611
01:19:47,967 --> 01:19:49,503
Gives a fake apology

1612
01:19:49,759 --> 01:19:52,063
Topology

1613
01:19:54,111 --> 01:19:56,159
So you cannot make this stuff up

1614
01:20:07,935 --> 01:20:14,080
Representing that even to talk about a metaphorical news of the investigation

1615
01:20:14,336 --> 01:20:16,128
But they're like all they want

1616
01:20:16,384 --> 01:20:17,920
That's you

1617
01:20:19,200 --> 01:20:23,808
We should have our own Morning Show

1618
01:20:26,624 --> 01:20:28,928
They're all going to jail

1619
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:36,352
That why

1620
01:20:37,120 --> 01:20:42,240
National combine

1621
01:20:48,128 --> 01:20:48,896
Tricom

1622
01:20:49,152 --> 01:20:49,664
Jacobs

1623
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:51,200
Borders

1624
01:20:51,712 --> 01:20:55,040
Savage

1625
01:20:55,296 --> 01:20:57,856
How do you even get rid of silverfish

1626
01:20:58,112 --> 01:20:59,648
And then they sit there

1627
01:21:00,416 --> 01:21:01,952
The daughter of a famous

1628
01:21:02,464 --> 01:21:03,488
Evil Lizard

1629
01:21:12,448 --> 01:21:13,216
You got

1630
01:21:14,752 --> 01:21:18,848
Morning show up there

1631
01:21:22,176 --> 01:21:23,456
So all of that stuff is

1632
01:21:23,712 --> 01:21:24,480
True

1633
01:21:24,736 --> 01:21:30,880
I mean you can save Joe Scarborough's a joke that's fine

1634
01:21:31,136 --> 01:21:34,208
Everything you saying about the big new Brzezinski is misrepresenting his writing

1635
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:39,584
What did he

1636
01:21:40,096 --> 01:21:40,608
What

1637
01:21:43,936 --> 01:21:45,984
When you bring it

1638
01:21:46,240 --> 01:21:49,056
URI Geller

1639
01:21:49,824 --> 01:21:53,152
Original Wizard

1640
01:21:53,408 --> 01:21:54,176
Vdi

1641
01:21:54,432 --> 01:21:54,944
Diadora

1642
01:21:57,248 --> 01:21:59,808
Mariza magician

1643
01:22:00,064 --> 01:22:05,696
Jhandu was the guy he was the guy who originally okay he had the big long beard he was the guy who

1644
01:22:07,488 --> 01:22:08,000
The archetype

1645
01:22:08,256 --> 01:22:09,024
Yeah exactly

1646
01:22:09,536 --> 01:22:10,304
I didn't

1647
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:11,328
I didn't get the reference

1648
01:22:11,584 --> 01:22:12,608
I apologize

1649
01:22:13,376 --> 01:22:14,400
Like I don't think John Dewey

1650
01:22:14,656 --> 01:22:15,168
My dad

1651
01:22:15,680 --> 01:22:16,192
Is the right name

1652
01:22:21,056 --> 01:22:26,432
I didn't get the reference

1653
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:33,088
He's talking about Sovereign really talk about is the idea of

1654
01:22:33,344 --> 01:22:33,856
Cooperation

1655
01:22:34,624 --> 01:22:35,392
In a meaningful way

1656
01:22:37,440 --> 01:22:38,720
About the UN

1657
01:22:38,976 --> 01:22:40,000
Control

1658
01:22:40,768 --> 01:22:42,048
Blah blah blah blah blah

1659
01:22:42,304 --> 01:22:44,864
But he's really talking about is we don't have the right to

1660
01:22:45,120 --> 01:22:45,632
Baby cruel anymore

1661
01:22:46,144 --> 01:22:51,008
Cuz we talked about the UN dictating the terms of immigration

1662
01:22:51,264 --> 01:22:52,032
Stuff like that

1663
01:22:52,288 --> 01:22:54,080
And how the US just pulled out of that

1664
01:22:56,128 --> 01:22:58,176
One of the reasons that that existed was

1665
01:22:58,432 --> 01:22:58,944
Because

1666
01:23:02,528 --> 01:23:03,808
There are millions

1667
01:23:04,064 --> 01:23:04,832
The people in Warsaw

1668
01:23:05,088 --> 01:23:05,600
Country is in

1669
01:23:06,112 --> 01:23:09,184
What were the victims of genocide

1670
01:23:09,440 --> 01:23:10,976
He does not mean sovereignty over

1671
01:23:11,232 --> 01:23:13,536
Are countryhumans sovereignty over the rest

1672
01:23:13,792 --> 01:23:19,936
To the world and when I do know about sovereignty for our country but it's never a paw

1673
01:23:20,192 --> 01:23:20,960
Positive sovereign

1674
01:23:21,472 --> 01:23:22,496
Because Alex

1675
01:23:22,752 --> 01:23:24,544
Trump would like to think

1676
01:23:24,800 --> 01:23:25,824
We just need more

1677
01:23:26,080 --> 01:23:26,592
Control

1678
01:23:26,848 --> 01:23:28,128
To be able to be better

1679
01:23:28,896 --> 01:23:32,480
See the thing is we don't like the idea of the UN dictating

1680
01:23:32,736 --> 01:23:35,552
You know that you should take this many immigrants in like

1681
01:23:35,808 --> 01:23:38,880
These are the regions where people are in Peril and what have you

1682
01:23:39,136 --> 01:23:40,672
Don't want to be told that

1683
01:23:40,928 --> 01:23:43,744
They like to present the idea of like we're going to get rid of this

1684
01:23:47,328 --> 01:23:53,472
We're going to get rid of all these regulations and then we're going to do even better for you

1685
01:23:55,008 --> 01:23:55,776
Cleaner because

1686
01:23:56,032 --> 01:24:02,176
You know we have an incentive

1687
01:24:02,432 --> 01:24:03,456
Either really talking about

1688
01:24:03,712 --> 01:24:04,480
Is the sovereign

1689
01:24:05,248 --> 01:24:09,088
F*** off to everybody and we don't care we want you to die

1690
01:24:10,112 --> 01:24:12,160
The sovereignty that is being defended in

1691
01:24:12,416 --> 01:24:13,184
Protected by Alex

1692
01:24:13,440 --> 01:24:14,720
And that's not my sovereign

1693
01:24:15,232 --> 01:24:17,280
My sovereignty does not play that

1694
01:24:18,048 --> 01:24:20,096
The government that hashtag

1695
01:24:21,120 --> 01:24:24,448
Is the power to do

1696
01:24:24,704 --> 01:24:26,496
Things that help everybody

1697
01:24:26,752 --> 01:24:28,032
I'm saved people

1698
01:24:28,288 --> 01:24:30,080
And ideally resolve

1699
01:24:31,104 --> 01:24:33,920
Have not done a great job of that

1700
01:24:38,528 --> 01:24:40,832
Slow cook today even

1701
01:24:41,088 --> 01:24:44,160
He's going to recognize Jerusalem the capital of Israel

1702
01:24:45,952 --> 01:24:48,256
We're moving well into parody

1703
01:24:48,512 --> 01:24:54,656
This is like we're moving beyond whatever why would you do that why would you do that now

1704
01:24:54,912 --> 01:24:58,496
Kind of idiot would tell a sovereign

1705
01:24:59,008 --> 01:25:00,032
Sovereignty

1706
01:25:00,288 --> 01:25:00,800
No

1707
01:25:01,568 --> 01:25:06,176
It's going to just surreal doesn't even really want their capital

1708
01:25:06,432 --> 01:25:07,200
Do you know what the

1709
01:25:13,856 --> 01:25:17,952
No even though f****** Netanyahu publicly is like

1710
01:25:18,208 --> 01:25:20,512
This is a great decision but I'm sure privately

1711
01:25:21,024 --> 01:25:21,536
F******

1712
01:25:21,792 --> 01:25:22,560
We don't need this right

1713
01:25:25,376 --> 01:25:27,424
Not right now are you shiting me

1714
01:25:27,936 --> 01:25:28,448
It's a lot of trouble

1715
01:25:29,984 --> 01:25:31,520
Stupid it's amazing

1716
01:25:31,776 --> 01:25:36,640
What you're doing is your

1717
01:25:36,896 --> 01:25:39,712
Prescribing a lot of people to a very miserable

1718
01:25:40,480 --> 01:25:43,552
Because when you do that what you're doing is you are.

1719
01:25:44,320 --> 01:25:44,832
Wyckoff

1720
01:25:46,368 --> 01:25:47,136
What you're doing is

1721
01:25:47,392 --> 01:25:47,904
Depriving

1722
01:25:48,672 --> 01:25:50,208
Palestinians of a lot of legitimate

1723
01:25:50,976 --> 01:25:52,000
Existence

1724
01:25:52,256 --> 01:25:53,792
Life right right

1725
01:25:54,048 --> 01:25:57,120
To live anywhere and the claims that they have dual ownership

1726
01:25:57,376 --> 01:25:58,144
Roseville

1727
01:25:59,424 --> 01:26:02,496
Did Lance

1728
01:26:04,288 --> 01:26:04,800
Settlements

1729
01:26:05,056 --> 01:26:07,104
You will embolden

1730
01:26:07,360 --> 01:26:07,872
Encroaching on

1731
01:26:10,688 --> 01:26:12,992
What is going to be the end result

1732
01:26:13,248 --> 01:26:14,272
That's the sovereignty

1733
01:26:15,296 --> 01:26:16,576
Desired by a mallet

1734
01:26:17,856 --> 01:26:18,880
And that's not good

1735
01:26:19,136 --> 01:26:20,672
That's not good for the world

1736
01:26:20,928 --> 01:26:22,464
No it's terrible and it's not good

1737
01:26:22,720 --> 01:26:24,000
Bristol still here in safe

1738
01:26:24,256 --> 01:26:25,536
Israel shouldn't exist

1739
01:26:25,792 --> 01:26:27,328
Cuz that's not right either

1740
01:26:28,608 --> 01:26:31,680
It it shouldn't be an apartheid state it's not the like

1741
01:26:31,936 --> 01:26:35,264
What they're doing is wrong that doesn't mean the reverse is right

1742
01:26:38,592 --> 01:26:39,104
Very

1743
01:26:39,616 --> 01:26:43,968
But this is a non-zero-sum game

1744
01:26:44,224 --> 01:26:47,296
I never said treating it like there's only a winner or loser

1745
01:26:47,808 --> 01:26:52,160
And that's why we're Trump is a winner you're a loser

1746
01:26:54,976 --> 01:26:56,000
Do you think they're like

1747
01:26:58,304 --> 01:27:00,608
Is there an argument to be made

1748
01:27:01,120 --> 01:27:02,912
That this is a purely religious

1749
01:27:05,984 --> 01:27:06,752
Oran

1750
01:27:07,008 --> 01:27:09,568
Whoever whomever three exact

1751
01:27:11,104 --> 01:27:15,968
Cuz there's no there's no foreign policy where in this is improving our relations with

1752
01:27:16,224 --> 01:27:16,736
Anybody

1753
01:27:16,992 --> 01:27:18,784
I think you could make the argument

1754
01:27:19,040 --> 01:27:24,928
Services of belligerent religious bulshit decision I think I think you could make that argument but I think there will probably be

1755
01:27:25,184 --> 01:27:25,696
Some people who with

1756
01:27:26,208 --> 01:27:27,744
Like have a foreign policy

1757
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:28,768
Position that would say it

1758
01:27:29,792 --> 01:27:31,584
I just agree with them but I think that there's some people

1759
01:27:31,840 --> 01:27:32,352
Hoodsite

1760
01:27:32,608 --> 01:27:33,120
This place

1761
01:27:33,376 --> 01:27:36,960
Has been you know it's been too long that it's been a source of conflict

1762
01:27:37,472 --> 01:27:38,496
Better to burn it down

1763
01:27:40,800 --> 01:27:41,312
Continue like this

1764
01:27:42,080 --> 01:27:44,128
Could light a fire under it and

1765
01:27:44,640 --> 01:27:45,152
You know what the

1766
01:27:45,408 --> 01:27:47,200
There's going to be a lot of people who get burned but

1767
01:27:48,992 --> 01:27:50,272
So you're you're

1768
01:27:50,528 --> 01:27:51,040
Interpretation

1769
01:27:51,296 --> 01:27:53,856
Can of that

1770
01:27:54,368 --> 01:27:54,880
Okay

1771
01:27:55,136 --> 01:27:57,696
I don't know I'm not I'm not saying that is what motivated me

1772
01:27:58,976 --> 01:27:59,488
Be somebody

1773
01:28:01,280 --> 01:28:03,328
Somebody's arguments

1774
01:28:03,840 --> 01:28:04,864
Yeah let's start some

1775
01:28:07,168 --> 01:28:08,960
Or less I mean it's like

1776
01:28:10,240 --> 01:28:12,544
Building a lot of problems engine

1777
01:28:12,800 --> 01:28:13,312
Knock it down

1778
01:28:13,568 --> 01:28:14,336
BrightStar

1779
01:28:14,592 --> 01:28:18,432
Was trying to fix the problem like in the movie

1780
01:28:24,576 --> 01:28:29,440
What was arrogant

1781
01:28:29,696 --> 01:28:30,976
But it was flyover country

1782
01:28:40,960 --> 01:28:41,984
DC

1783
01:28:42,240 --> 01:28:44,032
So many Trump Towers in Iowa

1784
01:28:44,544 --> 01:28:46,336
Out-of-towner

1785
01:28:49,664 --> 01:28:51,968
Stanley change map to New York

1786
01:28:52,480 --> 01:28:53,248
And kick butt

1787
01:28:59,392 --> 01:29:01,184
And turned around in the witnesses

1788
01:29:04,000 --> 01:29:05,536
A collection of garbage like that

1789
01:29:06,048 --> 01:29:07,328
Alex

1790
01:29:07,584 --> 01:29:09,888
Trump's New York

1791
01:29:11,936 --> 01:29:12,704
His dad was born

1792
01:29:12,960 --> 01:29:13,472
In the Bronx

1793
01:29:13,984 --> 01:29:14,752
Yeah they came out

1794
01:29:15,008 --> 01:29:15,520
Was born in

1795
01:29:15,776 --> 01:29:20,128
New York weather Frederick Trump

1796
01:29:20,384 --> 01:29:22,688
I mean if you want to go to a literal

1797
01:29:23,456 --> 01:29:24,992
I feel like

1798
01:29:27,296 --> 01:29:27,808
You know

1799
01:29:28,064 --> 01:29:31,904
Denying black people the ability to live in your buildings

1800
01:29:32,416 --> 01:29:33,696
Screwing over everybody that

1801
01:29:33,952 --> 01:29:36,000
Contractors

1802
01:29:38,304 --> 01:29:41,888
You know going bankrupt over and over and over again

1803
01:29:42,144 --> 01:29:44,192
Having your daddy Bailey

1804
01:29:44,704 --> 01:29:45,472
Chicken

1805
01:29:45,728 --> 01:29:47,264
Becoming a

1806
01:29:47,520 --> 01:29:51,616
Reality TV show business

1807
01:29:52,128 --> 01:29:57,248
Lying about being a billionaire when in reality your finances are almost certainly trololol

1808
01:29:59,808 --> 01:30:03,392
Being a frontman

1809
01:30:03,648 --> 01:30:06,464
I think those are all the literal interpretation

1810
01:30:06,720 --> 01:30:12,608
But right totally so Trump's Dad was born in the Bronx New York

1811
01:30:12,864 --> 01:30:13,888
Trump's father

1812
01:30:14,144 --> 01:30:15,680
Trump's grandfather

1813
01:30:15,936 --> 01:30:16,960
Frederick Trump was born in

1814
01:30:18,240 --> 01:30:21,312
At a fairly early Elias

1815
01:30:21,568 --> 01:30:22,336
The f****** German

1816
01:30:22,592 --> 01:30:24,640
At a fairly early age

1817
01:30:24,896 --> 01:30:25,920
I believe it

1818
01:30:26,176 --> 01:30:28,992
1617 or so after he

1819
01:30:31,552 --> 01:30:32,576
Children and family

1820
01:30:35,392 --> 01:30:35,904
The family had

1821
01:30:36,160 --> 01:30:36,672
Bavaria

1822
01:30:36,928 --> 01:30:38,720
But Frederick has deemed

1823
01:30:39,488 --> 01:30:40,000
To work

1824
01:30:41,280 --> 01:30:42,304
Wasn't so he became

1825
01:30:42,816 --> 01:30:44,096
You got an apprenticeship at a barber

1826
01:30:44,608 --> 01:30:45,120
Shop

1827
01:30:45,376 --> 01:30:48,448
And it's 16 or so he ran off to the United States

1828
01:30:49,984 --> 01:30:50,496
He said

1829
01:30:50,752 --> 01:30:52,288
But he agreed with his mother that he's

1830
01:30:52,544 --> 01:30:53,312
You should go to America

1831
01:30:53,824 --> 01:30:56,384
However years later family members said that he

1832
01:30:56,640 --> 01:30:57,920
Departed secretly at night

1833
01:30:58,176 --> 01:30:59,200
And left his mother

1834
01:30:59,456 --> 01:31:01,248
A note which is interesting because

1835
01:31:05,856 --> 01:31:06,880
Built into that whole thing

1836
01:31:07,136 --> 01:31:08,672
The time

1837
01:31:10,464 --> 01:31:10,976
Vicki was

1838
01:31:11,744 --> 01:31:12,256
14

1839
01:31:12,512 --> 01:31:13,536
And became an apprentice

1840
01:31:14,048 --> 01:31:15,328
His father died

1841
01:31:15,584 --> 01:31:17,632
And he left a family in severe debt with medical

1842
01:31:19,936 --> 01:31:21,216
Abandoned his mother

1843
01:31:21,728 --> 01:31:24,288
And claimed we made an agreement to go to the United States

1844
01:31:24,800 --> 01:31:28,128
So he came over to United States came over to New York

1845
01:31:30,176 --> 01:31:33,504
Making a bunch of erroneous claims on Gold Rush Lanzar West

1846
01:31:34,016 --> 01:31:34,528
And started

1847
01:31:38,624 --> 01:31:40,160
Ever further back

1848
01:31:40,672 --> 01:31:41,184
Liar

1849
01:31:41,696 --> 01:31:42,976
Liar

1850
01:31:43,232 --> 01:31:46,816
Racist piece of s*** liar

1851
01:31:47,072 --> 01:31:49,120
Started like prostitution

1852
01:31:51,680 --> 01:31:53,472
Yeah it was

1853
01:31:53,728 --> 01:31:54,240
CERN depressed

1854
01:31:55,008 --> 01:31:57,312
Make claims on land

1855
01:32:00,640 --> 01:32:02,176
AMC Woodfield

1856
01:32:02,432 --> 01:32:05,248
Stuff on the lamps build like a like a housing

1857
01:32:07,296 --> 01:32:08,320
In order to

1858
01:32:08,576 --> 01:32:10,368
Cheap minors

1859
01:32:10,624 --> 01:32:15,232
These people will be minding their need somewhere to stay until you charge them

1860
01:32:16,256 --> 01:32:17,024
And on the off-chance

1861
01:32:17,280 --> 01:32:18,816
They found gold he would have

1862
01:32:19,072 --> 01:32:24,704
Place the claim of ownership on all the rare or not to be

1863
01:32:24,960 --> 01:32:26,240
Think it might not have held up

1864
01:32:27,264 --> 01:32:29,568
Displacing people who were in The Gold Rush

1865
01:32:30,080 --> 01:32:30,848
And she'll like that sucks

1866
01:32:31,872 --> 01:32:33,408
But

1867
01:32:33,664 --> 01:32:36,992
Just all the way back he did all that and then he moved to New York

1868
01:32:37,248 --> 01:32:39,296
1C struck it rich

1869
01:32:39,552 --> 01:32:40,320
Please f****** scam

1870
01:32:40,832 --> 01:32:41,600
I meant so

1871
01:32:42,112 --> 01:32:44,928
The trumps have lived in New York ever since that right that's

1872
01:32:45,184 --> 01:32:46,720
Is family didn't come into New York

1873
01:32:46,976 --> 01:32:49,280
Can kick butt these people out west

1874
01:32:49,536 --> 01:32:50,816
And then move to New York

1875
01:32:51,072 --> 01:32:52,352
And started abusing system

1876
01:32:52,608 --> 01:32:54,144
That they've been Frederick at

1877
01:32:54,400 --> 01:32:57,984
Been abusing already

1878
01:32:58,240 --> 01:33:01,824
Move what do you talk about a guy move from Bavaria

1879
01:33:02,080 --> 01:33:02,848
Like what year wheat

1880
01:33:03,360 --> 01:33:04,896
Remove to Bavarian.

1881
01:33:05,152 --> 01:33:07,456
Team left Bavaria

1882
01:33:07,712 --> 01:33:09,760
Trump

1883
01:33:10,272 --> 01:33:12,832
I am not entirely sure I would

1884
01:33:13,088 --> 01:33:14,880
Save it is probably in the neighborhood of a

1885
01:33:17,440 --> 01:33:18,208
1889

1886
01:33:18,720 --> 01:33:19,744
Okay so

1887
01:33:21,024 --> 01:33:21,536
Patch

1888
01:33:22,048 --> 01:33:22,560
Time machine

1889
01:33:22,816 --> 01:33:24,352
1889

1890
01:33:25,120 --> 01:33:25,632
Kill that

1891
01:33:33,056 --> 01:33:36,640
Turn on one time travel trip

1892
01:33:36,896 --> 01:33:37,408
Better idea

1893
01:33:37,664 --> 01:33:38,176

Good person

1897
01:33:45,600 --> 01:33:48,672
Super-rich in Prospect

1898
01:33:50,208 --> 01:33:52,512
Super billionaire

1899
01:33:52,768 --> 01:33:53,280
Immoral

1900
01:33:53,536 --> 01:33:54,048
And not

1901
01:33:54,304 --> 01:33:57,888
To kick black people out of homes

1902
01:33:58,144 --> 01:33:59,168
Exactly

1903
01:34:00,448 --> 01:34:00,960
That sucks

1904
01:34:01,216 --> 01:34:02,496
Kill Hitler

Hot bulshit

1906
01:34:05,824 --> 01:34:06,336
You know

1911
01:34:24,256 --> 01:34:26,048
A friend

1912
01:34:29,632 --> 01:34:30,656
And Morning Joe

1913
01:34:32,704 --> 01:34:34,496
Take a turn from Lord from

1914
01:34:40,384 --> 01:34:41,408

Sure you arrogant narcissist

1916
01:35:02,912 --> 01:35:03,936
You are self

1917
01:35:05,472 --> 01:35:11,616
Play gentlemen Washington

1918
01:35:11,872 --> 01:35:12,384
French

1919
01:35:13,408 --> 01:35:15,200
Your senses are off

1920
01:35:34,912 --> 01:35:39,008
Strong strong

1921
01:35:40,032 --> 01:35:43,104
They're both like horrible footlong tapeworms

1922
01:35:47,456 --> 01:35:50,016
And there just aren't

1923
01:35:53,088 --> 01:35:54,624
Syphilis

1924
01:35:58,976 --> 01:36:01,792

01:36:02,048 --> 01:36:03,072

1926
01:36:05,376 --> 01:36:05,888
Okay

1927
01:36:12,032 --> 01:36:13,056
Gas committed

1928
01:36:14,080 --> 01:36:17,408
They are

1929
01:36:21,760 --> 01:36:26,624
No manners

1930
01:36:26,880 --> 01:36:27,648
Biggest slide

1931
01:36:32,256 --> 01:36:32,768
Idiot

1932
01:36:33,024 --> 01:36:36,864
I can't think of anybody else

1933
01:36:37,120 --> 01:36:43,264
You know what I think I'm going to make contact with some of those folks to get the full dope on you guys

1934
01:37:02,976 --> 01:37:04,512
She thinks she's better than everybody

1935
01:37:16,800 --> 01:37:18,336
Apology

1936
01:37:20,896 --> 01:37:27,040
If you want to wage war against the globalist infowarsstore.com

1937
01:37:32,928 --> 01:37:34,464
360 win win win win win

1938
01:37:38,304 --> 01:37:44,448
So that point he launches into like a 10-minute sales pitch for the new fortified supply.com

1939
01:37:44,704 --> 01:37:46,752
Cars Patriot Point

1940
01:37:47,264 --> 01:37:48,288
Or you can

1941
01:37:48,544 --> 01:37:52,896
Points towards future purchases or so he's not really clear on what it mean

1942
01:37:53,408 --> 01:37:55,968
But yeah that's that at pivot

1943
01:37:56,224 --> 01:37:56,992
That's the payoff

1944
01:37:57,248 --> 01:37:59,040
That's that's

1945
01:37:59,296 --> 01:38:00,832
40 minutes

1946
01:38:01,088 --> 01:38:04,416
Interrupting

1947
01:38:04,928 --> 01:38:08,512
Even we were getting super bored because one of our favorites

1948
01:38:12,608 --> 01:38:13,888
Joe Scarborough

1949
01:38:14,144 --> 01:38:16,704
I don't want to listen to

1950
01:38:16,960 --> 01:38:19,008
So you got that for 40 minutes and then

1951
01:38:19,264 --> 01:38:20,544
Store

1952
01:38:22,592 --> 01:38:23,616
