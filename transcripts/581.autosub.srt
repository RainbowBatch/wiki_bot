1
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:20,736
Damn important I sweat it

2
00:00:20,992 --> 00:00:27,136
I have great respect for knowledge but I'm sick of them posing as you're through the good guy

3
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:56,320
Knowledge fight

4
00:00:56,576 --> 00:00:59,136
Dot-com

5
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:05,536
Everybody sit around and talk a little bit

6
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:07,840
About Alex Jones

7
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:09,888
What's up

8
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:15,520
Jordan is the family of celine's adopted children

9
00:01:15,776 --> 00:01:19,616

10
00:01:20,128 --> 00:01:22,688
Adoption of a snow leopard

11
00:01:22,944 --> 00:01:26,784
Can I always got to snow leopard a baby elephant

12
00:01:28,576 --> 00:01:29,856
That's so good you're going to need

13
00:01:30,112 --> 00:01:33,696
You're going to Sears the problem with animal drops in Tahlequah

14
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:38,560
The problem is all of Alex's animal drop related

15
00:01:38,816 --> 00:01:39,584
Good stuff would be like

16
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:40,608
I killed this.

17
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:46,496
No no no message

18
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:48,288
So I'm very excited about this

19
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:50,080
Extended family that is growing

20
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:51,104
Snow leopard

21
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,152

Scenic Oregon

24
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:08,000
We're going to head up right time to know we were thinking it's really hot here but it wasn't on fire

25

So we're like let's go to where it's on fire you know like like a real one you pick your

26
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,192
Traveling times

Interested

28
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:20,544
Yes to the West Coast

29
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,104
I agree we've been to the West Coast without the Northway

30
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:29,504
Pacific Northwest is a bit different along the north end more south

31
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,528
The West Coast

32
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:31,552
They different

33
00:02:31,808 --> 00:02:33,344
Sort of Wildlife

34
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:39,744
Yeah we're going to go adventures all around the whole place we're going to go to

35
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,560
Are the coast we're going to go we're staying in a treehouse

36
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:48,960
Oh wow the middle of like real unplug that Hamish it like in the middle of nowhere so I'm going to win the whole time

37
00:02:49,216 --> 00:02:52,288
I'm sure about how I don't have all my electronic tools

38
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:57,152
I wish I could play games

39
00:02:57,408 --> 00:02:57,920
But

40
00:02:58,176 --> 00:02:59,712
It's going to be a very exciting it.

41
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:03,552
Yeah if I'm thrilled for you in a little bit jealous cuz you know I like

42

I hope you all have a great time

44
00:03:09,184 --> 00:03:13,792
And unfortunately that leads us into a little bit of a admin base

45
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:15,840
Conversation

46
00:03:16,096 --> 00:03:16,864
Trip of yours

47
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:20,704
Snuck up on me a little pickup

48
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:27,104
Me to time but has a certain way of being that way

49
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:31,200
Wanted to I knew that you were going to go on this trip and I wanted to like record episodes and

50
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:32,480
Advance in order to

51
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:33,248
Make sure that we

52
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:35,296
We keep the ball rolling and what have you but

53
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:37,600
The reality is between

54
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:40,160
My toe surgery and

55
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:41,440
Feeling bad

56
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:42,208
MN

57
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:48,864
Not feeling bad and then I guess what I feel like s*** again been there been

58
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:50,656
For last couple days

59
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:52,448
It's been really difficult so we're just

60
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:53,216
Going to be off

61
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,824
Episode

62
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,384
Some crazy inspiration strikes

63
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,920
And I record

64
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:03,712
Sing with feelings

65
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:04,736
Yes

66
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:06,784
Otherwise

67
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:07,808
Well you're gone

68
00:04:08,064 --> 00:04:12,160
I'm going to be recovering and doing some admin work

69
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,464
Got a couple of iron

70
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:19,839
What time is it I take a Bic lighter to that

71
00:04:24,191 --> 00:04:25,471
In my mind

72
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:27,263
I was thinking more of like

73
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:28,543
An iron used

74
00:04:28,799 --> 00:04:32,127
To flatten your clothes and I'm heating it up with that

75
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:33,407
Cuz it's very efficient

76
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:35,967
With a crack pipe

77
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:39,039
I feel like that's better than cooking heroin in a spoon

78
00:04:39,551 --> 00:04:41,855
I wasn't talking about quitting heroin I was talking about

79
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:43,391
Heating up an iron

80
00:04:43,647 --> 00:04:44,159
Right

81
00:04:44,415 --> 00:04:45,439
I forgot that part

82
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:51,327
Well I've got a lot of heroin

83
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:56,447
Episode to go over

84
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:58,495
And unfortunately it's not

85
00:04:58,751 --> 00:04:59,519
There's not a lot

86
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:05,151
To talk about there's a couple of important themes that I think run through this but I do not have very many clips

87
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:06,943
Because

88
00:05:07,455 --> 00:05:08,223
Luna Lee

89
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:11,039
This is June 3rd 2003

90
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:15,135
Go back in the past cuz Alex has been a little bit disappointing

91
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:18,207
I didn't really have much more to say I don't want it to

92
00:05:18,463 --> 00:05:19,743
Just constantly talk about

93
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:20,511
Disappoint

94
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:26,911
I am covid self I don't do that every single episode

95
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:29,215
Things that I really want to learn more about

96
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:32,799
And you know if I if I have that option in front of me

97
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:34,079
Certainly

98
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:37,151
If I'm also not feeling well I would rather do that then

99
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:40,735
So I went back to this and it's just kind of

100
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:43,807
The boulevard

101
00:05:44,063 --> 00:05:44,831
Check it's not great

102
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:50,207
I'm about an hour and 15 hour and 20 of this 3-hour episode

103
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:52,255
Is Alex interviewing a family

104
00:05:52,767 --> 00:05:55,327
About a situation a medical situation

105
00:05:55,839 --> 00:05:56,351
That makes

106
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:57,887
Almost no sense

107
00:05:58,143 --> 00:05:59,935
It's has to do with

108
00:06:00,447 --> 00:06:03,007
The mother getting a hepatitis test

109
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:03,775
Positive

110
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:07,359
Tested positive hepatitis Shoreham in something had to be done cuz she was giving

111
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:08,639
Birth

112
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:10,175
New Yorker she had a child

113
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:10,943
Better

114
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:13,503
Right and then it turned out it might have been a false

115
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:14,783
Appositive

116
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:16,063
The conspiracy somehow

117
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:17,599
I don't know

118
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:23,487
Most of these stuff that sounds really nefarious about the interview breaks down to

119
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:24,255
One of the

120
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:31,167
One of the reasons it's really difficult is because there's like four people on the line that Alex is starting to look for Mom the dad

121
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:35,519
Grandma and a doctorate is their aunt like you text

122
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:40,383
It's nonsense bad podcast control

123
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:41,407
I couldn't handle it

124
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:43,711
Anything that they say that even

125
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:44,735
Rises

126
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:46,271
To the level of like I don't know

127
00:06:46,527 --> 00:06:47,039
About this

128
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:49,087
Is like one of them says that

129
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:51,903
The nurse said the doctor was like

130
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:53,439
We don't want your money

131
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:56,255
We just want your first born

132
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:01,631
Okay

133
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:08,031
All right guys or bring it back orphan trains to me I heard that

134
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:09,823
I thought well there's better

135
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:13,407
5% chance this is someone making an awful

136
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:17,759
Awful joke that's about 95% chance

137
00:07:18,015 --> 00:07:19,039
This was misheard

138
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:23,391
I'm saying we don't want your money we want your firstborn child to be healthy

139
00:07:25,183 --> 00:07:26,207
To be alive

140
00:07:26,463 --> 00:07:28,767
Yeah we're focused on the health outcome

141
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:35,167
The money's not what's best for your child. We're not trying to get rich off your

142
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:39,263
Keep circling around this and Alex

143
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:40,543
Keeps pointing it out and I was

144
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:41,823
Listening to it

145
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:43,871
Does just

146
00:07:44,127 --> 00:07:44,895
Nothing

147
00:07:45,407 --> 00:07:46,431
That's brutal

148
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:48,223

00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:05,951
Cover band how was it they were still like a unit

188
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:06,975
I thought they were all dead

189
00:10:07,487 --> 00:10:11,327
No dresses like a TV director now

190
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:13,119
Sebring nobody directed an episode of House

191
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:16,191
Exactly that's all I know

192
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:18,751
He also directed that movie with Ice Cube

193
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:21,055
Where there's a young girl who played football

194
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:26,431
Are we there yet are we there yet to still not there

195
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:27,967
Bush

196
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:34,367
Bushes on their lineup Gavin Rossdale bush

197
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:39,743
He was great and Constantine that really launched his acting career

198
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:40,767
He was not great

199
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:47,167
Yeah it's Luda Ludacris pressure off his appearances

200
00:10:47,423 --> 00:10:51,007
Van Luna has fallen far as he's co-headlining with bush

201
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:51,775
I don't think

202
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:57,919
You still headlining a couple love couple of rolls down

203
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:00,479
Cool

204
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:06,879
This plug may have not gone exactly as intended

205
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:10,207
You're already

206
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:10,975
Are you going

207
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:14,303
Jordan

208
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:18,399
Yes here we are

209
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:21,983
Sort of prevailing narrative that goes throughout the large

210
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:24,799
It's part of the show is about Eric Rudolph

211
00:11:25,055 --> 00:11:29,151
Who do not remember him I remember the name I don't remember exactly what he did

212
00:11:29,407 --> 00:11:32,735
He was the guy who was the actual bomber at the

213
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:39,135
Is it windy yeah yeah people remember

214
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:39,903
Is he was the first

215
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:41,439
Suspect

216
00:11:41,695 --> 00:11:42,207
Right

217
00:11:42,463 --> 00:11:45,535
Had a terrible time with that Missouri unfair

218
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:46,815
Really breathable

219
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:47,839
But

220
00:11:48,095 --> 00:11:50,655
Eric Rudolph is the actual person

221
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:51,423
Fast

222
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:55,263
Ideas that were fairly similar to Alex

223
00:11:55,519 --> 00:12:01,151
Hey did I do recall around this time many bombers had very similar ideas to Ally

224
00:12:01,407 --> 00:12:02,943
Like this

225
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:06,271
Conversation surrounding Eric Rudolph is happening

226
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:08,063
Depressed

227
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:08,831
And

228
00:12:09,343 --> 00:12:10,367
Alex is not very happy about

229
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:11,647
Because

230
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:13,183
Now they're pointing out

231
00:12:13,439 --> 00:12:14,463
It's Eric Rudolph

232
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:16,255
Is somebody who has a lot of ties

233
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:18,815
Do Christian identity type group Sunday

234
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:19,839
Seem to be the

235
00:12:20,095 --> 00:12:21,119
The kind of beliefs

236
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:22,655
We're motivating is

237
00:12:22,911 --> 00:12:23,679
Is Bob

238
00:12:23,935 --> 00:12:30,079
Yeah well you know it's good cuz we saw it we saw the real problem that it was going to be we address

239
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:34,431
Rested and we focused on Outreach efforts and education and now we don't have to

240
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:35,199
To deal with this type

241
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:36,479
Anymore right

242
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:42,367
Do you have to remember is that Eric Rudolph didn't just set off the bomb at Olympic Park

243
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:45,695
There was also multiple bombings of

244
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:46,463
Pain clinics

245
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:47,231
And

246
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:49,279
A gay bar

247
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:51,327
Fat people weigh with multiple

248
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:53,631
Yes he had committed other bombing

249
00:12:53,887 --> 00:12:55,423
Things to this

250
00:12:55,679 --> 00:12:58,751
Charge of everything

251
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:03,103
Those are other things that are indicative of the reason

252
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:04,639
Vicki did the things he did

253
00:13:04,895 --> 00:13:06,943
And even the Olympic bomber

254
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:07,967
Mine was motivated

255
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:15,903
Well that's definitely a piece of it but it is more

256
00:13:16,159 --> 00:13:16,671
Auntie abortion

257
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:17,695
Active

258
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:19,231
The targets are the

259
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:23,583
Sure if you read his confession guest

260
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:29,983
Socialist cultural mixing that goes into the Olympics I wanted to end

261
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:31,519
Embarrass them

262
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:33,055
Yep to there's a bit of that

263
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:34,847
Alex has decided that

264
00:13:35,103 --> 00:13:35,615
He's innocent

265
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:39,455
And

266
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:42,783
He talks a little bit about Christian identity

267
00:13:43,295 --> 00:13:44,063
This clip

268
00:13:44,319 --> 00:13:48,159
And I find his awareness and non awareness of things

269
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:49,183
Possible

270
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:51,231
Tacoma existing human brain

271
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:03,775
Rudolph

272
00:14:04,287 --> 00:14:05,823
I have carried all of this

273
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:12,991
Terrorism

274
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:22,719
Perhaps

275
00:14:41,663 --> 00:14:43,967
Christ

276
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:47,295
Vaccination

277
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:56,511
Now I'm in a green with a parent

278
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:00,351
British Israeli

279
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:05,983
From

280
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:09,311
Babylon

281
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:11,615
Information

282
00:15:23,391 --> 00:15:23,903
I want you to call

283
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:25,951
Call medieval

284
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:33,375
I wouldn't if I were you as well

285
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:37,471
First of all Eric Rudolph totally did the Atlanta Olympics bomb

286
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:42,335
People are guilty to the crime along with multiple other bombings which were inspired mostly by his office

287
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:43,103
Cuz I can do abortion

288
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:50,015
There were very strong indications that Rudolph was a follower of the Christian identity movement in touch with Affiliated militant

289
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:51,295
Groups like the army of God

290
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:53,343
This doesn't seem like a big

291
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:55,391
Stretch even if you are only judge

292
00:15:55,647 --> 00:15:56,415
Judging from his own state

293
00:15:57,695 --> 00:15:59,231
That said I find this fascinating

294
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:03,327
Alex simultaneously is totally aware of British is realism in

295
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:04,607
Totally lying

296
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:05,887
What it is

297
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:12,031
Admits to wake up with this in the past episode you made it to listening to an admiring David Jay Smith

298
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:15,103
Yep on the radio through his younger years which would be impossible

299
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:18,943
If he thinks that the description he just gave a British his realism is correct

300
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:20,223
It's just not

301
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:20,991
Possible

302
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:22,271
Bizarre

303
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:24,575
This is definitely an instant of Alex making a

304
00:16:24,831 --> 00:16:28,671
Deconstruct the beliefs of Christian identity communities because if

305
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:29,695
She did so there be

306
00:16:29,951 --> 00:16:31,743
Declaring overlap with his own blade

307
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:37,119
Desperately doesn't want to engage with the similarities between himself and someone like Eric Rudolph

308
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:38,399
Because ultimately

309
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:45,055
Eric Rudolph was bombing the Olympics and reproductive health clinics but he was also in the process pointing a finger

310
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:46,079
People like Ali

311
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:47,871
From his confession

312
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:54,527
Quote those who call themselves pro-life and who claimed that abortion is murder and that those who use Force to prevent Adorn

313
00:16:54,783 --> 00:16:57,087
We're just as morally reprehensible as the abortionist

314
00:16:57,599 --> 00:17:01,695
For these I have nothing to say other than that you are liars Hypocrites and cowards

315
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:06,303
There's no more fundamental Duty for a moral citizen to protect the innocent from assault

316
00:17:06,815 --> 00:17:09,375
That is inherent in the values of all higher civilization

317
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:12,447
You have the right the responsibility and the duty to come

318
00:17:12,703 --> 00:17:15,263
The defense of the inside when the innocent are under assault

319
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:16,031
Would you protect

320
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:17,823
Your children from the clutches of a murderer

321
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,103
Would you protect your neighbors

322
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:24,479
If you answered yes to both of these then you must support the use of force

323
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:25,247
I've just

324
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:26,271
Justified in attempting

325
00:17:26,527 --> 00:17:27,807
Prevent the murder that is a Porsche

326
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:31,391
Very straightforward

327
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:32,927
Direct

328
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:35,487
I mean

329
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:41,887
Event they're all a bunch of Hypocrites and he's already or he's arguing that it is a moral necessity to support violin

330
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:43,935
In the service of

331
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:45,471
Opposing abortion

332
00:17:45,727 --> 00:17:48,031
I suppose if you are

333
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:50,079
I mean yeah

334
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:51,871
If you are accepting that

335
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:52,895
Their logic

336
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:54,943
Is abortion is murder

337
00:17:55,455 --> 00:17:58,271
And that Alex is right when he says we murdered

338
00:17:58,527 --> 00:18:04,415
Millions of babies or whatever the brought the wrath of Satan the Promenade

339
00:18:05,695 --> 00:18:07,999
I don't see how you can't follow that logic

340
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:13,631
Through and he's right if you do believe that and you don't do anything then you're a coward in it

341
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:19,007
Cuz it's not true I can disagree with Eric Rudolph

342
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:20,031
Alex

343
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:22,847
Alex

344
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:23,615
Difficult

345
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:27,455
Line to walk if he wants to disagree with what this guy is putting

346
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:30,783
They believe they agree in substance

347
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:34,111
And Alex's rhetoric implies

348
00:18:34,623 --> 00:18:36,159
What Eric Rudolph believe

349
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:38,463
Robin Alex Cantone the

350
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:43,071
Conclusion of his own position I mean imagine Alex

351
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:44,351
He did this in his

352
00:18:44,607 --> 00:18:46,655
Thanks because we were bored too many babies

353
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:50,239
Just like how yesterday I said we've aborted too many baby

354
00:18:51,007 --> 00:18:51,519
Yeah

355
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:52,543
Eric Rudolph

356
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:56,895
Confession is essentially a call to Arms to the violence against

357
00:18:57,151 --> 00:18:58,687
The government that he feels as illegitimate

358
00:18:58,943 --> 00:18:59,967
Largely because of the fact

359
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:00,991
Abortion is legal

360
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:02,015
Another quote from

361
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:02,783
Miss confession

362
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:08,671
Quote 225 years ago our ancestors overthrew their government because they were not being represented

363
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:09,951
For purposes of Taxation

364
00:19:10,463 --> 00:19:11,743
Tell me you good Patriots

365
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:13,023
The casus belli of

366
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:15,327
Taxation without representation more weighty

367
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:17,887
Then the deliberate murder of 50 million people

368
00:19:18,143 --> 00:19:20,191
You lie and your lies will find you

369
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:25,055
That's a directed call out at people like Alex who you talk of extremism

370
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:28,639
How to make money but don't support the cause enough to do actual extremism

371
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:31,711
Someone like Alex doesn't have a good rebuttal to that argument

372
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:34,783
To the best thing to do is to insist that Rudolph must be a patsy

373
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:36,319
It doesn't matter that he can

374
00:19:36,575 --> 00:19:42,719
Investing explained his actions in detail it's because they all turned it was a threat to Alex's self-image

375
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:43,743
Crusading

376
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:45,279
Hero of the right-wing

377
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:47,327
It's tough it's tough

378
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:53,471
Whenever terrorism happens and you are the person who's like man terrorism to really happen but I don't want

379
00:19:54,239 --> 00:19:56,543
Terrible I don't want anybody get hurt

380
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:58,847
I mean obviously the only prescription is Terrorism

381
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:00,639
But I don't want anybody to go

382
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:02,175
Get hurt cuz I'm a good person

383
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:03,711
You should hurt

384
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:06,015
It's it's

385
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:08,831
It's tough to Foster the ecosystem

386
00:20:09,343 --> 00:20:09,855
Create

387
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:12,415
And perpetuates events like this

388
00:20:13,183 --> 00:20:14,463
Because in order to do it

389
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:15,999
You have to denounce

390
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:19,071
The actual things that you can actually denounce them

391
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:21,375
Yeah I'm have to rewrite them as fake

392
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:22,143
In order

393
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:24,191
To be like well yeah people should be

394
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:27,007
Blowing up a board we would never do that

395
00:20:27,263 --> 00:20:29,055
We would never do that

396
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:33,407
The fact that this guy did that is evidence that he was probably the Fed

397
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:34,431
Right right

398
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:40,063
That's that's funny I do I just realized now that the right-wing probably does

399
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:42,111
Feel a little jealousy towards Isis

400
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:44,671
You know cuz they just get to come out and be like hey

401
00:20:45,183 --> 00:20:46,719
Wheel of terrorism they don't have

402
00:20:46,975 --> 00:20:49,023
How to play the game of being like terrorism is bad

403
00:20:49,535 --> 00:20:50,047
Deal with it

404
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:55,679
You know they don't get to have as much fun now it's have to work twice as hard

405
00:20:56,191 --> 00:21:00,031
Difficult line to walk with this stuff

406
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:01,311
With the Eric Rudolph

407
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:03,103
But even Beyond like that

408
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:06,175
Dumb game that he's trying to play he's also just like

409
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:07,199
Straight up lying

410
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:10,783
Like here is him like this is from the clip we just listen to but just the sex

411
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:12,831
Actuaries pretending to read a headline

412
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:29,984
Perhaps

413
00:21:31,264 --> 00:21:33,312
How much is a do you think is the actual headline

414
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:36,128
Based on the tone of voice he's using

415
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:38,944
It sounds like all of that is from the article right but it's

416
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:42,016
Just got to just be is Terrorism tied to religious sect

417
00:21:43,296 --> 00:21:46,624
Editorializing

418
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:47,392
It's part of that

419
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:52,256
Yeah why would the new why would the Washington Post be like maybe we should ban this Christian sect

420
00:21:52,512 --> 00:21:54,048
You know the thing we can do

421
00:21:56,096 --> 00:21:57,632
Not enshrined in the f******

422
00:21:57,888 --> 00:22:01,984
Teen Constitution there is no suggestion at any point the Christian identity should be banned

423
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:05,056
And all of that is just Alex creating a more exciting story to distract

424
00:22:05,312 --> 00:22:06,336
The main point of this article

425
00:22:07,104 --> 00:22:09,920
Which is that Eric Rudolph did in fact have ties to Christian idem

426
00:22:10,176 --> 00:22:12,224
Groups and it seems very likely that is act

427
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,248
Terrorism or at least

428
00:22:13,504 --> 00:22:15,552
Partially inspired by his religious beliefs

429
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:19,904
There's a nice quote from Idaho State University sociology professor

430
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:21,696
Sir James Auto in this article

431
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:27,328
I would prefer to say that Rudolph is a religiously inspired terrorist because most mainstream Christian

432
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:30,400
Translate consider Christian identity to be a heresy Ajo said

433
00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:35,008
Christian take on bridge of the juxtaposition of the words Christian and terrorists he added

434
00:22:35,264 --> 00:22:40,128
That may give them some idea of how Muslims feel when they constantly hear the term Islamic terrorism

435
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,152
Especially sense

436
00:22:41,408 --> 00:22:42,432
September 11th

437
00:22:42,688 --> 00:22:44,992
I refuse

438
00:22:50,112 --> 00:22:51,648
So Alex just has this whole life

439
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:52,672
A problem with

440
00:22:52,928 --> 00:22:54,464
The idea that the

441
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:58,304
The term Christian is being associated in any way with

442
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:00,096
A potentially

443
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:04,192
Christian religiously-motivated extremist group

444
00:23:04,448 --> 00:23:05,472
The good name

445
00:23:05,728 --> 00:23:07,520
Of a peaceful religion

446
00:23:07,776 --> 00:23:09,056
That has never

447
00:23:09,312 --> 00:23:14,176
At any point in time engaged in random or raw acts of terrorism

448
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:15,968
Towards any people

449
00:23:16,224 --> 00:23:16,736
Okay

450
00:23:17,248 --> 00:23:18,016
So

451
00:23:18,528 --> 00:23:20,576
Alex gets a little bit weird here cuz

452
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:21,600
He has to

453
00:23:21,856 --> 00:23:24,160
Deal with the existence of Christian identity

454
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:24,928
Rather thing

455
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:27,488
Because it's part of the story that he

456
00:23:27,744 --> 00:23:29,536
He's decided to cover and he's reading this

457
00:23:29,792 --> 00:23:31,072
Washington Post article

458
00:23:31,584 --> 00:23:35,424
Maybe because he thinks he's going to get to a point where it says let's ban religion

459
00:23:35,936 --> 00:23:36,448
Doesn't

460
00:23:37,984 --> 00:23:39,520
In doing so he ends up

461
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:42,080
Having to address the fact that

462
00:23:43,104 --> 00:23:44,384
Christian identity adherents

463
00:23:45,152 --> 00:23:45,664
Do

464
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:47,456
Generally believe

465
00:23:47,712 --> 00:23:49,504
That white people are superior

466
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:52,064
For sure he has to be like

467
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:52,832
Why do wrong

468
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:56,160
This isn't great

469
00:24:05,888 --> 00:24:06,656
European White

470
00:24:18,432 --> 00:24:20,480
I mean, the army of God

471
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,304
Is it racist

472
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:07,584
Holyshit

473
00:25:08,352 --> 00:25:10,912
Well that's weird

474
00:25:11,168 --> 00:25:11,680
Yeah

475
00:25:12,192 --> 00:25:18,336
I think he accidentally made a fairly cogent argument for the problem actually being people

476
00:25:18,592 --> 00:25:24,736
Calling themselves

477
00:25:25,248 --> 00:25:26,528
I think there is a religious

478
00:25:26,784 --> 00:25:28,320
Tradition Within

479
00:25:28,576 --> 00:25:29,088
Judaism

480
00:25:29,344 --> 00:25:34,464
Of God's chosen people. Denote or imply to a Supremacy

481
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:38,304
And I think that that is something else they have to sort of removed from the conversation

482
00:25:38,816 --> 00:25:39,584
Wendy's

483
00:25:40,352 --> 00:25:41,888
These Notions are being used

484
00:25:42,144 --> 00:25:42,656
As

485
00:25:42,912 --> 00:25:44,192
Something to gain

486
00:25:45,472 --> 00:25:46,752
Something for a community

487
00:25:48,032 --> 00:25:48,800
Supremacy

488
00:25:49,824 --> 00:25:50,848
It's not it's not an issue

489
00:25:51,104 --> 00:25:53,920
It is an issue when it comes to

490
00:25:54,176 --> 00:25:55,200
Supremacist ideology

491
00:25:56,736 --> 00:26:02,880
Of the big groups that you're there are some black supremacist groups and I think that you can calls I racist

492
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,232
I think the supremacy part right

493
00:26:07,488 --> 00:26:10,560
Muddy that water is silly

494
00:26:10,816 --> 00:26:11,328
I meant

495
00:26:11,584 --> 00:26:12,352
Secondly

496
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,656
Using this argument

497
00:26:14,912 --> 00:26:15,936
Only serves

498
00:26:16,192 --> 00:26:17,728
The purpose that Alex is driving towards

499
00:26:17,984 --> 00:26:18,496
And that is

500
00:26:18,752 --> 00:26:19,264
2

501
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,032
Make what

502
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:26,432
Supremacy okay everybody is a supremacist for their own

503
00:26:26,688 --> 00:26:27,456
Group

504
00:26:27,968 --> 00:26:28,480
Vines

505
00:26:28,736 --> 00:26:30,016
Problem is that

506
00:26:30,272 --> 00:26:31,808
People are judgmental towards

507
00:26:32,064 --> 00:26:32,832
Other groups

508
00:26:33,344 --> 00:26:34,368
And not themselves

509
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:35,648
Wait

510
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,184
That is the problem

511
00:26:37,952 --> 00:26:43,584
It's a little strange position to be like white supremacy is fine because these others

512
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:44,352
Supremacist groups

513
00:26:44,608 --> 00:26:45,120
Exist

514
00:26:45,632 --> 00:26:46,400
I would say we could flip

515
00:26:46,656 --> 00:26:52,800
This argument and be like no white supremacy is not okay because it is one of the groups that is like all these other groups also

516
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:54,336
Are not great

517
00:26:55,104 --> 00:26:56,128
I don't know I would

518
00:26:56,384 --> 00:26:56,896
Seems like

519
00:26:57,152 --> 00:26:57,920
That would be more with

520
00:26:58,176 --> 00:27:04,320
He wanted to he likes people who bleed red blood he loves everybody

521
00:27:04,576 --> 00:27:07,392
Same moral argument is somebody who's like

522
00:27:07,904 --> 00:27:08,928
Yeah

523
00:27:09,184 --> 00:27:10,720
I just stole that guy's car

524
00:27:11,488 --> 00:27:12,256
Everybody stealing

525
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,560
That guy stole cars

526
00:27:14,816 --> 00:27:16,096
Why don't you go bother that guy

527
00:27:16,352 --> 00:27:16,864
Right

528
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,656
F*** you I'm a car thief

529
00:27:18,912 --> 00:27:20,448
And I'm better at it like

530
00:27:20,704 --> 00:27:21,216
Define

531
00:27:21,472 --> 00:27:23,520
Okay great

532
00:27:24,032 --> 00:27:28,640
That one could argue that maybe Alex just doesn't know all that much about what these people believe

533
00:27:28,896 --> 00:27:29,408
Doubtful

534
00:27:29,664 --> 00:27:34,016
Yeah especially because he goes on to talk about how he hangs out on racist message

535
00:27:56,032 --> 00:27:56,800
Taco Bell

536
00:28:05,504 --> 00:28:06,016
Group outfits

537
00:28:06,272 --> 00:28:07,552
Wow

538
00:28:08,832 --> 00:28:11,136
Listen listen

539
00:28:11,904 --> 00:28:12,416
What

540
00:28:12,672 --> 00:28:13,440
That's like three Bob

541
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,072
People of John 10 bombings this is the best group out there

542
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,008
Very strange

543
00:28:28,288 --> 00:28:30,336
Serial bomber

544
00:28:30,592 --> 00:28:31,872
Say

545
00:28:32,384 --> 00:28:34,176
I would say

546
00:28:34,944 --> 00:28:35,456
In this

547
00:28:35,712 --> 00:28:38,272
Territory for a defense drink trouble

548
00:28:38,528 --> 00:28:39,552
This isn't good

549
00:28:41,856 --> 00:28:42,368
What year

550
00:28:42,624 --> 00:28:43,904
Comparing terrorist groups

551
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:44,928
I'm being like

552
00:28:45,696 --> 00:28:46,720
Hey this one

553
00:28:47,232 --> 00:28:47,744
Less

554
00:28:48,512 --> 00:28:49,792
Effective worship

555
00:28:51,072 --> 00:28:57,216
These look these guys are so tame some people they bomb a whole building think about the room

556
00:28:57,728 --> 00:29:00,288
It's not a big deal time on

557
00:29:00,544 --> 00:29:02,080
The you know places where

558
00:29:02,336 --> 00:29:02,848
Virulent

559
00:29:03,104 --> 00:29:04,384
Hateful groups

560
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,944
Commute to get together and they they

561
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,736
Discuss things and I got to say

562
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:10,016
The one that happen

563
00:29:10,272 --> 00:29:12,064
To align with my belief system

564
00:29:12,832 --> 00:29:14,624
Is probably the best of them

565
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:19,744
Works like that at the end of the day a lot of

566
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:20,768
People think they're the chosen

567
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:24,864
Microbe happens to be the best

568
00:29:25,632 --> 00:29:30,240
So Alex has decided that Richard Jewell

569
00:29:30,496 --> 00:29:32,032
Cgroups are still White

570
00:29:32,288 --> 00:29:32,800
Supremacist

571
00:29:33,568 --> 00:29:35,104
Like their white supremacist

572
00:29:35,872 --> 00:29:37,920
Are even better at being white supremacist

573
00:29:38,688 --> 00:29:39,968
Then other people are being

574
00:29:40,736 --> 00:29:41,248
Other surprise

575
00:29:42,784 --> 00:29:43,552
It seems to

576
00:29:44,064 --> 00:29:45,088
Make sense attract

577
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:48,928
Alex believes that Richard Jewell was set up

578
00:29:49,184 --> 00:29:51,232
What are the you was a Fall Guy

579
00:29:51,488 --> 00:29:52,000
Because

580
00:29:52,256 --> 00:29:52,768
He was getting

581
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:56,608
Too close to uncovering the plot by the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms

582
00:29:57,888 --> 00:29:58,656
I don't think this is

583
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:43,712
Alex is no evidence that he provides to support his claim that Richard Jewell was blamed because he was getting too close to uncovering the eight

584
00:30:43,968 --> 00:30:44,480
ATF

585
00:30:44,992 --> 00:30:46,528
Conspiracy behind the bombing that's just

586
00:30:46,784 --> 00:30:48,320
Trip from his imagination. Are you

587
00:30:48,576 --> 00:30:49,088
Give a s***

588
00:30:49,344 --> 00:30:52,672
However if you could really see Alex doing his job which

589
00:30:52,928 --> 00:30:54,208
Has to do whatever he can to profit

590
00:30:54,464 --> 00:30:54,976
From tragedy

591
00:30:55,488 --> 00:31:00,096
Rudolfo super clear about his motivation and Salvatore to believe it that would be challenging

592
00:31:00,352 --> 00:31:01,376
For him to cover

593
00:31:01,888 --> 00:31:03,424
In order for this to be marketable for Alex

594
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:04,192
Lexi needs to make

595
00:31:04,448 --> 00:31:04,960
It's a false flag

596
00:31:05,216 --> 00:31:07,520
You can see him shamelessly do exactly that here

597
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:10,592
Rudolph was motivated by an extreme anti-abortion position

598
00:31:10,848 --> 00:31:14,176
The story to be that the feds are worried about

599
00:31:14,432 --> 00:31:15,456
Anti-abortion activist

600
00:31:15,968 --> 00:31:22,112
So the makeup is demonized and no matter what the news ever says and no matter what he himself ever

601
00:31:22,368 --> 00:31:22,880
Versailles

602
00:31:23,136 --> 00:31:25,952
You can't believe that it cannot be in any way

603
00:31:26,208 --> 00:31:28,768
Disqualifying of whatever my assessment of this is

604
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:30,560
Because he was probably tortured

605
00:31:31,072 --> 00:31:33,632
And everybody makes up everything anyway

606
00:31:33,888 --> 00:31:35,936
Yeah it's a dumb

607
00:31:36,192 --> 00:31:36,704
It's really dumb

608
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:37,472
Yeah

609
00:31:37,984 --> 00:31:38,496
Yeah

610
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:40,288
That's frustrating

611
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:43,360
And it's frustrating again on a level of like

612
00:31:44,896 --> 00:31:49,760
Man if we didn't have that f****** torture memo we wouldn't be tossing around torture is being

613
00:31:50,016 --> 00:31:51,040
I'm fine all the goddamn time

614
00:31:51,296 --> 00:31:52,064
Time you know like that

615
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:55,392
That's also something that when you go back and listen to that I'm like

616
00:31:55,904 --> 00:31:58,464
F*** you you lying piece of s*** in at the same time I'm

617
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:01,024
Taking back to 2003 listening to

618
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:01,792
People be like

619
00:32:02,048 --> 00:32:03,584
I think if you get the information

620
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:04,608
Orchard Supply

621
00:32:04,864 --> 00:32:06,656
That was a conversation

622
00:32:06,912 --> 00:32:08,192
Yeah like all the time

623
00:32:08,448 --> 00:32:12,544
Yeah and it's like how and so if you if you hear that

624
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:14,848
Somebody like relying on that

625
00:32:15,104 --> 00:32:16,128
Kind of emotion of like

626
00:32:16,384 --> 00:32:17,664
They're going to torture the dude

627
00:32:18,176 --> 00:32:20,736
Very easy to get overcome with that part because

628
00:32:20,992 --> 00:32:22,784
People are saying around you all day

629
00:32:24,832 --> 00:32:28,672
Yeah and I think Alex B uses those kind of Appeals

630
00:32:29,184 --> 00:32:31,488
For his arguments that are are

631
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:32,768
If it's clunky

632
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:36,352
What does a disservice to the real conversation about how

633
00:32:36,608 --> 00:32:39,168
Bad torture

634
00:32:39,424 --> 00:32:40,448
I totally use it at

635
00:32:40,704 --> 00:32:41,728
The prop a little bit

636
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:46,080
Yeah it's it's a real you know like normally when he

637
00:32:46,336 --> 00:32:47,360
He's jangling keys

638
00:32:47,616 --> 00:32:48,384
Most of the time

639
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,432
He's just made up the keys over here there

640
00:32:50,688 --> 00:32:53,248
They're plastic and a bottom from a stolen from a child

641
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:56,832
This time he is jangling keys but that keys

642
00:32:57,088 --> 00:32:58,368
F****** huge you know

643
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,672
That's a real goddamn set of keys

644
00:33:00,928 --> 00:33:05,280
Yeah but it is also a key that doesn't go to this lockdown by solutely.

645
00:33:05,536 --> 00:33:06,048
So

646
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:09,120
As far away from himself as you can

647
00:33:09,376 --> 00:33:13,472
Go look at those over there don't look at the hell all my friends bomb people

648
00:33:13,728 --> 00:33:14,752
Tell Alex

649
00:33:16,288 --> 00:33:16,800
Bringing up

650
00:33:17,056 --> 00:33:18,080
This one scene

651
00:33:18,592 --> 00:33:22,688
From Fillmore road to tyranny 911

652
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:25,504
And it just got annoying at a certain point

653
00:33:26,272 --> 00:33:26,784
Bring it up

654
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:39,072
Yep

655
00:33:42,656 --> 00:33:43,680
Was a piece of gold because

656
00:33:43,936 --> 00:33:44,960
If anything else

657
00:33:45,472 --> 00:33:49,056
That particular sniffing on your phone 911 the road to tyranny

658
00:33:49,568 --> 00:33:51,104
Is without any

659
00:33:54,688 --> 00:33:55,200
Iopener

660
00:33:55,712 --> 00:33:56,992
It's the biggest eye-opener

661
00:33:58,016 --> 00:33:58,528
We've got

662
00:33:59,040 --> 00:33:59,808
A90

663
00:34:00,064 --> 00:34:00,832
Percent conversion

664
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:05,440
I mean wow

665
00:34:06,208 --> 00:34:06,720
Iris

666
00:34:07,232 --> 00:34:08,768
Hey you know that part of your film

667
00:34:09,024 --> 00:34:10,816
The part that it wasn't true

668
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:12,864
That scared me so much

669
00:34:13,632 --> 00:34:19,776
That fake thing that now I have discovered it all other reasoning or logic

670
00:34:20,032 --> 00:34:21,056
Everything you say is fine

671
00:34:21,312 --> 00:34:22,848
Well here's the thing I have

672
00:34:23,104 --> 00:34:26,432
Do you know position that I feel drawn

673
00:34:26,688 --> 00:34:27,968
Two things that

674
00:34:28,224 --> 00:34:30,784
Are either going to change my mind

675
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:34,112
Right or I'm going to learn why it's wrong

676
00:34:34,368 --> 00:34:36,416
Correct generally that's something that

677
00:34:37,696 --> 00:34:38,720
Irene I don't think

678
00:34:40,512 --> 00:34:41,536
I don't know how to put this

679
00:34:41,792 --> 00:34:44,864
But at the beginning when we started doing this year I did not know all that much

680
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:45,632
Watch about

681
00:34:45,888 --> 00:34:48,960
Like Alex's deeper beliefs and what have you

682
00:34:49,216 --> 00:34:51,264
That I came in with a position of

683
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:52,032
I don't

684
00:34:52,288 --> 00:34:54,336
Think he's right but if he is

685
00:34:55,104 --> 00:34:56,384
I will have to adjust

686
00:34:56,896 --> 00:34:57,920
A lot of what I believe

687
00:34:58,176 --> 00:34:58,688
Of course

688
00:34:59,712 --> 00:35:00,224
He's been wrong

689
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:00,992
Almost

690
00:35:01,248 --> 00:35:02,528
Exclusively sounds fast

691
00:35:02,784 --> 00:35:06,112
This is this is being listed as a giant eye opener

692
00:35:06,368 --> 00:35:10,208
You know like this scene where they say that all Christians are terrorists

693
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:13,536
I feel drawn that like maybe I need to

694
00:35:14,048 --> 00:35:14,816
Maybe I need to

695
00:35:15,328 --> 00:35:19,168
Going now watch this documentary could be maybe I need to have my eyes open

696
00:35:19,424 --> 00:35:21,984
I think I get ready to challenge myself again

697
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:22,752
Right

698
00:35:23,008 --> 00:35:24,288
I think you're just describing what

699
00:35:24,544 --> 00:35:25,568
Genuine curiosity

700
00:35:26,336 --> 00:35:28,896
Like that idea of I am interested in this

701
00:35:29,408 --> 00:35:30,688
Regardless of the outcome

702
00:35:30,944 --> 00:35:33,760
Alright well yes but I'm not interested in this really

703
00:35:34,016 --> 00:35:35,808
I mean I understand exactly from

704
00:35:36,064 --> 00:35:39,136
I know how this propaganda works I do that when they say like

705
00:35:39,392 --> 00:35:41,440
Yes the founding fathers are terrorists

706
00:35:42,208 --> 00:35:42,976
I just got your nose

707
00:35:43,232 --> 00:35:47,072
Yes they were at that time the British were the people are in charge

708
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:50,144
By definition

709
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:53,728
You can't not say that I understand that argument

710
00:35:53,984 --> 00:35:55,776
Discussion that was probably being had in this

711
00:35:56,032 --> 00:35:57,824
Bernat super curious but

712
00:35:58,336 --> 00:35:59,360
There's more to it

713
00:36:00,128 --> 00:36:01,408
I should apprise myself of it

714
00:36:01,664 --> 00:36:02,176
Of course

715
00:36:02,432 --> 00:36:05,248
Maybe I will maybe we've got that coming down the line

716
00:36:05,504 --> 00:36:06,016
Maybe

717
00:36:06,528 --> 00:36:07,296
So

718
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:08,832
Alex

719
00:36:09,088 --> 00:36:10,624
Trying to wrestle with

720
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,160
The

721
00:36:12,416 --> 00:36:13,184
The Eric Rudolph

722
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:13,952
And the abortion

723
00:36:14,208 --> 00:36:15,488
Pain clinic bombing stuff

724
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:16,512
He's hard

725
00:36:18,048 --> 00:36:19,840
And I think he doesn't really bad job

726
00:36:23,168 --> 00:36:25,984
Everybody else out there on

727
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:28,288
Is the Holy Spirit

728
00:36:29,824 --> 00:36:30,848
Eric Rudolph

729
00:36:31,104 --> 00:36:32,128
Spiritual father is

730
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:33,408
Antecedent

731
00:36:33,664 --> 00:36:34,688
Forum on his behalf

732
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:36,480
Because if anybody right now

733
00:36:36,992 --> 00:36:38,528
Decent

734
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:39,552
He does

735
00:36:46,464 --> 00:36:49,024
Bombing abortion clinics

736
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:52,096
Bought

737
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:56,704
The reason

738
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:00,800
They're going to use that to demonize everybody

739
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:02,848
Protesting

740
00:37:07,712 --> 00:37:09,760
There isn't a number two and no

741
00:37:10,016 --> 00:37:13,088
That is not why it's right

742
00:37:15,136 --> 00:37:15,904
Bombing

743
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,440
It's in your own f****** book

744
00:37:17,696 --> 00:37:21,792
Read your own f****** book for 1 second it's it's wrong

745
00:37:22,048 --> 00:37:23,328
For Myriad reasons

746
00:37:23,584 --> 00:37:24,352
Other than tax

747
00:37:24,608 --> 00:37:25,376
Medical concerns

748
00:37:25,632 --> 00:37:26,656
It seems to be the only thing

749
00:37:27,168 --> 00:37:28,448
He's worried about the Optics of

750
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:31,008
Bombing abortion clinics

751
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:32,800
Leah inherent

752
00:37:33,056 --> 00:37:34,848
Wrongness of the actress train

753
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,384
And you hear this caller

754
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:37,408
You saying we need to

755
00:37:37,664 --> 00:37:38,688
Pray for Eric Rudolph

756
00:37:38,944 --> 00:37:45,088
Yeah he cut him off before that caller was with able to be like I support Eric Rudolph

757
00:37:45,344 --> 00:37:48,928
No no no but because the understanding of this is that he didn't do

758
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:50,208
The globalist

759
00:37:50,464 --> 00:37:53,280
Globalist did all of that okay

760
00:37:53,536 --> 00:37:56,096
Eric Rudolph is just an anti-abortion activist

761
00:37:56,352 --> 00:37:56,864
This guy

762
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:58,656
Who's being pinned for this

763
00:37:58,912 --> 00:37:59,936
Because they want to make the

764
00:38:01,216 --> 00:38:01,728
Proud look

765
00:38:02,496 --> 00:38:05,056
At the globalist of the 12 did hooker Bachman's and everything

766
00:38:05,312 --> 00:38:06,848
Are croutons just a good

767
00:38:07,104 --> 00:38:09,920
Christian man we need to pray for help

768
00:38:10,176 --> 00:38:13,504
For I don't understand how you can live with the

769
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:16,064
Cognitive dissonance it requires to be like

770
00:38:16,832 --> 00:38:17,600
That guy

771
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:21,440
Who did the thing that I want a person to do

772
00:38:21,696 --> 00:38:23,488
Was obviously set up

773
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,024
Because they want to

774
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:27,328
Like the fact that I want that person

775
00:38:27,584 --> 00:38:28,352
Listen to do things

776
00:38:28,608 --> 00:38:34,752
And that's pin the blame of those things that I want done but did not do on my move my walk them done

777
00:38:35,008 --> 00:38:37,312
Recognize that it's bad tactics and

778
00:38:37,568 --> 00:38:43,712
The globalist would recognize that too and they would want to make it look like I'm using bad tactics as a follower

779
00:38:43,968 --> 00:38:44,736
Christ

780
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:46,272
As we all know

781
00:38:46,528 --> 00:38:47,552
Christ was like

782
00:38:47,808 --> 00:38:48,320
Listen

783
00:38:48,832 --> 00:38:49,856
Turn the other cheek

784
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:52,672
Because it's a great tactical move

785
00:38:52,928 --> 00:38:55,744
And when you are on the other side you'll be able to come up with a left hook

786
00:38:56,256 --> 00:38:57,024
That's how you do it

787
00:38:58,048 --> 00:38:58,560
Boy

788
00:38:59,328 --> 00:39:02,656
I don't like I never liked it when I agree with Alex about like

789
00:39:03,168 --> 00:39:09,312
Conclusion and then he explains why he believes along with Moana

790
00:39:09,568 --> 00:39:10,080
God dammit

791
00:39:10,336 --> 00:39:10,848
You're one

792
00:39:11,104 --> 00:39:12,128
Your you're

793
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:13,664
A couple levels off

794
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:15,200
Drunk

795
00:39:15,712 --> 00:39:18,784
Yeah but I mean that's it that's the same reaction that they have till the 6th

796
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:22,624
Same reaction as the six like this was a bad idea

797
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:23,904
Because we didn't do it at the right

798
00:39:24,416 --> 00:39:30,560
We didn't succeed so it was a bad I'm nobody who truly believe in our cause would have done this therefore it was fake

799
00:39:31,328 --> 00:39:33,632
Nobody truly believes and they had the abortion

800
00:39:33,888 --> 00:39:37,728
Instead they were making great progress with would blow it up because of the bad

801
00:39:37,984 --> 00:39:40,544
Optical bad tactical decision there for the globalist

802
00:39:42,848 --> 00:39:43,360
Dumps

803
00:39:43,872 --> 00:39:44,640
So what

804
00:39:45,152 --> 00:39:46,944
I just I got to say he's pushing

805
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:47,712
This

806
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:48,992
Road to tyranny

807
00:39:49,248 --> 00:39:50,528
Clip this is Pacific clips

808
00:39:50,784 --> 00:39:51,552
So hard

809
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:56,672
We have

810
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:08,192
It's it's

811
00:40:08,448 --> 00:40:08,960
Incessant

812
00:40:09,472 --> 00:40:11,776
At this point it seems like something

813
00:40:12,032 --> 00:40:13,312
Completely enamored with

814
00:40:13,824 --> 00:40:14,592
At this point I think it's

815
00:40:14,848 --> 00:40:15,360
Good thing

816
00:40:15,616 --> 00:40:16,896
Well I mean

817
00:40:17,152 --> 00:40:19,712
100% evil thing but it's a good thing for him

818
00:40:19,968 --> 00:40:22,016
To suddenly be putting

819
00:40:22,272 --> 00:40:24,320
Everybody on the terrorist side

820
00:40:24,576 --> 00:40:26,624
Even if he did do it which he did

821
00:40:27,136 --> 00:40:28,928
We all know that was the idea who did it

822
00:40:29,184 --> 00:40:29,952
He didn't do it

823
00:40:31,232 --> 00:40:32,512
If he did do it

824
00:40:33,024 --> 00:40:35,072
You know that you need to be on his side because they're

825
00:40:35,328 --> 00:40:37,376
Claiming that all of us are terrorists

826
00:40:37,632 --> 00:40:41,984
What does it matter if he is or isn't a terrorist they're saying we are all terrorists

827
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,520
So we should be on his side

828
00:40:45,056 --> 00:40:45,568
Sort of

829
00:40:45,824 --> 00:40:47,616
I think the argument goes more like

830
00:40:48,896 --> 00:40:50,176
They were saying

831
00:40:50,432 --> 00:40:52,224
They all of us were terrorists

832
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:54,528
Write in order to make it

833
00:40:54,784 --> 00:40:55,808
Easier for them

834
00:40:56,064 --> 00:40:57,856
To say that this guy did it

835
00:40:58,112 --> 00:41:01,952
Because he fits some of the description right they were

836
00:41:02,208 --> 00:41:02,976
Referring to as

837
00:41:03,232 --> 00:41:03,744
As possible in

838
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:04,512
Indicators of

839
00:41:04,768 --> 00:41:05,280
Membership

840
00:41:05,536 --> 00:41:06,048
Open French commune

841
00:41:06,304 --> 00:41:07,328
Well since you

842
00:41:07,584 --> 00:41:08,608
Since you've restated it

843
00:41:08,864 --> 00:41:10,656
I mean that are tied

844
00:41:13,728 --> 00:41:15,264
Nothing I can say to that

845
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,592
Amazing how all of these like

846
00:41:19,872 --> 00:41:20,384
Just

847
00:41:21,152 --> 00:41:22,944
Long-term plans

848
00:41:23,456 --> 00:41:24,736
These evildoers

849
00:41:25,248 --> 00:41:26,784
Have have engaged in

850
00:41:27,808 --> 00:41:28,320
Don't work

851
00:41:28,576 --> 00:41:29,600
They never work out

852
00:41:29,856 --> 00:41:31,392
It's almost like they're

853
00:41:31,648 --> 00:41:33,440
Bad plan thought up by a moron

854
00:41:33,696 --> 00:41:34,464
Almost

855
00:41:34,976 --> 00:41:36,000
Alex

856
00:41:36,256 --> 00:41:37,536
Will not stop talking

857
00:41:37,792 --> 00:41:39,584
About that clip from his movie

858
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:41,632
But there's another thing that happen

859
00:41:42,912 --> 00:41:43,424
Getting put in

860
00:41:49,312 --> 00:41:50,080
We are going

861
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:13,631
You

862
00:42:35,647 --> 00:42:39,231
Always

863
00:42:39,487 --> 00:42:40,767
I love that

864
00:42:41,279 --> 00:42:42,047
Happens

865
00:42:42,815 --> 00:42:43,327
Totally

866
00:42:43,839 --> 00:42:45,119
100% did

867
00:42:45,375 --> 00:42:48,703
Exactly how I'm describing exactly how

868
00:42:48,959 --> 00:42:53,311
Forget to put the thing that would have really proved my point perfectly into that fell

869
00:42:53,567 --> 00:42:56,895
Did I kind of disappointed maybe cuz now we're I to go watch

870
00:42:57,151 --> 00:42:58,175
Road to tyranny

871
00:42:58,687 --> 00:43:00,479
I know that that clip isn't in there

872
00:43:01,503 --> 00:43:04,831
I want

873
00:43:05,343 --> 00:43:11,487
No it's not I was promoting that killing so hard on this episode he's really peaked my interest

874
00:43:11,743 --> 00:43:13,535
What I wish that quit was in there

875
00:43:14,047 --> 00:43:18,911
Like a trailer for a film that was reshot the movie

876
00:43:19,935 --> 00:43:20,959
I would guess

877
00:43:21,983 --> 00:43:26,335
This thing did happen it was people f****** with him as is almost always

878
00:43:26,591 --> 00:43:27,871
Is the case with any

879
00:43:28,127 --> 00:43:29,663
Scandalous video that he gets on the

880
00:43:30,175 --> 00:43:31,455
I despise

881
00:43:31,711 --> 00:43:32,479
I despise

882
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:34,527
Sometimes going back and remembering

883
00:43:34,783 --> 00:43:35,807
How anti-cop

884
00:43:36,063 --> 00:43:36,831
These people wear

885
00:43:37,343 --> 00:43:37,855
And how

886
00:43:38,367 --> 00:43:44,511
Like it boggles my mind how the cops have no idea that the people who are most likely to have

887
00:43:44,767 --> 00:43:46,047
Have blue lives matter Flags

888
00:43:46,303 --> 00:43:48,095
Are the people most likely to murder cop

889
00:43:48,607 --> 00:43:49,887
If they come to their door on the wrong

890
00:43:50,399 --> 00:43:51,935
That wild

891
00:43:53,983 --> 00:43:54,495
It certainly is

892
00:43:54,751 --> 00:43:56,287
Bananas God damn fast

893
00:43:56,799 --> 00:44:01,919
So we you know the rest of this episode is Alex talking to this City's these folks

894
00:44:02,175 --> 00:44:03,199
About to

895
00:44:03,455 --> 00:44:04,479
About Vera's

896
00:44:05,247 --> 00:44:06,527
Are there bad nurse

897
00:44:06,783 --> 00:44:10,367
Who wanted to take her baby

898
00:44:10,879 --> 00:44:11,903
And I just

899
00:44:12,159 --> 00:44:13,695
I couldn't I couldn't make sense of

900
00:44:14,207 --> 00:44:14,719
Like I was

901
00:44:14,975 --> 00:44:15,999
I was trying to

902
00:44:16,255 --> 00:44:17,023
Could not make sense of it

903
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:18,303
And I guess

904
00:44:18,559 --> 00:44:19,071
Willow Lake

905
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:20,863
I've just not a you know

906
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:22,143
I'm not a hundred percent

907
00:44:22,399 --> 00:44:23,935
Right now and Tuesday

908
00:44:24,447 --> 00:44:28,031
Is tough for me to get another episode in 2003

909
00:44:28,543 --> 00:44:30,335
I am so this is this is it

910
00:44:30,847 --> 00:44:32,383
You know it bums me out about that call

911
00:44:32,639 --> 00:44:33,151
What's up

912
00:44:33,919 --> 00:44:34,943
If you are afraid

913
00:44:35,455 --> 00:44:36,223
Of them

914
00:44:36,479 --> 00:44:36,991
Saying

915
00:44:37,759 --> 00:44:40,319
We don't want your money we want your firstborn child

916
00:44:41,087 --> 00:44:41,599
Doesn't that

917
00:44:41,855 --> 00:44:43,647
Suggest you think there was a possibility that they

918
00:44:43,903 --> 00:44:44,671
They could have pulled it off

919
00:44:45,951 --> 00:44:52,095
People like Alex do believe that happens all the time

920
00:44:52,351 --> 00:44:55,167
That's true they wouldn't be like hey you have to get through all these

921
00:44:55,423 --> 00:44:56,191
These places there

922
00:44:56,447 --> 00:44:57,727
You can call somebody

923
00:44:57,983 --> 00:45:01,567
The cops will show up if you they stole your baby low no I think

924
00:45:01,823 --> 00:45:04,639
It's just a unique situation

925
00:45:04,895 --> 00:45:11,039
Company would go after that

926
00:45:14,367 --> 00:45:20,511
I believe that you have not provided over bubble to be joint argument that scare the document would have

927
00:45:20,767 --> 00:45:25,887
How to get around giving birth but the family is not in the room

928
00:45:26,143 --> 00:45:29,215
They're not allowed anywhere near the hospital so they're going to join

929
00:45:29,471 --> 00:45:35,615
Disappear are they even are they going to replace it with a with a changeling are they going to give him a change

930
00:45:35,871 --> 00:45:37,407
Evil store comes in

931
00:45:38,687 --> 00:45:39,967
Stork

932
00:45:40,223 --> 00:45:45,087
So what he does replaces your baby with a Vlasic pickle that's brutal

933
00:45:45,343 --> 00:45:46,367
That's an evil f******

934
00:45:46,623 --> 00:45:48,159
Stork

935
00:45:49,183 --> 00:45:55,327
I like the idea of

936
00:45:55,583 --> 00:45:56,863
Remember now to get to steal the baby

937
00:45:57,119 --> 00:45:59,935
The Krampus of sorts

938
00:46:04,031 --> 00:46:04,543
Should scare people

939
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:12,223
I feel a little bit better I think there's some really terrible time

940
00:46:12,991 --> 00:46:16,063
Not feeling well around the same time that you're taking off

941
00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:16,831
But

942
00:46:17,087 --> 00:46:19,647
You know it is what it is will be back

943
00:46:21,183 --> 00:46:21,695
Indeed we will

944
00:46:22,719 --> 00:46:23,487
Until they

945
00:46:24,767 --> 00:46:25,791
Facebook website

946
00:46:29,631 --> 00:46:32,191
Twitter

947
00:46:32,447 --> 00:46:35,263
Go to bed

948
00:46:35,519 --> 00:46:38,591
Please find a local charity or bail Fund in your area to help out people

949
00:46:39,103 --> 00:46:41,919
God's work right until then

950
00:46:42,175 --> 00:46:43,455

951
00:46:45,247 --> 00:46:46,271
Robots

952
00:46:46,783 --> 00:46:48,831
Holding

953
00:46:50,879 --> 00:46:54,463
Alexandra first in color with huge fan I love your work
