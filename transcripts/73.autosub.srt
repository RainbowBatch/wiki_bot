Your fault your

You're turning down

7
00:00:42,496 --> 00:00:43,264
My voice in your ear

8
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:49,664
My ears on the recorder we have it on Matt Riggs alive

9
00:00:51,712 --> 00:00:57,856
Forgot to go to Iceland

10
00:01:01,952 --> 00:01:02,464
Anything about

11
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:07,072
That's where we find our fun avoided the entire United

12
00:01:07,584 --> 00:01:09,888
I can't imagine how great

13
00:01:12,192 --> 00:01:12,704
Wonder

14
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,240
Wondered at 8

15
00:01:14,496 --> 00:01:16,288
10 million-year-old thing

16
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:17,824
And how little and help

17
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:22,432
Petty all of our squabbles I got home and I wanted to burn down

18
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,248
That's what f***

19
00:01:25,504 --> 00:01:28,320
No Comfort after that

20
00:01:28,576 --> 00:01:30,624
So

21
00:01:31,648 --> 00:01:33,696
Love your Traditions are new donator

22
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:37,024
Not so much a new donator

23
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:43,424
Foreign policy expert I believe is what we decided to call

24
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:45,472
Thank you so much

25
00:01:45,728 --> 00:01:47,520
For bumping up that.

And thank you very much we appreciate it we need your support quite frankly it's going down

27
00:01:53,408 --> 00:01:59,296

00:01:59,552 --> 00:02:03,392
That is exactly what we would like a policy wonk

29
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:08,000
Bigweld

30
00:02:08,256 --> 00:02:09,536
What does already

31
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:14,144
This is not news to anybody we have actually looked

32
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,424
At a button

33
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,776
And I imagine that we will be

34
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:21,824
Sending those out very shortly

35
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,104

We actually work for what you cannot send a message and knowledge fight at gmail.com

40
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:46,912
Or at the Facebook page

41
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:48,192

45
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:04,576
Absolute we'll see about that but for you and one for your friends and I'll

46
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:08,672
Australia rosinski

47
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:10,976
Jordans

48
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:13,792
Yes sir times ahead of us

49
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:20,192
So I would have got some wine for drinking a little wine today

50
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:22,496
81 g of sugar

51
00:03:22,752 --> 00:03:23,520
In their soda

52
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:26,848
No ma'am

53
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,176
We're drinking

54
00:03:30,432 --> 00:03:33,760
Because that is

55
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:36,064
I think what we should do is

56
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:40,928
That sounds great it's the perfect perfect

57
00:03:41,184 --> 00:03:41,696
Pairing

58
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:45,024
I used to in college maybe even before College

59
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:51,424
I used to be a tequila tequila

60
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:56,544
I actually secretly didn't like the taste of it

61
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,848
Eastwood completely knock it out

62
00:03:59,104 --> 00:04:03,712
Oh they're completely knock out the taste of tequila

63
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:06,528
Tequila and secretly didn't like

64
00:04:06,784 --> 00:04:09,344
But everybody was doing it

65
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,136
Like I did it

66
00:04:11,392 --> 00:04:16,512
The double down on tequila decision myself but I always told you I got

67
00:04:16,768 --> 00:04:18,815
Like the combination of the flavors but

68
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:23,423
As a 33-year old man I'm ready to tell everyone I was f****** lying I just hated tequila

69
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:24,447
But I wanted to be at

70
00:04:24,703 --> 00:04:26,239
Tequila guy

71
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:27,007
So anyway

72
00:04:27,263 --> 00:04:29,055
That sounds like a that sounds like a bad girl

73
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:33,407
Speaking of people trying to present themselves as something they're not

74
00:04:33,663 --> 00:04:35,199
It's time to talk about Alex Jones

75
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:41,599
I want to declare war on all of humanity

76
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:44,671
But

77
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:46,719
Forget to that I have an out-of-context

78
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:59,519
In the course of the subject matter for that I have to go over this episode

79
00:04:59,775 --> 00:05:04,895
Like three times

80
00:05:05,151 --> 00:05:06,431
Or on Media Matters

81
00:05:09,503 --> 00:05:13,087
Like something that I would want to say

82
00:05:13,343 --> 00:05:19,487
If you're listening to this in a conservative conservatives are b****** no knowledge

83
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:21,279
Contacts dropped from a guest

84
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:22,303
Source

85
00:05:22,559 --> 00:05:27,167
We have contacts drop from the one the only Donald Trump

86
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:32,543
I think it's appropriate

87
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:36,127
Obviously agrees with everything Trump says

88
00:05:36,383 --> 00:05:38,943
Yeah I am so full

89
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:40,735
So we're not going to deal with him

90
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:45,087
I'm talking about Trump's press conference at all

91
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:45,855
This

92
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:46,623
F******

93
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:48,159
King of words

94
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:50,463
Isaac is being under-reported

95
00:05:50,719 --> 00:05:52,255
You know the media

96
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:53,535
That I think it's hilarious

97
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:56,095
Okay so here's an out-of-context drop from Trump

98
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:06,335
And have a good time

99
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:11,711
God dammit

100
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:17,855
It's all my God

101
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:22,463
Every single f****** person who voted for Trump

102
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:26,559
You should have your right to vote taken away we're starting out hot

103
00:06:26,815 --> 00:06:27,327
Respect

104
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:28,607
You should be spanked

105
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:35,263
I mean that in a very place I don't even care

106
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:37,567
Almost an argument

107
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:39,871
How to send it all but dude saying that it should have been

108
00:06:40,127 --> 00:06:43,455
It should be retroactively a felony to have voted for Trump

109
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:45,503
I don't know if I agree with that

110
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:51,903
Walking the only way to really deal with

111
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:53,439
Six bells Dan

112
00:06:57,023 --> 00:06:57,535
We had some

113
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:58,815
Some trouble in America

114
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:03,935
Over the last couple days in Charlottesville Virginia

115
00:07:04,447 --> 00:07:05,727
33 minutes

116
00:07:05,983 --> 00:07:06,495
After it was

117
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:09,311
Heard of it

118
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:14,687
Murdered

119
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:15,455
A woman

120
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:17,503
At least

121
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:18,527
Twenty-two other

122
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:20,831
And

123
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:21,855
Yeah I think

124
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:24,927
I think that is the one thing that

125
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:27,487
So-so

126
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:29,279
Before we even get started

127
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:33,375
Going to get into Civil War

128
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:43,615
These people are literal not

129
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:46,175
So this is

130
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:52,575
Put out manifestos that they're very clear

131
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:55,647
Support

132
00:07:58,207 --> 00:08:02,815
They're done irons if you go to play it like I really don't encourage people to do this cuz it

133
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:04,095
Ruby

134
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:06,143
Jarring to your mental health but

135
00:08:06,399 --> 00:08:08,959
I subject myself to this s*** for whatever reason

136
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:13,823
You go to places like Stormfront or the daily Stormer and stuff like that

137
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:16,895
You'll see exactly what their perspective on all this is

138
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:19,455
It's what you'd expect they're thrilled

139
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:21,759
Play love it

140
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:24,063
Trump refuses to

141
00:08:25,087 --> 00:08:26,367
Call them out he refuses

142
00:08:26,623 --> 00:08:28,415
Save a white nationalism is a problem

143
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:29,439
He refuses

144
00:08:29,695 --> 00:08:30,207
To say like

145
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:30,975
The clan

146
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:32,511
Get out of here

147
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:35,071
He says that there's trouble on both sides

148
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:36,863
Is Manna From Heaven

149
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:37,631
Two people

150
00:08:37,887 --> 00:08:39,167
Like these Nazi groups

151
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:45,311
So you're saying

152
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:46,847
That's that's

153
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:48,639
And and frankly at

154
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:50,175
I cry halfway

155
00:08:50,431 --> 00:08:50,943
Disagree

156
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:52,735
But the other part

157
00:08:52,991 --> 00:08:54,015
F****** nobody

158
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:54,783
Stopping this

159
00:08:55,039 --> 00:08:55,807
Nobody doing

160
00:08:56,319 --> 00:08:56,831
About it

161
00:08:58,111 --> 00:09:03,487
I got off the plane and thought now that I'm in America do I need to

162
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:06,815
That was my first

163
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:07,839
Twitter

164
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:10,911
At this point

165
00:09:12,191 --> 00:09:15,007
Give me a couple of days

166
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:22,687
Need to get classes you don't know how to handle a firearm be useless with a gun

167
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:35,487
Currently it's super cool to be racist right now

168
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:36,767
Well in certain

169
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:38,815
I'm so

170
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:40,351
That is that

171
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:41,631
Car incident

172
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:43,167
Then we'll get into and we'll discuss

173
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:47,007
But beyond that that was day two of an ongoing

174
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:48,031
Situation in Charlotte

175
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:51,615
Alright the night before there had been a unite the right

176
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:53,151
Type of rally

177
00:09:53,407 --> 00:09:55,455
We're of a bunch of people with torches

178
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:56,991
2

179
00:09:57,247 --> 00:10:00,831
The statue of a confederate general that was going to be taken down

180
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:06,719
Confederate generals statue

181
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:07,487
Taken

182
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:11,071
Yes

183
00:10:11,583 --> 00:10:14,655
Deeper than people are dealing with

184
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:15,679
Just white people get

185
00:10:15,935 --> 00:10:16,959
Together to be

186
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:21,567
No in May on May 15th of this year there was a protest

187
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:23,615
Because people were moving

188
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:27,711
Two-door no starting to talk about taking down the statue of Robert E Lee

189
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:28,991
That was in

190
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:30,527
Downtown area

191
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:33,343
Richard Spencer

192
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:35,135
There in May

193
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:36,671
2

194
00:10:36,927 --> 00:10:38,463
To protest the take

195
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:39,743
Of that statue

196
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:41,023
And then in June

197
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:42,815
Of this year on June 8th

198
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:45,119
The Klu Klux Klan held a rally there

199
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:46,911
Basically

200
00:10:47,167 --> 00:10:49,471
Around the same thing protecting him

201
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:51,007
And stuff like that

202
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:54,591
There was another Klan rally on July 8th

203
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:56,383
You're in Charlottesville again

204
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:58,175
We're about 50 people

205
00:10:58,431 --> 00:10:58,943
From the clan

206
00:10:59,199 --> 00:10:59,711
Showed up

207
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:01,247
Santa Rosa map

208
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:04,063
And 1000 people

209
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:05,087
Account

210
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:05,855
Demonstrating

211
00:11:06,111 --> 00:11:10,463
Over the last few months already

212
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:12,255
These tensions

213
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:15,583
Coming to the surface

214
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:16,607
Charlottesville

215
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:19,167
Pyridium

216
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:24,031
But around this

217
00:11:24,287 --> 00:11:27,615
Specific issue there is a pretext

218
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:29,151
Do what's going on

219
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:35,551
That you didn't even know

220
00:11:35,807 --> 00:11:37,343
It largely was

221
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:40,927
This statue

222
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:42,207
Statue right

223
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:43,487
It's tough

224
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:47,583
Michael

225
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:49,631
Jordan from the United Center

226
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:50,655
Care

227
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:51,423
I mean I think

228
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:52,447
Think that would be offensive to

229
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:53,983
Confederate roots

230
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:57,311
Didn't they take down the giant Marilyn Monroe downtown

231
00:11:57,567 --> 00:11:59,359
Seriously

232
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:04,991
That is something

233
00:12:05,247 --> 00:12:08,319
A little bit reductive because it's become so much more

234
00:12:10,623 --> 00:12:11,135
Internet

235
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:15,743
Yeah so this rally saw a bunch of people from

236
00:12:15,999 --> 00:12:17,535
Very disparate groups

237
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:18,303
Including the

238
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:19,071
Plan

239
00:12:19,327 --> 00:12:21,119
Including the league of the South

240
00:12:21,631 --> 00:12:24,191
The proud boys were in effect

241
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:27,263
Biker groups that are just malicious

242
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:31,103
There were the Fraternal Order of the all tonight

243
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:36,223
Which is the military portion of the proud boys there was identity evropa

244
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:38,527
Which is a

245
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:44,927
There was talk about a bunch more Vanguard America

246
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:45,951
A bunch of

247
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:46,975
White nationalist

248
00:12:47,231 --> 00:12:47,743
LARPing

249
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:53,119
Yeah that's exactly what that they were all coming together

250
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:56,191
Before we get too deep into this

251
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:57,727
I think it's important

252
00:12:57,983 --> 00:13:00,031
For us to say that there are reasonable

253
00:13:00,287 --> 00:13:02,591
Conservative people in the world

254
00:13:03,359 --> 00:13:03,871
Come on

255
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:05,919
That's not fair

256
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:07,967
It can be fair later

257
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:11,551
It can be fair later

258
00:13:12,063 --> 00:13:12,831
That's that

259
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:14,623
The situation is it

260
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:18,975
Well it's like saying there were reasonable people who supported Japanese

261
00:13:20,255 --> 00:13:22,815
No that's not fair because not all conservatives

262
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:23,583
Defend

263
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:27,167
Situation

264
00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:29,983
Important for us

265
00:13:30,239 --> 00:13:36,383
To clarify cuz we're going to get really hard on these folks I don't want I don't want it to be

266
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:37,663
Be some sort of like

267
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:42,783
Everybody who I have conservative feelings were painting you with this brush

268
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:46,623
Because we're going to get into a territory I believe

269
00:13:46,879 --> 00:13:48,159
Especially in the near future

270
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:48,927
Where

271
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:49,695
You're going

272
00:13:49,951 --> 00:13:50,463
2 speed

273
00:13:50,719 --> 00:13:52,255
A lot of radical

274
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:53,023
Groups

275
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:54,047
That are attacking

276
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:54,815
The center

277
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:56,607
There are Centrist

278
00:13:57,119 --> 00:13:58,143
Conservatives are Centrist

279
00:13:58,655 --> 00:13:59,423
Liberal Folk

280
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:01,215
And it's not fair

281
00:14:01,727 --> 00:14:02,239
2

282
00:14:03,263 --> 00:14:06,847
If people are blind lead sitting by and being silent about this

283
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:08,895
There is some complicity

284
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:10,431
In silence I agree with that

285
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:12,479
I think there's

286
00:14:12,735 --> 00:14:13,759
Simplicity in

287
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:15,807
Meaningless words

288
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:17,855
Like other thing that I've seen

289
00:14:18,111 --> 00:14:18,623
A lot

290
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:21,439
Throughout the news and all of those things

291
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:22,207
Things is

292
00:14:22,463 --> 00:14:23,487
People would like

293
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:25,279
Stronger condemnation

294
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:28,351
For a stronger condemnation

295
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:31,167
Yeah

296
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:32,447
It doesn't matter houses

297
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:37,311
They condemn it says he condemned

298
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:38,591
F*** him

299
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:40,383
I don't give a s*** about what he says

300
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:42,687
He's part of the reason they're there

301
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:44,991
Dislike

302
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:46,783
Oh there are Centrist like

303
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:50,111
F*** you

304
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:56,511
I have troubled by this

305
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:59,327
But just happened to lean conservative

306
00:15:01,631 --> 00:15:03,679
Yeah but that's like the log cabin

307
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:07,263
You know if you are a gay

308
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:08,031
Conservative

309
00:15:08,543 --> 00:15:09,055
That seems

310
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:09,823
Insane

311
00:15:10,335 --> 00:15:11,359
I get that you want

312
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:16,991
The gop's trying to eradicate

313
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:19,039
That's like that's like a

314
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:20,063
Jewish knock

315
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:21,855
Like that's what that is

316
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:23,135
George Soros

317
00:15:25,439 --> 00:15:25,951
You're right

318
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:32,351
Considering we deal with Jewish Nazis all the time fair enough

319
00:15:32,607 --> 00:15:38,751
Exhaust you today and I think my position is fair and there

320
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:42,847
It's a complicated position that we're all going to have to wrestle with in the coming months

321
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:48,223
Some s*** but be that as it may that was the first night that was on

322
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:48,991
Friday

323
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:52,575
Yeah this first one

324
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:55,135
Then I'll fighting broke out

325
00:15:55,647 --> 00:15:59,231
Deemed unlawful Gathering

326
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:01,791
Which is something that is illegally Define

327
00:16:02,047 --> 00:16:05,119
Were there a lot of cops

328
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:08,191
There were they were they

329
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:09,215
People in cups

330
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:09,983
Swear they

331
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:17,407
Making sure that they went to jail really wasn't so terrible

332
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:20,735
Were the peaceful protesters White

333
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:23,807
I get you I'm sorry

334
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:25,343
I'm going to break you

335
00:16:27,647 --> 00:16:32,255
You going to lose your voice

336
00:16:32,511 --> 00:16:33,279
From screaming

337
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:37,375
Unlawful Gathering

338
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:40,447
Three or more people who are gathered

339
00:16:42,239 --> 00:16:43,007
To disturb the

340
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:45,311
Peace or cause some sort of illegal actions

341
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:48,639
That's not protected by the First Amendment

342
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:51,199
Slander and libel

343
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:52,991
That's not protected by 3 ft

344
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:55,039
If you're gathering with the intention of

345
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:56,831
Like destroying something

346
00:16:57,087 --> 00:16:59,903
That's not free that's not free congregation or whatever

347
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:01,695
That's not that that's not protesting

348
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:03,231
That's not demonstrating

349
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:04,767
The police have every right

350
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:07,327
Do demons act like you got to go home

351
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:11,167
Activated that the first night on Friday and then Saturday the reward

352
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:16,799
So we're going to be

353
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:19,103
We're going to get into all that

354
00:17:20,383 --> 00:17:25,759
Is Alex Jones put out a hour long video on Saturday

355
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:27,807
Emergency

356
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:28,575
Broadcast

357
00:17:30,879 --> 00:17:34,207
Because I want to talk about

358
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:36,767
I found some really weird to talk about

359
00:17:37,535 --> 00:17:43,679
Or even I had planned to go over Friday because he's got a bunch of lies about

360
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:45,983
Would like

361
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:47,263
To get into but we can't

362
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:50,335
Steven pisses me off

363
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:52,639
Recording this on Sunday

364
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:56,991
He's doing it Sunday show I'm sure he's got a f****** whole new spin for all this

365
00:17:58,783 --> 00:18:00,063
How to do a live episodes

366
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:02,367
Almost

367
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:07,231
It feels like this might be outdated in terms of propaganda even by the time

368
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:09,535
The stairs

369
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:11,583
Even by the time we record

370
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:15,679
Yeah but it's worth it to go over in the Sun so we can get a sense of what is his

371
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:17,727
Deal with it

372
00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:19,775
And maybe I can get some

373
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:20,543
Catharsis

374
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:25,663
Maybe we'll see not all that much

375
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:26,943
In terms of

376
00:18:28,223 --> 00:18:32,063
Explain where I've got stuff out and when I do but it's mostly just

377
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:33,343
Segmented pieces

378
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:36,671
Yeah

379
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:38,207
Ladies and gentlemen

380
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:41,023
6 months

381
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:43,583
You would see Riot star

382
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:45,119
Lake Park in the summer

383
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:49,215
You've been predicting it for 20 years

384
00:18:52,287 --> 00:18:53,311
George

385
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:54,847
BB

386
00:18:55,359 --> 00:18:56,127
He was getting

387
00:18:56,639 --> 00:18:57,919
Black lives matter

388
00:18:58,175 --> 00:18:59,967
Race pace

389
00:19:01,247 --> 00:19:01,759
Grinch

390
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:09,439
Civil unrest

391
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:12,767
Confederate generals

392
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:24,543
Bulshit

393
00:19:28,639 --> 00:19:31,199
You are

394
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:35,039
We got the other two.

395
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:36,063
Protest

396
00:19:41,183 --> 00:19:41,695
You are

397
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:49,631
Black lives matter

398
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:00,383
Cultural garbage

399
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:03,711
Probably White

400
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:06,527
MP3 is Pikachu

401
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:10,623
100

402
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:15,487
Of what Martin Luther King's death

403
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:28,543
Already we have listened to the first of minute-and-a-half

404
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:33,407
Half of his video or not

405
00:20:33,663 --> 00:20:34,687
I'm into it

406
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:37,503
All these white supremacist folks

407
00:20:37,759 --> 00:20:38,527
In

408
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:41,855
Because everyone keeps

409
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:45,951
And he's not he's just misrepresenting and misunderstanding things that he sees

410
00:20:46,207 --> 00:20:52,351
And pretending that they're mainstream culture aborting white babies was on a very

411
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:53,375
Radical blog

412
00:20:53,631 --> 00:20:55,935
Yeah that was a blog post that some

413
00:20:56,959 --> 00:20:59,775
Glittery far-out

414
00:21:00,031 --> 00:21:01,055
Radical

415
00:21:01,311 --> 00:21:02,079
Where is that

416
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:05,151
Did we have we gone over

417
00:21:05,407 --> 00:21:05,919
It's just

418
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:12,319
Owner of 100 readers

419
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:18,464
You find these terrible examples and then pretends that it

420
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,768
This is the mainstream idea

421
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,072
Really searched hard for that

422
00:21:24,608 --> 00:21:26,400
Demon screams

423
00:21:26,656 --> 00:21:29,216
15th page of Google search results

424
00:21:29,472 --> 00:21:32,288
Until these right-wing out with pick it up and then

425
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:37,408
But then also you pointed it out even as the video is going

426
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:38,944
He is such a dick

427
00:21:39,456 --> 00:21:39,968
Because

428
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,528
He's saying that like as I predicted

429
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:48,928
Like if you're listening to our show you've heard in 2015 he was saying

430
00:21:49,184 --> 00:21:53,024
In 2016 he goes on about how Obama is going to cause

431
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,816
All kinds of Civic

432
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:58,656
Disorder so he can become president forever

433
00:21:58,912 --> 00:22:03,776
Palace of the italicized

434
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:10,176
Completely falling apart and not come through and he's never been like

435
00:22:10,688 --> 00:22:15,552
In the same way with the financial stuff next week I'll wait next week

436
00:22:15,808 --> 00:22:16,832
Come in the winter

437
00:22:17,088 --> 00:22:21,184
Yeah until eventually there's something like this

438
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:21,952
This

439
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:24,768
What's going on is bad cuz I got it all along

440
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,584
So stupid here later you're going to get one

441
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:31,680
Makeup over and over and over

442
00:22:32,192 --> 00:22:33,216
It's going to rain today

443
00:22:33,472 --> 00:22:33,984
It's going to rain today

444
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:40,384
Today it's going to rain today sooner or later it's going to f****** rent it would not be impressive as Babe Ruth called his shot every time

445
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:46,784
And every time we going out

446
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:53,184
Every single was going out

447
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:57,024
Some of the shine of your predictions when you've been wrong all the time at your

448
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,304
Saying the same thing

449
00:22:59,584 --> 00:23:00,352
I mean we got it

450
00:23:00,608 --> 00:23:01,632
Using whiteness

451
00:23:01,888 --> 00:23:06,240
He wants to create he wants to create strong men attacking White

452
00:23:06,496 --> 00:23:08,544
In order to justify

453
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,080
Profound

454
00:23:10,848 --> 00:23:13,408
And like we said also

455
00:23:13,664 --> 00:23:14,432
We got the proof

456
00:23:14,688 --> 00:23:16,736
We got plenty of proof that you are a bigot

457
00:23:16,992 --> 00:23:20,832
You f****** and you know it

458
00:23:21,088 --> 00:23:23,648
It felt like we had something up

459
00:23:23,904 --> 00:23:24,928
On the internet

460
00:23:25,184 --> 00:23:26,720
You being a f****** racist

461
00:23:26,976 --> 00:23:29,024
Google

462
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:33,120
What are the clips that you are

463
00:23:33,376 --> 00:23:36,192
Doing diligent research

464
00:23:39,008 --> 00:23:41,824
You just open the book up first page

465
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,152
If you want to pull that s*** at least

466
00:23:46,944 --> 00:23:51,040
That's the same thing with the Trump shirt

467
00:23:51,552 --> 00:23:53,088
Oh I I can't take it

468
00:23:53,856 --> 00:23:54,880
I can't because those are

469
00:23:55,136 --> 00:23:56,416
The people who like me the most

470
00:23:56,928 --> 00:24:00,256
So you have to have that just like Trump

471
00:24:00,512 --> 00:24:01,024
White Nash

472
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:01,792
Let's because

473
00:24:02,304 --> 00:24:03,072
They're the reason

474
00:24:03,328 --> 00:24:07,680
They even said it

475
00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:08,704
Quote here

476
00:24:09,216 --> 00:24:14,848
Was this represents a turning point for the people of this country

477
00:24:15,104 --> 00:24:17,152
We're determined to take our country back we're going to

478
00:24:17,408 --> 00:24:18,944
Fulfill the promises of Donald Trump

479
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,480
And that's what we believe.

480
00:24:20,736 --> 00:24:22,272
Then that's why we voted for Donald Trump

481
00:24:22,528 --> 00:24:23,296
Because he said he

482
00:24:23,552 --> 00:24:24,832
He's going to take our country back

483
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:26,112
And that's what we're going to do

484
00:24:28,672 --> 00:24:30,208
You know how white people

485
00:24:30,464 --> 00:24:30,976
Play detector country

486
00:24:33,024 --> 00:24:33,792
So help me info

487
00:24:34,048 --> 00:24:37,376
All of the all of the people who are afraid of white genocide

488
00:24:37,888 --> 00:24:40,448
Are really making it hard for me not

489
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:41,728
Want

490
00:24:43,264 --> 00:24:45,056
I'm leaning towards

491
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:46,080
Outlook

492
00:24:46,336 --> 00:24:47,872
I was at a hard no

493
00:24:49,152 --> 00:24:50,432
Sterno

494
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:55,552
Now I'm in the 5% nation

495
00:24:55,808 --> 00:24:56,832
Do you get what I'm saying

496
00:25:02,976 --> 00:25:03,744
Frankly

497
00:25:04,512 --> 00:25:07,840
You can't take it out a continent

498
00:25:08,096 --> 00:25:10,400
Really

499
00:25:10,656 --> 00:25:11,680
Contacts

500
00:25:11,936 --> 00:25:13,472
Exactly what you need

501
00:25:13,728 --> 00:25:18,336
Next Clipper boots-on-the-ground

502
00:25:18,592 --> 00:25:19,360
Infowars dead

503
00:25:19,616 --> 00:25:20,128
Of course

504
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:25,248
The boots-on-the-ground more info specifically like an employee

505
00:25:26,528 --> 00:25:27,296
Show I mean

506
00:25:31,648 --> 00:25:32,928
The elite not you

507
00:25:33,184 --> 00:25:34,464
Here is the breaking news

508
00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:39,584
Nope

509
00:25:42,656 --> 00:25:43,680
Millie Weaver

510
00:25:44,192 --> 00:25:50,336
Rainbow stats

511
00:25:54,176 --> 00:25:55,712
Good

512
00:25:55,968 --> 00:25:58,784
Good again

513
00:25:59,296 --> 00:26:02,624
The police were ordered to stand out of the Hillary supporter

514
00:26:03,904 --> 00:26:06,208
Charlottesville vote Democrat

515
00:26:10,304 --> 00:26:12,352
Reportedly

516
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:15,936
Facebook

517
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,776
Civil emergency declared

518
00:26:20,032 --> 00:26:22,592
No public meetings which is martial law

519
00:26:22,848 --> 00:26:23,360
Nope

520
00:26:23,616 --> 00:26:24,128
Emergency

521
00:26:24,384 --> 00:26:26,944
Going to start so far in Virginia

522
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:30,528
This is all about leading to martial law

523
00:26:31,296 --> 00:26:31,808
Just not

524
00:26:33,344 --> 00:26:33,856
What are you doing

525
00:26:34,624 --> 00:26:36,928
You are weird

526
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:37,952
Yeah

527
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:41,536
Okay

528
00:26:43,072 --> 00:26:44,352
I appreciate that

529
00:26:46,656 --> 00:26:47,424
This is

530
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:55,872
For less than 24 hours you can handle screaming for as long as

531
00:26:56,384 --> 00:27:00,992
You might feel like you should face in this episode of run out of throat

532
00:27:01,248 --> 00:27:07,392
Man that's a bad I'm willing to take the level

533
00:27:09,952 --> 00:27:11,744
Because this is my first opportunity

534
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:13,280
To do anything

535
00:27:13,792 --> 00:27:16,864
More that's like I haven't even I haven't even been around other

536
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,144
Human beings

537
00:27:19,936 --> 00:27:22,752
So so my my instinct is to get out

538
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:25,312
All of the ship that's been building up

539
00:27:25,568 --> 00:27:26,080
For the past 20

540
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:29,152
To dial it back

541
00:27:31,456 --> 00:27:31,968
Okay

542
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:33,504
.

543
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:36,320
Okay I don't even want to engage with what

544
00:27:36,576 --> 00:27:38,368
Because if you want to

545
00:27:38,624 --> 00:27:40,160
If you don't pull its National

546
00:27:40,416 --> 00:27:41,440
Emergency

547
00:27:41,696 --> 00:27:42,720
Martial law

548
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,024
Going to run

549
00:27:48,608 --> 00:27:54,752
It's a problem martial law

550
00:27:55,264 --> 00:27:56,800
I think he kind of

551
00:27:57,056 --> 00:27:58,336
Does

552
00:27:58,592 --> 00:27:59,616
But it's only against

553
00:27:59,872 --> 00:28:02,688
Antifa

554
00:28:02,944 --> 00:28:04,224
People who are against fashion

555
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:11,904
Exactly it's really interesting

556
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:14,208
I've built up an entire career that is

557
00:28:14,464 --> 00:28:14,976
Tyranny

558
00:28:15,232 --> 00:28:17,280
Against police oppression but please

559
00:28:17,536 --> 00:28:19,072
Police go squash those leftist

560
00:28:19,328 --> 00:28:20,096
Frantically

561
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,936
Rainbow snatch was in effect

562
00:28:24,192 --> 00:28:30,336
I want to say I don't think she was out there Millie Weaver

563
00:28:30,592 --> 00:28:36,736
Cook County

564
00:28:36,992 --> 00:28:39,808
She's out there and I don't trust a word she says

565
00:28:40,064 --> 00:28:46,208
So this idea that he's reporting based on what she said I'm going to need more I've got anymore

566
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:50,560
Is the clown I don't believe

567
00:28:50,816 --> 00:28:53,376
She's like we are at we allegedly have

568
00:28:53,632 --> 00:28:54,912
But you can't afford it

569
00:28:55,168 --> 00:28:55,936
Reported

570
00:29:01,312 --> 00:29:07,456
Jackie reportedly there's videos you can't report that you can't pretend

571
00:29:07,968 --> 00:29:11,552
Cuz your dumb ass listeners are going to hear that is

572
00:29:11,808 --> 00:29:13,600
It's very dangerous

573
00:29:13,856 --> 00:29:15,904
Oh yeah that's the other thing

574
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:19,232
I'm really running low on

575
00:29:20,256 --> 00:29:22,560
Mater Lakes

576
00:29:22,816 --> 00:29:28,960
F*** you everything is vaguely or obliquely India

577
00:29:29,216 --> 00:29:29,728
Exist

578
00:29:29,984 --> 00:29:36,128
It's in the Sun

579
00:29:37,152 --> 00:29:38,176
Alright well

580
00:29:38,688 --> 00:29:41,504
I'm not sure which.

581
00:29:43,808 --> 00:29:44,576
Spin City sucks.

582
00:29:45,088 --> 00:29:45,856
I'm for it

583
00:29:47,392 --> 00:29:50,208
So we kind of have an idea of what happened

584
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:57,376
I was worried about that myself I don't know

585
00:29:57,632 --> 00:30:01,216
I certainly haven't been thinking about him lately

586
00:30:01,472 --> 00:30:05,312
I don't know

587
00:30:05,568 --> 00:30:11,712
You know what those kids really simple medical shows

588
00:30:11,968 --> 00:30:14,784
A rabbit hole

589
00:30:18,368 --> 00:30:20,928
A lot of the information that we have is in

590
00:30:21,184 --> 00:30:24,512
Complete is going to come out as

591
00:30:24,768 --> 00:30:26,816
Witnesses are interviewed

592
00:30:27,072 --> 00:30:31,168
There is a larger more robots

593
00:30:31,424 --> 00:30:32,192
Reality

594
00:30:32,448 --> 00:30:33,728
But

595
00:30:35,776 --> 00:30:36,288
With

596
00:30:37,312 --> 00:30:38,080
With Twitter

597
00:30:38,848 --> 00:30:41,920
There have been a lot of things where

598
00:30:42,432 --> 00:30:43,456
Please come out

599
00:30:44,224 --> 00:30:45,504
I was there in my

600
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:51,392
My friends were all of this stuff and I like your knee

601
00:30:51,648 --> 00:30:52,672
To believe them

602
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:54,208
But I I

603
00:30:54,464 --> 00:30:56,000
I try really hard to be like

604
00:30:56,256 --> 00:30:58,560
Yes I know and the spirit of this

605
00:30:58,816 --> 00:31:01,120
Is correct but if it's not something that week

606
00:31:01,632 --> 00:31:02,144
Confirm

607
00:31:02,656 --> 00:31:03,168
Then it just

608
00:31:03,424 --> 00:31:04,704
More fuel for the Alex

609
00:31:07,008 --> 00:31:12,640
Assertive trustworthy sources and stuff like that Elizabeth

610
00:31:12,896 --> 00:31:13,920
Those white National

611
00:31:14,176 --> 00:31:15,200
Does not

612
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:16,480
He's beating the the

613
00:31:16,992 --> 00:31:23,136
20 year old black boy DeAndre Harris

614
00:31:23,392 --> 00:31:24,928
That's not reportedly

615
00:31:25,184 --> 00:31:25,952
Confirm there is

616
00:31:26,208 --> 00:31:27,232
Glee video of

617
00:31:27,488 --> 00:31:28,768
That no

618
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:31,840
He is clearly not

619
00:31:32,096 --> 00:31:34,656
Accident where they were threatened

620
00:31:35,424 --> 00:31:39,520
Sing like that they was legitimately just erased

621
00:31:39,776 --> 00:31:41,824
Nazis beating a black eye with

622
00:31:44,896 --> 00:31:47,456
The images in the video you see that they're in khakis

623
00:31:47,712 --> 00:31:48,480
Ethan white polo

624
00:31:48,992 --> 00:31:51,296
The reason

625
00:31:51,552 --> 00:31:53,600
To make fun of it and be like haha you dumb

626
00:31:54,624 --> 00:31:55,392
Old Navy

627
00:31:55,648 --> 00:31:57,440
Going motherfuker and stuff like that

628
00:31:58,464 --> 00:32:01,024
The people are taking into account that that is a uniform

629
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:04,352
What's the uniform of Vanguard America

630
00:32:04,608 --> 00:32:08,192
Like

631
00:32:08,704 --> 00:32:11,520
There's a group I thought it was just a bunch of dumbasses

632
00:32:11,776 --> 00:32:15,872
Is dressing like Trump on a f****** Golf Course

633
00:32:16,128 --> 00:32:17,152
Is WhatsApp

634
00:32:17,408 --> 00:32:17,920
Vanguard

635
00:32:18,176 --> 00:32:19,456
America dresses

636
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,016
Cuz it's I don't know

637
00:32:22,272 --> 00:32:23,040
Traditional

638
00:32:24,064 --> 00:32:25,088
Yeah

639
00:32:26,112 --> 00:32:26,624
The Nazis

640
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:27,392
How to wear a

641
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:34,304
Armbands

642
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:39,168
But you know polos and khakis are very unassuming

643
00:32:39,424 --> 00:32:44,032
And they have like a preppy fuel to them people feel like

644
00:32:45,312 --> 00:32:50,432
What happened

645
00:32:50,688 --> 00:32:51,968
As of

646
00:32:52,224 --> 00:32:52,736
Burien

647
00:32:52,992 --> 00:32:53,760
Interesting spin

648
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:56,320
About the reality of what happened

649
00:32:56,832 --> 00:32:59,392
And it's very very

650
00:32:59,648 --> 00:33:02,464
Bizarre

651
00:33:25,248 --> 00:33:27,296
So they bring you in

652
00:33:29,344 --> 00:33:33,440
Bobby all the way on the gates coming in on each side

653
00:33:35,488 --> 00:33:37,536
Reporters in a small conservative March

654
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,424
Blood everywhere

655
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:45,984
Really really

656
00:33:46,752 --> 00:33:48,800
Give the antifa a victory

657
00:33:56,992 --> 00:33:58,528
F*** you

658
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:08,000
A few people for Central Casting actors dress up yard

659
00:34:08,768 --> 00:34:10,304
Unify the right

660
00:34:10,816 --> 00:34:14,656
Don't be racist

661
00:34:29,248 --> 00:34:29,760
Whoops

662
00:34:30,016 --> 00:34:36,160
Have we ever talked about that before we may have had a long

663
00:34:36,416 --> 00:34:42,560
Conversation

664
00:34:43,072 --> 00:34:45,120
For quite a while it's

665
00:34:45,376 --> 00:34:48,192
He's relying on a lot of that sort of Lies

666
00:34:48,448 --> 00:34:50,240
In order to

667
00:35:00,224 --> 00:35:00,736
That like

668
00:35:01,248 --> 00:35:07,392
This is like one of the f****** balls I got out of the horse track yesterday very

669
00:35:12,768 --> 00:35:13,792
This is just

670
00:35:15,328 --> 00:35:15,840
Bed

671
00:35:16,608 --> 00:35:17,888
He's so far wrong

672
00:35:19,168 --> 00:35:22,240
Yeah because these got water

673
00:35:22,496 --> 00:35:23,520
Nothing even to hang a

674
00:35:23,776 --> 00:35:29,920
Actual Nazis

675
00:35:30,176 --> 00:35:31,712
Is good oh well obviously

676
00:35:31,968 --> 00:35:38,112
The Southern Poverty Law Center. Together

677
00:35:38,368 --> 00:35:39,648
To discredit the right

678
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:46,048
The f****** thing was organized by a literal Nazi Richard Spencer

679
00:35:48,352 --> 00:35:52,448
What was it f****** called the right to unite the right

680
00:35:55,008 --> 00:35:55,776
Anti-racist

681
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:05,504
Yeah well it is but there would be no more

682
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:09,344
I'm the Longview he's kind of not lying

683
00:36:16,768 --> 00:36:17,792
He's terrible

684
00:36:19,328 --> 00:36:21,376
On of all of all days

685
00:36:23,936 --> 00:36:27,008
You do look like on a normal day which we have not had for

686
00:36:27,264 --> 00:36:27,776
For several months

687
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:32,640
Or even with our investigation and all of that

688
00:36:33,408 --> 00:36:34,176
I'm far more pace

689
00:36:34,688 --> 00:36:35,200
With this car

690
00:36:35,712 --> 00:36:36,480
Call Shay

691
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:38,528
It's fun to laugh at it

692
00:36:38,784 --> 00:36:39,808
He's got nothing he

693
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:41,344
Throwing bulshit out

694
00:36:41,856 --> 00:36:42,368
Today

695
00:36:43,136 --> 00:36:43,648
Is not the

696
00:36:43,904 --> 00:36:45,696
A f****** day bow

697
00:36:45,952 --> 00:36:46,464
With it

698
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:54,144
They dismiss pronunciation

699
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:59,520
The Vietnamese food

700
00:36:59,776 --> 00:37:05,664
Everyone Infowars pronounces it wrong the same it's clearly some sort of like

701
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:12,064
Different editorial decision

702
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:13,344
You if you retake

703
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,392
Their name

704
00:37:16,416 --> 00:37:18,976
We should start calling it

705
00:37:19,232 --> 00:37:21,280
Infowars

706
00:37:21,536 --> 00:37:23,328
Sister the f*** you

707
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:25,120
I would prefer info

708
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:31,008
Alex joins Alex

709
00:37:31,264 --> 00:37:32,544
What is he normally wear

710
00:37:33,824 --> 00:37:35,872
Sweet

711
00:37:36,384 --> 00:37:38,944
Play fear oblivion

712
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:40,480
He said he wears

713
00:37:43,808 --> 00:37:47,904
Be at the idea that this is all because antifa needs to get their win back

714
00:37:48,416 --> 00:37:54,560
Is really bizarre like a pro wrestler whose like he's lost too many matches

715
00:37:54,816 --> 00:38:00,192
Anymore so whatever

716
00:38:00,448 --> 00:38:00,960
Put them over

717
00:38:01,216 --> 00:38:02,240
So also this

718
00:38:02,496 --> 00:38:05,824
This thing about the people and our reporters and

719
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:10,176
That's up being taken down this Gauntlet where they get attacked by antifa

720
00:38:10,432 --> 00:38:14,528
Is it because I'm doing is misrepresenting

721
00:38:14,784 --> 00:38:15,296
Permit

722
00:38:15,552 --> 00:38:19,392
I think he's misrepresenting the idea that like this is the area you can be in

723
00:38:19,904 --> 00:38:20,928
Because it is

724
00:38:21,184 --> 00:38:21,952
Piano public

725
00:38:22,464 --> 00:38:26,304
Area protesters and the demonstrators

726
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:27,072
The Nazis

727
00:38:27,584 --> 00:38:32,704
Had a permit let's not even come close to calling them and

728
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:36,032
The cities do that if you get a permit and you can be in

729
00:38:36,288 --> 00:38:36,800
This

730
00:38:37,312 --> 00:38:38,336
Specific space right

731
00:38:38,848 --> 00:38:40,896
And I'm sure that the other was

732
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:42,176
Was cordoned off for

733
00:38:42,432 --> 00:38:42,944
Reporters

734
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,224
Space that was

735
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:44,992
Protected

736
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,552
The police

737
00:38:51,904 --> 00:38:54,720
Some of them

738
00:38:54,976 --> 00:38:57,536
All of these things

739
00:38:58,048 --> 00:38:59,072
And that is

740
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:00,352
It's getting

741
00:39:00,608 --> 00:39:01,120
It's it's

742
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:04,192
Queen of pride

743
00:39:04,704 --> 00:39:06,240
I truly believe that the point of

744
00:39:06,496 --> 00:39:07,264
Pride for all of us

745
00:39:08,288 --> 00:39:09,312
Even these people believe

746
00:39:09,568 --> 00:39:10,592
So much more

747
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:12,128
In the ideal of America

748
00:39:12,896 --> 00:39:13,408
That they're willing

749
00:39:14,176 --> 00:39:14,688
To protect

750
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,736
The very people who won

751
00:39:16,992 --> 00:39:17,504
Want them dead

752
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,040
Yep that's amazing

753
00:39:19,552 --> 00:39:20,064
Stop

754
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:20,832
At the same time

755
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:25,184
God I want you to turn around and beat the s*** out of them

756
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:29,024
American

757
00:39:31,328 --> 00:39:34,144
What was it North or South Dakota

758
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,680
North is North Dakota

759
00:39:37,728 --> 00:39:38,240
F******

760
00:39:39,264 --> 00:39:39,776
What

761
00:39:40,032 --> 00:39:41,056
Destroid beat

762
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:41,824
Arrest

763
00:39:43,616 --> 00:39:44,128
Things done

764
00:39:44,384 --> 00:39:46,432
God I want every single cop

765
00:39:46,944 --> 00:39:48,480
Punch the s*** out of these white

766
00:39:48,736 --> 00:39:49,248
F****** Nash

767
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:50,528
Maybe night

768
00:39:50,784 --> 00:39:51,296
But I can't

769
00:39:51,552 --> 00:39:52,320
No

770
00:39:52,832 --> 00:39:53,600
Because

771
00:39:53,856 --> 00:39:55,136
I didn't want it to happen to them

772
00:39:55,904 --> 00:39:57,184
I don't want it to happen

773
00:39:58,208 --> 00:39:59,488
Damn these white

774
00:40:01,024 --> 00:40:03,072
The problem with any kind of idea logic

775
00:40:03,584 --> 00:40:04,096
Consistency

776
00:40:04,608 --> 00:40:06,400
End

777
00:40:06,912 --> 00:40:09,984
I think you might be onto something

778
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:13,312
Because Alex Jones couldn't give a s***

779
00:40:13,568 --> 00:40:16,640
Clean up beat up Native Americans

780
00:40:16,896 --> 00:40:18,432
But if you hit a white person

781
00:40:18,688 --> 00:40:19,968
There is the worst person in the world

782
00:40:22,016 --> 00:40:23,552
Goes by Whitesnake

783
00:40:25,344 --> 00:40:26,112
They're fighting a war

784
00:40:27,136 --> 00:40:27,648
And weird

785
00:40:28,416 --> 00:40:34,560
Note totally one-hundred-percent reconcile that with

786
00:40:34,816 --> 00:40:36,352
With our American friends

787
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:40,704
Let's think about it and we'll talk later

788
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:43,776
Cuz I don't think we have a

789
00:40:44,288 --> 00:40:47,616
But there's a another point that I wanted

790
00:40:47,872 --> 00:40:52,736
Little boy there was one more point that I wanted to get to about that narrative

791
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:53,504
About

792
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,808
People being taken

793
00:40:58,624 --> 00:40:59,136
Antifa

794
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:01,952
That's not the way I feel

795
00:41:02,208 --> 00:41:04,256
Speed energy sources reporting

796
00:41:04,512 --> 00:41:05,024
The situation

797
00:41:05,536 --> 00:41:06,560
Except for one

798
00:41:07,072 --> 00:41:08,608
Which one daily Stormer

799
00:41:08,864 --> 00:41:10,912
I can't think of any reason why they would have that

800
00:41:11,168 --> 00:41:15,264
There's a real decent

801
00:41:17,056 --> 00:41:20,896
There's a really decent chance that Alex Jones is getting his ideas

802
00:41:21,152 --> 00:41:21,664
Scrum

803
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:24,992
In terms of this Narrative of what the protests

804
00:41:25,504 --> 00:41:26,784
Counter-demonstrations

805
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:27,552
We're like

806
00:41:27,808 --> 00:41:32,160
I don't know maybe there are other places it is reported like that but that's the only place I've seen

807
00:41:32,672 --> 00:41:36,256
I got to be totally clear I've been looking into this stuff

808
00:41:36,512 --> 00:41:40,352
And I think the daily Stormer is mostly just trying to make people mad

809
00:41:40,864 --> 00:41:45,216
Tell for sure

810
00:41:45,472 --> 00:41:47,008
Nazi bigots and I have you

811
00:41:47,264 --> 00:41:49,056
But I think they go way over the top

812
00:41:49,312 --> 00:41:50,592
Interplexus trying to piss

813
00:41:50,848 --> 00:41:51,616
People off

814
00:41:51,872 --> 00:41:55,967
Because the one of their headlines today was about the lady who got killed

815
00:41:56,223 --> 00:41:57,759
The car

816
00:41:58,015 --> 00:42:00,063
Attack

817
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:01,087
Tell me what it is aren't

818
00:42:04,927 --> 00:42:05,439
Bouquet

819
00:42:06,207 --> 00:42:08,255
I got to tell you

820
00:42:08,511 --> 00:42:14,655
This is this is basically

821
00:42:14,911 --> 00:42:17,727
Leave it this lady was a 32-year old's that flood

822
00:42:25,407 --> 00:42:26,431
You know if you're a woman

823
00:42:26,687 --> 00:42:28,223
You're 32 and you don't have kids

824
00:42:28,479 --> 00:42:30,783
You're a complete failure to the only thing you're supposed to

825
00:42:31,039 --> 00:42:35,391
The really do is reproduce right witcha

826
00:42:35,903 --> 00:42:36,671
So insane

827
00:42:39,231 --> 00:42:42,047
Parody right

828
00:42:43,583 --> 00:42:47,167
The issue on the right is if you're going to parody

829
00:42:47,423 --> 00:42:47,935
Anything

830
00:42:48,447 --> 00:42:48,959
You just have to

831
00:42:49,983 --> 00:42:53,055
Far out there but exactly

832
00:42:54,335 --> 00:42:56,127
Comfortable things

833
00:42:56,383 --> 00:42:58,687
Much different than a lot of other b******* I see

834
00:42:58,943 --> 00:42:59,967
Exactly so I mean

835
00:43:00,735 --> 00:43:04,319
It's a tough I don't ever want

836
00:43:04,575 --> 00:43:05,087
Akira

837
00:43:05,343 --> 00:43:09,183
Refer to anything they say seriously in the future

838
00:43:09,439 --> 00:43:13,791
Bring that up because that is like the parallel between

839
00:43:14,303 --> 00:43:16,095
Alex's version of what happened

840
00:43:16,351 --> 00:43:16,863
Declaring

841
00:43:17,375 --> 00:43:17,887
So

842
00:43:18,143 --> 00:43:19,935
Alex

843
00:43:21,471 --> 00:43:23,263
Or ordered one of his reporters

844
00:43:23,519 --> 00:43:26,591
I wonder if we had the resources

845
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:29,663
I wonder if we could actually

846
00:43:30,175 --> 00:43:32,991
Traits that down like the same way those

847
00:43:33,247 --> 00:43:35,551
Those Intrepid reporters

848
00:43:35,807 --> 00:43:36,319
James comey's

849
00:43:36,575 --> 00:43:37,855
Twitter account

850
00:43:38,111 --> 00:43:40,415
If we got to a point where people

851
00:43:40,671 --> 00:43:46,815
No I can pay my rent doing the show if we had the time to put into it I could find out a lot of connections that are there is that it

852
00:43:47,071 --> 00:43:49,119
Now I got to go to work

853
00:43:49,631 --> 00:43:54,495
And then on weekends to go to the horse track

854
00:43:54,751 --> 00:43:55,775
Address that is

855
00:43:57,055 --> 00:44:03,199
Just say I'm never going back to you

856
00:44:03,967 --> 00:44:06,783
Alex Goes On

857
00:44:08,575 --> 00:44:09,343
Was filled

858
00:44:10,111 --> 00:44:10,879
Hey by George Soros

859
00:44:15,999 --> 00:44:16,511
That's just a fact

860
00:44:16,767 --> 00:44:19,071
Also I lost my bet on the pizza man

861
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:24,191
It didn't come through for me did not deliver wise man says forgiveness is divine

862
00:44:24,447 --> 00:44:25,471
But never pay full

863
00:44:28,543 --> 00:44:31,871
In this next wave Alex

864
00:44:32,127 --> 00:44:35,711
Through breaks down more of his version of the events

865
00:44:37,503 --> 00:44:38,015
Not

866
00:44:38,527 --> 00:44:39,295
Being fair about

867
00:44:41,343 --> 00:44:46,719
50 guys with torches

868
00:44:48,511 --> 00:44:51,839
Everybody

869
00:45:02,847 --> 00:45:05,919
Call Ben Victorious

870
00:45:07,199 --> 00:45:11,551
Stanford University

871
00:45:15,647 --> 00:45:17,183
Suck your own dick

872
00:45:17,695 --> 00:45:18,975
They did this at Berkeley

873
00:45:19,999 --> 00:45:22,559
They did this at other universities in Europe

874
00:45:22,815 --> 00:45:24,351
Control

875
00:45:31,775 --> 00:45:34,335
The outnumbered few conservative

876
00:45:36,383 --> 00:45:37,151
Lesbian

877
00:46:04,287 --> 00:46:06,079
Libertarian

878
00:46:11,199 --> 00:46:11,967
Facebook

879
00:46:12,479 --> 00:46:13,759
Google

880
00:46:16,575 --> 00:46:18,879
Luring in the right-wing

881
00:46:26,303 --> 00:46:28,863
Is there a

882
00:46:31,679 --> 00:46:32,959
All the peaceful people

883
00:46:35,775 --> 00:46:37,311
Civil emergency

884
00:46:40,383 --> 00:46:42,687
You can't have them

885
00:46:42,943 --> 00:46:43,967
Because what we saw happen

886
00:46:44,479 --> 00:46:47,295
That is such a complicated version of what

887
00:46:47,807 --> 00:46:50,111
Things happened that is so far off base

888
00:46:50,367 --> 00:46:52,159
Much simpler explanation

889
00:46:52,671 --> 00:46:53,695
Ben

890
00:46:53,951 --> 00:46:54,719
Everything is fake

891
00:46:54,975 --> 00:46:58,815
Storing them at like what was there a box in the

892
00:46:59,071 --> 00:47:02,399
Stick in the box has mail written on it like what the fuc

893
00:47:02,655 --> 00:47:07,263
Protest

894
00:47:07,519 --> 00:47:09,311
The demonstrations there since May

895
00:47:12,639 --> 00:47:13,919
These f****** ding dong

896
00:47:14,175 --> 00:47:17,247
Chose to go there of their own volition

897
00:47:17,503 --> 00:47:18,783
Buses and shuttles

898
00:47:19,039 --> 00:47:20,575
People from Illinois.

899
00:47:20,831 --> 00:47:23,647
Pictures of people from Illinois

900
00:47:24,159 --> 00:47:30,303
To go to goddamn Charlottesville to Beaver dick they are in real life

901
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:36,703
Doing a little bit the guy who was driving the car that ended up killing that lady was from Ohio

902
00:47:41,311 --> 00:47:42,591
Sadly unaware of the

903
00:47:42,847 --> 00:47:44,127
The stuff her son was getting into

904
00:47:46,943 --> 00:47:49,759
He thought it was he was into somebody named Albright

905
00:47:50,015 --> 00:47:56,159
What is the alt-right idea of the white supremacist was being radicalized

906
00:48:04,095 --> 00:48:09,727
Or is it all right. Albright organization so I mean

907
00:48:11,775 --> 00:48:13,567
What do you what do you think about his narrative

908
00:48:14,591 --> 00:48:15,103
I think what

909
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:16,639
I'm what I'm hearing

910
00:48:17,151 --> 00:48:17,663
Is

911
00:48:19,711 --> 00:48:20,223
Deal with

912
00:48:20,735 --> 00:48:22,527
Like this is not him

913
00:48:25,087 --> 00:48:26,367
I think he's at my

914
00:48:26,623 --> 00:48:27,135
What I'm saying

915
00:48:28,927 --> 00:48:29,695
For his listeners

916
00:48:30,207 --> 00:48:31,999
I think he's really spending it for him so

917
00:48:32,767 --> 00:48:33,279
Because

918
00:48:33,535 --> 00:48:34,303
I don't think

919
00:48:35,327 --> 00:48:35,839
Process

920
00:48:36,351 --> 00:48:36,863
That b****

921
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:37,631
Him

922
00:48:38,655 --> 00:48:39,167
His fault

923
00:48:39,679 --> 00:48:43,263
Like

924
00:48:44,543 --> 00:48:49,407
Propagated

925
00:48:49,663 --> 00:48:51,199
And this is part of who he is

926
00:48:51,711 --> 00:48:52,223
So he's

927
00:48:52,479 --> 00:48:53,759
Rewriting this as

928
00:48:54,015 --> 00:48:54,783
He speaks because

929
00:48:55,295 --> 00:48:56,831
He can't deal with the fact that

930
00:48:57,087 --> 00:48:57,855
He is a Nazi

931
00:48:58,111 --> 00:48:59,391
It's often difficult to

932
00:48:59,647 --> 00:49:04,511
Does the jarring versions of yourself and other people especially when their billing

933
00:49:06,303 --> 00:49:08,351
Every single thing about this

934
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:10,143
And I'm talking about

935
00:49:10,399 --> 00:49:11,423
Everything like there's

936
00:49:11,679 --> 00:49:15,007
No reality there's no thing for him to have

937
00:49:15,263 --> 00:49:17,823
Hang his hat on cuz generally what we used to sing

938
00:49:18,335 --> 00:49:20,383
Is ham trying to find one little.

939
00:49:20,639 --> 00:49:21,663
Detail tag Longmont

940
00:49:21,919 --> 00:49:23,199
Yeah one little thing

941
00:49:23,711 --> 00:49:24,223
And this isn't it

942
00:49:24,479 --> 00:49:24,991
Tire rear

943
00:49:25,247 --> 00:49:29,087
50 is like the script of a Dirty Dancing Havana Nights

944
00:49:29,343 --> 00:49:30,367
All the Nazis

945
00:49:30,623 --> 00:49:32,159
Nationalist

946
00:49:32,415 --> 00:49:34,207
Sewer they're great f****** reference

947
00:49:37,791 --> 00:49:38,815
I don't care

948
00:49:39,583 --> 00:49:40,863
I'm sorry

949
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:43,935
Try and Dad I'm trying to find some sort of

950
00:49:44,447 --> 00:49:47,263
Havana Nights

951
00:49:47,519 --> 00:49:49,567
Is the way to go with it

952
00:49:49,823 --> 00:49:51,871
Turn up filigree to disagree

953
00:49:52,127 --> 00:49:55,711
But the idea that all these people I were there are

954
00:49:55,967 --> 00:49:57,247
Plants is absurd

955
00:49:57,503 --> 00:49:59,551
Like it's just absurd

956
00:49:59,807 --> 00:50:01,343
The depth that you would need to

957
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:03,391
A pre-plan that

958
00:50:03,647 --> 00:50:05,183
Prohibitive

959
00:50:06,207 --> 00:50:08,255
VIP the peace organizations

960
00:50:08,511 --> 00:50:09,023
Exist

961
00:50:09,279 --> 00:50:11,327
Their membership would have to be known

962
00:50:11,583 --> 00:50:14,655
History of doing the same action

963
00:50:16,703 --> 00:50:17,471
20 year-long plan

964
00:50:17,727 --> 00:50:21,823
And not only that but even if it is

965
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:24,639
Sincere

966
00:50:25,663 --> 00:50:26,687
But even if it

967
00:50:27,455 --> 00:50:28,991
So even if it was

968
00:50:29,247 --> 00:50:30,527
Instigated by the

969
00:50:32,063 --> 00:50:32,575
There would

970
00:50:32,831 --> 00:50:33,343
Astilbe

971
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:34,111
Real guys

972
00:50:34,367 --> 00:50:34,879
There

973
00:50:35,135 --> 00:50:35,647
There were

974
00:50:35,903 --> 00:50:38,975
Yeah there were even if your

975
00:50:39,231 --> 00:50:40,255
Is that it was

976
00:50:40,511 --> 00:50:42,303
It was a false flag or whatever it is

977
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:43,583
Volkswagen

978
00:50:43,839 --> 00:50:45,375
Real f****** races

979
00:50:48,703 --> 00:50:54,591
I don't even want to engage with that cuz leave the post black narrative is so f***** out

980
00:50:54,847 --> 00:50:55,615
I just don't even

981
00:50:55,871 --> 00:50:56,895
Lincare

982
00:50:57,151 --> 00:50:57,919
But be that as it may

983
00:50:58,175 --> 00:50:59,967
We know what it's all about

984
00:51:00,223 --> 00:51:01,247
For Alex it's about white

985
00:51:02,015 --> 00:51:04,575
Next clip

986
00:51:06,879 --> 00:51:09,439
Come on

987
00:51:09,695 --> 00:51:15,839
He'll be running for congress as well

988
00:51:16,095 --> 00:51:18,655
What is what is b******* Kid Rock face

989
00:51:19,167 --> 00:51:20,447
Kid Rock

990
00:51:32,735 --> 00:51:37,087
North Korea missile

991
00:51:41,183 --> 00:51:44,255
Kill from

992
00:51:45,023 --> 00:51:46,559
Sure

993
00:51:46,815 --> 00:51:47,327
Newrez

994
00:51:58,847 --> 00:52:00,639
It goes on to say when show you

995
00:52:02,431 --> 00:52:03,967
An article right here in my stack

996
00:52:04,735 --> 00:52:06,015
Says we're going to kill him

997
00:52:13,951 --> 00:52:15,231
Disable Kill from

998
00:52:17,279 --> 00:52:22,399
This is the narrative from Friday that I wanted us to get much more in-depth in an hour

999
00:52:22,655 --> 00:52:23,167
Because it's too late

1000
00:52:23,423 --> 00:52:28,031
Who was on

1001
00:52:28,287 --> 00:52:33,407
Contributor to really weird interview with Stephen Colbert couple years back that says worth watching

1002
00:52:33,663 --> 00:52:34,175
Awkward

1003
00:52:34,431 --> 00:52:36,991
Colbert Report

1004
00:52:38,271 --> 00:52:39,807
He said that is

1005
00:52:40,831 --> 00:52:41,599
Basically

1006
00:52:43,135 --> 00:52:43,903
Trump

1007
00:52:44,159 --> 00:52:44,671
Is

1008
00:52:45,183 --> 00:52:46,463
Basically saying

1009
00:52:47,487 --> 00:52:48,511
Putin thanks

1010
00:52:49,023 --> 00:52:50,559
Thanks for taking our dudes out

1011
00:52:50,815 --> 00:52:52,095
Is a very bad

1012
00:52:52,351 --> 00:52:53,631
Driveway to govern

1013
00:52:54,655 --> 00:52:55,679
It's it's not good

1014
00:52:55,935 --> 00:52:57,471
And he said

1015
00:52:57,983 --> 00:52:59,007
They're going to kill him

1016
00:52:59,519 --> 00:53:00,799
The government's going to kill him

1017
00:53:01,055 --> 00:53:05,151
And then immediately the host I believe it was Tapper

1018
00:53:10,015 --> 00:53:12,575
So it's the same we take that out of context

1019
00:53:12,831 --> 00:53:13,343
Stand

1020
00:53:16,671 --> 00:53:18,719
Talk about how we're going to destroy you in

1021
00:53:18,975 --> 00:53:25,119
Award-giving the same

1022
00:53:25,375 --> 00:53:26,143
Accuracy means nothing

1023
00:53:26,655 --> 00:53:30,239
Every time you see anybody point out hypocrisies

1024
00:53:30,495 --> 00:53:31,007
C on the left

1025
00:53:31,519 --> 00:53:32,031
I feel like it

1026
00:53:34,591 --> 00:53:35,103
Nothing to

1027
00:53:38,175 --> 00:53:39,199
Who Revel

1028
00:53:41,503 --> 00:53:42,527
Did they can get away with her

1029
00:53:46,367 --> 00:53:48,671
He threatened to beat up Trey Gowdy

1030
00:53:49,183 --> 00:53:51,231
He's going to kick his teeth in and s***

1031
00:53:54,303 --> 00:53:58,655
You really at the Benghazi

1032
00:53:59,167 --> 00:54:02,495
The actual clip that that came from was

1033
00:54:02,751 --> 00:54:04,031
Philip Mudd

1034
00:54:04,543 --> 00:54:05,823
Someone should kick his ass

1035
00:54:06,079 --> 00:54:08,639
Because he's lying about

1036
00:54:09,919 --> 00:54:10,431
Open question

1037
00:54:10,943 --> 00:54:12,223
In Congress

1038
00:54:12,479 --> 00:54:17,087
None of that right but I'm going to kick his ass he doesn't like Alex ads all these like

1039
00:54:17,343 --> 00:54:22,463
Flourishes of kicking his teeth in and stuff like that that you didn't say

1040
00:54:22,719 --> 00:54:23,743
Because he knows better

1041
00:54:24,255 --> 00:54:28,863
He knows what he's doing he knows what he's willfully misleading people in Congressional question

1042
00:54:29,119 --> 00:54:30,655
Right

1043
00:54:31,167 --> 00:54:33,215
Sure it's a little bit 100%

1044
00:54:33,471 --> 00:54:33,983
Sure

1045
00:54:34,239 --> 00:54:38,335
A little aggressive

1046
00:54:38,591 --> 00:54:40,127
Cuz I am.

1047
00:54:40,383 --> 00:54:41,663
So I can workout

1048
00:54:46,783 --> 00:54:51,647
Will Ferrell Elizabeth

1049
00:54:59,839 --> 00:55:05,471
Addiction

1050
00:55:08,287 --> 00:55:09,055
So give me a second

1051
00:55:09,311 --> 00:55:10,847
The process that

1052
00:55:11,359 --> 00:55:14,431
They left it standing up against tyranny

1053
00:55:14,943 --> 00:55:15,967
Vietnam

1054
00:55:16,223 --> 00:55:17,503
Into a tyrannical possess

1055
00:55:18,015 --> 00:55:19,807
Well the that yeah the

1056
00:55:20,063 --> 00:55:22,111
The anti-war movement in the 70s

1057
00:55:22,367 --> 00:55:23,903
PlayStation 70 is was

1058
00:55:24,159 --> 00:55:24,671
The leftist

1059
00:55:24,927 --> 00:55:26,975
Trying to impugn the good name of America

1060
00:55:27,487 --> 00:55:29,535
And yes then that would bring a

1061
00:55:33,631 --> 00:55:39,775
What network

1062
00:55:43,359 --> 00:55:49,503
Makes less sense than everything else you said so far confidently so I don't

1063
00:55:49,759 --> 00:55:53,599
Listeners are going to pick up on how stupid it is

1064
00:55:53,855 --> 00:55:56,671
Fun

1065
00:55:56,927 --> 00:55:59,743
It's fun at least it's different than a lot of his other narratives

1066
00:56:01,279 --> 00:56:01,791
A good point

1067
00:56:02,047 --> 00:56:02,559
That's a good

1068
00:56:02,815 --> 00:56:06,655
It also

1069
00:56:06,911 --> 00:56:08,703
Even process it

1070
00:56:08,959 --> 00:56:11,263
Like if you believe this

1071
00:56:11,519 --> 00:56:17,663
We've been going over his ship for like a year he's never talked really about how it's been coordinated plan

1072
00:56:17,919 --> 00:56:24,063
The anti-war movement

1073
00:56:24,575 --> 00:56:26,111
Just f******

1074
00:56:26,367 --> 00:56:31,231
The brain Forest done got good to him

1075
00:56:34,047 --> 00:56:36,863
The outcome of what happened

1076
00:56:37,119 --> 00:56:39,423
From this the day of the movement

1077
00:56:40,959 --> 00:56:42,751
Nope

1078
00:56:43,007 --> 00:56:46,335
By the way called

1079
00:56:46,591 --> 00:56:48,639
Pure race war in America

1080
00:56:49,407 --> 00:56:52,479
Nope

1081
00:56:55,807 --> 00:56:56,575
People leaving it

1082
00:56:56,831 --> 00:56:59,903
Wichita

1083
00:57:04,255 --> 00:57:10,399
Automatic weapons

1084
00:57:20,383 --> 00:57:21,151
The coffee room

1085
00:57:26,015 --> 00:57:32,159
Seven Springs car races racism

1086
00:57:49,311 --> 00:57:55,455
The quote minority bring up the

1087
00:57:55,711 --> 00:58:00,063
Always

1088
00:58:02,111 --> 00:58:07,487
It's stupid for us to bring up at this point 100 episodes in very clear that it's the same thing

1089
00:58:08,767 --> 00:58:12,095
Globalist stuff is white nationalism in a different

1090
00:58:13,887 --> 00:58:14,911
And what have you

1091
00:58:17,983 --> 00:58:18,751
It's alright

1092
00:58:19,007 --> 00:58:22,079
Call misrepresenting what people are actually saying

1093
00:58:22,335 --> 00:58:23,359
It's great slot of fun

1094
00:58:24,639 --> 00:58:25,407
It's a lot of fun for him

1095
00:58:25,663 --> 00:58:30,271
I'm glad you can have this kind of fun everybody

1096
00:58:30,527 --> 00:58:31,295
Answer

1097
00:58:31,551 --> 00:58:32,063
Lit on fire

1098
00:58:33,343 --> 00:58:35,135
I wonder why do male Vitality is flammable

1099
00:58:38,719 --> 00:58:42,303
Do you do you understand because I don't I don't know why my voice

1100
00:58:42,559 --> 00:58:43,583
Just did

1101
00:58:44,095 --> 00:58:48,703
Ifucking Jeff Foxworthy right there understand

1102
00:58:52,799 --> 00:58:53,823
Why why do they

1103
00:58:54,079 --> 00:58:54,847
People find whiteness

1104
00:58:55,103 --> 00:58:56,127
Is to be so important

1105
00:58:58,943 --> 00:59:00,479
Because these guys were

1106
00:59:01,503 --> 00:59:02,015
Don't you dare

1107
00:59:02,527 --> 00:59:04,831
It's time for us to really get to the bottom of

1108
00:59:08,415 --> 00:59:09,439
I don't know why you're asking

1109
00:59:09,695 --> 00:59:10,975
What is

1110
00:59:11,231 --> 00:59:15,839
Because there's a history in America of white people being the only real voice

1111
00:59:16,095 --> 00:59:19,935
They're the only people

1112
00:59:20,191 --> 00:59:20,959
Comfortable position

1113
00:59:21,471 --> 00:59:21,983
And it becomes

1114
00:59:22,239 --> 00:59:26,079
Essentially what is the norm what you what you think you deserve

1115
00:59:26,591 --> 00:59:29,151
What you're entitled to it's what our grandfathers

1116
00:59:29,663 --> 00:59:31,711
I just masculinity and

1117
00:59:31,967 --> 00:59:33,247
Were the default Norm

1118
00:59:33,503 --> 00:59:35,039
And everything else has to be sued

1119
00:59:35,295 --> 00:59:36,319
Subservient to it after

1120
00:59:36,575 --> 00:59:38,623
You have to any any needs

1121
00:59:38,879 --> 00:59:40,159
Of marginalized groups

1122
00:59:40,415 --> 00:59:42,207
Come after the needs of white

1123
00:59:43,487 --> 00:59:45,279
It's what we talked about a bunch

1124
00:59:45,535 --> 00:59:46,047
In terms of

1125
00:59:46,815 --> 00:59:52,959
If you're used to a super powerful position ready balancing of the equation seems like

1126
00:59:54,495 --> 00:59:57,567
We talked about that as well in the past

1127
00:59:57,823 --> 00:59:59,871
But now I'm running out of

1128
01:00:03,711 --> 01:00:04,735
Why is it

1129
01:00:05,247 --> 01:00:07,039
Why is it that you and I

1130
01:00:08,575 --> 01:00:09,087
White

1131
01:00:09,343 --> 01:00:09,855
Mail

1132
01:00:10,111 --> 01:00:12,159
With all the same privileges as bees

1133
01:00:13,183 --> 01:00:14,463
And these guys aren't

1134
01:00:15,487 --> 01:00:17,535
Cuz you look at that

1135
01:00:20,607 --> 01:00:21,375
That's a big issue for

1136
01:00:21,631 --> 01:00:26,751
We've been exposed to very smart people

1137
01:00:27,007 --> 01:00:30,079
Exposed to people of other walks of life

1138
01:00:30,335 --> 01:00:30,847
Experiences

1139
01:00:31,103 --> 01:00:31,871
And instead of

1140
01:00:32,127 --> 01:00:38,271
Being like

1141
01:00:38,527 --> 01:00:39,807
People have we realized

1142
01:00:40,575 --> 01:00:41,599
Peoplescu my headache

1143
01:00:42,111 --> 01:00:44,927
I guess

1144
01:00:45,183 --> 01:00:47,231
Struggling with

1145
01:00:47,743 --> 01:00:50,815
Like like if it were cuz cuz the narrative for the longer

1146
01:00:52,607 --> 01:00:53,631
The same thing

1147
01:00:55,423 --> 01:00:56,703
Post Civil War recap

1148
01:01:01,055 --> 01:01:03,103
The only way that the white folk

1149
01:01:03,359 --> 01:01:05,151
Can feel good about them

1150
01:01:06,175 --> 01:01:07,199
And the only way that you can

1151
01:01:07,455 --> 01:01:09,247
Separate them so they don't

1152
01:01:09,503 --> 01:01:11,551
United murder the Richmond

1153
01:01:11,807 --> 01:01:12,319
People who are there

1154
01:01:12,575 --> 01:01:13,343
Who are the

1155
01:01:13,855 --> 01:01:15,135
Root cause of all of their

1156
01:01:15,647 --> 01:01:16,671
Right

1157
01:01:17,183 --> 01:01:18,463
To say that white people are better

1158
01:01:20,255 --> 01:01:21,023
What is a Taurus

1159
01:01:21,279 --> 01:01:21,791
White dude

1160
01:01:22,303 --> 01:01:23,327
Can say he's better than old

1161
01:01:24,863 --> 01:01:26,143
Read people

1162
01:01:27,679 --> 01:01:28,191
You and I

1163
01:01:28,703 --> 01:01:29,983
These guys are

1164
01:01:30,239 --> 01:01:32,031
Banana Republic

1165
01:01:32,287 --> 01:01:33,311
Which has its own Iran

1166
01:01:34,591 --> 01:01:35,359
There

1167
01:01:36,383 --> 01:01:37,919
They have no problem

1168
01:01:38,431 --> 01:01:39,199
These people have

1169
01:01:39,455 --> 01:01:40,223
Zero issues

1170
01:01:40,991 --> 01:01:42,527
They don't have anything to complain about

1171
01:01:42,783 --> 01:01:44,575
Is it was a homo

1172
01:01:45,599 --> 01:01:46,367
F****** nothing

1173
01:01:46,623 --> 01:01:48,415
Every part of their lives is great

1174
01:01:48,671 --> 01:01:49,951
They have no issues

1175
01:01:50,207 --> 01:01:50,975
But they

1176
01:01:51,231 --> 01:01:52,511
On some subconscious

1177
01:01:52,767 --> 01:01:55,071
Just level realize that the absence of their issues

1178
01:01:55,583 --> 01:01:56,607
Is a byproduct

1179
01:01:57,887 --> 01:01:58,655
The fact that

1180
01:01:58,911 --> 01:02:00,959
Played the role

1181
01:02:01,471 --> 01:02:05,055
Okay I believe that the fact that they have no real issues like

1182
01:02:05,567 --> 01:02:08,895
Minorities and women have faced in terms of systemic oppression

1183
01:02:09,663 --> 01:02:11,711
Violence directed towards them just for

1184
01:02:11,967 --> 01:02:12,479
Speakingout

1185
01:02:12,735 --> 01:02:13,247
And stuff like that

1186
01:02:13,503 --> 01:02:19,647
I think they start to fear that eventually they will be in the same position that they have put people in historically

1187
01:02:20,671 --> 01:02:21,695
Sub sub cons

1188
01:02:22,463 --> 01:02:23,231
Consciously

1189
01:02:23,487 --> 01:02:26,047
I don't know

1190
01:02:26,303 --> 01:02:27,327
Preemptively

1191
01:02:27,583 --> 01:02:28,863
Fighting against issues

1192
01:02:29,375 --> 01:02:30,143
They've never had to deal

1193
01:02:30,655 --> 01:02:36,799
Yes and that's why I think a lot of people in these groups are like eventually will be a minority and that scares them so

1194
01:02:37,055 --> 01:02:39,359
To deal with the

1195
01:02:40,383 --> 01:02:41,663
Repercussions of Iraq

1196
01:02:41,919 --> 01:02:43,455
Actions web we weave

1197
01:02:43,967 --> 01:02:45,503
But not weed but like they would

1198
01:02:45,759 --> 01:02:47,039
Say I believe that

1199
01:02:48,063 --> 01:02:50,623
Eventually we will be on the business end

1200
01:02:50,879 --> 01:02:51,903
That which we have done

1201
01:02:57,535 --> 01:02:58,303
Again

1202
01:03:00,095 --> 01:03:00,863
No on white.

1203
01:03:03,167 --> 01:03:06,495
I'm just I'm just starting to lean towards

1204
01:03:07,263 --> 01:03:08,543
The ideas

1205
01:03:08,799 --> 01:03:09,311
Isn't

1206
01:03:10,079 --> 01:03:11,359
This isn't anything

1207
01:03:11,615 --> 01:03:12,127
But

1208
01:03:12,895 --> 01:03:14,943
I just don't know where to find

1209
01:03:16,223 --> 01:03:18,271
Like I'm starting to lean towards

1210
01:03:18,527 --> 01:03:20,063
This is the only social group

1211
01:03:20,575 --> 01:03:22,367
I'm the same way with Christy

1212
01:03:23,135 --> 01:03:24,159
A lot of Christian

1213
01:03:25,183 --> 01:03:26,207
Ghibah

1214
01:03:27,231 --> 01:03:30,303
Don't give a f*** about the Bible don't care about Christ

1215
01:03:30,559 --> 01:03:32,351
They just don't have anything but the

1216
01:03:32,863 --> 01:03:33,887
That's all

1217
01:03:34,655 --> 01:03:37,471
So to me I'm starting to get the the

1218
01:03:37,727 --> 01:03:38,239
Feeling that

1219
01:03:38,495 --> 01:03:39,007
None of this is

1220
01:03:39,775 --> 01:03:41,055
And all of it is

1221
01:03:41,567 --> 01:03:42,591
I depressed

1222
01:03:43,103 --> 01:03:43,871
Lonely

1223
01:03:44,895 --> 01:03:49,247
White people who feel like they have nothing else going on who feel like their lives there meaning

1224
01:03:50,015 --> 01:03:52,063
And this is the only way they can find me

1225
01:03:52,575 --> 01:03:53,343
That's that's

1226
01:03:53,599 --> 01:03:54,623
You engaging

1227
01:03:54,879 --> 01:03:56,927
And some sort of intellectual self-defense

1228
01:03:57,439 --> 01:03:58,975
Because the reality is so much

1229
01:03:59,231 --> 01:03:59,999
Exterior morphine

1230
01:04:00,511 --> 01:04:01,023
Probably

1231
01:04:01,535 --> 01:04:02,815
I think that you're rationalizing

1232
01:04:03,071 --> 01:04:03,583
Sing for them

1233
01:04:03,839 --> 01:04:05,887
Thank you for that

1234
01:04:06,399 --> 01:04:12,543
Because you're you're absolutely right. Just a better position to be in

1235
01:04:12,799 --> 01:04:15,103
Quite frankly because it's humanizing

1236
01:04:15,359 --> 01:04:18,687
You're not to blame this early for your actions just looking for love

1237
01:04:18,943 --> 01:04:24,063
You're looking for a you're looking for acceptance you're looking for something that gives your life

1238
01:04:24,319 --> 01:04:27,135
A feeling of meaning whereas the reality is

1239
01:04:27,391 --> 01:04:28,415
A lot of these people

1240
01:04:28,671 --> 01:04:30,719
Legit f****** hate people

1241
01:04:30,975 --> 01:04:31,487
I

1242
01:04:31,999 --> 01:04:35,327
Can't believe that this many people are true and honest

1243
01:04:35,839 --> 01:04:36,351
Psychopath

1244
01:04:37,631 --> 01:04:38,143
I got bad news

1245
01:04:40,959 --> 01:04:44,543
August

1246
01:04:44,799 --> 01:04:46,847
And psychologists said that it's like

1247
01:04:47,103 --> 01:04:51,199
What percent of the population of psychopaths

1248
01:04:51,455 --> 01:04:54,527
And these people sure make it look like 20% of the population

1249
01:04:55,039 --> 01:04:56,575
Pure psychopathy

1250
01:04:56,831 --> 01:05:02,975
2hype if you have that 1% within my 1% is going to be I don't know.

1251
01:05:03,231 --> 01:05:05,023
20% of the 1% that are

1252
01:05:05,279 --> 01:05:09,887
Incredibly charismatic and are able to lure people into their psychopathy

1253
01:05:10,143 --> 01:05:12,191
I just buy almost like by proxy

1254
01:05:12,703 --> 01:05:13,727
You'll have

1255
01:05:13,983 --> 01:05:16,287
Cult leader types within that 1%

1256
01:05:16,543 --> 01:05:18,335
And you have people who would otherwise be

1257
01:05:18,847 --> 01:05:23,199
Maybe reasonable people baby people who could you do a different path and unfortunately

1258
01:05:24,223 --> 01:05:25,247
Workout

1259
01:05:25,503 --> 01:05:27,807
Functionally psychopath

1260
01:05:28,575 --> 01:05:29,087
Mark Marlowe

1261
01:05:29,343 --> 01:05:30,879
That's really what it is like

1262
01:05:31,135 --> 01:05:33,951
How did so many Nazis

1263
01:05:34,975 --> 01:05:35,487
Just

1264
01:05:35,999 --> 01:05:36,511
Watch

1265
01:05:37,023 --> 01:05:38,047
People go into an oven

1266
01:05:38,303 --> 01:05:39,583
Yeah like that's

1267
01:05:40,095 --> 01:05:43,423
That's what these people are

1268
01:05:43,679 --> 01:05:44,447
They're good

1269
01:05:44,703 --> 01:05:45,983
They're people who are

1270
01:05:46,495 --> 01:05:47,007
Pudding

1271
01:05:47,519 --> 01:05:48,287
Putting people in

1272
01:05:49,055 --> 01:05:51,359
Yeah

1273
01:05:51,615 --> 01:05:53,919
I want that to be hyperbole.

1274
01:05:54,175 --> 01:05:54,943
To be hyperbole

1275
01:05:55,199 --> 01:05:56,223
And it's f****** not

1276
01:05:58,783 --> 01:06:02,623
I can move along cuz you

1277
01:06:02,879 --> 01:06:07,231
For this long

1278
01:06:07,487 --> 01:06:11,839
There was the lady who got killed by a car and 9th

1279
01:06:12,351 --> 01:06:12,863
20

1280
01:06:13,119 --> 01:06:13,887
Something people injured

1281
01:06:14,143 --> 01:06:17,215
I believe the numbers are a little bit too they very

1282
01:06:17,471 --> 01:06:18,239
Based on sources

1283
01:06:18,751 --> 01:06:20,031
But Alex

1284
01:06:20,287 --> 01:06:23,103
Sort of learned during this next clip

1285
01:06:23,359 --> 01:06:25,151
He pretends that he's well aware of it

1286
01:06:30,527 --> 01:06:33,087
What

1287
01:06:47,679 --> 01:06:51,519
F*** you

1288
01:06:51,775 --> 01:06:53,055
They were racist

1289
01:06:56,895 --> 01:06:59,455
So you can

1290
01:07:10,463 --> 01:07:12,255
Because this is home

1291
01:07:17,887 --> 01:07:21,727
I'm projecting again

1292
01:07:21,983 --> 01:07:24,031
Wind of these all tonight

1293
01:07:24,543 --> 01:07:28,127
Are all these people whenever they beat up people

1294
01:07:28,383 --> 01:07:29,407
Soros paid shill

1295
01:07:29,663 --> 01:07:32,991
Right

1296
01:07:33,247 --> 01:07:36,831
These all these Nazi folks

1297
01:07:37,599 --> 01:07:39,391
It's it's not that

1298
01:07:40,159 --> 01:07:40,927
Really fighting

1299
01:07:41,183 --> 01:07:41,695
Hard

1300
01:07:41,951 --> 01:07:42,719
Because

1301
01:07:44,511 --> 01:07:46,303
This is

1302
01:07:46,559 --> 01:07:47,071
Is the biggest shoe

1303
01:07:47,327 --> 01:07:47,839
For Alex

1304
01:07:49,119 --> 01:07:49,631
Is that

1305
01:07:50,655 --> 01:07:51,423
No longer

1306
01:07:51,679 --> 01:07:52,703
Can you say anything

1307
01:07:52,959 --> 01:07:53,471
Sing but the

1308
01:07:53,727 --> 01:07:54,239
These guys are at

1309
01:07:55,263 --> 01:08:01,407
Like before you could say all of their the alt-right Trump directly

1310
01:08:01,663 --> 01:08:03,711
Screaming blood

1311
01:08:05,247 --> 01:08:09,343
Just out-and-out Nazis

1312
01:08:09,855 --> 01:08:11,135
Oh they're all right

1313
01:08:11,647 --> 01:08:13,183
F****** Mike cernovich

1314
01:08:13,695 --> 01:08:19,839
Light bulb

1315
01:08:22,399 --> 01:08:28,031
Tucker Gavin McInnes was light games

1316
01:08:34,431 --> 01:08:35,199
So this is

1317
01:08:35,455 --> 01:08:39,551
This is his problem is that there's no longer any

1318
01:08:40,063 --> 01:08:41,599
There's no longer any

1319
01:08:43,647 --> 01:08:44,159
Distance

1320
01:08:44,415 --> 01:08:45,183
Between

1321
01:08:45,439 --> 01:08:45,951
What

1322
01:08:46,207 --> 01:08:47,487
They used to call the alt-right

1323
01:08:47,743 --> 01:08:53,887
Nothing very clear what's going on

1324
01:08:55,167 --> 01:08:56,703
The conservative movement were

1325
01:08:57,727 --> 01:08:58,239
Literal

1326
01:08:58,495 --> 01:09:01,567
Which is why I think it's important

1327
01:09:01,823 --> 01:09:03,103
To recognize

1328
01:09:03,615 --> 01:09:05,407
Appreciate the fact that there are

1329
01:09:05,663 --> 01:09:07,199
Reasonable Republican

1330
01:09:07,455 --> 01:09:09,247
Conservative-minded citizen

1331
01:09:09,759 --> 01:09:12,063
Because otherwise we run the risk

1332
01:09:12,319 --> 01:09:14,623
Of conflating

1333
01:09:14,879 --> 01:09:15,903
You know like weekly

1334
01:09:16,159 --> 01:09:18,207
We run the risk of being as

1335
01:09:18,719 --> 01:09:19,999
Intellectually dishonest

1336
01:09:20,255 --> 01:09:21,279
Simplistic as Alex

1337
01:09:21,791 --> 01:09:24,095
Yeah that I don't want us to ever fall into that Gap

1338
01:09:24,351 --> 01:09:25,119
No you're right

1339
01:09:25,375 --> 01:09:29,471
There's plenty of room for intellectual and political disagreement

1340
01:09:29,727 --> 01:09:30,495
Among adults

1341
01:09:30,751 --> 01:09:31,775
There's not room

1342
01:09:32,287 --> 01:09:35,615
No I know and I

1343
01:09:35,871 --> 01:09:36,383
I

1344
01:09:37,919 --> 01:09:38,687
Make

1345
01:09:38,943 --> 01:09:39,711
Taking me

1346
01:09:39,967 --> 01:09:42,783
Realized

1347
01:09:46,111 --> 01:09:46,623
I just

1348
01:09:46,879 --> 01:09:47,903
I just wish I could

1349
01:09:48,415 --> 01:09:50,207
Tap into their unchecked

1350
01:09:50,975 --> 01:09:52,255
Unhinged

1351
01:09:54,047 --> 01:09:58,399
Because when I don't feel it but I've got trouble reading all the stuff on these message boards

1352
01:09:58,655 --> 01:10:01,471
She like that

1353
01:10:02,495 --> 01:10:03,263
It's childish

1354
01:10:05,055 --> 01:10:07,871
Like

1355
01:10:08,639 --> 01:10:10,175
Like these people like

1356
01:10:10,431 --> 01:10:12,735
Here scream all the time

1357
01:10:12,991 --> 01:10:15,039
Literal

1358
01:10:16,319 --> 01:10:16,831
Murdered

1359
01:10:17,343 --> 01:10:18,111
Heather

1360
01:10:18,367 --> 01:10:18,879
Hair

1361
01:10:19,135 --> 01:10:19,647
Higher

1362
01:10:20,159 --> 01:10:23,743
However you pronounce her name I haven't heard it pronounce out loud

1363
01:10:23,999 --> 01:10:24,767
That's why I don't

1364
01:10:25,279 --> 01:10:25,791
I don't know when

1365
01:10:27,583 --> 01:10:28,095
Is her name

1366
01:10:28,607 --> 01:10:29,119
She was

1367
01:10:29,375 --> 01:10:29,887
Murdered

1368
01:10:31,935 --> 01:10:32,703
Literally

1369
01:10:33,215 --> 01:10:34,751
A victim of WWII

1370
01:10:36,031 --> 01:10:39,615
Like this is the world that were in

1371
01:10:41,151 --> 01:10:42,687
Like I don't get to

1372
01:10:42,943 --> 01:10:44,991
Experience that level of

1373
01:10:46,527 --> 01:10:47,295
Unhinged

1374
01:10:49,599 --> 01:10:51,391
No but now we have now

1375
01:10:51,647 --> 01:10:52,159
To be the Opera

1376
01:10:52,671 --> 01:10:54,207
Yeah exactly

1377
01:10:54,719 --> 01:10:57,791
I want to I want to come back

1378
01:10:58,047 --> 01:10:58,559
I'm on their level

1379
01:10:59,071 --> 01:11:00,095
In the same way that

1380
01:11:00,351 --> 01:11:01,631
During the campaign

1381
01:11:11,615 --> 01:11:13,151
It's that

1382
01:11:14,175 --> 01:11:14,687
During the

1383
01:11:14,943 --> 01:11:16,735
Campaign is like when they go low we go high

1384
01:11:17,503 --> 01:11:18,783
And it's like

1385
01:11:19,039 --> 01:11:19,551
Maybe

1386
01:11:19,807 --> 01:11:20,319
We should have been

1387
01:11:20,831 --> 01:11:23,391
No

1388
01:11:23,903 --> 01:11:27,231
Not not you and I we don't want to start lying

1389
01:11:27,487 --> 01:11:29,535
Creating false narratives

1390
01:11:29,791 --> 01:11:30,559
No I don't want

1391
01:11:30,815 --> 01:11:33,887
We don't want to become propaganda in and of ourselves

1392
01:11:34,143 --> 01:11:36,191
But I do agree with you in the sense that I'd like to

1393
01:11:37,215 --> 01:11:38,495
Some people

1394
01:11:43,103 --> 01:11:46,431
Thought not. But you're engaging in propaganda but like I do I don't

1395
01:11:46,687 --> 01:11:47,967
See a lot of problems with beating up now

1396
01:11:49,503 --> 01:11:51,039
I feel like at a certain

1397
01:11:51,295 --> 01:11:51,807
Point

1398
01:11:52,319 --> 01:11:53,599
We are we made

1399
01:11:53,855 --> 01:11:55,135
Peace with Germany we didn't make peace

1400
01:11:55,903 --> 01:11:58,207
Like we're still at war with Nazi

1401
01:11:58,463 --> 01:12:01,279
Weirdly Alex Jones is totally cool with Nazis

1402
01:12:01,535 --> 01:12:04,095
I hate Angela Merkel

1403
01:12:05,375 --> 01:12:09,727
Terminate Germany Macy's with us

1404
01:12:09,983 --> 01:12:14,335
Nazis didn't give up WWII in the same way that the Confederates didn't give up the civil

1405
01:12:19,199 --> 01:12:24,575
So let's get to the point where the car murder the people who lost Wars against America

1406
01:12:25,087 --> 01:12:25,599
Still trying

1407
01:12:25,855 --> 01:12:26,367
Yeah

1408
01:12:26,879 --> 01:12:28,671
Winning right now

1409
01:12:29,951 --> 01:12:30,719
A Bad season

1410
01:12:30,975 --> 01:12:34,815
But be that as it may I hear we're going to get to the point where the car murder actually

1411
01:12:38,399 --> 01:12:43,007
Within 30 minutes

1412
01:12:49,151 --> 01:12:53,503
Drove through protesters

1413
01:12:53,759 --> 01:12:55,039
Tuacahn in Saint Agnes

1414
01:13:01,695 --> 01:13:05,791
Josie the antifa

1415
01:13:06,303 --> 01:13:12,447
Nope

1416
01:13:18,079 --> 01:13:19,359
F*** you

1417
01:13:20,383 --> 01:13:25,503
F*** you

1418
01:13:25,759 --> 01:13:30,879
They want to kill Trump

1419
01:13:31,391 --> 01:13:33,695
Put in a building

1420
01:13:34,719 --> 01:13:35,999
Martial law

1421
01:13:37,535 --> 01:13:40,351
Because they're alive

1422
01:13:41,631 --> 01:13:42,143
Where the police

1423
01:13:42,399 --> 01:13:45,215
Don't trust her

1424
01:13:49,567 --> 01:13:51,871
Costco

1425
01:13:52,127 --> 01:13:54,175
Designated

1426
01:13:54,431 --> 01:13:55,967
Again that goes back to permit

1427
01:13:56,223 --> 01:13:59,807
I'd like to get into now this gentleman I was just being way too

1428
01:14:00,063 --> 01:14:02,367
Too fair to him by the name of James Alex fields

1429
01:14:02,879 --> 01:14:03,903
He is

1430
01:14:04,159 --> 01:14:05,695
Has been arrested

1431
01:14:05,951 --> 01:14:06,719
Batgirl

1432
01:14:06,975 --> 01:14:08,255
Is the guy who murdered Heather

1433
01:14:09,535 --> 01:14:15,423
And it's kind of interesting looking at pictures of him

1434
01:14:15,679 --> 01:14:18,495
Cuz he was are protesting in the uniform

1435
01:14:18,751 --> 01:14:20,031
Vanguard America

1436
01:14:21,567 --> 01:14:23,359
And the white polo

1437
01:14:23,615 --> 01:14:26,943
Part of their organization

1438
01:14:27,199 --> 01:14:29,759
He was also pictured carrying one of their scope

1439
01:14:30,271 --> 01:14:31,807
Logo on it

1440
01:14:32,063 --> 01:14:33,087
Shield

1441
01:14:33,343 --> 01:14:37,695
Tell me what their logo is a lot of Education

1442
01:14:38,975 --> 01:14:40,767
Affiliated

1443
01:14:41,023 --> 01:14:44,351
Whether or not he was a leader in the group or whatever it's kind of irrelevant

1444
01:14:44,863 --> 01:14:47,935
I don't believe that if you're examined Streisand like this you'd be carrying

1445
01:14:48,191 --> 01:14:50,495
You're not down with Shield

1446
01:14:50,751 --> 01:14:56,127
Around a bunch of people

1447
01:14:56,383 --> 01:14:58,431
You're probably a very radical person

1448
01:15:00,479 --> 01:15:02,015
Looking into Vanguard America

1449
01:15:03,551 --> 01:15:04,319
Parentage testing organization

1450
01:15:05,087 --> 01:15:07,135
I mean incredibly boring

1451
01:15:11,231 --> 01:15:11,999
A large group of

1452
01:15:12,767 --> 01:15:14,815
Because it's elections at Large

1453
01:15:15,327 --> 01:15:15,839
Okay fine

1454
01:15:16,095 --> 01:15:16,863
Call Griffith

1455
01:15:17,119 --> 01:15:18,911
Lookout

1456
01:15:19,167 --> 01:15:21,215
Spells let's say in a bunch of

1457
01:15:22,495 --> 01:15:23,007
Birthright America

1458
01:15:24,031 --> 01:15:25,055
Proud boys

1459
01:15:27,871 --> 01:15:29,407
So

1460
01:15:29,919 --> 01:15:31,967
Sing that we've been like

1461
01:15:32,223 --> 01:15:33,247
We've made this point

1462
01:15:33,503 --> 01:15:34,015
In the past that

1463
01:15:34,527 --> 01:15:35,039
Isis

1464
01:15:36,063 --> 01:15:37,087
Does not scare me at all

1465
01:15:38,111 --> 01:15:38,623
It is

1466
01:15:39,135 --> 01:15:39,647
White supremacy

1467
01:15:40,415 --> 01:15:41,183
Who are

1468
01:15:43,231 --> 01:15:46,559
Play couple weeks people ask me a number of times what I think is going to happen

1469
01:15:46,815 --> 01:15:47,839
And I

1470
01:15:48,095 --> 01:15:50,911
Every indication that I can tell

1471
01:15:51,167 --> 01:15:52,447
Seem to be going I think we're going to

1472
01:15:52,703 --> 01:15:53,215
Essentially

1473
01:15:53,727 --> 01:15:56,031
I'm Isis like Insurgency rise up

1474
01:15:56,287 --> 01:15:59,103
You're going to see a lot of this Loosely Affiliated groups

1475
01:15:59,615 --> 01:16:01,407
Of Nazis and white nationalists

1476
01:16:01,919 --> 01:16:03,455
Are going to start

1477
01:16:03,711 --> 01:16:05,759
Bombing South they're going to start

1478
01:16:08,319 --> 01:16:12,415
Yeah I think that's what's going to happen I'll be glad to be wrong

1479
01:16:12,927 --> 01:16:13,439
Scary part

1480
01:16:15,487 --> 01:16:16,255
I don't know

1481
01:16:17,023 --> 01:16:17,535
To hide

1482
01:16:18,303 --> 01:16:19,071
Military and

1483
01:16:19,583 --> 01:16:20,863
National Garden

1484
01:16:21,375 --> 01:16:23,935
Are going to be on to hope for the best

1485
01:16:25,983 --> 01:16:26,751
The FBI has been

1486
01:16:27,007 --> 01:16:27,519
Investigator

1487
01:16:29,311 --> 01:16:29,823
All of

1488
01:16:30,079 --> 01:16:30,847
The White Knight

1489
01:16:31,615 --> 01:16:32,639
Infiltration of our lungs

1490
01:16:33,151 --> 01:16:35,455
In the same way that the Scientologist

1491
01:16:35,967 --> 01:16:36,479
Angel traded

1492
01:16:37,503 --> 01:16:38,015
The

1493
01:16:39,551 --> 01:16:41,087
IRS

1494
01:16:41,599 --> 01:16:47,743
I think that they're obviously is infiltration but I do believe it

1495
01:16:47,999 --> 01:16:49,535
It's not as bad as

1496
01:16:49,791 --> 01:16:50,559
We might be afraid it is

1497
01:16:50,815 --> 01:16:52,351
I don't know we'll find out

1498
01:16:52,607 --> 01:16:53,119
What

1499
01:16:56,191 --> 01:16:57,983
You can go to Vanguard America's webs

1500
01:16:58,495 --> 01:16:59,263
They have a website

1501
01:16:59,519 --> 01:17:01,823
Published a Manifesto

1502
01:17:08,991 --> 01:17:11,551
With groups like

1503
01:17:11,807 --> 01:17:13,087
To talk about them being alike

1504
01:17:13,343 --> 01:17:14,623
Steak and what have you

1505
01:17:15,391 --> 01:17:16,671
You got to look at their history

1506
01:17:16,927 --> 01:17:22,559
Quite a while and they legit do have a Manifesto of what they believe in

1507
01:17:22,815 --> 01:17:24,095
Very publicly available

1508
01:17:24,607 --> 01:17:26,143
And there are very strong indication

1509
01:17:26,399 --> 01:17:28,191
Convert this James Alex Fields Jr

1510
01:17:28,447 --> 01:17:30,239
Was at least in some way

1511
01:17:30,495 --> 01:17:31,007
Involved

1512
01:17:31,775 --> 01:17:33,823
It is worth our time

1513
01:17:34,079 --> 01:17:36,127
To look at the manifesto

1514
01:17:38,687 --> 01:17:40,735
Alex Jones

1515
01:17:41,247 --> 01:17:41,759
Okay

1516
01:17:43,551 --> 01:17:46,367
The Damage Done to this nation and its people will not be fix

1517
01:17:46,623 --> 01:17:48,159
If every issue requires a vote

1518
01:17:48,415 --> 01:17:51,231
If every Point must be debated disgusting deliberate

1519
01:17:51,487 --> 01:17:54,303
Pawn democracy has failed in this once great nation

1520
01:17:54,815 --> 01:17:58,655
Now for the time of a new Caesar to revive the American Spirit has.

1521
01:17:59,167 --> 01:17:59,679
At the light

1522
01:18:01,983 --> 01:18:08,127
Everybody make mistakes

1523
01:18:08,383 --> 01:18:08,895
Absorb

1524
01:18:09,151 --> 01:18:09,663
Our Caesar

1525
01:18:10,175 --> 01:18:14,783
Sort of similar to not quite like on the head it's not it's not a bullseye

1526
01:18:15,551 --> 01:18:18,879
In America based on the immutable truths of blood and soil

1527
01:18:19,135 --> 01:18:25,279
A multicultural nation is no Nation at all but a collection

1528
01:18:25,535 --> 01:18:30,143
Allstate America is to be a nation exclusively for white American people

1529
01:18:30,655 --> 01:18:33,471
Who out of the barren Hills empty planes invest Mountain

1530
01:18:33,727 --> 01:18:36,031
Forge the most powerful Nation to have ever exist

1531
01:18:37,055 --> 01:18:37,567
That's bulshit

1532
01:18:37,823 --> 01:18:39,359
That's a historical bulshit

1533
01:18:39,615 --> 01:18:41,151
But if it is

1534
01:18:41,407 --> 01:18:42,431
Very similar to

1535
01:18:42,687 --> 01:18:47,039
Are Prosperity coming and what have you making America great again

1536
01:18:51,647 --> 01:18:52,927
The West

1537
01:18:54,207 --> 01:18:57,023
Vanguard America stands indomitable opposed

1538
01:18:57,279 --> 01:18:58,559
To the tyranny of globalism

1539
01:19:02,399 --> 01:19:03,935
Great great

1540
01:19:04,191 --> 01:19:09,055
I love it Dan I'm not sure if I actually said this was a Manifesto is titled American fashion

1541
01:19:09,823 --> 01:19:10,335
So that's great

1542
01:19:11,871 --> 01:19:18,015
The ideal structure of a family is one which is

1543
01:19:18,271 --> 01:19:21,855
Working father and nurturing mother in still strong values in the children

1544
01:19:22,367 --> 01:19:26,975
This family structure is and it's proven to be the strong foundation for Any Nation

1545
01:19:27,231 --> 01:19:30,815
Any assault on the family must be met with Swift and decisive Act

1546
01:19:32,351 --> 01:19:34,655
I'll Jones always talk about how people are trying to destroy

1547
01:19:34,911 --> 01:19:41,055
The family mother and father boy and girl

1548
01:19:41,311 --> 01:19:47,455
Snowflake

1549
01:19:47,711 --> 01:19:49,759
Cowards

1550
01:19:51,295 --> 01:19:52,575
The Vanguard

1551
01:19:52,831 --> 01:19:55,135
Whatever the f*** their goddamn name is

1552
01:19:55,391 --> 01:19:55,903
The murderer

1553
01:19:56,415 --> 01:19:57,951
The murderers of Heather heyer

1554
01:19:58,207 --> 01:19:58,975
Higher

1555
01:19:59,231 --> 01:20:00,511
Whichever it is

1556
01:20:00,767 --> 01:20:03,839
I love that they don't even have the balls of Isis

1557
01:20:05,631 --> 01:20:06,399
They do

1558
01:20:06,655 --> 01:20:11,519
They said that he wasn't claim him

1559
01:20:12,031 --> 01:20:18,176
Might as well come out and claimed that he was one of them all these terrorists

1560
01:20:18,432 --> 01:20:24,576
Exactly

1561
01:20:27,904 --> 01:20:28,416
I mean that

1562
01:20:28,672 --> 01:20:29,184
That speaks

1563
01:20:29,440 --> 01:20:30,976
To the third of cowardly

1564
01:20:31,232 --> 01:20:32,768
Hiding of the people

1565
01:20:35,584 --> 01:20:39,680
Existed online for a long time and are only now starting to creep their toes

1566
01:20:39,936 --> 01:20:44,032
Into actually public because they are

1567
01:20:44,288 --> 01:20:50,432
People realize that if he claimed him

1568
01:20:51,456 --> 01:20:52,224
And not with his Justice

1569
01:20:52,480 --> 01:20:54,016
Department

1570
01:20:54,272 --> 01:20:55,808
Yeah I'm glad that

1571
01:20:56,064 --> 01:21:01,184
This department is led by

1572
01:21:01,440 --> 01:21:07,584
Just sessions did say if they're going to invest

1573
01:21:08,608 --> 01:21:10,400
F****** on the case

1574
01:21:10,656 --> 01:21:15,776
That ends up Mitch McConnell is on the f****** case

1575
01:21:16,032 --> 01:21:19,104
Never a great time when Paul Ryan gets

1576
01:21:19,360 --> 01:21:23,968
The sound reasonable

1577
01:21:24,224 --> 01:21:27,040
Americans should strive for a truly National economy

1578
01:21:27,296 --> 01:21:31,392
That economy that is self-contained and free from the influence of international corporation

1579
01:21:31,648 --> 01:21:34,720
Light by rootless groups of international Jews

1580
01:21:34,976 --> 01:21:38,560
Which place Prophet beyond the interest of our people or any people

1581
01:21:40,096 --> 01:21:41,632
Globulin

1582
01:21:41,888 --> 01:21:43,168
The Elders of Zion

1583
01:21:43,424 --> 01:21:46,752
The large multinational yeah they are

1584
01:21:47,008 --> 01:21:50,848
Be large multinational corporations that have bled this nation dry will not be allowed to

1585
01:21:51,104 --> 01:21:53,152
Continue their detrimental efforts unabated

1586
01:21:53,408 --> 01:21:58,528
Once they're brought to heel it on the whims of the vestige

1587
01:21:58,784 --> 01:22:02,368
Our jobs or industry will not be exported to foreign Nations

1588
01:22:02,624 --> 01:22:06,976
And the media Industries will no longer be allowed to poison the minds of our people

1589
01:22:07,488 --> 01:22:08,000
Sure

1590
01:22:08,256 --> 01:22:09,024
That sounds very

1591
01:22:10,816 --> 01:22:11,840
Looks like they guys

1592
01:22:15,168 --> 01:22:21,056
I know that Alex would never want to look into this stuff because again it would be terrifying to look into the mirror and realize

1593
01:22:21,312 --> 01:22:24,384
That these people who are out there and are Nazis

1594
01:22:24,640 --> 01:22:27,968
Believe the song believe the same

1595
01:22:28,480 --> 01:22:29,248
That is tough

1596
01:22:29,504 --> 01:22:30,528
That's got to be tough

1597
01:22:30,784 --> 01:22:31,296
80-in

1598
01:22:31,552 --> 01:22:33,344
Wrestling without

1599
01:22:33,856 --> 01:22:38,720
Maybe a lot of the stuff I believe is not healthy is not good isn't based on reality

1600
01:22:38,976 --> 01:22:40,000
I'm certain that you just like

1601
01:22:40,256 --> 01:22:45,888
Oh well the Southern Poverty Law Center evil Fox and all this UPS.

1602
01:22:46,144 --> 01:22:51,520

Blacklivesmatter website Manifesto

1604
01:22:58,432 --> 01:23:01,248
Come on. I'm exhausted already

1605
01:23:01,504 --> 01:23:03,808
We have so much to get through

1606
01:23:04,064 --> 01:23:04,832
We are

1607
01:23:05,088 --> 01:23:05,600
Let's

1608
01:23:06,112 --> 01:23:09,952
Six clips in other out of 20

1609
01:23:10,464 --> 01:23:11,232
So

1610
01:23:11,488 --> 01:23:17,120
I need to be silent for the next eight Clips otherwise we're going to be at 6 hours

1611
01:23:19,936 --> 01:23:20,448
Two clips

1612
01:23:20,704 --> 01:23:22,240
Another one of our patented

1613
01:23:22,496 --> 01:23:23,776
Shot and chaser

1614
01:23:24,288 --> 01:23:26,080
The first one

1615
01:23:27,104 --> 01:23:28,896
If it's mostly about how antifa sucks

1616
01:23:29,152 --> 01:23:31,200
Discusses various City

1617
01:23:39,904 --> 01:23:41,440
Costco

1618

Can't come back through here to women children and Anna

1619
01:23:46,304 --> 01:23:46,816
Call Edwin

1620
01:23:55,008 --> 01:23:56,032
People got pissed

1621
01:23:56,288 --> 01:23:56,800
Who made it

1622
01:23:57,056 --> 01:23:59,104
That's what happened

1623
01:23:59,360 --> 01:24:05,504
Do you watch Game of Thrones

1624
01:24:05,760 --> 01:24:08,576
Are they Valyrian steel

1625
01:24:11,392 --> 01:24:11,904
Stop

1626
01:24:13,440 --> 01:24:16,256
Illegitimate free-speech you can't beat cutting taxes

1627
01:24:16,512 --> 01:24:21,376
Sandia prep table

1628
01:24:21,632 --> 01:24:22,400
Deep state

1629
01:24:23,424 --> 01:24:23,936
Hillary

1630
01:24:24,192 --> 01:24:25,472
Yeah yeah

1631
01:24:28,544 --> 01:24:29,056
Faucet

1632
01:24:36,736 --> 01:24:40,064
In Civil War in civil insurrection

1633
01:24:40,320 --> 01:24:41,600
City

1634
01:24:41,856 --> 01:24:44,160
Cleveland

1635
01:24:44,416 --> 01:24:47,488
Liberal conservative area blue collar

1636
01:24:52,608 --> 01:24:54,656
Everybody

1637
01:24:56,192 --> 01:25:02,336
So let's ignore the rest of the stuff of the beginning cuz there's a bunch of boring nonsense

1638
01:25:02,592 --> 01:25:05,920
What was the Ohio

1639
01:25:06,176 --> 01:25:06,944
Why does he think

1640
01:25:07,456 --> 01:25:09,504
These are the RNC because it was a

1641
01:25:09,760 --> 01:25:11,040
Do it like a Republican

1642
01:25:11,296 --> 01:25:12,320
So it wasn't

1643
01:25:12,576 --> 01:25:14,624
That's way of the globalist and what have you

1644
01:25:19,232 --> 01:25:21,792
Charlottesville in Virginia

1645
01:25:22,048 --> 01:25:23,584
Going to be f****** messy

1646
01:25:23,840 --> 01:25:26,144
They're going to set you up in Cleveland

1647
01:25:26,400 --> 01:25:28,448
Cuz I just want

1648
01:25:28,704 --> 01:25:34,848
It's totally fine now listen to this from maybe 10 minutes later

1649
01:25:41,504 --> 01:25:45,088
Cleveland

1650
01:25:49,440 --> 01:25:52,768
The reason it was different was because it was the same

1651
01:25:53,792 --> 01:25:59,936
Does that make sense

1652
01:26:00,192 --> 01:26:05,824
Scary just saying nonsense he wants to make our

1653
01:26:09,664 --> 01:26:10,688
Even like

1654
01:26:11,200 --> 01:26:15,296
I do like the fact that he's got nothing and he has no right

1655
01:26:15,552 --> 01:26:17,344
Because unlike these

1656
01:26:17,600 --> 01:26:18,112
F******

1657
01:26:18,368 --> 01:26:19,136
Tiles of s***

1658
01:26:19,648 --> 01:26:21,184
Republican

1659
01:26:21,440 --> 01:26:24,256
Paul Ryan rhinos

1660
01:26:24,512 --> 01:26:25,024
Who have

1661
01:26:25,280 --> 01:26:27,840
The writing staff put together

1662
01:26:28,096 --> 01:26:29,888
This well-worded

1663
01:26:31,424 --> 01:26:36,032
We we don't believe anything so everybody can believe whatever they want

1664
01:26:36,800 --> 01:26:37,824
He has to come out

1665
01:26:38,080 --> 01:26:40,128
And late are how much

1666
01:26:40,384 --> 01:26:43,968
Nothing he has about how the fact that he's a f****** Nazi

1667
01:26:44,224 --> 01:26:46,528
It's it's pretty fascinating on a lot of levels

1668
01:26:47,040 --> 01:26:49,088
Like this is exactly if you had

1669
01:26:49,344 --> 01:26:50,368
If you had Trump

1670
01:26:50,624 --> 01:26:52,928
Or Paul Ryan or Mitch McConnell

1671
01:26:53,184 --> 01:26:53,952
Just talk

1672
01:26:54,208 --> 01:27:00,352
Reveal exactly how awful and horrible and Races they are

1673
01:27:00,608 --> 01:27:01,376
The same white Nashua

1674
01:27:02,400 --> 01:27:08,544
Or they just reveal how little they give a s*** about any human being and all they want is f****** tax cuts for the rent

1675
01:27:08,800 --> 01:27:10,336
I think that if you had them just

1676
01:27:10,592 --> 01:27:13,664
Bitten nonsense for hours on end on a hot bike

1677
01:27:13,920 --> 01:27:16,224
One of the things we would reveal as they don't really know any

1678
01:27:16,736 --> 01:27:17,504
Now they don't like

1679
01:27:18,528 --> 01:27:19,808
Do more than like

1680
01:27:20,064 --> 01:27:20,576
I don't know.

1681
01:27:20,832 --> 01:27:26,976
10 minutes in a press conference without it being a bandhan Lee clear sayings

1682
01:27:27,232 --> 01:27:31,072
You really have a writing staff that's giving you good

1683
01:27:31,584 --> 01:27:32,864
You're just saying like

1684
01:27:33,120 --> 01:27:39,264
Look up not too long ago there was a lady who had a reporter who asked him what is that

1685
01:27:39,520 --> 01:27:45,664
Tomorrow

1686
01:27:48,992 --> 01:27:49,504
Yeah

1687
01:27:52,832 --> 01:27:53,600
Like before

1688
01:27:53,856 --> 01:27:54,880
Like during the bush

1689
01:27:55,136 --> 01:27:56,672
The gwu

1690
01:27:57,184 --> 01:28:01,280
We were at least a little bit confused as to where we were on the stupid verses

1691
01:28:01,792 --> 01:28:02,816
Stupid versus

1692
01:28:03,072 --> 01:28:04,352
Lizzie Velasquez

1693
01:28:04,608 --> 01:28:05,120
Now we're

1694
01:28:05,376 --> 01:28:07,168
Very clear that we are on the stupid

1695
01:28:07,424 --> 01:28:08,960
Woodside of evil

1696
01:28:09,216 --> 01:28:11,520
Like a

1697
01:28:11,776 --> 01:28:13,824
Cuz we're all the way up on stupid and

1698
01:28:14,080 --> 01:28:14,592
Evil at the sea

1699
01:28:15,104 --> 01:28:17,408
My weird corner

1700
01:28:17,664 --> 01:28:21,248
Sure so

1701
01:28:21,504 --> 01:28:22,016
Two clips

1702
01:28:22,272 --> 01:28:23,552
Contradicts himself

1703
01:28:23,808 --> 01:28:24,320
Which is delightful

1704
01:28:24,576 --> 01:28:26,112
Navigate to how you got it

1705
01:28:26,368 --> 01:28:27,648
Stay out of liberal cities

1706
01:28:28,160 --> 01:28:31,488
Any other thoughts about that

1707
01:28:32,256 --> 01:28:33,024
He gets into

1708
01:28:35,072 --> 01:28:36,096
He's already mentioned it

1709
01:28:36,352 --> 01:28:37,120
Boxes of Mac

1710
01:28:39,168 --> 01:28:40,960
That's true

1711
01:28:42,240 --> 01:28:48,384
Unfortunately I agree with Alex today this is what's going on on Fox

1712
01:28:48,640 --> 01:28:49,408
Now that I'm excited

1713
01:28:57,856 --> 01:29:01,696
Sure

1714
01:29:01,952 --> 01:29:02,464
Nope

1715
01:29:08,096 --> 01:29:14,240
Come out

1716
01:29:21,408 --> 01:29:22,176
Amazon TV

1717
01:29:22,432 --> 01:29:28,576
I want to mention it goes back to what even

1718
01:29:28,832 --> 01:29:29,344
About the car is

1719
01:29:29,600 --> 01:29:30,112
Is code for

1720
01:29:30,368 --> 01:29:33,696
Of course I didn't know about the dog

1721
01:29:33,952 --> 01:29:40,096
Megyn Kelly interview when you talkin about how he covered the Manchester bombing

1722
01:29:40,608 --> 01:29:42,912
Or you just got on here before he knew any of the facts

1723
01:29:43,168 --> 01:29:45,216
These were liberal

1724
01:29:45,472 --> 01:29:49,568
You forgot bombed

1725
01:29:49,824 --> 01:29:51,616
His f******

1726
01:29:52,128 --> 01:29:56,224
That isn't always just let the mouse go really fast

1727
01:29:58,784 --> 01:29:59,552
And they never do

1728
01:29:59,808 --> 01:30:02,880
And when they don't he just ignores the fact that he was wrong

1729
01:30:03,136 --> 01:30:04,672
And pretend like I was kind of right

1730
01:30:04,928 --> 01:30:05,696
It doesn't matter

1731
01:30:07,232 --> 01:30:08,000
God

1732
01:30:10,560 --> 01:30:12,608
I want words to have

1733
01:30:13,888 --> 01:30:14,400
Ben White

1734
01:30:17,984 --> 01:30:19,264
Everything about

1735
01:30:19,776 --> 01:30:21,824
I know nothing about those robber by Muslim

1736
01:30:24,128 --> 01:30:25,408
Caesars

1737
01:30:25,920 --> 01:30:28,480
Go in South Carolina shooting

1738
01:30:28,736 --> 01:30:34,880
Call Izzo whites are all guilty whites are all bad I know you are but what am I know you are but what am I

1739
01:30:35,136 --> 01:30:35,648
The white man

1740
01:30:46,656 --> 01:30:50,752
What are you talking about

1741
01:30:57,920 --> 01:31:04,064
What's the score

1742
01:31:04,320 --> 01:31:08,672
0

1743
01:31:12,256 --> 01:31:15,072
Controls

1744
01:31:15,328 --> 01:31:17,376
These are Global trying to push this.

1745
01:31:17,632 --> 01:31:23,776
So he takes the camera which it obviously is like an iPhone

1746
01:31:24,032 --> 01:31:26,592
Recording it attached

1747
01:31:27,872 --> 01:31:30,176
Buckley's had B Muffler

1748
01:31:30,432 --> 01:31:36,576
Please hadn't just drag them into the roads not Buckley Salazar

1749
01:31:37,344 --> 01:31:41,696
But they go into the other room where they have the TV the foxes playing on in the coffee room

1750
01:31:41,952 --> 01:31:43,488
I don't know if it's a

1751
01:31:43,744 --> 01:31:44,512
Pick up on this

1752
01:31:44,768 --> 01:31:45,792
From the audio

1753
01:31:46,048 --> 01:31:47,328
But most of the time

1754
01:31:47,584 --> 01:31:49,376
The video of it is on the TV

1755
01:31:49,632 --> 01:31:53,728
But you can hear cabinets opening and closing I think he wanted a snack

1756
01:31:55,520 --> 01:32:01,408
I think he's in the middle of a video and there's also a part where I found

1757
01:32:01,920 --> 01:32:03,456
Like you can hear him

1758
01:32:04,480 --> 01:32:05,760
To the camera person

1759
01:32:10,368 --> 01:32:14,720
It is incredibly lightning Pixies Whispering inaudible

1760
01:32:16,256 --> 01:32:22,400
But it's so weird

1761
01:32:22,656 --> 01:32:26,752
Opening and closing I got nothing

1762
01:32:27,008 --> 01:32:29,824
I'm going to go see what Fox News is doing see if I can get them a bit

1763
01:32:30,080 --> 01:32:35,456
All of this goes on for a long time

1764
01:32:35,968 --> 01:32:40,064
The audio was really terrible of the TV

1765
01:32:40,832 --> 01:32:41,856
Special Report

1766
01:32:42,112 --> 01:32:42,880
Especially

1767
01:32:43,392 --> 01:32:46,208
So the audio is really terrible at the Fox News people

1768
01:32:46,464 --> 01:32:48,256
Keep Coronavirus

1769
01:32:48,512 --> 01:32:50,304
It's worth the outside jumping in

1770
01:32:50,560 --> 01:32:53,888
This first one is about how everyone wants

1771
01:32:54,144 --> 01:32:54,656
Say the name

1772
01:32:54,912 --> 01:32:55,424
These groups

1773
01:32:55,936 --> 01:32:59,776
He wants that everyone expects him to be really specific in his condemnation

1774
01:33:00,288 --> 01:33:00,800
So here we go

1775
01:33:03,616 --> 01:33:06,432
It wasn't the alt right

1776
01:33:06,688 --> 01:33:12,832
You have to say radical Islamic radical Islamic terrorism

1777
01:33:18,976 --> 01:33:19,744
Great

1778
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:22,048
Turn tomato

1779
01:33:22,304 --> 01:33:26,912
Immediately

1780
01:33:29,472 --> 01:33:31,008
Yeah you got to stay the night

1781
01:33:31,264 --> 01:33:32,032
This is Toadette

1782
01:33:32,544 --> 01:33:33,056
Again

1783
01:33:33,312 --> 01:33:34,080
It's so weird

1784
01:33:34,336 --> 01:33:36,896
Revel in not giving a s*** about

1785
01:33:37,408 --> 01:33:38,688
You and I

1786
01:33:38,944 --> 01:33:39,968
Hair so much

1787
01:33:40,224 --> 01:33:42,272
About some sort of ideologically

1788
01:33:42,528 --> 01:33:44,064
Idly ideological

1789
01:33:47,904 --> 01:33:50,464
Against my will admit that you are right

1790
01:33:50,976 --> 01:33:55,840
About some conservative okay I will

1791
01:33:57,632 --> 01:33:58,912
Matters

1792
01:34:01,472 --> 01:34:04,800
How do you know if I were crazy

1793
01:34:05,056 --> 01:34:07,104
Battlefield how do you fight

1794
01:34:08,384 --> 01:34:10,176
I don't know but also

1795
01:34:13,248 --> 01:34:13,760
Mycallin

1796
01:34:14,272 --> 01:34:17,344
Yes I would say that what he's doing in the form of lesser Magic

1797
01:34:19,136 --> 01:34:24,768
Where he knows he's contradicting himself and being a complete hypocrite and he's doing it to rub it in your face

1798
01:34:25,280 --> 01:34:28,864
Because nothing's real and I can get away with anything

1799
01:34:29,120 --> 01:34:30,912
Sarah kendzior like

1800
01:34:31,424 --> 01:34:34,752
That's what fascist always want you to do is show you how little they can

1801
01:34:35,008 --> 01:34:39,104
Institutional version of game

1802
01:34:39,360 --> 01:34:41,408
I I care very much while you're asked

1803
01:34:41,664 --> 01:34:43,200
Can't believe that you don't care at all

1804
01:34:43,456 --> 01:34:44,480
That's out at Serta

1805
01:34:45,760 --> 01:34:47,040
But yeah so that's dumb

1806
01:34:47,296 --> 01:34:48,320
Alex

1807
01:34:48,576 --> 01:34:53,696
About the Southern Poverty Law Center

1808
01:35:03,168 --> 01:35:05,728
Southern Poverty Law Center

1809
01:35:05,984 --> 01:35:09,056
Southern Poverty Law Center has been caught running and Tire

1810
01:35:09,312 --> 01:35:12,640
Oklahoma City

1811
01:35:13,408 --> 01:35:16,480
Swastika

1812
01:35:21,600 --> 01:35:27,744
Racist white people but statistically

1813
01:35:28,768 --> 01:35:29,792
Bye-bye bye-bye bye-bye

1814
01:35:34,144 --> 01:35:37,984
Southern Poverty Law Center with running Elohim City

1815
01:35:38,240 --> 01:35:39,520
In the Timothy McVeigh was involved with

1816
01:35:39,776 --> 01:35:42,848
Before he ended up Longaberger

1817
01:35:43,104 --> 01:35:48,480
But just to re-up on that

1818
01:35:48,736 --> 01:35:50,272
Inside the

1819
01:35:52,832 --> 01:35:53,600
F****** with you

1820
01:35:55,136 --> 01:35:56,160
Supremacist organization

1821
01:35:57,696 --> 01:35:59,488
They was giving them information

1822
01:35:59,744 --> 01:36:00,512
And because it's important

1823
01:36:04,096 --> 01:36:04,864
In a lot of

1824
01:36:05,120 --> 01:36:06,400
White nationalism

1825
01:36:06,656 --> 01:36:07,936
Malicious for good reason

1826
01:36:10,240 --> 01:36:13,568
It's important

1827
01:36:13,824 --> 01:36:19,712
And they're not going to unlike Visa Dum Dums in the Vanguard America just going to post it on a website somewhere

1828
01:36:19,968 --> 01:36:20,992
Resurrection

1829
01:36:22,016 --> 01:36:22,528
Well

1830
01:36:24,576 --> 01:36:29,440
I mean sometimes it's a good thing and sometimes they use their plan to murder Fred Hampton

1831
01:36:29,696 --> 01:36:31,232
Celebrate

1832
01:36:32,512 --> 01:36:33,792
Believe

1833
01:36:34,048 --> 01:36:35,840
People because they are

1834
01:36:36,352 --> 01:36:37,376
Watching this s***

1835
01:36:37,632 --> 01:36:38,144
But it's

1836
01:36:39,168 --> 01:36:42,240
You would rather have them watching the knot watch

1837
01:36:42,752 --> 01:36:45,824
Complex

1838
01:36:46,080 --> 01:36:51,968
And ridiculous time believing that the Southern Poverty Law Center is involved

1839
01:36:52,480 --> 01:36:54,016
And I are planning bombings

1840
01:36:54,272 --> 01:36:54,784
Some stuff like that

1841
01:36:55,040 --> 01:36:56,320
Phone

1842
01:36:56,576 --> 01:36:57,088
About 1

1843
01:36:57,344 --> 01:37:03,488
Whatever important pieces

1844
01:37:05,024 --> 01:37:07,072
World is the southern

1845
01:37:07,328 --> 01:37:08,608
Call center

1846
01:37:08,864 --> 01:37:11,424
Eskipoo

1847
01:37:11,680 --> 01:37:12,704
That shitt

1848
01:37:12,960 --> 01:37:16,288
Plus

1849
01:37:16,544 --> 01:37:18,592
Plants inside of

1850
01:37:18,848 --> 01:37:19,360
Isis

1851
01:37:19,616 --> 01:37:20,640
Making sure that they

1852
01:37:20,896 --> 01:37:21,408
Wait a second

1853
01:37:23,968 --> 01:37:25,248
Have you been listening to Infowars

1854
01:37:25,504 --> 01:37:26,272
I'm telling you

1855
01:37:26,528 --> 01:37:29,088
I know that sounds very similar

1856
01:37:29,600 --> 01:37:31,392
Fighting a lot of free speech issues

1857
01:37:32,160 --> 01:37:33,184
You know how that's going

1858
01:37:33,440 --> 01:37:36,000
People for like

1859
01:37:37,536 --> 01:37:39,072
First Amendment

1860
01:37:40,608 --> 01:37:42,400
This is always the first people with a briefcase

1861
01:37:42,656 --> 01:37:43,680
Hemet Court

1862
01:37:43,936 --> 01:37:46,240
Whenever whenever there is that Muslim ban

1863
01:37:46,496 --> 01:37:48,544
Isis being there

1864
01:37:49,056 --> 01:37:54,432
Looking up the statutes that keep that from going off

1865
01:37:54,688 --> 01:37:55,968
Everybody knows this

1866
01:37:56,224 --> 01:38:00,320
I wanted to pull out

1867
01:38:00,576 --> 01:38:06,720
I think really important is all these evil whites when in reality white people are

1868
01:38:06,976 --> 01:38:07,744
Likely to commit

1869
01:38:09,024 --> 01:38:10,560
12 * right is well.

1870
01:38:17,216 --> 01:38:19,264
Referent in a real statistic

1871
01:38:19,520 --> 01:38:20,544
He doesn't understand that

1872
01:38:20,800 --> 01:38:26,432
They're reporting issues and

1873
01:38:26,688 --> 01:38:29,248
Crimes against white people

1874
01:38:29,760 --> 01:38:30,528
Swept under the rug

1875
01:38:30,784 --> 01:38:31,808
And I know from my own

1876
01:38:32,064 --> 01:38:32,576
Personal life

1877
01:38:32,832 --> 01:38:35,648
There's so many times that if I was black I would have been arrested

1878
01:38:35,904 --> 01:38:36,416
Dead as a child

1879
01:38:36,672 --> 01:38:40,768
Breaking into places or buildings in

1880
01:38:41,024 --> 01:38:42,304
Alex knows that

1881
01:38:42,560 --> 01:38:47,168
Alex has pointed out that the reason he hasn't been arrested

1882
01:38:47,424 --> 01:38:50,240
It's because of a white nationalist

1883
01:38:50,496 --> 01:38:52,032
The cop that pulled over

1884
01:38:55,616 --> 01:38:56,640
Bring it up

1885
01:38:57,152 --> 01:38:58,176
Cuz if you had any

1886
01:38:58,432 --> 01:39:00,992
If you had any inkling of intelligence

1887
01:39:01,504 --> 01:39:02,272
You just let that one

1888
01:39:02,528 --> 01:39:05,600
Well he knows his audience doesn't

1889
01:39:05,856 --> 01:39:07,648
Inclined to pity white people

1890
01:39:09,952 --> 01:39:11,488
It doesn't matter if he's already

1891
01:39:11,744 --> 01:39:14,560
Negated his own point on his own show that

1892
01:39:14,816 --> 01:39:15,840
Still available

1893
01:39:16,096 --> 01:39:16,864
Don't matter

1894
01:39:20,448 --> 01:39:22,240
Can we burn in as a warlock

1895
01:39:23,008 --> 01:39:28,384
Against anybody considered this whether or not Superman

1896
01:39:28,640 --> 01:39:34,784
I would love it if it wasn't himself emulated what your sister to protest

1897
01:39:35,040 --> 01:39:38,624
Emily flick the cigarette

1898
01:39:38,880 --> 01:39:39,904
Goes Up in Flames

1899
01:39:40,160 --> 01:39:42,208
Justice weddings for male infertility

1900
01:39:42,464 --> 01:39:44,000
I'm so this next clip

1901
01:39:44,256 --> 01:39:45,536
Explains

1902
01:39:46,816 --> 01:39:47,328
Thank you psychic

1903
01:39:47,584 --> 01:39:48,096
But

1904
01:39:57,056 --> 01:39:57,568
Please nuts

1905
01:39:57,824 --> 01:39:58,592
And also

1906
01:39:58,848 --> 01:40:00,128
Strikes me as like

1907
01:40:00,896 --> 01:40:02,688
People ask me this that's

1908
01:40:02,944 --> 01:40:04,736
Such a f****** b******* thing I've ever listened

1909
01:40:04,992 --> 01:40:07,552
The Paul Stanley's album

1910
01:40:08,064 --> 01:40:11,136
The lead singer of Kiss about this album

1911
01:40:11,392 --> 01:40:12,416
I'm in the past

1912
01:40:12,672 --> 01:40:13,696
Course I haven't

1913
01:40:13,952 --> 01:40:18,304
He constantly starts things like people come up to be

1914
01:40:18,816 --> 01:40:20,352
Stuff like that

1915
01:40:20,608 --> 01:40:23,680
He does all this like he just needs an excuse to say what he wants

1916
01:40:23,936 --> 01:40:28,032
Give me to a story by pretending people always come up to him and ask

1917
01:40:29,568 --> 01:40:35,712
Called you a big dick and I say yes I do if that levels up

1918
01:40:35,968 --> 01:40:38,784
When I see that rhetorical trick being used by Alex

1919
01:40:42,368 --> 01:40:43,392
You dumbass hole

1920
01:40:44,160 --> 01:40:45,696
Anyway I just think that's delightful

1921
01:40:46,464 --> 01:40:47,232
I like that that

1922
01:40:47,488 --> 01:40:49,536
That's a little fun mixed in with

1923
01:40:49,792 --> 01:40:50,304
Does nonsense

1924
01:40:53,120 --> 01:40:54,144
Quit

1925
01:40:54,912 --> 01:40:56,448
It's more just about the

1926
01:40:56,704 --> 01:40:57,472
The car murder

1927
01:40:57,728 --> 01:40:58,752
He wants to

1928
01:40:59,008 --> 01:40:59,776
Spinach be like

1929
01:41:02,848 --> 01:41:04,896
Did you did you read that he's only been charged

1930
01:41:06,688 --> 01:41:07,200
Yeah

1931
01:41:07,968 --> 01:41:09,248
And a bunch of other charges

1932
01:41:09,504 --> 01:41:10,016
But not right

1933
01:41:10,272 --> 01:41:11,296
Avery murder

1934
01:41:13,088 --> 01:41:13,856
Tourism

1935
01:41:14,624 --> 01:41:16,928
Terrorism like this is

1936
01:41:17,696 --> 01:41:18,464
There's no

1937
01:41:18,976 --> 01:41:24,096
Well then terrorism task force is only about Islam

1938
01:41:25,120 --> 01:41:26,912
So great this is one of those things

1939
01:41:28,192 --> 01:41:28,704
Like

1940
01:41:29,728 --> 01:41:30,496
As as

1941
01:41:31,264 --> 01:41:33,056
Disgusted with America's I am

1942
01:41:37,408 --> 01:41:38,688
For the first degree

1943
01:41:39,200 --> 01:41:42,528
Well to the charges in order to make sure you actually get it

1944
01:41:42,784 --> 01:41:43,808
Conviction

1945
01:41:44,064 --> 01:41:45,344
That possible

1946
01:41:45,600 --> 01:41:46,624
That's sad.

1947
01:41:46,880 --> 01:41:47,392
Disgusted

1948
01:41:48,928 --> 01:41:50,208
Softener

1949
01:41:51,488 --> 01:41:53,792
Here's more disgusting

1950
01:42:03,008 --> 01:42:04,288
You showed

1951
01:42:04,800 --> 01:42:06,336
A journalist being murdered

1952
01:42:07,360 --> 01:42:07,872
Lied

1953
01:42:08,640 --> 01:42:09,920
F****** s***

1954
01:42:17,088 --> 01:42:19,648
It's a one of the things that he's doing here

1955
01:42:20,928 --> 01:42:21,440
Yeah

1956
01:42:23,744 --> 01:42:29,888
But also get rid of the conversation is going on in Fox News that he was

1957
01:42:30,144 --> 01:42:33,984
Is incredibly scary

1958
01:42:34,496 --> 01:42:35,776
Right because

1959
01:42:36,032 --> 01:42:36,800
Well

1960
01:42:37,056 --> 01:42:40,128
I have some laws for you multiples

1961
01:42:40,384 --> 01:42:42,432
About how you should be allowed

1962
01:42:44,224 --> 01:42:49,856
With your f****** car because they're blocking

1963
01:42:50,112 --> 01:42:53,696
It's not a crime commercial terrorism protesting

1964
01:42:53,952 --> 01:42:58,816
Commercial terrorism cuz they're not letting you make your deliveries are getting to your job or whatever

1965
01:42:59,072 --> 01:43:02,400
First Amendment rights allow me to

1966
01:43:02,656 --> 01:43:03,936
They're being disruptive

1967
01:43:04,192 --> 01:43:10,336
What year is it

1968
01:43:10,592 --> 01:43:11,616
He knows that the audio is

1969
01:43:11,872 --> 01:43:14,944
Go to the Fox News stuff so

1970
01:43:15,456 --> 01:43:17,248
He's responding

1971
01:43:17,504 --> 01:43:21,600
Something on the Fox News

1972
01:43:21,856 --> 01:43:23,136
It's the same thing he does whenever he

1973
01:43:23,648 --> 01:43:24,416
Pretend to listen

1974
01:43:26,208 --> 01:43:26,976
Stopped

1975
01:43:27,232 --> 01:43:33,376
The tub right here I need to get it go back 10 seconds

1976
01:43:33,888 --> 01:43:36,960
He's so fattening so ugly look at his f****** face Maddie doesn't

1977
01:43:37,216 --> 01:43:40,032
Mr. creeps

1978
01:43:42,336 --> 01:43:43,360
Alex

1979
01:43:44,384 --> 01:43:47,456
He believes that the I'm letting us run through

1980
01:43:47,712 --> 01:43:52,576
Eclipse now.it we got an hour 45 Vero

1981
01:43:53,088 --> 01:43:58,208
Alex

1982
01:43:58,464 --> 01:43:58,976
Cuz really going

1983
01:44:04,864 --> 01:44:06,144
What's

1984
01:44:23,296 --> 01:44:26,624
Continue

1985
01:44:30,208 --> 01:44:34,304
And go out in public

1986
01:44:42,240 --> 01:44:45,056
Live protest

1987
01:44:45,568 --> 01:44:47,872
What they were

1988
01:44:48,640 --> 01:44:54,784
What they were discussing in the Fox News before he got on his I told you and then tried to do a Ric Flair impression

1989
01:44:56,064 --> 01:44:57,088
What is

1990
01:44:59,136 --> 01:45:01,696
It becomes an interesting line we're protesting

1991
01:45:04,512 --> 01:45:05,024
Start

1992
01:45:05,536 --> 01:45:08,352
I am that is a conversation we're going to need to have sooner than later

1993
01:45:08,864 --> 01:45:09,632
Because it's going to

1994
01:45:09,888 --> 01:45:10,656
Keep happening

1995
01:45:10,912 --> 01:45:11,424
The problem

1996
01:45:11,936 --> 01:45:15,264
Fun waffles

1997
01:45:15,520 --> 01:45:21,664
You can't you can't bring people together if you essentially are trying to start a riot

1998
01:45:21,920 --> 01:45:24,224
Expectation that you know you're going to start a riot

1999
01:45:24,480 --> 01:45:26,016
Not okay

2000
01:45:26,272 --> 01:45:27,040
I know

2001
01:45:27,296 --> 01:45:29,600
I don't know how to

2002
01:45:30,112 --> 01:45:30,880
I don't know how to engage

2003
01:45:31,392 --> 01:45:32,928
I don't either because

2004
01:45:33,184 --> 01:45:34,208
Cuz that's been used

2005
01:45:36,768 --> 01:45:37,280
Oppressively

2006
01:45:37,536 --> 01:45:39,072
Like that is

2007
01:45:39,328 --> 01:45:39,840
That is

2008
01:45:41,888 --> 01:45:44,192
How many times have you seen right

2009
01:45:45,984 --> 01:45:47,520
Take down somebody on arm

2010
01:45:48,544 --> 01:45:49,568
Not doing anything

2011
01:45:50,080 --> 01:45:52,384
Literally literally

2012
01:45:52,896 --> 01:45:55,456
You look at the way that the police

2013
01:45:55,712 --> 01:45:56,224
Treated this

2014
01:45:58,784 --> 01:46:00,576
Not much

2015
01:46:00,832 --> 01:46:02,880
S*** but that's that's why I'm coming to

2016
01:46:03,392 --> 01:46:04,416
The point that I am

2017
01:46:05,952 --> 01:46:07,744
There is a line

2018
01:46:09,792 --> 01:46:10,304
More

2019
01:46:10,560 --> 01:46:13,376
Adult reasonable conversation about like what is protest

2020
01:46:13,632 --> 01:46:15,680
Testing what is demonstrating a

2021
01:46:17,216 --> 01:46:18,752
I think it would serve everyone

2022
01:46:19,008 --> 01:46:19,520
Purposes

2023
01:46:19,776 --> 01:46:25,920
But because I was dumb conversation

2024
01:46:27,456 --> 01:46:27,968
Peabody

2025
01:46:28,224 --> 01:46:28,992
Essentially was

2026
01:46:29,248 --> 01:46:29,760
What's going on

2027
01:46:30,016 --> 01:46:32,064
He pretends I got you

2028
01:46:32,320 --> 01:46:37,184
What you doing this you want to ban protest you want to say the conservatives can't have any kind of protest

2029
01:46:37,696 --> 01:46:38,464
That's not true

2030
01:46:38,976 --> 01:46:40,256
Conservatives have the protest

2031
01:46:40,512 --> 01:46:43,584
If they want to have

2032
01:46:43,840 --> 01:46:46,144
Or maybe I'm even okay with that uncertain Circle

2033
01:46:46,400 --> 01:46:47,168
Dances

2034
01:46:47,424 --> 01:46:48,704
Yeah I think it's okay

2035
01:46:51,520 --> 01:46:53,312
This is where this is where were

2036
01:46:54,080 --> 01:46:56,896
Did the radiological right now

2037
01:46:57,664 --> 01:46:58,432
That is true

2038
01:46:58,944 --> 01:47:00,992
Know what you're looking at me like you do

2039
01:47:02,016 --> 01:47:02,528
Don't like that

2040
01:47:03,040 --> 01:47:06,624
But I'm no longer in the

2041
01:47:06,880 --> 01:47:08,416
In the I do want to take our guns

2042
01:47:08,672 --> 01:47:11,488
Open Karen

2043
01:47:13,536 --> 01:47:17,632
Yes responsible gun ownership is something that does exist in

2044
01:47:17,888 --> 01:47:21,216
In the country

2045
01:47:21,472 --> 01:47:23,776
Population

2046
01:47:24,544 --> 01:47:25,824
I don't like

2047
01:47:26,080 --> 01:47:28,384
Then there being large militias at

2048
01:47:28,640 --> 01:47:29,664
Protests like this

2049
01:47:30,176 --> 01:47:30,688
I think the

2050
01:47:35,808 --> 01:47:37,344
Elementary

2051
01:47:37,856 --> 01:47:38,880
But in terms of

2052
01:47:39,392 --> 01:47:39,904
You know

2053
01:47:40,160 --> 01:47:41,696
Expressing your political beliefs

2054
01:47:41,952 --> 01:47:43,488
So you should be able to have gun

2055
01:47:44,000 --> 01:47:45,536
I think that's reasonable I don't take

2056
01:47:47,072 --> 01:47:50,400
The only reason that it seems unreasonable because the world we live in right now

2057
01:47:51,936 --> 01:47:57,568
Okay okay I'm sorry I don't know I don't mean to cut you off

2058
01:47:58,080 --> 01:47:58,592
You know I love you

2059
01:48:02,688 --> 01:48:03,968
I don't understand

2060
01:48:04,480 --> 01:48:04,992
How you can

2061
01:48:05,504 --> 01:48:06,016
Bringing

2062
01:48:06,528 --> 01:48:07,040
An

2063
01:48:08,576 --> 01:48:09,344
To a protest

2064
01:48:09,600 --> 01:48:10,112
Is not

2065
01:48:10,880 --> 01:48:11,392
Itself a form

2066
01:48:12,672 --> 01:48:16,256
That's why I'm trying to make this line that I don't like it

2067
01:48:16,512 --> 01:48:17,024
Here

2068
01:48:17,280 --> 01:48:19,072
But in protest that are

2069
01:48:19,328 --> 01:48:19,840
Second Amendment

2070
01:48:20,096 --> 01:48:21,632
Bass stuff like that it is

2071
01:48:21,888 --> 01:48:24,192
Reasonable it's within the law and people

2072
01:48:24,448 --> 01:48:26,752
If people are handling themselves responsibly

2073
01:48:27,776 --> 01:48:29,056
But if you

2074
01:48:29,312 --> 01:48:33,408
Somebody or something like that then that in and of itself is a crime

2075
01:48:34,944 --> 01:48:35,712
Protests aspect

2076
01:48:37,248 --> 01:48:38,272
How do you take

2077
01:48:38,528 --> 01:48:39,040
Make an AR-15

2078
01:48:40,320 --> 01:48:42,112
And not eventually wind up

2079
01:48:43,136 --> 01:48:45,696
I think that it happens a lot

2080
01:48:45,952 --> 01:48:47,744
Turning around

2081
01:48:48,512 --> 01:48:50,816
Responsible gun owners always

2082
01:48:51,328 --> 01:48:52,096
You're gone at the ground

2083
01:48:52,352 --> 01:48:53,888
You always

2084
01:48:54,144 --> 01:48:55,168
It's not loaded

2085
01:48:55,424 --> 01:48:56,960
Those sorts of things

2086
01:48:57,216 --> 01:49:03,360
If if people are tell me those guys I don't have to unload

2087
01:49:04,128 --> 01:49:04,896
So it's not fair

2088
01:49:05,152 --> 01:49:05,664
You're right

2089
01:49:05,920 --> 01:49:07,456
You're right

2090
01:49:07,712 --> 01:49:10,272
You're right that I don't know

2091
01:49:13,088 --> 01:49:15,648
What what what I'm saying is

2092
01:49:15,904 --> 01:49:18,976
I would not like to see

2093
01:49:19,232 --> 01:49:20,512
Are things that are illegal

2094
01:49:21,024 --> 01:49:24,608
And if people are doing well they have a gun at a protest

2095
01:49:24,864 --> 01:49:25,888
I think they should be arrested

2096
01:49:26,400 --> 01:49:27,424
But if you follow the

2097
01:49:27,936 --> 01:49:29,216
Safety protocols

2098
01:49:29,472 --> 01:49:30,240
Stuff like that

2099
01:49:30,496 --> 01:49:33,056
I don't really think it's it's really that bad

2100
01:49:33,824 --> 01:49:36,128
I don't I think it is allowed

2101
01:49:36,384 --> 01:49:39,456
Restatement silly part where it is

2102
01:49:40,224 --> 01:49:40,992
Don't think it's a problem

2103
01:49:42,528 --> 01:49:46,368
I do believe that we have our

2104
01:49:46,624 --> 01:49:47,136
Exactly

2105
01:49:49,696 --> 01:49:50,208
Stance

2106
01:49:50,720 --> 01:49:51,744
All

2107
01:49:52,000 --> 01:49:54,304
All reality

2108
01:49:55,072 --> 01:49:58,912
Consider this as an intellectual

2109
01:50:00,704 --> 01:50:02,496
You have a very cogent

2110
01:50:02,752 --> 01:50:03,264
And

2111
01:50:03,520 --> 01:50:04,032
Accurate

2112
01:50:04,288 --> 01:50:05,312
Point I agree with

2113
01:50:06,336 --> 01:50:06,848
We don't live in

2114
01:50:09,664 --> 01:50:11,456
We don't live there

2115
01:50:11,712 --> 01:50:13,760
Let me flip your laundry

2116
01:50:14,016 --> 01:50:16,320
Native American

2117
01:50:16,576 --> 01:50:18,112
Holding a bottle of water

2118
01:50:18,368 --> 01:50:19,136
That is more

2119
01:50:19,392 --> 01:50:20,416
Threatening

2120
01:50:20,672 --> 01:50:26,816
Then a white dude that's a massive problem

2121
01:50:27,072 --> 01:50:30,656
Is not of holding a gun at a protest

2122
01:50:30,912 --> 01:50:32,448
Is an insect

2123
01:50:32,704 --> 01:50:36,544
It may be it maybe in your mind but let me flip that

2124
01:50:36,800 --> 01:50:38,336
A tiny bit

2125
01:50:39,616 --> 01:50:41,920
I don't know giving way too much.

2126
01:50:44,480 --> 01:50:47,040
If you say that just the very presence

2127
01:50:47,296 --> 01:50:49,856
David Gunn is an incitement when the person

2128
01:50:50,112 --> 01:50:51,648
There were hypothetically talking about

2129
01:50:51,904 --> 01:50:52,416
Is

2130
01:50:52,672 --> 01:50:56,512
Carrying it responsibly it's pointed at the grounds are not threatening anybody

2131
01:50:57,024 --> 01:50:58,816
It's your saying it's still inside

2132
01:50:59,328 --> 01:51:03,680
I would say there are people who believe it's being two men kissing in public

2133
01:51:03,936 --> 01:51:04,704
Isn't in sight

2134
01:51:05,216 --> 01:51:07,520
It's something that they are very offended by

2135
01:51:07,776 --> 01:51:09,312
And the rubbing it in your face

2136
01:51:09,568 --> 01:51:13,920
In in the pride parades people running around with their songs on with their dicks showing

2137
01:51:14,176 --> 01:51:17,760
That's an incitement hold on

2138
01:51:18,016 --> 01:51:20,576
People who are protesting by blocking traffic

2139
01:51:20,832 --> 01:51:21,856
That's an insult

2140
01:51:23,648 --> 01:51:26,720
And that makes me very proud

2141
01:51:26,976 --> 01:51:33,120
Flexing some sort of muscle you don't have I'm not saying I agree with that but that same logic could be used for

2142
01:51:33,376 --> 01:51:37,216
And that's a dangerous path to go down

2143
01:51:38,752 --> 01:51:41,056
Has two men kissing ever gone wrong

2144
01:51:41,312 --> 01:51:42,080
And killed somebody

2145
01:51:43,104 --> 01:51:46,688
Imagine

2146
01:51:46,944 --> 01:51:47,968
Misfired

2147
01:51:48,224 --> 01:51:48,992
And kill the child

2148
01:51:49,248 --> 01:51:53,088
That dude in the street ever

2149
01:51:53,344 --> 01:51:57,440
Accidentally overturn and killed somebody had somebody in the street ever

2150
01:51:59,488 --> 01:52:00,256
Hit a woman

2151
01:52:00,512 --> 01:52:03,328
And then backed up and then hit 10 more people

2152
01:52:03,584 --> 01:52:04,352
But that's

2153
01:52:06,144 --> 01:52:09,984
Your argument

2154
01:52:10,240 --> 01:52:14,592
Understand where you're coming from but within my own argument that's taken care of

2155
01:52:16,128 --> 01:52:16,640
Because

2156
01:52:17,920 --> 01:52:18,944
Big guns

2157
01:52:19,456 --> 01:52:20,224
Be unloaded

2158
01:52:20,480 --> 01:52:23,040
So if there's a misfire they're already doing something wrong

2159
01:52:23,808 --> 01:52:25,088
So that part of it

2160
01:52:25,600 --> 01:52:26,368
Is kind of like

2161
01:52:26,880 --> 01:52:32,000
All right within the within the parameters that I'm setting for what I think is

2162
01:52:32,256 --> 01:52:35,072
Acceptable

2163
01:52:35,328 --> 01:52:35,840
If you want to take

2164
01:52:37,632 --> 01:52:38,144
That's right you have

2165
01:52:39,680 --> 01:52:41,216
Make it clear that it is unloaded

2166
01:52:42,240 --> 01:52:42,752
That

2167
01:52:43,008 --> 01:52:43,520
To be done

2168
01:52:44,032 --> 01:52:47,872
I don't I don't see a problem with that having some sort of

2169
01:52:48,128 --> 01:52:49,152
Station where they check

2170
01:52:49,408 --> 01:52:52,480
Exotic erasable

2171
01:52:53,248 --> 01:52:53,760
Did this happen

2172
01:52:54,272 --> 01:52:57,344
I don't know I but I don't know I don't I don't know nearly enough

2173
01:52:57,856 --> 01:53:03,488
You know I know that things weren't checked I believe that that they didn't check each and every one of those

2174
01:53:03,744 --> 01:53:08,608
No probably not

2175
01:53:08,864 --> 01:53:15,008
There is

2176
01:53:16,288 --> 01:53:17,056
In this

2177
01:53:17,568 --> 01:53:18,592
Then we have two steps

2178
01:53:18,848 --> 01:53:19,616
Further parameters

2179
01:53:20,128 --> 01:53:21,152
So that a gun

2180
01:53:21,920 --> 01:53:22,688
But even then

2181
01:53:23,200 --> 01:53:26,784
You can hit somebody with the butt of a gun you can you can't

2182
01:53:27,040 --> 01:53:28,576
Hit somebody with two guys kissing

2183
01:53:29,088 --> 01:53:33,952
No but if you have a sign that says I'm super into two guys kissing you could hit somebody with the staff of that

2184
01:53:34,208 --> 01:53:36,000
Fair

2185
01:53:36,256 --> 01:53:36,768
The fair argue

2186
01:53:38,304 --> 01:53:44,448
Disagreeing with you on that do only thing I'm just the only reason I brought those examples

2187
01:53:44,704 --> 01:53:45,984
Listen to it was because you were

2188
01:53:46,240 --> 01:53:48,288
Hindering your argument on the idea of insight

2189
01:53:48,800 --> 01:53:51,360
And just because you have a natural reaction

2190
01:53:51,616 --> 01:53:52,640
Come from

2191
01:53:52,896 --> 01:53:55,712
Which I believe obviously is probably more reasonable

2192
01:53:55,968 --> 01:53:58,016
Then being incited by seeing two dudes kiss

2193
01:53:58,272 --> 01:53:59,296
It is

2194
01:53:59,552 --> 01:54:00,064
The same

2195
01:54:00,320 --> 01:54:02,880
Sort of reaction that you're having within your brain

2196
01:54:03,392 --> 01:54:04,160
Now yours

2197
01:54:04,416 --> 01:54:05,696
Your reaction is more

2198
01:54:05,952 --> 01:54:06,720
Threat Bass

2199
01:54:07,232 --> 01:54:08,256
Like this is a threat

2200
01:54:10,560 --> 01:54:13,632
But they would think that seeing these two dudes kissing

2201
01:54:14,144 --> 01:54:18,752
Inasmuch as they believe that there's a gay agenda and what-have-you they the same

2202
01:54:19,264 --> 01:54:19,776
Sort of

2203
01:54:20,288 --> 01:54:21,568
Dumb

2204
01:54:21,824 --> 01:54:22,592
But there is a dump

2205
01:54:22,848 --> 01:54:24,128
A response the people have

2206
01:54:24,640 --> 01:54:25,920
And I know that I'm

2207
01:54:26,176 --> 01:54:27,968
Being

2208
01:54:29,760 --> 01:54:31,296
I don't think it's fair

2209
01:54:31,808 --> 01:54:35,648
To paint all gun owners defending

2210
01:54:35,904 --> 01:54:37,184
Reasonable conservative

2211
01:54:37,440 --> 01:54:39,488
There are a lot of reasonable gun owners

2212
01:54:39,744 --> 01:54:41,024
You are not and I don't

2213
01:54:41,280 --> 01:54:42,048
Disagree with you on this boy

2214
01:54:42,816 --> 01:54:43,328
My point is

2215
01:54:43,840 --> 01:54:44,352
If you are taking

2216
01:54:44,608 --> 01:54:45,120
10 guns 2

2217
01:54:45,888 --> 01:54:46,400
And I'll Stand

2218
01:54:47,424 --> 01:54:47,936
Peaceful protest

2219
01:54:48,704 --> 01:54:49,728
That is

2220
01:54:49,984 --> 01:54:51,520
What else what else is a gun

2221
01:54:51,776 --> 01:54:52,288
4

2222
01:54:52,544 --> 01:54:53,056
Hunting

2223
01:54:53,568 --> 01:54:54,336
Yeah okay

2224
01:54:54,592 --> 01:54:56,128
So take a peaceful protest

2225
01:54:56,896 --> 01:54:57,664
What are you hunting

2226
01:54:57,920 --> 01:54:58,688
Baby squirrels

2227
01:54:58,944 --> 01:55:05,088
Monkey squirrels

2228
01:55:06,112 --> 01:55:11,232
You are too because the beginning

2229
01:55:11,488 --> 01:55:14,560
Prompted out of nowhere is that

2230
01:55:15,328 --> 01:55:15,840
Idle

2231
01:55:17,632 --> 01:55:19,936
I don't think it is great to see

2232
01:55:20,192 --> 01:55:21,984
These guns in the militias

2233
01:55:22,240 --> 01:55:23,264
This sort of protein

2234
01:55:23,776 --> 01:55:25,056
Yes but in the context

2235
01:55:25,312 --> 01:55:26,848
Second Amendment

2236
01:55:27,104 --> 01:55:28,640
Gun oriented protest

2237
01:55:28,896 --> 01:55:29,664
I totally

2238
01:55:29,920 --> 01:55:30,432
Understand it

2239
01:55:30,944 --> 01:55:32,224
Cast

2240
01:55:32,480 --> 01:55:33,504
Have a peaceful

2241
01:55:33,760 --> 01:55:35,552
Gun oriented protest

2242
01:55:35,808 --> 01:55:37,344
Where it is reasonable and

2243
01:55:37,600 --> 01:55:38,368
Totally

2244
01:55:38,880 --> 01:55:39,904
Responsible to

2245
01:55:40,160 --> 01:55:40,928
To have guns

2246
01:55:41,184 --> 01:55:42,208
When you inject guns

2247
01:55:42,464 --> 01:55:44,256
In places they don't belong

2248
01:55:44,512 --> 01:55:47,328
That brings me muddies the water a little bit

2249
01:55:47,840 --> 01:55:48,864
I'm not defending

2250
01:55:49,120 --> 01:55:50,656
Armed militias with

2251
01:55:50,912 --> 01:55:53,216
Semi-automatic weapon showing up

2252
01:55:53,472 --> 01:55:56,544
But counter-protest liberal protest

2253
01:55:57,056 --> 01:55:59,360
I think that it's helped kind of us

2254
01:55:59,872 --> 01:56:01,408
Okay but I died

2255
01:56:02,176 --> 01:56:04,224
I don't think the absolute presence of a gun

2256
01:56:05,760 --> 01:56:06,272
Contact

2257
01:56:06,528 --> 01:56:08,064
In responsible ownership

2258
01:56:08,320 --> 01:56:09,600
Is something

2259
01:56:09,856 --> 01:56:11,136
Okay that's all the point

2260
01:56:13,184 --> 01:56:13,696
And I

2261
01:56:13,952 --> 01:56:14,464
I get

2262
01:56:14,720 --> 01:56:15,232
I get your point

2263
01:56:16,256 --> 01:56:17,280
And I do

2264
01:56:19,584 --> 01:56:21,888
But but then you come at me with like

2265
01:56:22,400 --> 01:56:24,448
Well a response what's a gun for

2266
01:56:24,960 --> 01:56:25,472
For hunting

2267
01:56:25,728 --> 01:56:26,496
Event

2268
01:56:26,752 --> 01:56:30,080
Or or or Leisure what's an Recreation

2269
01:56:30,336 --> 01:56:30,848
AR-15

2270
01:56:31,872 --> 01:56:34,176
The argument and I'm not

2271
01:56:34,432 --> 01:56:35,456
I'm certainly not making this argue

2272
01:56:35,712 --> 01:56:36,480
You're mad but I know that

2273
01:56:36,736 --> 01:56:38,272
I have some say in French

2274
01:56:38,784 --> 01:56:40,832
Who have large rifles

2275
01:56:41,088 --> 01:56:42,880
Stuff like that that are beyond what you need someone

2276
01:56:43,136 --> 01:56:43,904
A semiotic

2277
01:56:44,160 --> 01:56:46,464
If you have if you brought a semi-automatic

2278
01:56:47,488 --> 01:56:48,000
Into this room

2279
01:56:48,256 --> 01:56:49,024
Wow

2280
01:56:49,280 --> 01:56:50,304
While we are recording

2281
01:56:50,816 --> 01:56:51,328
This

2282
01:56:56,960 --> 01:56:58,496
We do have a lot of variables

2283
01:56:58,752 --> 01:57:00,544
Protest

2284
01:57:01,568 --> 01:57:02,336
Situation where

2285
01:57:02,848 --> 01:57:03,872
An AR-15

2286
01:57:04,384 --> 01:57:05,408
Which is what

2287
01:57:05,664 --> 01:57:06,432
They

2288
01:57:06,688 --> 01:57:07,200
A f******

2289
01:57:07,456 --> 01:57:08,224
They were wearing

2290
01:57:08,736 --> 01:57:11,296
Body armor

2291
01:57:11,552 --> 01:57:12,320
The real world

2292
01:57:12,576 --> 01:57:13,856
And you're taking this into the App Store

2293
01:57:14,368 --> 01:57:14,880
And I

2294
01:57:15,136 --> 01:57:15,648
I totally

2295
01:57:15,904 --> 01:57:16,672
Agree with you

2296
01:57:16,928 --> 01:57:18,464
In a vacuum and

2297
01:57:18,720 --> 01:57:19,232
We don't live

2298
01:57:19,744 --> 01:57:23,840
No vacuum

2299
01:57:25,376 --> 01:57:26,656
If we have regulations

2300
01:57:28,960 --> 01:57:29,984
Which is what we do

2301
01:57:30,240 --> 01:57:34,080
Work permits and stuff like that

2302
01:57:34,336 --> 01:57:36,128
Guns you can bring those

2303
01:57:36,384 --> 01:57:36,896
Speed zone

2304
01:57:37,152 --> 01:57:37,920
They're not

2305
01:57:38,176 --> 01:57:39,456
They're inciting violence

2306
01:57:39,968 --> 01:57:45,856
No no because because those people took those people in order to be carrying guns in public would have to have a permit

2307
01:57:46,368 --> 01:57:49,184
Right every single

2308
01:57:50,464 --> 01:57:54,048
I'm doing alright they did

2309
01:57:54,816 --> 01:57:55,328
You do

2310
01:57:56,096 --> 01:57:57,120
But I don't

2311
01:57:57,376 --> 01:57:58,656
Great

2312
01:57:59,168 --> 01:58:03,776
I mean I guess I guess we're not going to work we're coming down

2313
01:58:04,032 --> 01:58:06,080
To both of us not having the right information

2314
01:58:06,336 --> 01:58:06,848
You're right

2315
01:58:07,104 --> 01:58:12,480
So we can't we can't really litigate what was going on at this Pacific protest

2316
01:58:12,736 --> 01:58:15,552
You are absolutely right and I want to get off this

2317
01:58:16,576 --> 01:58:17,344
Ever

2318
01:58:20,672 --> 01:58:21,440
Big

2319
01:58:21,696 --> 01:58:23,744
People having like these high-powered rifles

2320
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:25,024
Semi-automatic weapon

2321
01:58:25,280 --> 01:58:26,560
It is it is

2322
01:58:26,816 --> 01:58:28,608
I believe

2323
01:58:28,864 --> 01:58:29,632
In terms of

2324
01:58:29,888 --> 01:58:32,704
Knowing where these weapons are people having to

2325
01:58:32,960 --> 01:58:33,728
2

2326
01:58:35,776 --> 01:58:37,056
What's it called tuna check

2327
01:58:37,312 --> 01:58:40,128
It needs to be some sort of

2328
01:58:40,384 --> 01:58:42,432
But at the same time the people who have them

2329
01:58:42,944 --> 01:58:45,248
I don't think that they have them for

2330
01:58:45,504 --> 01:58:46,528
Intrinsically violin

2331
01:58:47,040 --> 01:58:47,552
Means

2332
01:58:47,808 --> 01:58:48,576
A lot of them

2333
01:58:49,856 --> 01:58:51,904
Is reasonable to have a handgun

2334
01:58:52,416 --> 01:58:53,184
To protect your house

2335
01:58:53,440 --> 01:58:55,744
As it is to have a large rifle

2336
01:58:56,000 --> 01:58:57,024
For the same purpose

2337
01:58:57,280 --> 01:58:59,328
If you believe that you're going to be

2338
01:58:59,584 --> 01:59:03,936
Possibly at some point facing something that is bigger than the pistol can help you with

2339
01:59:04,192 --> 01:59:04,960
Yes then

2340
01:59:05,216 --> 01:59:07,520
The same argument of self-protection

2341
01:59:07,776 --> 01:59:09,056
Does kind of apply

2342
01:59:09,312 --> 01:59:11,360
Now because it's so much more dangerous

2343
01:59:11,616 --> 01:59:13,152
Especially semi-automatic weapon

2344
01:59:13,408 --> 01:59:14,432
I think that

2345
01:59:14,688 --> 01:59:18,528
The dangerousness of it needs to be reflected in the regulation

2346
01:59:18,784 --> 01:59:20,832
Control mechanisms that we have in place

2347
01:59:21,088 --> 01:59:22,112
4 people having

2348
01:59:23,648 --> 01:59:24,928
Good protection I don't think

2349
01:59:25,184 --> 01:59:25,952
Invalid

2350
01:59:26,208 --> 01:59:26,976
Gree with you

2351
01:59:29,024 --> 01:59:30,560
We have to be true to principal

2352
01:59:30,816 --> 01:59:34,144
If we do live in a f*****-up world

2353
01:59:34,400 --> 01:59:40,544
It's not right unless you want to come out and say everyone should have their guns taken away and just breathe

2354
01:59:42,080 --> 01:59:43,616
And I understand

2355
01:59:44,128 --> 01:59:44,640
I suppose

2356
01:59:44,896 --> 01:59:46,176
I suppose again I'm

2357
01:59:46,432 --> 01:59:47,200
Taking that

2358
01:59:47,456 --> 01:59:48,736
I'm bringing you the real world

2359
01:59:49,248 --> 01:59:49,760
Because

2360
01:59:50,016 --> 01:59:51,040
Those guys that

2361
01:59:51,296 --> 01:59:51,808
We have seen

2362
01:59:52,576 --> 01:59:53,344
That wheat

2363
01:59:54,368 --> 01:59:55,392
Like Alex

2364
01:59:55,648 --> 01:59:56,928
Responsible gun owners

2365
01:59:57,184 --> 01:59:57,696
Alex Jones

2366
01:59:57,952 --> 01:59:58,976
Has murdered 0pp

2367
01:59:59,232 --> 02:00:00,256
Is that guns on his desk

2368
02:00:00,768 --> 02:00:02,048
Exactly

2369
02:00:02,304 --> 02:00:03,072
Alex Jones

2370
02:00:03,328 --> 02:00:04,096
Clearly has self to

2371
02:00:05,888 --> 02:00:07,168
So taking it to approach

2372
02:00:07,936 --> 02:00:08,448
Tumi

2373
02:00:08,960 --> 02:00:09,472
Seems like

2374
02:00:09,984 --> 02:00:11,520
Hoping for one of those self-defense

2375
02:00:12,544 --> 02:00:14,848
It's possible

2376
02:00:16,128 --> 02:00:17,664
I agree with your argument

2377
02:00:17,920 --> 02:00:20,736
Because I can't prove that that's why those guys are

2378
02:00:21,504 --> 02:00:22,272
Right I can't do

2379
02:00:23,040 --> 02:00:24,832
But if they are on

2380
02:00:25,088 --> 02:00:25,856
Either side

2381
02:00:26,112 --> 02:00:28,416
I'm going to air on don't bring a f******

2382
02:00:30,208 --> 02:00:33,536
I would like for that to be the real

2383
02:00:34,048 --> 02:00:36,864
I know we're not arguing

2384
02:00:37,376 --> 02:00:38,144
The same

2385
02:00:38,656 --> 02:00:40,704
I feel like we're not arguing the same

2386
02:00:42,752 --> 02:00:47,616
Because I'm writing my

2387
02:00:47,872 --> 02:00:54,016
What's agree to disagree I think we both have good points but we're not going to get to the bottom of gun

2388
02:00:54,272 --> 02:00:58,368
Write this episode ever

2389
02:00:58,624 --> 02:01:00,160
For two people to solve it and it turns out

2390
02:01:00,672 --> 02:01:01,696
Over a little bit of wine

2391
02:01:03,232 --> 02:01:07,840
I'm hungover as a horse track

2392
02:01:09,120 --> 02:01:09,888
Maybe

2393
02:01:10,144 --> 02:01:13,728
I believe you real f*****-up place anyway

2394
02:01:13,984 --> 02:01:20,128
Okay still reviewing the Fox news coverage I really

2395
02:01:20,384 --> 02:01:21,664
I appreciated that

2396
02:01:21,920 --> 02:01:28,064
Conversation and sorry I screamed

2397
02:01:31,392 --> 02:01:33,696
I understand where you coming from

2398
02:01:33,952 --> 02:01:34,720
And I

2399
02:01:35,232 --> 02:01:35,744
I get your point

2400
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:36,768
And you've made some good

2401
02:01:37,280 --> 02:01:42,144
I I do feel like I think as the world gets more complicated and things get worse

2402
02:01:42,400 --> 02:01:43,680
I think it's just going to get worse

2403
02:01:44,192 --> 02:01:48,800
Yeah I think we're going to see more and more stuff like this starts

2404
02:01:49,056 --> 02:01:50,336
Pop up and start to happen

2405
02:01:50,592 --> 02:01:54,432
And I'm really afraid that what's going to happen is we're all going to get distracted by something

2406
02:01:54,688 --> 02:01:55,200
On Tuesday

2407
02:01:55,456 --> 02:01:58,016
And we won't deal with the fact that

2408
02:01:58,272 --> 02:02:02,880
All the time that we ignore it these dudes are organising and still existing online

2409
02:02:03,136 --> 02:02:08,512
They are still having their manifestos posted on their website they're still organizing and meeting

2410
02:02:08,768 --> 02:02:11,328
And talking about how we need to defend whiteness

2411
02:02:11,584 --> 02:02:12,352
Some s*** like that

2412
02:02:12,608 --> 02:02:13,888
I'm really scared about that

2413
02:02:14,144 --> 02:02:18,752
There aren't but as we move into the future where things are going

2414
02:02:19,008 --> 02:02:21,056
To be scarier and weirder

2415
02:02:21,312 --> 02:02:23,104
I think that

2416
02:02:23,872 --> 02:02:24,384
2

2417
02:02:25,408 --> 02:02:27,712
Be more clear with principles

2418
02:02:29,248 --> 02:02:33,088
Understanding of positions that may seem weird to us

2419
02:02:33,344 --> 02:02:36,672
Like people having guns I don't have a gun you don't have a gun

2420
02:02:36,928 --> 02:02:38,976
Right

2421
02:02:39,488 --> 02:02:43,584
It does seem a little bit weird but people who are super interested in guns

2422
02:02:43,840 --> 02:02:46,912
And we might disagree on a lot of issues about

2423
02:02:47,680 --> 02:02:48,192
Get that

2424
02:02:50,240 --> 02:02:51,520
Responsibility

2425
02:02:52,032 --> 02:02:53,312
To go halfway

2426
02:02:53,568 --> 02:02:54,336
Too reasonable

2427
02:02:55,104 --> 02:02:56,640
Because

2428
02:02:56,896 --> 02:02:59,200
There's going to be a lot less opportunities for that

2429
02:03:01,248 --> 02:03:01,760
Icing

2430
02:03:02,016 --> 02:03:02,528
Is

2431
02:03:03,552 --> 02:03:04,064
The situation

2432
02:03:07,904 --> 02:03:09,696
What we would like to

2433
02:03:09,952 --> 02:03:10,976
To see from the other side

2434
02:03:14,304 --> 02:03:15,072
Put it

2435
02:03:15,328 --> 02:03:17,888
You just kind of got a

2436
02:03:18,144 --> 02:03:18,912
Juno quota

2437
02:03:19,168 --> 02:03:21,472
Kevin Spacey movie titled you got to pay it forward

2438
02:03:21,728 --> 02:03:22,496
Amazon

2439
02:03:22,752 --> 02:03:25,568
Or else we're just being the petulant children who are like

2440
02:03:25,824 --> 02:03:27,872
You don't do it so we're not going to either

2441
02:03:29,408 --> 02:03:31,456
I want reasonable Republicans and

2442
02:03:31,712 --> 02:03:32,736
Conservative-minded folks

2443
02:03:32,992 --> 02:03:37,088
To come on board and realize that hey there's nothing weird about being gay

2444
02:03:37,344 --> 02:03:39,392
Or the trans people are real people

2445
02:03:39,648 --> 02:03:41,184
And they're not crazy

2446
02:03:41,696 --> 02:03:43,232
I would love for those sort of

2447
02:03:43,488 --> 02:03:44,256
Social thing

2448
02:03:44,512 --> 02:03:46,304
We firmly believe in

2449
02:03:48,352 --> 02:03:51,680
Wheeler I'd love to see it more allies ship from that side

2450
02:03:53,472 --> 02:03:54,752
Icing

2451
02:03:55,008 --> 02:03:59,104
Right but that doesn't mean we don't still have a responsibility to be bigger

2452
02:04:00,640 --> 02:04:02,688
And understand some of the right

2453
02:04:02,944 --> 02:04:04,224
Conservatives

2454
02:04:04,992 --> 02:04:08,576
Gun ownership is not a right left shoe it's just with the right wing

2455
02:04:08,832 --> 02:04:10,112
Definitely seems to be

2456
02:04:10,368 --> 02:04:12,928
More vocal and angry about it

2457
02:04:15,232 --> 02:04:15,744
Let's put it this

2458
02:04:17,536 --> 02:04:18,304
Think that this

2459
02:04:18,560 --> 02:04:19,072
Is

2460
02:04:19,840 --> 02:04:20,864
A huge conversation

2461
02:04:22,656 --> 02:04:23,424
And we are talking

2462
02:04:23,680 --> 02:04:24,448
Think about it now for

2463
02:04:24,704 --> 02:04:25,216
45

2464
02:04:25,472 --> 02:04:27,008
I don't think that's true

2465
02:04:27,520 --> 02:04:28,032
Feels like it

2466
02:04:30,080 --> 02:04:31,616
We gotta get back to the school

2467
02:04:36,736 --> 02:04:39,040
I understand I understand your point

2468
02:04:39,296 --> 02:04:40,320
I do end

2469
02:04:41,856 --> 02:04:44,160
I agree with you in effect

2470
02:04:45,184 --> 02:04:46,464
I think you are

2471
02:04:46,976 --> 02:04:49,792
Hey I think you are upholding ideals

2472
02:04:50,048 --> 02:04:50,816
Beauty

2473
02:04:51,840 --> 02:04:52,864
And I believe it

2474
02:04:53,376 --> 02:04:54,912
Johnny

2475
02:04:55,168 --> 02:04:59,264
I think that is exactly why so many people have been murdered in

2476
02:05:00,288 --> 02:05:02,848
So and then resolved that the end result

2477
02:05:03,104 --> 02:05:03,872
Right well

2478
02:05:04,128 --> 02:05:05,408
I was murdered

2479
02:05:05,664 --> 02:05:06,944
No

2480
02:05:07,200 --> 02:05:08,736
You

2481
02:05:08,992 --> 02:05:11,552
If we all must

2482
02:05:12,064 --> 02:05:13,856
I let us die with our principals Ann Arbor

2483
02:05:16,672 --> 02:05:17,696
Is barefoot

2484
02:05:17,952 --> 02:05:19,232
Enjoy

2485
02:05:23,840 --> 02:05:27,168
So this next clip Alex is still going over Fox News

2486
02:05:27,424 --> 02:05:29,728
They still trying to do some analysis

2487
02:05:39,456 --> 02:05:39,968
That's not true

2488
02:05:42,272 --> 02:05:45,344
Who's the first guy said ban the First Amendment

2489
02:05:45,600 --> 02:05:47,904
Conservatives the first guy on Fox News

2490
02:05:49,952 --> 02:05:53,792
Pretending this whole time we've been like

2491
02:05:54,048 --> 02:05:56,096
Conservative preachers were on who I like

2492
02:05:56,352 --> 02:06:00,704
Blurb

2493
02:06:00,960 --> 02:06:03,264
You know that you know that very common

2494
02:06:03,520 --> 02:06:04,032
Conservative

2495
02:06:04,800 --> 02:06:06,592
Even Fox News

2496
02:06:06,848 --> 02:06:07,872
Is essentially

2497
02:06:08,128 --> 02:06:09,408
You getting at

2498
02:06:10,432 --> 02:06:11,456
Because he goes back

2499
02:06:11,712 --> 02:06:12,992
To the f****** coffee room

2500
02:06:13,248 --> 02:06:16,832
The break room and the first person who's reasonable

2501
02:06:17,088 --> 02:06:18,368
And not saying those things

2502
02:06:18,624 --> 02:06:19,648
Intuit order to save face

2503
02:06:19,904 --> 02:06:26,048
Because he's built it up as we're going to go back there and I'm going to be able to see this stuff

2504
02:06:26,304 --> 02:06:28,096
As opposed to that being all of them

2505
02:06:28,608 --> 02:06:29,120
Which item

2506
02:06:29,376 --> 02:06:30,400
Which for him is a smart move

2507
02:06:30,912 --> 02:06:32,960
Because going further to the right

2508
02:06:33,216 --> 02:06:33,984
Ethan Fox News

2509
02:06:34,240 --> 02:06:34,752
Exactly what

2510
02:06:36,032 --> 02:06:36,800
Want at

2511
02:06:37,056 --> 02:06:39,360
This moment you live again

2512
02:06:39,872 --> 02:06:40,640
They're all white Nash

2513
02:06:41,152 --> 02:06:41,664
Yes

2514
02:06:42,432 --> 02:06:44,736
Explain

2515
02:06:46,272 --> 02:06:47,552
That's how I have it written down

2516
02:06:48,064 --> 02:06:48,832
I guess

2517
02:06:49,344 --> 02:06:55,488
Don't breathe

2518
02:07:37,472 --> 02:07:38,496
North Korea

2519
02:07:39,776 --> 02:07:40,288
Hair

2520
02:07:41,056 --> 02:07:42,336
That's the situation

2521
02:07:42,592 --> 02:07:43,104
That's where we're at

2522
02:07:44,896 --> 02:07:51,040
I love I love the framing of

2523
02:07:51,296 --> 02:07:56,160
Military organization order of Alt

2524
02:07:56,416 --> 02:07:57,440
Who is going to

2525
02:07:57,696 --> 02:08:02,560
Define Free Speech if it isn't the order of

2526
02:08:03,072 --> 02:08:06,400
Well they name cereals

2527
02:08:06,656 --> 02:08:09,216
This is another one of those times

2528
02:08:09,472 --> 02:08:09,984
I wish

2529
02:08:10,752 --> 02:08:13,056
I lived it I wish we lived in that world

2530
02:08:13,568 --> 02:08:14,336
Because then

2531
02:08:14,848 --> 02:08:15,872
You can believe that

2532
02:08:16,384 --> 02:08:17,152
The globalist too hard

2533
02:08:17,920 --> 02:08:18,432
Instead of

2534
02:08:19,712 --> 02:08:22,016
People it's so comforting

2535
02:08:22,272 --> 02:08:22,784
For comforting

2536
02:08:24,064 --> 02:08:25,088
The globalist or inside

2537
02:08:26,368 --> 02:08:27,904
Because in that world.

2538
02:08:28,416 --> 02:08:29,440
It is very much like

2539
02:08:30,976 --> 02:08:32,256
People Are People

2540
02:08:32,768 --> 02:08:33,792
It's not that there's these

2541
02:08:34,048 --> 02:08:34,816
Large group

2542
02:08:35,072 --> 02:08:35,584
Psychopath

2543
02:08:36,096 --> 02:08:38,144
Who have no care for the rest

2544
02:08:39,168 --> 02:08:41,472
Because they hate

2545
02:08:43,520 --> 02:08:45,056
Are you thinking this world in your life

2546
02:08:46,336 --> 02:08:47,360
That's good

2547
02:08:47,616 --> 02:08:48,640
What people aren't

2548
02:08:48,896 --> 02:08:50,432
These white people not always

2549
02:08:51,200 --> 02:08:51,712
Although

2550
02:08:53,504 --> 02:08:56,320
I'll leave that alone

2551
02:08:56,832 --> 02:08:58,624
These people are good people

2552
02:08:59,136 --> 02:09:00,416
They have good hearts

2553
02:09:00,672 --> 02:09:01,184
They're just missed

2554
02:09:02,208 --> 02:09:03,232
Disregard

2555
02:09:04,512 --> 02:09:05,024
They're not

2556
02:09:05,536 --> 02:09:07,072
Like these are these are not good

2557
02:09:07,584 --> 02:09:08,096
No

2558
02:09:08,352 --> 02:09:09,120
These are bad people

2559
02:09:11,424 --> 02:09:12,448
Oftentimes

2560
02:09:12,960 --> 02:09:13,472
Influence by

2561
02:09:13,984 --> 02:09:14,496
The bat

2562
02:09:15,264 --> 02:09:16,544
The horrible things that Alec

2563
02:09:21,408 --> 02:09:22,688
To say that he's not the only

2564
02:09:23,712 --> 02:09:27,040
Call Pez dispenser

2565
02:09:29,088 --> 02:09:29,600
Specifically about

2566
02:09:29,856 --> 02:09:36,000
Did one of the reasons that we focus on him

2567
02:09:36,256 --> 02:09:37,536
A person who espouses this

2568
02:09:39,072 --> 02:09:41,376
I firmly believe that

2569
02:09:41,888 --> 02:09:43,936
A lot of the narratives that he

2570
02:09:44,192 --> 02:09:45,984
Expresses and perpetuate

2571
02:09:46,496 --> 02:09:50,336
Are very similar to the narratives that are perpetuated by

2572
02:09:51,104 --> 02:09:53,408
In terms of the white nationalism

2573
02:09:53,664 --> 02:09:54,432
Supremacy

2574
02:09:54,688 --> 02:09:55,968
So if we

2575
02:09:56,224 --> 02:09:56,992
Deal with him

2576
02:09:57,248 --> 02:09:58,528
And deal with the narratives that are being

2577
02:09:58,784 --> 02:10:00,576
Express you can use that

2578
02:10:00,832 --> 02:10:01,856
Do understand

2579
02:10:03,392 --> 02:10:03,904
The b*******

2580
02:10:04,160 --> 02:10:05,440
That those people the hardcore dude

2581
02:10:05,696 --> 02:10:07,232
They're spitting

2582
02:10:08,768 --> 02:10:10,048
Using right so

2583
02:10:12,864 --> 02:10:13,376
Normalizing

2584
02:10:13,632 --> 02:10:14,144
Umbrella

2585
02:10:14,400 --> 02:10:15,680
In the same way that fox

2586
02:10:15,936 --> 02:10:16,960
Snooze is a normalizing

2587
02:10:17,216 --> 02:10:17,984
Umbrella for his tie

2588
02:10:21,312 --> 02:10:22,080
For storm

2589
02:10:22,336 --> 02:10:23,360
Or those

2590
02:10:23,616 --> 02:10:24,384
I would argue you

2591
02:10:24,640 --> 02:10:27,712
Yeah

2592
02:10:28,224 --> 02:10:31,808
More focused on Fox News

2593
02:10:32,064 --> 02:10:34,880
Nesting dolls

2594
02:10:35,136 --> 02:10:37,184
Is it is it worth

2595
02:10:37,440 --> 02:10:41,536
If we are aware to use his terminology and go back to episode 2

2596
02:10:41,792 --> 02:10:44,864
Alex wants to give you the big takeaway

2597
02:10:45,376 --> 02:10:49,472
The big guys big guys summation unfortunately

2598
02:10:49,728 --> 02:10:51,008
He has a big

2599
02:10:51,264 --> 02:10:52,800
As is never the case

2600
02:10:53,056 --> 02:10:53,824
There's a big takeaway

2601
02:10:59,712 --> 02:11:01,504
The secret 2017

2602
02:11:06,112 --> 02:11:07,136
Noni

2603
02:11:30,176 --> 02:11:33,760
So so bad

2604
02:11:34,016 --> 02:11:37,600
That's the worst thing and I can't help but laugh at that sofa

2605
02:11:38,112 --> 02:11:41,696
From a performance aspect that's so terrible

2606
02:11:41,952 --> 02:11:48,096
But we were laughing over the that when he comes to the at the end of the visit

2607
02:11:48,352 --> 02:11:49,632
Much bigger than the media

2608
02:11:49,888 --> 02:11:51,168
Why you bringing that up

2609
02:11:51,424 --> 02:11:54,752
The other thing is

2610
02:11:55,008 --> 02:11:56,288
I mean aside from the car

2611
02:11:56,544 --> 02:11:57,824
So much worse

2612
02:11:58,336 --> 02:12:03,968
When we went over that back then

2613
02:12:04,224 --> 02:12:08,576
Bleeding and we saw the pictures it was just like a lady at a cut on her hand

2614
02:12:08,832 --> 02:12:11,904
Scrape

2615
02:12:12,160 --> 02:12:16,768
Give me the video of the

2616
02:12:17,024 --> 02:12:22,144
These are awful antifa attacks released

2617
02:12:23,936 --> 02:12:27,008
What's up

2618
02:12:30,592 --> 02:12:34,176
He says that the media didn't report on violence

2619
02:12:34,688 --> 02:12:36,992
At the inauguration and II

2620
02:12:37,248 --> 02:12:38,272
It's like to explain that

2621
02:12:39,040 --> 02:12:40,064
Is Google it

2622
02:12:41,856 --> 02:12:45,696
Players in Washington during Trump inauguration

2623
02:12:45,952 --> 02:12:50,304

02:13:20,256 --> 02:13:22,560
But what about the violence that happened

2637
02:13:22,816 --> 02:13:24,864
Okay but what about the violence

2638
02:13:31,520 --> 02:13:33,824
On Tuesday August

2639
02:13:34,336 --> 02:13:34,848

2642
02:13:39,200 --> 02:13:40,736

02:13:42,016 --> 02:13:44,576
Call man what about the violence that happened after Jesus

2644
02:13:44,832 --> 02:13:46,880
It was covered

2645
02:13:47,136 --> 02:13:53,024
He's actually saying that because he's lying didn't cover the stuff

2646
02:13:53,280 --> 02:13:55,840
I wanted to be covered

2647
02:13:56,352 --> 02:14:01,472
Either way I want to be covered is a story of these violent leftist hordes were beating up old women

2648
02:14:01,728 --> 02:14:03,520
Now we reported on that Grant

2649
02:14:03,776 --> 02:14:05,824
We don't have the video

2650
02:14:06,080 --> 02:14:10,944
Rely

2651
02:14:16,576 --> 02:14:18,368
The argument they didn't cover stuff is

2652
02:14:19,136 --> 02:14:20,672
Very demonstrative liyah Li

2653
02:14:20,928 --> 02:14:21,696
It's all there

2654
02:14:21,952 --> 02:14:22,720
Just Google it

2655
02:14:24,000 --> 02:14:25,792
All the articles in the archives

2656
02:14:26,304 --> 02:14:26,816
Eggless

2657
02:14:27,328 --> 02:14:27,840
So

2658
02:14:32,448 --> 02:14:33,216
Touchdown

2659
02:14:33,728 --> 02:14:34,496
Saw on Twitter

2660
02:14:35,520 --> 02:14:37,312
I looked at all the real news

2661
02:14:38,592 --> 02:14:39,360
And then I

2662
02:14:39,872 --> 02:14:40,640
Went to

2663
02:14:40,896 --> 02:14:41,664
The Drudge Report

2664
02:14:41,920 --> 02:14:43,968

They linked to one article

2666
02:14:47,808 --> 02:14:48,576
The rest of it

2667
02:14:48,832 --> 02:14:49,344
Was

2668
02:14:49,856 --> 02:14:50,880
Far away

2669
02:14:52,416 --> 02:14:53,440
Yeah and it was like

2670
02:14:54,720 --> 02:14:57,536

2671
02:14:58,048 --> 02:14:58,560

Masturbated

2674
02:15:01,632 --> 02:15:02,400
To how

2675
02:15:03,424 --> 02:15:04,448
Equal coverage that

2676
02:15:04,960 --> 02:15:06,496
Like that

2677
02:15:07,008 --> 02:15:07,776
I like the fact that

2678
02:15:08,032 --> 02:15:09,824
What they were doing

2679
02:15:10,592 --> 02:15:11,104
Is saying

2680
02:15:12,128 --> 02:15:14,176
Look at house

2681
02:15:15,712 --> 02:15:16,736
Exactly the type of

2682
02:15:17,248 --> 02:15:18,016
That he is

2683
02:15:18,272 --> 02:15:18,784
That he is

2684
02:15:19,552 --> 02:15:21,088
I feel very sad because

2685
02:15:21,344 --> 02:15:27,232

Photos of hot women

2706
02:17:02,208 --> 02:17:05,792

02:17:10,144 --> 02:17:15,520
African American lady

2709
02:17:19,360 --> 02:17:21,152
The actual person was involved

2710
02:17:21,408 --> 02:17:22,944
With the scam or not

2711
02:17:23,200 --> 02:17:29,344

2726
02:18:05,952 --> 02:18:09,536
If I want to find a hot lady in my area tonight

2727
02:18:10,048 --> 02:18:16,192
You got a little tiny URL

2728
02:18:16,448 --> 02:18:19,008
Explain half of my experience on Tinder

2729
02:18:19,264 --> 02:18:21,568
But

2730
02:18:21,824 --> 02:18:27,968
The idea that Alex is even bringing that

2731
02:18:28,224 --> 02:18:29,504
Amazon

2732
02:18:30,272 --> 02:18:32,832
Talk about your boy let's talk about

2733
02:18:33,088 --> 02:18:34,368
Luring in real life

2734
02:18:36,672 --> 02:18:41,024
What is the organization

2735
02:18:41,536 --> 02:18:42,048
This group

2736
02:18:42,304 --> 02:18:44,096
That that Timothy McVeigh was involved

2737
02:18:45,632 --> 02:18:47,424
It wasn't that they planned

2738
02:18:49,216 --> 02:18:51,008
I don't know I don't know enough about it

2739
02:18:51,264 --> 02:18:55,104
I just I researched as much as it its existence

2740
02:18:55,616 --> 02:18:56,384
In the 90s

2741
02:18:56,896 --> 02:18:58,176
When did the Murrah building

2742
02:19:00,224 --> 02:19:00,992
Did they ever

2743
02:19:01,504 --> 02:19:02,784
Build the cities like

2744
02:19:05,600 --> 02:19:07,392
I don't know when it was

2745
02:19:07,904 --> 02:19:12,512
Specifically about whether or not it was run by the Southern Poverty Law Center

2746
02:19:12,768 --> 02:19:15,584
Because that's the claim that Alex makes

2747
02:19:17,632 --> 02:19:20,960
I'll be the first to admit that I don't know everything about their hair

2748
02:19:22,752 --> 02:19:25,824
Whether or not

2749
02:19:31,200 --> 02:19:32,736
So yeah

2750
02:19:35,552 --> 02:19:37,088
That was a computer sound

2751
02:19:38,368 --> 02:19:40,672
So he was expressing

2752
02:19:40,928 --> 02:19:44,256
Basically that

2753
02:19:44,512 --> 02:19:47,072
I'm so they had to create some

2754
02:19:47,328 --> 02:19:49,632
Expound on that a little

2755
02:19:49,888 --> 02:19:50,400
Atmore

2756
02:19:50,656 --> 02:19:51,936
By being a white supremacist

2757
02:19:52,192 --> 02:19:53,472
It's hard to find him though

2758
02:19:53,984 --> 02:19:57,056
Studios are

2759
02:20:10,112 --> 02:20:10,624
Chalmette

2760
02:20:19,840 --> 02:20:22,400
Cuz I didn't have a Sprite I like Gavin beginners

2761
02:20:34,944 --> 02:20:36,224
Just to make us look stupid

2762
02:20:42,880 --> 02:20:44,672
Wait for it

2763
02:20:45,184 --> 02:20:46,976
General officer

2764
02:20:52,096 --> 02:20:53,376
This is how they do it

2765
02:20:53,632 --> 02:20:55,936
Theater

2766
02:21:05,920 --> 02:21:06,944
Computers

2767
02:21:19,232 --> 02:21:19,744
Ron

2768
02:21:20,000 --> 02:21:22,816
Based on everything Alex believes about

2769
02:21:23,328 --> 02:21:26,912
Kratz

2770
02:21:27,168 --> 02:21:30,496
Be thrilled at the idea of being able to search faces

2771
02:21:30,752 --> 02:21:36,896
That seems like something you be very again

2772
02:21:39,456 --> 02:21:40,224
Do you want some light

2773
02:21:40,736 --> 02:21:44,832
Right

2774
02:21:45,088 --> 02:21:45,856
Control over all of

2775
02:21:46,112 --> 02:21:48,416
While presenting it is I'm against all of

2776
02:21:51,488 --> 02:21:57,632
What's the government to know exactly who you are where you are and everything that you're doing it all-time database

2777
02:21:57,888 --> 02:21:59,680
Why this is a bad thing crazy

2778
02:22:04,032 --> 02:22:04,800
Chimeras

2779
02:22:05,312 --> 02:22:06,336
Okay

2780
02:22:06,848 --> 02:22:08,640
The f****** idea that

2781
02:22:08,896 --> 02:22:15,040
Like I have my rallies and then two guys in Klan robes come up to me and they're like we love you Alex Jones

2782
02:22:15,296 --> 02:22:16,576
Find out there

2783
02:22:16,832 --> 02:22:20,160
I don't believe any of that story except clam people said they loved it

2784
02:22:20,416 --> 02:22:26,560
I don't believe it maybe says our class

2785
02:22:26,816 --> 02:22:31,936
Doesn't preclude in the wrong way

2786
02:22:32,448 --> 02:22:33,472
But

2787
02:22:33,728 --> 02:22:36,032
He has one hundred percent right

2788
02:22:36,288 --> 02:22:39,360
That makes me more scared that said people are in the clan

2789
02:22:39,616 --> 02:22:44,224
Also that the saying that that's the reason he doesn't do more Rally's

2790
02:22:44,480 --> 02:22:50,624
And stuff like that I remember him doing was the one where Eric Andre got onstage and clowns on it

2791
02:22:50,880 --> 02:22:54,720
I think it's possible

2792
02:22:54,976 --> 02:22:56,512
Going to get clean.

2793
02:22:56,768 --> 02:23:02,912
O'Reilly Eric Andre Woods

2794
02:23:04,448 --> 02:23:07,776
But I think that's more the reason Alex Jones doesn't do more Rally's

2795
02:23:08,032 --> 02:23:09,056
He knows that he is

2796
02:23:09,312 --> 02:23:10,336
So

2797
02:23:10,592 --> 02:23:15,200
Look at it goes back to be talked about 2 hours ago it's now

2798
02:23:16,480 --> 02:23:21,088
You be very easy to publicly expose him if he is it in public rally

2799
02:23:21,344 --> 02:23:23,392
Cuz there are a growing number of revolts

2800
02:23:23,648 --> 02:23:24,160
Such as myself

2801
02:23:24,416 --> 02:23:25,440
Who aren't afraid of his Auto

2802
02:23:28,768 --> 02:23:34,912
If I were a little bit of would not be afraid

2803
02:23:35,168 --> 02:23:41,312
For the opportunity to poke holes in his entire world

2804
02:23:41,568 --> 02:23:47,712
Actors but I'm not scared of him beating me up for the opportunity to

2805
02:23:47,968 --> 02:23:48,480
Face in public

2806
02:23:48,736 --> 02:23:50,272
Through words

2807
02:23:51,552 --> 02:23:52,320
Anyway

2808
02:23:53,088 --> 02:23:53,856
Words are bullets

2809
02:23:54,368 --> 02:23:56,160
Anyway this next clip

2810
02:23:56,672 --> 02:23:58,720
Just a bunch of nonsense and it gets back to White ship

2811
02:23:58,976 --> 02:24:01,024
Yeah exactly

2812
02:24:02,048 --> 02:24:04,096
Liberal

2813
02:24:16,128 --> 02:24:17,920
Wait what

2814
02:24:19,200 --> 02:24:21,248
He's so upset all my God

2815
02:24:25,344 --> 02:24:25,856
Wait what

2816
02:24:27,392 --> 02:24:33,536
I should be clear he's still doing his analysis of Fox News so it sounds like

2817
02:24:33,792 --> 02:24:39,936
Audible on the video

2818
02:24:40,448 --> 02:24:42,240
It's very shoddy production

2819
02:24:42,496 --> 02:24:48,128
Whatever you want whenever nobody knows what you're fighting

2820
02:24:48,384 --> 02:24:49,920
Screen shaking his head and being like

2821
02:24:52,224 --> 02:24:52,736
Anyway

2822
02:25:20,896 --> 02:25:26,272
Other people

2823
02:25:39,072 --> 02:25:39,584
Me too

2824
02:25:40,096 --> 02:25:41,632
What do you think

2825
02:25:42,912 --> 02:25:43,680
Wait is that a life

2826
02:25:43,936 --> 02:25:44,448
No

2827
02:25:45,216 --> 02:25:45,728
Real quick

2828
02:25:46,240 --> 02:25:47,520
When this is over

2829
02:25:48,288 --> 02:25:52,640
I will say there is one very funny clip left

2830
02:25:52,896 --> 02:25:53,408
Okay

2831
02:25:53,664 --> 02:25:54,432
After the special

2832
02:25:56,224 --> 02:25:56,736
Does he

2833
02:25:57,248 --> 02:25:57,760
First of all

2834
02:25:59,040 --> 02:25:59,552
At no point.

2835
02:26:06,208 --> 02:26:09,280
I don't even know if I could deal with that.

2836
02:26:12,352 --> 02:26:13,376
He does no sim

2837
02:26:14,144 --> 02:26:14,656
Anybody who is he

2838
02:26:16,192 --> 02:26:16,960
Of course

2839
02:26:17,216 --> 02:26:18,240
He doesn't care if it

2840
02:26:20,032 --> 02:26:22,592
But if

2841
02:26:22,848 --> 02:26:23,616
Still be like

2842
02:26:23,872 --> 02:26:25,664
No one cares

2843
02:26:28,224 --> 02:26:28,736
He gets off

2844
02:26:31,040 --> 02:26:31,552
Discover

2845
02:26:31,808 --> 02:26:32,576
The real

2846
02:26:32,832 --> 02:26:33,344
The real news

2847
02:26:33,600 --> 02:26:34,368
Finishes a sandwich

2848
02:26:34,624 --> 02:26:35,136
Yeah

2849
02:26:35,392 --> 02:26:35,904
I assume

2850
02:26:36,160 --> 02:26:37,184
Delicious Ritz crackers

2851
02:26:40,000 --> 02:26:40,768
By the way Ritz

2852
02:26:41,280 --> 02:26:44,608
We will advertise a sponsorship

2853
02:26:45,120 --> 02:26:45,888
Does he

2854
02:26:46,144 --> 02:26:46,656
Does he

2855
02:26:46,912 --> 02:26:47,424
Feel any

2856
02:26:48,192 --> 02:26:48,960
Like

2857
02:26:49,216 --> 02:26:49,728
Do you think he

2858
02:26:49,984 --> 02:26:50,752
Good luck cuz this is

2859
02:26:52,032 --> 02:26:52,544
Is weird

2860
02:26:53,056 --> 02:26:53,568
Like this

2861
02:26:53,824 --> 02:26:54,848
This bums me out

2862
02:26:56,640 --> 02:26:57,152
Exact

2863
02:26:57,408 --> 02:27:03,552
That's all like that's all I'm hearing right here anger is I'm afraid that

2864
02:27:06,368 --> 02:27:08,160
Established

2865
02:27:08,416 --> 02:27:09,440
Bubbly a full-on

2866
02:27:09,952 --> 02:27:10,976
Raging narcissist

2867
02:27:12,256 --> 02:27:17,120
Maybe on the autism spectrum

2868
02:27:19,424 --> 02:27:20,960
Well let me put it to you this

2869
02:27:22,496 --> 02:27:24,288
Do you think he was visited by the devil

2870
02:27:25,568 --> 02:27:28,128
Every night

2871
02:27:28,384 --> 02:27:28,896
The devil is

2872
02:27:33,248 --> 02:27:34,016
How how can

2873
02:27:37,344 --> 02:27:38,112
Before he goes

2874
02:27:39,648 --> 02:27:41,696
Before he goes to bed does he not for

2875
02:27:41,952 --> 02:27:42,464
Second

2876
02:27:44,512 --> 02:27:45,792
Maybe I'm the bad guy

2877
02:27:46,048 --> 02:27:52,192
No cuz you takes knock out of an hour

2878
02:27:52,960 --> 02:27:54,240
So now it's no big deal

2879
02:27:54,496 --> 02:27:56,288
I remember back when I took sleeping pills

2880
02:27:58,080 --> 02:27:58,848
Horrifying

2881
02:27:59,360 --> 02:28:05,248
By anxiety did not keep me up at night

2882
02:28:06,272 --> 02:28:08,576
That's true. He'll and you're done

2883
02:28:08,832 --> 02:28:09,600
Knockout

2884
02:28:09,856 --> 02:28:16,000
I mean I guess it's all day

2885
02:28:17,792 --> 02:28:18,304
I just

2886
02:28:19,328 --> 02:28:20,096
A hard time

2887
02:28:21,120 --> 02:28:21,632
With

2888
02:28:21,888 --> 02:28:22,400
With this

2889
02:28:22,656 --> 02:28:25,472
With the particulars

2890
02:28:25,728 --> 02:28:28,288
Sweetheart

2891
02:28:28,544 --> 02:28:30,080
Let me distance myself from

2892
02:28:30,592 --> 02:28:33,664
I have such a hard time being alive which is

2893
02:28:36,224 --> 02:28:37,504
I have a hard time

2894
02:28:38,528 --> 02:28:39,552
With how weak

2895
02:28:42,112 --> 02:28:43,648
Reconciling that with

2896
02:28:43,904 --> 02:28:44,416
How he has

2897
02:28:46,976 --> 02:28:48,768
Like he's got f****** nothing

2898
02:28:49,280 --> 02:28:50,304
He's got no

2899
02:28:50,816 --> 02:28:52,608
He's pulling bulshit out of the air

2900
02:28:53,120 --> 02:28:53,632
He's ripping

2901
02:28:53,888 --> 02:28:55,680
Throwing up all of his usual waste

2902
02:28:56,192 --> 02:28:57,728
So we can tell

2903
02:28:57,984 --> 02:29:00,032
That even he knows he's got

2904
02:29:00,544 --> 02:29:01,312
Totally

2905
02:29:01,824 --> 02:29:02,848
So if even he

2906
02:29:03,104 --> 02:29:04,896
He knows you got nothing going on

2907
02:29:05,152 --> 02:29:07,200
How is it that he can get off air

2908
02:29:07,456 --> 02:29:08,480
And not for a second

2909
02:29:08,736 --> 02:29:09,248
Can have any

2910
02:29:09,504 --> 02:29:10,272
Introspection

2911
02:29:10,784 --> 02:29:12,320
Texas Bank

2912
02:29:13,344 --> 02:29:15,392
I think that's how you do it I think he's fine

2913
02:29:15,648 --> 02:29:16,160
That's

2914
02:29:16,416 --> 02:29:19,232
True thing anybody's ever said

2915
02:29:19,488 --> 02:29:22,304
Meanwhile as of Friday

2916
02:29:22,560 --> 02:29:23,584
When I got paid

2917
02:29:23,840 --> 02:29:24,352
Last week

2918
02:29:24,608 --> 02:29:25,888
75 South

2919
02:29:28,192 --> 02:29:28,960
Like a good night

2920
02:29:30,496 --> 02:29:31,008
So

2921
02:29:31,264 --> 02:29:32,544
I'm living in that world

2922
02:29:33,312 --> 02:29:34,592
I don't have that to come

2923
02:29:34,848 --> 02:29:35,872
For me when we get done record

2924
02:29:36,128 --> 02:29:37,664
I have to

2925
02:29:37,920 --> 02:29:40,736
We expressed our legitimate feelings

2926
02:29:40,992 --> 02:29:44,064
Pointed out where Alex Joseph

2927
02:29:44,576 --> 02:29:48,416
Take from it if I was making millions of dollars

2928
02:29:48,672 --> 02:29:49,440
I could be like

2929
02:29:49,696 --> 02:29:51,744
Holyshit I have so much money

2930
02:29:52,000 --> 02:29:52,512
My house

2931
02:29:52,768 --> 02:29:55,584
Security I'm sure you

2932
02:29:55,840 --> 02:29:57,376
Probably offense

2933
02:30:00,448 --> 02:30:00,960
Alligators

2934
02:30:01,216 --> 02:30:07,360
Billy gets to go home to essentially a mansion and have no real concerns in the world

2935
02:30:07,616 --> 02:30:08,128
Go on errands

2936
02:30:08,384 --> 02:30:09,408
MPS concern

2937
02:30:09,920 --> 02:30:11,456
I think that's how you do it

2938
02:30:11,712 --> 02:30:13,760
F*** you everybody says money can't buy happy

2939
02:30:15,552 --> 02:30:16,832
Also money can't buy knockout

2940
02:30:17,344 --> 02:30:19,392
I mean I know the truth nobody who's ever said

2941
02:30:20,160 --> 02:30:20,928
I know that we

2942
02:30:21,184 --> 02:30:24,768
Kind of are coming from a position that he has brain damage any

2943
02:30:25,024 --> 02:30:25,536
A little nut

2944
02:30:26,048 --> 02:30:27,072
But I also

2945
02:30:27,328 --> 02:30:29,120
Do thing in the back of his mind he knows he

2946
02:30:29,376 --> 02:30:29,888
He's fighting fake

2947
02:30:30,912 --> 02:30:31,680
So when you

2948
02:30:31,936 --> 02:30:32,960
Create a fake anime

2949
02:30:33,984 --> 02:30:35,264
You're never really scared

2950
02:30:36,544 --> 02:30:37,568
Because the people here again

2951
02:30:37,824 --> 02:30:39,104
You know they don't exist

2952
02:30:39,616 --> 02:30:41,152
He knows that there are globalist

2953
02:30:41,408 --> 02:30:42,176
Trying to kill him

2954
02:30:42,688 --> 02:30:43,968
Because you made that up

2955
02:30:44,992 --> 02:30:46,272
And on some level he knows that

2956
02:30:46,528 --> 02:30:48,832
So he can scream about all this stuff

2957
02:30:49,856 --> 02:30:55,488
And the only real thing you have to worry about is like antifa coming after him or something like that

2958
02:30:56,000 --> 02:30:57,536
So

2959
02:30:58,048 --> 02:30:59,840
That's that with basic

2960
02:31:00,608 --> 02:31:02,400
Thought I have regarding billionaires

2961
02:31:02,912 --> 02:31:09,056
Sword

2962
02:31:09,312 --> 02:31:11,360
I have a lot about billionaire

2963
02:31:11,872 --> 02:31:12,384
Is that

2964
02:31:12,896 --> 02:31:13,920
The reason that they can

2965
02:31:14,176 --> 02:31:15,200
Can fund all of these

2966
02:31:15,456 --> 02:31:15,968
Is b*******

2967
02:31:17,760 --> 02:31:18,272
Nobody can touch

2968
02:31:19,040 --> 02:31:20,576
Like imagine if

2969
02:31:20,832 --> 02:31:21,344
And I'm not

2970
02:31:21,600 --> 02:31:22,880
Advocating this at all

2971
02:31:23,904 --> 02:31:24,672
Sounds like you're about that

2972
02:31:32,096 --> 02:31:33,120
Right like his

2973
02:31:33,632 --> 02:31:34,656
But that's not

2974
02:31:35,168 --> 02:31:35,680
Possibility

2975
02:31:35,936 --> 02:31:39,264
Like imagine a world where Alex Jones

2976
02:31:40,032 --> 02:31:40,544
With Act

2977
02:31:40,800 --> 02:31:41,312
Truly afraid

2978
02:31:43,360 --> 02:31:45,920
Imagine a world where these white nationalists

2979
02:31:46,432 --> 02:31:48,736
These middle-class comfortable

2980
02:31:49,760 --> 02:31:51,040
Wearing their f******

2981
02:31:51,296 --> 02:31:52,064
Uniform

2982
02:31:52,576 --> 02:31:54,624
Imagine if they stop for a second

2983
02:31:54,880 --> 02:31:55,904
That they could really be

2984
02:31:56,416 --> 02:31:57,440
You know

2985
02:31:57,696 --> 02:32:02,048
Vulnerability making them up and they're pretty

2986
02:32:02,304 --> 02:32:03,840
Pretending that there

2987
02:32:04,096 --> 02:32:05,120
That their aggression

2988
02:32:05,632 --> 02:32:06,144
Defensive

2989
02:32:06,400 --> 02:32:09,216
When in reality it's b******* like imagine if they were Act

2990
02:32:09,472 --> 02:32:10,496
Truly on the defense

2991
02:32:10,752 --> 02:32:11,776
These guys

2992
02:32:12,288 --> 02:32:13,824
Fry and

2993
02:32:14,592 --> 02:32:15,616
Because they're doing that off.

2994
02:32:17,152 --> 02:32:18,176
Spanish

2995
02:32:18,432 --> 02:32:22,272
V but that's the other thing that's really dangerous is when you have a made-up anime

2996
02:32:24,064 --> 02:32:25,088
Defeat them is to

2997
02:32:25,344 --> 02:32:26,880
Oppress other people

2998
02:32:27,136 --> 02:32:29,696
Then the other people

2999
02:32:30,720 --> 02:32:31,744
Your real enemy

3000
02:32:32,256 --> 02:32:32,768
Even though

3001
02:32:33,280 --> 02:32:34,048
The way you

3002
02:32:34,304 --> 02:32:36,096
Express it is directed at a fake

3003
02:32:36,608 --> 02:32:37,632
True so

3004
02:32:38,144 --> 02:32:40,192
It's not fair of us to say he's making up

3005
02:32:42,240 --> 02:32:43,264
Everybody

3006
02:32:43,520 --> 02:32:44,800
Disenfranchised groups

3007
02:32:45,056 --> 02:32:47,104
Straight

3008
02:32:50,432 --> 02:32:55,808
So they're right

3009
02:32:58,368 --> 02:33:02,720
He's also weirdly fine with minority women in 100 hot

3010
02:33:02,976 --> 02:33:04,512
Then his racism is

3011
02:33:04,768 --> 02:33:06,048
Precluded by his boner

3012
02:33:06,304 --> 02:33:07,072
But it's

3013
02:33:07,840 --> 02:33:08,608
I do not like

3014
02:33:09,120 --> 02:33:10,400
I've been wrestling a lot with

3015
02:33:10,656 --> 02:33:13,472
Like his is very bizarre version of racism

3016
02:33:13,984 --> 02:33:16,032
Because he thinks that he's not a rapist

3017
02:33:16,544 --> 02:33:21,152
Cuz he likes Mexican food and stuff like that over and over again

3018
02:33:21,408 --> 02:33:26,272
He's like if you make good food I don't care I like your culture

3019
02:33:26,528 --> 02:33:30,112
No child version of

3020
02:33:34,464 --> 02:33:34,976
I want to talk

3021
02:33:40,096 --> 02:33:40,608
You know

3022
02:33:41,376 --> 02:33:43,168
This summer again it goes back to that Megan

3023
02:33:43,680 --> 02:33:45,216
And if somebody questions I wish you would have asked

3024
02:33:48,032 --> 02:33:49,312
That's f****** batten down the

3025
02:33:49,824 --> 02:33:50,848
And get through the rest of us

3026
02:33:52,640 --> 02:33:55,200
The way that you start a good show at

3027
02:33:55,456 --> 02:33:55,968
Let's fuk

3028
02:33:56,736 --> 02:33:58,528
Rude

3029
02:33:58,784 --> 02:34:01,856
Well I didn't expect us have a half-hour debate about guns

3030
02:34:03,392 --> 02:34:05,184
I've edit this f****** show

3031
02:34:05,952 --> 02:34:06,976
Are you going to believe this

3032
02:34:07,488 --> 02:34:13,120
Cuz you goddamn better I will but let's get through it it's not because I'm like I hate this

3033
02:34:13,376 --> 02:34:13,888
It's because like

3034
02:34:14,656 --> 02:34:15,680
Looking at the clock

3035
02:34:15,936 --> 02:34:17,728
I know I'm not going to bed before midnight

3036
02:34:17,984 --> 02:34:19,264
Night tonight

3037
02:34:20,288 --> 02:34:21,312
I'm sorry

3038
02:34:21,568 --> 02:34:25,152
Tomorrow hoping for tweets from people

3039
02:34:25,408 --> 02:34:26,944
Anyway our listeners will think

3040
02:34:27,456 --> 02:34:32,320
The cruelest irony

3041
02:34:33,344 --> 02:34:34,880
A nextplus

3042
02:34:35,392 --> 02:34:37,952
We get to see it like a nice window into Alex Jones

3043
02:34:38,208 --> 02:34:39,488
Then how can you generally

3044
02:34:39,744 --> 02:34:40,256
Experiences

3045
02:34:40,512 --> 02:34:41,024
Peoria news

3046
02:34:43,584 --> 02:34:44,608
Asian

3047
02:34:45,120 --> 02:34:48,704
YouTube

3048
02:34:54,080 --> 02:34:58,688
That's kind of short and really lame but I think it's important

3049
02:34:58,944 --> 02:34:59,712
He hears most

3050
02:34:59,968 --> 02:35:00,992
Does the people on television

3051
02:35:01,248 --> 02:35:02,016
Gore calling

3052
02:35:02,272 --> 02:35:02,784
4

3053
02:35:03,296 --> 02:35:04,320
I don't know

3054
02:35:04,576 --> 02:35:07,648
Recognition of the nature

3055
02:35:07,904 --> 02:35:09,952
Not white people but whiteness

3056
02:35:10,208 --> 02:35:11,232
As a social construct

3057
02:35:12,512 --> 02:35:14,048
He hears people bringing up the

3058
02:35:14,304 --> 02:35:17,632
These points as like white people are inherently evil they should slit their own throats

3059
02:35:17,888 --> 02:35:21,984
Pray that goes to this hole I think that we bring up over and over again

3060
02:35:22,240 --> 02:35:24,032
Him misunderstanding thing

3061
02:35:24,288 --> 02:35:26,592
And then launching off based on the misunderstand

3062
02:35:27,616 --> 02:35:28,640
And it's dangerous

3063
02:35:28,896 --> 02:35:29,920
That's pretty

3064
02:35:30,432 --> 02:35:31,968
Regular for that

3065
02:35:38,368 --> 02:35:39,136
Seven and a half hours

3066
02:35:39,904 --> 02:35:40,672
We started that

3067
02:35:41,952 --> 02:35:43,232
If you are in a place

3068
02:35:44,000 --> 02:35:44,512
The idea that

3069
02:35:44,768 --> 02:35:45,280
Anybody take

3070
02:35:46,304 --> 02:35:47,328
Light little bit

3071
02:35:49,120 --> 02:35:49,632
Getting

3072
02:35:49,888 --> 02:35:50,656
Some of your

3073
02:35:51,680 --> 02:35:52,192
Away from you

3074
02:35:52,704 --> 02:35:53,216
But

3075
02:35:53,472 --> 02:35:55,008
Getting to the same level you are

3076
02:35:55,264 --> 02:35:56,032
Is a threat

3077
02:35:56,544 --> 02:35:58,080
It's perceived that way

3078
02:35:58,336 --> 02:36:00,128
So how can you do anything but for

3079
02:36:00,384 --> 02:36:01,152
Perceive it as

3080
02:36:01,664 --> 02:36:02,176
White people should

3081
02:36:02,432 --> 02:36:03,200
What's the weather around 3

3082
02:36:04,736 --> 02:36:06,016
If if somebody's like

3083
02:36:08,320 --> 02:36:08,832
Stop

3084
02:36:09,344 --> 02:36:10,624
I don't I don't like you

3085
02:36:10,880 --> 02:36:17,024
Presenting it as a rational thought process

3086
02:36:22,144 --> 02:36:22,656
VSOP price

3087
02:36:23,680 --> 02:36:24,192
It is

3088
02:36:24,448 --> 02:36:25,216
Irrational

3089
02:36:26,496 --> 02:36:28,032
But that is how it like

3090
02:36:28,288 --> 02:36:31,616
If you pretend that human beings are not always irrational

3091
02:36:33,408 --> 02:36:34,688
Directions

3092
02:36:35,200 --> 02:36:36,224
Yes exactly

3093
02:36:38,272 --> 02:36:42,880
Play this clip

3094
02:36:43,136 --> 02:36:49,280
You sumbitches made a pretty solid argument over the last hundred episodes

3095
02:36:49,536 --> 02:36:50,816
Alex Jones is racist

3096
02:36:51,072 --> 02:36:56,448
Yes but unfortunately Ironclad argument I would thought

3097
02:36:57,216 --> 02:36:58,496
But I didn't know this

3098
02:36:58,752 --> 02:36:59,264
Text clip

3099
02:36:59,520 --> 02:37:00,288
Yeah I didn't know that

3100
02:37:01,568 --> 02:37:02,592
I might have to revise

3101
02:37:06,432 --> 02:37:07,200
Throwing up

3102
02:37:07,456 --> 02:37:08,480
Sure

3103
02:37:31,008 --> 02:37:34,080
Bunch of racist black people

3104
02:37:56,864 --> 02:37:58,400
But

3105
02:38:13,248 --> 02:38:19,392
Has anyone ever made an argument against their own argument

3106
02:38:22,976 --> 02:38:29,120
Non argue their position

3107
02:38:29,376 --> 02:38:35,264
Something cuz we would fight a bunch

3108
02:38:35,520 --> 02:38:36,800
Tough one of the fuc

3109
02:38:37,312 --> 02:38:40,640
Talking about. I don't care about the most

3110
02:38:42,176 --> 02:38:42,688
Hold on

3111
02:38:42,944 --> 02:38:43,712
Okay that's on it

3112
02:38:44,992 --> 02:38:51,136
But I wanted him in the hospital

3113
02:38:52,160 --> 02:38:57,792
Or whatever

3114
02:38:58,048 --> 02:38:59,328
Where else would you fight

3115
02:39:00,864 --> 02:39:07,008
Where is another Sonic Adventure

3116
02:39:07,264 --> 02:39:09,824
You know you're beating each other up and then you get a loaded

3117
02:39:10,080 --> 02:39:15,712
Tops nice sour cream on the top

3118
02:39:24,416 --> 02:39:26,208
I met him one night at the bar is very nice

3119
02:39:26,464 --> 02:39:27,232
Cool dude

3120
02:39:32,096 --> 02:39:33,376
Which one is the

3121
02:39:33,632 --> 02:39:36,704
Sonic commercial

3122
02:39:37,472 --> 02:39:37,984
When

3123
02:39:38,240 --> 02:39:40,032
History

3124
02:39:40,288 --> 02:39:40,800
Chicago Improv

3125
02:39:41,056 --> 02:39:42,080
When we look at like

3126
02:39:42,592 --> 02:39:44,128
Alex Jones is negative

3127
02:39:44,384 --> 02:39:45,408
Childhood

3128
02:39:45,664 --> 02:39:46,176
And how bad

3129
02:39:46,432 --> 02:39:48,480
Things were dealing with the reality

3130
02:39:49,248 --> 02:39:50,784
The idea that he fought a guy

3131
02:39:51,040 --> 02:39:53,344
And put them in the hospital then fought his uncle at a Sonic

3132
02:39:53,600 --> 02:39:56,160
But he's rattling it off as like normal

3133
02:39:56,416 --> 02:39:57,696
That's not normal

3134
02:39:57,952 --> 02:39:58,720
That's

3135
02:39:58,976 --> 02:39:59,744
Very weird

3136
02:40:00,000 --> 02:40:01,792
I grew up

3137
02:40:02,048 --> 02:40:03,840
Not everywhere

3138
02:40:04,096 --> 02:40:06,400
Existence in Central Missouri

3139
02:40:06,656 --> 02:40:07,936
Missouri

3140
02:40:08,192 --> 02:40:09,728
Why do some f*****-up dude

3141
02:40:09,984 --> 02:40:11,776
I used to people who are real wild

3142
02:40:13,568 --> 02:40:15,360
And if one of my friends was like

3143
02:40:15,616 --> 02:40:18,176
Beat up this guy put him in the hospital so now I got to go fight his uncle

3144
02:40:19,200 --> 02:40:23,296
You're crazy

3145
02:40:23,552 --> 02:40:27,136
Beetlejuice guy

3146
02:40:27,392 --> 02:40:30,208
What even

3147
02:40:30,464 --> 02:40:34,560
Negotiate where they were going to fight probably was there a want to go to a rally

3148
02:40:34,816 --> 02:40:37,632
I don't want a burger I want to get a Coney

3149
02:40:40,192 --> 02:40:43,008
I would prefer my home turf and Applebee's

3150
02:40:44,032 --> 02:40:49,152
Everybody has their

3151
02:40:49,408 --> 02:40:53,248
Everyone has their stuff

3152
02:40:53,504 --> 02:40:54,272
Is soccer

3153
02:40:56,064 --> 02:40:58,880
Cuz he's Americana and I love the drive-in

3154
02:41:00,416 --> 02:41:04,256
Harkens back to the wonderful days of the 50s when you and your special gal

3155
02:41:04,512 --> 02:41:10,656
So you can make out point after going to the drive-in

3156
02:41:10,912 --> 02:41:15,008
Come up to you and ask for your order Maybe

3157
02:41:15,264 --> 02:41:16,032
Flipper a finger

3158
02:41:16,288 --> 02:41:17,056
I don't know

3159
02:41:17,568 --> 02:41:19,616
Is it good old days

3160
02:41:20,384 --> 02:41:23,712
So I wouldn't say is anybody within hillbilly Circle

3161
02:41:23,968 --> 02:41:25,760
Then I don't like using that term but whatever

3162
02:41:26,016 --> 02:41:27,552
Country for help

3163
02:41:27,808 --> 02:41:31,136
Country folk growing up

3164
02:41:31,392 --> 02:41:32,416
Yeah

3165
02:41:32,672 --> 02:41:33,696
Would be wild

3166
02:41:33,952 --> 02:41:39,072
For my experience product I got to beat up the Skype uncle

3167
02:41:39,328 --> 02:41:39,840
Yeah

3168
02:41:40,096 --> 02:41:43,168
Also is that is that

3169
02:41:43,680 --> 02:41:44,704
I beat up this guy

3170
02:41:45,216 --> 02:41:45,984
Put him in a Hass

3171
02:41:47,008 --> 02:41:47,520
So now I

3172
02:41:50,080 --> 02:41:53,408
Have to

3173
02:42:00,576 --> 02:42:05,440
Beaded level one right angle is ostensibly the boss movie

3174
02:42:05,696 --> 02:42:06,976
The other thing I wanted I want to

3175
02:42:07,232 --> 02:42:08,256
Take from this

3176
02:42:08,512 --> 02:42:09,792
Is that

3177
02:42:10,048 --> 02:42:12,096
Is that the same guy he put in

3178
02:42:12,352 --> 02:42:12,864
Nakoma

3179
02:42:14,144 --> 02:42:16,448
Because you did that might not be the same guy

3180
02:42:16,704 --> 02:42:21,568
And then got food

3181
02:42:22,080 --> 02:42:25,920
So maybe he's put multiple people in the hospital and then fought their family members

3182
02:42:26,176 --> 02:42:26,944
Still further

3183
02:42:27,456 --> 02:42:29,504
Did you put them into the hospital

3184
02:42:29,760 --> 02:42:32,064
Like oh he had a stitch

3185
02:42:32,576 --> 02:42:37,440
Stitches Hospital

3186
02:42:37,696 --> 02:42:39,744
It doesn't sound like you got the

3187
02:42:40,000 --> 02:42:41,536
Splint on his hamburger

3188
02:42:42,048 --> 02:42:43,584
Any of this b******* real

3189
02:42:44,096 --> 02:42:44,864
It feels real

3190
02:42:45,376 --> 02:42:45,888
That does feel

3191
02:42:46,656 --> 02:42:48,448
Whatever you talk

3192
02:42:48,704 --> 02:42:49,728
It's so weird

3193
02:42:49,984 --> 02:42:50,496
Because he

3194
02:42:51,264 --> 02:42:52,800
Ketosis off so much nonsense

3195
02:42:53,056 --> 02:42:55,616
You know like that Hillary killed

3196
02:43:01,248 --> 02:43:02,528
Strange though he's like

3197
02:43:02,784 --> 02:43:03,808
Everybody we're late

3198
02:43:04,064 --> 02:43:08,416
It's to this what's the reason it feels real is

3199
02:43:08,672 --> 02:43:09,440
It's bragi

3200
02:43:12,000 --> 02:43:12,768
He loves to brag

3201
02:43:13,024 --> 02:43:14,048
But that's also why

3202
02:43:14,304 --> 02:43:14,816
Just believe it

3203
02:43:15,072 --> 02:43:16,864
Because every time you break through

3204
02:43:17,120 --> 02:43:17,888
It's gray

3205
02:43:18,400 --> 02:43:20,192
Yes I'm not sure but it's funny

3206
02:43:25,056 --> 02:43:28,128
Skip this next glucose just about have antifa started

3207
02:43:29,408 --> 02:43:30,432
We don't

3208
02:43:30,688 --> 02:43:31,200
To hear about this

3209
02:43:31,456 --> 02:43:36,320
This is something everybody know so the rest of the video pretty much is Alex Jones

3210
02:43:37,600 --> 02:43:38,880
Just reviewing Fox

3211
02:43:40,672 --> 02:43:42,720
Experience already

3212
02:43:44,512 --> 02:43:46,560
We don't have much more of it would just have one more clip

3213
02:43:47,584 --> 02:43:48,864
Then

3214
02:43:49,376 --> 02:43:50,400
Comes on and gives his

3215
02:43:51,424 --> 02:43:52,960
Of a gives his press

3216
02:43:53,216 --> 02:43:57,056
We're not going to listen to that but I do want to deal with it after this clip

3217
02:43:57,568 --> 02:43:58,080
Because this is

3218
02:43:59,104 --> 02:43:59,616
This is good

3219
02:44:00,128 --> 02:44:00,896
This is a

3220
02:44:01,664 --> 02:44:02,176
Maybe

3221
02:44:02,432 --> 02:44:04,224
Someone expressing something to Alex.

3222
02:44:04,480 --> 02:44:04,992
I'd like to say

3223
02:44:10,368 --> 02:44:13,952
People shooting on Saturday

3224
02:44:16,256 --> 02:44:18,048
It's just I love the resort

3225
02:44:19,840 --> 02:44:25,984
I just like the idea of you spending time you like people telling me to shut up.

3226
02:44:26,240 --> 02:44:27,520
Bread

3227
02:44:29,568 --> 02:44:30,080
Petards

3228
02:44:31,104 --> 02:44:32,128
I have

3229
02:44:32,384 --> 02:44:33,408
Come to

3230
02:44:35,200 --> 02:44:35,968
Deeply loved

3231
02:44:36,224 --> 02:44:36,736
The word

3232
02:44:39,296 --> 02:44:41,088
Lifespan is cock

3233
02:44:41,344 --> 02:44:43,392
It kind of

3234
02:44:45,184 --> 02:44:51,328
It's the same thing as fake news

3235
02:44:51,584 --> 02:44:52,864
Charter House

3236
02:44:53,120 --> 02:44:57,216
Turn off our back Thursday they're like

3237
02:44:57,728 --> 02:44:58,752
A little more mad about it

3238
02:45:00,288 --> 02:45:01,824
They're more mad about literally every

3239
02:45:02,080 --> 02:45:05,664
I sincerely don't care about being called Acora lip tard

3240
02:45:05,920 --> 02:45:06,432
Free funny

3241
02:45:06,688 --> 02:45:08,736
So what's funny is drunk

3242
02:45:11,040 --> 02:45:11,552
Search

3243
02:45:11,808 --> 02:45:14,624
Live press conference that he gave about

3244
02:45:14,880 --> 02:45:17,440
This distillation

3245
02:45:17,952 --> 02:45:18,976
If you guys did not hear it

3246
02:45:19,232 --> 02:45:19,744
Petition

3247
02:45:20,000 --> 02:45:20,768
Still need to listen to that

3248
02:45:21,280 --> 02:45:21,792
There's nothing

3249
02:45:22,304 --> 02:45:26,912
No idea the cries violin to bigotry on many side

3250
02:45:27,424 --> 02:45:28,192
On many sides

3251
02:45:28,704 --> 02:45:29,728
You repeat that twice

3252
02:45:29,984 --> 02:45:33,056
Right I saw it and I have yet

3253
02:45:33,312 --> 02:45:33,824
Not be

3254
02:45:34,080 --> 02:45:36,128
Angry but I didn't I didn't actually

3255
02:45:36,384 --> 02:45:38,688
Watch him say these words and cuz I've never

3256
02:45:39,968 --> 02:45:40,480
He's been

3257
02:45:41,504 --> 02:45:42,784
Percent he's taken office

3258
02:45:43,296 --> 02:45:45,088
I have never actively listen

3259
02:45:46,112 --> 02:45:47,648
Say a word

3260
02:45:48,160 --> 02:45:48,672
Exactly

3261
02:45:48,928 --> 02:45:49,440
But that's the point

3262
02:45:49,696 --> 02:45:50,720
I've never

3263
02:45:50,976 --> 02:45:51,488
Done it

3264
02:45:52,768 --> 02:45:55,584
Like I've read his words other people often

3265
02:45:55,840 --> 02:45:57,120
Posted it and done all this s***

3266
02:45:57,632 --> 02:45:58,400
I've never acted

3267
02:45:58,656 --> 02:45:59,168
Sibley said

3268
02:45:59,424 --> 02:46:00,960
I'm going to listen to what he has

3269
02:46:01,728 --> 02:46:02,496
Because he is

3270
02:46:03,264 --> 02:46:04,543
There's has nothing

3271
02:46:05,311 --> 02:46:06,847
Does everything

3272
02:46:07,103 --> 02:46:07,615
Sweet is a lie

3273
02:46:08,895 --> 02:46:09,407
It's made of

3274
02:46:10,431 --> 02:46:10,943
It's bulge

3275
02:46:13,503 --> 02:46:15,551
Like he has no words

3276
02:46:16,063 --> 02:46:16,831
Worth listening to

3277
02:46:17,343 --> 02:46:18,879
Is my mind

3278
02:46:19,903 --> 02:46:20,415
To listen to him

3279
02:46:20,671 --> 02:46:23,487
Even North Korea whenever he says

3280
02:46:23,743 --> 02:46:26,815
Oh I'm going to Nuke North Korea even there like

3281
02:46:27,071 --> 02:46:27,583
You don't

3282
02:46:28,607 --> 02:46:32,191
You say shut up Kim jong-un's emotion

3283
02:46:32,447 --> 02:46:33,983
No one should listen to any

3284
02:46:34,495 --> 02:46:35,007
He doesn't

3285
02:46:38,079 --> 02:46:43,199
I don't I don't disagree with you but at the same time is important to track

3286
02:46:43,455 --> 02:46:45,759
Back in many ways on many sides

3287
02:46:46,015 --> 02:46:46,527
As it were

3288
02:46:47,039 --> 02:46:47,807
Because

3289
02:46:48,319 --> 02:46:49,087
Hip Hop

3290
02:46:49,599 --> 02:46:53,695
Implies

3291
02:46:53,951 --> 02:46:55,999
That what he believes or what he would like to

3292
02:46:56,255 --> 02:46:56,767
Express

3293
02:46:58,815 --> 02:47:03,423
Mistakes were made on all sides as opposed to

3294
02:47:05,471 --> 02:47:05,983
Inspiration

3295
02:47:10,079 --> 02:47:11,871
Free murder and Heather

3296
02:47:12,895 --> 02:47:15,199
And brother was murdered

3297
02:47:16,479 --> 02:47:19,039
The reason that it's important that he

3298
02:47:19,551 --> 02:47:21,087
Stuck on Minis

3299
02:47:21,599 --> 02:47:22,367
Is you have

3300
02:47:22,623 --> 02:47:24,415
Have to think about how the white National

3301
02:47:24,671 --> 02:47:25,695
What's the Nazis are going to

3302
02:47:26,719 --> 02:47:27,231
That sort of thing

3303
02:47:27,487 --> 02:47:31,327
Of course so Andrew Anglin is the name of the guy who runs daily Stormer

3304
02:47:32,095 --> 02:47:33,631
His responses

3305
02:47:34,655 --> 02:47:35,935
His response to Trump's

3306
02:47:36,191 --> 02:47:38,495
Statement that there's trouble on many sides

3307
02:47:39,775 --> 02:47:40,287
Batman quotes

3308
02:47:40,799 --> 02:47:42,079
Trump's comments were good

3309
02:47:42,335 --> 02:47:43,103
He didn't attack us

3310
02:47:43,615 --> 02:47:46,943
He just said the nation should come together nothing specific against

3311
02:47:47,711 --> 02:47:52,831
He said that we need to study why people are so angry and implied there was hate on both sides

3312
02:47:53,087 --> 02:47:55,391
So he implied that Auntie far haters

3313
02:47:55,903 --> 02:47:58,463
There was virtually no counter signal no loss at all

3314
02:47:58,719 --> 02:47:59,999
He said he loves us all

3315
02:48:00,255 --> 02:48:03,327
Also refused to answer a question about white nationalists supporting

3316
02:48:03,839 --> 02:48:05,119
No condemnation at all

3317
02:48:05,375 --> 02:48:07,935
He just walked out of the room

3318
02:48:08,191 --> 02:48:09,471
Really really good

3319
02:48:09,727 --> 02:48:10,239
God bless

3320
02:48:12,543 --> 02:48:14,079
Why I would care

3321
02:48:15,359 --> 02:48:16,895
What do you mean I mean I don't care

3322
02:48:17,407 --> 02:48:17,919
If Trump

3323
02:48:18,175 --> 02:48:18,943
If Trump said

3324
02:48:21,247 --> 02:48:22,271
We hate white National

3325
02:48:23,807 --> 02:48:24,319
Who cares

3326
02:48:24,575 --> 02:48:25,343
No you don't

3327
02:48:27,135 --> 02:48:27,903
He doesn't he could have

3328
02:48:28,159 --> 02:48:28,671
Said f***

3329
02:48:29,695 --> 02:48:30,719
You could have said that

3330
02:48:30,975 --> 02:48:31,743
He is

3331
02:48:31,999 --> 02:48:34,047
10 ft tall

3332
02:48:34,303 --> 02:48:34,815
Just as much

3333
02:48:35,071 --> 02:48:37,887
As if he condemned it

3334
02:48:39,423 --> 02:48:40,191
It doesn't mean

3335
02:48:40,447 --> 02:48:41,727
It does

3336
02:48:41,983 --> 02:48:44,799
The I agree with you that there's a lot of lies ahead

3337
02:48:47,615 --> 02:48:50,943
But I think it does matter in this sense because of the apps

3338
02:48:51,455 --> 02:48:51,967
Subway

3339
02:48:52,223 --> 02:48:52,735
Should have said

3340
02:48:53,503 --> 02:48:54,271
You know what I mean like

3341
02:48:54,527 --> 02:48:59,135
It's beyond dog whistle to these

3342
02:48:59,391 --> 02:49:00,671
Nazis and white supremacist

3343
02:49:00,927 --> 02:49:01,695
Do not

3344
02:49:02,463 --> 02:49:03,999
The president of the United States

3345
02:49:04,255 --> 02:49:06,559
Specifically condemn their hate rhetoric

3346
02:49:06,815 --> 02:49:08,607
I have a condemned people filing

3347
02:49:09,887 --> 02:49:10,655
Not to condemn

3348
02:49:11,167 --> 02:49:12,447
People screaming bloody

3349
02:49:12,703 --> 02:49:13,215
Soil

3350
02:49:13,471 --> 02:49:14,495
Not to condemn

3351
02:49:15,007 --> 02:49:15,519
People

3352
02:49:15,775 --> 02:49:16,543
Outright

3353
02:49:16,799 --> 02:49:17,567
Being

3354
02:49:17,823 --> 02:49:18,591
Publicly

3355
02:49:19,103 --> 02:49:20,639
Thrilled to be members of

3356
02:49:20,895 --> 02:49:21,919
Of Nazi Oregon

3357
02:49:22,175 --> 02:49:22,687
Innovations

3358
02:49:22,943 --> 02:49:23,967
To not condemn

3359
02:49:24,479 --> 02:49:26,271
Someone who was involved with

3360
02:49:26,527 --> 02:49:27,551
Released

3361
02:49:27,807 --> 02:49:30,367
Wildly official capacity

3362
02:49:30,623 --> 02:49:33,183
Vanguard America directly murdering

3363
02:49:33,439 --> 02:49:36,511
Somebody

3364
02:49:37,023 --> 02:49:40,095
Is much bigger than anything you could have possibly said

3365
02:49:40,351 --> 02:49:41,375
Because it gives them

3366
02:49:41,631 --> 02:49:42,655
Tacit acceptance

3367
02:49:43,167 --> 02:49:43,935
It tells them

3368
02:49:44,191 --> 02:49:45,215
It's okay

3369
02:49:45,727 --> 02:49:48,031
In the same way that when David Duke was there

3370
02:49:48,287 --> 02:49:49,311
Are you saying

3371
02:49:49,567 --> 02:49:52,383
That this were fulfilling the promises of Donald Trump

3372
02:49:53,151 --> 02:49:53,919
It's white

3373
02:49:54,175 --> 02:49:55,455
I know

3374
02:49:55,711 --> 02:49:56,479
And I get that

3375
02:49:57,503 --> 02:49:58,527
And if we lived

3376
02:50:00,063 --> 02:50:00,831
If Trump was

3377
02:50:01,087 --> 02:50:01,599
Anybody else

3378
02:50:02,623 --> 02:50:03,391
I would agree with

3379
02:50:04,415 --> 02:50:04,927
But

3380
02:50:07,487 --> 02:50:07,999
War games

3381
02:50:08,767 --> 02:50:10,303
Right comes out

3382
02:50:10,815 --> 02:50:11,327
He says

3383
02:50:11,583 --> 02:50:13,119
We will not accept white Nash

3384
02:50:13,631 --> 02:50:14,655
Write what they were

3385
02:50:15,167 --> 02:50:16,959
Is there

3386
02:50:18,495 --> 02:50:20,287
Doesn't mean anything

3387
02:50:20,543 --> 02:50:23,103
Give me directions because he is

3388
02:50:23,359 --> 02:50:24,127
Supporting them

3389
02:50:24,895 --> 02:50:25,407
Regard

3390
02:50:25,919 --> 02:50:28,991
If you if you say I condemn white Nashua

3391
02:50:29,503 --> 02:50:30,783
And you have Jeff

3392
02:50:31,295 --> 02:50:32,831
Say we're not going to investigate whitener

3393
02:50:33,855 --> 02:50:35,135
Doesn't matter

3394
02:50:35,391 --> 02:50:36,159
Whatever it is

3395
02:50:36,415 --> 02:50:37,183
F****** says

3396
02:50:37,439 --> 02:50:38,719
Based on what he's done

3397
02:50:38,975 --> 02:50:40,767
He is supporting

3398
02:50:41,279 --> 02:50:43,839
I don't give a s*** if you can or not

3399
02:50:44,095 --> 02:50:44,607
He's f******

3400
02:50:44,863 --> 02:50:46,143
He's a liar

3401
02:50:46,399 --> 02:50:48,703
And he's already said that

3402
02:50:49,727 --> 02:50:51,775
We don't need any further proof

3403
02:50:52,031 --> 02:50:53,311
I agree

3404
02:50:53,567 --> 02:50:56,127
People are surprised at this that boggles my mind

3405
02:50:57,919 --> 02:50:59,711
White people cuz you have to imagine

3406
02:50:59,967 --> 02:51:00,479
Okay

3407
02:51:00,735 --> 02:51:01,247
So

3408
02:51:01,503 --> 02:51:02,271
Even worse

3409
02:51:02,783 --> 02:51:03,295
Right

3410
02:51:04,575 --> 02:51:05,087
Even worse

3411
02:51:05,855 --> 02:51:06,623
Would be if he says

3412
02:51:06,879 --> 02:51:07,647
I condemn White

3413
02:51:09,439 --> 02:51:09,951
A person

3414
02:51:10,207 --> 02:51:11,743
Because then what happens in the Press

3415
02:51:13,535 --> 02:51:14,815
Probably gets congratulated

3416
02:51:15,071 --> 02:51:16,095
Yep

3417
02:51:16,351 --> 02:51:17,887
And he still supports White

3418
02:51:18,399 --> 02:51:21,471
Yeah but his daughter said

3419
02:51:21,983 --> 02:51:23,007
We don't have any place

3420
02:51:23,263 --> 02:51:24,031
It's for white National

3421
02:51:26,079 --> 02:51:27,615
Hey Google the fuc what

3422
02:51:29,151 --> 02:51:29,919
You piles of garbage

3423
02:51:30,175 --> 02:51:31,967
I agree with you

3424
02:51:32,223 --> 02:51:33,247
In a broad

3425
02:51:34,271 --> 02:51:37,087
But whatever the reason that I'm I'm still

3426
02:51:38,367 --> 02:51:39,391
Invite position

3427
02:51:39,647 --> 02:51:40,415
Is that

3428
02:51:41,439 --> 02:51:45,279
It's not really necessarily about what Trump says or doesn't say or does our dozen

3429
02:51:48,351 --> 02:51:49,119
Next to the

3430
02:51:49,887 --> 02:51:50,399
Fringe

3431
02:51:50,655 --> 02:51:51,935
Radical group

3432
02:51:53,983 --> 02:51:54,495
Sure

3433
02:51:54,751 --> 02:51:56,799
If you'd come out and said I can dab

3434
02:51:57,055 --> 02:51:57,823
Nationalist

3435
02:51:58,079 --> 02:51:58,847
The Nazis in this is

3436
02:51:59,103 --> 02:51:59,871
Atrocious

3437
02:52:00,383 --> 02:52:01,407
We are going to do every

3438
02:52:01,663 --> 02:52:02,431
Everything we can to

3439
02:52:02,687 --> 02:52:04,479
Make sure that these sorts of things never happen

3440
02:52:04,735 --> 02:52:07,807
Run again they could say he needed to do that cuz

3441
02:52:08,063 --> 02:52:08,831
The Jew media

3442
02:52:09,087 --> 02:52:10,623
Is on his tail or something like that

3443
02:52:10,879 --> 02:52:11,647
They could say that

3444
02:52:11,903 --> 02:52:14,463
They would say right but that doesn't matter

3445
02:52:14,719 --> 02:52:16,255
Has much as

3446
02:52:16,511 --> 02:52:17,023
He didn't

3447
02:52:17,535 --> 02:52:18,303
Say those things

3448
02:52:18,559 --> 02:52:19,327
And they don't have

3449
02:52:20,863 --> 02:52:21,375
They don't have

3450
02:52:22,143 --> 02:52:22,911
They got

3451
02:52:23,167 --> 02:52:23,935
What they wanted

3452
02:52:24,703 --> 02:52:25,471
They are

3453
02:52:25,727 --> 02:52:27,263
Accepted they are

3454
02:52:28,287 --> 02:52:28,799
Safe

3455
02:52:29,055 --> 02:52:29,823
In a lot of ways

3456
02:52:31,359 --> 02:52:33,151
It's like I'm trying to say

3457
02:52:33,407 --> 02:52:34,175
It's less about Trump

3458
02:52:34,431 --> 02:52:37,247
It's more about the fact that we now live in a world

3459
02:52:37,503 --> 02:52:38,271
Where

3460
02:52:38,527 --> 02:52:40,063
Our president doesn't

3461
02:52:40,319 --> 02:52:41,599
Stuff like this

3462
02:52:41,855 --> 02:52:43,647
And we live in a world where

3463
02:52:45,951 --> 02:52:46,975
These this group

3464
02:52:47,743 --> 02:52:49,279
I get to operate

3465
02:52:49,535 --> 02:52:50,559
In sunlight

3466
02:52:51,839 --> 02:52:54,655
They don't have to be afraid

3467
02:52:55,423 --> 02:52:55,935
I get you

3468
02:52:56,959 --> 02:52:57,471
And

3469
02:52:57,983 --> 02:52:58,751
This is it

3470
02:52:59,007 --> 02:53:01,823
This is again one of those things where they don't they don't have to stretch

3471
02:53:02,335 --> 02:53:02,847
In a vacuum

3472
02:53:03,103 --> 02:53:03,615
I agree

3473
02:53:04,383 --> 02:53:07,199
But if Obama came out and said while he was president

3474
02:53:07,967 --> 02:53:08,991
The Great

3475
02:53:09,759 --> 02:53:11,039
That wouldn't matter to them

3476
02:53:12,319 --> 02:53:14,111
That's interesting

3477
02:53:14,367 --> 02:53:15,135
Probably not

3478
02:53:17,695 --> 02:53:21,791
I think some of them probably would have been like Obama is a sleeper Patriot at that point

3479
02:53:23,839 --> 02:53:24,607
Lichen

3480
02:53:25,119 --> 02:53:26,399
Trump is a white National

3481
02:53:26,655 --> 02:53:27,935
He was before today

3482
02:53:28,447 --> 02:53:28,959
He will be

3483
02:53:29,215 --> 02:53:29,727
Tomorrow

3484
02:53:29,983 --> 02:53:31,007
He could have said

3485
02:53:31,263 --> 02:53:32,799
I will

3486
02:53:33,311 --> 02:53:34,847
Pee on the face of Richard Spencer

3487
02:53:35,103 --> 02:53:35,615
Doesn't matter

3488
02:53:36,895 --> 02:53:37,919
We know that

3489
02:53:38,175 --> 02:53:39,711
In the same way that Alex Jones

3490
02:53:39,967 --> 02:53:40,479
Conseil

3491
02:53:40,735 --> 02:53:41,759
I don't support

3492
02:53:42,015 --> 02:53:42,783
David Duke

3493
02:53:43,551 --> 02:53:44,319
It doesn't matter

3494
02:53:46,879 --> 02:53:49,183
Like we already lived in that world yes

3495
02:53:50,719 --> 02:53:51,231
We did

3496
02:53:51,487 --> 02:53:52,255
Because

3497
02:53:54,047 --> 02:53:54,559
Right

3498
02:53:54,815 --> 02:53:58,655
He didn't need to condemn white nationalism 2 days ago

3499
02:53:59,167 --> 02:54:03,775
No but no but the point isn't still did their b******* right

3500
02:54:04,287 --> 02:54:05,055
They were going to do it

3501
02:54:05,311 --> 02:54:07,359
They were going to do it tomorrow then

3502
02:54:07,615 --> 02:54:09,663
Today it doesn't matter what Trump says

3503
02:54:09,919 --> 02:54:11,199
They're going to keep doing

3504
02:54:11,455 --> 02:54:15,295
I agree that it doesn't matter necessarily what Trump says in terms of their Acts

3505
02:54:17,087 --> 02:54:18,623
I would argue

3506
02:54:19,903 --> 02:54:21,439
This organization

3507
02:54:21,695 --> 02:54:22,207
This

3508
02:54:22,463 --> 02:54:22,975
Protab

3509
02:54:23,231 --> 02:54:23,999
This

3510
02:54:24,255 --> 02:54:24,767
Castration

3511
02:54:25,023 --> 02:54:27,071
This Nazi Gathering as it were

3512
02:54:27,583 --> 02:54:28,863
Is a trial balloon

3513
02:54:29,119 --> 02:54:29,631
And sometimes

3514
02:54:30,143 --> 02:54:31,935
I don't think they necessarily

3515
02:54:32,191 --> 02:54:36,031
Look at the beginning of it it was planned we're going to run people over with a car

3516
02:54:36,543 --> 02:54:39,103
I don't think I think that's probably a game-time decision

3517
02:54:39,615 --> 02:54:40,895
And probably

3518
02:54:41,407 --> 02:54:41,919
Wasn't

3519
02:54:45,503 --> 02:54:48,575
A lot of the ugliest Lee the out-and-out bigotry

3520
02:54:48,831 --> 02:54:51,391
The screaming that we will not be replaced

3521
02:54:51,647 --> 02:54:52,671
As white people

3522
02:54:52,927 --> 02:54:54,975
With the Jews won't replace us

3523
02:54:55,231 --> 02:54:56,511
That sort of

3524
02:54:57,279 --> 02:54:58,303
Then that is

3525
02:55:01,119 --> 02:55:01,631
Kind of

3526
02:55:01,887 --> 02:55:02,911
Again a little heady

3527
02:55:03,167 --> 02:55:04,191
A little bit

3528
02:55:04,447 --> 02:55:05,471
Not dealing with

3529
02:55:05,983 --> 02:55:10,591
The fact that the reality is what it is but it's a trial balloon to see how

3530
02:55:10,847 --> 02:55:11,359
People react

3531
02:55:11,871 --> 02:55:13,151
It's a problem if you watch it

3532
02:55:13,407 --> 02:55:14,687
Acceptable where is the line

3533
02:55:15,199 --> 02:55:16,223
And what they learned

3534
02:55:16,479 --> 02:55:19,039
I believe what white nationalists and Nazis

3535
02:55:19,807 --> 02:55:22,623
The supreme authority the commander-in-chief of our country

3536
02:55:23,391 --> 02:55:26,463
He's not going to be all that bothered by the fact we did this s***

3537
02:55:26,975 --> 02:55:27,487
And

3538
02:55:28,511 --> 02:55:33,631
You going to actually say that the people who were trying to stand up against just as bad as

3539
02:55:34,143 --> 02:55:35,167
And I know

3540
02:55:35,423 --> 02:55:37,215
That your argument is sound

3541
02:55:37,471 --> 02:55:37,983
That

3542
02:55:38,239 --> 02:55:38,751
The key

3543
02:55:39,007 --> 02:55:40,287
Was that person

3544
02:55:40,799 --> 02:55:45,151
Three days ago week ago he was that person when he was being raised by his kkkk

3545
02:55:45,407 --> 02:55:47,967
I organized going to meetings father

3546
02:55:48,223 --> 02:55:49,247
Like that is

3547
02:55:49,503 --> 02:55:50,783
That's always been there

3548
02:55:52,575 --> 02:55:54,367
3 days ago we didn't have

3549
02:55:54,623 --> 02:55:55,903
A situation like this happen

3550
02:55:56,415 --> 02:55:56,927
And

3551
02:55:57,183 --> 02:55:58,463
Oh Dad not going to punish

3552
02:55:59,231 --> 02:55:59,999
Or something like that

3553
02:56:00,255 --> 02:56:02,047
Launch

3554
02:56:02,303 --> 02:56:02,815
And a lot of weight

3555
02:56:03,327 --> 02:56:04,351
And I think

3556
02:56:04,607 --> 02:56:06,911
That what we're going to see is more trial balloon

3557
02:56:07,423 --> 02:56:08,703
Because there's emboldened

3558
02:56:08,959 --> 02:56:10,751
Bolden

3559
02:56:11,263 --> 02:56:11,775
From the jump

3560
02:56:12,287 --> 02:56:12,799
But

3561
02:56:13,055 --> 02:56:14,335
There's concrete evidence

3562
02:56:14,591 --> 02:56:15,359
But nothing's going to be done

3563
02:56:15,871 --> 02:56:16,639
But

3564
02:56:20,223 --> 02:56:20,991
Maybe not as over

3565
02:56:21,247 --> 02:56:21,759
Not as

3566
02:56:22,015 --> 02:56:22,527
Extreme

3567
02:56:24,575 --> 02:56:26,367
I guess I guess my issue with this

3568
02:56:26,879 --> 02:56:27,391
Is that

3569
02:56:27,903 --> 02:56:29,183
This still doesn't matter

3570
02:56:29,951 --> 02:56:30,463
No

3571
02:56:30,719 --> 02:56:31,231
He's going to do any

3572
02:56:32,511 --> 02:56:35,327
12

3573
02:56:36,095 --> 02:56:37,631
You might as well

3574
02:56:37,887 --> 02:56:38,655
Might as well get off

3575
02:56:38,911 --> 02:56:39,423
I don't care

3576
02:56:39,679 --> 02:56:41,727
Bare minimum he got arrested

3577
02:56:41,983 --> 02:56:42,495
This is

3578
02:56:43,775 --> 02:56:44,543
I I don't

3579
02:56:45,311 --> 02:56:46,079
I don't think

3580
02:56:46,335 --> 02:56:46,847
This matter

3581
02:56:47,359 --> 02:56:48,639
I don't think it matter

3582
02:56:48,895 --> 02:56:49,919
If if it mattered

3583
02:56:50,431 --> 02:56:51,455
But if this was

3584
02:56:51,711 --> 02:56:52,735
Something important

3585
02:56:53,247 --> 02:56:55,807
Then you would have done something about guns after

3586
02:56:56,831 --> 02:56:57,343
Vision

3587
02:56:57,599 --> 02:56:58,111
Is Ben going

3588
02:56:58,623 --> 02:56:59,903
This ship will be going on

3589
02:57:00,415 --> 02:57:01,183
And it doesn't matter what

3590
02:57:01,951 --> 02:57:04,767
Matter after Ferguson what Obama

3591
02:57:05,279 --> 02:57:07,327
This s*** continues to go on

3592
02:57:07,583 --> 02:57:08,863
Until anybody

3593
02:57:09,119 --> 02:57:10,655
Do anybody actually f****** does

3594
02:57:10,911 --> 02:57:13,215
Goddamn thing about it

3595
02:57:14,751 --> 02:57:19,359
I don't even care what Obama says about Ferguson they didn't do anything about it

3596
02:57:19,871 --> 02:57:21,151
What are you going to

3597
02:57:21,407 --> 02:57:21,919
If you don't

3598
02:57:22,175 --> 02:57:23,455
Who the f***

3599
02:57:23,711 --> 02:57:24,991
Gives a s*** what you say

3600
02:57:25,247 --> 02:57:26,783
I get what you're saying

3601
02:57:27,295 --> 02:57:27,807
I agree

3602
02:57:28,831 --> 02:57:29,599
Okay well then we're done

3603
02:57:32,927 --> 02:57:34,463
I also agree with my position though.

3604
02:57:34,719 --> 02:57:38,047
I know and I understand and because this

3605
02:57:38,303 --> 02:57:39,071
This is a position that

3606
02:57:39,583 --> 02:57:40,351
I have heard

3607
02:57:40,607 --> 02:57:41,375
Continuously

3608
02:57:41,631 --> 02:57:42,143
Throughout

3609
02:57:44,447 --> 02:57:45,215
Is that

3610
02:57:45,983 --> 02:57:46,751
Symbolism

3611
02:57:47,007 --> 02:57:47,519
Isn't

3612
02:57:48,543 --> 02:57:50,079
And this is a symbolic

3613
02:57:56,223 --> 02:57:56,735
I don't

3614
02:57:57,247 --> 02:57:57,759
Daycare

3615
02:58:00,063 --> 02:58:01,087
I don't what does that mean

3616
02:58:01,343 --> 02:58:07,487
I I mean I don't think they cared when I don't think gun rights at the NRA didn't give a s*** whenever

3617
02:58:07,743 --> 02:58:10,047
Obama said that we shouldn't have any more Sandy Hooks

3618
02:58:10,303 --> 02:58:13,375
Give us Whenever there was that other mess

3619
02:58:14,143 --> 02:58:15,167
Or another mass shooting

3620
02:58:15,423 --> 02:58:18,751
Dylann roof

3621
02:58:19,007 --> 02:58:19,775
Murdered

3622
02:58:22,079 --> 02:58:24,383
They don't care about what the government says

3623
02:58:24,639 --> 02:58:25,663
Or what the presidency

3624
02:58:26,175 --> 02:58:28,991
Already got

3625
02:58:30,015 --> 02:58:31,295
Approval to do whatever they

3626
02:58:31,807 --> 02:58:33,343
And they've had it for the past

3627
02:58:33,599 --> 02:58:34,367
150

3628
02:58:34,623 --> 02:58:35,647
Goddamn here

3629
02:58:36,159 --> 02:58:36,927
I don't know what else

3630
02:58:37,183 --> 02:58:38,719
There is to say about

3631
02:58:38,975 --> 02:58:40,767
Who gives a f*** what the President says

3632
02:58:41,023 --> 02:58:42,047
Because nothing is f******

3633
02:58:42,303 --> 02:58:42,815
You changed

3634
02:58:43,839 --> 02:58:44,607
Yeah you're right

3635
02:58:44,863 --> 02:58:45,375
You're right

3636
02:58:48,191 --> 02:58:48,959
What is it going to get worse

3637
02:58:49,215 --> 02:58:52,031
Exactly anyone's going to get worse

3638
02:58:52,287 --> 02:58:53,311
Regardless of what he said today

3639
02:58:54,847 --> 02:58:55,359
Flower

3640
02:58:56,127 --> 02:58:56,639
Really

3641
02:58:57,663 --> 02:58:58,943
Do you do you really believe

3642
02:58:59,199 --> 02:59:02,271
Well the way I look at it essentially is

3643
02:59:02,527 --> 02:59:05,087
It's like a bunch of rebellious dumb children

3644
02:59:08,671 --> 02:59:09,183
Steal cookie

3645
02:59:09,439 --> 02:59:14,303
4 x 9

3646
02:59:16,351 --> 02:59:19,679
Maybe your sister is trying to stop you from stealing the cookie

3647
02:59:20,959 --> 02:59:23,775
On your break a jar

3648
02:59:24,031 --> 02:59:24,799
Or something like that

3649
02:59:27,615 --> 02:59:29,407
When you were trying to steal cookies

3650
02:59:29,663 --> 02:59:30,943
Which is against the rules

3651
02:59:31,199 --> 02:59:32,223
Your sister was trying

3652
02:59:34,015 --> 02:59:36,063
You are as the

3653
02:59:37,087 --> 02:59:37,855
Cookie stealer

3654
02:59:38,111 --> 02:59:44,255
The fact that you're the fact that you're both being punished or both being castigated because

3655
02:59:44,767 --> 02:59:46,303
Of what ended up happening

3656
02:59:46,559 --> 02:59:47,583
AB IV

3657
02:59:47,839 --> 02:59:48,863
Authority figure

3658
02:59:49,119 --> 02:59:54,751
It makes you feel like maybe stealing cookies isn't that big a deal maybe it's not going to be taken seriously around these parts anymore

3659
02:59:55,263 --> 02:59:56,543
Eva is a problem

3660
02:59:56,799 --> 02:59:59,871
Although I do 100% recognize what you're saying

3661
03:00:01,663 --> 03:00:02,943
Of course they already

3662
03:00:03,199 --> 03:00:03,711
Information

3663
03:00:04,223 --> 03:00:07,039
For a long time allowed to

3664
03:00:07,295 --> 03:00:07,807
Continue being a

3665
03:00:08,831 --> 03:00:09,343
The boy

3666
03:00:11,391 --> 03:00:13,695
I just and frankly I guess I guess

3667
03:00:13,951 --> 03:00:15,487
It's more just coming from my

3668
03:00:15,743 --> 03:00:17,023
Cynical definition

3669
03:00:17,535 --> 03:00:19,327
Like I'm more into

3670
03:00:19,583 --> 03:00:21,119
Just get it over with all the

3671
03:00:21,375 --> 03:00:22,911
If your murderous all

3672
03:00:23,423 --> 03:00:24,703
Then just f****** do it

3673
03:00:24,959 --> 03:00:25,471
Pic of

3674
03:00:25,727 --> 03:00:29,311
Like this nuclear war bulshit with North Korea

3675
03:00:29,567 --> 03:00:30,335
Do it I'm done

3676
03:00:31,359 --> 03:00:32,639
Of course

3677
03:00:32,895 --> 03:00:33,663
These guys are f******

3678
03:00:33,919 --> 03:00:34,431
Idiot

3679
03:00:34,687 --> 03:00:36,223
But the point is

3680
03:00:38,015 --> 03:00:41,343
That's why I have no issue with

3681
03:00:41,599 --> 03:00:43,647
Being discovered by the info Warriors

3682
03:00:44,159 --> 03:00:45,439
I have no issue with getting death

3683
03:00:48,511 --> 03:00:50,047
Tired of waiting

3684
03:00:50,815 --> 03:00:53,119
I'm tired of having to pull this b*******

3685
03:00:53,631 --> 03:00:56,191
It's 8 either do it or f****** don't do it

3686
03:01:06,175 --> 03:01:06,687
Before we get

3687
03:01:07,199 --> 03:01:07,711
Like

3688
03:01:07,967 --> 03:01:10,783
Entirely nihilistic

3689
03:01:15,903 --> 03:01:19,231
And the GOP has a gun to my head and I'm just saying do it or don't

3690
03:01:19,487 --> 03:01:22,303
They refuse to

3691
03:01:23,071 --> 03:01:24,607
You know what doesn't feel like having a gun to your

3692
03:01:25,375 --> 03:01:27,679
Going to knowledge by car

3693
03:01:28,191 --> 03:01:29,215
God I love her

3694
03:01:35,871 --> 03:01:36,895
Got buttons

Listen

3701
03:01:50,207 --> 03:01:55,327
This first button is very bare-bones it's very simple but we'll have some

3702
03:01:55,583 --> 03:01:56,095
Real

3703
03:01:56,351 --> 03:01:57,119
Exciting stuff

3704
03:01:57,375 --> 03:01:58,143
Mayaro

3705
03:01:58,399 --> 03:01:59,935
It says knowledge fight with Jordan

3706
03:02:01,215 --> 03:02:01,727
Burien

3707
03:02:01,983 --> 03:02:04,799
Inappropriate

3708
03:02:05,055 --> 03:02:06,847
I'm very humble

3709
03:02:08,383 --> 03:02:11,967

I was really hoping that

3715
03:02:27,327 --> 03:02:28,095
Without me there you

3716
03:02:28,863 --> 03:02:31,167
But you did it

3717
03:02:31,423 --> 03:02:34,751
Did it there for life

3718
03:02:35,007 --> 03:02:35,519
Please

3719
03:02:37,567 --> 03:02:39,615
Tell everybody you know about us literally everybody

Literally everybody sooner or later they're going to find a way to Aurora

3721
03:02:44,479 --> 03:02:49,599
You can leave a review iTunes and help source

3722
03:02:50,623 --> 03:02:51,135
Who knows

3723
03:02:51,391 --> 03:02:52,927
Anyway

3724
03:02:54,719 --> 03:03:00,863
Glad you're back Jordan

3725
03:03:03,167 --> 03:03:07,007
It was nice it was

3726
03:03:07,263 --> 03:03:10,079
It's not nearly as insane as a casita

3727
03:03:10,591 --> 03:03:12,895
He's not tapped into how crazy all this s*** is

3728
03:03:13,151 --> 03:03:18,527
Replacement

3729
03:03:18,783 --> 03:03:21,599
You have been I've been quite willing to

3730
03:03:21,855 --> 03:03:27,487
It's freeing to just be able to have shorthanded dive into stuff than I appreciate it

3731
03:03:27,743 --> 03:03:28,255
But

3732
03:03:28,767 --> 03:03:31,327
We love you guys so very much Dan

3733
03:03:32,095 --> 03:03:33,631
Is there somebody

3734
03:03:36,703 --> 03:03:41,055
Are we never going to do that

3735
03:03:41,311 --> 03:03:47,455
It's about so I was Googling in trying to research this Elohim City stop

3736
03:03:47,711 --> 03:03:51,039
Exactly where a lot of these ideas about

3737
03:03:51,295 --> 03:03:52,319
Timothy McVeigh

3738
03:03:52,575 --> 03:03:58,207
Being a patsy came from

3739
03:04:08,191 --> 03:04:12,031
Alexandra Thurston color
