1
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:20,992
Air Jordan 5 sweat it

2
00:00:21,504 --> 00:00:27,648
I have great respect for knowledge but I'm sick of them posing as you're through the good guy

3
00:00:27,904 --> 00:00:34,048
We are the bad guy

4
00:00:53,504 --> 00:00:56,832
Stripe.com

5
00:01:03,488 --> 00:01:05,280
A little bit about

6
00:01:05,536 --> 00:01:11,168
Alex Jordan

7
00:01:12,192 --> 00:01:16,288
My bright spot today is kind of hypothetical but it's

8
00:01:16,544 --> 00:01:19,616
It's still in the in the ballpark

9
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:22,432
Sweatpants cool sweatpants

10
00:01:22,688 --> 00:01:24,736
The concept

11
00:01:24,992 --> 00:01:31,136
For later I might

12
00:01:31,392 --> 00:01:34,464
Tiring to like sweatpants

13
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:40,864
And I think it's time I took great around the house maybe maybe like

14
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:43,424
Lovett or something

15
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,704
Getting into leisure

16
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:48,288
I'm huge sweatpants and I mean that literally I have

17
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:49,568
Gigantic sweatpants

18
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:51,104
It's way too big for me and I just

19
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,408
Can't get rid of them find myself like

20
00:01:53,664 --> 00:01:54,176
Always

21
00:01:54,688 --> 00:01:55,712
Generally wearing a hoodie

22
00:01:56,224 --> 00:01:57,248
I feel like what is

23
00:01:57,504 --> 00:01:58,272
What is sweatpants

24
00:01:58,528 --> 00:02:02,112
But the hoodie

25
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:04,160
I'm excited about that

26
00:02:04,416 --> 00:02:10,048
Is this movie new movie

27
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:12,864
Maybe I can remember it's called red rocket

28
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:16,960

Unsaddle Trump

34
00:02:29,504 --> 00:02:32,832
Comparisons very unsubtle everything

35
00:02:33,088 --> 00:02:34,368
Very interesting movie

36
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:41,024
They have to go back to the struggling Texas p*** industry and try and rebuild

37
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:49,216

38
00:02:49,472 --> 00:02:54,080

68
00:04:28,031 --> 00:04:30,335
Alex Ross you know which one we mean

69
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:33,151
We're listening.

70
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:35,199
I have

71
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:36,479
Risen above

72
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:37,759
Miami

73
00:04:42,111 --> 00:04:44,671
A little breaking for me

74
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:47,999
And then we're going to come back

75
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:51,071
And I'm going to start the show over

76
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:56,191
F*** you

77
00:04:57,727 --> 00:05:00,031
I got plenty of words for you but at the end of the day

78
00:05:00,543 --> 00:05:02,079
F*** you and your new world order

79
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:04,127
And f*** the horse you rode in on

80
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:05,663
All your s***

81
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:07,199
Maybe later on West Broad

82
00:05:08,223 --> 00:05:10,271
Maybe I'll just be gone a month maybe 5 years

83
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:13,087
Maybe I'll walk out of here tomorrow

84
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:14,623
And you never see me again

85
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:16,927
That's really what I want to do

86
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:19,231
I never want to come back here again

87
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:22,815
I apologize to the crew in The Westerns yesterday that I

88
00:05:23,327 --> 00:05:25,887
Was legitimately having breakdowns on air

89
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:27,679
I'll be better tomorrow

90
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:34,335
I'm not sure if he's better on the on this episode but he certainly gets weird towards the end

91
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:35,103
That's always nice

92
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:40,223
On Friday yeah Alex was deciding to take most of his time

93
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:41,759
Talking about

94
00:05:42,271 --> 00:05:43,551
How the globalist have been defeat

95
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:44,831
Already

96
00:05:45,343 --> 00:05:50,207
Bow Wow

97
00:05:50,463 --> 00:05:56,607
It's a Triumph for Alex Mark in your calendar

98
00:05:56,863 --> 00:05:59,679
You can officially mark your calendars

99
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:01,215
February 11th 20

100
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:02,239
22

101
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:07,359
Biomedical power grab

102
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:09,151
Great reset

103
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:10,431
Officially

104
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:12,479
OverWatch

105
00:06:20,159 --> 00:06:22,719
Really from day one they launched it two plus years ago

106
00:06:23,487 --> 00:06:25,279
Does our own documents our own arrogance

107
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:33,215
Launch this live

108
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:35,263
Began to wobble and

109
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:36,287
Collapse

110
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:38,335
Slow motion

111
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:39,871
Free fall

112
00:06:47,295 --> 00:06:48,831
Prosecute

113
00:06:49,343 --> 00:06:52,415
Psychological warfare

114
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:54,207
Biological warfare

115
00:06:56,255 --> 00:06:57,279
French Revolution

116
00:06:57,535 --> 00:06:59,071
For prosecution

117
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:04,447
There's a little bit of a tone that you're going to get over the course of this episode I

118
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:05,215
Think that is

119
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:07,007
That there's that there's a tunnel chain

120
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:12,639
There's a mood change from now it is time

121
00:07:12,895 --> 00:07:17,759
Do put on war crimes trials for all of our vag guy out of

122
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:21,343
Alex is a little bit high on the truckers

123
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:22,879
Inaudible

124
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:25,951
All right that's the explanation for everything I think he thinks

125
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:26,975
So this is all

126
00:07:27,487 --> 00:07:31,071
All the problems of

127
00:07:31,327 --> 00:07:32,607
Trudeau step down

128
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:35,935
We just got to prosecute him for war crimes the whole

129
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:40,799
Everything is getting wrapped up thanks to the brave truckers who have

130
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:42,591
Right

131
00:07:42,847 --> 00:07:46,175
Cuz I will be honest what he just said does not make any sense

132
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:47,711
It certainly doesn't know

133
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:49,503
I think even if you just look at it

134
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:52,575
Conceptually you take it outside of the prism of reality

135
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:55,391
You look at it from a okay so we got a house of cards

136
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:59,743
The second they launched this operation to Oculus go

137
00:07:59,999 --> 00:08:01,279
Wobble wobble

138
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:02,303
But now it is

139
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:03,583
Completely collapse

140
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:05,375
But that's not how House of Cards

141
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:08,959
But it's collapse

142
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:15,359
And hark the day that it finished collapsing

143
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:16,639
The die was cast

144
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:20,991
You know it's already destined to fail so theoretically it already has fail

145
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:27,391
I don't think there's a lot of saving a wobbly house car very delicate

146
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:28,415
They're very much.

147
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:34,815
Yeah and also you'll notice in there to the Alex has his favorite thing of

148
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:41,471
They have completely collapsed is over but also they're still good

149
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:47,871
Flathouse still going to try and do it that's not how it works

150
00:08:49,151 --> 00:08:52,735
Got the cards are going to shuffle I'm going to try to make you play Texas Holdem

151
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:56,063
Well this is difficult I thought we were playing House of car

152
00:08:58,111 --> 00:09:01,183
So like I said this is mostly about the the trucker

153
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:03,231
Crybaby Auto apartheid

154
00:09:03,999 --> 00:09:06,559
By the way came out and got the article instead

155
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:13,215
Crackdown on his insurrection

156
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:16,031
Children jumping on bouncy houses

157
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:16,799
Yesterday

158
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:17,823
11 hours

159
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:18,591
K12

160
00:09:20,127 --> 00:09:22,175
Almost zero now in Ottowa

161
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:28,831
Absolutely just making that statistic up

162
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:35,231
There's no way he's looked into relative crime rates from before the truck Convoy arrived in Ottawa compared to

163
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:40,607
I'm pretty much certain he wouldn't know how to look into that even if you want

164
00:09:41,631 --> 00:09:43,167
Alex is very much wrong

165
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:48,031
There be plenty of crimes of people have been arrested for in Ottawa specifically at the Convoy either

166
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:54,687
Over 100 of the tickets and citations that have been given out of a relatively minor crimes like having booze out in public

167
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:55,967
You're not wearing a seatbelt

168
00:09:56,223 --> 00:09:58,015
Multiple people arrested for

169
00:09:58,271 --> 00:10:00,575
Destruction of property in regards to damaging

170
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:02,111
The property of local businesses

171
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:05,439
According to a statement put out by the Ottawa Police Department

172
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:09,791
There are over sixty criminal investigation so far related to the demonstration

173
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:12,095
They're primarily for Mischief theft

174
00:10:12,351 --> 00:10:14,143
Hate crimes and property damage

175
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:19,263
This is outdated information there been more investigations instead of opnsense

176
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:20,799
That statement was really rare

177
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:26,175
It's it's no it's good PR that is image of the bouncy houses 2.2

178
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:28,479
That is all that was going on but

179
00:10:28,991 --> 00:10:32,575
Let's just meant to run cover for the actual really f***** up things that are happy

180
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:37,951
It's like how Alex uses the image of people Milling about at the Capitol you know like walking through the Velvet Rope

181
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:41,279
That's all the event was as opposed to the reality that

182
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:43,071
Friends trying to overthrow the government

183
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:46,655
In this case one of the things that the image of the bouncy houses

184
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:50,239
Discovering up is there seems to be a lot of hate crimes happening

185
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:54,079
The Ottawa Police Department put out a press release on February 10th

186
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:56,639
It revealed that their hate-motivated crime hotline

187
00:10:56,895 --> 00:10:59,455
It received over 413 calls

188
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:00,223
They were needing

189
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:01,759
To be followed up on

190
00:11:02,271 --> 00:11:07,647
Resume context in 2019 Auto ahead only 116 reports of hate-motivated crimes

191
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:10,207
And 182 in 2020

192
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:16,607
Write the. Of time where the Convoy occupation is gone on his leg doing over doubling of reporting of hate-motivated cry

193
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:19,423
Compared with the city usually season a year

194
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,471
That's been going on for like 2 weeks

195
00:11:21,727 --> 00:11:26,591
Right so when rich people in America pay for stuff

196
00:11:26,847 --> 00:11:29,919
Generally speaking at increase the number of hate crimes in other

197
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:33,759
Suicide effects

198
00:11:34,015 --> 00:11:34,527
Themes

199
00:11:34,783 --> 00:11:37,087
So this is just something that Alex does really

200
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:37,855
Consistently

201
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:43,487
Everything is related to extreme right-wing causes that he supports involves absolutely no viola

202
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:47,583
The mere presence of these Patriot Heroes has the effect of eliminating

203
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:49,375
The crime that existed there before

204
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:56,031
He does this with right-wing protest all the time and now apparently an occupation of a city by people pretending to care about vaccine man

205
00:11:56,543 --> 00:11:57,055
For truckers

206
00:11:57,567 --> 00:12:03,455
Conversely every event that involves people on the other side of the political aisle is reported by Alex is essentially being a bloodbath

207
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:07,807
If he was there he would have had to fight his way out of wherever it was

208
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:12,159
If you wasn't there he'll find some weirdo to claim that Auntie who was beating up Grandma's

209
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:13,951
Well the police cheered them on

210
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:14,975
It's a nonsense

211
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:19,583
This is asked for him and the reality of a particular situation does not matter

212
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:25,215
The goal of his show is to advance this very extreme right-wing politics and he does that but using narratives

213
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:27,007
It's not necessary for those narratives

214
00:12:27,263 --> 00:12:28,031
The connector reality

215
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:29,055
If they work

216
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:30,591
That is true enough

217
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:35,967
Skateboards worth of course Biden wants Trudeau to use more Force to help the situation

218
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:40,319
These assholes are blocking border crossings that are essential for transporting goods between the countries

219
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:42,879
You should expect that to piss off the heads of those state

220
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:45,439
Real quick

221
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:46,463
Real quick

222
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:48,767
Okay if you say to me

223
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:52,095
See now after these Convoy guys got there

224
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:54,655
There's no more crime what does that tell you

225
00:12:56,191 --> 00:13:02,335
Does that tell me that we should have a convoy shut down every major city in the United States in order to end the crime

226
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:06,431
I think

227
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:08,479
Are you dispute the statistics

228
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:11,551
Obviously the statistic

229
00:13:11,807 --> 00:13:12,319
Assuming it's

230
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:13,855
I would look

231
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:16,671
For other possible explanations for it like

232
00:13:16,927 --> 00:13:23,071
The police have gone on holiday

233
00:13:23,327 --> 00:13:29,471
Responsibility whatsoever right there is no crimes getting reported right or something

234
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:31,263
As opposed to their actually not being any

235
00:13:31,775 --> 00:13:34,079
So that's one way to solve the crime problem

236
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:38,687
Completely shut down the ability of anything to function whatsoever

237
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:40,223
Then you can't report any

238
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:41,759
That's one way who you can report

239
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:43,295
Ghostbusters Zach

240
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:45,087
So look this

241
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:46,111
This protest is

242
00:13:46,367 --> 00:13:47,135
Is non-violence

243
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:47,903
It is

244
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:49,439
Hey is just

245
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:52,511
Like civil disobedience

246
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:55,839
Quorum million truckers from the tip of

247
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:57,631
South America to the top

248
00:13:58,399 --> 00:13:59,167
This is the kind of

249
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:03,775
Stuff that Viva sort of Legends of nonviolent

250
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:07,359
I love it I would love that

251
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:09,151
And then they wanted to soften us up

252
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:14,015
And feminized man

253
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:15,551
And now they're surprised

254
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:19,135
The people understand they want violence understand they think they can beat us

255
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:20,415
Violence

256
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:22,463
Politically

257
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:23,487
Culturally

258
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:26,559
Peacefully with very light civil disobedience

259
00:14:27,327 --> 00:14:28,607
Walking Bridges lights.

260
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:29,631
That's what

261
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:39,359
And you're going to try to call that violent

262
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:45,247
What Supply chains breaking down because of the two years a lockdown to the third world where we get our supplies from that mainly

263
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:47,295
Because of a couple weeks

264
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:48,575
A trucker saying hey

265
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:50,879
You attacked us for the blockade

266
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:53,183
We're going to hit you right back

267
00:14:53,439 --> 00:14:55,231
Show you

268
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:55,999
BoBoiBoy

269
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:59,839
Yeah I don't think any of these people have the kind of discipline

270
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:02,399
Gandhi or Martin Luther King jr.

271
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:03,679
Might have had

272
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:04,447
It also I

273
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:05,215
Pink

274
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:07,007
From my understanding

275
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:07,775
Certipath

276
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:08,543
Actions

277
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:09,823
People like

278
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:11,103
King or Gandhi

279
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:13,919
The point that was pretty clear

280
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:18,783
Yeah it's very clear cuz I think that the nebulousness of what this

281
00:15:19,551 --> 00:15:22,879
Truck and it's the laws

282
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:27,231
If you got it

283
00:15:27,743 --> 00:15:30,815
Getting a criminal trial for fauci

284
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:32,351
Is there everywhere

285
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:35,423
Baby bear everywhere

286
00:15:35,679 --> 00:15:41,311
There is a non-uniformity of what is the point of this that I think

287
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:43,103
Kind of hurts the

288
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:45,407
Desert of Civil Disobedience halfback.

289
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:48,991
A poorly organized from that standpoint

290
00:15:49,503 --> 00:15:50,015
If your

291
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:51,295
If you're real

292
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:52,319
Point

293
00:15:52,575 --> 00:15:53,087
Is

294
00:15:53,599 --> 00:15:59,743
We want to make enough chaos we're smarter people than us can like sneak into the halls of

295
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:02,559
Power while everybody focus on us being assholes

296
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:05,887
Then you can't really say that your idea

297
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:07,679
I don't think that's

298
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:11,519
Nonviolent with running a distraction

299
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:16,383
I also like really like supply chain issues that Alex is bringing up

300
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:19,455
Like there's going to be some impact on it from the blockades on

301
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:20,479
The bridges that

302
00:16:20,735 --> 00:16:23,807
Because there are a lot of trade goods are transported But ultimately

303
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:25,855
How much is missing most of the point

304
00:16:26,623 --> 00:16:32,511
The conversation led to people that are having largely isn't a bad like the larger supply chain

305
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:36,607
Totally being impacted right specific ones that are getting hit hard

306
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:39,167
This is mostly about the automotive in to

307
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:40,703
Mystery you know car manufacturers

308
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:43,263
Rely heavily on that Ambassador Bridge

309
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:45,311
The truckers are blocking

310
00:16:45,567 --> 00:16:46,335
I have been blocked

311
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:50,687
The blockade is Led too slow to Simply lines and some

312
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:52,223
People just shutting down

313
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:55,295
This seems like something I would should really care a lot about

314
00:16:55,551 --> 00:17:00,415
Considering how much you talked about how evil it is that the globalist wanted the industrialized the United States

315
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:07,327
It seems like if he's blockades continue and he's already struggling auto manufacturers in the United States can't do business like

316
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:12,191
Like this there's going to stop making cars is that what they're going to do

317
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:14,495
They're going to raise prices

318
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:15,775
Manufacturing somewhere else

319
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:22,175
Where it's more convenient to that which is Oz supposed to be super against and what you're forgetting is that if they

320
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:22,943
I have a pretext

321
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:28,319
They're going to do all three at the same time and you're giving a great pretext

322
00:17:28,575 --> 00:17:29,343
There you go

323
00:17:29,599 --> 00:17:31,647
Alex has a friend of the worker

324
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:33,439
Anyway

325
00:17:33,951 --> 00:17:35,231
This is working out really well

326
00:17:35,487 --> 00:17:36,255
The

327
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:37,535
The Blockheads

328
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:38,559
It's gone

329
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:39,327
It's come down

330
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:42,655
But also they might rebuild that house of cards

331
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:44,447
I cannot express enough

332
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:45,471
You

333
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:49,567
Talk about that

334
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:50,335
The next hour

335
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:51,871
The positive things

336
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:56,735
Across the world from Asia

337
00:17:56,991 --> 00:17:57,759
To the Middle East

338
00:17:58,015 --> 00:17:59,295
Africa to Europe

339
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:00,319
Russia

340
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:02,879
North America Central America South America

341
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:05,951
Except The Usual Suspects

342
00:18:06,207 --> 00:18:06,719
God bless

343
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:07,743
What

344
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:12,863
Aquestive resistance

345
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:16,191
Enforcement in the military

346
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:17,215
In the system

347
00:18:19,263 --> 00:18:21,311
Realizes

348
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:23,615
Destroying their own future

349
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:28,991
Going along with this either you work with the system

350
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:33,855
People now know the New World Order stinks stinks

351
00:18:34,111 --> 00:18:40,255
Stinks I don't know who the Jon Lovitz before him Alex Jones has decried something for stinky

352
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:43,583
In the catchphrase I don't know who The Usual Suspects

353
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:49,983
Goodnight, give me a little bit literally every

354
00:18:50,751 --> 00:18:53,567
Continent except for the God bless

355
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:54,335
Luxembourg

356
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:59,455
God bless God damn look absolutely

357
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:06,111
You can see that trick their that Alex uses to keep people engaged when he's forced to announce something that's supposed to be good news for his

358
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:06,879
Team

359
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:10,719
Everyone dropping these covid restrictions so that should mean that they won

360
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:15,327
But if you let the audience think they want then they're going to get much less engaged in a

361
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:16,095
Hurry

362
00:19:16,351 --> 00:19:21,471
So the best thing you could do is to make sure that every Victory comes with a reminder that this isn't actually a victory

363
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:24,799
There's trouble right around the corner so you need to stay scared

364
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:27,615
And relied on Alex to be the tip of the spear or whatever

365
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:34,527
Everything you restrictions being dropped I thought we already did this narrative like a month ago with sure we were done with this what

366
00:19:34,783 --> 00:19:36,063
Multi

367
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:38,367
I don't know if this is really disoriented because

368
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:44,511
Alex claimed Victory and said that everyone is dropping their covid restrictions back when Boris Johnson said England was going to which was

369
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:46,047
For the trucker Convoy

370
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:49,119
Because the Convoy was really exciting people

371
00:19:49,375 --> 00:19:50,911
If you launched

372
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:52,191
Never happened

373
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:57,055
Italy fee was reporting that was true then you know that everyone is dropping the covid restrictions

374
00:19:57,311 --> 00:20:01,919
That would undercut the supposed reason that these truckers were in the right to do what they were doing it

375
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:03,711
It's more like a soft opening

376
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:10,111
You know like a big restaurant you're not sure you got a hammer out all the all the Kinks first then they were hurtful

377
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:14,463
Exactly

378
00:20:14,719 --> 00:20:18,559
Like capturing a probably a wise decision

379
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:23,679
The momentum that comes from this whole situation and Ottowa in whatever Direction things end up going there

380
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:25,727
That's way more profitable than

381
00:20:25,983 --> 00:20:29,055
Bland storyline is going to grow out of Boris Johnson's announcement

382
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:30,591
No way no good

383
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:32,383
Different places have

384
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:34,175
Context for how the pandemic is going

385
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:35,967
So their responses are going to be different

386
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:38,015
Sweden is easing restrictions

387
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:39,807
Cantwell Hong Kong is tightening up

388
00:20:40,063 --> 00:20:40,575
Significantly

389
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:45,439
Alex has a habit of generalizing very complex things down to single variable storyline

390
00:20:45,695 --> 00:20:48,255
They're easy for him to explain an easier for the audience

391
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:49,023
The Digest

392
00:20:49,535 --> 00:20:55,167
There aren't a ton of different governments making decisions based on different variables and different philosophy surrounding Public Health

393
00:20:55,423 --> 00:20:57,983
There's just one overarching evil cabal is make

394
00:20:58,239 --> 00:21:00,031
Everyone put covid restrictions in place

395
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:04,895
And they're so scared by the trucker Convoy that they've decided to have everyone withdraw the restrictions at once

396
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:09,247
It's childish but the impulse to engage with news that way makes total sense

397
00:21:09,503 --> 00:21:10,015
Huntsville

398
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:12,831
It's actually had to explain the things he's talking about

399
00:21:13,087 --> 00:21:14,623
Detail his worldview and

400
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:17,184
Conspiracy wouldn't make any sense

401
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,464
Like a house of cards

402
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:20,512
That was wobbly from fetty WAP

403
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:22,816
Yeah it's

404
00:21:23,072 --> 00:21:24,608
It's

405
00:21:25,632 --> 00:21:29,472
Brinkmanship is so it's not brinksmanship that that that like

406
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,288
It's it's always on the knife's edge

407
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:34,592
Victory or failure but

408
00:21:34,848 --> 00:21:35,872
Never know

409
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:38,944
Like it's literally him screaming like Hey listen

410
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,736
We played a great basketball game

411
00:21:40,992 --> 00:21:42,784
Only 10 seconds left we're up by 50

412
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:45,856
Key points we don't need to worry about it that said their last shot

413
00:21:46,112 --> 00:21:52,256
Counts for 51 points in it's a layup so you got to be terrified at all the time or play rocking jock

414
00:21:54,048 --> 00:21:57,632
There's that silver basket even realize

415
00:21:58,144 --> 00:21:58,656
Yeah it's

416
00:21:58,912 --> 00:22:01,216
It's a it's a cheap trick

417
00:22:01,472 --> 00:22:02,240
Text to try and create

418
00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:04,544
Attention and

419
00:22:05,056 --> 00:22:06,592
Continue detention

420
00:22:06,848 --> 00:22:07,616
It's

421
00:22:08,128 --> 00:22:08,896
It's stupid.

422
00:22:09,408 --> 00:22:13,504
Alex has some other news from from the world about victories Visa V covid

423
00:22:14,528 --> 00:22:16,576
Greenpath

424
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:19,648
They're all scrapping everything

425
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:25,536
In Phase 1

426
00:22:27,072 --> 00:22:28,096
AccuWeather

427
00:22:29,632 --> 00:22:30,400
That is a problem

428
00:22:32,192 --> 00:22:38,336
A soft kill weapon tends to be a problem I haven't heard.

429
00:22:38,592 --> 00:22:43,456
The soft kill weapon is the problem

430
00:22:43,712 --> 00:22:48,320
Israel's decided to do away with its greenpath system but it's not Universal

431
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:49,344
And its application

432
00:22:49,856 --> 00:22:52,160
They're still going to be events that require vaccinations

433
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:54,720
One with Coke significantly greater risk of

434
00:22:54,976 --> 00:22:56,768
Infection such as weddings and parties

435
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,304
According to an article in Harrah

436
00:22:58,816 --> 00:23:04,960
It's not really good news though because their reasoning was largely that the program hadn't had an effect on encouraging

437
00:23:05,216 --> 00:23:06,496
Holdouts to get bags native

438
00:23:07,008 --> 00:23:11,104
Felt like the pass program was quoted becoming obsolete with the ramp

439
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:15,456
Put spread of the Omicron variant that is changed the way governments are approaching the pandemic

440
00:23:16,224 --> 00:23:20,576
It's tough to see how this is a victory for Alex unless he's been cheering for the virus all this time

441
00:23:20,832 --> 00:23:21,856
I just not told us

442
00:23:22,112 --> 00:23:24,416
Yeah I mean it does seem like his response

443
00:23:24,672 --> 00:23:26,976
There is a little bit like

444
00:23:27,232 --> 00:23:28,256
Everybody's kind of

445
00:23:28,512 --> 00:23:33,120
Gone from trying to stop things to more covering their own ass and trying to

446
00:23:33,376 --> 00:23:34,656
Keep their jobs so

447
00:23:35,168 --> 00:23:35,936
Yes we're open again

448
00:23:38,496 --> 00:23:40,544
Doesn't this destroy one of the

449
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:43,360
Giant conspiracy theory pillars that like

450
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:50,016
Once a government gets a power they're never going to give it up never going to take us passes away cuz the passes are than my right

451
00:23:50,272 --> 00:23:53,344
Absolutely anything once they have do they have them in your hands

452
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:57,696
You're gay you're done you're never going back to how it was before

453
00:23:57,952 --> 00:23:59,744
Mercury is reporting the Third

454
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,536
They're going back to how it was before

455
00:24:01,792 --> 00:24:05,632
That would be a great part of the Book of Revelations 2 missed out is it at Subway

456
00:24:05,888 --> 00:24:08,192
The the Antichrist could just be like you know what guys

457
00:24:08,704 --> 00:24:09,984
I'm going to take these marks of the Beast back

458
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:16,384
I'm just going to take him back right now

459
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:22,784
By ourselves unless a bunch of truckers honk honk for a couple of days to get freaked out

460
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:28,928
No more Market minimum of sustained civil disobedience

461
00:24:29,184 --> 00:24:29,696
Soon

462
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:35,072
Elements to do this

463
00:24:35,328 --> 00:24:36,096
Reporting

464
00:24:36,352 --> 00:24:37,888
Pales in comparison to Alex

465
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:38,912
Doing this

466
00:24:39,168 --> 00:24:39,936
Yes next

467
00:24:40,448 --> 00:24:41,216
God clip

468
00:24:41,472 --> 00:24:41,984
Is

469
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:42,752
So

470
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,312
It is next level stupid next level

471
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:47,616
This is this would be almost

472
00:24:47,872 --> 00:24:50,688
I think this would be embarrassing if I heard this on Project Camelot

473
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:55,296
Biomedical charity in the mentally ill

474
00:24:56,064 --> 00:24:56,576
Hypochondriac

475
00:24:57,856 --> 00:24:58,368
Kingdom

476
00:25:00,928 --> 00:25:05,792
And trying to fill them full of deadly poisons that are made out of the HIV virus

477
00:25:06,048 --> 00:25:07,584
Every organ in the body

478
00:25:08,096 --> 00:25:08,608
And turn off

479
00:25:08,864 --> 00:25:09,632
Your white blood cells

480
00:25:10,144 --> 00:25:10,656
So you get cash

481
00:25:16,288 --> 00:25:16,800
I understand

482
00:25:19,104 --> 00:25:20,640
Record heart attacks blood

483
00:25:20,896 --> 00:25:21,408
Implied

484
00:25:22,944 --> 00:25:23,456
Carditis

485
00:25:24,992 --> 00:25:25,760
And of course cancer

486
00:25:26,272 --> 00:25:27,808
He never gets to those

487
00:25:28,064 --> 00:25:30,624
Articles does leave that aside

488
00:25:33,696 --> 00:25:34,208
And

489
00:25:35,744 --> 00:25:36,512
It doesn't matter

490
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:38,816
Suddenly the Smithsonian

491
00:25:39,328 --> 00:25:40,096
And science

492
00:25:40,352 --> 00:25:41,376
And Physicians world

493
00:25:44,192 --> 00:25:45,984
Credible news

494
00:25:46,752 --> 00:25:50,080
What's in the Pfizer in moderna shot the graphene oxide

495
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:52,128
Preacher

496
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:54,688
Perfect biomedical sensor

497
00:25:55,200 --> 00:26:00,832
And now they're going to be able to read everybody they say with machines it's a byproduct of what you took.

498
00:26:04,672 --> 00:26:08,768
So I don't think this needs to be said but this is not in the news

499
00:26:09,024 --> 00:26:10,048
Not in the news

500
00:26:10,304 --> 00:26:13,376
Also are we just back on the Bigfoot

501
00:26:13,888 --> 00:26:16,704
Computer chips in the I mean it's the same basic difference in

502
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:19,008
Instead of a computer chip it's a

503
00:26:19,264 --> 00:26:20,032
Graphene

504
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:25,408
Scanner thing will make a chip within you or something

505
00:26:25,664 --> 00:26:26,688
Mane so icy

506
00:26:26,944 --> 00:26:29,248
Think that one essential piece that we need to

507
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:31,808
Just really deal with isn't there isn't graphene oxide

508
00:26:32,064 --> 00:26:32,832
In vaccines

509
00:26:33,088 --> 00:26:36,672
Which kind of makes Alex's argument collapse much like a house of cards

510
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:39,488
Yes and I was really confused because

511
00:26:39,744 --> 00:26:40,256
Iodide

512
00:26:40,512 --> 00:26:42,304
No idea what the f*** he was talking about

513
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:44,096
I couldn't find anything

514
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:46,912
About what he was

515
00:26:47,168 --> 00:26:53,312
He said he did not find

516
00:26:53,568 --> 00:26:54,592
Nor hair of this

517
00:26:58,432 --> 00:26:59,456
It's mainstream news

518
00:27:01,248 --> 00:27:05,856
Graphing biosensor will drive new Innovations in brain-controlled robots

519
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:08,672
Exact

520
00:27:11,744 --> 00:27:12,256
It's just a

521
00:27:12,512 --> 00:27:13,792
Funny byproduct

522
00:27:15,072 --> 00:27:16,608
People that have a shot

523
00:27:18,144 --> 00:27:18,912
Medical diagnosis

524
00:27:20,448 --> 00:27:24,800
Wow and those who don't will just inject you with it and now you can

525
00:27:25,312 --> 00:27:25,824
So this is

526
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:26,592
Nothing to do with

527
00:27:26,848 --> 00:27:29,920
The article an article from physicsworld

528
00:27:30,176 --> 00:27:32,992
To do with the brain machine interface

529
00:27:33,248 --> 00:27:34,016
Says they can be mad

530
00:27:34,272 --> 00:27:35,296
Robotic arm

531
00:27:35,552 --> 00:27:38,368
Future applications

532
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:39,392
WeatherTech

533
00:27:39,648 --> 00:27:40,416
Technology can go

534
00:27:40,928 --> 00:27:47,072
Until recently scientist had a problem which was that graphene-based biosensors are really effective but they are also free

535
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:49,120
Quote corroding upon

536
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:50,400
Contact with sweat

537
00:27:50,656 --> 00:27:51,936
That level of

538
00:27:52,448 --> 00:27:52,960
How's life

539
00:27:53,216 --> 00:27:53,728
Fragility

540
00:27:53,984 --> 00:27:55,008
This wasn't

541
00:27:55,264 --> 00:27:56,032
About implanting

542
00:27:56,288 --> 00:28:01,408
These Hunters into the brain either this one does not like internal sensors it would be like EEG

543
00:28:01,664 --> 00:28:03,712
Would it be called

544
00:28:03,968 --> 00:28:06,528
Electrode on the surface of your skin

545
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:12,928
To work really well for these sensors but they had that durability drawback and then on top of that they quote

546
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,976
Xzibit High skin contact

547
00:28:15,488 --> 00:28:16,256
Impedance

548
00:28:16,512 --> 00:28:19,072
That a lie detection of signals from the brain

549
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:24,192
So this article in physics world is about the development of a new sensor using

550
00:28:24,448 --> 00:28:25,728
Epitaxial graphene

551
00:28:25,984 --> 00:28:26,496
Which is

552
00:28:26,752 --> 00:28:30,080
Quote grown on a silicon carbide on silicone Subs

553
00:28:30,848 --> 00:28:33,920
You know like you do

554
00:28:34,176 --> 00:28:38,784
This creates a material that is as effective as graphene but without the other limitation

555
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:40,064
We mentioned earlier

556
00:28:40,832 --> 00:28:45,440
The researchers who developed this new better sensor believe that it'll have a lot of applications in emerging

557
00:28:45,696 --> 00:28:46,464
Technologies

558
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,000
Like being able to

559
00:28:48,256 --> 00:28:49,280
Have like

560
00:28:49,536 --> 00:28:52,096
A sensor that will be able to move it your arm or something

561
00:28:52,608 --> 00:28:56,448
You know that's what this article is about you can see how about this is

562
00:28:56,704 --> 00:28:57,728
Wheatley made up

563
00:28:57,984 --> 00:28:59,264
Yeah he's making up

564
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:00,800
Literally everything about it

565
00:29:01,056 --> 00:29:03,872
The two pillars of his b*******

566
00:29:04,128 --> 00:29:06,432
Applying for a scientific article Heat

567
00:29:06,688 --> 00:29:10,528
Read those graphene oxide of the covid vaccine

568
00:29:11,296 --> 00:29:12,576
Has a Superbowl level bulge

569
00:29:12,832 --> 00:29:15,648
Yeah that is that is a lot of stuff

570
00:29:15,904 --> 00:29:17,184
Pulled from Whole cloth

571
00:29:17,696 --> 00:29:18,720
By being just just

572
00:29:18,976 --> 00:29:19,488
With nothing

573
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,048
With nothing behind it it sounds amazing

574
00:29:22,304 --> 00:29:28,192
Well I mean you had conspiracy theories running around about Heather's graphene oxide in invex

575
00:29:28,448 --> 00:29:28,960
Vaccine

576
00:29:29,728 --> 00:29:30,496
I meant Alex

577
00:29:31,008 --> 00:29:33,568
I guess someone showed him a headline that said that there is

578
00:29:33,824 --> 00:29:34,848
Biosensors

579
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:36,128
Using graphene

580
00:29:36,384 --> 00:29:37,920
Anyways like

581
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:40,992
Done they're the exact same.

582
00:29:41,248 --> 00:29:46,880
Two they're injecting you with a vaccine that has it and then you'll have EEG electrodes

583
00:29:47,392 --> 00:29:48,416
Growing inside you

584
00:29:48,672 --> 00:29:49,184
Or something

585
00:29:49,696 --> 00:29:50,976
This is ridiculous

586
00:29:51,232 --> 00:29:53,280
Yeah you know it is that like

587
00:29:54,560 --> 00:30:00,704
Weird combination of the fact that we both live 100% in a future beyond our

588
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,496
And also live in f***

589
00:30:02,752 --> 00:30:03,776
Can caveman times tables

590
00:30:04,032 --> 00:30:04,544
Simultaneous

591
00:30:05,056 --> 00:30:06,336
You know like Alex can

592
00:30:06,592 --> 00:30:07,872
Straight up be like there's

593
00:30:08,384 --> 00:30:11,456
You know the God will if you pray right you'll

594
00:30:11,712 --> 00:30:15,552
Getting you know and then at the same time a scientist like

595
00:30:15,808 --> 00:30:17,344
Yeah we know how to grow substrate

596
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,904
Big deal we can grow

597
00:30:20,672 --> 00:30:21,952
Sing

598
00:30:22,464 --> 00:30:24,512
How how old is Jake live in that same

599
00:30:24,768 --> 00:30:28,352
There was that there's a story to David somebody got stoned

600
00:30:28,608 --> 00:30:31,680
Like what

601
00:30:31,936 --> 00:30:34,240
Growing substrate and

602
00:30:34,496 --> 00:30:40,640
Stoning people in the same day I don't know did you ever like grow salt crystals when you were a kid and like science class

603
00:30:44,736 --> 00:30:50,112
I think it might be close

604
00:30:50,368 --> 00:30:52,160
Yeah it's a little disoriented

605
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:56,768
Between state that you live in today

606
00:30:58,816 --> 00:31:02,912
So that's why we were treated to listening to Alex and bewildered

607
00:31:03,168 --> 00:31:03,680
That's where we live

608
00:31:03,936 --> 00:31:07,776
So Alex has heard someone is not happy

609
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:09,312
About the

610
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:10,848
The trucker

611
00:31:11,104 --> 00:31:13,664
And this is a person who's like an undersecretary

612
00:31:14,944 --> 00:31:15,712
Something something

613
00:31:15,968 --> 00:31:19,040
Apartment I don't remember I don't even remember who this person is quite frankly

614
00:31:20,064 --> 00:31:22,368
This lady got on

615
00:31:22,624 --> 00:31:23,136
CNN

616
00:31:23,392 --> 00:31:25,184
A pleated also about how you

617
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,464
Flash their tires

618
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,768
Edit move the trucks

619
00:31:29,024 --> 00:31:30,304
Alex's is

620
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:33,888
Really upset about these comments cuz he's super into this

621
00:31:34,144 --> 00:31:36,448
This this Convoy he wants to make it his own

622
00:31:38,752 --> 00:31:39,520
His complaint

623
00:31:39,776 --> 00:31:40,544
About this woman

624
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:43,360
Seems to be largely centered around the idea

625
00:31:43,616 --> 00:31:46,688
That if you slash the tires then you can't move the trucks

626
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:53,344
It seems to be him complaining about how this woman this woman doesn't know about truck

627
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:55,904
Just a bad boy. It's very bizarre

628
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:57,440
Former deputy had

629
00:31:57,696 --> 00:31:58,976
Homeland Security

630
00:32:02,816 --> 00:32:03,328
Coming out

631
00:32:06,144 --> 00:32:06,912
Mom singing in in

632
00:32:11,264 --> 00:32:13,312
Oxymoronic

633
00:32:13,568 --> 00:32:15,872
Arrest the drivers

634
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:20,480
A professor and CNN analyst calls for violence against Freedom Conway

635
00:32:21,248 --> 00:32:22,784
But if you slashed the tires

636
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,112
But even you can't move the trucks

637
00:32:28,672 --> 00:32:30,208
But she doesn't seem to understand that

638
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:36,096
Harvard professor CNN analyst former Obama administration under Secretary of Homeland Security

639
00:32:39,168 --> 00:32:41,216
Violence and vandalism

640
00:32:41,472 --> 00:32:43,264
Convoy protesters

641
00:32:45,056 --> 00:32:47,104
On the bridge that connects Detroit Michigan

642
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:48,640
The Windsor Ontario

643
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:53,248
28% of annual trade movement

644
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:54,528
For the u.s. and Canada

645
00:32:54,784 --> 00:32:55,296
She tweeted

646
00:32:55,552 --> 00:32:56,576
Slash the tires

647
00:32:58,112 --> 00:33:00,160
Drivers and move the trucks

648
00:33:00,928 --> 00:33:01,440
And in that order

649
00:33:03,488 --> 00:33:04,512
Dakine heli Pro

650
00:33:06,816 --> 00:33:07,584
Freedom

651
00:33:09,888 --> 00:33:10,912
Security issue now

652
00:33:13,728 --> 00:33:14,752
28%

653
00:33:20,384 --> 00:33:21,664
Cast

654
00:33:23,456 --> 00:33:24,736
The truck start over

655
00:33:27,552 --> 00:33:28,832
Drivers move the truck

656
00:33:31,904 --> 00:33:32,928
Cuz you don't know anything about

657
00:33:33,952 --> 00:33:36,000
Rashad run your ugly tile

658
00:33:36,768 --> 00:33:37,536
Delta sweetheart

659
00:33:37,792 --> 00:33:39,072
So weird why

660
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:40,864
It's so weird hats

661
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:43,680
I mean there's a misogyny in there sugar

662
00:33:43,936 --> 00:33:44,448
No no

663
00:33:44,704 --> 00:33:50,336
They seemed so hung up on the idea of the truck

664
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:55,200
Sure it seems to be how he's taking like the masculine High Ground

665
00:33:55,456 --> 00:33:57,760
Only a man would know how to move trucks

666
00:33:58,016 --> 00:34:02,112
Is kind of what I'm getting out of this not like it's wrong to slash the tires in

667
00:34:02,368 --> 00:34:08,512
Kind of his is larger position I think yeah there's also the sort of classic or the classes

668
00:34:08,768 --> 00:34:14,912
Chisholm aspect of it this Harvard person doesn't know about tires

669
00:34:15,168 --> 00:34:15,936
So stupid

670
00:34:17,216 --> 00:34:20,288
Everybody's response to the convoys

671
00:34:20,544 --> 00:34:26,688
Is somewhat stupid because we're only trained to deal with protesters the way protests are dealt with with

672
00:34:26,944 --> 00:34:27,968
Violence that is always

673
00:34:28,224 --> 00:34:28,736
F******

674
00:34:28,992 --> 00:34:30,528
Spray people with a hose

675
00:34:30,784 --> 00:34:31,808
With these idiots just

676
00:34:32,064 --> 00:34:37,184
Dress somebody up like Hillary Clinton with a big sign and milk Chaser out of the goddamn place

677
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:39,488
Kindergarten driveway they'll be like

678
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,352
I just had a great plan what's that

679
00:34:44,864 --> 00:34:51,008
Is CW McCall still alive

680
00:34:51,264 --> 00:34:52,544
How to get of God

681
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:55,104
Have him

682
00:34:55,360 --> 00:35:01,504
Just drive past college buddy rubber duck to get them to follow

683
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:07,904
This is not a violent situation this is an outsmart the Dum Dums come on Legends of Convoy

684
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:12,256
Viscira Stitch

685
00:35:12,512 --> 00:35:18,656
Maybe get to Burt Reynolds ultimate Heroes

686
00:35:18,912 --> 00:35:19,424
Remote problem

687
00:35:20,192 --> 00:35:26,336
If somebody just ran through Auto on Yelling that they wouldn't got to Smoke's coming

688
00:35:26,592 --> 00:35:31,456
Maybe it doesn't get everybody maybe some people are like this is a trick

689
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:34,016
But they're got there going to be a lot of people who go

690
00:35:34,272 --> 00:35:38,368
And you know it yeah you know it 90 in Dayton OH it's a numbers game

691
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:39,392
So

692
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:42,976
Alex bedtime

693
00:35:43,232 --> 00:35:44,000
Scott order of

694
00:35:44,256 --> 00:35:45,280
Slashing tires

695
00:35:45,536 --> 00:35:46,304
Moving truck

696
00:35:46,816 --> 00:35:50,912
And unfortunately that means that he did not have time to get to his actual point in that site

697
00:35:53,472 --> 00:35:53,984
I will

698
00:35:55,520 --> 00:35:57,824
Want to go out with you really got a big problem on their hands

699
00:35:59,104 --> 00:36:01,664
They needed to be able to have a Total Takeover by now

700
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:03,456
Spencer everybody plant down

701
00:36:06,784 --> 00:36:08,064
In the future when

702
00:36:10,112 --> 00:36:12,928
They can cover it up instead

703
00:36:18,048 --> 00:36:21,376
What is a right

704
00:36:21,632 --> 00:36:26,752
It's funny because he got too distracted by his confusing complaints

705
00:36:27,008 --> 00:36:28,288
About tires

706
00:36:28,544 --> 00:36:31,104
Here's the thing though Alex's Point makes no sense

707
00:36:31,616 --> 00:36:37,760
He's already said that the globalist have a plan B so because I listen to Alex and I remember what he said I know that if it

708
00:36:38,016 --> 00:36:40,320
Globalist plans are really as screwed as Alex's

709
00:36:40,576 --> 00:36:41,344
Pretending they are

710
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:47,744
Then they're just going to release a super bio weapon to kill everyone world that they would have preferred to have an orderly kill off

711
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,816
You can't always get what you want as I've learned from watching house

712
00:36:51,328 --> 00:36:53,888
Play play that song.

713
00:36:54,400 --> 00:37:00,032
I feel it I feel like ideas like this on the way Alex began to show talking about how it's time to shift into

714
00:37:00,288 --> 00:37:01,056
The prosecution

715
00:37:01,312 --> 00:37:01,824
Denotes

716
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:03,360
The B of A troubling possible

717
00:37:04,128 --> 00:37:06,176
I wouldn't be too surprised if the goal is to move

718
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:10,016
The town in two more calls for violence against these imaginary enemies

719
00:37:10,272 --> 00:37:12,320
And he'll use any deaths that end up happening

720
00:37:12,576 --> 00:37:13,344
If you will that call

721
00:37:14,112 --> 00:37:17,952
Obviously there isn't going to be a mass dying off but you've seen how folks like Alex

722
00:37:18,208 --> 00:37:19,232
Responded to celebrity deaths

723
00:37:19,488 --> 00:37:20,000
Recently

724
00:37:20,256 --> 00:37:23,584
Every elderly celebrity that dies must have been killed by the vaccines

725
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:27,936
Male trying to hijack whatever emotional connection you might have with the celebrity

726
00:37:28,192 --> 00:37:30,752
Android turn that into anger against the globalist

727
00:37:31,008 --> 00:37:31,520
For killing them

728
00:37:32,032 --> 00:37:34,592
I suspect that you're going to see a lot of Alex doing a lot of

729
00:37:36,384 --> 00:37:36,896
The

730
00:37:37,152 --> 00:37:38,176
The opening part

731
00:37:38,432 --> 00:37:40,736
With him saying that we weave

732
00:37:41,248 --> 00:37:44,064
Declared Victory now it's time for tribunals and all that s***

733
00:37:44,576 --> 00:37:45,344
Tumi

734
00:37:45,856 --> 00:37:47,904
Anytime these this kind of

735
00:37:48,672 --> 00:37:50,464
Conversation on the far right happens at like

736
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:52,000
Now it's time for trials

737
00:37:52,256 --> 00:37:58,400
That is a that's a week-long countdown to trials and never work at the office

738
00:37:58,912 --> 00:38:00,192
0 time

739
00:38:00,448 --> 00:38:01,728
It's a countdown to like

740
00:38:01,984 --> 00:38:03,520
We have realized that

741
00:38:04,032 --> 00:38:04,544
AR

742
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:05,824
It is absurd

743
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:10,688
Joel skousen is come around and reminded us that we only have conspiracy evidence right

744
00:38:10,944 --> 00:38:11,712
Things

745
00:38:11,968 --> 00:38:14,272
So we might as well get a shoot

746
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:15,808
Stupid

747
00:38:16,064 --> 00:38:16,576
It's troubling

748
00:38:17,088 --> 00:38:17,856
So Alex

749
00:38:18,112 --> 00:38:18,880
Decides

750
00:38:19,392 --> 00:38:20,160
Call an audible

Remove the Guess Who

756
00:38:32,704 --> 00:38:33,216
Suicide

Joining us and I want to talk

762
00:38:43,456 --> 00:38:44,736
The first round of callers

763
00:38:45,504 --> 00:38:47,296
Two truckers in Canada

764
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:51,136
And people there on the bridge are people there

765
00:38:51,648 --> 00:38:52,160
At the Capitol

766
00:38:54,208 --> 00:38:54,976
Australian

767
00:38:55,744 --> 00:38:59,328
Function France Belgium people in New Zealand it's the truckers

768
00:38:59,584 --> 00:39:00,608
Leading the fight here

769
00:39:00,864 --> 00:39:02,912
Hell yeah let's get some truckers on the line

770
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:04,704
Got to get some truckers on the line

00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:11,104
So we'll see we'll see if this pans out apologies to whoever you know plan to be on Alex's show getting your

00:39:14,688 --> 00:39:16,992
I guess I worked anybody

774
00:39:17,504 --> 00:39:20,064
So what are the things that Alex is really great at is

775
00:39:22,112 --> 00:39:22,880
He's always right

776
00:39:23,136 --> 00:39:23,904
He's never wrong

777
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:24,672
Because

778
00:39:24,928 --> 00:39:27,232
You just forget about the

779
00:39:27,488 --> 00:39:28,256
Thousands of predict

780
00:39:28,512 --> 00:39:29,280
He makes that he just

781
00:39:29,536 --> 00:39:32,608
Pretends he doesn't make he is psychic here's one that didn't come true

782
00:39:33,632 --> 00:39:34,144
Probably

783
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:39,008
The early morning hours I would say

784
00:39:39,776 --> 00:39:41,312
Saturday evening

785
00:39:41,568 --> 00:39:42,336
Sunday morning

786
00:39:43,616 --> 00:39:44,384
Divided yes

787
00:39:45,152 --> 00:39:46,432
DVD attack

788
00:39:46,688 --> 00:39:48,480
As well

789
00:39:49,248 --> 00:39:52,320
Imaginal Car Bomb small car bomb

790
00:39:57,952 --> 00:39:58,720
Too much for their cop

791
00:40:00,256 --> 00:40:01,280
Police are going to

792
00:40:01,536 --> 00:40:02,304
Get it car bomb

793
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:03,072
Or something

794
00:40:03,328 --> 00:40:04,096
And

795
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:09,984
Course I mean I do it because I just

796
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:12,288
What I would do

797
00:40:12,544 --> 00:40:13,056
That's what I do

798
00:40:17,408 --> 00:40:17,920
Operation

799
00:40:18,432 --> 00:40:18,944
Call flag

800
00:40:19,712 --> 00:40:22,016
Okay okay

801
00:40:24,832 --> 00:40:28,416
What is on Sundays

802
00:40:28,672 --> 00:40:29,696
Well I mean the the cop

803
00:40:29,952 --> 00:40:30,464
Ask them

804
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:31,488
Politely to go

805
00:40:31,744 --> 00:40:33,280
And then most of them went

806
00:40:35,584 --> 00:40:38,656
Yeah and that didn't clear things out now early now

807
00:40:39,168 --> 00:40:41,472
No false flag car bomb

808
00:40:41,728 --> 00:40:47,872
No I do like how he's insulting Canada like you guys couldn't pull off Oklahoma City

809
00:40:48,128 --> 00:40:50,176
Bomb daycares are cowards

810
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:59,648
Cano globalist arm or whatever

811
00:40:59,904 --> 00:41:05,280
Do they pull up Oklahoma City that's big-time.

812
00:41:05,536 --> 00:41:08,608
Look if you want to turn Ottowa into the

813
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:10,912
Northern Ireland border

814
00:41:11,168 --> 00:41:13,216
Circa teams 95

815
00:41:13,472 --> 00:41:13,984
Bye

816
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:15,008
Fly

817
00:41:16,544 --> 00:41:17,312
But you don't have the guts

818
00:41:17,568 --> 00:41:18,080
Did you okay

819
00:41:18,336 --> 00:41:19,360
Casey

820
00:41:19,872 --> 00:41:20,896
That's

821
00:41:21,152 --> 00:41:21,920
The frame

822
00:41:22,432 --> 00:41:23,712
So Alex Goes break

823
00:41:23,968 --> 00:41:24,480
Comes back

824
00:41:24,736 --> 00:41:27,552
And we got a special report from John bowne

825
00:41:27,808 --> 00:41:29,344
We're not going to listen to much of it but that

826
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:31,136
Just the beginning of it caught my ear and I was like

827
00:41:31,392 --> 00:41:32,160
F*** you man

828
00:41:39,328 --> 00:41:40,864
Tool of the cult of the left

829
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:43,680
What kind of rice the song called

830
00:41:43,936 --> 00:41:44,704
Keep On Rocking

831
00:41:45,216 --> 00:41:45,984
The Free World

832
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:47,264
And proceeds to be

833
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:48,288
Dell'Osso

834
00:41:48,544 --> 00:41:50,336
Of the song

835
00:41:50,592 --> 00:41:52,384
Hey John that song a little tongue

836
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:53,151
Antique

837
00:41:55,711 --> 00:41:56,479
Wow man

838
00:41:57,759 --> 00:42:02,623
Abandons her child on the streets to go get drugs

839
00:42:03,135 --> 00:42:04,927
She hates her life and what you

840
00:42:05,183 --> 00:42:05,695
She's done to it

841
00:42:06,207 --> 00:42:11,071
There's one more kid that'll never go to school never get to fall in love never get to be cool

842
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:12,863
Yeah keep on rocking

843
00:42:14,911 --> 00:42:16,703
I'm starting to get the feeling

844
00:42:16,959 --> 00:42:17,471
That

845
00:42:17,727 --> 00:42:19,263
For most of the things that

846
00:42:19,519 --> 00:42:22,335
It's conservatives get very very angry about they have not been

847
00:42:22,591 --> 00:42:23,359
Close reading on

848
00:42:23,615 --> 00:42:28,223
Was almost like John bowne is responding to this song b title like Alex

849
00:42:28,479 --> 00:42:30,527
But it's particles in the headlines

850
00:42:30,783 --> 00:42:31,551
Is it really is

851
00:42:31,807 --> 00:42:33,343
Is focus there

852
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:36,415
Just like how born in the u.s.a. is about how great it is

853
00:42:36,671 --> 00:42:37,951
It's to be born in the u.s.a.

854
00:42:38,207 --> 00:42:38,975
That's what it's about

855
00:42:39,231 --> 00:42:39,999
Cuz it's the title

856
00:42:40,255 --> 00:42:44,863
I would guess that there is somewhere a John bowne report about

857
00:42:45,375 --> 00:42:48,959
Yeah about spring green sprout in the USA

858
00:42:49,215 --> 00:42:55,359
Springsteen was a target of influence for a little while commercial

859
00:42:57,151 --> 00:43:03,295
My God what is wrong when it's Super Bowl commercial

860
00:43:03,551 --> 00:43:05,343
I'm sure John Brown did a video and he's like

861
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:08,159
How could somebody who made bored in the USA

862
00:43:09,695 --> 00:43:12,767
How Could You Raul Garcia

863
00:43:14,047 --> 00:43:16,607
So Alex has got some more news

864
00:43:16,863 --> 00:43:19,423
He's he's pretty worried about

865
00:43:20,191 --> 00:43:20,703
I have

866
00:43:20,959 --> 00:43:22,495
Chance to read

867
00:43:22,751 --> 00:43:25,567
The emergency by the

868
00:43:25,823 --> 00:43:26,335
Globalist

869
00:43:26,591 --> 00:43:27,871
New World Order alumnus

870
00:43:28,383 --> 00:43:30,431
I'm Klaus Schwab over the state

871
00:43:31,455 --> 00:43:34,527
Province of Ontario Canada that Auto with the capital Geographic

872
00:43:36,063 --> 00:43:36,831
Martial law

873
00:43:37,855 --> 00:43:40,415
Hundred-thousand-dollar sign a year in prison

874
00:43:42,207 --> 00:43:43,487
And the way it's sold

875
00:43:43,743 --> 00:43:45,791
Is all of you block a bridge but actually says

876
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:49,631
Then ambulance might be trying to go down

877
00:43:52,703 --> 00:43:53,471
You're going to go to jail

878
00:43:53,727 --> 00:43:57,055
Even if everything Alex were saying we're truth that's not martial law

879
00:43:57,823 --> 00:43:58,591
But you look very

880
00:44:00,127 --> 00:44:05,247
Why is that right rollers like

881
00:44:05,759 --> 00:44:08,575
The left block the road you can hit him with your car

882
00:44:09,343 --> 00:44:12,159
He was pretty into that yeah

883
00:44:12,415 --> 00:44:17,023
Yep he's not really all that important that I agree with your sentiment

884
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:20,351
But this isn't Marshall Auto matter what

885
00:44:20,607 --> 00:44:24,703
Might be like a tight clampdown on protesters but it doesn't even come close

886
00:44:24,959 --> 00:44:25,727
The definition of Martha

887
00:44:25,983 --> 00:44:26,495
Martial law

888
00:44:26,751 --> 00:44:28,287
For Alex in the audience

889
00:44:28,543 --> 00:44:30,079
Because it Infowars land

890
00:44:30,335 --> 00:44:32,639
Martial law is a term that describes a Feeling

891
00:44:33,151 --> 00:44:36,223
Is a feeling of whenever government does something you don't like

892
00:44:36,479 --> 00:44:39,807
I don't feel like I can do whatever I want right now and probably

893
00:44:40,063 --> 00:44:41,087
The government declared

894
00:44:42,367 --> 00:44:44,415
They're going on here

895
00:44:44,671 --> 00:44:47,231
The first is that Ottawa mayor Jim Watson

896
00:44:47,487 --> 00:44:49,023
Declared a state of emergency

897
00:44:49,279 --> 00:44:50,559
Conceived in the city on February

898
00:44:51,327 --> 00:44:53,887
Then on Friday the 11th Ontario Premier Doug

899
00:44:54,143 --> 00:44:55,679
Ford also declared a state of emergency

900
00:44:56,191 --> 00:44:56,703
The province

901
00:44:56,959 --> 00:44:59,263
Because we were setting up the blockades at the border crossing

902
00:44:59,519 --> 00:45:00,543
Things that are outside Ottawa

903
00:45:01,311 --> 00:45:03,103
Alex didn't read any statement or merge

904
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:06,943
Regency order pretty probably watch Doug Ford short speech race of this

905
00:45:07,455 --> 00:45:07,967
Quote

906
00:45:08,223 --> 00:45:11,807
Today I'm using my authority as premier of Ontario to declare a state of emergency

907
00:45:12,063 --> 00:45:13,343
And our Province and I will

908
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:17,439
Convene cabinets to use legal authorities to urgently and orders

909
00:45:17,695 --> 00:45:21,535
That will make crystal clear it is illegal and punishable to block and impede the movements

910
00:45:21,791 --> 00:45:22,559
Good's people

911
00:45:22,815 --> 00:45:23,583
And services

912
00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:24,607
Along critical in

913
00:45:24,863 --> 00:45:25,375
Infrastructure

914
00:45:25,887 --> 00:45:28,191
This will include protecting international border crossings

915
00:45:28,447 --> 00:45:29,727
400 series highways

916
00:45:29,983 --> 00:45:30,495
Airports

917
00:45:30,751 --> 00:45:31,775
Porto Airport

918
00:45:32,031 --> 00:45:33,823
Sports Bridges and railways

919
00:45:34,335 --> 00:45:38,687
It will also include protecting the safe movement of ambulatory and Medical Services

920
00:45:38,943 --> 00:45:40,991
Public transit Municipal and provincial

921
00:45:42,271 --> 00:45:43,807
As well as pedestrian walkways

922
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:49,695
Fines for non-compliance will be severe with a maximum penalty of $100,000 and up to a year in prison

923
00:45:49,951 --> 00:45:53,535
Will also provide additional authority to consider taking away personal

924
00:45:53,791 --> 00:45:56,351
And Commercial licenses of anyone who doesn't comply with these order

925
00:45:57,631 --> 00:45:59,167
So this is a temporary

926
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:00,191
I order

927
00:46:00,447 --> 00:46:03,519
But also I don't I don't do without interpretation but I

928
00:46:03,775 --> 00:46:05,311
Don't say I think this is a bad idea

929
00:46:06,335 --> 00:46:08,127
I I don't agree with this this

930
00:46:08,383 --> 00:46:08,895
This move

931
00:46:09,151 --> 00:46:11,711
Cuz you don't really need to have any further laws

932
00:46:13,503 --> 00:46:16,319
It's illegal to block traffic already

933
00:46:16,575 --> 00:46:17,087
Yeah

934
00:46:18,367 --> 00:46:18,879
Please get a ticket

935
00:46:19,135 --> 00:46:25,279
No no no it's important to do this now so whenever somebody who is

936
00:46:25,535 --> 00:46:28,607
Non-white a person of color does something like this

937
00:46:28,863 --> 00:46:31,423
You can put them in jail for a year and find them $100,000

938
00:46:31,935 --> 00:46:32,447
I think

939
00:46:32,703 --> 00:46:34,239
And then the Ottawa Convoy will

940
00:46:34,495 --> 00:46:36,799
Get along very nicely I think you run the race

941
00:46:38,591 --> 00:46:41,407
That potential of being president

942
00:46:41,663 --> 00:46:43,967
It's used against other protesters

943
00:46:44,223 --> 00:46:45,503
Always work tonight

944
00:46:45,759 --> 00:46:50,367
I think that it's unnecessary. We don't have a problem of lack of laws

945
00:46:50,623 --> 00:46:51,391
I have a problem of

946
00:46:51,647 --> 00:46:53,695
This isn't being a

947
00:46:53,951 --> 00:47:00,095
Or just like you go for too long and now it's too big of a problem for you to handle

948
00:47:00,351 --> 00:47:04,703
Understand that I'm in control of the government

949
00:47:05,215 --> 00:47:06,495
A bunch of idiots

950
00:47:06,751 --> 00:47:10,591
Block the Convoy and there's just nothing we can do what are we supposed to do

951
00:47:13,663 --> 00:47:14,175
I don't know

952
00:47:14,943 --> 00:47:17,503
So Alex I'm going to skip this clip cuz it just Alex

953
00:47:17,759 --> 00:47:19,295
Suggesting that the

954
00:47:20,063 --> 00:47:22,623
The protest should shift to being about

955
00:47:23,135 --> 00:47:23,647
Trying

956
00:47:23,903 --> 00:47:29,023
Klaus Schwab and of course executing him

957
00:47:29,279 --> 00:47:31,583
I can I can imagine

958
00:47:32,095 --> 00:47:35,679
Big swing for a pro for a single protest to do

959
00:47:35,935 --> 00:47:37,215
Definitely and ice

960
00:47:37,727 --> 00:47:43,871
Again this this exacerbates the problem of there being really no coherent through line but about what this is about

961
00:47:44,383 --> 00:47:46,175
Yeah

962
00:47:46,687 --> 00:47:50,783
Murder the head of the world economic forum is this really the right

963
00:47:51,039 --> 00:47:53,087
Place 2B rabble-rousing

964
00:47:54,111 --> 00:47:55,135
Attack Clash Royale

965
00:47:55,903 --> 00:47:58,207
You know what I'm saying like where is cloth swab

966
00:47:58,719 --> 00:47:59,231
Currently

967
00:48:00,255 --> 00:48:01,023
Probably

968
00:48:01,279 --> 00:48:03,583
Probably somewhere in Europe

969
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:05,887
And he's usually in Europe

970
00:48:07,423 --> 00:48:07,935
So

971
00:48:08,447 --> 00:48:09,215
I don't

972
00:48:10,239 --> 00:48:10,751
I could be wrong

973
00:48:11,007 --> 00:48:13,055
But I don't think a few hundred people

974
00:48:13,311 --> 00:48:16,127
Causing problems at the border of Ottawa in the United States

975
00:48:16,383 --> 00:48:19,455
Are really going to have a big effect on how Europe feels about

976
00:48:19,967 --> 00:48:21,247
Malenkov swabs

977
00:48:22,015 --> 00:48:22,527
Bodied

978
00:48:23,039 --> 00:48:24,319
What if

979
00:48:24,831 --> 00:48:30,463
The auto manufacturers get really desperate have to kidnap Cloud swab

980
00:48:30,719 --> 00:48:32,511
General Motors

981
00:48:33,791 --> 00:48:36,351
General Motors

982
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:40,959
Mujica is anyone could go in and get you a foul odor

983
00:48:41,215 --> 00:48:44,287
He's got the the fighting force behind them

984
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:46,591
Vets

985
00:48:49,151 --> 00:48:51,967
It's it is the exact audience you would want to sell

986
00:48:52,223 --> 00:48:53,503
This to the vets

987
00:48:53,759 --> 00:48:55,551
It seems like these folks have

988
00:48:56,319 --> 00:48:57,855
They're they're all

989
00:48:58,111 --> 00:48:58,879
Onboard

990
00:48:59,135 --> 00:49:02,207
Great reset nonsense totally

991
00:49:02,463 --> 00:49:05,023
Today are the kind of people you could get to actually like

992
00:49:05,279 --> 00:49:08,607
Cheer let's get Chihuahua

993
00:49:08,863 --> 00:49:14,239
Everybody's embraced absurdity to the point where yeah why not have a bunch of people in ottawa's chanting kill

994
00:49:14,495 --> 00:49:15,007
Clothes swap

995
00:49:16,799 --> 00:49:21,407
So Alex is going to take some calls and he's called for the truck

996
00:49:21,663 --> 00:49:22,431
Her folks to call in

997
00:49:22,943 --> 00:49:24,479
There's a little bit of a problem

998
00:49:24,735 --> 00:49:26,015
It matters too many non Truckers

999
00:49:26,527 --> 00:49:32,671
I'm not trying to be mean here in the letters I love you to death

1000
00:49:32,927 --> 00:49:35,231
I normally all the phones up it's just a free-for-all

1001
00:49:35,487 --> 00:49:37,535
But when I specifically

1002
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:39,583
Want to

1003
00:49:40,095 --> 00:49:41,887
People

1004
00:49:42,655 --> 00:49:44,447
Geographic area or particular

1005
00:49:44,959 --> 00:49:46,751
Group are on the ground sing something

1006
00:49:47,263 --> 00:49:49,311
We need everybody not to be calling in

1007
00:49:50,591 --> 00:49:51,871
Because the call screener

1008
00:49:52,895 --> 00:49:53,919
Call

1009
00:49:59,295 --> 00:50:00,319
When I want it on a

1010
00:50:00,575 --> 00:50:01,087
Particular topic

1011
00:50:03,647 --> 00:50:05,951
And we're unable to get Truckers

1012
00:50:06,207 --> 00:50:06,975
To get through

1013
00:50:07,487 --> 00:50:10,559
Because the phone lines are all maxed out

1014
00:50:10,815 --> 00:50:13,119
With people that are not

1015
00:50:13,375 --> 00:50:13,887
In Canada

1016
00:50:14,655 --> 00:50:15,935
Or truckers in the US

1017
00:50:16,191 --> 00:50:16,959
Australia

1018
00:50:17,215 --> 00:50:18,495
Truckers. That are

1019
00:50:18,751 --> 00:50:21,055
Part of this or your view on it

1020
00:50:21,567 --> 00:50:23,871
And I want to get your take on the situation because

1021
00:50:25,151 --> 00:50:31,295
Hey Doug Ford

1022
00:50:31,551 --> 00:50:32,319
I believe it is like

1023
00:50:32,575 --> 00:50:36,671
Thousands of call Lyons now

1024
00:50:36,927 --> 00:50:38,719
The board's babies at the scale back

1025
00:50:39,231 --> 00:50:44,607
But yeah your response that is very similar to my nose like the sounds like nobody called in

1026
00:50:44,863 --> 00:50:46,143
Nobody from the Convoy is called

1027
00:50:46,399 --> 00:50:51,263
I felt that way he doesn't getting couple self-identified Truckers

1028
00:50:51,775 --> 00:50:53,055
One of them was there

1029
00:50:53,311 --> 00:50:58,175
One of them was there but then he had to leave cuz he had to work

1030
00:50:58,431 --> 00:51:01,247
He's like going back and forth like doing s***

1031
00:51:03,039 --> 00:51:03,807
That guy seemed

1032
00:51:04,063 --> 00:51:04,831
Cool

1033
00:51:05,343 --> 00:51:07,903
I don't remember anything about him actually foot

1034
00:51:08,415 --> 00:51:10,975
Alex has two calls that he has to get to

1035
00:51:11,487 --> 00:51:14,815
That's because they were on the line with the show ended yes

1036
00:51:15,583 --> 00:51:20,447
Alex took their number and he's called them back okay I was assuming they were still on the line

1037
00:51:20,703 --> 00:51:23,263
I wouldn't I wouldn't be surprised some of these weirdos

1038
00:51:23,775 --> 00:51:27,103
So here's the first one this guy's got it this was worth calling back in about

1039
00:51:34,527 --> 00:51:35,807
Something everybody can do

1040
00:51:38,367 --> 00:51:38,879
Active

1041
00:51:39,135 --> 00:51:43,231
Rusty wife

1042
00:51:50,143 --> 00:51:53,727
Glad you called elaborate on this yes

1043
00:51:53,983 --> 00:51:56,799
Now is the time in your small town or your big city

1044
00:51:57,311 --> 00:51:59,871
Put on the bathroom wall

1045
00:52:03,455 --> 00:52:05,247
How to put a sticker on your car

1046
00:52:05,503 --> 00:52:07,807
Banner hangs over Highway

1047
00:52:08,319 --> 00:52:10,879
And it will be a chain-reaction beautifully said

1048
00:52:17,023 --> 00:52:19,839
How fun is this

1049
00:52:20,095 --> 00:52:20,607
It's good marker

1050
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:23,679
Here's the thing I love first

1051
00:52:23,935 --> 00:52:25,983
Not a fresh idea

1052
00:52:26,239 --> 00:52:28,799
Instant pudding banners over the highway

1053
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:30,591
I mean

1054
00:52:31,103 --> 00:52:34,687
I mean I've seen people put Styrofoam cups in the fences but that

1055
00:52:34,943 --> 00:52:38,015
That's minor leagues to another level

1056
00:52:38,271 --> 00:52:42,111
This is not not to setting the World on Fire Within

1057
00:52:42,367 --> 00:52:44,415
Also this is something to tempt

1058
00:52:44,671 --> 00:52:49,791
To get out of hand and people end up putting really offensive should almost liners

1059
00:52:50,559 --> 00:52:56,703
My love

1060
00:52:56,959 --> 00:52:58,495
Is it to bathroom graffiti

1061
00:52:58,751 --> 00:53:01,567
He was really willing to start from the bottom

1062
00:53:01,823 --> 00:53:07,967
He was like you know what I don't know if we're ready for bed or is he a good time go to ban Todd video

1063
00:53:08,223 --> 00:53:10,015
Even have a message to put on a banner

1064
00:53:10,271 --> 00:53:11,295
That's expensive

1065
00:53:11,551 --> 00:53:12,575
Get yourself a Sharpie

1066
00:53:13,087 --> 00:53:13,599
Practice

1067
00:53:13,855 --> 00:53:15,391
Bathroom

1068
00:53:15,647 --> 00:53:17,183
Refine your message

1069
00:53:17,439 --> 00:53:23,583
The first few are going to be good they're not going to have it in there probably can be too long I absolutely

1070
00:53:26,143 --> 00:53:31,263
Your timing right here you want to come back and make sure people haven't giving you notes

1071
00:53:31,519 --> 00:53:35,359
Who's walking around with the red Barker giving you little paragraph breaks

1072
00:53:36,127 --> 00:53:41,247
So this color is Alex's pretty excited about easy enjoy this discussion of

1073
00:53:42,015 --> 00:53:43,295
Obviously free promotion

1074
00:53:43,551 --> 00:53:45,599
Convert about everything

1075
00:53:45,855 --> 00:53:48,159
That's what we learned at something that we have

1076
00:53:48,671 --> 00:53:49,439
Been tracking

1077
00:53:49,695 --> 00:53:50,719
For the better part of

1078
00:53:50,975 --> 00:53:51,743
3 years

1079
00:53:52,255 --> 00:53:53,791
He's finally about to happen

1080
00:53:54,303 --> 00:53:58,143
Brother that's why I love taking calls why should take more calls on my very soon we're going to start

1081
00:53:58,655 --> 00:54:01,983
At least two nights a week and once on the weekend on top of the Sunday show

1082
00:54:02,495 --> 00:54:03,775
A commercial-free

1083
00:54:04,031 --> 00:54:05,567
Podcast that's live

1084
00:54:06,079 --> 00:54:09,151
So everybody can call and we'll just hear from all of you amazing people

1085
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:10,431
God bless you Chris

1086
00:54:10,943 --> 00:54:14,783
Finally going to get that caller show telling you I'm telling you right now

1087
00:54:15,807 --> 00:54:16,831
I don't think it's going to have

1088
00:54:17,343 --> 00:54:22,975
Well if past is Prelude we're going to hear about how it's about to start about six months

1089
00:54:23,231 --> 00:54:27,583
The week at any moment to start a live podcast

1090
00:54:28,351 --> 00:54:28,863
Where people can

1091
00:54:29,119 --> 00:54:29,887
Can call it

1092
00:54:30,655 --> 00:54:33,215
Can't wait anymore

1093
00:54:33,471 --> 00:54:35,519
So Alex believes that

1094
00:54:36,031 --> 00:54:37,311
Everyone thinks he's a hero

1095
00:54:37,567 --> 00:54:38,335
Bright because

1096
00:54:38,591 --> 00:54:39,359
Keith standing

1097
00:54:39,615 --> 00:54:41,151
For the people who are standing up

1098
00:54:41,663 --> 00:54:42,175
In Canada

1099
00:54:42,431 --> 00:54:44,479
He's standing with the people who are against

1100
00:54:44,735 --> 00:54:47,551
Fauci in the vaccines and what have you all over the world

1101
00:54:47,807 --> 00:54:48,831
But he's not a hero

1102
00:54:49,343 --> 00:54:49,855
No

1103
00:54:50,111 --> 00:54:51,135
Robin obviously

1104
00:54:52,415 --> 00:54:53,951
Is saying that he's not a hero

1105
00:54:54,207 --> 00:54:55,487
Oh okay

1106
00:54:55,999 --> 00:54:58,047
See if you can track this cuz this is like

1107
00:54:58,303 --> 00:55:00,351
I found this to be incredibly convoluted

1108
00:55:14,431 --> 00:55:15,967
Wow you're so nice you care about us

1109
00:55:18,783 --> 00:55:21,599
Car swap with your country

1110
00:55:26,463 --> 00:55:28,255
I'm not doing this cuz I'm a hero

1111
00:55:28,511 --> 00:55:29,535
I'm not doing this

1112
00:55:32,095 --> 00:55:33,375
Call the self-preservation

1113
00:55:40,031 --> 00:55:41,055
Going to put me out

1114
00:55:42,335 --> 00:55:42,847
Okay

1115
00:55:43,103 --> 00:55:47,967
Self-preservation

1116
00:55:48,223 --> 00:55:50,015
Like if a takedown Canada Texas is Max

1117
00:55:50,271 --> 00:55:55,391
Right obviously this is just a preamble for a sales pitch and it does end up coming immediately after this

1118
00:55:55,903 --> 00:55:56,927
But it's also Justin consist

1119
00:55:57,695 --> 00:56:02,303
Alex compares the situation to how he would put out someone who was on fire because that's what he

1120
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:03,839
He would want someone to do for him

1121
00:56:04,095 --> 00:56:07,679
Which is a completely different motivation than cellpro self-preservation

1122
00:56:08,447 --> 00:56:12,799
Putting someone else because you would want them to put you out if you were on fire is actually pretty

1123
00:56:14,335 --> 00:56:15,359
Fairly heroic Act

1124
00:56:15,871 --> 00:56:18,431
You might want to impugn your own motives and say your act

1125
00:56:18,687 --> 00:56:19,199
Unselfishly

1126
00:56:19,455 --> 00:56:25,087
Cuz you think you'll get something out of it but you're saving someone solely because you believe people should help each other

1127
00:56:25,599 --> 00:56:30,975
Backflip legitimately would only make sense if Alex was saying that he would put someone out because

1128
00:56:31,487 --> 00:56:33,791
You know he was afraid that they might catch him on fire

1129
00:56:34,047 --> 00:56:36,351
Preservation

1130
00:56:36,863 --> 00:56:38,399
As it stands is just a muddled mess

1131
00:56:39,167 --> 00:56:40,703
I'm back with that is meaning

1132
00:56:40,959 --> 00:56:42,495
Yeah yeah I mean

1133
00:56:43,007 --> 00:56:45,567
In Alex's World though any kind of

1134
00:56:45,823 --> 00:56:46,335
Sting

1135
00:56:46,591 --> 00:56:47,871
Could happen to somebody else

1136
00:56:48,127 --> 00:56:48,639
Somebody is

1137
00:56:48,895 --> 00:56:49,407
Planning

1138
00:56:49,663 --> 00:56:50,431
To make happen

1139
00:56:50,943 --> 00:56:51,455
You know

1140
00:56:51,711 --> 00:56:56,063
Like vids somebody just in the abstract being lit on fire

1141
00:56:57,343 --> 00:56:59,647
Has this moment immediately afterwards like

1142
00:56:59,903 --> 00:57:01,695
And the globalist want to light me on fire horse

1143
00:57:01,951 --> 00:57:02,975
Exactly like that

1144
00:57:03,231 --> 00:57:06,815
So I'm going to save that guy because what if the globalist light me on fire which they're going to do

1145
00:57:07,071 --> 00:57:09,887
My feeling about it is more than he's like

1146
00:57:10,399 --> 00:57:10,911
Alright

1147
00:57:11,679 --> 00:57:12,703
I do think I'm a hero

1148
00:57:12,959 --> 00:57:16,031
Got to make sure that people don't think I think I'm a hero cuz this is

1149
00:57:16,287 --> 00:57:19,871
Leading to a sales pitch all I'm trying to say I was going to do what Heroes do

1150
00:57:20,127 --> 00:57:23,967
I'm going to say some incoherent inconsistent s*** about how I'm not here okay

1151
00:57:24,223 --> 00:57:28,063
It's self-preservation and also I would want someone to put me out if I was on fire

1152
00:57:28,831 --> 00:57:29,343
Alright

1153
00:57:29,599 --> 00:57:30,111
Give me money

1154
00:57:30,367 --> 00:57:31,647
So look

1155
00:57:31,903 --> 00:57:33,695
I think that the language

1156
00:57:34,207 --> 00:57:34,719
Is shifting

1157
00:57:36,767 --> 00:57:38,559
On this episode

1158
00:57:39,071 --> 00:57:41,375
I sent this a little bit

1159
00:57:41,631 --> 00:57:44,191
More there is a strain of

1160
00:57:44,703 --> 00:57:45,727
We have one

1161
00:57:45,983 --> 00:57:47,519
And now it is time for Venge

1162
00:57:47,775 --> 00:57:49,567
Right and that is trouble

1163
00:57:50,079 --> 00:57:53,151
Beautifully said but I want to be clear they started this war

1164
00:57:55,455 --> 00:57:58,015
Cost Millions to commit suicide or died drug overdose

1165
00:57:58,271 --> 00:57:59,807
What are peacefully doing this

1166
00:58:00,063 --> 00:58:02,367
False flag

1167
00:58:02,879 --> 00:58:03,903
We know we didn't do it

1168
00:58:04,159 --> 00:58:06,975
We're not apologizing for whatever happen

1169
00:58:07,487 --> 00:58:08,511
Cuz they started this

1170
00:58:08,767 --> 00:58:10,815
Apologies

1171
00:58:11,071 --> 00:58:11,839
Not by me

1172
00:58:13,119 --> 00:58:15,679
I know buddy I pledged to you no more apologies

1173
00:58:16,191 --> 00:58:16,703
Nope

1174
00:58:16,959 --> 00:58:17,983
I'm with your brother

1175
00:58:18,239 --> 00:58:19,519
That's troubling

1176
00:58:19,775 --> 00:58:20,543
No more Impala

1177
00:58:21,311 --> 00:58:22,591
No more apologies

1178
00:58:22,847 --> 00:58:28,735
And they started it right this imaginary villain cabal that Alex is up again

1179
00:58:29,503 --> 00:58:33,087
Committed all these horrific

1180
00:58:33,343 --> 00:58:36,927
Obvious war crimes crimes against humanity against us

1181
00:58:37,439 --> 00:58:38,975
Hey man if you know

1182
00:58:39,231 --> 00:58:42,559
They get attacked or something it's a false flag so we know we did

1183
00:58:42,815 --> 00:58:46,911
Do it so we have the moral Authority no matter what happens we will not apologize

1184
00:58:47,167 --> 00:58:47,935
This is all just

1185
00:58:48,191 --> 00:58:48,703
Very

1186
00:58:48,959 --> 00:58:51,519
I mean it's it's kind of stuff that could be taken

1187
00:58:52,287 --> 00:58:54,591
In a particular way I mean

1188
00:58:54,847 --> 00:58:55,615
It seems odd

1189
00:58:55,871 --> 00:58:57,151
Considering his earlier comments

1190
00:58:57,663 --> 00:58:58,175
Suggest that

1191
00:58:58,431 --> 00:59:02,783
He obviously would like people to apologize to him when they are in the wrong so it

1192
00:59:03,039 --> 00:59:03,551
Teams

1193
00:59:03,807 --> 00:59:09,951
Only reasonable that he would apologize to other people when he's in the wrong no more apologies well then I don't think he's

1194
00:59:10,207 --> 00:59:12,255
Title to any apologies any further

1195
00:59:13,279 --> 00:59:17,119
Might be influenced by Rogan

1196
00:59:17,375 --> 00:59:18,399
Bob putting out there

1197
00:59:18,655 --> 00:59:23,263
All the time

1198
00:59:23,519 --> 00:59:27,359
Yeah I think I might be having a tough time with that

1199
00:59:28,639 --> 00:59:30,175
The way he's dealing with it

1200
00:59:30,431 --> 00:59:36,575
Some people might have seen that been a little bit disillusioned maybe some people have been disappointed in jail

1201
00:59:37,599 --> 00:59:38,367
Alex

1202
00:59:38,879 --> 00:59:39,903
Seems to want

1203
00:59:40,159 --> 00:59:41,439
Do some counterproductive

1204
00:59:41,695 --> 00:59:42,719
ER for Rogan

1205
00:59:42,975 --> 00:59:49,119
You know how great it is aroga says the n-word all the time

1206
00:59:49,631 --> 00:59:50,655
JoJo came out

1207
00:59:51,167 --> 00:59:52,191
A Secret show

1208
00:59:52,447 --> 00:59:52,959
Sunday night

1209
00:59:56,799 --> 00:59:57,311
The secret

1210
00:59:57,567 --> 00:59:58,079
Comedy show

1211
00:59:58,591 --> 00:59:59,615
He did another one

1212
01:00:04,479 --> 01:00:06,527
He said I am not to apologize

1213
01:00:08,319 --> 01:00:10,111
Was taken off the air just as her jealous

1214
01:00:12,671 --> 01:00:15,743
Because if you watch that attitude

1215
01:00:21,631 --> 01:00:24,191
That is not an apology that is a clarification

1216
01:00:25,215 --> 01:00:25,727
D'usse

1217
01:00:31,615 --> 01:00:33,663
I'm sorry if you're legitimately your feelings are

1218
01:00:34,431 --> 01:00:36,223
Cuz if you do watch it it's a little

1219
01:00:36,735 --> 01:00:38,783
3 minutes of the n-word over and over again

1220
01:00:39,295 --> 01:00:40,063
Yes

1221
01:00:40,575 --> 01:00:41,599
That is exorbitant

1222
01:00:41,855 --> 01:00:42,367
Class of people

1223
01:00:42,623 --> 01:00:44,671
Alex doesn't like words that hurt a class of people

1224
01:00:45,951 --> 01:00:47,487
I mean

1225
01:00:47,743 --> 01:00:51,583
Blurt laughed at that when I was little

1226
01:00:51,839 --> 01:00:54,911
Words that hurt a class of people

1227
01:00:55,167 --> 01:00:58,239
A large grouping of people with a certain

1228
01:00:58,495 --> 01:01:04,383
Let me tell you identify and characteristics if I if I made Supercut

1229
01:01:04,639 --> 01:01:10,783
The times that Alex's used words that are meant to her classes of people to be a lot longer than 3 minutes

1230
01:01:11,807 --> 01:01:13,855
Weird I mean

1231
01:01:14,111 --> 01:01:15,135
Just leaving aside the fact

1232
01:01:15,391 --> 01:01:17,183
Joe is absolutely apologizing

1233
01:01:17,439 --> 01:01:22,303
Whether or not it was a good apology or not is another question

1234
01:01:22,559 --> 01:01:24,095
But if it was a little long

1235
01:01:24,351 --> 01:01:27,679
I mean the way Alex characterized it he is right that is not an apology

1236
01:01:27,935 --> 01:01:31,007
To say I am sorry if you were offended by something I said

1237
01:01:31,263 --> 01:01:31,775
That is

1238
01:01:32,287 --> 01:01:33,055
You made a

1239
01:01:33,311 --> 01:01:34,079
You made a mistake

1240
01:01:34,335 --> 01:01:35,103
No I'm not

1241
01:01:35,359 --> 01:01:36,127
I'm happy

1242
01:01:36,383 --> 01:01:42,271
I am not here to decide whether or not his apology was sufficient to her or

1243
01:01:42,527 --> 01:01:43,295
Heartfelt

1244
01:01:44,575 --> 01:01:45,087
Not

1245
01:01:45,343 --> 01:01:46,623
Decision

1246
01:01:46,879 --> 01:01:47,391
Here to make

1247
01:01:48,159 --> 01:01:48,927
He did

1248
01:01:49,183 --> 01:01:50,207
Express that

1249
01:01:50,463 --> 01:01:55,583
This word was something that I didn't realize how inappropriate it was for me to say

1250
01:01:55,839 --> 01:01:57,631
In the context that I set it in

1251
01:01:57,887 --> 01:01:58,399
I was at

1252
01:01:58,655 --> 01:01:59,935
Talking to my friends talking about rich

1253
01:02:00,191 --> 01:02:00,959
Pryor albums

1254
01:02:01,215 --> 01:02:04,543
Or whatever and then being like I now realize

1255
01:02:04,799 --> 01:02:09,663
That that is absolutely not okay in context or out of contact

1256
01:02:09,919 --> 01:02:10,943
Not okay at all

1257
01:02:11,455 --> 01:02:13,759
Has understanding then and I do now

1258
01:02:15,039 --> 01:02:16,319
It is an apology

1259
01:02:16,575 --> 01:02:18,879
Whether or not it's good cuz there's also some

1260
01:02:19,135 --> 01:02:22,463
Problems with a little bit of dumbness

1261
01:02:22,719 --> 01:02:23,743
No Doubt

1262
01:02:23,999 --> 01:02:25,791
But yeah it's not what Alex's

1263
01:02:26,047 --> 01:02:26,559
Expressing

1264
01:02:28,351 --> 01:02:29,375
When I was growing up

1265
01:02:30,399 --> 01:02:31,935
He's at the n-word all the time

1266
01:02:32,191 --> 01:02:35,775
No no he never said he's never heard it

1267
01:02:36,031 --> 01:02:36,543
Lockout

1268
01:02:39,871 --> 01:02:41,151
East Texas vs the South

1269
01:02:41,663 --> 01:02:42,431
People usually get more

1270
01:02:43,455 --> 01:02:44,223
Questions

1271
01:02:44,735 --> 01:02:47,039
And trashing

1272
01:02:50,879 --> 01:02:52,415
Well I'm not trying to put down

1273
01:02:52,927 --> 01:02:54,207
Common people

1274
01:02:58,047 --> 01:03:00,095
People need to take it back and use it

1275
01:03:00,351 --> 01:03:02,399
UFC fighter

1276
01:03:02,655 --> 01:03:03,679
Black Yoshi father

1277
01:03:07,263 --> 01:03:09,567
Because she understands

1278
01:03:11,871 --> 01:03:12,383
Yeah

1279
01:03:12,639 --> 01:03:13,407
Alex's

1280
01:03:13,919 --> 01:03:14,431
Wellington

1281
01:03:14,687 --> 01:03:16,223
Reclaim the n word you know

1282
01:03:16,479 --> 01:03:17,759
You know I've always thought

1283
01:03:18,015 --> 01:03:22,111
Not my first thought about people whenever I've heard the n-word haha

1284
01:03:22,367 --> 01:03:22,879
Trashy that is

1285
01:03:23,391 --> 01:03:29,535
I prefer a more high-class form of racism thank you very much it was a strange way for a

1286
01:03:29,791 --> 01:03:30,815
Alex to claim that he

1287
01:03:31,071 --> 01:03:32,607
Never heard this word used

1288
01:03:32,863 --> 01:03:33,631
Cuz he was Christian

1289
01:03:33,887 --> 01:03:34,655
Yep

1290
01:03:34,911 --> 01:03:35,679
That's tragic

1291
01:03:36,703 --> 01:03:37,983
Strange I don't believe anymore

1292
01:03:38,495 --> 01:03:39,775
Look

1293
01:03:40,031 --> 01:03:40,799
Text when he was younger

1294
01:03:41,311 --> 01:03:44,127
He wore a suit like a silly shirt maybe a shirt

1295
01:03:44,383 --> 01:03:46,687
Did I had colors that led to

1296
01:03:46,943 --> 01:03:47,455
Kids to mock him

1297
01:03:48,991 --> 01:03:53,855
Said haha haha

1298
01:03:54,111 --> 01:03:57,695
If so much of his career attached

1299
01:03:59,231 --> 01:04:00,511
This has to do with Joe somehow

1300
01:04:00,767 --> 01:04:01,279
Okay

1301
01:04:02,047 --> 01:04:02,815
I remember being like

1302
01:04:04,863 --> 01:04:08,447
Go to public school first few years I would private school teachers ever coming back

1303
01:04:09,727 --> 01:04:11,519
Sixth grade to public school

1304
01:04:14,335 --> 01:04:15,103
Making fun of my shirt

1305
01:04:15,615 --> 01:04:16,127
Blackpink

1306
01:04:16,639 --> 01:04:17,151
Green

1307
01:04:17,663 --> 01:04:18,687
Kind of plaid

1308
01:04:18,943 --> 01:04:20,223
Shirt my mama give me a

1309
01:04:20,991 --> 01:04:22,271
Clockwork Orange

1310
01:04:26,623 --> 01:04:28,415
There was a look at his look at his

1311
01:04:30,719 --> 01:04:34,815
White remember laughing at him

1312
01:04:35,327 --> 01:04:36,351
I started laughing too

1313
01:04:37,375 --> 01:04:39,423
I am I don't mind

1314
01:04:39,935 --> 01:04:40,703
Cousin

1315
01:04:41,471 --> 01:04:43,519
But the same time

1316
01:04:44,543 --> 01:04:45,567
You're feeling

1317
01:04:47,359 --> 01:04:47,871
That's okay

1318
01:04:50,687 --> 01:04:51,711
But

1319
01:04:52,223 --> 01:04:52,735
Ruby rhod

1320
01:04:52,991 --> 01:04:54,271
Okay this is weird like

1321
01:04:54,527 --> 01:05:00,415
Alexandra going out of his way to make a point that Rogan didn't apologize for saying the n-word over and over again on his show

1322
01:05:00,671 --> 01:05:01,951
That's strange because Joe

1323
01:05:02,207 --> 01:05:02,719
Did

1324
01:05:02,975 --> 01:05:07,327
Right he did release a 6-minute video where is unequivocal about how he sorry

1325
01:05:07,583 --> 01:05:09,375
It doesn't matter if using the word

1326
01:05:09,631 --> 01:05:11,167
Is in context or out of context

1327
01:05:11,423 --> 01:05:12,191
It's bad no matter what

1328
01:05:12,447 --> 01:05:14,751
Here is like the end of his apology

1329
01:05:18,079 --> 01:05:19,103
It look I can't go back

1330
01:05:22,175 --> 01:05:23,455
I wish I could obviously.

1331
01:05:24,735 --> 01:05:25,503
But I do hope

1332
01:05:26,271 --> 01:05:27,295
This can be a t

1333
01:05:27,551 --> 01:05:28,063
Teachable moment

1334
01:05:30,367 --> 01:05:31,135
It doesn't realize

1335
01:05:32,159 --> 01:05:32,927
Offensive

1336
01:05:33,439 --> 01:05:33,951
That word

1337
01:05:36,511 --> 01:05:37,279
In contacts

1338
01:05:37,535 --> 01:05:38,047
Sporadic

1339
01:05:39,839 --> 01:05:40,863
My sincere

1340
01:05:41,119 --> 01:05:41,631
And

1341
01:05:42,143 --> 01:05:42,655
Humble Pie

1342
01:05:43,679 --> 01:05:45,471
I wish there was more that I could say

1343
01:05:48,031 --> 01:05:48,543
Just me talk

1344
01:05:53,919 --> 01:05:54,431
Hopefully

1345
01:05:54,943 --> 01:05:55,455
At least

1346
01:05:55,967 --> 01:05:56,479
Some of you

1347
01:05:56,991 --> 01:05:57,503
Will accept

1348
01:06:03,647 --> 01:06:04,415
Sincere deep

1349
01:06:06,719 --> 01:06:08,767
It is at my apologies and I had to up it

1350
01:06:09,023 --> 01:06:10,815
Serious

1351
01:06:11,327 --> 01:06:11,839
Yeah

1352
01:06:12,095 --> 01:06:18,239
I think there's some problems with his biology mostly because it's not accurate to help Joe actually use the word on his show

1353
01:06:18,495 --> 01:06:23,615
He claims he never wanted to be a friend to for entertainment value but I don't think that accurately holds up

1354
01:06:24,127 --> 01:06:25,663
If you consider some of the times he uses like

1355
01:06:26,175 --> 01:06:27,455
Fairly offensive language

1356
01:06:28,223 --> 01:06:28,735
Clearly

1357
01:06:29,503 --> 01:06:31,807
Shaka defensiveness

1358
01:06:32,319 --> 01:06:38,463
Sometimes there's just a note asking and saying transgressive words and he does not really deal with that

1359
01:06:38,719 --> 01:06:39,231
In that apology

1360
01:06:39,743 --> 01:06:44,607
And then of course there's a very confusing explanation for his racist Planet of the Apes story

1361
01:06:45,119 --> 01:06:50,495
But that's another matter and we talked about that clip back when Alex was using it against him during the Sneaky Snake.

1362
01:06:51,007 --> 01:06:57,151
Amazing Alex

1363
01:06:57,663 --> 01:07:00,991
Alex's pretending to be really offended by Jose Planet of the Apes story

1364
01:07:01,247 --> 01:07:04,063
Gazelle all the stuff is a game.

1365
01:07:04,575 --> 01:07:07,135
Alex's comments leave me with two possible

1366
01:07:07,391 --> 01:07:07,903
Conclusions

1367
01:07:08,415 --> 01:07:08,927
1

1368
01:07:09,183 --> 01:07:15,327
Oz making up Joe telling him that he didn't apologize and this is Alex trying to save face with his racist flash free

1369
01:07:15,583 --> 01:07:16,607
Free Speech obsessed audience

1370
01:07:17,375 --> 01:07:20,447
Rogan is his means of presenting himself as relevant to the mainstream

1371
01:07:20,703 --> 01:07:25,567
Broken becomes irrelevant Alex's audience if he backs down to pressure like this and does

1372
01:07:25,823 --> 01:07:27,615
Stand up for racism / free speech

1373
01:07:28,383 --> 01:07:31,455
How to protect from the backlash that reality would cause

1374
01:07:31,711 --> 01:07:32,223
Was in his heart

1375
01:07:33,503 --> 01:07:34,783
Second possibility

1376
01:07:35,295 --> 01:07:39,903
Joe did actually tell Alex this stuff and his apology videos just b******* that he didn't mean

1377
01:07:40,415 --> 01:07:44,511
Use a trying to protect the brand and not lose the Spotify deal so he did what he had to do

1378
01:07:44,767 --> 01:07:50,911
Animated boilerplate apology video all well reassuring Alex behind the scenes that he totally defends racism flash freeze

1379
01:07:51,423 --> 01:07:57,567
It's hard for me to see a third explanation for Alex's steadfast insistence that Joe definitely didn't apologize

1380
01:07:57,823 --> 01:07:59,103
What he totally did

1381
01:07:59,871 --> 01:08:01,919
Yeah that is

1382
01:08:02,175 --> 01:08:02,687
I mean

1383
01:08:02,943 --> 01:08:03,455
Listen

1384
01:08:04,479 --> 01:08:05,503
Semantically

1385
01:08:05,759 --> 01:08:06,527
That isn't Apollo

1386
01:08:07,295 --> 01:08:08,831
That's just how words

1387
01:08:09,599 --> 01:08:10,367
Unfortunately

1388
01:08:10,879 --> 01:08:11,903
So you can't really argue

1389
01:08:12,415 --> 01:08:13,695
So that is an apology

1390
01:08:14,463 --> 01:08:20,607
Is there is there is there is an appearance of giving some thought to it like more than some

1391
01:08:20,863 --> 01:08:24,191
Apologies you hear there is a 2B

1392
01:08:24,959 --> 01:08:25,983
A wrestling with some

1393
01:08:26,239 --> 01:08:32,383
Some of it it does seem again more like we're living in different time periods you know like

1394
01:08:32,639 --> 01:08:36,991
He's coming at us from 1950s men being like

1395
01:08:37,247 --> 01:08:39,295
If you did not know this

1396
01:08:39,807 --> 01:08:43,135
The N word can be used in a hurtful manner now

1397
01:08:43,391 --> 01:08:46,463
All of my friends and I we have never heard of this before

1398
01:08:46,719 --> 01:08:51,583
But I have suddenly discovered so I hope this can be a teachable moment for all of you out there

1399
01:08:51,839 --> 01:08:53,631
Who had no clue

1400
01:08:54,143 --> 01:08:55,679
But using the n-word

1401
01:08:55,935 --> 01:08:56,447
Could be

1402
01:08:59,775 --> 01:09:05,919
I do think that there are some people who may need to have that teachable lesson and if Rogan's going to deliver it maybe that's a way that

1403
01:09:06,175 --> 01:09:09,759
Could get through to that that's what I'm saying. That's cuz they're living in the 1950s

1404
01:09:10,271 --> 01:09:16,415
I do I don't know what it is but it just feels like Alec

1405
01:09:16,671 --> 01:09:17,183
Text trying to

1406
01:09:17,439 --> 01:09:18,719
Control Jose narrative

1407
01:09:18,975 --> 01:09:19,487
For him

1408
01:09:19,999 --> 01:09:20,511
In a way

1409
01:09:20,767 --> 01:09:21,535
And I don't

1410
01:09:22,047 --> 01:09:23,071
No why you do that

1411
01:09:23,327 --> 01:09:24,351
I mean I think

1412
01:09:24,607 --> 01:09:25,119
Because

1413
01:09:25,631 --> 01:09:26,655
You want it both ways

1414
01:09:27,167 --> 01:09:27,935
You know you want

1415
01:09:28,191 --> 01:09:34,335
You want Joe to have his Spotify deal you want him to continue to be in the mainstream and if he is in the

1416
01:09:34,591 --> 01:09:35,359
The mainstream he has

1417
01:09:35,615 --> 01:09:36,127
Do apologize

1418
01:09:36,639 --> 01:09:40,479
There's no way for him to continue but if he apologizes and it's clear to your audience

1419
01:09:40,735 --> 01:09:41,247
Then

1420
01:09:41,503 --> 01:09:42,015
Exactly

1421
01:09:43,295 --> 01:09:49,439
You have to say that his apology is not an apology and you have to say that johri and Joe will say that his apology isn't apology

1422
01:09:49,695 --> 01:09:52,511
And everybody is happy because the status quo is restored

1423
01:09:52,767 --> 01:09:54,559
And we can do this all again in 3 or 4 months

1424
01:09:54,815 --> 01:09:58,655
It's great everybody wins the media Alex Jones

1425
01:09:58,911 --> 01:10:01,727
And the only people who lose are everyone on the fuc

1426
01:10:01,983 --> 01:10:08,127
Planet Alex feels the need to go back on Joe show-and-tell want he'll use the

1427
01:10:09,663 --> 01:10:11,455
Do it all the time

1428
01:10:11,711 --> 01:10:14,015
Alex did get a couple calls from truckers

1429
01:10:14,271 --> 01:10:16,063
They were uneventful

1430
01:10:16,319 --> 01:10:16,831
He also

1431
01:10:17,087 --> 01:10:17,855
Is going to need to preempt

1432
01:10:18,111 --> 01:10:18,879
These trucks

1433
01:10:19,135 --> 01:10:23,743
There's not much on my show that can preempt

1434
01:10:23,999 --> 01:10:26,047
Awesome truck drivers an activist

1435
01:10:26,815 --> 01:10:28,607
Face jail time

1436
01:10:28,863 --> 01:10:31,167
And a huge fines to stand up for all of our medical rides

1437
01:10:32,191 --> 01:10:35,519
But I like to get to your next check with this Trump nuclear war Trump

1438
01:10:37,567 --> 01:10:38,079
The highest

1439
01:10:39,103 --> 01:10:39,871
Is nuclear war

1440
01:10:43,199 --> 01:10:43,711
You got I guess

1441
01:10:44,991 --> 01:10:45,503
The

1442
01:10:46,015 --> 01:10:47,039
Clubs

1443
01:10:48,063 --> 01:10:51,903
What happened to all the colors that are holding Shea in Ohio

1444
01:10:52,927 --> 01:10:54,207
Josh and Canada

1445
01:10:55,487 --> 01:10:56,767
And Sass and Andy

1446
01:10:57,535 --> 01:10:59,583
Clayton and David in the order that they received

1447
01:11:00,095 --> 01:11:02,399
But I got to go ahead and get this this is already in my stack

1448
01:11:07,519 --> 01:11:08,031
Can we are

1449
01:11:09,055 --> 01:11:10,591
Joe Biden already said quote

1450
01:11:13,151 --> 01:11:13,663
There today

1451
01:11:14,175 --> 01:11:15,455
That's a World War

1452
01:11:18,527 --> 01:11:19,807
America.

1453
01:11:20,319 --> 01:11:23,391
Shoots down reports evaluation in Azure in a war Russia

1454
01:11:25,183 --> 01:11:27,743
That's pretty Sensational but he has a lot of trouble talking

1455
01:11:27,999 --> 01:11:33,887
Silex isn't taking this commented by Maiden contact we don't think

1456
01:11:34,143 --> 01:11:39,007
Send troops into Ukraine to rescue Americans left there if they chose to stay in the country

1457
01:11:39,263 --> 01:11:40,031
Because quote

1458
01:11:40,287 --> 01:11:44,127
That's what World War when Americans and Russia start shooting at one another

1459
01:11:45,151 --> 01:11:51,295
The rhetoric lying around from the government seems a bit over-the-top and honestly I'm not sure what the exact strategy is here but it

1460
01:11:51,551 --> 01:11:54,623
It's critical to understand the world war

1461
01:11:55,135 --> 01:11:58,719
That was being used as an explanation for why he wasn't going to do something

1462
01:11:58,975 --> 01:12:04,095
I do I do love that malicious level of Minnesota is just like listen

1463
01:12:04,351 --> 01:12:09,471
We're not going to do this dumb thing if we did something that stupid that's a World War

1464
01:12:11,263 --> 01:12:13,311
That's the world

1465
01:12:13,823 --> 01:12:15,103
Jesus man

1466
01:12:15,359 --> 01:12:18,431
Wow completely Miss reporting

1467
01:12:18,687 --> 01:12:20,479
This comment because he's just seeing the headline

1468
01:12:20,735 --> 01:12:22,527
Biden said that's a World War

1469
01:12:22,783 --> 01:12:27,647
Do you have no contact with the comments he's telling his audience that Biden has come out and said we're at war with Russia

1470
01:12:27,903 --> 01:12:29,951
I meant Alex has the nerve to claim that bite

1471
01:12:30,207 --> 01:12:31,487
, was Sensational when

1472
01:12:31,743 --> 01:12:34,815
Most of the sensationalism is coming from Alex's unwillingness to read

1473
01:12:35,839 --> 01:12:39,935
Ridiculous leave Ukraine that might be

1474
01:12:40,191 --> 01:12:43,775
I was thinking it's more like what I moved the moon hits your eye

1475
01:12:44,799 --> 01:12:47,615
That's it that's the world

1476
01:12:47,871 --> 01:12:49,407
I couldn't come up with the second one

1477
01:12:49,663 --> 01:12:51,199
We maybe could ever count

1478
01:12:53,759 --> 01:12:55,039
If you want if you

1479
01:12:55,295 --> 01:12:56,575
You come up with a better line please

1480
01:12:56,831 --> 01:13:02,975
Write it on your nearest bathroom stall indeed absolutely somebody go round Kenosha

1481
01:13:03,231 --> 01:13:07,583
Timer

1482
01:13:07,839 --> 01:13:10,143
So look they're starting this world war

1483
01:13:10,399 --> 01:13:12,447
World War Z

1484
01:13:12,703 --> 01:13:18,847
It isn't Alex believe that it's kind of because the trucker Convoy was too successful

1485
01:13:30,367 --> 01:13:32,415
But one Big Slice of the

1486
01:13:33,439 --> 01:13:35,487
What equation is so bad

1487
01:13:36,767 --> 01:13:37,279
So horrible

1488
01:13:37,791 --> 01:13:38,559
Haven at Main

1489
01:13:43,679 --> 01:13:45,983
You think they're just going to let us be them on this whole

1490
01:13:48,031 --> 01:13:48,543
They're going to start

1491
01:13:50,079 --> 01:13:51,871
Turn on believer this cars

1492
01:13:54,431 --> 01:13:55,711
Oh my God

1493
01:13:56,735 --> 01:13:58,015
So

1494
01:13:58,271 --> 01:13:58,783
So real

1495
01:13:59,039 --> 01:14:00,319
Surrealism ocean

1496
01:14:00,831 --> 01:14:05,439
Smoldering this does throw him into chaos for the rest of

1497
01:14:05,695 --> 01:14:06,207
The show

1498
01:14:06,463 --> 01:14:08,511
He is f***** up threatening show

1499
01:14:08,767 --> 01:14:10,559
I don't know what happened but he gets

1500
01:14:10,815 --> 01:14:11,583
Real weird

1501
01:14:12,863 --> 01:14:16,703
It's been a fairly normal Alex a show so far there's the

1502
01:14:16,959 --> 01:14:20,543
The ambition to talk to truckers the call problem with

1503
01:14:20,799 --> 01:14:26,943
Getting truckers on the line on Maddox come out a couple of them and then we're going to preempt them because of this breaking news

1504
01:14:27,199 --> 01:14:27,711
Or that's a war

1505
01:14:27,967 --> 01:14:28,735
Yeah yeah

1506
01:14:28,991 --> 01:14:32,831
So Alex is like I knew this was coming course I told you guys

1507
01:14:33,087 --> 01:14:34,367
Back in August literally Psych

1508
01:14:35,391 --> 01:14:36,671
What did I tell you back in

1509
01:14:40,511 --> 01:14:41,279
That wasn't

1510
01:14:46,143 --> 01:14:47,423
Whole story but

1511
01:14:48,447 --> 01:14:50,751
Multiple

1512
01:14:51,007 --> 01:14:51,519
Redskin

1513
01:14:52,287 --> 01:14:53,055
The military

1514
01:14:54,335 --> 01:14:55,103
Corporate world

1515
01:14:58,943 --> 01:14:59,455
They were told

1516
01:15:03,295 --> 01:15:04,575
Cuz all the big guy

1517
01:15:05,343 --> 01:15:07,135
Congress is involved in insider trading

1518
01:15:07,391 --> 01:15:08,927
Paylater

1519
01:15:09,183 --> 01:15:09,695
Okay

1520
01:15:13,023 --> 01:15:14,303
That's where we are

1521
01:15:20,447 --> 01:15:21,471
The Russians attack

1522
01:15:21,727 --> 01:15:22,239
And then

1523
01:15:23,519 --> 01:15:26,079
Pictures of default Airline no do you inject yourself

1524
01:15:26,847 --> 01:15:29,151
We should not just believe the Russians we should want to see proof

1525
01:15:30,687 --> 01:15:32,223
We should have international observers there

1526
01:15:32,735 --> 01:15:38,879
Whew now Alex wants international Observer we're all very interested in the UN sounds like you getting in

1527
01:15:41,951 --> 01:15:43,743
Get the f*** out

1528
01:15:43,999 --> 01:15:45,023
Throw baseball at

1529
01:15:45,279 --> 01:15:49,119
I don't believe that Alex has any of these high-level Source actually wouldn't

1530
01:15:49,375 --> 01:15:55,519
Be too surprised if someone told him at the beginning of fall last year that there might be trouble with Russia in early 2020

1531
01:15:55,775 --> 01:15:56,287
Me too

1532
01:15:56,543 --> 01:15:59,615
The reason for that is that last June they do have the Brussels something

1533
01:15:59,871 --> 01:16:02,687
Where was reiterated that Ukraine was on the path to joining

1534
01:16:02,943 --> 01:16:07,039
And if there wasn't anything that Russia could do to block that process from

1535
01:16:07,551 --> 01:16:09,087
Like an internal perspective

1536
01:16:09,343 --> 01:16:11,647
I could see this news reaching Alex

1537
01:16:11,903 --> 01:16:14,463
By about August through one of his associates

1538
01:16:14,719 --> 01:16:15,743
Maybe they would look back

1539
01:16:15,999 --> 01:16:21,119
2008 when the Bucharest Summit happened and then Georgia was affirmed as being on the pasta NATO membership

1540
01:16:21,375 --> 01:16:23,167
And then a few months later war broke out

1541
01:16:23,679 --> 01:16:25,471
It wouldn't be a terribly hard predict

1542
01:16:25,727 --> 01:16:31,615
Come to make though I'm not a hundred percent sure it's a predictable end up being correct

1543
01:16:31,871 --> 01:16:33,151
The history of the Sun

1544
01:16:33,407 --> 01:16:35,967
You could see some aggression coming from

1545
01:16:36,479 --> 01:16:42,623
Russian the face of one of these NATO Summit they've explicitly said they cannot

1546
01:16:42,879 --> 01:16:45,439
Not join NATO is affirmed as joint

1547
01:16:45,695 --> 01:16:47,743
No I don't

1548
01:16:48,255 --> 01:16:53,119
It's weird because I don't actually believe that that's impossible for someone to have told Alex

1549
01:16:53,631 --> 01:16:54,655
August of last year

1550
01:16:54,911 --> 01:16:56,191
Yeah I think it's possible

1551
01:16:56,447 --> 01:17:00,543
A lot of the times I don't believe anything you say I think he might have

1552
01:17:00,799 --> 01:17:02,335
Possibly hurt that he would

1553
01:17:03,871 --> 01:17:10,015
In 2000 it wasn't like anybody had never been like hey I think Osama Bin Laden is probably trying to do something

1554
01:17:11,295 --> 01:17:15,135
Well yeah cuz he already did and he's going to eat that he's that type of guy

1555
01:17:15,391 --> 01:17:16,159
He's not a quitter

1556
01:17:16,671 --> 01:17:17,183
You know

1557
01:17:18,207 --> 01:17:20,767
Their patterns you can see it

1558
01:17:21,023 --> 01:17:21,791
So

1559
01:17:22,303 --> 01:17:23,839
I'm going to skip over it

1560
01:17:24,095 --> 01:17:27,167
That's my eulogy for a soffit mud

1561
01:17:27,423 --> 01:17:32,799
Wasn't a quitter quitter quitter quitter

1562
01:17:33,055 --> 01:17:38,687
I want to skip over an interview with someone from the rebel Lady by the name of Sheila Gunn Reid

1563
01:17:39,199 --> 01:17:39,967
Yeah Gunn

1564
01:17:40,223 --> 01:17:40,735
Little man

1565
01:17:41,247 --> 01:17:42,271
She born for this

1566
01:17:42,527 --> 01:17:48,671
She's not she is basically a press spokesperson for the

1567
01:17:48,927 --> 01:17:49,951
It's it's not

1568
01:17:50,719 --> 01:17:51,487
More

1569
01:17:51,743 --> 01:17:52,255
Though

1570
01:17:52,511 --> 01:17:53,023
Alex

1571
01:17:53,279 --> 01:17:54,047
Does more calls

1572
01:17:54,303 --> 01:17:55,071
And this guy might

1573
01:17:55,327 --> 01:17:56,095
Broken Alex's brain

1574
01:17:56,607 --> 01:17:57,375
He supports

1575
01:17:57,887 --> 01:17:58,655
The convoys

1576
01:17:59,935 --> 01:18:00,447
Because of God

1577
01:18:01,215 --> 01:18:04,031
We don't wrestle against flesh and blood but

1578
01:18:05,311 --> 01:18:06,079
All these against

1579
01:18:06,335 --> 01:18:06,847
Hours

1580
01:18:07,359 --> 01:18:08,639
Against the rulers of the darkness

1581
01:18:08,895 --> 01:18:09,919
The sage no

1582
01:18:11,711 --> 01:18:13,503
I get arrested

1583
01:18:13,759 --> 01:18:17,087
On Saturday so I'm doing this

1584
01:18:17,343 --> 01:18:18,367
I don't care at all

1585
01:18:19,135 --> 01:18:21,439
You're right and everybody's been calling in with

1586
01:18:22,207 --> 01:18:24,767
That quote on how to make a t-shirt that says

1587
01:18:25,023 --> 01:18:27,327
We wrestle not against flesh and blood but against

1588
01:18:27,583 --> 01:18:28,095
Principalities

1589
01:18:28,863 --> 01:18:30,911
Powers against the rulers of Darkness of this world

1590
01:18:34,751 --> 01:18:35,519
Nnnnn

1591
01:18:35,775 --> 01:18:36,799
Ephesians and above

1592
01:18:37,311 --> 01:18:39,615
The join the resistance infowars.com because

1593
01:18:39,871 --> 01:18:41,151
This is a spiritual fighting

1594
01:18:41,407 --> 01:18:43,455
None of this makes sense Until you realize

1595
01:18:43,967 --> 01:18:47,551
People serving that's are literally demonically inspired

1596
01:18:47,807 --> 01:18:49,599
Michigan

1597
01:18:49,855 --> 01:18:51,647
She looks like a freaking Jacqueline

1598
01:18:52,159 --> 01:18:54,719
She doesn't

1599
01:18:54,975 --> 01:18:55,999
That is a demon

1600
01:18:56,255 --> 01:19:00,607
I got to say I kind of agree with Alex that none of this makes sense

1601
01:19:00,863 --> 01:19:01,631
Unless

1602
01:19:01,887 --> 01:19:03,935
You've taken all that other stuff

1603
01:19:04,191 --> 01:19:10,335
Ye are safe I mystical novel

1604
01:19:10,591 --> 01:19:12,127
I asked back to reality

1605
01:19:12,383 --> 01:19:15,455
That is just made up as Alex goes along as he sees fit

1606
01:19:16,479 --> 01:19:17,759
Yeah none of it doesn't make sense without

1607
01:19:19,551 --> 01:19:21,855
Spell I mean I hate

1608
01:19:22,111 --> 01:19:26,975
I hate it but like if that's what that guy's really all about if he's out here fighting for freedom

1609
01:19:27,231 --> 01:19:27,743
Then

1610
01:19:28,255 --> 01:19:28,767
Do that

1611
01:19:29,023 --> 01:19:31,583
Where a fight for Freedom needs to happen

1612
01:19:31,839 --> 01:19:33,631
As opposed to wear some

1613
01:19:33,887 --> 01:19:37,215
A****** has lied you into believing that freedom is being fought right now

1614
01:19:37,983 --> 01:19:39,775
Like what are we doing

1615
01:19:40,031 --> 01:19:43,359
Either you either you're a giant monster racist or your

1616
01:19:43,615 --> 01:19:47,455
Fighting For Freedom you know whatever I think it's easy to

1617
01:19:47,711 --> 01:19:51,295
You know make make a wrong choice on what Pro tattoo might go to

1618
01:19:51,551 --> 01:19:54,879
I'll beat somebody up too hard for it but I do want to say

1619
01:19:55,391 --> 01:19:57,439
If you do go to any protest

1620
01:19:57,951 --> 01:20:01,279
Bad to assume that the people you're there protesting against

1621
01:20:01,535 --> 01:20:02,815
Are literal demons

1622
01:20:03,071 --> 01:20:03,583
Right

1623
01:20:03,839 --> 01:20:06,143
Right don't think that's going to be a productive

1624
01:20:06,399 --> 01:20:08,191
Protest

1625
01:20:08,447 --> 01:20:09,471
Magna health

1626
01:20:09,983 --> 01:20:12,287
This is just labeled Alex is a lunatic

1627
01:20:13,311 --> 01:20:14,080
Josh

1628
01:20:14,848 --> 01:20:17,152
Yeah you know that the truckers are heroes

1629
01:20:17,408 --> 01:20:19,200
And everything but

1630
01:20:20,480 --> 01:20:20,992
Something price

1631
01:20:21,248 --> 01:20:22,528
God bless you all

1632
01:20:26,112 --> 01:20:26,624
It's real they hate

1633
01:20:32,256 --> 01:20:34,304
Who's going to oppose our mark of the beast world

1634
01:20:36,352 --> 01:20:40,448
Not according to the Bible

1635
01:20:42,496 --> 01:20:43,264
Woodwind

1636
01:20:44,544 --> 01:20:45,056
Chess

1637
01:20:47,616 --> 01:20:50,176
Interdimensional

1638
01:20:50,688 --> 01:20:52,224
The full spectrum of reality

1639
01:20:52,736 --> 01:20:53,760
And and they're they're here

1640
01:20:55,552 --> 01:20:56,320
There's God

1641
01:20:56,832 --> 01:20:57,600
Maybe universe

1642
01:21:00,416 --> 01:21:01,184
And then there's

1643
01:21:04,512 --> 01:21:05,024
They want to hurt people

1644
01:21:06,304 --> 01:21:07,328
They see you as an anime

1645
01:21:07,840 --> 01:21:09,120
They're an enemy military

1646
01:21:09,888 --> 01:21:12,960
That Hacienda dimensionally get you to kill yourself or hurt yourself

1647
01:21:15,008 --> 01:21:17,568
Troy

1648
01:21:18,592 --> 01:21:19,104
What

1649
01:21:19,360 --> 01:21:20,896
Boys and girls

1650
01:21:22,432 --> 01:21:24,992
That it's all about hurting our children because they see that

1651
01:21:34,720 --> 01:21:36,768
We don't like something the Creator

1652
01:21:37,024 --> 01:21:38,816
Conscious colorful or older

1653
01:21:41,888 --> 01:21:43,424
Twisters person this spirit

1654
01:21:46,752 --> 01:21:52,896
So I may hear Clips like that and it really makes you think about like I was on. I was scrolling

1655
01:21:53,152 --> 01:21:56,480
Around Twitter and I saw somebody posted a clip of

1656
01:21:56,992 --> 01:21:59,552
And he was talking about how Alex Jones is

1657
01:22:00,064 --> 01:22:03,648
Just as good of a reporter is anybody on CNN he's

1658
01:22:03,904 --> 01:22:08,512
Yeah he's been right about all kinds of stuff he's on the ball and like

1659
01:22:08,768 --> 01:22:10,304
Interdimensional at least I

1660
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:11,072
Just

1661
01:22:11,584 --> 01:22:13,120
Want people to own

1662
01:22:13,376 --> 01:22:13,888
This

1663
01:22:14,656 --> 01:22:16,960
Like if you're going to vouch for Alex

1664
01:22:17,472 --> 01:22:18,240
Know what his

1665
01:22:18,496 --> 01:22:19,520
F****** show is

1666
01:22:19,776 --> 01:22:21,568
Hey I know that what you're doing

1667
01:22:22,080 --> 01:22:22,848
His backing

1668
01:22:23,104 --> 01:22:24,384
A lunatic

1669
01:22:24,896 --> 01:22:26,432
Fundamentalist I dare not

1670
01:22:26,688 --> 01:22:29,760
Even call him a Christian Fundamentalist

1671
01:22:30,016 --> 01:22:34,112
Absolutely wears a hat that says Christian with actual belief system is

1672
01:22:34,880 --> 01:22:37,184
A Bazaar

1673
01:22:38,464 --> 01:22:40,256
What we're looking at here

1674
01:22:40,512 --> 01:22:44,352
People to have a better understanding

1675
01:22:44,608 --> 01:22:45,376
Of like

1676
01:22:45,888 --> 01:22:50,496
I know it's fun and edgy and you feel like you're countercultural in some way to say like

1677
01:22:50,752 --> 01:22:53,312
No actually Alex is really good at

1678
01:22:53,568 --> 01:22:54,080
His job

1679
01:22:54,336 --> 01:22:57,408
But you know people people give him a bad Shake because of

1680
01:22:57,664 --> 01:23:00,224
XYZ you know do know he gives himself a bad shape

1681
01:23:01,504 --> 01:23:03,296
It's not as it isn't laundry ball

1682
01:23:03,808 --> 01:23:06,624
Yeah I know I mean nobody does Alex

1683
01:23:06,880 --> 01:23:08,160
More of a favor

1684
01:23:08,672 --> 01:23:11,488
Then everybody who reports on Alex and is just like

1685
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:13,024
I mean I can't work

1686
01:23:13,792 --> 01:23:16,608
You know let's do the thing that's relevant to today

1687
01:23:17,120 --> 01:23:18,912
Let's pull from his show with relevant

1688
01:23:19,168 --> 01:23:19,680
Today

1689
01:23:19,936 --> 01:23:25,056
So it looks like the entire TV show is relevant to today as opposed to Let's

1690
01:23:25,312 --> 01:23:27,872
Pull from the show that's relevant and then let's pull from

1691
01:23:28,128 --> 01:23:31,200
Him decrying how interdimensional demons

1692
01:23:31,456 --> 01:23:35,296
Going to take over Governor Whitman mersal

1693
01:23:35,552 --> 01:23:37,600
Because she looks like what

1694
01:23:37,856 --> 01:23:39,648
And the other thing is that like

1695
01:23:40,160 --> 01:23:43,488
I do think that none of these people actually have watch

1696
01:23:43,744 --> 01:23:46,048
People like a Tim pool character

1697
01:23:46,304 --> 01:23:49,376
Like it if not actually engaged with the material that he

1698
01:23:49,632 --> 01:23:50,144
He's putting out

1699
01:23:50,400 --> 01:23:53,216
Or spent the time to listen to this dogshit show

1700
01:23:53,472 --> 01:23:55,008
They see the clips that

1701
01:23:55,264 --> 01:23:58,848
Like maybe get posted by rightwingwatch or something

1702
01:23:59,104 --> 01:24:03,712
Only come up with a way to make an explanation for why it's not as crazy as it sounds

1703
01:24:03,968 --> 01:24:06,784
Or maybe it's politically

1704
01:24:07,040 --> 01:24:11,648
Similar to something they believe about how Trump is great right or something

1705
01:24:12,160 --> 01:24:13,184
You know he what he was

1706
01:24:13,440 --> 01:24:16,768
You was all like Trump was right about Russia stuff and like

1707
01:24:17,280 --> 01:24:19,328
Hey listen listen to his actual show

1708
01:24:19,584 --> 01:24:21,120
Before you get it because it's

1709
01:24:21,376 --> 01:24:23,168
It's totally unacceptable I think

1710
01:24:23,680 --> 01:24:24,192
Are you here

1711
01:24:24,704 --> 01:24:25,472
Stuff like this

1712
01:24:25,984 --> 01:24:26,752
As people are

1713
01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:29,824
Yeah I mean

1714
01:24:30,848 --> 01:24:32,128
It's the same thing that they do with Trump

1715
01:24:32,384 --> 01:24:36,992
Is you create a fictional version of this person in order to serve your own purpose

1716
01:24:37,504 --> 01:24:41,344
Nobody's nobody on the far right is like listen

1717
01:24:41,856 --> 01:24:43,136
I understand the Trump

1718
01:24:43,392 --> 01:24:44,416
Has some problem

1719
01:24:44,672 --> 01:24:45,184
Princeton

1720
01:24:45,440 --> 01:24:48,256
He steals a bunch of money from everybody who's ever worked

1721
01:24:48,768 --> 01:24:52,352
He steals a bunch of money from everybody who hasn't worked well

1722
01:24:52,608 --> 01:24:55,936
He takes a bunch of money from people who are murdering other people

1723
01:24:56,192 --> 01:24:57,472
He's an evil guy

1724
01:24:57,728 --> 01:24:58,496
But

1725
01:25:00,032 --> 01:25:02,336
You know he was on TV for a while he's pretty good

1726
01:25:02,592 --> 01:25:03,872
It's true

1727
01:25:04,128 --> 01:25:08,992
You got to see it I think you could have a very similar breakdown for a

1728
01:25:09,504 --> 01:25:14,624
Without watching his show you're not aware of all of those things that are like the real

1729
01:25:14,880 --> 01:25:16,416
The real things that you're you're really

1730
01:25:16,672 --> 01:25:20,512
You're really promoting in your coat is cozying up to and

1731
01:25:22,560 --> 01:25:24,096
Sort of selling to your audience

1732
01:25:24,352 --> 01:25:25,120
What's in a deceitful bag

1733
01:25:25,888 --> 01:25:27,424
And I find that to be repulsive

1734
01:25:28,192 --> 01:25:29,728
Yep anyway

1735
01:25:29,984 --> 01:25:31,264
Globalists are losing

1736
01:25:31,520 --> 01:25:33,568
We're getting it back to spirituality here in a minute

1737
01:25:33,824 --> 01:25:34,336
But

1738
01:25:34,592 --> 01:25:35,360
Go-Buster losing

1739
01:25:37,152 --> 01:25:39,456
Well I mean we are ahead by 50 but again

1740
01:25:40,224 --> 01:25:41,504
Last shot is worth 51 point

1741
01:25:41,760 --> 01:25:42,272
And

1742
01:25:42,528 --> 01:25:43,296
They have like

1743
01:25:43,808 --> 01:25:47,136
50 different balls look at you into that basket

1744
01:25:47,648 --> 01:25:50,208
Got a bunch of those

1745
01:25:52,512 --> 01:25:53,792
Just know this we're winning

1746
01:25:55,072 --> 01:25:56,608
Things aren't going well for the globalist

1747
01:25:57,376 --> 01:25:58,912
They had some contingency plan

1748
01:26:01,984 --> 01:26:03,008
We resist but they are

1749
01:26:03,520 --> 01:26:04,288
Crap in the riches

1750
01:26:06,080 --> 01:26:08,384
Crap and they're bitching get all confident on me yet

1751
01:26:08,896 --> 01:26:09,664
Because

1752
01:26:09,920 --> 01:26:10,688
You know the

1753
01:26:13,248 --> 01:26:15,808
But as long as we know what

1754
01:26:16,064 --> 01:26:17,856
Blackouts

1755
01:26:18,112 --> 01:26:19,136
Wars

1756
01:26:19,392 --> 01:26:20,672
Field goal

1757
01:26:22,208 --> 01:26:23,232
Currency collapses

1758
01:26:24,256 --> 01:26:25,024
Waste Wars

1759
01:26:25,792 --> 01:26:28,352
As long as we know what dirty trading ball trick

1760
01:26:28,608 --> 01:26:29,120
After sleeve

1761
01:26:33,984 --> 01:26:35,008
Basic human rights

1762
01:26:37,568 --> 01:26:40,128
Super tricks they have up their sleeve are just about

1763
01:26:40,384 --> 01:26:40,896
Anything

1764
01:26:41,152 --> 01:26:42,432
I mean

1765
01:26:42,688 --> 01:26:43,200
Listen

1766
01:26:43,456 --> 01:26:46,528
They are all wearing carnations

1767
01:26:46,784 --> 01:26:47,808
Do not go smell

1768
01:26:48,320 --> 01:26:50,624
I will tell you right now it is connected

1769
01:26:50,880 --> 01:26:53,184
To a little pump Ono spray water right

1770
01:26:53,440 --> 01:26:56,256
Your face her Dietrich

1771
01:26:56,512 --> 01:27:00,864
Currency collapse

1772
01:27:01,120 --> 01:27:07,264
Dirty dirty tricks area

1773
01:27:07,520 --> 01:27:09,312
Take a little bit of the power out of

1774
01:27:09,568 --> 01:27:15,456
Claiming to understand the enemy's Playbook when they took they could do a lot of dirty tricks

1775
01:27:15,712 --> 01:27:16,992
Now I will tell you

1776
01:27:17,248 --> 01:27:23,392
Having studied them for my entire life they can do literally anything all of their powers are on blast at all times

1777
01:27:23,648 --> 01:27:26,464
And there's nothing any of us can do to stop it

1778
01:27:26,720 --> 01:27:28,000
We are winning

1779
01:27:28,256 --> 01:27:30,304
They have a lot of tricks

1780
01:27:31,328 --> 01:27:32,352
Everything

1781
01:27:32,864 --> 01:27:35,424
So dumb and I know what they're going to do everything

1782
01:27:35,680 --> 01:27:37,472
So it starts waxing poetic

1783
01:27:37,728 --> 01:27:42,592
A little bit here I think he got into the spirit there a little bit earlier talking about how there's the angels

1784
01:27:43,360 --> 01:27:45,152
And all the demons had a fight

1785
01:27:45,408 --> 01:27:48,224
He starts thinking about how like my whole career

1786
01:27:49,504 --> 01:27:50,016
It was God

1787
01:27:50,784 --> 01:27:53,856
God did the whole thing God didn't do this he did it

1788
01:27:54,880 --> 01:27:56,160
Here we are

1789
01:27:56,672 --> 01:27:57,184
God

1790
01:27:57,440 --> 01:27:58,720
Did every bit of this

1791
01:27:59,744 --> 01:28:03,328
Kitty God and the devil did every bit of it on the other side

1792
01:28:04,864 --> 01:28:05,632
That's not how it works

1793
01:28:07,936 --> 01:28:09,984
God and the devil are just as real as night and day

1794
01:28:12,288 --> 01:28:14,848
Well actually

1795
01:28:15,104 --> 01:28:18,688
God they're really created by

1796
01:28:25,856 --> 01:28:26,368
There's a chief

1797
01:28:27,648 --> 01:28:28,928
He's got a lot of other

1798
01:28:29,184 --> 01:28:29,952
Change

1799
01:28:30,464 --> 01:28:32,256
That Motley Crue

1800
01:28:32,768 --> 01:28:35,072
That goes along with his plan

1801
01:28:36,864 --> 01:28:38,656
And his plan is not God's plan

1802
01:28:38,912 --> 01:28:40,192
God's plan

1803
01:28:40,704 --> 01:28:41,728
Freewheel

1804
01:28:41,984 --> 01:28:43,008

Goodness and Discovery and end

Creation

1810
01:28:51,968 --> 01:28:52,736
So good

01:29:01,440 --> 01:29:02,976
A few times conscious Anaconda

1816
01:29:03,744 --> 01:29:04,512
Sleeping table

1817
01:29:06,304 --> 01:29:06,816
Go with him

1818
01:29:07,072 --> 01:29:08,096
In the presence of God

1819
01:29:08,352 --> 01:29:09,376
Believably status

1820
01:29:09,888 --> 01:29:11,168
The Holy Spirit

1821
01:29:13,472 --> 01:29:14,240
What gods or a butt

1822
01:29:14,496 --> 01:29:15,008
To be in God

1823
01:29:15,264 --> 01:29:16,288
Realpresence

1824
01:29:16,800 --> 01:29:17,312
Is like

1825
01:29:22,688 --> 01:29:24,992
Complete

1826
01:29:29,088 --> 01:29:29,600
Completion

1827
01:29:33,440 --> 01:29:34,720
This goes on forever

1828
01:29:35,232 --> 01:29:37,024
This is eternity this is timelessness

1829
01:29:37,536 --> 01:29:39,072
Oh I can do everything now

1830
01:29:42,144 --> 01:29:43,680
Just want to go all God I love you

1831
01:29:43,936 --> 01:29:44,704
Oh man

1832
01:29:45,984 --> 01:29:47,008
What a what a journalist

1833
01:29:47,264 --> 01:29:49,824
What what a great

1834
01:29:50,080 --> 01:29:50,592
Grass

1835
01:29:51,104 --> 01:29:54,944
Of One's Own belief system the book that it isn't

1836
01:29:55,200 --> 01:29:55,712
Entirely based

1837
01:29:56,224 --> 01:29:56,736
Sure

1838
01:29:57,248 --> 01:29:59,808
Truly an astonishing level of under

1839
01:30:00,064 --> 01:30:06,208
Understanding responding two different things

1840
01:30:06,464 --> 01:30:07,744
More

1841
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:08,768
The

1842
01:30:09,280 --> 01:30:09,792
I've been

1843
01:30:10,048 --> 01:30:10,560
Gods

1844
01:30:10,816 --> 01:30:13,888
Crescent Shores literally multiple times

1845
01:30:14,400 --> 01:30:15,424
I mean

1846
01:30:15,936 --> 01:30:16,704
Who Among Us

1847
01:30:16,960 --> 01:30:18,752
Had not felt God's touch at least once

1848
01:30:19,776 --> 01:30:20,544
I think that would Alex

1849
01:30:20,800 --> 01:30:21,824
Describing a little more than

1850
01:30:22,080 --> 01:30:28,224
That he may have had a dream but I get a drink I think he may have had a couple of drinks

1851
01:30:28,480 --> 01:30:30,016
Maybe he did some hallucinogenic

1852
01:30:30,272 --> 01:30:32,320
1 * possible

1853
01:30:32,832 --> 01:30:34,368
I heard it crack on that beat

1854
01:30:34,624 --> 01:30:35,904
When he was in high school

1855
01:30:36,672 --> 01:30:38,464
You know as it as a Bipolar person

1856
01:30:38,720 --> 01:30:42,304
I had a manic episode once when I was much younger

1857
01:30:42,560 --> 01:30:46,912
And hallucinated the s*** out of everything and I to met Jesus

1858
01:30:47,168 --> 01:30:47,936
Now

1859
01:30:48,192 --> 01:30:50,752
Later on when I was no longer in that manic episode

1860
01:30:51,008 --> 01:30:52,032
I said to myself

1861
01:30:52,288 --> 01:30:53,824
That was not actually Jesus

1862
01:30:54,336 --> 01:30:55,872
And there we go it was me

1863
01:30:56,128 --> 01:30:59,456
Had I gone it was me

1864
01:31:00,480 --> 01:31:04,576
When there was only one set of footsteps in the lies it was you caring me Dad

1865
01:31:04,832 --> 01:31:05,856
I think

1866
01:31:06,112 --> 01:31:08,160
If you if you had just

1867
01:31:08,416 --> 01:31:14,560
Sort of I got to run back in a run with Wildwood

1868
01:31:14,816 --> 01:31:16,864
Chemistry can make

1869
01:31:17,632 --> 01:31:20,192
Certain experiences much more

1870
01:31:20,448 --> 01:31:21,216
Memorable attic

1871
01:31:21,472 --> 01:31:23,264
Extreme

1872
01:31:23,776 --> 01:31:24,800
And I think that's

1873
01:31:25,056 --> 01:31:25,568
What year experience

1874
01:31:25,824 --> 01:31:28,128
Figure with Alex nuts

1875
01:31:28,640 --> 01:31:29,664
Yeah he's absolutely nuts

1876
01:31:29,920 --> 01:31:32,736
Because it doesn't matter if he believes

1877
01:31:32,992 --> 01:31:33,504
What he say

1878
01:31:33,760 --> 01:31:35,808
Know if you don't believe what you're saying

1879
01:31:36,576 --> 01:31:38,624
You're so nuts for saying that

1880
01:31:38,880 --> 01:31:40,416
And if you believe what you're saying

1881
01:31:41,952 --> 01:31:44,256
Both of those things are equally nuts

1882
01:31:45,280 --> 01:31:46,048
So he's not

1883
01:31:46,304 --> 01:31:48,352
Man good reporter though really cute

1884
01:31:48,608 --> 01:31:50,144
Basically just like

1885
01:31:50,400 --> 01:31:51,168
I don't know

1886
01:31:51,424 --> 01:31:55,008
Stelzer or Brian stelter

1887
01:31:55,264 --> 01:31:58,080
I remember Jake Tapper going into his guttural voice

1888
01:31:58,592 --> 01:32:02,176
I am calling upon the ancient gods of sumaira to Smite his enemies

1889
01:32:02,432 --> 01:32:04,224
It was just like a weird day for her

1890
01:32:04,480 --> 01:32:09,856
Yeah you know like a regular experience

1891
01:32:10,112 --> 01:32:15,488
Fullness Lenny

1892
01:32:15,744 --> 01:32:20,096
Closest most of the shows these days we just accept it

1893
01:32:22,656 --> 01:32:28,800
No this is Alex's particular brand of insanity

1894
01:32:29,056 --> 01:32:31,616
About to his religious belief reporting on his religion

1895
01:32:31,872 --> 01:32:34,688
Just believe and I think he's reporting that

1896
01:32:34,944 --> 01:32:37,760
God created humans to destroy Satan

1897
01:32:38,016 --> 01:32:38,528
I think

1898
01:32:38,784 --> 01:32:41,088
That's what he said you're okay I may be wrong

1899
01:32:41,856 --> 01:32:43,136
Can you imagine the people that

1900
01:32:43,648 --> 01:32:45,952
Had the opportunity to be with that

1901
01:32:46,464 --> 01:32:47,744
And decided to break with

1902
01:32:48,768 --> 01:32:50,304
Saw that is slavery

1903
01:32:53,120 --> 01:32:56,960
Build whatever you want to do whatever you wanted know whatever you wanted

1904
01:32:57,216 --> 01:32:58,496
Buddy wouldn't God

1905
01:33:04,128 --> 01:33:04,640
Isn't.

1906
01:33:08,224 --> 01:33:08,992
Nest app

1907
01:33:13,600 --> 01:33:14,368
Oh by the way

1908
01:33:14,624 --> 01:33:16,160
I'm creating all these new tent

1909
01:33:16,416 --> 01:33:17,184
Entities

1910
01:33:17,440 --> 01:33:18,464
Freewheel just like I did

1911
01:33:19,488 --> 01:33:21,024
Little tiny versions of myself

1912
01:33:21,280 --> 01:33:22,304
Go ahead and have that app

1913
01:33:23,584 --> 01:33:24,096
Let's see

1914
01:33:24,352 --> 01:33:25,120
If you can even

1915
01:33:25,632 --> 01:33:26,144
Beat

1916
01:33:29,728 --> 01:33:30,240
My babies

1917
01:33:33,824 --> 01:33:35,360
Okay there comes the argument is

1918
01:33:38,432 --> 01:33:38,944
I just lonely

1919
01:33:39,712 --> 01:33:40,480
What

1920
01:33:40,992 --> 01:33:41,760
Communion

1921
01:33:42,528 --> 01:33:43,040
And so God

1922
01:33:43,296 --> 01:33:43,808
I did this

1923
01:33:44,576 --> 01:33:45,088
Okay

1924
01:33:45,344 --> 01:33:47,648
Alright so God's lonely

1925
01:33:47,904 --> 01:33:49,696
Or he wanted

1926
01:33:50,208 --> 01:33:51,232
To watch us beat up

1927
01:33:51,744 --> 01:33:52,256
Yeah

1928
01:33:52,512 --> 01:33:55,584
So I'm just going to throw this out there

1929
01:33:55,840 --> 01:33:59,168
For people who are Christian and who listen to Alec

1930
01:33:59,424 --> 01:33:59,936
Alex Jones

1931
01:34:00,192 --> 01:34:01,728
I just a reminder

1932
01:34:02,240 --> 01:34:07,872
Every bit of suffering and Terror and death Unleashed upon this world is purely because it's

1933
01:34:08,128 --> 01:34:08,640
Creator

1934
01:34:08,896 --> 01:34:09,664
Was real lonely

1935
01:34:10,176 --> 01:34:16,320
So I everything that you've done or ever have or whatever will do is pointless useless and is only there to make

1936
01:34:16,576 --> 01:34:17,856
A weird sadist

1937
01:34:18,368 --> 01:34:19,136
Well Alexander

1938
01:34:19,392 --> 01:34:19,904
It's not sadism

1939
01:34:20,160 --> 01:34:26,304
I think this is just sort of like a twisted and childish understanding of like that idea

1940
01:34:26,560 --> 01:34:28,352
Yeah those like if there is A1

1941
01:34:28,864 --> 01:34:32,960
Solitary unit Unity of God to be in

1942
01:34:33,472 --> 01:34:36,288
Then it would want to experience itself in

1943
01:34:36,544 --> 01:34:40,128
You know that's how you do fractions of it

1944
01:34:40,640 --> 01:34:41,920
Become other consciousnesses

1945
01:34:42,176 --> 01:34:43,200
I think that's kind of

1946
01:34:43,712 --> 01:34:44,736
What is the thread

1947
01:34:44,992 --> 01:34:45,504
Pulling on

1948
01:34:45,760 --> 01:34:51,904
With that I guess but I feel like he's pulling on it more as though God we're Superman and Missy and Satan was Lexi

1949
01:34:52,928 --> 01:34:54,464
I don't disagree

1950
01:34:54,976 --> 01:34:55,744
But also

1951
01:34:56,256 --> 01:34:57,536
I'd wanted

1952
01:34:57,792 --> 01:34:59,840
Babies

1953
01:35:02,912 --> 01:35:03,936
So God created the judge

1954
01:35:04,448 --> 01:35:09,312
Alright is not normal for Alex's show

1955
01:35:09,824 --> 01:35:11,360
That's troubling true

1956
01:35:11,616 --> 01:35:12,640
Alex

1957
01:35:12,896 --> 01:35:14,432
Understands God's plan

1958
01:35:15,456 --> 01:35:16,480
Mm2 script

1959
01:35:16,736 --> 01:35:18,016
Ends in a very jarring way

1960
01:35:18,784 --> 01:35:20,064
And then there comes the argument

1961
01:35:21,344 --> 01:35:21,856
Whatever exists

1962
01:35:22,112 --> 01:35:22,880
God

1963
01:35:23,136 --> 01:35:23,648
Lonely

1964
01:35:24,928 --> 01:35:26,464
God wanted communion with us

1965
01:35:27,232 --> 01:35:27,744
And so God

1966
01:35:28,000 --> 01:35:28,512
Did this

1967
01:35:31,840 --> 01:35:32,352
Forgot the choice

1968
01:35:33,120 --> 01:35:33,632
Consciousness

1969
01:35:34,912 --> 01:35:35,424
Weather

1970
01:35:35,936 --> 01:35:36,960
Preciate it

1971
01:35:37,472 --> 01:35:37,984
I totally

1972
01:35:39,520 --> 01:35:40,544
God is perfect

1973
01:35:41,312 --> 01:35:42,080
And the perfect spot

1974
01:35:42,336 --> 01:35:43,104
How to do this

1975
01:35:43,616 --> 01:35:45,152
The Satanist will always argue

1976
01:35:45,408 --> 01:35:46,688
Why is your god allowed

1977
01:35:46,944 --> 01:35:48,224
Why is your god allowed

1978
01:35:48,480 --> 01:35:49,760
Why is your God allow all this

1979
01:35:50,016 --> 01:35:53,344
Why your God cuz we got free will

1980
01:35:53,600 --> 01:35:55,136
Cuz he was lonely

1981
01:35:55,392 --> 01:35:57,184
Universe

1982
01:35:58,464 --> 01:36:00,000
Texted here on Earth

1983
01:36:00,768 --> 01:36:01,792
Given

1984
01:36:06,656 --> 01:36:07,168
Cleveland

1985
01:36:08,192 --> 01:36:10,496
That you're willing to get hurt for doing the right thing

1986
01:36:11,264 --> 01:36:12,288
Nothing good

1987
01:36:15,616 --> 01:36:17,920
The song called apologize

1988
01:36:18,432 --> 01:36:19,712
Those are all the longest coming

1989
01:36:19,968 --> 01:36:21,248
Preaching here today

1990
01:36:22,528 --> 01:36:24,576
Boy wow

1991
01:36:24,832 --> 01:36:29,184
That's wow I thought that we had given up on the trucker protest

1992
01:36:29,440 --> 01:36:32,000
Cuz we had moved on to that deep

1993
01:36:32,512 --> 01:36:33,792
Deep philosophical Quest

1994
01:36:34,048 --> 01:36:34,560
Lessons about the

1995
01:36:35,328 --> 01:36:39,424
Meaning of life but the nature of Angels and Demons

1996
01:36:39,936 --> 01:36:40,448
Gods

1997
01:36:40,704 --> 01:36:42,240
Supposed plans nope now

1998
01:36:43,520 --> 01:36:44,288
Nobody

1999
01:36:44,544 --> 01:36:45,312
Can pull off

2000
01:36:45,824 --> 01:36:47,104
I mean I don't think Alex did

2001
01:36:47,360 --> 01:36:49,152
Don't get me wrong I think no one

2002
01:36:49,408 --> 01:36:49,920
Literally

2003
01:36:50,176 --> 01:36:54,016
Can pull off that kind of a transition

2004
01:36:54,272 --> 01:37:00,416
No no no no no you have to be tested to give you

2005
01:37:01,696 --> 01:37:02,720
It's hot man

2006
01:37:02,976 --> 01:37:09,120
Dubstep clunky as Hell by satanists are always at all why is there suffering

2007
01:37:09,376 --> 01:37:11,680
Oh man why didn't God just make a best friend

2008
01:37:12,448 --> 01:37:13,984
You guys could have had such great times

2009
01:37:14,240 --> 01:37:17,824
You're the best friends just holding hands walking across the infinite nuts

2010
01:37:18,080 --> 01:37:19,104
Epicness of the universe

2011
01:37:19,360 --> 01:37:21,152
That would have been an option

2012
01:37:21,408 --> 01:37:24,224
Great way to go yeah but you know

2013
01:37:24,736 --> 01:37:26,016
It's not good enough just have 14

2014
01:37:26,272 --> 01:37:27,808
Community

2015
01:37:28,064 --> 01:37:29,344
And then once you have a community

2016
01:37:29,600 --> 01:37:30,368
Doll f***

2017
01:37:30,624 --> 01:37:32,672
Jasmine Evelyn ship Lego

2018
01:37:32,928 --> 01:37:35,488
Anyway we have we have One Last Cry

2019
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:36,512
Jordan

2020
01:37:36,768 --> 01:37:39,840
And this is Alex describing how

2021
01:37:41,120 --> 01:37:41,632
Keep fighting

2022
01:37:42,656 --> 01:37:43,168
Got it

2023
01:37:43,424 --> 01:37:44,192
The trucks

2024
01:37:45,728 --> 01:37:46,752
Big fan of the truck

2025
01:37:47,008 --> 01:37:47,520
Totally Trucks

2026
01:37:47,776 --> 01:37:49,568
Are going well they're defeating globulus

2027
01:37:50,336 --> 01:37:51,616
All the covid-19 sense

2028
01:37:52,128 --> 01:37:53,152
It behind us but

2029
01:37:53,408 --> 01:37:53,920
It's going to come back

2030
01:37:54,432 --> 01:37:56,224
And also the globalists have 100 different Drake

2031
01:37:56,480 --> 01:37:57,504
Right of anything

2032
01:37:57,760 --> 01:38:00,832
Any disaster or horrible thing phrase in the car

2033
01:38:01,088 --> 01:38:02,880
And the only way to stop it is bathroom Goofy

2034
01:38:03,648 --> 01:38:04,928
Treaty of good

2035
01:38:06,976 --> 01:38:12,864
There's some other things you could do but you probably almost everybody

2036
01:38:14,144 --> 01:38:15,168
But yeah you just got to keep fighting

2037
01:38:15,424 --> 01:38:17,216
Got to go get dissolution

2038
01:38:17,472 --> 01:38:17,984
Give me some money

2039
01:38:18,240 --> 01:38:21,568
Things are not going the way they wanted them to so this is

2040
01:38:22,848 --> 01:38:26,944
And we got to go reconstituted we are we going to rebuild our infrastructure

2041
01:38:27,712 --> 01:38:30,016
We got to know that we're waking up to the fight were in

2042
01:38:30,272 --> 01:38:32,320
This was just one battle that were barely winning

2043
01:38:33,088 --> 01:38:35,136
Barely wake is going to get much more serious

2044
01:38:37,696 --> 01:38:39,232
More

2045
01:38:40,256 --> 01:38:40,768
And the more we wake up

2046
01:38:43,584 --> 01:38:44,096
Fear

2047
01:38:44,352 --> 01:38:47,168
We care about our children and our future we don't care about what the globalist

2048
01:38:47,680 --> 01:38:48,704
Say about us

2049
01:38:49,216 --> 01:38:50,496
Stronger we get

2050
01:38:50,752 --> 01:38:52,544
God doesn't give you anything

2051
01:38:55,872 --> 01:38:56,640
Enemy Step Up

2052
01:38:57,664 --> 01:38:59,968
You're going to be one of the people that helps take down the New World Order

2053
01:39:00,224 --> 01:39:01,248
This broadcast is the temp

2054
01:39:04,832 --> 01:39:06,112
Shell command Monday

2055
01:39:07,648 --> 01:39:08,416
Got it

2056
01:39:08,672 --> 01:39:09,184
Shop

2057
01:39:09,440 --> 01:39:12,000
Be right now

2058
01:39:12,256 --> 01:39:13,792
You can't even get a reaction out of you

2059
01:39:14,048 --> 01:39:15,328
From that anymore help

2060
01:39:15,584 --> 01:39:16,096
No

2061
01:39:16,352 --> 01:39:22,496
Nothing there wasn't even like an eyebrow rise

2062
01:39:23,776 --> 01:39:27,872
You could give me somebody was just there and I'm bleeding out of his

2063
01:39:28,128 --> 01:39:34,272
His voice is the severe call to action if you can be a part of the actual taking down to the new world order book

2064
01:39:34,528 --> 01:39:35,296
Is really about the

2065
01:39:35,552 --> 01:39:36,064
The sale

2066
01:39:36,320 --> 01:39:38,624
But he's got going on at infowars.com with all these

2067
01:39:39,136 --> 01:39:40,672
Great pills and what have you

2068
01:39:40,928 --> 01:39:43,232
It's a it's a disguise call to action

2069
01:39:43,488 --> 01:39:45,024
I observed

2070
01:39:45,280 --> 01:39:45,792
Become

2071
01:39:46,048 --> 01:39:46,560
Little bit

2072
01:39:46,816 --> 01:39:47,840
To do recruiters

2073
01:39:48,352 --> 01:39:50,656
How it how is it that so many people get

2074
01:39:50,912 --> 01:39:52,192
Tricked into believing

2075
01:39:52,448 --> 01:39:52,960
That

2076
01:39:53,472 --> 01:39:57,056
The real way to defeat the New World Order is Commerce

2077
01:39:57,312 --> 01:39:58,080
And it's not

2078
01:39:58,336 --> 01:39:58,848
Biden

2079
01:39:59,104 --> 01:40:00,384
Design exactly

2080
01:40:00,640 --> 01:40:03,712
Part of the New World Order

2081
01:40:03,968 --> 01:40:06,272
At least in Alex's case I think it's

2082
01:40:06,528 --> 01:40:08,832
Because the exact same things like why do people think

2083
01:40:09,600 --> 01:40:10,880
XYZ is martial law

2084
01:40:12,160 --> 01:40:12,672
Yeah

2085
01:40:12,928 --> 01:40:17,536
That's right the feeling of fighting against the New World Order that Satisfied by

2086
01:40:17,792 --> 01:40:18,304
Supporting

2087
01:40:18,560 --> 01:40:19,584
Him little man

2088
01:40:19,840 --> 01:40:21,376
Yeah that's that's the marketing

2089
01:40:21,888 --> 01:40:28,032
Yeah and it's and it's a good sale because it doesn't feel like Commerce motivated to do it

2090
01:40:28,288 --> 01:40:28,800
Out of the fight

2091
01:40:29,312 --> 01:40:34,176
And it feels really good cuz you don't have to do anything and if you actually did go into the fight dude that is

2092
01:40:34,432 --> 01:40:39,552
Not feel good most of the time

2093
01:40:39,808 --> 01:40:41,344
It goes downhill pretty real quick

2094
01:40:41,600 --> 01:40:42,368
Real quick

2095
01:40:42,624 --> 01:40:47,488
There's blood you know nobody is like this $25

2096
01:40:49,024 --> 01:40:49,792
Kill me

2097
01:40:51,584 --> 01:40:52,352
I think

2098
01:40:53,632 --> 01:40:59,776
In a little bit of a little bit it's hard for me to tell because

2099
01:41:00,032 --> 01:41:06,176
Little sleep and so I am I'm kind of a little frazzled

2100
01:41:06,432 --> 01:41:08,224
It was a weird ride

2101
01:41:08,736 --> 01:41:10,016
Yeah the the

2102
01:41:10,784 --> 01:41:14,112
The way with which Alex's is reporting on this the Caravan

2103
01:41:14,368 --> 01:41:14,880
Amstaff

2104
01:41:15,136 --> 01:41:17,696
Clearly nonspecifically for the most part.

2105
01:41:17,952 --> 01:41:19,488
Selling the feeling of it being

2106
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:21,024
Successful intake

2107
01:41:21,280 --> 01:41:23,328
Walking down the covid Sharon over whatever

2108
01:41:23,584 --> 01:41:25,888
Is it strange cuz I don't

2109
01:41:26,144 --> 01:41:28,448
I think it's a long-term solution to his problem

2110
01:41:28,960 --> 01:41:30,752
I think this is a Band-Aid right

2111
01:41:31,008 --> 01:41:32,544
I think it's going to fall off right

2112
01:41:32,800 --> 01:41:33,568
Before too long

2113
01:41:34,336 --> 01:41:38,432
But then the way that the rhetoric is also shifting within that conversation

2114
01:41:38,688 --> 01:41:39,968
He's really really scary

2115
01:41:40,736 --> 01:41:43,552
And then his bizarre religious like

2116
01:41:43,808 --> 01:41:44,832
Swing

2117
01:41:45,344 --> 01:41:46,368
It didn't last like

2118
01:41:46,624 --> 01:41:48,416
40 minutes of his show

2119
01:41:48,672 --> 01:41:49,952
Just upsetting and strain

2120
01:41:50,208 --> 01:41:50,720
Yeah

2121
01:41:50,976 --> 01:41:54,048
I feel like here's what here's what I'm feeling disoriented

2122
01:41:54,304 --> 01:41:54,816
Weis

2123
01:41:55,072 --> 01:41:57,376
Like I feel like I just watched somebody

2124
01:41:57,632 --> 01:42:00,192
You trying to scam me with a three-card Monte game you know

2125
01:42:00,704 --> 01:42:04,288
And they were moving the car then I got out of the first one was I got that

2126
01:42:04,544 --> 01:42:07,104
And then they just kept doing it not at a high level

2127
01:42:07,360 --> 01:42:08,896
But four of long

2128
01:42:11,200 --> 01:42:15,040
Just switching the cards around just switching the cards around until I'm just like I did

2129
01:42:15,552 --> 01:42:16,320
I don't know

2130
01:42:16,576 --> 01:42:17,600
I don't know man

2131
01:42:17,856 --> 01:42:18,368
What are we doing

2132
01:42:18,624 --> 01:42:19,136
What are we doing

2133
01:42:19,392 --> 01:42:24,768
Go to follow the car but I got bored a long time ago that I

2134
01:42:25,280 --> 01:42:26,048
What are we doing

2135
01:42:26,304 --> 01:42:29,888
Whitney by the person doing the car now.

2136
01:42:30,144 --> 01:42:30,656
I got you

2137
01:42:30,912 --> 01:42:31,680
Exactly

2138
01:42:31,936 --> 01:42:35,520
Cuz I just got to you

2139
01:42:37,568 --> 01:42:38,848
K

2140
01:42:39,104 --> 01:42:40,128
I guess

2141
01:42:42,176 --> 01:42:47,808
Do we still have a web we do I was going to try and come up with something clever sort of we have a house of cards

2142
01:42:48,064 --> 01:42:52,416
Woven Alex's devil demon

2143
01:42:52,672 --> 01:42:58,048
But I couldn't come up with one on the fly in a certain Dimension you could say that our website is called now that right

2144
01:42:58,560 --> 01:43:01,888
That is true interdimensional available on the world wide web

2145
01:43:02,144 --> 01:43:05,984
Absolutely

2146
01:43:06,240 --> 01:43:12,128
We will never go on Twitter and another really got kicked off 48 Twitter

2147
01:43:12,384 --> 01:43:14,944
No it was that was censorship

2148
01:43:15,200 --> 01:43:20,064
We f***** with time Cancel culture

2149
01:43:20,320 --> 01:43:21,344
Until then

2150
01:43:21,600 --> 01:43:22,880
Emilio Emilio on PCs

2151

Clerk I'm Daryl rhombus
