Oh no

42
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:30,016
The Federal Reserve Act was

43
00:02:31,552 --> 00:02:34,112
Florida house for three members

44
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:35,648
Cameras were on the floor

45
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:39,488
At that time he needed a majority of votes

46
00:02:39,744 --> 00:02:40,512

47
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,864

Completely

51
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:49,984
Unacceptable

52
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,520
Unforgivable things

53
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:54,336
Just happened in this documentary

00:02:56,896 --> 00:02:58,688
The Federal Reserve Act Fast with just

56
00:02:58,944 --> 00:03:00,736
Three members of Congress on the floor

57
00:03:01,248 --> 00:03:02,016
M2

58
00:03:02,272 --> 00:03:05,344
Alex Jones didn't fact check that at all

59
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:09,184
Before allowing this to be in his dumbass documentary

60
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:09,952
I'm going to

61
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,792
That whole that whole like

62
00:03:14,304 --> 00:03:15,584
The Federal Reserve Act

63
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,352
Pass with j

64
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:17,888
Just three members on the floor

65
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:19,168
I just let that one

66
00:03:21,728 --> 00:03:23,264
That's so silly

67
00:03:24,544 --> 00:03:30,688
And nonsensical brother

68
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:32,480

00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:39,392
Where'd you learn from Rock Falls

70
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,952
I don't understand the words you're saying

71
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:44,000
Because nobody ever taught you how to speak

72
00:03:45,024 --> 00:03:45,792
Here's the deal

73
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:48,864
The myth surrounding the passage of the Federal Reserve Act

74
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,912
Is the evil

75
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:52,448
Wait until Christmas break

76
00:03:52,704 --> 00:03:58,848
When they knew that no Congressman would be around force their legislation through

77
00:03:59,104 --> 00:04:01,152
Could enslave the country

78
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:02,176
Compelling story

79
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:07,808
Complete

80
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,856

837

88
00:04:26,239 --> 00:04:28,543
It was debated on September 18th

89
00:04:29,055 --> 00:04:30,079
1813 Pasteur

90
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:32,127
Weather

91
00:04:32,383 --> 00:04:32,895
Is the problem

92
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:34,175
Amended version

93
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:35,455
I was sent back to the house

94
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:38,015
This inability to come to a consensus

95
00:04:38,271 --> 00:04:40,063
Until December 22nd

96
00:04:41,087 --> 00:04:42,367
When the house agreed

97
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:43,903
Prince version of the

98
00:04:44,159 --> 00:04:47,743
And it passed by a vote of 296 260

99
00:04:47,999 --> 00:04:49,535
The 76 not voting

100
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:50,303
320

101
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:51,327
The next day

102
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:54,399
The conference board

103
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:56,447
With 43

104
00:04:56,703 --> 00:04:57,727
1025

105
00:04:57,983 --> 00:04:58,751
With 27

106
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:01,311
How do you feel about that

107
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:06,175
I got it

108
00:05:06,687 --> 00:05:09,247
People in the house who didn't vote don't really matter

109
00:05:12,575 --> 00:05:14,111
Senators who didn't vote

110
00:05:16,159 --> 00:05:19,743
Where was Christmas break

111
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:29,215
Instability

112
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:31,007
This is where Alex Azar

113
00:05:31,263 --> 00:05:32,799
Ron Paul

114
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:34,591
Wheatley misrepresenting to save it

115
00:05:34,847 --> 00:05:35,615
3 people

116
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:40,735
Historically

117
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:45,343
Betty's

118
00:05:46,623 --> 00:05:47,391
3 people

119
00:05:47,647 --> 00:05:49,951
We're on the floor and 18.

120
00:05:56,607 --> 00:06:02,751
Bears

121
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:03,519
Exactly

122
00:06:03,775 --> 00:06:04,543
27 knots

123
00:06:04,799 --> 00:06:05,823
Voting in the

124
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:08,127
Is where

125
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:15,807
Of course works with votes that are happening during times of likely to be on vacation is that members

126
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:17,343
Congress try really hard to help

127
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:18,111
Each other out

128
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:20,415
What's the plan what's called

129
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:21,695
Announced pairs

130
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:22,719
People

131
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:24,255
Without affecting the out

132
00:06:25,535 --> 00:06:27,071
We saw this happening

133
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:28,607
Information Lisa murkowski

134
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:29,887
Who is opposed to The Copper

135
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:31,935
How to vote

136
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:32,959
Steve

137
00:06:33,215 --> 00:06:36,031
Favor of the confirmation could attend his daughter's wedding

138
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:42,431
There's like a congressional courtesy

139
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:48,831
Your daughter's wedding who gives a break

140
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:50,623
Live in DC or something like that

141
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:53,439
I will agree to go together

142
00:06:55,231 --> 00:06:57,023
Yeah so what happened

143
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:02,399
In the Congressional Record

144
00:07:03,935 --> 00:07:06,751
Now tears

145
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:11,871
We wouldn't show up for Christmas

146
00:07:12,383 --> 00:07:13,663
Which accounts for 26

147
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:14,687
Super 27

148
00:07:14,943 --> 00:07:15,455
Voters

149
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:21,087
Did they vote on the bill today

150
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:27,487
No way to call this abroad

151
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:31,583
Not just making stuff up which is

152
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:32,863
This is crazy

153
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:35,679
Like crazy

154
00:07:35,935 --> 00:07:41,055
Are you sick from Ron Paul's family is saying crazy

155
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:44,127
Factual

156
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:45,663
Ways to

157
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:48,991
But it would be talked about early there's a lot of ways to talk about the problems

158
00:07:49,247 --> 00:07:50,271
Who's had their own face on this

159
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:51,039
Stupid b*******

160
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:53,599
Like if you're putting a senior

161
00:07:53,855 --> 00:07:55,647
It might be embarrassing

162
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:57,439
For me to put my name on

163
00:07:57,695 --> 00:07:59,487
A video of Summer

164
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:02,815
3 people who voted on the Federal Reserve

165
00:08:03,071 --> 00:08:04,607
Without looking into it

166
00:08:04,863 --> 00:08:06,143
But what are you doing

167
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:12,031
Reason why a lot of the other stuff

168
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:13,055
He was like

169
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:17,407
Yeah

170
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:20,479
Look at you allowed this in your documentary I don't give a f*** about anything

171
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:23,807
No

172
00:08:24,063 --> 00:08:30,207
Hispanic version of it

173
00:08:30,463 --> 00:08:36,607
0220 Olney possible

174
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:39,679
Regardless of the fact

175
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:41,983
Give me three names

176
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:45,311
Give me the three names of the people voted

177
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:51,455
If you know so f****** much about this give me the three names of the people

178
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:57,855
Not argue remember if you imagine that only three people voted you should know their name Dutch

179
00:09:01,951 --> 00:09:05,279
Wayne Paul Ron Paul's brother is

180
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:06,815
Full of s***

181
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:10,399
Like

182
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:12,447
Stanbic he might believe

183
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:14,239
There's no way

184
00:09:15,007 --> 00:09:21,151
He might be Steve dial I have no f****** idea okay that's

185
00:09:21,407 --> 00:09:24,479
I don't know everything

186
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:25,247
Ikea

187
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:27,551
I can conceive of something

188
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:29,599
Version of like he's convinced

189
00:09:30,879 --> 00:09:31,903
Yeah

190
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:32,671
I suppose

191
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:34,719
The historical record shows that that's not

192
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:35,487
True

193
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:36,511
And in order to

194
00:09:36,767 --> 00:09:42,911
Extraordinary proof that what you're saying is true

195
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:43,935
Switch

196
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:45,215
Okay

197
00:09:45,471 --> 00:09:48,031
They want to believe it's better reservist

198
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:53,407
Even if

199
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:58,015
And I don't mean that in the pejorative term

200
00:09:58,271 --> 00:09:59,551
More like

201
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:00,575
Left

202
00:10:00,831 --> 00:10:02,879
Less interested in spreading

203
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:04,927
If possible

204
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:07,999
Cursory knowledge of American history

205
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:10,047
There's no way that you're to be like

206
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:12,351
Are you saying that a major bill

207
00:10:12,607 --> 00:10:14,911
That changed the course of American history

208
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:16,703
Was passed by three guys

209
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:21,567
And also Disney lyrics

210
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:24,383

The other 400 represent and the other I don't know 99

218

Are we taking these three people's asses

219
00:10:54,335 --> 00:10:56,127
Book business in 1930

220
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:57,407

221
00:10:57,663 --> 00:11:03,551
Crust

222
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:07,135
Dispel to happen

223
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:08,415
He would

224
00:11:10,207 --> 00:11:14,815
That level of other centers

225
00:11:20,191 --> 00:11:20,959
Crazy stupid

00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:38,623
Borderline

231
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:39,903
Incompetent

232
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:41,695
Liquor

233
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:51,423
That's worse than terrorists ones metaphor

234
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:55,263
Like

235
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:56,543
If you believe that

236
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:57,823
You're willing to

237
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:04,223
Go to an NSAID rally and try and convince other people that's true you are far gone

238
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:05,759
You do not know is that way Paul can

239
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:06,527
Spit hot

240
00:12:07,551 --> 00:12:08,575
I am not joking

241
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:10,879
I also should say I feel really bad about

242
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:11,647
But I didn't look

243
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:13,695
Whether or not William Paul is still alive

244
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:14,719
He might be dead

245
00:12:21,887 --> 00:12:26,495
Alright

246
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:29,823

From the 70s

264
00:13:40,735 --> 00:13:44,319
He is more but bad idea

265
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:48,927
Like the collateral for Social Security

266
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:53,279
60s

267
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:54,815
So far

268
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:57,375
All of what he has said is

269
00:13:58,399 --> 00:13:59,423
Fantastical

270
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:02,495
On a level that I wouldn't believe in a

271
00:14:03,007 --> 00:14:03,519
Novel

272
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:06,847
Fictional universe

273
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:08,639
That's

274
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:15,551
Are you seriously going to tell me that a legally

275
00:14:15,807 --> 00:14:18,879
Resolution was passed the house and the Senate

276
00:14:19,135 --> 00:14:21,183
Bi3 total guys

277
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:24,767

Validated

279
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:30,911

281
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:37,567
Knox

282
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:39,103
Fair enough

283
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:41,663
He also doesn't think black people should be allowed

284
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:43,455
Truck.

285
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:44,479
Make discount

286
00:14:44,735 --> 00:14:45,247
Country Bank

287
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:47,551
Ark ever

288
00:14:50,879 --> 00:14:51,391
Emergence

289
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:52,671
Powers

290
00:14:54,719 --> 00:14:55,231
It is

291
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:58,047
City station

292
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:00,863
It's Azteca

293
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:08,799
Manage

294
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:09,823
The bankruptcy

295
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:12,639
Bankruptcy Iverson

296
00:15:13,663 --> 00:15:14,175
Soda Prince

297
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:19,807
The miniature the bankrupt

298
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:21,343
Is probate

299
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:25,183
We're at today

300
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:32,095
Is your listen carefully you can hear Alex giving an interview to somebody else.

301
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:36,447
What are you talkin about here in terms of the bankruptcy the United

302
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:37,471
Safes

303
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:42,079
I had a strong suspicion

304
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:43,615
He's talking about the emergency

305
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:44,639
Citibank - 90

306
00:15:44,895 --> 00:15:45,407
1833

307
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:46,175
He doesn't

308
00:15:46,431 --> 00:15:52,319
U.s. Bank

309
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:56,159
I tried to look into this more to understand the argument but pretty much all the way

310
00:15:56,415 --> 00:15:57,183
Website to the purport

311
00:15:57,439 --> 00:15:59,743
Prove that the US went bankrupt in 1933

312
00:15:59,999 --> 00:16:02,303
Happened to also be the kind of websites with the word

313
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:08,703
And really scary lighters at the top of the Pole right

314
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:11,263
Version of the heart Jack

315
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:12,543
Yeah

316
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:14,079
Most of the argument

317
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:19,967
There are on these pages also rely very heavily on a forgery of a speech allegedly made by Jim traffic

318
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:21,759
1990

319
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:22,527
83

320
00:16:22,783 --> 00:16:23,551
Jim traficant if

321
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:24,575
Call

322
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:28,927
Tax evasion

323
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:30,463
Back in 2002

324
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:34,303
Would you like to him being one of the first people to be expelled

325
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:47,103
17 months

326
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:50,175
You was up to some real serious

327
00:16:50,431 --> 00:16:51,967
Where is supposed to Lake

328
00:16:52,223 --> 00:16:53,503
White supremacy

329
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:56,319
Amid

330
00:16:57,087 --> 00:17:01,695
It's what tasteful I don't know it's supposed to be like a misdemeanor

331
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:03,487
Jim Preston got out of prison

332
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:08,095
Project

333
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:13,215
It's too boring not a lot of

334
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:16,287
Is really fun

335
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:19,871
Think about for a little bit that Ron Paul

336
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:22,687
But really all I Come Away with is a realization that like

337
00:17:22,943 --> 00:17:25,503
Call Family might not be all that smart

338
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:26,527
Deeply involved in

339
00:17:27,551 --> 00:17:29,599
Like really weird Sovereign yeah

340
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:34,207
Yeah like I can't stress this enough

341
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:34,975
Play bankrupt

342
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:35,743
1930

343
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:40,607
3 is almost entirely if you look into it online almost all sources lead back

344
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:41,631
Do this speech

345
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:42,655
The gym

346
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:44,959
Gave on the the floor

347
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:48,287
It's a Forger

348
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:49,567
It's not real

349
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:50,591
It's a fake

350
00:17:50,847 --> 00:17:52,895
Speech of the guy who was the

351
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:56,479
The first guy to be expelled from the house yet

352
00:17:56,991 --> 00:17:59,807
Is using this as an example

353
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:00,831
Prove

354
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:03,903
That the American government has been bankrupt

355
00:18:04,159 --> 00:18:07,487
470

356
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:09,023
What the reason the keys

357
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:10,303
Use is the same reason

358
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:12,863
Isn't that people go back to like Abraham Lincoln

359
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:15,935
And get like apply these words to him

360
00:18:16,447 --> 00:18:17,983
It's a different strategic tactic

361
00:18:18,239 --> 00:18:19,007
Used rims

362
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:20,031
Because

363
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:26,431
They were like

364
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:32,831
No he was not on the floor yet

365
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:35,647
True that we've been bankrupt since 1933

366
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:39,231
When you can go read the Emergency Banking Act doesn't say there were

367
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:45,631
Bankrupt are so similar to women who fall in love with

368
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:47,167
Like

369
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:48,447
Like tigers

370
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:50,239
Yeah you know where it's like

371
00:18:50,495 --> 00:18:54,079
No no you guys just don't know

372
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:54,847
Committed that crime

373
00:18:56,383 --> 00:18:57,407
Much more for them

374
00:19:02,015 --> 00:19:02,527
It's it's

375
00:19:04,063 --> 00:19:10,207
It's all good at all to be resolved with a slight amount of reading that just think for once

376
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:11,487
Alright

377
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:13,279
Based on what you're saying

378
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:14,303
The

379
00:19:14,815 --> 00:19:19,167
Has been operating under emergency Powers through the treasuries

380
00:19:19,423 --> 00:19:20,959
Kateri

381
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:22,751
470 years

382
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:25,055
There's no way

383
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:26,847
That could have been kept secret

384
00:19:27,103 --> 00:19:27,615
4

385
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:29,919
Maps

386
00:19:30,175 --> 00:19:36,319
Knowing what I know about human being I mean there's a lot of people who have been in and out of the house really quick

387
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:41,439
If everything's going fine

388
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:42,719
You would have just been like

389
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:43,999
Oh yeah by the way

390
00:19:44,255 --> 00:19:45,023
This is Howard

391
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:48,095
Like if nobody notices

392
00:19:48,607 --> 00:19:49,887
It's not an emergency

393
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:51,935
True

394
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:57,055
Like you can't be operating under emergency powers for 70 years

395
00:19:57,311 --> 00:19:57,823
Betches

396
00:19:58,335 --> 00:20:02,431
Larry Nichols

397
00:20:03,711 --> 00:20:05,247
FEMA provisional government

398
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:10,111
Stuff like that it's just a special sounding turn and the reason the powers is so appealing

399
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:12,671
It's because it relates back to the Emergency Banking Act

400
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:15,743
It it has this like

401
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:17,023
Well it was an emergency

402
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:22,143
Emergency

403
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:24,191
But it's not

404
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:25,471
Yeah buddy

405
00:20:25,727 --> 00:20:26,239
Fine

406
00:20:26,495 --> 00:20:27,263
Right even if

407
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:31,871
Even if what you're saying is true it's been going on for 17 years and everybody's kind of

408
00:20:32,127 --> 00:20:32,639
Fine

409
00:20:35,455 --> 00:20:36,991
Black people are allowed to vote

410
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:41,599
And they don't like that

411
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:47,487
Congressman Ron Paul now has a huge amount

412
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:56,447
Private Federal Reserve

413
00:20:56,703 --> 00:21:02,335
And having a great time how yeah

414
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:08,735
Alex is wearing a motherfuker

00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:13,087
HR 1148 sponsors

416
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:14,879
To end the Federal Reserve

417
00:21:15,647 --> 00:21:16,416
It dies in committee

418
00:21:21,024 --> 00:21:21,792
We've now

419
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:23,328
Woken up the world

420
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:25,376

When step on February 3rd

425
00:21:39,712 --> 00:21:40,736
2009

426

Ron Paul

427
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,808
Announces hr-88

428
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,344
Federal Reserve

With no co-sponsor

430
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:49,952
Course

431
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,328
Out there with a boho

432
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:05,824
Ted Cruz's shity shity as a

433
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:12,224
Who are in Congress

434
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,528
You start to realize a lot of a f****** waste

435
00:22:14,784 --> 00:22:19,904
There's a reason that they deserve a 9% approval rate

436
00:22:21,952 --> 00:22:24,000
Too much about Ron Paul's bills

437
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:32,960
Tell you a little bit about some of them I should tell you that on May

438
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:40,384
May 8th 2012 HR 1094

To End the Fed

No co-sponsor

441
00:22:43,968 --> 00:22:44,992
How long was the belt

442
00:22:50,112 --> 00:22:52,928
End the Fed.

443
00:23:00,864 --> 00:23:01,888
No co-sponsors

444
00:23:05,728 --> 00:23:06,496
We got to get rid of these

445
00:23:07,008 --> 00:23:08,800
Every year

446
00:23:09,056 --> 00:23:12,896
Play no way every year

447
00:23:13,408 --> 00:23:15,712
Interesting ways the Ron Paul has a lot of

448
00:23:15,968 --> 00:23:18,272
Weird Corky Bells

449
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:21,856
In 1979 he introduced

450
00:23:26,464 --> 00:23:30,304
Introduced HR 2310 signature repeal

451
00:23:37,728 --> 00:23:39,520
No no

452
00:23:39,776 --> 00:23:40,800
You just misspelled

453
00:23:41,312 --> 00:23:42,848
I hate you

454
00:23:43,104 --> 00:23:45,920
Everyone works together

455
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:52,320
Brinkley Atlanta

456
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:55,648
The same here

457
00:23:56,416 --> 00:24:02,304
He introduces 1979's joint resolution

458
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:08,960
A joint resolution congratulated the United States Space Program

459
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:15,104
Supporting them developed a new field of technology to promote and Preserve

460
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:18,176
The free enterprise system the acquisition of knowledge and freedom

461
00:24:18,688 --> 00:24:24,832
Chucky with his hellish resolution

462
00:24:27,904 --> 00:24:31,232
Divided cigarette in Congress

463
00:24:31,488 --> 00:24:34,304
Has essentially been

464
00:24:34,816 --> 00:24:37,632
Leave us alone

465
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:53,504
I'm not in love

466
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:59,904
Even want to give you the appearance of me accepting you being a thing

467
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:06,304
Jump around and try to repeal the national flood insurance

468
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:09,376
What disaster protection Act of 1973

469
00:25:09,632 --> 00:25:10,912
Did not work out.

470
00:25:11,168 --> 00:25:11,936
Ghostbusters.

471
00:25:12,192 --> 00:25:17,824
HR 4984 which is titled

472
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,104
A bill to prohibit

473
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:19,872
Use of funds

474
00:25:20,128 --> 00:25:20,896
For the Peace Corps

475
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:26,528
Individuals in order for abortions to be provided to those individuals

476
00:25:31,392 --> 00:25:36,512
Just doesn't want to fund people in the Peace Corps

477
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:37,536
Get abortion

478
00:25:39,072 --> 00:25:41,376
People who are in the

479
00:25:41,632 --> 00:25:42,656
Who had abortions

480
00:25:42,912 --> 00:25:48,288
To that trap know specifically menstruation brings

481
00:25:48,544 --> 00:25:54,688
I don't understand what the point is this

482
00:25:54,944 --> 00:26:01,088
Peace Corps to travel

483
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:10,304
No Ghostbusters

484
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:18,240
A 1979's oil and water conservation

485
00:26:19,008 --> 00:26:21,824
Right no co-sponsors.

486
00:26:22,336 --> 00:26:25,152
The Hayloft

487
00:26:25,408 --> 00:26:31,296
From now on

488
00:26:33,344 --> 00:26:35,136
Spider-Man

489
00:26:35,392 --> 00:26:38,208
He did some f****** quirky as s*** while he was in office

490
00:26:38,976 --> 00:26:43,072
So here's the deal Ron Paul is in the house from 1979 to 1985

491
00:26:43,328 --> 00:26:45,120
1997

492
00:26:45,376 --> 00:26:46,144
2013

493
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:48,960
25-year

494
00:26:49,728 --> 00:26:52,032
According to the official Congressional Bill tracker

495
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:55,872
There's only one bill that he sponsored that ever became law

496
00:26:56,384 --> 00:27:02,528
It was in 1929

497
00:27:02,784 --> 00:27:04,064
And the bill

498
00:27:06,112 --> 00:27:12,256
To authorize the administrator of General Services of real property in Galveston Texas

499
00:27:12,512 --> 00:27:14,048
Galveston historical Foundation

500
00:27:14,816 --> 00:27:16,352
That's all

501
00:27:16,608 --> 00:27:18,656
Achieved of his own volition

502
00:27:18,912 --> 00:27:20,192
In 25

503
00:27:20,448 --> 00:27:21,984
Leaders of the House of Representative

504
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:27,616
Now now that those are bills that other

505
00:27:27,872 --> 00:27:29,408
Put forward that he just put his name on

506
00:27:29,920 --> 00:27:31,200
I mean like the fact

507
00:27:31,456 --> 00:27:32,992
That he has had 25 years

508
00:27:36,576 --> 00:27:37,088
Tamisha

509
00:27:37,344 --> 00:27:37,856
Suggest

510
00:27:38,368 --> 00:27:39,648
America gets what they

511
00:27:41,696 --> 00:27:42,208
Trump

512
00:27:42,976 --> 00:27:43,488
It's our fault

513
00:27:43,744 --> 00:27:45,280
Crazy

514
00:27:45,536 --> 00:27:47,072
Look guys we have it covered

515
00:27:47,328 --> 00:27:53,472
It's time for the chickens come home to roost

516
00:27:53,728 --> 00:27:59,872
Was never there never get out of order.

517
00:28:00,128 --> 00:28:04,224
Turn dogs

518
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:10,624
And those hot dogs

519
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,160
Your neck and I'm the one working

520
00:28:15,232 --> 00:28:16,256
Please pull up.

521
00:28:16,768 --> 00:28:17,536
Yeah

522
00:28:22,656 --> 00:28:23,936
It's such a good damn

523
00:28:24,704 --> 00:28:27,008
Do ya really look at it

524
00:28:27,264 --> 00:28:29,312
What did Ron Paul achieve

525
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:36,992
Confusing a lot of people about the Federal Reserve in 25 years in office like he

526
00:28:37,248 --> 00:28:40,320
Bill passed as a lot even in life

527
00:28:40,576 --> 00:28:41,856
Like what did he accomplish

528
00:28:58,496 --> 00:29:04,640
Personalized books

529
00:29:08,224 --> 00:29:12,832
Shutter failure

530
00:29:13,856 --> 00:29:16,416
I looked through all the bills he ever sponsored

531
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:18,464
I didn't see anything about

532
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,000
Like legalizing weed

533
00:29:20,512 --> 00:29:26,656
Writing like that like people

534
00:29:30,752 --> 00:29:32,544
But he never introduced legislation

535
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:35,872
It like in order to

536
00:29:36,128 --> 00:29:39,200
Breathing like that

537
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:45,344
Tomorrow

538
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,880
I'd be like

539
00:29:47,392 --> 00:29:52,512
Will you know what at least at least

540
00:29:52,768 --> 00:29:55,328
Good I feel like we made something

541
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:58,912
Well that will you know at least affect some people's lives

542
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:04,032
At least I'm not a complete Nutter failure like

543
00:30:07,104 --> 00:30:09,664
In 1913

544
00:30:11,456 --> 00:30:11,968
Take it away from

545
00:30:12,224 --> 00:30:14,784
The people

546
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:15,808
Institutional

547
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:17,600
Legible

548
00:30:21,952 --> 00:30:23,232
No more

549
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,280
Federal Express

550
00:30:31,168 --> 00:30:32,960
If we can

551
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,776
Put the Federal Reserve under Treasury

552
00:30:36,032 --> 00:30:36,800
We start

553
00:30:37,568 --> 00:30:38,080
Beautiful

554
00:30:39,104 --> 00:30:40,384
Able to

555
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:41,408
Control

556
00:30:41,664 --> 00:30:42,432
Monetary policy

557
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,480
Maybe half of the United States

558
00:30:44,992 --> 00:30:46,016
If you put

559
00:30:46,272 --> 00:30:47,040
The Federal Reserve

560
00:30:47,296 --> 00:30:48,576
Under the Department of Treasury

561
00:30:48,832 --> 00:30:49,344
3 what

562
00:30:49,856 --> 00:30:50,624
You is a wow

563
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,416
Whoever is in power to

564
00:30:52,672 --> 00:30:56,256
Control everything about the can understand

565
00:30:56,512 --> 00:30:59,072
What are the healthy weight

566
00:31:06,752 --> 00:31:12,128
The Federal Reserve has more Federal than Federal Express line

567
00:31:12,384 --> 00:31:12,896
But

568
00:31:13,152 --> 00:31:15,456
What is advocating for gray

569
00:31:15,968 --> 00:31:19,040
Quickly the ability of whoever is in power write

570
00:31:19,296 --> 00:31:22,368
Wheatley manipulate the financial system

571
00:31:22,624 --> 00:31:23,136
Would never want to be

572
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:24,928
I agree

573
00:31:25,184 --> 00:31:31,328
Percentage does look like 26 year old boy standing on top of each other wearing suit

574
00:31:31,584 --> 00:31:37,728
I know this is weird I know people who listen to the podcast game

575
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,296
Everyone

576
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:56,416
What is

577
00:31:56,672 --> 00:31:57,440
Is the

578
00:31:57,696 --> 00:31:58,208
Proper relay

579
00:31:59,232 --> 00:31:59,744
Should be the prop

580
00:32:00,768 --> 00:32:01,536
Between the chairman of the

581
00:32:01,792 --> 00:32:02,560
The fat in a president

582
00:32:05,376 --> 00:32:06,912
First of all the Federal Reserve

583
00:32:07,424 --> 00:32:07,936
Cousin

584
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:09,984
Not man's basic

585
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:13,312
No

586
00:32:13,824 --> 00:32:16,128
Go suck Iran's balls you f*****

587
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:17,408
Overruled

588
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,760
So long is that

589
00:32:22,272 --> 00:32:22,784
Is

590
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:23,552
Place

591
00:32:24,064 --> 00:32:24,832
And there is no

592
00:32:25,088 --> 00:32:25,856
Evidence that

593
00:32:26,624 --> 00:32:27,648
Administration

594
00:32:27,904 --> 00:32:28,928
Congress or anybody else

595
00:32:29,952 --> 00:32:32,512
Is requesting that we do things other than what we

596
00:32:32,768 --> 00:32:33,536
Appropriate

597
00:32:33,792 --> 00:32:34,304
NSYNC

598
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:35,072
10

599
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:35,840
What relation

600
00:32:37,632 --> 00:32:38,656
Don't Franklin Armory

601
00:32:38,912 --> 00:32:39,424
Noticed

602
00:32:41,472 --> 00:32:44,544
Alan Greenspan

603
00:32:44,800 --> 00:32:50,944
And I will marry to the issue at hand

604
00:32:51,968 --> 00:32:52,992
Making the old.

605
00:32:53,248 --> 00:32:53,760
Tempe Slayer

606
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:56,576
But like

607
00:32:56,832 --> 00:32:58,112
Alan Greenspan came on

608
00:32:58,368 --> 00:32:59,904
He's above the law that is not what he

609
00:33:01,184 --> 00:33:02,464
This Is Us

610
00:33:03,488 --> 00:33:04,000
Basically

611
00:33:04,512 --> 00:33:06,048
That on a day-to-day basis

612
00:33:06,304 --> 00:33:07,072
Congress and President

613
00:33:07,328 --> 00:33:08,608
Do not dictate

614
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:09,632
The Federal Reserve

615
00:33:10,144 --> 00:33:10,912
Specific

616
00:33:11,168 --> 00:33:13,472
Feature of the public-private nature of the bank

617
00:33:13,728 --> 00:33:15,776
No political force

618
00:33:16,032 --> 00:33:16,800
Dictate mods

619
00:33:17,312 --> 00:33:17,824
Without

620
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,104
Prefer the president have

621
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:19,872
Like applique

622
00:33:20,128 --> 00:33:22,176
Control

623
00:33:22,432 --> 00:33:24,736
What is the preferable system

624
00:33:24,992 --> 00:33:27,808
Doesn't realize how easy that would be

625
00:33:28,064 --> 00:33:29,344
To turn into like

626
00:33:30,112 --> 00:33:36,256
Exactly what we talked about over and over again we're above the law

627
00:33:36,512 --> 00:33:39,584
On a

628
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:40,864
But also what

629
00:33:41,376 --> 00:33:41,888
Expressing is

630
00:33:42,144 --> 00:33:42,656
Is that

631
00:33:42,912 --> 00:33:43,680
As long as

632
00:33:43,936 --> 00:33:45,984
They're not asking us to do anything inappropriate

633
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,776
It really doesn't matter what our

634
00:33:48,032 --> 00:33:48,544
Right

635
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,336
We exist as Arendt

636
00:33:53,152 --> 00:33:58,016
Yes what it is absolute is beyond the law

637
00:34:01,344 --> 00:34:01,856
As far as I know

638
00:34:02,112 --> 00:34:04,160
Has the Federal Reserve

639
00:34:04,416 --> 00:34:08,256
Whoever has

640
00:34:08,512 --> 00:34:09,536
Mommy nationalized

641
00:34:09,792 --> 00:34:11,584
Is going there and find out

642
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:12,352
The order

643
00:34:12,608 --> 00:34:13,632
Who's real quick

644
00:34:13,888 --> 00:34:15,424
Just keep in mind

645
00:34:16,192 --> 00:34:20,800
We are going to nationalize the Federal Reserve

646
00:34:22,336 --> 00:34:23,872
Who engaged in corruption

647
00:34:26,688 --> 00:34:28,480
The volcker to Greenspan

648
00:34:30,272 --> 00:34:30,784
And so forth

649
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:37,184
Barragan

650
00:34:52,288 --> 00:34:58,432
The founding of the Federal Reserve

651
00:34:58,688 --> 00:34:59,968
Is there a back under Woodrow

652
00:35:01,248 --> 00:35:02,016
The Federal Reserve is

653
00:35:02,272 --> 00:35:02,784
Struck out

654
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:04,832
Three times they didn't stop procrastinating

655
00:35:05,088 --> 00:35:05,600
1829

656
00:35:05,856 --> 00:35:07,392
Didn't stop the banking panic

657
00:35:08,672 --> 00:35:09,184
1833

658
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,720
And now they are

659
00:35:10,976 --> 00:35:12,512
Of the derivative

660
00:35:12,768 --> 00:35:14,304
What is it about Obama

661
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:15,840
Derivative

662
00:35:16,096 --> 00:35:16,608
Greenspan

663
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:18,656
So I want to be fair Tuesday

664
00:35:19,424 --> 00:35:22,496
Depressed but it is

665
00:35:22,752 --> 00:35:28,896
Supposedly about the people behind the scenes llamas puppet

666
00:35:29,152 --> 00:35:32,992
Federal Reserve

667
00:35:33,504 --> 00:35:37,856
Very foundational misunderstandings that they have about what the Federal Reserve is

668
00:35:38,112 --> 00:35:40,160
Right.

669
00:35:40,416 --> 00:35:42,720
What the history of the Federal Reserve

670
00:35:43,488 --> 00:35:44,512
What

671
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:47,840
People have said about centralized Banks

672
00:35:48,096 --> 00:35:49,632
Fabricated

673
00:35:49,888 --> 00:35:54,752
Right now in this case saying that the Federal Reserve is evil and must go because

674
00:35:55,264 --> 00:35:56,032
Failed to stop

675
00:35:56,288 --> 00:35:57,824
Crashes and maybe cause 1

676
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:59,360
Over the course of 100

677
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:01,152
5 years since I've been in.

678
00:36:01,408 --> 00:36:01,920
Like around

679
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:03,712
I mean

680
00:36:03,968 --> 00:36:06,016
He's not making a serious talk

681
00:36:06,528 --> 00:36:08,064
If that's what you bring to the table

682
00:36:11,392 --> 00:36:12,160
Number of crash

683
00:36:13,184 --> 00:36:13,952
Ed Financial

684
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:15,232
Occurred

685
00:36:15,488 --> 00:36:16,000
Prior

686
00:36:16,512 --> 00:36:17,792
The Federal Reserve

687
00:36:18,048 --> 00:36:19,072
To think about the exact

688
00:36:19,584 --> 00:36:21,376
Number because it's it's nebula

689
00:36:23,424 --> 00:36:25,728
A lot of different sources will give you a lot of different

690
00:36:25,984 --> 00:36:31,616
Regional

691
00:36:31,872 --> 00:36:34,176
Big probably Panic Within

692
00:36:35,712 --> 00:36:36,992
Yeah freshen like

693
00:36:40,064 --> 00:36:43,904
Massachusetts is fine and Main

694
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:47,744
Yeah 1913 was one of constant chaos

695
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:48,512
The crashes happen

696
00:36:50,816 --> 00:36:51,840
In the 20s

697
00:36:52,096 --> 00:36:52,608
3 years

698
00:36:52,864 --> 00:36:54,912
Stream for 1907

699
00:36:55,424 --> 00:36:57,728
The economy was basically in a constant state of

700
00:36:57,984 --> 00:36:59,008
Prescient

701
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:05,152
The myth of the financial Paradise that was uprooted

702
00:37:05,408 --> 00:37:06,432
By the grace of the Federal Reserve

703
00:37:06,688 --> 00:37:08,224
Exactly that it's a myth

704
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:11,040
It's told around campfires by paranoid anti-government proper

705
00:37:11,808 --> 00:37:14,624
I have no vested interest in the Federal Reserve exist

706
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:15,904
I don't give a s***

707
00:37:16,416 --> 00:37:18,208
I think it's done a good job but if it didn't

708
00:37:18,464 --> 00:37:18,976
Obito

709
00:37:20,256 --> 00:37:21,280
I looked into these things

710
00:37:22,816 --> 00:37:23,840
I'll be on their side

711
00:37:24,096 --> 00:37:25,888
And I will tell you that like I would say

712
00:37:29,472 --> 00:37:31,520
Honestly at this point in my research

713
00:37:31,776 --> 00:37:33,312
This stuff I'm close to

714
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:34,592
Fed Up

715
00:37:37,408 --> 00:37:37,920
F*** you

716
00:37:46,368 --> 00:37:47,904
Nogalitos nothing

717
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:50,464
Department

718
00:37:51,488 --> 00:37:52,000
I love you Dad

719
00:37:53,024 --> 00:37:54,048
Currency in credit

720
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:55,584
They're the ones that are cut off

721
00:37:57,632 --> 00:37:58,912
Economy

722
00:37:59,424 --> 00:38:00,192
Then they cut it off

723
00:38:01,216 --> 00:38:01,984
Under the song

724
00:38:05,056 --> 00:38:06,080
Toddler doing right now

725
00:38:08,896 --> 00:38:10,944
Bring those out

726
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,736
So frustrating

727
00:38:13,248 --> 00:38:14,528
So clearly

728
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:17,088
This happens in so many conversations

729
00:38:17,344 --> 00:38:20,672
Where you're talking to somebody and they're saying s*** like that no likes

730
00:38:20,928 --> 00:38:21,696
Okay

731
00:38:21,952 --> 00:38:27,072
You know two things and you know nothing else and none of that provides any context to what

732
00:38:27,328 --> 00:38:29,632
You're saying and you're just wasting my f******

733
00:38:29,888 --> 00:38:32,704
You know two things right

734
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:46,784
Traces back to the fraudulent story

735
00:38:47,808 --> 00:38:48,320
Diesel Secret

736
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:51,392
Nevada

737
00:38:51,648 --> 00:38:52,928
So you could buy it all up for

738
00:38:53,696 --> 00:38:59,584
Like we know Alex believes that story is true he's expressed it on multiple occasions

739
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:01,888
He talks about it all the time it's not true

740
00:39:02,656 --> 00:39:06,240
It's hard not to be here in

741
00:39:06,752 --> 00:39:08,800
That's just an archetype of how do you think

742
00:39:09,056 --> 00:39:09,568
These

743
00:39:09,824 --> 00:39:10,336
Globalist

744
00:39:10,592 --> 00:39:11,104
Quotes

745
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:12,128
They work

746
00:39:15,968 --> 00:39:16,480
Reply

747
00:39:16,736 --> 00:39:17,248
That way

748
00:39:17,504 --> 00:39:19,552
Not what I hear

749
00:39:19,808 --> 00:39:20,832
There's

750
00:39:21,088 --> 00:39:25,184
By the way

751
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:28,256
It just seems like that's the archetype

752
00:39:28,512 --> 00:39:29,792
What you think the mo is

753
00:39:30,048 --> 00:39:31,840
But that's just based on nothing

754
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:34,656
I don't know what to do

755
00:39:35,168 --> 00:39:35,936
Except to say

756
00:39:39,008 --> 00:39:42,080
It was actually built out of the blood

757
00:39:47,456 --> 00:39:50,272
Economy going but they're hoarding the money

758
00:39:50,528 --> 00:39:52,576
Buying up other Banks

759
00:39:52,832 --> 00:39:53,856
Find a Pinterest

760
00:39:56,928 --> 00:39:57,696
Defense contractor

761
00:39:59,488 --> 00:40:00,512
Logan economy

762
00:40:00,768 --> 00:40:01,280
By cutting off

763
00:40:01,536 --> 00:40:02,304
Credit

764
00:40:02,816 --> 00:40:04,864
And then once things really called hello

765
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:06,144
Hello because then

766
00:40:06,656 --> 00:40:07,680
Play Barbie thing up

767
00:40:07,936 --> 00:40:09,472
And start been putting more money

768
00:40:09,728 --> 00:40:10,496

Comes out the road I'm in the world that God can

The foreign arms

775
00:40:23,552 --> 00:40:25,344
These are the people who claim to be

776
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:28,672
The saviors of the economy the people who created every important

777

Prices

778
00:40:29,696 --> 00:40:34,048
In the past

779
00:40:34,304 --> 00:40:35,840
And it's a failure

780
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:38,656
Right now

781
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:45,824
I don't know what part of the Constitution

782
00:40:48,384 --> 00:40:49,920

Discuss

784
00:41:04,768 --> 00:41:07,328
It was like

785
00:41:07,584 --> 00:41:10,912
It's unconstitutional.

786
00:41:13,728 --> 00:41:16,032
For all of the people carry around like a

787
00:41:16,288 --> 00:41:19,872
Okay Constitution never actually

788
00:41:20,384 --> 00:41:23,200
I don't know it's the same as people who read those like

789
00:41:23,712 --> 00:41:29,600
New modern language versions of the Bible

790
00:41:29,856 --> 00:41:34,976
I'll make it really modern that we got an updated to live for the kids

791
00:41:35,232 --> 00:41:38,560

804
00:42:13,375 --> 00:42:14,655
It is really funny to look at

805
00:42:14,911 --> 00:42:16,191
The faces of people around it

806
00:42:16,447 --> 00:42:22,591
Leaderboard

807
00:42:22,847 --> 00:42:24,639

Into the middle distance

809
00:42:29,759 --> 00:42:31,039
Listening to him talk

810
00:42:32,063 --> 00:42:36,671
Don't really want to be here also if you look at this crowd this probably one non-white

Mail

812
00:42:39,487 --> 00:42:40,767
A non-white male symbol

813
00:42:41,535 --> 00:42:42,815
I think you're reflecting back

814
00:42:43,071 --> 00:42:48,191
2 hours ago when we saw it behind

815
00:42:48,447 --> 00:42:49,215
Yeah nevermind

816
00:42:49,471 --> 00:42:49,983

The Communist also do it

Vertically integrated

00:43:16,863 --> 00:43:17,631
He doesn't exist

Look at it

833
00:43:25,823 --> 00:43:28,383
Doing good here for a second

834
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:29,663
Because this is all

835
00:43:29,919 --> 00:43:32,991
Just like four so far it's just been Alex Turtle rambling about nothing

836
00:43:33,247 --> 00:43:36,575
This is a lot of words with nothing else going

837
00:43:36,831 --> 00:43:37,599
To prove a lot of

838
00:43:38,111 --> 00:43:38,623
Thanks

839
00:43:41,439 --> 00:43:42,719
Is about Communist Manifesto

840
00:43:45,535 --> 00:43:46,047
First Central Bank

841
00:43:46,303 --> 00:43:50,143
Do they advocate for a private Central Bank

842
00:43:50,399 --> 00:43:53,727
I really don't think that marks was into private

843
00:43:54,751 --> 00:43:55,519
State-run

844
00:43:56,031 --> 00:44:01,151
Nationalized Central Bank

845
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:04,479
Central Bank of credit

846
00:44:04,735 --> 00:44:08,319
In the hands of the state by means of the National Bank with state capital and

847
00:44:08,575 --> 00:44:09,599
Exclusive Monopoly

848
00:44:10,111 --> 00:44:11,135
That's one of the matters

849
00:44:12,671 --> 00:44:13,183
These

850
00:44:14,975 --> 00:44:18,815
Now I would like to quote Webster Tarpley from earlier in this documentary

851
00:44:19,071 --> 00:44:23,935
One of the first things we got to do a nationalized the FED is go in there and find out the audit

852
00:44:24,191 --> 00:44:26,239
Webster Tarpley is a commie

853
00:44:27,007 --> 00:44:33,151
Advocating for nationalizing the central bank

854
00:44:33,407 --> 00:44:39,551
Good ideas are good I do not

855
00:44:39,807 --> 00:44:41,855
Realize that that's in his documentary

856
00:44:42,879 --> 00:44:44,159
Playing about the idea

857
00:44:45,183 --> 00:44:47,743
This Communist Manifesto talks about Central

858
00:44:47,999 --> 00:44:48,767
Contact

859
00:44:49,023 --> 00:44:49,535
It does

860
00:44:49,791 --> 00:44:51,583
Is the exact same as what

861
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:53,375
Right

862
00:44:53,887 --> 00:44:58,239
Central banks have existed since the Dutch started getting creative in the 1600

863
00:44:58,751 --> 00:45:01,567
It's not an idea that was created by the Communist Manifesto

864
00:45:01,823 --> 00:45:03,871
I like I like

865
00:45:05,663 --> 00:45:10,527
Play life like a little

866
00:45:10,783 --> 00:45:16,927
Maybe a little bit

867
00:45:17,439 --> 00:45:22,815
There is early 1600s

868
00:45:23,071 --> 00:45:25,887
It started to come together a little bit to me that like

869
00:45:26,143 --> 00:45:29,727
The nascent idea was

870
00:45:29,983 --> 00:45:30,751
The first

871
00:45:31,007 --> 00:45:31,519
Sort of like

872
00:45:31,775 --> 00:45:34,847
Universally accepted Central Bank was also the Dutch

873
00:45:35,103 --> 00:45:39,455
I thought maybe they would come up with the idea and then someone else would improve on concept they're like

874
00:45:39,711 --> 00:45:40,479
Not suck it

875
00:45:42,527 --> 00:45:45,343
Not going to be 100%

876
00:45:47,903 --> 00:45:48,415
But

877
00:45:48,671 --> 00:45:52,511
I'm very worried if I do remember

878
00:45:52,767 --> 00:45:53,791
Get racist about the judge

879
00:45:54,047 --> 00:45:59,935
No no like the way that European history goes it's like

880
00:46:00,703 --> 00:46:04,031
People say that the Dutch were the first people to have a central bank

881
00:46:04,543 --> 00:46:05,311
And I do.

882
00:46:06,591 --> 00:46:09,151
Modern

883
00:46:09,407 --> 00:46:10,175
The West

884
00:46:10,431 --> 00:46:12,223
That's true but if I

885
00:46:12,479 --> 00:46:12,991
I really do

886
00:46:13,247 --> 00:46:15,295
I should tell you that they're reserved

887
00:46:15,551 --> 00:46:16,063
With wooden shoes

888
00:46:16,575 --> 00:46:20,927
So

889
00:46:21,951 --> 00:46:22,719
Use that language anymore

890
00:46:23,999 --> 00:46:29,119
I understand

891
00:46:33,727 --> 00:46:38,847
Wasn't introduced by The Communist Manifesto

892
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:45,247
That nationalized

893
00:46:45,503 --> 00:46:46,015
Pillar

894
00:46:52,671 --> 00:46:55,487
He's talking about wrote The Communist Manifesto or behind

895
00:46:55,999 --> 00:46:57,023
Although

896
00:47:02,143 --> 00:47:02,911
No I know

897
00:47:03,167 --> 00:47:06,495
It just like that sort of Declaration it seems like

898
00:47:06,751 --> 00:47:08,799
Flippantly throwing around 8

899
00:47:09,311 --> 00:47:11,359
But the reasons if your a new list

900
00:47:14,175 --> 00:47:14,687
Experience with

901
00:47:14,943 --> 00:47:15,455
Awesome Alex

902
00:47:16,223 --> 00:47:16,735
We have

903
00:47:16,991 --> 00:47:18,015
Several hundred episodes

904
00:47:18,271 --> 00:47:22,879
Proving definitively

905
00:47:23,391 --> 00:47:23,903
Not like

906
00:47:24,159 --> 00:47:25,183
Like deeply influenced by

907
00:47:27,231 --> 00:47:29,023
But the reason at this one strikes

908
00:47:29,535 --> 00:47:30,559
Particularly

909
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:32,351
Is that

910
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:34,911
Like I can't find any evidence

911
00:47:35,935 --> 00:47:36,447
And

912
00:47:36,959 --> 00:47:37,471
I again

913
00:47:39,007 --> 00:47:39,519
So like

914
00:47:39,775 --> 00:47:40,543
I can't

915
00:47:40,799 --> 00:47:41,567
Go to

916
00:47:41,823 --> 00:47:42,847
He's like

917
00:47:45,407 --> 00:47:47,967
Historical resources about the writing of

918
00:47:48,223 --> 00:47:49,247
The Communist Manifesto

919
00:47:49,759 --> 00:47:50,271
Marxist

920
00:47:53,855 --> 00:47:54,879
Documents

921
00:47:55,391 --> 00:47:57,439
Victor

922
00:47:57,695 --> 00:47:58,207
There were

923
00:47:58,463 --> 00:48:00,255
Unnamed

924
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:05,375
Hit were around somewhere

925
00:48:05,631 --> 00:48:06,911
So he's going to move the gold

926
00:48:08,703 --> 00:48:09,471
Anti-Semitic

927
00:48:09,727 --> 00:48:10,495
Is because

928
00:48:10,751 --> 00:48:14,847
That like I said I can't I don't think it's true I don't see any

929
00:48:15,103 --> 00:48:16,895
That's true and the Patriots

930
00:48:17,151 --> 00:48:18,687
Absolutely chock-a-block

931
00:48:18,943 --> 00:48:20,991
With people who believe that bankers

932
00:48:21,503 --> 00:48:22,271
Arduous

933
00:48:22,527 --> 00:48:23,039
Conspiracy

934
00:48:23,295 --> 00:48:25,087
And with people who believe that

935
00:48:25,343 --> 00:48:26,367
Communism is this

936
00:48:27,391 --> 00:48:30,719
To the idea that Alex is suggesting that Bankers were Bhai

937
00:48:30,975 --> 00:48:32,511
Hi communism all alone

938
00:48:32,767 --> 00:48:33,279
Is it weird

939
00:48:33,535 --> 00:48:35,839
Influence of those two beliefs that are very

940
00:48:36,095 --> 00:48:38,143
3 prevalent and right

941
00:48:38,399 --> 00:48:39,679
That intersection

942
00:48:39,935 --> 00:48:40,703
Doesn't seem like a coincidence

943
00:48:41,215 --> 00:48:41,727
No

944
00:48:41,983 --> 00:48:43,775
It's it's it's very trouble

945
00:48:44,031 --> 00:48:47,359
The the thing that I think about with anti-Semitic

946
00:48:47,615 --> 00:48:48,127
Underpin

947
00:48:48,639 --> 00:48:49,151
So much of

948
00:48:51,455 --> 00:48:51,967
And not always

949
00:48:52,223 --> 00:48:54,783
Because a lot of times it literally is straight-up

950
00:48:56,319 --> 00:48:56,831
Richer

951
00:48:57,087 --> 00:48:59,903
The thing that I think about is whether or not there

952
00:49:00,415 --> 00:49:01,695
Anti-Semitic

953
00:49:02,719 --> 00:49:03,487
If they recognize

954
00:49:03,743 --> 00:49:06,815
How effective this anti-semitic propaganda has been against

955
00:49:07,071 --> 00:49:08,351
On account of

956
00:49:08,607 --> 00:49:12,447
Several thousand years of people getting one

957
00:49:12,959 --> 00:49:14,751
Propaganda about Jews and then

958
00:49:15,007 --> 00:49:21,151
All the programs in jail break

959
00:49:23,967 --> 00:49:27,295
Whatever

960
00:49:32,159 --> 00:49:33,439
What's granola

961
00:49:33,695 --> 00:49:36,511
The game

That Chiron was played underneath Alex Jones

1007

1009
00:52:16,767 --> 00:52:21,119
Should be

1010
00:52:21,375 --> 00:52:23,423

1056
00:54:26,047 --> 00:54:32,191
Great question

1057
00:54:32,447 --> 00:54:33,215

Spears what do you want to live in a world where you can't watch

00:54:43,711 --> 00:54:49,087
I know that the world that I've created for myself as one where I constantly watch Alex

1062
00:54:49,343 --> 00:54:53,183
But yes I would like to live in a world where I would love that

1063
00:54:53,439 --> 00:54:55,231
Good thing that's most

1064
00:54:55,487 --> 00:54:57,791
Tell me about bees

1065
00:54:59,583 --> 00:55:01,887
Issues that I have with it is

1066
00:55:04,959 --> 00:55:06,495
I can't imagine a scenario where it's at

1067
00:55:08,031 --> 00:55:08,543
I mean

1068
00:55:09,311 --> 00:55:09,823
So whatever

1069
00:55:10,335 --> 00:55:11,103
But I I

1070
00:55:11,871 --> 00:55:12,383
Can't imagine

1071
00:55:12,639 --> 00:55:13,919
Watching this documentary

1072
00:55:18,271 --> 00:55:18,783
Emphasize

1073
00:55:24,159 --> 00:55:26,207
Because they don't have the internet

1074

Right it's crazy

1075
00:55:37,983 --> 00:55:39,007
So here's the problem

1076
00:55:39,263 --> 00:55:41,823
That I think Alex is correctly address

1077
00:55:42,591 --> 00:55:45,919
If you he's not get money off this

1078
00:55:46,175 --> 00:55:47,455
If you were to send somebody a lynx

1079
00:55:48,223 --> 00:55:52,831
And they weren't already interested they would watch two minutes

1080
00:55:53,343 --> 00:55:53,855
Right

1081
00:55:54,111 --> 00:55:56,415
But if you have a DVD copy

1082
00:55:56,927 --> 00:55:58,207

1083
00:55:58,719 --> 00:55:59,231

00:56:18,687 --> 00:56:19,967
Youtube.com

1089
00:56:20,223 --> 00:56:26,367
Alice's getting money

A very powerful

1153
00:59:42,719 --> 00:59:43,231
Football

1154
00:59:43,999 --> 00:59:44,511
Assassination

1155
00:59:45,023 --> 00:59:45,535
Kennedy

1156
00:59:46,559 --> 00:59:47,071
And the others

1157
00:59:47,583 --> 00:59:48,095
Father

1158
00:59:48,351 --> 00:59:49,119
Beginning of the Vietnam

1159
00:59:50,399 --> 00:59:50,911
Beginning

1160
00:59:51,423 --> 00:59:52,191
Absolute domination

1161
00:59:52,447 --> 00:59:52,959
The Wall Street

1162
00:59:53,215 --> 00:59:53,983
Poop over every other

1163
00:59:54,751 --> 00:59:55,519
Nobody else counts

1164
00:59:55,775 --> 00:59:56,287
Except

1165
00:59:56,543 --> 00:59:57,311
The Wall Street money man

1166
00:59:58,079 --> 00:59:59,615
United States

1167
00:59:59,871 --> 01:00:00,383
Into

1168
01:00:02,175 --> 01:00:02,943
For progress but something

1169
01:00:04,479 --> 01:00:04,991
Destruction

1170
01:00:05,247 --> 01:00:07,551
That doesn't need to remain that way

1171
01:00:08,063 --> 01:00:09,343
The interests of the American people is

1172
01:00:09,599 --> 01:00:11,135
The fight to take your government back for

1173
01:00:11,391 --> 01:00:11,903
From Wall Street

1174
01:00:12,159 --> 01:00:13,183
And make the United States

1175
01:00:13,439 --> 01:00:13,951
The forest

1176
01:00:15,999 --> 01:00:16,767
Easily could do

1177
01:00:17,279 --> 01:00:17,791
If we could just break

1178
01:00:18,047 --> 01:00:18,559
The power of

1179
01:00:18,815 --> 01:00:19,583
Of the people behind up on

1180
01:00:20,351 --> 01:00:23,167
Do you think break the power of the people behind Obama

1181
01:00:23,423 --> 01:00:23,935
But

1182
01:00:24,191 --> 01:00:26,495
There's nothing substantiv there at all and

1183
01:00:26,751 --> 01:00:27,263
Terms of

1184
01:00:27,775 --> 01:00:31,359
Prescriptions for Pat's forward there is nothing

1185
01:00:31,615 --> 01:00:32,895
At the things that

1186
01:00:34,431 --> 01:00:36,479
Guitar player Alex or any of the people who are

1187
01:00:36,735 --> 01:00:37,247
The

1188
01:00:38,015 --> 01:00:43,647
Supposed experts that are in the documentary there's nothing that they're advocating for that is outside of just like

1189
01:00:44,671 --> 01:00:49,791
F*** all this there's nothing really to

1190
01:00:50,047 --> 01:00:53,375
I mean I guess they would probably argue that audit the Fed

1191
01:00:53,887 --> 01:00:54,399
Is constructive

1192
01:00:54,655 --> 01:00:56,703
Not recognizing besides audit all the time

1193
01:00:57,215 --> 01:00:59,263
Destroyed affair.

1194
01:00:59,775 --> 01:01:00,799
Productive

1195
01:01:01,055 --> 01:01:07,199
Let's just go with what that motherfuker said my boys spider tarps

1196
01:01:07,455 --> 01:01:09,247
Motherfuker

1197
01:01:09,503 --> 01:01:14,623
Like oh I'm Erica could easily be a positive force for the world

1198
01:01:14,879 --> 01:01:15,391
Exactly

1199
01:01:15,647 --> 01:01:21,791
Everything you said so far

1200
01:01:22,047 --> 01:01:26,911
You want America to be a giant shitbag s******* all over the rest of the world same time

1201
01:01:27,167 --> 01:01:27,679
Deeply

1202
01:01:28,447 --> 01:01:29,727
Relieved

1203
01:01:32,031 --> 01:01:32,799
To accept Trump

1204
01:01:38,431 --> 01:01:39,455
Except

1205
01:01:40,735 --> 01:01:41,247
At least he doesn't

1206
01:01:45,087 --> 01:01:46,623
You know like it Italy

1207
01:01:46,879 --> 01:01:47,903
The window

1208
01:01:48,159 --> 01:01:48,671
Is that

1209
01:01:48,927 --> 01:01:49,951
We should

1210
01:01:50,463 --> 01:01:50,975
Luke

1211
01:01:51,231 --> 01:01:51,743
Iran

1212
01:01:51,999 --> 01:01:53,023
But other than that

1213
01:01:53,279 --> 01:01:54,047
We will be fine

1214
01:01:54,303 --> 01:01:55,839
We don't know that for sure

1215
01:01:57,887 --> 01:01:58,399
Probably

1216
01:01:59,679 --> 01:02:00,959
They all love

1217
01:02:01,727 --> 01:02:04,287
I don't know

1218
01:02:04,543 --> 01:02:10,687
I never know what it is with these guys and their misunderstanding of the history of Iran Iraq

1219
01:02:10,943 --> 01:02:17,087
Whether or not they know they're different countries.

1220
01:02:17,343 --> 01:02:23,487
Ever ask them to define the difference between Shiite

1221
01:02:27,839 --> 01:02:30,399
He's gone into it on his show before

1222
01:02:32,703 --> 01:02:35,007
Would like blissfully ignorant

1223
01:02:35,263 --> 01:02:35,775
He does

1224
01:02:37,055 --> 01:02:37,823
He changed his position

1225
01:02:38,079 --> 01:02:38,847
Means like

1226
01:02:41,663 --> 01:02:42,175
Making a

1227
01:02:42,687 --> 01:02:43,711
Choice

1228
01:02:43,967 --> 01:02:45,247
Winner

1229
01:02:46,783 --> 01:02:48,063
America being awesome

1230
01:02:48,575 --> 01:02:50,879
You're right like it that's that's also

1231
01:02:51,391 --> 01:02:52,159
Everything is

1232
01:02:52,671 --> 01:02:53,439
It's all

1233
01:02:54,207 --> 01:02:55,743
And just in service of

1234
01:02:56,511 --> 01:02:57,535
This s***'s bad

1235
01:02:58,303 --> 01:03:03,935
We should do better whatever the guy I don't like a guy

1236
01:03:04,191 --> 01:03:04,703
Impart

1237
01:03:06,495 --> 01:03:08,543
It doesn't matter if you're Democrat or Republican

1238
01:03:08,799 --> 01:03:09,567
This is non-partisan

1239
01:03:14,687 --> 01:03:17,503
This is purely non-partisan

1240
01:03:18,015 --> 01:03:18,527
Racial

1241
01:03:20,319 --> 01:03:21,343
Wheel of white

1242
01:03:21,855 --> 01:03:27,999
The First Take

1243
01:03:31,583 --> 01:03:33,887
The main Banks

1244
01:03:34,143 --> 01:03:34,655
Severe up which

1245
01:03:34,911 --> 01:03:35,935
For started by Adam wise

1246
01:03:36,959 --> 01:03:37,471
In Racha

1247
01:03:39,519 --> 01:03:41,311
This is a big problem

1248
01:03:41,567 --> 01:03:42,335
Adam Vice

1249
01:03:43,615 --> 01:03:45,663
He's the guy who started the Illuminati

1250
01:03:46,175 --> 01:03:46,687
Yeah

1251
01:03:47,199 --> 01:03:48,735
Yeah you started goddamn

1252
01:03:55,391 --> 01:03:58,463
Is it from 1776 until 1785

1253
01:03:58,975 --> 01:04:00,767
And then was disbanded because I was like

1254
01:04:01,023 --> 01:04:01,535
F****** stop

1255
01:04:04,863 --> 01:04:05,887
He had nothing to do with banks

1256
01:04:07,167 --> 01:04:08,191
He was trained as a lawyer

1257
01:04:11,263 --> 01:04:13,055
Covid-19

1258
01:04:13,311 --> 01:04:15,615
Free is coming in here and expressing his ideas

1259
01:04:15,871 --> 01:04:17,663
And the Rothschilds started

1260
01:04:19,711 --> 01:04:20,479
I know where he's getting

1261
01:04:21,247 --> 01:04:26,879
Where is the 1991 book that was written by

1262
01:04:27,391 --> 01:04:28,159
Pat Buchanan

1263
01:04:28,671 --> 01:04:29,951
Call Javon New World Order

1264
01:04:30,207 --> 01:04:36,095
No

1265
01:04:36,351 --> 01:04:40,191
Wait Pat Robertson

1266
01:04:44,287 --> 01:04:48,383
Then I meant

1267
01:04:50,943 --> 01:04:55,039
Crew from SNL

1268
01:04:55,295 --> 01:04:58,623
Right

1269
01:05:02,463 --> 01:05:04,767
Patrick

1270
01:05:05,791 --> 01:05:07,839
I know that this probably comes

1271
01:05:08,095 --> 01:05:09,887
From reading that book because

1272
01:05:12,447 --> 01:05:13,215
Horses that

1273
01:05:15,519 --> 01:05:16,031
Look into it and find

1274
01:05:17,055 --> 01:05:17,567
Those books

1275
01:05:17,823 --> 01:05:19,615
They were mostly

1276
01:05:20,127 --> 01:05:20,639
Like

1277
01:05:21,407 --> 01:05:21,919
The protocols

1278
01:05:24,991 --> 01:05:27,807
The arguments that was made in Pat Robertson

1279
01:05:28,831 --> 01:05:30,111
Was that

1280
01:05:32,927 --> 01:05:36,767
You can use

1281
01:05:37,279 --> 01:05:40,863
Dispenser

1282
01:05:42,911 --> 01:05:45,471
Pat Buchanan was making the argument that

1283
01:05:45,727 --> 01:05:46,751
Adams

1284
01:05:48,031 --> 01:05:48,543
Right

1285
01:05:48,799 --> 01:05:53,151
History shows that

1286
01:05:53,919 --> 01:05:54,943
When history stairs

1287
01:05:55,711 --> 01:05:57,247
That the order was disbanded

1288
01:05:58,015 --> 01:05:58,783
In fact

1289
01:05:59,039 --> 01:06:00,575
They went under Underground

1290
01:06:01,087 --> 01:06:02,111
And they met

1291
01:06:02,879 --> 01:06:04,159
Collaborated with

1292
01:06:04,927 --> 01:06:06,719
European Jewish bankers

1293
01:06:06,975 --> 01:06:13,119
Collaboration

1294
01:06:13,375 --> 01:06:14,655
Does the CFR and that's

1295
01:06:15,167 --> 01:06:15,679
So that's

1296
01:06:15,935 --> 01:06:16,447
The piece of Pappy

1297
01:06:16,703 --> 01:06:17,471
Buchanan's

1298
01:06:17,727 --> 01:06:22,335
Literary career

1299
01:06:24,895 --> 01:06:25,407
Alex Jones

1300
01:06:26,431 --> 01:06:27,199
You've given credit

1301
01:06:27,711 --> 01:06:29,247
But I think there's a lot of sources

1302
01:06:29,503 --> 01:06:31,039
Before it that are much more

1303
01:06:31,295 --> 01:06:32,319
Yeah

1304
01:06:32,575 --> 01:06:33,599
That we pay attention

1305
01:06:34,879 --> 01:06:37,439
Comes up here is because George Humphreys

1306
01:06:37,695 --> 01:06:39,231
Clearly expressed

1307
01:06:39,487 --> 01:06:40,255
Adam B

1308
01:06:40,511 --> 01:06:41,279
Was involved with

1309
01:06:42,303 --> 01:06:44,095
I'm like starting

1310
01:06:44,351 --> 01:06:45,631
He brings up the Rothschild

1311
01:06:45,887 --> 01:06:47,935
Yeah I do to me when I hear that like

1312
01:06:48,191 --> 01:06:48,703
Jose

1313
01:06:48,959 --> 01:06:50,239
The only real connection

1314
01:06:50,751 --> 01:06:51,263
I really

1315
01:06:52,799 --> 01:06:54,079
A device of a

1316
01:06:54,335 --> 01:06:54,847
Thinking

1317
01:06:55,103 --> 01:06:56,639
Betty does

1318
01:06:57,663 --> 01:06:58,175
Anyway

1319
01:07:02,015 --> 01:07:03,295
Have all fine

1320
01:07:03,807 --> 01:07:04,319
The Messianic

1321
01:07:06,111 --> 01:07:06,623
Warleader

1322
01:07:07,135 --> 01:07:07,647
The last two under

1323
01:07:09,439 --> 01:07:09,951
Polian

1324
01:07:10,463 --> 01:07:11,231
Lenin

1325
01:07:11,743 --> 01:07:12,511
200 years

1326
01:07:12,767 --> 01:07:13,279
Darling

1327
01:07:16,095 --> 01:07:16,863
Adolf Hitler

1328
01:07:20,447 --> 01:07:21,215
Franklin Delano

1329
01:07:21,471 --> 01:07:21,983
Roosevelt

1330
01:07:23,007 --> 01:07:23,775
Stocking right now

1331
01:07:25,567 --> 01:07:26,079
Barack

1332
01:07:26,847 --> 01:07:27,871
Haircut

1333
01:07:28,383 --> 01:07:29,663
He should get a haircut

1334
01:07:29,919 --> 01:07:32,223
This is the perfect example of one of these things

1335
01:07:32,479 --> 01:07:34,015
Complaining about earlier but the idea

1336
01:07:34,271 --> 01:07:36,831
These people just make extravagant a historical claim

1337
01:07:37,343 --> 01:07:38,111
And then if you're like

1338
01:07:38,367 --> 01:07:38,879
No

1339
01:07:39,135 --> 01:07:39,903
Did I prove me wrong

1340
01:07:46,303 --> 01:07:47,839
Let it was independently wealthy

1341
01:07:49,375 --> 01:07:50,655
Biggest family was super rich

1342
01:07:50,911 --> 01:07:52,447
Independently wealthy because of the

1343
01:07:53,471 --> 01:07:53,983
Sure

1344
01:07:54,239 --> 01:08:00,383
You got it he gots the money from the Germans because the Germans wanted to have to go back to Russia when he was in Exile

1345
01:08:00,639 --> 01:08:02,175
How big is it

1346
01:08:02,687 --> 01:08:06,783
The USSR which was in their strategic interests but it wasn't

1347
01:08:07,039 --> 01:08:07,807
That much money

1348
01:08:08,063 --> 01:08:09,087
It was It was a pittance

1349
01:08:09,343 --> 01:08:10,111
Compared to

1350
01:08:10,367 --> 01:08:11,135
Yeah what

1351
01:08:11,391 --> 01:08:13,439
Had no reason to

1352
01:08:13,695 --> 01:08:14,719
Globalist money

1353
01:08:22,143 --> 01:08:28,287
Throw in all of the western history you possibly can because

1354
01:08:28,543 --> 01:08:29,823
About the history of

1355
01:08:30,079 --> 01:08:30,591
Anywhere

1356
01:08:33,919 --> 01:08:40,063
Stalin and Hitler

1357

During the global it's raining of Terror like what the f*** are you talk

1358
01:08:50,559 --> 01:08:56,191
My complaints about the State Historical

1359

Is that like

1360
01:08:58,239 --> 01:08:59,263
All of this

1361
01:09:00,287 --> 01:09:02,079
They don't even give a fuk

1362
01:09:02,335 --> 01:09:04,383
A bright any other history

1363
01:09:05,407 --> 01:09:06,175
Snow White

1364
01:09:06,943 --> 01:09:09,759
Who's shares a border with Russia

1365
01:09:10,527 --> 01:09:11,039
China

1366
01:09:11,551 --> 01:09:13,599
How old is China

1367
01:09:13,855 --> 01:09:15,903
Like are they real

1368
01:09:16,415 --> 01:09:22,559
Would you say that maybe those two histories or perhaps

1369
01:09:22,815 --> 01:09:28,959
Level that people should globalist Hitler globalist have to do with it

1370
01:09:29,215 --> 01:09:29,727
Genghis Khan

1371
01:09:32,031 --> 01:09:32,543
Whatever hookah

1372
01:09:32,799 --> 01:09:33,311
Gives a s***

1373
01:09:37,919 --> 01:09:39,199
Deeply salient

1374
01:09:40,991 --> 01:09:42,527
All of this history

1375
01:09:43,039 --> 01:09:46,623
Even their even their negative histories white people it's all white

1376
01:09:46,879 --> 01:09:50,975
Even their weird deeply conspiratorial a historical s*** is all like

1377
01:09:51,743 --> 01:09:53,023
Who gives a s***

1378
01:09:53,279 --> 01:09:55,327
About what non-white people were doing

1379
01:09:55,583 --> 01:10:00,191
The banking cartel has established a beachhead of 1913 to the Federal Reserve

1380
01:10:00,447 --> 01:10:03,775
1940 Chevrolet set up a little Shadow government

1381
01:10:04,031 --> 01:10:05,311
For the National Security

1382
01:10:07,871 --> 01:10:10,431
Burbot from 47 on

1383
01:10:10,943 --> 01:10:13,503
The National Security state began the long process

1384
01:10:14,015 --> 01:10:14,783
I'm absorbing

1385
01:10:15,039 --> 01:10:16,575
Federal and state bureaucracy

1386
01:10:17,087 --> 01:10:17,855
All the same time

1387
01:10:18,367 --> 01:10:20,415
Undermining the Constitutional power of congress

1388
01:10:20,671 --> 01:10:22,207
What

1389
01:10:25,791 --> 01:10:28,351
By controlling the issuance of currency and credit

1390
01:10:28,607 --> 01:10:30,655
The private Federal Reserve was able to buy up

1391
01:10:30,911 --> 01:10:32,191
Most of the Fortune 500

1392
01:10:33,215 --> 01:10:36,031
Whoa company wouldn't sell

1393
01:10:36,543 --> 01:10:40,127
The bankers would unleash Federal regulator to run them out of business

1394
01:10:40,895 --> 01:10:47,039
Anybody listening to this who knows anything in our in 10 minutes into the documentary

1395
01:10:47,295 --> 01:10:50,367
Turn it off earlier

1396
01:10:50,879 --> 01:10:52,159
Go fuc yourself

1397
01:10:52,671 --> 01:10:53,183
So

1398
01:10:53,439 --> 01:10:54,207
That crazy

1399
01:10:54,719 --> 01:10:58,047
The Federal Reserve is the Federal Reserve own most of the forts

1400
01:10:58,303 --> 01:10:59,071
500 companies

1401
01:10:59,583 --> 01:11:04,191
He said the Fortune 500 I don't think he recognizes that that's just a that that's a term

1402
01:11:04,447 --> 01:11:05,727
For like the 500 most

1403
01:11:06,751 --> 01:11:08,031
The profitable companies

1404
01:11:08,287 --> 01:11:09,567
Each year the list comes out

1405
01:11:09,823 --> 01:11:15,967
Including the

1406
01:11:17,247 --> 01:11:17,759
Guy

1407
01:11:18,271 --> 01:11:20,063
Federal Reserve

1408
01:11:21,855 --> 01:11:22,367
Sound right

1409
01:11:22,623 --> 01:11:28,767
He just said that they own all of the Fortune 500 or anybody

1410
01:11:30,815 --> 01:11:33,631
Warren

1411
01:11:33,887 --> 01:11:34,911
And knocked about a bit

1412
01:11:35,167 --> 01:11:35,935
What about nature

1413
01:11:36,191 --> 01:11:36,959
He was in the cut

1414
01:11:37,983 --> 01:11:39,519
Well good I hope you get this percent

1415
01:11:39,775 --> 01:11:40,543
Look

1416
01:11:41,055 --> 01:11:41,567
What is Alec

1417
01:11:42,079 --> 01:11:42,847
What is Alex

1418
01:11:48,735 --> 01:11:54,879
Tyranny of the American economy while like if he's if he's not like prison

1419
01:11:55,903 --> 01:12:00,255
He doesn't believe that I don't know

1420
01:12:00,767 --> 01:12:03,839
I'm not saying

1421
01:12:04,351 --> 01:12:10,495
Like where's the cutoff point for the Federal Reserve today only

1422
01:12:12,543 --> 01:12:17,407
Okay alright next year now that I know that now

1423
01:12:17,663 --> 01:12:19,455
He is not just making s*** up

1424
01:12:19,711 --> 01:12:20,479
Which spoiler alert

1425
01:12:20,991 --> 01:12:23,039
That would mean that the Federal Reserve owns

1426
01:12:23,295 --> 01:12:24,575
Walmart

1427
01:12:24,831 --> 01:12:30,975
Apple CVS Health Amazon AT&T Ford General Motors and everything all the way

1428
01:12:31,231 --> 01:12:33,535
We down to Yum brands and Western Union

1429
01:12:33,791 --> 01:12:36,863
Cuddledown

1430
01:12:37,119 --> 01:12:38,911
Are you saying that

1431
01:12:39,167 --> 01:12:39,935
Oh that makes

1432
01:12:40,191 --> 01:12:46,335
Krs-1 Burger King

1433
01:12:49,663 --> 01:12:50,175
Fair enough

1434
01:12:50,943 --> 01:12:51,455
Herberger's

1435
01:12:51,967 --> 01:12:53,503
Not touch the Bell beefer

1436
01:12:58,623 --> 01:12:59,903
Really saying that

1437
01:13:00,927 --> 01:13:02,719
Who owns

1438
01:13:03,231 --> 01:13:05,279
Because the chairman of the Federal Reserve

1439
01:13:05,791 --> 01:13:07,583
Is he saying that that's who owns it

1440
01:13:07,839 --> 01:13:12,191
Cuz that's a person is appointed by the president serves a

1441
01:13:12,447 --> 01:13:16,543
When is there an office they own all these companies is that

1442
01:13:17,567 --> 01:13:18,335
Now

1443
01:13:18,591 --> 01:13:21,407
This is where we're getting back to my earlier save

1444
01:13:21,663 --> 01:13:23,199
That it has to be some dude

1445
01:13:23,711 --> 01:13:24,223
Who's like

1446
01:13:24,735 --> 01:13:26,527
In the in the middle management

1447
01:13:27,807 --> 01:13:29,855
He's got to be he's got to be there

1448
01:13:30,111 --> 01:13:31,135
He's not appointed

1449
01:13:31,647 --> 01:13:33,183
He's not on

1450
01:13:36,511 --> 01:13:40,863
12 people who are relevant in the Federal Reserve

1451
01:13:41,119 --> 01:13:42,911
The owner of the Fortune 500

1452
01:13:43,423 --> 01:13:45,983
No that's not

1453
01:13:46,751 --> 01:13:50,847
Kevin the owner of the Fortune 500 companies put out the list

1454
01:13:51,359 --> 01:13:51,871
Yep

1455
01:13:53,151 --> 01:13:53,919
And he often isil

1456
01:13:56,223 --> 01:13:59,039
Legitimately if he sings like the chairperson

1457
01:13:59,295 --> 01:14:02,623
Federal Reserve

1458
01:14:02,879 --> 01:14:04,415
AR

1459
01:14:04,671 --> 01:14:05,951
Exorbitantly rich

1460
01:14:06,207 --> 01:14:09,791
Another term is over

1461
01:14:10,047 --> 01:14:11,071
They are no longer on it

1462
01:14:11,327 --> 01:14:12,095
But

1463
01:14:12,351 --> 01:14:14,911
Maybe that's not the case maybe he's the abstract

1464
01:14:15,167 --> 01:14:16,447
Dia of the board of God

1465
01:14:16,959 --> 01:14:17,727
Owns Aldi

1466
01:14:17,983 --> 01:14:18,495
These companies

1467
01:14:20,543 --> 01:14:22,335
Complete and utter

1468
01:14:23,103 --> 01:14:26,687
You know he's just praying that his viewers don't realize how stupid that sentence like

1469
01:14:26,943 --> 01:14:29,503
The Federal Reserve bought up the Fortune 500

1470
01:14:29,759 --> 01:14:32,063
Because if

1471
01:14:33,087 --> 01:14:34,879
If they don't

1472
01:14:35,135 --> 01:14:37,439
But if the board and all those companies

1473
01:14:37,951 --> 01:14:39,487
Then all of their profits

1474
01:14:39,743 --> 01:14:41,023
At the end of the year would go into the

1475
01:14:41,279 --> 01:14:41,791
Treachery

1476
01:14:42,047 --> 01:14:43,839
Feel like all right

1477
01:14:44,095 --> 01:14:47,167
To the government

1478
01:14:52,543 --> 01:14:58,687
Isn't rephrase the but that's what the government does have the problems of the government

1479
01:14:58,943 --> 01:15:00,479
Deeply in

1480
01:15:00,735 --> 01:15:06,879
Since 1933 if all the Fortune 500 companies profits are being funneled back into the treasury

1481
01:15:07,135 --> 01:15:11,487
Which they would have to be at the Federal Reserve

1482
01:15:11,999 --> 01:15:15,583
Vanoss

1483
01:15:15,839 --> 01:15:17,119
The point being

1484
01:15:17,631 --> 01:15:18,911
Alex

1485
01:15:19,935 --> 01:15:22,751
Does federal government is the richest

1486
01:15:23,007 --> 01:15:23,775
It is ever been

1487
01:15:24,287 --> 01:15:25,311
8 also bankrupt

1488
01:15:26,079 --> 01:15:28,127
And

1489
01:15:28,383 --> 01:15:31,199
Both simultaneously

1490
01:15:31,455 --> 01:15:32,479
But they can't afford any

1491
01:15:32,991 --> 01:15:33,759
Everything and nothing

1492
01:15:34,527 --> 01:15:37,343
All the prophets are there

1493
01:15:38,111 --> 01:15:38,879
They're running a death

1494
01:15:42,207 --> 01:15:42,975
What else is there

1495
01:15:43,487 --> 01:15:46,559
Oh they don't make anything and we need to reduce the size of government

1496
01:15:46,815 --> 01:15:50,655
And they should sell off the Fortune 50 should do they should

1497
01:15:50,911 --> 01:15:53,471
Sell off the Fortune 500 that they don't own

1498
01:15:53,727 --> 01:15:54,495
I don't know

1499
01:15:54,751 --> 01:15:56,031
I don't think so I think you should

1500
01:15:56,287 --> 01:15:58,079
Control

1501
01:15:58,335 --> 01:15:58,847
These companies

1502
01:16:01,663 --> 01:16:02,943
Here's the here's the deal

1503
01:16:03,199 --> 01:16:04,223
Like real talk

1504
01:16:04,479 --> 01:16:04,991
Big big

1505
01:16:05,503 --> 01:16:06,527
Your situation

1506
01:16:08,831 --> 01:16:11,903
Knowing what we know and what we've gone over about the structure

1507
01:16:12,159 --> 01:16:12,927
The Federal Reserve

1508
01:16:13,183 --> 01:16:13,951
Like it

1509
01:16:14,207 --> 01:16:14,719
Ludacris

1510
01:16:14,975 --> 01:16:15,487
To hear something

1511
01:16:17,023 --> 01:16:20,095
Thinking they are a strictly private business

1512
01:16:20,607 --> 01:16:21,375
For-profit

1513
01:16:22,143 --> 01:16:23,423
That takes all this money and

1514
01:16:27,263 --> 01:16:30,079
You would think maybe it's possible that they bought up all the

1515
01:16:30,335 --> 01:16:32,639
These companies we live in a world where everybody

1516
01:16:32,895 --> 01:16:33,919
Just run by the Federal Reserve

1517
01:16:34,431 --> 01:16:34,943
But

1518
01:16:35,199 --> 01:16:39,807
If you do those two steps that you've already talked about being so painful

1519
01:16:40,063 --> 01:16:41,599
8 boring and frustrating

1520
01:16:41,855 --> 01:16:42,367
If you make it

1521
01:16:42,623 --> 01:16:43,903
Get through those two or three steps

1522
01:16:44,415 --> 01:16:45,439
To the point where you understand

1523
01:16:45,695 --> 01:16:46,719
What the structure of this

1524
01:16:46,975 --> 01:16:48,255
Actual private-public

1525
01:16:48,511 --> 01:16:49,279
What business is

1526
01:16:49,535 --> 01:16:50,559
You would hear that sentence

1527
01:16:50,815 --> 01:16:52,607
To be like go f*** yourself

1528
01:16:53,119 --> 01:16:54,911
You think you're an expert

1529
01:16:58,751 --> 01:17:00,799
Even easier

1530
01:17:02,079 --> 01:17:04,383
Remember

1531
01:17:04,639 --> 01:17:07,455
Remember how much you said that the Federal Reserve

1532
01:17:07,967 --> 01:17:08,479
Made

1533
01:17:08,991 --> 01:17:09,503
And how much they go

1534
01:17:10,015 --> 01:17:10,527
The Federal

1535
01:17:10,783 --> 01:17:12,319
I gave 89%

1536
01:17:12,575 --> 01:17:15,391
Write 45 billion dollars

1537
01:17:16,671 --> 01:17:17,951
Is 31.7 billion

1538
01:17:18,719 --> 01:17:23,327
Alright the operator

1539
01:17:23,583 --> 01:17:24,351
You know how much

1540
01:17:24,607 --> 01:17:25,119
Much money

1541
01:17:25,375 --> 01:17:27,167
4 billion hours

1542
01:17:27,679 --> 01:17:29,215
Google makes evereve

1543
01:17:29,471 --> 01:17:30,239
45 minutes

1544
01:17:30,751 --> 01:17:31,775

1545
01:17:32,031 --> 01:17:32,543
Yeah

1546
01:17:32,799 --> 01:17:36,127
Yeah it's crazy

1547
01:17:36,383 --> 01:17:42,527
Cannot buy or sell the fortune 4000

1548
01:17:49,439 --> 01:17:50,463
All this is like

1549
01:17:50,719 --> 01:17:52,767
He's just preying on people's ignorance and like

1550
01:17:53,023 --> 01:17:54,303
Hoping they don't

1551
01:17:55,071 --> 01:17:58,911
Have any spider set

1552
01:17:59,935 --> 01:18:01,983
Wilfred Webster

Write any any kind of Institute be like

1554
01:18:05,055 --> 01:18:06,591

01:18:07,871 --> 01:18:09,151
Dumser

1556
01:18:09,407 --> 01:18:10,431
Question point of order

1557
01:18:10,687 --> 01:18:11,455
Are you stupid

1558
01:18:11,711 --> 01:18:13,247
Yes alright I will retract

1559
01:18:13,503 --> 01:18:14,527
We have more to get

1560
01:18:14,783 --> 01:18:15,807
Documentary

1561
01:18:16,319 --> 01:18:18,111
I don't care really too

1562
01:18:18,367 --> 01:18:18,879
Like

1563
01:18:21,439 --> 01:18:23,487
We've already had multiple fake quotes

1564
01:18:23,743 --> 01:18:24,511
We've had

1565
01:18:24,767 --> 01:18:26,047
Allowing

1566
01:18:26,303 --> 01:18:30,655
F****** Ron Paul brother save it three people voted on the Federal Reserve

1567
01:18:31,167 --> 01:18:31,935
Yeah but

1568
01:18:32,191 --> 01:18:36,287
We've shown it explicit very literal sent three people

1569
01:18:36,543 --> 01:18:37,823
Did vote on that act

1570
01:18:38,079 --> 01:18:41,407
There were multiple others as well

1571
01:18:41,663 --> 01:18:43,967
But it from a very

1572
01:18:44,991 --> 01:18:45,503
Yes

1573
01:18:45,759 --> 01:18:46,783
Three people did both

1574
01:18:47,039 --> 01:18:51,135
We've also seen a complete misunderstanding unawareness of

1575
01:18:51,391 --> 01:18:52,927
How the Federal Reserve work

1576
01:18:53,183 --> 01:18:53,951
Were you seeing

1577
01:18:54,463 --> 01:18:54,975
8

1578
01:18:55,231 --> 01:18:59,071
Completely childish understanding of civics and how the guy

1579
01:19:05,983 --> 01:19:07,775
Take anything serious

1580
01:19:12,639 --> 01:19:17,503
It's Thunderdome man I don't listeners of our

1581
01:19:17,759 --> 01:19:18,783
Cast we are at

1582
01:19:19,039 --> 01:19:25,183
Eight and a half hours at on the show we are at 1 hour

1583
01:19:25,439 --> 01:19:28,767
Documentary

1584
01:19:29,023 --> 01:19:30,559
Spirit

1585
01:19:31,071 --> 01:19:37,215
Vic was lovely to know you don't really give a f***

1586
01:19:41,567 --> 01:19:42,847
Private central banks in Europe

1587
01:19:43,359 --> 01:19:44,383
The United States in English

1588
01:19:44,639 --> 01:19:45,919
Do taxpayer money

1589
01:19:46,175 --> 01:19:46,687
And loaned it

1590
01:19:46,943 --> 01:19:47,967
At over 30% in

1591
01:19:48,479 --> 01:19:52,575
The third world nation

1592
01:19:54,623 --> 01:19:55,903
Not to pay back the loan

1593
01:19:56,415 --> 01:19:57,695
Their third world puppets

1594
01:19:58,207 --> 01:19:58,975
Wood sign agreements

1595
01:19:59,231 --> 01:19:59,743
Stated

1596
01:20:00,255 --> 01:20:01,535
That one the country defaulted

1597
01:20:01,791 --> 01:20:04,607
The banks would be given all the natural resources and in for

1598
01:20:04,863 --> 01:20:06,655
Structure of the One Sovereign land

1599
01:20:07,167 --> 01:20:08,447
But worst of all

1600
01:20:09,215 --> 01:20:11,519
The countries would pledge future taxes

1601
01:20:11,775 --> 01:20:12,543
Paid by the people

1602
01:20:13,055 --> 01:20:13,824
In perpetuity

1603
01:20:14,080 --> 01:20:15,616
Is profit to the private

1604
01:20:17,408 --> 01:20:20,736
That's a bad deal right I mean

1605
01:20:20,992 --> 01:20:22,272
What countries is he talking about

1606
01:20:22,528 --> 01:20:25,600
About nothing

1607
01:20:26,112 --> 01:20:27,904
They did this to third world countries

1608
01:20:30,976 --> 01:20:32,000
Kind of sounds like

1609
01:20:32,256 --> 01:20:32,768
He's just

1610
01:20:33,024 --> 01:20:35,584
Extrapolating on The Americans

1611
01:20:36,096 --> 01:20:36,864
Treatment

1612
01:20:40,448 --> 01:20:43,264
Is that what you're doing or likes trying to

1613
01:20:43,520 --> 01:20:48,896
Repurpose colonialism evil that just like blame something else

1614
01:20:49,152 --> 01:20:51,200
I don't know I don't know babe

1615
01:20:52,736 --> 01:20:53,248
I bet

1616
01:20:54,272 --> 01:20:55,552
Most history

1617
01:20:55,808 --> 01:20:56,576
Is now being

1618
01:20:56,832 --> 01:20:57,344
Used

1619
01:20:57,856 --> 01:20:59,904
To benefit me again

1620
01:21:00,416 --> 01:21:06,304
And he's putting this b******* around about like

1621
01:21:06,560 --> 01:21:08,352
These third-world countries are in

1622
01:21:08,608 --> 01:21:10,144
I have to pay taxes to

1623
01:21:11,680 --> 01:21:13,984
You know there's a bunch of countries that have central banks

1624
01:21:14,240 --> 01:21:18,848
Don't have income tax

1625
01:21:19,360 --> 01:21:23,456
That's one of them's probably memory

1626
01:21:23,968 --> 01:21:27,808
Has a central bank give me an

1627
01:21:28,064 --> 01:21:34,208
I believe is another one that has never heard go back no no income

1628
01:21:38,816 --> 01:21:39,328
Who gives a

1629
01:21:43,168 --> 01:21:45,216
By the year 2000 there were few Nations

1630
01:21:45,472 --> 01:21:46,752
People sitting around

1631
01:21:47,008 --> 01:21:47,520
Design

1632
01:21:49,312 --> 01:21:53,664
The globalist were now on

1633
01:21:54,688 --> 01:21:55,456
The destruction

1634
01:21:55,712 --> 01:21:57,248
Of the western Nations economy

1635
01:21:57,504 --> 01:21:58,528
F*** that guy

1636
01:22:02,368 --> 01:22:04,416
They first remove banking regulation

1637
01:22:04,672 --> 01:22:06,208
Alright

1638
01:22:06,720 --> 01:22:08,000
I am going to give him this

1639
01:22:08,768 --> 01:22:09,280
He

1640
01:22:09,536 --> 01:22:11,584
Put up a picture of

1641
01:22:11,840 --> 01:22:13,376
Clinton

1642
01:22:13,632 --> 01:22:14,400
But but

1643
01:22:14,656 --> 01:22:16,704
Especially nefaria

1644
01:22:16,960 --> 01:22:17,472
Wow

1645
01:22:18,496 --> 01:22:19,008
It is

1646
01:22:19,264 --> 01:22:22,336
Bill Clinton

1647
01:22:22,592 --> 01:22:26,688

I don't care if I'm on your team or not on your team

1650
01:22:31,296 --> 01:22:33,088
That picture is nefarious as father

1651
01:22:33,344 --> 01:22:36,416
That picture is like the epitome of

1652
01:22:36,672 --> 01:22:38,208
Look what we did to the minority

1653
01:22:45,632 --> 01:22:46,912
Goodbye

Glass-steagall

1656
01:22:50,752 --> 01:22:51,520
It's regulation

1657
01:22:52,544 --> 01:22:53,568
Businesses operate

1658
01:22:54,080 --> 01:22:56,640

That they got rid of glass-steagall

1664
01:23:06,624 --> 01:23:09,184
Other than the idea that it's very clear

1665
01:23:09,440 --> 01:23:09,952
Too bad thing

1666
01:23:10,720 --> 01:23:12,000
The only thing that

1667
01:23:12,256 --> 01:23:14,560
Cuz he hates regulations so f****** much

1668
01:23:14,816 --> 01:23:16,864
He's allergic

1669
01:23:17,376 --> 01:23:20,448
Makes him upset

1670
01:23:22,240 --> 01:23:27,616
I don't I don't get it you eat now complaining about glasses

01:23:57,312 --> 01:24:00,640
How can I get more eyes on my product

1681

Ragweed

1682
01:24:06,528 --> 01:24:07,040
Oh yeah

1683
01:24:11,136 --> 01:24:12,416
This allowed their front company

1684
01:24:12,672 --> 01:24:13,440
To issue

1685
01:24:13,952 --> 01:24:15,232
Unlimited credits

01:24:26,240 --> 01:24:27,520
As completely legitimate

1691
01:24:29,312 --> 01:24:31,104
Because of the Fantastic return

1692
01:24:31,616 --> 01:24:32,640
Private investor

State and local

1695
01:24:35,456 --> 01:24:36,480
Invested heavily

1696
01:24:36,736 --> 01:24:37,760
They got taken the bait

1697
01:24:38,016 --> 01:24:39,296
Hook Line & Sinker

1698
01:24:41,600 --> 01:24:42,624
Troy console

1699
01:24:42,880 --> 01:24:44,416
2007

1700
01:24:44,672 --> 01:24:45,696
The bankers themselves

1701
01:24:45,952 --> 01:24:46,976
Began to bad-mouth

1702
01:24:47,232 --> 01:24:48,256
The scams of Vegas

1703
01:24:48,512 --> 01:24:49,024
And create it

1704
01:24:51,072 --> 01:24:53,376
Watch the central Bankers cut off the tsunami

1705
01:24:53,632 --> 01:24:54,144
Fiat money

1706
01:24:54,400 --> 01:24:56,192
But they have been using the pump up the bubble

1707
01:24:56,704 --> 01:24:58,240
When Congress and the public

1708
01:24:58,752 --> 01:25:00,544
Refuse to write the finance oligarch

1709

The bankers began doing gay

In financial terrorist

1712
01:25:07,200 --> 01:25:09,760
But the world would go into another Great Depression

1713
01:25:10,016 --> 01:25:11,552
Unless their demands were met

1714
01:25:12,064 --> 01:25:13,088
Further destroying

1715
01:25:14,368 --> 01:25:15,136
The stock market

1716
01:25:15,392 --> 01:25:17,952
Biggest one-day loss in history

1717
01:25:18,464 --> 01:25:19,488
But even that

1718
01:25:19,744 --> 01:25:22,048
Wasn't enough to force Congress to capitulate

1719
01:25:22,816 --> 01:25:24,608
So

1720
01:25:24,864 --> 01:25:29,216
At that point in history 777

1721
01:25:30,240 --> 01:25:33,312
Repeat not record three times in 2018

1722
01:25:34,336 --> 01:25:35,104
The top

1723
01:25:35,360 --> 01:25:37,152
Three of all-time drops

1724
01:25:37,408 --> 01:25:38,432
I'm a single day or two

1725
01:25:38,944 --> 01:25:43,808
Are you saying

1726
01:25:47,904 --> 01:25:48,416
So hold on

1727
01:25:48,672 --> 01:25:51,488
Let me try and get it

1728
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:52,768
Right so

1729
01:25:55,840 --> 01:26:00,192
Which as we all know is a nightmare in a disaster and it should never have happened

1730
01:26:00,448 --> 01:26:02,496
Rick Fridays in 1930

1731
01:26:03,008 --> 01:26:03,520
I'm sorry

1732
01:26:04,032 --> 01:26:04,544
I'm sorry

1733
01:26:06,336 --> 01:26:07,360
Sorry actually

1734
01:26:16,832 --> 01:26:22,976
I I I like it

1735
01:26:23,232 --> 01:26:26,816
A while

1736
01:26:29,888 --> 01:26:31,424
Lot of my comedy goes that way

1737
01:26:31,680 --> 01:26:35,008
Initially Drew you're not you're not really a lapse

1738
01:26:37,824 --> 01:26:40,640
I think it's just why I quit

1739
01:26:40,896 --> 01:26:43,456
Alright

1740
01:26:45,760 --> 01:26:48,064
You got it

1741
01:26:48,320 --> 01:26:49,088
Amor

1742
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:51,648
Comic

1743
01:26:51,904 --> 01:26:52,672
You're way funnier than

1744
01:27:05,728 --> 01:27:07,520
Iwa sushi

1745
01:27:13,408 --> 01:27:14,176
1913

1746
01:27:14,432 --> 01:27:15,200
Federal Reserve

1747
01:27:15,456 --> 01:27:16,224
Hear the last name

1748
01:27:16,480 --> 01:27:16,992
Crushes

1749
01:27:17,760 --> 01:27:20,576
All of the stock market

1750
01:27:21,088 --> 01:27:23,392
Laid

1751
01:27:23,648 --> 01:27:25,696
To everybody for the hundred years since

1752
01:27:25,952 --> 01:27:29,792
105 minutes after that

1753
01:27:30,048 --> 01:27:31,328
Problems

1754
01:27:31,584 --> 01:27:34,912
1929 Great Bridge

1755
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:39,008
2 or whatever in that

1756
01:27:39,264 --> 01:27:43,360
1987

1757
01:27:43,616 --> 01:27:44,128
Maybe

1758
01:27:44,384 --> 01:27:50,528
Webster

1759
01:27:50,784 --> 01:27:51,296
7

1760
01:27:51,808 --> 01:27:52,576
But then you could also

1761
01:27:52,832 --> 01:27:54,624
Consider the.com bubble subprime

1762
01:27:54,880 --> 01:27:57,696
Mortgage crisis all kind of

1763
01:27:57,952 --> 01:27:58,720
But even if you wanted to

1764
01:27:58,976 --> 01:28:00,768
Consider those two it's a pretend you got

1765
01:28:01,024 --> 01:28:01,536
5

1766
01:28:01,792 --> 01:28:03,072
But that's last

1767
01:28:03,328 --> 01:28:04,608
And in that 20 years

1768
01:28:04,864 --> 01:28:08,704
Federal Reserve

1769
01:28:09,728 --> 01:28:12,032
And you could say that from the

1770
01:28:13,312 --> 01:28:14,080
Fadh2

1771
01:28:14,336 --> 01:28:17,408
1929 and then what was the oil in 1933

1772
01:28:18,176 --> 01:28:19,712
No emergency

1773
01:28:19,968 --> 01:28:23,808
Citibank Bill had to be passed in 1933

1774
01:28:26,624 --> 01:28:28,928
Just going to stay out of the Great Depression

1775
01:28:29,184 --> 01:28:34,304
They they have this guy who had this like

1776
01:28:34,560 --> 01:28:35,840
Whole he's like

1777
01:28:37,120 --> 01:28:38,144
Listen I'm going to make a

1778
01:28:39,168 --> 01:28:43,520
Like a fresh agreement I'm going to make it

1779
01:28:49,408 --> 01:28:50,432
Rarity

1780
01:28:50,688 --> 01:28:51,200
So then

1781
01:28:52,736 --> 01:28:56,576
Laid out this thing and you know what it's watered down by these motherfuker

1782
01:28:57,088 --> 01:28:58,368
But it still strong

1783
01:28:58,880 --> 01:29:01,184
And it keeps going and then let's say

1784
01:29:01,440 --> 01:29:02,720
In sometime.

1785
01:29:03,744 --> 01:29:04,256
Nike

1786
01:29:06,048 --> 01:29:07,840
Somebody start trying to

1787
01:29:08,096 --> 01:29:08,864
Apartments

1788
01:29:09,888 --> 01:29:12,704
Right so how many Market crashes did we have

1789
01:29:12,960 --> 01:29:15,008
In between 1933

1790
01:29:15,776 --> 01:29:16,288
1980

1791
01:29:18,592 --> 01:29:21,664
Well if you don't count the already existing

1792
01:29:21,920 --> 01:29:28,064
Depression right

1793
01:29:28,320 --> 01:29:29,088
Ruger 10

1794
01:29:29,344 --> 01:29:31,904
0 now after this like

1795
01:29:32,160 --> 01:29:36,000
Let's end this is a completely completely random numbers

1796
01:29:36,256 --> 01:29:38,560
Completely random number 1980 passed

1797
01:29:39,584 --> 01:29:41,376
Have we had

1798
01:29:41,632 --> 01:29:42,144
A few

1799
01:29:43,424 --> 01:29:45,728
Okay it's almost like they'll really easy

1800
01:29:45,984 --> 01:29:48,544
Federal Reserve

1801
01:29:49,312 --> 01:29:50,080
Like Boogie

1802
01:29:51,104 --> 01:29:52,128
No baby

1803
01:29:52,384 --> 01:29:53,152
Deregulation of

1804
01:29:54,688 --> 01:29:58,016
I mean is Teddy to point out but

1805
01:29:58,272 --> 01:30:03,136
Alex is like

1806
01:30:04,416 --> 01:30:09,280
And his reasons were too wrong and you're wrong and f*** off Alex go f***

1807
01:30:10,048 --> 01:30:11,584
Senator inhofe of Oklahoma

1808
01:30:12,096 --> 01:30:14,400
And Congressman Brad Sherman of California

1809
01:30:14,656 --> 01:30:15,424
Amongst others

1810
01:30:15,936 --> 01:30:19,520
Nobu

1811
01:30:20,032 --> 01:30:22,592
With martial law by the White House and the treasury of

1812
01:30:23,104 --> 01:30:23,872
Olay didn't pass

1813
01:30:24,128 --> 01:30:25,664
The so-called Baker bailout bill

1814
01:30:28,224 --> 01:30:32,320
The beginning of the episode about how Brad Sherman came on Alex Jones Show

1815
01:30:32,576 --> 01:30:33,344
Refuses to acknowledge

1816
01:30:33,600 --> 01:30:34,368
Which of the he explained

1817
01:30:34,624 --> 01:30:35,136
You was talking about

1818
01:30:35,392 --> 01:30:37,184
Only way they can pass this bill

1819
01:30:37,696 --> 01:30:38,720
Is by creating

1820
01:30:38,976 --> 01:30:40,256
And sustaining a panic

1821
01:30:41,536 --> 01:30:42,048
Bad acne

1822
01:30:42,304 --> 01:30:43,072
His fear is not

1823
01:30:43,328 --> 01:30:43,840
Justified

1824
01:30:44,864 --> 01:30:46,912
Many of us were told in private

1825
01:30:47,680 --> 01:30:49,472
Did it we voted against this bill

1826
01:30:50,240 --> 01:30:50,752
On Monday

1827
01:30:51,776 --> 01:30:52,288
Vet

1828
01:30:52,544 --> 01:30:53,568
The sky would fall

1829
01:30:54,080 --> 01:30:56,128
The market would drop to 3,000 points

1830
01:30:56,384 --> 01:30:58,176
The first day another couple thousand the second

1831
01:30:58,944 --> 01:31:00,736
And a few members were even told

1832
01:31:01,248 --> 01:31:03,040
That there would be martial law

1833
01:31:03,296 --> 01:31:04,832
In America if we voted no

1834
01:31:05,856 --> 01:31:07,136
That's what I call firme

1835
01:31:07,648 --> 01:31:09,952
If there's one thing I've learned from watching C-SPAN

1836
01:31:10,208 --> 01:31:12,256
You can hear a man

1837
01:31:12,768 --> 01:31:14,304
Talkin on the floor of Congress

1838
01:31:14,816 --> 01:31:15,840
And hear all those echoes

1839
01:31:16,608 --> 01:31:18,400
It's because there are so many people who are so

1840
01:31:19,168 --> 01:31:19,680
Right

1841
01:31:24,800 --> 01:31:25,568
It might be like 8

1842
01:31:25,824 --> 01:31:31,200
Situations people on the floor

1843
01:31:34,016 --> 01:31:39,904
It is like you know you want to put something in the Congressional Record

1844
01:31:40,160 --> 01:31:41,440
That's possible

1845
01:31:41,696 --> 01:31:42,464
Situation with this was

1846
01:31:42,976 --> 01:31:44,000
I hear Brad Sherman

1847
01:31:45,792 --> 01:31:46,816
More deferiet then

1848
01:31:47,584 --> 01:31:48,352
Exactly what

1849
01:31:48,608 --> 01:31:49,120
Describe

1850
01:31:50,400 --> 01:31:50,912
The show

1851
01:31:51,168 --> 01:31:52,960
I don't hear this is being like

1852
01:31:53,472 --> 01:31:57,056
Someone some strong-arm a****** commands like

1853
01:31:58,336 --> 01:31:59,104
Martial law you son-of-a

1854
01:31:59,872 --> 01:32:00,384
S'mores

1855
01:32:00,640 --> 01:32:02,176
Everyone is freaking out

1856
01:32:02,432 --> 01:32:03,968
The idea that this could lead

1857
01:32:06,528 --> 01:32:07,808
The monetary system

1858
01:32:10,112 --> 01:32:10,880
People talk s***

1859
01:32:16,512 --> 01:32:17,792
Can you imagine how bad

1860
01:32:18,304 --> 01:32:18,816
Going to get

1861
01:32:19,072 --> 01:32:23,936
This is the time when braking show and starts

1862
01:32:24,192 --> 01:32:24,704
Bright

1863
01:32:25,216 --> 01:32:25,728
No

1864
01:32:31,616 --> 01:32:32,384
Does anybody

1865
01:32:33,664 --> 01:32:34,176
The gorgeous

1866
01:32:34,432 --> 01:32:35,456
Can we just get a sponsorship

1867
01:32:35,712 --> 01:32:37,248
From the concept of gold

1868
01:32:37,504 --> 01:32:38,016
I think we

1869
01:32:38,272 --> 01:32:38,784
Probably

1870
01:32:39,040 --> 01:32:39,552
Could

1871
01:32:40,576 --> 01:32:46,720
How many based on the fact that Webster Tarpley still has a show on Genesis I bet we could too

1872
01:32:46,976 --> 01:32:48,512
Except

1873
01:32:48,768 --> 01:32:49,280
Just like

1874
01:32:49,536 --> 01:32:50,048
He's.

1875
01:32:50,304 --> 01:32:53,632
Yearly talkingshit on Alex like

1876
01:32:53,888 --> 01:32:56,192
He clearly hates libertarianism

1877
01:32:56,704 --> 01:32:59,008
And Ron Paul are there

1878
01:32:59,264 --> 01:33:01,312
Can't imagine what his standard for like

1879
01:33:02,336 --> 01:33:03,360
How do you get kicked off setting

1880
01:33:03,872 --> 01:33:05,664
All I want to do is sell diamond gusset

1881
01:33:06,176 --> 01:33:07,712
That's all I've ever wanted this way

1882
01:33:08,224 --> 01:33:11,552
I will sing I will sing that suck

1883
01:33:11,808 --> 01:33:13,344
Can song

1884
01:33:13,600 --> 01:33:14,112
Okay

1885
01:33:15,136 --> 01:33:15,648
Unjust

1886
01:33:16,928 --> 01:33:18,208
The final version of the bill was

1887
01:33:18,464 --> 01:33:21,024
Was Kept Secret from the Congress until minutes before the vote

1888
01:33:21,536 --> 01:33:23,072
On October 3rd 2008

1889
01:33:23,840 --> 01:33:25,120
This isn't true

1890
01:33:25,632 --> 01:33:27,168
The bailout bill was not

1891
01:33:27,680 --> 01:33:29,216
Litchfield Pasta House on September

1892
01:33:29,472 --> 01:33:30,752
29th 2008

1893
01:33:31,264 --> 01:33:34,080
Took up a new version of it

1894
01:33:34,848 --> 01:33:36,384
October 1st 2000

1895
01:33:36,896 --> 01:33:38,176
And then it was sent to the house

1896
01:33:38,432 --> 01:33:40,480
Voted through on October 3rd

1897
01:33:40,736 --> 01:33:41,504
It was quick

1898
01:33:42,016 --> 01:33:42,784
But it wasn't

1899
01:33:43,296 --> 01:33:45,088
Nor were they given minutes

1900
01:33:45,856 --> 01:33:46,880
This is all just b*******

1901
01:33:48,928 --> 01:33:50,464
The Federal Reserve and promise

1902
01:33:50,720 --> 01:33:51,488
Total transparency

1903
01:33:52,512 --> 01:33:54,304
Let every dime would be accounted for

1904
01:33:56,096 --> 01:33:57,376
The Democrats and Republicans

1905
01:33:57,888 --> 01:34:00,192
Bernie pissed again

1906
01:34:00,960 --> 01:34:01,472
Step Up

1907
01:34:01,984 --> 01:34:02,496
Philip White

1908
01:34:02,752 --> 01:34:03,776
Let's do what's right

1909
01:34:04,288 --> 01:34:09,152
For the country at this time

1910
01:34:10,432 --> 01:34:12,224
The second time

1911
01:34:13,504 --> 01:34:14,272
The time to act

1912
01:34:14,784 --> 01:34:15,296
Is now

1913
01:34:16,320 --> 01:34:16,832
Superbad

1914
01:34:17,088 --> 01:34:18,880
The possibility of a crisis

1915
01:34:19,392 --> 01:34:20,672
Turning into a capacitor

1916
01:34:24,256 --> 01:34:26,048
Publix

1917
01:34:31,424 --> 01:34:34,752
The building just give 700 billion dollars to the banks

1918
01:34:35,008 --> 01:34:35,520
It was a blank

1919
01:34:35,776 --> 01:34:36,288
Check

1920
01:34:36,544 --> 01:34:38,848
And as of February 2009

1921
01:34:39,360 --> 01:34:40,640
9.7 trillion

1922
01:34:41,152 --> 01:34:42,944
Has disappeared into a black hole

1923
01:34:43,200 --> 01:34:43,712
Not true

1924
01:34:43,968 --> 01:34:45,248
Not true at all

1925
01:34:46,528 --> 01:34:47,552
The place that I did

1926
01:34:48,320 --> 01:34:50,112
Here's an article that Alex puts up on

1927
01:34:50,368 --> 01:34:51,648
Screen about this 94

1928
01:34:51,904 --> 01:34:52,416
7 trillion

1929
01:34:52,672 --> 01:34:53,184
Dollars

1930
01:34:54,208 --> 01:34:56,256
It's interesting because if you go find that article

1931
01:34:56,512 --> 01:34:57,536
Will you find it that

1932
01:34:57,792 --> 01:35:02,400
In this article a clearly talks about the 9.7 trillion dollars and 7

1933
01:35:02,912 --> 01:35:03,680
700

1934
01:35:03,936 --> 01:35:05,472
100 billion dollar numbers

1935
01:35:05,728 --> 01:35:06,752
They're two different things

1936
01:35:07,264 --> 01:35:08,800
700 billion dollars is

1937
01:35:09,056 --> 01:35:09,824
Is the bailout the tarp

1938
01:35:10,080 --> 01:35:10,592
Save-A-Lot

1939
01:35:10,848 --> 01:35:12,640
Who's passing late 2008

1940
01:35:12,896 --> 01:35:16,224
The 9.7 trillion dollars is a figure that's being batted around

1941
01:35:16,480 --> 01:35:18,528
About what the Federal Reserve was going to land

1942
01:35:18,784 --> 01:35:19,296
The banks

1943
01:35:19,552 --> 01:35:20,064
They're different

1944
01:35:20,320 --> 01:35:21,344
Money

1945
01:35:21,856 --> 01:35:22,880
They're different things

1946
01:35:23,136 --> 01:35:23,648
And

1947
01:35:23,904 --> 01:35:26,208
They're not missing it's not missing

1948
01:35:26,464 --> 01:35:27,488
It's not stolen

1949
01:35:27,744 --> 01:35:28,256
It's not messing

1950
01:35:28,512 --> 01:35:31,328
Yeah if you accept

1951
01:35:31,584 --> 01:35:32,096
Inception

1952
01:35:32,352 --> 01:35:33,888
Federal Reserve

1953
01:35:34,400 --> 01:35:35,424
As some sort of a

1954
01:35:35,680 --> 01:35:36,192
Evil

1955
01:35:36,448 --> 01:35:38,240
Evil Corporation

1956
01:35:41,312 --> 01:35:43,104
Within 24 hours of its Passage

1957
01:35:43,616 --> 01:35:45,920
Secretary of Treasury Henry Paulson said

1958
01:35:46,176 --> 01:35:49,248
They were no longer going to use the money to unfreeze the mortgage Market

1959
01:35:49,504 --> 01:35:50,272
By buying bad day

1960
01:35:52,064 --> 01:35:52,576
We went

1961
01:35:53,088 --> 01:35:53,600
The Congress

1962
01:35:54,112 --> 01:35:56,416
Illiquid assets look like the way to go

1963
01:35:56,928 --> 01:35:58,464
As a situation worsened

1964
01:35:58,720 --> 01:36:01,024
The facts change I will never apologize

1965
01:36:01,280 --> 01:36:02,048
424

1966
01:36:02,304 --> 01:36:04,608
Changing an approach or strategy when the facts check

1967
01:36:05,632 --> 01:36:07,168
Honestly clip

1968
01:36:07,424 --> 01:36:08,192
Makes

1969
01:36:08,448 --> 01:36:14,592
Like a reasonable person angry at all

1970
01:36:14,848 --> 01:36:19,200
Apologize for changing my position when facts

1971
01:36:19,456 --> 01:36:19,968
Change

1972
01:36:20,224 --> 01:36:20,736
Yeah

1973
01:36:20,992 --> 01:36:25,600
You're ever going to get good thing I was wrong

1974
01:36:25,856 --> 01:36:26,368
We didn't

1975
01:36:26,624 --> 01:36:27,648
Approaching we f*****

1976
01:36:27,904 --> 01:36:30,208
Stop sorry about that

1977
01:36:30,464 --> 01:36:36,608
And then we tried this and that didn't work much as we thought it would

1978
01:36:36,864 --> 01:36:38,912
What's going on so we're going to do that

1979
01:36:40,192 --> 01:36:43,264
Was that we thought it was this

1980
01:36:45,568 --> 01:36:46,080
Whoops

1981
01:36:47,104 --> 01:36:48,640
That was Henry Paulson

1982
01:36:49,152 --> 01:36:52,736
Yeah day later

1983
01:36:52,992 --> 01:36:53,504
Henri-paul

1984
01:36:53,760 --> 01:36:55,808
Flip the script on everybody

1985
01:36:56,064 --> 01:36:57,088
And now we're not

1986
01:36:57,344 --> 01:36:58,112
When do we start

1987
01:36:58,368 --> 01:36:58,880
Going to do

1988
01:36:59,136 --> 01:37:00,416
Took him out on a stroll

1989
01:37:01,440 --> 01:37:02,464
Like nah f*** that

1990
01:37:02,976 --> 01:37:04,000
It's my way or the highway

1991
01:37:04,256 --> 01:37:05,280
24 hours later

1992
01:37:05,792 --> 01:37:06,560
He tricked everybody

1993
01:37:07,328 --> 01:37:07,840
Bulshit

1994
01:37:08,352 --> 01:37:12,960
The emergency economic stabilization Act of 2008 was passed into law in October 3rd

1995
01:37:13,216 --> 01:37:13,728
2008

1996
01:37:14,240 --> 01:37:15,776
The quote Alex Jones

1997
01:37:16,288 --> 01:37:16,800
Henry Paulson

1998
01:37:17,312 --> 01:37:19,104
It comes from an article in Bloomberg

1999
01:37:19,616 --> 01:37:21,152
That was reporting on the speech

2000
01:37:22,688 --> 01:37:23,456
He was making there

2001
01:37:23,712 --> 01:37:25,248
It was from November 12th

2002
01:37:25,504 --> 01:37:26,016
2000

2003
01:37:26,528 --> 01:37:27,552
Over a month later

2004
01:37:28,320 --> 01:37:31,904
The quote in reference to what they were going to do with the second half of the 700 building

2005
01:37:32,160 --> 01:37:32,672
Dollars

2006
01:37:32,928 --> 01:37:35,488
The initial plan of buying up all the devalued assets

2007
01:37:35,744 --> 01:37:36,256
Clearing up

2008
01:37:37,536 --> 01:37:39,072
I'm gone as well as they'd hoped

2009
01:37:39,328 --> 01:37:40,864
So the treasure is looking for a different

2010
01:37:41,120 --> 01:37:44,192
Approach instead of looking for ways to die

2011
01:37:44,448 --> 01:37:45,984
Keep going down the same road

2012
01:37:46,240 --> 01:37:48,288
They're exploring the idea of even consume

2013
01:37:48,544 --> 01:37:49,056
Credit One

2014
01:37:49,824 --> 01:37:50,592
Right or wrong

2015
01:37:51,104 --> 01:37:52,384
It's not some sort of evil Act

2016
01:37:52,640 --> 01:37:54,688
Weather

2017
01:37:55,712 --> 01:37:58,784
This was November 12th 2008

2018
01:37:59,040 --> 01:38:00,832
That's correct when Obama had been present

2019
01:38:01,088 --> 01:38:01,600
A sex years

2020
01:38:02,368 --> 01:38:03,648
I think you've been

2021
01:38:03,904 --> 01:38:04,416
Did four days

2022
01:38:11,072 --> 01:38:17,216
Going to make hay out of that door to dance all over Alex being like this

2023
01:38:17,472 --> 01:38:19,776
None of this is Obama's fault really

2024
01:38:21,568 --> 01:38:24,640
Is really is the police involved with

2025
01:38:25,920 --> 01:38:28,480
Personal level

2026
01:38:28,736 --> 01:38:29,760
The only reason I don't

2027
01:38:30,016 --> 01:38:32,320
Keep bringing that up is the Alex pretends that

2028
01:38:32,576 --> 01:38:34,880
The point of this documentary is not Obama

2029
01:38:39,488 --> 01:38:41,792
Who's the dummy

2030
01:38:46,400 --> 01:38:48,448
Isn't really a refutation of Alex

2031
01:38:48,704 --> 01:38:49,472
Still just throwback

2032
01:38:53,056 --> 01:38:54,592
I stopped myself whenever I

2033
01:38:54,848 --> 01:38:56,896
We're talkin about

2034
01:38:57,152 --> 01:38:57,664
The only time

2035
01:39:00,224 --> 01:39:06,368
Looks like Alex is using to C-SPAN appearance from Ramen 2006

2036
01:39:06,624 --> 01:39:08,672
Irrelevant

2037
01:39:09,696 --> 01:39:15,584
The way that we're doing this podcast I feel like we need at least once every hour to remind people that

2038
01:39:16,352 --> 01:39:18,144
This is not about Obama.

2039
01:39:18,656 --> 01:39:23,008
Not really can't be because he's only been in office for less than

2040
01:39:28,640 --> 01:39:30,688
Paulson has in the meantime admitted

2041
01:39:31,456 --> 01:39:32,736
The subprime mortgage crisis

2042
01:39:33,248 --> 01:39:33,760
Is map

2043
01:39:34,016 --> 01:39:34,784
The car is really

2044
01:39:36,064 --> 01:39:37,088
Entire world

2045
01:39:37,344 --> 01:39:37,856
System in the bankrupt

2046
01:39:38,112 --> 01:39:39,392
Most of the banks in London

2047
01:39:39,904 --> 01:39:40,416
Ending.

2048
01:39:40,672 --> 01:39:41,184
In Wall Street

2049
01:39:45,024 --> 01:39:45,536
Subprime

2050
01:39:45,792 --> 01:39:47,072
Mortgage is what he's talking about his

2051
01:39:47,328 --> 01:39:47,840
Derivative

2052
01:39:48,096 --> 01:39:52,448
The reason I write mrs. because of the idea that he's like why are we wet this

2053
01:39:52,704 --> 01:39:54,752
Approach and it didn't have the effect Lee wanted to

2054
01:39:55,008 --> 01:39:57,312
So we're do it we're going to use the rest of the money

2055
01:39:58,592 --> 01:39:59,104
Reproach

2056
01:40:00,128 --> 01:40:00,896
Webster Tarpley

2057
01:40:01,152 --> 01:40:02,432
Pretending that what Henry Paulson

2058
01:40:02,688 --> 01:40:03,968
We're saying was this isn't

2059
01:40:04,224 --> 01:40:04,736
The reason

2060
01:40:05,248 --> 01:40:06,784
For the things

2061
01:40:07,040 --> 01:40:08,064
The situation

2062
01:40:08,320 --> 01:40:09,344
As opposed to being like

2063
01:40:09,600 --> 01:40:12,672
This is not be the best way for us to move forward

2064
01:40:12,928 --> 01:40:15,232
It's a fine distinction but this is a lie

2065
01:40:16,768 --> 01:40:17,280
Derivative

2066
01:40:17,536 --> 01:40:18,560
Are the center of the

2067
01:40:18,816 --> 01:40:19,328
The crisis

2068
01:40:19,584 --> 01:40:20,864
Which season

2069
01:40:21,376 --> 01:40:23,680
Where the money would go in

2070
01:40:25,728 --> 01:40:29,824
I believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberties than standing arm

2071
01:40:30,848 --> 01:40:34,944
The American people ever allow private Banks to control the issuance of their currency

2072
01:40:35,456 --> 01:40:36,480
First by inflation

2073
01:40:36,992 --> 01:40:43,136
Then by deflation Banks and corporations

2074
01:40:44,416 --> 01:40:48,512
Children children wake up home

2075
01:40:49,024 --> 01:40:50,048
Issuing power

2076
01:40:50,560 --> 01:40:51,840
Should be taken from the bank

2077
01:40:52,608 --> 01:40:53,632
And restored to the people

2078
01:40:54,144 --> 01:40:55,680
Properly belongs

2079
01:40:56,192 --> 01:40:56,960
Thomas Jefferson

2080
01:40:57,728 --> 01:40:59,264
Third president of the United States

2081
01:41:03,872 --> 01:41:05,664
Daytona track record so far

2082
01:41:06,176 --> 01:41:12,320
Dan before you say another goddamn word did Thomas Jefferson actually write that f****** s***

2083
01:41:13,600 --> 01:41:19,744
But also the reason I waited till the end

2084
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:22,816
The whole thing up on

2085
01:41:23,072 --> 01:41:28,704
Sunscreen

2086
01:41:30,752 --> 01:41:33,056
Didn't happen

2087
01:41:35,872 --> 01:41:36,640
F****** fat

2088
01:41:38,432 --> 01:41:43,552
We have had like

2089
01:41:49,952 --> 01:41:56,096
I think it was like 6 fake quote in endgame and now we're like to work

2090
01:41:56,352 --> 01:41:58,656
At this point on this episodes

2091
01:41:59,424 --> 01:42:00,192
You know that's

2092
01:42:01,472 --> 01:42:02,496
Documentaries of

2093
01:42:03,264 --> 01:42:07,872
Completely out of whole cloth making a quote now with this quote it's really interesting

2094
01:42:08,128 --> 01:42:10,176
The earliest reference to this quote according to

2095
01:42:10,432 --> 01:42:11,200
The Jefferson in cycle

2096
01:42:11,456 --> 01:42:13,248
Pedia is from 1937

2097
01:42:14,528 --> 01:42:15,040
Cousin died

2098
01:42:15,552 --> 01:42:16,064
26

2099
01:42:16,576 --> 01:42:18,880
Right that's Drake number one

2100
01:42:19,136 --> 01:42:20,928
Strike number two is the use of the word

2101
01:42:21,184 --> 01:42:22,720
Deflation to describe the process that

2102
01:42:22,976 --> 01:42:23,488
The money goes

2103
01:42:24,256 --> 01:42:28,096
According to the Oxford English Dictionary that words intake on that meeting until night

2104
01:42:28,608 --> 01:42:29,120
20

2105
01:42:29,632 --> 01:42:30,144
Almost

2106
01:42:30,400 --> 01:42:31,936
100 years after he died

2107
01:42:32,192 --> 01:42:33,472
You know where you said that

2108
01:42:33,728 --> 01:42:34,496
In his defense

2109
01:42:35,008 --> 01:42:35,776
Thomas Jefferson

2110
01:42:36,032 --> 01:42:39,616
Love balloons and its many metaphorical

2111
01:42:43,712 --> 01:42:44,992
Until 1920

2112
01:42:45,248 --> 01:42:47,040
Oxford English Dictionary

2113
01:42:47,296 --> 01:42:52,160
Etymology

2114
01:42:52,672 --> 01:42:54,208
A good resource

2115
01:42:56,256 --> 01:43:00,352
Alex has up their on-screen this is a letter to Albert

2116
01:43:00,608 --> 01:43:01,888
Gallatin but according to

2117
01:43:02,912 --> 01:43:03,424
Sometimes

2118
01:43:03,936 --> 01:43:05,984
Those words don't Gallatin has been dead

2119
01:43:06,496 --> 01:43:07,776
25

2120
01:43:08,032 --> 01:43:09,824
Those words appear in any letters

2121
01:43:10,080 --> 01:43:11,872
Jefferson Road Gallatin

2122
01:43:13,408 --> 01:43:14,688
I believe the banking is

2123
01:43:14,944 --> 01:43:17,760
Students are more dangerous to our liberties than standing armies

2124
01:43:18,272 --> 01:43:19,296
Is a paraphrase

2125
01:43:19,552 --> 01:43:22,624
In a letter to John Taylor

2126
01:43:22,880 --> 01:43:23,904
14 years

2127
01:43:24,160 --> 01:43:30,304
After Alex is claiming that letter was completely made up

2128
01:43:31,840 --> 01:43:35,168
I love it

2129
01:43:35,424 --> 01:43:36,448
Yeah I know

2130
01:43:36,960 --> 01:43:40,544
It is you can trace it down cuz those people who care about this stuff a lot

2131
01:43:40,800 --> 01:43:43,872
Fun to realize that you could make a lie that everybody knows

2132
01:43:44,128 --> 01:43:45,152
Bulshit today

2133
01:43:45,408 --> 01:43:47,968
Become the Bedrock

2134
01:43:48,224 --> 01:43:49,248
Truth 100 years

2135
01:43:49,504 --> 01:43:54,112
Might create an entire dump movie

2136
01:43:54,368 --> 01:43:55,136
Record is one of the most

2137
01:43:55,392 --> 01:43:56,672
Important of Alex

2138
01:43:56,928 --> 01:44:00,512
That idea of if we let these Banks do what they want to do

2139
01:44:01,792 --> 01:44:07,424
For our children or grandchildren to be slaves in a land where we conquered it

2140
01:44:14,592 --> 01:44:15,360
Knowing

2141
01:44:15,872 --> 01:44:16,640
Just made that up

2142
01:44:17,152 --> 01:44:19,200
1930 Thomas Jefferson

2143
01:44:19,712 --> 01:44:21,504
It's very rewarding to me

2144
01:44:21,760 --> 01:44:23,040
Yeah they're like

2145
01:44:23,296 --> 01:44:23,808
Hahaha

2146
01:44:26,368 --> 01:44:29,696
What is nice about it is that because our language is so

2147
01:44:29,952 --> 01:44:31,232
Completely and utterly different

2148
01:44:31,488 --> 01:44:32,768
Now it would be hard

2149
01:44:33,024 --> 01:44:33,536
2 makeup

2150
01:44:33,792 --> 01:44:37,376
Like it would be hard to make up quotes

2151
01:44:37,632 --> 01:44:40,704
162

2152
01:44:40,960 --> 01:44:42,752
Emoji Emoji Emoji

2153
01:44:43,264 --> 01:44:44,544
Believing the truth emoji

2154
01:44:44,800 --> 01:44:47,872
Easier to track

2155
01:44:48,128 --> 01:44:49,664
Imagine that wouldn't

2156
01:44:50,176 --> 01:44:50,944
Congressional Record

2157
01:44:51,200 --> 01:44:51,968
See you in 10 years

2158
01:44:54,784 --> 01:44:55,552
The Congressional Record

2159
01:44:55,808 --> 01:44:58,112
Is going to look like

2160
01:44:58,368 --> 01:44:58,880
Your friend of fraud

2161
01:44:59,392 --> 01:45:02,720
Like the idea that deflation didn't have that

2162
01:45:02,976 --> 01:45:04,256
Back then is a

2163
01:45:04,512 --> 01:45:05,536
Marker the people

2164
01:45:05,792 --> 01:45:06,304
Can use

2165
01:45:06,560 --> 01:45:07,840
To go back and be like

2166
01:45:08,352 --> 01:45:10,400
There's no way he said this amazing

2167
01:45:10,656 --> 01:45:11,424
That's not

2168
01:45:11,680 --> 01:45:12,704
Someone else wrote

2169
01:45:12,960 --> 01:45:17,568
It's like when you go back through the Bible and you start looking at the derivation of all the words you like

2170
01:45:18,080 --> 01:45:18,848
This was not rich

2171
01:45:19,360 --> 01:45:21,408
Whenever its purported to have been written

2172
01:45:21,920 --> 01:45:26,528
This is clearly showing the signs of this time. And so on

2173
01:45:27,296 --> 01:45:27,808
Fixer

2174
01:45:28,320 --> 01:45:29,600
The Great

2175
01:45:29,856 --> 01:45:30,880
I like

2176
01:45:31,136 --> 01:45:34,464
Sprite has a really fun

2177
01:45:34,720 --> 01:45:38,048
He has a degree in

2178
01:45:39,072 --> 01:45:43,168
Secretary Paulson came in with the vice president

2179
01:45:43,424 --> 01:45:49,312
You idiot

2180
01:45:49,568 --> 01:45:50,080
Need

2181
01:45:50,592 --> 01:45:52,128
To get rid of the Coronavirus

2182
01:45:53,664 --> 01:45:54,176
Derivative

2183
01:45:54,432 --> 01:45:55,456
Products

2184
01:45:55,712 --> 01:45:56,224
Different names

2185
01:45:56,736 --> 01:45:57,248
For this

2186
01:45:59,040 --> 01:45:59,552
You know

2187
01:46:01,088 --> 01:46:02,368
If we traded

2188
01:46:02,624 --> 01:46:04,928
Credit-default swap

2189
01:46:05,440 --> 01:46:06,208
Okay but they

2190
01:46:06,464 --> 01:46:08,512
They talked about them as though they knew what

2191
01:46:09,024 --> 01:46:09,792
Hell they were

2192
01:46:10,816 --> 01:46:11,584
You got the money

2193
01:46:11,840 --> 01:46:12,608
And you remediate

2194
01:46:12,864 --> 01:46:13,632
Italy

2195
01:46:14,400 --> 01:46:14,912
What

2196
01:46:15,936 --> 01:46:16,960
Items what are

2197
01:46:17,728 --> 01:46:19,008
Now the treasury just just

2198
01:46:19,264 --> 01:46:25,408
Basically cut that out of the bill

2199
01:46:26,688 --> 01:46:27,456
A banks

2200
01:46:27,712 --> 01:46:29,248
Hoarding the money

2201
01:46:30,272 --> 01:46:33,344
That they're getting from the tarp they're using the money to purchase other bags

2202
01:46:34,112 --> 01:46:38,208
And I remember

2203
01:46:38,720 --> 01:46:41,280
We're going to give you the money that you want you do what you want with it

2204
01:46:41,536 --> 01:46:42,560
Unless you directed

2205
01:46:43,840 --> 01:46:45,376
Pacifically it's not going to happen

2206
01:46:45,632 --> 01:46:46,400
I don't think anyone

2207
01:46:47,680 --> 01:46:48,192
Questions

2208
01:46:49,216 --> 01:46:49,728
Kashkari

2209
01:46:51,264 --> 01:46:52,288
That you're working hard

2210
01:46:53,824 --> 01:46:54,336
Carquest

2211
01:46:56,640 --> 01:46:57,152
Before

2212
01:47:00,992 --> 01:47:01,760
Yeah

2213
01:47:02,528 --> 01:47:04,576
Kashkari was worth it was it that's

2214
01:47:04,832 --> 01:47:06,112
That's Bush Administration

2215
01:47:11,744 --> 01:47:13,280
Implying there's very clearly

2216
01:47:13,536 --> 01:47:16,608
The best interests of the people or for

2217
01:47:19,680 --> 01:47:21,984
Just trying to play this up as some sort of like a

2218
01:47:22,240 --> 01:47:27,872
Are you working for the Illuminati

2219
01:47:28,128 --> 01:47:31,200
System of revolving door

2220
01:47:31,456 --> 01:47:33,760
Regulatory capture as they would be

2221
01:47:34,016 --> 01:47:35,040
Also

2222
01:47:35,296 --> 01:47:36,064
One thing

2223
01:47:36,576 --> 01:47:37,600
And I need to talk about

2224
01:47:41,440 --> 01:47:42,208
It's so good

2225
01:47:43,744 --> 01:47:44,512
This is the only thing

2226
01:47:44,768 --> 01:47:46,816
That I've ever been able to think about kucinich

2227
01:47:47,072 --> 01:47:47,584
And I

2228
01:47:47,840 --> 01:47:48,608
Read a lot about his

2229
01:47:48,864 --> 01:47:49,376
Policies

2230
01:47:49,888 --> 01:47:51,680
I've read a lot about hitting today

2231
01:47:51,936 --> 01:47:57,312
Nothing more than what you're about to say

2232
01:47:57,568 --> 01:47:59,616
This is the one thing I said I thought

2233
01:48:01,152 --> 01:48:03,968
Has any Taylor ever been able to figure him out

2234
01:48:04,480 --> 01:48:05,760
Every night

2235
01:48:06,016 --> 01:48:10,624
There are zero since I have ever seen him in that make even the slightest

2236
01:48:11,392 --> 01:48:12,416
Throughout its past

2237
01:48:12,672 --> 01:48:14,464
President Bush and Senator Obama

2238
01:48:14,976 --> 01:48:17,536
Worked in tandem to get Congress to pass the bill

2239
01:48:17,792 --> 01:48:19,584
Without even having time to read it

2240
01:48:20,096 --> 01:48:21,120
Despite the fact

2241
01:48:21,632 --> 01:48:22,656
But in major polls

2242
01:48:23,424 --> 01:48:24,448
98%

2243
01:48:24,704 --> 01:48:25,472
Of the American people

2244
01:48:25,984 --> 01:48:26,752
We're against the bill

2245
01:48:27,520 --> 01:48:29,312
The leadership in both parties were for

2246
01:48:32,128 --> 01:48:33,408
They had time to read the bill

2247
01:48:33,664 --> 01:48:35,712
But also he keeps saying both

2248
01:48:35,968 --> 01:48:38,272
Parties and what we see on screen is again

2249
01:48:38,528 --> 01:48:40,064
He's playing the exact same

2250
01:48:40,320 --> 01:48:40,832
Footage

2251
01:48:41,088 --> 01:48:41,600
Pelosi

2252
01:48:41,856 --> 01:48:43,392
Raw

2253
01:48:44,160 --> 01:48:45,440
Yeah

2254
01:48:45,696 --> 01:48:46,720
That's not 98

2255
01:48:46,976 --> 01:48:47,488
Percent is

2256
01:48:47,744 --> 01:48:49,024
Crazy literally

2257
01:48:49,536 --> 01:48:50,816
In America

2258
01:48:51,072 --> 01:48:51,584
History

2259
01:48:52,352 --> 01:48:53,888
98% of America

2260
01:48:54,144 --> 01:48:55,936
Has never agreed on something.

2261
01:48:56,704 --> 01:48:57,728
I can't find

2262
01:48:57,984 --> 01:48:59,520
Amy pool

2263
01:49:00,032 --> 01:49:03,872
Water's good like 98% of America does not agree on

2264
01:49:07,200 --> 01:49:13,344
There's no way 98% of Americans agreed on anything

2265
01:49:14,112 --> 01:49:17,696
Way too much time trying to find this pulse

2266
01:49:18,464 --> 01:49:20,768
I dug through all sorts of Records

2267
01:49:21,024 --> 01:49:23,584
Trying to figure out like he's varipole the

2268
01:49:23,840 --> 01:49:24,864
Earlier

2269
01:49:25,120 --> 01:49:27,936
I found that bull that Alex was lying about the 9%

2270
01:49:28,192 --> 01:49:34,336
Approval rating for Congress was based on

2271
01:49:34,592 --> 01:49:38,944
There was no poll that said that when there's just a slight misunderstanding

2272
01:49:39,200 --> 01:49:40,480
I can't find any

2273
01:49:40,992 --> 01:49:44,320
I'll tell you this on September 22nd 2008 Rasmussen

2274
01:49:44,576 --> 01:49:45,600
Posted

2275
01:49:45,856 --> 01:49:47,392
It showed a 28

2276
01:49:48,672 --> 01:49:49,184
Sing for the bailout

2277
01:49:49,440 --> 01:49:51,488
That's a Baseline

2278
01:49:51,744 --> 01:49:53,024
Around 1

2279
01:49:55,328 --> 01:49:56,608
On September 26th

2280
01:49:56,864 --> 01:50:00,192
2018 USA Today poll found that 70%

2281
01:50:00,448 --> 01:50:03,008
Approve Congress doing

2282
01:50:03,520 --> 01:50:06,336
But 56% thought that plan should be

2283
01:50:06,592 --> 01:50:08,128
Then what Bush suggested

2284
01:50:08,384 --> 01:50:12,224
America in a nutshell that's the most America you got

2285
01:50:14,272 --> 01:50:20,416
3 something over half days

2286
01:50:20,672 --> 01:50:23,744
Fine I don't know

2287
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:26,048
That should be written

2288
01:50:26,560 --> 01:50:30,912
Pool if you make a decision

2289
01:50:40,128 --> 01:50:43,200
Display respect hours and hours

2290
01:50:43,456 --> 01:50:49,600
Negotiating Ono American

2291
01:50:49,856 --> 01:50:50,368
Forever red

2292
01:50:51,392 --> 01:50:55,232
But I also understand

2293
01:50:55,488 --> 01:50:58,816
How many USA Today doesn't really have the best like polling

2294
01:50:59,072 --> 01:51:00,864
History like in terms of their like

2295
01:51:02,656 --> 01:51:04,704
Statistics of credibility

2296
01:51:06,240 --> 01:51:07,264
I smell that pulled

2297
01:51:07,520 --> 01:51:08,288
Those numbers look like

2298
01:51:08,544 --> 01:51:14,688
You bet that seems like

2299
01:51:14,944 --> 01:51:19,808
Fivethirtyeight accuracy Remember the Time. 2 and it feels like

2300
01:51:20,320 --> 01:51:26,464
Feels like emotionally I might have been there

2301
01:51:26,976 --> 01:51:28,512
Yeah we got to do something

2302
01:51:28,768 --> 01:51:34,912
Whatever it is you said he might have accurately pinpoint in my emotional state

2303
01:51:35,168 --> 01:51:36,448
Articulate

2304
01:51:36,960 --> 01:51:39,264
USA Today

2305
01:51:39,520 --> 01:51:44,896
October 1st 2008. Search center released a poll showing

2306
01:51:45,152 --> 01:51:46,688
45%

2307
01:51:46,944 --> 01:51:48,224
The government's plan was the right to

2308
01:51:48,480 --> 01:51:48,992
Things to do

2309
01:51:49,248 --> 01:51:50,528
So that's pretty close to a

2310
01:51:50,784 --> 01:51:51,552
45 +

2311
01:51:52,832 --> 01:51:54,624
And ABC

2312
01:51:54,880 --> 01:51:55,648
Post survey

2313
01:51:55,904 --> 01:51:56,928
Not Apple survey

2314
01:51:57,184 --> 01:51:59,744
From September 29th found 45%

2315
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:00,512
Approval rating

2316
01:52:00,768 --> 01:52:01,280
For the proposed

2317
01:52:01,536 --> 01:52:02,048
Spelt

2318
01:52:02,304 --> 01:52:04,608
I can't find anything that even comes

2319
01:52:04,864 --> 01:52:06,656
Close to approximating a 2%

2320
01:52:06,912 --> 01:52:07,680
Santa purple radio

2321
01:52:07,936 --> 01:52:10,752
I know that as things went on things got left

2322
01:52:11,264 --> 01:52:12,800
I understand

2323
01:52:13,824 --> 01:52:15,872
I still can't find anything from around that

2324
01:52:16,384 --> 01:52:17,152
Time that is even

2325
01:52:17,408 --> 01:52:18,432
Close

2326
01:52:18,688 --> 01:52:19,712
Wilson pool

2327
01:52:20,224 --> 01:52:21,504
From September 22nd

2328
01:52:21,760 --> 01:52:22,528
The 28%

2329
01:52:23,040 --> 01:52:24,320
Is the closest I can find

2330
01:52:24,576 --> 01:52:25,088
I don't know

2331
01:52:26,112 --> 01:52:26,880
Just making this up

2332
01:52:27,136 --> 01:52:28,928
I I I really think you might

2333
01:52:29,184 --> 01:52:29,696
Just be

2334
01:52:29,952 --> 01:52:31,232
Out of nothing

2335
01:52:31,744 --> 01:52:34,816
In the in the same way that a dictator

2336
01:52:35,072 --> 01:52:37,632
Re-election by 98% of the vote

2337
01:52:37,888 --> 01:52:38,912
Is specials

2338
01:52:39,168 --> 01:52:39,936
Yeah this

2339
01:52:40,192 --> 01:52:40,704
This is

2340
01:52:40,960 --> 01:52:44,288
If it was a real polite I wouldn't believe it

2341
01:52:48,384 --> 01:52:51,712
And I really want to come in and Barack Obama because it's we were involved in the

2342
01:52:52,224 --> 01:52:54,528
This and that and different provisions of the bill to pay

2343
01:52:54,784 --> 01:52:55,552
Persuade people

2344
01:52:55,808 --> 01:52:57,600
He really gave them confidence

2345
01:52:58,112 --> 01:53:00,160
That this was the right decision

2346
01:53:00,416 --> 01:53:01,440
All for the America

2347
01:53:01,696 --> 01:53:02,208
Can people

2348
01:53:02,464 --> 01:53:03,488
Even though it wasn't

2349
01:53:04,256 --> 01:53:06,048
In our view a great bill

2350
01:53:06,816 --> 01:53:09,632
This is Nancy Pelosi

2351
01:53:09,888 --> 01:53:13,984
Alex is trying to present this as like her saying this bill sucks

2352
01:53:14,240 --> 01:53:16,288
Yeah it's like she's really expressing

2353
01:53:16,544 --> 01:53:18,080
When is the idea that

2354
01:53:18,592 --> 01:53:20,640
We would have wanted something a little bit better

2355
01:53:20,896 --> 01:53:24,480
That that's something our Democratic caucus would have

2356
01:53:24,992 --> 01:53:27,808
I'd like to thank Barack Obama for

2357
01:53:29,088 --> 01:53:30,368
Negotiator in summer

2358
01:53:31,392 --> 01:53:36,000
God brought us all together

2359
01:53:36,256 --> 01:53:37,024
Probably the right thing

2360
01:53:37,280 --> 01:53:37,792
Things to do

2361
01:53:38,048 --> 01:53:39,072
There's nothing nefarious here

2362
01:53:39,328 --> 01:53:42,656
For them to vote on the moment

2363
01:53:42,912 --> 01:53:44,704
To also think they need to do here

2364
01:53:45,216 --> 01:53:48,800
And that is bro

2365
01:53:49,312 --> 01:53:50,080
But the members of our caucus

2366
01:53:52,128 --> 01:53:52,640
Excite

2367
01:53:52,896 --> 01:53:53,920
The passes legislation

2368
01:53:57,504 --> 01:53:58,784
But they were hoarding the bailout

2369
01:53:59,040 --> 01:54:02,624
Money and using it to buy up smaller healthy Banks and insurance companies

2370
01:54:02,880 --> 01:54:05,440
They're so real quick

2371
01:54:05,952 --> 01:54:06,720
This is something

2372
01:54:07,744 --> 01:54:08,256
F****** evil

2373
01:54:08,768 --> 01:54:10,560
Because the idea that these Banks already

2374
01:54:10,816 --> 01:54:12,608
Tons of money from the government

2375
01:54:13,120 --> 01:54:13,632
They're using it

2376
01:54:13,888 --> 01:54:14,656
To buy a buzzard

2377
01:54:14,912 --> 01:54:16,960
Alex is suggesting this is super

2378
01:54:19,776 --> 01:54:20,800
But this isn't what I want

2379
01:54:21,056 --> 01:54:21,568
Presenting it

2380
01:54:21,824 --> 01:54:22,336
Tubi

2381
01:54:22,592 --> 01:54:25,408
If you go to the article that he just flashed up on screen there

2382
01:54:25,920 --> 01:54:27,968
Explain exactly what the situation is

2383
01:54:28,736 --> 01:54:30,272
Right after the part where Alex

2384
01:54:30,528 --> 01:54:33,344
The article probably strategically

2385
01:54:33,600 --> 01:54:35,648
The article goes on to say quote

2386
01:54:36,160 --> 01:54:37,696
There's a growing consensus among

2387
01:54:37,952 --> 01:54:41,792
Among Treasury and other Federal officials that allowing healthy Banks

2388
01:54:42,048 --> 01:54:44,096
To use the money to acquire Bank in

2389
01:54:44,352 --> 01:54:44,864
Jeopardy

2390
01:54:45,120 --> 01:54:45,632
Availing

2391
01:54:45,888 --> 01:54:47,168
Could stabilize the economy

2392
01:54:47,680 --> 01:54:48,448
And bolster confidence

2393
01:54:49,472 --> 01:54:52,800
This could also save money for the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation

2394
01:54:54,080 --> 01:54:57,920
Naturally this isn't ideal that he wouldn't want to be creating even bigger ant

2395
01:54:58,176 --> 01:55:02,016
These were as a whole excuse or balances

2396
01:55:02,272 --> 01:55:05,600
Beware the strategy might be considered

2397
01:55:05,856 --> 01:55:06,880
Think about it like okay

2398
01:55:08,160 --> 01:55:09,440
You got this back

2399
01:55:09,696 --> 01:55:10,208
Bright

2400
01:55:10,720 --> 01:55:11,744
We need to help them

2401
01:55:13,792 --> 01:55:16,608
Wreck that other smaller bank is also failing

2402
01:55:16,864 --> 01:55:18,400
We got to give that money to

2403
01:55:18,912 --> 01:55:23,264
Is that bigger back with the money that we gave them buys that smaller Bank

2404
01:55:23,776 --> 01:55:26,336
We no longer have to get out to get us by banking

2405
01:55:26,592 --> 01:55:30,176
Yeah there is a scent to it that makes sense

2406
01:55:30,432 --> 01:55:31,712
It's not a good strategy

2407
01:55:31,968 --> 01:55:38,112
It's not good for those situations where when you when you are in Congress there's a party that's like

2408
01:55:38,368 --> 01:55:41,184
I just want one guy

2409
01:55:41,440 --> 01:55:42,464
Kind of like

2410
01:55:43,488 --> 01:55:46,304
From their whole structure who's going to go like

2411
01:55:46,816 --> 01:55:48,096
Oh that's a dumb idea

2412
01:55:51,424 --> 01:55:55,264
That's the idea that got us to where you had right now

2413
01:55:55,776 --> 01:55:56,544
Is necessary

2414
01:55:57,056 --> 01:56:01,152
It would be me in Congress in flip

2415
01:56:01,408 --> 01:56:02,688
Swapped smoking split

2416
01:56:02,944 --> 01:56:05,760
It's like just split

2417
01:56:06,016 --> 01:56:07,552
In the house like

2418
01:56:08,576 --> 01:56:10,368
I wouldn't do that

2419
01:56:12,416 --> 01:56:15,488
5 years

2420
01:56:15,744 --> 01:56:17,280
Then

2421
01:56:17,536 --> 01:56:18,048
No

2422
01:56:18,304 --> 01:56:19,328
It's a bad

2423
01:56:19,584 --> 01:56:21,632
No

2424
01:56:21,888 --> 01:56:22,656
Absolutely

2425
01:56:22,912 --> 01:56:23,424
But if it

2426
01:56:23,936 --> 01:56:25,472
Time when we're talking about

2427
01:56:25,728 --> 01:56:26,240
An emergency

2428
01:56:27,008 --> 01:56:28,032
It does make sense

2429
01:56:28,288 --> 01:56:29,056
As

2430
01:56:29,568 --> 01:56:30,080
Business complex

2431
01:56:30,336 --> 01:56:30,848
Could help

2432
01:56:31,616 --> 01:56:32,384
Trouble

2433
01:56:32,896 --> 01:56:34,688
Could be efficient

2434
01:56:37,760 --> 01:56:39,552
You observe a lot of the damage

2435
01:56:41,344 --> 01:56:43,136
Did but but again

2436
01:56:43,392 --> 01:56:44,928
More importantly

2437
01:56:45,184 --> 01:56:46,208
Strategies f****** stupid

2438
01:56:46,464 --> 01:56:46,976
Yeah that's it

2439
01:56:47,232 --> 01:56:49,792
That's okay but see again that's not like a specific

2440
01:56:50,048 --> 01:56:54,400
Failure to failure of like

2441
01:56:55,168 --> 01:56:56,960
Well you're in Congress for a short

2442
01:56:58,752 --> 01:57:00,032
So this makes

2443
01:57:03,360 --> 01:57:03,872
Idea

2444
01:57:04,128 --> 01:57:06,688
It would still suck for a while and you might get

2445
01:57:09,504 --> 01:57:10,016
You know you might

2446
01:57:10,272 --> 01:57:11,808
Losing your next election

2447
01:57:12,320 --> 01:57:13,088
If you did the right

2448
01:57:25,888 --> 01:57:26,400
And complicated

2449
01:57:26,912 --> 01:57:29,472
But is there is it is judicious

2450
01:57:29,984 --> 01:57:30,496
Is it wise

2451
01:57:31,008 --> 01:57:32,544
Is it a smart thing to do

2452
01:57:32,800 --> 01:57:34,080
It was sort of descriptions life

2453
01:57:34,336 --> 01:57:36,384
Are applicable but like I don't know

2454
01:57:36,640 --> 01:57:37,408
Right or wrong

2455
01:57:37,920 --> 01:57:41,504
Right or wrong aspect

2456
01:57:41,760 --> 01:57:43,296
It is hard it's hard to say

2457
01:57:44,064 --> 01:57:46,112
I don't know I'm glad to make these decisions

2458
01:57:46,368 --> 01:57:48,416
But I can look at it from afar and

2459
01:57:48,672 --> 01:57:51,744
I don't need the hindsight of 20

2460
01:57:52,000 --> 01:57:53,024
18 to know

2461
01:57:53,280 --> 01:57:54,304
What was actually going

2462
01:57:54,816 --> 01:57:57,376
Haha

2463
01:57:57,632 --> 01:58:01,216
All these Banks got all this money in there like haha now we're going to buy up all these other back

2464
01:58:01,984 --> 01:58:04,800
What sort of an arrangement that was going on about the ideas

2465
01:58:05,312 --> 01:58:06,592
We can absorb

2466
01:58:06,848 --> 01:58:09,152
The damage they could come to the

2467
01:58:09,408 --> 01:58:10,176
The FDIC

2468
01:58:10,432 --> 01:58:11,456
I help out

2469
01:58:11,712 --> 01:58:13,248
And also there was a little bit of that

2470
01:58:13,760 --> 01:58:15,040
Working bikes

2471
01:58:15,552 --> 01:58:17,856
I'm sure there's

2472
01:58:19,136 --> 01:58:20,672
When was working like a charm

2473
01:58:23,232 --> 01:58:23,744
Next

2474
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:26,304
The central Bankers loan the federal government back

2475
01:58:26,816 --> 01:58:29,888
787 billion dollars of our own money

2476
01:58:30,144 --> 01:58:34,240
But I didn't really spell

2477
01:58:34,496 --> 01:58:35,776
Sophie

2478
01:58:38,080 --> 01:58:40,896
That package stabilized Bieber

2479
01:58:41,408 --> 01:58:47,552
Congress was given less than 70 Page Plus

2480
01:58:48,832 --> 01:58:49,600
Barack Obama

2481
01:58:49,856 --> 01:58:50,624
Who had pledged

2482
01:58:50,880 --> 01:58:51,648
Campaign Trail

2483
01:58:51,904 --> 01:58:54,464
Toy 5 days before a bill can be voted on

2484
01:58:54,720 --> 01:58:56,512
So that the Congress and the people

2485
01:58:56,768 --> 01:58:57,792
Could have a chance to read it

2486
01:58:58,048 --> 01:58:59,840
Studded the stimulus was too important

2487
01:59:00,096 --> 01:59:01,120
Had to be passed

2488
01:59:01,376 --> 01:59:01,888
Before anybody

2489
01:59:02,400 --> 01:59:03,680
Could see it or read it

2490
01:59:03,936 --> 01:59:04,704
Or the crisis

2491
01:59:05,216 --> 01:59:06,240
Would turn into like a task

2492
01:59:06,752 --> 01:59:11,104
Doing a little or nothing at all will result in even even greater deficits

2493
01:59:12,384 --> 01:59:13,664
Even greater job loss

2494
01:59:14,944 --> 01:59:16,224
Even greater loss of income

2495
01:59:17,504 --> 01:59:18,016
Even greater

2496
01:59:18,272 --> 01:59:18,784
Los Ocampo

2497
01:59:19,296 --> 01:59:19,808
Correct

2498
01:59:20,064 --> 01:59:20,576
On all fronts

2499
01:59:20,832 --> 01:59:22,624
Turn a crisis into a

2500
01:59:22,880 --> 01:59:24,928
Catastrophe

2501
01:59:25,184 --> 01:59:25,696
Hagrid

2502
01:59:25,952 --> 01:59:27,232
Friday passing

2503
01:59:27,744 --> 01:59:29,024
Gangster fashion

2504
01:59:29,280 --> 01:59:34,400
President Ford

2505
01:59:36,704 --> 01:59:42,848
Earlier to Alex for his restraint dog whistle

2506
01:59:43,104 --> 01:59:45,920
Earlier you said that they were just giving in

2507
01:59:46,176 --> 01:59:46,688
And they were given it

2508
01:59:46,944 --> 01:59:48,480
Hour to Reidsville that's not

2509
01:59:49,504 --> 01:59:51,552
I was introduced on January 26th

2510
01:59:51,808 --> 01:59:53,088
2019 Pasta House on

2511
01:59:53,344 --> 01:59:54,368
On January 28th

2512
01:59:54,624 --> 01:59:55,136
2009

2513
01:59:55,648 --> 01:59:57,440
It was voted on the Senate on February

2514
01:59:57,696 --> 01:59:58,464
10th 2000

2515
01:59:59,232 --> 02:00:01,024
How's time frame isn't ideal

2516
02:00:01,280 --> 02:00:02,048
I would I would

2517
02:00:02,304 --> 02:00:04,864
Refer more than a day and a half probably

2518
02:00:05,120 --> 02:00:06,656
But an hour

2519
02:00:06,912 --> 02:00:09,472
Gangster fashion bulshit

2520
02:00:13,568 --> 02:00:14,080
Alex

2521
02:00:14,336 --> 02:00:15,360
He said

2522
02:00:15,872 --> 02:00:16,640
That it is

2523
02:00:16,896 --> 02:00:19,200
Passed on Friday

2524
02:00:19,456 --> 02:00:21,760
Vacation

2525
02:00:22,528 --> 02:00:23,040
So here's the

2526
02:00:23,808 --> 02:00:24,576
I hate prison

2527
02:00:24,832 --> 02:00:25,600
To go on vacation

2528
02:00:25,856 --> 02:00:28,160
Regularly

2529
02:00:28,416 --> 02:00:29,184
40%

2530
02:00:29,440 --> 02:00:29,952
If not

2531
02:00:30,464 --> 02:00:30,976
60%

2532
02:00:31,232 --> 02:00:31,744
Of the days of the year

2533
02:00:32,768 --> 02:00:34,304
The do the stimulus bill passed

2534
02:00:34,560 --> 02:00:35,328
The house on January

2535
02:00:35,840 --> 02:00:36,864
28 2000

2536
02:00:37,376 --> 02:00:37,888
Which was when

2537
02:00:41,984 --> 02:00:42,496
Which is a tooth

2538
02:00:43,520 --> 02:00:45,824
Congress passed

2539
02:00:46,080 --> 02:00:46,848
Versions of the Bell

2540
02:00:47,360 --> 02:00:50,176
So in order to get it through they had to go to conference

2541
02:00:50,432 --> 02:00:51,456
Negotiate the Bell

2542
02:00:51,712 --> 02:00:54,784
They reached Goshi ation on February 13th 2000

2543
02:00:55,552 --> 02:00:56,576
Which is a Friday

2544
02:00:57,344 --> 02:00:58,368
Probably without to talk

2545
02:00:59,136 --> 02:01:00,928
They got through conference on

2546
02:01:01,184 --> 02:01:01,696
Next Friday

2547
02:01:02,720 --> 02:01:04,000
It was signed by Obama

2548
02:01:04,256 --> 02:01:05,024
February

2549
02:01:05,280 --> 02:01:05,792
17

2550
02:01:06,304 --> 02:01:07,072
The following Tuesday

2551
02:01:07,840 --> 02:01:10,144
That's probably because the Senate didn't take their vote

2552
02:01:10,400 --> 02:01:11,168
Until

2553
02:01:11,424 --> 02:01:12,704
The conference bill passed

2554
02:01:13,216 --> 02:01:16,288
Ellen up at like 5:30 p.m. on a Friday

2555
02:01:16,800 --> 02:01:18,080
Got to be out of there by 5

2556
02:01:21,920 --> 02:01:23,456
It's a Friday

2557
02:01:23,712 --> 02:01:24,736
Coworkers

2558
02:01:24,992 --> 02:01:26,016
Didn't die

2559
02:01:26,272 --> 02:01:28,576
So we couldn't all have a 40 hour work

2560
02:01:28,832 --> 02:01:30,880
Strongly

2561
02:01:31,136 --> 02:01:34,720
Residents can also check the f*** out

2562
02:01:37,280 --> 02:01:43,424
Going around a little bit about the bag zpacks bill at 5:30 on a Friday

2563
02:01:44,448 --> 02:01:45,472
They didn't sign it

2564
02:01:45,728 --> 02:01:46,496
Until Tuesday

2565
02:01:46,752 --> 02:01:48,032
Is because the

2566
02:01:48,800 --> 02:01:49,568
The 14

2567
02:01:50,080 --> 02:01:50,592
The day after

2568
02:01:51,104 --> 02:01:51,616
Is Valentine

2569
02:01:52,640 --> 02:01:53,152
And

2570
02:01:53,408 --> 02:01:53,920
Monday

2571
02:01:54,176 --> 02:01:54,944
February 16th

2572
02:01:55,200 --> 02:01:55,968
Was president

2573
02:01:56,992 --> 02:01:57,760
The federal holiday

2574
02:01:58,528 --> 02:02:00,320
Let the clerks have the day off

2575
02:02:00,576 --> 02:02:01,088
You can't

2576
02:02:02,368 --> 02:02:04,416
What what you think the president's going to take a

2577
02:02:04,672 --> 02:02:05,696
The federal holiday off

2578
02:02:06,720 --> 02:02:07,232
It is

2579
02:02:07,744 --> 02:02:13,888
It's literally his Dead Presidents

2580
02:02:14,144 --> 02:02:16,448
He took a vacation over the long weekend

2581
02:02:16,704 --> 02:02:18,240
They passed the bill

2582
02:02:18,496 --> 02:02:19,776
And then when he came back

2583
02:02:20,032 --> 02:02:21,312
On Tuesday

2584
02:02:21,568 --> 02:02:22,080
Yeah

2585
02:02:22,336 --> 02:02:26,688
Alex is talking about like you made it seem like such an emergency and then he

2586
02:02:26,944 --> 02:02:28,224
Was gone for the weekend

2587
02:02:28,736 --> 02:02:30,784
Will you look at this the reason it was an emergency

2588
02:02:31,040 --> 02:02:34,880
He wasn't a matter of a day or two it was a matter of dragging your

2589
02:02:35,648 --> 02:02:36,672
And that very queer

2590
02:02:36,928 --> 02:02:40,256
From there he was actually saying in the Red Orchid

2591
02:02:40,512 --> 02:02:41,280
We can't afford

2592
02:02:41,536 --> 02:02:42,304
To wait around

2593
02:02:42,560 --> 02:02:44,096
Bureaucracy getting away

2594
02:02:44,352 --> 02:02:45,120
Because

2595
02:02:45,376 --> 02:02:47,168
Do you have a situation where Congress

2596
02:02:47,424 --> 02:02:47,936
Could

2597
02:02:48,448 --> 02:02:49,216
Really

2598
02:02:49,472 --> 02:02:51,264
Gum up the works and they could get to

2599
02:02:51,520 --> 02:02:52,032
The infighting

2600
02:02:53,056 --> 02:02:55,104
Could be a whole bunch of nonsense you could end up with

2601
02:02:55,360 --> 02:02:56,896
A bill getting stuck

2602
02:02:57,408 --> 02:02:57,920
4

2603
02:02:58,432 --> 02:02:59,456
A month-to-month

2604
02:02:59,712 --> 02:03:01,760
And if you waited that long

2605
02:03:02,016 --> 02:03:02,528
It would

2606
02:03:02,784 --> 02:03:03,296
Be a disaster

2607
02:03:04,064 --> 02:03:05,344
A day or two

2608
02:03:05,856 --> 02:03:11,232
Knock knock that big a deal

2609
02:03:11,488 --> 02:03:12,768
Like

2610
02:03:13,024 --> 02:03:15,072
I think he's a f****** s*** head in Oliver

2611
02:03:15,840 --> 02:03:18,144
But if you waited a day to sign a bill

2612
02:03:18,400 --> 02:03:18,912
Victon

2613
02:03:19,168 --> 02:03:20,448
Matter he waited a day

2614
02:03:20,704 --> 02:03:21,984
I would never be like

2615
02:03:22,496 --> 02:03:23,520
This m***********

2616
02:03:23,776 --> 02:03:25,824
It's not

2617
02:03:26,080 --> 02:03:26,592
What

2618
02:03:26,848 --> 02:03:27,872
To live in the world

2619
02:03:28,128 --> 02:03:34,272
Where that's my problem with Trump

2620
02:03:36,064 --> 02:03:41,952
You can't sign it until a week later

2621
02:03:42,208 --> 02:03:44,768
The issue

2622
02:03:45,024 --> 02:03:45,792
He could sign

2623
02:03:46,304 --> 02:03:46,816
Because him

2624
02:03:47,328 --> 02:03:50,656
And his wife publicly

2625
02:03:50,912 --> 02:03:53,728
At least a is a man

2626
02:03:53,984 --> 02:03:57,824
Valentines

2627
02:04:04,480 --> 02:04:05,760
A joke Venable calls me out on it

2628
02:04:06,784 --> 02:04:12,928
Be my biggest problem

2629
02:04:16,512 --> 02:04:18,304
We're keeping people in

2630
02:04:18,560 --> 02:04:19,328
F****** 10

2631
02:04:19,584 --> 02:04:24,448
What's the fun thing about being children in front of them

2632
02:04:25,472 --> 02:04:26,496
I would love

2633
02:04:30,848 --> 02:04:36,736
It's a fun thing about being a patriot battling ghost

2634
02:04:38,528 --> 02:04:41,344
That is nice kind of know that

2635
02:04:52,608 --> 02:04:54,912
The Patriot movement is a giant group of people saying

2636
02:04:55,168 --> 02:04:58,496
Everybody who hates you

2637
02:05:02,848 --> 02:05:05,408
The spending bill

2638
02:05:05,920 --> 02:05:09,504
Does find photos have your license check

2639
02:05:09,760 --> 02:05:10,272
Donors

2640
02:05:10,528 --> 02:05:11,296
Bruit donated

2641
02:05:11,552 --> 02:05:12,064
The both part

2642
02:05:14,112 --> 02:05:17,440
I guess as the world's slid deeper into depression

2643
02:05:17,696 --> 02:05:20,000
Snipers to braided the fire sale

2644
02:05:20,512 --> 02:05:21,792
That they had created

2645
02:05:22,304 --> 02:05:22,816
I believe

2646
02:05:23,328 --> 02:05:23,840
But again

2647
02:05:32,288 --> 02:05:38,432
It seems like if you hated Sarah so much as he did

2648
02:05:38,688 --> 02:05:39,712
Surahs on PBS

2649
02:05:39,968 --> 02:05:42,272
But I was able

2650
02:05:42,528 --> 02:05:46,112
In your own self

2651
02:05:46,368 --> 02:05:47,392
Go off

2652
02:05:47,648 --> 02:05:51,488
Well I mean like there's been multiple occasions already where his voice-over doesn't match

2653
02:05:51,744 --> 02:05:57,888
What's showing on screen

2654
02:05:58,144 --> 02:05:58,912
No that's the b-roll

2655
02:05:59,168 --> 02:05:59,680
Right

2656
02:05:59,936 --> 02:06:03,264
English the phrase burdens of the office is overstated

2657
02:06:05,568 --> 02:06:11,712
Why did the financial collapse have to have

2658
02:06:11,968 --> 02:06:18,112
On my watch just I don't believe

2659
02:06:18,624 --> 02:06:21,184
The president-elect Obama Beast full of self-pity

2660
02:06:21,440 --> 02:06:23,488
I honestly think that that

2661
02:06:23,744 --> 02:06:27,584
You responded very poorly to that I think that's one of the Bush clips

2662
02:06:27,840 --> 02:06:28,352
But I've seen

2663
02:06:28,608 --> 02:06:30,144
That makes me like him the most

2664
02:06:30,400 --> 02:06:33,984
Yeah

2665
02:06:34,240 --> 02:06:35,520
It sounded like

2666
02:06:35,776 --> 02:06:38,848
He was giving some sort of like

2667
02:06:39,104 --> 02:06:39,872
But he was poking

2668
02:06:43,456 --> 02:06:46,016
He was addressing the idea of the burden of office

2669
02:06:46,272 --> 02:06:47,808
I don't really think

2670
02:06:48,064 --> 02:06:54,208
It's all that. Smith

2671
02:07:02,144 --> 02:07:04,192
Who would take pity on himself

2672
02:07:04,448 --> 02:07:05,472
Wifey f****** things

2673
02:07:05,728 --> 02:07:08,288
Agreed

2674
02:07:08,544 --> 02:07:10,848
Disagree

2675
02:07:11,104 --> 02:07:15,712
But I know that you do my letters only know that letter that every president

2676
02:07:15,968 --> 02:07:20,320
Write to the next president

2677
02:07:20,832 --> 02:07:22,624
His letter is going to be like

2678
02:07:22,880 --> 02:07:26,976
I learn how to write with a cramp and that's it

2679
02:07:27,232 --> 02:07:29,280
F****** God we're all going to die

2680
02:07:31,072 --> 02:07:32,096
I don't know

2681
02:07:32,352 --> 02:07:34,144
I don't want to send

2682
02:07:34,656 --> 02:07:38,240
W foot like the only reason I responded that weighs cuz you were like 5

2683
02:07:42,848 --> 02:07:45,152
I think it's pretty good

2684
02:07:45,408 --> 02:07:49,248
There's a lot of clips of bush in this documentary that are fuckingawesome

2685
02:07:55,648 --> 02:07:56,672
With their access

2686
02:07:56,928 --> 02:07:58,976
2 Unlimited Fiat capital

2687
02:07:59,232 --> 02:08:02,048
They can now buy up sectors of the world economy

2688
02:08:02,304 --> 02:08:04,608
Not already controlled by them

2689
02:08:04,864 --> 02:08:06,656
Likewise over a century

2690
02:08:07,168 --> 02:08:12,032
500

2691
02:08:12,544 --> 02:08:14,080
Artificially engineered

2692
02:08:16,384 --> 02:08:18,432
Address before the trilateral commission

2693
02:08:18,944 --> 02:08:24,576
Terrible graphics

2694
02:08:25,088 --> 02:08:28,672
The super National sovereignty in World Bank

2695
02:08:28,928 --> 02:08:32,512
Is surely preferable to the National termination practice

2696
02:08:33,792 --> 02:08:37,888
Is a higher-quality version right now at prisonplanet.com if you were wondering

2697
02:08:38,400 --> 02:08:44,288
Rockefeller

2698
02:08:44,544 --> 02:08:46,336
Of an old decaying white man

2699
02:08:46,848 --> 02:08:48,128
Prisonplanet.com

2700
02:08:48,384 --> 02:08:49,152
Do you hear that quote

2701
02:08:51,200 --> 02:08:51,712
It wasn't real

2702
02:08:52,480 --> 02:08:52,992
God

2703
02:08:53,504 --> 02:08:54,272
Another fake quote

2704
02:08:54,528 --> 02:08:59,648
God dammit he's talking about the supernationals

2705
02:09:00,416 --> 02:09:03,232
Collaboration of these octagon

2706
02:09:03,744 --> 02:09:09,120
Is definitely preferable to the states

2707
02:09:09,376 --> 02:09:12,192
YouTube video that went around

2708
02:09:12,704 --> 02:09:18,848
Pearson Redwing Circle based

2709
02:09:19,104 --> 02:09:20,128
Video

2710
02:09:20,384 --> 02:09:20,896
Bialy copy

2711
02:09:21,152 --> 02:09:23,456
The speech that Rockefeller gave at Bilderberg

2712
02:09:23,968 --> 02:09:24,736
D91

2713
02:09:24,992 --> 02:09:25,504
But

2714
02:09:25,760 --> 02:09:27,808
If you look at this video it itself says

2715
02:09:28,064 --> 02:09:29,344
Video

2716
02:09:29,600 --> 02:09:30,368
Like on

2717
02:09:30,880 --> 02:09:33,184
The goddamn picture that's on screen

2718
02:09:33,440 --> 02:09:36,256
It is just an image it's not a video

2719
02:09:36,768 --> 02:09:37,792
Is the picture it says

2720
02:09:38,304 --> 02:09:39,328
In parentheses

2721
02:09:39,584 --> 02:09:40,864
Audio simulation

2722
02:09:42,400 --> 02:09:47,008
It is not a recording at all people act like it is

2723
02:09:47,520 --> 02:09:49,056
There's nothing to back this up

2724
02:09:49,568 --> 02:09:50,336
No transcript

2725
02:09:50,592 --> 02:09:52,384
There's nothing

2726
02:09:52,640 --> 02:09:56,992
Start making the rounds until 2 years after

2727
02:09:57,504 --> 02:09:58,784
So my feeling is abs

2728
02:09:59,040 --> 02:09:59,808
Any other time

2729
02:10:01,344 --> 02:10:03,648
Based on all

2730
02:10:03,904 --> 02:10:04,416
Keeps using

2731
02:10:04,928 --> 02:10:06,720
I hope

2732
02:10:08,512 --> 02:10:13,632
Yeah absolutely stupid

2733
02:10:13,888 --> 02:10:17,984
Global business

2734
02:10:18,496 --> 02:10:20,800
Illuminati running

2735
02:10:21,056 --> 02:10:22,848
Worldmaster

2736
02:10:23,104 --> 02:10:25,664
It still wouldn't say they're all so here's what I would say

2737
02:10:26,176 --> 02:10:30,784
I understand that you expect privacy of Bilderberg you know like it just

2738
02:10:31,040 --> 02:10:35,648
They work under Chatham rules House Rules

2739
02:10:35,904 --> 02:10:37,184
The understanding is

2740
02:10:37,440 --> 02:10:37,952
You can

2741
02:10:38,208 --> 02:10:40,256
This is actually really what they go by

2742
02:10:40,512 --> 02:10:42,816
They use this ruleset where

2743
02:10:43,072 --> 02:10:45,120
You can use any information

2744
02:10:45,376 --> 02:10:45,888
That you got

2745
02:10:46,656 --> 02:10:47,680
But you can't talk about

2746
02:10:47,936 --> 02:10:49,472
Do static or anything like that

2747
02:10:49,728 --> 02:10:53,824
I am there if Hilda Berg you and I are there

2748
02:10:54,080 --> 02:10:55,104
Information about bikes

2749
02:10:55,360 --> 02:10:55,872
Thought I have

2750
02:10:56,128 --> 02:10:57,408
Whatever right

2751
02:10:57,920 --> 02:10:59,200
But you can't say that

2752
02:10:59,712 --> 02:11:00,992
I told you that

2753
02:11:01,248 --> 02:11:02,016
There's that

2754
02:11:02,272 --> 02:11:03,040
Christine Fair

2755
02:11:05,600 --> 02:11:08,672
The reason I'm bringing this up is that hike

2756
02:11:13,280 --> 02:11:13,792
In 90

2757
02:11:14,048 --> 02:11:14,560
G91

2758
02:11:16,096 --> 02:11:18,400
Many Bilderberg meetings before that

2759
02:11:18,656 --> 02:11:19,936
Jeez it's not his first time

2760
02:11:20,192 --> 02:11:21,472
He's not some sort of Green rookie

2761
02:11:21,728 --> 02:11:22,496
Rain comes in

2762
02:11:22,752 --> 02:11:24,288
And gives a speech where he says

2763
02:11:24,544 --> 02:11:26,336
Hahaha

2764
02:11:26,592 --> 02:11:28,896
We are used to

2765
02:11:29,664 --> 02:11:30,688
That would be gauche

2766
02:11:31,200 --> 02:11:34,016
But even if

2767
02:11:34,272 --> 02:11:35,552
Why would you f****** say that

2768
02:11:36,832 --> 02:11:42,976
You're only saying it to people who already know that that's what you believe if

2769
02:11:43,488 --> 02:11:46,304
Is the king of the whole thing be like

2770
02:11:46,816 --> 02:11:48,096
Now yours

2771
02:11:48,864 --> 02:11:49,376
Betsy

2772
02:11:49,632 --> 02:11:50,912
F****** stupid well what

2773
02:11:51,168 --> 02:11:53,216
Concerns me is where is the king of lobbyists

2774
02:11:57,312 --> 02:12:01,152
He's not play I don't know

2775
02:12:01,408 --> 02:12:07,552
What is always

2776
02:12:07,808 --> 02:12:08,576
Session rights

2777
02:12:11,136 --> 02:12:13,952
You got it you got to steal one of his client

2778
02:12:14,464 --> 02:12:17,536
Oh no

2779
02:12:18,048 --> 02:12:19,840
He'll require

2780
02:12:20,096 --> 02:12:23,680
Trial by combat

2781
02:12:23,936 --> 02:12:30,080
That's another way to do it

2782
02:12:30,336 --> 02:12:32,128
Ultimately it's

2783
02:12:36,224 --> 02:12:40,576
Everyone's going however

2784
02:12:40,832 --> 02:12:44,928
Cast of House Rules so

2785
02:12:45,184 --> 02:12:49,280
You guys have a fight

2786
02:12:49,536 --> 02:12:52,096
And going to talk about

2787
02:12:52,352 --> 02:12:55,680
Peter chapter blue

2788
02:12:55,936 --> 02:12:57,984
Bring this up is like trying to

2789
02:12:58,240 --> 02:12:58,752
Obtain the fuc

2790
02:12:59,008 --> 02:13:05,152
Good idea

2791
02:13:05,408 --> 02:13:07,968
I welcome Alex to prove

2792
02:13:09,248 --> 02:13:11,552
I will retract everything I said about this

2793
02:13:11,808 --> 02:13:15,136
But I think it's f****** stupid

2794
02:13:15,392 --> 02:13:16,928
Well I'm saying

2795
02:13:17,184 --> 02:13:18,720
I make a decorations

2796
02:13:19,232 --> 02:13:20,256
Thought well hey

2797
02:13:21,024 --> 02:13:22,304
I would say I would say

2798
02:13:22,560 --> 02:13:23,072
There's no way

2799
02:13:23,328 --> 02:13:24,352
Doesn't come back

2800
02:13:24,608 --> 02:13:25,120
Text Daniel

2801
02:13:25,888 --> 02:13:26,656
And if that's okay

2802
02:13:27,936 --> 02:13:28,704
I say

2803
02:13:28,960 --> 02:13:29,472
Get that

2804
02:13:31,008 --> 02:13:33,312
We have all been held Within

2805
02:13:34,080 --> 02:13:34,592
The

2806
02:13:36,128 --> 02:13:37,408
Jail cell of that Ponyta

2807
02:13:38,688 --> 02:13:39,456
That jail

2808
02:13:47,648 --> 02:13:52,768
And that is where we will have to cut it off for today I hope you all enjoyed yet another

2809
02:13:53,024 --> 02:13:54,304
Spurious quote

2810
02:13:54,560 --> 02:13:57,120
That Alex is peddling as if it's real

2811
02:13:57,376 --> 02:14:00,192
What a shock there's this documentary is lousy with Alex

2812
02:14:00,448 --> 02:14:01,216
Just making sure it up

2813
02:14:01,472 --> 02:14:03,264
But we will be back

2814
02:14:03,520 --> 02:14:05,056
Tomorrow

2815
02:14:05,312 --> 02:14:08,128
For the conclusion does thrilling conclusion

2816
02:14:08,640 --> 02:14:11,200
Of The Obama Deception coverage

2817
02:14:11,456 --> 02:14:15,296
Ask the point where I have given up caring about this

2818
02:14:17,600 --> 02:14:20,928
Not a proud moment for me to have put on

2819
02:14:21,184 --> 02:14:22,464
Semitic Idol really

2820
02:14:22,720 --> 02:14:27,840
Give a s*** about Alex's even saying anymore

2821
02:14:28,096 --> 02:14:30,400
I will see how it plays out for the conclusion

2822
02:14:30,656 --> 02:14:35,008
Thank you so much for joining us on this adventure I know it's a lot

2823
02:14:35,520 --> 02:14:36,800
It's a lot

2824
02:14:37,056 --> 02:14:42,432
But I figured why do people out there probably have travel over the holidays

2825
