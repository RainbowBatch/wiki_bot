00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:45,216
Legal mumbo-jumbo.

16
00:01:45,472 --> 00:01:47,776
The deal with it's good that she's out

17
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:52,896
Truly horrifying travesty that she was ever

18
00:01:53,408 --> 00:01:55,712
Like she is maybe created

19
00:01:56,224 --> 00:01:59,808
Alright what's up

20
00:02:02,112 --> 00:02:03,904
She could commit two murders

21
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,952
And still be better than the replace

22
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,488

38
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:11,744
Falsely took responsibility for something

I got a message from 8

40
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:21,984

41
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,776

42
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:25,312
Because they look like they're fantastic

43
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:28,128

Occasionally

85
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:51,999
There could be a revised

86
00:05:56,863 --> 00:05:58,655
I don't know about plum

87
00:05:58,911 --> 00:06:04,543

95
00:06:28,095 --> 00:06:28,607
The lowest

96
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:35,007
Dogs eat grapefruit

97
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:37,567
Summer was really good

98
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:38,591

106
00:07:07,519 --> 00:07:08,031
You know

107
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:12,127
Alex is Special Report that he put out on Saturday

108
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:14,175
I felt like it was It was kind of

109
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:16,735
Perfunctory

110
00:07:16,991 --> 00:07:20,575
Yeah it was lacking a little bit of his show

111
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:22,879
Let's give him another

112
00:07:23,391 --> 00:07:29,535
Let's pretend he's coming back from vacation on Sunday

113
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:34,911
Come back in here

114
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:37,727
I might have also covered Mondays episode

115
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:40,543

116
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:43,103

00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:45,151

Gary Moore wife

119
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:49,759
Google realizes like our show is essentially

120
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:52,831
If you listen to somebody like a commentator anybody

121
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:59,231
Soros is a Nazi collaborator

122
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:08,447
Flags

123
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:15,103
What if we kept listening to people after

124
00:08:15,359 --> 00:08:16,383

Generosity

00:10:04,927 --> 00:10:06,719
Local charities that help

152
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:07,487
People in need

153
00:10:07,743 --> 00:10:08,255
What

154
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:13,887
Jordan we start here on Sunday

155
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:18,495
And we pretended that was a disaster on Saturday

156
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:21,311
Just a little groggy

157
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:25,919
Have you start complaining

158
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:28,991
Police dogs

Stock price

160
00:10:30,783 --> 00:10:33,087
Sinclair says

161
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:36,671
Featuring conspiracy theory

162
00:10:49,727 --> 00:10:51,775
Jana function transfers

163
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:53,823
Nice Coronavirus

164
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:57,663
During the Obama Administration

165
00:10:58,175 --> 00:11:02,527
Here's what happened with Sinclair the end of last week that Alex's Now cover

166
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:03,807
Did it

167
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:08,671
So Eric Bolling didn't episode of his show where he interviewed woman from plandemic

168
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:09,951
Make Judy avocado

169
00:11:10,463 --> 00:11:12,511
And they did a ridiculous conspiracy

170
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:15,327
Dr. fauci created covid

171
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:17,631
It was straight up Infowars

172
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:21,727
Good about it when they shop

173
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:25,311
Infowars

174
00:11:25,567 --> 00:11:28,127
Oliver Darcy at CNN

175
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:33,503
Darcy wrote an article on CNN embarrassing this episode of bowling show

176
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:36,575
Sinclair decided to postpone the episode

177
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:37,343
Reworking

178
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:43,743
Something embarrassing that's crazy

179
00:11:45,023 --> 00:11:47,583
Stan Sinclair

180
00:11:50,655 --> 00:11:51,167
Sudu Delano

181
00:11:55,263 --> 00:11:57,567
Segmented we're just going to shelf the entire thing and not are

182
00:11:58,591 --> 00:12:04,735
Not appropriate

183
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:07,551
The interview

184
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:11,647
We were really excited to are the stuff that we believe

185
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:12,415
104

186
00:12:12,927 --> 00:12:14,207
But you guys realized

187
00:12:14,463 --> 00:12:18,303
She's crazy so more than our lives

188
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:23,935
This is just an example of a brat

189
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:28,543
Which is another Infowars

190
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:33,919
Tell them not to are the piece that's just dumb Spanish

191
00:12:34,175 --> 00:12:35,455
Possible for him to report

192
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:38,783
And Reporting on this story is going to be a challenge for him

193
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:40,831
And the reason for that actually has

194
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:43,135
Soda bowling show

195
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:46,207
Alex has to be insupportable covid

196
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:48,767
Because she stridently anti-vaccine

197
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:51,071
Please brighten all the covid-19 conspiracy

198
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:53,119
Right now

199
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:56,959
However the other program is going to be an issue

200
00:12:57,471 --> 00:13:01,311
The other guests was mikovits his lawyer Larry klayman

201
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:09,247
The Bad Penny that keeps showing up

202
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:14,623
You don't keep up with our sundry weirdos and populate Alex's world

203
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:19,487
Larry klayman was a friend of Alex's back the Obama bashing

204
00:13:19,743 --> 00:13:21,023
They become bitter enemies

205
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:27,423
Most recently claiming along with Jerome corsi is filed the defamation lawsuit against

206
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,799
I see going down between allies

207
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:35,871
Alex is going to have to somehow dance around the fact

208
00:13:36,127 --> 00:13:36,639
The claimant is

209
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:37,919
Makoto's lawyer

210
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:44,575
From ever appearing on

211
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:45,855
Those is very sad

212
00:13:46,111 --> 00:13:48,415
And honestly I'm super bummed out that I

213
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:51,487
I know about the interpersonal dynamics of these con artists

214
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:54,047
It's like I see her on

215
00:13:54,303 --> 00:13:57,119
Bowling show with claiming as her like

216
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:00,191
Do you know about the

217
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:01,983
Complicated interpersonal

218
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:03,007
Between character

219
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:04,031
Degrassi

220
00:14:04,543 --> 00:14:05,311
Let's

221
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:06,591
Let's leave the

222
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:10,687
My reality TV show con artists and their lawyers

223
00:14:10,943 --> 00:14:12,735
What is Houtzdale

224
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:16,319
That's way better than leg of your Real Housewives of Beverly Hills

225
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:21,439
It's hard to find people

226
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:23,743
Sure this is an isolating

227
00:14:25,023 --> 00:14:30,655
Ivar's

228
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:32,447
Socially

229
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:37,823
AuctionZip

230
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:42,431
Claiming that for clients for the also can't practice law for 90 days

231
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:44,991
Yeah

232
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:49,087
And I got to go I don't know

233
00:14:49,343 --> 00:14:51,135
So

234
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:51,903
About it yet

235
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:55,999
But Alex get to talkin about

236
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:56,767
He's about

237
00:14:58,303 --> 00:15:00,607
Sinclair should be airing this

238
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:03,679
Truth and so Alex our tattoos

239
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:07,519
Like sort of Beats is waypoints that he goes to in order

240
00:15:09,055 --> 00:15:10,079
Conspiracies

241
00:15:10,591 --> 00:15:13,407
445

242
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:17,503
Function transfers of

243
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:19,551
Nice Coronavirus

244
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:23,391
During the Obama Administration

245
00:15:31,071 --> 00:15:33,631
Liftfund

246
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:34,911
Action research

247
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:36,191
Got them

248
00:15:37,983 --> 00:15:39,263
That's

249
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:41,567
The program development guide

250
00:15:44,383 --> 00:15:47,711
Who is not as much as he wants to

251
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:54,623
This is a real post on the nih's website and title correctly

252
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:56,415
The date is December 19th

253
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:57,695
2017

254
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:03,327
Which Falls just outside

255
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:04,095
Technically

256
00:16:04,351 --> 00:16:06,143
Play on January 20th 27th

257
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:08,191
And December

258
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:08,959
27

259
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:10,239
Is

260
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:13,311
Obama's been president this whole time

261
00:16:13,823 --> 00:16:14,335
No Doubt

262
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:22,015
Obama's administration

263
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:23,039
Does nothing

264
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:26,111
This article begins

265
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:33,279
October 2014 on Gano function

266
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:36,607
Experiment involving influenza SARS and MERS virus

267
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:38,911
Function research is important

268
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:43,007
And helping us identify understand it developed

269
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:46,847
Against rapidly evolving pathogens they pose a threat to Public Health

270
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:49,663
The funding pause was listed in response to

271
00:16:49,919 --> 00:16:53,247
Today's release of the Department of Health and Human Services

272
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:55,295
For guidance decisions

273
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:57,087
About proposed research

274
00:16:57,343 --> 00:16:58,111
Enhance potential

275
00:16:58,367 --> 00:16:59,135
Pandemic Passage

276
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:03,487
If you go and read that paper from the Department of Health and Human Services

277
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:05,279
Immediately

278
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:07,327
The first is a

279
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:12,703
Was Eric Horgan

280
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:13,983
It is term as president

281
00:17:14,239 --> 00:17:15,775
Now that was December 27th

282
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:19,103
An office in January 20th

283
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:22,175
So I assume that must be the first person that you

284
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:32,415
It was only 11 months difference between for at least a year

285
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:33,439
Right then

286
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:37,023
The department of HHS which is

287
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:38,815
Executive

288
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:40,095
Branch of the government

289
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:42,655
Trump is in charge of

290
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:46,239
Which has led to the NIH

291
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:48,287
Traces back

292
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:49,055
To Trump

293
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:50,847
The second thing you notice

294
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:52,639
Never jump

295
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:54,943
Bajor enable creating a bioweapon

296
00:17:55,711 --> 00:18:00,575
Matches up with Alex

297
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:01,855
Theories is just life of

298
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:08,255
The third thing that jumps out here is that there's an entire section in this document this framework about oversight

299
00:18:08,767 --> 00:18:10,559
Any research that was funded because of the

300
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:14,399
This lifting of the pause was subject to review by the Department of Health and Human Services

301
00:18:15,167 --> 00:18:19,263
The Anthony that was funding the research would report on their intention to the HHS

302
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:22,079
And the office of Science and Technology policy

303
00:18:25,663 --> 00:18:30,527
DHHS Woodland quotes

304
00:18:30,783 --> 00:18:34,623
Including suggestions for additional risk mitigation measures and or

305
00:18:34,879 --> 00:18:36,159
Terms and conditions of award

306
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:37,183
If fundit

307
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:40,255
This is where it's just at

308
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:42,047
Huge problem for Alex if he doesn't read the

309
00:18:42,303 --> 00:18:42,815
Things past headline

310
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:45,887
He hasn't NIH headline that he thinks of smoking

311
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:49,983
Gone but literally everything about this doesn't match

312
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:53,567
Any actual Source he's pointing to really complicates the narrative

313
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:59,455
What you understand

314
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:03,039
It becomes comical to imagine

315
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:06,111
There be so many people it would have to be in on this

316
00:19:06,367 --> 00:19:08,159
Impossibly long paper trail

317
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:11,487
The headline sounds good that's all that matters

318
00:19:16,351 --> 00:19:16,863
I work

319
00:19:17,631 --> 00:19:20,703
Please approve my research into a bioweapon

320
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:21,471
I would

321
00:19:21,727 --> 00:19:23,263
Address this to the head of the h.h.

322
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:24,543
AHS but unfortunately

323
00:19:25,055 --> 00:19:27,615
Don't know who wouldn't know which one

324
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:28,895
Heart

325
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:34,271
Workout I think it actually kind of

326
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:35,039
Great works

327
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:36,575
Against

328
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:40,927
He has more than one headlight

329
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:41,951
Music

330
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:47,071
Coronavirus research

331
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:49,887
With Heroes using

332
00:19:50,399 --> 00:19:51,679
Applies batbot

333
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:57,311
So important

334
00:19:58,591 --> 00:20:04,735
Headline News

335
00:20:04,991 --> 00:20:05,503
U.s. dollars

336
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:07,039
For risky coronavirus research

337
00:20:08,063 --> 00:20:09,855
It didn't add the part about chimeras

338
00:20:10,111 --> 00:20:11,391
Chimera virus

339
00:20:11,647 --> 00:20:15,231
Little bit

340
00:20:15,743 --> 00:20:21,887
Okay comparing the real headline to the one Alex's report doesn't feel like this story is Juicy enough on it

341
00:20:22,143 --> 00:20:24,703
Sexier

342
00:20:25,215 --> 00:20:26,751
Chimera

343
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:29,823
These stories mostly about research going back to 24

344
00:20:30,079 --> 00:20:31,103
Yelp

345
00:20:31,615 --> 00:20:32,895
Which involved

346
00:20:33,407 --> 00:20:35,199
True

347
00:20:35,455 --> 00:20:41,087
Catalog

348
00:20:41,343 --> 00:20:42,879
Coronavirus

349
00:20:43,647 --> 00:20:48,511
In 2019 they began doing some gain a function study at all related to

350
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:49,279
19

351
00:20:49,535 --> 00:20:53,375
And again the NIH has only able to find Gaynor function research

352
00:20:53,887 --> 00:20:59,007
In this case because the framework it was put up by the Department of Health and Human Services

353
00:20:59,263 --> 00:21:01,311
It is true that sound she supports gay defunct

354
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:02,079
To research

355
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:04,639
Debate about whether or not the risk

356
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:06,175
Outweigh the potential breakthrough

357
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:07,455
Conversation

358
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:09,759
It's not the conversation Alex

359
00:21:15,391 --> 00:21:18,720
Alex just has a headline with nothing

360
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:22,304
And it doesn't even match up with what he

361
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:28,192
Bike it's just really annoying to listen to him try to make point

362
00:21:28,448 --> 00:21:29,216
It's because it's

363
00:21:29,472 --> 00:21:30,496
So much just

364
00:21:30,752 --> 00:21:31,520
S*** talk

365
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:37,152
I'm just reading headlines being like really

366
00:21:37,408 --> 00:21:37,920
Understand how you

367
00:21:38,176 --> 00:21:39,200
Can just read headlines

368
00:21:39,456 --> 00:21:40,480
As if that proves your

369
00:21:40,992 --> 00:21:47,136
Editorialize

370
00:21:47,392 --> 00:21:48,672
Virus in the

371
00:21:48,928 --> 00:21:54,816
Bat lab and so now you killing everybody

372
00:21:55,072 --> 00:21:57,376
It's almost paradise

373
00:21:57,632 --> 00:21:59,424
It really is

374
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:00,960
Not but instead

375
00:22:01,216 --> 00:22:03,520
The same as the people who run the governor

376
00:22:07,872 --> 00:22:09,408
Getting into race

377
00:22:09,664 --> 00:22:10,688
Issued

378
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:14,784
Feeling a little bit to do that

379
00:22:17,856 --> 00:22:18,368
Every

380
00:22:18,624 --> 00:22:19,136
Turn

381
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:22,976
Correct

382
00:22:23,488 --> 00:22:24,256
Yes look at it

383
00:22:26,048 --> 00:22:26,560
What about it

384
00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:33,984
Knight takes black pain because that could be seen as racist

385
00:22:41,408 --> 00:22:42,688
That's the level of the

386
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:44,992
How do them

387
00:22:45,248 --> 00:22:46,016
So much

388
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:47,296
/ so long

389
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,344
Think we're

390
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:50,368
Going to buy

391
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:51,648
To them again

392
00:22:52,416 --> 00:22:52,928
Forever

393
00:23:00,096 --> 00:23:02,912
Did you just give me an Infowars article

394
00:23:03,168 --> 00:23:05,472
Without a citation

395
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:09,568
This is a story that Alex is completely misrepresented

396
00:23:09,824 --> 00:23:15,968
He's a version of it is

397
00:23:16,224 --> 00:23:16,992
Takes a black pot

398
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:23,904
The actual story is that this is based on is about a it's a sydney-based ABC affiliate they were working on

399
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:26,720
Exploring the idea that Jesse's intrinsically races

400
00:23:26,976 --> 00:23:30,816
Just because traditionally the white pieces always get the first move

401
00:23:31,584 --> 00:23:35,936
This came to public attention on June 22nd when Australian chest figured

402
00:23:36,192 --> 00:23:37,472
Tweeted about being approached

403
00:23:37,728 --> 00:23:39,008
Or comment for the segment

404
00:23:39,264 --> 00:23:40,800
Which he responded to without Ray

405
00:23:41,824 --> 00:23:43,616
From what I can tell about the segment it was

406
00:23:44,128 --> 00:23:47,200
Does an exploration of whether or not this was something that had races

407
00:23:50,016 --> 00:23:51,296
Without any bias at all

408
00:23:51,552 --> 00:23:52,320
Is this

409
00:23:55,136 --> 00:23:59,232
Already know or people out

410
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:01,536
Traditionally chess always

411
00:24:01,792 --> 00:24:03,840
Pieces Coronavirus

412
00:24:04,096 --> 00:24:07,168
It was meant to be a supplement to a conversation that was happening about things

413
00:24:07,424 --> 00:24:08,448
Things like the name of the washer

414
00:24:08,704 --> 00:24:09,472
Canton football team

415
00:24:09,984 --> 00:24:12,544
Wasn't meant to be direct at Construction

416
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,592
They are not going to want to hear about

417
00:24:14,848 --> 00:24:15,616
Go

418
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:18,944
Oh yeah

419
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:25,344
ABC anchor who's working on this story

420
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:26,112
As follows

421
00:24:26,624 --> 00:24:27,904
He saw a tweet from a parrot

422
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,440
Who was musing about wide

423
00:24:29,696 --> 00:24:31,488
The white pieces always go first

424
00:24:31,744 --> 00:24:34,304
Nissan Quest received from his child

425
00:24:34,816 --> 00:24:39,424
He didn't know why that was a tradition

426
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,960
And as part of that is produced

427
00:24:41,216 --> 00:24:43,776
Has reached out to various experts in Australia

428
00:24:44,032 --> 00:24:45,056
Including this John Adams

429
00:24:46,336 --> 00:24:48,896
Atoms are working on a story with the angle that

430
00:24:49,152 --> 00:24:49,920
The chassis

431
00:24:50,944 --> 00:24:55,040
The ABC of taking the view that Jesse's racist given that white always goes first

432
00:24:55,296 --> 00:25:00,928
They're seeking comment from a chess official as to whether the rules of Chess need to be altered!

433
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:05,792
Valentine responded in a Facebook post I haven't decided the chest as races

434
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:06,816
I'm not looking

435
00:25:07,072 --> 00:25:07,840
For someone to say

436
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:09,632
I'm looking

437
00:25:09,888 --> 00:25:10,400
To create

438
00:25:10,656 --> 00:25:12,704
Some conversation that will be fresh and

439
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:13,984
Keep someone interested

440
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,288
Tell me something more about the world

441
00:25:16,544 --> 00:25:17,824
And why it is the way it is

442
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,360
This is a 0

443
00:25:19,616 --> 00:25:24,480
Another example

444
00:25:24,736 --> 00:25:27,296
In order to amplify victimhood narrative

445
00:25:28,064 --> 00:25:31,392
Sirius broadcaster with the level of importance that Alex pretends he

446
00:25:35,232 --> 00:25:39,328
The version that Alex is telling

447
00:25:39,584 --> 00:25:40,608
Isn't the same as my react

448
00:25:41,376 --> 00:25:43,168
To knowledge that I don't

449
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:44,448
No

450
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:45,728
Which is like

451
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,008
Why is that

452
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,312
I would like someone to explain that to me

453
00:25:49,568 --> 00:25:50,848
Or I can go look it up right

454
00:25:51,104 --> 00:25:52,384
Right now instead of just being like

455
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:54,432
Seether go out of control

456
00:25:54,688 --> 00:25:57,504
I was going to explain

457
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:03,136
The story is not really as interesting

458
00:26:03,648 --> 00:26:09,792
I would like it to be for me to tell you

459
00:26:10,048 --> 00:26:10,816
Going first naked

460
00:26:11,072 --> 00:26:13,632
Choose their colors

461
00:26:13,888 --> 00:26:20,032
Standardized it in some way so this is an easier way for us to just be like

462
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:22,080
This time black

463
00:26:22,336 --> 00:26:25,920
Jason has to be altered if it was more or less arbitrary

464
00:26:27,456 --> 00:26:33,600
Eastlake

465
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:37,696
Conscious

466
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,560
From what I can tell it doesn't

467
00:26:42,816 --> 00:26:43,328
Bmike

468
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:45,632
You know we've uncovered any deeply

469
00:26:45,888 --> 00:26:47,424
Racist story here

470
00:26:47,936 --> 00:26:49,728
Now somehow I feel like a fellow might

471
00:26:49,984 --> 00:26:52,032
Might be racist because

472
00:26:59,200 --> 00:26:59,712
Poorly

473
00:26:59,968 --> 00:27:00,992
Is that a guy

474
00:27:01,248 --> 00:27:05,856
Misrepresentation of a plant ABC Sydney story about the history of jazz

475
00:27:06,112 --> 00:27:08,672
Got really mad about

476
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,256
They are not hard to rile up

477
00:27:12,512 --> 00:27:13,024
No

478
00:27:14,048 --> 00:27:14,816
Not now it doesn't take much

479
00:27:15,072 --> 00:27:17,376
Bears

480
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:20,448
Surrounding

481
00:27:21,984 --> 00:27:23,776
There's things that are going on

482
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:28,896
Portland still

483
00:27:29,408 --> 00:27:33,760
Richmond

484
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:38,368
There was a guy who shot

485
00:27:39,136 --> 00:27:39,904
At our protest

486
00:27:42,208 --> 00:27:43,488
In order to

487
00:27:43,744 --> 00:27:47,328
He's into that topic Alex has to discuss another

488
00:27:48,352 --> 00:27:49,632
Who was killed

489
00:27:55,008 --> 00:27:56,032
What does pledge

490
00:27:56,288 --> 00:27:57,568
Will be murder

491
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,872
This person who died

492
00:28:00,128 --> 00:28:00,640
Alex doesn't

493
00:28:00,896 --> 00:28:02,176
Say his name

494
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:04,224
Did the care about anything other than the optic

495
00:28:05,248 --> 00:28:07,296
He's a black Trump supporters

496
00:28:07,552 --> 00:28:13,696
Is named know whatever the circumstances surrounding it

497
00:28:13,952 --> 00:28:15,232
I know it's awful

498
00:28:15,488 --> 00:28:19,072
Murder and should be treated as such

499
00:28:20,608 --> 00:28:22,400
Misreporting going on to it

500
00:28:22,656 --> 00:28:24,448
At least at this point

501
00:28:24,704 --> 00:28:27,776
It's unclear whether this guy was murdered because

502
00:28:28,032 --> 00:28:30,336
Support for Trump or something else

503
00:28:30,592 --> 00:28:33,152
Right there isn't any reason

504
00:28:33,408 --> 00:28:39,296
Should be reporting this as that other than

505
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:41,344
Reporting it very concretely

506
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:44,672
That it was in retaliation for supporting

507
00:28:44,928 --> 00:28:45,440
He saying it

508
00:28:47,232 --> 00:28:51,072
Making a bigger deal out of this is in order to

509
00:28:52,096 --> 00:28:52,864
Helped

510
00:28:53,632 --> 00:28:54,144
From the fact

511
00:28:55,936 --> 00:28:58,496
In Austin in his own City

512
00:28:59,008 --> 00:29:00,544
There is a very clear-cut case

513
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,336
Of someone

514
00:29:02,848 --> 00:29:05,152
Was protester who Alex shoot support

515
00:29:05,664 --> 00:29:06,432
Who was murdered

516
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,552
B-47

517
00:29:12,064 --> 00:29:14,112
He said he got 47

518
00:29:22,048 --> 00:29:23,584
First

519
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:24,864
Listen to what

520
00:29:26,656 --> 00:29:27,936
Why

521
00:29:31,776 --> 00:29:32,544
You talk about

522
00:29:34,336 --> 00:29:34,848
And stupid

523
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,920
Walking

524
00:29:41,248 --> 00:29:44,576
Information.com

525
00:29:44,832 --> 00:29:47,136
Here's what he said about 10 minutes before

526
00:29:47,392 --> 00:29:48,928
He ran out with the mob.

527
00:29:50,976 --> 00:29:51,744
Somebody

528
00:29:52,256 --> 00:29:52,768
Shot

529
00:29:54,048 --> 00:30:00,192
AK-47

530
00:30:39,616 --> 00:30:41,408
Great purchasing we're so

531
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,712
I'm not sure what Alex thinks

532
00:30:43,968 --> 00:30:45,248
Demonstration proves

533
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:51,904
There was a guy saying police were arresting people expressing their right to assemble

534
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:53,696
12 exercises

535
00:30:54,208 --> 00:30:58,304
He didn't say that he was planning on shooting anyone and Alex would be reporting this very different

536
00:30:59,072 --> 00:31:01,376
He was reported he was protesting for

537
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:05,472
Questionnaires twenty-eight-year-old Garrett Foster

538
00:31:05,728 --> 00:31:07,520
Google shark killed by a driver

539
00:31:07,776 --> 00:31:09,312
In Austin on Saturday

540
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:15,712
Witnesses have been pretty Universal in their telling of the story that the driver was the instigator and aggressor in the situation

541
00:31:16,224 --> 00:31:16,992
Accusation

542
00:31:17,248 --> 00:31:19,808
They Foster shot at the driver

543
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:21,856
Their drivers only firing and selfie

544
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:29,024
In reality protesters didn't really even surround the guys car which was another accusation is made to justify for

545
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:29,792
Foster's murder

546
00:31:30,304 --> 00:31:32,608
Videos have been released which clearly show the

547
00:31:32,864 --> 00:31:35,424
The guy in a car turning at

548
00:31:35,936 --> 00:31:37,728
Specifically where Marchers were crossing

549
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:41,056
The protesters were marching in the intersection is blocked

550
00:31:41,312 --> 00:31:43,360
Which is inconvenient but this driver drove

551
00:31:43,616 --> 00:31:44,384
An accelerated

552
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:45,920
Specifically into a group

553
00:31:46,688 --> 00:31:47,200
Which is

554
00:31:47,456 --> 00:31:47,968
Completely onyx

555
00:31:48,992 --> 00:31:50,272
According to New York Magazine

556
00:31:51,552 --> 00:31:57,440
Police say that they fired on Foster

557
00:31:57,952 --> 00:32:00,768
Reports about whether or not Foster

558
00:32:02,304 --> 00:32:06,144
Witnesses have told reporters that Foster kept his rifle pointed at the ground as he approached

559
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:06,912
The vehicle

560
00:32:07,168 --> 00:32:10,752
Protester carrying a firearm at the March

561
00:32:11,264 --> 00:32:13,056
They say that the driver pointed a handgun

562
00:32:13,312 --> 00:32:14,848
Through the car window inspired at sauce

563
00:32:16,128 --> 00:32:17,920
There were apparently two people who fired weapon

564
00:32:22,272 --> 00:32:24,576
The first person who appeared to a fire was the driver

565
00:32:24,832 --> 00:32:26,112
And then the second person

566
00:32:26,368 --> 00:32:27,136
Not Foster

567
00:32:27,392 --> 00:32:30,720
Directions to open fire at the car as it drove away

568
00:32:31,488 --> 00:32:35,072
This is a tragic story and there's no reason to Garrett Foster should be dead right now

569
00:32:35,584 --> 00:32:36,608
Justified

570
00:32:36,864 --> 00:32:37,632
Is killing is ghoulish

571
00:32:37,888 --> 00:32:39,168
To say nothing of how much

572
00:32:39,424 --> 00:32:39,936
This implicate

573
00:32:40,192 --> 00:32:40,960
Recent calls into question

574
00:32:41,216 --> 00:32:43,776
Is belief in a citizen's right to bear arms

575
00:32:44,288 --> 00:32:48,640
Like this is Bishop White Citizens right to bear arms

576
00:32:50,432 --> 00:32:53,248
Groceries white understand

577
00:32:54,016 --> 00:32:55,040
I don't understand

578
00:32:56,064 --> 00:33:00,928
It's because he was there for a

579
00:33:03,232 --> 00:33:06,304
That's so f*** that second amendment is actually negotiable

580
00:33:06,816 --> 00:33:07,584
Alex which is

581
00:33:08,096 --> 00:33:13,216
Maybe one of the things that we were considering the last Domino that could possibly fall

582
00:33:15,776 --> 00:33:20,896
It turns out that if you have different political beliefs from him

583
00:33:21,152 --> 00:33:22,944
The most essential

584
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,480
But Alex believes American

585
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:29,600
And make you look like

586
00:33:29,856 --> 00:33:31,136
The person news

587
00:33:31,392 --> 00:33:32,160
You've been killed

588
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:34,464
You're not in order

589
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:35,232
To get around that

590
00:33:35,744 --> 00:33:39,072
So he doesn't have to defend

591
00:33:39,328 --> 00:33:40,096
2BR

592
00:33:40,864 --> 00:33:41,888
In his state

593
00:33:42,144 --> 00:33:43,936
In his home state hometown

594
00:33:44,448 --> 00:33:44,960
Yeah

595
00:33:45,472 --> 00:33:49,312
I have no idea what Alex is talking about when he says that he looked into foster and that either

596
00:33:49,568 --> 00:33:50,080
Creep

597
00:33:50,336 --> 00:33:52,128
I looked into it I just don't know what

598
00:33:52,384 --> 00:33:53,408
You could be talking about

599
00:33:53,664 --> 00:33:54,944
And one of the only things that keeps

600
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:55,968
Coming up

601
00:33:56,224 --> 00:33:59,040
Seems like something Alex will be referring to in all of the coverage

602
00:33:59,552 --> 00:34:01,856
Is that you was at the protest with his black

603
00:34:02,112 --> 00:34:03,648
A quadriplegic fiance

604
00:34:04,416 --> 00:34:06,720
Foster and fiance been together since they were seven

605
00:34:07,232 --> 00:34:10,048
And in 2011 she came down with a condition

606
00:34:10,304 --> 00:34:12,608
And required her arms and legs

607
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:16,192
He's taking care of her and quote Foster's mother quote

608
00:34:16,448 --> 00:34:17,216
You love that woman on

609
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:17,984
Unconditionally

610
00:34:18,752 --> 00:34:19,776
I can find no reason

611
00:34:21,568 --> 00:34:23,104
Alex Deeds to justify this

612
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:25,920
Does I have to assume

613
00:34:26,176 --> 00:34:27,200
Then Alex thinks

614
00:34:27,712 --> 00:34:28,224
There's something

615
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,504
Intrinsically weird

616
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:30,528
Or wrong

617
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:31,552
About

618
00:34:32,832 --> 00:34:37,696
Did this guy Mis-Education or the fact that she was quadriplegic

619
00:34:40,768 --> 00:34:42,816
It whatever it is really f***** up

620
00:34:43,328 --> 00:34:43,840
I don't

621
00:34:44,608 --> 00:34:45,888
It is

622
00:34:46,144 --> 00:34:47,168
It is never

623
00:34:48,192 --> 00:34:49,472
I wish we had never even

624
00:34:49,728 --> 00:34:51,008
Speculated on whether or not there was

625
00:34:51,776 --> 00:34:53,312
Like

626
00:34:53,824 --> 00:34:56,128
First episode we should have been like

627
00:34:56,384 --> 00:34:59,712
Just so everybody knows no matter how long this podcast goes

628
00:34:59,968 --> 00:35:00,480
No matter what

629
00:35:00,736 --> 00:35:01,248
Changes

630
00:35:01,504 --> 00:35:02,784
Alex has no bottom

631
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:05,856
Alex believes in nothing

632
00:35:07,392 --> 00:35:08,416
That's what I would do if I was

633
00:35:08,672 --> 00:35:09,952
The time traveler killing Hitler

634
00:35:12,256 --> 00:35:14,048
Tell me to say something

635
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:15,840
I mean

636
00:35:16,096 --> 00:35:16,864
Be bad for us

637
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:18,400
Because I think that

638
00:35:18,656 --> 00:35:19,168
We would have stopped

639
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:20,192
Maybe

640
00:35:22,752 --> 00:35:23,264
And like the

641
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:24,288
Disgust is earned

642
00:35:24,544 --> 00:35:25,312
You know like

643
00:35:25,568 --> 00:35:27,104
Because there was benefits

644
00:35:28,896 --> 00:35:30,176
Along the way is like

645
00:35:30,432 --> 00:35:31,456
We didn't know

646
00:35:33,248 --> 00:35:35,552
We suck as much as he does

647
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:42,464
Experience

648
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:49,632
Constantly get more disappointed

649
00:35:53,728 --> 00:35:54,752
Yeah I can't imagine

650
00:35:55,008 --> 00:35:55,776
Starting out

651
00:35:56,288 --> 00:35:59,872
Show being like we talked about a man who doesn't believe in

652
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:03,456
Yeah like that would be a real boy

653
00:36:06,016 --> 00:36:06,528
Could do

654
00:36:06,784 --> 00:36:07,296
So

655
00:36:07,552 --> 00:36:10,624
There is likely going to be developments on this story

656
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:14,208
Fire weapons will end up being charged

657
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:15,232
Yeah I don't know

658
00:36:15,488 --> 00:36:17,536
But for now the available information

659
00:36:17,792 --> 00:36:18,304
Anyways

660
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:20,096
Support Alex's reporting on this story

661
00:36:20,608 --> 00:36:23,680
He's just providing coverage that justifies the killing of a protester on

662
00:36:25,472 --> 00:36:29,056
To prop up that justification which is

663
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:30,080
Probably the most

664
00:36:30,336 --> 00:36:32,896
Cowardly and hypocritical thing I can imagine

665
00:36:33,152 --> 00:36:34,432
I need to be deeply ashamed of himself

666
00:36:34,944 --> 00:36:39,040
You should be getting protested by all the gun weirdos that have been his allies

667
00:36:39,552 --> 00:36:41,088
For the entire time of his career

668
00:36:41,344 --> 00:36:45,184
Larry Pratt 100%

669
00:36:46,976 --> 00:36:50,304
Should be showing up at Alex's house telling his rifle

670
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:51,584
You bet or whatever

671
00:36:52,864 --> 00:36:56,192
Nonsensical you might as well say I'm advocating for gun control just

672
00:36:58,752 --> 00:37:04,128
Forever

673
00:37:04,384 --> 00:37:07,456
This whole thing if you believe in Alex you know

674
00:37:07,712 --> 00:37:10,272
Believe in the 2nd Amendment nothing

675
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:11,552
Nothing

676
00:37:17,184 --> 00:37:17,696
Is gone at these

677
00:37:17,952 --> 00:37:18,464
These folks

678
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:20,768
Car in order to jump

679
00:37:24,864 --> 00:37:26,400
It's interesting how that isn't

680
00:37:26,656 --> 00:37:28,448
Apply to the people

681
00:37:29,728 --> 00:37:33,568
Sewer pointing guns at protesters

682
00:37:38,432 --> 00:37:39,712
Well I'm sure

683
00:37:39,968 --> 00:37:40,992
I'm sure you wouldn't

684
00:37:47,392 --> 00:37:48,416
There's Austin

685
00:37:50,208 --> 00:37:51,232
What is AK-47

686
00:37:54,304 --> 00:37:56,608
Front paws still shot

687
00:37:57,120 --> 00:37:59,168
Infowars.com from the video

688
00:37:59,424 --> 00:38:00,704
Showing in window rifle

689
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:01,728
To the window of the

690
00:38:02,496 --> 00:38:03,776
When people beating on it screaming

691
00:38:05,824 --> 00:38:07,104
White person out

692
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:12,736
You can go to Infowars and I don't have any proof of this or that Alex's

693
00:38:14,016 --> 00:38:20,160
Azad Foster pointing his gun at this car

694
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:23,232
And also he image

695
00:38:23,488 --> 00:38:24,512
Clearly doesn't show that

696
00:38:25,024 --> 00:38:27,584
It shows Foster near the car with one arm back

697
00:38:29,632 --> 00:38:31,424
Very clearly appears to be pointy

698
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:32,192
Doubt

699
00:38:32,448 --> 00:38:36,800
It's difficult to explain this without the imagery but from the angle this picture was taken from

700
00:38:37,056 --> 00:38:42,432
There's literally no way that is going to be pointed at anything further up than the bottom of this car's Tire

701
00:38:42,688 --> 00:38:44,736
And the reason for that is there are things

702
00:38:44,992 --> 00:38:46,272
Behind him

703
00:38:46,528 --> 00:38:48,320
It would have been blocked by the gun

704
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:50,624
Barrel

705
00:38:51,136 --> 00:38:54,464
You can see the back of his

706
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:56,256
Which of the gun is the back

707
00:39:00,608 --> 00:39:04,448
Scene like this guy who's standing behind it blog

708
00:39:04,704 --> 00:39:08,288
Yeah have been blocked by the color of his shirt

709
00:39:08,544 --> 00:39:11,872
His arm would not you couldn't see

710
00:39:15,712 --> 00:39:16,224
Is images

711
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:17,248
Itself is ascorbate

712
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:18,784
It shows that it wasn't

713
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:19,552
Pointed at the car

714
00:39:21,856 --> 00:39:26,208
Images

715
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:30,048
It's the aftermath of this car driving directly into a group of people

716
00:39:30,816 --> 00:39:35,936
Perhaps at that point the driver felt worried about people surrounding

717
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:39,008
Accelerated

718
00:39:39,776 --> 00:39:41,824
Is a very disgraceful display Oz putting on here

719
00:39:42,336 --> 00:39:47,712
He's describing a guy who is killed

720
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:48,736
Some kind of legal action

721
00:39:49,248 --> 00:39:51,040
I know f*** that surprised

722
00:39:51,296 --> 00:39:52,064
You know

723
00:39:55,136 --> 00:39:56,928
Like it's not like

724
00:39:57,184 --> 00:39:58,976
It's not like Garrett Foster is

725
00:39:59,744 --> 00:40:00,256
Public figure

726
00:40:00,768 --> 00:40:01,280
So f*****

727
00:40:04,608 --> 00:40:05,120
Like I

728
00:40:05,376 --> 00:40:05,888
I guess

729
00:40:06,144 --> 00:40:06,912
If he is

730
00:40:07,168 --> 00:40:07,680
Come to Back

731
00:40:09,472 --> 00:40:10,752
Maybe I'd be like

732
00:40:11,264 --> 00:40:12,288
Well at least you believe

733
00:40:15,104 --> 00:40:17,152
You know like if he came out and was like

734
00:40:17,408 --> 00:40:19,712
Look this guy was a protester and I think these

735
00:40:19,968 --> 00:40:23,552
People are disgusting what they're fighting for his bulshit but the man was

736
00:40:23,808 --> 00:40:25,344
Caring open is red

737
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:28,416
He's doing everything right and got murdered

738
00:40:28,928 --> 00:40:30,720
I I guess I'd be like well

739
00:40:31,744 --> 00:40:32,256
There's some

740
00:40:33,024 --> 00:40:34,816
You know but now it's just

741
00:40:35,072 --> 00:40:37,632
It's feel so empty when the 2nd Amendment is gone

742
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:38,656
For Alex

743
00:40:38,912 --> 00:40:40,192
And me

744
00:40:40,448 --> 00:40:43,008
Yeah it's jarring yeah

745
00:40:43,264 --> 00:40:44,032
Yeah

746
00:40:44,288 --> 00:40:46,848
It's interesting to try and like fantasy book

747
00:40:47,104 --> 00:40:49,920
What would it be like if Alex Hepburn

748
00:40:50,176 --> 00:40:53,248
We would have responded to a lot of things over

749
00:40:53,504 --> 00:40:56,320
Over the course of this very differently

750
00:40:56,576 --> 00:40:57,600
Be a lot of the positions

751
00:40:58,112 --> 00:40:58,880
He's in now

752
00:40:59,136 --> 00:41:00,928
So I mean I think I think

753
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:05,792
Imagining that One Singular decision

754
00:41:06,048 --> 00:41:09,376
We'd be like

755
00:41:11,168 --> 00:41:13,728
Certainly with a much different picture of Ali

756
00:41:14,496 --> 00:41:18,848
What you clearly have

757
00:41:22,432 --> 00:41:26,528
I think obviously I would never going to see eye-to-eye with Alex on

758
00:41:30,112 --> 00:41:31,392
Social issues

759
00:41:32,672 --> 00:41:33,952
Don't ever really expect

760
00:41:35,488 --> 00:41:36,256
You stink

761
00:41:36,512 --> 00:41:38,048
Like something's Transat

762
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:39,840
And now they do

763
00:41:41,376 --> 00:41:42,400
He doesn't live in America

764
00:41:42,656 --> 00:41:43,936
He lives in fictional fascist

765
00:41:45,216 --> 00:41:49,056
Other

766
00:41:49,312 --> 00:41:50,336
Spots of unrest

767
00:41:50,592 --> 00:41:52,384
Sure

768
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:54,175
And how mayor Ted wheeler

769
00:41:54,431 --> 00:41:56,223
Went out to the protest

770
00:41:56,479 --> 00:41:57,503
A little while back

771
00:41:57,759 --> 00:41:58,527
Alex

772
00:41:58,783 --> 00:42:00,319
Perspective

773
00:42:00,575 --> 00:42:02,367
All these armchair leftist

774
00:42:06,207 --> 00:42:08,767
Went out to support

775
00:42:10,559 --> 00:42:12,351
Him cuz he's old whitener

776
00:42:14,655 --> 00:42:17,471
They don't even know he's the mayor under Soros

777
00:42:19,007 --> 00:42:22,335
Who's the mayor

778
00:42:22,847 --> 00:42:27,967
Alex is trying to turn this into something worth

779
00:42:30,015 --> 00:42:32,063
Situation analysis

780
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:32,831
Consideration

781
00:42:33,087 --> 00:42:33,599
Is the fact that

782
00:42:34,367 --> 00:42:35,135
You know that wasn't

783
00:42:35,391 --> 00:42:36,671
Just about federal agent

784
00:42:38,719 --> 00:42:39,743
And the protest

785
00:42:40,255 --> 00:42:43,583
In Portland has to do with also the Portland

786
00:42:43,839 --> 00:42:44,607
Police Bureau

787
00:42:44,863 --> 00:42:45,887
Which is under the

788
00:42:46,143 --> 00:42:46,911
The address of

789
00:42:47,167 --> 00:42:48,703
Ted wheeler

790
00:42:49,215 --> 00:42:52,543
They don't appreciate the guy who ordered the cops

791
00:42:52,799 --> 00:42:54,591
Stu mercilessly

792
00:42:54,847 --> 00:42:55,359
Terroriser

793
00:42:55,615 --> 00:43:00,223
A 45 days then showed up and tried to make it into a thing about

794
00:43:00,735 --> 00:43:02,271
Yeah it's more of a PR

795
00:43:02,527 --> 00:43:08,415
Kind of looking thing for him to show up at the the Broadway Federal

796
00:43:08,671 --> 00:43:09,951
Folks

797
00:43:10,207 --> 00:43:11,487
When there had been weeks

798
00:43:11,743 --> 00:43:12,511
Some weeks

799
00:43:14,303 --> 00:43:15,583
Stop beating people

800
00:43:18,399 --> 00:43:21,983
Actually there is much different

801
00:43:23,775 --> 00:43:24,287
This

802
00:43:24,543 --> 00:43:26,079
Pickle

803
00:43:33,247 --> 00:43:34,783
This is childish

804
00:43:35,039 --> 00:43:41,183
I don't think he would have the same take if it's the same thing that would happen if Lori Lightfoot

805
00:43:41,439 --> 00:43:44,511
Chicago's miserable terrible mayor

806
00:43:45,023 --> 00:43:46,047
Showed up at a protest

807
00:43:46,303 --> 00:43:48,351
Here and got teargas everybody be like

808
00:43:48,607 --> 00:43:52,703
We still f****** hate you you ordered the Chicago cops to do this

809
00:43:53,215 --> 00:43:59,359
So Alex gets into Colorado there's a shooting there recently and also

810
00:43:59,615 --> 00:44:01,663
About from last month

811
00:44:01,919 --> 00:44:03,199
There was another

812
00:44:04,223 --> 00:44:05,503
And so it is

813
00:44:06,271 --> 00:44:08,319
Doesn't really talk about the current

814
00:44:11,903 --> 00:44:12,415
On that one.

815
00:44:12,927 --> 00:44:14,975
Colorado another Colorado

816
00:44:15,743 --> 00:44:18,815
Oh wait there's more not just yesterday another

817
00:44:19,071 --> 00:44:20,863
Where they shoot the man

818
00:44:21,631 --> 00:44:23,935
Persian critical condition brain-dead

819
00:44:27,519 --> 00:44:28,031
Lawyer

820
00:44:28,543 --> 00:44:29,823
Didn't he get his mugshot

821
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:31,615
So proud of what he did

822
00:44:31,871 --> 00:44:33,151
He shot a Nazi

823
00:44:33,663 --> 00:44:36,479
Returning to a story we covered while back

824
00:44:36,991 --> 00:44:40,575
Alamosa Colorado

825
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:46,975
When we discussed the story my position was at the shooter was way out of line and it did not appear that this driver was

826
00:44:47,231 --> 00:44:49,535
Endangering people are threatening to hurt anyone

827
00:44:50,047 --> 00:44:54,911
I don't know any information that subsequently come out

828
00:44:55,423 --> 00:44:57,471
I remember covering this

829
00:44:57,983 --> 00:44:59,519
The video does not show

830
00:45:00,031 --> 00:45:01,055
Anything

831
00:45:01,311 --> 00:45:02,591
Even close to justifiable

832
00:45:06,175 --> 00:45:07,455
Completing casual liar

833
00:45:07,967 --> 00:45:13,087
And that clip you said the last guy who got shot was in critical condition and brain-dead

834
00:45:13,855 --> 00:45:17,183
Weirdly if you look for an update on Danny Pruitt was the shooting

835
00:45:17,439 --> 00:45:19,999
Victim

836
00:45:20,255 --> 00:45:25,887
From June 26th which says that he was discharged from hospital on that Wednesday

837
00:45:26,143 --> 00:45:28,959
He's very pleased to have been released and very excited about getting

838
00:45:29,215 --> 00:45:29,727
To see his daughter

839
00:45:30,495 --> 00:45:36,127
That's not to say that he's fully recovered by that point

840
00:45:36,383 --> 00:45:37,407
Some to recover at home

841
00:45:38,175 --> 00:45:39,455
I don't think I need to say this

842
00:45:40,991 --> 00:45:41,503
You can't

843
00:45:41,759 --> 00:45:45,087
Do that know he was really excited to see his granddaughter

844
00:45:45,343 --> 00:45:48,927
Which you could see on the EKG

845
00:45:49,439 --> 00:45:50,463
Jordans

846
00:45:50,719 --> 00:45:56,607
Supreme justice irreversible brain function

847
00:45:56,863 --> 00:45:57,375
Sweets

848
00:45:57,631 --> 00:46:02,239
People with artificial process never recover

849
00:46:02,495 --> 00:46:04,799
And you will not be able to go home and eat

850
00:46:05,055 --> 00:46:08,895
Because it makes his political targets

851
00:46:09,151 --> 00:46:09,663
Look worse

852
00:46:10,175 --> 00:46:11,967
He doesn't care at all about sexual

853
00:46:12,223 --> 00:46:13,247
Actual recording

854
00:46:13,759 --> 00:46:14,527
Is

855
00:46:15,551 --> 00:46:19,391
He's trying to make his enemies look worse by making damage

856
00:46:19,647 --> 00:46:20,159
Did they

857
00:46:20,415 --> 00:46:20,927
Done

858
00:46:21,183 --> 00:46:21,951
Seem worse

859
00:46:22,207 --> 00:46:24,767
Just shooting the guy is terrible

860
00:46:25,023 --> 00:46:29,375
I don't I don't have any interest in supporting this guy for shooting that guy

861
00:46:29,631 --> 00:46:30,655
Cannot believe

862
00:46:33,215 --> 00:46:34,239
I mean

863
00:46:34,751 --> 00:46:35,519
In a in a

864
00:46:35,775 --> 00:46:38,591
It's like when you're determined

865
00:46:38,847 --> 00:46:39,359
Sing

866
00:46:39,615 --> 00:46:40,127
You're like

867
00:46:40,639 --> 00:46:45,759
He shot him in the leg so that's not attempted murder or something I guess

868
00:46:46,015 --> 00:46:48,831
As opposed to as opposed to shooting him in the chest

869
00:46:49,343 --> 00:46:51,135
I don't know and the punishment

870
00:46:51,647 --> 00:46:55,999
Are you don't need to add anything after 6 the guy

871
00:46:56,511 --> 00:46:58,815
Miss Casey

872
00:46:59,071 --> 00:46:59,583
You know like

873
00:47:03,935 --> 00:47:05,471
You could look at it from

874
00:47:06,751 --> 00:47:07,263
Sequential

875
00:47:07,519 --> 00:47:09,055
Perspective but a lot of it is

876
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:13,919
Whatever happens after you make the decision

877
00:47:14,175 --> 00:47:15,711
You shoot somebody

878
00:47:15,967 --> 00:47:20,063
Sometimes sometimes

879
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:21,343
Or your whatever

880
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:22,879
Respect if you want to have on it

881
00:47:23,903 --> 00:47:26,207
Outside of your control

882
00:47:26,463 --> 00:47:27,487
Yeah yeah

883
00:47:28,511 --> 00:47:30,303
Thank you for coming to my TED Talk

884
00:47:32,351 --> 00:47:34,655
I think it's a simple one really important

885
00:47:36,447 --> 00:47:38,239
And that is that

886
00:47:38,495 --> 00:47:41,055
This guy in Colorado

887
00:47:41,311 --> 00:47:41,823
This driver

888
00:47:43,615 --> 00:47:45,151
Surahs

889
00:47:46,687 --> 00:47:47,199
Because

890
00:47:47,455 --> 00:47:48,735
Is he thinks he's going to get away with it

891
00:47:49,247 --> 00:47:53,087
Man who was driving

892
00:47:57,951 --> 00:48:01,791
Mugshot for capital murder

893
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:08,959
And your family

894
00:48:10,495 --> 00:48:14,847
Weather

895
00:48:15,103 --> 00:48:17,407
I guess I figured he was going to do

896
00:48:17,663 --> 00:48:19,455
Just get out 16 coming to stop rice

897
00:48:19,711 --> 00:48:20,991
So this guy was like

898
00:48:21,247 --> 00:48:24,063
Dude they stormed the Bastille

899
00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:26,623
Colorado local

900
00:48:26,879 --> 00:48:33,023
Odd situation

901
00:48:37,887 --> 00:48:39,423
Individual

902
00:48:41,215 --> 00:48:44,287
People have brought up that there is Frontline

903
00:48:44,543 --> 00:48:46,847
Report about Alex

904
00:48:47,103 --> 00:48:49,407
Be coming out as a recording at Emily

905
00:48:49,663 --> 00:48:50,943
This evening

906
00:48:51,199 --> 00:48:54,271
Chablis deal with that right

907
00:48:54,527 --> 00:48:58,111
The idea that people are going to be talking about it excited about that

908
00:49:00,927 --> 00:49:05,535
About this report I have no idea

909
00:49:05,791 --> 00:49:07,583
Guida.

910
00:49:08,863 --> 00:49:12,703
Interesting we might cover it 4 episode

911
00:49:14,751 --> 00:49:15,519
It might just be

912
00:49:15,775 --> 00:49:17,311
Are we going to do how not to

913
00:49:17,567 --> 00:49:23,711
To cover Alex Jones for whatever number we're on

914
00:49:24,991 --> 00:49:25,759
Like a cookie

915
00:49:26,015 --> 00:49:27,295
I could be a Megyn Kelly situation

916
00:49:29,599 --> 00:49:30,367
Accurate

917
00:49:31,391 --> 00:49:33,951
Time will tell

918
00:49:35,743 --> 00:49:36,255
In my mind

919
00:49:37,023 --> 00:49:39,071
Simultaneously have Frontline coming in

920
00:49:40,351 --> 00:49:42,399
The multi Siri show app

921
00:49:42,911 --> 00:49:43,935
Fiction

922
00:49:48,543 --> 00:49:50,591
They're actually going to say

923
00:49:50,847 --> 00:49:52,895
I'm told that Russians found info

924
00:49:54,687 --> 00:49:56,223
Dependable to say that

925
00:49:56,479 --> 00:49:57,503
Look at this headline

926
00:49:57,759 --> 00:49:58,271
You

927
00:49:58,527 --> 00:49:59,295
2 conspiracy

928
00:50:02,367 --> 00:50:03,391
Rodger Stone

929
00:50:08,255 --> 00:50:10,815
Helped to lay the foundation for the conspiracy theory

930
00:50:11,327 --> 00:50:12,095
Detect centerstage

931
00:50:12,607 --> 00:50:13,119
America's Best

932
00:50:13,887 --> 00:50:14,399
Conversation

933
00:50:17,215 --> 00:50:17,727
Their appointment

934
00:50:20,543 --> 00:50:21,055
It's me

935
00:50:21,567 --> 00:50:22,079
Evil

936
00:50:24,895 --> 00:50:25,407
Against

937
00:50:25,663 --> 00:50:26,431
Compulsory masks

938
00:50:27,455 --> 00:50:27,967
How horrible

939
00:50:28,991 --> 00:50:29,503
We are

940
00:50:30,015 --> 00:50:35,135
Alexandrian to be too worried or to threaten about their so that either

941
00:50:35,391 --> 00:50:39,231
He's really miss calculating or it won't be anything there

942
00:50:39,487 --> 00:50:40,255
Is 2

943
00:50:40,511 --> 00:50:41,023
Hard-hitting

944
00:50:41,535 --> 00:50:42,815
That's kind of

945
00:50:43,071 --> 00:50:43,583
He

946
00:50:43,839 --> 00:50:44,863
Freaked out

947
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:46,911
Before Megan Kelly

948
00:50:47,167 --> 00:50:48,191
And that's because

949
00:50:48,703 --> 00:50:53,823
I think he was aware that she had something on video that he was worried about being in the actual

950
00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:56,127
Cellar

951
00:50:56,383 --> 00:50:56,895
Whatever

952
00:50:57,919 --> 00:51:04,063
This is how I honestly don't believe it you know somebody who's involved Russia paid him or whatever

953
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:05,343
I don't believe that

954
00:51:06,111 --> 00:51:07,903
Whatever this is it just doesn't seem like

955
00:51:08,159 --> 00:51:09,951
This is impossible

956
00:51:10,207 --> 00:51:11,487
PR

957
00:51:11,743 --> 00:51:12,767
As opposed to something

958
00:51:13,279 --> 00:51:13,791
Threatened

959
00:51:14,303 --> 00:51:15,071
His

960
00:51:15,327 --> 00:51:16,607
Rosati's

961
00:51:18,143 --> 00:51:19,167
Probably

962
00:51:19,423 --> 00:51:19,935
Reasonably

963
00:51:21,727 --> 00:51:23,263
It's not like they're going it's not

964
00:51:23,519 --> 00:51:24,287
QBs is going to

965
00:51:24,543 --> 00:51:25,311
Take away his audio

966
00:51:25,823 --> 00:51:28,127
An audience is going to watch PBS and be like

967
00:51:28,383 --> 00:51:32,735
Oh no

968
00:51:33,247 --> 00:51:39,391
Is people who don't know anything about him or like to Alex Jones and Rodger Stone and Donald Trump

969
00:51:39,647 --> 00:51:40,415
And then maybe check in

970
00:51:40,671 --> 00:51:44,255
Says whatever he wants

971
00:51:46,303 --> 00:51:47,071
Bat viruses

972
00:51:47,327 --> 00:51:48,095
It's fun to the info

973
00:51:48,351 --> 00:51:48,863
Toss it in there

974
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:51,679
Rambling about Alexander

975
00:51:51,935 --> 00:51:52,447
Leitson

976
00:51:52,703 --> 00:51:55,007
Gulag archipelago

977
00:51:55,519 --> 00:51:56,543
And

978
00:51:57,823 --> 00:51:58,335
This is sad

979
00:51:58,591 --> 00:52:00,383
The Washington post's front-page

980
00:52:02,431 --> 00:52:04,479
Josh Wilson

981
00:52:04,735 --> 00:52:05,247
Pleasanton

982
00:52:07,807 --> 00:52:11,391
You know I think I'll just go ahead and love garden jail

983
00:52:12,159 --> 00:52:12,671
And

984
00:52:28,799 --> 00:52:29,311
Best price

985
00:52:33,151 --> 00:52:33,663
Panic

986
00:52:37,247 --> 00:52:41,599
I remind myself

987
00:52:42,623 --> 00:52:46,719
Don't know where that quote is

988
00:52:46,975 --> 00:52:48,767
Filtration

989
00:52:50,303 --> 00:52:52,351
I didn't get lunch

990
00:52:52,607 --> 00:52:53,375
Today

991
00:52:53,631 --> 00:52:54,911
Antifa guard what are you

992
00:52:55,167 --> 00:53:00,543
Ideologically opposed to you being here in the first place

993
00:53:03,615 --> 00:53:04,127
I don't know

994
00:53:04,383 --> 00:53:05,407
Anyway

995
00:53:05,663 --> 00:53:06,175
Alex

996
00:53:06,687 --> 00:53:10,783
It's like I told you the beginning of this episode about three-quarters of the way

997
00:53:11,039 --> 00:53:15,391
I lost my will to live that's largely because Alex is rationalizing

998
00:53:15,647 --> 00:53:17,951
The killing of a protester based on the fact

999
00:53:18,207 --> 00:53:18,975
He had a gun

1000
00:53:24,607 --> 00:53:27,423
Which really really hurts his second amendment position

1001
00:53:27,935 --> 00:53:28,703
And then

1002
00:53:29,983 --> 00:53:31,007
He has a guest

1003
00:53:31,519 --> 00:53:32,031
But I was just

1004
00:53:33,055 --> 00:53:34,591
Returning from New York

1005
00:53:34,847 --> 00:53:36,639
Another great family spend

1006
00:53:37,919 --> 00:53:38,431
To get me and

1007
00:53:39,711 --> 00:53:40,223
Congressman

1008
00:53:45,343 --> 00:53:46,111
And Order Riley.

1009
00:53:49,439 --> 00:53:52,255
Ourisman Law & Order rally in the history of of

1010
00:53:54,815 --> 00:53:55,839
People because

1011
00:54:04,799 --> 00:54:05,823
In a time where the mark

1012
00:54:06,079 --> 00:54:07,359
Democrat answer

1013
00:54:07,871 --> 00:54:08,383
MS-13

1014
00:54:09,151 --> 00:54:10,943
Matter oh my God

1015
00:54:11,455 --> 00:54:13,503
Destroyed the morale

1016
00:54:15,807 --> 00:54:17,599
Dog Heroes across this country

1017
00:54:18,111 --> 00:54:20,671
The Ted Nugent Saint to complain about losing

1018
00:54:20,927 --> 00:54:21,695
Oh man

1019
00:54:22,975 --> 00:54:24,767
Terrible

1020
00:54:25,023 --> 00:54:26,559
Few days ago I watched

1021
00:54:27,839 --> 00:54:29,119
He did I was trying to

1022
00:54:29,631 --> 00:54:30,655
Think of another reverse

1023
00:54:34,239 --> 00:54:34,751
With Eric

1024
00:54:35,007 --> 00:54:37,055
Worlds Collide

1025
00:54:37,311 --> 00:54:38,847
I will tell you something right now

1026
00:54:39,103 --> 00:54:44,479
Word for word you said that

1027
00:54:44,735 --> 00:54:50,367
Practice that's that black lives matter MS-13

1028
00:54:50,623 --> 00:54:51,135
Yeah

1029
00:54:51,391 --> 00:54:54,719
You lost a good Prokop

1030
00:55:03,423 --> 00:55:08,287
He still went on just as planned

1031
00:55:09,823 --> 00:55:12,895
Complaints and his invitation was no longer there

1032
00:55:13,151 --> 00:55:14,687
The organisers released

1033
00:55:14,943 --> 00:55:15,711
The statement saying

1034
00:55:15,967 --> 00:55:18,527
The purpose of this demonstration is to bring together

1035
00:55:18,783 --> 00:55:20,319
In support of the

1036
00:55:21,087 --> 00:55:24,671
Well we wholeheartedly appreciate anyone who supports the men and women in blue

1037
00:55:24,927 --> 00:55:25,439
Including this

1038
00:55:25,695 --> 00:55:30,047
Nugent the controversy over his appearance is contrary to the objectives of this demonstration

1039
00:55:31,071 --> 00:55:35,423
Who knows exactly what it was

1040
00:55:35,679 --> 00:55:37,215
Honestly

1041
00:55:37,471 --> 00:55:43,615
Could have been from the accusations

1042
00:55:44,639 --> 00:55:46,687
But

1043
00:55:46,943 --> 00:55:48,223
Have a great time to learn

1044
00:55:48,479 --> 00:55:51,295
More about why Ted Nugent

1045
00:55:52,063 --> 00:55:54,879
Discussed a lot of very clear indication

1046
00:55:55,135 --> 00:55:55,647
Instead he's a predator

1047
00:55:56,159 --> 00:55:57,183
Like a song title

1048
00:55:57,439 --> 00:55:57,951
I'm a predator

1049
00:55:58,207 --> 00:55:59,743
That one is a little bit

1050
00:56:00,767 --> 00:56:05,631
Jordans

1051
00:56:08,447 --> 00:56:09,727
How do you enter your place

1052
00:56:09,983 --> 00:56:12,799
Respond with guilty or not guilty

1053
00:56:13,055 --> 00:56:16,639
Guilty play this song I'm a predator and you think about

1054
00:56:16,895 --> 00:56:17,407
What you're going to say

1055
00:56:17,663 --> 00:56:22,783
Imagining the defense lawyer for C-Murder

1056
00:56:23,295 --> 00:56:29,439
What's your client's name

1057
00:56:29,695 --> 00:56:32,511
How do you take the seat out of my name

1058
00:56:33,535 --> 00:56:38,399
Uphill battle

1059
00:56:41,215 --> 00:56:46,847
I'd like to talk to you now Jordan about Ted Nugent

1060
00:56:47,103 --> 00:56:47,871
Great

1061
00:56:48,127 --> 00:56:49,407
Sure they're fantastic

1062
00:56:49,919 --> 00:56:51,711
What is the Elon Musk

1063
00:56:51,967 --> 00:56:54,783
Interesting article

1064
00:56:55,039 --> 00:56:55,551
290

1065
00:56:55,807 --> 00:56:56,831
From the Detroit Free Press

1066
00:56:58,111 --> 00:56:59,647
This stuff is not aged well

1067
00:57:00,415 --> 00:57:06,559
As it happens in South Africa

1068
00:57:12,191 --> 00:57:17,055
Jesus Christ any write a song called I love Rhodesian to

1069
00:57:20,895 --> 00:57:23,455
Going to affect the political structure

1070
00:57:23,967 --> 00:57:26,271
Besides

1071
00:57:33,951 --> 00:57:35,487
Whoa

1072
00:57:35,743 --> 00:57:38,047
Let me let me actually you know what let's

1073
00:57:38,303 --> 00:57:42,143
Let's get this down to the very brass tacks

1074
00:57:42,399 --> 00:57:43,167
Apartheid

1075
00:57:43,679 --> 00:57:44,191
Is

1076
00:57:44,959 --> 00:57:47,519
How far to Ted Nugent

1077
00:57:48,031 --> 00:57:49,567
But this is a situation

1078
00:57:49,823 --> 00:57:51,615
What is a black-and-white issue

1079
00:57:51,871 --> 00:57:58,015
You'll be either good or bad 10 middle grabs literally right after that

1080
00:57:58,271 --> 00:58:00,831
All men are not created equal

1081
00:58:01,087 --> 00:58:07,231
It's not there's no murky understanding he literally

1082
00:58:07,487 --> 00:58:10,303
Hold on

1083
00:58:10,559 --> 00:58:14,655
Preponderance of South Africa is a different breed of man

1084
00:58:15,167 --> 00:58:16,959
He follows that up by saying quote

1085
00:58:17,215 --> 00:58:19,263
I mean that with no disrespect

1086
00:58:23,615 --> 00:58:24,895
Dammit somebody somebody

1087
00:58:25,151 --> 00:58:25,663
God

1088
00:58:27,711 --> 00:58:30,015
They are still people of the Earth but they're different

1089
00:58:30,527 --> 00:58:32,831
They put on they put bones in their noses

1090
00:58:33,087 --> 00:58:35,903
They still walk around naked their butts with their hands

1091
00:58:36,415 --> 00:58:39,231
And what I kill an antelope for their preferences the gut

1092
00:58:39,487 --> 00:58:42,047
Tile that's what they f****** want to eat the intestine

1093
00:58:42,559 --> 00:58:43,839
These are different people

1094
00:58:44,095 --> 00:58:46,143
You give them toothpaste they f****** eat it

1095
00:58:46,399 --> 00:58:47,679
I hope they don't become civilized

1096
00:58:49,471 --> 00:58:51,519
Do you know

1097
00:58:52,031 --> 00:58:52,543
Yeah

1098
00:58:56,895 --> 00:58:57,407
Is called

1099
00:58:57,663 --> 00:58:58,943
Jap wack tour

1100
00:58:59,199 --> 00:59:01,247
Which explains Bruce Lee

1101
00:59:01,503 --> 00:59:04,575
I mean no disrespect okay no stop right there

1102
00:59:04,831 --> 00:59:06,623
Here's how you end that he says

1103
00:59:06,879 --> 00:59:07,903
He says that

1104
00:59:08,159 --> 00:59:10,207
I mean no disrespect and no follow-up

1105
00:59:10,463 --> 00:59:16,607
Whatever I do know

1106
00:59:18,399 --> 00:59:19,935
I mean no disrespect

1107
00:59:20,191 --> 00:59:21,983
I'm sure the Japanese are wonderful folks

1108
00:59:24,031 --> 00:59:26,847
Bunch of guys talked about certain way

1109
00:59:27,359 --> 00:59:32,991
I use the word a lot because I hang around a lot of enzymes

1110
00:59:33,503 --> 00:59:35,551
I like to communicate

1111
00:59:35,807 --> 00:59:38,111
I'm a fun guy not a sexist or racist

1112
00:59:40,159 --> 00:59:40,671
Man

1113
00:59:40,927 --> 00:59:44,767
Everybody who's bitching about cancel culture now

1114
00:59:45,023 --> 00:59:48,863
Back in time and see what people got away with which is this

1115
00:59:49,119 --> 00:59:55,263
In the article is Ted Nugent

1116
00:59:55,775 --> 00:59:58,591
Weirdly later

1117
00:59:58,847 --> 01:00:01,663
Is specifically a word that uses to describe killing animals

1118
01:00:03,455 --> 01:00:04,991
Hunting Buddies are known as wackers

1119
01:00:05,247 --> 01:00:06,271
Nugent of course

1120
01:00:06,527 --> 01:00:07,295
Is the whackmaster

1121
01:00:08,063 --> 01:00:08,575
Seems like

1122
01:00:08,831 --> 01:00:12,927
Jeff wack

1123
01:00:13,183 --> 01:00:13,951
I mean no

1124
01:00:14,207 --> 01:00:14,719
Respect

1125
01:00:15,743 --> 01:00:16,511
Also

1126
01:00:18,303 --> 01:00:22,143
Performative patriotism this passage about dodging the draft

1127
01:00:22,399 --> 01:00:23,167
Seems pretty ironic

1128
01:00:23,935 --> 01:00:26,239
Vietnam

1129
01:00:26,495 --> 01:00:31,103
He claims that 30 days before his draft board physically stopped all forms of personal hygiene

1130
01:00:31,615 --> 01:00:33,407
The last 10 days he ingested nothing but

1131
01:00:33,663 --> 01:00:34,943
Vienna sausages and Pepsi

1132
01:00:35,199 --> 01:00:41,343
And a week before his physical he stopped using the bathroom altogether virtually living inside his pants cake with his own exit

1133
01:00:42,111 --> 01:00:43,135
Stand by his urine

1134
01:00:43,647 --> 01:00:46,975
That spectacle one newton to deferment he says Toby

1135
01:00:47,231 --> 01:00:49,535
Free Press was unable to verify his

1136
01:00:50,559 --> 01:00:51,583
I think he's full of s***

1137
01:00:51,839 --> 01:00:54,399
But also

1138
01:00:55,167 --> 01:00:55,679
Absolutely

1139
01:00:56,703 --> 01:00:57,983
But also

1140
01:00:58,751 --> 01:00:59,263
That's a

1141
01:00:59,519 --> 01:01:01,311
Pretty novel way to dodge the draft

1142
01:01:01,567 --> 01:01:02,335
I think it's awful

1143
01:01:04,127 --> 01:01:07,455
I think it's okay to not want to go to war

1144
01:01:07,967 --> 01:01:10,271
My life

1145
01:01:10,527 --> 01:01:11,551
I would not submit myself to

1146
01:01:11,807 --> 01:01:15,135
Also wouldn't try to subvert the process

1147
01:01:15,903 --> 01:01:19,743
Countless conscientious objectors Hoover ethical or religious reasons

1148
01:01:19,999 --> 01:01:22,047
Refuse to participate in any kind of War

1149
01:01:22,303 --> 01:01:23,839
And sometimes they pay penalty for it

1150
01:01:24,095 --> 01:01:29,215
Part of their political statement cowardly dick

1151
01:01:29,471 --> 01:01:32,287
Any idea if you can look back on this and brag about it as an adult

1152
01:01:32,543 --> 01:01:34,847
Does pretty sad don't forget he is a cowardly dick

1153
01:01:35,103 --> 01:01:36,383
Covered in his own s***

1154
01:01:41,503 --> 01:01:42,783
Apartments

1155
01:01:43,039 --> 01:01:45,087
Okay alright

1156
01:01:46,111 --> 01:01:48,415
Sex predator

1157
01:01:50,207 --> 01:01:50,719
Racist

1158
01:01:51,231 --> 01:01:54,815
Misogynistic on top of being

1159
01:01:57,631 --> 01:01:58,911
Property in South Africa

1160
01:01:59,679 --> 01:02:01,727
Gets to become famous

1161
01:02:02,495 --> 01:02:03,007
Rich

1162
01:02:03,263 --> 01:02:06,079
And spend the rest of his life in the public eye

1163
01:02:06,591 --> 01:02:09,151
Because he rode a cuz he's a one hit wonder

1164
01:02:10,431 --> 01:02:12,223
That seems unfair

1165
01:02:12,479 --> 01:02:15,807
Basketball should be still around if we're measuring by this

1166
01:02:16,831 --> 01:02:20,671
The races

1167
01:02:20,927 --> 01:02:22,975
Predatory monster who is a brain of a weapon

1168
01:02:23,231 --> 01:02:23,999
The best child

1169
01:02:24,255 --> 01:02:28,863
And hasn't even ever had an album or single reach the top 10 on the chart

1170
01:02:29,119 --> 01:02:30,655
Never had a number one single

1171
01:02:30,911 --> 01:02:36,031
Which reached number 13 40 years ago

1172
01:02:36,543 --> 01:02:40,895
Either worthless sack of s*** who's not even relevant to his primary occupation which is music

1173
01:02:41,407 --> 01:02:43,711
Yeah it makes sense that people wouldn't want

1174
01:02:43,967 --> 01:02:46,015
Regardless of the event character

1175
01:02:46,271 --> 01:02:47,807
He makes your event look bad

1176
01:02:48,319 --> 01:02:50,623
Because if he's there it implies that you paid him to be there

1177
01:02:51,135 --> 01:02:52,159
If you paid to be there

1178
01:02:52,415 --> 01:02:52,927
You're an a******

1179
01:02:53,695 --> 01:02:57,023
Ynes Ted coming on Infowars to complain about losing

1180
01:02:57,279 --> 01:03:00,607
Gig because it is long and very overt piece of s***

1181
01:03:01,119 --> 01:03:05,983
Toxic the even a Prokop rally at some reservations about being associated with

1182
01:03:06,239 --> 01:03:08,799
What a bunch of babies

1183
01:03:09,311 --> 01:03:11,359
I'll tether back

1184
01:03:11,615 --> 01:03:14,943
Ted wheeler

1185
01:03:15,199 --> 01:03:21,343
3343

1186
01:03:21,599 --> 01:03:24,415
Better Off Ted was pretty good job.

1187
01:03:24,671 --> 01:03:25,951
Yeah

1188
01:03:26,975 --> 01:03:28,511
Is the Arabic that's the one

1189
01:03:28,767 --> 01:03:29,535
Was Martin Short

1190
01:03:30,815 --> 01:03:31,583
No that was how clever

1191
01:03:32,863 --> 01:03:34,143
So it wasn't

1192
01:03:34,399 --> 01:03:35,935
The Prokop

1193
01:03:36,191 --> 01:03:36,959
Rally

1194
01:03:38,495 --> 01:03:39,007
Reject

1195
01:03:40,031 --> 01:03:40,543
Per se

1196
01:03:40,799 --> 01:03:41,823
Also they

1197
01:03:42,079 --> 01:03:44,127
And the organizers were seemed alright with

1198
01:03:44,383 --> 01:03:45,407
That once he wasn't coming

1199
01:03:46,175 --> 01:03:49,247
The issue came down to something else and that is

1200
01:03:49,503 --> 01:03:50,015
Ted Nugent

1201
01:03:50,271 --> 01:03:50,783
Got threatened

1202
01:03:51,295 --> 01:03:51,807
By Andrew Cuomo

1203
01:03:57,183 --> 01:03:57,695
Governor

1204
01:03:58,975 --> 01:03:59,487
And his

1205
01:04:05,119 --> 01:04:06,399
In New York

1206
01:04:06,655 --> 01:04:08,191
Play the national anthem

1207
01:04:14,335 --> 01:04:15,359
New York area

1208
01:04:19,199 --> 01:04:20,735
Cancel 14 days

1209
01:04:27,391 --> 01:04:28,671
The nypd's

1210
01:04:32,511 --> 01:04:35,327
I'm pretty sure that Andrew Cuomo didn't personally threatened Ted

1211
01:04:36,351 --> 01:04:41,727
Is this Long Island press they say County Executive

1212
01:04:43,007 --> 01:04:44,031
Your reason for his abs

1213
01:04:44,543 --> 01:04:50,687
Had Isaac because he was reminded of New York state counties protest Pro

1214
01:04:50,943 --> 01:04:51,455
4 calls

1215
01:04:51,711 --> 01:04:53,247
New York from over 30

1216
01:04:53,503 --> 01:04:59,647
States with significant Community coronavirus spread a required to quarantine for 14 days for Governor Cuomo's executive order

1217
01:05:00,159 --> 01:05:01,951
Are specific to Hammett

1218
01:05:04,511 --> 01:05:07,327
Is a convenient way for everyone involved to save face

1219
01:05:10,143 --> 01:05:13,983
Texas which is an at-risk covers their base

1220
01:05:14,495 --> 01:05:18,847
The city council and problem

1221
01:05:19,359 --> 01:05:24,735
The rally organisers look real bad if they attended the rally

1222
01:05:25,503 --> 01:05:26,783
Dad probably would have liked

1223
01:05:27,039 --> 01:05:30,623
To go but this is just as good

1224
01:05:30,879 --> 01:05:32,415
Personally

1225
01:05:33,439 --> 01:05:37,791
Everybody gets what they need of the situation

1226
01:05:38,303 --> 01:05:39,839
When there is a big issue that needs

1227
01:05:40,095 --> 01:05:40,607
To be addressed here

1228
01:05:40,863 --> 01:05:43,935
Ted Nugent has no place in adult Society

1229
01:05:44,447 --> 01:05:48,799
If you wants to live out his days being a racist creep shooting arrows available privately

1230
01:05:49,055 --> 01:05:50,335
I can't stop him from that

1231
01:05:50,591 --> 01:05:54,687
Worth having in the public sphere

1232
01:05:55,455 --> 01:05:58,271
His music career is embarrassing compared to his contemporaries

1233
01:05:58,527 --> 01:05:59,039
It is exist

1234
01:05:59,295 --> 01:06:03,135
Political figure is basically just in Gallagher Dobama needs to suck his rifle

1235
01:06:06,207 --> 01:06:07,999
A loser Infowars guest

1236
01:06:08,767 --> 01:06:10,047
If some of that is booking him

1237
01:06:10,303 --> 01:06:12,863
It's not because he's a draw or because he's good at guitar

1238
01:06:13,119 --> 01:06:14,143
It's a political statement

1239
01:06:14,655 --> 01:06:16,191
They're supporting his brand of racist

1240
01:06:16,447 --> 01:06:20,543
Extremist politics anytime

1241
01:06:20,799 --> 01:06:21,311
Protest

1242
01:06:21,823 --> 01:06:23,615
You shouldn't be welcome as a public figure

1243
01:06:23,871 --> 01:06:24,639
.

1244
01:06:27,711 --> 01:06:32,575
You should be treated as such like anytime someone has him on

1245
01:06:33,087 --> 01:06:34,367
It's not because

1246
01:06:34,623 --> 01:06:35,903
Wango Tango Rock

1247
01:06:39,743 --> 01:06:40,511
He's doing a concert

1248
01:06:40,767 --> 01:06:41,535
Or something

1249
01:06:42,303 --> 01:06:44,095
Maybe that's not a political statement for like

1250
01:06:45,631 --> 01:06:46,399
Peter to book him

1251
01:06:46,655 --> 01:06:47,679
On his tour or whatever

1252
01:06:48,191 --> 01:06:50,239
You know whatever it is what it is

1253
01:06:50,495 --> 01:06:54,335
National anthem

1254
01:06:55,103 --> 01:06:56,127
That's that's

1255
01:06:56,383 --> 01:06:58,431
I think I completely disagree

1256
01:07:02,527 --> 01:07:05,343
And they were a racist

1257
01:07:05,855 --> 01:07:06,623
Piece of s***

1258
01:07:06,879 --> 01:07:07,391
Predator

1259
01:07:09,695 --> 01:07:10,463
Club

1260
01:07:11,231 --> 01:07:12,511
You're making a political

1261
01:07:12,767 --> 01:07:13,791
Statement which is better

1262
01:07:15,327 --> 01:07:17,119
Be a racist

1263
01:07:17,375 --> 01:07:23,519
You maybe one of you maybe right now

1264
01:07:26,591 --> 01:07:28,639
The music business

1265
01:07:29,151 --> 01:07:31,967
How that works maybe it is more of a

1266
01:07:34,015 --> 01:07:40,159
He should just be you

1267
01:07:41,439 --> 01:07:45,535
Should remind him of a handgun

1268
01:07:49,887 --> 01:07:52,191
You're whining loser who doesn't believe in your own bulshit

1269
01:07:52,447 --> 01:07:53,215
Shut the fuk up

1270
01:07:53,471 --> 01:07:53,983
Stop and go away

1271
01:07:55,775 --> 01:08:01,663
Stop it

1272
01:08:01,919 --> 01:08:06,527
The real victim course

1273
01:08:07,551 --> 01:08:11,903
When I got out my bow and arrow on my fishing rod and I spent a wonderful couple days

1274
01:08:12,415 --> 01:08:13,183
My dogs are my

1275
01:08:17,023 --> 01:08:19,327
Mnuchin at all I mean

1276
01:08:20,095 --> 01:08:21,119
Possibly do to me

1277
01:08:21,375 --> 01:08:21,887
I'll tell you what

1278
01:08:27,519 --> 01:08:30,591
All of the New York Police Department Heroes

1279
01:08:31,103 --> 01:08:31,615
Bender family

1280
01:08:32,127 --> 01:08:35,199
Open the left wants to

1281
01:08:38,015 --> 01:08:38,783
Take them over

1282
01:08:39,039 --> 01:08:45,183
Lisa Morrell

1283
01:08:45,439 --> 01:08:47,231
Praise I'm looking for his delusions

1284
01:08:47,487 --> 01:08:49,535
The Grandeur I think that's the one I'm looking for

1285
01:08:50,047 --> 01:08:50,559
I think it's

1286
01:08:50,815 --> 01:08:56,959
Partially there and I think it's partially also just like this is a way I can accept about this

1287
01:08:57,471 --> 01:08:58,751
What I need to get

1288
01:08:59,007 --> 01:09:04,127
I didn't get a check

1289
01:09:04,383 --> 01:09:06,431
People didn't get to enjoy

1290
01:09:06,687 --> 01:09:09,503
My sweet lips you know who's the real victim here at the end

1291
01:09:09,759 --> 01:09:11,295
The day once again

1292
01:09:12,063 --> 01:09:15,391
What is he doing

1293
01:09:15,647 --> 01:09:17,439
From 1995 I mean

1294
01:09:17,951 --> 01:09:18,719
F*** them

1295
01:09:18,975 --> 01:09:25,119
I can't find any articles that are like Ted Nugent profusely apologizes

1296
01:09:28,447 --> 01:09:30,495
It's not a cut-and-dry issue

1297
01:09:30,751 --> 01:09:33,055
Didn't have a personal

1298
01:09:33,311 --> 01:09:34,847
Evolution on the subject

1299
01:09:35,103 --> 01:09:35,615
Very much

1300
01:09:36,127 --> 01:09:36,639
Not good

1301
01:09:39,711 --> 01:09:41,759
Expressing his belief that

1302
01:09:42,015 --> 01:09:43,551
Different groups are all really just

1303
01:09:43,807 --> 01:09:44,319
The same thing

1304
01:09:48,159 --> 01:09:49,951
MS-13

1305
01:09:56,863 --> 01:10:03,007
Sunday

1306
01:10:03,263 --> 01:10:03,775
These groups of the Sun

1307
01:10:04,543 --> 01:10:05,055
Cool

1308
01:10:06,079 --> 01:10:07,871
Very dumb very stupid child

1309
01:10:10,431 --> 01:10:11,711
Seriously no

1310
01:10:11,967 --> 01:10:12,735
Capacity

1311
01:10:13,247 --> 01:10:17,087
So are you

1312
01:10:17,343 --> 01:10:18,623
Earth Defense Force

1313
01:10:20,159 --> 01:10:20,671
That be great

1314
01:10:21,183 --> 01:10:23,231
Hunt the vote hunt the vote

1315
01:10:23,487 --> 01:10:24,255
Which sound

1316
01:10:24,511 --> 01:10:27,327
F****** scary

1317
01:10:27,583 --> 01:10:32,447
And now here we are sounds like he's going to go to Inner City Precinct

1318
01:10:32,703 --> 01:10:33,983
Centers with a bow

1319
01:10:34,495 --> 01:10:37,567
It sounds like when you say hunt Motel

1320
01:10:38,079 --> 01:10:41,407
It doesn't sound like the same as rock

1321
01:10:42,175 --> 01:10:42,943
Calmly

1322
01:10:43,711 --> 01:10:44,991
Individual voters

1323
01:10:46,271 --> 01:10:47,295
Get them in his sight

1324
01:10:47,807 --> 01:10:48,319
And then

1325
01:10:48,575 --> 01:10:49,855
Convince them to vote for

1326
01:10:50,623 --> 01:10:51,903
Well I mean

1327
01:10:52,159 --> 01:10:55,487
He's very good that I find is like

1328
01:10:55,743 --> 01:10:57,535
You know

1329
01:10:58,047 --> 01:10:59,071
The object of hunt

1330
01:10:59,327 --> 01:11:00,607
What is the thing that is killed

1331
01:11:05,471 --> 01:11:06,495
But you're making it better

1332
01:11:07,007 --> 01:11:13,151
Rocking the videos

1333
01:11:19,039 --> 01:11:22,623
I'm going to

1334
01:11:22,879 --> 01:11:23,647
The most dangerous

1335
01:11:24,671 --> 01:11:28,511
I think it's

1336
01:11:29,791 --> 01:11:30,815
Hawkins be working how's it going

1337
01:11:33,375 --> 01:11:34,655
A trap

1338
01:11:34,911 --> 01:11:39,007
Obviously a data-gathering operation

1339
01:11:39,263 --> 01:11:43,103
People to put in their personal information as

1340
01:11:43,359 --> 01:11:47,711
I meant pledge to vote contact

1341
01:11:57,695 --> 01:11:58,463
10%

1342
01:11:58,719 --> 01:12:01,535
Or something when I checked tonight

1343
01:12:03,071 --> 01:12:03,839
Looking for

1344
01:12:06,655 --> 01:12:07,423
These people need

1345
01:12:07,679 --> 01:12:08,447
Stop

1346
01:12:08,703 --> 01:12:09,727
Referring to history

1347
01:12:10,239 --> 01:12:11,263
Not good

1348
01:12:11,519 --> 01:12:13,055
Pictures lie simple

1349
01:12:15,359 --> 01:12:18,175
Or just register

1350
01:12:20,479 --> 01:12:20,991
Alamo

1351
01:12:21,503 --> 01:12:24,831
We need to shoot Santa Anna's man

1352
01:12:29,951 --> 01:12:30,719
Laundromat

1353
01:12:30,975 --> 01:12:31,743
You think you're so hot

1354
01:12:31,999 --> 01:12:32,767
You lost

1355
01:12:33,023 --> 01:12:33,535
The Alamo

1356
01:12:34,047 --> 01:12:34,815
The Alamo

1357
01:12:37,887 --> 01:12:39,423
Haunted by the Mexican Army

1358
01:12:40,191 --> 01:12:40,959
I don't know

1359
01:12:42,751 --> 01:12:48,895
You got to stop being like this is the Alamo because you're just saying we're going to lose

1360
01:12:49,151 --> 01:12:54,783
He's doing losses do we should have been there in the first place

1361
01:12:55,039 --> 01:12:57,343
Poorly managed this situation

1362
01:12:57,855 --> 01:13:01,439
Absolute idiot Colonel Travis is a drunk

1363
01:13:01,951 --> 01:13:03,743
Really Step Up

1364
01:13:04,255 --> 01:13:06,047
This is a good metaphor for us

1365
01:13:06,559 --> 01:13:07,071
Oh boy

1366
01:13:07,327 --> 01:13:10,655
Yeah I feel like I could do better

1367
01:13:10,911 --> 01:13:11,423
It's more apps

1368
01:13:11,679 --> 01:13:12,191
Then you would expect

1369
01:13:14,751 --> 01:13:15,519
Talking about

1370
01:13:15,775 --> 01:13:17,311
The save the world

1371
01:13:17,567 --> 01:13:18,591
Some things that are happening

1372
01:13:18,847 --> 01:13:19,871
Around the country

1373
01:13:20,383 --> 01:13:21,663
I just felt like

1374
01:13:25,247 --> 01:13:26,527
67

1375
01:13:27,295 --> 01:13:29,343
With all my

1376
01:13:29,599 --> 01:13:30,367
He's talking about

1377
01:13:30,623 --> 01:13:35,231
Detroit yeah

1378
01:13:35,487 --> 01:13:35,999
Together

1379
01:13:38,559 --> 01:13:39,327
City of color

1380
01:13:39,583 --> 01:13:40,863
Read Walk of Life

1381
01:13:41,887 --> 01:13:43,423
Do you have black friends

1382
01:13:45,727 --> 01:13:47,519
Went berserk

1383
01:13:48,543 --> 01:13:51,871
Their own City this beautiful architecture so I have a good perspective

1384
01:13:52,895 --> 01:13:53,407
Junior

1385
01:13:56,991 --> 01:13:57,503
Detroit

1386
01:13:58,271 --> 01:13:59,807
Terrier

1387
01:14:10,303 --> 01:14:13,631
Suicide

1388
01:14:17,727 --> 01:14:18,239
Today

1389
01:14:23,359 --> 01:14:24,639
Evil

1390
01:14:26,431 --> 01:14:27,711
Is absurd

1391
01:14:28,223 --> 01:14:29,503
You have

1392
01:14:31,295 --> 01:14:35,903
Very committed to not recognizing what came before those

1393
01:14:36,415 --> 01:14:38,719
Not interested in discussing

1394
01:14:38,975 --> 01:14:43,583
67n randomly for no reason at all

1395
01:14:44,095 --> 01:14:47,935
Detroit

1396
01:14:48,191 --> 01:14:52,543
What happened in the lead-up to the LA riots

1397
01:14:52,799 --> 01:14:54,335
Now what

1398
01:14:54,591 --> 01:14:57,663
Is the larger conversation that these flashpoints exist with it

1399
01:14:57,919 --> 01:15:01,247
Or are you just

1400
01:15:01,503 --> 01:15:03,807
Wanting to look at this from an optic

1401
01:15:04,063 --> 01:15:07,135
Perspective

1402
01:15:07,647 --> 01:15:08,671
Honestly know what are you

1403
01:15:08,927 --> 01:15:10,975
What are you saying is like

1404
01:15:12,255 --> 01:15:14,047
Every now and again black people act

1405
01:15:14,303 --> 01:15:19,423
Crazy and I don't know why that is a presentation

1406
01:15:19,935 --> 01:15:20,447
The wow

1407
01:15:20,959 --> 01:15:21,727
Woo

1408
01:15:22,239 --> 01:15:22,751
So

1409
01:15:24,799 --> 01:15:27,871
If you had any principles and believe that anything that

1410
01:15:28,127 --> 01:15:29,151
He

1411
01:15:30,687 --> 01:15:32,735
You should be pressing down Alex about

1412
01:15:34,015 --> 01:15:36,319
Earlier in the show about a guy

1413
01:15:36,575 --> 01:15:39,135
Somehow making it like oh well. You get shot

1414
01:15:39,647 --> 01:15:40,159
Yeah

1415
01:15:40,671 --> 01:15:41,439
But it turns out

1416
01:15:42,207 --> 01:15:42,975
Ted Nugent

1417
01:15:43,231 --> 01:15:43,999
Also

1418
01:15:44,511 --> 01:15:46,559
Seems I have a weapon

1419
01:15:47,071 --> 01:15:48,607
You're no longer a protest

1420
01:15:49,375 --> 01:15:50,143
They called them

1421
01:15:54,239 --> 01:15:55,519
Building

1422
01:15:55,775 --> 01:15:57,055
Cocktails

1423
01:15:57,311 --> 01:15:59,359
Retired cops

1424
01:16:04,223 --> 01:16:04,735
Well I mean

1425
01:16:04,991 --> 01:16:07,295
St.Louis

1426
01:16:07,551 --> 01:16:12,159
We have a conversation about how that wasn't murder and I wasn't necessarily protesters

1427
01:16:12,671 --> 01:16:15,999
Is larger

1428
01:16:16,255 --> 01:16:19,327
He says there are few have weapons you're not a peaceful protest

1429
01:16:19,839 --> 01:16:22,399
Bad news but every second amendment protest

1430
01:16:22,911 --> 01:16:29,055
That is heifer happen for us to kill them because they are

1431
01:16:29,311 --> 01:16:29,823
Around with gun

1432
01:16:31,103 --> 01:16:32,639
That it's fine if we did

1433
01:16:32,895 --> 01:16:38,015
No I mean he's articulating a point very poorly because he doesn't recognize what the implication

1434
01:16:38,271 --> 01:16:39,551
Gonzaga statements are

1435
01:16:40,063 --> 01:16:43,903
You didn't recognize that condemning these protestors were having a weapon

1436
01:16:46,975 --> 01:16:48,767
Opens up the criticism

1437
01:16:49,023 --> 01:16:51,071
To everything that he supports

1438
01:16:51,327 --> 01:16:55,935
Yeah no you just doesn't recognize it cuz it doesn't matter to him doesn't give it a principle

1439
01:16:56,191 --> 01:16:57,983
It is a weapon

1440
01:16:58,239 --> 01:16:59,263
He can use against

1441
01:16:59,519 --> 01:17:00,287
It's the people he doesn't

1442
01:17:01,567 --> 01:17:02,591
What is all like

1443
01:17:04,639 --> 01:17:06,431
He doesn't care about the Second Amendment

1444
01:17:06,687 --> 01:17:08,223
Disgusting

1445
01:17:08,479 --> 01:17:09,503
That is

1446
01:17:09,759 --> 01:17:10,271
God

1447
01:17:10,527 --> 01:17:14,367
If we lived in a reasonable world every time he went on a show they were just

1448
01:17:14,623 --> 01:17:17,439
Play that clip and be like so you don't believe in the 2nd Amendment at all

1449
01:17:17,951 --> 01:17:18,719
He be like

1450
01:17:18,975 --> 01:17:21,279
And then the Chickamauga

1451
01:17:21,535 --> 01:17:22,303
That's it

1452
01:17:22,559 --> 01:17:24,095
If you if you're even nothing

1453
01:17:24,351 --> 01:17:27,167
Your threshold for like what is or is not a piece

1454
01:17:27,423 --> 01:17:28,959
Peaceful protest

1455
01:17:30,495 --> 01:17:33,311
We could take the damaging property stuff and

1456
01:17:33,567 --> 01:17:34,847
Discuss whether or not that violent

1457
01:17:35,871 --> 01:17:39,199
Conversation with Ted Nugent the conversation

1458
01:17:44,575 --> 01:17:45,599
Damage to property

1459
01:17:45,855 --> 01:17:46,623
Inherently violent

1460
01:17:47,647 --> 01:17:49,183
Be that as it may leaving that aside

1461
01:17:50,207 --> 01:17:53,279
His threshold seems to be that if you have a weapon you're not a piece

1462
01:17:53,535 --> 01:17:54,047
Protester

1463
01:17:54,559 --> 01:17:55,071
And

1464
01:17:55,327 --> 01:17:56,351
I would I would

1465
01:17:56,607 --> 01:18:00,447
Challenge him on that

1466
01:18:00,703 --> 01:18:01,983
And again

1467
01:18:02,239 --> 01:18:03,263
Is a nice days

1468
01:18:03,775 --> 01:18:09,919
God dammit

1469
01:18:12,223 --> 01:18:17,343
An amendment or is he going to go along like a coward with Alex Jones and

1470
01:18:17,599 --> 01:18:18,111
Noted

1471
01:18:18,367 --> 01:18:20,927
Predator racist monster

1472
01:18:21,439 --> 01:18:23,999
Noted Predator races monster Alex Jones

1473
01:18:27,327 --> 01:18:28,095
We will see

1474
01:18:28,351 --> 01:18:29,119
If you get the

1475
01:18:29,375 --> 01:18:29,887
Guts

1476
01:18:30,399 --> 01:18:30,911
Coward

1477
01:18:37,823 --> 01:18:39,359
Aleve

1478
01:18:41,919 --> 01:18:44,223
Interested

1479
01:18:44,991 --> 01:18:45,759
I don't know

1480
01:18:48,063 --> 01:18:49,855
Steam whenever one of these like

1481
01:18:50,111 --> 01:18:50,879
Seemingly

1482
01:18:51,135 --> 01:18:52,671
Pillars

1483
01:18:53,183 --> 01:18:53,695
Keystone

1484
01:18:53,951 --> 01:18:54,975
Seem to fall

1485
01:18:58,303 --> 01:19:01,375
Yeah it's it's totally I feel like

1486
01:19:02,143 --> 01:19:03,679
Apparent like I'm not mad at

1487
01:19:03,935 --> 01:19:04,703
You disappoint

1488
01:19:05,215 --> 01:19:07,519
I sailed on a level that I can

1489
01:19:07,775 --> 01:19:08,287
Cannot even

1490
01:19:09,823 --> 01:19:10,591
You had no reason

1491
01:19:10,847 --> 01:19:12,895
You could have just not talked about

1492
01:19:13,151 --> 01:19:19,295
You cannot talk about it or you can talk about it in a more robust way

1493
01:19:19,551 --> 01:19:21,599
It's where you can protect your gun position

1494
01:19:21,855 --> 01:19:22,623
The same time

1495
01:19:22,879 --> 01:19:23,391
Protest

1496
01:19:23,647 --> 01:19:25,183
If you so need to write

1497
01:19:25,439 --> 01:19:25,951
You don't

1498
01:19:26,463 --> 01:19:27,743
Tacoma if you're Alex

1499
01:19:27,999 --> 01:19:29,535
From the position of

1500
01:19:29,791 --> 01:19:33,631
This guy had a gun that justifies him being shot

1501
01:19:33,887 --> 01:19:37,215
You don't need to it is your principal is

1502
01:19:37,727 --> 01:19:40,031
Absolutist

1503
01:19:40,287 --> 01:19:41,055
Seems dumb

1504
01:19:41,311 --> 01:19:42,847
Yeah seems like

1505
01:19:44,639 --> 01:19:46,175
It denotes to me

1506
01:19:52,575 --> 01:19:53,087
Solidarity

1507
01:19:53,343 --> 01:19:53,855
No

1508
01:19:57,695 --> 01:19:58,719
Yeah that's

1509
01:20:04,351 --> 01:20:05,119
These arguments

1510
01:20:05,375 --> 01:20:05,887
Steady has

1511
01:20:06,143 --> 01:20:06,911
Are all

1512
01:20:07,167 --> 01:20:09,215
Just branches with no trunk Gap

1513
01:20:11,519 --> 01:20:12,543
Is a bummer

1514
01:20:13,567 --> 01:20:14,592
In a certain sense

1515
01:20:15,104 --> 01:20:18,944
I kind of so my my armchair bulshit on this

1516
01:20:19,456 --> 01:20:20,480
Is part of me

1517
01:20:21,248 --> 01:20:21,760
That

1518
01:20:22,784 --> 01:20:24,320
Because they lived through Obama

1519
01:20:25,088 --> 01:20:26,112
And they're so race

1520
01:20:26,880 --> 01:20:27,904
And they weren't allowed to

1521
01:20:28,160 --> 01:20:29,440
Did you say we hate him because he's

1522
01:20:30,464 --> 01:20:31,488
And we don't like

1523
01:20:32,512 --> 01:20:34,816
They made every argument in bad faith

1524
01:20:35,584 --> 01:20:37,632
Every argument they made was in bad faith

1525
01:20:42,240 --> 01:20:42,752
You know

1526
01:20:43,008 --> 01:20:48,384
They don't have anything that they believed in because what they believed in during Obama's years was just

1527
01:20:48,896 --> 01:20:50,432
We don't like him cuz he's black

1528
01:20:50,688 --> 01:20:52,480
Not allowing us to stay

1529
01:20:52,736 --> 01:20:55,040
So we have to make up some b******* about

1530
01:20:55,296 --> 01:20:56,064
Grabagun

1531
01:20:56,320 --> 01:20:57,344
That's a bad faith are

1532
01:20:57,856 --> 01:20:59,904
So now when we're in this situation

1533
01:21:00,160 --> 01:21:04,000
I don't even know if he probably doesn't believe that if you were

1534
01:21:04,512 --> 01:21:08,096
Maybe he does maybe he doesn't but if you were to sit him down and just really get to the

1535
01:21:08,864 --> 01:21:09,632
In private

1536
01:21:09,888 --> 01:21:10,912
It's like

1537
01:21:11,936 --> 01:21:13,984
You know you're making a bad faith argument

1538
01:21:14,240 --> 01:21:14,752
To these

1539
01:21:15,520 --> 01:21:17,312
In order to justify the violence

1540
01:21:17,568 --> 01:21:19,104
What you want you know

1541
01:21:19,360 --> 01:21:23,456
Yeah I can see where you're coming from but I disagree

1542
01:21:23,712 --> 01:21:26,016
Maybe people got accustomed

1543
01:21:26,272 --> 01:21:28,832
To this kind of behavior

1544
01:21:29,088 --> 01:21:31,904
What the stuff you were talking about

1545
01:21:32,160 --> 01:21:35,232
Predate Obama

1546
01:21:35,488 --> 01:21:37,280
It's not like they have some kind of

1547
01:21:37,536 --> 01:21:38,560
Did interest in

1548
01:21:40,096 --> 01:21:41,632
Racism behind gun-grabbing

1549
01:21:44,448 --> 01:21:46,496
The ideas

1550
01:21:47,776 --> 01:21:48,288
Clinton

1551
01:21:48,544 --> 01:21:49,568
Azure

1552
01:21:49,824 --> 01:21:53,664
Storm documentaries

1553
01:21:55,456 --> 01:21:56,480
Existed

1554
01:21:56,736 --> 01:21:58,272
Right

1555
01:21:59,808 --> 01:22:01,088
If you want if you want to like

1556
01:22:01,600 --> 01:22:02,112
Dig

1557
01:22:02,880 --> 01:22:03,648
Incredibly deep

1558
01:22:04,160 --> 01:22:04,928
Into

1559
01:22:05,440 --> 01:22:06,976
The fertile soil of

1560
01:22:07,744 --> 01:22:08,256
Then

1561
01:22:08,768 --> 01:22:09,280
Anti-communist

1562
01:22:09,792 --> 01:22:10,560
Sure

1563
01:22:10,816 --> 01:22:11,584
DD

1564
01:22:12,096 --> 01:22:14,656
Terrifying Crossroads of anti-communism

1565
01:22:15,936 --> 01:22:16,448
Anti

1566
01:22:16,704 --> 01:22:18,752
Culturalism

1567
01:22:21,056 --> 01:22:22,336
Corporate interest

1568
01:22:22,592 --> 01:22:26,176
Did the did intersect I think you could probably make

1569
01:22:26,432 --> 01:22:27,456
Incase

1570
01:22:27,968 --> 01:22:30,272
That a lot of these arguments

1571
01:22:32,064 --> 01:22:33,088
2

1572
01:22:33,344 --> 01:22:33,856
Older time

1573
01:22:34,368 --> 01:22:35,392
Do you have a racist

1574
01:22:35,904 --> 01:22:40,768
Element to 100% to make up for

1575
01:22:41,024 --> 01:22:43,584
Arguments about Obama

1576
01:22:43,840 --> 01:22:45,632
I don't think that works

1577
01:22:45,888 --> 01:22:48,448
More like they just don't even know how to have

1578
01:22:48,704 --> 01:22:49,472
An honest

1579
01:22:49,728 --> 01:22:50,240
Discussion

1580
01:22:50,752 --> 01:22:51,776
Like they genuinely just

1581
01:22:52,032 --> 01:22:53,568
Can't do it everything is filter

1582
01:22:53,824 --> 01:22:55,616
Through this prism of

1583
01:22:56,128 --> 01:22:56,896
You know possibly

1584
01:23:00,480 --> 01:23:02,272
Did there's also a possibility

1585
01:23:02,528 --> 01:23:03,040
That

1586
01:23:03,808 --> 01:23:04,832
They don't see a point

1587
01:23:05,088 --> 01:23:05,600
And having

1588
01:23:05,856 --> 01:23:07,904
You're probably 100

1589
01:23:09,440 --> 01:23:10,976
There is a utility and

1590
01:23:11,232 --> 01:23:11,744
Clearly

1591
01:23:12,512 --> 01:23:13,024
It works

1592
01:23:13,536 --> 01:23:14,048
Yeah

1593
01:23:14,304 --> 01:23:17,632
To bulshit

1594
01:23:17,888 --> 01:23:22,240
Like

1595
01:23:22,496 --> 01:23:24,544
No on a fundamental level

1596
01:23:25,056 --> 01:23:26,848
Somewhere closer

1597
01:23:27,104 --> 01:23:30,688
The truth and I can imagine

1598
01:23:30,944 --> 01:23:31,968
I'm saying

1599
01:23:32,224 --> 01:23:33,248
There are other options

1600
01:23:33,504 --> 01:23:35,296
No totally

1601
01:23:35,552 --> 01:23:36,832
Bi-Rite

1602
01:23:37,088 --> 01:23:37,856
An entirely

1603
01:23:38,368 --> 01:23:39,136
Like Mike

1604
01:23:39,904 --> 01:23:40,672
It's a red herring

1605
01:23:46,048 --> 01:23:49,120
Conversation about

1606
01:23:49,376 --> 01:23:50,400
Anything real

1607
01:23:50,656 --> 01:23:51,168
Possible

1608
01:23:51,680 --> 01:23:54,240
Also

1609
01:23:59,104 --> 01:23:59,616
Well

1610
01:24:00,128 --> 01:24:00,640
I don't know what the

1611
01:24:05,248 --> 01:24:09,856
Makes it also really difficult public-facing

1612
01:24:10,112 --> 01:24:11,904
Pieces of information to go from

1613
01:24:12,928 --> 01:24:17,024
Good job

1614
01:24:17,280 --> 01:24:18,048
Or new

1615
01:24:18,304 --> 01:24:19,584
It is expedient

1616
01:24:19,840 --> 01:24:24,704
Easier for him to do a bad job

1617
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:26,496
That's fair I know that Alex is stupid

1618
01:24:26,752 --> 01:24:29,312
But I know that he's also not as stupid as

1619
01:24:30,080 --> 01:24:30,592
Like

1620
01:24:34,688 --> 01:24:36,224
He's even

1621
01:24:36,736 --> 01:24:39,552
He's not as stupid as like

1622
01:24:39,808 --> 01:24:43,136
The caricature that you could have him based on how stupid you are

1623
01:24:47,744 --> 01:24:48,768
Took away my will to live

1624
01:24:51,328 --> 01:24:52,352
The rest of the show

1625
01:24:53,888 --> 01:24:55,424
Excited because Joe Rogan

1626
01:24:55,680 --> 01:24:56,960
Has fully announced

1627
01:24:59,264 --> 01:25:00,800
Unfortunately

1628
01:25:01,312 --> 01:25:03,360
It's also has to recognize that like

1629
01:25:03,872 --> 01:25:06,176
Rogan has come out and said that

1630
01:25:06,432 --> 01:25:07,712
Stuff that I said about

1631
01:25:07,968 --> 01:25:08,480
It wasn't

1632
01:25:08,736 --> 01:25:13,088
True Texas

1633
01:25:14,112 --> 01:25:14,880
I did make up some

1634
01:25:15,136 --> 01:25:17,184
Really

1635
01:25:18,976 --> 01:25:19,488
My job

1636
01:25:22,048 --> 01:25:22,560
Spotify

1637
01:25:28,448 --> 01:25:29,728
Elaborated on

1638
01:25:29,984 --> 01:25:30,752
Elaborate

1639
01:25:33,312 --> 01:25:35,360
Probably

1640
01:25:41,760 --> 01:25:42,784
I'm not going to pontificate

1641
01:25:44,064 --> 01:25:46,624
Probably smart

1642
01:25:47,392 --> 01:25:49,696
He said probably

1643
01:25:50,208 --> 01:25:51,488
Hyperbole

1644
01:25:51,744 --> 01:25:54,816
I probably made up some stuff

1645
01:25:55,072 --> 01:25:58,912
Joe Rogan

1646
01:25:59,168 --> 01:26:00,192
People who are

1647
01:26:00,704 --> 01:26:01,728
Completely nuts

1648
01:26:02,240 --> 01:26:03,520
And I really want

1649
01:26:04,288 --> 01:26:05,056
Play up my connect

1650
01:26:05,824 --> 01:26:07,104
Basically my best friend

1651
01:26:09,920 --> 01:26:10,432
When people talk

1652
01:26:12,736 --> 01:26:17,088
One really hard for me to relay information from other

1653
01:26:17,344 --> 01:26:19,648
Relation to you because it's all made up in my head

1654
01:26:23,232 --> 01:26:24,768
So Alex is selling a new product

1655
01:26:25,024 --> 01:26:26,560
It isn't actually new product

1656
01:26:26,816 --> 01:26:28,864
What time does the new product to clear out the warehouse

1657
01:26:29,376 --> 01:26:32,448
Shepherd

1658
01:26:32,960 --> 01:26:35,520
Only one solution

1659
01:26:36,288 --> 01:26:36,800
These

1660
01:26:39,616 --> 01:26:40,896
Almost

1661
01:26:43,456 --> 01:26:44,224
Sometimes write-up

1662
01:26:44,480 --> 01:26:45,248
Next to a cell tower

1663
01:26:45,504 --> 01:26:47,808
It'll still penetrate through dilip in your cell phone

1664
01:26:48,064 --> 01:26:49,344
Locations for your dad

1665
01:26:51,136 --> 01:26:51,648
Bill Clinton

1666
01:26:52,928 --> 01:26:53,440
What

1667
01:26:53,696 --> 01:26:56,768
Hillary Clinton under Global initiative with the NIH and the

1668
01:26:57,024 --> 01:26:59,072
You nwhl running Canta

1669
01:27:02,912 --> 01:27:03,680
An early as next year

1670
01:27:04,960 --> 01:27:08,544
They're already got your data or not

1671
01:27:10,592 --> 01:27:11,104
Doing it together

1672
01:27:11,360 --> 01:27:11,872
4 months ago

1673
01:27:23,904 --> 01:27:24,416
Your pocket

1674
01:27:24,928 --> 01:27:25,440
Faraday cage

1675
01:27:26,208 --> 01:27:27,232
Have units out there

1676
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:29,792
That are similar to this one

1677
01:27:30,304 --> 01:27:31,328
$35 online

1678
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:39,008
Foster's almost $12 a piece

1679
01:27:39,264 --> 01:27:40,032
Whoa

1680
01:27:40,544 --> 01:27:41,568
Comes into finder operation

1681
01:27:43,104 --> 01:27:45,664
19

1682
01:27:45,920 --> 01:27:48,480
They're so evil the cell phone

1683
01:27:48,736 --> 01:27:51,296
New product for Alex

1684
01:27:51,552 --> 01:27:55,392
He had this was like a junior varsity product you'd have like Owens

1685
01:27:56,672 --> 01:27:57,440
The block it pocket

1686
01:27:57,696 --> 01:27:58,208
That he had

1687
01:28:01,280 --> 01:28:02,560
Dignify it with

1688
01:28:02,816 --> 01:28:03,840
Cushing on his show

1689
01:28:04,096 --> 01:28:10,240
Unless it was like a really heavy 5G. Like you know

1690
01:28:12,032 --> 01:28:16,640
Or like my I don't know but I would imagine that like when Snowden went on Rogan

1691
01:28:16,896 --> 01:28:19,968
Maybe I'll try cell block

1692
01:28:20,224 --> 01:28:22,016
It's not here this and I'm like

1693
01:28:22,272 --> 01:28:23,040
Wow you're really

1694
01:28:24,576 --> 01:28:26,112
Okay

1695
01:28:29,184 --> 01:28:32,256
Alex wouldn't even waste his time trying to sell it to the Past

1696
01:28:33,536 --> 01:28:39,680
You don't even been selling it record your voice 17

1697
01:28:39,936 --> 01:28:44,544
The kids loved brother cell phones

1698
01:28:45,568 --> 01:28:50,688
You got a pronoun relegated to nobody listening gets to sell it that bad

1699
01:28:50,944 --> 01:28:52,224
Alex's

1700
01:28:52,480 --> 01:28:52,992
Southwick

1701
01:28:53,248 --> 01:28:54,016
Whatever

1702
01:28:54,784 --> 01:28:57,600
One thing I think is really interesting is that Alex

1703
01:28:58,368 --> 01:29:00,928
Really wants to insinuate himself with

1704
01:29:01,184 --> 01:29:03,232
The story about Sinclair and Eric Bolling

1705
01:29:05,280 --> 01:29:06,048
To know that like

1706
01:29:06,560 --> 01:29:09,120
Hey maybe I'm the source on this story

1707
01:29:10,656 --> 01:29:11,936
Fox News

Bowling show

1711
01:29:26,016 --> 01:29:27,552
Go

1712

1714
01:29:32,160 --> 01:29:32,928
When Coronavirus

1715
01:29:34,208 --> 01:29:35,488
Lucky back controversial Wuhan lab

1716
01:29:35,744 --> 01:29:38,560
U.s. dollars for risky

1717
01:29:39,072 --> 01:29:39,584
Newsweek

1718
01:29:39,840 --> 01:29:41,888
Newsweek look right there that's Newsweek

1719
01:29:44,448 --> 01:29:46,240
Coronavirus

1720
01:29:46,496 --> 01:29:47,008

1721
01:29:52,128 --> 01:29:52,896
2015

1722
01:29:54,176 --> 01:29:55,200
This is the reality

1723
01:29:55,712 --> 01:30:00,064
That might have been editorializing there but you see is covers news

1724
01:30:06,720 --> 01:30:12,352
Warped version of the headline that Alex's editorializing

1725
01:30:15,424 --> 01:30:15,936
Everyday

1726
01:30:18,240 --> 01:30:20,288
Really f***** up topics

1727
01:30:20,800 --> 01:30:23,616
I am screens about murder a lot

1728
01:30:24,128 --> 01:30:29,248
No that was Brian Stiles

1729
01:30:29,504 --> 01:30:33,600
For a while there, he was the one who with the same people

1730
01:30:40,256 --> 01:30:40,768
Look

1731
01:30:41,536 --> 01:30:43,072
I know it happens all the

1732
01:30:44,096 --> 01:30:46,144
Whenever he screams it like

1733
01:30:46,912 --> 01:30:47,936
That's Newsweek

1734
01:30:48,448 --> 01:30:49,472
As a way of life

1735
01:30:49,728 --> 01:30:50,240
Jeremiah

1736
01:30:51,008 --> 01:30:51,776
Yeah I know like

1737
01:30:52,032 --> 01:30:52,544
Everybody's

1738
01:30:53,312 --> 01:30:53,824
D

1739
01:30:54,080 --> 01:30:55,616
Even Newsweek is saying

1740
01:30:56,128 --> 01:30:57,152
Is him saying

1741
01:30:57,408 --> 01:30:59,200
That's a reliable news source

1742
01:30:59,712 --> 01:31:05,856
Highlight how unreliable

1743
01:31:06,112 --> 01:31:11,232
Exactly 100%

1744
01:31:13,024 --> 01:31:17,376
Video of the show

1745
01:31:17,888 --> 01:31:21,728
Now if they print anything I don't like fake news

1746
01:31:21,984 --> 01:31:23,008
Control

1747
01:31:23,264 --> 01:31:25,056
Obviously they're still more trustworthy

1748
01:31:26,080 --> 01:31:26,592
Undoubtedly

1749
01:31:27,360 --> 01:31:30,688
Talking about how

1750
01:31:30,944 --> 01:31:31,968
The dance we're going to go up

1751
01:31:32,992 --> 01:31:33,760
Wow

1752
01:31:34,016 --> 01:31:36,064
I think he's trying to get ahead of this

1753
01:31:36,320 --> 01:31:37,344
Might be

1754
01:31:37,600 --> 01:31:39,136
Something that he's going to have to spend

1755
01:31:39,392 --> 01:31:41,184
Yeah this is a weak effort

1756
01:31:44,512 --> 01:31:45,280
After going way down

1757
01:31:49,376 --> 01:31:52,192
Because July is when the new doctors and nurses come in

1758
01:31:52,704 --> 01:31:53,728
Weather

1759
01:31:55,776 --> 01:31:56,288
July effect

1760
01:31:58,336 --> 01:31:59,360
Statistics real information

1761
01:31:59,616 --> 01:32:00,640
Real research

1762
01:32:01,408 --> 01:32:07,040
The Joy effect of the real thing people discuss there isn't a consensus on whether or not

1763
01:32:07,296 --> 01:32:08,320
Actually a real thing

1764
01:32:09,088 --> 01:32:11,136
Do you hear from a 2017 article

1765
01:32:11,392 --> 01:32:12,672
The Canadian Association of Medicine

1766
01:32:12,928 --> 01:32:13,696
Journal

1767
01:32:14,720 --> 01:32:16,512
2016 analysis

1768
01:32:16,768 --> 01:32:20,864
Journal of patient safety data collected between 2011 and twenty

1769
01:32:21,376 --> 01:32:27,520
Nearly 120 academic medical centers in more than 300

1770
01:32:27,776 --> 01:32:28,288
Regions

1771
01:32:28,544 --> 01:32:29,312
In the United States

1772
01:32:30,080 --> 01:32:31,104
It concluded that there was

1773
01:32:31,360 --> 01:32:35,968
No evidence to support the July effect on Survival outcomes at USF

1774
01:32:36,224 --> 01:32:36,736
Medical Center

1775
01:32:37,760 --> 01:32:42,112
Studies focused on specific Specialties and patient populations have indicated mixed Brazil

1776
01:32:42,880 --> 01:32:44,928
Despite this lack of strong supporting evidence

1777
01:32:45,184 --> 01:32:48,256
A national survey

1778
01:32:48,512 --> 01:32:49,792
Published in 2016

1779
01:32:50,048 --> 01:32:52,096
In the American Journal of Medicine review

1780
01:32:52,352 --> 01:32:56,192
That most Internal Medicine Residency program leaders believe

1781
01:32:59,008 --> 01:33:02,336
A 2013 article in the Harvard Medical School review says quote

1782
01:33:02,592 --> 01:33:05,920
A new study published October 23rd in circulation

1783
01:33:06,176 --> 01:33:09,760
By researchers at Harvard Medical School Stanford University Hospital

1784
01:33:10,016 --> 01:33:13,088
University of Southern California and the Rand Corporation

1785
01:33:17,184 --> 01:33:20,000
Cases it is a serious concern for high-risk

1786
01:33:21,024 --> 01:33:22,304
That isn't too surprising

1787
01:33:22,560 --> 01:33:26,912
Given that experience doctors have more experience

1788
01:33:27,424 --> 01:33:29,728
But also the discrepancy isn't something that you

1789
01:33:29,984 --> 01:33:30,752
Should make people avoid

1790
01:33:31,008 --> 01:33:32,288
He's getting Healthcare in July

1791
01:33:33,056 --> 01:33:34,592
This is an issue that only relates

1792
01:33:34,848 --> 01:33:37,152
Teaching hospitals where there are

1793
01:33:37,664 --> 01:33:38,688
That's one factor

1794
01:33:39,456 --> 01:33:44,832
Hospitals have a lower risk of dying

1795
01:33:45,344 --> 01:33:46,368
But in July

1796
01:33:46,624 --> 01:33:47,136
The risk

1797
01:33:47,392 --> 01:33:51,744
Good teaching hospitals

1798
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:54,304
Okay about normal

1799
01:34:03,776 --> 01:34:06,080
Killing people at hospitals every summer

1800
01:34:09,920 --> 01:34:10,432
President

1801
01:34:10,688 --> 01:34:11,712
Is walking in

1802
01:34:12,224 --> 01:34:13,760
Acting all wacky

1803
01:34:14,016 --> 01:34:20,160
You know like forgetting all kinds of stuff in this earth

1804
01:34:22,464 --> 01:34:26,048
Who's this

1805
01:34:33,216 --> 01:34:34,496
Expect that for

1806
01:34:34,752 --> 01:34:35,520
People who are

1807
01:34:35,776 --> 01:34:36,544
In Greeley

1808
01:34:36,800 --> 01:34:37,824
Serious condition

1809
01:34:38,080 --> 01:34:41,152
That maybe are more difficult to diagnose so difficult

1810
01:34:41,408 --> 01:34:41,920
What's a handle

1811
01:34:42,432 --> 01:34:43,712
Someone who is not as a

1812
01:34:43,968 --> 01:34:44,480
Experienced

1813
01:34:45,504 --> 01:34:47,040
Could even with supervision

1814
01:34:47,552 --> 01:34:51,392
Could be less capable of taking care of that so you could imagine

1815
01:34:51,904 --> 01:34:53,440
Possible

1816
01:34:53,696 --> 01:34:55,744
Remember the things that I was reading

1817
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:57,792
The issue seems to be

1818
01:34:58,048 --> 01:35:00,608
Where is there can be

1819
01:35:00,864 --> 01:35:01,376
A problem

1820
01:35:01,632 --> 01:35:02,400
It's administrative

1821
01:35:02,656 --> 01:35:05,472
It's not if it's not a factor of

1822
01:35:05,728 --> 01:35:07,264
Whether or not residence

1823
01:35:07,776 --> 01:35:08,288
Can

1824
01:35:08,544 --> 01:35:10,080
Handle medical situation

1825
01:35:10,592 --> 01:35:13,664
It's more of circumstances like is this Hospital

1826
01:35:13,920 --> 01:35:15,200
Supervising people approach

1827
01:35:18,784 --> 01:35:19,296
Start a magical

1828
01:35:19,552 --> 01:35:20,320
Cool thing where there's

1829
01:35:20,576 --> 01:35:22,368
Bike tons more deaths in July

1830
01:35:23,136 --> 01:35:24,672
I was just trying to find a way to

1831
01:35:24,928 --> 01:35:28,000
To preemptively explain away why

1832
01:35:28,256 --> 01:35:31,840
We might see some

1833
01:35:32,096 --> 01:35:33,888
It's not because as we see cases rise

1834
01:35:34,400 --> 01:35:35,424
And we know that it

1835
01:35:35,680 --> 01:35:36,192
It's kind of

1836
01:35:36,960 --> 01:35:41,824
It's you kind of

1837
01:35:42,080 --> 01:35:42,848
Cases rise

1838
01:35:43,360 --> 01:35:45,664
A short. Of time we will

1839
01:35:46,688 --> 01:35:51,552
Start to rise

1840
01:35:51,808 --> 01:35:52,576
This will be Alex

1841
01:35:52,832 --> 01:35:53,856
How to spell July

1842
01:35:54,112 --> 01:35:55,648
Which is going to be interesting come August

1843
01:35:58,464 --> 01:36:01,536
Alex's return to Studio was worse

1844
01:36:01,792 --> 01:36:05,376
Then Saturday

1845
01:36:05,632 --> 01:36:07,936
I long for this Saturday

1846
01:36:08,448 --> 01:36:12,288
And uninspired

1847
01:36:21,248 --> 01:36:21,760
I do

1848
01:36:24,576 --> 01:36:29,696
I don't know why isn't racist

1849
01:36:29,952 --> 01:36:33,536
Without me

1850
01:36:33,792 --> 01:36:34,816
Killers that is

1851
01:36:35,072 --> 01:36:35,584
Kind of

1852
01:36:37,376 --> 01:36:41,472
Arguably absolutism in the same way

1853
01:36:41,728 --> 01:36:45,824
I definitely agree with people's right to protect themselves and be armed

1854
01:36:46,080 --> 01:36:48,384
There is

1855
01:36:48,640 --> 01:36:49,920
Valuable

1856
01:36:50,432 --> 01:36:52,480
Defending the Second Amendment

1857
01:36:53,504 --> 01:36:54,528
What extent

1858
01:36:55,296 --> 01:36:56,320
That's where the debate

1859
01:36:56,576 --> 01:36:57,088
SharkBite

1860
01:36:57,344 --> 01:36:59,648
I think it's one of the beliefs that Alex

1861
01:37:00,160 --> 01:37:01,952
Has the two Central to himself

1862
01:37:02,208 --> 01:37:04,512
That you could look at it as a political beliefs

1863
01:37:05,024 --> 01:37:06,560
But you can have a conversation about

1864
01:37:09,120 --> 01:37:11,168
Is white identity

1865
01:37:11,424 --> 01:37:12,192
And both of those things

1866
01:37:12,448 --> 01:37:14,240
Things I think

1867
01:37:15,776 --> 01:37:16,288
When the

1868
01:37:16,544 --> 01:37:17,824
Crumbling comes of the

1869
01:37:18,080 --> 01:37:18,848
The Second Amendment

1870
01:37:20,640 --> 01:37:21,408
You just got

1871
01:37:26,528 --> 01:37:28,320
Yeah yeah

1872
01:37:28,576 --> 01:37:29,344
You almost

1873
01:37:29,600 --> 01:37:33,184
Stretched bottom you got to do is get rid of wetness in lies

1874
01:37:33,440 --> 01:37:34,720
And then you're really up

1875
01:37:34,976 --> 01:37:41,120
Interesting one hand

1876
01:37:45,216 --> 01:37:46,752
Absolutely

1877
01:37:49,312 --> 01:37:51,872
Friday will be

1878
01:37:54,432 --> 01:37:59,296
It's knowledge right.com Twitter

1879
01:38:03,392 --> 01:38:09,536
Review you could please find a bail fund especially in your area and

1880

People doing the Lord

1881
01:38:12,864 --> 01:38:13,888
But until then

1882
01:38:14,144 --> 01:38:17,728
Western Civilization

1883
01:38:18,240 --> 01:38:21,056
Nicknames

1884
01:38:21,312 --> 01:38:26,688
And no there is not
