1
00:00:04,096 --> 00:00:10,240
Alexandra Thurston color with huge fan I love your work

2
00:00:16,384 --> 00:00:17,152
Damn

3
00:00:18,688 --> 00:00:24,832
If you were a necklace so mad

4
00:00:25,088 --> 00:00:31,232
Pre-show conversation

5
00:00:31,488 --> 00:00:35,584
Started with Britney Spears and that ended with

6
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:41,216
I believe

7
00:00:41,472 --> 00:00:43,520
But if the means are getting everybody murdered

8
00:00:43,776 --> 00:00:44,800
Maybe change your f****** mean

9
00:00:47,104 --> 00:00:50,176
We're putting that aside I would save the day

10
00:00:50,688 --> 00:00:51,968
If you were that

11
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:55,808
Are you

12
00:00:56,064 --> 00:01:02,208
I don't even know I'm too on my deals just from the job

13
00:01:02,464 --> 00:01:04,000
I was I was sleeping

14
00:01:05,024 --> 00:01:11,168
Clearly much like Lazarus I have

15
00:01:11,424 --> 00:01:12,192
From the tomb

16
00:01:12,448 --> 00:01:18,592
Describing this show to Lazarus

17
00:01:18,848 --> 00:01:20,384
Okay I know a lot about

18
00:01:21,152 --> 00:01:25,248
And my buddy over here I don't know shitt

19
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:29,600
So that's it that's the show that's out that's what we're all about

20
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:33,440
Sorry there's a need to at least look

21
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,024
We did

22
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:43,424
Sincerely argue about Britney Spears music for about 15 minutes and that led into an argument

23
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,008
Whether or not it's okay to act like the other side

24
00:01:47,264 --> 00:01:49,824
Whether or not it's appropriate adopted the tactics

25
00:01:50,336 --> 00:01:53,408
Of your enemies when they are children

26
00:01:53,664 --> 00:01:58,016
It's not a stupid question I rejected V

27
00:01:58,272 --> 00:01:59,552
And that's why we lose

28
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:01,088
Anyway

29
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:02,624
Not going to make us lose

30
00:02:07,232 --> 00:02:12,608
Still couple of new donors this first one

31
00:02:14,912 --> 00:02:15,936
Smokey Copeland

32
00:02:16,448 --> 00:02:17,728
Ewok

33
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:19,008

Thank you so much

35
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:38,208
Positive things about probably but I don't actually know who they are

36
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:46,144
Argued with frequently

37
00:02:46,656 --> 00:02:47,680
Thank you so much Robert

38
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:55,360
Appreciate that thank you so much Robert there's two that was really great sir

39
00:03:00,736 --> 00:03:02,784
But Robert Arista project

40
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,536
People really just want to hear the Brittany

41
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:14,304
A argument

42
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:19,168
We should we should record a depression I want to say

43
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:25,312
Episode ass off

44
00:03:25,568 --> 00:03:31,712
We're already like the month I got I got all kinds of fire and fury

45
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:34,784
Time to f****** fight

46
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:35,552
Rough

47
00:03:35,808 --> 00:03:41,952
Not into this episode for today

48
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:44,000
Did you know the 2009

49
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:48,096
Maybe we need a little bit of a shift

50
00:03:48,352 --> 00:03:51,680
Is the weather decided to do is look into Project Camelot

51
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:53,216
And I found

52
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:56,288
Some of that you want to talk about

53
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,104
Yeah the disappointment in your voice

54
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,640
Says to me that we're not doing

55
00:04:01,664 --> 00:04:02,432
I thought the subject

56
00:04:02,688 --> 00:04:03,200
It's way too big

57
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:14,464
Project Camelot hilarious story to tell you as soon as I can

58
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,024
Necessary research

59
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,559
That's on the back burner

60
00:04:18,815 --> 00:04:21,375
It was like alright modern-day Alex it is

61
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:23,679
Coordinates on Monday

62
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:29,311
So I looked on Sunday like

63
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:31,871
This is no good either I'm not going to do this episode

64
00:04:32,127 --> 00:04:33,919
What's falls into my lap

65
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:35,455
But people posting

66
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:36,223
Alex

67
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:37,759
Tweeting out a video

68
00:04:38,015 --> 00:04:39,551
Okay Mike Austin Bernie Sanders

69
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:45,951
LAX airport

70
00:04:46,207 --> 00:04:52,351
Yeah stuff that I want to see I'm not allowed to I didn't tag you in

71
00:04:54,143 --> 00:05:00,287
Alright

72
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:02,079
It's really

73
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:05,407
It's really a bummer it's it's really an indication of how

74
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:11,807
Pressing the s*** is getting in the present-day Mike Rotondo stuff the guy

75
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:13,343
Wooden house

76
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:15,391
Him being on Alex Jones Show

77
00:05:16,415 --> 00:05:17,439
It goes

78
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:19,487
It walks the line from like

79
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:22,559
This is kind of funny and weird

80
00:05:22,815 --> 00:05:26,399
This is really sad this is becoming a very sad story

81
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:28,447
The American office in British

82
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:29,983
Subway

83
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:31,007
Like when he's

84
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:34,335
Trying to harass Bernie Sanders in the airport

85
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:35,871
It's like

86
00:05:36,127 --> 00:05:36,639
Stitches

87
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:37,663
This is not funny

88
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:39,967
He's got his done along with him

89
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:42,783
Hey son is yelling questions at Bernie

90
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:50,463
I don't think you do that unless you know his son's voice

91
00:05:50,975 --> 00:05:52,511
And stuff like that

92
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:54,559
The bomber

93
00:05:56,351 --> 00:06:02,495
Specifically like that's a stimulant kind of

94
00:06:02,751 --> 00:06:06,591
Evidence of it but like that kind of behavior I haven't seen outside of people who do like

95
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:07,615
Coke

96
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:10,175
I don't know if his

97
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:11,199
His supplements

98
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:13,247
Create the same kind of

99
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:14,527
Affect

100
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:16,063
He's sweaty

101
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:17,343
Not from running

102
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:20,671
He's just sweaty and like disheveled

103
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:21,439
And

104
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:23,743
Grinding his jaw

105
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:26,047
Bother an old Senator at the airport

106
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:27,071
And it seems like

107
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:32,703
This made me love it or leave it

108
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:33,471
It made me

109
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:37,823
So sad. Because I love Bernie or anything like that

110
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:39,871
This is Bank.

111
00:06:41,151 --> 00:06:43,199
So I decided let's stay in the past

112
00:06:43,711 --> 00:06:44,479
And we are going

113
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:47,295
To continue on with 2009

114
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:48,063
Business

115
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:53,183
February 4th and February 5th episode

116
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:55,487
All right here is an out-of-context drop

117
00:06:57,791 --> 00:07:00,351
Don Mann flecainide

118
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:05,215
Alright alright alright alright

119
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:10,847
That is the kind of

120
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:12,639
White

121
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:16,223
I'm fine are you fine with time

122
00:07:21,343 --> 00:07:24,159
We got we got to start at year on February 4th

123
00:07:24,415 --> 00:07:25,439
2009

124
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:27,487
Yes

125
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:29,023
A week and a half

126
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:30,559
Roundabout

127
00:07:30,815 --> 00:07:31,327
2 weeks

128
00:07:31,839 --> 00:07:34,143
Into Barack Obama's presidency

129
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:36,191
Still boggles

130
00:07:36,447 --> 00:07:37,215
That we keep

131
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:38,239
Saying that because

132
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:39,775
Is it like in 2 weeks

133
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:42,079
Not even Jesse starts with

134
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:48,735
Obama's already going to kills man the battle station

135
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:51,807
Spiral further out of control

136
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:54,623
At the same time Obama is just like

137
00:07:55,135 --> 00:07:55,647
Moving in

138
00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:59,231
You just got people within like Michelle is like

139
00:07:59,487 --> 00:08:05,631
Get rid of that f****** couch George W bush is a f****** a******

140
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:13,311
Anyway here's where his head's at on February 4th

141
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:19,711
Star67

142
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:33,279
Okay

143
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:37,887
You've been fairly contradictory within the same sentence

144
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:38,655
I don't think

145
00:08:39,167 --> 00:08:40,447
Bush ever had a 92 /

146
00:08:41,471 --> 00:08:42,495
I don't think so

147
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:44,031
Possible

148
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:45,311
Alex

149
00:08:45,567 --> 00:08:46,335
In inaugural

150
00:08:46,591 --> 00:08:50,431
Inauguration

151
00:08:50,687 --> 00:08:55,807
Vienna a bombing at an inauguration

152
00:08:56,063 --> 00:08:58,111
You have become

153
00:08:58,367 --> 00:09:04,511
Just a. Like I said you were adjective

154
00:09:04,767 --> 00:09:10,399
Okay I'll go with you

155
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:13,471
I got

156
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:15,519
I'm just I'm just going by contact

157
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:16,287
Clues he might

158
00:09:16,543 --> 00:09:18,335
Still believe that the inauguration has

159
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:31,903
Roku I forgot I was on the day of the inauguration so I don't remember

160
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:33,695
Actually Megyn Kelly

161
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:41,375
A little bit of a past and a little bit of leeway because his head is still in a really f***** up play

162
00:09:41,887 --> 00:09:43,935
Because the FEMA camp

163
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:46,495
House resolution

164
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:48,287
Yazzy

165
00:09:48,543 --> 00:09:49,567
Dissenters

166
00:09:50,079 --> 00:09:51,871
Rides at

167
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:54,687
And I'm getting confirmation

168
00:09:54,943 --> 00:09:56,479
Tim from the chat room that

169
00:09:56,991 --> 00:10:01,599
D2 right after right after 9/11

170
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:07,999
It's pretty high Erica sucks you know but you know how it goes

171
00:10:08,255 --> 00:10:08,767
You America

172
00:10:09,535 --> 00:10:12,863
Announcer

173
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:16,191
Never really

174
00:10:17,471 --> 00:10:17,983
What's up

175
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:18,751
I mean if he

176
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:24,383
He saying that they announce

177
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:54,847
What he's describing is basically like the back page of Mad Magazine

178
00:10:55,103 --> 00:11:01,247
Dinosaur movie like the number 47

179
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:07,647
Overlay these bills on top of each other

180
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:12,255
He's copying a cutting and pasting different magazine articles and sending it in the letter

181
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:16,351
Exactly right

182
00:11:16,607 --> 00:11:17,887
Precisely right

183
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:30,687
The only book he ever brings up when he talks about reading books about Nazis

184
00:11:30,943 --> 00:11:31,967
Books about now

185
00:11:32,735 --> 00:11:33,247
But hold on

186
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:37,599
All about

187
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:41,951
How to control

188
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:45,791
I probably read

189
00:11:46,815 --> 00:11:49,887
On The Purge

190
00:11:57,055 --> 00:11:58,847
Admitting

191
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:03,199
They say

192
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:10,367
The only way to get up to those numbers is to include a mismanagement and famine stuff like that

193
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:17,023
We only killed 60 million

194
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:19,071
People that we

195
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:23,167
And I'd studied with the professors

196
00:12:23,423 --> 00:12:24,191
That were pretty accomplished

197
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:25,471
Some pretty like

198
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:26,495
Seriously

199
00:12:26,751 --> 00:12:27,263
Credible

200
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:29,055
Sources

201
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:35,455
Yeah they read big-time players

202
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:39,807
Legitimately most scholars in the world

203
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:41,087
About oral tradition

204
00:12:41,599 --> 00:12:43,391
For a class I took on homeric Greek

205
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:46,207
Okay I started with another group Professor who was

206
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:47,231
Nationally

207
00:12:47,487 --> 00:12:52,863
Recognize in the world of Greek studies class from a guy

208
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:54,911
Who was probably in the top

209
00:12:55,167 --> 00:12:57,727
Three Cheese's nail rapper

210
00:12:57,983 --> 00:12:59,007
Yeah but that's not the point

211
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:01,055
Wannabe high-level Scholars

212
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:02,591
World of like

213
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:05,151
Alexander

214
00:13:05,407 --> 00:13:10,527
Mesopotamia

215
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:11,295
I'm not

216
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:16,415
I'm saying what did I never heard from any of them is how many books they read

217
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:18,463
Not once

218
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:21,279
Did Professor McClure come over and say like

219
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:24,607
Hey look you should listen to what I think about

220
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:27,679
Because I've read 75 books about home

221
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:31,263
Well maglu had those big coke bottle glasses and he would always walk

222
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:34,335
Can it was a shock

223
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:41,247
Delightful

224
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:47,647
Mike's amazing conversationalist so I'm just saying it whenever I hear someone

225
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:49,951
Once a like I read this many books

226
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:50,975
On this stuff

227
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:53,023
What I hear is you haven't asked

228
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:57,119
Because people who are actual Scholars on stuff don't really

229
00:13:57,887 --> 00:13:58,655
They were doing

230
00:14:00,447 --> 00:14:01,471
But why

231
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:04,799
So you

232
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:06,335
As a way to impress be

233
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:09,919
That's the only reason that you would say 50 or 60 bucks

234
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:15,551
That's because the people that you are talking to are illiterate never have read 50 books

235
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:19,903
But I don't understand why you think that's a good

236
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:23,743
Because if you're reading 50 or 60 books about Nazi

237
00:14:23,999 --> 00:14:25,791
Really there's only

238
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:28,095
Maybe a few perspectives that you

239
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:29,119
You can have about

240
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:31,679
You got it

241
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:33,471
Yeah exactly

242
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:35,519
Bad genocide

243
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:37,311
Superbad

244
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:41,919
It did happen if your book number 4

245
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:44,991
Then you're getting into Wild

246
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:50,367
You're either a scholar

247
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:53,439
And you teach

248
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:56,767
Venus of the six other books

249
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:59,071
Did you read looking for an argument

250
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:02,399
You know you're looking for something to backup your feelings

251
00:15:02,655 --> 00:15:05,727
Maybe the Nazis weren't so bad

252
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:07,519
Alex

253
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:10,079
Some people don't

254
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:11,871
Talk about is real

255
00:15:16,735 --> 00:15:19,551
They can't believe the shows for real

256
00:15:19,807 --> 00:15:22,623
I'm for real

257
00:15:24,159 --> 00:15:26,975
In this prominent of a fashion would actually get up

258
00:15:32,351 --> 00:15:38,239
Of course

259
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:42,591
I'm looking

260
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:45,407
I know

261
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:56,415
I know they

262
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:07,935
And frankly I'm into Humanity

263
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:09,471
Live forever

264
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:15,359
Is that like to play

265
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:27,903
I love you

266
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:28,927
Okay

267
00:16:29,183 --> 00:16:31,999
So the only reason that I can't equip as long as

268
00:16:32,255 --> 00:16:33,279
Cuz it's kind of derivative

269
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:38,655
Before 2009

270
00:16:38,911 --> 00:16:44,031
Did that same s*** that like I'm Immortal as long as my lying is here in the past

271
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:47,359
Is living on through me ago

272
00:16:47,615 --> 00:16:49,407
He

273
00:16:49,663 --> 00:16:52,223
Peace

274
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:58,111
Of his weird spirituality made me uncomfortable here in 2009

275
00:16:58,367 --> 00:17:04,511
Like the genetic mysticism bulshit if you're like 40 and you got a few kids and like

276
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:10,911
Like Spiral paranoia I could see it

277
00:17:15,263 --> 00:17:19,359
Since he was like 9 he's like by age

278
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:21,663
Fairy clothes

279
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:23,455
So that's crazy

280
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:25,247
Very interesting

281
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:29,599
That's like a Perpetual in the background

282
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:32,415
I meant secondarily I kept all that in because

283
00:17:32,671 --> 00:17:34,463
He doesn't really care even about like

284
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:35,999
The things you saying it's all just

285
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:39,327
Avenue for him to be like yes this is real

286
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:40,607
What does that mean

287
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:42,143
That means I'm big boy

288
00:17:42,399 --> 00:17:43,423
I am a big boy

289
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:47,263
Believe the show is real because if it's real that means I'm

290
00:17:47,519 --> 00:17:48,543
Super Brave

291
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:51,615
Kind of what you trying to reinforce in his audience

292
00:17:52,127 --> 00:17:55,199
I kind of feel uncomfortable with anybody who's really in

293
00:17:57,759 --> 00:18:03,903
Black Levi's 501

294
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:11,071
Paul Stanley

295
00:18:14,399 --> 00:18:18,495
Even even another like a certain way

296
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:20,287
Ancestry.com bulshit

297
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:21,567
Because the wolf

298
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:22,335
The only way

299
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:28,479
Reason that you are looking that stuff up is like this Lottery idea of maybe it's

300
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:29,759
Maybe my jeans are

301
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:34,367
Special he is kind of what I'm hearing when you start looking up

302
00:18:34,623 --> 00:18:36,671
Where is my genetic lineage from

303
00:18:36,927 --> 00:18:38,207
There's a party that thing

304
00:18:38,463 --> 00:18:38,975
I need

305
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:41,535
Need to know this because maybe it's really special

306
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:45,887
People might be motivated by that but also its

307
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:46,655
Justice like a b

308
00:18:46,911 --> 00:18:47,423
Some people are just like

309
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:48,959
Isn't this curious

310
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:54,847
I'm kind of curious about.

311
00:18:55,103 --> 00:18:56,895
Too much

312
00:18:57,151 --> 00:18:57,919
I don't know if there's any

313
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:02,783
The appropriate diet

314
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:04,831
You should have this based on where you

315
00:19:05,087 --> 00:19:06,367
Your genetic

316
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:07,647
The history is

317
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:09,439
Like where your ancestors are from

318
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:15,071
I don't know if I should admit that put chicken fingers and fries

319
00:19:15,327 --> 00:19:18,143
I don't know propriate diet for my way

320
00:19:18,399 --> 00:19:21,727
Don't know where that would be geographically but

321
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:23,519
I don't think you're right

322
00:19:26,079 --> 00:19:27,359
Explains that the globalist

323
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:29,151
Yes

324
00:19:29,663 --> 00:19:31,455
Are super afraid of the Patriots

325
00:19:31,967 --> 00:19:33,759
And then he tries to scare his

326
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:39,647
They have called us out and they admit their own counsel

327
00:19:40,415 --> 00:19:41,439
That they are

328
00:19:41,695 --> 00:19:43,999
Invincible

329
00:19:55,519 --> 00:20:00,383
Clip is much longer than this but I want to point out that if that is true

330
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:01,663
In any way

331
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:02,431
Yep

332
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:07,295
It's really not that hard to make them fall

333
00:20:07,551 --> 00:20:08,575
Yep Alex

334
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:11,903
Conceivably has been doing these videos been doing since then

335
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:18,303
For that 10 years so if the globalist all you have to do is call them out in like right

336
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:19,071
Already

337
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:19,839
Terrified

338
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:22,399
Have you standing up all you have to do is stand up

339
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:24,191
It's been 10 years

340
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:27,263
Furthermore

341
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:28,031
Furthermore

342
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:30,335
They're going to kill the president

343
00:20:30,591 --> 00:20:31,615
Is that

344
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:33,151
If they don't

345
00:20:33,407 --> 00:20:33,919
The globalist

346
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:35,711
He will not

347
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:36,991
Make it 10 for the

348
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:40,575
Write your family

349
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:42,879
When he says the globalist count

350
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:45,439
Sprite do you see robes and hoods

351
00:20:45,695 --> 00:20:51,839
100 Global account

352
00:20:52,095 --> 00:20:57,471
Nobody can see each others face

353
00:20:57,983 --> 00:20:58,495
These nuts

354
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:03,359
Nature of their attack

355
00:21:03,615 --> 00:21:06,431
Is so over-the-top

356
00:21:08,479 --> 00:21:10,015
It's 2

357
00:21:12,831 --> 00:21:17,952
Collapse

358
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:39,456
About that

359
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:46,368
Jeff Martin auctions

360
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:49,184
Pictures of

361
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:52,000
Boulder dash

362
00:21:52,512 --> 00:21:53,024
Like it

363
00:21:55,072 --> 00:21:56,096
A a frog

364
00:21:57,376 --> 00:22:01,728
You got to follow it up with something better

365
00:22:02,496 --> 00:22:04,288
I would hazard

366
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:11,712
It is not your government has been hijacked

367
00:22:13,504 --> 00:22:17,344
The state government

368
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:22,976
Do not be reason that I kept that in so long

369
00:22:23,232 --> 00:22:24,000
Is babe

370
00:22:24,256 --> 00:22:25,280
We're just seeing some fear

371
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:29,376
Also based on like

372
00:22:29,888 --> 00:22:33,216
The globalist are afraid to but you should be really right there

373
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:39,872
But then at the end there we continue this be at this thesis that I started

374
00:22:40,128 --> 00:22:41,408
Representing our last episode

375
00:22:41,664 --> 00:22:42,688
Which is the Alex

376
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:43,712
Hate

377
00:22:43,968 --> 00:22:44,480
Government

378
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:46,784
To destroy

379
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:53,184
Big government specially state and local government that's the weird part at the end there I don't know about local

380
00:22:53,696 --> 00:22:54,976
Cousin rappers local

381
00:22:55,232 --> 00:22:57,024
He said that the federal government

382
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:57,792
Nokia

383
00:22:58,304 --> 00:23:00,864
Is controlled by treaties

384
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,656
Governments are

385
00:23:02,912 --> 00:23:03,680
Which is crazy

386
00:23:03,936 --> 00:23:05,984
Now they're controlled by international trade

387
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,008
GoNoodle

388
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:09,312
What is what is he in favor of

389
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:15,712
I don't know like you just want states rights and I understand

390
00:23:15,968 --> 00:23:20,832
Beats are also controlled by these globalist International nonsense

391
00:23:21,088 --> 00:23:22,112
You know who's not controlled

392
00:23:22,624 --> 00:23:24,416
Sheriff's must be must be

393
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:29,280
How do you have a strut how do you do that like how do you have a city

394
00:23:29,536 --> 00:23:30,560
BV largest

395
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:31,840
For a County

396
00:23:32,096 --> 00:23:33,120
How do you know

397
00:23:33,376 --> 00:23:33,888
No counties

398
00:23:34,144 --> 00:23:37,984
The county governments could also be subject to for and treat

399
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,032
You know what my city is your home

400
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:40,800
Dave

401
00:23:41,312 --> 00:23:41,824
Couple guys

402
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:48,224
We all have a little bit doesn't go anywhere connected

403
00:23:49,504 --> 00:23:50,272
You are now

404
00:23:50,528 --> 00:23:54,624
I don't know how the secretary of state was actually brilliant

405
00:23:56,416 --> 00:23:58,720
As a propaganda technique

406
00:23:58,976 --> 00:24:01,536
Very thirsty where the sentence called

407
00:24:01,792 --> 00:24:02,560
Carbon tax

408
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:03,328
Is paid to the

409
00:24:03,584 --> 00:24:05,632
The banks

410
00:24:05,888 --> 00:24:07,936
F****** genius

411
00:24:08,192 --> 00:24:08,704
Genius

412
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:09,472
Because

413
00:24:09,728 --> 00:24:10,496
No

414
00:24:10,752 --> 00:24:14,336
F****** stupid that would never happen and that's insane

415
00:24:14,848 --> 00:24:18,432
But everybody hates the banks because they destroyed the world

416
00:24:18,688 --> 00:24:24,832
Bedtime

417
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:26,880
It's the same thing that he says about your taxes

418
00:24:27,136 --> 00:24:28,672
He says that all federal taxes

419
00:24:29,184 --> 00:24:32,256
You pay go directly to pay off the national debt

420
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:35,584
Right on the money that's owed to the Federal Reserve

421
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:39,168
So all of your taxes are going straight to the Federal Reserve

422
00:24:39,424 --> 00:24:40,704
Complete lie about a quote

423
00:24:42,496 --> 00:24:43,008
Kumquat

424
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,288
Sweets

425
00:24:45,056 --> 00:24:48,640
Misrepresentation what he was talking about

426
00:24:48,896 --> 00:24:49,920
Supernatural

427
00:24:50,176 --> 00:24:54,016
And then because of this none dare call it conspiracy that I'm doing

428
00:24:54,528 --> 00:24:55,552
Juno's Lake

429
00:24:55,808 --> 00:24:57,600
Who owns most of the federal debt

430
00:24:57,856 --> 00:24:58,880
Like the national debt

431
00:24:59,648 --> 00:25:01,440
Cuz it ain't the Federal Reserve

432
00:25:01,952 --> 00:25:03,488
Isn't it

433
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:04,768
Call bunch

434
00:25:05,024 --> 00:25:06,816
But it's not the only like maybe

435
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:10,400
Best Western music

436
00:25:10,912 --> 00:25:17,056
Yeah isn't it Vons and such a lot of it is private investors

437
00:25:17,312 --> 00:25:20,128
Private investment

438
00:25:20,384 --> 00:25:21,408
Search for Ian or

439
00:25:21,664 --> 00:25:27,808
Domestic its private Investments also gone come out of Social Security and s*** like that

440
00:25:28,064 --> 00:25:31,904
Good Investments like all this stuff is all just

441
00:25:32,416 --> 00:25:33,184
Not really

442
00:25:33,696 --> 00:25:35,232
Much more complicated pictures

443
00:25:36,256 --> 00:25:36,768
Anyway

444
00:25:37,792 --> 00:25:39,072
I need a certain sense you could

445
00:25:39,328 --> 00:25:44,192
Consider a hedge fund buying up a s*** ton of bond

446
00:25:44,704 --> 00:25:46,752
I suppose like that that's a good way of looking at

447
00:25:48,544 --> 00:25:54,688
But it's not investment in the continued existence of the United

448
00:25:54,944 --> 00:25:57,248
Those bonds are meaningless

449
00:25:57,504 --> 00:26:01,600
If you are trying to overthrow the government

450
00:26:03,136 --> 00:26:03,648
Care about my

451
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:08,000
All you're doing is a nefarious flared not caring about nothing

452
00:26:08,256 --> 00:26:08,768
Right which is

453
00:26:11,328 --> 00:26:16,448
Behavior usually a huge thing headphones headphones

454
00:26:16,704 --> 00:26:17,472
So

455
00:26:19,008 --> 00:26:19,776
Tristan Wilds.

456
00:26:20,032 --> 00:26:21,056
But

457
00:26:21,568 --> 00:26:23,616
I got to keep trying to keep moving the block

458
00:26:23,872 --> 00:26:28,224
I feel like we're coming out of a little bit

459
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:31,040
Slow and a little bit of it is because of our

460
00:26:31,552 --> 00:26:32,832
Fight at the top of the show

461
00:26:33,088 --> 00:26:34,368
I meant another bit of it is

462
00:26:34,624 --> 00:26:35,136
But he's clips

463
00:26:35,392 --> 00:26:36,160
Or just kind of

464
00:26:36,416 --> 00:26:38,208
A little bit slow here at the king

465
00:26:38,464 --> 00:26:39,232
I promise you

466
00:26:39,744 --> 00:26:44,864
We're going to get exam my favorite stuff ever heard of the show

467
00:26:45,632 --> 00:26:49,216
There's a pattern pattern to plays out over the course

468
00:26:49,472 --> 00:26:51,008
These two days

469
00:26:51,264 --> 00:26:51,776
Just makes me laugh

470
00:26:52,288 --> 00:26:53,056
So f****** hard

471
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:54,080
You're going to love it

472
00:26:54,336 --> 00:26:56,384
I don't know why

473
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:02,784
Hey guys stick around don't know I don't like that last one

474
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:05,344
Self-conscious about that last clip

475
00:27:07,904 --> 00:27:10,208
I didn't get to go out today

476
00:27:10,464 --> 00:27:11,744
I slept in a little bit

477
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:12,768
This next

478
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:15,584
Buddy

479
00:27:16,352 --> 00:27:16,864
Bloody

480
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:17,632
Hey buddy

481
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:21,216
I'm doing a lot of finger guns at lately

482
00:27:21,472 --> 00:27:23,520
And this isn't how are you not having a great day

483
00:27:25,824 --> 00:27:27,616
Text Alex talks about

484
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,368
He talks about what it's like

485
00:27:38,624 --> 00:27:40,928
Like to be on the phone with a globulin

486
00:27:44,256 --> 00:27:46,048
You talk about this guy I believe it's

487
00:27:46,304 --> 00:27:49,888
Thomas Barnett is his name

488
00:27:50,144 --> 00:27:52,448
You was going to do an interview with that we've heard him talk about this

489
00:27:55,776 --> 00:27:59,872
Stop us Atlantic bait apparently you started

490
00:28:00,384 --> 00:28:03,712
Slithering lizard on that

491
00:28:08,064 --> 00:28:08,832
Moses I don't know

492
00:28:10,368 --> 00:28:12,416
Extended impression of what it's like

493
00:28:12,672 --> 00:28:14,720
To be on the other end of the phone with the Cowboys

494
00:28:15,232 --> 00:28:15,744
When is next flight

495
00:28:59,008 --> 00:29:01,056
Controller

496
00:29:10,016 --> 00:29:14,880
Just checking

497
00:29:26,144 --> 00:29:28,192
I don't like any of those

498
00:29:29,216 --> 00:29:31,776
There you go

499
00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:40,224
But wait

500
00:29:54,304 --> 00:29:55,072
Literally

501
00:30:03,008 --> 00:30:03,520
Never

502
00:30:03,776 --> 00:30:08,384
Since John Leguizamo

503
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:13,504
His one-man so fully embodied multiple characters

504
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:17,088
That was so bad

505
00:30:17,344 --> 00:30:19,136
Even though he tried to use an evil voice

506
00:30:19,648 --> 00:30:20,672
He had some great ideas

507
00:30:20,928 --> 00:30:21,952
I'm not going to lie to you

508
00:30:22,208 --> 00:30:25,536
I'm not going to lie to you that evil voice was really bugging killing it

509
00:30:27,328 --> 00:30:28,096
Maybe Alex

510
00:30:28,608 --> 00:30:29,120
On you

511
00:30:29,632 --> 00:30:31,168
If you start the phone call

512
00:30:31,424 --> 00:30:32,192
With we're going to

513
00:30:32,448 --> 00:30:32,960
To defeat you into

514
00:30:33,472 --> 00:30:38,080
Aggressive whatever answer you get in response to that

515
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:38,848
A little bit Europe

516
00:30:39,104 --> 00:30:45,248
You got to own a little bit as an adult

517
00:30:46,272 --> 00:30:49,088
Threaten to destroy it started with a high

518
00:30:49,344 --> 00:30:53,184
Maybe maybe even answer your family's doing you win some you lose some

519
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:57,024
He's trying to destroy the family

520
00:31:02,912 --> 00:31:09,056
The only impression he does on the show your f****** wrong ears the next one

521
00:31:09,312 --> 00:31:10,592
Bernie 415

522
00:31:10,848 --> 00:31:11,872
Most of this

523
00:31:12,384 --> 00:31:13,408
Legitimately

524
00:31:13,664 --> 00:31:14,176
Most

525
00:31:14,432 --> 00:31:18,528
The first hour of this program

526
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:25,696
Is it real quick little bit

527
00:31:25,952 --> 00:31:27,488
Little bit too similar to the previous

528
00:31:27,744 --> 00:31:33,888
This is actually an impression of like you talking about the globalist

529
00:31:34,144 --> 00:31:34,656
America Unearthed

530
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:43,104
Pretty close to after the last impression it's sort of another character but in that universe

531
00:31:43,616 --> 00:31:44,128
So you can

532
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:45,664
Here's my problem

533
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:48,224
Then I feel like you cut out the part

534
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:50,016
Of all these clips where he goes

535
00:31:50,272 --> 00:31:51,552
Do you guys like impressions

536
00:31:51,808 --> 00:31:55,648
It wouldn't be crazy if I

537
00:31:58,976 --> 00:32:00,000
What is

538
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:08,704
Literally right before the clip you were playing right now is be tonight

539
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:11,008
That's where we're at

540
00:32:36,352 --> 00:32:40,192

541
00:32:40,448 --> 00:32:46,080

This is the stand at Helm's Deep all the way

00:33:50,848 --> 00:33:52,640
In the Heart of Darkness

568
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:44,352
And that's

569
00:34:44,608 --> 00:34:45,632
The character of

570
00:34:45,888 --> 00:34:47,936
The person who is an evil spirit

571
00:34:48,192 --> 00:34:49,472
Write any dozen

572
00:34:49,728 --> 00:34:50,752
Vicente

573
00:34:52,288 --> 00:34:58,176
And then he just keeps going into unless you so to me it's like the voice is like

574
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:03,552
Doing is your not

575
00:35:03,808 --> 00:35:04,576
You're not

576
00:35:04,832 --> 00:35:06,112
The cuts that are happening

577
00:35:06,368 --> 00:35:12,512
Like

578
00:35:12,768 --> 00:35:18,912
There's a star White

579
00:35:19,168 --> 00:35:25,312
I feel like there's a star goes to

580
00:35:25,568 --> 00:35:31,712
But maybe wearing a bowler hat monocle

581
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:38,624
Mr. peanut

582
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:41,696
Nikes Peter Jennings on Masterpiece Theater

583
00:35:41,952 --> 00:35:46,304
Peter Jennings

584
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:49,632
I don't think you do either

585
00:35:51,424 --> 00:35:52,192
It's right

586
00:35:55,264 --> 00:35:57,056
What you lived

587
00:35:57,312 --> 00:35:57,824
True face

588
00:36:01,408 --> 00:36:03,456
The facsimile of real ale

589
00:36:03,712 --> 00:36:08,064
That's when he slides into his normal voice from that voice it's much easier transition

590
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:09,344
That's what you're saying

591
00:36:11,136 --> 00:36:12,416
Receive a crazy person

592
00:36:12,672 --> 00:36:13,440
Here's a

593
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:14,976
Big question

594
00:36:15,488 --> 00:36:17,536
And I think this is one that

595
00:36:17,792 --> 00:36:19,072
Really needs to be answered

596
00:36:19,328 --> 00:36:19,840
Specifically

597
00:36:20,608 --> 00:36:23,680
How long do promises think White

598
00:36:25,728 --> 00:36:31,872
Forever because if he if you forever

599
00:36:32,128 --> 00:36:37,248
F****** crazy we're the ancient enemy of the New World Order

600
00:36:37,504 --> 00:36:38,272
The Republic

601
00:36:38,528 --> 00:36:39,552
You specifically mean wife

602
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:42,112
Weedon Libby

603
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:49,024
And I mean I think only the Mormons think we've been here even before we don't talk

604
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:54,144
Order comes from the Bavarian Illuminati in the black nobility of Venice

605
00:36:57,472 --> 00:36:58,496
I could talk about that

606
00:37:00,032 --> 00:37:01,568
So they were Americans

607
00:37:01,824 --> 00:37:04,640
American Amerigo Vespucci

608
00:37:08,992 --> 00:37:10,272
There might be another f******

609
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:15,904
Researching about weather

610
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:19,488
Just can't agree that his

611
00:37:19,744 --> 00:37:20,768
His is the name

612
00:37:21,024 --> 00:37:26,400
Gary Allan lies about Christopher Columbus and what was going on around that.

613
00:37:26,656 --> 00:37:28,960
What gonorrhea I feel like gonorrhea is what

614
00:37:29,216 --> 00:37:32,032
Was going around along that time of it

615
00:37:32,288 --> 00:37:34,848
Research

616
00:37:35,104 --> 00:37:37,408
Appreciate as I pulled up a list of all the hosts

617
00:37:38,176 --> 00:37:39,712
Beasteater

618
00:37:40,992 --> 00:37:41,760
That is a hero

619
00:37:42,016 --> 00:37:43,296
John is a hero

620
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:44,576
I regret to save it

621
00:37:44,832 --> 00:37:48,672
None of those are the people I was thinking of don't know

622
00:37:48,928 --> 00:37:50,464
I don't know why

623
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:52,000
Diffusers newsman

624
00:37:52,256 --> 00:37:54,560
How about classic

625
00:38:00,448 --> 00:38:01,472
Was around when I was

626
00:38:01,984 --> 00:38:02,496
Watching it is

627
00:38:02,752 --> 00:38:03,520
The kid but

628
00:38:04,288 --> 00:38:07,360
The name does not ring a bell anyway

629
00:38:08,128 --> 00:38:08,896
Russell Peters

630
00:38:09,152 --> 00:38:09,664
I hear it's David

631
00:38:10,176 --> 00:38:13,504
2009

632
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:14,272
Sofia liners

633
00:38:14,528 --> 00:38:15,552
Alright

634
00:38:15,808 --> 00:38:17,088
Vet vet

635
00:38:20,672 --> 00:38:21,184
I can

636
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:22,464
Help but feel like that

637
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:23,744
That felt like an audition

638
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:24,512
Monologue

639
00:38:25,024 --> 00:38:30,400
Okay I can see that you know that

640
00:38:30,656 --> 00:38:31,936
Let me show you what I can

641
00:38:32,192 --> 00:38:32,704
Can do

642
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:33,472
Like he's

643
00:38:33,728 --> 00:38:39,872
He's impressed nobody's listening that's not the audience in Macbeth

644
00:38:40,128 --> 00:38:42,944
Which radar is that place

645
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:48,320
You know that's what he's doing

646
00:38:49,344 --> 00:38:55,232
Lookout Ford Ranger

647
00:38:55,744 --> 00:38:59,840
I don't know I don't think that's necessarily I don't think I'm accurate I don't think I'm right

648
00:39:00,864 --> 00:39:01,376
It felt like that

649
00:39:01,888 --> 00:39:03,424
Look what I was listening to it I felt like

650
00:39:03,936 --> 00:39:05,216
This is a demonstration of

651
00:39:05,472 --> 00:39:07,520
Skills this is almost like a nuclear attack

652
00:39:07,776 --> 00:39:10,592
What we're capable of

653
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:13,920
Alex is going into all these demon voices in like

654
00:39:14,688 --> 00:39:15,200
Playground

655
00:39:16,992 --> 00:39:21,856
Pretty pretty pretty pretty strong demonstration of everything that's in your tool kit

656
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:24,672
When did you want to put him in a play

657
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:26,720
Like for real

658
00:39:26,976 --> 00:39:32,096
Dover Delaware

659
00:39:32,352 --> 00:39:34,400
No I don't like falls on his head

660
00:39:34,656 --> 00:39:38,240
Made me really just the way that we neutralize Alex's world

661
00:39:38,496 --> 00:39:39,520
Alex

662
00:39:39,776 --> 00:39:45,920
You might be a good actor let's just putting him in like Off-Broadway plays and then maybe

663
00:39:46,176 --> 00:39:46,944
Now maybe

664
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:49,504
Text now maybe he

665
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,040
Baby starts to really

666
00:39:51,296 --> 00:39:51,808
Fuel

667
00:39:54,368 --> 00:39:57,440
I hate to try to remember plays now

668
00:39:57,952 --> 00:40:00,512
First of all used to know a lot about him first of all

669
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:04,096
Alex Jones is not going to work and live theater for a number of reasons

670
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,168
We know that

671
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:17,664
Put it in Tire segment of that like possibility is

672
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:23,040
Call plays a very marketable commodity in that world because you can't sing

673
00:40:23,296 --> 00:40:24,576
At for musicals

674
00:40:24,832 --> 00:40:29,952
Except for doing the comedy roles who don't have signal in the musical

675
00:40:30,208 --> 00:40:31,488
He done that with me the timing

676
00:40:31,744 --> 00:40:33,280
We can't put those roles

677
00:40:33,536 --> 00:40:35,072
Now he also can't dance

678
00:40:36,096 --> 00:40:36,608
So

679
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:39,168
I mean

680
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:41,984
You just got to put your heart

681
00:40:42,752 --> 00:40:43,264
Hearing

682
00:40:43,520 --> 00:40:44,032
From the chat remedies

683
00:40:45,312 --> 00:40:47,104
Goodwill drop off

684
00:40:48,384 --> 00:40:49,408
We get to the first

685
00:40:51,968 --> 00:40:52,992
Alex has Gaston

686
00:40:53,504 --> 00:40:54,528
Video of nevermind

687
00:40:55,296 --> 00:40:57,856
He has a broadcast over the course of these two

688
00:40:58,112 --> 00:40:59,648
That's not a good thing problem do at all

689
00:40:59,904 --> 00:41:01,952
This first one is a gentleman by the name

690
00:41:03,232 --> 00:41:05,536
UCLA law professor

691
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:11,680
And this is why Alex wants to

692
00:41:12,448 --> 00:41:13,216
He's going to set up

693
00:41:13,472 --> 00:41:13,984
He needs to get

694
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:15,776
Get out of this interview in this next

695
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:22,944
Eugene

696
00:41:38,048 --> 00:41:41,120
So essentially what this is is a application of a volume

697
00:41:41,632 --> 00:41:44,960
Is Hillary Clinton

698
00:41:45,216 --> 00:41:48,288
Yeah and she voted for a pay raise for the Secretary of State

699
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:54,687
Call me before she becomes

700
00:41:54,943 --> 00:41:57,759
Secretary of State because there's a conflict there

701
00:41:58,015 --> 00:41:59,551
In voting for raising

702
00:41:59,807 --> 00:42:02,623
Salary they lower the salary back down

703
00:42:02,879 --> 00:42:05,183
To what would have been before

704
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:09,791
Benefiting from

705
00:42:10,047 --> 00:42:11,583
Haven't voted for a pay raise

706
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:12,351
But this

707
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:15,167
Is unsatisfying for Alex he believes

708
00:42:15,423 --> 00:42:21,567
But they're still in the emoluments argument

709
00:42:25,407 --> 00:42:30,015
I understand that even then

710
00:42:30,271 --> 00:42:31,807
That's such a symbolic

711
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:33,599
Sure as well right

712
00:42:33,855 --> 00:42:37,951
Oh we were going to give the Secretary of State a pay raise but because

713
00:42:38,207 --> 00:42:40,255
If you accidentally voted for it

714
00:42:40,511 --> 00:42:41,023
You get

715
00:42:41,279 --> 00:42:42,047
20 grand last

716
00:42:42,303 --> 00:42:48,447
Has any expectation

717
00:42:48,703 --> 00:42:54,847
Here I will be Secretary of State principal for trying to become president

718
00:42:55,103 --> 00:42:56,383
Yeah exactly exactly

719
00:42:56,639 --> 00:42:57,663
That wouldn't have helped

720
00:42:57,919 --> 00:42:58,687
It all

721
00:42:59,199 --> 00:42:59,711
Maybe she could

722
00:42:59,967 --> 00:43:00,479
Giving Obama

723
00:43:00,735 --> 00:43:03,807
The appointment

724
00:43:04,063 --> 00:43:06,623
Maybe maybe a little bit

725
00:43:07,135 --> 00:43:07,903
I don't know

726
00:43:08,927 --> 00:43:09,439
Look

727
00:43:09,695 --> 00:43:11,999
The issue that we come away with this like

728
00:43:12,511 --> 00:43:13,279
The real fun is

729
00:43:13,791 --> 00:43:15,071
Like in present-day theme

730
00:43:15,327 --> 00:43:21,471
Massive emoluments problems that we have with before he actually took off

731
00:43:21,727 --> 00:43:23,775
Never brought up any of that

732
00:43:24,031 --> 00:43:24,543
Stupid all this

733
00:43:24,799 --> 00:43:25,311
Dante

734
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:28,383
Does butthurt liberals complaining about tonight

735
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:30,175
And now we see in 2009

736
00:43:31,711 --> 00:43:33,503
After Obama's become president

737
00:43:33,759 --> 00:43:34,271
He is

738
00:43:34,527 --> 00:43:35,807
Doing this week s***

739
00:43:36,063 --> 00:43:38,623
About Hillary Clinton being made Secretary of State

740
00:43:38,879 --> 00:43:40,159
There's two things one

741
00:43:40,415 --> 00:43:40,927
That's fun

742
00:43:42,207 --> 00:43:43,487
Hillary Clinton's and play

743
00:43:43,743 --> 00:43:46,815
That means Larry Nichols is probably around the corner

744
00:43:47,071 --> 00:43:50,143
I haven't heard him yet I do alright

745
00:43:50,399 --> 00:43:56,543
And whenever Hillary comes around Larry Nichols is not far behind

746
00:43:56,799 --> 00:43:58,079
Going to see some 2009 nickel

747
00:43:58,335 --> 00:44:01,151
Hypocrisy meme

748
00:44:02,175 --> 00:44:02,687
NOCO

749
00:44:05,503 --> 00:44:06,271
No I know

750
00:44:06,783 --> 00:44:12,927
I'm just I'm just I'm just tired of it how long how long did we

751
00:44:13,183 --> 00:44:14,719
The-daily-show-with-jon-stewart

752
00:44:14,975 --> 00:44:16,255
Side-by-side clips of

753
00:44:16,511 --> 00:44:17,791
People saying the exact

754
00:44:18,559 --> 00:44:19,327
And it didn't do any

755
00:44:19,583 --> 00:44:22,655
Would you rather than

756
00:44:22,911 --> 00:44:24,447
Like would you rather that not

757
00:44:24,959 --> 00:44:25,471
What happened

758
00:44:27,263 --> 00:44:30,335
Right I don't know this point I don't f****** know if there is a

759
00:44:30,591 --> 00:44:31,103
World

760
00:44:31,615 --> 00:44:33,919
Like I don't even know what my ideal world is

761
00:44:34,943 --> 00:44:35,455
Like I don't even

762
00:44:35,967 --> 00:44:42,111
Here's my ideal World transition to make this argument ucla.law

763
00:44:42,367 --> 00:44:44,415
Professor

764
00:44:44,671 --> 00:44:45,183
Not agree

765
00:44:52,351 --> 00:44:54,399
Violated here here either

766
00:44:54,911 --> 00:44:56,447
That it's not like

767
00:44:56,703 --> 00:44:58,751
Senator Clinton is getting any extra money

768
00:44:59,007 --> 00:45:02,335
In her pocket because of the rain

769
00:45:02,591 --> 00:45:05,151
Diminution

770
00:45:05,407 --> 00:45:08,223
When she was about to be appointed

771
00:45:08,735 --> 00:45:09,503
So they're like

772
00:45:09,759 --> 00:45:13,343
We got it we got it

773
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:17,951
The lawyer has gone native on Rogue

774
00:45:18,207 --> 00:45:19,743
Bagua with lawyers

775
00:45:20,255 --> 00:45:22,815
They go to break and then come back

776
00:45:28,447 --> 00:45:29,983
Republican

777
00:45:30,239 --> 00:45:31,775
Democrats have generally taken

778
00:45:33,567 --> 00:45:34,847
So long as when the

779
00:45:35,103 --> 00:45:35,615
The person

780
00:45:35,871 --> 00:45:37,151
Enters the office

781
00:45:37,407 --> 00:45:40,991
The salary is no more than what it was with the start of the Senator's term

782
00:45:41,503 --> 00:45:42,271
Call Dad

783
00:45:43,295 --> 00:45:45,343
And I think that President should have some weight

784
00:45:46,367 --> 00:45:52,511
What was the

785
00:45:52,767 --> 00:45:54,303
Brownie

786
00:45:54,559 --> 00:45:57,375
Well I think that's right but I am unaware of any

787
00:45:57,631 --> 00:45:59,167
Venereal pasta

788
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:03,263
Upright law

789
00:46:03,519 --> 00:46:05,311
85 and everybody said no no no

790
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:07,359
So he's arguably Galaxy's

791
00:46:08,639 --> 00:46:09,663
Such a bad guy

792
00:46:12,991 --> 00:46:16,831
Well hold on

793
00:46:18,623 --> 00:46:19,903
What

794
00:46:21,439 --> 00:46:25,279
Do what what did they give you more slaves

795
00:46:25,535 --> 00:46:31,679
Yeah what the president There is close to the original intent of the founders

796
00:46:32,959 --> 00:46:37,567
Who didn't want blacks to vote slavery

797
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:40,895
So Alex is having a real tough time with you

798
00:46:41,407 --> 00:46:42,431
Yeah cuz he's like

799
00:46:42,687 --> 00:46:48,831
Who's the lawyer professionally good

800
00:46:49,343 --> 00:46:53,183
The letter of the law violated violation in

801
00:46:53,439 --> 00:46:55,487
Historically Republicans and Democrats

802
00:46:55,743 --> 00:46:57,279
Agree that this is a way of resolving it

803
00:46:57,535 --> 00:47:02,399
70 Years lyrics

804
00:47:07,775 --> 00:47:09,311
The situation was

805
00:47:09,823 --> 00:47:10,847
They wanted Bork

806
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:12,639
Be in the Supreme Court

807
00:47:12,895 --> 00:47:15,455
They wanted pork in the outfit you got shot down

808
00:47:15,711 --> 00:47:20,063
Their second-place guy was like he had a conflict of interest

809
00:47:20,319 --> 00:47:21,087
Whatever

810
00:47:26,207 --> 00:47:27,231
I'm not doing well here

811
00:47:27,487 --> 00:47:28,255
I got to shift

812
00:47:28,767 --> 00:47:31,839
So as we've heard in 2009 one of his favorite things

813
00:47:32,351 --> 00:47:34,399
Complain about is this LA Times story

814
00:47:34,655 --> 00:47:35,935
Where a lady was on a plane

815
00:47:36,703 --> 00:47:39,775
She spilled a bloody Mary and that she got arrested for terrorism

816
00:47:42,079 --> 00:47:42,847
He's talking to a lawyer

817
00:47:43,615 --> 00:47:45,663
And

818
00:47:47,711 --> 00:47:53,855
Talking about the thing is this is this is Alex's issue

819
00:47:54,111 --> 00:47:58,207
She is so little control

820
00:47:58,463 --> 00:47:59,999
Exposed over and over again like either

821
00:48:00,255 --> 00:48:04,863
Boson that argument about Hillary Clinton but you got nothing here this is really weak

822
00:48:05,375 --> 00:48:09,983
His world

823
00:48:10,239 --> 00:48:12,543
I just want to be super clear about this

824
00:48:12,799 --> 00:48:14,079
Cuz you can go you can listen to

825
00:48:14,335 --> 00:48:15,103
Reposado

826
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:18,943
Find it I don't want to misrepresent what is actually happening

827
00:48:19,199 --> 00:48:21,759
The lawyer himself does day like

828
00:48:22,271 --> 00:48:28,415
I can you know I understand the people might have a different view on this and they can make that argument but I disagree

829
00:48:28,671 --> 00:48:30,975
He's making his argument at being

830
00:48:31,487 --> 00:48:33,279
Pretty polite to the idea that like

831
00:48:33,791 --> 00:48:36,607
People like Judicial Watch

832
00:48:36,863 --> 00:48:38,911
I don't know I'd like to see their

833
00:48:39,167 --> 00:48:44,031
Yeah I got a lot but if you disagree

834
00:48:44,287 --> 00:48:45,311
Historically

835
00:48:45,567 --> 00:48:46,335
Yxy

836
00:48:46,591 --> 00:48:50,175
I feel like I just want to be clear cuz I feel like I misspoke a little bit there

837
00:48:50,431 --> 00:48:53,503
I'm like I'm paying to get like he's dancing on Alex

838
00:49:01,951 --> 00:49:03,487
I would love to see your

839
00:49:03,999 --> 00:49:04,767
That means

840
00:49:05,023 --> 00:49:06,047
He knows your argument is

841
00:49:08,863 --> 00:49:09,375
You're right

842
00:49:09,631 --> 00:49:10,655
Yeah stupid

843
00:49:11,167 --> 00:49:12,959
Yeah they get into that LA Times

844
00:49:13,215 --> 00:49:15,519
Alex brings it up before commercial break

845
00:49:16,543 --> 00:49:17,567
Because that means

846
00:49:17,823 --> 00:49:18,847
This guy's got 4 minutes

847
00:49:19,103 --> 00:49:21,919
That's not good

848
00:49:22,175 --> 00:49:23,199
Okay

849
00:49:26,527 --> 00:49:28,319
But I do know who spent a lot of coverage

850
00:49:28,575 --> 00:49:32,671
Commercial break I actually looked up a case which I think you're referring to

851
00:49:32,927 --> 00:49:33,951
Jelly time story

852
00:49:34,207 --> 00:49:37,535
About Tamara Jo Freeman

853
00:49:38,047 --> 00:49:39,071
It turns out

854
00:49:39,327 --> 00:49:40,607
He was not prosecuted

855
00:49:40,863 --> 00:49:41,887
Intersection 8802

856
00:49:43,423 --> 00:49:44,191
Plead guilty

857
00:49:44,703 --> 00:49:46,495
To violating a pre-existing

858
00:49:46,751 --> 00:49:48,543
Infected 4249 us

859
00:49:48,799 --> 00:49:50,335
C-section for 6504

860
00:49:50,591 --> 00:49:53,151
Which is interference with flight crew members in attendance

861
00:49:53,407 --> 00:49:53,919
Which sounds like

862
00:49:56,735 --> 00:49:58,783
It is true the Patriot Act

863
00:49:59,039 --> 00:50:05,183
The Patriot Act

864
00:50:10,047 --> 00:50:11,839
Turn off light.

865
00:50:12,095 --> 00:50:12,863
Conspiracy

866
00:50:20,543 --> 00:50:26,687
Yes in fact actually I was reading some comments by a lawyer I know who is this

867
00:50:30,271 --> 00:50:36,415
If you want you can find them at the plea agreement in which he describes what's going on and what's the strategy

868
00:50:39,487 --> 00:50:45,375
The Patriot Act

869
00:50:52,031 --> 00:50:54,335
The flight attendant

870
00:50:54,591 --> 00:51:00,223
Farmington

871
00:51:01,503 --> 00:51:03,807
So Alex is

872
00:51:05,087 --> 00:51:07,135
All good

873
00:51:07,391 --> 00:51:13,535
So long since we've had anybody

874
00:51:13,791 --> 00:51:14,303
No this is

875
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:17,887
Legit

876
00:51:18,143 --> 00:51:19,423
Started jerking off a little bit

877
00:51:22,239 --> 00:51:24,799
It's so moment-to-moment

878
00:51:25,055 --> 00:51:29,407
He said the moment the guy said it's all over again

879
00:51:29,663 --> 00:51:32,735
I actually had time to read this article Alex

880
00:51:35,551 --> 00:51:39,391
I've made a huge mistake

881
00:51:39,647 --> 00:51:40,415
Terrible idea

882
00:51:40,671 --> 00:51:44,767
But see that's what and I think that this is really interesting that if you if you take

883
00:51:45,023 --> 00:51:46,303
An external View

884
00:51:47,583 --> 00:51:49,375
The entire situation

885
00:51:49,631 --> 00:51:50,911
You disabuse yourself of

886
00:51:51,679 --> 00:51:52,959
Caring about what's happening

887
00:51:53,215 --> 00:51:54,239
And you look at it like

888
00:51:54,495 --> 00:51:55,775
Oh this is why Alec

889
00:51:56,031 --> 00:51:58,335
What does 345 minutes

890
00:51:58,591 --> 00:51:59,359
Demon impression

891
00:51:59,871 --> 00:52:00,895
It's because he needs

892
00:52:01,151 --> 00:52:04,735
To do that in order to get enough people on his side that don't pay attention

893
00:52:05,247 --> 00:52:07,039
To the fact that this lawyer is just picking apart

894
00:52:07,295 --> 00:52:08,319
His narrative

895
00:52:08,575 --> 00:52:11,391
Well know that wasn't

896
00:52:11,647 --> 00:52:14,207
Tomato to the Patriot Act

897
00:52:14,463 --> 00:52:17,279
And it's really not it it's an issue where

898
00:52:17,791 --> 00:52:18,303
Pleaded guilty

899
00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:21,375
T2 interfering with flight staff

900
00:52:21,887 --> 00:52:23,167
And the only way that that is

901
00:52:23,423 --> 00:52:24,959
Punched it all by Patriot Act

902
00:52:25,215 --> 00:52:26,239
Dude's pants definition

903
00:52:26,495 --> 00:52:27,007
From

904
00:52:27,263 --> 00:52:28,031
Actually interfering

905
00:52:28,287 --> 00:52:31,871
Two including alright conspiring attending

906
00:52:32,127 --> 00:52:38,271
To do it

907
00:52:38,783 --> 00:52:42,111
Yeah murder is bad but also attempted murder is bad

908
00:52:42,367 --> 00:52:45,439
100

909
00:52:45,695 --> 00:52:47,231
If the Patriot Act change

910
00:52:47,743 --> 00:52:48,511
Just murdered

911
00:52:48,767 --> 00:52:51,327
Two attempted murder is also let's throw that in the law

912
00:52:51,583 --> 00:52:52,863
Illegal to

913
00:52:53,119 --> 00:52:54,399
I don't think you have a really

914
00:52:57,471 --> 00:52:59,007
Okay cool there's other things

915
00:53:01,823 --> 00:53:02,847
Complains about the stuff that's

916
00:53:03,359 --> 00:53:03,871
Softest

917
00:53:04,127 --> 00:53:04,639
And weakest

918
00:53:04,895 --> 00:53:08,223
And the part that even I as a dyed-in-the-wool liberal

919
00:53:08,479 --> 00:53:09,247
Do not like

920
00:53:09,759 --> 00:53:10,783
I don't have a problem with that

921
00:53:11,039 --> 00:53:12,831
Like the idea of changing it from

922
00:53:13,087 --> 00:53:16,415
Well I mean I just seen Cody obscurity of someone up

923
00:53:16,671 --> 00:53:17,183
Sprint ant

924
00:53:17,439 --> 00:53:17,951
10 conspiracy

925
00:53:18,207 --> 00:53:24,351
And stuff like that

926
00:53:24,607 --> 00:53:25,119
To like

927
00:53:25,887 --> 00:53:26,655
Kill a stewardess

928
00:53:26,911 --> 00:53:27,679
4 something

929
00:53:27,935 --> 00:53:30,751
You probably counts I guess I'll probably fall under Murder

930
00:53:31,007 --> 00:53:36,639
Let's not get bogged down in this because what happened

931
00:53:36,895 --> 00:53:37,407
Alex

932
00:53:38,175 --> 00:53:38,687
Really sick

933
00:53:39,199 --> 00:53:40,479
And reflect on it and then

934
00:53:40,735 --> 00:53:41,247
How did it go

935
00:53:41,503 --> 00:53:42,015
He's like

936
00:53:42,271 --> 00:53:43,551
Begets to B and reflects

937
00:53:43,807 --> 00:53:47,135
So we know that Alex except that his argument is wheat

938
00:53:47,647 --> 00:53:50,463
And then he decides that yes this law professor

939
00:53:50,719 --> 00:53:51,999
Has a point in eye

940
00:53:52,255 --> 00:53:58,399
No synthesize this information further on in my life

941
00:53:58,655 --> 00:53:59,679
Sits around is like a

942
00:53:59,935 --> 00:54:00,447
Think I wasn't

943
00:54:07,871 --> 00:54:10,943
Reasonable

944
00:54:18,623 --> 00:54:19,903
Admiralty

945
00:54:20,159 --> 00:54:21,951
Sovereign citizen on the lion

946
00:54:22,975 --> 00:54:24,511
Constitution

947
00:54:25,023 --> 00:54:26,047
I love it I love it

948
00:54:26,815 --> 00:54:27,839
So damn much

949
00:54:28,095 --> 00:54:28,607
I love it

950
00:54:39,103 --> 00:54:40,383
Good person I would never

951
00:54:40,639 --> 00:54:41,919
Do that

952
00:54:42,175 --> 00:54:43,455
It's just a

953
00:54:43,711 --> 00:54:44,223
It's just beer.

954
00:54:44,735 --> 00:54:48,575
Erica Hill

955
00:54:50,367 --> 00:54:51,391
What channel

956
00:54:52,927 --> 00:54:54,463
Suggest

957
00:54:55,743 --> 00:54:57,535
In order to put some

958
00:54:57,791 --> 00:55:03,935
He's got to reflect on other guests

959
00:55:04,191 --> 00:55:04,959
But he does like

960
00:55:05,471 --> 00:55:09,055
Such as

961
00:55:09,311 --> 00:55:14,687
Okay

962
00:55:19,551 --> 00:55:21,855
I got call Aaron and

963
00:55:22,111 --> 00:55:23,647
Hundreds of thousands

964
00:55:34,399 --> 00:55:37,983
Aw

965
00:55:55,135 --> 00:55:58,207
Spoiler alert

966
00:55:59,231 --> 00:56:02,303
Car wash

967
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:06,143
Beckbro ksr1

968
00:56:06,399 --> 00:56:07,423
3 *

969
00:56:09,215 --> 00:56:12,287
It's one of those things like I get it

970
00:56:12,799 --> 00:56:13,567
You want

971
00:56:13,823 --> 00:56:14,335
To have

972
00:56:14,847 --> 00:56:15,871
Like this person

973
00:56:16,127 --> 00:56:17,151
Bi-Lo

974
00:56:17,407 --> 00:56:19,711
You want whatever they can give you

975
00:56:20,735 --> 00:56:26,879
It would be like Patton coming on our show

976
00:56:27,135 --> 00:56:29,183
Caldwell it's still great I love you

977
00:56:29,439 --> 00:56:31,487
I think you're working on Oswalt

978
00:56:31,743 --> 00:56:34,047
No but that's that's right

979
00:56:34,559 --> 00:56:37,119
Confidently say ksr1

980
00:56:38,911 --> 00:56:44,543
You don't know s*** about who this guy is,

981
00:56:45,055 --> 00:56:46,335
You are a guy who gets

982
00:56:46,591 --> 00:56:47,871
Drunk at listen to the highway

983
00:56:48,383 --> 00:56:52,991
Wrong with not doing anything about Hip Hop

984
00:56:53,247 --> 00:56:54,527
No you don't have to

985
00:56:55,039 --> 00:56:57,087
You know that you shouldn't either

986
00:56:57,343 --> 00:57:02,463
No I think you should you should have at the very least a cursory knowledge

987
00:57:02,719 --> 00:57:03,999
All different types

988
00:57:04,255 --> 00:57:05,023
It would be nice

989
00:57:05,279 --> 00:57:06,047
It would be nice

990
00:57:06,815 --> 00:57:07,327
Isaac

991
00:57:08,863 --> 00:57:09,631
It's not wrong

992
00:57:09,887 --> 00:57:10,655
Did not know things

993
00:57:10,911 --> 00:57:11,423
About

994
00:57:11,679 --> 00:57:13,727
Other musical genres

995
00:57:13,983 --> 00:57:14,751
If if

996
00:57:15,775 --> 00:57:17,311
Ghosting

997
00:57:17,567 --> 00:57:18,335
To your periphery

998
00:57:18,591 --> 00:57:19,359
Did you

999
00:57:20,127 --> 00:57:20,639
Just

1000
00:57:20,895 --> 00:57:22,175
Reflexively reject them

1001
00:57:23,455 --> 00:57:26,015
Or if you pretend you know tons about it

1002
00:57:26,271 --> 00:57:26,783
And you don't

1003
00:57:30,367 --> 00:57:33,439
Willie Nelson

1004
00:57:33,695 --> 00:57:35,743
Waylon Jennings

1005
00:57:35,999 --> 00:57:40,863
When when you start getting into Willie Nelson Waylon Jennings we're in a very different world than

1006
00:57:41,119 --> 00:57:41,887
Big & Rich

1007
00:57:42,399 --> 00:57:46,495
I know but I really was very different world than big and f***

1008
00:57:46,751 --> 00:57:51,359
But I was still a little bit of credit

1009
00:57:51,615 --> 00:57:53,663
What do you know about George Strait

1010
00:57:56,223 --> 00:57:56,735
Snow

1011
00:58:01,855 --> 00:58:06,975
The cursory knowledge of diarist

1012
00:58:09,279 --> 00:58:09,791
Inexplicable

1013
00:58:10,047 --> 00:58:11,327
Loved

1014
00:58:11,583 --> 00:58:13,631
Do you know they have to move refrigerators

1015
00:58:14,399 --> 00:58:15,935
Remove these color TV

1016
00:58:16,447 --> 00:58:17,215
Money for nothing

1017
00:58:17,983 --> 00:58:22,335
Boy that song is really f***** up

1018
00:58:22,591 --> 00:58:24,639
And not f*** it will never

1019
00:58:24,895 --> 00:58:26,175
Ever forget the music

1020
00:58:27,199 --> 00:58:30,015
The block animation will haunt me till I die

1021
00:58:33,855 --> 00:58:34,623
Do the Walk of Life

1022
00:58:34,879 --> 00:58:36,671
Another one

1023
00:58:38,975 --> 00:58:41,279
You don't know s*** about Dire Straits

1024
00:58:41,791 --> 00:58:43,327
George Strait

1025
00:58:43,583 --> 00:58:45,887
You don't have a response

1026
00:58:46,143 --> 00:58:49,215
You have a responsibility to but that Eazy-E

1027
00:58:49,471 --> 00:58:49,983
The world of country

1028
00:58:50,239 --> 00:58:52,543
If we were to have him off the show

1029
00:58:52,799 --> 00:58:54,591
I would probably do a lot more

1030
00:58:55,103 --> 00:58:56,895
Right listen to the best

1031
00:58:57,151 --> 00:58:58,431
Straight you didn't like like

1032
00:58:58,687 --> 00:58:59,967
Amarillo by Morning

1033
00:59:00,223 --> 00:59:02,015
I hate every

1034
00:59:02,271 --> 00:59:03,551
Is big-hit

1035
00:59:04,063 --> 00:59:06,623
Is the one word

1036
00:59:07,135 --> 00:59:09,183
Police

1037
00:59:09,439 --> 00:59:10,719
That that one

1038
00:59:12,767 --> 00:59:18,911
All right if you just reject out-of-hand musical-genre you don't know much about than your kind of an a******

1039
00:59:20,191 --> 00:59:21,215
Alex is not even doing that

1040
00:59:21,727 --> 00:59:26,079
Use the same ksr1 misrepresented in a sycophantic

1041
00:59:26,335 --> 00:59:27,103
At the same time

1042
00:59:27,359 --> 00:59:28,639
Is that the little bit too much

1043
00:59:29,919 --> 00:59:36,063
The only reason I brought up any of that stuff is just I wanted to put I want a picture of your face

1044
00:59:36,319 --> 00:59:37,343
Stars like that's what I'm say

1045
00:59:37,599 --> 00:59:39,391
The only reason I brought it

1046
00:59:39,647 --> 00:59:40,159
On your face that you

1047
00:59:40,671 --> 00:59:43,231
Fake get judgemental about people and I don't know anything about country

1048
00:59:43,487 --> 00:59:44,511
Alright alright

1049
00:59:45,791 --> 00:59:46,815
Alright

1050
00:59:50,911 --> 00:59:57,055
You're just different back to the Britney Spears I give it all over anyway interview earlier

1051
00:59:57,311 --> 00:59:58,335
Did not

1052
00:59:58,591 --> 00:59:59,103
Go Gray

1053
00:59:59,615 --> 01:00:02,687
Clearly never met

1054
01:00:02,943 --> 01:00:03,455
On this episode

1055
01:00:03,711 --> 01:00:04,223
We're not going to listen

1056
01:00:04,735 --> 01:00:08,063
Any of it cuz it doesn't really matter

1057
01:00:08,575 --> 01:00:13,183
Rob this is actually February 4th 2009 is the first meeting of Alex Jones

1058
01:00:13,439 --> 01:00:13,951
Peter Schiff

1059
01:00:14,207 --> 01:00:15,487
Economist

1060
01:00:15,743 --> 01:00:17,791
Austrian School Economist Peter Schiff

1061
01:00:18,047 --> 01:00:20,607
He's on because Ron Paul's out

1062
01:00:20,863 --> 01:00:22,655
Directions for

1063
01:00:22,911 --> 01:00:25,471
Yes this is synchronicity

1064
01:00:25,983 --> 01:00:28,543
Situated I know that they've never spoken before because

1065
01:00:28,799 --> 01:00:30,335
You keep saying Ron Paul's out

1066
01:00:30,591 --> 01:00:32,639
For you it's not like that

1067
01:00:32,895 --> 01:00:34,943
The two of them don't know each other there's no

1068
01:00:35,199 --> 01:00:38,271
Whatsoever

1069
01:00:38,527 --> 01:00:39,039
An hour

1070
01:00:39,295 --> 01:00:40,319
Edit just leave

1071
01:00:40,575 --> 01:00:42,111
To Alex then coming back

1072
01:00:42,367 --> 01:00:42,879
And being like

1073
01:00:43,903 --> 01:00:44,415
Selsun gold

1074
01:00:45,951 --> 01:00:46,975
And so clearly

1075
01:00:47,231 --> 01:00:48,511
He is even aware enough

1076
01:00:50,047 --> 01:00:51,839
Say some scary s*** about the economy

1077
01:00:52,095 --> 01:00:53,631
Yeah

1078
01:00:53,887 --> 01:00:56,959
More like Failure to Launch

1079
01:00:57,471 --> 01:01:03,615
As far as our

1080
01:01:04,127 --> 01:01:08,991
Would that be

1081
01:01:09,247 --> 01:01:11,807
I don't think they don't like each other

1082
01:01:14,367 --> 01:01:16,927
Alright

1083
01:01:17,183 --> 01:01:19,999
Brag

1084
01:01:20,255 --> 01:01:22,303
You think I was literally says to him

1085
01:01:22,559 --> 01:01:24,351
Hey what you tell people what you predicted

1086
01:01:25,631 --> 01:01:26,655
Peter Schiff is like

1087
01:01:27,935 --> 01:01:32,031
No

1088
01:01:32,287 --> 01:01:33,823
There's no there's no snow

1089
01:01:34,079 --> 01:01:34,847
Synchronicity in terms

1090
01:01:35,103 --> 01:01:36,383
Look like

1091
01:01:39,711 --> 01:01:40,223
Everyday

1092
01:01:40,479 --> 01:01:41,503
I think in 2009

1093
01:01:41,759 --> 01:01:42,527
Bob is the

1094
01:01:43,039 --> 01:01:43,551
Preferred

1095
01:01:43,807 --> 01:01:44,319
Guy

1096
01:01:44,575 --> 01:01:45,855
Just set up Ted Anderson

1097
01:01:46,111 --> 01:01:46,879
Gold pictures

1098
01:01:48,415 --> 01:01:49,183
Gabion everyday

1099
01:01:49,439 --> 01:01:54,047
We got to get more people in that in that

1100
01:01:54,303 --> 01:01:54,815
Peter Schiff

1101
01:01:55,327 --> 01:01:58,399
Is someone who Ron Paul his advise like this guy could do the job

1102
01:01:58,655 --> 01:02:00,447
He could do the job for you he loves gold

1103
01:02:00,703 --> 01:02:02,495
We need a Solid 4

1104
01:02:02,751 --> 01:02:03,263
Exactly

1105
01:02:03,519 --> 01:02:07,871
Need a middle Innings Guiles

1106
01:02:08,127 --> 01:02:08,639
Later

1107
01:02:09,151 --> 01:02:10,431
Alex has another guest on that he

1108
01:02:10,687 --> 01:02:11,199
He's never spoken to

1109
01:02:11,455 --> 01:02:11,967
2 / 4

1110
01:02:12,223 --> 01:02:12,991
At this one

1111
01:02:13,759 --> 01:02:14,527
It's also probably

1112
01:02:15,551 --> 01:02:17,855
This is a guy named Peter Wallace

1113
01:02:18,367 --> 01:02:22,207
Who was a lawyer in the Reagan White House

1114
01:02:23,231 --> 01:02:24,255
He is a guy who

1115
01:02:24,511 --> 01:02:25,279
He's been around

1116
01:02:25,535 --> 01:02:26,047
He's been around the block

1117
01:02:30,143 --> 01:02:34,239
People who actually know stuff like that even though he's a lawyer in the Reagan

1118
01:02:35,519 --> 01:02:36,031
You still f******

1119
01:02:36,287 --> 01:02:36,799
Nose

1120
01:02:37,311 --> 01:02:38,591
Yeah like why Alex

1121
01:02:42,431 --> 01:02:42,943
Hubris

1122
01:02:43,455 --> 01:02:45,759
That he has

1123
01:02:46,015 --> 01:02:46,527
Oh

1124
01:02:47,551 --> 01:02:48,319
But

1125
01:02:48,575 --> 01:02:53,951
But a three-headed dog that protects against

1126
01:02:54,207 --> 01:02:54,719
I think it's

1127
01:02:54,975 --> 01:02:57,279
Because he has enough Gaston that like

1128
01:02:58,047 --> 01:03:01,631
Can bend the railroad in a bit

1129
01:03:01,887 --> 01:03:02,399
He thinks

1130
01:03:05,215 --> 01:03:08,799
Or do pick up on like this is what the host

1131
01:03:09,055 --> 01:03:09,823
Wants to happen

1132
01:03:10,079 --> 01:03:13,151
Uncomfortable

1133
01:03:13,919 --> 01:03:15,967
I think he thinks that

1134
01:03:16,991 --> 01:03:18,527
This guy Peter Wallace

1135
01:03:19,039 --> 01:03:19,551
Alex

1136
01:03:19,807 --> 01:03:20,831
I want to talk to him about

1137
01:03:21,343 --> 01:03:23,135
And boy he doesn't agree with Alex

1138
01:03:24,415 --> 01:03:26,975
Now they're open

1139
01:03:31,839 --> 01:03:34,399
Cotton

1140
01:03:34,655 --> 01:03:38,239
Collapse

1141
01:03:39,263 --> 01:03:40,543
Well I don't know

1142
01:03:40,799 --> 01:03:43,359
Anything about any of those things maybe they maybe they are happy

1143
01:03:47,967 --> 01:03:48,479
By the way

1144
01:03:48,735 --> 01:03:54,879
This literally just wrote down this is why

1145
01:03:55,135 --> 01:03:55,647
White voice shed

1146
01:03:56,927 --> 01:03:57,951
Call Dad

1147
01:03:58,463 --> 01:03:59,231
That we could have

1148
01:03:59,487 --> 01:04:00,255
Depression

1149
01:04:00,511 --> 01:04:01,279
That's why

1150
01:04:01,535 --> 01:04:02,559
The government is acting

1151
01:04:03,327 --> 01:04:05,119
In such extraordinary ways

1152
01:04:05,375 --> 01:04:07,167
Why the Federal Federal

1153
01:04:07,423 --> 01:04:07,935
Reservist

1154
01:04:08,191 --> 01:04:10,239
So much for the treasury Department of spending so much

1155
01:04:10,495 --> 01:04:13,567
Crazy trying to avoid the possibility of a recession

1156
01:04:13,823 --> 01:04:14,335
Because

1157
01:04:14,847 --> 01:04:15,359
In the 30s

1158
01:04:16,127 --> 01:04:16,895
The diagnosis

1159
01:04:17,151 --> 01:04:18,687
This has been that the reason

1160
01:04:18,943 --> 01:04:19,711
We had this depression

1161
01:04:19,967 --> 01:04:24,319
In the thirties with that the Federal Reserve did not ask

1162
01:04:24,575 --> 01:04:25,343
Satisfactorily

1163
01:04:25,855 --> 01:04:26,879
As the economy

1164
01:04:27,391 --> 01:04:27,903
Declining

1165
01:04:31,487 --> 01:04:31,999
So

1166
01:04:32,255 --> 01:04:35,071
I think it's I think what they're doing is necessary and I deserve it

1167
01:04:35,839 --> 01:04:36,607
The only reason I told you

1168
01:04:36,863 --> 01:04:37,887
You shut up is like that

1169
01:04:38,143 --> 01:04:41,471
Super important to Alex's

1170
01:04:41,983 --> 01:04:42,751
Tire world

1171
01:04:43,007 --> 01:04:47,359
The Federal Reserve is acting appropriately

1172
01:04:47,615 --> 01:04:49,407
29 stock market crash

1173
01:04:49,663 --> 01:04:50,943
Quit because big did not

1174
01:04:51,455 --> 01:04:51,967
Interact

1175
01:04:52,223 --> 01:04:55,039
They were made to stop

1176
01:04:55,295 --> 01:04:59,903
All these pants were happening in the late 1800s early 1900s

1177
01:05:00,159 --> 01:05:00,927
1807

1178
01:05:01,183 --> 01:05:04,511
View because of

1179
01:05:04,767 --> 01:05:07,583
So much fear of them overstepping their bounds

1180
01:05:07,839 --> 01:05:09,375
We had a terrible

1181
01:05:09,631 --> 01:05:11,679
We had a terrible disaster in the Great Depression

1182
01:05:11,935 --> 01:05:12,959
Yeah because they didn't

1183
01:05:13,471 --> 01:05:14,239
Sprite and

1184
01:05:14,495 --> 01:05:17,567
In 2000 we got a really good example of

1185
01:05:17,823 --> 01:05:18,591
Them

1186
01:05:18,847 --> 01:05:22,431
I'm stopping it from being way worse than it what could have been

1187
01:05:22,687 --> 01:05:23,199
Exact

1188
01:05:23,455 --> 01:05:29,599
Disproportionately because of conservative

1189
01:05:29,855 --> 01:05:31,647
Yeah but that can't put that on Wallace

1190
01:05:31,903 --> 01:05:37,279
This guy is pretty right

1191
01:05:37,535 --> 01:05:43,679
He's nailing and I do love

1192
01:05:46,751 --> 01:05:48,799
Don't know anything about that

1193
01:05:49,055 --> 01:05:49,823
Don't know

1194
01:05:58,271 --> 01:05:59,039
With Eugene's

1195
01:05:59,295 --> 01:06:00,319
When it was like

1196
01:06:00,575 --> 01:06:04,415
I'm trying to talk about this emoluments thing either

1197
01:06:04,671 --> 01:06:09,023
Well let's talk about that

1198
01:06:09,279 --> 01:06:11,327
So now he's like I was like well

1199
01:06:12,095 --> 01:06:13,119
I got to find

1200
01:06:13,375 --> 01:06:13,887
I got to find some

1201
01:06:14,399 --> 01:06:15,935
I got to find something to talk about

1202
01:06:16,191 --> 01:06:17,983
So he brings up another one of his narrative

1203
01:06:19,007 --> 01:06:20,287
Chihuahuas

1204
01:06:21,567 --> 01:06:26,943
You certain

1205
01:06:27,199 --> 01:06:27,967
No

1206
01:06:28,223 --> 01:06:30,015
It's not heard about that

1207
01:06:33,599 --> 01:06:34,367
Delightful

1208
01:06:34,623 --> 01:06:37,695
So there's that all about it all about it

1209
01:06:37,951 --> 01:06:38,719
Alex tries again

1210
01:06:39,487 --> 01:06:43,071
MarketWatch

1211
01:06:48,191 --> 01:06:48,703
Didn't see that

1212
01:06:48,959 --> 01:06:49,983
Did not see that

1213
01:06:51,519 --> 01:06:57,663
Talked about on the upstairs light

1214
01:06:57,919 --> 01:06:58,431
To be like

1215
01:06:58,943 --> 01:06:59,455
Jimmy

1216
01:06:59,711 --> 01:07:00,735
Then what

1217
01:07:00,991 --> 01:07:02,015
Give me something

1218
01:07:02,271 --> 01:07:08,415
What it's like to be you know like maybe you're on a bed date

1219
01:07:08,671 --> 01:07:09,439
You met online

1220
01:07:10,719 --> 01:07:13,023
Tender or some sort of like

1221
01:07:13,535 --> 01:07:18,143
You don't know much about each other and you're sitting there on the date and I like actually don't like sex

1222
01:07:19,935 --> 01:07:23,263
You like oral

1223
01:07:23,519 --> 01:07:25,567
Mutual masturbation does that work for you

1224
01:07:26,079 --> 01:07:29,151
Never heard of it I got to go

1225
01:07:29,407 --> 01:07:33,247
That's kind of what's happening it's like the f******

1226
01:07:33,503 --> 01:07:39,647
First down

1227
01:07:39,903 --> 01:07:46,047
He's negotiating down to that lady at the North American Union

1228
01:07:46,303 --> 01:07:52,447
I have not heard about that that sounds crazy okay

1229
01:07:52,959 --> 01:07:55,263
As a as a response to Alex

1230
01:07:59,359 --> 01:08:00,127
I don't know

1231
01:08:00,639 --> 01:08:04,479
The f*** are you talking about

1232
01:08:04,735 --> 01:08:10,623
Lawyer whatever the

1233
01:08:10,879 --> 01:08:13,183
I'll be clear about it there interview goes much longer than

1234
01:08:13,439 --> 01:08:15,231
But it doesn't really has much more subs

1235
01:08:16,511 --> 01:08:17,279
It's more

1236
01:08:17,535 --> 01:08:19,071
It's more of like Bruce

1237
01:08:19,583 --> 01:08:20,351
Alright

1238
01:08:20,607 --> 01:08:21,375
I'm going well

1239
01:08:23,167 --> 01:08:26,239
Peter Schiff but that one's just

1240
01:08:27,007 --> 01:08:28,543
It is what it is

1241
01:08:28,799 --> 01:08:30,335
Do you have this

1242
01:08:30,591 --> 01:08:32,127
This first interview with Eugene

1243
01:08:33,919 --> 01:08:34,943
And then afterwards I was like

1244
01:08:35,199 --> 01:08:41,343
American lawyer in here agree with me

1245
01:08:41,599 --> 01:08:44,671
Here is what he says after this

1246
01:08:45,695 --> 01:08:49,535
But I feel like I feel like he's a loser

1247
01:08:49,791 --> 01:08:50,303
Yeah

1248
01:08:53,375 --> 01:08:56,959
We had

1249
01:08:57,215 --> 01:09:03,359
We need him Haiti's if he's got the ear of many people

1250
01:09:03,615 --> 01:09:07,199
Voice caller

1251
01:09:07,455 --> 01:09:13,087
Caller

1252
01:09:13,343 --> 01:09:15,135
Cardigan

1253
01:09:15,391 --> 01:09:16,159
Where he's like

1254
01:09:16,415 --> 01:09:18,975
Alex

1255
01:09:19,231 --> 01:09:19,743
Alex

1256
01:09:19,999 --> 01:09:20,767
We need him

1257
01:09:21,023 --> 01:09:22,815
We need him for that.

1258
01:09:23,071 --> 01:09:23,839
Could you not be a bit

1259
01:09:27,423 --> 01:09:27,935
I think it's

1260
01:09:28,191 --> 01:09:28,703
Interesting

1261
01:09:28,959 --> 01:09:29,727
Angle to take

1262
01:09:39,967 --> 01:09:44,319
Washington d.c. if we could get him listen to Infowars for a week

1263
01:09:44,575 --> 01:09:49,695
Hey babe brought up to speed immediately think I was in

1264
01:09:57,119 --> 01:09:58,911
Anyway we're now moving on to February 5th

1265
01:09:59,167 --> 01:10:01,471
Alright

1266
01:10:04,031 --> 01:10:04,799
Real bad

1267
01:10:05,055 --> 01:10:06,847
Real bat

1268
01:10:07,359 --> 01:10:09,151
Alex starts

1269
01:10:09,407 --> 01:10:10,431
Additional

1270
01:10:10,943 --> 01:10:12,479
Two weeks into Obama's birth

1271
01:10:13,759 --> 01:10:15,295
And now two weeks in a day

1272
01:10:17,087 --> 01:10:19,135
Starting off

1273
01:10:19,647 --> 01:10:20,415
You show here on the 5th

1274
01:10:20,927 --> 01:10:22,975
By complaining about Al Gore

1275
01:10:23,231 --> 01:10:23,999
Yeah and then

1276
01:10:24,511 --> 01:10:25,023
Sing

1277
01:10:25,279 --> 01:10:26,559
Some weird stuff

1278
01:10:27,327 --> 01:10:30,911
There is all kinds of about

1279
01:10:31,167 --> 01:10:32,191
Hit the more popular version

1280
01:10:42,687 --> 01:10:45,759
Put him in jail

1281
01:10:46,527 --> 01:10:50,879
The state knows best

1282
01:10:52,927 --> 01:10:56,511
Background on all of this

1283
01:11:13,663 --> 01:11:15,455
Sure

1284
01:11:19,807 --> 01:11:25,439
It seems like that all over again

1285
01:11:25,695 --> 01:11:26,975
Listen to where it goes

1286
01:11:33,631 --> 01:11:38,495
Establishment

1287
01:11:38,751 --> 01:11:40,287
No

1288
01:11:48,479 --> 01:11:52,063
Right

1289
01:12:03,583 --> 01:12:04,095
Okay

1290
01:12:04,607 --> 01:12:05,887
I'll agree with the last

1291
01:12:06,143 --> 01:12:06,655
Couple words

1292
01:12:13,311 --> 01:12:15,871
No I know that's what's fascinated

1293
01:12:16,127 --> 01:12:17,407
It's surprising

1294
01:12:17,663 --> 01:12:18,431
Invest

1295
01:12:18,943 --> 01:12:19,967
Right at the rise of

1296
01:12:20,223 --> 01:12:20,735
The Tea Party

1297
01:12:21,247 --> 01:12:22,783
February 2009

1298
01:12:23,551 --> 01:12:24,575
It's really interesting

1299
01:12:25,087 --> 01:12:25,599
If that level of

1300
01:12:25,855 --> 01:12:26,623
Insight from Alex

1301
01:12:26,879 --> 01:12:27,647
Because I think he's totally

1302
01:12:30,207 --> 01:12:31,231
Absolutely not

1303
01:12:31,487 --> 01:12:34,815
In terms of the New World Order existing or anything like that

1304
01:12:35,071 --> 01:12:35,839
Stuff is a little bit

1305
01:12:36,351 --> 01:12:38,655
Stupid ideas

1306
01:12:39,167 --> 01:12:41,471
He's saying a lot of stuff that is attractive

1307
01:12:41,727 --> 01:12:43,007
Two people who follow me

1308
01:12:43,263 --> 01:12:45,567
He's trying to seduce you into that line

1309
01:12:46,079 --> 01:12:46,847
Because

1310
01:12:47,359 --> 01:12:51,199
He's got these people behind him if you just replace the New World Order in that with

1311
01:12:51,455 --> 01:12:51,967
The coax

1312
01:12:52,223 --> 01:12:56,575
You have exactly like his assessment is right on

1313
01:12:56,831 --> 01:12:57,855
Yeah but

1314
01:12:58,111 --> 01:12:58,623
I think that he has

1315
01:13:01,439 --> 01:13:01,951
Hughes

1316
01:13:02,463 --> 01:13:03,487
This is free

1317
01:13:03,999 --> 01:13:05,023
Whatever changes

1318
01:13:06,047 --> 01:13:06,815
Because he still hasn't

1319
01:13:07,071 --> 01:13:08,095
I mean you look up on the board

1320
01:13:08,607 --> 01:13:10,399
He still hasn't abandoned

1321
01:13:10,655 --> 01:13:12,959
He hasn't changed his positions on these

1322
01:13:13,215 --> 01:13:15,007
Very foundational thing right

1323
01:13:15,263 --> 01:13:18,591
I know this because it just seemed redundant

1324
01:13:18,847 --> 01:13:21,151
Clip-on one of these episodes he's like

1325
01:13:21,919 --> 01:13:24,991
Slavery just became big going to prison

1326
01:13:25,247 --> 01:13:27,807
You nailed it

1327
01:13:29,855 --> 01:13:33,183
You get paid $2 an hour that's pretty much labor

1328
01:13:34,207 --> 01:13:39,327
To hear this is back when Alex is what you would call

1329
01:13:39,583 --> 01:13:41,119
Crazy as opposed to Craven

1330
01:13:42,399 --> 01:13:43,679
Like generally speaking

1331
01:13:43,935 --> 01:13:50,079
No I am not saying that it's crazy to have a beer cuz I'm thinking about going crazy

1332
01:13:51,359 --> 01:13:55,967
Prison is just slavery but currently like the the use of the lizard voice

1333
01:13:56,479 --> 01:13:56,991
That's bulshit

1334
01:14:00,063 --> 01:14:01,087
History of prison

1335
01:14:02,111 --> 01:14:08,255
I agree with you

1336
01:14:08,511 --> 01:14:10,047
Arguing when he makes a good point

1337
01:14:10,559 --> 01:14:11,839
I'm arguing that

1338
01:14:12,351 --> 01:14:14,399
His his ideology

1339
01:14:14,655 --> 01:14:16,191
Is built out of a cent

1340
01:14:17,215 --> 01:14:17,983
Paranoia

1341
01:14:19,775 --> 01:14:20,287
Luna theater

1342
01:14:20,799 --> 01:14:22,335
And occasionally

1343
01:14:22,847 --> 01:14:23,359
Emails

1344
01:14:25,151 --> 01:14:26,431
Whereas now

1345
01:14:26,687 --> 01:14:27,711
It is built out of

1346
01:14:27,967 --> 01:14:28,991
Whatever makes me mad

1347
01:14:35,647 --> 01:14:37,439
Is when did he make that transition

1348
01:14:37,695 --> 01:14:43,839
From what I understand what you're saying

1349
01:14:46,655 --> 01:14:52,799
Because you listen to way more Alex Jones than I do and then you give me a prism to which no but I think you're

1350
01:14:54,079 --> 01:14:59,199
Accurate and I think it's not this time

1351
01:15:03,295 --> 01:15:03,807
It's jealous

1352
01:15:04,319 --> 01:15:05,855
I'm the same way that like

1353
01:15:06,111 --> 01:15:09,951
A couple episodes of Ron Paul went on Glenn Beck's show Alex

1354
01:15:10,207 --> 01:15:10,719
Respond reply

1355
01:15:12,767 --> 01:15:15,839
You don't even like Ron Paul Ron Paul we're Buddies

1356
01:15:16,095 --> 01:15:17,631
I accept

1357
01:15:17,887 --> 01:15:23,775
Far more than my own absolutely correct

1358
01:15:24,031 --> 01:15:25,823
It is accurate analysis

1359
01:15:27,871 --> 01:15:28,895
Adore

1360
01:15:29,151 --> 01:15:35,295
The rise of the tea party and we see Ron Paul consistently

1361
01:15:35,551 --> 01:15:36,575
Associated with it

1362
01:15:36,831 --> 01:15:40,927
I think that jealousy is going to grow even more info

1363
01:15:41,183 --> 01:15:42,719
Be what ends up breaking Alex

1364
01:15:42,975 --> 01:15:45,535
I think it's going to be what ends up

1365
01:15:46,303 --> 01:15:47,327
To the point where he's like

1366
01:15:48,095 --> 01:15:48,607
F*** it

1367
01:15:48,863 --> 01:15:49,375
Yeah I'm in

1368
01:15:49,887 --> 01:15:51,423
Let me be the

1369
01:15:51,935 --> 01:15:52,703
Real mouthpiece

1370
01:15:52,959 --> 01:15:56,799
This guy is no good

1371
01:15:57,311 --> 01:16:01,407
It doesn't work

1372
01:16:01,663 --> 01:16:04,735
The money behind it needs a new mouthpiece because Glenn Beck

1373
01:16:05,247 --> 01:16:06,271
So sullied

1374
01:16:06,527 --> 01:16:08,319
Doubt in the mainstream

1375
01:16:08,575 --> 01:16:09,343
I think you're going to

1376
01:16:09,599 --> 01:16:10,111
To end up with

1377
01:16:11,647 --> 01:16:16,767
Alright completely retracting argument

1378
01:16:17,023 --> 01:16:20,351
Now please retract your argument about Britney Spears

1379
01:16:20,863 --> 01:16:23,423
And then immediate - 12

1380
01:16:23,679 --> 01:16:24,191
To Britney Spears

1381
01:16:24,447 --> 01:16:24,959
Certain

1382
01:16:25,215 --> 01:16:25,727
This isn't true

1383
01:16:25,983 --> 01:16:27,007
Honor last episode

1384
01:16:27,263 --> 01:16:28,287
We talked about

1385
01:16:29,823 --> 01:16:30,591
Alex Jones's

1386
01:16:31,103 --> 01:16:31,871
Market

1387
01:16:32,639 --> 01:16:33,919
Ability to breakdown adver

1388
01:16:34,431 --> 01:16:36,735
Yes he's amazing insight

1389
01:16:36,991 --> 01:16:39,039
M2 Super Bowl commercials

1390
01:16:39,295 --> 01:16:41,599
Because we know we know

1391
01:16:42,111 --> 01:16:44,159
He took advertising classes

1392
01:16:44,415 --> 01:16:47,743
Hold on

1393
01:16:47,999 --> 01:16:51,071
He actually never said classes

1394
01:16:51,327 --> 01:16:52,095
I took Alberta

1395
01:16:52,863 --> 01:16:54,399
Edit psych Warfare

1396
01:16:54,655 --> 01:16:57,983
That there is a corn syrup commercial with a popsicle

1397
01:16:58,495 --> 01:17:00,287
Sex

1398
01:17:00,543 --> 01:17:01,567
Sex

1399
01:17:02,079 --> 01:17:03,359
Was

1400
01:17:03,615 --> 01:17:06,175
No

1401
01:17:06,687 --> 01:17:07,711
When did Batman

1402
01:17:11,807 --> 01:17:12,575
Yeah but

1403
01:17:12,831 --> 01:17:16,415
Naruto videos like 16

1404
01:17:19,487 --> 01:17:19,999
7 years

1405
01:17:20,511 --> 01:17:26,655
I don't know 2009

1406
01:17:26,911 --> 01:17:28,959
Shockingly close to when I move to Chicago

1407
01:17:29,471 --> 01:17:31,263
All right so because

1408
01:17:32,543 --> 01:17:36,895
Cuz I watch one episode

1409
01:17:37,151 --> 01:17:40,223
No I don't know but I don't I don't think matters

1410
01:17:40,735 --> 01:17:46,111
I will say if it is on

1411
01:17:46,367 --> 01:17:50,207
The only episode that aired is that one with the carousel

1412
01:17:54,047 --> 01:17:57,119
I could be your through Higher lyrics

1413
01:17:57,375 --> 01:18:00,191
I have no idea that show sucks

1414
01:18:00,959 --> 01:18:02,495
Y'all god dammit

1415
01:18:02,751 --> 01:18:03,775
This is Britney Spears all over

1416
01:18:04,287 --> 01:18:05,823
Premier 2000

1417
01:18:08,383 --> 01:18:08,895
Alright

1418
01:18:10,687 --> 01:18:11,711
Anyway

1419
01:18:11,967 --> 01:18:12,991
So the reason I brought up

1420
01:18:13,503 --> 01:18:14,015
That corn syrup

1421
01:18:14,271 --> 01:18:15,551
Is because

1422
01:18:15,807 --> 01:18:16,319
Alex

1423
01:18:17,855 --> 01:18:18,367
Clip

1424
01:18:18,879 --> 01:18:19,647
Brings that

1425
01:18:20,159 --> 01:18:20,671
Go to backup

1426
01:18:20,927 --> 01:18:22,207
Not his analysis of

1427
01:18:22,463 --> 01:18:24,511
The commercial

1428
01:18:25,023 --> 01:18:27,839
And it also made me realize

1429
01:18:29,375 --> 01:18:30,399
F****** miserable

1430
01:18:31,167 --> 01:18:31,935
I didn't

1431
01:18:32,191 --> 01:18:32,703
Realize

1432
01:18:33,727 --> 01:18:35,519
Did people live next door to him

1433
01:18:36,543 --> 01:18:38,591
I just left the studio or his house

1434
01:18:38,847 --> 01:18:40,639
His house

1435
01:18:41,151 --> 01:18:42,431
Yeah I never thought about like

1436
01:18:42,687 --> 01:18:43,199
Oh

1437
01:18:43,455 --> 01:18:43,967
Alex husband

1438
01:18:44,991 --> 01:18:46,015
It turns out he has

1439
01:18:47,295 --> 01:18:52,927
I was talking to somebody on my front lawn this morning and they were

1440
01:19:01,119 --> 01:19:03,167
Your

1441
01:19:15,711 --> 01:19:19,039
Mediterranean food

1442
01:19:26,719 --> 01:19:27,487
Can't wait for that

1443
01:19:28,511 --> 01:19:31,583
When your when your neighbors stop giggling at you and talk

1444
01:19:31,839 --> 01:19:33,887
It's because they talked to you a couple times.

1445
01:19:34,143 --> 01:19:35,679
No no

1446
01:19:36,191 --> 01:19:36,959
Not a big fan

1447
01:19:39,263 --> 01:19:43,103
I'm going to

1448
01:19:44,127 --> 01:19:48,991
Like I actually think I know I think I've seen the house

1449
01:19:51,807 --> 01:19:53,599
What's online

1450
01:19:54,367 --> 01:19:56,159
I see that pretty nice

1451
01:19:56,671 --> 01:20:02,815
Cuz you lose in nice houses in both of us like to do even if 2009

1452
01:20:03,071 --> 01:20:04,095
Suburban like

1453
01:20:04,351 --> 01:20:05,119
Lawn like

1454
01:20:05,375 --> 01:20:07,167
Everybody's house looks

1455
01:20:07,423 --> 01:20:09,983
The same like I see that settlement kind of

1456
01:20:10,239 --> 01:20:13,055
Feel 280 out out on your lawn

1457
01:20:13,824 --> 01:20:14,848
And people talk to you

1458
01:20:15,616 --> 01:20:18,944
It has to have that feel of like you got the

1459
01:20:19,200 --> 01:20:19,968
Driveway

1460
01:20:21,248 --> 01:20:23,040
You got the lawn that you have to

1461
01:20:23,296 --> 01:20:24,576
Every now and again

1462
01:20:24,832 --> 01:20:25,856
Like that's what I see

1463
01:20:26,112 --> 01:20:27,648
We're paying neighborhood kid to mow

1464
01:20:27,904 --> 01:20:28,416
Exact

1465
01:20:29,184 --> 01:20:30,976
I don't know

1466
01:20:34,560 --> 01:20:36,352
I just hunt

1467
01:20:37,632 --> 01:20:38,144
I would

1468
01:20:40,704 --> 01:20:42,752
I like the idea of like when you're growing up

1469
01:20:43,008 --> 01:20:44,288
I think I don't know I don't know if this is

1470
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:46,848
Uno growing up it was always like this

1471
01:20:47,360 --> 01:20:49,408
Archetype of the horrible neighbor was like

1472
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:54,528
Camry won't give it back that was early to punch line of the

1473
01:20:54,784 --> 01:20:58,880
Terrible neighbor

1474
01:20:59,392 --> 01:21:00,160
Let me

1475
01:21:00,416 --> 01:21:02,208
As of now thirty-four-year-old man

1476
01:21:02,976 --> 01:21:04,768
The only thing I don't want

1477
01:21:05,024 --> 01:21:05,536
Is

1478
01:21:06,048 --> 01:21:09,632
Guy who yells about corn syrup

1479
01:21:09,888 --> 01:21:15,264
That's the neighbor I don't want

1480
01:21:15,520 --> 01:21:19,104
I have neighbors I talked to the bunch times and never been like

1481
01:21:19,616 --> 01:21:20,384
I do a show about Al

1482
01:21:20,640 --> 01:21:23,200
Alex Jones

1483
01:21:23,456 --> 01:21:25,504
No I am

1484
01:21:25,760 --> 01:21:29,600
Kind of moron Alex decide if your neighbor is asking

1485
01:21:31,648 --> 01:21:34,208
Corn syrup

1486
01:21:34,464 --> 01:21:35,232
They didn't

1487
01:21:38,304 --> 01:21:42,912
I actually didn't know that actually his neighbor was in a hot tub with three other globalist

1488
01:21:43,168 --> 01:21:43,936
At the same time

1489
01:21:47,776 --> 01:21:49,568
The neighborhood

1490
01:21:50,336 --> 01:21:52,640
Ucz is corn syrup adds

1491
01:21:52,896 --> 01:21:54,944
There's no way that conversation

1492
01:21:55,200 --> 01:21:55,712
Even started there

1493
01:21:55,968 --> 01:21:56,992
The conversation

1494
01:21:57,248 --> 01:21:57,760
The

1495
01:21:58,016 --> 01:21:58,784
Started with like

1496
01:21:59,040 --> 01:21:59,808
Hey

1497
01:22:00,320 --> 01:22:01,088

Okay

1503
01:22:12,352 --> 01:22:14,144
Finger guns

1504
01:22:14,912 --> 01:22:16,192
On this episode

1505
01:22:17,984 --> 01:22:18,752
We see

1506

4 minutes

1532
01:23:54,496 --> 01:23:55,264
Very exciting

1533
01:23:55,520 --> 01:23:56,032
Wingstop

1534
01:23:56,288 --> 01:23:57,056
Supervolcano

1535
01:23:57,312 --> 01:24:00,896
I was looking at it so much action

1536
01:24:01,152 --> 01:24:05,248
In the air

1537
01:24:05,504 --> 01:24:07,808
Let me through

1538
01:24:08,064 --> 01:24:08,576
How is

1539
01:24:13,184 --> 01:24:16,000
Will it hit me in the nuclear winter

1540
01:24:16,256 --> 01:24:18,304
Oh certainly

1541
01:24:18,560 --> 01:24:22,144
What but I mean can you give it to me at a lower price than what it will be

1542
01:24:22,400 --> 01:24:28,544
I can't do an impression but I wish I could do it a person

1543
01:24:31,360 --> 01:24:31,872
Holy s*** that's

1544
01:24:32,128 --> 01:24:34,432
Embarrassing like that is next level like

1545
01:24:34,944 --> 01:24:40,320
We're going to have volcanologist daughter's going to tell you that is about to blow the craziest thing I've heard probably going to

1546
01:24:40,576 --> 01:24:45,696
Decrease the temperature of the entire world

1547
01:24:49,280 --> 01:24:51,072
Although that's a rock

1548
01:24:51,584 --> 01:24:53,632
I had a I had a fun

1549
01:24:56,704 --> 01:24:57,472
Was really

1550
01:24:57,728 --> 01:24:59,520
Interested about nada

1551
01:24:59,776 --> 01:25:05,920
Reading about supervolcano sure and the magnetic poles switching

1552
01:25:06,176 --> 01:25:12,320
Sound like a little bit after 2005

1553
01:25:12,576 --> 01:25:13,088
14

1554
01:25:13,344 --> 01:25:17,952
Like iOS pretty late but see that was when the History Channel decided like

1555
01:25:18,464 --> 01:25:22,816
We're not doing great with the Nazi stuff for a bit but we're going to switch

1556
01:25:23,072 --> 01:25:26,400
We're going to switch mood we're going to do the whole documentary on

1557
01:25:26,656 --> 01:25:30,240
Supervolcano in Yellowstone supervolcano

1558
01:25:30,496 --> 01:25:34,848
Every 500,000 years how long it's been since

1559
01:25:35,104 --> 01:25:37,920
About 500,000 years ago

1560
01:25:38,432 --> 01:25:39,968
Every time

1561
01:25:40,224 --> 01:25:41,760
Are you f***** up

1562
01:25:42,784 --> 01:25:45,344
I actually found out when supervolcano came out

1563
01:25:48,416 --> 01:25:49,696
It came out in 2005

1564
01:25:50,208 --> 01:25:50,720
I know

1565
01:25:52,256 --> 01:25:58,400
I just read about that

1566
01:25:58,656 --> 01:26:02,752
You just laid out to the plot of the movie supervolcano

1567
01:26:03,008 --> 01:26:05,056
There's two different things that alright f*** off

1568
01:26:05,312 --> 01:26:07,104
Alright

1569
01:26:08,384 --> 01:26:09,152
Is it raining

1570
01:26:13,760 --> 01:26:15,296
Attract

1571
01:26:15,552 --> 01:26:18,880
So if you thought that was like

1572
01:26:19,136 --> 01:26:19,648
Pretty

1573
01:26:20,160 --> 01:26:20,672
Gross

1574
01:26:21,184 --> 01:26:23,488
Like in terms of salesmanship

1575
01:26:23,744 --> 01:26:25,024
I agree

1576
01:26:25,280 --> 01:26:25,792
I agree

1577
01:26:28,096 --> 01:26:29,376
To know that he

1578
01:26:31,168 --> 01:26:32,960
What is a certain a certain way

1579
01:26:33,216 --> 01:26:34,240
I am kind of like

1580
01:26:34,752 --> 01:26:37,056
Get better at one thing

1581
01:26:39,360 --> 01:26:45,504
I think it's still as clunky now half the time

1582
01:26:45,760 --> 01:26:49,088
Away from the prison

1583
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:53,952
You see all of my transitions is the best version of that like

1584
01:26:54,208 --> 01:26:54,976
When I say speak

1585
01:26:55,232 --> 01:26:56,256
King of blank

1586
01:26:56,512 --> 01:26:57,536
In your head you think alike

1587
01:26:57,792 --> 01:26:58,816
The times it went well

1588
01:26:59,072 --> 01:27:00,096
You forget about the X like

1589
01:27:01,376 --> 01:27:05,728
Everything has a bunch of times they do not work out

1590
01:27:06,240 --> 01:27:06,752
And you just

1591
01:27:07,008 --> 01:27:09,312
You forget about that wait hold on did you just say

1592
01:27:09,568 --> 01:27:11,616
I think your transitions are always good

1593
01:27:12,128 --> 01:27:15,200
My mistake did you look at the platonic ideal of the

1594
01:27:15,712 --> 01:27:18,784
The platonic ideal

1595
01:27:19,040 --> 01:27:20,064
Hey sometimes like

1596
01:27:20,576 --> 01:27:21,600
This is not fair

1597
01:27:23,904 --> 01:27:27,232
Yellowstone

1598
01:27:27,488 --> 01:27:29,024
Courthouse

1599
01:27:29,280 --> 01:27:33,632
Earthquakes in around Yellowstone

1600
01:27:37,984 --> 01:27:44,128
Last time it blew up a devastated large depends on

1601
01:27:46,944 --> 01:27:47,968
One Direction

1602
01:28:00,512 --> 01:28:02,816
A supervolcano

1603
01:28:06,656 --> 01:28:07,936
Volcanologist

1604
01:28:10,240 --> 01:28:12,288
Later in the transmission

1605
01:28:14,080 --> 01:28:17,664
Anderson

1606
01:28:21,504 --> 01:28:23,808
European francs Swiss French and others

1607
01:28:24,064 --> 01:28:24,576
That are

1608
01:28:26,112 --> 01:28:26,624
He did it again

1609
01:28:26,880 --> 01:28:27,904
Are you done yet

1610
01:28:28,160 --> 01:28:30,720
Yeah yeah yeah

1611
01:28:31,232 --> 01:28:32,000
Did it back-to-back

1612
01:28:32,256 --> 01:28:34,560
And even made it clear why he's doing is coming

1613
01:28:38,912 --> 01:28:39,680
Teeth on the line

1614
01:28:39,936 --> 01:28:43,776
I clearly like there was a problem with the phone communicate

1615
01:28:44,288 --> 01:28:49,408
Galaxy of tension move couple more of these bullion

1616
01:28:49,664 --> 01:28:50,944

Twice in a row

1620
01:29:00,672 --> 01:29:03,744
All right here's the narrative Yellowstone

I'm bummed about this

1626
01:29:12,448 --> 01:29:16,800
It's cuz I'm really excited for the volcanologist I like

1627
01:29:17,056 --> 01:29:19,872
Like your volcanoes

1628
01:29:20,640 --> 01:29:22,944

You have to

1634
01:29:34,976 --> 01:29:38,816
To be terrified to take a little bit of a

1635
01:29:39,072 --> 01:29:40,096
Into

1636
01:29:40,352 --> 01:29:40,864

You could

1693
01:32:00,640 --> 01:32:01,152
Almost

1694
01:32:03,968 --> 01:32:06,016
No witchery arrow is

1695
01:32:06,528 --> 01:32:11,648
There's three arrows and there's three sixes in psychics

1696
01:32:13,952 --> 01:32:20,096
And then if you look at it you can say Google on your phone real quick the logo

1697
01:32:20,352 --> 01:32:20,864
So you can see it

1698
01:32:21,120 --> 01:32:25,728
Because it's so it's really funny that he saying Thursday inverted broke

1699
01:32:25,984 --> 01:32:26,496
Ben Cross

1700
01:32:27,008 --> 01:32:29,312
Cuz when you think about the cross the Christian cross

1701
01:32:29,824 --> 01:32:30,336
Right

1702
01:32:30,592 --> 01:32:31,104
How many points

1703
01:32:31,360 --> 01:32:33,664
Are there on that cross well there's the

1704
01:32:33,920 --> 01:32:35,456
Right there's the one of the bottom break

1705
01:32:35,712 --> 01:32:36,224
And then about

1706
01:32:36,480 --> 01:32:38,016
75% of the way up

1707
01:32:38,272 --> 01:32:40,320
There's the one on the side with the one on the other side

1708
01:32:43,648 --> 01:32:47,488
I've never seen the Christian cross but doesn't

1709
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:51,584
Four points on it cuz otherwise it's just kind of like a

1710
01:32:51,840 --> 01:32:52,864
Divining rod

1711
01:32:53,120 --> 01:32:53,632
Or something like that

1712
01:32:53,888 --> 01:32:55,168
Maybe a peace sign

1713
01:32:55,424 --> 01:32:57,216
Alright hippie peace sign with all right

1714
01:32:57,472 --> 01:32:59,520
Looking at this right now

1715
01:33:00,288 --> 01:33:00,800
Nah

1716
01:33:05,152 --> 01:33:05,920
There's nothing

1717
01:33:06,176 --> 01:33:06,688
Even though

1718
01:33:06,944 --> 01:33:13,088
I'm even looking at one of those who don't want to Google

1719
01:33:13,344 --> 01:33:15,136
Supposed to be like

1720
01:33:15,392 --> 01:33:16,928
The evil version of it

1721
01:33:17,440 --> 01:33:18,720
And it looks nothing like the

1722
01:33:19,232 --> 01:33:20,512
No that's a that's

1723
01:33:21,024 --> 01:33:21,792
That's it

1724
01:33:22,048 --> 01:33:28,192
No that's like a it's like a shity tattoo it's like a

1725
01:33:28,448 --> 01:33:30,240
No Crossing

1726
01:33:32,032 --> 01:33:32,800
Absolutely

1727
01:33:33,056 --> 01:33:38,944
I want to bake Christians into blue stupid s*** like

1728
01:33:39,200 --> 01:33:41,760
To help them become enemies of their enemies

1729
01:33:42,272 --> 01:33:44,064
Not hard to do they already do that

1730
01:33:44,320 --> 01:33:46,880
Good point rev-x Armada Grapevine

1731
01:33:47,136 --> 01:33:48,416
This is what I was trying to come up with

1732
01:33:48,672 --> 01:33:50,464
It looks like a recycling logo

1733
01:33:50,720 --> 01:33:53,536
Yes exactly that we went to

1734
01:33:53,792 --> 01:33:59,936
I was thinking biohazard but the reason I didn't recycling is.

1735
01:34:00,192 --> 01:34:01,216
When is the perfect gallon

1736
01:34:01,472 --> 01:34:02,496
I'm so they can

1737
01:34:02,752 --> 01:34:03,520
Get to talkin about like

1738
01:34:03,776 --> 01:34:05,056
The the global

1739
01:34:05,824 --> 01:34:06,336
Cuz of course

1740
01:34:06,848 --> 01:34:07,360
Anyways

1741
01:34:07,616 --> 01:34:09,152
You know that recycling is what Jesus

1742
01:34:09,920 --> 01:34:10,432
Oh my God

1743
01:34:10,688 --> 01:34:12,736
Recycling

1744
01:34:12,992 --> 01:34:14,528
Exactly the way they hate him so

1745
01:34:15,040 --> 01:34:16,320
So they talked about

1746
01:34:18,624 --> 01:34:19,392
This being

1747
01:34:19,648 --> 01:34:22,208
Exhausted the worst motiva plant in the world

1748
01:34:22,464 --> 01:34:22,976
And Alex

1749
01:34:23,232 --> 01:34:26,816
Alex is like

1750
01:34:27,072 --> 01:34:27,584
Should believe it

1751
01:34:42,432 --> 01:34:45,504
Sure

1752
01:34:50,368 --> 01:34:51,904
We talked for like 9 hours

1753
01:34:52,160 --> 01:34:55,488
Daniel estulin

1754
01:34:55,744 --> 01:34:59,328
We got gym talker

1755
01:35:00,096 --> 01:35:01,632
Boy

1756
01:35:01,888 --> 01:35:03,680
That's your go-to terms

1757
01:35:03,936 --> 01:35:04,448
That's not

1758
01:35:04,704 --> 01:35:05,728
Great let me tell you something

1759
01:35:05,984 --> 01:35:10,336
Jimmy Kimmel could never get Daniel estulin no certainly not absolutely not

1760
01:35:13,152 --> 01:35:17,248
Also grand an

1761
01:35:17,504 --> 01:35:18,784
For fun

1762
01:35:19,040 --> 01:35:20,832
Did come on Alex Jones Show

1763
01:35:21,088 --> 01:35:21,856
In the lead-up to

1764
01:35:22,112 --> 01:35:23,136
To the 2016 election

1765
01:35:23,648 --> 01:35:24,160
I told Alex

1766
01:35:24,672 --> 01:35:25,696
That

1767
01:35:25,952 --> 01:35:27,232
The Rothschild

1768
01:35:27,488 --> 01:35:28,768
Are supporting Trump

1769
01:35:29,024 --> 01:35:34,144
Right and the Rockefellers are supporting Hillary Clinton

1770
01:35:35,168 --> 01:35:36,960
Alex is like

1771
01:35:37,216 --> 01:35:37,728
I agree

1772
01:35:37,984 --> 01:35:40,032
Is a guy that's crazy

1773
01:35:40,544 --> 01:35:41,312
Sounds nuts

1774
01:35:44,640 --> 01:35:47,456
Can't believe any of that but it's just funny that I was going to be like

1775
01:35:47,712 --> 01:35:50,016
Absolutely not he would never be into them

1776
01:35:50,784 --> 01:35:53,088
I don't f****** know his beliefs are like

1777
01:35:53,344 --> 01:35:55,904
The lottery ball machine where

1778
01:35:56,160 --> 01:36:01,024
Where everything is just too like swirling around then one suddenly pops out in the vacuum

1779
01:36:02,560 --> 01:36:03,072
The Escalade

1780
01:36:03,328 --> 01:36:04,608
When has that Beyond

1781
01:36:04,864 --> 01:36:05,888
The stuff we've already talked about

1782
01:36:06,144 --> 01:36:07,680
About him like he has that

1783
01:36:07,936 --> 01:36:10,240
In his

1784
01:36:13,056 --> 01:36:13,824
Throw it in the bag

1785
01:36:14,080 --> 01:36:19,200
You might remember that earlier this episode Alex said that Al Gore

1786
01:36:19,456 --> 01:36:19,968
Got caught on

1787
01:36:20,736 --> 01:36:22,016
Buy-Back list

1788
01:36:23,808 --> 01:36:25,600
He's trying to get kids

1789
01:36:25,856 --> 01:36:28,672
Turn against their parents remember this video

1790
01:36:30,208 --> 01:36:36,352
I think I might this this sounds sound absurdly familiar

1791
01:36:36,608 --> 01:36:40,704
You try and Jog your memory whilst I look at you skeptically

1792
01:36:40,960 --> 01:36:43,008
So I remember him being in a gym

1793
01:36:43,264 --> 01:36:45,824
It was a video that was like

1794
01:36:46,080 --> 01:36:47,616
That very well could be right

1795
01:36:47,872 --> 01:36:49,152
30 degrees

1796
01:36:49,408 --> 01:36:50,688
Looking at him

1797
01:36:50,944 --> 01:36:51,456
From

1798
01:36:52,480 --> 01:36:54,016
A distance of probably like

1799
01:36:54,528 --> 01:36:55,552
150ft

1800
01:36:55,808 --> 01:37:01,952
And you could see just a part of that it was almost like an assembly that I remember bro people were sitting on me

1801
01:37:02,464 --> 01:37:05,536
I wasn't looking for you to describe the measles then

1802
01:37:05,792 --> 01:37:07,072
I want

1803
01:37:07,328 --> 01:37:13,472
I'm sorry but that's the problem I remember the image another word

1804
01:37:13,984 --> 01:37:17,568
Like like if I was going to

1805
01:37:18,080 --> 01:37:20,128
Encapsulate what I think about what

1806
01:37:20,384 --> 01:37:20,896
He said

1807
01:37:21,152 --> 01:37:24,480
It was probably something along the lines of

1808
01:37:26,528 --> 01:37:30,368
If we are going to

1809
01:37:30,624 --> 01:37:31,392
I can't talk and pull it

1810
01:37:31,648 --> 01:37:33,952
Remember

1811
01:37:34,720 --> 01:37:36,512
Let's see if this jogs your memory

1812
01:37:36,768 --> 01:37:37,280
Nugget

1813
01:37:37,536 --> 01:37:43,680
That is exactly what I was

1814
01:38:12,608 --> 01:38:14,656
How do I live

1815
01:38:17,216 --> 01:38:19,264
Isabel shopping bag she forgot

1816
01:38:21,568 --> 01:38:24,128
I'm very very very environmentally conscious children

1817
01:38:41,536 --> 01:38:43,584
State is Bosch

1818
01:38:43,840 --> 01:38:45,376
State mandated close by

1819
01:38:49,728 --> 01:38:51,520
So this is the first

1820
01:38:52,032 --> 01:38:52,544
Peace

1821
01:38:52,800 --> 01:38:53,568
Advised

1822
01:38:54,080 --> 01:38:58,944
It's about what is puritanism

1823
01:38:59,200 --> 01:39:00,992
From the beginning of

1824
01:39:01,248 --> 01:39:02,016
F****** America

1825
01:39:02,272 --> 01:39:03,552
No

1826
01:39:03,808 --> 01:39:07,392
Puritans used to say is a good idea

1827
01:39:07,648 --> 01:39:09,952
He's also described

1828
01:39:10,208 --> 01:39:11,744
Like good best practices

1829
01:39:12,256 --> 01:39:14,048
Oh you mean like using

1830
01:39:15,584 --> 01:39:16,864
Specifically about kids

1831
01:39:18,144 --> 01:39:19,936
Calling bulshit on their parents

1832
01:39:20,448 --> 01:39:24,032
Everybody

1833
01:39:24,288 --> 01:39:26,080
Oh yeah it's all great stuff

1834
01:39:26,336 --> 01:39:28,640
I got the idea that like if you wanted a rush

1835
01:39:28,896 --> 01:39:29,664
Hang your goddamn clothes

1836
01:39:29,920 --> 01:39:36,064
Have you wasting electricity and water

1837
01:39:36,320 --> 01:39:37,344
Had a dryer

1838
01:39:37,856 --> 01:39:39,648
But you know what we also had a basement

1839
01:39:40,160 --> 01:39:42,720
We hung clothes to dry

1840
01:39:42,976 --> 01:39:44,512
My parents are pissed off about like

1841
01:39:44,768 --> 01:39:46,304
Daddy like wasting resources

1842
01:39:46,816 --> 01:39:50,912
We can do that my girlfriend and I are discovering Bowl

1843
01:39:52,448 --> 01:39:52,960
No hanging

1844
01:39:53,216 --> 01:39:53,728
Fine

1845
01:39:53,984 --> 01:39:54,752
Let's

1846
01:39:56,032 --> 01:39:56,544
Other

1847
01:39:56,800 --> 01:39:59,104
Consideration

1848
01:39:59,360 --> 01:40:01,920
That's another substitute

1849
01:40:02,176 --> 01:40:02,688
Consideration

1850
01:40:02,944 --> 01:40:04,480
If you don't have those

1851
01:40:04,736 --> 01:40:06,272
Consideration

1852
01:40:06,784 --> 01:40:12,928
Everybody back I wouldn't do that I would like also every time I wash my

1853
01:40:13,184 --> 01:40:17,024
Clothes like I need them now

1854
01:40:17,280 --> 01:40:21,120
I do not wash my clothes until I have no clothes to wear

1855
01:40:21,376 --> 01:40:22,400
But same thing with like

1856
01:40:22,656 --> 01:40:23,936
I I grew is like a

1857
01:40:24,448 --> 01:40:27,520
I grew up with never having a dishwasher

1858
01:40:28,032 --> 01:40:28,544
Bigger

1859
01:40:28,800 --> 01:40:30,080
You can just wash dishes

1860
01:40:30,336 --> 01:40:30,848
Shoes by hand

1861
01:40:31,104 --> 01:40:32,384
Rag use less water

1862
01:40:33,152 --> 01:40:33,664
You can do that

1863
01:40:33,920 --> 01:40:35,456
So that was always the

1864
01:40:35,968 --> 01:40:36,992
Principal that I grew up in

1865
01:40:37,504 --> 01:40:38,528
It's not like

1866
01:40:39,040 --> 01:40:41,344
Whatever whatever is going on

1867
01:40:41,856 --> 01:40:43,904
Like that Alex is describing

1868
01:40:44,160 --> 01:40:45,184
In this

1869
01:40:46,464 --> 01:40:46,976
Article

1870
01:40:48,768 --> 01:40:49,536
Is just older

1871
01:40:50,304 --> 01:40:51,328
It just old ideas

1872
01:40:51,584 --> 01:40:53,632
But he's taking issue with the idea that

1873
01:40:53,888 --> 01:40:55,168
Children are like

1874
01:40:55,680 --> 01:40:56,704
Getting into

1875
01:40:57,216 --> 01:40:58,240
And that to me is weird

1876
01:40:58,752 --> 01:41:01,312
Brittany is strange because kids are being taught

1877
01:41:01,824 --> 01:41:03,104
More or less. Like

1878
01:41:03,872 --> 01:41:04,384
Hey guys

1879
01:41:06,432 --> 01:41:06,944
Resources

1880
01:41:07,968 --> 01:41:08,736
We may not have him

1881
01:41:08,992 --> 01:41:09,504
Prolong

1882
01:41:09,760 --> 01:41:10,784
We might have

1883
01:41:11,040 --> 01:41:12,576
Reminder f*****-up

1884
01:41:12,832 --> 01:41:13,600
And you might

1885
01:41:14,368 --> 01:41:14,880
Be the one

1886
01:41:15,392 --> 01:41:16,672
Who are going to stop

1887
01:41:16,928 --> 01:41:17,440
In fact

1888
01:41:18,208 --> 01:41:22,048
You will be the ones who were going to suffer

1889
01:41:22,560 --> 01:41:23,840
Will not will be dead

1890
01:41:24,096 --> 01:41:30,240
Pinterest

1891
01:41:30,496 --> 01:41:32,032
Dumb s*** your parents are doing

1892
01:41:32,288 --> 01:41:34,336
Because they're going to die before they have to deal with

1893
01:41:34,592 --> 01:41:35,104
The consequences

1894
01:41:35,360 --> 01:41:35,872
By the way

1895
01:41:36,128 --> 01:41:40,992
All of them have led to you dying a lot faster than you should

1896
01:41:41,248 --> 01:41:44,320
The idea that what Alex

1897
01:41:44,576 --> 01:41:46,624
Seems to be taking issue with In that clip

1898
01:41:46,880 --> 01:41:48,416
That we just listen to is

1899
01:41:48,672 --> 01:41:49,184
He's

1900
01:41:49,440 --> 01:41:49,952
Madoff

1901
01:41:50,208 --> 01:41:52,000
Kids are asserting of voice

1902
01:41:52,256 --> 01:41:54,816
I don't understand why that is a problem

1903
01:41:56,864 --> 01:41:57,888
I don't understand because

1904
01:41:59,680 --> 01:42:01,472
Shoulder the burden

1905
01:42:01,984 --> 01:42:02,496
Right

1906
01:42:02,752 --> 01:42:06,848
So you are not

1907
01:42:07,104 --> 01:42:08,896
Capable of unless you're

1908
01:42:11,456 --> 01:42:13,504
Denying or Define your parents

1909
01:42:13,760 --> 01:42:15,040
Until you are all right

1910
01:42:15,296 --> 01:42:17,856
Also f*** them they're just meat

1911
01:42:19,648 --> 01:42:22,720
Exactly so I guess. Can you disagree with them

1912
01:42:25,280 --> 01:42:28,352
Super weird around

1913
01:42:28,608 --> 01:42:30,400
You are playing the Clippers algor

1914
01:42:32,960 --> 01:42:35,776
Control

1915
01:42:36,032 --> 01:42:36,544
It's about

1916
01:42:37,056 --> 01:42:43,200
I have to practice it

1917
01:42:44,480 --> 01:42:46,272
Here it is before I say this

1918
01:42:46,784 --> 01:42:49,344
I need you to know that I am already right

1919
01:42:49,600 --> 01:42:50,112
Because

1920
01:42:50,368 --> 01:42:56,000
Baby what he says is going to disagree with me and read what I say

1921
01:42:56,256 --> 01:42:57,536
What you need to know

1922
01:42:57,792 --> 01:42:59,072
Music

1923
01:42:59,328 --> 01:43:02,400
Through the lens of the always baby

1924
01:43:03,424 --> 01:43:09,056
You picked up on the exact subtext of that

1925
01:43:09,568 --> 01:43:10,080
I'm sorry to keep

1926
01:43:10,336 --> 01:43:11,104
Keep bringing up the fact that

1927
01:43:11,360 --> 01:43:12,128
I'm going over all this

1928
01:43:12,384 --> 01:43:12,896
None dare call it

1929
01:43:19,040 --> 01:43:21,600
To do in that world one of the things they do

1930
01:43:21,856 --> 01:43:22,624
So much

1931
01:43:22,880 --> 01:43:24,416
Is that preemptive

1932
01:43:24,672 --> 01:43:25,184
Groundwork

1933
01:43:28,256 --> 01:43:34,400
I need to be on board before we can confirm

1934
01:43:34,912 --> 01:43:41,056
You need to know that you need to view it through the lens of me already having told you what it is he's going to say

1935
01:43:41,312 --> 01:43:42,592
If even when he says

1936
01:43:42,848 --> 01:43:45,920
That is not what I told you he's going to say

1937
01:43:46,176 --> 01:43:46,944
You need to know that

1938
01:43:47,456 --> 01:43:48,736
Truly saying

1939
01:43:48,992 --> 01:43:52,320
The thing I told you he's going to

1940
01:43:52,576 --> 01:43:53,088
X

1941
01:43:53,856 --> 01:43:54,624
With no car

1942
01:43:55,136 --> 01:43:58,976
You might have some thoughts about the other

1943
01:44:01,024 --> 01:44:02,304
F****** allow that to possibly have

1944
01:44:02,560 --> 01:44:04,864
What is a what is

1945
01:44:05,376 --> 01:44:05,888
Slept

1946
01:44:06,400 --> 01:44:06,912
My

1947
01:44:12,032 --> 01:44:12,544
Exactly the same

1948
01:44:12,800 --> 01:44:15,104
It's crazy

1949
01:44:25,088 --> 01:44:26,880
Real quick it's really funny cuz Alex is

1950
01:44:27,136 --> 01:44:27,648
Just playing

1951
01:44:27,904 --> 01:44:28,416
He stole from

1952
01:44:28,672 --> 01:44:29,184
1 backstroke

1953
01:44:29,440 --> 01:44:30,208
Cuz you can hear Glenn Beck

1954
01:44:31,744 --> 01:44:33,536
Chiming in

1955
01:44:33,792 --> 01:44:36,096
Sad

1956
01:44:36,352 --> 01:44:38,400
Yeah I did hear that

1957
01:44:38,656 --> 01:44:43,008
These just I thought that was the person who was videotaping

1958
01:44:43,264 --> 01:44:45,568
And this was at the time where people still use Giant

1959
01:44:45,824 --> 01:44:49,152
Dude that's sad

1960
01:45:28,832 --> 01:45:33,184
How's the weather right there you know why

1961
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:37,024
He has to do that because

1962
01:45:37,280 --> 01:45:38,816
He's stealing clips from Glenn Beck

1963
01:45:39,072 --> 01:45:43,680
Cosmic Eclipse packaging Glenn Beck news

1964
01:45:43,936 --> 01:45:44,448
How

1965
01:45:45,216 --> 01:45:45,728
How

1966
01:45:45,984 --> 01:45:46,496
How

1967
01:45:47,008 --> 01:45:48,032
Wow

1968
01:45:48,800 --> 01:45:49,568
What what

1969
01:45:49,824 --> 01:45:54,176
Kind of murder wait wait till the end of this

1970
01:45:55,712 --> 01:45:58,272
There are some things about our world

1971
01:46:11,072 --> 01:46:12,608
You don't really, none of that much

1972
01:46:13,120 --> 01:46:15,936
Central argument

1973
01:46:16,192 --> 01:46:19,520
Pretty much all the audio from the stolen

1974
01:46:19,776 --> 01:46:20,288
Glenn Beck

1975
01:46:21,312 --> 01:46:22,080
Al Gore

1976
01:46:22,336 --> 01:46:24,896
Commando footage that he found

1977
01:46:27,456 --> 01:46:28,480
I would posit that

1978
01:46:29,760 --> 01:46:30,528
Al Gore is saying

1979
01:46:30,784 --> 01:46:31,296
Is that

1980
01:46:31,808 --> 01:46:32,320
Certain

1981
01:46:33,088 --> 01:46:34,368
Things are entrenched

1982
01:46:34,624 --> 01:46:36,160
In people's worldview

1983
01:46:36,416 --> 01:46:37,696
And you children

1984
01:46:37,952 --> 01:46:39,488
Younger people

1985
01:46:40,256 --> 01:46:42,048
Have an ability to not be

1986
01:46:42,560 --> 01:46:44,864
Entrenched by that be able to see the bigger picture

1987
01:46:45,376 --> 01:46:46,656
When we were younger

1988
01:46:46,912 --> 01:46:49,216
The example would be that

1989
01:46:49,728 --> 01:46:50,240
Civil rights

1990
01:46:51,008 --> 01:46:51,776
Parents couldn't

1991
01:46:52,032 --> 01:46:53,312
See the forest for the trees

1992
01:46:53,568 --> 01:46:55,872
Because they have been brought up in that context

1993
01:46:56,384 --> 01:46:58,176
That Mill you did not allow them

1994
01:46:58,432 --> 01:46:59,712
60 outside of that box

1995
01:47:00,480 --> 01:47:01,248
For you

1996
01:47:01,504 --> 01:47:02,016
Perhaps

1997
01:47:02,272 --> 01:47:02,784
It is

1998
01:47:03,552 --> 01:47:04,576
This climate stuff

1999
01:47:06,368 --> 01:47:08,672
Your parents don't understand it maybe you do

2000
01:47:09,184 --> 01:47:09,696
He's speaking

2001
01:47:09,952 --> 01:47:13,024
Specifically to people who were involved

2002
01:47:14,048 --> 01:47:14,560
Like a climate

2003
01:47:14,816 --> 01:47:15,584
Yeah

2004
01:47:15,840 --> 01:47:16,864
Not like

2005
01:47:17,632 --> 01:47:19,424
It's not

2006
01:47:20,960 --> 01:47:21,984
I can't

2007
01:47:22,240 --> 01:47:22,752
I can't

2008
01:47:23,008 --> 01:47:23,520
Imagine

2009
01:47:24,032 --> 01:47:24,800
Anyway you

2010
01:47:25,056 --> 01:47:25,568
You can hear that

2011
01:47:26,592 --> 01:47:27,104
And Missy

2012
01:47:28,640 --> 01:47:29,408
I really can't

2013
01:47:30,176 --> 01:47:34,528
Like it seemed so clear

2014
01:47:35,040 --> 01:47:35,552
And

2015
01:47:36,320 --> 01:47:41,696
70% of people thought Martin Luther King Jr was doing the wrong thing

2016
01:47:41,952 --> 01:47:42,720
Because again

2017
01:47:43,744 --> 01:47:47,584
You guys don't know this because people pretend that it wasn't true

2018
01:47:47,840 --> 01:47:49,888
But Martin Luther King jr. was a

2019
01:47:50,144 --> 01:47:51,168
Really really

2020
01:47:51,424 --> 01:47:52,960
Really unpopular guy

2021
01:47:53,216 --> 01:47:53,984
During his time

2022
01:47:54,240 --> 01:47:56,800
All of you all of us kids

2023
01:47:57,056 --> 01:47:58,592
Realize at the time

2024
01:48:00,128 --> 01:48:02,176
For f****** insane

2025
01:48:02,432 --> 01:48:02,944
You

2026
01:48:04,480 --> 01:48:05,504
You can f******

2027
01:48:06,272 --> 01:48:07,552
How can you not

2028
01:48:07,808 --> 01:48:08,832
Look at that and think

2029
01:48:10,624 --> 01:48:11,904
S*** I know exactly

2030
01:48:12,160 --> 01:48:12,672
What he saying

2031
01:48:12,928 --> 01:48:13,952
I know exactly what

2032
01:48:14,208 --> 01:48:16,000
F****** Santa

2033
01:48:16,256 --> 01:48:16,768
How is it

2034
01:48:17,024 --> 01:48:17,792
Possible

2035
01:48:19,072 --> 01:48:20,352
We're

2036
01:48:20,608 --> 01:48:21,376
Perfect

2037
01:48:21,888 --> 01:48:23,936
Oftentimes whatever there's a crisis

2038
01:48:24,192 --> 01:48:26,752
This point it only illuminates

2039
01:48:27,264 --> 01:48:29,056
Where

2040
01:48:29,568 --> 01:48:30,080
Problem

2041
01:48:30,336 --> 01:48:32,128
I'm sorry

2042
01:48:32,384 --> 01:48:33,152
Potentials for what

2043
01:48:33,920 --> 01:48:34,432
We can make

2044
01:48:36,224 --> 01:48:36,736
Sort of

2045
01:48:37,504 --> 01:48:38,784
Spiritually what's going on in

2046
01:48:39,040 --> 01:48:41,856
That clip about

2047
01:48:42,112 --> 01:48:43,392
The consistent

2048
01:48:43,904 --> 01:48:44,928
Problem of the past

2049
01:48:45,440 --> 01:48:47,488
And the consistent promise of the future

2050
01:48:49,792 --> 01:48:51,584
It is what it is

2051
01:48:51,840 --> 01:48:53,120
Doesn't agree with that

2052
01:48:53,632 --> 01:48:55,680
I would save it if you

2053
01:48:55,936 --> 01:48:57,216
Don't agree with that

2054
01:48:59,520 --> 01:49:00,032
21

2055
01:49:00,800 --> 01:49:01,568
Argue

2056
01:49:02,336 --> 01:49:03,104
On the merits

2057
01:49:03,360 --> 01:49:03,872
Against

2058
01:49:04,128 --> 01:49:04,640
Climate

2059
01:49:04,896 --> 01:49:05,664
ShopRite

2060
01:49:06,944 --> 01:49:08,992
Except that metaphorically

2061
01:49:09,504 --> 01:49:11,808
You're saying that fighting again

2062
01:49:12,064 --> 01:49:18,208
People who are anti Civil Right

2063
01:49:21,280 --> 01:49:21,792
Like I don't

2064
01:49:22,048 --> 01:49:23,584
There's so many

2065
01:49:23,840 --> 01:49:24,864
There's so many thing

2066
01:49:26,144 --> 01:49:26,656
On

2067
01:49:26,912 --> 01:49:28,448
The right because of

2068
01:49:28,704 --> 01:49:29,216
My

2069
01:49:29,728 --> 01:49:31,776
My family and the people I know

2070
01:49:33,568 --> 01:49:34,592
Understand where you can

2071
01:49:35,872 --> 01:49:36,384
But

2072
01:49:36,896 --> 01:49:37,408
You can take

2073
01:49:37,664 --> 01:49:38,688
What he said

2074
01:49:41,248 --> 01:49:42,528
Turn it into something bad

2075
01:49:43,296 --> 01:49:44,320
You're insane

2076
01:49:44,832 --> 01:49:47,648
Like there is no way that you can listen to that

2077
01:49:47,904 --> 01:49:49,440
And not process it correctly

2078
01:49:49,952 --> 01:49:51,232
Unless you are f******

2079
01:49:51,488 --> 01:49:52,000
King Kong

2080
01:49:52,256 --> 01:49:53,792
There's there's just no way

2081
01:49:54,048 --> 01:49:54,816
It's not possible

2082
01:49:55,584 --> 01:49:56,864
If you look at that

2083
01:49:57,120 --> 01:49:59,936
And you say there is something malicious in that

2084
01:50:00,192 --> 01:50:03,008
Behind the idea of you should never trust

2085
01:50:03,264 --> 01:50:03,776
Your parents

2086
01:50:04,032 --> 01:50:04,800
You're a f******

2087
01:50:05,568 --> 01:50:06,336
Your f******

2088
01:50:06,592 --> 01:50:07,616
Idiot

2089
01:50:07,872 --> 01:50:08,384
I'm done

2090
01:50:08,896 --> 01:50:09,408
You know what

2091
01:50:09,664 --> 01:50:11,200
Glenn Beck

2092
01:50:11,456 --> 01:50:14,016
He's a really good guy.

2093
01:50:14,272 --> 01:50:17,344
Are we going to f****** mailed in 2009

2094
01:50:18,112 --> 01:50:18,624
I'm thrilled for you

2095
01:50:19,648 --> 01:50:21,184
But I'm even more threads

01:50:21,696 --> 01:50:24,768
Cuz we're about to find out

2097
01:50:27,328 --> 01:50:28,864

2098
01:50:29,120 --> 01:50:30,144
Million

2099
01:50:31,168 --> 01:50:32,192
Dude

2100
01:50:32,448 --> 01:50:33,472
We're about to find out what

2101
01:50:33,984 --> 01:50:34,752
When

2102
01:50:35,008 --> 01:50:35,520
2

2103
01:50:35,776 --> 01:50:36,288
Not strange

2104
01:50:37,312 --> 01:50:37,824
Sit down

2105
01:50:38,336 --> 01:50:41,920
All right with Smog and stop being fake and circuiting real

2106
01:50:42,688 --> 01:50:43,712
Stop being polite

2107
01:50:44,224 --> 01:50:47,296
And start listening I've never watch the real world I was

2108
01:50:47,808 --> 01:50:50,112
Had to pull it volcanologist

2109
01:50:52,416 --> 01:50:54,464
You know I got destroyed in the reboot

2110
01:50:56,256 --> 01:50:57,024
No

2111
01:50:57,280 --> 01:50:58,048
Oh

2112
01:51:00,864 --> 01:51:01,632
Now I know I don't have

2113
01:51:01,888 --> 01:51:02,400
Taste for that

2114
01:51:07,776 --> 01:51:08,544
Because this dude

2115
01:51:09,312 --> 01:51:10,336
No f****** time for a

2116
01:51:11,104 --> 01:51:12,896
He is just about to science

2117
01:51:13,408 --> 01:51:14,176
And it's delightful

2118
01:51:14,432 --> 01:51:14,944
Okay

2119
01:51:19,808 --> 01:51:25,184
Dr. Robert Trombley

2120
01:51:28,000 --> 01:51:31,072
Exactly

2121
01:51:31,328 --> 01:51:32,608
I am self physically

2122
01:51:36,448 --> 01:51:37,984
From

2123
01:51:39,008 --> 01:51:40,800
You got to expect that Alex

2124
01:51:41,056 --> 01:51:41,568
Thanks

2125
01:51:41,824 --> 01:51:47,712
Did this guy is going to be like

2126
01:51:47,968 --> 01:51:48,480
Tomorrow

2127
01:51:48,736 --> 01:51:50,528
You should buy gold

2128
01:51:51,040 --> 01:51:52,576
The only thing that happens really fast

2129
01:51:52,832 --> 01:51:53,600
Is Alex

2130
01:51:54,112 --> 01:51:54,624
His narrative

2131
01:51:54,880 --> 01:51:55,392
Boston

2132
01:51:56,416 --> 01:51:57,696
But thank you very much for happening

2133
01:51:57,952 --> 01:51:59,488
Delighted to be here with you

2134
01:52:00,512 --> 01:52:06,400
You're talking about asteroids that I was originally trained

2135
01:52:07,680 --> 01:52:11,520
So how about I was very interested in that as well

2136
01:52:12,288 --> 01:52:15,104
First of all four starters a relative to Yellowstone

2137
01:52:16,896 --> 01:52:20,224
Brother should not be any Panic or or a fear

2138
01:52:20,480 --> 01:52:22,528
Amongst the populace at the end

2139
01:52:22,784 --> 01:52:24,832
The moment that's pretty clear

2140
01:52:25,600 --> 01:52:26,112
Pretty blonde

2141
01:52:27,904 --> 01:52:29,440
In case you thought that was a little subtle

2142
01:52:29,696 --> 01:52:31,232
AKC

2143
01:52:38,144 --> 01:52:39,680
So it's only erupted

2144
01:52:39,936 --> 01:52:40,448
3 * 8

2145
01:52:40,960 --> 01:52:41,728
Entire history

2146
01:52:42,496 --> 01:52:45,568
But there is no cuz I said there's no real cause for alarm at

2147
01:52:45,824 --> 01:52:46,592
At the moment

2148
01:52:47,360 --> 01:52:49,408
Attract the earthquake activity

2149
01:52:49,664 --> 01:52:51,200
Quite a bit

2150
01:52:51,968 --> 01:52:53,760
Blade

2151
01:52:55,808 --> 01:52:57,856
But this is a common occurrence

2152
01:52:58,624 --> 01:53:01,696
That's pretty blunt pretty

2153
01:53:01,952 --> 01:53:03,232
It's really cutting dry

2154
01:53:05,280 --> 01:53:05,792
You know how

2155
01:53:07,072 --> 01:53:07,584
In his life

2156
01:53:09,888 --> 01:53:11,168
He kept trying to like

2157
01:53:11,936 --> 01:53:16,288
We got to do what I want

2158
01:53:16,544 --> 01:53:17,056
Look

2159
01:53:17,312 --> 01:53:18,848
You've already said no to the stuff

2160
01:53:19,360 --> 01:53:21,920
Let me try and throw you into this narrative and maybe you'll say yes

2161
01:53:22,176 --> 01:53:23,200
After that come on give me some

2162
01:53:23,712 --> 01:53:24,224
The next

2163
01:53:24,480 --> 01:53:25,760
Five or six clips

2164
01:53:26,528 --> 01:53:27,296

2165
01:53:27,552 --> 01:53:29,344
So desperately trying to be like

2166
01:53:30,112 --> 01:53:31,904
Please make people scared

2167
01:53:34,464 --> 01:53:36,000
Work it's so gorgeous

2168
01:53:36,256 --> 01:53:37,792
My first

2169
01:53:38,048 --> 01:53:39,072
Response to this clip

2170
01:53:39,584 --> 01:53:41,376
In the context of all of the other clip

2171
01:53:41,632 --> 01:53:42,144
Is like

2172
01:53:43,424 --> 01:53:45,728
When did somebody else take over booking

2173
01:53:47,008 --> 01:53:48,032
Isaac

2174
01:53:48,288 --> 01:53:50,592
Lego is rubbed

2175
01:53:50,848 --> 01:53:51,872
Sicilian the mix right

2176
01:53:52,128 --> 01:53:52,896
I don't know

2177
01:53:53,408 --> 01:53:55,968
What's the temperature

2178
01:53:56,224 --> 01:53:57,760
Somebody is booking gas

2179
01:53:58,784 --> 01:54:00,320
And occasionally

2180
01:54:01,088 --> 01:54:02,112
Feels like they're like

2181
01:54:02,880 --> 01:54:03,648
Alex Jones is f******

2182
01:54:03,904 --> 01:54:05,184
Stupid and I will show the world

You know cuz like

2184
01:54:10,560 --> 01:54:12,096
The reason I'm laughing a little bit is like

2185
01:54:12,352 --> 01:54:12,864
How do you spell

2186
01:54:15,680 --> 01:54:16,448
Good

2187
01:54:16,704 --> 01:54:18,496
Goodbye

2190
01:54:20,544 --> 01:54:25,408
Good 4848 Infowars Booker would be a completely different

2191
01:54:25,664 --> 01:54:27,200
On good faith you booked him thinking

2192
01:54:27,456 --> 01:54:29,760
He would go along with our

2193
01:54:30,016 --> 01:54:32,320
Took

2194
01:54:32,576 --> 01:54:35,904
Difficult time

2195
01:54:36,160 --> 01:54:37,952
They continue this conversation

2196
01:54:38,208 --> 01:54:41,280
That tickled my brain to a very serious

2197
01:54:43,840 --> 01:54:47,424
Rock Hudson

2198
01:54:47,680 --> 01:54:48,448
Who Was books

01:54:48,704 --> 01:54:53,824

2202
01:55:01,760 --> 01:55:04,064
Broken away from the

01:55:16,096 --> 01:55:16,608
But like

01:55:18,656 --> 01:55:19,168

Contact with people that disagree with him

2237
01:56:24,192 --> 01:56:25,472
He's going to cry and scream

2238
01:56:25,984 --> 01:56:27,264
But back

2239
01:56:28,288 --> 01:56:29,568

Just like Trump's lawyers are like

2260
01:57:18,208 --> 01:57:24,352
Don't don't talk to them because you're under your going to lie

2261
01:57:24,608 --> 01:57:26,656
But at the same time he doesn't

2262
01:57:26,912 --> 01:57:27,680
I have also.

2263
01:57:27,936 --> 01:57:28,960
Cadre of people

2264
01:57:29,472 --> 01:57:29,984
Damn talk to

2265
01:57:30,496 --> 01:57:31,008
So you dumb

2266
01:57:32,032 --> 01:57:33,568
He doesn't have like

2267
01:57:33,824 --> 01:57:34,848
You know

2268
01:57:35,872 --> 01:57:36,896
He doesn't have

2269
01:57:37,152 --> 01:57:38,944
Larry Nichols isn't there

2270
01:57:39,200 --> 01:57:39,968
Steve pieczenik

2271
01:57:40,480 --> 01:57:43,808
The two of them know each other I believe that that

2272
01:57:44,064 --> 01:57:45,600
He's not around

2273
01:57:48,928 --> 01:57:49,696
Right

2274
01:57:50,208 --> 01:57:50,976
Justbet

2275
01:57:52,256 --> 01:57:53,536
You like a lot of these

2276
01:57:53,792 --> 01:57:54,816
Classical weirdo

2277
01:57:55,328 --> 01:57:57,376
Visual who have been a part of his life

2278
01:57:57,888 --> 01:58:00,704
I can always put my elbow on you and you

2279
01:58:00,960 --> 01:58:04,032
Are you lean on me yet

2280
01:58:04,288 --> 01:58:05,312
They're not around

2281
01:58:05,568 --> 01:58:06,336
He has to do

2282
01:58:09,664 --> 01:58:15,808
Not AR-15 I love 2009

2283
01:58:16,064 --> 01:58:17,088
Because this is

2284
01:58:17,344 --> 01:58:17,856
Chaos

2285
01:58:18,112 --> 01:58:19,136
It's the Wild West

2286
01:58:19,392 --> 01:58:20,160
Yeah but

2287
01:58:20,672 --> 01:58:22,976
Also suffer from frequent volcano

2288
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:24,512
And

2289
01:58:25,792 --> 01:58:27,072
That is your ideal Transit

2290
01:58:27,328 --> 01:58:29,376
Russian

2291
01:58:29,632 --> 01:58:30,912
The greatest one you've ever done

2292
01:58:31,168 --> 01:58:32,960
You nailed that so Alex

2293
01:58:34,496 --> 01:58:35,520
Keeps trying to

2294
01:58:35,776 --> 01:58:36,288
To get like

2295
01:58:37,056 --> 01:58:37,568
This guy

2296
01:58:37,824 --> 01:58:38,336
Probably

2297
01:58:38,592 --> 01:58:39,104
To be like

2298
01:58:40,128 --> 01:58:41,408
You should be scared

2299
01:58:41,664 --> 01:58:42,432
Thank you for like

2300
01:58:43,200 --> 01:58:43,712
No

2301
01:58:43,968 --> 01:58:45,248
So here is Alex asking

2302
01:58:45,504 --> 01:58:46,272
Is there any day

2303
01:58:47,552 --> 01:58:50,368
Is there any danger of erupting

2304
01:58:54,720 --> 01:58:56,768
That was the last eruption

2305
01:58:57,280 --> 01:58:59,072
Okay first of all

2306
01:59:00,864 --> 01:59:02,656
No there's no real danger of it erupt

2307
01:59:02,912 --> 01:59:03,424
Looking at the MoMA

2308
01:59:06,496 --> 01:59:09,056
North my normal or take on this is it would

2309
01:59:09,312 --> 01:59:10,592
Probably be a rapper

2310
01:59:10,848 --> 01:59:13,408
For several hundred or even thousands of years

2311
01:59:13,664 --> 01:59:14,688
Okay so that's not

2312
01:59:20,064 --> 01:59:23,392
He does not go on to invalidate that.

2313
01:59:24,160 --> 01:59:24,672
Well look

2314
01:59:25,184 --> 01:59:25,696
The world

2315
01:59:26,464 --> 01:59:28,512
It seems like we're entering it

2316
01:59:29,024 --> 01:59:32,608
Are aware there's way more eruptions of volcanoes

2317
01:59:32,864 --> 01:59:34,144
Is that true

2318
01:59:41,312 --> 01:59:46,432
It could be but there's no real indication of that at the moment I mean it's not that

2319
01:59:46,688 --> 01:59:52,832
It's not acting up in the normal

2320
01:59:56,672 --> 01:59:58,208
Read it out in Alaska

2321
01:59:58,464 --> 02:00:03,328
Totally different super volcano

2322
02:00:03,584 --> 02:00:06,656
Rita's name of volcano is

2323
02:00:06,912 --> 02:00:08,704
Sky Zone

2324
02:00:12,800 --> 02:00:13,568
It's like why

2325
02:00:14,592 --> 02:00:16,128
There's an uptick in volcano

2326
02:00:16,640 --> 02:00:17,920
The right there's a lot of volcano

2327
02:00:18,432 --> 02:00:20,480
I'm going to go with a hard no

2328
02:00:33,024 --> 02:00:34,560
No that's a somewhat Avenue

2329
02:00:34,816 --> 02:00:37,888
Illusion that we normally have about 4260 eruptions

2330
02:00:38,144 --> 02:00:38,912
The year

2331
02:00:39,168 --> 02:00:39,936
Love it

2332
02:00:40,704 --> 02:00:44,032
The reason that it appears that way it's because of the

2333
02:00:44,544 --> 02:00:47,360
Technology in the mass media we have

2334
02:00:47,616 --> 02:00:49,664
Now I mean you know 10-15 years ago

2335
02:00:51,968 --> 02:00:54,272
A lot of people didn't even know when the Rapture went off

2336
02:00:54,528 --> 02:00:56,576
Except those of us in the business

2337
02:00:57,344 --> 02:00:58,880
And sometimes we get that

2338
02:00:59,136 --> 02:01:04,000
We're a week later even longer

2339
02:01:04,256 --> 02:01:07,840
Option gloves off anywhere in the world including in the oceans

2340
02:01:08,352 --> 02:01:09,376
And so forth

2341
02:01:11,424 --> 02:01:11,936
I mean in the ocean

2342
02:01:12,192 --> 02:01:12,704
Look up like that

2343
02:01:13,216 --> 02:01:14,496
We know about it

2344
02:01:15,776 --> 02:01:19,104
So that no that does not

2345
02:01:19,360 --> 02:01:22,176
This is my favorite volcanologist

2346
02:01:24,736 --> 02:01:26,784
But why do people like why are people freaking out

2347
02:01:27,040 --> 02:01:27,552
Yeah

2348
02:01:36,256 --> 02:01:37,024
Well

2349
02:01:39,072 --> 02:01:40,608
I don't really know why

2350
02:01:44,448 --> 02:01:45,728
Like I don't know why

2351
02:01:45,984 --> 02:01:48,288
I want you to please

2352
02:01:48,544 --> 02:01:50,592
Speculate and make people afraid

2353
02:01:50,848 --> 02:01:51,360
Please

2354
02:01:51,616 --> 02:01:52,384
Please

2355
02:01:52,640 --> 02:01:56,480
Nobody answer after that like his response being kind of like a giggle is like

2356
02:01:57,504 --> 02:01:58,272
The reason is because

2357
02:01:58,528 --> 02:01:59,808
Love you people like

2358
02:02:00,064 --> 02:02:00,576
You Alex

2359
02:02:01,344 --> 02:02:02,368
Yep

2360
02:02:02,624 --> 02:02:04,160
Why are people more afraid

2361
02:02:04,416 --> 02:02:05,952
Because

2362
02:02:08,512 --> 02:02:12,096
Hour ago on your shell has you were like

2363
02:02:12,352 --> 02:02:13,376
It's going to

2364
02:02:13,632 --> 02:02:19,776
Pause the world temperature to go down when we had connection issues and I was listening to you

2365
02:02:20,032 --> 02:02:22,080
And you said some crazy dumb s***

2366
02:02:24,384 --> 02:02:25,664
The craziest f******

2367
02:02:26,176 --> 02:02:27,712
Yeah because Alex is having

2368
02:02:27,968 --> 02:02:28,992
Such a bad time

2369
02:02:30,016 --> 02:02:33,600
It is not getting his way at all he's got to take this to like

2370
02:02:34,624 --> 02:02:36,416
The craziest level possible

2371
02:02:36,672 --> 02:02:37,440
Just tickets

2372
02:02:40,512 --> 02:02:42,304
YouTube give me something right

2373
02:02:42,816 --> 02:02:48,960
I know you don't

2374
02:02:49,216 --> 02:02:53,824
Causing earthquakes around the world

2375
02:02:55,872 --> 02:02:57,152
I wonder what happened

2376
02:02:57,408 --> 02:03:02,016
Hydrogen bomb went off

2377
02:03:07,904 --> 02:03:12,512
Molten magma

2378
02:03:13,792 --> 02:03:15,328
I suppose it could

2379
02:03:15,584 --> 02:03:16,096
Okay

2380
02:03:17,888 --> 02:03:22,240
You got it.

2381
02:03:22,496 --> 02:03:25,312
Nail tools supposed

2382
02:03:34,016 --> 02:03:38,112
Night forever are you

2383
02:03:38,368 --> 02:03:41,952
This s*** is not working out so hard but he's like

2384
02:03:42,208 --> 02:03:45,792
What if what if what if

2385
02:03:47,584 --> 02:03:52,704
If if we were to Nuke this volcano justify my fear

2386
02:03:52,960 --> 02:03:53,472
That's great

2387
02:03:53,984 --> 02:03:55,264
It would maybe

2388
02:03:58,592 --> 02:03:59,104
Anyway

2389
02:03:59,360 --> 02:04:00,128
I

2390
02:04:00,384 --> 02:04:01,920
Could not love this

2391
02:04:02,176 --> 02:04:04,224
More

2392
02:04:04,736 --> 02:04:05,248
50 Cent

2393
02:04:05,760 --> 02:04:08,832
Alex Jones

2394
02:04:09,088 --> 02:04:09,600
Captivate

2395
02:04:10,368 --> 02:04:10,880
Isn't it

2396
02:04:11,392 --> 02:04:14,464
Like isn't this the Alex Jones that was that was

2397
02:04:14,720 --> 02:04:15,488
Willing to

2398
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:16,768
Be dunked on

2399
02:04:18,304 --> 02:04:19,328
Still pull his neck

2400
02:04:21,888 --> 02:04:22,912
He would never

2401
02:04:23,680 --> 02:04:27,776
I've talked over this would have been yelled over

2402
02:04:28,032 --> 02:04:29,824
There's no way that he would have even

2403
02:04:30,080 --> 02:04:30,592
Finished

2404
02:04:30,848 --> 02:04:31,360
F****** set

2405
02:04:31,872 --> 02:04:33,664
But this 2009 Alec

2406
02:04:34,176 --> 02:04:34,688
He is

2407
02:04:34,944 --> 02:04:36,224
Willing to not just

2408
02:04:36,480 --> 02:04:38,272
Not just listen to this guy

2409
02:04:38,528 --> 02:04:39,552
But like say

2410
02:04:39,808 --> 02:04:42,112
Yep yep

2411
02:04:42,368 --> 02:04:42,880
No

2412
02:04:43,136 --> 02:04:44,416
I get what you're saying

2413
02:04:44,672 --> 02:04:48,000
But I'm pretty

2414
02:04:48,256 --> 02:04:49,536
Have you ever gone to Narnia

2415
02:04:50,048 --> 02:04:51,584
Narnia

2416
02:04:52,096 --> 02:04:52,864
Aslan

2417
02:04:53,120 --> 02:04:54,400
Wasn't around at the time

2418
02:04:54,912 --> 02:04:56,704
Would Yellowstone erupt

2419
02:04:57,472 --> 02:04:58,496
Like it's

2420
02:04:58,752 --> 02:04:59,264
I love this

2421
02:04:59,520 --> 02:05:00,544
I don't know babe cuz

2422
02:05:01,568 --> 02:05:05,152
The song in the 2000s on by

2423
02:05:05,408 --> 02:05:06,688
Yeah great so hard

2424
02:05:06,944 --> 02:05:08,480
Great stuff

2425
02:05:12,320 --> 02:05:12,832
Episode

2426
02:05:13,856 --> 02:05:15,136
Three out of four interviews

2427
02:05:18,976 --> 02:05:21,280
No the other two days use able to like

2428
02:05:21,792 --> 02:05:23,072
Spin out of it and be like

2429
02:05:27,168 --> 02:05:29,216
Write this out of it

2430
02:05:29,728 --> 02:05:33,056
Embarrassing goes on an hour and it keeps to being like

2431
02:05:33,312 --> 02:05:34,848
Well what about if we nuked

2432
02:05:35,104 --> 02:05:37,408
The only Rose to that

2433
02:05:37,664 --> 02:05:38,432
Bad on air

2434
02:05:39,200 --> 02:05:41,504
It doesn't really matter though because

2435
02:05:42,016 --> 02:05:43,040
But honestly

2436
02:05:43,296 --> 02:05:47,648
I'm just a big fan of especially

2437
02:05:48,160 --> 02:05:49,184
Also

2438
02:05:49,440 --> 02:05:50,720
I was trained as a

2439
02:05:50,976 --> 02:05:51,488
Astronomer

2440
02:05:52,256 --> 02:05:53,536
So

2441
02:05:53,792 --> 02:05:56,608
Smart like a million different

2442
02:05:56,864 --> 02:05:57,888
He's not even saying

2443
02:05:58,912 --> 02:06:00,192
But

2444
02:06:00,448 --> 02:06:00,960
Clear

2445
02:06:01,216 --> 02:06:02,240
Text is like

2446
02:06:02,752 --> 02:06:04,032
I'm going to explain

2447
02:06:05,056 --> 02:06:05,824
Like I would

2448
02:06:06,336 --> 02:06:06,848
Child

2449
02:06:07,616 --> 02:06:08,384
Exactly what

2450
02:06:08,896 --> 02:06:10,432
You notice that this volcanology

2451
02:06:11,456 --> 02:06:11,968
I've read

2452
02:06:12,224 --> 02:06:13,504
60 books about volcanoes

2453
02:06:13,760 --> 02:06:14,272
He's so

2454
02:06:14,784 --> 02:06:16,064
Ancient

2455
02:06:16,832 --> 02:06:19,904
Installers trying to make sure that Alex

2456
02:06:20,160 --> 02:06:21,696
And Alex's listeners

2457
02:06:21,952 --> 02:06:22,720
Knows it

2458
02:06:23,232 --> 02:06:24,512
In all honesty

2459
02:06:25,024 --> 02:06:25,792
It's not that big

2460
02:06:27,072 --> 02:06:28,096
So this is

2461
02:06:28,352 --> 02:06:29,376
Boast of

2462
02:06:30,912 --> 02:06:31,424
Fun

2463
02:06:31,680 --> 02:06:33,216
About February 4th and 5th

2464
02:06:33,472 --> 02:06:33,984
AimPoint

2465
02:06:34,240 --> 02:06:34,752
2000

2466
02:06:35,008 --> 02:06:37,056
Close

2467
02:06:37,312 --> 02:06:37,824
3

2468
02:06:38,336 --> 02:06:39,104
Alright

2469
02:06:39,360 --> 02:06:40,640
That our batting cleanup

2470
02:06:41,152 --> 02:06:41,664
Alright

2471
02:06:41,920 --> 02:06:43,456
Some of it really terrible

2472
02:06:43,712 --> 02:06:44,224
Some of it

2473
02:06:44,736 --> 02:06:45,504
Find Target

2474
02:06:45,760 --> 02:06:46,784
Nothing good

2475
02:06:47,040 --> 02:06:48,064
Alright

2476
02:06:48,320 --> 02:06:49,600
February 5th

2477
02:06:49,856 --> 02:06:52,160
Alex has an interview with a guy named Aaron zelman

2478
02:06:52,672 --> 02:06:54,976
Who's the president of the Jews

2479
02:06:55,488 --> 02:06:56,000
Gun

2480
02:06:56,256 --> 02:06:57,024
Preservation rate

2481
02:06:57,280 --> 02:06:59,840
Run right preservation

2482
02:07:00,096 --> 02:07:00,608
Sure

2483
02:07:00,864 --> 02:07:02,400
I didn't know there was a group

2484
02:07:06,496 --> 02:07:08,800
I don't exist anymore I have no idea

2485
02:07:09,056 --> 02:07:11,360
It might just be Aaron zelman

2486
02:07:11,616 --> 02:07:14,432
I have no idea where this organization is

2487
02:07:14,688 --> 02:07:16,992
I would say

2488
02:07:17,248 --> 02:07:18,272
Interviewed

2489
02:07:18,528 --> 02:07:19,296
Not go great

2490
02:07:19,808 --> 02:07:21,088
Cuz here's how it starts

2491
02:07:21,856 --> 02:07:23,392
But you are right about a tires

2492
02:07:23,648 --> 02:07:24,928
Situation we are face

2493
02:07:25,184 --> 02:07:25,696
Weather

2494
02:07:26,976 --> 02:07:27,744
War

2495
02:07:28,000 --> 02:07:30,048
I literally War I war on gun owners

2496
02:07:30,560 --> 02:07:31,840
By the government

2497
02:07:34,656 --> 02:07:37,472
A mission that could cost the United States

2498
02:07:37,728 --> 02:07:38,752
Final solution

2499
02:07:39,264 --> 02:07:41,824
Second Amendment I'm not trying to be funny

2500
02:07:42,336 --> 02:07:44,128
You are kind of trying to be funny

2501
02:07:44,384 --> 02:07:49,248
Hey hey guy you love it and I love it

2502
02:07:52,832 --> 02:07:53,600
But for guns

2503
02:07:54,112 --> 02:07:55,904
So it's bad

2504
02:07:56,672 --> 02:07:57,440
Is it bad

2505
02:07:58,208 --> 02:08:00,000
If we had a holocaust for guns

2506
02:08:01,536 --> 02:08:03,072
I like legitimately

2507
02:08:03,840 --> 02:08:04,608
I'm one of these dudes

2508
02:08:04,864 --> 02:08:06,144
She doesn't really get mad about

2509
02:08:06,400 --> 02:08:07,168
Stuff yeah

2510
02:08:07,424 --> 02:08:08,960
I'm not I'm not

2511
02:08:09,216 --> 02:08:12,288
I know I'm pretty chill generally in terms of like

2512
02:08:12,544 --> 02:08:14,848
Unless you talk bad about Michelle Branch

2513
02:08:16,896 --> 02:08:18,688
Britney Spears has back to the Brittany

2514
02:08:18,944 --> 02:08:20,992
Generally I'm pretty chill

2515
02:08:21,504 --> 02:08:22,784
For me which

2516
02:08:23,040 --> 02:08:26,624
Weird underpinning to this entire episode or Mandy Moore

2517
02:08:26,880 --> 02:08:27,392
Is r

2518
02:08:27,904 --> 02:08:29,440
Episode

2519
02:08:29,696 --> 02:08:31,232
Argument about Britney Spears

2520
02:08:35,328 --> 02:08:36,864
I'm pretty

2521
02:08:37,120 --> 02:08:37,632
Cool

2522
02:08:37,888 --> 02:08:39,168
About stuff generally

2523
02:08:39,424 --> 02:08:40,704
It really makes

2524
02:08:41,728 --> 02:08:42,240
Pretty man

2525
02:08:43,264 --> 02:08:43,776
Like

2526
02:08:44,544 --> 02:08:45,824
I do I don't know

2527
02:08:46,848 --> 02:08:48,128
I'm not Jewish

2528
02:08:48,384 --> 02:08:49,408
I'm not naturally

2529
02:08:49,664 --> 02:08:51,456
I have empathy for

2530
02:08:51,712 --> 02:08:52,480
Jewish people

2531
02:08:52,736 --> 02:08:54,272
Yeah I have an anger

2532
02:08:54,528 --> 02:08:55,552
The Israeli government

2533
02:08:56,576 --> 02:08:59,136
I think those parts

2534
02:08:59,392 --> 02:09:00,160
Occupy the same

2535
02:09:00,416 --> 02:09:01,696
Generally speaking

2536
02:09:03,744 --> 02:09:04,768
I'm furious

2537
02:09:05,280 --> 02:09:07,328
When I hear someone be like

2538
02:09:08,096 --> 02:09:10,400
This is the final solution about

2539
02:09:10,656 --> 02:09:11,424
Gun

2540
02:09:11,936 --> 02:09:13,472
The guy who runs

2541
02:09:13,984 --> 02:09:17,824
Jews for gun right preservation red

2542
02:09:18,336 --> 02:09:20,384
I'm not trying to be funny

2543
02:09:20,640 --> 02:09:22,176
First of all as a comedian

2544
02:09:22,432 --> 02:09:28,064
A pastor a former comedian

2545
02:09:28,320 --> 02:09:28,832
Second

2546
02:09:29,344 --> 02:09:31,392
The only way you're going to

2547
02:09:31,648 --> 02:09:32,160
Make that

2548
02:09:33,440 --> 02:09:33,952
Talking

2549
02:09:34,208 --> 02:09:34,976
Awful jokes

2550
02:09:35,232 --> 02:09:35,744
Yeah

2551
02:09:36,000 --> 02:09:39,328
Is if you really don't think the Holocaust happen

2552
02:09:40,096 --> 02:09:42,400
Or you'd think it was that big a deal

2553
02:09:42,912 --> 02:09:43,936
Per unit used

2554
02:09:44,192 --> 02:09:46,496
Term final solution

2555
02:09:47,264 --> 02:09:49,056
As a way to poke like

2556
02:09:49,312 --> 02:09:51,872
Hey yours these people trying to take our guns

2557
02:09:53,664 --> 02:09:57,760
You still have your guns now 10 years later dumbass

2558
02:09:58,016 --> 02:10:00,320
The only way you can use that language

2559
02:10:00,832 --> 02:10:01,856
Is it either

2560
02:10:02,624 --> 02:10:05,184
You don't think the Holocaust was that big a deal

2561
02:10:05,440 --> 02:10:06,720
And the final solution is

2562
02:10:06,976 --> 02:10:08,000
Not something that

2563
02:10:08,256 --> 02:10:11,840
Jews should really be triggered by right or

2564
02:10:13,376 --> 02:10:14,912
You got to want to wake up nauseous

2565
02:10:15,168 --> 02:10:19,008
Yeah

2566
02:10:19,264 --> 02:10:24,128
Not okay but I just have to ask you the question

2567
02:10:25,408 --> 02:10:26,688
I mean ultimately

2568
02:10:27,200 --> 02:10:28,992
What is your final solution to this

2569
02:10:40,768 --> 02:10:43,328
Asking what is your final solution

2570
02:10:44,608 --> 02:10:45,120
Is not good

2571
02:10:45,376 --> 02:10:49,984
I don't like it I wish I didn't have to do it but I had to do it the joke was there

2572
02:10:50,240 --> 02:10:50,752
But it's

2573
02:10:53,312 --> 02:10:53,824
That

2574
02:10:54,080 --> 02:10:54,848
Is better

2575
02:10:55,104 --> 02:10:55,616
Benson

2576
02:10:56,128 --> 02:10:57,920
This is the final solution

2577
02:10:58,176 --> 02:10:59,968
Well because I was trying very

2578
02:11:00,224 --> 02:11:01,248
Specifically to be fun

2579
02:11:06,112 --> 02:11:11,488
Avila's re-air until 1 but I'm addict

2580
02:11:12,000 --> 02:11:12,768
I apologize

2581
02:11:13,024 --> 02:11:14,304
But this also should

2582
02:11:14,560 --> 02:11:15,072
Indica flower

2583
02:11:15,328 --> 02:11:16,096
This should indicate

2584
02:11:16,352 --> 02:11:17,632
To you a little bit about

2585
02:11:17,888 --> 02:11:19,424
Again 2009 Alex

2586
02:11:19,680 --> 02:11:20,704
Texas versus press

2587
02:11:21,216 --> 02:11:21,984
Right Alex

2588
02:11:22,752 --> 02:11:23,520
Present day

2589
02:11:23,776 --> 02:11:24,544
Lorde

2590
02:11:24,800 --> 02:11:27,360
2015 to present that we've listened to

2591
02:11:27,616 --> 02:11:28,640
Don't bring up the

2592
02:11:28,896 --> 02:11:31,712
Jews for the preservation of the Second Amendment

2593
02:11:31,968 --> 02:11:34,528
Maybe that's

2594
02:11:34,784 --> 02:11:36,832
Piece of his world

2595
02:11:38,112 --> 02:11:39,648
And Larry Pratt

2596
02:11:39,904 --> 02:11:41,952
Gunownersofamerica

2597
02:11:42,208 --> 02:11:42,976
Vouched for it

2598
02:11:43,232 --> 02:11:45,792
2009

2599
02:11:46,048 --> 02:11:48,096
I hated the NRA back then loves them

2600
02:11:52,192 --> 02:11:53,216
Weird

2601
02:11:54,240 --> 02:11:54,752
Next

2602
02:11:55,520 --> 02:11:56,032
That's all I'll say about

2603
02:11:56,544 --> 02:11:58,592
You're a nice gross

2604
02:11:58,848 --> 02:11:59,360
Clip

2605
02:11:59,872 --> 02:12:00,384
Is it

2606
02:12:08,576 --> 02:12:09,344
Very

2607
02:12:09,600 --> 02:12:11,136
Different story than what he's about to

2608
02:12:11,392 --> 02:12:12,416
Directions

2609
02:12:12,672 --> 02:12:13,952
By the way this is confirmed

2610
02:12:14,464 --> 02:12:19,584
No judge

2611
02:12:20,096 --> 02:12:22,912
There is real chocolate

2612
02:12:36,736 --> 02:12:41,600
Letters

2613
02:12:44,928 --> 02:12:47,232
I'm here always

2614
02:13:16,160 --> 02:13:17,696
Pepsi

2615
02:13:26,400 --> 02:13:28,960
For me that's just the same impression he did

2616
02:13:30,240 --> 02:13:30,752
An hour and a half

2617
02:13:33,568 --> 02:13:34,080
Second

2618
02:13:35,616 --> 02:13:36,640
In the context

2619
02:13:37,920 --> 02:13:38,432
Today

2620
02:13:42,784 --> 02:13:43,296
Sake

2621
02:13:44,320 --> 02:13:46,368
That's my version of you doing

2622
02:13:46,880 --> 02:13:48,928
Dismissive

2623
02:13:49,184 --> 02:13:50,208
Scampi

2624
02:13:50,976 --> 02:13:51,488
I just

2625
02:13:52,000 --> 02:13:52,512
It is this

2626
02:13:52,768 --> 02:13:53,792
Gibril

2627
02:13:54,048 --> 02:13:57,376
For the kids

2628
02:13:57,632 --> 02:13:58,656
This turned

2629
02:13:58,912 --> 02:14:00,192
Did this this nightmares

2630
02:14:05,056 --> 02:14:06,080
No no

2631
02:14:06,592 --> 02:14:07,360
Come real

2632
02:14:07,616 --> 02:14:10,432
Aren't we supposed to

2633
02:14:10,688 --> 02:14:11,200
When you

2634
02:14:11,456 --> 02:14:12,224
Look at Alec

2635
02:14:12,736 --> 02:14:14,528
Is bullshitters

2636
02:14:14,784 --> 02:14:15,552
You look at his

2637
02:14:15,808 --> 02:14:16,576
You're so

2638
02:14:16,832 --> 02:14:18,624
Being nightmare in 2009

2639
02:14:18,880 --> 02:14:20,160
Where you laugh at it

2640
02:14:20,416 --> 02:14:21,184
And you say this

2641
02:14:21,696 --> 02:14:23,232
Never happened and then you look at it

2642
02:14:23,744 --> 02:14:25,024
The present-day and it's

2643
02:14:25,280 --> 02:14:26,304
F****** real

2644
02:14:26,560 --> 02:14:27,584
And none of us

2645
02:14:27,840 --> 02:14:29,120

Psych

2663
02:15:04,448 --> 02:15:05,472
It was more about the

2664
02:15:05,984 --> 02:15:06,752
Cops killed

2665
02:15:07,008 --> 02:15:08,032

The guy who directed loose change

2676

In there

2695
02:16:26,112 --> 02:16:26,624

02:16:28,160 --> 02:16:28,672
I don't give a

2697
02:16:31,488 --> 02:16:32,256
Here's why this

2698
02:16:33,280 --> 02:16:34,048
He says some

2699
02:16:40,192 --> 02:16:41,472

Coming out of his mouth

2702
02:16:44,800 --> 02:16:45,312
I don't think Alex

2703
02:16:45,824 --> 02:16:46,336
If you listen to

2704
02:16:46,848 --> 02:16:47,360
I don't think he'd under

2705
02:16:48,128 --> 02:16:48,640
How

2706
02:16:49,408 --> 02:16:49,920
Crazy with

2707
02:16:50,944 --> 02:16:52,992
We're doing what feels right and that is expanding

2708
02:16:59,648 --> 02:17:05,792
Neighbors are friends and family first

2709
02:17:06,048 --> 02:17:07,072
Information

2710
02:17:09,376 --> 02:17:13,984
Absolutely

2711
02:17:14,752 --> 02:17:15,264
So like

2712
02:17:16,288 --> 02:17:17,312
Did you understand what happened

2713
02:17:18,336 --> 02:17:20,896
Yeah

2714
02:17:21,664 --> 02:17:23,200
Ted Anderson is buying

2715
02:17:23,456 --> 02:17:24,224

B on a competing Network

2725
02:17:51,360 --> 02:17:53,664
At the same time live as him

2726
02:17:53,920 --> 02:17:55,200
He would never do that

2727
02:17:55,456 --> 02:17:57,504
Who's playing these guys

2728
02:17:58,016 --> 02:18:00,064
Because Ted Anderson

2729
02:18:00,576 --> 02:18:01,856

2730
02:18:02,112 --> 02:18:03,136

All his gold resources

2737
02:18:11,072 --> 02:18:13,120
Because it was two separate businesses

2738
02:18:13,376 --> 02:18:15,936
It never really seemed like all that much of a trouble

2739
02:18:16,448 --> 02:18:17,728
So all of these shows

2740
02:18:17,984 --> 02:18:19,264

From Midas resources to sell gold

2749
02:18:35,904 --> 02:18:37,184
But you know what he wasn't trying to

2750
02:18:37,440 --> 02:18:37,952
To do

2751
02:18:38,208 --> 02:18:38,976

Because I was the most

2759
02:18:51,264 --> 02:18:52,544

You don't know that he didn't

2776
02:19:22,496 --> 02:19:23,008
That's true

2777
02:19:23,264 --> 02:19:24,288
No right

2778
02:19:24,544 --> 02:19:28,640
I didn't know that

2779
02:19:29,152 --> 02:19:29,664

Guys

2782
02:19:33,504 --> 02:19:34,016
This isn't fair

2783
02:19:34,528 --> 02:19:35,808
Like the idea of fit

2784
02:19:36,064 --> 02:19:36,832
Jason bermas

2785
02:19:37,088 --> 02:19:37,600

Like

2792
02:19:51,936 --> 02:19:53,216
If Ted Anderson is

2793
02:19:53,472 --> 02:19:54,496
The sponsor of fire show

2794
02:19:55,008 --> 02:19:56,800
And at the same time

2795
02:19:57,056 --> 02:19:58,080
What is the sponsor of

And of Glenn Beck

2798
02:20:00,896 --> 02:20:02,688
That gives us the legitimacy

2799
02:20:03,712 --> 02:20:05,248
The concept

2800
02:20:05,504 --> 02:20:06,528

That's going to bring us some money

2806
02:20:22,656 --> 02:20:23,424
He thinks

2807
02:20:23,936 --> 02:20:24,704
Anderson

2808
02:20:25,216 --> 02:20:25,984
