4
00:00:18,688 --> 00:00:20,992
How was your first experiment experience with

5
00:00:21,248 --> 00:00:21,760
Pandemic

6
00:00:22,016 --> 00:00:26,624
Play the other night you just got a grill

7
00:00:29,952 --> 00:00:30,720
Delightful burgers

8
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:39,424
Equitably was very widely recommended by our listeners

9
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:44,800
Jay-Z and

10
00:00:45,056 --> 00:00:46,848
I don't know why we lost

11
00:00:47,104 --> 00:00:49,920
I think that was part of

12
00:00:50,176 --> 00:00:51,712
The learning curve though

13
00:00:52,224 --> 00:00:55,040
We are just taking it out of the box figuring out how to play

14
00:00:55,296 --> 00:00:55,808
You're going to lose

15
00:00:56,832 --> 00:00:57,600
I got to

16
00:00:58,112 --> 00:00:59,392
Self-conscious

17
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:05,792
Not feel like you're kind of dumb

18
00:01:06,048 --> 00:01:06,816
Yeah you know

19
00:01:07,072 --> 00:01:08,864
I lost you

20
00:01:10,144 --> 00:01:14,752
We lost because of the timer

21
00:01:16,032 --> 00:01:17,312
And the built-in

22
00:01:17,568 --> 00:01:19,872
We could have won if we had more time

23
00:01:20,128 --> 00:01:26,272
That's how the world is going to climate change kills us all

24
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:45,984
I know a lot about Alex Jones

25
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:52,640
Indeed we got episode 2

26
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:58,016
Dudes from qanon anonymous

27
00:01:58,784 --> 00:02:00,832
And perhaps

28
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:03,392
Thank you to everybody who was all the positive

29
00:02:03,904 --> 00:02:10,048
Departure from our format worried about the idea of how it was

30
00:02:10,304 --> 00:02:13,888

Jordans

34
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:27,968
The present-day that Monday was that

35
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:29,248
Present present

36
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,576
Take that rule this week

37
00:02:32,832 --> 00:02:38,464
What present-day episodes one of the things I strive to do is be close to current as possible

38
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,000
Going to cover things that are

39
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:43,840
I want it

40
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:45,120
Do that

41
00:02:46,912 --> 00:02:49,728
Because I started covering Wednesday May 8th

42
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:51,264
Yeah and I realized

43
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:54,848
It's all episode

44
00:02:55,104 --> 00:02:55,616
But there was

45
00:02:55,872 --> 00:02:58,176
Much going on on it

46
00:02:58,432 --> 00:03:00,736
I couldn't leave this uncovered

47
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:07,648
Sounds good

Somebody donated an elevated level

59
00:03:39,392 --> 00:03:43,232

Wednesday

64
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:32,895
I forgot what

65
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:39,295
Jose

66
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:41,855
Inconsiderate

67
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:47,743
So maybe this is the best present you can possibly ask

68
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:49,279
What was the first

69
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:52,095
Half hour 40 minutes

70
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:55,423
Very depressed

71
00:04:55,935 --> 00:05:00,543
Clinical depression level symptoms

72
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:02,079
Just heard of a cross-section

73
00:05:03,871 --> 00:05:05,407
Embodies

74
00:05:05,663 --> 00:05:06,431
Depressed vibe

75
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:13,343
Here's what's happening

76
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:14,623
Yeah Michelle right now

77
00:05:15,391 --> 00:05:21,279
Because things are so bad this country I think talking about it is he's almost a way of just making it a four-wheeler chain

78
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:24,607
I really really really do.

79
00:05:25,887 --> 00:05:28,191
We have to do some really really drastic things

80
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:32,287
Did you see in person

81
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:38,175
I wouldn't got to run about a restaurant that wouldn't try to do what the Democrats

82
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:40,479
I would I would definitely let them know

83
00:05:40,735 --> 00:05:44,063
I thought you were aware of their criminal activity

84
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:51,743
You can do anything

85
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:54,559
If you can do anything to let these criminals

86
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:56,607
Because they're consolidating power

87
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:59,167
Worse by the day

88
00:05:59,679 --> 00:06:05,823
Fatalistic Elementary

89
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:06,847
I'm not doing it

90
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:10,431
Like whatever

91
00:06:12,223 --> 00:06:14,783
Well it's kind of him showing his cards

92
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:21,183
Coming around to the position of like whatever I'm doing isn't

93
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:25,023
Do get sued a lot right now

94
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:27,071
Is this Justice

95
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:31,679
Super weird vibe I don't think that clip fully bodies

96
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:33,471
Those parts were there just like

97
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:34,495
Frequent

98
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:36,031
4-second pauses

99
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:37,055
Where he's just like

100
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:42,175
Are you going to see you again

101
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:43,199
I don't know what

102
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:52,415
It's sucked out of him

103
00:06:53,695 --> 00:06:55,743
Is going on here I don't even know what I

104
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:58,303
I need any more do I want guns

105
00:06:58,559 --> 00:06:59,071
I had

106
00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:00,607
So many theories

107
00:07:00,863 --> 00:07:05,215
Could possibly be going on

108
00:07:05,471 --> 00:07:06,751
You don't need to have Siri

109
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:09,055
He will just tell you

110
00:07:09,311 --> 00:07:11,615
Opening 20 minutes

111
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:14,687
You did watch something

112
00:07:15,711 --> 00:07:19,295
You know I got the vibe that he was really depressed and it's something must be up

113
00:07:19,551 --> 00:07:22,623
Good friend

114
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:27,743
About 40 minutes and he let us know exactly what's going on

115
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:28,767
And what has caused

116
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:30,047
Will to live

117
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:31,327
What time

118
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:37,215
Last night it was exactly what I thought it would be

119
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:40,543
At this point I thought it was Avengers endgame

120
00:07:40,799 --> 00:07:42,847
Thought like

121
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:45,919
Pizza Avengers and it's the only thing

122
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:47,711
I thought that was for sure it

123
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:48,991
It's a little more

124
00:07:50,015 --> 00:07:50,783
And worse

125
00:07:52,575 --> 00:07:55,647
So incredibly boring show incredible today

126
00:07:56,415 --> 00:08:02,559
So pathetic

127
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:08,959
Eclipse

128
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:12,543
I thought for sure

129
00:08:12,799 --> 00:08:15,359
It is not engaging all right what it is

130
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:17,919
The people so weak

131
00:08:18,943 --> 00:08:20,479
And so soulless

132
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:25,343
I thought

133
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:29,439
Following in the real world

134
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:33,535
Forsaken ism

135
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:39,935
Nasm CPT

136
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:46,335
You can get around something about Loki or

137
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:54,015
Actual devil worshippers

138
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:58,111
And that they see themselves as their food

139
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:05,535
I just thank God I'm out those people

140
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:09,887
Chicken around me

141
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:11,423
Watching their enjoyment

142
00:09:14,239 --> 00:09:15,263
Was

143
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:16,287
Soul-sucking

144
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:21,919
The wash

145
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:22,943
And

146
00:09:23,455 --> 00:09:26,271
Is the movie hail Satan

147
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:32,671
Waited just called hail Satan documentary about the satanic temple

148
00:09:32,927 --> 00:09:35,743
Farcical a little bit

149
00:09:35,999 --> 00:09:38,047
Are you going to get into it later in the episode

150
00:09:38,303 --> 00:09:41,119
We'll talk about it but

151
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:42,143
Hail Satan

152
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:44,191
Documentary

153
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:47,007
Wheatley destroyed the beginning of his broadcast

154
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:54,175
That was my first question what are you go

155
00:09:54,431 --> 00:09:56,479
From this

156
00:09:59,295 --> 00:10:05,439
I don't think he allowed his kids to go put on a false nose and glasses

157
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:11,839
Mustache incognito

158
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:20,031
You seen the movie you probably drinking well

159
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:26,431
The baby this depression that is manifesting it's just a hangover

160
00:10:26,687 --> 00:10:27,967
Mister put in a good light

161
00:10:28,223 --> 00:10:31,039
Call dependent

162
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:34,623
The possibilities are there like you saw Satanist

163
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:35,903
Senna documentary

164
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:37,439
Ergo

165
00:10:37,695 --> 00:10:40,255
Losing the will to live

166
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:42,047
Listen to documentary 323

167
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:44,095
A little sloppy the next morning all there

168
00:10:45,119 --> 00:10:47,679
Long pauses between words

169
00:10:47,935 --> 00:10:49,215
Equally

170
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:53,311
He sees this documentary and he goes on

171
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:56,127
About how's the Satanist

172
00:10:56,383 --> 00:10:57,663
There are Lowdown

173
00:10:57,919 --> 00:10:58,687
Brokeback

174
00:10:59,455 --> 00:11:00,479
Soul sucked

175
00:11:00,735 --> 00:11:03,807
Is normal satanic imagery

176
00:11:04,063 --> 00:11:06,367
That's all the people in the audience

177
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:07,391
Penney's

178
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:08,415
Specifically take

179
00:11:08,927 --> 00:11:09,951
A lot of those ideas

180
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:11,487
Putting on to

181
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:12,255
To the Satanist

182
00:11:12,511 --> 00:11:13,791
And you'll see very clearly in this

183
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:15,071
40 dozen

184
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:16,607
He takes little characterization

185
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:17,887
And applies them

186
00:11:18,143 --> 00:11:18,655
The Democrats

187
00:11:18,911 --> 00:11:24,287
In order to conflates miss the Democratic

188
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:25,311
Somebody's doing that

189
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:29,407
I can tell you're not just here but in many other areas

190
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:32,479
The actual operating system

191
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:37,855
Like a computer program like Windows

192
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:39,135
2000

193
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:43,231
Party

194
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:47,327
I remember

195
00:11:49,119 --> 00:11:53,727
Air Force generals tell him that 2017

196
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:55,519
I remember

197
00:11:56,287 --> 00:11:59,871
Dallas wealthy area

198
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:00,895
Reborn

199
00:12:01,663 --> 00:12:07,807
White trash 84 message

200
00:12:08,831 --> 00:12:11,135
Wait a second I got to pause there for a second

201
00:12:11,391 --> 00:12:11,903
Alex

202
00:12:29,311 --> 00:12:31,615
Like his whole brand proposition is

203
00:12:31,871 --> 00:12:34,431
Defense of attacks on white people

204
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:36,223
And white trashes one of the

205
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:38,015
Most derisively

206
00:12:38,271 --> 00:12:39,551
About poor white people

207
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:43,391
Completely in congruous with someone

208
00:12:43,903 --> 00:12:46,719
With the market share that Alex does

209
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:48,767
Would be okay with like

210
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:52,607
Throwing that around to insult some other white people

211
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:59,007
Depressed you know your filters are away at their lowest

212
00:12:59,263 --> 00:13:05,407
Directions

213
00:13:08,735 --> 00:13:11,039
What do they have left

214
00:13:13,087 --> 00:13:16,159
But even though I was surrounded I still

215
00:13:18,719 --> 00:13:20,767
Couldn't believe that it was his lamp

216
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:32,799
I meant to write some notes last night when I got my number today

217
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:34,335
Washing

218
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:39,199
Hail Satan mystery movie

219
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:44,575
That's the Democrats

220
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:45,855
First 5 minutes

221
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:47,391
Oh my gosh

222
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:53,535
Operating system

223
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:56,863
There shall be Democrats

224
00:13:58,143 --> 00:14:00,447
Images

225
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:03,007
So

226
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:05,311
Very strong

227
00:14:05,567 --> 00:14:06,847
Siri is 2y

228
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:07,871
He sees

229
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:08,639
The Satanist

230
00:14:08,895 --> 00:14:11,711
Send the documentary and he says oh my God it's the Democrat

231
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:14,783
I have

232
00:14:17,087 --> 00:14:19,647
I want to say like the depression that he was manifesting

233
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:20,671
Episode

234
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:27,071
Kind of made me feel a little bit gross and sad

235
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:30,399
And that's what's causing

236
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:35,263
The previous night for this episode he gone to the old Cinema

237
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:36,799
18 the documentary hail Satan

238
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:37,567
Which

239
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:40,895
I mean the first question you had is the first question anyone has

240
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:47,039
Which is why the f*** would you go and do that

241
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:53,439
What if what if

242
00:14:53,695 --> 00:14:55,743
Exactly what

243
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:57,279
It's gratifying in Subway

244
00:14:57,535 --> 00:14:59,071
You can't just get that same charge

245
00:14:59,327 --> 00:15:05,471
From Reading like a book by my uncle who wrote books

246
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:08,031
Uncle would be more than enough for him to

247
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:17,503
Wrote a number of books about multiple personality disorder and how it's caused by

248
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:31,327
Luminary

249
00:15:33,887 --> 00:15:37,215
See this movie this documentary that Alex

250
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:39,775
Really pretty interesting and I would be

251
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:43,615
The story of the movie

252
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:48,223
Documentary follows a group of people who advocate for marginalized groups

253
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:49,503
And particularly against

254
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:50,527
Depression that comes

255
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:51,295
Disguised

256
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:52,319
Christian principle

257
00:15:52,831 --> 00:15:54,623
Protecting

258
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:55,647
Separation

259
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:58,975
And they formed this satanic temple in order

260
00:15:59,231 --> 00:15:59,743
The force the issue

261
00:16:00,255 --> 00:16:06,143
Right there be like you're going to erect the Ten Commandments

262
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:12,287
Documentary follows is called the satanic temple

263
00:16:12,543 --> 00:16:14,847
Explicitly don't believe in the Supernatural

264
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:21,247
Is just a metaphor that uses a powerful symbol that they will to get free press and demonstrate how much Christianity

265
00:16:23,295 --> 00:16:25,087
In ways that most people just

266
00:16:25,343 --> 00:16:26,111
Except as the default

267
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:29,183
For instance in 2013 they held a rally

268
00:16:29,439 --> 00:16:35,327
Does Port Florida Governor Rick Scott's Bill 98 which allow children to pray at school

269
00:16:36,607 --> 00:16:41,215
They specifically to illustrate that the film

270
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:44,031
The school would have to let them

271
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:45,823
They were using tulip people

272
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:46,847
Response to Satan

273
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:48,895
As a way of highlighting

274
00:16:49,151 --> 00:16:53,247
You know you're probably not cool with the idea of satanic prayer in school and possibly

275
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:54,783
Maybe someone else might have

276
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:56,575
Be cool with any prayer in school

277
00:16:57,087 --> 00:16:58,879
They're using that as a lightning rod

278
00:16:59,135 --> 00:17:00,927
To get you to understand what your ex

279
00:17:01,439 --> 00:17:02,719
Appear like

280
00:17:04,767 --> 00:17:05,279
Bright

281
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:08,351
They've used the church to launch a number of purely social advocate

282
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:11,935
Started protect children project

283
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:15,519
What's the sign up on the website if their child goes to

284
00:17:15,775 --> 00:17:17,311
Two schools that uses corporal punishment

285
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:19,359
Or prolonged isolation as

286
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:20,639
Fractions

287
00:17:21,151 --> 00:17:21,919
After the parents Reggie

288
00:17:22,175 --> 00:17:23,199
Destroyed the temple contacts

289
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:24,735
School

290
00:17:24,991 --> 00:17:26,271
Using her violation

291
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:27,551
Religious principles

292
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:29,343
And post a challenge to the practice

293
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:30,367
As a way

294
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:34,207
The religious principle deer

295
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:39,327
That you are a yourquote body is inviolable

296
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:41,631
And subject only to one's own will

297
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:44,191
We just hope they can also be used for

298
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:44,959
Provide religious

299
00:17:45,215 --> 00:17:45,727
Is exemption

300
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:48,287
You purely religiously-based abortion laws

301
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:49,823
Buzz Missouri

302
00:17:50,591 --> 00:17:51,871
The Advocate

303
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:54,175
There were little

304
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:55,711
Little bit

305
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:56,479
PR stunt

306
00:17:56,991 --> 00:18:01,855
Like when they married a gay and lesbian couple on top of Fred Phelps mother's grave

307
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:04,159
Pretty fun

308
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:06,463
The little bit

309
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:07,743
Tasteless

310
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:10,303
Make a little hilarious

311
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:12,095
It's it's on the

312
00:18:12,351 --> 00:18:13,119
More

313
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:16,959
PR focused and of it

314
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:19,263
Teabagging

315
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:25,919
And maybe I'm more important.

316
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:27,199
Confrontational

317
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:28,991
I'm not on that side of things

318
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:30,783
The satanic temple

319
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:34,367
Who after Oklahoma State Representative

320
00:18:34,623 --> 00:18:35,903
Planter

321
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:37,439
Ten Commandments

322
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:40,767
Insisted that that method

323
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:42,303
They didn't

324
00:18:44,351 --> 00:18:44,863
State Capitol

325
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:49,215
They only wanted to illustrate why

326
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:49,983
And it work

327
00:18:50,751 --> 00:18:53,567
The case Prescott vs. Oklahoma Capitol preservation

328
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:56,383
Ended up getting rid of the Ten Commandments

329
00:19:00,991 --> 00:19:04,063
When Arkansas plan to put up

330
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:05,087
Misty brought back

331
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:07,391
Statue in the process of

332
00:19:07,647 --> 00:19:08,159
What you got 12

333
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:10,975
The point they were driving at is very clear

334
00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:13,791
It's basically high-concept social Progressive

335
00:19:14,047 --> 00:19:16,351
Trolling under the guise of using Satan

336
00:19:17,631 --> 00:19:20,959
Hakeem

337
00:19:21,215 --> 00:19:23,263
Liberal

338
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:28,127
Members of the group don't even really have to be Satanist

339
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:30,943
To join the church as one of their New York members explained

340
00:19:31,199 --> 00:19:33,247
You don't even have to be a Satanist

341
00:19:33,503 --> 00:19:39,135
You couldn't be a strong Ally who believes in the political and secular actions without being super stoked about all the aphetic

342
00:19:40,415 --> 00:19:40,927
So

343
00:19:41,183 --> 00:19:42,975
I get what they're doing

344
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:45,535
Does f*** with ripe

345
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:47,583
Write using a lot of their tools again

346
00:19:50,143 --> 00:19:53,215
Pretty much everything the satanic temple doesn't specifically about protecting

347
00:19:53,471 --> 00:19:54,495
The division of church and state

348
00:19:54,751 --> 00:19:57,311
Vulnerable communities

349
00:19:57,823 --> 00:19:58,335
Community

350
00:19:58,591 --> 00:20:01,407
Immigrant Planned Parenthood employees orchids

351
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:02,431
Get hit in school

352
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:08,063
Don't know everything about the group but from everything I can tell while my personal taste

353
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:08,831
Over some of them

354
00:20:10,111 --> 00:20:11,903
It seems like you're doing important work

355
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:13,439
And are pretty effective

356
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:16,255
Well I'm inconsiderate

357
00:20:17,535 --> 00:20:18,559
Almost certainly

358
00:20:20,863 --> 00:20:22,655
Unconstitutional Georgia abortion

359
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:26,239
If you're going to have a religion

360
00:20:26,751 --> 00:20:27,263
Exemption law

361
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:28,031
4

362
00:20:30,591 --> 00:20:33,919
Hospital nurse refusing to treat

363
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:35,967
Is there such a religious

364
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:37,247
For that

365
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:40,063
Then almost certainly you can argue in court

366
00:20:40,319 --> 00:20:41,343
That there would be a relief

367
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:43,903
Looking for a Porsche if you were safe

368
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:47,487
Logic tracks religious exemption

369
00:20:49,535 --> 00:20:50,303
You could very easily

370
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:52,351
Mi religion

371
00:20:52,607 --> 00:20:53,375
Specifically

372
00:20:53,631 --> 00:20:57,215
Dictates that I have control over my own body

373
00:20:57,471 --> 00:20:59,775
That night we were federally recognized

374
00:21:00,031 --> 00:21:00,543
Religion

375
00:21:01,055 --> 00:21:07,199
Exempt

376
00:21:11,295 --> 00:21:17,440
I seem like a lot of what they're doing again I'm not going to bat for the organization

377
00:21:17,696 --> 00:21:19,744
I don't know enough about their various chapters and there could be

378
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:29,984
Or whatever the higher-profile biggerstaff that I'm able to

379
00:21:32,032 --> 00:21:33,056
Stuff that I tip my hat to

380
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,360
Just shorted me becoming a

381
00:21:40,992 --> 00:21:41,504
But Alex

382
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:42,528
F****** hate

383
00:21:43,296 --> 00:21:48,672
And he likes to pretend that he hates them because they're low down dirty fools following a little

384
00:21:48,928 --> 00:21:49,696
Persona 5 Lucifer

385
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:53,024
It's pretty clear if you look into what this group does

386
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,072
And if you watch the trailer for the documentary

387
00:21:55,328 --> 00:21:56,096
It's clear

388
00:21:56,352 --> 00:21:57,888
Mostly about their social activist

389
00:22:00,704 --> 00:22:01,472
Escape the

390
00:22:01,728 --> 00:22:03,264
Hates about them is their social

391
00:22:04,544 --> 00:22:06,080
He hates the rent providing

392
00:22:06,336 --> 00:22:07,104
Pretty tough resistance

393
00:22:09,664 --> 00:22:10,432
Pretty into

394
00:22:10,944 --> 00:22:15,040
He hate to pay accept people of all sexual orientations of all identities

395
00:22:15,296 --> 00:22:15,808
And they don't

396
00:22:16,064 --> 00:22:16,832
Anybody is

397
00:22:17,088 --> 00:22:17,600
Is weird

398
00:22:17,856 --> 00:22:19,392
He hates take the protection

399
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:20,672
His religion is a

400
00:22:20,928 --> 00:22:23,232
Exploited forever and turn them around on

401
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:26,816
Because he knows that the only argument you could really use against them

402
00:22:27,072 --> 00:22:29,632
Is an argument that also erodes his religion

403
00:22:29,888 --> 00:22:30,400
Hegemony

404
00:22:31,168 --> 00:22:33,728
It's they have got him trapped

405
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:36,288
Is he

406
00:22:36,544 --> 00:22:37,056
Use against

407
00:22:37,568 --> 00:22:39,872
Whatever they're doing on a religious ground

408
00:22:40,128 --> 00:22:40,640
Kia Rhodes

409
00:22:41,408 --> 00:22:41,920
Is power

410
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,480
Advocating for an outing

411
00:22:46,016 --> 00:22:46,528
That is

412
00:22:46,784 --> 00:22:48,576
Going to crush all other religion

413
00:22:48,832 --> 00:22:50,880
If it's it's not forcing his hand

414
00:22:52,928 --> 00:22:55,488
Is that their evil work

415
00:22:56,256 --> 00:22:57,792
Pretty lame and absolutely again

416
00:22:58,304 --> 00:22:59,328
Their own

417
00:22:59,584 --> 00:23:00,352
Stated

418
00:23:00,608 --> 00:23:01,120
Position

419
00:23:01,376 --> 00:23:04,192
Anytime

420
00:23:04,448 --> 00:23:06,240
Recognize the people do believe in

421
00:23:06,496 --> 00:23:07,008
A literal

422
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:14,944
Really are we sure about that I'm not sure that I'm at positive

423
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,480
There are some folk who

424
00:23:16,736 --> 00:23:18,272
I've never met

425
00:23:26,976 --> 00:23:28,256
This is pretty fun

426
00:23:29,536 --> 00:23:30,560
In hating this

427
00:23:30,816 --> 00:23:32,864
Which is a group of the documentaries about

428
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,168
Does an unlikely Ally

429
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:40,032
And that is

430
00:23:40,288 --> 00:23:45,664
A representative of the Church of Satan who said that quote

431
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:52,064
Troll Quest for attention. Real statement

432
00:23:53,088 --> 00:23:59,232
Enemy of my enemy is my friend Alex

433
00:24:05,888 --> 00:24:06,656
They can agree on some

434
00:24:09,984 --> 00:24:13,056
About them

435
00:24:13,568 --> 00:24:14,080
Gilmore

436
00:24:14,336 --> 00:24:16,128
The current high priest of the Church of Satan

437
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:20,480
Alex feels that the Baphomet statue

438
00:24:20,736 --> 00:24:23,552
Get rid of religious encroachment on State Property

439
00:24:23,808 --> 00:24:24,576
Is a monument

440
00:24:24,832 --> 00:24:25,344
Pedophilia

441
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,904
Since they were children on each side of

442
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:28,672
Goatman

443
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,488
Gilmore quotes

444
00:24:31,744 --> 00:24:32,768
Pedophilic

445
00:24:33,792 --> 00:24:35,840
Fellows

446
00:24:36,096 --> 00:24:37,120
Alex Jones

447
00:24:37,376 --> 00:24:37,888
Church of Satan

448
00:24:39,168 --> 00:24:39,680
You know it's

449
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:41,216
It's nice to see that

450
00:24:41,472 --> 00:24:43,520
They can put aside all of their married

451
00:24:45,056 --> 00:24:45,568
Agree to

452
00:24:45,824 --> 00:24:46,592
You call a lot of

453
00:24:51,712 --> 00:24:54,272
You would think that the people who were

454
00:24:54,528 --> 00:24:55,040
The Church of Satan

455
00:24:55,296 --> 00:24:56,576
Would be bored Center

456
00:24:57,088 --> 00:24:59,136
About things that leads

457
00:24:59,392 --> 00:24:59,904
You really do

458
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:00,672
Yeah

459
00:25:01,184 --> 00:25:01,696
I don't know

460
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:04,768
We should be prosecuted

461
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:11,168
I'm sure nobody else will Mystic the two of us

462
00:25:11,424 --> 00:25:15,520
The poor ones who were trapped

463
00:25:19,616 --> 00:25:20,384
Seems to show.

464
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,152
True colors

465
00:25:21,408 --> 00:25:22,944
So I am

466
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:23,712
Disease

467
00:25:23,968 --> 00:25:24,992
Very strong scent

468
00:25:26,784 --> 00:25:29,088
Triggered by watching this documentary

469
00:25:29,344 --> 00:25:31,648
Lunch because they are literal

470
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:34,464
Because they are worshipping a literal Satan

471
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:38,304
He's more triggered by the idea that they make

472
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:39,328
Vulnerable

473
00:25:39,584 --> 00:25:40,864
Any populations that Alex

474
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:41,632
These eyes

475
00:25:42,656 --> 00:25:43,936
Non desirable

476
00:25:44,192 --> 00:25:48,032
Can you imagine Alex Musk

477
00:25:48,288 --> 00:25:48,800
Gone through

478
00:25:49,312 --> 00:25:52,384
Listening to his arguments shot back at him whenever he

479
00:25:52,896 --> 00:25:55,200
Whenever the cognitive dissonance in his brain

480
00:25:55,456 --> 00:25:56,224
Exploded

481
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:57,248
That's where we are

482
00:25:58,272 --> 00:25:59,040
Cuz he's like s***

483
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:02,112
They're saying the same stuff I'm saying

484
00:26:04,928 --> 00:26:07,488
My only move forward is

485
00:26:07,744 --> 00:26:08,256
2

486
00:26:08,512 --> 00:26:09,536
Heavily demonize

487
00:26:10,304 --> 00:26:13,888
Nnn basically manifested satanic

488
00:26:14,144 --> 00:26:17,472
Exactly

489
00:26:17,728 --> 00:26:18,496
And that's what he died

490
00:26:19,776 --> 00:26:22,336
It's all about killing babies after they're born

491
00:26:25,664 --> 00:26:26,688
And they talk about

492
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:33,856
Pedestal

493
00:26:34,368 --> 00:26:38,464
And I was in the theater with all the Austin liberals

494
00:26:38,976 --> 00:26:41,280
Squirming

495
00:26:41,536 --> 00:26:46,400
Norfolk

496
00:26:48,448 --> 00:26:52,032
The weakest of the weak the ugliest please are Satan's minions

497
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,080
These are Satan's servants

498
00:26:54,848 --> 00:26:55,360
Death

499
00:26:59,968 --> 00:27:02,272
We have to bring God back into America

500
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:04,576
Have to do it now

501
00:27:05,088 --> 00:27:08,160
So I mean you see right there you have the

502
00:27:08,416 --> 00:27:13,024
Desire to push a satanic panic

503
00:27:14,304 --> 00:27:15,584
This desire to bring

504
00:27:16,864 --> 00:27:17,632
To control

505
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:18,912
It's a good idea.

506
00:27:20,704 --> 00:27:21,472
Right now is the

507
00:27:21,728 --> 00:27:27,872
Perfect time for the theocracy

508
00:27:28,128 --> 00:27:31,200
Sharia law

509
00:27:31,456 --> 00:27:32,736
Centre-right completely different

510
00:27:33,248 --> 00:27:37,600
We need to react

511
00:27:42,464 --> 00:27:45,536
I don't know what that is

512
00:27:49,888 --> 00:27:56,032
I just I just mentally transported to like a Mad TV writers room

513
00:27:57,312 --> 00:28:01,152
Got a crack this

514
00:28:01,408 --> 00:28:04,224
This out

515
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:04,992
We won't

516
00:28:05,248 --> 00:28:06,016
Someone else

517
00:28:07,552 --> 00:28:09,088
Sat there and Alex

518
00:28:09,344 --> 00:28:10,368
Continues doing this

519
00:28:10,624 --> 00:28:12,160
Throughout

520
00:28:12,416 --> 00:28:14,720
Getting more extreme

521
00:28:14,976 --> 00:28:15,744
Really just

522
00:28:16,256 --> 00:28:17,536
Irritability

523
00:28:17,792 --> 00:28:18,560
To deal with

524
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:21,120
This Titanic Temple as an actual

525
00:28:21,632 --> 00:28:22,912
Intelligent

526
00:28:23,424 --> 00:28:25,216
Group that is intentionally doing this

527
00:28:25,472 --> 00:28:26,496
These things for political reasons

528
00:28:26,752 --> 00:28:29,312
Exactly until he just turned it into even more

529
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,128
Nor fear

530
00:28:33,152 --> 00:28:34,688
Coming for your children

531
00:28:35,456 --> 00:28:37,504
Children location

532
00:28:44,672 --> 00:28:45,440
Anime

533
00:28:45,696 --> 00:28:46,976
Is highly funded or not

534
00:28:47,744 --> 00:28:50,048
I try to make it easy to support Ash

535
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:54,912
My activity

536
00:28:55,168 --> 00:28:55,680
The Great

537
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,240
Yes

538
00:29:00,288 --> 00:29:02,848
Extreme already have your kids

539
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:10,784
The Alamo Drafthouse

540
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:17,952
So buy some f****** secret 12 so I can

541
00:29:18,208 --> 00:29:18,720
Make it up

542
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:20,512
It's

543
00:29:20,768 --> 00:29:26,144
So annoyed hate that now they are killing babies after they're born

544
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,168
Bulshit

545
00:29:31,776 --> 00:29:32,800
People have already used

546
00:29:33,056 --> 00:29:34,080
Is all of their other s***

547
00:29:35,616 --> 00:29:39,968
Because we're in the situation that we are where you can just say any untruth in everybody's go

548
00:29:40,224 --> 00:29:42,016
Going to buy it or the people you like her

549
00:29:43,296 --> 00:29:45,088
You can just say either killing babies

550
00:29:50,976 --> 00:29:53,024
I wonder I wonder

551
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:53,792
Like a

552
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:55,072
We've had

553
00:29:55,328 --> 00:29:56,864
Progression of argument abs

554
00:29:58,656 --> 00:29:59,168
Jay

555
00:29:59,424 --> 00:30:01,984
I wonder how much it is and how much it is

556
00:30:08,128 --> 00:30:09,152
I wonder how much of it is

557
00:30:09,408 --> 00:30:09,920
Is just like

558
00:30:10,176 --> 00:30:14,016
Escalation always 52

559
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:16,832
Staff

560
00:30:17,344 --> 00:30:18,368
You know what else is killing baby

561
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:21,184
Birth control

562
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,024
Is there mom had birth

563
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:25,792
Control when they were

564
00:30:29,632 --> 00:30:30,144
Things were

565
00:30:31,424 --> 00:30:32,192
Stupid ideas

566
00:30:32,448 --> 00:30:35,520
20 years ago when I was listening to Loveline

567
00:30:35,776 --> 00:30:36,544
And they're still

568
00:30:37,312 --> 00:30:39,360
Do condoms cost

569
00:30:41,152 --> 00:30:42,432
These statements have your kids

570
00:30:42,688 --> 00:30:47,808
Give Alex money

571
00:30:48,064 --> 00:30:54,208
In most situations

572
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,080
The movie Ranch

573
00:31:11,104 --> 00:31:12,384
You like some sort of good guy

574
00:31:12,896 --> 00:31:15,200
Work for money

575
00:31:23,136 --> 00:31:23,648
So

576
00:31:29,024 --> 00:31:30,560
Uglier

577
00:31:30,816 --> 00:31:31,840
Uglier

578
00:31:32,096 --> 00:31:34,144
Uglier uglier because they're ugly

579
00:31:34,656 --> 00:31:35,424
A spiritual level

580
00:31:35,936 --> 00:31:39,520
Michelle's onto you

581
00:31:40,800 --> 00:31:43,872
Outrageous

582
00:31:44,128 --> 00:31:46,688
Get caught them

583
00:31:46,944 --> 00:31:48,736
I want you to stop

584
00:31:49,504 --> 00:31:50,016
Alex

585
00:31:50,272 --> 00:31:50,784
And we are

586
00:31:51,552 --> 00:31:52,064
Listen to

587
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:54,880
Because God

588
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:59,488
He does eat does ramble a little bit after this

589
00:31:59,744 --> 00:32:00,512
It's about

590
00:32:00,768 --> 00:32:01,280
Some sort of like

591
00:32:01,536 --> 00:32:02,304
God lyrics

592
00:32:02,816 --> 00:32:04,608
It doesn't make it better cuz

593
00:32:05,376 --> 00:32:08,448
What are you stopping into there is you can hurt him

594
00:32:08,704 --> 00:32:09,216
Yeah

595
00:32:09,472 --> 00:32:10,496
The water beer

596
00:32:11,008 --> 00:32:12,288
They're trying to get you

597
00:32:12,544 --> 00:32:15,104
To stop them

598
00:32:15,872 --> 00:32:18,432
Glide beating up

599
00:32:22,272 --> 00:32:26,624
Now wants to be he's in the stage of his career was like

600
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:29,184
Facebook

601
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:30,976
I'm losing so much money

602
00:32:31,232 --> 00:32:32,512
I need to be stopped

603
00:32:35,072 --> 00:32:36,096
Maybe

604
00:32:36,352 --> 00:32:40,192
Maybe that mean it's an interesting

605
00:32:40,448 --> 00:32:40,960
Satisfying

606
00:32:41,216 --> 00:32:42,240
People

607
00:32:42,496 --> 00:32:43,008
Be who you disagree

608
00:32:49,664 --> 00:32:53,760
Cuz you know it's a little

609
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:56,064
Sturtevant body adjust

610
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:57,088
Application of hurting you

611
00:32:57,344 --> 00:33:00,160
Your political enemies Express

612
00:33:00,672 --> 00:33:02,464
F*** it out of control

613
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:07,072
Atopic

614
00:33:08,864 --> 00:33:09,632
Next thing

615
00:33:11,936 --> 00:33:13,984
I'm a bunch of issues next hour

616
00:33:14,496 --> 00:33:15,776
Trump

617
00:33:16,032 --> 00:33:17,568
Tax returns

618
00:33:18,336 --> 00:33:22,432
Trump's Nobel moment

619
00:33:22,688 --> 00:33:23,456
Ever done

620
00:33:23,712 --> 00:33:26,528
So first thing East Bellport

621
00:33:26,784 --> 00:33:27,808
On talking about Trump

622
00:33:28,832 --> 00:33:31,136
And I don't really particularly care to

623
00:33:31,392 --> 00:33:32,672
To talk about it because I

624
00:33:32,928 --> 00:33:37,280
He knows what he's talking about

625
00:33:38,048 --> 00:33:41,888
Lot of money when your

626
00:33:42,144 --> 00:33:42,656
Investing in

627
00:33:44,192 --> 00:33:44,704
I don't

628
00:33:45,216 --> 00:33:45,984
I don't know enough

629
00:33:46,496 --> 00:33:47,776
Talk to coherently about it

630
00:33:54,688 --> 00:33:58,784
I'll drop off the billion.

631
00:34:01,856 --> 00:34:03,648
Executive privilege

632
00:34:03,904 --> 00:34:05,696
Alex is directly lion

633
00:34:06,464 --> 00:34:10,816
He sang the Trump waived executive privilege about the Mueller report and that is 100% not

634
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,632
There was an article in the Hill from that morning

635
00:34:14,656 --> 00:34:17,728
Claire's executive privilege over Mueller report

636
00:34:19,008 --> 00:34:22,080
The issue was the Congress wants Leon redacted reports they can invest

637
00:34:22,336 --> 00:34:22,848
Attendance

638
00:34:23,104 --> 00:34:25,664
Chances that mother laid out about possible obstruction

639
00:34:26,432 --> 00:34:27,712
Possible

640
00:34:27,968 --> 00:34:31,808
Interesting Lee attorney general and cover-up veteran William Barr his

641
00:34:32,064 --> 00:34:33,344
To provide them with the document

642
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:34,112
Just let the house

643
00:34:34,368 --> 00:34:35,136
Dictionary committee

644
00:34:35,392 --> 00:34:37,440
To schedule vote

645
00:34:37,696 --> 00:34:38,208
Congress

646
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:42,048
Trump's Administration executive privilege

647
00:34:44,096 --> 00:34:47,424
Basically

648
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:48,704
Even if you do that

649
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:49,472
You're not going to

650
00:34:49,728 --> 00:34:50,240
Get your report

651
00:34:51,008 --> 00:34:55,104
It also kind of feels like threatening to hurt a hostage to get your Co kidnapper out of

652
00:34:56,128 --> 00:34:57,664
Not a great metaphor

653
00:34:59,712 --> 00:35:02,272
This threat didn't work bar was held in contempt

654
00:35:02,528 --> 00:35:03,808
Bottagra switch for something

655
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:05,856
It sounds so serious

656
00:35:06,112 --> 00:35:07,904
Anythink

657
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:11,232
Destructive

658
00:35:11,744 --> 00:35:12,256
Investigation

659
00:35:12,512 --> 00:35:13,280
Whether or not

660
00:35:13,536 --> 00:35:14,048
Previously

661
00:35:14,304 --> 00:35:14,816
Obstructive jaundice

662
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:17,632
Nothing matters anymore in the government is a circus

663
00:35:17,888 --> 00:35:24,032
That's important is it Alex's literally

664
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:30,432
Really saying that Trump waive his right to executive privilege

665
00:35:30,688 --> 00:35:31,456
Opposite is true

666
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:36,832
This isn't over explicit example of him telling his two plus two equals five

667
00:35:37,088 --> 00:35:38,368
The very same thing

668
00:35:38,624 --> 00:35:40,416
Accuses his opponents in the video doing all the

669
00:35:40,672 --> 00:35:41,184
The time

670
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:43,744
Alex is directly lying to his audience

671
00:35:44,256 --> 00:35:46,048
Necessarily

672
00:35:49,888 --> 00:35:50,656
This is

673
00:35:50,912 --> 00:35:52,960
Something is demonstrable

674
00:35:53,216 --> 00:35:54,240
Actually

675
00:35:54,496 --> 00:35:58,848
You can find out what the truth is about that exact opposite

676
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,128
Right

677
00:36:00,384 --> 00:36:03,712
This one if he is

678
00:36:06,272 --> 00:36:09,856
Like maliciously lying or wrong

679
00:36:10,112 --> 00:36:10,624
Stupidly

680
00:36:11,136 --> 00:36:11,648
Because what he

681
00:36:12,928 --> 00:36:13,440
Is that

682
00:36:13,696 --> 00:36:15,744
The simple fact that we have the Mueller report

683
00:36:20,352 --> 00:36:20,864
Because he

684
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:27,264
Could have possibly

685
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:29,824
It's possible that it is the result of

686
00:36:30,336 --> 00:36:30,848
Profoundly

687
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:32,128
Poor thinking

688
00:36:32,384 --> 00:36:33,152
Yeah

689
00:36:33,408 --> 00:36:39,552
Except that on almost any other day on May 8th it was in the news the discussion

690
00:36:39,808 --> 00:36:43,136
Executive privilege Visa V the Mueller report

691
00:36:43,392 --> 00:36:46,208
It seems difficult for me to think it was like him

692
00:36:46,464 --> 00:36:46,976
Dumbly

693
00:36:47,488 --> 00:36:49,536
Miss asserting something or misunderstanding

694
00:36:49,792 --> 00:36:51,584
The actual report

695
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:52,352
Redact

696
00:36:53,632 --> 00:36:54,656
Kind of think it has to be

697
00:36:56,704 --> 00:36:59,520
I don't know why though

698
00:36:59,776 --> 00:37:00,800
Give me back to your stupidity

699
00:37:01,056 --> 00:37:02,592
Possibility

700
00:37:03,104 --> 00:37:06,688
Him a certain executive privilege over this isn't tougher Alex

701
00:37:07,968 --> 00:37:10,272
He could do that.

702
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:24,096
It's not a hard line to walk for no collusion

703
00:37:24,352 --> 00:37:25,888
Tough to figure out what the motive

704
00:37:26,144 --> 00:37:26,656
Lying

705
00:37:27,936 --> 00:37:28,704
Specifically about this

706
00:37:29,984 --> 00:37:31,264
I don't know whatever the case

707
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:33,056
Reality

708
00:37:33,312 --> 00:37:33,824
Reality

709
00:37:35,872 --> 00:37:36,640
So

710
00:37:36,896 --> 00:37:37,408
Par for the course

711
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:39,712
Big

712
00:37:40,224 --> 00:37:41,248
Story bigger than Satan

713
00:37:43,296 --> 00:37:43,808
Pretty f****** b****

714
00:37:44,064 --> 00:37:45,600
Satanism

715
00:37:45,856 --> 00:37:47,392
I'm shocked that we got through all that

716
00:37:47,648 --> 00:37:50,720
I'm stuff this quickly I thought that was going to take

717
00:37:51,232 --> 00:37:52,768
Maybe a week

718
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:57,120
Alex has another story here that I honestly think

719
00:37:57,632 --> 00:37:58,400
Is perfect

720
00:38:01,728 --> 00:38:03,264
It's dehumanizing

721
00:38:03,776 --> 00:38:05,312
Norteno what's going on internally

722
00:38:08,384 --> 00:38:09,664
I happen to have

723
00:38:10,688 --> 00:38:12,224
Until here

724
00:38:19,904 --> 00:38:22,208
As fast as they can

725
00:38:23,232 --> 00:38:25,536
To have

726
00:38:30,144 --> 00:38:31,424
Guess what I have

727
00:38:32,448 --> 00:38:33,472
Meme

728
00:38:36,032 --> 00:38:37,312
You guys remind me

729
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:43,712
115

730
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:46,784
When he said Dan Lyman was coming up I was like

731
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:47,552
Thank God

732
00:38:48,064 --> 00:38:48,576
Cakewalk

733
00:38:49,088 --> 00:38:55,232
Never been more wrong in my life

734
00:38:55,488 --> 00:38:58,048
Shadowing for later

735
00:38:58,304 --> 00:39:04,192
From your horse, imagine what was there

736
00:39:04,704 --> 00:39:05,984
I'm going to cover this

737
00:39:07,008 --> 00:39:08,032
At the start of the next hour

738
00:39:09,056 --> 00:39:10,848
That you're not going to

739
00:39:16,992 --> 00:39:19,552
To the people that have to censor the show imagine

740
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:26,720
Salsa music

741
00:39:33,376 --> 00:39:37,472
Sjw

742
00:39:38,496 --> 00:39:40,032
Upwards of half of them

743
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:43,104
Are becoming program and brainwashed

744
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:44,640
And I'm totally freaking out

745
00:39:45,664 --> 00:39:46,688
And then quote

746
00:39:52,832 --> 00:39:56,416
Be

747
00:40:00,512 --> 00:40:02,816
Good teachable moment

748
00:40:03,072 --> 00:40:03,584
I believe

749
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:07,424
And ourselves

750
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:08,704
Explicitly what's going on

751
00:40:09,216 --> 00:40:11,264
Alex's pretending videos internal intelligence

752
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:12,800
What's going on in Facebook

753
00:40:13,056 --> 00:40:14,848
But all he really has something

754
00:40:15,104 --> 00:40:16,128
Already found on PBS

755
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:17,920
That's all he ever has

756
00:40:18,176 --> 00:40:19,712
He has no inside information

757
00:40:19,968 --> 00:40:21,248
Get no high-level sources

758
00:40:21,504 --> 00:40:23,808
He has publicly published articles that he covers and

759
00:40:24,064 --> 00:40:26,624
Pretends matches intelligence that he's already received

760
00:40:27,136 --> 00:40:27,648
Literally

761
00:40:27,904 --> 00:40:30,976
Public information

762
00:40:31,232 --> 00:40:37,120
On the show and we don't often stopped

763
00:40:37,376 --> 00:40:38,656
Of what he's doing

764
00:40:39,168 --> 00:40:44,800
So one of the other things that's important to point out we already

765
00:40:45,312 --> 00:40:46,080
Is BBs

766
00:40:46,592 --> 00:40:48,384
The matches intelligence that we already have

767
00:40:48,896 --> 00:40:49,920
And that is a referee

768
00:40:50,176 --> 00:40:50,944
Prince to the fact

769
00:40:51,712 --> 00:40:53,504
The PBS article is just

770
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,296
The transcript of an interview

771
00:40:55,552 --> 00:40:56,320
With this guy named Casey

772
00:40:56,576 --> 00:40:57,088
Newton

773
00:40:57,344 --> 00:40:59,904
And it's just a conversation about an article Casey

774
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:02,208
About content moderator February

775
00:41:02,464 --> 00:41:04,768
The information that Alex said it matched up with

776
00:41:05,024 --> 00:41:07,328
Is the article that Casey wrote In The Verge

777
00:41:07,584 --> 00:41:09,120
In February which is the

778
00:41:09,376 --> 00:41:15,520
Previous Intel that Alex had the pit BBS article matches up with because it's an interview with the writer of that article

779
00:41:16,288 --> 00:41:17,056
Nefarious

780
00:41:17,312 --> 00:41:17,824
I'm so much

781
00:41:19,616 --> 00:41:20,384
Explain

782
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:21,664
The process of how

783
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:23,200
He pretends their sources

784
00:41:23,712 --> 00:41:24,736
Things match up with Intel

785
00:41:24,992 --> 00:41:26,528
That is exactly what's going on here

786
00:41:27,808 --> 00:41:31,648
The PBS article

787
00:41:31,904 --> 00:41:33,440
Right about the conversation

788
00:41:33,696 --> 00:41:34,208
About the art

789
00:41:35,232 --> 00:41:36,768
York

790
00:41:37,024 --> 00:41:40,608
The trauma that social media job

791
00:41:40,864 --> 00:41:44,192
Horrifying picture of the working conditions at cognizant

792
00:41:44,704 --> 00:41:47,520
A company subcontracted by Facebook to battery contact

793
00:41:48,032 --> 00:41:49,312
It's not the same company

794
00:41:49,568 --> 00:41:50,848
OKC in the interview does make

795
00:41:51,104 --> 00:41:51,872
Make a good point I think it's

796
00:41:52,384 --> 00:41:54,943
Pretty fair

797
00:41:55,199 --> 00:41:56,735
Facebook employees

798
00:41:56,991 --> 00:42:00,319
In everything but name

799
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:02,879
Probably legal distinction

800
00:42:03,135 --> 00:42:09,279
Will the government like FEI does security contract right

801
00:42:09,535 --> 00:42:10,047
Work in the same

802
00:42:15,423 --> 00:42:16,191
Acura

803
00:42:20,031 --> 00:42:23,615
The orders that Facebook gives them

804
00:42:23,871 --> 00:42:27,199
Workers

805
00:42:27,455 --> 00:42:30,783
Racist content

806
00:42:31,039 --> 00:42:32,319
And all manner of other.

807
00:42:32,575 --> 00:42:34,879
Deeply disturbing things that people post on Facebook

808
00:42:35,903 --> 00:42:36,927
The author of this piece

809
00:42:37,183 --> 00:42:39,487
Experience

810
00:42:39,743 --> 00:42:40,255
From the work

811
00:42:43,071 --> 00:42:44,607
Gun

812
00:42:44,863 --> 00:42:47,423
Even while sleeping due to threats for people whose content would be

813
00:42:48,703 --> 00:42:52,543
Or at least fears of reprisal people whose content

814
00:42:53,055 --> 00:42:53,823
Sensor

815
00:42:58,431 --> 00:42:58,943
It sounds

816
00:42:59,199 --> 00:43:01,503
Leica an abusive fact

817
00:43:02,015 --> 00:43:02,527
That doesn't

818
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:04,575
Korean animation

819
00:43:05,087 --> 00:43:07,647
Intent micro management of employees time

820
00:43:07,903 --> 00:43:09,695
What they can and can't do with their break

821
00:43:09,951 --> 00:43:10,975
Ineffectual Council

822
00:43:11,231 --> 00:43:11,743
Towing services

823
00:43:11,999 --> 00:43:14,559
Being provided in harsh productivity and accuracy

824
00:43:14,815 --> 00:43:16,095
Spectations all add up to

825
00:43:16,351 --> 00:43:17,887
Hostile environment

826
00:43:18,655 --> 00:43:21,727
Even if these people weren't being made to experience Horrors

827
00:43:21,983 --> 00:43:23,007
As a part of their job

828
00:43:23,519 --> 00:43:27,871
Employees describe the experience of talking to a co-worker is trauma bonding

829
00:43:31,199 --> 00:43:32,991
Do quotes go hang out on the roof

830
00:43:33,247 --> 00:43:35,039
Code for wanting to jump off it

831
00:43:35,807 --> 00:43:40,159
One employee describes how you always loved cooking but now is afraid to be around knives

832
00:43:40,415 --> 00:43:44,767
Because every time he's reminded of a video where a man is stabbed

833
00:43:45,023 --> 00:43:46,559
The death and cries out for his mother is

834
00:43:46,815 --> 00:43:48,607
He dies

835
00:43:48,863 --> 00:43:50,399
And now he also believes autonomy

836
00:43:50,655 --> 00:43:52,703
Terrorist attacks were false Flags

837
00:43:52,959 --> 00:43:55,775
And wakes up every morning with a gun in hand and performs in arms

838
00:43:56,287 --> 00:43:56,799
Take this home

839
00:43:57,055 --> 00:43:59,615
He was recently diagnosed with PTSD and began

840
00:44:00,383 --> 00:44:01,919
I'm f***** up man

841
00:44:02,175 --> 00:44:06,271
I don't think it's possible to do the job and not come out of it with some acute stress disorder

842
00:44:06,527 --> 00:44:07,039
PTSD

843
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:09,599
This is the closest

844
00:44:09,855 --> 00:44:10,367
Anything

845
00:44:10,623 --> 00:44:11,391
This article comes

846
00:44:11,647 --> 00:44:12,415
What else is basa

847
00:44:12,671 --> 00:44:14,207
Thing is almost gleeful reporting

848
00:44:14,463 --> 00:44:16,255
The quote basically has with the moderators

849
00:44:16,767 --> 00:44:17,279
Brainwashed

850
00:44:17,535 --> 00:44:18,047
Freaking out

851
00:44:18,303 --> 00:44:18,815
And they're sending them

852
00:44:19,071 --> 00:44:19,583
The Mentalist

853
00:44:20,607 --> 00:44:21,119
They didn't

854
00:44:21,375 --> 00:44:22,655
Send this guy to Ventolin

855
00:44:22,911 --> 00:44:23,935
Tiffany Scott help

856
00:44:24,447 --> 00:44:25,215
Because

857
00:44:27,263 --> 00:44:29,311
Death awfulness

858
00:44:29,567 --> 00:44:30,335
Experience

859
00:44:30,591 --> 00:44:31,103
They broadcast

860
00:44:40,831 --> 00:44:46,975
Because people do exactly every single day

861
00:44:47,231 --> 00:44:47,743
More nuanced

862
00:44:48,767 --> 00:44:50,047
I got

863
00:44:50,303 --> 00:44:51,071
Interviews

864
00:44:51,327 --> 00:44:52,863
About this

865
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:55,935
Does they generally do make a point that

866
00:44:57,215 --> 00:45:02,079
The bulk of what they deal with is maybe a slur or bullying

867
00:45:02,335 --> 00:45:04,383
The most of it is that sort of thing

868
00:45:04,639 --> 00:45:05,663
But I would respond

869
00:45:10,015 --> 00:45:13,343
Yeah I could never

870
00:45:13,599 --> 00:45:14,367
Even come close

871
00:45:14,623 --> 00:45:15,903
Watching Christ

872
00:45:16,415 --> 00:45:19,743
I could never even come close to people want

873
00:45:20,511 --> 00:45:21,023
Affect you

874
00:45:21,279 --> 00:45:22,303
Yeah

875
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:23,839
It doesn't matter

876
00:45:24,863 --> 00:45:29,215
It doesn't matter how much of a snowflake Alex might call you for that response

877
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:30,495
It's a response

878
00:45:30,751 --> 00:45:31,519
To your Humanity

879
00:45:32,543 --> 00:45:37,151
The article is about the human that comes from running content moderation in

880
00:45:37,407 --> 00:45:38,431
The same way companies run cost

881
00:45:38,943 --> 00:45:39,455
Sporcle

882
00:45:40,223 --> 00:45:42,527
It's a brutal job where people expected

883
00:45:42,783 --> 00:45:43,551
The awful thing

884
00:45:43,807 --> 00:45:45,855
Exposed

885
00:45:46,111 --> 00:45:48,671
That make an impact on them

886
00:45:49,439 --> 00:45:52,255
And the greatest indictment of this article is not on the people

887
00:45:52,511 --> 00:45:53,279
Posting f*****-up

888
00:45:53,535 --> 00:45:54,815
It's a Facebook

889
00:45:55,327 --> 00:45:56,351
And it's subconscious

890
00:45:56,607 --> 00:45:58,399
Better job of take

891
00:45:58,911 --> 00:45:59,679
Care of their employees

892
00:46:00,447 --> 00:46:01,983
But you talk about heavy ideas

893
00:46:02,495 --> 00:46:03,263
You can have these

894
00:46:03,519 --> 00:46:05,311
Horrible reaction

895
00:46:05,823 --> 00:46:07,359
To the work that you're made to do

896
00:46:07,615 --> 00:46:08,895
But because the work is

897
00:46:09,151 --> 00:46:10,175
Really awful and

898
00:46:10,431 --> 00:46:14,015
The place is run poorly most people end up working there for like 8 months

899
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:15,551
Yeah and then you leave

900
00:46:17,087 --> 00:46:17,599
Is liquor

901
00:46:17,855 --> 00:46:19,903
And a place where you worked for 8 months

902
00:46:20,159 --> 00:46:21,951
Isn't going to pay for you to go get help

903
00:46:22,207 --> 00:46:24,255
So these are the issues

904
00:46:24,511 --> 00:46:25,791
Coming up in this article that

905
00:46:27,839 --> 00:46:28,351
Pretty much

906
00:46:28,607 --> 00:46:31,167
Middle finger at these companies in the

907
00:46:32,703 --> 00:46:34,495
Very Alex only exist

908
00:46:34,751 --> 00:46:36,543
First of all not at all

909
00:46:36,799 --> 00:46:38,591
Specifically it's mostly about like

910
00:46:38,847 --> 00:46:42,175
Murder videos

911
00:46:42,687 --> 00:46:44,991
He only exists as a phantom as a

912
00:46:46,015 --> 00:46:48,063
Byproduct of doing business

913
00:46:48,575 --> 00:46:51,391
Like they don't even give a s*** about the idea that

914
00:46:51,647 --> 00:46:52,671
Of him as

915
00:46:53,183 --> 00:46:53,951
Monster Run

916
00:46:54,207 --> 00:46:54,719
Anything like that

917
00:46:55,231 --> 00:46:56,767
It's the it's about the

918
00:46:57,279 --> 00:46:58,559
Yeah I know they're there

919
00:46:59,327 --> 00:47:00,351
Basically predators

920
00:47:03,935 --> 00:47:04,703
And then they

921
00:47:04,959 --> 00:47:06,239
F****** throw them away

922
00:47:06,495 --> 00:47:07,007
Life

923
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:11,615
I get tortured all day

924
00:47:11,871 --> 00:47:12,383
And then I go home

925
00:47:12,639 --> 00:47:13,663
Maybe.

926
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:19,039
Articles about news

927
00:47:19,295 --> 00:47:20,063
Important conversation

928
00:47:22,111 --> 00:47:23,135
Engage that conversation

929
00:47:23,391 --> 00:47:25,439
You be able to score points against Facebook

930
00:47:25,695 --> 00:47:29,023
Actually looking at what was being discussed.

931
00:47:30,815 --> 00:47:32,095
They're exhibiting weakness

932
00:47:32,863 --> 00:47:34,911
Rather attack the people who

933
00:47:35,935 --> 00:47:39,007
Maybe but I don't think he's even doing that

934
00:47:39,775 --> 00:47:40,543
I think he's a monster

935
00:47:44,127 --> 00:47:46,431
Not an opportunity for him to make everything about his

936
00:47:47,199 --> 00:47:47,711
Light

937
00:47:47,967 --> 00:47:48,479
It's korachi

938
00:47:48,735 --> 00:47:49,759
Cheap self-serving

939
00:47:53,855 --> 00:47:55,391
Trying to make this argument

940
00:47:55,903 --> 00:47:56,671
Victor

941
00:47:57,439 --> 00:47:59,231
I think he's going to get into it more

942
00:47:59,487 --> 00:47:59,999
Later

943
00:48:01,279 --> 00:48:05,119
He's using the story is kind of rational but he's right

944
00:48:05,887 --> 00:48:06,399
About

945
00:48:07,935 --> 00:48:08,959
The wrong way to look at

946
00:48:09,983 --> 00:48:10,751
I would say

947
00:48:11,263 --> 00:48:14,335
The interview Casey Newton did on TBS literally had nothing

948
00:48:14,591 --> 00:48:15,103
Alex Jones

949
00:48:15,359 --> 00:48:17,151
The conversation was

950
00:48:17,663 --> 00:48:18,431
Discussion of this

951
00:48:18,687 --> 00:48:19,199
Investigator

952
00:48:19,711 --> 00:48:20,991
Honda moderation fact

953
00:48:21,759 --> 00:48:22,271
The very

954
00:48:22,527 --> 00:48:25,855
Interview

955
00:48:26,111 --> 00:48:26,879
When introducing the

956
00:48:27,135 --> 00:48:29,695
Mention that a bunch of people recently kicked off Facebook app

957
00:48:29,951 --> 00:48:32,511
Instagram and that's why there's a renewed conversation about case

958
00:48:32,767 --> 00:48:33,791
February

959
00:48:34,047 --> 00:48:34,559
Basically just

960
00:48:34,815 --> 00:48:36,351
Explain why it makes sense for them to have the

961
00:48:36,607 --> 00:48:37,119
This conversation

962
00:48:37,631 --> 00:48:39,423
Yeah that's

963
00:48:41,983 --> 00:48:42,751
The platform

964
00:48:45,567 --> 00:48:47,103
So if its next flip

965
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:48,639
I just want to play

966
00:48:50,175 --> 00:48:50,687
To understand

967
00:48:50,943 --> 00:48:52,479
This is what like we now

968
00:48:52,735 --> 00:48:53,759
Understand

969
00:48:54,015 --> 00:48:55,039
The article in the source

970
00:48:55,295 --> 00:48:56,575
Material that you talkin about

971
00:48:56,831 --> 00:48:57,855
And here is how he talks

972
00:49:00,671 --> 00:49:03,743
Facebook

973
00:49:03,999 --> 00:49:10,143
That when they tell him and then they go watch years of my show these people absolutely

974
00:49:14,495 --> 00:49:16,799
Is the angle and the narrative that he's using

975
00:49:17,311 --> 00:49:18,591
These people who are suffering

976
00:49:19,103 --> 00:49:20,127
Horrible consequences

977
00:49:21,151 --> 00:49:22,943
Being exposed videos

978
00:49:23,455 --> 00:49:25,503
Inshot

979
00:49:25,759 --> 00:49:26,271
Into that

980
00:49:26,527 --> 00:49:27,807
Some racist

981
00:49:28,063 --> 00:49:28,831
For content in

982
00:49:29,087 --> 00:49:30,111
Written form

983
00:49:31,135 --> 00:49:33,951
Amb a lot of people there

984
00:49:34,207 --> 00:49:34,719
Towards

985
00:49:34,975 --> 00:49:36,511
I'll bring your not examining things

986
00:49:37,791 --> 00:49:38,815
If you're secure

987
00:49:39,583 --> 00:49:41,375
There is a

988
00:49:41,887 --> 00:49:42,399
Towards

989
00:49:42,655 --> 00:49:44,191
Automatic

990
00:49:45,471 --> 00:49:45,983
When

991
00:49:46,495 --> 00:49:47,519
When you're exposed

992
00:49:48,031 --> 00:49:48,543
A conspiracy

993
00:49:48,799 --> 00:49:49,567
C content audit

994
00:49:50,847 --> 00:49:52,127
Which this is set up to

995
00:49:52,383 --> 00:49:56,479
Because their workload has an expectation

996
00:49:56,735 --> 00:49:57,503
You will just

997
00:49:57,759 --> 00:50:00,063
Be exposed to these ideas for a

998
00:50:00,575 --> 00:50:05,439
Cuz you got to get on to your next

999
00:50:05,695 --> 00:50:10,047
Piece of contact you after moderate overrides

1000
00:50:10,303 --> 00:50:11,839
Critical thinking skills irritability

1001
00:50:12,095 --> 00:50:14,655
Two bit like looking to acquainted

1002
00:50:14,911 --> 00:50:15,679
You'll just be

1003
00:50:15,935 --> 00:50:19,007
Muslims want to kill everybody

1004
00:50:19,263 --> 00:50:21,055
And if you're not careful

1005
00:50:21,311 --> 00:50:22,335
Your default

1006
00:50:22,847 --> 00:50:24,639
You could let your guard down

1007
00:50:24,895 --> 00:50:27,199
Eventually

1008
00:50:27,711 --> 00:50:28,223
True

1009
00:50:28,479 --> 00:50:29,503
So Alex is using

1010
00:50:29,759 --> 00:50:31,807
That reality as

1011
00:50:32,063 --> 00:50:37,439
They're supposed to my content and then they realize that I'm right about everything and then they're getting

1012
00:50:37,695 --> 00:50:39,487
Baker acted in sentimental

1013
00:50:39,743 --> 00:50:41,023
Because she

1014
00:50:41,279 --> 00:50:42,047
Going

1015
00:50:42,303 --> 00:50:46,143
The sjw globalist

1016
00:50:46,399 --> 00:50:48,703
Some sort of an evil force but everybody

1017
00:50:48,959 --> 00:50:49,471
Steve's

1018
00:50:49,727 --> 00:50:52,031
Do you know that they are wrong and I'm right

1019
00:50:52,287 --> 00:50:54,591
Everyday

1020
00:50:59,455 --> 00:51:01,247
Crazy necessarily

1021
00:51:01,503 --> 00:51:03,039
Social

1022
00:51:03,807 --> 00:51:08,927
The moments moments early on

1023
00:51:09,183 --> 00:51:11,487
But because I have the time to look into

1024
00:51:11,743 --> 00:51:12,255
Claims

1025
00:51:13,279 --> 00:51:13,791
To deal with what

1026
00:51:15,583 --> 00:51:16,863
Is actually

1027
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:18,911
It look into historical context

1028
00:51:19,679 --> 00:51:21,215
Listen to

1029
00:51:21,727 --> 00:51:23,775
More of the show that anybody probably

1030
00:51:24,031 --> 00:51:25,567
Come Away With It with

1031
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:26,591
No

1032
00:51:27,359 --> 00:51:27,871
He's right about any

1033
00:51:28,127 --> 00:51:29,919
Yeah so I'm living proof

1034
00:51:30,175 --> 00:51:30,687
But that argument

1035
00:51:31,199 --> 00:51:33,759
Yeah cuz

1036
00:51:34,015 --> 00:51:35,551
Droog living in

1037
00:51:35,807 --> 00:51:36,831
Clockwork Orange

1038
00:51:37,087 --> 00:51:38,879
I mean if I had to

1039
00:51:39,391 --> 00:51:39,903
Do

1040
00:51:40,159 --> 00:51:41,951
300 of these episodes

1041
00:51:43,743 --> 00:51:44,767
If I if I had

1042
00:51:45,791 --> 00:51:46,815
The sword of time could

1043
00:51:47,071 --> 00:51:48,095
Strength of

1044
00:51:48,607 --> 00:51:50,911
For someone who works in a place

1045
00:51:51,167 --> 00:51:51,679
Office

1046
00:51:52,191 --> 00:51:53,727
I couldn't do the show

1047
00:51:54,239 --> 00:51:55,263
The way that you are

1048
00:51:55,519 --> 00:51:57,567
I think I probably would have

1049
00:51:57,823 --> 00:52:03,199
Head must have any larger context and it was just

1050
00:52:03,967 --> 00:52:06,015
Short little clips of him saying some

1051
00:52:06,271 --> 00:52:07,551
Something very confidently that done

1052
00:52:08,063 --> 00:52:09,599
Just bombarding concert

1053
00:52:09,855 --> 00:52:11,135
Play over and over and over again

1054
00:52:11,391 --> 00:52:12,159
The short clips

1055
00:52:13,951 --> 00:52:14,719
And you're just

1056
00:52:14,975 --> 00:52:16,511
Eventually it's going to inspect your brain

1057
00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:19,071
Yeah

1058
00:52:19,327 --> 00:52:20,863
There's money behind it the propaganda

1059
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:21,631
Has

1060
00:52:22,655 --> 00:52:23,167
Craft

1061
00:52:24,959 --> 00:52:25,727
It's that

1062
00:52:25,983 --> 00:52:28,799
What we were starting to understand we didn't

1063
00:52:29,055 --> 00:52:30,335
People really knew

1064
00:52:30,591 --> 00:52:33,151
Would be a byproduct of

1065
00:52:33,663 --> 00:52:35,199
Attempts to moderate

1066
00:52:37,247 --> 00:52:38,783
Without those people

1067
00:52:39,039 --> 00:52:39,807
Who

1068
00:52:40,063 --> 00:52:40,831
This work

1069
00:52:41,087 --> 00:52:44,927
You have unusable

1070
00:52:45,951 --> 00:52:46,463
Destroyed

1071
00:52:46,719 --> 00:52:47,743
Fire

1072
00:52:49,279 --> 00:52:51,327
Everywhere

1073
00:52:52,863 --> 00:52:54,399
It's a post-apocalyptic

1074
00:52:55,423 --> 00:52:55,935
The fair assessment

1075
00:52:56,191 --> 00:53:00,031
Is it what's a actually this guy was arguing for is

1076
00:53:02,591 --> 00:53:03,359
Suggesting one

1077
00:53:03,615 --> 00:53:04,127
Protrude

1078
00:53:05,151 --> 00:53:07,455
Treat these people who work in the

1079
00:53:09,247 --> 00:53:10,271
The same way that you do

1080
00:53:10,783 --> 00:53:11,295
EMT

1081
00:53:13,855 --> 00:53:15,135
Give them

1082
00:53:15,391 --> 00:53:16,159
Give them higher

1083
00:53:16,671 --> 00:53:17,183
But because

1084
00:53:17,439 --> 00:53:18,719
Have an in-house

1085
00:53:18,975 --> 00:53:23,071
Counselor for

1086
00:53:23,327 --> 00:53:25,631
I'm not available lot of the time

1087
00:53:26,143 --> 00:53:28,703
Whatever Mental Health

1088
00:53:28,959 --> 00:53:30,239
Resource would be very important

1089
00:53:30,495 --> 00:53:32,799
Treat them like they're doing the service

1090
00:53:33,055 --> 00:53:34,079
For society

1091
00:53:34,335 --> 00:53:35,359
Because in many ways they are

1092
00:53:37,407 --> 00:53:39,199
I don't think there's much room to argue against

1093
00:53:40,223 --> 00:53:43,039
I know I absolutely agree with you

1094
00:53:43,295 --> 00:53:46,879
Gets a lot of mileage out of turning it into being about himself

1095
00:53:47,135 --> 00:53:49,439
As opposed to it being about beheading videos

1096
00:53:50,207 --> 00:53:51,487
Shooting

1097
00:53:51,743 --> 00:53:54,815
Well I mean I mean sink every time you go on Facebook

1098
00:53:55,839 --> 00:53:57,375
It's because of a moderator that I'm

1099
00:53:57,631 --> 00:53:59,935
Maybe not seeing a murder rate crying

1100
00:54:00,191 --> 00:54:01,471
Exactly the article

1101
00:54:01,727 --> 00:54:02,751
The argument

1102
00:54:03,007 --> 00:54:04,031
Excuse me is

1103
00:54:04,799 --> 00:54:06,079
Alex can make an argument

1104
00:54:06,335 --> 00:54:07,103
He makes it about him

1105
00:54:08,895 --> 00:54:11,199
They're doing all this to attack me

1106
00:54:12,479 --> 00:54:16,319
Nose on some level that the argument as it released

1107
00:54:17,343 --> 00:54:17,855
About

1108
00:54:18,367 --> 00:54:18,879
Horror

1109
00:54:19,647 --> 00:54:20,927
Jackie can't make that

1110
00:54:22,207 --> 00:54:24,511
That argument if he wants this to be

1111
00:54:24,767 --> 00:54:26,303
Be compelling and successful

1112
00:54:26,815 --> 00:54:28,351
So it makes it about himself

1113
00:54:30,399 --> 00:54:31,167
He might as well come out in

1114
00:54:31,423 --> 00:54:36,287
Like I used to watch faces of death before I went to sleep every night you know for sure

1115
00:54:36,799 --> 00:54:41,663
What kind of realize that was a dead end

1116
00:54:41,919 --> 00:54:42,687
But he didn't really want to

1117
00:54:42,943 --> 00:54:43,455
Get into it

1118
00:54:43,711 --> 00:54:46,783
He does get back into it a little bit later like shorts episode

1119
00:54:50,623 --> 00:54:53,951
Alex talks about have a Satanist

1120
00:54:54,207 --> 00:54:55,487
And that is that God wants

1121
00:54:55,999 --> 00:55:00,095
Welding montesini lowest of low Satanist

1122
00:55:00,863 --> 00:55:04,959
The work is Hollywood and the real shaking us to produce

1123
00:55:05,727 --> 00:55:06,239
Healthy

1124
00:55:08,287 --> 00:55:09,567
Garage

1125
00:55:10,335 --> 00:55:14,687
And their film Shan

1126
00:55:20,831 --> 00:55:21,855
That is God

1127
00:55:22,367 --> 00:55:23,391
The does The Killing

1128
00:55:24,927 --> 00:55:25,695
God

1129
00:55:25,951 --> 00:55:26,975
Vengeance

1130
00:55:28,511 --> 00:55:29,279
God

1131
00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:33,631
God

1132
00:55:35,935 --> 00:55:37,983
Is weird

1133
00:55:38,239 --> 00:55:39,263
There is a

1134
00:55:39,519 --> 00:55:40,543
He says a little bit later

1135
00:55:42,591 --> 00:55:44,127
Traffic may be trying to

1136
00:55:44,639 --> 00:55:50,783
Wiggle out

1137
00:56:01,023 --> 00:56:06,143
A mile or never know about real satanism

1138
00:56:08,959 --> 00:56:09,727
That was continued

1139
00:56:15,359 --> 00:56:18,431
Alright next flight

1140
00:56:18,687 --> 00:56:20,735
I think that's weird

1141
00:56:22,527 --> 00:56:27,391
The temple of

1142
00:56:29,183 --> 00:56:29,951
The actual sick

1143
00:56:30,463 --> 00:56:30,975
Right

1144
00:56:34,815 --> 00:56:37,375
Can you sing that they're not real luciferian

1145
00:56:38,655 --> 00:56:39,679
People in the documentary

1146
00:56:40,191 --> 00:56:40,703
AR

1147
00:56:40,959 --> 00:56:42,239
The

1148
00:56:42,495 --> 00:56:44,031
They're working for a literal Satan

1149
00:56:44,287 --> 00:56:45,567
And worship literal Satan

1150
00:56:45,823 --> 00:56:48,383
But they're also the sucked dry minions

1151
00:56:48,639 --> 00:56:50,175
Of true Satanist

1152
00:56:50,431 --> 00:56:54,271
Who are rich people takes a long time to get through his ideas

1153
00:56:54,527 --> 00:56:55,807
It does

1154
00:56:56,319 --> 00:57:00,927
Well I think he gets to talkin about

1155
00:57:01,183 --> 00:57:03,487
What's the version of real satanism

1156
00:57:07,839 --> 00:57:13,983
Sexual beautiful voluptuous woman

1157
00:57:14,239 --> 00:57:19,103
Businessman

1158
00:57:21,919 --> 00:57:24,735
This is meant to be

1159
00:57:28,831 --> 00:57:31,903
Because

1160
00:57:32,159 --> 00:57:38,303
To be soulless

1161
00:57:45,983 --> 00:57:46,495
This doesn't make

1162
00:57:47,007 --> 00:57:48,287
Why I really need

1163
00:57:48,543 --> 00:57:50,079
What did he say

1164
00:57:52,383 --> 00:57:53,407
Listen to becoming Satan

1165
00:57:55,199 --> 00:58:01,343

Exactly

1170
00:58:23,103 --> 00:58:23,871
It's nonsense

1171
00:58:26,943 --> 00:58:27,711
He expresses

1172
00:58:28,479 --> 00:58:31,039
More the idea that I was putting forth

1173
00:58:31,551 --> 00:58:33,087
What he is responding

1174
00:58:33,599 --> 00:58:34,111
You in these

1175
00:58:34,367 --> 00:58:34,879

?

1178
00:58:38,975 --> 00:58:44,095
Even the title there's a little bit of ambivalence

1179
00:58:46,399 --> 00:58:47,935
I believe it would he's responding

1180
00:58:48,191 --> 00:58:48,703
Two of them

1181
00:58:48,959 --> 00:58:49,471
Is

1182
00:58:49,983 --> 00:58:50,751
Resentment

1183
00:58:51,263 --> 00:58:51,775
Opposition

1184
00:58:52,031 --> 00:58:53,567
Did them because of their interest

1185
00:58:53,823 --> 00:58:54,335
Inequality

1186
00:58:54,847 --> 00:58:58,431
Look at the people in this film you can see

1187
00:58:58,687 --> 00:58:59,199
Gone

1188
00:58:59,711 --> 00:59:00,991
There's no one left there

1189
00:59:01,503 --> 00:59:03,295

And it's a celebration death of children

1194

Music inspirational music

1195
00:59:36,319 --> 00:59:38,367
Overlaid with what Alex

1196
00:59:38,623 --> 00:59:40,927

1197
00:59:41,183 --> 00:59:42,207
Hear that is like

1198

1199
00:59:43,743 --> 00:59:49,887
Alex drawing the devil

Do the Twenty Paces and turn

1201
00:59:53,983 --> 00:59:55,263
That's what I

1202
00:59:55,519 --> 00:59:57,567
Now I want to do a hail Satan

1203
00:59:57,823 --> 01:00:00,639
With a. And it's just about a cab driver named

1204

People around

1205
01:00:07,039 --> 01:00:08,319
I was trying to figure out a way to make that

1206
01:00:08,575 --> 01:00:09,343

Drum up a satanic

1211
01:00:22,655 --> 01:00:23,679
It's pretty gross

1212
01:00:24,191 --> 01:00:25,215
It's really

1213
01:00:29,823 --> 01:00:30,591
2019

1214
01:00:31,871 --> 01:00:34,687
Maybe the satanic panic

1215
01:00:34,943 --> 01:00:35,455
Everybody was

1216
01:00:36,223 --> 01:00:39,039

You can tell him stories like that really happened get the job

1253
01:02:48,575 --> 01:02:52,415
But you can't

1254
01:02:53,695 --> 01:02:54,975

1255
01:02:55,231 --> 01:02:56,511

So yeah I mean Mark Dice have to turn that around cuz it's a sign of weakness

1264
01:03:32,351 --> 01:03:32,863
He feels that the

1265
01:03:33,119 --> 01:03:34,399

Probably

1282
01:04:34,047 --> 01:04:34,815

Flying with a satanic panic

1287

Was real

1288
01:04:49,663 --> 01:04:50,175
Here you go

But we we should really be scared I was going to overturn

01:05:17,055 --> 01:05:17,823
Christianity

1294
01:05:18,335 --> 01:05:20,383
Such b*******

01:05:42,911 --> 01:05:43,423
Movies about devil

1301
01:05:43,935 --> 01:05:45,983
Gabriel Byrne

1302
01:05:47,775 --> 01:05:50,591
You might wonder about the

1303
01:05:53,919 --> 01:05:57,759
I literally found this to be one of the more troubling Clips I've ever heard

1304
01:05:58,015 --> 01:05:58,527
Alex

1305
01:05:59,039 --> 01:06:02,367
This is part one of

1306
01:06:02,623 --> 01:06:06,719
Play things that I find really disturbing the first one and then the next

1307
01:06:06,975 --> 01:06:09,023
Later in the episode

1308
01:06:11,071 --> 01:06:12,863
This is more just insane

1309
01:06:13,119 --> 01:06:13,631
This okay

1310
01:06:14,655 --> 01:06:16,447
Patrick Silicon Valley came from

1311
01:06:19,775 --> 01:06:23,359
Devil is a fallen angel

1312
01:06:23,871 --> 01:06:26,943
God did not say that

1313
01:06:32,575 --> 01:06:34,623
God has built

1314
01:06:34,879 --> 01:06:37,183
And she'll the devil doesn't really want to do it all

1315
01:06:37,439 --> 01:06:41,535
Tells this what been done before

1316
01:06:44,863 --> 01:06:46,399
What is the big

1317
01:06:46,655 --> 01:06:47,423
Deep stuff

1318
01:06:47,679 --> 01:06:50,495
Is that the devil trapped on Earth by God we got to

1319
01:06:51,263 --> 01:06:53,311
He knows a lot about

1320
01:06:54,335 --> 01:06:56,639
And there's been a lot of ancient civilizations that happen

1321
01:06:56,895 --> 01:06:59,199
Highly technological Jaguar

1322
01:06:59,455 --> 01:07:03,807
So he knows about those Technologies but he doesn't know how to build anything

1323
01:07:04,063 --> 01:07:04,575
So you can

1324
01:07:04,831 --> 01:07:10,463
Seduce people to Silicon Valley to create Silicon Valley with Promises of

1325
01:07:10,719 --> 01:07:11,999
Ancient technology

1326
01:07:12,255 --> 01:07:13,023
It is actually futurista

1327
01:07:13,279 --> 01:07:13,791
Speak to us

1328
01:07:14,047 --> 01:07:15,071
Rick

1329
01:07:15,583 --> 01:07:16,863
Okay this is not

1330
01:07:18,399 --> 01:07:19,935
This is nuts

1331
01:07:21,471 --> 01:07:25,055
I realize that the ultimate playing in the universe make perfect

1332
01:07:25,311 --> 01:07:26,847
When Alex says you're getting big

1333
01:07:28,383 --> 01:07:29,919
Really upsetting

1334
01:07:30,431 --> 01:07:32,479
Because that means that on some level

1335
01:07:32,991 --> 01:07:35,295
You presenting this is information that he believes

1336
01:07:35,551 --> 01:07:36,575
Has held back

1337
01:07:36,831 --> 01:07:38,367
Give you all of it

1338
01:07:41,439 --> 01:07:42,207
F***** up

1339
01:07:44,767 --> 01:07:45,791
Well

1340
01:07:46,047 --> 01:07:46,815
Look you don't want to do

1341
01:07:47,327 --> 01:07:48,863
Look if you come out on a first date

1342
01:07:49,119 --> 01:07:52,447
And say that you believe we're locked into a struggle of good and

1343
01:07:52,703 --> 01:07:55,263
Evil and that the devil is somewhere in trapped underneath

1344
01:07:55,519 --> 01:07:56,031
Earth

1345
01:07:56,287 --> 01:07:56,799
Is God dead

1346
01:07:57,311 --> 01:07:58,079
For whatever reason

1347
01:07:58,335 --> 01:08:00,639
Although that means

1348
01:08:00,895 --> 01:08:01,663
He's not a k a

1349
01:08:02,943 --> 01:08:05,759
Oso

1350
01:08:06,271 --> 01:08:07,551
Then

1351
01:08:11,903 --> 01:08:16,511
Is really get that

1352
01:08:25,215 --> 01:08:27,519
Give me a calculator

1353
01:08:28,287 --> 01:08:30,591
Now I must build

1354
01:08:31,103 --> 01:08:32,895
Alright

1355
01:08:33,151 --> 01:08:34,175
Alex

1356
01:08:36,735 --> 01:08:37,759
Democratic events

1357
01:08:38,015 --> 01:08:42,111
Or more accurately the people who are democratic

1358
01:08:42,367 --> 01:08:46,207
It depends on how you entirely.

1359
01:08:46,463 --> 01:08:48,511
I think I think

1360
01:08:49,791 --> 01:08:50,303
If you really listen

1361
01:08:50,559 --> 01:08:52,863
There's a better way to understand

1362
01:08:58,495 --> 01:08:59,775
The people look

1363
01:09:02,335 --> 01:09:04,895
They look like they're lost and that's the high-end

1364
01:09:05,919 --> 01:09:07,711
Apple's Immortal Oceanside

1365
01:09:16,671 --> 01:09:21,023
Weather for the enemy that they could simply

1366
01:09:22,559 --> 01:09:23,071
Finally

1367
01:09:23,327 --> 01:09:24,095
Have power

1368
01:09:25,119 --> 01:09:26,655
Empower

1369
01:09:29,983 --> 01:09:31,519
They found the Dead Space

1370
01:09:33,823 --> 01:09:35,359
And now they're only wish

1371
01:09:36,127 --> 01:09:37,151
Is it

1372
01:09:39,455 --> 01:09:40,223
Deposit

1373
01:09:40,735 --> 01:09:42,271
That I think that Zach

1374
01:09:42,527 --> 01:09:43,039
Clip

1375
01:09:43,551 --> 01:09:44,319
Perfectly

1376
01:09:44,575 --> 01:09:45,599
If you look

1377
01:09:45,855 --> 01:09:46,879
Through

1378
01:09:47,135 --> 01:09:48,159
As a defensive whites

1379
01:09:49,695 --> 01:09:50,207
Okay

1380
01:09:50,463 --> 01:09:53,535
Because what he's talkin about is people at liberal rally

1381
01:09:53,791 --> 01:09:54,815
They are gone

1382
01:09:55,071 --> 01:09:57,375
The devil has taken over them because they're on a quest

1383
01:09:57,631 --> 01:10:03,263
The power of black lives matter rally that I was

1384
01:10:03,519 --> 01:10:05,055
Or the woman's March

1385
01:10:05,311 --> 01:10:06,079
Diversions of

1386
01:10:06,335 --> 01:10:07,359
How are that they're trying

1387
01:10:07,615 --> 01:10:08,639
To take

1388
01:10:09,919 --> 01:10:11,199
More liberation

1389
01:10:11,455 --> 01:10:11,967
Scrum

1390
01:10:12,223 --> 01:10:13,247
Societal oppression

1391
01:10:13,503 --> 01:10:16,063
It's more about making things

1392
01:10:16,319 --> 01:10:17,855
Equitable

1393
01:10:18,111 --> 01:10:19,391
Empower overweight

1394
01:10:19,647 --> 01:10:20,415
Straight male

1395
01:10:20,671 --> 01:10:21,183
Right

1396
01:10:21,439 --> 01:10:23,231
The contextualisation of

1397
01:10:23,999 --> 01:10:25,535
For equality

1398
01:10:27,071 --> 01:10:27,583
Trying to take

1399
01:10:27,839 --> 01:10:29,375
Power over us

1400
01:10:29,631 --> 01:10:30,143
Yeah

1401
01:10:31,423 --> 01:10:33,983
If it's purely a defense of

1402
01:10:34,495 --> 01:10:36,287
Unit system wearing

1403
01:10:36,543 --> 01:10:39,103
Straight white male Christian

1404
01:10:39,359 --> 01:10:41,151
Are seen as the de-facto

1405
01:10:41,407 --> 01:10:43,711
Default

1406
01:10:43,967 --> 01:10:45,759
Swore and where the power lies

1407
01:10:46,783 --> 01:10:47,551
Just criticizing Danny

1408
01:10:48,063 --> 01:10:48,575
Turn

1409
01:10:55,743 --> 01:10:59,071
I've seen it but I don't know if the audience has

1410
01:10:59,583 --> 01:11:04,959
Sorry if you were waiting

1411
01:11:05,471 --> 01:11:11,103
Ryu would be but

1412
01:11:11,615 --> 01:11:16,991
Leanne Elizabeth Warren

1413
01:11:21,343 --> 01:11:25,695
I'm so I don't know I don't think

1414
01:11:33,631 --> 01:11:35,423
To staying but underneath what

1415
01:11:35,679 --> 01:11:36,191
You saying

1416
01:11:36,447 --> 01:11:36,959
The effect

1417
01:11:37,471 --> 01:11:38,239
Of what

1418
01:11:38,495 --> 01:11:39,519
Communicate to his audience

1419
01:11:39,775 --> 01:11:40,287
The people

1420
01:11:40,543 --> 01:11:41,311
He's trying to get them

1421
01:11:41,567 --> 01:11:42,079
Do not like

1422
01:11:42,335 --> 01:11:43,615
And the reason he's trying

1423
01:11:43,871 --> 01:11:44,895
To get them to not like them

1424
01:11:45,151 --> 01:11:45,919
8tracks

1425
01:11:46,431 --> 01:11:48,223
If you understand the code

1426
01:11:48,991 --> 01:11:49,503
Using SBA

1427
01:11:50,015 --> 01:11:50,527
The defense

1428
01:11:50,783 --> 01:11:52,831
Of of white

1429
01:11:53,087 --> 01:11:53,599
Default

1430
01:11:53,855 --> 01:11:55,135
Or whatever

1431
01:11:55,391 --> 01:11:57,183
Straight white male Christian

1432
01:11:57,695 --> 01:11:58,463
Absolute

1433
01:12:02,815 --> 01:12:04,351
I mean

1434
01:12:09,983 --> 01:12:12,031
There's room for semantic debate

1435
01:12:12,287 --> 01:12:12,799
I'm going to leave

1436
01:12:13,823 --> 01:12:15,871
So he gets done talking about Satan

1437
01:12:16,127 --> 01:12:17,663
For now

1438
01:12:17,919 --> 01:12:18,431
Comes back up

1439
01:12:20,223 --> 01:12:22,015
But he's mad about Facebook

1440
01:12:23,551 --> 01:12:25,855
Instagram

1441
01:12:26,111 --> 01:12:29,439
Initially that was what was really making him depressed at the beginning of the episode

1442
01:12:29,695 --> 01:12:31,999
And it might have been it might have been a part of it

1443
01:12:33,279 --> 01:12:35,839
He complains about how we need to break up

1444
01:12:37,631 --> 01:12:38,655
Social media

1445
01:12:40,447 --> 01:12:43,007
Teddy Roosevelt broke up the railroad

1446
01:12:43,263 --> 01:12:44,287
Cuz there was Monopoly

1447
01:12:46,079 --> 01:12:49,663
And I can't tell you how excited I am but how this clip goes

1448
01:12:54,783 --> 01:12:56,575
Roosevelt

1449
01:12:58,367 --> 01:12:58,879
He said

1450
01:13:00,159 --> 01:13:02,975
The railroads competition pay

1451
01:13:05,023 --> 01:13:07,071
The ship their own fruit

1452
01:13:07,583 --> 01:13:08,351
Underground

1453
01:13:13,471 --> 01:13:17,311
Pacifica

1454
01:13:20,127 --> 01:13:21,407
Promise to have your ass arrested

1455
01:13:32,927 --> 01:13:36,767
Commerce

1456
01:13:42,911 --> 01:13:43,935
A thousand miles

1457
01:13:47,007 --> 01:13:47,519
The kids

1458
01:13:50,847 --> 01:13:51,359
Oh boy

1459
01:13:52,639 --> 01:13:56,479
I can't tell you how much I f****** love that

1460
01:13:56,735 --> 01:13:59,295
What I say was a Gunsmoke

1461
01:13:59,551 --> 01:14:00,063
All the time

1462
01:14:00,319 --> 01:14:00,831
Haha

1463
01:14:12,607 --> 01:14:14,143
We're just trying to figure out how to make

1464
01:14:14,399 --> 01:14:18,239
TV shows in this era tell programs ever to air

1465
01:14:18,751 --> 01:14:19,519
Gunsmoke

1466
01:14:19,775 --> 01:14:20,543
20 seasons

1467
01:14:20,799 --> 01:14:23,871
It ended its run when Alex was one-year-old

1468
01:14:24,127 --> 01:14:27,711
A 14in was done before Alex was ever born

1469
01:14:31,039 --> 01:14:32,831
Somehow I

1470
01:14:33,343 --> 01:14:34,623
Unspoken Bonanza

1471
01:14:36,159 --> 01:14:39,743
It was ended long before I was coming

1472
01:14:39,999 --> 01:14:42,303
The s*** out of you

1473
01:14:42,559 --> 01:14:46,911
Gunsmoke was mostly show by Lawman being forced to make hard choices

1474
01:14:49,983 --> 01:14:51,007
Curiously High incidence

1475
01:14:51,519 --> 01:14:53,823
Applause of episode circle surrounding

1476
01:14:54,079 --> 01:14:56,639
Children Native American

1477
01:14:57,151 --> 01:15:00,991
Something that must have been a Hot Topic

1478
01:15:01,503 --> 01:15:07,135
As much as I'd love to talk about

1479
01:15:07,391 --> 01:15:10,975
Episode

1480
01:15:11,231 --> 01:15:17,375
YouTube

1481
01:15:17,631 --> 01:15:20,191
Topix up a little

1482
01:15:20,959 --> 01:15:23,263
1 years ago

1483
01:15:25,055 --> 01:15:28,127
I'm going to be the first openly admits he really liked it

1484
01:15:28,383 --> 01:15:29,151
Be very open

1485
01:15:29,407 --> 01:15:29,919
Clear

1486
01:15:30,431 --> 01:15:32,479
Even when my

1487
01:15:33,759 --> 01:15:35,039
This is one of those cases

1488
01:15:35,807 --> 01:15:37,855
Actually in the next

1489
01:15:38,111 --> 01:15:38,623
Squidward

1490
01:15:38,879 --> 01:15:42,719
Here Alex is going to make clear that he's talking about that episode 407

1491
01:15:42,975 --> 01:15:46,047
But before I started trying to solve the mystery

1492
01:15:46,303 --> 01:15:47,327
Of what episode

1493
01:15:48,095 --> 01:15:49,631
I came across an episode from season

1494
01:15:49,887 --> 01:15:51,167
For called Monopoly

1495
01:15:56,543 --> 01:15:59,103
In the end it wasn't the right episode and I accept that

1496
01:15:59,359 --> 01:16:04,223
However I did watch an episode of Gunsmoke in preparation for this episode

1497
01:16:04,479 --> 01:16:05,503
Not tell you about it

1498
01:16:09,343 --> 01:16:12,159
The episode was originally aired on October 4th

1499
01:16:12,671 --> 01:16:13,183
58

1500
01:16:13,439 --> 01:16:15,487
It's called

1501
01:16:15,999 --> 01:16:17,535
Monopoly

1502
01:16:17,791 --> 01:16:23,935
Course I did this is important even though this isn't the right episode 2 walkthrough hauben

1503
01:16:24,191 --> 01:16:25,215
Gunsmoke plot

1504
01:16:25,727 --> 01:16:27,519
About what they're about

1505
01:16:27,775 --> 01:16:28,287
If that makes sense

1506
01:16:29,311 --> 01:16:29,823
Okay

1507
01:16:30,079 --> 01:16:33,919
Sheriff Matt Dillon comes to work one day to find a lovable local character

1508
01:16:34,175 --> 01:16:35,711
Sleeping off of wicked drinking binge

1509
01:16:35,967 --> 01:16:36,991
Holding cell

1510
01:16:37,503 --> 01:16:40,575
The drunk wakes up and says he's leaving Dillon

1511
01:16:40,831 --> 01:16:44,159
Which is almost as referencing when he recently claimed

1512
01:16:44,415 --> 01:16:47,487
50 the cops will give you your guns back when you got out of prison

1513
01:16:47,743 --> 01:16:48,511
Holyshit

1514
01:16:48,767 --> 01:16:54,399
Small clarification. It was made in the 1950s but it's Dodge City Kansas

1515
01:16:54,911 --> 01:17:01,055
7070

1516
01:17:05,151 --> 01:17:05,663
288

1517
01:17:06,687 --> 01:17:08,479
70s what racism was there

1518
01:17:08,735 --> 01:17:10,271
Lots

1519
01:17:10,527 --> 01:17:11,295
All the time

1520
01:17:12,575 --> 01:17:15,135
Real hard swing Asian

1521
01:17:15,647 --> 01:17:16,927
Asian-American

1522
01:17:17,439 --> 01:17:20,767
Particularly

1523
01:17:21,791 --> 01:17:22,559
It makes me pretty

1524
01:17:33,311 --> 01:17:36,383
And so it pretty much all the other wagon cargo people

1525
01:17:36,639 --> 01:17:37,151
Allentown

1526
01:17:37,407 --> 01:17:40,735
The mysterious mr. Ivy it comes to town from St Louis

1527
01:17:42,783 --> 01:17:47,647
Everything and he's buying up everyone's business

1528
01:17:48,415 --> 01:17:54,559
So Dylan goes to meet with Ivy as lodging he finds out that he's hired Camp Spiegel as his bodyguard

1529
01:17:58,399 --> 01:18:04,543
Dylan and Spiegel have a history in the back years ago in Wichita

1530
01:18:04,799 --> 01:18:05,823
Got away with it because Dylan

1531
01:18:06,335 --> 01:18:07,103
Didn't have the evidence to

1532
01:18:07,359 --> 01:18:13,503
Victim

1533
01:18:13,759 --> 01:18:16,575
Spiegel's come to Dodge City and he's working for IV

1534
01:18:16,831 --> 01:18:17,855
This doesn't look good

1535
01:18:18,111 --> 01:18:24,255
Her doll

1536
01:18:24,511 --> 01:18:30,655
How do you leave the hotel room

1537
01:18:30,911 --> 01:18:32,959
He becomes a problem it might be too late

1538
01:18:34,495 --> 01:18:39,103
The last Freight Runner who hasn't sold out

1539
01:18:39,615 --> 01:18:40,383
He comes to Dylan

1540
01:18:40,895 --> 01:18:41,919
Received a note from ivy

1541
01:18:42,175 --> 01:18:43,199
Turns out he's a literate

1542
01:18:43,455 --> 01:18:44,479
I need Dylan

1543
01:18:44,735 --> 01:18:46,783
Oh no

1544
01:18:47,039 --> 01:18:49,855
Ivy wants to buy his company for $1,000

1545
01:18:50,367 --> 01:18:54,719
Which even with inflation considered would only be a little bit less than $20,000 a day

1546
01:18:54,975 --> 01:18:58,303
If you're running a business that sustains

1547
01:18:58,559 --> 01:19:02,143
It's not like that's going to be some kind of luxurious all be set for life money

1548
01:19:02,399 --> 01:19:04,191
Probably because that's not that much

1549
01:19:04,447 --> 01:19:05,727
Shmoney

1550
01:19:06,239 --> 01:19:09,567
Ivy leader tells him that he's going to double his rates

1551
01:19:09,823 --> 01:19:11,871
Apple needs to as well because

1552
01:19:12,127 --> 01:19:14,431
Call the flood

1553
01:19:14,687 --> 01:19:15,455
But he can't handle

1554
01:19:17,759 --> 01:19:18,271
But it doesn't matter

1555
01:19:18,783 --> 01:19:19,807
Cuz I have to stress

1556
01:19:20,063 --> 01:19:21,343
Is not a huge part of the episode

1557
01:19:21,599 --> 01:19:23,391
It's only there to be window dressing

1558
01:19:23,647 --> 01:19:24,415
For the feud between

1559
01:19:24,671 --> 01:19:26,463
Sheriff

1560
01:19:26,719 --> 01:19:27,231
Okay

1561
01:19:27,487 --> 01:19:30,047
V story short

1562
01:19:32,095 --> 01:19:38,239
Saloon girl $300 to be his alibi

1563
01:19:38,495 --> 01:19:41,055
Roadhouse

1564
01:19:41,311 --> 01:19:47,455
It scraped throat

1565
01:19:47,711 --> 01:19:48,991
Even with this craziness

1566
01:19:49,247 --> 01:19:49,759
This is still

1567
01:19:50,015 --> 01:19:51,551
Super Bowl

1568
01:19:52,575 --> 01:19:55,903
Saloon girl $300

1569
01:19:56,671 --> 01:19:59,743
Girl can't go around these parts

1570
01:19:59,999 --> 01:20:01,023
Love the trembles

1571
01:20:01,279 --> 01:20:02,815
Although I am

1572
01:20:04,863 --> 01:20:11,007
The actor who plays Tim from the characters of Gunsmoke

1573
01:20:11,263 --> 01:20:12,799
Gunsmoke was the Law & Order of a dick

1574
01:20:13,055 --> 01:20:16,640
Are they wouldn't even allowed appearances

1575
01:20:17,664 --> 01:20:21,248
Either way this little girl tells Dylan about the bribe

1576
01:20:21,504 --> 01:20:22,784
Confront

1577
01:20:23,040 --> 01:20:23,808
When you get to news.

1578
01:20:24,064 --> 01:20:26,112
It's beagle the SHOT show tremble at the local Saloon

1579
01:20:26,368 --> 01:20:31,488
Shot

1580
01:20:31,744 --> 01:20:33,024
Dylan goes to check things out

1581
01:20:33,280 --> 01:20:34,816
Spiegel claim self-defense

1582
01:20:43,008 --> 01:20:43,520
Drawing

1583
01:20:44,544 --> 01:20:45,312
Who killed his wife

1584
01:20:46,080 --> 01:20:48,640
Because he has an alibi Dylan tells him no

1585
01:20:48,896 --> 01:20:49,920
He knows about the bribe

1586
01:20:50,432 --> 01:20:54,784
Dylan

1587
01:20:55,552 --> 01:20:58,112
Spiegel starts to draw and Dylan and feeling shoot them dead

1588
01:20:58,624 --> 01:21:04,768
Who's there

1589
01:21:05,024 --> 01:21:09,888
In court which is a fuk

1590
01:21:10,144 --> 01:21:16,288
That was such a crazy person

1591
01:21:16,800 --> 01:21:17,312
Well

1592
01:21:17,568 --> 01:21:19,360
Probably would have been fine anyways

1593
01:21:19,616 --> 01:21:21,152
You would have gotten away with it

1594
01:21:21,664 --> 01:21:25,504
After all this drama IV claims he knew nothing about Spiegel's action

1595
01:21:25,760 --> 01:21:26,784
Dylan

1596
01:21:27,040 --> 01:21:28,064
Get the f*** out of town

1597
01:21:28,320 --> 01:21:30,368
The citizens of that China will kill him on sight

1598
01:21:30,624 --> 01:21:32,416
Because they love the trimbles who I repeat

1599
01:21:32,672 --> 01:21:36,000
Have not appeared in the previous episode

1600
01:21:36,256 --> 01:21:40,352
Noranda 480 episodes of its 11-year run is a radio drama

1601
01:21:41,632 --> 01:21:44,192
Is about a small town

1602
01:21:45,216 --> 01:21:48,800
Terrified

1603
01:21:49,056 --> 01:21:49,568
NeverBeast

1604
01:21:50,080 --> 01:21:52,640
Explicitly leaving behind the company that he had bought

1605
01:21:53,152 --> 01:21:59,296
Obviously the first issue is that care about the Monopoly

1606
01:22:00,320 --> 01:22:05,696
The closest he comes to it is commenting that

1607
01:22:05,952 --> 01:22:06,464
Is very proper

1608
01:22:06,976 --> 01:22:08,768
He doesn't care about that stuff

1609
01:22:09,024 --> 01:22:13,632
He only cares about Camp Spiegel and righting the wrongs of Wichita

1610
01:22:15,936 --> 01:22:18,240
It seems like

1611
01:22:19,264 --> 01:22:19,776
He's just

1612
01:22:20,032 --> 01:22:22,848
He's missing the point of Monopoly

1613
01:22:23,104 --> 01:22:28,992
So he's calling the guy stupid right

1614
01:22:35,648 --> 01:22:37,696
Subtext of the episode

1615
01:22:37,952 --> 01:22:40,256
He doesn't care at all

1616
01:22:41,024 --> 01:22:47,168
Now the natural problem with the ending of this episode

1617
01:22:47,424 --> 01:22:53,568
Go from an attempted literally no one in the city having transportation

1618
01:22:53,824 --> 01:22:58,688
Back from IV before you run

1619
01:22:58,944 --> 01:23:03,296
So if they take them

1620
01:23:03,552 --> 01:23:09,696
In the old west

1621
01:23:09,952 --> 01:23:14,816
It's mostly just about duels and people being found guilty by insinuation and ran out of town

1622
01:23:15,072 --> 01:23:21,216
Sebastian from

1623
01:23:21,728 --> 01:23:23,520
That's not the episode that Alex

1624
01:23:26,336 --> 01:23:29,152
But I didn't want my time to be wasted

1625
01:23:29,408 --> 01:23:35,040
Anyone is very entertaining

1626
01:23:36,576 --> 01:23:38,880
Roosevelt directed The Jump

1627
01:23:39,136 --> 01:23:40,416
Department sued in Northern security

1628
01:23:40,672 --> 01:23:42,720
Please company would you become a railroad Monopoly

1629
01:23:43,232 --> 01:23:46,048
Credit for Basta

1630
01:23:46,304 --> 01:23:46,816
Monopoly

1631
01:23:47,072 --> 01:23:47,584
Discography

1632
01:23:47,840 --> 01:23:48,608
As well

1633
01:23:49,120 --> 01:23:51,424
It's inappropriate to look at that

1634
01:23:51,680 --> 01:23:56,032
Executive it's always a good idea to look at the executive as being Prime

1635
01:23:56,288 --> 01:23:57,312
Mover behind

1636
01:23:57,568 --> 01:24:01,664
All positive or negative

1637
01:24:02,176 --> 01:24:02,688
Executive branch

1638
01:24:02,944 --> 01:24:03,456
Should be the business

1639
01:24:03,712 --> 01:24:04,224
Decided what

1640
01:24:06,528 --> 01:24:12,672
Whatever also also it's true that the Roosevelt was involved in this truck

1641
01:24:12,928 --> 01:24:14,976
Ignore that it wasn't present

1642
01:24:15,232 --> 01:24:17,024
Progressive Era

1643
01:24:19,328 --> 01:24:19,840
Sender in office

1644
01:24:21,120 --> 01:24:27,264
So

1645
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:28,544
Askreddit

1646
01:24:28,800 --> 01:24:32,128
About the Gunsmoke episode

1647
01:24:45,440 --> 01:24:45,952
What

1648
01:24:55,680 --> 01:24:56,704
Royal Farms

1649
01:24:56,960 --> 01:25:03,104
The big local corrupt guy wanted to take

1650
01:25:07,712 --> 01:25:10,784
The thousand-mile so he can make the money to save his farm

1651
01:25:14,368 --> 01:25:16,160
Takes him a month or so to get there

1652
01:25:18,464 --> 01:25:21,792
But they get stopped and then when he gets there he thinks all the pictures or dad

1653
01:25:22,048 --> 01:25:24,864
Under the first layer all the peaches are alive

1654
01:25:27,424 --> 01:25:27,936
What

1655
01:25:28,448 --> 01:25:29,216
Bistro

1656
01:25:29,472 --> 01:25:29,984
Still not

1657
01:25:30,752 --> 01:25:31,776
Bathurst

1658
01:25:33,568 --> 01:25:37,152
Okay

1659
01:25:41,504 --> 01:25:45,856
Gunsmoke and Bonanza

1660
01:25:51,744 --> 01:25:54,816
Right the wrongs of my battery

1661
01:25:55,072 --> 01:25:57,120
But it's not available online anywhere that I can

1662
01:25:57,376 --> 01:25:58,656
I can find but I did read

1663
01:26:00,192 --> 01:26:01,216
Eminent domain

1664
01:26:01,984 --> 01:26:08,128
Doesn't really have to do with monopolies in the idea of

1665
01:26:08,384 --> 01:26:08,896
Breaking up

1666
01:26:16,064 --> 01:26:17,600
Ranger technology

1667
01:26:18,880 --> 01:26:20,416
That was where I was

1668
01:26:21,440 --> 01:26:21,952
This is troubling

1669
01:26:22,208 --> 01:26:22,976
This next clip

1670
01:26:23,232 --> 01:26:24,256
I legitimately think

1671
01:26:24,768 --> 01:26:25,536
Is one of the more

1672
01:26:25,792 --> 01:26:27,072
Disturbed things I've ever heard

1673
01:26:28,096 --> 01:26:28,608
This cup is f*****

1674
01:26:35,520 --> 01:26:41,664
Trivia

1675
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:50,624
Can release the biome

1676
01:26:50,880 --> 01:26:53,184
God has to remove his protection

1677
01:26:57,536 --> 01:27:00,608
The devil would nucleus planet in 10 seconds

1678
01:27:01,632 --> 01:27:02,656
Did not remove his protection

1679
01:27:05,472 --> 01:27:06,496
But for 1 hour

1680
01:27:22,880 --> 01:27:25,952
I want to know what's going to happen next

1681
01:27:26,208 --> 01:27:26,976
Boom commercial

1682
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:30,816
He doesn't get back to us

1683
01:27:31,840 --> 01:27:35,680
That's upsetting upsetting

1684
01:27:37,472 --> 01:27:43,616
Yeah they're going to Nuke the planet release race specific bioweapons

1685
01:27:43,872 --> 01:27:50,016
I can't because of God's protection is going to remove an hour

1686
01:27:50,272 --> 01:27:53,600
.

1687
01:27:53,856 --> 01:27:55,392
Your s*** about time

1688
01:27:59,744 --> 01:28:03,584
Omniscient and omnipotent

1689
01:28:03,840 --> 01:28:04,352
Just outside of

1690
01:28:10,240 --> 01:28:11,520
The consequences of that are going to last

1691
01:28:11,776 --> 01:28:15,360
Way longer than ours as

1692
01:28:15,616 --> 01:28:21,248
Arbitrary

1693
01:28:21,504 --> 01:28:24,832
Also

1694
01:28:25,088 --> 01:28:31,232
Deeply implied by that cut off by commercial is that he knows when that's going to happen

1695
01:28:31,488 --> 01:28:37,632
Preparing preparing for protection

1696
01:28:37,888 --> 01:28:39,424
An hour Devil's attack

1697
01:28:39,680 --> 01:28:40,704
Alex prepared

1698
01:28:40,960 --> 01:28:42,240
Totally cool

1699
01:28:42,496 --> 01:28:44,288
That's Disturbed

1700
01:28:45,312 --> 01:28:50,176
That is very f*****-up way of thinking

1701
01:28:53,760 --> 01:28:54,528
It's a level

1702
01:28:56,064 --> 01:28:56,832
Untethered

1703
01:28:57,600 --> 01:28:58,624
You hear that

1704
01:28:59,648 --> 01:29:02,208
A lot of crazy stuff before but

1705
01:29:02,464 --> 01:29:03,232
Get to that level

1706
01:29:10,144 --> 01:29:12,704
That definitely isn't

1707
01:29:12,960 --> 01:29:13,472
Foreign to us

1708
01:29:14,496 --> 01:29:16,544
Him coming out and saying gato released

1709
01:29:16,800 --> 01:29:18,336
Protection for an hour and that's when we're going to

1710
01:29:18,592 --> 01:29:19,360
Hit

1711
01:29:20,128 --> 01:29:20,640
That is

1712
01:29:21,152 --> 01:29:21,664
Pretty

1713
01:29:22,432 --> 01:29:22,944
Creative

1714
01:29:23,456 --> 01:29:26,272
Also also

1715
01:29:26,528 --> 01:29:29,600
Protection is the only thing keeping us from being nuked

1716
01:29:29,856 --> 01:29:30,880
And hit by biome

1717

Yes which implies that God can protect

1718

But isn't that our

01:29:36,512 --> 01:29:38,048
Yeah and also

1720
01:29:38,304 --> 01:29:41,888
Doesn't for the rest of the horrible things that go up

01:30:04,416 --> 01:30:06,208
Through it unfortunately I can't

The present day

Dip his toe into a story that I started looking at

1731
01:30:17,984 --> 01:30:21,312
Very interesting requires

1732
01:30:21,568 --> 01:30:22,080
Unpacking

1734
01:30:31,808 --> 01:30:33,088
Did you switch

01:30:34,624 --> 01:30:39,744
You're borgia.com, exclusively there

Russell's Buster suspension Sunoco station

Ono immigrants bring disease

1739
01:31:08,928 --> 01:31:09,696
The window dressing

Another bus stop because of

1746
01:31:28,128 --> 01:31:30,176
In order to understand the story that Alex

1747
01:31:30,432 --> 01:31:32,224
Understand

1748
01:31:32,480 --> 01:31:33,248
Surrounding context

1749
01:31:34,016 --> 01:31:35,296
I'm going to

1750
01:31:35,552 --> 01:31:38,624
Truth there is a story he's covering in a Belgian news Outlet

1751
01:31:38,880 --> 01:31:41,952
It does discuss the plan to not have buses stop at the North State

1752
01:31:42,208 --> 01:31:43,232
Patient the garden

1753
01:31:43,488 --> 01:31:45,792

1754
01:31:46,048 --> 01:31:48,352
Hilarious brick

1755
01:31:49,376 --> 01:31:51,168
But as is always the case

1756
01:31:51,424 --> 01:31:52,448
There's more to the story

1757
01:31:52,704 --> 01:31:54,496
He cares to understand

1758
01:31:55,008 --> 01:31:59,360
There's a large population of itinerant immigrants or is there called transmigrant

1759
01:31:59,616 --> 01:32:02,432
Who are for lack of a better word stuck

1760
01:32:03,456 --> 01:32:07,808
Even flight from various countries of turmoil ultimately arriving in Europe

1761
01:32:08,576 --> 01:32:10,112
North to Belgium

1762
01:32:10,368 --> 01:32:12,672
Many of them finding it almost impossible to make

1763
01:32:14,976 --> 01:32:17,024
Where they feel they would have less of it

1764
01:32:18,304 --> 01:32:19,328
Sent back to where they originated

1765
01:32:19,584 --> 01:32:21,632
For many of them it's as simple as

1766
01:32:21,888 --> 01:32:23,424
Improper

1767
01:32:23,680 --> 01:32:24,704
Application to make the trip

1768
01:32:24,960 --> 01:32:26,240
Awesome because

1769
01:32:28,288 --> 01:32:28,800
Fled

1770
01:32:30,080 --> 01:32:30,848
Mosey on out

1771
01:32:31,872 --> 01:32:35,200
Some others wish to stay in Belgium butter afraid to apply for Asylum

1772
01:32:35,456 --> 01:32:41,600
Apply only government

Specifically rule called the

1774
01:32:46,208 --> 01:32:49,536
Supposed to deport Asylum Seekers back to their home country

1775
01:32:50,048 --> 01:32:51,840
But under the right circumstance

1776
01:32:52,352 --> 01:32:52,864
They're allowed

1777
01:32:53,120 --> 01:32:53,632
To send them back

1778
01:32:54,144 --> 01:32:55,680
First EU country they arrived

1779
01:32:56,192 --> 01:32:58,752
For many of these immigrants in picture of that would be Italy

1780
01:32:59,264 --> 01:33:01,056
And there's a reason they didn't just say

01:33:01,824 --> 01:33:04,128
Dakota twenty-five-year-old Sudanese man

Financial Times

1783

Conditions are bad

1784
01:33:07,968 --> 01:33:09,504
You stay in the camp and there is no

1785
01:33:10,528 --> 01:33:14,624
They don't want to risk applying for Asylum only to be sent back to Italy where they'll be putting a

1786
01:33:15,392 --> 01:33:15,904
And they can't make

1787
01:33:16,160 --> 01:33:17,440
The trip cross the English Channel

1788
01:33:17,696 --> 01:33:18,976
Weird in-between

1789
01:33:19,488 --> 01:33:20,256
States

1790
01:33:21,024 --> 01:33:24,096
Human rights Charities work with people

1792
01:33:28,960 --> 01:33:30,496
From the Dublin rule cuz many are

1793
01:33:32,032 --> 01:33:33,824
The process and apply for Asylum

1794
01:33:34,080 --> 01:33:36,384
Which give the positive indication about a Direction

1795
01:33:36,640 --> 01:33:37,408
Forward there could be

1796
01:33:37,664 --> 01:33:38,176
First Progress

1797
01:33:38,432 --> 01:33:39,456
Yeah

1798
01:33:39,712 --> 01:33:41,504
But they're even greater risk

1799
01:33:43,552 --> 01:33:44,576
Because even though they're not

1800
01:33:44,832 --> 01:33:45,856
Supposed to do so generally

1801
01:33:46,368 --> 01:33:48,416
Sometimes refugees are deported back to the country

1802
01:33:48,672 --> 01:33:49,184
Left

1803
01:33:49,440 --> 01:33:52,000
Edit 2017

1804
01:33:52,256 --> 01:33:52,768
The flare up

1805
01:33:53,024 --> 01:33:54,560
After their allegations that people who

1806
01:33:54,816 --> 01:33:55,328
Snapbacks

Hibbett tortured when they return

1808
01:33:58,144 --> 01:34:01,984
These people were sent despite warnings from international human rights groups

1809
01:34:03,264 --> 01:34:06,592
The government indicated that they were aware that some of the people who were sent back

1810
01:34:06,848 --> 01:34:07,616
We're from the regents

1811
01:34:07,872 --> 01:34:08,384
Refer

Which at made them automatic recipients

01:34:14,016 --> 01:34:14,528
It's status

1815
01:34:14,784 --> 01:34:15,808
The government's motivation

1816
01:34:16,576 --> 01:34:17,344
Quote cleaning up

1817
01:34:17,600 --> 01:34:20,160
Public areas where immigrants

1818
01:34:20,416 --> 01:34:20,928

01:34:25,280 --> 01:34:27,072
It's probably on clear off the

1823
01:34:27,328 --> 01:34:30,656
The back here why there would be large populations

1824
01:34:31,168 --> 01:34:32,192
Coming to this Garden

1825
01:34:35,264 --> 01:34:36,544
Just think it's where the train just

1826
01:34:36,800 --> 01:34:38,592
Barks so they get off the train

1827
01:34:40,384 --> 01:34:41,152
That's not true

1828
01:34:41,920 --> 01:34:44,992
Immigrants come to Garden North specifically because it's an

1829
01:34:45,248 --> 01:34:46,528

Help help

1839
01:35:06,752 --> 01:35:08,032

The psychological service

1847
01:35:21,088 --> 01:35:22,624
Aspect of this is really crucial

1848
01:35:23,136 --> 01:35:24,928
According to psychologist who works

1849
01:35:25,184 --> 01:35:26,208
But the humanitarian hub

1850
01:35:26,464 --> 01:35:29,792
Kisima trend of immigrants developing depression based on harsh dissolute

Perfumed right

1852
01:35:33,376 --> 01:35:35,424
They're completely disillusion

1853
01:35:35,936 --> 01:35:38,240
They never imagined that they'd be sleeping outside and

1854
01:35:38,496 --> 01:35:39,520
With a rule of law

1855
01:35:40,544 --> 01:35:41,824
So that's a little bit of a bummer

1856
01:35:43,360 --> 01:35:43,872
Yeah

1857
01:35:44,128 --> 01:35:48,992
It's a bummer but it's also part and parcel of a reality that there are these people

1858
01:35:49,248 --> 01:35:52,064
Providing the scalp and that's why there are large groups

1859

They love everyone and we return that feeling

Something to help mitigate the problem and that is a very inspiring

That they were part of which included the prime minister

1905
01:37:52,640 --> 01:37:56,480
The bad news is that they left the route

1906
01:37:59,808 --> 01:38:02,112
Because prime minister Charles Michel

1907
01:38:02,368 --> 01:38:05,184
Refused the new Farmers alliances demand that he

1908
01:38:05,696 --> 01:38:08,256
His plan just you and migration

1909
01:38:09,280 --> 01:38:11,328
Member states other than the US

1910
01:38:12,352 --> 01:38:14,144
And because Michelle just

1911
01:38:16,704 --> 01:38:17,216
In Flemish

1912
01:38:17,472 --> 01:38:18,496
Pulled out of his government

1913
01:38:19,264 --> 01:38:20,032
This is

1914
01:38:20,288 --> 01:38:24,384
Because there's still the largest political representative

1915
01:38:27,712 --> 01:38:28,736
The phobic

1916
01:38:28,992 --> 01:38:30,528
It push further hard right

1917
01:38:30,784 --> 01:38:31,552
It's concern

1918
01:38:32,320 --> 01:38:33,088
A what are the reason

1919
01:38:35,392 --> 01:38:37,440
It's a hold on to their far-right face

1920
01:38:37,696 --> 01:38:41,536
Which is starting to be eroded more f***** up

1921
01:38:41,792 --> 01:38:42,304
70s party

1922
01:38:42,560 --> 01:38:43,584
Blom's belong

1923
01:38:44,608 --> 01:38:48,448
Heart rate for a nationalist parties are starting from an unfair advantage

1924
01:38:49,472 --> 01:38:51,520
Visit their movement traces its roots to the

1925
01:38:51,776 --> 01:38:55,616
Movie post-world War World

1926
01:38:55,872 --> 01:38:56,640
It's called the front part

1927
01:38:57,408 --> 01:39:01,760
Well the party may have been started with Flemish representation is a front

1928
01:39:02,272 --> 01:39:02,784
Are we going to

1929
01:39:03,040 --> 01:39:03,552
Call boy

1930
01:39:03,808 --> 01:39:06,880
They started with an interest in Flemish representation

1931
01:39:07,136 --> 01:39:07,904
Is being a primary

1932
01:39:08,160 --> 01:39:10,720
Concerned by the early 1930s

1933
01:39:10,976 --> 01:39:12,000
Pretty far right

1934
01:39:12,256 --> 01:39:14,304
Activate absorbed by the Flemish National Union

1935
01:39:14,816 --> 01:39:18,144
An explicitly authoritarian party that were over collaborators with

1936
01:39:18,400 --> 01:39:19,680
The Nazis in World War II

1937
01:39:19,936 --> 01:39:22,240
Because Hitler had promised them greater Flemish right

1938
01:39:23,264 --> 01:39:24,288
It deserves mention

1939
01:39:24,544 --> 01:39:26,336
Did VNV that's there

1940
01:39:26,592 --> 01:39:27,104
Initials

1941
01:39:27,360 --> 01:39:27,872
Fiat

1942
01:39:28,128 --> 01:39:28,896
The Flemish Nation

1943
01:39:29,152 --> 01:39:31,712
Union pob l

1944
01:39:32,992 --> 01:39:34,528
I was collaborating with the Nazis

1945
01:39:34,784 --> 01:39:36,320
Before they invaded Belgium

1946
01:39:36,832 --> 01:39:38,112
With the hopes that they could help him

1947
01:39:39,136 --> 01:39:41,440
Which led directly to his party organized

1948
01:39:41,696 --> 01:39:42,464
The deportation of Jews

1949
01:39:43,744 --> 01:39:46,048
So you can see how that history gives people a little bit

1950
01:39:46,304 --> 01:39:47,840
Hard right nationalist

1951
01:39:48,096 --> 01:39:49,120
Flemish National

1952
01:39:49,376 --> 01:39:49,888
Sparty's

1953
01:39:50,656 --> 01:39:56,544
After the liberation of Belgium by the Allied Powers the VNV was outlawed as a political party for Fairly obvious

1954
01:39:57,568 --> 01:39:58,592
This led to the rise of

1955
01:39:58,848 --> 01:40:00,128
The Christian Flemish people

1956
01:40:00,640 --> 01:40:01,152
Wageworks

1957
01:40:01,408 --> 01:40:02,944
To make sure that they were nationalist

1958
01:40:03,200 --> 01:40:05,760
But also didn't put anyone in office would collaborated

1959
01:40:08,832 --> 01:40:10,112
That was nice of them

1960
01:40:10,368 --> 01:40:12,416
It's an interesting proposition

1961
01:40:12,672 --> 01:40:13,184
Do you know what

1962
01:40:14,208 --> 01:40:18,560
Oliver North

1963
01:40:19,072 --> 01:40:22,144
Oliver didn't hire him

1964
01:40:25,728 --> 01:40:29,568
The grouping nationalist in nature but also fairly moderate left in Polish

1965
01:40:30,336 --> 01:40:36,480
So a lot of folks jumpship which would eventually be merged

1966
01:40:36,736 --> 01:40:37,504
Block

1967
01:40:38,272 --> 01:40:42,368
The block was a very specifically anti-immigrant far hard right National

1968
01:40:42,624 --> 01:40:43,136
Party

1969
01:40:43,392 --> 01:40:46,720
Their slogan in the 1987 election was quote

1970
01:40:46,976 --> 01:40:53,120
Which sounds really bad one Splendid the word

1971
01:40:53,376 --> 01:40:59,520
Our own Drake.

1972
01:41:00,032 --> 01:41:01,056
The Party founded

1973
01:41:01,312 --> 01:41:03,616
Success with focusing on immigration issues as opposed

1974
01:41:03,872 --> 01:41:05,664
Stop harping too hard on Flemish

1975
01:41:06,176 --> 01:41:09,504
In the same way that our right-wing May profess an interest in small confirm it

1976
01:41:09,760 --> 01:41:15,136
More effective as an electoral strategy

1977
01:41:15,904 --> 01:41:17,952
And it worked well for The Lawns block

1978
01:41:18,208 --> 01:41:23,072
Growing from relative obscurity political party by the late night

1979
01:41:24,352 --> 01:41:25,376
Then the year 2000

1980
01:41:26,656 --> 01:41:31,776
A complaint was filed against the party broke Belgium

1981
01:41:32,032 --> 01:41:32,544
Platform

1982
01:41:32,800 --> 01:41:35,360
We hate everyone that bite based on race

1983
01:41:35,616 --> 01:41:39,968
For an entirely separate educational system

1984
01:41:40,224 --> 01:41:40,992
A foreign children

1985
01:41:41,504 --> 01:41:44,576
New taxes for businesses that hired non-european foreigners

1986
01:41:45,088 --> 01:41:45,600
And restrict

1987
01:41:45,856 --> 01:41:47,648
Benefits for non-european

1988
01:41:47,904 --> 01:41:48,416
Foreigner

1989
01:41:48,928 --> 01:41:52,000
The case of bounced around courts until 2004

1990
01:41:53,536 --> 01:41:54,304
The court of cassation

1991
01:41:54,560 --> 01:41:56,864
Ruled that their party platform was

1992
01:41:57,120 --> 01:41:57,632
Racist

1993
01:41:58,144 --> 01:42:03,008
Are effectively disbanded the Party by

1994
01:42:05,056 --> 01:42:05,568
Put their tails

1995
01:42:05,824 --> 01:42:06,336
Between their legs

1996
01:42:06,592 --> 01:42:08,640
You can just move.

1997
01:42:08,896 --> 01:42:13,760
Television

1998
01:42:14,016 --> 01:42:16,832
The state funding of Elections if they aren't

1999
01:42:17,088 --> 01:42:19,904
Access to that money

2000
01:42:23,232 --> 01:42:29,376
Groundhog

2001
01:42:29,632 --> 01:42:33,472
F****** they reorganized in 2004 Islam's belong

2002
01:42:33,984 --> 01:42:35,264
Which is now the party

2003
01:42:35,520 --> 01:42:37,824
Is challenging the new Flemish Alliance from the right

2004
01:42:38,336 --> 01:42:41,664
So you can kind of see how this all fits together a little bit better now

2005
01:42:41,920 --> 01:42:43,456
The situation

2006
01:42:46,784 --> 01:42:48,832
You are not going far enough we want to kill him

2007
01:42:49,088 --> 01:42:52,160
Interesting conversation

2008
01:42:52,672 --> 01:42:54,464
What are the members of the new Flemish Alliance

2009
01:42:54,720 --> 01:42:58,304
Government was their migration Minister Theo Franken

2010
01:42:58,560 --> 01:43:00,864
Who incidentally was the one responsible for Sunday

2011
01:43:01,120 --> 01:43:01,632
Protected record

2012
01:43:01,888 --> 01:43:02,912
Bee Gees back to the sedan

2013
01:43:03,168 --> 01:43:03,680
To be tortured

2014
01:43:04,448 --> 01:43:06,496
Michelle government Franklin

2015
01:43:06,752 --> 01:43:08,544
Play in baking

2016
01:43:08,800 --> 01:43:10,592
I'm sure that the issue of gardener.

2017
01:43:10,848 --> 01:43:11,872
In Brussels was not

2018
01:43:12,128 --> 01:43:12,640
Taken care of

2019
01:43:13,152 --> 01:43:14,176
His new Flemish Alliance

2020
01:43:14,432 --> 01:43:16,224
To the hard right position on immigration wishes

2021
01:43:16,480 --> 01:43:17,248
The Punisher deporte

2022
01:43:17,504 --> 01:43:18,272
People not

2023
01:43:18,528 --> 01:43:19,040
To help them

2024
01:43:19,296 --> 01:43:22,112
Another reason groups like logs belong

2025
01:43:22,368 --> 01:43:25,696
Happy to make out to be even further right

2026
01:43:25,952 --> 01:43:27,232
To make sure that he's not evil

2027
01:43:27,488 --> 01:43:28,000
Forgiven

2028
01:43:29,024 --> 01:43:29,536
Does

2029
01:43:29,792 --> 01:43:30,816
They start attacking them from the right

2030
01:43:31,584 --> 01:43:32,352
The terrible situation

2031
01:43:33,376 --> 01:43:35,424
The party with the most members in Brussels parlor

2032
01:43:35,936 --> 01:43:36,448
The local

2033
01:43:36,960 --> 01:43:37,472
Brussels

2034
01:43:37,728 --> 01:43:38,496
Is the Socialist

2035
01:43:39,264 --> 01:43:41,824
A large majority of the members of body are not hard right now

2036
01:43:42,336 --> 01:43:43,104
Most of them

2037
01:43:43,872 --> 01:43:46,432
Members of the brothels Parliament

2038
01:43:46,688 --> 01:43:49,248
Alleviate what is prices for these

2039
01:43:50,528 --> 01:43:54,368
But it'd be pretty vocal that they can't solve any problems without federal government

2040
01:43:54,624 --> 01:43:55,136
Cooperation

2041
01:43:55,904 --> 01:43:57,440
There's just that there's collaboration that

2042
01:43:57,952 --> 01:43:58,464
To be done

2043
01:43:58,976 --> 01:43:59,488
To that

2044
01:43:59,744 --> 01:44:00,768
Complaints

2045
01:44:01,024 --> 01:44:02,048
And request

2046
01:44:02,560 --> 01:44:06,656
New Flemish Alliance migration Minister c.l. Franklin

2047
01:44:06,912 --> 01:44:07,680
0 euros

2048
01:44:08,192 --> 01:44:09,728
I've always been against this migration

2049
01:44:09,984 --> 01:44:11,776
Can hubs

2050
01:44:12,032 --> 01:44:16,640
If Brussels wants to be for illegal transfer they should go ahead but not at

2051
01:44:16,896 --> 01:44:17,920
Sixpence of the federal government

2052
01:44:18,688 --> 01:44:19,200
He doesn't give a s***

2053
01:44:19,712 --> 01:44:22,016
Folks like this only care about you

2054
01:44:22,272 --> 01:44:25,856
Escalate to the point where they feel that they can rationalize dealing with their problem

2055
01:44:27,648 --> 01:44:28,928
So the problem has been allowed

2056
01:44:30,208 --> 01:44:31,744
So I know this is been bomb

2057
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:34,048
But I think it's important to understand the forces

2058
01:44:34,304 --> 01:44:35,072
Does a play when we see

2059
01:44:35,328 --> 01:44:37,888
Situations be lied about

2060
01:44:38,144 --> 01:44:38,656
Said our country

2061
01:44:39,168 --> 01:44:43,264
We live in a place where most of us are incredibly unaware About Belgium

2062
01:44:43,520 --> 01:44:44,544
And the day today

2063
01:44:47,616 --> 01:44:48,128
Easy to manipulate

2064
01:44:49,408 --> 01:44:52,736
Forum events are often the most fertile soil for local propaganda

2065
01:44:52,992 --> 01:44:54,016
Because the disconnect

2066
01:44:54,272 --> 01:44:57,088
Involved and almost guaranteed ignorance of the topic

2067
01:44:57,344 --> 01:44:57,856
And your listener

2068
01:44:58,624 --> 01:45:00,416
This is why Alex loves to try to

2069
01:45:00,672 --> 01:45:01,696
Statistics from the UK

2070
01:45:03,232 --> 01:45:04,512
Knowing his audience won't look.

2071
01:45:06,816 --> 01:45:08,096
Contact behind the data

2072
01:45:08,352 --> 01:45:09,376
And the same is true

2073
01:45:09,632 --> 01:45:11,168
Situation here at the Garden.

2074
01:45:11,424 --> 01:45:11,936
A Brussels

2075
01:45:13,472 --> 01:45:16,544
All all the situation is

2076
01:45:17,056 --> 01:45:17,824
The forces at play

2077
01:45:19,872 --> 01:45:22,688
Time from what I've been able to sort out from the reporting ivory

2078
01:45:23,712 --> 01:45:26,016
The fact that buses are saying that they are going to stop

2079
01:45:26,528 --> 01:45:27,040
Station

2080
01:45:27,296 --> 01:45:27,808
Does

2081
01:45:28,064 --> 01:45:28,576
Appear to be

2082
01:45:29,088 --> 01:45:29,600
Actually accurate

2083
01:45:30,112 --> 01:45:31,648
However it should be pointed out that it's not the

2084
01:45:31,904 --> 01:45:32,928
Government

2085
01:45:33,184 --> 01:45:33,696
On the bus

2086
01:45:35,744 --> 01:45:41,120
The union that represents Transportation employees decided that they weren't going to be stopping at the underground bus terminal there

2087
01:45:41,376 --> 01:45:44,192
Instead rerooting to nearby

2088
01:45:45,216 --> 01:45:48,288
In an article in the Brussels time

2089
01:45:48,544 --> 01:45:49,568
Concerns about scabies and

2090
01:45:51,104 --> 01:45:52,384
And there's literally no

2091
01:45:52,896 --> 01:45:53,408
Either disease

2092
01:45:53,920 --> 01:45:55,200
And I did

2093
01:45:55,456 --> 01:45:56,992
The group that runs the bus

2094
01:45:57,504 --> 01:46:00,576
Federal Public Health Ministry

2095
01:46:01,600 --> 01:46:02,368
Just an unfounded rumor

2096
01:46:03,648 --> 01:46:04,416
The real issue

2097
01:46:04,672 --> 01:46:05,696
Comes down to complaints

2098
01:46:05,952 --> 01:46:06,464
It's from customers

2099
01:46:06,720 --> 01:46:10,048
About the smell the litter and being hit up by train

2100
01:46:11,328 --> 01:46:13,120
There's a climate where people don't steal

2101
01:46:15,168 --> 01:46:15,936
These rumors appeared

2102
01:46:16,192 --> 01:46:16,960
It was enough Justice

2103
01:46:17,216 --> 01:46:17,728
Navigation for the train

2104
01:46:19,776 --> 01:46:25,920
Unfortunately I placed at the buses to Rhode gear S2

2105
01:46:27,200 --> 01:46:29,248
Who's mayor in New York year is not happy

2106
01:46:29,504 --> 01:46:30,528
Mobility problems

2107
01:46:31,040 --> 01:46:32,064
Traffic has brought with it

2108
01:46:33,344 --> 01:46:34,112
Stop the buses for

2109
01:46:34,368 --> 01:46:35,136
I'm stopping at a city

2110
01:46:35,392 --> 01:46:36,416
Compressor

2111
01:46:36,672 --> 01:46:39,488
Quotes comprehensible in unacceptable

2112
01:46:39,744 --> 01:46:42,816
The federal government to abandon place as important as a gardener

2113
01:46:43,328 --> 01:46:47,168
I call on all parties involved to find a sustainable and worthy solution for everyone

2114
01:46:47,936 --> 01:46:49,472
So I'm not entirely sure

2115
01:46:49,728 --> 01:46:50,752
Exactly what's going on

2116
01:46:51,008 --> 01:46:52,800
Kind of like a good strategy

2117
01:46:53,056 --> 01:46:56,128
Might be effective in getting the local or federal

2118
01:46:57,152 --> 01:47:03,040
The idea of a queef ruriiro to these buses here and I know you're not

2119
01:47:03,296 --> 01:47:04,832
I'm not entirely sure but time will tell

2120
01:47:06,112 --> 01:47:07,648
The reality of the situation of brothels

2121
01:47:08,160 --> 01:47:09,184
Incredibly complicated

2122
01:47:09,440 --> 01:47:12,000
Helped immensely by a government that was

2123
01:47:12,256 --> 01:47:12,768
To do what it needed

2124
01:47:13,024 --> 01:47:13,536
To do to help

2125
01:47:13,792 --> 01:47:14,304
Crisis

2126
01:47:14,816 --> 01:47:17,888
A huge step forward to be removing the fear that many of these refugees

2127
01:47:18,400 --> 01:47:20,192
Have applying for Belgian Asylum

2128
01:47:20,448 --> 01:47:24,032
If they knew that it wouldn't result in them being sent back to a country where they might face

2129
01:47:24,288 --> 01:47:24,800
Torture

2130
01:47:25,312 --> 01:47:26,080
Or Bachelorette

2131
01:47:27,360 --> 01:47:29,152
It could go a long way to getting them up back

2132
01:47:30,432 --> 01:47:32,736
Removal of that threat could be a big step forward

2133
01:47:33,248 --> 01:47:34,528
He'll be nice if a steak

2134
01:47:34,784 --> 01:47:37,088
Could help with getting those who wanted to apply for Asylum

2135
01:47:37,600 --> 01:47:39,904
UK

2136
01:47:40,160 --> 01:47:41,184
For instance like a lot of them

2137
01:47:46,048 --> 01:47:47,072
It would be decried by

2138
01:47:47,840 --> 01:47:48,864
Read politicians

2139
01:47:52,704 --> 01:47:56,288
It doesn't you're already already losing their minds

2140
01:47:56,544 --> 01:47:57,312
It doesn't seem realistic

2141
01:47:57,568 --> 01:47:59,360
Belgium

2142
01:48:02,944 --> 01:48:03,712
If only for that

2143
01:48:04,992 --> 01:48:07,040
So that was

2144
01:48:07,296 --> 01:48:08,064
Is a complex story

2145
01:48:08,576 --> 01:48:12,160
Oh sorry also adding to the complex

2146
01:48:13,440 --> 01:48:14,464
Itinerary immigrant

2147
01:48:14,720 --> 01:48:15,488
It's better there at the station

2148
01:48:15,744 --> 01:48:17,536
It's also homeless Belgian citizen

2149
01:48:17,792 --> 01:48:19,584
Likes it there's a larger issue

2150
01:48:19,840 --> 01:48:20,864
I'm here than just a migration

2151
01:48:21,632 --> 01:48:22,656
Alex refuses to look at NE

2152
01:48:23,680 --> 01:48:25,472
You really look at what's going on

2153
01:48:25,984 --> 01:48:27,008
The hard-right Nationalist

2154
01:48:27,264 --> 01:48:28,288
Are not the good guys

2155
01:48:32,640 --> 01:48:35,200
He says he hits the point

2156
01:48:35,456 --> 01:48:36,736
That are convenient to his married

2157
01:48:37,248 --> 01:48:39,808
He pulls out that there's a disease go in an immigrant

2158
01:48:41,088 --> 01:48:43,136
Push the immigrants are called

2159
01:48:43,392 --> 01:48:44,672
Narrative in recent weeks

2160
01:48:45,184 --> 01:48:46,464
And that's only really cares about

2161
01:48:46,720 --> 01:48:47,488
Stories

2162
01:48:48,512 --> 01:48:49,792
Just fit with his narrative

2163
01:48:50,560 --> 01:48:51,072
He's a month

2164
01:48:51,584 --> 01:48:53,888
Push Broderick it will serve to demonize population

2165
01:48:54,400 --> 01:48:56,704
There's literally no excuse

2166
01:48:59,008 --> 01:48:59,520
For someone

2167
01:49:00,800 --> 01:49:02,592
The people were routinely kept for months

2168
01:49:03,104 --> 01:49:03,616
Ellis Island

2169
01:49:12,576 --> 01:49:17,440
A little bit about Ellis Island from their medical screening

2170
01:49:17,696 --> 01:49:18,720
Specifically

2171
01:49:20,000 --> 01:49:22,304
German article in the American Medical Association

2172
01:49:22,560 --> 01:49:23,072
Journal of epic

2173
01:49:23,840 --> 01:49:26,912
The diagnostic protocol emphasized

2174
01:49:27,168 --> 01:49:27,680
Gave

2175
01:49:27,936 --> 01:49:31,008
Demonstrating the conviction that disease was written on the body

2176
01:49:31,520 --> 01:49:35,104
Dr. Albert Newt argued that quote almost No Grave organic

2177
01:49:35,360 --> 01:49:37,920
Disease can have hold on an individual without Staffing

2178
01:49:38,176 --> 01:49:40,736
Some evidence of its presence upon the appearance of a patient

2179
01:49:43,040 --> 01:49:44,064
Observer

2180
01:49:45,344 --> 01:49:49,440
They've basically relied almost entirely on looking at people

2181
01:49:50,720 --> 01:49:52,512
You get on his various camp

2182
01:49:59,680 --> 01:50:01,984
Typically 15 to 20% of the arrivals

2183
01:50:02,240 --> 01:50:04,544
Physical or mental examination

2184
01:50:05,824 --> 01:50:08,384
Of all the people were found to be sick this is.

2185
01:50:09,408 --> 01:50:12,736
Which is just a small percentage

2186
01:50:13,504 --> 01:50:16,320
Percent

2187
01:50:16,576 --> 01:50:17,600
And sometimes years

2188
01:50:17,856 --> 01:50:20,416
In the isolation units in the southernmost wing of Ellis Island

2189
01:50:22,208 --> 01:50:22,720
4 years

2190
01:50:23,488 --> 01:50:25,536
Very few very small

2191
01:50:26,816 --> 01:50:29,120
A lot of it was under metal

2192
01:50:29,888 --> 01:50:32,192
Chronic

2193
01:50:32,448 --> 01:50:33,216
Or severe condition

2194
01:50:33,472 --> 01:50:33,984
Right

2195
01:50:35,776 --> 01:50:36,544
Berries

2196
01:50:39,104 --> 01:50:40,384
A number

2197
01:50:41,408 --> 01:50:42,688
Less severe conditions

2198
01:50:42,944 --> 01:50:43,968
Might be held for a week

2199
01:50:46,016 --> 01:50:47,296
Will there be held in these cells

2200
01:50:48,320 --> 01:50:49,344
Apply for Hospital treat

2201
01:50:49,600 --> 01:50:51,136
Mexico

2202
01:50:51,392 --> 01:50:52,416
To pay for it themselves

2203
01:50:52,672 --> 01:50:54,976
And ultimately most of the people who were treated for disease

2204
01:50:55,232 --> 01:50:56,000
Ellis Island

2205
01:50:56,256 --> 01:50:57,280
Were deported

2206
01:50:57,536 --> 01:50:59,328
Not because they were sick but because they

2207
01:50:59,584 --> 01:51:00,608
They couldn't pay for their own hop

2208
01:51:00,864 --> 01:51:01,376
Fertilization

2209
01:51:01,888 --> 01:51:08,032
So a lot of the people that I was referring to the very small numbers

2210
01:51:08,288 --> 01:51:09,824
We were held for possibly books

2211
01:51:10,080 --> 01:51:10,592
We're just poor

2212
01:51:11,104 --> 01:51:17,248
Because they were poor they ended up because they applied for hospitalization

2213
01:51:17,504 --> 01:51:19,040
And then couldn't pay for it once they were

2214
01:51:19,296 --> 01:51:19,808
Fine

2215
01:51:20,320 --> 01:51:21,088
I find this past

2216
01:51:21,344 --> 01:51:22,624
It's particularly important to remember

2217
01:51:23,648 --> 01:51:29,024
Most were certified not with the load some more dangerous contagious

2218
01:51:29,792 --> 01:51:32,608
Capacity

2219
01:51:32,864 --> 01:51:33,888
Perform unskilled labor

2220
01:51:34,656 --> 01:51:40,800
Senility old-age varicose veins hernias poor vision and deformities of limbs or spine were among the primary

2221
01:51:41,056 --> 01:51:41,824
Causes for exclusion

2222
01:51:44,384 --> 01:51:47,456
It's so few of the more than 25 million arriving immigrants

2223
01:51:47,712 --> 01:51:50,016
Inspected by the p.m.

2224
01:51:50,272 --> 01:51:52,320
Were excluded setting to Baldwin

2225
01:51:52,832 --> 01:51:55,392
Countries almost insatiable industrial demand for

2226
01:51:55,648 --> 01:51:56,160
Cheap labor

2227
01:51:56,672 --> 01:52:02,560
Of course even though this was the case at Ellis Island wear a vast majority of people arriving were European it should be noted

2228
01:52:02,816 --> 01:52:03,840
The quote

2229
01:52:04,096 --> 01:52:07,424
Space more considerable medical obstacles to entry

2230
01:52:07,936 --> 01:52:10,496
Mexican border immigration

2231
01:52:12,032 --> 01:52:13,056
A Texas border station

2232
01:52:13,568 --> 01:52:15,616
Jessup

2233
01:52:15,872 --> 01:52:16,896
Shower disinfected

2234
01:52:17,152 --> 01:52:19,712
Search for lice large groups

2235
01:52:20,480 --> 01:52:23,552
All second and third class Asian immigrants arriving

2236
01:52:23,808 --> 01:52:26,368
Francisco endured physical exam

2237
01:52:26,624 --> 01:52:29,696
In addition to routine Laboratory Testing

2238
01:52:29,952 --> 01:52:30,976
A parasitic infection

2239
01:52:31,232 --> 01:52:34,304
Which required attention on Angel Island for water today

2240
01:52:35,072 --> 01:52:38,656
Health officials

2241
01:52:38,912 --> 01:52:40,192
Inscrutable Asian

2242
01:52:40,448 --> 01:52:41,728
Particularly the Chinese

2243
01:52:44,032 --> 01:52:45,056
Do you see a little bit of a

2244
01:52:45,312 --> 01:52:51,456
It's always a little bit of racism the real organ

2245
01:52:54,528 --> 01:52:56,320
You guys were not

2246
01:52:57,344 --> 01:52:57,856
Racist

2247
01:53:00,160 --> 01:53:02,720
But in such a ridiculously ignorant

2248
01:53:03,488 --> 01:53:04,000
Just like

2249
01:53:06,304 --> 01:53:07,328
4 million

2250
01:53:07,584 --> 01:53:08,608
No idea what that looks

2251
01:53:09,632 --> 01:53:11,168
You're sick or you're fine I don't know

2252
01:53:11,424 --> 01:53:13,472
My magical medical Vision can't read

2253
01:53:13,728 --> 01:53:14,752
Your agency

2254
01:53:15,008 --> 01:53:15,776
F***** up

2255
01:53:19,104 --> 01:53:19,872
24 things start

2256
01:53:20,896 --> 01:53:23,456
We set up a Visa system where American Consular Office

2257
01:53:25,504 --> 01:53:26,784
Before

2258
01:53:27,296 --> 01:53:28,576
This was specifically

2259
01:53:28,832 --> 01:53:30,112
Need to cut off the flow of immigrants

2260
01:53:30,368 --> 01:53:32,416
From undesirable Sutherland

2261
01:53:32,672 --> 01:53:33,440
Eastern European

2262
01:53:34,464 --> 01:53:37,024
Weird lay under the system between 1926

2263
01:53:37,536 --> 01:53:40,864
Almost 5% of immigrants

2264
01:53:41,120 --> 01:53:42,912
Where is during the days of Alice

2265
01:53:43,424 --> 01:53:47,520
The race has been around 1% turned away for medical reasons

2266
01:53:47,776 --> 01:53:48,544
Approximately 2

2267
01:53:48,800 --> 01:53:49,312
Percent turned away

2268
01:53:50,848 --> 01:53:53,152
The immigration system is always been a backbone

2269
01:53:55,200 --> 01:53:57,248
Medical rules of all

2270
01:53:57,504 --> 01:53:58,016
Exclusion

2271
01:53:58,272 --> 01:54:00,320
Before 24 of those who would

2272
01:54:00,576 --> 01:54:01,088
Be good cheap

2273
01:54:01,344 --> 01:54:04,672
And after 9224 of people

2274
01:54:08,256 --> 01:54:10,048
Concern for public health is Ludacris

2275
01:54:10,560 --> 01:54:14,400
He is merely a more overtly racist grandchild of this same

2276
01:54:15,680 --> 01:54:16,960
So that's my point about this

2277
01:54:19,264 --> 01:54:19,776
You think

2278
01:54:20,032 --> 01:54:23,104
All of these hard right guys right now if we didn't

2279
01:54:24,128 --> 01:54:24,896
System of automation

2280
01:54:25,664 --> 01:54:26,176
Would be like

2281
01:54:29,248 --> 01:54:30,784
Come on

2282
01:54:31,040 --> 01:54:32,064
We need you to do the factory

2283
01:54:34,624 --> 01:54:37,184
Totally different conversation

2284
01:54:37,696 --> 01:54:38,208
Cuz I need it

2285
01:54:39,232 --> 01:54:39,744
So

2286
01:54:40,512 --> 01:54:41,280
You may have forgotten

2287
01:54:41,536 --> 01:54:42,816
But we're talkin about

2288
01:54:43,072 --> 01:54:43,584
Train station

2289
01:54:45,120 --> 01:54:45,632
Sure we are.

2290
01:54:46,144 --> 01:54:48,192
So

2291
01:54:48,448 --> 01:54:48,960
Train station in

2292
01:54:49,216 --> 01:54:51,776
I think we are Alex's specifically

2293
01:54:54,848 --> 01:54:55,616
She's trying to apply it

2294
01:54:55,872 --> 01:54:56,384
2

2295
01:54:56,640 --> 01:54:58,432
His negatives about immigrants

2296
01:55:06,368 --> 01:55:07,392
Safeway

2297
01:55:07,648 --> 01:55:10,208
And then prayer

2298
01:55:12,512 --> 01:55:13,536
I agree

2299
01:55:13,792 --> 01:55:15,840
Getting the sense

2300
01:55:16,096 --> 01:55:16,608
This is why

2301
01:55:17,632 --> 01:55:18,656
I could only cover

2302
01:55:22,496 --> 01:55:23,520
We wanted

2303
01:55:24,032 --> 01:55:25,312
You start the episode Alex's

2304
01:55:25,568 --> 01:55:27,104
Depressed and then he starts yelling about

2305
01:55:27,360 --> 01:55:33,504
Before you know it

2306
01:55:34,528 --> 01:55:35,808
Pages and pages about

2307
01:55:36,064 --> 01:55:36,576
Belgium

2308
01:55:37,088 --> 01:55:38,368
Political parties

2309
01:55:39,136 --> 01:55:40,416
And here we are

2310
01:55:40,928 --> 01:55:42,976
Alignment brings up a new story

2311
01:55:43,232 --> 01:55:44,768
About this at Garden Nord

2312
01:55:50,400 --> 01:55:53,472
Just publish that story

2313
01:55:53,728 --> 01:55:58,848
For a variety of different

2314
01:55:59,104 --> 01:56:01,408
Diseases including a variety of hepatitis

2315
01:56:01,664 --> 01:56:02,944
Strains and so

2316
01:56:03,200 --> 01:56:09,344
They're also damn playing this one insane

2317
01:56:09,856 --> 01:56:16,000
But I think that this ties into the larger situation we had this measles outbreak that's just explode

2318
01:56:18,560 --> 01:56:22,912
Just believe

2319
01:56:23,424 --> 01:56:26,240
Do that can't you just do that

2320
01:56:26,496 --> 01:56:30,848
Oh that's very smart

2321
01:56:35,456 --> 01:56:35,968
I'm covering this

2322
01:56:36,480 --> 01:56:36,992
Crystal

2323
01:56:41,600 --> 01:56:42,112
Listen to USB

2324
01:56:43,904 --> 01:56:45,952
It's very clear that this is only in service

2325
01:56:46,208 --> 01:56:47,232
Upholstery

2326
01:56:47,488 --> 01:56:52,608
Look the belgians are doing that we should get rid of him to this is what the story is about to these people

2327
01:56:52,864 --> 01:56:53,888
Like Alex and Dad

2328
01:56:54,400 --> 01:56:54,912
Suck the beat

2329
01:56:55,424 --> 01:56:55,936
Goddamn

2330
01:56:57,216 --> 01:57:00,288
Is using as a source

2331
01:57:00,800 --> 01:57:02,848
It doesn't involve local officials

2332
01:57:03,616 --> 01:57:04,896
Involves news organization

2333
01:57:05,152 --> 01:57:08,736
Current public health organizations that are on the ground actually know the fact

2334
01:57:10,016 --> 01:57:11,296
The meat of the matter

2335
01:57:13,088 --> 01:57:16,160
Nation among personnel

2336
01:57:16,672 --> 01:57:19,232
That's playing reporting of the

2337
01:57:19,488 --> 01:57:20,000
The fact

2338
01:57:20,256 --> 01:57:21,792
Is he trying to insinuate

2339
01:57:23,328 --> 01:57:29,472
Stop snowing

2340
01:57:29,728 --> 01:57:32,544
It's just the default position of

2341
01:57:33,568 --> 01:57:34,848
It doesn't fit the narrative must

2342
01:57:35,104 --> 01:57:36,128
Secretly be a cover-up

2343
01:57:36,896 --> 01:57:38,688
His mentality is incredibly dangerous

2344
01:57:42,272 --> 01:57:43,296
Dehumanization narrative

2345
01:57:43,552 --> 01:57:44,064
Because it's

2346
01:57:44,320 --> 01:57:45,088
Based on nothing

2347
01:57:45,600 --> 01:57:46,112
Idiot

2348
01:57:50,208 --> 01:57:50,720
Thursday

2349
01:57:51,744 --> 01:57:52,512
Completely misrepresented

2350
01:57:52,768 --> 01:57:53,280
Primary source

2351
01:57:53,792 --> 01:57:54,304
Espresso X

2352
01:57:55,328 --> 01:58:00,704
If you read it it clearly says around 10 workers are concerned and will be vaccinated against hepatitis A and B

2353
01:58:01,472 --> 01:58:05,824
It's just a few and got together and they were like

2354
01:58:06,336 --> 01:58:07,104
Smart

2355
01:58:07,360 --> 01:58:13,504
If your God I hate everybody

2356
01:58:14,784 --> 01:58:16,320
The French paper at a belt

2357
01:58:16,576 --> 01:58:18,624
Where you learned that around

2358
01:58:18,880 --> 01:58:23,232
12

2359
01:58:27,840 --> 01:58:29,632
It could be a risk to clean and cruise

2360
01:58:29,888 --> 01:58:36,032
Call my God I hate everyone important to point out

2361
01:58:36,288 --> 01:58:37,824
Scott is at the hole that isn't getting

2362
01:58:38,080 --> 01:58:38,592
Vaccine

2363
01:58:38,848 --> 01:58:41,664
It's done 512 employees request

2364
01:58:42,176 --> 01:58:42,688
To themselves

2365
01:58:43,712 --> 01:58:44,736
This is crucially important

2366
01:58:44,992 --> 01:58:45,760
I am rooting for

2367
01:58:47,040 --> 01:58:48,064
This is crucially important

2368
01:58:48,576 --> 01:58:49,088
These people

2369
01:58:49,600 --> 01:58:50,624
Alex and Lyman

2370
01:58:51,136 --> 01:58:52,928
These people like them to propaganda

2371
01:58:53,696 --> 01:58:56,000
Cherry-pick their information in an abusive fashion

2372
01:58:56,512 --> 01:58:57,536
Because they are not journalists

2373
01:58:59,584 --> 01:59:01,632
Whose current primary objective is implanted

2374
01:59:01,888 --> 01:59:06,496
Solidifying their audiences mine the people who are from where from where you are

2375
01:59:06,752 --> 01:59:08,032
From should be suspected

2376
01:59:08,288 --> 01:59:10,080
Being transmitters of infectious disease

2377
01:59:10,848 --> 01:59:12,384
They're basically biological

2378
01:59:12,640 --> 01:59:16,224
Used by the Democrats you want them to get in

2379
01:59:17,504 --> 01:59:18,272
Is repulsive stuff

2380
01:59:18,784 --> 01:59:20,320
Engaged

2381
01:59:20,576 --> 01:59:21,088
Kind of talk

2382
01:59:21,344 --> 01:59:22,112
So flippantly

2383
01:59:22,624 --> 01:59:23,904
Is legitimately terrifying

2384
01:59:24,416 --> 01:59:26,720
Yes how do they not understand that this is

2385
01:59:26,976 --> 01:59:29,792
I don't I don't understand

2386
01:59:30,560 --> 01:59:31,584
So much like

2387
01:59:33,376 --> 01:59:34,912
Creation of the border between

2388
01:59:36,704 --> 01:59:37,472
Where is almost like

2389
01:59:38,496 --> 01:59:39,520
This propaganda

2390
01:59:39,776 --> 01:59:40,800
Just built up and then

2391
01:59:41,056 --> 01:59:41,824
Overnight

2392
01:59:42,336 --> 01:59:43,872
Your neighbor now became

2393
01:59:44,384 --> 01:59:45,152
Your

2394
01:59:45,664 --> 01:59:46,176
You know just like

2395
01:59:46,432 --> 01:59:47,968
The next day you're like a

2396
01:59:51,296 --> 01:59:52,064
Just not even

2397
01:59:52,320 --> 01:59:54,112
Not even realizing that you're

2398
01:59:54,368 --> 01:59:54,880
One step away from

2399
01:59:55,136 --> 01:59:56,672
It would be like

2400
01:59:56,928 --> 01:59:59,488
Eradication

2401
02:00:00,768 --> 02:00:02,816
Describe

2402
02:00:04,096 --> 02:00:06,400
Some more about

2403
02:00:07,680 --> 02:00:08,704
Just trying to make you afraid of him

2404
02:00:09,472 --> 02:00:09,984
Because that's the game

2405
02:00:14,848 --> 02:00:15,360
Anime

2406
02:00:15,616 --> 02:00:16,128
Immediately

2407
02:00:17,920 --> 02:00:19,456
Trying to prove that they don't exist

2408
02:00:19,968 --> 02:00:20,480
Accidentally

2409
02:00:20,992 --> 02:00:25,344
Cheyenne no go zones everywhere

2410
02:00:25,600 --> 02:00:27,648
Ozoner

2411
02:00:28,672 --> 02:00:30,976
Yeah I've been in them myself

2412
02:00:34,304 --> 02:00:36,096
Logos

2413
02:00:36,608 --> 02:00:38,656
Exactly

2414
02:00:47,104 --> 02:00:50,688
Nothing

2415
02:00:50,944 --> 02:00:53,760
Here's a little bit of a

2416
02:00:54,016 --> 02:00:55,296
It was a it was a Denny's

2417
02:00:55,552 --> 02:00:57,088
Is little conversation

2418
02:00:57,600 --> 02:00:58,112
About

2419
02:00:58,368 --> 02:00:59,136
No go Zone

2420
02:01:01,952 --> 02:01:08,096
Just to give that people in a tidy I mean

2421
02:01:08,352 --> 02:01:08,864
How to go into them

2422
02:01:15,520 --> 02:01:20,128
The police are up going in Paris

2423
02:01:20,384 --> 02:01:26,528
I've been in that minute

2424
02:01:26,784 --> 02:01:28,320
Send

2425
02:01:28,576 --> 02:01:34,720
Darius where the police won't go where they're afraid to go or they're just in frayed afraid to enforce the law

2426
02:01:34,976 --> 02:01:38,048
At this point there are areas of places like Portland Oregon

2427
02:01:38,304 --> 02:01:39,584
Which are also becoming

2428
02:01:43,424 --> 02:01:46,496
Who are I just basically they're running the show there

2429
02:01:46,752 --> 02:01:52,896
For making religion

2430
02:01:53,152 --> 02:01:53,664
Say that

2431
02:01:58,016 --> 02:01:59,040
The idea of

2432
02:01:59,296 --> 02:02:00,576
Portland

2433
02:02:01,856 --> 02:02:03,392
If you look into the

2434
02:02:03,904 --> 02:02:04,416
Situation

2435
02:02:05,440 --> 02:02:10,304
Just go do some Northwest has a long and wonderful history of being

2436
02:02:10,816 --> 02:02:13,376
It's a problem

2437
02:02:15,168 --> 02:02:15,680
Too big for now

2438
02:02:18,752 --> 02:02:21,312
Vincent van Gogh

2439
02:02:21,568 --> 02:02:25,408
Play Define what it mean

2440
02:02:30,016 --> 02:02:31,040
Just vague enough

2441
02:02:31,296 --> 02:02:33,600
Terms

2442
02:02:34,624 --> 02:02:35,136
Really

2443
02:02:35,392 --> 02:02:36,160
Interested in going

2444
02:02:39,744 --> 02:02:40,512
FIFA which suggests

2445
02:02:40,768 --> 02:02:41,536
If there is still alive

2446
02:02:41,792 --> 02:02:42,560
Edited still being

2447
02:02:45,632 --> 02:02:47,168
Skiers don't talk about it

2448
02:02:48,704 --> 02:02:50,496
This is one of the first time

2449
02:02:51,008 --> 02:02:51,776
The first time

2450
02:02:52,288 --> 02:02:53,824
Alex's show

2451
02:02:54,336 --> 02:02:54,848
Perhaps

2452
02:02:57,664 --> 02:03:00,992
Antifa area

2453
02:03:07,904 --> 02:03:14,048
They operate under Sharia law Muslims aren't welcome at all because the Muslims

2454
02:03:14,304 --> 02:03:16,608
More powerful

2455
02:03:17,888 --> 02:03:21,728
In reality what these f****** a****** right-wing piles of s*** or describing

2456
02:03:21,984 --> 02:03:25,824
Is predominantly minority neighborhoods where they feel uncomfortable

2457
02:03:26,080 --> 02:03:32,224
No it's a no-go zones telling me that I can't go there

2458
02:03:32,480 --> 02:03:33,504
I feel like I'm

2459
02:03:33,760 --> 02:03:35,296
Subdominant

2460
02:03:35,552 --> 02:03:37,344
You'll notice the damn Lyman is not being so

2461
02:03:37,600 --> 02:03:40,416
Specific about these areas he's been through it all

2462
02:03:42,720 --> 02:03:44,000
This is very intentional

2463
02:03:44,256 --> 02:03:48,352
Because the West Pacific you are the more

2464
02:03:48,864 --> 02:03:50,144
If you take away

2465
02:03:51,680 --> 02:03:55,264
Specificity your nailed to the wall whenever seems like you're f****** full of s***

2466
02:03:56,288 --> 02:03:59,360
Paris

2467
02:03:59,616 --> 02:04:03,200
Mini documentaries on YouTube that I found where she set out to do to invest

2468
02:04:03,968 --> 02:04:06,016
Checking out all the alleged Muslim no-go zones

2469
02:04:06,272 --> 02:04:07,552
Along with her camera

2470
02:04:08,064 --> 02:04:09,088
Specifically pointing out that

2471
02:04:09,344 --> 02:04:15,488
She's a woman alone

2472
02:04:21,376 --> 02:04:22,144
Watch eyes

2473
02:04:22,656 --> 02:04:23,680
Bad

2474
02:04:23,936 --> 02:04:28,032
Yeah that's not a neighborhood everywhere that meant

2475
02:04:28,288 --> 02:04:34,432
In Muslim

2476
02:04:34,688 --> 02:04:35,968
Neighborhoods where Sharia law wasn't

2477
02:04:36,480 --> 02:04:36,992
I don't

2478
02:04:41,600 --> 02:04:42,368
Pretty well-documented

2479
02:04:45,440 --> 02:04:45,952
Has about

2480
02:04:46,208 --> 02:04:47,232
1300

2481
02:04:48,256 --> 02:04:51,840
Paul Joseph Watson definitely not a Nazi but seems to hang out with

2482
02:04:52,096 --> 02:04:53,376
Quite a bit

2483
02:04:53,632 --> 02:04:54,400
$2,000

2484
02:04:54,656 --> 02:04:57,728
To go explore the alleged no go zones in Malmo

2485
02:04:58,240 --> 02:05:01,312
And even he had to admit that he

2486
02:05:01,568 --> 02:05:03,616
Even in the areas that everyone said was the worst

2487
02:05:04,128 --> 02:05:05,152
That hasn't stopped

2488
02:05:05,408 --> 02:05:08,480
He's documentary as being used as evidence of

2489
02:05:08,992 --> 02:05:10,784
And it has 2.1 million views on you

2490
02:05:11,552 --> 02:05:12,832
China Sea

2491
02:05:14,624 --> 02:05:19,232
CID has been flying around for quite a while but I've talked to them as really ramped up some

2492
02:05:19,488 --> 02:05:20,256
Since 2015

2493
02:05:20,512 --> 02:05:23,328
Because that's what about a million refugees

2494
02:05:23,584 --> 02:05:25,120
Mostly from Syria at the

2495
02:05:26,400 --> 02:05:27,936
I can't be any more explicit than

2496
02:05:28,704 --> 02:05:31,264
These people who push these narratives are not doing it

2497
02:05:31,520 --> 02:05:33,312
Because they're concerned about and imagined ink

2498
02:05:33,824 --> 02:05:36,128
Whatever high-minded reason

2499
02:05:36,896 --> 02:05:39,968
Prince Temple the idea of no go zones exist is

2500
02:05:40,224 --> 02:05:41,504
Preemptive conditioning

2501
02:05:41,760 --> 02:05:45,856
To desensitize people against the idea of violence against minority neighborhood

2502
02:05:46,624 --> 02:05:49,696
It's a rationalization for looking the other way if

2503
02:05:49,952 --> 02:05:56,096
Police Crackdown on of course they had to send the National Guard

2504
02:05:56,352 --> 02:05:58,912
Regular police just couldn't with a hundred

2505
02:06:01,472 --> 02:06:02,240
It turns out that

2506
02:06:02,496 --> 02:06:04,032
Really we just need to send in a few

2507
02:06:04,288 --> 02:06:05,824
Few special ops people

2508
02:06:06,848 --> 02:06:07,872
Military guys

2509
02:06:08,128 --> 02:06:09,920
Maybe maybe send a

2510
02:06:11,456 --> 02:06:12,480
23rd

2511
02:06:12,736 --> 02:06:16,064
Hundred this is the implication behind no-go Zone propagate

2512
02:06:16,576 --> 02:06:19,648
We're going to have to suck it up and send the military

2513
02:06:22,464 --> 02:06:26,304
Is it deeply Insidious narrative Matt only to further stigmatize immigrant

2514
02:06:26,560 --> 02:06:30,144
And make sure that there is no chance

2515
02:06:30,656 --> 02:06:33,728
Integration

2516
02:06:34,752 --> 02:06:35,264
And here's the thing

2517
02:06:35,776 --> 02:06:37,056
In order to reinforce these

2518
02:06:37,824 --> 02:06:39,104
Motherfukers who pushed this

2519
02:06:41,664 --> 02:06:42,944
When Temple went to Sweden

2520
02:06:43,200 --> 02:06:44,480
Any footage of any

2521
02:06:44,992 --> 02:06:48,832
To make it look like a trip wasn't a total waste of time for right-wing.

2522
02:06:49,088 --> 02:06:49,856
He claims It quotes

2523
02:06:50,112 --> 02:06:52,416
Several men started masking up and following

2524
02:06:52,928 --> 02:06:56,256
To leave and had to escort us to our car

2525
02:06:56,512 --> 02:06:58,304
This is when he was in freaking be

2526
02:06:58,560 --> 02:06:59,840
Which is just outside Stockholm

2527
02:07:00,608 --> 02:07:06,752
He went on to later say quote they got in their car to escort us out and we had to walk alongside their vehicle and followed us to

2528
02:07:07,008 --> 02:07:07,520
Our car

2529
02:07:07,776 --> 02:07:10,080
As we're walking there were people just following

2530
02:07:10,336 --> 02:07:10,848
Just yelling thing

2531
02:07:11,360 --> 02:07:14,176
You suck you racist piece of s***

2532
02:07:14,432 --> 02:07:15,968
F*** you

2533
02:07:16,224 --> 02:07:19,040
Good story in your mouth

2534
02:07:19,296 --> 02:07:21,344
These stories of no-go zones are true

2535
02:07:21,600 --> 02:07:22,112
And maybe

2536
02:07:22,368 --> 02:07:23,648
It's just a reality a little bit

2537
02:07:24,928 --> 02:07:25,696
Kristen Tim pool

2538
02:07:25,952 --> 02:07:26,720
The skills to dick

2539
02:07:27,232 --> 02:07:29,536
It's precisely the sort of thing that someone

2540
02:07:29,792 --> 02:07:30,560
Nothing

2541
02:07:30,816 --> 02:07:32,096
Sports

2542
02:07:32,352 --> 02:07:35,936
Might be inclined to lie about in order to make sure that the documentary that he makes

2543
02:07:36,448 --> 02:07:38,752
Still work to reinforce no go Zone narrative

2544
02:07:39,008 --> 02:07:41,568
It's important performing any kind of science

2545
02:07:42,080 --> 02:07:43,104
Experimental or invest

2546
02:07:43,872 --> 02:07:45,152
To figure out what out

2547
02:07:45,664 --> 02:07:46,944
You want to have first

2548
02:07:47,968 --> 02:07:48,736
And then

2549
02:07:49,248 --> 02:07:50,016
Get yourself to that

2550
02:07:50,272 --> 02:07:51,040
Concluded

2551
02:07:51,552 --> 02:07:56,160
Whatever reality

2552
02:07:56,416 --> 02:08:01,024
You don't want the Koch brothers to tell you that your climates

2553
02:08:01,536 --> 02:08:03,072
So I'm suggesting

2554
02:08:05,632 --> 02:08:06,912
Look like a maybe there is something

2555
02:08:07,168 --> 02:08:09,472
But let me guess a question

2556
02:08:09,728 --> 02:08:10,240
Do you know who else

2557
02:08:10,752 --> 02:08:11,264
B b c

2558
02:08:11,776 --> 02:08:14,592
Pitbull

2559
02:08:17,408 --> 02:08:20,736
When the local Swedish news Outlet contacted the police

2560
02:08:20,992 --> 02:08:24,064
A press officer said that did not receive

2561
02:08:24,832 --> 02:08:26,624
Frida Nordhoff North law

2562
02:08:28,672 --> 02:08:32,512
When it started filming a group of young people

2563
02:08:33,792 --> 02:08:35,328
And shouted at him to stop filming

2564
02:08:35,840 --> 02:08:39,936
The officers in the middle of the square

2565
02:08:40,192 --> 02:08:40,704
Keep filming

2566
02:08:41,216 --> 02:08:42,240
Completely misrepresented

2567
02:08:43,776 --> 02:08:45,312
Being followed

2568
02:08:45,568 --> 02:08:46,592
Somehow

2569
02:08:47,872 --> 02:08:48,384
F****** b*******

2570
02:08:50,944 --> 02:08:52,480
Could you could you quit being an a******

2571
02:08:52,736 --> 02:08:53,504
Alright

2572
02:08:53,760 --> 02:08:59,648
Literally no evidence involved

2573
02:08:59,904 --> 02:09:01,696
Or things that could just be seeing his

2574
02:09:01,952 --> 02:09:03,488
The normal sort of thing

2575
02:09:04,000 --> 02:09:06,304
Some parts of cities have higher crime than other parts of the city

2576
02:09:06,560 --> 02:09:12,192
Had a lot of that could be explained really easily by economic realities that don't really have anything to do with Islam or immigration

2577
02:09:12,704 --> 02:09:16,032
Keep on pushing your narratives

2578
02:09:16,544 --> 02:09:17,568
That's cool

2579
02:09:19,616 --> 02:09:20,384
So This Is the End

2580
02:09:20,640 --> 02:09:21,152
The damn lineman

2581
02:09:21,920 --> 02:09:24,736
Play My Life

2582
02:09:26,784 --> 02:09:27,808
Alex let them go

2583
02:09:28,320 --> 02:09:29,344
They've done what they need to do

2584
02:09:29,600 --> 02:09:30,368
Alex wants

2585
02:09:30,624 --> 02:09:32,160
To talk about his personal aggrievement

2586
02:09:32,672 --> 02:09:34,720
And how

2587
02:09:35,488 --> 02:09:37,024
Compare themselves

2588
02:09:38,048 --> 02:09:39,072
This is an unfair cover

2589
02:09:46,752 --> 02:09:50,080
About 1,000 articles

2590
02:09:50,592 --> 02:09:52,896
A conservative judge

2591
02:09:56,224 --> 02:09:57,760
Have no respect

2592
02:09:58,016 --> 02:09:59,808
Collage

2593
02:10:03,648 --> 02:10:06,720
Kicks you off your butt

2594
02:10:07,232 --> 02:10:12,864
You get treated like you're a juvenile that's a good

2595
02:10:13,120 --> 02:10:15,168
I hate you so much

2596
02:10:15,424 --> 02:10:17,216
That's pretty crazy

2597
02:10:20,032 --> 02:10:24,640
On days like this

2598
02:10:24,896 --> 02:10:30,528
Really tossed your that kind of comparison

2599
02:10:30,784 --> 02:10:32,064
Like it's real brash

2600
02:10:33,856 --> 02:10:35,648
I guess I just found that out by saying no

2601
02:10:35,904 --> 02:10:38,208
You're more like an is

2602
02:10:39,744 --> 02:10:40,512
Supports Netanyahu

2603
02:10:42,560 --> 02:10:43,840
After his self agreement

2604
02:10:44,096 --> 02:10:46,144
Complaining

2605
02:10:47,424 --> 02:10:47,936
Holocaust

2606
02:10:48,192 --> 02:10:49,216
Alex gets to

2607
02:10:52,544 --> 02:10:56,128
Claimed was his main story which is the

2608
02:10:56,640 --> 02:10:57,664
The Facebook sensors

2609
02:10:57,920 --> 02:10:59,968
Who are coming down with

2610
02:11:00,480 --> 02:11:02,016
Chair

2611
02:11:02,272 --> 02:11:03,040
To spending it as

2612
02:11:04,320 --> 02:11:05,344
Sjw snowflake

2613
02:11:05,600 --> 02:11:07,904
Globalist

2614
02:11:08,160 --> 02:11:10,464
What students because if they watches

2615
02:11:11,488 --> 02:11:17,632
And show years ago I began computer

2616
02:11:17,888 --> 02:11:19,424
Which more more they're doing

2617
02:11:19,936 --> 02:11:23,520
Humans that have to listen to shows

2618
02:11:24,032 --> 02:11:27,872
Add Facebook and Twitter in Google in PlayStation

2619
02:11:28,640 --> 02:11:30,944
Well they get radicalized

2620
02:11:33,504 --> 02:11:35,296
We have the Shay

2621
02:11:36,320 --> 02:11:38,112
Versus what mainstream media

2622
02:11:42,720 --> 02:11:43,744
Is saying about us

2623
02:11:44,256 --> 02:11:45,792
So you can see that this is just trying to

2624
02:11:46,560 --> 02:11:48,352
A little bit this is

2625
02:11:50,144 --> 02:11:50,912
People are starting to

2626
02:11:51,168 --> 02:11:53,472
To find a mental health problem

2627
02:11:53,728 --> 02:11:57,568
Listening to you interpret that

2628
02:11:58,080 --> 02:11:59,360
Listening to me

2629
02:12:00,640 --> 02:12:01,920
That's not healthy

2630
02:12:02,176 --> 02:12:03,456
That's really

2631
02:12:03,712 --> 02:12:06,784
F***** up the actual article in the verge

2632
02:12:08,064 --> 02:12:10,368
It's very hard to come away from that article without

2633
02:12:10,880 --> 02:12:11,904
Decent amount of apathy

2634
02:12:12,160 --> 02:12:13,952
And concern for the people who

2635
02:12:14,208 --> 02:12:15,232
Have to make

2636
02:12:15,488 --> 02:12:17,280
Social media spaces livable for us

2637
02:12:22,144 --> 02:12:22,912
Take on it

2638
02:12:23,424 --> 02:12:23,936
So

2639
02:12:24,448 --> 02:12:24,960
Indeed

2640
02:12:25,728 --> 02:12:26,496
Wicked

2641
02:12:29,312 --> 02:12:32,896
Yeah I'm self into the most

2642
02:12:33,152 --> 02:12:34,944
Powerful man you could ever

2643
02:12:35,456 --> 02:12:36,992
Because

2644
02:12:37,504 --> 02:12:40,832
They can watch Fox News all day on their own

2645
02:12:42,112 --> 02:12:43,904
Wednesday watch even a little

2646
02:12:44,160 --> 02:12:48,512
Clip of my show their radicalized

2647
02:12:48,768 --> 02:12:49,792
Imagine

2648
02:12:50,048 --> 02:12:53,888
These people watch like half-hour videos

2649
02:12:54,144 --> 02:12:59,264
Three 400 things a day

2650
02:12:59,776 --> 02:13:01,824
Open Infowars logo they like to get it out of

2651
02:13:02,080 --> 02:13:03,616
Probably more about

2652
02:13:03,872 --> 02:13:04,384
Memes

2653
02:13:04,640 --> 02:13:05,408
And stuff like that

2654
02:13:06,688 --> 02:13:08,224
I convey appointment quicker

2655
02:13:08,480 --> 02:13:10,016
Yeah

2656
02:13:10,272 --> 02:13:11,040
Appealingly to

2657
02:13:12,320 --> 02:13:12,832
Yeah

2658
02:13:13,088 --> 02:13:15,648
But anyway

2659
02:13:15,904 --> 02:13:16,416
Insidesource

2660
02:13:17,184 --> 02:13:18,720
In Facebook moderation

2661
02:13:24,864 --> 02:13:25,632
Seems weird

2662
02:13:25,888 --> 02:13:27,168
I don't believe them

2663
02:13:27,424 --> 02:13:28,704
But also he just gets real gross

2664
02:13:29,216 --> 02:13:29,728
Crew at the end

2665
02:13:30,240 --> 02:13:32,800
CBS put out a report

2666
02:13:33,312 --> 02:13:34,080
Chicago

2667
02:13:36,384 --> 02:13:39,200
Multifaceted

2668
02:13:40,480 --> 02:13:43,296
Snuff films

2669
02:13:50,976 --> 02:13:56,864
You see the articles about Facebook employees at the moderate conspiracy

2670
02:13:59,680 --> 02:14:02,240
Talk about why

2671
02:14:02,496 --> 02:14:04,800
Watch what they're doing

2672
02:14:08,128 --> 02:14:09,152
They spy on them

2673
02:14:14,784 --> 02:14:16,832
Sometimes

2674
02:14:17,600 --> 02:14:21,696
Because you know if you decide hey we shouldn't be

2675
02:14:28,352 --> 02:14:29,888
Highest turnover

2676
02:14:30,144 --> 02:14:33,216
That's the group that got a Target that's a group say that a watch

2677
02:14:36,288 --> 02:14:36,800
Is it

2678
02:14:39,104 --> 02:14:43,456
Moderation

2679
02:14:46,528 --> 02:14:50,112
College

2680
02:14:51,136 --> 02:14:52,160
And then

2681
02:14:52,672 --> 02:14:57,792
They get into my document last year

2682
02:14:58,560 --> 02:15:01,632
So now he read an article the moderators themselves

2683
02:15:01,888 --> 02:15:03,936
Our compatriots

2684
02:15:04,192 --> 02:15:04,704
Because of their

2685
02:15:04,960 --> 02:15:05,472
Experience

2686
02:15:05,728 --> 02:15:06,752
Weekend

2687
02:15:07,008 --> 02:15:07,776
True

2688
02:15:08,032 --> 02:15:09,056
He's referencing an article

2689
02:15:09,568 --> 02:15:13,664
Like a year ago

2690
02:15:13,920 --> 02:15:16,992
Publicly available information

2691
02:15:19,040 --> 02:15:20,064
To some sort of a

2692
02:15:20,320 --> 02:15:23,136
A noble Crusade that these people were being

2693
02:15:25,696 --> 02:15:26,720
Are are engaged

2694
02:15:27,488 --> 02:15:29,024
Not there people who are hurting

2695
02:15:30,816 --> 02:15:34,144
And so I don't know

2696
02:15:36,192 --> 02:15:36,704
Sexual

2697
02:15:37,216 --> 02:15:39,520
The child molestation

2698
02:15:40,032 --> 02:15:41,568
And then later on he says

2699
02:15:41,824 --> 02:15:42,336
They're getting teeth

2700
02:15:42,848 --> 02:15:43,360
Messi from

2701
02:15:46,944 --> 02:15:47,968
So he's

2702
02:15:48,224 --> 02:15:49,504
They're brainwashed to think

2703
02:15:49,760 --> 02:15:50,272
That the child molester

2704
02:15:51,040 --> 02:15:51,808
It's totally fine

2705
02:15:52,320 --> 02:15:58,464
It's only well maybe College

2706
02:15:58,720 --> 02:16:01,536
I don't know I mean the broader point

2707
02:16:01,792 --> 02:16:02,560
He's trying to make

2708
02:16:02,816 --> 02:16:03,328
Candlelight

2709
02:16:03,584 --> 02:16:06,400
Really understand a lot of

2710
02:16:06,656 --> 02:16:08,192
The finer details

2711
02:16:11,008 --> 02:16:11,520
Batman

2712
02:16:13,824 --> 02:16:18,176
I only play some of that stuff again

2713
02:16:18,432 --> 02:16:23,552
I don't really care I think we talked about it enough at the beginning that because it leads

2714
02:16:24,064 --> 02:16:29,440
What good birthday present

2715
02:16:29,696 --> 02:16:34,816
No support our

2716
02:16:35,072 --> 02:16:35,584
Alex

2717
02:16:36,096 --> 02:16:36,608
Loses

2718
02:16:37,120 --> 02:16:37,632
Okay

2719
02:16:38,144 --> 02:16:39,424
And you know what he loses it about

2720
02:16:40,448 --> 02:16:41,984
He's trying to cover the story

2721
02:16:42,496 --> 02:16:45,056
If you want on screen for the

2722
02:16:45,312 --> 02:16:45,824
Thesaurus

2723
02:16:46,336 --> 02:16:48,640
Of the article referencing

2724
02:16:48,896 --> 02:16:50,432
He wanted to be an Infowars

2725
02:16:51,200 --> 02:16:52,736
But it's a different sites article

2726
02:16:52,992 --> 02:16:54,272
And this pisses him off

2727
02:16:54,784 --> 02:16:55,552
To no end

2728
02:16:56,064 --> 02:17:01,184
And because he ends up storming off the set of

2729
02:17:01,440 --> 02:17:06,048
Facebook calls me dangerous imagine my shock no really

2730
02:17:08,608 --> 02:17:10,400
Infowars

2731
02:17:10,656 --> 02:17:14,240
Dot-com

2732
02:17:19,872 --> 02:17:24,224
Just go to the old infowars.com

2733
02:17:29,344 --> 02:17:30,880
Can I move to Canada

2734
02:17:33,184 --> 02:17:39,328
Like I want you

2735
02:17:47,520 --> 02:17:50,592
I heard him leave the studio

2736
02:17:50,848 --> 02:17:52,896
Gruffly that I can hear footsteps

2737
02:17:53,408 --> 02:17:59,552
But you can hear it wasn't video I be like that's total

2738
02:18:01,600 --> 02:18:04,928
Clump clump

2739
02:18:05,440 --> 02:18:11,584
Jesus so what happened a lot more build-up for him to just walked out the show that's like

2740
02:18:13,376 --> 02:18:14,656
I can actually I can explain

2741
02:18:15,936 --> 02:18:18,240
My very strong

2742
02:18:18,496 --> 02:18:20,544
Alright happened is

2743
02:18:20,800 --> 02:18:22,848
He's covering this Facebook story and I have pulled up

2744
02:18:23,104 --> 02:18:24,128
An article for Cuban events

2745
02:18:24,640 --> 02:18:29,760
Which is where is involved in erotic

2746
02:18:32,064 --> 02:18:33,344
Maybe so

2747
02:18:33,856 --> 02:18:35,392
Article

2748
02:18:35,904 --> 02:18:42,048
I'll pull it up on my phone I'll pull up article

2749
02:18:43,584 --> 02:18:44,352
To cover the story

2750
02:18:44,608 --> 02:18:49,728
Realizes

2751
02:18:51,008 --> 02:18:52,032
Or maybe

2752
02:18:52,288 --> 02:18:55,360
It's like I was going to take longer more dead air than I want there to be

2753
02:18:55,872 --> 02:18:57,152
I'm going off air

2754
02:18:57,408 --> 02:19:00,480
To find the article doesn't know what the article

2755
02:19:00,736 --> 02:19:02,784
Doesn't know how to search for it

2756
02:19:03,296 --> 02:19:03,808
Maybe

2757
02:19:05,088 --> 02:19:09,184
The reason that he storms off and the reason that if the build-up is so short

2758
02:19:10,720 --> 02:19:13,024
Is it

2759
02:19:13,280 --> 02:19:13,792
Chance

2760
02:19:14,048 --> 02:19:15,072
Is driving traffic

2761
02:19:15,328 --> 02:19:16,608
Aggressively

2762
02:19:17,120 --> 02:19:18,400
Hey the only place

2763
02:19:18,656 --> 02:19:19,680
But he has control over

2764
02:19:20,192 --> 02:19:22,240
IP address

2765
02:19:25,312 --> 02:19:25,824
State

2766
02:19:26,080 --> 02:19:26,848
Where is Aldi

2767
02:19:27,104 --> 02:19:28,128
These other platforms

2768
02:19:28,384 --> 02:19:29,408
Clearly go away

2769
02:19:29,664 --> 02:19:34,528
Yeah I know YouTube's kick them off now Facebook Instagram he's gone the only thing

2770
02:19:34,784 --> 02:19:35,296
He can really

2771
02:19:35,552 --> 02:19:36,320
Controlled

2772
02:19:36,576 --> 02:19:37,344
Flow 2

2773
02:19:37,600 --> 02:19:38,112
And what

2774
02:19:38,368 --> 02:19:40,160
You do with the flow 2

2775
02:19:40,416 --> 02:19:41,952
Monetizing the amount of traffic

2776
02:19:43,232 --> 02:19:47,328
Call he's got

2777
02:19:47,584 --> 02:19:50,144
Steven B like human events

2778
02:19:50,400 --> 02:19:55,264
The ideological he has an interesting by virtue of his lawyer

2779
02:19:55,776 --> 02:19:56,544
Being involved in it

2780
02:19:56,800 --> 02:20:02,944
He doesn't want to drive traffic to them because that is a zero-sum game

2781
02:20:03,200 --> 02:20:04,736
That article isn't going to him

2782
02:20:04,992 --> 02:20:06,272
Covering the same story

2783
02:20:06,528 --> 02:20:07,552
So he knows

2784
02:20:07,808 --> 02:20:10,112
It is really mad at his staff

2785
02:20:10,368 --> 02:20:15,232
For doing that you could always be an Infowars article that is always.

2786
02:20:15,488 --> 02:20:18,304
And I think that's what facilitated his freak out

2787
02:20:18,560 --> 02:20:19,328
And

2788
02:20:19,840 --> 02:20:22,400
I know about him

2789
02:20:22,912 --> 02:20:24,192
Especially the current

2790
02:20:24,704 --> 02:20:27,520
Please be like that's the only conclusion

2791
02:20:28,544 --> 02:20:29,056
We

2792
02:20:29,312 --> 02:20:30,336
Crazy

2793
02:20:31,360 --> 02:20:32,384
So now we have one last

2794
02:20:32,640 --> 02:20:33,152
Okay

2795
02:20:34,176 --> 02:20:40,320
Alex has come there playing video

2796
02:20:40,576 --> 02:20:45,184

02:20:50,048 --> 02:20:51,072
Because it is

2800
02:20:52,864 --> 02:20:53,376
F***** up

2801
02:20:53,632 --> 02:20:57,472
He is still mad about the music a different article

2802
02:20:58,496 --> 02:20:59,264
This is this is

2803
02:21:00,032 --> 02:21:00,544
Happy birthday

2804
02:21:01,312 --> 02:21:02,848
34 like Olivia Lodge

2805
02:21:03,616 --> 02:21:07,200
That's how they do it

2806
02:21:13,856 --> 02:21:20,000
New war started World War

2807
02:21:20,256 --> 02:21:21,792
Want to die

2808
02:21:25,632 --> 02:21:31,008
Has officially turns heel on Humanity

2809
02:21:34,080 --> 02:21:38,432
Whatever they say I'm taking my ball and going home

Just walking out the door just like

2811
02:21:40,224 --> 02:21:43,040
Everybody

02:21:43,296 --> 02:21:47,904
But I don't like

2813
02:21:48,160 --> 02:21:54,304
And everybody

2814
02:21:54,560 --> 02:22:00,192
Because so much of Alex is early career was predicated on this idea that good

2815
02:22:02,752 --> 02:22:04,800
He's powerful and we can we can

2816
02:22:05,056 --> 02:22:08,128
PowerBack for these globalist fit of enslaved us

2817
02:22:08,384 --> 02:22:14,528
Now just because the plug didn't work right

2818
02:22:15,808 --> 02:22:21,952
Controller.com

2819
02:22:22,208 --> 02:22:28,352
CNN's website

2820
02:22:28,864 --> 02:22:31,424
Because of the petty squabble there and that

2821
02:22:33,984 --> 02:22:38,336
They're stupid and they want to die

2822
02:22:45,248 --> 02:22:45,760
Okay

2823
02:22:46,016 --> 02:22:51,136

Because people

2827

W

2828
02:23:08,800 --> 02:23:10,336
They want to die and they're f******

2829
02:23:11,872 --> 02:23:15,712
Website Veiled Threat

2830
02:23:15,968 --> 02:23:17,248
Employee who put the wrong one up

2831
02:23:18,016 --> 02:23:22,880
Doubt that people looking at you

2832
02:23:23,136 --> 02:23:25,440
Guessing you're fired already

2833
02:23:29,024 --> 02:23:31,328
So this episode

2834
02:23:31,584 --> 02:23:32,608
Blows my mind

2835
02:23:32,864 --> 02:23:34,656
From a from a narrative Arc

2836
02:23:37,216 --> 02:23:38,496
Showing up super depressed

2837
02:23:38,752 --> 02:23:41,056
Because you watch a movie about Satanism yesterday

2838
02:23:43,104 --> 02:23:43,616
Weird

2839
02:23:43,872 --> 02:23:45,152
I can Road

2840
02:23:46,688 --> 02:23:49,248
Belgium

2841
02:23:49,504 --> 02:23:54,880
Gunsmoke being factually

2842
02:23:55,904 --> 02:23:57,440
What

2843
02:23:58,208 --> 02:23:59,488
Do this

2844
02:24:00,512 --> 02:24:03,840
Dehumanizing talk about Facebook moderator is it don't even

2845
02:24:04,096 --> 02:24:05,376
Technically work for Facebook

2846
02:24:06,400 --> 02:24:09,984
Just self-serving exploitation of their pain

2847
02:24:10,240 --> 02:24:10,752
Awful

2848
02:24:11,008 --> 02:24:17,152
And then you reach the end it just because he didn't get plug for his own website on his own show

2849
02:24:17,408 --> 02:24:20,480
He throws a tantrum

2850
02:24:20,736 --> 02:24:23,296
I didn't close the narrative Circle they're pretty well

2851
02:24:23,552 --> 02:24:29,440
It's amazing that are like.

2852
02:24:30,208 --> 02:24:32,000
Because of the farcical nature

2853
02:24:33,024 --> 02:24:34,560
It really wasn't so bad

2854
02:24:34,816 --> 02:24:35,584
But it was a lot of

2855
02:24:35,840 --> 02:24:36,352
Stop

2856
02:24:37,376 --> 02:24:38,656
I could handle this

2857
02:24:40,192 --> 02:24:41,216
As much as I hate

2858
02:24:41,472 --> 02:24:41,984
The present day

2859
02:24:42,240 --> 02:24:43,264
I never

2860
02:24:43,520 --> 02:24:45,312
Look forward to listening to it

2861
02:24:45,568 --> 02:24:46,336
This I relish

2862
02:24:46,592 --> 02:24:47,616
This was kind of like a

2863
02:24:48,384 --> 02:24:49,664
You got a lot of meat on the bone

2864
02:24:49,920 --> 02:24:51,456
There's a lot of stuff for me to learn about

2865
02:24:51,712 --> 02:24:53,248
You're acting like a real f******

2866
02:24:55,296 --> 02:24:59,136
So

2867
02:24:59,392 --> 02:25:00,672
In 3 hours

2868
02:25:05,024 --> 02:25:09,120
Tripping my chicken 5-0

2869
02:25:09,376 --> 02:25:10,912
Real real possibility

2870
02:25:11,936 --> 02:25:13,728
Well you know

2871
02:25:13,984 --> 02:25:17,056
Episode on Monday of fun but

2872
02:25:17,312 --> 02:25:18,592
I miss doing this

2873
02:25:19,872 --> 02:25:21,664
Actually covering his stuff

2874
02:25:26,016 --> 02:25:27,040
I'm glad this

2875
02:25:27,552 --> 02:25:28,064
My well

2876
02:25:28,576 --> 02:25:29,600
We're technically still

2877
02:25:29,856 --> 02:25:30,368
Finishing

2878
02:25:30,624 --> 02:25:33,696
Run time for me to go to therapy

2879
02:25:36,768 --> 02:25:42,400
I think we have a website.com

2880
02:25:42,656 --> 02:25:48,800
Twitter

2881
02:25:51,360 --> 02:25:54,432
So many other places I might bite the bullet get on Spotify

2882
02:25:54,688 --> 02:25:55,968
Let's do it

2883
02:25:56,480 --> 02:25:59,808
Has to be a month-long conversation

2884
02:26:00,064 --> 02:26:01,600
But basically how we start

2885
02:26:01,856 --> 02:26:02,624
A butt

2886
02:26:03,392 --> 02:26:03,904
I don't know this is

2887
02:26:06,208 --> 02:26:07,744
I don't think we have a hero here

2888
02:26:08,000 --> 02:26:10,048
Gyros

2889
02:26:10,560 --> 02:26:15,936
Alright

2890
02:26:16,192 --> 02:26:22,336
That's an interesting one for this week

2891
02:26:22,592 --> 02:26:23,104
People

2892
02:26:23,616 --> 02:26:24,384
Fire

2893
02:26:24,896 --> 02:26:28,480
Okay and also not talking about the fictional portrayals

2894
02:26:28,736 --> 02:26:31,808
A literal has never killed anybody

2895
02:26:36,416 --> 02:26:38,464
Holding

2896
02:26:40,512 --> 02:26:44,096
