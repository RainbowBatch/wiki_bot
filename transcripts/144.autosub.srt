1
00:00:04,096 --> 00:00:07,680
Alexandra Thurston color with your Japan I love your work

2
00:00:07,936 --> 00:00:13,568
Part

3
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:19,200
It was last week of the week of

4
00:00:19,712 --> 00:00:20,224
Mark

5
00:00:21,248 --> 00:00:23,552
March 30th

6
00:00:23,808 --> 00:00:26,368
1

7
00:00:26,624 --> 00:00:29,696
I completely understand

8
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:31,232
Listen to part 1

9
00:00:31,488 --> 00:00:33,536
Watch the taste out of your mouth

10
00:00:33,792 --> 00:00:37,632
If you are listening to this immediately after listening to part 1

11
00:00:37,888 --> 00:00:38,656
Let me tell you something

12
00:00:39,168 --> 00:00:40,192
Go go get it

13
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:48,384
Jacob is promising me this will be

14
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:49,920
The most fun I've ever had

15
00:00:57,088 --> 00:01:03,232
You going to write my feelings on California

16
00:01:07,072 --> 00:01:07,584
Immediately after

17
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:13,984
I would like a new donor what's going on

18
00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:20,640
Absolutely if you are Kirk Cameron

19
00:01:20,896 --> 00:01:23,200
Weird that you listen to the show

20
00:01:23,456 --> 00:01:29,600
Very disappointed very disappointed I thought you were going to go with Captain Kirk

21
00:01:29,856 --> 00:01:33,440
Fictional character

22
00:01:33,696 --> 00:01:37,792
I was hoping you would go a Captain Kirk cuz then I was going to Pivot that

23
00:01:38,048 --> 00:01:39,072
Tri Pointe

24
00:01:39,328 --> 00:01:45,472
Master P song on the ghetto D album

25
00:01:46,496 --> 00:01:47,520
Called Captain Kirk

26
00:01:47,776 --> 00:01:48,544
Featuring

27
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:49,312
Fiend

28
00:01:49,824 --> 00:01:51,872
I can't believe the other feature is might have been big at the

29
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:53,920
The Assassin

30
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:55,456
But it's about how Mass

31
00:01:55,712 --> 00:01:56,736
Master P of Captain Kirk

32
00:01:57,248 --> 00:01:58,272
Andy's eyes

33
00:01:58,528 --> 00:02:04,672
Put up with these hoes that will happen

34
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:06,464
You will have to put up with her

35
00:02:07,744 --> 00:02:09,792
The chorus of it I don't know who was it might have been

36
00:02:10,048 --> 00:02:10,560
Next

37
00:02:10,816 --> 00:02:12,352
It might have been one of the other ladies

38
00:02:12,608 --> 00:02:18,752
You didn't really have album Beals level that is

39
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:23,104
Can you

40
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:27,200
Captain Kirk I want to have your baby

41
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:32,064
The good thing is an elaborate metaphor for how

42
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,344
Master P now that

43
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,112
He has

44
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:35,392
Record ended

45
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:42,048
Success can be women out of the ghetto

46
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:44,096
I just need time

47
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:47,424
But at the same time I enjoy the creativity of a metaphor because

48
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,472
On the level of No Limit Records

49
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:54,592
That was unheard of the level of extended metaphor

50
00:02:54,848 --> 00:03:00,736
I feel like this is way better than if I had let you in anyways

51
00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:07,904
You really left behind

52
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:14,304
You can by going to a website and I was right. Com

53
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,072
Pizza Port

54
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:20,448
Amazon body left behind I don't know I don't know how

55
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:31,456
Wherever record stores still exist yet still better than the last Don

56
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:32,736
His follow-up CC

57
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:33,504
Bymaster

58
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:34,528
Terrible

59
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,624
I Miss my Homies

60
00:03:41,696 --> 00:03:43,488
Anyways

61
00:03:43,744 --> 00:03:47,840
Let's just see how far this goes unfortunately

62
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:49,120
Entire catalog was by

63
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:51,168
C-Murder who end up murdering somebody

64
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:54,496
Like

65
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:56,800
The definition of not Irish

66
00:03:57,056 --> 00:03:59,616
He has a lyric literally that is

67
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:03,200
You take the key out my name in your left with a homicide

68
00:04:03,968 --> 00:04:08,064
We just followed up by the ghetto makes me crazy

69
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:12,928
His lawyer his lawyer argued in court

70
00:04:13,184 --> 00:04:13,696
That he was

71
00:04:13,952 --> 00:04:14,464
Incapable

72
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,768
The crime Bahamas my name is

73
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:19,071
C-Murder

74
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:24,703
Catalog

75
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:27,519
If you disagree please send an email to knowledge fight at

76
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:29,567
Gmail.com

77
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:30,591
Don't do it

78
00:04:30,847 --> 00:04:36,991
Don't you don't want to you don't want to open that can of worms add an also mr. Serv on to the next level is a great album

79
00:04:37,247 --> 00:04:41,855
Also like strong as articles

80
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:45,695
The email that you will get about No Limit Records

81
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:46,719
Will be

82
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:49,279
400 pages long

83
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:51,839
Respectable work

84
00:04:52,095 --> 00:04:56,703
The game is to be sold not to be told by Snoop Dogg was kind of disappointed

85
00:04:56,959 --> 00:04:58,495
Yeah I think it's

86
00:04:59,519 --> 00:05:00,799
Remember how we spell

87
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:07,711
Despite your Everlasting knowledge of an element

88
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:10,015
In terms of that misspeaking I would like to say

89
00:05:10,271 --> 00:05:11,551
It ain't my fault

90
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:14,623
It ain't my fault

91
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:15,391
Alright

92
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:16,671
What did you do

93
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:21,023
Did we already say that you know a lot about Alex Jones

94
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:24,351
IPhone spoiler alerts the Shocker and Mystikal.

95
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:26,143
Thank you very much

96
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:27,935
They did two versions of it ain't my

97
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:29,983
My fault

98
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:33,055
But unlike unlike a lot

99
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:33,823
These assholes

100
00:05:34,335 --> 00:05:36,639
I'm talking about Michael McDonald and Kenny Loggins

101
00:05:36,895 --> 00:05:43,039
How dare you they would make you are not even allowed to put those names in your mouth Sir Michael McDonald Kenny Loggins

102
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:44,319
New versions of like

103
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:45,855
Taking it to the streets

104
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:51,999
This is it like they would write them together

105
00:05:53,535 --> 00:05:54,047
Just ate like

106
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:55,327
1

107
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:58,143
Beyond both of their album

108
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:00,703
But it would be the same song

109
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:07,359
You just finished this is exactly

110
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:15,551
My point is disgusting shocker and Mystikal when they did it ain't my fault

111
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:18,111
The Shocker cares all right

112
00:06:18,367 --> 00:06:20,671
Do I need it ain't my fault my fault

113
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:28,351
Totally different songs just like this part 1 and part 2 of

114
00:06:28,607 --> 00:06:29,887
Metaphor

115
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:31,167
It ain't my fault

116
00:06:31,423 --> 00:06:33,215
What is Alex's fault

117
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:39,615
Entirely on the last episode of the Sunday episode

118
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:40,639
Better transition than

119
00:06:40,895 --> 00:06:41,407
So we talk

120
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:47,807
Come on Dan I expect more of you

121
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:52,159
Episode where

122
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:59,327
Owen Shroyer introduce the ideas like we need our own David Hogg

123
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:00,351
Alex

124
00:07:00,607 --> 00:07:05,983
There wasn't really anything else all that interesting that happened so that will be the last off of today's episode

125
00:07:06,495 --> 00:07:09,311
Also left off of today's episode

126
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:10,591
Monday 5:20

127
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:13,663
There's really nothing all that much that we need to talk about

128
00:07:14,175 --> 00:07:15,199
Except that

129
00:07:16,223 --> 00:07:17,247
Mike cernovich

130
00:07:17,503 --> 00:07:18,015
Shows up

131
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:23,391
Accidentally reveals

132
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:25,183
No

133
00:07:25,695 --> 00:07:27,231
Actually straight up being like

134
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:29,023
He's doing the

135
00:07:29,279 --> 00:07:32,095
The move that I'm going to call the Paul Joseph Watson

136
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:33,631
Which is

137
00:07:33,887 --> 00:07:34,911
Just call it D Mike cernovich

138
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:37,215
From six months ago okay I'm done with Trump

139
00:07:37,471 --> 00:07:42,079
Trump doesn't care about us

140
00:07:43,359 --> 00:07:46,431
You stupid motherfukers

141
00:07:46,687 --> 00:07:48,479
You got played by a pro

142
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:50,783
So he ends up

143
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:53,855
Expressing on this episode

144
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:57,439
And that is mentality really reveal

145
00:07:58,207 --> 00:07:58,975
Only cares about money

146
00:07:59,487 --> 00:08:00,511
Listen to that really

147
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:04,863
Alabama

148
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:06,911
Unplug my videos

149
00:08:07,167 --> 00:08:11,263
I would sell a thousand copies plug it and sell none

150
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:14,335
Did There's zombies watching its background noise

151
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:15,871
It's elevator music

152
00:08:18,687 --> 00:08:24,831
And actually NBC wanted to do a big interview with me and I told the guy who seemed like a nice guy said

153
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:32,255
I'm just bored with people coming in and trying to bring up irrelevant stuff

154
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:35,583
Because it doesn't move the needle for me being on NBC

155
00:08:42,239 --> 00:08:43,775
0 blocks

156
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:55,039
13 hours

157
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:56,831
But when I come on your show

158
00:08:57,087 --> 00:09:03,231
Mindset has over 1000 reviews on Amazon and also 100 just like that

159
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:10,143
That's one Theory

160
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:16,799
Snowboards QVC for unemployable pairing

161
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:20,895
Threat

162
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:21,919
Sailfish

163
00:09:22,175 --> 00:09:24,479
And that's what he's doing there

164
00:09:24,735 --> 00:09:30,111
Extending the sale for exactly 1 hour

165
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:36,767
These are sales as for the for the first time in a year

166
00:09:37,023 --> 00:09:40,607
That joke is probably relevant

167
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:42,143
Simoniz

168
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:47,263
DirecTV

169
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:48,543
Also the rest

170
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:49,311
The show is just

171
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:52,639
Lot of nonsense a lot of him yelling about

172
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:53,663
David Hogg

173
00:09:54,687 --> 00:10:00,831
Still Thursday

174
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:03,647
It's not really all that into

175
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:05,951
So we do not need

176
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:10,047
Fascinating

177
00:10:10,303 --> 00:10:11,071
People recognize

178
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:12,351
How sad they are

179
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:14,143
Attacking

180
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:14,911
David Hall

181
00:10:15,679 --> 00:10:20,799
Like they'd like

182
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:23,103
Like they're so

183
00:10:23,359 --> 00:10:24,895
Green in this concept of

184
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:26,175
Viciously attacking

185
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:28,223
Anyone who disagrees with them

186
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:30,271
That the moment like they don't

187
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:31,039
Get

188
00:10:33,087 --> 00:10:34,111
And this is a child

189
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:40,511
Who has survived trauma that they will never understand people never even be able to comprehend that buy something

190
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:46,399
I'm so much

191
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:48,703
Just attack people suck

192
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:50,751
The consequences

193
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:55,615
Regardless of what or who those people are

194
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:56,383
It is

195
00:10:56,639 --> 00:10:59,967
Kind of an interesting thing to realize that their defense you do

196
00:11:00,223 --> 00:11:01,247
Alex Jones is like

197
00:11:01,503 --> 00:11:02,015
He's

198
00:11:02,783 --> 00:11:03,295
Motto

199
00:11:03,807 --> 00:11:04,319
Should just be

200
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:06,879
F*** the contacts

201
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:08,927
Because that kind of behavior is

202
00:11:11,231 --> 00:11:11,999
Nubian like fuc

203
00:11:12,255 --> 00:11:12,767
Suck it

204
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:14,303
Always have the same

205
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:16,607
Mode of operation that is attack

206
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:17,375
Why

207
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:21,471
Is there was a nine-year-old that was a lie

208
00:11:23,263 --> 00:11:27,103
5 year old baby with a YouTube video where their parents were like

209
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:32,735
He would be like that

210
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:34,015
The f****** globalist

211
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:37,599
He would start getting into like

212
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:38,623
Some people are

213
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:42,975
Shockingly advance that young ages

214
00:11:46,047 --> 00:11:48,095
He probably an indigo child

215
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:51,423
Start flipping into Project Camelot yet

216
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:53,983
Two things I needed

217
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:55,007
Yes

218
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:56,543
It was my

219
00:11:57,055 --> 00:11:58,847
Sincere intention

220
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:03,711
To surprise you with the Project Camelot episode for your first episode

221
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:05,759
I'm disappointed

222
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:07,295
Well here's why

223
00:12:08,575 --> 00:12:10,623
I listen to an episode where she talked to

224
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:11,391
Lady

225
00:12:11,647 --> 00:12:12,159
You talk to alien

226
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:14,719
She mentioned

227
00:12:15,487 --> 00:12:16,511
I had just gotten back

228
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:18,047
From talking to Mark Richards

229
00:12:20,351 --> 00:12:22,911
Yeah okay but

230
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:24,959
Wife cumming

231
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:31,359
But it hasn't come out yet so I got it yet

232
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:32,895
Did do

233
00:12:34,431 --> 00:12:35,711
One of them is about Parkland

234
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:40,575
How much worse

235
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:41,599
She is

236
00:12:42,111 --> 00:12:42,623
Then we thought

237
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:43,903
No we can't

238
00:12:44,159 --> 00:12:47,487
I wish you hadn't even told me that Robin Alex

239
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:48,767
And then

240
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:51,839
She didn't episode about the guy Delight in ruining the world

241
00:12:52,351 --> 00:12:56,191
These two guys who wrote a book about

242
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:57,983
The real Cowboys & Aliens

243
00:12:58,239 --> 00:13:01,311
Yes I do remember that movie Harrison Ford

244
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:06,431
And they wrote a book

245
00:13:06,687 --> 00:13:10,527
Smokers they wrote a book about it it's so boring

246
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:12,063
Such a boring

247
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:14,623
Interview except for one point where the

248
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:16,159
What are the geysers

249
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:18,207
I can't lie

250
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:22,815
Me and this guy we met each other in federal prison

251
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:34,591
Fusion of methamphetamine

252
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:37,407
Alright

253
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:42,783
Tavares he was selling fake methamphetamines now is to differ

254
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:51,999
So do I get into Tuesday

255
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:58,655
This that this is where we get actual Alex Jones

256
00:13:58,911 --> 00:14:02,495
Popping back up back into it

257
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:08,895
Call Steven

258
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:11,711
Calling for the repeal

259
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:13,247
The Second Amendment

260
00:14:13,503 --> 00:14:15,295
WYD

261
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:17,343
Complication we've got his editorial

262
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:19,135
New York

263
00:14:19,647 --> 00:14:21,183
Infowars.com

264
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:22,719
Now here's the problem

265
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:25,023
John Paul Stevens

266
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:26,559
Rhoda editorial

267
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:28,095
New York Times

268
00:14:28,607 --> 00:14:29,119
Called

269
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:30,143
Headline

270
00:14:30,655 --> 00:14:31,679
Repeal the second event

271
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:32,447
Yes

272
00:14:32,703 --> 00:14:33,471
There's the problem

273
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:38,079
Yeah now it says reads

274
00:14:39,615 --> 00:14:41,151
And so if you actually read

275
00:14:41,407 --> 00:14:42,431
The the argument

276
00:14:42,687 --> 00:14:44,991
He's making

277
00:14:45,247 --> 00:14:51,391
All laid out for those who have not read it that he's making is it until 2008

278
00:14:51,903 --> 00:14:53,695
Not really understanding that

279
00:14:53,951 --> 00:14:55,231
The Second Amendment

280
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:55,999
Provided for

281
00:14:56,255 --> 00:14:56,767
Protection of

282
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:58,303
Individual ownership

283
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:00,607
At that point there was the district

284
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:02,143
Columbia vs. Heller Decision

285
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:04,447
And that created the idea

286
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:05,727
That

287
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:09,055
The Second Amendment wasn't about a well-ordered militia

288
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:10,591
And it was about your right

289
00:15:10,847 --> 00:15:12,127
Right to carry guns

290
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:18,527
For that the

291
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:24,927
Corvette stolen election

292
00:15:25,183 --> 00:15:30,815
They would but it was not like a across-the-board the Supreme Court everyone agree

293
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:37,215
Amendment was more or less understood the historical

294
00:15:37,471 --> 00:15:38,239
That the states

295
00:15:39,007 --> 00:15:39,519
How to write

296
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:41,311
To keep a militia in case one

297
00:15:41,567 --> 00:15:44,383
The other states attacked them or the federal government attack

298
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:45,407
Them yeah

299
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:50,527
Real intent

300
00:15:51,039 --> 00:15:55,647
A he did was he wrote a an editorial

301
00:15:55,903 --> 00:15:56,671
Was based in

302
00:15:57,183 --> 00:15:57,695
Legally

303
00:15:58,207 --> 00:15:58,719
Essentially

304
00:15:58,975 --> 00:16:05,119
He wasn't making an impassioned like ideological argument he was making a historical League

305
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:06,911
Legal argument right

306
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:07,935
Admittedly

307
00:16:08,191 --> 00:16:09,215
He's a piece of s***

308
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:09,983
But

309
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:12,799
It was a good day was good argument

310
00:16:13,055 --> 00:16:14,847
But I think my favorite part

311
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:17,407
The article was when

312
00:16:17,663 --> 00:16:20,735
Talking about the NRA

313
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:26,367
In in pushing the narrative that the Second Amendment means that everyone has the right to

314
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:28,159
And carry guns

315
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:30,463
The NRA was perpetuating quote

316
00:16:30,719 --> 00:16:31,743
One of the greatest

317
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:37,119
Pieces of fraud I repeat the word fraud on the American public by special interest groups

318
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:38,655
That I have ever seen in my life

319
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:40,191
Which

320
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:40,959
Is

321
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:42,239
Incorrect

322
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:43,519
He's a very old man

323
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:50,431
But that doesn't take away from the fact

324
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:52,479
The thrust of what he means

325
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:54,527
This is bulshit

326
00:16:56,319 --> 00:17:00,927
It's weird to come down on the side of John Paul Stevens whenever his

327
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:01,951
Many of his

328
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:03,743
Decisions in his boat

329
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:05,023
I have been

330
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:08,863
Silver aggressive towards racial Injustice

331
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:13,727
It's been it's been an issue for me how how many of these people who come out and

332
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:15,263
Are suddenly like

333
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:19,103
Here's what we should do in this is awful in their lifetime

334
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:22,175
Prior to being retired or quitting

335
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:23,199
Right

336
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:25,247
Truly horrific

337
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:31,647
It's so strange writing a novel that

338
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:34,207
Talk about that I can't do it

339
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:35,231
Sinnerman

340
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:37,023
Stop

341
00:17:37,279 --> 00:17:38,815
You think you're helping but you're not

342
00:17:39,071 --> 00:17:42,399
Turns on Trump

343
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:44,703
You'll be like a I can help

344
00:17:44,959 --> 00:17:47,519
Stop

345
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:48,799
Like

346
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:52,895
The thing that the thing that got me about when Hillary Clinton was asked about

347
00:17:53,151 --> 00:17:54,175
How

348
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:56,991
People have told her like go away

349
00:17:57,247 --> 00:17:58,783
A response was

350
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:01,855
Well none of the other presidents none of these other males

351
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:08,255
We're told to go away they were tacitly allowed to do all of this b*******

352
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:15,423
He was like yes

353
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:16,959
Totally have a

354
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:18,239
Reasonable argument

355
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:19,775
About sexism

356
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:20,543
Howard has

357
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:26,943
Destroyed you should have gone away to

358
00:18:27,967 --> 00:18:30,783
Yeah like I'm 40 you're right you're right

359
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:34,367
Big should have been told to go away in the same way that we're telling you now

360
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:40,767
Like that is that is absolutely true

361
00:18:41,023 --> 00:18:44,863
And and not allowed to do that is undoubtedly due to sexism

362
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:45,887
Also

363
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:46,911
Go away

364
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:53,311
It's it's more immediately after his

365
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:56,383
Presidency so many of those speaking engagement

366
00:18:56,639 --> 00:18:57,663
So many of those

367
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:02,271
Lobbying issues where he's being paid obscene amounts of money

368
00:19:02,527 --> 00:19:04,575
To just be like hey guess what I'm the president

369
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:07,647
Pretty great

370
00:19:07,903 --> 00:19:11,999
Like I totally agree

371
00:19:12,255 --> 00:19:13,279
More the fault

372
00:19:13,535 --> 00:19:14,559
Is that weed

373
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:20,191
Never told other people to go away

374
00:19:20,447 --> 00:19:21,983
But also I would argue

375
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:23,263
Kind of a measure of sex

376
00:19:23,775 --> 00:19:29,151
Because no one got up in arms about how like it up before

377
00:19:29,407 --> 00:19:32,991
You were being a little

378
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:34,271
Totally

379
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:35,551
Totally recognize

380
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:37,855
Involved

381
00:19:38,111 --> 00:19:38,623
With this

382
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:39,647
This situation

383
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:43,231
However I have also said that Bill Clinton is a rapist

384
00:19:43,487 --> 00:19:46,559
Best others that

385
00:19:46,815 --> 00:19:51,935
I don't know what to say I don't know what to say like maybe the only president who should

386
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:52,959
Continue talking

387
00:19:53,215 --> 00:19:53,727
Is Jimmy Carter

388
00:19:53,983 --> 00:19:55,263
When he was president

389
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:56,543
He was a pile of garbage

390
00:19:56,799 --> 00:20:02,943
Building houses for the homeless

391
00:20:03,199 --> 00:20:06,783
Appreciate atoning for his miserable mistake

392
00:20:07,295 --> 00:20:10,111
So I want to talk a little bit more about this John Paul Stevens thing

393
00:20:10,367 --> 00:20:15,487
Because sorry for derailing you weird

394
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:22,143
Ignition

395
00:20:22,399 --> 00:20:25,215
Here's the issue with the John Paul Stevens

396
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:27,263
Because he's talking about.

397
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:28,799
DC vs. Heller being

398
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:32,895
The issue where we come into like people having the right to own guns as the ins

399
00:20:33,151 --> 00:20:34,687
Interpretation of the Second Amendment yes

400
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:36,991
It's all meaningless

401
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:38,015
Because

402
00:20:38,527 --> 00:20:41,087
If you actually read DC vs. Heller

403
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:42,623
It's the Second Amendment

404
00:20:42,879 --> 00:20:44,671
They ruled is compatible with

405
00:20:44,927 --> 00:20:47,999
With gun control the second page

406
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:51,071
DC vs. Heller the Supreme Court decision

407
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:52,095
Quote

408
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:53,119
Like many rights

409
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:55,167
The Second Amendment right is not Unlimited

410
00:20:55,423 --> 00:20:56,447
It is not a right

411
00:20:56,703 --> 00:21:01,055
Keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever and for whatever purpose

412
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:02,335
For example

413
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:03,103
Concealed weapon

414
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:04,127
Prohibition

415
00:21:04,383 --> 00:21:07,199
Have been upheld under the amendment or state analog

416
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:09,759
To cast doubt

417
00:21:10,015 --> 00:21:12,319
Unlock daily prohibitions on the possession of firearms

418
00:21:12,575 --> 00:21:15,391
Fallon and the mentally ill or laws prohibiting

419
00:21:15,903 --> 00:21:20,512
Firearms in sensitive places

420
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:22,304
Such as Schools and Government buildings

421
00:21:22,816 --> 00:21:23,840
Or laws imposing

422
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:25,120
Conditions

423
00:21:25,376 --> 00:21:25,888
Only come

424
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:28,448
All of that

425
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:29,984
Everything that Alex Jones

426
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,520
Complains about everything that Aldi

427
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:32,288
He's gone right

428
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:34,080
People are super afraid of

429
00:21:34,848 --> 00:21:35,872
Even in the decision

430
00:21:37,152 --> 00:21:39,456
The Second Amendment is being you ever right scary

431
00:21:39,712 --> 00:21:40,736
It and that

432
00:21:40,992 --> 00:21:42,016
Passage ends with

433
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:44,576
It's compatible with laws imposing

434
00:21:44,832 --> 00:21:45,344
Conditions and koala

435
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:47,392
Vacation on the commercial sale of arms

436
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:48,160
Which is

437
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:49,440
Registration

438
00:21:49,696 --> 00:21:50,208
Which is

439
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:51,488
Harder background

440
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,280
Which is legitimately

441
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:55,328
That the

442
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:56,864
Rational minded

443
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:57,632
People are asking

444
00:21:58,912 --> 00:21:59,680
The only people who were asked

445
00:21:59,936 --> 00:22:00,448
Looking for like

446
00:22:00,704 --> 00:22:01,216
No God

447
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,056
Before Alice's Boogeyman

448
00:22:07,616 --> 00:22:08,640
Except

449
00:22:08,896 --> 00:22:09,408
Gun

450
00:22:09,664 --> 00:22:12,480
They were regulated the same way as

451
00:22:12,736 --> 00:22:13,248
Roller coaster

452
00:22:14,016 --> 00:22:14,528
Like that

453
00:22:15,040 --> 00:22:18,112
You're not allowed to build a commercial Road

454
00:22:19,648 --> 00:22:23,232
Like I'd rather just fine recently a kid died

455
00:22:25,024 --> 00:22:25,536
Like

456
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:28,864
Huge elaborate water slide and the guy who

457
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:31,424
Ed and the guy

458
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:33,216
Alex isn't talking about that now

459
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:34,496
Hey David

460
00:22:35,264 --> 00:22:37,056
The same thing like I'm fine look

461
00:22:37,312 --> 00:22:39,872
People like to shoot guns and I respect

462
00:22:40,128 --> 00:22:41,664
Probably super fun

463
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:48,064
You're probably go shoot a gun I should learn how to shoot a gun in order to obtain water I will probably

464
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:50,624
Why dig one of our listeners actually

465
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:57,024
Jacking off right now

466
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:59,328
Agreed that that would be super cool

467
00:22:59,584 --> 00:23:04,192
If that was the only place where you were allowed to shoot guns as a private citizen

468
00:23:04,704 --> 00:23:05,984
That would be awesome

469
00:23:06,496 --> 00:23:09,568
Lego guns were part of an amusement

470
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:13,664
Like a larger Music Park where people were

471
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:19,552
I would have to get a permit to build a water slide in your back

472
00:23:19,808 --> 00:23:23,904
I would imagine that

473
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:28,768
You are allowed to build a water park in your backyard

474
00:23:29,024 --> 00:23:31,840
So I think you probably would have to be

475
00:23:32,096 --> 00:23:36,960
Subway license like you can take care of this man. Going to hurt people

476
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:39,264
You shouldn't be allowed to do

477
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,288
Just walk around with guns

478
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:41,568
Sprinkler

479
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:43,360
I don't think law

480
00:23:43,616 --> 00:23:44,896
I should be allowed to walk around with

481
00:23:45,152 --> 00:23:50,528
So very responsible

482
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:51,552
Drive

483
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:53,088
Like they they

484
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:54,112
Hit that woman

485
00:23:54,368 --> 00:23:57,696
What is like to lick you and I texted you literally said

486
00:23:58,208 --> 00:24:00,512
Law enforcement is now is

487
00:24:00,768 --> 00:24:02,560
Always has been

488
00:24:03,072 --> 00:24:03,584
Hey

489
00:24:04,096 --> 00:24:05,888
An inherently white supremacist

490
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:09,728
Defense of a white supremacist

491
00:24:09,984 --> 00:24:13,056
You see that through the way that I saw operates

492
00:24:13,312 --> 00:24:14,848
You see that illiterate away that

493
00:24:17,408 --> 00:24:18,432
Here's the cow black

494
00:24:18,688 --> 00:24:19,456
People

495
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:26,624
Anyway police officers are white supremacists but it is to say that

496
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,672
The system that you participated

497
00:24:28,928 --> 00:24:31,488
Is white the reverse of a composition fallacy

498
00:24:31,744 --> 00:24:34,560
You are a part of a

499
00:24:34,816 --> 00:24:35,840
Therefore the group

500
00:24:36,096 --> 00:24:37,120
Is the same as you

501
00:24:37,632 --> 00:24:39,680
It made the reverse of it is to say

502
00:24:39,936 --> 00:24:43,776
This is the character of the group therefore you are exactly like the dark

503
00:24:44,032 --> 00:24:46,336
Yes and it is it is the same thing

504
00:24:46,592 --> 00:24:47,104
It's the

505
00:24:47,872 --> 00:24:49,408
Just because law enforcement

506
00:24:50,688 --> 00:24:51,968
To be about defending white rice

507
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:52,992
White property

508
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:57,088
That doesn't mean that every copy

509
00:24:58,368 --> 00:25:00,416
System needs to be

510
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:08,096
Here's one place

511
00:25:08,352 --> 00:25:09,120
Which is that

512
00:25:09,376 --> 00:25:12,448
If you are if you

513
00:25:12,704 --> 00:25:13,472
Do you want to run

514
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:15,776
You should

515
00:25:16,032 --> 00:25:17,568
First submit to

516
00:25:19,104 --> 00:25:20,640
The death-penalty preemptive

517
00:25:21,408 --> 00:25:24,992
It's like if you become president if you do make it eight years

518
00:25:25,248 --> 00:25:27,040
Route whenever you're terman

519
00:25:27,552 --> 00:25:28,064
You should

520
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:29,856
Willingly submit to being

521
00:25:30,368 --> 00:25:34,464
Only way to accept the responsibility for what

522
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:35,232
Interesting

523
00:25:35,744 --> 00:25:37,024
I think I think that's

524
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:41,888
The dystopian view but I also dig a little

525
00:25:42,144 --> 00:25:44,448
Exile

526
00:25:44,704 --> 00:25:50,080
Exile whatever you like so long

527
00:25:50,336 --> 00:25:54,432
But the ideas like you make your changes you rule is Estates

528
00:25:54,688 --> 00:25:59,552
Your f****** gone

529
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:00,576
Strategically

530
00:26:01,856 --> 00:26:05,952
Even if I were to

531
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:06,976
Like ice

532
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:07,744
I kind of think

533
00:26:08,256 --> 00:26:11,328
And this is something that I might wind up

534
00:26:12,608 --> 00:26:13,632
Elucidating

535
00:26:13,888 --> 00:26:14,400
Further

536
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:15,424
Through

537
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,192
True right

538
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:17,984
Is that

539
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,264
I think I

540
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,032
Could

541
00:26:20,544 --> 00:26:22,080
If I were elected

542
00:26:22,336 --> 00:26:22,848
Supreme leader

543
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,152
With complete autocratic

544
00:26:25,664 --> 00:26:26,432
Eyebrows

545
00:26:26,688 --> 00:26:27,712
I think I could

546
00:26:27,968 --> 00:26:28,736
Fix everything

547
00:26:30,016 --> 00:26:33,856
Before I would ever do that I would submit to

548
00:26:34,112 --> 00:26:36,416
I am going to be murdered at the end of

549
00:26:37,184 --> 00:26:42,304
We are too because that's the only way that's the only way to avoid becoming guy autocratic

550
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:44,096
Dictator that's so many communist

551
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:44,864
Socialist

552
00:26:45,376 --> 00:26:47,424
Countries have wound up having

553
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:49,728
Like that that's how you get the Fidel Castro

554
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,032
If Fidel had been like

555
00:26:52,288 --> 00:26:53,312
We're going to

556
00:26:53,568 --> 00:26:54,848
Complete this revolution

557
00:26:55,104 --> 00:26:57,408
I'm going to do whatever it is I need to do

558
00:26:57,664 --> 00:26:58,944
And then you guys get to murder me

559
00:27:01,504 --> 00:27:03,040
That would

560
00:27:03,552 --> 00:27:04,832
Creative baby

561
00:27:05,088 --> 00:27:05,856
Staples

562
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:08,160
Or wouldn't

563
00:27:08,672 --> 00:27:10,720
But you'll be dead soon

564
00:27:10,976 --> 00:27:17,120
And then another dictator would show up and take over

565
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:23,520
So we should be removed

566
00:27:23,776 --> 00:27:27,104
Speaking of God

567
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,128
On the 27th

568
00:27:28,384 --> 00:27:30,432
Alex Jones one of his gas

569
00:27:31,456 --> 00:27:32,480
Jack Purcell

570
00:27:32,992 --> 00:27:34,016
Talk about it

571
00:27:34,272 --> 00:27:37,088
Because he went down to the March for our lives

572
00:27:37,344 --> 00:27:42,464
And he saw but he saw a bunch of buses

573
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:43,232
Quiet

574
00:27:43,488 --> 00:27:46,560
Great so I don't know a bunch of

575
00:27:46,816 --> 00:27:50,656
Disparate organization anyone guy

576
00:27:51,424 --> 00:27:54,752
Who cares about that stuff

577
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,080
Alex has another guest

578
00:28:00,896 --> 00:28:02,688
I'm thrilled that you showed up

579
00:28:02,944 --> 00:28:05,248
Ben Garrison

580
00:28:05,504 --> 00:28:11,648
Do you know about Ben Garrison

581
00:28:11,904 --> 00:28:13,184
Cartoonist of the alt right

582
00:28:16,512 --> 00:28:17,536
I'm going to

583
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:20,352
Reject

584
00:28:20,864 --> 00:28:24,448
Sprinkler head over here this is one of his political cartoon right here

585
00:28:24,704 --> 00:28:28,800
This is one you can find on his website it's about California being in a

586
00:28:29,056 --> 00:28:30,336
Shoot off with Jeff session

587
00:28:30,848 --> 00:28:32,640
If you look around here you'll see

588
00:28:32,896 --> 00:28:34,944
The Golden Bear Saloon here with that welcomes

589
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:35,712
Immigrant

590
00:28:35,968 --> 00:28:39,296
If you want to see this picture it's also on knowledge fight.com we have it

591
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:41,088
You look into salute no ice

592
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:44,928
That guy right there

593
00:28:45,184 --> 00:28:48,256
Gang written on his head

594
00:28:48,512 --> 00:28:49,024
Label

595
00:28:49,536 --> 00:28:50,560
Sanctuary

596
00:28:52,096 --> 00:28:58,240
Governor labeled California to be a

597
00:28:58,496 --> 00:28:59,008
Nickel cartoon

598
00:28:59,264 --> 00:29:01,056
Perhaps the cartoon

599
00:29:01,312 --> 00:29:07,456
Itself should be representative of what it is you're trying to say as opposed to you just right

600
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:13,856
Writing it out there that would be

601
00:29:14,112 --> 00:29:16,416
For what is style is

602
00:29:16,928 --> 00:29:18,208
Overlay ballistics

603
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:22,560
And if you look at his cartoons it's almost comical the extent

604
00:29:22,816 --> 00:29:23,840
To go

605
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:24,864
Do so much work

606
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,144
To make it make sense by like

607
00:29:27,936 --> 00:29:32,544
Which means he's a bad cartoon

608
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:33,312
Craft

609
00:29:34,336 --> 00:29:35,872
But I will

610
00:29:36,896 --> 00:29:38,176
He shows up on in Floresville

611
00:29:38,688 --> 00:29:44,832
Do the cowboy hat cowboy hat have his name on it

612
00:29:45,088 --> 00:29:51,232
Because that is essentially what he does is a cartoon posted in the Facebook group this is not a drill

613
00:29:51,488 --> 00:29:53,024
Ben Garrison is on Infowars

614
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:59,424
The clown Donovan the group before

615
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:00,960
Jim chimed in is

616
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:03,264
Labeled there we go

617
00:30:03,776 --> 00:30:05,824
Alright

618
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:08,640
Just keeps talking to him about like

619
00:30:08,896 --> 00:30:09,920
Your work is perfect

620
00:30:10,176 --> 00:30:13,248
And all this picture clearly cuz he wants to sell

621
00:30:14,272 --> 00:30:15,040
Coffee table books

622
00:30:15,296 --> 00:30:17,088
Of his cartoon

623
00:30:17,344 --> 00:30:18,624
He makes it clear

624
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:20,928
841

625
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:23,744
You know what the best part of graphic novels

626
00:30:24,256 --> 00:30:26,816
Is that they never let the images speak for themselves

627
00:30:27,328 --> 00:30:29,376
Never

628
00:30:29,632 --> 00:30:31,680
They always over label every panel

629
00:30:31,936 --> 00:30:33,216
I would say that like

630
00:30:33,728 --> 00:30:34,752
The Pharcyde

631
00:30:35,008 --> 00:30:36,032
Left you up

632
00:30:37,312 --> 00:30:38,848
There'd be the caption

633
00:30:39,104 --> 00:30:40,384
Not like

634
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:43,200
Bear

635
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:47,808
Feel like explaining

636
00:30:48,064 --> 00:30:50,624
Somebody holding a basketball and then a label thing

637
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:51,648
Basketball play

638
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:52,672
Sport

639
00:30:52,928 --> 00:30:53,696
Exactly

640
00:30:54,208 --> 00:30:54,720
Tortoise

641
00:30:55,232 --> 00:30:59,328
The only thing that's interesting about this entire interview is that Alex Jones

642
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,912
Equipment

643
00:31:03,168 --> 00:31:05,216
He's trying to go to the interview with Ben Garrison

644
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:10,336
Break salt

645
00:31:10,592 --> 00:31:13,920
Even though they're trying to talk whenever Alex

646
00:31:14,176 --> 00:31:14,688
Can't hear any

647
00:31:17,504 --> 00:31:18,784
I don't even press on

648
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:20,320
Blisters and viewer

649
00:31:22,368 --> 00:31:28,000
I've got a broken arm

650
00:31:28,256 --> 00:31:28,768
So

651
00:31:29,024 --> 00:31:30,816
So when he gets another ear

652
00:31:31,072 --> 00:31:33,888
He doesn't need to impress this on the listeners

653
00:31:34,144 --> 00:31:35,680
And then maybe

654
00:31:35,936 --> 00:31:37,216
20 seconds later is like

655
00:31:37,472 --> 00:31:38,752
I'll say to you

656
00:31:39,008 --> 00:31:41,056
And they've just has Ben Garrison

657
00:31:44,384 --> 00:31:45,920
Okay alright

658
00:31:46,176 --> 00:31:47,712
Talking about

659
00:31:47,968 --> 00:31:52,576
Can't respond to it in the middle

660
00:31:53,088 --> 00:31:54,112
Alex

661
00:31:54,368 --> 00:31:59,488
Turn his mic on and you can hear him yelling at the

662
00:32:00,256 --> 00:32:05,120
Mark says a democracy

663
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,704
100 hours of driving

664
00:32:09,984 --> 00:32:12,800
Well this dumbass hole

665
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:17,920
Dumb assholes trying to talk about Karl Marx

666
00:32:18,688 --> 00:32:19,712
It's Brandi

667
00:32:19,968 --> 00:32:20,992
Amateur hour

668
00:32:22,528 --> 00:32:24,576
I'm a big fan of

669
00:32:25,344 --> 00:32:28,928
Everytime it like whenever he's like oh I don't use a teleprompter

670
00:32:30,976 --> 00:32:31,488
Because you're

671
00:32:31,744 --> 00:32:33,280
Broadcaster

672
00:32:33,536 --> 00:32:34,048
You don't

673
00:32:34,304 --> 00:32:35,072
F****** have any

674
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:35,840
Professionalism

675
00:32:36,352 --> 00:32:37,120
Whatsoever

676
00:32:37,376 --> 00:32:37,888
0

677
00:32:38,144 --> 00:32:44,288
Also it's not broadcast on any radio station

678
00:32:44,544 --> 00:32:46,592
Yeah I'll miss episode also

679
00:32:46,848 --> 00:32:49,408
He starts doing a lot of Star Wars talk

680
00:32:50,944 --> 00:32:52,224
But he feels a disturbed

681
00:32:52,992 --> 00:32:58,880
The force nuanced look at

682
00:32:59,136 --> 00:32:59,648
Tastic

683
00:33:00,672 --> 00:33:01,696
Do everybody have

684
00:33:01,952 --> 00:33:04,768
Hopefully it's no good let me tell you something

685
00:33:05,024 --> 00:33:06,560
That looks Skywalker

686
00:33:07,584 --> 00:33:08,096
Interesting

687
00:33:08,864 --> 00:33:15,008
I'm not as excited to see this as of the new Jurassic world movie which is not much

688
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:21,152
Number for dinosaurs

689
00:33:21,408 --> 00:33:22,688
Does doing a lot of like

690
00:33:23,968 --> 00:33:24,480
Kind of stuff

691
00:33:24,992 --> 00:33:30,368
Rather I know something's, it's like when the first attacks

692
00:33:31,648 --> 00:33:33,440
Rebellion

693
00:33:35,232 --> 00:33:39,840
He just started the war detectives

694
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:41,376
Joke

695
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:44,192
You think this is

696
00:33:44,448 --> 00:33:48,544
Hardcore criminals on top with a bunch of

697
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:54,944
Dumb down mindless alone people that are scared and desperate

698
00:34:09,536 --> 00:34:10,304
But I need money

699
00:34:11,584 --> 00:34:12,096
Always

700
00:34:12,608 --> 00:34:15,168
About 27 to talk to Jack

701
00:34:15,424 --> 00:34:15,936
So back

702
00:34:16,448 --> 00:34:17,728
Ben Garrison

703
00:34:17,984 --> 00:34:19,008
I wish it was more

704
00:34:20,288 --> 00:34:22,080
It just revealed to me to Ben Garrison

705
00:34:23,616 --> 00:34:24,640
Bad

706
00:34:25,152 --> 00:34:25,920
That's all I got

707
00:34:26,176 --> 00:34:27,456
28

708
00:34:34,112 --> 00:34:34,624
What else you got

709
00:34:37,952 --> 00:34:39,232
Burke Bradford

710
00:34:39,488 --> 00:34:45,120
No he did that bloom County Kerry Carol

711
00:34:47,424 --> 00:34:50,752
Very true.

712
00:34:51,008 --> 00:34:51,520
I love dub

713
00:34:53,312 --> 00:34:54,080
Boone County is very

714
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:56,128
Have you been reading at a harrow County

715
00:34:56,384 --> 00:34:57,920
It's a great graphic novel

716
00:34:59,456 --> 00:35:00,224
I've Loved ugly

717
00:35:00,992 --> 00:35:01,504
So good

718
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:11,744
Episode of knowledge Pines Dallas was the best

719
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:12,512
So cool

720
00:35:13,024 --> 00:35:13,792
So cool

721
00:35:14,304 --> 00:35:14,816
Flawed

722
00:35:15,328 --> 00:35:16,352
Terrible character

723
00:35:16,608 --> 00:35:18,912
Move on to the 28th

724
00:35:19,168 --> 00:35:20,192
Yes is Wednesday

725
00:35:20,704 --> 00:35:21,984
And Alex has

726
00:35:22,496 --> 00:35:23,776
Some other narratives he's pitching

727
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:25,312
First one is about

728
00:35:25,568 --> 00:35:30,432
Craigslist

729
00:35:30,688 --> 00:35:36,064
Is he descended into a dictatorship because I feel like he's on board

730
00:35:37,344 --> 00:35:38,112
Like this is a

731
00:35:38,368 --> 00:35:38,880
Natural

732
00:35:39,136 --> 00:35:41,952
They're going down very similar to how they have been

733
00:35:42,208 --> 00:35:44,768
A while

734
00:35:45,024 --> 00:35:51,168
Well Percy is kind of edgy

735
00:35:51,424 --> 00:35:51,936
Alex

736
00:35:52,192 --> 00:35:53,472
Complains about China not because he

737
00:35:53,728 --> 00:35:54,240
Who cares about China

738
00:35:55,264 --> 00:35:56,032
Providing cover

739
00:35:56,288 --> 00:35:57,056
What's going on in Russia

740
00:35:57,824 --> 00:35:58,592
It's always like

741
00:35:58,848 --> 00:36:00,128
Everyone says that

742
00:36:00,384 --> 00:36:01,408
I won't touch that poop

743
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:02,688
Dictator

744
00:36:02,944 --> 00:36:03,968
What about the Tricom

745
00:36:04,736 --> 00:36:07,552
It's just his mom pretty sure we're all on board with

746
00:36:07,808 --> 00:36:11,136
Dictators becoming dictators

747
00:36:11,392 --> 00:36:11,904
Both

748
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:12,928
It's not one or the other

749
00:36:13,184 --> 00:36:13,696
Anyway here's

750
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,840
Control

751
00:36:20,096 --> 00:36:21,632
Call the numbers

752
00:36:22,144 --> 00:36:23,168
Everything

753
00:36:23,936 --> 00:36:27,776
I told you about that years ago is finally in the news

754
00:36:36,992 --> 00:36:39,296
They have

755
00:36:44,416 --> 00:36:47,744
Exports to the kingdom

756
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:59,008
No it's not

757
00:37:00,032 --> 00:37:05,408
We talked about this already it sounds like that's what it is in reality what it is is a Google gave the encryption

758
00:37:05,664 --> 00:37:07,200
Some keys to China of chow

759
00:37:07,456 --> 00:37:08,736
Chinese iCloud

760
00:37:08,992 --> 00:37:09,504
Customer now

761
00:37:10,016 --> 00:37:11,296
Let me tell you something

762
00:37:11,552 --> 00:37:12,576
If his listeners

763
00:37:13,088 --> 00:37:14,624
Have seen the movie Elysium

764
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:15,648
I would be

765
00:37:16,672 --> 00:37:19,488
Just by going off box office receipts

766
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:23,328
Not a hugely popular film heard his review

767
00:37:26,144 --> 00:37:28,192
I like it's different all just a lie

768
00:37:28,448 --> 00:37:29,216
Like that's all

769
00:37:29,984 --> 00:37:33,056
Projecting whatever you learn from that movie

770
00:37:33,824 --> 00:37:35,360
Onto his version of reality

771
00:37:35,616 --> 00:37:36,896
Like that encrypt

772
00:37:37,152 --> 00:37:37,920
Monkeys that

773
00:37:38,176 --> 00:37:38,688
They gave two

774
00:37:38,944 --> 00:37:40,224
Vagina

775
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,040
Between local

776
00:37:43,296 --> 00:37:45,600
Company in China

777
00:37:46,112 --> 00:37:52,000
It will

778
00:37:52,512 --> 00:37:53,792
But it's not giving encryption

779
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:55,584
The entire world

780
00:37:56,864 --> 00:38:01,728
The Chinese iCloud customer

781
00:38:01,984 --> 00:38:03,008
Telecom system

782
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:04,288
Russia hat

783
00:38:04,544 --> 00:38:05,056
Interesting

784
00:38:05,312 --> 00:38:07,616
But it's just it's just the way of Alex

785
00:38:10,432 --> 00:38:11,456
Not really giving him

786
00:38:11,712 --> 00:38:12,480
Information for what he does do

787
00:38:12,992 --> 00:38:13,504
Episode

788
00:38:14,272 --> 00:38:15,808
It's some solid whataboutism

789
00:38:19,648 --> 00:38:20,928
Alex Jones

790
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:21,952
We love Bass

791
00:38:22,464 --> 00:38:22,976
That is

792
00:38:23,232 --> 00:38:23,744
Doing impression

793
00:38:43,456 --> 00:38:49,600
Smelling

794
00:38:50,368 --> 00:38:55,488
Cuz he got winded is is his Bernie Sanders also a siren is this

795
00:38:59,072 --> 00:39:04,192
Weird does Bloods come

796
00:39:04,448 --> 00:39:06,240
Is actually a new one

797
00:39:06,496 --> 00:39:07,264
On the 28th of March

798
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:08,288
Chan Wednesday

799
00:39:08,544 --> 00:39:10,592
To do with that

800
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:11,872
Who got in a new narrative

801
00:39:12,128 --> 00:39:16,224
Not really cuz we got the John Paul Stevens narrative

802
00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:19,040
Yeah but

803
00:39:19,296 --> 00:39:21,344
No bad news this one does too

804
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:23,904
But it's a really interesting

805
00:39:24,416 --> 00:39:25,184
Information

806
00:39:25,952 --> 00:39:26,464
On the other side

807
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:27,488
This one

808
00:39:27,744 --> 00:39:30,048
Isabel Isabel

809
00:39:31,584 --> 00:39:32,096
Alright

810
00:39:32,352 --> 00:39:34,400
Muslims and suites.com

811
00:39:37,984 --> 00:39:38,752
For Muslim

812
00:39:42,592 --> 00:39:46,432
Because I guess

813
00:39:53,344 --> 00:39:56,928
Releases brochure for migrants legitimizing child marriage

814
00:39:58,464 --> 00:40:00,000
You just can't make this up

815
00:40:00,512 --> 00:40:02,560
Yes you can so I can

816
00:40:02,816 --> 00:40:04,096
Find this brochure

817
00:40:04,352 --> 00:40:06,656
Because

818
00:40:06,912 --> 00:40:11,776
The only thing I can find on this is article on Infowars written by Paul Joseph Watson

819
00:40:12,032 --> 00:40:13,312
And that they only have

820
00:40:15,104 --> 00:40:15,616
Tweet

821
00:40:15,872 --> 00:40:18,176
From a guy who's talking

822
00:40:18,432 --> 00:40:18,944
Forget about it

823
00:40:20,992 --> 00:40:22,272
We bring you the latest

824
00:40:22,528 --> 00:40:24,576
Tweets from a guy

825
00:40:25,088 --> 00:40:27,392
To be is that the brochure talks about

826
00:40:27,648 --> 00:40:28,672
People who have

827
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:29,952
Married

828
00:40:30,464 --> 00:40:32,768
Underage folks in other countries

829
00:40:34,304 --> 00:40:36,096
That have a record

830
00:40:36,352 --> 00:40:37,376
Acknowledge the marriage

831
00:40:37,888 --> 00:40:40,448
But also recommend that people don't

832
00:40:40,704 --> 00:40:41,472
Adult

833
00:40:41,728 --> 00:40:45,056
Don't live with or marry anyone under the age of 15

834
00:40:45,824 --> 00:40:46,592
That's f***** up

835
00:40:47,872 --> 00:40:50,944
Yeah that's a weird place for Sweden today because

836
00:40:51,456 --> 00:40:52,224
They are

837
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:54,784
Trying so much to understand and respect

838
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:55,552
Everybody

839
00:40:55,808 --> 00:40:57,344
Almost to

840
00:40:58,624 --> 00:40:59,136
It did

841
00:40:59,392 --> 00:41:00,160
2

842
00:41:00,672 --> 00:41:03,232
2A Andover down extend

843
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,792
That of course they're going to be like

844
00:41:06,048 --> 00:41:08,352
We are trying to include everyone

845
00:41:08,608 --> 00:41:09,120
And yes

846
00:41:09,376 --> 00:41:12,448
Culture is weird in that way

847
00:41:12,704 --> 00:41:13,472
But also

848
00:41:13,984 --> 00:41:17,312
Please don't do that what are you going to

849
00:41:17,568 --> 00:41:18,080
To do

850
00:41:18,848 --> 00:41:21,664
If someone was married at a different age

851
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:23,968
Then you deem acceptable in a different country

852
00:41:25,248 --> 00:41:30,112
Say invalid or implication

853
00:41:30,368 --> 00:41:31,904
Like I don't I don't know

854
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:32,672
Statecraft

855
00:41:32,928 --> 00:41:35,232
International

856
00:41:35,744 --> 00:41:37,792
I don't know if you want a broach that subject

857
00:41:38,304 --> 00:41:40,608
Because if you are doing that

858
00:41:40,864 --> 00:41:43,680
What you would like if you do say if you come to this

859
00:41:44,192 --> 00:41:45,984
Validate

860
00:41:47,008 --> 00:41:48,544
What you have done in your other

861
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:51,872
Country that is another way of saying you're not allowed to come

862
00:41:52,384 --> 00:41:53,151
I do think

863
00:41:53,407 --> 00:41:55,711
Marrying people who are minors

864
00:41:56,223 --> 00:41:56,735
Is wrong

865
00:41:56,991 --> 00:41:58,783
Super Wrong by Ted Nugent did it

866
00:42:00,831 --> 00:42:01,343
So that's fun

867
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:04,671
Right on Ted Nugent married a girl who is 17

868
00:42:04,927 --> 00:42:06,463
In order for her parents not

869
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:07,743
Complained when he

870
00:42:08,767 --> 00:42:12,607
I have sex with her marry her

871
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:16,191
He adopted her yeah that's one of the weirdest things not married

872
00:42:16,703 --> 00:42:17,983
Also Courtney Love's husband

873
00:42:18,495 --> 00:42:19,007
She blew in one

874
00:42:19,519 --> 00:42:20,287
12

875
00:42:20,543 --> 00:42:23,615
So also spoiler alert

876
00:42:23,871 --> 00:42:24,639
On Thursday

877
00:42:26,687 --> 00:42:32,831
The moral High Ground

878
00:42:33,087 --> 00:42:39,231
Many of these people who have committed so many sex crimes often take the moral High Ground to appear as

879
00:42:39,487 --> 00:42:45,631
Pundits on Alex Jones Show where they talk about Muslims want to have sex with your kids

880
00:42:45,887 --> 00:42:47,935
They're starting to appear on CNN

881
00:42:48,191 --> 00:42:54,335
Not really good point I regret that I don't remember who it was and I can't pull it up now but on the Facebook

882
00:42:54,591 --> 00:42:56,127
Ted

883
00:42:57,407 --> 00:42:57,919
The right

884
00:42:58,175 --> 00:42:58,687
Is buying into the

885
00:42:58,943 --> 00:42:59,455
Mythology

886
00:42:59,967 --> 00:43:00,479
Ignoring

887
00:43:00,991 --> 00:43:01,759
Reality Fugazi

888
00:43:02,015 --> 00:43:04,831
I can't imagine the right ever doing anything

889
00:43:05,087 --> 00:43:05,599
Did the draft

890
00:43:05,855 --> 00:43:06,623
Austin Banks kids

891
00:43:06,879 --> 00:43:11,487
Who would never accept somebody like that

892
00:43:11,743 --> 00:43:16,351
They would never elect multiple people like that as president so no back back to the Sweden

893
00:43:18,143 --> 00:43:19,423
I want to ask you if you know about this

894
00:43:20,191 --> 00:43:20,703
You know

895
00:43:20,959 --> 00:43:21,727
The girls as young as

896
00:43:21,983 --> 00:43:23,775
Quail can be married in Uruguay

897
00:43:24,031 --> 00:43:25,311
14 in Venezuela

898
00:43:25,567 --> 00:43:27,615
14 in Belarus 14 and Bolivia

899
00:43:27,871 --> 00:43:28,895
12 in Columbia

900
00:43:29,151 --> 00:43:29,663
14 in

901
00:43:29,919 --> 00:43:34,783
Cuba 12 in Ecuador 14 in El Salvador Guatemala 15 and Lithuania

902
00:43:35,039 --> 00:43:39,647
14 in Mexico 14 in Nicaragua 14 and Panama 14 and Tanzania

903
00:43:39,903 --> 00:43:41,695
12 in Trinidad and Tobago

904
00:43:41,951 --> 00:43:43,487
None of these are Muslim countries

905
00:43:43,743 --> 00:43:44,511
These are just

906
00:43:44,767 --> 00:43:47,071
Countries that have different cultural

907
00:43:47,327 --> 00:43:48,863
Values

908
00:43:49,375 --> 00:43:55,519
I think there's developmental problems that exist there but yeah when you play

909
00:43:55,775 --> 00:43:59,103
Play the game that Alex is playing any Trice presented as a Muslim issue

910
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:00,639
King of child breiding

911
00:44:01,663 --> 00:44:03,455
What if someone immigrate to

912
00:44:04,735 --> 00:44:06,015
Sweden from Colombia

913
00:44:06,271 --> 00:44:09,599
Yeah they married someone who was 12 right

914
00:44:10,623 --> 00:44:14,463
That is a high priority male female

915
00:44:14,719 --> 00:44:17,279
That's more to the point

916
00:44:18,303 --> 00:44:21,119
As I've said before

917
00:44:22,143 --> 00:44:22,911
It dude

918
00:44:23,423 --> 00:44:27,263
It's not religion it's not all of this other s*** it's

919
00:44:27,775 --> 00:44:28,799
Dude it's men

920
00:44:29,055 --> 00:44:30,335
Anytime you have a

921
00:44:30,591 --> 00:44:31,615
The patriarchal system

922
00:44:33,663 --> 00:44:36,223
Scapegoats Muslims for a threat

923
00:44:36,479 --> 00:44:38,271
Decides

924
00:44:38,783 --> 00:44:42,623
Men like to talk to you about this also in the United States

925
00:44:42,879 --> 00:44:43,647
Spy quote

926
00:44:43,903 --> 00:44:45,439
Most states allow marriages at 6

927
00:44:45,695 --> 00:44:46,975
16 and 17 with parental

928
00:44:47,743 --> 00:44:48,767
In some states also make

929
00:44:49,023 --> 00:44:49,791
Exception subject

930
00:44:50,047 --> 00:44:50,815
Judicial provement

931
00:44:51,327 --> 00:44:52,351
Or cases

932
00:44:52,607 --> 00:44:53,119
The pregnancy

933
00:44:53,375 --> 00:44:54,143
When all except

934
00:44:54,399 --> 00:44:55,423
Taking into account

935
00:44:55,679 --> 00:44:56,703
25 United

936
00:44:56,959 --> 00:44:59,519
What states have no minimum age requirement

937
00:45:00,799 --> 00:45:01,823
Not okay

938
00:45:02,079 --> 00:45:02,847
In Florida

939
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:03,871
Thousand

940
00:45:04,127 --> 00:45:05,919
400 children some as young as

941
00:45:06,175 --> 00:45:06,687
613

942
00:45:06,943 --> 00:45:07,967
Have been married since

943
00:45:08,223 --> 00:45:08,735
2000

944
00:45:08,991 --> 00:45:10,527
Which is the second highest incidence

945
00:45:10,783 --> 00:45:11,551
Child marriage

946
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:12,831
Texas

947
00:45:13,087 --> 00:45:16,159
Well not just that but it's also one of those things

948
00:45:16,415 --> 00:45:17,439
Where many

949
00:45:17,695 --> 00:45:18,719
Of these cultures

950
00:45:19,231 --> 00:45:19,743
Groom

951
00:45:19,999 --> 00:45:21,023
Children

952
00:45:21,279 --> 00:45:23,839
Is nose

953
00:45:24,863 --> 00:45:26,143
There is still like

954
00:45:26,399 --> 00:45:27,167
You're 12

955
00:45:27,423 --> 00:45:28,447

965
00:45:50,207 --> 00:45:53,023
Like Everyone likes to point the finger at like I had a buddy

966
00:45:53,279 --> 00:45:55,071
When I was growing up

967
00:45:55,327 --> 00:45:55,839
Indians

968
00:45:56,095 --> 00:45:56,607
I guess his parents

969
00:45:56,863 --> 00:45:57,375

972
00:46:00,959 --> 00:46:01,983
Is good dude

973
00:46:02,239 --> 00:46:04,031
And his parents were very insistent

974
00:46:04,287 --> 00:46:05,055
The he want they wanted

975
00:46:05,311 --> 00:46:07,103
To arrange Merit right

976
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:08,895
Debuck's back against the

977
00:46:10,175 --> 00:46:10,687
You for them

978
00:46:12,735 --> 00:46:13,503
Someone

979
00:46:13,759 --> 00:46:15,807
Choice

980
00:46:16,063 --> 00:46:17,599
Weird

981
00:46:17,855 --> 00:46:18,623
And everything is fine

982
00:46:18,879 --> 00:46:21,439
Everything's going to actually had the marriage

983
00:46:21,695 --> 00:46:23,231
In India

984
00:46:23,487 --> 00:46:25,279
But there are cases like that that

985
00:46:26,047 --> 00:46:28,607
Well recently recently in the news

986
00:46:28,863 --> 00:46:29,631
Somebody who

987
00:46:30,143 --> 00:46:33,983
It was a woman

988
00:46:34,239 --> 00:46:39,103
It was a young woman who rejected her parents arranged marriage and they threw hot oil

989
00:46:39,615 --> 00:46:42,431
And they abused her in so many different ways

990
00:46:44,735 --> 00:46:46,783
That is the actions of

991
00:46:47,039 --> 00:46:47,807
Insane people

992
00:46:48,063 --> 00:46:48,831
That's why it's

993
00:46:49,087 --> 00:46:55,231
It's new it's not the actions of the religion as a whole or the people as a whole

994
00:46:56,511 --> 00:46:58,559
Most of the people in that culture would be like

995
00:46:58,815 --> 00:47:02,399
Hey we get that arranged marriage is part of our culture

996
00:47:02,655 --> 00:47:04,191
Still f***** up

997
00:47:05,471 --> 00:47:07,007
Episode Alex

998
00:47:07,263 --> 00:47:09,311
Give a Gaston who wants to talk

999
00:47:09,567 --> 00:47:10,079
Turnabout

1000
00:47:11,871 --> 00:47:12,895
Muslims

1001
00:47:13,407 --> 00:47:13,919
Too much of it

1002
00:47:14,431 --> 00:47:18,271
Enneagram

1003
00:47:19,295 --> 00:47:21,343
Into what the Quran

1004
00:47:22,623 --> 00:47:25,183
But if you look at the what the Quran says

1005
00:47:27,487 --> 00:47:28,511
Islamic law

1006
00:47:29,279 --> 00:47:29,791
They don't

1007
00:47:30,047 --> 00:47:30,559
Support that

1008
00:47:31,327 --> 00:47:33,887
It's not that the Orthodox Islam does

1009
00:47:35,167 --> 00:47:36,959
There is a verse about circumcision

1010
00:47:38,495 --> 00:47:39,775
Very specific about how you

1011
00:47:40,031 --> 00:47:40,799
You should not do harm

1012
00:47:41,823 --> 00:47:45,919
Further because

1013
00:47:46,687 --> 00:47:47,967
I need to drive home

1014
00:47:48,223 --> 00:47:48,735
The point

1015
00:47:49,247 --> 00:47:50,527
You really acted like

1016
00:47:50,783 --> 00:47:51,295
Like I was about to

1017
00:47:52,063 --> 00:47:54,623
No I just want to drive home that point

1018
00:47:55,903 --> 00:47:56,671
18000

1019
00:47:56,927 --> 00:47:57,951
400 children

1020
00:47:58,463 --> 00:47:59,231
Florida

1021
00:47:59,999 --> 00:48:01,023
Since 2000

1022
00:48:01,279 --> 00:48:02,047
Have been married

1023
00:48:02,815 --> 00:48:03,327
Is the second

1024
00:48:03,583 --> 00:48:04,607
Highest incidence

1025
00:48:05,375 --> 00:48:05,887
The highest

1026
00:48:06,399 --> 00:48:06,911
Is

1027
00:48:07,167 --> 00:48:07,935
Texas

1028
00:48:08,447 --> 00:48:09,983
You know what's weird

1029
00:48:10,239 --> 00:48:11,007
You know what's weird

1030
00:48:11,519 --> 00:48:12,799
That seems low to me

1031
00:48:13,055 --> 00:48:14,079
Those people are

1032
00:48:14,335 --> 00:48:14,847
F***** up

1033
00:48:15,103 --> 00:48:16,127
The data shows that

1034
00:48:16,383 --> 00:48:17,663
Girl

1035
00:48:17,919 --> 00:48:18,431
15 or younger

1036
00:48:18,687 --> 00:48:20,223
Who cannot legally consent to sex

1037
00:48:20,479 --> 00:48:21,503
In Florida

1038
00:48:21,759 --> 00:48:22,271
Or had a baby

1039
00:48:22,527 --> 00:48:23,551
And then married an adult man

1040
00:48:24,063 --> 00:48:25,087
In each of these incidents

1041
00:48:25,343 --> 00:48:26,111
Because the girls rapist

1042
00:48:26,879 --> 00:48:28,415
Marriage license

1043
00:48:28,671 --> 00:48:29,183
Going to prison

1044
00:48:29,951 --> 00:48:30,719
In most cases

1045
00:48:30,975 --> 00:48:31,999
The exploitative practices

1046
00:48:32,511 --> 00:48:34,047
Takes place inside families or hitting

1047
00:48:34,303 --> 00:48:34,815
From public View

1048
00:48:35,327 --> 00:48:38,655
If you Brave women have spoken out about being pushed into marriages

1049
00:48:38,911 --> 00:48:40,447
His children have shared horror stories

1050
00:48:40,959 --> 00:48:42,239
Notably Sherry Johnson

1051
00:48:42,495 --> 00:48:43,263
From Tampa

1052
00:48:43,519 --> 00:48:44,031
Teletubby

1053
00:48:44,287 --> 00:48:46,079
Pushed married her rapist by her parents

1054
00:48:46,591 --> 00:48:48,639
She was only 11 years old and then being trapped

1055
00:48:48,895 --> 00:48:49,919
Abusive marriage for men

1056
00:48:51,455 --> 00:48:53,503
Their situations like this and has nothing to

1057
00:48:53,759 --> 00:48:56,575
To do almond has nothing to do with religion is nothing to do with the culture

1058
00:48:56,831 --> 00:48:58,367
It has everything to do with the idea of

1059
00:48:59,391 --> 00:48:59,903
Not

1060
00:49:00,415 --> 00:49:05,023
Bringing shame to the family and that's not a Muslim idea that's just people ID

1061
00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:09,119
That idea of looking at your children

1062
00:49:09,375 --> 00:49:12,703
An extension of yourself

1063
00:49:12,959 --> 00:49:18,079
Laws allow for a man to rape a woman

1064
00:49:18,335 --> 00:49:19,103
And if she get pregnant

1065
00:49:19,871 --> 00:49:20,639
He is given

1066
00:49:20,895 --> 00:49:21,407
Custody

1067
00:49:21,919 --> 00:49:24,735
He is given visitation

1068
00:49:24,991 --> 00:49:26,527
That's crazy

1069
00:49:26,783 --> 00:49:28,319
You're forced to now have

1070
00:49:28,575 --> 00:49:29,343
The rapist

1071
00:49:30,111 --> 00:49:31,135
Who owns

1072
00:49:32,415 --> 00:49:32,927
F******

1073
00:49:33,183 --> 00:49:35,231
Destroyed your you're

1074
00:49:35,487 --> 00:49:35,999
Life

1075
00:49:36,255 --> 00:49:39,071
Regardless of whether or not you can rebuild it

1076
00:49:39,327 --> 00:49:40,607
He destroyed everything

1077
00:49:40,863 --> 00:49:42,911
And he is now a part of your life

1078
00:49:43,167 --> 00:49:43,679
Ever

1079
00:49:45,727 --> 00:49:46,751
So

1080
00:49:49,055 --> 00:49:50,847
Alex also has an interview with

1081
00:49:52,383 --> 00:49:55,967
Arranged marriage

1082
00:49:56,223 --> 00:49:57,247
Is 18

1083
00:49:57,503 --> 00:49:59,039
And she talks about the

1084
00:49:59,295 --> 00:50:00,319
Female genital mutilation

1085
00:50:00,831 --> 00:50:04,415
Like in terms of that

1086
00:50:04,671 --> 00:50:05,183
Lucifer campaign

1087
00:50:06,975 --> 00:50:07,487
I do support

1088
00:50:09,279 --> 00:50:09,791
She is

1089
00:50:10,559 --> 00:50:11,071
From the United

1090
00:50:11,583 --> 00:50:12,607
When is working with Tony Robbins

1091
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:13,631
That's not good

1092
00:50:14,655 --> 00:50:15,167
Appears that

1093
00:50:15,423 --> 00:50:16,703
There is more going

1094
00:50:17,983 --> 00:50:20,799
You know what's weird is that

1095
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:25,663
5ive started

1096
00:50:25,919 --> 00:50:28,223
Yeah just as long as gloss dollar

1097
00:50:28,479 --> 00:50:31,295
Dr. Abbott

1098
00:50:31,551 --> 00:50:32,575
Aslan out

1099
00:50:33,855 --> 00:50:36,415
Northstar

1100
00:50:36,671 --> 00:50:38,463
The person the life and bodily sounds

1101
00:50:38,719 --> 00:50:39,231
The person

1102
00:50:39,487 --> 00:50:40,255
Is a legal necessity

1103
00:50:40,767 --> 00:50:41,791
Anything that compromises

1104
00:50:42,047 --> 00:50:43,071
Is it legal necessity by Brick

1105
00:50:43,327 --> 00:50:44,607
Harm to a person is unlawful

1106
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:45,887
This is an interpretation

1107
00:50:46,655 --> 00:50:47,679
The prophet Muhammad said

1108
00:50:48,191 --> 00:50:49,983
And I quote trim but do not cut into it

1109
00:50:50,495 --> 00:50:52,799
But is brighter for the face and more favorable

1110
00:50:53,055 --> 00:50:53,567
For the husband

1111
00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:56,127
Which is still misogynistic

1112
00:50:57,151 --> 00:50:59,455
No I don't like it either but also

1113
00:51:00,479 --> 00:51:01,503
I don't like

1114
00:51:01,759 --> 00:51:06,623
I just don't like computer

1115
00:51:06,879 --> 00:51:13,023
Religious bulshit law

1116
00:51:13,279 --> 00:51:14,047
In The Raw

1117
00:51:14,303 --> 00:51:15,071
Just

1118
00:51:15,327 --> 00:51:16,607
Wiring somebody

1119
00:51:16,863 --> 00:51:18,911
Constantly

1120
00:51:20,191 --> 00:51:22,239
Accurately be wrong

1121
00:51:23,263 --> 00:51:24,031
Let's move on

1122
00:51:24,287 --> 00:51:29,407
Anyways organized religion

1123
00:51:29,663 --> 00:51:30,943
Today that Alex Jones is wrong

1124
00:51:31,199 --> 00:51:32,223
Child marriage happens

1125
00:51:32,479 --> 00:51:34,783
Under his very nose in Texas

1126
00:51:35,039 --> 00:51:36,831
In white families all over the place

1127
00:51:37,343 --> 00:51:38,623
It is an issue that has to do

1128
00:51:38,879 --> 00:51:39,391
With

1129
00:51:39,647 --> 00:51:41,439
Patriarchal

1130
00:51:41,695 --> 00:51:42,975
Do do

1131
00:51:43,231 --> 00:51:44,511
Jerry Krause

1132
00:51:45,023 --> 00:51:46,559
Are guilty of it too

1133
00:51:46,815 --> 00:51:48,095
Hey tonight it's not just

1134
00:51:48,351 --> 00:51:49,631
And maybe there respond

1135
00:51:49,887 --> 00:51:50,399
Going to

1136
00:51:50,655 --> 00:51:54,751
Pressure from their husband

1137
00:51:55,263 --> 00:51:57,055
I don't know if it's fair to say that it's

1138
00:51:59,359 --> 00:52:01,151
It is

1139
00:52:02,175 --> 00:52:07,295
A traceable historically from the mail

1140
00:52:09,087 --> 00:52:09,599
Purity

1141
00:52:09,855 --> 00:52:14,975
Yeah that sort of idea

1142
00:52:15,231 --> 00:52:15,999
Diabetic snacks

1143
00:52:16,255 --> 00:52:17,279
The current manifestation

1144
00:52:17,791 --> 00:52:18,815
You could find

1145
00:52:20,095 --> 00:52:23,423
Like let's say a single mom household where she behaves this

1146
00:52:23,679 --> 00:52:25,983
This way towards her daughter without a mail-in

1147
00:52:26,495 --> 00:52:29,311
I think it's possible but I do agree with you story

1148
00:52:29,567 --> 00:52:30,079
Anyway

1149
00:52:30,335 --> 00:52:30,847
Who cares

1150
00:52:31,103 --> 00:52:33,151
I would I want to talk to you about is how I grow out

1151
00:52:33,407 --> 00:52:33,919
Alex is getting on this

1152
00:52:34,175 --> 00:52:35,199
Episode he's getting

1153
00:52:35,455 --> 00:52:36,223
F****** Fury

1154
00:52:36,991 --> 00:52:37,759
Here's the first clip

1155
00:52:38,271 --> 00:52:39,039
Really

1156
00:52:39,295 --> 00:52:40,063
Really messed up

1157
00:52:40,575 --> 00:52:42,879
Amazing silver products

1158
00:52:49,535 --> 00:52:55,679
America's wealth

1159
00:53:04,383 --> 00:53:05,151
So that's the first one

1160
00:53:05,663 --> 00:53:08,991
That's a hard way to get out of it

1161
00:53:09,503 --> 00:53:15,647
That's it that's one of the weirder add pivots in generally speaking we get the screaming about nonsense

1162
00:53:15,903 --> 00:53:19,999
So loudly and then the ad paper

1163
00:53:20,255 --> 00:53:22,047
Turning into screaming about.

1164
00:53:22,303 --> 00:53:24,095
Yeah it's kind of

1165
00:53:27,167 --> 00:53:27,679
F****** mood

1166
00:53:27,935 --> 00:53:29,471
Here's here's my question

1167
00:53:29,983 --> 00:53:33,567
You only you have a

1168
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:37,151
Point of view that derail

1169
00:53:37,407 --> 00:53:39,967
The situation I think this one actually is

1170
00:53:42,783 --> 00:53:43,807
We have

1171
00:53:44,575 --> 00:53:45,087
If not

1172
00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:46,623
Conclusively proven

1173
00:53:46,879 --> 00:53:49,439
Proven to a

1174
00:53:49,951 --> 00:53:50,719
Very solid

1175
00:53:51,487 --> 00:53:53,023
That the larger portion of

1176
00:53:53,279 --> 00:53:53,791
Responding

1177
00:53:54,047 --> 00:53:55,071
Has to come from

1178
00:53:56,095 --> 00:53:57,119
Dark money not his

1179
00:53:57,631 --> 00:53:58,399
Listeners

1180
00:53:58,911 --> 00:54:01,983
Listeners that only listen to him online

1181
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:04,543
I think that's entirely possible

1182
00:54:04,799 --> 00:54:05,567
Why

1183
00:54:05,823 --> 00:54:09,151
What was were referencing back to the idea that he's not on any radio station

1184
00:54:09,407 --> 00:54:15,551
Yeah proper YouTube channel

1185
00:54:15,807 --> 00:54:16,575
What you'll see

1186
00:54:16,831 --> 00:54:19,135
In terms of like his actual long

1187
00:54:19,391 --> 00:54:19,903
Inform shows

1188
00:54:20,159 --> 00:54:22,463
Those are posted on the real Alex Jones Channel

1189
00:54:25,023 --> 00:54:27,583
Clearly

1190
00:54:27,839 --> 00:54:30,399
Natural and that post all of the long-form videos

1191
00:54:30,655 --> 00:54:31,423
Like

1192
00:54:31,679 --> 00:54:32,191
Maybe

1193
00:54:32,959 --> 00:54:33,983
Maybe 10,000

1194
00:54:34,239 --> 00:54:35,263
20000 people

1195
00:54:35,519 --> 00:54:37,055
Watch the actual show

1196
00:54:37,311 --> 00:54:38,847
Now the numbers that Alex gets for his

1197
00:54:39,103 --> 00:54:40,895
3 minute Clips are higher

1198
00:54:41,151 --> 00:54:43,967
Have you might have like 50,000 people who are watching

1199
00:54:44,735 --> 00:54:45,503
These clips

1200
00:54:46,271 --> 00:54:49,855
Maybe 100,000 if it's something like really salacious

1201
00:54:50,111 --> 00:54:52,159
That doesn't add up

1202
00:54:52,415 --> 00:54:58,559
To the millions of dollars in gas to run the operation so is he aggressive

1203
00:54:59,071 --> 00:54:59,583
Covertech

1204
00:55:00,095 --> 00:55:00,863
Or is it

1205
00:55:01,375 --> 00:55:04,191
Because it's not I can't figure that out

1206
00:55:04,447 --> 00:55:08,031
Possible for him to obtain the amount of money he has

1207
00:55:08,543 --> 00:55:10,591
With the listenership for the viewership

1208
00:55:10,847 --> 00:55:13,663
That we see

1209
00:55:13,919 --> 00:55:14,431
So

1210
00:55:14,687 --> 00:55:17,503
Like

1211
00:55:18,015 --> 00:55:20,319
Yeah I think it is getting money from somebody

1212
00:55:20,575 --> 00:55:22,111
To bolster the operation

1213
00:55:22,367 --> 00:55:23,647
Yeah I don't know who that is

1214
00:55:23,903 --> 00:55:24,671
Probably the mercy

1215
00:55:25,183 --> 00:55:27,487
That's an attractive option the Koch brothers in

1216
00:55:27,743 --> 00:55:33,887
In the pasture very attractive option is Sheldon Adelson is interactive option

But I am

1224
00:55:47,711 --> 00:55:49,247
Based on

1225
00:55:49,503 --> 00:55:50,015
Kid needs to pee

1226
00:55:50,271 --> 00:55:51,039
Hey to make of this

1227
00:55:51,295 --> 00:55:52,831
Happen

1228
00:55:53,087 --> 00:55:55,903
He must be paying on that studio space

1229
00:55:56,159 --> 00:55:56,671
Sound

1230
00:55:56,927 --> 00:55:57,439
Figured out

1231
00:55:57,695 --> 00:55:58,463
Roundabout

1232
00:55:58,719 --> 00:55:59,231
He's paying in rent

1233
00:55:59,743 --> 00:56:00,511
There's no way he

1234
00:56:00,767 --> 00:56:01,791
He's doing it with the audience

1235
00:56:02,303 --> 00:56:02,815
He has

1236
00:56:04,607 --> 00:56:07,935
So why is it then that he is so

1237
00:56:08,447 --> 00:56:13,567
Aggressive

1238
00:56:16,895 --> 00:56:18,431
It's possible that he hasn't allowed

1239
00:56:19,199 --> 00:56:19,711
Or whatever

1240
00:56:19,967 --> 00:56:21,247
From whoever's bolster

1241
00:56:21,759 --> 00:56:23,039
Okay

1242
00:56:23,551 --> 00:56:24,575
The money that comes in

Yeah or whatever

1245
00:56:28,927 --> 00:56:29,439
Yeah

1246
00:56:29,695 --> 00:56:32,255
If you're accustomed to a certain lifestyle

1247
00:56:32,511 --> 00:56:33,023
Woodshed

1248
00:56:33,535 --> 00:56:34,303
And you're like

Six Flags money

1255
00:56:47,103 --> 00:56:49,919
What I'm guessing that's the best way I can sort of

1256
00:56:50,175 --> 00:56:52,991
Contextualize it

1257
00:56:54,271 --> 00:56:57,343
What VR mathematically impossible for it not

1258
00:56:57,855 --> 00:57:00,415
It's just what the facts on the ground bleeding

1259
00:57:01,695 --> 00:57:02,719
I'm I'm looking

Dentist office

1261
00:57:03,743 --> 00:57:06,047
Hopefully we'll be able to figure some of this

1262
00:57:07,071 --> 00:57:07,583
Because of

1263
00:57:07,839 --> 00:57:08,863
Ways that

1264
00:57:09,119 --> 00:57:09,631

They don't have to report who they

1268
00:57:14,495 --> 00:57:17,055
Give money to and s*** like that so

1269
00:57:17,311 --> 00:57:18,847
Yeah

1270
00:57:19,359 --> 00:57:19,871
But

1271
00:57:23,199 --> 00:57:24,479
Absolutely

1272
00:57:24,991 --> 00:57:27,295
Fantastic thing that happened to Arkham

1273
00:57:27,551 --> 00:57:28,831

Empty zombie

1276
00:57:39,583 --> 00:57:41,119

1279
00:57:49,055 --> 00:57:49,567
Alright

1280
00:57:50,335 --> 00:57:51,359
Cool cool cool that's

1281
00:57:51,615 --> 00:57:52,383
Violent at all

1282
00:57:52,639 --> 00:57:54,175
Don't think a zombie once brain

1283
00:57:54,431 --> 00:57:54,943
Because they don't have

1284
00:57:56,735 --> 00:58:00,575
Baby

1285
00:58:01,087 --> 00:58:02,367
Hunches

1286
00:58:02,623 --> 00:58:04,159
Because we don't have our own

1287
00:58:04,415 --> 00:58:05,951
You know I have good huh

1288
00:58:06,719 --> 00:58:07,743
Yeah but I would eat them

1289
00:58:08,255 --> 00:58:10,559
I still have them I mean it's all just horse

1290
00:58:12,607 --> 00:58:14,911
It solves violent rhetoric

1291
00:58:15,167 --> 00:58:17,215
The average leftist is the anime

1292
00:58:18,239 --> 00:58:19,007
The average

1293
00:58:19,263 --> 00:58:25,151
Whenever high-level whenever we talked about

1294
00:58:25,407 --> 00:58:26,175
The enemy

1295
00:58:26,431 --> 00:58:27,455
It is not

1296
00:58:27,967 --> 00:58:28,479
Average

1297
00:58:28,735 --> 00:58:30,783
Person the average person is

1298
00:58:31,295 --> 00:58:32,063
Usually

1299
00:58:32,575 --> 00:58:34,111
At the end of the day like a good

1300
00:58:34,367 --> 00:58:36,927
I do way out of my way to make that clear

1301
00:58:37,183 --> 00:58:40,511
Yeah the average conservative is just

1302
00:58:41,791 --> 00:58:42,559
You do

1303
00:58:42,815 --> 00:58:43,839
Easily influenced

1304
00:58:44,095 --> 00:58:44,607
Send an

1305
00:58:44,863 --> 00:58:51,007
Kind of dumb usually wealthy usually realize how far the mainstream

1306
00:58:51,263 --> 00:58:52,031
The right has gone

1307
00:58:52,287 --> 00:58:53,567
Right towards this

1308
00:58:53,823 --> 00:58:57,151

Billionaire

1312
00:59:05,343 --> 00:59:06,367
This is violent issue

1313
00:59:15,071 --> 00:59:17,375
I didn't get pushed around

00:59:56,031 --> 00:59:56,799
You garbage

1323
01:00:12,671 --> 01:00:13,439
Is

1324
01:00:13,695 --> 01:00:14,463
The most

1325
01:00:14,719 --> 01:00:15,743
Progressive projection

1326
01:00:16,255 --> 01:00:20,863
I've ever heard I mean I don't know how else to describe it

1327
01:00:22,399 --> 01:00:25,215
Talking by yourself

1328
01:00:25,471 --> 01:00:26,495
Dealing with the fact that

1329
01:00:27,263 --> 01:00:31,359
Kill yourself a little bit

1330
01:00:31,615 --> 01:00:34,431
The other day like a week and a half ago I wish I had the Clipper this season

1331
01:00:34,687 --> 01:00:36,223
I'm miserable

1332
01:00:36,479 --> 01:00:38,271
All I got is my kids have this fight

1333
01:00:38,527 --> 01:00:39,295
Vistaprint

1334
01:00:39,551 --> 01:00:41,855
This supports every argument we've made about his

1335
01:00:42,111 --> 01:00:43,647
Is transition the overtime

1336
01:00:43,903 --> 01:00:50,047
This is not this is this is Aaron Stone that he could go back to the highwomen

1337
01:00:50,815 --> 01:00:51,583
This is

1338
01:00:54,911 --> 01:00:55,423
God

1339
01:00:56,191 --> 01:01:02,335
I don't think I'm a good person I think I might be evil if tomorrow when I'm listening to the show

1340
01:01:03,103 --> 01:01:05,151
He comes in from break with Eddie Money

1341
01:01:05,663 --> 01:01:11,551
I wanna go back yet

1342
01:01:13,087 --> 01:01:14,879
If he comes back then don't know

1343
01:01:17,695 --> 01:01:19,231
Already telling enough if he comes back

1344
01:01:19,487 --> 01:01:20,255
A break with Tarzan

1345
01:01:20,511 --> 01:01:25,631
Oh no

1346
01:01:25,887 --> 01:01:26,911

28th episode

1349
01:01:30,751 --> 01:01:32,799
What is a Note 3

1350
01:01:33,055 --> 01:01:34,335
Remember boring as hell this one

1351
01:01:34,847 --> 01:01:36,127
Debbie and Nebraska

1352
01:01:36,383 --> 01:01:36,895
Call Zan

1353
01:01:37,151 --> 01:01:43,295
I feel like we heard from Debbie I'm not sure I'm really on the other

1354
01:01:43,551 --> 01:01:45,599
Radar for the guy with the house phone

1355
01:01:45,855 --> 01:01:46,623
In Wyoming

1356
01:01:47,135 --> 01:01:49,439
I only know his voice for sewer

1357
01:01:50,463 --> 01:01:52,511
Debbie and Nebraska make

1358
01:01:52,767 --> 01:01:53,279
Really

1359
01:01:53,535 --> 01:01:54,047
You f***** up

1360
01:01:54,559 --> 01:01:55,839
About women

1361
01:01:56,095 --> 01:01:56,607
Carry guns

1362
01:01:56,863 --> 01:01:57,375
Here's the first

1363
01:01:58,399 --> 01:02:02,495
I mean I have one conversation with the woman and she was just curious

1364
01:02:03,007 --> 01:02:05,055
She said well why don't you conceal that

1365
01:02:05,311 --> 01:02:06,591
Why don't you have it under your coat

1366
01:02:07,103 --> 01:02:08,895
And I said well let me ask you this

1367
01:02:09,407 --> 01:02:12,479
I said if you and I were to walk out in the parking lot right now

1368
01:02:12,735 --> 01:02:17,599
And there was a psycho nut job in the parking lot that was looking for a woman to kidnap and rape

1369
01:02:17,855 --> 01:02:20,415
Who do you think he's going to pick

1370
01:02:21,183 --> 01:02:22,975
And there was this long hot

1371
01:02:23,743 --> 01:02:25,791
And you could almost hear the click in her brain

1372
01:02:26,303 --> 01:02:29,887
And she said well it's not going to be you and I said exactly

1373
01:02:30,399 --> 01:02:33,215
I only need to be a harder Target than one other person

1374
01:02:33,471 --> 01:02:38,591
I was actually kind of on board until the end

1375
01:02:38,847 --> 01:02:41,919
That's so f***** up I was like maybe if women all

1376
01:02:42,175 --> 01:02:48,319
Carry guns and we would have a whole different

1377
01:02:48,575 --> 01:02:52,415
Picking on the tail end of all of the violence right

1378
01:02:52,671 --> 01:02:56,255
Maybe that's a different story and then she ends it with that old like

1379
01:02:56,511 --> 01:03:02,655
I only have to outrun the person that's next to me while we're being chased by a gazelle

1380
01:03:02,911 --> 01:03:09,055
Exactly cuz you don't have a gun

1381
01:03:09,567 --> 01:03:10,335
I don't understand

1382
01:03:10,847 --> 01:03:12,895
Like I'm not judging her too harshly but

1383
01:03:13,151 --> 01:03:15,711
Lionism

1384
01:03:16,479 --> 01:03:19,039
I have a gun so I can protect you two

1385
01:03:19,295 --> 01:03:22,111
Seem like she's interested in whether or not her friend lives

1386
01:03:22,367 --> 01:03:23,647
It seems like it

1387
01:03:24,159 --> 01:03:29,279
It's the same argument that she isn't means baby doesn't

1388
01:03:29,535 --> 01:03:30,303
Give a f*** maybe she doesn't

1389
01:03:30,559 --> 01:03:33,631
Give a f***

1390
01:03:34,143 --> 01:03:35,935
Is that Alex pivot

1391
01:03:37,215 --> 01:03:40,031
Time. Does this maybe she's more like a like a

1392
01:03:40,287 --> 01:03:40,799
Jesus care

1393
01:03:42,079 --> 01:03:43,359
Teacher woman to murder

1394
01:03:44,383 --> 01:03:45,663
It'll murder Waters

1395
01:03:46,175 --> 01:03:48,479
No no murder weapon

1396
01:03:48,991 --> 01:03:49,503
Chicken burger Aldi

1397
01:03:50,015 --> 01:03:51,807
Hey go but Alex

1398
01:03:52,063 --> 01:03:52,575
F******

1399
01:03:53,087 --> 01:03:53,599
Hornet

1400
01:03:53,855 --> 01:03:55,135
He gets hard as s***

1401
01:03:55,391 --> 01:03:57,695
I don't like that it's called here's what ends up happening

1402
01:03:58,463 --> 01:04:02,303
I am talk to one girl she came up to me and she goes well I have a restraining order

1403
01:04:02,815 --> 01:04:03,583
I'm like baby.

1404
01:04:03,839 --> 01:04:06,655
That's just his paper it is not going to stop a gun or knife

1405
01:04:07,167 --> 01:04:12,543
You need to get a gun I said you have a gun and she goes no I'm like why don't you have a Dutch because why don't know how to get one

1406
01:04:13,055 --> 01:04:16,895
Troy-Bilt 30 minutes explaining to her how you get your purchase permit

1407
01:04:17,151 --> 01:04:18,431
Curious how you get a concealed carry

1408
01:04:18,687 --> 01:04:20,223
Here's where you can take classes

1409
01:04:20,735 --> 01:04:24,063
You need to protect yourself because the police

1410
01:04:24,831 --> 01:04:30,975
Are not going to get there until

1411
01:04:39,935 --> 01:04:41,983
Also you could just spend five minutes going like

1412
01:04:43,007 --> 01:04:44,799
Look you can get all that permits yet

1413
01:04:45,311 --> 01:04:46,335
But you go to a gun show

1414
01:04:46,591 --> 01:04:47,103
Does f******

1415
01:04:47,871 --> 01:04:49,151
So gross

1416
01:04:49,407 --> 01:04:50,431
So gross

1417
01:04:50,687 --> 01:04:54,783
Anytime anyone is like I'm not hitting on you but

1418
01:04:55,551 --> 01:04:58,879
I'm not a racist but of sexual assault

1419
01:04:59,135 --> 01:05:02,207
Exactly in the way you sexualizing this call is

1420
01:05:04,255 --> 01:05:05,535
She didn't call for that

1421
01:05:05,791 --> 01:05:07,071
Evan Grant

1422
01:05:07,327 --> 01:05:09,887
Women

1423
01:05:10,143 --> 01:05:11,679
Are there are there p******

1424
01:05:11,935 --> 01:05:12,703

1425
01:05:13,215 --> 01:05:16,543
P****** alt-right p******

1426
01:05:17,311 --> 01:05:21,151
Second Amendment Hub but like that yeah probably

1427
01:05:22,943 --> 01:05:26,527
The way that they like that call was not sexual in any way

1428
01:05:26,783 --> 01:05:29,343
And the way that he introduced you at

1429
01:05:29,599 --> 01:05:32,671
Well he wouldn't she was a male

1430
01:05:32,927 --> 01:05:33,439
Disagree

1431
01:05:33,695 --> 01:05:34,463
That was

1432
01:05:34,975 --> 01:05:35,487
Violin

1433
01:05:35,743 --> 01:05:37,535
Which two Alex is sexy

1434
01:05:37,791 --> 01:05:42,399
Guy saying like I want to teach other dudes how to shoot

1435
01:05:42,655 --> 01:05:44,959
He wouldn't said it was admirable

1436
01:05:45,471 --> 01:05:48,031
Patriotic

1437
01:05:48,287 --> 01:05:50,847
He's only doing that because she's a woman

1438
01:05:51,103 --> 01:05:53,663
Yeah I mean you can only ultimately sexualized

1439
01:05:53,919 --> 01:05:55,455
In the same way that you do he has

1440
01:05:55,711 --> 01:06:01,855
To describe them as women are being put on a pedestal right because the power thing and I'm glad you brought that

1441
01:06:04,671 --> 01:06:06,719
The West worships women

1442
01:06:06,975 --> 01:06:07,743
Ono

1443
01:06:11,583 --> 01:06:13,631
Women are worshipped

1444
01:06:15,423 --> 01:06:16,447
The Holy Grail

1445
01:06:17,983 --> 01:06:20,031
Women

1446
01:06:20,287 --> 01:06:23,615
Caught in power to the West because they worship in

1447
01:06:25,407 --> 01:06:26,943
What's a fun

1448
01:06:28,223 --> 01:06:29,247
Respond

1449
01:06:29,503 --> 01:06:30,527
Let me ask you a question

1450
01:06:31,039 --> 01:06:35,647
Did women get the right to vote because they were worshipped

1451
01:06:35,903 --> 01:06:41,791
Feel like it wasn't that 140 for years after America was founded for that to happen

1452
01:06:43,839 --> 01:06:44,607
F****** worship

1453
01:06:44,863 --> 01:06:46,911
Maybe it was women coming together be like

1454
01:06:47,167 --> 01:06:48,191
This is f****** b*******

1455
01:06:48,703 --> 01:06:51,007
I'm not even all women like I smaller

1456
01:06:51,263 --> 01:06:54,335
Percentage of women really f******

1457
01:06:56,383 --> 01:07:00,223
Cuz they were worship worship worship

1458
01:07:01,759 --> 01:07:04,319
Gave them the right to vote

1459
01:07:04,575 --> 01:07:06,623
For the right to vote

1460
01:07:07,135 --> 01:07:07,903
Gave it to them

1461
01:07:08,159 --> 01:07:14,303
Because of their worship of fear to talk about the right to vote I want to talk about a couple of more really fun things

1462
01:07:14,559 --> 01:07:20,703
That people don't talk about all that much did you know that until 1922 women lost their

1463
01:07:20,959 --> 01:07:21,471
Citizenship

1464
01:07:21,727 --> 01:07:26,079
If they married a foreigner I could do was just assumed that they would take on the for it

1465
01:07:26,335 --> 01:07:29,919
Status of their husband also

1466
01:07:30,175 --> 01:07:30,687
Women

1467
01:07:30,943 --> 01:07:35,295
Completely do women contain

1468
01:07:35,551 --> 01:07:36,319
And

1469
01:07:36,575 --> 01:07:39,135
That was until 1922 and then get this

1470
01:07:39,391 --> 01:07:43,231
They continued until 1931 if the man was Asian

1471
01:07:43,487 --> 01:07:45,535
Because we hated Asian

1472
01:07:46,303 --> 01:07:52,447
Also did you know that it was completely legal to not allow women to practice law in the United States

1473
01:07:52,703 --> 01:07:54,239
Till 1971

1474
01:07:54,751 --> 01:07:55,263
It was just

1475
01:07:55,519 --> 01:08:01,663
You could just borrow women from getting her their bar exam because their women until 1971

1476
01:08:01,919 --> 01:08:02,943
Supreme Court

1477
01:08:03,199 --> 01:08:08,575
The law would hurt their brain

1478
01:08:10,111 --> 01:08:12,415
Photo on the right side

1479
01:08:12,671 --> 01:08:14,719
That's crazy

1480
01:08:14,975 --> 01:08:17,023
Crazy levels of like a

1481
01:08:17,279 --> 01:08:23,167
If that's worse thing that's not good not allowing women to know the law

1482
01:08:23,679 --> 01:08:25,215
No they couldn't know it

1483
01:08:25,471 --> 01:08:26,239
Pratt

1484
01:08:26,751 --> 01:08:28,287
F****** Christ

1485
01:08:29,823 --> 01:08:30,335
Until

1486
01:08:32,127 --> 01:08:32,895
719 set

1487
01:08:33,919 --> 01:08:34,431
What

1488
01:08:34,687 --> 01:08:36,223
What's 71

1489
01:08:36,735 --> 01:08:38,015
And also did you know that

1490
01:08:38,527 --> 01:08:39,039
America was

1491
01:08:39,295 --> 01:08:39,807
Founded in

1492
01:08:40,063 --> 01:08:40,831
1776

1493
01:08:41,343 --> 01:08:44,671
And then 172 years later

1494
01:08:45,183 --> 01:08:45,695
Right

1495
01:08:45,951 --> 01:08:46,975
The Supreme Court

1496
01:08:47,231 --> 01:08:47,743
Refer to case

1497
01:08:48,511 --> 01:08:49,279
And they decided

1498
01:08:49,535 --> 01:08:52,095
That women could be barred from being bartenders

1499
01:08:52,607 --> 01:08:54,911
Add bars that were known by male relative

1500
01:08:55,167 --> 01:08:55,679
Because quote

1501
01:08:55,935 --> 01:08:57,727
The profession of bartending

1502
01:08:57,983 --> 01:09:00,799
Potentially lead to moral and social problems for women

1503
01:09:02,079 --> 01:09:04,383
I mean hey

1504
01:09:04,895 --> 01:09:05,919
Argue with that

1505
01:09:06,687 --> 01:09:09,759
It took 172 years to get to a bad decision

1506
01:09:10,015 --> 01:09:15,903
Also at it till 1970 it was legal for airlines not to hire stewardesses if they were married

1507
01:09:16,159 --> 01:09:16,671
Until 19

1508
01:09:16,927 --> 01:09:17,695
Scene75 it was

1509
01:09:17,951 --> 01:09:22,047
Completely legal to exclude women from juries just because they were women

1510
01:09:24,095 --> 01:09:25,631
Really think 40% of men

1511
01:09:26,655 --> 01:09:28,703
It's insane all of these weird like things

1512
01:09:29,983 --> 01:09:32,031
It took whatever people talk about women's rights

1513
01:09:32,287 --> 01:09:34,079
They only talk about the basic thing

1514
01:09:34,335 --> 01:09:36,895
Ya basic

1515
01:09:37,151 --> 01:09:38,175
Yeah

1516
01:09:38,687 --> 01:09:39,199
But

1517
01:09:39,455 --> 01:09:40,991
You talk about the right to vote

1518
01:09:41,247 --> 01:09:41,759
Suffragette

1519
01:09:42,015 --> 01:09:46,879
Stuff like that we don't talk about like the ability to work in various profession

1520
01:09:47,135 --> 01:09:50,463
To abortion was guaranteed before the right

1521
01:09:50,719 --> 01:09:51,487
To work on Apple

1522
01:09:52,511 --> 01:09:54,815
Well unless you weren't married cuz they wanted to

1523
01:09:55,071 --> 01:09:56,863
Single people who can be flirty and fun

1524
01:09:58,655 --> 01:09:59,423
It's pretty crazy man

1525
01:09:59,679 --> 01:10:04,031
The same thing is still going on now

1526
01:10:04,287 --> 01:10:06,847
Arthur Arthur restaurants that can

1527
01:10:07,103 --> 01:10:09,919
I reject women who aren't attractive anymore

1528
01:10:10,175 --> 01:10:10,687
Because

1529
01:10:10,943 --> 01:10:12,735
There there

1530
01:10:12,991 --> 01:10:16,575
Classifying their waitresses or or

1531
01:10:17,087 --> 01:10:17,855
Performers

1532
01:10:18,111 --> 01:10:20,159
I believe that you risk

1533
01:10:21,695 --> 01:10:22,463
Getting in trouble

1534
01:10:22,719 --> 01:10:25,023
For that I think I think that there are laws on the book

1535
01:10:25,279 --> 01:10:26,303
From my understanding

1536
01:10:26,815 --> 01:10:31,167
That you can you can run 1,000 w

1537
01:10:31,423 --> 01:10:33,983
Instances you might be talking about like strip clubs

1538
01:10:34,239 --> 01:10:37,823
Them stuff like that is dependent contract

1539
01:10:42,175 --> 01:10:44,223
Your your Tilted Kilt

1540
01:10:44,479 --> 01:10:46,527
Sir or whatever like those b******* like

1541
01:10:46,783 --> 01:10:47,551
Your Hooters or whatever

1542
01:10:48,063 --> 01:10:54,207
They they classify their employees as such and such an order to get away with

1543
01:10:54,463 --> 01:10:55,999
Lose 5 lb you get fired

1544
01:10:56,255 --> 01:10:57,791
We're talking about a secondary issue

1545
01:10:58,047 --> 01:11:00,095
I'm talking about Lex

1546
01:11:00,607 --> 01:11:02,143
It's not like that is

1547
01:11:02,399 --> 01:11:07,775
Entirely gone but I'm more interested in

1548
01:11:08,031 --> 01:11:10,079
The broad Strokes of like

1549
01:11:10,591 --> 01:11:12,895
Women were disallowed

1550
01:11:13,151 --> 01:11:14,431
From all this s***

1551
01:11:14,687 --> 01:11:16,223
Horse

1552
01:11:16,479 --> 01:11:17,503
In the interest of

1553
01:11:18,015 --> 01:11:18,783
Texting them

1554
01:11:19,039 --> 01:11:20,575
Wow

1555
01:11:20,831 --> 01:11:21,599
Talking about insurance

1556
01:11:21,855 --> 01:11:22,367
To the West

1557
01:11:24,159 --> 01:11:25,695
And I don't think anybody got it

1558
01:11:25,951 --> 01:11:27,743
As a b*******

1559
01:11:27,999 --> 01:11:28,511
A lot of

1560
01:11:29,023 --> 01:11:30,815
Call Darrell I think it's just that

1561
01:11:31,071 --> 01:11:32,351
The the type of person

1562
01:11:32,607 --> 01:11:33,119
We are

1563
01:11:33,631 --> 01:11:34,143
Dial

1564
01:11:34,399 --> 01:11:36,959
The 29th

1565
01:11:37,215 --> 01:11:41,055
Alex is sexually harassed call her and then yelled about how the West worship

1566
01:11:43,615 --> 01:11:46,687
Get onto the the 29th

1567
01:11:46,943 --> 01:11:50,783
App screen mostly about how I Islam wants to suck it

1568
01:11:51,295 --> 01:11:52,575
Unfortunately

1569
01:11:52,831 --> 01:11:53,855
On the show

1570
01:11:54,111 --> 01:11:56,671
PS3 gas but two of them are Ted Nugent

1571
01:11:56,927 --> 01:11:58,463
Who became

1572
01:11:58,719 --> 01:12:01,279
13 year old girl's legal guardian so he could have sex

1573
01:12:01,791 --> 01:12:07,679
The mayor may not have gotten a b******* from Courtney Love when she was twelve he was 29

1574
01:12:07,935 --> 01:12:14,079
He was twenty-nine when Courtney Love allegedly blew him in order to

1575
01:12:14,335 --> 01:12:17,663
Have sex with the murky gray area especially

1576
01:12:17,919 --> 01:12:24,063
But it is a key area seems very difficult

1577
01:12:24,319 --> 01:12:27,135
For me to deal with

1578
01:12:27,391 --> 01:12:29,951
The garbage and he has

1579
01:12:30,463 --> 01:12:31,231
Famously

1580
01:12:31,487 --> 01:12:33,023
Try to pick up on a

1581
01:12:33,279 --> 01:12:36,863

Wants to do this whole like

1584
01:12:42,495 --> 01:12:44,287
Basically

About Muslims

1586
01:12:46,847 --> 01:12:48,127
Choose better guest

1587
01:12:49,151 --> 01:12:50,175
So that's most of the show

1588
01:12:50,431 --> 01:12:51,455
And then

1589
01:12:51,711 --> 01:12:53,759
He has a guy on named Mark Moreno

1590
01:12:54,271 --> 01:12:55,039
Choose better gas

1591
01:12:55,295 --> 01:12:57,855
Because the only people who support what it is

1592
01:12:58,111 --> 01:13:04,255
Your b******* things are the people about but that's the thing they're the only ones you were going to come out

1593
01:13:04,511 --> 01:13:06,303
Save it the thing that you're talking about

1594
01:13:06,559 --> 01:13:07,839
F****** sense

1595
01:13:08,351 --> 01:13:10,655
Sears another Gangsta on a mark Moreno

1596
01:13:10,911 --> 01:13:12,703
About climate change

1597
01:13:13,983 --> 01:13:17,823
Climate change denier do you know about Mark Marino I've heard the name before

1598
01:13:18,079 --> 01:13:18,847
Aransas

1599
01:13:19,103 --> 01:13:25,247
The website called climatedepot.com

1600
01:13:25,503 --> 01:13:26,527
Free shipping if you

1601
01:13:26,783 --> 01:13:28,575
Spend over $500 robley

1602
01:13:28,831 --> 01:13:32,927
Exclusively

1603
01:13:33,183 --> 01:13:34,975
Committee for a constructive tomorrow

Witcher believe it or not return always name something

1605
01:13:37,791 --> 01:13:38,303
Sing like that

1606
01:13:38,559 --> 01:13:40,607
They received

1607
01:13:41,375 --> 01:13:43,935
$500,000 in funding from ExxonMobil

1608
01:13:44,191 --> 01:13:46,239
Grace is always the case for climate change

1609
01:13:47,775 --> 01:13:52,127
Start running back to oil companies or Coke related foundations which is also the case

1610
01:13:52,639 --> 01:13:56,479
For committee for a constructed tomorrow they received a bunch of money from the donors fund

1611
01:13:56,735 --> 01:14:00,831
Andy Charles Koch Foundation

1612
01:14:01,087 --> 01:14:01,599
Supreme leader for

1613
01:14:04,159 --> 01:14:05,951
Subjected myself to

1614
01:14:07,487 --> 01:14:09,279
I would really probably just egg

1615
01:14:09,535 --> 01:14:10,559
Execute all of the

1616
01:14:12,095 --> 01:14:15,679
Like I would just start from like or or Amanda

1617
01:14:15,935 --> 01:14:22,079
Family would be even remotely related to the Koch family

1618
01:14:22,335 --> 01:14:24,127
All of their finances and I would just

1619
01:14:24,383 --> 01:14:26,175
You don't need murdered

1620
01:14:26,431 --> 01:14:26,943
You don't need to

1621
01:14:27,199 --> 01:14:27,967
Disease finances

1622
01:14:28,223 --> 01:14:29,503
All you have to do

1623
01:14:29,759 --> 01:14:30,527
Is correct

1624
01:14:31,551 --> 01:14:32,575
All you have to do is

1625
01:14:32,831 --> 01:14:33,599
Put in place

1626
01:14:34,111 --> 01:14:35,135
Sensible regulation

1627
01:14:35,903 --> 01:14:36,927
Sensible oversee

1628
01:14:37,695 --> 01:14:42,303
Good things that they the way that they get away with all this stuff is loophole

1629
01:14:42,559 --> 01:14:43,071
In terms of

1630
01:14:43,327 --> 01:14:45,375
I don't have to report

1631
01:14:45,631 --> 01:14:48,447
Giving hundreds of thousands of dollars through

1632
01:14:48,703 --> 01:14:51,775
Shadow and secondary sound

1633
01:14:52,031 --> 01:14:54,079
Towards these goals that would be

1634
01:14:54,335 --> 01:14:56,127
Very easily debunked

1635
01:14:56,383 --> 01:15:01,247
If you drink for all of it is that there is

1636
01:15:02,527 --> 01:15:03,039
That's what we

1637
01:15:03,295 --> 01:15:05,855
Been dealing with for so long is that it

1638
01:15:06,111 --> 01:15:06,879
Really hard

1639
01:15:07,391 --> 01:15:11,743
Write laws but I'll also

1640
01:15:11,999 --> 01:15:14,303
Kill everyone involved with the Koch brothers

1641
01:15:14,815 --> 01:15:15,839
Maybe we do

1642
01:15:17,631 --> 01:15:19,167
I will be getting rid of it

1643
01:15:19,423 --> 01:15:22,239
Woodforest app

1644
01:15:22,751 --> 01:15:23,263
Sure

1645
01:15:23,519 --> 01:15:27,103
Also also Mark Moreno was one of the first people to

1646
01:15:27,359 --> 01:15:28,127
To publish about

1647
01:15:28,895 --> 01:15:29,919
John Kerry in the swiftboating

1648
01:15:30,175 --> 01:15:36,319
Of course because he used to work for Rush Limbaugh gray taupe suede

1649
01:15:36,575 --> 01:15:37,087
Housing for election

1650
01:15:37,343 --> 01:15:40,415
You know he's a winner hatchet man

1651
01:15:40,671 --> 01:15:41,439
4

1652
01:15:41,695 --> 01:15:42,207
For hire

1653
01:15:42,463 --> 01:15:44,511
It's a really boring episode

1654
01:15:45,023 --> 01:15:46,559
This guy named Doug Hagmann who's

1655
01:15:46,815 --> 01:15:47,583
Super boring

1656
01:15:47,839 --> 01:15:49,119
August 4th hour

1657
01:15:49,375 --> 01:15:50,399
I was going to turn it off

1658
01:15:50,655 --> 01:15:51,167
But I'm glad I did

1659
01:15:52,191 --> 01:15:52,703
Because

1660
01:15:52,959 --> 01:15:53,471
Hagmann

1661
01:15:53,727 --> 01:15:54,239
Yeah he's just a

1662
01:15:56,543 --> 01:15:57,567
Fields

1663
01:15:57,823 --> 01:15:59,103
He's a boring ass dude

1664
01:15:59,359 --> 01:16:00,639
F****** but

1665
01:16:01,407 --> 01:16:04,479
When Alex and Doug Hagmann were having their little overlap

1666
01:16:04,735 --> 01:16:06,271
Before Doug took over the entire fourth

1667
01:16:09,087 --> 01:16:11,647
He was talking about Maria Abramovic and how much

1668
01:16:12,415 --> 01:16:14,719
Doesn't believe in pizzagate

1669
01:16:21,631 --> 01:16:24,703
Will Conquer America

1670
01:16:25,215 --> 01:16:28,031
I'll admit that was for Crowley Magic

1671
01:16:28,543 --> 01:16:29,567
Will crocheting

1672
01:16:38,015 --> 01:16:44,159
He's got the Elixir that will empower the people behind the behind the veil soccorso

1673
01:16:50,815 --> 01:16:54,143
Intercourse

1674
01:16:57,471 --> 01:16:58,751
Yuba City

1675
01:16:59,007 --> 01:16:59,775
You're busted

1676
01:17:00,287 --> 01:17:02,591
You are so busted Alex

1677
01:17:02,847 --> 01:17:05,151
You f****** literally believe

1678
01:17:05,407 --> 01:17:05,919
Yep

1679
01:17:06,431 --> 01:17:07,711
What idiot

1680
01:17:09,247 --> 01:17:09,759
Yep

1681
01:17:10,271 --> 01:17:12,575
He is on the same f****** page

1682
01:17:13,343 --> 01:17:15,391
Every time every time they

1683
01:17:15,647 --> 01:17:19,743
It's so it's so incredible to me that every time they bring up those

1684
01:17:20,255 --> 01:17:22,047
What you would expect is a metaphor

1685
01:17:22,303 --> 01:17:25,119
The Elixir that's going to take us to the next level

1686
01:17:25,631 --> 01:17:26,655
Then they wind up

1687
01:17:26,911 --> 01:17:27,423
Making it

1688
01:17:27,679 --> 01:17:30,239
Clear that they believe there is an elixir

1689
01:17:30,495 --> 01:17:32,799
It's literally literally

1690
01:17:33,055 --> 01:17:35,103
Yeah

1691
01:17:35,359 --> 01:17:36,895
You clearly like we've gone over this

1692
01:17:37,151 --> 01:17:37,663
In

1693
01:17:38,431 --> 01:17:39,967
Exhaustive detail like

1694
01:17:40,735 --> 01:17:41,503
Mcmillions

1695
01:17:41,759 --> 01:17:47,903
Even going into trip report adrenochrome and

1696
01:17:48,159 --> 01:17:48,927
It's a very

1697
01:17:49,183 --> 01:17:49,695
Bad High

1698
01:17:49,951 --> 01:17:51,487
Highbridge is a week high

1699
01:17:51,743 --> 01:17:52,511
No one really

1700
01:17:54,559 --> 01:17:55,071
Overdosing

1701
01:17:55,327 --> 01:17:55,839
Adrenaline

1702
01:17:56,095 --> 01:17:56,607
Really

1703
01:17:57,119 --> 01:17:57,631
Fun Buzz

1704
01:17:58,143 --> 01:18:01,471
Even even if their worldview was like

1705
01:18:01,983 --> 01:18:02,495
This address

1706
01:18:02,751 --> 01:18:06,335
I think we got to scare children to put their blood that we convey

1707
01:18:06,591 --> 01:18:07,103
Drink

1708
01:18:08,383 --> 01:18:09,919
Even if that was true

1709
01:18:10,687 --> 01:18:11,967
The end result of it is

1710
01:18:12,479 --> 01:18:14,271
The elites like a bad Buzz

1711
01:18:14,527 --> 01:18:15,807
That's worse than just

1712
01:18:16,063 --> 01:18:16,575
Weed

1713
01:18:20,159 --> 01:18:21,183
So go f***

1714
01:18:21,439 --> 01:18:24,511
Yourself Alex

1715
01:18:25,023 --> 01:18:28,095
Extra hundred dollars in donation by the end of April

1716
01:18:28,863 --> 01:18:32,447
We will do what episode where we're high on adrenochrome

1717
01:18:32,703 --> 01:18:33,983
And we're highlights

1718
01:18:34,751 --> 01:18:37,311
What are sites you can order it from

1719
01:18:37,567 --> 01:18:43,455
Easy to synthesize you don't even need kids to do it I don't need blood to do it

1720
01:18:43,711 --> 01:18:46,271
We've been over this to the amount

1721
01:18:46,527 --> 01:18:48,063
You could get out of

1722
01:18:48,575 --> 01:18:51,391
Like

1723
01:18:51,647 --> 01:18:53,951
Maximum adrenaline production

1724
01:18:54,463 --> 01:18:55,231
Would be

1725
01:18:55,487 --> 01:18:55,999
Not enough

1726
01:18:57,279 --> 01:18:58,047
Getyourpet crazy

1727
01:18:58,303 --> 01:19:00,607
It's insane

1728
01:19:03,679 --> 01:19:07,007
Higher doses

1729
01:19:07,263 --> 01:19:09,311
The trip reports are

1730
01:19:11,615 --> 01:19:13,407
So you're only Tallassee for this next clip

1731
01:19:15,199 --> 01:19:17,247
So now we're moving on to the 30th

1732
01:19:17,759 --> 01:19:18,271
Which is Friday.

1733
01:19:18,527 --> 01:19:19,039
If you're nasty

1734
01:19:20,831 --> 01:19:21,855
Socket

1735
01:19:22,111 --> 01:19:23,903
Sukkot

1736
01:19:24,927 --> 01:19:25,439
Jordans

1737
01:19:25,695 --> 01:19:26,463
Yeah

1738
01:19:26,719 --> 01:19:31,071
Yep this is cuz this one is

1739
01:19:34,911 --> 01:19:35,679
Frey f*****-up

1740
01:19:35,935 --> 01:19:36,447
Okay

1741
01:19:36,703 --> 01:19:37,215
Very fact

1742
01:19:38,751 --> 01:19:42,079
You're judging people

1743
01:19:42,591 --> 01:19:45,663
Yes your horses I have

1744
01:19:59,231 --> 01:20:00,255
I got four children

1745
01:20:01,023 --> 01:20:03,839
My lucky stars every time they're healthy

1746
01:20:04,095 --> 01:20:04,863
And they're born

1747
01:20:05,119 --> 01:20:07,167
Just

1748
01:20:07,423 --> 01:20:09,727
Hi I have serious guilt

1749
01:20:11,519 --> 01:20:13,824
Think about global km

1750
01:20:14,080 --> 01:20:17,152
About the children and I have no fear

1751
01:20:17,408 --> 01:20:17,920
Juicy

1752
01:20:23,040 --> 01:20:26,368
I mean

1753
01:20:26,880 --> 01:20:28,672
Because of what I did to my children

1754
01:20:31,488 --> 01:20:32,256
Money

1755
01:20:45,568 --> 01:20:48,896
The difference is I'm sorry and I know I'm wrong

1756
01:20:55,296 --> 01:20:56,320
I was young and stupid

1757
01:21:00,160 --> 01:21:02,976
Most girls want a divorce has a couple of them didn't

1758
01:21:03,488 --> 01:21:09,632
I think about those magic children

1759
01:21:10,656 --> 01:21:11,936
Judge you

1760
01:21:12,192 --> 01:21:13,216
God judges you

1761
01:21:13,472 --> 01:21:13,984
Holy

1762
01:21:14,240 --> 01:21:14,752
S***

1763
01:21:15,264 --> 01:21:17,056
Holyshit

1764
01:21:17,312 --> 01:21:19,616
Holyshit

1765
01:21:20,640 --> 01:21:21,664
That's crazy

1766
01:21:22,176 --> 01:21:24,224
He paid for 10 abortions

1767
01:21:24,992 --> 01:21:29,088
At least a song that research

1768
01:21:31,904 --> 01:21:32,672
Pull out

1769
01:21:32,928 --> 01:21:35,488
Rhythm method is not

1770
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:39,328
It's not reliable love unprotect

1771
01:21:43,936 --> 01:21:44,448
Bruh sound effect

1772
01:21:44,704 --> 01:21:48,288
What you're doing is hitting on I think what is

1773
01:21:48,544 --> 01:21:50,592
One of the more important points and that is that like

1774
01:21:51,360 --> 01:21:52,128
People make

1775
01:21:53,920 --> 01:21:56,480
Things happen

1776
01:21:56,992 --> 01:21:58,016
That's a behavior

1777
01:21:59,040 --> 01:22:01,088
That's not that's a

1778
01:22:01,344 --> 01:22:02,624
That's a pattern of behavior

1779
01:22:03,136 --> 01:22:05,696
And I have known a couple people who have

1780
01:22:05,952 --> 01:22:06,720
5

1781
01:22:07,232 --> 01:22:07,744
Open

1782
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:10,816
Who had abortion

1783
01:22:11,072 --> 01:22:11,584
But haven't talked

1784
01:22:12,352 --> 01:22:14,144
But I know a couple people who have

1785
01:22:14,400 --> 01:22:17,472
I have spoken about it and generally it's a wake-up call

1786
01:22:17,984 --> 01:22:19,776
It's generally I like OSHA

1787
01:22:20,032 --> 01:22:22,080
Okay

1788
01:22:22,336 --> 01:22:24,128
Absolutely

1789
01:22:24,384 --> 01:22:24,896
G'head

1790
01:22:25,408 --> 01:22:26,432
An abortion

1791
01:22:26,688 --> 01:22:27,200
Crazy

1792
01:22:27,456 --> 01:22:29,760
So I did some research into this

1793
01:22:30,016 --> 01:22:30,784
24

1794
01:22:31,040 --> 01:22:32,064
13 / 600

1795
01:22:32,320 --> 01:22:34,112
Fifty thousand or so

1796
01:22:34,880 --> 01:22:36,160
Reported abortion

1797
01:22:36,672 --> 01:22:37,696
In the United

1798
01:22:37,952 --> 01:22:38,464
Yeah

1799
01:22:39,232 --> 01:22:41,792
There were about 151 million

1800
01:22:42,048 --> 01:22:42,560
Mail

1801
01:22:44,608 --> 01:22:45,376
In the United

1802
01:22:46,400 --> 01:22:47,168
Assuming

1803
01:22:47,424 --> 01:22:50,240
That all of those people just

1804
01:22:50,496 --> 01:22:52,032
Spread the abortions out evenly

1805
01:22:52,544 --> 01:22:53,312
You have a

1806
01:22:53,568 --> 01:22:55,104
24% chance

1807
01:22:55,616 --> 01:22:58,176
Of being a male Who's involved in abortion in

1808
01:22:58,432 --> 01:22:58,944
Any given year

1809
01:22:59,968 --> 01:23:01,248
Alex Jones was

1810
01:23:01,760 --> 01:23:02,272
That

1811
01:23:04,320 --> 01:23:05,344
Which is crazy

1812
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:06,368
Like

1813
01:23:06,624 --> 01:23:12,768
None of this is just none of this is to judge and then he knows about

1814
01:23:13,024 --> 01:23:14,304
None of this is to judge

1815
01:23:15,328 --> 01:23:19,424
Wrong

1816
01:23:19,680 --> 01:23:20,448
But that's a

1817
01:23:21,472 --> 01:23:25,824
Hi number that's a f****** huge number intentional

1818
01:23:26,080 --> 01:23:31,712
Now the other problem that I think is even more important is when he says

1819
01:23:31,968 --> 01:23:32,992
That's not great

1820
01:23:33,248 --> 01:23:35,040
That's severely f***** up

1821
01:23:36,064 --> 01:23:37,856
That's not great

1822
01:23:38,112 --> 01:23:39,648
Pressuring people into getting abortion

1823
01:23:40,928 --> 01:23:41,440
That

1824
01:23:42,464 --> 01:23:42,976
Wow

1825
01:23:43,232 --> 01:23:43,744
And

1826
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:45,280
Him pretending like

1827
01:23:45,536 --> 01:23:51,680
He's just this guy didn't know any better he was a sucker to the propaganda of abortions

1828
01:23:51,936 --> 01:23:55,776
If he was reading adult

1829
01:23:56,032 --> 01:23:56,800
Textbooks

1830
01:23:57,056 --> 01:23:58,848
And super mature reading

1831
01:23:59,360 --> 01:24:02,432
10000 books about World War when he was 10

1832
01:24:02,688 --> 01:24:05,760
Vig person

1833
01:24:06,016 --> 01:24:08,064
He better when I got

1834
01:24:08,320 --> 01:24:08,832
10

1835
01:24:09,088 --> 01:24:10,368
Women pregnant

1836
01:24:11,136 --> 01:24:11,904
When I was

1837
01:24:14,464 --> 01:24:14,976
Deal with that

1838
01:24:15,488 --> 01:24:20,864
Like I don't like ideological I'm 100%

1839
01:24:21,120 --> 01:24:23,168
Right

1840
01:24:23,680 --> 01:24:24,448
At the same time

1841
01:24:24,704 --> 01:24:28,800
Sequence that is what is is Alex Jones was almost

1842
01:24:29,312 --> 01:24:30,592
Intentionally trying

1843
01:24:32,128 --> 01:24:38,272
Reconcile I would argue

1844
01:24:38,528 --> 01:24:39,040
Tension

1845
01:24:39,296 --> 01:24:39,808
Might

1846
01:24:40,320 --> 01:24:40,832
Be

1847
01:24:41,088 --> 01:24:43,648
You might want to take that away I would say

1848
01:24:44,160 --> 01:24:45,440
I would say compulsive

1849
01:24:46,208 --> 01:24:51,840
I would say at 4 likely explanation is that he was a compulsive Behavior

1850
01:24:52,352 --> 01:24:53,888
That he really enjoyed

1851
01:24:54,400 --> 01:24:56,192
I was able to get away with

1852
01:24:56,448 --> 01:24:57,984
Inasmuch as

1853
01:24:58,240 --> 01:25:01,568
Sometimes they wanted to get abortions on the other times you can pressure him into it

1854
01:25:01,824 --> 01:25:03,104
And it

1855
01:25:03,360 --> 01:25:04,640
You just avoiding

1856
01:25:05,152 --> 01:25:11,296
It's so f***** up that's because f***** up because also the idea that like I learned my lesson

1857
01:25:11,552 --> 01:25:12,576
I'm so sorry

1858
01:25:12,832 --> 01:25:15,136
Yeah that's not

1859
01:25:15,648 --> 01:25:17,952
Why did you learn it the first time

1860
01:25:18,208 --> 01:25:21,024
Why didn't

1861
01:25:21,280 --> 01:25:23,328
Pattern

1862
01:25:23,584 --> 01:25:25,888
Of behavior the first time is it

1863
01:25:26,144 --> 01:25:30,752
As real

1864
01:25:31,008 --> 01:25:35,104
Until they're like I really got to change this

1865
01:25:36,640 --> 01:25:39,456
I don't I don't

1866
01:25:41,504 --> 01:25:46,880
I couldn't be more pro-choice at the same time I think everybody who's pro-choice

1867
01:25:47,392 --> 01:25:48,160
Is not

1868
01:25:48,672 --> 01:25:49,952
Up for 10

1869
01:25:50,208 --> 01:25:51,488
Different women having

1870
01:25:52,768 --> 01:25:58,912
To have abortion I think what it comes down to is generally when you're pro-choice

1871
01:25:59,168 --> 01:26:00,960
One of the most important elements of it is

1872
01:26:01,216 --> 01:26:07,360
Women's health for sports

1873
01:26:07,616 --> 01:26:08,384
Seeing here is

1874
01:26:09,408 --> 01:26:09,920
Alex

1875
01:26:11,712 --> 01:26:12,736
Haven't an abortion

1876
01:26:13,248 --> 01:26:14,784
Which probably with 10 different

1877
01:26:15,296 --> 01:26:15,808
Women

1878
01:26:17,344 --> 01:26:21,696
And that's more him at least like 9 p.m. be a wildly response

1879
01:26:22,976 --> 01:26:28,352
And I'm not judging him for that either he was young and stupid and what have you but like

1880
01:26:28,608 --> 01:26:29,888
I think I am going to judge

1881
01:26:30,144 --> 01:26:33,728
I'm going to judge for the parts of it were he's like some of them

1882
01:26:34,240 --> 01:26:34,752
Want to have

1883
01:26:35,776 --> 01:26:36,288
That's pretty f*****

1884
01:26:37,056 --> 01:26:38,336
And then I'm going to also judge

1885
01:26:38,848 --> 01:26:39,360
4

1886
01:26:40,896 --> 01:26:42,688
Like legitimately when we

1887
01:26:42,944 --> 01:26:44,480
When we hear him talk about

1888
01:26:45,504 --> 01:26:47,552
Pro-choice people being satanic

1889
01:26:47,808 --> 01:26:48,576
To kill their babies

1890
01:26:49,088 --> 01:26:50,624
All it is is that clip

1891
01:26:50,880 --> 01:26:51,392
But you just heard

1892
01:26:51,648 --> 01:26:55,232
Being projected on them he's guilty about his past

1893
01:26:55,488 --> 01:26:56,000
Behavior

1894
01:26:56,256 --> 01:26:57,280
Wanted to

1895
01:26:58,304 --> 01:27:00,096
Maldives

1896
01:27:00,352 --> 01:27:01,376
I don't know how to deal with 10

1897
01:27:02,400 --> 01:27:03,680
I don't think I do I don't think I

1898
01:27:03,936 --> 01:27:04,704
Ever

1899
01:27:04,960 --> 01:27:07,264
I don't think I've ever heard of anybody in

1900
01:27:07,520 --> 01:27:08,032
Involved

1901
01:27:09,312 --> 01:27:10,592
I imagine is a lot

1902
01:27:11,616 --> 01:27:14,432
So many

1903
01:27:14,688 --> 01:27:15,200
Mystically

1904
01:27:19,040 --> 01:27:22,624
You shouldn't have it nothing was judging if you do but it's a lot

1905
01:27:22,880 --> 01:27:23,392
No

1906
01:27:23,648 --> 01:27:25,440
I don't know I don't know how to

1907
01:27:27,488 --> 01:27:28,768
Man that is a f***

1908
01:27:29,024 --> 01:27:31,584
Conundra Brown let's cleanser palette by

1909
01:27:31,840 --> 01:27:33,632
Checking out this next flight for Alex Jones

1910
01:27:34,656 --> 01:27:40,800
Gives his thoughts on Depeche Mode

1911
01:27:47,456 --> 01:27:53,600
Alex Jones radio network

1912
01:28:06,656 --> 01:28:11,520
Depeche Mode

1913
01:28:14,336 --> 01:28:18,688
We cannot possibly like their most recent album

1914
01:28:19,200 --> 01:28:19,712
Because that was

1915
01:28:19,968 --> 01:28:26,112
Victory anti Alex Jones is b*******

1916
01:28:26,624 --> 01:28:29,440
Playing he chose to play on his own program

1917
01:28:29,696 --> 01:28:34,560
I am involved Christianity taking cues from Islam

1918
01:28:34,816 --> 01:28:36,352
I need screams about how like

1919
01:28:36,608 --> 01:28:37,376
Hey

1920
01:28:37,632 --> 01:28:41,472
It was 600 years later not recognizing that

1921
01:28:41,728 --> 01:28:42,240
Paul

1922
01:28:42,496 --> 01:28:45,568
What he wrote all his letters and stuff

1923
01:28:45,824 --> 01:28:47,872
600 don't worry about it

1924
01:28:48,384 --> 01:28:51,456
Pretty worried about it

1925
01:28:51,968 --> 01:28:56,320
Don't don't think about the timeline Paul created

1926
01:28:56,576 --> 01:28:57,088
Church

1927
01:29:02,976 --> 01:29:05,024
Very bored organized religions

1928
01:29:05,280 --> 01:29:07,840
I bet song is a banger though

1929
01:29:08,096 --> 01:29:09,376
In the next

1930
01:29:09,888 --> 01:29:11,680
So now we get to Alex having a gap

1931
01:29:11,936 --> 01:29:13,216
Okay it's a new guest

1932
01:29:16,288 --> 01:29:18,336
Do you know Katie Hopkins name before

1933
01:29:18,592 --> 01:29:19,104
Where she's from

1934
01:29:20,384 --> 01:29:22,944
She's a former reality star from the UK

1935
01:29:23,200 --> 01:29:23,968
That is why I know

1936
01:29:24,736 --> 01:29:26,272
Now I immediately regret knowing that

1937
01:29:26,784 --> 01:29:27,808
She's most notable

1938
01:29:28,064 --> 01:29:30,112
For being a brutal islamophobe

1939
01:29:30,624 --> 01:29:32,416
After terrorists

1940
01:29:32,672 --> 01:29:33,952
The tack you got on Twitter

1941
01:29:34,208 --> 01:29:34,976
Call Tori

1942
01:29:35,488 --> 01:29:36,512
Final solution

1943
01:29:36,768 --> 01:29:39,072
That's not great after the Manchester bombing

1944
01:29:40,608 --> 01:29:43,936
Gray's promoted hoax narratives about the Muslim no-go zones

1945
01:29:44,448 --> 01:29:44,960
She refers

1946
01:29:45,216 --> 01:29:45,728
Constantly

1947
01:29:48,288 --> 01:29:49,568
Cockroaches and rats

1948
01:29:50,336 --> 01:29:50,848
Don't

1949
01:29:51,872 --> 01:29:52,640
Shiro tan

1950
01:29:52,896 --> 01:29:55,200
Anti-immigration calling in the Sun

1951
01:29:55,456 --> 01:29:56,736
Was titled rescue boat

1952
01:29:56,992 --> 01:29:58,016
IG was gunship

1953
01:29:58,528 --> 01:29:59,040
Stop my gray

1954
01:30:00,064 --> 01:30:03,392
In June 2017 she appeared on Fox and Friends and advocated

1955
01:30:03,904 --> 01:30:06,720
Internment camps being set up for suspected Islamic terrorists

1956
01:30:07,232 --> 01:30:10,304
Added you kept conference the UK Independence

1957
01:30:10,560 --> 01:30:11,072
Party

1958
01:30:11,584 --> 01:30:12,096
Northridge

1959
01:30:12,608 --> 01:30:13,632
People who are into

1960
01:30:14,144 --> 01:30:14,656
Brexit

1961
01:30:15,168 --> 01:30:20,032
Hopkins gesture that would be okay if he House of Lords was quotes

1962
01:30:21,312 --> 01:30:22,080
The people

1963
01:30:24,128 --> 01:30:24,896
Always

1964
01:30:25,920 --> 01:30:26,944
But

1965
01:30:27,200 --> 01:30:30,016
Criticize their enemies like like

1966
01:30:30,272 --> 01:30:33,344
Whatever Alex Jones says David Hogg is

1967
01:30:33,600 --> 01:30:34,368
Clicking his heels

1968
01:30:34,624 --> 01:30:37,440
Together and salute

1969
01:30:37,952 --> 01:30:40,256
God dammit they don't love nothing

1970
01:30:40,512 --> 01:30:41,024
Tactics

1971
01:30:42,304 --> 01:30:46,656
Huge fans of genocide they just don't like the uniform I guess like I don't know

1972
01:30:46,912 --> 01:30:49,472
I don't know what's wrong with armbands are out

1973
01:30:49,728 --> 01:30:50,752
Do they not

1974
01:30:51,264 --> 01:30:52,544
Ever hear themselves talk

1975
01:30:53,312 --> 01:30:53,824
Probably not

1976
01:30:54,080 --> 01:30:56,128
We got to keep moving

1977
01:30:56,384 --> 01:30:56,896
Keep distracting

1978
01:31:00,224 --> 01:31:01,248
Israeli government

1979
01:31:01,504 --> 01:31:02,016
Naruto

1980
01:31:05,600 --> 01:31:06,112
Look

1981
01:31:06,624 --> 01:31:07,392
Genocide

1982
01:31:11,744 --> 01:31:16,352
So Katie Hopkins has advocated for a final solution about Islamic terrorism

1983
01:31:17,120 --> 01:31:18,656
Great I keep that in mind as Alec

1984
01:31:31,200 --> 01:31:33,504
No

1985
01:31:33,760 --> 01:31:34,528
Censorship

1986
01:31:35,552 --> 01:31:36,320

1987
01:31:37,344 --> 01:31:41,952

I don't like this

1991
01:31:49,888 --> 01:31:51,680
White supremacist

1992
01:31:52,192 --> 01:31:53,216

You got a boner

2006
01:32:28,032 --> 01:32:30,336
Women voting conservative

Enjoy what you have to say

2011
01:33:02,848 --> 01:33:07,200
Has nothing to do with the kids because you agree with me

2012
01:33:08,736 --> 01:33:11,040
Exactly

2013
01:33:11,552 --> 01:33:12,064
F*****'-a

2014
01:33:12,320 --> 01:33:12,832
Disaster

Notify

2016
01:33:32,544 --> 01:33:35,616
They were awesome

2017
01:33:36,128 --> 01:33:42,272
Why do you think I'm sexy

2018
01:33:49,184 --> 01:33:51,232
Iraq

2019
01:33:53,280 --> 01:33:57,888
There's so many layers to that there's so many layers that the first is that

2020
01:33:58,144 --> 01:34:00,192
Like first of all f*** Katie Hopkins

2021
01:34:00,448 --> 01:34:06,080
Terrible she is appearing on the show

2022
01:34:06,336 --> 01:34:07,360
In case you were wondering

2023
01:34:07,616 --> 01:34:09,152
Cheese for bread

2024
01:34:10,176 --> 01:34:12,736
She is appearing on the show I voted for brexit

2025
01:34:12,992 --> 01:34:14,784
Nigel farage

2026
01:34:17,344 --> 01:34:18,368
Actually he's even like

2027
01:34:19,648 --> 01:34:20,160
We are not

2028
01:34:22,464 --> 01:34:23,744
I'll bet you

2029
01:34:25,024 --> 01:34:25,536
Weird

2030
01:34:27,072 --> 01:34:29,120
Be there as it may she is

2031
01:34:30,144 --> 01:34:32,960
And she's appearing on the show and if yes

2032
01:34:33,216 --> 01:34:34,752
And she's appearing on the show and

2033
01:34:35,008 --> 01:34:35,776
Professional capacity

2034
01:34:36,288 --> 01:34:41,152
Now I disagree with literally everything she's saying but she's not there for Alex Jones to be like

2035
01:34:41,664 --> 01:34:43,200
Pocket turns me on

2036
01:34:43,712 --> 01:34:46,784
I'm married but you're sexy

2037
01:34:53,696 --> 01:34:55,232
LG

2038
01:34:55,488 --> 01:35:01,632
Completely fine thing to do

2039
01:35:01,888 --> 01:35:08,032
Henry and ideology that is entirely built

2040
01:35:10,080 --> 01:35:10,848
F*** you

2041
01:35:11,104 --> 01:35:13,408
I don't give a s*** strongly disagree

2042
01:35:13,664 --> 01:35:15,968
Strongly disagree

2043
01:35:16,224 --> 01:35:19,552
At what point do you become complicit

2044
01:35:19,808 --> 01:35:20,320
And in fact

2045
01:35:21,088 --> 01:35:26,464
Your own subjugation as a as an object

2046
01:35:27,744 --> 01:35:29,792
Principles

2047
01:35:30,304 --> 01:35:31,072
I try to

2048
01:35:31,328 --> 01:35:32,864
Fail

2049
01:35:33,120 --> 01:35:35,168
Play X but

2050
01:35:35,424 --> 01:35:36,192
Principles are at least

2051
01:35:36,448 --> 01:35:38,752
Believe principles that are on

2052
01:35:39,520 --> 01:35:40,288
Are Universal

2053
01:35:40,544 --> 01:35:41,312
ARG

2054
01:35:41,568 --> 01:35:42,848
This must be true

2055
01:35:43,104 --> 01:35:43,872
Otherwise

2056
01:35:44,896 --> 01:35:49,248
I don't know alright and one of them is that kind of behavior towards someone is in Pearl

2057
01:35:50,016 --> 01:35:51,296
I don't care

2058
01:35:51,552 --> 01:35:55,392
I don't care what she advocates for that does not mean that she deserves to be treated

2059
01:35:55,648 --> 01:35:56,160
Okay

2060
01:35:56,672 --> 01:35:58,208
I don't understand

2061
01:35:58,464 --> 01:36:03,072
I don't I understand where you're coming from as well that she is propping up

2062
01:36:03,328 --> 01:36:03,840
The system fed

2063
01:36:04,096 --> 01:36:07,680
Mantu out of nowhere in a professional capacity

2064
01:36:07,936 --> 01:36:09,984
Professional interviews be like

2065
01:36:10,240 --> 01:36:12,288
I'm going to give you a sexual compliment

2066
01:36:12,544 --> 01:36:13,568
Yeah out of nowhere

2067
01:36:13,824 --> 01:36:14,592
I understand

2068
01:36:15,104 --> 01:36:16,128
But at the same time

2069
01:36:16,640 --> 01:36:17,664
That doesn't matter to me

2070
01:36:18,176 --> 01:36:21,504
It matters to me that that is an inappropriate way for a man to

2071
01:36:21,760 --> 01:36:22,528
Behave towards a woman

2072
01:36:22,784 --> 01:36:28,928
And you can tell from listening to that clip is deflect into a self-deprecating

2073
01:36:29,184 --> 01:36:35,328
Didn't comment where she says I'm if you think I'm sexy you need to check your eyes and Alex responses

2074
01:36:35,584 --> 01:36:36,864
By interrupting her

2075
01:36:37,120 --> 01:36:37,632
Insane

2076
01:36:37,888 --> 01:36:39,168
I don't think you look bad

2077
01:36:39,424 --> 01:36:43,008
Or whatever I want to deal with

2078
01:36:43,264 --> 01:36:46,336
The thing that clearly is inappropriate cuz you wouldn't have said

2079
01:36:46,592 --> 01:36:47,360
If you think I'm sexy

2080
01:36:50,176 --> 01:36:53,248
This isn't what I'm here for this is what the conversation

2081
01:36:53,504 --> 01:36:54,784
She tried to deflect it with

2082
01:36:55,040 --> 01:36:56,320
A powerful position

2083
01:36:56,576 --> 01:36:57,600
What is that self

2084
01:36:57,856 --> 01:36:58,368
Deprecating

2085
01:36:58,880 --> 01:36:59,392
I

2086
01:36:59,648 --> 01:37:00,672
Humerus position

2087
01:37:01,184 --> 01:37:02,464
Yeah and

2088
01:37:02,720 --> 01:37:03,232
Work

2089
01:37:03,744 --> 01:37:06,048
She does not deserve to be subjected to

2090
01:37:06,560 --> 01:37:08,352
Just because our positions are horrible

2091
01:37:08,608 --> 01:37:09,632
I do not believe

2092
01:37:10,400 --> 01:37:11,168
Here is

2093
01:37:11,424 --> 01:37:12,960
Here is my

2094
01:37:13,728 --> 01:37:14,240
Okay

2095
01:37:15,008 --> 01:37:17,056
I agree with what

2096
01:37:17,312 --> 01:37:18,080
You are saying

2097
01:37:18,336 --> 01:37:18,848
Annabelle

2098
01:37:19,872 --> 01:37:23,712
In nauna world that we don't f****** live in

2099
01:37:24,224 --> 01:37:25,504
I agree with you in

2100
01:37:25,760 --> 01:37:26,528
Entirely

2101
01:37:26,784 --> 01:37:29,344
At the same time my printful

2102
01:37:29,600 --> 01:37:30,112
Time

2103
01:37:30,880 --> 01:37:31,648
F*** her

2104
01:37:32,672 --> 01:37:33,184
She is

2105
01:37:33,440 --> 01:37:34,208
She is

2106
01:37:34,464 --> 01:37:40,608
Let's go let's go let's go let's go

2107
01:37:40,864 --> 01:37:42,656
Really on your side and at the same time

2108
01:37:42,912 --> 01:37:48,544
I think she f****** does deserve well let's go back to

2109
01:37:49,568 --> 01:37:50,336
Actively accept

2110
01:37:50,592 --> 01:37:53,152
And actively says is the right way for things

2111
01:37:53,408 --> 01:37:59,296
Mitsubishi going to pretend she clearly something that she is not

2112
01:37:59,808 --> 01:38:00,320
Participant

2113
01:38:02,112 --> 01:38:05,952
She clearly doesn't accept it on some level cuz otherwise

2114
01:38:06,208 --> 01:38:08,256
F****** don't do the s*** you're doing

2115
01:38:08,768 --> 01:38:09,536
Wow

2116
01:38:10,048 --> 01:38:12,608
Time

2117
01:38:12,864 --> 01:38:14,656
The problem I have with that

2118
01:38:14,912 --> 01:38:17,984
Is that it reminds me of that argument of

2119
01:38:19,264 --> 01:38:20,288
Dress the way you're dressed

2120
01:38:21,056 --> 01:38:24,896
Expect

2121
01:38:25,152 --> 01:38:30,272
It concerns what it seems like a similar argument time

2122
01:38:30,528 --> 01:38:36,672
It's not 88 don't dress the way you're dressing it's a rapist

2123
01:38:36,928 --> 01:38:37,696
Be allowed to rape

2124
01:38:37,952 --> 01:38:44,096
Right it's the same thing that befell the alt right

2125
01:38:44,352 --> 01:38:44,864
Community

2126
01:38:45,120 --> 01:38:48,448
When Lauren Southern came out and said that you didn't want to have kids

2127
01:38:48,704 --> 01:38:51,264
And everyone got on there and everyone started

2128
01:38:51,520 --> 01:38:57,664
Everyone turned on her you are right

2129
01:38:57,920 --> 01:38:58,944
Sort of thing

2130
01:38:59,712 --> 01:39:03,296
I don't believe that just based on Lauren Southern

2131
01:39:03,808 --> 01:39:05,856
Other awful position

2132
01:39:06,112 --> 01:39:07,648
She deserves to be treated

2133
01:39:07,904 --> 01:39:08,672
Like that

2134
01:39:08,928 --> 01:39:10,976
By the terrible community that she's Court

2135
01:39:11,232 --> 01:39:12,512
You know I don't believe

2136
01:39:12,768 --> 01:39:14,816
I don't believe the Katie Hopkins

2137
01:39:15,072 --> 01:39:15,840
Who I hate

2138
01:39:16,096 --> 01:39:19,168
For her position deserves to be treated like that

2139
01:39:19,424 --> 01:39:22,752
By a guy who invited her on the show

2140
01:39:23,008 --> 01:39:24,032
To talk about

2141
01:39:24,544 --> 01:39:25,056
Admittedly

2142
01:39:25,312 --> 01:39:27,104
White genocide

2143
01:39:27,360 --> 01:39:27,872
But

2144
01:39:28,128 --> 01:39:28,640
I can't

2145
01:39:29,152 --> 01:39:31,456
I cannot agree with you more

2146
01:39:32,224 --> 01:39:34,272
Like I genuinely agree with you

2147
01:39:34,528 --> 01:39:37,600
What what does

2148
01:39:37,856 --> 01:39:38,880
Is

2149
01:39:40,160 --> 01:39:42,720
I think you and I are on the same page on a lot of

2150
01:39:42,976 --> 01:39:45,024
But I don't know if we're a hundred percent

2151
01:39:45,280 --> 01:39:47,840
On the same page in terms of my foot

2152
01:39:48,096 --> 01:39:48,608
Defeat

2153
01:39:48,864 --> 01:39:49,888
About this

2154
01:39:50,400 --> 01:39:50,912
World

2155
01:39:51,424 --> 01:39:52,704
And that is that

2156
01:39:56,288 --> 01:39:59,360
I lost my train of thought

2157
01:39:59,616 --> 01:40:01,664
I'm coming up again

2158
01:40:03,456 --> 01:40:04,224
I100

2159
01:40:04,480 --> 01:40:07,808
Percent agree with Odin

2160
01:40:08,064 --> 01:40:09,088
As a human being

2161
01:40:09,344 --> 01:40:12,160
No one deserves that I found the TranStar

2162
01:40:12,672 --> 01:40:16,512
And I agree with you I don't think she does deserve that

2163
01:40:16,768 --> 01:40:19,584
At the same time if you are saying

2164
01:40:19,840 --> 01:40:20,864
This is the world

2165
01:40:21,120 --> 01:40:21,888
That should be

2166
01:40:22,400 --> 01:40:24,704
The one where I am treated like this

2167
01:40:24,960 --> 01:40:26,240
My sympathy for you

2168
01:40:26,496 --> 01:40:27,776
My empathy for you

2169
01:40:28,032 --> 01:40:28,800
Disappeared

2170
01:40:29,056 --> 01:40:31,360
Will her behavior underlies if that's not what you

2171
01:40:32,384 --> 01:40:35,456
Yeah because they don't f****** make it a reality

2172
01:40:35,712 --> 01:40:40,320
She's not I don't know I don't know

2173
01:40:40,576 --> 01:40:45,952
F****** know here's what I was trying to get to a second ago and I lost my train of thought

2174
01:40:46,208 --> 01:40:49,792
And I don't think we really had a full conversation about this

2175
01:40:50,048 --> 01:40:52,096
Cowardice propaganda stuff

2176
01:40:52,352 --> 01:40:52,864
This entire world

2177
01:40:53,376 --> 01:40:53,888
Sometimes

2178
01:40:54,144 --> 01:40:57,728
What's required of you is doing the thing that feels unnatural

2179
01:40:58,240 --> 01:41:03,360
You know like it's very natural to attract

2180
01:41:04,384 --> 01:41:05,920
He's saying stupid s***

2181
01:41:06,944 --> 01:41:08,992
Feels unnatural to give a pass

2182
01:41:09,248 --> 01:41:09,760
To it

2183
01:41:10,016 --> 01:41:12,320
Because you understand the context of it that

2184
01:41:12,832 --> 01:41:13,600
He is a victim in

2185
01:41:14,112 --> 01:41:15,648
Is being exploited by Alex

2186
01:41:15,904 --> 01:41:16,672
Push these narratives

2187
01:41:16,928 --> 01:41:21,280
Respect in the same way on a different scale and it certainly is not a one-to-one

2188
01:41:21,536 --> 01:41:22,048
Comparison

2189
01:41:22,304 --> 01:41:28,448
It feels very natural to say f*** you you brought this on yourself of course you behave this way Alex is going to sexually harass

2190
01:41:29,984 --> 01:41:36,128
Or turn a sexual compliment out of nowhere red you want to call that harassment or not is your business. Not for me

2191
01:41:36,896 --> 01:41:38,688
It feels natural to dismiss that

2192
01:41:38,944 --> 01:41:40,480
Interstate like f****** who cares

2193
01:41:40,736 --> 01:41:41,760
But I don't think that's

2194
01:41:42,016 --> 01:41:44,320
I think that the unnatural thing

2195
01:41:46,112 --> 01:41:46,880
Looking

2196
01:41:48,928 --> 01:41:49,696
And realizing

2197
01:41:50,208 --> 01:41:51,488
That she did not

2198
01:41:51,744 --> 01:41:53,536
Ask for that she's there in a profession

2199
01:41:53,792 --> 01:41:54,304
Capacity

2200
01:41:54,560 --> 01:41:55,072
And imagine

2201
01:41:55,584 --> 01:41:58,656
World where she's on a different news show

2202
01:41:58,912 --> 01:42:00,448
And I don't know where the guy is like

2203
01:42:01,984 --> 01:42:04,032
Imagine Alex saying that

2204
01:42:04,288 --> 01:42:04,800
Gerald Celente

2205
01:42:05,312 --> 01:42:09,152
Getting like that like imagine you start to get a picture of like

2206
01:42:09,664 --> 01:42:12,736
This is inappropriate behavior whether or not the

2207
01:42:13,248 --> 01:42:13,760
Open is

2208
01:42:14,528 --> 01:42:15,296
Vile monster

2209
01:42:15,808 --> 01:42:17,088
Yeah not that that part is

2210
01:42:17,600 --> 01:42:19,136
Important it's feels like you

2211
01:42:19,392 --> 01:42:20,672
You should say

2212
01:42:20,928 --> 01:42:21,952
F*** you to all these

2213
01:42:22,464 --> 01:42:23,488
Right and now

2214
01:42:23,744 --> 01:42:28,352
No let me let me kind of like the more I think about it here's the here's the reality

2215
01:42:29,632 --> 01:42:30,400
1%

2216
01:42:31,424 --> 01:42:31,936
She does

2217
01:42:32,448 --> 01:42:34,240
She absolutely does not deserve that

2218
01:42:35,008 --> 01:42:35,520
I think

2219
01:42:35,776 --> 01:42:37,312
My issue comes from

2220
01:42:37,824 --> 01:42:39,616
The world that we live in now

2221
01:42:40,128 --> 01:42:41,408
We're in this

2222
01:42:41,920 --> 01:42:44,224
Minority of human being

2223
01:42:44,736 --> 01:42:45,504
Is

2224
01:42:46,528 --> 01:42:48,832
Somehow the strongest

2225
01:42:49,088 --> 01:42:50,624
Overarching

2226
01:42:52,160 --> 01:42:53,952
Dominant philosophy of Art

2227
01:42:54,720 --> 01:42:55,744
So exactly

2228
01:42:56,768 --> 01:42:57,792
Here's where I'm coming

2229
01:42:58,048 --> 01:42:59,584
And I think this is my altar

2230
01:43:00,352 --> 01:43:00,864
I'm listening

2231
01:43:01,120 --> 01:43:01,632
How

2232
01:43:02,400 --> 01:43:03,680
Less less what

2233
01:43:03,936 --> 01:43:04,704
What does anybody

2234
01:43:04,960 --> 01:43:05,472
Deserve

2235
01:43:05,728 --> 01:43:07,264
What day is what is

2236
01:43:08,288 --> 01:43:09,312
Good what is

2237
01:43:10,080 --> 01:43:11,616
The correct way to

2238
01:43:12,640 --> 01:43:13,152
And more

2239
01:43:13,408 --> 01:43:14,688
How do we stamp

2240
01:43:15,712 --> 01:43:16,224
This bulge

2241
01:43:17,248 --> 01:43:19,040
I am coming from a place

2242
01:43:20,576 --> 01:43:23,392
I think you said it I think you stamp It Out by resisting

2243
01:43:24,160 --> 01:43:25,440
The easy Road

2244
01:43:25,696 --> 01:43:27,232
How does that work

2245
01:43:27,744 --> 01:43:29,280
How did that work for

2246
01:43:29,536 --> 01:43:30,816
How did that work for Hillary Clinton

2247
01:43:31,328 --> 01:43:32,864
You know when they go low we go high

2248
01:43:33,120 --> 01:43:34,656
She went but that's just a catch for

2249
01:43:35,936 --> 01:43:37,472
I mean I'm not

2250
01:43:39,264 --> 01:43:42,080
That I respect is the actual

2251
01:43:42,336 --> 01:43:43,872
I entirely respect that as well

2252
01:43:45,408 --> 01:43:48,224
The actual work

2253
01:43:48,480 --> 01:43:51,296
It's actually wrestling issues

2254
01:43:51,552 --> 01:43:53,600
Dealing with reality on reality term

2255
01:43:54,880 --> 01:43:55,904
In reality

2256
01:43:56,160 --> 01:43:56,928
Katie Hopkins

2257
01:43:57,184 --> 01:43:57,696
Is a f******

2258
01:43:57,952 --> 01:43:58,720
Monster

2259
01:43:58,976 --> 01:43:59,488
Bought

2260
01:44:00,768 --> 01:44:01,280
Human

2261
01:44:01,792 --> 01:44:02,560
She doesn't deserve

2262
01:44:02,816 --> 01:44:08,960
The pier or anything that you've done in the past or any positions that she has does not marry

2263
01:44:09,728 --> 01:44:11,520
Her coming on Alex Jones Show

2264
01:44:12,032 --> 01:44:13,824
Talk about how bad Islam is

2265
01:44:14,336 --> 01:44:14,848
She shouldn't be doing

2266
01:44:15,104 --> 01:44:17,664
Yeah I design treated like a sexual object

2267
01:44:18,176 --> 01:44:19,200
For Alex to flirt

2268
01:44:19,456 --> 01:44:20,480
Is

2269
01:44:20,992 --> 01:44:22,016
That is more

2270
01:44:22,784 --> 01:44:25,088
My point and it's f****** it's f****** tough

2271
01:44:25,344 --> 01:44:25,856
Because

2272
01:44:26,112 --> 01:44:26,624
I mean

2273
01:44:26,880 --> 01:44:27,904
I don't want it I don't want

2274
01:44:28,160 --> 01:44:30,464
Putting you on blast cuz everyone has their

2275
01:44:30,720 --> 01:44:31,232
Their position

2276
01:44:31,488 --> 01:44:32,512
Tanzanite

2277
01:44:33,024 --> 01:44:34,048
Yeah but in the

2278
01:44:34,304 --> 01:44:36,608
In the Facebook group go home and tell your mother you're brilliant

2279
01:44:36,864 --> 01:44:38,656
We had some conversation

2280
01:44:39,680 --> 01:44:41,472
Particularly about rack

2281
01:44:41,984 --> 01:44:42,496
Yeah

2282
01:44:42,752 --> 01:44:44,032
And there were people who were

2283
01:44:44,288 --> 01:44:45,312
On the side

2284
01:44:46,080 --> 01:44:47,616
Yeah that's like that

2285
01:44:49,408 --> 01:44:50,432
I understand

2286
01:44:50,688 --> 01:44:53,760
Where is that voice come from

2287
01:44:54,784 --> 01:45:00,672
She brought this on herself

2288
01:45:00,928 --> 01:45:06,560
Trying to avoid that entails this Behavior

2289
01:45:06,816 --> 01:45:08,608
That's what you're saying

2290
01:45:09,120 --> 01:45:09,632
Exact

2291
01:45:09,888 --> 01:45:10,656
Maybe the cat

2292
01:45:11,936 --> 01:45:12,448
But

2293
01:45:13,216 --> 01:45:13,728
If

2294
01:45:14,496 --> 01:45:15,008
I believe

2295
01:45:16,800 --> 01:45:18,592
She had this worldview

2296
01:45:18,848 --> 01:45:19,872
That was beckoning

2297
01:45:20,128 --> 01:45:21,152
This sort of behavior on

2298
01:45:21,664 --> 01:45:22,944
Her response would be

2299
01:45:23,200 --> 01:45:23,712
Then

2300
01:45:23,968 --> 01:45:24,480
A self Depp

2301
01:45:24,736 --> 01:45:25,504
For kading deflection

2302
01:45:26,272 --> 01:45:27,040
If you clearly.

2303
01:45:27,552 --> 01:45:31,648
What you want to talk about is how

2304
01:45:31,904 --> 01:45:34,720
There is a play that's being put up called the assassination of

2305
01:45:34,976 --> 01:45:36,000
Katie Hopkins

2306
01:45:36,256 --> 01:45:37,536
And Alex has to

2307
01:45:37,792 --> 01:45:38,304
Interrupt

2308
01:45:38,560 --> 01:45:39,072
In order to

2309
01:45:40,608 --> 01:45:42,656
I think that her world is you

2310
01:45:42,912 --> 01:45:43,680
Wow

2311
01:45:43,936 --> 01:45:44,704
Korin

2312
01:45:45,216 --> 01:45:46,240
Stupid

2313
01:45:47,520 --> 01:45:48,032
It doesn't

2314
01:45:48,288 --> 01:45:50,080
It does not imply that

2315
01:45:50,336 --> 01:45:50,848
She should

2316
01:45:51,616 --> 01:45:52,128
Or

2317
01:45:52,384 --> 01:45:53,152
Is Cool Whip

2318
01:45:53,664 --> 01:45:54,176
That sort of

2319
01:45:55,200 --> 01:45:58,272
Because I'm sure I I don't think you could ever talk to her

2320
01:46:00,064 --> 01:46:01,344
Like

2321
01:46:01,856 --> 01:46:04,160
I just now in fantasy booking

2322
01:46:04,672 --> 01:46:09,792
Yeah I meant afterwards

2323
01:46:15,168 --> 01:46:15,936
Okay

2324
01:46:16,192 --> 01:46:16,960
Let me try and get it

2325
01:46:17,216 --> 01:46:17,728
To it this way

2326
01:46:19,520 --> 01:46:20,032
I think

2327
01:46:20,544 --> 01:46:23,872
That my position on this is becoming

2328
01:46:26,688 --> 01:46:27,712
The reason that

2329
01:46:27,968 --> 01:46:29,248
We Are Who We Are

2330
01:46:30,272 --> 01:46:30,784
Is empathy

2331
01:46:32,576 --> 01:46:34,368
Bright empathy and understanding

2332
01:46:34,880 --> 01:46:35,648
The recognition that

2333
01:46:37,184 --> 01:46:37,696
Human

2334
01:46:38,208 --> 01:46:38,976
That is

2335
01:46:39,488 --> 01:46:40,512
Part of our beliefs

2336
01:46:41,792 --> 01:46:42,560
And I think

2337
01:46:43,328 --> 01:46:44,352
I'm I'm

2338
01:46:45,120 --> 01:46:45,888
Wrestling with the

2339
01:46:46,144 --> 01:46:46,656
The fact that

2340
01:46:46,912 --> 01:46:47,680
For not fact

2341
01:46:47,936 --> 01:46:49,472
I'm wrestling with the concept of

2342
01:46:50,240 --> 01:46:50,752
Maybe that's

2343
01:46:51,008 --> 01:46:51,520
Why were Luke

2344
01:46:52,288 --> 01:46:52,800
What up losing

2345
01:46:53,312 --> 01:46:54,592
Where We Are

2346
01:46:54,848 --> 01:46:56,640
We will Arnold

2347
01:46:56,896 --> 01:47:00,224
Nobody has ever lost as hard as we are losing right now

2348
01:47:00,480 --> 01:47:00,992
Knowledge

2349
01:47:01,248 --> 01:47:01,760
Losing

2350
01:47:03,552 --> 01:47:04,320
I mean that

2351
01:47:04,576 --> 01:47:07,648
I think you need to adjust your definition

2352
01:47:08,160 --> 01:47:08,672
Lucent

2353
01:47:10,208 --> 01:47:11,488
Climate change is out of control

2354
01:47:11,744 --> 01:47:13,792
Income inequality has never been higher

2355
01:47:14,304 --> 01:47:17,888
Civil rights are being destroyed at every possible f****** oportun

2356
01:47:18,400 --> 01:47:21,216
Naruto

2357
01:47:22,752 --> 01:47:23,520
That is just

2358
01:47:23,776 --> 01:47:24,544
Purely

2359
01:47:25,568 --> 01:47:26,592
Little

2360
01:47:26,848 --> 01:47:27,616
Be empathetic

2361
01:47:27,872 --> 01:47:29,152
Big picture

2362
01:47:29,664 --> 01:47:30,176
Terrible

2363
01:47:34,272 --> 01:47:34,784
OurWorld

2364
01:47:35,296 --> 01:47:35,808
OurWorld

2365
01:47:36,064 --> 01:47:37,344
The only things that we have

2366
01:47:37,600 --> 01:47:38,624
Control over our

2367
01:47:39,648 --> 01:47:40,160
The show

2368
01:47:40,416 --> 01:47:41,184
Yeah perception

2369
01:47:41,696 --> 01:47:42,464
AR

2370
01:47:42,976 --> 01:47:43,488
Prince

2371
01:47:44,768 --> 01:47:45,792
Right

2372
01:47:46,048 --> 01:47:47,584
I think that no matter what happens

2373
01:47:48,096 --> 01:47:50,144
In the bigger world you have an opera

2374
01:47:50,400 --> 01:47:52,704
Opportunity to speak out against it or accept

2375
01:47:53,216 --> 01:47:54,752
Those are the two starters like Waze

2376
01:47:55,008 --> 01:47:55,520
You can

2377
01:47:55,776 --> 01:47:57,056
You can live

2378
01:47:57,568 --> 01:47:59,616
And it's your decision whether you want to in

2379
01:48:01,408 --> 01:48:02,944
The moral decision or anything like that some

2380
01:48:06,272 --> 01:48:07,296
But be that as it may

2381
01:48:11,392 --> 01:48:14,208
The reality of the world is not

2382
01:48:14,464 --> 01:48:15,232
Are choosing

2383
01:48:15,744 --> 01:48:16,768
We are

2384
01:48:17,280 --> 01:48:21,632
Mirror actors on the the stage as it worth we don't get to

2385
01:48:22,400 --> 01:48:22,912
Play weeaboo

2386
01:48:23,424 --> 01:48:24,448
Yes and we have to

2387
01:48:24,960 --> 01:48:25,728
Figure out how to get

2388
01:48:25,984 --> 01:48:26,496
Through it

2389
01:48:26,752 --> 01:48:27,264
You and I

2390
01:48:28,032 --> 01:48:30,848
There is not much we can do other than

2391
01:48:31,616 --> 01:48:32,384
Express our opinions

2392
01:48:33,152 --> 01:48:33,920
And try and put out

2393
01:48:35,456 --> 01:48:38,528
The best we can do it in this context

2394
01:48:38,784 --> 01:48:39,296
Yes we can

2395
01:48:39,552 --> 01:48:40,064
Convoke

2396
01:48:40,320 --> 01:48:41,856
Protests also we can

2397
01:48:42,112 --> 01:48:42,880
Encourage people to

2398
01:48:43,392 --> 01:48:44,416
Active in

2399
01:48:45,952 --> 01:48:47,744
Yes but beyond that

2400
01:48:48,000 --> 01:48:49,280
It is not our fault

2401
01:48:50,816 --> 01:48:51,328
Fault it's

2402
01:48:51,840 --> 01:48:52,352
Even

2403
01:48:52,608 --> 01:48:53,376
Arnon listener

2404
01:48:53,632 --> 01:48:55,168
That the world as it is

2405
01:48:55,424 --> 01:48:56,448
Exist

2406
01:48:56,704 --> 01:48:57,984
Yes but it does

2407
01:49:00,544 --> 01:49:01,568
We have to exist within it

2408
01:49:01,824 --> 01:49:07,968
I would argue that just

2409
01:49:08,480 --> 01:49:10,016
Because all of the

2410
01:49:10,528 --> 01:49:11,296
Big-picture stuff

2411
01:49:11,808 --> 01:49:12,320
Real bat

2412
01:49:12,576 --> 01:49:15,136
Just because of that doesn't necessarily mean

2413
01:49:15,648 --> 01:49:16,928
We're losing

2414
01:49:17,184 --> 01:49:18,208
Or is it everything is

2415
01:49:18,464 --> 01:49:19,488
Is terrible

2416
01:49:19,744 --> 01:49:21,024
Terrible but doesn't mean we're losing

2417
01:49:21,536 --> 01:49:23,328
You only really lose when you give up your

2418
01:49:23,584 --> 01:49:24,096
Your principles

2419
01:49:24,352 --> 01:49:25,888
You only really lose when

2420
01:49:26,400 --> 01:49:27,168
You are not

2421
01:49:27,424 --> 01:49:28,192
Fighting for

2422
01:49:29,472 --> 01:49:30,496
That which you believe in

2423
01:49:31,776 --> 01:49:32,288
Yeah

2424
01:49:32,544 --> 01:49:35,360
Because cuz all of this stuff could get turned back

2425
01:49:35,872 --> 01:49:37,152
All of it could be fit

2426
01:49:38,176 --> 01:49:38,944
It would be a fight

2427
01:49:39,456 --> 01:49:40,992
And it'll take a while

2428
01:49:41,248 --> 01:49:42,528
But all the stuff

2429
01:49:42,784 --> 01:49:44,832
Is really terrible is not undoable

2430
01:49:45,344 --> 01:49:45,856
It'll just

2431
01:49:46,112 --> 01:49:46,624
Take rationale

2432
01:49:46,880 --> 01:49:47,648
Calmer heads

2433
01:49:48,160 --> 01:49:48,672
That's

2434
01:49:49,184 --> 01:49:51,488
And a beating down of

2435
01:49:51,744 --> 01:49:57,120
Great voices and Nazis put them back into the corner of the internet

2436
01:49:57,376 --> 01:49:58,144
But then the question

2437
01:49:59,168 --> 01:50:00,192
And this is

2438
01:50:00,448 --> 01:50:05,824
This is something that was was wrestled with during the Civil Rights Movement

2439
01:50:07,104 --> 01:50:07,616
Intensely

2440
01:50:08,128 --> 01:50:09,408
Is the difference

2441
01:50:09,664 --> 01:50:10,944
The effectiveness

2442
01:50:12,480 --> 01:50:14,272
Total pacifism versus

2443
01:50:14,784 --> 01:50:15,296
Violent Acts

2444
01:50:16,320 --> 01:50:16,832
I mean

2445
01:50:17,344 --> 01:50:19,648
Yourself

2446
01:50:20,160 --> 01:50:22,976
Slavery was intended by pacifier

2447
01:50:23,232 --> 01:50:25,280
Slavery was intended by

2448
01:50:27,072 --> 01:50:32,192
Slavery was intended by all of those things how slavery was ended by a f****** War

2449
01:50:32,448 --> 01:50:38,592
No I'd like Martin Luther King wouldn't have existed without Malcolm X and Stokely Carmichael

2450
01:50:38,848 --> 01:50:41,408
He wouldn't even have survived as long as he did

2451
01:50:41,664 --> 01:50:47,040
Killed if it wasn't for the complete

2452
01:50:47,552 --> 01:50:50,368
Psychopathy of the people

2453
01:50:50,624 --> 01:50:51,648
And

2454
01:50:52,160 --> 01:50:53,696
Spoiler alert

2455
01:50:54,976 --> 01:51:01,120
Look those are related to this conversation

2456
01:51:01,376 --> 01:51:07,520
Agree with you I have to give up that that idea that I

2457
01:51:07,776 --> 01:51:09,056
The forces that are

2458
01:51:14,432 --> 01:51:15,200
Pacifist

2459
01:51:15,456 --> 01:51:16,224
Philosophical

2460
01:51:16,480 --> 01:51:16,992
It's just you say

2461
01:51:17,504 --> 01:51:18,272
Baby imperfect

2462
01:51:18,528 --> 01:51:24,160
Perfect example

2463
01:51:29,792 --> 01:51:32,864
A bunch of people who realize that fascism ain't Great Britain

2464
01:51:33,120 --> 01:51:34,656
Do you have that certain

2465
01:51:34,912 --> 01:51:35,424
Continuum

2466
01:51:35,680 --> 01:51:36,960
Yeah that exist

2467
01:51:38,240 --> 01:51:39,264
I don't know I don't have it

2468
01:51:39,520 --> 01:51:40,800
Going to play out I don't know anyting

2469
01:51:41,056 --> 01:51:44,640
But the only reason this conversation is going on this long is

2470
01:51:45,408 --> 01:51:45,920
I'm

2471
01:51:46,432 --> 01:51:48,224
Going out of my way

2472
01:51:48,736 --> 01:51:49,248
Defend

2473
01:51:49,504 --> 01:51:50,016
Someone

2474
01:51:50,528 --> 01:51:51,040
Yeah

2475
01:51:51,296 --> 01:51:51,808
I'm

2476
01:51:52,832 --> 01:51:54,880

2477
01:51:55,136 --> 01:51:56,160

Thanks

2481
01:52:06,912 --> 01:52:07,936
That's the end of that set

2482
01:52:10,752 --> 01:52:14,080
I have another pack but it's this was an aggressive conversation and I see

2483
01:52:14,336 --> 01:52:15,104
I think you are right

2484
01:52:15,360 --> 01:52:20,736
We are we just f***** now we need a cigarette and now let's smoke a cigarette in

2485
01:52:20,992 --> 01:52:21,760
Enjoy

2486
01:52:22,272 --> 01:52:25,856
This clip that will undo all good will towards Katie Hopkins

2487
01:52:27,136 --> 01:52:28,928
At one point Alex Jones I guess

2488
01:52:29,184 --> 01:52:29,952
Take a call

2489
01:52:30,208 --> 01:52:31,232
You just let her host

2490
01:52:31,488 --> 01:52:32,256
Entire segment

2491
01:52:32,512 --> 01:52:35,072
Trade-ideas what kind of s*** she's pushing

2492
01:52:35,840 --> 01:52:40,192
The white Farm in South Africa is outside with the white rhino

2493
01:52:47,360 --> 01:52:50,944
The only difference is that because it's a white

2494
01:52:51,968 --> 01:52:52,480
We've been over this

2495
01:52:52,992 --> 01:52:53,760
God damn time

2496
01:52:55,040 --> 01:52:57,600
The the white farmer murder narrative

2497
01:52:58,624 --> 01:53:00,160
Very clearly about something

2498
01:53:00,416 --> 01:53:01,184
Play Nelson Prior Lake

2499
01:53:01,440 --> 01:53:02,464
Cuz if you look at murder rate

2500
01:53:04,512 --> 01:53:05,024
South Africa

2501
01:53:05,280 --> 01:53:06,304
Right now what you find is

2502
01:53:06,560 --> 01:53:07,328
Young black

2503
01:53:08,096 --> 01:53:08,608
Being murdered

2504
01:53:08,864 --> 01:53:09,376
Way more

2505
01:53:12,192 --> 01:53:16,544
Always anyway she who's who's

2506
01:53:17,056 --> 01:53:18,592
Young black women are young white

2507
01:53:19,360 --> 01:53:20,640
Who won the

2508
01:53:21,664 --> 01:53:22,176

2512
01:53:30,112 --> 01:53:30,624
On the other show

2513
01:53:33,184 --> 01:53:36,512
All the world went to Russia

2514
01:53:54,176 --> 01:53:55,200
No response other than

2515
01:53:55,456 --> 01:54:01,600
We're going to end up with like so many Clips like that

2516
01:54:01,856 --> 01:54:02,368

And you're lying

2521
01:54:07,744 --> 01:54:08,512
And you're lying

2522
01:54:08,768 --> 01:54:11,072
So at the end of the day I don't give a s***

2523
01:54:13,632 --> 01:54:14,912

01:54:35,136 --> 01:54:36,672
Santa Rita

2534
01:54:38,720 --> 01:54:39,232
Reinforces the

2535
01:54:40,768 --> 01:54:43,584
You had nothing to do even with his godparents

2536
01:54:46,912 --> 01:54:50,496
The things that were taken away from Jews in Nazi Germany

2537
01:54:50,752 --> 01:54:52,288
Quartz turns out most the time he

2538
01:54:52,544 --> 01:54:53,056
He was playing

2539
01:54:53,312 --> 01:54:53,824
In the field

2540
01:54:54,080 --> 01:54:54,592
Anyway

2541
01:54:56,384 --> 01:54:56,896
Alex

2542
01:54:57,152 --> 01:54:58,176
This is really funny

2543
01:54:59,456 --> 01:55:00,480
He is insisting

2544
01:55:00,736 --> 01:55:01,248
It's Taurus

2545
01:55:01,504 --> 01:55:03,040
Keeps trying to reach out to him

2546
01:55:03,552 --> 01:55:04,320
And this

2547
01:55:04,576 --> 01:55:05,344
Is the

2548
01:55:05,600 --> 01:55:07,392
This is almost the equivalent of a lesbian

2549
01:55:07,904 --> 01:55:08,416
TV is talking

2550
01:55:09,184 --> 01:55:10,976

01:55:59,872 --> 01:56:04,480
Had to do what he did

2564
01:56:05,248 --> 01:56:07,040
Would you ever want to talk to George Soros

2565
01:56:09,088 --> 01:56:10,368
He seems like an interesting guy

2566
01:56:11,904 --> 01:56:12,928

Brutal

2586
01:57:32,800 --> 01:57:34,848
In this clip

2587
01:57:35,360 --> 01:57:36,384
Alex's

2588
01:57:36,640 --> 01:57:38,944
He is operating under that like that dumb

2589
01:57:39,712 --> 01:57:40,736
He has that like

2590
01:57:41,504 --> 01:57:43,296
Whenever there is a

2591
01:57:44,064 --> 01:57:45,600
Mass shooting the people are talking

2592
01:57:45,856 --> 01:57:49,696

Dumb

2595
01:57:52,768 --> 01:57:54,304
He believes

2596
01:57:57,376 --> 01:57:58,144
Furthermore

2597
01:57:58,656 --> 01:57:59,424
Once again

2598
01:57:59,936 --> 01:58:03,520
The majority of Guns is owned by 1%

2599
01:58:03,776 --> 01:58:05,056
That's very small

2600
01:58:05,568 --> 01:58:07,104
Tiniest amount variable

2601
01:58:07,360 --> 01:58:08,128

Gun owners

2603
01:58:10,176 --> 01:58:10,944
Generally speaking

2604
01:58:11,712 --> 01:58:12,224
Define

01:58:13,248 --> 01:58:17,600
I hate guns more than anybody

2606
01:58:17,856 --> 01:58:21,184
Has been proven by all of the things that I've said

2607
01:58:23,232 --> 01:58:24,768
Most gun owners are

2608
01:58:25,536 --> 01:58:26,304
Totally

2609
01:58:27,072 --> 01:58:28,608
Alex

2610
01:58:28,864 --> 01:58:30,656
Is projecting a lot of guilt onto himself

2611
01:58:30,912 --> 01:58:31,936
And then he spins

2612
01:58:32,704 --> 01:58:33,216
One of the

2613
01:58:33,472 --> 01:58:36,032
The stupidest idea ever had

2614
01:58:37,824 --> 01:58:40,384

Every knife on ursulines

You didn't know that

2624
01:59:30,816 --> 01:59:32,352
Porter Chevy

2625
01:59:33,632 --> 01:59:39,008
American Ford and Chevy owners

Mercedes truck

2627
02:00:07,168 --> 02:00:09,728
You have this vehicle

2628
02:00:12,544 --> 02:00:14,592
Hundreds

2629
02:00:14,848 --> 02:00:20,992
Portal

2630
02:00:22,528 --> 02:00:28,672
Vehicle that was associated with number 277

02:00:37,376 --> 02:00:39,936
And 87 people died including the driver

2634
02:00:41,984 --> 02:00:47,104
Then what do you think actually the the real world of what he's talking about

2635
02:00:54,784 --> 02:00:57,088
If there was going to be like this field

2636
02:00:57,856 --> 02:00:58,880
And let's say

02:00:59,392 --> 02:01:00,672
Like let's make it

2638
02:01:01,440 --> 02:01:02,720
Like sort of an analog of

2639
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:04,512
Controller

2640
02:01:05,792 --> 02:01:06,304
What's going on

2641
02:01:08,096 --> 02:01:10,912
It's specifically designed only for killing people

2642
02:01:11,168 --> 02:01:15,008
Right let's write like the DeLorean where are the monster truck

2643
02:01:17,568 --> 02:01:20,128
Alex was going on

2644
02:01:22,432 --> 02:01:25,248
The Destroyer 5000 be allowed on Road

2645
02:01:25,760 --> 02:01:27,296
Everyone know and it's not

2646
02:01:30,368 --> 02:01:31,136
The version

2647
02:01:31,392 --> 02:01:34,208
This logic is so f****** stupid because

2648
02:01:34,464 --> 02:01:35,488
On one level

2649
02:01:36,256 --> 02:01:37,024
Everyone who drives

2650
02:01:37,280 --> 02:01:37,792
Car is

2651
02:01:38,048 --> 02:01:38,816
License

2652
02:01:41,376 --> 02:01:42,656
Get in trouble for

2653
02:01:43,936 --> 02:01:44,960
Part of what people would like to

2654
02:01:45,216 --> 02:01:45,728
Steve Gunn

2655
02:01:45,984 --> 02:01:48,288
Secondarily the restrictions

2656
02:01:48,544 --> 02:01:49,056
The people want

2657
02:01:49,312 --> 02:01:51,104
Speed on guns are things that are like

2658
02:01:51,360 --> 02:01:53,152
Do this gun has no

2659
02:01:53,408 --> 02:01:56,480
Legitimate real purpose outside of killing people

2660
02:01:57,760 --> 02:02:03,904
And if there was a car that was like humorously brought up

2661
02:02:07,232 --> 02:02:13,376
Ventrac even then

2662
02:02:14,912 --> 02:02:19,520
Immediately

2663
02:02:19,776 --> 02:02:20,800
So anyway

2664
02:02:21,568 --> 02:02:25,152
Hilarious idea

2665
02:02:25,920 --> 02:02:26,432
What are those

2666
02:02:26,944 --> 02:02:29,760
I can't wait.

2667
02:02:30,016 --> 02:02:30,528
Arguments

2668
02:02:30,784 --> 02:02:31,552
Makes sense

2669
02:02:32,320 --> 02:02:33,088
If you never think

2670
02:02:33,856 --> 02:02:40,000
If you never think critically about it in the same way that earlier we were talking about the baby was on the last step

2671
02:02:40,256 --> 02:02:42,048
Episode we were talking about this

2672
02:02:42,304 --> 02:02:43,072
18%

2673
02:02:43,328 --> 02:02:45,632
Of Millennials go to church 41%

2674
02:02:45,888 --> 02:02:47,680
Of generations

2675
02:02:47,936 --> 02:02:54,080
Perfect sense if you never think about a critical shoot around helmet

2676
02:02:55,360 --> 02:02:55,872
Right now

2677
02:02:58,176 --> 02:02:58,944
Go to the second

2678
02:02:59,200 --> 02:03:00,480
Stephanie realize like this

2679
02:03:00,992 --> 02:03:01,504
Logic does

2680
02:03:02,016 --> 02:03:03,296
Work like if

2681
02:03:03,552 --> 02:03:04,064
If

2682
02:03:05,600 --> 02:03:06,112
Yes

2683
02:03:06,880 --> 02:03:08,928
Intimate conversation that people were having

2684
02:03:09,440 --> 02:03:09,952
Which

2685
02:03:11,232 --> 02:03:13,536
I understand why they might have it but I don't think it

2686
02:03:14,560 --> 02:03:15,584
The idea Village

2687
02:03:15,840 --> 02:03:16,864
People should not be allowed

2688
02:03:18,144 --> 02:03:20,192
Is that was the conversation that was going on

2689
02:03:20,448 --> 02:03:21,984
I'd be much more sympathetic to Alex

2690
02:03:23,008 --> 02:03:24,800
In the in the sense of like

2691
02:03:25,568 --> 02:03:26,336
I get it

2692
02:03:27,104 --> 02:03:28,384
In terms of gun ownership

2693
02:03:28,640 --> 02:03:29,664
For like a rifle

2694
02:03:29,920 --> 02:03:30,688
Do you want to hunt

2695
02:03:31,200 --> 02:03:32,224
Or handgun

2696
02:03:32,736 --> 02:03:35,040
That you deal with responsibly and have locked up

2697
02:03:36,832 --> 02:03:38,368
You like those sorts of things

2698
02:03:38,624 --> 02:03:39,648
If people were saying

2699
02:03:39,904 --> 02:03:40,416
No one can

2700
02:03:40,672 --> 02:03:41,952
Can own any of these

2701
02:03:43,232 --> 02:03:44,000
I get it

2702
02:03:45,792 --> 02:03:46,304
We on the side of

2703
02:03:48,096 --> 02:03:49,376
But I would be served

2704
02:03:49,632 --> 02:03:50,400
Pathetic and much

2705
02:03:50,656 --> 02:03:52,448
More it's like engaged with the ark

2706
02:03:52,704 --> 02:03:54,240
But because the argument

2707
02:03:54,496 --> 02:03:55,520
Isabel

2708
02:03:55,776 --> 02:03:56,800
Semi-automatic weapon

2709
02:03:57,312 --> 02:03:58,848
That it is about a psaltery

2710
02:03:59,360 --> 02:04:00,128
It is about

2711
02:04:00,640 --> 02:04:01,408
Modifications

2712
02:04:01,920 --> 02:04:02,432
Can be made

2713
02:04:02,688 --> 02:04:03,968
With

2714
02:04:04,224 --> 02:04:06,784
Very simple adjustments you can do on your own

2715
02:04:08,064 --> 02:04:10,112
And things like that or little modifications

2716
02:04:10,368 --> 02:04:13,184
You can buy at stores because that's what people are talking

2717
02:04:13,952 --> 02:04:14,464
I am

2718
02:04:14,976 --> 02:04:15,744
Unless the pathetic

2719
02:04:16,000 --> 02:04:21,632
His logic called for complete disarmament

2720
02:04:21,888 --> 02:04:22,400
.

2721
02:04:22,912 --> 02:04:23,424
But if

2722
02:04:23,936 --> 02:04:25,472
Autopia

2723
02:04:25,728 --> 02:04:26,496
If we climb

2724
02:04:26,752 --> 02:04:27,264
Good point

2725
02:04:27,520 --> 02:04:28,288
Alright alright

2726
02:04:34,944 --> 02:04:36,992
If guns were only Recreation

2727
02:04:37,504 --> 02:04:43,648
If guns were like we talked about only recreational

2728
02:04:43,904 --> 02:04:44,928
You could go to this

2729
02:04:45,184 --> 02:04:46,208
Place and shoot

2730
02:04:46,464 --> 02:04:47,744
And they have their gun

2731
02:04:48,000 --> 02:04:53,632
You get to have your perfect or some sort of like a wildlife refuge

2732
02:04:53,888 --> 02:05:00,032
Animals for hunting or bowling

2733
02:05:00,288 --> 02:05:02,592
Are those balls are for you today

2734
02:05:02,848 --> 02:05:08,224
I'm totally fine with that granted even that analogy doesn't play work as a lot of people have their own ball

2735
02:05:09,504 --> 02:05:11,296
Yeah

2736
02:05:11,808 --> 02:05:13,088
You can't murder people the ball

2737
02:05:13,344 --> 02:05:19,488
You know like that. How you could help murdered with a bowl

2738
02:05:19,744 --> 02:05:22,304
You're a little bit at fault as well

2739
02:05:22,560 --> 02:05:24,608
Or you're living in a cartoon

2740
02:05:32,032 --> 02:05:32,544
It is madness

2741
02:05:35,104 --> 02:05:36,640
I love that Alex is like

2742
02:05:38,432 --> 02:05:39,200
I'm going to put make the

2743
02:05:39,456 --> 02:05:40,224
This video and it's going

2744
02:05:40,480 --> 02:05:41,248
Spell all of the

2745
02:05:41,504 --> 02:05:42,016
This s*** like

2746
02:05:42,528 --> 02:05:44,832
Like 45 different logical problem

2747
02:05:45,088 --> 02:05:45,856
What your

2748
02:05:46,112 --> 02:05:46,880
You're trying to espouse

2749
02:05:47,136 --> 02:05:49,952
But like we've got to the end of this you just explain conservative

2750
02:05:50,464 --> 02:05:53,536
You have four or five different logical problems with which shoes

2751
02:05:54,048 --> 02:05:56,352
Bolt clip

2752
02:05:59,168 --> 02:06:04,800
Podcastville last another 45 minutes give or take I'm we're going to discuss whether or not reality is valid

2753
02:06:06,080 --> 02:06:07,104
Like to talk

2754
02:06:07,360 --> 02:06:12,480
About the Gambino family to talk

2755
02:06:12,736 --> 02:06:18,112
About I want to talk about skulduggery I want to talk about

2756
02:06:18,368 --> 02:06:19,392
A Carlton Fisk

2757
02:06:19,648 --> 02:06:25,792
Other rapper other new living room

2758
02:06:26,048 --> 02:06:32,192
Let's bring in nails

2759
02:06:32,448 --> 02:06:38,592
Throw it all in the ghetto

2760
02:06:38,848 --> 02:06:39,872
One of the best albums

2761
02:06:40,128 --> 02:06:41,408
Buy Beach

2762
02:06:41,664 --> 02:06:47,808
Had the song bling bling on it that I wanted to love back in 1997

2763
02:06:48,832 --> 02:06:50,112
Really stuck in a

2764
02:06:50,624 --> 02:06:52,416
Pacific resort my taste

2765
02:06:52,672 --> 02:06:55,232
It just things I know from that time

2766
02:06:55,744 --> 02:07:01,888
Holy triumvirate Dirty South specially Louisiana

2767
02:07:02,144 --> 02:07:03,936
Anna in Memphis

2768
02:07:05,216 --> 02:07:07,264
Stuff that was really famous back when I was

2769
02:07:07,520 --> 02:07:08,032
Ralph

2770
02:07:08,288 --> 02:07:09,824
And did you hear

2771
02:07:10,336 --> 02:07:16,480
Almost immediately for no reason no one can think of any reason somebody survive

2772
02:07:16,736 --> 02:07:17,504
Yes he did

2773
02:07:17,760 --> 02:07:19,296
And no limit survived on

2774
02:07:20,064 --> 02:07:20,832
Very bad leg

2775
02:07:21,344 --> 02:07:26,208
But then the two of them and hypnotize Minds

2776
02:07:26,464 --> 02:07:30,560
Include like Three 6 Mafia

2777
02:07:30,816 --> 02:07:32,096
Project Pat

2778
02:07:32,608 --> 02:07:35,424
Those guys

2779
02:07:35,680 --> 02:07:39,776
Like it was a lot of I did like other stuff like A Tribe Called Quest in

2780
02:07:40,288 --> 02:07:43,360
Brand Nubian a lot of other stuff too

2781
02:07:43,616 --> 02:07:47,712
But the movement of course who doesn't love that

2782
02:07:47,968 --> 02:07:48,736
Like I got

2783
02:07:49,760 --> 02:07:51,808
No Limit and cash money

2784
02:07:52,064 --> 02:07:56,416
Apologize for it

2785
02:07:57,440 --> 02:07:58,976
I wasn't trying to argue

2786
02:07:59,488 --> 02:08:00,256
You always take

2787
02:08:01,792 --> 02:08:06,912
Upstairs whatever you say that you love this music is like any response to you being like

2788
02:08:07,168 --> 02:08:13,312
No Limit was the best I didn't say that

2789
02:08:13,568 --> 02:08:15,104
Mr. Serv on CD

2790
02:08:15,616 --> 02:08:17,920
You'll pry it from my cold dead hands

2791
02:08:20,480 --> 02:08:20,992
Back on track

2792
02:08:23,808 --> 02:08:24,576
On the 30th

2793
02:08:25,088 --> 02:08:25,600
Here

2794
02:08:25,856 --> 02:08:28,928
We heard him the only podcast that will get you

2795
02:08:29,184 --> 02:08:31,744
A sober and serious gun-control debate

2796
02:08:32,000 --> 02:08:32,768
Directly to

2797
02:08:33,280 --> 02:08:35,584
Is no limit as good as Danzig sit is

2798
02:08:36,608 --> 02:08:37,376
Even

2799
02:08:37,632 --> 02:08:40,192
I've got to push back on

2800
02:08:43,520 --> 02:08:47,104
You're misrepresenting my feelings on it I don't think it's good

2801
02:08:47,360 --> 02:08:51,200
I don't think it's good I just listen to it when I was 12

2802
02:08:52,736 --> 02:08:53,248
I just

2803
02:08:53,504 --> 02:08:58,368
No it don't like it although there are a few songs that are pretty good

2804
02:08:59,648 --> 02:09:01,184
Cmurders talented

2805
02:09:03,232 --> 02:09:08,352
That's the Alex Jones at pivot

2806
02:09:08,608 --> 02:09:10,656
EBC probably still be relevant

2807
02:09:13,728 --> 02:09:15,264
I'm going to go with

2808
02:09:16,032 --> 02:09:16,544
No

2809
02:09:16,800 --> 02:09:20,640
If you go to listen to life-and-death or bossalini some of those early albums

2810
02:09:20,896 --> 02:09:22,688
He's very very talented

2811
02:09:23,200 --> 02:09:25,504
He has a smooth flow also

2812
02:09:25,760 --> 02:09:28,320
Can pickup is also very creative

2813
02:09:28,576 --> 02:09:30,112
Yourself anyway

2814
02:09:31,136 --> 02:09:32,928
On the 30th of March

2815
02:09:36,256 --> 02:09:37,792
Rock You

2816
02:09:39,584 --> 02:09:42,656
On the 30th Alex Jones by the way

2817
02:09:43,168 --> 02:09:43,680
Good to be bad

2818
02:09:43,936 --> 02:09:50,080
I love you to all the 30th Alex started the show by talk

2819
02:09:50,336 --> 02:09:51,104
Talking about how many abortion

2820
02:09:51,360 --> 02:09:56,736
And I didn't even bring this up

2821
02:09:56,992 --> 02:09:59,040
He immediately fix a phone call

2822
02:09:59,296 --> 02:10:00,064

Probably really exploitative dude

2896
02:13:46,368 --> 02:13:48,416

02:14:07,616 --> 02:14:13,760
In the same way that slimming baby did with money cash money
