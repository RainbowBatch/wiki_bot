1
00:00:04,096 --> 00:00:10,240
Alex

2
00:00:11,776 --> 00:00:12,544
Is it around

3
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:14,336
Beverages and talk about Alex

4
00:00:16,128 --> 00:00:20,736
That's nearly as much as Jobs

5
00:00:21,248 --> 00:00:22,016
Really

6
00:00:24,832 --> 00:00:30,464
The number of people that I want

7
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,000
Certainly the

8
00:00:32,512 --> 00:00:33,792
It's greatly appreciated

9
00:00:36,352 --> 00:00:38,144
Half as many

10
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:44,544
I would have assumed that it was much like Alex Jones real Liquors in Chicago

11
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:47,104
Negative out of a job

12
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,128
Let me ask you a question

13
00:00:49,152 --> 00:00:51,200
Could possibly be a reason that

14
00:00:51,456 --> 00:00:52,224
People would listen

15
00:00:53,248 --> 00:00:54,016
Beyond at Subway

16
00:00:54,272 --> 00:00:59,136
Is it like is there a dynamic between the two of us

17
00:00:59,648 --> 00:01:03,488
We're friends

18
00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:19,360

00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:36,512
I'd like to remind everyone that we have a live show coming up at North bar on cell

00:01:36,768 --> 00:01:37,280

23
00:01:37,536 --> 00:01:43,680

24
00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:44,960
Smart this is

25
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,544

You should come check if you live in other parts of the country of the world

31
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:11,584
Do you happen to have friends in Chicago

32

00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:26,399
I'm in

97
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:27,935
Who don't know who he is

98
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:29,471
He's a guy who created

99
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:31,007
The show called free domain

100
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:32,543
He considers him

101
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:34,335
Himself the most popular

102
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:35,359
Philosopher

103
00:05:35,615 --> 00:05:37,663
On the on iTunes or on the Internet

104
00:05:38,175 --> 00:05:41,503
These videos where he's just like in front of

105
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:44,319
Discussing philosophical Concepts

106
00:05:44,575 --> 00:05:47,903
All right so he's an idiot he's really smart

107
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:50,719
No I mean Smart in the technical sense

108
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:51,743
Okay

109
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:52,511
Chameleon

110
00:05:53,023 --> 00:05:54,047
You get here

111
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:57,375
And it seems me to say so cuz

112
00:05:57,887 --> 00:06:00,959
Is a libertarian

113
00:06:01,215 --> 00:06:03,519
All right so he's an idiot

114
00:06:07,359 --> 00:06:08,895
He is legitimately a call later

115
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:11,199
Okay there are actual support groups

116
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:13,247
People who have broken away from

117
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:14,527
His freedomain Radio

118
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:16,575
Heap

119
00:06:16,831 --> 00:06:17,343
He believes

120
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:19,391
Do anything he called

121
00:06:19,903 --> 00:06:20,671
Which is

122
00:06:20,927 --> 00:06:21,951
On the surface

123
00:06:22,207 --> 00:06:23,231
A really decent thing

124
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:25,791
I'm not going to play anything of

125
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:30,399
Maybe everybody because he is a dangerous

126
00:06:30,911 --> 00:06:34,239
F****** dingdong he's enraged

127
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:37,055
He has a habit of suing

128
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:37,823
People

129
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:41,151
Or pressingly copyright charges against them if they use

130
00:06:41,407 --> 00:06:41,919
Eclipse

131
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:43,199
Him to prove him wrong

132
00:06:43,967 --> 00:06:44,479
Do you like tents

133
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:46,527
He took down an opponent

134
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:48,831
YouTube channel because they were using it

135
00:06:50,879 --> 00:06:52,159
It like that

136
00:06:58,303 --> 00:06:59,583
It sounds good on the surface

137
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:02,143
And what it is is Eid

138
00:07:02,655 --> 00:07:06,495
Write get Rick Roll

141
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:11,615
Don't have to

142
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:13,663
Abusive people in your life

143
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:15,711
People are negative

144
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:16,991
You can cut them out of your

145
00:07:18,527 --> 00:07:19,295
Suppressive person

146
00:07:21,087 --> 00:07:21,599
You don't go

147
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:27,999
Phrase It's actually good cuz you do have the right to keep negative influences out of your life but

148
00:07:28,511 --> 00:07:29,023
Problem is

149
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:30,047
She believed

150
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:33,119
Did anybody who doesn't believe in v

151
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:35,935
Libertarian anarcho-capitalist

152
00:07:36,191 --> 00:07:38,239
Are abusing you

153
00:07:38,495 --> 00:07:40,031
AMV

154
00:07:40,287 --> 00:07:42,079
Exactly that sort of thing

155
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:45,663
He has videos where he goes on and on talking about how like

156
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:48,479
If you support the idea of me going

157
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:49,247
To prison

158
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:50,527
Cuz I don't pay my taxes

159
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:53,343
Then you support government violence

160
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:54,111
Against me

161
00:07:54,623 --> 00:07:56,927
Why should I allow you in my life

162
00:07:57,183 --> 00:07:58,719
If you support violence

163
00:07:58,975 --> 00:07:59,743
Against me

164
00:08:00,255 --> 00:08:01,279
So basically

165
00:08:01,535 --> 00:08:03,071
He's advocating that it's

166
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:04,863
Reasonable and necessary

167
00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:07,679
To cut anyone out of your life who believes in taxes

168
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:13,055
Pulling some sort of irrational illogical Jiu-Jitsu on it

169
00:08:13,567 --> 00:08:19,711
Yeah damn smart people because he is incredibly smart and very manipulative

170
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:23,039
Then the only contacts

171
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:24,063
Between which UK

172
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:25,087
You can say that is

173
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:26,623
He's incredibly smart

174
00:08:27,135 --> 00:08:28,415
And talented at the scale of make

175
00:08:28,671 --> 00:08:29,695
Idiot

176
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:36,095
I recommend anybody who's interested do this there's a lot of videos on YouTube you can find

177
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:37,375
Used to be a part of his

178
00:08:37,631 --> 00:08:38,143
His flock

179
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:39,167
Discuss

180
00:08:39,423 --> 00:08:40,191
The experience

181
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:41,471
Of being

182
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:43,007
Soccer team basically

183
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:46,079
Very smart articulate people

184
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:50,687
You know they thought they were getting involved in something political and it turned out it was a

185
00:08:52,479 --> 00:08:56,831
You know what's up

186
00:08:57,087 --> 00:08:59,135
Bullet Clapper or Brennan saying like

187
00:08:59,391 --> 00:09:01,439
Sometimes the road to ending up

188
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:02,719
Doing treasonous things

189
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:03,999
It doesn't appear that it's

190
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:05,023
Until it's too late

191
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:07,071
Oh yeah

192
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:10,143
I think I mean

193
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:11,167
The Intern

194
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:11,935
Your life

195
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:17,055
Don't know

196
00:09:17,311 --> 00:09:18,079
And tell your aunt

197
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:20,127
But it's something really f***** up

198
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:23,711
There's a Common Thread among all of the people

199
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:26,527
It's the same thing with suicide

200
00:09:28,063 --> 00:09:29,599
It really is like a path

201
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:30,623
Completing Moana

202
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:32,671
I'm hopeless

203
00:09:33,183 --> 00:09:33,951
I don't know what I'm doing

204
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:35,999
Nobody is giving me any good advice

205
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:39,327
That just gives you this like

206
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:40,095
This hope

207
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:42,399
Talladega

208
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:46,239
It's the same way with suicide

209
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:49,823
You know the if you don't commit suicide

210
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:52,639
You know if you get through that 5 minutes

211
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:53,663
Or whatever length

212
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:56,735
The time then all the sudden

213
00:09:56,991 --> 00:09:57,759
It wasn't that big a

214
00:09:58,527 --> 00:09:59,551
What you get over

215
00:10:00,063 --> 00:10:02,367
That happens with people who join

216
00:10:02,623 --> 00:10:03,391
Did they get there

217
00:10:03,647 --> 00:10:04,927
EBay get him at that right moment

218
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:09,023
Smart or dumb

219
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:09,791
But

220
00:10:10,047 --> 00:10:11,071
If you're the cult leader

221
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:12,863
Generally you have some

222
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:13,887
Some sort of charismatic

223
00:10:14,143 --> 00:10:14,655
Intelligence

224
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:16,959
About you

225
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:21,823
He is

226
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:22,591
Worst

227
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:23,615
Is the van

228
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:26,175
YouTube

229
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:30,783
You can find a video of this somewhere but

230
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:33,599
After Elliot Rodger

231
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:35,903
And killed a bunch of people cuz

232
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:37,183
Women wouldn't have sex with him

233
00:10:38,719 --> 00:10:40,255
Stefan molyneux

234
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:42,559
Okay

235
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:48,959
Yeah his whole angle

236
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:54,847
Trespass to get around all of the obvious idiots I recall it had to do with like women

237
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:57,151
F****** strong.

238
00:10:57,407 --> 00:11:00,223
You're going to end up causing this sort of thing

239
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:05,087
Of course what the f*** are you talkin about

240
00:11:05,599 --> 00:11:07,903
But anyway it's not like that I have bread

241
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:09,695
To beat them

242
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:13,535
Insane person

243
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:14,815
Like these clips

244
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:15,583
Exist

245
00:11:16,863 --> 00:11:17,375
Stefan molyneux

246
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:19,423
His work because he has this

247
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,471
Copyright

248
00:11:22,239 --> 00:11:22,751
And has

249
00:11:23,007 --> 00:11:23,519
Take an action

250
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:25,311
People

251
00:11:26,591 --> 00:11:27,359
Pretty reticent

252
00:11:27,615 --> 00:11:28,383
The post clips

253
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:30,175
All the evil stuff

254
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:35,039
It's still there but you got to dig through hours of him rambling about

255
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:37,087
Esoteric points in philosophy

256
00:11:38,623 --> 00:11:41,183
Stop it sounds benign in order to get to those points

257
00:11:41,951 --> 00:11:44,255
So he gets a lot of cover out of

258
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:48,607
I mean thank God understand the irony of him being a

259
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:54,239
Leonardo Grant

260
00:11:54,495 --> 00:11:57,311
Obviously he's a f****** moron

261
00:11:57,567 --> 00:12:00,127
Get it

262
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:02,687
So on Wednesday Alex has

263
00:12:03,199 --> 00:12:04,991
Stephon on

264
00:12:05,503 --> 00:12:09,087
Cute problem basically

265
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:13,695
He's worse than wack

266
00:12:14,719 --> 00:12:15,231
Way too nice

267
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:16,767
Cult leader

268
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:17,791
On his show

269
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:20,863
I may have a chummy tees on

270
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:22,911
And then Alexander Dugan

271
00:12:23,679 --> 00:12:24,191
I was just like

272
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:25,727
I don't know what

273
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:26,751
To do I just

274
00:12:27,007 --> 00:12:27,775
Xbox the present

275
00:12:28,543 --> 00:12:31,103
So I just I looked at that and I said I don't want to live in

276
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:31,871
Present

277
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:34,943
So here's an out-of-context drop

278
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:35,711
Talkin about

279
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:37,503
As I've said

280
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:39,295
Raptors are

281
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:41,855
Play the pastor in a lot in this discussion

282
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:52,607
Rector

283
00:12:52,863 --> 00:12:53,375
Brothers

284
00:12:59,007 --> 00:13:05,151
I have discovered something really f***** up

285
00:13:05,663 --> 00:13:07,711
That is gorgeous

286
00:13:12,575 --> 00:13:13,599
As I've said

287
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:15,391
Raptors are

288
00:13:15,647 --> 00:13:17,183
Going to factor in a lot in this

289
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:19,999
Discussion

290
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:25,887
Simone biles

291
00:13:26,143 --> 00:13:32,287
Still die but

292
00:13:32,543 --> 00:13:35,871
Celebrate

293
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:39,199
Is bachelor party

294
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:40,735
Congrats

295
00:13:40,991 --> 00:13:41,503
3 hours of

296
00:13:41,759 --> 00:13:43,039
Stefan molyneux going on

297
00:13:45,855 --> 00:13:48,159
Yes Raptors are going to factor heavily

298
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:53,023
Project Camelot

299
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:54,047
You don't normally

300
00:13:56,863 --> 00:13:57,887
Outside of the context

301
00:13:58,143 --> 00:14:00,191
Project Camelot

302
00:14:00,703 --> 00:14:02,239
There's going to be a very narrow path

303
00:14:02,751 --> 00:14:03,263
Conversation

304
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:05,823
I can go down to know a lot about

305
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:12,735
To decide what Raptors is this a Jurassic Park

306
00:14:12,991 --> 00:14:13,503
Situation

307
00:14:13,759 --> 00:14:14,783
Is this day as

308
00:14:15,039 --> 00:14:16,063
You mentioned Falconer said

309
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:22,975
Done much in the playoffs for a long time

310
00:14:29,119 --> 00:14:31,167
I have no f****** clue and anything could have

311
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:34,239
It could be all of them everything

312
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:37,055
Certainly they're not going to be talking about

313
00:14:37,567 --> 00:14:38,335
Tracy McGrady

314
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:39,359
No

315
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:43,199
Who is on the Raptors

316
00:14:47,551 --> 00:14:49,343
40 years old they still playing

317
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:52,415
God bless him when I stopped watching basketball

318
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:53,951
Around that time

319
00:15:00,095 --> 00:15:01,375
Not theirs

320
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:03,679
Is amazing right now.

321
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:05,471
I know why I'm doing this

322
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:06,751
Because you do

323
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:07,519
Too afraid

324
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:09,055
To get to

325
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:15,967
Jordan

326
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:22,111
Look at it for those of you who have not listened to our entire back catalogue whenever we need

327
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:25,951
We dip our toes into the world of Project Camelot

328
00:15:26,207 --> 00:15:27,743
Kerry Cassidy

329
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:28,767
Natality

330
00:15:31,327 --> 00:15:34,911
Jordan and I could not get her name right for a very long time

331
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:37,471
We need to do that

332
00:15:40,031 --> 00:15:40,799
Strolling around

333
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:44,127
After I got sick of the idea of listening to Alex

334
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:45,407
And I saw

335
00:15:45,919 --> 00:15:46,431
An interview

336
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:48,991
With a lady named Joanne Richards

337
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:59,231
Alex Jones

338
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:04,351
I have been for 16 years

339
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:06,143
Got if I can get into it

340
00:16:06,655 --> 00:16:07,423
So this is

341
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:11,775
Connection to the Alex Jones Show

342
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:13,823
We're still we're still doing research

343
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:15,359
We're still doing research today

344
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:17,407
I'm not I'm not

345
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:20,991
121 related

346
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:22,271
The same topic

347
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:23,551
Of course not

348
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:29,951
Much more fun

349
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:41,215
Because they believe in good and everything is negative all the

350
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:45,311
Phoenix drop is great and Patriots are awesome

351
00:16:46,847 --> 00:16:48,127
Even though

352
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:51,711
Still coming

353
00:16:57,599 --> 00:17:02,463
So we're going to be start we're going to be covering two episodes of Project Camelot

354
00:17:02,975 --> 00:17:03,487
At this Jordan

355
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:04,511
Is going to be

356
00:17:05,023 --> 00:17:08,863
An incredible roller coaster ride. I have

357
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:11,167
Speaker review

358
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:14,239
I like

359
00:17:15,007 --> 00:17:16,799
It took every bit of strength

360
00:17:17,311 --> 00:17:18,079
First of all.

361
00:17:18,335 --> 00:17:21,663
To tell you that I was doing a project

362
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:24,479
Do not

363
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:26,015
Spoil where this is going

364
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:27,295
Is so hard

365
00:17:27,807 --> 00:17:31,135
I'm going to try and lay this out as best I can

366
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:31,903
And hope for the best

367
00:17:32,159 --> 00:17:33,695
All right this first clip is

368
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:35,487
Kerry Cassidy

369
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:38,047
Sitting down with the Joanne

370
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:39,839
Message Richard auction

371
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:43,423
She doesn't really know how to give herself an introduction

372
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:44,191
Is an author

373
00:17:44,703 --> 00:17:46,495
I seen her name on top of books

374
00:17:46,751 --> 00:17:48,031
Probably a different one

375
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:53,663
I don't think you're ready

376
00:17:54,175 --> 00:17:55,711
Two runs a website about Earth

377
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:56,479
Garden

378
00:17:56,735 --> 00:17:59,807
Commander something like that this is not the same

379
00:18:00,319 --> 00:18:01,599
This introduction

380
00:18:01,855 --> 00:18:04,159
The self-introduction

381
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:05,695
But let's sit through just

382
00:18:05,951 --> 00:18:07,487
To get a little bit of a trumpet

383
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:09,023
Everything

384
00:18:09,279 --> 00:18:10,559
Okay so

385
00:18:10,815 --> 00:18:12,351
Joanne actually you know

386
00:18:12,863 --> 00:18:18,495
Other than I think you you're an accountant on the side you have a background in journalism

387
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:20,031
I know and

388
00:18:20,287 --> 00:18:24,127
You are married to a very important individual in my view

389
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:25,919
And I

390
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:28,479
You've also been on the circuit now

391
00:18:29,503 --> 00:18:32,831
Basically talking about his information and Publishing it

392
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:37,183
And putting it on a on a very interesting website called Earth Defense

393
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:38,719
Headquarters

394
00:18:39,487 --> 00:18:41,279
And an n

395
00:18:41,535 --> 00:18:44,863
Give yourself your own introduction

396
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:45,631
Just

397
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:51,007
You know to let people know a little bit more about you before we kind of launched into everything

398
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:58,687
Where do I start I grew up in Southern California basically

399
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:08,927
High School

400
00:19:09,183 --> 00:19:11,999
In Utah a while married a few different guys

401
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:23,775
Private clients and also for different Atwood employee for a while

402
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:25,823
Off and on for 35 years

403
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:27,615
I have

404
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:34,271
A grown daughter and three wonderful grandchildren in Portland in Washington

405
00:19:34,527 --> 00:19:35,295
This is a lot of

406
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:41,695
Superfluous

407
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:48,863
Years with known each other since

408
00:19:50,143 --> 00:19:52,447
1997

409
00:19:53,215 --> 00:19:58,591
And we courted for five years and then

410
00:19:59,103 --> 00:20:05,247
I'm just flies when you're having fun

411
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:09,087
So I threw up watching Martian movies in the Sci-Fi movies

412
00:20:19,071 --> 00:20:20,095
I never thought much about it

413
00:20:20,351 --> 00:20:26,495
Oh here we go

414
00:20:32,639 --> 00:20:36,991
A real people did without everybody else knowing about it it's like wow

415
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:43,647
And then he read about this man you adore almost getting killed over and over and over again and then fighting

416
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:44,927
Aliens and

417
00:20:50,815 --> 00:20:51,839
All kinds of

418
00:20:52,095 --> 00:20:56,959
Wonderful topics along the way right but I'll be there about your life

419
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:01,055
I want to know about your daughter

420
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:02,079
Iowa I like

421
00:21:02,335 --> 00:21:08,479
I like getting that stuff in because I want to stress as we go along Joanne seems like a sweet lady

422
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:13,599
Marigolds

423
00:21:17,184 --> 00:21:20,000
And then you hear about the man you love fighting aliens

424
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:22,304
No

425
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:27,680
This is mostly about Joann's husband mark

426
00:21:27,936 --> 00:21:31,776
They're going to be discussing a lot of information that comes from him

427
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:39,968
We're going to learn

428
00:21:40,224 --> 00:21:42,272
So much about Raptors

429
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:50,208
That is that's already

430
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:53,024
Mark was ever in the military

431
00:21:57,376 --> 00:21:58,656
I don't think he was in the military

432
00:21:59,168 --> 00:21:59,936
I'm going to sleep now

433
00:22:04,288 --> 00:22:10,176
They were in the alternate military

434
00:22:12,224 --> 00:22:14,784
Time travel

435
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:19,392
Starts with a lot of

436
00:22:19,648 --> 00:22:20,160
Sort of

437
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:22,976
Pleasantrees you can kind of tell that their friend

438
00:22:23,232 --> 00:22:26,304
Maybe the first 10 minutes or so end up being them

439
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,144
Now it is what it is

440
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,448
But then we get into some real issues

441
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:33,728
Andy start with

442
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:34,496
Current events

443
00:22:35,264 --> 00:22:37,056
In terms of

444
00:22:37,312 --> 00:22:40,896
The secret space program in your understanding about what's going on

445
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:43,456
Has she ever talked to you about

446
00:22:43,712 --> 00:22:46,784
The current events such as what's going on in North Korea

447
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:55,744
You know I hear things and then I'll ask

448
00:22:56,768 --> 00:22:59,072
You know we were talking a lot about Syria

449
00:22:59,584 --> 00:23:03,936
Akitas on North Korea so I just

450
00:23:04,192 --> 00:23:04,960
Point Blank

451
00:23:05,728 --> 00:23:11,872
Is there something somebody that's guiding what's-his-name in North Korea and Hillside

452
00:23:15,712 --> 00:23:18,016
So just like Syria and Isis

453
00:23:18,528 --> 00:23:20,064
You have the reptoids

454
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,880
Stirring up trouble with the North Korean Daiso

455
00:23:30,304 --> 00:23:36,192
I love it when you say something crazy but then you use like a normal colloquialism you don't like

456
00:23:36,704 --> 00:23:39,264
All the reptoids are stirring up trouble

457
00:23:49,248 --> 00:23:53,600
Yeah

458
00:23:53,856 --> 00:23:55,648
Go to Theory as any I've heard

459
00:23:55,904 --> 00:23:58,208
I think

460
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,024
But amid this does

461
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,048
Lowe's

462
00:24:02,304 --> 00:24:05,376
That's what we talked about in the last Project Camelot episode

463
00:24:05,632 --> 00:24:08,704
About all these World sort of issues like

464
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:09,472
Iraq

465
00:24:10,496 --> 00:24:13,568
The Vietnam War they were about Stargate

466
00:24:13,824 --> 00:24:16,128
Places where human

467
00:24:16,384 --> 00:24:17,920
Can jump into alien world in Alien

468
00:24:18,176 --> 00:24:18,944
Can come here

469
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,224
And that's where like

470
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:20,992
Shitgate

471
00:24:21,248 --> 00:24:21,760
Messi

472
00:24:22,272 --> 00:24:25,344
I don't have clips that but part of the

473
00:24:26,368 --> 00:24:26,880
The premise

474
00:24:27,136 --> 00:24:29,184
He's there all the times that we end up bombing

475
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,976
Places because these bombs

476
00:24:31,232 --> 00:24:32,000
End up shot

477
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,304
Yes

478
00:24:34,816 --> 00:24:37,888
Juice Cubes you said the bomb because humans are trying to jump

479
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:38,912
Through and that's again

480
00:24:40,192 --> 00:24:41,472
Treaties or something like that

481
00:24:45,312 --> 00:24:46,592
Imagine if she asked mark

482
00:24:46,848 --> 00:24:47,872
Any question

483
00:24:48,384 --> 00:24:48,896
That involves

484
00:24:49,408 --> 00:24:51,712
Are the reptoids involved

485
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:55,552
I think I

486
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,856
I got less than blue book value for

487
00:24:58,112 --> 00:24:58,624
This used car

488
00:25:03,744 --> 00:25:06,816
My sources tell me the reptoids have been getting into used car dealers

489
00:25:09,632 --> 00:25:14,496
What's today

490
00:25:17,824 --> 00:25:18,336
About this

491
00:25:19,104 --> 00:25:21,408
Is there two groups that are being discussed

492
00:25:21,664 --> 00:25:26,016
That are very similar in name but they are different groups and they're actually

493
00:25:28,064 --> 00:25:29,600
No the reptilians

494
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:31,648
Umbrella term

495
00:25:34,208 --> 00:25:40,352
Target

496
00:25:40,864 --> 00:25:41,632
How many of the Raptors

497
00:25:42,656 --> 00:25:44,192
And the Raptors are good

498
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,800
The rapper

499
00:25:49,056 --> 00:25:49,568
What is a good

500
00:25:51,104 --> 00:25:52,384
Lily asked you questions

501
00:25:52,896 --> 00:25:53,664
I have

502
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:54,944
One of the Raptors

503
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,784
Fallen madly in love with one of the reptoids

504
00:25:59,552 --> 00:26:03,904
Will there will there be

505
00:26:04,672 --> 00:26:05,952
I don't know about

506
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:08,000
But I can tell you

507
00:26:09,792 --> 00:26:11,328
Still happy

508
00:26:14,912 --> 00:26:15,424
Okay

509
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:20,544
Whatever star-crossed lovers scenario may or may not exist

510
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,384
Are engaged

511
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,408
In creating

512
00:26:25,664 --> 00:26:26,176
Entertainment

513
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:41,280
You know I'm a really good military wife but your there's a lot of things that he does or know that I don't

514
00:26:41,536 --> 00:26:46,144
Don't know a lot of that is because he can't keep me safe but

515
00:26:46,656 --> 00:26:49,472
You know I know he

516
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:54,080
Watch movies like okay

517
00:26:54,336 --> 00:26:59,200
Jurassic World

518
00:27:08,416 --> 00:27:09,696
Weird names that are

519
00:27:09,952 --> 00:27:13,280
Cuban names and they're not really Malaysia name for the

520
00:27:13,536 --> 00:27:19,680
You can just tell a raptor has tried to get a come up with a human

521
00:27:26,336 --> 00:27:32,480
I don't really know how he knows what the Raptors might

522
00:27:32,736 --> 00:27:34,528
Ryder might not be up to but you know

523
00:27:35,296 --> 00:27:36,576
Apparently

524
00:27:40,416 --> 00:27:41,952
We're behind Jurassic World

525
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:51,680
Subway

526
00:27:51,936 --> 00:27:55,264
Yeah they're good they're capturing the world

527
00:27:55,520 --> 00:28:00,384
So now I believe everything

528
00:28:01,664 --> 00:28:04,992
Bitter clearly a Raptor truck.

529
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,856
I don't see how that is of a perfect

530
00:28:16,256 --> 00:28:20,096
Joe Anthony's like a sweet lady

531
00:28:20,352 --> 00:28:20,864
But like

532
00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:25,472
Fifty-year-old Maybe

533
00:28:25,728 --> 00:28:28,032
Old white lady

534
00:28:28,288 --> 00:28:29,312
There's no doubt about that

535
00:28:30,848 --> 00:28:31,616
For a lot of her life

536
00:28:31,872 --> 00:28:32,896
In

537
00:28:33,152 --> 00:28:34,432
Bay Area

538
00:28:34,688 --> 00:28:36,736
California

539
00:28:36,992 --> 00:28:40,064
Doesn't leave out there

540
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:44,672
About like what is or is not a different cultures

541
00:28:48,512 --> 00:28:50,560
Exmark raptors raptors

542
00:28:50,816 --> 00:28:51,584
Philly rappers

543
00:28:54,656 --> 00:29:00,032
She doesn't get how insensitive

544
00:29:00,288 --> 00:29:02,592
But at the same time it's better than

545
00:29:02,848 --> 00:29:04,384
All other names are dumb

546
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:05,408
More like

547
00:29:11,552 --> 00:29:12,576
Wait lady do you mean

548
00:29:13,088 --> 00:29:18,976
Any name that is in a white person's name is that basically what she saying

549
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:20,512
Too silly

550
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:21,792
It's crazy

551
00:29:22,304 --> 00:29:22,816
But

552
00:29:27,936 --> 00:29:31,264
Knowing what a Malaysian name is and at the same time

553
00:29:32,288 --> 00:29:34,080
Taking a Raptor

554
00:29:35,104 --> 00:29:35,616
Fantastic

555
00:29:37,152 --> 00:29:38,432
Carrie is not a great

556
00:29:43,552 --> 00:29:46,624
The interview

557
00:29:49,184 --> 00:29:50,208
If she's ever seen a wreck

558
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,000
That's a good question

559
00:29:52,256 --> 00:29:54,048
It seems like trouble

560
00:29:54,304 --> 00:29:56,352
But I'm just glad

561
00:29:57,376 --> 00:29:58,400
In terms of

562
00:29:58,912 --> 00:30:01,216
But the interaction with the Raptor

563
00:30:01,984 --> 00:30:08,128
Have you ever seen Raptor cuz he talks about they're going to be on tour here in this

564
00:30:08,384 --> 00:30:08,896
Address

565
00:30:09,152 --> 00:30:11,456
Jurassic World

566
00:30:11,968 --> 00:30:14,272
T-Rex world

567
00:30:14,528 --> 00:30:17,088
Yeah

568
00:30:17,344 --> 00:30:19,392
Actively hiding themselves

569
00:30:19,648 --> 00:30:21,184
The models are whatever

570
00:30:23,744 --> 00:30:25,536
Raptors in that show

571
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,656
Couple years back

572
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:33,984
Another big production

573
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:38,848
Dinosaur walking dinosaur

00:30:41,664 --> 00:30:44,224
Used to be called the Arco Arena open Sacramento

575

Going through history the dinosaur history through Through the Ages and

576
00:30:57,792 --> 00:31:03,936
Raptors in the Raptor suit

577
00:31:07,776 --> 00:31:08,800
Within Raptors

578
00:31:13,408 --> 00:31:14,944
So the Raptors

579
00:31:17,248 --> 00:31:17,760
Hiding

580
00:31:19,808 --> 00:31:21,088
By dressing up as rap

581
00:31:22,112 --> 00:31:23,904
Because nothing you would never see

582
00:31:30,816 --> 00:31:32,096
What she says it's like

583
00:31:32,608 --> 00:31:34,400
She knew there were 10

584
00:31:34,912 --> 00:31:39,776
Well they're probably nearby you know what I

585
00:31:40,032 --> 00:31:43,360
Out fake version

586
00:31:43,616 --> 00:31:48,480
I love the visual that is Joanne going to walk with the dinosaurs

587
00:31:48,736 --> 00:31:54,368
I like seeing I got Raptor suit and giving it a knowing nod

588
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:58,464
Call your card

589
00:31:58,720 --> 00:31:59,744
But I see you

590
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,048
Visual

591
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:03,840
Put on

592
00:32:04,096 --> 00:32:05,376
Chevy Tahoe

593
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:09,216
Let me be clear to

594
00:32:09,472 --> 00:32:10,752
They do discuss it

595
00:32:11,008 --> 00:32:12,032
We're not

596
00:32:12,288 --> 00:32:13,824
Misrepresenting what Raptors

597
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:17,664
Okay we are likely are the Raptors that you and I are

598
00:32:18,688 --> 00:32:19,456
But maybe it's

599
00:32:19,712 --> 00:32:22,272
Tiny bit smaller little

600
00:32:22,528 --> 00:32:23,552
Do they use their little hands

601
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:26,368
Does Dipper die

602
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:29,440
Speak like humans

603
00:32:29,696 --> 00:32:30,208
Yeah

604
00:32:30,464 --> 00:32:32,000
Better

605
00:32:32,256 --> 00:32:36,608
Taking human names also when Walking with Dinosaurs

606
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:39,424
Came around a few years back

607
00:32:39,936 --> 00:32:40,960
I was working a Groupon

608
00:32:41,216 --> 00:32:43,264
The time

609
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:45,568
And the sales rep that worked out that deal.

610
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:46,592
Come to our office

611
00:32:47,104 --> 00:32:49,408
It was pretty cool

612
00:32:49,664 --> 00:32:50,944
Same time

613
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:51,712
Terrifying

614
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:57,600
No I didn't I saw a bunch of people manipulating a puppet

615
00:33:00,416 --> 00:33:01,696
They weren't inside it

616
00:33:01,952 --> 00:33:02,464
Worthy

617
00:33:03,744 --> 00:33:04,256
Now this

618
00:33:04,768 --> 00:33:06,048
I'm just spitballing

619
00:33:06,816 --> 00:33:08,096
Were they Raptors

620
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:16,032
Will see that could be possible to discuss Raptors

621
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:24,224
I don't care

622
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:27,040
Why not

623
00:33:28,064 --> 00:33:29,088
Joann

624
00:33:31,904 --> 00:33:34,976
Joanna still has more thoughts about

625
00:33:35,232 --> 00:33:35,744
Christian rap

626
00:33:36,256 --> 00:33:38,560
Yes and the possibility of such a thing

627
00:33:40,096 --> 00:33:41,632
Couldn't tell that they were actually

628
00:33:41,888 --> 00:33:45,984
In the actor soup that day but I think they were probably hanging out nearby

629
00:33:46,496 --> 00:33:52,640
So you just never know

630
00:33:54,432 --> 00:34:00,576
We have these treaties where there's not supposed to be open communication with civilians.

631
00:34:01,088 --> 00:34:03,648
I really try not to be seen

632
00:34:04,928 --> 00:34:06,464
People

633
00:34:06,976 --> 00:34:07,744
Like

634
00:34:08,512 --> 00:34:14,656
Do you like to go to big conferences Comic-Con and science conferences work

635
00:34:14,912 --> 00:34:21,056
Lot of people are in costumes and a lot of different aliens do that bill either wear a hooded

636
00:34:23,616 --> 00:34:25,664
Look like they sit in butt

637
00:34:26,688 --> 00:34:32,320
Barbie's butt

638
00:34:32,576 --> 00:34:35,392
We can translate that also as I don't understand cause

639
00:34:35,648 --> 00:34:38,464
Comic-Con

640
00:34:39,488 --> 00:34:40,000
Received

641
00:34:40,256 --> 00:34:41,536
Aliens who want to hang out

642
00:34:41,792 --> 00:34:43,072
There

643
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:48,448
Costco

644
00:34:48,704 --> 00:34:49,984
Towers

645
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:50,752
Crafting a

646
00:34:51,008 --> 00:34:52,544
Labor of love

647
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:55,872
But they're not really getting much worse

648
00:34:56,128 --> 00:34:56,896
But come on

649
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,968
It's

650
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:06,624
Like that

651
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:08,928
Totally

652
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:11,232
Parsley

653
00:35:11,488 --> 00:35:12,512
Controlled by aliens because of

654
00:35:12,768 --> 00:35:14,560
The trees as the first

655
00:35:14,816 --> 00:35:16,352
The first thing to go she ate with aliens

656
00:35:16,608 --> 00:35:17,120
Does the trade deal

657
00:35:17,376 --> 00:35:20,448
These treaties by the way from The Phantom Menace

658
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:21,984
Mister Phantom Menace

659
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:24,544
Pixar never

660
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:27,360
Doug into at all we don't get any real

661
00:35:27,616 --> 00:35:31,456
Information about what went on in these treaties what the stipulations

662
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:32,992
It's just we got

663
00:35:35,552 --> 00:35:36,064
Treaties fact

664
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:39,392
So heavily into all discussions about

665
00:35:40,928 --> 00:35:46,816
Aliens from from like the Project Camelot stuff that I've heard it's always like

666
00:35:48,352 --> 00:35:50,400
Any fantasy world requires rule

667
00:35:51,168 --> 00:35:52,704
Because it have to be rules

668
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:53,472
In order to

669
00:35:53,728 --> 00:35:56,032
Explain the really big stuff that you can't

670
00:35:56,288 --> 00:35:59,616
Explain

671
00:36:00,128 --> 00:36:01,664
It's the same thing with like when you're trying

672
00:36:03,968 --> 00:36:06,528
What is a dragon

673
00:36:07,296 --> 00:36:08,832
Fantasy scenario you need that dungeon

674
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:12,160
Of what is the reality of the

675
00:36:12,672 --> 00:36:13,184
Change your on

676
00:36:13,696 --> 00:36:14,976
And basically that's what

677
00:36:15,232 --> 00:36:16,256
Project Camelot.

678
00:36:16,512 --> 00:36:20,096
How to play your Project Camelot but they're pretending it's real

679
00:36:20,352 --> 00:36:22,656
Can we play

680
00:36:22,912 --> 00:36:24,192
Pick characters from

681
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:27,520
Project Camelot at Royal Plaza

682
00:36:27,776 --> 00:36:31,104
I want to be that super soldier was on the last episode

683
00:36:35,968 --> 00:36:39,040
Skill is I'll ask my husband mark

684
00:36:39,552 --> 00:36:40,064
Raptors

685
00:36:41,344 --> 00:36:42,368
2 Raptor

686
00:36:45,184 --> 00:36:47,488
You can be carries

687
00:36:47,744 --> 00:36:49,536
Plus 3 charisma

688
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:51,328
Pictures of May

689
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:57,728
She doesn't perform lesser magic so this next clip

690
00:36:57,984 --> 00:36:58,752
Carrie

691
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:02,080
Quest

692
00:37:02,336 --> 00:37:04,384
Based on the conversation that she's had

693
00:37:05,664 --> 00:37:08,224
Talk to him a bit and we'll get to that the future

694
00:37:09,504 --> 00:37:13,344
She had conversation with him and wants to run it by Joanne

695
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:14,880
See what she has to say about it

696
00:37:15,136 --> 00:37:16,672
Headache

697
00:37:16,928 --> 00:37:17,440
This is

698
00:37:17,696 --> 00:37:18,464
What kind of question

699
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:21,792
Could be awkward but somehow ends up being

700
00:37:22,048 --> 00:37:25,376
Delightful

701
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:28,960
Mark married a wealthy

702
00:37:29,216 --> 00:37:32,544
She told me that he was married to a woman

703
00:37:33,056 --> 00:37:36,128
And that he had two kids please

704
00:37:39,712 --> 00:37:41,248
Number one

705
00:37:41,504 --> 00:37:45,088
I am another California are the only ones that he's been married to

706
00:37:45,344 --> 00:37:46,880
Partner

707
00:37:47,136 --> 00:37:48,160
He's had lots of

708
00:37:48,416 --> 00:37:48,928
Partners

709
00:37:49,696 --> 00:37:52,256
I know I know about 1

710
00:37:54,304 --> 00:37:56,864
And she was from the Aryan race

711
00:37:58,912 --> 00:38:03,008
Amen

712
00:38:03,264 --> 00:38:05,568
Nordic maybe I just remembered it as

713
00:38:05,824 --> 00:38:08,896
And so don't go

714
00:38:09,408 --> 00:38:15,040
Tell me about all the women in all the children

715
00:38:16,576 --> 00:38:19,392
There was a Nordic

716
00:38:19,648 --> 00:38:22,208
Princess who he does have a child

717
00:38:23,232 --> 00:38:25,024
Okay and the child is here on Earth

718
00:38:25,536 --> 00:38:30,144
Oh no something else out of their empire icy

719
00:38:34,496 --> 00:38:37,312
Mark is an intergalactic

720
00:38:39,104 --> 00:38:45,248
And how many children does asphalt is one of the kids out there with different

721
00:38:46,784 --> 00:38:50,624
Is going up there putting his dick in all sorts of aliens

722
00:38:52,672 --> 00:38:55,744
Mark may not necessarily be lying to her you know because

723
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,048
California doesn't recognize player

724
00:39:00,096 --> 00:39:01,120
Just

725
00:39:04,448 --> 00:39:04,960
Species alien

726
00:39:05,728 --> 00:39:11,872
I want I want before we unpack a stupid it is but he claims he has a kid with

727
00:39:12,128 --> 00:39:13,152
Printer data

728
00:39:14,432 --> 00:39:16,480
The reason that she

729
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:20,320
Empire

730
00:39:20,576 --> 00:39:23,392
Cassidy King

731
00:39:23,648 --> 00:39:26,208
Confused between pleiadian and ordinary

732
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:27,488
Is because

733
00:39:27,744 --> 00:39:30,560
Those are sort of humanoid light

734
00:39:31,072 --> 00:39:33,120
Elemental aliens

735
00:39:33,888 --> 00:39:37,472
Cuz there's that there's like The Reptilian umbrella and then there is this sort of

736
00:39:37,728 --> 00:39:38,496
Nordic

737
00:39:38,752 --> 00:39:39,264
Umbrella

738
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:41,568
And the Pleiadians are on that side of

739
00:39:42,336 --> 00:39:47,200
They're all humanoids look like humans where are the Raptors

740
00:39:48,224 --> 00:39:50,272
Yeah or there's a grey alien

741
00:39:50,528 --> 00:39:53,600
There's all sorts of

742
00:39:59,232 --> 00:40:01,280
Explain the pay will just

743
00:40:01,536 --> 00:40:04,608
Work for whoever the highest

744
00:40:04,864 --> 00:40:10,752
Oh yeah oh yeah how did it greatly exaggerated WWII they sided with the reptile

745
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:14,592
That guy said they're on the axis of Evil

746
00:40:14,848 --> 00:40:20,224
Germany Italy in

747
00:40:20,736 --> 00:40:22,528
Raptors we're on our way

748
00:40:22,784 --> 00:40:28,928
All of human history has really actually just been a battle between different alien races

749
00:40:29,184 --> 00:40:30,976
Avoid the pain of realizing that humans

750
00:40:31,232 --> 00:40:35,584
Heard of a beautiful singing This is it always humans

751
00:40:36,096 --> 00:40:38,144
As a whole are always the good guy

752
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:38,912
Yeah

753
00:40:39,168 --> 00:40:39,680
But

754
00:40:39,936 --> 00:40:42,240
Were manipulated by alien races

755
00:40:42,496 --> 00:40:45,056
Power is controlled by aliens

756
00:40:45,312 --> 00:40:48,896
All of this it's really all framed as a struggle of all of us

757
00:40:49,408 --> 00:40:49,920
Together

758
00:40:50,432 --> 00:40:52,224
Supposed to discovering

759
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:54,272
No truly will exist and it looks

760
00:40:54,528 --> 00:40:55,296
Like you and me

761
00:40:55,552 --> 00:40:56,832
Yeah it does not look like

762
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:58,624
A Raptor

763
00:41:02,208 --> 00:41:03,232
First of all the Joann

764
00:41:03,488 --> 00:41:04,768
Is totally cool

765
00:41:05,024 --> 00:41:05,792
With Mark

766
00:41:06,048 --> 00:41:08,096
Throwing it around everywhere

767
00:41:08,352 --> 00:41:08,864
He's got kids

768
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:11,424
He's got hoes in

769
00:41:11,936 --> 00:41:12,448
F******

770
00:41:13,472 --> 00:41:14,240
Star codes

771
00:41:14,496 --> 00:41:16,288
I don't know

772
00:41:16,544 --> 00:41:22,432
Same time she opened up her married if you guys ran around live the life

773
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:27,552
Jealousy is pointless to have anymore

774
00:41:29,600 --> 00:41:31,136
Play 18 kids

775
00:41:31,392 --> 00:41:32,160
Star system

776
00:41:32,416 --> 00:41:33,696
Absolutely

777
00:41:33,952 --> 00:41:35,232
In his next clip Joanna

778
00:41:35,488 --> 00:41:36,512
Expresses what her vision

779
00:41:38,048 --> 00:41:39,840
Cuz

780
00:41:40,096 --> 00:41:40,608
If Mark has

781
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:41,888
Express

782
00:41:42,144 --> 00:41:44,192
He thinks the future holds for them or whatever

783
00:41:47,008 --> 00:41:47,776
Future should have

784
00:41:48,544 --> 00:41:52,128
You know my vision and I'm very open about it it's like my vision

785
00:41:53,919 --> 00:42:00,063
Ideal properties and I didn't go visit if I found the ideal property online

786
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:01,343
When I was in Norfolk

787
00:42:03,903 --> 00:42:08,511
This beautiful old like in wardian house on five and a half acres

788
00:42:08,767 --> 00:42:12,607
Lots of fields at overlooking Fields got a horse Paddock

789
00:42:15,167 --> 00:42:19,775
Plenty around to Lansing gone and grow vegetables

790
00:42:20,031 --> 00:42:25,151
I want to go where all those alien friends can come visit all the grandchildren can come visit

791
00:42:25,663 --> 00:42:30,783
Everybody just has a grand time and we're just left alone to see

792
00:42:31,039 --> 00:42:32,831
Communicate

793
00:42:33,087 --> 00:42:35,135
Live happily ever after with our alien friends

794
00:42:41,023 --> 00:42:42,303
Innocent

795
00:42:42,559 --> 00:42:43,583
Beautiful

796
00:42:43,839 --> 00:42:46,655
It is kygo

797
00:42:46,911 --> 00:42:50,239
A place large enough

798
00:42:53,055 --> 00:42:54,847
Intermingle with our alien friends

799
00:42:56,383 --> 00:42:56,895
Antique

800
00:42:59,455 --> 00:43:01,759
Plant growth

801
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:05,087
Again

802
00:43:05,599 --> 00:43:07,391
And there's enough space for people

803
00:43:07,647 --> 00:43:09,439
There's an undercurrent of foolishness

804
00:43:09,695 --> 00:43:10,719
But at the same time

805
00:43:10,975 --> 00:43:12,255
Overwhelming

806
00:43:15,327 --> 00:43:17,631
Sweetness and foolishness mixed all into one

807
00:43:18,911 --> 00:43:19,423
So there's no

808
00:43:19,679 --> 00:43:20,191
Clip

809
00:43:20,447 --> 00:43:21,727
Jo-Ann's discusses

810
00:43:23,519 --> 00:43:24,799
I want

811
00:43:25,055 --> 00:43:25,823
But really

812
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:26,591
She discusses

813
00:43:27,103 --> 00:43:27,615
The Linea

814
00:43:28,127 --> 00:43:28,639
Did Mark

815
00:43:29,919 --> 00:43:32,223
When is youngest father side

816
00:43:33,247 --> 00:43:39,391
They're from Germany the Rhineland in Germany still at Jeff and

817
00:43:39,647 --> 00:43:40,159
Princess

818
00:43:43,231 --> 00:43:46,559
Generation away from being a German France

819
00:43:49,631 --> 00:43:52,959
Some very prominent

820
00:43:53,215 --> 00:43:54,239
British

821
00:43:54,495 --> 00:43:58,335
Damn ways I know he's from the Stuart line from peacock line

822
00:43:58,591 --> 00:44:00,895
On his mom's side

823
00:44:01,151 --> 00:44:02,687
You know there's definitely very

824
00:44:03,199 --> 00:44:05,247
Special Celtic bloodline

825
00:44:05,759 --> 00:44:06,527
And

826
00:44:06,783 --> 00:44:11,903
Related to William the first governor of

827
00:44:12,159 --> 00:44:13,695
I'm hoping it's Rhode Island

828
00:44:13,951 --> 00:44:16,255
If I remember correctly

829
00:44:17,023 --> 00:44:23,167
His grandparents were both involved with think-tanks and Nikola Tesla and local politics

830
00:44:24,191 --> 00:44:27,263
Grandpa Taylor on his mom's side was one of

831
00:44:27,775 --> 00:44:33,919
Teddy Roosevelt's Rough Riders and he was one of the original like Secret Service men in black fat people

832
00:44:34,175 --> 00:44:35,967
Sure of course

833
00:44:36,479 --> 00:44:37,247
Powerful

834
00:44:39,039 --> 00:44:40,831
There's a bad bloodline

835
00:44:41,343 --> 00:44:42,111
Anywhere

836
00:44:42,879 --> 00:44:46,719
You know I think his mom kept telling me and we're also related to Pocahontas

837
00:44:46,975 --> 00:44:53,119
Geology

838
00:44:55,935 --> 00:44:59,775
The family is out of NASA and the house of Orange

839
00:45:00,031 --> 00:45:06,175
Royal family

840
00:45:06,431 --> 00:45:07,967
Adjustment

841
00:45:08,223 --> 00:45:09,247
For that reason

842
00:45:09,503 --> 00:45:12,063
That just a little bit of fun trivia Mark's dad is called

843
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:12,831
The Dutchman

844
00:45:13,087 --> 00:45:16,927
The Dutchman

845
00:45:17,439 --> 00:45:18,975
Like I love any of the codename

846
00:45:19,231 --> 00:45:19,743
He's

847
00:45:19,999 --> 00:45:21,791
Supposedly like a

848
00:45:22,303 --> 00:45:28,447
Apparently went along on the Expedition with Admiral Byrd

849
00:45:28,703 --> 00:45:31,007
But I know he I know he went on the expedition

850
00:45:34,335 --> 00:45:35,359
Don't even finish the sentence

851
00:45:35,871 --> 00:45:37,407
I know that

852
00:45:38,175 --> 00:45:43,039
Production there is there's only one thing I know and that is

853
00:45:43,295 --> 00:45:45,599
Forrest Gump is based entirely on the Dutchman

854
00:45:48,415 --> 00:45:49,951
In the world

855
00:45:50,207 --> 00:45:50,719
Hendricks

856
00:45:50,975 --> 00:45:55,327
Dunking Dutchman

857
00:45:55,583 --> 00:45:59,423
If you don't know Admiral Byrd lies a gentleman

858
00:46:01,471 --> 00:46:03,775
May or may not have discovered that the Earth is Hollow

859
00:46:05,567 --> 00:46:11,711
He flew over the pole I remember that guy now

860
00:46:11,967 --> 00:46:12,479
Hollow Earth

861
00:46:12,735 --> 00:46:14,271
Subscribed

862
00:46:14,527 --> 00:46:16,063
The school of Admiral Byrd

863
00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:22,463
You can you can count at least among them John Quincy Adams my friend

864
00:46:22,719 --> 00:46:25,279
Hollow Earth

865
00:46:27,583 --> 00:46:30,143
The nail right on the head

866
00:46:30,655 --> 00:46:32,191
That means this is a man lying about

867
00:46:35,519 --> 00:46:39,103
Kind of sounds like Alex a little bit

868
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:42,175
I'm related to royalty

869
00:46:42,431 --> 00:46:43,199
Yeah

870
00:46:45,247 --> 00:46:46,527
Anytime somebody tells you about their

871
00:46:47,039 --> 00:46:47,551
Past lives

872
00:46:47,807 --> 00:46:48,319
It's always like

873
00:46:48,831 --> 00:46:52,671
In my past life I would Cleopatra

874
00:46:52,927 --> 00:46:56,767
If we're going to if we're even going to entertain past lives and all that s***

875
00:46:57,535 --> 00:47:00,095
Your past lives were mostly people who died at 2

876
00:47:00,351 --> 00:47:00,863
20 of dissing

877
00:47:01,375 --> 00:47:02,911
Like that's what your past lives are

878
00:47:04,959 --> 00:47:08,543
You know if you want to believe in past lives that's fine but most of your past lives

879
00:47:08,799 --> 00:47:09,567
Shut themselves

880
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:11,615
He was related to Pocahontas

881
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:21,343
He has a kid with a Nordic alien princess and he's only the

882
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:22,623
From being a German

883
00:47:24,159 --> 00:47:25,183
Part of the Stewart's

884
00:47:28,511 --> 00:47:30,815
Stewart Falls

885
00:47:31,327 --> 00:47:33,119
Yep

886
00:47:34,143 --> 00:47:40,287
I like I like that was Olympic clothes

887
00:47:40,543 --> 00:47:42,591
Nikola Tesla

888
00:47:42,847 --> 00:47:46,943
Mazda Tesla's in local politics

889
00:47:48,991 --> 00:47:49,759
Oxford,

890
00:47:51,551 --> 00:47:55,647
Get back to Jurassic World

891
00:47:55,903 --> 00:47:58,719
Jo-Ann's

892
00:48:03,583 --> 00:48:04,863
Was

893
00:48:05,119 --> 00:48:07,423
Mark when he was still in high school

894
00:48:07,935 --> 00:48:14,079
Went to England and with part of raptor military training they had a whole life

895
00:48:14,335 --> 00:48:17,151
Training facility at bamburgh Castle they were using

896
00:48:17,663 --> 00:48:21,759
At the time and he was part of their whole he and other human

897
00:48:22,015 --> 00:48:23,807
Dean Martin's son

898
00:48:24,063 --> 00:48:26,367
River Oaks

899
00:48:26,623 --> 00:48:30,463
National award game type

900
00:48:30,719 --> 00:48:34,303
Actual Rescue Mission

901
00:48:34,559 --> 00:48:40,703
Angela Ballard

902
00:48:40,959 --> 00:48:47,103
A talking more about the Raptors and how in this scene in Jurassic World

903
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:49,919
Motorcycle racing along with the Raptors

904
00:48:50,175 --> 00:48:52,991
Markings that guy I have the leather jacket

905
00:48:53,247 --> 00:48:59,135
He did races motorcycles with the Raptors when they were running and training himself.

906
00:48:59,391 --> 00:49:02,719
It's kind of funny how the movie parallels my sleep

907
00:49:04,767 --> 00:49:05,791
You could call itsfunneh

908
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:08,095
Call suspicious Joy

909
00:49:08,351 --> 00:49:08,863
Joann

910
00:49:09,631 --> 00:49:13,215
I'm at the point now where I halfway believe that Mark isn't even real

911
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:20,895
Much b*******

912
00:49:21,919 --> 00:49:22,943
Nope time question

913
00:49:23,199 --> 00:49:24,479
Why is she giving talk

914
00:49:24,735 --> 00:49:30,879
And to whom she goes to like UFO conventions and stuff like that she goes around to be place

915
00:49:31,391 --> 00:49:34,719
Probably Move On lyrics the custom on the last episode

916
00:49:34,975 --> 00:49:36,255
Just better at telling mark

917
00:49:36,511 --> 00:49:37,535
Flies to people

918
00:49:38,047 --> 00:49:40,095
Mike is really good at telling lies

919
00:49:43,423 --> 00:49:45,471
Commence fill-in-the-blank

920
00:49:46,239 --> 00:49:46,751
Yes she is

921
00:49:47,263 --> 00:49:47,775
She's very sweet

922
00:49:48,287 --> 00:49:49,055
October

923
00:49:49,311 --> 00:49:52,895
To her proof I want to sit down with her and advised her to leave

924
00:49:53,151 --> 00:49:56,479
I don't think you'd be able to 40 45 years

925
00:49:56,735 --> 00:49:59,551
If Marcus got her believe in that he

926
00:49:59,807 --> 00:50:03,135
Raptor army training camp while he's in jail

927
00:50:07,487 --> 00:50:12,095
So many lies have just gotten so far out of control Mark is just

928
00:50:18,751 --> 00:50:20,799
Are proof Villa sells production

929
00:50:21,055 --> 00:50:22,847
He is throwing everything in the kitchen sink

930
00:50:23,871 --> 00:50:26,431
But her proof is that she has the leather jacket

931
00:50:26,687 --> 00:50:30,271
Motorcycle

932
00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:33,855
But remember in the

933
00:50:34,111 --> 00:50:35,903
At the end whenever they were like

934
00:50:36,159 --> 00:50:36,671
It's not real

935
00:50:36,927 --> 00:50:37,439
Then there was

936
00:50:37,695 --> 00:50:38,463
24-hours

937
00:50:40,255 --> 00:50:40,767
That proves

938
00:50:41,023 --> 00:50:41,535
The Jodie Foster

939
00:50:41,791 --> 00:50:42,559
Alien

940
00:50:44,607 --> 00:50:49,727
They open it up she also could have brought back a leather jacket

941
00:50:51,263 --> 00:50:52,543
You might hurt typing there

942
00:50:52,799 --> 00:50:56,383
Siri is also on the live chat

943
00:50:56,895 --> 00:51:03,039
There are people

944
00:51:03,295 --> 00:51:08,671
Later towards the end

945
00:51:09,183 --> 00:51:09,951
No staff

946
00:51:10,463 --> 00:51:13,791
Your husband I've no idea

947
00:51:14,303 --> 00:51:20,447
A little bit later you do hear him yell stuff for a month

948
00:51:22,239 --> 00:51:24,287
Towards the end of this interview

949
00:51:25,311 --> 00:51:27,103
No she forgets the name Stephen Hawking

950
00:51:29,919 --> 00:51:33,503
Get ready for that do you know why he doesn't

951
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:38,879
Even in the world

952
00:51:41,695 --> 00:51:42,207
Bingo

953
00:51:42,463 --> 00:51:44,511
So they open it up to the chat and they take some

954
00:51:44,767 --> 00:51:45,279
Some questions

955
00:51:47,071 --> 00:51:48,351
Why is 30 proof

956
00:51:48,863 --> 00:51:50,399
Are there and they get

957
00:51:50,655 --> 00:51:51,167
F******

958
00:51:51,679 --> 00:51:52,447
Murderously angry

959
00:51:53,727 --> 00:51:54,751
Bigot

960
00:51:55,263 --> 00:51:56,287
How would I describe it

961
00:51:56,799 --> 00:51:57,823
Pick their Plumbing

962
00:51:59,359 --> 00:52:00,639
Why would

963
00:52:10,367 --> 00:52:13,695
Question for me to believe they're asking but none was

964
00:52:14,207 --> 00:52:15,743
Why isn't there any hard

965
00:52:21,375 --> 00:52:25,727
Of that you know alien visitation to Earth I guess this what they're trying to say

966
00:52:29,823 --> 00:52:33,151
If you can get into the Vatican archives there's plenty of proof

967
00:52:33,919 --> 00:52:35,199
Screw

968
00:52:35,455 --> 00:52:36,991
Great that is true

969
00:52:37,503 --> 00:52:38,527
That's the only

970
00:52:38,783 --> 00:52:40,575
Is breaking

971
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:43,647
Stuff works is like

972
00:52:46,719 --> 00:52:49,791
No Treasure 3 that's what we're writing right now

973
00:52:50,815 --> 00:52:52,607
What playing with the Raptor

974
00:52:53,119 --> 00:52:54,911
All that be great I do you want some

975
00:52:55,935 --> 00:52:56,447
To be a rapper

976
00:52:57,983 --> 00:52:59,775
Splices jeans with raptor jeans

977
00:53:00,031 --> 00:53:05,663
Break into the secret archives of the Vatican

978
00:53:06,175 --> 00:53:09,247
This is what they do that sort of

979
00:53:09,759 --> 00:53:15,903
The game along with creating rules for your fictional reality you'll never be able to get to

980
00:53:16,415 --> 00:53:17,439
That's how it always is

981
00:53:17,695 --> 00:53:21,023
Have to work almost always

982
00:53:21,279 --> 00:53:22,047
It's in the Vatican

983
00:53:22,303 --> 00:53:27,935
Somewhere was in the Library of Alexandria

984
00:53:28,191 --> 00:53:30,751
You know the Masons or the

985
00:53:31,007 --> 00:53:31,775
Who was it

986
00:53:32,031 --> 00:53:33,055
Who are the

987
00:53:33,311 --> 00:53:39,455
The Visigoths which one was the Library of Alexandria

988
00:53:39,711 --> 00:53:44,063
Different waves

989
00:53:44,319 --> 00:53:45,087
Fascinating story

990
00:53:45,343 --> 00:53:46,623
The Library of Alexandria

991
00:53:47,903 --> 00:53:50,719
Just that's really the only issue

992
00:53:51,231 --> 00:53:51,743
Do people have

993
00:53:52,255 --> 00:53:54,303
Shrinking it down nobody wanted to pay for it

994
00:53:54,559 --> 00:53:56,607
You know why

995
00:53:56,863 --> 00:53:57,375
Print x y

996
00:53:57,631 --> 00:53:58,143
Cuz of Finance

997
00:53:58,399 --> 00:54:01,215
Pressures caused by the reptile

998
00:54:01,471 --> 00:54:01,983
Yep

999
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:08,127
Alright Templar

1000
00:54:08,383 --> 00:54:12,991
From the Library of Alexandria by the Knights Templar

1001
00:54:13,247 --> 00:54:17,087
80 kind of thing

1002
00:54:17,343 --> 00:54:18,623
Talking about nonsense

1003
00:54:18,879 --> 00:54:21,695
Vent filter point the point is if we're going to have rules

1004
00:54:21,951 --> 00:54:23,231
We don't have any rules

1005
00:54:23,743 --> 00:54:27,583
Jo-Ann's interview

1006
00:54:28,095 --> 00:54:28,607
She talked

1007
00:54:30,655 --> 00:54:33,471
It's so it's so mind-boggling

1008
00:54:33,983 --> 00:54:34,495
I just left

1009
00:54:35,007 --> 00:54:35,775
Is love there

1010
00:54:37,567 --> 00:54:39,103
This is a hard question to ask

1011
00:54:39,615 --> 00:54:41,407
Why isn't there any hard proof

1012
00:54:41,919 --> 00:54:47,039
And you're like why is that a hard question for you to ask

1013
00:54:47,295 --> 00:54:48,319
Cement

1014
00:54:52,927 --> 00:54:55,743
Like they didn't occur that never occurred

1015
00:54:55,999 --> 00:55:02,143
To them that you should require some sort of hard proof after that goes on to say about the stuff about

1016
00:55:04,447 --> 00:55:06,495
Puma punku in like ancient

1017
00:55:06,751 --> 00:55:07,775
Some stuff like that

1018
00:55:12,639 --> 00:55:14,175
Zachariah stitching

1019
00:55:14,943 --> 00:55:15,711
Those books

1020
00:55:21,343 --> 00:55:23,647
Sing that you probably haven't read

1021
00:55:23,903 --> 00:55:25,439
And if you have read it

1022
00:55:26,207 --> 00:55:26,719
You didn't

1023
00:55:28,511 --> 00:55:29,279
When you read it

1024
00:55:30,047 --> 00:55:31,839
You realize it doesn't say any of what they say it

1025
00:55:32,607 --> 00:55:35,423
No I mean zecharia sitchin books

1026
00:55:37,471 --> 00:55:43,615
For you

1027
00:55:43,871 --> 00:55:45,407
Right

1028
00:55:46,175 --> 00:55:47,199
That nobody's read

1029
00:55:47,455 --> 00:55:53,599
Erich von daniken all the way around

1030
00:55:53,855 --> 00:55:55,647
Turtles all the way down

1031
00:56:01,279 --> 00:56:02,815
That's why

1032
00:56:04,863 --> 00:56:07,679
Switch Raptors for Angels

1033
00:56:07,935 --> 00:56:08,447
Figured it out

1034
00:56:08,703 --> 00:56:09,471
Angels do play in

1035
00:56:10,751 --> 00:56:12,799
I didn't realize

1036
00:56:14,335 --> 00:56:14,847
Disconnect

1037
00:56:15,103 --> 00:56:17,919
Is the last of Jo-Ann's interview

1038
00:56:18,175 --> 00:56:18,943
Is a mic down

1039
00:56:19,967 --> 00:56:22,015
Interrupting

1040
00:56:23,039 --> 00:56:24,831
I don't know baby

1041
00:56:31,999 --> 00:56:35,071
She starts by talking a little bit about the Dutchman

1042
00:56:37,119 --> 00:56:37,887
Things get a little weird

1043
00:56:38,655 --> 00:56:43,007
We're while we were publicly at Cold War when there was a threat to the planet

1044
00:56:44,287 --> 00:56:46,335
Several countries came together and work

1045
00:56:46,591 --> 00:56:48,383
Together to save Humanity

1046
00:56:48,895 --> 00:56:52,991
Charge of that.

1047
00:56:53,503 --> 00:56:56,319
He was active behind the scenes

1048
00:57:00,671 --> 00:57:02,207
Do you know why

1049
00:57:02,463 --> 00:57:07,071
You seem to be a person of note and somebody who

1050
00:57:09,375 --> 00:57:12,959
He was unable to get Mark out of prison

1051
00:57:13,983 --> 00:57:14,751
Marshalls

1052
00:57:16,031 --> 00:57:20,383
Mark was off on a mission the day that murder happen

1053
00:57:20,639 --> 00:57:22,687
Tell me

1054
00:57:23,199 --> 00:57:29,087
Because I figured that much out and he can't tell me where he was or who he was with

1055
00:57:29,599 --> 00:57:35,743
And those people can't come forward and say this is what he was with that that day

1056
00:57:35,999 --> 00:57:40,351
Government military is not going to say oh he was working for us

1057
00:57:40,607 --> 00:57:45,215
Because then they would have to say what top-secret thing they were working on

1058
00:57:46,751 --> 00:57:50,591
Point Blank told him you're not going to break your oath

1059
00:57:54,687 --> 00:57:59,295
You're not going to break your military up until the top-secret we were doing

1060
00:57:59,807 --> 00:58:01,599
Even if it means that would save your life

1061
00:58:03,647 --> 00:58:05,439
It's like you know what your duty is

1062
00:58:05,695 --> 00:58:07,487
And your duty is to keep quiet

1063
00:58:08,511 --> 00:58:09,279
Okay

1064
00:58:09,535 --> 00:58:11,327
I also thought

1065
00:58:11,583 --> 00:58:13,887
At the time

1066
00:58:14,143 --> 00:58:16,703
Was it really good lawyer he was a well-known lawyer

1067
00:58:27,199 --> 00:58:33,343
Carly has a family going along thinking oh they're doing okay he's going to get him off and whatever

1068
00:58:33,599 --> 00:58:34,111
Ever and he did

1069
00:58:45,119 --> 00:58:46,655
Get Mark out of their hair

1070
00:58:46,911 --> 00:58:48,959
Freaking out

1071
00:58:49,983 --> 00:58:51,007
What did Mark do

1072
00:58:51,519 --> 00:58:57,663
Mercury guy Mark 100% killed somebody

1073
00:58:58,943 --> 00:59:05,087
This whole thing is just created by the entire

1074
00:59:05,343 --> 00:59:08,415
Emily in order to avoid dealing with the murderer

1075
00:59:10,719 --> 00:59:11,487
Onboard event

1076
00:59:11,743 --> 00:59:14,047
But what about the Dutchman

1077
00:59:15,071 --> 00:59:16,095
Only

1078
00:59:16,351 --> 00:59:16,863
Before

1079
00:59:17,375 --> 00:59:18,143
Joanne Matt

1080
00:59:19,167 --> 00:59:19,679
Gotcha

1081
00:59:22,495 --> 00:59:26,079
Mark Richards

1082
00:59:26,847 --> 00:59:27,615
With the

1083
00:59:29,663 --> 00:59:30,687
Iggy put your honor

1084
00:59:30,943 --> 00:59:34,783
This was the reason they were mad at the the lawyer they were like

1085
00:59:36,063 --> 00:59:37,087
You're not objecting

1086
00:59:37,343 --> 00:59:38,111
He was off

1087
00:59:38,367 --> 00:59:41,951
Planet idiot of course that witnessed in Co

1088
00:59:42,207 --> 00:59:44,511
Gotcha are you familiar with the

1089
00:59:44,767 --> 00:59:46,303
Pendragon murder plot

1090
00:59:47,583 --> 00:59:51,423
I am familiar with any number of them I didn't know any of them

1091
00:59:51,679 --> 00:59:54,239
This is a very first murder

1092
00:59:54,495 --> 00:59:55,775
From 1982

1093
00:59:56,031 --> 00:59:57,823
Marin County California

1094
00:59:58,079 --> 00:59:58,591
Okay

1095
00:59:58,847 --> 01:00:00,639
This was a situation

1096
01:00:02,175 --> 01:00:02,687
Was

1097
01:00:02,943 --> 01:00:04,223
He ran like a

1098
01:00:04,479 --> 01:00:05,247
Construction type

1099
01:00:05,503 --> 01:00:06,783
Crew or something along those lines

1100
01:00:07,039 --> 01:00:08,575
Really sure of all the details

1101
01:00:09,087 --> 01:00:10,367
But he had

1102
01:00:11,391 --> 01:00:11,903
Employee

1103
01:00:12,415 --> 01:00:13,951
217 year old employees

1104
01:00:14,207 --> 01:00:15,231
He was 19 at the

1105
01:00:15,743 --> 01:00:16,255
Or 29

1106
01:00:17,023 --> 01:00:18,559
Okay I was going to say that's a very

1107
01:00:22,911 --> 01:00:25,215
His name is

1108
01:00:26,495 --> 01:00:27,519
Richard Baldwin

1109
01:00:28,031 --> 01:00:30,079
He was a guy who ran like a car deal

1110
01:00:31,103 --> 01:00:31,615
Resort

1111
01:00:33,663 --> 01:00:34,943
He apparently owed

1112
01:00:35,199 --> 01:00:36,223
Mark's the money

1113
01:00:36,991 --> 01:00:38,015
Mark

1114
01:00:38,527 --> 01:00:39,551
I got

1115
01:00:39,807 --> 01:00:42,111
117 year olds

1116
01:00:44,927 --> 01:00:50,047
Okay he promised the seventeen-year-old that he would pay him $5,000 and give him a car

1117
01:00:51,583 --> 01:00:52,095
Kid murdered

1118
01:00:52,607 --> 01:00:55,935
Had immediately started bragging about it and talking about it

1119
01:00:56,191 --> 01:00:56,959
And they all got

1120
01:00:57,983 --> 01:01:00,031
It's very clear

1121
01:01:00,287 --> 01:01:02,335
That Mark is very guilty of this

1122
01:01:03,871 --> 01:01:04,383
WhatsApp

1123
01:01:04,639 --> 01:01:05,663
The Pendragon part of it

1124
01:01:06,175 --> 01:01:06,943
Comes from

1125
01:01:09,759 --> 01:01:10,783
Mark they searched his house

1126
01:01:11,295 --> 01:01:12,063
And they found

1127
01:01:12,575 --> 01:01:13,343
That he had

1128
01:01:13,599 --> 01:01:15,391
Plan to take over Marin County

1129
01:01:16,415 --> 01:01:22,559
I don't want to go super in detail about this because I've never wanted you to do anything else

1130
01:01:22,815 --> 01:01:25,119
Remind everyone

1131
01:01:25,375 --> 01:01:28,447
Cuz they covered this in detail on an episode of the dollop

1132
01:01:28,703 --> 01:01:30,751
No s*** this is that guy

1133
01:01:33,311 --> 01:01:34,079
She is disguise

1134
01:01:38,431 --> 01:01:39,199
Alright

1135
01:01:39,455 --> 01:01:42,527
So if you go and listen to the version

1136
01:01:42,783 --> 01:01:43,807
Just the facts

1137
01:01:45,087 --> 01:01:46,111
They found plans

1138
01:01:47,391 --> 01:01:48,159
Creating lasers

1139
01:01:48,415 --> 01:01:49,183
That would

1140
01:01:49,439 --> 01:01:50,975
Keep Marin County safe

1141
01:01:52,255 --> 01:01:55,071
They have destroyed the Golden Gate Bridge and another Bridge

1142
01:01:55,327 --> 01:01:58,655
They could isolate Marin County

1143
01:01:58,911 --> 01:01:59,679
Where Mark Richard

1144
01:01:59,935 --> 01:02:01,727
Would be basically King Arthur

1145
01:02:01,983 --> 01:02:03,775
Have his own dominion

1146
01:02:04,287 --> 01:02:05,311
Do you trick these kids

1147
01:02:05,567 --> 01:02:06,079
Into

1148
01:02:06,591 --> 01:02:08,127
Sort of going along with him

1149
01:02:08,383 --> 01:02:11,199
He was able to pay one of them to murder a guy

1150
01:02:11,711 --> 01:02:16,319
And I mean I did steal a bunch of s*** from him they still like a huge bag of weed

1151
01:02:16,575 --> 01:02:17,343
Bunch of money in a

1152
01:02:17,599 --> 01:02:20,159
Stay Puft

1153
01:02:22,975 --> 01:02:26,047
Murder

1154
01:02:27,583 --> 01:02:28,095
Do you have

1155
01:02:30,655 --> 01:02:32,191
17 that's not

1156
01:02:32,959 --> 01:02:37,567
No.29 murder planning

1157
01:02:37,823 --> 01:02:39,103
You're right

1158
01:02:39,359 --> 01:02:43,455
Yeah but I guess it was my TV shows

1159
01:02:46,271 --> 01:02:49,855
Also you should know that Mark

1160
01:02:50,367 --> 01:02:51,903
Herds of people not to take plane

1161
01:02:52,415 --> 01:02:54,463
Because the replicant

1162
01:02:54,719 --> 01:02:57,023
Absolute commercial plane

1163
01:02:57,279 --> 01:02:58,559
Never forget Reptoid

1164
01:03:00,351 --> 01:03:01,631
Mark is doing a bid

1165
01:03:01,887 --> 01:03:02,655
For murder

1166
01:03:04,447 --> 01:03:08,031
Has life-without-parole Jamarcus still in jail

1167
01:03:09,311 --> 01:03:11,103
God I love it

1168
01:03:11,359 --> 01:03:13,663
The whole time

1169
01:03:13,919 --> 01:03:16,735
Mark is in jail

1170
01:03:17,247 --> 01:03:19,551
That's why Joanna giving talk

1171
01:03:20,063 --> 01:03:22,879
Because Mark is in jail till forever

1172
01:03:23,135 --> 01:03:25,695
Forever

1173
01:03:25,951 --> 01:03:32,095
So hard to not take my hand

1174
01:03:37,983 --> 01:03:42,335
And more interesting more interesting to look at is the end

1175
01:03:42,591 --> 01:03:44,127
Tiertime Jo-Ann's known him

1176
01:03:44,383 --> 01:03:46,687
You've been in prison for murder

1177
01:03:52,831 --> 01:03:56,927

1178
01:03:57,439 --> 01:03:58,207
Gotcha

The perfect man

1180
01:04:04,095 --> 01:04:04,607
That is

1181
01:04:05,887 --> 01:04:06,399

His wife

1192
01:04:38,655 --> 01:04:40,447
Pictures of Benaiah

1193
01:04:41,983 --> 01:04:43,775
So long as she never actually

01:04:44,287 --> 01:04:46,847
Meet sent like the longest he's never living with her

1195
01:04:52,479 --> 01:04:53,503
He's under control

1196
01:04:54,015 --> 01:04:58,623
As long as they're not allowed out

1197
01:04:59,647 --> 01:05:02,463
I know I guess though

1198
01:05:02,975 --> 01:05:05,279
Break

1199
01:05:05,535 --> 01:05:06,815
Bet she's been

1200
01:05:07,071 --> 01:05:12,447
She's been given an Avenue where she can Retreat into a Fantasy Life

1201
01:05:12,703 --> 01:05:14,751
Before

1202
01:05:19,103 --> 01:05:19,615
Empathy for her

1203
01:05:20,639 --> 01:05:24,223
Her life has been a disaster like in the early 90s

1204
01:05:24,479 --> 01:05:26,527
He's never cheated with him in prison

1205
01:05:26,783 --> 01:05:29,855
Did you running from something she's found it in rap

1206
01:05:31,391 --> 01:05:33,439
Perfect she seems like she's doing great

1207
01:05:33,695 --> 01:05:34,975

1212
01:05:43,423 --> 01:05:44,191
Distance when I ever will

1213
01:05:44,447 --> 01:05:47,519
She makes a decent amount of coin going around telling his story

1214
01:05:48,543 --> 01:05:54,687
Great Castle in London or England

1215
01:05:55,199 --> 01:05:57,247
Right

1216
01:05:57,503 --> 01:06:00,319
Mark is not allowed out of the country

1217
01:06:00,575 --> 01:06:01,343
Good luck mark

1218
01:06:03,647 --> 01:06:04,927
Beyond in that last

1219
01:06:05,183 --> 01:06:07,999
Equip you heard like he wasn't even there

1220
01:06:08,511 --> 01:06:09,791
He was

1221
01:06:10,047 --> 01:06:12,351
He was for sure

1222
01:06:12,863 --> 01:06:15,935
But DIY

1223
01:06:16,191 --> 01:06:17,471
Ginger carry is

1224
01:06:18,495 --> 01:06:19,007
So if

1225
01:06:19,263 --> 01:06:19,775
You know

1226
01:06:20,031 --> 01:06:21,055
The Dutchman was

1227
01:06:21,567 --> 01:06:23,359
Basically the leader of the entire world

1228
01:06:23,615 --> 01:06:24,127
Defense

1229
01:06:24,639 --> 01:06:27,455
The Cold War

1230
01:06:27,711 --> 01:06:29,247
Important man on the planet

1231
01:06:30,015 --> 01:06:30,527
Why couldn't he

1232
01:06:30,783 --> 01:06:31,551
He get mark off

1233
01:06:37,951 --> 01:06:40,767
Not tell the truth

1234
01:06:41,023 --> 01:06:47,167
You know expose things before it's time to expose the disclosure of off Coral missions

1235
01:06:47,423 --> 01:06:48,447
Like that

1236
01:06:49,471 --> 01:06:50,495
Is making a heroic sac

1237
01:06:52,799 --> 01:06:55,103
The engineer of the worst murder ever committed

1238
01:06:56,127 --> 01:06:56,895
It's one of the worst

1239
01:06:57,151 --> 01:06:59,199
It's pretty it's minutes

1240
01:06:59,455 --> 01:07:00,223
Floppy

1241
01:07:00,479 --> 01:07:03,039
Yeah that'll

1242
01:07:05,599 --> 01:07:07,391
It started with a baseball bat

1243
01:07:07,647 --> 01:07:10,719
The screwdriver

1244
01:07:11,999 --> 01:07:14,559
Dispose of the body really terribly

1245
01:07:16,095 --> 01:07:16,607
Anyway who cares

1246
01:07:20,447 --> 01:07:23,519
Did not stink

1247
01:07:25,311 --> 01:07:25,823
Give me

1248
01:07:26,079 --> 01:07:27,103
It's in the water

1249
01:07:27,871 --> 01:07:30,943
No one will ever know or national Waters

1250
01:07:31,199 --> 01:07:34,783
Taxation is a crime blotter

1251
01:07:35,039 --> 01:07:37,087
It's like HomeBase

1252
01:07:38,623 --> 01:07:39,903
This is not worthy episode

1253
01:07:41,695 --> 01:07:42,719
Or episode 10

1254
01:07:43,487 --> 01:07:45,023
Because you should know that

1255
01:07:45,279 --> 01:07:45,791
Callahan

1256
01:07:46,047 --> 01:07:46,559
Cassidy

1257
01:07:46,815 --> 01:07:49,375
Yeah. We're never going to know how to get that right

1258
01:07:49,887 --> 01:07:51,935
Has gone to interview Mark in prison

1259
01:07:54,239 --> 01:07:56,799
6 *

1260
01:08:13,183 --> 01:08:19,327
Oh yeah

1261
01:08:19,583 --> 01:08:20,095
The twist

1262
01:08:21,631 --> 01:08:22,911
I don't know anything about Raptors

1263
01:08:24,959 --> 01:08:28,031
Smooth

1264
01:08:28,799 --> 01:08:33,151
So whenever Kerry Cassidy goes.

1265
01:08:33,407 --> 01:08:33,919
Every time

1266
01:08:34,175 --> 01:08:35,199
So whatever Carrie ghost

1267
01:08:35,455 --> 01:08:35,967
To visit

1268
01:08:36,223 --> 01:08:37,503
Because he's a murderer

1269
01:08:38,015 --> 01:08:39,039
He's under

1270
01:08:39,295 --> 01:08:40,319
Supervision

1271
01:08:40,575 --> 01:08:41,343
Decree privileges

1272
01:08:45,439 --> 01:08:46,975
They won't let her record him

1273
01:08:47,487 --> 01:08:49,791
So all she can do is take notes

1274
01:08:51,583 --> 01:08:52,607
Pencil but not a pen

1275
01:08:53,119 --> 01:08:54,655
Which brings up every time

1276
01:08:55,167 --> 01:09:00,031
Every one of these interviews

1277
01:09:00,287 --> 01:09:01,055
So then

1278
01:09:04,127 --> 01:09:05,151
Conversation

1279
01:09:05,407 --> 01:09:06,175
She takes note

1280
01:09:06,687 --> 01:09:08,479
Emmet makes a video where she reports

1281
01:09:08,735 --> 01:09:09,247
What's on the Note

1282
01:09:09,503 --> 01:09:14,879
Axle video hear of her reporting

1283
01:09:15,647 --> 01:09:17,183
I don't think

1284
01:09:20,511 --> 01:09:22,303
F*** I look everybody converter

1285
01:09:22,559 --> 01:09:24,863
Raptors versus

1286
01:09:26,655 --> 01:09:28,703
Ethereal Nordic

1287
01:09:28,959 --> 01:09:31,263
And also having multiple children off-planet

1288
01:09:31,519 --> 01:09:33,567
Sure it gets Wilder

1289
01:09:34,079 --> 01:09:35,871
I understand Joann

1290
01:09:36,127 --> 01:09:38,175
Motivation for believing Hook Line

1291
01:09:38,431 --> 01:09:41,247
And sinker everything this con man is telling her

1292
01:09:41,503 --> 01:09:46,111
I don't understand why Carrie isn't a little bit more dubious

1293
01:09:46,623 --> 01:09:51,999
I don't understand what you're talking to the most credulous person in the history of the world

1294
01:09:53,535 --> 01:09:54,303
Cassidy

1295
01:09:54,815 --> 01:09:56,863
To walk into a conversation with

1296
01:09:58,143 --> 01:09:59,679
I don't know if that is possible

1297
01:10:00,447 --> 01:10:06,591
I am asking her to realize that this guy murderer who's lying to people

1298
01:10:07,103 --> 01:10:07,871
I'm just be

1299
01:10:08,127 --> 01:10:10,175
If you want to if you want to believe that

1300
01:10:11,455 --> 01:10:11,967
Wrestle with

1301
01:10:12,735 --> 01:10:15,807
I recognize that it's you know

1302
01:10:16,063 --> 01:10:17,855
His credibility is a little thin

1303
01:10:24,767 --> 01:10:30,911
Right but if you know

1304
01:10:33,215 --> 01:10:38,591
A plan to create King Arthur's Court in Marin County by blowing up Bridges and giving a laser

1305
01:10:38,847 --> 01:10:42,687
Planted on him by the Riptides That's a classic reptile

1306
01:10:43,199 --> 01:10:43,967
Well

1307
01:10:47,295 --> 01:10:47,807
Classic

1308
01:10:48,063 --> 01:10:53,439
Classic restaurant unfortunately because they know that everyone else knows.

1309
01:10:54,975 --> 01:10:56,255
Right

1310
01:10:59,071 --> 01:11:03,423
To try to make up a human named dude you're totally right.

1311
01:11:03,679 --> 01:11:05,727
I don't know why they need

1312
01:11:08,543 --> 01:11:09,055
Anyways

1313
01:11:10,591 --> 01:11:11,871
Evidence on murder

1314
01:11:12,383 --> 01:11:18,527
Unfortunately they never really get into the details of the Pendragon

1315
01:11:21,855 --> 01:11:23,647
They know if they did they'd be like

1316
01:11:23,903 --> 01:11:24,415
Weak attic

1317
01:11:27,487 --> 01:11:31,071
I would love to see what they would do I'd love to see them dance around

1318
01:11:32,351 --> 01:11:33,631
Well now

1319
01:11:33,887 --> 01:11:37,471
Little bit

1320
01:11:37,727 --> 01:11:38,495
That's fine

1321
01:11:39,007 --> 01:11:39,519
Going to get like

1322
01:11:42,079 --> 01:11:43,359
17 year olds that

1323
01:11:44,383 --> 01:11:45,663
Indoctrinated into his

1324
01:11:46,175 --> 01:11:46,687
Port of

1325
01:11:46,943 --> 01:11:48,223
King Arthur's Court

1326
01:11:50,271 --> 01:11:51,039
How do you how do you

1327
01:11:51,295 --> 01:11:52,063
Respond to that

1328
01:11:54,111 --> 01:11:54,879
Okay

1329
01:11:55,135 --> 01:11:59,487
Well actually

1330
01:11:59,743 --> 01:12:01,279
His dad

1331
01:12:05,119 --> 01:12:05,631
Translate

1332
01:12:06,143 --> 01:12:07,935
Wow and in order to do that

1333
01:12:08,959 --> 01:12:09,471
The Cold War

1334
01:12:09,727 --> 01:12:10,239
Sure

1335
01:12:10,495 --> 01:12:11,263
Now his dad

1336
01:12:12,799 --> 01:12:14,079
Ethereal

1337
01:12:15,103 --> 01:12:17,151
And of course they all look like they're seven

1338
01:12:18,687 --> 01:12:20,991
18 years old that's just their that's just their genetic make

1339
01:12:22,783 --> 01:12:23,295
Elemental

1340
01:12:23,551 --> 01:12:25,343
Yeah like 17 year olds

1341
01:12:25,855 --> 01:12:27,135
Okay now one of them

1342
01:12:28,927 --> 01:12:30,975
One of them did Kill the other guy

1343
01:12:31,231 --> 01:12:32,511
But it was a Reptoid

1344
01:12:33,535 --> 01:12:35,839
Compromise

1345
01:12:36,095 --> 01:12:37,631
Okay

1346
01:12:37,887 --> 01:12:44,031
Alexander Jean

1347
01:12:44,287 --> 01:12:48,127
Save that

1348
01:12:48,895 --> 01:12:51,967
Maybe ten hours of my life that I can't get back

1349
01:12:52,223 --> 01:12:52,991
Listening to

1350
01:12:53,247 --> 01:12:54,015
Cassidy

1351
01:12:54,271 --> 01:12:58,111
Explain what happened to her when going to interview Mark Richardson prison

1352
01:12:58,367 --> 01:13:02,975
All of you the trouble of listening to all of it

1353
01:13:03,231 --> 01:13:05,023
I just playing the fun stuff

1354
01:13:05,279 --> 01:13:06,815
Cuz I'm busy

1355
01:13:07,071 --> 01:13:07,583
Terrible

1356
01:13:08,095 --> 01:13:08,607
So here

1357
01:13:08,863 --> 01:13:10,655

The videos Arthur

1359
01:13:12,191 --> 01:13:13,983
Seems to be the most

1360
01:13:14,239 --> 01:13:15,263
Who's the first one

1361
01:13:15,775 --> 01:13:16,799
First time she's ever met him there

1362
01:13:17,311 --> 01:13:23,199
A little bit of weed

1363
01:13:23,711 --> 01:13:24,991
Just juicy.

1364
01:13:26,015 --> 01:13:28,063
Introducing

1365
01:13:29,855 --> 01:13:31,391
Hi I'm Kerry Cassidy from

1367
01:13:34,975 --> 01:13:38,303
Program

1368
01:13:43,679 --> 01:13:49,567
Northern California and prison

1369
01:13:50,335 --> 01:13:52,383
Richard and ISTA

1370
01:13:55,199 --> 01:13:58,783
Appreciate

1371
01:14:00,319 --> 01:14:01,343
Worth it

1372
01:14:05,951 --> 01:14:10,815
Really a huge amount of information

1373
01:14:11,071 --> 01:14:12,351
He doesn't he's not animated

1374
01:14:13,887 --> 01:14:16,959
You are the most gullible person in the world

1375
01:14:20,031 --> 01:14:20,543
Mike Richards

1376
01:14:20,799 --> 01:14:21,567
An amazing man

1377
01:14:22,847 --> 01:14:23,871
He is amazing

1378
01:14:26,687 --> 01:14:27,967
There's there's

1379
01:14:29,503 --> 01:14:30,015
Yeah

1380
01:14:30,271 --> 01:14:33,599
You know what

1381
01:14:33,855 --> 01:14:34,367
Connotation

1382
01:14:34,623 --> 01:14:35,391
As opposed to

1383
01:14:35,647 --> 01:14:36,671
Just in a vacuum

1384
01:14:37,439 --> 01:14:37,951
The definition

1385
01:14:38,463 --> 01:14:40,511
Connect

1386
01:14:40,767 --> 01:14:43,071
To our normal Alex Jones episodes

1387
01:14:43,327 --> 01:14:46,655
Is where water

1388
01:14:47,167 --> 01:14:51,007
Well yeah if you ever saw Alex talk to Leanne McAdoo

1389
01:14:51,263 --> 01:14:52,031
Well yeah it's just

1390
01:14:52,287 --> 01:14:52,799
Carmen

1391
01:14:53,823 --> 01:14:54,335
Carmen

1392
01:14:54,591 --> 01:14:55,615
Really pertinent

1393
01:14:56,383 --> 01:14:59,199
Google Kerry Cassidy has dedicated her life to this s***

1394
01:14:59,455 --> 01:15:02,783
She thinks that Mark Richards is a real whistleblower

1395
01:15:03,551 --> 01:15:08,671
But he along with I can't remember the f****** dude name that we went over on the last one the super soldier guy

1396
01:15:10,975 --> 01:15:11,999
Sources of information

1397
01:15:13,535 --> 01:15:14,047
So

1398
01:15:14,815 --> 01:15:15,327
She's

1399
01:15:19,935 --> 01:15:21,983
I think so I think she gets

1400
01:15:22,239 --> 01:15:22,751
Donations

1401
01:15:23,007 --> 01:15:23,519
From people

1402
01:15:26,079 --> 01:15:28,895
If you look at her

1403
01:15:29,407 --> 01:15:30,431
Bella download

1404
01:15:31,711 --> 01:15:33,503
Don't look at me like that

1405
01:15:34,015 --> 01:15:34,783
Hey it's crazy

1406
01:15:35,039 --> 01:15:35,551
I mean

1407
01:15:36,575 --> 01:15:39,647
It's entertaining on someone

1408
01:15:39,903 --> 01:15:40,415
To the good stuff

1409
01:15:40,927 --> 01:15:42,207
Hours of boring

1410
01:15:47,327 --> 01:15:47,839
Thank you

1411
01:15:48,095 --> 01:15:48,863
You might be asked

1412
01:15:49,119 --> 01:15:49,631
Yourself

1413
01:15:49,887 --> 01:15:51,167
How did Mark get around in

1414
01:15:52,191 --> 01:15:53,471
Really good question

1415
01:16:03,967 --> 01:16:05,503
An artificially intelligent

1416
01:16:05,759 --> 01:16:08,063
Biologically intelligent

1417
01:16:12,159 --> 01:16:13,951
Spaceship called Minerva

1418
01:16:16,255 --> 01:16:17,535
The only person who could

1419
01:16:19,839 --> 01:16:20,863
She comes from

1420
01:16:22,655 --> 01:16:23,935
Solar system altogether

1421
01:16:25,215 --> 01:16:29,055
She considers herself to be a biological creation

1422
01:16:29,567 --> 01:16:31,103
Cute

1423
01:16:31,615 --> 01:16:34,943
I guess an instant she is

1424
01:16:36,991 --> 01:16:37,759
That's what I call her

1425
01:16:40,319 --> 01:16:44,927
Oscoda on that clip I don't have the audio interview

1426
01:16:45,183 --> 01:16:46,975
It's out of context

1427
01:16:47,487 --> 01:16:48,255
I played it back then

1428
01:16:48,767 --> 01:16:49,535
But

1429
01:16:50,047 --> 01:16:51,327
If she is ever met Minerva

1430
01:16:52,863 --> 01:16:55,167
And Joanne response

1431
01:16:55,423 --> 01:16:56,191
Break my heart

1432
01:16:56,447 --> 01:16:57,727
Because it's it's

1433
01:16:57,983 --> 01:17:01,823
Oh no I haven't but I'd love to meet the sweet thing

1434
01:17:02,079 --> 01:17:03,359
Of course and it's just

1435
01:17:03,615 --> 01:17:04,639
Toasted head

1436
01:17:04,895 --> 01:17:09,759
It's so sad she has an emotional bond with this imaginary artificial intelligence

1437
01:17:10,015 --> 01:17:13,599
Spaceship

1438
01:17:15,391 --> 01:17:17,695
And he's the only one who can play it

1439
01:17:18,463 --> 01:17:22,559
Update update on the fifth trip that she goes and visit Mark

1440
01:17:22,815 --> 01:17:25,887
It turns out they learned a couple of the people

1441
01:17:26,143 --> 01:17:29,471
How can I say she said he may be the only one if not

1442
01:17:29,727 --> 01:17:32,031
Point at the cat

1443
01:17:32,287 --> 01:17:36,639
Recording he was the only one

1444
01:17:36,895 --> 01:17:38,175
Have mastered Minerva

1445
01:17:39,199 --> 01:17:41,247
The artificial biological intelligence

1446
01:17:41,503 --> 01:17:42,271
In spaceship

1447
01:17:42,527 --> 01:17:45,599
Another solar system

1448
01:17:45,855 --> 01:17:51,999
It is a goddess of wisdom

1449
01:17:53,279 --> 01:17:53,791
And they don't know what

1450
01:17:56,095 --> 01:17:57,631
Vehicle

1451
01:17:57,887 --> 01:17:58,655
Mirror

1452
01:17:59,167 --> 01:18:00,191
Every

1453
01:18:00,959 --> 01:18:04,031
Racial vehicle

1454
01:18:04,287 --> 01:18:07,359
Minerva near every

1455
01:18:08,383 --> 01:18:08,895
Any

1456
01:18:09,407 --> 01:18:10,175
MI

1457
01:18:10,687 --> 01:18:15,295
Minerva is m stands for Minerva

1458
01:18:15,551 --> 01:18:16,063
Oh

1459
01:18:16,319 --> 01:18:16,831
Apartments

1460
01:18:17,087 --> 01:18:17,855
Be there you go

1461
01:18:18,111 --> 01:18:22,719
Okay of course mtn's for Minerva in the acronym spelling Minerva

1462
01:18:22,975 --> 01:18:24,255
This makes perfect sense

1463
01:18:24,511 --> 01:18:25,535
Mike Richards would back me

1464
01:18:26,303 --> 01:18:26,815
Vietnam

1465
01:18:27,071 --> 01:18:28,351
Definitely vehicle

1466
01:18:29,375 --> 01:18:30,399
All I know

1467
01:18:30,911 --> 01:18:31,935
What end

1468
01:18:32,191 --> 01:18:32,703
What goes after

1469
01:18:32,959 --> 01:18:33,471
Vehicle

1470
01:18:33,983 --> 01:18:34,495
In Akron

1471
01:18:37,311 --> 01:18:38,079
Got nothing

1472
01:18:44,735 --> 01:18:49,343
There is a really funny moment where someone asks what Minerva stands for in Joanne is like

1473
01:18:51,135 --> 01:18:51,647
Alaska

1474
01:18:55,487 --> 01:18:55,999
Sweetheart

1475
01:18:56,255 --> 01:18:57,279
Although

1476
01:18:57,535 --> 01:18:58,047
If she was

1477
01:18:58,303 --> 01:18:59,071
Really nice why is it

1478
01:19:01,375 --> 01:19:04,191
Because they had such a bond it's like a horse

1479
01:19:04,703 --> 01:19:05,215
I'm guessing

1480
01:19:05,471 --> 01:19:06,495
What's up

1481
01:19:06,751 --> 01:19:07,263
Some like

1482
01:19:07,519 --> 01:19:09,311
Literal Avatar

1483
01:19:09,567 --> 01:19:11,103
Your brain together with the

1484
01:19:11,359 --> 01:19:11,871
1004

1485
01:19:14,687 --> 01:19:17,503
Cool if we get into an issue

1486
01:19:18,015 --> 01:19:19,295
That's the next question I would

1487
01:19:19,551 --> 01:19:20,575
Jury is out

1488
01:19:20,831 --> 01:19:22,111
Don't know

1489
01:19:22,367 --> 01:19:24,415
This textbook gets into an issue I didn't know wasn't it

1490
01:19:25,951 --> 01:19:26,975
But it turns out it is

1491
01:19:27,231 --> 01:19:31,327
All right and it relates to our world more than we ever knew

1492
01:19:31,583 --> 01:19:32,095
This is it

1493
01:19:32,351 --> 01:19:32,863
Steph here

1494
01:19:33,119 --> 01:19:39,007
I also talked to him

1495
01:19:39,519 --> 01:19:42,335
Discovered there by the Marconi scientist and

1496
01:19:42,847 --> 01:19:47,455
There are at least 25

1497
01:19:48,479 --> 01:19:53,343
Number of LifeStream

1498
01:20:01,535 --> 01:20:05,375
And am I looking at

1499
01:20:05,887 --> 01:20:09,471
Artificially intelligent

1500
01:20:19,456 --> 01:20:24,064
Oil spills are actually artificially intelligent black

1501
01:20:27,904 --> 01:20:29,184
She did not say all

1502
01:20:30,464 --> 01:20:33,792
That one in particular

1503
01:20:34,048 --> 01:20:36,352
I mean you could really assume that anything

1504
01:20:36,608 --> 01:20:37,376
That looks black

1505
01:20:37,632 --> 01:20:38,656
And is good

1506
01:20:38,912 --> 01:20:39,936
They probably assume

1507
01:20:40,960 --> 01:20:41,472
Exact

1508
01:20:42,752 --> 01:20:43,776
Why do you think we get lunch

1509
01:20:45,312 --> 01:20:45,824
Totally

1510
01:20:46,080 --> 01:20:48,128
It's artificially intelligent

1511
01:20:48,384 --> 01:20:49,664
Yeah that's what it is

1512
01:20:49,920 --> 01:20:50,688
Good stuff

1513
01:20:50,944 --> 01:20:51,968
That's just good

1514
01:20:53,760 --> 01:20:54,272
X-Files

1515
01:20:54,528 --> 01:20:55,808
Yeah I think that's the Expo

1516
01:20:58,880 --> 01:21:01,696
But there was that alien guy there be black

1517
01:21:02,208 --> 01:21:02,976
Like

1518
01:21:03,232 --> 01:21:05,536
Liquid people I go into their eyes

1519
01:21:05,792 --> 01:21:06,816
This is

1520
01:21:08,352 --> 01:21:14,496
I mean you can also go with what the the symbiant from Spider-Man

1521
01:21:14,752 --> 01:21:18,080
There's all kinds of programming man

1522
01:21:18,336 --> 01:21:21,408
Siri

1523
01:21:21,664 --> 01:21:23,712
There's the well-known Grey Goose.

1524
01:21:24,992 --> 01:21:25,760
Which is

1525
01:21:27,040 --> 01:21:28,832
What happens if we develop artificial

1526
01:21:29,088 --> 01:21:29,856
Intelligent

1527
01:21:32,672 --> 01:21:33,696
Eventually they'll use every

1528
01:21:34,720 --> 01:21:35,232
Then we'll all just

1529
01:21:38,304 --> 01:21:39,584
That could be what they're afraid of

1530
01:21:40,096 --> 01:21:42,400
Who is like a like

1531
01:21:44,960 --> 01:21:49,824
We're going to need DJ Danger Mouse to get the black Goku and the white go together and make the Greg

1532
01:21:50,080 --> 01:21:50,592
This is how it

1533
01:21:51,872 --> 01:21:52,384
No

1534
01:21:52,896 --> 01:21:53,408
Not going to happen

1535
01:21:56,480 --> 01:21:58,528
More facts about

1536
01:21:58,784 --> 01:21:59,808
Raptors

1537
01:22:00,064 --> 01:22:03,904
Here comes more Raptor s*** this one is also about how they fun to move

1538
01:22:04,928 --> 01:22:09,536
Obviously movies TV

1539
01:22:10,048 --> 01:22:11,584
To this overall

1540
01:22:11,840 --> 01:22:13,632
Set of amnesia

1541
01:22:16,192 --> 01:22:16,704
Make sense

1542
01:22:24,384 --> 01:22:27,456
There's this latest dinosaur

1543
01:22:27,712 --> 01:22:28,224
Which is called

1544
01:22:30,528 --> 01:22:31,296
What's it called

1545
01:22:44,352 --> 01:22:46,656
Small dinosaurs

1546
01:22:49,984 --> 01:22:51,008
Dinosaurs

1547
01:22:51,264 --> 01:22:55,360
He said that are actually showing up

1548
01:22:55,616 --> 01:22:56,384
Participating

1549
01:22:57,920 --> 01:23:01,760
I thought they were going to

1550
01:23:05,344 --> 01:23:06,112
Mechanical

1551
01:23:11,232 --> 01:23:13,024
It's just something I like to do something

1552
01:23:13,536 --> 01:23:14,560
Consider

1553
01:23:14,816 --> 01:23:16,352
They do consider finding why wouldn't

1554
01:23:17,120 --> 01:23:20,704
I want to say that I saw one of these dinosaurs

1555
01:23:21,216 --> 01:23:23,008
Dog walking with the dinosaurs up close

1556
01:23:23,520 --> 01:23:24,800
But it looks real

1557
01:23:25,056 --> 01:23:26,080
When it's moving

1558
01:23:27,872 --> 01:23:28,384
Because

1559
01:23:28,640 --> 01:23:29,152
Their tube

1560
01:23:29,920 --> 01:23:30,432
They're like

1561
01:23:30,944 --> 01:23:31,456
They are

1562
01:23:31,712 --> 01:23:32,736
It's uncomfortable

1563
01:23:32,992 --> 01:23:34,528
Because it's something that looks like

1564
01:23:34,784 --> 01:23:38,112
Slumbering at you but if you look at it Motionless

1565
01:23:38,624 --> 01:23:39,392
It doesn't it looks like

1566
01:23:41,184 --> 01:23:41,952
It doesn't look like

1567
01:23:42,464 --> 01:23:45,024
If I saw a raptor alien next

1568
01:23:45,280 --> 01:23:45,792
1

1569
01:23:46,048 --> 01:23:47,584
Be very clear

1570
01:23:47,840 --> 01:23:48,864
No matter how

1571
01:23:49,120 --> 01:23:50,400
Still that Raptor could stand

1572
01:23:50,656 --> 01:23:51,936
It would be so f******

1573
01:23:52,192 --> 01:23:53,216
Can clear

1574
01:23:53,472 --> 01:23:53,984
Here's just a

1575
01:23:54,240 --> 01:23:56,288
This is used on set

1576
01:23:56,800 --> 01:23:58,080
Really easy question

1577
01:23:58,592 --> 01:23:59,872
Feathers

1578
01:24:00,640 --> 01:24:01,152
No

1579
01:24:01,408 --> 01:24:01,920
Well then

1580
01:24:02,432 --> 01:24:04,480
Not really

1581
01:24:04,992 --> 01:24:07,040
Not outside not out

1582
01:24:08,320 --> 01:24:11,648
What you need to know is there is

1583
01:24:14,976 --> 01:24:15,488
Alright

1584
01:24:16,256 --> 01:24:17,792
Because it another interview

1585
01:24:18,048 --> 01:24:19,840
Hey Carrie.

1586
01:24:20,608 --> 01:24:22,144
It might be a metaphor

1587
01:24:24,192 --> 01:24:27,264
But there is a there's another interview that you does with Mark

1588
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:28,032
Where he talks

1589
01:24:28,288 --> 01:24:29,312
About how

1590
01:24:30,592 --> 01:24:31,104
The bank

1591
01:24:31,872 --> 01:24:32,384
Get

1592
01:24:32,640 --> 01:24:33,920
Cons of raptor

1593
01:24:34,688 --> 01:24:35,200
Bigot

1594
01:24:35,456 --> 01:24:38,528
300 million answer

1595
01:24:39,040 --> 01:24:41,344
Is it

1596
01:24:41,856 --> 01:24:43,392
Why do people lie

1597
01:24:46,464 --> 01:24:49,536
This is one of the most poorly fat sky

1598
01:24:50,304 --> 01:24:51,072
Mark

1599
01:24:52,096 --> 01:24:53,888
He's in prison

1600
01:24:55,424 --> 01:24:56,448
I think that Mark

1601
01:24:56,704 --> 01:24:57,216
Has some issue

1602
01:24:58,240 --> 01:24:59,520
But they are

1603
01:24:59,776 --> 01:25:00,800
It isn't

1604
01:25:01,312 --> 01:25:05,664
Heavy as a lot of other things that we've discussed do you mean a shadowy group

1605
01:25:05,920 --> 01:25:08,736
Controller

1606
01:25:08,992 --> 01:25:15,136
Well I mean there are parallel aliens are funneling money

1607
01:25:15,392 --> 01:25:16,160
Money in the Bank

1608
01:25:16,672 --> 01:25:17,440
Controlling everything

1609
01:25:17,696 --> 01:25:18,720
Correspondence

1610
01:25:19,232 --> 01:25:23,072
Actually even a little bit more why it's a little troubling

1611
01:25:25,376 --> 01:25:26,400
Any of these trends

1612
01:25:28,192 --> 01:25:30,496
But be that as it may

1613
01:25:30,752 --> 01:25:33,312
More about these here Raptors

1614
01:25:33,824 --> 01:25:35,872
Fitbit clip is great

1615
01:25:36,896 --> 01:25:40,736
His role model and

1616
01:25:44,064 --> 01:25:47,648
Hamilton Air Force Base

1617
01:25:51,232 --> 01:25:52,768
Very impressed

1618
01:25:53,024 --> 01:25:54,048
What is Honorable

1619
01:25:56,352 --> 01:25:57,888
Military leader

1620
01:26:00,192 --> 01:26:03,264
He said the Raptors rent castles in the United

1621
01:26:12,992 --> 01:26:14,528
Pandora heavily-guarded

1622
01:26:20,160 --> 01:26:22,720
They may form a perimeter on the outside

1623
01:26:28,864 --> 01:26:29,888
Basically

1624
01:26:35,776 --> 01:26:38,336
He said that I don't like to

1625
01:26:39,360 --> 01:26:40,640
Serious

1626
01:26:40,896 --> 01:26:41,920
Is there aren't that many

1627
01:26:44,992 --> 01:26:47,296
National

1628
01:26:48,064 --> 01:26:49,600
Apparently not so much

1629
01:26:50,368 --> 01:26:52,160
He said the home

1630
01:26:52,416 --> 01:26:54,976
Where's Gary

1631
01:26:55,232 --> 01:26:57,792
65 million years ago

1632
01:27:05,472 --> 01:27:06,240
He said they didn't

1633
01:27:16,736 --> 01:27:18,528
Just recently

1634
01:27:21,344 --> 01:27:22,880
The physicist

1635
01:27:24,928 --> 01:27:25,952
What was his name

1636
01:27:28,768 --> 01:27:29,280
There it is

1637
01:27:30,560 --> 01:27:33,376
Just recently the physicist Stephen Hawking

1638
01:27:33,632 --> 01:27:36,960
S2000 believe in aliens

1639
01:27:37,472 --> 01:27:38,240
Center

1640
01:27:42,336 --> 01:27:43,104
Ring for

1641
01:27:43,616 --> 01:27:44,896
Sometime in other words

1642
01:27:45,152 --> 01:27:46,176
Possibly

1643
01:27:49,760 --> 01:27:51,808
Their Homeworld

1644
01:27:52,320 --> 01:27:54,112
Homeworld

1645
01:27:54,368 --> 01:27:58,208
The Draco constellation and it is now called

1646
01:28:02,048 --> 01:28:04,864
Turn on the news Rhapsody

1647
01:28:14,080 --> 01:28:15,360
What does must have saw that bit like

1648
01:28:18,432 --> 01:28:24,576
They we got hurt they got their Galactic map out they said Draco system like where else are we going to go

1649
01:28:24,832 --> 01:28:27,392
They're from the Drake

1650
01:28:29,440 --> 01:28:35,584
Okay so if I understand the timeline or not

1651
01:28:36,864 --> 01:28:37,632
This timeline correctly

1652
01:28:38,144 --> 01:28:38,912
Alright

1653
01:28:39,168 --> 01:28:40,960
65 million years ago

1654
01:28:41,216 --> 01:28:42,240
Chilling out on Earth

1655
01:28:44,288 --> 01:28:44,800
Victor

1656
01:28:45,312 --> 01:28:46,336
Spaceships

1657
01:28:47,360 --> 01:28:48,128
Catastrophe

1658
01:28:49,152 --> 01:28:51,200
Oh s*** look up there

1659
01:28:52,224 --> 01:28:53,760
Field technology

1660
01:28:54,016 --> 01:28:55,040
From another EX

1661
01:28:55,296 --> 01:28:56,320
Strattera

1662
01:28:58,624 --> 01:29:00,672
Only extraterrestrial race

1663
01:29:07,328 --> 01:29:09,632
Necessarily

1664
01:29:10,656 --> 01:29:11,424
But they get up

1665
01:29:11,680 --> 01:29:14,752
Get up planet and they're just tooling around

1666
01:29:15,008 --> 01:29:16,032
Having themselves a dick

1667
01:29:17,568 --> 01:29:19,104
Family get caught in the

1668
01:29:19,360 --> 01:29:20,128
Intergalactic

1669
01:29:20,384 --> 01:29:21,920
Ring right where they're stranded

1670
01:29:22,176 --> 01:29:26,016
Possibly even for thousands of years which brings into the question

1671
01:29:26,272 --> 01:29:26,784
Food

1672
01:29:30,112 --> 01:29:31,136
They each other's feathers

1673
01:29:41,376 --> 01:29:43,168
Establishes

1674
01:29:44,704 --> 01:29:50,848
The timeline only has a roughly a few thousand years accounted for as opposed to the 65

1675
01:30:00,064 --> 01:30:03,136
Just out of nostalgic

1676
01:30:03,392 --> 01:30:05,440
They like

1677
01:30:05,696 --> 01:30:06,464
Commerce

1678
01:30:06,720 --> 01:30:08,000
They like humans

1679
01:30:08,256 --> 01:30:11,840
Love movies

1680
01:30:12,608 --> 01:30:17,472
Go to your home it's like a fish swimming Upstream to

1681
01:30:17,728 --> 01:30:19,776
So there's that Elementary

1682
01:30:20,032 --> 01:30:21,568
And then the other one

1683
01:30:22,336 --> 01:30:22,848
There was a

1684
01:30:23,104 --> 01:30:23,872
Decent explanation

1685
01:30:28,224 --> 01:30:31,808
How the f*** is that come out of my mouth

1686
01:30:35,136 --> 01:30:36,928
Isn't that low enough for decent to me

1687
01:30:37,696 --> 01:30:40,000
There was something offered

1688
01:30:40,256 --> 01:30:42,304
As to why they came back here

1689
01:30:45,120 --> 01:30:47,424
Going to be till like 1 good

1690
01:30:50,240 --> 01:30:55,104
Raptors you guys didn't even know we could f****** the climate is temperate

1691
01:30:55,360 --> 01:30:56,896
And Mining is good

1692
01:30:57,152 --> 01:31:00,224
Cuz if you try and mine on an asteroid there's no gravity

1693
01:31:00,736 --> 01:31:04,576
Much easier to mine for stuff we get into that

1694
01:31:05,088 --> 01:31:08,416
The need for gold and s*** like that all over again

1695
01:31:08,928 --> 01:31:10,208
Like I love it when things go

1696
01:31:10,464 --> 01:31:11,488
It's so imaginative

1697
01:31:11,744 --> 01:31:13,024
And fun and then they bring it back

1698
01:31:13,280 --> 01:31:14,304
To something dumb that

1699
01:31:14,560 --> 01:31:17,120
That brings it all back into reality and then you have

1700
01:31:17,376 --> 01:31:18,656
Have to go like

1701
01:31:19,168 --> 01:31:21,984
Travel

1702
01:31:22,496 --> 01:31:24,800
Untold thousands of light-years

1703
01:31:25,056 --> 01:31:25,824
Forgot

1704
01:31:30,688 --> 01:31:32,480
Everyone knows

1705
01:31:32,736 --> 01:31:38,880
Is there was no gold on Dragon World they would have developed their own f****** economic system

1706
01:31:40,672 --> 01:31:45,536
Thing else they wouldn't still beat this randomly covering race memories of goal

1707
01:31:45,792 --> 01:31:48,352
Gold wasn't a financial thing back when Raptors

1708
01:31:51,168 --> 01:31:52,704
Right Fair

1709
01:31:53,728 --> 01:31:57,056
Well

1710
01:31:57,312 --> 01:31:57,824
Zacharias

1711
01:31:58,080 --> 01:32:00,384
Fiction book about it

1712
01:32:00,640 --> 01:32:01,152
The Anunnaki

1713
01:32:01,664 --> 01:32:04,736
Aliens and enlil

1714
01:32:06,528 --> 01:32:07,808
I came here to mine for

1715
01:32:08,064 --> 01:32:09,856
For gold was because the gold

1716
01:32:10,112 --> 01:32:13,184
Buy was needed to fix the atmosphere of their planet

1717
01:32:13,696 --> 01:32:19,328
Aerosolized

1718
01:32:19,584 --> 01:32:21,632
Was coming there was in there

1719
01:32:26,752 --> 01:32:32,896
Because they need to fix their planet

1720
01:32:33,152 --> 01:32:33,920
Where is the idea that they liked

1721
01:32:37,504 --> 01:32:40,832
They do like a carry and Joanne

1722
01:32:41,088 --> 01:32:42,368
Pictures of cool

1723
01:32:45,184 --> 01:32:45,696
But

1724
01:32:52,352 --> 01:32:52,864
Look

1725
01:32:53,376 --> 01:32:53,888
They're wrapped

1726
01:32:54,656 --> 01:32:55,168
Your people

1727
01:32:57,216 --> 01:32:57,984
I think you're cool

1728
01:32:58,496 --> 01:33:00,032
But you probably eat a chicken

1729
01:33:00,544 --> 01:33:04,384
I think Ella Raptor until the Raptors he's a super cool dude

1730
01:33:04,640 --> 01:33:05,664
But sometimes Raptors eat

1731
01:33:06,176 --> 01:33:06,944
What is the regular

1732
01:33:07,200 --> 01:33:10,528
Honestly we're all part of the food chain

1733
01:33:10,784 --> 01:33:12,832
I mean space-traveling Super Raptors

1734
01:33:14,368 --> 01:33:16,672
Emmett baby

1735
01:33:16,928 --> 01:33:18,976
Is an indication that I've done too much therapy in my life

1736
01:33:20,256 --> 01:33:22,304
Hear it being relayed from Mark

1737
01:33:23,072 --> 01:33:26,656
Frustrated

1738
01:33:27,168 --> 01:33:30,752
I'm hearing him trying to confess to murder

1739
01:33:33,312 --> 01:33:39,456
I hear hear it and it seems like I'm not a bad guy

1740
01:33:39,712 --> 01:33:42,016
Something happened and yes

1741
01:33:42,272 --> 01:33:42,784
There was a

1742
01:33:43,296 --> 01:33:45,088
And the kid part of it is probably projector

1743
01:33:48,672 --> 01:33:51,488
Some sort of like really weird

1744
01:33:52,000 --> 01:33:53,280
American Express

1745
01:33:53,536 --> 01:33:54,816
Through Raptors in

1746
01:33:55,328 --> 01:33:56,096
There their nature

1747
01:33:58,912 --> 01:34:00,448
Interesting thing if you have him right

1748
01:34:00,704 --> 01:34:02,496
An actual like sci-fi novel

1749
01:34:03,264 --> 01:34:07,872
Basically be the retelling of how he murdered

1750
01:34:08,128 --> 01:34:12,224
It would just be like if I did it

1751
01:34:13,760 --> 01:34:14,784
It Raptors

1752
01:34:15,296 --> 01:34:16,576
Here's how they would have killed

1753
01:34:16,832 --> 01:34:17,600
Nicole Brown

1754
01:34:18,624 --> 01:34:23,488
We're done with Rafters for the time being

1755
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:24,768
In this next clip

1756
01:34:25,024 --> 01:34:26,304
Good

1757
01:34:26,560 --> 01:34:29,120
I should tell you that this third interview was

1758
01:34:29,376 --> 01:34:29,888
Recorded

1759
01:34:30,400 --> 01:34:31,936
Elegant 2014

1760
01:34:33,216 --> 01:34:35,520
That was cuz you were you were talking about the

1761
01:34:35,776 --> 01:34:36,544
Traveling dinosaur

1762
01:34:38,592 --> 01:34:41,664
She's gone

1763
01:34:41,920 --> 01:34:42,944
Installment

1764
01:34:43,200 --> 01:34:43,712
Andover

1765
01:34:43,968 --> 01:34:45,248
Her travels to this prison

1766
01:34:45,760 --> 01:34:47,808
Because of

1767
01:34:48,064 --> 01:34:49,344
Hot-button issue that comes up

1768
01:34:49,856 --> 01:34:51,904
That was 14

1769
01:34:52,160 --> 01:34:53,440
Largely forgotten about

1770
01:34:53,952 --> 01:34:55,232
I think it's possible

1771
01:34:57,024 --> 01:35:00,864
That the Japanese royalty as well as

1772
01:35:01,120 --> 01:35:04,192
The royal

1773
01:35:04,448 --> 01:35:05,472
Related to bears

1774
01:35:08,288 --> 01:35:10,848
Now the Raptors

1775
01:35:11,104 --> 01:35:12,896
There is a serious

1776
01:35:15,712 --> 01:35:16,736
He believes

1777
01:35:19,808 --> 01:35:20,832
Large number of

1778
01:35:26,208 --> 01:35:26,720
Other

1779
01:35:33,632 --> 01:35:35,680
View

1780
01:35:42,336 --> 01:35:43,360
Very positive

1781
01:35:43,616 --> 01:35:44,896
Future if they don't

1782
01:35:47,968 --> 01:35:52,320
Do it this time their treaties they're honoring their treaties and they are basically

1783
01:35:55,136 --> 01:35:55,904
A couple important

1784
01:35:56,160 --> 01:35:57,696
When's the Raptors are pre-calc

1785
01:35:58,464 --> 01:36:00,768
Interesting that's a nice wrinkle today

1786
01:36:01,280 --> 01:36:04,864
And then also be if you didn't catch that but you saying

1787
01:36:05,376 --> 01:36:07,168
Is that Ebola is

1788
01:36:07,424 --> 01:36:07,936
Design

1789
01:36:08,192 --> 01:36:09,216
To take out reptile

1790
01:36:10,496 --> 01:36:13,824
So if you know of somebody who died from

1791
01:36:14,592 --> 01:36:15,616
You know now

1792
01:36:16,896 --> 01:36:17,920
They were actually Reptoid

1793
01:36:18,176 --> 01:36:18,944
Probably

1794
01:36:19,200 --> 01:36:19,968
2014

1795
01:36:20,224 --> 01:36:21,248
Crisis

1796
01:36:21,504 --> 01:36:22,528
Was largely in

1797
01:36:22,784 --> 01:36:23,296
West Africa

1798
01:36:30,208 --> 01:36:32,000
Yeah but the Blood

1799
01:36:32,512 --> 01:36:33,792
None of this makes sense

1800
01:36:34,560 --> 01:36:35,584
Gazebo

1801
01:36:35,840 --> 01:36:37,120
What is Jake

1802
01:36:37,376 --> 01:36:38,400
It is

1803
01:36:38,656 --> 01:36:41,728
Because you know why racist in a way that makes me go like

1804
01:36:42,240 --> 01:36:43,264
I can't quite pin down

1805
01:36:43,520 --> 01:36:44,032
This is

1806
01:36:44,288 --> 01:36:46,080
Really bad

1807
01:36:46,336 --> 01:36:47,360
Infield the races income

1808
01:36:47,872 --> 01:36:48,896
Cuz there's a binary

1809
01:36:51,456 --> 01:36:52,480
Raptors good

1810
01:36:54,784 --> 01:36:56,320
You look at it

1811
01:36:58,112 --> 01:36:59,648
Absolutely

1812
01:36:59,904 --> 01:37:02,464
Precognitive

1813
01:37:02,720 --> 01:37:04,256
Orange around the metro area

1814
01:37:04,512 --> 01:37:05,024
Court No Doubt

1815
01:37:06,560 --> 01:37:07,584
She grew up in SoCal base

1816
01:37:08,096 --> 01:37:08,608
Basically

1817
01:37:09,632 --> 01:37:10,144
Basic

1818
01:37:10,912 --> 01:37:13,984
This next clip we get into some more world history

1819
01:37:14,240 --> 01:37:16,800
Look through the prism of rapt

1820
01:37:17,312 --> 01:37:17,824
Raptors

1821
01:37:18,080 --> 01:37:21,408
Rapture

1822
01:37:22,944 --> 01:37:23,712
Reptoid

1823
01:37:25,760 --> 01:37:27,040
Those titties

1824
01:37:27,296 --> 01:37:28,832
Coyote information

1825
01:37:47,520 --> 01:37:48,288
And I would

1826
01:37:58,272 --> 01:38:02,368
Information he still has contacts in the military short

1827
01:38:04,416 --> 01:38:05,952
Contacts

1828
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:11,584
Back-channel information will come from what we know of as white hat

1829
01:38:13,376 --> 01:38:14,912
The US military is

1830
01:38:15,168 --> 01:38:16,960
What was carrier pigeon

1831
01:38:19,008 --> 01:38:19,520
Here we go

1832
01:38:19,776 --> 01:38:22,848
Like at least

1833
01:38:23,104 --> 01:38:23,616
A little bit

1834
01:38:24,128 --> 01:38:25,664
Oh yeah

1835
01:38:28,480 --> 01:38:30,784
The reptoids are in our government

1836
01:38:31,040 --> 01:38:33,600
Prison for all the time

1837
01:38:36,672 --> 01:38:40,256
Even in this weird fantasy world she has a more pessimistic

1838
01:38:41,536 --> 01:38:42,816
This f****** nice

1839
01:38:43,840 --> 01:38:49,728
Hero he doesn't even know that reptoids have infiltrated the highest

1840
01:38:49,984 --> 01:38:54,080
Only if you only don't men like him and the Dutchman

1841
01:38:57,152 --> 01:38:57,664
Like Mike

1842
01:38:57,920 --> 01:39:00,224
That's what he was doing

1843
01:39:01,504 --> 01:39:03,040
If you want to look at

1844
01:39:03,296 --> 01:39:04,832
Adjust through the prism of marks

1845
01:39:05,856 --> 01:39:07,392
America does not have reptoids

1846
01:39:08,160 --> 01:39:08,928
Japan.

1847
01:39:10,720 --> 01:39:11,488
West Africa

1848
01:39:12,256 --> 01:39:13,024
To the weird

1849
01:39:13,536 --> 01:39:14,048
It's very strange

1850
01:39:14,304 --> 01:39:14,816
Very weird

1851
01:39:15,072 --> 01:39:15,840
Global

1852
01:39:16,864 --> 01:39:17,632
I mean global

1853
01:39:17,888 --> 01:39:20,960
Don't really come up and Carries world

1854
01:39:21,472 --> 01:39:21,984
So

1855
01:39:22,240 --> 01:39:24,032
If we're going to put this if we're going to

1856
01:39:24,288 --> 01:39:24,800
Switch

1857
01:39:25,568 --> 01:39:26,848
Okay if we're just going to take

1858
01:39:27,360 --> 01:39:28,896
1 fantasy world and move it

1859
01:39:29,152 --> 01:39:30,944
Into our own fantasy world that we play in

1860
01:39:34,272 --> 01:39:36,064
SRP

1861
01:39:36,320 --> 01:39:36,832
Global

1862
01:39:37,088 --> 01:39:41,440
Toronto Raptors control

1863
01:39:41,696 --> 01:39:42,720
Hangman

1864
01:39:45,024 --> 01:39:45,536
Here's my feet

1865
01:39:46,304 --> 01:39:46,816
Alright

1866
01:39:47,072 --> 01:39:47,584
The Raptor

1867
01:39:48,096 --> 01:39:48,864
Are the global

1868
01:39:49,888 --> 01:39:51,168
Okay

1869
01:39:52,192 --> 01:39:53,728
In the same and look if Mark richer

1870
01:39:53,984 --> 01:39:55,008
Is friends with the Raptors

1871
01:39:58,336 --> 01:39:59,616
Is bad

1872
01:39:59,872 --> 01:40:05,248
Is an ant an everything he says they're doing

1873
01:40:05,504 --> 01:40:06,016
Is what

1874
01:40:06,272 --> 01:40:10,112
The boys are the good guy

1875
01:40:10,624 --> 01:40:12,928
Oh yeah this is what happened

1876
01:40:13,184 --> 01:40:13,952
Complete the left

1877
01:40:14,208 --> 01:40:15,744
With the Raptors

1878
01:40:18,048 --> 01:40:20,352
I'll tell you what I'm going to do

1879
01:40:20,608 --> 01:40:21,632
He's Lefty

1880
01:40:21,888 --> 01:40:25,472
Trendy raptors raptors

1881
01:40:28,800 --> 01:40:32,128
How come on Mike cernovich isn't a real name that's a rapper name

1882
01:40:32,384 --> 01:40:34,688
It's a Raptor Center Raptor exactly

1883
01:40:34,944 --> 01:40:41,088
I'm going to punt on the Raptor dichotomy

1884
01:40:42,368 --> 01:40:44,160
They seem pretty cool.

1885
01:40:44,416 --> 01:40:48,000
Gotcha we're going to get into a couple

1886
01:40:51,328 --> 01:40:53,888
F****** hilarious clips

1887
01:40:54,144 --> 01:40:54,656
Or like

1888
01:40:54,912 --> 01:40:55,936
I have to assume

1889
01:40:56,192 --> 01:40:56,960
They are marked

1890
01:40:57,216 --> 01:40:57,984
Testing the waters

1891
01:40:58,496 --> 01:41:04,384
Seeing what Carrie will believe I have to because these two are f****** weird

1892
01:41:04,896 --> 01:41:05,664
Must be having

1893
01:41:06,176 --> 01:41:06,688
The greatest

1894
01:41:06,944 --> 01:41:10,016
He's never had it easy

1895
01:41:10,272 --> 01:41:13,856
Board of prison

1896
01:41:16,928 --> 01:41:21,792
Get to say whatever you want and she has a platform of like millions of people watch

1897
01:41:22,048 --> 01:41:23,328
Beautiful

1898
01:41:27,168 --> 01:41:27,936
You just listen to this s***

1899
01:41:28,192 --> 01:41:32,800
Set a lot of reverse engineering Corporation

1900
01:41:36,384 --> 01:41:39,456
Possibly

1901
01:41:40,736 --> 01:41:41,760
Information

1902
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:54,048
Arresting and

1903
01:41:59,168 --> 01:42:00,448
TSA scanners

1904
01:42:00,704 --> 01:42:01,728
Instead there are

1905
01:42:01,984 --> 01:42:04,288
The dogs that are supposed to be smelling

1906
01:42:04,800 --> 01:42:06,080
Drugs are actually

1907
01:42:08,128 --> 01:42:10,176
Looking for 4 ET

1908
01:42:10,432 --> 01:42:10,944
They're not

1909
01:42:12,992 --> 01:42:14,272
A country

1910
01:42:18,624 --> 01:42:21,184
Scanners are actually used to determine

1911
01:42:23,232 --> 01:42:23,744
That's what it's about

1912
01:42:29,120 --> 01:42:30,656
12

1913
01:42:31,168 --> 01:42:33,472
You have to raise your hands over your head

1914
01:42:33,728 --> 01:42:34,240
Rapture

1915
01:42:34,496 --> 01:42:35,520
Can't do that

1916
01:42:35,776 --> 01:42:36,800
Unibrow

1917
01:42:46,272 --> 01:42:47,552
That's fair

1918
01:42:47,808 --> 01:42:50,112
You're going to give that one a pass

1919
01:42:50,368 --> 01:42:54,976
Here's this next week

1920
01:42:55,488 --> 01:42:59,584
A risk we have a risk of them replacing those in power

1921
01:43:03,168 --> 01:43:03,936
Chiefs

1922
01:43:04,192 --> 01:43:10,336
Check the biological material

1923
01:43:10,592 --> 01:43:11,360
Still Human

1924
01:43:11,616 --> 01:43:14,688
He said that there are also Android

1925
01:43:15,712 --> 01:43:18,272
Congress

1926
01:43:20,576 --> 01:43:21,856
I buy that immediately

1927
01:43:23,136 --> 01:43:23,648
Android

1928
01:43:27,744 --> 01:43:31,072
The Joint Chiefs of Staff weekly

1929
01:43:32,608 --> 01:43:33,120
Can't be at

1930
01:43:33,632 --> 01:43:39,776
Okay well Android

1931
01:43:46,688 --> 01:43:49,248
Army buried in there is developed Android

1932
01:43:56,928 --> 01:44:00,768
The next clip it gets a little peasant

1933
01:44:01,280 --> 01:44:02,560
Belittle

1934
01:44:03,072 --> 01:44:06,912
He said Israel is run by

1935
01:44:11,264 --> 01:44:12,288
Wish to

1936
01:44:19,200 --> 01:44:20,992
He didn't want to name the race that

1937
01:44:24,832 --> 01:44:27,392
It appears that the

1938
01:44:29,440 --> 01:44:30,720
Reminder

1939
01:44:31,744 --> 01:44:32,768
Indications are that

1940
01:44:33,024 --> 01:44:34,304
This is a fiction

1941
01:44:37,632 --> 01:44:39,424
In his book

1942
01:44:40,448 --> 01:44:43,008
Okay

1943
01:44:45,824 --> 01:44:46,592
Yeah

1944
01:44:47,104 --> 01:44:47,616
Sure

1945
01:44:47,872 --> 01:44:50,176
They came and created as a slave race in order to

1946
01:44:50,432 --> 01:44:50,944
Forget gold

1947
01:44:51,712 --> 01:44:56,320
That was a team for initials

1948
01:44:56,576 --> 01:44:59,392
And they run Israel

1949
01:44:59,648 --> 01:45:02,976
Marky Mark Wood names

1950
01:45:03,232 --> 01:45:05,024
Israel

1951
01:45:05,280 --> 01:45:11,424
Israel and the Vatican a run by competing alien groups that are trying to mix us up

1952
01:45:11,680 --> 01:45:12,448
Upping their skirmishes

1953
01:45:12,960 --> 01:45:13,984
That makes that is

1954
01:45:14,240 --> 01:45:14,752
F***** up

1955
01:45:15,520 --> 01:45:18,080
Just cuz you're adding alien doesn't mean like

1956
01:45:18,592 --> 01:45:20,640
All the conspiracy theorist

1957
01:45:20,896 --> 01:45:22,176
Pretty much point fingers at

1958
01:45:22,432 --> 01:45:23,712
The Jews

1959
01:45:25,504 --> 01:45:26,272
Massive groups

1960
01:45:26,528 --> 01:45:28,064
The conspiracy theorists go after

1961
01:45:28,320 --> 01:45:29,600
Any ideas

1962
01:45:30,880 --> 01:45:31,648
Look

1963
01:45:31,904 --> 01:45:33,184
Course you guys are right

1964
01:45:33,696 --> 01:45:34,208
Big picture

1965
01:45:36,256 --> 01:45:37,280
For the trees

1966
01:45:38,304 --> 01:45:41,888
Raptors

1967
01:45:42,144 --> 01:45:44,448
Extension he got y'all covered

1968
01:45:45,216 --> 01:45:45,984
So ridiculous

1969
01:45:46,496 --> 01:45:47,008
So ridiculous

1970
01:45:50,336 --> 01:45:50,848
She's

1971
01:45:51,104 --> 01:45:53,408
She's really just getting Mark into like weird

1972
01:45:54,176 --> 01:45:55,712
Political conversation

1973
01:45:57,504 --> 01:46:00,320
Imagine imagine you actually believe

1974
01:46:00,832 --> 01:46:01,344
In Raptors

1975
01:46:01,600 --> 01:46:02,112
Reptoid

1976
01:46:03,648 --> 01:46:04,672
The Anunnaki

1977
01:46:04,928 --> 01:46:06,464
This is hard to imagine

1978
01:46:10,048 --> 01:46:13,376
All of whom are competing to secretly control every

1979
01:46:15,424 --> 01:46:17,984
At all leaked it to other places

1980
01:46:18,496 --> 01:46:20,288
In order to discredit the other side now

1981
01:46:20,544 --> 01:46:21,824
These are very bad

1982
01:46:22,080 --> 01:46:22,848
They're bad

1983
01:46:24,128 --> 01:46:26,176
Okay much like Mark and murder

1984
01:46:30,528 --> 01:46:32,576
All of this is amazing all of this is true

1985
01:46:32,832 --> 01:46:33,856
Tell me more about space

1986
01:46:34,112 --> 01:46:34,624
Tell me about what

1987
01:46:34,880 --> 01:46:36,160
Tell me about all the steps

1988
01:46:36,672 --> 01:46:38,208
No I'm going to tell you about Ezra

1989
01:46:40,512 --> 01:46:46,656
Guiding the conversation clearly feel privileged

1990
01:46:46,912 --> 01:46:47,424
To be their talk

1991
01:46:51,776 --> 01:46:53,056
And you know what else you want to talk about

1992
01:46:53,568 --> 01:46:54,336
The Malaysian play

1993
01:46:57,408 --> 01:47:03,552
This interview took place in 2014

1994
01:47:03,808 --> 01:47:06,368
Tried to find out what Alex Jones said about the Malaysia

1995
01:47:06,624 --> 01:47:11,232
Complain not a great fit we couldn't really find him having too much of a theory on it

1996
01:47:11,744 --> 01:47:13,024
Mark f****** Richard

1997
01:47:13,280 --> 01:47:16,096
Knows exactly what happened and it's b*******

1998
01:47:16,352 --> 01:47:17,376
That the MS

1999
01:47:17,888 --> 01:47:21,216
The mainstream media

2000
01:47:21,472 --> 01:47:23,264
There

2001
01:47:23,776 --> 01:47:25,056
A report the truth

2002
01:47:25,312 --> 01:47:26,848
Here's the truth

2003
01:47:31,456 --> 01:47:32,224
And he said

2004
01:47:32,480 --> 01:47:34,528
Dimensional

2005
01:47:35,040 --> 01:47:36,832
Has four people on board

2006
01:47:39,392 --> 01:47:41,184
Was building a time-shifting

2007
01:47:41,440 --> 01:47:43,744
Machine that was too accurate

2008
01:47:44,256 --> 01:47:46,048
How to take a nap

2009
01:47:48,608 --> 01:47:52,704
Chinese

2010
01:47:52,960 --> 01:47:55,776
Alright

2011
01:47:56,032 --> 01:48:00,896
We're already on time shipping to

2012
01:48:01,152 --> 01:48:01,920
To technology

2013
01:48:06,528 --> 01:48:07,296
We have

2014
01:48:07,552 --> 01:48:08,832
Perfectly functional dimensional

2015
01:48:10,368 --> 01:48:13,184
But this time shift technology good

2016
01:48:14,976 --> 01:48:15,744
For humans to possess

2017
01:48:22,656 --> 01:48:23,424
I don't know

2018
01:48:25,216 --> 01:48:28,800
We can't let it go to the gym

2019
01:48:29,056 --> 01:48:32,384
But beyond that

2020
01:48:33,920 --> 01:48:35,200
Did this clip Goes On by

2021
01:48:35,456 --> 01:48:38,528
Much further where Carrie explains that this is where marked

2022
01:48:38,784 --> 01:48:39,552
Commercial

2023
01:48:39,808 --> 01:48:40,320
Because I could do

2024
01:48:40,576 --> 01:48:41,088
Just get timeshift

2025
01:48:44,672 --> 01:48:45,696
All the time

2026
01:48:46,976 --> 01:48:48,256
Apparently

2027
01:48:48,512 --> 01:48:49,536
I feel like

2028
01:48:49,792 --> 01:48:53,120
Every kind of big deal with the Malaysian plane disappeared

2029
01:48:53,376 --> 01:48:59,520
Everybody talked about it for a long time for a long time

2030
01:49:05,664 --> 01:49:07,968
Okay the man in Black was a Reptoid

2031
01:49:09,504 --> 01:49:11,808
I knew it

2032
01:49:12,576 --> 01:49:13,600
No that was a Jacob

2033
01:49:13,856 --> 01:49:15,904
Was a Raptor

2034
01:49:16,160 --> 01:49:17,696
Or no that's be the other way around

2035
01:49:18,208 --> 01:49:20,000
Unless you actually believe that the mess

2036
01:49:20,512 --> 01:49:21,280
The show was

2037
01:49:21,536 --> 01:49:23,328
Was the bad guy

2038
01:49:23,584 --> 01:49:26,400
Black was actually the 1,000

2039
01:49:26,912 --> 01:49:29,472
Jacob

2040
01:49:29,728 --> 01:49:32,800
He's lined up about the Raptors

2041
01:49:33,568 --> 01:49:35,872
Markhor

2042
01:49:38,688 --> 01:49:39,456
Whichever you feel like

2043
01:49:39,968 --> 01:49:40,736
Mark is one

2044
01:49:40,992 --> 01:49:42,784
Hundred percent lying about everything

2045
01:49:43,808 --> 01:49:44,832
So that means

2046
01:49:45,088 --> 01:49:46,112
Did the Raptors

2047
01:49:47,648 --> 01:49:49,696
No none of them exist

2048
01:49:51,744 --> 01:49:53,536
You're going to hurt marks

2049
01:49:53,792 --> 01:49:56,608
That's the part that I don't want

2050
01:49:57,888 --> 01:49:59,424
Brave

2051
01:49:59,680 --> 01:50:01,216
Is to internet

2052
01:50:01,472 --> 01:50:06,080
I just ragging on this sweet little woman

2053
01:50:07,872 --> 01:50:09,664
Murdering husband

2054
01:50:14,016 --> 01:50:14,528
I carry

2055
01:50:14,784 --> 01:50:16,320
Explain some of a question

2056
01:50:16,576 --> 01:50:17,344
Mark did not want

2057
01:50:18,368 --> 01:50:20,160
And it's not hey what about that murder

2058
01:50:21,184 --> 01:50:21,952
Which is what I thought

2059
01:50:22,208 --> 01:50:25,792
Rose going to be

2060
01:50:27,840 --> 01:50:28,352
Can of worms

2061
01:50:28,608 --> 01:50:29,632
Also

2062
01:50:30,144 --> 01:50:32,192
If he doesn't know something he doesn't seem

2063
01:50:32,704 --> 01:50:33,984
Shy about admitting that

2064
01:50:34,752 --> 01:50:38,592
In some cases he will say he will go research something and get back to

2065
01:50:41,664 --> 01:50:45,248
There was only one question answer

2066
01:50:45,760 --> 01:50:47,552
Particular question was

2067
01:50:50,624 --> 01:50:52,928
Set up a download in my state to be sure and ask

2068
01:50:53,952 --> 01:50:56,000
Whether or not he was currently going on missions

2069
01:50:56,512 --> 01:50:58,560
And the answer

2070
01:51:01,120 --> 01:51:02,144
Was not forthcoming

2071
01:51:02,656 --> 01:51:05,984
Almost every other question I asked him without fail

2072
01:51:08,544 --> 01:51:09,824
About whether another one

2073
01:51:10,080 --> 01:51:11,872
Give me a non-verbal and

2074
01:51:12,128 --> 01:51:13,152
Answering what you smile

2075
01:51:14,432 --> 01:51:19,040
And indicated that yes he is going on Mission

2076
01:51:19,552 --> 01:51:21,088
We did talk about time travel

2077
01:51:21,600 --> 01:51:23,648
Talked about using the Kaaba

2078
01:51:23,904 --> 01:51:25,440
Lightbody

2079
01:51:25,952 --> 01:51:26,976
Uso

2080
01:51:27,232 --> 01:51:28,256
He says human beings

2081
01:51:28,512 --> 01:51:29,536
Time travel

2082
01:51:30,304 --> 01:51:32,096
And she seems very familiar

2083
01:51:32,352 --> 01:51:32,864
Concept

2084
01:51:33,888 --> 01:51:34,912
So this is

2085
01:51:35,424 --> 01:51:37,728
It's something worth noting and obviously

2086
01:51:38,240 --> 01:51:39,520
If he's able to do this

2087
01:51:39,776 --> 01:51:40,288
This makes

2088
01:51:43,360 --> 01:51:44,128
Much more livable

2089
01:51:44,384 --> 01:51:46,944
If you can time travel and go out

2090
01:51:47,200 --> 01:51:48,480
No big deal

2091
01:51:48,736 --> 01:51:51,040
To do either of those things

2092
01:51:51,296 --> 01:51:52,832
Yeah but you work with dimension

2093
01:51:53,088 --> 01:51:54,112
Interdimensional

2094
01:51:54,368 --> 01:51:55,392
Sprite where do you meet them

2095
01:51:59,232 --> 01:51:59,744
Dementia

2096
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:00,512
Dementia

2097
01:52:02,816 --> 01:52:05,376
We've talked about magic

2098
01:52:05,632 --> 01:52:06,656
What you don't even need

2099
01:52:06,912 --> 01:52:07,680
To go out of

2100
01:52:07,936 --> 01:52:10,496
Well you need

2101
01:52:10,752 --> 01:52:12,544
Go see cuz the reptoids

2102
01:52:12,800 --> 01:52:14,080
To disappear the Malaysian plane

2103
01:52:14,592 --> 01:52:15,616
And he's not down with that

2104
01:52:16,128 --> 01:52:19,200
So they can probably the dimension shifting technology

2105
01:52:19,712 --> 01:52:22,528
So you wouldn't have access to that

2106
01:52:23,552 --> 01:52:25,600
And they don't like to go interdimensional

2107
01:52:31,488 --> 01:52:32,512
Out-of-body I am just

2108
01:52:32,768 --> 01:52:37,376
Sorcery

2109
01:52:37,632 --> 01:52:42,240
I imagine you can have an amazing Prison Break where a bunch of raptors show up in

2110
01:52:42,496 --> 01:52:48,128
Call the guard their sorcery make Cloud their minds

2111
01:52:51,200 --> 01:52:51,712
Cuz you're looking for

2112
01:52:54,016 --> 01:52:54,784
What the f***

2113
01:52:55,040 --> 01:52:56,576
Carrie I love you

2114
01:52:56,832 --> 01:52:58,880
Carrie

2115
01:52:59,392 --> 01:53:01,440
That brings us to the end of a Raptor investigation

2116
01:53:04,768 --> 01:53:06,560
Can we draw

2117
01:53:09,888 --> 01:53:11,424
Indicates to me that she

2118
01:53:11,680 --> 01:53:12,448
She knows

2119
01:53:12,960 --> 01:53:14,496
On some level whether it's

2120
01:53:14,752 --> 01:53:15,264
Yes or not

2121
01:53:15,520 --> 01:53:16,800
That Mark is a dude

2122
01:53:17,056 --> 01:53:17,568
You committed murder

2123
01:53:18,080 --> 01:53:19,104
Here here

2124
01:53:19,360 --> 01:53:19,872
Is this

2125
01:53:20,128 --> 01:53:24,480
Drop that he's also the kind of guy that you don't want to mess with

2126
01:53:27,808 --> 01:53:29,088
Listing in another cell

2127
01:53:29,600 --> 01:53:30,112
Yeah it is

2128
01:53:31,904 --> 01:53:36,256
True thing I think any of them

2129
01:53:37,024 --> 01:53:38,816
It's not the kind of guy you want to mess with

2130
01:53:39,072 --> 01:53:40,096
She could just mean that in that

2131
01:53:40,608 --> 01:53:41,632
Isn't any surgeon mansion

2132
01:53:42,144 --> 01:53:42,656
Space Warrior

2133
01:53:42,912 --> 01:53:44,704
Why would want to mess with

2134
01:53:44,960 --> 01:53:51,104
Where can I get a $5,000

2135
01:53:51,360 --> 01:53:52,384
He is somebody I don't want to mess with

2136
01:53:54,688 --> 01:53:58,272
I don't want to mess

2137
01:53:58,528 --> 01:53:59,040
I want not

2138
01:53:59,296 --> 01:54:00,576
Frankly I'm a little scared that we're talk

2139
01:54:01,344 --> 01:54:03,648
Quite frankly

2140
01:54:03,904 --> 01:54:04,416
Look

2141
01:54:05,696 --> 01:54:07,232
All all all I'm saying

2142
01:54:07,488 --> 01:54:08,768
Everybody listen to this

2143
01:54:09,792 --> 01:54:11,840
Make sure you stay out of Arm's Reach of a Raptor

2144
01:54:19,008 --> 01:54:19,520
Raptors

2145
01:54:19,776 --> 01:54:20,800
Apparently cool

2146
01:54:22,848 --> 01:54:24,896
No-fee ATM School

2147
01:54:26,944 --> 01:54:27,712
Mercenaries

2148
01:54:28,224 --> 01:54:32,576
Black gubat but also smart super intelligent

2149
01:54:33,856 --> 01:54:34,624
Minerva

2150
01:54:35,136 --> 01:54:35,904
Smart Plan

2151
01:54:36,416 --> 01:54:37,184
SoCal

2152
01:54:37,952 --> 01:54:39,744
Basically

2153
01:54:40,256 --> 01:54:41,280
NorCal

2154
01:54:42,816 --> 01:54:45,376
Little baby with a base play was

2155
01:54:45,632 --> 01:54:48,960
That's where they never even knew where she was

2156
01:54:49,472 --> 01:54:52,544
If I could leave everyone with one thing

2157
01:54:53,056 --> 01:54:53,568
To sum up

2158
01:54:53,824 --> 01:54:54,848
5e experience

2159
01:54:55,104 --> 01:54:56,128
And what we

2160
01:54:56,640 --> 01:54:57,152
It's

2161
01:54:57,408 --> 01:54:58,432
You watching

2162
01:54:58,688 --> 01:54:59,456
A TV show

2163
01:55:00,224 --> 01:55:01,248
Ask yourself

2164
01:55:02,016 --> 01:55:03,552
Did Raptors pay for this

2165
01:55:05,344 --> 01:55:07,392
And if they do

2166
01:55:08,672 --> 01:55:10,720
If you'll know check the credit

2167
01:55:11,488 --> 01:55:16,096
The why do you think they go by so fast now they used to have them you know on sitcoms

2168
01:55:19,168 --> 01:55:20,960
Yeah I'm right on the

2169
01:55:21,216 --> 01:55:24,544
Totally said it was a

2170
01:55:25,568 --> 01:55:26,336
Name a sitcom

2171
01:55:26,848 --> 01:55:27,360
Family Matter

2172
01:55:28,896 --> 01:55:33,760
You would have you would have the name with Reginald veljohnson

2173
01:55:37,856 --> 01:55:39,136
Did I do that

2174
01:55:42,208 --> 01:55:44,768
And if you see like a name that looks

2175
01:55:45,024 --> 01:55:46,048
Philly in the lake

2176
01:55:46,560 --> 01:55:47,328
For the Gasper

2177
01:55:47,584 --> 01:55:49,376
Catering or something like that

2178
01:55:49,632 --> 01:55:50,400
Some joke name

2179
01:55:50,656 --> 01:55:51,424
It's not a joke

2180
01:55:53,984 --> 01:55:56,032
It's not like some onset

2181
01:56:01,152 --> 01:56:03,456
Themselves

2182
01:56:03,712 --> 01:56:04,224
The Year Lisa

2183
01:56:04,736 --> 01:56:05,504
House of Horrors

2184
01:56:05,760 --> 01:56:06,272
Episodes

2185
01:56:06,528 --> 01:56:07,552
You think those are fake names

2186
01:56:08,064 --> 01:56:09,344
No those are actually they're wrapped

2187
01:56:10,112 --> 01:56:12,416
Every year

2188
01:56:14,976 --> 01:56:16,256
3

2189
01:56:16,512 --> 01:56:19,840
Because they like cartoons that they only want to make

2190
01:56:23,680 --> 01:56:24,448
No they don't understand

2191
01:56:43,904 --> 01:56:45,184
Doesn't seem human don't believe

2192
01:56:45,440 --> 01:56:46,208
They're trying

2193
01:56:46,464 --> 01:56:47,232
To get in your brain

2194
01:56:47,488 --> 01:56:48,512
And if it's Zionist

2195
01:56:49,280 --> 01:56:50,304
Probably the Anunnaki

2196
01:56:50,816 --> 01:56:51,328
Maybe

2197
01:56:51,840 --> 01:56:52,352
Who knows

2198
01:56:52,864 --> 01:56:53,376
Anyway

2199
01:56:56,704 --> 01:57:01,568
That somehow raises

2200
01:57:02,080 --> 01:57:03,104
Yep

2201
01:57:03,616 --> 01:57:05,920
How can you still be

2202
01:57:06,176 --> 01:57:08,224
Believe in Raptors and reptoids

2203
01:57:08,480 --> 01:57:08,992
And still be like

2204
01:57:09,248 --> 01:57:09,760
The Jews are hiding

2205
01:57:14,880 --> 01:57:16,160
You got a whole nother Step 2

2206
01:57:16,416 --> 01:57:18,208
Because Mark is this

2207
01:57:18,464 --> 01:57:19,744
Mark was nuts

2208
01:57:20,000 --> 01:57:20,768
Before he went to prison

2209
01:57:21,280 --> 01:57:22,304
Yes that's why

2210
01:57:23,072 --> 01:57:24,608
When you're in prison

2211
01:57:26,400 --> 01:57:29,472
Pretty easy for racism to get worse

2212
01:57:30,752 --> 01:57:31,264
I would

2213
01:57:31,776 --> 01:57:33,312
I'm not done any beds

2214
01:57:33,824 --> 01:57:34,336
The joint

2215
01:57:34,848 --> 01:57:37,664
Documentary I watched every

2216
01:57:37,920 --> 01:57:39,456
Raptor produced show about

2217
01:57:39,968 --> 01:57:40,480
Life in prison

2218
01:57:40,992 --> 01:57:42,016
It seems like

2219
01:57:42,272 --> 01:57:44,320
There are harsh racial division

2220
01:57:45,344 --> 01:57:46,624
So I imagine

2221
01:57:46,880 --> 01:57:47,904
Informing Samos

2222
01:57:50,976 --> 01:57:52,000
So anyway

2223
01:57:53,280 --> 01:57:53,792
Who's been fun Jordan

2224
01:57:54,048 --> 01:57:54,816
This is Ben

2225
01:58:00,704 --> 01:58:03,008
I just couldn't get out of my head this thought that

2226
01:58:05,056 --> 01:58:06,592
My girlfriend had where

2227
01:58:08,896 --> 01:58:11,456
What what I'm thinking now about how the world is ending

2228
01:58:11,968 --> 01:58:12,992
Is actually the most opt

2229
01:58:14,272 --> 01:58:16,320
Because it's the world doesn't end

2230
01:58:16,832 --> 01:58:18,112
It's going to be so much worse

2231
01:58:19,136 --> 01:58:19,904
Is it going to be

2232
01:58:20,416 --> 01:58:21,952
Keep going

2233
01:58:22,208 --> 01:58:24,000
Possible outcomes that we all just

2234
01:58:25,024 --> 01:58:25,536
Blippi

2235
01:58:25,792 --> 01:58:28,352
No I think actually the best possible that I don't want to get to

2236
01:58:29,120 --> 01:58:29,632
Cuz we're already

2237
01:58:30,912 --> 01:58:31,936
Write two hours or so

2238
01:58:32,448 --> 01:58:33,984
But like I think the best possible

2239
01:58:34,240 --> 01:58:36,032
Mario is

2240
01:58:36,800 --> 01:58:38,592
It's kind of a nut

2241
01:58:38,848 --> 01:58:39,360
Keep getting worse

2242
01:58:39,616 --> 01:58:40,896
But then

2243
01:58:41,152 --> 01:58:42,944
Spring blowback the other Direct

2244
01:58:43,712 --> 01:58:44,736
If some of these

2245
01:58:45,248 --> 01:58:48,064
Maybe more socialist type policies like

2246
01:58:48,320 --> 01:58:49,600
Healthcare for all

2247
01:58:52,160 --> 01:58:53,696
And we'll start to see

2248
01:58:53,952 --> 01:58:54,464
See the benefits

2249
01:58:55,232 --> 01:58:58,560
Kamala Harris just came out

2250
01:59:04,960 --> 01:59:05,728
Every politician

2251
01:59:05,984 --> 01:59:06,752
I'm going to have some problems

2252
01:59:07,776 --> 01:59:12,640
Yeah I think that what you'll see is a massive swing the other direction

2253
01:59:14,176 --> 01:59:15,200
Super liberal

2254
01:59:15,456 --> 01:59:16,224
It will rain

2255
01:59:16,736 --> 01:59:18,272
And I think that

2256
01:59:18,528 --> 01:59:19,552
The world

2257
01:59:20,064 --> 01:59:20,832
What's better way to going

2258
01:59:21,088 --> 01:59:24,672
Hopefully we'll stick with that but the reality is that we'll probably breathe

2259
01:59:33,120 --> 01:59:35,680
Massive Liquors know-it-all extreme

2260
01:59:35,936 --> 01:59:36,448
But

2261
01:59:36,704 --> 01:59:37,472
Did the Hulk

2262
01:59:37,984 --> 01:59:39,520
Is that the pendulum will swing

2263
01:59:39,776 --> 01:59:40,800
Really far to the right

2264
01:59:41,056 --> 01:59:41,824
And it'll get lodged in

2265
01:59:42,080 --> 01:59:43,616
In the wall or something like that

2266
01:59:43,872 --> 01:59:46,176
Metaphor doesn't really works

2267
01:59:46,432 --> 01:59:47,200
Not great but

2268
01:59:51,552 --> 01:59:53,088
That's the real that's the real issue

2269
01:59:54,112 --> 01:59:54,880
It always comes back

2270
01:59:55,136 --> 01:59:56,160
The system that enables

2271
02:00:03,840 --> 02:00:07,680
Amanda

2272
02:00:08,192 --> 02:00:11,520
