00:00:04,096 --> 00:00:10,240
Alexandra Thurston color

2
00:00:18,944 --> 00:00:20,480
Broken Social

3
00:00:29,952 --> 00:00:31,232
I don't know if I

4
00:00:31,488 --> 00:00:34,048
One of those groups that I'm sure I've heard

5
00:00:34,304 --> 00:00:35,584
You played a couple songs about Dino

6
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,376
But not off the top of my head

7
00:00:38,912 --> 00:00:41,472
I don't know maybe maybe

8
00:00:41,728 --> 00:00:46,080
Shut up we got a clip right there

9
00:00:46,336 --> 00:00:52,224
And I just had written off as like even when I was in college

10
00:00:56,576 --> 00:01:02,208
Iraq b*******

11
00:01:04,256 --> 00:01:09,632
I have no idea what that is

12
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:10,912
All Canadian

13
00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:17,056
Oh no it was essentially in the Same by all just garbage

14
00:01:17,312 --> 00:01:20,128
Any Canadian band with a rip-off of Rush

15
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:26,784
Every member of all of those bands has probably been in

16
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:27,808
Is that why they're called

17
00:01:32,416 --> 00:01:36,768
I recognized but I am

18
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:38,304
Very prejudiced

19
00:01:40,864 --> 00:01:41,888
Do you like people I

20
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:48,288
I think like them I never got into Nirvana because the cool

21
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:54,688
Kids at schools that didn't want to hang out with me all wore Nirvana shirt

22
00:01:54,944 --> 00:02:00,576
Not for me I'll go looking

23
00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:02,112
Pieces my brain

24
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:04,416
I've not been able to coach out of myself

25
00:02:04,928 --> 00:02:11,072
I famously discovered is a goatee

26
00:02:11,328 --> 00:02:16,192
Text my brother

27
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:18,496
Pretty cool

28
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:21,056
Major in college

29
00:02:24,384 --> 00:02:25,152
Thunder-like

30
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:27,968
There's a lot of good music I miss just because of that weird blind

31
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:33,344
Open

32
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,112
Talk to you later

33
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:35,904
Cold

34
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:37,184
What albums

35
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:42,048
What's the weather in Sicklerville

36
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:43,840
The way that I would judge

37
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:44,608
Describe broke

38
00:02:45,888 --> 00:02:46,912
Is baroque

39
00:02:47,168 --> 00:02:47,680
Post Rock

40
00:02:48,704 --> 00:02:54,336
Does that sound interesting to you

41
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:56,384
You love horses.

42
00:02:57,408 --> 00:03:01,248
You love her

43
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:07,136
Alright

44
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:13,536
Perfect

45
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:15,328
Thank you so much

46
00:03:24,288 --> 00:03:25,312
Next

47
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:27,104
Thank you so much

48
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:27,872
Ewok

49
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,760
The ex conspiracy theorist thank you so much

50
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:34,784
You are now policy

51
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:41,696
Eczema

52
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:47,072
If somebody donates on little bit of a

53
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:50,400
Elevated levels

54
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:52,704
Thank you so much you are now

55
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:59,872
Don't get mine until your brilliant someone someone sodomite sent me a bucket of

56
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:10,112
Request

57
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:11,392
Postcard

58
00:04:11,904 --> 00:04:13,696
I just got a postcard

59
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:19,583
I hope I'm not

60
00:04:23,423 --> 00:04:28,287
If this is the correct person to start coming soon

61
00:04:28,543 --> 00:04:29,055
24-0

62
00:04:31,615 --> 00:04:34,431
Have done you can do that

63
00:04:34,687 --> 00:04:35,199
Clicking the button

64
00:04:35,455 --> 00:04:36,735
Show we would appreciate

65
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:40,319
You have requested a button

66
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:45,439
But I have finally gotten up off my lazy

67
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:49,279
Well you should blame the shipping Department

68
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:53,631
But the different hi.

69
00:04:53,887 --> 00:04:54,399
You need to

70
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:57,215
You need a break at a shop

71
00:04:57,983 --> 00:05:01,823
Is that you

72
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:04,895
Oversight from management

73
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:15,391
But you recently just sent out all day literally

74
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:16,927
You have one button

75
00:05:17,439 --> 00:05:20,767
So I sent out all of our buttons

76
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:25,119
Hopefully you'll be coming soon if you are in England

77
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:31,775
International stamp

78
00:05:35,103 --> 00:05:40,735
Good on something here today that is

79
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:42,783
Euro time-travel suggestion

80
00:05:43,807 --> 00:05:49,951
Somebody's in that department that was made

81
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:59,679
Time travel episode

82
00:06:02,239 --> 00:06:03,007
And the

83
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:06,079
Now that I have reacted what his date was

84
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:07,103
Do you want me to do

85
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:08,127
I got everything

86
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:10,431
Looking backwards

87
00:06:10,687 --> 00:06:11,199
Wanted

88
00:06:11,455 --> 00:06:12,991
Episode

89
00:06:13,503 --> 00:06:15,807
Because

90
00:06:16,063 --> 00:06:17,599
The date that I was looking at

91
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:21,695
Benjamin Netanyahu

92
00:06:21,951 --> 00:06:22,719
Congress

93
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:24,767
Weird thoughts on it

94
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:28,095
I think we were in a position to know what was weird

95
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:28,863
And what was

96
00:06:29,119 --> 00:06:29,631
For Alex

97
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:34,495
Oh yeah I wanted to get to it down the road

98
00:06:35,007 --> 00:06:35,519
So

99
00:06:35,775 --> 00:06:36,287
I forgot

100
00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:45,759
Thought I felt but I would constantly be reminded whenever I would think about the time travel episode

101
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:49,855
Get to that one

102
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:51,135
I forgot

103
00:06:51,391 --> 00:06:52,159
What date

104
00:06:52,415 --> 00:06:52,927
Requested

105
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:54,463
So I sent him a message

106
00:06:54,719 --> 00:06:59,839
What date would you like

107
00:07:00,095 --> 00:07:02,655
F***

108
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:04,447
He said September 1st

109
00:07:04,703 --> 00:07:05,471
I'm not sure what you

110
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:08,799
So

111
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:14,431
Not doing that

112
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:15,199
Because we

113
00:07:23,135 --> 00:07:23,903
Whatever year

114
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:24,671
So

115
00:07:24,927 --> 00:07:25,695
I ran with that

116
00:07:25,951 --> 00:07:27,743
We got it we got to do what we can to make

117
00:07:27,999 --> 00:07:31,071
Things right so I chose September 1st 2011

118
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:32,863
Because I feel like that's the time

119
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:44,383
December 2012

120
00:07:44,895 --> 00:07:45,663
Things get real weird

121
00:07:46,175 --> 00:07:47,199
That's when

122
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:01,279
Year choice so I chose

123
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:02,303
2011

124
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:09,471
I miss this episodes weird man he's already claimed

125
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:14,847
Brought that up I want to address

126
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:16,127
The structure of the show

127
00:08:16,383 --> 00:08:16,895
Moving forward

128
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:19,711
I think I'm done with 2009

129
00:08:22,015 --> 00:08:23,551
Tax day

130
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:25,855
For today

131
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:27,647
But it's just nothing

132
00:08:27,903 --> 00:08:29,695
The show is really bad it's really boring

133
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:31,487
The only thing to take away from it would be

134
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:32,511
Eclipse

135
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:36,095
Basically expressing exactly what we've said about him

136
00:08:38,655 --> 00:08:41,727
He believes that Ron Paul in the 9/11 truth movement

137
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:43,007
Is responsible for the

138
00:08:43,263 --> 00:08:43,775
Tea Party

139
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:45,567
Hey Glenn Beck in Hillcrest

140
00:08:45,823 --> 00:08:49,151
So we've come to the conclusion that there's not really a whole lot left there

141
00:08:49,407 --> 00:08:51,455
I think we better use of our time

142
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:52,991
To jump to a new investor

143
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:57,087
Occupy Wall Street

144
00:08:57,599 --> 00:08:59,135
I think that Ebola timeline

145
00:08:59,903 --> 00:09:05,535
But the one that I want to be elbow timeline

146
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:09,119
Also the one I want most is

147
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:11,423
I want to start a hook

148
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:12,191
And see what Alex

149
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:15,775
Pitch that

150
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:17,311
I'm still with the audience pink

151
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:22,687
If you guys think that's a good idea let me know I would like that to be with our Monday episodes are moving

152
00:09:22,943 --> 00:09:24,735
Emotional

153
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:30,111
Ignore it

154
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:33,439
I don't know

155
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:40,351
Who knows what we might find.

156
00:09:40,863 --> 00:09:42,399
Where did I

157
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:45,983
Should we eat ice cream I don't know I think that might be the best

158
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:46,751
Use of our time

159
00:09:47,263 --> 00:09:50,847
We can find a more detailed version

160
00:09:51,615 --> 00:09:54,175
But I understand if a large portion of our

161
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:55,199
I think that would be

162
00:09:55,711 --> 00:09:56,991
Express

163
00:09:58,783 --> 00:09:59,551
And if so

164
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:01,343
Maybe the Occupy Wall Street

165
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:02,111
Who do the next one

166
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:05,183
Investigation

167
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:08,255
I'm a little bit Raw on 2009 at the Moana

168
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:09,535
I don't feel like

169
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:10,559
There's a lot of answers

170
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:12,607
Gotcha in April

171
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:15,679
I think later in 2090 probably

172
00:10:25,407 --> 00:10:26,943
2011

173
00:10:27,455 --> 00:10:28,223
September 1st

174
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:29,503
A novel context drop

175
00:10:40,255 --> 00:10:45,887
You don't have to take Lexie

176
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:47,935
Switch them around

177
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:52,031
Takes a lot of time without stalking

178
00:10:52,287 --> 00:10:52,799
About

179
00:10:53,055 --> 00:10:55,103
Whether or not it's appropriate

180
00:11:01,247 --> 00:11:03,039
Right

181
00:11:05,087 --> 00:11:06,367
It's weird and

182
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:10,463
Thank you thank Elan it would be what it is

183
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:13,535
It would be very different

184
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:20,959
Ops Pro hitting kit

185
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:25,823
Which the show

186
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:27,103
That I thought was

187
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:28,383
The definition

188
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:35,551
Welcome and thank you so much for joining us it is Thursday

189
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:40,415
The first day of September 2011

190
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:45,023
And we're going to be live here for the next 3 hours

191
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:49,375
Alex Shaffer at the bottom of the

192
00:11:49,887 --> 00:11:50,399
Hours

193
00:11:52,191 --> 00:11:55,007
California

194
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:58,591
Images of

195
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:01,407
Police were called

196
00:12:01,919 --> 00:12:04,223
By good see something say something citizen

197
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:07,039
I was dispatched Remy

198
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:12,671
So he Alex Shaffer on

199
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:16,511
Just to give you the details

200
00:12:16,767 --> 00:12:22,911
Set up and was outside

201
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:25,727
Chase Bank was also paying to get on fire

202
00:12:25,983 --> 00:12:30,079
Someone who walks by was like this is weird

203
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:33,407
They probably told police they took that guy

204
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:36,223
And they checked it just wrote

205
00:12:36,735 --> 00:12:37,503
Report about it

206
00:12:38,015 --> 00:12:38,527
It's not

207
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:41,087
I agree noticing it's weird

208
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:44,927
I disagree calling the cops

209
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:47,487
I would say that there's a fair conversation

210
00:12:47,743 --> 00:12:49,279
Should have minded their own business

211
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:52,351
But also if this guy wasn't

212
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:54,143
He probably would have gotten

213
00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:00,543
At this point in time it is almost

214
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:02,591
Negative moral choice to call the cops

215
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:07,455
Like it is almost it is almost an act of violence to call the cops

216
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:10,271
That's what I was talking about

217
00:13:10,783 --> 00:13:12,063
The first night that we were there

218
00:13:12,831 --> 00:13:13,599
Nextdoor there was like

219
00:13:13,855 --> 00:13:14,367
Huge

220
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:15,391
Adrian College party

221
00:13:15,903 --> 00:13:18,719
Until about 3 in the morning

222
00:13:18,975 --> 00:13:20,255
And one of the things I do

223
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:24,095
It's probably like

224
00:13:24,351 --> 00:13:25,375
It's probably awful

225
00:13:25,631 --> 00:13:26,655
The idea of calling app

226
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:28,447
Because like what

227
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:29,727
What you could accidentally

228
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:30,751
We bring it to somebody

229
00:13:31,007 --> 00:13:31,775
Life-like

230
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:34,591
Who knows maybe there's someone who's

231
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:38,687
The country right

232
00:13:40,223 --> 00:13:40,735
Consequences

233
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:44,319
Yeah it's it's weird to think about now

234
00:13:44,575 --> 00:13:48,159
That is almost attempted murder

235
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:49,951
Kind of really is

236
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:51,999
Attempt

237
00:13:52,767 --> 00:13:55,583
Attempted strong but yeah

238
00:13:57,887 --> 00:13:58,399
The point is

239
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:03,263
A building on fire

240
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:16,063
Put a regular regular pictures

241
00:14:16,319 --> 00:14:17,087
Daryl guy

242
00:14:17,343 --> 00:14:19,647
He was just like a jobber

243
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:21,183
Just going in there

244
00:14:21,439 --> 00:14:22,719
No no

245
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:28,607
Okay okay

246
00:14:28,863 --> 00:14:35,007
Imagining a regular old painter where the the white

247
00:14:35,263 --> 00:14:36,799
Overalls and the white hat

248
00:14:37,055 --> 00:14:41,663
Peter from the 1970s I don't know why that's the painter I'm not

249
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:49,855
And that is that Ron Paul agrees with him

250
00:14:57,535 --> 00:14:58,047
2012 election

251
00:14:58,303 --> 00:15:04,447
And remember Michele Bachmann

252
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:06,239
Mitt Romney said that he wasn't taking part in

253
00:15:06,495 --> 00:15:08,031
Atropos only caucus right

254
00:15:08,287 --> 00:15:11,871
Primaries I remember Michele Bachmann statement she put out after

255
00:15:12,127 --> 00:15:14,687
Does she want that primary or that

256
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:18,271
She was very thrilled very thrilled

257
00:15:18,783 --> 00:15:22,367
So

258
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:24,159
Disparaging

259
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:26,719
Michele Bachmann

260
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:28,767
Ron Paul

261
00:15:30,047 --> 00:15:33,119
Preparing for breakdown of Law and Order

262
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:38,495
I was able to confirm his views that he gave Robert the Iowa

263
00:15:38,751 --> 00:15:41,567
Was it difficult

264
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:46,687
Lochmandy bought 90%

265
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:51,551
Commissioners in perring

266
00:15:51,807 --> 00:15:53,855
I understand

267
00:15:57,439 --> 00:15:58,207
Right

268
00:15:58,463 --> 00:16:00,255
Particularly care about this

269
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:01,791
To be surprised by Ron

270
00:16:04,095 --> 00:16:05,631
Happening in 2011

271
00:16:06,143 --> 00:16:09,471
If you've already been like Ron Paul comes on your show all the time

272
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:12,543
You've been supporting him since

273
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:13,823
2008 election

274
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:18,431
You shouldn't be like it shouldn't be news that he agrees with you about FEMA camps

275
00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:25,087
Or something I don't really care about that

276
00:16:25,343 --> 00:16:31,487
Michele Bachmann

277
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:32,511
Inconvenience

278
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:35,583
Narrative of how things are going

279
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:39,167
Rock the vote

280
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:42,239
Oh that no matter what time of factors

281
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:43,007
F*** it

282
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:44,031
There's a conspiracy

283
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:45,567
Yeah that sounds good

284
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:50,431
What is good to use in campaign

285
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:54,271
Probably using those former governor of Minnesota money

286
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:56,575
Could be anything

287
00:16:57,343 --> 00:16:57,855
B Oliver

288
00:16:58,623 --> 00:17:02,719
Inconsequential because almost immediately

289
00:17:03,743 --> 00:17:06,047
Corporal punishment

290
00:17:06,303 --> 00:17:10,143
And when I started hearing him talk that I was going to

291
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:12,703
Do you goddamn

292
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:15,263
Better late never lay a hand on a kid

293
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:21,663
Really I thought for sure my mind never got fit never got there

294
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:23,455
My fault

295
00:17:23,711 --> 00:17:27,807
He would say why are there though those paddles with the holes in them anymore

296
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:34,207
Why are we using devices that were specifically invented to hurt children more

297
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:35,487
I thought

298
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:39,327
He would be so against the idea that there are public schools

299
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:40,351
And stuff like that

300
00:17:41,631 --> 00:17:43,167
By virtue of the fact

301
00:17:43,423 --> 00:17:46,239
That they're run by the globalist

302
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:59,295
Override whatever

303
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:01,343
I like the idea of violence

304
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:03,391
Stop with that but no

305
00:18:05,439 --> 00:18:06,975
Didn't blow my mind that's not fair

306
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:10,815
Took me aback for a second when he starts talking about the

307
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:15,167
And he seems to be really into the idea of teachers hitting kids

308
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:20,031
Well in this first clip you sort of expresses that it's better than them getting arrested

309
00:18:20,287 --> 00:18:20,799
But that is

310
00:18:21,055 --> 00:18:22,335
Reliant on a false dichotomy

311
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:27,967
Or the cops

312
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:29,759
Sure

313
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:31,551
That's a problem in Spanish

314
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:36,415
Caprice and then we

315
00:18:36,671 --> 00:18:37,183
We will

316
00:18:38,975 --> 00:18:41,535
Who want to destroy Law and Order

317
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:43,071
Yes

318
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:52,799
Restrict

319
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:03,039
And if you're going

320
00:19:04,831 --> 00:19:08,671
In a few areas in Illinois and New York where they do not

321
00:19:11,999 --> 00:19:12,767
As aggressive

322
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:19,679
That's where they have the shootings that's what the teachers are getting attacked that's where your kids are being

323
00:19:21,471 --> 00:19:23,519
That's weather

324
00:19:39,135 --> 00:19:42,975
Instead of

325
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:44,767
Dale cell

326
00:19:47,327 --> 00:19:50,911
A 17 year olds in the shower

327
00:19:57,311 --> 00:20:03,455
That's there with the school-to-prison pipeline

328
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:09,343
We should reform

329
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:21,375
No let the future get hurt you physically

330
00:20:30,335 --> 00:20:34,175
He's the problem of like Emma stolte at a Detention Facility

331
00:20:35,199 --> 00:20:35,967
Whatever

332
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:38,783
He sees that problem and it's solution is

333
00:20:39,295 --> 00:20:41,599
Looking for computers beat the rest

334
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:43,391
Which solution is

335
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:45,951
Systemic reform of

336
00:20:46,207 --> 00:20:51,583
Play previous all this archaic all day

337
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:53,375
You know to the vet

338
00:20:53,631 --> 00:20:54,143
8 respect

339
00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:58,239
Do teachers are you get get the hit

340
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:06,943
You if you remember Anna Green Gables she got hit all the time

341
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:08,735
That's what makes her case

342
00:21:11,295 --> 00:21:13,599
So he

343
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:16,928
Like

344
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:20,512
Just the idea of like a teacher giving a couple pops

345
00:21:21,024 --> 00:21:23,072
50 IDI

346
00:21:23,328 --> 00:21:23,840
Throw up

347
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:25,632
Is a emotional abuse

348
00:21:25,888 --> 00:21:27,680
Used to be

349
00:21:27,936 --> 00:21:28,448
V like

350
00:21:29,216 --> 00:21:29,728
If you don't

351
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,288
Complete the punishment

352
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:33,312
Uur

353
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:34,848
That level

354
00:21:35,104 --> 00:21:36,128
And then if you're doing that

355
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:37,152
Running into

356
00:21:37,408 --> 00:21:38,944
You can't run anymore something like that

357
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,736
It's also a public shaming

358
00:21:40,992 --> 00:21:45,088
Like everyone else is watching

359
00:21:45,344 --> 00:21:46,624
Layers upon layers

360
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:48,416
Abuse that Alex

361
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:49,696
Really into

362
00:21:50,464 --> 00:21:56,608
What is being directed towards children which is

363
00:21:56,864 --> 00:22:01,984
Run run until they throw up and that's because they stopped using the stock for public humiliation

364
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:05,824
You just put a big stock right back next to the basketball court

365
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:09,152
Right

366
00:22:09,408 --> 00:22:14,272
Everybody get to throw a few painful pop tomatoes

367
00:22:14,528 --> 00:22:16,064
So I kind of thought that that

368
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:16,832
Was going to be the

369
00:22:17,088 --> 00:22:18,880
Extent of it and being like this

370
00:22:19,136 --> 00:22:22,720
These child detention centers in Suffolk Juvenile Hall

371
00:22:22,976 --> 00:22:25,024
Is bat is a bad place

372
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:25,792
To go to

373
00:22:26,304 --> 00:22:30,144
Illusion the best reviews to get them

374
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,704
Kind of bad

375
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:33,728
Going to be it

376
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:35,520
But I would still an hour about

377
00:22:38,336 --> 00:22:40,128
He starts talking about the problem with liberals

378
00:22:40,896 --> 00:22:42,688
That's the problem

379
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:44,480
I need to get the kids more

380
00:22:44,992 --> 00:22:49,856
Your shoulder is not watched a liberal

381
00:22:59,584 --> 00:23:05,728
At least he's the Socialists were in front of me

382
00:23:07,008 --> 00:23:08,544
They were totally screwing up

383
00:23:15,456 --> 00:23:17,504
Disease are mentally ill people

384
00:23:20,064 --> 00:23:21,856
Totally wrecked

385
00:23:22,368 --> 00:23:28,512
Uranus is a socialist economic beliefs

386
00:23:28,768 --> 00:23:34,912
Enough to help Steve the means of production

387
00:23:35,168 --> 00:23:40,800
For the speaker

388
00:23:44,384 --> 00:23:45,664
Just talkin about

389
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:50,528
The baby was like

390
00:23:57,184 --> 00:24:02,816
Little baby

391
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:05,888
Images

392
00:24:06,144 --> 00:24:09,472
Got out and Alex had to leave the fever

393
00:24:09,984 --> 00:24:14,592
It all

394
00:24:14,848 --> 00:24:16,384
It's crazy

395
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:19,456
But it's also rely on this idea that liberals don't

396
00:24:19,968 --> 00:24:23,296
Their kids are not for their you stuff like that

397
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:26,368
Develops this

398
00:24:26,624 --> 00:24:27,904
A little bit more

399
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:31,232
It talks about how liberals

400
00:24:31,744 --> 00:24:32,256
Can't Raise a Man

401
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:41,984
Problem

402
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,776
As soon as you start getting autumn

403
00:24:48,384 --> 00:24:52,992
What is going to be absolutely miserable life

404
00:24:53,248 --> 00:24:54,528
Your training is going to be

405
00:24:58,112 --> 00:25:02,464
First of all

406
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:07,840
I don't know I don't know

407
00:25:10,656 --> 00:25:11,936
This should be in your custody

408
00:25:13,984 --> 00:25:18,336
This is an episode that should be played

409
00:25:18,592 --> 00:25:20,896
Having a dog

410
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:23,456
Damn liberals

411
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,248
My Challenger

412
00:25:26,272 --> 00:25:27,808
Dog parks

413
00:25:31,392 --> 00:25:34,720
Observing for a month when I come to the dog park

414
00:25:34,976 --> 00:25:37,280
Animals

415
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:48,800
Turn off my car

416
00:25:58,272 --> 00:26:01,344
So you can't if you're a liberal you can't really raised a dog cuz you allow it to

417
00:26:01,856 --> 00:26:03,136
Weird things out

418
00:26:03,392 --> 00:26:04,416
Groundhog Day

419
00:26:04,928 --> 00:26:05,952
Weird like wearing a

420
00:26:06,208 --> 00:26:12,352
Propeller beanie as weird for dog liberals do as Liberals are more likely to dress up there

421
00:26:12,608 --> 00:26:18,752
Weird Behavior

422
00:26:26,432 --> 00:26:32,576
Old ladies who think Barack Obama is the great Satan also probably put their dogs in tub

423
00:26:34,112 --> 00:26:37,440
Conclusion

424
00:26:37,952 --> 00:26:38,720
To beat your dog

425
00:26:39,488 --> 00:26:42,816
I mean I know that's not what he's saying

426
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:47,424
I'm using loose lips

427
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:50,496
Cuz he's not saying abusing that

428
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:01,760
So bad want to just be talking about is spanking in the home

429
00:27:02,016 --> 00:27:02,784
He's comparing it to

430
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:05,344
Corporal violence

431
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:06,112
Punishment

432
00:27:06,368 --> 00:27:07,392
In school

433
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:08,928
Being okay

434
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:11,232
It does

435
00:27:12,512 --> 00:27:13,024
A little bit

436
00:27:13,536 --> 00:27:15,328
Into things that are appropriate

437
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:19,936
Because he's not really cool

438
00:27:20,192 --> 00:27:22,240
Study after study

439
00:27:22,496 --> 00:27:23,776
Has proven that

440
00:27:24,032 --> 00:27:29,152
If you use violence against violent later on in life

441
00:27:29,408 --> 00:27:35,552
It is not they become cool it is that you're just breeding violence over and

442
00:27:35,808 --> 00:27:36,576
Over and over again

443
00:27:36,832 --> 00:27:38,112
Mild

444
00:27:38,368 --> 00:27:39,136
Is appropriate

445
00:27:39,392 --> 00:27:40,416
In certain setting

446
00:27:41,696 --> 00:27:42,208
The life-threatening

447
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:44,768
Running into traffic

448
00:27:48,608 --> 00:27:49,376
The literature on it

449
00:27:50,912 --> 00:27:53,216
Geologist psychologist degree

450
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:54,240
In those sorts events

451
00:27:55,008 --> 00:27:56,800
It's okay but once YouTube

452
00:27:57,312 --> 00:27:57,824
Punishment

453
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:58,848
Once you expand

454
00:28:00,896 --> 00:28:01,920
Is that associated with

455
00:28:02,176 --> 00:28:02,688
Behavior

456
00:28:02,944 --> 00:28:04,736
Yeah

457
00:28:04,992 --> 00:28:05,504
The trouble

458
00:28:07,296 --> 00:28:08,320
The Nuance of that

459
00:28:11,904 --> 00:28:12,416
The result of that

460
00:28:14,976 --> 00:28:16,512
Liberals don't do it enough

461
00:28:18,304 --> 00:28:18,816
The dogs

462
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:21,888
It's crazy because all of those guys

463
00:28:22,144 --> 00:28:23,424
Who are like

464
00:28:27,264 --> 00:28:29,056
Dude I got

465
00:28:29,312 --> 00:28:30,080
First off

466
00:28:30,336 --> 00:28:31,360
You didn't turn out fine

467
00:28:31,872 --> 00:28:33,408
And second neither did I

468
00:28:34,688 --> 00:28:38,272
Turn out fine excuses

469
00:28:38,784 --> 00:28:40,320
Sentimental

470
00:28:40,576 --> 00:28:41,088
Express

471
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:42,624
Was trying to justify this

472
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:43,392
Exact

473
00:28:43,648 --> 00:28:45,440
It's almost always like

474
00:28:45,696 --> 00:28:49,024
Kiddo

475
00:28:49,536 --> 00:28:50,816
Punitive

476
00:28:51,072 --> 00:28:55,424
But not realizing it what year

477
00:28:56,448 --> 00:28:56,960
Expressing

478
00:28:57,472 --> 00:28:57,984
How this

479
00:29:00,032 --> 00:29:06,176
Yeah

480
00:29:08,224 --> 00:29:12,832
Violet

481
00:29:13,856 --> 00:29:14,880
So we

482
00:29:15,136 --> 00:29:17,952
You know you talkin about how liberals can't raise dogs

483
00:29:18,976 --> 00:29:21,280
They're socialists in the movie theater needles are children

484
00:29:22,048 --> 00:29:22,816
Disciplining

485
00:29:23,072 --> 00:29:24,352
Or whatever

486
00:29:24,864 --> 00:29:25,888
Disappoint

487
00:29:26,144 --> 00:29:26,656
He's kind of

488
00:29:27,168 --> 00:29:29,728
Definition of liberal

489
00:29:29,984 --> 00:29:30,752
You talk about Democrat

490
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,056
No

491
00:29:33,824 --> 00:29:34,592
Midnight Club

492
00:29:34,848 --> 00:29:37,152
Define

493
00:29:37,664 --> 00:29:38,688
Is a disappointing definition

494
00:29:39,712 --> 00:29:44,320
Moron idiot

495
00:29:50,976 --> 00:29:53,280
Thomas Jefferson

496
00:29:59,424 --> 00:30:00,960
I'm talking about

497
00:30:01,728 --> 00:30:03,520
They're scared of snakes

498
00:30:13,248 --> 00:30:16,320
Do you know who is the most disappointing liberal of all

499
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:19,392
You're back

500
00:30:21,184 --> 00:30:21,952
Why do you start with me

501
00:30:22,464 --> 00:30:23,232
Gun

502
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:26,304
Political definition

503
00:30:26,816 --> 00:30:27,840
Countryside fight

504
00:30:28,096 --> 00:30:28,608
You don't wreck

505
00:30:28,864 --> 00:30:31,680
You don't like people who are ruled

506
00:30:31,936 --> 00:30:38,080
Well Rex was this Countryside and he was

507
00:30:38,336 --> 00:30:43,200
Alex was like well I guess I have a hickey without a liberal

508
00:30:43,456 --> 00:30:43,968
Fanatic

509
00:30:45,504 --> 00:30:46,528
Which is the same problem

510
00:30:46,784 --> 00:30:47,296
Snakes but

511
00:30:49,856 --> 00:30:51,392
Scared of

512
00:30:54,464 --> 00:30:55,744
Shouldn't

513
00:30:58,304 --> 00:30:59,072
ResCare.

514
00:31:05,472 --> 00:31:07,264
Instincts

515
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:09,312
Understand government

516
00:31:19,552 --> 00:31:22,880
And societies and societies

517
00:31:23,392 --> 00:31:29,536
Definition of liberal groups sounds like you did say that

518
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:34,656
It's so a liberal is one who is afraid of snakes but not of the government

519
00:31:34,912 --> 00:31:36,448
Good to know

520
00:31:41,312 --> 00:31:47,456
Not sure I agree with that definite I'm not a poli-sci major run

521
00:31:47,712 --> 00:31:50,784
Don't think

522
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:51,808
Accurately

523
00:31:52,064 --> 00:31:52,832
Depicts

524
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:55,392
Well I mean

525
00:31:55,904 --> 00:32:02,048
Is polarizing like we're more polarization than ever before

526
00:32:02,304 --> 00:32:06,400
88% of liberals disapprove of the job that Trump is doing

527
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:12,800
Was so many liberals aren't afraid of no

528
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:18,688
Sneaky Snake

529
00:32:20,224 --> 00:32:22,016
I don't know

530
00:32:22,528 --> 00:32:23,040
Like you should

531
00:32:23,296 --> 00:32:26,112
Please note please be like specific

532
00:32:26,368 --> 00:32:27,904
Cuz I'm not afraid of a garden snake

533
00:32:28,672 --> 00:32:29,184
Okay

534
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:30,976
What's 1 of metal

535
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:38,656
Got to give your card back Unfortunately they just kick me out

536
00:32:41,984 --> 00:32:44,800
I think it's rational to be scared of all snakes

537
00:32:45,312 --> 00:32:46,848
Even though some of them aren't dangerous

538
00:32:47,104 --> 00:32:49,152
Yeah I think it's still probably

539
00:32:49,664 --> 00:32:51,200
I think there's a instinctual like

540
00:32:51,712 --> 00:32:52,224
Human

541
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:58,624
Yeah Comfort with things that they crawl around on their belly and slither

542
00:33:00,416 --> 00:33:05,792
Welbeck that's like people

543
00:33:06,048 --> 00:33:07,328
Right

544
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:11,936
Most of us are Indiana Jones so in that we are afraid of

545
00:33:13,216 --> 00:33:16,800
Talking about how teachers

546
00:33:17,056 --> 00:33:18,080
Should be able to

547
00:33:18,336 --> 00:33:19,360
Just go ahead and

548
00:33:20,384 --> 00:33:21,664
Your kids if they want to

549
00:33:25,248 --> 00:33:26,784
The part that I find very

550
00:33:27,808 --> 00:33:28,320
He seems to be

551
00:33:28,576 --> 00:33:29,344
Pining for the

552
00:33:31,136 --> 00:33:32,672
When he is an adult

553
00:33:35,744 --> 00:33:36,768
And

554
00:33:37,024 --> 00:33:38,048
You would never allow his

555
00:33:39,072 --> 00:33:39,584
To be putting that

556
00:33:49,312 --> 00:33:50,848
Eyelash

557
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:55,456
The football coach

558
00:33:56,224 --> 00:33:57,760
Pops

559
00:33:58,272 --> 00:34:02,880
An NFL football coach

560
00:34:03,392 --> 00:34:03,904
What

561
00:34:08,768 --> 00:34:14,400
To disciplinary action

562
00:34:15,936 --> 00:34:20,544
Stories

563
00:34:22,592 --> 00:34:26,944
We've gone from a manhood Society

564
00:34:35,392 --> 00:34:36,160
Jellyfish

565
00:34:36,416 --> 00:34:42,560
Houston to Liberty re-up on option 2

566
00:34:48,192 --> 00:34:51,264
Beat up his football coach

567
00:35:00,224 --> 00:35:00,992
What's the movie theater story

568
00:35:02,528 --> 00:35:05,600
He's describing is a profoundly fuckedupshit

569
00:35:07,904 --> 00:35:09,184
Would punch a kid tent

570
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,464
First of all time

571
00:35:14,048 --> 00:35:15,072
Is Ja

572
00:35:15,328 --> 00:35:17,120
No one would bat an eyelash at that

573
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,680
Isaac even back then

574
00:35:23,264 --> 00:35:23,776
Beyond

575
00:35:24,032 --> 00:35:25,568
What is acceptable

576
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:26,848
In the time

577
00:35:27,872 --> 00:35:28,896
When corporal

578
00:35:29,152 --> 00:35:30,176
That was much more regular

579
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:32,992
Really interesting

580
00:35:33,504 --> 00:35:34,784
When you look at the map of states

581
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:37,600
It's still allow corporal punishment in schools

582
00:35:39,136 --> 00:35:45,280
Watch Justice League

583
00:35:45,536 --> 00:35:50,912
It's pretty much just the South with a little bit of the Midwest around Missouri and Kentucky

584
00:35:51,168 --> 00:35:56,288
Used in any public schools

585
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:59,360
So it's still legal

586
00:36:00,128 --> 00:36:06,272
This may be slightly dated info as

587
00:36:06,528 --> 00:36:10,880
I was working off from NPR

588
00:36:11,136 --> 00:36:13,440
It's legitimately

589
00:36:13,696 --> 00:36:14,976
Geographical split

590
00:36:15,232 --> 00:36:16,000
Clearly Define

591
00:36:16,512 --> 00:36:19,328
The more likely estate was to be a part of the Confederacy

592
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:22,400
The more likely it is that they still allow corporal

593
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:24,448
Those are things

594
00:36:24,704 --> 00:36:25,216
Contrack

595
00:36:25,984 --> 00:36:28,800
Will Smith

596
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:33,920
Is that whether it is that what they're the South will rise again and swelling

597
00:36:34,176 --> 00:36:35,712
In 1970s

598
00:36:35,968 --> 00:36:39,040
Supreme Court decided 52 for the corporal punishment

599
00:36:39,552 --> 00:36:40,832
You cruel and unusual punishment

600
00:36:41,088 --> 00:36:42,368
Nor did it tonight the student

601
00:36:42,624 --> 00:36:44,416
In question of due process

602
00:36:44,928 --> 00:36:46,976
In the case Ingram versus right

603
00:36:47,488 --> 00:36:50,048
That case involved a fourteen-year-old 8th grade

604
00:36:50,304 --> 00:36:53,120
Probably leaving Auditorium

605
00:36:53,888 --> 00:36:54,912
At that point

606
00:36:55,168 --> 00:36:56,448
Principal's office restraint

607
00:36:56,704 --> 00:36:57,984
It struck with a paddle at least

608
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:58,752
20 *

609
00:36:59,264 --> 00:37:01,312
The child suffered

610
00:37:01,568 --> 00:37:02,080
Hematoma

611
00:37:04,128 --> 00:37:05,152
Advised by doctors

612
00:37:05,408 --> 00:37:06,176
Arrest for 11

613
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:06,944
Some days

614
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:09,760
Another student at the school to receive the paddling the legend

615
00:37:10,016 --> 00:37:10,784
He was so severe

616
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,576
He was unable to use his arms

617
00:37:12,832 --> 00:37:13,600
For a brief.

618
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:14,368
Guitar

619
00:37:14,624 --> 00:37:17,696
Nothing

620
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:20,000
Free f***** up

621
00:37:20,512 --> 00:37:23,072
I mean I guess unusual

622
00:37:23,328 --> 00:37:25,632
Like if you have to use both of those words

623
00:37:25,888 --> 00:37:27,680
Like it is 100-percent cruel

624
00:37:28,192 --> 00:37:30,496
But it is not unusual for this

625
00:37:33,568 --> 00:37:36,384
Have laws prohibiting

626
00:37:40,736 --> 00:37:42,784
Iowa New Jersey

627
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:43,552
Hitting kids

628
00:37:43,808 --> 00:37:44,320
Privates

629
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:46,624
The only Tuesday

630
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:47,648
Out of the 50

631
00:37:47,904 --> 00:37:50,720
That have rules about what private schools

632
00:37:50,976 --> 00:37:57,120
Dude you don't want to regulate private Enterprise you don't want to keep corporations from dumping toxic

633
00:37:57,376 --> 00:37:59,424
Waste into our natural park

634
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:01,472
And you definitely don't want to eat

635
00:38:01,728 --> 00:38:02,240
Corporation

636
00:38:03,776 --> 00:38:09,920
Interesting Lee a 2016 study in the journal social policy information found by digging into

637
00:38:10,944 --> 00:38:12,736
School districts that allow corporal

638
00:38:13,504 --> 00:38:16,576
Imagine my surprise to read the black students are way more like

639
00:38:16,832 --> 00:38:17,856
Receive corporal

640
00:38:18,368 --> 00:38:21,696
More likely than

641
00:38:22,464 --> 00:38:24,256
Equally troubling their research revealed its 2

642
00:38:24,512 --> 00:38:26,304
With protective disability status

643
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:27,840
Which similarly more likely

644
00:38:28,352 --> 00:38:29,888
Recipients of corporal punishment in schools

645
00:38:32,192 --> 00:38:33,216
A possible explanation

646
00:38:33,472 --> 00:38:34,496
It didn't involve ViaSat

647
00:38:34,752 --> 00:38:37,568
Further examination

648
00:38:38,592 --> 00:38:40,896
Pure and simple black students male students

649
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:42,176
Students with disabilities

650
00:38:42,432 --> 00:38:45,504
We're consistently the target of disproportionate punishment

651
00:38:46,784 --> 00:38:47,552
Corporal

652
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:49,856
There's something is crystal clear

653
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:53,440
The date of May careers at

654
00:38:53,696 --> 00:38:54,208
Continuous

655
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:55,488
It is typically

656
00:38:55,744 --> 00:38:56,512
Disproportionate

657
00:38:56,768 --> 00:38:59,840
With some subgroups of children

658
00:39:00,096 --> 00:39:00,608
Understand others

659
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:02,144
They

660
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,192
Obviously

661
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:05,472
Like suspensions

662
00:39:05,728 --> 00:39:06,240
Expulsion

663
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:09,568
Well there's a very large

664
00:39:12,384 --> 00:39:12,896
Suspension

665
00:39:14,688 --> 00:39:15,712
Absolutely

666
00:39:15,968 --> 00:39:17,248
Controlling for other factors

667
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,552
What percentage of

668
00:39:21,856 --> 00:39:25,440
Disproportionately applied those punishment towards black students

669
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:28,000
Horse and a very similar trend is found

670
00:39:28,256 --> 00:39:29,024
When you look at corporate

671
00:39:29,792 --> 00:39:30,816
For similar in frack

672
00:39:32,864 --> 00:39:34,656
Irregardless of population

673
00:39:34,912 --> 00:39:35,424
Right

674
00:39:37,472 --> 00:39:40,288
Majority-black school majority-white school

675
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:41,312
It doesn't matter

676
00:39:41,568 --> 00:39:42,336
Across-the-board

677
00:39:42,592 --> 00:39:43,104
Blackstone

678
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:43,872
AR

679
00:39:44,384 --> 00:39:45,152
Far more likely

680
00:39:45,664 --> 00:39:47,200
In almost every locale

681
00:39:47,456 --> 00:39:49,248
That they studied to be

682
00:39:51,808 --> 00:39:54,880
Feel awful is that is you kind of expect

683
00:39:55,392 --> 00:39:59,232
Because of how bad we think humans are

684
00:39:59,744 --> 00:40:02,304
The revelation of looking at this was the disability

685
00:40:05,888 --> 00:40:08,704
Like that's really f***** up corporal punishment

686
00:40:09,472 --> 00:40:11,264
Consistently used at a higher level

687
00:40:12,544 --> 00:40:13,568
Who are disabled

688
00:40:14,848 --> 00:40:15,616
Really trouble

689
00:40:15,872 --> 00:40:16,896
NOAA

690
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:21,760
It makes sense to me mainly because I know how much abused

691
00:40:22,016 --> 00:40:22,528
Happens

692
00:40:23,552 --> 00:40:24,576
Old folks home

693
00:40:24,832 --> 00:40:28,416
I don't know why is there a nursing homes with no lights

694
00:40:28,672 --> 00:40:32,512
He says rather than clearly like

695
00:40:32,768 --> 00:40:36,352
I'm frustrated

696
00:40:37,888 --> 00:40:38,912
Who knows how much of

697
00:40:40,448 --> 00:40:43,520
Is based on zat

698
00:40:43,776 --> 00:40:44,544
Just making any kind of

699
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:55,552
Come up with a good reason other ideas Vine

700
00:40:55,808 --> 00:40:57,600
I don't know if that's the case but like

701
00:40:58,624 --> 00:40:59,136
Stocked up

702
00:40:59,648 --> 00:41:02,464
Just based on the fact there are these

703
00:41:02,976 --> 00:41:03,488
Physical anomaly

704
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,024
You fine in terms

705
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:06,816
Who is the recipient

706
00:41:07,072 --> 00:41:08,352
These corporal punishment

707
00:41:08,864 --> 00:41:11,168
That's enough that we shouldn't do it ever again

708
00:41:11,424 --> 00:41:13,216
It should be outlawed

709
00:41:13,472 --> 00:41:14,240
100

710
00:41:16,288 --> 00:41:16,800
It being

711
00:41:17,056 --> 00:41:20,128
Use as a systematic tool against

712
00:41:21,664 --> 00:41:23,968
Set

713
00:41:24,224 --> 00:41:28,832
Male students

714
00:41:33,952 --> 00:41:34,464
Like that

715
00:41:34,976 --> 00:41:35,488
Do that

716
00:41:35,744 --> 00:41:36,768
Unfortunately

717
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:38,048
That getting hit

718
00:41:38,304 --> 00:41:40,096
Imschools makes you better

719
00:41:40,352 --> 00:41:40,864
So

720
00:41:43,424 --> 00:41:45,216
Never ever fails

721
00:41:45,472 --> 00:41:46,240
Tubi

722
00:41:47,776 --> 00:41:49,568
No matter how many times you hear it but

723
00:41:49,824 --> 00:41:50,592
A black

724
00:41:50,848 --> 00:41:51,360
Child

725
00:41:51,872 --> 00:41:53,407
Seven-years-old

726
00:41:54,943 --> 00:41:55,711
Already

727
00:41:56,223 --> 00:41:56,735
That

728
00:41:57,247 --> 00:41:59,807
You're worse than other people and it's been hit

729
00:42:00,319 --> 00:42:01,343
And this continues

730
00:42:01,855 --> 00:42:02,879
For therein

731
00:42:03,135 --> 00:42:03,647
Tire life

732
00:42:04,159 --> 00:42:05,695
For their entire life in the United

733
00:42:06,463 --> 00:42:07,487
It is a constant

734
00:42:07,743 --> 00:42:09,279
Is it something that is

735
00:42:10,559 --> 00:42:13,887
Like

736
00:42:14,911 --> 00:42:18,495
Much

737
00:42:22,847 --> 00:42:25,407
I was looking at all the stuff I was trying to make sense

738
00:42:25,919 --> 00:42:26,431
Because

739
00:42:26,687 --> 00:42:28,735
I know that Alex hates violence

740
00:42:29,503 --> 00:42:30,783
About it all the time

741
00:42:31,039 --> 00:42:31,551
Like it's one of his

742
00:42:31,807 --> 00:42:32,319
Biggest

743
00:42:32,831 --> 00:42:33,599
Issues

744
00:42:40,255 --> 00:42:41,023
Trend would still be

745
00:42:41,279 --> 00:42:41,791
Detoured

746
00:42:44,863 --> 00:42:45,631
I understand

747
00:42:45,887 --> 00:42:48,447
You want to have a debate about in the home

748
00:42:49,215 --> 00:42:50,239
You know II

749
00:42:50,495 --> 00:42:51,775
I understand

750
00:42:53,311 --> 00:42:53,823
Get Matt

751
00:42:54,591 --> 00:42:55,103
You know

752
00:42:59,711 --> 00:43:01,247
Except severe Scituate

753
00:43:01,759 --> 00:43:02,783
That it may or may not be

754
00:43:03,551 --> 00:43:04,063
But

755
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:05,599
I do understand where the

756
00:43:05,855 --> 00:43:06,367
Debate

757
00:43:06,623 --> 00:43:07,135
A little bit

758
00:43:11,231 --> 00:43:11,743
Somewhat

759
00:43:13,791 --> 00:43:14,303
Maybe

760
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:16,351
I don't think there is much of it

761
00:43:16,607 --> 00:43:17,887
Debate about school

762
00:43:18,143 --> 00:43:19,423
Violence

763
00:43:19,935 --> 00:43:20,959
I don't think so

764
00:43:21,215 --> 00:43:21,727
A Alex

765
00:43:21,983 --> 00:43:24,287
Think that there is not only about it

766
00:43:24,543 --> 00:43:25,567
The other side is right

767
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:30,687
Eating kids at school is very weird to me

768
00:43:30,943 --> 00:43:31,455
Where the f***

769
00:43:32,991 --> 00:43:34,271
Because it has to come from somewhere

770
00:43:36,063 --> 00:43:36,831
Somewhere

771
00:43:37,087 --> 00:43:37,855
The power

772
00:43:38,367 --> 00:43:39,647
And he says this in the neck

773
00:43:39,903 --> 00:43:41,183
Text Cliff

774
00:43:41,695 --> 00:43:42,207
Express is where

775
00:43:42,463 --> 00:43:42,975
It's from

776
00:43:45,023 --> 00:43:46,559
And so under common law

777
00:43:55,519 --> 00:43:58,847
Anyone

778
00:43:59,615 --> 00:44:01,407
Force

779
00:44:04,735 --> 00:44:06,527
And to order that child

780
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:18,559
Now you can defend yourself

781
00:44:20,607 --> 00:44:21,119
You can't

782
00:44:21,375 --> 00:44:26,239
Defender

783
00:44:29,311 --> 00:44:32,383
You can't just go out and shoot somebody no matter how much you want to

784
00:44:32,895 --> 00:44:38,015
But if somebody breaks into your house you've always wanted to

785
00:44:38,271 --> 00:44:43,391
I mean talk about common-law and we know that that's where a lot of

786
00:44:43,647 --> 00:44:44,927
Is weird sovereign

787
00:44:45,951 --> 00:44:48,511
Yeah yeah

788
00:44:49,791 --> 00:44:50,815
Like off the bat

789
00:44:51,071 --> 00:44:55,423
I'm not sure that I know what he's talking about

790
00:44:56,191 --> 00:44:56,703
Legal guardian

791
00:44:56,959 --> 00:44:57,471
For the students

792
00:44:57,983 --> 00:44:59,263
And it somehow you give up your rights

793
00:45:01,055 --> 00:45:02,335
School that sort of thing

794
00:45:02,847 --> 00:45:03,615
That doesn't sound

795
00:45:03,871 --> 00:45:04,639
It's not

796
00:45:05,151 --> 00:45:06,687
But there is something

797
00:45:06,943 --> 00:45:07,711
Close to

798
00:45:08,479 --> 00:45:10,783
So if I had to guess I would say this is a reference

799
00:45:11,039 --> 00:45:12,063
In loco parentis

800
00:45:13,343 --> 00:45:14,111
But even this is super

801
00:45:15,135 --> 00:45:17,951
In loco parentis in place of parent

802
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:25,631
55

803
00:45:27,679 --> 00:45:28,191
Declared himself

804
00:45:28,447 --> 00:45:29,471
Parental over there

805
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:30,239
Since that way

806
00:45:30,495 --> 00:45:35,103
School for Orphans in Wards of the state

807
00:45:38,687 --> 00:45:43,039
From boarding school

808
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:47,135
Your brain doesn't have to stretch too far

809
00:45:47,391 --> 00:45:52,767
Fifties in Manchester either your parents or your kids

810
00:45:53,279 --> 00:45:55,327
In loco parentis

811
00:45:55,583 --> 00:45:57,375
Concept doesn't have much

812
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:01,471
Regularly eroded by

813
00:46:01,727 --> 00:46:02,239
Green Court decision

814
00:46:02,751 --> 00:46:06,079
West Virginia State Board of Education vs. Barnette 419

815
00:46:06,335 --> 00:46:07,359
43 rules

816
00:46:07,615 --> 00:46:09,151
Couldn't be forced to salute the flag

817
00:46:09,663 --> 00:46:10,687
Which means that the students have four

818
00:46:10,943 --> 00:46:11,455
First Amendment

819
00:46:11,711 --> 00:46:13,759
Open the school

820
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:15,551
So there's a difference

821
00:46:15,807 --> 00:46:16,319
A mezuzah

822
00:46:16,575 --> 00:46:18,111
Oh that's

823
00:46:19,135 --> 00:46:21,183
In cases like Tinker versus Des Moines independent

824
00:46:21,439 --> 00:46:23,231
Community School District in New Jersey versus

825
00:46:23,487 --> 00:46:24,255
PLO

826
00:46:24,511 --> 00:46:28,095
The court found that officials of the schools operate as representatives of the state

827
00:46:28,351 --> 00:46:29,375
And not purely in

828
00:46:29,631 --> 00:46:30,911
Some sort of Parental capacity

829
00:46:31,935 --> 00:46:32,703
So many other protect

830
00:46:34,751 --> 00:46:36,799
Citizens also apply to students

831
00:46:37,311 --> 00:46:39,103
The history of a lot of these.

832
00:46:39,615 --> 00:46:40,895
That's not nearly

833
00:46:43,199 --> 00:46:43,711
That

834
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:48,575
I misheard you and I heard

835
00:46:48,831 --> 00:46:49,855
Yellow

836
00:46:50,111 --> 00:46:56,255
Follow the electric they wanted to pick you up a little known fact

837
00:46:56,767 --> 00:46:59,583
Take the Long Way Home

838
00:47:03,167 --> 00:47:07,263
Important things to consider is that the roots of a lot of Education

839
00:47:07,519 --> 00:47:09,567
Particularly in this country

840
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:14,943
High School became more secular nature a lot of weird ideas about Authority changed a little bit

841
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:16,735
Reflect the changing priority

842
00:47:17,247 --> 00:47:18,271
I've been actual edges

843
00:47:19,295 --> 00:47:22,367
As opposed to school being place where you got moral instruction

844
00:47:23,135 --> 00:47:23,903
You'll notice

845
00:47:24,159 --> 00:47:25,439
Catholic and private school

846
00:47:25,695 --> 00:47:27,487
They still haven't changed that much

847
00:47:29,279 --> 00:47:30,047
Corporal punishment

848
00:47:30,303 --> 00:47:31,327
Is legally

849
00:47:31,583 --> 00:47:32,095
Protect

850
00:47:32,351 --> 00:47:33,375
Much more

851
00:47:34,655 --> 00:47:36,959
So these are the ideas of where the

852
00:47:37,215 --> 00:47:38,751
In loco parentis stuff

853
00:47:44,127 --> 00:47:44,639
The method exist

854
00:47:44,895 --> 00:47:45,663
Now has no business

855
00:47:46,943 --> 00:47:47,455
Is this sort of

856
00:47:47,711 --> 00:47:48,991
Absolutely

857
00:47:49,247 --> 00:47:50,015
Teachers art

858
00:47:51,551 --> 00:47:52,831
Inasmuch as

859
00:47:54,111 --> 00:47:54,879
Authority

860
00:47:56,927 --> 00:47:57,695
Descendants of like

861
00:47:58,207 --> 00:47:58,719
The Catholic

862
00:47:58,975 --> 00:48:03,583
Priest who's over the school spaceguard the virtue

863
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:04,351
Of all the stupid

864
00:48:06,143 --> 00:48:06,911
It's very different

865
00:48:11,775 --> 00:48:14,079
Babies up considerably in the past hundred years

866
00:48:14,591 --> 00:48:18,431
You still see some things like on a college campus will say it's a dry campus

867
00:48:18,687 --> 00:48:19,967
Where does a zero-tolerance policy

868
00:48:20,223 --> 00:48:22,783
Alcohol even though students their babies

869
00:48:23,039 --> 00:48:23,807
Legal drinking age

870
00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:27,647
These are remnants of this legal principle that was all just kind of decided

871
00:48:27,903 --> 00:48:29,439
To live with

872
00:48:29,951 --> 00:48:35,839
But here's the large anyway with daylight savings time but I guess we're just knocking

873
00:48:36,095 --> 00:48:37,375
Here Jordan is a larger issue

874
00:48:38,399 --> 00:48:43,519
Cannot be supportive of this sort of in loco parentis common-law bulshit

875
00:48:43,775 --> 00:48:45,055
In order to justify

876
00:48:45,567 --> 00:48:46,079
Sitting students

877
00:48:46,591 --> 00:48:49,407
And at the same time be supposed to school

878
00:48:49,663 --> 00:48:50,687
Restrictions on stew

879
00:48:50,943 --> 00:48:51,967
Bringing guns to college

880
00:48:52,223 --> 00:48:52,735
Which campuses

881
00:48:53,247 --> 00:48:54,015
The entire Prince

882
00:48:56,319 --> 00:48:59,391
I enjoy the same rights as they do in the outside world at school

883
00:48:59,647 --> 00:49:00,671
Is that needs to

884
00:49:00,927 --> 00:49:02,207
Extended Gun 2

885
00:49:02,463 --> 00:49:02,975
If he actually

886
00:49:04,767 --> 00:49:06,303
Of course he doesn't

887
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:08,095
Complete work to try and disrupt the effort

888
00:49:08,351 --> 00:49:09,119
What's the ban firearms

889
00:49:09,375 --> 00:49:10,911
On the UT Austin campus

890
00:49:11,167 --> 00:49:15,263
And he's now hired Kaitlin Bennett as a reporter who's really only famous for carrying

891
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:17,055
Gunn on the Kent State

892
00:49:21,151 --> 00:49:23,711
Parentis ideas only exist nowadays

893
00:49:24,735 --> 00:49:25,247
Restriction

894
00:49:25,759 --> 00:49:26,271
That exist

895
00:49:26,527 --> 00:49:27,039
Like

896
00:49:29,855 --> 00:49:31,647
Be kicked out of school if you want to

897
00:49:32,159 --> 00:49:33,439
You dated the wrong sort of person

898
00:49:33,695 --> 00:49:37,023
Or whatever

899
00:49:40,351 --> 00:49:42,143
There was a restaurant

900
00:49:42,399 --> 00:49:43,679
University

901
00:49:43,935 --> 00:49:45,727
Go to the restaurant

902
00:49:48,031 --> 00:49:49,567
And that was deemed okay

903
00:49:52,639 --> 00:49:54,175
These students are not allowed

904
00:49:54,431 --> 00:49:54,943
Go to the

905
00:49:55,199 --> 00:49:56,735
This restaurant

906
00:49:56,991 --> 00:49:57,503
No

907
00:50:00,575 --> 00:50:01,343
Private colleges

908
00:50:01,599 --> 00:50:05,951
Okay

909
00:50:06,207 --> 00:50:12,351
Is very weird Iowa New Jersey private colleges

910
00:50:12,607 --> 00:50:13,375
How out in front

911
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:16,447
Child freedom

912
00:50:16,703 --> 00:50:17,215
I don't know

913
00:50:17,471 --> 00:50:17,983
It's really weird

914
00:50:19,775 --> 00:50:21,823
Has about like you give over your Authority

915
00:50:22,335 --> 00:50:23,103
You give these kids

916
00:50:23,359 --> 00:50:24,127
To the school

917
00:50:25,407 --> 00:50:27,967
I don't know if you understand the ramifications

918
00:50:28,223 --> 00:50:28,735
Asian buffet

919
00:50:29,247 --> 00:50:31,039
But you really believe that then like

920
00:50:32,063 --> 00:50:33,599
Like what where does it end

921
00:50:33,855 --> 00:50:35,391
If they can physically assault the kids

922
00:50:35,647 --> 00:50:39,487
Assault them in other ways

923
00:50:39,743 --> 00:50:41,279
Like what do

924
00:50:42,303 --> 00:50:45,119
Fictional a parental Authority Zen

925
00:50:46,655 --> 00:50:48,703
It's just really weird

926
00:50:49,983 --> 00:50:50,495
Very

927
00:50:50,751 --> 00:50:51,263
Very well

928
00:50:52,031 --> 00:50:53,311
I don't understand where Alex

929
00:50:54,335 --> 00:50:57,663
Middle Ground

930
00:50:57,919 --> 00:50:59,967
I think he just wants kids getting hit

931
00:51:00,735 --> 00:51:01,247
High School

932
00:51:01,503 --> 00:51:05,087
Because I think he thinks it makes them better and tougher or something like that

933
00:51:05,855 --> 00:51:07,391
And I mean

934
00:51:07,647 --> 00:51:08,159
No

935
00:51:08,415 --> 00:51:08,927
Absolutely

936
00:51:09,183 --> 00:51:09,695
He's wrong

937
00:51:10,975 --> 00:51:11,999
But if it comes when I

938
00:51:13,279 --> 00:51:13,791
Is that is

939
00:51:18,399 --> 00:51:18,911
He has to be for

940
00:51:19,167 --> 00:51:20,447
Fishing

941
00:51:20,959 --> 00:51:22,751
Did he ostensibly isn't for

942
00:51:23,007 --> 00:51:25,311
Right so I just don't understand

943
00:51:27,103 --> 00:51:28,639
It's too late in this podcast

944
00:51:29,151 --> 00:51:30,175
Pictures of us doing it

945
00:51:30,943 --> 00:51:32,991
Years now for me to be surprised that there's something

946
00:51:33,247 --> 00:51:34,015
Is inconsistent

947
00:51:34,527 --> 00:51:39,903
Alex

948
00:51:40,159 --> 00:51:42,719
Really makes it seem like he wants

949
00:51:45,279 --> 00:51:45,791
Vacuum

950
00:51:46,303 --> 00:51:48,607
From parents

951
00:51:48,863 --> 00:51:49,631
Teachers

952
00:51:49,887 --> 00:51:50,911
Pastors

953
00:51:51,167 --> 00:51:53,727
Girl Scout leaders

954
00:51:56,543 --> 00:51:59,871
Respect you in any mammal Animal Kingdom

955
00:52:01,663 --> 00:52:07,807
This is already Ross

956
00:52:08,063 --> 00:52:09,855
Ice killer whale

957
00:52:31,871 --> 00:52:33,407
Kill

958
00:52:34,687 --> 00:52:36,991
Can you talk to your kids

959
00:52:37,759 --> 00:52:38,271
That's a good

960
00:52:39,551 --> 00:52:43,903
These seals have school where teachers hit kids

961
00:52:44,415 --> 00:52:50,559
Metaphor is falling apart already

962
00:52:51,071 --> 00:52:55,423
Centralized loco parentis rules for

963
00:52:55,679 --> 00:52:57,215
I mean it's crazy

964
00:53:01,311 --> 00:53:01,823
I don't

965
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:03,359
I don't know I didn't watch the same

966
00:53:03,615 --> 00:53:04,383
Nature special that he watched

967
00:53:04,639 --> 00:53:05,151
Or whatever

968
00:53:06,687 --> 00:53:07,711
The times when spanking

969
00:53:07,967 --> 00:53:08,479
Is

970
00:53:08,991 --> 00:53:11,551
Like the kid itself is what is life

971
00:53:14,879 --> 00:53:16,927
Sort of exception to that

972
00:53:17,183 --> 00:53:18,207
No spanking

973
00:53:18,463 --> 00:53:19,487
Principal

974
00:53:19,743 --> 00:53:21,535
What I understand

975
00:53:21,791 --> 00:53:24,351
Doesn't have kids

976
00:53:24,863 --> 00:53:25,631
Hi-5

977
00:53:28,191 --> 00:53:29,983
He's describing an animal kingdom

978
00:53:30,239 --> 00:53:34,079
Is the analog to be possibly okay version of spanking a child

979
00:53:34,335 --> 00:53:35,359
But he's trying to

980
00:53:35,615 --> 00:53:36,639
To make that

981
00:53:38,943 --> 00:53:40,223
And people in the schools haitink

982
00:53:40,479 --> 00:53:41,503
Right

983
00:53:42,527 --> 00:53:44,063
For one reason again like I said

984
00:53:44,575 --> 00:53:45,599
Seals don't have an

985
00:53:46,623 --> 00:53:47,391
It's second

986
00:53:48,671 --> 00:53:49,439
The Ava School

987
00:53:49,695 --> 00:53:51,487
It's not a life-threatening situation

988
00:53:51,999 --> 00:53:53,023
It's always

989
00:53:54,047 --> 00:53:55,583
It's always a physical

990
00:53:56,095 --> 00:53:57,119
That you're doing to a

991
00:53:57,631 --> 00:53:58,655
Yeah it's not

992
00:53:58,911 --> 00:54:00,447
Appropriate it's not productive

993
00:54:01,215 --> 00:54:03,007
Nothing along those lines is okay

994
00:54:03,263 --> 00:54:04,031
He's trying to

995
00:54:04,287 --> 00:54:06,591
Muddy The Waters by using an animal

996
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:12,223
Does it ever cross any of these people's minds

997
00:54:12,479 --> 00:54:13,759
Who are making me to argue

998
00:54:14,271 --> 00:54:15,551
It's about the animal kingdom

999
00:54:16,063 --> 00:54:16,575
It's fine

1000
00:54:16,831 --> 00:54:19,391
I bet we're trying to

1001
00:54:19,647 --> 00:54:20,159
Like

1002
00:54:22,463 --> 00:54:23,999
Like today ever get this like

1003
00:54:24,255 --> 00:54:28,095
Well if seals

1004
00:54:28,351 --> 00:54:29,375
Steele's don't

1005
00:54:29,887 --> 00:54:30,399
Bill

1006
00:54:30,655 --> 00:54:31,167
Stop

1007
00:54:31,423 --> 00:54:33,983
Like maybe we're trying to

1008
00:54:36,543 --> 00:54:39,615
Fuel evolution

1009
00:54:39,871 --> 00:54:41,151
Create a better Society

1010
00:54:41,663 --> 00:54:43,455
If we weren't exactly like

1011
00:54:43,711 --> 00:54:47,295
Steel and Justice something is a natural response

1012
00:54:47,551 --> 00:54:48,319
2 something doesn't

1013
00:54:48,831 --> 00:54:50,623
A good response

1014
00:54:50,879 --> 00:54:53,951
Is a productive response maybe the field

1015
00:54:54,207 --> 00:54:59,839
The kid. Making

1016
00:55:00,095 --> 00:55:00,607
You know

1017
00:55:02,911 --> 00:55:04,447
Totally naturalism

1018
00:55:04,959 --> 00:55:08,543
The best thing it could do right because we have higher cognitive function

1019
00:55:08,799 --> 00:55:10,335
We could observe that behavior

1020
00:55:10,591 --> 00:55:11,871
And then be like

1021
00:55:12,895 --> 00:55:14,687
F***** up those animals

1022
00:55:14,943 --> 00:55:16,991
Oh yeah

1023
00:55:18,015 --> 00:55:19,295
I'm not a Crocodile Dundee

1024
00:55:20,831 --> 00:55:22,623
Praying mantis

1025
00:55:25,439 --> 00:55:26,207
There you go

1026
00:55:28,255 --> 00:55:29,791
Alright

1027
00:55:31,327 --> 00:55:32,351
We talked a little bit about

1028
00:55:37,215 --> 00:55:39,775
Blind

1029
00:55:45,151 --> 00:55:50,271
Baby deer that are almost grown up almost leaving her mother run out but she smell something

1030
00:55:51,039 --> 00:55:53,599
She comes out gets in front of a truck

1031
00:55:55,391 --> 00:55:56,671
What should I kill the both

1032
00:56:03,583 --> 00:56:06,143
Turn around and chicom

1033
00:56:15,103 --> 00:56:16,383
That really doesn't sound right

1034
00:56:16,639 --> 00:56:17,407
To shoot

1035
00:56:19,199 --> 00:56:23,295
We're too busy being afraid of snakes

1036
00:56:24,319 --> 00:56:25,599
But she smells

1037
00:56:25,855 --> 00:56:26,879
Smell

1038
00:56:27,135 --> 00:56:29,439
Of the creature that she knows kills deer

1039
00:56:30,975 --> 00:56:31,487
Alex

1040
00:56:35,327 --> 00:56:36,351
She smells

1041
00:56:36,607 --> 00:56:37,375
Murderer

1042
00:56:37,631 --> 00:56:40,959
Murder on a regular basis

1043
00:56:41,215 --> 00:56:47,103
To her family

1044
00:56:47,359 --> 00:56:51,199
Metaphor

1045
00:56:51,455 --> 00:56:56,575
Muddying the Waters of what

1046
00:56:58,367 --> 00:56:58,879
Is

1047
00:57:02,207 --> 00:57:04,767
For that van because Alex is coming

1048
00:57:05,023 --> 00:57:09,887
If your if even if your kid walks out of the traffic

1049
00:57:10,143 --> 00:57:16,287
And there's a car coming and you're like I know what to do but I got to get this out of the way if you jumped

1050
00:57:19,615 --> 00:57:20,895
But you did save his life

1051
00:57:21,663 --> 00:57:22,175
Sure

1052
00:57:22,431 --> 00:57:23,199
I hope he lives

1053
00:57:25,759 --> 00:57:27,807
You were a deer that might be

1054
00:57:29,343 --> 00:57:30,623
But you know what you could do

1055
00:57:30,879 --> 00:57:31,647
Just be like hey come back

1056
00:57:33,439 --> 00:57:34,975
Certifikid understand

1057
00:57:36,511 --> 00:57:37,023
But

1058
00:57:38,559 --> 00:57:39,327
It's a mess it's a

1059
00:57:39,583 --> 00:57:41,887
Metaphors don't work

1060
00:57:42,143 --> 00:57:42,655
Tired

1061
00:57:42,911 --> 00:57:44,191
To animal behavior

1062
00:57:44,703 --> 00:57:45,471
I got to stress

1063
00:57:45,727 --> 00:57:46,751
Details an hour

1064
00:57:47,263 --> 00:57:53,407
I can't believe he doesn't our choose different animals to compare

1065
00:57:56,223 --> 00:57:57,759
All I can really describe

1066
00:57:58,271 --> 00:57:58,783
You want

1067
00:58:00,831 --> 00:58:03,647
Because it's

1068
00:58:05,695 --> 00:58:06,719
This country

1069
00:58:10,047 --> 00:58:10,815
Tutu School

1070
00:58:11,583 --> 00:58:13,887
ER now

1071
00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:25,151
Castle Law

1072
00:58:34,623 --> 00:58:36,415
Idiots

1073
00:58:45,631 --> 00:58:47,935
When you put them in that school

1074
00:58:48,447 --> 00:58:49,215
I think

1075
00:58:49,471 --> 00:58:50,239
If I had to

1076
00:58:50,495 --> 00:58:51,007
Gap

1077
00:58:51,263 --> 00:58:53,055
I don't think he really believes

1078
00:58:53,311 --> 00:58:54,847
This is true

1079
00:58:55,103 --> 00:58:55,615
Because it's

1080
00:58:55,871 --> 00:58:56,383
Ludacris

1081
00:58:56,895 --> 00:58:59,455
Is trying to spread more

1082
00:58:59,711 --> 00:59:00,991
Ear of public schools

1083
00:59:01,503 --> 00:59:05,599
By being like whenever you put them in there they all think

1084
00:59:10,207 --> 00:59:11,231
It's more that you can

1085
00:59:14,303 --> 00:59:15,071
Do whatever you want to do

1086
00:59:16,863 --> 00:59:17,375
Whenever you

1087
00:59:17,887 --> 00:59:18,655
Give over

1088
00:59:18,911 --> 00:59:19,423
You've already

1089
00:59:19,679 --> 00:59:22,495
Maybe if they're in the school giving up

1090
00:59:22,751 --> 00:59:26,079
Guardianship to the school

1091
00:59:28,127 --> 00:59:28,639
Somebody had

1092
00:59:31,455 --> 00:59:31,967
Pastor recognized

1093
00:59:32,223 --> 00:59:32,991
Yeah

1094
00:59:33,247 --> 00:59:33,759
It's very,

1095
00:59:35,551 --> 00:59:36,575
Now

1096
00:59:36,831 --> 00:59:40,415
There are shades of legal guardianship

1097
00:59:41,695 --> 00:59:42,975
Hey you're in the classroom

1098
00:59:43,231 --> 00:59:45,535
Kid dies on your watch

1099
00:59:45,791 --> 00:59:48,607
You are responsible

1100
00:59:48,863 --> 00:59:49,887
To that extent

1101
00:59:51,167 --> 00:59:52,447
Alex's describe

1102
00:59:52,959 --> 00:59:54,495
This is Chris level of

1103
00:59:59,615 --> 01:00:05,503
Given transitive

1104
01:00:05,759 --> 01:00:06,271
Your rights

1105
01:00:06,527 --> 01:00:07,039
Responsibility

1106
01:00:08,319 --> 01:00:10,879
Imagines it's like

1107
01:00:12,927 --> 01:00:18,047
Mr. Weatherbee wish people would read those terms of service Apple agree

1108
01:00:18,303 --> 01:00:21,375
Because if you download music from the iTunes

1109
01:00:22,399 --> 01:00:24,959
In those terms in agreement

1110
01:00:25,983 --> 01:00:26,751
They can also hate

1111
01:00:28,799 --> 01:00:30,079
Come over to Tim Cook

1112
01:00:30,335 --> 01:00:31,871
Banana

1113
01:00:33,407 --> 01:00:33,919
What he believes

1114
01:00:35,199 --> 01:00:35,967
Game of this

1115
01:00:39,551 --> 01:00:40,575
It's very weird

1116
01:00:40,831 --> 01:00:41,855
Cuz he starts making some

1117
01:00:42,111 --> 01:00:42,623
Complaints

1118
01:00:44,415 --> 01:00:45,439
That he's afraid of

1119
01:00:46,207 --> 01:00:50,815
But at the same time

1120
01:00:51,071 --> 01:00:52,351
Your parent if you go to the school

1121
01:00:52,607 --> 01:00:54,911
They should be totally fine doing these things

1122
01:00:55,167 --> 01:00:55,679
They are not

1123
01:01:01,823 --> 01:01:02,847
Terrible transgression

1124
01:01:03,359 --> 01:01:03,871
At the school's make

1125
01:01:04,127 --> 01:01:04,639
Andy's Auto

1126
01:01:05,919 --> 01:01:06,687
Please

1127
01:01:06,943 --> 01:01:07,711
Anxi

1128
01:01:07,967 --> 01:01:14,111
And and and and and and Bayton switches and she'll games and scams

1129
01:01:15,647 --> 01:01:19,231
School District

1130
01:01:25,631 --> 01:01:26,911
Dodgeball

1131
01:01:37,407 --> 01:01:43,295
And now the teachers aren't allowed to touch him or talk to him

1132
01:01:51,487 --> 01:01:53,535
I think this is socialist at the movies

1133
01:01:53,791 --> 01:01:54,303
Cedar level

1134
01:01:54,559 --> 01:01:55,583
Imagine scenarios

1135
01:01:55,839 --> 01:01:59,679
First they came for my dodgeball

1136
01:01:59,935 --> 01:02:00,703
For I didn't have an R

1137
01:02:02,495 --> 01:02:03,007
Schools

1138
01:02:03,263 --> 01:02:03,775
Definitely

1139
01:02:04,799 --> 01:02:05,311
Majority of them

1140
01:02:05,567 --> 01:02:06,079
From what I've been able to

1141
01:02:06,591 --> 01:02:08,639
That don't have dodgeball

1142
01:02:08,895 --> 01:02:09,663
As part of their

1143
01:02:09,919 --> 01:02:10,431
Curriculum

1144
01:02:10,687 --> 01:02:11,455
In

1145
01:02:11,711 --> 01:02:15,551
Jim I'm really fine with that

1146
01:02:16,831 --> 01:02:19,903
Through a lot

1147
01:02:20,159 --> 01:02:26,303
It was the sort of thing where people got hurt whether it was from taking a ball to the Head falling over hitting her head on the ground

1148
01:02:26,815 --> 01:02:30,655
Or trying to.

1149
01:02:30,911 --> 01:02:33,471
Right

1150
01:02:33,983 --> 01:02:38,079
There are other ways to get Recreation this is clearly

1151
01:02:41,151 --> 01:02:41,919
Violent J

1152
01:02:42,175 --> 01:02:48,319
Well there's always always the kid who is playing the game as a bad actor

1153
01:02:48,575 --> 01:02:50,367
Like I'm here

1154
01:02:50,623 --> 01:02:51,391
It out

1155
01:02:53,183 --> 01:02:53,951
Running

1156
01:02:56,511 --> 01:02:57,279
The only things I was able

1157
01:02:57,535 --> 01:02:58,047
Go to find where

1158
01:02:58,559 --> 01:03:00,863
There are some schools that have band

1159
01:03:01,119 --> 01:03:02,143
Running

1160
01:03:03,935 --> 01:03:10,079
Running

1161
01:03:10,335 --> 01:03:11,871
I don't know if

1162
01:03:12,127 --> 01:03:13,919
Rose to that level

1163
01:03:15,455 --> 01:03:15,967
Going to

1164
01:03:16,223 --> 01:03:16,991
Recent orders

1165
01:03:19,295 --> 01:03:20,831
I think Alex is talking here about the

1166
01:03:22,111 --> 01:03:22,623
Hangzhou

1167
01:03:22,879 --> 01:03:24,927
Is the number schools

1168
01:03:27,231 --> 01:03:27,743
Sports games

1169
01:03:28,255 --> 01:03:30,815
Without exception all these schools because of

1170
01:03:31,071 --> 01:03:32,351
Breaking out between

1171
01:03:34,143 --> 01:03:38,495
The Kentucky High School Athletic Association got rid of post

1172
01:03:39,007 --> 01:03:39,519
Doesn't count

1173
01:03:39,775 --> 01:03:40,287
Temptations

1174
01:03:42,335 --> 01:03:47,711
Even in that orders out the association

1175
01:03:47,967 --> 01:03:50,783
But we're required to report

1176
01:03:51,039 --> 01:03:52,063
Mayor come about

1177
01:03:52,319 --> 01:03:52,831
Because of that to say

1178
01:04:03,071 --> 01:04:04,607
I do grieve

1179
01:04:04,863 --> 01:04:06,143
But it's not like one SKU

1180
01:04:06,655 --> 01:04:10,495
You don't say

1181
01:04:12,031 --> 01:04:13,823
Decision but I also don't think it's like

1182
01:04:14,591 --> 01:04:20,735
Why didn't they act way sooner I kind of assumed it was like

1183
01:04:20,991 --> 01:04:24,063
Ariel

1184
01:04:27,391 --> 01:04:29,439
Completely voluntary non-binding

1185
01:04:30,975 --> 01:04:33,023
Sure

1186
01:04:33,535 --> 01:04:34,559
You can

1187
01:04:34,815 --> 01:04:35,839
If people

1188
01:04:36,095 --> 01:04:37,119
If you have faith

1189
01:04:37,631 --> 01:04:38,911
You can have your student

1190
01:04:39,167 --> 01:04:39,679
Not fight with

1191
01:04:40,703 --> 01:04:41,215
Do it

1192
01:04:43,007 --> 01:04:43,775
Don't do it

1193
01:04:44,287 --> 01:04:45,567
Yeah

1194
01:04:45,823 --> 01:04:49,407
Also I bet those kids who keep getting into fights

1195
01:04:49,663 --> 01:04:51,711
Probably

1196
01:04:52,479 --> 01:04:53,247
Just pointing that out

1197
01:04:55,039 --> 01:04:57,599
In 1994 Ventura County Schools

1198
01:04:57,855 --> 01:04:59,135
Post

1199
01:05:03,487 --> 01:05:03,999
Free game

1200
01:05:04,255 --> 01:05:06,047
To pervert preserve Sports

1201
01:05:06,559 --> 01:05:09,375
It wasn't

1202
01:05:12,191 --> 01:05:12,703
But

1203
01:05:12,959 --> 01:05:14,751
There wouldn't be any different

1204
01:05:15,007 --> 01:05:16,543
After the match

1205
01:05:16,799 --> 01:05:17,823
They just did it for sportsmanship

1206
01:05:18,847 --> 01:05:24,223
Mike talking about the Quest Academy

1207
01:05:24,479 --> 01:05:24,991
And England

1208
01:05:25,247 --> 01:05:27,551
That could be what he's talking about the possible

1209
01:05:29,855 --> 01:05:30,367
Google contact

1210
01:05:31,391 --> 01:05:32,671
Early 2011

1211
01:05:32,927 --> 01:05:34,207
An attempt to cut down on Bully

1212
01:05:34,719 --> 01:05:35,743
That might be what he's talking

1213
01:05:37,023 --> 01:05:38,303
Cast and crew

1214
01:05:48,543 --> 01:05:50,335
Nothing to do with anything

1215
01:05:52,127 --> 01:05:57,247
Further notice

1216
01:06:08,767 --> 01:06:10,559
It seems like it's just a vague

1217
01:06:11,327 --> 01:06:12,351
Preservation of what

1218
01:06:12,607 --> 01:06:14,655
He thinks is the idea of masculinity

1219
01:06:15,423 --> 01:06:18,239
I think that's really all it is

1220
01:06:18,495 --> 01:06:20,799
Horrible version of masculinity does involve

1221
01:06:21,055 --> 01:06:27,199
You get out of line blow your hot child you get out of line the coaches going to punch you 10 times

1222
01:06:27,455 --> 01:06:28,735
Great break your jaw

1223
01:06:28,991 --> 01:06:32,063
I don't know

1224
01:06:33,599 --> 01:06:34,367
And somebody ten times

1225
01:06:34,623 --> 01:06:36,415
Sooner or later

1226
01:06:41,023 --> 01:06:42,047
That's possible

1227
01:06:42,815 --> 01:06:43,839
Now we're done

1228
01:06:44,095 --> 01:06:45,119
For now with the

1229
01:06:45,631 --> 01:06:47,167
Google fi

1230
01:06:47,423 --> 01:06:48,191
Issue

1231
01:06:50,751 --> 01:06:52,031
It's the way that Alex

1232
01:06:52,287 --> 01:06:52,799
So

1233
01:06:53,055 --> 01:06:53,567
It gives

1234
01:06:53,823 --> 01:06:55,359
Give me Gibbs

1235
01:06:55,871 --> 01:06:58,175
He's a completely random.

1236
01:06:58,431 --> 01:07:04,575
If we go back to our talking about I was great for teachers to hit kids you never expect

1237
01:07:04,831 --> 01:07:07,135
Did that

1238
01:07:07,391 --> 01:07:09,183
And now we get another unexpected

1239
01:07:12,767 --> 01:07:13,791
Clock

The matter for another day

1253
01:07:55,519 --> 01:07:56,031
I'm passing it

1254
01:07:57,055 --> 01:07:57,823
He doesn't swipe

1255
01:07:58,079 --> 01:07:59,615
Fairplay

1256
01:07:59,871 --> 01:08:00,383
Was created

1257
01:08:00,639 --> 01:08:01,407
Can epoxy resin

1258
01:08:04,479 --> 01:08:04,991
It was

1259
01:08:06,015 --> 01:08:06,783
Absolutely

1260
01:08:07,039 --> 01:08:08,575
Isn't that

1261
01:08:09,087 --> 01:08:10,367
And I'd like to save that for

1262
01:08:10,623 --> 01:08:11,647
We actually talked about it

1263
01:08:14,975 --> 01:08:15,743
I do

1264
01:08:15,999 --> 01:08:22,143
Realize that started in 2011

1265
01:08:22,399 --> 01:08:28,543
They had a Nightly News show parent night started in robbed

1266
01:08:29,311 --> 01:08:31,359
But I really thought that it was going on

1267
01:08:33,407 --> 01:08:34,943
I thought there was a

1268
01:08:35,199 --> 01:08:35,967
How could it be

1269
01:08:36,479 --> 01:08:39,551
In the evenings Jason

1270
01:08:39,807 --> 01:08:42,623
So yeah I guess that was just a unexamined assumptions

1271
01:08:42,879 --> 01:08:44,159
Send that I had that in fortnite

1272
01:08:45,695 --> 01:08:47,999
Is it still going

1273
01:08:49,791 --> 01:08:55,423
Instagram fashion

1274
01:08:55,679 --> 01:08:57,215
No.

1275
01:08:57,471 --> 01:09:01,567
He kept saying he was going to make it 24 hours

1276
01:09:02,847 --> 01:09:06,175
The on-air Talent

1277
01:09:07,711 --> 01:09:11,039
He used to back in 2009 almost every episode ends with him

1278
01:09:12,319 --> 01:09:15,391
Re promoting happened earlier in the show

1279
01:09:15,647 --> 01:09:18,975
Is he

1280
01:09:19,231 --> 01:09:20,511

1281

Where they were

1282
01:09:21,535 --> 01:09:22,047
Play it in

1283
01:09:27,167 --> 01:09:28,191
Who plays

1284
01:09:28,447 --> 01:09:29,215
Rebroadcast

1285
01:09:29,471 --> 01:09:32,543
Hotel California

1286
01:09:34,335 --> 01:09:35,615
Lookouts could do that now

1287
01:09:35,871 --> 01:09:36,639
But he knows that

1288
01:09:36,895 --> 01:09:37,407
It's not worth it

1289
01:09:37,663 --> 01:09:39,455
The resources that he has

1290
01:09:40,223 --> 01:09:40,735
Enough to make

1291
01:09:41,759 --> 01:09:42,527
Actual different

1292
01:09:44,063 --> 01:09:45,087
The rest of the day

1293
01:09:47,391 --> 01:09:47,903
Which I guess is

1294
01:09:51,743 --> 01:09:56,351
Yeah better for all

1295
01:09:56,863 --> 01:09:59,167
We got off on that

1296
01:10:00,191 --> 01:10:01,471
Diversion

1297
01:10:01,727 --> 01:10:02,495
Teachers hitting kids

1298
01:10:04,543 --> 01:10:05,567
The painter Alex

1299
01:10:05,823 --> 01:10:07,359
Yeah he comes on

1300
01:10:11,967 --> 01:10:12,479
Government

1301
01:10:15,039 --> 01:10:16,319
Prediction about selling

1302
01:10:17,343 --> 01:10:18,111
Chase Bank on fire

1303
01:10:26,815 --> 01:10:29,375
Scene 75

1304
01:10:41,663 --> 01:10:42,431
For 25,000

1305
01:10:42,687 --> 01:10:47,295
Which is first of all waste by 60%

1306
01:10:47,551 --> 01:10:49,087
His prediction was with his

1307
01:10:49,343 --> 01:10:50,111
His listeners all like

1308
01:10:50,367 --> 01:10:50,879
Lycoming in

1309
01:10:51,135 --> 01:10:52,159
Set still crazy

1310
01:10:52,671 --> 01:10:57,023
Tell Alex the story of

1311
01:10:57,791 --> 01:10:59,071
Altercation

1312
01:11:01,119 --> 01:11:01,631
I'm fair to say

1313
01:11:01,887 --> 01:11:02,655
Interaction

1314
01:11:02,911 --> 01:11:03,679
With the police

1315
01:11:08,799 --> 01:11:10,591
I mean I think the

1316
01:11:10,847 --> 01:11:12,639
I think that the officers

1317
01:11:12,895 --> 01:11:16,735
Ridiculous

1318
01:11:23,391 --> 01:11:27,487
I thought it was funny that they line

1319
01:11:27,743 --> 01:11:30,559
Beard

1320
01:11:35,679 --> 01:11:38,495
Homeland Security

1321
01:11:40,799 --> 01:11:42,847
Except probably

1322
01:11:43,103 --> 01:11:44,639
Talk to me

1323
01:11:44,895 --> 01:11:46,175
Whatever he's on the no-fly list

1324
01:11:46,431 --> 01:11:52,319
The police did end up coming to his house shortly thereafter

1325
01:11:52,575 --> 01:11:53,087
Even Peyton

1326
01:11:53,599 --> 01:11:56,159
It was a formal check-in

1327
01:11:56,927 --> 01:11:58,719
Report to someone

1328
01:11:59,231 --> 01:12:00,255
People who showed up

1329
01:12:01,023 --> 01:12:03,071
Yeah it's weird but we just kind of have to check it out

1330
01:12:06,143 --> 01:12:08,191
You know we got to fill out the paperwork that we were here

1331
01:12:08,447 --> 01:12:09,727
Find your cool

1332
01:12:09,983 --> 01:12:11,519
I don't know why they check back in

1333
01:12:13,055 --> 01:12:14,591
That seems like

1334
01:12:16,383 --> 01:12:21,503
I don't know maybe they have to according to their guidelines or whatever

1335
01:12:21,759 --> 01:12:24,319
I just best practices whatever

1336
01:12:24,575 --> 01:12:25,599
Was like

1337
01:12:26,623 --> 01:12:27,647
Superbad

1338
01:12:28,159 --> 01:12:28,927
Friendly

1339
01:12:37,631 --> 01:12:43,775
Play okay that's fine I guess what we got an Xfinity store

1340
01:12:44,031 --> 01:12:46,079
Everybody's fine with that

1341
01:12:46,591 --> 01:12:49,407
I don't I don't I don't know

1342
01:12:49,663 --> 01:12:50,431

His plight anime $25,000

1344
01:12:54,527 --> 01:12:55,295
Yeah whatever

1345
01:12:55,807 --> 01:12:59,391
He went that German did wind up eating him and the painting

1346
01:12:59,903 --> 01:13:02,463
Yeah we don't we don't know what happened actually I dunno what happened

1347
01:13:04,255 --> 01:13:04,767
He ended up

1348
01:13:05,023 --> 01:13:05,535
Getting arrested again

1349
01:13:07,327 --> 01:13:09,887
Try to push the boundaries

1350
01:13:10,143 --> 01:13:13,727
Totally got himself arrested

1351
01:13:14,495 --> 01:13:20,639
I'm not sure I dislike him necessarily he's alright

1352
01:13:22,175 --> 01:13:26,783
The only thing is that you showed up on Infowars and was verbally

1353
01:13:28,063 --> 01:13:29,087
Supportive of Al

1354
01:13:31,647 --> 01:13:32,671
The rest of the stuff seems like

1355
01:13:33,183 --> 01:13:34,463
Have a good to see him trying to

1356
01:13:35,487 --> 01:13:40,607
Buzz Marketing or something probably

1357
01:13:41,375 --> 01:13:42,655
425 Grand

1358
01:13:42,911 --> 01:13:46,751
Of course you're going to start s*** from there on out

1359
01:13:47,007 --> 01:13:53,151
It's like it's like

1360
01:13:53,407 --> 01:13:58,783
Geo detention

1361
01:14:01,343 --> 01:14:02,367
Difficult

1362
01:14:02,623 --> 01:14:03,391
The show necessarily

1363
01:14:03,647 --> 01:14:04,415
I feel like I have

1364
01:14:06,207 --> 01:14:06,719
Real

1365
01:14:07,487 --> 01:14:09,535
911

1366
01:14:10,047 --> 01:14:10,559
Responders

1367
01:14:11,327 --> 01:14:14,143
Okay about how

1368
01:14:14,399 --> 01:14:15,679
The Bloomberg

1369
01:14:16,191 --> 01:14:18,751
New York exempt

1370
01:14:19,519 --> 01:14:20,287
Anniversary

1371
01:14:24,383 --> 01:14:24,895
Yeah

1372
01:14:25,151 --> 01:14:26,431
I've mixed with about it

1373
01:14:26,687 --> 01:14:28,479
We're not going to listen to a lot of

1374
01:14:29,247 --> 01:14:30,015
I just have one clip

1375
01:14:30,271 --> 01:14:31,039
And that is Alex

1376
01:14:31,551 --> 01:14:32,063
That really

1377
01:14:32,831 --> 01:14:33,343
Really f****** it

1378
01:14:34,367 --> 01:14:38,719
Specifically

1379
01:15:00,735 --> 01:15:01,759
Did you get the other guy on the phone

1380
01:15:03,295 --> 01:15:05,855
But it'll

1381
01:15:06,111 --> 01:15:06,879
Pretty close to

1382
01:15:07,135 --> 01:15:07,647
Realtree

1383
01:15:07,903 --> 01:15:08,415
Beautiful story

1384
01:15:09,183 --> 01:15:10,463
He has these 2911 for

1385
01:15:10,719 --> 01:15:11,231
First Responders

1386
01:15:11,487 --> 01:15:12,255
Gas discount

1387
01:15:12,511 --> 01:15:14,303
You're not invited to the ceremony

1388
01:15:14,559 --> 01:15:16,095
0

1389
01:15:16,351 --> 01:15:16,863
This interview because

1390
01:15:17,119 --> 01:15:17,887
Because it puts me in a position

1391
01:15:19,935 --> 01:15:21,215
On the way

1392
01:15:21,471 --> 01:15:21,983
Respect for people

1393
01:15:22,239 --> 01:15:24,287
Who put their lives

1394
01:15:24,799 --> 01:15:25,567
Terrible

1395
01:15:26,591 --> 01:15:27,103
I don't want it

1396
01:15:28,127 --> 01:15:28,639
I don't

1397
01:15:28,895 --> 01:15:29,663
On the other hand

1398
01:15:29,919 --> 01:15:30,943
These guys and Alex

1399
01:15:31,199 --> 01:15:32,735
Have a very Twisted take on what's go

1400
01:15:36,319 --> 01:15:38,879
The First Responders work

1401
01:15:39,135 --> 01:15:39,647
Space

1402
01:15:40,671 --> 01:15:42,463
And at the victims family members

1403
01:15:42,719 --> 01:15:44,767
I am people who survived

1404
01:15:45,023 --> 01:15:45,791
Hire priority

1405
01:15:46,303 --> 01:15:47,839
I think that's a weak excuse

1406
01:15:48,095 --> 01:15:48,863
But ultimately

1407
01:15:49,119 --> 01:15:49,887
Could have been the truth

1408
01:15:50,143 --> 01:15:51,935
Zuccotti Park

1409
01:15:52,191 --> 01:15:53,471
New York there might not

1410
01:15:53,727 --> 01:15:55,007
Have been rude within the

1411
01:15:55,263 --> 01:15:56,543
Space that they would have cordoned off

1412
01:15:57,311 --> 01:15:58,847
I still think that's probably disrespect

1413
01:15:59,871 --> 01:16:02,175
First Responders

1414
01:16:02,431 --> 01:16:02,943
You're there

1415
01:16:03,199 --> 01:16:06,527
Yeah I never miss an opportunity Bloomberg

1416
01:16:09,855 --> 01:16:13,183
But speaking all the interview

1417
01:16:13,439 --> 01:16:14,207
The show

1418
01:16:14,463 --> 01:16:15,487
Might be

1419
01:16:15,743 --> 01:16:16,255
Chivas or two types

1420
01:16:16,767 --> 01:16:19,071
Disrupt the event talking about building 7

1421
01:16:19,583 --> 01:16:20,351
And that sort of thing

1422
01:16:21,631 --> 01:16:22,399
Be fine with it

1423
01:16:23,935 --> 01:16:24,703
Individual basis

1424
01:16:27,007 --> 01:16:27,519
Because

1425
01:16:28,031 --> 01:16:29,055
Even if they are going to

1426
01:16:29,311 --> 01:16:31,103
Disrupt I'm not sure I think

1427
01:16:31,359 --> 01:16:32,383
Appropriate

1428
01:16:33,919 --> 01:16:36,991
I don't know I'm glad I never have to make that right

1429
01:16:37,247 --> 01:16:41,343
It is it is

1430
01:16:41,855 --> 01:16:42,879
When he was running

1431
01:16:43,135 --> 01:16:44,159
The Daily Show

1432
01:16:44,415 --> 01:16:48,255
This dude one of the guys who's being interviewed this Joey God we finally get them on the phone

1433
01:16:48,767 --> 01:16:54,911
Better

1434
01:16:56,447 --> 01:16:58,751
Of course

1435
01:16:59,007 --> 01:17:01,311
Responder because he brings up John Stewart

1436
01:17:01,567 --> 01:17:04,383
Political

1437
01:17:04,639 --> 01:17:09,759
So so it is absolutely like a thing where if you guys had done

1438
01:17:10,015 --> 01:17:10,527
F******

1439
01:17:10,783 --> 01:17:12,831
At the very least

1440
01:17:13,087 --> 01:17:14,623
Cumin decent things

1441
01:17:14,879 --> 01:17:16,159
To do which is

1442
01:17:16,415 --> 01:17:18,975
Take care of these people who

1443
01:17:20,767 --> 01:17:22,303
Arguable Heroes

1444
01:17:24,351 --> 01:17:26,143
If you're just taking care of them

1445
01:17:26,911 --> 01:17:31,263
Maybe the whole 9/11 was staged thing probably wouldn't get it

1446
01:17:31,519 --> 01:17:32,287
Fart with

1447
01:17:32,799 --> 01:17:33,567
Yeah exactly

1448
01:17:33,823 --> 01:17:35,871
I misspoke a little bit

1449
01:17:36,127 --> 01:17:36,895
Because

1450
01:17:38,175 --> 01:17:39,711
Unfairly

1451
01:17:39,967 --> 01:17:40,479
These to do

1452
01:17:43,039 --> 01:17:46,111
911 truth

1453
01:17:49,439 --> 01:17:50,719
It probably would disrupt

1454
01:17:52,255 --> 01:17:53,023
Is very

1455
01:17:53,279 --> 01:17:54,559
Which is to speak out about

1456
01:17:54,815 --> 01:18:00,191
The lack of healthcare the disruptive aspect of it

1457
01:18:00,447 --> 01:18:01,983
Probably didn't want to

1458
01:18:02,239 --> 01:18:04,031
Right

1459
01:18:04,799 --> 01:18:05,567
But you understand

1460
01:18:05,823 --> 01:18:06,591
Why

1461
01:18:06,847 --> 01:18:07,359
He would do

1462
01:18:07,871 --> 01:18:13,759
Right

1463
01:18:14,015 --> 01:18:14,783
Call to answer

1464
01:18:15,039 --> 01:18:18,367
For that absolutely

1465
01:18:18,623 --> 01:18:19,903
How much is a wrong person to do

1466
01:18:20,415 --> 01:18:22,975
Absolutely

1467
01:18:25,023 --> 01:18:25,535
It's so much on

1468
01:18:26,815 --> 01:18:27,327
Like that

1469
01:18:28,607 --> 01:18:29,375
Piercing narrative

1470
01:18:29,631 --> 01:18:30,911
I really don't

1471
01:18:31,167 --> 01:18:31,679
Don't have it in me

1472
01:18:32,447 --> 01:18:32,959
2

1473
01:18:35,007 --> 01:18:37,055
9/11 First Responders

1474
01:18:38,079 --> 01:18:43,711
But they're probably big-picture right about with the small matters

1475
01:18:43,967 --> 01:18:44,735
To point out like

1476
01:18:45,247 --> 01:18:51,135
I understand why he would do that

1477
01:18:51,391 --> 01:18:54,207
Entirely possible that

1478
01:18:54,463 --> 01:18:57,279
Just like so many guests we have on Alex there like

1479
01:18:57,535 --> 01:19:00,607
Order to get out their message

1480
01:19:00,863 --> 01:19:04,447
Like it's entirely possible these dudes were going along with the whole

1481
01:19:04,703 --> 01:19:09,823
911 is an inside job here shaking your head

1482
01:19:11,103 --> 01:19:14,175
Brought up John Stewart

1483
01:19:16,223 --> 01:19:16,735
The other guy

1484
01:19:17,247 --> 01:19:18,015
Toddler Ted

1485
01:19:19,039 --> 01:19:19,551
He was pretty

1486
01:19:19,807 --> 01:19:20,831
Please party on that tip

1487
01:19:21,087 --> 01:19:23,903
I'm still fine with them going on Infowars to spread that message

1488
01:19:24,159 --> 01:19:28,255
I'm fine with them going on any show to spread the message of like

1489
01:19:28,511 --> 01:19:29,023
Hey there

1490
01:19:29,279 --> 01:19:30,303
F****** ass over

1491
01:19:30,559 --> 01:19:32,351
And we're actually Heroes

1492
01:19:32,607 --> 01:19:34,143
Maybe think about that

1493
01:19:34,911 --> 01:19:36,959
You know that's why it stopped

1494
01:19:39,007 --> 01:19:39,775
Yeah I want to listen

1495
01:19:40,031 --> 01:19:41,567
Intuit

1496
01:19:42,079 --> 01:19:43,103
Alex

1497
01:19:44,383 --> 01:19:44,895
Who's the starting again

1498
01:19:45,919 --> 01:19:46,431
You try to promote

1499
01:19:47,711 --> 01:19:48,479
He's got a big

1500
01:19:49,247 --> 01:19:50,527
With the CEO of Gibson

1501
01:19:54,623 --> 01:19:56,927
And they weren't in trouble

1502
01:19:57,439 --> 01:19:59,743
And I Alex Corte interview with Co

1503
01:20:01,535 --> 01:20:02,047
Throws it

1504
01:20:02,303 --> 01:20:02,815
To that interview

1505
01:20:04,095 --> 01:20:04,863
Caesar

1506
01:20:05,119 --> 01:20:05,631
For tonight

1507
01:20:05,887 --> 01:20:06,399
The debut

1508
01:20:06,655 --> 01:20:07,423
Open fortnite

1509
01:20:08,447 --> 01:20:14,592
American jobs

1510
01:20:22,016 --> 01:20:28,160
Broadcast

1511
01:20:28,416 --> 01:20:32,000
Red wine basket

1512
01:20:32,512 --> 01:20:34,048
No clip

1513
01:20:36,096 --> 01:20:38,656
Destroyed

1514
01:20:38,912 --> 01:20:45,056
Tiermaker

1515
01:20:46,080 --> 01:20:47,360
Joey says that they

1516
01:20:47,616 --> 01:20:49,920
The courts told him you should do business in Madagascar

1517
01:20:50,176 --> 01:20:51,200
You should move to Madagascar

1518
01:20:54,784 --> 01:21:00,928
Better off doing business in Madagascar was illegally imported

1519
01:21:01,184 --> 01:21:04,256
From Madagascar from India

1520
01:21:06,048 --> 01:21:06,560
Guitars

1521
01:21:06,816 --> 01:21:09,376
But they couldn't legally been used

1522
01:21:15,264 --> 01:21:16,800
There's a lot called

1523
01:21:18,848 --> 01:21:20,128
They were in violation

1524
01:21:20,896 --> 01:21:23,200
Using using my gold stuff like that

1525
01:21:23,456 --> 01:21:29,600
In Madagascar

1526
01:21:29,856 --> 01:21:32,416
None of it is itself illegal to possess

1527
01:21:33,184 --> 01:21:36,256
But exported out of Madagascar or India would be

1528
01:21:36,512 --> 01:21:38,560
Illegal in the Lacey act makes

1529
01:21:38,816 --> 01:21:39,584
Illegal to traffic

1530
01:21:39,840 --> 01:21:40,352
Florida

1531
01:21:40,608 --> 01:21:42,400
That would be illegal according to

1532
01:21:42,656 --> 01:21:43,168
Before in-laws

1533
01:21:44,192 --> 01:21:46,752
70 is Flora or fauna

1534
01:21:47,264 --> 01:21:50,080
It's covered under the Lacey Act

1535
01:21:50,336 --> 01:21:54,944
I mean

1536
01:21:55,200 --> 01:21:55,712
He's weird

1537
01:21:55,968 --> 01:22:02,112
Literally Gali smuggled out of country

1538
01:22:03,392 --> 01:22:07,488
It's not like ebony comes from a f****** I don't know that it's

1539
01:22:08,512 --> 01:22:14,144
The ebony was

1540
01:22:14,400 --> 01:22:16,448
2011 ebony might have been

1541
01:22:16,704 --> 01:22:17,472
The first raid

1542
01:22:17,728 --> 01:22:18,752
And then the Rosewood

1543
01:22:19,008 --> 01:22:21,824
Both from India and Madagascar where the second

1544
01:22:22,080 --> 01:22:24,128
The Madagascar was also the source of the devil

1545
01:22:24,896 --> 01:22:25,920
Little confusing

1546
01:22:26,688 --> 01:22:27,712
Like where were they getting

1547
01:22:27,968 --> 01:22:29,248
There

1548
01:22:29,504 --> 01:22:31,808
Spypoint does Renee

1549
01:22:33,600 --> 01:22:34,368
The local laws

1550
01:22:34,624 --> 01:22:36,672
In the country that they were sourcing it from

1551
01:22:36,928 --> 01:22:38,720
And the Lacey act makes it illegal for them

1552
01:22:38,976 --> 01:22:44,608
To do that sourcing got you cuz of those countries

1553
01:22:44,864 --> 01:22:45,632
Big deal out of this

1554
01:22:48,960 --> 01:22:55,104
Jobs in America

1555
01:22:55,360 --> 01:22:56,384
Dab going to Madagascar

1556
01:22:56,640 --> 01:23:00,480
He's coming on Infowars nightly

1557
01:23:00,736 --> 01:23:02,528
They couldn't get the clip together for this

1558
01:23:03,040 --> 01:23:03,552
It does exist

1559
01:23:08,672 --> 01:23:13,280
Gibson would plead guilty and pay a $300,000 fine in August 2012

1560
01:23:13,536 --> 01:23:19,680
So they ended up

1561
01:23:19,936 --> 01:23:21,472
Do use the Shaggy defense in a court of law

1562
01:23:25,312 --> 01:23:26,080
Provide cover

1563
01:23:26,336 --> 01:23:28,128
Maker

1564
01:23:28,640 --> 01:23:30,176
Guitar

1565
01:23:32,736 --> 01:23:34,272
We're coming towards the end of it

1566
01:23:34,528 --> 01:23:35,808
And

1567
01:23:37,856 --> 01:23:38,368
The first one

1568
01:23:40,160 --> 01:23:40,672
You've discovered

1569
01:23:40,928 --> 01:23:41,440
Over the course of the

1570
01:23:42,208 --> 01:23:43,488
That Alex has a

1571
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:45,024
Fit of love

1572
01:23:46,048 --> 01:23:46,560
The authority

1573
01:23:48,096 --> 01:23:49,120
He's a fascist

1574
01:23:50,144 --> 01:23:52,192
Well the same time being a libertarian

1575
01:23:52,448 --> 01:23:52,960
Which makes

1576
01:23:53,216 --> 01:23:53,728
Perfect sense

1577
01:23:53,984 --> 01:23:54,496
Turtleson

1578
01:23:54,752 --> 01:23:55,264
Not to contradict

1579
01:23:55,520 --> 01:24:00,128
Actually most Libertarians are somewhat fashion

1580
01:24:03,200 --> 01:24:03,712
Is the gateway to

1581
01:24:06,784 --> 01:24:10,880
In this next clip there's a situation going on geopolitical

1582
01:24:11,136 --> 01:24:12,672
Moammar Kadafi

1583
01:24:14,464 --> 01:24:18,304
Oh I thought this was one that was an international

1584
01:24:19,584 --> 01:24:20,096
But

1585
01:24:20,352 --> 01:24:20,864
Alex

1586
01:24:21,376 --> 01:24:21,888
Uncle

1587
01:24:23,168 --> 01:24:29,312
No surrender

1588
01:24:46,976 --> 01:24:49,280
Or cowardly scum

1589
01:24:55,168 --> 01:24:59,264
There's something respectful about a dictator who will actually fight

1590
01:25:00,032 --> 01:25:06,176
Jordan to the history of moammar Kadafi

1591
01:25:06,688 --> 01:25:08,736
But let's just remind people this episode

1592
01:25:08,992 --> 01:25:10,272
From September 2011

1593
01:25:11,296 --> 01:25:15,392
Mere months earlier the telegraph reported thick toffee was firing on civilians

1594
01:25:15,904 --> 01:25:16,416
Quotes

1595
01:25:16,672 --> 01:25:22,816
Unimaginable

1596
01:25:23,072 --> 01:25:27,168
Quote warplanes and helicopters are indiscriminate bombing one area after another

1597
01:25:27,424 --> 01:25:28,960
There are many many dead

1598
01:25:29,216 --> 01:25:30,240
Our people are dying

1599
01:25:30,496 --> 01:25:32,288
It's a policy of scorched-earth

1600
01:25:33,056 --> 01:25:38,432
After the situation deteriorated and Kadafi had given an interview wear

1601
01:25:38,688 --> 01:25:39,968
Protect him

1602
01:25:40,224 --> 01:25:41,248
The International Community was

1603
01:25:41,504 --> 01:25:42,784
Really concerned about him

1604
01:25:43,040 --> 01:25:44,576
Chemical weapons on his own people

1605
01:25:45,088 --> 01:25:45,600
Because he had

1606
01:25:46,112 --> 01:25:46,880
Is mustard gas

1607
01:25:47,136 --> 01:25:49,184
But he didn't give up when

1608
01:25:49,952 --> 01:25:51,488
Do you like 14 tons of mustard

1609
01:25:51,744 --> 01:25:52,768
Forgot you know there's something

1610
01:25:53,024 --> 01:25:54,560
Sing respectable about

1611
01:25:55,584 --> 01:25:56,864
Prince MBS

1612
01:25:57,120 --> 01:26:00,960
Because you don't see a lot of royalty willing to kill journalist

1613
01:26:01,216 --> 01:26:02,496
Now and just remember that

1614
01:26:02,752 --> 01:26:04,544
18

1615
01:26:05,056 --> 01:26:10,944
Underwrite

1616
01:26:11,456 --> 01:26:12,736
Getting y

1617
01:26:12,992 --> 01:26:13,504
To be like

1618
01:26:13,760 --> 01:26:14,272
Cuz

1619
01:26:14,528 --> 01:26:17,344
He recognizes what the problems

1620
01:26:23,744 --> 01:26:26,304
You really don't

1621
01:26:26,816 --> 01:26:31,168
It's almost it's almost like he's he's a dictator murdering

1622
01:26:31,424 --> 01:26:35,776
Citizens of his country

1623
01:26:37,056 --> 01:26:38,336
The capital punishment

1624
01:26:38,592 --> 01:26:40,640
Punishment

1625
01:26:40,896 --> 01:26:42,176
I'm just like

1626
01:26:42,688 --> 01:26:48,832
You know what you gave up your rights when you decided to live there with that dictator so he has the right to kill you

1627
01:26:49,088 --> 01:26:55,232
I think

1628
01:26:56,000 --> 01:27:01,888
Somali pirates

1629
01:27:02,144 --> 01:27:03,168
Supporting dictators

1630
01:27:03,424 --> 01:27:05,472
In foreign countries when he's mister I love

1631
01:27:05,728 --> 01:27:06,752
Freedom

1632
01:27:07,008 --> 01:27:08,032
It does make sense today

1633
01:27:15,200 --> 01:27:17,760
You decided

1634
01:27:19,296 --> 01:27:20,064
SMS

1635
01:27:20,320 --> 01:27:21,088
God what an

1636
01:27:22,112 --> 01:27:23,392
He's pretty dumb idiot

1637
01:27:26,720 --> 01:27:27,232
Is

1638
01:27:28,256 --> 01:27:29,024
Before the episode

1639
01:27:29,536 --> 01:27:30,048
So

1640
01:27:30,560 --> 01:27:32,864
How do you say with a grain of salt about how he's going to get

1641
01:27:33,376 --> 01:27:36,704
People's calls are called

1642
01:27:36,960 --> 01:27:39,264
I got some other news which has been overloaded today

1643
01:27:40,032 --> 01:27:41,568
Would would happen

1644
01:27:46,432 --> 01:27:49,248
Fever last night of a sore throat

1645
01:27:49,504 --> 01:27:51,552
TV show

1646
01:27:52,576 --> 01:27:53,856
Almond

1647
01:27:54,112 --> 01:27:55,904
I know it's just going soon

1648
01:27:56,416 --> 01:27:59,232
All the map for today

1649
01:28:01,280 --> 01:28:02,048
Blaming having a

1650
01:28:02,304 --> 01:28:03,840
Fever for being all over the map

1651
01:28:04,096 --> 01:28:05,120
When I would say

1652
01:28:05,888 --> 01:28:08,448
He is one of the most focused I've ever seen

1653
01:28:08,704 --> 01:28:14,848
I was about to say so far we have here

1654
01:28:15,104 --> 01:28:21,248
Show me all over the map

1655
01:28:23,040 --> 01:28:24,576
It's cool that's pretty on point

1656
01:28:24,832 --> 01:28:27,136
You want to talk about

1657
01:28:27,392 --> 01:28:28,416
The corporal punishment

1658
01:28:31,744 --> 01:28:33,536
He did another half hour or so talking

1659
01:28:34,048 --> 01:28:34,816
911

1660
01:28:35,328 --> 01:28:38,656
Maybe a little bit more focused on that topic

1661
01:28:39,168 --> 01:28:41,472
Did a much shorter interview with

1662
01:28:43,776 --> 01:28:45,312
Just wanted to sound bite wanted a little

1663
01:28:46,848 --> 01:28:49,408
That sort of thing

1664
01:28:51,200 --> 01:28:52,480
Bismarck

1665
01:28:53,760 --> 01:28:54,528
Yeah I would say

1666
01:28:54,784 --> 01:28:55,808
The first hour were you stalking

1667
01:29:05,536 --> 01:29:09,888
Being off topic and all over the place when he is

1668
01:29:10,400 --> 01:29:16,032
Nothing but Alex without the flu for Alex with the flu is like early. Orson Welles

1669
01:29:16,544 --> 01:29:19,360
Alex without the flu is Orson Welles

1670
01:29:19,616 --> 01:29:22,176
In the commercial song

1671
01:29:23,712 --> 01:29:24,992
I don't know I just thought that was really weird

1672
01:29:25,504 --> 01:29:26,784
Photos of very strange

1673
01:29:27,040 --> 01:29:31,648
Restaurants in 5 minutes

1674
01:29:31,904 --> 01:29:35,488
You take out the last commercial break or whatever

1675
01:29:42,912 --> 01:29:47,776
Like a lack of self-awareness

1676
01:29:49,312 --> 01:29:55,200
Like I really don't like a question a lot of coincidences

1677
01:29:55,712 --> 01:30:01,856
It seems like you have to admit that some of your conspiracy what's even weirder is the

1678
01:30:02,112 --> 01:30:06,720
The thing that he's allowed to be a coincidence episode is something negative

1679
01:30:06,976 --> 01:30:07,744
Has befallen him

1680
01:30:08,256 --> 01:30:08,768
You got a few

1681
01:30:09,024 --> 01:30:15,168
None of the taxes working in the studio when he's trying to launch his show perfect scenario to be like

1682
01:30:15,424 --> 01:30:17,984
Sofia Vergara and everyone is disrupting my communication

1683
01:30:18,240 --> 01:30:23,104
This is Bell's palsy

1684
01:30:23,360 --> 01:30:25,664
The fact that he was able to get to the point

1685
01:30:26,176 --> 01:30:27,200
No big deal

1686
01:30:30,528 --> 01:30:33,088
The only time that he is

1687
01:30:33,344 --> 01:30:34,880
Free of his personal invented

1688
01:30:35,136 --> 01:30:35,648
Demon

1689
01:30:35,904 --> 01:30:36,672
Is when he gets up

1690
01:30:37,184 --> 01:30:38,208
We got to keep that boy

1691
01:30:41,792 --> 01:30:42,816
Alex

1692
01:30:44,352 --> 01:30:45,376
Keep your

1693
01:30:46,912 --> 01:30:48,192
Nothing I want to kill him

1694
01:30:48,704 --> 01:30:49,728
Like that but

1695
01:30:49,984 --> 01:30:53,824
With that for very long

1696
01:30:55,872 --> 01:30:57,408
You need to learn upgrade

1697
01:30:57,664 --> 01:30:59,200
Chronic condition

1698
01:30:59,456 --> 01:31:02,784
What about

1699
01:31:03,296 --> 01:31:05,600
Lyme disease

1700
01:31:05,856 --> 01:31:07,392
Yeah that's a chronic condition

1701
01:31:07,648 --> 01:31:08,160
Yeah

1702
01:31:10,464 --> 01:31:15,072
We settled on it let's get

1703
01:31:17,376 --> 01:31:20,704
The only way to keep him on

1704
01:31:20,960 --> 01:31:23,008
Fever hallucinations about socialist in movie

1705
01:31:23,264 --> 01:31:24,800
I think it works out perfectly

1706
01:31:25,568 --> 01:31:26,080
A hundred percent

1707
01:31:33,248 --> 01:31:35,040
Stupid Bank

1708
01:31:35,808 --> 01:31:41,696
Progressive

1709
01:31:46,048 --> 01:31:49,632
Interesting look

1710
01:31:50,144 --> 01:31:50,912
I'm not sure

1711
01:31:51,424 --> 01:31:52,704
How interested I am in Alex

1712
01:31:52,960 --> 01:31:57,056
Around this time frame based on

1713
01:31:57,312 --> 01:31:57,824
I like it

1714
01:31:58,080 --> 01:32:03,968
I'm a huge fan I don't know how much of it is actually attributable

1715
01:32:04,224 --> 01:32:06,528
Book to the fever I think he's in a holding pattern

1716
01:32:09,344 --> 01:32:11,136
I don't have a varsity narrative

1717
01:32:11,392 --> 01:32:16,256
And that's why I talk about hitting kids

1718
01:32:16,512 --> 01:32:22,144
2009 and 2015 investigation

1719
01:32:22,400 --> 01:32:25,472
Those are investigations we're trying to find something out
