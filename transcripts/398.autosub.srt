Air Jordan

2
00:00:21,504 --> 00:00:27,648
I have great respect for knowledge by knowledge I'm sick of them posing as if through the good guy

00:00:53,504 --> 00:00:59,136
Stripe.com

4
00:00:59,648 --> 00:01:04,256
Everybody around technology beverages

5
00:01:04,512 --> 00:01:10,144
Talk a little bit about what's going on with that weirdo Alex Jones

6
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,960
We are the weirdos talk about that weird

7
00:01:13,216 --> 00:01:16,032
Which one of us is weird

8
00:01:16,544 --> 00:01:17,824
I have a question

9
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:18,848
Sing for you though

10
00:01:19,104 --> 00:01:19,616
Lustration

11
00:01:20,128 --> 00:01:23,456
Can't get enough of you received a valentine as an adult

12
00:01:24,224 --> 00:01:26,528
Probably yeah but I mean

13
00:01:26,784 --> 00:01:28,320
I mean when did when do you become an adult

14
00:01:28,576 --> 00:01:30,880
What was the last time you got a valentine

15
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:32,928
I know it's been awhile

16
00:01:33,184 --> 00:01:34,720
Probably probably while

17
00:01:34,976 --> 00:01:36,256
In relationships

18
00:01:36,512 --> 00:01:37,792
The past there been like little vallon

19
00:01:38,048 --> 00:01:43,680
I consider when you say Valentine I really think of

20
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:45,728
It's like it has to be something that you're not

21
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:46,752
Seeing the person

22
00:01:47,264 --> 00:01:49,824
You know what I mean it has to be someone who you're not in a relationship

23
00:01:50,336 --> 00:01:51,360
Okay

24
00:01:51,616 --> 00:01:52,896
I feel like in school

25
00:01:53,152 --> 00:01:56,992
I'd always rather context of you being in a relationship it was just

26
00:01:57,248 --> 00:02:02,368
You give the whole class everybody everybody got a valentine yeah

27
00:02:02,624 --> 00:02:03,904
Burleigh's hopefully

28
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:05,184
High school and it evolves

29
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:10,816
Do like they're people you can buy roses from

30
00:02:16,704 --> 00:02:17,472
I don't know

31
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:19,520
Valentine giving his always

32
00:02:19,776 --> 00:02:22,336
Struck me as a little weird

33
00:02:23,616 --> 00:02:24,384
I put too much

34
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:25,920
Kintore interest

35
00:02:26,176 --> 00:02:26,944
Bedtime

36
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:30,528
I got a nice card from a girlfriend 10 years ago

37
00:02:32,576 --> 00:02:33,856
I've gotten an adult balance

38
00:02:34,368 --> 00:02:36,416
No no no never I mean a card

39
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:37,952
I've always thought of a valentine

40
00:02:38,464 --> 00:02:41,792
Right

41
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:42,816
Valentine

42
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:45,376
Bro you're really materialist

43
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:51,008
That's what I'm about money in the thing

44
00:02:51,264 --> 00:02:54,080
Every kiss begins with Hallmark is what I say

45
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:56,384
It seems like it's definitely something that is

46
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,664
More of

47
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,712
More less relevant

48
00:02:59,968 --> 00:03:00,480
Yeah

49
00:03:00,992 --> 00:03:03,296
It's a less relevant guy in adults

50
00:03:03,552 --> 00:03:08,416
Do not care

51
00:03:08,672 --> 00:03:10,208
And also I know a lot about Alex

52
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:12,000
And I don't know anything about either

53
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:14,816
Write Jordan so today we are still in the present

54
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:19,424
Because this s*** quiet while we're going over February

55
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:20,960
And a little bit of a temper

56
00:03:21,216 --> 00:03:21,984
20/20 of Dance

57
00:03:23,008 --> 00:03:25,056
Dammit and that's

58
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:28,640
The Sunday show and a little bit of Monday Monday is not very

59
00:03:28,896 --> 00:03:32,992
Sunday is fascinating

60
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:34,528
And I'm excited to get that

61
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:35,296
For you do

62
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:38,112
You take a little moment

63
00:03:38,368 --> 00:03:42,976
Love it

64
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:44,256

I don't do it

76
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:21,375
I was I was assuming you were going to go towards David eating and

77
00:04:21,631 --> 00:04:25,471
David Icke

78
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:29,055
Neckband thank you so much you're now about what you want

79
00:04:29,311 --> 00:04:29,823

82
00:04:39,295 --> 00:04:40,575
Technocrat

83
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:51,071
Money off that heroin

84
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:52,607
Are you pimp so good

85
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:54,911
Freakishly large

86
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:55,935
Claire

87
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:08,735
Absolutely

88
00:05:08,991 --> 00:05:13,599
Dot-com click the button that says Sports sure we would appreciate it very helpful thank you so much everybody

89
00:05:14,367 --> 00:05:20,511
Like a sporting show and just said this in a while but we are a little less than

90
00:05:20,767 --> 00:05:21,791
Two months behind

91
00:05:22,047 --> 00:05:27,423
Donation to shout out

92
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:28,191
Since there's just

93
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:31,775
Very little way we can figure out how to give people shoutouts

94
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:32,543
Without

95
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:38,175
Wheatley dragging the show to thank you so much

96
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:38,943
Thank you

97
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:39,967
Very very much

98
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:40,735
Nice to everyone

99
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:45,343
I also think I got to thank you to listen to her who reached out to me

100
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:48,671
Maybe because they gave me a little bit of a correction

101
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:53,791
Hourly pointed something out that I got wrong and I need to make a little correction about our last episode

102
00:05:54,047 --> 00:05:58,399
So on our last episode I responded to Mike Adams citing a stat

103
00:05:58,655 --> 00:05:59,679
From Neil Ferguson

104
00:05:59,935 --> 00:06:01,215
About the Coronavirus

105
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:02,751
Break and I made an incorrect

106
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:10,175
Because there's someone named Neil Ferguson who's come on Alex's show a bit in the past and he's from the UK

107
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:12,991
Recently written an op-ed about the Coronavirus

108
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:14,015
I assumed

109
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:16,319
That was the Neil Ferguson that Mike was referring to

110
00:06:17,087 --> 00:06:22,463
As this listener ironically named Alex pointed out there is another Neil Ferguson

111
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:24,255
Who is an actual Public Health

112
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:26,303
Expert from Imperial College London

113
00:06:26,559 --> 00:06:28,095
I apologize that I got that wrong

114
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:29,887
So because I dismissed

115
00:06:30,143 --> 00:06:33,471
The claims that were made based on believing them to come from a humanities

116
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:37,567
Professor it's only right that I take a look at them now given that they're supposedly coming

117
00:06:37,823 --> 00:06:38,591
From someone whose opinion

118
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:40,639
Is a little more valid on the subject

119
00:06:41,663 --> 00:06:44,991
A couple of important qualifications here are that Ferguson's number is

120
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:49,855
And in the interview where he expresses this estimate he also says that they don't know enough

121
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:50,879
T-shirt

122
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:54,207
Even if there are as many cases as he is estimating

123
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:55,999
He's also very specifically talk

124
00:06:56,255 --> 00:06:58,815
Talking about people who come down with very mild forms

125
00:06:59,071 --> 00:06:59,583
Do the virus

126
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:02,655
Who may not even know they have it and may not even be contagious

127
00:07:03,679 --> 00:07:07,775
In the interview Ferguson doesn't get into the modeling too much explain how his essay

128
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:08,799
Has reached

129
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:09,823
Also notably

130
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:11,103
He's not freaked out about

131
00:07:11,359 --> 00:07:12,895
And it's almost a side thought in

132
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:13,663
In the conversation

133
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:14,431
It's not even

134
00:07:14,687 --> 00:07:18,783
Something that's nailed onto much but it's the piece of the conversation that is

135
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:20,575
Taken an amplified

136
00:07:20,831 --> 00:07:21,343
All over the

137
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:22,111
Play yeah

138
00:07:22,367 --> 00:07:25,183
Even if what Ferguson is estimating is accurate

139
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:25,951
Which he's not even

140
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:26,719
Concretely

141
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:27,487
He's saying

142
00:07:27,743 --> 00:07:30,047
It doesn't justify the way Mike Adams was using

143
00:07:30,303 --> 00:07:30,815
That figure

144
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:34,655
Mike took that 50000

145
00:07:34,911 --> 00:07:38,751
The new infections number that Ferguson was estimating

146
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:40,543
And he connected it with the fifth

147
00:07:41,055 --> 00:07:42,847
Percent mortality rate from the Lance

148
00:07:43,103 --> 00:07:43,615
Set study

149
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:47,199
To say that China would be looking at 7,500 deaths a day

150
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:49,247
The cases that were part of Fergus

151
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:52,831
Zestimate were largely very mild cases and not the ones that would lead to

152
00:07:53,087 --> 00:07:56,415
Two deaths where is the Lancet study was a breakdown of 41-page

153
00:07:56,671 --> 00:07:57,183
Presented

154
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:58,719
Already having pneumonia

155
00:07:59,231 --> 00:07:59,999
So those are

156
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:02,559
Inappropriate use of these two

157
00:08:03,839 --> 00:08:04,863
In another article

158
00:08:05,119 --> 00:08:06,399
Open February 10th in the telegram

159
00:08:06,911 --> 00:08:07,679
Ferguson said

160
00:08:07,935 --> 00:08:08,959
Quote or estimate

161
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:12,799
Well subject too much uncertainty due to the limited data currently available

162
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:17,663
Suggest that the impact of the unfolding epidemic maybe comprable to D major influenza pay

163
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:19,455
Pandemics of the 20th century

164
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:20,479
Is this a swine

165
00:08:23,807 --> 00:08:25,855
To say that it is a serious public health issue

166
00:08:26,111 --> 00:08:26,879
Issue but it's not enough

167
00:08:27,391 --> 00:08:28,927
Ellipticals at the way Mike Adams at

168
00:08:29,183 --> 00:08:29,695
I'm trying to use

169
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:31,487
Ferguson's estimates Disturbed

170
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:34,815
Anyway I apologize for mixing up in Healdsburg

171
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:38,655
I made a little bit of a hasty assumption based on a familiar name popping up

172
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:40,447
I'll be sure to be more careful about that

173
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:41,215
The future

174
00:08:41,727 --> 00:08:47,871
Point Still Remains unfair one of those Neal Ferguson's needs to release

175
00:08:48,127 --> 00:08:48,639
Vanquish their bread

176
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:49,407
Citizenship

177
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:54,527
Otherwise we will be confused forever name and I would say that

178
00:08:54,783 --> 00:08:57,087
Brother been on Infowars

179
00:08:57,599 --> 00:09:00,159
Anyway I just wanted to get that out of the way up top because

180
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:03,487
Perfect bungled a little something.

181
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:05,535
And also thank you to listen or Alex

182
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:06,559
Disappointed that I really want

183
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:07,583
Appreciate

184
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:09,887
So we start here on February 9th

185
00:09:10,143 --> 00:09:10,655
And

186
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:12,191
I should say that

187
00:09:13,215 --> 00:09:14,239
Prior to this

188
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:15,007
Clip

189
00:09:16,287 --> 00:09:17,311
The show started

190
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:19,359
And it started with

191
00:09:19,615 --> 00:09:20,127
311

192
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:21,919
The band 311

193
00:09:28,831 --> 00:09:31,903
Alex, please don't like them

194
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:33,183
Reggae dancehall.

195
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:41,119
Much like I did on the last episode 11

196
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:43,679
Play some 311 music and Alex

197
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:46,239
Is having a tough time okay

198
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:50,335
Well well well ladies and gentlemen on Alex Jones your host

199
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:52,639
To be reduced to clarify even further

200
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:54,431
The 311 plays

201
00:09:54,687 --> 00:09:55,711
Then there's silence

202
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:58,783
And then we get this Star Wars music

203
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:01,855
Garden Show at the beginning of the next

204
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:04,159
Everything we do here

205
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:06,463
Not starting the show

206
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:11,071
And that's just the way it is

207
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:14,655
H-E-B over the years

208
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:16,191
Broadcast

209
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:17,983
Art with music accounts line

210
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:18,751
Worse

211
00:10:19,263 --> 00:10:20,543
Bringing pina coladas

212
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:23,103
Just woke up the Garden of Eden before the start

213
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:25,151
We'll just makes me

214
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:27,967
That's what the real

215
00:10:29,247 --> 00:10:29,759
Future

216
00:10:30,271 --> 00:10:30,783
Acumen

217
00:10:31,295 --> 00:10:32,575
Civilization

218
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:35,903
311 is it

219
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:42,815
Okay that's where we are right now alright

220
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:45,119
When I was a little younger but

221
00:10:45,631 --> 00:10:47,423
I don't this is Nova react

222
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:53,823
I do hate 311 specifically you heard me I was singing along with Fascination Street before

223
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:55,871
We started the show

224
00:10:56,127 --> 00:10:57,919
311

225
00:10:58,175 --> 00:10:59,455
Cover of Love song I Will Never

226
00:10:59,711 --> 00:11:00,223
Forgive them for

227
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:02,783
So Amber Amber is the color of your energy

228
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:04,319
Perrigo 800

229
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:05,087
Hater

230
00:11:05,343 --> 00:11:06,111
Hate 311

231
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:06,879
Yep

232
00:11:07,903 --> 00:11:11,487
Dna2 work beautiful disaster

233
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:15,327
I don't even like that you know three of

234
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:17,375
Hi

235
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:19,679
For a while speculators younger

236
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:20,447
Love it

237
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:24,031
I don't know if I ever I think those timelines are off

238
00:11:24,543 --> 00:11:27,615
I don't think those timelines are accurate though cuz I think I

239
00:11:27,871 --> 00:11:30,175
Might have like 311 road before

240
00:11:30,431 --> 00:11:34,271
I was old enough that I was smoking weed

241
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:37,599
The podcast where we get to the bottom

242
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:38,879
311

243
00:11:39,135 --> 00:11:40,159
Throws Alex off

244
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:43,999
Except where he has to restart the show over again which is

245
00:11:44,255 --> 00:11:44,767
Awesome

246
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:48,351
Anyway Alex gets into talking about

247
00:11:48,607 --> 00:11:50,655
You know his main story 04

248
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:51,935
The Coronavirus

249
00:11:52,447 --> 00:11:52,959
Natural law

250
00:11:53,215 --> 00:11:55,775
Easy getting into it a little bit but

251
00:11:56,031 --> 00:11:56,543
Thankfully

252
00:11:57,311 --> 00:11:59,103
Please not the main focus

253
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:00,127
It's of a ton of vascepa

254
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:02,687
That's good we will get other topics

255
00:12:02,943 --> 00:12:04,735
To discuss sold out of

256
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:09,599
You know you got to kind of think of that might be

257
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:12,927
It's nice to have some other topics to talk about but of course

258
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:16,255
He has to keep that ball in the air yes to keep juggling it

259
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:17,535
So you touches on it a little bit

260
00:12:18,303 --> 00:12:21,887
I'm obsessed with the coronavirus because it is man-made

261
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:24,703
And they're acting really sneaky about it

262
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:27,775
They're not just doing this martial law thing

263
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:30,335
Precedent nnn get and get

264
00:12:30,591 --> 00:12:31,103
I scared

265
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:34,175
Oh don't be scared but we've got martial law in place

266
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:38,271
And the unit prison she's paying for killing people in the street to check

267
00:12:38,527 --> 00:12:39,039
Wind

268
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:40,319
So

269
00:12:40,831 --> 00:12:42,111
Double quick points on

270
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:43,391
Beside life

271
00:12:44,415 --> 00:12:44,927
Alex is obsessed with

272
00:12:45,183 --> 00:12:47,487
The virus because he's seeing a drastic increase in his sales

273
00:12:47,999 --> 00:12:51,071
He's already said that his immune gargle sold out and if you go to my

274
00:12:51,327 --> 00:12:56,191
My Patriot Supply website they're saying they'll eat 12 times in Greece order volume

275
00:12:56,447 --> 00:12:58,495
Now naturally not all those sales are coming

276
00:12:58,751 --> 00:13:03,359
Alex since they also sponsor pretty much all of the big right-wing alarm

277
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:06,175
It's clear that Alex's share the sales are rising

278
00:13:07,199 --> 00:13:10,015
To any government that decides to enact martial law

279
00:13:10,271 --> 00:13:10,783
Probably does

280
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:12,063
Don't care too much about their being

281
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:13,855
Your president that's kind of silly

282
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:18,207
Also this fails to take into account the quarantine cities already has a long

283
00:13:19,231 --> 00:13:24,863
In 2014 the city of human in China was put into lockdown after a man there died of the bubonic

284
00:13:25,119 --> 00:13:25,631
McPlay

285
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:28,447
During the SARS outbreak in 2003 while they did

286
00:13:28,703 --> 00:13:29,727
Quarantine a whole city

287
00:13:29,983 --> 00:13:35,871
Canada quarantine over 30,000 people in Toronto even though they only had 250 probable cases

288
00:13:36,383 --> 00:13:36,895
Of the virus

289
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:38,687
The experts don't believe that

290
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:43,039
Strictly enforced large-scale currencies are the best way to deal with outbreaks but also they really

291
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:44,575
Stop a country from doing

292
00:13:45,343 --> 00:13:47,903
If there were some International ban encore

293
00:13:48,415 --> 00:13:48,927
Leaving Alex

294
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:50,207
Who claimed that it was a globalist

295
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:52,767
Infringing on a country Sovereign right to lock down a city

296
00:13:53,023 --> 00:13:55,071
If they wanted to so it really is all just not

297
00:13:55,327 --> 00:13:58,143
Can you imagine if governments listen to

298
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:01,983
Experts that would be hilarious being insane world we live

299
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:05,055
International Health regulations

300
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:06,079
The countries is

301
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:06,847
Agreed to

302
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:08,127
But the issue is

303
00:14:08,383 --> 00:14:09,663
That they are not enforceable

304
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:11,455
So the first thing

305
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:13,503
About that

306
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:15,295
There's no evidence

307
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:17,343
You can find that the video involving

308
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:19,135
The electric woman who'd been shot

309
00:14:19,391 --> 00:14:19,903
Idetect

310
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:21,183
Point has been verified

311
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:24,511
This is just something that Alex saw that someone had tweeted

312
00:14:24,767 --> 00:14:26,559
I have no idea if it's a real or current

313
00:14:26,815 --> 00:14:29,375
I don't know what the truth is there and neither does Alex

314
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:32,703
He's assuming that it's real without any confirmation or journalist

315
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:33,471
Due diligence

316
00:14:34,239 --> 00:14:35,007
And to the larger point

317
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:38,079
People are not applauding China for Institute of the Courant

318
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:40,127
19 Aldi's brutal Crackdown.

319
00:14:40,383 --> 00:14:42,943
Actually what they're doing is likely a part of a

320
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:44,223
Complicated balancing

321
00:14:45,503 --> 00:14:48,319
Because those International Health regulations are not enforced

322
00:14:48,831 --> 00:14:49,855
They're completely up to

323
00:14:50,111 --> 00:14:51,903
To each country to abide by them willingly

324
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:53,695
If a country doesn't cooperate

325
00:14:53,951 --> 00:14:55,231
The crisis that crisis is going to

326
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:56,511
Be impossible to deal with

327
00:14:56,767 --> 00:14:57,279
And that effect

328
00:14:57,535 --> 00:14:58,047
The whole world

329
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:01,631
So well there is growing evidence of a lack of trying

330
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:02,655
A & C on China

331
00:15:02,911 --> 00:15:03,679
Is part potentially

332
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:05,471
And of course there are

333
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:09,311
Any questions about whether or not the quarantining of millions of people is a great idea

334
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:11,103
The praise that people like

335
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:13,663
Like the head of the World Health Organization or expressing

336
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:15,199
Are not about those issue

337
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:18,015
We're in a public health emergency

338
00:15:19,039 --> 00:15:20,319
Coronavirus

339
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:21,343
Broadly speaking

340
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:24,415
And successful navigation of that emergency

341
00:15:24,927 --> 00:15:26,719
Depends on China's cooperation

342
00:15:27,487 --> 00:15:32,607
Fox interview couple experts about this I think that their perspective is helpful in understanding some of these public state

343
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:33,887
Flipping bacon

344
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:35,679
41 is very

345
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,983
The China identified and sent out the

346
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:39,263
The Genome of this virus

347
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:40,287
Prompt fashion

348
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:42,591
So that is something that is worthy of praise

349
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:43,615
When did you know you can

350
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:44,383
You can hang your hat on

351
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:45,151
That's

352
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:47,199
That's fine Alex said they did

353
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:48,223
Sure

354
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:50,015
But the issue comes down to

355
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:51,039
Pharmacy

356
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:52,831
Debbie sridhar

357
00:15:53,087 --> 00:15:54,111
Karthi charity global

358
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:55,135
Public Health

359

University of Edinburgh

360
00:15:58,975 --> 00:15:59,487
Box quote

361
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:01,791
The World Health Organization is a difficult balancing

362
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:07,679
They have to somehow retained being believe coordinator and director of international Health work and the trade-offs

363
00:16:07,935 --> 00:16:08,959
They're having

364
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:11,519
To make our about the greater good

365
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:13,311
Right now the greater good is to

366
00:16:13,567 --> 00:16:14,847
To create positive incentives

367
00:16:15,103 --> 00:16:15,871
Ford Country

368
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:17,663
To collaborate with the World Health

369
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:19,199
Relation to share data

370
00:16:19,455 --> 00:16:20,735
To let missions into China

371
00:16:20,991 --> 00:16:21,759
If that means

372
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:23,551
Publicly having to praise China

373
00:16:23,807 --> 00:16:24,575
I understand

374
00:16:25,599 --> 00:16:26,623
Lawrence Gaston

375
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:29,439
A global health law professor at Georgetown said quote

376
00:16:29,695 --> 00:16:31,487
If the World Health Organization criticizes

377
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:32,255
Is China public

378
00:16:33,023 --> 00:16:34,303
It's possible they can be less

379
00:16:34,815 --> 00:16:36,095
A parent less cooperative

380
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:38,143
If I was in Ted roast

381
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:40,191
Head of the World Health Organization

382
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:41,471
Exposing his shoes

383
00:16:41,727 --> 00:16:43,263
I'm not entirely sure I would do any

384
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:46,847
This is a really complicated the kind of thing

385
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:48,127
The reality is

386
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:52,991
These International Health regulations are great and people agree to them after outbreaks are resolved

387
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:57,343
And then there pretty quickly ignored whenever a new one pops up in that surprising

388
00:16:57,599 --> 00:17:00,671
For instance restricting entry of people from affected areas

389
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:01,951
Counter to those regulations

390
00:17:02,207 --> 00:17:05,535
But every time there's a public health event countries are quick to breed

391
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:06,303
This Norm

392
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:07,839
Mark Eccleston

393
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:08,863
Turner a global

394
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:11,935
Health law professor 8q university in England told V

395
00:17:12,447 --> 00:17:14,239
Quote the international Health regulations

396
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:16,031
Operates on Mutual Trust

397
00:17:16,287 --> 00:17:16,799
Largely

398
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:19,359
And I it is Eddie's a mutual Trust

399
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:22,175
That Mutual trust has been eroded

400
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:25,503
Over a number of outbreaks remember states have ignored the recommendation

401
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:26,527
From the World Health

402
00:17:26,783 --> 00:17:27,295
Organization

403
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:31,135
I think it's possible that we have at times painted too Rosy a picture

404
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:34,719
Picture of the coronavirus situation but that's just because I'm responding to the

405
00:17:34,975 --> 00:17:35,743
The claims the Alex

406
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:37,791
Witcher sensationalist trash

407
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:39,583
When you're dealing with

408
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:41,631
A guy who sang

409
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:42,911
You're garbage like it

410
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:44,191
It's over for Humanity

411
00:17:44,447 --> 00:17:46,239
It will only be lone survivors

412
00:17:46,495 --> 00:17:48,799
And you pair that with embarrassing sales to

413
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:51,103
Tactics I have no qualms about saying that it's the

414
00:17:51,359 --> 00:17:52,127
Just trash and garbage

415
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:55,455
That's said it's important to recognize that serious people do have

416
00:17:55,711 --> 00:17:57,759
Critiques about China's handling of the outbreak

417
00:17:58,015 --> 00:17:59,295
They just don't match up with what Alex

418
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:02,879
And so when you hear people like the heads of the World Health

419
00:18:03,135 --> 00:18:06,207
Organization saying that we applaud China until there is

420
00:18:06,463 --> 00:18:07,743
A dynamic up there are things

421
00:18:07,999 --> 00:18:09,535
And it's not wrong to

422
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:10,815
To point those things out

423
00:18:11,071 --> 00:18:13,119
And if you don't do that

424
00:18:13,631 --> 00:18:16,959
You have a state that has the ability to stop cooperating

425
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:19,775
And you run the risk of making everything worse for the world

426
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:22,079
All of these issues are best to be dealt with

427
00:18:22,591 --> 00:18:23,103
After

428
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:25,919
The immediacy of yeah

429
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:26,943
It's okay

430
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:33,343
How do you how do you get any strongman powerful dictator on your

431
00:18:33,599 --> 00:18:35,135
Beside you flatter the s*** out

432
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:37,695
We see what Stevie pisan Alex

433
00:18:37,951 --> 00:18:38,719
All the time

434
00:18:38,975 --> 00:18:40,255
So the World Health Organization

435
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:41,535
I'm going to China and being like

436
00:18:41,791 --> 00:18:45,631
You guys are doing great everything that you guys been kicking ass we love it

437
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:48,959
Help us help you that whole thing is going to be far more if

438
00:18:49,471 --> 00:18:49,983
Save the being like

439
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:51,775
Here's what you're doing wrong

440
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:53,567
Stop stop change it to this

441
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:56,639
Do I wish that wasn't the case

442
00:18:56,895 --> 00:18:57,407
Of course

443
00:18:57,663 --> 00:18:58,687
But it's

444
00:18:58,943 --> 00:18:59,711
Unfortunately

445
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:02,271
The people who understand the situation in the expert

446
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:04,063
Are pretty clear on that

447
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:05,087
Which again

448
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:06,879
No government pays any attention

449
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:08,927
Attention to anybody who knows what's going on

450
00:19:10,719 --> 00:19:12,511
The Optics of this are perfect

451
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:14,047
Because Alex can say that

452
00:19:14,303 --> 00:19:20,447
Be in a World Health Organization in these leaders are applauding China and pretend that what they're applauding

453
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:23,263
Thing is all of the meme videos that you seeing

454
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:26,591
And all of the harsh Crackdown of the quarantine

455
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:27,871
And that's just not fair

456
00:19:28,127 --> 00:19:30,175
Alex is playing with Optics in a way that

457
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:31,199
I mean

458
00:19:31,455 --> 00:19:31,967
Deceitful

459
00:19:32,991 --> 00:19:34,271
So Alex

460
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:36,319
He's really

461
00:19:37,087 --> 00:19:38,623
I don't know

462
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:39,903
How to say like you really hate

463
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:40,671
311

464
00:19:40,927 --> 00:19:42,207
Hey I've been trying

465
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:44,511
To plunge

466
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:45,279
Stock market

467
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:47,071
Using listen

468
00:19:47,327 --> 00:19:48,607
Information

469
00:19:50,143 --> 00:19:50,911
But they're going to try

470
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:52,191
Very

471
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:52,959
Very

472
00:19:53,215 --> 00:19:54,239
Hard this week

473
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:57,823
We're going to be

474
00:19:58,079 --> 00:19:59,359
Going over all of it

475
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:01,151
Monopoly star

476
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:02,943
The broadcast

477
00:20:09,855 --> 00:20:10,367
Bible ship

478
00:20:11,135 --> 00:20:11,647
Weather

479
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:13,183
Thermometer

480
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:15,231
I don't know got it

481
00:20:16,255 --> 00:20:17,279
Frigerators what are we doing

482
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:20,095
Your honor

483
00:20:20,607 --> 00:20:22,143
Your honor

484
00:20:22,655 --> 00:20:23,423
Giant

485
00:20:23,935 --> 00:20:26,751
Information ready to launch record trigger

486
00:20:27,263 --> 00:20:29,055
And I got it on the runway

487
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:30,591
Right there

488
00:20:31,615 --> 00:20:33,151
That's why we're going to come back

489
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:35,199
Push ups

490
00:20:35,711 --> 00:20:36,223
For a moment

491
00:20:37,247 --> 00:20:38,783
Trioxin 9

492
00:20:40,575 --> 00:20:42,367
Start the rodcast over

493
00:20:43,391 --> 00:20:44,927
And it's all going to be

494
00:20:45,439 --> 00:20:46,207
Peachy

495
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:50,815
After that point and I'm going to knock it out of the park

496
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:54,911
All your support I don't know

497
00:20:56,703 --> 00:21:01,311
It's like you got Labrador Retrievers

498
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:03,615
Puppies

499
00:21:04,127 --> 00:21:04,639
Come out here

500
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:06,431
Music what state

501
00:21:15,135 --> 00:21:20,000
Alex wasted like 6 minutes on there cuz it's three lifetime you know what

502
00:21:20,256 --> 00:21:24,608
Now I will finally be able to answer when people that like would you want to talk to Alex Jones lb like

503
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:25,888
Yes at a bar

504
00:21:26,144 --> 00:21:29,216
And only about 3:11 and I would bring the peanut

505
00:21:29,472 --> 00:21:31,008
Exactly

506
00:21:32,032 --> 00:21:35,360
Man he's really affected by 311

507
00:21:35,616 --> 00:21:41,760
It's tragic to because I would associate people who like 311 with being like susceptible to Infowars propaganda

508
00:21:43,296 --> 00:21:47,648
I don't know if that's the case maybe I'm making way too broad of generalization

509
00:21:47,904 --> 00:21:48,416
But

510
00:21:48,672 --> 00:21:51,232
I would say their subjects

511
00:21:51,488 --> 00:21:52,256
2 dugg

512
00:21:52,768 --> 00:21:54,304
Formic acid

513
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:56,096
Yeah so Alex

514
00:21:56,352 --> 00:21:57,120
Gets back from break and

515
00:21:57,376 --> 00:21:58,656
He starts the real show

516
00:21:59,168 --> 00:22:02,240
And on this the beginning of the real show he's talking

517
00:22:02,496 --> 00:22:04,288
He's talking about some issues

518
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,592
And one of them turns out is Rush Limbaugh

519
00:22:06,848 --> 00:22:10,688
Who has come down with some cancer and got a medal of freedom

520
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,480
Great Alex

521
00:22:12,736 --> 00:22:14,272
Why is America

522
00:22:14,528 --> 00:22:16,576
Very weird feelings about this

523
00:22:16,832 --> 00:22:18,112
I think he's trying to

524
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:20,160
Express a certain amount of like

525
00:22:20,928 --> 00:22:25,536
You know we feel bad for him sure at the same time he also seems to think like

526
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:26,560
Once he dies

527
00:22:26,816 --> 00:22:32,960
I'm going to get here where's Aldi

528
00:22:33,216 --> 00:22:36,288
Open phones s h the Sunday show

529
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:41,152
I'm going to go home and see my children

530
00:22:42,688 --> 00:22:45,760
I'm going to come back tomorrow to the 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. broadcast

531
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:48,064
The three 11 a.m.

532
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:50,112
Rush Limbaugh with his lung cancer

533
00:22:54,464 --> 00:22:55,232
4

534
00:22:56,512 --> 00:22:58,816
You're going to be the next project Limbaugh they say

535
00:22:59,584 --> 00:23:02,144
I'm like well actually I'm more

536
00:23:02,912 --> 00:23:05,216
Soundtrack the radio you can say is oblock bigger

537
00:23:05,728 --> 00:23:06,240
You could

538
00:23:07,008 --> 00:23:08,800
Fancy myself as an Xbox one ball

539
00:23:09,056 --> 00:23:10,848
Rush Limbaugh's become what

540
00:23:11,104 --> 00:23:15,200
Talk about...

541
00:23:18,784 --> 00:23:19,808
We will probably go out

542
00:23:20,064 --> 00:23:22,112
Patience when Rush Limbaugh

543
00:23:23,648 --> 00:23:26,208
I do not have a good feeling about that

544
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:28,768
He might be able to stop

545
00:23:29,024 --> 00:23:30,304
While we hope he has America

546
00:23:32,096 --> 00:23:33,632
Like the omen of Rush Limbaugh

547
00:23:33,888 --> 00:23:39,520
Dying right before the 2020 election because he definitely helped Trump get elected the big way

548
00:23:39,776 --> 00:23:45,920
So Alex is looking at this like a human.

549
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:51,040
Covers when he dies I'm going to get all of a s*** so we really I'm not saying I don't want him to recover

550
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:58,208
Sucks that Russia's dying before the election cuz we could have used everybody

551
00:23:58,464 --> 00:23:59,488
How it works

552
00:23:59,744 --> 00:24:02,048
He's also not a lot of other people in line

553
00:24:02,304 --> 00:24:06,656
For that time slot there are a hundred other like big

554
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,960
People who syndicated

555
00:24:09,216 --> 00:24:12,800
Those time slots on all those stationed there we would never work with Alex

556
00:24:13,312 --> 00:24:17,664
So they were people like Mark Levin or Hugh Hewitt or

557
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:18,944
Goguen backer

558
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:19,968
Call Sean Hannity.

559
00:24:20,224 --> 00:24:20,736
Lakeview

560
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:25,600
Plenty of people within that time slot that would Rush Limbaugh goes away

561
00:24:25,856 --> 00:24:27,392
Hannity takes over his times.

562
00:24:27,904 --> 00:24:29,184
Bandages all over the

563
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:34,304
Whatever whatever the case is Alex's not next in line

564
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:38,144
There is no line that Alex is even in let alone next

565
00:24:38,656 --> 00:24:39,168
I don't

566
00:24:39,424 --> 00:24:43,008
Think that there is a massive radio stations that are like

567
00:24:43,264 --> 00:24:43,776
F***

568
00:24:44,032 --> 00:24:45,056
We want to play Alex

569
00:24:45,312 --> 00:24:51,456
But the time slot use against Rock

570
00:24:51,712 --> 00:24:54,528
I think there's three Stations of the country that might have that deliver

571
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:58,624
Isotonix is real

572
00:24:58,880 --> 00:24:59,648
In all this

573
00:24:59,904 --> 00:25:00,416
But I'm not

574
00:25:00,672 --> 00:25:01,440
Interested in

575
00:25:01,696 --> 00:25:02,720
Celebrating him having

576
00:25:02,976 --> 00:25:04,000
Cancer in anyway

577
00:25:04,512 --> 00:25:06,048
I hate him

578
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:07,072
And I think that this is

579
00:25:07,328 --> 00:25:09,120
Disgraceful

580
00:25:09,632 --> 00:25:12,448
So I asked some other dudes about the

581
00:25:12,704 --> 00:25:15,008
The Coronavirus

582
00:25:15,264 --> 00:25:16,032
United States

583
00:25:16,288 --> 00:25:17,056
And it's a lotus

584
00:25:17,568 --> 00:25:18,336
Let me just

585
00:25:18,848 --> 00:25:21,152
Tell you what I'm going to get today

586
00:25:22,944 --> 00:25:24,992
First up we have the

587
00:25:25,248 --> 00:25:28,320
Set up at US military base

588
00:25:30,112 --> 00:25:31,392
That's Miami Herald we broke this

589
00:25:31,648 --> 00:25:32,672
Almost 2 weeks ago

590
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,232
And I thought they were establishing these

591
00:25:41,376 --> 00:25:42,912
From Whitehouse horses

592
00:25:43,424 --> 00:25:44,192
In the interest of

593
00:25:44,448 --> 00:25:46,496
The clearness I've heard Alex saying that the governor

594
00:25:46,752 --> 00:25:50,592
Specifically preparing for a gigantic quarantine near Seattle

595
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:53,920
That's specific I've heard of using the past

596
00:25:54,432 --> 00:25:55,200
As far as I know

597
00:25:55,968 --> 00:25:58,272
The rest of the things I've heard from him have been vague and not

598
00:25:58,528 --> 00:25:59,296
Specific fears back

599
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:00,320
Some s*** that's

600
00:26:00,576 --> 00:26:02,112
I didn't terms of what he

601
00:26:02,368 --> 00:26:03,392
You put out on the Shelf

602
00:26:03,648 --> 00:26:04,928
Then like the Seattle

603
00:26:05,696 --> 00:26:10,560
So this Miami Herald article is just about the Department of Defense entering into an agreement at the request

604
00:26:10,816 --> 00:26:12,608
The Department of Health and Human Services

605
00:26:12,864 --> 00:26:13,632
To provide quarantine

606
00:26:13,888 --> 00:26:15,424
Teen space in case they're need

607
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:16,960
For additional beds for

608
00:26:17,216 --> 00:26:18,240
For suspected Coronavirus

609
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:20,544
What this comes down to

610
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,080
Is the fact that the bases are

611
00:26:22,336 --> 00:26:22,848
To handle this

612
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:26,176
And they're located in places where they can be helpful

613
00:26:26,944 --> 00:26:30,528
The basis that agreed to assist our specifically ones that are near major

614
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,832
So flights entering the United States

615
00:26:33,088 --> 00:26:34,624
Some areas affected by the outbreak disc

616
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:35,392
Disembark

617
00:26:35,648 --> 00:26:38,464
They have screening measures down to the passengers and then suspect the cases

618
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:39,744
Could be taken to the centers at the

619
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:40,512
Video device

620
00:26:41,536 --> 00:26:44,608
The article is very clear that this is still the Department of Health and Human

621
00:26:44,864 --> 00:26:45,888
Services operation

622
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:50,240
Just using space at these bases instead of creating new facilities or they don't

623
00:26:50,752 --> 00:26:51,264
Create

624
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,056
With the Pentagon spokesman

625
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:53,824
Insane quotes

626
00:26:54,080 --> 00:27:00,224
DOD Personnel will not be in direct contact with the evacuees and will minimize contact with Personnel supporting.

627
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:00,992
Evacuees

628
00:27:01,504 --> 00:27:05,856
So how it works is it the medical staff will attend to them and if anyone test positive

629
00:27:06,112 --> 00:27:09,184
4 coronavirus bill then be relocated to a nearby IHOP

630
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,256
This is also a very limited range

631
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,560
The help agreement only last

632
00:27:14,816 --> 00:27:16,096
Until February twenty

633
00:27:16,864 --> 00:27:20,448
The likely reason for this Arrangement being struck is because earlier this month

634
00:27:20,704 --> 00:27:22,496
Trump sign an executive order that restricted

635
00:27:22,752 --> 00:27:23,776
Travel from China

636
00:27:24,032 --> 00:27:24,544
But it didn't come

637
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:25,824
Completely shut it down

638
00:27:26,592 --> 00:27:28,384
According to the Charlotte Observer starting

639
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:29,408
February 2nd

640
00:27:29,664 --> 00:27:32,224
Flights from China to the United States were being directed to

641
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:35,040
This Pacific airports where the passengers could be best screen

642
00:27:35,808 --> 00:27:37,600
It makes sense that the Department of Health and you

643
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:40,416
Human Services would make use of the resources available to them

644
00:27:40,672 --> 00:27:42,208
And if possible borrow space from

645
00:27:42,464 --> 00:27:44,256
The dod to house any possible suspect

646
00:27:44,768 --> 00:27:45,280
To the my popup

647
00:27:45,792 --> 00:27:46,304
McDonald's

648
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:51,936
It's very frustrating to me that all of this sounds incredibly reasonable and let her know Alex

649
00:27:52,448 --> 00:27:52,960
Attacking

650
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:59,616
Because it has the optic that he needs in order to create the fears that he's already built up over the years of Seminary

651
00:28:00,128 --> 00:28:01,920
And the only thing you can assume is he would

652
00:28:02,176 --> 00:28:04,992
Preferred large matte scale panic and Chaos 2

653
00:28:05,248 --> 00:28:10,624
Resupply actual rioting

654
00:28:11,136 --> 00:28:11,648
Rocky wants to

655
00:28:11,904 --> 00:28:13,440
Controlled Chaos that's enough

656
00:28:13,696 --> 00:28:14,464
You're scared enough

657
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:15,488
To buy his product

658
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,536
But you're not scared enough to get out of

659
00:28:18,816 --> 00:28:20,608
Sweet spot that he wants people at

660
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,656
Also it's not like these.

661
00:28:22,912 --> 00:28:23,936
These hunters will be gigantic

662
00:28:24,192 --> 00:28:24,704
Prisons or something

663
00:28:25,472 --> 00:28:28,800
According to the very Miami Herald article that Alex's sighting

664
00:28:29,056 --> 00:28:29,824
Each would be able

665
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:31,872
Housing maximum of twenty patients

666
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:33,920
Just seems like good precaution

667
00:28:34,176 --> 00:28:36,992
Being taken as far as I can tell

668
00:28:37,504 --> 00:28:42,368
Nothing in the article talks about how many people are even being taken to those places

669
00:28:42,624 --> 00:28:43,904
If anyone is

670
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,696
Yeah there's no

671
00:28:45,952 --> 00:28:46,464
And it's

672
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,256
It's not like they would be the first

673
00:28:48,512 --> 00:28:51,584
Places we were taking cuz the DHHS already has

674
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:52,864
Places to take the

675
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:55,936
People in case there are tons

676
00:28:56,192 --> 00:28:56,704
More

677
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,752
People who are coming in from China worth

678
00:28:59,008 --> 00:28:59,776
Suspected

679
00:29:00,032 --> 00:29:01,568
I haven't there the virus

680
00:29:02,336 --> 00:29:08,480
Well maybe they have today maybe they have to switch around and all the soldiers have to go to the Department of Human Health Services in all of

681
00:29:11,552 --> 00:29:15,136
We have a nice little switch-a-roo everybody learns about each other

682
00:29:15,392 --> 00:29:17,696
Is the 13 Going on 30 scenario dance

683
00:29:17,952 --> 00:29:19,488
And again

684
00:29:19,744 --> 00:29:21,280
Bring sharp Focus to this

685
00:29:21,536 --> 00:29:22,048
You know like

686
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:23,584
Did the idea that I like

687
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:29,984
In his narratives are designed to get you no matter what you do if they didn't do something like this as a precaution or

688
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:36,384
You'll have these plans at the whaler sleep at the wheel they're letting us all die they don't give a s*** about us

689
00:29:37,408 --> 00:29:38,944
So

690
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:48,416
I've never seen something so sexy

691
00:29:49,184 --> 00:29:50,208
Spell weirdo

692
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,000
So we can

693
00:29:52,256 --> 00:29:54,560
Off the coronavirus top and that's great

694
00:30:00,192 --> 00:30:01,728
Juicy and

695
00:30:01,984 --> 00:30:03,008
But it's not good

696
00:30:03,776 --> 00:30:09,920
It's nice breath of fresh air from a dumpster

697
00:30:10,176 --> 00:30:15,040
But it's also a dumpster

698
00:30:15,296 --> 00:30:16,064
Burger King that's nice

699
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:18,112
Right so Chris Matthews

700
00:30:18,368 --> 00:30:24,000
After the New Hampshire Democratic primary make some comment about how if

701
00:30:24,512 --> 00:30:27,584
Bernie gets any might kill his rivals or whatever

702
00:30:28,096 --> 00:30:32,192
Chris Matthews lost his mind to it was a little bit I was going to

703
00:30:32,704 --> 00:30:33,472
Unhinged

704
00:30:33,728 --> 00:30:37,824
I don't know I it was irresponsible to have you by text that I don't know what I'm talkin

705
00:30:42,688 --> 00:30:43,200
So

706
00:30:43,456 --> 00:30:44,736
Alex picks up on this

707
00:30:44,992 --> 00:30:45,760
And he's like

708
00:30:46,272 --> 00:30:46,784
Great

709
00:30:47,296 --> 00:30:48,320
This is quite interesting

710
00:30:49,088 --> 00:30:49,856
MSNBC

711
00:30:50,112 --> 00:30:50,880
Chris Matthews

712
00:30:51,136 --> 00:30:52,160
Suggest

713
00:30:52,672 --> 00:30:54,720
Assassinate political opponents

714
00:30:57,024 --> 00:30:57,536
Now

715
00:30:58,304 --> 00:31:00,096
Hillary has a bunch of people around her

716
00:31:06,496 --> 00:31:07,008
The Hat

717
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:11,104
If you read that on the are they saying it's a Publix

718
00:31:13,152 --> 00:31:14,432
Corner in Arkansas

719
00:31:14,688 --> 00:31:18,016
Arms legs and heads

720
00:31:18,272 --> 00:31:19,040
Cut off

721
00:31:19,296 --> 00:31:21,088
Plastic bags

722
00:31:21,856 --> 00:31:23,392
And they said the person committed suicide

723
00:31:24,928 --> 00:31:28,768
So it's it's pretty fun that Alex is doubling down on Chris Matthews suggest

724
00:31:29,024 --> 00:31:31,072
Bernie will kill political opponents based on nothing

725
00:31:31,328 --> 00:31:35,936
And at the same time celebrating Trump firing people who testified against him and clear active

726
00:31:36,192 --> 00:31:37,984
Retaliation for the

727
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:44,384
I don't really care what Chris Matthews dumbass so I'm not even getting engaged with that I wanted to talk

728
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:45,152
Call Derrick Rose

729
00:31:45,408 --> 00:31:48,736
If I wanted to talk about these Hillary murders a little bit

730
00:31:48,992 --> 00:31:54,368
Before we get into any of this it's my favorite Agatha Christie novel by the way the Hillary murder sure

731
00:31:54,624 --> 00:31:57,440
Tomorrow

732
00:31:58,464 --> 00:32:00,256
The Belgian hits the bottom of

733
00:32:00,512 --> 00:32:01,280
He's not friends

734
00:32:01,792 --> 00:32:07,936
Before we get into any of this just just off the top this is all just a part of that dumb Clinton Body Bag s*** that was started by the

735
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:08,704
Bway Coke

736
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,240
Conspiracy theorist named Linda

737
00:32:10,496 --> 00:32:11,776
The Thompson back in the 90s

738
00:32:12,032 --> 00:32:12,544
Is way too attached

739
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:13,312
Text Bill Clinton

740
00:32:13,824 --> 00:32:17,408
People have gone over this list of people who were quote-unquote close to the clintons who died

741
00:32:17,664 --> 00:32:18,688
None of them really stand up to

742
00:32:18,944 --> 00:32:19,456
Scrutiny at all

743
00:32:19,968 --> 00:32:21,248
Interesting Lee though

744
00:32:21,504 --> 00:32:25,088
Linda Thompson appeared as a guest on Bill Cooper show The Hour of the time

745
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,112
15

746
00:32:26,368 --> 00:32:32,512
Gametime nice very regular alright hey

747
00:32:33,024 --> 00:32:36,352
I listen to one and it was very boring there might be some other gems

748
00:32:36,864 --> 00:32:37,888
We'll see if Hillary

749
00:32:38,144 --> 00:32:39,936
Clinton kills anybody else I'm sure she'll be back on

750
00:32:40,448 --> 00:32:40,960
I think

751
00:32:41,728 --> 00:32:43,264
It might be too late for Bill Cooper

752
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:45,056
Yeah he's not on there anymore

753
00:32:45,312 --> 00:32:46,336
So

754
00:32:46,592 --> 00:32:47,360
The first case

755
00:32:47,616 --> 00:32:49,152
But Alex brings up his Ron Brown

756
00:32:49,408 --> 00:32:49,920
Okay

757
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:50,944
Ron Brown was he

758
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:54,016
First African-American to be chairman of the Democratic National Committee

759
00:32:54,528 --> 00:32:56,576
And then went Clinton was elected Brown became

760
00:32:56,832 --> 00:32:58,624
The first African-American to serve as set

761
00:32:58,880 --> 00:32:59,392
Secretary of Commerce

762
00:33:00,416 --> 00:33:05,280
On April 3rd 1996 you was one of 35 people who were tragically killed in a plane crash

763
00:33:05,536 --> 00:33:06,304
Over Croatia

764
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:09,376
Are based on a small detail in the coroner's report

765
00:33:09,632 --> 00:33:10,400
Conspiracy theorist

766
00:33:10,912 --> 00:33:12,960
Started spreading all this s*** about his death

767
00:33:13,728 --> 00:33:18,592
An x-ray showed what appeared to be a small round wound which folks decided must be a bullet hole

768
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:21,920
This theory is super weak considering that the x-rays

769
00:33:22,176 --> 00:33:24,480
Suspiciously did not also include a bullet

770
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:25,760
Eddie bonebrake

771
00:33:26,016 --> 00:33:27,040
Mites or an exit wound

772
00:33:27,552 --> 00:33:29,600
Which makes it super unlikely that he was shot

773
00:33:30,112 --> 00:33:31,648
Why don't they make the bullets out of

774
00:33:31,904 --> 00:33:33,952
The Black Box you know what I'm saying

775
00:33:34,464 --> 00:33:40,608
There's so much more than needs to be explained for this to be plausibly presented as a murder in neither Alex nor any of the Clinton conspiracy

776
00:33:40,864 --> 00:33:42,144
Secret has ever provided any

777
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,424
Closer an explanation

778
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:45,216
For how they think this went down

779
00:33:45,472 --> 00:33:47,264
Like let's say you was

780
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:48,288
Did the shot

781
00:33:49,824 --> 00:33:53,664
They just dragged him on the plane ever got on the plane with a dead body and I

782
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:59,552
No obviously the way this goes down is a d.b. Cooper style f******

783
00:33:59,808 --> 00:34:00,576
Hijacking

784
00:34:00,832 --> 00:34:03,904
The CIA agent or NSA agent or whatever you want

785
00:34:04,672 --> 00:34:05,952
Breaks into the plane

786
00:34:06,208 --> 00:34:12,352
Set sit down kills the pilot says we're all going down then walks into the into the

787
00:34:12,608 --> 00:34:14,656
Fuselage shoots the guy and then jumps out the

788
00:34:14,912 --> 00:34:15,424
Beside

789
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:16,960
Paris

790
00:34:17,216 --> 00:34:19,264
Why do you need me to do

791
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:20,032
Plane crash

792
00:34:20,288 --> 00:34:26,432
The Kills everybody psychically eating everybody else and only games their strength and comes back

793
00:34:26,688 --> 00:34:27,456
Back to bite you in the ass

794
00:34:27,712 --> 00:34:30,016
That makes perfect sense of interesting ideas

795
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:37,184
But like I said there's a lot more than needs to be flushed out the people have failed to do that so that's what I'm not

796
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:38,464
Not going Scout Jose

797
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:42,048
Clinton murder

798
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:46,144
So as for Sami Malek

799
00:34:46,656 --> 00:34:50,240
What else is referring to here is the case of Don Henry and Kevin Ives

800
00:34:51,008 --> 00:34:56,384
I have no idea what he's talking about with suicide and people in bags and all that stuff but he's clearly talking about these

801
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:57,152
2 guy

802
00:34:57,664 --> 00:35:00,480
Henry and Ives age 16 and 17 respect

803
00:35:00,736 --> 00:35:01,760
They were hit by the

804
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:03,040
4:25 a.m.

805
00:35:03,296 --> 00:35:05,088
I'm praying on August 23rd

806
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:06,112
1887

807
00:35:06,368 --> 00:35:07,136
As they lay on the

808
00:35:08,416 --> 00:35:11,744
They've been out hunting and had some weed in their system which may have led to

809
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:13,792
To the corner family family Malik

810
00:35:14,304 --> 00:35:19,168
Yeah to conclude that they were passed out from the weed and got hit by a train haven't fallen asleep on the tracks

811
00:35:19,936 --> 00:35:22,752
The families did not accept that determination so they got a second

812
00:35:23,008 --> 00:35:24,288
And opinion and the information

813
00:35:24,544 --> 00:35:25,312
The came up made it seem

814
00:35:25,568 --> 00:35:27,104
Very clear that these kids were murdered

815
00:35:27,872 --> 00:35:34,016
For instance they found a stab wound in one of their backs and the second Corner found the dead waitlist weed and then Malik

816
00:35:34,272 --> 00:35:35,552
Get suggested did she miss

817
00:35:35,808 --> 00:35:36,576
The stab wound

818
00:35:36,832 --> 00:35:38,368
He ant

819
00:35:38,624 --> 00:35:40,928
I assume that the explanation be like you

820
00:35:41,184 --> 00:35:42,208
Just think it's a train

821
00:35:42,464 --> 00:35:42,976
Wound

822
00:35:43,232 --> 00:35:44,256
Or something like that

823
00:35:44,768 --> 00:35:46,816
Yeah well maybe

824
00:35:48,352 --> 00:35:49,632
From here all sorts of

825
00:35:49,888 --> 00:35:50,400
Conspiracy started

826
00:35:50,656 --> 00:35:52,192
Swirling around about how these kids must

827
00:35:52,448 --> 00:35:58,336
Accidentally seeing something they shouldn't have like a drug deal that would implicate then governor of Arkansas Bill Clinton

828
00:35:58,592 --> 00:36:00,384
No this is ever been proven and it's

829
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:03,456
But it is accepted as Truth by the Clinton conspiracy crowd

830
00:36:03,712 --> 00:36:04,736
I see that is a bit of a

831
00:36:05,504 --> 00:36:06,272
It is yeah

832
00:36:06,528 --> 00:36:11,648
From where I'm sitting I think it's entirely possible that family Malik was just super super bad at his job

833
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:16,768
He quit his position in 1991 under harsh criticism that he had a pattern of botching on top

834
00:36:18,304 --> 00:36:23,680
There was the 1989 case of Olivia Ward what you determined to be a murder but further examination

835
00:36:23,936 --> 00:36:24,448
Found to be in

836
00:36:24,704 --> 00:36:25,216
Inclusive

837
00:36:25,472 --> 00:36:25,984
Was no evidence

838
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:27,008
Murder at all

839
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:33,152
It's not like he always bungled cases but the case of Henry and Ives was definitely not an isolated incident

840
00:36:33,664 --> 00:36:35,200
His tenure at the coroner's office

841
00:36:35,456 --> 00:36:37,504
And the other cases he made mistakes and don't

842
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:38,784
Any relation to

843
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:39,552
Do the clintons

844
00:36:39,808 --> 00:36:41,088
Nor does Henry and Ives

845
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:44,416
Unless you are operating off gases and theories

846
00:36:44,672 --> 00:36:46,208
That aren't substantiated who are

847
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:49,280
So Alex is these two examples of Clinton murders

848
00:36:49,536 --> 00:36:50,048
But he throws out

849
00:36:50,304 --> 00:36:53,376
Pretending that they're solidly proven but it they're absolutely not

850
00:36:53,632 --> 00:36:55,168
Who's all this job old right wing

851
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:56,192
A seashell

852
00:36:56,448 --> 00:37:02,080
And more to the point even if Hillary killed every person she's ever met in her life

853
00:37:02,336 --> 00:37:05,152
That has nothing to do with Bernie if you forgotten

854
00:37:05,408 --> 00:37:06,176
Hillary hates

855
00:37:06,688 --> 00:37:10,784
Yeah yeah but that's only because Bernie has also killed everyone

856
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:15,648
He's at four pm the two of them are on a collision On the Border contact

857
00:37:15,904 --> 00:37:16,928
Yeah

858
00:37:17,696 --> 00:37:20,768
This election season is going to be

859
00:37:21,024 --> 00:37:22,304
The ugly even in ID

860
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:23,328
Dot situation

861
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:24,352
And Circumstance

862
00:37:24,864 --> 00:37:31,008
The last thing we need is Chris Matthew saying dumb s*** like Bernie might kill people

863
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:33,824
Did the video.

864
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,896
And the way that that certificate

865
00:37:37,152 --> 00:37:40,736
I don't know if it's a lack of awareness or a lack of caring or how that's going

866
00:37:40,992 --> 00:37:42,784
Be used by people like Alex

867
00:37:43,296 --> 00:37:45,856
But let me know before f****** careful

868
00:37:46,624 --> 00:37:47,136
So

869
00:37:47,648 --> 00:37:50,208
I don't think the people on TV who have opinions

870
00:37:50,464 --> 00:37:52,000
Know what they're talking about ever

871
00:37:52,256 --> 00:37:53,280
I think they might be just as

872
00:37:54,304 --> 00:37:56,608
Keep your ear your argument is it looks

873
00:37:56,864 --> 00:37:57,888
Stronger

874
00:37:58,144 --> 00:37:59,168
By the day

875
00:37:59,936 --> 00:38:06,080
So I thought that this is just going to be a Chris Matthews talks about Bernie killing people and then Alex gets to

876
00:38:06,336 --> 00:38:07,104
Go off on a Clinton

877
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:08,640
Conspiracy Jag

878
00:38:08,896 --> 00:38:09,664
I thought that was

879
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:10,432
Yeah

880
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:16,576
I thought maybe

881
00:38:16,832 --> 00:38:19,904
Just going to rehash some of these old Quinn bodybag things

882
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:20,928
Sure Alex will be like

883
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:22,208
And I miss Larry Nichols

884
00:38:22,464 --> 00:38:24,512
I thought that was going to be at

885
00:38:25,024 --> 00:38:25,536
No

886
00:38:26,048 --> 00:38:27,072
It turns out Alex's

887
00:38:27,584 --> 00:38:28,096
Decided like

888
00:38:28,608 --> 00:38:29,632
Why not play with fire

889
00:38:30,144 --> 00:38:31,936
African people have been sued

890
00:38:32,192 --> 00:38:33,216
Lawyers

891
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:35,776
Just questioning

892
00:38:36,544 --> 00:38:38,848
Governmental

Orbitz

894
00:38:41,408 --> 00:38:41,920
Haha

895
00:38:43,712 --> 00:38:44,224
I lying about

896
00:38:45,504 --> 00:38:46,528
Seth rich

897
00:38:46,784 --> 00:38:47,552
Attorney claim

898
00:38:49,344 --> 00:38:53,184
One America news isn't scared they talked to the lawyer lawyer says it goes all weapons

899
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:57,024
We're going to go all the way up to the top

900
00:38:57,280 --> 00:39:00,864
Easy

901
00:39:01,376 --> 00:39:02,400
Drool

902
00:39:07,776 --> 00:39:08,288
Sure

903
00:39:11,616 --> 00:39:13,920
It's legitimate there's that you might do that mean something

904
00:39:19,808 --> 00:39:21,088
I guess now

905
00:39:21,856 --> 00:39:22,368
Asking

906
00:39:24,928 --> 00:39:25,440
Coming up

907
00:39:25,952 --> 00:39:32,096
Alex better be really f****** careful or else he's going to f*** around and get himself sued

908
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:36,192
This is not the road you want to go down Alex

909
00:39:36,448 --> 00:39:38,240
Here's a here's the thing he's making

910
00:39:38,496 --> 00:39:42,848
Sobador buddy now he's like I'm playing with the house so I might as well go hard

911
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:44,896
Seth rich

912
00:39:45,408 --> 00:39:47,712
Whatever on a Serta

913
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:54,112
A slander Mania episode

914
00:39:54,368 --> 00:39:57,184
Dylan evil guy in the friggin and rapist has already said

915
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:58,720
That's true he has already

916
00:39:58,976 --> 00:40:01,792
God dammit so this is a story that Alex is covering

917
00:40:02,048 --> 00:40:04,608
About like one America news network is

918
00:40:04,864 --> 00:40:07,680
But it is outside with discovering that it's about a couple of emails

919
00:40:07,936 --> 00:40:09,216
It turned up in a foia request

920
00:40:09,472 --> 00:40:10,496
For all the emails but

921
00:40:10,752 --> 00:40:11,776
Peter strzok and Lisa

922
00:40:12,032 --> 00:40:12,544
To page

923
00:40:13,056 --> 00:40:15,616
There were couple emails regarding Seth rich but

924
00:40:15,872 --> 00:40:17,152
It's pretty important to recognize me

925
00:40:17,408 --> 00:40:17,920
Contacts

926
00:40:18,176 --> 00:40:19,200
Of these interactions

927
00:40:21,504 --> 00:40:23,296
Seth Rich died on July 10th

928
00:40:23,552 --> 00:40:25,344
2016 these emails are for

929
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:26,112
From August

930
00:40:27,904 --> 00:40:30,976
They're not really about Seth rich or any investigation of his death

931
00:40:31,488 --> 00:40:35,840
It's very clear from the first email in the chain that this was specifically about claims that Juliana

932
00:40:36,096 --> 00:40:36,864
The song should be making

933
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:39,680
Really vaguely in the media that suffrage was the

934
00:40:39,936 --> 00:40:41,728
The source of the emails that Wikileaks published

935
00:40:42,496 --> 00:40:45,056
This email the initial one is from the public

936
00:40:45,312 --> 00:40:45,824
Affairs office

937
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:47,360
Saudi media relations sex

938
00:40:47,616 --> 00:40:48,384
The FBI

939
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:49,408
Asking some folks

940
00:40:49,664 --> 00:40:50,944
Does the FBI had any involved

941
00:40:52,224 --> 00:40:58,368
There are a lot of parts retracted for who knows what reason but the exchange as it appears seems to be them saying that there

942
00:40:58,624 --> 00:41:00,416
There is no FBI involvement

943
00:41:00,672 --> 00:41:04,768
Limas got caught up in this play request because straw candidate for forwarding

944
00:41:05,024 --> 00:41:06,048
The email to page

945
00:41:06,304 --> 00:41:07,584
Who was an FBI lawyer

946
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,120
Looping her in on the situation

947
00:41:09,632 --> 00:41:11,424
In case there's any legal

948
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:12,192
Right

949
00:41:12,448 --> 00:41:16,800
None of this seems very suspicious at all unless you already believe that Hillary had set for

950
00:41:17,056 --> 00:41:17,568
Bridge killed

951
00:41:17,824 --> 00:41:19,872
And you let your imagination run wild about the

952
00:41:20,128 --> 00:41:20,896
The parts that are redacted

953
00:41:21,664 --> 00:41:24,736
I'm very much unimpressed with this development in the case of this evidence

954
00:41:24,992 --> 00:41:26,784
I think it demonstrates literally nothing

955
00:41:27,296 --> 00:41:28,320
But I am very

956
00:41:28,832 --> 00:41:30,624
Very worried for Alex's beagles

957
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:31,648
Situation

958
00:41:31,904 --> 00:41:35,232
I just don't have faith in his ability to thread needles anymore

959
00:41:35,488 --> 00:41:38,048
If he gets to talk about this case I'm almost there

960
00:41:38,304 --> 00:41:39,840
You can end up slander today

961
00:41:40,096 --> 00:41:41,376
He can't stop himself

962
00:41:41,632 --> 00:41:42,912
He just can't why did

963
00:41:43,424 --> 00:41:45,728
Why isn't there somebody there to like just

964
00:41:45,984 --> 00:41:47,264
The Roshan at his head

965
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:49,568
Be like no no no Seth rich

966
00:41:49,824 --> 00:41:51,360
Like if you hear Seth Rich number

967
00:41:51,616 --> 00:41:52,384
Some kind of like

968
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:55,199
Can should come out and hit him in the side of the head it goes

969
00:41:55,455 --> 00:41:55,967
Your good point

970
00:41:56,223 --> 00:42:02,367
You remember how bad your hand week your s*** was before

971
00:42:02,623 --> 00:42:05,695
The Jerome corsi was telling you a sudhir

972
00:42:05,951 --> 00:42:07,487
Each other anymore

973
00:42:08,255 --> 00:42:11,583
You really need to be careful Alex this is not a road you want to go down

974
00:42:12,095 --> 00:42:13,375
Sup but it turns out Alex

975
00:42:13,631 --> 00:42:16,703
Basically a professor in like criminal justice

976
00:42:16,959 --> 00:42:19,263
He starts telling you how you do an investor

977
00:42:19,519 --> 00:42:20,799
Sagacious

978
00:42:21,055 --> 00:42:22,079
Talkabouttd

979
00:42:23,615 --> 00:42:24,639
Gather

980
00:42:26,431 --> 00:42:27,711
Brina bring on Columbo

981
00:42:28,991 --> 00:42:33,087
Oh I also should point out that like this is after he does like a 3-minute like

982
00:42:33,855 --> 00:42:34,367
I love

983
00:42:34,879 --> 00:42:39,743
The song Stranglehold Stranglehold

984
00:42:39,999 --> 00:42:40,511
Position

985
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:42,047
F****** hate 311

986
00:42:42,815 --> 00:42:45,375
Ted Nugent that's where it's at

987
00:42:45,631 --> 00:42:46,911
He's got strong takes

988
00:42:47,167 --> 00:42:51,775
So that strong take that's why he's like we got to get down to some serious

989
00:42:52,031 --> 00:42:53,055
Ted Nugent for 3 minutes

990
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:56,895
Someone who is in Paula

991
00:42:57,407 --> 00:42:58,687
X dies

992
00:42:59,199 --> 00:42:59,711
Getting shot

993
00:42:59,967 --> 00:43:00,991
Couple times in the back

994
00:43:02,783 --> 00:43:04,319
Completely legitimate

995
00:43:04,575 --> 00:43:05,343
To speculate

996
00:43:06,367 --> 00:43:07,135
About why

997
00:43:07,903 --> 00:43:08,415
And how

998
00:43:09,439 --> 00:43:12,255
It happened and who could be behind and who stands to gain the old

999
00:43:12,511 --> 00:43:14,303
Roman saying

1000
00:43:15,583 --> 00:43:17,631
Kubota who benefits

1001
00:43:21,215 --> 00:43:23,519
The first thing you look at is

1002
00:43:24,031 --> 00:43:25,055
Benefit from this

1003
00:43:25,311 --> 00:43:26,591
And then who has the means

1004
00:43:27,615 --> 00:43:29,919
EBenefits

1005
00:43:32,223 --> 00:43:33,503
The ability to carry it out

1006
00:43:34,015 --> 00:43:37,855
That means he's repeating himself also please Alex

1007
00:43:38,623 --> 00:43:39,391
Demonstrate

1008
00:43:39,647 --> 00:43:45,023
Kibo know about the separation

1009
00:43:46,047 --> 00:43:47,071
Please

1010
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:48,863
I don't even think you can do that

1011
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:49,887
Absolutely

1012
00:43:50,399 --> 00:43:51,167
So Alex

1013
00:43:51,423 --> 00:43:53,215
Like really is in trouble.

1014
00:43:53,727 --> 00:43:54,239
Buc-ee's

1015
00:43:54,495 --> 00:43:57,823
He's going down the road and talking about Seth Rich again and like

1016
00:43:58,079 --> 00:44:02,175
If he I can't stress this enough if he keeps going down this road it's going to be trouble

1017
00:44:02,687 --> 00:44:03,967
But not for the reasons he thinks

1018
00:44:04,479 --> 00:44:08,575
If you talk about Seth Rich you get to it by the DNC funded law firms

1019
00:44:12,671 --> 00:44:13,951
Lawsuits

1020
00:44:14,975 --> 00:44:15,487
Name of

1021
00:44:23,423 --> 00:44:25,727
They don't want you looking into it but you know

1022
00:44:25,983 --> 00:44:26,751
The data

1023
00:44:28,543 --> 00:44:29,567
Via somebody soon

1024
00:44:33,407 --> 00:44:34,175
Family Court

1025
00:44:35,455 --> 00:44:36,479
The download

1026
00:44:39,551 --> 00:44:40,063
Information

1027
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:40,831
On the

1028
00:44:42,111 --> 00:44:43,135
Pat vncc

1029
00:44:49,279 --> 00:44:50,047
Time in happen

1030
00:44:51,839 --> 00:44:52,351
6 * 5

1031
00:44:54,143 --> 00:44:55,679
Then any streaming service

1032
00:44:55,935 --> 00:44:56,959
Capability in the world

1033
00:44:58,239 --> 00:44:59,775
So quick point

1034
00:45:00,031 --> 00:45:03,359
Sued for spreading misinformation about Seth Rich are not getting sued by the DM

1035
00:45:03,615 --> 00:45:04,383
MC your Hillary Clinton

1036
00:45:04,639 --> 00:45:06,175
They're getting sued by Seth riches

1037
00:45:06,431 --> 00:45:08,223
Parents who have been very clear the past

1038
00:45:08,479 --> 00:45:09,759
The therapy traumatize

1039
00:45:10,015 --> 00:45:11,295
By having their son's tragic death

1040
00:45:11,551 --> 00:45:12,319
Being used for

1041
00:45:12,575 --> 00:45:13,087
Political proper

1042
00:45:13,343 --> 00:45:13,855
Buganda

1043
00:45:14,111 --> 00:45:16,927
There aren't 100 suits about this I was just making that up

1044
00:45:17,183 --> 00:45:19,743
To seem like the DNC and Hillary are desperate to do a cover-up

1045
00:45:19,999 --> 00:45:23,583
When in reality it's just a family fighting back against people who cause them harm

1046
00:45:24,095 --> 00:45:30,239
Seems like a theme and Alex's career seems like he hurts people

1047
00:45:31,519 --> 00:45:37,663
For some reason also that's about the download speed being too fast to be a hacker

1048
00:45:37,919 --> 00:45:38,431
I'm Court

1049
00:45:38,687 --> 00:45:41,503
That stuff that passed Infowars guests William Binney

1050
00:45:41,759 --> 00:45:44,319
It claimed which I was used to give credibility to

1051
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:45,343
To the narrative that Russian

1052
00:45:45,599 --> 00:45:47,391
Unintelligent couldn't have been behind the app

1053
00:45:47,647 --> 00:45:49,695
And in fact it had to be an inside job

1054
00:45:49,951 --> 00:45:51,231
Because the speeds were so quick

1055
00:45:51,487 --> 00:45:52,511
It had to be you USB

1056
00:45:53,023 --> 00:45:54,559
Drive

1057
00:45:54,815 --> 00:45:56,351
These files would not have been done

1058
00:45:56,607 --> 00:45:59,423
No there's no such thing as a fast internet

1059
00:46:00,191 --> 00:46:04,543
So the first problem was that this claim that the speed at which the files were downloaded

1060
00:46:04,799 --> 00:46:06,847
22.7 MB

1061
00:46:07,103 --> 00:46:07,615
Per second

1062
00:46:07,871 --> 00:46:09,663
Exceeded available internet download speed

1063
00:46:10,175 --> 00:46:11,455
That isn't true

1064
00:46:11,711 --> 00:46:15,807
Available internet connection

1065
00:46:16,063 --> 00:46:18,623
All over the world

1066
00:46:19,135 --> 00:46:21,951
Just based on that little bit of information this theory is shaky

1067
00:46:22,975 --> 00:46:23,999
As it turns out

1068
00:46:24,255 --> 00:46:25,023
Benny wasn't work

1069
00:46:25,279 --> 00:46:29,631
Confirm any real analysis of his own he was just using information he'd received from a man named

1070
00:46:29,887 --> 00:46:30,655
Adam Carter

1071
00:46:30,911 --> 00:46:32,703
Who was allegedly a researcher and tecca

1072
00:46:33,471 --> 00:46:35,775
As it turns out Adam Carter's real name was

1073
00:46:36,031 --> 00:46:36,543
Tim Leonard

1074
00:46:36,799 --> 00:46:39,103
And he was less an expert as he was a 39

1075
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:40,639
9 year old troll from the United

1076
00:46:40,895 --> 00:46:42,431
Kingdom of a track record

1077
00:46:42,687 --> 00:46:44,991
Insperity misinformation on Reddit 4chan

1078
00:46:45,247 --> 00:46:46,271
Most of it too

1079
00:46:46,527 --> 00:46:47,807
Damn dude how Russia didn't hack

1080
00:46:48,063 --> 00:46:50,367
Accident that does seem that does he

1081
00:46:51,135 --> 00:46:54,463
You even created a second mysterious identity called forensic

1082
00:46:54,719 --> 00:46:56,767
Gator what you use to prop up the findings

1083
00:46:57,023 --> 00:47:01,631
Of his other they worked in concert to prop each other up

1084
00:47:01,887 --> 00:47:02,911
Pick that up for a Full Slate

1085
00:47:03,167 --> 00:47:06,495
This shell game a fake identities was tracked down by info

1086
00:47:06,751 --> 00:47:08,287
Security researcher inexpert Duncan

1087
00:47:08,543 --> 00:47:09,055
Campbell

1088
00:47:09,311 --> 00:47:11,615
Interesting consequences

1089
00:47:12,639 --> 00:47:15,967
Under his Adam Carter Alias Leonard operated website called G

1090
00:47:16,223 --> 00:47:19,551
G Dash 2.0 couldn't have been

1091
00:47:19,807 --> 00:47:20,575
Russian intelligence

1092
00:47:21,343 --> 00:47:26,207
Through this site Leonard sent William Benny of file the claim to show that the hack was an inside job

1093
00:47:26,719 --> 00:47:27,999
I'll read to you hear from Dunkin

1094
00:47:28,255 --> 00:47:29,791
Can Campbell's piece about his research

1095
00:47:30,047 --> 00:47:31,583
It was published in computer week

1096
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:34,911
The Untitled file included complex

1097
00:47:35,167 --> 00:47:39,775
Text details explaining how to unlock information inside of tranche of files released by goose

1098
00:47:40,031 --> 00:47:40,799
42.0 it Lund

1099
00:47:41,567 --> 00:47:43,615
Metadata in the files had been manipulate

1100
00:47:44,127 --> 00:47:44,639
Diprove

1101
00:47:44,895 --> 00:47:45,407
That the

1102
00:47:45,663 --> 00:47:47,967
Could not have been could have been stolen

1103
00:47:48,479 --> 00:47:50,015
I only buy a Democratic National

00:47:50,271 --> 00:47:51,039
Committee employee

1105
00:47:51,295 --> 00:47:54,623
This is a file that was sent to me had manipulated metadata

1106
00:47:54,879 --> 00:47:55,391
Which made it a

1107
00:47:55,647 --> 00:47:58,207
Appear that the download was impossible except

1108
00:47:58,463 --> 00:47:59,231
Local 8 check

1109
00:47:59,487 --> 00:48:01,279
Benny didn't know analysis on the files

1110
00:48:01,535 --> 00:48:02,815
Himself but instead took this

1111
00:48:03,071 --> 00:48:04,351
Information and took it is Gospel

1112
00:48:04,863 --> 00:48:08,703
The work into this file was attributed to Leonard's other Alias forensics

1113
00:48:09,215 --> 00:48:10,495
And from there

1114
00:48:12,031 --> 00:48:12,543
Justine's

1115
00:48:12,799 --> 00:48:13,823
Credible by Benny

1116
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:14,847
Without further question

1117
00:48:16,639 --> 00:48:20,991
Baby began making the rounds with right-wing media offering this Smoking Gun that it wasn't rushing

1118
00:48:21,247 --> 00:48:21,759
Tim Hagan

1119
00:48:22,015 --> 00:48:23,551
His claims are all over Breitbart

1120
00:48:23,807 --> 00:48:26,111
Hannity and of course he showed up a bunch on Infowars

1121
00:48:26,623 --> 00:48:28,671
His claims even made it all the way to

1122
00:48:29,439 --> 00:48:31,487
Who told then CIA director Mike

1123
00:48:31,743 --> 00:48:33,023
Pompeo to meet with Benny

1124
00:48:33,535 --> 00:48:35,327
To get information that would prove that Russia

1125
00:48:35,583 --> 00:48:37,375
You acted ENC

1126
00:48:37,631 --> 00:48:38,143
God

1127
00:48:38,655 --> 00:48:39,935
But he knows that they

1128
00:48:40,191 --> 00:48:43,263
Pompeo did meet with things

1129
00:48:43,519 --> 00:48:44,799
Damn it and that makes this

1130
00:48:45,055 --> 00:48:47,103
Very sad especially considering the neck

1131
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:47,871
Next development

1132
00:48:48,639 --> 00:48:49,663
Duncan Campbell was able to

1133
00:48:49,919 --> 00:48:51,455
Forget William Benny to visit Britain

1134
00:48:51,711 --> 00:48:52,223
I've analyzed

1135
00:48:52,479 --> 00:48:55,551
The actual data contained to the actual Goose for files and

1136
00:48:55,807 --> 00:48:57,343
Quote a month after visiting

1137
00:48:57,599 --> 00:48:58,879
CIA headquarters

1138
00:48:59,135 --> 00:49:00,159
Benny came to a Brit

1139
00:49:00,671 --> 00:49:02,463
After re-examining the data ended

1140
00:49:02,719 --> 00:49:06,047
Goose 42.0 files thoroughly with the author of this article

1141
00:49:06,303 --> 00:49:07,071
Changed his mind

1142
00:49:07,583 --> 00:49:08,607
He said there was quotes

1143
00:49:08,863 --> 00:49:09,375
No evidence

1144
00:49:09,631 --> 00:49:11,679
To prove where the download copy was done

1145
00:49:12,191 --> 00:49:15,519
The goose 42.0 files analyzed by Leonard's G2 space

1146
00:49:16,031 --> 00:49:17,311
Or quote manipulated

1147
00:49:17,567 --> 00:49:18,591
He said and a quote

1148
00:49:18,847 --> 00:49:19,359
Fabricate

1149
00:49:20,383 --> 00:49:24,735
Even William Benny has come out and admitted that the basis for his claims about download speeds

1150
00:49:24,991 --> 00:49:25,503
And how it's

1151
00:49:25,759 --> 00:49:26,527
Impossible that the hack

1152
00:49:26,783 --> 00:49:29,599
Wasn't it in-house operation was b******* and if a

1153
00:49:30,367 --> 00:49:31,135
There's nothing

1154
00:49:31,391 --> 00:49:32,159
Here other than

1155
00:49:32,415 --> 00:49:33,183
Supposed expert Guetta

1156
00:49:33,695 --> 00:49:35,999
Buy a troll in the process tricking the f***

1157
00:49:36,255 --> 00:49:36,767
Can president

1158
00:49:37,279 --> 00:49:43,423
Alex is lying saying that the information came out in court when in reality was b******* that he unquestioningly accepted from

1159
00:49:43,679 --> 00:49:44,191
William Binney

1160
00:49:44,447 --> 00:49:45,983
Unquestioningly accepted it

1161
00:49:46,239 --> 00:49:46,751
From Leonard

1162
00:49:47,007 --> 00:49:49,055
Oz reopening is interesting to Seth rich

1163
00:49:49,311 --> 00:49:50,591
It was a really bad idea

1164
00:49:50,847 --> 00:49:55,199
And defending the decision based on lies about things as sources don't even still believe

1165
00:49:55,455 --> 00:49:56,735
This is bad news

1166
00:49:56,991 --> 00:50:00,575
That must have been a real bummer for Benny whenever it got too far

1167
00:50:01,343 --> 00:50:05,439
Confetti had to admit that it was bulshit cuz if he if it didn't go all the way up

1168
00:50:05,695 --> 00:50:06,207
Depompeo

1169
00:50:07,487 --> 00:50:08,511
He wouldn't have retract

1170
00:50:08,767 --> 00:50:10,303
Did that he'd still be alive

1171
00:50:11,839 --> 00:50:13,631
Duncan Campbell

1172
00:50:14,655 --> 00:50:18,239
Still gone through the process that he did a figuring all this stuff out

1173
00:50:18,495 --> 00:50:19,263
And

1174
00:50:19,775 --> 00:50:21,311
Convince William Benny to come

1175
00:50:21,567 --> 00:50:23,103
Do the work over with him jack

1176
00:50:23,615 --> 00:50:25,407
I imagine the Benny would have been like

1177
00:50:25,663 --> 00:50:26,431
Yeah you know what

1178
00:50:26,687 --> 00:50:28,223
You're right

1179
00:50:29,247 --> 00:50:34,367
I just halfway expect all of these people to take a f****** mask off and reveal that there Jacob wohlander

1180
00:50:34,879 --> 00:50:40,767
Like these people are all insane but that's another one of Alex's big narratives about Seth rich is the guy investigating him

1181
00:50:41,023 --> 00:50:41,535
Got shot

1182
00:50:42,047 --> 00:50:42,815
For investigating

1183
00:50:44,351 --> 00:50:46,143
Is that the guy Burton

1184
00:50:46,655 --> 00:50:48,191
Who works

1185
00:50:53,823 --> 00:50:55,871
He got shot with like a BB gun

1186
00:50:56,127 --> 00:51:02,271
Beat by a guy who you was collaborating on a separate investigation with because the investigation toward south

1187
00:51:02,527 --> 00:51:03,039
This is what I'm saying

1188
00:51:03,295 --> 00:51:05,599
These people are all children. Burton Burke

1189
00:51:05,855 --> 00:51:06,879
Yeah

1190
00:51:07,135 --> 00:51:09,439
All of this

1191
00:51:09,951 --> 00:51:10,463
Is b*******

1192
00:51:10,719 --> 00:51:11,743
It's it's

1193
00:51:12,511 --> 00:51:13,535
It's outrageous it's going to

1194
00:51:13,791 --> 00:51:16,095
If you keep going down this road

1195
00:51:16,351 --> 00:51:21,983
Great but I'm excited to see if he does it's dangerous it is nice to see him

1196
00:51:22,239 --> 00:51:25,823
Get all that money and then Rush as fast as he can to get sued

1197
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:27,103
To get it all taken away again

1198
00:51:27,359 --> 00:51:29,407
Very strange

1199
00:51:29,663 --> 00:51:32,991
So another thing that might end up costing Alex a bit of money

1200
00:51:33,503 --> 00:51:35,807
He is now comfortably settled in

1201
00:51:36,063 --> 00:51:37,855
To selling his immune gargle

1202
00:51:38,111 --> 00:51:39,135
Based on a

1203
00:51:39,647 --> 00:51:41,695
Claim that it is

1204
00:51:41,951 --> 00:51:44,511
Good at preventing or helping with SARS

1205
00:51:44,767 --> 00:51:46,815
We have sold out of the 16 oz

1206
00:51:47,071 --> 00:51:49,119
I mean Largo that has the nanosilver

1207
00:51:49,631 --> 00:51:52,703
That's up at didn't documented even admitted in.

1208
00:51:53,215 --> 00:51:55,263
Coronavirus family

1209
00:51:55,519 --> 00:51:57,055
Viruses viruses and bacteria

1210
00:51:58,335 --> 00:51:58,847
So

1211
00:51:59,103 --> 00:52:01,407
Viruses are bacteria viruses

1212
00:52:01,663 --> 00:52:06,783
Standby

1213
00:52:07,295 --> 00:52:08,063
Did you

1214
00:52:08,319 --> 00:52:09,855
Cuz I know that he says that like

1215
00:52:10,111 --> 00:52:12,671
All cancer is virus

1216
00:52:12,927 --> 00:52:13,695
I know that he has some

1217
00:52:13,951 --> 00:52:15,487
Weird thoughts about science

1218
00:52:16,767 --> 00:52:17,791
But I think you said viruses

1219
00:52:18,303 --> 00:52:20,863
Yeah I would have assumed viruses and if we weren't

1220
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:21,631
Dealing with Alec

1221
00:52:21,887 --> 00:52:28,031
Viruses are bacteria is justice

1222
00:52:28,543 --> 00:52:31,103
So you got that it's like okay you

1223
00:52:31,615 --> 00:52:35,199
It's clear we've seen this path over the last like week or so that

1224
00:52:35,455 --> 00:52:35,967
Tentative

1225
00:52:36,479 --> 00:52:39,807
Dipping the toe into the pool of the biking these claim

1226
00:52:40,063 --> 00:52:42,111
Now you just totally comfortable with it is that why not

1227
00:52:42,367 --> 00:52:45,951
Let it let it ride consequences for me

1228
00:52:46,463 --> 00:52:48,255
Sojourn this next clip is long

1229
00:52:49,023 --> 00:52:49,791
And

1230
00:52:50,815 --> 00:52:51,327
It's very

1231
00:52:51,583 --> 00:52:52,351
Confusing

1232
00:52:52,863 --> 00:52:53,375
I

1233
00:52:54,143 --> 00:52:54,655
It wanted to

1234
00:52:54,911 --> 00:52:55,423
Cut clips

1235
00:52:56,703 --> 00:52:57,215
But I can't

1236
00:52:57,727 --> 00:52:59,007
I have to present it as a

1237
00:52:59,263 --> 00:53:00,031
This is a full second

1238
00:53:00,287 --> 00:53:05,151
Okay this is a 5-minute segment maybe 4 ish in the first segment of it

1239
00:53:05,407 --> 00:53:06,687
The second hour

1240
00:53:06,943 --> 00:53:08,991
It's where he's coming into the

1241
00:53:09,247 --> 00:53:11,295
The show and if that segment that isn't

1242
00:53:11,807 --> 00:53:13,343
Carried on every station

1243
00:53:13,855 --> 00:53:15,391
So sometimes it's a little bit strange

1244
00:53:16,159 --> 00:53:16,927
This one is very

1245
00:53:17,183 --> 00:53:17,695
Okay

1246
00:53:17,951 --> 00:53:19,743
I need you to take notes I need you to pick close

1247
00:53:19,999 --> 00:53:21,791
I know what you

1248
00:53:22,047 --> 00:53:24,607
A couple times

1249
00:53:24,863 --> 00:53:26,911
And I am very confused by this

1250
00:53:27,423 --> 00:53:27,935
It's

1251
00:53:28,191 --> 00:53:28,703
Very weird

1252
00:53:29,215 --> 00:53:32,287
When I hear about somebody dying

1253
00:53:32,799 --> 00:53:34,591
Have empathy II

1254
00:53:36,639 --> 00:53:38,175
The amount of the universe works

1255
00:53:38,431 --> 00:53:38,943
And Mojo.

1256
00:53:42,783 --> 00:53:45,087
Oh it's bad luck if I don't care if somebody gets hurt

1257
00:53:45,599 --> 00:53:46,367
Jenison

1258
00:53:46,879 --> 00:53:50,975
So at this point I have to pause because this is after talking about Seth rich

1259
00:53:51,231 --> 00:53:53,279
So I thought maybe he was talked about separate

1260
00:53:53,535 --> 00:53:57,887
We also talked about Rush Limbaugh and how he was going through a

1261
00:53:58,143 --> 00:54:00,191
I wasn't Wiki hopes 311.

1262
00:54:00,447 --> 00:54:02,239
But he doesn't

1263
00:54:02,495 --> 00:54:06,079
Now that's true if you look at the context

1264
00:54:06,335 --> 00:54:07,615
It seems more likely

1265
00:54:07,871 --> 00:54:08,383
It's about separate

1266
00:54:09,407 --> 00:54:09,919
The feelings at

1267
00:54:10,687 --> 00:54:12,735
I'm not sure I'm leaning towards Russia

1268
00:54:13,247 --> 00:54:15,039
Or it could be the people in China

1269
00:54:15,807 --> 00:54:18,879
I don't know maybe I guess that's why I don't think he cares about people

1270
00:54:19,647 --> 00:54:20,671
Don't know Alex

1271
00:54:23,231 --> 00:54:23,743
Spiritually know that

1272
00:54:27,839 --> 00:54:29,119
You think I know that but they'll

1273
00:54:32,703 --> 00:54:33,983
Because the laws of nature

1274
00:54:35,519 --> 00:54:38,847
That's why evil always goes wow I can do this

1275
00:54:39,615 --> 00:54:40,639
And this happens

1276
00:54:43,711 --> 00:54:46,527
But they don't think about the next couple things that happen

1277
00:54:48,063 --> 00:54:49,599
Nice

1278
00:54:50,879 --> 00:54:52,927
Is the best way to build a good civilization and

1279
00:54:53,183 --> 00:54:54,975
Good people around you that doing well

1280
00:54:56,767 --> 00:54:57,791
People aren't doing well

1281
00:54:58,047 --> 00:55:00,095
I don't care what color they are where they came from

1282
00:55:00,351 --> 00:55:01,887
How does that make me better

1283
00:55:05,215 --> 00:55:05,983
Because I have a spear

1284
00:55:06,495 --> 00:55:08,543
And I have a conscience and I care by nav

1285
00:55:09,311 --> 00:55:09,823
I have

1286
00:55:11,615 --> 00:55:14,943

Comes in

00:55:27,743 --> 00:55:29,279
People that are good and strong

1292
00:55:29,791 --> 00:55:33,375
Have to do the right thing when it comes down to it no we don't

1293
00:55:33,887 --> 00:55:37,471
Limitation when I fry some enemy into feed him I don't feel good I'm like

1294
00:55:46,943 --> 00:55:49,247

A dirty car just described Lysol

00:57:02,719 --> 00:57:03,487
Dirty carpets

1324
00:57:04,511 --> 00:57:05,023

Nobody

1333
00:57:32,927 --> 00:57:33,439
But think about

1334
00:57:33,695 --> 00:57:34,463
Paramedics

1335
00:57:36,255 --> 00:57:40,095
Show up and see these chewed-up bodies

1336
00:57:40,351 --> 00:57:41,887
Are you drive by

1337
00:57:42,399 --> 00:57:44,959
The firefighters and police were there with dead

1338
00:57:45,215 --> 00:57:45,983
Kids and stuff

1339
00:57:50,591 --> 00:57:51,103
The first

1340
00:57:51,615 --> 00:57:53,919
Pull up a record

1341
00:57:54,431 --> 00:57:56,735
A mommy you're trying to

1342
00:57:57,503 --> 00:57:58,015
And and

1343
00:57:58,783 --> 00:57:59,807
Baby.

1344
00:58:00,319 --> 00:58:03,135
That's not my fault

1345
00:58:03,903 --> 00:58:06,207
I got there I tried to hold it around their neck I try to put a

1346
00:58:07,231 --> 00:58:07,743
Lil Baby

1347
00:58:08,511 --> 00:58:09,023
It's a psycho

1348
00:58:09,279 --> 00:58:09,791
Wound

1349
00:58:11,583 --> 00:58:14,655
There's everybody else just wants to go home and watch Netflix

1350
00:58:15,423 --> 00:58:17,471
And and you know here's some stuff from

1351
00:58:17,727 --> 00:58:19,775
Jeff Bezos black lives matter

1352
00:58:20,799 --> 00:58:21,823
Cops and you just like

1353
00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:23,615
It doesn't even fit

1354
00:58:24,383 --> 00:58:27,455
You got these billionaires up there

1355
00:58:28,223 --> 00:58:29,247
By the way

1356
00:58:30,527 --> 00:58:32,575
How much

1357
00:58:32,831 --> 00:58:34,111
Dude make a hundred thousand dollars

1358
00:58:35,135 --> 00:58:36,671
Man

1359
00:58:38,975 --> 00:58:42,047
So that's what it's like to listen to the show a lot of the time

1360
00:58:42,303 --> 00:58:44,351
It was that bewildering okay

1361
00:58:44,607 --> 00:58:46,655
I really do not know

1362
00:58:46,911 --> 00:58:49,215
Exactly what point he's making although I will say

1363
00:58:49,471 --> 00:58:50,751
Bourget to urinalysis

1364
00:58:51,775 --> 00:58:52,799
I do think

1365
00:58:53,055 --> 00:58:56,127
I realize what he's trying to comply with carpet

1366
00:58:56,639 --> 00:58:59,199
I didn't understand it for I think

1367
00:58:59,455 --> 00:59:00,479
He's implying that you

1368
00:59:00,735 --> 00:59:03,295
Cleaned up like Satanic rituals or something like that

1369
00:59:03,551 --> 00:59:06,367
I think it has to be because otherwise yes it's a dirty carpet

1370
00:59:06,623 --> 00:59:08,415
You're going to see a dirty house

1371
00:59:08,671 --> 00:59:13,535
I'm someone who can't afford a carpet cleaning company or maybe he's saying that he

1372
00:59:14,047 --> 00:59:17,887
He cleaned up murder scenes or something like that he had a contract with the city

1373
00:59:18,143 --> 00:59:19,935
Company did or something like that

1374
00:59:20,191 --> 00:59:20,959
But if you saying

1375
00:59:21,215 --> 00:59:23,007
He cleaned up after Satanic rituals then

1376
00:59:23,263 --> 00:59:24,287
What he did

1377
00:59:24,543 --> 00:59:26,335
I is not report them

1378
00:59:26,847 --> 00:59:27,615
So he's complicit

1379
00:59:27,871 --> 00:59:32,479
Anyway I have no idea what he's talking about just has PTSD from cleaning a lot of carpet

1380
00:59:32,735 --> 00:59:34,271
I think that's the I think that

1381
00:59:34,527 --> 00:59:35,295
That's basically what he's

1382
00:59:35,551 --> 00:59:38,879
Describe because here's erie's going through it right now

1383
00:59:39,135 --> 00:59:40,671
The path you went off

1384
00:59:40,927 --> 00:59:42,975
So he's got apathy

1385
00:59:43,487 --> 00:59:45,791
He's not a sociopath he is

1386
00:59:46,047 --> 00:59:52,191
Being nice and being with good people as how you build a good society and he doesn't like it whenever he has to smoke food

1387
00:59:52,959 --> 00:59:59,103
Right that's why hasn't he doesn't feel good cuz they're so weak

1388
00:59:59,359 --> 01:00:02,687
And being weak reminds him of

1389
01:00:03,199 --> 01:00:04,479
Being a carpet cleaner

1390
01:00:04,735 --> 01:00:07,551
Which is the same as being a paramedic or a first responder

1391
01:00:07,807 --> 01:00:08,319
And

1392
01:00:08,575 --> 01:00:12,927
He said multiple times that he doesn't care what race you are which means he's talking about black

1393
01:00:13,183 --> 01:00:15,487
People maybe and

1394
01:00:16,767 --> 01:00:17,279
Poor

1395
01:00:18,047 --> 01:00:18,815
Memes

1396
01:00:19,327 --> 01:00:19,839
Carpet

1397
01:00:20,607 --> 01:00:22,399
SD dirty carpet

1398
01:00:22,655 --> 01:00:23,679
Takes us to the cops

1399
01:00:24,191 --> 01:00:30,335
Paramedic car crash and black

1400
01:00:30,591 --> 01:00:32,895
Clyde's matter is killing baby

1401
01:00:33,407 --> 01:00:36,479
Forgot about the Billionaire's hummingbird

1402
01:00:36,735 --> 01:00:40,575
Black lives matter SS

1403
01:00:41,343 --> 01:00:43,903
See this is the experience that I go through some

1404
01:00:44,159 --> 01:00:47,487
Sometimes like sometimes I'm able to sit here at present you with clips

1405
01:00:47,743 --> 01:00:51,071
That makes sense so you like talking about years the b*******

1406
01:00:51,327 --> 01:00:52,351
With the

1407
01:00:52,607 --> 01:00:54,655
The clip about like it's come out and Courtney's downloads

1408
01:00:54,911 --> 01:00:56,191
Speeds for the goose for hacked like

1409
01:00:56,447 --> 01:00:58,495
I can tell you what he's talkin about

1410
01:00:58,751 --> 01:01:03,615
That I forgot the Bible is true Bibles

1411
01:01:03,871 --> 01:01:05,151
Cleaning the Bible History

1412
01:01:05,663 --> 01:01:11,807
That's what leads me to believe that he's talking about cleaning up like Satanic rituals connection

1413
01:01:12,063 --> 01:01:13,599
Bible being real is very strange

1414
01:01:14,111 --> 01:01:17,439
I refuse to accept there's a real connection to any of those

1415
01:01:17,951 --> 01:01:22,047
So whatever bewilderment you were feeling or the audience was arguing while list

1416
01:01:22,303 --> 01:01:24,607
Something to that rambling nonsense

1417
01:01:24,863 --> 01:01:26,399
PTSD from it now

1418
01:01:27,423 --> 01:01:30,239
Try to imagine my life

1419
01:01:31,519 --> 01:01:35,871
What are you talkin about then

1420
01:01:36,127 --> 01:01:42,271
Imagine people who are listening to this show who believe him love it and not being like I'm worried about this guy

1421
01:01:42,527 --> 01:01:46,367
How smart this guy is

1422
01:01:47,647 --> 01:01:49,695
So Alex Goes break and he comes back

1423
01:01:49,951 --> 01:01:51,999
And he starts talking about a recent

1424
01:01:52,255 --> 01:01:53,023
Crime that was

1425
01:01:53,279 --> 01:01:55,071
Committed and he's

1426
01:01:55,327 --> 01:01:55,839
Being really dumb

1427
01:01:56,095 --> 01:02:02,239
Drama queens

1428
01:02:02,495 --> 01:02:07,871
Imagine put 2 years ago you saw Charles

1429
01:02:08,127 --> 01:02:09,919
Spell where.

1430
01:02:12,991 --> 01:02:14,783
It's a long tail out of that guy's

1431
01:02:17,087 --> 01:02:18,367
Harbor

1432
01:02:29,631 --> 01:02:31,679
You're saying it's all over run for the Hills

1433
01:02:32,447 --> 01:02:34,495
Survivors all the attack

1434
01:02:34,751 --> 01:02:35,263
Back pain

1435
01:02:36,287 --> 01:02:38,079
Borders that means America supporters

1436
01:02:39,615 --> 01:02:40,383
Bullying people that

1437
01:02:40,895 --> 01:02:41,407
Believing cell

1438
01:02:41,663 --> 01:02:42,943
Defensible leaving life

1439
01:02:43,199 --> 01:02:43,967
Show me reason

1440
01:02:44,735 --> 01:02:45,759
The people that want back

1441
01:02:46,015 --> 01:02:47,039
Down under intimidation

1442
01:02:47,295 --> 01:02:48,575
Those guys looking for

1443
01:02:53,439 --> 01:02:54,719
Of what

1444
01:02:54,975 --> 01:02:55,999
Dot-com from supporters attack

1445
01:02:57,535 --> 01:02:59,583
Plows through GOP voter

1446
01:02:59,839 --> 01:03:00,351
Registration

1447
01:03:00,607 --> 01:03:01,631
Content in Florida

1448
01:03:01,887 --> 01:03:02,399
Spectre

1449
01:03:02,655 --> 01:03:03,679
Just real quick

1450
01:03:03,935 --> 01:03:04,703
Heather hair didn't

1451
01:03:04,959 --> 01:03:05,471
Have a heart attack

1452
01:03:05,983 --> 01:03:07,263
What is a white nationalist

1453
01:03:07,519 --> 01:03:08,031
Meme talk

1454
01:03:08,287 --> 01:03:09,055
Pinpoint that spreads

1455
01:03:09,311 --> 01:03:11,615
Deflect blame from the guy who hit her with his car

1456
01:03:12,383 --> 01:03:17,247
The fact that Alex consistently brings that up isn't necessarily proof that he's intentionally running interference for whites

1457
01:03:17,503 --> 01:03:18,015
Supremacist

1458
01:03:18,271 --> 01:03:21,343
What is definitely Italian marker as to the source of information

1459
01:03:21,599 --> 01:03:22,367
Funny being credible

1460
01:03:22,879 --> 01:03:27,231
He has to be getting it through that channel

1461
01:03:27,487 --> 01:03:28,511
Repeating it or he

1462
01:03:28,767 --> 01:03:31,839
He just thinks that those people know what's up

1463
01:03:32,351 --> 01:03:36,447
27-year old man did run his car into a GOP voter registration

1464
01:03:36,703 --> 01:03:37,727
Attempt

1465
01:03:37,983 --> 01:03:40,031
Set up a meeting on Saturday

1466
01:03:40,287 --> 01:03:41,055
And that's awful

1467
01:03:41,823 --> 01:03:44,127
Even though these incidents may seem similar to Alex

1468
01:03:44,383 --> 01:03:45,919
In that they both involve cars

1469
01:03:46,431 --> 01:03:50,783
When their view together they actually demonstrate clearly why the national conversation happened

1470
01:03:51,039 --> 01:03:52,319
After the United right rally

1471
01:03:52,575 --> 01:03:54,879
And this one will not have the same effect

1472
01:03:55,647 --> 01:03:58,975
The first obvious thing is that the United right rally Heather hair with

1473
01:03:59,999 --> 01:04:01,023
Fatalities will always

1474
01:04:01,279 --> 01:04:02,815
Increase the severity of the situation

1475
01:04:03,327 --> 01:04:09,215
Conversely in the case of this guy in Florida no injuries or even reported which makes his actions stupid and wrong

1476
01:04:09,471 --> 01:04:12,031
But it's not a clear

1477
01:04:12,287 --> 01:04:14,079
Huge deal as if he'd murdered somebody

1478
01:04:15,103 --> 01:04:18,175
Second while it appears that the guy in Florida didn't like Trump supporters

1479
01:04:18,687 --> 01:04:23,039
Lieutenant Leary Gail of the Jacksonville Sheriff's Office said that quote we don't know what this is

1480
01:04:23,295 --> 01:04:24,063
Politically motivated

1481
01:04:24,575 --> 01:04:26,111
We're in Florida it could be

1482
01:04:26,879 --> 01:04:29,183
You can make the assumption that it's politically motivated

1483
01:04:29,439 --> 01:04:31,231
You're welcome to have that opinion

1484
01:04:31,487 --> 01:04:35,071
But the people investigating it don't know that yet so it remains to be seen

1485
01:04:36,095 --> 01:04:36,863
Conversely epi

1486
01:04:37,119 --> 01:04:39,679
Unite the right rally the political motives of the events

1487
01:04:39,935 --> 01:04:42,239
That led to the car attack were pretty well understood

1488
01:04:43,007 --> 01:04:44,287
I meant finally

1489
01:04:44,543 --> 01:04:45,311
Is very basic

1490
01:04:46,335 --> 01:04:49,919
Everyone knows that driving your car into people is wrong

1491
01:04:50,431 --> 01:04:51,199
The left and right

1492
01:04:51,455 --> 01:04:52,223
Agree on that

1493
01:04:53,759 --> 01:04:54,271
So what

1494
01:04:54,527 --> 01:04:56,319
I was particularly unsettling for people

1495
01:04:56,575 --> 01:05:00,159
About the United right rally was Trump's response to the Fallout of it

1496
01:05:00,671 --> 01:05:03,743
When he said that they were very fine people on both sides

1497
01:05:04,511 --> 01:05:06,303
To be fair to Trump he also said quote

1498
01:05:06,559 --> 01:05:10,911
I'm not talking about the neo-nazis and white nationalists because they should be condemned totally

1499
01:05:11,167 --> 01:05:15,519
But you had many people in that group other than white-naped neo-nazis and white

1500
01:05:16,031 --> 01:05:18,591
Okay and the Press is treated them absolutely unfairly

1501
01:05:19,359 --> 01:05:22,687
So what mean we finally have a president who recognized the inherent Beast

1502
01:05:22,943 --> 01:05:25,759
People who are willing to March alongside open white supremacist

1503
01:05:26,015 --> 01:05:26,783
The neo-nazis

1504
01:05:27,039 --> 01:05:28,831
So I don't know if that quote actually make

1505
01:05:29,087 --> 01:05:32,159
Why won't people think of the Guilty by sand

1506
01:05:32,927 --> 01:05:33,951
Why won't they think

1507
01:05:34,463 --> 01:05:38,047
Have Dad right about the bad people but don't

1508
01:05:38,303 --> 01:05:39,327
Don't you

1509
01:05:39,583 --> 01:05:42,399
Want to shed a tear for the people who just wanted

1510
01:05:42,655 --> 01:05:48,799
To oppress other people and had not been alongside open miona

1511
01:05:49,055 --> 01:05:52,127
But of course they were just pop out Face bookbag

1512
01:05:52,383 --> 01:05:55,199
Yeah yeah reacting

1513
01:05:55,711 --> 01:05:58,015
After the rally Trump tried to defend his side

1514
01:05:58,271 --> 01:06:00,575
Instead of respecting the woman had been killed

1515
01:06:00,831 --> 01:06:03,135
And that goddamn neo-nazis were marching alongside

1516
01:06:03,391 --> 01:06:04,927
His supporters and recognizing

1517
01:06:05,183 --> 01:06:09,791
The real problem there he decided to provide cover and defense for that which most people found shocking

1518
01:06:10,047 --> 01:06:11,071
Dang it really disgusting

1519
01:06:11,327 --> 01:06:12,607
Which they shouldn't have found Chucky

1520
01:06:13,375 --> 01:06:13,887
Is varidesk

1521
01:06:14,399 --> 01:06:17,727
Conversely in the case of this guy in Florida I'll reach you from the New York Post

1522
01:06:18,239 --> 01:06:21,055
Quote the Duval County Democratic party said it condemned

1523
01:06:21,311 --> 01:06:22,847
Quote this cowardly act of violence

1524
01:06:23,359 --> 01:06:24,639
No one's life should be placed

1525
01:06:24,895 --> 01:06:26,687
Danger for exercising their First Amendment right

1526
01:06:27,199 --> 01:06:32,575
As Democrats but more importantly residents of the greater city of Jacksonville we call on our fellow citizen

1527
01:06:32,831 --> 01:06:34,111
To act with dignity civility

1528
01:06:34,367 --> 01:06:35,903
Respect for one another during this election

1529
01:06:36,159 --> 01:06:39,999
Cycle & Beyond look at how similar their rhetoric is to Trump

1530
01:06:40,255 --> 01:06:45,631
Of course you have to condemn them roundly the Safeway on the left I have to be ideologic

1531
01:06:45,887 --> 01:06:46,399
Inconsistent

1532
01:06:46,655 --> 01:06:48,191
And say that their rhetoric is

1533
01:06:48,447 --> 01:06:52,543
Inflammatory is absolutely going to get more people hurt

1534
01:06:53,055 --> 01:06:57,151
There wasn't a defense of this guy's actions no call to consider will hate you know Trump

1535
01:06:57,407 --> 01:07:00,991
Policies are pretty shity in the supporters are defending the guy was hurting a lot of people

1536
01:07:01,247 --> 01:07:03,807
There wasn't an attempt to justify a clearly wrong

1537
01:07:04,063 --> 01:07:05,087
React by deflecting

1538
01:07:05,343 --> 01:07:06,111
Which is the right thing

1539
01:07:06,367 --> 01:07:06,879
To do

1540
01:07:07,135 --> 01:07:11,231
This guy's actions are not indicative of the democratic party they are just his bad actions

1541
01:07:11,743 --> 01:07:16,351
The actions of white supremacist terrorists would not be associated with Trump if he behaved differ

1542
01:07:16,863 --> 01:07:18,143
I think crucial situation

1543
01:07:18,655 --> 01:07:21,215
Like the press conference after the United right rally

1544
01:07:21,983 --> 01:07:23,263
Because we all agree that running

1545
01:07:23,519 --> 01:07:26,335
Your car into people is wrong and in this case no one is trying to

1546
01:07:26,591 --> 01:07:27,615
Pretend that the conversation

1547
01:07:27,871 --> 01:07:29,919
News about anything other than that

1548
01:07:30,175 --> 01:07:32,735
Get to move forward after the agreement he's been arrested

1549
01:07:32,991 --> 01:07:34,527
You will be treated as

1550
01:07:34,783 --> 01:07:35,807
Appropriate by the law

1551
01:07:36,063 --> 01:07:36,831
There's no need to

1552
01:07:37,087 --> 01:07:40,927
To ask what the f*** is wrong with people trying to justify unjustifiable thing

1553
01:07:41,439 --> 01:07:42,719
And this is largely why this is

1554
01:07:42,975 --> 01:07:45,023
Is just a bad thing that happened in Florida

1555
01:07:45,279 --> 01:07:48,095
But even people like Alex will probably not remember in a week

1556
01:07:48,351 --> 01:07:51,423
Supposed to deeply traumatic event that ripples of which are still resume

1557
01:07:51,935 --> 01:07:52,447
To this day

1558
01:07:52,959 --> 01:07:53,727
These are thick

1559
01:07:54,239 --> 01:07:54,751
There's

1560
01:07:55,519 --> 01:07:56,031
It's so

1561
01:07:56,287 --> 01:07:57,311
F*** it obvious

1562
01:07:58,335 --> 01:07:58,847
Alex Mead

1563
01:07:59,103 --> 01:07:59,871
Touba ramp-up

1564
01:08:00,383 --> 01:08:01,919
Conservative victimhood juice

1565
01:08:02,431 --> 01:08:02,943
That's so in

1566
01:08:03,199 --> 01:08:04,991
Important toward to animating

1567
01:08:05,247 --> 01:08:07,551
The the rhetoric and the narratives that he put

1568
01:08:07,807 --> 01:08:09,343
It's worth on a shield

1569
01:08:09,599 --> 01:08:10,111
It runs this

1570
01:08:10,367 --> 01:08:10,879
This engine

1571
01:08:11,135 --> 01:08:11,903
What's what's

1572
01:08:12,159 --> 01:08:13,183
Disgusting to me about

1573
01:08:14,463 --> 01:08:18,303
It feels so often like when some kind of tragedy happens

1574
01:08:18,815 --> 01:08:19,839
Due to a

1575
01:08:20,095 --> 01:08:20,607
White National

1576
01:08:20,863 --> 01:08:21,375
Was terror attack

1577
01:08:22,399 --> 01:08:23,423
The right is not

1578
01:08:23,679 --> 01:08:25,727
At all interested engaging with that

1579
01:08:26,751 --> 01:08:28,031
They're just excited

1580
01:08:28,543 --> 01:08:31,871
Hoping that there will be a what about either later or

1581
01:08:32,127 --> 01:08:32,895
That they can point to

1582
01:08:33,407 --> 01:08:36,223
They wanted what about more than they want a resolution to

1583
01:08:37,503 --> 01:08:38,015
Sure

1584
01:08:38,527 --> 01:08:39,039
Yeah

1585
01:08:39,295 --> 01:08:39,807
But

1586
01:08:40,063 --> 01:08:40,575
It's all

1587
01:08:40,831 --> 01:08:41,855
Tustin service of

1588
01:08:42,111 --> 01:08:43,647
We are the ones who are under attack

1589
01:08:43,903 --> 01:08:45,695
Until you see that here with Alec

1590
01:08:46,207 --> 01:08:47,231
Like really just lying

1591
01:08:47,487 --> 01:08:49,535
DC reports every couple hours like

1592
01:08:53,375 --> 01:08:54,399
Headed boss

1593
01:08:54,655 --> 01:08:55,423
Biblia Beach

1594
01:08:55,679 --> 01:08:57,471
Boss to death in head with hammer

1595
01:09:03,871 --> 01:09:05,407
You just see the reports

1596
01:09:05,919 --> 01:09:06,687
Pouring out

1597
01:09:07,455 --> 01:09:08,479
And the media says

1598
01:09:10,271 --> 01:09:12,319
So there's a story in late January

1599
01:09:12,575 --> 01:09:16,671
Construction worker in Florida who is accused of murdering his boss who love Trump but he didn't use a ham

1600
01:09:16,927 --> 01:09:17,695
Use a trowel

1601
01:09:18,463 --> 01:09:21,535
Apparently the two men got into a political argument and then the dude killed

1602
01:09:21,791 --> 01:09:23,583
Was boss before draping American flag on

1603
01:09:24,607 --> 01:09:26,911
The problem here is that Alex heaters at this

1604
01:09:27,167 --> 01:09:29,727
Guy killed his Trump loving boss after a political argument

1605
01:09:29,983 --> 01:09:32,543
And he just assumes that the murderer is a Democrat who hates Trump

1606
01:09:33,311 --> 01:09:36,127
In reality the alleged murderer is one of those anti-government

1607
01:09:36,383 --> 01:09:37,919
Types of believe that the government is out to

1608
01:09:38,175 --> 01:09:41,759
Forget him kind of paranoid conspiracy theory type fella

1609
01:09:43,039 --> 01:09:45,343
Hey why Alex yours imagine those guys committing NEX

1610
01:09:46,367 --> 01:09:51,999
Alex is here saying that there's no there's all these new stories about attacks on Trump supporters are coming in every hour

1611
01:09:53,279 --> 01:09:56,863
Best you can do is come up with a story from over two weeks ago that he doesn't really know any of the

1612
01:09:57,119 --> 01:09:57,887
The details of

1613
01:09:58,399 --> 01:10:01,215
It may not make the Casey thinks he does and you can hear those long pauses

1614
01:10:01,471 --> 01:10:03,007
Cuz cuz he can't come up with anything

1615
01:10:03,263 --> 01:10:07,359
You should probably have a couple of examples

1616
01:10:07,615 --> 01:10:10,175
Bridal got out of your head two-week-old storiesig

1617
01:10:10,431 --> 01:10:13,759
Probably isn't what you think it is maybe even just give the one that came in

1618
01:10:14,015 --> 01:10:14,527
Last hour

1619
01:10:14,783 --> 01:10:15,295
The most

1620
01:10:15,551 --> 01:10:19,903
10 hours a day

1621
01:10:20,159 --> 01:10:21,951
Clearly have a handle on this stuff

1622
01:10:22,207 --> 01:10:22,975
What about the one that

1623
01:10:23,231 --> 01:10:24,767
Came in before you started the show

1624
01:10:25,023 --> 01:10:25,791
While you were on there

1625
01:10:26,047 --> 01:10:28,863
But then you know that the issue is that like all these

1626
01:10:29,375 --> 01:10:30,399
Some supporters are getting attacked

1627
01:10:30,655 --> 01:10:32,447
Every hour you hear the news stories

1628
01:10:32,703 --> 01:10:33,215
Corydon

1629
01:10:33,471 --> 01:10:33,983
Billings

1630
01:10:34,495 --> 01:10:35,263
In Demon

1631
01:10:35,775 --> 01:10:36,543
In the media

1632
01:10:37,055 --> 01:10:38,591
Like Wolf Blitzer justify

1633
01:10:39,103 --> 01:10:41,919
I watch 10 years ago

1634
01:10:42,431 --> 01:10:43,711
Cars with Phylicia Rashad

1635
01:10:44,991 --> 01:10:47,039
Latta Gaston say he's a hero

1636
01:10:47,551 --> 01:10:49,087
Not a bad guy he soft

1637
01:10:49,343 --> 01:10:51,391
Fascism

1638
01:10:52,671 --> 01:10:54,207
Hoping more people

1639
01:10:54,719 --> 01:10:55,743
Would come kill

1640
01:10:55,999 --> 01:10:57,791
Trump supporting members of Congress

1641
01:10:59,583 --> 01:11:00,607
If you're ever successful

1642
01:11:01,119 --> 01:11:02,655
Civil War

1643
01:11:03,935 --> 01:11:06,239
It's open season on your little ass

1644
01:11:06,751 --> 01:11:09,055
So on The Situation Room on June

1645
01:11:09,311 --> 01:11:11,615
14th 2017 while reporting on the shooting at

1646
01:11:11,871 --> 01:11:13,151
At the Congressional baseball practice

1647
01:11:13,407 --> 01:11:16,223
Wolf Blitzer played a piece that was compiled by CNN

1648
01:11:16,479 --> 01:11:18,271
Congressional correspondent Phil Mattingly

1649
01:11:19,039 --> 01:11:22,623
Approximately 7 Seconds of the piece was an acquaintance of the shooter saying quote

1650
01:11:22,879 --> 01:11:24,927
I just want to let people know that he wasn't

1651
01:11:25,183 --> 01:11:28,511
Evil that he was I guess tired of some of the politics that are going on

1652
01:11:29,023 --> 01:11:34,143
Wolf didn't say that it was good and in fact after Mattingly finished up his presentation of his peace

1653
01:11:34,399 --> 01:11:35,167
Here's what wolf

1654
01:11:35,423 --> 01:11:36,191
Actually said

1655
01:11:36,447 --> 01:11:39,007
You know if it is clearly he was evil

1656
01:11:39,263 --> 01:11:40,543
March 22nd

1657
01:11:40,799 --> 01:11:43,359
Are you point out he posted this on Facebook

1658
01:11:43,615 --> 01:11:47,967
Trump is a traitor Trump has destroyed our democracy it's time to destroy

1659
01:11:48,223 --> 01:11:50,527
Trump and Company and then he said

1660
01:11:50,783 --> 01:11:52,831
Republicans are the Taliban

1661
01:11:53,087 --> 01:11:54,879
Of the USA when you say

1662
01:11:55,135 --> 01:12:01,279
On a Facebook post it's time to destroy Trump and Company that's a threat against the president of the United

1663
01:12:01,535 --> 01:12:03,071
And that's a crime

1664
01:12:03,583 --> 01:12:05,887
Not only did Wolf not support the shooters Act

1665
01:12:06,143 --> 01:12:09,215
You directly and clearly rejected the state that the equator

1666
01:12:09,471 --> 01:12:11,007
Made sings the shooter wasn't

1667
01:12:11,263 --> 01:12:11,775
Evil

1668
01:12:12,031 --> 01:12:15,871
Kind of seems like Alex just makes up whatever he wants in order to satisfy the right wing

1669
01:12:16,127 --> 01:12:17,151
Constant need

1670
01:12:17,407 --> 01:12:18,687
To portray themselves as victims

1671
01:12:18,943 --> 01:12:23,039
What a piece of s*** also it's also just so it doesn't matter

1672
01:12:23,551 --> 01:12:24,319
It doesn't matter if

1673
01:12:24,575 --> 01:12:29,951
It's reality or not. What they want to say that's why anytime somebody is trying to be like

1674
01:12:30,207 --> 01:12:33,279
Oh nobody would vote for Bernie because they'll call him a socialist

1675
01:12:34,303 --> 01:12:34,815
Do diff

1676
01:12:35,071 --> 01:12:36,607
Pitas in they're going to call him a so

1677
01:12:37,375 --> 01:12:39,423
It does not matter what reality is

1678
01:12:39,679 --> 01:12:40,447
What matters with

1679
01:12:40,703 --> 01:12:41,215
Politically

1680
01:12:41,983 --> 01:12:43,263
Right and I'll admit it's just

1681
01:12:43,775 --> 01:12:44,287
This is blade

1682
01:12:44,543 --> 01:12:45,823
Terrible

1683
01:12:46,079 --> 01:12:48,127
So blame this on the 311

1684
01:12:48,383 --> 01:12:50,431
About this is probably just the Alex

1685
01:12:50,687 --> 01:12:51,455
The head is

1686
01:12:51,711 --> 01:12:57,855
You got he got high by contact with the 311

1687
01:12:58,111 --> 01:12:59,647
Terrible job

1688
01:12:59,903 --> 01:13:01,183
Anyway he's like a wolf

1689
01:13:01,439 --> 01:13:03,999
Luther open season on you when they when the war comes

1690
01:13:05,023 --> 01:13:08,863
And Alex gets to rambling about fantasies if I wanted to kill Wolf Blitzer

1691
01:13:09,119 --> 01:13:12,703
Now hold on one second can I go back here he has empathy

1692
01:13:13,215 --> 01:13:19,359
And it would be crazy to Brian is enemy doesn't like it he doesn't like it she Opeth or recycle

1693
01:13:19,615 --> 01:13:20,895
I don't know if he actually likes

1694
01:13:21,151 --> 01:13:23,199
The frying of the enemies but he certainly likes

1695
01:13:23,455 --> 01:13:24,735
Talking about it

1696
01:13:25,247 --> 01:13:27,295
In the past Jordan we have said that Alex

1697
01:13:27,551 --> 01:13:28,319
Probably text

1698
01:13:28,575 --> 01:13:29,087
Technically killed a guy

1699
01:13:29,855 --> 01:13:31,391
I think we can now upgrades

1700
01:13:31,903 --> 01:13:34,719
I don't want to ever see Wolf Blitzer

1701
01:13:34,975 --> 01:13:35,487
Because

1702
01:13:39,327 --> 01:13:39,839
I mean

1703
01:13:40,607 --> 01:13:42,911
Like you really want to start a fight with us

1704
01:13:45,471 --> 01:13:46,751
Don't you

1705
01:13:47,263 --> 01:13:48,287
You're begging for it

1706
01:13:49,311 --> 01:13:50,335
You're begging

1707
01:13:50,591 --> 01:13:53,151
You're begging to get your gut stomped out our

1708
01:13:54,431 --> 01:13:56,735
Aerowolf you ever had your gut stomped out

1709
01:13:56,991 --> 01:13:57,503
But you don't

1710
01:13:57,759 --> 01:13:59,295
Live after that happens

1711
01:14:04,159 --> 01:14:06,207
Actually I'm a couple times not too nice

1712
01:14:06,975 --> 01:14:10,047
Text people long time to die if you start their guts out that but

1713
01:14:11,327 --> 01:14:13,119
That's no threat to Will bletzer

1714
01:14:13,375 --> 01:14:17,471
So Alex is a mass murderer

1715
01:14:17,727 --> 01:14:20,287
You just admitted to murder

1716
01:14:20,543 --> 01:14:25,663
No set multiple murders murder we multiple murders

1717
01:14:25,919 --> 01:14:31,551
Check the Dallas unbelievable

1718
01:14:32,063 --> 01:14:38,207
Yeah let's go Cold Case Files on Alex Jones only a hundred percent don't believe Alex

1719
01:14:40,255 --> 01:14:42,815
Take some of his words

1720
01:14:43,071 --> 01:14:44,607
He is a

1721
01:14:44,863 --> 01:14:47,935
Multiple murderer multiple murderer

1722
01:14:48,191 --> 01:14:48,703
New tech

1723
01:14:48,959 --> 01:14:55,103
We probably anymore Alex you are a murderer at the very least murder 2

1724
01:14:55,359 --> 01:14:56,895
Police Murder to baby wasn't

1725
01:14:57,151 --> 01:14:58,943
Premeditated baby just got angry

1726
01:14:59,199 --> 01:15:02,271
But man I would give him 25 to Life on this you know what

1727
01:15:02,527 --> 01:15:08,671
Really f***** up about that clip is like in the past whenever he's talked about like these probable technical birders

1728
01:15:08,927 --> 01:15:09,439
These committed

1729
01:15:09,951 --> 01:15:10,463
I always am.

1730
01:15:10,719 --> 01:15:11,231
Contacts.

1731
01:15:11,743 --> 01:15:16,095
You know hey I didn't like to do it I was gas bullied and I you know it's like almost self-defense

1732
01:15:16,351 --> 01:15:17,119
Nature

1733
01:15:17,375 --> 01:15:18,655
This is not this is

1734
01:15:19,167 --> 01:15:22,495
Cinderella seeing the slowness of their death yeah

1735
01:15:22,751 --> 01:15:23,519
This is absurd

1736
01:15:23,775 --> 01:15:24,287
Sick f***

1737
01:15:24,543 --> 01:15:25,823
Talk radio

1738
01:15:26,079 --> 01:15:32,223
Said he doesn't enjoy his enemies but he doesn't

1739
01:15:32,479 --> 01:15:33,247
Watching their guts

1740
01:15:33,503 --> 01:15:34,783
Spell out and blowing

1741
01:15:35,295 --> 01:15:36,063
Slowly painful

1742
01:15:36,319 --> 01:15:38,879
Right right right he's not a sociopath and a psychopath

1743
01:15:39,391 --> 01:15:42,207
That would be crazy that I really need to put a sharp Focus

1744
01:15:42,463 --> 01:15:45,279
Song here is that like if he's telling the truth

1745
01:15:45,535 --> 01:15:46,815
Is the most f*****-up thing ever

1746
01:15:47,071 --> 01:15:47,583
But

1747
01:15:47,839 --> 01:15:53,983
If he's lying it's even more f***** up

1748
01:15:55,007 --> 01:15:57,055
Seen by his audience as someone

1749
01:15:57,311 --> 01:15:58,335
Who would have

1750
01:15:58,847 --> 01:16:03,455
Slowly and painfully murdered multiple people

1751
01:16:03,711 --> 01:16:09,087
Seems okay or positive today which is really gross

1752
01:16:09,343 --> 01:16:10,111
Sick look

1753
01:16:10,367 --> 01:16:14,719
It's a stand your ground law even if the ground is below a human's body

1754
01:16:14,975 --> 01:16:17,279
You still get to stand on that ground I believe

1755
01:16:17,791 --> 01:16:19,071
Engrossed

1756
01:16:19,583 --> 01:16:20,095
Child

1757
01:16:20,863 --> 01:16:23,423
Sunnyway brambles a bit about CNN

1758
01:16:23,679 --> 01:16:26,239
Because you know Wolf Blitzer got to throw some shots of him

1759
01:16:26,495 --> 01:16:27,263
And then

1760
01:16:27,775 --> 01:16:28,799
You know he's not the only one

1761
01:16:29,055 --> 01:16:30,335
I'm going to get it

1762
01:16:30,591 --> 01:16:32,639
A lot of people are going to be Friday

1763
01:16:32,895 --> 01:16:36,223
And if you forget about God's they're not Gods anymore but Anderson

1764
01:16:39,807 --> 01:16:40,319
Just because

1765
01:16:40,575 --> 01:16:41,087
Cuz you're the

1766
01:16:41,343 --> 01:16:42,111
Last

1767
01:16:43,135 --> 01:16:44,671
Vanderbilt Planetarium

1768
01:16:50,303 --> 01:16:52,095
Is your brother wouldn't bend over

1769
01:16:54,399 --> 01:16:54,911
What

1770
01:16:58,239 --> 01:17:00,287
You're not going to g******** America

1771
01:17:01,311 --> 01:17:02,079
By yourself

1772
01:17:02,591 --> 01:17:05,663
So after getting mad Wolf Blitzer Alex descends into a rant

1773
01:17:05,919 --> 01:17:08,479
Just generally that's the end being bad and it's pretty boring

1774
01:17:08,735 --> 01:17:09,247
Formulaic

1775
01:17:09,759 --> 01:17:14,879
I decided to cut this clip though cuz it really illustrates our Alex are just making up the bulshit he says in his ramblings

1776
01:17:15,647 --> 01:17:20,255
41 in 1988 Anderson Cooper's brother Carter committed suicide by jumping out of the way

1777
01:17:21,023 --> 01:17:22,303
This is absolutely tragic

1778
01:17:22,559 --> 01:17:24,351
And their mother believes that this was the result of us

1779
01:17:24,607 --> 01:17:26,399
Psychotic episode caused by bad drug

1780
01:17:26,911 --> 01:17:28,191
Action but Alex is rewriting it

1781
01:17:28,703 --> 01:17:29,215
Is a f******

1782
01:17:29,471 --> 01:17:29,983
Gross thing

1783
01:17:30,239 --> 01:17:30,751
Thing to do

1784
01:17:31,263 --> 01:17:34,079
Regardless Anderson Cooper does not just have one sibling

1785
01:17:35,103 --> 01:17:37,407
Sure maybe his only brother from that marriage

1786
01:17:37,919 --> 01:17:39,967
Is that marriage of his mother's and Carter

1787
01:17:40,223 --> 01:17:44,831
But their father Wyatt Emory Cooper is not where the Vanderbilt limited lineage comes from

1788
01:17:45,343 --> 01:17:48,927
That's from his mother's side and Gloria Vanderbilt already had two sons

1789
01:17:49,183 --> 01:17:50,207
When she married Cooper

1790
01:17:50,719 --> 01:17:51,743
And they're both still alive

1791
01:17:51,999 --> 01:17:55,327
Ipso facto Anderson Cooper is not the last Vanderbilt

1792
01:17:56,095 --> 01:17:57,375
And that's not even considering

1793
01:17:57,631 --> 01:17:59,679
The Gloria Vanderbilt had a sister

1794
01:17:59,935 --> 01:18:00,959
Kathleen Vanderbilt

1795
01:18:01,215 --> 01:18:04,543
Or the fact that Cornelius Vanderbilt was their

1796
01:18:04,799 --> 01:18:05,823
Father and he had 30

1797
01:18:06,335 --> 01:18:06,847
Children

1798
01:18:07,359 --> 01:18:08,639
The family is very diffuse

1799
01:18:09,151 --> 01:18:10,943
There are a ton of living Vanderbilt

1800
01:18:11,199 --> 01:18:11,967
Like guess who

1801
01:18:12,479 --> 01:18:13,503
Timothy Olyphant

1802
01:18:13,759 --> 01:18:19,903
Who is Anderson Cooper's third cousin once removed

1803
01:18:20,159 --> 01:18:26,303
I didn't know that just because he's being sneaky with a different last name

1804
01:18:26,559 --> 01:18:28,351
Timothy Vanderbilt to be in my way

1805
01:18:28,863 --> 01:18:30,655
Treadmill the fact get them in there

1806
01:18:31,167 --> 01:18:33,215
But what about James and Vanderbilt

1807
01:18:33,727 --> 01:18:39,871
The guy who wrote the movie Zodiac The Amazing Spider-Man in White House Down dude also wrote the mega twitches

1808
01:18:40,895 --> 01:18:41,919
Fighting a shark

1809
01:18:42,431 --> 01:18:46,271
There are tons of other Vanderbilt or still alive you just don't know about it

1810
01:18:46,527 --> 01:18:47,551
Because it doesn't mean

1811
01:18:48,319 --> 01:18:52,927
Anymore is predictive programming do Jason Statham will have to fight a shark Revenge

1812
01:18:53,183 --> 01:18:57,791
Alex is making up that Anderson Cooper is the last Vanderbilt to make him seem like more of a villain

1813
01:18:58,303 --> 01:19:00,863
And has an opportunity to mock him for his brother's death

1814
01:19:01,119 --> 01:19:01,887
Because Alex is a

1815
01:19:02,143 --> 01:19:03,167
Profoundly bad person

1816
01:19:03,679 --> 01:19:08,287
And also it turns out he probably killed a lot of people sociopath

1817
01:19:08,543 --> 01:19:10,335
Mr. worst he is a f****** months

1818
01:19:11,615 --> 01:19:15,455
But this is my educational corner while I wear I teach the world that

1819
01:19:15,711 --> 01:19:16,223
Timothy Olyphant

1820
01:19:16,735 --> 01:19:19,551
Related to the Vanderbilt family that is a nice little fun fact

1821
01:19:20,831 --> 01:19:22,367
So Alex goes out to break any

1822
01:19:22,879 --> 01:19:24,671
Comes back in he's got tagged wants to

1823
01:19:24,927 --> 01:19:26,975
To touch on the the Rodger Stone news

1824
01:19:27,231 --> 01:19:28,511
How I imagined he would

1825
01:19:29,791 --> 01:19:31,327
Sound of your calls until the very end

1826
01:19:33,119 --> 01:19:34,399
I've got to get this Rodger Stone thing

1827
01:19:35,167 --> 01:19:35,935
Maybe I should just

1828
01:19:36,959 --> 01:19:39,007
Weak Sean marylebone a.m.

1829
01:19:39,775 --> 01:19:42,591
It's all over the news that well Rodger has to go to print

1830
01:19:42,847 --> 01:19:44,127
Cousin for a long time

1831
01:19:44,639 --> 01:19:47,455
Cuz he violated a gag order talk about Alex Jones

1832
01:19:48,479 --> 01:19:48,991
Really

1833
01:19:49,759 --> 01:19:51,039
Three Links about the truck

1834
01:19:51,807 --> 01:19:53,087
You're that much of a narcissist

1835
01:19:53,855 --> 01:19:55,647
Rodger said a news articles

1836
01:19:57,951 --> 01:19:58,463
That

1837
01:20:01,791 --> 01:20:04,095
He wanted a pardon from from he was convicted

1838
01:20:04,351 --> 01:20:04,863
That's right

1839
01:20:08,959 --> 01:20:11,775
It's an American what this judge is doing it's insane

1840
01:20:12,287 --> 01:20:15,616
Rodger isn't going to prison cuz he's violated the gag order to talk to Alex

1841
01:20:15,872 --> 01:20:21,248
No more pathetic strawman attempts of zebra Malik lately seems like he doesn't have a good angle on this

1842
01:20:22,016 --> 01:20:23,040
Also I nudity

1843
01:20:23,296 --> 01:20:26,112
He's guilty that's the problem

1844
01:20:26,368 --> 01:20:29,952
Newsbroke the prosecutors are saying that Rodger should do between 7 to 9 years

1845
01:20:30,208 --> 01:20:31,744
In prison which means he'll be in like

1846
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,304
Free maybe that probably won't even

1847
01:20:34,816 --> 01:20:37,632
I've no faith in the system anymore he's not going to prison

1848
01:20:39,168 --> 01:20:41,216
Interesting l no consequences for his actions

1849
01:20:41,472 --> 01:20:43,008
This episode

1850
01:20:43,264 --> 01:20:45,568
Choose from Sunday the 9th of February

1851
01:20:46,080 --> 01:20:47,616
Alex didn't report the prosecutors

1852
01:20:47,872 --> 01:20:48,640
Request for sentencing

1853
01:20:48,896 --> 01:20:51,456
Until Monday afternoon

1854
01:20:51,712 --> 01:20:57,856
This heavily Blythe me that I was just getting this news from Rodger

1855
01:20:58,112 --> 01:20:59,648
Say that he's being sent to prison for defending

1856
01:20:59,904 --> 01:21:00,928
Himself or some s***

1857
01:21:01,184 --> 01:21:07,328
It's pretty sad but I'm not going to get too invested in it because like I said I have little faith that he's going to see the inside of a prison cell

1858
01:21:07,584 --> 01:21:11,168
For now this is just more that classic conservative victimhood narrative building

1859
01:21:11,936 --> 01:21:16,032
Just very very regular it is so annoying that the people who

1860
01:21:16,288 --> 01:21:17,568
Who f****** run everything

1861
01:21:17,824 --> 01:21:19,616
Sing now complain about being the

1862
01:21:19,872 --> 01:21:20,384
Subtotal at

1863
01:21:20,640 --> 01:21:21,152
So annoy

1864
01:21:21,664 --> 01:21:23,456
Yep and it's all because

1865
01:21:23,968 --> 01:21:24,992
Like a quarter man

1866
01:21:25,504 --> 01:21:27,552
But Alex has a defense for that which isn't good

1867
01:21:28,064 --> 01:21:29,088
Is the defense that he denies

1868
01:21:29,600 --> 01:21:30,112
Whatever he has

1869
01:21:30,368 --> 01:21:30,880
Have to go to court

1870
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:37,024
Bob Moyers about it

1871
01:21:37,536 --> 01:21:39,840
Plus I do common sense journalist

1872
01:21:40,352 --> 01:21:41,888
Only has her Little Dipper

1873
01:21:43,424 --> 01:21:45,984
What you doing everybody else is but she says

1874
01:21:47,776 --> 01:21:53,920
Alex is conveniently not a journalist whenever he's in a deposition setting

1875
01:21:54,176 --> 01:21:56,992
Journalist

1876
01:22:00,320 --> 01:22:02,368
The guts out of a multi people

1877
01:22:02,880 --> 01:22:08,512
So this guy at his job if he was just on Erica's being like a man

1878
01:22:08,768 --> 01:22:14,912
I love murder I don't like murdering people but when you do murder

1879
01:22:15,168 --> 01:22:16,448
Somebody ruined feel good

1880
01:22:16,960 --> 01:22:18,496
Have to watch him die slowly

1881
01:22:18,752 --> 01:22:23,104
So there's a hastily put-together commercial that Alex plays

1882
01:22:23,360 --> 01:22:25,664
Multiple times during the show

1883
01:22:25,920 --> 01:22:26,432
It's kind of Interest

1884
01:22:26,688 --> 01:22:27,968
Play a tiny piece

1885
01:22:28,480 --> 01:22:34,624
Confirm from a major Food suppliers across United States they already run out of supplies

1886
01:22:34,880 --> 01:22:41,024
Because of institutional and governmental buyers for the elites people razors or not

1887
01:22:41,280 --> 01:22:43,328
Shoe stores at alarming rates

1888
01:22:43,584 --> 01:22:46,144
I've been meaning to get into this for a while but I keep forgetting

1889
01:22:46,400 --> 01:22:47,424
What's a good time

1890
01:22:48,192 --> 01:22:51,520
The main driver of the sales pitch that Alex is going with you regarding the

1891
01:22:51,776 --> 01:22:53,056
Survival food from my picture

1892
01:22:53,312 --> 01:22:54,336
Supply is it bulk

1893
01:22:54,592 --> 01:22:56,384
Buyers are coming in and buying up all the

1894
01:22:56,640 --> 01:22:57,664
Survival food on the market

1895
01:22:57,920 --> 01:22:59,456
We need to act now to get your foods

1896
01:22:59,712 --> 01:23:00,992
Your family doesn't start otherwise

1897
01:23:01,248 --> 01:23:02,784
It's going to be an armored redoubt

1898
01:23:03,040 --> 01:23:03,552
It's pretty

1899
01:23:03,808 --> 01:23:05,088
Exploitative engross marketing

1900
01:23:05,344 --> 01:23:09,440
You scheme for what if I were to tell you Jordan that I've seen this exact same Market

1901
01:23:09,696 --> 01:23:10,208
Getting campaign

1902
01:23:10,464 --> 01:23:13,792
Before I do mean everywhere simultaneously right now

1903
01:23:14,304 --> 01:23:15,840
A while back we talked about this

1904
01:23:16,096 --> 01:23:18,912
Commercials that Alex used to run for the weird device

1905
01:23:19,424 --> 01:23:20,704
Which I think was a solar-powered thing

1906
01:23:21,216 --> 01:23:25,568
It was a cryptic commercial that warned of an impending collapse where you'd need this weird device

1907
01:23:25,824 --> 01:23:28,384
And the pitchman was a guy named Frank Bates

1908
01:23:28,896 --> 01:23:30,944
And this is a guy who's like a I'm a right way

1909
01:23:31,200 --> 01:23:34,016
I'm just like you a Middle America

1910
01:23:34,272 --> 01:23:39,136
Right as we discussed when we went over this prank Bates is a fake character designed to appeal to paranoid

1911
01:23:39,392 --> 01:23:40,160
Conservative radio list

1912
01:23:41,184 --> 01:23:42,976
He was the creation of an affiliate marketing

1913
01:23:43,232 --> 01:23:44,768
Scam artist named Allen Ballard

1914
01:23:45,024 --> 01:23:47,072
Who ran a company called reboot Market

1915
01:23:47,840 --> 01:23:51,680
Under the Umbrella of reboot marketing Balor had a ton of little smaller grip

1916
01:23:51,936 --> 01:23:53,216
Then one of them was food for

1917
01:23:54,752 --> 01:23:55,264
In 2013

1918
01:23:55,776 --> 01:23:57,824
Food4patriots was selling survival food

1919
01:23:58,080 --> 01:24:01,152
They wanted their customers that FEMA was trying to buy up all the food

1920
01:24:01,664 --> 01:24:03,968
Trying to skewer 420 million meals

1921
01:24:04,224 --> 01:24:05,504
The few people in their female

1922
01:24:06,784 --> 01:24:07,552
People's buying up

1923
01:24:07,808 --> 01:24:10,880
All the other available food but you could still get food from food for pate

1924
01:24:11,648 --> 01:24:12,928
Because unlike other companies

1925
01:24:13,184 --> 01:24:14,208
They weren't sellouts 2

1926
01:24:14,464 --> 01:24:14,976
To the man

1927
01:24:15,488 --> 01:24:17,280
This dude Alan Valor mayday

1928
01:24:17,536 --> 01:24:21,120
S*** ton of money playing on the fears of scared conservative audiences

1929
01:24:21,376 --> 01:24:22,144
Of people who'd been

1930
01:24:22,400 --> 01:24:23,168
Trained to think that

1931
01:24:23,424 --> 01:24:25,472
Any day Obama was going to put them in a FEMA camp

1932
01:24:25,984 --> 01:24:28,032
So in part thanks to the

1933
01:24:28,544 --> 01:24:29,568
Persona Frank B

1934
01:24:29,824 --> 01:24:31,616
Who's the guy just like that red-hot tip

1935
01:24:32,640 --> 01:24:34,432
Alex is doing the same thing now

1936
01:24:34,688 --> 01:24:38,016
And based on the fact that Alex used used to are weird device

1937
01:24:38,272 --> 01:24:38,784
Commercials

1938
01:24:39,040 --> 01:24:42,368
I wouldn't be surprised if he also advertised food4patriots

1939
01:24:43,392 --> 01:24:44,672
Except I'm certain that he did

1940
01:24:45,440 --> 01:24:47,488
Because food4patriots wasn't a real company

1941
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:53,376
It was just Alan Beeler reselling food from my Patriot Supply at a park up alright

1942
01:24:53,888 --> 01:24:56,192
Alright Evergreen

1943
01:24:56,704 --> 01:24:57,216
Etiquette scam

1944
01:24:57,728 --> 01:25:01,056
Because Alex has show and basically in the entirety of right-wing media is

1945
01:25:01,312 --> 01:25:03,616
Predicated on amplifying manufactured fear.

1946
01:25:03,872 --> 01:25:06,688
Distract from the very real problems that they're making worse

1947
01:25:06,944 --> 01:25:09,760
There will always be some sort of an issue to make profit

1948
01:25:10,528 --> 01:25:13,344
Sometimes it's a black president you're sure is going to lock you in a FEMA camp

1949
01:25:13,856 --> 01:25:15,392
Sometimes it's a Public Health crisis

1950
01:25:15,904 --> 01:25:21,024
But no matter the exact character of the thing you're supposed to be afraid of if you listen to Alex rest assured

1951
01:25:21,280 --> 01:25:22,304
It will be used

1952
01:25:22,560 --> 01:25:23,328
Visalia b*******

1953
01:25:23,840 --> 01:25:25,632
And my Patriot Supply is going to be there

1954
01:25:25,888 --> 01:25:26,400
Happily taken

1955
01:25:26,656 --> 01:25:27,168
Endicott

1956
01:25:27,424 --> 01:25:31,776
Alan Beeler was laughing his ass off and idiots who believe that Frank Bates was a real per

1957
01:25:32,544 --> 01:25:34,080
And you have to be a complete idiot.

1958
01:25:34,336 --> 01:25:34,848
Think that Alex

1959
01:25:35,104 --> 01:25:36,384
On some level laughing at

1960
01:25:36,640 --> 01:25:38,688
The people who think he's sincere to

1961
01:25:38,944 --> 01:25:39,456
Yep

1962
01:25:39,968 --> 01:25:40,480
That's

1963
01:25:41,248 --> 01:25:42,272
But why is it

1964
01:25:42,528 --> 01:25:44,064
So easy to get

1965
01:25:44,320 --> 01:25:45,856
These people to believe grifters

1966
01:25:46,112 --> 01:25:47,136
An impossible

1967
01:25:47,392 --> 01:25:48,928
To get them to believe grifters are gripped

1968
01:25:49,440 --> 01:25:51,488
Well because I think a lot of it is

1969
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:53,024
Really targeted at

1970
01:25:53,280 --> 01:25:59,424
Softspots

1971
01:26:00,704 --> 01:26:01,728
I think

1972
01:26:02,240 --> 01:26:04,800
Something that you viscerally an emotionally

1973
01:26:05,056 --> 01:26:06,592
Are taught isn't something

1974
01:26:07,104 --> 01:26:09,152
It's very easy to rationally untie

1975
01:26:09,408 --> 01:26:11,456
Sure I think I think that those are such a different

1976
01:26:11,712 --> 01:26:12,480
Processes

1977
01:26:14,016 --> 01:26:14,784
You want it

1978
01:26:15,296 --> 01:26:16,832
You wish right that it could be

1979
01:26:17,088 --> 01:26:17,600
Be that but it's

1980
01:26:18,112 --> 01:26:18,880
Unfortunately world

1981
01:26:19,136 --> 01:26:19,904
Doesn't work that way

1982
01:26:20,160 --> 01:26:24,000
And even worse is that when you you know if you can't counteract

1983
01:26:24,256 --> 01:26:25,280
Emotionally

1984
01:26:25,536 --> 01:26:26,048
Like fear

1985
01:26:26,304 --> 01:26:27,840
With rational thought youth

1986
01:26:28,096 --> 01:26:28,864
You think well maybe

1987
01:26:29,120 --> 01:26:30,144
You try and create

1988
01:26:30,400 --> 01:26:31,680
Try and use a different emotions

1989
01:26:31,936 --> 01:26:33,216
To counteract it and then you have no fun

1990
01:26:33,728 --> 01:26:34,240
That's going to

1991
01:26:34,752 --> 01:26:35,776
Nobody knows what happened

1992
01:26:36,032 --> 01:26:36,800
Whenever you start

1993
01:26:37,056 --> 01:26:38,592
A a people up in Alder

1994
01:26:39,104 --> 01:26:43,200
And I think there's also a secondary problem that comes in that

1995
01:26:43,712 --> 01:26:47,296
These people like Alex have a built-in way around

1996
01:26:47,808 --> 01:26:50,880
One of the teachable moments that could happen is like yes you emotion

1997
01:26:51,136 --> 01:26:51,648
Simile

1998
01:26:51,904 --> 01:26:52,416
Our trick

1999
01:26:52,672 --> 01:26:54,720
Into buying all this s***

2000
01:26:54,976 --> 01:26:56,512
This crisis has doesn't

2001
01:26:56,768 --> 01:26:57,280
What happened

2002
01:26:57,536 --> 01:26:58,304
You would

2003
01:26:58,560 --> 01:27:00,352
Book back and be like hey wait a sec

2004
01:27:01,120 --> 01:27:01,632
You guys

2005
01:27:01,888 --> 01:27:07,520
F*** with me because you bought this food

2006
01:27:08,032 --> 01:27:09,056
The game is

2007
01:27:09,312 --> 01:27:09,824
Well

2008
01:27:10,336 --> 01:27:11,104
We look

2009
01:27:11,360 --> 01:27:13,152
Yes we narrowly escaped

2010
01:27:13,408 --> 01:27:15,200
Exile whatever this

2011
01:27:15,456 --> 01:27:19,552
And that way you guarantee that you'll have the ability to run this campaign x x again

2012
01:27:19,808 --> 01:27:21,344
Last time we almost

2013
01:27:21,600 --> 01:27:23,392
We almost needed that food last

2014
01:27:23,648 --> 01:27:24,416
At this time

2015
01:27:24,672 --> 01:27:25,952
Don't don't f*** it up

2016
01:27:26,976 --> 01:27:27,744
So it's all just

2017
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:29,024
Super exploitative

2018
01:27:29,280 --> 01:27:30,048
Yep

2019
01:27:30,304 --> 01:27:31,328
Marketing

2020
01:27:31,584 --> 01:27:32,352
And that's sad

2021
01:27:32,608 --> 01:27:34,144
That makes me very sad it is sad

2022
01:27:35,680 --> 01:27:37,728
It's so clear how

2023
01:27:37,984 --> 01:27:38,752
Alex

2024
01:27:39,264 --> 01:27:41,312
Wendy's on Fair he's got to be laughing

2025
01:27:41,568 --> 01:27:46,432
Can you people and also he let me go let me go back to my notes on

2026
01:27:46,688 --> 01:27:47,200
His weird ramble

2027
01:27:47,456 --> 01:27:50,528
He does not like it when people manipulate

2028
01:27:50,784 --> 01:27:51,296
His feeling

2029
01:27:51,552 --> 01:27:52,832
Snow so

2030
01:27:53,088 --> 01:27:56,160
It is totally fine for him though to manipulate other people

2031
01:27:56,416 --> 01:28:02,560
What's the best way to make sure no one's manipulating yours

2032
01:28:02,816 --> 01:28:04,608
Populating other people's feelings so

2033
01:28:05,120 --> 01:28:05,632
There we go

2034
01:28:05,888 --> 01:28:06,400
So Alex

2035
01:28:06,912 --> 01:28:09,728
Calls in the second hour of Sunday's show

2036
01:28:10,240 --> 01:28:15,616
And one man one of those callers has a theory about the Wuhan quarantine

2037
01:28:16,128 --> 01:28:16,896
And that is

2038
01:28:18,176 --> 01:28:19,456
Without its British Dahmer

2039
01:28:19,712 --> 01:28:21,760
Illinois

2040
01:28:23,040 --> 01:28:29,184
Dido next listen I just wanted to see if they would have just hold off Coronavirus

2041
01:28:29,440 --> 01:28:31,744
Cheyenne is just a ruse just a mask

2042
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:37,376
National notes of people movement so they get all these people inside these buildings and they go into the

2043
01:28:37,632 --> 01:28:39,680
Funnel systems and move

2044
01:28:40,704 --> 01:28:44,544
Ollie's large huge quantities of people wherever it is that they want

2045
01:28:45,056 --> 01:28:46,336
Preparing for

2046
01:28:46,592 --> 01:28:49,408
A possible ground Invasion per se

2047
01:28:49,664 --> 01:28:54,016
I mean what's what's

2048
01:28:54,784 --> 01:28:55,296
Speculate

2049
01:28:55,552 --> 01:28:59,904
In a world of constant lies and disinfo in the whole history of governments

2050
01:29:00,160 --> 01:29:01,440
Pennywise in huge hoaxes

2051
01:29:01,696 --> 01:29:04,256
You'd be crazy not to say that anything's possible

2052
01:29:05,024 --> 01:29:06,560
This color is a real dumb dumb

2053
01:29:06,816 --> 01:29:10,144
Although I do agree with Alex that everyone has a right to speculate about things

2054
01:29:10,400 --> 01:29:16,544
I wouldn't say that this guy can't sit around and think about how maybe this will coronavirus situation is just to give milk

2055
01:29:16,800 --> 01:29:18,592
Millions of people into a big building so they can go through

2056
01:29:18,848 --> 01:29:22,688
Underground tunnels so they can gain the element of surprise and I've grounded vision of

2057
01:29:23,200 --> 01:29:23,712
Somewhere

2058
01:29:24,224 --> 01:29:29,600
I think that's exactly the sort of thing that's appropriate for a conversation that involves a couple of dumb college students in a blunt

2059
01:29:29,856 --> 01:29:31,392
It's just not a serious Theory

2060
01:29:32,160 --> 01:29:35,232
Everyone has the right to speculate but that doesn't mean that all speculation

2061
01:29:35,488 --> 01:29:37,280
You should be respected and taken is equal

2062
01:29:37,792 --> 01:29:39,840
Some speculation is really stupid

2063
01:29:40,096 --> 01:29:44,704
And just because Alex wants to pretend that there's moral virtue in his practice of not doing any work

2064
01:29:44,960 --> 01:29:47,008
That doesn't mean he needs to validate s*** like that

2065
01:29:47,776 --> 01:29:48,288
A couple points

2066
01:29:49,312 --> 01:29:50,080
If This Were the

2067
01:29:50,336 --> 01:29:53,408
Plan I'm not sure how they would do that where they would be

2068
01:29:53,664 --> 01:29:54,432
Be grounded Vaden

2069
01:29:54,944 --> 01:29:56,480
Wuhan is pretty emblem

2070
01:29:56,736 --> 01:29:57,248
And in China

2071
01:29:57,504 --> 01:29:59,040
So you have to be

2072
01:29:59,296 --> 01:30:04,160
Really f****** long underground tunnel

2073
01:30:04,416 --> 01:30:07,232
Constructed I don't know man we can make a tunnel anywhere

2074
01:30:07,744 --> 01:30:10,304
The closest border to Wuhan is the East China Sea

2075
01:30:10,560 --> 01:30:12,864
I assume that's not where they're going to invade probably not

2076
01:30:13,120 --> 01:30:19,264
After that the closest country is Vietnam but I don't think invading their makes a whole lot of sense time to solve the issue

2077
01:30:19,520 --> 01:30:25,408
Once and for all Dan we're going to kill thousands of people build a tunnel to Vietnam and take the

2078
01:30:25,664 --> 01:30:26,432
The Vietcong

2079
01:30:26,688 --> 01:30:32,832
I think I'll be a really strange move geopolitical a sunshine it's a grounded plane Vietnam

2080
01:30:33,088 --> 01:30:37,952
Better leadership as we all know that's a huge issue that sure if they wanted to go like I'm sure this guy

2081
01:30:38,208 --> 01:30:40,256
Thinking like North Korea or Russia ever like

2082
01:30:40,768 --> 01:30:46,400
There's other cities they could have done this and if they wanted to do that much closer

2083
01:30:46,656 --> 01:30:52,800
People off It's too convenient for a tunnel danu if you put it in Wuhan fairy know nobody's going to

2084
01:30:53,056 --> 01:30:55,104
I'll be looking for your tunnel very dumb.

2085
01:30:55,616 --> 01:30:56,128
Who it is

2086
01:30:56,384 --> 01:30:57,920
Alex's own s*** is so we

2087
01:30:58,176 --> 01:31:02,272
Weak that he can't afford to even push back against the stupidest things his collar say

2088
01:31:03,552 --> 01:31:05,088
Accidentally training them to think critically

2089
01:31:05,600 --> 01:31:11,744
If he helps them recognize why their own idea is bad it's only a matter of time before they apply that to his b*******

2090
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:13,536
And the next thing you know food bucket

2091
01:31:13,792 --> 01:31:14,560
Sales dry up in

2092
01:31:14,816 --> 01:31:15,584
You can't be having that

2093
01:31:16,352 --> 01:31:22,496
So you just allows this or what if she Jinping was the only guy to have

2094
01:31:22,752 --> 01:31:27,104
The coronavirus so we gave it to other people cuz you didn't want to be lonely

2095
01:31:27,616 --> 01:31:29,408
Write more dumb calls

2096
01:31:29,664 --> 01:31:31,456
And

2097
01:31:32,224 --> 01:31:34,784
He's loving taking these calls though because like it's

2098
01:31:35,296 --> 01:31:41,440
Just like not doing anything dumb stuff and then he's like you know what we're right because like a good idea let's go

2099
01:31:41,696 --> 01:31:43,232
Is it a possibility

2100
01:31:43,488 --> 01:31:44,768
So he starts thinking about like

2101
01:31:45,536 --> 01:31:47,584
I got to do this call or call-in show

2102
01:31:47,840 --> 01:31:49,376
The show that's just all calls

2103
01:31:50,144 --> 01:31:50,912
And he's like

2104
01:31:51,936 --> 01:31:52,448
An innovator

2105
01:31:54,240 --> 01:31:54,752
Jeanette Lee

2106
01:31:55,264 --> 01:31:56,288
They look this is

2107
01:31:56,544 --> 01:31:58,336
This is kind of like almost like you couldn't

2108
01:31:58,592 --> 01:31:59,360
Write this,

2109
01:31:59,872 --> 01:32:00,640
What ends up happening

2110
01:32:00,896 --> 01:32:03,200
After talking about how he's going to do this innovative

2111
01:32:03,456 --> 01:32:04,480
Show that just calls

2112
01:32:04,736 --> 01:32:05,248
Are you getting

2113
01:32:05,504 --> 01:32:06,272
The caller

2114
01:32:06,528 --> 01:32:07,040
Wow

2115
01:32:07,808 --> 01:32:09,344
I was thinking about doing new shows

2116
01:32:09,856 --> 01:32:11,904
I can tell you

2117
01:32:14,464 --> 01:32:16,512
I think the answer is like 2 or 3 hours a day

2118
01:32:17,280 --> 01:32:18,048
Commercial free

2119
01:32:18,816 --> 01:32:20,864
If TV radio station on the pickup that can

2120
01:32:21,632 --> 01:32:22,656
I'm just phone call

2121
01:32:22,912 --> 01:32:24,192
People want to hear people

2122
01:32:24,704 --> 01:32:25,472
You mean like love

2123
01:32:27,264 --> 01:32:28,032
Don't even screen

2124
01:32:28,800 --> 01:32:30,592
Will get a lot of really bad calls doing that

2125
01:32:30,848 --> 01:32:32,128

It's still not activating buddy

2144

2175
01:35:06,752 --> 01:35:12,896
Clock in its motivational American people

01:35:14,176 --> 01:35:15,200
Alright we can do this

2177
01:35:15,456 --> 01:35:16,224
Alright man I'm

2178
01:35:16,480 --> 01:35:18,784
Feeling at this guy's got I don't understand a word

2179
01:35:19,040 --> 01:35:20,832
Say what you got that Musical.

2180
01:35:21,088 --> 01:35:27,232
It's almost like something you would hear like it's morning time in China

2181
01:35:27,488 --> 01:35:33,632
You retired or Rich enough not to work you got to get out there alright hey let's go to Loverboy working for the weekend

2182
01:35:34,656 --> 01:35:40,800
It's 7:40 a.m. in Wuhan everybody we're going to have a grand old time everybody

2183
01:35:41,312 --> 01:35:46,688
Party hats on we're going to get right onto a baby

2184
01:35:46,944 --> 01:35:50,784
Nobles field like what I drive time DJ

2185
01:35:51,040 --> 01:35:52,832
Good morning DJ would have this riff

2186
01:35:53,088 --> 01:35:55,136
Every Monday

2187
01:35:55,392 --> 01:36:01,536
Alright it's Monday at 6 a.m. we're going to play some 311 for you piss off somebody I know

2188
01:36:03,072 --> 01:36:03,584
So

2189
01:36:04,096 --> 01:36:07,936
I've made the point that Alex is like the way you selling this immune gargle and is

2190
01:36:08,192 --> 01:36:09,472
Is toothpaste that has the silver and

2191
01:36:09,728 --> 01:36:11,520
He's really really inappropriate

2192
01:36:11,776 --> 01:36:16,640
And the way he's been making Health claims about it is really bad but now it's even branching out even further

2193
01:36:17,152 --> 01:36:19,456
Cuz now he's advising a caller

2194
01:36:19,968 --> 01:36:20,992
To use it

2195
01:36:21,248 --> 01:36:22,784
For protection

2196
01:36:23,296 --> 01:36:24,320
Against Coronavirus

2197
01:36:25,088 --> 01:36:26,368
I did buy your

2198
01:36:27,648 --> 01:36:28,672
Immune gargle

2199
01:36:28,928 --> 01:36:30,976
Toothpaste and all this stuff this week cuz I

2200
01:36:31,232 --> 01:36:32,768
I got to go back Taiwan tomorrow

2201
01:36:37,888 --> 01:36:38,656
Guzzling

2202
01:36:39,424 --> 01:36:40,960
Banana platinum silver weave

2203
01:36:43,264 --> 01:36:46,080
Your mouth

2204
01:36:47,872 --> 01:36:48,384
SARS

2205
01:36:48,640 --> 01:36:49,152
It's going to stop

2206
01:36:50,176 --> 01:36:50,688
No but

2207
01:36:50,944 --> 01:36:53,504
This is damn proven

2208
01:36:54,016 --> 01:36:56,832
So I mean we're getting now to the point where it's

2209
01:36:57,088 --> 01:36:57,600
Health aide

2210
01:36:57,856 --> 01:36:59,648
Advise that he's giving based on these

2211
01:36:59,904 --> 01:37:00,928
Claims that he's making

2212
01:37:01,440 --> 01:37:03,232
I mean I just think IQ

2213
01:37:03,488 --> 01:37:05,536
Nestled into a real comfort

2214
01:37:05,792 --> 01:37:08,096
About this I don't know how this is okay

2215
01:37:08,608 --> 01:37:09,376
It's not

2216
01:37:09,632 --> 01:37:10,144
If it's some

2217
01:37:10,400 --> 01:37:11,680
Some press needs to take this

2218
01:37:11,936 --> 01:37:16,800
Because it's not like the FDA or the episode

2219
01:37:17,056 --> 01:37:20,128
Correction that I need to make also apparently

2220
01:37:20,384 --> 01:37:23,200
Because he's making these claims in

2221
01:37:23,456 --> 01:37:26,528
The speech form is opposed to the label on his bottle

2222
01:37:26,784 --> 01:37:27,552
It's more an issue with the

2223
01:37:27,808 --> 01:37:30,368
Federal Trade Commission

2224
01:37:30,880 --> 01:37:31,904
I got those

2225
01:37:32,160 --> 01:37:35,488
Example of a monitor

2226
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:39,840
Forgot her but unfortunately unfortunate

2227
01:37:41,376 --> 01:37:42,656
Stop that

2228
01:37:43,168 --> 01:37:43,680
So

2229
01:37:44,448 --> 01:37:47,776
He's making all these pretty outrageous

2230
01:37:48,032 --> 01:37:49,312
Commercials about the gargle

2231
01:37:50,080 --> 01:37:52,640
But we do know that Alex had his first fever

2232
01:37:52,896 --> 01:37:56,224
In four years and have to gargle and it cured him

2233
01:37:56,480 --> 01:37:59,296
Absolute Total

2234
01:37:59,552 --> 01:38:00,064
Turns out it did

2235
01:38:00,320 --> 01:38:02,112
Exhausted

2236
01:38:02,368 --> 01:38:04,160
You know I was bragging

2237
01:38:04,416 --> 01:38:05,696
But

2238
01:38:06,464 --> 01:38:08,000
Nicole number for years

2239
01:38:08,256 --> 01:38:14,400
And then I got one this week so I'm kind of out of it today and have a lot of family stuff going on I'm trying as best I can I'm sorry

2240
01:38:14,912 --> 01:38:16,448
Daddy call me back tomorrow

2241
01:38:16,704 --> 01:38:20,032
Looks like it was lying

2242
01:38:20,288 --> 01:38:20,800
All the time

2243
01:38:21,056 --> 01:38:22,080
Looks like he was lying

2244
01:38:22,336 --> 01:38:24,896
About

2245
01:38:25,152 --> 01:38:25,664
So pray

2246
01:38:25,920 --> 01:38:28,224
Steve pieczenik does still have the Coronavirus

2247
01:38:28,480 --> 01:38:33,088
Psy I don't know if you know this but herself these guys are making himself

2248
01:38:33,344 --> 01:38:36,160
Okay so Alex that's his way of being like

2249
01:38:36,416 --> 01:38:37,440
I can't take any more calls

2250
01:38:37,696 --> 01:38:38,976
Yeah I don't know

2251
01:38:39,488 --> 01:38:41,536
This is which has struck me as kind of weird

2252
01:38:41,792 --> 01:38:44,608

Alexa AM FM

Oh my God thank you say Frosty out there

2266
01:39:14,560 --> 01:39:17,376
So I was just going to do an episode about the 9th cuz I think there's a

2267
01:39:17,632 --> 01:39:23,776
Plenty in there I was getting freaked out about 3:11 getting back into Seth rich

2268
01:39:24,032 --> 01:39:26,336
7:40 a.m. but I could just listen to that club

2269
01:39:26,592 --> 01:39:32,480
For sure about Wolf Blitzer that lead to him confessing to multiple murders

2270
01:39:32,736 --> 01:39:35,552
Lot going on

2271
01:39:36,064 --> 01:39:40,672
I got a tip-off that Robert Barnes is back

2272
01:39:41,184 --> 01:39:42,976
I'll go ahead listen to this

2273
01:39:43,232 --> 01:39:44,256
Barnes appearances

2274
01:39:44,512 --> 01:39:45,024
Really that

2275
01:39:45,792 --> 01:39:47,584
Exciting

2276
01:39:49,120 --> 01:39:50,400
A barn seems to be willing to

2277
01:39:50,656 --> 01:39:51,168
Call in now

2278
01:39:52,960 --> 01:39:54,496
The studio

2279
01:39:55,008 --> 01:39:57,568
I'm he calls in and it's fine it's whatever he's at calling

2280
01:39:57,824 --> 01:39:58,848
For new church committee

2281
01:39:59,104 --> 01:40:00,384
Hearing and whatever

2282
01:40:02,176 --> 01:40:04,224
There is something that's going on that's worth noting

2283
01:40:04,736 --> 01:40:08,576
This episode I'm not going to get into like his standard coronavirus stuff

2284
01:40:09,088 --> 01:40:11,904
Just yet background

2285
01:40:12,160 --> 01:40:13,696
There's something more important going on

2286
01:40:13,952 --> 01:40:14,720
The first is

2287
01:40:14,976 --> 01:40:17,792
Did Alex is really excited about things that Charles

2288
01:40:18,048 --> 01:40:18,560
Murray has

2289
01:40:18,816 --> 01:40:20,352
To say

2290
01:40:20,608 --> 01:40:22,400
But that leads him to

2291
01:40:23,168 --> 01:40:25,472
Basically telling his audience that it's time

2292
01:40:25,728 --> 01:40:26,240
To go to

2293
01:40:26,496 --> 01:40:27,520
To the woods

2294
01:40:28,032 --> 01:40:29,312
Focus Murray

2295
01:40:29,568 --> 01:40:31,872
Cuz we're living in post America

2296
01:40:33,408 --> 01:40:35,968
A small town to survive

2297
01:40:37,504 --> 01:40:38,016
The collapse

2298
01:40:40,320 --> 01:40:40,832
And yes

2299
01:40:43,136 --> 01:40:43,648
If

2300
01:40:44,160 --> 01:40:48,768
We don't turn America around and Route the leftist poison ideology

2301
01:40:49,280 --> 01:40:50,560
That is design

2302
01:40:51,328 --> 01:40:52,608
The collapse Society

2303
01:40:53,888 --> 01:40:55,424
Then the producers

2304
01:40:57,216 --> 01:41:01,824
Are the UB white black Hispanic old young but people that want to live like normal humans

2305
01:41:02,336 --> 01:41:03,360
I want to live in

2306
01:41:04,128 --> 01:41:05,920
What America was

2307
01:41:06,688 --> 01:41:09,504
You don't want to live in the globalist paradigm

2308
01:41:09,760 --> 01:41:10,272
Backwards

2309
01:41:11,808 --> 01:41:13,856
Geographic areas

2310
01:41:15,392 --> 01:41:17,696
My flaws and have culture and systems

2311
01:41:17,952 --> 01:41:19,488
That do not tolerate the left

2312
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:21,280
Because they don't tolerate us

2313
01:41:22,048 --> 01:41:23,840
They come in and take over and then end

2314
01:41:24,864 --> 01:41:28,448
I wonder if that's going to end up looking at all like a white ethnostate theocracy

2315
01:41:29,472 --> 01:41:29,984
Wonder

2316
01:41:30,240 --> 01:41:36,384
Good man charles-marie is the author of the book the bell curve which has been widely discredited but yeah

2317
01:41:36,640 --> 01:41:37,152
That lives on

2318
01:41:37,408 --> 01:41:40,480
Is one of the foundational text among the race IQ people

2319
01:41:40,736 --> 01:41:42,016
You like to argue that minorities are

2320
01:41:42,272 --> 01:41:42,784
Genetically less

2321
01:41:43,040 --> 01:41:43,808
Intelligent than white people

2322
01:41:44,320 --> 01:41:44,832
But

2323
01:41:45,088 --> 01:41:50,208
White people less intelligent than Ashkenazi Jew

2324
01:41:50,720 --> 01:41:51,488
Respect your enemy

2325
01:41:51,744 --> 01:41:52,256
Haha

2326
01:41:52,768 --> 01:41:54,560
His career has largely been about trying

2327
01:41:54,816 --> 01:41:57,888
Need to take social ills like racism and sexism and explain them with

2328
01:41:58,144 --> 01:41:59,680
Genetics and it is not been a good guy

2329
01:41:59,936 --> 01:42:03,008
You don't have to feel like it's your fault at all

2330
01:42:03,264 --> 01:42:06,336
Charles Lane did a piece on the bell curve in the New York Review of Books

2331
01:42:06,592 --> 01:42:08,640
So noted that it was weird how number the egg

2332
01:42:08,896 --> 01:42:12,480
Expert see sites in the book are explicit races the Nazi sympathizers

2333
01:42:12,736 --> 01:42:14,784
Less than they are respected experts in the field

2334
01:42:15,040 --> 01:42:15,552
Are the book

2335
01:42:15,808 --> 01:42:16,576
Supposed to be covering

2336
01:42:17,088 --> 01:42:19,136
It's a pretty well explain thing that the bell curve is

2337
01:42:19,392 --> 01:42:22,720
Is trash anyone citing it as a source

2338
01:42:22,976 --> 01:42:24,256
Speaking well with Charles Murray

2339
01:42:24,512 --> 01:42:25,792
That's a red flag they might have so

2340
01:42:26,048 --> 01:42:28,352
Some crypto positions are trying to sneak into the conversation

2341
01:42:29,120 --> 01:42:29,632
Seems like Alex

2342
01:42:30,400 --> 01:42:32,960
Beer do with this dude that I got to say and now

2343
01:42:33,216 --> 01:42:34,496
We've got to isolate

2344
01:42:34,752 --> 01:42:37,568
We've gotta move our conservative right-wing

2345
01:42:38,592 --> 01:42:40,640
Into small areas and then take over

2346
01:42:41,152 --> 01:42:45,248
That's bad bad development to the regular Woods

2347
01:42:46,272 --> 01:42:48,320
Get rid of everybody get rid of your social

2348
01:42:48,576 --> 01:42:49,344
Security cards

2349
01:42:49,600 --> 01:42:51,136
Get rid of all I've done for you.

2350
01:42:51,392 --> 01:42:56,768
Infile GOP we got into the woods

2351
01:42:57,024 --> 01:42:59,584
Well it's more about going to rural areas

2352
01:42:59,840 --> 01:43:01,376
Alex is telling his audio

2353
01:43:01,632 --> 01:43:04,704
Italy that it is time to do the self-select

2354
01:43:05,472 --> 01:43:07,008
You have children you have a duty

2355
01:43:07,520 --> 01:43:10,080
Go to rural Christian areas

2356
01:43:11,616 --> 01:43:13,664
I'm outside of the big cities in the suburbs

2357
01:43:15,456 --> 01:43:16,480
Running

2358
01:43:16,992 --> 01:43:20,832
Get out of those places and fight for the rest of the nation

2359
01:43:21,088 --> 01:43:22,624
Globus while you're there

2360
01:43:23,648 --> 01:43:25,184
You need to run with your children

2361
01:43:25,440 --> 01:43:25,952
The most

2362
01:43:26,464 --> 01:43:29,536
Conservative Christian nationalist Patriot are you can

2363
01:43:29,792 --> 01:43:30,304
Okay

2364
01:43:30,816 --> 01:43:31,328
This is

2365
01:43:31,584 --> 01:43:32,864
Like I know that is audience

2366
01:43:33,120 --> 01:43:35,680
It's probably isn't going to hear that and be like well let's go

2367
01:43:35,936 --> 01:43:37,728
Is there are a couple people who take

2368
01:43:37,984 --> 01:43:38,496
Take his advice

2369
01:43:39,520 --> 01:43:44,640
Basically telling his audience to uproot their lives and go someplace where they can

2370
01:43:44,896 --> 01:43:45,408
Can be in a

2371
01:43:45,664 --> 01:43:46,432
Colt kind of

2372
01:43:47,456 --> 01:43:53,600
Yes what they should do is go create utopian communes based around Chris

2373
01:43:53,856 --> 01:43:55,904
Christian conservative ideology

2374
01:43:56,160 --> 01:43:57,184
You know how those work out

2375
01:43:57,952 --> 01:43:59,488
I don't think this is a good develop

2376
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:06,144
But Alex's pretty consistent about it throughout the show he's a he's a note hard his half his rhetoric has taken

2377
01:44:06,400 --> 01:44:06,912
Envy

2378
01:44:07,168 --> 01:44:13,312
Jim Jones fleeing to Guyana

2379
01:44:14,336 --> 01:44:20,480
That sort of conversation is becoming introduced into the proceedings which is not good I mean I think it's also part of

2380
01:44:20,736 --> 01:44:21,248
The

2381
01:44:21,504 --> 01:44:22,272
Just voting

2382
01:44:22,784 --> 01:44:23,552
That idea of

2383
01:44:23,808 --> 01:44:25,856
People in cities armorica

2384
01:44:26,112 --> 01:44:27,136
Supposed to learning

2385
01:44:27,392 --> 01:44:31,488
Less likely to be you call it learning

2386
01:44:33,792 --> 01:44:34,304
Apologies

2387
01:44:34,560 --> 01:44:36,352
But this also raises the question of like Alex

2388
01:44:36,608 --> 01:44:37,632
You live in Austin

2389
01:44:37,888 --> 01:44:40,192
What are you talkin about his moves to the woods

2390
01:44:40,448 --> 01:44:40,960
You not

2391
01:44:41,216 --> 01:44:44,032
Although he does make completely not true claim

2392
01:44:44,288 --> 01:44:44,800
And the snakes

2393
01:44:45,568 --> 01:44:46,592
Soon as I can

2394
01:44:47,104 --> 01:44:48,128
I am moving out of Austin

2395
01:44:49,152 --> 01:44:50,944
My mom's from here and my family from here

2396
01:44:51,712 --> 01:44:52,992
But it is

2397
01:44:54,016 --> 01:44:55,296
Move my children San Francisco

2398
01:44:56,320 --> 01:45:00,160
And it states it's a skeleton in water areas now it's getting worse

2399
01:45:00,928 --> 01:45:04,768
California collapses in

2400
01:45:08,608 --> 01:45:11,680
Children to a safer distance away from Sodom and Gomorrah

2401
01:45:12,192 --> 01:45:12,704
And then

2402
01:45:13,216 --> 01:45:15,520
Author of the time because

2403
01:45:17,568 --> 01:45:19,104
Our money where our mouths are

2404
01:45:19,616 --> 01:45:20,640
What you don't

2405
01:45:21,408 --> 01:45:22,688
Earliest time to evacuate

2406
01:45:23,968 --> 01:45:24,992
Major blue City craft

2407
01:45:25,760 --> 01:45:29,344
Tell Alex is suggesting that he's going to move away from Austin

2408
01:45:29,600 --> 01:45:34,976
I'm telecommute in he's just going to do his show remotely from somewhere

2409
01:45:35,488 --> 01:45:41,632
Multimillion-dollar Studio then

2410
01:45:41,888 --> 01:45:44,704
Fuse for the coming downsizing but he's going to have to do

2411
01:45:44,960 --> 01:45:48,544
Cuz he's running out of f****** money even with the infusion of whatever he's making

2412
01:45:49,056 --> 01:45:50,848
From the silver and black

2413
01:45:51,104 --> 01:45:51,616
Good sales

2414
01:45:52,384 --> 01:45:53,664
Not enough to right the ship

2415
01:45:53,920 --> 01:45:54,432
I think this is

2416
01:45:55,200 --> 01:45:58,016
Could be a preemptive

2417
01:45:58,272 --> 01:46:01,088
Priming of people for when

2418
01:46:01,344 --> 01:46:02,880
Inevitably he might be doing

2419
01:46:03,392 --> 01:46:03,904
Cast what

2420
01:46:04,928 --> 01:46:11,072
Only way to do it safely

2421
01:46:11,328 --> 01:46:13,120
Alex Jones bass podcast

2422
01:46:13,376 --> 01:46:17,472
Goodluck Goodluck

2423
01:46:20,288 --> 01:46:21,568
So Alex take some calls

2424
01:46:21,824 --> 01:46:24,640
Diane of course the subject of the coronavirus comes up

2425
01:46:24,896 --> 01:46:25,920
And man

2426
01:46:26,688 --> 01:46:28,224
That dude was talking about

2427
01:46:28,480 --> 01:46:29,248
The

2428
01:46:29,760 --> 01:46:31,296
The Serta tunnel Theory

2429
01:46:31,808 --> 01:46:33,344
He was dumb but this guy is also.

2430
01:46:33,600 --> 01:46:36,160
Find out real quick the morbidity rate

2431
01:46:36,672 --> 01:46:38,976
I hope it's super super love

2432
01:46:39,488 --> 01:46:40,512
What are you predicting

2433
01:46:43,072 --> 01:46:44,352
I'm hoping it's going to be low

2434
01:46:44,864 --> 01:46:46,656
Like my brother told me I don't know where you got this

2435
01:46:48,704 --> 01:46:51,776
Remember don't pop any bubble wrap because of all the air comes from China

2436
01:46:54,848 --> 01:46:58,176
Another good choice

2437
01:46:59,200 --> 01:47:00,992
Sister Sister

2438
01:47:02,272 --> 01:47:08,416
Satisfying feeling of popping bubble wrap

2439
01:47:08,672 --> 01:47:10,208
With there are that they put in

2440
01:47:10,464 --> 01:47:12,256
Totally

2441
01:47:12,768 --> 01:47:13,792
Analysis response

2442
01:47:14,048 --> 01:47:15,328
Another dollar coin

2443
01:47:17,120 --> 01:47:19,936
This random caller what's a prediction

2444
01:47:20,192 --> 01:47:21,472
For the morbidity rate

2445
01:47:21,728 --> 01:47:24,288
Diculous I don't know but Chinese arrow kill you

2446
01:47:24,544 --> 01:47:27,104
Tonight in bubble wrap is in

2447
01:47:27,872 --> 01:47:34,016
The largest bubble wrap company in the world is sealed air corporation which is started by you look good

2448
01:47:34,528 --> 01:47:36,832
Who was an engineer who lived in New Jersey

2449
01:47:37,344 --> 01:47:39,648
Their headquarters is currently in Charlotte North Carolina

2450
01:47:39,904 --> 01:47:42,976
And I can find no evidence of their bubble wrap is primarily made in China

2451
01:47:43,744 --> 01:47:45,536
Also bubble wrap is sterile

2452
01:47:45,792 --> 01:47:49,376
The inside of it so that you can find a 2014

2453
01:47:49,632 --> 01:47:55,776
Teen study from NPR I'm sorry story from NPR about how researchers at Harvard found that they could use bubble wrap asthma

2454
01:47:56,032 --> 01:47:57,056
Makeshift up makeshift

2455
01:47:57,312 --> 01:47:58,080
Kind of test do

2456
01:47:58,592 --> 01:48:01,664
Which could have amazing applications for underfunded scientist

2457
01:48:01,920 --> 01:48:02,944
Particularly in developing

2458
01:48:03,200 --> 01:48:03,712
Open countries

2459
01:48:04,224 --> 01:48:07,296
They wrote up their findings in the journal analytical chemistry

2460
01:48:07,552 --> 01:48:10,112
And everything I guess that's really cool

2461
01:48:10,368 --> 01:48:10,880
Yeah

2462
01:48:11,136 --> 01:48:13,184
A follow-up study in the biomedical Optics

2463
01:48:13,440 --> 01:48:15,488
Express Journal had this and it's abstract

2464
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:19,584
Quote is this paper we demonstrate that the bubbles of bubble wrap make

2465
01:48:19,840 --> 01:48:23,424
Deal trapping Chambers for integration with low-cost Optical manipulation

2466
01:48:23,936 --> 01:48:29,056
The interior of the bubbles is sterile and gas permeable allowing for the bubble to be used to store in

2467
01:48:29,312 --> 01:48:30,080
Culture cell

2468
01:48:30,336 --> 01:48:35,712
Garibaldi's left side of the bubble wrap is efficient Optical quality to allow for optical trapping

2469
01:48:35,968 --> 01:48:36,736
Inside the bubbles

2470
01:48:37,504 --> 01:48:42,368
If the interior bubble wrap is sterile enough for scientists to use them to create lab cultures

2471
01:48:42,624 --> 01:48:45,696
I don't think this caller in his dumb brother need to be too worried about it

2472
01:48:46,208 --> 01:48:47,232
But here again we have Al

2473
01:48:47,488 --> 01:48:50,560
It's responding to a very stupid boy by saying it's a good point

2474
01:48:51,328 --> 01:48:53,376
It's almost like he has a vested interest in validating

2475
01:48:53,632 --> 01:48:55,936
Supporting really bad thinking in his audience

2476
01:48:58,240 --> 01:49:00,288
She still pop those bubbles

2477
01:49:00,800 --> 01:49:01,824
You see the game

2478
01:49:02,080 --> 01:49:03,360
Games are being played here so stupid

2479
01:49:04,128 --> 01:49:04,640
So

2480
01:49:04,896 --> 01:49:09,248
We know that in the past whenever Alex is going on these large-scale

2481
01:49:09,504 --> 01:49:10,016
Narrative

2482
01:49:10,272 --> 01:49:11,552
Like with the Boston bombing

2483
01:49:12,064 --> 01:49:15,392
In particular it is in terms of the ones that we've seen it really

2484
01:49:15,648 --> 01:49:18,976
Focused on ending the trumps up to to it

2485
01:49:20,256 --> 01:49:23,328
We've seen evidence that his traffic was way up

2486
01:49:23,840 --> 01:49:26,656
And now as he embarks on this Coronavirus

2487
01:49:27,680 --> 01:49:28,448
We see him

2488
01:49:28,960 --> 01:49:29,984
Experiencing the same thing

2489
01:49:31,008 --> 01:49:35,360
I'll say this video is really explode into lizards doing a great job

2490
01:49:36,128 --> 01:49:38,688
Getting the videos out at we got we're getting

2491
01:49:39,712 --> 01:49:44,576
For 56 million views a day now Amanda video that really pisses Google off

2492
01:49:49,952 --> 01:49:50,720
Boil

2493
01:49:51,488 --> 01:49:55,840
Set on Friday the White House should investigate this is man-made hours later they made that announcement

2494
01:49:56,096 --> 01:49:59,936
No it was the day before Thursday

2495
01:50:00,448 --> 01:50:03,008
I went to still trying to create that experience

2496
01:50:03,264 --> 01:50:04,800
That the boil interview

2497
01:50:05,056 --> 01:50:07,104
Lay the two Trump science

2498
01:50:07,360 --> 01:50:08,128
Advisor

2499
01:50:08,640 --> 01:50:09,664
Coming out who I am

2500
01:50:09,920 --> 01:50:10,688
Vicki still thinks of anthem

2501
01:50:10,944 --> 01:50:11,456
Funny fauci which

2502
01:50:12,224 --> 01:50:12,736
Funny

2503
01:50:13,248 --> 01:50:16,832
So here's another example of Alex use

2504
01:50:17,344 --> 01:50:18,368
The help

2505
01:50:18,624 --> 01:50:19,136
Claim

2506
01:50:19,648 --> 01:50:20,928
About the

2507
01:50:21,184 --> 01:50:23,744
It's over in order to sell his toothpaste interview gargle

2508
01:50:24,000 --> 01:50:26,560
Which is not cool we sold out of the 16 oz

2509
01:50:27,072 --> 01:50:30,400
Nanosilver that still good to counter the whole Coronavirus

2510
01:50:30,656 --> 01:50:31,168
A family

2511
01:50:32,192 --> 01:50:34,496
3 oz Lafayette selling out

2512
01:50:34,752 --> 01:50:37,056
Quickly as well as the one ounce of selling album

2513
01:50:37,824 --> 01:50:38,336
Frequently

2514
01:50:38,592 --> 01:50:42,432
Bernardo spray on your hands and not even also ingested

2515
01:50:42,688 --> 01:50:48,832
Kleinfeld super blue and Super Silver

2516
01:50:49,088 --> 01:50:50,368
As well

2517
01:50:50,880 --> 01:50:53,440
So he's just today

2518
01:50:53,696 --> 01:50:56,256
Brazen just silver silver put it in your body

2519
01:50:57,536 --> 01:51:03,680
So Alex is barns on North too many clips of this cuz I didn't find it all that interesting

2520
01:51:03,936 --> 01:51:04,448
There are a couple things

2521
01:51:04,704 --> 01:51:07,520
And one is it they're talkin about a trump is beat the

2522
01:51:08,544 --> 01:51:09,312
Nothing

2523
01:51:09,568 --> 01:51:10,592
And

2524
01:51:10,848 --> 01:51:12,128
It said he's a Barnes

2525
01:51:12,640 --> 01:51:15,200
How are they going to how are they going to come out of next

2526
01:51:15,968 --> 01:51:17,504
And I think Alex might

2527
01:51:17,760 --> 01:51:18,272
Have

2528
01:51:18,784 --> 01:51:19,808
Something in mind

2529
01:51:20,320 --> 01:51:23,904
How you say you're going to try to come up the president next if he doesn't go on the offense immediately

2530
01:51:24,928 --> 01:51:27,488
He's definitely coming taking about these

2531
01:51:28,768 --> 01:51:30,048
They recognizes to closing time

2532
01:51:31,072 --> 01:51:35,424
3 is either going to be right in the middle of the election of right after the election my guess is it's coming as a knock

2533
01:51:35,936 --> 01:51:36,960
Surprised again

2534
01:51:37,728 --> 01:51:38,240
Again

2535
01:51:39,264 --> 01:51:41,824
What would it be I'm asking that level

2536
01:51:43,360 --> 01:51:45,664
The same Say it'll be the same type but they will try to

2537
01:51:46,176 --> 01:51:50,528
Will be same International orientation will be some sort of Russian collusion component again

2538
01:51:52,064 --> 01:51:52,576
Friday

2539
01:51:53,088 --> 01:51:53,600
Campaign aspec

2540
01:51:53,856 --> 01:51:55,136
They've tried the institution last

2541
01:51:55,904 --> 01:51:56,416
This one's going to be

2542
01:51:56,672 --> 01:51:57,184
Personal

2543
01:51:59,744 --> 01:52:00,512
Thailand money in some way

2544
01:52:01,792 --> 01:52:05,888
They're going to try to find somebody something corrupting her Giant

2545
01:52:06,144 --> 01:52:12,288
They don't say Trump laundered money or something I'd rather going to go after mafia ties next

2546
01:52:12,800 --> 01:52:18,944
My gut tells me you're call Straight Ahead when are we heard Alex talking about Trump and Mafia

2547
01:52:19,200 --> 01:52:20,224
Retired

2548
01:52:20,480 --> 01:52:26,624
Jesus maybe before he supported the name like Corleone you get arrested

2549
01:52:26,880 --> 01:52:27,904
The name like Trump you don't

2550
01:52:28,416 --> 01:52:31,488
Trump is mobbed up he's not really rich everyone knows

2551
01:52:32,256 --> 01:52:32,768
God

2552
01:52:33,024 --> 01:52:33,536
Interested

2553
01:52:33,792 --> 01:52:35,840
I think that's preemptive damage control

2554
01:52:36,096 --> 01:52:41,472
There is a story that comes out that is more explicit about linking Trump to mob money

2555
01:52:43,776 --> 01:52:48,640
That's Alex recognizing like a piece of his awareness I guess I need to protect against this

2556
01:52:48,896 --> 01:52:49,408
So let's predict

2557
01:52:49,664 --> 01:52:50,176
Victon advance

2558
01:52:50,688 --> 01:52:52,992
That this is going to be something that comes up

2559
01:52:53,248 --> 01:52:56,320
So it'll

2560
01:52:56,576 --> 01:52:58,368
That was one of my that's one of my

2561
01:52:58,624 --> 01:53:00,160
Huge f****** annoyance

2562
01:53:00,928 --> 01:53:02,720
The way it was portrayed so many

2563
01:53:03,232 --> 01:53:04,000
Wasn't somebody different

2564
01:53:04,256 --> 01:53:05,536
Media Outlets of like

2565
01:53:05,792 --> 01:53:09,120
Trump defeats impeachment Pusher Trump beats the impeachment

2566
01:53:09,632 --> 01:53:10,400
Which is f******

2567
01:53:10,656 --> 01:53:11,168
Convulsion

2568
01:53:11,424 --> 01:53:13,984
Truck what he did was everything possible

2569
01:53:14,240 --> 01:53:15,008
To f******

2570
01:53:15,264 --> 01:53:16,032
The defender

2571
01:53:16,288 --> 01:53:17,056
But they put more

2572
01:53:17,312 --> 01:53:20,896
Truxtun Beach

2573
01:53:21,408 --> 01:53:23,456
A Ramen

2574
01:53:24,224 --> 01:53:27,296
That's what happened except that Romney

2575
01:53:27,552 --> 01:53:28,832
Don't don't say

2576
01:53:29,088 --> 01:53:30,624
Chalkbeat anyting

2577
01:53:30,880 --> 01:53:31,648
Did the crime

2578
01:53:31,904 --> 01:53:33,440
And then he actively work

2579
01:53:33,696 --> 01:53:37,792
To undermine his defense are there afterwards undermined it

2580
01:53:38,048 --> 01:53:40,608
Treated himself through it that's what he did

2581
01:53:40,864 --> 01:53:43,424
Yeah

2582
01:53:43,936 --> 01:53:47,264
Just a bunch of f****** admitting to crimes on videos

2583
01:53:48,032 --> 01:53:51,872
What's the best legal team this side of the o.j. trial

2584
01:53:54,432 --> 01:53:58,016
So they're talking a little bit about the firing

2585
01:53:58,272 --> 01:54:03,136
Trump is started cleaning house

2586
01:54:03,392 --> 01:54:04,160
Into that

2587
01:54:12,352 --> 01:54:14,656
Office does

2588
01:54:17,216 --> 01:54:19,520
We come on Friday with a head of the broom

2589
01:54:19,776 --> 01:54:23,872
Bioweapons developer for the US had guy

2590
01:54:24,128 --> 01:54:27,200
It looks like it's man-made

2591
01:54:27,456 --> 01:54:29,760
5 hours later they doing

2592
01:54:30,272 --> 01:54:32,832
You just lying to Barnes about the timeline

2593
01:54:33,088 --> 01:54:34,880
Jesus

2594
01:54:35,136 --> 01:54:36,672
Horse yeah we have anybody

2595
01:54:36,928 --> 01:54:40,512
Even Steven Miller if he does listen which I can't imagine

2596
01:54:41,024 --> 01:54:42,304
But even if he does listen

2597
01:54:42,816 --> 01:54:43,328
Do you like

2598
01:54:43,584 --> 01:54:49,728
I got this guy's going to be so easy to use talking about carpet

2599
01:54:49,984 --> 01:54:56,128
Cleaning

2600
01:54:56,384 --> 01:54:58,176
Play slow and I've done it multiple times be like

2601
01:54:58,688 --> 01:54:59,456
I could see

2602
01:55:01,760 --> 01:55:02,528
The carpet cleaning

2603
01:55:03,040 --> 01:55:03,552
Right

2604
01:55:04,064 --> 01:55:04,576
Nausea

2605
01:55:04,832 --> 01:55:05,344
Styles for

2606
01:55:05,856 --> 01:55:11,232
So we have one last clip here and it's a Barnes is still there but Alex Goes to calls

2607
01:55:11,488 --> 01:55:13,024
Can you text a call from a guy who has

2608
01:55:13,280 --> 01:55:15,072
Updates about the Coronavirus

2609
01:55:15,584 --> 01:55:16,864
Numbers of the Coronavirus

2610
01:55:17,632 --> 01:55:18,400
Started reporting

2611
01:55:23,008 --> 01:55:23,520
3000

2612
01:55:24,544 --> 01:55:25,312
69 people have

2613
01:55:30,944 --> 01:55:31,712
Be a 24

2614
01:55:32,480 --> 01:55:33,504
Mortality rate

2615
01:55:34,272 --> 01:55:36,832
Official numbers now show it has a much higher

2616
01:55:38,368 --> 01:55:42,464
Chinese government says 15%

2617
01:55:42,976 --> 01:55:45,536
Numbers cruncher

2618
01:55:46,048 --> 01:55:47,584
What do you think about the numbers

2619
01:55:49,376 --> 01:55:50,912
Numbers are

2620
01:55:51,168 --> 01:55:52,192
Continue to rise

2621
01:55:52,448 --> 01:55:53,728
So this colors misusing

2622
01:55:53,984 --> 01:55:54,496
Statistics

2623
01:55:55,008 --> 01:55:58,336
That 20% figure comes from a study that looked at patients who had

2624
01:55:58,592 --> 01:56:01,152
To be hospitalized because their cases were really

2625
01:56:01,408 --> 01:56:07,296
Severe which includes only people would been that had their condition progressed to the point of having pneumonia right

2626
01:56:07,808 --> 01:56:13,952
The number of people who have recovered from the disease is not an accurate picture of people who got a mild case and then just had some flu symptoms and got the

2627
01:56:14,208 --> 01:56:19,072
Better it's specifically the number of people who were hospitalized for pneumonia from the Coronavirus

2628
01:56:19,328 --> 01:56:20,608
Who recovered and left the hospital

2629
01:56:21,632 --> 01:56:22,400
And honestly

2630
01:56:22,912 --> 01:56:29,056
You know even if you're talkin about a 20% mortality rate for people in that subset of people who got the virus

2631
01:56:29,312 --> 01:56:34,688
That's not wildly out of sync with the general expectations you have for people who have cases of pneumonia General

2632
01:56:35,456 --> 01:56:36,992
According to Healthline quote

2633
01:56:37,248 --> 01:56:40,320
The 30-day mortality rate for people in Livonia is 52

2634
01:56:40,576 --> 01:56:42,112
10% of hospitalized patients

2635
01:56:42,624 --> 01:56:43,392
They can be up

2636
01:56:43,648 --> 01:56:45,696
30% in those admitted to intensive

2637
01:56:45,952 --> 01:56:46,464
Care

2638
01:56:46,976 --> 01:56:49,792
Oftentimes these numbers comes out really horrifying when they're presented

2639
01:56:50,048 --> 01:56:50,816
Out of context

2640
01:56:51,072 --> 01:56:52,096
Like this caller is doing

2641
01:56:52,352 --> 01:56:54,144
It's really irresponsible of Alex

2642
01:56:54,656 --> 01:56:55,424
Particularly Barn

2643
01:56:55,936 --> 01:56:58,240
To frame it like that

2644
01:56:58,752 --> 01:57:01,312
They need to be able to understand this.

2645
01:57:01,568 --> 01:57:02,336
Statistics that they're talking

2646
01:57:02,592 --> 01:57:03,104
About

2647
01:57:03,360 --> 01:57:05,408
And discuss them appropriately are also

2648
01:57:05,664 --> 01:57:06,432
What they're doing is just

2649
01:57:07,712 --> 01:57:08,224
Ridiculous

2650
01:57:08,480 --> 01:57:10,528
And that's what you see consistently throughout all of the

2651
01:57:12,064 --> 01:57:14,880
Information from collars and validating it he has no idea what the

2652
01:57:15,136 --> 01:57:17,696
This caller is talking about to be like haha yes you got them

2653
01:57:17,952 --> 01:57:21,280
Please take a call from a guy was worried about bubble wrap it because that's a great point

2654
01:57:21,536 --> 01:57:24,352
Is it taking a call from a guy was like I think they're trying to

2655
01:57:25,632 --> 01:57:28,704
Hi there ever a land invasion of something

2656
01:57:28,960 --> 01:57:31,776
And he's like hey where we have the right to speculate about whatever we want

2657
01:57:32,032 --> 01:57:32,544
Good on you

2658
01:57:32,800 --> 01:57:34,080
I can't imagine why your trunk

2659
01:57:34,336 --> 01:57:36,128
Keeps winning non-college-educated White

2660
01:57:36,384 --> 01:57:40,736
That seems odd to me I don't know demography with your followers are

2661
01:57:40,992 --> 01:57:42,784
Volvo

2662
01:57:43,040 --> 01:57:44,832
If you look at

2663
01:57:45,088 --> 01:57:45,600
Places that

2664
01:57:45,856 --> 01:57:49,440
Break

2665
01:57:49,696 --> 01:57:53,792
What does a heavy Eddie section of his Target

2666
01:57:54,048 --> 01:57:54,560
Might be

2667
01:57:54,816 --> 01:57:56,352
So anyway

2668
01:57:56,608 --> 01:57:57,120
And I

2669
01:57:57,376 --> 01:57:59,936

2670
01:58:00,192 --> 01:58:03,520

He respects paramedics who Trump in his budget

2687
01:59:01,376 --> 01:59:01,888
Is probably

2688
01:59:02,400 --> 01:59:08,544
Enjoyed cleaning carpets

2689
