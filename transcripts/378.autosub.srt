1
00:00:21,248 --> 00:00:27,392
I have great respect for knowledge by knowledge I'm sick of them posing as you're through the good guy

2
00:00:34,048 --> 00:00:40,192
Need need money

3
00:00:53,248 --> 00:00:59,136
College vype.com

4
00:01:05,792 --> 00:01:10,400
About Alex Joe Jordan

5
00:01:10,656 --> 00:01:16,800
Louis ask you a quick question what's up end-of-the-year doing all kinds of recast of list

6
00:01:17,056 --> 00:01:20,640
All I Want To Know Dan is there anything in 2019 that has surprise

7
00:01:21,152 --> 00:01:24,736
Know exactly right

8
00:01:24,992 --> 00:01:30,368
Everything is so incredibly surprising nothing is surprising yeah you know

9
00:01:30,624 --> 00:01:33,952
You're like I can't believe they would just do that

10
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:39,072
My brain's been burned out to novelty yeah yeah

11
00:01:39,328 --> 00:01:41,888
No try a nice dish

12
00:01:42,144 --> 00:01:45,728
Crazy alright cool

13
00:01:45,984 --> 00:01:48,288
I guess okay I'm a little surprised

14
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:50,080
Not drink

15
00:01:50,336 --> 00:01:56,480
It is much as I thought I was

16
00:01:56,736 --> 00:02:02,880
Maybe they have some of the same charm as for fun maybe I was 18 when I played the first one and I'm 35

17
00:02:06,976 --> 00:02:13,120
Imma try to play it slowly so it lasts you know I come back to it I don't even know what I'm doing

18
00:02:13,376 --> 00:02:17,984
I guess that's a little surprise is there a wrong direction

19
00:02:23,104 --> 00:02:24,640
Your friends were stuck in painting

20
00:02:24,896 --> 00:02:29,504
King Boo Butt

21
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,272
Run around

22
00:02:30,528 --> 00:02:33,600
Each level of this hotel is

23
00:02:33,856 --> 00:02:35,136
Spider ghost boss

24
00:02:35,392 --> 00:02:36,416
I don't know man

25
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:37,184
I don't know

26
00:02:37,952 --> 00:02:44,096
By Kester I do a lot of surprises this year but I do know a lot about Alex Jones

27
00:02:44,352 --> 00:02:50,496
And I don't know I know

28
00:02:50,752 --> 00:02:54,848
Today we're going to be going over some depositions that drops

29
00:02:55,104 --> 00:02:58,176
At the end of last week at the end of November

30
00:02:58,432 --> 00:03:04,576
All three of the Musketeers Rob do Paul Joseph Watson Alex Jones

31
00:03:04,832 --> 00:03:08,672
Boat against gave depositions in the ongoing Sandy Hook lawsuit

32
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:09,696
And

33
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:11,488
There's some interesting stuff in there

34
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:16,352
It low-key I think Rob dues might be the most interesting of the tree

35
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:23,264
I couldn't that's the surprising figure we go all right

36
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:26,336
That's the surprise of 2019

37
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:32,736
Rob dude his deposition was more interesting to me than Alex's

38
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:37,088
Get that out of business and talk a little bit about that

39
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:39,648
Boku signed up and recording the show

40
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:46,048
So first of all Caleb thank you so much

41
00:03:48,096 --> 00:03:54,240

Thank you very much do I need to Hook conspiracy next Josiah thank you so much

43
00:04:00,896 --> 00:04:07,040
Elliot

44
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:13,440
My favorite character

45
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:19,839
The show is it all close-up magic no it's all real

46
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:26,239
Terrible show but I love I like magic I love it whenever I'd be out at the bars doing shows and stuff until

47
00:04:26,495 --> 00:04:30,591
Summer walk up on the street while I'm smoking a cigarette want to do magic tricks

48
00:04:31,103 --> 00:04:37,247
My favorite second only to the next person who is assigned

49
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:41,599
Thank you so much Rachel you are now a technocrat

50
00:04:49,535 --> 00:04:53,375
Heroin

51
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:54,911
So good

52
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:58,239
Is freakishly large

53
00:04:58,495 --> 00:05:01,311
Thank you so much Rachel

54
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:07,455
Yes thank you very much Rachel if you're thinking

55
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:12,063
Gore website

56
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:16,671
So I was kind of struggling with trying to figure out exactly how we should

57
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:19,487
Do this episode cuz it's 3:00 deposition

58
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:26,143
You know and it seems a structure be weird I should we take intermissions redo it as separate episode

59
00:05:26,399 --> 00:05:32,287
Could do with a classic three-act structure much longer

60
00:05:32,543 --> 00:05:33,055
Alright

61
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:38,943
Broadway play

62
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:43,039
We will have third-act problems problems

63
00:05:43,295 --> 00:05:49,439
Bonita each of these depositions is really interesting to me and very different ways

64
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:55,839
To each of them you can predict with Alex's is

65
00:05:56,095 --> 00:06:02,239
Doesn't remember anything ever understand anything or nothing had anything to do with him not me

66
00:06:04,543 --> 00:06:06,847
But the other two have a very

67
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:08,639
Bizarre

68
00:06:08,895 --> 00:06:09,407
Kind of

69
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:17,087
Most through-line through them got something interesting going on Rob do visiting Fargo

70
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:17,855
More interesting

71
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:20,415
Don't let's start with the Paul Joseph Watson

72
00:06:20,671 --> 00:06:23,743
Okay he sits down and

73
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:27,327
I will say that I do not foresee a very clear on this

74
00:06:27,583 --> 00:06:28,607
I don't like Paul Joseph Watson

75
00:06:28,863 --> 00:06:29,631
Me neither

76
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:36,031
I find his voice Inseparable and his positions are nonsensical bordering on evil

77
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:42,431
I think he comes off like much more of a human has this deposition because I think that he has

78
00:06:42,687 --> 00:06:48,831
Some sort of a brand to protect a little bit and he doesn't want to

79
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:54,463
Comes off because there's one and that he does have

80
00:06:54,719 --> 00:07:00,863
The history of telling Alex to stop doing the Sandy Hook she does have that in his

81
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:04,703
That arrow is in his quiver that you can pull out be like

82
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:05,471
I try

83
00:07:05,727 --> 00:07:07,007
Look dude whatever

84
00:07:07,263 --> 00:07:08,287
So he has that

85
00:07:08,543 --> 00:07:09,567
MN 2nd

86
00:07:09,823 --> 00:07:13,151
He knows then he doesn't want to look like he's a f****** idiot

87
00:07:13,407 --> 00:07:15,711
You don't want to come off as like

88
00:07:15,967 --> 00:07:16,991
Alex

89
00:07:17,247 --> 00:07:23,391
Obfuscates everything is like I have no idea what my name is

90
00:07:23,647 --> 00:07:24,159
Look like that

91
00:07:24,671 --> 00:07:29,279
And so it creates an interesting Dynamic wear and I think a lot of people took these headlines

92
00:07:32,863 --> 00:07:39,007
He's turned on Alex

93
00:07:39,263 --> 00:07:45,407
Trying to defend out in in as much as you can while still being like my hands are clean I don't know you guys do what you're going to do

94
00:07:45,663 --> 00:07:47,455
Do without he's got a tough tightrope

95
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:53,855
Yeah I would say she's like a mid-level mafioso I don't express

96
00:07:54,111 --> 00:08:00,255
But it is a tough position where we learn

97
00:08:00,511 --> 00:08:01,279
DePaul

98
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:07,935
His never actually even been employed by Infowars for me every job

99
00:08:08,191 --> 00:08:09,471
Position U of L

100
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:13,567
Without Jones Infowars or Free Speech Systems LLC

101
00:08:14,591 --> 00:08:19,455
An unknown employee and have never been an employee so I haven't had to

102
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:21,247
Official job position

103
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:27,135
How would you describe your employment relationship in your working relationship with mr. John

104
00:08:27,647 --> 00:08:28,927
Contracted

105
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:31,231
This is interesting

106
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:35,071
Who's been there for 20 years

107
00:08:35,583 --> 00:08:40,191
Are you doing what what is I was going to pay insurance benefits of 401k

108
00:08:40,447 --> 00:08:46,591
I would certainly hope so for one of his longest you find that very difficult to believe

109
00:08:46,847 --> 00:08:49,919
Yeah I think it boots and weenies Underoath

110
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:51,711
That's why I was stupid

111
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:55,039
If there were very easily attainable records that he

112
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:58,367
Use employee that has been that stupid thing to say

113
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:00,159
But hey

114
00:09:00,415 --> 00:09:05,279
Yes I guess it like it is prowrestlingsheet

115
00:09:05,535 --> 00:09:10,399
Alex is Vince McMahon with all these independent contractors masquerading as employees

116
00:09:10,655 --> 00:09:13,215
I think it must be partially his

117
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:15,263
Kind of decision as well

118
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:18,079
You can't you can't be an independent contractor with somebody

119
00:09:18,335 --> 00:09:21,151
For twenty years and not at least have a conversation of like

120
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:30,367
You know maybe we should deal with actual labor laws today in the UK

121
00:09:30,623 --> 00:09:32,415
I make things a little difficult

122
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:38,815
Level of responsibility

123
00:09:39,071 --> 00:09:44,191
Had over the years I didn't forewarn editor-at-large rights

124
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:47,775
The bulk of the materials

125
00:09:48,287 --> 00:09:53,919
Like yeah he would have every negotiating chip available to him

126
00:09:54,175 --> 00:09:56,223
Give me an employee should he want to be

127
00:09:56,479 --> 00:09:59,551
I got maybe maybe there is like a mutually

128
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:01,087
Advantageous

129
00:10:01,343 --> 00:10:07,487
Reason for that I'm not entirely sure what it is but I thought that was pretty strange

130
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:10,559
We can't take each other

131
00:10:11,327 --> 00:10:14,911
You know that kind of thing like if you go down I am not going down with

132
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:21,567
Grandad that goes I both directions like something so f****** crazy that Alex would be able to

133
00:10:21,823 --> 00:10:22,335
The distance

134
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:24,127
You never actually worked

135
00:10:24,383 --> 00:10:25,151
I was just

136
00:10:25,663 --> 00:10:27,455
Which is stupid but

137
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:33,855
So as we know from listening back to the episodes of Infowars from that stretch of time after the shoot

138
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:40,255
Shooting at Sandy Hook we know that Paul Joseph Watson did interview Professor James Tracey

139
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:42,559
Of the crisis actors

140
00:10:42,815 --> 00:10:48,959
And put back a little it was muddy it was a little bit mixed in my

141
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:52,287
There was much

142
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:58,175
Lenience giving remember at the same time Paul did say I don't agree with these idea right

143
00:10:58,431 --> 00:11:04,575
Again like I said the Sinister phrase I did say I do

144
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:05,855
Don't believe that right

145
00:11:06,367 --> 00:11:10,719
So they played a little clip of that and this is really important because

146
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:13,279
What this does in terms of the questioning

147
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:14,047
Is

148
00:11:14,303 --> 00:11:14,815
2

149
00:11:15,071 --> 00:11:16,863
Explicitly layout

150
00:11:17,119 --> 00:11:20,191
Surly is like February 2013

151
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:25,311
Be polite Infowars world where that the parents and family members were being harassed

152
00:11:25,823 --> 00:11:28,127
The imams after Sandy book

153
00:11:28,383 --> 00:11:30,175
You were aware at this time

154
00:11:30,687 --> 00:11:35,551
30 parents were being harassed by Believers in the Sandy Hook conspiracy

155
00:11:38,367 --> 00:11:40,927
So that is that's demonstrated

156
00:11:41,183 --> 00:11:47,327
Yeah that's not good no good for the Outlook of Alex in this scenario in the clip that is played

157
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:48,095
Interviewing Tracy

158
00:11:48,351 --> 00:11:54,495
Even back then there's audio of Paul bringing up to James crazy that people are being harassed to there's a

159
00:11:55,007 --> 00:11:56,287
Large awareness of

160
00:11:56,543 --> 00:11:57,055
Oh yeah

161
00:11:57,823 --> 00:12:00,895
So also a back in the early days

162
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:03,711
Leonard Pozner sent an email

163
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:05,759
Infowars selling them hate

164
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:11,903
These people are harassing us and they need to be reeled in I used to be a fan of your show but I think

165
00:12:12,415 --> 00:12:15,743
Now I realize that a lot of these behaviors are being encouraged

166
00:12:17,535 --> 00:12:19,327
The response to that email

167
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:20,863
From Infowars

168
00:12:21,375 --> 00:12:23,679
Was apparently written by Paul Joseph Watson

169
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:25,215
Later

170
00:12:25,471 --> 00:12:27,775
Alex's deposition there'll be some

171
00:12:28,287 --> 00:12:31,103
Maybe insinuations that Alex wrote it with him

172
00:12:31,359 --> 00:12:32,895
But it's unclear

173
00:12:33,151 --> 00:12:33,663
There

174
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:36,479
In this deposition it's clear that Paul wrote it himself

175
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:39,807
Another stroller a response

176
00:12:40,063 --> 00:12:41,599
You remember writing this response

177
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:43,135
You bring back that memory

178
00:12:46,207 --> 00:12:49,023
No this is presented to yes I didn't recall it

179
00:12:49,535 --> 00:12:52,351
When you initially broil but yes

180
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:53,119
Sure

181
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:59,519
Now do you know did you do this on your own or was this a collaborative effort among other people Infowars.

182
00:12:59,775 --> 00:13:00,287
You remember that

183
00:13:00,799 --> 00:13:02,847
Dollars would it be me personally

184
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:03,615
Okay

185
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:06,687
So are you almost done

186
00:13:06,943 --> 00:13:12,063
No nobody else knows how to read there yeah

187
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:17,951
Defeated Seth hot pack with the rest of the guys by myself

188
00:13:18,463 --> 00:13:24,607
So now this is interesting here for one reason and that is that this would give Alex a little bit of plausible

189
00:13:24,863 --> 00:13:25,375
Deniability

190
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:32,031
Because the interview with James Tracey was done by Paul maybe I'll write a he never heard it he didn't know about

191
00:13:32,287 --> 00:13:38,431
How to talk about the grass and the parents got that email I wrote

192
00:13:38,687 --> 00:13:41,759
Go back to the guy maybe Alex can pretend he never saw that

193
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:44,063
Steve Alex Cruz that up later

194
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:48,927
So what are the things that the lawyers Sea-Doo watercraft on is like

195
00:13:49,439 --> 00:13:49,951
Guys

196
00:13:50,207 --> 00:13:52,255
You really think that what you did was okay

197
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:58,655
Do you think that would Infowars engage did was alright

198
00:13:58,911 --> 00:14:05,055
To ask people if they actually have morality at all do you have no decency soap all is ask that

199
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:09,151
Any tries to wiggle out of giving a yes or no answer

200
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:11,455
But in terms of

201
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:15,551
What you think is decent and right in terms of covering the story

202
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:20,671
You think Infowars always adhere to what is decent and right coming the store

203
00:14:22,207 --> 00:14:23,999
Subjective

204
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:27,327
From us

205
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:30,143
From my personal perspective

206
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:33,471
Decent and ride

207
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:35,775
I would not have covered it in that way now

208
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:42,687
So that is pretty that I think is where you could say like he's throwing Alex under the bus

209
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:43,711
That would be the only one

210
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:47,551
To be fair that Paul like what position is he in

211
00:14:47,807 --> 00:14:53,951
We have no reason to go to bed we like everything was just fine I told them to cut it out

212
00:14:54,975 --> 00:15:01,119
No I with the gift of hindsight realizing how I say was decent

213
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:04,191
That's a beautiful opportunity

214
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:07,775
Because I think I would want that question to them be broadened

215
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:08,799
I've just like

216
00:15:09,311 --> 00:15:09,823
Do you think

217
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:12,895
Anything you've done they're teasing and rights

218
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:14,175
I think I think

219
00:15:14,687 --> 00:15:15,455
If you're talkin

220
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:18,015
Paul Joseph Watson and he's being

221
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:19,295
This sort of

222
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:22,623
Bear yeah yeah you don't want to jeopardize

223
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:29,023
I don't know I want to shoot the s*** with it see what's going on today that the lawyers would be wise to not turn this

224
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:31,839
Adversarial

225
00:15:32,095 --> 00:15:34,399
Candid enough with his answers

226
00:15:34,655 --> 00:15:39,007
That like why why fight with this British guy when

227
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:40,799
We might be able to get some

228
00:15:41,055 --> 00:15:41,823
Piece of information

229
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:48,479
Appreciate Paul more when he's not able to edit his annoying voice together another

230
00:15:48,735 --> 00:15:49,759
Tubac nightmarish

231
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:52,831
Hellscape yeah it does make him seem more human

232
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:54,879
So the big

233
00:15:55,135 --> 00:15:57,695
I think one of the big revelation

234
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:01,279
Is in Discovery Alex sent over all these

235
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:02,815
From Infowars

236
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:05,375
And the lawyers have gone through them

237
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:07,423
I want to do emails they found

238
00:16:07,679 --> 00:16:09,215
Wasn't email DePaul Center

239
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:10,239
Do Buckley

240
00:16:10,495 --> 00:16:12,031
And Anthony gucciardi

241
00:16:12,287 --> 00:16:18,431
We were apparently in managerial roles can I get you to drop some tunes at my next

242
00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:25,087
Oh that is not there that might be another email

243
00:16:25,343 --> 00:16:26,111
Miss email

244
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:30,207
Paul is telling them what he has told Alec

245
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:36,095
He is texted Alex a message and sending it to them in order to

246
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:37,887
Have it on the record

247
00:16:38,143 --> 00:16:40,191
Call whatever

248
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:43,775
This out here to show you another document now

249
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:47,359
And I would like to show you an email

250
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:49,151
That Euston

251
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:52,223
In 2015 on December 17th

252
00:16:52,991 --> 00:16:54,783
So we got a 2015

253
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:58,367
December 17th email that was sent to these dudes

254
00:16:58,879 --> 00:17:02,207
Here is what email

255
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:06,815
I think that this is where we get into like a real interesting

256
00:17:07,071 --> 00:17:09,119
Seesaw kind of situation of like

257
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:11,167
Is this a good email

258
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:13,471
We'll see

259
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:16,031
I want to read what you said to Alice

260
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:19,871
This Sandy Hook stuff is killing us

261
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:26,783
Is promoted by the most batshit crazy people like Rim inspector who all hate

262
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:27,551
Citizen Way

263
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:34,207
Plus it makes us look really bad to align with people who last the parents of dead kids

264
00:17:34,719 --> 00:17:36,511
It's going to hurt us with Drudge

265
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:38,815
And bringing bigger names into the show

266
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:41,887
Plus the event happened 3 years ago

267
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:44,703
Why even risk her reputation for it

268
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:48,031
My first question is

269
00:17:49,055 --> 00:17:51,359
Let's first talk about who Jeff the rents is

270
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:52,639
Nwbo

271
00:17:54,175 --> 00:17:56,223
Jeff rims is a

272
00:17:58,015 --> 00:18:00,319
Notoriously unreliable

273
00:18:01,087 --> 00:18:04,671
Conspiracy theorists and rabid anti-semite correct

274
00:18:09,535 --> 00:18:15,679
I'm not in school in the Rabid anti-semite but I would say

275
00:18:17,215 --> 00:18:23,359
That's that's kind of a consistent thread throughout this is like the Heap. They keep asking about Visa

276
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:26,431
Jim Fetzer you know this guy is a

277
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:32,831
Deeply abuse Medicare

278
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:39,999
The reason I think that email is a seesaw is because on the one hand you have Paul saying we got to cut the s*** out

279
00:18:40,255 --> 00:18:41,023
Which is good

280
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:44,607
Because the end result of that would be stopping the behavior

281
00:18:44,863 --> 00:18:46,911
Yeah on the other side of the seesaw

282
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:53,311
It doesn't seem to come from a place of concern or this is wrong right it seems like well Drudge

283
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:59,711
Like us so much Ryan we won't be able to get big S2 because we're engaging in this kind of bulshit rice

284
00:18:59,967 --> 00:19:01,247
Know how I feel about that

285
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:02,783
I knew you'd be like

286
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:08,415
Fox News canceling Tucker Carlson Carlson show because all of the advertisers dropped

287
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:09,695
You know it's like

288
00:19:10,207 --> 00:19:16,095
You guys let this white to clear white nationalist white supremacist run on your network unabated

289
00:19:16,351 --> 00:19:22,495
However long in the only reason you're stopping if it's because of appearances and money I miss you there is that

290
00:19:22,751 --> 00:19:26,335
Sort of sentences like doing the right thing for the wrong reason and I

291
00:19:26,847 --> 00:19:32,991
I still applaud like his ability to speak this yeah yeah

292
00:19:33,247 --> 00:19:39,391
Do you know there is some voice there that's like we shouldn't be doing this I just wish it came from a place of

293
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:46,815
Reason to not want to do this cuz it doesn't fly that like if these things were so concerned I wouldn't have

294
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:47,583
The problem with

295
00:19:48,095 --> 00:19:53,215
Yeah that may be the case this is probably the best we're going to get from

296
00:19:54,239 --> 00:20:00,383
Probably you know although it does also introduce another strange Dynamic and that is it that is a voice

297
00:20:00,639 --> 00:20:06,783
It's there you don't really think about that the possibility that I didn't forward there is some $0.02 and they

298
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,575
They still do what they do

299
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:10,879
Scarier

300
00:20:11,135 --> 00:20:16,511
That is a good question because we talked a bunch about how it's like shouldn't there be somebody they're going Alex

301
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:18,303
Don't f****** do this

302
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:24,703
And it's clear there are people there saying Alex maybe not all the time no probably not

303
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:26,751
Control himself I don't think that

304
00:20:27,263 --> 00:20:29,055
Like just going based off this

305
00:20:29,311 --> 00:20:31,615
Genuinely think Alex

306
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:34,431
Would listen to edit the same time

307
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:36,479
Not be able to control himself

308
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:37,247
On the air

309
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:38,783
Yeah and wind up just

310
00:20:39,295 --> 00:20:45,439
Saying that dumped one of the problems of his sort of improvisational Style

311
00:20:45,695 --> 00:20:48,255
It will lead you to some places where you like

312
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:51,071
It's not doing not doing it

313
00:20:51,327 --> 00:20:57,471
In the email Paul Joseph Watson says the Jeff rense and Jim Fetzer Arbor

314
00:20:57,727 --> 00:20:58,751
Batshit crazy

315
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:03,359
Now that's about Ukraine

316
00:21:03,615 --> 00:21:09,759
This opens up the possibility for this lawyer to put Paul in a little bit of a trap

317
00:21:10,015 --> 00:21:14,623
They say he doesn't see you he's real to be a checkmate

318
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:16,672
Show me how you came to the conclusion

319
00:21:16,928 --> 00:21:20,000
Got these two gentlemen the Infowars was relying on

320
00:21:20,256 --> 00:21:22,048
You're batshit crazy

321
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:28,704
Because they were pushing

322
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:32,288
The notion that nobody died at Sandy Hook which I felt was

323
00:21:32,544 --> 00:21:37,920
Not writable immersible albino evidence so that fall was a crazy conclusion to make

324
00:21:38,688 --> 00:21:40,992
Alex Jones

325
00:21:41,248 --> 00:21:42,784
Equally batshit crazy

326
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:49,184
I wouldn't describe it as batshit crazy

327
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:51,744
What kind of crazy

328
00:21:54,816 --> 00:21:56,864
I would describe it as him

329
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:03,264
Commenting on the controversy of the conspiracy theories that were swirling about Sandy Hook of the time

330
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:09,664
That that's going to be also a sort of refrain is like we were covering what was happening

331
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:11,712
Kind of

332
00:22:11,968 --> 00:22:15,808
I think when you consider their actual behavior is that

333
00:22:16,064 --> 00:22:20,672
The side isn't very strong now it doesn't seem like a really great legal arguments

334
00:22:21,184 --> 00:22:24,000
But I do I love that I love that okay

335
00:22:24,256 --> 00:22:25,280
Why are they crazy

336
00:22:25,536 --> 00:22:28,096
Ex Behavior Alex does X also

337
00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:37,056
I do like this is in an echoey room because I don't know if anything has ever run more Hollow than his

338
00:22:37,312 --> 00:22:39,104
I think he's just

339
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:43,456
Covering the controversy like you can thank for that

340
00:22:43,712 --> 00:22:47,040
You're calling in from Jolly Old London

341
00:22:47,552 --> 00:22:53,696
So they put her on this question of like why is this behavior in damn crazy and not Alex

342
00:22:53,952 --> 00:22:59,584
And I don't know if the PJ dubs is is convinced me that there's a difference

343
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:04,448
Okay so just rinse or Jim Fetzer start pushing allegation

344
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,240
But the children aren't real

345
00:23:06,496 --> 00:23:08,288
At the parents are fake

346
00:23:08,544 --> 00:23:10,848
Let the crying dog shaking and throwing up

347
00:23:11,616 --> 00:23:12,896
You're batshit crazy

348
00:23:13,152 --> 00:23:17,760
But if Joan says literally the exact same words on this telephone web broadcast

349
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:20,576
He's just doing a good job as a girl

350
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,368
Well

351
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:27,488
Taconic combine this with your previous question I would say

352
00:23:28,256 --> 00:23:32,352
Description of them as batshit-crazy would also involve

353
00:23:34,656 --> 00:23:39,008
Things that I've said in the past unrelated to Sandy Hook maybe about

354
00:23:40,032 --> 00:23:42,592
You assholes all alien abduction or

355
00:23:43,104 --> 00:23:46,176
Holograms on 9/11

356
00:23:46,432 --> 00:23:48,224
Big thing for awhile so

357
00:23:48,992 --> 00:23:55,136
They have they had a previous has engaging in very obscure can spare

358
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:59,232
Description of that she crazy

359
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,584
Can you think that their history of doing that as any different than Alex Jones

360
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,192
Buck

361
00:24:08,448 --> 00:24:11,008
What do I say what do I say

362
00:24:11,264 --> 00:24:12,544
No but again

363
00:24:13,824 --> 00:24:17,152
Speech under the First Amendment

364
00:24:17,408 --> 00:24:23,552
I'm not this point I'm not asking you if you had the right to do what we're we'll all figure that out

365
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:25,600
What I'm asking you is

366
00:24:25,856 --> 00:24:31,232
Alex Jones and it's crazy conspiracy about Shadow interdimensional government

367
00:24:31,488 --> 00:24:33,792
And alien fish hybrid

368
00:24:34,048 --> 00:24:36,608
Things like this

369
00:24:36,864 --> 00:24:42,752
Especially with no difference in how they cover conspiracy theory

370
00:24:45,312 --> 00:24:49,152
That's your view I wouldn't necessarily agree with it

371
00:24:51,968 --> 00:24:54,016
People like rinse and fats are bad

372
00:24:54,528 --> 00:24:56,576
Mr. Jones not in the same way

373
00:25:02,464 --> 00:25:04,512
I would say no in the same way because

374
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:08,352
Alex was covering the controversy

375
00:25:08,608 --> 00:25:11,936
Sure buddy you get the get the same

376
00:25:12,192 --> 00:25:13,984
Alright so I think that

377
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,544
What you have there is

378
00:25:17,056 --> 00:25:19,616
Absolutely evidence of

379
00:25:20,384 --> 00:25:22,432
I don't have a good answer for this

380
00:25:22,688 --> 00:25:28,832
He thought he was he thought he was so smart when he gave that first answer of like well because they said that Sandy Hook was

381
00:25:29,088 --> 00:25:35,232
Was crazy that you got this follow-up questions like s*** I should have said that everything else they said with f***

382
00:25:35,488 --> 00:25:41,632
Crazy if you like if I'm working for Alex Jones

383
00:25:41,888 --> 00:25:44,960
Tractor whatever the case is and I'm getting deposed

384
00:25:45,472 --> 00:25:51,616
I might come up with a reason why Alex isn't the same as the other people who lie about Sandy Hook

385
00:25:52,128 --> 00:25:53,920
I feel like that's just something

386
00:25:54,176 --> 00:25:56,224
Probably could expect Mike come up

387
00:25:56,992 --> 00:26:00,320
Doesn't seem like there's any preparation here

388
00:26:00,576 --> 00:26:01,088
You know

389
00:26:01,344 --> 00:26:07,488
This reminds me because I was just thinking the exact same thing I was just thinking that their brand of crazy cannot survive

390
00:26:07,744 --> 00:26:13,888
Underoath situation with somebody who is prepared to

391
00:26:14,144 --> 00:26:17,472
More less such that psychopath of like

392
00:26:17,728 --> 00:26:20,032
No matter what I'm the smartest guy in the room

393
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:25,920
You know I don't need to prepare I don't need to do anything yet I'm going to outsmart this no big deal

394
00:26:26,176 --> 00:26:31,808
Yeah like it that I'm not sure if Paul is 100% on that tip

395
00:26:32,064 --> 00:26:35,136
Because I think he is still being agreeable and

396
00:26:35,392 --> 00:26:41,536
I do see some indications that he might have checked his emails that he had written in their ass

397
00:26:41,792 --> 00:26:45,888
Yeah that kind of thing to know what might come up but the fact that there's no

398
00:26:46,144 --> 00:26:52,288
Good answer for salt like why is this person different than other conspiracy theory like you've worked for him for

399
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:53,312
20 years yeah

400
00:26:53,568 --> 00:26:55,360
That indicates to me a lack of

401
00:26:55,616 --> 00:26:59,200
Care or concern about it like defending yourself or like

402
00:26:59,456 --> 00:27:00,736
It just feels like

403
00:27:00,992 --> 00:27:04,320
It's a tacit admission that you're not any different

404
00:27:04,832 --> 00:27:06,624
Well I re-up I think

405
00:27:07,136 --> 00:27:12,256
I'm surprised that he doesn't have a stock answer because it was like that would come up in a normal

406
00:27:12,512 --> 00:27:18,400
Any interview yeah

407
00:27:18,656 --> 00:27:24,800
You know the conversation hundred times of your life

408
00:27:25,056 --> 00:27:31,200
Skip this one cuz it's just the lawyer pointing out that Paul was right about Sandy

409
00:27:31,456 --> 00:27:33,248
Alex didn't listen to him

410
00:27:34,784 --> 00:27:36,320
It's true that FairPoint

411
00:27:36,832 --> 00:27:38,368
That's coming up

412
00:27:38,624 --> 00:27:42,208
The lawyers asking Paul about an email exchange that he had with Buckley

413
00:27:42,464 --> 00:27:47,840
Again is a manager person every house DJ and Alex's cousin

414
00:27:48,352 --> 00:27:52,704
So Paul is received an email from quantcast the website ranking

415
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:57,824
This email was to inform the Infowars it seen a large surgeon traffic recently

416
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:03,968
And as a matter of policy that make quadcast who could have put a temporary hold on ranking Infowars in their charts

417
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:10,624
They build that they are they building these protocols so people can't easily mess with their website rankings automated traffic

418
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:14,976
Just a standard procedure thing yeah it's more effective than our f****** voting machines

419
00:28:15,232 --> 00:28:19,584
So Paul sent this email to Buckley you forwards it on who replies to him

420
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,376
And that's where this clips.

421
00:28:21,888 --> 00:28:23,680
When you sent this email

422
00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:25,216
Buckley m Joe

423
00:28:25,728 --> 00:28:27,520
And I want to read it to you okay

424
00:28:28,288 --> 00:28:29,312
Ted

425
00:28:29,824 --> 00:28:30,848
But no

426
00:28:31,104 --> 00:28:33,408
Surely it's a conspiracy theory

427
00:28:33,664 --> 00:28:36,224
But they are trying to suppress our popularity

428
00:28:36,736 --> 00:28:37,504
Do that

429
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:39,040
Lizard people

430
00:28:39,552 --> 00:28:42,624
In return to the Ascension pad at Sandy Hook

431
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:45,696
On sacrifice crisis actors

432
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,768
Here is making a joke

433
00:28:49,024 --> 00:28:51,328
About the craziness of the series is it

434
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,704
You have to have to ask Buckley

435
00:28:58,496 --> 00:28:59,008
Smooth

436
00:28:59,264 --> 00:29:00,800
When you eat an email

437
00:29:01,056 --> 00:29:02,336
In your day-to-day business

438
00:29:02,592 --> 00:29:04,640
Let's talking about lizard people

439
00:29:04,896 --> 00:29:10,016
Going to the Ascension at Sandy Hook and feasting on sacrifice prices doctors

440
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,880
Why don't you say I would presume that is dark humor

441
00:29:15,392 --> 00:29:15,904
Dark humor

442
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:22,560
This is a very important line of attack that I think the lawyers are going on here I think it signals a really good strategy

443
00:29:23,072 --> 00:29:29,216
See what this email tends to demonstrate is it people behind the scenes at Infowars had an awareness that the things that they were saying

444
00:29:29,472 --> 00:29:31,520
Publicly about Sandy Hook were not true

445
00:29:32,032 --> 00:29:38,176
This email joke it offers a glimpse into the way that the tragedy was being discussed internally by people

446
00:29:38,432 --> 00:29:38,944
Mike Buckley

447
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:44,064
Who's someone who like I said was in a managerial role and is related directly to Alex

448
00:29:44,576 --> 00:29:50,720
He's obviously joking about this thing with podcast being conspiracy against them and the use of Crisis actors at Sandy Hook as

449
00:29:50,976 --> 00:29:53,024
Is the outrageous example in the joke

450
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:57,376
Imply that he considers it an instance of something that is mockable

451
00:29:58,144 --> 00:30:02,752
What are the reasons that this is such an excellent line of approaches because the lawyers are able to combine

452
00:30:03,008 --> 00:30:06,592
Private information they founded Discovery with public statements

453
00:30:06,848 --> 00:30:08,384
And sometimes when you do that

454
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,920
You find something damning

455
00:30:10,176 --> 00:30:10,944
Like his disgust

456
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:12,224
In this next clip

457
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:15,808
Were you aware that mr. Jones just a few hours earlier

458
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:19,392
I've been on Infowars accusing the parents of being actors

459
00:30:23,744 --> 00:30:28,864
But I don't think I joked about crisis actors in the email Wilson that Buckley the

460
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:32,192
Use the same crisis actors

461
00:30:33,472 --> 00:30:35,264
Okay let's rephrase the question

462
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:39,616
Were you aware that in that email that you said you were having a Buckley

463
00:30:39,872 --> 00:30:42,688
Where he joked to you about crisis actors

464
00:30:42,944 --> 00:30:45,248
The outlandish nature crisis.

465
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:51,904
But that same time 2 hours earlier Mr Jones was on his show at using Advanced Pediatrics

466
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:53,184
Are you wearing

467
00:30:55,488 --> 00:30:57,024
How do you feel about that

468
00:30:59,072 --> 00:31:00,096
Popular use

469
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,168
Completely inaccurate in my cannot claim

470
00:31:05,984 --> 00:31:07,264
Not something you're proud of

471
00:31:10,592 --> 00:31:12,384
It's not something I said so

472
00:31:13,152 --> 00:31:19,296
This is also the problem with the sincerity that Paul is kind of throw it out a little bit he allows himself to be put into

473
00:31:19,552 --> 00:31:25,696
Situations where there is no other answer than that sucks

474
00:31:25,952 --> 00:31:32,096
The same day a manager Infowars who's related to Alex with privately mocking Sandy Hook conspiracy

475
00:31:32,352 --> 00:31:35,936
Simultaneously Alex was promoting them on his show

476
00:31:36,448 --> 00:31:41,312
It goes a really long way towards building the case these people knew that what they were saying wasn't true

477
00:31:41,824 --> 00:31:47,968
Earlier in the deposition it was established that at least Paul was completely aware as early as the beginning of 2013 that the fan

478
00:31:48,224 --> 00:31:51,296
Families of the victims are being harassed by people who believed these theories

479
00:31:51,552 --> 00:31:56,416
Which implies that the argument that they didn't know the consequences of their coverage probably not true

480
00:31:56,928 --> 00:32:02,304
And here you have a little glimpse of the behind-the-scenes vibe that really seems to suggest that people in forwards were aware

481
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:05,120
The information they were Aaron was worth mocking

482
00:32:05,376 --> 00:32:06,912
Which is to say not true

483
00:32:07,424 --> 00:32:10,240
The pieces to come together out of this look really really bad

484
00:32:10,752 --> 00:32:16,128
Considering this is not even close to all the information plaintiffs are working with it really seems like Alex's

485
00:32:16,384 --> 00:32:22,528
Probably in some serious trouble when this is all said and done I honestly think is probably played playing this

486
00:32:22,784 --> 00:32:23,552
Almost exactly like you should

487
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:28,672
I don't think he has any liability in this Infowars goes away he's still a star

488
00:32:28,928 --> 00:32:35,072
He can he can he can maneuver his way around this a little bit even any contracts to rip up

489
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:38,912
Now

490
00:32:39,168 --> 00:32:40,448
Here's what's interesting

491
00:32:41,984 --> 00:32:46,592
I know that it came out we discuss this and we'll play a clip of it Alex saying this later but

492
00:32:46,848 --> 00:32:52,992
Robert Barnes is not in these deposition you can tell because no one's yelling objection every

493
00:32:55,552 --> 00:32:58,112
So he is no longer Alex's lawyer

494
00:32:58,368 --> 00:33:04,000
Which confirms in this testimony that he doesn't work at Infowars in any capacity

495
00:33:04,256 --> 00:33:06,304
He is no longer involved with them at all

496
00:33:07,072 --> 00:33:08,352
What about Paul

497
00:33:08,608 --> 00:33:09,888
Mr. Watson

498
00:33:10,144 --> 00:33:13,216
Can you tell me what you did to prepare for your deposition specs

499
00:33:15,008 --> 00:33:19,872
I spoke to Robert Bones on by Jeffries

500
00:33:20,896 --> 00:33:22,432
Okay you review any documents

501
00:33:27,552 --> 00:33:29,088
When did you speak with your counsel

502
00:33:32,928 --> 00:33:33,440
Gherkin

503
00:33:33,696 --> 00:33:36,768
Sunday evening my time and

504
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:38,560
This afternoon today

505
00:33:39,072 --> 00:33:41,376
The way Jeffries is Alex's lawyer

506
00:33:41,632 --> 00:33:46,240
Is that now the person who you'll hear it saying objection to Alex's

507
00:33:46,496 --> 00:33:48,032
Yeah not nearly as much as Barn

508
00:33:48,288 --> 00:33:49,824
Right but he's probably a better lawyer

509
00:33:50,336 --> 00:33:56,480
These depositions are happening at about the same time these were over the course of two days at the end of November

510
00:33:56,736 --> 00:33:57,760
26th and 27th

511
00:33:58,784 --> 00:34:02,112
And so Barnes is still somehow in the mix for Paul

512
00:34:02,368 --> 00:34:03,648
But not for Infowars

513
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:10,304
Which I find interesting I don't know what it means it made me nothing but it could mean something

514
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:13,120
Very interesting

515
00:34:13,888 --> 00:34:14,912
Here's my pitch

516
00:34:15,680 --> 00:34:16,960
Alright this is a

517
00:34:17,216 --> 00:34:17,984
Personal thing

518
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:20,544
What happened between Jones and Bar

519
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:26,432
A hundred percent believe nothing that happened between we have

520
00:34:26,688 --> 00:34:32,832
Here's what I'm going to go I don't go it

521
00:34:33,088 --> 00:34:39,232
Telguard might realize that Barnes was trying to take over

522
00:34:39,488 --> 00:34:45,632
That's my theory that is my theory I think we sow Discord amongst

523
00:34:45,888 --> 00:34:52,032
I don't think I don't I don't think there's any likelihood that's true but I do

524
00:34:52,288 --> 00:34:54,336
I will go as far with USA

525
00:34:54,848 --> 00:35:00,992
I would believe it something personal 100% more than any kind of business

526
00:35:01,248 --> 00:35:02,272
Issue that

527
00:35:02,528 --> 00:35:07,648
Either that or he couldn't afford parts that could be even though he was working at

528
00:35:07,904 --> 00:35:08,928
Almost profile.

529
00:35:09,184 --> 00:35:10,720
For exposure

530
00:35:11,232 --> 00:35:13,536
Paul you kind of

531
00:35:14,816 --> 00:35:17,120
Making a stock defense of

532
00:35:17,376 --> 00:35:23,008
All these behaviors all this stuff like we have

533
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,824
You know just the first amendment in all this

534
00:35:26,336 --> 00:35:27,872
Intubate ask him

535
00:35:28,384 --> 00:35:34,528
Education in the fetal Ono when it comes to what is or is not allowed

536
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:36,832
You really don't have to call

537
00:35:39,392 --> 00:35:45,536
No laws what I do is related to free speech so although I don't know

538
00:35:45,792 --> 00:35:48,352
Academic qualifications I would

539
00:35:48,608 --> 00:35:50,400
Do you like to consider

540
00:35:50,656 --> 00:35:52,192
Reasonably good grasp

541
00:35:53,216 --> 00:35:59,360
That to me is not the answer like I've studied it extensively not in a formal setting

542
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:05,760
You know I'm aware of these various Supreme Court rulings of limitations

543
00:36:06,016 --> 00:36:07,808
Not Nuance to that there's just like

544
00:36:08,064 --> 00:36:13,696
I work in sort of this Fringe area where we yelled at Free Speech Bunch so I'm kind of

545
00:36:13,952 --> 00:36:16,256
Intimately involved in it

546
00:36:16,512 --> 00:36:20,608
I like to say things that anger people

547
00:36:20,864 --> 00:36:25,472
It seems like he's really taking the idea of

548
00:36:25,728 --> 00:36:29,312
Free speeches whatever I kind of personally Define it as too hard

549
00:36:29,568 --> 00:36:31,872
Yeah so far is he doesn't have to know what it

550
00:36:32,128 --> 00:36:32,896
Is legally

551
00:36:33,408 --> 00:36:35,968
I don't have much of a different perception

552
00:36:36,224 --> 00:36:42,368
After listening but I don't know I don't know I would be interested I would be surprised

553
00:36:43,648 --> 00:36:44,672
Done

554
00:36:44,928 --> 00:36:45,952
Reading on the subject

555
00:36:46,464 --> 00:36:49,024
But I do here I don't hear it from the the answer

556
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:53,888
Almost it's almost more it almost makes more sense to not look into it

557
00:36:54,400 --> 00:37:00,544
It's so that your ability arguments about what free speech is can never be clouded

558
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:03,104
Incidental knowledge that it actually

559
00:37:04,384 --> 00:37:05,408
Yeah yeah

560
00:37:05,664 --> 00:37:10,016
Another thing that's a big defense is that Alex isn't a journalist

561
00:37:10,784 --> 00:37:16,928
Right that is going to be something that you hear a bit like this is just okay

562
00:37:17,952 --> 00:37:19,744
Alex is doing is a pedia

563
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,048
If you have somebody of a track record

564
00:37:22,304 --> 00:37:24,864
Being batshit-crazy unreliable

565
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:27,936
Violate the Simpsons journalistic integrity

566
00:37:28,192 --> 00:37:30,240
What they are saying as fact

567
00:37:30,752 --> 00:37:31,264
Direct

568
00:37:33,312 --> 00:37:36,128
If you were a journalistic

569
00:37:36,384 --> 00:37:39,200
Middle-of-the-road non-porous is unknown commentary

570
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:42,272
Machado

571
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,832
So Alex Jones is allowed to do

572
00:37:45,856 --> 00:37:49,440
Other other people who claim to be journalist aunt but Alex Jones

573
00:37:50,976 --> 00:37:53,792
Underground journalistic ethic ethics

574
00:37:55,328 --> 00:37:56,864
Alex Jones

575
00:37:57,376 --> 00:37:59,168
Would because he's an opinion

576
00:37:59,424 --> 00:38:00,448
Commentator

577
00:38:01,216 --> 00:38:03,520
And he has no journalistic

578
00:38:04,288 --> 00:38:09,408
Well you don't judge me so now he's not he doesn't abide by those ethics because he's not a journalist

579
00:38:10,432 --> 00:38:11,200
Text restore

580
00:38:11,456 --> 00:38:14,784
This opens up a pretty interesting

581
00:38:15,296 --> 00:38:15,808
Vista

582
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:21,440
Because once you're doing that once you're like yeah he's just this is all just a pinion

583
00:38:21,952 --> 00:38:23,232
Now it becomes

584
00:38:23,744 --> 00:38:29,888
Pretty important to nail down what's the what's the difference between opinion and

585
00:38:30,144 --> 00:38:34,752
Back and this is something that is going to be a little bit of a muddy

586
00:38:35,008 --> 00:38:35,776
Problem

587
00:38:36,032 --> 00:38:39,872
For both Paul and Alex when they're deposition

588
00:38:40,128 --> 00:38:43,200
Neither of them seems to really understand

589
00:38:43,456 --> 00:38:47,808
The different crystalline fashion the difference

590
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:50,624
Here is Paul trying to walk that line

591
00:38:54,464 --> 00:38:59,328
Indians versus assertion

592
00:39:04,704 --> 00:39:06,496
An opinion is your viewpoint

593
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:14,944
Max's already subjected unfortunately in warm side has a set of facts which

594
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:15,712
Patreon

595
00:39:15,968 --> 00:39:18,528
Neither side has it said facts which they agree on

596
00:39:18,784 --> 00:39:22,368
So it's a very vague Concepts in 2019

597
00:39:23,392 --> 00:39:29,536
You cannot have an opinion on facts that skews one way or the other so it's very difficult Iris

598
00:39:33,888 --> 00:39:35,936
Will you degree there are there certain thing

599
00:39:36,448 --> 00:39:37,984
Like if I was to say

600
00:39:39,776 --> 00:39:41,056
This person is Butte

601
00:39:41,824 --> 00:39:47,968
That's subjective it can't be proven ascertainable e true or false

602
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,296
It's something like

603
00:39:51,808 --> 00:39:55,136
The Sandy Hook school was not an operating school

604
00:39:55,904 --> 00:39:57,184
That can be proven

605
00:39:57,696 --> 00:39:58,464
Sure

606
00:40:03,072 --> 00:40:05,632
BarkBox toys I bought

607
00:40:05,888 --> 00:40:12,032
They can be proven but it's in based on whether you believe the proof that's presented mean

608
00:40:12,288 --> 00:40:18,432
Jesus that should be on humanities gravestone

609
00:40:18,688 --> 00:40:24,064
Well I mean it's I guess if you have to say some

610
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:30,464
Something

611
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:33,536
In those sort of under pressure valve

612
00:40:33,792 --> 00:40:39,936
That's really sad about your opinion on that

613
00:40:40,448 --> 00:40:46,592
What is it infects don't exist but that is basically the underlying class Fair

614
00:40:46,848 --> 00:40:51,456
Do you say one side has their fax the other side has their facts and they're at odds

615
00:40:51,712 --> 00:40:54,528
Yes that is a denial of reality and that is

616
00:40:54,784 --> 00:40:58,112
Grab that is stuff that makes it tough

617
00:40:58,368 --> 00:41:00,160
To imagine

618
00:41:00,416 --> 00:41:05,792
Because that everything is the domain of opinion there's no responsibility for anything there's no

619
00:41:06,048 --> 00:41:11,168
There's no reason to get anything right just f****** do whatever you want to do that that's

620
00:41:11,424 --> 00:41:13,728
Makes me really bomb I mean that is really f******

621
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:20,384
I thought he would say it's like it's like Lindsey Graham

622
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:21,920
Oh this is The Darkest Timeline

623
00:41:22,176 --> 00:41:23,456
That you're just saying that

624
00:41:26,272 --> 00:41:31,392
Look because they're just opinion so right over it Infowars and also all reality

625
00:41:31,648 --> 00:41:35,744
They should be held to a lower standard than people who

626
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:41,376
Are foolish enough to believe that exist

627
00:41:41,632 --> 00:41:45,984
Paul expresses that they should be held to a lower standard

628
00:41:46,496 --> 00:41:48,800
Infowars does something like that

629
00:41:49,312 --> 00:41:51,104
Text evidence and makes a jumping

630
00:41:51,616 --> 00:41:53,919
Is it a responsibility to be accurate

631
00:41:57,503 --> 00:41:59,295
In the context of opinion

632
00:41:59,551 --> 00:42:00,319
Common tree

633
00:42:02,111 --> 00:42:04,159
I mean you could save as a

634
00:42:05,951 --> 00:42:08,767
Yeah you should strive to be accurate but insensitive

635
00:42:09,279 --> 00:42:14,143
Banana journalistic ethics bowl game

636
00:42:14,911 --> 00:42:21,055
Based on whether they are opinion Coventry oil down the line journalism

637
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:25,919
You should be able to a lower standard than perhaps other media organization

638
00:42:26,175 --> 00:42:26,943
Butchered

639
00:42:31,039 --> 00:42:31,551
Wolf

640
00:42:31,807 --> 00:42:33,087
That's not good

641
00:42:33,343 --> 00:42:36,927
Shoot for the stars strived to tell

642
00:42:37,183 --> 00:42:40,511
Screw things up but you know if you lie all the time

643
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:42,303
That's fine too

644
00:42:42,815 --> 00:42:45,375
That's brutal one of the

645
00:42:45,887 --> 00:42:49,983
Confounding things that just seems to be completely lost on

646
00:42:50,239 --> 00:42:52,287
All of these three people being deposed

647
00:42:52,543 --> 00:42:53,055
Is

648
00:42:53,567 --> 00:42:59,711
How is the audience supposed to determine what is opinion and what is being presented as fact if opinion is presented as fact

649
00:42:59,967 --> 00:43:03,807
Wright's what is the what is the differentiation between

650
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:06,111
This is just something that

651
00:43:06,367 --> 00:43:08,927
Well they

652
00:43:09,439 --> 00:43:12,511
Use their discernment whenever you

653
00:43:12,767 --> 00:43:14,303
Opinions

654
00:43:14,559 --> 00:43:20,703
And then you say it's in the white paper or it's all been proven right it came out in court document right

655
00:43:20,959 --> 00:43:27,103
Whenever you use those things to reinforce your opinion in fact

656
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:33,503
Drive to say that things are in the white papers of favor

657
00:43:33,759 --> 00:43:35,551
Play papers you shouldn't be held to that

658
00:43:35,807 --> 00:43:37,599
It's just it's just interesting

659
00:43:38,111 --> 00:43:42,463
Play white paper bananas

660
00:43:42,975 --> 00:43:43,999
Yeah so

661
00:43:44,767 --> 00:43:46,303
That doesn't get resolved

662
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:52,703
At all really like I don't really think the Paul's testimony is really all that

663
00:43:52,959 --> 00:43:59,103
Except for the part where you get into that Buckley email

664
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:04,735
Yeah and also there's a bit of a conversation that Buckley attached a meme

665
00:44:04,991 --> 00:44:10,111
Do the email joke back it's like a 4chan meme that has maybe some

666
00:44:11,391 --> 00:44:14,975
Offensive connotations to it

667
00:44:15,231 --> 00:44:16,511
With Richard which leads

668
00:44:16,767 --> 00:44:18,303
Like Paul being like I didn't

669
00:44:18,815 --> 00:44:19,327
Don't know about this

670
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:23,679
I'm not sure I believe he alright alright buddy

671
00:44:24,191 --> 00:44:30,335
I think that like difference between public and private especially with I get that email being on

672
00:44:30,591 --> 00:44:31,871
On the same day as Alex engaged

673
00:44:32,127 --> 00:44:32,639
Some of this

674
00:44:32,895 --> 00:44:34,687
I think that that is a Grimm

675
00:44:34,943 --> 00:44:35,967
Picture

676
00:44:36,223 --> 00:44:39,039
Yeah it is a peddler of jokes the

677
00:44:39,295 --> 00:44:43,135
You have to have awareness yet in order to find the Crux

678
00:44:43,391 --> 00:44:45,439
Find The Leverage in order to

679
00:44:45,951 --> 00:44:47,487
Elicit the actual joke

680
00:44:47,743 --> 00:44:50,559
Yeah so if you don't have awareness you don't have a joke

681
00:44:50,815 --> 00:44:51,839
If you have a joke

682
00:44:52,351 --> 00:44:52,863
Chances are

683
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:55,935
And that the second thing is that email that you sent

684
00:44:56,191 --> 00:45:00,543
To Berkeley and Anthony gucciardi that was based on a text

685
00:45:00,799 --> 00:45:06,943
Message that he at least some sort of internal conversation about this not being

686
00:45:07,199 --> 00:45:08,479
A good thing to do

687
00:45:08,991 --> 00:45:13,343
So this interview ends deposition ends with

688
00:45:13,855 --> 00:45:19,999
Name something that Alex didn't think was a false flag

689
00:45:20,255 --> 00:45:26,399
Hilo hell yeah he lists off a bunch of things that Alex did

690
00:45:26,655 --> 00:45:31,775
Aurora

691
00:45:32,031 --> 00:45:36,639
I thought he was right

692
00:45:36,895 --> 00:45:38,175
That's all

693
00:45:39,455 --> 00:45:40,735
So you list off of you

694
00:45:40,991 --> 00:45:47,135
Columbine Oklahoma City all these are false Flags what is something that Alex thought was not

695
00:45:47,647 --> 00:45:48,415
Let's find out

696
00:45:48,671 --> 00:45:50,975
Can you give me an example

697
00:45:51,743 --> 00:45:53,791
Open us mass casualty event

698
00:45:54,303 --> 00:45:56,607
Mass shooting bombing or the light

699
00:45:57,375 --> 00:45:58,399
Stat mr. Jones

700
00:45:58,655 --> 00:45:59,423
Didn't say

701
00:46:07,615 --> 00:46:12,223
I would say that the most recent ones post Last Vegas Massacre

702
00:46:12,735 --> 00:46:15,551
Night of the Dayton Ohio shooting

703
00:46:16,063 --> 00:46:20,671
Shooting

704
00:46:21,439 --> 00:46:25,279
I think after the Last Vegas one he was

705
00:46:27,327 --> 00:46:28,095
More

706
00:46:28,351 --> 00:46:30,399
Radisson tacoland false Flags

707
00:46:30,911 --> 00:46:32,191
After I sue the right

708
00:46:33,471 --> 00:46:36,799
I don't know when you sued in

709
00:46:37,055 --> 00:46:43,199
Yeah you do buddy cuz you are quite astutely pointed out both of those

710
00:46:44,223 --> 00:46:46,527
Paul is asking

711
00:46:46,783 --> 00:46:52,927
What did he pick Israel what did happen what isn't just a government Falls like long cause comes up

712
00:46:53,183 --> 00:46:53,951
Two things that Alex

713
00:46:54,207 --> 00:46:55,487
Categorically

714
00:46:55,999 --> 00:47:02,143
Or false flags up by antifa or whatever it is either a

715
00:47:02,399 --> 00:47:07,263
False flag radical Islam or whatever right wasn't that wasn't that it

716
00:47:07,775 --> 00:47:11,615
There two types of terrorists or something

717
00:47:11,871 --> 00:47:14,431
Yeah it's I don't think

718
00:47:15,455 --> 00:47:21,599
I struggle with like how much Paul just doesn't care what Alex does not spare the possibility that he doesn't know what

719
00:47:21,855 --> 00:47:27,999
Alex thinks about Dayton or the El Paso shooting

720
00:47:28,255 --> 00:47:31,071
F****** show there's a very high likely

721
00:47:34,655 --> 00:47:40,799
Yeah I don't know it's tough for me to believe that he doesn't know what Alex's positions on these things are unless there's just

722
00:47:41,567 --> 00:47:43,359
Not caring at all

723
00:47:43,615 --> 00:47:44,895
About just like

724
00:47:45,151 --> 00:47:48,735
Trash in trash out f****** filter it through

725
00:47:48,991 --> 00:47:50,783
Whatever I'll fix the grammar

726
00:47:51,039 --> 00:47:53,343
Yeah I imagine that's the only

727
00:47:53,599 --> 00:47:54,367
The boss to be honest

728
00:47:54,623 --> 00:47:56,927
Yeah I don't know so I don't I don't

729
00:47:57,183 --> 00:47:59,999
I'm interested to see where some of that goes

730
00:48:00,255 --> 00:48:03,839
I see some indications from that deposition that there's some really

731
00:48:04,351 --> 00:48:06,399
What would you call it

732
00:48:06,655 --> 00:48:09,471
Just some good lines of questioning I think there's some

733
00:48:09,983 --> 00:48:10,495
Positive

734
00:48:10,751 --> 00:48:13,823
Indications that they're onto some

735
00:48:15,103 --> 00:48:16,639
Potentially like really

736
00:48:17,151 --> 00:48:20,223
Troubling thing like I said that joke

737
00:48:20,479 --> 00:48:21,503
I would say

738
00:48:22,271 --> 00:48:23,295
Probably most

739
00:48:23,551 --> 00:48:27,391
Not that I know but like that's something that would be easy to

740
00:48:27,647 --> 00:48:31,231
To miss or to discount but the fact that he was like

741
00:48:31,743 --> 00:48:33,535
This is a joke is

742
00:48:33,791 --> 00:48:39,423
This is the Crux point

743
00:48:39,935 --> 00:48:41,471
But I think that you could

744
00:48:41,727 --> 00:48:47,871
If you're Alex you could say like yeah Buckley's a weird dude I didn't either

745
00:48:48,127 --> 00:48:50,943
Whatever I say

746
00:48:51,199 --> 00:48:55,295
You could maybe I'm just inflating the importance of it because it's the only thing I really

747
00:48:56,831 --> 00:48:58,623
And that's why I'm saying

748
00:48:58,879 --> 00:49:00,159
You know like a joke

749
00:49:00,415 --> 00:49:02,975
Especially on the same day as Alex's presentation

750
00:49:03,487 --> 00:49:05,535
That tends to imply

751
00:49:05,791 --> 00:49:07,839
There's a difference between the public and the private

752
00:49:08,095 --> 00:49:09,631
I'm not sure if it proves it

753
00:49:09,887 --> 00:49:12,959
But I do think that it's enough to get put into your mind like

754
00:49:13,727 --> 00:49:14,751
That seems

755
00:49:15,263 --> 00:49:17,823
Seems a response but we'll see

756
00:49:18,335 --> 00:49:19,871
God I want it if I had

757
00:49:20,127 --> 00:49:21,407
This power I would just be

758
00:49:21,663 --> 00:49:23,967
Like if we reach the end of the deposition

759
00:49:24,223 --> 00:49:26,015
As far as the Sandy Hook stuff goes

760
00:49:26,783 --> 00:49:29,855
Now I'm going to lightning round you like climate change real or no

761
00:49:30,111 --> 00:49:30,623
Go

762
00:49:31,135 --> 00:49:37,279
I think that's an abusive being under oath

763
00:49:37,535 --> 00:49:40,095
But my fax on it

764
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:43,167
So move on

765
00:49:43,423 --> 00:49:48,031
To Robert to do let's do it by Robert but

766
00:49:48,287 --> 00:49:49,055
RAB do

767
00:49:49,311 --> 00:49:50,591
Jordan

768
00:49:50,847 --> 00:49:55,199
But I never expected is that robbed is deposition would be the one that I find the most compelling

769
00:49:55,967 --> 00:49:58,783
Both Alex and Paul Joseph Watson said positions

770
00:49:59,039 --> 00:50:00,831
Are interviews between the lawyers

771
00:50:01,087 --> 00:50:04,415
Alex and Paul Joseph Watson as people respectively

772
00:50:05,183 --> 00:50:09,791
They're there to answer questions themselves about their own knowledge and experience

773
00:50:10,303 --> 00:50:16,447
Conversely Rob do is deposed officially as a designated corporate representative for Infowars umbrella cup

774
00:50:16,703 --> 00:50:18,239
Albany Free Speech system

775
00:50:19,263 --> 00:50:21,055
Now that was a bad idea

776
00:50:21,567 --> 00:50:26,943
Rob does not seem to understand what this means

777
00:50:27,199 --> 00:50:33,343
It's clear based on the lawyers questioning that they provided Free Speech systems of the list videos for which they need

778
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:36,927
Provide information about sourcing and how they were produced

779
00:50:37,439 --> 00:50:40,255
Each of these videos which are being said to be defamatory

780
00:50:40,511 --> 00:50:45,119
Contained information that was relevant to the case to you know you want to know where it came from

781
00:50:45,375 --> 00:50:49,215
In order to sort out how these videos were made the lawyers requested Free Speech system

782
00:50:49,471 --> 00:50:51,007
The designated representative to speak

783
00:50:51,263 --> 00:50:52,031
Or the company

784
00:50:52,287 --> 00:50:54,847
But more importantly to prepare

785
00:50:55,103 --> 00:51:01,247
Compile the information they were requested

786
00:51:01,503 --> 00:51:06,367
Ross Muffet robbed robbed

787
00:51:06,623 --> 00:51:07,391
Okay

788
00:51:07,647 --> 00:51:13,791
That's a swing for the fences right there it was robbed his responsibility to speak to the people who produced these videos and

789
00:51:14,047 --> 00:51:17,119
Wrote the article where they got the information from

790
00:51:17,631 --> 00:51:23,775
This is important to sort out because you know if there aren't any sources it could be believable that these

791
00:51:24,031 --> 00:51:25,823
People reading for just making stuff up

792
00:51:26,335 --> 00:51:28,383
Rob do his not prepared at all

793
00:51:28,639 --> 00:51:32,479
His deposition is a profound disrespected this entire process

794
00:51:32,735 --> 00:51:34,271
The reason I think it's interesting

795
00:51:34,527 --> 00:51:37,855
Is it has not read it all like blustery disrespect

796
00:51:38,367 --> 00:51:42,975
This is not Rob dude standing defiant making a mockery of the entire lawsuit

797
00:51:43,231 --> 00:51:49,375
It's a man who seems to really not realize why he's there at the deposition he seems to not know what a.

798
00:51:49,631 --> 00:51:53,215
Corporate representative means he doesn't realize that he's there to speak

799
00:51:53,471 --> 00:51:58,847
Who is the company you can I call you mr. Magoo from the rest of this deposition

800
00:51:59,103 --> 00:52:03,967
His body language and facial responses to questioning read like discomfort in confusion

801
00:52:04,223 --> 00:52:10,367
He's not there to Stonewall on behalf of free speech systems he thought he was there to appear as Rob 2 and I could pass

802
00:52:10,623 --> 00:52:11,647
Where answers like

803
00:52:11,903 --> 00:52:18,047
I don't recall can be used to dodge any question or representative

804
00:52:18,303 --> 00:52:21,119
That question the answer is not acceptable

805
00:52:21,887 --> 00:52:24,191
A company cannot not recall something

806
00:52:24,447 --> 00:52:26,751
It can either know something or it cannot

807
00:52:27,263 --> 00:52:33,407
So in his capacity as a corporate representative Rob do has a responsibility to prepare and know what Free Speech systems

808
00:52:33,663 --> 00:52:34,175
No

809
00:52:34,431 --> 00:52:37,503
Woody's asked what the source for video number one is

810
00:52:38,015 --> 00:52:39,551
You can't not recall

811
00:52:39,807 --> 00:52:44,159
You have to either provide the source or say the company doesn't know what the source was

812
00:52:44,671 --> 00:52:50,047
What he's asked for particular employee worked on Sandy Hook material he can't say I don't recall

813
00:52:50,303 --> 00:52:52,095
You have to say that they did they didn't

814
00:52:52,351 --> 00:52:55,167
Or the Free Speech system doesn't know if they did

815
00:52:55,935 --> 00:53:00,031
Because of his lack of preparation and semen lack of understanding of this role

816
00:53:00,287 --> 00:53:03,615
Rob dudes being forced into a position where he really can't do anything

817
00:53:03,871 --> 00:53:05,919
Other than physically embody the

818
00:53:06,175 --> 00:53:08,479
Competence of Infowars

819
00:53:08,991 --> 00:53:10,527
That might be their only defense

820
00:53:11,039 --> 00:53:12,575
Like hey guys

821
00:53:12,831 --> 00:53:18,975
It's not a good defense a shity run that's what we've got like

822
00:53:19,487 --> 00:53:25,119
You're going to lose that if you just shity and incompetent you're still responsible

823
00:53:25,375 --> 00:53:30,751
This this supports my theory that Alex is just trying to spend all of the money he has

824
00:53:31,263 --> 00:53:36,895
Before the judge Brewster's Million I really think it because Rob do

825
00:53:37,407 --> 00:53:40,479
Azure corporate rapper nobody else

826
00:53:40,991 --> 00:53:47,135
You've been there forever interned he's been there forever he has a you know he hasn't

827
00:53:47,391 --> 00:53:50,719
Has be quote-unquote news director for the the station

828
00:53:50,975 --> 00:53:55,071
Call Cowboys had like executive managerial roles

829
00:53:55,327 --> 00:54:00,447
You've been there as long as just about anybody pulls too smart to do this

830
00:54:00,703 --> 00:54:02,751
Who else would you get like who's still there

831
00:54:03,263 --> 00:54:09,407
Jerome corsi but you have a Magic Carpet representative

832
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:13,503
He's going to get you in more trouble

833
00:54:13,759 --> 00:54:18,879
Yoga Source is free

834
00:54:19,135 --> 00:54:21,951
Rodger going to prison

835
00:54:22,719 --> 00:54:23,487
Who do you have

836
00:54:26,047 --> 00:54:32,191
I don't know also you can't send it in today with her anymore otherwise who

837
00:54:35,519 --> 00:54:40,127
So like I don't think Alex has anybody else other than Rob that you probably Trust

838
00:54:40,383 --> 00:54:43,455
To not like Owen Shroyer

839
00:54:43,711 --> 00:54:47,295
Slayer

840
00:54:49,855 --> 00:54:54,207
Legitimately do think he may not have any other option

841
00:54:54,463 --> 00:54:56,511
No I think you might be David Knight

842
00:54:56,767 --> 00:54:59,583
Maybe I bet

843
00:54:59,839 --> 00:55:01,631
I feel like

844
00:55:01,887 --> 00:55:03,423
I'd love to see that position with him

845
00:55:03,935 --> 00:55:10,079
Did he didn't get the post I hope you did not not into using the release that then we got it

846
00:55:10,335 --> 00:55:14,175
It's very very very funny even the lawyers for that we're like

847
00:55:14,687 --> 00:55:17,759
God he's too boring he's just too boring to depose

848
00:55:18,015 --> 00:55:22,111
Shell on his information sit there listening

849
00:55:22,367 --> 00:55:24,671
A 2-hour nap be helpful

850
00:55:25,951 --> 00:55:32,095
Look it wasn't a surprise what topics were going to be discussed in Rob's deposition or what capacity Rob was a

851
00:55:32,351 --> 00:55:34,911
Hearing it and yet this is how he shows up

852
00:55:35,167 --> 00:55:38,239
It's disrespectful but it's not Macho disrespect

853
00:55:38,495 --> 00:55:41,055
It's disrespect born out of a person not being equipped

854
00:55:41,311 --> 00:55:44,383
To have the conversation that they were legally required to have

855
00:55:44,639 --> 00:55:47,711
Yeah I find robbed this deposition

856
00:55:47,967 --> 00:55:51,295
Far more fascinating than Alex and Paul Joseph Watson because of that dynamic

857
00:55:52,063 --> 00:55:54,111
It feels like he might as well as like

858
00:55:54,879 --> 00:56:00,255
Sent Brendan dassey in there anybody

859
00:56:00,767 --> 00:56:02,303
I don't know send

860
00:56:03,071 --> 00:56:04,607
The tank

861
00:56:05,631 --> 00:56:11,007
The other reason I find excuse me could you please establish your ownership

862
00:56:11,263 --> 00:56:17,407
Answer your opinion of some people that I'm owned by some things I do

863
00:56:17,663 --> 00:56:23,807
Yeah the other reason that I find Rob's interview and deposition more interesting is because

864
00:56:24,319 --> 00:56:29,951
In addition to being there in a formal capacity as a representative of free speech system

865
00:56:30,719 --> 00:56:32,767
This is supposed to be about the sorcerer

866
00:56:33,279 --> 00:56:37,119
This is supposed to be about where did you get this information from

867
00:56:37,375 --> 00:56:39,423
And that's always something that I would love

868
00:56:39,679 --> 00:56:45,823
For these people to be forced answer is always going to be either made it up or

869
00:56:46,335 --> 00:56:49,919
Weird right-wing websites Larry.

870
00:56:50,175 --> 00:56:51,711
Some completely

871
00:56:52,223 --> 00:56:58,367
Uncredible person like a pet sitter Wolfgang halbig absolutely it's always going to be

872
00:56:58,623 --> 00:57:02,207
Exactly what you know it is but they pretend it's not

873
00:57:02,463 --> 00:57:06,047
Always going to be some flimsy b*******

874
00:57:06,559 --> 00:57:07,839
Disrupt you give

875
00:57:08,095 --> 00:57:08,607
Any source

876
00:57:09,375 --> 00:57:11,935
Okay alright the situations where

877
00:57:12,191 --> 00:57:18,335
Like you know how whenever I talk about like when Alex sits down he's like I'm going to prove Chemtrails yay

878
00:57:18,591 --> 00:57:24,735
Excited cuz then I'm like okay you will actually give me things to go and find right always get pumped

879
00:57:24,991 --> 00:57:28,575
About that is anyway I always get really excited when

880
00:57:28,831 --> 00:57:30,623
There is the prospect of

881
00:57:31,135 --> 00:57:31,647
They're going to

882
00:57:32,159 --> 00:57:32,927
Have to answer that

883
00:57:33,439 --> 00:57:34,719
Yeah it's because

884
00:57:35,231 --> 00:57:37,791
By all accounts this should be there big day

885
00:57:38,047 --> 00:57:38,559
Yeah

886
00:57:38,815 --> 00:57:44,959
They are the truth-tellers Eyeworld they're the ones who were right about everything in the globalist media can't stay

887
00:57:45,215 --> 00:57:51,359
And it for sure setting where Rob do is tasked with laying out

888
00:57:51,615 --> 00:57:53,919
The sources that they have for this

889
00:57:54,175 --> 00:57:56,735
Course for the hit that the coverage that they had

890
00:57:57,247 --> 00:58:03,391
And it's just such a dud they also have tons of exonerating I don't know if you do that they've got them

891
00:58:03,903 --> 00:58:07,487
Any other things Rob is like not going to

892
00:58:07,743 --> 00:58:09,791
Give you any of the sources

893
00:58:10,303 --> 00:58:16,191
You should pretend that their privileged sources or something like that. We we refused to give up our sources

894
00:58:16,703 --> 00:58:22,591
And there's none of them to have some sort of trintellix

895
00:58:22,847 --> 00:58:24,127
There is none of that

896
00:58:24,383 --> 00:58:26,687
Posturing and bravado.

897
00:58:27,199 --> 00:58:29,759
So anyway here restart Rob's deposition

898
00:58:30,271 --> 00:58:34,367
And he says something that is ultimately the least true thing possible

899
00:58:34,879 --> 00:58:35,647
Which of the

900
00:58:35,903 --> 00:58:36,415
The Four Tops

901
00:58:36,671 --> 00:58:37,183
It's listed

902
00:58:37,439 --> 00:58:38,207
The bottom page one

903
00:58:38,463 --> 00:58:38,975
Top of page

904
00:58:42,047 --> 00:58:42,815
A cheetah

905
00:58:45,119 --> 00:58:46,143
Sourcing and research

906
00:58:46,399 --> 00:58:47,167
Forward the video to

907
00:58:47,423 --> 00:58:47,935
Scruggs

908
00:58:49,215 --> 00:58:49,727
Tissue

909
00:58:52,031 --> 00:58:53,311
Internal editorial discussion

910
00:58:53,567 --> 00:58:54,335
Kindergarten

911
00:58:55,103 --> 00:58:55,871
Coverage

912
00:58:56,127 --> 00:58:56,639
Sandy Hook

913
00:58:58,175 --> 00:58:58,687
He is not

914
00:59:03,295 --> 00:59:09,439
So a lot of this interview deposition is hit the lawyer ass

915
00:59:09,695 --> 00:59:15,071
Asking about various people in whether or not they still work at Infowars because Rob has this sort of

916
00:59:15,583 --> 00:59:19,679
I guess maybe it is a thing where if they don't still work there he would

917
00:59:19,935 --> 00:59:26,079
Be able to really ask them what they did or corporate representative

918
00:59:26,335 --> 00:59:30,687
Potato press on people who don't work there anymore Jackson doesn't work there anymore

919
00:59:30,943 --> 00:59:33,247
So there's no line of questioning about them

920
00:59:33,503 --> 00:59:36,575
Why people like Darren mcbreen or Daria

921
00:59:37,087 --> 00:59:37,855
Do they ask

922
00:59:38,111 --> 00:59:43,231
Did they have anything to do

923
00:59:44,255 --> 00:59:46,559
I don't recall and then they have to remind him

924
00:59:46,815 --> 00:59:52,959
Does Free Speech systems no play like I don't know

925
00:59:54,751 --> 00:59:57,311
Constant over and over and over again

926
00:59:57,567 --> 00:59:58,847
Someone is brought up

927
01:00:01,663 --> 01:00:06,527
I don't know why I'm here guys so a lot of these clips are just titled Rob is not prepared

928
01:00:08,319 --> 01:00:13,183
So I don't know how to set this up but Rob is not

929
01:00:13,439 --> 01:00:13,951
Cher

930
01:00:15,999 --> 01:00:16,767
Deposition testimony

931
01:00:17,535 --> 01:00:18,815
Regarding sourcing and research

932
01:00:19,583 --> 01:00:20,351
Videos described

933
01:00:24,959 --> 01:00:25,471
Not much

934
01:00:29,567 --> 01:00:30,591
What

935
01:00:31,871 --> 01:00:32,639
Wicked indeed

936
01:00:35,711 --> 01:00:36,479
This document

937
01:00:40,319 --> 01:00:40,831
Germs

938
01:00:43,391 --> 01:00:44,159
Yikes

939
01:00:44,415 --> 01:00:50,559
That document that he's referring to is the list of videos that are supposed to be discussed so that's the only thing

940
01:00:52,095 --> 01:00:56,447
Let me let me throw this out there for all right now

941
01:00:57,983 --> 01:00:59,775
When you say a woman is beautiful

942
01:01:02,847 --> 01:01:06,687
When you say I'm prepared to speak about A and B

943
01:01:07,455 --> 01:01:10,527
Didn't you say that you're not essentially

944
01:01:11,039 --> 01:01:17,183
Benetton objective fact that you are not prepared

945
01:01:19,743 --> 01:01:25,887
So they have to keep reminding him that he's there is a corporate representative

946
01:01:26,143 --> 01:01:26,911
For that as well

947
01:01:27,679 --> 01:01:28,191
Did you ask him if

948
01:01:28,447 --> 01:01:28,959
He's done research

949
01:01:34,079 --> 01:01:34,847
So you don't know whether

950
01:01:44,831 --> 01:01:46,111
I can't remember any videos

951
01:01:47,647 --> 01:01:48,159
That was

952
01:01:49,695 --> 01:01:50,207
Because I'm not asking

953
01:01:54,047 --> 01:01:54,559
Terriers

954
01:01:55,071 --> 01:01:55,839
To discuss topic

955
01:01:56,351 --> 01:01:57,119
As it applies

956
01:01:58,911 --> 01:01:59,679
Sort my question

957
01:02:00,447 --> 01:02:01,215
Are you prepared

958
01:02:01,471 --> 01:02:01,983
Discuss

959
01:02:02,239 --> 01:02:02,751
The research

960
01:02:03,519 --> 01:02:04,543
The dermacrine was involved

961
01:02:04,799 --> 01:02:05,311
What's regarding Sandy

962
01:02:12,479 --> 01:02:13,503
That happens

963
01:02:18,111 --> 01:02:24,255
So in this next clip they try and explain to Rob like what he is therefore and then they teach him

964
01:02:24,511 --> 01:02:25,791
Alphabet like what's going on

965
01:02:26,047 --> 01:02:28,607
Doesn't seem to really grasp

966
01:02:28,863 --> 01:02:32,191
I think he does eventually but it takes a while

967
01:02:34,239 --> 01:02:34,751
This priest

968
01:02:38,079 --> 01:02:38,591
Paralysis.

969
01:03:01,119 --> 01:03:03,167
The answer is no

970
01:03:04,447 --> 01:03:04,959
I didn't ask what

971
01:03:06,495 --> 01:03:07,007
Weather

972
01:03:14,431 --> 01:03:14,943
Videos

973
01:03:30,815 --> 01:03:32,607
You understand that when you were tab

974
01:03:33,375 --> 01:03:34,143
Representative

975
01:03:34,399 --> 01:03:35,679
Topic that you had a duty

976
01:03:36,191 --> 01:03:37,727
Prepare yourself to discuss that topic

977
01:03:40,031 --> 01:03:40,543
Nobody

978
01:03:42,591 --> 01:03:43,103
Right now

979
01:03:43,615 --> 01:03:44,639
You are under the impression that you

980
01:03:46,687 --> 01:03:47,199
Testify

981
01:03:47,455 --> 01:03:48,223
As to what you

982
01:03:48,479 --> 01:03:48,991
You know Percy

983
01:04:02,047 --> 01:04:02,559
What did you say

984
01:04:11,775 --> 01:04:14,079
Interview right then like

985
01:04:14,335 --> 01:04:20,479
You can get the sense that like we're here to have a conversation about this forcing stuff you have not prepared in any way

986
01:04:20,735 --> 01:04:22,015
You don't understand your role

987
01:04:22,271 --> 01:04:24,063
Is a corporate representative

988
01:04:24,319 --> 01:04:26,623
Why are we proceeded why I would just be like

989
01:04:26,879 --> 01:04:33,023
Get out of here and then we will reschedule this instead they keep going

990
01:04:33,279 --> 01:04:36,863
To embarrass him but it's

991
01:04:37,119 --> 01:04:38,143
I think that

992
01:04:38,399 --> 01:04:41,727
Like they keep trying to dig okay is there something

993
01:04:42,751 --> 01:04:44,799
You do note sourcing of

994
01:04:45,055 --> 01:04:51,199
Trinkets yet information and so they talk about us

995
01:04:51,455 --> 01:04:55,295
Report at the front of the class the teachers like did you do the book report here like

996
01:04:56,063 --> 01:04:58,367
No and they're like okay then sit down

997
01:04:58,623 --> 01:04:59,135
That's it

998
01:04:59,391 --> 01:05:00,415
You should probably

999
01:05:00,671 --> 01:05:01,439
But instead

1000
01:05:01,951 --> 01:05:07,583
You know we just trying Soldier I'll just try and find something that you do know the source of that we can work with

1001
01:05:08,095 --> 01:05:08,607
Are you

1002
01:05:08,863 --> 01:05:10,911
Believe sitting here right now that you're

1003
01:05:11,679 --> 01:05:13,471
Care to discuss the store scene

1004
01:05:13,983 --> 01:05:14,495
Research that

1005
01:05:15,007 --> 01:05:15,519
2y peep

1006
01:05:17,567 --> 01:05:18,335
Yes I do

1007
01:05:18,591 --> 01:05:19,103
Adam DeVine

1008
01:05:20,639 --> 01:05:21,151
What's the source

1009
01:05:23,199 --> 01:05:25,247
I don't know this person

1010
01:05:25,759 --> 01:05:27,039
That's not a good answer

1011
01:05:27,551 --> 01:05:31,903
You say that you're prepared to talk about the sourcing of the video that you edited

1012
01:05:32,415 --> 01:05:38,559
And it's probably some random person yeah probably is a problem

1013
01:05:38,815 --> 01:05:41,631
Another problem so that's not good

1014
01:05:43,679 --> 01:05:44,703
This is where we getting

1015
01:05:44,959 --> 01:05:45,471
Trouble with

1016
01:05:46,495 --> 01:05:50,335
The law and people who feel like stuff they want to be true is

1017
01:05:51,871 --> 01:05:52,383
Yield

1018
01:05:53,919 --> 01:05:56,479
Real so prepared for this alright ask me a question

1019
01:05:56,991 --> 01:05:58,271
What's an opinion

1020
01:05:58,527 --> 01:06:02,367
I have no f****** clue I am so prepared for this next question

1021
01:06:02,623 --> 01:06:03,135
What's a fact

1022
01:06:03,391 --> 01:06:07,743
I have no clue that's question so prepare

1023
01:06:08,255 --> 01:06:13,887
What's up big piece of information in the summer and a person probably brought up

1024
01:06:14,143 --> 01:06:18,751
Leads to talking about the Anderson Cooper nose disappearing ship

1025
01:06:19,007 --> 01:06:21,055
Green screen breaks believe

1026
01:06:21,567 --> 01:06:26,943
And the lawyer gets a little bit sappy you about the ideas that

1027
01:06:27,455 --> 01:06:33,599
The FBI as forensic experts that have testified that this is not a green screen

1028
01:06:33,855 --> 01:06:36,671
Write this is a compression error in the video that is happening

1029
01:06:37,183 --> 01:06:39,743
Hey Rob you doesn't trust that and

1030
01:06:39,999 --> 01:06:46,143
I think that you could understand a person getting a little bit frustrated at that you'll believe random people you don't believe me

1031
01:06:46,399 --> 01:06:46,911
FBI

1032
01:06:47,423 --> 01:06:48,447
He gets a little Agro

1033
01:06:48,959 --> 01:06:49,983
Mistake or not mistake

1034
01:06:51,263 --> 01:06:53,823
Anderson Cooper was buying Toulouse wasn't in front of a blue screen

1035
01:06:59,455 --> 01:07:04,831
The only reason I would say it's not a hundred percent into somebody asked him if he was there and he denied being at the

1036
01:07:07,647 --> 01:07:08,671
Videos

1037
01:07:09,439 --> 01:07:10,975
Video of a guy asking him

1038
01:07:11,231 --> 01:07:14,047
During a taping of a show and said hey were you at the

1039
01:07:14,559 --> 01:07:15,839
If you don't know I wasn't

1040
01:07:16,351 --> 01:07:17,119
Right he wasn't

1041
01:07:17,375 --> 01:07:18,399
A tan inside the

1042
01:07:22,495 --> 01:07:23,775
You understand that

1043
01:07:24,799 --> 01:07:25,311
You

1044
01:07:25,567 --> 01:07:28,383
Corporate representative for free speech systems another lawsuit

1045
01:07:29,151 --> 01:07:30,943
In Texas correct

1046
01:07:32,223 --> 01:07:34,015
Tremont you understand that

1047
01:07:34,271 --> 01:07:34,783
Expert

1048
01:07:35,295 --> 01:07:37,343
Who has Decades of service in the FBI

1049
01:07:37,599 --> 01:07:38,367
Video forensics

1050
01:07:38,879 --> 01:07:39,391
Determined

1051
01:07:39,647 --> 01:07:40,159
But that was not a boy

1052
01:07:44,511 --> 01:07:45,535
I've heard people say stuff

1053
01:07:46,047 --> 01:07:48,863
You know the FBI also said they

1054
01:07:49,119 --> 01:07:52,447
Photos of two guys who supposedly bombed the Boston

1055
01:07:52,959 --> 01:07:55,007
Marathon

1056
01:07:56,287 --> 01:07:57,311
So the FBI weisel

1057
01:07:57,567 --> 01:07:58,847
So you don't trust the FBI

1058
01:08:01,151 --> 01:08:02,687
I don't really trust much

1059
01:08:04,223 --> 01:08:04,735
Okay

1060
01:08:05,759 --> 01:08:08,319
Do you trust Anonymous sources on 4chan

1061
01:08:09,343 --> 01:08:10,623
I don't know if I've ever used

1062
01:08:11,647 --> 01:08:13,951
Do you know that's where the picture of Marcel Fontaine was

1063
01:08:14,719 --> 01:08:15,231
What's

1064
01:08:15,487 --> 01:08:15,999
Found

1065
01:08:16,255 --> 01:08:17,023
Didn't use

1066
01:08:18,815 --> 01:08:19,327
Are you

1067
01:08:21,375 --> 01:08:23,423
You don't understand you don't know who Marcel fontanez

1068
01:08:25,983 --> 01:08:29,823
Is the Easter poor individual that lives in Massachusetts that Infowars

1069
01:08:30,591 --> 01:08:35,455
Randomly put up his picture saying he wasn't he was responsible for the Florida Parkland mass shooting

1070
01:08:35,711 --> 01:08:37,247
Interpretation

1071
01:08:39,039 --> 01:08:44,927
Why didn't put that up but it what from my understanding I'm not asking you whether you put it up I'm asking

1072
01:08:45,183 --> 01:08:47,743
Free Speech systems is okay trusting an anonymous source

1073
01:08:47,999 --> 01:08:49,279
Completely

1074
01:08:49,535 --> 01:08:50,303
Unverifiable

1075
01:08:51,071 --> 01:08:53,375
Using that information but not trusting the f

1076
01:08:53,631 --> 01:08:54,143
Fiat

1077
01:08:55,167 --> 01:08:56,703
Is that what you're telling testifying to

1078
01:09:07,199 --> 01:09:11,039
I still don't understand the core concept of a corporate representative

1079
01:09:16,415 --> 01:09:16,927
It's been

1080
01:09:21,791 --> 01:09:23,327
To cover up cover their own

1081
01:09:26,911 --> 01:09:27,679
You tell your uncle that

1082
01:09:29,471 --> 01:09:35,615
It's already established that the reviews on colizzi former FBI

1083
01:09:35,871 --> 01:09:36,383
What's the worst

1084
01:09:36,639 --> 01:09:39,455
To cast aspersions about Sandy Hook

1085
01:09:39,967 --> 01:09:42,527
That long cuz they're I think is really like

1086
01:09:42,783 --> 01:09:44,063
Indicative

1087
01:09:44,575 --> 01:09:49,183
When I said that it's not a brazo like nacho kind of

1088
01:09:49,439 --> 01:09:51,999
Disrespect there is a look on his face look like

1089
01:09:52,255 --> 01:09:56,095
Like I know you're joking like s*** what do I say but there is a feeling of like

1090
01:09:56,863 --> 01:09:57,375
What

1091
01:09:57,887 --> 01:10:04,031
Why do know that does makes total sense why would we trust not me personally

1092
01:10:04,287 --> 01:10:08,895
I'm here for the company that deed use anonymous attacks report

1093
01:10:09,151 --> 01:10:09,919
And yet I am

1094
01:10:10,175 --> 01:10:12,735
Saying the FBI's experts are full of s***

1095
01:10:12,991 --> 01:10:16,831
That is a tough line to walk in the same way that Paul is trapped with

1096
01:10:17,087 --> 01:10:20,671
Hey why are these people insane Alex is totally fine

1097
01:10:20,927 --> 01:10:23,743
It is like yeah you know what I really

1098
01:10:23,999 --> 01:10:25,535
Don't have a good answer for this

1099
01:10:27,071 --> 01:10:28,351
He said he talked to his at

1100
01:10:29,375 --> 01:10:33,215
So his attorney must not know that he was the corporate representative right

1101
01:10:33,727 --> 01:10:38,847
Otherwise the attorney cuz it seems like the only advice that his attorney could have possibly given him is

1102
01:10:39,103 --> 01:10:41,407
Say you don't know over and over

1103
01:10:41,663 --> 01:10:42,175
Dobrik

1104
01:10:42,431 --> 01:10:48,575
Vitiv like been the thing where you talk to Barnes Barnes & Noble longer their lawyer and he was not doing

1105
01:10:48,831 --> 01:10:50,623
A good job baby like

1106
01:10:50,879 --> 01:10:53,695
Tell him that the FBI's a bunch of liars

1107
01:10:53,951 --> 01:10:57,023
I'll probably more billable hours

1108
01:10:57,279 --> 01:10:59,583
I don't know what yeah I have no idea

1109
01:10:59,839 --> 01:11:05,983
It does seem like they've had a change in lawyer possibly there's a mystery

1110
01:11:06,239 --> 01:11:07,263
Caitian possibly

1111
01:11:07,519 --> 01:11:10,847
Nobody didn't get the right info where it's supposed to be

1112
01:11:11,103 --> 01:11:13,663
But yeah it seems absurd to me that no one was like

1113
01:11:13,919 --> 01:11:15,455
When I when you appear right

1114
01:11:15,711 --> 01:11:21,855
Mnl48 you could have been talking to his lawyer and the lawyer like you know your appearing as a corporate beside you bet I do

1115
01:11:23,647 --> 01:11:29,279
Or we pay the lawyer assumes he knows what that entails and he doesn't it

1116
01:11:29,535 --> 01:11:30,303
If possible

1117
01:11:32,095 --> 01:11:38,239
Rob do you think you're prepared for this be back okay then you get on in there buddy

1118
01:11:39,519 --> 01:11:42,591
So Rob claims that respectful

1119
01:11:42,847 --> 01:11:44,895
The victims and family members

1120
01:11:45,151 --> 01:11:50,271
So he was unprepared for this this is one of these like you know

1121
01:11:50,783 --> 01:11:56,159
Just a slow motion volleyball hit that Rob is doing

1122
01:11:56,415 --> 01:12:02,559
It just like immediately cuts to normal speed and someone on the other side spices in there for me

1123
01:12:02,815 --> 01:12:04,863
And I believe kids are trying to kill in the beginning

1124
01:12:06,399 --> 01:12:08,447
And if you look at our articles

1125
01:12:11,775 --> 01:12:14,591
We always talk about the victims we were never

1126
01:12:15,103 --> 01:12:16,895
Disparaging towards the parents

1127
01:12:18,687 --> 01:12:22,015
Video of mr. Jones mocking Robert Parker

1128
01:12:22,271 --> 01:12:23,295
Bothered by mocking it

1129
01:12:23,551 --> 01:12:25,087
Crying is grieving father truly

1130
01:12:26,111 --> 01:12:28,159
Robbie Parker's father I don't know if ever seen the video

1131
01:12:29,951 --> 01:12:30,463
Caesar

1132
01:12:30,719 --> 01:12:33,023
You seen the video of mr. Jones mocking Robin Park

1133
01:12:33,791 --> 01:12:35,327
About crying over his dead son

1134
01:12:35,583 --> 01:12:36,095
Right

1135
01:12:40,447 --> 01:12:41,471
Video

1136
01:12:41,727 --> 01:12:43,007
Your corporate representative

1137
01:12:43,519 --> 01:12:46,591
So you're not prepared to talk about that video that's listed in Plano

1138
01:12:46,847 --> 01:12:47,359
Petition that

1139
01:12:47,615 --> 01:12:48,639
But you have duty

1140
01:12:48,895 --> 01:12:49,407
Need to prepare for

1141
01:12:50,175 --> 01:12:52,479
Video

1142
01:12:52,735 --> 01:12:54,271
Robbie Parker crying over son

1143
01:12:54,527 --> 01:12:56,319
Ono of mr. Jones mocking

1144
01:12:56,575 --> 01:12:57,087
Robbie Parker

1145
01:12:57,599 --> 01:12:58,111
Crying over

1146
01:13:01,183 --> 01:13:03,743
I wouldn't be either omad

1147
01:13:04,255 --> 01:13:10,399
That stuff back when you're trying to present like we were always very respectful what about this time Alex is mocking

1148
01:13:10,655 --> 01:13:12,191
Who's on first

1149
01:13:13,215 --> 01:13:14,751
Illegal

1150
01:13:16,287 --> 01:13:16,799
Do this

1151
01:13:19,359 --> 01:13:21,919
I don't know the law well.

1152
01:13:22,431 --> 01:13:26,015
A lawyer supposed to like his contempt

1153
01:13:26,527 --> 01:13:32,671
Contemptible legal definition but I find this to be

1154
01:13:32,927 --> 01:13:39,071
Describe it is a rank disrespect not

1155
01:13:39,327 --> 01:13:43,935
Middle finger but we just like I don't even care enough to do what I have to do

1156
01:13:44,191 --> 01:13:44,959
Locked up

1157
01:13:45,471 --> 01:13:46,239
So

1158
01:13:46,495 --> 01:13:49,823
What are the other big things that Infowars did

1159
01:13:50,079 --> 01:13:53,663
In their Sandy Hook coverage that is particularly disrespectful

1160
01:13:54,175 --> 01:13:55,199
Is that they

1161
01:13:55,455 --> 01:13:56,735
Put on screen

1162
01:13:56,991 --> 01:14:01,855
And posted the address that Lenny Posner used to pick up his mail

1163
01:14:02,111 --> 01:14:04,927
Yeah the PO box that he was using that was

1164
01:14:05,183 --> 01:14:11,071
I believe the address of the honor Network which was the foundation that he put

1165
01:14:11,327 --> 01:14:11,839
Together

1166
01:14:12,095 --> 01:14:12,863
To try

1167
01:14:13,119 --> 01:14:19,263
To get like pictures of the children eloquent conspiracy theorists would use their pictures

1168
01:14:20,287 --> 01:14:25,663
Videos dmca structures

1169
01:14:25,919 --> 01:14:26,943
Heroic

1170
01:14:27,199 --> 01:14:28,479
So Alex

1171
01:14:28,735 --> 01:14:31,807
Was pissed off about this because some videos of

1172
01:14:32,319 --> 01:14:37,951
Fringe weirdos that he Associates with we're being taken down at the attack on Free Speech

1173
01:14:38,463 --> 01:14:38,975
So

1174
01:14:39,231 --> 01:14:45,375
They got into the honor Network and posted Lenny posner's PO Box address

1175
01:14:45,631 --> 01:14:47,935
Right on

1176
01:14:48,191 --> 01:14:48,703
Which

1177
01:14:48,959 --> 01:14:51,775
Some people could say is

1178
01:14:52,031 --> 01:14:52,799
Robert

1179
01:14:53,567 --> 01:14:56,639
Probably not a safe thing to do

1180
01:14:57,919 --> 01:15:01,503
So they discussed that a little bit and Rob

1181
01:15:01,759 --> 01:15:03,295
Makes pretty

1182
01:15:03,807 --> 01:15:05,087
F*****-up claim

1183
01:15:05,599 --> 01:15:06,111
The videos.

1184
01:15:07,647 --> 01:15:08,415
Had taken down

1185
01:15:08,671 --> 01:15:09,439
Are those true

1186
01:15:10,719 --> 01:15:11,231
Sitting here

1187
01:15:19,423 --> 01:15:20,959
Might have to see the video

1188
01:15:21,983 --> 01:15:22,495
Uno

1189
01:15:24,799 --> 01:15:25,823
Sitting here today weather

1190
01:15:26,591 --> 01:15:29,151
Buddy I think a lot of it he pulled down just cuz

1191
01:15:29,407 --> 01:15:30,943
They were given carte blanche

1192
01:15:31,967 --> 01:15:34,271
And you're just making that up you have no evidence

1193
01:15:38,879 --> 01:15:39,647
I have no idea

1194
01:15:40,671 --> 01:15:43,487
And I just want to make sure again we're sitting here as you make up information

1195
01:15:44,767 --> 01:15:45,535
Makeup information

1196
01:15:47,583 --> 01:15:48,607
Okay

1197
01:15:48,863 --> 01:15:53,215
Okay it sucks to be in that situation where you are just making stuff up and

1198
01:15:53,471 --> 01:15:55,519
Just to be clear you're making that up

1199
01:15:56,287 --> 01:15:57,823
I mean

1200
01:15:58,591 --> 01:16:01,407
I don't have evidence to answer like

1201
01:16:01,663 --> 01:16:02,175
Yeah

1202
01:16:02,431 --> 01:16:02,943
Yeah

1203
01:16:03,199 --> 01:16:09,343
Yeah it's very childish it and I think that's what happens when people do stuff like info

1204
01:16:09,599 --> 01:16:13,439
Ford Hazard cornered like you can't really have any other

1205
01:16:13,951 --> 01:16:18,559
A response then like sort of indignant disappointment

1206
01:16:20,351 --> 01:16:21,119
It's that it's

1207
01:16:21,375 --> 01:16:27,263
It's sad now it's it's still wall like it what are you okay you Corner him and he just says fine

1208
01:16:27,775 --> 01:16:29,311
You think I make stuff up all this

1209
01:16:29,823 --> 01:16:34,175
I'm never going to actually believe that you're never going to be satisfied no

1210
01:16:34,431 --> 01:16:39,551
And that that's what I was getting out of the beginning of what why this is a more compelling

1211
01:16:39,807 --> 01:16:41,599
Deposition is because

1212
01:16:41,855 --> 01:16:45,183
Presumably this would be where Infowars it supposed to shine

1213
01:16:45,439 --> 01:16:47,487
Yeah if they were what they pretend to be

1214
01:16:47,999 --> 01:16:48,767
The sourcing

1215
01:16:49,023 --> 01:16:55,167
Deposition would be long

1216
01:16:55,423 --> 01:17:01,567
On every on the record everything

1217
01:17:01,823 --> 01:17:06,431
Yeah Lynn Posner was just launched to take everything down and

1218
01:17:06,687 --> 01:17:07,455
Like what

1219
01:17:10,527 --> 01:17:12,575
I mean I feel like it

1220
01:17:13,855 --> 01:17:14,367
So

1221
01:17:14,623 --> 01:17:20,767
Rob it is also unprepared because he doesn't have access to all the videos

1222
01:17:21,791 --> 01:17:24,607
To go over right

1223
01:17:24,863 --> 01:17:25,631
Just this one more time

1224
01:17:26,143 --> 01:17:26,655
You are the

1225
01:17:26,911 --> 01:17:31,007
Corporate representative

1226
01:17:31,263 --> 01:17:33,567
YouTube took down their YouTube channel

1227
01:17:33,823 --> 01:17:38,431
So all those videos are gone right

1228
01:17:40,735 --> 01:17:44,319
I don't know. Dog internet 8 homework

1229
01:17:44,575 --> 01:17:50,719
Rob claims that one of the videos that you supposed to prepare all the sourcing for inside like

1230
01:17:50,975 --> 01:17:52,767
Can't find it

1231
01:17:53,023 --> 01:17:54,559
And then his lawyer

1232
01:17:54,815 --> 01:17:57,887
My God he is just not putting up with Rob spoken

1233
01:17:58,399 --> 01:17:59,423
You don't have

1234
01:18:00,703 --> 01:18:01,727
By you you mean

1235
01:18:04,543 --> 01:18:06,591
I didn't have it in any of the searches

1236
01:18:07,103 --> 01:18:08,639
Okay where'd you search

1237
01:18:12,223 --> 01:18:15,295
I've seen some of these actually one on the internet see if people and reposted them

1238
01:18:15,551 --> 01:18:16,831
I didn't find anything

1239
01:18:17,343 --> 01:18:18,623
Refined

1240
01:18:18,879 --> 01:18:19,391
Stop it

1241
01:18:21,183 --> 01:18:22,463
People repostar stuff

1242
01:18:28,095 --> 01:18:29,119
How long did you spend

1243
01:18:30,143 --> 01:18:30,911
Sources

1244
01:18:31,167 --> 01:18:31,935
Video

1245
01:18:33,983 --> 01:18:37,055
For Sandy Hook false narratives versus the reality

1246
01:18:38,079 --> 01:18:39,871
Electrical video Maybe

1247
01:18:43,199 --> 01:18:43,967
15 minutes

1248
01:18:44,479 --> 01:18:46,527
Are you aware that in this

1249
01:18:59,327 --> 01:19:00,863
The problem is

1250
01:19:01,119 --> 01:19:02,399
I think I discuss this in the lab

1251
01:19:02,655 --> 01:19:03,167
Deposition

1252
01:19:04,191 --> 01:19:09,055
We don't have videos that's the titles that you're using or you're referring to YouTube titles

1253
01:19:09,823 --> 01:19:11,615
Those aren't always

1254
01:19:12,127 --> 01:19:13,663
What's a video file as name

1255
01:19:13,919 --> 01:19:14,431
When he gets up

1256
01:19:15,199 --> 01:19:15,711
Urdu

1257
01:19:15,967 --> 01:19:16,991
You gave me this video

1258
01:19:17,247 --> 01:19:20,575
Free Speech systems produced this to me not you too

1259
01:19:22,623 --> 01:19:23,135
Understand

1260
01:19:23,647 --> 01:19:24,159
So

1261
01:19:25,439 --> 01:19:26,719
You have it in your possession

1262
01:19:27,999 --> 01:19:28,511
Correct

1263
01:19:32,095 --> 01:19:32,607
What is possession

1264
01:19:35,679 --> 01:19:36,191
I don't know if I

1265
01:19:36,959 --> 01:19:39,007
How on Earth could Free Speech systems

1266
01:19:39,263 --> 01:19:41,567
Reduce a video to me and it not be in your possession

1267
01:19:43,103 --> 01:19:44,639
You had it in you spoliated it

1268
01:19:44,895 --> 01:19:46,175
Which is the destruction of evidence

1269
01:19:46,431 --> 01:19:47,455
Or two

1270
01:19:47,711 --> 01:19:50,271
You never had it yet somehow magically produced it

1271
01:19:51,551 --> 01:19:52,319
Which one of those is

1272
01:19:52,575 --> 01:19:53,343
It's probably more Act

1273
01:19:53,599 --> 01:19:54,367
Or 3

1274
01:19:54,623 --> 01:19:55,903
You're just not prepared

1275
01:19:56,415 --> 01:19:56,927
Discuss

1276
01:19:57,439 --> 01:19:58,463
Discuss

1277
01:19:59,743 --> 01:20:05,887
Those three I think that's probably

1278
01:20:06,143 --> 01:20:12,287
Video you gave it to me excuse me sir I would like to amend that back to Magic

1279
01:20:12,543 --> 01:20:14,592
Asthmatic admissible in the court of law

1280
01:20:14,848 --> 01:20:18,688
I mean that is so disrespectful that is that is just like

1281
01:20:19,200 --> 01:20:20,480
Manifestly

1282
01:20:20,736 --> 01:20:21,504
I don't care

1283
01:20:21,760 --> 01:20:27,392
Yeah I was told I was supposed to do all this stuff I'm not taking this seriously at all absolutely

1284
01:20:28,928 --> 01:20:32,256
Horrifying maybe not the right word but it's it's

1285
01:20:32,768 --> 01:20:33,280
It really is

1286
01:20:33,536 --> 01:20:39,424
Is this is the first time I've been surprised in 2019 right now though

1287
01:20:39,680 --> 01:20:41,728
So the subject

1288
01:20:42,240 --> 01:20:48,384
And every know the Kraken right is released from time-to-time sure and one of the things I find

1289
01:20:48,640 --> 01:20:51,968
Particularly interesting about their angle on but button is

1290
01:20:52,224 --> 01:20:54,016
There's a unified front

1291
01:20:54,272 --> 01:21:00,416
Pushing the idea that damn Dandy went around it was yelling at people at Sandy Hook

1292
01:21:00,672 --> 01:21:03,232
Galaxy like I don't want anything to do with you

1293
01:21:03,744 --> 01:21:09,888
You're fired get out of here in the first place microphone screen that says Infowars

1294
01:21:10,144 --> 01:21:16,288
Cut it out how do we how do we do

1295
01:21:16,544 --> 01:21:17,568
Chain that illusion

1296
01:21:17,824 --> 01:21:18,592
You are

1297
01:21:18,848 --> 01:21:22,176
The lawyer brings up an email that they sounded discovered

1298
01:21:22,688 --> 01:21:23,968
Shortly after that video

1299
01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:25,760
He was fired because of

1300
01:21:26,272 --> 01:21:26,784
What he was doing

1301
01:21:27,552 --> 01:21:31,136
He wasn't he was doing contract work for smooth either accept

1302
01:21:31,648 --> 01:21:32,416
Or not accept

1303
01:21:33,184 --> 01:21:34,208
And after that you stop

1304
01:21:34,464 --> 01:21:35,232
Accepting

1305
01:21:35,744 --> 01:21:36,512
Stop responding

1306
01:21:39,072 --> 01:21:39,584
Last time

1307
01:21:45,472 --> 01:21:46,240
So it's weird that

1308
01:21:46,752 --> 01:21:47,520
Produced in this case

1309
01:21:47,776 --> 01:21:48,288
For the first time

1310
01:21:48,544 --> 01:21:49,056
Email

1311
01:21:49,312 --> 01:21:50,336
You're involved with

1312
01:21:50,592 --> 01:21:51,872
It has damaged dondi

1313
01:21:52,384 --> 01:21:53,152
Being fired

1314
01:21:53,408 --> 01:21:55,712
For how he was acting at a Donald Trump rally

1315
01:21:55,968 --> 01:21:56,992
In 2016

1316
01:21:59,040 --> 01:21:59,808
Fun fact

1317
01:22:01,600 --> 01:22:05,952
That is a fun fact

1318
01:22:06,208 --> 01:22:12,352
They really should have went faster Discovery stop

1319
01:22:12,608 --> 01:22:16,960
Really screwed by this like we just sent everything over we didn't review anything

1320
01:22:17,216 --> 01:22:23,360
These but the plaintiff lawyers are going to look through all that stuff that's gone to find these things

1321
01:22:23,872 --> 01:22:30,016
Hey you know you said you fired because of this abusive behavior and all that stuff that's a great story but it turns out

1322
01:22:30,272 --> 01:22:34,624
It was because he was acting like an idiot at a trump rally in 2016 you didn't want to be associated

1323
01:22:34,880 --> 01:22:35,392
Right

1324
01:22:35,648 --> 01:22:37,440
So fun fact

1325
01:22:37,952 --> 01:22:44,096
Thank you for bringing that to my attention you personally are on that email today

1326
01:22:44,352 --> 01:22:50,496
I don't I don't I don't recall and I reject of did the FBI send that

1327
01:22:50,752 --> 01:22:51,776
Gmail

1328
01:22:52,544 --> 01:22:58,688
So they get to talkin about this video that Alex put out which is called Sandy Hook vampires exposed

1329
01:22:58,944 --> 01:23:02,272
Bob says he can discuss the sources of that because he worked on it

1330
01:23:02,528 --> 01:23:04,576
Then the Lord brings up something

1331
01:23:04,832 --> 01:23:07,904
Unfortunate that you think vampires are real

1332
01:23:08,160 --> 01:23:08,672
Yes

1333
01:23:11,744 --> 01:23:12,512
2007

1334
01:23:12,768 --> 01:23:13,792
2:19

1335
01:23:14,048 --> 01:23:15,584
Final statement

1336
01:23:15,840 --> 01:23:18,144
Is Sandy Hook vampires

1337
01:23:19,936 --> 01:23:20,704
Do you remember that video

1338
01:23:22,496 --> 01:23:23,776
Who researched the information

1339
01:23:27,360 --> 01:23:27,872
Myself

1340
01:23:28,640 --> 01:23:29,920
What were your symptoms

1341
01:23:31,712 --> 01:23:33,248
Kelly interview

1342
01:23:34,272 --> 01:23:34,784
Any others

1343
01:23:37,856 --> 01:23:38,880
And then I believe previous

1344
01:23:39,136 --> 01:23:40,160
Videos of lucrative

1345
01:23:40,672 --> 01:23:41,952
Are you aware that

1346
01:23:42,208 --> 01:23:42,720
On April

1347
01:23:42,976 --> 01:23:43,744
22nd 2000

1348
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:44,512
17

1349
01:23:45,280 --> 01:23:45,792
Megyn Kelly

1350
01:23:46,048 --> 01:23:46,560
You haven't even had

1351
01:23:50,912 --> 01:23:51,424
Disgusting

1352
01:23:56,288 --> 01:23:58,080
Fun fact

1353
01:23:58,336 --> 01:24:02,432
Yeah the source for that video is Megyn Kelly interview

1354
01:24:02,944 --> 01:24:03,456
Afterwards

1355
01:24:04,736 --> 01:24:09,088
Can I go back and revise my answer to Time Travelers real

1356
01:24:09,344 --> 01:24:10,624
Would that one help

1357
01:24:10,880 --> 01:24:17,024
So I think this is understated but not do his job as a corporate

1358
01:24:17,280 --> 01:24:23,424
Representative that is I can only assume the reason that the interview kept going was just

1359
01:24:23,680 --> 01:24:25,728
Because the lawyer really wanted to expose

1360
01:24:26,240 --> 01:24:26,752
How

1361
01:24:27,008 --> 01:24:27,520
F******

1362
01:24:27,776 --> 01:24:32,896
Shameless it doesn't feel vindictive it don't like they're questioning doesn't

1363
01:24:33,152 --> 01:24:35,200
Xavier too far into like

1364
01:24:35,456 --> 01:24:41,600
I'm going to humiliate you I think the reason that I'm saying that is simply because

1365
01:24:41,856 --> 01:24:45,696
I think if it were me

1366
01:24:45,952 --> 01:24:48,768
In there I probably would try and set more traps

1367
01:24:49,024 --> 01:24:55,168
Do all sorts of crazy if that's your ankles you would go on it but I

1368
01:24:55,424 --> 01:24:58,240
I don't think that they resort to too much

1369
01:24:58,752 --> 01:25:03,360
No but like I said

1370
01:25:05,152 --> 01:25:10,784
Yeah and I would say from the last deposition to this one I see

1371
01:25:11,808 --> 01:25:17,952
Not a market Improvement because I think I'd be condescending for me to say but I see far more what

1372
01:25:18,208 --> 01:25:20,000
They're trying to get in this

1373
01:25:20,256 --> 01:25:21,280
And I think that it

1374
01:25:23,584 --> 01:25:29,728
Problematic for Alex like I think it's much more troubling probably a large part of that is based on the Discovery

1375
01:25:29,984 --> 01:25:31,776
Process moving

1376
01:25:32,032 --> 01:25:36,128
Being able to match up these private Communications along with

1377
01:25:36,384 --> 01:25:39,456
Public statements and I think that they're doing

1378
01:25:39,712 --> 01:25:42,016
Good job

1379
01:25:42,272 --> 01:25:44,832
Unlike Rob do come on

1380
01:25:45,344 --> 01:25:46,112
Where is uranium

1381
01:25:49,952 --> 01:25:50,464
You think

1382
01:25:55,072 --> 01:25:55,584
Without this

1383
01:26:01,728 --> 01:26:03,008
I wouldn't either

1384
01:26:04,288 --> 01:26:04,800
What

1385
01:26:05,312 --> 01:26:07,872
Really really

1386
01:26:08,128 --> 01:26:08,896
Really

1387
01:26:09,152 --> 01:26:15,296
I'm not going to answer that what do you think that was about

1388
01:26:15,552 --> 01:26:18,624
It's a fair question

1389
01:26:18,880 --> 01:26:25,024
Actually I did I didn't really think that's a great question because that is indicative of the entire ethos

1390
01:26:25,280 --> 01:26:31,424
You also wonder to like it's not a question that's meant just a fraud like there's no

1391
01:26:31,680 --> 01:26:35,520
Did exactly what he was supposed to do

1392
01:26:36,032 --> 01:26:40,896
So like I said in the Paul Joseph Watson one there is a

1393
01:26:41,152 --> 01:26:44,224
Attempts to sort out the difference between opinion back

1394
01:26:44,736 --> 01:26:48,832
Presentation of it on the show and it comes back up here with Rob

1395
01:26:49,088 --> 01:26:49,600
Where

1396
01:26:50,112 --> 01:26:51,904
The discussion is broached

1397
01:26:52,928 --> 01:26:56,512
How are people supposed to tell what's reporting in WhatsApp India

1398
01:26:57,024 --> 01:26:58,304
As a journalist

1399
01:26:58,816 --> 01:27:00,864
Don't you have the duty to be right

1400
01:27:01,376 --> 01:27:01,888
And not burst

1401
01:27:10,336 --> 01:27:13,664
We're not always wearing journalistic at sometimes were commenting on

1402
01:27:14,432 --> 01:27:16,480
So when you're commenting on something you just make it up

1403
01:27:16,992 --> 01:27:18,528
It doesn't matter say your opinion

1404
01:27:20,064 --> 01:27:22,624
And anyway is that differentiated on air

1405
01:27:22,880 --> 01:27:24,928
Does mr. Jones say

1406
01:27:25,440 --> 01:27:25,952
Here

1407
01:27:26,208 --> 01:27:27,488
I'm just going to make stuff up

1408
01:27:27,744 --> 01:27:30,048
Here you should trust me because we're truth

1409
01:27:30,304 --> 01:27:30,816
Journalist

1410
01:27:32,864 --> 01:27:33,376
Does he do that

1411
01:27:36,704 --> 01:27:39,520
I think it doesn't play Devil's Advocate as much anymore because of

1412
01:27:42,080 --> 01:27:43,104
Because I got sued

1413
01:27:45,664 --> 01:27:46,688
Do you guys

1414
01:27:47,456 --> 01:27:50,784
Not want to answer my question or do you not understand what question

1415
01:27:51,552 --> 01:27:54,880
I think that question is being asked

1416
01:27:55,136 --> 01:27:56,160
Credibly clearly

1417
01:27:56,672 --> 01:28:00,000
How are you supposed to tell the difference between opinion presented as fact

1418
01:28:00,256 --> 01:28:01,536
And

1419
01:28:02,560 --> 01:28:03,072
Whatever

1420
01:28:03,328 --> 01:28:07,424
Okay they just gave me a very clear question and I'm going to respond with eight

1421
01:28:07,680 --> 01:28:08,704
Time-based question

1422
01:28:08,960 --> 01:28:15,104
Which has nothing to do with it's completely impossible to answer

1423
01:28:15,360 --> 01:28:16,384
A dangerous

1424
01:28:16,896 --> 01:28:18,176
Then for them to

1425
01:28:18,432 --> 01:28:19,712
Infowars to even

1426
01:28:20,480 --> 01:28:24,064
Give a bath

1427
01:28:24,320 --> 01:28:28,160
Because it is every single thing is presented

1428
01:28:28,416 --> 01:28:29,440
100% truth

1429
01:28:29,696 --> 01:28:31,744
You can't you can't unsee

1430
01:28:32,000 --> 01:28:36,608
You can't listen to Alex Jones for any extended period of time without

1431
01:28:36,864 --> 01:28:43,008
Coming away with the impression that he first of all is wrong and second he is absolutely making statements of fact

1432
01:28:45,312 --> 01:28:46,592
Whatever ways

1433
01:28:46,848 --> 01:28:49,408
He can couch it I don't know

1434
01:28:49,664 --> 01:28:50,688
Based on the law

1435
01:28:50,944 --> 01:28:54,528
Where the line is or what's IDs on

1436
01:28:54,784 --> 01:28:56,320
As a consumer of it

1437
01:28:56,576 --> 01:28:58,112
And a listener 2-0

1438
01:28:58,368 --> 01:29:00,672
I have no problem

1439
01:29:00,928 --> 01:29:02,720
Saying that they blur that line

1440
01:29:02,976 --> 01:29:06,560
Perhaps intentionally and it's super unclear

1441
01:29:06,816 --> 01:29:08,352
Because you can you imagine

1442
01:29:08,608 --> 01:29:09,632
If Alex is just like

1443
01:29:09,888 --> 01:29:12,448
Yeah all the stuff is just my

1444
01:29:12,960 --> 01:29:14,496
Yeah that's just my

1445
01:29:14,752 --> 01:29:16,288
Like what I think about this

1446
01:29:16,544 --> 01:29:18,336
I'm not saying that it's based on

1447
01:29:18,592 --> 01:29:24,736
When I say that it's all in the white papers and everything I say is proven right my opinion I believe

1448
01:29:24,992 --> 01:29:26,528
Leave that everything is been proven

1449
01:29:26,784 --> 01:29:29,344
I'm not saying to you that it has been proof

1450
01:29:30,112 --> 01:29:31,392
What is your show then

1451
01:29:32,160 --> 01:29:34,464
Well I mean my opinion is me

1452
01:29:34,720 --> 01:29:37,792
Dang that everything has been proven to you

1453
01:29:38,048 --> 01:29:39,584
Is a statement of opinion

1454
01:29:41,888 --> 01:29:43,680
We will never solve this because

1455
01:29:43,936 --> 01:29:44,960
Circle

1456
01:29:45,472 --> 01:29:48,032
This deposition with Rob do and

1457
01:29:48,288 --> 01:29:50,592
With the lawyer asking if Rob is proud

1458
01:29:50,848 --> 01:29:52,896
Avoiding forward.

1459
01:29:54,688 --> 01:30:00,832
Wait now is that a personal question or is that a question for him as the representative of free speech this might be personal

1460
01:30:01,088 --> 01:30:04,672
So he asked that and Rob's answer

1461
01:30:04,928 --> 01:30:07,488
I think might Loki mean that

1462
01:30:07,744 --> 01:30:08,768
B b b

1463
01:30:09,024 --> 01:30:11,328
Way more of a f*****-up bad dude

1464
01:30:11,584 --> 01:30:12,864
That we pick

1465
01:30:13,120 --> 01:30:14,400
Is this answer is

1466
01:30:14,912 --> 01:30:16,448
Borderline sociopathic

1467
01:30:16,704 --> 01:30:17,984
My last question is

1468
01:30:18,240 --> 01:30:19,008
Sitting here today

1469
01:30:19,520 --> 01:30:20,032
Africa

1470
01:30:21,056 --> 01:30:21,824
Are you proud of

1471
01:30:24,384 --> 01:30:24,896
You don't say

1472
01:30:26,432 --> 01:30:26,944
Will shooting a have

1473
01:30:30,016 --> 01:30:31,552
I think our reporting

1474
01:30:31,808 --> 01:30:33,600
Stop what was going to be

1475
01:30:33,856 --> 01:30:35,136
Anti-gun legislation

1476
01:30:36,416 --> 01:30:36,928
You didn't answer my

1477
01:30:37,184 --> 01:30:37,696
My question

1478
01:30:37,952 --> 01:30:38,976
Question was

1479
01:30:39,232 --> 01:30:40,256
Are you proud

1480
01:30:40,768 --> 01:30:43,328
Of the information that you spread about Sandy

1481
01:30:45,632 --> 01:30:46,400
2012

1482
01:30:47,424 --> 01:30:47,936
2007

1483
01:30:54,080 --> 01:30:54,592
As a company

1484
01:30:56,896 --> 01:30:57,664
Is that what you wanted

1485
01:31:01,248 --> 01:31:01,760
I don't think we're going to

1486
01:31:03,808 --> 01:31:04,320
What do you think

1487
01:31:06,880 --> 01:31:07,648
That's what you want

1488
01:31:12,256 --> 01:31:13,024
I think

1489
01:31:13,280 --> 01:31:16,608
That when you're being asked are you proud of this

1490
01:31:17,120 --> 01:31:20,448
You should not have like if you don't want to show ass

1491
01:31:20,704 --> 01:31:24,544
There's enough there's some sort of an answer you could give that's not yes or no

1492
01:31:24,800 --> 01:31:30,944
Your mistakes were made you going to are you

1493
01:31:31,200 --> 01:31:37,344
Proud of every mistake that you've ever made

1494
01:31:37,600 --> 01:31:42,208
Presented by other people as a complete

1495
01:31:42,464 --> 01:31:47,840
Credible Source times you believe people who aren't you shouldn't believe

1496
01:31:48,096 --> 01:31:49,888
You can do whatever you want

1497
01:31:50,656 --> 01:31:56,800
He's answer being I believe that there was a lot of gun legislation that we stop yeah

1498
01:31:57,056 --> 01:31:58,848
By lying about Sandy ad

1499
01:31:59,360 --> 01:32:05,504
So expect an end justify the meme arguments to do are you saying that you spread

1500
01:32:05,760 --> 01:32:08,832
False information in order to achieve a political result

1501
01:32:09,344 --> 01:32:11,392
Do you know we have a word for the that

1502
01:32:11,648 --> 01:32:14,976
I mean it does seem to imply that he doesn't have

1503
01:32:15,232 --> 01:32:16,256
Qualms with

1504
01:32:16,512 --> 01:32:19,072
Like putting out false information if it's

1505
01:32:19,328 --> 01:32:20,608
Expedient to his goal

1506
01:32:20,864 --> 01:32:22,144
Yeah and that to me

1507
01:32:22,656 --> 01:32:23,424
Underoath

1508
01:32:23,680 --> 01:32:27,264
Yep speaking for the company sure he's not good now

1509
01:32:27,520 --> 01:32:28,800
Yeah I guess

1510
01:32:29,056 --> 01:32:33,664
Haven't you said hey we stopped a gun legislation honestly

1511
01:32:33,920 --> 01:32:38,016
I don't know if kerbals would have said he was proud of the misinformation

1512
01:32:38,272 --> 01:32:40,576
Consider like

1513
01:32:41,088 --> 01:32:45,184
These gun paranoia fears that they've had over the

1514
01:32:45,440 --> 01:32:46,208
Decades

1515
01:32:46,464 --> 01:32:46,976
Like

1516
01:32:47,232 --> 01:32:52,608
They didn't need to fake something like this they didn't have to engage in this to stop that legislation

1517
01:32:53,120 --> 01:32:57,472
Play kirtans of money from the anti-gravity

1518
01:32:57,728 --> 01:32:59,264
B effective

1519
01:33:00,032 --> 01:33:00,800
Gun

1520
01:33:01,312 --> 01:33:03,616
Advocacy groups do enough

1521
01:33:03,872 --> 01:33:06,944
To make sure that a lot of that legislation doesn't pass

1522
01:33:07,200 --> 01:33:08,224
You don't need

1523
01:33:08,480 --> 01:33:14,624
People like Alex doing this sort of delusion

1524
01:33:14,880 --> 01:33:20,000
Dollars on lobbying directly to congressmen and essentially have purchased their votes

1525
01:33:21,792 --> 01:33:24,352
Did the NRA ever

1526
01:33:24,608 --> 01:33:27,168
He lie about a mass shooting

1527
01:33:27,680 --> 01:33:29,472
B of A

1528
01:33:29,728 --> 01:33:32,288
Deposition is

1529
01:33:32,544 --> 01:33:33,056
Like this

1530
01:33:33,312 --> 01:33:36,384
Real spectacle of incompetence and

1531
01:33:36,640 --> 01:33:40,224
Disrespect that I find really interesting I find it to be

1532
01:33:40,736 --> 01:33:41,248
Like

1533
01:33:42,784 --> 01:33:44,320
Like a real low point

1534
01:33:44,832 --> 01:33:47,904
These depositions in particular

1535
01:33:48,160 --> 01:33:50,208
Types of potential the sources

1536
01:33:50,464 --> 01:33:56,608
Find out information about Rob do with a backwards beanie on just being like

1537
01:33:56,864 --> 01:33:57,376
Do anything

1538
01:33:57,632 --> 01:33:58,912
You're speaking as a company

1539
01:33:59,168 --> 01:34:00,704
The company doesn't know anything

1540
01:34:01,984 --> 01:34:02,752
That's so funny

1541
01:34:03,264 --> 01:34:06,592
Yeah I didn't at least it was just because if anybody

1542
01:34:06,848 --> 01:34:08,128
Had ever given me

1543
01:34:09,408 --> 01:34:10,944
We are going to depose you

1544
01:34:11,456 --> 01:34:13,760
You're the stuff here's the stuff you need to know

1545
01:34:14,016 --> 01:34:19,136
I would have done the s*** out of my homework so nervous yeah

1546
01:34:19,392 --> 01:34:23,488
They're going to depose me I'm under oath I better get my facts right

1547
01:34:23,744 --> 01:34:25,280
And these people are just like

1548
01:34:29,120 --> 01:34:31,168
We had Paul Joseph Watson is the opener

1549
01:34:31,424 --> 01:34:33,472
Rob do is the feature right

1550
01:34:33,984 --> 01:34:39,616
Which is the best spot as as clearly as tradition we got our headliner

1551
01:34:39,872 --> 01:34:43,456
That is a course Alex Jones being under deposed again

1552
01:34:43,712 --> 01:34:46,016
So we had like these

1553
01:34:47,040 --> 01:34:51,392
Paul probably was about an hour-long deposition robbed is about an hour 40

1554
01:34:51,904 --> 01:34:53,440
Alex is almost 3 hours

1555
01:34:54,464 --> 01:34:55,488
Him under oath

1556
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:59,584
A large part of the beginning of it is discussing like

1557
01:35:00,096 --> 01:35:04,192
What means did people communicate with each other internally it Infowars

1558
01:35:04,704 --> 01:35:08,800
Which is to try and be like do we have all these internal communication

1559
01:35:09,056 --> 01:35:09,824
Email

1560
01:35:10,080 --> 01:35:11,872
August did y'all use Slack

1561
01:35:12,128 --> 01:35:14,944
That kind of thing and Alex is very

1562
01:35:15,200 --> 01:35:18,528
Wishy-washy about all of this

1563
01:35:19,040 --> 01:35:19,808
What's Slack

1564
01:35:22,880 --> 01:35:23,904
So he can eat in this

1565
01:35:24,160 --> 01:35:28,000
Cooper sklepy claims that he's never texted with anybody about

1566
01:35:29,024 --> 01:35:34,912
So you're saying you never receive text messages relating to Sandy Hook as your testimony the same that you've never sent a text message

1567
01:35:45,664 --> 01:35:46,432
Or something

1568
01:35:47,968 --> 01:35:49,504
Talk about Sandy Hook

1569
01:35:50,528 --> 01:35:52,576
I very rarely talk about Sandy Hook.

1570
01:35:53,344 --> 01:35:56,416
So your testimony as you've never sent a towel

1571
01:35:56,672 --> 01:35:58,208
Text message relating to send you a

1572
01:35:58,464 --> 01:36:00,256
To a fellow employee resource

1573
01:36:00,512 --> 01:36:01,024
You're somebody else

1574
01:36:08,192 --> 01:36:08,704
Okay

1575
01:36:08,960 --> 01:36:15,104
That seems to be in direct contradiction to Paul Joseph Watson sent to Buckley in

1576
01:36:15,360 --> 01:36:19,968
Which was a like a on the record version of a text

1577
01:36:20,224 --> 01:36:21,504
Listen to Alex

1578
01:36:21,760 --> 01:36:24,064
Yeah I'm glad I was literally waiting for him to be like

1579
01:36:24,320 --> 01:36:29,440
And here's the text you provided us but I don't think he needs to

1580
01:36:29,696 --> 01:36:35,584
I don't think that the lawyers need to bring that out you just need like here's Alex being deposed as it's not

1581
01:36:37,632 --> 01:36:43,776
So one of the angles that I thought was really interesting at the beginning of this conversation with Alex he's getting into

1582
01:36:44,288 --> 01:36:50,432
You ever disciplined anybody hit Infowars we just talked to him

1583
01:36:50,688 --> 01:36:56,832
Could use a little question is all about weather

1584
01:36:57,088 --> 01:37:03,232
Someone has put out. Where's the question is

1585
01:37:03,488 --> 01:37:09,632
More just like have you disciplined anyone for anything

1586
01:37:09,888 --> 01:37:11,424
Sienna

1587
01:37:12,192 --> 01:37:13,216
Let's talk about

1588
01:37:13,728 --> 01:37:15,776
Request for production number three on page 4

1589
01:37:22,432 --> 01:37:23,712
This request

Apparently

1605
01:37:49,056 --> 01:37:49,824
None

1606
01:37:50,080 --> 01:37:51,872
No one has been disciplined

1607
01:37:52,128 --> 01:37:57,760
The stuff I mean it does really feel like their defense

1608
01:37:58,784 --> 01:38:04,160
Yeah I'm at I still think that's all I can say that doesn't get you off the hook for those course not

1609
01:38:04,416 --> 01:38:06,208
No that's what I'm saying I

1610
01:38:06,464 --> 01:38:09,536
I think they I think they know they're going to lose because

1611
01:38:09,792 --> 01:38:13,888
Of course they are

1612
01:38:14,400 --> 01:38:15,424
F****** let's

1613
01:38:15,936 --> 01:38:20,032
Let's push this back as long as possible with Rises out of Erie frame this

1614
01:38:20,800 --> 01:38:23,360
It's not necessarily that they think they're going to lose

1615
01:38:23,616 --> 01:38:24,896
But they

1616
01:38:25,408 --> 01:38:26,432
I get the sense that

1617
01:38:26,688 --> 01:38:32,320
They think it's more likely outcome than they might have previously

1618
01:38:34,624 --> 01:38:37,952
Not surrender is not giving up or anything like that but

1619
01:38:39,232 --> 01:38:40,000
He's weird

1620
01:38:40,256 --> 01:38:42,048
This hinge of

1621
01:38:42,304 --> 01:38:43,328
Call opinion

1622
01:38:43,584 --> 01:38:45,120
Yeah kind of thing is

1623
01:38:45,376 --> 01:38:50,752
Not what you'd want to do if your Infowars you don't want to testify and then put on oath

1624
01:38:52,544 --> 01:38:55,360
I'm not talking back to you

1625
01:38:55,616 --> 01:39:01,760
I mean yeah but by their own definition of facts nobody is going to Care listen to them because they're just going to say

1626
01:39:02,016 --> 01:39:03,040
What using

1627
01:39:03,296 --> 01:39:06,112
Like facts are not going to convince anyone

1628
01:39:07,136 --> 01:39:07,648
Maybe

1629
01:39:07,904 --> 01:39:11,232
So it before we get to some more talk about disciplining

1630
01:39:11,488 --> 01:39:15,584
Employees we get to this idea of what is an opinion

1631
01:39:15,840 --> 01:39:16,864
And what is fact

1632
01:39:18,656 --> 01:39:20,192
See if Alex knows the diff

1633
01:39:21,216 --> 01:39:25,568
Okay what would you think Sandy Hook is not an operating school you think that's an opinion

1634
01:39:28,896 --> 01:39:34,528
I'm just saying right now if I told you I said you wasn't an operating school

1635
01:39:37,088 --> 01:39:38,368
Not what I meant

1636
01:39:38,624 --> 01:39:39,904
I see that

1637
01:39:40,160 --> 01:39:42,208
I'm asking you if I said to you

1638
01:39:42,976 --> 01:39:44,768
Right now I'm going to say it to you right now

1639
01:39:45,280 --> 01:39:46,048
Mr. Jones

1640
01:39:46,560 --> 01:39:47,328
Sandy Hook

1641
01:39:47,584 --> 01:39:48,864
Wasn't an operating school

1642
01:39:49,632 --> 01:39:50,912
Did I just make a statement

1643
01:39:51,168 --> 01:39:52,192
Or did I just make an opinion

1644
01:39:59,872 --> 01:40:02,176
So those sorts of statements can be set on Infowars

1645
01:40:02,432 --> 01:40:03,200
Without socks

1646
01:40:06,016 --> 01:40:06,784
Contacts

1647
01:40:07,552 --> 01:40:11,648
So the reason that he's trying to nail this down is because

1648
01:40:11,904 --> 01:40:18,048
Trying to get the sense of like if you're an employee for Infowars if you want to just say something on air is there

1649
01:40:18,304 --> 01:40:19,328
There any kind of

1650
01:40:20,096 --> 01:40:23,424
I believe prior constraint is there anytime

1651
01:40:23,680 --> 01:40:27,776
How would you go about making a claim like Sandy Hook wasn't open

1652
01:40:28,288 --> 01:40:28,800
On air

1653
01:40:29,056 --> 01:40:32,640
And it turns out well they said it

1654
01:40:33,152 --> 01:40:34,688
Except that in that is not enough

1655
01:40:34,944 --> 01:40:39,808
That is something that is eat that has a truth value attached to it

1656
01:40:40,320 --> 01:40:41,344
And

1657
01:40:41,856 --> 01:40:43,904
That I think is

1658
01:40:44,416 --> 01:40:49,024
One of the clear thing that comes out to me in the course of all of these depositions

1659
01:40:49,536 --> 01:40:52,608
Is a staunch refusal to understand or accept

1660
01:40:52,864 --> 01:40:55,424
But there is a difference between a fact and

1661
01:40:55,936 --> 01:40:59,776
Yeah I don't think that these I think that there's a strategic reason for it

1662
01:41:00,288 --> 01:41:02,592
But I also think that there's a possibility that they

1663
01:41:03,104 --> 01:41:05,664
Like sincerely don't quite grasp

1664
01:41:05,920 --> 01:41:06,944
I genuinely

1665
01:41:08,224 --> 01:41:13,856
I really I really don't think they do and if we're going by if I'm going by that like

1666
01:41:14,112 --> 01:41:16,928
They're the weakest link in this propaganda name

1667
01:41:17,184 --> 01:41:21,536
I think they're low enough on the totem pole where they're convinced that there is no

1668
01:41:22,304 --> 01:41:23,840
You know like higher up

1669
01:41:24,096 --> 01:41:30,240
In the in the upper echelons of journalists at Fox News who are opinion people have

1670
01:41:30,496 --> 01:41:33,824
Fox News they have to be aware that they're not telling the truth

1671
01:41:34,080 --> 01:41:37,152
But these guys generally don't believe there is an AA truth

1672
01:41:37,408 --> 01:41:43,552
Yeah and I don't believe there's a place it's really hard for me to tell because it is it seem

1673
01:41:43,808 --> 01:41:44,576
Possible

1674
01:41:44,832 --> 01:41:45,856
That there is

1675
01:41:46,112 --> 01:41:51,488
An inability or unwillingness to understand the different on their part and it's possible

1676
01:41:52,000 --> 01:41:58,144
But I can't really necessarily believe that because I also think that it's exactly the last Refuge you would

1677
01:41:58,400 --> 01:42:04,544
It is where you would go if you like well everything is indefensible and my behavior is

1678
01:42:04,800 --> 01:42:05,312
Clearly

1679
01:42:05,568 --> 01:42:09,664
Shown to be bucked up yeah there's opinion

1680
01:42:10,944 --> 01:42:14,016
Right exactly where you would try and hide out

1681
01:42:14,528 --> 01:42:20,672
That's true I mean obviously they can't combat it with any kind of facts

1682
01:42:20,928 --> 01:42:26,304
Cuz there is a functional used to find it hard to believe that it's just like

1683
01:42:27,072 --> 01:42:29,888
Inability to recognize reality

1684
01:42:30,144 --> 01:42:33,984
Yeah if it didn't serve a purpose that maybe like that's fine

1685
01:42:34,240 --> 01:42:40,384
But that's something that I hear so often from a lot of people is that

1686
01:42:40,640 --> 01:42:41,664
Baseline beliefs

1687
01:42:42,688 --> 01:42:46,016
I don't know I think it's a combination of

1688
01:42:46,528 --> 01:42:47,040
You know

1689
01:42:47,552 --> 01:42:50,880
Purposeful ignorance along with a

1690
01:42:51,136 --> 01:42:54,208
Willingness

1691
01:42:54,720 --> 01:42:55,232
What is it

1692
01:42:55,488 --> 01:43:00,352
Constant bombardment of this as true you know like they

1693
01:43:00,864 --> 01:43:02,912
Somebody repeated it often enough

1694
01:43:03,168 --> 01:43:08,800
And I don't want to really engage with effect of repetition isn't reality so

1695
01:43:09,312 --> 01:43:10,080
I meant to say that it's

1696
01:43:10,592 --> 01:43:12,640
Yeah like that's kind of their operating see

1697
01:43:14,688 --> 01:43:17,760
We get back to these employees who have not been

1698
01:43:18,016 --> 01:43:19,296
Discipline at all

1699
01:43:19,552 --> 01:43:21,088
And we get some example

1700
01:43:21,856 --> 01:43:22,624
What's an editor

1701
01:43:23,136 --> 01:43:24,416
Publishes an accusation

1702
01:43:25,184 --> 01:43:26,208
That someone is acrimony

1703
01:43:27,232 --> 01:43:29,280
And in doing so they relied on a source

1704
01:43:29,536 --> 01:43:30,048
Whose identity

1705
01:43:30,560 --> 01:43:31,584
They cannot verify

1706
01:43:31,840 --> 01:43:33,120
I have no idea who it is

1707
01:43:33,632 --> 01:43:34,656
A totally anonymous

1708
01:43:36,192 --> 01:43:37,216
And then it turns out

1709
01:43:37,472 --> 01:43:38,752
That that recording was full

1710
01:43:39,776 --> 01:43:41,312
Is that okay

1711
01:43:41,824 --> 01:43:43,616
You would take disciplinary action if that

1712
01:43:46,688 --> 01:43:48,480
No what kind of display

1713
01:43:51,040 --> 01:43:53,856
General a district-wide

1714
01:43:55,648 --> 01:43:57,440
Know when kit Daniels

1715
01:43:58,720 --> 01:43:59,488
Randonautica

1716
01:44:00,768 --> 01:44:03,840
Accusing an innocent young man

1717
01:44:04,352 --> 01:44:05,632
Based on a

1718
01:44:06,656 --> 01:44:07,680
Whiskey could not verify

1719
01:44:08,704 --> 01:44:09,984
You didn't fire him.

1720
01:44:14,336 --> 01:44:16,640
That that individuals name was not put out

1721
01:44:17,152 --> 01:44:17,664
Bad

1722
01:44:17,920 --> 01:44:18,944
It was from another

1723
01:44:25,344 --> 01:44:26,624
In the record

1724
01:44:31,232 --> 01:44:32,768
On purpose

1725
01:44:36,096 --> 01:44:39,936
He intentionally on purpose recorded an accusation of a crime

1726
01:44:40,448 --> 01:44:41,984
Based on an anonymous source

1727
01:44:42,240 --> 01:44:43,776
Whose identity he could not verify

1728
01:44:44,288 --> 01:44:44,800
Correct

1729
01:44:45,568 --> 01:44:46,592
No it was a

1730
01:44:50,944 --> 01:44:51,456
The match

1731
01:44:55,296 --> 01:44:56,576
What sites are you talking about

1732
01:45:00,416 --> 01:45:01,440
Before Kate Daniels public

1733
01:45:02,464 --> 01:45:03,744
That's your belief

1734
01:45:09,632 --> 01:45:10,400
Insulting a tweet

1735
01:45:10,656 --> 01:45:11,424
Define anonymous

1736
01:45:11,680 --> 01:45:12,192
Twitter account

1737
01:45:12,704 --> 01:45:13,984
But I do remember that

1738
01:45:15,264 --> 01:45:16,288
If if that was true though

1739
01:45:17,056 --> 01:45:17,568
If he just

1740
01:45:17,824 --> 01:45:18,336
Relied on

1741
01:45:18,592 --> 01:45:19,616
Two Anonymous sources

1742
01:45:19,872 --> 01:45:21,408
Identity could not verify

1743
01:45:22,432 --> 01:45:23,968
That's a fireable offense

1744
01:45:29,344 --> 01:45:31,136
That's not good

1745
01:45:31,904 --> 01:45:33,184
I cannot believe

1746
01:45:33,440 --> 01:45:39,584
That he is not clever enough to sense that a hypothetical question is going to lead to a literal question

1747
01:45:39,840 --> 01:45:45,984
That is insane to me that he's answering that question honestly as a guy

1748
01:45:46,240 --> 01:45:47,520
Answer that

1749
01:45:47,776 --> 01:45:49,824
Answer a hypothetical

1750
01:45:50,080 --> 01:45:55,200
It's not like he's going to ask you a hypothetical question that's going to exonerate probably not

1751
01:45:55,456 --> 01:45:59,552
So yes that one and then there's another example

1752
01:46:00,064 --> 01:46:03,392
You didn't take disciplinary action against any employee involved in the false

1753
01:46:03,648 --> 01:46:04,928
Recording on the Chobani yogurt

1754
01:46:05,696 --> 01:46:06,464
You publicly apologized

1755
01:46:16,192 --> 01:46:22,336
That was a publicity stunt by Chobani yogurt Norristown money it was altogether there were migrant workers being brought in there were right

1756
01:46:24,128 --> 01:46:24,640
Self

1757
01:46:27,200 --> 01:46:28,480
The Reserve Board member

1758
01:46:28,992 --> 01:46:29,760
What

1759
01:46:30,016 --> 01:46:32,832
Didn't David tell you supposedly that there were no right

1760
01:46:33,344 --> 01:46:33,856
That was false

1761
01:46:35,136 --> 01:46:39,488
I don't know what you're talkin about

1762
01:46:40,768 --> 01:46:46,912
He just commit another cross I'm not entirely sure it does seem like Underoath

1763
01:46:47,168 --> 01:46:50,496
He just said that Leah was

1764
01:46:50,752 --> 01:46:54,080
Involved

1765
01:46:54,336 --> 01:46:57,920
I wonder is that a violation of

1766
01:46:58,432 --> 01:47:03,040
Seems like it would there's no way that it's like oh you can't say it publicly however

1767
01:47:03,296 --> 01:47:09,184
In a deposition in another lawsuit it would be totally fine and when it's released on the internet we won't consider that

1768
01:47:09,696 --> 01:47:11,488
Haha yeah that's insane

1769
01:47:11,744 --> 01:47:12,768
Until you got that

1770
01:47:13,280 --> 01:47:19,424
Really f***** up answer and then also a demonstration didn't know when the whole Chobani thing haven't no one was

1771
01:47:22,496 --> 01:47:23,264
That's bananas

1772
01:47:23,520 --> 01:47:25,824
I'm starting to think that that public

1773
01:47:26,848 --> 01:47:28,640
Genuine

1774
01:47:29,152 --> 01:47:31,968
So

1775
01:47:32,224 --> 01:47:33,760
Any disciplinary actions about

1776
01:47:34,016 --> 01:47:35,808
When your recorder Owen Shroyer

1777
01:47:36,320 --> 01:47:37,600
Tried to falsely connect

1778
01:47:37,856 --> 01:47:39,392
The Austin pizza restaurant

1779
01:47:39,648 --> 01:47:41,952
Eastside pies to a pedophile ring

1780
01:47:42,464 --> 01:47:43,744
You didn't take any disciplinary action

1781
01:47:45,024 --> 01:47:45,536
Correct

1782
01:47:50,400 --> 01:47:55,776
You never taken any disciplinary action against any employee for any of the false things

1783
01:47:56,032 --> 01:47:57,312
Said about Sandy Hook on

1784
01:47:57,568 --> 01:47:58,080
Infowars

1785
01:48:16,512 --> 01:48:21,888
Pretty clear what I'm getting at

1786
01:48:22,144 --> 01:48:28,288
That you create environment where everybody is not in all punished for putting out

1787
01:48:29,312 --> 01:48:35,456
Impact player actively encouraged to do so seems like that's the pattern how do you know

1788
01:48:35,712 --> 01:48:36,736
Not know what I'm getting

1789
01:48:36,992 --> 01:48:39,040
I am very clearly leaving you

1790
01:48:39,296 --> 01:48:45,440
That's that's why is Aurelia so like come on man

1791
01:48:45,696 --> 01:48:48,512
So then he comes up

1792
01:48:48,768 --> 01:48:53,888
And of course Alex wants to downplay his relationship with the Kraken

1793
01:48:54,400 --> 01:48:55,424
Okay that's mr. batondy

1794
01:48:55,936 --> 01:48:56,704
Yes I think

1795
01:48:58,240 --> 01:49:00,032
That's the man that

1796
01:49:00,544 --> 01:49:02,080
Enforce it to Newtown

1797
01:49:02,848 --> 01:49:04,384
Report on Sandy Hook in 2040

1798
01:49:04,896 --> 01:49:05,408
Correct

1799
01:49:15,904 --> 01:49:16,928
Listen to Boston

1800
01:49:18,464 --> 01:49:19,488
Do Infowars

1801
01:49:20,256 --> 01:49:21,280
Sent him to Sandy

1802
01:49:22,816 --> 01:49:23,584
In 2014

1803
01:49:23,840 --> 01:49:24,352
Right

1804
01:49:28,192 --> 01:49:29,472
Cavity did reporting

1805
01:49:29,728 --> 01:49:30,496
4 + 4

1806
01:49:30,752 --> 01:49:31,520
In 2014

1807
01:49:31,776 --> 01:49:32,544
Incendia

1808
01:49:33,056 --> 01:49:35,104
He was working for

1809
01:49:35,872 --> 01:49:36,896
He wasn't your reporter

1810
01:49:40,736 --> 01:49:41,504
You're very handsome

1811
01:49:44,320 --> 01:49:50,464
He certainly has that was certainly heard him described

1812
01:49:50,720 --> 01:49:51,488
Same place right

1813
01:49:51,744 --> 01:49:53,280
That is an opinion

1814
01:49:55,328 --> 01:49:56,096
Zoe's

1815
01:49:56,352 --> 01:49:58,912
Alex tries to play the same game

1816
01:49:59,168 --> 01:50:05,312
That like a Rob do does and that is that our sense of decency was offended by what their padabi was up to

1817
01:50:05,824 --> 01:50:07,104
So we told him to suck off

1818
01:50:08,128 --> 01:50:11,200
What did you think of mr. madani's work in Newtown in 2014

1819
01:50:16,064 --> 01:50:17,600
I did not follow

1820
01:50:18,880 --> 01:50:19,648
Okay when you

1821
01:50:20,160 --> 01:50:22,464
Did find out about it what was your reaction would you do

1822
01:50:27,584 --> 01:50:28,864
I don't remember the specific

1823
01:50:30,144 --> 01:50:34,752
When you testified back in March didn't you say that you would seen what he did had a reaction to it

1824
01:50:35,776 --> 01:50:37,312
Are you talkin about this report

1825
01:50:37,568 --> 01:50:40,128
Talking about support

1826
01:50:40,384 --> 01:50:42,176
What you think about is work in Newtown in 2014

1827
01:50:45,248 --> 01:50:48,576
Do not get your you're not reporting for us to stop using the bi flag

1828
01:50:52,928 --> 01:50:58,048
E-year okay yeah

1829
01:50:59,072 --> 01:51:01,632
I like your demeanor Kraken

1830
01:51:03,168 --> 01:51:05,216
The guy who I specifically praise

1831
01:51:05,472 --> 01:51:11,616
Or his demeanor I might as well have created statue because he disrupted Boston

1832
01:51:11,872 --> 01:51:13,408
Related press conferences

1833
01:51:13,664 --> 01:51:16,736
I didn't like the way you was carrying themselves this is unreal

1834
01:51:16,992 --> 01:51:19,296
So ridiculous I don't understand

1835
01:51:19,552 --> 01:51:20,320
Why there

1836
01:51:20,576 --> 01:51:22,624
Why is Alex doing both

1837
01:51:22,880 --> 01:51:26,720
Trying to do both the I don't recall and answer the

1838
01:51:27,744 --> 01:51:32,864
Because I think it's hubris I think I think that sometimes he feels like

1839
01:51:33,120 --> 01:51:35,168
I can handle this

1840
01:51:35,424 --> 01:51:37,472
Feels that way a little bit

1841
01:51:38,240 --> 01:51:44,384
No because Rob he's not prepared he hasn't

1842
01:51:44,640 --> 01:51:45,920
Just really sorted out

1843
01:51:46,176 --> 01:51:52,320
There is a part of like I don't understand what you're getting at is kind of

1844
01:51:52,576 --> 01:51:58,720
Stand some of the lines of questioning and what their purpose right you didn't discipline any

1845
01:51:58,976 --> 01:52:01,536
Give your employees for instances of

1846
01:52:01,792 --> 01:52:05,376
Being lazy be happy being irresponsible

1847
01:52:05,632 --> 01:52:07,424
There's a point to that line of questioning

1848
01:52:07,680 --> 01:52:10,240
In the same way with Dan baton do you like bringing

1849
01:52:10,496 --> 01:52:12,032
Him up there's a reason

1850
01:52:12,288 --> 01:52:16,640
They were going down this road were there depositions in the Home Depot

1851
01:52:17,152 --> 01:52:23,296
I don't think it proceeded to that point you can be settled before

1852
01:52:23,552 --> 01:52:25,344
Any became public

1853
01:52:25,600 --> 01:52:26,112
Yeah

1854
01:52:26,368 --> 01:52:28,416
Cuz it kind of feels to me like

1855
01:52:28,928 --> 01:52:31,744
The advice that they must be operating

1856
01:52:33,024 --> 01:52:34,304
This is going to settle

1857
01:52:34,816 --> 01:52:37,888
So don't worry too much about react yeah

1858
01:52:38,400 --> 01:52:44,544
We're going to settle this the same way that we did with the other law I forgot what BART it's going to cost you money

1859
01:52:44,800 --> 01:52:49,920
Yeah anything else just said that I would die before I give into the sea

1860
01:52:50,432 --> 01:52:53,248
I will not be taking down by yogurt never

1861
01:52:53,504 --> 01:52:55,040
So Alex

1862
01:52:55,552 --> 01:52:57,600
Get another line of

1863
01:52:58,112 --> 01:52:59,904
Very consistent is

1864
01:53:00,160 --> 01:53:04,768
That I don't believe that the lawyers think that Alex has any sources

1865
01:53:05,024 --> 01:53:05,536
Really

1866
01:53:05,792 --> 01:53:08,864
Outside of Wolfgang halbig Jim Fetzer

1867
01:53:09,120 --> 01:53:11,424
They seem to be pretty clear

1868
01:53:11,680 --> 01:53:13,728
That like any any question

1869
01:53:14,240 --> 01:53:17,056
Kind of traces back to them a little

1870
01:53:17,312 --> 01:53:18,336
And so on

1871
01:53:18,592 --> 01:53:21,152
Really wants you to know that Jim Fetzer wasn't thesaurus

1872
01:53:21,408 --> 01:53:24,480
In addition to Wolfgang halbig one of your other sources

1873
01:53:24,736 --> 01:53:26,784
Recording with Jim Fetzer

1874
01:53:37,792 --> 01:53:40,352
Fitness professor

1875
01:53:40,608 --> 01:53:41,888
He was one of the people questioning

1876
01:53:42,656 --> 01:53:44,960
One of your sources for Sanyo coverage correct

1877
01:53:49,312 --> 01:53:50,592
Remember

1878
01:53:50,848 --> 01:53:51,872
Call my show

1879
01:53:52,640 --> 01:53:56,480
Can you testify that mr. Watson was telling you that Mr Fetzer was bad

1880
01:53:59,552 --> 01:54:00,576
You shouldn't be relying on them

1881
01:54:03,392 --> 01:54:06,720
I remember Paul saying that like that's alright.

1882
01:54:07,744 --> 01:54:11,584
Mr. Fetzer is a retired professor in a rabid anti-semite

1883
01:54:12,096 --> 01:54:12,608
Right

1884
01:54:15,424 --> 01:54:17,728
You didn't know mr. Fetzer was a rabid anti-semite

1885
01:54:20,032 --> 01:54:22,592
You didn't know that Mr Saatchi thinks the Jews did Sandy

1886
01:54:23,360 --> 01:54:25,920
Just like the Jews did 9/11

1887
01:54:30,016 --> 01:54:33,344
Alexandra Lee know more about the the world's that he dwells in

1888
01:54:33,600 --> 01:54:34,880
It seems like it would be helpful to him

1889
01:54:35,136 --> 01:54:35,648
This is banana

1890
01:54:36,416 --> 01:54:42,560
So in the deposition know the name of the guy that they fingered as the

1891
01:54:42,816 --> 01:54:48,448
Parkland shooter which is crazy because in all of this

1892
01:54:48,704 --> 01:54:50,496
Negative attention these lawsuits

1893
01:54:50,752 --> 01:54:54,336
You would think that this would be something that like okay we got to cover our bases on

1894
01:54:54,592 --> 01:54:56,384
Yeah recognize the guys name

1895
01:54:56,896 --> 01:54:58,432
Now Alex doesn't know somebody

1896
01:54:58,944 --> 01:55:01,504
You remember at the end of the 2016 election

1897
01:55:03,040 --> 01:55:03,808
Media coverage

1898
01:55:04,320 --> 01:55:08,672
About how you would sit on your show that trumpet calls you and thank you for your help in the election

1899
01:55:09,952 --> 01:55:13,792
Some of those mainstream media sources were

1900
01:55:14,304 --> 01:55:14,816
You remember.

1901
01:55:15,072 --> 01:55:15,584
Yes

1902
01:55:17,888 --> 01:55:18,400
2 days

1903
01:55:18,656 --> 01:55:21,984
After that happened a woman named Erica Lafferty

1904
01:55:25,056 --> 01:55:26,080
Yoo-hoo

1905
01:55:28,384 --> 01:55:30,432
The daughter of dawn offspring

1906
01:55:30,688 --> 01:55:32,224
She currently suing you you don't know who she is

1907
01:55:36,320 --> 01:55:36,832
Okay

1908
01:55:38,880 --> 01:55:39,648
You didn't know that

1909
01:55:40,416 --> 01:55:42,208
Can you didn't notice she currently

1910
01:55:42,464 --> 01:55:44,512
Is the named plaintiff in a suit against you in Connecticut

1911
01:55:45,536 --> 01:55:48,096
Call Lafferty versus Jones

1912
01:55:49,376 --> 01:55:50,912
Oh I've seen that name

1913
01:55:52,192 --> 01:55:52,704
Crazy

1914
01:55:53,728 --> 01:55:57,824
I don't even understand how you can be that level of

1915
01:55:58,080 --> 01:56:04,224
Cuz it doesn't feel like that's not a genuine answer a genuinely believe he has no idea

1916
01:56:04,480 --> 01:56:10,624
It seems like

1917
01:56:10,880 --> 01:56:13,184
When he's lying or trying to find a way to lie but now

1918
01:56:13,440 --> 01:56:16,256
Deposits for about 45 280

1919
01:56:16,768 --> 01:56:18,816
There is a there is a strange

1920
01:56:19,072 --> 01:56:22,144
Enable just goes to the larger picture of like what I see is

1921
01:56:22,400 --> 01:56:22,912
Like just

1922
01:56:23,168 --> 01:56:24,192
Late disrespect

1923
01:56:24,448 --> 01:56:24,960
Gohan

1924
01:56:25,216 --> 01:56:31,360
By these people

1925
01:56:31,616 --> 01:56:32,128
They would

1926
01:56:32,384 --> 01:56:32,896
Actually be

1927
01:56:33,920 --> 01:56:40,064
They have they have to balloon explain the lack of preparation advice

1928
01:56:40,320 --> 01:56:45,952
It's possible or they just thought like these does go put these out

1929
01:56:46,208 --> 01:56:47,488
Will just be able to

1930
01:56:47,744 --> 01:56:50,048
You know keep this under wraps wow

1931
01:56:50,560 --> 01:56:51,328
So this is

1932
01:56:51,840 --> 01:56:53,888
The lawyer plays a video of Alex's

1933
01:56:54,144 --> 01:56:54,656
2060

1934
01:56:55,168 --> 01:57:01,056
In italics is discussing some of the evidence and some of the reasons why you know

1935
01:57:01,312 --> 01:57:02,848
Your suspicions around San Diego

1936
01:57:03,616 --> 01:57:04,640
And this is one of them

1937
01:57:04,896 --> 01:57:05,664
But the biggest

1938
01:57:05,920 --> 01:57:08,224
Piece of The Smoking Gun if you would

1939
01:57:08,736 --> 01:57:09,248
Avocado

01:57:22,304 --> 01:57:23,328
All the sudden

1946
01:57:25,632 --> 01:57:27,424
It's impossible to have zero traffic

1947
01:57:28,192 --> 01:57:29,216
2 AK

1948
01:57:29,728 --> 01:57:30,496
412

1949
01:57:31,008 --> 01:57:31,520
Tire

1950
01:57:31,776 --> 01:57:32,288
School system

1951
01:57:33,056 --> 01:57:33,824
And the word is

1952
01:57:34,336 --> 01:57:35,360
That's cool system

1953
01:57:35,616 --> 01:57:37,152
Was shut down for those years

1954
01:57:37,408 --> 01:57:38,688
Put the record show

1955
01:57:39,200 --> 01:57:39,712
Jealous

1956
01:57:40,480 --> 01:57:41,248
It was open

1957
01:57:42,016 --> 01:57:48,160
So you might have some questions about how that evidence works

1958
01:57:48,416 --> 01:57:49,696
Very confused one question

1959
01:57:49,952 --> 01:57:51,232
So you said in the video

1960
01:57:51,488 --> 01:57:52,768
We see Sandy Hook

1961
01:57:53,024 --> 01:57:53,536
What's the website

1962
01:57:53,792 --> 01:57:54,816
70 traffic

1963
01:57:57,376 --> 01:57:58,144
So

1964
01:57:58,400 --> 01:58:00,192
Internet Wayback machine

1965
01:58:00,704 --> 01:58:02,496
Do you believe that that shows internet traffic

1966
01:58:03,008 --> 01:58:03,520
That what you believe

1967
01:58:06,592 --> 01:58:09,152
What shows is what's the archive

1968
01:58:10,176 --> 01:58:11,456
There's also

1969
01:58:14,784 --> 01:58:16,576
Go back to Jersey

1970
01:58:17,088 --> 01:58:19,904
And that way back machine does not show internet traffic

1971
01:58:23,232 --> 01:58:24,768
Material in traffic

1972
01:58:25,792 --> 01:58:27,584
You were going to stick by you thinking

1973
01:58:28,352 --> 01:58:29,120
You chose traffic

1974
01:58:29,376 --> 01:58:29,888
Internet traffic

1975
01:58:30,400 --> 01:58:31,168
That's what it's measuring

1976
01:58:33,728 --> 01:58:37,824
Traffic in posting

1977
01:58:40,896 --> 01:58:45,760
You ever read the Wayback machine FAQ frequently asked questions or figured out what it is

1978
01:58:46,272 --> 01:58:49,600
That is not with the Wayback machine.

1979
01:58:50,368 --> 01:58:52,160
So you have this like it's

1980
01:58:52,416 --> 01:58:57,536
The Smoking Gun is Alex called it on this 2016 videos that is a coup

1981
01:58:57,792 --> 01:58:58,304
Beat

1982
01:58:58,816 --> 01:59:01,632
Misunderstood misrepresented piece of information

1983
01:59:01,888 --> 01:59:03,168
And what makes it

1984
01:59:03,680 --> 01:59:04,960
More troubling

1985
01:59:05,216 --> 01:59:05,984
Is

1986
01:59:06,496 --> 01:59:08,544
You say there's things showing that there's no traffic coming to the

1987
01:59:09,568 --> 01:59:10,080
What are you talkin about

1988
01:59:11,360 --> 01:59:14,432
I think you could pull it up pretty easily because it comes from Jim Fetzer

1989
01:59:14,688 --> 01:59:18,528
Bookwright you can just open up Jim Fetters book Noah

1990
01:59:19,040 --> 01:59:20,576
What's your phone's going to caution you again

1991
01:59:21,088 --> 01:59:22,624
Answer your question

1992
01:59:22,880 --> 01:59:24,416
You can see it's very frustrating

1993
01:59:25,184 --> 01:59:26,976
Affiliated with any party

1994
01:59:27,488 --> 01:59:29,280
Is a private person pay to provide service

1995
01:59:30,048 --> 01:59:32,096
Come here to try to write all this down

1996
01:59:32,608 --> 01:59:33,888
Let's try to behave in a deposition

1997
01:59:34,656 --> 01:59:35,680
Let me finish my quest

1998
01:59:37,216 --> 01:59:39,520
You didn't check any other Connecticut school district website

1999
01:59:39,776 --> 01:59:41,056
Because they all look like this

2000
01:59:43,872 --> 01:59:44,640
I don't remember

2001
01:59:46,688 --> 01:59:50,784
Well let's say hypothetically if you were gone and you would seem that every other

2002
01:59:51,040 --> 01:59:52,832
School District website looks just like this

2003
01:59:53,344 --> 01:59:56,160
He pretty irresponsible to go on the internet

2004
01:59:56,672 --> 01:59:58,208
Call The Smoking Gun

2005
02:00:03,072 --> 02:00:05,888
I was predominantly talking about the other information that I may go back

2006
02:00:08,704 --> 02:00:09,216
I am

2007
02:00:09,472 --> 02:00:12,032
I'm glad he finally understood what a hypothetical

2008
02:00:17,664 --> 02:00:20,224
Yes you're right that would be wrong

2009
02:00:20,480 --> 02:00:21,760
Did you do that

2010
02:00:22,528 --> 02:00:26,368
Ride hypotheticals are leading to

2011
02:00:27,648 --> 02:00:29,696
Yeah I mean the problem with that is like

2012
02:00:29,952 --> 02:00:36,096
Yes or no you're wrong oh yeah Connecticut school districts have the same pattern on web

2013
02:00:36,352 --> 02:00:36,864
Back machine

2014
02:00:37,120 --> 02:00:41,984
If you did look that up then you're willfully lying if you're not then

2015
02:00:42,240 --> 02:00:44,288
You clearly just took this piece of information

2016
02:00:44,544 --> 02:00:46,336
Presumably from Jim Fetzer

2017
02:00:46,592 --> 02:00:47,872
As Italy's of his book

2018
02:00:48,128 --> 02:00:54,272
And Alex does not want that to be the perception because Jim Fetzer just lost that big lawsuit

2019
02:00:54,528 --> 02:00:55,808
WeatherBug

2020
02:00:57,088 --> 02:00:57,856
Jimmy

2021
02:01:00,416 --> 02:01:02,464
If you put out that book back then

2022
02:01:03,744 --> 02:01:08,096
You know still now he's losing a lawsuit

2023
02:01:08,608 --> 02:01:13,984
It tends to look like Alex could be heading for a similar path I believe Alex is never ready

2024
02:01:15,008 --> 02:01:18,848
I believe I believe that he has been given

2025
02:01:19,104 --> 02:01:22,688
Several quotes from

2026
02:01:23,200 --> 02:01:29,344
Or the same information like let's say he read a Blog that was based on

2027
02:01:29,600 --> 02:01:35,744
That maybe one of his employees

2028
02:01:36,000 --> 02:01:36,512
Give you a cliff notes

2029
02:01:37,024 --> 02:01:42,400
Which is why it's important for the Rob interview to have actually had some substance to it

2030
02:01:42,656 --> 02:01:44,192
Price down what's the process

2031
02:01:45,216 --> 02:01:45,728
Nope

2032
02:01:45,984 --> 02:01:48,032
So in that same clip from 2016

2033
02:01:48,288 --> 02:01:52,384
Video record show that the school was closed

2034
02:01:52,896 --> 02:01:54,176
And you get to ask about that

2035
02:01:54,688 --> 02:01:55,456
Right after that

2036
02:01:55,968 --> 02:01:56,736
Wayback machine

2037
02:01:57,504 --> 02:01:59,808
You said the word is that school shut down for those

2038
02:02:00,576 --> 02:02:01,344
That's what the records

2039
02:02:02,112 --> 02:02:02,880
That was your

2040
02:02:03,136 --> 02:02:03,648
Correct

2041
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:09,024
That's what I'm asking

2042
02:02:09,792 --> 02:02:10,560
Those records

2043
02:02:10,816 --> 02:02:11,328
What are you talkin

2044
02:02:13,632 --> 02:02:14,400
You haven't done that

2045
02:02:15,680 --> 02:02:19,776
You've been under lawsuit now for over a year

2046
02:02:20,544 --> 02:02:21,312
Sandy Hook related

2047
02:02:21,824 --> 02:02:22,592
Multiple cases

2048
02:02:23,104 --> 02:02:24,128
And you haven't done anything

2049
02:02:24,896 --> 02:02:26,688
To go try to find what your sources for these claims

2050
02:02:36,160 --> 02:02:40,512
Is that is that an opinion or a fact uncompelling response

2051
02:02:42,816 --> 02:02:44,096
I did all that

2052
02:02:44,608 --> 02:02:47,424
So Alex like I said you just really doesn't want the

2053
02:02:47,680 --> 02:02:53,056
Perception to be getting his information just from Fetzer at Epic because that looks really bad yeah

2054
02:02:53,312 --> 02:02:55,872
So he keeps claiming that he can produce other evidence

2055
02:02:56,128 --> 02:02:56,640
But then

2056
02:02:56,896 --> 02:02:57,664
Somehow hasn't

2057
02:02:57,920 --> 02:03:00,480
So if I wanted to know when you say the records showed

2058
02:03:05,088 --> 02:03:07,392
I can show what I was talking about that

2059
02:03:08,160 --> 02:03:10,208
There you can produce whatever you were relying on it

2060
02:03:13,792 --> 02:03:14,304
Specified

2061
02:03:17,632 --> 02:03:18,656
Lottery

2062
02:03:19,936 --> 02:03:20,704
Sure

2063
02:03:23,008 --> 02:03:23,520
When you

2064
02:03:24,032 --> 02:03:25,056
You're asked a question

2065
02:03:27,104 --> 02:03:27,872
Produce to me

2066
02:03:28,384 --> 02:03:29,152
Your source

2067
02:03:29,408 --> 02:03:29,920
Or record

2068
02:03:30,688 --> 02:03:31,200
Information

2069
02:03:31,456 --> 02:03:31,968
You relied on

2070
02:03:32,480 --> 02:03:33,504
They say the school was closed

2071
02:03:34,016 --> 02:03:35,040
That's something you could do

2072
02:03:35,552 --> 02:03:36,064
Yes

2073
02:03:37,088 --> 02:03:38,880
I don't know.

2074
02:03:39,648 --> 02:03:40,416
What you looking for

2075
02:03:40,672 --> 02:03:41,952
If you had record

2076
02:03:42,976 --> 02:03:44,000
Information

2077
02:03:45,536 --> 02:03:46,560
Infrasource

2078
02:03:47,840 --> 02:03:52,448
Showing the school in America's most horrifying school shooting with actually closed

2079
02:03:53,216 --> 02:03:53,984
Price save that

2080
02:03:57,056 --> 02:04:01,664
What specifically mention I can bum and I remember what what what they were poking out what was going on

2081
02:04:04,224 --> 02:04:05,504
I'm asking you if you would have saved

2082
02:04:14,720 --> 02:04:15,488
Ernst

2083
02:04:22,144 --> 02:04:23,680
I'm asking you where you at information

2084
02:04:24,448 --> 02:04:27,264
Let the school shooting at is the most famous in American history

2085
02:04:27,776 --> 02:04:30,592
Actually occurred any school that was closed down

2086
02:04:31,104 --> 02:04:32,384
Wasn't operating school

2087
02:04:32,640 --> 02:04:33,920
Did you say

2088
02:04:35,968 --> 02:04:36,992
I don't remember

2089
02:04:38,528 --> 02:04:39,296
7 years ago

2090
02:04:39,552 --> 02:04:40,576
Okay

2091
02:04:41,088 --> 02:04:42,880
Originally run businesses

2092
02:04:44,160 --> 02:04:50,304
And it was a long time ago man I had this game-changing information as ads long time ago

2093
02:04:50,816 --> 02:04:51,328
So

2094
02:04:51,584 --> 02:04:55,680
This narrative is bunk and I think that in this

2095
02:04:55,936 --> 02:05:02,080
Course of this conversation they pretty well laid out like you were full of s*** on this and his only responses

2096
02:05:02,336 --> 02:05:05,920
I guess I could find her information but haven't yet

2097
02:05:06,432 --> 02:05:09,504
So the other one another one is the Anderson Cooper nose thing

2098
02:05:09,760 --> 02:05:13,344
Kind of talked about that on the last deposition so it doesn't come back up

2099
02:05:13,856 --> 02:05:14,624
Another one

2100
02:05:14,880 --> 02:05:18,208
Is Alex has this job narrative about a CNN

2101
02:05:18,464 --> 02:05:19,488
Interview

2102
02:05:19,744 --> 02:05:23,840
That took place and it was two people that were out in a remote location

2103
02:05:24,096 --> 02:05:26,912
And you can see the same car past behind both of us

2104
02:05:27,424 --> 02:05:28,960
Alex is saying that this is

2105
02:05:29,216 --> 02:05:30,240
Meant to be

2106
02:05:30,496 --> 02:05:32,544
Faking the news and it's meant to

2107
02:05:33,056 --> 02:05:39,200
You know it's supposed to be like oh they're pretending they're in different places but you could tell they're in the same place cuz the media is

2108
02:05:39,456 --> 02:05:40,480
Sure

2109
02:05:40,736 --> 02:05:42,784
That has nothing to do with Sandy Hook

2110
02:05:43,296 --> 02:05:45,344
But it had to do with this media liar

2111
02:05:45,600 --> 02:05:51,744
Yeah it was actually people waiting for the Epley that was the jury verdict in the Jodi Arias

2112
02:05:52,000 --> 02:05:52,512
Murder trial

2113
02:05:53,024 --> 02:05:57,888
So Alex is like they're pretending they're in different places but it's clear they're in the same place

2114
02:05:58,144 --> 02:05:59,936
Ergo CNN lies

2115
02:06:00,448 --> 02:06:02,496
Biscuits dismantled so f******

2116
02:06:03,264 --> 02:06:04,800
You remember that bus and going behind them

2117
02:06:06,848 --> 02:06:09,152
The story was there at the same location

2118
02:06:09,664 --> 02:06:11,200
Explain what you think's going on here

2119
02:06:15,808 --> 02:06:16,832
I'm saying just they were staging

2120
02:06:17,088 --> 02:06:17,600
They were

2121
02:06:18,112 --> 02:06:18,880
Different locations

2122
02:06:19,392 --> 02:06:21,440
Where they stating that they were in different locations

2123
02:06:21,952 --> 02:06:23,488
That's what I believe the report was

2124
02:06:24,000 --> 02:06:26,048
DC out the top of the picture here you have

2125
02:06:26,560 --> 02:06:28,096
Little boxes that say where they are

2126
02:06:30,656 --> 02:06:31,680
Are they in different places

2127
02:06:33,216 --> 02:06:34,240
Are they both say Phoenix

2128
02:06:39,616 --> 02:06:41,152
Remote

2129
02:06:42,176 --> 02:06:43,712
Sure but they're only 40 yards away from you

2130
02:06:46,528 --> 02:06:47,808
You don't remember what they're covering here

2131
02:06:54,208 --> 02:06:58,560
He has no awareness of the details of these

2132
02:06:59,072 --> 02:07:00,352
Pieces of his narrative

2133
02:07:01,120 --> 02:07:02,144
It's so

2134
02:07:02,656 --> 02:07:03,168
Tragic

2135
02:07:03,424 --> 02:07:09,568
But it's so obvious

2136
02:07:09,824 --> 02:07:10,848
Panthers he could ever offer

2137
02:07:11,360 --> 02:07:15,968
If if pushed on it like why do you think that they are presenting themselves as being

2138
02:07:16,224 --> 02:07:18,528
In separate places

2139
02:07:18,784 --> 02:07:22,624
They're waiting outside the courthouse one person stationed over here the others over here

2140
02:07:22,880 --> 02:07:24,928
Enter having conversation while they wait for the

2141
02:07:25,184 --> 02:07:26,208
Sure you.

2142
02:07:26,720 --> 02:07:30,304
But that's not suspicious they didn't presented as anything other than that

2143
02:07:30,560 --> 02:07:32,864
You are presenting it as something other than that

2144
02:07:33,632 --> 02:07:35,680
List biscuits today that like

2145
02:07:37,216 --> 02:07:41,056
When people ask is if you would you actually sit down and talk with Alex

2146
02:07:41,312 --> 02:07:45,152
Like this is what you get if you if he thinks he's telling you the truth

2147
02:07:45,664 --> 02:07:49,248
And if he's under oath

2148
02:07:49,504 --> 02:07:50,272
Yeah

2149
02:07:50,528 --> 02:07:51,296
So

2150
02:07:52,320 --> 02:07:54,880
After this point I think you get to the only point

2151
02:07:55,136 --> 02:07:56,672
The interview wear

2152
02:07:56,928 --> 02:07:59,488
I got the lawyer gets a little bit

2153
02:07:59,744 --> 02:08:01,280
Pointing the finger at I

2154
02:08:02,048 --> 02:08:06,144
Are because he starts comparing Alex to Nancy Grace

2155
02:08:06,656 --> 02:08:08,704
Tri-Cities the same thing as her

2156
02:08:09,216 --> 02:08:15,360
You know I don't mind getting a little personal and being like you should visit what you doing

2157
02:08:16,896 --> 02:08:22,784
But that's a statement of fact

2158
02:08:24,064 --> 02:08:25,344
You're basically the same thing

2159
02:08:27,392 --> 02:08:29,184
I don't follow Nancy Grace

2160
02:08:33,792 --> 02:08:35,072
Really really Reckless track

2161
02:08:36,352 --> 02:08:38,912
And you do the same thing with the conspiracy to us don't you

2162
02:08:40,960 --> 02:08:42,752
No I questioned a system known for

2163
02:08:49,152 --> 02:08:51,200
RWBY Raconteurs.

2164
02:08:51,968 --> 02:08:55,296
Obese men in the Benghazi stand Oz we've been lied to so much

2165
02:08:55,552 --> 02:08:57,600
It's like most Americans I'm question

2166
02:08:59,904 --> 02:09:01,184
What question did you ask

2167
02:09:05,792 --> 02:09:07,328
I was talking about some of the question

2168
02:09:08,864 --> 02:09:10,400
I'm not I don't what was the quest

2169
02:09:11,168 --> 02:09:11,680
Question

2170
02:09:13,984 --> 02:09:14,752
I heard a lot of State

2171
02:09:15,008 --> 02:09:16,032
Can you tell me what the question was

2172
02:09:17,312 --> 02:09:19,104
I was putting out some of the

2173
02:09:20,384 --> 02:09:21,408
Reasons people

2174
02:09:22,176 --> 02:09:22,944
You were putting out

2175
02:09:23,712 --> 02:09:24,480
Assertion

2176
02:09:24,736 --> 02:09:25,504
That were false

2177
02:09:26,272 --> 02:09:32,416
I like this approach because it's not getting bogged down in the like what about

2178
02:09:32,672 --> 02:09:38,816
Babies in incubators it's just letting that roll off his back what was the question

2179
02:09:39,840 --> 02:09:43,936
What are you questioning that was perfect because the entire the whole babies

2180
02:09:44,192 --> 02:09:47,520
He's doing his classic laundry list of things hoping that you'll get

2181
02:09:47,776 --> 02:09:52,384
Caught on one and then he can be like

2182
02:09:52,640 --> 02:09:58,784
Yeah and I believe was in the Rob do one that he brings up also the the babies in incubators thing

2183
02:09:59,040 --> 02:10:00,320
And he's like the lawyers

2184
02:10:00,576 --> 02:10:01,088
You know

2185
02:10:01,344 --> 02:10:02,624
In that case

2186
02:10:03,136 --> 02:10:03,648
If

2187
02:10:03,904 --> 02:10:06,976
One of the people in like let's say saddam's Army

2188
02:10:07,488 --> 02:10:09,792
There's a people who are being lied about in that case

2189
02:10:10,048 --> 02:10:13,888
If one of them wanted to sue the media they should be able to write

2190
02:10:19,776 --> 02:10:25,920
These little unexamined of flip itself.

2191
02:10:26,176 --> 02:10:32,320
See how easily they can be and Alex accidentally does that to himself

2192
02:10:32,832 --> 02:10:36,160
Because throughout this entire interview and deposition

2193
02:10:36,416 --> 02:10:38,976
Alex keeps bringing up questioning Epstein's death

2194
02:10:39,488 --> 02:10:44,096
And it leads to at the end of this Alex stepping in a big old Puddle of Mudd

2195
02:10:47,680 --> 02:10:50,240
The dad is going to be his big like

2196
02:10:50,496 --> 02:10:54,336
What you do you say I can't question things but what about

2197
02:10:55,104 --> 02:10:56,896
Much like I robbed you in the

2198
02:10:57,408 --> 02:11:02,016
Do you have babies in incubators it's turns on him very quick yeah this is very clear that

2199
02:11:02,272 --> 02:11:06,112
Alex and Rob do exist in a world where they think they're smarter than every

2200
02:11:06,624 --> 02:11:08,416
And they don't have to prepare

2201
02:11:08,672 --> 02:11:11,488
That none of this is going to be a big deal I can take care of this

2202
02:11:12,000 --> 02:11:13,024
You're absolutely right

2203
02:11:13,280 --> 02:11:19,424
PJ dubs comes out of this looking like looks great I am out of my class here so I'm going to be as honest as I need

2204
02:11:19,680 --> 02:11:24,032
Need to be while still controlling what I can I'm going to get this in get this out

2205
02:11:24,288 --> 02:11:30,432
It's an hour-long deposition the reason I do that is because there are pieces of evidence that he was not in

2206
02:11:30,688 --> 02:11:36,832
With this b******* you can take a little bit of an external like

2207
02:11:37,088 --> 02:11:43,232
Well look man I tried to say don't do this I can't control what goes on it and yes I still

2208
02:11:43,488 --> 02:11:45,280
Still work for them afterwards

2209
02:11:45,536 --> 02:11:49,120
How many independent I did what I could

2210
02:11:49,376 --> 02:11:50,144
Time to work

2211
02:11:50,656 --> 02:11:56,800
He's a shitbag for so many other reasons but this one will take off of his list

2212
02:11:57,056 --> 02:11:59,616
Low priority

2213
02:11:59,872 --> 02:12:00,640
Alex

2214
02:12:00,896 --> 02:12:01,408
Being asked

2215
02:12:01,920 --> 02:12:03,968
About that video that they just played

2216
02:12:04,480 --> 02:12:05,760
About all this stuff

2217
02:12:06,272 --> 02:12:09,856
Or ask any of that true

2218
02:12:10,368 --> 02:12:11,904
Literally every single

2219
02:12:12,160 --> 02:12:13,440
Assertion you made in that video

2220
02:12:14,208 --> 02:12:15,744
Not one thing you said in in

2221
02:12:17,792 --> 02:12:18,560
No

2222
02:12:33,920 --> 02:12:35,200
Nice

2223
02:12:35,712 --> 02:12:36,992
Namely

2224
02:12:38,784 --> 02:12:42,624
One of Alex's other big narrative

2225
02:12:42,880 --> 02:12:44,160
About Sandy Hook is

2226
02:12:44,416 --> 02:12:46,208
Bloomberg sent out

2227
02:12:46,464 --> 02:12:47,488
Email the night before

2228
02:12:48,000 --> 02:12:48,512
To get ready

2229
02:12:48,768 --> 02:12:53,376
Sheriff's up big chair this apparently probably it's not true

2230
02:12:53,632 --> 02:12:59,008
Female that comes up there was an email sent the day before

2231
02:12:59,264 --> 02:12:59,776
Dang

2232
02:13:00,032 --> 02:13:01,824
Get ready next 24 hours are going to be a big

2233
02:13:02,848 --> 02:13:04,640
That email you've been asked for that

2234
02:13:05,152 --> 02:13:05,664
And you say you don't

2235
02:13:06,176 --> 02:13:06,688
Right

2236
02:13:07,200 --> 02:13:12,320
We were we were covering reports of the email that was sent out of activist groups has been on the news

2237
02:13:12,576 --> 02:13:13,600
Where were you covering it

2238
02:13:13,856 --> 02:13:14,624
Women who you cover

2239
02:13:16,928 --> 02:13:18,208
We were covering the report

2240
02:13:19,232 --> 02:13:20,768
Activating Rivera

2241
02:13:22,816 --> 02:13:23,328
Orientation

2242
02:13:23,840 --> 02:13:25,888
Okay well Sears

2243
02:13:26,656 --> 02:13:28,192
I thought there must be some email

2244
02:13:28,960 --> 02:13:29,984
Coincidentally sent

2245
02:13:30,240 --> 02:13:31,008
On the day before Sandy

2246
02:13:31,776 --> 02:13:32,544
Dublin burgers

2247
02:13:32,800 --> 02:13:33,312
People sent

2248
02:13:33,568 --> 02:13:35,616
That you must be wilfully misinterpreting

2249
02:13:37,152 --> 02:13:37,664
Promise

2250
02:13:37,920 --> 02:13:40,224
Nobody would look at this has been able to find any evidence

2251
02:13:42,528 --> 02:13:43,296
And I want to know if you can

2252
02:13:46,624 --> 02:13:49,184
Taking your first investigates

2253
02:13:49,440 --> 02:13:52,000
Well I must that's why I've asked you questions in Discovery

2254
02:13:52,768 --> 02:13:55,072
And you haven't been able to produce

2255
02:13:56,096 --> 02:13:58,400
We have an email in Gmail

2256
02:13:58,912 --> 02:14:00,960
Other news reports

2257
02:14:01,216 --> 02:14:04,800
Could you find those reports if you needed to

2258
02:14:05,056 --> 02:14:06,336
Could you identify your source

2259
02:14:09,408 --> 02:14:09,920
See what you doing

2260
02:14:16,064 --> 02:14:17,856
What do you mean you can hold back a source of fuel

2261
02:14:18,112 --> 02:14:19,136
What does that mean

2262
02:14:20,928 --> 02:14:22,464
Force

2263
02:14:22,720 --> 02:14:23,488
April 4th premiere

2264
02:14:24,000 --> 02:14:26,304
Text about that's how I remember

2265
02:14:26,816 --> 02:14:28,352
News reported on

2266
02:14:32,192 --> 02:14:32,960
Why haven't you

2267
02:14:33,216 --> 02:14:33,984
I just can't

2268
02:14:34,240 --> 02:14:36,800
The great thing there is that that's

2269
02:14:37,056 --> 02:14:43,200
Greeley water I think that's the only time it really comes up with the idea of holding back information holding back to source

2270
02:14:43,456 --> 02:14:46,784
And Alex is doing it specifically to say that's not the case

2271
02:14:47,296 --> 02:14:50,880
It's the only time with that trigger it looks like it's going to be pulled

2272
02:14:51,904 --> 02:14:53,184
Iiii

2273
02:14:53,696 --> 02:14:54,464
I'm Amazed

2274
02:14:54,976 --> 02:14:57,792
The clear message that you get is just like

2275
02:14:58,048 --> 02:14:58,816
Okay can you

2276
02:14:59,840 --> 02:15:01,632
Why haven't you produce this

2277
02:15:01,888 --> 02:15:03,680
Well

2278
02:15:03,936 --> 02:15:09,568
I can't prove all my claims but I can't I have to watch that video again

2279
02:15:09,824 --> 02:15:12,384
Everything I've asked you to produce in Discovery

2280
02:15:12,640 --> 02:15:16,480
You just sent me a treasure Trove of emails that you didn't even read

2281
02:15:16,992 --> 02:15:23,136
And then you didn't even bother to look into other s*** that I asked you for $94 bill

2282
02:15:23,392 --> 02:15:26,976
Bounty

2283
02:15:27,232 --> 02:15:28,512
Got censored and then

2284
02:15:30,048 --> 02:15:36,192
Man so Alex's asked if he is ashamed of his Robbie Parker impression here we go

2285
02:15:36,448 --> 02:15:37,728
Does bit about Robbie Parker

2286
02:15:38,240 --> 02:15:39,264
The whole

2287
02:15:39,520 --> 02:15:44,128
Fake crying B

2288
02:15:45,408 --> 02:15:47,968
Or are you

2289
02:15:48,224 --> 02:15:49,760
Totally fine with seeing video yourself

2290
02:15:51,296 --> 02:15:52,576
You did

2291
02:15:53,344 --> 02:15:56,672
That is an interesting response I

2292
02:15:56,928 --> 02:16:01,792
Instinct is to protect his abilities as an impressionist

2293
02:16:02,048 --> 02:16:02,816
Pensively

2294
02:16:06,144 --> 02:16:12,288
Well well well you're doing a shity me come on now that's weird

2295
02:16:12,544 --> 02:16:15,360
Quality

2296
02:16:16,128 --> 02:16:17,152
Wow so

2297
02:16:17,408 --> 02:16:18,688
Spice dancers

2298
02:16:20,992 --> 02:16:27,136
Play a video of Alex and Rob do talking about all of these anomalies in

2299
02:16:27,392 --> 02:16:30,976
Sandy Hook case they're saying these things always if they're like

2300
02:16:31,232 --> 02:16:34,816
Definitely like well the school wasn't open your all up yet

2301
02:16:35,072 --> 02:16:37,376
Do you think not as asserting that mess facts

2302
02:16:37,632 --> 02:16:38,400
Or statement

2303
02:16:40,704 --> 02:16:42,752
And so when they come back from

2304
02:16:43,264 --> 02:16:45,568
Again the question comes up of

2305
02:16:46,080 --> 02:16:48,640
Do you know the difference between an opinion and a fact

2306
02:16:49,408 --> 02:16:51,456
I want to ask you about the things that you and mr. do

2307
02:16:51,712 --> 02:16:52,224
He said in that video

2308
02:16:52,736 --> 02:16:53,504
We can agree

2309
02:16:53,760 --> 02:16:56,320
There was a list of factual claim

2310
02:16:56,832 --> 02:16:57,344
Correct

2311
02:16:59,136 --> 02:17:00,416
No I was giving my opinion

2312
02:17:00,672 --> 02:17:03,488
When you say porta potties were delivered an hour after it happened

2313
02:17:06,048 --> 02:17:07,584
They were delivered center after

2314
02:17:07,840 --> 02:17:08,864
That's not what I'm asking

2315
02:17:09,632 --> 02:17:10,912
Resting is that a factual

2316
02:17:13,216 --> 02:17:14,240
It's not

2317
02:17:14,496 --> 02:17:15,776
It's not an opinion

2318
02:17:16,800 --> 02:17:17,824
That is an assertion

2319
02:17:19,360 --> 02:17:20,896
So you call it

2320
02:17:22,688 --> 02:17:28,832
Alex keeps trying to use this excuse the reason why I had a little bit of a sort of fumbly around

2321
02:17:29,856 --> 02:17:32,160
Answer to your like you saying these a statement

2322
02:17:32,416 --> 02:17:34,464
The fact is because Alex's defense is

2323
02:17:34,720 --> 02:17:38,816
I was just explaining why people were suspicious about Sandy

2324
02:17:39,072 --> 02:17:44,192
Write to that's his way of getting around like these are things that I'm saying is a

2325
02:17:44,448 --> 02:17:47,264
I'm just explaining why people were suspicious

2326
02:17:47,776 --> 02:17:49,824
But if you really break that down

2327
02:17:50,080 --> 02:17:52,640
The way you would do that responsibly is say

2328
02:17:52,896 --> 02:17:54,432
Here's something that's not true

2329
02:17:54,688 --> 02:18:00,832
This is why people were suspicious about their is Ally going around that much a porta potties Wordle

2330
02:18:01,088 --> 02:18:06,976
Liberty instead he's listing off all of these assertions effectual things and being like

2331
02:18:07,232 --> 02:18:09,024
That's why people had suspicions

2332
02:18:10,048 --> 02:18:11,584
The way that's presented

2333
02:18:12,096 --> 02:18:13,632
Retains the truth

2334
02:18:14,144 --> 02:18:16,448
Of these statements that he's making

2335
02:18:16,704 --> 02:18:19,008
Or the presentation of Truth

2336
02:18:19,264 --> 02:18:20,288
Beats Pill

2337
02:18:20,544 --> 02:18:24,384
Even though he's saying like this is why people were suspicious XYZ

2338
02:18:24,640 --> 02:18:25,920
That's still

2339
02:18:26,432 --> 02:18:28,992
At least in some fashion

2340
02:18:30,016 --> 02:18:31,808
Presenting x y and z

2341
02:18:32,064 --> 02:18:34,624
Here's why it's wet outside of my apartment

2342
02:18:34,880 --> 02:18:38,976
Somebody let go of somebody open the fire hydrant that is a statement of fact

2343
02:18:39,232 --> 02:18:44,608
That's not why people think it's wet or that's not why people are concerned that it's wet it's just

2344
02:18:44,864 --> 02:18:51,008
What is right if you're doing this as a like this is why people believe this step and your

2345
02:18:51,264 --> 02:18:52,288
You're doing it responsibly

2346
02:18:52,544 --> 02:18:57,408
And not in a way that is to lend Credence and credibility to the thing

2347
02:18:57,920 --> 02:18:59,456
You doing at the Pumpkin Show

2348
02:18:59,712 --> 02:19:01,760
And Alex is not doing that he's decidedly

2349
02:19:02,272 --> 02:19:06,880
So he tries to explain that is just so thin

2350
02:19:07,392 --> 02:19:09,696
Started the video talking about the wrong name being given

2351
02:19:14,048 --> 02:19:15,840
Tillandsia had his older brother's ID on him

2352
02:19:16,608 --> 02:19:17,632
Why does that support

2353
02:19:17,888 --> 02:19:18,656
Conspiracy

2354
02:19:19,680 --> 02:19:20,192
Why is that weird

2355
02:19:21,472 --> 02:19:24,288
I think the problem 21 people are questions with a lot of

2356
02:19:26,592 --> 02:19:27,616
Why why does that make you cry

2357
02:19:29,152 --> 02:19:30,944
That Adam Lanza had his brother's ID on

2358
02:19:31,200 --> 02:19:32,224
That was robbed

2359
02:19:32,736 --> 02:19:34,016
Okay why is why is that

2360
02:19:34,272 --> 02:19:36,320
Listener green with it right why are y'all question

2361
02:19:37,856 --> 02:19:39,904
We were pointing out why people question

2362
02:19:40,160 --> 02:19:40,928
Okay when they said

2363
02:19:41,184 --> 02:19:44,256
Rob said they're pulling guns out of cars Lanza had a shotgun

2364
02:19:44,512 --> 02:19:45,024
In his trunk

2365
02:19:45,280 --> 02:19:46,048
Why is that support

2366
02:19:46,560 --> 02:19:47,584
Question about whether sand

2367
02:19:49,376 --> 02:19:52,704
Memory services

2368
02:19:54,752 --> 02:19:56,800
That was at inside of it was inside the Bushmaster

2369
02:19:57,312 --> 02:19:58,848
And you understand your AR-15

2370
02:20:02,688 --> 02:20:04,480
Actually this wasn't 7 years ago

2371
02:20:04,736 --> 02:20:06,272
This is April 27th

2372
02:20:06,528 --> 02:20:08,064
I know I'm just saying going back

2373
02:20:10,624 --> 02:20:11,904
That's so weak

2374
02:20:12,672 --> 02:20:14,976
Such a weak defense for this

2375
02:20:15,744 --> 02:20:16,256
So

2376
02:20:16,512 --> 02:20:21,120
The thing is it Alex like I said I keep coming back to this cuz I think the sense that I get

2377
02:20:21,632 --> 02:20:24,192
Is that Alex is really trying to protect

2378
02:20:24,704 --> 02:20:30,848
From the perception being Vicky's just repeating stuff from Fetzer

2379
02:20:31,104 --> 02:20:37,248
Individual sources that we research yeah I am repeating whatever anybody

2380
02:20:37,760 --> 02:20:39,296
I think that that is really important

2381
02:20:40,064 --> 02:20:42,368
And I think that's what he's doing

2382
02:20:42,880 --> 02:20:46,208
Send you a kids going around in circles with their hands up around the school

2383
02:20:46,720 --> 02:20:47,488
That is false

2384
02:20:47,744 --> 02:20:49,024
The truth

2385
02:20:49,536 --> 02:20:51,072
I have to review it again

2386
02:20:56,192 --> 02:20:57,984
All these things you were saying as fact

2387
02:20:59,008 --> 02:21:00,800
You were saying them just a couple months before you were

2388
02:21:08,736 --> 02:21:12,064
All these things

2389
02:21:14,368 --> 02:21:17,184
I don't know about that sir but it came from people question

2390
02:21:18,976 --> 02:21:25,120
It's important to him somehow to disassociate himself particularly from Fetzer and I think it's good

2391
02:21:25,376 --> 02:21:25,888
Cuz he lost a lawsuit

2392
02:21:27,424 --> 02:21:32,288
Not because he's a rabid anti-semite I don't know about gravity

2393
02:21:33,312 --> 02:21:33,824
So

2394
02:21:36,640 --> 02:21:37,408
Disclaim

2395
02:21:37,664 --> 02:21:38,944
That's a Dubai porta potty

2396
02:21:39,456 --> 02:21:42,272
Alex's wishy-washy

2397
02:21:42,784 --> 02:21:44,064
The next one that says

2398
02:21:44,576 --> 02:21:47,136
Why were porta potties sandwiches fruit

2399
02:21:47,392 --> 02:21:47,904
Drinks

2400
02:21:48,160 --> 02:21:48,928
And chips Broughton

2401
02:21:49,184 --> 02:21:50,976
Set up for people at the crime scene

2402
02:21:51,744 --> 02:21:52,512
Inside the

2403
02:21:52,768 --> 02:21:53,280
School

2404
02:21:57,120 --> 02:21:58,656
We'll take a wild guess right now weather.

2405
02:22:06,080 --> 02:22:07,104
You think people ate

2406
02:22:07,360 --> 02:22:09,408
Food inside the school at the crime

2407
02:22:10,432 --> 02:22:13,248
That's what you think

2408
02:22:17,600 --> 02:22:20,160
So that's another thing that

2409
02:22:20,416 --> 02:22:21,184
Put on your show without you

2410
02:22:21,696 --> 02:22:23,744
You're saying is from holiday

2411
02:22:24,256 --> 02:22:25,280
I thought you just agreed it was

2412
02:22:28,608 --> 02:22:29,632
Okay okay

2413
02:22:30,400 --> 02:22:33,728
You just said earlier probably got there

2414
02:22:33,984 --> 02:22:35,776
Great is if they win

2415
02:22:36,288 --> 02:22:39,104
This can't if they don't get taken down by this case

2416
02:22:39,360 --> 02:22:44,480
It's going to have to be on some b******* technicality thing where the judges like

2417
02:22:44,736 --> 02:22:50,880
Clearly you did all of the wrong things that is it but according to the law of this is

2418
02:22:51,136 --> 02:22:53,440
It's on a Tuesday and you said two bouquet

2419
02:22:53,952 --> 02:22:56,768
Like that's the only way

2420
02:22:57,024 --> 02:23:03,168
Sovereign citizen miracle

2421
02:23:03,424 --> 02:23:09,312
So we can sit in his chair and be like I'm proposing you what are you doing

2422
02:23:09,568 --> 02:23:11,104
So Alex also

2423
02:23:11,360 --> 02:23:17,504
Wants to fall back into this place where there's a lot of questions cuz there was a ton of secrecy

2424
02:23:17,760 --> 02:23:18,528
The around the case

2425
02:23:18,784 --> 02:23:20,320
I didn't even put out a report

2426
02:23:20,576 --> 02:23:23,136
Tell her whatever you know like

2427
02:23:23,392 --> 02:23:29,536
How I supposed to know there's no official information out although I would just not believe the official information

2428
02:23:29,792 --> 02:23:31,840
Alex

2429
02:23:32,352 --> 02:23:35,424
Can you take a wild guess as to whether or not that's true

2430
02:23:35,936 --> 02:23:39,520
The part about why didn't they let paramedics and EMTs into the building after

2431
02:23:39,776 --> 02:23:41,568
27 children were declared dead

2432
02:23:48,736 --> 02:23:50,016
I remember being reported

2433
02:23:52,576 --> 02:23:53,856
Can you force true or not

2434
02:23:57,440 --> 02:23:58,976
You didn't March right you read

2435
02:23:59,232 --> 02:24:01,536
Two different EMTs who went into the building

2436
02:24:02,048 --> 02:24:03,328
Perform services in the building

2437
02:24:03,840 --> 02:24:05,120
You read those reports correct

2438
02:24:12,800 --> 02:24:15,616
What country was the level sacred seed

2439
02:24:15,872 --> 02:24:19,712
Domino's Pacific for years and years

2440
02:24:20,224 --> 02:24:22,272
Official crime report

2441
02:24:22,784 --> 02:24:24,320
Very long not years and years

2442
02:24:24,576 --> 02:24:27,648
About to go back online

2443
02:24:27,904 --> 02:24:28,416
Crush wine

2444
02:24:31,232 --> 02:24:32,512
Carlos unpack all of that

2445
02:24:33,024 --> 02:24:34,816
Because first of all

2446
02:24:35,072 --> 02:24:36,352
When you read those reports

2447
02:24:36,608 --> 02:24:37,376
In your deposition

2448
02:24:38,656 --> 02:24:39,680
You acknowledge that

2449
02:24:39,936 --> 02:24:40,448
Paramedics

2450
02:24:40,704 --> 02:24:41,984
Building correct

2451
02:24:43,264 --> 02:24:44,544
You showed me documents

2452
02:24:47,872 --> 02:24:49,408
Recently come out when do you think

2453
02:24:52,480 --> 02:24:53,760
I just know there was a big

2454
02:24:54,016 --> 02:24:55,808
Controversy about

2455
02:24:56,576 --> 02:24:58,880
Cover in your testimony

2456
02:25:06,048 --> 02:25:08,096
Those documents were out in 2013

2457
02:25:08,608 --> 02:25:10,144
And here you are in 2017

2458
02:25:10,912 --> 02:25:12,960
Talking about there being no paramedics in the building

2459
02:25:13,472 --> 02:25:14,496
Pretty bad errorism

2460
02:25:32,160 --> 02:25:34,208
Absolutely

2461
02:25:34,464 --> 02:25:35,744
People need to get fired

2462
02:25:36,000 --> 02:25:38,304
Instantly deflated

2463
02:25:38,816 --> 02:25:39,840
That like

2464
02:25:40,096 --> 02:25:46,240
You see that super long pause and what about Yaya

2465
02:25:47,264 --> 02:25:53,152
No I thought you were a globalist and you're trying to defend all the globalist stuff

2466
02:25:53,408 --> 02:25:55,712
That is something that does come up to is the like

2467
02:25:56,992 --> 02:25:58,016
You and the estate

2468
02:25:59,808 --> 02:26:05,952
You think of it I wouldn't sue the mainstream media if I had the opportunity to do think I wouldn't take that case jacks

2469
02:26:06,208 --> 02:26:09,280
I think I am the establishment I am not

2470
02:26:11,584 --> 02:26:15,168
It said it said it said it is queer

2471
02:26:15,424 --> 02:26:18,496
That Alex is still even in this case under oath

2472
02:26:18,752 --> 02:26:20,800
And the here in this deposition

2473
02:26:21,056 --> 02:26:23,872
It's clear that he's still kind of at least

2474
02:26:24,384 --> 02:26:26,688
Somewhat thinks that this is part of a

2475
02:26:26,944 --> 02:26:29,760
Conspiracy yeah absolutely it's very it's very tragic

2476
02:26:30,272 --> 02:26:33,856
I'm just trying to figure out exactly how many other offenses

2477
02:26:34,112 --> 02:26:35,136
Since he's committed in this

2478
02:26:35,392 --> 02:26:38,976
Deposition like the hum

2479
02:26:39,232 --> 02:26:41,280
Like there's no way that you can

2480
02:26:41,536 --> 02:26:42,048
I don't know

2481
02:26:42,304 --> 02:26:43,840
I can't

2482
02:26:44,096 --> 02:26:46,400
I don't know enough internal details

2483
02:26:46,656 --> 02:26:47,936
But it doesn't look good

2484
02:26:48,960 --> 02:26:49,984
So

2485
02:26:50,240 --> 02:26:52,544
Earlier we talked about Paul's deposition

2486
02:26:52,800 --> 02:26:56,384
And in it Paul said that he wrote that email back

2487
02:26:56,640 --> 02:26:58,176
To Lenny Posner himself

2488
02:26:58,944 --> 02:27:01,248
Now because Paul said that

2489
02:27:02,016 --> 02:27:07,904
There's plausible deniability for Alex to pretend that he didn't know the family members were being harassed

2490
02:27:08,160 --> 02:27:10,208
As early as 2013

2491
02:27:10,720 --> 02:27:12,256
Alex completely blows the Alex

2492
02:27:12,512 --> 02:27:18,656
We got a clear path to the end zone for you just run that ball right on in there ever call 11

2493
02:27:18,912 --> 02:27:24,288
Different remember it's a clear path to the end zone but it helps him and he destroys that

2494
02:27:24,544 --> 02:27:27,616
And then you and mr. Watson together composer

2495
02:27:28,128 --> 02:27:28,640
Correct

2496
02:27:31,712 --> 02:27:33,760
You don't remember saying that you and Mister

2497
02:27:34,272 --> 02:27:35,552
Watson where did this together

2498
02:27:47,072 --> 02:27:47,584
So

2499
02:27:47,840 --> 02:27:49,632
Is the older there's differing

2500
02:27:50,144 --> 02:27:53,216
Slightly different takes on who wrote the email

2501
02:27:53,472 --> 02:27:58,336
Dr. Oz clear that he had a conversation with Paul about it and

2502
02:27:58,592 --> 02:28:01,152
Wanted to invite Posner on the show

2503
02:28:01,408 --> 02:28:02,176
Indicates

2504
02:28:02,432 --> 02:28:04,736
That he was clearly aware of all of that

2505
02:28:06,016 --> 02:28:06,528
Yeah

2506
02:28:07,040 --> 02:28:09,600
So in that email question

2507
02:28:09,856 --> 02:28:12,672
Do you think he knows the difference between

2508
02:28:13,184 --> 02:28:13,952
A criminal trial is

2509
02:28:16,000 --> 02:28:19,840
Not the finer points really does feel like he's trying to

2510
02:28:20,096 --> 02:28:20,864
Call display

2511
02:28:21,888 --> 02:28:22,912
I don't know

2512
02:28:23,168 --> 02:28:23,936
I don't recall

2513
02:28:24,192 --> 02:28:30,336
I don't know see you guys can't get me on it you can't force me to testify against my selfie I don't know if

2514
02:28:30,592 --> 02:28:32,896
Appearance of playing dumb

2515
02:28:33,408 --> 02:28:35,456
And I think that's some of that is

2516
02:28:35,712 --> 02:28:36,224
Is

2517
02:28:37,504 --> 02:28:39,296
Is just

2518
02:28:40,576 --> 02:28:41,856
Maybe you believe that

2519
02:28:42,624 --> 02:28:44,672
Call Marin they can't prove

2520
02:28:45,440 --> 02:28:50,304
Exactly how we arrived at the conclusions we arrived

2521
02:28:50,560 --> 02:28:51,328
So

2522
02:28:51,840 --> 02:28:57,984
Let's just keep that vague even if we lose we'll lose a ton of money but will be able to keep on with the

2523
02:28:58,240 --> 02:29:00,544
Or or something

2524
02:29:01,056 --> 02:29:01,568
More just

2525
02:29:01,824 --> 02:29:02,336
Defensiveness

2526
02:29:02,592 --> 02:29:03,872
Anything else

2527
02:29:04,128 --> 02:29:05,408
Almost instinctive reflex

2528
02:29:05,664 --> 02:29:11,808
If you're someone like Alex you never want to give up your sources because it will only reveal

2529
02:29:12,064 --> 02:29:13,344
But you have no idea what you're talkin about

2530
02:29:13,600 --> 02:29:14,880
I think that's

2531
02:29:15,136 --> 02:29:17,184
When does the Dominus in real life

2532
02:29:17,440 --> 02:29:23,584
I could find that I've been busy I don't know any of that I think it's because on some level Alex

2533
02:29:23,840 --> 02:29:25,376
Knows you dig too deep

2534
02:29:25,632 --> 02:29:28,448
Into whatever his sourcing was for any of this

2535
02:29:28,704 --> 02:29:31,008
You're going to find Fetzer you're going to find how big

2536
02:29:31,520 --> 02:29:33,312
And it's just not going to look good

2537
02:29:33,824 --> 02:29:37,408
It's going to demonstrate that he never did any kind of works

2538
02:29:37,664 --> 02:29:38,944
Corroborate anything

2539
02:29:39,200 --> 02:29:43,552
It's just going to it's going to look real bad like his disciplinary

2540
02:29:43,808 --> 02:29:47,648
Anything Goes

2541
02:29:47,904 --> 02:29:49,696
Outback Steakhouse over there

2542
02:29:50,720 --> 02:29:53,024
So in the email DePaul Center

2543
02:29:53,280 --> 02:29:54,560
He was saying we do not

2544
02:29:54,816 --> 02:29:57,632
Encourage and condone the actor

2545
02:29:57,888 --> 02:30:00,704
We are just leave distanced ourselves from that

2546
02:30:00,960 --> 02:30:07,104
So they ask Alex about that this is a yes or no answer

2547
02:30:07,360 --> 02:30:09,664
This pathway is blocked

2548
02:30:10,176 --> 02:30:11,968
Mr. Watson rights boxer

2549
02:30:12,224 --> 02:30:13,504
We have not promoted.

2550
02:30:13,760 --> 02:30:14,272
Quote unquote

2551
02:30:14,528 --> 02:30:15,040
Actors

2552
02:30:16,832 --> 02:30:18,112
In fact we have actively

2553
02:30:18,624 --> 02:30:19,136
Who's ourselves

2554
02:30:20,928 --> 02:30:22,464
Over the next six years.

2555
02:30:24,000 --> 02:30:24,768
You didn't you didn't

2556
02:30:25,280 --> 02:30:27,328
Yourself from the actors thing you actively embraced

2557
02:30:34,496 --> 02:30:36,544
Brought it up

2558
02:30:37,312 --> 02:30:38,592
You produced a video to me

2559
02:30:39,360 --> 02:30:40,128
Entitled

2560
02:30:40,640 --> 02:30:43,200
Crisis actors used at Sandy Hook

2561
02:30:43,712 --> 02:30:44,992
And has an!

2562
02:30:45,248 --> 02:30:45,760
Not a?

2563
02:30:47,040 --> 02:30:49,856
What's up video you admit to me you endorse

2564
02:30:50,112 --> 02:30:51,648
Videos

2565
02:30:52,672 --> 02:30:57,792
We gave you work work work work videos that that we were in

2566
02:30:58,304 --> 02:31:01,120
Infowars produced the video and uploaded it to YouTube

2567
02:31:02,400 --> 02:31:04,704
And it was titled crisis actors used at Sandy Hook

2568
02:31:05,216 --> 02:31:08,032
Contradict

2569
02:31:09,056 --> 02:31:10,336
Yes I mean I need to see that

2570
02:31:12,640 --> 02:31:16,736
Do you have why did you say yes there is no idea because

2571
02:31:17,248 --> 02:31:21,856
If they're asking the question with the specific of an! Set-up?

2572
02:31:22,112 --> 02:31:23,648
You got it know that they have that

2573
02:31:24,160 --> 02:31:30,304
You got to know if they have evidence it's on the list they already told you that they have

2574
02:31:30,560 --> 02:31:34,144
You just admitted.

2575
02:31:34,400 --> 02:31:35,424
How's it going with

2576
02:31:35,680 --> 02:31:36,960
That was a typo

2577
02:31:37,216 --> 02:31:43,360
Fake a heart attack do something to get out of there

2578
02:31:44,384 --> 02:31:48,992
What is an interesting question could he have just been like

2579
02:31:49,248 --> 02:31:55,392
Can we stop real quick he doesn't deserve a break just because like I don't think it's because

2580
02:31:55,648 --> 02:31:56,416
Of a question

2581
02:31:56,672 --> 02:31:58,464
Is bad yeah but I think

2582
02:31:58,976 --> 02:32:00,768
He could have called for a break

2583
02:32:01,024 --> 02:32:03,584
Yeah Oregon can they reschedule

2584
02:32:04,096 --> 02:32:05,120
Maybe I mean

2585
02:32:06,400 --> 02:32:07,680
Baby they have been

2586
02:32:10,240 --> 02:32:12,288
We don't know how many times

2587
02:32:13,312 --> 02:32:14,848
I've been put off or not

2588
02:32:15,104 --> 02:32:21,248
I don't know I feel like there's a reason why you would proceed with the Rob do deposition in spite of him being completely under

2589
02:32:21,504 --> 02:32:23,296
That's fair

2590
02:32:23,552 --> 02:32:25,344
The normal thing to do would be like

2591
02:32:25,600 --> 02:32:28,160
Do the work you need to do and come back in a week

2592
02:32:28,416 --> 02:32:30,208
But I don't know I have no idea how these

2593
02:32:30,464 --> 02:32:36,608
That's the only thing that I mean if I was in there and I got two of those hypothetical questions and I got a ride

2594
02:32:37,888 --> 02:32:44,032
Hey we're going to break for the next two to three weeks while I actually read up on all the s*** you're asking me because I'm

2595
02:32:44,288 --> 02:32:45,056
I'm going to lose this time

2596
02:32:46,336 --> 02:32:47,360
Not looking good

2597
02:32:47,872 --> 02:32:48,640
It gets worse

2598
02:32:48,896 --> 02:32:51,712
Because as we talked about earlier

2599
02:32:51,968 --> 02:32:52,736
Posted

2600
02:32:54,016 --> 02:32:56,320
Address of the mailbox

2601
02:32:56,576 --> 02:32:57,088
You're right

2602
02:32:57,344 --> 02:32:58,368
And

2603
02:32:58,624 --> 02:32:59,136
Bad

2604
02:32:59,648 --> 02:33:01,184
My opinion is

2605
02:33:01,696 --> 02:33:02,208
And

2606
02:33:02,720 --> 02:33:06,816
What makes it worse is providing surrounding context to it

2607
02:33:07,584 --> 02:33:08,864
Which state do

2608
02:33:09,376 --> 02:33:10,912
It does appear that Alex

2609
02:33:11,168 --> 02:33:11,936
Was mad

2610
02:33:12,448 --> 02:33:13,728
Epistra Posner

2611
02:33:13,984 --> 02:33:18,336
YouTube strikes on unarmed people who were using pictures

2612
02:33:18,592 --> 02:33:19,872
About their dead children

2613
02:33:20,128 --> 02:33:20,896
You didn't like

2614
02:33:21,152 --> 02:33:21,920
The foundation

2615
02:33:22,176 --> 02:33:23,200
Poster with running

2616
02:33:31,136 --> 02:33:32,672
Voice didn't remember that

2617
02:33:38,560 --> 02:33:43,424
I remember those guys with some of my thing I said nobody.

2618
02:33:45,728 --> 02:33:46,752
Parkland Florida

2619
02:33:47,008 --> 02:33:49,056
Just say no one died again

2620
02:33:52,896 --> 02:33:54,944
YouTube

2621
02:33:55,200 --> 02:33:56,480
Cuz I didn't say nobody.

2622
02:33:57,504 --> 02:33:58,528
Said to send her parents

2623
02:33:58,784 --> 02:33:59,808
Stirring up a hornet's nest

2624
02:34:00,320 --> 02:34:01,344
Right by coming after you

2625
02:34:02,624 --> 02:34:04,416
Cars for sale

2626
02:34:06,720 --> 02:34:08,512
You told the Sandy Hook parents you're not a goddamn mess with

2627
02:34:13,376 --> 02:34:16,192
On your show you showed mapson addresses used by a parent

2628
02:34:16,448 --> 02:34:17,216
You can play

2629
02:34:17,984 --> 02:34:19,008
Cousin your mind

2630
02:34:19,520 --> 02:34:20,800
He was running an anti-freeze

2631
02:34:21,056 --> 02:34:21,568
Translation

2632
02:34:23,616 --> 02:34:24,640
I did not show

2633
02:34:26,688 --> 02:34:27,712
What do you mean you didn't show it

2634
02:34:28,224 --> 02:34:30,016
Aren't you running forward

2635
02:34:31,296 --> 02:34:33,344
U-Haul in parking lot

2636
02:34:35,904 --> 02:34:38,208
Music.

2637
02:34:38,720 --> 02:34:39,744
A public figure

2638
02:34:40,768 --> 02:34:44,352
You said that I remembered once trying to find it and

2639
02:34:44,608 --> 02:34:45,632
This is a shame

2640
02:34:46,144 --> 02:34:47,936
Parking lot

2641
02:34:52,288 --> 02:34:55,616
Post office box

2642
02:34:58,176 --> 02:35:00,992
Certainly never said that but I thought they were saying

2643
02:35:01,504 --> 02:35:04,320
All their houses ever done that ever said

2644
02:35:04,576 --> 02:35:05,856
Harassing myself

2645
02:35:12,256 --> 02:35:13,280
You showed mapson address

2646
02:35:13,536 --> 02:35:14,304
Refuse my parents

2647
02:35:15,840 --> 02:35:16,608
That's what you did

2648
02:35:21,984 --> 02:35:25,312
You showed mapson addresses used by scanning

2649
02:35:25,568 --> 02:35:26,336
Apparently

2650
02:35:27,104 --> 02:35:27,872
That happened

2651
02:35:31,968 --> 02:35:33,760
We we show

2652
02:35:34,016 --> 02:35:35,040
Where is foundation

2653
02:35:36,832 --> 02:35:37,344
Shepherd

2654
02:35:37,600 --> 02:35:38,368
We're saying it was fake

2655
02:35:41,184 --> 02:35:43,744
That argument is so thin

2656
02:35:44,000 --> 02:35:46,816
The idea that he had people who were saying

2657
02:35:47,072 --> 02:35:48,608
This is a fake Foundation

2658
02:35:48,864 --> 02:35:51,680
And he put up the address of it and show the Google Map

2659
02:35:51,936 --> 02:35:53,216
To the location of it

2660
02:35:53,472 --> 02:35:55,264
As a way of De bunking

2661
02:35:55,520 --> 02:35:58,336
This was a fake Foundation is Ludacris

2662
02:35:59,104 --> 02:36:00,640
This is a this is a

2663
02:36:00,896 --> 02:36:01,408
Conversation

2664
02:36:01,664 --> 02:36:03,200
With an eight-year-old who stole a cookie

2665
02:36:04,224 --> 02:36:05,504
Every single like

2666
02:36:05,760 --> 02:36:08,576
Ultra I'll throw out anything to avoid saying yes

2667
02:36:08,832 --> 02:36:11,136
What's so crazy about it

2668
02:36:12,672 --> 02:36:13,184
Weird

2669
02:36:13,440 --> 02:36:15,232
In my mind is that

2670
02:36:16,000 --> 02:36:18,816
Alex is presenting this thing that is not

2671
02:36:19,072 --> 02:36:23,936
A bad thing it was actually trying to help mr. Posner but also he did do it

2672
02:36:24,192 --> 02:36:26,496
Unless you convince him he did do it

2673
02:36:26,752 --> 02:36:28,032
Sure play me the video

2674
02:36:28,288 --> 02:36:34,432
I didn't do that before that I was saying or stirring up a hornet's nest no not someone to mess with

2675
02:36:34,688 --> 02:36:35,712
Who's cry

2676
02:36:35,968 --> 02:36:36,480
Find to help

2677
02:36:36,736 --> 02:36:40,576
That's why I'm not somebody to mess with I'm so helpful

2678
02:36:40,832 --> 02:36:46,976
Don't mess with me I'm trying to help you find this hard to swallow

2679
02:36:47,232 --> 02:36:49,536
So now the topic comes up of when was the

2680
02:36:49,792 --> 02:36:54,656
Fire

2681
02:36:54,912 --> 02:36:55,936
Alex plays.

2682
02:36:56,448 --> 02:36:57,728
Or the truth of the matter is

2683
02:37:02,336 --> 02:37:05,664
One thing about it I do need to spend time in Berlin this Morris

2684
02:37:05,920 --> 02:37:06,688
Sisseton Sisseton

2685
02:37:06,944 --> 02:37:08,992
Cuz it's like I remember a lot of it

2686
02:37:10,528 --> 02:37:12,320
I think if I go dig even deeper I can

2687
02:37:16,672 --> 02:37:18,464
You know that your second deposition

2688
02:37:18,976 --> 02:37:19,744
In the Sandy Hook

2689
02:37:20,512 --> 02:37:22,560
You got more going up in Connecticut

2690
02:37:23,072 --> 02:37:24,352
You got Discovery in Connecticut

2691
02:37:24,864 --> 02:37:26,656
Even Discovery 3 times

2692
02:37:26,912 --> 02:37:27,424
In Texas

2693
02:37:27,936 --> 02:37:31,264
And you're telling me you think you need to go borrow in and figure out what happened

2694
02:37:36,384 --> 02:37:39,968
Who is very much asking about Mr madhaniyan when he was terminated

2695
02:37:50,720 --> 02:37:51,744
Actually mr. Jones

2696
02:37:52,256 --> 02:37:53,536
Your document production in this

2697
02:37:54,304 --> 02:37:56,096
Shows you did that in May 28th

2698
02:37:56,352 --> 02:37:57,888
Right after you

2699
02:37:58,400 --> 02:37:59,424
The truth of the matter mister

2700
02:37:59,680 --> 02:38:04,032
You knew immediately after being sued

2701
02:38:10,176 --> 02:38:10,944
Barnes

2702
02:38:15,808 --> 02:38:20,672
That's real

2703
02:38:20,928 --> 02:38:25,536
I believe he is under oath that you hear stuff like that

2704
02:38:27,584 --> 02:38:28,096
So

2705
02:38:28,352 --> 02:38:31,936
Do the lawyer wants to really nail down

2706
02:38:32,448 --> 02:38:33,472
Tease

2707
02:38:33,984 --> 02:38:36,800
How all of Alex's sources are really just Fetzer

2708
02:38:38,336 --> 02:38:39,104
And so

2709
02:38:39,360 --> 02:38:40,384
This is really into

2710
02:38:41,152 --> 02:38:43,200
Anna video Alex is saying that

2711
02:38:43,712 --> 02:38:44,224
You awake

2712
02:38:44,480 --> 02:38:50,624
Retired policeman in school investigators and they've all been threatened he's like creating the perception that they

2713
02:38:51,136 --> 02:38:51,904
Tom the people

2714
02:38:52,160 --> 02:38:54,720
Being frightened about Sandy Hook

2715
02:38:55,744 --> 02:38:57,024
This is this is just great

2716
02:38:57,536 --> 02:38:58,816
Mister Jones before we break

2717
02:38:59,072 --> 02:39:00,096
I asked you about

2718
02:39:00,352 --> 02:39:01,376
Your statement about what

2719
02:39:01,632 --> 02:39:02,400
State police officer

2720
02:39:02,656 --> 02:39:03,168
Threatened

2721
02:39:03,936 --> 02:39:05,216
He told me mister how big

2722
02:39:05,984 --> 02:39:06,496
Make somebody

2723
02:39:10,592 --> 02:39:11,360
Can you said that

2724
02:39:11,616 --> 02:39:13,920
School investigation experts were threatened

2725
02:39:14,176 --> 02:39:15,200
Who is that

2726
02:39:17,248 --> 02:39:20,576
There was some other groups and people matching questions

2727
02:39:21,088 --> 02:39:21,856
Other professors

2728
02:39:22,880 --> 02:39:23,648
Other than job

2729
02:39:28,000 --> 02:39:30,304
Even you said that in addition to those two groups

2730
02:39:30,816 --> 02:39:31,328
That

2731
02:39:31,584 --> 02:39:32,864
Some school safety expert

2732
02:39:37,216 --> 02:39:37,984
Righttime Enola

2733
02:39:43,616 --> 02:39:44,128
You're not

2734
02:39:44,384 --> 02:39:45,664
You're not years old

2735
02:39:46,176 --> 02:39:47,200
Shut the fuk up

2736
02:39:47,456 --> 02:39:52,064
You just answered yes by the way you said no is

2737
02:39:56,160 --> 02:39:56,928
Yeah that's bad

2738
02:39:57,184 --> 02:39:58,208
You just said yes

2739
02:40:00,000 --> 02:40:02,048
Maybe one of the other professors was James Tracey

2740
02:40:02,304 --> 02:40:04,864
Professors in the Bay Area

2741
02:40:05,376 --> 02:40:06,912
But all these other descriptions like

2742
02:40:07,424 --> 02:40:13,568
Retired state policeman and school investigator are being presented as two different people they are guests.

2743
02:40:13,824 --> 02:40:14,848
All of these

2744
02:40:15,104 --> 02:40:16,640
Trying to create

2745
02:40:16,896 --> 02:40:20,480
Chorus of folks who just got to do

2746
02:40:20,736 --> 02:40:23,808
I would like the stenographer

2747
02:40:24,064 --> 02:40:28,416
Make sure that the record shows while he did say no please put a parentheses

2748
02:40:28,672 --> 02:40:31,488
Yes right next to a beautiful lady

2749
02:40:32,256 --> 02:40:35,584
Wow asked about his narrative surrounding

2750
02:40:35,840 --> 02:40:36,352
Ambulances

2751
02:40:36,864 --> 02:40:39,680
At the school I don't think

2752
02:40:40,192 --> 02:40:40,960
Comes off looking

2753
02:40:42,240 --> 02:40:46,336
You setting up video ambulances came an hour and a half later that's not true right

2754
02:40:47,616 --> 02:40:51,968
Are you going to claim in this lawsuit

2755
02:40:59,648 --> 02:41:01,184
Backyard discovery

2756
02:41:04,256 --> 02:41:05,536
Wonka memory

2757
02:41:12,704 --> 02:41:13,984
What were the results of Utah

2758
02:41:18,592 --> 02:41:20,384
Whatever

2759
02:41:22,176 --> 02:41:22,688
Discovery

2760
02:41:29,600 --> 02:41:30,368
Correct

2761
02:41:34,976 --> 02:41:38,304
I don't have that problem

2762
02:41:38,816 --> 02:41:40,352
That's just nothing

2763
02:41:40,608 --> 02:41:41,376
That is

2764
02:41:41,888 --> 02:41:42,912
That is tragic

2765
02:41:43,168 --> 02:41:44,704
In Wisconsin

2766
02:41:44,960 --> 02:41:46,496
Judge just ruled

2767
02:41:46,752 --> 02:41:50,592
You know the 200,000 people could be purged from the voter

2768
02:41:51,104 --> 02:41:51,616
Because

2769
02:41:51,872 --> 02:41:54,432
They have to respond within 30 days

2770
02:41:54,688 --> 02:41:55,456
Do a change of address

2771
02:41:55,968 --> 02:41:58,528
And the judging is ruling literally is like

2772
02:41:58,784 --> 02:42:02,880
30 days I don't understand you can get it done in 30 days that's plenty of time

2773
02:42:04,160 --> 02:42:06,720
And that is how people are going to lose the right to vote

2774
02:42:06,976 --> 02:42:09,024
Alex can get away with this s***

2775
02:42:09,536 --> 02:42:10,560
That's unacceptable

2776
02:42:11,072 --> 02:42:15,936
That's unreal baby it's the end of the road I hope so

2777
02:42:16,192 --> 02:42:16,960
Because this is

2778
02:42:17,216 --> 02:42:23,360
I mean just this deposition alone should be enough to be like guilty I would be so fascinated to find out

2779
02:42:24,384 --> 02:42:26,944
Someone who likes Alex and believes him

2780
02:42:27,456 --> 02:42:29,504
How would they interpret these answers

2781
02:42:30,016 --> 02:42:31,040
How do you interpret

2782
02:42:31,296 --> 02:42:32,576
Like he's clear

2783
02:42:32,832 --> 02:42:34,112
Inability to

2784
02:42:34,624 --> 02:42:36,416
Answer any direct question when

2785
02:42:36,672 --> 02:42:37,952
Anything he

2786
02:42:38,208 --> 02:42:42,304
Should be saying would be completely sculptor anything

2787
02:42:42,560 --> 02:42:48,704
The key presents the way he presents himself on the show I have all this is all bruised and got all the documents yet if he had

2788
02:42:48,960 --> 02:42:51,520
Have any of these documents

2789
02:42:51,776 --> 02:42:57,920
This is the context we're in bringing that out that would be like oh okay well you Arkham

2790
02:42:58,176 --> 02:42:59,200
Completely

2791
02:42:59,456 --> 02:43:02,784
All right to do this and in fact all my God what's this

2792
02:43:03,040 --> 02:43:06,112
Yeah you weren't your correct here's here's the thing if

2793
02:43:06,624 --> 02:43:09,440
Anderson Cooper did a three-hour deposition

2794
02:43:09,952 --> 02:43:16,096
He answered every question confidently and clearly he had evidence backing up but there is one question

2795
02:43:16,352 --> 02:43:16,864
Action words like

2796
02:43:17,376 --> 02:43:19,936
Oh man I just don't have that one in front of me

2797
02:43:20,448 --> 02:43:23,264
One of Alex Jones listeners or Alex himself would have

2798
02:43:23,520 --> 02:43:24,800
Grab that clip of Ben like

2799
02:43:25,056 --> 02:43:28,640
See he's a lying. You can see it it's all a lie

2800
02:43:28,896 --> 02:43:33,504
But if somebody can watch this deposition and not Come Away with being like

2801
02:43:33,760 --> 02:43:35,552
Oh that guy did everything you say

2802
02:43:36,064 --> 02:43:37,600
It's

2803
02:43:38,112 --> 02:43:39,136
Weird I just don't

2804
02:43:39,904 --> 02:43:41,696
I don't know how

2805
02:43:42,208 --> 02:43:46,816
It would be interpreted like

2806
02:43:47,072 --> 02:43:50,912
What is the what is the logical explanation for why

2807
02:43:51,424 --> 02:43:52,960
He is behaving like that

2808
02:43:53,216 --> 02:43:54,240
Other than

2809
02:43:54,752 --> 02:43:56,032
Flippant disregard

2810
02:43:56,800 --> 02:43:58,592
Because that's not really a good

2811
02:43:58,848 --> 02:44:00,640
If you consider like

2812
02:44:00,896 --> 02:44:02,432
Worst case scenario

2813
02:44:02,688 --> 02:44:07,552
You going to lose tons and tons of money and possibly become financially unviable as business

2814
02:44:07,808 --> 02:44:09,600
Best case scenario

2815
02:44:10,624 --> 02:44:16,768
Gets away with everything and everything is good why wouldn't you tend towards behaviors that would be

2816
02:44:17,024 --> 02:44:18,304
Towards the better outcome

2817
02:44:18,560 --> 02:44:23,168
Acting like this is only going to make it more likely that the bad outcome happen

2818
02:44:23,936 --> 02:44:26,496
You not acting in his own best interest

2819
02:44:27,008 --> 02:44:28,800
And that implies to me

2820
02:44:29,568 --> 02:44:32,128
Can't acting is best if there is no best case scenario

2821
02:44:32,640 --> 02:44:36,992
Best-case scenario for him as he loses and gets to stay he still wanting some

2822
02:44:37,248 --> 02:44:38,272
Sure you know

2823
02:44:38,528 --> 02:44:41,600
So now the lawyer plays the video of Alex

2824
02:44:41,856 --> 02:44:47,488
Talk to a collar and saying I didn't believe it at first but Sandy Hook was totally fake there no kids

2825
02:44:47,744 --> 02:44:49,536
Kildare and all of that

2826
02:44:50,048 --> 02:44:56,192
I don't recall that I'll have a well when pressed on it his explanation of what his show is

2827
02:44:56,960 --> 02:44:59,264
Is very bizarre luminaid

2828
02:45:00,032 --> 02:45:01,056
Legitimately

2829
02:45:01,568 --> 02:45:02,592
Looking at

2830
02:45:04,384 --> 02:45:05,408
Going back and forth

2831
02:45:07,456 --> 02:45:09,760
Yeah you said both things and then you said things that were true

2832
02:45:14,880 --> 02:45:19,232
Let's just go and use your word opinion even though we all but we all know that not an opinion

2833
02:45:19,744 --> 02:45:21,024
Your opinion is full

2834
02:45:22,048 --> 02:45:22,560
Kids

2835
02:45:22,816 --> 02:45:24,096
Died

2836
02:45:24,608 --> 02:45:26,144
Right and I didn't kill

2837
02:45:27,424 --> 02:45:29,984
You see me anywhere in this deposition saying you killed shoulder

2838
02:45:33,824 --> 02:45:37,408
You think you're here cuz you killed children that's the echo but it is like I'm Adam Lanza

2839
02:45:40,224 --> 02:45:43,808
Responsible for the things you

2840
02:45:45,856 --> 02:45:52,000
If I put a journalistic report and said this is fact then that would be what I want to show talking about how I

2841
02:45:52,256 --> 02:45:54,816
My feelings and say that

2842
02:45:55,328 --> 02:45:57,120
I would say I'm gone all over the map

2843
02:46:00,192 --> 02:46:00,704
This is internal

2844
02:46:01,472 --> 02:46:02,240
Absolutely not

2845
02:46:04,287 --> 02:46:05,823
Talk about my feelings

2846
02:46:06,591 --> 02:46:12,735
So apparently Infowars is Alex talking about his feelings unless directly

2847
02:46:12,991 --> 02:46:13,759
Presented as fact

2848
02:46:14,015 --> 02:46:19,903
Which again b b opinion

2849
02:46:20,159 --> 02:46:26,303
Feet now in earlier in his child custody case when his lawyer said that he's playing a character

2850
02:46:26,815 --> 02:46:30,143
Mated your character and that's me it's a compelling cuz it's

2851
02:46:30,399 --> 02:46:32,191
Lawyer and also it's in the car

2852
02:46:32,447 --> 02:46:34,495
Context like a family case

2853
02:46:35,007 --> 02:46:36,543
All very messy

2854
02:46:36,799 --> 02:46:42,943
This is Alex directly under old saying of my show is mostly be talking about my feet like this

2855
02:46:43,199 --> 02:46:43,711
Yep

2856
02:46:43,967 --> 02:46:45,247
Buy show is

2857
02:46:45,503 --> 02:46:50,111
The closest that I can get to therapy as a

2858
02:46:50,367 --> 02:46:51,135
Toxic male

2859
02:46:51,391 --> 02:46:52,927
That's what I've got this is

2860
02:46:53,183 --> 02:46:54,975
The area I would like

2861
02:46:55,231 --> 02:46:59,071
Things to go in wearing now we look at the show as

2862
02:46:59,327 --> 02:47:02,399
What is the say about his feet

2863
02:47:03,167 --> 02:47:06,495
Not the interpretive Direction I want the show to ya

2864
02:47:06,751 --> 02:47:08,543
But it's going to be hard for me not to

2865
02:47:08,799 --> 02:47:09,311
About that

2866
02:47:09,567 --> 02:47:11,615
A lot of this could just be a manifestation

2867
02:47:12,127 --> 02:47:12,895
What you

2868
02:47:13,151 --> 02:47:13,663
Feel

2869
02:47:13,919 --> 02:47:19,295
Right but it's presented as being backed by the white paper

2870
02:47:20,063 --> 02:47:23,903
That's not good baby just joint nonsensical thing

2871
02:47:24,159 --> 02:47:26,463
I don't know the thing about the deposition

2872
02:47:26,975 --> 02:47:28,255
Especially here

2873
02:47:28,511 --> 02:47:30,303
Is I don't know

2874
02:47:30,815 --> 02:47:32,863
Whether or not he believes anything he's

2875
02:47:33,887 --> 02:47:35,935
That's true I just I can't

2876
02:47:36,191 --> 02:47:39,519
Because there's so much of him here that is

2877
02:47:39,775 --> 02:47:44,127
Wriggling that is desperation

2878
02:47:44,639 --> 02:47:49,759
Noemi even tried in one of the clips that you played earlier I noticed that he was trying that like

2879
02:47:50,783 --> 02:47:54,879
Apologize to Authority kind of way of getting out of

2880
02:47:55,135 --> 02:48:01,279
Something like yeah you know what you're right we made some mistakes I'm sorry about that will work to fix that in the future

2881
02:48:01,535 --> 02:48:07,679
As though he was talking to his boss you know instead of being like

2882
02:48:07,935 --> 02:48:14,079
It really does feel like he thinks he's talking to somebody who can make it all go away if they just

2883
02:48:14,335 --> 02:48:17,151
Decide to leave him alone

2884
02:48:17,407 --> 02:48:18,431
That's weird that's wild

2885
02:48:18,687 --> 02:48:21,247
So Alex wants to talk about Epstein

2886
02:48:23,295 --> 02:48:24,831
That's interesting because

2887
02:48:25,087 --> 02:48:25,855
It's a deposition

2888
02:48:26,111 --> 02:48:27,391
About

2889
02:48:27,647 --> 02:48:32,511
This I believe whatever he says now I believe he's

2890
02:48:32,767 --> 02:48:36,607
Which strange is Alex should have known

2891
02:48:37,119 --> 02:48:43,263
That something was up because the lawyer does want to talk about it

2892
02:48:45,055 --> 02:48:51,199
Still doesn't God bringing up apps

2893
02:48:51,455 --> 02:48:57,599
You will get that I know and I know Alex I'll be like Legend never ever speak

2894
02:48:57,855 --> 02:49:01,951
You know what actually a good point that this lawyer is going to make

2895
02:49:02,207 --> 02:49:07,583
He just doesn't get that he doesn't get that he thinks they're having a conversation not the lawyer spend

2896
02:49:08,095 --> 02:49:11,679
Hours and weeks preparing for this exact interview

2897
02:49:15,775 --> 02:49:17,823
I think maybe number taken gasket

2898
02:49:18,591 --> 02:49:20,639
But I think one of the things that you and I agree

2899
02:49:22,687 --> 02:49:23,455
Large segments

2900
02:49:26,527 --> 02:49:27,295
Indeed the world

2901
02:49:28,575 --> 02:49:29,087
Psychopath

2902
02:49:32,927 --> 02:49:34,463
And in fact because of that

2903
02:49:35,231 --> 02:49:37,791
Wendy's really really strange happenings of Pepsi

2904
02:49:38,815 --> 02:49:40,095
When Epstein killed himself

2905
02:49:40,351 --> 02:49:40,863
Incel

2906
02:49:41,887 --> 02:49:43,167
When you're supposed to be underwater

2907
02:49:43,679 --> 02:49:44,447
My federal officials

2908
02:49:47,007 --> 02:49:47,775
Suspicious to save them

2909
02:49:50,335 --> 02:49:51,871
I think a lot of people in this country

2910
02:49:52,895 --> 02:49:54,431
Think it's most likely true

2911
02:49:57,759 --> 02:49:58,527
A lot of people think

2912
02:49:59,807 --> 02:50:02,623
And now it seems a massive public figure he's been in the news

2913
02:50:05,183 --> 02:50:07,743
Partially because of something called the Lolita Express

2914
02:50:08,255 --> 02:50:08,767
Yes

2915
02:50:11,583 --> 02:50:13,119
And we in this country gets talked about public

2916
02:50:13,631 --> 02:50:14,143
When you agree

2917
02:50:15,679 --> 02:50:16,191
Two things

2918
02:50:16,447 --> 02:50:19,007
One Alex be terrified

2919
02:50:19,263 --> 02:50:25,407
Right now my hackles are ready I sent something bad coming around this quarter

2920
02:50:25,663 --> 02:50:26,175
Do you like

2921
02:50:27,455 --> 02:50:30,271
Standing

2922
02:50:30,527 --> 02:50:35,135
The second thing is you can tell how much differently Alex respond

2923
02:50:35,391 --> 02:50:41,535
These are direct yes or no quick answers you're on my team yes yeah yeah yeah

2924
02:50:41,791 --> 02:50:44,095
I'm here

2925
02:50:44,607 --> 02:50:50,751
He doesn't realize that the entire abusive bring up Epstein is to use it as a case study

2926
02:50:51,007 --> 02:50:56,127
About why it's okay to say whatever you want about Jeffrey Epstein but it's not

2927
02:50:56,383 --> 02:50:58,943
For someone else let's say

2928
02:50:59,455 --> 02:51:01,247
That there is a security guard

2929
02:51:02,015 --> 02:51:03,039
At that federal penitentiary

2930
02:51:04,063 --> 02:51:04,831
Missing Bob

2931
02:51:06,623 --> 02:51:08,159
You want to get on TV and say

2932
02:51:08,927 --> 02:51:10,207
Bob Smith killed

2933
02:51:11,487 --> 02:51:12,511
And you were wrong

2934
02:51:13,535 --> 02:51:14,559
You be held responsible

2935
02:51:15,583 --> 02:51:17,631
Private citizen

2936
02:51:17,887 --> 02:51:18,655
Gorman

2937
02:51:18,911 --> 02:51:19,679
Trying to get on the news

2938
02:51:20,959 --> 02:51:23,775
Issues

2939
02:51:24,031 --> 02:51:24,799
Question

2940
02:51:25,311 --> 02:51:27,871
Weather was whether whether Bob was involved or not

2941
02:51:28,383 --> 02:51:28,895
Didn't know

2942
02:51:34,015 --> 02:51:35,295
Is that okay if you're wrong

2943
02:51:35,551 --> 02:51:37,855
Where does Bob Smith dies responsibilities Bob Smith

2944
02:51:38,623 --> 02:51:39,135
Make that right

2945
02:51:40,159 --> 02:51:41,183
Not if I did it

2946
02:51:41,439 --> 02:51:43,231
Out of out of your believing it was true

2947
02:51:43,743 --> 02:51:44,767
That is a weird line

2948
02:51:45,791 --> 02:51:50,655
But he Alex's pretty far off the beaten path is there in terms of

2949
02:51:51,167 --> 02:51:54,239
His understanding of what is appropriate with private

2950
02:51:54,495 --> 02:51:56,287
Public figures

2951
02:51:56,799 --> 02:52:00,383
Things they try to lay out is that

2952
02:52:00,895 --> 02:52:01,663
Bye

2953
02:52:01,919 --> 02:52:06,527
Implying in and saying directly that no one died there

2954
02:52:06,783 --> 02:52:09,855
What you're doing is accusing all of these people of gigantic crime

2955
02:52:10,623 --> 02:52:13,439
Not only because they're involved in some elaborate hoax

2956
02:52:13,695 --> 02:52:15,231
But because let's say

2957
02:52:15,743 --> 02:52:19,583
If you're a parent and your child it didn't die

2958
02:52:19,839 --> 02:52:25,727
You have filed false police report like there's all sorts of implied crimes there a host

2959
02:52:25,983 --> 02:52:27,263
Yeah so bye

2960
02:52:27,519 --> 02:52:29,823
Behaving in this way you are making

2961
02:52:30,335 --> 02:52:31,359
Criminal accusations

2962
02:52:31,615 --> 02:52:33,919
The gas people whether or not you directly say it

2963
02:52:34,431 --> 02:52:38,271
Play the games like I didn't say these peoples name

2964
02:52:38,527 --> 02:52:39,807
Like what you said

2965
02:52:40,575 --> 02:52:42,367
My clients son did.

2966
02:52:42,623 --> 02:52:46,207
Because you said no one died you are talkin about that

2967
02:52:46,463 --> 02:52:48,511
I would like to

2968
02:52:49,023 --> 02:52:50,559
Ask you to explain that

2969
02:52:50,815 --> 02:52:52,607
Because I

2970
02:52:52,863 --> 02:52:59,007
Because it's clear that this

2971
02:52:59,263 --> 02:52:59,775
Down the road

2972
02:53:00,031 --> 02:53:01,823
It's going to snow

2973
02:53:02,079 --> 02:53:04,127
A private vs public figures

2974
02:53:04,383 --> 02:53:06,431
Alex just starts rambling

2975
02:53:06,687 --> 02:53:10,783
Probably one of my bigger laughs of the of the whole procedure

2976
02:53:11,295 --> 02:53:16,159
Some stuff really

2977
02:53:23,071 --> 02:53:24,863
It's hard to believe that

2978
02:53:25,631 --> 02:53:27,423
That's all

2979
02:53:30,239 --> 02:53:31,263
You know questionnaire answers

2980
02:53:32,287 --> 02:53:38,431
A large question about

2981
02:53:38,687 --> 02:53:41,247
A couple things about

2982
02:53:42,271 --> 02:53:44,575
It comes down to with your Converse

2983
02:53:44,831 --> 02:53:45,343
Sullivan

2984
02:53:48,415 --> 02:53:49,695
Intentionally on l

2985
02:53:49,951 --> 02:53:50,975
Tried to hurt people

2986
02:53:51,231 --> 02:53:52,767
My questioning big public event

2987
02:53:53,279 --> 02:53:56,607
We need to question

2988
02:53:56,863 --> 02:53:59,423
We don't worry North Korea I asked you sir

2989
02:53:59,935 --> 02:54:01,215
Would you be responsible to Bob

2990
02:54:03,007 --> 02:54:05,567
And I told you that it would be

2991
02:54:05,823 --> 02:54:06,335
Pacific

2992
02:54:10,431 --> 02:54:11,711
Yeah

2993
02:54:11,967 --> 02:54:13,759
Access

2994
02:54:14,271 --> 02:54:17,343
Dr. Bob

2995
02:54:18,879 --> 02:54:21,439
I was doing

2996
02:54:21,951 --> 02:54:22,463
No

2997
02:54:22,975 --> 02:54:23,743
Then I'm cool

2998
02:54:25,279 --> 02:54:26,047
Out

2999
02:54:26,815 --> 02:54:29,631
That's probably not the case with private citizens

3000
02:54:29,887 --> 02:54:35,775
Ashley if you're relying on people like Jim's Restaurant

3001
02:54:36,031 --> 02:54:36,799
For no reason

3002
02:54:37,055 --> 02:54:38,335
Okay so

3003
02:54:39,615 --> 02:54:40,127
That's

3004
02:54:40,383 --> 02:54:40,895
That's insane

3005
02:54:41,919 --> 02:54:42,431
That's

3006
02:54:43,967 --> 02:54:44,479
God

3007
02:54:44,735 --> 02:54:46,015
You know what question

3008
02:54:46,783 --> 02:54:48,575
I love that that's my favorite

3009
02:54:48,831 --> 02:54:51,135
That's my favorite line of the entire day

3010
02:54:51,391 --> 02:54:52,415
Yeah cuz I've always

3011
02:54:52,671 --> 02:54:57,535
I've always wanted to ask you exactly what's up

3012
02:54:57,791 --> 02:55:00,351
Through a lot of s***

3013
02:55:00,607 --> 02:55:01,375
So

3014
02:55:01,887 --> 02:55:06,751
One of Alex's big defenses is basically that he believes

3015
02:55:07,007 --> 02:55:08,799
That the family members are Publix

3016
02:55:09,311 --> 02:55:15,455
He believes that just by virtue of them being victims and family members of a tragedy

3017
02:55:15,711 --> 02:55:16,991
Have entered the arena

3018
02:55:17,247 --> 02:55:20,319
Whatever no fault of their own

3019
02:55:20,831 --> 02:55:21,599
Massive amount

3020
02:55:21,855 --> 02:55:22,367
Immediate

3021
02:55:22,879 --> 02:55:23,391
On them

3022
02:55:23,647 --> 02:55:25,695
Has that's raised them into public figures

3023
02:55:25,951 --> 02:55:29,279
Opening them up to now it's interesting because

3024
02:55:30,559 --> 02:55:31,327
Literally

3025
02:55:31,583 --> 02:55:32,607
Courts of rule

3026
02:55:34,143 --> 02:55:37,471
Well there's that respond well to that being brought up

3027
02:55:37,727 --> 02:55:39,775
Okay but what I'm trying to get to you

3028
02:55:40,287 --> 02:55:41,823
Did you agree that there's a difference

3029
02:55:42,591 --> 02:55:44,127
To an internationally recognized

3030
02:55:44,383 --> 02:55:44,895
Famous person

3031
02:55:45,663 --> 02:55:46,687
And a person spitting

3032
02:55:47,455 --> 02:55:49,759
Millions if not billions

3033
02:55:51,807 --> 02:55:53,599
At a private citizen

3034
02:55:57,183 --> 02:55:58,975
There is a difference in journalistic ethics

3035
02:56:05,631 --> 02:56:07,679
And at the end of the day with a private person

3036
02:56:08,191 --> 02:56:10,495
You would agree with me the info work needs to take

3037
02:56:10,751 --> 02:56:11,519
Appropriate

3038
02:56:12,031 --> 02:56:13,823
Make sure reporting phone

3039
02:56:15,615 --> 02:56:16,639
Most of all we do

3040
02:56:16,895 --> 02:56:18,687
Upon entry and opinion

3041
02:56:19,199 --> 02:56:20,223
When

3042
02:56:20,479 --> 02:56:22,271
Parents and others become

3043
02:56:22,527 --> 02:56:25,087
I would figure that go out with a political

3044
02:56:25,599 --> 02:56:26,367
Mission 2

3045
02:56:26,623 --> 02:56:28,415
Chuchu restrict gun ownership

3046
02:56:29,951 --> 02:56:30,719
Into the arena

3047
02:56:32,511 --> 02:56:33,023
Unicorn

3048
02:56:34,047 --> 02:56:35,839
Protection

3049
02:56:36,095 --> 02:56:38,143
Will you were involved in a lawsuit

3050
02:56:38,655 --> 02:56:40,447
Veronique Delarosa

3051
02:56:43,007 --> 02:56:45,567
Reno Texas court of appeals came back and told you they're not Papa

3052
02:56:48,895 --> 02:56:49,663
Democrats Court

3053
02:56:55,295 --> 02:56:56,063
Sure they'll be delighted

3054
02:56:58,879 --> 02:57:00,159
What's a Democrat

3055
02:57:01,183 --> 02:57:01,951
Yeah

3056
02:57:03,231 --> 02:57:04,255
Alright so

3057
02:57:04,511 --> 02:57:07,327
Essentially he believes that no law can be made

3058
02:57:07,839 --> 02:57:10,143
Unless it's made by people who agree with him

3059
02:57:10,399 --> 02:57:13,983
And he doesn't have to follow any law

3060
02:57:14,495 --> 02:57:16,031
Eddie Eddie Lovette a Democrat

3061
02:57:16,543 --> 02:57:17,311
Judge

3062
02:57:17,567 --> 02:57:20,127
Says it's real. Seems that way gacha

3063
02:57:20,383 --> 02:57:21,663
Cuz they're all demon Club

3064
02:57:21,919 --> 02:57:22,431
Right

3065
02:57:22,687 --> 02:57:24,735
I mean that is the logical

3066
02:57:24,991 --> 02:57:28,063
That is a logical extension is he actually believes that there

3067
02:57:28,319 --> 02:57:30,623
All out together in a conspiracy

3068
02:57:31,135 --> 02:57:32,671
Take a break

3069
02:57:32,927 --> 02:57:37,023
Come back there's just a couple minutes left here where we get

3070
02:57:38,047 --> 02:57:39,583
You got to update on Barnes

3071
02:57:39,839 --> 02:57:43,167
Should I get the disc mounts right and then we also get first

3072
02:57:43,423 --> 02:57:43,935
Alex

3073
02:57:44,703 --> 02:57:48,031
Needing to clarify something about his sources

3074
02:57:48,799 --> 02:57:49,823
They don't exist

3075
02:57:50,079 --> 02:57:51,871
I find this to be weird

3076
02:57:52,383 --> 02:57:55,967
Clarify something

3077
02:57:57,247 --> 02:57:58,783
Open clarify my route

3078
02:57:59,295 --> 02:58:00,831
You kept asking about

3079
02:58:01,343 --> 02:58:03,903
Sources and at Willy's horses are

3080
02:58:04,415 --> 02:58:05,183
We have articles

3081
02:58:05,439 --> 02:58:06,975
Thanks.

3082
02:58:07,743 --> 02:58:08,255
And so

3083
02:58:09,279 --> 02:58:10,559
I've given you

3084
02:58:10,815 --> 02:58:12,095
Everything we've got

3085
02:58:15,935 --> 02:58:17,983
Thanks to other sources

3086
02:58:18,239 --> 02:58:19,519
Are online

3087
02:58:23,359 --> 02:58:24,127
Anything that

3088
02:58:24,383 --> 02:58:29,247
We have to give you is outside of my office in my office when you say a source

3089
02:58:29,759 --> 02:58:32,319
That was a few newspapers in archives and TV reports

3090
02:58:32,575 --> 02:58:35,135
That are outside of my office on the internet

3091
02:58:35,391 --> 02:58:36,671
Your forces are things that I'm

3092
02:58:36,927 --> 02:58:38,975
Thinking about to go out and find

3093
02:58:39,487 --> 02:58:42,303
So

3094
02:58:44,863 --> 02:58:45,887
You degrees it's not

3095
02:58:46,143 --> 02:58:46,655
General practice

3096
02:58:46,911 --> 02:58:48,703
This is not part of your operating protocols

3097
02:58:49,471 --> 02:58:49,983
To save

3098
02:58:50,495 --> 02:58:51,519
Corroborating information

3099
02:58:51,775 --> 02:58:52,287
Underline

3100
02:58:57,151 --> 02:59:00,991
We we save some other than overtime it

3101
02:59:04,063 --> 02:59:07,135
Information

3102
02:59:07,391 --> 02:59:07,903
Call wife

3103
02:59:08,159 --> 02:59:10,207
Most of what we have is

3104
02:59:10,719 --> 02:59:11,999
Is Article 4 Linx

3105
02:59:14,815 --> 02:59:15,327
The links

3106
02:59:15,583 --> 02:59:16,863
Go to outside websites

3107
02:59:17,375 --> 02:59:18,911
Outside TV station to network

3108
02:59:20,191 --> 02:59:20,703
That's what I go by

3109
02:59:21,215 --> 02:59:23,775
Remember where I got something

3110
02:59:24,287 --> 02:59:25,055
I need to go back

3111
02:59:25,567 --> 02:59:27,359
Articles that you've been given

3112
02:59:27,615 --> 02:59:28,895
Call the Links

3113
02:59:29,151 --> 02:59:29,919
Through their mother

3114
02:59:30,175 --> 02:59:31,711
Olink

3115
02:59:31,967 --> 02:59:34,015
Always links II

3116
02:59:34,271 --> 02:59:40,415
He's so unusual the concept of a follow-up question Jordan that explains everything

3117
02:59:40,671 --> 02:59:42,207
Thought that he came up with a brilliant

3118
02:59:43,231 --> 02:59:46,047
You really did think he really thought that okay

3119
02:59:47,327 --> 02:59:53,215
Look you're a newbie to my whole version of Journalism all right so when I have a source now this

3120
02:59:53,471 --> 02:59:55,007
A lot of other journalistic out

3121
02:59:55,263 --> 02:59:57,311
Outlets don't do this

3122
02:59:57,567 --> 02:59:58,591
All I'll do is,

3123
02:59:58,847 --> 02:59:59,359
Hyperlink

3124
02:59:59,615 --> 03:00:01,407
You know what I'm just going to call it a wake

3125
03:00:01,663 --> 03:00:02,687
Hyperlink might be a little hard

3126
03:00:03,711 --> 03:00:09,855
I'll make one of the words like a little blue right and you click on it and that's my source right now.

3127
03:00:10,111 --> 03:00:12,159
Internet never heard of

3128
03:00:12,671 --> 03:00:16,255
And who knows what's going to get burnt so when you click on the link sometimes

3129
03:00:16,767 --> 03:00:19,327
Not there anymore I'm sorry this all makes sense

3130
03:00:19,583 --> 03:00:22,655
Please do not follow up with any other question

3131
03:00:23,167 --> 03:00:23,679
That's

3132
03:00:24,703 --> 03:00:26,751
I'm flabbergasted

3133
03:00:27,007 --> 03:00:28,543
By this level of

3134
03:00:28,799 --> 03:00:32,127
Needing to clarify that I really think

3135
03:00:32,383 --> 03:00:33,407
He seems to be thinking

3136
03:00:33,663 --> 03:00:35,199
You know what the great defense

3137
03:00:35,455 --> 03:00:41,599
Sometimes some of these links are dead later gone you've already talked about the Wayback machine

3138
03:00:41,855 --> 03:00:46,975
I understand that but that's only for traffic on school websites day I forgot didn't you know that

3139
03:00:47,231 --> 03:00:48,255
Forgot that's all it was

3140
03:00:48,511 --> 03:00:53,887
So here we get to this update on lawyer

3141
03:00:54,143 --> 03:00:54,911
Certainly not Alex

3142
03:00:55,423 --> 03:00:56,703
Understand

3143
03:00:57,727 --> 03:00:58,495
Liquor Barn

3144
03:00:59,263 --> 03:00:59,775
Robert Barr

3145
03:01:00,287 --> 03:01:01,567
No longer representing

3146
03:01:02,847 --> 03:01:04,383
Is he still employed by the company

3147
03:01:06,175 --> 03:01:07,199
General Counseling in now

3148
03:01:09,247 --> 03:01:11,807
While he was there to do you have any managerial responsibilities

3149
03:01:16,159 --> 03:01:16,927
Do you have any director

3150
03:01:19,743 --> 03:01:21,023
Did he at one point service

3151
03:01:26,143 --> 03:01:27,167
What was that mean you trying to

3152
03:01:28,703 --> 03:01:29,983
I was just trying to get the case of

3153
03:01:31,263 --> 03:01:31,775
Dyspraxia

3154
03:01:34,079 --> 03:01:39,711
I wonder if that line of questioning has anything to do with like a suspicion that he was doing more

3155
03:01:40,735 --> 03:01:41,247
I don't know

3156
03:01:41,503 --> 03:01:42,527
Could this be

3157
03:01:42,783 --> 03:01:44,063
Start of standard question

3158
03:01:44,319 --> 03:01:45,343
Stop

3159
03:01:47,391 --> 03:01:51,743
Frequently Barnes was appearing on Infowars Alex said he was going to give him a show

3160
03:01:52,255 --> 03:01:53,535
It does seem to like

3161
03:01:53,791 --> 03:01:58,655
The fact that that line of questioning was he a director it Infowars roll

3162
03:02:00,447 --> 03:02:04,799
Makes me think that they might have a different suspicion but I might be over reading

3163
03:02:05,311 --> 03:02:07,615
I don't know the first thing that I thought

3164
03:02:07,871 --> 03:02:08,383
Weis

3165
03:02:08,895 --> 03:02:09,663
What they're asking

3166
03:02:09,919 --> 03:02:10,687
4A

3167
03:02:11,455 --> 03:02:12,991
You didn't disclose some

3168
03:02:13,759 --> 03:02:17,343
Like there's some communication between you and Barnes or

3169
03:02:17,599 --> 03:02:18,111
Between

3170
03:02:18,367 --> 03:02:18,879
Somebody

3171
03:02:19,135 --> 03:02:21,695
That you guys didn't disclose or wonder

3172
03:02:21,951 --> 03:02:28,095
That's that's the only thing I can think of in there and your argument that you didn't disclose it is because he wasn't an employee or a man

3173
03:02:29,119 --> 03:02:30,911
I wonder if that's the case

3174
03:02:31,167 --> 03:02:32,447
But it could be just now

3175
03:02:32,703 --> 03:02:34,495
Yeah I know it could just be

3176
03:02:34,751 --> 03:02:39,103
Is Byrne still around

3177
03:02:39,615 --> 03:02:40,895
So here's the last clip

3178
03:02:42,431 --> 03:02:44,223
Alex being asked if he's sorry

3179
03:02:44,991 --> 03:02:46,783
He's not

3180
03:02:47,039 --> 03:02:48,319
And is Big dismal

3181
03:02:49,343 --> 03:02:51,647
I want to ask you now looking back on this

3182
03:02:52,415 --> 03:02:52,927
Are you sorry

3183
03:02:54,207 --> 03:02:56,255
Good place in my heart

3184
03:02:58,047 --> 03:02:59,327
So much

3185
03:02:59,583 --> 03:03:05,215
That's so much that.

3186
03:03:05,983 --> 03:03:07,007
Wow

3187
03:03:08,287 --> 03:03:11,103
Everything I've done has been from a place of really Prime

3188
03:03:12,639 --> 03:03:13,407
Truth

3189
03:03:20,575 --> 03:03:22,367
So I'mma roll proud

3190
03:03:22,879 --> 03:03:24,159
Skeptical

3191
03:03:25,695 --> 03:03:26,207
Selves

3192
03:03:28,255 --> 03:03:28,767
Let me get this

3193
03:03:29,279 --> 03:03:30,559
These videos we just watch today

3194
03:03:31,327 --> 03:03:32,095
You're proud

3195
03:03:32,607 --> 03:03:33,119
Video

3196
03:03:34,143 --> 03:03:36,703
I'm proud of the compendium of my work not

3197
03:03:37,215 --> 03:03:37,983
Small quick steak

3198
03:03:39,263 --> 03:03:40,287
And I'm a good person

3199
03:03:50,783 --> 03:03:51,807
Little Bill

3200
03:03:52,831 --> 03:03:57,183
We were wrong about you.

3201
03:03:58,207 --> 03:03:59,999
What you say

.

3204
03:04:12,799 --> 03:04:18,943
So when Epstein didn't kill himself he's going to go out on a meat that's his plan

3205
03:04:19,199 --> 03:04:25,343
Alex is deposition

3206
03:04:28,159 --> 03:04:29,695
That's horrible and stuff

3207
03:04:29,951 --> 03:04:33,791
Wow it's strong stuff from everybody has really

3208
03:04:34,047 --> 03:04:34,815
This

3209
03:04:36,351 --> 03:04:37,375
I wanted to

3210
03:04:37,631 --> 03:04:39,935
Present-day episode 4

3211
03:04:40,191 --> 03:04:41,471
Today because

3212
03:04:41,727 --> 03:04:43,519
I want find out if you did that surgery

3213
03:04:43,775 --> 03:04:45,823
Studio

3214
03:04:47,359 --> 03:04:52,991
People ripping computer chips out of there

3215
03:04:53,503 --> 03:04:55,295
Sometimes things happen

3216
03:04:55,551 --> 03:04:56,319
It's on a curveball

3217
03:04:56,575 --> 03:04:59,135
You got to watch seven hours of testimony

3218
03:04:59,391 --> 03:05:00,927
From these abuse

3219
03:05:01,183 --> 03:05:03,487
Obfuscating weirdo

3220
03:05:03,999 --> 03:05:05,279
I I can't

3221
03:05:07,071 --> 03:05:08,351
I can't hang with him

3222
03:05:08,863 --> 03:05:09,375
Being like

3223
03:05:09,887 --> 03:05:12,959
You know it's really sad that the mainstream media isn't

3224
03:05:13,215 --> 03:05:16,031
Trusted enough anymore that my brand of

3225
03:05:16,543 --> 03:05:18,079
F****** with people

3226
03:05:18,335 --> 03:05:19,103
Is it

3227
03:05:19,359 --> 03:05:21,919
Like it's almost like him being like well it's

3228
03:05:22,175 --> 03:05:22,943
Your fault

3229
03:05:23,199 --> 03:05:29,343
Did I even have a Jew baby do you guys made this face because sometimes you get things wrong

3230
03:05:29,599 --> 03:05:35,231
I can lie and this is your fault

3231
03:05:35,487 --> 03:05:37,535
Manifesting

3232
03:05:37,791 --> 03:05:39,583
Yeah it's a very

3233
03:05:39,839 --> 03:05:40,863
And Alex you're not

3234
03:05:41,631 --> 03:05:44,191
Tyson

3235
03:05:44,447 --> 03:05:49,055
What is so interesting to me is how all of these three

3236
03:05:49,311 --> 03:05:50,335
Are so different

3237
03:05:50,847 --> 03:05:52,127
10 inseam

3238
03:05:52,383 --> 03:05:54,175
Wow

3239
03:05:54,687 --> 03:06:00,063
The feeling is so very different like Paul covering his ass kind of 100

3240
03:06:00,319 --> 03:06:02,623
Agreeable agreeable

3241
03:06:02,879 --> 03:06:04,159
Light weekend

3242
03:06:04,415 --> 03:06:05,695
Yeah you being cooked

3243
03:06:05,951 --> 03:06:09,535
Completely underwater not knowing what he's doing no

3244
03:06:09,791 --> 03:06:11,071
I can't believe that that

3245
03:06:11,327 --> 03:06:16,703
I genuinely can't believe it's legal I really can't believe that what he did is illegal and then Alex

3246
03:06:16,959 --> 03:06:17,471
Being Alex

3247
03:06:17,727 --> 03:06:19,007
But also just

3248
03:06:20,031 --> 03:06:21,567
The feeling that I get

3249
03:06:22,335 --> 03:06:25,151
Watching this deposition as opposed to the last one

3250
03:06:25,407 --> 03:06:27,455
Is it feels like Alex's

3251
03:06:27,711 --> 03:06:33,855
Closer to the wall like it feels like a room is closing a little bit he's out his ability to dodge things

3252
03:06:34,367 --> 03:06:35,135
Is

3253
03:06:35,391 --> 03:06:36,927
Greatly diminished

3254
03:06:37,183 --> 03:06:40,767
Without Barnes there just yelling objection all the time

3255
03:06:41,023 --> 03:06:45,887
It kind of Hit the flow of the the questioning is much different

3256
03:06:46,143 --> 03:06:50,751
The lawyer not having to deal with Barnes Antics makes him

3257
03:06:51,007 --> 03:06:52,543
Way more effective

3258
03:06:52,799 --> 03:06:54,591
And the way that like

3259
03:06:55,103 --> 03:06:57,919
Repeatedly Alex would do those things like the babies

3260
03:06:58,175 --> 03:07:00,223
Incubators and the way it's just like

3261
03:07:00,479 --> 03:07:06,623
Say whatever you need to say I'm going to proceed not allowing him to do those pivots and Dodges like

3262
03:07:07,391 --> 03:07:08,927
You can see what happens then

3263
03:07:09,183 --> 03:07:10,719
Yeah I know it's okay

3264
03:07:10,975 --> 03:07:12,767
Patient with

3265
03:07:13,023 --> 03:07:15,071
He's like okay we have your little tantrum

3266
03:07:15,327 --> 03:07:19,167
Then we're going to come right back here I'm not going to engage with you

3267
03:07:19,423 --> 03:07:20,703
I'm not going to do man

3268
03:07:20,959 --> 03:07:23,007
That really bums me out

3269
03:07:23,263 --> 03:07:25,823
That that's true because that suggests

3270
03:07:26,079 --> 03:07:26,591
Then

3271
03:07:27,359 --> 03:07:28,639
That Barn's

3272
03:07:28,895 --> 03:07:33,503
Did Alex a good job

3273
03:07:34,271 --> 03:07:40,415
He was serviceable being like a complete

3274
03:07:40,671 --> 03:07:43,487
Accessories

3275
03:07:44,255 --> 03:07:48,863
Rebecca on Wednesday but this is Ben

3276
03:07:49,119 --> 03:07:53,471
Deposition

3277
03:07:53,727 --> 03:07:59,871
But until then we have a website

3278
03:08:00,127 --> 03:08:05,503
Fight night go to bed

3279
03:08:05,759 --> 03:08:06,271
You got to wherever

Dzx Clark

I am the juiciest Ice Cube

3285
03:08:21,631 --> 03:08:25,215
Alex
