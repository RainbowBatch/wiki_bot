00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:20,992
Damn important I sweat it

2
00:00:21,248 --> 00:00:27,392

Jordan Jordan

8
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,144
Have you ever fought

9
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:10,912
Fulfilled

10
00:01:11,168 --> 00:01:11,680
Childhood

11
00:01:12,448 --> 00:01:18,592
Grow up little do you know

12
00:01:18,848 --> 00:01:22,176
I want to talk about Alex Jones

13
00:01:22,432 --> 00:01:27,296
Little did you know I was a wee nine-year-old boy in Honolulu

14
00:01:27,808 --> 00:01:33,952
Of years old when I first started Broadcasting

15
00:01:34,208 --> 00:01:36,256
I got an update about it and

16
00:01:36,512 --> 00:01:42,656
I don't know 25 years from now I'm going to have to take care of this

17
00:01:45,728 --> 00:01:49,568
I started listening to the final Edition or whatever the f*** is

18
00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:52,384
You know what no one's going to

19
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,152
Address

20
00:01:53,664 --> 00:01:57,504
This is going to be

21
00:01:59,808 --> 00:02:03,136
No I don't know I don't like

22
00:02:03,392 --> 00:02:04,416
Full fillable childhood

23
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:08,256
Flying

24
00:02:08,512 --> 00:02:13,376
You have playing at parasailing

25
00:02:15,168 --> 00:02:15,936
I've jumped off a cliff

26
00:02:21,056 --> 00:02:22,336
I've never jumped I'm terrified

27
00:02:22,592 --> 00:02:23,360
I would never jump

28
00:02:23,872 --> 00:02:28,736
It's not something that I probably would do again

29
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,344
Stanford

30
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:36,416
A bunch of people go off already

31
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:37,440
And

32
00:02:37,696 --> 00:02:40,256
Odds of me getting hurt are Slim

33
00:02:41,024 --> 00:02:42,560
You could see the water

34
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,352
Crocs

35
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:45,376
Butts

36
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:46,656
I would probably wouldn't do it again

37
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:48,960
Especially a contact

38
00:02:49,728 --> 00:02:50,240
Fuel

39
00:02:50,496 --> 00:02:51,008
Like

40
00:02:53,056 --> 00:02:54,336
Are people who do that are crazy

41
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:59,968
If I guess where I am actively fulfilling my child

42
00:03:04,064 --> 00:03:05,856
Radio

43
00:03:06,112 --> 00:03:07,648
Right that's what I was

44
00:03:07,904 --> 00:03:09,440
That's one of the things I was thinking

45
00:03:09,952 --> 00:03:10,464
Thinking about the question

46
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:13,280
Beaches

47
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:14,816
Adjacent to a dream

48
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:16,352
Cuz we've talked in the past

49
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:17,376
How you've always wanted

50
00:03:17,632 --> 00:03:19,168
Radio

51
00:03:19,424 --> 00:03:20,192
I've done a lot of things

52
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:20,960
Things that are at Jays

53
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:22,752
Goals that I've had

54
00:03:23,264 --> 00:03:25,056
Comedy is a kid but I don't know if there's a

55
00:03:25,312 --> 00:03:25,824
Any like

56
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:26,592
The only one

57
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:27,872
Genuinely

58
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:30,176
Had some

59
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:31,712
6 years old

60
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:32,736
Is writing

61
00:03:34,016 --> 00:03:36,064
I like that's the only childhood dream that I'm

62
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,344
I'm close to achieving

63
00:03:37,856 --> 00:03:38,368
I'm really

64
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:42,976
Or just that means a reason not to do

65
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:47,072
Absolutely.

66
00:03:47,328 --> 00:03:49,632
But I do know a lot about Alex

67
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:51,424
But I don't know

68
00:03:51,936 --> 00:03:55,520
Podcast

69
00:03:57,312 --> 00:03:58,592

The day before the Boston Bomber

75
00:04:12,672 --> 00:04:15,232
So weird

76
00:04:15,744 --> 00:04:17,024

77
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:17,791
Incredibly busy

78
00:04:19,583 --> 00:04:23,679

I want is a kind of wanted

101
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:49,183
Background of the present

102
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:52,255
Because the Eddie Bravo and we're still in

103
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:54,559
Studio on Friday

104
00:05:54,815 --> 00:05:57,631
They were on the war room with Owen Shroyer

105
00:05:57,887 --> 00:06:01,471
Eddie Bravo contact

106
00:06:02,495 --> 00:06:05,311

00:06:05,823 --> 00:06:09,919
Waiting for worship all over that the network

00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:14,015
Everybody

00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:15,295
To hear some Eddie Bravo.

110
00:06:15,551 --> 00:06:17,855
Severe backlash

111
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:18,623
From our audience

112
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:25,023
Unexpected and Universal sentiment

113
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:29,631
Don't cover the sky anymore it was awful

114
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:32,959
From the present day

115
00:06:33,983 --> 00:06:34,495
Get back into

116
00:06:34,751 --> 00:06:35,775
The past year 2013

117
00:06:36,543 --> 00:06:37,055
Let's do it

118
00:06:39,103 --> 00:06:39,615
From April 11th

119
00:06:39,871 --> 00:06:40,639
Alex make

120
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:44,223
You get a glimpse into how his brain works

121
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:45,759
And how he experiences

122
00:06:46,015 --> 00:06:46,527
Has his own

123
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:47,551
Situation

124
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:48,831
This is just

125
00:06:49,087 --> 00:06:50,111
The real bulshit

126
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:52,927
And this program is

127
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:11,103
When accelerated timetable

128
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:14,175
Several reasons behind

129
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:16,735
What are projections

130
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:21,855
Their operations sale

131
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:35,679
Corporate reservation

132
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:41,055
Beat

133
00:07:41,311 --> 00:07:44,895
Bert was talking about

134
00:07:45,151 --> 00:07:45,663
Present

135
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:46,943
The globalist

136
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:48,479
Who created like Iceland

137
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:52,831
Is like a placement immigrant

138
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:59,487
I don't know what he's talking about but also evidence

139
00:07:59,743 --> 00:08:02,815
Yeah so proven so on record is just ludicrous

140
00:08:03,327 --> 00:08:04,351
I am a big fan

141
00:08:09,215 --> 00:08:10,495
Suddenly somehow

142
00:08:11,007 --> 00:08:11,519
10 years Bhai

143
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:14,591
We have not sent we have not talked about this

144
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:15,359
Yesterday

145
00:08:15,615 --> 00:08:18,175
Or the day before that

146
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:19,455
That they are behind

147
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:29,183
Behind them too

148
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:33,023
Alex still says in the president after 10 years behind

149
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:36,095
Because the paper a push back on them

150
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:42,751
Grounded coming up the works

151
00:08:43,007 --> 00:08:43,519
Because they look

152
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:44,543
Their projections

153
00:08:47,871 --> 00:08:49,407
Yeah I think

154
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:52,479
He's twisting comments people have made about like

155
00:08:53,247 --> 00:08:54,015
High-Speed Rail

156
00:08:54,527 --> 00:08:56,319
Sure like that

157
00:08:56,575 --> 00:09:02,719
Cable monorail is modernization

158
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:06,815
Countries

159
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:07,839
Behind

160
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:08,607
People had hope

161
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:10,655
Alex

162
00:09:10,911 --> 00:09:11,423
Real

163
00:09:11,935 --> 00:09:12,959
EZ's consist

164
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:15,775
Keeps pushing forward on this

165
00:09:16,031 --> 00:09:17,055
Mentality

166
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:20,639
They're accelerating we should be accelerating

167
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:23,967
2

168
00:09:24,223 --> 00:09:24,991
And you're just creating

169
00:09:25,247 --> 00:09:27,551
The perception that they are what you're doing is

170
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:30,367
Justifying and rationalizing your own acceleration

171
00:09:31,135 --> 00:09:32,415
And that's kind of all the sky

172
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:37,023
Kind of like

173
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:40,863
We've got ten years behind on killing all of us

174
00:09:41,119 --> 00:09:42,143
So we

175
00:09:42,655 --> 00:09:43,167
Physically got tenure

176
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:43,935
Years to kill all

177
00:09:44,703 --> 00:09:45,727
That's really what I'm say

178
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:46,495
Or else

179
00:09:46,751 --> 00:09:48,287
Or else what

180
00:09:50,591 --> 00:09:51,615
They would already

181
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:52,639
Have killed you said

182
00:09:52,895 --> 00:09:54,687
Basically

183
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:56,735
So Alex

184
00:09:56,991 --> 00:09:59,295
Keeping that sort of vibe alive

185
00:10:01,855 --> 00:10:02,367
Fatal

186
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:03,647
Situation

187
00:10:05,183 --> 00:10:05,951
News report

188
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:06,719
Getaway today

189
00:10:06,975 --> 00:10:08,255
Hank is a little over-the-top

190
00:10:16,191 --> 00:10:19,263
Chilling information that we

191
00:10:19,775 --> 00:10:21,567
Broadcast

192
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:24,383
Publicly available

193
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:30,271
So the most chilling information ever of all time

194
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:31,039
Every time he

195
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:37,951
We got the hammer tonight

196
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:39,743
Guess we've ever had it

197
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:40,511
The guy who hit

198
00:10:42,303 --> 00:10:44,607
A pretty fun interview

199
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:49,983
Alex's guest

200
00:10:50,239 --> 00:10:55,871
That guy was pretty fun he paid his rent cameras

201
00:10:57,919 --> 00:11:03,551
We can spend all day trying to guess what this

202
00:11:04,575 --> 00:11:10,719
Infowars.com

203
00:11:10,975 --> 00:11:11,487
President

204
00:11:11,743 --> 00:11:13,535
Italian Supreme Court

205
00:11:21,215 --> 00:11:25,567
Has now come out and said that the government has all the documentation

206
00:11:33,503 --> 00:11:36,319
Terror attacks are

207
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:42,975
Documents

208
00:11:43,487 --> 00:11:47,071
So what's going on here is Alex's saying that this is in the present

209
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:53,727
Like that this guy is a document that shows that the Bilderberg Group whenever people metal in

210
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:55,519
Globalist plans or whatever

211
00:11:56,031 --> 00:12:00,895
And that's not really fair but that's the presentation he is absolutely trying

212
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:02,687
To create

213
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:09,343
Ferdinando I

214
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:10,367
Italian soup

215
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:13,951
Is often credited

216
00:12:14,207 --> 00:12:15,999
Of the Supreme Court

217
00:12:16,255 --> 00:12:22,143
But I can't find any evidence of an actual judge I honestly have no idea what that title

218
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:25,727
And I've looked into it a little bit and I still don't really understand

219
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:30,079
From what I can tell the front like looking at Italian School website

220
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:32,895
Honorary judges are sometimes the point

221
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:34,943
Courts on various matters

222
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:36,479
What is usually a temporary

223
00:12:36,991 --> 00:12:37,759
Depending on the person

224
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:40,063
So he might have a sister

225
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:42,367
Did the Civil Supreme Court

226
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:45,183
On subjugated honorary

227
00:12:45,439 --> 00:12:46,207
Judge Consulting

228
00:12:46,719 --> 00:12:52,863
Yeah it. He's a legitimate person who's had a career in public service

229
00:12:55,679 --> 00:13:00,543
I don't think honorary president of the Italian Supreme Court is a bulshit credential

230
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:04,895
The way Alex is presenting it is a little bit

231
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:06,687
It's not as though

232
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:10,783
Chief Supreme Court judge

233
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:11,807
Roberts

234
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:15,135
Steve pieczenik working at

235
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:20,511
Sure have enough information

236
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:22,303
Whether or not this guy is lying

237
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:25,631
About his involvement

238
00:13:25,887 --> 00:13:26,399
Is framing at Asda

239
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:27,423
Gotcha

240
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:33,567
18 mm possemato published a book called The Republic of unpunished Mass

241
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:34,335
Checkers

242
00:13:34,591 --> 00:13:36,383
Which sounds better in

243
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:38,175
In the book

244
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:44,063
He claims that he found a document to prove that the Bilderberg Group was behind terrorist attacks in Italy in the seventies and eighties

245
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:48,671
Nor has imposimato even claim Tucson

246
00:13:48,927 --> 00:13:49,951
Authenticated it

247
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:51,999
He just believes it to be genuine

248
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:54,559
Wow I mean that's

249
00:13:54,815 --> 00:13:55,327
Hello bar

250
00:13:56,863 --> 00:13:57,375
Simpler ice

251
00:13:57,631 --> 00:14:01,983
Sure Alex himself has the document

252
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:07,359
And it proves that whatever Italy and the present day

253
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:09,151
They did it with folks like terrorist attack

254
00:14:09,407 --> 00:14:11,711
Which is ludicrous even if you believe all the authors

255
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:12,479
Being baited

256
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:20,415
He was only talking about activity that took place in the days of operation gladio which

257
00:14:20,671 --> 00:14:21,695
Continue to the present day

258
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:23,743
It was a product of Cold War stupidity

259
00:14:24,255 --> 00:14:27,583
And by the time anything related to involved actual attack

260
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:29,119
It was because of groups that it

261
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:30,655
It's splintered from their original purpose

262
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:31,423
Gone Rogue

263
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:35,263
Now is that in itself a good argument against

264
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:36,287
Gladio

265
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:38,335
You bet

266
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:43,711
Does it prove that the people behind glad you're actually trying to create Terror cells blowout false flag attack

267
00:14:44,479 --> 00:14:45,759
I think I need more evidence.

268
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:47,807
Ankeny Bark Avenue

269
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:49,343
Before we going to be able to

270
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:50,623
Substantiate that one

271
00:14:51,135 --> 00:14:57,279
That's claiming to be actual evidence that the Bilderberg Group was involved in operation gladio outside

272
00:14:57,791 --> 00:15:00,351
Mysterious document that deposit auto claim to Sabah.

273
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:01,119
Anywhere to be

274
00:15:01,887 --> 00:15:04,447
The most chilling

275
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:05,727
News in the world

276
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:09,055
Okay so the most chilling news in the world it is

277
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:10,335
For a while

278
00:15:11,103 --> 00:15:11,871
Maybe

279
00:15:13,151 --> 00:15:13,663
Probably not

280
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:18,015
Right

281
00:15:21,343 --> 00:15:21,855
No

282
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:23,391
I'm pretty fine with

283
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:24,415
I wasn't even born

284
00:15:25,951 --> 00:15:27,999
What about

285
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:29,791
Alex to change the narrative

286
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:33,631
He's still

287
00:15:34,143 --> 00:15:34,655
Kind of

288
00:15:35,423 --> 00:15:36,703
They're beating the drums

289
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:38,239
Of attacking them

290
00:15:38,495 --> 00:15:42,847
Use that you still saying that like they're going to attack or threatening to attack.

291
00:15:43,103 --> 00:15:43,871
Japan and what-have-you

292
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:46,943
But now he is put a slight twist in it

293
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:48,479
And that is that the globalist

294
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:50,015
Are paying him

295
00:15:50,271 --> 00:15:51,039
Kim Jeong Hoon

296
00:15:51,295 --> 00:15:55,135
To threaten people in order to create this strategic tension

297
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:56,415
As a related

298
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:57,439
To this this

299
00:15:57,695 --> 00:15:58,719
Italian Supreme Court guy

300
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:05,631
Sure I am chill. Nothing other than assumption

301
00:16:05,887 --> 00:16:11,007
Send like this is how I read the tea leaves perhaps

302
00:16:11,263 --> 00:16:11,775
Perhaps

303
00:16:12,031 --> 00:16:13,823
11th is kind of a ghost town

304
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:15,103
In terms of anything in

305
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:18,175
Continuation of all the same

306
00:16:18,431 --> 00:16:21,759
Gun paranoia they're coming to take your kids

307
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:24,063
Trends continue

308
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:24,831
It's kind of

309
00:16:25,087 --> 00:16:25,599
Boring to keep

310
00:16:25,855 --> 00:16:26,623
Keep going over it

311
00:16:27,391 --> 00:16:27,903
Ghost town is

312
00:16:30,207 --> 00:16:31,743
Dino lacoco's

313
00:16:38,655 --> 00:16:40,959
I think he's trying to overblow

314
00:16:41,215 --> 00:16:41,727
His own

315
00:16:41,983 --> 00:16:42,751
Important

316
00:16:43,263 --> 00:16:44,031
Impactfulness

317
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:47,615
Alex yeah I know it very odd character

318
00:16:47,871 --> 00:16:50,687
But in doing so I think he accidentally said some

319
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:52,223
Quite true

320
00:17:00,415 --> 00:17:04,767
Talking about right now

321
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:10,655
Jellyfish

322
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:20,895
Your ancestors

323
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:24,479
Of course through your spirit

324
00:17:31,391 --> 00:17:35,487
Problem on their hands

325
00:17:38,303 --> 00:17:40,095
You know even jellyfish listening

326
00:17:40,351 --> 00:17:41,887
Are going to be

327
00:17:42,143 --> 00:17:44,191
Pull up defenses because of Alex

328
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:51,615
I think if you passively don't believe him

329
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:53,407
If you actively don't believe him

330
00:17:53,663 --> 00:17:54,175
Doesn't have much of a

331
00:17:54,687 --> 00:17:57,247
If you're just casually listening to him

332
00:17:57,503 --> 00:17:59,551
He is going to have an effect on you

333
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:02,111
But he's recognizing and and

334
00:18:02,367 --> 00:18:02,879
Sort of

335
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:04,927
Pointing to the fact that like

336
00:18:05,183 --> 00:18:07,231
What is it positive

337
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:09,791
Even if you don't believe me

338
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:11,839
This is going to f*** with your subconscious

339
00:18:12,095 --> 00:18:14,911
What are the reason

340
00:18:15,167 --> 00:18:17,983
His style of broadcast particular

341
00:18:18,495 --> 00:18:20,031
Right

342
00:18:20,287 --> 00:18:21,311
Really trying to

343
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:22,847
It lets you ignore it

344
00:18:23,103 --> 00:18:26,943
As a whole or you come in with us

345
00:18:27,199 --> 00:18:28,735
Guard up

346
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:30,015
It can be very dangerous

347
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:31,807
He's like a

348
00:18:34,623 --> 00:18:35,391
I think so much

349
00:18:35,647 --> 00:18:36,159
About

350
00:18:38,719 --> 00:18:40,511
Update iOS

351
00:18:41,023 --> 00:18:41,791
211

352
00:18:42,047 --> 00:18:42,559
7.1

353
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:43,583
02

354
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:44,863
Because hackers

355
00:18:46,143 --> 00:18:47,167
And there's this one little thing

356
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:47,935
I don't want you

357
00:18:48,191 --> 00:18:50,751
Fix it it's all closed

358
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:52,287
Possibly walking by

359
00:18:52,543 --> 00:18:53,311
And you have an update

360
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:54,079
Then out

361
00:18:55,103 --> 00:18:55,615
Begin

362
00:18:56,383 --> 00:19:01,503
Ocean hijacking

363
00:19:02,783 --> 00:19:05,343
Find it possible that he's not aware of that like

364
00:19:05,855 --> 00:19:09,183
He's perfectly describing it here just in heroic language

365
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:11,999
I think it makes them all the worse

366
00:19:12,767 --> 00:19:14,303
Also on this episode

367
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:15,327
Who's got a real

368
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:16,607
Bee in his bonnet

369
00:19:16,863 --> 00:19:18,143
About how everyone's ripping him off

370
00:19:20,191 --> 00:19:21,215
That's cool how many times

371
00:19:22,239 --> 00:19:23,263
Stolen people's ideas

372
00:19:23,519 --> 00:19:24,031
Put him on a shirt

373
00:19:24,287 --> 00:19:30,431
The more presents

374
00:19:30,687 --> 00:19:31,711
1776

375
00:19:32,223 --> 00:19:34,783
Makai

376
00:19:35,295 --> 00:19:36,063
But

377
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:39,647
Complaining about Glenn Beck

378
00:19:42,207 --> 00:19:44,767
Goodnight to everybody

379
00:19:45,023 --> 00:19:46,047
Are ripping them off

380
00:19:46,303 --> 00:19:50,655
And I can actually explain that I also fail to believe

381
00:19:51,167 --> 00:19:52,703
I refuse to believe

382
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:54,751
But he's not aware of what's really going on

383
00:19:55,519 --> 00:19:59,871
Add

384
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:06,271
Rush Limbaugh

385
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:17,791
You know what's going on

386
00:20:18,303 --> 00:20:22,655
What all of them were reading Drudge

387
00:20:27,775 --> 00:20:29,055
You know I

388
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:30,335
I think

389
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:32,639
I don't know if he's

390
00:20:32,895 --> 00:20:33,407
Expressing this

391
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:35,199
But nothing

392
00:20:35,455 --> 00:20:36,479
He says where he says within

393
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:38,527
That makes me

394
00:20:38,783 --> 00:20:39,295
I think that

395
00:20:40,575 --> 00:20:41,087
Bless

396
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:44,415
Like they're just all reading the same I mean they were all

397
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:51,327
Laundry like Alex has something fun

398
00:20:51,839 --> 00:20:55,167
Right

399
00:20:55,423 --> 00:20:55,935
Is like

400
00:20:56,191 --> 00:20:57,983
Distill this down to something that we can act

401
00:21:00,031 --> 00:21:00,543
Right

402
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:05,407
Right is that is definitely process

403
00:21:05,663 --> 00:21:10,527
Crazyshit and because he runs this Infowars website

404
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:13,599
He has articles that end up getting linked on drugs

405
00:21:14,111 --> 00:21:19,744
Do a couple of days after he started yelling about that he read on drugs

406
00:21:21,024 --> 00:21:24,096
Story will be on the right-wing media

407
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:24,864
Spirits

408
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,704
Whatever the case is all roads lead back to drive

409
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,520
That's the reason that Alex feels like everyone

410
00:21:31,776 --> 00:21:34,080
That's just because you all have the same news source

411
00:21:34,592 --> 00:21:37,152
You rely on for your careers

412
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:42,016
Bring up a buyer report a lot

413
00:21:42,272 --> 00:21:43,552
Is this

414
00:21:43,808 --> 00:21:45,600
Episode

415
00:21:45,856 --> 00:21:48,928
Take our guns

416
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:51,232
Exhaust

417
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:29,632
Alex is lying

418
00:22:29,888 --> 00:22:32,960
So hard I've listened to song

419
00:22:33,216 --> 00:22:38,592
I've listened to so many of the shows and almost without fail callers do not confirmed

420
00:22:39,616 --> 00:22:42,944
Bill generally try and be polite like we talked about

421
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,992
Veterans getting that letter f

422
00:22:46,272 --> 00:22:46,784
I'm pretty sure my

423
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:53,184
Classica I haven't checked the mail today

424
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:58,048
We'll take that as confirmation of something that is absolutely not the case

425
00:22:58,560 --> 00:22:59,584
IC

426
00:23:00,096 --> 00:23:01,376
Very low rate

427
00:23:01,888 --> 00:23:03,168
Galaxy colors

428
00:23:03,936 --> 00:23:05,728
Offering anything substantial

429
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:07,520
To confirm

430
00:23:08,032 --> 00:23:09,568
That seems to be pretty rare

431
00:23:10,336 --> 00:23:11,360
So you getting really exist

432
00:23:11,616 --> 00:23:13,408
There's a

433
00:23:13,664 --> 00:23:15,456
Dick taking the guns taking the kids

434
00:23:15,712 --> 00:23:18,784
Globalist want to take over all this s***

435
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:21,856
I'll bet there's a real singular focus on

436
00:23:22,112 --> 00:23:22,624
Thomas episode

437
00:23:23,136 --> 00:23:24,160
Regarding

438
00:23:24,928 --> 00:23:25,952
Dumbing people down

439
00:23:27,744 --> 00:23:28,768
Something that is very interest

440
00:23:29,024 --> 00:23:29,536
Sit in on this

441
00:23:29,792 --> 00:23:30,304
He's

442
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:33,120
For Oregon music yet

443
00:23:33,376 --> 00:23:35,424
But his career with

444
00:23:36,704 --> 00:23:39,008
Yeah and this clip where he's talking about it

445
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:45,664
Plan I suppose is at the globalist want to dumb people they can't fight back

446
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:47,200
These Invasion plan

447
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:52,832
Because

448
00:23:53,856 --> 00:23:55,136
He provides for this

449
00:23:55,648 --> 00:23:56,160
Is that

450
00:23:58,464 --> 00:23:59,744
We're entering a.

451
00:24:02,304 --> 00:24:04,864
Downhill

452
00:24:28,416 --> 00:24:34,560
So Alex is figured that there's enough dumb people

453
00:24:34,816 --> 00:24:40,448
Provides no video that shows that people are dumb

454
00:24:41,216 --> 00:24:41,728
I think

455
00:24:41,984 --> 00:24:42,496
I think that

456
00:24:43,264 --> 00:24:43,776
What he think

457
00:24:44,032 --> 00:24:45,056
Is going on

458
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:46,080
Is Mark Dice

459
00:24:46,848 --> 00:24:48,128
Imitating what the

460
00:24:48,384 --> 00:24:48,896
The globalist

461
00:24:49,152 --> 00:24:49,664
Actuaries

462
00:24:50,688 --> 00:24:51,968
So the globalist

463
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,784
Getting people to sign those petitions they're like

464
00:24:55,296 --> 00:24:57,600
We know now we've got 100,000 signatures

465
00:24:57,856 --> 00:24:59,136
And Mark

466
00:24:59,392 --> 00:25:00,928
Proves that the globalists are doing

467
00:25:04,512 --> 00:25:10,656
No no no no. This is a prank video

468
00:25:11,936 --> 00:25:15,264
This is the Flop elevated man on the street video

469
00:25:17,568 --> 00:25:18,080
Music

470
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,152
Approved

471
00:25:21,664 --> 00:25:23,968
What a f****** a******

472
00:25:24,224 --> 00:25:25,760
On this episode

473
00:25:26,016 --> 00:25:29,088
He is going on and on about how these are great

474
00:25:29,856 --> 00:25:32,416
Demonstrate these grapes

475
00:25:32,672 --> 00:25:34,208
Lee Ann McAdoo has been hired

476
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:40,352
I think this might be one of the first first

477
00:25:40,608 --> 00:25:44,448
Instances of Alex bring up Lee Ann McAdoo has been hired and

478
00:25:44,704 --> 00:25:45,728
She goes out on the street

479
00:25:47,264 --> 00:25:49,312
Ask people to sign the petition Banning

480
00:25:49,568 --> 00:25:53,920
Dihydrogen monoxide

481
00:26:08,512 --> 00:26:10,304
A real interest of his

482
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:13,376
On this April 12th

483
00:26:13,632 --> 00:26:15,424
It's it's not following a trend

484
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,288
For the prior week Survivor

485
00:26:20,544 --> 00:26:21,056
Just can't

486
00:26:21,312 --> 00:26:21,824
Send anybody that

487
00:26:22,592 --> 00:26:23,104
Any of those

488
00:26:23,872 --> 00:26:24,384
For anything

489
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,408
Other than the

490
00:26:25,664 --> 00:26:26,176
Individual

491
00:26:27,968 --> 00:26:30,016
Because you're

492
00:26:30,528 --> 00:26:31,296
Give me a steady

493
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,088
Have you out there

494
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,624
4 hours

495
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:37,696
99 Savage

496
00:26:37,952 --> 00:26:38,464
F*** you

497
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:45,888
Undercut are clearly just like

498
00:26:46,144 --> 00:26:49,984
We all signed at 3

499
00:26:53,056 --> 00:26:53,568
Anytime that's

500
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:54,592
Extrapolate

501
00:26:55,104 --> 00:26:56,128
Real people are like

502
00:26:56,896 --> 00:26:58,432
The majority from those video

503
00:26:59,456 --> 00:27:00,992
Right right so if you want

504
00:27:01,248 --> 00:27:01,760
This argument

505
00:27:02,016 --> 00:27:07,648
He needs to show the other stuff the globalist actuaries and what-have-you

506
00:27:07,904 --> 00:27:10,208
Mark Dice

507
00:27:10,464 --> 00:27:11,744
Better than that

508
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:17,120
That's something that only would be convincing to a dumptown audience

509
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:19,680
Probably

510
00:27:19,936 --> 00:27:20,704
Odd

511
00:27:21,216 --> 00:27:24,032
So are the Democrats

512
00:27:24,288 --> 00:27:27,616
Apparently

513
00:27:28,128 --> 00:27:28,640
Great job

514
00:27:28,896 --> 00:27:31,200
Focusing on that I sure

515
00:27:31,456 --> 00:27:33,248
Interesting for that

516
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:35,808
Standard stuff

517
00:27:39,136 --> 00:27:39,648
To keep track of

518
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:43,488
We are not we are not

519
00:27:59,104 --> 00:28:03,456
Robert's Rules parliamentary procedure

520
00:28:03,712 --> 00:28:05,760
OK Google

521
00:28:10,368 --> 00:28:11,392
Larry Harmon

522
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:12,928
Hey

523
00:28:13,184 --> 00:28:14,720
Either way

524
00:28:19,584 --> 00:28:25,728
Audience would believe

525
00:28:27,776 --> 00:28:33,920
I understand that you love Ron Paul and his brothers got to be cool by association or maybe even Ron Paul told him to

526
00:28:36,224 --> 00:28:37,248
Like this is not

527
00:28:37,504 --> 00:28:40,576
Something that's acceptable for you to be someone

528
00:28:40,832 --> 00:28:42,624
Epsom salt

529
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:44,160
And actually believe that

530
00:28:44,416 --> 00:28:46,208
Like this this is recorded

531
00:28:46,464 --> 00:28:48,000
This is very easy to

532
00:28:48,256 --> 00:28:49,024
Show to be false

533
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:51,328
I have an even greater

534
00:28:52,096 --> 00:28:55,680
WhatsApp follow Robert's Rules

535
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:04,384
I didn't know that

536
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:05,920
Search

537
00:29:10,784 --> 00:29:12,832
Over the course of the time doing this podcast

538
00:29:13,088 --> 00:29:13,856
I think we have

539
00:29:14,112 --> 00:29:14,880
Seeing Alex

540
00:29:15,392 --> 00:29:16,416
Pretty hurtful to

541
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:17,184
A lot of group

542
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:21,792
Groups of people minorities women

543
00:29:22,048 --> 00:29:27,680
I've never heard him be shity to this specific group

544
00:29:27,936 --> 00:29:31,520
Alex is almost devoid of

545
00:29:32,032 --> 00:29:35,360
Being the same kind of assholes used to everybody about folks

546
00:29:35,616 --> 00:29:36,128
Disability

547
00:29:38,688 --> 00:29:40,992
It shouldn't surprise me but it's

548
00:29:41,248 --> 00:29:41,760
Kind of

549
00:29:43,552 --> 00:29:44,064
Weird

550
00:29:49,696 --> 00:29:50,464
With certain

551
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:52,768
Rice

552
00:29:53,536 --> 00:29:54,048
Unbelievable

553
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:56,096
Brights

554
00:30:18,112 --> 00:30:18,624
What

555
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,952
Crazy

556
00:30:25,792 --> 00:30:31,936
Party because I think I know what that means right

557
00:30:32,192 --> 00:30:38,336
Nothing is the everybody has endowed with some gifts

558
00:30:38,592 --> 00:30:40,384
Disability

559
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:43,968
Are there a hard time for you

560
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:48,832
I swear I'm running a horrible

561
00:30:49,856 --> 00:30:51,648
Everyone is given gif

562
00:30:51,904 --> 00:30:52,416
Great

563
00:30:52,928 --> 00:30:54,976
And the gift given to the handicapped

564
00:30:56,256 --> 00:30:58,816
Is the knowledge that they are making someone else

565
00:30:59,072 --> 00:31:03,680
Supplyforce which is a growth opportunity airborne

566
00:31:03,936 --> 00:31:06,752
They are things

567
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:09,056
Everyone giving gifts

568
00:31:09,568 --> 00:31:12,128
Wow

569
00:31:12,384 --> 00:31:14,944
But they don't know

570
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,224
I don't know

571
00:31:19,040 --> 00:31:19,808
Insane that's it

572
00:31:20,064 --> 00:31:21,600
Next level

573
00:31:21,856 --> 00:31:24,160
Yeah it's treating people who I happened

574
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:26,464
To have some disability status

575
00:31:29,024 --> 00:31:29,536
There

576
00:31:29,792 --> 00:31:32,096
As a as a side quest

577
00:31:32,352 --> 00:31:35,424
Or whatever it's yours

578
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:36,192
To you

579
00:31:37,728 --> 00:31:38,240
Handicap

580
00:31:38,752 --> 00:31:40,544
Being emotional barbell

581
00:31:41,056 --> 00:31:42,336
For other people to work

582
00:31:42,848 --> 00:31:43,616
Yep that's it

583
00:31:43,872 --> 00:31:46,432
Good guess that's shity

584
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,760
Episode

585
00:31:50,016 --> 00:31:51,040
Guy by the name of benzos

586
00:31:53,088 --> 00:31:55,392
And that one of the reasons is that

587
00:31:55,648 --> 00:31:56,160
Is leaving

588
00:31:56,672 --> 00:31:59,232
Hi Fox affiliate works at I believe in Alex

589
00:31:59,744 --> 00:32:00,768
And try to make a real sucker

590
00:32:04,352 --> 00:32:05,632
Because he's libertarian

591
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,240
So obviously the globalist

592
00:32:10,496 --> 00:32:11,008
They're forcing him out of

593
00:32:11,264 --> 00:32:11,776
PlayStation

594
00:32:12,032 --> 00:32:13,312
So I assume he

595
00:32:15,616 --> 00:32:21,760
No no no no

596
00:32:22,016 --> 00:32:25,088
Isn't this point I don't think it's anything nefarious

597
00:32:25,344 --> 00:32:26,880
Explain

598
00:32:28,672 --> 00:32:32,000
I think it is probably think

599
00:32:32,256 --> 00:32:35,072
8fit floor online media

600
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:37,888
I think it

601
00:32:38,144 --> 00:32:38,912
Perfectly Plaza

602
00:32:39,168 --> 00:32:40,448
Later

603
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:44,288
Maybe not

604
00:32:46,592 --> 00:32:49,152
Here like

605
00:32:52,992 --> 00:32:58,624
Alex wants to be the narrative because that's the narrative Alex has about himself in his early days of radio

606
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,928
Shut up about the clintons

607
00:33:02,208 --> 00:33:03,488
And that's why you got fired from

608
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,304
KLBJ or kjfk whichever one

609
00:33:06,816 --> 00:33:07,328
Can rubber

610
00:33:07,584 --> 00:33:10,144
You wanted to be a mirror of his

611
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:11,936
So he can yell about his own

612
00:33:12,192 --> 00:33:13,472
That's basically what goes on

613
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:17,568
So Alex

614
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,360
Discredit

615
00:33:21,664 --> 00:33:22,944
You learn something

616
00:33:44,192 --> 00:33:48,800
Did you know that there are at least five different awards called the Edward armor award

617
00:33:49,056 --> 00:33:50,080
Now that's what I was

618
00:33:51,616 --> 00:33:56,992
And it does get better than that and it's called the Pulitzer

619
00:33:57,248 --> 00:34:03,392
That's one of them

620
00:34:03,648 --> 00:34:05,696
Like s*** or whatever do I get time

621
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,120
Digital news Association

622
00:34:14,912 --> 00:34:15,936
2000

623
00:34:16,704 --> 00:34:20,032
This was for quote continuing coverage about Alexandra Flores

624
00:34:20,288 --> 00:34:22,592
Who was a five-year-old girl have been abducted

625
00:34:22,848 --> 00:34:23,616
And eventually murder

626
00:34:23,872 --> 00:34:24,896
So their news coverage

627
00:34:25,152 --> 00:34:26,176
About that story

628
00:34:26,432 --> 00:34:27,968
I was what ended up winning them

629
00:34:28,224 --> 00:34:28,736
The art

630
00:34:30,784 --> 00:34:36,928
The thing is though is website awards at that swans name

631
00:34:37,184 --> 00:34:37,952
Is there anywhere on it

632
00:34:38,464 --> 00:34:44,352
That's because the continuing coverage Ward is not given to an individual but instead of to a station

633
00:34:44,608 --> 00:34:45,120
In this case

634
00:34:45,376 --> 00:34:46,144
KFOX

635
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:47,168
TV El Paso

636
00:34:47,936 --> 00:34:54,080
This version of the Edward armor award the one that's giving out by The Archies

637
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:55,104
2 station

638
00:34:55,616 --> 00:34:56,640
Reflecting a recognition

639
00:34:56,896 --> 00:34:57,920
The collaborative effort

640
00:34:58,176 --> 00:34:59,968
The go into creating a complete news broke

641
00:35:00,224 --> 00:35:01,248
So what you're saying is he

642
00:35:01,504 --> 00:35:02,784
T1d Edward armor

643
00:35:03,296 --> 00:35:04,064
Inocencia

644
00:35:07,648 --> 00:35:09,696
And I'm sure he worked on the coverage

645
00:35:09,952 --> 00:35:10,976
But I feel like saying that

646
00:35:11,232 --> 00:35:12,000
He won this award

647
00:35:12,256 --> 00:35:13,024
Dishonest framing

648
00:35:13,536 --> 00:35:17,376
More accurate way to say that like the station you worked at 1

649
00:35:17,632 --> 00:35:19,680
That doesn't sound good on a bayou

650
00:35:19,936 --> 00:35:21,472
I like Isaac that reminds

651
00:35:22,496 --> 00:35:23,008
Hannibal's

652
00:35:28,896 --> 00:35:29,920
I was just on the right

653
00:35:30,176 --> 00:35:30,688
Team with the right

654
00:35:30,944 --> 00:35:31,968
Time like I haven't

655
00:35:32,224 --> 00:35:33,504
The same way to Juan Howard has

656
00:35:34,272 --> 00:35:36,064
Okay

657
00:35:36,576 --> 00:35:40,928
I got you Alex doesn't know that there are multiple different Awards named after Edward amuro

658
00:35:41,184 --> 00:35:44,768
It's possible that by the corporation

659
00:35:45,024 --> 00:35:46,048
Public Broadcasting

660
00:35:46,304 --> 00:35:49,376
They don't even give them out some beer

661
00:35:53,216 --> 00:35:53,728
Observe

662
00:35:53,984 --> 00:36:00,128
Okay

663
00:36:00,384 --> 00:36:06,528
But you might notice something similar about those two people and that is that they working Public Broadcasting

664
00:36:06,784 --> 00:36:08,576
The public broadcaster

665
00:36:09,856 --> 00:36:12,928
There's also the Edward armor awards given out by Washington

666
00:36:13,184 --> 00:36:16,256
State University which is Everett Alvarez alma mater

667
00:36:16,512 --> 00:36:18,304
I bought a whole bunch of people that Alex

668
00:36:18,816 --> 00:36:23,936
Pics of one that broke off Helen Thomas Ted Koppel

669
00:36:24,192 --> 00:36:27,008
That one is basically the lifetime

670
00:36:27,264 --> 00:36:31,104
Lifetime Achievement Award you talking about

671
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:37,504
On that list are super relevant if you're imagining events 111

672
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:42,368
This is the problem with the words that have the same name as other Awards

673
00:36:42,624 --> 00:36:48,768
It's really easy to get the idea that Ben Swann is being honored in the same way that Walter Cronkite pay

674
00:36:49,024 --> 00:36:50,048
Is part of a team to put together

675
00:36:50,304 --> 00:36:54,144
Quality continuing coverage of local news about a kidnapped child

676
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:59,520
I'm not for that I think you should be super proud of the work is done

677
00:36:59,776 --> 00:37:05,920
I'm just saying I suspected this might be an attempt to willfully deceived people about the nature of this award or at least a willing

678
00:37:06,176 --> 00:37:08,736
Famous let other people make the assumption that they make

679
00:37:09,248 --> 00:37:10,272
Correct

680
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:13,856
If we gave out of scholarship

681
00:37:14,368 --> 00:37:14,880
And names

682
00:37:15,136 --> 00:37:16,160
The Fulbright

683
00:37:16,416 --> 00:37:16,928
Scholarship

684
00:37:17,184 --> 00:37:18,720
It would be a little bit

685
00:37:19,232 --> 00:37:20,256
Going to be like

686
00:37:20,512 --> 00:37:24,096
Yeah it would be

687
00:37:24,608 --> 00:37:30,752
I got you but you know I understand multiple Awards named after luminary

688
00:37:31,008 --> 00:37:31,776
Fielder

689
00:37:32,032 --> 00:37:33,056
TV news

690
00:37:33,312 --> 00:37:36,640
So also because of this I didn't cut a clip of it but Alex

691
00:37:37,152 --> 00:37:39,456
Feels the need to brag about his own accomplishments

692
00:37:40,224 --> 00:37:42,784
And so he says that a couple years back he won an award

693
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:43,808
From stalkers Maga

694
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,344
The top award

695
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:46,880
From stalkers magazine

696
00:37:47,648 --> 00:37:48,672
Aiden

697
00:37:52,512 --> 00:37:54,560
2011 Nubia seminar

698
00:37:55,072 --> 00:37:56,096
Guess who open forum

699
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:01,728
Dana Gould Lionel

700
00:38:01,984 --> 00:38:03,776
Yep

701
00:38:05,056 --> 00:38:09,408
2011 things looked a lot different with a lot different

702
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:13,248
So stalkers didn't even put out a list

703
00:38:13,504 --> 00:38:14,528
It's called The Heavy hundred

704
00:38:14,784 --> 00:38:16,064
Which is the top

705
00:38:16,576 --> 00:38:17,088
Radio

706
00:38:17,344 --> 00:38:17,856
Go figure

707
00:38:18,368 --> 00:38:20,416
Never been number one on that list

708
00:38:20,672 --> 00:38:21,952
Absolutely not

709
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:25,280
ID 2019 Alex's number 49

710
00:38:26,048 --> 00:38:26,560
That's not bad

711
00:38:27,072 --> 00:38:28,864
It's Not Butter

712
00:38:29,376 --> 00:38:33,728
Call Curtis and Juliet is number 36

713
00:38:33,984 --> 00:38:37,056
Okay well then they're doing great I have never heard of them ever

714
00:38:37,312 --> 00:38:42,176
And the picture was a younger blog

715
00:38:42,432 --> 00:38:46,272
So Alex is Thirteenth Floor on the lift FM

716
00:38:46,528 --> 00:38:47,808
Did you say red

717
00:38:48,064 --> 00:38:53,440
The Dude Looks real weird text Curtis

718
00:38:53,952 --> 00:38:56,256
To be fair though Alex

719
00:38:56,512 --> 00:38:58,816
Gorka

720
00:38:59,072 --> 00:39:03,168
Dorcas number 27

721
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:05,472
Absolutely

722
00:39:05,728 --> 00:39:11,104
Giving Nazis radio she was looking right

723
00:39:11,872 --> 00:39:12,896
Alright

724
00:39:13,152 --> 00:39:14,944
26 /

725
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,480
Last year 2017

726
00:39:18,016 --> 00:39:19,552
Heavy hundred list

727
00:39:19,808 --> 00:39:22,368
Bad sign about the State of Affairs for Alex's career

728
00:39:22,624 --> 00:39:23,904
That drop from 26

729
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:24,928
249 is a bay

730
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:25,952
Slide for him

731
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:29,536
Biggby makeup that list based on Consulting with a big group

732
00:39:29,792 --> 00:39:33,120
Radio industry figures

733
00:39:33,376 --> 00:39:34,400
How to ground to terms

734
00:39:34,656 --> 00:39:35,168
Is Radio imp

735
00:39:35,936 --> 00:39:37,984
The industry doesn't seem to see him as relevant

736
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:39,008
Is raiding the probably

737
00:39:39,264 --> 00:39:39,776
Plummeting

738
00:39:40,032 --> 00:39:43,360
It's not like they hate conservatives or people who are like Alex

739
00:39:43,616 --> 00:39:47,968
That list is mostly just right-wing talk show host

740
00:39:48,736 --> 00:39:49,760
Only right

741
00:39:51,808 --> 00:39:56,416
How much larger the number 14 the last

742
00:39:56,672 --> 00:40:00,512
2 years on it so it's not liberal bias

743
00:40:01,024 --> 00:40:02,304
Hey Glenn Beck is beat Alex ever

744
00:40:03,072 --> 00:40:03,840
I want to know who

745
00:40:04,864 --> 00:40:07,168
Brutal with that feel

746
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:10,752
I scroll through it and like once you get down into like

747
00:40:11,008 --> 00:40:12,032
The 70s and 80s

748
00:40:12,288 --> 00:40:13,312
It's kind of

749
00:40:13,568 --> 00:40:14,592
Real

750
00:40:15,104 --> 00:40:21,248
I don't know who any of these people are I didn't know this was a show

751
00:40:32,768 --> 00:40:33,280
Doesn't exist

752
00:40:34,304 --> 00:40:38,400
Just because I thought it was really lame

753
00:40:38,656 --> 00:40:39,424
His keynote speech

754
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:40,448
From stalkers

755
00:40:40,704 --> 00:40:42,240
The convention in 2011

756
00:40:42,496 --> 00:40:48,640
And it's f****** insane video

757
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:52,992
Well

758
00:40:53,248 --> 00:40:58,368
Every now and again you'll hear a voice in the crowd be like wow

759
00:40:59,904 --> 00:41:01,952
It's.

760
00:41:02,208 --> 00:41:08,352
Conference attendees about the globalist that's awful like a round of applause a couple tie

761
00:41:08,608 --> 00:41:10,144
One of them was like

762
00:41:10,912 --> 00:41:12,960
He's talking about how in his early days

763
00:41:13,216 --> 00:41:14,752
He had to edit video from taped

764
00:41:15,008 --> 00:41:16,288
To table to take forever

765
00:41:17,312 --> 00:41:22,432
3 night 3 hours of sleep a night for these years and he was coming up

766
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:28,832
Turn me into what I am today

767
00:41:29,088 --> 00:41:30,368
Feels like they're laughing

768
00:41:30,624 --> 00:41:35,232
Crazy knowledge

769
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,024
God I will I would

770
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:37,792
Do anything

771
00:41:38,304 --> 00:41:38,816
To have

772
00:41:39,328 --> 00:41:39,840
To go back in time

773
00:41:43,168 --> 00:41:43,936
Should be amazing

774
00:41:44,704 --> 00:41:45,216
I would

775
00:41:46,496 --> 00:41:48,032
It'll be very inspirational

776
00:41:48,288 --> 00:41:53,407
It would probably go long a float

777
00:41:53,663 --> 00:41:56,991
If you want to know what it's like it's basically

778
00:41:57,247 --> 00:41:57,759
Episode

779
00:41:58,015 --> 00:42:00,319
It's what I felt was

780
00:42:00,831 --> 00:42:02,111
Worth going over

781
00:42:02,367 --> 00:42:03,391
But he said one

782
00:42:04,415 --> 00:42:05,695
That I thought is absolute

783
00:42:06,719 --> 00:42:08,511
Because he's talking to a group of

784
00:42:08,767 --> 00:42:10,303
The media Insider Folk

785
00:42:10,559 --> 00:42:12,607
And probably he's unaware that they're recording it

786
00:42:14,143 --> 00:42:16,191
Do you love like we all know

787
00:42:16,447 --> 00:42:17,215
I'm here

788
00:42:17,471 --> 00:42:20,543
From Alex

789
00:42:21,567 --> 00:42:23,103
He talks about his process

790
00:42:23,871 --> 00:42:24,383
And I think this is

791
00:42:24,639 --> 00:42:25,407
Kind of revealing

792
00:42:26,687 --> 00:42:30,527
My way up in every meeting at every system

793
00:43:13,791 --> 00:43:15,583
He's describing being a fabulous

794
00:43:16,863 --> 00:43:23,007
Describing like I have an instinct for sensationalizing

795
00:43:23,263 --> 00:43:23,775
Traffic

796
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:33,503
I know you will say that like I give it an accurate headline

797
00:43:33,759 --> 00:43:37,343
I'm sure that's what he likes to believe it's probably better presentation

798
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:40,415
I ate some patient lies the s*** out of things I understand

799
00:43:40,671 --> 00:43:43,487
Clickbait in my bones

800
00:43:44,255 --> 00:43:45,023
Exactly like

801
00:43:45,279 --> 00:43:48,607
A lot of the criticisms I would level at his journalistic style

802
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:51,935
Packard proving anything in flamboyant

803
00:43:53,983 --> 00:43:54,495
Things that are

804
00:43:54,751 --> 00:43:55,519
Horrifying

805
00:43:58,079 --> 00:43:58,847
Going on so what we do

806
00:43:59,871 --> 00:44:01,919
Nothing going on in Spanish

807
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:02,943
Yep

808
00:44:05,503 --> 00:44:06,783
That's b******* it's

809
00:44:07,039 --> 00:44:10,367
Because it also indicates an awareness

810
00:44:13,183 --> 00:44:14,463
However much of it

811
00:44:14,719 --> 00:44:16,255
Instinctual

812
00:44:16,511 --> 00:44:17,279
It's like when you're aware of

813
00:44:19,327 --> 00:44:19,839
And you're misleading

814
00:44:20,607 --> 00:44:21,631
Yeah my real ancestor

815
00:44:21,887 --> 00:44:22,911
Cesar William Randolph

816
00:44:24,447 --> 00:44:24,959
Haha

817
00:44:26,239 --> 00:44:28,543
That's black

818
00:44:28,799 --> 00:44:30,847
So Alex gets to talk to Ben Swann

819
00:44:34,687 --> 00:44:35,711
The station that he was working

820
00:44:36,479 --> 00:44:37,759
Alex

821
00:44:51,583 --> 00:44:54,143
Excited to see what Ben Swann does next

822
00:44:54,399 --> 00:44:54,911
Oh yeah

823
00:44:55,167 --> 00:45:01,311
I don't know exactly what he did

824
00:45:01,567 --> 00:45:06,943
I got fired

825
00:45:10,271 --> 00:45:11,039
Okay

826
00:45:12,063 --> 00:45:18,207
Okay that's that's the flavor that he's fishing out

827
00:45:18,463 --> 00:45:21,279
Boarding Alex Jones

828
00:45:21,535 --> 00:45:27,679
On a segment that he ran on the CBS station

829
00:45:28,191 --> 00:45:30,239
He was doing these

830
00:45:30,495 --> 00:45:31,007
Reports

831
00:45:31,263 --> 00:45:33,055
You got to stop

832
00:45:33,311 --> 00:45:36,127
That

833
00:45:36,639 --> 00:45:37,151
No

834
00:45:37,407 --> 00:45:38,175
No.

835
00:45:38,431 --> 00:45:39,455
Rated

836
00:45:39,711 --> 00:45:41,759
It's okay let the show go doormat

837
00:45:42,271 --> 00:45:43,807
But apparently he was going to

838
00:45:44,063 --> 00:45:45,087
To try and bring it back

839
00:45:45,343 --> 00:45:47,391
And then they fired

840
00:45:47,647 --> 00:45:50,463
If you're going to be pushed

841
00:45:51,743 --> 00:45:57,631
So local news broadcast

842
00:45:57,887 --> 00:45:59,935
We've got a remote report

843
00:46:00,447 --> 00:46:02,751
God can you imagine just watching WGN

844
00:46:03,007 --> 00:46:05,055
News at 5 and then all the sudden they're like

845
00:46:07,359 --> 00:46:11,455
These are murdering children underneath

846
00:46:11,967 --> 00:46:18,111
I might watch the news more honest loose I think it would be cool

847
00:46:18,367 --> 00:46:19,903
Grocery 2 News

848
00:46:21,439 --> 00:46:26,047
Also worked at RT for a little bit but I don't know

849
00:46:26,559 --> 00:46:28,351
Suspicious

850
00:46:28,863 --> 00:46:31,423
His career has

851
00:46:31,679 --> 00:46:33,471
I had a trajectory that seems to reflect

852
00:46:33,727 --> 00:46:35,007
Someone who believes

853
00:46:35,263 --> 00:46:38,847
Wacky nonsensical b*******

854
00:46:39,103 --> 00:46:45,247
To be a part of that team that won these Edward our probe before it's because everything else he's done in his career

855
00:46:46,271 --> 00:46:48,575
Award-worthy

856
00:46:48,831 --> 00:46:50,111
I mean how well was it

857
00:46:53,439 --> 00:46:55,487
Like the segments are well-produced

858
00:46:55,743 --> 00:46:57,023
The direction is perfect

859
00:46:57,535 --> 00:47:03,679
The cinematography is Grace I saw any different than most local news

860
00:47:03,935 --> 00:47:07,007
Nevermind

861
00:47:07,519 --> 00:47:08,031
But

862
00:47:08,543 --> 00:47:12,127
The story to be the Ben is leaving the station because

863
00:47:12,383 --> 00:47:15,967
He was told he couldn't cover things like gun grab

864
00:47:16,223 --> 00:47:17,247
Ron Paul

865
00:47:19,295 --> 00:47:22,367
But yes

866
00:47:22,623 --> 00:47:27,487
He's trying to push that need to sign off on it in order to authenticate this

867
00:47:27,743 --> 00:47:30,047
That's what he told us he's being silenced

868
00:47:30,303 --> 00:47:31,839
You can't trust any news

869
00:47:32,351 --> 00:47:33,631
But then

870
00:47:33,887 --> 00:47:34,399
This isn't

871
00:47:35,167 --> 00:47:35,679
That narrative

872
00:48:03,583 --> 00:48:05,119
Turn off

873
00:48:07,935 --> 00:48:12,543
These guys

874
00:48:22,015 --> 00:48:27,903
Totally believable at this point in his career was like I want to look at a bigger thing

875
00:48:28,159 --> 00:48:29,439
Then at a local news station

876
00:48:29,695 --> 00:48:30,463
Probably allows

877
00:48:30,975 --> 00:48:33,791
Like you got a bunch of attention from the like

878
00:48:34,047 --> 00:48:34,815
Patriot

879
00:48:35,071 --> 00:48:35,839
Right wing

880
00:48:36,095 --> 00:48:36,863
Media

881
00:48:37,375 --> 00:48:38,655
Beer liquor online

882
00:48:38,911 --> 00:48:40,703
He was covering Ron Paul stuff

883
00:48:40,959 --> 00:48:45,567
And I bet that really felt like this is a direction I should go in

884
00:48:45,823 --> 00:48:47,871
Butting heads

885
00:48:48,127 --> 00:48:49,407
With a local station

886
00:48:49,919 --> 00:48:50,943
Outside

887
00:48:52,479 --> 00:48:55,551
So obviously that would be like we should go separate ways

888
00:48:56,063 --> 00:48:57,087
No

889
00:48:57,343 --> 00:49:02,719
Go for it until then and tell them that's not what I

890
00:49:03,487 --> 00:49:04,767
So I can see that

891
00:49:05,279 --> 00:49:06,047
Being very believable

892
00:49:07,583 --> 00:49:08,095
Response being

893
00:49:08,351 --> 00:49:09,887
So based in his own ego

894
00:49:10,143 --> 00:49:12,191
That like this is what happened to me

895
00:49:12,447 --> 00:49:15,519
I need to discredit all video forces except my own

896
00:49:15,775 --> 00:49:16,287
I need

897
00:49:16,543 --> 00:49:20,895
Disturbia reality event situation better than

898
00:49:21,151 --> 00:49:22,175
Ben himself.

899
00:49:22,943 --> 00:49:23,967
Absalom

900
00:49:24,223 --> 00:49:24,735
A-to-z

901
00:49:25,247 --> 00:49:25,759
Is never

902
00:49:29,343 --> 00:49:29,855
Time somebody gives

903
00:49:30,367 --> 00:49:31,391
Very direct question

904
00:49:32,671 --> 00:49:33,183
To answer

905
00:49:33,695 --> 00:49:34,463
Affirmative

906
00:49:34,975 --> 00:49:35,487
Or negative

907
00:49:37,023 --> 00:49:37,791
The person responds to

908
00:49:38,303 --> 00:49:39,839
Well you know there are a lot of different things

909
00:49:40,095 --> 00:49:40,863
Do you know what the

910
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:47,263
Whatever answer you wanted to know what guess what I've got

911
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:50,847
Not no no

912
00:49:51,871 --> 00:49:55,455
He's excited for Ben Swann

913
00:49:55,711 --> 00:49:56,479
And he wants

914
00:49:56,735 --> 00:49:58,015
Him to work at Infowars

915
00:49:59,551 --> 00:50:00,575
Dependent not want to work

916
00:50:04,415 --> 00:50:04,927
He's not

917
00:50:06,207 --> 00:50:08,255
He's pretty friendly and seems to be

918
00:50:08,767 --> 00:50:09,791
Congratulatory of Alex

919
00:50:10,047 --> 00:50:10,559
Accomplishments

920
00:50:10,815 --> 00:50:15,423
He says that the Piers Morgan thing was the best thing he's ever seen on TV

921
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:18,239
I would imagine he knows well enough I like Ike

922
00:50:20,287 --> 00:50:21,055
Huge f******

923
00:50:21,311 --> 00:50:22,079
At least he's

924
00:50:22,591 --> 00:50:23,103
He's willing to leave

925
00:50:23,615 --> 00:50:24,383
Things open until

926
00:50:24,639 --> 00:50:25,407
Other local

927
00:50:26,431 --> 00:50:26,943
Right

928
00:50:27,199 --> 00:50:29,247
Adapter

929
00:50:30,271 --> 00:50:34,623
Alex

930
00:50:35,135 --> 00:50:35,647
Doesn't want

931
00:50:40,511 --> 00:50:44,095
Medium

932
00:50:44,351 --> 00:50:46,655
Future

933
00:50:55,359 --> 00:50:58,431
Off-base

934
00:51:10,463 --> 00:51:12,767
Alex

935
00:51:21,983 --> 00:51:22,495
There's no problem

936
00:51:24,287 --> 00:51:27,103
Haha no

937
00:51:27,359 --> 00:51:33,503
Exhaust trivial issues it don't really matter to you now

938
00:51:34,271 --> 00:51:37,343
I would say the rest that interview is not worthwhile

939
00:51:37,599 --> 00:51:38,623
It's mostly Alex trying

940
00:51:38,879 --> 00:51:43,487
To cast aspersions about the media

941
00:51:43,999 --> 00:51:45,791
I got forced out or whatever

942
00:51:46,815 --> 00:51:47,583
But

943
00:51:48,095 --> 00:51:49,887
We've heard Alex a lot of really onyx

944
00:51:51,679 --> 00:51:52,447
I would say

945
00:51:53,471 --> 00:51:53,983
Today

946
00:51:54,495 --> 00:51:55,775
Shirt

947
00:51:56,031 --> 00:51:57,055
And

948
00:51:57,311 --> 00:51:59,615
I would say to defrost a lot of lines

949
00:52:00,127 --> 00:52:01,407
This next clip

950
00:52:02,431 --> 00:52:03,199
He's crossed another line

951
00:52:03,711 --> 00:52:04,991
And this is why I'm going to have to

952
00:52:05,247 --> 00:52:05,759
Take very serious

953
00:52:10,367 --> 00:52:11,135
Kesha

954
00:52:11,647 --> 00:52:17,791
We're following her I want

955
00:52:35,711 --> 00:52:39,807
Tuba

956
00:52:40,831 --> 00:52:42,111
Don't you dare

957
00:52:42,367 --> 00:52:48,511
Mess with Kesha

958
00:52:48,767 --> 00:52:54,911
Right of music

959
00:52:55,167 --> 00:52:59,775
Yeah it was really weird to me is like okay this isn't April April 12th

960
00:53:00,031 --> 00:53:01,055
2013

961
00:53:01,311 --> 00:53:03,871
Kesha released Die Young

962
00:53:04,127 --> 00:53:06,687
6 *

963
00:53:06,943 --> 00:53:13,087
Yeah it was like fourth quarter 2012 that that came out

964
00:53:14,623 --> 00:53:20,767
Zeppelin real real trouble there's nothing current about this is your taking potshots at

965
00:53:22,047 --> 00:53:28,191
Also that song is not encouraging suicide most of the night like we're gonna die young.

966
00:53:32,543 --> 00:53:35,359
And it's not what they say

967
00:53:41,247 --> 00:53:44,063
The likes of Alex Jones

968
00:53:44,575 --> 00:53:50,719
How dare you

969
00:53:51,743 --> 00:53:52,255
How many times

970
00:53:52,767 --> 00:53:54,047
I've let this one go

971
00:53:55,839 --> 00:53:56,607
I still can't go after

972
00:53:57,631 --> 00:54:00,191
No new pink Alone 2

973
00:54:01,215 --> 00:54:06,079
Although I haven't heard anything of hers for quite a while but

974
00:54:06,335 --> 00:54:07,359
To run out of

975
00:54:07,615 --> 00:54:08,127
All over pink

976
00:54:08,383 --> 00:54:10,687
That may end up happening at some point but

977
00:54:11,199 --> 00:54:11,711
Kesha

978
00:54:12,223 --> 00:54:13,247
Carly Rae Jepsen

979
00:54:15,295 --> 00:54:21,439
Lana Del Rey to some extent

980
00:54:21,695 --> 00:54:26,303
Lana Del Rey think I've heard that before

981
00:54:27,071 --> 00:54:28,351
A lot darker

982
00:54:28,607 --> 00:54:31,167
Yeah I heard from Alex

983
00:54:31,679 --> 00:54:32,703
I've not heard it I'm sure it's great

984
00:54:33,215 --> 00:54:37,567
So like I mentioned has been hired at this point

985
00:54:37,823 --> 00:54:41,919
Describes this bit that he had her do like a lot

986
00:54:42,175 --> 00:54:46,271
Complaining

987
00:54:46,527 --> 00:54:48,319
When this is how he describes

988
00:54:48,831 --> 00:54:50,623
What he's having his employees do

989
00:55:04,959 --> 00:55:07,263
You just admitted that you stole from someone else

990
00:55:07,519 --> 00:55:09,311
It's already been done

991
00:55:10,335 --> 00:55:12,127
Great. Alex

992
00:55:12,383 --> 00:55:13,663
Original very fresh

993
00:55:14,687 --> 00:55:15,199
I hate it when

994
00:55:17,247 --> 00:55:17,759
Nocturnal

995
00:55:21,599 --> 00:55:23,135
Obsession on this episode with

996
00:55:23,391 --> 00:55:23,903
Visa

997
00:55:24,159 --> 00:55:25,951
Prank man-on-the-street videos

998
00:55:26,207 --> 00:55:28,767
I think Alex might be recognizing that like

999
00:55:29,279 --> 00:55:30,047
Okay

1000
00:55:30,559 --> 00:55:31,839
We're in a holding pattern

1001
00:55:32,095 --> 00:55:34,143
I've already got really extreme in my rhetoric

1002
00:55:34,911 --> 00:55:41,055
Now what we need to do is create a ReliOn waiting for something to happen

1003
00:55:44,895 --> 00:55:46,687
Completely manufacturer perception

1004
00:55:46,943 --> 00:55:52,063
We could just cut out all the people who talk to the van on the street that doesn't go along with

1005
00:55:52,319 --> 00:55:52,831
Preclude

1006
00:55:53,087 --> 00:55:59,231
The preconceived notion that we're pushing feels like

1007
00:55:59,487 --> 00:56:02,559
Talking about this Mark Dice video work

1008
00:56:02,815 --> 00:56:06,655
Yeah it's weird the real strong say

1009
00:56:06,911 --> 00:56:07,423
That I get

1010
00:56:07,679 --> 00:56:08,191
And just one

1011
00:56:08,703 --> 00:56:09,215
Revise to every

1012
00:56:10,751 --> 00:56:11,263
Especially those

1013
00:56:13,055 --> 00:56:13,567
How many times have

1014
00:56:15,359 --> 00:56:15,871
Go out on this

1015
00:56:18,175 --> 00:56:18,687
Dunked on

1016
00:56:19,199 --> 00:56:19,711
Some random ass

1017
00:56:23,039 --> 00:56:29,183
Shut the fuk up what happened when that kid flipped him off

1018
00:56:33,791 --> 00:56:37,375
Also you talked about this marked ice report I think there's some weird stuff going on

1019
00:56:37,631 --> 00:56:39,935
First of all birthdays reported

1020
00:56:40,191 --> 00:56:40,959
I don't give a s***

1021
00:56:41,983 --> 00:56:45,823
Nothing about it could ever be persuasive compelling funny into

1022
00:56:46,079 --> 00:56:47,359
None of it

1023
00:56:48,383 --> 00:56:49,663
Response to it and how he's using

1024
00:56:49,919 --> 00:56:50,687
I signed kind of

1025
00:57:11,935 --> 00:57:13,471
Because they

1026
00:57:13,727 --> 00:57:15,775
What's real

1027
00:57:23,199 --> 00:57:29,343
Video about like to hear that the

1028
00:57:29,599 --> 00:57:35,743
Duke China earlier this week probably high or drunk out on the boardwalk

1029
00:57:35,999 --> 00:57:36,767
About what this guy is saying

1030
00:57:38,815 --> 00:57:42,655
If you were to ask me about that on the street I like I don't know

1031
00:57:43,167 --> 00:57:44,447
Because I haven't heard that

1032
00:57:44,703 --> 00:57:50,847
Yeah but also I don't want to be like that didn't happen cuz maybe I looked at the news that day or something

1033
00:57:51,359 --> 00:57:52,383
It's manipulative

1034
00:57:52,639 --> 00:57:54,431
It's just f****** not said he's using it

1035
00:57:54,687 --> 00:57:56,479
The idea that everyone or zombies

1036
00:58:02,111 --> 00:58:04,415
Part of the game when you're doing man-on-the-street chick

1037
00:58:05,183 --> 00:58:05,951
Frieza

1038
00:58:06,207 --> 00:58:08,255
Unbelievably

1039
00:58:08,767 --> 00:58:09,279
That is

1040
00:58:09,791 --> 00:58:10,303
So

1041
00:58:10,559 --> 00:58:11,071
For real

1042
00:58:12,607 --> 00:58:13,375
Do you remember

1043
00:58:13,631 --> 00:58:14,911
Do you remember 9/11

1044
00:58:16,191 --> 00:58:17,215
Nobody was like

1045
00:58:19,263 --> 00:58:19,775
The Twin Towers

1046
00:58:20,799 --> 00:58:21,311
Moving on

1047
00:58:21,567 --> 00:58:26,431
Used in 2013

1048
00:58:26,687 --> 00:58:27,199
911

1049
00:58:27,455 --> 00:58:33,599
Yes

1050
00:58:34,111 --> 00:58:34,623
Because it didn't happen

1051
00:58:34,879 --> 00:58:38,975
Your response would be

1052
00:58:39,231 --> 00:58:40,255
Or something like that

1053
00:58:40,511 --> 00:58:45,375
Cut out of the video

1054
00:58:45,631 --> 00:58:46,655
Most people

1055
00:58:46,911 --> 00:58:50,239
As long as they were angry the person asking them to question

1056
00:58:50,495 --> 00:58:51,519
If there was a sort of

1057
00:58:52,031 --> 00:58:52,799
Friendly

1058
00:58:54,079 --> 00:58:58,175
I don't know that you're that

1059
00:58:58,687 --> 00:59:00,735
Or something

1060
00:59:03,039 --> 00:59:03,807
Or whatever

1061
00:59:07,391 --> 00:59:08,671
The only way

1062
00:59:09,439 --> 00:59:11,231
Tells you that that you don't already know it

1063
00:59:11,743 --> 00:59:13,023
In a genuine way

1064
00:59:13,279 --> 00:59:13,791
It is

1065
00:59:14,047 --> 00:59:15,071
You watch

1066
00:59:15,327 --> 00:59:18,143
Crowd of people running

1067
00:59:21,727 --> 00:59:22,239
You're like always

1068
00:59:24,543 --> 00:59:25,823
You find out it was an Improv Everywhere

1069
00:59:26,079 --> 00:59:32,223
I wouldn't I wouldn't put it past the organized crime people to run and yell at somebody

1070
00:59:32,479 --> 00:59:34,271
You say that you don't believe it

1071
00:59:35,295 --> 00:59:38,367
So now more about the Bar-Kays video about taking

1072
00:59:38,623 --> 00:59:41,951
People gone with the petition

1073
00:59:42,975 --> 00:59:43,743
Done

1074
00:59:45,791 --> 00:59:46,559
This is so weird

1075
01:00:09,343 --> 01:00:10,623
We are builders

1076
01:00:16,511 --> 01:00:22,655
We're going to just repeal the 2nd Amendment take the guns away from the crazy right wing

1077
01:00:22,911 --> 01:00:29,055
White extremists and just make sure that's the only

1078
01:00:32,639 --> 01:00:38,271
Alex be really focused on doing talking over this video to point out people's races

1079
01:00:38,783 --> 01:00:40,319
Like I use another example of it

1080
01:00:40,575 --> 01:00:41,343
I'm just a little bit later

1081
01:00:41,599 --> 01:00:47,743
Away their guns go birthday

1082
01:00:50,047 --> 01:00:51,071
What is going on

1083
01:00:51,583 --> 01:00:55,423
Why is it that most of the commentary that he gives over this video is like

1084
01:00:55,679 --> 01:00:59,519
The white guy signing it

1085
01:00:59,775 --> 01:01:04,895
That's really it's very strange that there is a sense of

1086
01:01:05,151 --> 01:01:08,223
Some somehow this has a real racial component to it

1087
01:01:08,735 --> 01:01:09,247
To Alex

1088
01:01:09,759 --> 01:01:11,039
That I feel is

1089
01:01:11,551 --> 01:01:12,063
Uncomfortable

1090
01:01:15,391 --> 01:01:15,903
And obviously

1091
01:01:16,927 --> 01:01:17,695
What I'm getting

1092
01:01:19,743 --> 01:01:20,255
FaceTime

1093
01:01:21,279 --> 01:01:21,791
Acknowledge of a

1094
01:01:23,071 --> 01:01:24,863
A white dude

1095
01:01:25,119 --> 01:01:25,631
Signing

1096
01:01:26,655 --> 01:01:27,167
Is this

1097
01:01:27,423 --> 01:01:27,935
Sign that the

1098
01:01:28,191 --> 01:01:28,703
Globalist

1099
01:01:29,727 --> 01:01:30,239
Veletri

1100
01:01:31,007 --> 01:01:34,847
Or just saying that he wants crazy right wing

1101
01:01:35,103 --> 01:01:35,615
White guys

1102
01:01:36,383 --> 01:01:38,175
Right

1103
01:01:38,431 --> 01:01:39,967
It's a betrayal salad

1104
01:01:40,223 --> 01:01:41,247
That's what that is

1105
01:01:43,295 --> 01:01:47,391
Because I did that I got but again I agree

1106
01:01:47,647 --> 01:01:50,207
Can't prove that feels like something

1107
01:01:50,463 --> 01:01:51,231
He does a bit

1108
01:01:52,255 --> 01:01:53,791
I meant ality that he has

1109
01:01:54,303 --> 01:01:56,095
So in the video Mark Dice

1110
01:01:56,607 --> 01:01:57,887
Fox around a little bit

1111
01:01:58,143 --> 01:01:59,935
I have visitors

1112
01:02:03,007 --> 01:02:09,151
Ustedes son slave thank you

1113
01:02:09,407 --> 01:02:15,551
Free Xbox to repeal the 2nd Amendment

1114
01:02:20,927 --> 01:02:27,071
It's pure genius charge birthday to offer at Xbox

1115
01:02:27,583 --> 01:02:29,887
That is there's no way

1116
01:02:30,143 --> 01:02:32,447
Anybody that has anything other than

1117
01:02:33,215 --> 01:02:33,983
Absolutely

1118
01:02:34,239 --> 01:02:39,615
Revolutionary Xbox

1119
01:02:42,431 --> 01:02:42,943
Stephen Hawking

1120
01:02:43,967 --> 01:02:44,991
Because if he had been listening

1121
01:02:45,247 --> 01:02:45,759
2 hour show

1122
01:02:46,271 --> 01:02:47,295
He could have gotten an email from

1123
01:02:48,319 --> 01:02:50,111
Got to confirm

1124
01:02:50,367 --> 01:02:52,927
Does prg

1125
01:02:53,439 --> 01:02:55,231
Here

1126
01:02:58,303 --> 01:03:00,095
Tewksbury fought

1127
01:03:02,399 --> 01:03:02,911
Mac

1128
01:03:03,167 --> 01:03:04,703
Arthur right right

1129
01:03:08,031 --> 01:03:08,799
Arthur

1130
01:03:09,311 --> 01:03:12,639
Name the words cause so much confusion

1131
01:03:12,895 --> 01:03:13,919
The worst

1132
01:03:14,431 --> 01:03:16,991
So Alex at this point

1133
01:03:18,271 --> 01:03:19,039
He's got to go

1134
01:03:19,551 --> 01:03:20,575
What he knows

1135
01:03:21,087 --> 01:03:21,599
He knows that

1136
01:03:21,855 --> 01:03:22,367
Steve pieczenik

1137
01:03:22,623 --> 01:03:24,415
You coming on his show all the f****** time

1138
01:03:24,927 --> 01:03:25,439
Stretch

1139
01:03:25,695 --> 01:03:26,975
Of April

1140
01:03:27,487 --> 01:03:29,791
I am so he's that intro in Steve here

1141
01:03:30,047 --> 01:03:31,583
I think the way he does this

1142
01:03:31,839 --> 01:03:32,351
Is like

1143
01:03:33,119 --> 01:03:34,399
So laughably abs

1144
01:03:57,951 --> 01:04:03,071
You gearing up to introduce Steve pieczenik he's complaining

1145
01:04:03,327 --> 01:04:05,119
Government people intelligence

1146
01:04:05,631 --> 01:04:06,399
Smoke

1147
01:04:06,655 --> 01:04:12,543
You're introducing a guy who fits that description perfectly what is wrong with you I was wondering

1148
01:04:13,567 --> 01:04:15,359
There's a

1149
01:04:15,615 --> 01:04:16,383
Which is

1150
01:04:17,663 --> 01:04:22,783
That's a great idea for a good guy

1151
01:04:31,743 --> 01:04:34,047
Former government but it's okay to have them on my

1152
01:04:34,303 --> 01:04:35,071
My show is just

1153
01:04:35,583 --> 01:04:37,887
Anybody whose former government who is willing to come up

1154
01:04:38,143 --> 01:04:43,007
And who's crazy and baby complains about minorities working in the TSA

1155
01:04:47,615 --> 01:04:48,639
Glowing introduction

1156
01:04:50,175 --> 01:04:51,967
In this club you'll hear some of that introduction

1157
01:04:53,247 --> 01:04:54,015
Steve a question

1158
01:04:54,271 --> 01:04:55,807
Human cannot

1159
01:04:56,575 --> 01:05:00,671
This isn't possible

1160
01:05:00,927 --> 01:05:02,207
Whatever he wants

1161
01:05:03,487 --> 01:05:04,767
Listen to this f****** question

1162
01:05:05,023 --> 01:05:05,791
This is absurd

1163
01:05:06,047 --> 01:05:08,095
Like if you're starting an interview with somebody

1164
01:05:08,351 --> 01:05:09,375
You don't do something like this

1165
01:05:23,199 --> 01:05:26,015
Between North Korea and others

1166
01:06:17,215 --> 01:06:23,103
Is not a good intro question

1167
01:06:23,615 --> 01:06:27,199
He throws out like 50 f****** ideas

1168
01:06:28,223 --> 01:06:30,271
If you have 5 references

1169
01:06:30,527 --> 01:06:32,063
His own website

1170
01:06:35,647 --> 01:06:38,463
I will be there not like

1171
01:06:38,719 --> 01:06:39,231
You don't need

1172
01:06:39,487 --> 01:06:44,607
You could just ask a straightforward question for a minute

1173
01:06:44,863 --> 01:06:48,191
I am just a person who supposed to answer that question

1174
01:06:48,447 --> 01:06:51,007
Possible for dab cuz they can't respond to all of them

1175
01:06:51,263 --> 01:06:54,591
Couldn't respond to all of that

1176
01:07:00,991 --> 01:07:05,599
Absolutely

1177
01:07:05,855 --> 01:07:08,671
Introducing either-or question

1178
01:07:08,927 --> 01:07:10,719
Those are all the options

1179
01:07:10,975 --> 01:07:15,583
Another possibility Focus this year

1180
01:07:15,839 --> 01:07:18,911
Irresponsible I counted eight

1181
01:07:22,751 --> 01:07:28,383
Is Alex out platters Eminem puts forth his version of what's going on

1182
01:07:28,639 --> 01:07:29,919
In North Korea which has been

1183
01:07:30,687 --> 01:07:31,967
His his

1184
01:07:32,223 --> 01:07:33,759
Business over the last week

1185
01:07:34,015 --> 01:07:34,783
What's a rolly

1186
01:07:35,295 --> 01:07:37,855
May or may not have been in South Korea ain't no f****** idea

1187
01:07:38,879 --> 01:07:40,927
But you know he does he does what he does best

1188
01:07:41,439 --> 01:07:41,951
And that is

1189
01:07:42,207 --> 01:07:43,231
Flatter the s*** out of our

1190
01:07:44,255 --> 01:07:47,583
This is unprecedented

1191
01:07:47,839 --> 01:07:53,983
No not at her Alex slept for so let me congratulate you I came here to San Francisco

1192
01:07:54,239 --> 01:07:55,263
Berkeley last night

1193
01:07:55,519 --> 01:07:57,055
And you are a hero and

1194
01:07:58,079 --> 01:08:04,223
Organization called the universe you are sitting at home

1195
01:08:04,479 --> 01:08:10,623
Audio quality isn't that different from when he was in South Korea very strange

1196
01:08:10,879 --> 01:08:11,903
.

1197
01:08:12,671 --> 01:08:13,439
Weird

1198
01:08:13,695 --> 01:08:14,207
Sitting

1199
01:08:14,463 --> 01:08:16,511
In his goddamn recliners

1200
01:08:16,767 --> 01:08:17,279
I'm in

1201
01:08:17,535 --> 01:08:21,631
I was at Berkeley and I got to say you're a hero of the left

1202
01:08:23,423 --> 01:08:24,191
F*** are you selling

1203
01:08:24,703 --> 01:08:28,031
What he's selling himself to Alex that he's doing a great job

1204
01:08:28,543 --> 01:08:30,079
Crazy is so good at this

1205
01:08:30,335 --> 01:08:31,615
Is flattery game

1206
01:08:32,383 --> 01:08:34,175
And the fact that Alex doesn't see through it

1207
01:08:34,431 --> 01:08:36,223
Naughty naughty

1208
01:08:36,479 --> 01:08:37,247
Brutal

1209
01:08:37,759 --> 01:08:39,551
If you were to go back in

1210
01:08:41,087 --> 01:08:41,855
Thought that would break

1211
01:08:44,415 --> 01:08:44,927
Got2b

1212
01:08:45,183 --> 01:08:46,463
Knowing what you know now listen

1213
01:08:50,303 --> 01:08:51,071
Yeah

1214
01:08:52,351 --> 01:08:53,631
Like this one

1215
01:08:54,399 --> 01:08:56,447
Is on me

1216
01:08:59,519 --> 01:09:02,335
Consistently for 5 to 10 years

1217
01:09:02,591 --> 01:09:04,127
That one's on me

1218
01:09:04,383 --> 01:09:09,503
Steve is running a quote-unquote psyop or whatever his actions but

1219
01:09:10,271 --> 01:09:12,063
Yep I was

1220
01:09:12,575 --> 01:09:14,111
Really other s***

1221
01:09:14,367 --> 01:09:14,879
Just seen that one

1222
01:09:18,719 --> 01:09:20,767
I could have asked you a follow-up question

1223
01:09:21,535 --> 01:09:22,815
Ever

1224
01:09:23,839 --> 01:09:29,983
Previous North Korea

1225
01:09:30,239 --> 01:09:33,823
Call Switcher

1226
01:09:34,591 --> 01:09:35,359
String pullers

1227
01:09:35,871 --> 01:09:39,455
Kim Jeong just really being a charge

1228
01:09:39,967 --> 01:09:40,479
Whatever

1229
01:09:40,991 --> 01:09:42,783
So it's not really worth all that much

1230
01:09:43,039 --> 01:09:44,575
He does say something

1231
01:09:44,831 --> 01:09:45,343
Respect

1232
01:09:45,855 --> 01:09:46,367
Dismay

1233
01:09:46,879 --> 01:09:47,391
Clip

1234
01:09:48,159 --> 01:09:49,439
And it's kind of indicative

1235
01:09:51,999 --> 01:09:53,023
Things that you be telling Alex

1236
01:09:53,535 --> 01:09:54,047
Years later

1237
01:09:54,559 --> 01:10:00,703
The CIA John Brennan who we know is totally incompetent and created a lot of them

1238
01:10:03,007 --> 01:10:07,103
General

1239
01:10:10,943 --> 01:10:11,711
Mike Flynn

1240
01:10:11,967 --> 01:10:13,503
Doesn't know anything

1241
01:10:15,295 --> 01:10:21,183
Michael Flynn is a part of the rent that he's putting together

1242
01:10:21,439 --> 01:10:25,791
Narrative needs to be put in place

1243
01:10:26,047 --> 01:10:27,839
Mike Flynn is a heroic

1244
01:10:28,095 --> 01:10:31,167
Know-it-all kind of General but now here

1245
01:10:31,935 --> 01:10:36,031
Next Windows no he's not

1246
01:10:36,287 --> 01:10:37,823
Interested in Mike slim that's interesting

1247
01:10:38,591 --> 01:10:39,615
Very different

1248
01:10:39,871 --> 01:10:40,383
Yeah

1249
01:10:41,663 --> 01:10:42,431
It really feels

1250
01:10:43,967 --> 01:10:44,479
Change

1251
01:10:46,015 --> 01:10:46,527
Not not the

1252
01:10:46,783 --> 01:10:47,295
The narrative

1253
01:10:48,319 --> 01:10:48,831
But the p

1254
01:10:49,087 --> 01:10:49,855
Pieces inside of it

1255
01:10:50,367 --> 01:10:51,647
Eunos like the narrative remains

1256
01:10:52,927 --> 01:10:54,207
However they were

1257
01:10:54,719 --> 01:10:55,231
Yeah

1258
01:10:55,487 --> 01:10:59,071
So we can Saturday

1259
01:10:59,583 --> 01:11:02,399
I don't have much

1260
01:11:02,655 --> 01:11:03,423
From this episode

1261
01:11:03,935 --> 01:11:04,959
It's really boring

1262
01:11:05,471 --> 01:11:06,239
It's like

1263
01:11:06,495 --> 01:11:10,847
There is a real lack of clips from a lot of issues because it's just kind of

1264
01:11:11,359 --> 01:11:13,151
Retreading the same stuff

1265
01:11:14,431 --> 01:11:15,711
I'm s*** over and over again

1266
01:11:15,967 --> 01:11:18,015
And I guess I did

1267
01:11:19,807 --> 01:11:21,087
Had an interview with shooter

1268
01:11:21,855 --> 01:11:23,647
Who he claims he's not having lunch

1269
01:11:23,903 --> 01:11:24,671
Because he loves Waylon

1270
01:11:25,439 --> 01:11:26,463
But

1271
01:11:27,743 --> 01:11:28,767
Inconsequential

1272
01:11:29,535 --> 01:11:31,839
Shooter I want on the

1273
01:11:32,095 --> 01:11:32,607
Infowars

1274
01:11:32,863 --> 01:11:33,375
The one from

1275
01:11:33,887 --> 01:11:34,911
Happy Gilmore

1276
01:11:35,935 --> 01:11:37,727
We can do that

1277
01:11:38,239 --> 01:11:41,567
Is completely irrelevant

1278
01:11:42,079 --> 01:11:44,127
Next is Alex signing off

1279
01:11:44,383 --> 01:11:44,895
The show

1280
01:11:45,151 --> 01:11:46,687
So here's a completely irrelevant

1281
01:11:47,455 --> 01:11:49,759
Piers Morgan

1282
01:11:50,271 --> 01:11:52,319
Record

1283
01:12:01,535 --> 01:12:07,423
Exclusive bodyguards there

1284
01:12:07,679 --> 01:12:10,239
Your Piers Morgan

1285
01:12:15,103 --> 01:12:16,895
Employees

1286
01:12:17,151 --> 01:12:20,223
Blackwater the former Blackwater guys

1287
01:12:20,479 --> 01:12:23,039
To go on planes with him everywhere

1288
01:12:23,551 --> 01:12:24,831
So I don't know he does

1289
01:12:25,087 --> 01:12:26,367
His wife does carrier

1290
01:12:27,135 --> 01:12:27,647
Revolver

1291
01:12:28,671 --> 01:12:29,183
Fine

1292
01:12:29,695 --> 01:12:32,767
You still need security I always bio

1293
01:12:33,023 --> 01:12:33,535
Come on

1294
01:12:35,327 --> 01:12:36,351
So that's that

1295
01:12:36,607 --> 01:12:37,375
Just a little bit silly

1296
01:12:37,631 --> 01:12:39,423
Here's how

1297
01:12:39,679 --> 01:12:41,727
He signs off the show like there really isn't

1298
01:12:41,983 --> 01:12:43,775
Much going on it's all just

1299
01:12:44,031 --> 01:12:45,567
These exact

1300
01:12:45,823 --> 01:12:48,127
Talking about that Family

1301
01:12:48,383 --> 01:12:51,967
Kidnapped kids and tried to flee to Cuba

1302
01:12:52,223 --> 01:12:53,759
The government's trying to take

1303
01:12:54,271 --> 01:12:56,575
A protester

1304
01:12:56,831 --> 01:12:57,599
City councilman

1305
01:13:05,023 --> 01:13:06,047
So repetitive

1306
01:13:06,303 --> 01:13:06,815
Just

1307
01:13:07,071 --> 01:13:08,351
It was my numbing to listen

1308
01:13:08,607 --> 01:13:09,887
Unto these couple days

1309
01:13:11,423 --> 01:13:13,727
That stuff about the mind-numbing

1310
01:13:17,055 --> 01:13:18,079
Very real

1311
01:13:18,335 --> 01:13:20,895
Terror in that too

1312
01:13:21,151 --> 01:13:25,247
These same things that have already looked into we've already discussed

1313
01:13:29,599 --> 01:13:31,135
Creating a panic

1314
01:13:31,391 --> 01:13:32,159
Naked still creating

1315
01:13:32,415 --> 01:13:36,511
A mentality in reinforcing it repeatedly that this is Armageddon

1316
01:13:36,767 --> 01:13:42,655
We're in the middle of this Civil War that I have decided we were in

1317
01:13:42,911 --> 01:13:47,263
Everything is an existential threat the globalist removing now because the Ten Years late

1318
01:13:47,519 --> 01:13:48,287
On their plan

1319
01:13:50,335 --> 01:13:51,359
Demonstrated

1320
01:13:51,615 --> 01:13:55,711
Yeah nothing is happening

1321
01:13:59,039 --> 01:13:59,807
It's like Road

1322
01:14:00,575 --> 01:14:02,623
It's like when you've been driving for a long time

1323
01:14:02,879 --> 01:14:03,647
And you're falling asleep

1324
01:14:04,671 --> 01:14:06,207
Like it cuz you forget

1325
01:14:06,463 --> 01:14:08,767
I am driving a

1326
01:14:09,279 --> 01:14:10,303
4 ton murder

1327
01:14:10,559 --> 01:14:11,583
Right

1328
01:14:11,839 --> 01:14:13,631
Honestly close to Falling us

1329
01:14:13,887 --> 01:14:16,703
Sleep

1330
01:14:17,215 --> 01:14:23,359
Conscious effect on people

1331
01:14:23,615 --> 01:14:25,919
If I'm here listening to this

1332
01:14:26,175 --> 01:14:29,247
And researching a narrative

1333
01:14:29,503 --> 01:14:31,807
And I am experiencing like

1334
01:14:32,319 --> 01:14:38,463
This is so repetitive

1335
01:14:38,719 --> 01:14:43,071
Being critical when you're listening

1336
01:14:44,095 --> 01:14:45,631
Like you internalize these things

1337
01:14:46,143 --> 01:14:47,935
I've internalize them as

1338
01:14:48,447 --> 01:14:54,591
Is it something you won't stop talking about but if you don't listen with a critical eye or even a sympathetic one if you had

1339
01:14:56,127 --> 01:14:56,639
Ears Dam

1340
01:14:57,151 --> 01:14:58,175
Like you could

1341
01:14:58,431 --> 01:14:59,199
Very easily

1342
01:14:59,711 --> 01:15:00,991
Without realizing it

1343
01:15:01,759 --> 01:15:03,039
Create inside yourself

1344
01:15:04,831 --> 01:15:05,343
The feeling

1345
01:15:05,599 --> 01:15:07,135
That these things are actually happening

1346
01:15:07,391 --> 01:15:09,951
What is the end of the world this is

1347
01:15:10,207 --> 01:15:11,487
The Democrats in the globalist

1348
01:15:11,743 --> 01:15:12,511
What's our about

1349
01:15:12,767 --> 01:15:13,279
To take the gun

1350
01:15:13,535 --> 01:15:15,583
And take you and your family off to it

1351
01:15:15,839 --> 01:15:16,863
Afema torture cap

1352
01:15:17,375 --> 01:15:17,887
Like it

1353
01:15:22,239 --> 01:15:22,751
Like even if you

1354
01:15:23,007 --> 01:15:23,519
You only listen

1355
01:15:23,775 --> 01:15:24,799
To Alex while you're in the

1356
01:15:27,103 --> 01:15:27,615
To the grocery store

1357
01:15:28,127 --> 01:15:29,151
But you have it on everyday

1358
01:15:30,175 --> 01:15:33,247
So you listen to 10 minutes everyday though

1359
01:15:33,503 --> 01:15:34,015
But if he keeps

1360
01:15:35,039 --> 01:15:35,807
Keep hearing the same

1361
01:15:37,343 --> 01:15:37,855
You're going to say

1362
01:15:38,111 --> 01:15:38,623
Oh my God

1363
01:15:40,927 --> 01:15:42,207
Talking about it yeah

1364
01:15:42,463 --> 01:15:42,975
If it weren't

1365
01:15:43,231 --> 01:15:43,743
So

1366
01:15:43,999 --> 01:15:47,071
There's a subconscious thing the people expect people to act

1367
01:15:47,327 --> 01:15:50,655
Straight up you know like so

1368
01:15:51,423 --> 01:15:52,191
You would think

1369
01:15:52,703 --> 01:15:54,495
Whether you actually think this or today

1370
01:15:55,007 --> 01:15:55,775
Subconscious

1371
01:15:56,287 --> 01:15:59,103
You'd be telling yourself like if he said that 2 weeks ago

1372
01:15:59,359 --> 01:16:05,503
And he was wrong correct himself just keeps going

1373
01:16:05,759 --> 01:16:10,111
It kind of you must know what he's talking about he has

1374
01:16:10,367 --> 01:16:10,879
Correct

1375
01:16:11,135 --> 01:16:12,159
No one sued him

1376
01:16:12,415 --> 01:16:13,439
Rice

1377
01:16:13,695 --> 01:16:14,463
It's just

1378
01:16:14,719 --> 01:16:17,791
Write the experience of it is really weird because

1379
01:16:18,047 --> 01:16:22,143
Yeah I know that the Boston bombing is tomorrow it has chronology

1380
01:16:22,655 --> 01:16:24,959
And I know that

1381
01:16:25,471 --> 01:16:26,239
So I don't

1382
01:16:28,031 --> 01:16:30,591
You never really find exactly what you expect

1383
01:16:31,615 --> 01:16:32,127
I guess you could

1384
01:16:32,383 --> 01:16:32,895
Kind of

1385
01:16:33,919 --> 01:16:35,711
Because there is no connection

1386
01:16:36,223 --> 01:16:36,991
Necessarily

1387
01:16:37,247 --> 01:16:38,015
Between his show

1388
01:16:38,271 --> 01:16:44,415
And it's not like you would expect the show to be

1389
01:16:44,671 --> 01:16:50,047
To real-world events

1390
01:16:51,327 --> 01:16:52,095
It's fascinating

1391
01:16:52,607 --> 01:16:54,655
That it is it is this way

1392
01:16:54,911 --> 01:16:59,775
It is molasses to walk through it

1393
01:17:01,567 --> 01:17:02,335
It'll get

1394
01:17:02,591 --> 01:17:03,615
Where it's going

1395
01:17:04,127 --> 01:17:04,895
But

1396
01:17:05,151 --> 01:17:06,687
Off the show

1397
01:17:07,967 --> 01:17:10,271
Tomorrow 11 a.m.

1398
01:17:18,975 --> 01:17:22,047
AOL

1399
01:17:22,559 --> 01:17:28,703
So if you believe that America has been taken over

1400
01:17:28,959 --> 01:17:29,727
Keeps calling

1401
01:17:29,983 --> 01:17:32,031
The people in the government in occupying

1402
01:17:32,287 --> 01:17:33,055
Force

1403
01:17:33,567 --> 01:17:37,663
I mean we could unpack for a second how that's the exact same rhetoric

1404
01:17:37,919 --> 01:17:39,455
Exact same mentality

1405
01:17:39,711 --> 01:17:40,479
The exact same

1406
01:17:40,735 --> 01:17:41,247
Description

1407
01:17:41,503 --> 01:17:44,319
As neo-nazis talkin about a Zionist occupied governor

1408
01:17:44,575 --> 01:17:47,391
He just texted the Zionist apartment

1409
01:17:48,159 --> 01:17:49,951
You can talk about that

1410
01:17:50,463 --> 01:17:51,743
Touchdown a bunch of the past

1411
01:17:53,023 --> 01:17:54,047
You talk about how

1412
01:17:54,303 --> 01:17:54,815
Like

1413
01:17:55,839 --> 01:17:57,887
This is all this is all just waiting

1414
01:17:58,143 --> 01:17:58,655
Looking for the spark

1415
01:17:58,911 --> 01:18:01,215
Yeah like all of it is so bad

1416
01:18:01,471 --> 01:18:03,775
And waiting for the spark that comes

1417
01:18:04,031 --> 01:18:05,311
Tomorrow

1418
01:18:05,567 --> 01:18:06,079
It's

1419
01:18:07,359 --> 01:18:08,895
It's exactly what he needs

1420
01:18:09,151 --> 01:18:10,175
This is like re-watch

1421
01:18:11,711 --> 01:18:12,223
Dragon Ball Z

1422
01:18:14,015 --> 01:18:15,039
Like wet when they're doing the tray

1423
01:18:16,575 --> 01:18:20,159
Dude I know tomorrow we're going to f****** fight Frieza

1424
01:18:20,415 --> 01:18:24,255
Why are we spending all day today just

1425
01:18:30,655 --> 01:18:31,679
Easter 2013

1426
01:18:31,935 --> 01:18:33,727
Episode

1427
01:18:33,983 --> 01:18:35,007
Have experience

1428
01:18:35,263 --> 01:18:38,335
That's right because the things that are going to happen

1429
01:18:38,847 --> 01:18:39,359
I bet

1430
01:18:39,615 --> 01:18:40,895
After the bombing

1431
01:18:42,687 --> 01:18:43,199
Continuation

1432
01:18:43,455 --> 01:18:44,479
Of the rhetoric

1433
01:18:44,735 --> 01:18:45,247
And

1434
01:18:45,503 --> 01:18:47,039
The world

1435
01:18:47,295 --> 01:18:49,343
Built up over the course

1436
01:18:49,599 --> 01:18:50,367
All the last

1437
01:18:50,623 --> 01:18:51,903
2 months

1438
01:18:52,415 --> 01:18:54,719
Isolated

1439
01:18:54,975 --> 01:18:58,047
Right I'm almost positive everything is going to be

1440
01:18:58,303 --> 01:19:01,631
Hey I was right about everything and complete escalation

1441
01:19:01,887 --> 01:19:02,911
All the dangerous trend

1442
01:19:03,935 --> 01:19:04,447
Particularly

1443
01:19:04,703 --> 01:19:05,215
Beginning

1444
01:19:05,727 --> 01:19:08,287
Probably going to see Steve pieczenik stick around

1445
01:19:08,543 --> 01:19:10,079
To take an even more prominent role

1446
01:19:12,639 --> 01:19:13,151
It's a mess

1447
01:19:13,663 --> 01:19:15,199
The map do the circumstance

1448
01:19:17,759 --> 01:19:18,271
You feel

1449
01:19:18,527 --> 01:19:19,039
Raymour and

1450
01:19:20,319 --> 01:19:21,087
People who already

1451
01:19:21,599 --> 01:19:22,367
We're sympathetic to

1452
01:19:22,623 --> 01:19:23,903
What are now like

1453
01:19:24,415 --> 01:19:25,183
Not only is he

1454
01:19:25,439 --> 01:19:25,951
Bi-Rite

1455
01:19:26,719 --> 01:19:30,559
Right now well because he frames everything as a false flag

1456
01:19:39,263 --> 01:19:41,567
How dare you ask that

1457
01:19:41,823 --> 01:19:43,871
How dare you

1458
01:19:48,479 --> 01:19:52,831
Because he sees it that way he's going to make the argument that

1459
01:19:53,087 --> 01:19:56,415
Forever the Volkswagen, I told you

1460
01:19:56,671 --> 01:20:02,303
The last week's was about to happen I could feel it and all this but we've got over and listen to it

1461
01:20:02,559 --> 01:20:05,375
Always him saying that the globe

1462
01:20:06,911 --> 01:20:07,423
He's going

1463
01:20:07,679 --> 01:20:08,447
To be right

1464
01:20:08,959 --> 01:20:13,055
If you are dumb uncritically listening to the show but he's wrong

1465
01:20:13,311 --> 01:20:14,080
Actual

1466
01:20:14,336 --> 01:20:17,408
A real serious problem

1467
01:20:17,664 --> 01:20:18,432
I really think

1468
01:20:19,456 --> 01:20:20,480
Well we live in 2019

1469
01:20:20,992 --> 01:20:21,504
And yes it is

1470
01:20:23,040 --> 01:20:26,112
I think it's going to be a bore of you and your problem

1471
01:20:26,368 --> 01:20:32,000
He's going to be able to play around with those ideas of credibility

1472
01:20:32,256 --> 01:20:32,768
Maybe

1473
01:20:33,024 --> 01:20:34,560
Much like Icarus

1474
01:20:35,072 --> 01:20:36,096
Give him my too much

1475
01:20:37,120 --> 01:20:38,400
Fly to close

1476
01:20:38,656 --> 01:20:39,168
Bassano's

1477
01:20:39,680 --> 01:20:40,960
Saying everybody is actors in

1478
01:20:42,752 --> 01:20:45,056
He's already there

1479
01:20:45,312 --> 01:20:48,128
He's not saying the hook with actors

1480
01:20:48,384 --> 01:20:49,920
Buddies dancing around

1481
01:20:50,176 --> 01:20:52,736
He's tipping he's dipping his Towing it prior to the bomb

1482
01:20:53,248 --> 01:20:56,832
He's calling other things like the Aurora shooting there were actors there

1483
01:20:57,600 --> 01:20:58,624
Is the victims and survivors

1484
01:20:59,136 --> 01:21:00,672
He's already

1485
01:21:00,928 --> 01:21:01,952
On the precipice

1486
01:21:02,464 --> 01:21:04,256
What's the razon devices

1487
01:21:04,512 --> 01:21:05,280
Future job

1488
01:21:05,536 --> 01:21:06,560
With or without the bottom

1489
01:21:06,816 --> 01:21:10,144
I think it's unrelated but it also might be a huge catalyst

1490
01:21:10,400 --> 01:21:11,936
Immediately

1491
01:21:12,448 --> 01:21:14,240
Aggressively

1492
01:21:15,264 --> 01:21:17,824
But we'll see

1493
01:21:18,080 --> 01:21:19,360
Kind of like a little nervous bouncy

1494
01:21:19,872 --> 01:21:20,384
Open down

1495
01:21:20,640 --> 01:21:21,152
And then

1496
01:21:21,408 --> 01:21:21,920
Boston bomber

1497
01:21:24,480 --> 01:21:26,272
Yeah it almost feels like this

1498
01:21:26,528 --> 01:21:28,576
Except our prediction was right

1499
01:21:30,368 --> 01:21:32,160
To the Boston bombing

1500
01:21:33,440 --> 01:21:36,000
Cover

1501
01:21:36,256 --> 01:21:37,280
Alex's response

1502
01:21:37,536 --> 01:21:38,560
To the tragedy

1503
01:21:38,816 --> 01:21:39,328
Boston

1504
01:21:39,584 --> 01:21:42,912
Next 2013 episode

1505
01:21:45,728 --> 01:21:47,264
Not like the 2015 investigate

1506
01:21:47,520 --> 01:21:48,288
Station at

1507
01:21:49,056 --> 01:21:49,568
So many different

1508
01:21:50,848 --> 01:21:51,616
Yeah

1509
01:21:52,384 --> 01:21:53,920
It's very weird Baryonyx

1510
01:21:54,176 --> 01:21:55,456
Expected but it's

1511
01:21:57,504 --> 01:21:58,016
Baby

1512
01:21:58,272 --> 01:21:59,040
Baby learning

1513
01:22:00,832 --> 01:22:01,856
Anymore

1514
01:22:02,112 --> 01:22:04,672
Kind of like covering both the president and

1515
01:22:04,928 --> 01:22:05,440
Somewhat

1516
01:22:05,696 --> 01:22:06,976
A targeted

1517
01:22:07,232 --> 01:22:08,256
Simultaneous

1518
01:22:12,096 --> 01:22:13,632
