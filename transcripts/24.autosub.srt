Because of the global

28
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:25,760
There's no doubt the global is interwoven in this lack of a friendship

29
00:01:26,016 --> 00:01:28,064
Episode

00:01:47,776 --> 00:01:49,312
This is not a legit Alex Jones podcast

41
00:01:50,592 --> 00:01:52,896

00:01:54,432 --> 00:01:56,992

00:02:25,664 --> 00:02:26,432
Getting good reporting

56
00:02:27,968 --> 00:02:34,112
For saying this it was viral we're just commenting on why you guys being such a pictures about it that's kind of his

57
00:02:35,904 --> 00:02:39,232
The language of his apology I texted you about this before the show

58
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:40,768
I'm certain he's getting

59
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:42,560
Absolutely

60
00:02:44,096 --> 00:02:45,632

The way he keeps saying like

62
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:50,496
We we we heard these things

63
00:02:51,008 --> 00:02:57,152
Victor report here anymore

64
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:01,248
At the very least got a

65
00:03:01,504 --> 00:03:06,624
Strongly-worded letter 100%

66
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:09,952
Unpack is that a couple months ago he put out a video on YouTube

67
00:03:10,464 --> 00:03:12,768
Call the final word on Sandy Hook

68
00:03:13,536 --> 00:03:17,120
He's already got the final Shout

69
00:03:17,376 --> 00:03:17,888
Which

70
00:03:20,448 --> 00:03:23,520
Realize the people were attacking him

71
00:03:23,776 --> 00:03:28,384
For being a Sandy Hook truther and all this stuff you wanted

72
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,688
To put out a video that once and for all

73
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:31,968
Spoke his piece

74
00:03:33,248 --> 00:03:34,016
About Sandy Hook

75
00:03:34,272 --> 00:03:37,088
Was it just him shiting on the competent

76
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:40,416
Just a

77
00:03:40,672 --> 00:03:44,512
Piece of paper with grief written on it as a shift on the desk

78
00:03:44,768 --> 00:03:46,048
To work quilt done

79
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:51,424
And all of the pieces of it

80
00:03:52,448 --> 00:03:54,752
That's what the video should have been

81
00:03:55,776 --> 00:04:00,640
That's the image in my head from now on in reality

82
00:04:01,152 --> 00:04:02,176
A bunch of circle

83
00:04:03,456 --> 00:04:04,736
Bulshit pieces of evidence

84
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:09,088
I met him at the end being like

85
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:12,672
This investigation is going to be ongoing

86
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:14,720
No

87
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:25,471
Call

88
00:04:25,727 --> 00:04:29,055
I'm starting to recognize their pieces of things

89
00:04:30,335 --> 00:04:31,103
His Stead

90
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:33,407
That he's starting to walk back really hard

91
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:35,711
Is one of them

92
00:04:35,967 --> 00:04:36,991
Sandy Hook

93
00:04:37,503 --> 00:04:39,551
You did a bad job of it in that video

94
00:04:39,807 --> 00:04:41,599
Foodies trying to do is like

95
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:47,999
And that means

96
00:04:48,255 --> 00:04:48,767
Trouble

97
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:50,815
That

98
00:04:51,071 --> 00:04:53,887
When you have any clips of him ever apologize

99
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:57,215
Not really

100
00:04:57,471 --> 00:05:00,799
I may have gotten something wrong before he's also always said

101
00:05:01,311 --> 00:05:02,591
But really I got it right

102
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:03,615
Yeah yeah

103
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:06,687
I was more right than wrong

104
00:05:06,943 --> 00:05:08,223
Yeah

105
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:13,343
But I will say that ninety-nine percent of the time we report on his right

106
00:05:13,599 --> 00:05:15,135
And frankly that probably

107
00:05:18,207 --> 00:05:20,767
That's like

108
00:05:21,023 --> 00:05:26,399
I'm still plugged into the Zeitgeist but even when I try to lie I

109
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:29,983
Anyway let's get

110
00:05:30,239 --> 00:05:31,263
The 23rd

111
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:33,311
This is going to be a rollercoaster ride

112
00:05:35,871 --> 00:05:38,175
Sort of all over the place beginning

113
00:05:38,687 --> 00:05:40,479
Then this interview that I mentioned

114
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:41,759
And then

115
00:05:42,783 --> 00:05:44,319
Esoteric malaise

Weird and unusual type of a syllabus

00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:12,223
Clip of it involved

That they're targeting

126
00:06:22,719 --> 00:06:23,487
President-trump

127
00:06:25,023 --> 00:06:27,839
Russian software that they've stolen our using

128
00:06:28,351 --> 00:06:28,863

And have plausible deniability

149
00:07:51,295 --> 00:07:51,807
Now

150
00:07:52,063 --> 00:07:54,367
If Alex Jones is saying that these people

00:07:55,903 --> 00:07:58,207

00:07:58,719 --> 00:08:00,255

00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:20,991
The definition of word

156
00:08:22,271 --> 00:08:24,063

Anyway

166
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:01,183
Alex Jones

167
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:01,951
Is

168
00:09:02,463 --> 00:09:03,487
In this episode

169
00:09:03,743 --> 00:09:06,303
And throughout this last week has been pretty

170
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:09,375
Certain is the right word I think

171
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:10,655
Vicky's being oppressed

172
00:09:11,423 --> 00:09:14,239
He's got a real victim complex going on

173
00:09:14,495 --> 00:09:15,263
He's being oppressed

174
00:09:17,055 --> 00:09:18,079
Explores little bit of his thoughts

175
00:09:19,103 --> 00:09:22,687
And their phones

176
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:27,039
Again it's a few months ago

177
00:09:27,551 --> 00:09:28,575
Nancy Pelosi

00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:34,975

179
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:41,375

That will be Odyssey seeing soon

181
00:09:46,495 --> 00:09:47,007

00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:06,719
Time to really go after Alex

187
00:10:09,023 --> 00:10:11,583
Your plan was to get you as far away from powers

188
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:19,263
Former Attorney General

As established

195
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:44,351
Loretta Lynch

196
00:10:44,607 --> 00:10:47,679
Wouldn't have stopped being attorney general Hillary won

197
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:51,263
Yeah well that's obvious when they were making

198
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:52,031
Movies playing

199
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:55,359
Before Alex Jones was really that

200
00:10:56,895 --> 00:11:00,991
He was important

201
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:04,063
Play

202
00:11:04,319 --> 00:11:06,879
I wish I wish there was less true than that

203
00:11:07,135 --> 00:11:07,647
Area code

204
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:09,439
Understand

205
00:11:09,951 --> 00:11:16,095
Officially already have Obama and Hillary Clinton

206
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:20,959
Is it

207
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:24,287
Down the street

208
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:28,895
Yeah it's just Roblox McDonald's

209
00:11:30,175 --> 00:11:30,943
You know where it exists

210
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:33,759
Inside his little fancy brain world

211
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:39,135
That's where it that's the address Alex Jones

212
00:11:42,975 --> 00:11:46,815
Tell me the bunkers

213
00:11:47,071 --> 00:11:48,607
This bunker bunker

214
00:11:48,863 --> 00:11:52,191
Excuse me sir I don't know when you turn to do a something

215
00:11:54,239 --> 00:11:56,287
Call of Duty

216
00:12:02,431 --> 00:12:03,455
You want us to know

217
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:06,271
We're coming after you

218
00:12:06,527 --> 00:12:07,807
Good lawyers get ready

219
00:12:09,599 --> 00:12:12,415
And they're already

220
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:14,975
Just Sharon

221
00:12:15,231 --> 00:12:17,791
Letters to Google and letters of a company saying

222
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:18,815
You kickoff

223
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:29,055
That talked last month

224
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:33,407
Oh we're not allowed

225
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:38,783
Because

226
00:12:42,623 --> 00:12:45,951
You don't get a hearing you don't get a hearing

227
00:12:46,463 --> 00:12:49,023
Because it's not a it's not a legal thing

228
00:12:50,815 --> 00:12:53,375
Violated

229
00:12:53,631 --> 00:12:57,983
Necessarily

230
00:13:02,335 --> 00:13:04,895
Especially what Libertarians what should believe in

231
00:13:05,151 --> 00:13:07,455
We've been over this a hundred times is all Admiral

232
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:12,575
I was ticked off because of the FEC narrative is is complete nonsense

233
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:16,415
Like what he just said

234
00:13:16,671 --> 00:13:17,439
What is the best

235
00:13:18,207 --> 00:13:19,231
Evidence for

236
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:19,999
Him being

237
00:13:21,535 --> 00:13:22,559
Two papers by a lawyer

238
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:24,863
Like

239
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:26,399
He is telling the truth

240
00:13:26,911 --> 00:13:28,447
Somebody is issuing him paper

241
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:29,471
Yes

242
00:13:33,055 --> 00:13:35,103
They're just the front

243
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:37,151
The first wave you know that's there

244
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:40,223
Pelosi is operating secretly behind him

245
00:13:40,479 --> 00:13:40,991
It's just

246
00:13:41,503 --> 00:13:42,015
The joint

247
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:44,319
All he wants is the pizza joint

248
00:13:47,647 --> 00:13:50,719
Spell just say it is

249
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:52,255
Just James alefantis

250
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:54,559
Then, ping pong

251
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:57,631
It seems the most likely

252
00:13:57,887 --> 00:13:59,167
Scenario

253
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:00,959
If that is the case

254
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:05,055
Like he deserves to be sued

255
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:07,615
That's a good

256
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:09,663
What would the

257
00:14:10,687 --> 00:14:12,479
It wouldn't be you can't

258
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:15,039
Yeah

259
00:14:16,575 --> 00:14:17,087
Hard

260
00:14:17,599 --> 00:14:19,391
What

261
00:14:19,903 --> 00:14:22,719
It's defamatory statements that were made

262
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:25,023
Speculation

263
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:26,303
Sweet but it wasn't

264
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:30,655
It was them Justin

265
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:33,215
Pizza Joint was a front

266
00:14:33,727 --> 00:14:34,495
Hillary Clinton

267
00:14:34,751 --> 00:14:40,895
Grape children's dosing at all

268
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:46,527
More revenue streams in this day and age

269
00:14:48,063 --> 00:14:49,087
The joint

270
00:14:49,855 --> 00:14:51,391
Picked man you must be a great

271
00:14:52,671 --> 00:14:54,463
Only raped

272
00:14:56,767 --> 00:15:00,351
If you if you go back and look at some of the stuff

273
00:15:00,607 --> 00:15:02,143
Some of the statements that were made

274
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:02,911
Goodbye

275
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:05,727
Employees of Comet Ping Pong and James alefantis

276
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:07,007
Back when this was first

277
00:15:07,263 --> 00:15:07,775
Starting up

278
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:11,615
There's a bunch of threats that they got to their business

279
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:14,687
Threaten threaten

280
00:15:14,943 --> 00:15:16,735
Situation where

281
00:15:17,247 --> 00:15:18,015
Became

282
00:15:18,271 --> 00:15:19,551
Barstool to ever come to

283
00:15:20,831 --> 00:15:21,599
Of course

284
00:15:22,623 --> 00:15:23,391
Yeah I agree

285
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:26,975
Now we're actually just

286
00:15:27,231 --> 00:15:28,767
Is disgusting a full-out illegal

287
00:15:29,023 --> 00:15:32,351
It isn't becoming episode of Handel on the law

288
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:35,167
Boston Legal

289
00:15:37,727 --> 00:15:41,567
But but wouldn't it be the originator of the claim like

290
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:45,919
Never never originated in idea

291
00:15:46,175 --> 00:15:47,199
Other than the ones that

292
00:15:47,711 --> 00:15:48,223
Just making up

293
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:52,063
Cuz I don't know I'm not I'm not sure how that would work

294
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:53,087
But I know

295
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:53,855
Deism

296
00:15:54,111 --> 00:15:55,135
Ratably guilty of

297
00:15:55,391 --> 00:15:58,719
Perpetuating the biggest

298
00:15:58,975 --> 00:16:01,279
He had like there's this guy named

299
00:16:01,535 --> 00:16:02,047
Petopia

300
00:16:02,303 --> 00:16:04,351
It is a complete monster

301
00:16:04,607 --> 00:16:05,631
Star Wars

302
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:09,471
Evening videotaping

303
00:16:09,727 --> 00:16:11,519
Himself going to Comet Ping Pong

304
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:14,335
And comment on Festa Pizza

305
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:16,383
The two pizza places on the same block

306
00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:22,015
They're all in the mix

307
00:16:26,367 --> 00:16:29,951
You videotape himself going into besta pizza and nothing happened

308
00:16:30,463 --> 00:16:33,023
Nothing happened there was nothing weird

309
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:35,583
And then as soon as he left so f****** weird in there

310
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:36,607
Oh my God

311
00:16:39,167 --> 00:16:45,055
Show like The Messengers

312
00:16:48,383 --> 00:16:50,943
He tries to order some food everyone's treatment real nice

313
00:16:51,455 --> 00:16:51,967
He goes in

314
00:16:52,479 --> 00:16:54,271
Kia is trying to livestream it

315
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:57,343
And one of the waiters realizes what's going on

316
00:16:57,599 --> 00:16:58,367
This guy

317
00:16:58,879 --> 00:16:59,903
Is videotaping himself

318
00:17:00,159 --> 00:17:00,671
Eating

319
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:02,719
It's not a coincidence

320
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:05,791
Especially wow all the pizzagate stuff

321
00:17:06,047 --> 00:17:08,095
What's going on explain

322
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:09,119
My employees have

323
00:17:10,143 --> 00:17:12,703
Do you understand that you're helping perpetuate something

324
00:17:14,751 --> 00:17:15,263
People

325
00:17:15,519 --> 00:17:17,567
Just people who are trying to live their lives in

326
00:17:20,127 --> 00:17:20,639
Lives

327
00:17:22,431 --> 00:17:24,223
Start bringing guns

328
00:17:24,479 --> 00:17:24,991
Places

329
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:34,719
Jefferson bogosian

330
00:17:35,231 --> 00:17:36,255
This guy claims to him

331
00:17:36,511 --> 00:17:38,559
The people have been threatened and it's no joke

332
00:17:38,815 --> 00:17:39,839
It's not a laughing matter

333
00:17:46,239 --> 00:17:48,031
Come on what's going on

334
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:50,079
There's an off-duty cop there

335
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:53,407
Everything was

336
00:17:53,663 --> 00:17:56,479
F****** weird in there they find me out

337
00:17:56,735 --> 00:17:57,247
To be a cop

338
00:17:57,503 --> 00:17:59,295
Himself right

339
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:03,647

He left

342
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:10,303
And then he was like

343
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:13,631
Everything was demonic in there

344
00:18:13,887 --> 00:18:17,727
There's a back room there keeps running in and out of it what's going on here

345
00:18:17,983 --> 00:18:23,103
Didn't show any of that new video making s*** up

346
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:24,127
I watched

347
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:24,895
Tire like

348
00:18:25,151 --> 00:18:26,431
2 hour long live stream

349
00:18:26,687 --> 00:18:28,223
Somebody posted

350
00:18:29,247 --> 00:18:30,783
There's nothing

351
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:32,575
And then like the next

352
00:18:32,831 --> 00:18:33,343

355
00:18:40,767 --> 00:18:42,047
He's lying

356
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:44,863
There's a bunch of stuff

357
00:18:45,119 --> 00:18:45,631
Happen

358
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:48,447
No one's going to go watch the whole video

359
00:18:48,703 --> 00:18:49,471
It's two hours long

360
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:53,055
You're the only person who

361
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:54,079

Drove from out of state

Bunch of other these ding-dong assholes

387
00:20:07,807 --> 00:20:10,623
Get out for you is the reason that I was probably going to go

388
00:20:11,647 --> 00:20:13,695
I also believe that the reason

389
00:20:15,231 --> 00:20:16,767
He's being investigated

390
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:18,047
As he puts it

391
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:21,631
And that last clip is not because we will think he's a Russian

392
00:20:22,911 --> 00:20:23,935
It's because there are Russian

393
00:20:24,191 --> 00:20:24,959
Russian

394
00:20:25,471 --> 00:20:26,239
Satar

395
00:20:27,007 --> 00:20:28,287
Specifically promoting

396
00:20:28,543 --> 00:20:29,055
His contact

397
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:30,335
Okay

398
00:20:30,591 --> 00:20:33,151
And the question that the FBI is apparently asked

399
00:20:33,407 --> 00:20:34,431
According to the article

400
00:20:34,687 --> 00:20:35,199
But I've read

401
00:20:35,711 --> 00:20:36,223
Is

402
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:37,503
Is there coordination

403
00:20:38,271 --> 00:20:39,551
Is there

404
00:20:39,807 --> 00:20:41,343
Collaborative thing going on

405
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:43,903
Where these Russian Bots promote in Fort Worth,

406
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:45,951
Really

407
00:20:46,207 --> 00:20:47,743
Is there any influence

408
00:20:47,999 --> 00:20:49,279
From Russian sources

409
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:51,327
Into Alex's reporting

410
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:53,119
You would say

411
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:56,447
Normally there's no way there's

412
00:20:56,703 --> 00:20:57,215
Collusion

413
00:20:58,495 --> 00:20:59,007
Collaboration

414
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:00,031
Because

415
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:01,567
Who would you wouldn't

416
00:21:01,823 --> 00:21:02,335
Even need to talk

417
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:04,383
To Alex if you gave if you gave me

418
00:21:04,895 --> 00:21:05,919
More attention

419
00:21:06,175 --> 00:21:08,223
Just be like her and never asked

420
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:10,015
Did go on RT

421
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:15,647
Aiden

422
00:21:15,903 --> 00:21:17,952
Gray isn't nothing there

423
00:21:18,976 --> 00:21:19,488
Joe

424
00:21:19,744 --> 00:21:20,512
CNN

425
00:21:20,768 --> 00:21:21,792
I would say it's

426
00:21:22,048 --> 00:21:23,328
Probably more Alex

427
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:24,352
To having

428
00:21:24,608 --> 00:21:25,632
Both naked selfie

429
00:21:25,888 --> 00:21:26,400
Pinterest

430
00:21:26,656 --> 00:21:27,680
And just

431
00:21:27,936 --> 00:21:29,984
His father's love

432
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:33,312
That's the dentist

433
00:21:33,568 --> 00:21:34,848
Jesus Father's Love

434
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,408
He's got great teeth but he doesn't have his dad

435
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:41,248
I don't think Alex himself is being investigated for anything

436
00:21:41,504 --> 00:21:44,576
He's done I believe that he is a piece of the event

437
00:21:44,832 --> 00:21:47,904
Navigation because his propaganda is being pushed by Russian

438
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:49,696
And I believe

439
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:53,280
From everything I've read that that is what the articles are about about

440
00:21:55,328 --> 00:21:57,120
Alex is turned

441
00:21:57,888 --> 00:21:58,912
I am being

442
00:21:59,168 --> 00:22:00,448
Call the Russian agent

443
00:22:00,704 --> 00:22:02,496
Bright

444
00:22:05,056 --> 00:22:06,336
For him to push because banners

445
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:08,128
That's

446
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:09,920
The argument from

447
00:22:10,176 --> 00:22:11,456
Even people on the left

448
00:22:15,808 --> 00:22:16,320
Like that

449
00:22:18,112 --> 00:22:18,624
Not

450
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:19,392
The story

451
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:21,184
He's not

452
00:22:22,464 --> 00:22:27,072
I don't think you should be shut down I just think we should walk him until he quit

453
00:22:28,864 --> 00:22:31,424
If he does do those things

454
00:22:32,704 --> 00:22:33,728
These are the reasons that I think

455
00:22:33,984 --> 00:22:34,496
People are attacking

456
00:22:35,008 --> 00:22:38,080
Cuz other ideas

457
00:22:54,976 --> 00:23:01,120
Hopes and dreams our society

458
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:09,568
Emergency martial law and a civil war

459
00:23:09,824 --> 00:23:15,968
Play calling for the cities to begin to me for the present

460
00:23:16,224 --> 00:23:21,088
Call military

461
00:23:21,344 --> 00:23:27,488
In Warfare against the Republic

462
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,656
And foreign policy

463
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:38,240
Global Publications

464
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,152
Calling for military coup against Trump

465
00:23:53,344 --> 00:23:54,368
Insurrection

466
00:23:55,904 --> 00:23:59,232
Military

467
00:23:59,488 --> 00:24:02,560
Mutiny and Rebellion

468
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:04,096
Citizens of this country

469
00:24:04,352 --> 00:24:05,120
Wait

470
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,448
But didn't

471
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:11,008
Say earlier that that was okay

472
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:14,336
Then he'd have long as they were as long as they were

473
00:24:15,104 --> 00:24:15,616
Look for

474
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:19,200
Yeah then doesn't mean

475
00:24:19,456 --> 00:24:20,992
Condemn the very thing that you

476
00:24:21,248 --> 00:24:21,760
He said was

477
00:24:22,016 --> 00:24:26,368
Perfectly fine months about how

478
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:29,184
Rogue forces within the CIA have

479
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,720
Perform to counter-coup

480
00:24:30,976 --> 00:24:31,744
Against liberal

481
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,048
We already had the counter counter

482
00:24:34,304 --> 00:24:37,120
We're in the middle of the counter countertop

483
00:24:37,376 --> 00:24:39,168
We're in the middle of the counter counter

484
00:24:40,192 --> 00:24:45,312
Cannot keep track of all these we might find it supposed to

485
00:24:45,568 --> 00:24:49,152
Can you code

486
00:24:49,408 --> 00:24:51,200
Flower pot

487
00:24:51,456 --> 00:24:53,248
All I can do

488
00:24:53,504 --> 00:24:54,784
Task math text

489
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:55,808
Every time there's a

490
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,928
Because Alex keeps talking about globalist

491
00:25:01,184 --> 00:25:01,952
Publications

492
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:03,232
I'm subscribed

493
00:25:03,488 --> 00:25:04,512
The foreign policy

494
00:25:07,584 --> 00:25:09,120
And I've started reading it

495
00:25:13,728 --> 00:25:16,032
I started reading all the time

496
00:25:16,288 --> 00:25:19,104
Okay

497
00:25:19,616 --> 00:25:20,128
Narrative

498
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:21,664
Is not in there

499
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:26,272
Is a very

500
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,720
But this article was

501
00:25:34,976 --> 00:25:36,512
We don't want to take a stand

502
00:25:36,768 --> 00:25:38,048
On whether or not

503
00:25:38,304 --> 00:25:38,816
He is

504
00:25:39,072 --> 00:25:39,584
Enough

505
00:25:40,352 --> 00:25:41,632
But what I can't do

506
00:25:41,888 --> 00:25:42,912
Is with you

507
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:44,192
His dissertation

508
00:25:44,704 --> 00:25:47,520
Oh-so the one word

509
00:25:48,032 --> 00:25:48,544
Probably

510
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:49,824
Espoused

511
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,360
No it's not

512
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:52,128
It's about

513
00:25:52,384 --> 00:25:52,896
Terrorism

514
00:25:53,152 --> 00:25:54,432
Counterterrorism

515
00:25:54,688 --> 00:25:55,712
GameStop

516
00:25:55,968 --> 00:25:56,736
Who is

517
00:25:57,248 --> 00:25:58,272
Doctoral advisor

518
00:25:58,784 --> 00:26:00,832
Reviewing people's dissertation

519
00:26:01,344 --> 00:26:03,136
We're just going on and on

520
00:26:03,904 --> 00:26:05,184
Talking taking the piss out of him

521
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,464
For lunch

522
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:07,232
Scholarly

523
00:26:07,744 --> 00:26:08,256
It was

524
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:10,816
The only sites like four sources

525
00:26:11,072 --> 00:26:12,608
Read many books

526
00:26:15,168 --> 00:26:16,192
He is one of Trump's

527
00:26:16,448 --> 00:26:18,240
Counterterrorism adviser

528
00:26:18,496 --> 00:26:19,520
Pretty high up there

529
00:26:20,032 --> 00:26:21,312
And you have no experience

530
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,896
And almost no published work outside of the dissertation

531
00:26:25,152 --> 00:26:25,920
About counter-terror

532
00:26:28,224 --> 00:26:29,248
Bad wrecks

533
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:31,040
What kind of stuff that's in foreign policy

534
00:26:31,296 --> 00:26:32,576
Very interesting

535
00:26:32,832 --> 00:26:33,344
Want like

536
00:26:35,904 --> 00:26:36,416
Look

Could be

538
00:26:40,768 --> 00:26:42,560
Wouldn't you wouldn't you want like a

539
00:26:43,584 --> 00:26:45,632
I think for an advisor position you wanted

540
00:26:45,888 --> 00:26:46,912
Especially for like

541
00:26:47,168 --> 00:26:48,192
Counter-terror

542
00:26:48,704 --> 00:26:51,776
When you're pretty hot topic

543
00:26:53,312 --> 00:26:57,152
Weirdo weirdo

544
00:26:57,408 --> 00:27:02,528
You're nothing is there it is you're not saying I do it

545
00:27:02,784 --> 00:27:06,112
Send my address

546
00:27:08,672 --> 00:27:10,976
This next clip

547
00:27:11,232 --> 00:27:11,744
Described as a

548
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,024
Is her next step

549
00:27:13,792 --> 00:27:14,304
Achieve

550
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:18,144
You guys want to get excited about what our next episodes going to be about it's a lot of this

551
00:27:18,656 --> 00:27:20,448
Good news

552
00:27:21,216 --> 00:27:23,008
And Justice look mean

553
00:27:28,896 --> 00:27:29,920
Is a huge narrative

554
00:27:30,176 --> 00:27:30,688
Fun for the

555
00:27:30,944 --> 00:27:32,224
The entirety of the last week

556
00:27:32,736 --> 00:27:33,248
Really

557
00:27:35,296 --> 00:27:35,808
Hi

558
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:36,832
Improve it

559
00:27:37,344 --> 00:27:42,976
And I'm going to next episode

560
00:27:44,512 --> 00:27:45,536
I found out where it came

561
00:27:46,048 --> 00:27:47,328
Oh s***

562
00:27:49,376 --> 00:27:49,888
Big

563
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,168
Music stuff

564
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:57,824
Next episode

565
00:28:02,944 --> 00:28:09,088
We're half hour in we're figuring our legs back again

566
00:28:09,344 --> 00:28:12,416
Read about it you know what it is I'm

567
00:28:12,672 --> 00:28:13,184
I'm getting

568
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:16,768
Insecure that people are going to turn this off because next episodes going to be

569
00:28:17,024 --> 00:28:18,560
You so great

570
00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:25,728
Like the stuff he's talking about

571
00:28:25,984 --> 00:28:27,008
Track from A to B

572
00:28:27,264 --> 00:28:29,312
There's just so much like all over the place

573
00:28:29,824 --> 00:28:30,336
Yeah he doesn't

574
00:28:30,592 --> 00:28:33,152
He doesn't have the kind of Border or maybe

575
00:28:33,408 --> 00:28:34,432
Maybe he's just not

576
00:28:34,688 --> 00:28:36,480
Capable of doing the longer narrative right

577
00:28:38,784 --> 00:28:39,808
So many different

578
00:28:40,064 --> 00:28:40,832
Angles right

579
00:28:41,088 --> 00:28:47,232
Narrative probably around an hour and a half into this

580
00:28:47,488 --> 00:28:53,632
1 hours

581
00:28:53,888 --> 00:28:58,240
Have you ever watched batteries

582
00:28:58,496 --> 00:28:59,776
I watched a lot of him

583
00:29:00,032 --> 00:29:00,544
How

584
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:01,824
Are you still alive

585
00:29:02,336 --> 00:29:03,104
Look

586
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:09,504
I used to do that now I see it there for locks on the door

587
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:12,576
Haven't gone outside

588
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:17,184
That's true

589
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:19,232
France versus Bam Bam

590
00:29:22,816 --> 00:29:24,096
Anyway

591
00:29:24,352 --> 00:29:26,144
The Obama Deception okay

592
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:29,472
I've watched

593
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,312
She brought back Matt Damon black

594
00:29:36,384 --> 00:29:38,944
Idris Elba

595
00:29:39,456 --> 00:29:41,248
That's my racist

596
00:29:41,504 --> 00:29:43,040
James Bond

597
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,088
Documentary

598
00:29:47,136 --> 00:29:47,904
Endgame

599
00:29:51,488 --> 00:29:52,000
Now

600
00:29:52,256 --> 00:29:52,768
That

601
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:58,656
I wish it was

602
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:03,264
This next clip

603
00:30:04,288 --> 00:30:04,800
Like

604
00:30:05,312 --> 00:30:05,824
Is undertale

605
00:30:06,592 --> 00:30:07,360
Don't enjoy

606
00:30:08,128 --> 00:30:13,248
Because

607
00:30:17,344 --> 00:30:23,488
Martial law

608
00:30:25,536 --> 00:30:26,560
The baby classified

609
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,632
Two years after it was created

610
00:30:36,032 --> 00:30:37,056
Spring cleanup

611
00:30:37,568 --> 00:30:38,336
Strangely enough

612
00:30:38,848 --> 00:30:43,456
He was created

613
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,808
Classified

614
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:48,832
2 years

615
00:30:49,088 --> 00:30:51,904
After they created the program created the program

616
00:30:52,416 --> 00:30:53,696
And then three years

617
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:54,720
After his

618
00:30:55,232 --> 00:30:56,256
Yes

619
00:30:56,768 --> 00:30:59,840
What using math what Alex Jones is say

620
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:01,120
Is that

621
00:31:02,656 --> 00:31:06,496
The entire program was his fault in the first place Alex Jones

622
00:31:07,008 --> 00:31:09,824
He just gave them an idea

623
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,616
He did the whole endgame like

624
00:31:11,872 --> 00:31:13,408
This is what

625
00:31:18,784 --> 00:31:20,320
Buried within that cooks

626
00:31:20,576 --> 00:31:21,088
Please

627
00:31:21,344 --> 00:31:22,624
Impossibility

628
00:31:23,136 --> 00:31:23,648
Then he

629
00:31:23,904 --> 00:31:24,416
Time machine

630
00:31:25,184 --> 00:31:26,976
Alright

631
00:31:30,048 --> 00:31:32,864
No impossibilities in our world

632
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:35,424
So unlikely

633
00:31:37,216 --> 00:31:40,544
Unlikely to be created the documentary year before that program

634
00:31:41,056 --> 00:31:42,080
I'll give you that

635
00:31:42,336 --> 00:31:43,616
Also unlikely

636
00:31:44,128 --> 00:31:45,408
The government creates

637
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:46,432
NM

638
00:31:46,688 --> 00:31:51,040
Games for Global enslavement program

639
00:31:51,296 --> 00:31:55,648
Years later

640
00:32:05,888 --> 00:32:08,704
Did bro we started

641
00:32:11,264 --> 00:32:17,408
Articles about Gorka

642
00:32:17,664 --> 00:32:18,432
They're going to start

643
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:25,088
Just talking directly to you and foreign policy articles Dan I'm telling you you're going to love

644
00:32:26,112 --> 00:32:26,880
Real talk

645
00:32:27,392 --> 00:32:28,672
I think that's what Alex

646
00:32:29,184 --> 00:32:30,464
Who's going

647
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:33,536
I hope it doesn't happen too because otherwise I got to move to

648
00:32:34,048 --> 00:32:35,328
Yeah

649
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:39,424
The government would be like

650
00:32:40,448 --> 00:32:41,472
Going to shut everything

651
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:44,288
Alright

652
00:32:44,544 --> 00:32:47,360
Head Start we got everything pretty much in place

653
00:32:47,616 --> 00:32:52,736
Just f****** declassify.

654
00:32:53,248 --> 00:32:53,760
Alright

655
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:54,784
So here's what

656
00:32:56,064 --> 00:32:56,576
Declare martial

657
00:32:58,112 --> 00:32:58,624
And then we're going

658
00:32:58,880 --> 00:32:59,392
To take over all the

659
00:33:00,928 --> 00:33:01,696
Cuz that's not where the pay

660
00:33:02,208 --> 00:33:03,744
Turner liberal

661
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:04,768
We got to kill.

662
00:33:06,304 --> 00:33:07,328
Exactly

663
00:33:09,376 --> 00:33:10,912
12in entire essay

664
00:33:11,168 --> 00:33:13,472
11b

665
00:33:17,056 --> 00:33:18,592
I meant years later though

666
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:19,872
You know what

667
00:33:21,664 --> 00:33:22,176
I don't think

668
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:26,272
On this one

669
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:28,064
How about we

670
00:33:28,576 --> 00:33:29,600
Tell everyone

671
00:33:29,856 --> 00:33:30,368
Ever that this

672
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:35,488
We want to be honest

673
00:33:35,744 --> 00:33:37,280
Like we all know the intelligent

674
00:33:37,536 --> 00:33:38,048
Community owl

675
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:44,704
Is that narrative just spun right there is more entertaining than

676
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:45,472
Global deception

677
00:33:46,752 --> 00:33:47,520
Enslavement whatever

678
00:33:48,032 --> 00:33:48,544
Alex's stoop

679
00:33:50,336 --> 00:33:52,384
How long is the documentary

680
00:33:53,152 --> 00:33:57,248
Logan long

681
00:33:57,504 --> 00:33:59,552
How do you say

682
00:33:59,808 --> 00:34:02,112
66 Titanic

683
00:34:02,624 --> 00:34:04,672
That's what I think

684
00:34:04,928 --> 00:34:06,208
Very people donate

685
00:34:06,464 --> 00:34:06,976
To the show

686
00:34:07,232 --> 00:34:13,120
What we should do is to

687
00:34:13,632 --> 00:34:14,400
Subscribe now

688
00:34:15,168 --> 00:34:16,192
2R man pills

689
00:34:16,448 --> 00:34:20,544
No no no pills but if people were to subscribe

690
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:23,360
We would do a wasted commentary

691
00:34:23,616 --> 00:34:25,408
Alex

692
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:28,224
A full-on mst3k Ohio

693
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,016
That because I think that might be fun

694
00:34:30,272 --> 00:34:31,040
Here's an idea

695
00:34:31,296 --> 00:34:31,808
Anyway

696
00:34:33,088 --> 00:34:33,856
It's time for a noose

697
00:34:34,112 --> 00:34:36,416
I don't know if you're ready for it

698
00:34:41,024 --> 00:34:47,168
I don't like how deep is a certain level of game tell you something

699
00:34:47,424 --> 00:34:50,496
I've seen stuff hardly anybody else's scene

700
00:34:51,264 --> 00:34:53,056
I've seen stuff

701
00:34:53,312 --> 00:34:56,128
Literally anybody ever seen

702
00:34:56,384 --> 00:34:57,920
Having the responsibility

703
00:34:58,176 --> 00:34:58,688
Of being

704
00:34:58,944 --> 00:34:59,456
The only

705
00:34:59,968 --> 00:35:00,736
Tyler in the world

706
00:35:06,112 --> 00:35:10,208
I'd like to fully say that I believe that he seen stuff that almost Nobody seen

707
00:35:10,464 --> 00:35:12,768
But that's because I think it's been in

708
00:35:14,304 --> 00:35:15,840
You seem very specific

709
00:35:16,096 --> 00:35:17,632
Like forgeries

710
00:35:18,912 --> 00:35:20,960
Isaac fraud

711
00:35:21,472 --> 00:35:23,008
Specifically targeted him

712
00:35:23,264 --> 00:35:24,032
Because they know he

713
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:24,800
We just believe

714
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:25,568
And not

715
00:35:25,824 --> 00:35:26,336
Just that

716
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:28,128
He has seen

717
00:35:29,664 --> 00:35:30,176
Future

718
00:35:30,944 --> 00:35:33,504
I'm going to tell right now

719
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:37,600
He has he has worked it out engineer

720
00:35:39,648 --> 00:35:40,160
Same thing man

721
00:35:40,416 --> 00:35:43,488
The government

722
00:35:43,744 --> 00:35:44,256
With both

723
00:35:44,512 --> 00:35:50,656
Create this program

724
00:35:50,912 --> 00:35:54,496
What an a****** I mean

725
00:35:54,752 --> 00:35:55,776
Fair enough

726
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:59,104
I'm not just here on are talking about this stuff

727
00:36:02,176 --> 00:36:07,040
Where are you where the computer itself

728
00:36:07,296 --> 00:36:13,440
You just Target the person

729
00:36:16,512 --> 00:36:19,840
Microscopic capacitors

730
00:36:27,008 --> 00:36:27,520
What

731
00:36:29,056 --> 00:36:31,104
Transfer over cable

732
00:36:31,872 --> 00:36:34,944
Andover wine

733
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:36,736
Is your scooping it all up

734
00:36:36,992 --> 00:36:37,760
He does not know what

735
00:36:38,016 --> 00:36:40,576
Any of this.

736
00:36:41,344 --> 00:36:44,416
He's number 15 gear stuff that they would start doing 9 years later

737
00:36:46,464 --> 00:36:52,608
Can't do no fifteen years the stuff that they're not doing

738
00:36:54,656 --> 00:36:57,728
Do you think that someone's microwave is listening to them

739
00:36:57,984 --> 00:37:04,128
Cuz there's chips inside them with little micro microphone why would you do that

740
00:37:04,384 --> 00:37:04,896
Microphone

741
00:37:05,152 --> 00:37:06,944
Everyone also hey bro

742
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:11,808
That would be cost prohibitive

743
00:37:12,064 --> 00:37:13,088
VIP

744
00:37:13,344 --> 00:37:18,720
Mighty micros

745
00:37:18,976 --> 00:37:19,744
Five Guys

746
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:27,424
With Mike and power washers of microphones on everything

747
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:32,032
Whenever they want to the government could remotely turn them on and start listening

748
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,592
But they can remotely turn on your phone

749
00:37:34,848 --> 00:37:36,896
Start listening to you through that right but this was

750
00:37:37,664 --> 00:37:39,200
6 years ago before cell phones

751
00:37:39,456 --> 00:37:44,320
My argument is falling apart

752
00:37:45,088 --> 00:37:45,600
That makes

753
00:37:45,856 --> 00:37:46,368
No sense

754
00:37:47,392 --> 00:37:48,672
How would you build a

755
00:37:48,928 --> 00:37:52,000
Microscopic microphone also that has a transmitter that

756
00:37:52,256 --> 00:37:54,304
I can send things to you also

757
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:56,608
Climatic

758
00:37:56,864 --> 00:37:59,168
The idea that like in your microwave

759
00:37:59,936 --> 00:38:01,216
Let's let's start

760
00:38:01,984 --> 00:38:04,032
The microphone in your mic

761
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:07,360
When you turn on your microwave

762
00:38:07,872 --> 00:38:09,152
Do that

763
00:38:09,408 --> 00:38:10,432
It makes a lot of noise

764
00:38:19,392 --> 00:38:20,160
But then

765
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:26,304
Classic classic knowledge fight

766
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:28,096
You're only going to get to hear what I say

767
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:32,192
Microphone

768
00:38:32,448 --> 00:38:33,216
In your TV

769
00:38:33,472 --> 00:38:34,496
Okay

770
00:38:35,008 --> 00:38:37,312
In your toaster

771
00:38:37,824 --> 00:38:38,848
In your blood

772
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:43,456
Okay old-timey type blender with those the crank

773
00:38:43,712 --> 00:38:49,856
I think back to The Farmhouse that you wished

774
00:38:50,112 --> 00:38:50,624
Call Lupe

775
00:38:51,136 --> 00:38:51,904
No electronics

776
00:38:53,952 --> 00:38:57,024
It might be that might be the only way for us to survive

777
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:58,048
Be safe hey

778
00:38:58,304 --> 00:39:02,144
You wouldn't even know that the empty because you couldn't see his

779
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:03,168
Documentary.

780
00:39:04,448 --> 00:39:04,960
Yeah

781
00:39:05,216 --> 00:39:05,984
It's a double-edged sword

782
00:39:06,496 --> 00:39:09,312
You killed either way you know you and I are millennials

783
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:10,592
You know that right

784
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:12,384
I've heard me a millennial

785
00:39:12,896 --> 00:39:13,664
Turns out the global stuff

786
00:39:14,432 --> 00:39:14,944
You know what

787
00:39:15,968 --> 00:39:16,992
People in other generation

788
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:18,272
Don't like us

789
00:39:18,528 --> 00:39:19,040
No it's

790
00:39:20,064 --> 00:39:20,832
It's strange

791
00:39:21,088 --> 00:39:23,136
Cuz one of them

792
00:39:23,392 --> 00:39:24,416
Do any other generation

793
00:39:24,928 --> 00:39:25,440
History that other

794
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:31,328
Never heard the same thing people said about us

795
00:39:31,584 --> 00:39:33,376
Apply to any other generation

796
00:39:33,888 --> 00:39:35,936
I will say this I don't think that other generation

797
00:39:36,192 --> 00:39:39,264
This specific charge

798
00:39:45,664 --> 00:39:48,480
Junior High

799
00:39:49,504 --> 00:39:55,648
Nnnn denote

800
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:11,008
Robots in town and then

801
00:40:12,544 --> 00:40:17,408
Chinese

802
00:40:17,664 --> 00:40:21,760
America is going to have

803
00:40:24,832 --> 00:40:29,696
Felicia bio-weapon

804
00:40:30,976 --> 00:40:32,256
After the kill 94

805
00:40:32,768 --> 00:40:35,072
Kill

806
00:40:41,728 --> 00:40:43,776
I have all the different groups variations breast up

807
00:40:46,336 --> 00:40:49,408
Who does that mutation play made there at the end he's kind of supporting

808
00:40:49,664 --> 00:40:50,432
Theory of evolution

809
00:40:50,944 --> 00:40:52,224
But

810
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:55,040
He's making an argument

811
00:40:57,344 --> 00:40:58,368
That no one has made

812
00:40:58,624 --> 00:41:01,184
Which is like

813
00:41:02,208 --> 00:41:03,488
White people are Ice Age mutants

814
00:41:03,744 --> 00:41:05,536
We all know this and he's like

815
00:41:08,352 --> 00:41:09,888
Talkin about

816
00:41:10,144 --> 00:41:12,704
There is a group called the five percent Nation Nations

817
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:13,984
Nation of gods and Earth

818
00:41:14,496 --> 00:41:15,264
Which is a shoot-off

819
00:41:17,568 --> 00:41:19,872
Africa Afrocentric

820
00:41:20,128 --> 00:41:23,968
They were Branch out of Malcolm X's church cuz I didn't think he was

821
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:27,040
Clarence 13x

822
00:41:27,552 --> 00:41:31,648
I like him a lot also known as putting cuz his words were so smooth

823
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:32,672
Okay

824
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:35,232
Future

825
00:41:38,048 --> 00:41:40,352
Assurance of the nation

826
00:41:40,608 --> 00:41:41,120
I've got the nerve

827
00:41:43,168 --> 00:41:44,448
Yeah you can hear it in a lot of their rap

828
00:41:44,704 --> 00:41:45,472
We talked about like

829
00:41:45,984 --> 00:41:48,800
Who's the guy that don't have a clue

830
00:41:49,056 --> 00:41:50,848
There's this references to the

831
00:41:52,128 --> 00:41:53,151
Fat religious group

832
00:41:53,407 --> 00:41:54,943
Throughout all of their their history

833
00:41:56,735 --> 00:41:59,039
The nation is based on the idea that

834
00:41:59,295 --> 00:42:00,319
Percent of population

835
00:42:00,575 --> 00:42:01,343
Knows the truth

836
00:42:01,855 --> 00:42:03,647
Wake up the population

837
00:42:04,159 --> 00:42:06,207
That is 85% the population

838
00:42:06,463 --> 00:42:08,255
Is deaf dumb and blind and doesn't know the truth

839
00:42:09,023 --> 00:42:10,815
Then there's ten per-cent of the population

840
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:12,351
The truth

841
00:42:12,607 --> 00:42:13,375
Julie seeks the train

842
00:42:13,887 --> 00:42:14,399
P85d

843
00:42:15,679 --> 00:42:17,471
We're outnumbered

844
00:42:17,727 --> 00:42:23,871
Are we are we are no know where bad is it is kind of

845
00:42:24,127 --> 00:42:26,943
Where are the 85

846
00:42:28,223 --> 00:42:29,759
Depends

847
00:42:30,015 --> 00:42:31,295
We could

848
00:42:33,087 --> 00:42:37,183
Depending on what we're doing is the original conception of the Cypress

849
00:42:37,439 --> 00:42:37,951
Set Nation

850
00:42:38,207 --> 00:42:38,975
Adair

851
00:42:39,231 --> 00:42:39,743
Believe

852
00:42:40,255 --> 00:42:42,815
The truth is 85% is deaf.

853
00:42:43,071 --> 00:42:44,351
Is that the black man is God

854
00:42:44,863 --> 00:42:46,655
Memes

855
00:42:46,911 --> 00:42:48,191
Arm leg leg arm head

856
00:42:48,703 --> 00:42:49,471
The composition of

857
00:42:49,727 --> 00:42:50,239
The black mat

858
00:42:52,031 --> 00:42:52,543
The Quiet Man

859
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:55,871
Arm leg leg arm head

860
00:42:56,127 --> 00:42:56,895
Via Allah

861
00:42:57,151 --> 00:42:58,431
That's what that means

862
00:42:59,199 --> 00:43:00,735
It's a it's a representation

863
00:43:00,991 --> 00:43:01,759
For your body

864
00:43:03,551 --> 00:43:05,087
But why would they use that word

865
00:43:05,855 --> 00:43:06,367
What do you meme

866
00:43:06,623 --> 00:43:07,391
Well isn't that a

867
00:43:08,415 --> 00:43:11,743
Repurposing of like Islamic beliefs

868
00:43:12,511 --> 00:43:14,559
William Burroughs really

869
00:43:14,815 --> 00:43:15,839
Yeah they aren't they are

870
00:43:18,655 --> 00:43:19,167
No

871
00:43:22,239 --> 00:43:26,847
I've done a lot of research into

872
00:43:27,103 --> 00:43:28,383
Esoteric

873
00:43:29,151 --> 00:43:31,967
As time has gone on they've gotten

874
00:43:32,479 --> 00:43:34,015
Liberalism to it

875
00:43:34,271 --> 00:43:35,039
And it's not so right

876
00:43:38,111 --> 00:43:39,647
And one of their beliefs are they held

877
00:43:39,903 --> 00:43:46,047
Was that people were created in a lab by an evil scientist named yakub

878
00:43:48,351 --> 00:43:49,887
Well not being plausible

879
00:43:50,143 --> 00:43:52,191
Does kind of explain why any

880
00:43:52,447 --> 00:43:53,215
Time you read a history

881
00:43:53,471 --> 00:43:54,239
Book

882
00:43:54,495 --> 00:43:55,007
You get

883
00:43:55,263 --> 00:43:56,031
To the statement

884
00:43:56,287 --> 00:43:58,079
And then the white man came you're like

885
00:43:59,103 --> 00:44:03,711
Well that's this is bad foreshadow kind of is the black nationalist

886
00:44:04,479 --> 00:44:08,319
Bent that I was about like white people being nice

887
00:44:08,831 --> 00:44:10,623
From

888
00:44:12,415 --> 00:44:14,463
Meet us in a lab

889
00:44:14,719 --> 00:44:15,231
Wayback

890
00:44:17,535 --> 00:44:21,631
Examples

891
00:44:21,887 --> 00:44:23,167
Of the type of

892
00:44:23,679 --> 00:44:24,703
So I'm just saying

893
00:44:24,959 --> 00:44:27,519
But it's not ignoring argument that he's arguing again

894
00:44:27,775 --> 00:44:30,079
It's just a very unpleasant on

895
00:44:31,103 --> 00:44:31,615
If a magnet

896
00:44:33,407 --> 00:44:34,431
Yeah so anyway

897
00:44:35,967 --> 00:44:36,735
Love you

898
00:44:39,551 --> 00:44:40,063
Done

899
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:43,135
I'm in feel 90%

900
00:44:43,391 --> 00:44:44,927
Then we release the Bayou

901
00:44:46,975 --> 00:44:47,487
Why would

902
00:44:47,743 --> 00:44:49,023
Would you do that after the 94

903
00:44:49,791 --> 00:44:52,607
Maybe the bioweapons wouldn't be effective

904
00:44:53,887 --> 00:44:54,399
I don't know

905
00:44:54,911 --> 00:44:55,423
I don't know

906
00:44:56,191 --> 00:44:59,007
I don't believe him

907
00:45:02,335 --> 00:45:06,687
I just want any kind of any kind

908
00:45:11,039 --> 00:45:12,319
Any kind of handle

909
00:45:12,575 --> 00:45:13,087
Because that makes

910
00:45:13,855 --> 00:45:14,367
Not just

911
00:45:14,623 --> 00:45:15,135
No sense

912
00:45:17,439 --> 00:45:18,207
Opposite

913
00:45:19,487 --> 00:45:22,303
Which all the Chinese greet all of them

914
00:45:22,559 --> 00:45:23,071
Okay

915
00:45:23,327 --> 00:45:27,679
Which jobs are onboard

916
00:45:28,191 --> 00:45:28,703
Cuz we're going to need it

917
00:45:28,959 --> 00:45:30,239
In the eventual court case

918
00:45:32,031 --> 00:45:33,055
History of humanity

919
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:36,639
Alex

920
00:45:36,895 --> 00:45:41,759
I wants to do a deep dive into analysis about the attack London

921
00:45:42,271 --> 00:45:43,039
That happened

922
00:45:43,807 --> 00:45:46,111
Eminem's last week

923
00:45:46,367 --> 00:45:46,879
He has nothing

924
00:45:47,391 --> 00:45:48,671
His hatred of Islam

925
00:45:57,119 --> 00:46:03,263
Run over a bunch of people instead

926
00:46:05,311 --> 00:46:09,407
Watching footage this morning online of just thousands of Muslim men

927
00:46:10,943 --> 00:46:17,087
Celebrate

928
00:46:18,623 --> 00:46:21,439
Like a horde of zombies

929
00:46:21,695 --> 00:46:26,559
I love you

930
00:46:26,815 --> 00:46:28,863
I'm guessing there what he saw was a bunch of like

931
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:29,631
B roll

932
00:46:29,887 --> 00:46:31,167
Rumba

933
00:46:31,423 --> 00:46:32,191
Can we find any

934
00:46:32,959 --> 00:46:33,471
I can't

935
00:46:33,983 --> 00:46:36,031
No

936
00:46:36,287 --> 00:46:36,799
Open

937
00:46:37,055 --> 00:46:39,103
Like

938
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:42,431
Yes like a like a primate thing going on there like

939
00:46:52,415 --> 00:46:53,695
Except for that movie

940
00:46:55,231 --> 00:46:59,327
I want

941
00:46:59,839 --> 00:47:02,399
I think it's interesting that Alex is so bent out of shape

942
00:47:02,655 --> 00:47:03,679
Compared

943
00:47:03,935 --> 00:47:06,239
How to how

944
00:47:06,751 --> 00:47:07,263
Which was

945
00:47:14,431 --> 00:47:14,943
But

946
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:16,991
That we move on

947
00:47:19,039 --> 00:47:20,319
Bills solution

948
00:47:21,343 --> 00:47:22,367
Something bad happen

949
00:47:22,879 --> 00:47:23,391
You know what

950
00:47:27,487 --> 00:47:31,327
Where is Alex's super into let's call them hotties and I really

951
00:47:31,583 --> 00:47:32,351
Demonize Islam

952
00:47:32,607 --> 00:47:37,215
Muslims were kind of making it seem like it

953
00:47:37,471 --> 00:47:43,615
It's a big all of them are happy

954
00:47:43,871 --> 00:47:44,895
If you see a thousand people

955
00:47:45,151 --> 00:47:45,663
People doing something

956
00:47:45,919 --> 00:47:47,199
Representative

957
00:47:47,455 --> 00:47:47,967
2 billion

958
00:47:48,479 --> 00:47:48,991
Everything

959
00:47:49,247 --> 00:47:53,599
Alex has still not apologize or recognize

960
00:47:54,111 --> 00:47:56,927
That that's

961
00:47:58,463 --> 00:48:01,023
He reported it that it wasn't Muslim I am

962
00:48:01,279 --> 00:48:02,815
Will not

963
00:48:04,351 --> 00:48:05,887
Okay so f*** him

964
00:48:06,143 --> 00:48:09,471
This gets back to our general Flynn

965
00:48:09,727 --> 00:48:10,495
Situation where

966
00:48:11,263 --> 00:48:15,359
That now there's blood General

00:48:15,615 --> 00:48:16,383
Wednesday

968
00:48:17,407 --> 00:48:22,015
River General

969
00:48:22,271 --> 00:48:22,783
People in what they

970
00:48:23,039 --> 00:48:23,807
Okay

971
00:48:24,063 --> 00:48:25,855
No it does the blood in the water

972
00:48:26,111 --> 00:48:26,623
Right

973
00:48:26,879 --> 00:48:27,903
So once we

974
00:48:28,159 --> 00:48:29,183
Once we got one

975
00:48:30,207 --> 00:48:32,511
Person down now we're going after more and more and more right

976
00:48:32,767 --> 00:48:33,279
What's

977
00:48:33,535 --> 00:48:35,071
We get one Alex Jones apology

978
00:48:35,583 --> 00:48:38,911
It's all coming down

979
00:48:39,935 --> 00:48:40,447
I'm hoping

980
00:48:40,703 --> 00:48:41,471
That would be

981
00:48:41,727 --> 00:48:44,031
Amazing free episode

982
00:48:44,543 --> 00:48:50,687
I don't think we do world for everything you should apologize

983
00:48:50,943 --> 00:48:52,223
For we would be long dead

984
00:48:52,479 --> 00:48:52,991
Before we covered it

985
00:48:56,063 --> 00:48:56,831
For 23 years

986
00:48:59,135 --> 00:49:04,511
Bf1

987
00:49:05,023 --> 00:49:06,047
April

988
00:49:06,559 --> 00:49:07,583
4th episode

989
00:49:08,351 --> 00:49:09,887
Just a long series

990
00:49:10,399 --> 00:49:16,543
I would love that. Great present if Alex Jones just apologized for an entire show

991
00:49:16,799 --> 00:49:20,639
Attack

992
00:49:21,663 --> 00:49:22,175
Well I can only be

993
00:49:22,431 --> 00:49:24,223
Describe is like a super scientific

994
00:49:24,479 --> 00:49:24,991
Approach

995
00:49:25,503 --> 00:49:26,015
2

996
00:49:26,271 --> 00:49:26,783
Beano's

997
00:49:27,039 --> 00:49:27,551
Tistic

998
00:49:28,319 --> 00:49:29,087
Figuring out what

999
00:49:29,343 --> 00:49:30,367
What's going on I don't

1000
00:49:31,391 --> 00:49:33,439
Zero's official

1001
00:49:35,743 --> 00:49:39,327
On Facebook as opposed to that emojis

1002
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:42,655
Emoji

1003
00:49:45,215 --> 00:49:48,031
Every frowny face

1004
00:49:48,287 --> 00:49:52,383
Smiley faces on for hours

1005
00:49:53,151 --> 00:49:54,175
And for every

1006
00:49:54,431 --> 00:49:55,455
Thumbs down

1007
00:50:00,063 --> 00:50:00,831
Not one

1008
00:50:01,087 --> 00:50:03,391
Thumbs down thumbs up baby

1009
00:50:03,903 --> 00:50:05,439
Thumbs up

1010
00:50:05,695 --> 00:50:07,999
For every frowny face

1011
00:50:09,535 --> 00:50:10,815
10 smiley face

1012
00:50:11,071 --> 00:50:17,215
So you know how when you're broadcasting live on Facebook it shows the like responses cascading across the screen

1013
00:50:17,727 --> 00:50:20,543
Here's a screenshot of a lot of like happy faces

1014
00:50:20,799 --> 00:50:22,079
Covering the London attack

1015
00:50:22,335 --> 00:50:23,103
Now

1016
00:50:23,615 --> 00:50:27,967
One of the things that doesn't take into account is the things like Fortune

1017
00:50:28,223 --> 00:50:33,343
Can we play that one more time I want to hear that you wait for the episode

1018
00:50:37,183 --> 00:50:38,207
Those times

1019
00:50:38,975 --> 00:50:39,999
If Morgan Freeman

1020
00:50:40,255 --> 00:50:41,279
Did that ever

1021
00:50:41,791 --> 00:50:44,607
He does not recognize that there are internet Brigade

1022
00:50:45,631 --> 00:50:46,399
Patrol thing

1023
00:50:46,911 --> 00:50:49,727
Yes and I would not be super surprised I've no ever

1024
00:50:50,239 --> 00:50:52,799
I wouldn't be surprised if there were a bunch of people

1025
00:50:53,055 --> 00:50:54,335
Who put on a message board

1026
00:50:54,591 --> 00:50:59,711
Let's all go Brigade this al-jazeera report and make it look like everyone

1027
00:51:02,527 --> 00:51:03,551
Motion passes

1028
00:51:04,063 --> 00:51:07,135
But anyway

1029
00:51:08,671 --> 00:51:14,047
I don't I don't know like I can't prove if that's true I'm not going to pour over Message Board history is to

1030
00:51:14,303 --> 00:51:18,143
Define

1031
00:51:18,399 --> 00:51:19,423
Charge of the internet

1032
00:51:19,935 --> 00:51:21,215
Who

1033
00:51:21,727 --> 00:51:23,519
Brigading the internet

1034
00:51:24,031 --> 00:51:28,127
That's right out for you basically what you have there is

1035
00:51:28,383 --> 00:51:29,151
Plausible

1036
00:51:29,663 --> 00:51:32,223
Explanation for why that might be the case outside of

1037
00:51:32,735 --> 00:51:34,527
Alex's argument which is almost

1038
00:51:35,039 --> 00:51:35,551
Super thrilled

1039
00:51:37,343 --> 00:51:38,367
Yeah I don't think that's true

1040
00:51:38,623 --> 00:51:42,975
And I don't think you can prove it those smiley faces were coming from Muslim people you dumb f***

1041
00:51:48,863 --> 00:51:50,655
Is there any could you imagine

1042
00:51:50,911 --> 00:51:52,191
Anyway

1043
00:51:52,703 --> 00:51:53,215
Prove that

1044
00:51:53,983 --> 00:51:54,495
Black Annie

1045
00:51:54,751 --> 00:51:55,519
Possible

1046
00:51:56,543 --> 00:52:02,687
Not within Alex Jones is sort of investigative journalism techniques metaphorically.

1047
00:52:04,991 --> 00:52:06,015
Putting together a full

1048
00:52:06,783 --> 00:52:07,295
History of each other

1049
00:52:07,807 --> 00:52:12,927
Style

1050
00:52:13,183 --> 00:52:14,463
To figure that s*** out of definitely

1051
00:52:14,719 --> 00:52:17,791
Because I know he goes

1052
00:52:18,047 --> 00:52:22,399
The temple five times a day to pray

1053
00:52:23,679 --> 00:52:25,471
Time to get to this interview

1054
00:52:25,727 --> 00:52:27,263
Where everything takes a turn

1055
00:52:29,055 --> 00:52:29,823
Is an interview

1056
00:52:30,079 --> 00:52:31,615
With one

1057
00:52:32,639 --> 00:52:38,783
Really believe in Sandy Hook

1058
00:52:39,807 --> 00:52:40,319
He's a bad person

1059
00:52:40,575 --> 00:52:43,647
He's the guy who's responsible for the counter-coup narrative

1060
00:52:43,903 --> 00:52:44,415
Butt out

1061
00:52:44,671 --> 00:52:45,695
Has been pitching for about the last

1062
00:52:47,743 --> 00:52:49,279
A lot of red flags on

1063
00:52:51,071 --> 00:52:52,863
Lot of more than more than

1064
00:52:53,119 --> 00:52:56,191
Yeah but I want to say

1065
00:52:56,447 --> 00:52:57,215
No

1066
00:52:57,471 --> 00:52:58,751
Today

1067
00:53:01,823 --> 00:53:02,335
Alright

1068
00:53:02,591 --> 00:53:04,127
His interview

1069
00:53:04,639 --> 00:53:06,431
He's trying to make two points

1070
00:53:07,711 --> 00:53:09,759
Power login

1071
00:53:10,015 --> 00:53:10,527
Basically

1072
00:53:10,783 --> 00:53:13,087
Gotcha

1073
00:53:13,599 --> 00:53:15,647
Owls Head was at

1074
00:53:16,159 --> 00:53:17,951
When the interview was about to start

1075
00:53:18,207 --> 00:53:19,743
I'm going to play his introduction

1076
00:53:21,791 --> 00:53:22,303
Steve pieczenik

1077
00:53:23,327 --> 00:53:23,839
And then

1078
00:53:25,887 --> 00:53:27,167
He'd like to talk about

1079
00:53:28,447 --> 00:53:29,215
I will see how that go

1080
00:53:39,967 --> 00:53:46,111
Cam

1081
00:53:47,135 --> 00:53:50,719
On the confirmation hearings going on

1082
00:53:50,975 --> 00:53:53,535
When I got to say this judge the tub

1083
00:53:53,791 --> 00:53:56,095
Nominative I buy promises destroying them

1084
00:53:56,351 --> 00:53:58,655
Now we got Nunez admitting intelligence reading

1085
00:54:06,079 --> 00:54:08,895
I am so much more in the latest Islamic attack

1086
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:11,967
Which they're saying it's an Islamic attack

1087
00:54:12,479 --> 00:54:15,295
So we'll see where all that's going

1088
00:54:15,807 --> 00:54:18,623
Again calling for martial law National Emergency

1089
00:54:18,879 --> 00:54:22,719
I remember

1090
00:54:22,975 --> 00:54:25,535
Going around again trying to organize a coup against Trump

1091
00:54:25,791 --> 00:54:29,119
Here's the deal

1092
00:54:31,679 --> 00:54:36,543
Mister anti-bully State girl

1093
00:54:38,591 --> 00:54:40,895
And I just

1094
00:54:41,663 --> 00:54:43,199
Just some people call you Maurice

1095
00:54:47,551 --> 00:54:50,623
Doing something wrong

1096
00:54:50,879 --> 00:54:57,023
Run around

1097
00:54:57,279 --> 00:54:58,815
Alex Jones

1098
00:55:01,375 --> 00:55:04,447
Nope

1099
00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:11,103
So this point he's

1100
00:55:11,359 --> 00:55:12,639
Tried to do the introduction

1101
00:55:13,407 --> 00:55:19,551
He's lit not going well he's listed a couple he wants to Michael Moore's a flog

1102
00:55:19,807 --> 00:55:25,183
Gorsuch is cool

1103
00:55:25,439 --> 00:55:31,583
Running around Keith Wallen for the murder Trump

1104
00:55:31,839 --> 00:55:32,863
He's doing an introduction

1105
00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:35,167
Steve pieczenik

1106
00:55:35,423 --> 00:55:39,263
Is on Skype just staring

1107
00:55:39,519 --> 00:55:40,287
I am

1108
00:55:41,055 --> 00:55:47,199
Doctor if you're a regular Alex Jones

1109
00:55:47,455 --> 00:55:51,039
One word every 45 minutes do you have to serve

1110
00:55:51,295 --> 00:55:55,391
If you're mad at him or expectations

1111
00:55:55,903 --> 00:55:58,207
End up a little bit ago on his show a lot

1112
00:55:58,463 --> 00:56:00,255
Therapeutics like

1113
00:56:00,767 --> 00:56:03,071
Counterexample because one of them

1114
00:56:03,583 --> 00:56:05,631
Which is why this interview is fascinate

1115
00:56:05,887 --> 00:56:08,703
Usually someone who Alex

1116
00:56:08,959 --> 00:56:10,751
Gives a lot of difference

1117
00:56:11,007 --> 00:56:12,543
Kissing

1118
00:56:13,055 --> 00:56:13,567
As opposed to

1119
00:56:13,823 --> 00:56:15,103
Eddie Bravo

1120
00:56:15,359 --> 00:56:16,383
Who who just gets

1121
00:56:17,151 --> 00:56:17,663
Just get some

1122
00:56:27,647 --> 00:56:30,207
And now we have the federal license tuition Centre looking at

1123
00:56:30,719 --> 00:56:32,255
Trying to go out for Drudge Report

1124
00:56:37,631 --> 00:56:38,655
And yes this was

1125
00:56:38,911 --> 00:56:41,727
Regime-change

1126
00:56:42,751 --> 00:56:46,079
And they're just moving forward

1127
00:56:51,455 --> 00:56:55,551
Washington Post

1128
00:56:55,807 --> 00:56:59,903
Vine

1129
00:57:05,023 --> 00:57:11,167
Also harvard-educated

1130
00:57:20,383 --> 00:57:24,223
At the end there is what Alex thinks

1131
00:57:24,991 --> 00:57:26,527
With the intelligence

1132
00:57:28,575 --> 00:57:29,343
Anywhere near

1133
00:57:29,599 --> 00:57:33,439
But that's the way he can twist it in his head to make Trump look at

1134
00:57:33,695 --> 00:57:34,207
And feel smart

1135
00:57:34,463 --> 00:57:38,303
Right where he's like was just trolling the whole time

1136
00:57:38,559 --> 00:57:41,375
I like I like the I like his narrative

1137
00:57:42,143 --> 00:57:43,423
It is a regime change

1138
00:57:43,679 --> 00:57:45,215
It's happening all over the world

1139
00:57:45,727 --> 00:57:47,007
And they're acting like it

1140
00:57:47,775 --> 00:57:48,543
Like they don't care

1141
00:57:51,103 --> 00:57:54,943
So what is it is it really hurt nobody cares

1142
00:57:55,199 --> 00:57:58,015
You're still just acting like everything's

1143
00:58:00,575 --> 00:58:02,623
Like

1144
00:58:03,135 --> 00:58:05,951
Whatever mubarek was kicked out and they were just like

1145
00:58:06,463 --> 00:58:06,975
Okay

1146
00:58:07,231 --> 00:58:10,047
You know what we'll do we'll kick out this military dictator

1147
00:58:11,071 --> 00:58:13,887
Who cares will put in the new military dictator

1148
00:58:14,143 --> 00:58:15,423
That's not a receipt

1149
00:58:15,679 --> 00:58:16,191
No

1150
00:58:16,447 --> 00:58:16,959
Not really

1151
00:58:17,215 --> 00:58:20,799
No idea of a regime change

1152
00:58:21,311 --> 00:58:22,335
Against the globalist

1153
00:58:23,103 --> 00:58:25,407
In reality what it is is a

1154
00:58:25,663 --> 00:58:26,687
Very dangerous

1155
00:58:26,943 --> 00:58:27,967
Strain of nationalism

1156
00:58:28,735 --> 00:58:30,783
That is popping up in a lot of countries

1157
00:58:31,039 --> 00:58:32,575
And is largely being

1158
00:58:33,087 --> 00:58:36,159
Speeded and helps grow by for effort

1159
00:58:36,927 --> 00:58:37,695
The taken on by the Russian

1160
00:58:39,743 --> 00:58:42,303
What's going on

1161
00:58:42,559 --> 00:58:43,839
A fight against the globalist

1162
00:58:44,863 --> 00:58:47,167
I wouldn't say that it's entirely

1163
00:58:47,423 --> 00:58:50,239
That like there's that there's a whole lot of factors that could have gone in

1164
00:58:50,495 --> 00:58:54,591
To the riser for threatening assist

1165
00:58:54,847 --> 00:58:55,615
Goodbye

1166
00:58:55,871 --> 00:58:59,199
Yes. You do see the fingerprints

1167
00:59:00,223 --> 00:59:03,807
Russian Marine Le Pen

1168
00:59:04,063 --> 00:59:06,111
Meeting with Putin openly the other day

1169
00:59:11,743 --> 00:59:16,095
What does positive

1170
00:59:16,351 --> 00:59:17,887
Like

1171
00:59:18,143 --> 00:59:22,239
Far-right

1172
00:59:22,495 --> 00:59:26,079
Just goes to meet with punt with Putin

1173
00:59:31,199 --> 00:59:35,295
As a fight against as I've made clear

1174
00:59:35,807 --> 00:59:37,599
Globalization is a real thing

1175
00:59:37,855 --> 00:59:38,879
Globalist

1176
00:59:39,391 --> 00:59:41,439
Right so he's fighting against

1177
00:59:41,695 --> 00:59:43,231
Or hit his idea is

1178
00:59:43,743 --> 00:59:45,791
Against a non-existent force

1179
00:59:46,047 --> 00:59:47,327
What he's actually doing

1180
00:59:47,583 --> 00:59:48,863
Is holding water

1181
00:59:50,143 --> 00:59:53,727
Giving cover essentially to this rise of dangerous man

1182
00:59:55,775 --> 00:59:58,335
And if you get this way we're going to live in nightmares

1183
00:59:59,103 --> 01:00:01,151
Yeah but

1184
01:00:01,407 --> 01:00:02,943
For what we live in now

1185
01:00:03,455 --> 01:00:05,503
Comparable

1186
01:00:05,759 --> 01:00:06,271
That's a good point

1187
01:00:09,855 --> 01:00:15,999
We did get one on the board even if that nightmare scape does come to pass

1188
01:00:16,255 --> 01:00:17,023
I could be down the road

1189
01:00:17,535 --> 01:00:18,559
The good news is

1190
01:00:19,071 --> 01:00:19,839
The globalist

1191
01:00:20,095 --> 01:00:21,119
Will not be in charge

1192
01:00:22,399 --> 01:00:23,423
Because they're not now

1193
01:00:25,727 --> 01:00:29,311
It's super Sculpey

1194
01:00:29,823 --> 01:00:32,895
We're probably looking at our six or seven

1195
01:00:33,151 --> 01:00:33,919
Oh yeah

1196
01:00:34,175 --> 01:00:34,943
Navigate

1197
01:00:36,735 --> 01:00:38,271
We're playing

1198
01:00:38,783 --> 01:00:39,807
All it is is just like

1199
01:00:40,063 --> 01:00:41,599
Hating the idea of liberalism

1200
01:00:42,879 --> 01:00:43,647
Conservative liberal to my

1201
01:00:44,415 --> 01:00:46,207
That's all that's all it is

1202
01:00:47,743 --> 01:00:48,511
Why does he hate

1203
01:00:49,279 --> 01:00:52,095
Is there a

1204
01:00:52,351 --> 01:00:53,375
2A route

1205
01:00:54,143 --> 01:00:54,655
Why

1206
01:00:54,911 --> 01:00:57,983
Well one of the things is that he thinks that liberals want to take your gun

1207
01:00:58,239 --> 01:01:03,359
Let's definitely get used

1208
01:01:03,871 --> 01:01:10,015
Like this is all about personal Liberty

1209
01:01:10,271 --> 01:01:11,807
Real liberals want to enforce it

1210
01:01:12,063 --> 01:01:16,671
21

1211
01:01:18,207 --> 01:01:21,023
Other than it being terrible

1212
01:01:21,279 --> 01:01:24,863
If agenda21 if we're talkin about the actual un

1213
01:01:25,119 --> 01:01:27,423
Suggestions

1214
01:01:27,935 --> 01:01:29,215
I don't think that a lot of those too

1215
01:01:29,471 --> 01:01:30,239
Suggestions are bad

1216
01:01:33,311 --> 01:01:38,175
Version that's in Alex's head

1217
01:01:38,431 --> 01:01:40,479
We need the Jedi

1218
01:01:41,503 --> 01:01:42,271
No I really like it

1219
01:01:43,295 --> 01:01:48,415
Who cares

1220
01:01:48,671 --> 01:01:50,207
I will say I have time just

1221
01:01:50,463 --> 01:01:51,231
Cuz I had to cut out some

1222
01:01:51,487 --> 01:01:53,279
Some stuff it's too long for us to listen to all of it

1223
01:01:55,071 --> 01:01:57,119
Where that Neil Gorsuch is a neocon

1224
01:01:57,375 --> 01:01:59,167
It should never be put on the spur

1225
01:01:59,423 --> 01:02:00,447
Supreme Court

1226
01:02:00,703 --> 01:02:06,847
Yep I like that a lot. That's really good

1227
01:02:09,663 --> 01:02:10,175
Is

1228
01:02:10,431 --> 01:02:14,271
That information should be allowed to take over

1229
01:02:16,831 --> 01:02:19,391
Play that's the second point is

1230
01:02:20,927 --> 01:02:24,511
It also has to do with a neocon what-have-you but they are

1231
01:02:24,767 --> 01:02:28,607
Go to war with North Korea

1232
01:02:29,119 --> 01:02:30,911
Yes I also agree with him on that count

1233
01:02:31,167 --> 01:02:34,239
Wow so anyway here's the introductions

1234
01:02:34,495 --> 01:02:36,031
There's the introduction of Steve pieczenik Bremer

1235
01:02:43,711 --> 01:02:49,087
As you know we were successful

1236
01:02:49,343 --> 01:02:53,951
Michael

1237
01:03:03,679 --> 01:03:09,823
In the states

1238
01:03:10,079 --> 01:03:16,223
Nobody

1239
01:03:16,479 --> 01:03:18,271
Corporation

1240
01:03:18,527 --> 01:03:23,647
Call Burrell

1241
01:03:55,391 --> 01:04:00,511
Scrub and truck canopy

1242
01:04:00,767 --> 01:04:06,911
Dianne Feinstein

1243
01:04:46,079 --> 01:04:46,847
I know you don't

1244
01:05:01,951 --> 01:05:05,535
Million men

1245
01:05:07,839 --> 01:05:10,143
Away from Stowe

1246
01:05:20,127 --> 01:05:25,759
North Korean

1247
01:05:32,415 --> 01:05:35,231
North Korea

1248
01:05:37,791 --> 01:05:40,863
Try something

1249
01:05:44,191 --> 01:05:50,335
Alex remember

1250
01:05:50,591 --> 01:05:54,175
Plan

1251
01:05:54,943 --> 01:05:55,967
You know what just happened there

1252
01:05:56,223 --> 01:05:56,991
Steve pieczenik

1253
01:05:57,247 --> 01:05:59,295
You're an idiot

1254
01:05:59,551 --> 01:06:00,831
You're fuking idiot hours

1255
01:06:02,623 --> 01:06:03,391
You know

1256
01:06:03,647 --> 01:06:04,927
You know I've been

1257
01:06:05,183 --> 01:06:06,975
In the business of nuclear

1258
01:06:07,231 --> 01:06:07,999
Deterrence

1259
01:06:08,255 --> 01:06:10,303
The big part of nuclear deterrence is

1260
01:06:11,583 --> 01:06:13,887
Kill millions of people

1261
01:06:14,911 --> 01:06:16,191
When Alex was starting this

1262
01:06:16,447 --> 01:06:17,983
He introduced these premises

1263
01:06:18,239 --> 01:06:23,615
Is awesome he's going to get confirmed

1264
01:06:23,871 --> 01:06:25,151
One of God I hope not

1265
01:06:25,407 --> 01:06:25,919
What if

1266
01:06:26,175 --> 01:06:26,943
Text Bane point

1267
01:06:27,199 --> 01:06:27,967
Is the exact opposite

1268
01:06:28,223 --> 01:06:32,063
Because Alex has built as this hero

1269
01:06:32,831 --> 01:06:37,695
And this great source of interventions

1270
01:06:40,767 --> 01:06:46,655
Interrupt him and steer the conversation in a different direction

1271
01:06:46,911 --> 01:06:49,471
Right it's a

1272
01:06:49,727 --> 01:06:50,495
No

1273
01:06:51,775 --> 01:06:54,847
I'm sorry we're not on the same wavelength

1274
01:06:59,199 --> 01:07:00,223
Keeps going

1275
01:07:00,735 --> 01:07:01,503
Edit ants

1276
01:07:02,015 --> 01:07:03,551
So f***** up

1277
01:07:05,343 --> 01:07:11,487
I'm not going to carry any water for Steve pieczenik

1278
01:07:12,767 --> 01:07:15,839
I think built into some of the reasons that people use

1279
01:07:17,887 --> 01:07:18,655
Don't

1280
01:07:20,191 --> 01:07:20,703
It's for the right

1281
01:07:20,959 --> 01:07:27,103
Conclusion I disagree with but let's not split hairs

1282
01:07:28,639 --> 01:07:31,455
Is North Korea going

1283
01:07:31,711 --> 01:07:34,527
Going to take that bluff

1284
01:07:37,343 --> 01:07:43,231
I don't know careers not interested in

1285
01:07:43,487 --> 01:07:46,559
What North Korea will do what's best for North Korea

1286
01:07:46,815 --> 01:07:50,655
Our preparation has

1287
01:07:50,911 --> 01:07:57,055
How to deal with North Korea with other countries

1288
01:08:10,879 --> 01:08:17,023
Bulshit

1289
01:08:17,279 --> 01:08:21,119
Be clear throughout this entire interview you can see Steve pieczenik

1290
01:08:21,375 --> 01:08:22,143
Continuing to talk

1291
01:08:22,399 --> 01:08:23,167
Scarlet Spider

1292
01:08:23,423 --> 01:08:27,519
Michael has Mike

1293
01:08:27,775 --> 01:08:30,079
The cut-offs bike

1294
01:08:30,335 --> 01:08:31,103
A sense of like

1295
01:08:32,127 --> 01:08:33,919
What almost a frustration

1296
01:08:34,175 --> 01:08:34,943
A look of

1297
01:08:36,479 --> 01:08:38,271
Like you can see in his face

1298
01:08:38,527 --> 01:08:42,367
That he is not on board with what's going on with trying to make the best of it

1299
01:08:43,391 --> 01:08:45,695
I don't think I'm reading too much into this

1300
01:08:46,975 --> 01:08:49,791
I think Alex might have like

1301
01:08:50,303 --> 01:08:52,607
Offended wow we're really getting into like

1302
01:08:52,863 --> 01:08:59,007
Some some solid schisms in between Alex Jones and literally everybody who likes out

1303
01:08:59,263 --> 01:09:00,543
For the last

1304
01:09:00,799 --> 01:09:03,871
It's like year and a half or so Steve has been

1305
01:09:04,127 --> 01:09:05,919
The source of information for Alex

1306
01:09:06,175 --> 01:09:08,223
And there's been a Groot

1307
01:09:08,479 --> 01:09:09,759
Kind of relationship

1308
01:09:11,807 --> 01:09:17,695
It's not the competition is not but I think that I think if there is a part of this where Steve is trying to make

1309
01:09:17,951 --> 01:09:18,975
Some point that he wants

1310
01:09:19,231 --> 01:09:19,743
To get through.

1311
01:09:20,255 --> 01:09:22,047
He realizes that Alex is Off The Rez

1312
01:09:22,559 --> 01:09:25,887
Yeah like I think he realizes no Alex you have your own

1313
01:09:26,143 --> 01:09:26,655
Point

1314
01:09:26,911 --> 01:09:29,215
You don't just believe the things I want you

1315
01:09:31,007 --> 01:09:32,287
Yeah translator

1316
01:09:32,543 --> 01:09:35,103
Want to talk more about the neocon

1317
01:09:36,383 --> 01:09:36,895
Clip

1318
01:09:37,407 --> 01:09:40,223
Really illustrates

1319
01:09:40,735 --> 01:09:46,879
Just remind everybody created

1320
01:09:48,927 --> 01:09:52,511
We can walk away like everybody

1321
01:09:53,279 --> 01:09:56,095
The project for a New American Century ship

1322
01:10:00,447 --> 01:10:06,591
Terrible

1323
01:10:06,847 --> 01:10:07,871
Wipeout 9%

1324
01:10:08,127 --> 01:10:08,639
Chinese people

1325
01:10:09,663 --> 01:10:14,527
Earlier episode

1326
01:10:14,783 --> 01:10:15,807
It's important

1327
01:10:16,063 --> 01:10:17,855
Alright

1328
01:10:18,111 --> 01:10:18,879
Illustrates

1329
01:10:19,135 --> 01:10:19,647
Alex Jones

1330
01:10:19,903 --> 01:10:20,671
Is f****** out of his League

1331
01:10:21,183 --> 01:10:22,207
In this conversation

1332
01:10:24,255 --> 01:10:25,023
He's out of his depth

1333
01:10:25,535 --> 01:10:27,583
There's not a good

1334
01:10:28,607 --> 01:10:30,911
Because he already knew half of

1335
01:10:44,479 --> 01:10:48,063
It's just as soon as Trump let us run Tang

1336
01:10:48,319 --> 01:10:52,415
Information that they are

1337
01:10:52,671 --> 01:10:55,999
Nana Nana Nana. Crazy

1338
01:10:56,511 --> 01:11:00,351
I mean what you know about Pearl

1339
01:11:03,167 --> 01:11:04,703
And the women run from them as if

1340
01:11:04,959 --> 01:11:09,567
Women want to go to walk up and go I'm a murderer I kill people that don't want to want

1341
01:11:14,175 --> 01:11:20,319
Mustache

1342
01:11:22,367 --> 01:11:23,391
So he's mute

1343
01:11:23,903 --> 01:11:26,975
Yeah

1344
01:11:28,255 --> 01:11:31,839
Yeah

1345
01:11:32,095 --> 01:11:34,399
I don't know who

1346
01:11:34,911 --> 01:11:39,007
I'm Hellboy and that's good enough right

1347
01:11:39,263 --> 01:11:42,335
No mechanic wants to talk policy

1348
01:11:43,871 --> 01:11:46,687
No Alex

1349
01:11:46,943 --> 01:11:47,967
John Bolton's mustache

1350
01:11:50,015 --> 01:11:51,039
Policy

1351
01:11:53,599 --> 01:11:56,927
Paul Ryan School of policy walk

1352
01:11:57,183 --> 01:11:57,951
Being a f******

1353
01:11:58,975 --> 01:12:00,511
Who's Steve gets back in here

1354
01:12:36,351 --> 01:12:41,983
No one will appoint who he says everyone

1355
01:12:42,495 --> 01:12:44,287
There's a total mute

1356
01:12:44,543 --> 01:12:50,687
Office

1357
01:12:52,735 --> 01:12:55,295
Directions

1358
01:13:03,231 --> 01:13:07,071
Your mama's so fat the Russians wouldn't

1359
01:13:07,327 --> 01:13:10,655
I'm kind of fine with that answer though

1360
01:13:10,911 --> 01:13:12,191
From hell

1361
01:13:12,447 --> 01:13:13,215
Probably the

1362
01:13:13,727 --> 01:13:16,543
True answer I don't think the Russians are feeding Alex Jones

1363
01:13:20,895 --> 01:13:23,199
He's an ally that they don't even have to

1364
01:13:23,455 --> 01:13:29,599
No like other people you got to convince and they went a dramatic

1365
01:13:30,111 --> 01:13:32,415
I'm so happy

1366
01:13:32,927 --> 01:13:34,719
Lucky idiot

1367
01:13:39,327 --> 01:13:42,399
Getting into the circumstances

1368
01:13:42,655 --> 01:13:43,167
We are now

1369
01:13:43,423 --> 01:13:47,519
Because before Alex had any real world relevance

1370
01:13:48,031 --> 01:13:52,383
He could get away with saying anything

1371
01:13:53,919 --> 01:13:54,943
Attention which is

1372
01:13:55,455 --> 01:13:56,223
On its own

1373
01:13:58,271 --> 01:13:59,551
Now he's getting in trouble

1374
01:14:00,063 --> 01:14:05,695
His he's been saying illegal ship at the very least

1375
01:14:05,951 --> 01:14:07,231
But this is the first time that

1376
01:14:08,767 --> 01:14:09,279
You better

1377
01:14:09,535 --> 01:14:10,047
We better go out

1378
01:14:10,559 --> 01:14:12,095
Yeah yeah

1379
01:14:12,351 --> 01:14:12,863
Angry all the

1380
01:14:13,631 --> 01:14:19,007
Forever why are you mad at me now

1381
01:14:20,031 --> 01:14:20,799
Stanford

1382
01:14:21,055 --> 01:14:23,359
Squat you down

1383
01:14:24,383 --> 01:14:26,431
Alright

1384
01:14:26,687 --> 01:14:30,015
This next clip is they get to get off track a little bit

1385
01:14:30,271 --> 01:14:32,319
Get off track

1386
01:14:32,575 --> 01:14:35,647
Does Alex keeps against you in the conversation in different direction

1387
01:14:35,903 --> 01:14:38,207
He keeps trying to not deal with substance

1388
01:14:38,463 --> 01:14:39,231
Just wants to

1389
01:14:39,743 --> 01:14:41,535
So here is a

1390
01:14:43,327 --> 01:14:44,351
I was watching the video

1391
01:14:44,607 --> 01:14:48,447
What's up saying is not what

1392
01:14:48,959 --> 01:14:49,471
Gotcha

1393
01:14:49,727 --> 01:14:50,495
You meant to say something

1394
01:14:50,751 --> 01:14:51,263
Sporeworks

1395
01:14:51,519 --> 01:14:52,543
And I wish you had

1396
01:14:53,823 --> 01:14:59,967
What's happening from 9:11 onward

1397
01:15:06,623 --> 01:15:12,767
He's doing

1398
01:15:26,847 --> 01:15:28,895
My problem

1399
01:15:43,231 --> 01:15:46,559
I would say he needs

1400
01:15:49,375 --> 01:15:55,519
I think that if

1401
01:15:55,775 --> 01:15:59,871
I think if we parse that

1402
01:16:00,895 --> 01:16:04,991
Security bulshit but I think the reality is that he's actually

1403
01:16:05,247 --> 01:16:06,527
Senile

1404
01:16:06,783 --> 01:16:08,063
And he has those people around us cared

1405
01:16:11,135 --> 01:16:13,439
You know I care this ability

1406
01:16:13,695 --> 01:16:14,207
Arguments

1407
01:16:19,839 --> 01:16:20,863
Just generally Enid

1408
01:16:21,631 --> 01:16:24,447
Play never been more than

1409
01:16:24,959 --> 01:16:27,519
Find you can go back and he's what he is

1410
01:16:29,311 --> 01:16:35,455
Senile for a 30 goddamn years

1411
01:16:35,711 --> 01:16:36,479
20 years ago

1412
01:16:38,527 --> 01:16:39,039
Stocks

1413
01:16:39,551 --> 01:16:42,367
Easier like he had much more Bible

1414
01:16:42,623 --> 01:16:43,135
Even

1415
01:16:43,391 --> 01:16:45,183
10 fifteen years ago

1416
01:16:45,695 --> 01:16:48,511
The only thing I remember from more than

1417
01:16:50,047 --> 01:16:52,351
However many months I've had to pay attention to

1418
01:16:53,119 --> 01:16:53,631
Is

1419
01:16:53,887 --> 01:16:54,399
That he was

1420
01:16:56,191 --> 01:16:56,703
Okay

1421
01:16:56,959 --> 01:17:03,103
Great he was pretty great and Home Alone 2

1422
01:17:03,615 --> 01:17:04,639
Well here's the thing

1423
01:17:05,151 --> 01:17:05,919
I think that

1424
01:17:06,175 --> 01:17:06,687
Steve pieczenik

1425
01:17:06,943 --> 01:17:08,479
Was being diplomatic as hell

1426
01:17:08,991 --> 01:17:10,527
I need

1427
01:17:10,783 --> 01:17:12,063
You could see it in his face

1428
01:17:12,319 --> 01:17:12,831
I like

1429
01:17:14,111 --> 01:17:15,903
Like a smile in like a

1430
01:17:17,951 --> 01:17:18,975
Professional

1431
01:17:19,231 --> 01:17:19,999
So anyways

1432
01:17:20,255 --> 01:17:21,535
I'm done but I

1433
01:17:21,791 --> 01:17:22,303
I love that

1434
01:17:23,583 --> 01:17:24,351
Steve pieczenik like you said

1435
01:17:24,607 --> 01:17:27,167
Killing it on fire right now

1436
01:17:27,679 --> 01:17:29,471
Is it unusual

1437
01:17:29,983 --> 01:17:32,031
Pieczenik

1438
01:17:38,431 --> 01:17:40,735
With RFK

1439
01:17:48,159 --> 01:17:51,487
She's overcome

1440
01:17:59,679 --> 01:18:00,191
I don't know

1441
01:18:00,447 --> 01:18:00,959
Gonorrhea

1442
01:18:01,471 --> 01:18:04,543
He's overcome his fear of strangers he's overcome his

1443
01:18:05,311 --> 01:18:06,335
Hey what who knows

1444
01:18:06,591 --> 01:18:12,735
Alex Jones knows something that Donald Trump has recently gotten over yeah

1445
01:18:12,991 --> 01:18:14,527
I would like to know what Alex

1446
01:18:14,783 --> 01:18:15,807
Thanks but I also

1447
01:18:17,599 --> 01:18:18,623
No

1448
01:18:19,135 --> 01:18:19,903
He didn't mean it could be

1449
01:18:20,159 --> 01:18:20,671
Syphilis

1450
01:18:21,183 --> 01:18:21,695
Trump

1451
01:18:21,951 --> 01:18:22,975
Could be

1452
01:18:24,255 --> 01:18:25,023
Go insane

1453
01:18:26,047 --> 01:18:28,351
Play around

1454
01:18:28,607 --> 01:18:29,119
AR

1455
01:18:29,375 --> 01:18:34,495
Also double down on your syphilis logic

1456
01:18:34,751 --> 01:18:36,031
Whatever dumb s*** you're saying

1457
01:18:36,287 --> 01:18:36,799
Because they also have

1458
01:18:37,055 --> 01:18:38,847
It makes sense to them

1459
01:18:39,103 --> 01:18:45,247
Conspiracy theory I've ever heard absolutely everybody with syphilis everywhere

1460
01:18:48,319 --> 01:18:48,831
They have to

1461
01:18:49,087 --> 01:18:52,159
Or if you want to be inside

1462
01:18:52,415 --> 01:18:54,719
We're recording this on Saturday

1463
01:18:54,975 --> 01:18:58,815
On Saturday did you see on Twitter the pictures of the pizza

1464
01:18:59,071 --> 01:18:59,839
Pizzagate Rally's

1465
01:19:00,095 --> 01:19:02,911
There's a pizzagate rally in Washington DC

1466
01:19:03,423 --> 01:19:04,191
It was

1467
01:19:05,983 --> 01:19:06,495
Oh man

1468
01:19:06,751 --> 01:19:08,287
The pictures are not to be believed

1469
01:19:10,591 --> 01:19:11,359
Ones

1470
01:19:11,615 --> 01:19:15,199
As I understand

1471
01:19:15,455 --> 01:19:16,735
I had did some great reporting on

1472
01:19:19,551 --> 01:19:20,063
Remember

1473
01:19:21,855 --> 01:19:22,367
Plug right

1474
01:19:24,415 --> 01:19:24,927
Steve pieczenik

1475
01:19:25,183 --> 01:19:26,975
Transitions to his other prong

1476
01:19:27,487 --> 01:19:28,767
Of his thesis

1477
01:19:29,023 --> 01:19:29,535
Pineal

1478
01:19:29,791 --> 01:19:30,559
Which is

1479
01:19:30,815 --> 01:19:31,583
About Neil Gorsuch

1480
01:19:32,095 --> 01:19:32,607
Good

1481
01:19:38,239 --> 01:19:40,287
Little bit

1482
01:19:50,527 --> 01:19:55,903
What time for such cannot be nominated to Supreme Court Justice

1483
01:19:56,415 --> 01:20:00,767
Goodbye

1484
01:20:03,839 --> 01:20:05,375
Even Steven hearing his voice

1485
01:20:12,031 --> 01:20:13,055
As he goes out to break

1486
01:20:13,311 --> 01:20:19,456
Movieclips and Moorhead of the next house to join the will be right back ladies and gentleman with it

1487
01:20:24,064 --> 01:20:27,904
Have to be back with Steve pieczenik

1488
01:20:29,952 --> 01:20:31,744
Feel good right now

1489
01:20:35,072 --> 01:20:37,632
Commercial break

1490
01:20:38,656 --> 01:20:39,680
Throwing a tantrum

1491
01:20:39,936 --> 01:20:43,008
Like you know

1492
01:20:49,152 --> 01:20:52,992
I know that Neil cons are bad but I know that

1493
01:20:53,760 --> 01:20:54,528
Does he know

1494
01:20:55,552 --> 01:20:57,088
He thinks they're trotskyites

1495
01:20:57,344 --> 01:20:59,648
Which I guess there is some historical terrible

1496
01:20:59,904 --> 01:21:04,768
Notes to come back from break Alex starts by spinning philosophical about a little

1497
01:21:05,024 --> 01:21:06,560
Bill self

1498
01:21:06,816 --> 01:21:08,096
2-channel

1499
01:21:09,888 --> 01:21:10,400
Oh really

1500
01:21:10,656 --> 01:21:14,240
Explain why exactly he's against course

1501
01:21:26,016 --> 01:21:30,880
Put also I guarantee no one's coming

1502
01:21:31,136 --> 01:21:34,976
People ask why I like people ask me all the time

1503
01:21:35,232 --> 01:21:39,328
Alex Alex

1504
01:21:39,840 --> 01:21:40,864
Do you like having a country

1505
01:21:44,448 --> 01:21:46,240
Will get better if we just had you

1506
01:21:46,752 --> 01:21:52,896
Everyone was Alex Alex and they lived exactly 24 ha

1507
01:21:53,152 --> 01:21:55,200
Because of the ideas

1508
01:21:55,456 --> 01:21:55,968
Infinity

1509
01:21:56,480 --> 01:21:59,040
Infinite worlds one world

1510
01:21:59,552 --> 01:22:02,368
Is everybody everyone everyone

1511
01:22:02,624 --> 01:22:04,416
And they all live a ha

1512
01:22:05,696 --> 01:22:07,488
Does exist

1513
01:22:07,744 --> 01:22:08,768
Well in the Multiverse

1514
01:22:09,024 --> 01:22:11,328
Except

1515
01:22:11,840 --> 01:22:13,632
And unfortunately this is happening

1516
01:22:16,960 --> 01:22:20,288
Mark Zuckerberg

1517
01:22:21,312 --> 01:22:22,080
What's a nightmare

1518
01:22:31,040 --> 01:22:36,928
Who is that you have said should happen multiple times

1519
01:22:37,440 --> 01:22:37,952
Yep

1520
01:22:38,208 --> 01:22:39,232
Bethania

1521
01:22:41,280 --> 01:22:43,072
Has advocated for

1522
01:22:43,584 --> 01:22:44,352
He is now

1523
01:22:45,632 --> 01:22:46,656
Indonesia

1524
01:22:58,432 --> 01:23:01,760
Pictures of the sky

1525
01:23:02,272 --> 01:23:03,296
Let me put it this way

1526
01:23:13,792 --> 01:23:14,816
Judge Gorsuch

1527
01:23:17,888 --> 01:23:20,704
Prosecutors after the war

1528
01:23:35,296 --> 01:23:37,600
Whatever

1529
01:23:46,048 --> 01:23:50,912
And literally began to go into the fascist state

1530
01:24:03,456 --> 01:24:06,784
Went to go in town and said this was the best

1531
01:24:11,392 --> 01:24:17,536
That we should have a policy discussion

1532
01:24:19,072 --> 01:24:22,656
The underlying nature

1533
01:24:22,912 --> 01:24:29,056
Unlike many of the German

1534
01:24:34,432 --> 01:24:40,576
Well that he made the call.

1535
01:24:43,648 --> 01:24:49,280
Stream peten elated out really well

1536
01:24:49,536 --> 01:24:51,584
F****** Scalia was you goddamn

1537
01:24:51,840 --> 01:24:52,608
Piece of s***

1538
01:24:53,888 --> 01:24:56,448
Why would you get Scalia you pile of f******

1539
01:24:56,704 --> 01:24:58,496
Let's not litigate the Dead

1540
01:24:58,752 --> 01:24:59,520
Burnout

1541
01:25:01,568 --> 01:25:04,128
Illuminati Lodge

1542
01:25:04,640 --> 01:25:05,408
Haven't murdered again

1543
01:25:05,664 --> 01:25:06,432
Murder of again

1544
01:25:06,688 --> 01:25:07,712
But like who cares

1545
01:25:07,968 --> 01:25:08,736
We're not dealing with

1546
01:25:08,992 --> 01:25:15,136
Scalia reitnouer

1547
01:25:15,392 --> 01:25:16,160
Call Nessa

1548
01:25:16,416 --> 01:25:17,440
He's

1549
01:25:17,696 --> 01:25:23,840
He's right you never liked it

1550
01:25:24,096 --> 01:25:25,888
Yeah he he was working

1551
01:25:26,656 --> 01:25:27,680
Help put through the

1552
01:25:27,936 --> 01:25:30,752
Patriot Act

1553
01:25:35,360 --> 01:25:36,896
There's no other way

1554
01:25:37,152 --> 01:25:38,432
Did you can go to wasp

1555
01:25:38,688 --> 01:25:39,712
People being tortured on a

1556
01:25:39,968 --> 01:25:40,480
Daily base

1557
01:25:41,760 --> 01:25:44,320
This is good unless you have zero empathy

1558
01:25:44,832 --> 01:25:48,416
Make you necessarily associate like a situation

1559
01:25:48,928 --> 01:25:53,280
Right cuz you just believe these other people don't have

1560
01:25:53,536 --> 01:25:54,304
But other people who are like

1561
01:25:54,560 --> 01:25:55,328
Like you do

1562
01:25:55,584 --> 01:25:56,096
Like this

1563
01:25:56,352 --> 01:25:56,864
Juuzou

1564
01:25:59,424 --> 01:26:02,240
Absolutely I'm a big fan of saying the word Nazi

1565
01:26:02,752 --> 01:26:05,824
Yeah you are I'm not going to go quite as far as

1566
01:26:09,152 --> 01:26:09,664
Nazi

1567
01:26:11,200 --> 01:26:11,712
Going to go knock

1568
01:26:11,968 --> 01:26:13,248
Buffalo

1569
01:26:16,064 --> 01:26:18,112
Neil Gorsuch

1570
01:26:18,368 --> 01:26:19,648
Support

1571
01:26:20,160 --> 01:26:21,440
Which is fascinating

1572
01:26:21,696 --> 01:26:22,720
And

1573
01:26:23,744 --> 01:26:24,256
What's can't handle it

1574
01:26:24,768 --> 01:26:25,536
Alex can't do it

1575
01:26:26,048 --> 01:26:29,376
At least with Cheney I knew what Cheney was he was a rat

1576
01:26:45,504 --> 01:26:47,296
Lawyer

1577
01:27:03,168 --> 01:27:03,680
Yeah

1578
01:27:05,472 --> 01:27:05,984
Wow

1579
01:27:07,520 --> 01:27:09,056
Man I am jerking off to

1580
01:27:11,616 --> 01:27:12,896
Libertyville

1581
01:27:13,152 --> 01:27:17,248
That's right through these last two there's two more clips of pechenik

1582
01:27:18,272 --> 01:27:21,088
Do you like

1583
01:27:21,344 --> 01:27:22,368
Is a Madman

1584
01:27:22,624 --> 01:27:23,904
Obviously in response

1585
01:27:24,160 --> 01:27:26,976
What's to how poorly The Sinner

1586
01:27:27,232 --> 01:27:31,584
Sent him into an existential crisis

1587
01:27:33,888 --> 01:27:35,680
Botanica's talks for a bit of a stretch

1588
01:27:35,936 --> 01:27:38,240
It's kind of like sitting there like

1589
01:27:42,080 --> 01:27:48,224
Not working that I've ever heard of guess

1590
01:27:49,760 --> 01:27:50,272
Right

1591
01:27:51,296 --> 01:27:53,600
Throne

1592
01:27:54,368 --> 01:27:57,696
Who is in the first few clips of

1593
01:27:57,952 --> 01:27:58,720
Interview Alex

1594
01:27:58,976 --> 01:28:04,608
Was constantly trying to reshape the argument even said I'm trying to get you to talk about what I want you to talk about

1595
01:28:04,864 --> 01:28:05,888
Any realized

1596
01:28:06,400 --> 01:28:07,168
Can't do it

1597
01:28:07,424 --> 01:28:08,448
Steve is too forceful

1598
01:28:08,704 --> 01:28:09,472
So he's given up

1599
01:28:11,776 --> 01:28:13,056
Once again discovered

1600
01:28:13,568 --> 01:28:14,592
Alex is a bully

1601
01:28:14,848 --> 01:28:16,128
Are p****

1602
01:28:16,384 --> 01:28:16,896
Not allowed

1603
01:28:18,432 --> 01:28:20,736
Sucks sucks

1604
01:28:20,992 --> 01:28:22,528
Yeah but

1605
01:28:22,784 --> 01:28:23,808
Sulking right now

1606
01:28:24,064 --> 01:28:25,088
Like a real man

1607
01:28:27,904 --> 01:28:29,696
He makes one last effort to sort of.

1608
01:28:29,952 --> 01:28:31,232
Distract

1609
01:28:31,488 --> 01:28:32,256
The narratives that are going

1610
01:28:34,048 --> 01:28:35,840
His last 12

1611
01:28:36,096 --> 01:28:39,936
Skyfall doors whatever

1612
01:28:58,112 --> 01:29:00,160
Nunez

1613
01:29:05,536 --> 01:29:11,680
What does it mean that the media

1614
01:29:15,008 --> 01:29:17,568
It's a distraction

1615
01:29:17,824 --> 01:29:23,456
Yourself

1616
01:29:23,712 --> 01:29:29,856
When they're up there saying we're Liars

1617
01:29:48,288 --> 01:29:54,432
Turn off the command

1618
01:30:04,160 --> 01:30:07,232
I'm sorry Alex what's going on

1619
01:30:07,744 --> 01:30:11,328
No he just didn't understand what the f*** Alex told us

1620
01:30:11,584 --> 01:30:12,864
You didn't understand

1621
01:30:13,120 --> 01:30:15,168
What

1622
01:30:15,424 --> 01:30:20,544
How many angels can fit on the head of the mom is the doctor

1623
01:30:22,080 --> 01:30:22,848
Is Trump

1624
01:30:23,360 --> 01:30:23,872
Nicolas Cage

1625
01:30:24,640 --> 01:30:30,784
I can't prove he's not that's a good point so this next clip is the end of the interview and I don't want to spoil

1626
01:30:31,040 --> 01:30:31,552
How It Ends

1627
01:30:32,064 --> 01:30:33,344
But just listen for it

1628
01:30:34,112 --> 01:30:34,624
It's

1629
01:30:35,904 --> 01:30:36,672
It made me

1630
01:30:37,184 --> 01:30:38,720
It ends with a review of Beauty and the Beat

1631
01:30:38,976 --> 01:30:39,744
Yeah

1632
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:42,816
And they're like man I wish she had done more of the original

1633
01:30:43,072 --> 01:30:46,400
Episode

1634
01:30:46,912 --> 01:30:47,424
I can keep track of

1635
01:30:47,680 --> 01:30:49,216
Anybody in Hollywood

1636
01:30:49,472 --> 01:30:50,240
The end of this

1637
01:30:50,496 --> 01:30:51,008
Is

1638
01:30:52,800 --> 01:30:53,312
Enjoy

1639
01:30:54,336 --> 01:30:56,128
I just know that when I heard this I got a shiver

1640
01:30:56,640 --> 01:30:58,688
I got a shiver in my spine

1641
01:31:20,704 --> 01:31:24,032
Literally

1642
01:31:31,200 --> 01:31:37,344
888

1643
01:31:39,648 --> 01:31:45,792
Marshall and Eisenhower

1644
01:31:51,936 --> 01:31:52,704
Oh man

1645
01:31:53,216 --> 01:31:54,496
That is not how you ended in Urdu

1646
01:31:54,752 --> 01:32:00,896
That is not how you end marital fight that's what that was I was so abrupt husband

1647
01:32:01,152 --> 01:32:03,968
Go to couples counseling

1648
01:32:04,224 --> 01:32:10,368
The military-industrial complex

1649
01:32:15,744 --> 01:32:17,280
So you just shut down

1650
01:32:21,376 --> 01:32:23,680
Went to town now you might think

1651
01:32:24,704 --> 01:32:25,472
Fed economist

1652
01:32:25,728 --> 01:32:27,264
That abruptly

1653
01:32:27,776 --> 01:32:30,336
I just made the same arguments that I could have made

1654
01:32:41,600 --> 01:32:45,696
Did the budget for the military is out of control doesn't make more money

1655
01:32:45,952 --> 01:32:51,072
Doesn't part where he was talking about how Isis is

1656
01:32:51,328 --> 01:32:54,912
Controlled by the CIA

1657
01:32:55,168 --> 01:32:56,192
All right but

1658
01:32:56,448 --> 01:33:00,544
The biggest Point Wisteria is amazing

1659
01:33:00,800 --> 01:33:03,616
Because we're so distracted by all the

1660
01:33:04,128 --> 01:33:06,688
The Trump is doing well forget that Trump has now killed

1661
01:33:06,944 --> 01:33:08,480
More civilians in Syria in

1662
01:33:08,736 --> 01:33:10,272
In the first 2 months

1663
01:33:12,576 --> 01:33:13,088
Jeers

1664
01:33:13,344 --> 01:33:15,392
Yeah

1665
01:33:15,648 --> 01:33:17,184
Insane and we can't

1666
01:33:17,440 --> 01:33:21,280
We can't add that to our list of calamities that were trying to deal with Ray

1667
01:33:21,792 --> 01:33:25,632
There's so much going on

1668
01:33:26,144 --> 01:33:26,656
Yeah

1669
01:33:26,912 --> 01:33:29,216
We are murdering people and nobody can

1670
01:33:31,008 --> 01:33:32,800
F****** nuts

1671
01:33:33,056 --> 01:33:34,336
Control

1672
01:33:34,848 --> 01:33:37,152
You grab hold of one thing to focus on

1673
01:33:37,408 --> 01:33:38,944
You lose track of 20

1674
01:33:40,992 --> 01:33:41,504
You might think

1675
01:33:41,760 --> 01:33:42,272
Just because a Time

1676
01:33:44,576 --> 01:33:49,184
It is not because

1677
01:33:49,440 --> 01:33:52,512
I think she might want to say that it was because the time

1678
01:33:54,560 --> 01:33:55,584
The next half hour

1679
01:33:56,096 --> 01:33:59,168
Before I think David Knight takes over for the 4th hour

1680
01:33:59,424 --> 01:33:59,936
Prove

1681
01:34:00,448 --> 01:34:00,960
Pikachu

1682
01:34:01,216 --> 01:34:05,824
Much longer because he's gotten nothing.

1683
01:34:06,080 --> 01:34:09,408
But it is

1684
01:34:09,664 --> 01:34:10,432
It starts

1685
01:34:10,688 --> 01:34:12,736
I'm misinterpreting something from the Buy

1686
01:34:26,048 --> 01:34:27,072
He got it from the White House

1687
01:34:27,328 --> 01:34:30,400
Trump wasn't the target

1688
01:34:30,912 --> 01:34:32,960
It was his building and his phone numbers

1689
01:34:33,216 --> 01:34:33,984
And staff

1690
01:34:34,240 --> 01:34:37,056
Wasn't that again folks

1691
01:34:37,824 --> 01:34:39,872
Temperature Detroit gets a distraction

1692
01:34:41,408 --> 01:34:47,552
They're going to call for martial law comes true

1693
01:34:47,808 --> 01:34:51,136
We have to point it out cuz they're saying where the fake nose

1694
01:34:51,648 --> 01:34:52,160
Nope

1695
01:34:53,696 --> 01:34:57,536
If we point out front was being surveilled

1696
01:34:58,048 --> 01:34:58,816
And then it

1697
01:34:59,072 --> 01:35:05,216
Do it because

1698
01:35:11,616 --> 01:35:14,688
They didn't leave the younger son says I want my inheritance

1699
01:35:15,712 --> 01:35:18,528
Everything's right here at our ranch or Farm

1700
01:35:25,184 --> 01:35:30,048
Comes back Miller Brothers like I've been a good Steward what the hell you're having a party

1701
01:35:36,448 --> 01:35:37,728
Migos

1702
01:35:39,008 --> 01:35:40,288
This is your brother

1703
01:35:44,384 --> 01:35:46,688
You're strong respect you do that

1704
01:35:46,944 --> 01:35:47,968
Family

1705
01:35:51,552 --> 01:35:54,624
Yeah that's what I said was about

1706
01:35:56,672 --> 01:35:58,976
Sure he's ever

1707
01:35:59,232 --> 01:36:00,000
Read the Bible

1708
01:36:00,256 --> 01:36:01,280
Nobies write the headline

1709
01:36:05,120 --> 01:36:08,448
He doesn't know how to read

1710
01:36:09,216 --> 01:36:14,592
The Texas Public Schools failed him he has no reading comprehension skills

1711
01:36:14,848 --> 01:36:18,432
The prodigal son was about as I understand it

1712
01:36:20,224 --> 01:36:20,736
The dads like

1713
01:36:20,992 --> 01:36:27,136
Dude you're fine look at this idiot

1714
01:36:27,392 --> 01:36:29,440
Okay so there's a couple problems with his interpretation

1715
01:36:29,696 --> 01:36:30,208
The Prodigal Son

1716
01:36:30,720 --> 01:36:33,280
The first is vidan

1717
01:36:33,536 --> 01:36:34,048
Is the book

1718
01:36:34,560 --> 01:36:35,840
Burden in the parable

1719
01:36:36,096 --> 01:36:38,144
In the Bible

1720
01:36:39,424 --> 01:36:45,568
Realizes the error of his ways

1721
01:36:46,592 --> 01:36:48,896
And is welcome to back by the father

1722
01:36:49,152 --> 01:36:49,920
Anna brother is

1723
01:36:50,432 --> 01:36:52,480
Inspired

1724
01:36:52,736 --> 01:36:53,504
Is now alive

1725
01:36:53,760 --> 01:36:54,528
That is a celebration

1726
01:36:55,552 --> 01:36:56,832
Now the problem for Alex

1727
01:36:58,112 --> 01:36:59,136
In order for give

1728
01:36:59,648 --> 01:37:00,160
Sorta

1729
01:37:00,416 --> 01:37:01,696
Analogy to make sense

1730
01:37:02,208 --> 01:37:04,000
All of us at some point would have had

1731
01:37:04,256 --> 01:37:05,792
Doobie info Warriors who strayed

1732
01:37:06,560 --> 01:37:07,328
Are we got

1733
01:37:07,584 --> 01:37:08,096
Sort of trick

1734
01:37:08,352 --> 01:37:09,632
By the mainstream media

1735
01:37:10,144 --> 01:37:11,680
Evan now he wants a

1736
01:37:11,936 --> 01:37:12,448
The comeback

1737
01:37:12,704 --> 01:37:14,240
Is that what you saying

1738
01:37:14,496 --> 01:37:15,008
Kind of

1739
01:37:15,264 --> 01:37:15,776
Yes

1740
01:37:16,032 --> 01:37:17,568
I didn't understand the

1741
01:37:17,824 --> 01:37:21,664
Analogy or his using of is

1742
01:37:21,920 --> 01:37:23,456
These people who aren't

1743
01:37:24,224 --> 01:37:25,760
Redpilled aswar

1744
01:37:26,016 --> 01:37:28,576
No the people who don't who don't see the truth

1745
01:37:28,832 --> 01:37:29,600
Put in for warriors

1746
01:37:30,368 --> 01:37:31,648
The Prodigal Son

1747
01:37:31,904 --> 01:37:32,672
He wants to come back

1748
01:37:34,208 --> 01:37:34,720
Whenever

1749
01:37:37,792 --> 01:37:39,584
All right now the second problem

1750
01:37:39,840 --> 01:37:40,864
Is in

1751
01:37:41,376 --> 01:37:42,400
The Prodigal Son

1752
01:37:42,656 --> 01:37:44,192
The father doesn't

1753
01:37:44,448 --> 01:37:45,216
Scream at the Sun

1754
01:37:45,472 --> 01:37:46,752
The comeback

1755
01:37:56,992 --> 01:37:58,528
The idea of it is

1756
01:37:58,784 --> 01:38:00,576
A lesson learned brings you back

1757
01:38:00,832 --> 01:38:01,856
Back to where you were supposed

1758
01:38:02,112 --> 01:38:04,416
Not that being screamed at

1759
01:38:04,672 --> 01:38:05,952
Get you in line

1760
01:38:07,232 --> 01:38:08,512
Alex is really dumb

1761
01:38:12,096 --> 01:38:17,984
Scripture every now and again because of you.

1762
01:38:18,240 --> 01:38:21,056
So he goes on from here to get even weirder

1763
01:38:21,568 --> 01:38:22,848
This clips

1764
01:38:23,104 --> 01:38:24,384
Start with him

1765
01:38:26,432 --> 01:38:27,968
The perfect example of how

1766
01:38:28,992 --> 01:38:30,528
He starts with some false modesty

1767
01:38:31,040 --> 01:38:32,320
He gets into an impression

1768
01:38:34,368 --> 01:38:35,648
F*****-up analogy

1769
01:38:35,904 --> 01:38:36,672
I love

1770
01:38:37,696 --> 01:38:38,976
Analogies

1771
01:38:39,488 --> 01:38:41,024
Do we get a personal history

1772
01:38:41,536 --> 01:38:43,328
No personal history in this episode

1773
01:38:43,584 --> 01:38:46,912
Obsessed with finding out more about him

1774
01:38:47,424 --> 01:38:49,984
Never looking it up or doing any research of my own

1775
01:38:50,240 --> 01:38:51,520
This analogy makes

1776
01:38:51,776 --> 01:38:52,288
Haslam

1777
01:38:52,544 --> 01:38:54,848
Okay

1778
01:38:55,104 --> 01:38:55,872
Be able to sleep

1779
01:38:56,128 --> 01:39:01,760
You have done nothing

1780
01:39:02,528 --> 01:39:07,648
I want to request that you don't say anything over that least the end of this because

1781
01:39:07,904 --> 01:39:08,928
You need to hear him say that

1782
01:39:09,184 --> 01:39:10,208
Okay cuz otherwise

1783
01:39:10,464 --> 01:39:11,744
If you don't get all the words

1784
01:39:12,256 --> 01:39:12,768
It might

1785
01:39:13,024 --> 01:39:13,792
You might think

1786
01:39:14,304 --> 01:39:15,584
It's f***** up as it is

1787
01:39:16,096 --> 01:39:17,120
It's super fun.

1788
01:39:24,544 --> 01:39:29,664
Cuz I don't want to die

1789
01:39:30,176 --> 01:39:31,712
This is still present Vance

1790
01:39:32,736 --> 01:39:33,248
Resume

1791
01:39:34,784 --> 01:39:40,928
You should we want we want the people who aren't totally turned over to why we want

1792
01:39:41,184 --> 01:39:42,208
To reach out to them

1793
01:39:45,024 --> 01:39:47,584
The government

1794
01:39:48,352 --> 01:39:53,472
Jonathan Gruber says you're dumb I don't think you're dumb

1795
01:39:55,776 --> 01:39:57,824
Get connected to God you can live

1796
01:39:58,592 --> 01:40:02,688
That's how I've got to talk to you

1797
01:40:02,944 --> 01:40:04,480
Like MPR

1798
01:40:04,992 --> 01:40:06,016
It's not a retard

1799
01:40:06,272 --> 01:40:12,416
Trump talks to people watching real slow

1800
01:40:12,672 --> 01:40:16,512
Not because he doesn't know that you don't already know at

1801
01:40:17,280 --> 01:40:23,424
Also known as now I don't know what again after you he's doing the Android guy for Lord of the Rings

1802
01:40:23,680 --> 01:40:24,448
Ganges

1803
01:40:24,704 --> 01:40:26,752
Better than a sleep stage

1804
01:40:29,312 --> 01:40:31,104
Out of the sleep

1805
01:40:38,528 --> 01:40:39,552
I understand

1806
01:40:46,976 --> 01:40:48,512
Because

1807
01:40:53,888 --> 01:40:55,680
That's fine

1808
01:40:56,192 --> 01:40:58,240
Communicating with the people

1809
01:41:06,688 --> 01:41:09,248
Do you watch it's called stroller going to win they want a violin

1810
01:41:09,760 --> 01:41:11,552
Because I think they can defeat that

1811
01:41:11,808 --> 01:41:14,624
We're going to be peaceful until they attack us and then

1812
01:41:28,448 --> 01:41:28,960
You know

1813
01:41:29,984 --> 01:41:34,080
I'm sorry

1814
01:41:35,360 --> 01:41:37,664
Take up an old polar something on the side

1815
01:41:38,688 --> 01:41:43,552
Italian-based brains out

1816
01:41:51,744 --> 01:41:52,512
Mudbound

1817
01:41:52,768 --> 01:41:53,536
Goddamn

1818
01:41:53,792 --> 01:41:54,560
Fuk was that

1819
01:41:57,888 --> 01:42:00,960
What any of that mean

1820
01:42:01,216 --> 01:42:02,496
I know is that he

1821
01:42:03,008 --> 01:42:04,032
Too f******

1822
01:42:04,288 --> 01:42:08,896
And he said it came off someone's back porch with someone

1823
01:42:11,200 --> 01:42:17,088
It's not what you might have

1824
01:42:17,600 --> 01:42:19,648
Oh yeah

1825
01:42:19,904 --> 01:42:20,416
I think

1826
01:42:20,672 --> 01:42:21,440
That the analogy

1827
01:42:21,952 --> 01:42:22,720
Trying to make

1828
01:42:23,232 --> 01:42:23,744
Failed

1829
01:42:24,512 --> 01:42:25,024
F*** with that

1830
01:42:25,280 --> 01:42:31,424
Make me feel better in like you see it

1831
01:42:31,680 --> 01:42:33,216
Babies hurting and dying on the

1832
01:42:33,472 --> 01:42:34,496
Street and got a mercy killing

1833
01:42:35,008 --> 01:42:36,032
Or something like that

1834
01:42:36,288 --> 01:42:36,800
Dumb.

1835
01:42:37,056 --> 01:42:38,336
He did

1836
01:42:38,592 --> 01:42:44,736
You don't like it like that you know I didn't mean if you can't wake up your like a dumb dog murder

1837
01:42:44,992 --> 01:42:46,528
I've had with a pole

1838
01:42:47,040 --> 01:42:48,832
No pleasure in murdering

1839
01:42:51,392 --> 01:42:51,904
Xena

1840
01:42:52,160 --> 01:42:57,792
If you murdered if you used the metaphor that he's making

1841
01:42:59,072 --> 01:42:59,840
Sometimes

1842
01:43:00,096 --> 01:43:01,888
I take no pleasure in it

1843
01:43:02,144 --> 01:43:04,192
But some people must die

1844
01:43:05,728 --> 01:43:06,496
That's f****** nuts

1845
01:43:06,752 --> 01:43:07,520
He's losing it

1846
01:43:07,776 --> 01:43:13,920
That Leanne Wackadoo level you see how like lazily he's delivering

1847
01:43:14,432 --> 01:43:15,712
Keith so f******

1848
01:43:15,968 --> 01:43:18,784
Fun out of control because of this interview with

1849
01:43:19,296 --> 01:43:19,808
Like it

1850
01:43:20,320 --> 01:43:22,368
All the other stuff that's going on in the world

1851
01:43:22,624 --> 01:43:25,696
This clear lawsuit about pizza gate that's in the in the works

1852
01:43:25,952 --> 01:43:28,000
His Admiral money going away

1853
01:43:30,304 --> 01:43:32,864
Better promoting his website which even if

1854
01:43:33,376 --> 01:43:34,912
There's no involvement with Russia

1855
01:43:35,424 --> 01:43:37,728
He's going to have to realize that that meme

1856
01:43:37,984 --> 01:43:39,264
All this newfound

1857
01:43:39,520 --> 01:43:40,544
Audience is fake

1858
01:43:40,800 --> 01:43:44,640
Is not real he doesn't actually have the popularity do you think he has

1859
01:43:44,896 --> 01:43:46,688
A lot of it is automated traffic

1860
01:43:46,944 --> 01:43:47,712
And s*** like that

1861
01:43:47,968 --> 01:43:49,760
This is spinning in his head

1862
01:43:50,016 --> 01:43:53,344
Now he's got Steve pieczenik on his show where he's like Alright

1863
01:43:53,600 --> 01:43:55,904
This is Safe Harbor this guy likes me

1864
01:43:56,160 --> 01:43:59,232
We're going to just spend some conspiracy Yarns together and scare some people

1865
01:43:59,744 --> 01:44:03,072
And plucking even stupid people play ball and now

1866
01:44:03,584 --> 01:44:04,352
But what do I do

1867
01:44:04,864 --> 01:44:07,168
Imagine murdering people

1868
01:44:10,496 --> 01:44:11,008
Like

1869
01:44:11,264 --> 01:44:12,288
Like that interview with

1870
01:44:13,824 --> 01:44:15,104
Taking him to a Violent Femmes

1871
01:44:15,360 --> 01:44:17,152
It's like that's what he's going on right there

1872
01:44:18,432 --> 01:44:18,944
Whole thing's

1873
01:44:19,200 --> 01:44:23,296
He's now he's responding to that the only way he knows his Ultra male

1874
01:44:23,808 --> 01:44:24,576
We got a murder p

1875
01:44:25,088 --> 01:44:28,416
Esoteric does

1876
01:44:29,696 --> 01:44:34,560
You've got to start up even for Alex

1877
01:44:36,608 --> 01:44:38,400
He's kind of like a boat adrift at this point

1878
01:44:38,656 --> 01:44:43,008
You've got to find something to hold onto something to Anchor member the story of the prodigal

1879
01:44:44,288 --> 01:44:45,056
The Sun goes out

1880
01:44:45,568 --> 01:44:46,848
After getting all of his

1881
01:44:47,104 --> 01:44:48,384
Inheritance before he deserves it

1882
01:44:48,640 --> 01:44:49,408
And then

1883
01:44:50,944 --> 01:44:51,456
Just party

1884
01:44:51,968 --> 01:44:54,272
And then his dad murders in like a dog

1885
01:44:54,528 --> 01:45:00,672
You remember that part of the Bride

1886
01:45:01,952 --> 01:45:03,488
The f*** you're murdering my brother

1887
01:45:03,744 --> 01:45:07,328
He's like dude he was protocol

1888
01:45:07,584 --> 01:45:08,096
Paf

1889
01:45:09,888 --> 01:45:11,680
He's a boat address

1890
01:45:11,936 --> 01:45:13,472
Anchor onto something

1891
01:45:13,728 --> 01:45:14,752
The only thing

1892
01:45:15,264 --> 01:45:16,544
If you've been talkin about that

1893
01:45:16,800 --> 01:45:19,104
Doesn't really relate back to things

1894
01:45:19,360 --> 01:45:19,872
But he got

1895
01:45:20,128 --> 01:45:22,432
Slap down by pieczenik about

1896
01:45:22,688 --> 01:45:23,200
Nunez

1897
01:45:23,712 --> 01:45:24,480
Wiretapping

1898
01:45:26,784 --> 01:45:28,832
Do you take 17 yet

1899
01:45:30,112 --> 01:45:31,904
Now as like

1900
01:45:32,160 --> 01:45:34,208
Okay I'm going to use him to 2

1901
01:45:34,464 --> 01:45:34,976
Steady mice

1902
01:45:35,232 --> 01:45:37,024
Who's next

1903
01:45:39,072 --> 01:45:40,864
Knows everything about this

1904
01:45:41,120 --> 01:45:45,472
I don't know about that as Jetsam Diwali records some bad one Rider

1905
01:45:47,264 --> 01:45:48,288
People

1906
01:45:49,056 --> 01:45:50,336
Trump's transition team

1907
01:45:51,872 --> 01:45:54,688
So

1908
01:45:54,944 --> 01:45:56,224
Intelligence committee about his

1909
01:46:00,320 --> 01:46:01,344
Directly to the White House

1910
01:46:01,600 --> 01:46:04,672
Given to him by the Trump White House

1911
01:46:05,696 --> 01:46:06,208
Steve Bannon

1912
01:46:06,464 --> 01:46:09,024
Trump as we've already established

1913
01:46:09,280 --> 01:46:12,096
Doesn't have Anka or Kushner there

1914
01:46:15,168 --> 01:46:16,192
Cuz he can't communicate with

1915
01:46:16,448 --> 01:46:19,264
People in office

1916
01:46:19,776 --> 01:46:22,336
Speaking of what I mean about that but

1917
01:46:22,592 --> 01:46:23,360
To the Nunez

1918
01:46:24,384 --> 01:46:24,896
Information

1919
01:46:25,152 --> 01:46:26,176
Stuff that press conference

1920
01:46:26,432 --> 01:46:26,944
Citadel

1921
01:46:27,200 --> 01:46:27,968
To use Alex

1922
01:46:28,224 --> 01:46:30,016
Terminology I reverse engineered

1923
01:46:30,272 --> 01:46:31,552
The next episode

1924
01:46:32,320 --> 01:46:33,600
It's going to be laid back

1925
01:46:35,392 --> 01:46:36,160
The f*** out of the next

1926
01:46:38,720 --> 01:46:42,304
Because

1927
01:46:42,816 --> 01:46:44,096
They're coming

1928
01:46:44,352 --> 01:46:45,632
He's the one guy

1929
01:46:46,144 --> 01:46:46,912
In that hole

1930
01:46:52,032 --> 01:46:54,080
You work for

1931
01:46:55,360 --> 01:46:56,384
Hawaii

1932
01:46:56,640 --> 01:47:00,736
Elijah Cummings I mean give me a break man

1933
01:47:02,016 --> 01:47:06,368
So controlled by the Russians during the Cold War

1934
01:47:06,624 --> 01:47:10,464
Look at people

1935
01:47:10,976 --> 01:47:14,048
He's just telling the truth and say he's an evil person

1936
01:47:20,704 --> 01:47:21,216
Gimme a Break

1937
01:47:23,264 --> 01:47:24,032
Break me off a piece

1938
01:47:24,288 --> 01:47:24,800
Piece of that

1939
01:47:26,336 --> 01:47:27,616
I'm not

1940
01:47:34,528 --> 01:47:35,552
I just don't

1941
01:47:35,808 --> 01:47:41,696
I don't know if he realizes he's doing it

1942
01:47:41,952 --> 01:47:47,072
It's the only thing he can do

1943
01:47:53,728 --> 01:47:59,872
I don't feel powerful demon Michael Moore a total piece of crap traitor to humanity I Total Wine slug

1944
01:48:08,064 --> 01:48:10,112
Not

1945
01:48:10,624 --> 01:48:11,136
There was a cuck

1946
01:48:11,648 --> 01:48:12,928
Lecturing

1947
01:48:13,184 --> 01:48:13,696
Steve pieczenik

1948
01:48:16,000 --> 01:48:16,512
Higher up

1949
01:48:17,280 --> 01:48:18,560
Turn off are you meaning

1950
01:48:19,072 --> 01:48:19,840
Steve pieczenik is

1951
01:48:20,096 --> 01:48:25,216
You know he's like a mid-tier guy that I don't need to lecture the mid-level guy

1952
01:48:26,752 --> 01:48:28,544
Do all the stuff

1953
01:48:28,800 --> 01:48:31,616
And I think a lot of response

1954
01:48:31,872 --> 01:48:35,712
Indicates the Steve listens to the show he can't be happy with

1955
01:48:35,968 --> 01:48:37,248
Where Alex went after the

1956
01:48:40,576 --> 01:48:44,672
If I were him I would baby maybe he got the maybe got the

1957
01:48:44,928 --> 01:48:47,744
Just later on from somebody

1958
01:48:49,024 --> 01:48:49,536
Alright

1959
01:48:50,560 --> 01:48:55,680
And

1960
01:48:55,936 --> 01:48:59,520
Fundamental

1961
01:48:59,776 --> 01:49:00,800
Nope and that's

1962
01:49:01,056 --> 01:49:04,128
Republican General About Liberty and the

1963
01:49:04,640 --> 01:49:07,968
Disappeared

1964
01:49:08,480 --> 01:49:09,248
Surprise him

1965
01:49:13,344 --> 01:49:17,440
I just instinctively have to try to sit there

1966
01:49:17,696 --> 01:49:20,512
And then when I walked into place yesterday for dinner

1967
01:49:24,096 --> 01:49:25,888
Young charger Wireless

1968
01:49:43,552 --> 01:49:45,088
Is what makes me even funny

1969
01:49:45,856 --> 01:49:50,720
Because they have to make it a joke that I'm so right because she then they might

1970
01:49:50,976 --> 01:49:52,256
Do something

1971
01:49:54,560 --> 01:49:55,584
Alex Alex Alex

1972
01:49:56,096 --> 01:49:56,864
Alex baby

1973
01:49:57,120 --> 01:49:57,632
What

1974
01:49:59,168 --> 01:50:05,312
Do you being does not make you funny that's not what we're laughing at

1975
01:50:05,824 --> 01:50:06,336
Attractive

1976
01:50:06,592 --> 01:50:08,128
Hell yeah

1977
01:50:09,408 --> 01:50:09,920
Not

1978
01:50:10,176 --> 01:50:11,456
As an unusual occurrence

1979
01:50:15,552 --> 01:50:18,112
Or husband

1980
01:50:18,624 --> 01:50:19,648
For husband

1981
01:50:19,904 --> 01:50:20,416
As we all know

1982
01:50:20,672 --> 01:50:21,440
You can tell him

1983
01:50:21,696 --> 01:50:24,256
Muslim headscarf

1984
01:50:26,560 --> 01:50:30,656
No that's what trends are in the Muslim headscarves

1985
01:50:32,448 --> 01:50:35,008
Sew-in in that they were making fun

1986
01:50:35,264 --> 01:50:36,288
Yeah in that

1987
01:50:36,544 --> 01:50:37,056
Story

1988
01:50:42,432 --> 01:50:45,248
I think that maybe someone's like

1989
01:50:45,760 --> 01:50:48,064
That's it

1990
01:50:48,320 --> 01:50:48,832
Not a story

1991
01:50:49,600 --> 01:50:50,112
No

1992
01:50:50,368 --> 01:50:52,160
Is there a point deer

1993
01:50:54,464 --> 01:50:56,768
He's so right the people have to make him into a joke

1994
01:50:57,792 --> 01:50:58,304
He's not right

1995
01:50:59,328 --> 01:51:01,632
He's wrong about

1996
01:51:01,888 --> 01:51:02,400
Yeah

1997
01:51:02,656 --> 01:51:07,520
He's so wrong about being right that he's a joke

1998
01:51:09,312 --> 01:51:09,824
He's a joke

1999
01:51:10,080 --> 01:51:11,872
He's been wrong about countless things

2000
01:51:12,128 --> 01:51:12,640
Just today

2001
01:51:14,432 --> 01:51:16,736
I can't say whether or not he's wrong about

2002
01:51:16,992 --> 01:51:20,064
This next thing but I do think that maybe the the LS

2003
01:51:20,832 --> 01:51:22,880
Kickstand right before the split

2004
01:51:23,392 --> 01:51:24,160
The lawyer Boyer

2005
01:51:25,952 --> 01:51:26,464
I love the

2006
01:51:26,976 --> 01:51:27,744
Weird little deep

2007
01:51:28,512 --> 01:51:29,280
Throws into this that

2008
01:51:29,536 --> 01:51:32,096
What's a good restaurant

2009
01:51:32,352 --> 01:51:32,864
You going to

2010
01:51:33,120 --> 01:51:33,632
Yeah

2011
01:51:33,888 --> 01:51:34,656
There's this whole life

2012
01:51:34,912 --> 01:51:35,680
It's like a lot like any

2013
01:51:35,936 --> 01:51:37,728
What time you're lying you end up putting a lot more

2014
01:51:37,984 --> 01:51:38,752
Details

2015
01:51:39,520 --> 01:51:42,336
But also there's all these like little psychological things

2016
01:51:42,592 --> 01:51:43,104
Is it go into there

2017
01:51:43,360 --> 01:51:43,872
Words like

2018
01:51:44,128 --> 01:51:44,640
I would

2019
01:51:44,896 --> 01:51:45,408
Never speak

2020
01:51:45,664 --> 01:51:46,176
To somebody who

2021
01:51:46,432 --> 01:51:47,200
Wasn't a Baha'i

2022
01:51:47,968 --> 01:51:49,248
Only the higher class

2023
01:51:49,760 --> 01:51:50,272
Will come up to me

2024
01:51:50,528 --> 01:51:51,296
I go to the

2025
01:51:51,552 --> 01:51:52,320
These places where the higher

2026
01:51:54,368 --> 01:51:54,880
Strfkr

2027
01:51:55,392 --> 01:51:57,696
Yamini begs the question how

2028
01:51:58,208 --> 01:51:58,720
Does he know that

2029
01:51:58,976 --> 01:51:59,488
These are lawyers

2030
01:52:04,864 --> 01:52:07,936
He very much implies that that was the end of the converse

2031
01:52:08,704 --> 01:52:11,520
Yeah like there's no there's no content like if he had

2032
01:52:11,776 --> 01:52:12,288
Conversation

2033
01:52:12,544 --> 01:52:13,056
With them

2034
01:52:13,312 --> 01:52:14,080
He would have

2035
01:52:14,336 --> 01:52:15,360
I told us all about that

2036
01:52:15,616 --> 01:52:16,384
Probably

2037
01:52:17,664 --> 01:52:19,712
Just laughed at him a little bit

2038
01:52:21,504 --> 01:52:24,064
Their lawyers villars told me they watch what we watch

2039
01:52:24,320 --> 01:52:24,832
Shoe Show

2040
01:52:25,088 --> 01:52:26,368
We watch a show and then they laughed at

2041
01:52:26,624 --> 01:52:29,184
Crushing pressure that exist

2042
01:52:29,440 --> 01:52:30,976
To be Alex Jones right now

2043
01:52:31,232 --> 01:52:34,304
I don't f****** difficult to imagine

2044
01:52:34,560 --> 01:52:35,072
The crushing pressure

2045
01:52:35,584 --> 01:52:36,608
Because all

2046
01:52:37,120 --> 01:52:39,424
The 23 years you went ignored

2047
01:52:39,680 --> 01:52:40,192
Is coming back

2048
01:52:40,448 --> 01:52:41,216
Taunton

2049
01:52:41,728 --> 01:52:47,872
Like before no one gave a s***

2050
01:52:48,128 --> 01:52:48,896
Unfortunately

2051
01:52:49,152 --> 01:52:50,176
You spent 20 years

2052
01:52:50,432 --> 01:52:51,712
Building a

2053
01:52:52,480 --> 01:52:54,272
Yeah and building up a

2054
01:52:54,784 --> 01:52:56,064
Very respectable

2055
01:52:56,320 --> 01:52:57,344
But not all that

2056
01:52:57,600 --> 01:52:58,112
Huge

2057
01:52:58,368 --> 01:52:59,136
Audience

2058
01:53:00,416 --> 01:53:01,184
Real

2059
01:53:01,696 --> 01:53:02,464
Rindge weirdo

2060
01:53:02,976 --> 01:53:04,256
This is this

2061
01:53:06,048 --> 01:53:06,560
He has

2062
01:53:06,816 --> 01:53:08,864
No idea this is one of the things

2063
01:53:09,888 --> 01:53:10,400
Is that

2064
01:53:10,912 --> 01:53:11,680
Doesn't know how to

2065
01:53:12,192 --> 01:53:12,960
No and

2066
01:53:13,472 --> 01:53:14,752
Had no idea

2067
01:53:15,008 --> 01:53:16,032
He was hitting himself to

2068
01:53:16,288 --> 01:53:16,800
The wagon

2069
01:53:17,056 --> 01:53:18,080
Of somebody who would win

2070
01:53:18,848 --> 01:53:19,360
Like that

2071
01:53:20,384 --> 01:53:20,896
Really

2072
01:53:21,152 --> 01:53:23,456
Because if we are giving him

2073
01:53:23,712 --> 01:53:24,480
Even that bass

2074
01:53:24,736 --> 01:53:25,760
Cunning

2075
01:53:27,296 --> 01:53:27,808
Blackstone

2076
01:53:28,064 --> 01:53:28,576
Donald Trump

2077
01:53:28,832 --> 01:53:29,856
Because Trump

2078
01:53:30,112 --> 01:53:30,880
Was a joke

2079
01:53:32,416 --> 01:53:36,256
So so he pulled out this guy who is a man after his own heart

2080
01:53:36,512 --> 01:53:38,304
Pulling out nonsense left and right

2081
01:53:38,560 --> 01:53:39,328
Sane Bolt

2082
01:53:39,584 --> 01:53:42,144
Assuming that

2083
01:53:42,656 --> 01:53:43,424
We can dump

2084
01:53:43,680 --> 01:53:46,240
Tail together we can lose together

2085
01:53:48,288 --> 01:53:49,568
That will give us both like

2086
01:53:49,824 --> 01:53:50,848
More of a plateau

2087
01:53:51,104 --> 01:53:53,920
Just say the Dumber s*** that we have to say

2088
01:53:56,992 --> 01:53:57,504
Have to

2089
01:53:57,760 --> 01:53:58,272
Engaged

2090
01:53:58,528 --> 01:54:00,320
Well I mean it's the same thing with

2091
01:54:00,576 --> 01:54:03,904
What a lot of people have come out and said about the

2092
01:54:04,416 --> 01:54:05,696
Failed Obamacare

2093
01:54:05,952 --> 01:54:06,720
Repealing

2094
01:54:06,976 --> 01:54:10,304
Excuse me house members

2095
01:54:11,840 --> 01:54:12,352
Weed

2096
01:54:12,608 --> 01:54:13,376
Christopher this

2097
01:54:13,632 --> 01:54:14,912
When Obama was in office

2098
01:54:15,168 --> 01:54:21,312
Cuz we knew we knew it would never work

2099
01:54:21,824 --> 01:54:22,848
We can't foster like that

2100
01:54:23,104 --> 01:54:24,128
Well one of the most

2101
01:54:24,384 --> 01:54:26,176
Brutal things

2102
01:54:26,432 --> 01:54:27,200
Republican

2103
01:54:27,968 --> 01:54:28,736
Absolutely

2104
01:54:30,784 --> 01:54:33,088
It was like a One Moment of clarity

2105
01:54:33,600 --> 01:54:34,112
You know

2106
01:54:34,624 --> 01:54:36,416
In the past 8 years

2107
01:54:36,672 --> 01:54:38,464
Think we've ever done anything positive

2108
01:54:38,720 --> 01:54:44,864
I don't think we've ever done anything that advances forward to doing things down

2109
01:54:45,120 --> 01:54:45,888
Party who is

2110
01:54:46,144 --> 01:54:47,168
Trying to say no

2111
01:54:47,424 --> 01:54:48,448
If we don't

2112
01:54:48,704 --> 01:54:49,728
Do something positive

2113
01:54:50,240 --> 01:54:51,520
What are we here for

2114
01:54:53,312 --> 01:54:55,360
The thing that we've all been

2115
01:54:56,640 --> 01:54:59,200
And it seems like it's the first time he's ever even

2116
01:54:59,456 --> 01:55:00,992
Consider the possibility that

2117
01:55:01,248 --> 01:55:02,272
Is a giant pile of garbage

2118
01:55:02,528 --> 01:55:03,552
Have to look in the mirror

2119
01:55:03,808 --> 01:55:06,880
But my point is Alex I think

2120
01:55:07,136 --> 01:55:08,672
Is like those senators

2121
01:55:08,928 --> 01:55:12,000
But they actually have members but in this case

2122
01:55:12,256 --> 01:55:12,768
Accidentally

2123
01:55:13,536 --> 01:55:14,048
Obamacare

2124
01:55:15,072 --> 01:55:17,632
But he joined up with Trump cuz it's like

2125
01:55:18,144 --> 01:55:19,168
Trump is going to lose

2126
01:55:19,424 --> 01:55:20,448
I'm going to say that

2127
01:55:20,704 --> 01:55:22,240
He could destroy the globalist

2128
01:55:22,752 --> 01:55:27,616
But when he loses I can say that he was cheated out of it going

2129
01:55:29,152 --> 01:55:32,224
Exactly

2130
01:55:32,480 --> 01:55:34,784
And stay the exact same things that I say

2131
01:55:35,040 --> 01:55:39,392
Network

2132
01:55:40,672 --> 01:55:41,440
Sing floated after

2133
01:55:43,488 --> 01:55:44,000
Alex Jones

2134
01:55:44,256 --> 01:55:44,768
Have had a

2135
01:55:45,024 --> 01:55:48,096
Syndicated charge that might have been on that Network

2136
01:55:49,120 --> 01:55:52,192
Unfortunately his metaphorical Obamacare repeal

2137
01:55:54,496 --> 01:55:55,008
OSHA

2138
01:55:56,800 --> 01:56:01,408
He is not taking out the globalist the more we live in this

2139
01:56:01,664 --> 01:56:03,712
The more it seems like Trump being elected

2140
01:56:04,224 --> 01:56:04,992
Was bad

2141
01:56:05,248 --> 01:56:06,528
Everyone

2142
01:56:06,784 --> 01:56:07,296
Yeah

2143
01:56:07,808 --> 01:56:09,344
Trump include include

2144
01:56:10,112 --> 01:56:13,184
No one on the planet it turns out

2145
01:56:14,720 --> 01:56:19,584
Food is probably the only person

2146
01:56:19,840 --> 01:56:20,608
Intercourse

2147
01:56:20,864 --> 01:56:23,168
Other than other than

2148
01:56:23,424 --> 01:56:24,192
Like a

2149
01:56:28,032 --> 01:56:28,544
Encouragement

2150
01:56:28,800 --> 01:56:29,568
To commit more violent

2151
01:56:30,080 --> 01:56:31,360
White supremacist aren't getting it

2152
01:56:32,128 --> 01:56:32,640
But they want either

2153
01:56:33,408 --> 01:56:36,480
No but they're getting marketing opportunities are probably getting

2154
01:56:36,992 --> 01:56:40,064
They're probably the most Americans

2155
01:56:40,320 --> 01:56:43,904
Something you can get

2156
01:56:44,160 --> 01:56:44,672
Recruitment

2157
01:56:46,464 --> 01:56:47,744
Or at least

2158
01:56:48,256 --> 01:56:48,768
Like

2159
01:56:49,792 --> 01:56:50,816
The ability to

2160
01:56:51,072 --> 01:56:51,840
Bmore free with

2161
01:56:52,096 --> 01:56:52,864
With your idiotic

2162
01:56:53,120 --> 01:56:56,448
Even if it's in the negative even if it is against

2163
01:56:56,960 --> 01:57:00,032
The media of talking more and more about

2164
01:57:00,288 --> 01:57:01,824
People who have bigoted positions

2165
01:57:02,592 --> 01:57:06,176
Only emboldened I feel that way too

2166
01:57:06,432 --> 01:57:09,760
It's almost like they are finally realizing

2167
01:57:10,272 --> 01:57:11,552
What it feels like

2168
01:57:12,064 --> 01:57:12,576
Begay

2169
01:57:13,088 --> 01:57:13,600
Fortran

2170
01:57:15,136 --> 01:57:16,672
You know how

2171
01:57:17,184 --> 01:57:20,512
Do you know how more comfortable you are in your own skin when you don't have to

2172
01:57:21,792 --> 01:57:27,936
Owen Shroyer and Lee Ann McAdoo

2173
01:57:28,192 --> 01:57:29,984
To be in the Pussycat Dolls

2174
01:57:30,240 --> 01:57:34,336
As I like to call

2175
01:57:36,384 --> 01:57:37,664
Great

2176
01:57:37,920 --> 01:57:38,688
They're talkin to her

2177
01:57:38,944 --> 01:57:41,504
And she's describing the experience of realizing the cheese

2178
01:57:41,760 --> 01:57:42,272
Conservative

2179
01:57:42,528 --> 01:57:46,368
Exactly like gay people talk about

2180
01:57:47,648 --> 01:57:49,440
I mean can't you just make

2181
01:57:51,232 --> 01:57:51,744
Small connect

2182
01:57:54,560 --> 01:57:55,584
She supports the LGBT

2183
01:57:58,144 --> 01:58:04,288
It's a bigger issue for other people but in her case that's not

2184
01:58:04,544 --> 01:58:05,056
Do both

2185
01:58:06,592 --> 01:58:08,640
Interpretive

2186
01:58:08,896 --> 01:58:10,688
Forecast

2187
01:58:11,200 --> 01:58:12,224
If there's a

2188
01:58:12,480 --> 01:58:12,992
Full

2189
01:58:13,248 --> 01:58:13,760
Acceptance

2190
01:58:14,272 --> 01:58:16,064
Then maybe we can go back

2191
01:58:16,320 --> 01:58:17,856
Is there's a full acceptance of the LG

2192
01:58:19,136 --> 01:58:19,648
Maybe you

2193
01:58:19,904 --> 01:58:20,416
You can go back

2194
01:58:21,184 --> 01:58:22,208
Well I am a

2195
01:58:22,976 --> 01:58:25,536
Conservative and also a person who is

2196
01:58:26,560 --> 01:58:27,072
But for right

2197
01:58:27,328 --> 01:58:27,840
Now

2198
01:58:28,096 --> 01:58:29,120
All you were saying

2199
01:58:29,632 --> 01:58:31,168
Is that I am willing

2200
01:58:31,424 --> 01:58:32,448
Marginalized

2201
01:58:32,704 --> 01:58:33,728
Millions and millions of

2202
01:58:34,496 --> 01:58:35,008
I'm willing to

2203
01:58:35,264 --> 01:58:36,288
To watch them kill them

2204
01:58:37,312 --> 01:58:37,824
So I can

2205
01:58:38,080 --> 01:58:38,592
Can get taxed

2206
01:58:39,104 --> 01:58:40,384
Yep that's what you're saying

2207
01:58:41,152 --> 01:58:41,664
Later on

2208
01:58:42,432 --> 01:58:44,736
Later on after all of this

2209
01:58:44,992 --> 01:58:46,016
Are all the bigotry

2210
01:58:46,272 --> 01:58:46,784
In the world

2211
01:58:47,552 --> 01:58:48,320
Has gone away

2212
01:58:48,832 --> 01:58:51,904
Yeah then we can get back to how conservatism is

2213
01:58:52,160 --> 01:58:52,928
So never

2214
01:58:53,184 --> 01:58:58,816
Exactly

2215
01:58:59,072 --> 01:59:01,120
This is where it gets esoteric

2216
01:59:01,632 --> 01:59:03,424
Is a riddle

2217
01:59:08,800 --> 01:59:09,568
3

2218
01:59:09,824 --> 01:59:12,128
This is where he turns

2219
01:59:12,384 --> 01:59:12,896
Internal

2220
01:59:13,152 --> 01:59:13,920
And is Jeff

2221
01:59:14,432 --> 01:59:15,200
Really discovered

2222
01:59:15,456 --> 01:59:16,736
I don't know what's going on

2223
01:59:16,992 --> 01:59:18,272
Struggling

2224
01:59:18,784 --> 01:59:20,576
And then everyone tries to climb that

2225
01:59:20,832 --> 01:59:22,368
Staircase to heaven

2226
01:59:22,624 --> 01:59:26,464
Can be over other people what the hell is that

2227
01:59:31,328 --> 01:59:34,144
Bonfire knows the valleys

2228
01:59:36,448 --> 01:59:37,984
You're already in the Stars

2229
01:59:38,496 --> 01:59:42,080
Beautiful beautiful

2230
01:59:43,872 --> 01:59:44,384
And

2231
01:59:44,896 --> 01:59:47,456
Down in the valley is the highest point

2232
01:59:52,064 --> 01:59:53,344
People keep thinking they should

2233
01:59:55,904 --> 01:59:57,696
Down

2234
01:59:58,720 --> 01:59:59,232
Down

2235
02:00:00,768 --> 02:00:02,816
That mean you don't become successful

2236
02:00:03,072 --> 02:00:05,888
Wealth is to protect yourself

2237
02:00:06,144 --> 02:00:11,264
You build it's not so you can sit there like a peacock

2238
02:00:12,032 --> 02:00:12,800
Kayla Robinson

2239
02:00:13,568 --> 02:00:15,360
Because on average are so solace

2240
02:00:15,616 --> 02:00:16,640
There's something nice

2241
02:00:23,552 --> 02:00:26,112
Who's got a bigger soul

2242
02:00:26,368 --> 02:00:28,416
Who's got who's got bigger

2243
02:00:29,440 --> 02:00:30,720
What are you talkin about

2244
02:00:31,488 --> 02:00:32,256
What was that

2245
02:00:33,536 --> 02:00:35,840
You're in the valley and you realize the valley is the

2246
02:00:37,632 --> 02:00:38,144
This is

2247
02:00:39,936 --> 02:00:46,080
Like the

2248
02:00:46,336 --> 02:00:48,384
Religion

2249
02:00:50,432 --> 02:00:51,456
Junior High summer

2250
02:00:51,712 --> 02:00:52,992
Everybody

2251
02:00:53,504 --> 02:00:55,040
Everybody sleeping in the door

2252
02:00:55,296 --> 02:00:56,576
All the sudden one kid

2253
02:01:01,952 --> 02:01:03,744
Power and that's when the ship goes down

2254
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:04,512
Right

2255
02:01:05,024 --> 02:01:07,328
I don't know

2256
02:01:08,864 --> 02:01:13,216
I think that's exactly what that kid

2257
02:01:13,472 --> 02:01:14,240
Rich Sommer

2258
02:01:17,056 --> 02:01:17,824
Alex Jones

2259
02:01:19,872 --> 02:01:23,456
She got like a waiver to go to camp kanakuk

2260
02:01:26,528 --> 02:01:28,832
Yeah I'm at I went to like really rich

2261
02:01:29,088 --> 02:01:29,600
Christian

2262
02:01:30,368 --> 02:01:30,880
And I'm not

2263
02:01:33,184 --> 02:01:34,464
Work

2264
02:01:36,512 --> 02:01:37,792
That's for another day

2265
02:01:38,304 --> 02:01:41,632
This is f***** up it starts out f***** up and

2266
02:01:41,888 --> 02:01:42,912
Brujo boy

2267
02:01:43,424 --> 02:01:49,056
Slit my throat

2268
02:01:50,336 --> 02:01:51,616
I would do it there's a secret

2269
02:01:51,872 --> 02:01:53,152
Strong

2270
02:01:53,664 --> 02:01:54,432
Have

2271
02:01:54,944 --> 02:02:00,320
I will though why I have effect on them and if the people

2272
02:02:00,832 --> 02:02:02,112
Ever realize this

2273
02:02:02,368 --> 02:02:05,440
And the bushfires of Liberty

2274
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:09,536
Charging out of the Mist

2275
02:02:10,048 --> 02:02:13,632
Individuals that will be 100.

2276
02:02:14,144 --> 02:02:15,680
Right now I'm still waiting for

2277
02:02:17,728 --> 02:02:18,496
I know it's coming

2278
02:02:19,520 --> 02:02:21,056
And for the global should know this

2279
02:02:21,312 --> 02:02:23,616
Is only the first level of this event

2280
02:02:24,640 --> 02:02:26,944
It's going to get bigger

2281
02:02:27,200 --> 02:02:30,016
Stronger

2282
02:02:34,624 --> 02:02:37,696
Humans really do understand us

2283
02:02:37,952 --> 02:02:40,512
Once we have a platform to build on

2284
02:02:47,936 --> 02:02:49,472
Now

2285
02:02:49,984 --> 02:02:51,008
Auto-launch deck

2286
02:02:51,520 --> 02:02:52,032
Looks like he knows

2287
02:02:53,056 --> 02:02:59,200
Unlimited any Elite know that in there so jealous they're so angry they're so upset they don't know what to do

2288
02:02:59,712 --> 02:03:03,552
Because they're sitting around not even knowing how to use what they've got

2289
02:03:04,832 --> 02:03:06,112
Cuz they didn't develop

2290
02:03:06,880 --> 02:03:07,392
Their phone

2291
02:03:07,904 --> 02:03:08,928
Even further than we are

2292
02:03:12,768 --> 02:03:16,864
Turns into some nightmare because we've got bad people in control of those systems

2293
02:03:17,120 --> 02:03:23,264
This is why he had to cut off Steve pieczenik this is what he needed to

2294
02:03:23,520 --> 02:03:26,848
Bill his f****** time with

2295
02:03:27,360 --> 02:03:29,408
Written in the largest possible letters

2296
02:03:30,176 --> 02:03:31,456
Please go to therapy

2297
02:03:31,712 --> 02:03:33,760
Yeah

2298
02:03:34,016 --> 02:03:38,880
Alex you need analysis this is not good just

2299
02:03:39,136 --> 02:03:39,648
He is

2300
02:03:39,904 --> 02:03:40,928
Considering suicide right

2301
02:03:41,440 --> 02:03:42,976
Really what are you doing

2302
02:03:43,232 --> 02:03:45,792
It's sort of an Artful expression of it at least it is like

2303
02:03:46,048 --> 02:03:48,864
If I could if I could give of my life essay

2304
02:03:49,376 --> 02:03:50,400
To create

2305
02:03:50,912 --> 02:03:52,192
The energy that's needed

2306
02:03:52,704 --> 02:03:53,216
2

2307
02:03:53,472 --> 02:03:54,496
Stop the globalist

2308
02:03:54,752 --> 02:03:55,520
My sworn enemy

2309
02:03:55,776 --> 02:03:56,544
That I would do that

2310
02:03:56,800 --> 02:03:58,592
That's not really a threat of suicide

2311
02:03:59,104 --> 02:04:02,176
Violent language right after talking about murdering a dog

2312
02:04:02,432 --> 02:04:03,712
I swear to God

2313
02:04:03,968 --> 02:04:04,992
This is Emily dick

2314
02:04:05,504 --> 02:04:07,552
He is Emily Dickinson

2315
02:04:08,064 --> 02:04:09,344
You think so

2316
02:04:09,856 --> 02:04:10,368
This is

2317
02:04:10,624 --> 02:04:11,648
Crazy I mean

2318
02:04:13,184 --> 02:04:13,696
About like

2319
02:04:14,464 --> 02:04:15,232
This is only going

2320
02:04:16,256 --> 02:04:18,048
It's going to keep happening faster and faster

2321
02:04:18,304 --> 02:04:19,840
I agree

2322
02:04:22,144 --> 02:04:22,912
In terms of like

2323
02:04:23,168 --> 02:04:24,704
Another propaganda

2324
02:04:24,960 --> 02:04:31,104
And the way the internet is radicalizing people and stuff like that

2325
02:04:33,920 --> 02:04:36,992
That's what's going to happen he just doesn't realize that he is

2326
02:04:37,248 --> 02:04:37,760
The problem

2327
02:04:38,528 --> 02:04:41,088
It's not just make-believe group Republic

2328
02:04:41,344 --> 02:04:41,856
Thinks they're the hero

2329
02:04:42,880 --> 02:04:43,392
I don't

2330
02:04:43,904 --> 02:04:44,928
I think I'm a piece of s***

2331
02:04:45,184 --> 02:04:46,976
Fair enough yeah I do I think I might

2332
02:04:47,232 --> 02:04:51,328
Turn my own scary story is about I don't even know what the

2333
02:04:51,584 --> 02:04:52,608
My cat maybe I don't know

2334
02:04:54,400 --> 02:04:54,912
The story

2335
02:04:55,168 --> 02:04:55,680
About

2336
02:04:55,936 --> 02:04:56,704
You grown up

2337
02:04:56,960 --> 02:04:57,728
South Philly right

2338
02:04:58,752 --> 02:05:01,312
Okay

2339
02:05:01,568 --> 02:05:03,360
I never watched resperate Fresh Prince

2340
02:05:03,616 --> 02:05:04,128
Fresh Prince

2341
02:05:04,640 --> 02:05:05,920
Anyway

2342
02:05:06,176 --> 02:05:06,688
Blast

2343
02:05:06,944 --> 02:05:08,992
Clip is sort of

2344
02:05:10,016 --> 02:05:11,040
Beforehand

2345
02:05:11,296 --> 02:05:12,320
Louboutin to the 4th hour

2346
02:05:13,600 --> 02:05:14,880
And he's back talk

2347
02:05:15,392 --> 02:05:15,904
I think if they would

2348
02:05:16,160 --> 02:05:16,672
Tonight I'm not sure I

2349
02:05:20,000 --> 02:05:23,584
Oh okay talk about vaccines being bad

2350
02:05:24,096 --> 02:05:24,608
He is the word

2351
02:05:24,864 --> 02:05:28,448
The NIH is getting on Sunday

2352
02:05:30,240 --> 02:05:30,752
F*** you

2353
02:05:31,008 --> 02:05:32,032
I hate

2354
02:05:35,616 --> 02:05:36,384
Bush's Batman

2355
02:05:36,640 --> 02:05:37,152
Also

2356
02:05:37,920 --> 02:05:38,688
Picture is still not hung

2357
02:05:39,456 --> 02:05:43,552
I can confirm

2358
02:05:44,320 --> 02:05:48,160
I think I can find him on Twitter I think we could find them on Twitter

2359
02:05:48,416 --> 02:05:48,928
Vermont weather

2360
02:05:50,208 --> 02:05:50,720
I bet it

2361
02:05:51,744 --> 02:05:54,048
Chicago next week

2362
02:05:54,304 --> 02:05:55,072
We need that

2363
02:05:56,352 --> 02:05:57,888
Now my only goal

2364
02:05:58,144 --> 02:05:59,424
Like eventually if we

2365
02:05:59,680 --> 02:06:01,216
We get beyond the picture that's

2366
02:06:03,008 --> 02:06:03,776
You know

2367
02:06:04,032 --> 02:06:08,896
People and productivity circles like to talk about having actionable goals

2368
02:06:09,920 --> 02:06:14,528
You know we can't we can't we can't solve The Alex Jones and we can get that picture

2369
02:06:14,784 --> 02:06:19,392
Set around and say we want to have a great podcast that's not an actionable goal

2370
02:06:20,928 --> 02:06:21,440
I'm going to

2371
02:06:21,696 --> 02:06:24,256
To tweet at John Rappaport masterminded megapixel

2372
02:06:24,768 --> 02:06:26,304
Anyway

2373
02:06:26,560 --> 02:06:29,632
It's getting this last clip this is again he's now falling back

2374
02:06:29,888 --> 02:06:30,400
To Nunez

2375
02:06:30,912 --> 02:06:33,216
It still has some of this esoteric language in it

2376
02:06:33,472 --> 02:06:34,496
And the boys

2377
02:06:37,312 --> 02:06:42,176
Transcends from the realm of the normal man into the arena

2378
02:06:42,944 --> 02:06:43,456
Wow

2379
02:06:44,736 --> 02:06:46,016
This is f****** banana.

2380
02:06:46,272 --> 02:06:47,040
Donald Trump

2381
02:06:50,624 --> 02:06:53,440
Other people need to expired

2382
02:06:54,464 --> 02:06:58,816
It does one man to start trying to be men again and actually stand up for what's good and honorable

2383
02:07:01,888 --> 02:07:03,424
We'll have a civilization

2384
02:07:04,448 --> 02:07:08,288
Only when men start acting like real mannequin will we have a civilization

2385
02:07:08,800 --> 02:07:14,176
I feel like that's not how it works

2386
02:07:20,320 --> 02:07:22,112
Be that as it may I mean it is

2387
02:07:22,368 --> 02:07:23,904
It's good that that's where we're going to jump off

2388
02:07:24,160 --> 02:07:24,672
Because that's

2389
02:07:25,184 --> 02:07:25,696
Perfect

2390
02:07:25,952 --> 02:07:28,768
Encapsulation of a lot of Alex's life philosophy

2391
02:07:29,024 --> 02:07:31,584
You must be real men

2392
02:07:31,840 --> 02:07:37,984
Let's all be dudes bro-bro masculinity

2393
02:07:38,240 --> 02:07:38,752
Globalist

2394
02:07:42,080 --> 02:07:45,152
I don't know I don't know what's going on in Alex Jones is world of your writing needs

2395
02:07:45,408 --> 02:07:46,176
To get therapy

2396
02:07:46,688 --> 02:07:47,712
There's so much

2397
02:07:48,736 --> 02:07:50,784
There's so much going on like there's

2398
02:07:51,552 --> 02:07:53,600
Any world but like

2399
02:07:55,136 --> 02:07:57,440
Strange like up-and-down of

2400
02:07:57,696 --> 02:07:58,720
His emotional

2401
02:07:58,976 --> 02:07:59,488
Allstate

2402
02:08:01,792 --> 02:08:06,400
The interview falling apart and him turning really dark and fun topics

2403
02:08:06,656 --> 02:08:07,680
Is it is it

2404
02:08:07,936 --> 02:08:08,448
Connect it

2405
02:08:08,704 --> 02:08:14,848
Oh absolutely you're watching a psychodrama is it is a psychodrama in radio show

2406
02:08:15,104 --> 02:08:16,896
Show form episode

2407
02:08:19,200 --> 02:08:22,528
So much going on

2408
02:08:22,784 --> 02:08:27,904
A Prairie Home Companion in the two greatest what the f*** is happening

2409
02:08:32,000 --> 02:08:32,768
Infowars

2410
02:08:33,280 --> 02:08:34,560
There's so much going on

2411
02:08:35,328 --> 02:08:36,096
It's insane

2412
02:08:36,608 --> 02:08:37,632
It's never been like this

2413
02:08:38,144 --> 02:08:38,656
No this is

2414
02:08:39,168 --> 02:08:44,032
They're part of an investigation into Russian espionage

2415
02:08:44,544 --> 02:08:45,312
There

2416
02:08:45,568 --> 02:08:47,104
Apologizing for pizzagate

2417
02:08:47,872 --> 02:08:48,384
Fair

2418
02:08:49,408 --> 02:08:50,432
Lost their funding

2419
02:08:51,712 --> 02:08:53,248
It's crazy this is

2420
02:08:53,504 --> 02:08:54,272
I read once

2421
02:08:54,528 --> 02:08:56,832
Substantiate a reports that they just have to fire some people

2422
02:08:57,088 --> 02:08:59,648
Really I don't know if that's true or not but it seems

2423
02:08:59,904 --> 02:09:00,672
Triple murder

2424
02:09:00,928 --> 02:09:03,232
Yeah that that is kind of what wood makes

2425
02:09:03,744 --> 02:09:06,048
There's talk that like within the next week

2426
02:09:06,304 --> 02:09:07,072
They could be

2427
02:09:07,584 --> 02:09:08,096
Shuttering

2428
02:09:08,864 --> 02:09:11,424
No I don't think so

2429
02:09:11,680 --> 02:09:13,472
Internet speculation

2430
02:09:13,984 --> 02:09:16,544
But with all of the chaos that's going on

2431
02:09:17,824 --> 02:09:19,616
Things are going to get so excited

2432
02:09:19,872 --> 02:09:20,384
Wood

2433
02:09:21,408 --> 02:09:21,920
And I'm

2434
02:09:23,200 --> 02:09:23,968
Being one

2435
02:09:24,224 --> 02:09:24,736
Hundred percent

2436
02:09:24,992 --> 02:09:25,504
Serious right now

2437
02:09:26,272 --> 02:09:27,040
Alex Jones

2438
02:09:28,320 --> 02:09:28,832
I'm selfish

2439
02:09:29,856 --> 02:09:31,392
I'm being 100% serious

2440
02:09:31,904 --> 02:09:32,928
And I'm quoting

2441
02:09:33,440 --> 02:09:34,208
Cuz I love die.

2442
02:09:38,816 --> 02:09:41,376
Surrender

2443
02:09:41,632 --> 02:09:44,192
There will be no White Flag above his door

2444
02:09:44,704 --> 02:09:50,848
Even if it will the next item song is I'm in love and always will be

2445
02:09:51,104 --> 02:09:52,128
I will say that

2446
02:09:52,384 --> 02:09:54,688
Like a bird

2447
02:09:55,200 --> 02:09:58,016
That's nice

2448
02:09:58,272 --> 02:09:59,040
You have no worries

2449
02:10:04,928 --> 02:10:05,696
II

2450
02:10:06,208 --> 02:10:07,232
That you eat

2451
02:10:08,768 --> 02:10:10,048
Here's a more would I would say

2452
02:10:10,304 --> 02:10:10,816
Okay

2453
02:10:11,072 --> 02:10:12,096
Whether or not

2454
02:10:12,352 --> 02:10:13,120
Infowars

2455
02:10:13,632 --> 02:10:14,144
Self as

2456
02:10:14,400 --> 02:10:15,168
We know it

2457
02:10:16,448 --> 02:10:16,960
He will

2458
02:10:17,216 --> 02:10:17,984
Do a

2459
02:10:18,752 --> 02:10:19,520
4 Hour

2460
02:10:19,776 --> 02:10:21,056
YouTube video Everyday

2461
02:10:21,312 --> 02:10:24,896
He might just have to go back to his roots

2462
02:10:25,152 --> 02:10:27,200

To do what he does now

2466
02:10:34,112 --> 02:10:36,160

2467
02:10:36,416 --> 02:10:36,928

2468
02:10:37,184 --> 02:10:37,952
