Speaking of people who deserve to breed

92
00:05:39,711 --> 00:05:42,015
Hours for shoulders right there

93
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:47,135
That was just weird

94
00:05:55,583 --> 00:06:01,727

Do what the f*** happened to Alex Jones

101
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:20,159
Back in

102
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:23,743
To sign up with Donald Trump

103
00:06:25,791 --> 00:06:26,815
1

104
00:06:27,327 --> 00:06:29,631
We made no progress in terms of Donald Trump

105
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:31,679
But we did discover that Alex Jones is

106
00:06:31,935 --> 00:06:33,471
Firmly in support of Russia

107
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:34,495
And Vladimir Putin

108
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:37,311
Scary

109
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:39,359

00:06:39,615 --> 00:06:40,127
2 months

111
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:41,407
Of 2015

112
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:42,687
He has not changed

113
00:06:42,943 --> 00:06:43,711
Disposition from

114
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:46,015
I like what Trump says

115
00:06:46,271 --> 00:06:47,039
But I don't trust him

116
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:50,111
That's what he said for a very long time now

117
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:52,927
And that's where we begin that's where

118
00:06:53,183 --> 00:06:55,487
At the beginning of today's investigation

119
00:06:55,743 --> 00:06:57,023

00:06:58,047 --> 00:06:58,815
October 11th

121
00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:00,607
He does not trust

122
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:02,911
Because Trump is

123
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:04,703
Billionaire

124
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:05,983

He does

131
00:07:22,879 --> 00:07:23,647
He's not his dad

132
00:07:24,159 --> 00:07:25,439
Absolutely

133
00:07:26,975 --> 00:07:28,767

In the house

145
00:08:07,679 --> 00:08:11,263
Is that a good portion of the stuff that I cut out

146
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:13,055
Is Alex Jones replaying

147
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:14,847
Clips from The Drudge interview

148
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:16,895
And talking about how important

149
00:08:17,151 --> 00:08:18,175
That he had drugs on him

150
00:08:19,455 --> 00:08:20,223
Is ballet the whole

151
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:20,991
Timer

152
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:25,343

Encompasses

157
00:08:31,743 --> 00:08:32,255
Is everything

158
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:34,303
That Alex really wants to say about drugs

159
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,863
It's chickening how much I like Matt Drudge

160
00:08:51,711 --> 00:08:53,759

161
00:08:54,015 --> 00:08:55,039
He's helped us more

162
00:08:55,295 --> 00:08:56,831
He's helped the country more

163
00:08:57,087 --> 00:08:58,623
He's done so much good it's sickening

164
00:09:01,183 --> 00:09:07,327
For doing the town for the satellite anyways and TV stations

165

180
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:04,415
All the things that judges

00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:46,655
Let's go out going all the way back to Will Smith

195
00:10:46,911 --> 00:10:53,055
Wait is that part of wild wild west or does he do more than more than once.

196
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:54,079
Dog

197
00:10:54,847 --> 00:10:56,639
Dammit

198
00:10:58,943 --> 00:10:59,455
Nothing to mess with

199
00:10:59,967 --> 00:11:00,735
Canfield rip on the strip

200
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:05,599
Been screaming out where we love to last hit

201
00:11:06,623 --> 00:11:12,511
Alright that was fight live shows

202
00:11:12,767 --> 00:11:13,535
I could also

203
00:11:13,791 --> 00:11:16,095
The entirety of wild wild west acapella

204
00:11:19,935 --> 00:11:23,519
All donations

205
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:27,871
The body of the show

206
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:32,991
On the show The First

207
00:11:33,247 --> 00:11:34,783
Cousin interview with

208
00:11:35,551 --> 00:11:36,831
Who is the economy

209
00:11:37,087 --> 00:11:37,599
Zookeeper

210
00:11:37,855 --> 00:11:38,623
Saying that

211
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:40,671
That's Harvey Dent

212
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:42,207
You keep saying that

213
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:43,231
Economic collapse

214
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:52,191
Which was the company that was involved

215
00:11:52,703 --> 00:11:56,031
Yeah

216
00:11:57,567 --> 00:11:58,335
Dripreport

217
00:11:59,359 --> 00:12:00,127
Oh man

218
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:02,943
We figured it out his Studio isn't Austin

219
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:05,247
All right so he's on

220
00:12:05,759 --> 00:12:08,063
A month ago on the show you said that the claps

221
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:09,343
I'm going to come within days

222
00:12:10,111 --> 00:12:10,879
It did not

223
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:12,927
Here is his updated

224
00:12:17,023 --> 00:12:23,167
The pope very interesting 11 dimensions

225
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:34,943
Can we look back at the last major piece which I also call a megaphone pattern higher high

226
00:12:35,199 --> 00:12:36,223
Exit the higher high

227
00:12:36,479 --> 00:12:38,527
East Prospect

228
00:12:38,783 --> 00:12:41,599
I've been playing on your show now.

229
00:12:41,855 --> 00:12:45,695
I'll probably late next year or early 2017

230
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:55,935
You're a scientist when it comes to economics

231
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:08,223
We don't obviously know why they come at the pit but that's what I said myself

232
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:23,327
Outcomes

233
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:27,423
2050

234
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,543
What's happening

235
00:13:38,431 --> 00:13:41,503
You know this is a time where were

236
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:03,519
That's pretty interesting theory he has

237
00:14:03,775 --> 00:14:07,871
Two data points that they're drawing from 2008 and 90

238
00:14:08,127 --> 00:14:08,639
Via

239
00:14:09,151 --> 00:14:09,663
I love

240
00:14:12,223 --> 00:14:13,503
You can see their these high

241
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:15,295
And then there are these Lowe's in

242
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:16,575
And they keep getting higher at

243
00:14:16,831 --> 00:14:21,695
And lower regulated causing these bubbles

244
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:23,487
He's like no

245
00:14:23,743 --> 00:14:24,767
If the Pope

246
00:14:28,095 --> 00:14:28,863
It's a bad omen

247
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:32,703
Very that

248
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:38,847
School of Economics the people we got to rethink a lot

249
00:14:39,103 --> 00:14:39,871
Freakonomics

250
00:14:40,127 --> 00:14:40,895
They

251
00:14:41,151 --> 00:14:42,687
Made a follow-up call

252
00:14:42,943 --> 00:14:46,015
I believe in statistics

253
00:14:46,271 --> 00:14:46,783
Is known as an

254
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:49,343
Inadequate

255
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:50,111
Because

256
00:14:51,647 --> 00:14:54,719
In 1965 Pope Paul the sixth came

257
00:14:55,999 --> 00:14:56,511
The crashing

258
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:57,535
55

259
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:00,863
Came to the United States

260
00:15:01,375 --> 00:15:01,887
7 time

261
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:04,703
He came in 1979

262
00:15:08,799 --> 00:15:09,823
And 1999

263
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:12,127
None of this is all of this

264
00:15:12,383 --> 00:15:15,199
None of this is covered

265
00:15:15,455 --> 00:15:16,223
Newborn for half

266
00:15:20,063 --> 00:15:21,599
Benedict 2008

267
00:15:22,111 --> 00:15:22,879
We got that one there

268
00:15:26,975 --> 00:15:27,487
In 2007

269
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:30,047
He was

270
00:15:30,303 --> 00:15:31,327
He wasn't offering

271
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:36,959
This time April of 2008

272
00:15:37,215 --> 00:15:37,983
Siri

273
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:39,519
That's when Nazism

274
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:40,287
Started

275
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:41,567
Spreading throughout the United

276
00:15:42,335 --> 00:15:45,663
Possible and this is where really dumb economic theories

277
00:15:46,687 --> 00:15:48,735
Spreading throughout Alex Jones's death

278
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:51,807
Like I don't understand how anybody

279
00:15:52,063 --> 00:15:53,855
He literally has to datapoint

280
00:15:54,367 --> 00:15:55,135
That's it

281
00:15:57,439 --> 00:16:02,303
This is a graph that I've shown lots of people love

282
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:05,119
Visual aid

283
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:07,423
And here's when the pope visited so as we

284
00:16:08,447 --> 00:16:09,471
Also

285
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:12,031
Balls shrivel up on cows

286
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:16,127
When the pope is it

287
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:17,151
They will drink

288
00:16:17,407 --> 00:16:17,919
The balls of your

289
00:16:24,575 --> 00:16:26,879
Dum Dums on his show and allows them to

290
00:16:28,415 --> 00:16:29,695
With these idiotic predict

291
00:16:31,231 --> 00:16:31,743
Keep going

292
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:32,511
You know why you

293
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:36,863
Cuz he likes to play that game too

294
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:37,887
Here is one

295
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:44,287
Yeah he has equipped the plays about of Obama

296
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:47,871
And stuff like that

297
00:16:48,127 --> 00:16:51,455
Obama gives

298
00:16:51,711 --> 00:16:52,479
The speech about how

299
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:53,247
We need to

300
00:16:53,503 --> 00:16:54,783
Tubi

301
00:16:55,039 --> 00:16:56,319
Committed to our principles

302
00:16:56,575 --> 00:16:57,855
People who

303
00:16:58,111 --> 00:16:58,623
Hi

304
00:16:59,135 --> 00:17:00,415
Won't give an inch

305
00:17:05,535 --> 00:17:07,583
About this issue as

306
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:12,447
Absolutist

307
00:17:13,215 --> 00:17:15,007
Gun safety measures are somehow

308
00:17:16,543 --> 00:17:17,823
An assault on freedom

309
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:18,591
Communistic

310
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:20,639
My m

311
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:27,807
And stay in power for

312
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:29,855
Trevor something

313
00:17:30,111 --> 00:17:34,207
I mean the crackpot conspiracy theory

314
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:37,791
Ratified by

315
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:39,583
Elected officials and the other party

316
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:40,351
On occasion

317
00:17:58,527 --> 00:18:01,343
Machete wants

318
00:18:02,111 --> 00:18:02,879
Obama

319
00:18:03,135 --> 00:18:03,903
Janelle Gibbs

320
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:10,559
Global

321
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:15,935
Works like that

322
00:18:16,191 --> 00:18:19,007
Grandma's how big bang

323
00:18:19,519 --> 00:18:22,335
Tuesday leaders

324
00:18:22,847 --> 00:18:23,615
Here is golden

325
00:18:23,871 --> 00:18:27,199
Admittedly Obama's only been out of office for 8 months

326
00:18:27,455 --> 00:18:28,735
Recording

327
00:18:28,991 --> 00:18:30,015
So we don't know

328
00:18:30,271 --> 00:18:31,295
But

329
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:34,879
He's not made moves to become the Secretary General of the UN

330
00:18:35,391 --> 00:18:36,671
Unless you ask Larry nickel

331
00:18:37,183 --> 00:18:43,327
Larry Nichols

332
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:46,143
Shadow um

333
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:47,935
Set a reminder

334
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:51,007
By the dark un

335
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:53,055
I'm sorry I did Skip Along so fast but I

336
00:18:53,311 --> 00:18:53,823
Excited to get to

337
00:18:54,847 --> 00:18:56,383
So I want you to not talk

338
00:18:56,639 --> 00:18:58,431
Because we need to study this

339
00:18:59,455 --> 00:18:59,967
This clip

340
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:02,015
Is fascinating to me

341
00:19:02,271 --> 00:19:04,063
I had to scroll back and listen

342
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:05,343
Do it a couple times

343
00:19:05,855 --> 00:19:06,367
Because

344
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:11,231
Describe it is the anatomy of a bad comedy

345
00:19:11,743 --> 00:19:13,535
Like he's trying to upside funny

346
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:16,607
Okay his support staff isn't playing along

347
00:19:17,119 --> 00:19:17,631
I'm soaking

348
00:19:17,887 --> 00:19:18,399
He's trying

349
00:19:18,911 --> 00:19:19,423
He's trying to

350
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:20,703
Get some juice working

351
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:22,751
And it's not anywhere

352
00:19:23,263 --> 00:19:25,055
This is probably about

353
00:19:25,311 --> 00:19:26,079
2 minutes long

354
00:19:26,335 --> 00:19:27,871
Eddie just bailed

355
00:19:28,383 --> 00:19:30,175
A bail is spectacular

356
00:19:30,431 --> 00:19:33,247
So here we go

357
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:37,343
Serious news

358
00:19:37,855 --> 00:19:39,391
Actually

359
00:19:39,647 --> 00:19:40,159
Killary

360
00:19:40,415 --> 00:19:41,439
He's not sick

361
00:19:41,951 --> 00:19:44,767
She doesn't have 6 months to live some bugs her

362
00:19:48,863 --> 00:19:49,631
She's fine

363
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:53,983
In fact this was her just yesterday

364
00:19:58,591 --> 00:20:00,639
And was having some cocktails

365
00:20:00,895 --> 00:20:02,431
Some Prophets

366
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:08,063
Someone else running for office

367
00:20:08,319 --> 00:20:09,599
But she stood up to him

368
00:20:09,855 --> 00:20:12,927
In a very very dramatic

369
00:20:13,183 --> 00:20:13,951
I will

370
00:20:23,423 --> 00:20:25,471
Filthy rich off all the

371
00:20:25,983 --> 00:20:29,055
I want to come here real quick I didn't plan

372
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:30,847
Is vaping really hard

373
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:37,247
Is a video from The Dark Crystal 30 wants to play

374
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:43,647
Are.

375
00:20:43,903 --> 00:20:44,415
He's like

376
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:45,439
All right got to keep

377
00:20:45,695 --> 00:20:49,535
Describing what I think will make this funny

378
00:20:49,791 --> 00:20:51,071
Spoiler alert they don't

379
00:20:51,327 --> 00:20:52,095
Play Drake

380
00:20:52,351 --> 00:20:53,631
But even if they had

381
00:20:54,143 --> 00:20:55,679
This is such a long walk

382
00:20:55,935 --> 00:21:00,287
To get there

383
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:01,055
Workout

384
00:21:01,311 --> 00:21:02,079
Wonderful

385
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:05,151
Class Warfare

386
00:21:06,943 --> 00:21:08,991
Here you have it ladies and gentlemen

387
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:12,831
Amazing footage

388
00:21:15,647 --> 00:21:18,720
Incredibles

389
00:21:21,024 --> 00:21:23,072
You're going to

390
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,984
Who's going to have

391
00:21:30,496 --> 00:21:35,104
And other are there that they're marching

392
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,152
She was laying on a couch

393
00:21:37,408 --> 00:21:38,688
Just relaxing her feet

394
00:21:38,944 --> 00:21:39,456
From

395
00:21:39,712 --> 00:21:41,760
Hangouts show on the road

396
00:21:44,064 --> 00:21:47,648
Hahaha

397
00:21:51,488 --> 00:21:53,792
Democratic supporters

398
00:21:54,048 --> 00:21:56,096
The Beautiful People

399
00:21:56,352 --> 00:21:58,400
You can tell the girls

400
00:22:01,728 --> 00:22:03,776
Asurion.com

401
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:10,176
4 / 0

402
00:22:20,928 --> 00:22:27,072
Let's continue Us Predator

403
00:22:27,328 --> 00:22:31,168
Brown Jug

404
00:22:33,472 --> 00:22:38,592
Audio of Hillary Clinton talking over video from The Dark Crystal

405
00:22:38,848 --> 00:22:40,896
That was just a clip of Hillary Clinton speech

406
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:42,432
2 minutes

407
00:22:42,688 --> 00:22:44,992
Setup 46

408
00:22:45,504 --> 00:22:46,784
I don't know where

409
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,064
Play the wrong

410
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,088
You're totally right

411
00:22:50,112 --> 00:22:51,648
During the break

412
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:52,928
Score

413
00:22:53,184 --> 00:22:58,304
Absolutely like me

414
00:22:58,816 --> 00:22:59,328
You didn't look

415
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:02,144
One thing that I've learned from doing a lot of stand-up

416
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:05,984
As long as

417
00:23:14,944 --> 00:23:16,736
Do not at all

418
00:23:20,064 --> 00:23:21,088
Like just never happy

419
00:23:21,344 --> 00:23:24,160
That's what was supposed to happen

420
00:23:24,672 --> 00:23:30,304
Gorgeous

421
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:34,656
Alex Jones

422
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:35,424
Incapable of

423
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:38,240
Humorous that's what I'm talkin about

424
00:23:38,496 --> 00:23:40,800
Even if it had gone perfectly it wouldn't have been funny

425
00:23:42,336 --> 00:23:43,360
If you have any chopped

426
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:46,688
You should be able to try and bring some funny into the middle

427
00:23:48,224 --> 00:23:49,760
Spice it up

428
00:23:50,016 --> 00:23:51,808
Something embarrassing

429
00:23:52,064 --> 00:23:55,136
Hillary isn't

430
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:56,672
Was I supposed to say

431
00:23:57,184 --> 00:23:57,952
Alex

432
00:23:59,232 --> 00:24:02,560
She's fine

433
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:04,096
We all know that.

434
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,680
Discussing her successor

435
00:24:07,936 --> 00:24:08,960
She refused

436
00:24:11,008 --> 00:24:11,520
Amazing

437
00:24:11,776 --> 00:24:14,592
Obviously Democrats and Republicans

438
00:24:14,848 --> 00:24:17,664
Class Warfare they'll Eat the Rich

439
00:24:17,920 --> 00:24:21,760
Joe Biden

440
00:24:22,016 --> 00:24:27,904
Yeah why wouldn't because part of Larry Nichols narrative the Joe Biden was is angling to drive to

441
00:24:28,928 --> 00:24:29,952
Open create a caliphate

442
00:24:30,208 --> 00:24:32,512
And be the king of Muslims

443
00:24:32,768 --> 00:24:34,304
Who should be most angry about the

444
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:38,400
Tragedy

445
00:24:38,656 --> 00:24:40,192
Even they aren't this bad

446
00:24:40,448 --> 00:24:42,496
We commit crime

447
00:24:42,752 --> 00:24:48,896
Yeah we are

448
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:54,016
You're not a part of bad comedy 31 line we do not cost

449
00:24:58,112 --> 00:24:59,904
So if Alex

450
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:02,208
The little racist

451
00:25:02,976 --> 00:25:04,512
And then he talked about boots

452
00:25:05,024 --> 00:25:05,792
Which is fun

453
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:09,632
Always

454
00:25:09,888 --> 00:25:11,168
Get disgusted by

455
00:25:11,936 --> 00:25:14,496
Racial stereotypes and racial comments

456
00:25:16,288 --> 00:25:18,848
And pushed incessantly

457
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:20,384
Biracial

458
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:26,272
Nope

459
00:25:26,528 --> 00:25:29,600
And this is a real culture of enslavement

460
00:25:29,856 --> 00:25:30,624
Wow

461
00:25:35,488 --> 00:25:40,352
Wow

462
00:25:40,608 --> 00:25:44,192
Anybody who wants to own a company

463
00:25:51,872 --> 00:25:58,016
B b b b b suppress black people

464
00:25:58,528 --> 00:26:01,856
MTV

465
00:26:11,584 --> 00:26:17,728
They're sure pushing all this death culture

466
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:21,568
University of Pennsylvania professor

467
00:26:22,848 --> 00:26:24,384
Aneesa beutler

468
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,664
Call presidential

469
00:26:44,096 --> 00:26:45,376
Strong

470
00:26:49,984 --> 00:26:52,032
King believable it's not nearly done either

471
00:26:54,336 --> 00:26:55,104
You can't

472
00:26:55,616 --> 00:26:59,456
Rhetoric

473
00:26:59,712 --> 00:27:00,224
Literal

474
00:27:03,808 --> 00:27:06,880
Why would you use that as your comparison in this

475
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:09,696
Rhetorically

476
00:27:09,952 --> 00:27:10,464
It's dumb

477
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:15,328
About boots

478
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,888
That are somehow we've been to

479
00:27:18,912 --> 00:27:20,192
Well I mean

480
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,752
You can fly suasticas

481
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:25,312
You can fly Chinese flags you can fly

482
00:27:25,568 --> 00:27:31,456
McDonald's Flagstaff Easter Bunny

483
00:27:31,968 --> 00:27:38,112
I need

484
00:27:38,368 --> 00:27:39,136
Go to jail

485
00:27:39,392 --> 00:27:40,160
So far

486
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:41,952
Comedy

487
00:27:42,976 --> 00:27:48,352
It continues give only there was a coon of the Year award Professor Butler

488
00:27:48,608 --> 00:27:50,400
Response to another

489
00:27:50,912 --> 00:27:53,216
Lincoln

490
00:27:56,544 --> 00:28:02,688
Class Warfare

491
00:28:04,992 --> 00:28:07,040
If somebody

492
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,088
Suzanne

493
00:28:09,344 --> 00:28:10,880
Does that mean someone wearing

494
00:28:11,136 --> 00:28:13,440
Punk rock boots

495
00:28:13,696 --> 00:28:15,232
People wearing them

496
00:28:15,744 --> 00:28:16,512
A lot of them

497
00:28:20,096 --> 00:28:23,936
I was in high school I wore all sorts of cowboy boot tennis shoes

498
00:28:24,192 --> 00:28:28,032
Music

499
00:28:45,184 --> 00:28:48,768
Other skaters

500
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:51,584
Just not knowing what these symbols mean

501
00:28:55,936 --> 00:28:57,728
People parading around

502
00:29:05,152 --> 00:29:07,712
Martin's Indian School

503
00:29:07,968 --> 00:29:08,480
Yeah I got it

504
00:29:09,504 --> 00:29:10,272
Got it all right

505
00:29:12,576 --> 00:29:13,088
Got a phuc

506
00:29:14,368 --> 00:29:16,160
Going to be asked if you're not see

507
00:29:16,416 --> 00:29:17,696
Going to get your ass kicked by skate

508
00:29:17,952 --> 00:29:21,280
Yeah also sorry that there was some jumps there

509
00:29:21,536 --> 00:29:24,096
Problem with my recording I don't know what happened there was a little glitchy

510
00:29:26,912 --> 00:29:27,936
Some sixteen-year-old girls wanted

511
00:29:28,448 --> 00:29:29,984
We got the point of it

512
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,544
Over 150 sixteen-year-old girl

513
00:29:38,944 --> 00:29:39,456
I guess

514
00:29:39,968 --> 00:29:42,016
Having a Confederate flag doesn't make you a ray

515
00:29:47,136 --> 00:29:50,720
Discounting out of whole cloth it's like

516
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,024
Vista set

517
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:53,792
Of people

518
00:29:54,304 --> 00:29:55,584
Confederate flag

519
00:29:56,096 --> 00:29:58,656
The percentage of that

520
00:29:59,424 --> 00:30:00,192
I'm going to go with 9

521
00:30:01,216 --> 00:30:02,496
Whatever it is

522
00:30:02,752 --> 00:30:04,800
I'm not sure if it's that high but I'm sure

523
00:30:05,312 --> 00:30:06,592
Sure it is

524
00:30:06,848 --> 00:30:09,664
Whatever the number is it statistically relevant

525
00:30:10,176 --> 00:30:12,224
Oh yeah over the general population

526
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,016
In the same way with Doc Martin

527
00:30:14,528 --> 00:30:16,320
Statistically relevant there's more.

528
00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:21,696
You should be judged on those stereotypes

529
00:30:21,952 --> 00:30:23,232
Unless you have

530
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:25,280
Confederate flag

531
00:30:25,792 --> 00:30:26,304
Today

532
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:31,936
Proof is on the defendant in that particular

533
00:30:32,448 --> 00:30:32,960
Interest

534
00:30:34,496 --> 00:30:35,520
So

535
00:30:36,288 --> 00:30:37,056
On the last episode

536
00:30:37,824 --> 00:30:39,104
Alex Jones

537
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,896
If he had gone to his head

538
00:30:41,408 --> 00:30:41,920
He was being

539
00:30:42,432 --> 00:30:43,968
Approached by a shooter

540
00:30:46,016 --> 00:30:47,552
He would lie to him and say that he wasn't

541
00:30:47,808 --> 00:30:49,344
Christian

542
00:30:50,880 --> 00:30:52,160
Wildly again scripture

543
00:30:53,696 --> 00:30:55,232
Jesus and the Bible

544
00:30:55,488 --> 00:30:58,304
Very clearly say

545
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:04,448
It's me or you pretend you don't know me I will pretend I do not know you in front of my father

546
00:31:04,704 --> 00:31:06,496
Is a myth perpetuated by

547
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:10,336
Certainly least the Columbine watch for sure

548
00:31:12,896 --> 00:31:15,456
This episode

549
00:31:15,712 --> 00:31:16,224
Episode

550
00:31:16,736 --> 00:31:17,248
Caller

551
00:31:18,784 --> 00:31:19,296
What we say

552
00:31:21,344 --> 00:31:22,880
You are way out of line saying

553
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,952
Is really f*****

554
00:31:26,464 --> 00:31:28,512
I can't believe you would say that

555
00:31:29,024 --> 00:31:29,792
Alex is like

556
00:31:30,816 --> 00:31:31,328
Alright

557
00:31:31,584 --> 00:31:32,608
You're right you're right

558
00:31:32,864 --> 00:31:35,680
Sorry sorry

559
00:31:36,704 --> 00:31:40,800
As long as I don't have anything from the call

560
00:31:41,056 --> 00:31:43,360
But in the end is like look I'm so honest

561
00:31:43,616 --> 00:31:45,152
That I'm even honest about my lying

562
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:47,968
Nice save

563
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,504
But then he says this

564
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:50,272
Which I think is it

565
00:31:50,528 --> 00:31:51,552
Incredibly telling

566
00:31:51,808 --> 00:31:54,112
This next clip is like something that

567
00:31:54,624 --> 00:31:56,416
I don't think he knows what he's saying

568
00:31:56,672 --> 00:31:57,696
Because he's making

569
00:31:57,952 --> 00:31:59,488
Some of our arguments for us

570
00:32:01,024 --> 00:32:03,840
This is literally off to be weird out of Alex Jones's mouth

571
00:32:04,096 --> 00:32:04,608
Well that's awesome

572
00:32:07,424 --> 00:32:07,936
We get to do this

573
00:32:13,824 --> 00:32:15,360
Of news and information

574
00:32:19,712 --> 00:32:20,480
Wrong

575
00:32:23,296 --> 00:32:27,392
Yep he's right

576
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,536
How your call surgery call

577
00:32:33,792 --> 00:32:34,304
What are the reason

578
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:35,584
He has that town is he

579
00:32:43,264 --> 00:32:44,032
About music

580
00:32:46,336 --> 00:32:48,896
But I wasn't back to episode

581
00:32:49,152 --> 00:32:50,944
He says that are wrong

582
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:54,272
I hear a bunch of times but he says things that are you misspeak

583
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:55,552
All the time

584
00:32:55,808 --> 00:32:57,088
The only difference

585
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:02,720
Is it he's blaming like I look everybody else would screw up more than me I don't have a teleprompter

586
00:33:04,256 --> 00:33:05,280
I think we screwed up

587
00:33:05,536 --> 00:33:06,304
Weight loss from him

588
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:07,840
I mean

589
00:33:09,376 --> 00:33:12,448
Actually probably also also this

590
00:33:12,704 --> 00:33:14,752
This game is playing where he's like I misspeak

591
00:33:15,264 --> 00:33:18,080
Stuff like this is actually a really generous version of

592
00:33:18,336 --> 00:33:19,872
Because the truth is that he's lying

593
00:33:20,384 --> 00:33:21,664
It's not that you miss

594
00:33:22,688 --> 00:33:23,456
Legitimately

595
00:33:23,712 --> 00:33:25,760
And intentionally lying about what people

596
00:33:26,016 --> 00:33:26,528
Blur saying

597
00:33:26,784 --> 00:33:30,624
What liberal causes if you are on the right

598
00:33:31,648 --> 00:33:32,672
Red handed in Ally

599
00:33:33,184 --> 00:33:33,952
You will absolutely

600
00:33:35,232 --> 00:33:37,280
There is no way that you'll be like

601
00:33:37,792 --> 00:33:39,072
Oh yeah yeah

602
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:42,400
My bad no time for introspection dr. Jones

603
00:33:42,656 --> 00:33:47,264
No thank you

604
00:33:47,776 --> 00:33:48,288
The dentist

605
00:33:48,544 --> 00:33:49,824
The CIA

606
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:50,592
Cuz I was

607
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:51,872
Does not have a doctor

608
00:33:52,128 --> 00:33:52,896
As opposed

609
00:33:53,152 --> 00:33:53,664
2nd

610
00:33:54,688 --> 00:33:55,968
Who has a

611
00:33:56,224 --> 00:33:56,992
A PhD in

612
00:33:59,808 --> 00:34:02,624
Good trivia

613
00:34:03,136 --> 00:34:04,672
In case you're out of the car

614
00:34:04,928 --> 00:34:05,952
The bike down 45 minutes

615
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,608
There's not a whole lot more in there we need

616
00:34:12,864 --> 00:34:13,632
Need to get to nothing

617
00:34:15,424 --> 00:34:16,448
Squeeze out of that

618
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:17,472
Chestnut

619
00:34:17,728 --> 00:34:19,520
October 8th

620
00:34:21,568 --> 00:34:23,104
The stretch of time where Alex Jones

621
00:34:23,616 --> 00:34:24,128
Is doing a

622
00:34:24,384 --> 00:34:25,152
Honda of impression

623
00:34:25,664 --> 00:34:27,200
Bombshell

624
00:34:27,456 --> 00:34:28,736
He's trying to put together a real

625
00:34:28,992 --> 00:34:32,064
I think he wants to get on SNL I don't know what's going on

626
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,344
But he does long impression

627
00:34:34,112 --> 00:34:35,136
And this is the first one

628
00:34:35,392 --> 00:34:36,160
I think

629
00:34:36,672 --> 00:34:38,208
It's supposed to be an impression of

630
00:34:38,464 --> 00:34:38,976
How

631
00:34:39,232 --> 00:34:41,024
From space

632
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:43,072
I think that's supposed to be

633
00:34:43,328 --> 00:34:44,352
We can beat them

634
00:34:46,144 --> 00:34:48,448
Freaked out about in Congress that's why they said

635
00:34:48,704 --> 00:34:52,288
MSNBC

636
00:34:53,056 --> 00:34:55,616
Every week

637
00:35:00,736 --> 00:35:02,528
Discredit yourself Republicans

638
00:35:07,904 --> 00:35:10,464
In 2001 Space Odyssey

639
00:35:12,768 --> 00:35:15,072
Don't do that Captain please stop

640
00:35:15,584 --> 00:35:16,608
Letchworth fish

641
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:18,400
Really

642
00:35:18,656 --> 00:35:22,752
Want to do that

643
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:28,640
I tell you you're going to lose you

644
00:35:40,416 --> 00:35:43,488
Are Momo's

645
00:35:59,872 --> 00:36:01,152

646
00:36:01,408 --> 00:36:07,552
1954

647
00:36:11,904 --> 00:36:15,232
New York

648
00:36:19,840 --> 00:36:24,448
How is your day going I don't know

649
00:36:35,968 --> 00:36:40,576
I just like that at me over just like that

650
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:49,536
I think that the daisy thing there has to be some

651
00:36:49,792 --> 00:36:52,096
He's trying to give like

652
00:36:52,352 --> 00:36:55,680
A message to the boys back home or something like that I don't know

653
00:36:57,472 --> 00:36:58,496
There's no way

654
00:37:01,824 --> 00:37:02,336
The song

655
00:37:09,248 --> 00:37:12,064
A member of the 88

656
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:14,880
You don't know who I David Rockefeller

657
00:37:16,928 --> 00:37:17,696
Is it is it

658
00:37:18,976 --> 00:37:22,304
Hopalong my darling Build Me Up Buttercup

659
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:24,864
Okay

660
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:27,680
Can you woo woo woo by Jeffrey Osborne

661
00:37:27,936 --> 00:37:31,520
Next clip

662
00:37:31,776 --> 00:37:34,592
Being a f*****-up

663
00:37:34,848 --> 00:37:37,408
Depression

664
00:37:37,664 --> 00:37:40,224
Start a hierarchy of things Alex Jones like

665
00:37:42,528 --> 00:37:48,672
Breaking in this area we learned that Alex Jones like something more than the

666
00:37:49,184 --> 00:37:49,952
He's in the middle of

667
00:37:52,256 --> 00:37:53,280
This is really weird

668
00:37:53,536 --> 00:37:55,584
You doing the top 10 Center

669
00:37:56,096 --> 00:37:56,864
Galveston

670
00:37:57,376 --> 00:37:58,400
Stunning

671
00:37:59,424 --> 00:37:59,936
Kiro

672
00:38:00,704 --> 00:38:04,544
Kanye West and all these stupid stunts

673
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,848
Kanye West is stupid

674
00:38:07,104 --> 00:38:09,408
Is stupid

675
00:38:09,664 --> 00:38:10,688
Game of Thrones

676
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,736
This is the false culture

677
00:38:16,576 --> 00:38:18,624
It's so good

678
00:38:29,376 --> 00:38:31,424
Potbelly pedophile

679
00:38:32,448 --> 00:38:35,520
Stop playing around

680
00:38:39,104 --> 00:38:42,176
I just can't take it anymore

681
00:38:42,432 --> 00:38:43,456
It's so sick

682
00:38:43,712 --> 00:38:44,224
It showed

683
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:45,248
Degenerate

684
00:38:46,784 --> 00:38:52,928
Guitar

685
00:39:04,192 --> 00:39:05,216
You just have to

686
00:39:05,728 --> 00:39:06,752
Guitar

687
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:14,432
Anything else

688
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:21,600
Never be more clear that you just filling time with random non-sequiturs

689
00:39:21,856 --> 00:39:23,904
From his like catalog of villain

690
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:38,752
The boy

691
00:39:39,264 --> 00:39:41,056
So that is one part of the hierarchy

692
00:39:41,312 --> 00:39:43,360
I'm guessing you would never reference

693
00:39:47,712 --> 00:39:51,808
Guitarist

694
00:39:52,064 --> 00:39:55,648
This guitar is race pimping

695
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:59,744
If we find out what Alex Jones likes even more

696
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,304
Then not Randy Rhoads playing guitar

697
00:40:09,728 --> 00:40:11,520
Can live in peace

698
00:40:11,776 --> 00:40:13,056
Either not political

699
00:40:13,312 --> 00:40:14,336
Impala ancient

700
00:40:14,592 --> 00:40:15,360
Judaism

701
00:40:16,896 --> 00:40:17,408
I know all that

702
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:23,296
Israel's wrong turkeys

703
00:40:23,552 --> 00:40:24,320
America strong

704
00:40:24,832 --> 00:40:27,648
Who's not wrong is Russia

705
00:40:27,904 --> 00:40:34,048
. starting

706
00:40:34,816 --> 00:40:37,632
Respond

707
00:40:39,168 --> 00:40:40,704
I'm not giving up

708
00:40:44,544 --> 00:40:46,592
Do you think that if you just watch Russian

709
00:40:46,848 --> 00:40:47,616
Intellivision

710
00:40:48,128 --> 00:40:50,176
He just wants Russian media you would definitely

711
00:40:50,944 --> 00:40:55,552
I mean you could describe using them as a sort of

712
00:40:55,808 --> 00:40:59,648
You don't have given it up to the goat

713
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:11,680
Pro-russia umbrella

714
00:41:12,448 --> 00:41:14,240
Which should be

715
00:41:14,496 --> 00:41:17,312
A big red flag for what we know ends up happening

716
00:41:17,568 --> 00:41:19,360
In a few months after this point

717
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:21,920
Yeah yeah

718
00:41:23,712 --> 00:41:26,272
I don't want to I don't want to pull any sort of like

719
00:41:26,528 --> 00:41:27,040
American Nash

720
00:41:27,296 --> 00:41:28,064
Nationalism

721
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,088
Like that

722
00:41:29,344 --> 00:41:30,880
If you are a politician

723
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:36,256
Serious right

724
00:41:36,512 --> 00:41:42,656
Debate stage

725
00:41:43,936 --> 00:41:47,264
So earlier he was on the show talking about how the pope is going

726
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:48,800
To bring an omen

727
00:41:49,312 --> 00:41:49,824
Beforeitsnews

728
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:53,407
Is going to bring an omen of

729
00:41:55,199 --> 00:41:57,247
To talk a little bit about economic collapse

730
00:41:57,759 --> 00:41:58,783
But he wants to tell you how he

731
00:41:59,039 --> 00:41:59,551
He's right

732
00:42:00,063 --> 00:42:00,831
All the time

733
00:42:04,927 --> 00:42:05,951
Essence back to the show and realize

734
00:42:06,207 --> 00:42:06,719
Is that what he said was

735
00:42:07,231 --> 00:42:10,815
What what's interesting is in this clip he pretends but he's only ever made one

736
00:42:11,071 --> 00:42:13,887
Prediction about financial class which is great

737
00:42:14,143 --> 00:42:16,703
How dare you associate with Alex

738
00:42:17,215 --> 00:42:20,543
Conspiracy

739
00:42:23,615 --> 00:42:24,895
This

740
00:42:26,431 --> 00:42:27,711
A couple years ago

741
00:42:27,967 --> 00:42:33,087
Any

742
00:42:34,623 --> 00:42:36,159
We're just covering

743
00:42:37,183 --> 00:42:39,487
We told you forced inoculations were coming

744
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:43,583
They haven't

745
00:42:45,119 --> 00:42:46,911
Coming up

746
00:42:48,191 --> 00:42:50,239
Before we go any further

747
00:42:52,031 --> 00:42:52,799
We are offering

748
00:42:53,055 --> 00:42:57,663
Free specials right now

749
00:42:58,943 --> 00:43:02,783
Water filtration systems

750
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:05,599
To confirm that we no longer have big Berkey in the house

751
00:43:06,879 --> 00:43:09,183
Company

752
00:43:11,231 --> 00:43:13,535
Play Justin the time that we've been covering

753
00:43:13,791 --> 00:43:17,119
Alex Jones has shifted his prediction about economic collapse at least

754
00:43:17,375 --> 00:43:17,887
3 *

755
00:43:18,399 --> 00:43:23,519
It started in the summer

756
00:43:23,775 --> 00:43:26,079
He's pretending that years ago he's like

757
00:43:26,335 --> 00:43:28,639
The collapse is going to come into winter 2015

758
00:43:28,895 --> 00:43:29,407
I guess what

759
00:43:29,663 --> 00:43:30,175
Didn't

760
00:43:33,503 --> 00:43:35,039
So all this is wrong

761
00:43:36,575 --> 00:43:38,111
It's factually wrong this time

762
00:43:38,879 --> 00:43:40,415
It's intellectually dishonest

763
00:43:40,671 --> 00:43:42,463
Reframe to say that

764
00:43:43,487 --> 00:43:46,559
August talking about reality

765
00:43:46,815 --> 00:43:47,327
Really

766
00:43:48,351 --> 00:43:49,375
Horse vaccines are coming

767
00:43:54,495 --> 00:43:55,007
Guns from violin

768
00:43:55,263 --> 00:43:56,543
Criminal

769
00:43:58,591 --> 00:44:00,639
I'll be there in Mesa

770
00:44:01,151 --> 00:44:01,663
Clearon vaccine

771
00:44:04,479 --> 00:44:05,247
But you don't f****** know

772
00:44:07,807 --> 00:44:08,575
On the 8th

773
00:44:08,831 --> 00:44:09,599
On October 8th

774
00:44:09,855 --> 00:44:13,183
We're like I just got forced inoculated

775
00:44:14,207 --> 00:44:17,279
Larry Nichols dropped by the show on October 8th

776
00:44:19,839 --> 00:44:20,351
Details Alex

777
00:44:20,607 --> 00:44:21,887
But she almost died

778
00:44:22,143 --> 00:44:22,655
Because of some shots

779
00:44:23,423 --> 00:44:25,983
The real serious business

780
00:44:28,031 --> 00:44:31,359
Chops don't blame shot

781
00:44:31,615 --> 00:44:35,455
You have lung cancer and in the f****** video that they play with in the documentary

782
00:44:35,711 --> 00:44:36,479
You smoking a cigarette

783
00:44:42,111 --> 00:44:44,927
I don't disagree with that and I'm not judging anyone for their choices

784
00:44:45,183 --> 00:44:46,463
But if you want to talk about

785
00:44:46,719 --> 00:44:50,047
Xvid why to you in terms of health

786
00:44:50,303 --> 00:44:51,839
And you're smoking

787
00:44:52,095 --> 00:44:53,119
Cigarettes with lung cancer

788
00:44:53,375 --> 00:44:56,959
Maybe it's on you baby you are really unhealthy

789
00:44:57,215 --> 00:44:59,007
And I'm drinking

790
00:44:59,263 --> 00:44:59,775
Faygo

791
00:45:04,127 --> 00:45:07,967
IFixit Larry Nichols is probably in the clubhouse for worst dude I've ever heard of

792
00:45:08,479 --> 00:45:12,831
Like even worse than Alex Jones I think Larry Nichols sucks way harder

793
00:45:14,111 --> 00:45:15,135
And we need to call him back

794
00:45:15,391 --> 00:45:16,415
I get some point cuz I

795
00:45:16,671 --> 00:45:17,951
The list of questioning

796
00:45:18,463 --> 00:45:18,975
Questions

797
00:45:19,231 --> 00:45:19,743
Piling up

798
00:45:19,999 --> 00:45:21,023
Yeah

799
00:45:23,327 --> 00:45:24,095
My contacts list

800
00:45:24,351 --> 00:45:24,863
Looks good

801
00:45:25,375 --> 00:45:31,519
Give me a text it's probably a house phone it's probably a house phone we do that

802
00:45:32,031 --> 00:45:34,591
I'm so in this that in his first clip of Larry Nichols

803
00:45:34,847 --> 00:45:35,871
He

804
00:45:36,127 --> 00:45:39,199
Continues the Infowars tradition of making a ship prediction

805
00:45:42,015 --> 00:45:43,039
Phrased delightfully

806
00:45:43,295 --> 00:45:44,575
It's like a down-home

807
00:45:44,831 --> 00:45:45,855
All shucks

808
00:45:46,111 --> 00:45:47,135
It's kind of affliction

809
00:45:47,391 --> 00:45:48,671
Free prediction

810
00:45:49,695 --> 00:45:50,207
Sucks

811
00:45:58,655 --> 00:46:04,799
Kids and everything in it

812
00:46:08,639 --> 00:46:11,199
Remember When

813
00:46:13,759 --> 00:46:15,807
Benjamin Netanyahu

814
00:46:21,183 --> 00:46:23,743
That Obama was setting up

815
00:46:31,167 --> 00:46:33,215
Yeah you don't outside caliphate

816
00:46:34,495 --> 00:46:35,007
Yep

817
00:46:35,519 --> 00:46:37,055
I'm sure as we all know

818
00:46:38,335 --> 00:46:40,127
Sunni and Shiite

819
00:46:40,895 --> 00:46:41,919
Are getting along great

820
00:46:42,175 --> 00:46:42,943
Right now

821
00:46:43,199 --> 00:46:44,223
Team up under Obama

822
00:46:44,479 --> 00:46:46,015
Thunder

823
00:46:49,343 --> 00:46:52,159
Personally led to bombing in murdering so many

824
00:46:52,415 --> 00:46:55,231
Are the the problems with

825
00:46:55,487 --> 00:46:57,023
That 30 seconds of Larry Nichols

826
00:47:03,167 --> 00:47:06,495
He is not a duck at this point and his prediction has not come

827
00:47:06,751 --> 00:47:09,055
HonorBound

828
00:47:09,311 --> 00:47:10,335
To now become a duck

829
00:47:10,591 --> 00:47:13,663
He has been taking a lot of

830
00:47:14,175 --> 00:47:19,039
Duck-billed faces

831
00:47:19,295 --> 00:47:22,879
Human bills on their face

832
00:47:26,207 --> 00:47:27,999
Is to get these bills off of our faces

833
00:47:28,255 --> 00:47:29,023
They're right

834
00:47:32,351 --> 00:47:33,375
I love that unfrozen

835
00:47:33,631 --> 00:47:34,655
In caveman lawyer as

836
00:47:35,167 --> 00:47:40,543
Now your daughter no more guilty than my client

837
00:47:40,799 --> 00:47:41,311
To be a duck

838
00:47:42,335 --> 00:47:44,383
Frozen

839
00:47:51,807 --> 00:47:52,575
Here in Beulah

840
00:47:53,087 --> 00:47:53,855
Now I'm not

841
00:47:56,927 --> 00:48:01,535
Now let me tell you

842
00:48:09,471 --> 00:48:11,007
That we talk

843
00:48:13,567 --> 00:48:14,079
Ferret

844
00:48:14,335 --> 00:48:16,639
Civil non-civil facetory

845
00:48:16,895 --> 00:48:19,199
International asset forfeiture

846
00:48:21,503 --> 00:48:22,271
On this show

847
00:48:22,527 --> 00:48:23,039
He comes

848
00:48:23,295 --> 00:48:24,575
More Muslims

849
00:48:25,087 --> 00:48:27,391
He does this

850
00:48:27,647 --> 00:48:30,463
His big narrative that he's coming to pitch on this episode

851
00:48:30,719 --> 00:48:31,999
Is super weird

852
00:48:32,511 --> 00:48:33,279
Larry Nichols has

853
00:48:33,535 --> 00:48:34,815
Completed his transformation

854
00:48:35,071 --> 00:48:36,095
Not into duck

855
00:48:36,607 --> 00:48:37,375
But into a

856
00:48:37,631 --> 00:48:41,471
Beer Chain Letter your grandma might sing

857
00:48:41,727 --> 00:48:43,007
Ridiculous Bowl

858
00:48:43,519 --> 00:48:45,567
It's about his friend who was a mechanic

859
00:48:46,079 --> 00:48:47,359
Keep that in mind that it starts

860
00:48:48,127 --> 00:48:50,431
Muslims have no more fitting

861
00:48:52,735 --> 00:48:53,503
Mechanic is fit

862
00:48:54,271 --> 00:48:54,783
Text Mai Tran

863
00:49:01,695 --> 00:49:02,207
Dieter

864
00:49:02,463 --> 00:49:04,511
Owner

865
00:49:04,767 --> 00:49:05,535
Your dealership

866
00:49:16,799 --> 00:49:17,311
Flags

867
00:49:17,823 --> 00:49:18,847
Is war flag

868
00:49:19,359 --> 00:49:25,503
Mica Battle Flag

869
00:49:32,159 --> 00:49:33,439
Obvious

870
00:49:33,951 --> 00:49:35,231
Al-Qaeda flag

871
00:49:36,511 --> 00:49:37,279
No it's not

872
00:49:37,535 --> 00:49:40,863
That literally fighting out

873
00:49:41,631 --> 00:49:42,143
Yesterday

874
00:49:43,167 --> 00:49:43,935
And

875
00:49:45,215 --> 00:49:47,007
With your permission

876
00:49:53,151 --> 00:49:55,967
It's risky for the people that saw it you know that

877
00:49:56,479 --> 00:49:58,271
Nope

878
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:00,831
Danger

879
00:50:10,303 --> 00:50:11,071
Caliphate

880
00:50:11,327 --> 00:50:12,607
He goes on to say like

881
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:15,935
Government won't do anything about it

882
00:50:16,191 --> 00:50:16,959
Cousin

883
00:50:17,471 --> 00:50:18,495
This is nonsense

884
00:50:19,007 --> 00:50:20,543
This is a gossip story

885
00:50:21,823 --> 00:50:22,335
Alright

886
00:50:26,687 --> 00:50:27,455
Sure first question

887
00:50:27,711 --> 00:50:32,319
You are a member of Isis

888
00:50:32,831 --> 00:50:34,623
Successful owner of

889
00:50:34,879 --> 00:50:38,719
Three major dealership right right

890
00:50:38,975 --> 00:50:40,511
Yeah

891
00:50:41,791 --> 00:50:43,327
Even though I know I'm supposed to

892
00:50:43,583 --> 00:50:47,167
Flag all the time

893
00:50:47,423 --> 00:50:53,567
Chase down another car and I raised it like the skull and crossbones above in case someone thinks

894
00:50:54,079 --> 00:50:55,103
Vacation Olympic

895
00:50:55,615 --> 00:51:01,503
That you're like you going to Isis territory or something like that

896
00:51:02,527 --> 00:51:05,855
Yeah I think it's just like when you get pulled over

897
00:51:06,111 --> 00:51:10,207
You just open up the

898
00:51:10,463 --> 00:51:11,743
Stration but I got a little bit

899
00:51:18,655 --> 00:51:22,239
You go along now Bo

900
00:51:24,031 --> 00:51:24,799
It's the stupidest talking

901
00:51:25,055 --> 00:51:28,127
Story I've ever heard and let's imagine a scenario where

902
00:51:28,383 --> 00:51:29,151
It is true

903
00:51:29,663 --> 00:51:30,175
I don't care

904
00:51:31,199 --> 00:51:33,503
In the same way that Alex

905
00:51:35,807 --> 00:51:39,135
To have a Confederate flag

906
00:51:39,391 --> 00:51:42,207
Some Flags is distasteful

907
00:51:42,463 --> 00:51:43,231
Sure

908
00:51:43,487 --> 00:51:46,047
I'm fine with it I don't care

909
00:51:46,303 --> 00:51:46,815
I don't think

910
00:51:47,071 --> 00:51:47,583
Having a nice

911
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:50,655
That you are a part of Isis

912
00:51:51,167 --> 00:51:52,191
Write a Sandpoint

913
00:51:52,703 --> 00:51:54,751
My friends had when we were 18

914
00:51:56,799 --> 00:51:58,847
No but we had a flagpole out front

915
00:51:59,359 --> 00:51:59,871
And we had a

916
00:52:00,127 --> 00:52:01,663
P o w m i a flag

917
00:52:02,687 --> 00:52:03,455
In the service

918
00:52:04,991 --> 00:52:05,503
I don't know

919
00:52:07,551 --> 00:52:08,319
Like it doesn't mean anything

920
00:52:10,111 --> 00:52:10,879
There's also that

921
00:52:11,135 --> 00:52:12,927
Nichols has no details

922
00:52:13,183 --> 00:52:13,951
And I just

923
00:52:14,463 --> 00:52:14,975
It's just

924
00:52:15,231 --> 00:52:16,255
Grandpa fear God

925
00:52:17,279 --> 00:52:17,791
Flagpole

926
00:52:18,559 --> 00:52:19,327
And what we would do it

927
00:52:20,351 --> 00:52:20,863
Steal other people's

928
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:21,887
People short

929
00:52:22,143 --> 00:52:22,911
Khaki shorts

930
00:52:23,935 --> 00:52:24,447
To the top of the fly

931
00:52:25,983 --> 00:52:27,519
May have been a Nickelodeon show

932
00:52:27,775 --> 00:52:29,567
Camp anawanna

933
00:52:30,847 --> 00:52:31,871
We hold you in our heart

934
00:52:32,127 --> 00:52:33,663
What do you think about you

935
00:52:34,943 --> 00:52:41,087
Make us one of art reference

936
00:52:41,343 --> 00:52:43,903
When I get to hang out with Donkey Lips

937
00:52:45,183 --> 00:52:45,695
Budnik

938
00:52:46,463 --> 00:52:48,511
Remember the girl's name there's a true Madness

939
00:52:48,767 --> 00:52:49,279
Salute Your Shorts

940
00:52:50,815 --> 00:52:53,119
5 years ago maybe 10 years ago and

941
00:52:53,375 --> 00:52:55,423
No

942
00:52:55,935 --> 00:52:56,447
Pete doesn't

943
00:52:56,703 --> 00:52:59,775
Does all you dorks

944
00:53:00,031 --> 00:53:03,615
Even the first run sucks

945
00:53:04,383 --> 00:53:06,943
It's kind of fun to go back and watch a video

946
00:53:07,967 --> 00:53:09,247
It's a fever

947
00:53:09,759 --> 00:53:11,039
Yeah it's like a hallucinogenic

948
00:53:11,295 --> 00:53:11,807
Kind of shell

949
00:53:15,135 --> 00:53:16,415
This is this writing

950
00:53:18,463 --> 00:53:21,791
No way I remember being a huge fan of

951
00:53:22,047 --> 00:53:23,839
Were they all become lifeguards on the beach

952
00:53:27,935 --> 00:53:29,983
That was a couple episode

953
00:53:31,519 --> 00:53:32,799
Leah Remini

954
00:53:33,055 --> 00:53:34,335
What's on

955
00:53:34,591 --> 00:53:36,383
But yeah she was like her dad

956
00:53:36,639 --> 00:53:38,431
Beach Club

957
00:53:40,479 --> 00:53:41,247
Probably

958
00:53:43,807 --> 00:53:44,319
Squad Warfare

959
00:53:44,575 --> 00:53:45,855
Larry Nichols

960
00:53:46,367 --> 00:53:47,903
On the beach house I don't know

961
00:53:49,951 --> 00:53:50,975
Versation about

962
00:53:51,999 --> 00:53:53,023
Just emailed the state of the world

963
00:53:54,303 --> 00:53:58,655
Ends of advocating for something that I never would have thought I'd hear him say on air

964
00:53:59,167 --> 00:54:00,447
This is something they like

965
00:54:00,959 --> 00:54:03,775
It's hard for us to get surprised listening to Alex

966
00:54:04,031 --> 00:54:06,079
But this this clip legitimately surprised

967
00:54:27,071 --> 00:54:27,839
Talked about

968
00:54:33,215 --> 00:54:34,751
That they can just have two states

969
00:54:35,007 --> 00:54:36,287
Control

970
00:54:40,127 --> 00:54:41,407
Once it was back under control

971
00:54:53,183 --> 00:54:56,511
I never would have thought I'd hear him legitimately just straight-up say that

972
00:54:56,767 --> 00:54:57,279
States

973
00:54:59,071 --> 00:54:59,839
Pretty far

974
00:55:00,095 --> 00:55:01,375
That's pretty

975
00:55:01,887 --> 00:55:03,423
That's out there even for Alex

976
00:55:04,703 --> 00:55:06,239
I think so yeah

977
00:55:09,311 --> 00:55:09,823
Feel like Alex

978
00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:10,847
Is leaning towards

979
00:55:11,103 --> 00:55:11,615
Secede

980
00:55:12,639 --> 00:55:15,711
Like it's be unspoken thing at ever at the end of every set

981
00:55:17,247 --> 00:55:18,015
All of our

982
00:55:18,271 --> 00:55:21,599
Country run by globalist

983
00:55:21,855 --> 00:55:22,367
Weezer

984
00:55:22,879 --> 00:55:27,743
But we should rightly probably something

985
00:55:27,999 --> 00:55:28,511
It is kind of weird

986
00:55:31,327 --> 00:55:32,351
What article was

987
00:55:32,607 --> 00:55:33,119
Is he

988
00:55:35,423 --> 00:55:36,447
Tatoosh your lawyer say

989
00:55:36,703 --> 00:55:37,983
That the founding fathers

990
00:55:40,543 --> 00:55:42,335
Song about conversation

991
00:55:42,591 --> 00:55:43,103
Somebody have a cough

992
00:55:43,615 --> 00:55:44,127
Original lawyers

993
00:55:44,383 --> 00:55:47,455
Oh okay I thought they came on the show

994
00:55:47,711 --> 00:55:48,991
Cuz he linked to an article

995
00:55:49,503 --> 00:55:50,015
I don't know

996
00:55:50,527 --> 00:55:51,039
I didn't look it up

997
00:55:51,551 --> 00:55:52,063
I don't know

998
00:55:52,575 --> 00:55:53,855
I don't believe it

999
00:55:54,367 --> 00:55:58,207
Everything way that I don't believe he's only made one prediction about financial collapse

1000
00:56:00,767 --> 00:56:03,071
Listen to this show there's so much that I have to say

1001
00:56:04,863 --> 00:56:06,399
And then just move along

1002
00:56:06,911 --> 00:56:07,423
My spot

1003
00:56:07,679 --> 00:56:08,447
Otherwise

1004
00:56:10,239 --> 00:56:12,031
Letsjerk

1005
00:56:12,287 --> 00:56:13,823
Will get really pissed off

1006
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:14,847
But

1007
00:56:15,103 --> 00:56:17,663
As long as the episode last

1008
00:56:18,431 --> 00:56:21,247
Recorded in real-time while I research

1009
00:56:21,759 --> 00:56:23,039
Better be a terrible show

1010
00:56:23,551 --> 00:56:25,087
And will not be what we do

1011
00:56:25,343 --> 00:56:29,951
Just a384 hour-long episode marathon

1012
00:56:31,999 --> 00:56:32,767
Larry Nichols

1013
00:56:33,279 --> 00:56:33,791
Says something

1014
00:56:34,047 --> 00:56:35,583
Also surprised me a little bit

1015
00:56:41,215 --> 00:56:43,007
Immediately

1016
00:56:43,263 --> 00:56:44,799
The couch

1017
00:56:51,455 --> 00:56:53,503
And remember I have

1018
00:56:57,343 --> 00:57:02,463
Well I just called a little problem

1019
00:57:07,327 --> 00:57:08,351
This is real

1020
00:57:08,607 --> 00:57:11,935
It's not

1021
00:57:12,191 --> 00:57:12,959
The grossest thing

1022
00:57:13,215 --> 00:57:13,727
King of

1023
00:57:16,287 --> 00:57:17,311
Anita Hill

1024
00:57:17,567 --> 00:57:20,895
Very obviously he was sexually harassed by Clarence

1025
00:57:21,151 --> 00:57:22,431
Thomas when she work for him

1026
00:57:22,687 --> 00:57:25,247
The right-wing attacks

1027
00:57:25,503 --> 00:57:26,783
Aggressively

1028
00:57:28,575 --> 00:57:29,855
Years later even

1029
00:57:30,111 --> 00:57:32,671
Clarence Thomas's wife left a voicemail for her

1030
00:57:33,183 --> 00:57:34,975
That was demanding an apology

1031
00:57:35,487 --> 00:57:38,559
She thought it was fake and called the FBI

1032
00:57:38,815 --> 00:57:42,399
Found out it was real and

1033
00:57:42,655 --> 00:57:44,191
Considers an olive branch

1034
00:57:44,447 --> 00:57:46,495
Okay

1035
00:57:46,751 --> 00:57:47,775
Alright

1036
00:57:48,031 --> 00:57:49,823
But you guys are crazy

1037
00:57:50,079 --> 00:57:50,591
You better go

1038
00:57:50,847 --> 00:57:51,615
You're my husband

1039
00:57:51,871 --> 00:57:52,895
Public apology

1040
00:57:55,711 --> 00:57:57,247
Olive

1041
00:57:57,503 --> 00:57:58,271
Trying to start

1042
00:57:58,527 --> 00:57:59,807
A dialogue

1043
00:58:00,063 --> 00:58:02,879
You always negotiate from a position of

1044
00:58:03,135 --> 00:58:05,951
Straight up murder ink

1045
00:58:06,463 --> 00:58:08,767
Looked into this in a long time

1046
00:58:09,279 --> 00:58:10,815
Clarence Thomas

1047
00:58:11,071 --> 00:58:11,583
Situation

1048
00:58:11,839 --> 00:58:12,351
Anita Hill

1049
00:58:12,607 --> 00:58:14,143
Was what caused David Brock

1050
00:58:14,655 --> 00:58:15,423
Become a liberal

1051
00:58:18,239 --> 00:58:19,263
There is so much

1052
00:58:20,543 --> 00:58:21,823
Backroom evil

1053
00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:23,615
Character assassination going on

1054
00:58:23,871 --> 00:58:24,639
This woman who is just

1055
00:58:25,151 --> 00:58:25,919
You know saying

1056
00:58:26,687 --> 00:58:27,711
Was sexually harassed

1057
00:58:27,967 --> 00:58:28,479
And she

1058
00:58:29,247 --> 00:58:32,831
Absolutely was

1059
00:58:33,087 --> 00:58:38,719
Who put this pube on my Coke

1060
00:58:39,231 --> 00:58:40,767
Also Larry Nicholson

1061
00:58:41,023 --> 00:58:44,095
I don't believe that he hung out with Clarence Thomas

1062
00:58:44,607 --> 00:58:47,679
In the same way I don't believe you was talkin to Bibi Netanyahu

1063
00:58:48,191 --> 00:58:49,727
I don't believe any of that s***

1064
00:58:49,983 --> 00:58:52,031
Also we talked over

1065
00:58:52,287 --> 00:58:53,055
But In that clip

1066
00:58:53,567 --> 00:58:56,127
What's the first time that Alex Jones gives up

1067
00:58:56,383 --> 00:58:58,175
Did Matt drudge was talking about Clarence Thomas

1068
00:58:58,687 --> 00:59:01,503
Because he's like Larry Nichols brings up Clarence Thomas

1069
00:59:01,759 --> 00:59:07,391
Alex like Talk Talk giveaway

1070
00:59:11,999 --> 00:59:13,535
Give them all up

1071
00:59:16,607 --> 00:59:17,119
Donald Trump

1072
00:59:20,959 --> 00:59:23,775
Start of the two sources if Donald Trump

1073
00:59:26,591 --> 00:59:30,431
So good the end of October

1074
00:59:30,687 --> 00:59:32,735
Still no development in terms of trump

1075
00:59:33,247 --> 00:59:36,575
Nothing just wait I forgot

1076
00:59:36,831 --> 00:59:38,623
We have something big we have to talk about

1077
00:59:38,879 --> 00:59:40,159
Nope nevermind

1078
00:59:40,415 --> 00:59:41,439
Bronchi

1079
00:59:41,695 --> 00:59:42,207
Ron

1080
00:59:42,463 --> 00:59:43,231
Alert alert

1081
00:59:46,559 --> 00:59:47,583
Don't look at me like that

1082
00:59:53,215 --> 00:59:54,495
October 9th

1083
00:59:54,751 --> 00:59:56,543
And there's only one clip to play but something

1084
00:59:56,799 --> 00:59:57,311
Nothing to discuss

1085
00:59:59,615 --> 01:00:01,663
It's another one

1086
01:00:01,919 --> 01:00:02,431
This one

1087
01:00:03,199 --> 01:00:04,735
Supposed to be Dracula

1088
01:00:04,991 --> 01:00:06,527
Peter Gunn

1089
01:00:07,039 --> 01:00:08,575
Two plus two equals five

1090
01:00:09,087 --> 01:00:09,599
Jojo

1091
01:00:09,855 --> 01:00:11,135
Question asked

1092
01:00:11,391 --> 01:00:12,671
Truly

1093
01:00:14,975 --> 01:00:16,767
Or Count Dracula

1094
01:00:19,583 --> 01:00:22,911
Have a strong will for one whose only live one life

1095
01:00:27,775 --> 01:00:29,823
There is nothing

1096
01:00:32,127 --> 01:00:34,175
There is no world government

1097
01:00:35,199 --> 01:00:40,575
Vehicle cameras

1098
01:00:41,087 --> 01:00:43,135
There is no

1099
01:00:43,647 --> 01:00:47,487
That are not 40 million illegals pouring into the United States

1100
01:00:49,535 --> 01:00:51,583
That's not on

1101
01:00:51,839 --> 01:00:52,607
To not

1102
01:00:53,119 --> 01:00:53,631
Do not

1103
01:00:54,143 --> 01:00:54,911
Awaken

1104
01:00:55,423 --> 01:00:56,191
Trust

1105
01:00:56,447 --> 01:00:57,215
Bosch

1106
01:00:57,983 --> 01:01:00,799
There is no organization in power

1107
01:01:01,311 --> 01:01:03,359
Power does not seek power

1108
01:01:07,199 --> 01:01:10,015
You are becoming sleepy my dear

1109
01:01:12,575 --> 01:01:15,135
Show me Annette

1110
01:01:15,391 --> 01:01:17,695
If you still talk about Van Helsing

1111
01:01:18,719 --> 01:01:20,767
Truly

1112
01:01:21,279 --> 01:01:22,047
Tympanic

1113
01:01:22,303 --> 01:01:24,863
Yeah that's what it is

1114
01:01:31,519 --> 01:01:35,615
Eclipse of these things cuz they they aren't worth it

1115
01:01:35,871 --> 01:01:38,431
He's there was a yoga class

1116
01:01:38,943 --> 01:01:39,967
Didn't allow white people in

1117
01:01:40,223 --> 01:01:40,735
I don't care

1118
01:01:42,271 --> 01:01:42,783
Just don't

1119
01:01:43,039 --> 01:01:44,575
I don't care at all

1120
01:01:45,855 --> 01:01:46,879
But

1121
01:01:47,391 --> 01:01:51,487
I don't have it

1122
01:01:52,255 --> 01:01:54,559
F*** I forgot to get the eclipse

1123
01:01:54,815 --> 01:01:55,327
Sucks

1124
01:01:55,583 --> 01:01:57,119
That sucks this one was big

1125
01:01:57,375 --> 01:01:58,655
He literally says

1126
01:01:58,911 --> 01:02:00,447
Winning executive fights checks

1127
01:02:00,703 --> 01:02:01,471
Imbalances

1128
01:02:01,727 --> 01:02:03,007
That is a dictatorship

1129
01:02:03,519 --> 01:02:05,567
I would love to throw that Clipper right in his face

1130
01:02:06,079 --> 01:02:06,591
Right about now

1131
01:02:08,127 --> 01:02:09,919
The big thing that's going on is

1132
01:02:11,199 --> 01:02:11,711
Obama

1133
01:02:13,503 --> 01:02:17,343
Pardon me

1134
01:02:17,599 --> 01:02:18,879
Confirm nor deny that it is

1135
01:02:19,135 --> 01:02:19,647
His middle name

1136
01:02:19,903 --> 01:02:20,671
Ipecac

1137
01:02:20,927 --> 01:02:22,975
Pajamas

1138
01:02:24,767 --> 01:02:26,559
Shooting in Oregon

1139
01:02:28,351 --> 01:02:29,119
Before that's a little bit

1140
01:02:29,375 --> 01:02:31,423
Before is going

1141
01:02:31,679 --> 01:02:32,447
To meet with

1142
01:02:32,959 --> 01:02:34,239
Families and going

1143
01:02:34,495 --> 01:02:35,775
To pay condolences

1144
01:02:36,031 --> 01:02:37,567
Whatever

1145
01:02:37,823 --> 01:02:39,871
Like a good present

1146
01:02:40,127 --> 01:02:41,151
Something

1147
01:02:41,407 --> 01:02:42,431
President Taft

1148
01:02:43,199 --> 01:02:45,759
You know if you were a good president

1149
01:02:46,015 --> 01:02:47,807
You would want to be a symbol to the nation

1150
01:02:48,063 --> 01:02:48,831
Even if you're not nest

1151
01:02:49,087 --> 01:02:54,207
Sara Lee running everything like a dictator you are still a symbol of the American conscience

1152
01:02:54,463 --> 01:02:54,975
And the America

1153
01:02:55,231 --> 01:02:55,743
Spirit

1154
01:02:55,999 --> 01:02:58,559
And so if there is

1155
01:02:58,815 --> 01:02:59,839
Yes you should be there

1156
01:03:00,095 --> 01:03:02,399
To make sure that everyone is together

1157
01:03:02,655 --> 01:03:03,679
Everyone realizes

1158
01:03:03,935 --> 01:03:05,983
What's going on in everybody decides

1159
01:03:06,239 --> 01:03:08,031
Time to f****** fix it

1160
01:03:08,543 --> 01:03:09,055
Or

1161
01:03:09,311 --> 01:03:13,663
You could go on TV three days later

1162
01:03:13,919 --> 01:03:20,063
102 102 102

1163
01:03:22,623 --> 01:03:24,671
That's good.

1164
01:03:24,927 --> 01:03:28,511
There's good and bad

1165
01:03:33,119 --> 01:03:35,423
Amazing

1166
01:03:35,935 --> 01:03:37,471
Is only even what like

1167
01:03:38,751 --> 01:03:39,775
Really pissed off

1168
01:03:40,031 --> 01:03:40,543
How much

1169
01:03:42,079 --> 01:03:43,359
Murder he was doing

1170
01:03:43,615 --> 01:03:48,991
I was really mad if I just don't want us to bring it

1171
01:03:49,759 --> 01:03:51,807
Sure bring back Obama's

1172
01:03:52,319 --> 01:03:58,207
Because Trump is so much worse so much worse on the murder run

1173
01:03:58,463 --> 01:03:59,231
Literally ever

1174
01:03:59,487 --> 01:04:00,767
Refract 100%

1175
01:04:01,023 --> 01:04:03,327
The front totally there is no there is

1176
01:04:03,583 --> 01:04:04,863
0 upside down

1177
01:04:05,119 --> 01:04:06,911
To Trump being president unless you're really rich

1178
01:04:07,167 --> 01:04:11,263
Shouldn't theoretical tax breaks accounting

1179
01:04:11,519 --> 01:04:13,055
There is no upside

1180
01:04:13,567 --> 01:04:15,871
Well I suppose if you're an oil exact you do get

1181
01:04:16,127 --> 01:04:17,151
National Park

1182
01:04:19,455 --> 01:04:22,271
So whatever

1183
01:04:22,527 --> 01:04:27,391
F*** it is you want now you calm down and have a cigarette calm down I just

1184
01:04:27,647 --> 01:04:33,791
We just heard Obama's voice and it triggers me is like when all we had to work

1185
01:04:34,047 --> 01:04:36,607
Sorry about I got triggered and I'm sorry

1186
01:04:36,863 --> 01:04:38,655
I'm sorry

1187
01:04:42,239 --> 01:04:44,287
Paul Joseph Watson

1188
01:04:44,543 --> 01:04:46,079
We're not listening

1189
01:04:46,335 --> 01:04:52,479
Have a nice little chat and I realize that the two of you not like each other

1190
01:04:52,991 --> 01:04:56,319
They seem to be miserable being in the same room

1191
01:04:56,831 --> 01:04:58,879
He is not like any of Alex's jokes

1192
01:04:59,135 --> 01:05:00,415
He is just little looking like

1193
01:05:01,183 --> 01:05:01,695
This guy

1194
01:05:02,207 --> 01:05:02,975
Which

1195
01:05:03,231 --> 01:05:05,023
I kind of agree

1196
01:05:05,535 --> 01:05:06,047
They

1197
01:05:06,303 --> 01:05:07,583
Presented as

1198
01:05:07,839 --> 01:05:11,167
Obama is going to Oregon to feed off the desk

1199
01:05:11,679 --> 01:05:13,727
To go feed off The Souls of the Dead

1200
01:05:15,519 --> 01:05:17,055
But here's the thing

1201
01:05:17,823 --> 01:05:19,359
If you really think about it there's no

1202
01:05:19,615 --> 01:05:21,151
Nothing Obama could do that would

1203
01:05:21,663 --> 01:05:22,943
When in the situation

1204
01:05:23,199 --> 01:05:28,831
Cuz if he goes they're going to use the argument you just use

1205
01:05:29,087 --> 01:05:31,135
Why wouldn't he the president how could he

1206
01:05:31,391 --> 01:05:32,415
How could you be so heartless

1207
01:05:32,671 --> 01:05:33,951
Does not show up at the shooting

1208
01:05:34,207 --> 01:05:40,351
What weather the victim not black enough or something like that

1209
01:05:41,631 --> 01:05:42,911
If you hate somebody that much

1210
01:05:43,423 --> 01:05:45,471
There's no there's never going

1211
01:05:46,239 --> 01:05:49,311
Nobody propaganda trap

1212
01:05:49,567 --> 01:05:52,895
The only thing to do in that situation is ignore it and I'm glad that most

1213
01:05:53,151 --> 01:05:53,663
People do

1214
01:05:53,919 --> 01:05:54,431
But

1215
01:05:55,199 --> 01:05:55,967
Alex Jones

1216
01:05:56,223 --> 01:05:56,735
Send

1217
01:05:56,991 --> 01:05:57,759
Jakari Jackson

1218
01:05:59,039 --> 01:05:59,807
To Oregon

1219
01:06:00,575 --> 01:06:02,111
And the wrapping it up

1220
01:06:02,367 --> 01:06:03,903
As like there's going to be a protest

1221
01:06:04,159 --> 01:06:06,207
The Obama you're not welcome here

1222
01:06:06,719 --> 01:06:07,743
Stop trying to

1223
01:06:07,999 --> 01:06:08,767
Split these deaths

1224
01:06:10,047 --> 01:06:12,095
You think there's going to be 10,000 people there

1225
01:06:12,607 --> 01:06:15,423
Which is based on a Facebook event

1226
01:06:15,935 --> 01:06:16,959
So good reporting

1227
01:06:17,215 --> 01:06:20,287
Turns out there's more like a couple hundred

1228
01:06:20,543 --> 01:06:21,567
And they're at

1229
01:06:21,823 --> 01:06:22,335
A place that

1230
01:06:22,591 --> 01:06:23,103
They think

1231
01:06:23,359 --> 01:06:24,639
Obama is going to land at

1232
01:06:25,151 --> 01:06:25,919
They don't know

1233
01:06:26,431 --> 01:06:27,967
He doesn't end up liking there

1234
01:06:28,223 --> 01:06:32,831
Add it's just walking around

1235
01:06:33,087 --> 01:06:35,647
Good deal

1236
01:06:35,903 --> 01:06:42,047
Like a microphone and another one is a young guy with a Halo

1237
01:06:42,303 --> 01:06:43,071
Prism shirt

1238
01:06:44,351 --> 01:06:45,375
They're all from out of

1239
01:06:46,143 --> 01:06:47,423
They all came in

1240
01:06:47,679 --> 01:06:49,727
To say Obama you're not welcome in this town

1241
01:06:50,495 --> 01:06:51,775
It's very weird to me

1242
01:06:52,287 --> 01:06:54,335
It's very strange that you have these people

1243
01:06:54,847 --> 01:06:57,407
Speaking for that town because of their hatred of Obama

1244
01:06:58,175 --> 01:07:00,479
Anyway it's terrible the audios bad and

1245
01:07:00,735 --> 01:07:01,759
There's not much

1246
01:07:02,015 --> 01:07:03,039
Not much going on with it

1247
01:07:03,295 --> 01:07:03,807
But it does

1248
01:07:05,343 --> 01:07:05,855
Because of

1249
01:07:06,111 --> 01:07:08,159
Damned-if-you-do damned-if-you-don't

1250
01:07:08,415 --> 01:07:09,695
Playset Obama into

1251
01:07:09,951 --> 01:07:11,743
And the fact they spent money to fly

1252
01:07:11,999 --> 01:07:13,279
Can bigs into carry out there

1253
01:07:13,535 --> 01:07:14,047
For nothing

1254
01:07:15,071 --> 01:07:18,143
Except

1255
01:07:18,399 --> 01:07:21,727
Or ride the rails

1256
01:07:21,983 --> 01:07:22,751
Like

1257
01:07:27,103 --> 01:07:29,151
So also

1258
01:07:29,407 --> 01:07:33,503
Also

1259
01:07:35,551 --> 01:07:37,343
Very aggressively

1260
01:07:37,599 --> 01:07:39,647
And I saved you

1261
01:07:39,903 --> 01:07:41,439
Bears mentioning

1262
01:07:41,695 --> 01:07:42,463
Because those dudes suck

1263
01:07:42,975 --> 01:07:43,743
So

1264
01:07:43,999 --> 01:07:44,767
That's the end of the night

1265
01:07:46,559 --> 01:07:47,583
No show on Saturday

1266
01:07:48,095 --> 01:07:49,119
And we get October

1267
01:07:49,631 --> 01:07:51,935
Which is the the last day we're going to be covering

1268
01:07:52,447 --> 01:07:54,239
This is going way too fast

1269
01:07:55,519 --> 01:07:57,311
I don't know what's going on we're only an hour

1270
01:07:59,103 --> 01:07:59,615
I feel like

1271
01:07:59,871 --> 01:08:00,383
It's been more

1272
01:08:00,639 --> 01:08:01,919
Yeah this is weird

1273
01:08:02,175 --> 01:08:02,687
We have covered

1274
01:08:02,943 --> 01:08:04,479
A lot

1275
01:08:04,735 --> 01:08:07,039
I don't know I feel like we've been digging around

1276
01:08:07,551 --> 01:08:10,367
I feel like what is going on how many Clips do you have

1277
01:08:10,879 --> 01:08:12,159
We're World lipstick

1278
01:08:12,415 --> 01:08:17,279
How are we on this man eclipse this fast

1279
01:08:17,535 --> 01:08:18,047
Bananas

1280
01:08:18,559 --> 01:08:19,327
Something is wrong

1281
01:08:21,631 --> 01:08:22,143
Nothing wrong

1282
01:08:22,655 --> 01:08:24,191
No it is I just checked the time

1283
01:08:25,983 --> 01:08:27,007
Feel like we're in a wormhole

1284
01:08:27,263 --> 01:08:28,543
Clips

1285
01:08:28,799 --> 01:08:29,311
Last

1286
01:08:29,823 --> 01:08:30,335
I guess

1287
01:08:31,103 --> 01:08:31,615
Vamp

1288
01:08:32,639 --> 01:08:33,407
So

1289
01:08:38,783 --> 01:08:40,063
I don't know what he's doing here

1290
01:08:40,575 --> 01:08:41,087
I'll be honest

1291
01:08:41,855 --> 01:08:43,391
T-shirt with the agenda

1292
01:08:43,903 --> 01:08:45,951
But he says something that I do not agree with

1293
01:08:46,207 --> 01:08:46,975
About a celebrity

1294
01:08:47,231 --> 01:08:53,375
Also see if you can guess who the celebrity is before he says his name

1295
01:08:53,631 --> 01:08:54,655
La

1296
01:08:56,191 --> 01:08:57,215

1297
01:08:59,263 --> 01:09:00,031
Mario Lopez

1298
01:09:00,287 --> 01:09:02,847
California

1299
01:09:03,615 --> 01:09:05,407
But the illegals can create

1300
01:09:06,687 --> 01:09:08,991
Just huge amounts of crimes

1301
01:09:09,247 --> 01:09:09,759
So hold on

1302
01:09:10,527 --> 01:09:11,039
Roman Polanski

1303
01:09:11,295 --> 01:09:11,807

01:10:01,983 --> 01:10:07,615
But I know the inside of Holly Road and I know I've been told the exact same thing with some of the biggest stars out there

1342
01:11:25,183 --> 01:11:25,695
And then

1343
01:11:27,231 --> 01:11:27,999
Then they were squatting

1344
01:11:34,399 --> 01:11:34,911
Signature

1345
01:11:35,167 --> 01:11:40,031
Warrants for their arrest issued Court

1346
01:11:42,079 --> 01:11:44,127
Where are they were arrested for

1347
01:11:44,639 --> 01:11:47,967
Under the immigration and refugee

1348
01:11:49,503 --> 01:11:50,783
Claiming that they fear for their lives

1349
01:11:51,039 --> 01:11:54,111
Because of these starkiller's

1350
01:11:54,367 --> 01:11:54,879
Stuck around

1351
01:11:58,975 --> 01:11:59,999
For permanent resident status

1352
01:12:02,303 --> 01:12:05,631
You know you lived in Montreal but was briefly arrested for not checking

1353
01:12:05,887 --> 01:12:06,655
Non-resident

1354
01:12:06,911 --> 01:12:09,471
Court of Canada and America

1355
01:12:09,727 --> 01:12:11,263
He's an illegal immigrant

1356
01:12:11,775 --> 01:12:17,919
Vermont

1357
01:12:20,735 --> 01:12:21,503
Origin

1358
01:12:22,783 --> 01:12:24,575
You can get through customs without them noticing

1359
01:12:27,391 --> 01:12:27,903
1

1360
01:12:28,415 --> 01:12:29,183
Again

1361
01:12:29,439 --> 01:12:29,951
Love doing it.

1362
01:12:31,487 --> 01:12:35,327
Is very real

1363
01:12:36,351 --> 01:12:37,119
100%

1364
01:12:38,655 --> 01:12:40,191
I am going to have to arrest you you f******

1365
01:12:40,703 --> 01:12:46,079
A few days later after he was detained by US Customs was released and allowed to remain

1366
01:12:46,591 --> 01:12:48,127
Though he is still subject to arrest

1367
01:12:48,383 --> 01:12:49,663
Should you travel to another state

1368
01:12:55,551 --> 01:12:57,343
Billy Burke

1369
01:12:57,599 --> 01:12:58,623
Bernie Sanders

1370
01:12:58,879 --> 01:13:00,927
Black mouth shut up that's what I would guess

1371
01:13:01,183 --> 01:13:01,951
Bernie Sanders

1372
01:13:02,463 --> 01:13:07,327
I know it's the stock killers that coming out tomato

1373
01:13:09,631 --> 01:13:10,911
Seems credible vote

1374
01:13:12,191 --> 01:13:15,775
Which is right in line with Alex Jones is picking cuz look at all the

1375
01:13:19,615 --> 01:13:21,151
Prediction

1376
01:13:21,407 --> 01:13:21,919
To the loudest

1377
01:13:22,431 --> 01:13:24,479
It said on his show already

1378
01:13:26,783 --> 01:13:28,831
B e d

1379
01:13:29,087 --> 01:13:29,599
Harry dent

1380
01:13:29,855 --> 01:13:30,367
Himself

1381
01:13:30,879 --> 01:13:32,159
Larry nickel

1382
01:13:33,439 --> 01:13:35,231
Now we get to add one more to that list

1383
01:13:35,487 --> 01:13:37,023
A Leo zagami

1384
01:13:37,279 --> 01:13:43,423
Leo zagami

1385
01:13:43,679 --> 01:13:45,983
There's a gay Lobby in the Vatican

1386
01:13:46,239 --> 01:13:50,335
I got all that stuff cuz I don't really care and it's terrible

1387
01:13:50,591 --> 01:13:51,359
In the clutch

1388
01:13:51,615 --> 01:13:52,639
With a s*** prediction

1389
01:13:53,151 --> 01:13:56,991
How is it going is it going

1390
01:13:57,247 --> 01:13:58,783
What's the next big shoe drop

1391
01:13:59,295 --> 01:14:02,879
I'm getting award Awards

1392
01:14:09,535 --> 01:14:10,047
Why

1393
01:14:10,303 --> 01:14:14,399
Okay that's because two years ago the Scandal started five years ago

1394
01:14:14,655 --> 01:14:18,751
Jesse's going to

1395
01:14:38,463 --> 01:14:44,607
Staind

1396
01:14:48,447 --> 01:14:54,591
He's coming

1397
01:14:54,847 --> 01:14:57,407
Norfolk

1398
01:15:00,223 --> 01:15:01,503
So that's pretty

1399
01:15:03,551 --> 01:15:04,063
Isn't that

1400
01:15:05,087 --> 01:15:06,623
If I recall it was

1401
01:15:06,879 --> 01:15:08,415
Bananas

1402
01:15:14,559 --> 01:15:15,839
Who resigned

1403
01:15:17,631 --> 01:15:18,143
Wackadoo

1404
01:15:18,399 --> 01:15:20,959
Premise

1405
01:15:21,215 --> 01:15:23,775
Flushes out as the clip goes on is that

1406
01:15:24,287 --> 01:15:25,823
These

1407
01:15:26,079 --> 01:15:29,407
The pope into a position as opposed to like a lifelong

1408
01:15:29,663 --> 01:15:30,175
Okay

1409
01:15:30,431 --> 01:15:33,247
Can shuttle people in and out there will be multiple living popes

1410
01:15:33,503 --> 01:15:35,295
Eventually they'll be a council of Pope

1411
01:15:35,551 --> 01:15:37,087
You know that's actually a really

1412
01:15:37,855 --> 01:15:38,879
Time in the

1413
01:15:40,415 --> 01:15:41,183
The Pope's fighting

1414
01:15:43,743 --> 01:15:45,535
That's just one of those beautiful things were like

1415
01:15:45,791 --> 01:15:47,327
You guys know that your religion

1416
01:15:49,119 --> 01:15:50,143
Thinking about you guys

1417
01:15:50,399 --> 01:15:52,191
Seemed really silly to all of us

1418
01:15:52,447 --> 01:15:55,775
Bulshit out of the gate

1419
01:15:57,055 --> 01:15:58,847
There's a black pope

1420
01:16:01,407 --> 01:16:04,735
Multiple popes

1421
01:16:05,247 --> 01:16:11,391
Well he saw that movie with the order

1422
01:16:14,719 --> 01:16:15,231
I love that movie

1423
01:16:15,743 --> 01:16:21,375
I kind of agree it was like a secret

1424
01:16:21,631 --> 01:16:22,143
Sossaman

1425
01:16:22,399 --> 01:16:24,191
Shannyn Sossamon she's the one man to man

1426
01:16:24,703 --> 01:16:25,215
She's the one

1427
01:16:25,471 --> 01:16:31,359
Accepting that 40 days and 40 nights when are mad that makes her orgasm with

1428
01:16:31,615 --> 01:16:34,687
Look up rose petal

1429
01:16:36,991 --> 01:16:39,551
Hollywood Homicide Hamilton

1430
01:16:40,063 --> 01:16:41,855
Harrison Ford

1431
01:16:44,415 --> 01:16:45,695
No idea

1432
01:16:45,951 --> 01:16:47,231
Noise

1433
01:16:47,487 --> 01:16:50,303
I lost track of Josh Hartnett around the

1434
01:16:51,583 --> 01:16:53,375
He was in Penny Dreadful

1435
01:16:54,143 --> 01:16:54,911
Very thrilled for

1436
01:16:55,167 --> 01:16:56,703
It wasn't it was

1437
01:16:59,007 --> 01:16:59,519
Stockman

1438
01:17:00,799 --> 01:17:01,567
What's

1439
01:17:01,823 --> 01:17:02,847
God damn it I don't remember

1440
01:17:08,223 --> 01:17:08,991
This whole investigation

1441
01:17:09,759 --> 01:17:11,551
August 2015 investigation

1442
01:17:12,063 --> 01:17:12,575
Is

1443
01:17:13,343 --> 01:17:16,671
Figure out where Alex Jones decided Trump

1444
01:17:16,927 --> 01:17:17,439
Is cool

1445
01:17:17,951 --> 01:17:20,767
For the time those covered he's not really talk too much about you

1446
01:17:22,047 --> 01:17:22,559
How many months

1447
01:17:23,071 --> 01:17:26,143
Close to 5 months

1448
01:17:26,399 --> 01:17:27,679
Started in June

1449
01:17:27,935 --> 01:17:29,215
Close

1450
01:17:29,471 --> 01:17:33,823
He doesn't really talk about Trump

1451
01:17:35,103 --> 01:17:37,663
Choosing stuff on the 11th

1452
01:17:37,919 --> 01:17:40,223
Is there like a larger context

1453
01:17:40,479 --> 01:17:41,759
Because if I call

1454
01:17:42,271 --> 01:17:48,415
This insulated what's going on in the world

1455
01:17:48,671 --> 01:17:50,463
Every single day

1456
01:17:50,719 --> 01:17:53,279
Everyone's talking about Trump Ad nauseam

1457
01:17:55,583 --> 01:17:56,863
Being weirdly restrain

1458
01:18:01,727 --> 01:18:04,031
Billions and billions of dollars in free

1459
01:18:04,287 --> 01:18:07,615
Because everybody was just like

1460
01:18:08,895 --> 01:18:09,407
He's in Albany

1461
01:18:09,663 --> 01:18:14,527
We'll look at this silly dumb f*** nominee thank God we got him so our other most hated candidate

1462
01:18:15,295 --> 01:18:16,319
Will finally become

1463
01:18:16,575 --> 01:18:17,087
Can president

1464
01:18:17,343 --> 01:18:17,855
Nope

1465
01:18:18,111 --> 01:18:18,623
Nope

1466
01:18:18,879 --> 01:18:21,951
Because of the complexity of your dumb f*** media

1467
01:18:25,279 --> 01:18:31,423
Times we've been over that I'm glad I'm glad MSNBC

1468
01:18:31,679 --> 01:18:33,727
The greatest

1469
01:18:33,983 --> 01:18:40,127
Conservative columnist of our time

1470
01:18:41,151 --> 01:18:44,223
I don't know

1471
01:18:44,991 --> 01:18:51,135
Then we live in a weird funhouse mirror of the world

1472
01:18:51,391 --> 01:18:56,255
That must be what's going on

1473
01:18:57,535 --> 01:18:59,583
Like this

1474
01:18:59,839 --> 01:19:00,607
That they're actually sick

1475
01:19:00,863 --> 01:19:01,631
Successfully doing

1476
01:19:01,887 --> 01:19:03,935
Is absolutely destroying the Earth

1477
01:19:04,703 --> 01:19:08,287
Like this like they're getting rid of all the regulation

1478
01:19:08,799 --> 01:19:10,591
They're getting ready to sell off our Nash

1479
01:19:10,847 --> 01:19:14,943
They're getting rid of all of these like the EPA is even allowed

1480
01:19:15,199 --> 01:19:15,711
To use the word

1481
01:19:15,967 --> 01:19:16,991
Climate change anymore

1482
01:19:17,247 --> 01:19:18,271
Like they're killing

1483
01:19:18,783 --> 01:19:21,343
Yeah but all of the failing at

1484
01:19:23,135 --> 01:19:23,903
Expect

1485
01:19:24,159 --> 01:19:24,927
Tacular Lee

1486
01:19:26,463 --> 01:19:27,999
You're just like well maybe we can

1487
01:19:28,255 --> 01:19:29,023
Can get through this

1488
01:19:29,535 --> 01:19:30,559
Like maybe we can

1489
01:19:30,815 --> 01:19:32,607
Maybe we actually can get through this

1490
01:19:33,119 --> 01:19:37,727
Trump should be

1491
01:19:37,983 --> 01:19:39,263
The

1492
01:19:39,519 --> 01:19:41,055
Absolutely

1493
01:19:44,895 --> 01:19:47,455
Just like football gear

1494
01:19:49,759 --> 01:19:51,551
You're not going to repeal that

1495
01:19:51,807 --> 01:19:52,319
It's just

1496
01:19:52,575 --> 01:19:54,111
It's too big

1497
01:19:54,367 --> 01:19:55,135
Actually

1498
01:19:55,647 --> 01:19:58,719
Yeah it's helped so many

1499
01:19:58,975 --> 01:19:59,487
Funny people

1500
01:19:59,743 --> 01:20:00,255
That you're not going to

1501
01:20:00,511 --> 01:20:04,863
Take it back the same thing is true of a lot of these regulations

1502
01:20:05,119 --> 01:20:05,631
And it's not going

1503
01:20:05,887 --> 01:20:06,911
Like our next

1504
01:20:07,423 --> 01:20:08,703
Just going to go and they're back on

1505
01:20:12,031 --> 01:20:17,408
He took a lot of them took years in the first place

1506
01:20:17,920 --> 01:20:18,944
Cruiser so strongly against

1507
01:20:19,200 --> 01:20:21,248
Even though they save lives

1508
01:20:21,504 --> 01:20:25,856
Protect the environment and s*** like that.

1509
01:20:26,624 --> 01:20:27,648
Businesses to work in

1510
01:20:29,440 --> 01:20:30,208
Who's going to save people

1511
01:20:30,464 --> 01:20:31,744
From their greedy selves

1512
01:20:34,304 --> 01:20:34,816
Clean water

1513
01:20:35,072 --> 01:20:38,400
EPA

1514
01:20:41,472 --> 01:20:42,752
Understand

1515
01:20:43,776 --> 01:20:44,288
Be just

1516
01:20:44,544 --> 01:20:46,336
Sincere level of sociopathy

1517
01:20:46,848 --> 01:20:48,128
And the worst part is

1518
01:20:48,640 --> 01:20:51,968
I can't understand how it is we don't have the ability to focus

1519
01:20:52,224 --> 01:20:52,736
Just long enough to

1520
01:20:53,248 --> 01:20:54,272
We all know Flint

1521
01:20:57,344 --> 01:20:58,112
We've all known this

1522
01:20:58,624 --> 01:20:59,392
For forever

1523
01:21:01,952 --> 01:21:02,464
Huge

1524
01:21:03,744 --> 01:21:04,256
To do something

1525
01:21:04,512 --> 01:21:05,536
That the internet

1526
01:21:05,792 --> 01:21:06,816
Focus for a f******

1527
01:21:07,072 --> 01:21:13,216
Internet focus for a week

1528
01:21:14,240 --> 01:21:15,776
To fix like the pipe in

1529
01:21:16,032 --> 01:21:16,544
Infrastructure

1530
01:21:17,568 --> 01:21:18,336
Couple billion dollars

1531
01:21:19,872 --> 01:21:22,944
Probably more like 500

1532
01:21:25,760 --> 01:21:28,064
He has a billion

1533
01:21:28,320 --> 01:21:30,112
Five bucks

1534
01:21:30,624 --> 01:21:32,160
Fix-It I mean

1535
01:21:32,416 --> 01:21:32,928
Put

1536
01:21:33,184 --> 01:21:37,536
I think that's overly simplistic but all of them

1537
01:21:38,048 --> 01:21:41,120
All of these GoFundMe for surgeries and all

1538
01:21:48,544 --> 01:21:50,592
Whispers

1539
01:21:50,848 --> 01:21:52,384
You bet your ass that's what we do

1540
01:21:54,432 --> 01:21:54,944
But it's

1541
01:21:55,968 --> 01:21:56,992
It's wrong to do that

1542
01:21:57,504 --> 01:21:58,272
It really is

1543
01:21:58,528 --> 01:22:03,392
Free market

1544
01:22:03,648 --> 01:22:06,464
Donated

1545
01:22:06,720 --> 01:22:09,024
So much money to the Chicago

1546
01:22:09,280 --> 01:22:10,304
To the Chicago Publix

1547
01:22:11,072 --> 01:22:12,096
It was amazing

1548
01:22:12,608 --> 01:22:13,376
Unfortunately

1549
01:22:13,632 --> 01:22:14,144
That's just

1550
01:22:14,400 --> 01:22:16,448
Wait for them to be like

1551
01:22:16,704 --> 01:22:17,472
It's all about

1552
01:22:20,288 --> 01:22:23,104
One argument but the other argument is

1553
01:22:23,360 --> 01:22:26,944
You can't you can't rely on these lofty principles of

1554
01:22:27,200 --> 01:22:30,016
Care of these things

1555
01:22:30,784 --> 01:22:34,624
Hey so if there is the possibility

1556
01:22:35,136 --> 01:22:35,648
Schools

1557
01:22:35,904 --> 01:22:36,416
Is it emergent

1558
01:22:37,952 --> 01:22:40,512
The right thing to do if you have the resources to do it

1559
01:22:40,768 --> 01:22:41,536
I agree so

1560
01:22:45,120 --> 01:22:48,448
All those things would be taking care of it a perfect world because they're not

1561
01:22:48,704 --> 01:22:49,472
Sometimes

1562
01:22:50,752 --> 01:22:51,264
Need to be a perv

1563
01:22:51,520 --> 01:22:52,032
Forgeworld to have

1564
01:22:52,288 --> 01:22:53,056
Functioning

1565
01:22:58,688 --> 01:23:01,248
Expression

1566
01:23:04,064 --> 01:23:06,368
But the whole point the whole point of us

1567
01:23:06,624 --> 01:23:08,416
Susan so we can go to school

1568
01:23:08,672 --> 01:23:09,696
So we have wrote

1569
01:23:09,952 --> 01:23:11,488
Don't even have a

1570
01:23:11,744 --> 01:23:12,256
Auctioning

1571
01:23:12,512 --> 01:23:14,560
System

1572
01:23:15,328 --> 01:23:15,840
Do any of the

1573
01:23:18,656 --> 01:23:19,168
What's

1574
01:23:19,936 --> 01:23:21,472
I don't know all I'm saying is

1575
01:23:21,728 --> 01:23:22,240
Is Texas

1576
01:23:22,752 --> 01:23:25,568
From the Union

1577
01:23:25,824 --> 01:23:26,592
Extorted

1578
01:23:26,848 --> 01:23:28,128
But you don't

1579
01:23:32,480 --> 01:23:33,504
The feed and then we're like

1580
01:23:33,760 --> 01:23:36,576
All right come on

1581
01:23:36,832 --> 01:23:37,344
I guess

1582
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:38,368
So

1583
01:23:38,624 --> 01:23:39,136
The founding fathers

1584
01:23:44,000 --> 01:23:45,024
Kieron the Oggy

1585
01:23:45,536 --> 01:23:46,816
August October 11th

1586
01:23:49,888 --> 01:23:51,424
Only inasmuch as

1587
01:23:51,680 --> 01:23:52,448
It's not surprising at all

1588
01:23:56,288 --> 01:23:58,848
When you look at all like the same person wrote it

1589
01:24:00,896 --> 01:24:04,224
Donald Trump

1590
01:24:08,576 --> 01:24:11,904
Colin Ford

1591
01:24:14,208 --> 01:24:17,280
As if Donald Trump worth 5 billion dollars

1592
01:24:17,792 --> 01:24:19,840
Drug cartels

1593
01:24:22,400 --> 01:24:23,424
I hope so remember that

1594
01:24:31,616 --> 01:24:33,920
And then they act like that's weird

1595
01:24:34,176 --> 01:24:36,480
Mother father

1596
01:24:39,040 --> 01:24:40,576
Mishawaka schools

1597
01:24:40,832 --> 01:24:41,344
Nobody

1598
01:25:20,512 --> 01:25:21,280
So you

1599
01:25:21,536 --> 01:25:22,816
I found out the Trump have a gun

1600
01:25:27,680 --> 01:25:28,960
He won't have a secret service

1601
01:25:29,216 --> 01:25:31,264
I don't know actually

1602
01:25:31,520 --> 01:25:32,544
I'm glad you brought that up

1603
01:25:32,800 --> 01:25:33,568
Cuz I think these

1604
01:25:33,824 --> 01:25:34,336
Scarier

1605
01:25:34,592 --> 01:25:35,872
Probably going to happen

1606
01:25:36,128 --> 01:25:36,640
When is malicious

1607
01:25:37,408 --> 01:25:40,736
I bet you are going to replace the Secret Service

1608
01:25:40,992 --> 01:25:45,088
Protecting

1609
01:25:45,344 --> 01:25:48,928
If I were watching a TV show and the development

1610
01:25:49,440 --> 01:25:52,000
Crazy right-wing nut ball president

1611
01:25:52,256 --> 01:25:55,072
Isn't power he loves the militia is he

1612
01:25:55,328 --> 01:25:58,656
He keeps saying positive things about them when he shouldn't be

1613
01:25:59,936 --> 01:26:01,216
Next episode

1614
01:26:01,472 --> 01:26:01,984
The Secret Service

1615
01:26:02,240 --> 01:26:04,544
Can't protect them anymore cuz they run out of money

1616
01:26:05,056 --> 01:26:07,104
I'm going to guess that episode end

1617
01:26:07,616 --> 01:26:09,920
On a dark note where the militia step-in

1618
01:26:10,176 --> 01:26:12,224
I like will do it for free cuz we're keeping the oath

1619
01:26:12,480 --> 01:26:13,248
Alright

1620
01:26:13,504 --> 01:26:14,016
Terrible

1621
01:26:14,272 --> 01:26:14,784
Prediction

1622
01:26:15,040 --> 01:26:17,856
Bethany Alex Jones Leo zagami level four

1623
01:26:18,112 --> 01:26:24,256
I'm not predicting it I'm just saying the appropriate for our world is becoming a

1624
01:26:24,512 --> 01:26:26,048
Dystopian fiction

1625
01:26:28,096 --> 01:26:31,168
Ridiculous

1626
01:26:31,424 --> 01:26:32,192
That would be so

1627
01:26:32,704 --> 01:26:33,216
Like

1628
01:26:33,472 --> 01:26:34,752
You wouldn't help but laugh

1629
01:26:35,264 --> 01:26:37,312
Like it's a tragedy

1630
01:26:37,568 --> 01:26:40,384
This is a tragedy that that could happen but at the same time

1631
01:26:40,896 --> 01:26:43,456
Really you're going to get a bunch of

1632
01:26:43,712 --> 01:26:44,224
Weekend

1633
01:26:44,480 --> 01:26:46,784
Paintball players to follow you around

1634
01:26:47,040 --> 01:26:49,344
I think you're under selling some of these a militia types

1635
01:26:50,880 --> 01:26:52,160
You need to look into these

1636
01:26:52,416 --> 01:26:53,184
Little bit

1637
01:26:55,488 --> 01:26:57,024
People in that World War

1638
01:26:58,304 --> 01:27:04,448
Credit for car

1639
01:27:05,984 --> 01:27:07,264
There are

1640
01:27:08,800 --> 01:27:09,568
Weekday

1641
01:27:10,592 --> 01:27:11,616
Rifle

1642
01:27:12,128 --> 01:27:13,920
I don't know how to put it.

1643
01:27:16,480 --> 01:27:18,016
Don't know what's going to happen

1644
01:27:19,552 --> 01:27:20,320
Alex Jones

1645
01:27:20,832 --> 01:27:21,344
Love gun

1646
01:27:22,112 --> 01:27:23,136
Love answer you would think

1647
01:27:23,648 --> 01:27:24,160
Maybe

1648
01:27:24,672 --> 01:27:26,720
Finding out the Donald Trump has a gun

1649
01:27:27,232 --> 01:27:28,768
Is going to be what pushes him over

1650
01:27:29,280 --> 01:27:30,304
You know what that actually does

1651
01:27:30,816 --> 01:27:32,608
Alex Jones love guns so much

1652
01:27:32,864 --> 01:27:35,680
He says everything irrational in the world in defense of God

1653
01:27:36,192 --> 01:27:36,960
It would make

1654
01:27:37,216 --> 01:27:37,728
$0.06

1655
01:27:37,984 --> 01:27:39,264
That this is the

1656
01:27:39,520 --> 01:27:40,032
The turning point

1657
01:27:41,568 --> 01:27:43,104
To the point where he had himself

1658
01:27:43,360 --> 01:27:44,384
Love the sky

1659
01:27:44,640 --> 01:27:45,920
What's interesting is

1660
01:27:47,968 --> 01:27:48,736
At the very end

1661
01:27:48,992 --> 01:27:51,296
Where he is talking about the media coverage of the head

1662
01:27:52,064 --> 01:27:53,344
And I remember

1663
01:27:53,600 --> 01:27:55,904
Does breathless where it's like

1664
01:28:12,800 --> 01:28:13,824
Reminder shouldn't be a prison

1665
01:28:14,080 --> 01:28:14,848
I think it's

1666
01:28:15,104 --> 01:28:16,896
Our responsibility to give it up for him

1667
01:28:17,152 --> 01:28:23,296
Absolute from a different perspective

1668
01:28:24,320 --> 01:28:29,952
Signed up with Donald Trump

1669
01:28:32,256 --> 01:28:33,280
I will just

1670
01:28:33,536 --> 01:28:34,048
The fact that your ass

1671
01:28:34,304 --> 01:28:34,816
Asking me that question

1672
01:28:35,072 --> 01:28:40,960
Trying to play war games about to reveal

1673
01:28:41,216 --> 01:28:45,824
Figured it all out first off I would assume that there would be balloons

1674
01:28:47,360 --> 01:28:49,920
Waiting to come down like an election night

1675
01:28:51,200 --> 01:28:51,712
Second

1676
01:28:51,968 --> 01:28:52,736
You would be

1677
01:28:54,016 --> 01:28:56,576
Giddy like you would look at me with so much

1678
01:28:56,832 --> 01:29:00,160
Are you leaving in right right

1679
01:29:02,976 --> 01:29:04,512
Neither gets a gun

1680
01:29:04,768 --> 01:29:08,352
And I'm going to go with no well let's see actually a caller calls in

1681
01:29:08,608 --> 01:29:09,632
3 minutes after this

1682
01:29:09,888 --> 01:29:11,424
And ask him what he thinks about Donald

1683
01:29:12,192 --> 01:29:13,728
New York City

1684
01:29:13,984 --> 01:29:14,752
Are on the air

1685
01:29:15,776 --> 01:29:17,824
Hey Dallas how I change the New York City

1686
01:29:18,080 --> 01:29:20,128
Are you from New York

1687
01:29:22,432 --> 01:29:22,944
Call Grace

1688
01:29:23,456 --> 01:29:24,480
Donald Trump

1689
01:29:25,248 --> 01:29:26,016
Is he the real deal

1690
01:29:28,064 --> 01:29:31,648
The question is a new world order but if you can answer that for me

1691
01:29:32,160 --> 01:29:36,000
I have to judge a tree by its fruit

1692
01:29:39,584 --> 01:29:41,120
Americana

1693
01:29:41,888 --> 01:29:46,496
I don't completely trust

1694
01:29:53,920 --> 01:30:00,064
I think she might be

1695
01:30:01,088 --> 01:30:04,416
President

1696
01:30:09,792 --> 01:30:11,584
I just have to give him the benefit of the doubt but

1697
01:30:12,096 --> 01:30:13,120
Regardless

1698
01:30:13,376 --> 01:30:14,144
He's now

1699
01:30:14,912 --> 01:30:16,960
What I'd call the Tea Party

1700
01:30:17,984 --> 01:30:20,288
And so they want to destroy him in name

1701
01:30:20,800 --> 01:30:22,592
Do to try to her.

1702
01:30:22,848 --> 01:30:25,152
Truth

1703
01:30:25,408 --> 01:30:28,224
Watching very closely so I think

1704
01:30:31,808 --> 01:30:36,160
Frustrating

1705
01:30:36,928 --> 01:30:38,976
That's the same thing

1706
01:30:40,000 --> 01:30:42,816
There's no progress

1707
01:30:43,072 --> 01:30:45,632
Come on so this is ridiculous

1708
01:30:45,888 --> 01:30:48,704
Because we have to pretend there's progress being made when there's not

1709
01:30:48,960 --> 01:30:53,312
There's a couple things we can take from the does the first time use the word America

1710
01:30:53,568 --> 01:30:57,664
Americana guy

1711
01:30:57,920 --> 01:30:58,944
That's kind of big

1712
01:30:59,456 --> 01:31:00,992
And then also you say

1713
01:31:01,248 --> 01:31:03,296
I don't trust him but that doesn't matter

1714
01:31:04,064 --> 01:31:05,088
Please freezing

1715
01:31:05,344 --> 01:31:07,648
With the same things he said this whole time

1716
01:31:08,160 --> 01:31:09,184
Slightly differently

1717
01:31:09,440 --> 01:31:10,720
So there is warming

1718
01:31:10,976 --> 01:31:12,512
But it's still the same message

1719
01:31:13,024 --> 01:31:15,328
I like what he says I don't think I can trust

1720
01:31:15,840 --> 01:31:19,168
I don't think he's trustworthy like it or not

1721
01:31:19,424 --> 01:31:20,960
He's saying things that we have

1722
01:31:21,216 --> 01:31:23,008
To defend

1723
01:31:24,544 --> 01:31:26,080
Give me a prediction

1724
01:31:29,920 --> 01:31:32,224
Does it go from this like

1725
01:31:32,480 --> 01:31:32,992
Tepid

1726
01:31:35,552 --> 01:31:38,368
Throated 1776

1727
01:31:38,624 --> 01:31:39,136
2.0

1728
01:31:39,392 --> 01:31:41,184
You can't ask me that cuz I know some

1729
01:31:41,440 --> 01:31:41,952
Something

1730
01:31:42,976 --> 01:31:44,768
I can't answer any questions

1731
01:31:45,024 --> 01:31:47,840
The next week or so of the show

1732
01:31:48,096 --> 01:31:49,632
The come down the line

1733
01:31:50,144 --> 01:31:51,680
He's not going full throttle

1734
01:31:53,472 --> 01:31:54,240
I don't know.

1735
01:31:54,496 --> 01:31:56,032
This is really starting to f*** with my head

1736
01:31:56,800 --> 01:31:57,312
I don't know what he

1737
01:31:57,568 --> 01:31:58,080
He's doing

1738
01:31:58,336 --> 01:31:59,872
Yeah

1739
01:32:00,640 --> 01:32:01,920
It's super weird

1740
01:32:04,480 --> 01:32:08,064
This is the 15th episode of our investigation

1741
01:32:08,320 --> 01:32:08,832
B nut

1742
01:32:09,344 --> 01:32:09,856
That can't be true

1743
01:32:10,112 --> 01:32:11,136
This is just such a

1744
01:32:11,648 --> 01:32:12,416
So much edging

1745
01:32:12,672 --> 01:32:13,696
Nonsense

1746
01:32:14,208 --> 01:32:15,232
It's driving me nuts

1747
01:32:15,488 --> 01:32:16,512
And I'm mad about it now

1748
01:32:17,024 --> 01:32:17,792
I used to be like

1749
01:32:18,304 --> 01:32:19,072
This is interesting

1750
01:32:19,328 --> 01:32:19,840
Now I want

1751
01:32:20,096 --> 01:32:24,960
This to be over I want him to f****** support Trump already

1752
01:32:25,216 --> 01:32:26,752
Cuz I kind of

1753
01:32:27,264 --> 01:32:28,032
You know what

1754
01:32:28,288 --> 01:32:29,824
I kind of understand why

1755
01:32:30,336 --> 01:32:31,360
He's going to eventually

1756
01:32:35,456 --> 01:32:38,784
Or or way worse

1757
01:32:39,296 --> 01:32:40,576
Yeah

1758
01:32:40,832 --> 01:32:41,600
Magical elements

1759
01:32:41,856 --> 01:32:43,904
The real reason was going to be something out of left

1760
01:32:45,696 --> 01:32:51,840
I had a 6-hour dream and now strumpet 1776 to

1761
01:32:56,960 --> 01:32:58,240
The end result of

1762
01:32:58,496 --> 01:32:59,264
Based on the

1763
01:32:59,520 --> 01:33:01,568
The month that I've listened to in the lead-up

1764
01:33:01,824 --> 01:33:02,848
I know what's going to happen

1765
01:33:03,360 --> 01:33:04,384
The end result

1766
01:33:04,896 --> 01:33:05,664
Behind the scenes

1767
01:33:05,920 --> 01:33:07,456
Is going to be someone lies to him

1768
01:33:08,224 --> 01:33:08,992
Yeah that's it

1769
01:33:11,808 --> 01:33:13,344
Sort of been operating off of

1770
01:33:13,600 --> 01:33:14,624
Or least need suspicion

1771
01:33:14,880 --> 01:33:19,488
We've had for a long time

1772
01:33:19,744 --> 01:33:21,024
I don't know anymore

1773
01:33:21,280 --> 01:33:22,048
I have no bearings

1774
01:33:22,816 --> 01:33:28,960
Kirby Millennium episode

1775
01:33:29,216 --> 01:33:31,520
People

1776
01:33:34,080 --> 01:33:35,360
Every single day

1777
01:33:35,616 --> 01:33:38,176
Crazy Andy

1778
01:33:40,224 --> 01:33:43,808
Alex has no intention of supporting Trump

1779
01:33:44,064 --> 01:33:46,112
Same way I have no intention of becoming

1780
01:33:46,880 --> 01:33:47,648
Indeed

1781
01:33:48,160 --> 01:33:49,184
31 more Clippers

1782
01:33:49,440 --> 01:33:52,256
The Parting Shot Alex painting humility

1783
01:33:52,512 --> 01:33:53,280
Disgusting way

1784
01:33:53,536 --> 01:33:54,816
I don't want to be the leader

1785
01:33:59,424 --> 01:34:00,192
I have to

1786
01:34:01,216 --> 01:34:04,800
I just cannot get up here and not tell you the truth go f*** yourself

1787
01:34:05,056 --> 01:34:05,824
So

1788
01:34:07,360 --> 01:34:07,872
I don't want

1789
01:34:08,640 --> 01:34:09,152
Look

1790
01:34:10,176 --> 01:34:10,688
I don't want to be there

1791
01:34:11,456 --> 01:34:12,992
I want to hear cuz I'm so awesome

1792
01:34:13,248 --> 01:34:19,392
Awesome

1793
01:34:19,648 --> 01:34:20,928
Truth all the time

1794
01:34:21,184 --> 01:34:21,696
I have to

1795
01:34:22,208 --> 01:34:23,488
I can't not

1796
01:34:23,744 --> 01:34:25,024
And when I'm wrong

1797
01:34:25,280 --> 01:34:25,792
Listen

1798
01:34:26,560 --> 01:34:27,328
I called myself out for

1799
01:34:29,120 --> 01:34:34,240
I was so wrong

1800
01:34:34,496 --> 01:34:39,104
Everybody knows that two years later even though they knew I was lying

1801
01:34:39,360 --> 01:34:41,920
It comes true and I was like see I told you I wasn't

1802
01:34:42,176 --> 01:34:42,688
I never lie

1803
01:34:42,944 --> 01:34:43,968
Even when I do

1804
01:34:44,224 --> 01:34:44,736
Sneaky

1805
01:34:44,992 --> 01:34:46,272
I'm lying all the time

1806
01:34:46,528 --> 01:34:47,552
So if but

1807
01:34:47,808 --> 01:34:48,576
I'm a liar in

1808
01:34:48,832 --> 01:34:52,928
In a good way

1809
01:34:53,184 --> 01:34:53,952
Is there

1810
01:34:54,208 --> 01:34:56,256
Come to the end of our investigation Chung

1811
01:34:58,048 --> 01:34:58,560
Furious

1812
01:34:59,072 --> 01:34:59,840
A very subdued

1813
01:35:00,096 --> 01:35:01,120
Furious but

1814
01:35:01,376 --> 01:35:02,400
Furious nonetheless

1815
01:35:03,680 --> 01:35:04,192
I don't know man

1816
01:35:05,472 --> 01:35:10,080
This episodes only like an hour and a half and I apologized episode

1817
01:35:10,336 --> 01:35:11,872
But to be fair I'm thrilled

1818
01:35:12,128 --> 01:35:12,640
Cuz it's the weekend

1819
01:35:13,920 --> 01:35:15,200
I think one of the issues

1820
01:35:15,456 --> 01:35:18,016
You know if this if this episode it happened

1821
01:35:18,528 --> 01:35:19,040
2 months

1822
01:35:19,296 --> 01:35:25,440
We would have really been able to pee off on all this stuff

1823
01:35:25,696 --> 01:35:28,000
We've already gone

1824
01:35:28,512 --> 01:35:29,536
Is just like it just

1825
01:35:29,792 --> 01:35:31,328
You said this is so much edging

1826
01:35:33,376 --> 01:35:34,912
F****** do it

1827
01:35:36,704 --> 01:35:37,216
We got to figure

1828
01:35:37,728 --> 01:35:38,496
We got to figure some of this

1829
01:35:39,264 --> 01:35:40,288
Something's Gotta break

1830
01:35:43,104 --> 01:35:43,616
I don't know

1831
01:35:43,872 --> 01:35:46,944
Cuz the next next investigation we're going to record is over the weekend

1832
01:35:48,736 --> 01:35:49,248
Like two weeks

1833
01:35:49,504 --> 01:35:54,368

1834
01:35:54,624 --> 01:35:55,136

1837
01:35:57,440 --> 01:35:58,208

Dead Poets Society who cares

1848
01:36:33,792 --> 01:36:35,072
The other side

01:36:36,608 --> 01:36:39,680

Determined

1875
01:37:48,032 --> 01:37:52,384
Probably some good simultaneously 99 at 9

1876
01:37:53,408 --> 01:37:56,224
September 9th at 9 that would make the most

1877
01:37:58,016 --> 01:37:59,296
But that will do a handstand

1878
01:37:59,552 --> 01:38:04,416
The pope will also be showing of the black pope will be there

1879
01:38:07,744 --> 01:38:10,560

Larry Nichols

01:38:17,728 --> 01:38:19,264
So you know one guy was not going to come

1882
01:38:19,520 --> 01:38:22,336
I told you I don't know if

1883
01:38:22,592 --> 01:38:27,712
I've only seen one that I've ever seen

1884
01:38:27,968 --> 01:38:28,736
He could be a puppet

1885
01:38:30,528 --> 01:38:32,320
I have no idea

1886
01:38:32,576 --> 01:38:37,696
A creature from Sesame Street

1887
01:38:38,208 --> 01:38:39,488
Could you give me

1888
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:42,304
One more thing about him that probably piss

1889
01:38:42,560 --> 01:38:43,328
Pisses me off the most

1890
01:38:46,400 --> 01:38:46,912
No

1891
01:38:47,936 --> 01:38:48,704
