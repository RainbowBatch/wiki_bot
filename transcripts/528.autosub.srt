What's up

8
00:01:10,656 --> 00:01:15,264
My bright spots that I don't know this may be a little bit of an unconventional brightspark cuz I don't know if it's bright but

9
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,544
It's been giving me a little bit of

10
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:17,312
Mirth

11
00:01:17,568 --> 00:01:20,896
Okay I noticed that I have

12
00:01:21,152 --> 00:01:22,176
Constantly

13
00:01:22,688 --> 00:01:23,712
Have this thought

14
00:01:24,992 --> 00:01:28,064
But it it's almost sounded defensive in my head

15
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,600
Or almost apologetic

16
00:01:31,136 --> 00:01:32,416
Hi I love my cat

17
00:01:35,744 --> 00:01:37,792
Excuses within my own for

18
00:01:40,352 --> 00:01:46,496
Very open emotional look I love my cat

19
00:01:46,752 --> 00:01:48,032
Sorry everybody I love that

20
00:01:48,288 --> 00:01:50,848
I apologize for sharing my

21
00:01:51,104 --> 00:01:57,248
I'm burdening you with my emotions of Love toward no one has expressed any negative feelings

22
00:01:58,272 --> 00:02:00,576
It's because she does break a lot of stuff around here

23
00:02:00,832 --> 00:02:02,880
She makes a lot of messages torn up my couch

24
00:02:03,136 --> 00:02:03,648
Yeah

25
00:02:07,488 --> 00:02:12,864
My dog is an absolute nightmare

26
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:19,264
Understand your feelings there there's a little bit of pets having that requires you to make some Apollo

Dad I don't know if you remember

35
00:02:40,512 --> 00:02:44,864
It's been a while back we wish somebody a happy birthday from analects

36
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,936
I believe that was our last episode

37
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:49,728
Now what

38
00:02:49,984 --> 00:02:52,288
Apparently happened as people have not been

39
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:58,688
I'm taking our advice which is you are somehow accidentally the person who gave a birthday wish

40
00:02:58,944 --> 00:03:05,088
Let it ride

41
00:03:05,344 --> 00:03:07,136
Believe it's that the name was wrong

42
00:03:07,392 --> 00:03:13,536
CIAA difficult to pull this subterfuge off

43
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:16,096
Quick little

44
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:21,984
Audio adjustments to the

45
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:28,384
Let me think about how many names I've said over the course of this show could splice in

46
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:34,528
Absolutely we have to do this is almost an admission of laziness on their part

47
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:38,368
I just like they were becoming Delilah

48
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:45,280
Song request

49
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:48,096

And then of course I have to witness

57

Witness eyewitness

58
00:04:18,303 --> 00:04:24,447
By observing disdain I make it real

59
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:31,103
Or watching my twitch stream

60
00:04:31,359 --> 00:04:37,503
It turns out they are having their 18-year anniversary

61
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:38,271
Kind of

62
00:04:38,527 --> 00:04:44,671
They both discovered our show and they waited until their anniversary to reveal it to each other cuz and now their 18th anniversary

63
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:48,767
Marriage can get a department absent

64
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:53,375

70
00:05:12,063 --> 00:05:15,391
At a certain point do we do everybody

71
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:17,695
I don't want to be the one who says you know what

72
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:18,975
You're the last one

73
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:22,047

Today we have an interesting episode to go over Ruby talking about a little bit of action

79
00:05:48,927 --> 00:05:49,439
From

80
00:05:49,695 --> 00:05:51,487

Super Bowl Sunday turning and looking up there having a thought before you finish the blackjack

83
00:06:03,007 --> 00:06:09,151
Very recently before we started recording

84
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:10,687
And I'm

85
00:06:10,943 --> 00:06:12,735
I got to be honest with that

86
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:14,783
Not a lot of content

87
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:17,087
Not right lot of stuff going on

88
00:06:17,343 --> 00:06:23,487
And I think that one of the things that is that like why we got these

89
00:06:23,743 --> 00:06:25,023
Trying to figure it out

90
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:30,143
Alex is really confused now that he likes the Boogaloo boys and like when I can't really pin this on them

91
00:06:30,399 --> 00:06:32,959
Don't really know exactly what to do s***

92
00:06:33,471 --> 00:06:38,335
And I think he's biding his time a little bit cuz tomorrow as we're recording this on Sunday

93
00:06:38,591 --> 00:06:39,103
Monday

94
00:06:39,359 --> 00:06:41,407

00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:34,303

Heroin

136

Freakishly large

137
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:21,407
This episode happening before a lot of stuff

138
00:09:21,663 --> 00:09:23,711
During the Superbowl would have happened

139
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:26,271
And so if anything was particularly Masonic

140
00:09:26,527 --> 00:09:29,087
Devilish

141
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:32,415
Alex didn't have any comments on that during

142
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:34,207
Michelle said we were going to have to wait

143
00:09:34,463 --> 00:09:34,975
To find out

144
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:35,999
About that

145
00:09:36,255 --> 00:09:37,791
Will handle what Superbowl

146
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:38,559
Commercials

147
00:09:38,815 --> 00:09:40,351
There are people are going to talk about

148
00:09:40,607 --> 00:09:46,751
It's almost kind of fitting that we talked about Alex's commercials on the day of the Super Bowl the thing that is known for its commercial

149
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:50,079
I wouldn't say that's almost fitting

150
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:51,871
You're just saying it's accidental

151
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:00,575
People think this is weird

152
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:12,863
You says it a totally normal fast yes it's one of my favorite things

153
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:15,679
I'm not weird

154
00:10:17,983 --> 00:10:20,287
People started this is weird

155
00:10:20,543 --> 00:10:22,847
I'm touching my nose with tweezers

156
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:29,503
So here is just

157
00:10:29,759 --> 00:10:32,063
The first taste of one of these commercials

158
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:33,087
That's just

159
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:35,903
Let me set the scene for you

160
00:10:36,671 --> 00:10:37,951
Alex is sitting there

161
00:10:38,463 --> 00:10:44,607
Bookshelf behind him with a bookshelf behind the other side there's like a

162
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:47,423
We can't see much of it until he's sitting there

163
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:53,823
And he's like looking at the camera if I have just been injured my ears have perked up at this visual because this

164
00:10:54,079 --> 00:11:00,223
This is clearly a law commercial right there are visual similarities

165
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:01,503
Office commercials have

166
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:07,391
Their uniform books on the Shelf Alex's lacking bat

167
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:10,207
Thank you for the laughs

168
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:14,815
Huge Juma but was competition

169
00:11:15,327 --> 00:11:15,839
My goodness

170
00:11:16,095 --> 00:11:17,375
I could have been braced you

171
00:11:17,631 --> 00:11:19,423
And just my shoulder

172
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,727
I got to pause already commercial

173
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:29,151
Exactly

174
00:11:29,663 --> 00:11:34,271
I just feel it literally

175
00:11:37,343 --> 00:11:37,855
Takashi

176
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:41,695
And I knew she was control I knew was putting up

177
00:11:42,719 --> 00:11:45,023
Shoes with giving fake dates

178
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:49,375
21

179
00:11:49,631 --> 00:11:51,423
Show me black people

180
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:54,751
Believing in some magic trick

181
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:56,287
Still president

182
00:11:56,543 --> 00:12:00,895
We're going to have to save ourselves

183
00:12:04,735 --> 00:12:05,247
How to restore

184
00:12:09,855 --> 00:12:13,951
Admitting the truth there's a lot of positive things the world awaken to the New World Order

185
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:19,583
So now we know the truth and now

186
00:12:21,119 --> 00:12:22,143
Every product

187
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:23,935
You hear me on here

188
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:41,599
Future orders

189
00:12:43,647 --> 00:12:44,671
They were having trouble with

190
00:12:44,927 --> 00:12:47,999
I think you might now a start to understand why I

191
00:12:48,511 --> 00:12:51,327
Completely fascinated by this

192
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:56,703
Amazing

193
00:12:56,959 --> 00:12:57,983
Understand how to

194
00:12:58,239 --> 00:13:00,543
To keep content and Commercial separate

195
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:03,615
During commercial break

196
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:08,735
Because I was always like you know why he does this

197
00:13:08,991 --> 00:13:15,135
Because he can't do it in his own commercials he's selling other stuff so in his in his show he's going to sell you stuff

198
00:13:15,391 --> 00:13:16,927
I realize this is just

199
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:19,231
I just sell it when he's talking to his kids

200
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:22,303
He's like Robin but you need to go to school you need to get good grades

201
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:28,447
And the best way to do that is with my Suite of products

202
00:13:30,495 --> 00:13:36,639
I think it's a mixture of that and I think it's just habitual I think like he's gotten so used to that being

203
00:13:36,895 --> 00:13:41,759
How ads work for Ira

204
00:13:42,271 --> 00:13:47,647
Who sings like okay this is a commercial spot I need to talk about the product

205
00:13:47,903 --> 00:13:50,207
This is a commercial to try and get you to buy at

206
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:54,303
Alright I'm going to complain to rescue

207
00:13:54,559 --> 00:13:57,631
Alex we're just going to be just want to cut one clean one look

208
00:13:57,887 --> 00:14:02,239
You can do that whole thing we just want to cut one clean one as an alternative if it just

209
00:14:02,495 --> 00:14:04,799
In case we need to stay here for a little while

210
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:08,383
The do that the first minute off that just go ahead and

211
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:09,663
Let me ask you a question

212
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:12,991
How does the you had an argument with

213
00:14:13,247 --> 00:14:15,039
You relate to the selling of The Prado

214
00:14:15,551 --> 00:14:21,695
Hey it's what he was on his mind was f***** up and they sat him down and he recorded rambling

215
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:27,327
Tim Tebow for the Superbowl commercial

216
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:31,679
Confront the bookshelf

217
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:35,263
They're like let's see what we could use

218
00:14:35,775 --> 00:14:41,919
Christopher Guest movies Atlanta listen we're just going to roll tape and you yeah

219
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:46,783
That was weird

220
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:48,319
Nothing

221
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:53,695
Born at pivot commercial you do apologize to anybody in a commercial

222
00:14:53,951 --> 00:15:00,095
You don't need to point out that you never lie and then equivocate on it

223
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:02,911
Commercials

224
00:15:03,167 --> 00:15:04,191
Commercial

225
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:05,471
There's no

226
00:15:05,727 --> 00:15:11,871
Plug in the ghetto product wait there's no plug in the commercials but I can't watch the show without hearing plug-in

227
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:14,943
Imagine a world

228
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:15,711
Without

229
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:19,295
Imagine being buried alive

230
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:22,879
Coffee Limited

231
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:29,023
France

232
00:15:29,535 --> 00:15:30,303
Maybe 5% of

233
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:39,007
First of all what numbers show even higher second of all that is not where the term dead ringer come from

234
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:51,551
Of the person Six Feet Under

235
00:15:55,647 --> 00:15:56,671
What I'm getting at here

236
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:11,007
Barry alive if we have any chance to metaphysically without filtering out

237
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:14,079
Ticketmaster Sherman

238
00:16:14,335 --> 00:16:15,359
Providence to get out of this

239
00:16:15,871 --> 00:16:18,687
Admit the globalists are trying to bury Us Alive lockdown

240
00:16:18,943 --> 00:16:19,455
Remember

241
00:16:20,223 --> 00:16:24,063
Product in there

242
00:16:24,319 --> 00:16:26,111
He's selling God to you

243
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:31,231
He's giving you a good old sales pitch forgot that's why we got to turn to God

244
00:16:31,743 --> 00:16:32,767
It's so bizarre

245
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:36,607
It is unpacking the weirdest unbelievably bizarre

246
00:16:37,119 --> 00:16:37,631
That's weird

247
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:44,031
I mean it's not that bizarre that he has this weird fake etymology Academy

248
00:16:44,287 --> 00:16:47,871
Balaji of dead ringer

249
00:16:48,895 --> 00:16:55,039
My dad told me that that's where the turns from a repeated to you on it

250
00:16:55,551 --> 00:16:57,087
Ship that goes on on Infowars

251
00:16:57,343 --> 00:17:01,695
Just like I saw this in a meme one so someone decided

252
00:17:01,951 --> 00:17:02,463
That was a

253
00:17:02,719 --> 00:17:03,231
Clip

254
00:17:03,487 --> 00:17:04,255
Two are

255
00:17:04,511 --> 00:17:05,023
When he's take

256
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:06,303
They scored it

257
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:09,375
Music under her eye but that wasn't a joke

258
00:17:10,143 --> 00:17:12,703
Somebody was like we got to put that on

259
00:17:13,727 --> 00:17:16,799
Because it's important to have an interstitial

260
00:17:17,055 --> 00:17:23,199
Like if you watch the video of it they have found b-roll of someone scratching at a coffin love it

261
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:24,479
Yes please

262
00:17:24,735 --> 00:17:30,879
Absolutely.

263
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:32,159
This is so dumb

264
00:17:32,415 --> 00:17:32,927
How long are they

265
00:17:33,183 --> 00:17:35,487
Commercial spot I mean it depends

266
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:38,815
Do they run like for commercials in a row

267
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:40,351
It depends

268
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:47,519
But how long how long the commercials are the first break of the hour is from about 25 minutes

269
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:48,543
36-minute mark

270
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:51,615
And so that one's usually just like one

271
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:52,639
Sharaya man

272
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:56,735
The other commercial breaks be kind of very but there's like maybe

273
00:17:58,527 --> 00:17:59,807
And it's all just him talk

274
00:18:00,063 --> 00:18:00,575
Wow

275
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:03,135
But sometimes it's multiple of the commercials

276
00:18:03,391 --> 00:18:05,439
Like one of them is done and then another will

277
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:07,999
Surreal

278
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:10,047
I'm just blown away by that

279
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:16,447
Just really wild it's indicative of a lack of anyone wanting to give you money to advertise that's for sure

280
00:18:18,751 --> 00:18:23,359
You don't even want to give you money for advertising because you can't afford to pay someone for a good ass

281
00:18:23,615 --> 00:18:24,127
A newt

282
00:18:24,383 --> 00:18:30,527
Jody Watley advertise your own s*** if it's talked about dead ringers and such

283
00:18:30,783 --> 00:18:31,807
Blakemore

284
00:18:32,063 --> 00:18:32,831
Random

285
00:18:33,087 --> 00:18:34,367
Not true facts

286
00:18:35,135 --> 00:18:35,903
In my commercial

287
00:18:36,159 --> 00:18:36,671
Wow

288
00:18:36,927 --> 00:18:38,719
Alex is your guide

289
00:18:38,975 --> 00:18:40,255
Sick of this Geico

290
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:43,071
Gecko nonsense I want the Geico Gecko

291
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:48,703
To tell me that geckos did not evolve in they were actually from a different planet and then be like by the way

292
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:49,727
We sell graded

293
00:18:50,239 --> 00:18:51,263
That's what I want

294
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:57,919
The first hour about of this show is a lot of it is about Alex's disgusting like child abuse

295
00:18:58,175 --> 00:18:59,455
You stuff and so we're not going

296
00:18:59,711 --> 00:19:00,991
We're not going to let any of that

297
00:19:01,503 --> 00:19:05,087
And we will instead get to some of the content

298
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:06,879
In the 2nd hour

299
00:19:07,135 --> 00:19:08,415
Well first of all got to say

300
00:19:08,671 --> 00:19:11,743
Ali Alexander breaks his silence

301
00:19:12,511 --> 00:19:16,351
Did not realize he was silent

302
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:22,751
Yes

303
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:24,287
Get to bed in a little bit

304
00:19:24,543 --> 00:19:27,615
And the fire 12th generation of who is responsible

305
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:28,895
For January 2nd

306
00:19:29,151 --> 00:19:31,455
Yeah and then the rest of the time is kind of

307
00:19:32,223 --> 00:19:32,991
Treading water

308
00:19:34,015 --> 00:19:36,063
I want to say this can't censor truth

309
00:19:36,319 --> 00:19:36,831
Dot-com

310
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:39,135
Dot-com

311
00:19:39,391 --> 00:19:40,671
URL app

312
00:19:41,439 --> 00:19:42,207
The fancy

313
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:45,535
Call EE. Because I was spending a lot of time this weekend doing research

314
00:19:46,047 --> 00:19:46,815
Amanda

315
00:19:48,095 --> 00:19:49,887
Shows watching interviews watching

316
00:19:50,143 --> 00:19:51,167
Videos are pugs

317
00:19:51,423 --> 00:19:51,935
Is there

318
00:19:52,959 --> 00:19:55,263
My pillow guys to our report pretty good

Pretty good it is on there isn't it yeah

320
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:00,383
First order of business

321
00:20:01,151 --> 00:20:06,783
I take great umbrage with someone saying I did research on banned. Video.

322
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:09,343
Research

323
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:11,647
You're killing time watching your employees

324
00:20:12,671 --> 00:20:17,791
Merriam-Webster can do research into his own book but beyond that nobody

325
00:20:18,303 --> 00:20:19,839
Alex did post

326
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:24,447
Mike Lindell MyPillow his documentary absolute proof

327
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:25,727
Which is hilarious

328
00:20:26,239 --> 00:20:28,031
Because it's supposed to be absolute proof

329
00:20:28,287 --> 00:20:30,847
Of the election being stolen and Alex says it's

330
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:31,615
Pretty good

331
00:20:31,871 --> 00:20:35,455
It's pretty good review shouldn't be pretty good absolute proof

332
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:38,271
Pretty good

333
00:20:38,527 --> 00:20:39,807
It won the palme

334
00:20:44,671 --> 00:20:45,439
Plumbob

335
00:20:48,255 --> 00:20:48,767
The thing

336
00:20:49,023 --> 00:20:55,167
Is I got inundated with messages from people asking me to cover the documentary

337
00:20:55,423 --> 00:20:56,703
A little bit earlier

338
00:20:56,959 --> 00:20:57,983
Socially

339
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:03,615
I was I was trying to find a way to make an episode out of it cuz

340
00:21:03,871 --> 00:21:07,199
There was public interest in that but it just it was going to happen

341
00:21:07,455 --> 00:21:08,991
It's so poorly made

342
00:21:09,247 --> 00:21:10,783
Did There's jump Cuts all over the place

343
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:13,599
There's no new information really that I saw

344
00:21:13,855 --> 00:21:16,159
Yeah I'll be brought to the table it's just not interesting

345
00:21:16,928 --> 00:21:23,072
I read that he made it in 6 days working 21-hour days

346
00:21:23,328 --> 00:21:25,120
Pray that's what I that's what I read

347
00:21:25,376 --> 00:21:28,192
And my first thought was like well that's a guy who's clearly

348
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:31,008
Pumping himself up being like look at how great I am

349
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,800
The way you described it though

350
00:21:33,056 --> 00:21:36,128
I could see Yoko Cattle Man being up for so weak make

351
00:21:36,384 --> 00:21:38,688
Do something that bad reserve for muriatic

352
00:21:38,944 --> 00:21:39,712
He's

353
00:21:40,736 --> 00:21:41,504
Cabeza

354
00:21:42,016 --> 00:21:43,808
That's behind him now OK Google pillows

355
00:21:44,832 --> 00:21:47,392
I don't know anything what makes his pillow so good

356
00:21:47,648 --> 00:21:52,256
I don't know anything about the guy and I don't want to ever make fun of someone for having a

357
00:21:52,512 --> 00:21:57,632
Addiction

358
00:21:57,888 --> 00:22:00,192
It's just a bad documentary crash

359
00:22:01,728 --> 00:22:02,496
I just

360
00:22:02,752 --> 00:22:04,544
I resented watching

361
00:22:05,568 --> 00:22:08,128
The only thing that I felt like at all

362
00:22:08,384 --> 00:22:09,664
Okay about was like well

363
00:22:10,176 --> 00:22:12,224
This is going to be played in court

364
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,248
2 hours

365
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:14,272
Yeah

366
00:22:14,528 --> 00:22:15,808
Is 2 hours long

367
00:22:17,856 --> 00:22:18,880
2 hours long

368
00:22:19,136 --> 00:22:21,440
Yeah good movies are about an hour

369
00:22:22,464 --> 00:22:23,488
Yeah

370
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:25,536
It was a it was a struggle.

371
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:27,328
To get through I was very bored

372
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:30,144
So I'm sorry but who really wanted that

373
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:36,544
Apparently you want to watch it I took video letter about that

374
00:22:37,824 --> 00:22:38,336
But

375
00:22:38,848 --> 00:22:39,360
LOL

376
00:22:39,872 --> 00:22:40,640
So

377
00:22:40,896 --> 00:22:42,176
Alex is pumping up

378
00:22:42,432 --> 00:22:43,200
This

379
00:22:43,712 --> 00:22:44,480
URL

380
00:22:44,736 --> 00:22:45,248
But he's got

381
00:22:45,504 --> 00:22:46,784
That you can't censor truth

382
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,064
Dot-com

383
00:22:49,344 --> 00:22:50,624
A lot of comments

384
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:54,976
We can't share banned. Video

385
00:22:55,488 --> 00:22:56,512
348

386
00:22:57,536 --> 00:22:58,560
I do website

387
00:22:58,816 --> 00:22:59,584
Probably stopped

388
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:00,608
20 of those comments

389
00:23:00,864 --> 00:23:01,376
Different

390
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:03,680
Everybody doesn't care about your comments I read them

391
00:23:05,984 --> 00:23:08,032
Nazi Nazi Nazi

392
00:23:08,288 --> 00:23:09,056
This day band

393
00:23:09,568 --> 00:23:13,152
The term Bandit video about a year ago on Twitter Facebook Google

394
00:23:13,408 --> 00:23:13,920
You do all that

395
00:23:14,176 --> 00:23:14,688
Just a URL

396
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,736
Assistant week

397
00:23:16,992 --> 00:23:17,760
New York

398
00:23:18,528 --> 00:23:19,040
Link

399
00:23:19,296 --> 00:23:20,576
To the very database

400
00:23:21,344 --> 00:23:22,368
And the very same videos

401
00:23:22,624 --> 00:23:24,416
Like a disease

402
00:23:24,672 --> 00:23:26,976
2020election center.com and

403
00:23:27,232 --> 00:23:27,744
Some of the other

404
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,048
Maybe about 6 or 7

405
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:34,400
Trying to fight a disease

406
00:23:34,656 --> 00:23:35,680
Dot-com

407
00:23:35,936 --> 00:23:42,080
This is a loser strategy that Alex keeps gauging in any he's very open about his band of Asia

408
00:23:42,336 --> 00:23:43,616
Strategy

409
00:23:44,128 --> 00:23:50,272
To the point where anyone paying attention could stifle this

410
00:23:50,528 --> 00:23:51,296
She is

411
00:23:51,552 --> 00:23:55,648
Eventually people quit playing whack-a-mole is they never hit the bowl enough

412
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:56,672
You know

413
00:23:57,184 --> 00:23:58,976
So he's he's got to be like this

414
00:23:59,744 --> 00:24:01,024
You guys know you're not never going

415
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,048
So just

416
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:08,960
I think that is the implicit threat yeah okay yeah I've got can't censor truth

417
00:24:09,216 --> 00:24:15,360
And also for other ones I haven't started promoting yet you're going to knock this one out already

418
00:24:18,176 --> 00:24:20,480
It seems like a waste of everyone's time

419
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:23,040
So what's not a waste of time

420
00:24:23,296 --> 00:24:23,808
Is ads

421
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:24,832
Let's get back to this

422
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:26,368
Commercials cuz they are way more fun

423
00:24:27,648 --> 00:24:28,416
I shall stop them

424
00:24:30,464 --> 00:24:31,232
Because they work

425
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:32,512
The real

426
00:24:33,024 --> 00:24:33,536
Powerful

427
00:24:35,584 --> 00:24:37,376
That's for reason

428
00:24:37,888 --> 00:24:40,704
34 reasons

429
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,496
I know those are two reasons

430
00:24:49,152 --> 00:24:52,992
I love your idea that you didn't even gather his thoughts before

431
00:24:54,272 --> 00:24:55,040
This is

432
00:24:55,296 --> 00:24:57,344
Pure stream-of-consciousness yeah

433
00:24:58,368 --> 00:24:59,392
Even down to the like

434
00:24:59,904 --> 00:25:02,720
I don't know if this is an action movie line or what like

435
00:25:02,976 --> 00:25:05,280
I sell products for two reasons

436
00:25:05,792 --> 00:25:10,656
Because I came here to chew bubblegum and kick ass now this is not available thing

437
00:25:11,168 --> 00:25:11,680
Alex

438
00:25:11,936 --> 00:25:13,984
Not writing things down

439
00:25:14,752 --> 00:25:19,360
So here's another commercial that's not a commercial there's I don't believe there's a plug in the shed at all

440
00:25:19,616 --> 00:25:21,152
The world is awake

441
00:25:21,664 --> 00:25:22,944
The world

442
00:25:23,968 --> 00:25:24,992
Understand the globalist

443
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,296
They are discovering the global

444
00:25:27,808 --> 00:25:28,320
The elites

445
00:25:28,832 --> 00:25:30,112
Manipulation CFR

446
00:25:31,392 --> 00:25:32,672
Bilderberg Group

447
00:25:32,928 --> 00:25:33,952
Damian bro

448
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:35,488
Club of Rome

449
00:25:40,352 --> 00:25:41,376
The quicker picker-upper

450
00:25:41,888 --> 00:25:42,912
They had to come out the open

451
00:25:43,424 --> 00:25:44,704
Human freedom

452
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:46,240
Because they're actually losing

453
00:25:46,752 --> 00:25:47,520
We have forced

454
00:25:47,776 --> 00:25:48,544
Then

455
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:49,312
In the open

456
00:25:54,432 --> 00:25:56,992
Humanity is winning in the plan

457
00:26:00,576 --> 00:26:01,856
That isn't Dental

458
00:26:02,112 --> 00:26:02,624
That is

459
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:03,648
Cereal

460
00:26:06,976 --> 00:26:07,744
Awesome God

461
00:26:15,424 --> 00:26:16,960
We'll Never Back Down

462
00:26:19,776 --> 00:26:25,664
A deck this is a wrestling promo are you just telling fear are you just telling Yaya

463
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:32,064
I think this is a tacit

464
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:34,624
Admission on his part on some level that like

465
00:26:35,392 --> 00:26:37,440
It's so much more profitable to make

466
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:41,280
The audience feel things into the direct them at product totally

467
00:26:41,536 --> 00:26:44,096
Make them feel like this visceral fear but that's

468
00:26:44,352 --> 00:26:45,376
It's matched

469
00:26:45,632 --> 00:26:46,144
With

470
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,448
The globalist are secretly losing of course

471
00:26:48,704 --> 00:26:49,216
OnCourse

472
00:26:49,472 --> 00:26:51,008
That combination is just like

473
00:26:51,264 --> 00:26:52,288
It must be

474
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:53,312
The most potent

475
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:54,592
Market

476
00:26:54,848 --> 00:26:57,664
Getting two people terrified

477
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:00,480
Then save it by giving you money

478
00:27:00,736 --> 00:27:02,272
They're going to feel better

479
00:27:02,528 --> 00:27:03,552
So you give them money

480
00:27:04,064 --> 00:27:04,832
And then he goes

481
00:27:05,088 --> 00:27:05,856
Hey we're winning

482
00:27:06,368 --> 00:27:08,672
But you got to say terrified cuz we haven't

483
00:27:08,928 --> 00:27:09,440
One yet

484
00:27:09,696 --> 00:27:14,048
Right then you give him more money and you feel like you're safe and so on and so forth

485
00:27:14,304 --> 00:27:16,096
Until you forgotten your own name

486
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:19,680
You know what name you'll never forget though blackjack

487
00:27:19,936 --> 00:27:22,752
Ali Alexander I will forget that name I promise you

488
00:27:23,008 --> 00:27:24,288
Holly Alexander is on

489
00:27:24,544 --> 00:27:27,616
To say that everyone is trying to get him

490
00:27:30,944 --> 00:27:31,712
I guess yes

491
00:27:31,968 --> 00:27:36,064
If he doesn't get away and then scream Ali Alexander free I'm going to be pissed

492
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:39,648
I think he does have actually some valid points about like people

493
00:27:39,904 --> 00:27:44,256
Posting on Twitter video of him Nicola Tennyson Alex

494
00:27:44,512 --> 00:27:47,328
At the Georgia Capitol was at the

495
00:27:47,584 --> 00:27:48,608
Washington Capitals

496
00:27:48,864 --> 00:27:54,240
Yeah that's that's fine people you want to complain about them getting that wrong

497
00:27:54,752 --> 00:27:56,544
Go for it

498
00:27:57,056 --> 00:27:57,824
Little bit

499
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:02,176
He's also know our people lying on the internet

500
00:28:03,968 --> 00:28:09,600
I would I would say that some people probably are but I would bet that even more people are just

501
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:13,440
Yeah just don't know that they're wrong

502
00:28:13,952 --> 00:28:15,744
Where is Ali is actually a liar

503
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,304
Grifter

504
00:28:19,072 --> 00:28:21,632
But he has some thoughts about

505
00:28:21,888 --> 00:28:22,400
Why

506
00:28:22,656 --> 00:28:23,424
They're coming after

507
00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:24,960
The GOP and such

508
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,264
Christians are all in

509
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:28,288
Republican Party

510
00:28:30,592 --> 00:28:32,128
We control the entire Republican

511
00:28:32,384 --> 00:28:33,920
Can party can't have that because

512
00:28:34,176 --> 00:28:35,968
Does bringing people who don't believe in

513
00:28:36,224 --> 00:28:37,760
Technocracy really people that gave

514
00:28:38,016 --> 00:28:38,528
The world

515
00:28:38,784 --> 00:28:40,576
Federalism Brother people that gave

516
00:28:40,832 --> 00:28:41,344
The world

517
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:44,160
Local isn't that work really people that stabilized

518
00:28:44,416 --> 00:28:47,232
The Republic when the pagans in The Barbarians even if

519
00:28:47,488 --> 00:28:48,512
Western Civilization

520
00:28:48,768 --> 00:28:51,584
Mute the Christians first

521
00:28:52,096 --> 00:28:52,608
So that week

522
00:28:52,864 --> 00:28:55,424
Can't Inspire the Republican party to take

523
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,960
Meaningful action against

524
00:28:57,216 --> 00:28:58,496
Is technocracy

525
00:28:59,008 --> 00:29:05,152
How is the Wild and Save

526
00:29:05,408 --> 00:29:06,432
Bebe

527
00:29:06,944 --> 00:29:11,296
The notion that all Christians are Republican means that you have a very

528
00:29:11,552 --> 00:29:17,696
Skewed version of who a Christian is absolutely

529
00:29:17,952 --> 00:29:20,000
I don't care for this guy much

530
00:29:21,536 --> 00:29:24,608
Didn't realize how much I enjoyed him being silent

531
00:29:24,864 --> 00:29:26,912
It is interesting to me

532
00:29:27,168 --> 00:29:27,936
The way you would put

533
00:29:28,192 --> 00:29:29,216
Did the way he puts that

534
00:29:29,728 --> 00:29:30,240
Of like

535
00:29:30,752 --> 00:29:36,896
It's good thing that the Christians stabilized us when the pagans were around

536
00:29:38,432 --> 00:29:40,480
Remember something about

537
00:29:41,248 --> 00:29:44,064
What was it that the pagans got done to them

538
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:45,088
Oh that's right

539
00:29:45,344 --> 00:29:46,624
A massive genocide

540
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,928
Wow he's just like

541
00:29:49,184 --> 00:29:53,024
It's a great idea for Christians to genocide people

542
00:29:53,536 --> 00:29:57,376
We're doing it now with this might be one of the reasons why it's

543
00:29:57,632 --> 00:29:58,400
Tough to get swan

544
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,520
Eat stuff

545
00:30:04,288 --> 00:30:08,128
And that leaves Alex I like he's got to do all these ads himself

546
00:30:08,896 --> 00:30:11,968
Again all shot in front of his bookshelf

547
00:30:12,224 --> 00:30:17,600
Totally they just let him roll some of them are really long

548
00:30:17,856 --> 00:30:21,440
Listen we're going to we're going to cut all of our commercials for the next 6 months

549
00:30:21,696 --> 00:30:24,512
We're going to do it in a 3-hour shoot today Alex

550
00:30:24,768 --> 00:30:25,280
Go

551
00:30:25,792 --> 00:30:27,840
Here is a long one

552
00:30:28,864 --> 00:30:29,888
The number one question

553
00:30:32,448 --> 00:30:33,216
Is Alex

554
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:34,752
Love your show

555
00:30:37,568 --> 00:30:38,848
You really mean the things you say

556
00:30:41,152 --> 00:30:41,920
Well I mean

557
00:30:49,856 --> 00:30:51,904
Incidentally that is kind of what I do for a living

558
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:54,208
I will say that is not

559
00:30:54,464 --> 00:30:55,744
Okay so you do not fight

560
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:56,768
But he's right that is

561
00:30:58,048 --> 00:30:58,560
You don't

562
00:30:58,816 --> 00:30:59,328
Need

563
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:00,608
Just sit there and put

564
00:31:02,656 --> 00:31:03,680
Or your face is

565
00:31:04,704 --> 00:31:05,472
The Dalai Lama

566
00:31:05,984 --> 00:31:06,496
Or your face

567
00:31:06,752 --> 00:31:07,776
The private Federal Reserve

568
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:08,800
Or your faith

569
00:31:11,616 --> 00:31:12,640
You just have to have a memory

570
00:31:13,664 --> 00:31:14,176
Remember

571
00:31:14,688 --> 00:31:15,456
The things I've laid out

572
00:31:18,272 --> 00:31:19,552
I have

573
00:31:24,672 --> 00:31:25,184
There's nothing

574
00:31:31,328 --> 00:31:32,096
Not because they were away

575
00:31:33,376 --> 00:31:34,400
Not because they were supposed

576
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:37,984
But because

577
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:40,288
They had this feeling of

578
00:31:40,544 --> 00:31:41,056
Invincibility

579
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,104
And this feeling everything's go

580
00:31:50,016 --> 00:31:50,784
Because they were just going off

581
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,160
Dottie you I can

582
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:57,440

Convictions

591
00:32:15,872 --> 00:32:16,896
Just on that subject

592
00:32:23,808 --> 00:32:24,320
The focus on

593
00:32:25,088 --> 00:32:26,624
Jose Jose you for real

594
00:32:27,648 --> 00:32:28,928
I'm as real as a heart attack

Girls getting hit by bus

596
00:32:31,488 --> 00:32:32,512

While that I've ever heard by Tire life

603
00:33:00,672 --> 00:33:02,208
There's no way that he could have ended

604
00:33:02,464 --> 00:33:03,232
Did that with

605
00:33:03,488 --> 00:33:05,280
Please buy Infowars store Prada

606
00:33:05,536 --> 00:33:08,352
There's no way he did

607
00:33:13,984 --> 00:33:18,848
Go to Infowars store don't need the 2-minute ramp-up it's a commercial people expect

608
00:33:22,944 --> 00:33:23,456
Also

609
00:33:24,224 --> 00:33:30,368
The only way you can make this more Cerritos if you're watching the video when he says I'm as serious as a heart attack I mysterious is getting hit by a

610
00:33:30,624 --> 00:33:34,208
Airbus cutting video of a goat getting hit by a bus

611
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:40,864
Video of like in Connecticut security cameras

612
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:41,632
The windshield

613
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:48,544
I don't know I think you could easily drive a human being insane

614
00:33:49,568 --> 00:33:52,640
You at 4 one day one person YouTube just chose

615
00:33:53,152 --> 00:33:55,200
And they're like no big it's just get bad today

616
00:33:55,456 --> 00:34:01,600
And it's only AJ's ads if they could drive a person insane instantly

617
00:34:03,648 --> 00:34:06,208
This is not real and I also was kind of thinking like

618
00:34:06,464 --> 00:34:06,976
I think

619
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,560
I'm coming around to the idea that maybe he's on drugs

620
00:34:11,072 --> 00:34:13,120
Like 8 just might just be a drug

621
00:34:13,376 --> 00:34:14,656
Could be

622
00:34:14,912 --> 00:34:16,192
Weird Behavior

623
00:34:16,448 --> 00:34:17,984
Yeah no

624
00:34:20,544 --> 00:34:25,152
Holly Alexander

625
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:32,320
Are you okay are you on methamphetamines

626
00:34:33,856 --> 00:34:34,880
Coffee

627
00:34:35,648 --> 00:34:37,184
Really upset about

628
00:34:41,536 --> 00:34:44,352
Set me up in prison all over the news

629
00:34:44,864 --> 00:34:48,448
Long has President Trump who's on trial starting tomorrow if this is serious

630
00:34:48,704 --> 00:34:52,288
Well I guess that settles it I mean he said he's not on coke

631
00:34:52,544 --> 00:34:53,312
Style

632
00:34:54,336 --> 00:34:54,848
Yep

633
00:34:55,104 --> 00:34:57,152
I don't have any evidence

634
00:34:57,408 --> 00:35:03,552
Instead he's ever pissed clean so many questions immediately come up to

635
00:35:03,808 --> 00:35:07,392
Do whatever seems to say hi there are you on drugs

636
00:35:07,904 --> 00:35:14,048
Are you lying are you

637
00:35:14,304 --> 00:35:19,680
Hey Alex I'm the devil

638
00:35:21,216 --> 00:35:21,984
But like I said

639
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:25,056
Alex can say all day long that he's not on drugs

640
00:35:25,312 --> 00:35:26,336
But I don't know that he's pissed

641
00:35:26,592 --> 00:35:27,104
Queen

642
00:35:28,128 --> 00:35:28,640
That one time

643
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:30,688
Madison Security

644
00:35:31,968 --> 00:35:32,992
Years ago he Gosa

645
00:35:34,784 --> 00:35:36,576
This man you were totally down tired

646
00:35:36,832 --> 00:35:37,856
Because you just came right back

647
00:35:38,112 --> 00:35:39,904
I'm back on breaking Exploder you on drugs

648
00:35:41,184 --> 00:35:44,000
What do a drug test called a portable drug test here

649
00:35:44,512 --> 00:35:45,024
In a cup

650
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:47,584
No drugs I said you see that he said yeah see that

651
00:35:48,096 --> 00:35:48,864
People think

652
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:49,888
This is weird

653
00:35:52,448 --> 00:35:54,752
When you're under attack

654
00:35:57,312 --> 00:36:00,128
I feel like this sounds like someone on drugs

655
00:36:04,736 --> 00:36:10,880
Your energy switch is just really off-the-charts I was just wondering did you take any drugs in the bathroom

656
00:36:11,136 --> 00:36:17,280
No I didn't say that why are you give me a portable drug test immediately

657
00:36:26,496 --> 00:36:31,616
Savannah protecting is on what I will I will say I'm suspicious

658
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:35,712
So Alex and Ali get to talkin about the six

659
00:36:35,968 --> 00:36:36,480
January 6th

660
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:37,248
The day of the

661
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,040
Storming of the capitol

662
00:36:39,296 --> 00:36:41,088
There's two interesting take

663
00:36:41,344 --> 00:36:47,488
Is here the first is the Alex seems to think that they were right on the cusp of getting that 10-day investigation that Rudy

664
00:36:47,744 --> 00:36:48,512
Giuliani water

665
00:36:48,768 --> 00:36:52,352
So Close All Things Considered

666
00:36:52,864 --> 00:36:54,912
Pretty peaceful rally

667
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,728
Why the hell we have the motive

668
00:36:57,984 --> 00:36:58,752
21 Trump

669
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:03,616
Had them about to do a 10-day investigation we were just showing our numbers why we screw ourselves

670
00:37:03,872 --> 00:37:05,152
Where's the motive

671
00:37:08,224 --> 00:37:08,736
Iran

672
00:37:10,272 --> 00:37:11,040
We still made history

673
00:37:11,296 --> 00:37:12,320
January 6th

674
00:37:12,576 --> 00:37:13,600
What's teaspoon

675
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:14,624
99

676
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:16,928
9% of a million people

677
00:37:17,184 --> 00:37:18,464
Totally peaceful

678
00:37:18,976 --> 00:37:21,280
We feel that our election

679
00:37:21,536 --> 00:37:22,048
Installing

680
00:37:22,304 --> 00:37:23,072
The first

681
00:37:23,328 --> 00:37:24,608
Human history

682
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:29,728
Okay wow that is a big cell that's a big cell

683
00:37:29,984 --> 00:37:32,288
That is an interesting angle Ali Sid

684
00:37:32,544 --> 00:37:35,360
I'll tell you this right now real estate

685
00:37:35,616 --> 00:37:36,384
10 years

686
00:37:36,896 --> 00:37:39,712
Nagasaki is going to be huge that's all I'm saying

687
00:37:39,968 --> 00:37:42,272
I'm saying people aren't thinking about the good

688
00:37:42,528 --> 00:37:44,064
Things that happened on the 6th

689
00:37:45,856 --> 00:37:49,696
Interesting prism to see things through

690
00:37:50,208 --> 00:37:53,024
And I do like Alex's attempted making it like

691
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:57,120
We were right there we were about to get those key rings that you wanted

692
00:37:57,376 --> 00:37:57,888
Because that's

693
00:37:58,144 --> 00:38:00,704
That's a good way to to really make it like

694
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:07,104
We couldn't have possibly wanted anything like this to happen if you were about to get our way

695
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:09,152
That's what we were

696
00:38:09,408 --> 00:38:10,688
So there's a new narrative

697
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,736
It's going to be spun about the sexual

698
00:38:12,992 --> 00:38:14,528
Has to do with

699
00:38:14,784 --> 00:38:15,296
Somebody

700
00:38:16,064 --> 00:38:17,344
An Insider in the trumpet

701
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:18,112
Campaign

702
00:38:18,368 --> 00:38:20,416
That it set them up they did them dirty

703
00:38:20,672 --> 00:38:21,184
Course

704
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:24,768
They got done dirty course they did so what ended up happening

705
00:38:25,024 --> 00:38:26,304
Something like this Rogers

706
00:38:26,816 --> 00:38:28,608
Not entirely clear

707
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:29,888
Somebody

708
00:38:30,144 --> 00:38:36,288
Play a video with Allie wanted them to play at the ellipse

709
00:38:36,544 --> 00:38:39,104
Ali sobh some instruction

710
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:43,712
Something I don't know

711
00:38:44,736 --> 00:38:45,248
Laundromat

712
00:38:45,504 --> 00:38:48,832
He was on safe flight 93

713
00:38:50,112 --> 00:38:51,392
He's just concerned that they didn't

714
00:38:51,648 --> 00:38:56,768
Play the saddest video so people could know not to break again

715
00:38:57,024 --> 00:38:57,536
Play it's a good video

716
00:38:57,792 --> 00:39:01,376
And we walked right into a trap truck watch Regular trips to go into what you know

717
00:39:01,632 --> 00:39:02,656
Are you ready to release her name

718
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:06,752
Maybe she didn't mean it maybe should have BB know it was a command of everything

719
00:39:07,008 --> 00:39:09,056
We know who remove the Jumbotron directives

720
00:39:09,312 --> 00:39:12,640
We know who I mean I mean you're a million people with no Direction

721
00:39:14,688 --> 00:39:19,040
So we got that the person has taken the Jumbotron directions down

722
00:39:19,296 --> 00:39:20,064
Don Alex

723
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,344
Denali dirty

724
00:39:21,856 --> 00:39:26,720
You're like a guess on who this is you know what you're up to email

725
00:39:26,976 --> 00:39:28,256
Okay

726
00:39:30,816 --> 00:39:34,912
Sarah Huckabee Sanders Huckabee Sanders is incorrect

727
00:39:35,936 --> 00:39:38,752
Are you going to release which already thought already told my people

728
00:39:39,264 --> 00:39:40,800
3 weeks ago

729
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:47,200
Yeah I mean I managed to say it to Trina Pearson is a campaign advisor

730
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:49,248
A quarter million dollars

731
00:39:49,504 --> 00:39:50,784
On the Trump campaign

732
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:54,624
Advisors to do nothing

733
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:57,440
The president in November we caught her recalled her out

734
00:39:57,696 --> 00:39:59,488
Me and several members. Bastille

735
00:39:59,744 --> 00:40:01,280
And she was behind this to

736
00:40:01,536 --> 00:40:03,072
Ditch out part of the

737
00:40:03,328 --> 00:40:04,608
The Coalition at the Olympics

738
00:40:04,864 --> 00:40:05,376
And that

739
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,168
Leadership

740
00:40:07,424 --> 00:40:09,984
What the mass is when we walk into a trap set to us

741
00:40:12,288 --> 00:40:12,800
And I think that's

742
00:40:13,056 --> 00:40:13,568
The president

743
00:40:13,824 --> 00:40:15,360
Archer totally distance himself

744
00:40:17,152 --> 00:40:19,200
This is getting a little bit

745
00:40:19,456 --> 00:40:19,968
Too much

746
00:40:20,224 --> 00:40:23,808
Little little

747
00:40:24,064 --> 00:40:24,832
It's a little thin

748
00:40:25,088 --> 00:40:25,600
Guys

749
00:40:25,856 --> 00:40:26,880
Okay

750
00:40:27,392 --> 00:40:30,720
I am just going to have to stick with the simplest

751
00:40:30,976 --> 00:40:32,768
Explanation which is that this

752
00:40:33,024 --> 00:40:34,560
This is what you've been

753
00:40:34,816 --> 00:40:36,096
Telling people to do

754
00:40:36,352 --> 00:40:37,376
Then when they did it

755
00:40:37,632 --> 00:40:38,400
You were mad

756
00:40:38,656 --> 00:40:39,168
Because

757
00:40:39,424 --> 00:40:40,448
It looks real stupid now

758
00:40:40,704 --> 00:40:44,032
Now yes yes and it's pretty easy to look at your rhetoric in

759
00:40:44,288 --> 00:40:45,568
Contentedly

760
00:40:45,824 --> 00:40:47,616
Conspiracy theories that were being thrown around

761
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:51,456
Kind of got a stop the certification of the election

762
00:40:52,736 --> 00:40:54,272
No matter how and

763
00:40:54,528 --> 00:40:59,136
So wait, let me ask you a quick question telling me that

764
00:40:59,392 --> 00:41:05,536
Getting your video up on the Jumbotron that would have saved everything would have Influence People what you're saying to me

765
00:41:06,048 --> 00:41:08,096
Broadcasting somebody's words

766
00:41:08,352 --> 00:41:09,632
Can cause real life

767
00:41:10,912 --> 00:41:16,800
To happen correct

768
00:41:17,056 --> 00:41:19,616
Suggest that you guys are aware that

769
00:41:20,384 --> 00:41:21,152
Well yeah

770
00:41:21,664 --> 00:41:22,176
I think

771
00:41:22,944 --> 00:41:24,224
I think this is just dumb

772
00:41:24,992 --> 00:41:25,504
Like you just

773
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:29,088
It's too far it's too far to walk like to make this make sense

774
00:41:29,856 --> 00:41:32,928
So we now come to the end of our content

775
00:41:33,184 --> 00:41:34,464
And we just have a few more commercial

776
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:36,256
Lovett bring us home

777
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:40,608
Just as the beginning cover commercial

778
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:41,632
I just

779
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:42,912
Can't

780
00:41:43,424 --> 00:41:44,704
This isn't how you started commercial

781
00:41:45,728 --> 00:41:46,240
Look

782
00:41:46,752 --> 00:41:48,544
We got to come along way

783
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:51,360
What

784
00:41:56,223 --> 00:41:56,991
Look

785
00:41:57,503 --> 00:41:58,783
You need paper towels

786
00:42:01,087 --> 00:42:03,647
You look is how you start a fight

787
00:42:06,975 --> 00:42:09,023
You're at a bar if someone's not listening to you

788
00:42:16,447 --> 00:42:18,751
Everybody was pretty good luck

789
00:42:21,567 --> 00:42:24,127
Nope that's how Alex is started reflecting commercial

790
00:42:25,407 --> 00:42:26,175
My pillow

791
00:42:26,431 --> 00:42:31,039
Buy my pillow

792
00:42:31,295 --> 00:42:31,807
Commercial

793
00:42:32,575 --> 00:42:33,087
Look

794
00:42:44,607 --> 00:42:45,119
AB

795
00:42:46,911 --> 00:42:49,215
Populism nationalism approaching the future

796
00:42:49,727 --> 00:42:51,007
Watch repair is a surfer

797
00:42:51,519 --> 00:42:53,311
Whether he is a traitor

798
00:42:53,823 --> 00:42:54,335
Deal

799
00:42:54,591 --> 00:42:56,127
Strongman

800
00:42:57,407 --> 00:42:58,175
Does it really matter

801
00:42:58,687 --> 00:42:59,199
Ocean

802
00:42:59,455 --> 00:43:00,223
Liberty this

803
00:43:00,735 --> 00:43:02,015
System of Freedom these

804
00:43:07,135 --> 00:43:07,647
Was a great man

805
00:43:08,159 --> 00:43:08,927
Dollars

806
00:43:12,767 --> 00:43:13,791
He paid a mighty price

807
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:16,863
4

808
00:43:24,543 --> 00:43:26,847
It's easy to play Monday Morning Quarterback

809
00:43:27,615 --> 00:43:28,639
Taxi driver

810
00:43:36,831 --> 00:43:37,343
Okay

811
00:43:37,855 --> 00:43:38,879
So

812
00:43:41,439 --> 00:43:45,791
He Rambles a bit more and then he makes this metaphor that I think is a little strange

813
00:43:46,303 --> 00:43:47,327
Give me some good news

814
00:43:49,887 --> 00:43:50,399
Big

815
00:43:50,655 --> 00:43:51,423
Royal Flush hit

816
00:44:00,127 --> 00:44:00,895
You'll get that and every

817
00:44:03,711 --> 00:44:04,735
But as for national

818
00:44:05,247 --> 00:44:06,783
Freedom

819
00:44:08,575 --> 00:44:10,367
Trump have in the election

820
00:44:11,391 --> 00:44:13,695
Call the martial law in all the tearing is a sign

821
00:44:16,767 --> 00:44:18,047
Yeah they stole the election

822
00:44:20,607 --> 00:44:21,887
Yesterday

823
00:44:22,399 --> 00:44:23,423
Because they're weak

824
00:44:23,935 --> 00:44:27,263
I'll get the message needs to be like really stressed hard that like

825
00:44:27,775 --> 00:44:33,919
Tyranny is upon us but that is a good sign for the meat or women

826
00:44:34,175 --> 00:44:35,711
You are dying

827
00:44:35,967 --> 00:44:39,807
No it's going well that's that seems to be just like the through-line

828
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:41,855
But also a royal flush

829
00:44:42,111 --> 00:44:42,623
Aunt BB

830
00:44:42,879 --> 00:44:49,023
Yeah that was a little bit frustrating today that's bad metaphor

831
00:44:49,279 --> 00:44:50,815
And why did he lose

832
00:44:51,071 --> 00:44:53,119
I mean you could probably America

833
00:44:53,375 --> 00:44:53,887
Katai

834
00:44:54,143 --> 00:44:55,679
With the dealer if you get blackjack

835
00:44:56,191 --> 00:44:56,703
But

836
00:44:57,215 --> 00:44:57,727
I mean

837
00:44:58,239 --> 00:44:58,751
Yeah

838
00:44:59,519 --> 00:45:01,567
You still can't lose

839
00:45:03,871 --> 00:45:04,639
Brutally

840
00:45:05,151 --> 00:45:09,759
This was the last commercial that we got in this one is exit I thought this was pretty funny

841
00:45:10,271 --> 00:45:13,855
This might be my favorite although I will say it's pretty tough to top

842
00:45:16,159 --> 00:45:19,487
Are you going to look because Luke has a subjects which is

843
00:45:19,743 --> 00:45:25,887
These assholes always look assholes very similar

844
00:45:26,143 --> 00:45:27,679
Exactly

845
00:45:28,191 --> 00:45:30,495
I'll bet this one is great because it makes no sense

846
00:45:31,007 --> 00:45:32,543
Is very stupid

847
00:45:33,823 --> 00:45:34,847
And it reveals something

848
00:45:35,871 --> 00:45:36,895
We're already on the 2nd

849
00:45:46,623 --> 00:45:47,903
Um contact tracers

850
00:45:48,159 --> 00:45:48,927
Your house

851
00:45:49,439 --> 00:45:50,207
People have their doors

852
00:45:50,463 --> 00:45:50,975
Shakedown

853
00:45:51,231 --> 00:45:52,767
This is all

854
00:45:53,023 --> 00:45:53,535
Trying to

855
00:46:02,751 --> 00:46:04,031
Globalist

856
00:46:11,455 --> 00:46:13,247
But into an age when I call Chad

857
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:15,551
Realcomp

858
00:46:17,343 --> 00:46:18,879
Decision

859
00:46:28,863 --> 00:46:29,631
Being awakened

860
00:46:30,143 --> 00:46:32,191
An awesome new age of

861
00:46:35,263 --> 00:46:35,775
The understanding

862
00:46:36,287 --> 00:46:37,055
Every product

863
00:46:37,311 --> 00:46:38,335
You hear me on-air advert

864
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:40,127
We haven't stopped

865
00:46:42,431 --> 00:46:42,943
Every product

866
00:46:43,711 --> 00:46:46,783
A couple days

867
00:46:47,295 --> 00:46:48,319
What's yours

868
00:46:50,623 --> 00:46:56,767
That second part is the

869
00:46:57,023 --> 00:46:57,791
Smyrna Park

870
00:46:58,303 --> 00:47:04,447
Same Parts just adding Rose Wilder just added it on

871
00:47:04,703 --> 00:47:08,287
Everything in stock at the end of a minute of Ben rambling commentary in the new age but

872
00:47:12,895 --> 00:47:13,919
Pho challenge

873
00:47:14,175 --> 00:47:15,199
But also

874
00:47:15,455 --> 00:47:17,759
I like I like a huge selling point being

875
00:47:18,271 --> 00:47:18,783
Our products

876
00:47:19,295 --> 00:47:19,807
Exist

877
00:47:20,063 --> 00:47:21,599
I can show you where they are

878
00:47:21,855 --> 00:47:24,159
They're here the store in the store room

879
00:47:25,183 --> 00:47:26,463
Yeah I'm pretty amazed

880
00:47:26,719 --> 00:47:32,351
That like I really do think he probably just sat down.

881
00:47:32,607 --> 00:47:34,911
Has to

882
00:47:35,167 --> 00:47:36,447
Together it's 100%

883
00:47:38,239 --> 00:47:38,751
I am

884
00:47:39,775 --> 00:47:41,567
I love I love that he's like

885
00:47:41,823 --> 00:47:42,335
I like

886
00:47:42,591 --> 00:47:44,895
Talking about how we're getting into the new age

887
00:47:45,407 --> 00:47:51,551
Bethany realizes that new age of the same little too much

888
00:47:54,879 --> 00:47:56,159
NuWave

889
00:47:56,671 --> 00:47:57,439
The difference

890
00:47:58,719 --> 00:48:01,535
I do appreciate how either

891
00:48:02,047 --> 00:48:02,815
His audience

892
00:48:03,071 --> 00:48:04,351
Has made it very abundantly

893
00:48:04,607 --> 00:48:05,887
We cleared to have with all of their Quest

894
00:48:06,399 --> 00:48:07,679
They do not understand basic

895
00:48:07,935 --> 00:48:09,215
Sickly anything

896
00:48:09,471 --> 00:48:09,983
He

897
00:48:10,239 --> 00:48:11,519
Hats to reiterate

898
00:48:11,775 --> 00:48:12,287
Things cons

899
00:48:12,543 --> 00:48:13,311
Silly Tay himself like

900
00:48:13,823 --> 00:48:19,967
People say that they're worried about cuz I said and then

901
00:48:20,735 --> 00:48:22,271
We all get how

902
00:48:22,527 --> 00:48:23,039
The supply chain

903
00:48:23,295 --> 00:48:25,087
Alex I don't know why

904
00:48:25,343 --> 00:48:25,855
Explain

905
00:48:26,367 --> 00:48:27,135
How that works

906
00:48:27,903 --> 00:48:28,415
In-N-Out

907
00:48:28,671 --> 00:48:31,231
It's because I think that he would

908
00:48:31,487 --> 00:48:34,815
He thinks that he's talking about the supply chain supposed to make people

909
00:48:35,071 --> 00:48:36,095
Feel I need

910
00:48:36,351 --> 00:48:42,495
To act now right but I think that he believed that his audience interpreted as there isn't any stuff

911
00:48:42,751 --> 00:48:47,615
Also because he does do a lot of yelling

912
00:48:47,871 --> 00:48:48,895
Cooper is it like

913
00:48:49,151 --> 00:48:55,295
Yeah so I would understand why the audience might get that impression need to clarify

914
00:48:55,551 --> 00:48:57,087
It seems like

915
00:48:57,343 --> 00:48:59,391
You may pour choices if you've gotten to that

916
00:49:00,159 --> 00:49:00,671
That's what I would

917
00:49:02,719 --> 00:49:03,743
Explain why he starts

918
00:49:03,999 --> 00:49:04,511
Commercials with

919
00:49:08,095 --> 00:49:10,655
But I tell you you can't

920
00:49:13,983 --> 00:49:16,799
Was it not the most serious episode we've ever done

921
00:49:17,311 --> 00:49:21,919
We have paper towels in stores

922
00:49:22,175 --> 00:49:23,711
Piranha man

923
00:49:27,551 --> 00:49:31,391
It's always Super Bowl commercial special

924
00:49:31,647 --> 00:49:36,511
Wednesday to discuss Alex's immediate response

925
00:49:36,767 --> 00:49:39,839
To the impeachment trial and see what he's up to

926
00:49:40,095 --> 00:49:41,887
Damn right to the occasion come up with something

927
00:49:42,143 --> 00:49:42,655
We'll see

928
00:49:42,911 --> 00:49:49,055
But until then Jordan we have website

929
00:49:49,311 --> 00:49:54,943
Barro's on Facebook if you could please find a local charity

930
00:49:55,711 --> 00:49:56,223
Doing God's work

931
00:49:56,479 --> 00:49:58,783
