1
00:00:15,104 --> 00:00:21,248
Damn important

2
00:00:21,504 --> 00:00:27,648
I have great respect for knowledge right now as I'm sick of them posing as you're through the good guy

3
00:00:34,304 --> 00:00:40,448
MoneyGram

4
00:00:53,248 --> 00:00:56,064
Knowledge fight

00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:10,400
Whatsyourprice

10
00:01:17,056 --> 00:01:17,824
Office chair

11
00:01:18,336 --> 00:01:22,432
The old ones that we had were little bit rickety but you were so kind as to provide us

12
00:01:22,944 --> 00:01:24,224
New chairs Jordans

13
00:01:24,736 --> 00:01:29,088

00:01:29,344 --> 00:01:32,416
Navigate to lower back more important

15
00:01:33,184 --> 00:01:37,024
A sentence for someone who spends as much time as any office

16
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,048
This worker does

17
00:01:38,304 --> 00:01:39,328
On a on a chair

Yeah

24
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:59,040
I didn't really recognize how little support the other chairs had until I sat down in this one but if you want we had before

25
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:01,088
Actual

26
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:05,952
What does ergonomic mean

27
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:08,512

Very very

32
00:02:19,008 --> 00:02:20,032
We all know that

33
00:02:20,288 --> 00:02:21,824
Beautiful you've already

34
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,360
Beautiful watch

35
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:30,016
Another thing everybody knows about I don't know about the

36
00:02:30,272 --> 00:02:36,416
Samurai sets

37
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:37,952
During the Mongol invasion

38
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:41,024
Japan on the island of tsushima

39
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,608
And it's basically like a fall of

40
00:02:44,864 --> 00:02:47,168
The Bushido code in the face of all this

41
00:02:47,424 --> 00:02:48,192
It's

42
00:02:48,448 --> 00:02:49,984
So lovingly rendered

43
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:52,032
Japanese island

44
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:53,824
Gorgeous

45
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:59,968
Open world situation

46
00:03:00,224 --> 00:03:06,368
Love it you took my recommendation

47
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:07,392
Indeed

48
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:11,744
Jordan today we have an episode 2

49
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,280
What we got in front of us

50
00:03:14,816 --> 00:03:18,144
Is a companion piece to our Monday episode

51
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:23,264
On Monday we went over The Tragically flawed

52
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,544
Documentary

53
00:03:25,056 --> 00:03:27,616
Millie Weaver arrested

54
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:29,152
Dangerous

55
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:30,432
And arrested

56
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:31,200
Offense of

57
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:35,296
No I don't

58
00:03:35,552 --> 00:03:36,320
I would say the most

59
00:03:36,576 --> 00:03:42,720
People who got thrown at the Republic figures

60
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:44,000
Standard of actual malice

61
00:03:44,256 --> 00:03:46,048
I mean it was so bad it's an arrestable

62
00:03:46,304 --> 00:03:51,936
We discussed music rhyme against

63
00:03:53,472 --> 00:03:58,080
Apologize for the listeners that it was that long

64
00:04:04,224 --> 00:04:09,856
We we did that for Monday and it doing so we had to leave aside The Alex Jones

65
00:04:10,112 --> 00:04:10,624
End

66
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:13,440
Infowars

67
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:22,399
We'll get to that in a little bit

68
00:04:22,655 --> 00:04:23,679
She thought this

69
00:04:23,935 --> 00:04:27,519
We will see over the course of what makes a

70
00:04:27,775 --> 00:04:29,055
Very serious

71
00:04:43,135 --> 00:04:45,183
It's important to

72
00:04:45,695 --> 00:04:49,535
Let's see how Alex response to something

73
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:51,839
A close associate of his who's worked

74
00:04:52,863 --> 00:04:53,887
Hi I don't know

75
00:04:54,399 --> 00:05:00,543
Technically or not for years for them forever and she got arrested

76
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:01,311
Before

77
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:03,359
A reason

78
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:05,919
In the midst of that she is put out

79
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:08,735
Documentary

80
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:15,391
Quotes

81
00:05:16,927 --> 00:05:18,463
He is caught on his

82
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:21,023
F****** back foot

83
00:05:21,279 --> 00:05:22,303
It's this

84
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:25,119
Because he has to

85
00:05:25,631 --> 00:05:27,423
He has a couple of choices one

86
00:05:27,679 --> 00:05:30,495
He can go all in on the conspiracy

87
00:05:30,751 --> 00:05:32,799
Not having to understand

88
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:39,199
Howard one option

89
00:05:41,247 --> 00:05:47,391

Okay

109
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:34,399
An aqueduct

110
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:37,727
System through a medieval town

111
00:07:37,983 --> 00:07:41,055
Yes

112
00:07:42,591 --> 00:07:44,127
Generosity

113
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,175

116
00:07:57,183 --> 00:07:58,975

Instead of note North Dakota

121
00:08:15,103 --> 00:08:15,615
Anyway

122
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:21,503
Episode

123
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:27,903
Chunky peanut butter

124
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:34,303
Spell other stores

125
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:36,607
The bad guy

126
00:08:37,119 --> 00:08:38,655
We got a note here

127
00:08:38,911 --> 00:08:39,679
I thought Jordan

128
00:08:39,935 --> 00:08:40,447
In parentheses

129
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:43,263
Butters

130
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:46,847
I eat the light blue pack it all the time just vanilla almond butter

131
00:08:47,103 --> 00:08:48,639
Only sweetened with Bates

132
00:08:48,895 --> 00:08:49,919
Alright

133
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:52,479
And now

134
00:08:52,735 --> 00:08:53,247
You must

135
00:08:53,503 --> 00:08:54,015
Try

136
00:08:54,271 --> 00:08:58,367
It will be.

137
00:08:58,623 --> 00:09:01,183
We will see if you can put your

138
00:09:01,439 --> 00:09:02,975
Let's see if you made this up to

139
00:09:03,231 --> 00:09:05,279
Keep me quiet for the rest of the show as I like

140
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:07,583
This is

141
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:14,495
This good peanut butter is in the audio field I know that you can give to

142
00:09:14,751 --> 00:09:15,519
Disgusting on a mic

143
00:09:15,775 --> 00:09:19,359
But the only thing grocer is probably the idea of someone eating peanut butter

144
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:24,991
It's not like trying to get a horse to talk sets

145
00:09:27,807 --> 00:09:28,831
No

146
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:33,695
I'll get you a paper towel

147
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:40,863
What you want me to say

148
00:09:41,375 --> 00:09:42,655
What's all this

149
00:09:42,911 --> 00:09:49,055
All this stuff running it doesn't terrible afternoon mix it up well enough

150
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:54,943
I didn't mix it up well I suppose that's probably that's why I

151
00:09:55,199 --> 00:10:01,343
Look I'm not saying I'm blameless in the execution of immediate response to it was either right

152
00:10:01,599 --> 00:10:03,391
You might like almond but I think you're being unfair

153
00:10:04,671 --> 00:10:05,439
You've got a

154
00:10:05,695 --> 00:10:08,511
Euro-Pro peanut bias and I don't approve

155
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:10,303

156
00:10:11,071 --> 00:10:13,631

People

159
00:10:16,447 --> 00:10:22,079
We have some phone calls but those the end of the episode I decided we should move phone calls

160
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:24,895
The end of episode so as to not make a ridiculously long

161
00:10:25,151 --> 00:10:27,199
Open Arrow

162
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:30,783

Playing the later

That he heard that Millie got arrested before the show started

183
00:11:28,895 --> 00:11:30,943
So the show's starting like this seems really weird

184
00:11:31,199 --> 00:11:35,295

00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:33,151
Text ruhi decided

195
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:39,551
I don't care how to whistle along with Andy Griffith gives no indication that he is aware of

196
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:42,623
Millie's arrest until a little ways into the episode

197
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:45,695
So I don't actually think that he heard before the show

198
00:12:45,951 --> 00:12:47,999
I don't remember exactly the

199
00:12:48,255 --> 00:12:49,535
Time of her arrest

200
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:55,167
Or if you would like it's even possible if you knew before but he will say later on that he heard before

201
00:12:55,423 --> 00:12:56,191
Retrospect

202
00:12:56,447 --> 00:13:02,591
So I don't care about whether or not it could be true I just think it's funny to

203
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:03,359
Imagine that like

204
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:05,919
Right before getting on air he finds out that one of his

205
00:13:06,175 --> 00:13:07,711
Quote-unquote employees maybe not

206
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:09,503
I got arrested in India

207
00:13:10,015 --> 00:13:12,319
Oh she's in jail

208
00:13:13,343 --> 00:13:19,231
Remember, pile like I was funny

209
00:13:20,511 --> 00:13:23,839
So it's just a normal ass Alex show on Friday on the 14th

210
00:13:24,095 --> 00:13:29,215
At the beginning and so like users yelling about black lives matter and what have you

211
00:13:29,727 --> 00:13:31,263
Because their empathy has been taken out

212
00:13:33,823 --> 00:13:35,103
Blacklivesmatter

213
00:13:35,359 --> 00:13:37,407
Attacking emergency Children Hospital

214
00:13:37,663 --> 00:13:39,199
Little kids are inside

215
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:43,551
Give us your money your house

216
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:44,575
How did everything

217
00:13:44,831 --> 00:13:46,623
We're here we support crime

218
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:53,023
Good questions there's no bottom to it

219
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:55,327
Is that what

220
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:57,375
Zombie like Monsters

221
00:13:57,631 --> 00:14:01,983
Zombie like Monsters you around your house and take it

222
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:04,799
I really am surprised

223
00:14:06,335 --> 00:14:09,663
I almost missed you in the documentary because I forgot

224
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:10,943
Like that's

225
00:14:11,711 --> 00:14:13,759
Terribly racist towards black lives matter

226
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:20,159
But at least they're not like spinning Yarns about how black people are going to break into your home and steal your shoes

227
00:14:20,415 --> 00:14:22,719
And then slap them on your face you know sure sure

228
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:25,535
Is this is still more intense

229
00:14:25,791 --> 00:14:31,935
Yeah much on this episode because

230
00:14:32,191 --> 00:14:35,519
Does mostly get into like Millie related stuff

231
00:14:36,031 --> 00:14:37,055
And other

232
00:14:37,311 --> 00:14:43,199
Sundry issues but I just wanted to put that into remind

233
00:14:43,455 --> 00:14:45,759
Until he clearly learned

234
00:14:46,015 --> 00:14:48,319
Like half an hour into the show that got arrested

235
00:14:48,575 --> 00:14:51,903
It's just a normal show he's just going through the motions as normal

236
00:14:52,415 --> 00:14:52,927
And then

237
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:54,975
He finds out the Millie's been arrested

238
00:14:55,487 --> 00:14:58,303
And it's very clear that out of the gate he wants

239
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:00,095
Use this for promotion

240
00:15:00,351 --> 00:15:03,679
Okay so Millie Weaver and her husband Gavin

241
00:15:11,615 --> 00:15:12,895
People affiliated with

242
00:15:14,175 --> 00:15:14,943
Bumps in the White House

243
00:15:15,711 --> 00:15:16,479
Kill your name

244
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:21,343
Interviewed former military officers

245
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:23,647
Whistleblowers

246
00:15:26,719 --> 00:15:27,231
Individuals

247
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:30,303
And they were making us independent film

248
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:32,095
Titled

249
00:15:34,911 --> 00:15:35,423
Shadowgate

250
00:15:36,191 --> 00:15:39,007
Imma pull the trailer up

251
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:43,103
They were scheduled to come on yesterday

252
00:15:44,127 --> 00:15:44,639
B

253
00:15:45,663 --> 00:15:47,199
Millie said they were getting solid

254
00:15:47,455 --> 00:15:49,759
The phone

255
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:51,551
Taking off their computers

256
00:15:53,343 --> 00:15:54,623
Well they just got SWAT team

257
00:15:56,671 --> 00:15:58,463
We saw the video trailer is

258
00:15:58,719 --> 00:16:02,303
Upon

259
00:16:02,559 --> 00:16:04,863
See the video of her being arrested

260
00:16:07,423 --> 00:16:11,007
This is not Andy Griffith

261
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:21,503
Alex Alex

262
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:28,671
You've reported this site unseen Milly got SWAT team

263
00:16:28,927 --> 00:16:31,231
Come on yesterday

264
00:16:31,487 --> 00:16:37,375
It's important to keep the timeline straight immediately Alex the saying yesterday she was supposed to be on

265
00:16:37,631 --> 00:16:39,167
Now on Friday

266
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:39,935
Not on

267
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:40,703
Arrested

268
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:42,495
In Ohio

269
00:16:42,751 --> 00:16:44,287
I don't have it on yesterday

270
00:16:44,799 --> 00:16:45,567
Do the jet-setter

271
00:16:47,103 --> 00:16:52,479
This is the first point where Alex tries to cover his ass

272
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:53,759
She doesn't work here

273
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:55,807
So Millie and

274
00:17:01,183 --> 00:17:05,279
Banana said she can't tell you what all this is real reason emails are

275
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:09,375
They're trying to rest her right now

276
00:17:13,983 --> 00:17:15,263
We're not up for telling the other way.

277
00:17:21,663 --> 00:17:22,431
Contact

278
00:17:25,247 --> 00:17:25,759
Tear

279
00:17:26,271 --> 00:17:28,319
This is Extreme dress

280
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:31,391
I don't want to see any of these.

281
00:17:31,903 --> 00:17:33,183
Already know all this

282
00:17:33,439 --> 00:17:37,791
Turn off

283
00:17:38,047 --> 00:17:39,327
Know this stuff

284
00:17:40,863 --> 00:17:42,399
No as a jerk

285
00:17:42,655 --> 00:17:44,191
I don't want to see

286
00:17:47,263 --> 00:17:53,407
I need blokable tonight abilities I will get rid of entirely by announcing that I knew

287
00:17:54,431 --> 00:17:55,967
You do not work here

288
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:06,975
Any leads me to believe that Alex thinks that you might be mixed up in something like Alex might think that she's probably

289
00:18:07,231 --> 00:18:11,071
You dealing with some shady Trucking characters

290
00:18:11,327 --> 00:18:17,471
This is a situation all over again I don't I don't know what he's imagining

291
00:18:17,727 --> 00:18:19,775
Other that

292
00:18:20,031 --> 00:18:25,919
Have you seen the documentary you know that there's no reason to worry

293
00:18:26,175 --> 00:18:28,991
But

294
00:18:29,759 --> 00:18:30,527
I mean Trump

295
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:32,319
Needs to get involved

296
00:18:33,343 --> 00:18:37,951
These two have got a f****** bill Barr

297
00:18:38,207 --> 00:18:40,255
Hardin Valley league.org

298
00:18:40,511 --> 00:18:43,839
What is that Susan B Anthony pardon was actually

299
00:18:45,887 --> 00:18:48,191
Parentheses

300
00:18:48,447 --> 00:18:50,239
Rainbow snatch

301
00:18:52,031 --> 00:18:52,799
Please get involved

302
00:18:53,055 --> 00:18:54,079
I think companies

303
00:18:54,335 --> 00:18:55,359
Immediately

304
00:19:03,807 --> 00:19:05,855
These are real people interviewed

305
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:12,255
And because of the way things are going I guess these folks told them so big safe

306
00:19:19,423 --> 00:19:20,447
Believe me

307
00:19:24,031 --> 00:19:26,335
Defense intelligence people there I mean

308
00:19:26,591 --> 00:19:28,639
This is not this is a serious

309
00:19:28,895 --> 00:19:30,175
Millie didn't get

310
00:19:30,431 --> 00:19:34,015
Bucking Mike Flynn Jr to come to that Z-Pak

311
00:19:34,271 --> 00:19:40,415
She's a social engineering know I brought Michael Flynn Jr

312
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:46,815
That's because Millie Weaver first social engineer The Minnow

313
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:47,583
Glenn Jr

314
00:19:47,839 --> 00:19:52,191
No Ivan reichlin it been on Alex's show before the past

315
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:54,751
Flynn defense fund fundraiser stuff

316
00:19:55,007 --> 00:19:59,871
Sure and he brought Michael Flynn Jr and you

317
00:20:00,127 --> 00:20:02,687
And Alex did announce entirely what happened

318
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:04,991
And then Alex almost

319
00:20:05,247 --> 00:20:05,759
Cried

320
00:20:06,015 --> 00:20:08,575
While Michael Flynn Jr stood by

321
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:14,975
Very uncomfortably beautiful your dad was going to put the military-backed government

322
00:20:15,231 --> 00:20:17,791
I hate that you're twisting

323
00:20:18,303 --> 00:20:22,399
Todrick drunk before his head lyrics

324
00:20:24,447 --> 00:20:30,591
Aren't the square Rob do had to close up

325
00:20:31,103 --> 00:20:33,407
I tried to take the rain in the morning

326
00:20:34,175 --> 00:20:37,247
Yeah it was not as full of

327
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:38,271
Defense intelligence

328
00:20:38,527 --> 00:20:39,807
As much as Alex mites

329
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:41,343
Pretending

330
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:46,463
Elearn

331
00:20:47,743 --> 00:20:50,047
Where's my shoe I have one shoe here

332
00:20:54,399 --> 00:20:56,959
Wait to know nuts are bad apparently

333
00:20:57,471 --> 00:20:59,775
Yet to get to mention Brianna Taylor at all but

334
00:21:00,287 --> 00:21:06,175
Good to know that you reported that you got SWAT team based on

335
00:21:06,687 --> 00:21:10,015
0 hearsay someone saying that

336
00:21:10,271 --> 00:21:10,783
True

337
00:21:11,295 --> 00:21:12,319
Good journalist against

338
00:21:13,599 --> 00:21:18,976
So Alex goes back to the journalistic instinct

339
00:21:19,488 --> 00:21:21,536
Probably because she had Hillary's email

340
00:21:21,792 --> 00:21:23,584
I don't understand what's happening right now

341
00:21:26,144 --> 00:21:28,448
All right so they're they're saying it's stolen.

342
00:21:32,288 --> 00:21:33,824
Females all of it so

343
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,616
Reported

344
00:21:37,152 --> 00:21:38,688
And the dust Apartments all scared

345
00:21:38,944 --> 00:21:40,224
Reportedly it's

346
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:42,528
Emails

347
00:21:46,368 --> 00:21:48,672
I think the only person reported

348
00:21:50,208 --> 00:21:50,720
Yep

349
00:21:51,232 --> 00:21:54,816
So as it turns out the issue

350
00:21:55,072 --> 00:21:56,608
Now we know because the

351
00:21:56,864 --> 00:21:58,912
The arrest indictment

352
00:21:59,424 --> 00:22:02,496
I've come out with the family squabble

353
00:22:03,008 --> 00:22:06,080
Lily and her mother

354
00:22:06,336 --> 00:22:09,152
Who is coming to visit I have the article here

355
00:22:09,408 --> 00:22:11,968
From cleveland.com

356
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:15,808
And I'll just read out the

357
00:22:16,064 --> 00:22:17,600
The main thing

358
00:22:18,112 --> 00:22:19,648
Here is

359
00:22:19,904 --> 00:22:23,488
Their mom

360
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:25,280
Came from California to stay with the

361
00:22:25,536 --> 00:22:30,656
Has Gail Road home earlier this year after North Hollywood

362
00:22:30,912 --> 00:22:31,936
Due to the Coronavirus

363
00:22:32,448 --> 00:22:37,824
McCarran told deputies that Millie Weaver was swearing at her being mean and calling her names on April 25th

364
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:42,432
And she was texting with a bishop at the Mormon church where she attended about it the report says

365
00:22:43,456 --> 00:22:46,784
McCarron said she decided to record the behavior on her cell phone

366
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:51,136
And placed it in the back pocket of her jeans while she made a grilled cheese sandwich

367
00:22:51,904 --> 00:22:55,232
Millie Weaver sat at the bar Charles Weaver that Millie's brother

368
00:22:55,488 --> 00:22:58,304
Wash the dishes and wheat stood nearby their ports

369
00:22:59,328 --> 00:23:01,376
The trio began picking on her including talk

370
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:04,960
Generally being me McCarran told deputies

371
00:23:05,728 --> 00:23:07,520
Someone noticed the phone in their pocket

372
00:23:07,776 --> 00:23:08,800
Suggested that you was recorded

373
00:23:09,056 --> 00:23:09,568
The report says

374
00:23:13,152 --> 00:23:16,480
McCarran says Winstrol Charles Weaver to grab her

375
00:23:18,784 --> 00:23:19,296
Macaron set

376
00:23:19,552 --> 00:23:24,160
Millie Weaver joined in and all three wrestled to the ground

377
00:23:24,672 --> 00:23:26,208
McCarron said according through Park

378
00:23:26,464 --> 00:23:29,536
McCarron said she tried to kick and punch them while they were on her

379
00:23:30,304 --> 00:23:33,120
Cell phone fell out of her pocket

380
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:37,728
She ran to a neighbor's house

381
00:23:37,984 --> 00:23:39,008
Dial 911

382
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:45,152
The report says

383
00:23:45,408 --> 00:23:48,992
And returned almost immediately as McCarron was on the phone with deputies

384
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:52,576
McCann suspect Riverside was trying to get rid of her cell phone

385
00:23:53,856 --> 00:23:58,720
Okay so he's he's at a traffic stop throwing

386
00:24:04,352 --> 00:24:06,400
Alright

387
00:24:06,656 --> 00:24:07,424
It's a

388
00:24:09,472 --> 00:24:15,616
Her brother and

389
00:24:16,896 --> 00:24:17,920
And they all gave

390
00:24:18,176 --> 00:24:18,944
Different

391
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:22,016
Accounts of what happened now that's because their master

392
00:24:22,272 --> 00:24:28,416
There was a bunch of contradictions like milia told the deputies that her mother had lost the cell phone

393
00:24:28,928 --> 00:24:32,512
Nonsense like there's no

394
00:24:32,768 --> 00:24:35,072
Parents to any of their stories

395
00:24:36,352 --> 00:24:37,376
Surprising I really thought

396
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:42,240
These people would just really be a no

397
00:24:43,264 --> 00:24:48,384
And if you read this article it also mentions that the bishop at the church

398
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,944
They took her mother was apparently texting with

399
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:51,712
Confirm

400
00:24:51,968 --> 00:24:53,248
The stories

401
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:54,528
The correspondents

402
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:58,624
About this many of the details

403
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:05,024
That McCarron had realized that the report says husband and her brother all

404
00:25:06,048 --> 00:25:12,192
I mean we knew that before probably before but now now we know that

405
00:25:12,448 --> 00:25:17,056
Apparently that explains the burglar

406
00:25:21,408 --> 00:25:23,456
Messing with evidence

407
00:25:23,712 --> 00:25:25,504
Steps to getting rid of the phone

408
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:32,416
Your mother's all the charges make sense

409
00:25:32,672 --> 00:25:34,976
Cuz of the stolen document

410
00:25:35,232 --> 00:25:41,376
Right I mean that's probably

411
00:25:42,144 --> 00:25:44,960
Yeah so after that if it is the investigation parently

412
00:25:45,216 --> 00:25:50,080
The case was referred to the County prosecutor's office and eventually presented to a grand jury

413
00:25:50,336 --> 00:25:51,360
Made its way through

414
00:25:51,872 --> 00:25:53,408
I'm at now

415
00:25:53,664 --> 00:25:54,432
Warren deserve

416
00:25:55,968 --> 00:25:58,272
I mean look I think this all makes total sense

417
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:04,928
I don't know I don't have any reason to believe that there's anything fishy going on here other than

418
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:08,768
Yeah maybe some unfortunate family Dynamics and some people be in

419
00:26:09,024 --> 00:26:10,048
Pretty Adeline

420
00:26:11,328 --> 00:26:12,864
We'll see we'll see what happens

421
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:13,888
Things with the

422
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:14,912
Further

423
00:26:15,168 --> 00:26:16,960
Information

424
00:26:17,472 --> 00:26:21,568
I mean based on having watched the documentary having looked into all that stuff

425
00:26:22,848 --> 00:26:23,360
I just

426
00:26:23,616 --> 00:26:29,760
Millie Weaver

427
00:26:30,016 --> 00:26:32,320
You probably

428
00:26:32,576 --> 00:26:35,136
Mother who called the police on them

429
00:26:35,392 --> 00:26:37,952
She came and talked to her

430
00:26:38,208 --> 00:26:42,304
Maybe she didn't know that there was a warrant for her arrest but I would assume that you would I would

431
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:43,584
Notify

432
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:46,400
I have no idea on that though so I don't know

433
00:26:46,656 --> 00:26:51,776
Anyway Alex at this point as nowhere to turn except the experts in that documentary

434
00:26:52,288 --> 00:26:56,384
So he has Torreon

435
00:26:59,456 --> 00:27:00,992
She's just a cat real

436
00:27:01,504 --> 00:27:03,296
Real soft defense for Millie

437
00:27:03,808 --> 00:27:06,624
Internet connection was extremely slow

438
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:07,904
Very difficult

439
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:12,000
Put it together

440
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:14,304
About to release this what what you think's going on

441
00:27:15,328 --> 00:27:19,936
They know that we don't have possession of Hillary's emails

442
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:24,544
This is just them trying to get information

443
00:27:25,056 --> 00:27:26,080
Burglary come on Alex

444
00:27:26,336 --> 00:27:31,456
Why would one Burger

445
00:27:32,224 --> 00:27:33,504
I asked you to Jordan

446
00:27:36,064 --> 00:27:38,112
Because there was evidence

447
00:27:38,368 --> 00:27:38,880
I don't know

448
00:27:39,136 --> 00:27:44,000
Yeah it's not good okay

449
00:27:44,512 --> 00:27:47,840
I think they might have talked in the past before because

450
00:27:48,096 --> 00:27:49,888
Tori was the source

451
00:27:50,144 --> 00:27:52,192
Spore the story

452
00:27:52,704 --> 00:27:55,264
That was his much more forthright about them

453
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,056
Billy was a documentary

454
00:27:57,312 --> 00:27:57,824
Just weird

455
00:27:58,336 --> 00:28:01,664
But there's something really strange going on

456
00:28:02,176 --> 00:28:02,944
And that is

457
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,248
The David Millie is arrested

458
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,296
It may end up releasing

459
00:28:07,552 --> 00:28:08,064
The video

460
00:28:09,088 --> 00:28:10,112
Patrick Bergin

461
00:28:10,368 --> 00:28:13,952
The other expert from that documentary he's in Austin

462
00:28:14,976 --> 00:28:16,768
This is very weird is weird

463
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,168
A Milli

464
00:28:25,216 --> 00:28:27,264
A lot of crazy stuff going on

465
00:28:27,776 --> 00:28:33,920
Patrick was in Austin the day before Alex's Milly was going to come on the day before

466
00:28:34,432 --> 00:28:37,760
So there seems to be a timeline of something there

467
00:28:38,528 --> 00:28:39,040
It's unclear

468
00:28:42,112 --> 00:28:43,392
Like they were going to tag team

469
00:28:43,648 --> 00:28:44,160
Human somewhere

470
00:28:44,416 --> 00:28:44,928
You know

471
00:28:45,184 --> 00:28:49,792
Yes it's hard sounds like that's the only sounds also like the guy who might

472
00:28:50,048 --> 00:28:52,864
Hopper flights

473
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:56,960
What's really going on

474
00:28:57,216 --> 00:28:59,520
Might be where my brain goes

475
00:29:00,032 --> 00:29:03,104
I think you might be going it's busy for himself a little bit

476
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:09,504
If you have like a number chaotic element

477
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:10,272
And

478
00:29:10,784 --> 00:29:12,064
Like all of them have it

479
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,880
Fibromyalgia of what's going on

480
00:29:15,136 --> 00:29:17,696
And I don't know I don't know who the f*** is doing what

481
00:29:17,952 --> 00:29:24,096
Looks like Millie's tight-knit family none of them have yet Millie is trying to get this.

482
00:29:24,352 --> 00:29:30,496
And unfortunately the timing of it also coincides with her allegedly so

483
00:29:30,752 --> 00:29:31,264
Assaulting her mother

484
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,080
Tori is

485
00:29:34,336 --> 00:29:35,104
Out there

486
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:37,408
She's got some agenda of her up

487
00:29:37,664 --> 00:29:40,992
Patrick burgy is another Rogue actor

488
00:29:41,248 --> 00:29:47,392
Alex is confused but is also the central

489
00:29:47,648 --> 00:29:50,208
Goodbye everybody he doesn't know what's going on

490
00:29:50,464 --> 00:29:52,256
So old.

491
00:29:52,512 --> 00:29:54,048
These planets come from

492
00:29:54,304 --> 00:29:57,376
All four of them have slightly different interest but it

493
00:29:57,632 --> 00:30:00,192
All around the same thing

494
00:30:00,448 --> 00:30:03,776
Really confused I'm not even positive dipatri

495
00:30:04,032 --> 00:30:10,176
We're going to be on the day prior I think it's entirely possible

496
00:30:10,944 --> 00:30:17,088
The burgie came to Austin and wanted to get on Alex's show and Millie was trying to facilitate that

497
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:20,160
Somehow didn't work how the f*** wouldn't it work

498
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:25,024
What is happening on the show

499
00:30:25,536 --> 00:30:27,072
I mean I guess maybe Burgers judge

500
00:30:27,328 --> 00:30:28,352
Just really really annoying

501
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,144
I get that vibe

502
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:36,544
He goes to places where people are

503
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:39,872
150 dollars

504
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:44,992
I told her we had no water but he blocked me on Twitter

505
00:30:47,552 --> 00:30:48,832
Zoe Millie was indeed

506
00:30:49,344 --> 00:30:51,136
Alright

507
00:30:51,392 --> 00:30:52,672
Intelligence operatives

508
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:54,208
You know what I saw

509
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:57,280
Millie Weaver husband working with

510
00:30:57,536 --> 00:30:59,840
And some of the people I was like what

511
00:31:00,864 --> 00:31:01,376
Carpetbagger

512
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:10,336
I don't know what's going on

513
00:31:11,872 --> 00:31:13,920
I was crawling

514
00:31:17,248 --> 00:31:20,320
Will bring my officers

515
00:31:22,368 --> 00:31:23,392
You were f******

516
00:31:23,648 --> 00:31:25,696
Three sheets to the wind

517
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,512
He does actually always credits

518
00:31:28,768 --> 00:31:33,632
Franklin as a green berets

519
00:31:34,656 --> 00:31:36,192
Look I love this angle

520
00:31:36,448 --> 00:31:38,496
This angle of like Millie was indeed

521
00:31:38,752 --> 00:31:40,288
Get into that kind of thing

522
00:31:40,544 --> 00:31:43,616
All I do is report the news as of analysis the news

523
00:31:44,128 --> 00:31:48,224
Smash cut to the hundred thousand times I wasn't like everybody

524
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:50,784
Stateless

525
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:56,160
The best of the best sources deep within the government the good guys and intelligent

526
00:32:01,024 --> 00:32:02,304
Stuff is foia request

527
00:32:06,656 --> 00:32:07,424
With publican

528
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:11,008
All of my foil request or under an assumed name

529
00:32:12,288 --> 00:32:13,056
That's such a

530
00:32:13,824 --> 00:32:14,848
I love when he's

531
00:32:15,104 --> 00:32:17,152
Clearly trying to make up a narrative essay

532
00:32:17,408 --> 00:32:17,920
He's going along

533
00:32:18,432 --> 00:32:19,456
His tone of voice is

534
00:32:19,712 --> 00:32:23,040
Completely different

535
00:32:23,296 --> 00:32:28,416
To commit even about Billy being associated

536
00:32:28,928 --> 00:32:31,232
I fell. I don't know nothing I've never even talked to

537
00:32:32,512 --> 00:32:38,656
This has me on your feeling of that

538
00:32:38,912 --> 00:32:41,216
I don't want

539
00:32:42,496 --> 00:32:46,336
You are. Going to rub this on me

540
00:32:52,224 --> 00:32:55,296
In Austin

541
00:32:55,552 --> 00:32:56,576
Surprise of surprises

542
00:32:56,832 --> 00:33:00,416
You still in Austin

543
00:33:00,672 --> 00:33:02,720
Studio

544
00:33:03,232 --> 00:33:03,744
Dear

545
00:33:12,192 --> 00:33:12,960
Austin show

546
00:33:15,776 --> 00:33:16,800
Not going to post

547
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:18,848
Shadow

548
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:20,896
Gate without watching it

549
00:33:22,176 --> 00:33:24,736
Crime and their perspectives to watch it

550
00:33:25,248 --> 00:33:28,320
But you see we're journalists so that's always been productive

551
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:35,232
Alex is being uncharacteristically cautious

552
00:33:35,488 --> 00:33:39,072
This is Katie this is weird

553
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:41,632
He also seems very confused

554
00:33:41,888 --> 00:33:45,216
Yeah

555
00:33:45,472 --> 00:33:48,800
In the middle of being on air here's what I'm getting here's a vug

556
00:33:50,336 --> 00:33:54,176
Holyshit I'm up what did she actually do something

557
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:58,784
Did she did she do journalism

558
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:00,832
That is kind of the feeling

559
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:06,720
I'm not supposed to deal with reality and Millie is making me deal with it not

560
00:34:07,232 --> 00:34:08,512
Generous

561
00:34:08,768 --> 00:34:10,048
Interpretation

562
00:34:10,304 --> 00:34:11,072
Oh my God

563
00:34:11,328 --> 00:34:11,840
One of these

564
00:34:12,352 --> 00:34:16,192
Like Ding Dongs that works for me accidentally actually got

565
00:34:16,448 --> 00:34:18,240
Secret

566
00:34:18,496 --> 00:34:24,640
Clandestine document oh no I want no part of this

567
00:34:25,152 --> 00:34:30,528
I don't want

568
00:34:30,784 --> 00:34:34,624
That's one possibility another possibility that I considered is that like

569
00:34:35,136 --> 00:34:37,440
Alex do such a bad job of like

570
00:34:37,696 --> 00:34:43,328
Training or getting these people to understand how to do their jobs journalism

571
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:44,352
That like

572
00:34:44,864 --> 00:34:46,656
He might think that she just

573
00:34:46,912 --> 00:34:49,216
Broke into a place or something

574
00:34:49,472 --> 00:34:52,032
I didn't get a secret document right

575
00:34:52,288 --> 00:34:58,432
If she was doing it as an Infowars employee that could reflect poorly on

576
00:34:58,688 --> 00:35:00,224
Obviously

577
00:35:00,736 --> 00:35:01,504
She's a f****** contra

578
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:04,064
Yeah oh yeah

579
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:04,832
Nobody

580
00:35:08,928 --> 00:35:10,976
They take a lot of money for Alex to pay

581
00:35:11,488 --> 00:35:12,000
And

582
00:35:12,512 --> 00:35:13,280
He doesn't plug

583
00:35:13,792 --> 00:35:14,560
There ain't no money coming in

584
00:35:14,816 --> 00:35:16,096
How did blog last hour

585
00:35:17,376 --> 00:35:18,144
Reply yesterday

586
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,168
Almost

587
00:35:19,424 --> 00:35:20,448
We won't be here

588
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:23,008
Insect monster that right I'm not bitching

589
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:30,432
Tell you hey the whole country may not be here if you want vitamins and minerals in high-quality supplements are books or t-shirts

590
00:35:32,992 --> 00:35:36,832
We win this

591
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:50,144
Seems like there's there's two things

592
00:35:50,656 --> 00:35:55,264
I don't understand which is the reality

593
00:35:56,544 --> 00:35:59,616
If Infowars goes down so does the country

594
00:36:00,128 --> 00:36:04,224
And then there's another part I don't care if I get destroyed as long as the country survives

595
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:06,016
And I don't know I don't

596
00:36:06,272 --> 00:36:06,784
I don't know which

597
00:36:07,296 --> 00:36:07,808
Is the

598
00:36:08,064 --> 00:36:09,856
Like what he's actually trying to push

599
00:36:10,112 --> 00:36:11,136
I want money

600
00:36:11,392 --> 00:36:12,160
Yes

601
00:36:12,416 --> 00:36:13,696
That is behind a lot of

602
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:15,232
Amusement

603
00:36:16,256 --> 00:36:17,792
Because he has to pay benefits for these employees

604
00:36:18,048 --> 00:36:20,864
Guanajuato

605
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:22,144
She is knocked

606
00:36:28,544 --> 00:36:30,080
Exactly what you're doing

607
00:36:30,336 --> 00:36:31,872
Your own stuff going on

608
00:36:34,432 --> 00:36:35,456
Sponsor them

609
00:36:35,712 --> 00:36:38,272
If he was proud of this he would be like

610
00:36:38,528 --> 00:36:42,624
Not only is she an employee she is part owner of Mitchell

611
00:36:44,416 --> 00:36:46,720
I'm not just that but he's going all-in on

612
00:36:46,976 --> 00:36:51,584
You need to give us money so I can take care of her bail bonds in Wichita

613
00:36:52,864 --> 00:36:53,888
He's not doing he's not doing

614
00:36:54,144 --> 00:36:57,216
See if he cared about it

615
00:36:57,472 --> 00:37:00,032
He barely is plugging the GoFundMe

616
00:37:00,288 --> 00:37:03,872
I got set up set up

617
00:37:04,128 --> 00:37:05,408
AI GoFundMe for Millie

618
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:07,712
People are not

619
00:37:07,968 --> 00:37:11,040
Not your friend know Alex is not your friend Billy

620
00:37:11,296 --> 00:37:13,600
Alex isn't your friend none of you are friend

621
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:15,136
That's the way I was behaving

622
00:37:15,392 --> 00:37:20,768
Is very much like I want Millie to get out of prison I don't want her to be in prison but also

623
00:37:21,536 --> 00:37:27,168
Anything to look bad for me so in case she did do something I want to be careful

624
00:37:27,424 --> 00:37:33,568
And I just might be a f****** nonsense thing

625
00:37:35,616 --> 00:37:36,128
Buckets

626
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:41,248
Metaphorical gunfire data piece

627
00:37:42,784 --> 00:37:43,808
Alex

628
00:37:45,344 --> 00:37:46,624
Basically is

629
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:51,232
Operating on Friday on the assumption that you got arrested for stealing documents

630
00:37:51,488 --> 00:37:52,000
Pretty much

631
00:37:52,768 --> 00:37:53,792
Where he's at

632
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:04,032
Social Security

633
00:38:04,288 --> 00:38:05,824
Issue here is the trailer

634
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:07,360
Foreshadowed

635
00:38:08,128 --> 00:38:10,176
Obviously a national security issue a

636
00:38:10,432 --> 00:38:16,576
The feds arrest

637
00:38:16,832 --> 00:38:21,696
The feds with the SWAT team conveniently outside

638
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:24,768
So Patrick bergey comes in

639
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:29,632
He has a bit of a version of the story

640
00:38:31,936 --> 00:38:32,448
Complexity

641
00:38:32,704 --> 00:38:33,984
She was talkin

642
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:35,776
Gavin wince

643
00:38:36,032 --> 00:38:36,800
Just before

644
00:38:37,056 --> 00:38:37,568
The arrest

645
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:41,664
He just told me that there was going to be a big interview on Monday

646
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:42,688
By somebody

647
00:38:45,504 --> 00:38:46,016
Wasn't Trump

648
00:38:46,272 --> 00:38:48,320
And somebody was going to ask

649
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:52,160
President Trump about shadowgate on Monday and I said

650
00:38:52,416 --> 00:38:55,232
Until fate flown I said ain't no way in hell someone's going to let

651
00:38:55,488 --> 00:38:56,000
That a

652
00:38:56,256 --> 00:38:56,768
Ben Wright

653
00:38:58,304 --> 00:38:59,840
Minutes of me saying that

654
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:05,984
The police were showing up

655
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:06,752
Gavin's

656
00:39:07,776 --> 00:39:08,544
Milling

657
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,336
Them in the driveway

658
00:39:11,872 --> 00:39:18,016
And she we saw the video right now so I don't know

659
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:22,624
Tell from the clear beginning or endpoint that video is

660
00:39:23,136 --> 00:39:28,256
But I don't care as I can throw him so

661
00:39:28,512 --> 00:39:30,560
Particularly care about this this

662
00:39:31,072 --> 00:39:32,608
There is

663
00:39:34,144 --> 00:39:36,960
Clip is too long to captain on the episode

664
00:39:37,728 --> 00:39:40,032
But Patrick tells Alex that like

665
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:41,312
I was

666
00:39:41,824 --> 00:39:43,872
Cautious about coming on your show

667
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:47,968
That's because your show is called Infowars

668
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:50,272
That's information War

669
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:58,464
Because I'm up against

670
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:01,024
Information Warfare

671
00:40:01,792 --> 00:40:03,072
Are they have like this

672
00:40:04,608 --> 00:40:06,400
Sort of interaction that like

673
00:40:06,912 --> 00:40:10,496
You can tell that there's some Frosty tween them

674
00:40:14,848 --> 00:40:16,640
This guy might believe

675
00:40:16,896 --> 00:40:18,688
In some sort of Internet stuff

676
00:40:18,944 --> 00:40:24,576
Yes harder than Alex and then maybe looks italics

677
00:40:25,344 --> 00:40:25,856
With your imaginary

678
00:40:26,112 --> 00:40:27,136
Bulshit

679
00:40:27,392 --> 00:40:29,952
It is also

680
00:40:30,208 --> 00:40:36,352
Includes a way to dismiss your imaginary motion

681
00:40:36,608 --> 00:40:38,912
Believe that you're engaged in information Warfare

682
00:40:39,168 --> 00:40:43,264
Sure

683
00:40:44,544 --> 00:40:46,592
Yeah it's kind of defensive

684
00:40:47,616 --> 00:40:49,152
But he is also like

685
00:40:49,408 --> 00:40:50,176
Really

686
00:40:50,432 --> 00:40:54,016
Really like the two things that he stressing on this episode

687
00:40:54,272 --> 00:40:55,040
So strongly

688
00:40:55,296 --> 00:40:57,344
Are there

689
00:40:57,600 --> 00:40:59,648
And I don't do secrets yet

690
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:02,208
Meli watch out

691
00:41:03,488 --> 00:41:04,256
That wheel

692
00:41:05,792 --> 00:41:07,328
Wannabe

693
00:41:13,472 --> 00:41:14,240
Gaston

694
00:41:16,288 --> 00:41:17,824
Set us up a bunch

695
00:41:19,104 --> 00:41:20,128
How to do secret stuff

696
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:22,176
I've never done a secret I've never had

697
00:41:22,944 --> 00:41:23,456
Hey

698
00:41:23,712 --> 00:41:25,248
Feel like I've heard him have

699
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:26,784
Top secret source

700
00:41:27,296 --> 00:41:33,440
In every I think he might have a large number of lieutenant colonel's in every branch

701
00:41:36,256 --> 00:41:37,280
I mean I guess everywhere

702
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:38,816
He says it like

703
00:41:39,072 --> 00:41:45,216
The globalists are planning to overthrow the president they're trying to kill everyone

704
00:41:45,472 --> 00:41:51,616
One with a specific date his best friend

705
00:41:53,919 --> 00:41:55,967
He doesn't do secrets

706
00:41:56,991 --> 00:42:02,367
Fredericksburg he's bitter about the various media entities that have snubbed him in the past

707
00:42:02,879 --> 00:42:05,439
And so you can play a little bit about Dan bongino here

708
00:42:05,951 --> 00:42:09,279
And then Alex betrays Dan bongino's confidence on air

709
00:42:11,583 --> 00:42:17,727
Can't trust anybody in the media

710
00:42:18,495 --> 00:42:20,543
They broke in his house yesterday up something will happen

711
00:42:20,799 --> 00:42:23,615
They did a bunch of stuff to him and he's just watching him

712
00:42:24,127 --> 00:42:25,919
I love the idea that Alex is like

713
00:42:26,175 --> 00:42:29,247
Secret sources trust me because they know that I don't talk

714
00:42:30,527 --> 00:42:34,111
Biagio scared

715
00:42:36,159 --> 00:42:39,487
Trustworthy person in the world

716
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:44,095
Conversation

717
00:42:44,351 --> 00:42:50,495
Gossiping in the in the foyer with a couple of friends I understand

718
00:42:50,751 --> 00:42:52,799
Any kind of like public sort of thing

719
00:42:53,055 --> 00:42:55,103
You do kind of have to train yourself a tiny bit

720
00:42:55,359 --> 00:42:57,919
To get over the fact that a lot of people listen to a thing

721
00:42:58,175 --> 00:43:00,223
Because if you really sat down and thought about

722
00:43:00,479 --> 00:43:02,271
Implications of like

723
00:43:02,527 --> 00:43:06,623
Every single ear that hears the word that you say you'll be so overwhelming

724
00:43:06,879 --> 00:43:11,231
Very difficult to deal with extreme of that to the point

725
00:43:11,487 --> 00:43:13,535
Arrington bongino's alleged

726
00:43:13,791 --> 00:43:17,119
Dirty business is private s***

727
00:43:17,375 --> 00:43:18,399
Like that's not cool

728
00:43:19,167 --> 00:43:20,959
I don't know if I'd have a partial his

729
00:43:21,471 --> 00:43:27,615
She didn't want anybody to know that but what am I

730
00:43:27,871 --> 00:43:33,759
Piece of information

731
00:43:34,015 --> 00:43:35,039
That

732
00:43:35,295 --> 00:43:41,439
But I'm a good friend will swear and then be like cut that out

733
00:43:46,047 --> 00:43:50,655
Well feel good stuff that's so gold it seems like if you're betraying a confidence

734
00:43:51,679 --> 00:43:55,263
You would have to realize what a betrayal actually be

735
00:43:56,287 --> 00:43:56,799
Turn off

736
00:43:57,055 --> 00:43:58,591
Call Gino's

737
00:43:59,615 --> 00:44:01,663
And all these people and media

738
00:44:01,919 --> 00:44:02,687
Who are

739
00:44:02,943 --> 00:44:03,711
Down

740
00:44:03,967 --> 00:44:09,087
With helping out with Patrick bergey they're all just scared and blackmailed

741
00:44:09,599 --> 00:44:14,719
I don't know what his justification might be yours

742
00:44:17,023 --> 00:44:18,303
Box Elder

743
00:44:20,863 --> 00:44:24,959
It wasn't guys are good people

744
00:44:26,495 --> 00:44:27,263
He's totally

745
00:44:33,663 --> 00:44:37,759
Only explanation

746
00:44:38,271 --> 00:44:41,599
Prototype how to defeat them

747
00:44:41,855 --> 00:44:42,879
Yeah

748
00:44:43,391 --> 00:44:49,535
This is he really think she might have actually done it this time

749
00:44:49,791 --> 00:44:54,399
Is at least one to cover his ass

750
00:44:54,655 --> 00:44:56,447
He's really going hard

751
00:44:56,959 --> 00:44:58,495
Yeah so

752
00:44:58,751 --> 00:45:04,895
They have a disappointing end to the episode and actually because Alex

753
00:45:05,151 --> 00:45:05,663
Ends up like

754
00:45:06,431 --> 00:45:12,575
I guess not thinking that Millie being arrested and this documentary is what needs to be talked about for the rest of the show

755
00:45:12,831 --> 00:45:15,903
Because he's like

756
00:45:17,183 --> 00:45:23,327
Over the weekend he's going to go back to the test

757
00:45:34,335 --> 00:45:40,479
He had a real boy bullhorn

758
00:45:40,735 --> 00:45:41,247
Come to Saturday

759
00:45:42,271 --> 00:45:44,575
Video on Saturday

760
00:45:45,087 --> 00:45:46,367
Supposed to be an update

761
00:45:46,879 --> 00:45:48,415
On the situation with Millie

762
00:46:05,311 --> 00:46:06,079
Contractors

763
00:46:09,663 --> 00:46:10,175
Gabon

764
00:46:14,015 --> 00:46:14,783
They don't know

765
00:46:23,487 --> 00:46:23,999
Other things

766
00:46:30,399 --> 00:46:34,495
I got to say like there is a sort of sensibility

767
00:46:34,751 --> 00:46:35,775
It's coming out of Alex

768
00:46:36,031 --> 00:46:39,359
Because he thought he talks about how like the

769
00:46:39,615 --> 00:46:40,383
The police

770
00:46:40,639 --> 00:46:43,199
Seemed weird you know like the video it seems

771
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:50,879
Nothing I understand

772
00:46:52,159 --> 00:46:53,695
Indicates

773
00:46:53,951 --> 00:46:56,255
A little bit of the self-awareness

774
00:46:57,279 --> 00:47:00,095
Even though I don't really believe in a good off the rails

775
00:47:00,607 --> 00:47:01,631
I think that's a

776
00:47:01,887 --> 00:47:02,655
Liquor of

777
00:47:02,911 --> 00:47:09,055
Some sort of rationality that you rarely seeing him take a lawyer next to him to get him to

778
00:47:10,847 --> 00:47:12,127
Where is Barnes neck

779
00:47:13,919 --> 00:47:19,807
Just said the Shadows has mentioned talking to barzal a couple times

780
00:47:21,343 --> 00:47:22,623
But he does not make an appearance

781
00:47:23,391 --> 00:47:24,671
He gets out

782
00:47:24,927 --> 00:47:26,975
Get to talkin about this and apparently

783
00:47:27,231 --> 00:47:30,815
Friday show Alex said the documentary was supposed to come out on Thursday

784
00:47:31,071 --> 00:47:31,583
Prior

785
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:32,863
So I would win the 13th

786
00:47:33,375 --> 00:47:35,679
Now it turns out there's a different release date

787
00:47:46,175 --> 00:47:47,199
It's that the film

788
00:47:47,455 --> 00:47:48,223
Supposed to come out

789
00:47:57,183 --> 00:47:57,695
Whistleblower

790
00:48:07,935 --> 00:48:08,959
It was a free film

791
00:48:13,055 --> 00:48:14,335
She's really in jail

792
00:48:15,103 --> 00:48:20,735
I agree that they didn't stay now we have Thursday was supposed to come out

793
00:48:21,247 --> 00:48:24,319
Call it's confusing and a guy that you

794
00:48:24,575 --> 00:48:26,367
Didn't have on the show because you

795
00:48:26,623 --> 00:48:27,135
Weren't

796
00:48:27,391 --> 00:48:29,951
Sure who he was was already

797
00:48:30,207 --> 00:48:31,487
Pre-scheduled 41

798
00:48:33,279 --> 00:48:36,095
And it's it's strange because

799
00:48:36,863 --> 00:48:41,215
Fredericksburg

800
00:48:41,983 --> 00:48:42,751
And keep in mind

801
00:48:43,263 --> 00:48:45,055
They weren't planning to upload the video

802
00:48:45,311 --> 00:48:46,335
Yesterday they weren't going

803
00:48:46,591 --> 00:48:47,615
I'm planning to be done with it

804
00:48:47,871 --> 00:48:48,639
Monday

805
00:48:51,199 --> 00:48:52,223
And so

806
00:48:53,759 --> 00:48:54,271
Preemptive

807
00:48:54,783 --> 00:48:55,295
Action

808
00:48:55,807 --> 00:49:01,695
So in his video over the weekend about heading to Ohio.

809
00:49:01,951 --> 00:49:05,791
Sure he says that the video wasn't even supposed to come out until the next Monday

810
00:49:06,303 --> 00:49:09,887
We have three different release dates alright

811
00:49:10,143 --> 00:49:11,167
Two different people

812
00:49:11,423 --> 00:49:14,495
Provided

813
00:49:15,263 --> 00:49:15,775
But

814
00:49:16,031 --> 00:49:18,591
The difference in them is one is Future

815
00:49:18,847 --> 00:49:20,383
The other has passed

816
00:49:20,639 --> 00:49:22,687
I don't know I don't know what

817
00:49:22,943 --> 00:49:23,967
I don't know what's real

818
00:49:24,479 --> 00:49:25,503
Also don't care

819
00:49:27,807 --> 00:49:30,623
Hair with real

820
00:49:31,135 --> 00:49:32,927
I would like to know

821
00:49:33,183 --> 00:49:39,327
I don't even want to know I'm more interested in the fact that there are these discrepancies

822
00:49:39,583 --> 00:49:40,095
Resolve

823
00:49:40,351 --> 00:49:42,911
That are just left dangling

824
00:49:43,423 --> 00:49:45,983
Well I mean one of the reasons is everybody's full of s***

825
00:49:46,239 --> 00:49:46,751
There is that

826
00:49:47,775 --> 00:49:53,407
And you know what's interesting just like a compulsive liar they ain't none of them could tell you the real release date even if they

827
00:49:53,663 --> 00:49:54,175
Wanted to

828
00:49:54,431 --> 00:49:55,199
Probably not

829
00:49:55,455 --> 00:49:59,551
But what's interesting is in this video that Bergie put out over the weekend

830
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:03,903
He is not so into Alex after the interview

831
00:50:04,159 --> 00:50:05,951
He is turned on Alice

832
00:50:06,207 --> 00:50:07,487
What I saw was

833
00:50:09,023 --> 00:50:13,119
Alex Jones yesterday was pretty kind of disappointing one of his

834
00:50:16,191 --> 00:50:16,959
Reporters one of his

835
00:50:19,007 --> 00:50:25,151
Are subcontractors you know I don't know if you saw the same thing as I did but

836
00:50:25,407 --> 00:50:31,551
Pretty much any cover-your-ass mode the whole time that's the last

837
00:50:31,807 --> 00:50:34,367
I believe Alex

838
00:50:34,623 --> 00:50:35,647
Listen

839
00:50:35,903 --> 00:50:41,279
He's full of s*** I don't agree with him on anything 100%

840
00:50:41,535 --> 00:50:45,119
Right before I saw the video

841
00:50:46,399 --> 00:50:46,911
Watch

842
00:50:47,167 --> 00:50:51,007
Show

843
00:50:53,823 --> 00:50:55,103
I don't know Billy

844
00:50:57,407 --> 00:51:03,551
Now

845
00:51:03,807 --> 00:51:08,415
Just that I've never met the woman before

846
00:51:08,671 --> 00:51:09,439
Sure

847
00:51:09,695 --> 00:51:10,719
So Alex

848
00:51:10,975 --> 00:51:12,767
Back to his Saturday report now

849
00:51:13,023 --> 00:51:15,327
And Alex has a spin on this

850
00:51:16,607 --> 00:51:18,655
This is probably as good as you're going to do

851
00:51:23,775 --> 00:51:24,543
Do you want to go

852
00:51:37,855 --> 00:51:39,391
Videotaping videos at doctor

853
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:50,399
Wheel NSA whistleblowers

854
00:51:50,911 --> 00:51:51,423
Real

855
00:52:08,063 --> 00:52:08,831
So

856
00:52:11,647 --> 00:52:15,231
This is weird because Alex has been talked to someone who talked to

857
00:52:17,535 --> 00:52:19,583
Confessed to him that they took the phone

858
00:52:20,095 --> 00:52:26,239
I don't understand

859
00:52:28,031 --> 00:52:34,175
Apparently the story now is it I mean because the information has come out that this is what the arrest.

860
00:52:34,431 --> 00:52:38,015
Architectural

861
00:52:38,271 --> 00:52:40,575
It's not terrible

862
00:52:40,831 --> 00:52:46,463
Harold takes Nikki snapshot information percentage

863
00:52:46,719 --> 00:52:52,863
And it's definitely not something she was being verbally abused

864
00:52:53,119 --> 00:52:56,191
Question some very almost certainly raise the ship was said

865
00:52:56,703 --> 00:52:57,471
Maybe and there we go

866
00:52:57,727 --> 00:53:00,287
So Alex claims in this next clip

867
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:03,359
That was sort of

868
00:53:03,871 --> 00:53:04,383
The reason

869
00:53:07,711 --> 00:53:08,991
Which we know is not true

870
00:53:10,783 --> 00:53:16,671
Unless Millie brought Ivan that doesn't make sense either cuz it's a show

871
00:53:16,927 --> 00:53:17,695
Texas never met either

872
00:53:17,951 --> 00:53:20,255
Do anybody

873
00:53:39,455 --> 00:53:40,223
Used to fix

874
00:53:40,735 --> 00:53:42,783
Yeah that's really

875
00:53:43,039 --> 00:53:46,367
Coronavirus map

876
00:53:48,927 --> 00:53:54,815
The deal with the real people multiple times

877
00:53:55,839 --> 00:54:01,983
I'm hanging out with weirdos who are making s*** up

878
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:04,799
There's no other way to take that right there's no other way to read that

879
00:54:05,055 --> 00:54:09,663
But I like to do is I like to hang out with me

880
00:54:11,199 --> 00:54:12,223
Billy on the other hand

881
00:54:12,479 --> 00:54:18,623
People who seemed more real at the red flag

882
00:54:21,695 --> 00:54:22,719
Is Allen

883
00:54:22,975 --> 00:54:25,791
100

884
00:54:26,047 --> 00:54:32,191
I look I'll be honest with you I was not used to being around such scary people and it led to me being

885
00:54:32,447 --> 00:54:35,007
That's why I passed out before my headlining speech

886
00:54:35,519 --> 00:54:36,799
I would immediately be like

887
00:54:37,311 --> 00:54:41,663
That's self-effacing probably not something you make it upright

888
00:54:41,919 --> 00:54:48,063
I buy it I wouldn't believe it was true but I believe there was his experience of

889
00:54:48,575 --> 00:54:50,623
He's not done

890
00:54:52,671 --> 00:54:54,463
People that Billy is talking to

891
00:54:54,719 --> 00:54:58,559
May be involved

892
00:54:58,815 --> 00:54:59,327
John Brennan

893
00:55:17,247 --> 00:55:18,015
Not true

894
00:55:18,527 --> 00:55:20,063
Some of these people have been slacking

895
00:55:20,319 --> 00:55:24,671
This is Patrick

896
00:55:26,207 --> 00:55:29,791
100-percent Patrick

897
00:55:30,047 --> 00:55:35,167
You can sort of tell that from his video that he also put out of the weekend

898
00:55:35,423 --> 00:55:35,935
If you don't

899
00:55:36,959 --> 00:55:37,471
Time in Helena

900
00:55:37,727 --> 00:55:38,495
Alex Jones

901
00:55:39,775 --> 00:55:40,287
The biggest

902
00:55:40,543 --> 00:55:41,823
F****** conspiracy theorists

903
00:55:42,335 --> 00:55:42,847
Planet

904
00:55:43,615 --> 00:55:45,663
Doesn't see this is an issue

905
00:55:46,431 --> 00:55:46,943
Please

906
00:55:47,199 --> 00:55:48,223
F****** is dirty as I

907
00:55:48,479 --> 00:55:48,991
31

908
00:55:51,039 --> 00:55:52,831
Assured me that he was

909
00:55:53,599 --> 00:55:54,879
He was a straight-up guy

910
00:55:55,135 --> 00:55:56,671
We were concerned about people

911
00:55:56,927 --> 00:55:57,951
Possibly around it

912
00:55:59,487 --> 00:55:59,999
They said he was

913
00:56:00,255 --> 00:56:01,535
Straight-up guy Infowars

914
00:56:01,791 --> 00:56:03,071
Do the right thing with it

915
00:56:04,607 --> 00:56:05,887
Clearly

916
00:56:07,167 --> 00:56:09,727
Millie Alex

917
00:56:11,775 --> 00:56:16,127
Clearly what's going on here is the Patrick Burger Express

918
00:56:16,383 --> 00:56:22,527
Concerns about Alex 2 Milly Milly I guess the somehow got back

919
00:56:22,783 --> 00:56:25,599
Alex probably through Millie and

920
00:56:25,855 --> 00:56:26,879
Alex has taken

921
00:56:27,135 --> 00:56:27,903
This to be

922
00:56:28,159 --> 00:56:32,511
Either John Brennan Defector that she's talking to because it doesn't make sense

923
00:56:33,023 --> 00:56:34,047
Because he's from the

924
00:56:34,303 --> 00:56:36,351
Jim Jones of James Jones win

925
00:56:36,607 --> 00:56:40,959
He was a contractor for dynology which is the other side of the conspiracy

926
00:56:41,471 --> 00:56:43,263
Tori is the one who supposedly was working

927
00:56:43,519 --> 00:56:46,335
No one can get your lies straight

928
00:56:46,591 --> 00:56:48,639
Yes it's all convoluted but

929
00:56:48,895 --> 00:56:49,407
I am

930
00:56:49,919 --> 00:56:50,687
Freezer

931
00:56:50,943 --> 00:56:56,575
Yes it was talking s*** about Alex

932
00:56:56,831 --> 00:56:57,343
Alex

933
00:56:57,855 --> 00:56:58,367
I don't think

934
00:56:58,623 --> 00:56:59,135
Is thrilled

935
00:57:00,927 --> 00:57:07,071
Wednesday or Thursday

936
00:57:07,327 --> 00:57:10,911
Azhar solo

937
00:57:11,167 --> 00:57:12,191
Yes

938
00:57:12,447 --> 00:57:15,007
Percent

939
00:57:15,775 --> 00:57:18,079
That Millie got arrested because of this video

940
00:57:32,415 --> 00:57:32,927
You got

941
00:57:33,695 --> 00:57:34,463
YouTube for now

942
00:57:41,887 --> 00:57:43,935
It's like it by Saturday

943
00:57:44,191 --> 00:57:45,983
Which terrified

944
00:57:50,079 --> 00:57:51,615
Call somebody who said

945
00:57:51,871 --> 00:57:58,015
She's into some real secrets

946
00:57:58,271 --> 00:58:01,599
Suddenly put it on his website

947
00:58:01,855 --> 00:58:04,671
The either you seen it there's some traffic you could get from it

948
00:58:06,719 --> 00:58:07,487
He's watched it

949
00:58:07,743 --> 00:58:08,767
And he's like hell yeah

950
00:58:09,791 --> 00:58:12,095
That seems weird to me though because

951
00:58:12,607 --> 00:58:18,751
Rodger Stone does take couple hits

952
00:58:19,263 --> 00:58:25,407
But he's not mad about that on Saturday figure out what you're doing Alex

953
00:58:25,663 --> 00:58:29,247
Or else he would be complaining about Rodger Stone

954
00:58:29,503 --> 00:58:33,599
Get your s*** together everybody get your house in order

955
00:58:33,855 --> 00:58:34,367
Anyway

956
00:58:34,879 --> 00:58:36,671
Alex signs off on Saturday

957
00:58:37,183 --> 00:58:38,719
It probably about the movie

958
00:58:39,231 --> 00:58:40,255
Think about Millie Weaver she

959
00:58:46,143 --> 00:58:47,167
That we all

960
00:58:51,007 --> 00:58:52,799
The Deep state

961
00:58:57,919 --> 00:59:00,223
I love that timing like that is

962
00:59:00,479 --> 00:59:03,039
Probably amazing delivery

963
00:59:03,295 --> 00:59:07,647
Expensive but I got to pray for Billy she's in jail

964
00:59:08,671 --> 00:59:11,487
Kevin Nealon

965
00:59:12,255 --> 00:59:14,303
Real good

966
00:59:15,583 --> 00:59:16,095
Real good

967
00:59:16,351 --> 00:59:16,863
Subway

968
00:59:17,119 --> 00:59:19,679
So we get to Sundays

969
00:59:19,935 --> 00:59:20,703
August 6th

970
00:59:20,959 --> 00:59:25,567
Steve and on Saturday Alex also did protest

971
00:59:25,823 --> 00:59:26,591
At the Greenbelt

972
00:59:28,127 --> 00:59:31,199
And I will say

973
00:59:31,711 --> 00:59:32,735
It was an okay turnout

974
00:59:32,991 --> 00:59:34,015
Okay not

975
00:59:34,271 --> 00:59:34,783
Huge

976
00:59:35,807 --> 00:59:37,087
There were some people there

977
00:59:38,879 --> 00:59:40,159
Did they take back

978
00:59:40,415 --> 00:59:41,183
The Parker what was the

979
00:59:41,439 --> 00:59:44,511
Did they all get in I think so I didn't watch

980
00:59:44,767 --> 00:59:46,815
A ton of footage of it but I did see

981
00:59:47,071 --> 00:59:48,351
Pictures of people swimming

982
00:59:51,423 --> 00:59:57,567
I also want to show on Sunday

983
00:59:57,823 --> 01:00:02,687
Any does scream we're coming back next week and I'll bring enough food truck so I think

984
01:00:03,455 --> 01:00:09,599
I think Alex is going to spend this off into

985
01:00:09,855 --> 01:00:10,623
Progesterone

986
01:00:12,671 --> 01:00:16,255
Oh you better let us enter together

987
01:00:17,279 --> 01:00:22,143
Well then we'll have a picnic I guess it seems like this could turn into a series of

988
01:00:22,399 --> 01:00:23,679
Outdoor

989
01:00:24,703 --> 01:00:28,287
Steam really quick

990
01:00:28,543 --> 01:00:29,567
Does not Occupy Wall Street

991
01:00:30,335 --> 01:00:31,871
Not all is well in paradise

992
01:00:32,127 --> 01:00:37,247
Alex starts off the Sunday show given a little bit of an apology about that rally

993
01:00:40,063 --> 01:00:42,111
Myself and others

994
01:00:47,999 --> 01:00:51,071
I apologize to the people to collapse

995
01:00:52,351 --> 01:00:56,703
Stop

996
01:00:58,495 --> 01:00:59,263
Oh no

997
01:01:00,031 --> 01:01:01,055
Oh God

998
01:01:01,311 --> 01:01:06,687
But I'd like to apologize about the couple of

999
01:01:06,943 --> 01:01:07,967
The few people

1000
01:01:08,991 --> 01:01:10,015
The group of people who

1001
01:01:10,527 --> 01:01:15,647
Just to let everybody know it wasn't my ideas

1002
01:01:15,903 --> 01:01:22,047
It was it was it was a good day everybody said that a great time it's not

1003
01:01:22,559 --> 01:01:25,119
Fault that people would have heat exhaustion

1004
01:01:26,911 --> 01:01:31,519
Responsibility to understand

1005
01:01:32,031 --> 01:01:32,543
It is

1006
01:01:32,799 --> 01:01:36,895
Very funny to hear Alex we like this event was a success

1007
01:01:37,151 --> 01:01:42,271
Now I apologies that some of you passed out from heat exhaustion

1008
01:01:42,527 --> 01:01:43,039
Ta things

1009
01:01:43,295 --> 01:01:45,599
That is the thing that you say after

1010
01:01:45,855 --> 01:01:49,439
Successful bake sale that went on too long in front of the Walmart

1011
01:01:49,695 --> 01:01:50,207
And you lost

1012
01:01:52,255 --> 01:01:52,767
Very strange

1013
01:01:53,535 --> 01:01:56,095
So Alex now a days

1014
01:01:56,351 --> 01:01:58,655
Do you think your responsibility to have

1015
01:01:58,911 --> 01:02:01,215
Who are the facts of the story correctly

1016
01:02:02,751 --> 01:02:04,031
I think he might have

1017
01:02:04,799 --> 01:02:08,895
But you also has some of the facts wrong about Millie's arrest

1018
01:02:15,295 --> 01:02:16,319
Bicycle shop

1019
01:02:18,879 --> 01:02:19,647
Millie Weaver

1020
01:02:20,671 --> 01:02:22,975
Husband and an end

1021
01:02:23,231 --> 01:02:24,511
Gavin her husband's brother

1022
01:02:26,303 --> 01:02:27,071
In Ohio

1023
01:02:27,327 --> 01:02:28,607
It's not Gavin's brother

1024
01:02:28,863 --> 01:02:29,375
Melly's brother

1025
01:02:29,631 --> 01:02:33,215
Factual inaccuracies

1026
01:02:33,471 --> 01:02:35,263
And he says it's a couple times

1027
01:02:35,519 --> 01:02:40,383
I don't think there's any of you like purpose or malice

1028
01:02:41,151 --> 01:02:47,295
I don't I don't see any reason why I would be like a cover-up

1029
01:02:47,807 --> 01:02:48,831
The story

1030
01:02:49,087 --> 01:02:51,391
Is very close to him

1031
01:02:51,903 --> 01:02:52,671
You would think

1032
01:02:52,927 --> 01:02:53,951
You know that

1033
01:02:54,719 --> 01:02:55,231
Yeah

1034
01:02:55,487 --> 01:03:01,119
Kind of really gives you a picture of a guy who's just like I do

1035
01:03:01,375 --> 01:03:03,679
Total Care

1036
01:03:04,191 --> 01:03:04,703
Pages

1037
01:03:04,959 --> 01:03:05,727
We're moving.

1038
01:03:06,751 --> 01:03:07,263
Went

1039
01:03:07,519 --> 01:03:09,055
2 Barton Springs

1040
01:03:09,567 --> 01:03:12,383
I went to the Greenbelt we drank some beers

1041
01:03:12,639 --> 01:03:14,687
Next week

1042
01:03:14,943 --> 01:03:15,711
I don't care

1043
01:03:15,967 --> 01:03:19,295
Billy's into some secret s***. Going to get in the way of

1044
01:03:19,551 --> 01:03:21,087
My block party

1045
01:03:22,623 --> 01:03:24,159
The week after that we're going to be

1046
01:03:24,927 --> 01:03:25,695
Fucktrump

1047
01:03:26,463 --> 01:03:27,999
I love to party

1048
01:03:29,279 --> 01:03:35,423
Legendary

1049
01:03:35,679 --> 01:03:37,471
Is Alex

1050
01:03:37,727 --> 01:03:39,263
No more politics

1051
01:03:39,519 --> 01:03:40,543
Here's how we're going to beat the Globus

1052
01:03:41,055 --> 01:03:42,591
Where is starter fraternities

1053
01:03:46,687 --> 01:03:50,015
Coming up is it exemplifying the turn of ourselves

1054
01:03:50,271 --> 01:03:53,343
Bring it up Andrew w.k.

1055
01:03:55,903 --> 01:04:00,255
And after him by our next guest is going to be this dude to get a keg stand for like

1056
01:04:00,511 --> 01:04:04,351
4 minutes down Barton Springs he is so cool

1057
01:04:04,607 --> 01:04:10,751
Moose look I don't know what the guys name is

1058
01:04:12,799 --> 01:04:18,943
Until you take that put up with him for a little bit

1059
01:04:19,199 --> 01:04:23,807
Show the drag for a bit

1060
01:04:24,831 --> 01:04:27,647
God damn it I would love it

1061
01:04:27,903 --> 01:04:31,231
Infowars info party

1062
01:04:31,487 --> 01:04:33,791
Party Wars

1063
01:04:34,815 --> 01:04:37,119
Have you better show

1064
01:04:38,655 --> 01:04:40,703
So at this point

1065
01:04:40,959 --> 01:04:42,239
On the 16th

1066
01:04:42,751 --> 01:04:46,079
I think Alex is punting

1067
01:04:49,151 --> 01:04:55,295
I'm afraid that you might have actually done no

1068
01:04:55,551 --> 01:04:59,391
I think she's beat up my mom

1069
01:05:05,279 --> 01:05:05,791
So

1070
01:05:08,095 --> 01:05:09,375
Use the

1071
01:05:10,143 --> 01:05:13,471
Not in so many words but on Sunday

1072
01:05:18,847 --> 01:05:21,151
Was she arrested for anything to do

1073
01:05:22,431 --> 01:05:22,943
The film

1074
01:05:23,967 --> 01:05:24,479
Shadow

1075
01:05:26,783 --> 01:05:28,063
The answer is probably not

1076
01:05:29,855 --> 01:05:30,367
But that

1077
01:05:31,391 --> 01:05:35,743
What is going to end up always being thought about this because the timing of the twin sitters if so

1078
01:05:38,815 --> 01:05:40,095
No s***

1079
01:05:41,375 --> 01:05:45,215
I also the Alex is still on the angle of it being a little bit like

1080
01:05:45,983 --> 01:05:49,311
There's possibly a conspiracy

1081
01:05:49,567 --> 01:05:51,615
Trumping up an existing charge

1082
01:05:51,871 --> 01:05:56,991
Still like some angles

1083
01:05:57,247 --> 01:05:57,759
But he is

1084
01:05:58,015 --> 01:05:59,295
Definitely kind of

1085
01:05:59,807 --> 01:06:01,343
I think he's mad at Birdy

1086
01:06:01,599 --> 01:06:06,463
First of all that might be coloring

1087
01:06:06,719 --> 01:06:08,255
And he's just like

1088
01:06:08,511 --> 01:06:11,327
I don't know it's like anybody arrested

1089
01:06:11,583 --> 01:06:17,727
I don't I don't have the energy so personally betrayed

1090
01:06:17,983 --> 01:06:21,055
Milanese made more elaborate

1091
01:06:21,311 --> 01:06:21,823
Conspiracy

1092
01:06:22,079 --> 01:06:23,615
Conspiracies out of less

1093
01:06:23,871 --> 01:06:26,687
And stuck to them in the face of overwhelming evidence

1094
01:06:26,943 --> 01:06:30,015
And you can't even come up with that half-assed

1095
01:06:30,271 --> 01:06:32,063
Bulshit for Billy you're just like

1096
01:06:36,159 --> 01:06:38,207
I don't know I mean it just out of it

1097
01:06:39,231 --> 01:06:40,255
I feel like

1098
01:06:41,023 --> 01:06:42,303
It's got to feel shity

1099
01:06:42,815 --> 01:06:46,911
Because it's the same thing with like promoting her GoFundMe

1100
01:06:47,167 --> 01:06:50,239
Yeah because the premise of the GoFundMe

1101
01:06:50,495 --> 01:06:52,799
Was Jesus rested she's a journalist

1102
01:06:53,055 --> 01:06:57,151
And the games you're playing our that you was arrested because of some Intrepid journalism

1103
01:06:57,407 --> 01:07:00,735
If she was arrested because of a domestic

1104
01:07:00,991 --> 01:07:06,879
Violence incident the chief and two other people enacted upon her mother it becomes thing works like

1105
01:07:07,391 --> 01:07:12,767
Wait I thought I was supporting independent journalism I just paid $100 to help out someone who beat up their mom

1106
01:07:13,023 --> 01:07:15,839
Yeah like that feels bad and for Alex I think

1107
01:07:16,095 --> 01:07:16,607
Like

1108
01:07:16,863 --> 01:07:23,007
You don't have any need to do this and there's no money in it for him

1109
01:07:23,263 --> 01:07:26,591
Documentary

1110
01:07:26,847 --> 01:07:29,151
I think he realizes also like

1111
01:07:29,407 --> 01:07:30,175
Hey

1112
01:07:30,431 --> 01:07:35,551
When project Veritas puts out something it's all over Twitter trends like crazy

1113
01:07:35,807 --> 01:07:41,695
This didn't move the needle that much or not that upset

1114
01:07:41,951 --> 01:07:43,231
Do witches like the ultimate

1115
01:07:43,487 --> 01:07:48,095
Remove the needle kind of freedom I think a lot of people

1116
01:07:48,607 --> 01:07:49,887
Serta got a sense of like

1117
01:07:50,399 --> 01:07:51,167
Probably reason

1118
01:07:51,423 --> 01:07:52,959
This said this raft happen

1119
01:07:54,239 --> 01:07:55,519
So you look bad

1120
01:07:57,823 --> 01:08:00,639
Documentaries good we still on it's the Gate of all gay

1121
01:08:01,407 --> 01:08:02,687
No I don't think we owe

1122
01:08:02,943 --> 01:08:05,247
Arabic

1123
01:08:05,503 --> 01:08:06,015
Good

1124
01:08:06,527 --> 01:08:07,039
Now

1125
01:08:07,295 --> 01:08:09,343
Black beans

1126
01:08:09,599 --> 01:08:11,903
Patrick Bergey's Phyllis

1127
01:08:17,023 --> 01:08:17,791
Operate

1128
01:08:18,303 --> 01:08:20,863
Rodger cupcake me a call this morning

1129
01:08:21,887 --> 01:08:22,399
Evike

1130
01:08:23,423 --> 01:08:24,191
That General

1131
01:08:24,447 --> 01:08:24,959
Jones

1132
01:08:25,727 --> 01:08:28,543
Paul manafort net worth of them over 20 plus years he's my friend

1133
01:08:29,311 --> 01:08:31,871
Rodger Stone sentence

1134
01:08:46,207 --> 01:08:47,231
Going on

1135
01:08:47,487 --> 01:08:49,791
You did already know

1136
01:08:57,215 --> 01:08:58,239
Yeah we know

1137
01:09:08,735 --> 01:09:14,879
But like you said during the breaks

1138
01:09:15,135 --> 01:09:17,183
Representation

1139
01:09:17,439 --> 01:09:19,231
Apparently Rodger called in that morning

1140
01:09:19,487 --> 01:09:19,999
And with

1141
01:09:21,279 --> 01:09:27,423
So now Alex has another pair you share this documentary

1142
01:09:27,679 --> 01:09:29,727
Has to pull off now which is like

1143
01:09:31,007 --> 01:09:31,775
Documentary

1144
01:09:32,287 --> 01:09:33,311
About the media being

1145
01:09:33,567 --> 01:09:36,639
Controlled by the globalist forces

1146
01:09:37,151 --> 01:09:37,663
I like that

1147
01:09:38,175 --> 01:09:38,687
Like that

1148
01:09:39,199 --> 01:09:40,479
I don't want to be against that

1149
01:09:41,247 --> 01:09:41,759
But this guy

1150
01:09:44,063 --> 01:09:45,087
Like I don't like him

1151
01:09:45,343 --> 01:09:47,391
And he's talking to about my guy Rodger

1152
01:09:48,415 --> 01:09:51,743
Personal and professional lives are coming together in a way that is so

1153
01:09:51,999 --> 01:09:54,303
Usual for me so I'm going to say

1154
01:09:54,559 --> 01:09:55,839
Is it dark batteries good

1155
01:09:56,351 --> 01:09:56,863
But

1156
01:09:57,887 --> 01:09:59,935
This guy they talked

1157
01:10:00,191 --> 01:10:00,959
Is it

1158
01:10:01,215 --> 01:10:03,007
Functionally half of the documents

1159
01:10:07,103 --> 01:10:12,479
Because he's the guy who claims that he invented the technology

1160
01:10:12,735 --> 01:10:14,527
In terms of people who hat like

1161
01:10:15,551 --> 01:10:18,879
Both him and Tori are Central figures in the

1162
01:10:19,135 --> 01:10:24,255
Even more so about

1163
01:10:27,839 --> 01:10:31,935
I think you either of them you can get rid of whatever they're bringing to the table

1164
01:10:34,751 --> 01:10:37,311
Closer to a keystone

1165
01:10:37,823 --> 01:10:38,335
And they're both

1166
01:10:39,103 --> 01:10:39,871
Nonsense but

1167
01:10:40,895 --> 01:10:42,175
It's so crazy

1168
01:10:42,431 --> 01:10:45,247
It's pretty wild for me to hear Alex be like

1169
01:10:45,503 --> 01:10:46,015
Yes

1170
01:10:46,527 --> 01:10:52,159
The central focus of this documentary is a lying piece of s***

1171
01:10:52,415 --> 01:10:55,743
Talks very seriously and earnestly it agrees with everything that

1172
01:10:56,511 --> 01:10:58,303
Giant piece of s*** says

1173
01:10:58,559 --> 01:11:03,935
I don't worry about that my apparently independent

1174
01:11:07,519 --> 01:11:12,383
It was all of this she thinks he's great

1175
01:11:13,919 --> 01:11:14,431
Alex

1176
01:11:14,687 --> 01:11:15,967
Seems like he got

1177
01:11:16,479 --> 01:11:20,319
Yeah he doesn't like that

1178
01:11:20,575 --> 01:11:21,087
Rarely

1179
01:11:21,599 --> 01:11:25,439
I don't know if I can think of the last time I've sent this vibe from him was like

1180
01:11:27,999 --> 01:11:29,279
People fuk to me

1181
01:11:29,535 --> 01:11:31,071
We just bring it and say hey

1182
01:11:33,119 --> 01:11:34,655
Alex

1183
01:11:37,727 --> 01:11:38,239
Thanks a lot

1184
01:11:42,335 --> 01:11:43,871
Level

1185
01:11:45,151 --> 01:11:45,919
What happens

1186
01:11:46,431 --> 01:11:47,967
In this whole tumors is

1187
01:11:52,575 --> 01:11:54,879
Trump jacket

1188
01:12:00,511 --> 01:12:03,583
But

1189
01:12:08,959 --> 01:12:10,495
That is a distraction can't wait

1190
01:12:11,775 --> 01:12:13,055
Out of

1191
01:12:15,103 --> 01:12:19,199
He is mad

1192
01:12:20,479 --> 01:12:22,783
Is reference

1193
01:12:23,039 --> 01:12:26,623
Where's all the time

1194
01:12:26,879 --> 01:12:29,695
The leather vest that is Trump's bikers

1195
01:12:29,951 --> 01:12:32,255
He's not thrilled about that bass

1196
01:12:33,279 --> 01:12:36,095
So yeah he's decided that to Bergey's just like qanon

1197
01:12:38,143 --> 01:12:40,959
He doesn't like me I don't like

1198
01:12:41,471 --> 01:12:43,263
Alex has Rodger on

1199
01:12:43,519 --> 01:12:45,567
Because Rodger called him mad that morning

1200
01:12:46,079 --> 01:12:52,223
And because brother dies and Rodger knew him

1201
01:12:59,391 --> 01:13:01,439
Cuz you gone through a lot Rodger Trump gone through a lot

1202
01:13:05,279 --> 01:13:06,559
Amore has been you

1203
01:13:07,071 --> 01:13:11,423
I guess that bridge got killed so I guess he paid more there's been a lot of people paying

1204
01:13:12,447 --> 01:13:14,751
Interesting Alex

1205
01:13:15,007 --> 01:13:15,775
Interesting

1206
01:13:16,543 --> 01:13:17,055
That's a weird

1207
01:13:17,311 --> 01:13:18,591
Undercutting

1208
01:13:18,847 --> 01:13:20,895
Nobody's paid as much as you I mean silver

1209
01:13:21,663 --> 01:13:23,199
I know that Alex

1210
01:13:23,711 --> 01:13:24,479
Microsoft

1211
01:13:24,991 --> 01:13:26,015
Pedaling

1212
01:13:26,271 --> 01:13:30,111
Words back into separate

1213
01:13:30,367 --> 01:13:35,231
But I've not heard him fully commit and selected this is kind of interesting to because now

1214
01:13:35,487 --> 01:13:38,303
That indicates to me that the editorial position just over

1215
01:13:38,559 --> 01:13:41,631
Passively

1216
01:13:42,143 --> 01:13:42,911
Hillary

1217
01:13:43,167 --> 01:13:43,935
Right right

1218
01:13:44,447 --> 01:13:45,983
So that's interesting

1219
01:13:46,751 --> 01:13:47,263
Great

1220
01:13:49,055 --> 01:13:50,079
You don't say

1221
01:13:50,847 --> 01:13:51,359
They would

1222
01:13:52,127 --> 01:13:52,639
Actually

1223
01:13:53,663 --> 01:13:55,199
Fair enough

1224
01:13:55,967 --> 01:13:57,759
A convenience

1225
01:13:58,015 --> 01:13:58,783
So

1226
01:13:59,551 --> 01:14:00,831
Patrick Bergin

1227
01:14:01,343 --> 01:14:03,903
Slight against the movie

1228
01:14:04,415 --> 01:14:10,559
Friday

1229
01:14:10,815 --> 01:14:12,095
Senior film called Shadow gay

1230
01:14:17,727 --> 01:14:20,287
They do their own you are absolutely

1231
01:14:29,247 --> 01:14:33,343
And at worst Windows know about until she's been arrested

1232
01:14:34,879 --> 01:14:36,671
Charged with Family Violence

1233
01:14:39,743 --> 01:14:41,791
Looks like

1234
01:14:45,887 --> 01:14:48,959
Last thing she said is this guy wants to be on

1235
01:14:51,007 --> 01:14:52,031
He comes in

1236
01:14:56,383 --> 01:14:58,175
Has Rodger Stone

1237
01:14:58,687 --> 01:15:01,247
Rodger Stone

1238
01:15:02,015 --> 01:15:04,063
I like Rodger Beasley

1239
01:15:07,135 --> 01:15:08,159
When General Joe's

1240
01:15:17,631 --> 01:15:21,983
So

1241
01:15:22,239 --> 01:15:25,823
In the film

1242
01:15:26,335 --> 01:15:28,383
When you're in a film

1243
01:15:29,663 --> 01:15:31,455
Rodger Stone

1244
01:15:31,967 --> 01:15:33,759
Rodger

1245
01:15:41,695 --> 01:15:42,463
Running

1246
01:15:42,719 --> 01:15:46,047
Shadownet

1247
01:15:46,303 --> 01:15:47,839
It's a small part of it

1248
01:15:48,095 --> 01:15:48,607
It's not

1249
01:15:48,863 --> 01:15:54,239
I mean the actual rogerstone part is small essential credibility

1250
01:15:54,495 --> 01:15:58,079
Of one of the main

1251
01:15:58,335 --> 01:16:00,639
Repeat this is why Alex Jones is really weird

1252
01:16:01,151 --> 01:16:03,967
Because I can see what his thought process is

1253
01:16:05,247 --> 01:16:07,551
Okay yes this Patrick

1254
01:16:07,807 --> 01:16:08,575
Lie lie lie

1255
01:16:08,831 --> 01:16:11,903
About my friend Rodger Stone

1256
01:16:12,159 --> 01:16:15,999
I'm possibly in charge of this gigantic conspiracy

1257
01:16:17,535 --> 01:16:18,559
That's a lie

1258
01:16:19,327 --> 01:16:21,631
The rest of the stuff he's saying it's probably

1259
01:16:25,983 --> 01:16:27,007
The in-person Rock

1260
01:16:27,263 --> 01:16:30,335
Doesn't realize that it's still the Council of twelve

1261
01:16:30,591 --> 01:16:32,383
Yeah Bill Gates's

1262
01:16:32,895 --> 01:16:39,039
Yeah Alex doesn't see people like a it's it's almost like looking at every single thing

1263
01:16:39,295 --> 01:16:43,135
Completely unattached to other things

1264
01:16:43,391 --> 01:16:49,535
Like Deedee lying about Rodger doesn't implicate the truth or credibility

1265
01:16:49,791 --> 01:16:54,143
You should approach other statements with his lies are all a cart

1266
01:16:54,399 --> 01:16:55,679
Patrick

1267
01:16:56,447 --> 01:16:57,215
I guess so

1268
01:16:57,727 --> 01:17:01,055
I got annoyed every time he does that I know I'm like

1269
01:17:01,823 --> 01:17:03,615
Denial that like

1270
01:17:03,871 --> 01:17:05,663
Bababababa I'm not trying to distance

1271
01:17:07,455 --> 01:17:13,599
You are because you just said you not I'm not bragging but

1272
01:17:14,111 --> 01:17:17,439
I'm so annoyed that better

1273
01:17:18,975 --> 01:17:21,279
What are the things that I think is pretty interesting isn't notice

1274
01:17:23,583 --> 01:17:26,655
Rodger doesn't seem to be trying to solicit donations

1275
01:17:27,167 --> 01:17:29,215
On this episode which is

1276
01:17:29,471 --> 01:17:35,359
Interesting because that Sunday Monday Rodger dropped his appeal.

1277
01:17:35,615 --> 01:17:38,943
It doesn't come up also

1278
01:17:39,199 --> 01:17:40,479
Why would have never happened

1279
01:17:40,735 --> 01:17:43,039
No but I'm previous episodes

1280
01:17:44,063 --> 01:17:46,623
Indy shadowgate documentary

1281
01:17:46,879 --> 01:17:48,415
It discussed tell Rodger stones

1282
01:17:48,671 --> 01:17:53,535
PO is going to be the thing that brings down the Deep State I've Salinas Rodger was so

1283
01:17:53,791 --> 01:17:54,303
Clearly

1284
01:17:54,559 --> 01:17:55,583
And so

1285
01:17:55,839 --> 01:17:57,887
Obviously wrongly tried

1286
01:17:58,399 --> 01:18:04,543
It would be the easiest thing in the world for them to appeal this case it was going to go through was going to expose ever

1287
01:18:04,799 --> 01:18:05,311
Everybody

1288
01:18:05,567 --> 01:18:07,103
Hell or high water

1289
01:18:07,615 --> 01:18:10,431
Nothing was going to stop Rodger now and I'm sure that the

1290
01:18:10,687 --> 01:18:16,831
Dropping of the appeal had nothing to do with what happened on Tuesday when the Senate Intel report was released which game

1291
01:18:17,343 --> 01:18:21,439
So many more instances of Rodger Stone in contact with the

1292
01:18:21,695 --> 01:18:22,207
Russian

1293
01:18:22,463 --> 01:18:23,487
Apparatchiks

1294
01:18:23,743 --> 01:18:25,023
If you will

1295
01:18:26,303 --> 01:18:28,863
The appeal would have done it short

1296
01:18:29,375 --> 01:18:35,007
Today there's a lot more evidence even further against today

1297
01:18:35,263 --> 01:18:36,287
Descendants

1298
01:18:36,799 --> 01:18:42,943
I didn't see this today

1299
01:18:43,199 --> 01:18:45,247
And it's kind of to the point where the evidence looks

1300
01:18:45,503 --> 01:18:46,015
Is though

1301
01:18:46,527 --> 01:18:47,807
If you wanted to

1302
01:18:48,063 --> 01:18:50,879
You might be able to bring a new charge account

1303
01:18:51,647 --> 01:18:54,207
I'm going to drop that a piano

1304
01:18:57,023 --> 01:18:58,047
Suspicious

1305
01:18:58,303 --> 01:18:59,583
Barry Easter egg

1306
01:18:59,839 --> 01:19:01,119
If I were Alex

1307
01:19:01,375 --> 01:19:07,519
Sure I would be so conflicted right now cuz I'm the one hand I got this Millie's at

1308
01:19:07,775 --> 01:19:09,823
Screwed

1309
01:19:10,335 --> 01:19:15,967
Documentary is trying to try to use me

1310
01:19:16,223 --> 01:19:20,575
He's making me feel kind of policeman and I can't just get rid of them because he's attached to me

1311
01:19:20,831 --> 01:19:26,975
Yeah I can't completely without attacking the documentary

1312
01:19:27,231 --> 01:19:29,279
Get my employee was not my employee out of prison

1313
01:19:29,535 --> 01:19:30,047
Never met her before

1314
01:19:30,303 --> 01:19:36,447
This is complicated now at the same time is going to be

1315
01:19:36,703 --> 01:19:42,079
Needs to commuted sentence because he's totally guilty and I don't want him in prison because he's effective

1316
01:19:42,335 --> 01:19:46,431
But because he was wrongly

1317
01:19:48,735 --> 01:19:49,503
Prison

1318
01:19:50,527 --> 01:19:56,671
He doesn't to Pardon him he just needs to commute the sentence so he doesn't die in prison

1319
01:19:57,183 --> 01:19:58,719
Of course now the appeals drop

1320
01:19:58,975 --> 01:19:59,999
What the f*** like

1321
01:20:05,631 --> 01:20:06,143
Just because

1322
01:20:06,399 --> 01:20:10,751
Set on all sides by people he previously trusted to be competent

1323
01:20:11,007 --> 01:20:11,519
Incorrect

1324
01:20:12,543 --> 01:20:18,688
Millie's whole thing would be totally fine

1325
01:20:18,944 --> 01:20:24,576
That's not a competency

1326
01:20:25,088 --> 01:20:31,232
Crying issue this is like a heist movie where Alex is playing the the ocean part and then

1327
01:20:31,488 --> 01:20:35,584
Millie is one of the bumbling idiot ew in the middle of of a heist

1328
01:20:35,840 --> 01:20:40,960
You know what I say

1329
01:20:41,216 --> 01:20:41,984
Think they need was

1330
01:20:42,752 --> 01:20:45,056
Number that song

1331
01:20:45,312 --> 01:20:49,152
Shadowgate

1332
01:20:49,408 --> 01:20:51,712
Hiring better people

1333
01:20:52,992 --> 01:20:55,296
Touch with somebody who can help him out with that

1334
01:20:55,552 --> 01:20:58,368
Human Resources problem

1335
01:20:59,392 --> 01:21:04,000
Couple bad hires

1336
01:21:04,256 --> 01:21:05,024
Seriously

1337
01:21:06,304 --> 01:21:12,448
If I were him I would be pretty f****** pissed off at just about everybody

1338
01:21:21,152 --> 01:21:21,920
Check out

1339
01:21:24,736 --> 01:21:28,320
Begin right

1340
01:21:29,344 --> 01:21:30,624
Let's throw a party

1341
01:21:32,160 --> 01:21:34,208
Eastpointe on Sunday

1342
01:21:34,976 --> 01:21:36,512
Alex has to

1343
01:21:36,768 --> 01:21:40,352
Kind of figure out a way to thread the needle because he's like okay

1344
01:21:41,120 --> 01:21:45,472
She didn't get arrested because of anything in the documentary but you did get arrested

1345
01:21:45,728 --> 01:21:47,520
Patrick bergey was in Austin which is

1346
01:21:47,776 --> 01:21:48,544
F****** weird

1347
01:21:48,800 --> 01:21:49,568
He showed up

1348
01:21:50,336 --> 01:21:50,848
Dick

1349
01:21:51,104 --> 01:21:52,384
Way

1350
01:21:52,896 --> 01:21:53,408
Hi

1351
01:21:53,664 --> 01:21:54,176
You know what

1352
01:21:55,200 --> 01:21:56,736
I think this is a psyop against

1353
01:21:56,992 --> 01:21:57,504
Me

1354
01:21:58,016 --> 01:21:59,552
Friday

1355
01:21:59,808 --> 01:22:01,344
She gets arrested in Ohio

1356
01:22:01,856 --> 01:22:04,416
The police are very unprofessional

1357
01:22:11,328 --> 01:22:14,144
Lego hey

1358
01:22:14,912 --> 01:22:15,936
Wow at my door

1359
01:22:17,984 --> 01:22:19,776
I guess if you know what's going on with you want

1360
01:22:20,032 --> 01:22:22,336
Rodger stone is the Kingpin

1361
01:22:22,848 --> 01:22:23,360
So

1362
01:22:24,384 --> 01:22:26,688
Something make me think

1363
01:22:27,968 --> 01:22:28,480
This is done

1364
01:22:28,992 --> 01:22:30,784
Millie's a good person a good mom

1365
01:22:31,040 --> 01:22:31,552
Okay

1366
01:22:31,808 --> 01:22:33,088
You got two children they win

1367
01:22:33,344 --> 01:22:35,136
CVS

1368
01:22:36,672 --> 01:22:38,208
At 11 a.m.

1369
01:22:38,720 --> 01:22:41,024
Over an argument with her mom and broken cell phone

1370
01:22:41,280 --> 01:22:44,096
Three months ago where Mom admits that so I don't know why

1371
01:22:44,352 --> 01:22:46,400
They're grabbing Emma doing this other than

1372
01:22:46,912 --> 01:22:48,704
They may have been conned by the Deep state

1373
01:22:55,616 --> 01:22:57,152
Will show you the pill

1374
01:23:00,992 --> 01:23:01,504
Microphone

1375
01:23:02,016 --> 01:23:04,064
Police Department

1376
01:23:04,320 --> 01:23:05,088
Pipe it up

1377
01:23:06,368 --> 01:23:08,928
Maybe it's a coincidence okay

1378
01:23:10,464 --> 01:23:13,280
Now Alex is presenting

1379
01:23:13,792 --> 01:23:18,656
We were going to release the film until bergey was there because it's

1380
01:23:18,912 --> 01:23:19,424
The setup

1381
01:23:19,680 --> 01:23:22,240
For him to be like it's all about Rodger huh

1382
01:23:22,496 --> 01:23:23,520
I just can't believe that this

1383
01:23:23,776 --> 01:23:24,544
Come back to

1384
01:23:24,800 --> 01:23:26,080
Being entirely about him

1385
01:23:29,664 --> 01:23:30,176
You're wrong

1386
01:23:30,688 --> 01:23:33,248
I understand why you would think that because it does sound that way

1387
01:23:33,760 --> 01:23:35,552
It's not all about Alex

1388
01:23:35,808 --> 01:23:37,856
Mostly about Rodger

1389
01:23:38,112 --> 01:23:39,904
But that's also about Alex also

1390
01:23:41,696 --> 01:23:43,232
I do like the idea that Alex is like

1391
01:23:44,768 --> 01:23:48,352
Ifucking got screwed on this probably about I got screwed

1392
01:23:48,608 --> 01:23:50,144
It's a really interesting

1393
01:23:50,400 --> 01:23:51,168
Character

1394
01:23:51,680 --> 01:23:57,312
Style

1395
01:23:57,824 --> 01:23:59,872
Is confused on how to play the victim

1396
01:24:00,384 --> 01:24:03,456
Because there's that there's some pride involved

1397
01:24:03,712 --> 01:24:04,992
There's some confusion

1398
01:24:05,760 --> 01:24:09,088
I think Alex is totally fine

1399
01:24:09,344 --> 01:24:10,880
Trump said about me

1400
01:24:11,392 --> 01:24:14,720
Your reputation is amazing I will not let you or your audience down

1401
01:24:15,232 --> 01:24:16,000
He was,

1402
01:24:17,024 --> 01:24:17,792
Because of Rodger Stone

1403
01:24:20,864 --> 01:24:22,912
We have the president endorsements

1404
01:24:23,168 --> 01:24:26,496
But we're not trustworthy according to the internet operation

1405
01:24:28,544 --> 01:24:30,080
Messages Keith

1406
01:24:30,336 --> 01:24:31,872
Which swing state

1407
01:24:32,128 --> 01:24:33,664
Continually

1408
01:24:40,320 --> 01:24:41,600
Wake up and we're the Bad Guys

1409
01:24:42,624 --> 01:24:44,928
I've been totally Trump

1410
01:24:45,440 --> 01:24:48,256
I mean I really think about that

1411
01:24:52,864 --> 01:24:53,888
Whoever ran this

1412
01:24:54,144 --> 01:24:56,448
Did you do all this and get her arrested

1413
01:24:56,704 --> 01:24:58,240
What was Operation was happening

1414
01:24:59,264 --> 01:25:00,032
Full push

1415
01:25:00,288 --> 01:25:02,080
You buddy they really don't like you

1416
01:25:02,336 --> 01:25:03,360
Talking to Rodger

1417
01:25:03,616 --> 01:25:08,480
This is interesting to see how this sort of rationalization happens on the

1418
01:25:08,736 --> 01:25:11,040
The fly you know I don't like him understanding

1419
01:25:11,808 --> 01:25:13,088
I don't like

1420
01:25:13,344 --> 01:25:15,904
He's getting punched by so many people all the time

1421
01:25:16,160 --> 01:25:16,928
But it's

1422
01:25:17,184 --> 01:25:18,720
It's he's calling himself

1423
01:25:18,976 --> 01:25:25,120
Of course this is cuz it's elaborate it's not just you hang out with

1424
01:25:25,632 --> 01:25:26,912
F****** Desi weirdos

1425
01:25:27,168 --> 01:25:32,032
You have no standard of who you trust as experts

1426
01:25:32,288 --> 01:25:33,568
Employees or contractors

1427
01:25:34,080 --> 01:25:35,360
Emphasis what happens

1428
01:25:35,616 --> 01:25:36,384
Sometimes

1429
01:25:36,896 --> 01:25:38,944
Yet end up with some Rogue actors

1430
01:25:39,200 --> 01:25:40,480
Slipping through

1431
01:25:40,736 --> 01:25:46,368
Somebody like Millie is dumb enough to listen to one of these people nice okay awesome.

1432
01:25:48,160 --> 01:25:49,696
Understand

1433
01:25:49,952 --> 01:25:55,328
No it's a secret globalist

1434
01:25:58,912 --> 01:25:59,424
It's a circle

1435
01:25:59,680 --> 01:26:05,824
She was better if her job she would have known not to listen to these people

1436
01:26:06,080 --> 01:26:08,640
Red flag gone up when she realized she couldn't

1437
01:26:09,152 --> 01:26:13,760
Verify that the documentary that you

1438
01:26:14,016 --> 01:26:19,392
Sponsored and gave them free editorial control over

1439
01:26:19,648 --> 01:26:22,720
Cuz you were the sponsor of it you wanted to make sure it was up to your standard

1440
01:26:23,488 --> 01:26:24,768
Or you don't have any

1441
01:26:25,536 --> 01:26:26,304
Drop it on the floor

1442
01:26:27,584 --> 01:26:28,608
Who gives a s***

1443
01:26:28,864 --> 01:26:31,936
So Alex really has to clarify

1444
01:26:32,192 --> 01:26:33,728
Interesting

1445
01:26:34,240 --> 01:26:35,264
Clarification

1446
01:26:35,776 --> 01:26:36,800
And that is again

1447
01:26:37,824 --> 01:26:39,872
Cuz one of the people in this documentary is an a******

1448
01:26:40,128 --> 01:26:40,896
It doesn't mean it's not all

1449
01:26:41,664 --> 01:26:44,224
Your house Alex Jones

1450
01:26:44,736 --> 01:26:45,760
The fact that I was a rock

1451
01:26:46,016 --> 01:26:46,528
Earlier

1452
01:26:46,784 --> 01:26:48,832
Criticizing one of the people in the

1453
01:26:52,160 --> 01:26:53,184
That Millie Weaver

1454
01:26:55,488 --> 01:26:58,048
Was somebody in the Fillmore District

1455
01:26:58,304 --> 01:27:00,096
Film

1456
01:27:00,608 --> 01:27:01,120
Shadow game

1457
01:27:03,936 --> 01:27:07,264
Dad she got arrested with her husband and her husband's brother in Ohio

1458
01:27:07,776 --> 01:27:08,800
Believer

1459
01:27:11,104 --> 01:27:12,128
It was original complaint

1460
01:27:13,152 --> 01:27:13,664
There are they

1461
01:27:15,968 --> 01:27:17,504
Again he's got the brother thing wrong

1462
01:27:18,016 --> 01:27:21,344
I don't understand how you can be like

1463
01:27:21,856 --> 01:27:24,928
The information flow documentary

1464
01:27:25,184 --> 01:27:25,952
Is a dick

1465
01:27:26,208 --> 01:27:28,256
A liar someone I don't trust it all

1466
01:27:28,768 --> 01:27:29,792
Was good

1467
01:27:30,816 --> 01:27:31,840
I don't understand that.

1468
01:27:32,096 --> 01:27:33,376
I think if somebody were to

1469
01:27:33,888 --> 01:27:35,168
Watch one of Alex's

1470
01:27:36,448 --> 01:27:37,472
And pick out a talking head

1471
01:27:45,408 --> 01:27:49,760
You know I think if you know it that's just one thing I'm sure he still thinks the documentary

1472
01:27:50,272 --> 01:27:56,416
I don't know

1473
01:27:56,672 --> 01:27:58,208
Also

1474
01:27:58,464 --> 01:27:59,744
From what I've seen

1475
01:28:00,768 --> 01:28:05,888
The thing that he's talking about with Millie's mom coming out and saying that you wanted the charges dropped

1476
01:28:06,400 --> 01:28:08,192
Apparently somebody

1477
01:28:08,448 --> 01:28:11,520
Who had meli's mom as a screen

1478
01:28:11,776 --> 01:28:13,568
Who left like a YouTube comment

1479
01:28:13,824 --> 01:28:14,592
It said that

1480
01:28:14,848 --> 01:28:17,152
There's no verification that it was actually her mom

1481
01:28:17,408 --> 01:28:19,456
It is that fast how the internet works

1482
01:28:19,712 --> 01:28:25,856
Baie

1483
01:28:26,112 --> 01:28:31,232
Confirmed or any from her

1484
01:28:31,488 --> 01:28:37,632
Except YouTube comments

1485
01:28:37,888 --> 01:28:40,704
Taking that as like fully confirm gospel

1486
01:28:40,960 --> 01:28:41,728
Also not good

1487
01:28:41,984 --> 01:28:42,496
If it were me

1488
01:28:42,752 --> 01:28:43,264
I would

1489
01:28:43,520 --> 01:28:44,800
Play my handle

1490
01:28:45,056 --> 01:28:45,824
Would not be

1491
01:28:46,592 --> 01:28:48,128
Ownership of

1492
01:28:49,408 --> 01:28:51,712
Parent Parenthood towards the person that just pizza

1493
01:28:51,968 --> 01:28:52,992
The s*** out of it

1494
01:28:53,760 --> 01:28:55,552
I think if I were Alex

1495
01:28:55,808 --> 01:28:57,344
I would probably have cut bait

1496
01:28:57,600 --> 01:28:59,136
Like I think the

1497
01:28:59,392 --> 01:29:00,416
You've already said that you don't need

1498
01:29:02,208 --> 01:29:02,720
I mean like

1499
01:29:02,976 --> 01:29:05,280
Once you're already embarking down the road

1500
01:29:05,536 --> 01:29:09,376
She's just a contractor she does work I pay or sometimes

1501
01:29:09,632 --> 01:29:11,680
Like why even muddy the waters

1502
01:29:11,936 --> 01:29:16,288
Why you try to salvage something here

1503
01:29:17,056 --> 01:29:19,872
You know like I put eight years into the truth

1504
01:29:20,128 --> 01:29:23,712
1/8 years he's he's got his Bilter up his parts

1505
01:29:23,968 --> 01:29:27,040
I guess I think that she probably

1506
01:29:27,296 --> 01:29:28,064
Might have

1507
01:29:28,320 --> 01:29:31,648
Some embarrassing things to say

1508
01:29:31,904 --> 01:29:32,672
The NBA

1509
01:29:32,928 --> 01:29:37,536
Is strong with contract

1510
01:29:37,792 --> 01:29:42,400
Allegedly

1511
01:29:42,656 --> 01:29:46,752
Devon lights

1512
01:29:47,520 --> 01:29:51,616
So I'll accept the process information

1513
01:29:53,152 --> 01:29:55,456
Is there's only one conclusion you can come too

1514
01:29:55,712 --> 01:29:57,248
No he's a great person

1515
01:29:57,504 --> 01:29:59,808
But I think there's a psyop

1516
01:30:02,624 --> 01:30:03,648
Teaser

1517
01:30:03,904 --> 01:30:04,672
Here

1518
01:30:04,928 --> 01:30:05,440
Is a brain teaser

1519
01:30:06,464 --> 01:30:06,976
Is she

1520
01:30:07,488 --> 01:30:12,352
I don't know if I don't know I'm looking for

1521
01:30:12,608 --> 01:30:14,144
She got released on her own recognizance

1522
01:30:14,400 --> 01:30:19,264
The show on Monday

1523
01:30:19,776 --> 01:30:25,920
The documentary put me a bit behind

1524
01:30:26,688 --> 01:30:29,248
And I was laughing too hard let's get you Friday

1525
01:30:29,504 --> 01:30:31,552
Saturday and Sunday

1526
01:30:34,368 --> 01:30:34,880
David buddy

1527
01:30:35,392 --> 01:30:38,208
So at this point on Sunday Alex's Torreon

1528
01:30:38,464 --> 01:30:44,608
The Whirlwind of a weekend

1529
01:30:44,864 --> 01:30:49,728
Anyways recharge my batteries about Alex

1530
01:30:49,984 --> 01:30:56,128
Show my batteries

1531
01:30:57,664 --> 01:31:00,992
Already well

1532
01:31:01,248 --> 01:31:05,600
But I really enjoy

1533
01:31:05,856 --> 01:31:06,624
Now your life

1534
01:31:06,880 --> 01:31:13,024
Apparently Billy beat up her mom

1535
01:31:13,280 --> 01:31:17,888
Weirdo to his Studio Diaries play me

1536
01:31:19,936 --> 01:31:20,704
What song

1537
01:31:21,216 --> 01:31:25,056
So he have Tori in studio or on the phone excuse me now and

1538
01:31:25,824 --> 01:31:27,104
We've already heard

1539
01:31:27,360 --> 01:31:28,384
From Alex

1540
01:31:28,640 --> 01:31:30,688
That the documentary was supposed to come out

1541
01:31:30,944 --> 01:31:32,992
On Thursday

1542
01:31:33,504 --> 01:31:34,272
And we've heard from Pat

1543
01:31:34,528 --> 01:31:35,808
Bergita

1544
01:31:36,064 --> 01:31:36,576
Supposed to come out

1545
01:31:36,832 --> 01:31:37,600
Future Funk

1546
01:31:37,856 --> 01:31:40,928
1-day yes she has another story

1547
01:31:44,768 --> 01:31:45,280
Film

1548
01:31:49,120 --> 01:31:50,912
The film gets released their arrested

1549
01:31:51,168 --> 01:31:54,752
I do to my office saying rogerstone masterminds everything with no proof

1550
01:31:58,592 --> 01:32:00,896
I can't even begin to figure this out

1551
01:32:01,920 --> 01:32:04,736
Is very bizarre here's what's even more bizarre

1552
01:32:04,992 --> 01:32:06,016
So I spoke

1553
01:32:09,088 --> 01:32:10,624
On the telephone

1554
01:32:16,000 --> 01:32:19,328
July 20th July 20th

1555
01:32:19,584 --> 01:32:25,728
The grand jury returned in July

1556
01:32:25,984 --> 01:32:29,056
Original release date

1557
01:32:30,592 --> 01:32:31,104
Alright

1558
01:32:31,872 --> 01:32:33,920
Wow

1559
01:32:34,176 --> 01:32:38,016
Who I need a little bit like Alex is struggling to figure out what they think

1560
01:32:38,272 --> 01:32:43,648
Is going on a completely new element to this is going to make it very easy

1561
01:32:43,904 --> 01:32:44,928
Thanks

1562
01:32:45,184 --> 01:32:48,000
I think Alex is still struggling because

1563
01:32:48,512 --> 01:32:53,632
Did the content of the documentary and the singer John Brennan and

1564
01:32:53,888 --> 01:32:54,656
Little bean like

1565
01:32:54,912 --> 01:32:57,984
Oh yeah all the media is all lies

1566
01:32:58,240 --> 01:32:59,520
All that is so good

1567
01:32:59,776 --> 01:33:01,312
For him and he likes it

1568
01:33:01,824 --> 01:33:02,592
We also

1569
01:33:03,104 --> 01:33:04,128
Fucken hates

1570
01:33:04,384 --> 01:33:05,408
Patrick bergey

1571
01:33:05,664 --> 01:33:11,296
Tori is a lady that has the show with Millie Weaver who was arrested she was releasing a

1572
01:33:11,808 --> 01:33:12,320
Online doctor

1573
01:33:25,120 --> 01:33:25,632
Okay

1574
01:33:26,144 --> 01:33:27,936
Here's here's my pitched

1575
01:33:28,192 --> 01:33:30,752
Everybody has gone wrong

1576
01:33:31,776 --> 01:33:34,592
They think lawyers and s*** like that are going to keep them in line

1577
01:33:35,104 --> 01:33:37,920
Do you know what you should have done do you know what you do your trick out

1578
01:33:38,432 --> 01:33:40,736
Do you want to avoid him doing the Sandy Hooks

1579
01:33:41,248 --> 01:33:41,760
Guess what

1580
01:33:42,016 --> 01:33:43,552
To do you find somebody who's there

1581
01:33:43,808 --> 01:33:44,576
Conspiracy theorist

1582
01:33:44,832 --> 01:33:48,416
You pay them to be Petty and annoying Alex perfect he'll be like

1583
01:33:48,672 --> 01:33:49,696
That Sandy Hook

1584
01:33:49,952 --> 01:33:56,096
Make it make it personal so he takes a

1585
01:33:58,912 --> 01:34:05,056
You can pick you could manipulate her maybe but doing whatever you want but I think this is actually ever

1586
01:34:05,312 --> 01:34:11,456
Evidence to the contrary cuz he still stays

1587
01:34:11,712 --> 01:34:13,760
Maybe maybe not maybe they wouldn't work at all

1588
01:34:14,272 --> 01:34:16,576
Maybe he has such a

1589
01:34:17,088 --> 01:34:17,856
F****** stupid

1590
01:34:19,136 --> 01:34:20,928
So Alec suggest that

1591
01:34:21,184 --> 01:34:24,512
The film was released after the arrest intentionally

1592
01:34:26,048 --> 01:34:28,608
True

1593
01:34:32,448 --> 01:34:34,240
No that's that's not what's going on

1594
01:34:35,776 --> 01:34:36,800
Amazon for a while they were just

1595
01:34:38,080 --> 01:34:39,104
Weather

1596
01:34:39,360 --> 01:34:40,384
The arrest finally got it

1597
01:34:41,408 --> 01:34:47,552
Yeah I would say that maybe the film was done for a while and then this was the best opportune moment for them to

1598
01:34:47,808 --> 01:34:51,648
To suggest that it was because of his arrest

1599
01:34:51,904 --> 01:34:53,952
They must have been

1600
01:34:54,720 --> 01:34:55,488
A little bit of them

1601
01:34:56,512 --> 01:34:57,792
This is an opportunity

1602
01:34:58,304 --> 01:35:04,448
Totally a whole lot of coincidences going on because I find it hard to believe that without any evidence that I had to

1603
01:35:04,704 --> 01:35:05,472
Time they would know

1604
01:35:05,984 --> 01:35:07,520
Like the date that they were going

1605
01:35:07,776 --> 01:35:12,384
Macomb execution warrant because Patrick bergey being in Austin

1606
01:35:12,640 --> 01:35:15,968
If you imagine that that was part of a setup

1607
01:35:16,224 --> 01:35:22,112
Yeah that is too much for me to believe

1608
01:35:22,368 --> 01:35:26,464
A clear opportunism General Vibe on this

1609
01:35:27,744 --> 01:35:29,024
Iida I think Alex

1610
01:35:29,280 --> 01:35:35,424
He's probably telling the truth in this case because he has no idea

1611
01:35:35,680 --> 01:35:38,240
The same time supporting them

1612
01:35:38,496 --> 01:35:39,776
He's in a weird like

1613
01:35:40,800 --> 01:35:42,592
Tell the truth I don't know what's happening

1614
01:35:42,848 --> 01:35:46,176
And so it would make sense to me that they had finished it

1615
01:35:46,432 --> 01:35:47,712
And they were just taking rad

1616
01:35:48,480 --> 01:35:54,624
Which I think that's generous I think it was

1617
01:35:54,880 --> 01:35:55,648
82

1618
01:35:57,952 --> 01:35:58,464
Sucks

1619
01:35:58,720 --> 01:35:59,232
Editing

1620
01:35:59,488 --> 01:36:00,000
Maybe I don't know

1621
01:36:00,256 --> 01:36:04,096
Arrested in somebody a few hours and then like

1622
01:36:04,352 --> 01:36:05,376
A few hours later they like

1623
01:36:05,632 --> 01:36:07,936
This is the best possible time to do this

1624
01:36:08,192 --> 01:36:08,960
So drop it

1625
01:36:09,216 --> 01:36:10,496
Sartori

1626
01:36:10,752 --> 01:36:13,056
Giochinos has been arrests

1627
01:36:13,312 --> 01:36:17,152
And so we got to deal with that turns out you can get arrested for

1628
01:36:17,408 --> 01:36:17,920
Anybody

1629
01:36:18,176 --> 01:36:19,712
Anyone arrested

1630
01:36:22,016 --> 01:36:27,136
One person's words to Alex if I want to I can go down to my local police

1631
01:36:35,072 --> 01:36:36,864
This all the time

1632
01:36:37,120 --> 01:36:38,400
Fighting our cell phone broke

1633
01:36:38,656 --> 01:36:39,680
3 months ago

1634
01:36:40,960 --> 01:36:41,728
It wasn't even a fight

1635
01:36:42,496 --> 01:36:44,288
It was the second time they caught her

1636
01:36:44,544 --> 01:36:45,312
Recording

1637
01:36:46,848 --> 01:36:52,992
Documents and serial numbers in computers and logs

1638
01:37:02,720 --> 01:37:05,024
What I love about that

1639
01:37:07,072 --> 01:37:11,168
I love two things about that the first is Alex's just like the responses hilarious

1640
01:37:11,936 --> 01:37:13,728
And the second thing is

1641
01:37:13,984 --> 01:37:20,128
You got the response to Tori saying something that he himself said that video he put out on Saturday

1642
01:37:24,224 --> 01:37:26,016
That's weird that's very weird

1643
01:37:26,784 --> 01:37:32,928
So Tori as a new detail about the Iraq

1644
01:37:33,184 --> 01:37:37,536
Wasn't in the video at all but apparently

1645
01:37:39,072 --> 01:37:41,376
The power was cut from the house

1646
01:37:42,400 --> 01:37:48,544
I was I was riding

1647
01:37:48,800 --> 01:37:50,848
Where it's at on the network

1648
01:37:51,104 --> 01:37:51,616
Spanish

1649
01:37:53,664 --> 01:37:54,944
60%

1650
01:37:55,200 --> 01:37:56,224
10 minutes later

1651
01:37:56,480 --> 01:37:58,016
They were rested their power was

1652
01:37:59,552 --> 01:38:00,320
Power Wheel

1653
01:38:00,576 --> 01:38:03,392
So there's a lot more power was cut

1654
01:38:03,648 --> 01:38:05,952
So this isn't about just arresting people

1655
01:38:06,208 --> 01:38:08,512
And I know there's going to be a cop for me tonight

1656
01:38:08,768 --> 01:38:10,048
They cut the power that's huge

1657
01:38:10,304 --> 01:38:10,816
Interior

1658
01:38:12,352 --> 01:38:14,144
What's their evidence for the power bank

1659
01:38:14,400 --> 01:38:15,680
I'm not sure

1660
01:38:15,936 --> 01:38:17,728
Tories side it stopped

1661
01:38:18,240 --> 01:38:18,752
Uploading

1662
01:38:21,056 --> 01:38:23,104
Because she got the stopped uploading

1663
01:38:24,640 --> 01:38:27,712
I don't know but it is to convince Alex or something

1664
01:38:27,968 --> 01:38:30,784
Now this is my favorite thing from Tori's.

1665
01:38:32,064 --> 01:38:37,696
The two of them she's able to smooth over Alex a little bit on the Rodger Stone stuff

1666
01:38:37,952 --> 01:38:39,488
I love Rodger Gray

1667
01:38:39,744 --> 01:38:43,584
I am at she's trying to explain to Alex that that's like

1668
01:38:43,840 --> 01:38:45,888
His whole version of it like

1669
01:38:47,168 --> 01:38:50,496
Birdie says that Rogers masterminding everything show

1670
01:38:52,032 --> 01:38:53,824
It's not what he said of a documentary Alex

1671
01:38:54,336 --> 01:38:56,896
It's a confusing back-and-forth between them

1672
01:38:57,152 --> 01:39:01,504
But she's able to make everything fine by being like the best

1673
01:39:01,760 --> 01:39:02,784
Article

1674
01:39:03,040 --> 01:39:03,552
Alright

1675
01:39:04,064 --> 01:39:06,112
Unfortunately date falls apart a little bit

1676
01:39:06,368 --> 01:39:06,880
When

1677
01:39:07,136 --> 01:39:08,160
Restart

1678
01:39:08,416 --> 01:39:09,440
Explain her feelings

1679
01:39:09,696 --> 01:39:10,464
About Edward Snowden

1680
01:39:10,976 --> 01:39:11,744
Oh no

1681
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:12,512
Alex

1682
01:39:13,280 --> 01:39:15,328
Doesn't quite like what she has to

1683
01:39:15,584 --> 01:39:16,608
To say this is really a

1684
01:39:17,120 --> 01:39:20,448
We can disagree on that Julian Assange is not in the same boat

1685
01:39:22,496 --> 01:39:23,264
Caused

1686
01:39:23,520 --> 01:39:24,544
Creative

1687
01:39:24,800 --> 01:39:27,872
Windstream

1688
01:39:28,384 --> 01:39:29,664
Over-the-year up-to-date

1689
01:39:30,432 --> 01:39:34,784
The only reason he bristled blue is because he realized he was

1690
01:39:39,136 --> 01:39:43,232
As the song pure

1691
01:39:45,792 --> 01:39:48,096
Get immunity

1692
01:39:48,608 --> 01:39:50,912
Exactly

1693
01:39:53,472 --> 01:39:54,240
Okay because

1694
01:39:54,752 --> 01:40:00,896
Those opposed receive Communications from people that are

1695
01:40:05,760 --> 01:40:10,112
Do you think about snow

1696
01:40:10,368 --> 01:40:12,672
The thing is maybe we can

1697
01:40:13,952 --> 01:40:15,488
Fingers cuz he was registered

1698
01:40:16,512 --> 01:40:19,840
Snowden

1699
01:40:20,096 --> 01:40:21,120
Whistleblower protection

1700
01:40:21,376 --> 01:40:22,144
She does

1701
01:40:24,448 --> 01:40:25,984
Their payroll

1702
01:40:27,776 --> 01:40:31,872
Snowden has been good

1703
01:40:32,128 --> 01:40:37,248
Perfume

1704
01:40:38,272 --> 01:40:41,088
Glorified

1705
01:40:45,184 --> 01:40:47,488
Reinforces

1706
01:40:47,744 --> 01:40:48,768
Every single piece of data

1707
01:40:50,304 --> 01:40:51,584
Pictures whatever you want

1708
01:40:51,840 --> 01:40:54,144
How's it going to say is shipped

1709
01:40:56,192 --> 01:40:57,472
Let's be clear on what he did

1710
01:41:01,568 --> 01:41:05,408
Verizon

1711
01:41:07,200 --> 01:41:09,248
He controlled all architecture to put everything overseas

1712
01:41:09,504 --> 01:41:12,576
Don't ask you to Quest architectural

1713
01:41:13,088 --> 01:41:16,928
So don't do this

1714
01:41:17,440 --> 01:41:21,024
Brennan did that in 2003 with Saudis

1715
01:41:21,280 --> 01:41:22,048
Sandburg

1716
01:41:29,728 --> 01:41:34,080
I don't know I don't know

1717
01:41:34,592 --> 01:41:35,104
Did you see him there

1718
01:41:37,664 --> 01:41:38,944
So now we have discredited

1719
01:41:39,200 --> 01:41:41,248
The other voice other documents

1720
01:41:41,504 --> 01:41:44,064
Elsa

1721
01:41:46,368 --> 01:41:52,512
Still great documentary documentary I have some serious problems with both

1722
01:41:52,768 --> 01:41:56,608
Of the people that buy non-employee talk to but

1723
01:41:56,864 --> 01:41:57,376
Jerry

1724
01:41:57,632 --> 01:42:03,776
Why would they do you say that

1725
01:42:04,032 --> 01:42:10,176
I don't understand why anyone would act that way the problem with that is that means

1726
01:42:10,432 --> 01:42:11,712
What is capable

1727
01:42:11,968 --> 01:42:14,272
Oh yeah

1728
01:42:14,528 --> 01:42:18,624
All the other interactions videos suspect

1729
01:42:18,880 --> 01:42:21,952
Least a little bit and and I rarely see pushback

1730
01:42:22,208 --> 01:42:24,000
And the fact that I was pushing back

1731
01:42:24,512 --> 01:42:27,584
Is not a good sign for these folks

1732
01:42:27,840 --> 01:42:31,168
Highly doubt it

1733
01:42:31,680 --> 01:42:32,448
You know

1734
01:42:32,704 --> 01:42:37,056
It's a really interesting position to be in because you know I watch

1735
01:42:37,312 --> 01:42:37,824
Shadowgate

1736
01:42:38,848 --> 01:42:40,128
I looked into these folks

1737
01:42:40,384 --> 01:42:42,688
I found them to not

1738
01:42:43,712 --> 01:42:44,736
Certain tests

1739
01:42:44,992 --> 01:42:45,504
But I have

1740
01:42:45,760 --> 01:42:50,880
Credibility they didn't seem like people I would take their word on stuff

1741
01:42:51,136 --> 01:42:55,488
And it's really interesting that Alex and I are on the same page

1742
01:42:55,744 --> 01:42:59,840
Very rare it really is

1743
01:43:00,096 --> 01:43:01,120
Both of you

1744
01:43:01,376 --> 01:43:06,496
Exactly

1745
01:43:06,752 --> 01:43:12,896
Is pretty good

1746
01:43:13,152 --> 01:43:15,200
You are conclusions slightly different

1747
01:43:15,712 --> 01:43:16,736
Possibly bricks

1748
01:43:16,992 --> 01:43:18,016
Baby

1749
01:43:18,272 --> 01:43:18,784
Take it personally

1750
01:43:19,040 --> 01:43:20,832
No it's

1751
01:43:21,088 --> 01:43:25,440
You know by the end of Sunday's show you get the sense that he doesn't

1752
01:43:25,952 --> 01:43:28,512
One of them for sure

1753
01:43:29,024 --> 01:43:29,792
The other

1754
01:43:30,304 --> 01:43:33,632
Subtly signals

1755
01:43:34,912 --> 01:43:41,056
Will this last quick cure and the show ends of Alex distancing himself

1756
01:43:41,312 --> 01:43:44,384
Even further

1757
01:43:44,640 --> 01:43:48,224
Against himself and Rochester

1758
01:43:48,736 --> 01:43:50,016
Here's all I know

1759
01:43:56,672 --> 01:43:59,232
He says get something later contractors people iSpa

1760
01:44:00,256 --> 01:44:00,768
Whether it's

1761
01:44:01,536 --> 01:44:03,072
Paul Joseph Watson or weather

1762
01:44:03,328 --> 01:44:04,864
It's Millie Weaver weather

1763
01:44:05,888 --> 01:44:06,656
Weather in Hawaii

1764
01:44:06,912 --> 01:44:07,680
Content creator

1765
01:44:07,936 --> 01:44:08,448
Sports

1766
01:44:10,240 --> 01:44:11,264
Here is some support

1767
01:44:14,592 --> 01:44:15,616
I really thought about the mission

1768
01:44:21,248 --> 01:44:21,760
Film

1769
01:44:22,528 --> 01:44:23,296
Never saw it

1770
01:44:23,808 --> 01:44:26,624
I saw the trailer I wanted the film I wanted to promote it

1771
01:44:28,928 --> 01:44:30,720
She's arrested right when it's coming out

1772
01:44:31,488 --> 01:44:32,512
Do the tenants at my door

1773
01:44:35,584 --> 01:44:36,352
Rocket scientist

1774
01:44:39,168 --> 01:44:41,728
Well

1775
01:44:55,808 --> 01:45:00,160
I love God I love Jasmine I love you but I'm not running

1776
01:45:03,744 --> 01:45:06,048
Adora Dater

1777
01:45:07,072 --> 01:45:08,352
I just say something's going on

1778
01:45:09,120 --> 01:45:10,656
What it is

1779
01:45:12,192 --> 01:45:13,728
Who's good and who's bad

1780
01:45:14,240 --> 01:45:15,520
The bottom of it

1781
01:45:16,032 --> 01:45:19,104
For me whatever I find outs going on with us

1782
01:45:20,384 --> 01:45:22,432
I just got cute art stuff written all over it

1783
01:45:22,944 --> 01:45:25,504
I'm going to give you that information

1784
01:45:26,272 --> 01:45:29,344
I solved it

1785
01:45:29,856 --> 01:45:32,672
But I got a good idea what's going on

1786
01:45:33,952 --> 01:45:37,280
Brennan is just trying to sabotage our movement

1787
01:45:38,816 --> 01:45:39,328
No

1788
01:45:53,152 --> 01:45:54,176
Freedom and justice

1789
01:45:57,248 --> 01:45:58,784
David overall home

1790
01:46:03,392 --> 01:46:05,952
Shonettas mixtape

1791
01:46:06,208 --> 01:46:08,512
Just so you know everybody

1792
01:46:11,584 --> 01:46:16,960
Solve this mystery surround yourself with s*******

1793
01:46:17,728 --> 01:46:19,776
This is so much listening to

1794
01:46:20,288 --> 01:46:22,080
Two people on Project Camelot go

1795
01:46:22,336 --> 01:46:23,616
I think the grades are behind this

1796
01:46:23,872 --> 01:46:24,384
No no

1797
01:46:24,640 --> 01:46:25,152
I think the rapper

1798
01:46:25,920 --> 01:46:28,480
Exactly the same level of like

1799
01:46:28,736 --> 01:46:31,552
Fine fight it out amongst yourselves in the star

1800
01:46:31,808 --> 01:46:34,368
Neither of your answers will end up being correct

1801
01:46:35,136 --> 01:46:37,696
Tell Jordan there's something interesting that happened

1802
01:46:38,208 --> 01:46:43,584
Over the course of this weekend was the andaz Monday Tuesday rolled around

1803
01:46:44,608 --> 01:46:45,888
I noticed

1804
01:46:46,656 --> 01:46:47,680
Monday

1805
01:46:48,448 --> 01:46:48,960
Alex

1806
01:46:51,008 --> 01:46:52,544
Had his Saturday report

1807
01:46:52,800 --> 01:46:54,336
Where you talked about Melly

1808
01:46:54,592 --> 01:46:57,664
A video on his Alex Jones

1809
01:46:58,688 --> 01:47:00,736
He also had his Sunday broadcast

1810
01:47:07,392 --> 01:47:07,904
Now

1811
01:47:10,208 --> 01:47:12,000
And his Sunday show

1812
01:47:12,256 --> 01:47:12,768
Gone

1813
01:47:13,024 --> 01:47:15,840
They're gone from Bayside radio.

1814
01:47:16,352 --> 01:47:18,656
They are not in the

1815
01:47:18,912 --> 01:47:19,424
Thread

1816
01:47:19,680 --> 01:47:21,728
I'm looking at it right here

1817
01:47:21,984 --> 01:47:23,776
They have a video of Rodger Stone

1818
01:47:24,032 --> 01:47:30,176
Talking about Trump's brother tonight's celebrate in the

1819
01:47:30,432 --> 01:47:33,504
Nba.com

1820
01:47:33,760 --> 01:47:34,784
In the spring

1821
01:47:35,040 --> 01:47:38,368
He has a show from Friday August 14th

1822
01:47:38,880 --> 01:47:40,672
It goes to the the park

1823
01:47:41,184 --> 01:47:42,208
Boston nights at the park

1824
01:47:42,464 --> 01:47:44,256
Rodger Stone eulogizing

1825
01:47:44,768 --> 01:47:46,816
Some video about Maxine Waters

1826
01:47:47,072 --> 01:47:48,352
And then

1827
01:47:48,864 --> 01:47:50,144
August 17th

1828
01:47:50,400 --> 01:47:50,912
Monday

1829
01:47:51,424 --> 01:47:53,216
There's no Sunday show on here

1830
01:47:54,496 --> 01:47:55,776
It's it's been taken down

1831
01:47:56,032 --> 01:47:56,544
Interesting

1832
01:47:57,056 --> 01:47:58,848
They don't do that he doesn't retract

1833
01:47:59,872 --> 01:48:02,944
You know they don't do that I don't see that happening

1834
01:48:03,200 --> 01:48:06,016
Regularly with Alex's show

1835
01:48:06,528 --> 01:48:08,064
Where things are just gone

1836
01:48:08,320 --> 01:48:09,344
And I think it's

1837
01:48:09,600 --> 01:48:11,648
Probably because this isn't fair

1838
01:48:13,696 --> 01:48:16,768
Maybe a little baby a little bit of baby a little bit of

1839
01:48:17,280 --> 01:48:18,048
Yeah

1840
01:48:18,304 --> 01:48:22,400
I understand it sucks

1841
01:48:22,656 --> 01:48:23,424
You get

1842
01:48:24,192 --> 01:48:26,496
You chopped I think Alex is going to put a

1843
01:48:27,776 --> 01:48:29,056
Horse's head

1844
01:48:31,872 --> 01:48:33,408
Saturno

1845
01:48:33,920 --> 01:48:36,224
Obviously somebody will refuse

1846
01:48:37,248 --> 01:48:38,784
I want to say that I wish him well

1847
01:48:41,856 --> 01:48:48,000
No I want to say I wish you more and utter confusion for forever

1848
01:48:48,256 --> 01:48:52,608
Yeah it was pretty fun

1849
01:48:52,864 --> 01:48:53,888
Watch

1850
01:48:54,144 --> 01:48:59,264
About shadowgate helps understand

1851
01:48:59,520 --> 01:49:04,384
It makes it more enjoyable for us to see him

1852
01:49:04,640 --> 01:49:06,432
Competently

1853
01:49:06,944 --> 01:49:07,456
Alex

1854
01:49:08,224 --> 01:49:14,368
I mean look I I feel like my advice would be like hire better people but as soon as it comes out of my mouth

1855
01:49:16,416 --> 01:49:21,536
The path of the career

1856
01:49:21,792 --> 01:49:25,120
Has led to a point where you can't get anyone good to work for you

1857
01:49:25,376 --> 01:49:28,192
Give these people to work for you

1858
01:49:28,448 --> 01:49:28,960
Sure

1859
01:49:29,216 --> 01:49:32,288
Billy's going to be able to get some great footage of yelling at protesters

1860
01:49:32,800 --> 01:49:35,616
Pretty regularly you'll be able to get that it'll be great

1861
01:49:35,872 --> 01:49:36,384
But

1862
01:49:36,640 --> 01:49:37,920
Whenever he gets a shoes

1863
01:49:38,176 --> 01:49:40,992
You might end up with something like this cuz she has no instincts

1864
01:49:43,296 --> 01:49:45,600
And be like this guy is the greatest expert ever

1865
01:49:45,856 --> 01:49:48,928
You should have run the other way and blocked him on Twitter like Dan bongino

1866
01:49:49,952 --> 01:49:50,464
Pennywise

1867
01:49:50,976 --> 01:49:51,488
What's on

1868
01:49:52,256 --> 01:49:53,280
It never occurred to me

1869
01:49:54,816 --> 01:49:55,328
If this guy is

1870
01:49:55,584 --> 01:49:56,096
It's telling me

1871
01:49:56,608 --> 01:49:58,144
Even people that I

1872
01:49:58,912 --> 01:50:00,960
It's like even people that are in my unit

1873
01:50:01,728 --> 01:50:02,496
Refuse to talk to

1874
01:50:03,264 --> 01:50:04,288
Maybe I should

1875
01:50:05,312 --> 01:50:06,336
And said she was like

1876
01:50:07,104 --> 01:50:08,384
This is a scoop

1877
01:50:08,640 --> 01:50:11,968
For me this is a scoop that's too dangerous for everyone else to touch

1878
01:50:13,248 --> 01:50:14,272
2

1879
01:50:15,040 --> 01:50:15,552
Yep

1880
01:50:16,320 --> 01:50:22,464
Jordan

1881
01:50:29,120 --> 01:50:32,192
I felt like it's always difficult to figure out exactly how to end

1882
01:50:35,008 --> 01:50:36,032
Offended

1883
01:50:36,288 --> 01:50:38,848
Doesn't feel all that gratifying to have a wrap-up of

1884
01:50:39,360 --> 01:50:42,176
So my point is Alex is dumb

1885
01:50:42,432 --> 01:50:43,200
There's a little bit

1886
01:50:44,992 --> 01:50:46,016
Hi I'm calling this

1887
01:50:46,528 --> 01:50:47,040
Do you understand

1888
01:50:48,064 --> 01:50:48,832
New knowledge

1889
01:50:49,600 --> 01:50:50,368
Phone number

1890
01:50:51,648 --> 01:50:52,928
Call Dad

1891
01:50:53,440 --> 01:50:54,208
Because

1892
01:50:54,720 --> 01:50:55,232
You said that

1893
01:50:55,488 --> 01:50:56,000
Phone number

1894
01:50:57,536 --> 01:50:58,048
Why not

1895
01:50:59,584 --> 01:51:00,096
So I think

1896
01:51:00,352 --> 01:51:02,400
Think what I've decided my call was going to be

1897
01:51:02,912 --> 01:51:04,192
Couple months ago

1898
01:51:05,472 --> 01:51:06,240
You guys are

1899
01:51:06,496 --> 01:51:07,008
Twitter

1900
01:51:07,520 --> 01:51:08,032
Instead

1901
01:51:08,800 --> 01:51:09,568
Qanon anonymous

1902
01:51:09,824 --> 01:51:10,336
Crossover

1903
01:51:10,848 --> 01:51:11,360
When

1904
01:51:11,872 --> 01:51:13,152
And

1905
01:51:13,408 --> 01:51:14,176
You both

1906
01:51:14,688 --> 01:51:15,456
Very nice

1907
01:51:15,712 --> 01:51:16,224
Twitter

1908
01:51:18,016 --> 01:51:18,528
He's known for

1909
01:51:19,040 --> 01:51:21,088
I realized later the whole reason

1910
01:51:21,344 --> 01:51:22,112
I found your show

1911
01:51:24,928 --> 01:51:25,696
Embarrassing

1912
01:51:26,720 --> 01:51:28,000
So I didn't

1913
01:51:28,256 --> 01:51:29,536
Online

1914
01:51:30,816 --> 01:51:33,120
You guys have a great shell behind

1915
01:51:33,376 --> 01:51:36,192
We appreciate that

1916
01:51:36,448 --> 01:51:42,592
That's a good impulse to feel ashamed honestly

1917
01:51:42,848 --> 01:51:43,360
The fact that he

1918
01:51:43,616 --> 01:51:46,688
Went out of his way to call us and call him cell phone

1919
01:51:46,944 --> 01:51:49,248
I respect him more

1920
01:51:49,504 --> 01:51:55,648
Yes perfect point and that is that I don't know how to make a custom echo.and

1921
01:51:55,904 --> 01:51:57,440
Message so it is just a weird voice

1922
01:51:57,696 --> 01:52:03,840
That doesn't say knowledge fight or anything so I noticed a trend of a lot of people's messages

1923
01:52:04,096 --> 01:52:06,144
Start with

1924
01:52:06,400 --> 01:52:07,168
No it's right

1925
01:52:10,752 --> 01:52:11,520
Every time

1926
01:52:11,776 --> 01:52:17,920
I say hello they don't know that it's me

1927
01:52:18,176 --> 01:52:18,688

It really is

1943
01:53:07,328 --> 01:53:09,120
Something I enjoy listening to at work

1944
01:53:09,888 --> 01:53:10,656

1945
01:53:11,168 --> 01:53:11,936

She just giggled and I was like

1971
01:54:49,472 --> 01:54:55,616
This is the happiest I've ever felt much better than you

1972
01:54:55,872 --> 01:55:02,016
That might just be because of familiarity with you

1973

And then next to it like a giant quarter

1982
01:55:35,296 --> 01:55:37,856
You know look for scale

Recommend

1989
01:56:04,480 --> 01:56:10,624

01:56:51,840 --> 01:56:54,144
Can find episodes

2011
01:56:54,656 --> 01:56:59,008
And also to point out that we have a lot of

2012
01:56:59,520 --> 01:57:00,800
Call ziv ComEd

2013
01:57:01,056 --> 01:57:02,592

Their questions that kind of require

2016
01:57:11,808 --> 01:57:17,184
Maybe some props for larger conversation

2017
01:57:17,440 --> 01:57:23,584
And so I feel like they would be more appropriate in an isolated like sort of special setting as opposed to

2018
01:57:23,840 --> 01:57:29,984
As part of our episodes question being able to play the clip of

2019
